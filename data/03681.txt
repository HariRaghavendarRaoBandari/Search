Abstract

A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type I universe has been studied with

the ghost dark energy (GDE) in the framework of Brans-Dicke theory. For this purpose,

we use the squared sound speed v2

s whose sign determines the stability of the model. At

ﬁrst, we obtain the equation of state parameter, ωΛ, the deceleration parameter q and the

evolution equation of the ghost dark energy. Then, we extend our study to the case of ghost

dark energy in a non-isotropic and Brans-Dicke framework and ﬁnd out that the transition

of ωΛ to the phantom regime can be more easily accounted for than when it is restored into

the Einstein ﬁeld equations. Our numerical result show the eﬀects of the interaction and

anisotropic on the evolutionary behaviour the ghost dark energy models. In conclusion, we

ﬁnd evidence that the ghost dark energy in BD theory can lead to a stable universe favored

by observations at the present time.

INTRODUCTIONS

Accelerating expansion of the universe [1, 2] can be explained either by a missing energy com-

ponent usually called ”dark energy” (DE) with an exotic equation of state (EoS), or by modifying

the underlying theory of gravity on large scales. The other models of DE have been discussed

widely in literature considering a cosmological constant [3], a canonical scalar ﬁeld (quintessence)

[4], a phantom ﬁeld, that is a scalar ﬁeld with a negative sign of the kinetic term [5, 6], or the

combination of quintessence and phantom in a uniﬁed model named quintom [7]. A new model

of DE, under the name of Veneziano ghost dark energy (GDE), has been recently proposed [8, 9].

Veneziano ghost is supposed to exist for solving the U (1), a problem in low-energy eﬀective theory

of QCD [10–13], although it is completely decoupled from the physical sector [13]. One clariﬁ-

cation is that there are some DE models where the ghost plays the role of DE (see, e.g., [14])

and becomes a real propagating physical degree of freedom subjected to some severe constraints.

They have explored a dark energy model with a ghost scalar ﬁeld in the context of the runaway

dilaton scenario in low-energy eﬀective string theory and addressed the problem of vacuum stabil-

ity by implementing higher-order derivative terms and shown that a cosmologically viable model

of ”phantomized”DE can be constructed without violating the stability of quantum ﬂuctuations.

However, the Veneziano ghost is not a new physical propagating degree of freedom and therefore

the GDE model does not violate unitarity, causality, gauge invariance and other important features

of renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theory, as advocated in [15–17].

In recent years, scalar tensor theories have been studied extensively. The reason comes from the

fact that scalar ﬁelds appear in diﬀerent branches of theoretical physics as a consistency condition.

For example, the low energy limit of the string theory leads to introducing a scalar degree of

freedom. One important example of the scalar tensor theories is the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of

gravity which was presented by Brans and Dicke in 1961 to incorporate the Mach’s principle in the

Einstein’s theory of gravity [18]. This theory also passed the observational tests in the solar system

domain [19]. Since the GDE model have a dynamic behavior it is more reasonable to consider this

model in a dynamical framework such as BD theory. It was shown that some features of original

GDE in BD cosmology diﬀer from Einstein’s gravity [21]. For example while the original GDE is

instable in all range of the parameter spaces in standard cosmology [20], it leads to a stable phase

in BD theory [22].

Recent experimental data as well as theoretical arguments support the existence of anisotropic

expansion phase, which evolves into an isotropic one. This very fact forces one to study evolution

of the universe with the anisotropic background. The possible eﬀects of anisotropy in the early

universe have been studied with Bianchi I type models from diﬀerent points of view [23–25]. Re-

cently, [26] have shown the importance of BI model to discuss the eﬀects of anisotropy on the basis

of recent evidences. In this paper, we study a cosmological model of late acceleration based on the

GDE model in the framework of non-isotropic BD cosmology.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the interacting GDE model in

an anisotropic universe. In Sect. III, we formulate the ﬁeld equations of BD theory for BI universe

and provide the solution to the ﬁeld equations with interaction between dark matter and DE. In

Sects. IV and V, we explore the stability of the GDE model in all discussed cases of Sects. II and

3

III. We ﬁnish with closing remarks in Sect. VI.

II. METRIC AND GHOST DARK ENERGY MODEL

We onsider a class of homogeneous and anisotropic models where the line element is of the

Bianhi type I,

ds2 = dt2 − A2(t)dx2 − B2(t)dy2 − C 2(t)dz2,

(1)

with A, B, C being the functions of time only. This model is an anisotropic generalization of

the Friedmann model with Euclidean spatial geometry. Note that the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) is

recovered when one takes B = C. The contribution of the interaction with the matter ﬁelds is

given by the energy momentum tensor which, is this case, is deﬁned as

T µ
ν = diag[ρ,−ωρ,−ωρ,−ωρ],

(2)

where ρ and ω represent the energy density and EoS parameter respectively.

In a co-moving

coordinate system (ui = δi

0), Einstein’s ﬁeld equations for BI metric given in (1) lead to the

following system of equations [27]:

3H 2 − σ2 =

where M 2

p = 1/(8πG), ρΛ and pΛ are the Planck mass, the energy density and pressure of dark

energy, respectively, and a = (ABC)

ui,j + 1
distortion of the matter ﬂow, and θ = 3H = uj

3 θ(gij + uiuj) is the shear tensor, which describes the rate of
;j is the scalar expansion. It may be pointed out

here that if one sets σ = 0, the equations reduce to that obtained for a ﬂat FRW universe. Thus

when the universe is suﬃciently large it behaves like a ﬂat universe.

We investigate the GDE model in the framework of Einstein gravity. The GDE density is given by

[9, 28]

ρΛ = αH,

(6)

where α is a constant with dimension [energy]3, and roughly of order of Λ3

QCD where ΛQCD ∼

where ρ = ρΛ + ρm and p = pΛ. Note that the model is considered to pressureless DM (pm = 0).

The recent observational evidence provided by the galaxy clusters also supports the interaction

between dark energy and dark matter [29]. In the presence of interaction, the continuity equations

are

˙ρΛ + 3HρΛ(1 + ωΛ) = −Q,
˙ρm + 3Hρm = Q,

(12)

(13)

where ωΛ = pΛ/ρΛ is the EoS parameter of the interacting DE and Q stands for the interaction
term. Following [30, 31], we shall assume Q = 3b2H(ρm + ρΛ) with the coupling constant b2.

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (3) with respect to time, we obtain

given in Eq. (12), we have

ωΛ = −1 + Ωσ

One can easily check that in the late time where ΩΛ → 1 and Ωσ → 0, the equation of state

parameter of interacting ghost dark energy necessary crosses the phantom line, namely, ωΛ =
−(1 + 2b2) < −1 independent of the value of coupling constant b2. For present time with taking
Ωσ = 0.001 and Ω0
Λ = 0.69, the phantom crossing can be achieved provided b2 > 0.1. The evolution
of the EoS parameter (15) are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 for two diﬀerent value of the b2 and Ωσ,

respectively. Figures clear that the evolution of ωΛ increases at early times and decreases at late
times but as a → 0, it is clear that the EoS parameter decreases and increases with increasing Ωσ
and b2, respectively. Also from Fig. 1 we see that ωΛ of the GDE can cross the phantom divide.
In the limiting case of the FRW universe it was argued [32] that without interaction (b2 = 0)

ωΛ is always larger than −1 and cannot cross the phantom divide while in the presence of the
interaction the situation is changed. An interesting observation from Fig. 2 is that ωΛ cannot

cross the phantom divide. In the presence of interaction the deceleration parameter is obtained by

substituting (15) in (14) and using (11). The result is

where ΩΛ is given by Eq. (18). The evolution of the cosmological parameter q for diﬀerent values
of b2 and Ωσ is plotted in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. In this case, taking Ω0
Λ = 0.69, b2 = 0.15
and Ωσ = 0.001 leads to q ∼ −0.7 which is consistent with observations [33]. From Figs. 3 and 4,
one can verify that q decreases from (0.6) to (−1) during evolution of the universe. Recent studies

have constructed q(z) takeing into account that the strongest evidence of accelerations happens at
redshift of z ∼ 0.2. In order to do this, they have set q(z) = 1/2(q1z + q2)/(1 + z)2 to reconstruct
it and after that they have obtained q(z) ∼ −0.31 by ﬁtting this model to the observational data
[34]. Under these conditions and considering the Eq. (16), we obtain constrain on b2 in the form

b2 = 0.01, which show the acceleration of the universe. Taking the time derivative of ΩΛ in Eq.

with sharper slope. II) At early and late times, ΩΛ increases and decreases with increasing b2,
respectively. Also Figs. 5 and 6 shows that at the early time ΩΛ → 0 while at the late time
ΩΛ → 1, that is the GDE dominates as expected in an anisotropic universe.

where ω0 and Lm represent the constant BD parameter and the matter part of the Lagrangian

respectively. Here we have taken 8πG0 = c = 1. In particular we may expect that φ is spatially

uniform, but varies slowly with time. The nonminimal coupling term φ2R where R is the Ricci

scalar, replaces with the Einstein-Hilbert term 1

the action consists of a scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to Einstein’s gravity. General relativity is

recovered in the limit ω0 → ∞ and φ = const. ≡ 1/G. We now apply this theory to a homogeneous
and anisotropic cosmology of the Bianchi type I, expressed by the metric (1), together with the

energy-momentum tensor speciﬁed by Eq. (2). The signature here is (+ − −−), and the Ricci
tensor is given by Rµν = Rγ

We shall assume that Brans-Dick ﬁeld can be described as power low of the scale factor, φ = aǫ.

A case of particular interest is that when ǫ is small whereas ω0 is high so that the product ǫω0

results of order unity [38]. This is interesting because local astronomical experiments set a very

high lower bound on ω0 [39]; in particular, the Cassini experiment implies that ω0 > 104 [18, 40].

Taking the derivative respect to time with of relation φ = aǫ, we get

˙φ = ǫH.

Combining Eq. (28) with the ﬁrst BI equation (25), we get

For ǫ = 0 (γ = 1), the above equation reduce to (15). The solar-system experiments give the

lower bound for the value of ω0 to be ω0 > 40000 [9]. However, when probing the larger scales,

the limit obtained will be weaker than this result. It was shown [40] that ω0 can be smaller than

40000 on the cosmological scales. Also, Sheykhi et al.

[41] obtained the result for the value of ǫ

is ǫ < 0.01. The GDE model in BD framework has an interesting feature compared to the GDE

model in Einstein’s gravity. In the case of the noninteracting DE b2 = 0, the EoS parameter of in

the BD framework, requiring condition ωΛ < −1 leads to γ(3 + 2ǫ) + Ωσ(3 − 2ǫ) < 3ΩΛ. Choosing
ΩΛ = 0.69 for the present time, this inequality valid provided we take ǫ = 0.002 which is consistent

with observations. Using Eqs. (34) and (35) the acceleration parameter (11) is obtained as

where ΩΛ is given by Eq. (38). Let us study some special cases of interest for the deceleration
Λ = 0.69, b2 = 0.15, Ωσ = 0.001 and ǫ = 0.002, we obtain q = −0.66,
which is consistent with the present value of the deceleration parameter obtained in [33]. Also this

choice of the parameters result in ωΛ ≈ −1.1 for present time of the universe and one can see the

consistency of the latter with current observations. Transition from deceleration to acceleration

take places at a ≈ 0.26. One may take a look on Fig. 7a for a better insight into the model. The
ﬁrst part of this ﬁgure indicates that one can generate a phantom-like behavior provided ǫ < 0.01.

Also from Fig. 7b we see that ωΛ of the GDE in BD theory can cross the phantom divide and
eventually the universe approaches a de-Sitter phase of expansion (ωΛ → −1) at late time. Fig. 8
indicates that at the late time ΩΛ → 1, which is similar to the behaviour of the original GDE in
previous section. We can also obtain the evolution behavior of the DE. Taking the derivative of

(31), we ﬁnd

˙ΩΛ = −ΩΛH(

˙H
H 2 + 2ǫ).

Substituting Eqs. (34) and (35) into (37) and using relation ˙ΩΛ = Ω′Λ, we get

It is worth to mentioning that all relations we obtained in this section restor their respective

expressions in the previous section when we set b2 = 0 as we expect. We plot in Fig. 8 the

11

evolutions of ΩΛ with diﬀerent Ωσ. Figure shows that for a given Ωσ, ΩΛ increases when the

scale factor increases but at early and late times, ΩΛ decreases and decreases with increasing Ωσ,

respectively.

IV. A BI UNIVERSE AND INSTABILITY OF THE GDE MODEL

The parameter we use through this paper as a factor of stability of the model is the square sound

speed v2

s . In classical perturbation theory we assume a small ﬂuctuation in the background of the

energy density and we would like to see whether the perturbation will grow or collapse. In the linear

perturbation regime, the perturbed energy density of the background is ρ(t, x) = ρ(t) + δρ(t, x),
where ρ(t) is unperturbed background energy density. The energy conservation equation ∇µT µν
yields [3]

δ ¨ρ = v2

s∇2δρ(t, x),

(39)

where v2

s = dp/dρ is the square of the sound speed. Solutions of (39) include two cases of interest.

First when v2
s is positive, the Eq. (39) becomes an ordinary wave equation whose solutions would
be oscillatory waves of the form δρ = δρ0eiωt+i−→k .−→x which indicates a propagation mode for the
density perturbations. The second case of interest occurs when v2
s is negative. In this case the

frequency of the oscillations becomes purly imaginary and the density perturbations will grow with
time as δρ = δρ0eωt+i−→k .−→x . Here we would like to obtain the sound speed in a BI background ﬁlled
with pressureless matter and GDE while matter and DE components are separately conserved.

The deﬁnition of the sound speed reads [42]

which is the squared sound speed for interacting GDE ﬂuid. The evolution of v2

s for diﬀerent values

of b2 and Ωσ is plotted in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. The ﬁgures reveals that v2

s is always negative

and thus, as the previous case, a background ﬁlled with the interacting GDE seems to be unstable

against the perturbation. This implies that we cannot obtain a stable GDE dominated universe in

BI models. One important point is the sensitivity of the instability to the coupling parameter b2.

The larger b2, leads to more either instability against perturbations or vice versa of the Ωσ.

Once again setting ǫ = 0 and σ = 0 leads to the results of the original GDE in FRW universe. The

evolution of v2

s versus ΩΛ has been plotted in Figs. 11 and 12. This ﬁgures reveals that v2

s is either

positive or negative. This ﬁgures reveals that v2

s is always negative except for a small period at

the present of the universe. This implies that we can obtain a stable GDE dominated universe in

BD theory in the present time.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have considered the Ghost dark energy (GDE) model in Bianchi I cosmologies

with Brans-Dicke theory.

In this framework the GDE in two distinct cases is studied. First

14

of all, the GDE with the interaction between DM and GDE in an anisotropic background is

explored. Considering the interaction between the two diﬀerent dark components of the universe,

the evolution of the universe was studied from early deceleration to the late time acceleration. It

was observed that, in the presence of interaction, the equation of state parameter can cross −1 at
the present time provided that the interacting parameter satisfy b2 > 0.1.

In the next section, the BI metric with GDE scenario has been studied in the context of BD theory.

An interesting feature, which we found, was the capability of crossing the phantom line in this case.

We discussed this result explicitly by a numerical evaluation and ωΛ, q and ΩΛ were plotted for

all the cases. Moreover, we have used the squared sound speed (v2

s = dp/dρ) as the main factor

to study the stability of the GDE. When v2

s is positive, the GDE could be stable with respect to

perturbations, while if v2

s is negative, we encounter signs of instability in the background spacetime.

As a result, a BI universe ﬁlled with dark matter and GDE component in BD gravity can lead
to a stable GDE with b2 ≥ 0.09 in the present time. Besides ΩΛ and Ωm in standard Einstein
cosmology, another density parameter, Ωσ, is expected by the anisotropy. This theory implies that

if Ωσ is zero then it yields the FRW universe model.
