ABSTRACT
Using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Expectation Maximization Algorithm,
we perform an analysis of time duration (T90) for CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT
and Fermi/GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts. The T90 distributions of 298 redshift-known
Swift/BAT GRBs have also been studied in both observer and rest frames. Bayesian
Information Criterion has been used to compare between diﬀerent GMM models. We
ﬁnd that two Gaussian components are better to describe the CGRO/BATSE and
Fermi/GBM GRBs in the observer frame. Also, we caution that two groups are ex-
pected for the Swift/BAT bursts in the rest frame, which is consistent with some
previous results. However, Swift GRBs in the observer frame seem to show a trimodal
distribution, of which the superﬁcial intermediate class may result from the selection
eﬀect of Swift/BAT.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gamma-ray bursts(GRBs) are the most energetic astronom-
ical explosive phenomena in the universe, the energy re-
leased in a single event is huge(1051 ∼ 1054ergs). They have
been intensely studied since 1990s, especially after the op-
eration of BATSE onboard Compton Gamma Ray Observa-
tory (CGRO) (Meegan et al. 1992) (e.g Zhang & M´esz´aros
2004; Nakar 2007; Zhang 2007; Gehrels et al. 2009; Zhang
2011; Berger 2014). However, the classiﬁcation of GRBs re-
mains unsolved. Kouveliotou et al. (1993) found that the
logT90 distribution of 222 GRBs in BATSE 1B Catalog fol-
lows a bimodal form with a dividing line of T90 (cid:39) 2.0s(see
also McBreen et al. 1994), namely Long GRBs(LGRBs) and
Short GRBs(SGRBs) that are widely known. The two classes
are believed to have diﬀerent physical origins, for example,
SGRBs could be the product of merging of compact bina-
ries, like NS-NS or NS-BH(Nakar 2007; Zhang et al. 2009),
while LGRBs are tightly related with massive star explosions
(Woosley & Bloom 2006). Zhang & Choi (2008) studied the
time durations of 95 Swift GRBs with known redshift, and
found that the observed and intrinsic durations of GRBs
in Swift era still show a bimodal distribution. LGRBs and
SGRBs show diﬀerences in spectral hardness, hosts galax-
ies etc(see Zhang 2011 for review). In addition, short bursts,

compared with long ones, have no obvious spectral evolution
(e.g. Norris & Bonnell 2006; Zhang et al. 2006), relatively
symmetric pulse and larger oﬀset from their central engines
(Zhang et al. 2007a,b; Berger 2010, 2014; Fong et al. 2015).
More interestingly, short and long GRBs share the same cor-
relation between the peak luminosity and the peak energy,
which means the two classes may be dominated by thermal
emission from the photosphere, rather than the synchrotron
radiation itself (Zhang et al. 2012).

However, Horv´ath (1998, 2002) investigated the GRBs
in BATSE catalogue, which contains 797 (Horv´ath 1998)
and 1929 (Horv´ath 2002) bursts separately, and found that
there maybe a third class of GRBs with a rejection probabil-
ity less than 0.5%. Similar evidences were found in datasets
of BeppoSAX (Horv´ath 2009), Swift/BAT(Horv´ath et al.
2008), Fermi/GBM (Tarnopolski 2015) etc. All those analy-
ses of T90 distribution by χ2 ﬁtting (Horv´ath 1998; Tarnopol-
ski 2015) or Maximum Likelihood method (Horv´ath 2002;
Horv´ath et al. 2008; Horv´ath 2009) seem to show that three-
Gaussian(3-G) distribution is better than two-Gaussian(2-
G) statistically, despite the the detector dependence(Katz
et al. 1996; Nakar 2007). Swift’s higher sensitivity and
angular resolution(Gehrels et al. 2004) than the previous
missions(e.g. BATSE, BeppoSAX and HETE-2) make the
quick follow-up observation and measuring of SGRBs’ red-
shift possible. Zitouni et al. (2015) analysed 248 Swift/BAT
GRBs with known redshift and conﬁrmed that statistical

2

test prefers three groups instead of two. The existence of
this third class being physical or not is still unclear.

Further more, some GRBs have another interesting fea-
ture of soft extended emissions(EE) after a hard initial
pulse. The most ultimate example is GRB060614(Gehrels
et al. 2006). It’s T90 is 102s, placing it in LGRB zone ob-
viously. However the spectral analysis of its initial pulse
shows similar properties with Swift short bursts. Such kinds
of bursts also exist in datasets of BATSE, Swift and Fermi
(Norris & Bonnell 2006; Norris et al. 2010; Bostancı et al.
2013; Hu et al. 2014; Kaneko et al. 2015). SGRBs with ex-
tended emission(GRB-EE) challenge the T90 = 2.0s classiﬁca-
tion method, since LGRBs could also be SGRBs physically.
Norris & Bonnell (2006) found that the spectral lag of the
initial pulse of GRB-EE samples are negligible, which is con-
sistent with SGRBs’ properties(see also Zhang et al. 2006;
Kaneko et al. 2015).

Note that part of the previous analyses had been per-
formed under χ2 ﬁtting. The input data of χ2 ﬁtting must
be the binned data, which means the output result will be
aﬀected by the binning process in a sense. Maximum Likeli-
hood method(ML) is always used to avoid the eﬀect from bin
size. In this paper, we performed ML-like analysis of T90 dis-
tributions of datasets in both CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT,
and Fermi/GBM using Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM)
and Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. This paper is or-
ganized as follows. The datasets and analysis methods are in-
troduced in Sect. 2. Our main results are displayed in Sect. 3.
Discussion and conclusion are given in Sect. 4 and Sect. 5
respectively.

2 DATA SELECTION AND METHODS

2.1 Data Selection

• CGRO/BATSE
CGRO-BATSE current catalog contains 2702 entries 1,
We selected 2037 samples with valid T90 value to perform
the density estimation. At the same time, 1937 subsamples
with valid ﬂuence values of 25-50keV and 100-350keV were
selected to investigate the duration and spectral hardness
relationship.

• Swift/BAT
For Swift/BAT, two datasets, Swift/BAT-I(Donato et al.
2014) and the Swift/BAT-II 2 were investigated. Swift/BAT-
I contains all bursts observed by Swift from the beginning
of the mission, 20 Nov 2004 up to 31 Dec 2012. Swift/BAT-
II will be updated when there are newly detected GRBs by
BAT and it has larger sample size than Swift/BAT-I.

In Swift/BAT-I, 708 samples have measured T90 values
while 681 of them also have valid HR31 (deﬁned as the ratio
of the ﬂuence in the 50-100 keV and in the 15-25 keV energy
ranges, S50−100keV /S15−25keV ).

For Swift/BAT-II, entered by Dec 15, 2015, we selected
956 samples with valid T90 as our candidate, and 298 of them

method and the catalog(von Kienlin et al. 2014) value of Fermi
samples’ average energy ﬂux. The red dashed line is equality line.

with known redshift were used to investigate the distribution
of T90 in the rest frame 3.

• Fermi/GBM
GBM catalog (von Kienlin et al. 2014) contains 1741
GRBs. Since it doesn’t provide eﬀective ﬂuence data like
BATSE catalog, we calculated the hardness ratio following
the description in (von Kienlin et al. 2014). Compton model
is used during the ﬂux(F(E)) calculation at a given energy
E, so the hardness ratio can be calculated with the “Comp-
tonized”(COMP) photon model parameters:

F(E) = A(

25keV F(E)· EdE

(2)

We compared our calculated average energy ﬂux of
10∼1000keV and the value in the catalog, the result is shown
in Figure 1. Finally, 1594 samples with valid T90, COMP
spectral index α, and COMP Epeak were chosen from GBM
catalog as the candidates.

The T90 distribution of our datasets are shown in Fig-
ure 2,both CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT-II and Fermi/GBM
are included. There are couple of binning rules that com-
monly accepted by the literature, like Freedman(Freedman
& Diaconis 1981), Scott(Scott 1979), Knuth(Knuth 2006)
etc. Knuth rule were used throughout this paper. All density
ﬁgures are normalized to represent the probability distribu-
tion function(PDF). The integration of PDF over the input
parameter space will be 1.

2.2 Samples with Extended Emission

We selected BATSE GRB-EE samples with references to
Norris & Bonnell (2006); Bostancı et al. (2013), and Norris
et al. (2010); Bostancı et al. (2013); Hu et al. (2014) for
Swift, Kaneko et al. (2015) for Fermi.

Two diﬀerent methods were used by these authors
to identify extended emission from the GRBs lightcurves,
namely Bayesian Block method (Scargle et al. 2013; Norris &
Bonnell 2006; Norris et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2014) and Signal-
to-Noise Ratio based method (Bostancı et al. 2013; Kaneko
et al. 2015). The detailed GRB-EE samples are listed in Ap-
pendix A.

2.3 Analysis Method

To avoid the eﬀect from bin width to the regular histogram
analysis, Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) was applied to
the analysis of T90 distributions under the python Machine
Learning package scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011). GMM
is a parametric probabilistic density function representing a
weighted sum of Gaussian component(Ci,i = 1,2,··· ,k) den-
sities. Each component generates data from a Gaussian dis-
tribution with mean µi and covariance matrix Σi,It gives the
probability density function p(x) of data x as

GMM method uses Expectation-Maximization algo-
rithm (EM algorithm) to determine the parameters. EM
algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning technique,
which is used to ﬁnd best parameters for a given model.
Its iteration alternates between performing E steps and M
steps. Assuming that on the tth iteration, the parameters or
the estimates be

θt = {ωi(t), µi(t),Σi(t), (i = 1,2,··· ,k))}

the whole process can be described as follows:

(i) Initialize the input parameter θinit ,like k, µ,Σ
(ii) Expectation Step (E step): compute the expected
value of the log likelihood function with the current param-
eter and the ’responsibility’ of each gaussian component Ci

τi j(t) = p(Ci|x j,θt ) =

p(x j|Ci,θt )p(Ci|θt )

that, for larger N, BIC always tend to choose those models
having smaller k.

BIC always choose model with the smallest value BICmin
as the best model for estimation. For the other candidate
models, BIC diﬀerence will be used to illustrate the evi-
dence against the best model(Burnham & Anderson 2004;
Tarnopolski 2016). This BIC diﬀerence is deﬁned as
∆i = BICi − BICmin

(12)

where i means the ith model. For the best model, BIC
diﬀerence will be ∆i = 0. 0 < ∆i < 2 means ith model is also
supported. The evidence against this model is weak. If 2 <
∆i < 6, the evidence against this model is positive. For those
models with ∆i > 6, the evidence against them will be strong,
and very strong if ∆i > 10.

3.1 T90 density estimation in the observer frame

We applied GMM method to all datasets of three detec-
tors, source frame and observer frame, under scikit-learn.
We tried the number of Gaussian components range from 1
to 9 which is k in Sect 2.3.

In scikit-learn, there are four ways to calculate the co-
variance matrix, ‘full’, ‘diag’, ‘spherical’,and ‘tied’. The ﬁrst
three are similar to each other, they set diﬀerent Σ to each
Gaussian component. ‘diag’ and ‘spherical’ are always ap-
plied whenever the sample size are very big and need to
speed up the calculation process of the programme. With
enough iteration, ‘diag’ and ‘spherical’ would gain the same
results as ‘full’. The last way, the ‘tied’ one uses the same
Σ for diﬀerent Gaussian components, which is unnatural for
GRBs’ logT90 distribution. Considering this, we only show
the results of ‘full’ in this paper.

Our results are displayed in Figure 3,4,5,6, respectively.
The ﬁnal parameters are listed in Table 2. The backgrounds
are histograms of logT90 following Knuth rule in all ﬁgures,
aiming to compare with the PDF of the GMM analysis. The
results of BIC evaluation are shown in Figure 7. In the fol-
lowing description, we use 2-G-F and 3-G-F as labels of dif-
ferent models, e.g. 2-G-F represents mixture of 2 Gaussian
components with covariance type being set to ‘full’.

(i) CGRO/BATSE
As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, for the BATSE dataset,
BIC prefers 2-G-F model, the minimum value is 4912.661.
The weights for the two Gaussian components are 33.3% and
66.7% separately. The ∆i value for 3-G-F is 13.518, which
means very strong evidence against it.

(ii) Swift/BAT
For two Swift datasets, displayed in Figure 4,5, BIC
prefers the same model, 3-G-F. Minimum BIC values are
1548.355 for Swift/BAT-I and 2120.804 for Swift/BAT-II.
The best parameters of these two datasets are displayed
in Table 2. It is interesting that 3-G-F for Swift/BAT-
II shows a strange PDF, when it is compared the other
datasets. Zitouni et al. (2015) did similar work with 757
Swift table GRBs with χ2 ﬁtting, and conﬁrmed the non-
symmetric shape of the logT90 distribution in the LGRBs
area. Tarnopolski (2016) studied the duration distribution of
947 GRBs in the Swift table using maximum log-likelihood

(iv) Repeat E steps and M steps until the total log likeli-

hood logP(X|ω, µ,Σ) doesn’t change signiﬁcantly1.

The last step can also be described as follows, with the
parameters, one can calculate the probabilities of one date x j
belongs to the one of the k components, and assign the x j to
the component with the max probability. If this assignment
doesn’t change any more, the parameters are the ﬁnal one.
Numerically, the mixture of ﬁnite Gaussian components
can describe the dataset “perfectly”, but will run into over-
ﬁtting condition. To avoid this, we use Information Criterion
to compare between mixture models with diﬀerent number
of Gaussian components.

2.4 Statistical Criteria

As described in Sect 2.3, using EM algorithm, one can get
the best PDF of the data with mixture of k Gaussian com-
ponents. Theoretically, it is always possible to increase the
logarithmic likelihood value by using more free parame-
ters(larger k). However, improper value of k will causing
either over-ﬁtting or under-ﬁtting of the data. How to de-
cide the best value of k is the problem of model selection. For
model selection, Akaike Information Criterion(AIC)(Akaike
1974) and Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC) (Schwarz
1978) are widely used statistical criterion in some astrophys-
ical problems (Burnham & Anderson 2004; Liddle 2007). In
our analysis, we prefer BIC, since it take the sample size into
consideration.

BIC was ﬁrst introduced by Schwarz (1978), and can be

calculated as
BIC = plnN − 2lnPmax

(11)

where Pmax is the maximum likelihood achieved by the
models. p is the number of the parameters of the models,
and N is the sample size. From Eq. 11, one can ﬁgure out

1 In our analysis, 10−10 was used to judge the log likelihood con-
verged or not.

method. He got a best model with mixture of 3 standard
Gaussians and the minimum BIC value is 2103.192, while
2104.968 for mixture 2 standard Gaussians. Considering
the diﬀerent size of datasets, it is acceptable that the best
PDF might be diﬀerent. One thing can be sure that there
is a ’shoulder’ between SGRBs area and LGRBs area of
Swift/BAT GRBs.

BIC choose 2-G-F as the best model with minimum value
3258.166 for Fermi/GBM, see Figure 6. As displayed in Ta-
ble 2, the ∆i value for 3-G-F is 13.746, which means the
evidence against it is very strong. This result is consistent
with the result of BATSE.

3.2 Swift GRBs with known redshift

Using 298 redshift-known Swift/BAT-II samples, we also did
the density estimation of T90 in both the observer and rest
frames. The intrinsic duration T90,int can be calculated by

T90,int =

T90,obs

(13)

Our comparable results are displayed in Figure 8 for the
observer frame and Figure 9 for the rest frame. The ﬁnal
parameters are listed in Table 3. The BIC evaluation for
diﬀerent model are displayed in Figure 10.

(i) Observer Frame
In the case of observer frame, BIC choose 2-G-F model,
which is contrary to the analysis of Swift datasets in Sec-
tion 3.1. Zhang & Choi (2008) analysed 99 redshift-known
Swift sample and found 2-G model was supported in the
observer frame. Zitouni et al. (2015) updated their study
with 248 samples, and found 3-G was supported by χ2 ﬁt-
ting. Tarnopolski (2016) did similar study with 347 samples,
and his result strongly supported 2-G model by BIC. Con-
sider diﬀerent sample size, it is possible that diﬀerent studies

tinguishing the initial spike or the extended emission. The
results are displayed in Figure 11, where we ﬁnd, for BATSE
datasets, about half GRB-EE points locate in the SGRB
zone, which may be regarded as the possible origin of the
medium class. For datasets of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM,

there are no SGRBs with EE found in the SGRB regime.
The reason is that diﬀerent detector sensitivity in the EE
energy (below ∼100keV) will aﬀect their ability to detect
the EE contribution. Kaneko et al. (2015) suspect that this
phenomenon is mainly caused by selection bias. In Fig-

ure12, we interestingly ﬁnd that GRBs can be clearly di-
vided two groups in the plane of the logT90 versus the ratio of
logT90/logT50. For the BATSE sample, some LGRBs, SGRBs
with EE and pure SGRBs will be classiﬁed into group-I
(Short-Hard type), while parts of LGRBs and LGRBs with
EE will go to group-II (Long-Soft type). In contrast, no
SGRBs with EE are found in the group-I for the Swift/BAT
and Fermi/GBM samples. However, a few of Fermi LGRBs
will be included the group-I under this way. The classiﬁ-
cation criteria could be consistent with that suggested by
Zhang et al. (2009).
Considering the GRB-EE samples’ unusual behavior in
T90 ∼ HR relationship, we doubt if their existence may aﬀect
the T90 distribution, especially for Swift datasets. To ver-
ify this, we exclude those Swift GRB-EE sample from the
Swift/BAT-I datasets and performed a GMM analysis to the
datasets without EE. The ﬁgure format results are displayed
in Figure 13. The BIC evaluation is displayed in Figure 14.
After excluding GRB-EE samples, BIC still prefers 3-
G-F model as the best one with a minimum BIC value,
1418.936. However, the BIC value for 2-G-F is 1419.657 and
∆i is only 0.721. The ∆i value of 2-G-F model is signiﬁcantly
smaller than 5.558 of 2-G-F for full Swift/BAT-I datasets
as displayed in Table 2. This means the eﬀect bring by the
existence of GRB-EE samples Swift/BAT-I datasets is ob-
vious.

4 DISCUSSION

In Section 3, we displayed our results of density estimation
of GRBs’ duration T90. No consistent results has been ob-
tained by BIC in all main datasets. 3-G-F model is strongly
supported by BIC for two Swift datasets, while 2-G-F model
is strongly supported for Swift datasets with known redshift
in both the observer and rest frames. For BATSE and Fermi
datasets, BIC prefers 2-G-F model with stronger evidence.
We also conﬁrmed the detector dependence of the dura-
tion distribution (Nakar 2007; Gehrels et al. 2009; Qin et al.
2013),as displayed in Figure 2,11 and Table 2. This is mainly
caused by diﬀerent detectors used by BATSE, Swift/BAT
and Fermi/GBM, and there are also diﬀerences in their ef-
fective areas. The eﬀective energy band of Swift/BAT is
15-150keV, which is obviously locate in hard X-ray band
and narrower than coverage of BATSE and Fermi/GBM.
Also considering the durations of GRBs follow a negative
power law relationship by energy(Qin et al. 2013), it is ac-
ceptable that the durations measured by Swift/BAT are
commonly longer than BATSE and Fermi/GBM.

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2016)

From Figure 3,4,5,6 and Figure 8,9, one can easily no-
tice that the overlapping issue is still exist(Nakar 2007), and
there are no clear boundaries between diﬀerent classes. This
make it diﬃcult to judge the class property of a single event
only by it’s durations.

Another possible reason for none consistent results and
overlapping issues might be duration is not a strong ‘stan-
dard’ feature for GRBs’ progenitor. GRBs cannot be classi-
ﬁed just according to the durations of prompt emission.

However, there might be another possible reason, which
is that there might be noise-like radiation when measuring
T90 of some events like GRB-EE. In other words, we still
believe duration can be a good feature to divide diﬀerent
type of progenitors, but need to focus on the primary activity
of the central engine that produce the GRBs’ main pulse. At
the same time, the current evidence of the possible existence
of a third class might be caused by failed measuring of the
duration of this primary activity. As shown in Fig. 11, GRB-
EE locate in the peak of typical LGRBs and their durations
group in the longest peak in the 3-G-F model. The existence
of such samples, not only GRB-EE, and over estimated T90
might aﬀect the distribution of T90.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we studied the duration distributions of
BATSE, Swift and Fermi GRB datasets using Gaussian
Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization Algorithm.
Our main conclusions are

No consistent results were found by our analysis.

• Duration distributions of GRBs are detector dependent.
• Only Swift datasets are strongly support 3-G-F model,
while 2-G-F models are strongly supported by datasets
of BATSE and Fermi. BIC also prefers 2-G-F models for
redshift-known Swift datasets in both the observer and rest
frames.
• Durations parameters in current catalog main contain
some noisy data which will aﬀect its’ distribution. Extended
emission is perhaps a possible source of such noisy data.
• Durations could still be a characteristic feature for cen-

tral engine, but need to focus on the prompt emission.
