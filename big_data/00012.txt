Abstract

We prove two explicit formulae for one-part double Hurwitz numbers with com-
pleted 3-cycles. We deﬁne "combinatorial Hodge integrals" from these numbers in
the spirit of the celebrated ELSV formula. The obtained results imply some explicit
formulae and properties of the combinatorial Hodge integrals.

1 Introduction

1.1 Notation

First of all, let us set up some notations. For a natural number d, a partition µ of d,
denoted by µ ⊢ d, is a sequence of non-decreasing positive integers µ = (µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ ... ≥
µm) such that d = µ1 + ...+ µm. We call m the length of µ, often denoted by l(µ). An-
other way of writing µ is µ = (1m1,2m2,...) which tells us that i appear mi times. Deﬁne
|Autµ| := m1!m2!.... If mi = 0, we can choose to write i or not depending on which is
convenient in each context. We reserve the Greek letters for partitions. The set of all
partitions of d is denoted by Part(d), and the set of all partitions is denoted by Part.

For a series f (z) =P ai zi , we denote£zi¤ f := ai .

1.2 Hurwitz numbers

Hurwitz numbers (in many variants) appeared at the cross-road of many active direc-
tions in contemporary mathematics and mathematical physics, such as the combina-
torics of symmetric groups and graphs on surfaces, the intersection theory in algebraic
geometry, tau functions in integrable systems and tropical geometry (see, for instance
[LZ13; GJV05; KL15; CJM10]).

In their simplest version, given two positive integers d and g , and a partition β of
d, connected (disconnected) single Hurwitz numbers count the number of branched
d-coverings of the Riemann sphere by a connected (possibly disconnected) Riemann
surface of genus g , assuming that one branch point has branching given by β and all
other branch points are simple. A simple branch point is one that has branching given

by the partition¡1d−2,2¢ of d. Some very interesting results connect these objects with

other areas of mathematics. In particular, single Hurwitz numbers satisfy KP equations
[Oko00; Pan00], Virasoro constraints [Ale14] and Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological
recursion [EMS11].

More interesting results have been proved and conjectured for other types of Hur-
witz numbers. Without pretending to be exhaustive, we cite two generalizations which

2

will be important in the sequel, together with a description of their geometric meaning:

g

• Disconnected double Hurwitz numbers H

α,β are deﬁned as the obvious general-
ization of the single ones (we do not consider connected numbers in this article).
They count the number of branched d-coverings of the sphere by a possibly dis-
connected Riemann suface of genus g , where two distinguished points (say ∞
and 0) have branching given by two partitions α and β of d while all other branch
points are simple.

• Disconnected double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles, denoted by H

g,(r )
α,β ,
are similar to standard double Hurwitz numbers. Intuitively, they count the num-
ber of branched d-coverings of the sphere by a possibly disconnected Riemann
suface of genus g , where two points have branching described by α and β, while
all other branch points have branching described by completed (r + 1)-cycles.
In particular, when r = 1, we recover the previous deﬁnition. A particular case
of these numbers occurs when one of the partitions, say α, is of length one, i.e.
g,(r )
α = (d). In this case, we call the numbers H
(d),β one-part double Hurwitz num-
bers with completed (r + 1)-cycles.

Actually, enumerating branched coverings is just one of the possible sources of Hur-
witz numbers. It is known that, equivalently, Hurwitz numbers enumerate permuta-
tions with some given properties, ribbon graphs (e.g. graphs on Riemann surfaces) and
tropical graphs (see again [LZ13; GJV05; KL15; CJM10] and references therein). In par-
ticular, the interpretation in terms of permutations leads to the combinatorial deﬁni-
tion of Hurwitz numbers in terms of irreducible characters of the symmetric groups.

In this paper, as it is done in [SSZ12], we study Hurwitz numbers starting from a
purely combinatorial deﬁnition. Our results are about one part double Hurwitz num-
bers with completed 3-cycles, and can be seen as a natural analogue of some very well
known results by Goulden, Jackson and Vakil about standard double Hurwitz numbers.
More speciﬁcally, let d ∈ N and α, β be two partitions of d. The disconnected double

where the sum is over all degree d branched covers of CP1 by a genus g possibly discon-
nected Riemann surface, with k+2 branch points, of which k := k
α,β = 2g−2+l(α)+l(β)
are simple, and two have branching given by α and β. The condition on k is a conse-
quence of the Riemann-Hurwitz theorem. Aut(Cov) means the ﬁnite automorphism

α,β by
If α = (d) then the
adding the requirement that the covering surface is connected.
connected and disconnected numbers are equal, in other words, there is no discon-
nected cover. The full description of the relation between connected and disconnected
numbers is contained in the chamber behavior and wall-crossing formula for Hurwitz
numbers [Joh15].

Goulden, Jackson and Vakil computed explicitly one-part double Hurwitz numbers

We postpone the deﬁnition of ci , ξ2λ and S2λ to the next section. The analogous

case) with completed 3-cycles, proved in this article, is as follows:

Let us mention that Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles were shown to have
surprising connection with relative Gromov-Witten invariants [OP06]. It is also conjec-
tured that there should be an ELSV-like formula for one-part double Hurwitz numbers
with completed cycles [SSZ12]. From this point of view, we believe that it is of a great
use to have an efﬁcient formula for computing these numbers.

To conclude, let us summarize some interesting results which are direct consequences

of the explicit formulae above. First, as it is in the case of standard double Hurwitz num-
g,(2)
bers, H
(d),β is polynomial in the parts of β, with the highest and lowest degrees being
respectively 3g + n−3
2 , where n = l(β). Note that the so-called strong piece-
wise polynomiality is proven in [SSZ12] for all double Hurwitz numbers with completed

2 and g + n−3

4

cycles. For one-part numbers, piece-wise polynomiality becomes polynomiality. Thus
our formula should be viewed as an illustration of this fact through an explicitly com-
putable case.

Second, single Hurwitz numbers are connected, through the celebrated ELSV for-
mula, to Hodge integrals on the Deligne–Mumford moduli space of stable curves with
marked points [Eke+01]. A similar connection between double Hurwitz numbers and
integrals of cohomological classes over a (yet to be deﬁned) moduli space is conjec-
tured in [GJV05] (see also [SSZ12] for a similar conjecture for double Hurwitz numbers
with completed cycles). Following what is done in [GJV05] to support their conjecture,
we deﬁned a sort of “combinatorial Hodge integrals” (equation (26)). Then we prove
that the lowest degree Hodge integrals satisfy a formula (Proposition 4.2) which is an
analogue of the λg -theorem by Faber and Pandharipande [FP03]. It is also an analogue
of [GJV05, Proposition 3.12].

Moreover, these lowest degree combinatorial Hodge integrals, satisfy a (modiﬁed)
version of the string and dilaton equations. Assembling them in a generating function
F , we prove that the string and dilaton equations correspond to two linear operators
L−1 and L0 annihilating F and satisfying a Virasoro-like relation. It would be of great
interest to prove that a whole set of Virasoro-like constraints can be obtained.
Finally, we prove some closed formula for combinatorial Witten terms, i.e. combi-

natorial Hodge integrals of top degree.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the combinatorial deﬁ-
nition of double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles. Afterwards, in section 3, we
state and prove our main result, theorem 1.2. The corollaries coming from the main
theorem are contained in the last section.

2 Double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles

We follow closely the exposition in [SSZ12] that gives a combinatorial deﬁtion of double
Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles.

2.1 Shifted symmetric functions

Let Q[x1,..., xd ] be the algebra of d-variable polynomials over Q. The shifted action
of the symmetric group Sd (the group of permutations on {1,..., d}) on this algebra is
deﬁned by:

σ( f (x1 − 1,..., xd − d)) := f (xσ(1) − σ(1),..., xσ(d) − σ(d))

(6)
for σ ∈ Sd and for any polynomial written in the variables xi−i. Denote by Q[x1,..., xd ]⋆
the sub-algebra of polynomials which are invariant with respect to this action.

Deﬁne the algebra of shifted symmetric functions as the projective limit

Λ⋆ := lim
←−

Q[x1,... , xd ]⋆,

where the projective limit is taken in the category of ﬁltered algebras with respect to
the homomorphism which sends the last variable to 0. Concretely, an element of this
algebra is a sequence f = { f (d)}d≥1, f (d) ∈ Q[x1,..., xd ]⋆ such that the polynomials f (d)
are of uniformly bounded degree and stable under the restriction f (d+1)|xd+1=0 = f (d).

2.2 Bases of the algebra of shifted symmetric functions

Deﬁnition 2.1. For any positive integer k, deﬁne the corresponding shifted symmetric
power sum:

pk(x1, x2,...) :=

∞Xi=1Ãµxi − i +

2¶k

−µ−i +

2¶k!.

(7)

In the following, we are only interested in evaluating these functions on partitions.
That is, for a partition λ = (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ....), we deﬁne pk(λ) := pk(λ1, λ2,...). As usual in
symmetric function theory, for any partition µ, deﬁne pµ = pµ1 pµ2 ...
The functions {pµ, µ ∈ Part} form a basis of Λ⋆. Another basis is deﬁned as follows.
For partitions λ and µ of d, let χλ
µ be the irreducible character of Sd associated with λ
evaluated at µ , dim λ = χλ
(1n ) be the dimension of the irreducible representation, and
Per(µ) be the set of permutations of Sn whose cycle structure is described by µ.

dim(λ)

.

(8)

Kerov and Olshanski [KO94] proved that:

Proposition 2.1. The functions { fµ, µ ∈ Part} are shifted symmetric functions, and form
a basis of Λ⋆.

2.3 Completed cycles

Let QSd be the group algebra of Sd over Q, i.e. the algebra of formal linear sum with
rational coefﬁcients of elements of Sd . Let Z QSd be the center of this algebra, which is
the subalgebra containing elements that commute with every element of QSd . Finally,
deﬁne

Z :=

∞Md=0

Z QSd .

It is well known that a basis of Z can be constructed as follows. For a partition µ, let

Cµ := Xg∈Per(µ)

g .

Then {Cµ, µ ∈ Part} form a basis of Z . Therefore we have the linear isomorphism

φ : Z → Λ⋆
Cµ 7→ fµ.

(9)

Deﬁnition 2.3. For any partition µ, the completed µ-conjugacy class C µ is deﬁned as

C µ := φ−1(pµ)/Q µi !. Of special interest are the completed cycles (r ) := C (r ), r = 1,2,...,

(r ) is the 1-part partition of r .

Some ﬁrst completed cycles are:

0!(1) = (1)
1!(2) = (2)

2.4 Double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles

From now on, we shall follow the notation of Goulden, Jackson and Vakil [GJV05], so
that the readers can compare our result with theirs easily. Let α and β be two partitions
of a same number d, whose lengths are m and n respectively. Let g , r and s be three
non-negative integers such that r s = 2g − 2+ m + n.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Disconnected double Hurwitz numbers with completed (r + 1)-cycles
are deﬁned as:

We often omit the superscript (r ) if it is ﬁxed in advance. Since the completed 2-
g,(1)
α,β are just the

cycle is equal to the ordinary 2-cycle, the double Hurwitz numbers H
ordinary double Hurwitz numbers.

We are mostly interested in the dependence of H

g,(r )
α,β on (the parts of) α and β, given
ﬁxed g , r, d, l(α) and l(β). The deﬁning formula does not give any immediate informa-
tion on this because the number of terms is great (the number of partitions of d in-
pd ), and the irreducible characters of large symmetric groups
creases essentially as e
are not easy to compute.

The numbers obtained in the case m = 1, i.e. α = (d) are called one-part double
numbers. In this case, the sum is simpliﬁed a lot, and we can get an explicit and com-
pact formula for r = 2.

2.5 Geometric and combinatorial interpretation

In [SSZ15, Section 2.2], the authors give a combinatorial interpretation of single Hur-
witz numbers with completed cycles. We can naturally generalize their construction for
double numbers as follows. Let α and β be two partitions of d. A (g, r, α, β)-factorization
fac(g , r, α, β) is a factorization in Sd of the following form:

h1 ... hs g1g2 = 1,

(11)

where r s = 2g −2+ l(α)+ l(β), g ∈ Z+, g1 ∈ Per(α), g2 ∈ Per(β), and each hi ∈ Sd appears
in (r + 1) with a coefﬁcient ci 6= 0. The weight of this factorization is deﬁned as

w(fac) :=

ci .

Proposition 2.2. We have the following equality:

fac ∈{(g,r,α,β)−factorizations}

w(fac) =

Proof. Since {Cλ|λ ⊢ d} form a basis of Z QSd , we can write:

s

CαCβ = a(1d ),

where the right hand side means the coefﬁcient of C(1d ) = Id ≡ 1 in the product follow-
ing it. Consider the left regular representation of QSd , i.e. the action of QSd on itself by
multiplication on the left. A main theorem of the representation theory of the symmet-
ric groups[LZ13, Theorem A.1.5] gives us the decomposition of this representation into
irreducible ones:

QSd =Mλ⊢d

dim(λ)Vλ.

Here dim(λ) is the dimension of the irreducible representation λ of Sd (as we deﬁned
in the section 2.2) and dimVλ = dim(λ). The action of an element B ∈ Z QSd in Vλ is
multiplication by a number Lλ(B), i.e. the matrix L(B) representing B is diagonal:

L(B) = diagλ⊢d

Double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles also have a beautiful geometric in-

α,β intuitively counts the number of "weighted" branched d-coverings
terpretation. H
of the sphere by a possibly disconnected Riemann suface of genus g , where two points
have branching described by α and β, while all other branch points have branching
described by completed (r + 1)-cycles. In fact, the precise geometric picture is more
delicate but not necessary for us in the sequel. We refer to [SSZ12, Section 2.5] for de-
tails.

Instead, still on the intuitive level, we explain what is happening to help the readers
who are not specialists. We invite the readers to the excellent book [LZ13], in particu-
lar Appendix A, where the following things are discussed in details. Let µ1,..., µ j be j
partitions of a natural number d. Denote by N
µ1,...,µ j the weighted number of not nec-
essarily connected degree d branched covers of CP1 by a Riemann surface of genus g
which have exactly j ﬁxed ramiﬁcation points, whose proﬁles are given by µ1,..., µ j .
The weight of a cover is the inverse of the order of its ﬁnite automorphism group. Note
that g is determined by µ1,..., µ j (and d) according to the Riemann-Hurwitz formula.
By an analysis of the monodromy of the covers, we can interpret this number in terms
of factorizations:

g

N

g

µ1,...,µ j = #©(g1,..., g j ) ∈ Per(µ1)× ...Per(µ j )|g1 ... g j = 1ª.

(2,1d−2)(λ),

where k is the number of simple branch points. Therefore, if we want to impose the
condition that the branching over points different from 0 and ∞ is given by completed
cycles, we need to replace the shifted symmetric function fµ by the shifted symmetric
power sum pµ, and hence have the deﬁnition 2.4.

3 Explicit formula for one-part double Hurwitz numbers

with completed 3-cycles

We consider the case r = 2. Let β be a partition of d of odd length n. Let s = g + n−1
write β in three ways, each of which is convenient in each speciﬁc context.

2 . We

¡β1, β2,...¢ =¡1n12n2 ...¢ =¡ℓnℓ ... q nq¢.

(14)

Here ℓ and q are the smallest and greatest numbers appearing in β. If a number i does

not appear in β, ni = 0. Let ci = ni for i ≥ 2 and c1 = n1 − 1. We havePi ci = n − 1 and
P i ci = d − 1.

We can easily compute that:

Remark. The fact that p3¡¡d − k,1k¢¢ has the form a(k + b)2 + c, where a, b, c do not
depend on k (but on d of course) turns out to be crucial for our method. Unfortunately,
pr+1((d −k,1k)) for r ≥ 3 do not have the form a(k +b)r +c , so we do not get a compact
formula by the same strategy.

4 Some corollaries

Our formula is explicit and computationally efﬁcient. We observe a strong similar-
ity with the case of ordinary one-part double Hurwitz numbers. Consequently, as in

14

[GJV05], we prove some fairly important implications.

4.1 Strong Polynomiality

Our formula gives immediately the strong polynomialty of 1-part double Hurwitz num-
bers with completed 3-cycles. In fact, double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles
of any size satisfy the strong piecewise polynomiality, i.e. they are piecewise polyno-
mial with the highest and lowest orders respectively (r + 1)s + 1− m − n and (r + 1)s +
1− m − n − 2g . This is proved in [SSZ12]. For one-part numbers, piecewise polynomial-
ity becomes polynomiality. Our formula should be viewed as an illustration of this fact
through an explicitly computable case.

g,(2)
(d),β, for ﬁxed g and n, is a polynomial of the parts of β and satisﬁes the
Corollary 4.1. H
strong polynomiality property, i.e. it is polynomial in β1, β2,... with highest and lowest
degrees respectively 3g + n−3

2 and g + n−3

2

The polynomial is divisible by d s−1, but unlike the case of ordinary double Hurwitz
(d),β/s!d s−1 depends on the number of parts of β for g ≥ 1. See the com-

numbers, 2s H
ment after [GJV05, Corollary 3.2].

4.2 Connection with intersection theory on moduli spaces of curves

and "the λg theorem"

g

β is deﬁned to be the weighted number of
The connected single Hurwitz number H
degree d branched covers of CP1 by a connected Riemann surface of genus g , with p+1
branch points, of which p are simple, and one has branching given by β. Due to the
Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we have p = 2g − 2+ d + n, where n = l(β). The celebrated
ELSV formula [Eke+01] connects these numbers with integrals on the moduli space of
stable curves:

M g,n is the moduli space of stable curves of genus g with n marked points. λi is a
certain codimension i class, and ψi is a certain codimension 1 class. The precise deﬁ-
nitions are not needed for us. The reader is invited to consult the original papers or the
very comprehensible book [LZ13].

In other words, P g¡β¢ := H

Another ELSV formula has been found for the so-called orbifold Hurwitz numbers, i.e
double Hurwitz numbers with α = (a, a,... , a) by Johnson, Pandharipande and Tseng
[JPT11]. It is an important and challenging problem to ﬁnd other ELSV formulas. An
important clue is the (piece-wise) polynomiality of Hurwitz numbers.

In [SSZ12], the authors conjecture that for every r ≥ 1, there exist moduli spaces X (r )
of complex dimension 2g (r + 1)+ n − 1 such that we have the following ELSV formula:

where we ﬁx the degrees of the rational cohomology classes Λ2k ∈ H 4r k³X (r )
H 2r³X (r )
g,n´.
A similar conjecture was previously made by Goulden, Jackson and Vakil [GJV05] for
ordinary double Hurwitz numbers, i.e. the case r = 1. To support their conjecture, they
made a thorough combinatorial study and found many similarity between "combina-
torial Hodge integrals" and the "real" ones deﬁned by (24) .

g,n´ and Ψi ∈

Following them, let us deﬁne the combinatorial Hodge integrals for b1,..., bn ≥ 0 and

0 ≤ k ≤ g :

(26)

We use the double brackets just to remind the readers that the conjectural moduli space
has not been found, and do not keep the superscript (2) to save space. This "intersec-
tion" number vanishes unless b1 + ...+ bn + 2k = 3g + n−1
2 . The order of this integral is
deﬁned to be b1 + ...+ bn.
We are going to evaluate the lowest order terms, i.e. the terms with k = g . In [FP03],
Faber and Pandharipande proved the so-called λg conjecture (which is also a conse-
quence of the unresolved Virasoro conjecture):

〈τb1 ... τbn λg〉g = cgÃ2g − 3+ n
b1,..., bn!.

16

(27)

By computing 〈τ2g−2λg〉g , they found

22g−1 − 1
22g−1(2g )!|B2g|,

cg =

where B2g is a Bernoulli number (B0 = 1, B2 = 1/6, B4 = −1/30, B6 = 1/42,...). In analogy
with this theorem, the following combinatorial version is proved in [GJV05, Proposition
3.12]:

〈〈τb1 ... τbn

Λ2g〉〉r=1

g = cgÃ2g − 3+ n
b1,..., bn!.

Their symbol 〈〈.〉〉r=1
is deﬁned just like (26), with a different normalisation [GJV05,
Eq.25]. It is quite remarkable that the same constant cg appears. However, the most
interesting thing about these two formulas is the multinomial coefﬁcient.

Proof. First, we extract the lowest term in the polynomial d H

ply taking only the h = 0 term in the sum (5), and then taking the constant term of S2λ,
which is (−1)l (λ), in the sum over all partitions λ of g . The result is:

We observe a strong similarity with the results quoted above. The main difference
is the dependence on n of the factor Cg,n. A geometric explanation would be of great
interest.

4.3 Dilaton and string equations

Goulden, Jackson and Vakil proved that their combinatorial Hodge integrals for ordi-
nary double Hurwitz numbers satisfy the string and dilation equations [GJV05, Propo-
sition 3.10]. Here we prove that the lowest terms satisfy the (modiﬁed) string and dilaton
equations for every genus g . The situation for higher terms are not clear to us.

It is easy to check that [L0, L−1] = L−1. They look like two lowest Virasoro constraints. It
would be interesting to investigate if we have higher Virasoro-like constraints as well.
And of course, it would be of great interest to investigate string and dilaton equations
for higher order integrals, i.e. for Λ2k with k < g .
