THE BASILICA THOMPSON GROUP IS NOT FINITELY PRESENTED

STEFAN WITZEL AND MATTHEW C. B. ZAREMSKY

Abstract. We show that the Basilica Thompson group introduced by Belk and Forrest
is not ﬁnitely presented, and in fact is not of type FP2. The proof involves developing
techniques for proving non-simple connectedness of certain subcomplexes of CAT(0) cube
complexes.

Introduction

J. Belk and B. Forrest [BF15a] introduced the Basilica Thompson group TB (deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 1.10 below). They showed that it is virtually simple, generated by four elements,
and is a sub- as well as a supergroup of Thompson’s group T . The question of whether it
is ﬁnitely presented, however, remained open. In this paper we prove:

Theorem. TB is not ﬁnitely presented.

The Basilica Thompson group is an example of a rearrangement group of a fractal as deﬁned
by Belk and Forrest in [BF15b]. These groups arise from edge replacement systems and act
naturally on self-similar spaces, for example Julia sets. They generalize Thompson’s groups
F , T and V . For certain rearrangement groups Belk and Forrest proved that they are of
type F∞, conﬁrming the “expected” behavior for relatives of Thompson’s groups. As for
the classical Thompson’s groups, the proof relies on studying the action on an associated
CAT(0) cube complex. The reason that (non-)ﬁnite presentability of TB remained open
is that the known local methods are not suited to prove the kind of negative connectivity
statement needed. Our proof of the theorem involves a global analysis.

We now know of (virtually) simple rearrangement groups with two extremal ﬁniteness
properties: of type F1 but not of type F2, and of type F∞. If the intermediate ﬁniteness
properties could also be achieved, e.g. of type Fn but not Fn+1 for any n, this would
provide an inﬁnite family of pairwise non-quasi-isometric simple groups (the only other
known examples of this kind are hyperbolic Kac–Moody groups [CR09]). We therefore
ask:

Question. Is there a rearrangement group that is virtually simple, ﬁnitely presented, but
not of type F∞?

1. Background

In this section we recall the necessary background material from Sections 1, 2 and 3 of
[BF15b] on edge replacement systems, and the resulting groups and complexes. At the end
we also recall some background on discrete Morse theory, and on CAT(0) cube complexes.

1.1. Edge replacement systems. We will consider ﬁnite directed graphs G. The nota-
tion V (G) and E(G) will always mean the vertex and edges sets of G.

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Edge replacement rule). An (edge) replacement rule is a pair e → R, for
e a non-loop directed edge, say with initial vertex v and terminal vertex w, and R a ﬁnite
directed graph with v, w ∈ V (R).

Deﬁnition 1.2 (Edge replacement system). An (edge) replacement system is a pair (G0, e →
R), for G0 a ﬁnite directed graph, called the base graph, and e → R a replacement rule.
We will always assume (G0, e → R) is expanding (see [BF15b, Deﬁnition 1.8]), i.e. G0 has
no isolated vertices, v and w do not share an edge in R, and |V (R)| ≥ 3 and |E(R)| ≥ 2.

Applying a replacement rule to the edge ε ∈ E(G) of a graph G amounts to removing
the edge ε and replacing it by R. Note that we do allow ε to be a loop. We denote
by G ⊳ ε the graph obtained from G by replacing the edge ε by R in this way. We call
G ⊳ ε a simple expansion of G. Any graph obtained from G by a ﬁnite sequence of simple
expansions is called an expansion of G. The reverse of a (simple) expansion is called a
(simple) contraction. We will “address” edges and vertices of expansions by concatenating
addresses of edges and vertices from G and R; for example, if the edges of R are called
1, 2, 3 then the new edges in the expansion G ⊳ ε are called ε1, ε2, ε3, and the old edges
retain their addresses from G. See Example 1.9 for pictures.

Deﬁnition 1.3 (Limit space). Let R = (G0, e → R) be an edge replacement system. For
each n ∈ N let Gn be the result of applying the replacement rule to each edge of Gn−1 once.
Let Ω := E(G0) × E(R)∞ be the set of sequences of edges, with leading edge from G0 and
all others from R. Declare that two such sequences ε0ε1 · · · and ε′
1 · · · are equivalent if
for all n the edges of Gn with “addresses” ε0 · · · εn and ε′
n share a vertex. Deﬁne the
limit space X for R to be the space of equivalence classes [ε0ε1 · · · ] of such sequences.

0 · · · ε′

0ε′

The limit space X of a replacement system R is compact and metrizable ([BF15b, The-
orem 1.24]). Our groups of interest are certain groups of homeomorphisms of such limit
spaces, which is the subject of the next subsection.

1.2. Rearrangement groups. We now deﬁne rearrangement groups, which are certain
groups of homeomorphisms of limit spaces.

Deﬁnition 1.4 (Cell). Let X be the limit space of a replacement system R = (G0, e → R).
Let ε = ε0 · · · εn be an edge of some expansion of G0. The cell C(ε) ⊆ X is the subspace
consisting of equivalence classes of sequences representable by a sequence with ε0 · · · εn as
a preﬁx.

Deﬁnition 1.5 (Canonical homeomorphism). Let C(ε) and C(ε′) be two cells such that ε
and ε′ are either both loops or both non-loops. The canonical homeomorphism Φ : C(ε) →
C(ε′) is the map deﬁned via the preﬁx replacement rule

Φ([εζ1ζ2 · · · ]) := [ε′ζ1ζ2 · · · ].

Deﬁnition 1.6 (Rearrangement). Let X be the limit space of a replacement system R =
(G0, e → R). A homeomorphism f : X → X is called a rearrangement if there exist ﬁnitely
many cells C(ε1), . . . , C(εn) such that the cells cover X, have pairwise disjoint interiors
(deﬁned in [BF15b, Section 1.3]), and such that each restriction f |C(εi) is a canonical
homeomorphism.

Deﬁnition 1.7 (Rearrangement group). The rearrangements of X form a group [BF15b,
Proposition 1.15], called the rearrangement group Γ of X.

Deﬁnition 1.8 (Graph pair diagram). Let f : X → X be a rearrangement. A graph pair
diagram for f is a triple (E−, E+, ϕ), where E± are expansions of G0 and ϕ : E− → E+
is a graph isomorphism, such that for every edge ε of E− the restriction of f to C(ε) is
a canonical homeomorphism from C(ε) to C(ϕ(ε)). The idea is that, even though f is a
homeomorphism of X, it can already be realized at some ﬁnite expansion stage. In a graph
pair diagram (E−, E+, ϕ), we call E− the domain graph and E+ the range graph.

are expansions of G0, with the addresses given for the edges and vertices. For X the limit

is a rearrangement. The graph pair diagram for this map consists of the above graphs,
with the isomorphism ϕ given by erasing the “∗”’s in these canonical homeomorphisms.

Deﬁnition 1.10. The Basilica Thompson group TB is the rearrangement group of the
rewriting system in Example 1.9.

1.3. Cube complexes for rearrangement groups. In this subsection, we recall the
CAT(0) cube complex on which a rearrangement group Γ acts. The replacement rule
e → R will be ﬁxed throughout. Given a base graph G0, we will denote the cube complex
by K(G0, e → R). In [BF15b] it was denoted K(Γ), but for our purposes it is important to
keep track of the base graph G0 used, and less important to keep track of the group Γ. For
any choice of base graph G0, denote by X(G0) the limit space of the replacement system
(G0, e → R). We extend the deﬁnition of rearrangement from Deﬁnition 1.6 as follows:

Deﬁnition 1.11 (Rearrangement). Let G0 and G be two choices of base graph, so we
have limit spaces X(G0) and X(G). A homeomorphism f : X(G0) → X(G) is called a
rearrangement if there exist ﬁnitely many cells C(ε1), . . . , C(εn) such that the cells cover
X(G0), have pairwise disjoint interiors, and such that each restriction f |C(εi) is a canonical
homeomorphism.

The category whose objects are the X(G) and whose morphisms are rearrangements is a
groupoid. Note that depending on the choices of G0 and G, a rearrangement X(G0) →
X(G) might not exist, thus the groupoid is not connected.

We can also extend the deﬁnition of graph pair diagram from Deﬁnition 1.8:

Deﬁnition 1.12 (Graph pair diagram). Let f : X(G0) → X(G) be a rearrangement. A
graph pair diagram for f is a triple (E−, E+, ϕ) where E− is an expansion of G0, E+ is an
expansion of G and ϕ : E− → E+ is a graph isomorphism, such that for every edge ε of E−
the restriction of f to C(ε) is a canonical homeomorphism from C(ε) to C(ϕ(ε)).

Rearrangements can be decomposed into certain fundamental rearrangements.

Deﬁnition 1.13 (Special rearrangements). If G is an expansion of G0, there is a canon-
ical rearrangement ϕ : X(G0) → X(G) with diagram (G, G, id). We call it an expansion
rearrangement. Its inverse is a contraction rearrangement. If the expansion was simple, we
also say that the expansion/contraction rearrangement is simple. If ϕ : G0 → G is a graph
isomorphism then the diagram (G0, G, ϕ) represents a rearrangement X(G0) → X(G), also
denoted ϕ, which is called a base isomorphism.

Thus any rearrangement is a product of an expansion rearrangement, a base isomorphism,
and a contraction rearrangement.

We are now approaching the deﬁnition of the cube complex K(G0, e → R). The funda-
mental objects here are rearrangements with a ﬁxed domain X(G0).

Deﬁnition 1.14 (Range equivalence, expansion/contraction). Let f : X(G0) → X(G1)
and g : X(G0) → X(G2) be two arrangements. We say that f and g are range equivalent
if there is a base isomorphism ϕ : X(G1) → X(G2) such that ϕ ◦ f = g. We write [f ] for
the range equivalence class of f . We say that g is a (simple) expansion of f if there is a
(simple) expansion rearrangement ϕ : X(G1) → X(G2) such that ϕ ◦ f = g. In that case f
is a (simple) contraction of g. We also apply these notions to [f ] and [g]. In special cases
we will need notation for this. If S = {ε1, . . . , εk} ⊆ E(G1) is the set of edges of G1 such

6

S. WITZEL AND M. C. B. ZAREMSKY

G2 = G1 ⊳ ε1 ⊳ . . . εk (the order does not matter) then we write ϕ = ∆S. Conversely if
T = {R1, . . . , Rk} are the replacements for the εi then we write ϕ−1 = ∇T . If such an S
or T has only one element, we may omit the set braces from the notation, and so write
things like ∆ε and ∇R. In that case we may specify the subgraph R of G2 by listing its
edges, writing for example ∇ε1,ε2,ε3.

Deﬁnition 1.15 (The cube complex). Let K(G0, e → R) be the cube complex deﬁned
as follows. There is a 0-cube for every range equivalence class [f ] of rearrangements with
domain X(G0). For each 0-cube [f ], say represented by the rearrangement f : X(G0) →
X(G), and for each S ⊆ E(G), there is an |S|-dimensional cube whose 0-subcube set is
{[∆T ◦ f ] | T ⊆ S}.

For example, if f : X(G0) → X(G) is a rearrangement and ε is an edge of G then [f ] and
[∆ε ◦ f ] span a 1-cube. Belk and Forrest proved that K(G0, e → R) is a CAT(0) cube
complex:

Proposition 1.16 ([BF15b, Proposition 3.33, Corollary 3.24]). The complex K(G0, e →
R) is contractible, and in fact is CAT(0).

Deﬁnition 1.17 (Rank). The rank of a rearrangement f : X(G0) → X(G) is µ(f ) :=
|E(G)|. Since range equivalent rearrangements have the same rank, we can also deﬁne the
rank of an equivalence class µ([f ]) := µ(f ).

It is easy to see (and explained in [BF15b]) that µ extends to a Morse function on the cube
complex K(G0, e → R) (for any graph G0 and replacement system e → R). We review the
relevant Morse theoretic concepts in the next subsection.

1.4. Morse theory.

Deﬁnition 1.18 (Morse function). Let X be a cube complex and let h : X → R be a map.
We call h a Morse function if the following properties hold:

(i) The image h(X (0)) is discrete in R.
(ii) For any cube c, the restriction of h to c is an aﬃne function h|c : c → R.
(iii) For any cube c of positive dimension, the restriction of h to c is non-constant.

Here when we say that h|c : c → R is an aﬃne function, we are viewing c as [−1, 1]dim(c)
with the usual aﬃne structure.

Given a cube complex X with a Morse function h, for any m ∈ R we denote by Xm the
subcomplex of X supported on those 0-cubes x with h(x) ≤ m. The descending link lk↓x
of a 0-cube x is the link of x in the sublevel set Xh(x). That is, the descending link is the
subcomplex of the link lk x supported on those 0-simplices along which h is decreasing.
Our Morse Lemma (which is a special case of [BB97, Corollary 2.6]) is as follows:

Lemma 1.19 (Morse Lemma). Let X be a cube complex and h : X → R a Morse function.
Suppose m ≤ M are real numbers, and that for all 0-cubes x ∈ X (0) with m < h(x) ≤ M

THE BASILICA THOMPSON GROUP IS NOT FINITELY PRESENTED

7

the descending link lk↓x is (n − 1)-acyclic. Then the inclusion Xm → XM induces an
isomorphism in Hk for k ≤ n − 1, and an epimorphism in Hn.

The connection between Morse theory and ﬁnite presentability is made as follows. First
recall that if a group is ﬁnitely presented then it satisﬁes the homological ﬁniteness property
of being of type FP2. To show that TB is not of type FP2 we will use the following criterion.

Lemma 1.20. Let a group Γ act with ﬁnite stabilizers on a 1-acyclic cube complex X.
Let h : X → R be a Morse function on X, and suppose that each Xm is Γ-invariant and
cocompact. Suppose there exists N ∈ N such that for any x ∈ X (0) with h(x) > N, the
descending link of x is connected. Then Γ is of type FP2 if and only if Xm is 1-acyclic for
some m ≥ N.

Proof. If some Xm is 1-acyclic then it is of type FP2 by [Bro87, Proposition 1.1].
In
the converse direction, the Morse Lemma implies that the maps H1(XN → Xm) are all
surjective for m ≥ N. Thus if Xm is not 1-acyclic for any m, then the map H1(Xn → Xm)
cannot be trivial for any N ≤ n ≤ m (since the previous map is surjective and factors
through this one). Hence the system H1(Xn), n ≥ N is not essentially trivial, and [Bro87,
Theorem 2.2] implies that G is not of type FP2.
(cid:3)

We close the section with a strengthening of the well known nerve lemma. We will only
need the case n = 1, where it is a homological version of [WZ15, Lemma 6.2], but having
the question from the introduction in mind, we prove the general case. The main point is
the surjective morphism at the end of the statement.

Proposition 1.21 (Strong nerve lemma). Let a CW complex X be covered by subcomplexes
(Xi)i∈I, let L be the nerve of the cover and let n ∈ N be arbitrary. Assume that if Xi1 ∩
. . . ∩ Xir 6= ∅ then

for 1 ≤ r ≤ n − q. Then Hk(X) ∼= Hk(L) for k < n and there is a surjective morphism
Hn(X) → Hn(L).

Hq(Xi1 ∩ . . . ∩ Xir ) = Hq(pt.)

Proof. The nerve is the simplicial complex of those T ⊆ I with XT := Ti∈T Xi 6= ∅. It

is equipped with the coeﬃcient systems hq : T → Hq(XT ). We use the spectral sequence
from [Dav08, Theorem E.3.2]:

E2

p,q = Hp(L; hq) ⇒ H∗(X).

Our conditions ensure that hq(T ) = 0 provided T has dimension at most n − q − 1 for
q > 0. This means that

(1.1)

p,q = (cid:26) Hp(L; h0) q = 0 and 0 ≤ p ≤ n

1 ≤ q ≤ n − p − 1.

E2

0

Since the spectral sequence lies in the ﬁrst quadrant, the region p + q ≤ n − 1 of (1.1)
remains stable, which tells us that Hp(X) ∼= Hp(L; h0) for 0 ≤ p ≤ n − 1 and that there is
an epimorphism Hn(X) → Hn(L; h0).

∼= LT ∈Σp

Thus it remains to show that Hp(L; h0) ∼= Hp(L) for 0 ≤ p ≤ n − 1 and to produce an
epimorphism Hn(L; h0) → Hn(L). We claim that the map of coeﬃcient systems h0 → Z
(here the codomain is the coeﬃcient system that is constant Z) induced by contracting
all XT to a point works. To spell this out let (Cp)p∈N be the chain complex of L, i.e.
Z where Σp is the set of p-simplices of L. We think of the generator of the
Cp
summand corresponding to T as XT . Let ˜Cp be the chain complex of L with coeﬃcients in
h0, i.e. ˜Cp
H0(XT ). Our assumptions ensure that H0(XT ) = Z for T of dimension
at most n−1, so we can identify Cp with ˜Cp for p ≤ n−1. It follows that Hp(L) ∼= Hp(L; h0)
∂→ Cn−1 are
for p ≤ n − 2. It is also easy to see that the images of Cn
the same so Hn−1(L) ∼= Hn−1(L; h0).
In general (to cover degree n), we look at the map of chain complexes ψ∗ : ˜C∗ → C∗ taking
each component of XT to XT . The key point is that this is actually a map of chain
complexes, in particular that the square

∼= LT ∈Σp

∂→ Cn−1 and of ˜Cn

˜Cn+1

commutes. This comes from the fact that if f : XU → XT is continuous (inclusion in our
case) then the diagram

commutes. The rest is easy: any c ∈ Cn is the image under ψn of some ˜c ∈ ˜Cn and if
˜c = ∂ ˜d then c = ∂ψn+1( ˜d) =: ∂d. Thus ψ∗ induces an epimorphism in degree n.
(cid:3)

Corollary 1.22. Let a CW complex X be covered by connected subcomplexes. If the nerve
of the cover is not 1-acyclic then neither is X.
(cid:3)

1.5. CAT(0) cube complexes. In this brief subsection we collect some terminology and
results regarding CAT(0) cube complexes, all of which comes for example from [HW08].
Let X be a CAT(0) cube complex. A midcube is the subset of [−1, 1]n obtained by re-
stricting some coordinate to 0. The midcubes of X form a new cube complex and each of
its components is a hyperplane in X. Each hyperplane is naturally embedded in X. A wall
of X is a parallel class of oriented 1-cubes of X. We will also use the term wall to denote

THE BASILICA THOMPSON GROUP IS NOT FINITELY PRESENTED

9

the cube complex whose 0-cubes are those 1-cubes, whose 1-cubes are the corresponding
2-cubes of X, and so forth. There is a natural 2-to-1 correspondence between walls and
hyperplanes and each wall is isomorphic to its corresponding hyperplane. If c is a cube
and H is a wall containing a 1-face of c we say that H cuts through c. The 1-faces of a
k-cube lie in precisely k walls. Given a hyperplane H, any subcomplex of X supported on
all the 0-cubes in a connected component of X \ H is called a half-space. In fact each wall
H determines two half-spaces and we denote them H + and H −.

2. Proof

In this section we prove our main result, that the Basilica Thompson group TB is not
ﬁnitely presented. The main technical lemma that is speciﬁc to the Basilica rewriting
system is Lemma 2.4. The Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7 should readily generalize to other setups.
The rest of the section is general combinatorial topology which is conveniently phrased in
the setup of cube complexes.

Remark 2.1. We think that it would only take minor modiﬁcations (mostly to Lemma 2.4)
to prove that, for example, the rearrangement groups for the rabbit Julia set and its
variants are not ﬁnitely presented (see [BF15b] for background). Thus a positive answer
to the question posed initially will not come from Julia sets whose parameter is in a bulb
of the Mandelbrot set adjacent to the main cardioid.

Using Lemma 1.20 our main task is to show that certain sublevel sets are not 1-acyclic.
For that purpose we will use the following criterion.

Lemma 2.2. Let X be a CAT(0) cube complex, let Y be a subcomplex, and let H1, H2
be two walls in X. Assume that H δ
2 ∩ Y are connected for δ ∈ {+, −}, that
H δ1
2 ∩ Y are all non-empty for δ1, δ2 ∈ {+, −}, and that H1 ∩ H2 ∩ Y is empty. Then
Y is not 1-acyclic.

1 ∩ Y and H δ

1 ∩ H δ2

Proof. The assumption that H1 ∩ H2 ∩ Y is empty means that Y contains no cube through
which H1 and H2 both cut, which implies that Y is covered by the subcomplexes H δ
i ∩ Y ,
for i ∈ {1, 2} and δ ∈ {+, −}. The nerve of this cover is S0 ∗ S0 ∼= S1, by the assumption
that the H δ1
i ∩ Y is
connected, and since the nerve is not 1-acyclic, the result follows from Corollary 1.22. (cid:3)

2 ∩ Y are all non-empty. Since we are also assuming that each H δ

Now consider the cube complex K(G0, e → R), for G0 the graph in Figure 1 and e → R the
Basilica replacement rule from Example 1.9. For the rest of this section, we will always be
using this rewriting rule, so we omit it from the notation. Let h : K(G0) → R be the Morse
function induced by the rank. To prove that TB is not of type FP2, Lemma 1.20 says it
suﬃces to show that for m large enough, no K(G0)m is 1-acylic. We will apply Lemma 2.2,
namely, we will ﬁnd two walls in K(G0) satisfying the requirements for Y = K(G0)m.
First we claim that walls in K(G0) are isomorphic to cube complexes of the form K(G),
for appropriate G.

Lemma 2.3 (Modeling walls). Let G1 be a graph, let ε an edge of G1, and let G2 = G1 ⊳ ε.
Let f : X(G0) → X(G1) and g = ∆ε ◦ f : X(G0) → X(G2) be rearrangements, and let c
be the 1-cube spanned by [f ] and [g]. Then the wall of c is isomorphic to the complex
K(G1 \ ε).

Proof. Let H be the wall of c in K(G0), so the 0-cubes of H are the 1-cubes of K(G0)
parallel to c. Let d be a such a 1-cube of H. Say d has 0-faces [f ′] and [g′], with g′ = ∆ε ◦f ′.
Since d is parallel to c, we know that f ′ = φ◦f for some rearrangement φ : X(G1) → X(G′),
and that φ is a composition of expansions and contractions that never involve the edge ε.
Now, with all the above data for 0-cubes d in H, deﬁne a map Ψ : H (0) → K(G1 \ ε)(0) by

Ψ(d) := [φ|K(G1\ε)].

Here φ|K(G1\ε) is, as the notation implies, the restriction of φ to a rearrangement X(G1 \
ε) → X(G′ \ε). This is well deﬁned since φ is a composition of expansions and contractions
that never involve ε. It is easily seen that Ψ is bijective, and that it extends to a cubical
isomorphism Ψ : H → K(G1 \ ε).
(cid:3)

Our speciﬁc walls of interest arise as follows. Consider the family of graphs Jn with n + 5
vertices and 2n + 10 edges indicated in Figure 2.

Fix a vertex [fn] of K(G0) represented by a rearrangement X(G0) → X(Jn). These exist
because Jn is an expansion of G0. Let cn be the 2-cube whose 0-faces are [fn], [∇c,d,e ◦ fn],
[∇x,y,z ◦ fn] and [∇c,d,e ◦ ∇x,y,z ◦ fn]. Let H1 be the hyperplane that cuts through the 1-cube
from [fn] to [∇x,y,z ◦ fn] and H2 the hyperplane that cuts through the 1-cube from xn to
[∇c,d,e ◦ fn]. For i = 1, 2, let H +
i be the
half-spaces that do not contain [fn].
By Lemma 2.3, the intersection H1 ∩ H2 is isomorphic to K(On), where On is the graph
given in Figure 3.

i be the half-spaces containing [fn] and let H −

The following is our key technical lemma, and is the result that is most speciﬁc to the case
of the Basilica rewriting system.

Lemma 2.4 (Key technical lemma). Let n ∈ N be arbitrary. Let On be the graph on n + 3
vertices and 2n + 4 edges indicated in Figure 3. Then the sublevel complex K(On)2n+3 is
empty.

have E − (2n + 4) = 2(V − (n + 3)). Thus we must equivalently show that any relevant
graph has at least n + 3 vertices. Note further that in a relevant graph all edges lie in the
boundary of the outer region, so they inherit a cyclic ordering. We call a path e1, . . . , ek
in a relevant graph ordered if the edges are successive in the cyclic order.

We say that a non-constant ordered closed path in a relevant graph G is a special circuit
if it only meets vertices of degree 4. We call a vertex v of such a graph collapsible if it is
of degree 4 and there is a special circuit connecting v to itself. We see that On has zero
collapsible vertices. Intuitively, if v is a collapsible vertex then after repeated contractions
it can be made to disappear.

Let G be a relevant graph, let ε be an edge of G and let G ⊳ ε be the corresponding simple
expansion. Then the new vertex of G ⊳ ε is collapsible: the special circuit in question is
just the new loop, ε2. Any vertex of G that is collapsible is still collapsible in G ⊳ ε: a
special circuit in G that uses ε can be turned into a special circuit in G⊳e by replacing ε by
ε1, ε2, ε3. Finally, if a vertex v of G is not collapsible, then it does not become collapsible
in G ⊳ ε: indeed, a special circuit in G ⊳ ε at v that uses one of ε1, ε2 or ε3 has to use all
of them, so replacing the sequence ε1, ε2, ε3 by ε gives rise to a special circuit in G.

The result of this discussion is that the number of collapsible vertices minus the number
of vertices is invariant under arbitrary expansions and contractions. Since the number of
collapsible vertices cannot become negative, we conclude that any graph obtained from On
via expansions and contractions has to have at least n + 4 vertices.

Let Yn := K(G0)2n+9. We will now verify that for n suﬃciently large, all the hypotheses
of Lemma 2.2 hold, with Yn playing the role of Y and H1 and H2 being our two walls.

Corollary 2.5 (Empty middle). The intersection H1 ∩ H2 ∩ Yn is empty.

Proof. By Lemma 2.3 the intersection H1 ∩ H2 is isomorphic to K(On), and H1 ∩ H2 ∩ Yn
is isomorphic to K(On)2n+3 since a point in K(On) with rank r corresponds to a 2-cube of
H1 ∩ H2 with maximum rank r + 6. By Lemma 2.4 K(On)2n+3 is empty.

Proof. The vertices [∇a,b,c ◦ ∇v,w,x ◦ fn], [∇c,d,e ◦ ∇v,w,x ◦ fn], [∇a,b,c ◦ ∇x,y,z ◦ fn] and [∇c,d,e ◦
∇x,y,z ◦fn] respectively lie in H +
2 ∩Yn,
and each of these vertices has rank 2n + 6, so lies in Yn.

Lemma 2.7 (Connected half-spaces). Let n ∈ N. For i ∈ {1, 2} and δ ∈ {+, −}, we have
that H δ

i ∩ Yn is connected.

Proof. We know from [BF15b, Example 4.5] that the only 0-cubes x ∈ H δ
i with discon-
nected descending link have at most 4 vertices. Thus if h(x) > 2n + 9 the descending
link in K(G0) is connected. Now H −
is contractible (being convex) and for every vertex
i
x ∈ H −
is the same as the descending link in K(G0). So the

Morse argument shows that H −

edge path from x1 to x2 in H +
1 . Our goal is to perturb it to lie in Yn. For that purpose it
suﬃces to show that given 0-cubes x, y, z ∈ H +
1 with x adjacent to y and z, h(x) > 2n + 9,
and h(y), h(z) < h(x) there exists a path from y to z using only vertices of height at most
h(x) − 1. Let x = [f ] where f is a rearrangement X(G0) → X(G) and let A and B be
the (3-edge) subgraphs of G such that y = [∇A ◦ f ] and z = [∇B ◦ f ]. There is a path
from y to z in the descending link of x in K(G0), but we need to deal with the fact that
the descending link in H +
1 may be smaller. We only need to treat the case where this
actually happens, i.e. where some 1-simplex over x lies in H1. Say the neighbor of x in H −
1
is x′ = [∇Z ◦ f ] for a subgraph Z. Moreover, if the path from y to z in the descending link
does not pass through x′, we are again done, so we can assume that it does pass through
x′ and, in fact, that y and z are both adjacent to x′. In terms of graphs this means that
A and B both are edge-disjoint from Z but A and B have an edge in common.

let A′ be the image of A after contracting B and let
We need some further notation:
B′ be the image of B after contracting A. We informally describe the strategy before
giving the technical details. The problem is that the path y = [∇Af ], [∇Z∇Af ], x′ =
[∇Zf ], [∇Z∇Bf ], z = [∇Bf ] is not available because it does not lie in H +
1 . So rather than
contracting Z we would like to ﬁrst split an edge ε of Z and then contract twice (preventing
us from crossing H1). The problem with this is that h([∆ε∇Af ]) = h(x). So before we can
do that we need to contract B′ as well.

To make this formal, we need even more notation: say Z has edges γ, δ, ε in that order.
So splitting ε in Z gives rise to a graph Z ⊳ ε with edges γ, δ, ε1, ε2 and ε3 of which δ
and ε2 are loops. We denote by Z ′ the subgraph with edges γ, δ, ε1 and by Z ′′ the result

of contracting Z ′ in Z ⊳ ε. Then the vertices [∆εf ], [∇Z ′∆εf ], [∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ] all lie in H +
1 ,
but h([∆εf ]) = h(x) + 1.

Finally, here is the path from y to z that does not cross H1 and only passes through vertices
of height < h(x). From y it moves down to [∇B ′∇Af ] of height h(x)−2. From there it moves
through [∆ε∇B ′∇Af ], [∇Z ′∆ε∇B ′∇Af ] to [∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆ε∇B ′∇Af ] = [∇B ′∇A∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ] of
height h(x)−3. At this point it can “untwist” A and B by moving through [∇A∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ]
to [∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ] (of height h(x)−1) and on to [∇B∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ] and [∇A′∇B∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆εf ] =
[∇Z ′′∇Z ′∆ε∇A′∇Bf ]. Now proceeding symmetrically it passes through [∇Z ′∆ε∇A′∇Bf ],
[∆ε∇A′∇Bf ], [∇A′∇Bf ] to z = [∇Bf ].

We can now prove a strengthening of our main result.

Theorem 2.8. TB is not of type FP2, and hence is not ﬁnitely presented.

Proof. Using Lemma 1.20 it suﬃces to show that Yn is not 1-acyclic for arbitrarily large n.
This follows from Lemma 2.2 the hypotheses of which have been veriﬁed in Corollary 2.5
and Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7.
