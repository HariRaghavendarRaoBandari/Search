Abstract. Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V (G). A subset S of V (G)
is independent if no two vertices from S are adjacent. The graph G is known to
be a Konig-Egervary (KE in short) graph if α(G)+µ(G) = |V (G)|, where α(G)
denotes the size of a maximum independent set and µ(G) is the cardinality of a
maximum matching. Let Ω(G) denote the family of all maximum independent
sets.

A collection F of sets is an hke collection if | S Γ| + | T Γ| = 2α holds for
every subcollection Γ of F . We characterize an hke collection and invoke new
characterizations of a KE graph.

We prove the existence and uniqueness of a graph G such that Ω(G) is a
maximal hke collection. It is a bipartite graph. As a result, we solve a problem
of Jarden, Levit and Mandrescu [4], proving that F is an hke collection if and
only if it is a subset of Ω(G) for some graph G and | S F | + | T F | = 2α(F ).

Finally, we show that the maximal cardinality of an hke collection F with

α(F ) = α and | S F | = n is 2n−α.

1. Introduction

In this paper we study hereditary KE collections: collections of sets, F , of a

ﬁxed cardinality α, such that the equality

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = 2α

holds for every non-empty subset Γ of F .

The following theorem is a restatement of [2, Theorem 2.6]:

Theorem 1.1. G is a KE graph if and only if for some hke subcollection Γ of Ω(G)
there is a matching M : V (G) − S Γ → T Γ.

In most of the sections of this paper, the main issue is the hke collections rather
than graphs. In Section 2, we present characterizations for an hke collection and
invoke a new characterization for a KE graph. Deﬁnition 2.7 presents the typical
example of a maximal hke collection. Theorem 3.12 characterize a maximal hke
collection by its cardinality. By Corollary 4.10, the typical example for α (that is
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.7) is the unique maximal hke collection, where α is given.
By Theorem 5.11, there is a unique KE graph (actually, a bipartite graph), G,
such that Ω(G) is a maximal hke collection. By Theorem 6.3, a collection of sets
F is an hke collection if and only if it is included in Ω(G) for some graph G and
|S F | + |T F | = 2α(F ). By Theorem 7.6, the maximal cardinality of an hke
collection, F , with α(F ) = α and |S F | = n is 2n−α.

2. Konig Egervary Collections

In this section, we deﬁne a relevant collection, a KE collection and an hke col-
lection. We charecterize hke collections and invoke new characterizations for a KE
graph.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A relevant collection is a ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite sets such that
the number of elements in each set in F is a constant positive integer, denoted
α(F ). When F is clear from the context, we omit it, writting α.

The following deﬁnition contradicts the deﬁnition of a Konig Egervary collection

in [2] (see Deﬁnition 6.1).

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let F be a relevant collection. F is said to be a Konig Egervary
collection (KE collection in short), if the following equality holds:

|[ F | + |\ F | = 2α.

Deﬁnition 2.3. An hereditary Konig Egervary collection (hke collection in short)
is a collection of sets, F , such that for some positive integer, α, the equality

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = 2α

holds for every non-empty sub-collection, Γ, of F . We call this α, α(F ). We may
omit F , where it is clear from the context.

Proposition 2.4. Let F be an hke collection. Clearly, for each A ∈ F , |A| = α(F ).
So F is a relevant collection.

Proof. By Deﬁnition 2.3, where we substitute Γ = {A}.

Proposition 2.5. Let F be a relevant collection.
collection.

If |F | ≤ 2 then it is an hke

Proof. It is clear when |F | = 1. So Assume |F | = 2, F = {A, B}. Take a non-empty
sub-collection Γ of F . Without loss of generality, Γ = F . So

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = |A ∪ B| + |A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| = 2α(F ).

Proposition 2.6. Let G be a KE graph. Then Ω(G) is an hke collection.

Proof. By [4, Theorem 3.6] and [4, Corollary 2.8].

The following deﬁnition presents the typical example of a maximal hke collection
for a ﬁxed α: by Proposition 2.8, it is an hke collection, by Theorem 3.12, it is
a maximal hke collection and by Theorem 4.9, it is the unique example up to
isomorphism.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let α be a positive integer. The typical collection for α is the
collection of subsets S of [2α] such that i ∈ S ↔ i + α /∈ S holds for every i ∈ [α].

Proposition 2.8. Let α be a positive integer. Let F be the typical collection for
α. Then F is an hke collection and |F | = 2α.

Proof. Clearly, |F | = 2α. We prove that F is an hke collection. Let Γ be a non-
empty subset of F . For each i ∈ [α] we have i ∈ S Γ if and only if i + α /∈ T Γ and
i ∈ T Γ if and only if i + α /∈ S Γ. Hence

|[ Γ ∩ [α]| + |\ Γ ∩ ([2α] − [α])| = α,

and

Therefore

|\ Γ ∩ [α]| + |[ Γ ∩ ([2α] − [α])| = α.

So F is an hke collection.

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = 2α.

⊣

In Theorem 2.13 we present equivalent conditions for F being an hke collection.
Consider the following equality:

Equality 2.9.

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [ Γ1|.

Proposition 2.10. Let F be a relevant collection.

The following are equivalent:
(1) F is an hke collection.
(2) Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2

of F ,

(3) Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2

of F with Γ1 ∪ Γ2 = F .

Before proving Proposition 2.10, we present an exercise:

Exersice 2.11. Assume that {A, B, C, D} is an hke collection (so in particular
{A, B, C} is an hke collection). Prove:

(1) |A − B − C| = |B ∩ C − A|. A clue: A − B − C = (A ∪ B ∪ C) − (B ∪ C)

and B ∩ C − A = (B ∩ C) − (A ∩ B ∩ C).

(2) |A ∩ B − C − D| = |C ∩ D − A − B|. A clue: A ∩ B − C − D = (A − C −

D) − (A − B − C − D). Apply Clause (1).

We now prove Proposition 2.10.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) : We prove it by induction on r =: |Γ1|.

Case a: r = 1, so Γ1 = {A∗} for some set A∗. In this case, we apply the idea of

Exercise 2.11(1).

We should prove that

|A∗ − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − A∗|,

4

ADI JARDEN

namely,

or equivalently,

|[ Γ2 ∪ A∗| − |[ Γ2| = |\ Γ2| − |\ Γ2 ∩ A∗|,

|[ Γ2 ∪ A∗| + |\ Γ2 ∩ A∗| = |\ Γ2| + |[ Γ2|.

But by Clause (1), each side of this equality equals 2α.

Case a: r > 1.

In this case, we apply the idea of Exercise 2.11(2). We ﬁx

A∗ ∈ Γ1. First we write three trivial equalities, for convenience:

\(Γ1 − {A∗}) = {x : x ∈ A for every A ∈ Γ1 with A 6= A∗},
[(Γ1 − {A∗}) = {x : x ∈ A for some A ∈ Γ1 with A 6= A∗}

and

We now begin the computation.

\(Γ1 ∪ {A∗}) = A∗ ∩ \ Γ1.

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\(Γ1 − {A∗}) − [ Γ2| − |\(Γ1 − {A∗}) − [(Γ2 ∪ {A∗})|.
The right side of this equality is a subtraction of two summands. We apply the

induction hypothesis on each summand:

|\(Γ1 − {A∗}) − [ Γ2| = \ Γ2 − [(Γ1 − {A∗})|

and

|\(Γ1 − {A∗}) − [(Γ2 ∪ {A∗})| = \(Γ2 ∪ {A∗}) − [(Γ1 − {A∗})|.

By the three last equalities we get:
|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [(Γ1 − {A∗})| − |\(Γ2 ∪ {A∗}) − [(Γ1 − {A∗})|.
So

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [ Γ1|.

Equality 2.9 is proved, so Clause (2) is proved.
(2) ⇒ (1) : Let Γ be a non-empty subset of F . Fix D ∈ Γ. Since F is a relevant
collection, |D| = α (this is the unique place where we use the assumption that F
is a relevant collection, but we eliminate this assumption later). Therefore it is
enough to prove that

or equivalently,

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = 2|D|,

|[ Γ − D| = |D − \ Γ|.

Let H be the set of ordered pairs hΓ1, Γ2i of non-empty disjoint subsets of Γ such
that Γ1 ∪ Γ2 = Γ and D ∈ Γ2}.

By Clause (2),

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = X

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

|\ Γ2 − [ Γ1|.

So it is enough to prove the following two equalities:

and

|[ Γ − D| = X

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2|

|D − \ Γ| = X

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

|\ Γ2 − [ Γ1|.

Since their proofs are dual, we prove the ﬁrst equality only.

[ Γ − D = [

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

(\ Γ1 − [ Γ2),

(on the one hand, if x ∈ S Γ − D then for Γ1 = {A ∈ Γ : x ∈ A} and Γ2 = {A ∈
Γ : x /∈ A} we have x ∈ T Γ1 − S Γ2 and hΓ1, Γ2i ∈ H. On the other hand, assume
that x ∈ T Γ1 − S Γ2 for some hΓ1, Γ2i ∈ H. Then x ∈ S Γ (because x ∈ T Γ1
and ∅ 6= Γ1 ⊆ Γ) and x /∈ D (because x /∈ S Γ2 and D ⊆ S Γ2). So x ∈ S Γ − D).
Therefore

|[ Γ − D| = X

hΓ1,Γ2i∈H

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2|,

because this is a sum of cardinalities of disjoint sets (if hΓ1, Γ2i and hΓ3, Γ4i are
two diﬀerent pairs in H then there is no element x ∈ (T Γ1 −S Γ2) ∩ (T Γ3 −S Γ4).
Otherwise, take A ∈ Γ1 − Γ3 (or vice versa). So A ∈ Γ4. Hence, x ∈ T Γ1 ⊆ A and
x /∈ S Γ4 ⊇ A, a contradiction).

The implication (2) ⇒ (1) is proved.
Since Clause (3) is a private case of Clause (2), it remains to prove (3) ⇒ (2).
Let Γ1, Γ2 be two non-empty disjoint subsets of F . We should prove Equality 2.9
for these Γ1 and Γ2, without assuming Γ1 ∪ Γ2 = F . Let H be the set of disjoint
pairs hΓ+

2 i of F such that Γ1 ⊆ Γ+

The following proposition eliminates the assumption that F is a relevant collec-

tion.

Proposition 2.12. Clause (3) of Proposition 2.10 implies that F is a relevant
collection.

Proof. Deﬁne

Let D ∈ F . We prove that |D| = α. Let P denote the family of partitions {Γ1, Γ2}
of F into two non-empty subcollections.

If x ∈ S F then x ∈ T Γ1 − S Γ2 for some partition {Γ1, Γ2} ∈ P or x ∈ T F .
Let

{Γ1,Γ2}∈P2

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2|.

By Clause (3) of Proposition 2.10, we have x = y.
It is easy to check the following three equalities:
(1) |S F | = x + y + |T F | = 2x + |T F |,
(2) |D| = x + |T F | and
(3) |S F | + |T F | = 2α.
Hence, |D| = α. Since D was an arbitrary set in F , F is a relevant collection. ⊣

Theorem 2.13. Let F be a collection of sets.

The following are equivalent:
(1) F is an hke collection.
(2) Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2

of F ,

(3) Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2

of F with Γ1 ∪ Γ2 = F .

Proof. By Proposition 2.10, it is enough to prove that each clause implies that F
is a relevant collection. By Proposition 2.4, Clause (1) implies that F is a relevant
collection. By Proposition 2.12 Clause (3) implies that F is a relevant collection.
⊣
But Clause (2) implies Clause (3).

Corollary 2.14. Let G be a graph. The following are equivalent:

(1) G is a KE graph.

(2) For some non-empty hke collection F ⊆ Ω(G), there is a matching M :
V [G]−S F → T F and Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint
sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2 of F .
(3) For some non-empty hke collection F ⊆ Ω(G), there is a matching M :
V [G]−S F → T F and Equality 2.9 holds for every two non-empty disjoint
sub-collections, Γ1, Γ2 of F with Γ1 ∪ Γ2 = F .

Proof. By Theorem 2.13 and Theorem 1.1.

3. Maximal hke Collections

In this section, we study maximal hke collections. A priori it is not clear whether
there is a maximal hke collection, but we prove it. Moreover, we prove the unique-
ness of a maximal hke collection for a given α and characterize it.

The most simple characterization of a maximal hke collection is its cardinality:
|F | = 2α (see Theorem 3.12). This theorem is proved by the following argument:
Let F be a maximal hke collection. We ﬁx a set A ∈ F and present a bijection
fA : F → P (A).

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let F be an hke collection. For each A ∈ F , we deﬁne a function
fA : F → P (A) by fA(D) = A ∩ D.

In the next propositions we present several properties of a maximal hke collection:
(1) by Proposition 3.2, fA is an injection (actually, this property holds for every

hke collection),

(2) by Proposition 3.4, T F = ∅,
(3) by Proposition 3.10 fA is a surjection and
(4) By Theorem 3.12, |F | = 2α.

Proposition 3.2. Let F be an hke collection and let A ∈ F . Then the function fA
is an injection of F into P (A). So |F | ≤ 2α.

Proof. Let A, B, C ∈ F with A ∩ B = A ∩ C. We have to show that B = C. By
symmetry, it is enough to prove that C ⊆ B. But A∩B −C = (A∩B)−(A∩C) = ∅.
So |C − A − B| = |A ∩ B − C| = 0, namely, C − B ⊆ A. Hence, C − B ⊆
(A ∩ C) − (A ∩ B) = ∅.
⊣

Proposition 3.3. If F is an hke collection and |F | = 2α then F is a maximal hke
collection.

Proof. By Proposition 3.2
Proposition 3.4. Let F be a maximal hke collection. Then T F = ∅.
Proof. Fix A ∈ F . Deﬁne

⊣

B = A ∪ C − \ F,

where C is a set of new elements (C ∩S F = ∅) of cardinality |T F |. We now prove
that F ′ = F ∪ {B} is an hke collection. First note that |B| = |A| = α. Let Γ1 and
Γ2 be two non-empty disjoint subsets of F ′. We have to show that Equality 2.9
holds.

If B /∈ Γ1 ∪ Γ2 then it holds, because F is an hke collection. Assume that
B ∈ Γ1 ∪ Γ2. Since Γ1 and Γ2 are disjoint, by symmetry, we may assume that
B ∈ Γ1 − Γ2. The proof is separated into four cases, according to the following two
questions:

8

ADI JARDEN

(1) Is B the only set in Γ1?
(2) Does A belong to Γ2?

Case a: Γ1 = {B} and A ∈ Γ2. In this case,

\ Γ1 − [ Γ2 ⊆ B − A = C ⊆ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2.

So

Similarly,

\ Γ1 − [ Γ2 = C.

\ Γ2 − [ Γ1 = \ F.

Since |C| = |T F |, Equality 2.9 holds.

Case b: B ∈ Γ1, 1 < |Γ1| and A ∈ Γ2. In this case,

\ Γ1 − [ Γ2 = ∅ = [ Γ2 − [ Γ1.

Case c: Γ1 = {B} and A /∈ Γ2. In this case, T Γ1 = S Γ1 = B and

|B − [ Γ2| = |C| + |A − [ Γ2| = |C| + |\ Γ2 − A| = |\ Γ2 − B|,

(the second equality holds, because F is an hke collection). So Equality 2.9 holds
in this case, too.

Case d: B ∈ Γ1, 1 < |Γ1| and A /∈ Γ2. In this case, we prove the following claim:

Claim 3.5. Deﬁne Γ3 = Γ1 − {B} ∪ {A}. The following things hold:

(1) T Γ1 − S Γ2 = T Γ3 − S Γ2,
(2) T Γ2 − S Γ1 = T Γ2 − S Γ3 and
(3) |T Γ3 − S Γ2| = |T Γ2 − S Γ3|.

Proof. (1) Since T F ⊆ S Γ2, it is enough to show that if x ∈ S F ′ − T F then
x ∈ T Γ1 if and only if x ∈ T Γ3. If x ∈ C then clearly x /∈ T Γ3, so x does not
belong to the right side. But since 1 < |Γ1|, x does not belong to T Γ1 too. If
x /∈ C then clearly, x ∈ T Γ1 if and only if x ∈ T Γ3.
(2) Let x ∈ T Γ2. So x /∈ C. We show that x ∈ S Γ1 if and only if x ∈ S Γ3.
If x ∈ T F then x belongs to both S Γ1 (because 1 < |Γ1|) and S Γ3. If x /∈ T F
then clearly it belongs to S Γ1 if and only if it belongs to S γ3.
(3) Since A /∈ Γ2, the collections Γ2 and Γ3 are disjoint subcollections of F . But
F is an hke collection. Therefore by Theorem 2.13, Equality 2.9 holds for Γ2 and
⊣
Γ3.

Claim 3.5 implies Equality 2.9 (for Γ1 and Γ2). Proposition 3.4 is proved.

⊣

Letting an hke collection, F , Proposition 3.6 presents a suﬃcient and necessary
condition for F ∪ {D} being an hke collection. It is a preparation for Proposition
3.10. In [1] we present an improved version of Proposition 3.6.

We know by Theorem 2.13 that F ∪ {D} is an hke collection if and only if
Equality 2.9 holds for each partition of F ∪ {D}. Proposition 3.6 presents a weaker
condition: it is enough to consider partitions of F ∪ {D} into two subcollections,
such that A and D belong to the same subcollection.

Proposition 3.6. Let F be an hke collection, let A ∈ F and let D be an arbitrary
set. Then F ∪{D} is an hke collection if and only if |D| = α and for every partition
{Γ1, Γ2} of F − {A} with Γ2 6= ∅, the following holds:

|A ∩ D ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [ Γ1 − A − D|

(if Γ1 = ∅ then we ignore S Γ1 and T Γ1, or more formarlly stipulate T Γ1 =
S F ∪ {D}).

Before proving Proposition 3.6, we present an application for a relevant collection

of cardinality 3.

Corollary 3.7. Let F ′ = {A, B, D} be a relevant collection of cardinality 3. Then
F ′ is an hke collection if and only if |A ∩ D − B| = |B − A − D|.

Proof. F = {A, B} is an hke collection, because its cardinality is 2. F − {A} =
{B}. The unique partition {Γ1, Γ2} of {B} with Γ2 6= ∅ is {∅, {B}}. Now apply
⊣
Proposition 3.6.

We now prove Proposition 3.6.

Proof. Let us call the equality above, ‘Equality (*)’.

If F ∪ {D} is an hke collection then by Proposition 2.13((1) → (3)), Equality (*)

holds.

Conversely, assume that |D| = α and Equality (*) holds. Applying again Propo-

sition 2.13((3) → (1)), it remains to prove that

(**) |A ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2 − D| = |D ∩ \ Γ2 − [ Γ1 − A|,
for every partition {Γ1, Γ2} of F − {A} (including that case Γ2 = ∅).

Case A: Γ2 6= ∅. In this case, we do not use the fact that |D| = α. Since F is

an hke collection, the following equality holds:

|A ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [ Γ1 − A|.

Hence, by subtracting Equality (*) from the last equality, we obtain Equality

(**).

Case B: Γ2 = ∅. In this case, we have to prove

We use the assumption |D| = α and Case A.

|\ F − D| = |D − [ F |.

Claim 3.8.

|\ Γ1 − [ Γ2 − D| = |D ∩ \ Γ2 − [ Γ1|

holds, for each partition {Γ1, Γ2} of F into two non-empty subcollections.

Proof. By Equality (**) in case A and by Equality (*).

⊣

Consider the following partition of D:

D = {D ∩ \ Γ2 − [ Γ1 : {Γ1, Γ2} is a partition of F }.

For every set D′ ∈ D, we deﬁne a ‘pseudo dual set’, (D′)d, that is a subset of A

as follows:

10

ADI JARDEN

(D ∩ \ Γ2 − [ Γ1)d = nD ∩ T Γ2 − S Γ1,
T Γ1 − S Γ2 − D,

if A ∈ Γ2
if A /∈ Γ2

By Claim 3.8, |(D′)d| = |D′| holds for each D′ ∈ D, except maybe two sets:
D ∩ T F and D − S F . But (D ∩ T F )d = D ∩ T F . So the equality |(D′)d| = |D′|
holds for D ∩ T F as well. Our goal is to prove this equality for D − S F : to prove
that |(D − S F )d| = |D − S F | (namely, |T F − D| = |D − S F |).

Deﬁne

A = {(D′)d : D′ ∈ D}.
Since |D| = α = |A|, if A is a partition of A then
|D′| = |D| = |A| = X

D′∈D

D′∈D

|(D′)d|

and so the equality |(D′)d| = |D′| holds for D′ = D − S F as needed.

By the following claim, A is a partition of A:

Claim 3.9. A satisﬁes the following things:

(1) S A ⊆ A,
(2) A ⊆ S A and
(3) the pseudo dual sets of each two diﬀerent sets in D are disjoint.

Proof. (1) Clear.

(2) Let x ∈ A. Deﬁne Γ2 = {B ∈ F : x ∈ B} and Γ1 = F − Γ2. So x ∈

T Γ2 − S Γ1 and A ∈ Γ2. If x ∈ D then x ∈ D ∩ T Γ2 − S Γ1 ∈ A. So x ∈ S A.
If x /∈ D then x ∈ T Γ2 − S Γ1 − D ∈ A, because T Γ2 − S Γ1 − D is the pseudo
dual of D ∩ T Γ1 − S Γ2. So x ∈ S A.
(3) Take two diﬀerent partitions {Γa
If A ∈ Γa

1, Γb

2} of F .
2 −S Γa

By the following proposition, if F is a maximal hke collection, then for each
A ∈ F , fA is onto the power set of A. Moreover, it speciﬁes several properties of a
set D that can be added to F , if fA is not a surjection.

Proposition 3.10. Let F be an hke collection. Let E ⊆ A ∈ F . Then we can ﬁnd
a set D such that the following holds:

(1) A ∩ D = E,
(2) F ∪ {D} is an hke collection and
(3) |D − S F | = |T F − E|.

In particular, if T F = ∅ then D ⊆ S F .

It is recommended to assume T F = ∅ at the ﬁrst reading of the following proof.

Proof. Let us give a rough description of the proof: The needed D should be a set
of cardinality α that includes E with A ∩ D = E. So D will be the union of E with
α − |E| elements that are not in A. For each non-empty subset Γ of F − {A} the
‘dual set’ has the same number of elements. But we subtract eΓ elements from the
dual set, so that at the end, we will subtract |E| elements. But if Γ = ∅ then there
is no dual set and we have to choose elements outside of S F .

For every subset Γ of F such that A ∈ Γ, we deﬁne eΓ as follows: Deﬁne Γ1 = Γ

Clearly D ∩ A = E.
It remains to show that F ∪{D} is an hke collection. In order to apply Proposition

3.6, we ﬁrstly have to prove that |D| = α.

|D| = |E| + |[ F − A| − ΣA∈Γ(F eΓ + |C|.
By Equality (1) and the equality |C| = |T F | − eF , we get

|D| = |E| + |[ F − A| − ΣA∈Γ⊂F eΓ + |\ F | = |[ F | + |\ F | − |A| = 2α − α = α.
The equality |D| = α is proved. It remains to show that the second condition of

Proposition 3.6 is satisﬁed.

Let {Γ1, Γ2} be a partition of F such that A ∈ Γ1 and Γ2 6= ∅.
We have to show that

|D ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |\ Γ2 − [ Γ1 − D|.

Deﬁne Γ = Γ1. Since D ∩ A = E and A ∈ Γ1,

|D ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = |E ∩ \ Γ1 − [ Γ2| = eΓ.

It remains to show that

|\ Γ2 − [ Γ1 − D| = eΓ.

Remark 3.11. We now can present a new proof of Proposition 3.4. Assume that
T F 6= ∅. Deﬁne E = ∅. Let A ∈ F . E ⊆ A is not in the image of fA, because
A ∩ D = T F 6= ∅ for each D ∈ F . So fA is not a surjection and by Proposition
3.10, F is not a maximal hke collection.

Theorem 3.12. Let F be an hke collection. Then F is a maximal hke collection
if and only if |F | = 2α.

Proof. If |F | = 2α then by Proposition 3.3, F is a maximal hke collection.

Conversely, assume that F is a maximal hke collection. Fix A ∈ F . By Propo-

sitions 3.2 and 3.10, fA : F → P (A) is a bijection. So |F | = 2α.

4. The Uniqueness of a Maximal hke Collection

In this section (Theorem 4.2), we present two similar characterizations of a max-
imal hke collection and use it to prove the uniqueness of a maximal hke collection
for a ﬁxed α (Theorem 4.9). Moreover, this characterization yields a connection
between maximal hke collections and minimal KE graphs (Theorem 5.11).

The following deﬁnition is needed in order to state Theorem 4.2.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let F be an hke collection. We deﬁne a relation ≈ on S F as
follows: x ≈ y if and only if x = y or A − D = {x} and D − A = {y} for some
A, D ∈ F . If F is not clear from the context, we will write ≈F . If F is a maximal
hke collection, x 6= y and x ≈ y then y is said to be the dual of x (this name is
justiﬁed in the proof of Theorem 4.2). If F is not clear from the context, we will
write ‘the F -dual’.

Clauses (2) and (3) of Theorem 4.2 are similar. In Clause (2), we require the
existence of an equivalence relation satisfying several speciﬁc properties. In Clause
(3), we require that ≈ will satisfy these properties.

Theorem 4.2. Let F be a relevant collection with α(F ) = α. The following things
are equivalent:

(1) F is a maximal hke collection.
(2) |S F | = 2α and there is an equivalence relation on S F with α equivalence
classes, each has two elements such that F equals the collection of subsets
B of S F such that |B| = α and B intersects each equivalence class.

HEREDITARY KONIG EGERVARY COLLECTIONS

13

(3) |S F | = 2α, ≈ has α equivalence classes, each equivalence class has two
elements and F equals the collection of subsets B of S F such that |B| = α
and B intersects each ≈-equivalence class.

Proof. Clause (3) implies Clause (2) trivially. Assume that Clause (2) holds. By
renaming, without loss of generality, S F = [2α] and the equivalence classes are the
pairs of the form {m, m + α} for 1 ≤ m ≤ α. Then F is the typical collection for
α. So by Proposition 2.8, F is an hke collection and |F | = 2α. So by Proposition
3.3, Clause (1) holds.

It remains to prove that Clause (1) implies Clause (3). Assume that F is a

relation and study its properties.
Claim 4.3. For every x ∈ S F , there are two sets A and D in F such that A−D =
{x}.

Proof. Take A ∈ F such that x ∈ A. By Proposition 3.10, fA is a surjection. So
there is a set D ∈ F such that A ∩ D = A − {x}. Therefore A − D = {x}.
⊣

By Claim 4.6 (below), the relation ≈ is an equivalence relation. By the following

claim, each ≈-equivalence class has two elements at least.

Claim 4.4. For every element x ∈ S F , there is an element y ∈ S F such that
x ≈ y and x 6= y.

Proof. By Claim 4.3, there are two sets, A and D in F , such that A − D = {x}.
By Theorem 2.13, |D − A| = |A − D| = 1. Let y be the unique element in D − A.
Then x ≈ y.
⊣

Claim 4.5. Let x, y be two diﬀerent elements in S F . Then x ≈ y if and only if
x ∈ B ↔ y /∈ B holds for every B ∈ F .

Proof. First assume that x ∈ B ↔ y /∈ B holds for every B ∈ F . By Claim 4.3,
there are two sets A and D in F , such that A − D = {x}. So |D − A| = |A − D| = 1.
But y ∈ A − D. Therefore D − A = {y} and x ≈ y.

Conversely, assume that x ≈ y. So there are A and D in F such that A−D = {x}
and D − A = {y}. Let B ∈ F . We show that x ∈ B if and only if y /∈ B using the
following three equalities:

(1) A ∩ B − D = (A − D) ∩ B = {x} ∩ B,
(2) |A ∩ B − D| = |D − A − B| (By Theorem 2.13) and
(3) D − A − B = {y} − B .
x ∈ B if and only if {x} ∩ B 6= ∅ if and only if |A ∩ B − D| 6= 0 if and only if

|D − A − B| 6= 0 if and only if {y} − B 6= ∅, namely y /∈ B.

⊣

By the following claim, the relation ≈ is transitive, so it is an equivalence relation.

Moreover, each equivalence class has two elements at most.

Claim 4.6. If x 6= y, x ≈ y, y 6= z and y ≈ z then x = z.

[Here is another formulation of Claim 4.6: if x is the dual of y and z is the dual

of y then x = z.]

14

ADI JARDEN

Proof. By Claim 4.5, for every B ∈ F , we have

x ∈ B ⇔ y /∈ B ⇔ z ∈ B.

By Claim 4.3, there are two sets, A, D ∈ F such that A − D = {x}. Since
⊣

x ∈ A − D, we have z ∈ A − D, as well. So z ∈ {x}, namely, z = x.

Claim 4.7. The relation ≈ is an equivalence relation. It has α equivalence classes,
each has two elements exactly.

Proof. By its deﬁnition, the relation ≈ is reﬂexive and symmetric. By Claim 4.6,
≈ is transitive. So it is an equivalence relation. By Claim 4.4, each equivalence
class of ≈ has two elements at least. By Claim 4.6 each equivalence class of ≈ has
two elements at most. So each equivalence class of ≈ has exactly two elements.

We now show that there are exactly α ≈-equivalence classes. Fix A ∈ F . Let f
be the function of the set of ≈-equivalence classes to A, such that f ({x, y}) is the
unique element in {x, y} ∩ A. The number of ≈-equivalence classes is α, because f
is a bijection: Let {x, y} be an ≈-equivalence class. By Claim 4.5, x /∈ A if and only
if y ∈ A. So f is well-deﬁned. Since each x ∈ A is in some ≈-equivalence class, f is
surjective. Since an element in A cannot be in two diﬀerent ≈-equivalence classes
⊣
at the same time, f is injective.
Let F ′ be the collection of subsets B of S F such that |B| = α and B intersects
each equivalence class of ≈. By Claim 4.7, F ′ is the collection of subsets B of S F
such that |B ∩ {x, y}| = 1 for each equivalence class {x, y} of ≈. So |F ′| = 2α.
It remains to prove that F ′ = F . Since F is a maximal hke collection, by
Theorem 3.12, |F | = 2α too. So it is enough to prove that F ⊆ F ′. Let B ∈ F .
So |B| = α. Let {x, y} be an ≈-equivalence relation. Since x ≈ y, By Claim 4.5,
x ∈ B if and only y /∈ B. So {x, y} ∩ B 6= ∅. Therefore B ∈ F ′. Hence, F ′ = F .
⊣
Clause (3) is proved. So Theorem 4.2 is proved.

Deﬁnition 4.8. Let F1 and F2 be two collections of sets. We say that F1 and F2
are isomorphic when: there is a bijection g : S F1 → S F2 such that g[S] ∈ F2 for
every S ∈ F1 and g−1[S] ∈ F1 for every S ∈ F2.

By the following theorem, up to isomorphism, there is a unique maximal hke

collection with α ﬁxed:

Theorem 4.9. If F1 and F2 are two maximal hke collections with α(F1) = α(F2)
then F1 ∼= F2.
Proof. Deﬁne α = α(F1) = α(F2). Fix A1 ∈ F1 and A2 ∈ F2. So |A1| = |A2| = α.
Let f : A1 → A2 be a bijection. Extend f to a function g : S F1 → S F2 such that
if y is the dual of x in F1 then g(y) is the dual of g(x) in F2 (it holds vacuously for
x, y ∈ A1, because in this case, y is not the dual of x). So for every two elements
x, y ∈ S F1, y is the dual of x in F1 if and only if g(y) is the dual of g(x) in F2. By
Claim 4.7, g is bijective.
By the symmetry between F1 and F2, in order to prove that g is an isomorphism,
it is enough to show that g[S] belongs to F2 for each S ∈ F1. By Theorem 4.2((1) →
(3)), for every subset B of S F2 the following holds: B ∈ F2 if and only if α ≤ |B|
and each two diﬀerent elements in B are not ≈F2-equivalent.
Since g is injective, α = |S| ≤ g[S]. Let g(x), g(y) be two diﬀerent elements in
g[S]. If g(x) ≈F2 g(y) then g(y) is the dual of g(x) and so y is the dual of x. But
⊣
y cannot be the dual of x, because they are both in S.

Corollary 4.10. Let F be a relavant collection with α(F ) = α. Then F is a
maximal hke collection if and only if F is isomorphic to the typical collection for
α.

Proof. By Theorem 4.9, we have only to prove that if F is the typical collection for
α then F is a maximal hke collection. Assume that F is the typical collection for
α. By Proposition 2.8, F is an hke collection and |F | = 2α. So by Theorem 3.12,
⊣
F is a maximal hke collection.

The following corollary will be used in the proof of Theorem 5.11.

Corollary 4.11. Let F be a maximal hke collection. Let x and y be two diﬀerent
elements in S F . Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) x ≈ y,
(2) {x, y} ∩ S 6= ∅ for each S ∈ F and
(3) {x, y} * S for each S ∈ F .

Proof. By Corollary 4.10, without loss of generality, F is the typical collection for
α (in particular, x and y are numbers in [2α]). So each condition ((1), (2) and (3))
is equivalent to the condition |x − y| = α.
⊣

5. From a Collection to a Graph

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let F be a relevant collection. The graph of F , G(F ), is the graph
(V (G), E(G)), where V (G) =: S F and E(G) =: {vu : v, u ∈ G and there is no
A ∈ F such that {u, v} ⊆ A}.

G(F ) has the maximal set of edges such that each set in F is independent.

Proposition 5.2. Let F be a relevant collection. Then α(F ) ≤ α(G(F )).

Proof. Every set in F is independent in G(F ). Therefore α(F ) ≤ α(G(F )).

⊣

It is easy to ﬁnd a relevant collection, F , such that α(F ) < α(G(F )).

Example 5.3.

F := {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}

Here, α(F ) = 2, while α(G(F )) = 3.

Example 5.4.

F := {{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}, {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}}

Here, α(F ) = 6, while α(G(F )) = 7.

Recall:

Deﬁnition 5.5. A well-covered graph is a graph in which every independent set
can be extended to a maximum independent set.

Proposition 5.6. For every well-covered graph G with V (G) = corona(G), the
graph of Ω(G) is G.

Proof. Let G be a well-covered graph with V (G) = corona(G) and let G′ be the
graph of Ω(G). We should prove that G = G′. They have the same set of vertices:

V (G′) = [ Ω(G) = corona(G) = V (G).

16

ADI JARDEN

They have the same set of edges as well: First assume that (uv) ∈ E(G). {u, v} *
X, for every X ∈ Ω(G). So (uv) ∈ E(G′). Conversely, assume that (uv) /∈ E(G).
So {u, v} is an independent set in G. Since G is well-covered, we can ﬁnd a set
X ∈ Ω(G) such that {u, v} ⊆ X. Therefore (uv) /∈ E(G′).
⊣

The next example exempliﬁes the following facts:
(1) there is an hke collection F such that Ω(G) 6= F for every graph G and
(2) we can ﬁnd two diﬀerent hke collections, F1 and F2 such that G(F1) =

G(F2).

Example 5.7.

F := {{1, 3, 5}, {1, 4, 6}, {2, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {2, 4, 6}}.

F is an hke collection and G(F ) is the bipartite graph G = (V, E) with V =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and E = {12, 34, 36, 56}. But

Ω(G) = {{1, 3, 5}, {1, 4, 6}, {2, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {2, 4, 6}, {1, 4, 5}} = F ∪ {1, 4, 5} 6= F.

Actually, there is no graph G with Ω(G) = F . For let G be a graph with

F ⊆ Ω(G). So E(G) ∩ {45, 14, 15} = ∅. But in this case, {1, 4, 5} ∈ Ω(G) − F .
The graph of Ω(G) is G too. So F1 = F and F2 = Ω(G) examplify Fact (2).

Example 5.8.

F = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 4}}.

α(F ) = 2, S F = {1, 2, 3, 4} and T F = ∅. But F is not an hke collection, because
its subcollection, Γ = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}, is not a KE collection. Let G be the
graph of F . α(G) = 3 (because {1, 2, 3} ∈ Ω(G)) and G is not a KE graph.

Problem 5.9. Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) be two KE graphs. We say
that G1 and G2 are equivalent when Ω(G1) ∼= Ω(G2). Find connections between
equivalent graphs.

Deﬁnition 5.10. The typical KE graph for α is the following bipartite graph:
V (G) = [2α] and E(G) = {i, i + α : i ∈ [α]}.

Theorem 5.11. Let G be a graph such that V (G) = corona(G). Then G is iso-
morphic to the typical KE graph for α(G) if and only if Ω(G) is a maximal hke
collection.

Proof. Assume that G is isomorphic to the typical KE graph for α. Without loss of
generality V (G) = [2α] and E(G) = {i, i + α : i ∈ [α]}, for some α. So a maximal
independent set in G has α elements. Clearly, Ω(G) is the typical collection for α.
Hence, by Corollary 4.10, Ω(G) is a maximal hke collection.

Conversely, assume that Ω(G) is a maximal hke collection. By Theorem 4.10,
without loss of generality, Ω(G) is the typical collection for α. So corona(G) =
S Ω(G) = [2α]. Therefore V (G) = corona(G) = [2α].
or equivalently, x is the Ω(G)-dual of y.

By Deﬁnition 5.10, it remains to prove that xy ∈ E(G) if and only if |x − y| = α,

Claim 5.12. Let x and y be two diﬀerent vertices. If xy ∈ E(G) then x is the
Ω(G)-dual of y.

Proof. For every S ∈ Ω(G), S is independent and so the set {x, y} is not included
⊣
in S. Hence, by Corollary 4.11, x is the Ω(G)-dual of y.

HEREDITARY KONIG EGERVARY COLLECTIONS

17

Claim 5.13. Let x and y be two diﬀerent vertices. Then xy ∈ E(G) if and only if
x is the Ω(G)-dual of y.

Proof. The ﬁrst direction holds by Claim 5.12. In order to prove the second di-
rection, we assume that xy /∈ E(G). For the sake of a contradiction, assume that
x is the Ω(G)-dual of y. So by the uniqueness of the Ω(G)-dual of y, for every
z ∈ V (G) − {x, y}, z is not the Ω(G)-dual of y. By Claim 5.12, zy /∈ E(G). But by
assumption, xy /∈ E(G). So for every z ∈ V (G) − {y}, zy /∈ E(G).

Take S ∈ Ω(G) such that x ∈ S. Since x ≈ y, by Corollary 4.11, y /∈ S. Hence,
⊣

S ∪ {y} is an independent set of cardinality α + 1, a contradiction.

Theorem 5.11 is proved.

6. The Subcollections of Ω(G) where G is KE

We now can solve a problem of Jarden, Levit and Mandrescu.
The deﬁnition of a KE collection in [2], is diﬀerent from the deﬁnition in the

current paper.

Deﬁnition 6.1. A relevant collection, F , is said to be a KE collection in the old
sense if F ⊆ Ω(G), for some graph G and |S F | + |T F | = 2α(G).

We restate [2, Problem 3.1]:

Problem 6.2. Characterize the KE collections in the old sense.

Theorem 6.3. Let F be a collection of sets. The following conditions are equiva-
lent:

(1) F is an hke collection,
(2) F is isomorphic to a subcollection of the typical collection for α(F ),
(3) F is included in Ω(G) for some KE graph G and
(4) F is a KE collection in the old sense.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that Clause (1) implies clause (2). Assume that F is an hke
collection. Let F ′ be a maximal hke collection including F . Clearly, α(F ′) = α(F ).
Let G be the typical graph for α(F ). By Theorem 5.11, Ω(G) is a maximal hke.
So by Theorem 4.9, F ′ is isomorphic to Ω(G). Clause (2) is proved.

Easily, Clause (2) implies Clause (3).
If Clause (3) holds then

|[ F | + |\ F | ≤ |[ Ω(G)| + |\ Ω(G)| = 2α.

So Clause (4) holds.

Assume that Clause (4) holds, namely, F is a KE collection in the old sense. So

F ⊆ Ω(G) for some graph G and

Let Γ be a subcollection of F . By [4, Corollary 2.7 and Corollary 2.9],

|[ F | + |\ F | = 2α(G).

|[ Γ| + |\ Γ| = 2α(G).

7. Adding A Limitation on |S F |

In this section, we prove that for every two positive integers α and n, the max-
imal cardinality of an hke collection, F , with α(F ) = α and |S F | = n is 2n−α.
We conclude that for every positive integer n, the maximal cardinality of an hke
collection, F , with |S F | = n is 2α if n = 2α or n = 2α + 1.
α ≤ n ≤ 2α in the following deﬁnition is needed.

Since every hke collection F satisﬁes α(F ) ≤ |S F | ≤ 2α(F ), the assumption

Deﬁnition 7.1. Let a(α, n) be the maximal number of sets in an hke collection
F with α(F ) = α and |S F | = n, where α and n are positive integers satisfying
α ≤ n ≤ 2α.

Proposition 7.2. For every two positive integers α and n satsfying α ≤ n ≤ 2α,
we have a(α, n) ≤ 2α.

Proof. By Theorem 3.12.

⊣

Proposition 7.3. For every positive integer α, we have a(α, 2α) = 2α.

Proof. By Proposition 7.2, a(α, 2α) ≤ 2α. The typical example for α exempliﬁes
⊣
the converse.

In order to prove that a(α, n) = 2n−α, it remains to prove that a(α, n) = a(n −

α, 2n − 2α). Propositions 7.4 and 7.5 are steps towards this goal.

Proposition 7.4. Let α, n and d be positive integers with α ≤ n ≤ 2α.

(1) a(α, n) ≤ a(α − d, n − d) whenever a(α − d, n − d) is deﬁned (namely,

d ≤ 2α − n) and

(2) a(α, n) ≤ a(α + d, n + d).

Proof. Let F be an hke collection with α(F ) = α and |S F | = n.

F ′ = {A − C : A ∈ F }.

C ∩ S F = ∅. Since |S F ′| = n + d, α(F ′) = α + d and |F ′| = |F |, it remains to

Proposition 7.5. Let α and n be positive integers satisfying α ≤ n ≤ 2α.
−∞ < d ≤ 2α − n, then

a(α, n) = a(α − d, n − d).

If

Proof. By Proposition 7.4, it is enough to show that a(α − d, n − d) is deﬁned.
The assumption d ≤ 2α − n is equivalent to α′ ≤ n′ ≤ 2α′ where α′ = α − d
and n′ = n − d [d ≤ 2α − n yields n′ ≤ 2α′, for 2α′ = 2α − 2d = 2α − d − d ≥
2α − d + (n − 2α) = n − d = n′]. So a(α − d, n − d) is deﬁned.

Theorem 7.6.

a(α, n) = 2n−α

holds for each two positive integers α and n satisfying α ≤ n ≤ 2α.

Proof. By Proposition 7.5 (where 2α − n stands for d), we have

But by Proposition 7.3,

a(α, n) = a(n − α, 2n − 2α).

a(n − α, 2n − 2α) = 2n−α.

Let ⌈n⌉ denote the integral value of n.

c(n) = max{a(α, n) : α ≤ n ≤ 2α}.

Connections between the current paper, [3], [5] and [6] should be studied.
