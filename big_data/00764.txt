TOWARDS MONITORING CRITICAL MICROSCOPIC PARAMETERS

FOR ELECTROPERMEABILIZATION

H. AMMARI, T. WIDLAK, AND W. ZHANG

Abstract. Electropermeabilization is a clinical technique in cancer treatment to locally
stimulate the cell metabolism. It is based on electrical ﬁelds that change the properties of
the cell membrane. With that, cancer treatment can reach the cell more easily. Electrop-
ermeabilization occurs only with accurate dosage of the electrical ﬁeld. For applications, a
monitoring for the amount of electropermeabilization is needed. It is a ﬁrst step to image the
macroscopic electrical ﬁeld during the process. Nevertheless, this is not complete, because
electropermeabilization depends on critical individual properties of the cells such as their
curvature. From the macroscopic ﬁeld, one cannot directly infer that microscopic state. In
this article, we study eﬀective parameters in a homogenization model as the next step to mon-
itor the microscopic properties in clinical practice. We start from a physiological cell model
for electropermeabilization and analyze its well-posedness. For a dynamical homogenization
scheme, we prove convergence and then analyze the eﬀective parameters, which can be found
by macroscopic imaging methods. We demonstrate numerically the sensitivity of these eﬀec-
tive parameters to critical microscopic parameters governing electropermeabilization. This
opens the door to solve the inverse problem of rreconstructing these parameters.

1. Introduction

The technique of electropermeabilization (formerly referred to as electroporation) is em-
ployed to make the chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer more eﬃcient and avoid side-
eﬀects. Instead of spreading out drugs over the whole body, electropermeabilization makes it
possible to focus drug application on special areas. The mechanism of electropermeabilization
relies on careful exposition of biological tissue to electrical ﬁelds: this changes the membrane
properties of the cells such that treatment can enter more easily just at precisely deﬁned areas
of the tissue [6, 12].

The local change in microscopic tissue properties, which electropermeabilization eﬀects,
occurs only with ﬁeld strengths above a certain threshold. On the other hand, too strong
ﬁelds result in cell death. One therefore thinks of electropermeabilization occurring within a
certain threshold of intensity of the local electric ﬁeld [4].

For treatment planning in electropermeabilization, one is interested in the percentage of
electroporated cells over the whole tissue to form decisions in the short term how to gear
treatment [10, 4, 12].

This work was supported by the ERC Advanced Grant Project MULTIMOD–267184.

One would like supervise the electropermeabilization using measurements of the electric
ﬁeld distribution with image modalities like in [10]. In that work, measurements of magnetic
resonance electrical impedance tomography [19] have been employed to ﬁnd the electrical ﬁeld
distribution. A threshold is then applied to ﬁnd the electroporated cells.

Yet this approach is only the ﬁrst step in a larger program:

quantity;

• the electrical ﬁeld distribution reconstructed by an imaging modality is a macroscopic
• the thresholding hypothesis is a simpliﬁcation and should be reﬁned [4];
• the minimum transmembrane voltage governing electropermeabilization is determined

by speciﬁc cell characteristics like the curvature of the cell membrane [21].

One solution to ﬁnd about microscopic parameters from measurements is to take general
models and do a speciﬁc parameter ﬁtting with preselected cells like in [4]. In clinical practice,
though, a preselected cell population may be unavailable for the analysis.

In this paper, we tackle the next step in electropermeabilization monitoring and investi-
gate the question to determine microscopic parameters from macroscopic measurements. The
modelling used stems from general physiological tissue models for cells, asymptotically simpli-
ﬁed by Neu and Krassowska [14]. Whereas the mathematical well-posedness of the model of
that model is not available in the literature, there exists an investigation of well-posedness for
a similar model in [8]. In this paper, demonstrate the local well-posedness of the asymptotic
cell model of [14], as well as the absence of a blow up. A variant of the model is shown to be
globally well-posed.

In order to describe the relation between macroscopic and microscopic quantities, we apply
the homogenization scheme in [2] to the cell model of Neu and Krassowska [14]. This not
only describes isotropic eﬀective parameters such as classical theory [16], but includes also
anisotropy. We provide a convergence analysis for the homogenized solution.

Then we study numerically the sensitivity of the eﬀective parameters to:

• the conductivities of the extra- and intracellular media;
• the shape of the cell membrane;
• the volume fraction of the cells;
• the lattice structure of the cells.

We refer to research in [21, 7, 11, 15, 18], where these critical parameters for electroperme-
abilization have been investigated, partly from an empirical or computer simulation point of
view.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the model of [14] on
the cellular scale. In Section 3, we investigate its well-posedness properties. In Section 4,
we perform the homogenization and show the convergence of the homogenized solution. In
Section 5, we provide a sensitivity analysis of the eﬀective parameters, showing dependence
on microscopic properties, summarized in Table 2. A discussion and ﬁnal remarks in Section 6
conclude the article.

2. Modelling electropermeabilization on the cellular scale

2.1. Membrane model. Let Y (cid:98) Rd be a bounded domain representing the cell, and let
Γ ⊂ Y be the membrane of the cell. Let

Y \ Γ = Yi ∪ Ye,

where Yi (resp. Ye) is be the inner (resp. the outer) domain. Let σi(x) be the conductivity
of the cell domain Yi, and σe(x) be the conductivity outside the cells on Ye.

Let u0 be an imposed voltage on the boundary of Y . An electrostatic model for the electrical

ﬁeld u(x, t) on Y in the inner and outer domain is

∇ · (σ(x) ∇u(x, t)) = 0
u = u0

σen · ∇u+ = σin · ∇u− = σn · ∇u = σ∂nu

on Y \ Γ = Yi ∪ Ye,
on ∂Y , with ∆u0 = 0 in Y,
on Γ.

(3)

Here and throughout this paper, ∂n denotes the normal derivative.

2.2. Electropermeabilization models. In addition to the membrane model, a time-varying
conductivity σm(x, t) for x ∈ Γ is taken account of. The general eﬀect of electropermeabiliza-
tion is described by relating σm and the membrane thickness δ to the transmembrane potential
(TMP) jump u+(x, t) − u−(x, t) := [u](x, t) in an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) on Γ:

σ(x)n · ∇u(x, t) =

∂t[u](x, t) +

σm ([u](x, t), t)

[u](x, t)

on Γ.

(4)

Here, the vector n is the outward normal to Γ, ∂n is the normal derivative, the superscripts
± denote the limits for outside and inside Yi, and cm is a positive constant.

The membrane conductivity σm in (4) is described by diﬀerent models. In [7], Mir et al.

propose a static model based on

σm([u]) = σm0 + K (eβ[u] − 1),

(5)

for some constants σm0, K, and β, and used the model (1)-(4) and (5) as a boundary-value
problem for an elliptic equation with nonlinear transmission conditions at the membrane.

The classical and more involved model for σm due to Neu and Krassowska [14] is explained
in the following. It assumes that σm is the sum of σm0 and an electropermeabilization current.
The latter is proportional to the pore density N , which in turn is governed by an ordinary
diﬀerential equation:

σm([u], t) = σm0 + βN ([u], t)
N ([u], 0) = N0(x)

3. Wellposedness of the electropermeabilization model

In this section, we treat the classical electropermeabilization model model (1)-(4) and (6)-

(9) and study it in the form of an ODE on the membrane Γ.

As a preliminary step, let us prove the following representation of the pore density N .

Remark 1. In practice, it is clear that the potential v stays ﬁnite. One may therefore choose
a real number M > 0 and work instead of N (v, t) with the function

|v| ≤ M
M |v| > M
−M |v| < M

with vM :=

(15)

For (cid:107)v(cid:107)L∞(Γ) < M , this cutoﬀ preserves the pore density: NM (v, t) = N (v, t). In Lemma 3,
it is shown that the function v (cid:55)→ NM (v, t)vM , considered in C((0, T ); L2(Γ)), has a global
Lipschitz property.

Proof. The reduction of the time-dependent model on Ω to the initial value problem on Γ in
(16), using the Steklov-Poincar´e operators, is the same as in [8, Lemma 9]. The property in
(cid:3)
(ii) is shown in [8, Lemma 8].

For establishing existence and uniqueness results (in Theorem 1), we use the following

lemma on the Lipschitz property of the function NM introduced in Remark 1.
Lemma 3. Let M > 0, and let NM (v, t) = N (vM , t) with vM = sgn(v) min(|v|, M ) be the
modiﬁed pore density deﬁned by (15). Then

v (cid:55)−→ NM (v, t)vM

is global Lipschitz in C((0, T ); L2(Γ)).
Proof. Let v1, v2 ∈ C((0, T ); L2(Γ)). One has the algebraic identity
N (v1M , t)v1M − N (v2M , t)v2M =

(cid:0)N (v1M , t)v1M − N (v1M , t)v2M

(cid:1) +(cid:0)N (v1M , t)v2M − N (v2M , t)v2M

(cid:1).

(19)

Using the boundedness of vM , (19) shows that it suﬃces to prove that N (vM , t) is global
Lipschitz in C((0, T ); L2(Ω)).
Consider the explicit form of N (v, t) in (11). As (cid:107)vM(cid:107)L∞ ≤ M , there exists a constant

(cid:90) t

L(M ) such that

|N (v1M , t) − N (v2M , t)|2 ≤ L(M )

|v1(x, s) − v2(x, s)|2ds.

Therefore, we have

(cid:107)N (v1M , t)v1M − N (v2M , t)v2M(cid:107)C((0,T );L2(Γ)) ≤ C(M )(cid:107)v1 − v2(cid:107)C((0,T );L2(Γ)),

and the global Lipschitz property of NM in C((0, T ); L2(Ω)) holds.

Let us now state the well-posedness properties of our initial value problems on Γ.

Theorem 1. Let G ∈ C1((0, T ); H 1(Γ)) and ϕ ∈ H 2(Γ).

(i) The initial value problem in (22) has a unique global solution ˜v ∈ C([0, T ]; H 2(Γ)).
(ii) For the initial value problem (16), there is a t0 > 0 such that there exists a solution
(iii) The solution in (ii) is unique on C([0, t1], H 2(Γ)) for any closed interval [0, t1] ⊂ [0, t0[.

v ∈ C([0, t0[; H 2(Γ)).

TOWARDS MONITORING MICROSCOPIC PARAMETERS FOR ELECTROPERMEABILIZATION

Proof. (i): Let M > (cid:107)ϕ(cid:107)L∞ be a constant and consider the initial value problem (22). Fix a
number T > 0.
Due to the global Lipschitz property of NM vM shown in Lemma 3, one can apply the
ﬁxed point argument in [8, Thm.10]) to conclude that there exists a unique solution ˜v ∈
C([0, T ]; L2(Γ)) solving (22).
If one additionally assumes that G ∈ C1([0, T ]; H 1(Γ)) and ϕ ∈ H 2(Γ), then one can likewise
conclude ˜v ∈ C1([0, T ]; H 2(Γ)). Then we have that ∂nui ∈ L2(Γ). With such boundary regu-
larity, we infer ˜ui ∈ H 3/2(Yi), similarly ˜ue ∈ H 3/2(Ye). Then ˜v = ˜ue − ˜ui ∈ C([0, T ]; H 1(Γ)).
Using this argument once again, we have that ˜v = ˜ue − ˜ui ∈ C([0, T ]; H 2(Γ)).

(ii): We will now show that the solution ˜v to (22) found in point (i) solves locally the

original problem (16). – Using the Sobolev embedding theorem one has that

ΛcB−1˜v ∈ C([0, T ]; H 1(Γ)) (cid:44)→ C([0, T ]; C(Γ)).

Take a constant CM such that, for any t ≤ T , one has
˜vM + ΛcB−1˜v + G

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) σm(˜vM , t)

δ

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)C(Γ)

Then, for t ≤ t0, one gets

.

(cid:107)˜v(x, t)(cid:107)L∞(Γ) ≤ (cid:107)ϕ(cid:107)L∞ + tCM ,

≤ M.

But for (cid:107)˜v(cid:107)∞ < M , one has that ˜vM = ˜v and NM (˜v, t) = N (˜v, t). Therefore, the expressions
in (16) and (22) are the same, which implies that, locally, ˜v solves as well the original initial
value problem (16).

(iii): Take two solutions v, w to (16) in C1([0, t1], H 2(Γ)). Due to closedness of [0, t1] and
continuity of the norm (cid:107).(cid:107)H 2 → R, there exists a M > 0 such that for every t ∈ [0, t1], one
has

(cid:107)v(t)(cid:107)H 2 < M

and

(cid:107)w(t)(cid:107)H 2 < M.

But then the cutoﬀ with respect to M does not change the functions: vM = v and wM = w.
Therefore, v and w also solve (22). But for that ODE, one has a global uniqueness property.
(cid:3)
Therefore v = w on [0, t1].

cannot blow up in ﬁnite time (see Theorem 2).

We now give a more detailed analysis of the terms in equation (16) to show that a solution
Note that for σm given by (6), there exists a C ∈ R such that one has for all v that

(cid:104)σm(v, t)v, v(cid:105)L2 ≥ C(cid:107)v(cid:107)2
L2.

(23)

This immediately follows from the expression of the membrane conductivity in (6) and the
fact that both the pore density N as well as NM in (15) are positive.
Theorem 2. For a function v ∈ C1([0, t0[, L2(Γ)) which solves (16), it is impossible that

(cid:107)v(tk)(cid:107)L2(Γ) −→t→b ∞

for b ∈ [0, t0[.

8

H. AMMARI, T. WIDLAK, AND W. ZHANG

Proof. Take as an indirect assumption a blow up-sequence (cid:107)v(tk)(cid:107)X → ∞ with tk → b.
Without loss of generalization, we may choose tk ∈ [0, t0[ ∩ W , where W is a neighborhood of
b such that v is nonzero on [0, t0[ ∩ W . Due to the C1-regularity property of v(t) and v (cid:54)= 0,
the function

[0, t0[ ∩ W → R :

t (cid:55)−→ (cid:107)v(t)(cid:107)L2

is then continuously diﬀerentiable.

The sequence tk → b(x) having the Cauchy property, the slope of the secants satisﬁes

|(cid:107)v(tk+1)(cid:107)−(cid:107)v(tk)(cid:107)|

−→ ∞,

as well. We then will work with a sequence τk such that
∂t(cid:107)v(τk)(cid:107)L2 −→ ∞,

chosen by the mean-value theorem.

Consider equivalently to (16) the equation

(24)

σ(v)v = G − Cm∂tv − ΛcB−1v.

Take the L2-scalar product with v and take account of (cid:104)∂tv, v(cid:105) = (cid:107)v(cid:107) ∂t(cid:107)v(cid:107). Then estimate
the right-hand side with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the accretivity property (18):

(cid:104)σ(v)v, v(cid:105)L2 = (cid:104)G, v(cid:105)L2 − Cm(cid:104)∂tv, v(cid:105)L2 − (cid:104)ΛcB−1v, v(cid:105)L2,

≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107)L2(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2 − Cm(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2 ∂t(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2.

Divide by (cid:107)v(cid:107)L2 to ﬁnd

(cid:104)σ(v)v, v(cid:105)2

(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2

≤ (cid:107)G(cid:107)L2 − Cm∂t(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2.

(25)

From (23), we already know that the left-hand side stays positive.
Evaluate then expressions in inequality (25) for the sequence τk in (24). The result is that
the right-hand side would tend to −∞, which is impossible. This shows that no blow up of v
(cid:3)
in L2 can occur.

4. Homogenization

Let Ω be a bounded domain in R2, which carries a periodic structure made up by periodic
open sets εY . The reference domain Y = Yi ∪ Ye ∪ Γ contains a cell inside with membrane Γ,
where Yi is the intracellular domain and Ye is the extracellular domain. The whole domain Ω
is thus composed of

Ω = Ω+ ∪ Ω− ∪ Γε,

where Ω+ is the collection of extracellular domains, Ω− is the collection of intracellular do-
mains and Γε is the collection of membranes.

We write the thickness of the membrane of the cells εY in the form

δ = ε δ0,

where  is the scale of the cell and δ0 is the reference cell membrane thickness for Y .

As in [3], we want to study behavior of the electrical ﬁeld on this cell cluster and recover
features of the microscopic cell model from tissue measurements. Considering the cell model

For now, let us formally assume that the solution uε of (26) has the form

uε(x, t) = u0(x, t) + εu1(x,

, t) + o(ε).

(30)

We will calculate the equation for u0 in Subsection 4.1 and then prove rigorously that uε
converges in an appropriate sense to u0 in Subsection 4.2.

4.1. Formal calculation of the homogenization limit. To ﬁnd the precise form of the
terms in the ansatz (30), we can apply the arguments developed in [2]. For this end, it is
required that for the membrane conductivity one has that

σm(0, t) = constant.

(see [2, Secs. 3.2 and 3.3]). This condition can be ensured for the model (6), together with
(8): From (11), one can prove that N (0, t) = N0, and therefore σm(0, t) = constant.

Before calculating the limit, we ﬁrst give some deﬁnitions. Introduce the transform

The proof relies on arguments developed in [2]. For the sake of a readability, we outline
them in the appendix, and only prove here the crucial lemma needed for their adaption to
our case.

Lemma 4. For M > 1, there exists a constant C(M ) such that

Proof. We have

By the explicit form of N (v, t) in (11) and |vM|L∞ ≤ M , there exists a constant L(M ) such
that

and σm([uε]M , t) ≤ C(M ).

Together with the fact that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:82) T

|N ([uε]M , t) − N (0, t)|2 ≤ L(M )

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤(cid:82) T

In the preceding section, we have modeled macroscopic processes as homogenized quantities
In this section we show the sensitivity of the

eﬀective parameters to microscopic properties relevant in electropermeabilization.

We use FEM with mesh generator [17] to implement all the numerical simulations. We
present the numerical experiments from two aspects: First we will simulate the single cell
model (16) and show the electropermeabilization at cell level. Next we show how the micro-
scopic parameters aﬀect eﬀective parameters and anisotropy properties in the homogenized
model (32).

5.1. Electropermeabilization simulation for a single cell. We simulate the single cell
model (16) in a square domain [0, L] × [0, L], the cell is a circular in the center of the square
with cell radius r. The parameter β in (8) is given by

β =

2πr2
pσpδ
πrp + 2δ

.

(38)

All the parameters are given in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the results for the time evolution and
the voltage after 2 µs(cid:48).

5.2. Homogenization for electropermeabilization model. In this section, we show the
sensitivity of the eﬀective parameters σ0, A0, and A1 in (32) to

• the conductivities σo and σi;
• the shape of the cell with membrane Γ;
• the volume fraction f = vol(Yi)
vol(Y ) ;
• the lattice of the cells in the domain Ω.

We perform four experiments, the results of which are found in Table 2.

Example 1. We ﬁx the shape and size of the cell and change the ratio of the interior and

exterior conductivities σi and σe.

Example 2.

In this example, we show how the shape of the cell membrane produces
diﬀerent eﬀective anisotropy properties. We ﬁx conductivities and the volume fraction of the
cell, but take as cell shapes ellipses with diﬀerent excentricity a/b.

Example 3. We investigate the eﬀect of diﬀerent volume fractions of a cell with the same

shape.

14

H. AMMARI, T. WIDLAK, AND W. ZHANG

Example 4. In this example, we show how the angle of the lattice in which the cells are

arranged aﬀects the eﬀective parameters.

For all these experiments, Table 2 presents the reactions of the eﬀective conductivity σ0
and the eﬀective anisotropy properties A0 and A1(0) to the microscopical change. One sees
clearly that σ0, as well as A0 and A1 react to a change of cell and conductivity parameters.
Most of the sensitivity functions are in fact monotonic.

The best contrast is seen in:

• the reaction of σ0 to the change in conductivity σi/σe and to a change in the lattice
• the reaction of both A0 and A1 to the cell shape.

angle φ;

The volume fraction alone does not show so much contrast in the anisotropy of the eﬀective
parameters.

Given the results of the sensitivity analysis, it is promising to infer shape parameters
from macroscopic eﬀective properties in electropermeabilization, as it was done in [3] from
multifrequency admittivity measurements.

6. Concluding remarks

We introduced a homogenization scheme relating critical microscopic and macroscopic
quantities in electropermeabilization. The sensitivity analysis of the eﬀective parameters
showed this dependence and opens the door to solve the inverse problem to monitor those
critical microscopic quantities in practice.

While setup optimization for electropermeabilization has been studied using computer sim-
ulations, for instance, in [12, 20, 5, 13, 11], from our approach comes an additional constraint:
for mapping of the eﬀective parameters A1 and A0, two currents have to be applied which
are nowhere parallel. An electrode conﬁguration providing this allows for unique reconstruc-
tion [9].

Appendix A. Convergence for homogenization

We give here the outline of the method used in [2]. It shows how Lemma 4 is used to prove

Theorem 3 for our application.

Theorem 4. For the solution uε in (26) and the homogenized solution u0 in (32), we have
the convergence

The limits of K1ε and K2ε are the same as in [2, p.18], whereas for the limit K3ε, one can
show that K3ε → 0 by Lemma 4. One can take then the limit ε → 0 in (41) in order to obtain
information on the speciﬁc form of the limit u0 in (39). We get

actually (32) is the correct equation of the limit u0.
