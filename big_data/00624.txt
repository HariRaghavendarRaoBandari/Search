The statistics and origin of the ﬁrst discrete plastic event in a one dislocation dynamics simulation
are studied. This is done via a linear stability analysis of the evolving dislocation conﬁguration up
to the onset of irreversible plasticity. It is found, via a fold catastrophe, the dislocation conﬁguration
prior to loading directly determines the stress at which the plastic event occurs and that between
one and two trigger dislocations are involved. The resulting irreversible plastic strain arising from
the instability is found to be highly correlated with these triggering dislocations.

INTRODUCTION

The transition from elastic to macroscopic plastic de-
formation in metals is a discrete process mediated by
intermittent dislocation activity. Historically, such dis-
crete plastic activity was seen in bulk metallic systems
by Beeker and Orowan1 and later by Tinder and co-
workers2,3 who used a torsion device, with ultra-high
strain resolution, to show that plasticity well below yield
was characterized by discrete plastic events separated by
regions of near perfect elasticity. Modern developments
in the instrumentation of a deformation experiment have
allowed this phenomenon to be studied in more detail.
For example, intermittent plasticity is routinely seen via
in nano-identation as a “pop-in” event4,5 and in the ﬂat-
punch indention of a focus-ion-beam milled micron-sized
crystal, as ﬁrst introduced by Uchic and co-workers6.

One interesting aspect of the above phenomena is
that as the size of the plastically deforming region re-
duces the stress scale at which the discrete plasticity
occurs increases. Such an eﬀect is best known through
the paradigm of “smaller-is-stronger”, ﬁrst coined in the
micron-deformation experiments of ref.6 (see ref.21 and
references therein). A size eﬀect in the pop-in stress as
a function of spherical indenter size has also been seen
in refs.4,5. For the case of the micron-deformation ex-
periments, the understanding of the smaller-is-stronger
eﬀect has primarily focused on new dislocation based
mechanisms becoming operative as the plastically de-
forming volume reduces — mechanisms that depend ex-
plicitly on the presence of open boundary conditions —
see ref.22 and references therein. Despite the possibil-
ity of a change-of-mechanism approach, it has long been
recognised that with decreasing sample size, the overall
evolution of deformation becomes increasingly stochastic
with particular realizations of nominally similar deform-
ing volumes exhibiting a range of responses. Indeed, this
aspect has been used to explain the size eﬀect in nano-
indentation5, where only for the very smallest indenter
sizes a change in mechanism was needed23.

Under the assumption that the general size-eﬀect still
involves bulk plasticity mechanisms, the present authors
have employed an extreme-value statistics approach to
rationalize a size eﬀect in the stress scale at which discrete
plasticity occurs24–26. More recently, this framework has
been applied to study the statistics of the critical stress
at which the very ﬁrst plastic event occurs27. This was
done for the experimental nano-indentation data of Mor-
ris et al5 and a simpliﬁed dislocation dynamics simulation
under periodic boundary conditions11.

In ref.27, the statistics of the stress at which the ﬁrst
plastic event occurs is described by the extreme value
statistics of a master distribution of critical stresses, P [σ],
which characterizes the initial plastic response of the ma-
terial. Within this framework, the material admits M
plastic events whose corresponding critical stresses are re-
alized by sampling P [σ], M times — the lowest of which
is associated with the ﬁrst plastic event. This stress value

P [σ]. M is expected to be linearly proportional to the
deforming volume LD, and via, M = ρLD, deﬁnes a den-
sity ρ of plastic events the material can admit. Here D is
the spatial dimension of the deforming volume. Assum-
ing that P [σ] ∼ σ(1−γ)/γ as σ approaches zero, for large
enough L (or M ), Eqn. 1 limits to M × P [σ∗] × dσ ∼

Such a power-law relation is expected for asymptoti-
cally large M . Ref.27 found Eqn.2 to hold for the
stress at which the ﬁrst “pop-in” event occurs in a nano-
indentation experiment, as a function of indenter volume,
and also for the stress at which the ﬁrst discrete plastic
event occurs in one dimensional dislocation simulations.

The goal of the present paper is to investigate the origin
of this result for the latter one dimensional dislocation
model.

Sec. II outlines the one dimensional dislocation dynam-
ics model used for the present study and sec. III contains
a detailed investigation of the origin of the statistical
properties of the critical stress and plastic strain asso-
ciated with the ﬁrst plastic event. This is done by lin-
earising the dislocation equations of motion and study-
ing the properties of the resulting dynamical matrix as a
function of applied external shear stress until the critical
stress is reached.
It is found the corresponding eigen-
modes are spatially localized, indicating the eigenmode
eventually responsible for the onset of the ﬁrst plastic
event always involves a low number (usually one) of dis-
locations. For this eigenmode a simple relation exists
between its eigenvalue prior to loading and the critical
stress of the ﬁrst plastic event, which may be understood
within the framework of catastrophe theory. These two
results demonstrate the statistics of the ﬁrst critical stress
are related to the statistics of the lower end of the eigen-
value spectrum of the dynamical matrix. By analysing
the resulting irreversible plastic strain, it is found that
in most cases the resulting plasticity spatially correlates
with the structure of the unstable mode which triggers it.
Sec. IV discusses these results in the context of eigenvalue
perturbation theory which, via the fold catastrophe, di-
rectly relates the statistical properties of the dynamical
matrix elements, its eigenvalues and that of the ﬁrst crit-
ical stress into one uniﬁed picture. It concludes with a
brief summary and discussion on the possible generality
of these ﬁndings.

II. DISLOCATION DYNAMICS MODEL

A one dimensional conﬁguration of N inﬁnitely long
and straight edge dislocations is considered within the
periodic interval [0, d). Each dislocation (with Burgers
vector along the line) interacts via a long range elastic in-
teraction and also experiences a sinusoidal internal stress
ﬁeld of amplitude τ0 and period λ0. In this model, the
explicit dislocation content may be viewed as the mo-
bile dislocation population, whilst the internal ﬁeld rep-
resents a static mean-ﬁeld description of the immobile
dislocation population. For further details see refs.11,27.
d will be referred to as the size of the system. The present
work will consider a regime of large enough sizes such
that a change of size will not fundamentally aﬀect the
nature of the plasticity, but only aﬀect the statistics of
how d → ∞ bulk plasticity is probed. This viewpoint
will break down for small enough d where the choice of
boundary conditions do matter — a regime which is not
investigated in the present work.

The (over-damped) equation of motion for the ith dis-

2

location is given by

B

dxi
dt

= Fi[σ] = (σe [xi] + σ) b +Xj

f [xi − xj] ,

(3)

where b is the Burgers vector magnitude, B is the damp-
ing coeﬃcient, and σ is the applied external stress. In
the above, the static internal stress ﬁeld is given by

σe [x] = τ0 cos(cid:20) 2πx
λ0 (cid:21) ,

(4)

and the force between two dislocations seperated by a
distance x is given by

f [x] =

Gb2

2π(1 − ν) ×

π
d

coth πx
d i .

(5)

In the above, G is a shear modulus and ν is Poisson’s
ratio. Eqn. 5 is based on the isotropic elastic interaction
between two edge dislocations of inﬁnite length with par-
allel line directions, and has already been lattice summed
(see appendix of ref.11)— it therefore has a range of d/2.
In the limit of d → ∞, Eqn. 5 limits to ∼ 1/x.
The present work considers how the dislocation conﬁg-
uration responds to an increasing external stress σ via the
static condition Fi[σ] = 0 for i = 1 to N . As a numerical
simulation, this entails Eqn. 3 is numerically evolved un-
til all forces on the dislocation network are zero, for each
small increment of σ. The resulting conﬁguration is then
identiﬁed with the current external stress value σ. The
resulting plastic strain associated with this relaxation is
deﬁned as

δε =

δxi,

b

dhXi

(6)

which is based on a simpliﬁed Elshelby picture of the far-
ﬁeld strain signature due to a localized plastic event30. In
the above, h is an arbitrary length representing the width
of the one dimensional medium in which the dislocations
exist, with the product hd being its two dimensional vol-
ume of the deforming material — see ref.11. Note that
for this model, both the external and internal stresses, as
well as the resulting plastic strain have only a pure shear
component.

Following refs.11,27, the initial dislocation conﬁgura-
tion at zero loading is produced by placing N disloca-
tions at random positions within the [0, d) interval and
relaxing the system to its zero-force conﬁguration. This
then will be referred to as the initial conﬁguration prior
to loading.

III. RESULTS

A. Plastic evolution to the ﬁrst discrete plastic

event

In what follows, a system of size d = 1280 µm is con-
sidered with N = 640 dislocations, τ0 = 10MPa and

λ0 = 2µm. Following, ref.11, this can be viewed as repre-
senting a Cu crystal (b = 2.55 ˚A) with a dilute immobile
and mobile dislocation content. The stress versus plastic
strain curve, up to and including the ﬁrst plastic event,
for a particular initial dislocation conﬁguration is dis-
played in Fig. 1a. The plastic evolution is characterized
by an initial linear and reversible regime of plasticity fol-
lowed by a strongly non-linear regime prior to the ﬁrst
discrete (and irreversible) plastic event — the plateau re-
gion of the curve The ﬁgure shows the stress versus plas-
tic strain evolution until arrest of this ﬁrst irreversible
plastic event. Such a response is typical, with the gradi-
ent of the linear regime varying little with respect to the
starting dislocation conﬁguration.

The linear regime prior to the instability, seen in
Fig. 1a, suggests a linearization of Eqn. 3 should de-
scribe the initial linear plastic response. By writing the
initial zero load dislocation conﬁguration as {x0
i}, and
its response to an external stress as {xi = x0
i + ui}, the
linearization of Eqn. 3 at zero force is

where the last equalities are written in terms of the

˜Λun = enun. It is noted that the eigenvalues have units
of stress. Using the zero load conﬁguration of Fig. 1a,
the prediction of Eqn. 10 is also plotted, showing good
agreement for the linear plastic regime prior to the ﬁrst
discrete plastic event.

Eqn. 16 embodies a simple theory of linear anelasticity
in which reversible plastic deformation results in a re-
duced eﬀective elastic stiﬀness. The above constitutes a
mathematical description of a regime of plastic activity
recently studied in the context of quasi-reversible defor-
mation occuring between regimes of plasticity character-
ized by universal avalanche phenomenon32.

A similar linearlization procedure can be performed at
any step along the deformation curve by taking the lo-
cally relaxed coordinates from the numerical solution to
Eqn. 3, at a given applied external stress, to give ˜Λ[{xσ
i }].
Indeed, the proportionality factor between plastic strain
and the stress perturbation in Eqn. 10 gives directly the
inverse of the gradient of the simulated plastic deforma-
tion curve at the chosen applied external stress.

Fig. 1b plots the distribution of eigenvalues obtained
from the dynamical matrix evaluated for the dislocation
conﬁguration prior to loading and just before the occur-
rence of the discrete plastic event. The distributions show
only minor overall diﬀerences for the plastic evolution to
the instability. Fig. 1c plots the corresponding low-end
regime of eigenvalues as a function of eigenmode label,
showing the very lowest eigenvalue approaches zero close
to the instability, with the other eigenvalues either in-
creasing or decreasing with respect to their initial value.
This trend is found to be generally true and results in
Eqns. 9 and 10 diverging at the instability, indicating a
breakdown of the linearization approach and a divergent
gradient of plastic strain with respect to applied external
stress.

Eqn. 9 reveals the displacement vector u,

in which
the ith element represents the displacement of the ith
dislocation, arises from a weighted sum of the eigen-
modes. Since the weight for the nth eigenmode is in-
versely proportional to its eigenvalue, as the instability is

approached, the displacement vector is increasingly dom-
inated by the eigenmode with the lowest eigenvalue. In-
spection of the non-vansishing elements of this eigenmode
therefore gives insight into those dislocations responsible
for the instability.

To obtain an estimate of the number of dislocations
involved in an eigenmode, the participation number33 is
used:

PNn = Xi

[un]4

i!−1

,

(17)

which gives a value of unity when all but one element of
the normalized eigenvector is equal to zero, and a value
of N when each element has a value of 1/√N . Fig. 1d
plots the participation number of all eigenvectors for the
dynamical matrix evaluated at both zero load and at a
stress just prior to the instability. The ﬁgure demon-
strates only a few dislocations are involved in each eigen-
vector and those with the very lowest eigenvalues involve
approximately one dislocation. Thus, in this case, the
unstable mode involves only one dislocation as the trig-
ger to subsequent plastic activity. This result is found to
be generally true.

Fig. 2a displays the six lowest eigenvalues as a function
of applied stress derived from diagonalization of ˜Λ[{xσ
i }].
For this particular starting conﬁguration, it is seen that
the mode associated with the second lowest eigenvalue
prior to loading eventually leads to the instability of the
ﬁrst discrete plastic event. Thus the two lowest eigen-
values of the initial and unstable dynamical matrices in
Fig. 1c have interchanged eigenmodes.

The functional form of the eigenvalue’s external stress
dependence (in Fig. 2a) for the mode associated with the
instability is very well described by the functional form

e∗[σ] = e∗[0]r1 −

σ
σc

,

(18)

suggesting a fold catastrophe34,35 is at play — a feature
that has also been seen in multi-dimensional potential
energy landscapes of glassy materials36,37.

To investigate the generality of this result one thou-
sand loading simulations to the ﬁrst plastic event were
performed and for each, the lowest few eigenvalues were
determined as a function of external stress. Fig. 2b dis-
plays the scatter plot between the lowest eigenvalue at
zero loading versus its associated critical stress. Writing

Eqn. 18 as e∗[σ] = c√σc − σ, demonstrates if the fold
catastrophe relation would hold, then the upper bounds
of such a scatter plot should correspond to e∗[0] = c√σc.
That is, if the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to the unsta-
ble mode then it must be on the upper bound envelope
and if it is not, it must be below it. Inspection of the
ﬁgure, which also plots e∗[0] = c√σc versus σc for c de-
termined from the conﬁguration of Fig. 2a, clearly shows
that such a functional form does hold. A somewhat more
direct approach is to plot the eigenvalue corresponding to
the initial eigenmode with the highest overlap with the
unstable eigenmode. Fig. 2b plots this data (in green)
and again demonstrates the close adherence to the fold
catastrophe relation. The origin of the outlier points
above and below the fold catastrophe curve will be dis-

to the case of k = 0 in which the ordered array responds

B. Origin of the eigenvalue spectrum of the

dynamical matrix

The current results are related to the way a starting
conﬁguration is selected — N dislocations are randomly
placed within the interval [0, d) and relaxed to a local en-
ergy minimum. The energy of this disordered dislocation
conﬁguration is higher than the global energy minimum
for the current model and thus the starting conﬁguration
can be viewed as being out of equilibrium. The rational
for this choice is that the mobile dislocation content of
a material system is not expected to be close to equi-
librium14, since it forms only a small part of the total
dislocation content — the other part being that of the
immobile dislocation content (which in the current model
is represented via Eqn. 4). Whether or not the total dis-
location content can be understood within an equilibrium
or out-of-equilibrium framework remains a topic of con-
tinued debate14,38.

For the current model and choice of its parameters (in
particular N = d/λ0) the global energy minimum is an
ordered array of N dislocations with a “lattice constant”
equal to λ0. This conﬁguration, and variations from it
give insight into both the form of the eigenvalue spectrum
shown in Fig. 4b and some aspects of deformation. Be-
cause of the discrete translation symmetry of this conﬁg-
uration, the corresponding linearized matrix for d → ∞
may be exactly diagonalized, giving the eigenvalue,

ek = σ′

eb + A(cid:18) π2

3 −(cid:0)Li2(cid:2)eikλ0(cid:3) + Li2(cid:2)e−ikλ0(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:19) , (19)

with the label, k, being a one dimensional reciprocal
space vector whose value is between ±π/λ0. The corre-
sponding eigenvector is [uk]j ∼ exp(ikλ0j) where j labels
the jth dislocation. In the above A = Gb2/(2π(1− ν)λ0),
Li2 [·] is the poly-logarithm (Jonqui`ere’s function) of or-

and a simple fold catastrophe as σ → τ0.
The analytical eigenvalue distribution of Eqn. 19 is
schematically shown in Fig. 3a, and also evaluated nu-
merically for the d = 1280 µm system in Fig. 3b (shown
in red), along with the eigenvalue spectrum characteristic
of the initial dislocation conﬁgurations used in sec. III.
Fig. 3b therefore demonstrates the second peak of this
latter distribution arises from ﬁnite segments of ordered
dislocations, which the participation number data of
Fig. 1d show to involve up to eight dislocations.

The above approach can be extended to consider the
case of two dislocations within every second λ0 inter-
val. The corresponding eigenvalue spectrum is shown
in Fig. 3b (shown in green), giving rise to two peaks,
one of which may be viewed as an “acoustic branch”
and the other (higher eigenvalue) peak as an “optical
branch” since in this case the unit cell is of length 2λ0.
Again there is a good correspondence to two peaks of the
eigenvalue spectrum characteristic of the initial disloca-
tion conﬁgurations. Other ordered conﬁgurations may be
used to gain understanding of the remaining peaks.

C. Size eﬀects in critical stress and catastrophe

theory

To investigate how the critical stress and associated
eigenvalue spectrum might depend on system size, ten
thousand loading simulations are performed for d = 640,
320, 160 and 80 µm for the same dislocation density as
the d = 1280 µm system studied so far. Data for d = 2560
and 5120 µm is also shown. Fig. 4a plots the mean
critical stress versus the inverse of the system length
along with a ﬁt to an exponentially truncated power law:
exp(−l/d)/dγ, giving an exponent of γ ≈ 0.9. The value
of γ diﬀers slightly from that of ref.27, which derived its
parameters using a ﬁxed (high) strain rate loading mode.
The value of the exponent γ gives a low-stress power-law
exponent for the master critical stress distribution equal
to (1 − γ)/γ ≈ 0.11. Ref.27 found that the weak expo-
nential truncation can arise from deviations away from
the Weibull limit of asymptotically large M .

arising from an additional higher order term of the potential

Fig. 4b displays the average eigenvalue spectrum of the
dynamical matrix associated with the dislocation conﬁg-
uration prior to loading, for the case of d = 1280 µm and
d = 80 µm, and demonstrates that overall it changes lit-
tle for the system sizes so far considered suggesting there
is little fundamental diﬀerence in the nature of the ﬁrst
plastic event for system sizes down to d = 80 µm.

Fig. 4c displays a log-log scatter plot of the lowest
eigenvalue versus the associated critical stress for all con-
sidered systems sizes less than d = 1024 µm. Again, a
distinct upper bound limit clearly exists and for small
enough critical stresses it follows Eqn. 18, which is also
plotted in the ﬁgure. For larger stresses, the relation
between the unstable eigenvalue and the critical stress
appears to deviate from this fold catastrophe form — a
trend that is best seen in the linear plot of the same data,
Fig. 4d. To address this aspect, the details of catastrophe
theory must be considered.

Catastrophe theory classiﬁes the way in which a poten-
tial energy landscape approaches an instability34–36. The
simplest of these is the so-called fold catastrophe36,37,
whose potential energy landscape as the instability is ap-

ues) equalling e(3)

Here x parametrizes the last remaining relevant coor-
dinate and δ is the external stimulus, which in our
case is σ − σc. The minimum and maximum station-
ary points, this equation characterizes, are at x(3)
± =
±pBδ/A with the corresponding curvatures (eigenval-
± = ±2√ABδ. The barrier energy at
ﬁnite δ then becomes ∆U (3) = 2p2(Bδ)3/(9A). The so-

called fold ratio 6∆U (3)/(e(3)
− )2) is equal to unity
when these relations are maintained. e(3)
− gives directly
Eqn. 18. These relations are formally only valid in the
limit of the σ → σc. The present work shows however
that for d = 1280 µm, the fold catastrophe relation is
followed very well for the stress interval [0, σc). The ap-
plicability of the fold relations for non-negligible ﬁnite
values of σ−σc = δ has also been seen in atomistic simula-
tions of stressed model amorphous solids37, for which the
material instability is an atomic scale structural transfor-
mation.

where D = C/A3 is the remaining free parameter of
Eqn. 23. For an appropriate choice of D, Eqn. 26 evalu-
ated at σ = 0 is able to describe the relationship between
critical stress and corresponding unstable mode eigen-
value for the entire considered applied external stress
range — see Fig. 4d, which plots Eqn. 26 at σ = σc as a
dashed curve. Here D (and therefore C) must be negative
reﬂecting the fact that the maximum of Eqn. 26 occurs
at a stress σmax deﬁned by e(3)

+ [σmax] =p−5/(9D), and

is equal to p−8/(27D).

Fig. 5a plots the resulting potential energy landscape
for both the fold and O(5) fold catastrophe, demonstrat-
ing that such a 5th order term in Eqn. 23 does not funda-
mentally change the nature of the instability, only chang-
ing the position and curvature of the local minimum and
corresponding saddle-point. Inspection of Fig. 5b, shows
however that due to these modiﬁed stationary points, the
fold ratio36, which is identically one for the usual fold
catastrophe, can deviate by up to 20% for ﬁnite applied
external stresses.

D. Structure of the dynamical matrix

Further insight may be gained by inspecting the statis-
tical properties of the dynamical matrix Λij. In what fol-
lows, the labelling refers to a sequential list of dislocations
with increasing initial position. Thus the nearest neigh-
bour dislocations of the ith dislocation, barring periodic
boundary conditions, have the labels i − 1 and i + 1. All
statistics are derived from the d = 1280 µm system size.
Fig. 6a plots the mean of Λi,i+∆i and reveals that Λij
is predominantly tri-diagonal with positive diagonal ele-
ments and negative oﬀ-diagonal elements. Fig. 6b plots
normalized histograms of these diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal
band elements.

From Eqn. 8 there exist two contributions to each di-
agonal element of the dynamical matrix, the contribu-
tion arising from the elastic interaction between dislo-
cations and the contribution arising from the internal
static stress ﬁeld. For the single slip system considered
here, the former will always contribute positively to the
diagonal element due to the mutual repulsion between
dislocations, whereas the latter can either be positive or
negative depending on the location of the corresponding
dislocation. Detailed inspection reveals two classes of en-
vironments which lead to two distinct dislocation contri-
butions, one arising from regions in which there is more
than one dislocation within a λ0 interval and the other
arising from regions in which neighbouring dislocations

are spaced one per λ0 interval. This latter contribution
is responsible for the ﬁrst diagonal element peak in (the
green curve in Fig. 6b) whose location is similar to that
for the ordered conﬁguration (the red curve shown in
Fig. 3b). Such segments of order do not contribute to
the low-end tail of the diagonal elements of the dynam-
ical matrix. The second peak for the diagonal elements
in Fig. 6b arises from dislocation arrangements within a
single λ0 with its low-end tail being responsible for the
low-end tail of the diagonal element distribution. This
latter tail is due to the diﬀerent locations the disloca-
tions can take because of the static internal stress ﬁeld
and the surrounding dislocation structure. Inspection of
the spatial structure of the initial dislocation conﬁgura-
tions show that up to three dislocations can exist within
a λ0 interval.

Inspection of the negative oﬀ-diagonal elements show
approximately 60% of the elements are non-negligible
and centred around a value whose magnitude is approx-
imately half that of the diagonal elements. When this
is not the case, the value is at least an order of magni-
tude smaller. The origin of this oﬀ-diagonal structure is
best seen by inspection of Λij and the distance separat-
ing the dislocation pair xi − xj — Fig. 6c. It is seen a
large oﬀ-diagonal band element arises when a neighbour-
ing (or next nearest neighbouring) dislocation is within
the same λ0 interval, whereas the smaller elements arise
from neighbouring dislocations at more distant λ0 inter-
vals. The exponent of two in Fig. 6c is related to the
leading order, 1/r2, scaling of the oﬀ-diagonal element
(Eqn. 8).

where n = 0 for the diagonal and n = 1 for the oﬀ-
diagonal bands. In the above, Λij, equals the mean ijth
element and the average, h·ii, is with respect to i. Inspec-
tion of the ﬁgure reveals the matrix elements are only
signiﬁcantly correlated up to the second and third neigh-
bours.

The picture which emerges is of a predominantly tri-
diagonal matrix with oﬀ-diagonal band element values
having a non-negligible probability of being quite small.
Viewing this matrix to be precisely a tri-diagonal ma-
trix and with these small oﬀ-diagonal values to be iden-
tically zero results in a matrix of non-interacting smaller
block matrices. This is equivalent to truncating the
dislocation-dislocation interaction to a distance of ap-
proximately λ0. In this limit the origin of purely local-
ized eigenmodes becomes manifest, with the eigenmodes
consisting of dislocation bunches existing within one λ0
unit. Restoring the dislocation-dislocation interaction
to its full range results in a weak interaction between
the block matrices and therefore the possibility of more
spatially extended eigenmodes. That both the diagonal
and oﬀ-diagonal band elements are weakly correlated be-
yond three element indices, means that at a resolution
above that of the strongly interacting block matrices,
the full matrix is random. Such a random block tri-
diagonal matrix is similar as the one-dimensional random
potential problem and the physics of Anderson localiza-
tion39. In one dimension, the localization phenomenon
is robust against the strength of the disorder40, and —
barring any long-range correlations between the random
matrix elements (not suggested by Fig. 6d and the 1/r2
dependency of the oﬀ-diagonal elements) — are expected
to be localized as seen via the participation number in
Fig. 1d. Indeed, analysis of the level separation statistics
of the eigenvalues reveals strong Poisson behaviour (not
shown).

E. Relation between the emerging instability and

irreversible plastic strain

When the applied stress equals the critical stress of
the plastic event, the unstable eigenmode’s eigenvalue
becomes identically zero and the linearization procedure
breaks down. During the subsequent regime of strong
non-linearity, dislocations within the structure evolve ac-
cording to Eqn. 3, until a new stable dislocation con-
ﬁguration is found. At this point the plastic event has
entirely arrested and the linearization procedure can once
again be used. An interesting question is how related is
the resulting irreversible plasticity to the unstable mode
that triggers it?

ized histogram of the number of dislocations involved in the
plastic event obtained from the participation number of the
normalized plastic displacement vector (Eqn. 17). Data is de-
rived from approximately two thousand loading simulations
for a system size of d = 1028 µm.

To quantify the irreversible plasticity the dislocation
displacements (taking into account the periodic bound-
ary conditions) between the positions at the instability
and at arrest are found, giving a vector which is then nor-
malized. Taking the dot-product of this normalized plas-
tic displacement vector with the unstable mode gives the
overlap and therefore the degree of similarity between the
dislocations responsible for the trigger of plasticity and
those involved in the actual resulting plasticity. Such
an approach has been used to investigate a similar re-
lationship in hard-sphere glasses41 — see also ref.42 for
the case of magnetic reorientations in an XY spin glass.
Fig. 7a plots a histogram of this overlap measure derived
from several thousand loading simulations performed up
to the arrest of the ﬁrst plastic event for d = 1280 µm.
The histogram shows two distinct features, where in the
ﬁrst case, there exists a peak (marked in green) close to
an overlap of unity, demonstrating that approximately
82% of the plastic event structures are strongly related
to the unstable mode triggering the irreversible plastic-
ity. The remaining 18% percent of plastic events admit
a range of lower overlaps (marked in blue).

Given the eigenmode at the instability involves only
one dislocation (Fig. 1d), this result indicates 82% per-
cent of the plastic events are mediated by only the trig-
ger dislocation. This is conﬁrmed through inspection of
the participation number (Eqn. 17) of the plastic strain
vector. On the other hand, the participation number of
those plastic events which have a reduced overlap can
have a value ranging between one and ﬁve dislocations.
Fig. 7b plots a histogram of the participation number of
the plastic strain vector, in which the bin width is unity
and each bin is centred on an integer. The observed trend
my be rationalized by considering the probability, A, that
a dislocation involved in plasticity triggers another dislo-
cation to become mobile, and so on, giving a histogram
equal to An−1 where n is the nth dislocation involved in

the plastic event. Fig. 7b includes such a curve for the
optimal value of A = 0.113844, indicating a dislocation
involved in plasticity has the probability of ∼ 0.1 to trig-
ger another dislocation. This value is quite compatible
with the above observation that approximately 18% of
the plastic events have weak overlap with the unstable
eigenmode. The general trends shown here diﬀer little
for the considered system sizes down to d = 80 µm.

Past work has shown that the present model applied
to a dipolar mat geometry exhibits scale-free avalanche
behaviour only when the external stress is “tuned” to the
above yield stress11. The transition to macroscopic ﬂow
is thus characterized by a mean-ﬁeld depinning transi-
tion14,31 as discussed by Dahmen and co-workers16 — a
result that is also the case for the single slip plane system
studied presently. The ﬁrst irreversible plastic event is
therefore expected to not exhibit scale free avalanche be-
haviour, indeed the statistics of the plastic displacement
shown in Fig. 7b can not admit power law behaviour in
the plastic strain magnitude distribution because A < 1.
This should be compared when approaching yield, and
“tuned” criticality. Here, A → 1, and the plastic events
can involve a very large number of dislocations and there-
fore a divergent plastic strain.

IV. DISCUSSION

Further insight into the underlying mechanism of the
ﬁrst plastic event can be gained by investigating the dy-
namical matrix using second order eigenvalue perturba-
tion theory. Treating the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the dy-
namical matrix as a perturbation, Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger
gives the lowest eigenvalue as

e1 ≈ Λ11 +Xi6=1

|Λ1j|2
Λ11 − Λii

,

(28)

where Λ11 is the lowest diagonal element. The second
term is always negative since Λ11 < Λii. Two approaches
can be taken in assigning the labelling i in the above
equation. If the dominant term contributing to the sum-
mation arises from the second lowest diagonal element,
giving the smallest denominator, then i should reﬂect
the numerical order of the ith diagonal element. If, on
the other hand, the dominant term originates from the
largest oﬀ-diagonal element, giving the largest numera-
tor, then i should reﬂect the numerical order of the spa-
tial distance associated with the Λ1i diagonal element.
For the present case, it is the latter, so the largest contri-
bution always arises from the term with the largest oﬀ-
diagonal element and therefore the mode closest to the
spatial location of the dislocation associated with the Λ11
element. This originates from the block structure of the
matrix discussed in Sec. III D in which the ﬁrst plastic
event originates from conﬁgurations typically involving
two or three dislocations within the same λ0 unit. Be-
cause of this, the corresponding i = 2 diagonal mode Λ22
is considerably larger than Λ11.

Low end distributions of the dynamical matrix diagonals and

from ten thousand initial conﬁgurations for a system size of
d = 1028 µm.

Fig. 8a displays a scatter-plot of the lowest eigen-
value versus the lowest dynamical matrix diagonal for
d = 1280 µm. A strong band of linear correlation is
evident. The data is coloured according to the num-
ber of dislocations within the λ0 unit of the disloca-
tion associated with the lowest diagonal element. For
the case when the lowest eigenvalue involves two dislo-
cations, lowest order perturbation theory (Eqn. 28) is
suﬃcient to calculate the numerical value of the corre-
sponding eigenvalue. On the other hand, when three dis-
locations are involved, Eqn. 28, provides only a good es-
timate and higher-order perturbation theory is needed
to obtain an accurate eigenvalue due to the multiple
“scattering” associated with the two non-negligible oﬀ-
diagonal elements. Fig. 8a therefore demonstrates two
distinct dislocation environments are responsible for the
ﬁrst irreversible plastic event. It is noted that these two
mechanisms do not explain the two classes of overlap be-
tween the instability mode and the plastic displacement
considered in Sec. III E. This suggests the extent of the
resulting plasticity has more to do with the surrounding
dislocation structure than those dislocations triggering
the instability.

The average trend seen in Fig. 8a indicates the dis-
tribution of diagonal elements has a hard gap — ei ≈
Λii + ∆Λ — which may be estimated by the second term
of Eqn. 28. This result is also valid for higher value pairs
of diagonal elements and eigenvalues. If, P (e) ∼ eθ, then
the distribution of diagonal elements must be P (Λ) ∼
(Λ − ∆Λ)θ. What is the value of the exponent θ? The
existence of a fold catastrophe gives a direct connection
between the ﬁrst critical stress and the lowest eigenval-
ues of the dynamical matrix for the conﬁguration prior

to loading, e1 ∝ √σc, giving θ = (2− γ)/γ = 1.22 for the

value γ = 0.9 obtained via the average ﬁrst critical stress
versus system size (Fig. 4a). The observation that it is
not necessarily the lowest eigenvalue which is connected
to the critical stress via the fold catastrophe (see ﬁg. 2a)

only aﬀects the prefactor of the above scaling, and not
the scaling itself. This is because the level spacing of the
ﬁrst few eigenvalues scales with system size in the same
way as the lowest eigenvalue. Fig. 8b plots the eigen-
value and diagonal dynamical matrix distributions aver-
aged over 10000 initial conﬁgurations for a system size
of d = 1280 µm along with the corresponding power law
distributions (appropriately normalised) using the expo-
nent θ = 1.22 and the diagonal element gap (obtained
from Fig. 8a). Agreement is seen to be quite good with
some deviation close to the hard gap and for the very
smallest eigenvalues.

The presence of a gap may be seen without the aid
of perturbation theory.
In fact, to ensure the dynami-
cal matrix is positive deﬁnite (a necessary condition for
a stable dislocation conﬁguration), its components must

satisfy |Λij| ≤pΛiiΛjj where the diagonal elements are

positive non-zero numbers. This is a general result for a
positive deﬁnite matrix and originates from the property
that every principle sub-matrix of the matrix in ques-
tion must itself be positive deﬁnite, including all 2 × 2
sub-matrices. The above inequality then gives

(29)

Λ11 ≥ max

j (cid:8)|Λ1j|2/Λjj(cid:9) .

For the present system, this maximum is always due to
the jth diagonal element whose dislocation is closest to
dislocation ‘1’. For the case of the smallest possible value

of maxj(cid:8)|Λ1j|2/Λjj(cid:9), the inequality in Eqn. 29 limits

to an equality, giving the minimum possible value of
Λ11. Indeed, two separate equalities emerge associated
with the environments of either two or three dislocations.
That this minimum is a ﬁnite positive number is due
to a unique combination of the repulsive interaction be-
tween dislocations (the dislocations cannot be too close
to each other), the pinning eﬀect of the static internal
ﬁeld (which tends to bunch dislocations within a single
λ0 unit), and the surrounding dislocation environment.
The speciﬁc combination of these factors giving the ab-
solute minimum is only approached with a non-negligible
probability for large enough system sizes.

The arrows in Fig. 8b indicate the average lowest eigen-
value and the average lowest diagonal element, demon-
strating that they are well within the regime for which
the power law behaviour is dominant. This is to be ex-
pected given the approximately linear scaling between
the mean ﬁrst critical stress versus system size (Fig. 8a).
In fact the regime of eigenvalues below that of the hard
gap range corresponds (via the fold catastrophe relation)

10

to a critical stress of σc ≈ 0.0008τ0, which is well outside
the range of Fig. 4a. Despite this agreement, it is ex-
pected that for large enough system sizes, Weibull44–48
ﬂuctuations around the mean value will be aﬀected in
this stress regime: as was noticed for the system size,
d = 1280 µm, in Ref.27.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The present work has demonstrated the extreme value
statistics of the critical stress of the ﬁrst plastic event
in a one-dimensional dislocation dynamics model may be
associated with the low-end eigen-structure of the dy-
namical matrix of the dislocation conﬁguration prior to
loading. In particular the critical stress of a given dis-
location conﬁguration can be directly related, via a fold
catastrophe, to one of the lowest eigenvalues whose cor-
responding eigenmode will eventually facilitate the insta-
bility leading to the ﬁrst plastic event. Inspection of such
eigenmodes and the general statistical properties of the
dynamical matrix, reveal them to be localized, involving
generally only one to two dislocations. Thus, despite the
long range interaction between dislocations, the onset of
the very ﬁrst plastic event for the considered model is a
localized structure.
It is found that the internal static
stress ﬁeld (with its imposed length and stress scales)
plays a dominant role here.

It is an interesting question, if such a phenomenon may
be generalized to two and three spatial dimensions for dis-
location networks involving multiple active slip systems
and the general phenomenon of screening. In particular,
if the characteristic disorder a particular dislocation seg-
ment experiences due to all other dislocations is of a type
able to induce similar behaviour of the form seen here
will be a topic of future work. The work of ref.27 demon-
strates the extreme value statistics approach taken here
is applicable to experimental nano-indentation probes of
three-dimensional dislocation structure in real materials,
suggesting that this might in fact be the case. Further-
more, how this picture might change as a function of the
nth plastic event might give fundamental insight into the
more general nature of micro-plasticity, and the transi-
tion to macroscopic yield and plastic ﬂow.
