Cotunneling into Kondo systems, where an electron enters a f -electron material via a cotunneling
process through the local-moment orbital, has been proposed to explain the characteristic lineshapes
observed in scanning-tunneling-spectroscopy (STS) experiments. Here we extend the theory of
electron cotunneling to Kondo-lattice systems where the bulk hybridization between conduction and
f electrons is odd under inversion, being particularly relevant to Kondo insulators. Compared to the
case of even hybridization, we show that the interference between normal tunneling and cotunneling
processes is fundamentally altered:
it is entirely absent for layered, i.e., quasi-two-dimensional
materials, while its energy dependence is strongly modiﬁed for three-dimensional materials. We
discuss implications for STS experiments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Scanning tunneling spectroscopy has developed into a
powerful tool to investigate the surface electronic struc-
ture of both bulk and thin-ﬁlm materials. It provides a
spatially resolved map of the local single-particle density
of states. Moreover it has been used to derive information
on the momentum-resolved bandstructure via so-called
quasiparticle interference (QPI), i.e., energy-dependent
Friedel oscillations caused by dilute impurities.1–3 Re-
cently, such QPI analysis has been employed4–9 to con-
ﬁrm the spin–momentum locking of surface states of
topological insulators.10–12

In multiorbital systems, the proper interpretation of
tunneling spectra requires knowledge about individual
orbital tunneling matrix elements (or their ratios) which
are determined by the wavefunction overlaps between
electronic states in the tip and Wannier states in the
material. For Kondo systems,13 involving both weakly
correlated conduction electrons and local-moment f elec-
it has been proposed14,15 that both contribute
trons,
to STS spectra:
In addition to direct tunneling into
conduction states, cotunneling processes via localized
states can occur which involve a magnetic interaction be-
tween the tunneling electron and the local moment. The
quantum-mechanical interference between these two tun-
neling paths, together with the particle–hole (p-h) asym-
metry of the conduction band, leads to a characteristic
Fano-like lineshape in the STS signal.16–23 The interfer-
ence term itself is determined by the eﬀective coupling
between f and conduction electrons.

Importantly, frequently used model Hamiltonians as-
sume a spatially local Kondo interaction or hybridization
between local moments and conduction electrons, such
that, for Kondo-lattice systems with inversion symme-
try, the eﬀective momentum-space hybridization function
is even under inversion. However, in real materials the
Kondo interaction is not local, with its spatial structure
being determined by the overlap of the relevant orbitals.
In fact, in many inversion-symmetric Kondo-lattice sys-
tems the hybridization is odd under inversion – this ap-
plies in particular to topological Kondo insulators24–27
(TKIs) which have been in the focus of intense activities

recently. However, the interplay of odd hybridization and
cotunneling have not been studied before.

It is the purpose of this paper to study the eﬀects of
odd hybridization for cotunneling and STM spectra of
Kondo-lattice systems. As we will show, odd hybridiza-
tion forces the on-site propagator connecting conduction
and f electrons to vanish, which implies that the interfer-
ence between normal tunneling and cotunneling is absent
in the simplest tunneling models. Complications arise
from broken inversion symmetry near the surface as well
as from non-local tunneling processes, and we will discuss
the consequences for STS spectra.

II. TUNNELING CONDUCTANCE FOR

HEAVY-FERMION MATERIALS

captured by a Hamiltonian HT =(cid:80)

To set the stage, we review the cotunneling theory of
Refs. 14 and 15. The bulk system is described by oper-
ators for conduction electrons and f states, ciσ and ¯fiσ,
respectively; explicit Hamiltonians follow below. A spa-
tially local tunneling process between tip and surface is
σψ0σ + h.c. where
p is an electron operator for the tip, and ψ0 involves
both c and f electrons at site 0 below the tip. Impor-
tantly, Coulomb interactions on f orbitals are strong and
suppress charge ﬂuctuations, leading to cotunneling. In
a Kondo-model description, f electrons form local mo-
ments (cid:126)Si, and ψ0 can be expressed as14

ψ0σ = vcc0σ + (1/2)

¯vf,i((cid:126)τσσ(cid:48) · (cid:126)S0)ciσ(cid:48) .

Here, vc and ¯vf are the amplitudes for direct tunneling
and cotunneling, respectively, (cid:126)τ is a Pauli matrix, and i
represent the c electron site(s) which hybridize with the
f orbital at 0. In an alternative Anderson-model descrip-
tion, the f electrons become renormalized by Coulomb
interactions, which can be captured by a constant renor-
malization factor b at the mean-ﬁeld level, fiσ = b ¯fiσ,
with fiσ being auxiliary fermion operators.13 As a result,
the operator ψ0 takes the form14

ψ0σ = vcc0σ + vf f0σ .

III. HYBRIDIZATION AND INTERFERENCE

TERMS

2

Within the renormalized single-particle formulation,13
minimal bulk Hamiltonians for heavy-fermion metals as
well as topological insulators involve four bands (i.e. two
types of spin-degenerate orbitals) and can be written in
Bloch form

(cid:18) c(k) Vcf (k)

(cid:19)

Vf c(k)

f (k)

H(k) =

(6)

where all individual entries are 2 × 2 matrices in spin
(or pseudospin) space. Here,  and V denote kinetic-
energy and hybridization terms, respectively, all of them
representing interaction-renormalized quantities.13
Assuming inversion symmetry, we have c(k) = c(−k)
and f (k) = f (−k), while the hybridization can be even
or odd, Vcf (k) = ±Vcf (−k).
In particular, TKIs with
inversion symmetry24 are characterized by an odd hy-
bridization function, typically arising from conduction-
electron orbitals which are even under inversion (s or d)
and localized-electron orbitals which are odd (f ).

In all cases, the orbital-oﬀ-diagonal propagators obey:

Gcf (k) = G0
Gf c(k) = Gf (k)Vf c(k)G0

c(k)Vcf (k)Gf (k),
c(k)

(7)

(8)

where G0
c(k) is the Green’s function for c electrons when
V = 0, and all propagators are taken at the same ﬁxed
frequency ω. Given that G0
c and Gf are even under in-
version, Gcf and Gf c inherit the inversion eigenvalues of
Vcf and Vf c, i.e., odd (even) hybridization implies odd
(even) oﬀ-diagonal propagators.

The interference term in the tunneling conductance
(5) is determined by the local oﬀ-diagonal propagator
Gcf ≡ Gcf (r = r(cid:48)) where translation invariance has been
assumed. For an inversion-symmetric system with odd
hybridization, this vanishes:

(cid:90)

Gcf ≡

Gcf (k)dk = 0,

(9)

as a consequence of the integrand being odd in k – this
observation is central for the rest of the paper. Obviously
Gcf = 0 implies the absence of the interference term
in Eq. (5), and the tunneling lineshape needs to be re-
considered. While this analysis strictly applies to a lay-
ered, i.e., eﬀectively two-dimensional (2D), system where
the surface layer probed by STS displays bulk properties,
it must be modiﬁed for three-dimensional (3D) systems:
Here, translation and inversion symmetries are broken by
the surface, and an eﬀective local Gcf (cid:54)= 0 is created as
a consequence, such that the interference term of Eq. (5)
reappears. However, its energy dependence is distinct
from that in the case of even hybridization.

Figure 1. Schematic picture of cotunneling into a 3D heavy-
fermion material. Each site (yellow) consists of a conduction
c (red) and a localized f (blue) orbital. c describes the on-
site c energy, tc the NN c hopping, f the on-site f energy,
tf the NN f hopping, and V the NN c − f hybridization,
which can be local (top right), or non-local (bottom left).
The STM tip is described by its DOS ρtip. Electron tunnel
vertically from the tip into a c orbital with amplitude vc or
into a (renormalized) f orbital with amplitude vf .

The same renormalized single-particle formulation can
be obtained from the Kondo description, employing a
SU(N ) large-N limit and a mean-ﬁeld decoupling of the

Given HT , the tunneling conductance at voltage Φ is

(3)

where e is the electron charge,  Planck’s constant,
ρtip the density of states of the tip, assumed energy-
independent, and Gψ is the local energy-dependent
Green’s function for the operator ψ0. Using Eq. (2) we
have:

Gψ(ω) = v2

c Gc(ω) + v2

f Gf (ω) + vcvf [Gcf (ω) + Gf c(ω)]
(4)
where the propagators and tunneling amplitudes have
been assumed spin-independent, and the spin degeneracy
is taken into account in the prefactor of Eq. (3). Abbrevi-
ating ρ(ω) = − Im G(ω)/π the conductance is then given
by

g(eΦ) =

(5)

The mixed terms ρcf and ρf c, arising from the interfer-
ence of normal tunneling and cotunneling, typically in-
duce a distinct p-h asymmetry at low energies, leading
to a Fano-like lineshape for a single Kondo impurity and
to an asymmetric double-peak structure surrounding the
hybridization gap for a Kondo lattice.14

Figure 3.
Same as Fig. 2, but for a 2D TKI with odd hy-
bridization (12) close to p-h symmetry (exactly at p-h sym-
metry the system is metallic). Since ρcf is always zero, the
lineshape is here independent of the sign of vf /vc. Parameters
are c − f = −0.125Dc, V = 0.026Dc.

Figure 4. Same as Fig. 3 for a 2D TKI, but with strong p-
h asymmetry. This causes an asymmetric lineshape without
the need for an interference term (ρcf = 0). Parameters are
V = 0.04Dc, c − f = −0.5Dc.

chemical potential is placed inside the hybridization gap,
this yields a topologically trivial (or normal) Kondo in-
sulator (NKI). In this case ρcf = ρf c is in general non-
zero, peaked where most of the f states live, i.e.
just
above and below the gap, and zero in the gap. The sign
of ρcf is related to the fact that below (above) the gap
the (anti)bonding linear combination of c and f states
is created; in particular, at p-h symmetry, ρcf is odd in
ω: ρcf (−ω) = −ρcf (ω). Concrete results are in Fig. 2,
which illustrate an asymmetric tunneling signal arising
from the interference term ρcf .

The hybridization is V = 0.011Dc where Dc = 8tc is the c-
bandwidth. The vertical dashed lines denote the bulk gap
∆/Dc = 0.012, and the small weight inside it is due to ﬁnite
broadening δ/Dc = 2.5 × 10−4 used in the calculation.

IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

To conﬁrm and illustrate this reasoning, we have nu-
merically studied a number of 2D and 3D Kondo-lattice
models, the latter in a (001) slab conﬁguration to study
the surface tunneling spectrum.
In all cases, we work
in a single-particle formulation with ﬁxed renormalized
ignoring self-consistency13). This im-
parameters (i.e.
plies that we neglect material-dependent surface eﬀects,
i.e., reduced Kondo temperature or Kondo breakdown28
as well as surface reconstruction29 and dangling bonds,
polar charges, passivation, etc.

The examples include topologically trivial and non-
trivial band structures, the latter corresponding to TKIs.
Given the non-interacting character of the eﬀective
models, diﬀerent electron concentrations can simply be
achieved by tuning the overall chemical potential, and
we will explicitly display ﬁgures for the Kondo-insulating
cases. For simplicity, we work on square (2D) or cubic
(3D) lattices, with kinetic-energy matrices of the form

B. 2D model, odd hybridization

where j = x, y in 2D and j = x, y, z in 3D. The nearest-
neighbor (NN) hopping is taken as tc > 0, tf < 0; in the
examples we will use tf /tc = −0.1. Numerical values for
c,f and V are chosen to ensure comparable bandwidths
and hybridization gaps in all cases.

A. 2D model, even hybridization

We start with simple 2D models representative for lay-
ered heavy-fermion materials. For the case of even hy-
bridization we choose a local, spin-independent version,

Vcf (k) = V 1

(11)

with V < 0; we similarly take spin-independent tunnel-
ing amplitudes, vc ≡ v↑

To demonstrate the eﬀect of odd hybridization in a
planar geometry, we choose a non-local, spin-dependent
hybridization of the form

Vcf (k) = −2iV (σx sin kx + σy sin ky),

(12)
and Vf c(k) ≡ [Vcf (k)]† = −Vcf (k) (Vcf (k) is antihermi-
tian). This model realizes a 2D TKI. Our speciﬁc choice
of the relative phase between conduction and localized
states (easily generalizable to 3D, see below) implies a
factor of i occurring in Vcf (12); moreover, the tunneling
between f orbitals and tip is along z with amplitudes

D. 3D model, odd hybridization

We now turn to the case of odd hybridization in 3D.
The simplest model24,30 for a TKI in 3D is obtained using
a hybridization matrix

Vcf (k) = −2iV (σx sin kx + σy sin ky + σz sin kz),(14)
and Vf c(k) ≡ [Vcf (k)]† = −Vcf (k); we will take V < 0.
The choice of relative phases of Wannier states yields real
hybridization terms in real space along the z direction.

The model described by Eqs.

(6), (10), (14) ad-
mits diﬀerent phases depending on the energy diﬀerence
c−f
24,30: when |c−f| > 6(|tc|+tf ), it realizes a topo-
logically trivial insulator, when |c − f| < 2(|tc| + tf ), it
realizes a weak topological insulator, otherwise a strong
topological insulator.

In Fig. 6 we present results in the weak topological
phase with two surface Dirac cones at the p-h-symmetric
point (c = f ), and in Fig. 7 in the strong topological
phase with one surface Dirac cone away from p-h sym-
metry. In both cases, in-gap spectral weight appears due
to the presence of topological surface states. We ﬁnd in
general ρcf (z, ω) = ρf c(z, ω) (cid:54)= 0 unless ρcf is measured
deep in the bulk, Figs 6(c) and 7(c). This may be inter-
preted as an eﬀective local even-hybridization term which
is generated by the presence of the surface. Consequently,
an interference term now appears in the tunneling con-
ductance. However, its energy dependence is found to be
completely diﬀerent from the even-hybridization case in
Fig. 5. Firstly, it has an appreciable weight in the gap
arising from the topological surface states; secondly, it
changes sign not in the gap, but for energies correspond-
ing to bulk f states: this happens twice for ρcf (z = 0, ω),
while ρcf (z > 0, ω) has in general more nodes.
In particular, in the p-h-symmetric case of Fig. 6,
ρcf (z, ω) is here an even function of energy, ρcf (z,−ω) =
ρcf (z, ω), while with even hybridization, as remarked, it
is odd. Even in absence of p-h symmetry, Fig. 7, the
overall behavior of ρcf (z, ω) does not change.

We have repeated the calculation in the topologically
trivial phase of the model;24 note that in this case an
insulator would be obtained even for zero hybridization,
since the c and f bands do not intersect when V = 0. As
shown in Fig. 8, we see that, given the same hybridiza-
tion as in Fig. 7, ρcf (z, ω) is much smaller here, and it
is zero in the gap due to the absence of surface states.
However, ρcf (z = 0, ω) changes sign in the f band and
not in the gap, in analogy to what happens in the topo-
logical non-trivial phase, and in contrast to the case with
even hybridization.

Taking the information from Figs. 6, 7, 8 together,
we can therefore attribute the occurrence of non-zero in-
gap weight of ρcf (z, ω) to topological surface states, and
speculate that its change of sign in the gap or in the f
band is due to even vs. odd hybridization.

As emphasized above, ρcf is strictly zero here, as
demonstrated in Eq. (9), while ρc and ρf are not qualita-
tively diﬀerent from the even-hybridization case, compare
Figs. 2(a) and 3(a). In the case of strong p-h asymme-
try, Fig. 4(a), the two peaks below and above the gap are
strongly asymmetric. For weakly coupled layers ρcf will
be non-zero but very small, such that the main conclu-
sions remain unchanged.

C. 3D model, even hybridization

For the 3D case, where STS can probe the surface but
not the bulk, we start again with the case of even hy-
bridization,

Vcf (k) = V 1.

(13)

We assume that the tip only probes the topmost layer,
i.e.,
in a slab calculation which yields ρ(z) we take

ing to Eq. (5). As in the 2D case we have vf ≡ v

and vc ≡ v↑

c .

The results from the slab calculation with even hy-
bridization, Fig. 5, show that the relevant quantities ρc,
ρf , and ρcf display a very weak dependence on the layer
index z; moreover they are similar to the 2D case, Fig.
2. As a consequence, neglection of surface eﬀects is a
reasonable approximation in this case, and a bulk theory
is still appropriate to approximately describe the surface.
We recall that self-consistency has been neglected: this
would take into account that Kondo screening is modi-
ﬁed near the surface compared to the bulk, but would
not change our conclusions concerning p-h asymmetries.

ρcf (z, ω) = ρcf (z,−ω); and ρcf depends strongly on the layer
index, being zero in the bulk, showing that a bulk description
of the surface is inadequate.

gap surface states are absent. Parameters are V = 0.021Dc,
c − f = 0.56Dc.

energy dependence arise from the ﬁnite thickness of the slab
(N = 30).

E. Toy model for SmB6

As a last example we provide results for a system with
three Dirac cones, which should mimic SmB6.31 To do
this, we modify the kinetic energy by introducing 2nd
NN hopping:

in a such a way to have a band inversion at the
three X points.31 Parenthetically, we note that this
simpliﬁed model has a surface spin structure in dis-
agreement with experiment32 due to incorrect mirror
Chern numbers,33,34 but this is largely irrelevant for the
spin- and momentum-integrated STS spectrum consid-

ered here. For this model, results are shown in Fig. 9
where we can observe the same general features that we
described for a TKI with one or two cones. However, here
one of the cones is inequivalent to the other two, with a
diﬀerent Dirac energy, hence we do not clearly observe
ρc,f,cf (z, ω) going to zero at the center of the cones.

V. STS LINESHAPE

The above discussion has consequences for the energy
dependence of the STS spectrum, i.e., the lineshape, and
the role of the tunneling paths in Kondo systems.
In
standard models for heavy-fermion materials, the phe-
nomenological parameters vc and vf aﬀect this lineshape:

ture eﬀects – except for the residual conductance in
the (pseudo)gap, which is due to some other conduc-
tion channel. A topological bandstructure model, such
as ours, naturally assigns this residual conductance to
topological surface states (but details are beyond our sim-
pliﬁed description).

The tunnelling theory used in this paper assumed
point-like tunneling between tip and surface. If the tip is
larger, we have to consider the non-local Green’s function
G(r, r(cid:48)), which can be non-zero even when G(r, r) = 0;
hence, our approach is only a starting approximation of
the phenomenon. As a general rule, in presence of trans-
lational symmetry Gcf (r − r(cid:48)) will have a node when
(r − r(cid:48)) = 0, in contrast to the even-hybridization case.
In Fig. 10 we show how ρcf depends on (r − r(cid:48)) in 2D,
with either even or odd hybridization.

Finally we note that a fully accurate description of the
tunneling signal requires the explicit use of the spatial
shape of the Wannier functions38, which, however, im-
plies more complicated numerical work which is beyond
the scope of this paper.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

For heavy-fermion systems with bulk inversion sym-
metry we have argued that a hybridization term which
is odd under inversion leads to the vanishing the local
non-diagonal term Gcf of the Green’s function. We have
shown that this strongly modiﬁes considerations concern-
ing the spectral lineshape as measured in STS experi-
ments, because the cotunneling interference term usu-
ally made responsible for the appearance of a Fano-like
lineshape is either absent or very diﬀerent from that in
the even-hybridization case. Sharp conclusions can be
drawn for p-h-symmetric bands, where even hybridiza-
tion generically leads to a p-h-asymmetric STS signal, its
asymmetry being entirely due to Gcf , and odd hybridiza-
tion to a strictly p-h-symmetric lineshape. In a general
p-h-asymmetric situation, an asymmetric STS lineshape
can arise from both band asymmetries and tunneling in-
terference, and additional information (e.g. from ARPES
or bandstructure calculations) is required to deduce prop-
erties of tunneling paths or hybridizations from STS data.
We have provided concrete examples for simple models of
topological and non-topological Kondo insulators which
we hope to be useful for the interpretation of future tun-
neling experiments.

cf is odd in the position
ρcf (x, y) = −ρcf (−x,−y), has a node on-site, at (0, 0), a max-

with a plus or a minus sign, see Eq. (5), which in turn
increases the strength of the peak either at positive or
negative energies; see Figs. 2(b), 5(b).
In a TKI, in-
stead, the relative sign enhances or depresses all features
related to surface states; see Figs. 6(b), 7(b).
We note that, if the STM apex atom behaves like a c
orbital in the material, we can approximate vf ≈ V < 0,
vc ≈ −tc < 0, leading to sgn(vf vc) = sgn(−tcV ) > 0.
In the STS signal this situation enhances both features
below the gap in a NKI, Figs. 2(b), 5(b), and features
from surface states in a TKI, Figs. 6(b), 7(b).

When ρcf is small, for example in the case of the NKI
with odd hybridization, Fig. 8(b), or for a TKI in 2D,
Figs. 3(b), 4(b) the STS signal is mostly independent
of the sign of vf /vc, and simply proportional to the sum
c ρc + v2
v2
f ρf , i.e. the interference term can be neglected.
We stress that ρcf = 0 does not always imply a symmetric
lineshape, i.e., strongly p-h-asymmetric bands can lead
alone to an asymmetric lineshape, Fig. 4(b). Conversely,
in the 2D case with odd hybridization, p-h asymmetry
is the only source of an asymmetric lineshape (assuming
point tunneling).

VI. EXTENSION TO MORE REALISTIC

MODELS

In this paper we have employed simple four-band mod-
els while real materials, like SmB6, are described by more
complicated models.27,35 We expect, however, that the
main results of this paper remain valid as long as cubic
(or tetragonal) symmetry is preserved.

Concerning SmB6 we remark that existing STS
measurements36,37 ﬁnd quite generally a Fano line-
shape close to the Fermi energy. This appears well
described36,37 by existing simpliﬁed bulk theories14,21
– where the asymmetry mainly arises from bandstruc-
