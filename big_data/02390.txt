We ﬁnd that unjammed packings of frictionless particles with rather weak attraction can always
be driven into solid-like states by shear. The structure of shear-driven solids evolves continuously
with packing fraction from gel-like to jamming-like, but is almost independent of the shear stress.
In contrast, both the density of vibrational states (DOVS) and force network evolve progressively
with the shear stress. There exists a packing fraction independent shear stress σc, at which the
shear-driven solids are isostatic and have a ﬂattened DOVS. Solid-like states induced by a shear
stress greater than σc possess properties of marginally jammed solids and are thus strictly-deﬁned
shear jammed states. Below σc, states at all packing fractions are under isostaticity and share
common features in the DOVS and force network, although their structures can be rather diﬀerent.
Our study reveals the signiﬁcance of the shear stress in determining properties of shear-driven solids
and leads to an enriched jamming phase diagram for weakly attractive particles.

Particulate systems such as colloids, emulsions, foams,
and granular materials can form disordered solids at high
packing fractions [1–11]. The critical packing fraction of
the transition from liquid-like to solid-like states is sen-
sitive to the interaction [11–13] and geometry [14–17] of
particles. Consider the simplest case of static packings
of spheres. If the spheres are frictionless and purely re-
pulsive, the transition happens as the jamming transi-
tion at a critical packing fraction φj [5]. This jamming
transition is signaled by the sudden formation of a rigid
and isostatic force network, i.e., the average coordination
number is equal to twice of the dimension of space. If the
spheres are frictional, jamming can happen at lower pack-
ing fractions [13, 18]. Interestingly, originally unjammed
packings of frictional spheres below φj can jam under
quasistatic shear, which is called shear jamming [11].

Shear jamming can occur at φ < φj because there ex-
ist jammed states of frictional particles, while the shear
just provides an opportunity to search for them in the
sea of unjammed states. Analogically, attraction may
play a similar role as friction in helping produce jammed
islands in the unjammed sea below φj. It is then interest-
ing to know whether shear forces could eﬀectively drive
unjammed states into solid-like states in the presence of
attraction, especially in the zero attraction limit.

Attraction is however qualitatively diﬀerent from fric-
tion, so are the induced phase behaviors. Compared with
packings of frictional spheres which can only jam above
a lower packing fraction limit [11, 13, 18], attraction can
induce more complicated solid-like phases over a wide
range of packing fractions, e.g., gels and glasses at low
and high packing fractions [7–10, 12]. If shear forces help
to form solids in the presence of attraction, we may con-
front various types of solids and have to tackle how to dis-
tinguish them in terms of not only packing fraction but
also shear stress. The output is signiﬁcant to enriching
our knowledge of the shear-driven transition from liquid-

like to solid-like states and completing the jamming phase
diagram for attractive particles [3].

In this letter, we investigate how attraction aﬀects the
picture of the jamming of purely repulsive systems [5]
at zero temperature (T = 0) and ﬁnite shear stresses.
We study the formation and properties of shear-driven
solids of particles interacting via a repulsive core and a
tiny attractive tail. By applying quasistatic shear, we
can always ﬁnd solid-like states below the jamming tran-
sition, where the probability of ﬁnding solid-like states
is almost zero in the absence of shear. By minimizing
a thermodynamic-like potential [19], we eﬃciently sam-
ple solid-like states at ﬁxed packing fraction φ and shear
stress σ, and analyze their structure, force network, and
vibrational properties. The analysis enables us to con-
struct an extended jamming phase diagram in the σ − φ
plane at T = 0. In particular, there is a packing fraction
independent shear stress σc. When σ = σc, shear-driven
solids exhibit features of marginally jammed solids, e.g.,
being isostatic and having a ﬂattened density of vibra-
tional states (DOVS) [5, 20, 21]. Solid-like states driven
by σ > σc are thus strictly-deﬁned shear jammed states.
Our systems are two dimensional with side length L
in both directions. To avoid crystallization, we put N/2
large and N/2 small disks with equal mass m in the sys-
tem. The diameter ratio of the large to small particles is
1.4. Here, we show results for N = 1024 systems. The
interparticle potential is [12, 22]

eter to control the range and strength of attraction. We
vary µ from 10−2 to 10−6, approaching the zero attrac-
tion limit. When µ = 0, the harmonic repulsion widely
employed in the study of jamming [5] is recovered. We
set the units of mass, energy, and length to be particle
mass m, characteristic energy scale of the potential ǫ, and
small particle diameter ds.

The shear deformation is realized by introducing the
shear strain γ and applying the Lees-Edwards bound-
ary conditions [23]. Without shear (γ = 0 or remains
constant), we generate 10000 static states at ﬁxed pack-
ing fraction by applying the fast inertial relaxation en-
gine minimization method [24] to minimize the poten-

tial energy U = Pij U (rij ) of initially random conﬁg-

urations, where the sum is over all pairs of interacting
particles. Figure 1(a) shows the probability P0(φ, µ) of
ﬁnding solid-like states (|U |/N > 10−16) at γ = 0. With
increasing µ, P0(φ, µ) shifts to lower packing fractions.
Employing the deﬁnition in Ref. [5], we determine the
jamming transition threshold φj,µ. As shown in Fig. 1(b),
φj − φj,µ ∼ µ1/3 in the small µ limit, where φj ≈ 0.842.
Figure 1(a) indicates that well below φj,µ the direct-
quench sampling at γ = 0 is almost impossible to ﬁnd
solid-like states. Starting from unjammed states, we suc-
cessively increase γ by a step size ∆γ, followed by a
potential energy minimization. As shown in Fig. 1(c),
in early stage of this quasistatic shear, the system re-
mains unjammed (σ = 0). Interestingly, as long as ∆γ
is small enough, nonzero shear stress emerges and ﬂuc-
tuates when γ > γc, signaling the formation of solid-like

2

states. The solid forming ability under quasistatic shear
decreases with decreasing packing fraction, demonstrated
by the growth of hγci in Fig. 1(d), where h.i denotes the
average over independent runs of quasistatic shear.

The shear stress ﬂuctuates and is not controllable dur-
ing quasistatic shear. To have a clear picture of the
shear stress dependence (which turns out to be impor-
tant), we instead sample shear-driven solids by a re-
cently developed algorithm [19] to well control the shear
stress. By minimizing a thermodynamic-like potential
H = U −σγL2 of arbitrary conﬁgurations, we can quickly
look for solid-like states at desired shear stress σ < σy,
where σy is the yield stress, i.e., the maximum shear
stress for shear-driven solids to exist. As shown in Fig. 1,
it takes some shear strain to ﬁnd shear-driven solids. Fur-
thermore, it is impractical to let γ → ∞. We thus set a
maximum strain γm = 20. The search for shear-driven
solids fails once γ > γm.

For each pair of φ and σ, we run 1000 independent
trials. When σ is small, we can always ﬁnd solid-like
states. The probability of successful trials decreases with
increasing σ near σy. When σ > σy, the search for shear-
driven solids always fails. In Fig. 3(b) of the extended
jamming phase diagram, we show an example of σy(φ)
for µ = 10−3. σy decreases with decreasing φ, and re-
mains nonzero down to rather low packing fractions. At
ﬁxed φ, σy decreases when µ decreases. In particular, we
ﬁnd that σy ∼ µ at low packing fractions. Therefore, in
the small attraction limit, attraction does not act as a
perturbation [25–27], whereas it always induces multiple
types of solid-like states far below the jamming threshold
and qualitatively alters the jamming phase diagram for
purely repulsive particles.

Systems at φ > φj,µ are essentially jammed without
the need of shear, which do not interest us here. The
focus of this work is on the regime of φ < φj,µ, where
direct quenching always ﬁnds unjammed states and solid-
like states can be explored with the help of shear stresses
smaller than σy. In the following, we will mainly discuss
shear-driven solids at φ < φj,µ. Results for φ > φj,µ are
presented just for comparison.

Figures 2(a)-(f) are conﬁgurations with force network
of the shear-driven solids at diﬀerent packing fractions
and shear stresses. At φ ≪ φj,µ, attraction (red bonds)
dominates and the states look gel-like with fractal struc-
tures. Slightly above φj,µ, the structure looks uniform
and particle interactions are predominantly repulsive
(blue bonds). In between, with increasing packing frac-
tion, the structure evolves from gel-like to jamming-like.
Figures 2(g)-(i) demonstrate the packing fraction and
shear stress evolution of the static structure factor S(q) =

D|Pj exp(i~q · ~rj)|2E /N , where q = |~q| is the angular

wavenumber, ~rj is the location of particle j, h.i denotes
the average over solid-like states, and the sum is over all
particles. The structure is almost independent of shear

(µ = 10−3) driven by diﬀerent shear stresses and at diﬀerent packing fractions: φ = 0.60 (top row), 0.75 (middle row), and
0.84 (bottom row). For (a)-(c), σ = 10−6 (well below the yield stress), while for (d)-(f) σ = 6 × 10−6, 2 × 10−5, and 2 × 10−4,
respectively, which are all near the yield stress. The red (blue) lines in (a)-(f) are attractive (repulsive) interactions, with the
thickness illustrating the strength. To have a better vision, we normalize the interaction strength by the maximum value for
every snapshot. The shear stress values of the D(ω) curves are listed in the legend of the S(q) panels to the left.

stress, while it evolves strongly with packing fraction. At
φ ≪ φj,µ, the low q part of S(q) exhibits the typical gel-
like feature, S(q) ∼ q−df with df ≤ 2 being the fractal
dimension [28]. The low q part of S(q) moves down with
increasing packing fraction, and eventually becomes ﬂat
(jamming-like feature [29–31]) near φj,µ.

Purely from the packing fraction evolution of S(q),
we cannot determine the boundary between gel-like and
glass or jamming-like states. Note that the solid-like
states are shear induced. Although the structure is insen-
sitive to the change of shear stress, other quantities may
exhibit shear stress dependence and provide useful infor-
mation to distinguish states. Comparing states at the
same packing fraction but diﬀerent shear stresses [e.g.,
Figs. 2(b) and 2(e)], we can tell that the shear stress
indeed remarkably aﬀects the force network: More par-
ticles interact and repulsion plays a more important role
with increasing shear stress.

Resulting from signiﬁcant changes in the force net-
work, vibrational properties of shear-driven solids ex-
hibit strong shear stress dependence. Figures 2(j)-(l)
show the shear stress evolution of the DOVS, D(ω) =

hPl δ(ω − ωl)i /3N , where ωl is the frequency of the lth

normal mode of vibration, h.i denotes the average over
conﬁgurations, and the sum is over all modes. The nor-
mal modes of vibration are obtained from diagonalizing
the Hessian matrix using ARPACK [32]. When φ > φj,µ,
applying shear stress only weakly aﬀects the force net-

work and elastic properties [19]. As shown in Fig. 2(l),
D(ω) at diﬀerent shear stresses overlap.
Interestingly,
Figs. 2(j) and (k) show that D(ω) has strong shear stress
dependence when φ < φj,µ. For solid-like states induced
by small shear stresses, there is a low-frequency peak in
D(ω), indicating the aggregation of soft modes. With in-
creasing shear stress, the peak moves down and to higher
frequencies, implying the decrease of the amount of soft
modes and that shear-driven solids become stiﬀer and
more stable.

At all packing fractions below φj,µ, the motion of the
low-frequency peak in D(ω) with the change of shear
stress follows the same trend. However, at low packing
fractions where shear-driven solids are typically gel-like,
until at the yield stress, the peak is still present. In con-
trast, near φj,µ, the peak disappears at a crossover shear
stress σc < σy. Meanwhile, D(ω) exhibits a plateau,
which is actually one of the most representative features
of marginally jammed solids of purely repulsive particles
[20, 21, 33]. When σ > σc, the evolution of D(ω) looks
like that of marginally jammed solids under compression,
but here the shear stress is the driving force instead of
the packing fraction.

For marginally jammed solids, the ﬂattening of D(ω)
is associated with isostaticity [20, 21, 33], i.e., the aver-
age coordination number z = zc = 2d with d being the
dimension of space. Is the emergence of the plateau in
D(ω) at σc also related to isostaticity?

10−3) at φ < φj,µ. At each packing fraction, the blue (red)
symbols denote data below (above) the crossover shear stress
σc and with (without) low-frequency peak in the DOVS. The
horizontal and vertical dashed lines label z = 4 and σc ≈
1.2 × 10−5. (b) Extended jamming phase diagram for weakly
attractive particles (µ = 10−3) at T = 0. The circles and
diamonds are the yield stress σy(φ) and crossover shear stress
σc(φ), respectively. The solid and dashed vertical lines are
φ = φj,µ and φ = φrp. F, SJ, SG, I, and J denote regimes
of ﬂowing (white), shear jammed (red), shear gel-like (blue,
φ < φrp), intermediate (blue, φrp < φ < φj,µ), and jammed
(gray, φ > φj,µ) states, respectively.

Figure 3(a) shows the shear stress evolution of the aver-
age coordination number (rattlers excluded) at φ < φj,µ.
When the shear stress is small, there is a plateau in z(σ).
The plateau value approaches zc from below with increas-
ing packing fraction. Approaching the yield stress, the
coordination number grows quickly and collapses onto a
master curve. In each z(σ) curve, data points at σ < σc
and with the low-frequency peak in D(ω) are denoted by
blue symbols, while red symbols represent data at σ > σc.
Surprisingly, z = zc = 4 is exactly the boundary between
two colors, indicating that isostaticity is indeed coupled
to the ﬂattening of D(ω) at σc. Moreover, the collapse of
all data at z > zc implies that the value of σc is indepen-
dent of the packing fraction. We estimate σc at various
packing fractions and ﬁnd that it is indeed constant in φ,
as shown in Fig. 3(b).

Now we see that solid-like states driven by a shear
stress greater than σc possess important features of
marginally jammed solids, such as z > zc and jamming-
like D(ω). It is thus plausible to strictly deﬁne them as
shear jammed solids.

Our major ﬁndings lead to the extended jamming
phase diagram for weakly attractive particles in the σ −φ
plane at T = 0. Figure 3(b) is an example of the diagram
for µ = 10−3.

Strictly-deﬁned shear jamming is encircled by φ = φj,µ,
σy(φ), and σ = σc. Interestingly, σ = σc intersects σy(φ)
roughly at the rigidity percolation threshold, φrp ≈ 0.689
[12]. We have veriﬁed for other values of µ that this is
not a coincidence. As mentioned earlier, solely from S(q),
it is hard to determine the crossover packing fraction to
separate gel-like states from jamming-like states. Now

that shear jammed states only exist at φ > φrp, φ = φrp
is a plausible candidate of such a crossover.

Shear-driven solids lying below σ = σc share some com-
mon features, e.g., existence of the low-frequency peak
in D(ω), z < zc, and attraction dominant, although
they cover a wide range of packing fractions and exhibit
progressive packing fraction evolution of the structure.
States between φrp and φj,µ are particularly interesting.
They have similar structures to shear jammed states but
resemble shear gel-like states at φ < φrp in mechanical
and vibrational properties. We tentatively name them as
intermediate states. The existence of intermediate states
can only be found by the careful study of the shear stress
dependence. It also warns us about the danger to iden-
tify various types of amorphous solids from structure [28]
or vibrational properties [34] alone.

In summary, in the presence of weak attraction, ather-
mal solid-like states are explored by shear over a wide
range of packing fractions below the jamming transition.
Our careful study of the packing fraction and shear stress
dependence reveals that the static structure of shear-
driven solids is sensitive to the change of packing frac-
tion, but not to shear stress.
In contrast, the DOVS
and force network evolve progressively with shear stress.
The strong shear stress dependence enables us to deter-
mine strictly-deﬁned shear jamming and construct an ex-
tended jamming phase diagram in the σ − φ plane.

As shear stress increases, the rigidity of shear-driven
solids at φ < φj,µ increases, reﬂected in the decay of
soft modes and increase of the coordination number and
elastic moduli (not shown). In contrast, increasing shear
stress slightly softens jammed solids well above φj,µ. This
opposite behavior on both sides of φj,µ is analogous to
that of thermal systems: With increasing temperature,
glasses are hardened below the jamming-like transition,
while slightly softened above [35, 36]. Therefore, we pro-
vide evidence supporting that the shear stress can have
similar eﬀects as the temperature on transitions between
liquid-like and solid-like states and properties of amor-
phous solids [37], as proposed by the original jamming
phase diagram [1].

Our work is relevant to experimental systems like gran-
ular materials and non-Brownian colloids. For colloidal
systems with Brownian motion, how temperature aﬀects
shear induced solidiﬁcation is interesting to attack next.
Both the thermal motion and shear can harden systems
at φ < φj,µ. It is quite interesting to ﬁgure out whether
and how they may compete or help each other to induce
unpredictable results in dynamics and phase behaviors.
