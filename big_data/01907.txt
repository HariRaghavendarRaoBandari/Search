Equilateral triangles in subsets of Rd of large Hausdorﬀ dimension

Alex Iosevich and Bochen Liu

Abstract. We prove that subsets of Rd, d ≥ 4 of large enough Hausdorﬀ dimensions contain
vertices of an equilateral triangle. It is known that additional hypotheses are needed to assure the
existence of equilateral triangles in two dimensions (see [3]). We show that no extra conditions
are needed in dimensions four and higher. The three dimensional case remains open.

Some interesting parallels exist between the triangle problem in Euclidean space and its
counter-part in vector spaces over ﬁnite ﬁelds. We shall outline these similarities in hopes of
eventually achieving a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon in the setting of locally
compact abelian groups.

1. Introduction

An old and classical problem that arises in diﬀerent forms in geometric combinatorics, geometric
measure theory, ergodic theory and other areas is to show that a suﬃciently large set contains
vertices of a given geometric conﬁguration. In the realm of positive Lebesgue density, this idea can
be encapsulated in the following theorem due to Tamar Ziegler, building on previous results due to
Bourgain, Furstenberg, Katznelson, Weiss and others (see, for example, [2] and [5]).

(2R)d

Ld{E∩[−R,R]d}

Theorem 1.1. (T. Ziegler ([11]) Let E ⊂ Rd, of positive upper Lebesgue density in the sense
> 0, where Ld denotes the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Let
that lim supR→∞
Eδ denote the δ-neighborhood of E. Let V = {0, v1, v2, . . . , vk−1} ⊂ Rd, where k ≥ 2 is a positive
integer. Then there exists l0 > 0 such that for any l > l0 and any δ > 0 there exists {x1, . . . , xk} ⊂
Eδ congruent to lV = {0, lv1, . . . , lvk−1}.

This result nearly settles the issue of simplexes in sets of positive upper Lebesgue density, though
even there an interesting open question of whether the δ-neighborhood fudge factor in Theorem
1.1 can be eliminated in the case, say, of non-degenerate triangles. If the triangle is allowed to be
degenerate, an example due to Bourgain ([2]) shows that the result is not in general true without
the fudge factor.

A natural question that arises at this point is whether a compact set in Rd of Hausdorﬀ
dimension s0 < d contains a given geometric conﬁguration. This question is already fascinating
in dimension 1. An example due to Keleti shows that there exists a subset of [0, 1] of Hausdorﬀ
dimension 1 which does not contain any arithmetic progressions of length three. However, a result
due to Laba and Pramanik ([9]) shows that there exists s0 < 1 such that a subset of [0, 1] of

Hausdorﬀ dimension s0 contains a progression of length three if it satisﬁes additional structural
assumptions.

A similar diﬃculty arises in higher dimensions. An example due to Falconer ([4]) and (inde-
pendently) Maga ([10]) shows that there exists a set of Hausdorﬀ dimension 2 in R2 which does not
contain vertices of an equilateral triangle. Once again, a result can be established with additional
assumptions on the structure of the set and this was accomplished by Chung, Laba and Pramanik
who proved the following, rather general result.

As the reader can check Theorem 1.3 recovers equilateral triangles in sets of Hausdorﬀ dimension
suﬃciently close to 2 under an additional structural assumption on sizes of balls and the decay rate
of the Fourier transform. A natural question that arises at this point is what happens with triangles
in dimensions 3 and higher. The Chan-Laba-Pramanik result does not address this issue, even under
additional structural assumptions.

Before we state our main result, we would like to point out some interesting parallels between
the conﬁguration problems in Euclidean space and those in vector spaces over ﬁnite ﬁelds. Let Fd
q
denote the ﬁnite with q elements and let Fd
q denote the d-dimensional vector space over Fq. Once
again we may ask whether E ⊂ Fd
q contains vertices of an equilateral triangle if E is suﬃciently
large. In two dimensions there is a fundamental arithmetic obstruction, pointed out in [1], namely
that if Fq does not contain √3, then Fd
q does not contain any equilateral triangles. It is not currently
known whether a ”metric” rather an ”arithmetic” obstruction also exists. On the other hand, when
3 d+1, Hart and the ﬁrst listed author proved in ([7]) that E contains vertices of every

possible congruence class of triangles, including equilateral triangles with every possible side-length
(in Fq). As the reader shall see in a moment, a very similar picture emerges in Euclidean space,
even though the methods and technical formulations are very diﬀerent.

1.1. Statement of results. The main result of this paper is the following. We recover equi-
lateral triangles in sets of suﬃciently large Hausdorﬀ dimension without any additional assumptions
on Fourier decay rate of the underlying measure.

Theorem 1.4. Let E be a compact subset of Rd, d ≥ 4 and µ is a probablity Frostman measure
on E with µ(B(x, r)) ≤ cµrs for all x ∈ Rd, r > 0. Then there exists s0(d, cµ) < d such that if the
s > s0, then E contains vertices of an equilateral triangle.

1.2. Structure of the proof. Our proof consists of three basic steps:

• STEP 1: To construct a natural measure on the set of equilateral triangles of a given

side-length with endpoints in E and prove that it is ﬁnite.

• STEP 2: To modify the Chang-Laba-Pramanik argument to show that with the ﬁrst step

as input, the integral of the measure is strictly positive.

• STEP 3: To show that this measure is not supported on the trivial ”singleton” equilateral
triangles {(x, x, x) : x ∈ E}, thus guaranteeing the existence of a non-trivial equilateral
triangle.

Notation. Throughout this paper, A . B means there exists a constant Cd,cµ such that

A ≤ Cd,cµ B.

Since ∆x0Oy0 is an equilateral triangle implies that ∆y0O(y0−x0) is also an equilateral triangle,

bσ(ξ, η) =bσ(−ξ, ξ + η).
