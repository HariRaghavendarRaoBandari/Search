ABSTRACTIONS OF VARYING DECENTRALIZATION DEGREE FOR

COUPLED MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS

D. BOSKOS AND D. V. DIMAROGONAS

Abstract. In this report, we aim at the development of a decentralized abstraction frame-
work for multi-agent systems under coupled constraints, with the possibility for a varying
degree of decentralization. The methodology is based on the analysis employed in our recent
work, where decentralized abstractions based exclusively on the information of each agent’s
neighbors were derived. In the ﬁrst part of this report, we deﬁne the notion each agent’s m-
neighbor set, which constitutes a measure for the employed degree of decentralization. Then,
suﬃcient conditions are provided on the space and time discretization that provides the ab-
stract system’s model, which guarantee the extraction of a meaningful transition system with
quantiﬁable transition possibilities.

1. Introduction

The analysis and control of multi-agent systems constitutes an active area of research with
numerous applications, ranging from the analysis of power networks to the automatic deploy-
ment of robotic teams [6]. Of central interest in this ﬁeld is the problem of high level task
planning by exploiting tools from formal veriﬁcation [8]. In order to follow this approach for
dynamic (multi-agent) systems it is required to provide an abstract model of the system which
can serve as a tool for the analysis and control of large scale systems and the synthesis of high
level plans. In particular, the use of a suitable discrete representation of the system allows the
automatic synthesis of discrete plans that guarantee satisfaction of the high level speciﬁcations.
Then, under appropriate relations between the continuous system and its discrete analogue,
these plans can be converted to low level primitives such as sequences of feedback controllers,
and hence, enable the continuous system to implement the corresponding tasks.

The need for a formal approach to the aforementioned control synthesis problem has lead to
a considerable research eﬀort for the extraction of discrete state symbolic models, also called
abstractions, which capture properties of interest of continuous state dynamical and control
systems, while ignoring detail. Results in this direction for the nonlinear single plant case have
been obtained in the papers [19] and [26], which are based on partitioning and exploit approx-
imate simulation and bisimulation relations. Symbolic models for piecewise aﬃne systems on
simplices and rectangles were introduced in [13] and have been further studied in [4]. Closer re-
lated to the control framework that we adopt for the abstraction, are the papers [14], [15] which
build on the notion of In-Block Controllability [5]. Other abstraction techniques for nonlinear
systems include [22], where discrete time systems are studied in a behavioral framework and
[1], where box abstractions are studied for polynomial and other classes of systems. It is also
noted that certain of the aforementioned approaches have been extended to switched systems
[10], [11]. Furthermore, abstractions for interconnected systems have been recently developed
in [25], [20], [21], [23], [18], [7] and rely mainly on compositional approaches based on small gain

arguments. Finally, in [17], a compositional approach with a varying selection of subsystems
for the abstraction is exploited, providing a tunable tradeoﬀ between complexity reduction and
model accuracy.

In this framework, we focus on multi-agent systems and assume that the agents’ dynamics
consist of feedback interconnection terms and additional bounded input terms, which we call
free inputs and provide the ability for motion planning under the coupled constraints. In this
report, we generalize the corresponding results of our recent work [2], where suﬃcient conditions
have been derived that guarantee the existence of symbolic models for the agents, which when
composed accordingly, capture behavioral properties of the multi-agent network. In particular,
we extend the approach adopted in [2], where each agent’s abstract model has been based on
the knowledge of the discrete positions of its neighbors, by allowing the agent to have this
information for all members of the network up to a certain distance in the communication
graph. The latter provides an improved estimate of the potential evolution of its neighbors and
allows for more accurate discrete agent models, due to the reduction of the part of the available
control which is required for the manipulation of the coupling terms. In addition, the derived
abstractions are coarser than the ones in [2] and can reduce the computational complexity of
high level task veriﬁcation.

The rest of the report is organized as follows. Basic notation and preliminaries are introduced
in Section 2. In Section 3, we deﬁne well posed abstractions for single integrator multi-agent
systems by means of hybrid feedback controllers and prove that the latter provide solutions
consistent with the design requirement on the systems’ free inputs. Section 4 is devoted to the
study of the control laws that realize the transitions of the proposed discrete system’s model.
In Section 5 we quantify space and time discretizations which guarantee well posed transitions
with motion planning capabilities. The framework is illustrated through an example in Section
6, including simulation results. Finally, we conclude and indicate directions of further research
in Section 7.

2. Preliminaries and Notation

We use the notation |x| for the Euclidean norm of a vector x ∈ Rn and int(S) for the interior
a set S ⊂ Rn. Given R > 0 and x ∈ Rn, we denote by B(R) the closed ball with center 0 ∈ Rn
and radius R, namely B(R) := {x ∈ Rn : |x| ≤ R} and B(x; R) := {y ∈ Rn : |x − y| ≤ R}.

Consider a multi-agent system with N agents. For each agent i ∈ {1, . . . , N} := N we use
the notation Ni ⊂ N \ {i} for the set of its neighbors and Ni for its cardinality. We also
consider an ordering of the agent’s neighbors which is denoted by j1, . . . , jNi. The agents’
network is represented by a directed graph G := (N ,E), with vertex set N the agents’ index
set and edge set E the ordered pairs (ˆi, i) with ˆi, i ∈ V and ˆi ∈ Ni. The sequence i0i1 ··· im
with (i(cid:96)−1, i(cid:96)) ∈ E, (cid:96) = 1, . . . , m, namely, consisting of m consecutive edges in G, forms a path
of length m in G. We will use the notation N m
to denote the set of agents from which i is
(cid:96)=0 N (cid:96)
reachable through a path of length m. We also deﬁne N 0
i
(the set of all agents from which i is reachable by a path of length at most m, including i) and
the sets ˆN m
, namely, the set of all agents from which i is reachable by a path
of length m and not by a shorter one, excluding the possibility to reach itself through a cycle.
With some abuse of language, we will also use the terminology m-neighbor set of agent i for
the set ¯N m
the
cardinality of the sets ¯N m

, since it always contains the agent itself. Finally, we denote by ¯N m

:= {i}, the sets ¯N m

Deﬁnition 2.1. For each agent i ∈ N , we consider a strict total order ≺ on each set ¯N m
that satisﬁes i(cid:48) ≺ i(cid:48)(cid:48) for each i(cid:48) ∈ ˆN m(cid:48)
, with m(cid:48) < m(cid:48)(cid:48) ≤ m (using the notational

We next provide a formal deﬁnition for the notion of a transition system (see for instance

[19]).
Deﬁnition 2.2. A transition system is a tuple T S := (Q, Act,−→), where:

• Q is a set of states.
• Act is a set of actions.
• −→ is a transition relation with −→⊂ Q × Act × Q.

The transition system is said to be ﬁnite, if Q and Act are ﬁnite sets. We also use the (standard)
a−→ q(cid:48) to denote an element (q, a, q(cid:48)) ∈−→. For every q ∈ Q and a ∈ Act we use the
notation q
notation Post(q; a) := {q(cid:48) ∈ Q : (q, a, q(cid:48)) ∈−→}.

3. Abstractions for Multi-Agent Systems

We focus on multi-agent systems with single integrator dynamics

˙xi = ui, xi ∈ Rn, i ∈ N

and consider as inputs decentralized control laws of the form
ui = fi(xi, xj) + vi, i ∈ N ,

3

(3.1)

(3.2)

consisting of two terms, a feedback term fi(·) which depends on the states of i and its neighbors,
) ∈ RNin, and an extra input term vi, which
which we compactly denote by xj := (xj1, . . . , xjNi
we call free input. We also assume that each fi(·), i ∈ N is locally Lipschitz on R(Ni+1)n.

In what follows, we consider a cell decomposition of the state space Rn (which can be regarded
as a partition). In particular, we adopt a modiﬁcation of the corresponding deﬁnition from [12,
p 129-called cell covering].
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let D be a domain of Rn. A cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of D, where
I is a ﬁnite or countable index set, is a family of uniformly bounded and connected sets Sl,
l ∈ I, such that int(Sl) ∩ int(Sˆl) = ∅ for all l (cid:54)= ˆl and ∪l∈ISl = D.

Our aim is to derive ﬁnite or countable abstractions for each individual agent in the coupled
system (3.1)-(3.2), through the selection of a cell decomposition and a time discretization step
δt > 0, based on the knowledge of each agent’s neighbors discrete positions up to a certain
distance in the network graph.
Informally, we would like to consider for each agent i the
transition system with states the possible cells of the state partition, actions all the possible
cells of the agents in its m-neighbor set and transition relation deﬁned as follows. A ﬁnal cell is
reachable from an initial one, if for all states in the initial cell there is a free input such that the
solution of the system will reach the ﬁnal cell at time δt for all possible initial states of the agents
in its m-neighbor set in their cells and their corresponding free inputs. Throughout the report,
we consider a ﬁxed m ∈ N which speciﬁes the m-neighbor set of each agent and will refer to it as
the degree of decentralization. Also, given a cell decomposition S := {Sl}l∈I of Rn, we use
the notation li = (li, lj1
to denote the indices
of the cells where agent i and its m-neighbors belong at a certain time instant and call it the
m-cell conﬁguration of agent i. We will also use the shorter notation li = (li, lj1
),
or just li. Similarly, we use the notation l = (l1, . . . , lN ) ∈ I N to specify the indices of the cells
where all the N agents belong at a given time instant and call it the cell conﬁguration (of all
agents). Thus, given a cell conﬁguration l, it is possible to determine the cell conﬁguration of
agent i as li = pri(l) (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition of pri(·)).

In order to provide meaningful decentralized abstractions we follow parts of the approach
employed in [2] and design appropriate hybrid feedback laws in place of the vi’s in order to
guarantee well posed transitions. Before proceeding to the necessary deﬁnitions related to the
problem formulation, we provide some bounds on the dynamics of the multi-agent system.

We assume that the feedback terms fi(·) are globally bounded, namely, that there exists a

constant M > 0 such that

|fi(xi, xj)| ≤ M,∀(xi, xj) ∈ R(Ni+1)n, i ∈ N

(3.3)

and that they are globally Lipschitz functions. Furthermore, in order to obtain more accurate
bounds for the dynamics of the feedback controllers that will be assigned to the free inputs vi in
the next sections, we can choose for each agent (possibly) diﬀerent Lipschitz constants L1 > 0
and L2 > 0, such that

|fi(xi, xj) − fi(xi, yj)| ≤ L1|(xi, xj) − (xi, yj)|,

∀xi ∈ Rn, xj, yj ∈ RNin, i ∈ N ,

|fi(xi, xj) − fi(yi, xj)| ≤ L2|(xi, xj) − (yi, xj)|,

∀xi, yi ∈ Rn, xj ∈ RNin, i ∈ N .

(3.4)

(3.5)

Finally, we assume that each input vi, i ∈ N is piecewise continuous and satisﬁes the bound
(3.6)

|vi(t)| ≤ vmax(< M ),∀t ≥ 0.

Furthermore, based on the uniform bound on the diameters of the cells in the decomposition
of the workspace, we can deﬁne the diameter dmax of the cell decomposition as

2 )}.

dmax := inf{R > 0 : ∀l ∈ I,∃x ∈ Sl with Sl ⊂ B(x; R

(3.7)
Given a cell decomposition we will consider a ﬁxed selection of a reference point zl,G ∈ Sl for
each cell Sl, l ∈ I. For each agent i and m-cell conﬁguration of i, the corresponding reference
points of the cells in the conﬁguration will provide a reference trajectory that the agent will
track over the interval indicated by the time discretization step. Furthermore, they provide an
estimate of the corresponding reference trajectories of its neighbors, for m-cell conﬁgurations of
its neighbors that are consistent with the cell conﬁguration of i, namely for which the “common
agents” belong to the same cells, as deﬁned below.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Consider an agent i ∈ N , a neighbor ˆi ∈ Ni of i and m-cell conﬁgurations

fulﬁlled for certain m(cid:48) ∈ {1, . . . , m − 1} and consider any k ∈ ¯N m−(m(cid:48)+1)
. Notice ﬁrst, that
since m−(m(cid:48) +1) ≤ m−2, both ˜x[i]
respective components satisfy (3.19) with m(cid:48). Then, by evaluating the diﬀerence |˜x[i]
as in (8.4) in the Appendix and exploiting (3.19) for the diﬀerences |˜x[i]
(·) − ˜x[ˆi]

In order to provide the deﬁnition of well posed transitions for the individual agents, we will

exploit for each agent i ∈ N the following system with disturbances:

˙xi = fi(xi, dj) + vi,

(3.21)
: [0,∞) → Rn are continuous functions. Also, before deﬁning the notion
where dj1, . . . , djNi
of a well posed space time discretization we provide a class of hybrid feedback laws which are
assigned to the free inputs vi in order to obtain meaningful discrete transitions. For each agent,
these control laws are parameterized by the agent’s initial conditions and a set of auxiliary
parameters belonging to a nonempty subset W of Rn. These parameters, as will be clariﬁed in
the next section, are exploited for motion planning. In particular, for every agent i, the choice
of each vector wi ∈ W is in a one-to-one correspondence with the choice of a point inside a
reachable ball for i and thus, provides the possibility for the agent to perform transitions to
multiple cells. I addition, for each agent i, the feedback laws in the following deﬁnition depend
on the selection of the cells where i and its m-neighbors belong.

Deﬁnition 3.9. Given a cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of Rn, a time step δt and a nonempty

xi0 ∈ Sli and wi ∈ W , consider the mapping ki,li(·,·,·; xi0, wi) : [0,∞) × R(Ni+1)n → Rn,
parameterized by xi0 ∈ Sli and wi ∈ W . We say that ki,li(·) satisﬁes Property (P), if the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(P1) The mapping ki,li (t, xi, xj; xi0, wi) is continuous on [0,∞) × R(Ni+1)n × Sli × W .
(P2) The mapping ki,li(t,·,·; xi0, wi) is globally Lipschitz continuous on (xi, xj) (uniformly
with respect to t ∈ [0,∞), xi0 ∈ Sli and wi ∈ W ). (cid:47)
The next deﬁnition characterizes the bounds on the deviation between the reference trajectory
of each agent’s neighbor and its estimate obtained from the solution of the initial value problem
for the speciﬁc agent.
Deﬁnition 3.10. Consider an agent i ∈ N . We say that a continuous function αi : [0, δt] →
R≥0 satisﬁes the neighbor reference trajectory deviation bound, if for each cell conﬁgu-
ration li of i, neighbor jκ, κ = 1, . . . , Ni of i and cell conﬁguration of each jκ consistent with li
it holds:

We are now in position to formalize our requirement which describes the possibility for an
agent to perform a discrete transition, based on the knowledge of its m-cell conﬁguration. The
corresponding deﬁnition below includes certain bounds on the evolution of the agent, which we
sharpen, by requiring the reference points zl,G, l ∈ I of the cell decomposition to satisfy

|zl,G − x| ≤ dmax
2

,∀x ∈ Sl, l ∈ I.

(3.23)

Due to (3.7), the latter is always possible. The deﬁnition exploits the auxiliary system with
disturbances (3.21), which is inspired by the approach adopted in [9], where a nonlinear system
is modelled by means of a piecewise aﬃne system with disturbances.
Deﬁnition 3.11. Consider a cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of Rn, a time step δt, a nonempty
subset W of Rn, and a continuous function β : [0, δt] → R≥0 satisfying

dmax

≤ β(0); β(δt) ≤ vmaxδt.

(3.24)
Also, consider an agent i ∈ N , a continuous function αi : [0, δt] → R≥0 satisfying the neighbor
reference trajectory deviation bound (3.22), an m-cell conﬁguration li of i and the solution of
the initial value problem of Deﬁnition 3.3. Then, given a control law

vi = ki,li(t, xi, xj; xi0, wi)

(3.25)
as in Deﬁnition 3.9, that satisﬁes Property (P), a vector wi ∈ W , and a cell index l(cid:48) ∈ I, we say
that the Consistency Condition is satisﬁed if the following hold. The set int(B(˜xi(δt); β(δt)))∩
Sl(cid:48)
, such that for each ini-
tial condition xi0 ∈ int(Sli) and selection of continuous functions dj1 , . . . , djNi
: R≥0 → Rn, the
solution xi(·) of the system with disturbances (3.21) with vi = ki,li(t, xi, dj; xi0, wi), satisﬁes
the following implication for each ¯t ∈ [0, δt]

(3.26)

Notice, that when the Consistency Condition is satisﬁed, agent i can be driven to cell Sl(cid:48)
precisely in time δt under the feedback law ki,li(·) corresponding to the given parameter wi in
the deﬁnition. The latter is possible for all disturbances which satisfy the left hand side of the
implication in (3.26) and capture the possibilities for the evolution of i’s neighbors over the
time interval [0, δt], given the knowledge of the m-cell conﬁguration of i. We next provide the
deﬁnition of a well posed space-time discretization. This deﬁnition formalizes the acceptable
space and time discretizations through the possibility to assign a feedback law to each agent,
in order to enable a meaningful transition from an initial to a ﬁnal cell in accordance to the
Consistency Condition above.
Deﬁnition 3.12. Consider a cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of Rn, a time step δt and a
nonempty subset W of Rn.
(a) Given a continuous function β : [0, δt] → R≥0 that satisﬁes (3.24), an agent i ∈ N , a
continuous function αi : [0, δt] → R≥0 satisfying (3.22) an initial m-cell conﬁguration li of i
and a cell index l(cid:48)
i is well posed with respect to
the space-time discretization S − δt, if there exist a feedback law vi = ki,li(·,·,·; xi0, wi) as
in Deﬁnition 3.9 that satisﬁes Property (P), and a vector wi ∈ W , such that the Consistency
Condition of Deﬁnition 3.11 is fulﬁlled.
(b) We say that the space-time discretization S − δt is well posed, if there exists a
continuous function β : [0, δt] → R≥0 that satisﬁes (3.24), such that for each agent i ∈ N there
exists a continuous function αi : [0, δt] → R≥0 satisfying (3.22), in a way that for each cell
conﬁguration li of i, there exists a cell index l(cid:48)
i is well
posed with respect to S − δt.

i ∈ I we say that the transition li

i ∈ I such that the transition li

li−→ l(cid:48)

li−→ l(cid:48)

We remark, that requirements of the type of Deﬁnition 3.12(a) can be found in the notion

of In-Block Controllability, which has been introduced in [5] and further studied in [14].

Given a space-time discretization S − δt and based on Deﬁnition 3.12(a), it is now possible to
provide an exact deﬁnition of the discrete transition system which serves as an abstract model
for the behaviour of each agent.
Deﬁnition 3.13. For each agent i, its individual transition system T Si := (Qi, Acti,−→i) is
deﬁned as follows:
• Qi := I (the indices of the cell decomposition)
• Acti := I ¯N m
• ˆli
lj2
Remark 3.14. Given a well posed space-time discretization S − δt and an initial cell conﬁgu-
ration l = (l1, . . . , lN ) ∈ I N , it follows from Deﬁnitions 3.12 and 3.13 that for each agent i ∈ N
it holds Posti(li; pri(l)) (cid:54)= ∅ (Posti(·) refers to the transition system T Si of each agent-see also
Section 2).

According to Deﬁnition 3.12, a well posed space-time discretization requires the existence of
a well posed transition for each agent i and m-cell conﬁguration of i, and the latter reduces
to the selection of an appropriate feedback controller for i, which also satisﬁes Property (P)
and guarantees that the auxiliary system with disturbances (3.21) satisﬁes the Consistency
Condition. We next show, that given an initial cell conﬁguration and a well posed transition
for each agent, it is possible to choose a feedback law for each agent, so that the resulting closed-
loop system will guarantee all these well posed transitions (for all possible initial conditions in
the cell conﬁguration). At the same time, it will follow that the magnitude of the hybrid
feedback laws does not exceed the maximum allowed magnitude vmax of the free inputs on
[0, δt], and hence, establishes consistency with the initial design requirement (3.6).
Proposition 3.15. Consider system (3.1)-(3.2), let l = (l1, . . . , lN ) ∈ I N be an initial cell
conﬁguration and assume that the space-time discretization S−δt is well posed, which according
to Remark 3.14 implies that for all i ∈ N it holds that Posti(li; pri(l)) (cid:54)= ∅. Then, for every
N ) ∈ Post1(l1; pr1(l)) × ··· × PostN (lN ; prN (l)), there exist
(cid:48)

feedback laws

= (l(cid:48)

vi = ki,pri(l)(t, xi, xj; xi0, wi), i ∈ N ,

(3.29)
satisfying Property (P), w1, . . . , wN ∈ W and a vector x(cid:48) = (x(cid:48)
N ) ∈ Sl1 ×···× SlN , such
that for each i ∈ N , the solution of the closed-loop system (3.1)-(3.2), (3.29) (with vκ = kκ,prκ(l),
κ ∈ N ) is well deﬁned on [0, δt], and its i-th component satisﬁes

i ∈ Sl(cid:48)

i

,∀x(0) ∈ RnN : xκ(0) = xκ0 ∈ Slκ , κ ∈ N .

(3.30)

Furthermore, it follows that each control law ki,li evaluated along the corresponding solution of
the system satisﬁes

|ki,pri(l)(t, xi(t), xj(t); xi0, wi)| ≤ vmax,∀t ∈ [0, δt], i ∈ N ,

(3.31)

which provides the desired consistency with the design requirement (3.6) on the vi’s.

(cid:48)

1, . . . , l(cid:48)

pri(l)−→ l(cid:48)

Proof. Indeed, consider a ﬁnal cell conﬁguration l
N ) as in the statement of the
proposition. By the deﬁnitions of the operators Posti(·), i ∈ N and the transition relation of
each corresponding agent’s individual transition system, it follows that there exist continuous
functions β : [0, δt] → R≥0 satisfying (3.24) and αi : [0, δt] → R≥0, i ∈ N satisfying (3.22),
such that each transition li
i is well posed in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.12(a). Hence, we
can pick for each agent i ∈ N a control law ki,pri(l)(·) that satisﬁes Property (P) and a vectors
wi ∈ W , x(cid:48)
i, we pick for each agent i an initial condition
xi0 ∈ int(Sli). Notice, that by virtue of Property (P2) of the control laws, the solution of the
closed loop system is deﬁned for all t ≥ 0. Furthermore, by recalling that for each i ∈ N it
holds xi,G = zli,G and xi0 ∈ int(Sli), we obtain from (3.23) that |xi0 − xi,G| < dmax
for all
i ∈ N . Hence, by continuity of the solution of the closed-loop system (3.1)-(3.2), (3.29) we
deduce from (3.24) that there exists δ ∈ (0, δt], such that for all i ∈ N it holds

After the selection of ki,pri(l)(·), wi and x(cid:48)

, such that the requirements of the Consistency Condition are fulﬁlled.

where xi(·) is the i-th component of the solution and ˜x[i]

(3.32)
i (·) is the reference trajectory of i
i (0) = xi,G. We

11

claim that for each i ∈ N , (3.32) holds with δ = δt. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that there
exist an agent ˆi ∈ N and a time T ∈ (0, δt], such that

|xˆi(T ) − ˜x[ˆi]

ˆi

(T )| ≥ β(T )

Next, we deﬁne

τ := sup{¯t ∈ (0, δt] : |xi(t) − ˜x[i]

i (t)| < β(t),∀t ∈ [0, ¯t], i ∈ N}

Then, it follows from (3.32), (3.33) and (3.34), that τ is well deﬁned and satisﬁes

0 < τ ≤ δt,

and that there exists (cid:96) ∈ N such that

|x(cid:96)(τ ) − ˜x[(cid:96)]
Next, notice that by the deﬁnition of τ , it holds

(cid:96) (τ )| = β(τ )

|xj((cid:96))κ(t) − ˜x[j((cid:96))κ]

j((cid:96))κ

(t)| ≤ β(t),∀t ∈ [0, τ ], κ = 1, . . . , N(cid:96)

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

Also, since the m-cell conﬁguration prj((cid:96))(l) of j((cid:96)) is consistent with the conﬁguration pr(cid:96)(l)
of (cid:96), it follows from (3.22) and the fact that τ < δt, that

|˜x[(cid:96)]

j((cid:96))κ

(t) − ˜x[j((cid:96))κ]

j((cid:96))κ

(t)| ≤ ακ(t),∀t ∈ [0, τ ], κ = 1, . . . , N(cid:96)

Hence, we obtain that

|xj((cid:96))κ (t) − ˜x[(cid:96)]

j((cid:96))κ

(t)| ≤ β(t) + ακ(t),∀t ∈ [0, τ ], κ = 1, . . . , N(cid:96)

(3.37)

(3.38)

By setting dj((cid:96))κ (t) := xj((cid:96))κ (t), κ = 1, . . . , N(cid:96), it follows from standard uniqueness results from
ODE theory, that x(cid:96)(·) is also the solution of the system with disturbances (3.21), with i = (cid:96),
vi = ki,li(t, xi, dj; xi0, wi), and initial condition x(cid:96)0 ∈ int(Sl(cid:96)). Thus, we obtain from (3.26)
that |x(cid:96)(τ ) − ˜x[(cid:96)]
(cid:96) (τ )| < β(τ ), which contradicts (3.35). Hence, we conclude that (3.32) holds
for δ = δt.

Next, by using the same arguments as above, we can deduce that for each agent i, the i-th
component of the solution of the closed loop system, is the same as the solution of system (3.21)
for i, with disturbances djκ(·), κ = 1, . . . , Ni, being the components xjκ (·), κ = 1, . . . , Ni, of the
solution corresponding to i’s neighbors. Furthermore, it follows that the disturbances satisfy
the left hand side of the implication in (3.26). Hence, from the Consistency Condition, and
the fact that the components of the solution of the closed loop system and the corresponding
solutions of the systems with disturbances are identical, we obtain that (3.30) and (3.31) are
satisﬁed.

For the general case where xi0 ∈ Slˆi

for all i ∈ ˆN , we can exploit for each i continuity of
the i-th component of the solution xi(·) with respect to initial conditions and parameters, in
order to prove validity of the proposition. In particular, xi(t, x0; x0, w) depends by virtue of
Property (P1) continuously on x0 (both as the initial condition and as a parameter) and on the
parameters w = (w1, . . . , wN ) ∈ W N . Thus, for the ﬁxed w, there exists a sequence {x0,ν}ν∈N
with x0,ν → x0 and x0κ,ν ∈ int(Slκ), ∀κ ∈ N , ν ∈ N, such that

xi(t, x0,ν; x0,ν, w) → xi(t, x0; x0, w),∀t ∈ [0, δt]

(3.39)

Hence, by taking into account that due to (3.30) and (3.31) it holds
,∀i ∈ N ,

xi(δt, x0,ν; x0,ν, w) = x(cid:48)

i ∈ Sl(cid:48)

i

12

and

|ki,pri(l)(t, xi(t, x0,ν; x0,ν, w), xj(t, x0,ν; x0,ν, w); xi0, wi)| ≤ vmax,∀t ∈ [0, δt], i ∈ N ,

it follows by virtue of (3.39), that (3.30) and (3.31) also hold for the general case. The proof is
(cid:3)
now complete.

4. Design of the Hybrid Control Laws

Consider again system (3.1)-(3.2). We want to determine suﬃcient conditions which guar-
antee that the space-time discretization S − δt is well posed. According to Deﬁnition 3.12,
establishment of a well posed discretization is based on the design of appropriate feedback laws
which guarantee well posed transitions for all agents and their possible cell conﬁgurations. We
postpone the derivation of acceptable dmax and δt that fulﬁll well posedness for the next section
and proceed by deﬁning the control laws that are exploited in order to derive well posed dis-
cretizations. Consider a cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of Rn, a time step δt and a selection of
a reference point zl,G for each cell, satisfying (3.23). For each agent i and m-cell conﬁguration
li of i, we deﬁne the family of feedback laws ki,li : [0,∞) × R(Ni+1)n → Rn parameterized by
xi0 ∈ Sli and wi ∈ W as

ki,li(t, xi, xj; xi0, wi) := ki,li,1(t, xi, xj) + ki,li,2(xi0) + ki,li,3(t; wi),

where

and

W := B(vmax) ⊂ Rn,

. In
particular, ˜xi(·) constitutes a reference trajectory, whose endpoint agent i should reach at time

ζ(t)wi, with wi ∈ W in (4.2) provides a possible “velocity” of a motion that we superpose to
the reference trajectory ˜xi(·) of agent i, allowing thus the agent to reach all points inside a
ball with center the position of the reference trajectory at time δt. In particular, each vector
ζ(t)wi, with wi ∈ W in (4.2) provides a possible “velocity” of a motion that we superpose to
the reference trajectory ˜xi(·) of agent i, allowing thus the agent to reach all points inside a
ball with center the position of the reference trajectory at time δt. In particular, consider a
cell decomposition, a time step δt and a cell conﬁguration of i as depicted in Figure 1 below.
The reference trajectory of i, starting from xi,G, is obtained from the initial value problem
of Deﬁnition 3.3, by considering the unforced solution of the subsystem formed by agent’s i
m-neighbor set. Thus, the feedback term ki,li,1(·), enforces the agent to move in parallel to its
reference trajectory. Also, by selecting a vector wi in W and a function ζ(·) as in (4.6), we can

13

exploit the extra terms ki,li,2(·) and ki,li,3(·) to navigate the agent to the point x inside the
ball B(˜xi(δt); r) (the dashed circle in Figure 1) at time δt from any initial state xi0 ∈ Sli. In a
similar way, it is possible to reach any point inside this ball by a diﬀerent selection of wi. This
ball has radius

namely, the distance that the agent can cross in time δt by exploiting ki,li,3(·), which corresponds
to the part of the free input that is available for planning. Hence, it is possible to perform a
well posed transition to any cell which has nonempty intersection with B(˜xi(δt); r) (the cyan
cells in Figure 1). Notice, that due to the assumption vmax < M in (3.6), it is in principle not
possible to cancel the interconnection terms. An example of a cooperative controller motivating
this assumption can be found in our recent paper [3], where appropriate coupling terms ensure
robust connectivity of the multi-agent network for bounded free inputs.

Furthermore, we select a constant ¯c ∈ (0, 1), which for each agent, is a measure of the devi-

consistent cell conﬁgurations). By deﬁning

(4.11)

The proof of both (4.10) and (4.11) is based on elementary calculations and is provided in the
Appendix. Hence, it follows from (4.11) and the result of Proposition 3.8, namely, (3.17), that
if we select the functions αi(·) in Deﬁnition 3.10 as αi(·) ≡ α(·), ∀i ∈ N , with

α(t) := cM t,∀t ∈ [0, δt];

c := ¯cm−1,

then the neighbor reference trajectory deviation bound (3.22) is satisﬁed for all 0 < δt ≤ ¯t.

5. Well Posed Space-Time Discretizations with Motion Planning Capabilities

In this section, we exploit the controllers introduced in Section 4 to provide suﬃcient condi-
tions for well posed space-time discretizations. By exploiting the result of Proposition 3.15 this
framework can be applied for motion planning, by specifying diﬀerent possibilities for transi-
tions for each agent through modifying its controller. As in the previous section, we consider
the system (3.1)-(3.2), a cell decomposition S = {Sl}l∈I of Rn, a time step δt and a selection
of reference points zl,G, l ∈ I as in (3.23). For each agent i ∈ N and m-cell conﬁguration
li ∈ I ¯N m
i of i, consider the family of feedback laws given in (4.3), (4.4), (4.5), and parameter-
ized by xi0 ∈ Sli and wi ∈ W . As in the previous sections, ˜xi(·) is the reference solution of the
initial value problem corresponding to the m-cell conﬁguration of i. Recall that the parameters
λ and ¯λ in (4.6) provide the lower and upper portion of the free input that is exploited for
¯
planning. Thus, they can be regarded as a measure for the degree of control freedom that is
chosen for the abstraction. We proceed by providing the desired suﬃcient conditions for a space
time discretization to be suitable for motion planning.
Theorem 5.1. Consider a cell decomposition S of Rn with diameter dmax, a time step δt, the
λ, ¯λ in (4.6). We assume that dmax and δt

with L1, L2, M , vmax, c and ¯t as given in (3.4), (3.5), (3.3), (3.6), (4.12) and (4.9), respectively.
Then, for each agent i ∈ N and cell conﬁguration li of i we have Posti(li; li) (cid:54)= ∅, namely, the
space-time discretization is well posed for the multi-agent system (3.1)-(3.2). In particular, it
holds

Posti(li; li) ⊃ {l ∈ I : Sl ∩ B(˜xi(δt); r) (cid:54)= ∅},

(5.3)

where r is deﬁned in (4.7) with

ζ(t) :=

λ, t ∈ [0, δt]
¯
Proof. For the proof, let i ∈ N and li ∈ I ¯N m
i .
In order to prove that the discretization is
well posed, we will specify, according to Deﬁnition 3.12(b), continuous functions β(·) and αi(·),
i ∈ N , satisfying (3.24) and (3.22), respectively, in such a way that (5.3) holds. We pick β as in
(4.8) and αi ≡ α, for all i ∈ N , with α as given in (4.12). For the derivation of (5.3), namely,
∩ B(˜xi(δt); r) (cid:54)= ∅ is well posed, it suﬃces to show that
that each transition li
for each x ∈ B(˜xi(δt); r) and l(cid:48)
i is well posed.
Thus, for each x ∈ B(˜xi(δt); r) and l(cid:48)
, we need according to Deﬁnition
3.12(a) to ﬁnd a feedback law (3.25) satisfying Property (P) and a vector wi ∈ W , in such a
way that the Consistency Condition is fulﬁlled.

with

¯
i ∈ I such that x ∈ Sl(cid:48)
(4.5) and with wi as deﬁned in (5.5), and we will show that for all l(cid:48)
the Consistency Condition is satisﬁed. Notice ﬁrst that ki,li (·) satisﬁes Property (P). In order
to show the Consistency Condition we pick xi0 ∈ int(Sli ), x(cid:48)
i := x with x as selected above
and prove that the solution xi(·) of (3.21) with vi = ki,li satisﬁes (3.26), (3.27) and (3.28). We
break the subsequent proof in the following steps.

STEP 2: Estimation of bounds on ki,li,1(·), ki,li,2(·) and ki,li,3(·) along the solution

For the second diﬀerence on the right hand side of (5.8), we obtain from (3.4), (3.15), (3.26),

1, that

Hence, it follows from the evaluated bounds on the diﬀerences of the right hand side of (5.8)

(3.23) that

6. Example and Simulation Results

As an illustrative example we consider a system of four agents with states x1, x2, x3, x4 ∈ R2,

whose initial conditions lie inside a bounded domain of R2. Their dynamics are given as

˙x1 = sat¯r(x2 − x1) + v1,
˙x2 = v2
˙x3 = sat¯r(x2 − x3) + v3
˙x4 = sat¯r(x3 − x4) + v4
where the saturation function sat¯r : R2 → R2 is deﬁned as
if x < ¯r
if x ≥ ¯r

(cid:26) x,

sat¯r(x) :=

¯r|x| x,

, x ∈ R2.

The agents’ neighbors’ sets in this example are N1 = {2}, N2 = ∅, N3 = {2}, N4 = {3} and
specify the corresponding network topology. The constant ¯r > 0 above satisﬁes ¯r ≤ R and
represents a bound on the distance between agents 1, 2, and agents 2, 3, that we will require
the system to satisfy during its evolution. It is not hard to show that this is possible if we select
vmax := ¯r
2 . Hence we obtain the dynamics bounds and Lipschitz constants M := ¯r, L1 := 1
and L2 := 1 for all agents. By selecting the degree of decentralization m = 2, it follows that
the conditions of Theorem 5.2 are satisﬁed. By choosing the constant ¯λ = 1 in (4.6) we obtain
from (5.12) and (5.13) (notice also that Nmax = 1) that

For the simulation results we pick

the workspace [−10, 10] × [−10, 10] ⊂ R2 into squares and select the initial conditions of the
agents 1, 2, 3 and 4 at (9, 4), (4, 4), (−6, 6) and (−9,−4), respectively, which respect the desired
initial bound on the distance between agents 1, 2, and agents 2, 3. We assume that agent 2,
which is unaﬀected by the coupled constraints has constant velocity v2 = (−1,−4) and study
reachability properties of the system over the time interval [0, 2]. The sampled trajectory of
agent 2 is visualized with the circles in the ﬁgure below, and the blue/magenta cells indicate the
union of agents 3/1 reachable cells over the time interval (given the trajectory of 2). Finally,
given the trajectory of 2 and selecting the discrete trajectory of 3 which is depicted with the
red cells in the ﬁgure, we obtain with yellow the corresponding reachable cells of agent 4. The
simulation results have been implemented in MATLAB with a running time of the order of a
few seconds, on a PC with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz processor.

7. Conclusions

We have provided an abstraction framework for multi-agent systems which is based on a
varying degree of decentralization for the information of each agent with respect to the graph
topology of the network. Well posed transitions have been modeled by exploiting a system
with disturbances in order to model the possible evolution of the agents neighbors. Suﬃcient
conditions on the space and time discretization have been quantiﬁed in order to capture the
reachability properties of the symbolic models through well deﬁned transitions. The latter
are realized by means of hybrid feedback control laws which take into account the coupled
constraints and navigate the agents to their successor cells.

Ongoing work includes the improvement of the agents’ reachabilty properties, based on
their local dynamics bounds and Lipschitz constants which will enable the exploitation of a
larger part of the free inputs for the transitions to successor cells. In addition we aim at the
formulation of an online abstraction framework for heterogeneous agents with updated choices
of the discretization and planning parameters.

satisﬁes ˙g(0) =

which by virtue of (4.9) implies (4.10). We next show (4.11) by induction on κ ∈ {1, . . . , m}.
Notice that by (3.18), (4.11) holds for κ = 1. Assuming that it is valid for certain κ ∈ {1, . . . , m}
we show that also holds for κ = κ + 1. Hence, by exploiting (3.18), (4.9) and (4.11) with m = κ
