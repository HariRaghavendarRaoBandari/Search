Empirical Parameterization of Nucleon-Nucleon Scattering
Amplitude at High Energies for Glauber Calculations and

Monte Carlo Simulations

V. Uzhinsky1, A. Galoyan2, Q. Hu3,4, J. Ritman4,5, H. Xu4

Parameterization of the nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering amplitude is needed for future
experiments with nucleon and nuclear beams in the kinetic energy range 1 – 50 GeV/nucleon.
The amplitude is used in Glauber calculations of various cross sections and Monte Carlo
simulations of nucleon-nucleon scatterings. Usually, the diﬀerential nucleon-nucleon elastic
scattering cross sections are described by an exponential expression. Fitting corresponding
experimental data on pp interactions at |t| > 0.005 (GeV/c)2 and |t| ≤ 0.125 (GeV/c)2 we
have found parameters of the expression and propose formulae for approximations of their
energy dependencies in the considered energy range. The same was done for np interactions
at |t| ≤ 0.5 (GeV/c)2. Expressions for the energy dependence of the total and elastic cross
sections, and the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the amplitude at zero momentum transfer
are also given for pp and np collisions. It is suﬃcient for the Glauber calculations in a ﬁrst
approximation. For more exact calculations we ﬁt the data at |t| > 0.005 (GeV/c)2 without
restrictions on maximum value of |t| using a two coherent exponential expression. The
parameters of the ﬁts are found for the energy range 1.5 – 50 GeV.

Introduction

Parameterizations of nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering amplitude are widely used in many Glauber cal-
culations, for example, for studies of the structure of exotic nuclei and the neutron skin of nuclei [1] – [17],
calculations of diﬀerential cross sections and reaction cross sections of hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
interactions [18, 19], experimental research of high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions with various impact
parameter [20, 21], etc. When the nucleon-nucleon interaction radius (∼ 1 fm) is smaller than the nuclear
size, it is suﬃcient to ﬁrst approximation to know the amplitude at zero scattering angle. This amplitude
is connected with the total cross section and the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the amplitude at small
momentum transfer. In the case of inelastic reactions, a so-called ”inelastic nucleon-nucleon interaction
proﬁle” is used. The proﬁle is also connected with the amplitude. Thus, good knowledge of the amplitude
is very important for various applications.

A standard parameterization of the spin averaged nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering amplitude is:

dσ/dt = π|F (t)|2 = |A|2eBt,

σtot = 4πIm(F (0)),

A =

σtot
4√π

(i + ρ),

ρ = Re(F (0))/Im(F (0)).

A set of its parameters at various energies [22] is widely applied in calculations at low and intermediate
energies (see also [23]). In principle, the parameters can be obtained by ﬁtting the partial wave analysis
results [24] – [30], [31] at energies below 5 GeV as it was done in [22]. Predictions of the partial wave
analysis in a tabulated form are used in the PLUTO event generator [32] and in the Geant4 toolkit [33].
At energies higher than ∼ 20 GeV, there are many parameterizations of the energy dependence of
the total nucleon-nucleon cross section and ρ including ones by the Particle Data Group (PDG) [34].
Recently, formulae for values of the slope parameter, B, were presented in [35].

A large set of data on proton-proton diﬀerential cross sections, analyzing powers and the double
polarization parameter, AN N , at proton beam momenta from 3 GeV/c to 50 GeV/c were analyzed in

[36] employing the Regge formalism. ρ, ω, f2, and a2 trajectories and single-Pomeron exchange were
considered. A complicated form of the reggeon amplitudes prevents its simple application in Glauber
calculations.

In Sec. 1, we present ﬁts of diﬀerential proton-proton elastic scattering cross sections by Eq. 1 in the
energy range 1 – 50 GeV. Approximate formulae for energy dependence of the parameters are given. We
also check the self-consistency of the ﬁtted A, σtot and ρ parameters. Here, we use the latest data of
COSY [37] to estimate ρ in the kinetic energy range 1 – 2.8 GeV.

The simple exponential parameterization cannot describe the experimental data at large |t| values,
especially at |t| ≥1–1.5 (GeV/c)2, where the slope of the diﬀerential cross sections becomes smaller. Thus,
integration of Eq. 1 will lead to an underestimation of elastic cross section, σel, and to an overestimation
of the inelastic one. Thus, a new expression for the diﬀerential cross section is needed.

A very simple and transparent parameterization of the elastic scattering amplitude was proposed in
Ref. [38] with an analysis of anti-proton-proton data at Plab = 1.11, 1.33, and 1.52 GeV/c. A wider set of
the ¯pp data was considered in papers [39, 40, 41, 42]. An analogous parameterization was independently
proposed in paper [43]. The authors of the paper [43] analyzed only pp experimental data at Plab =12,
14.2, 19.2, 24, 29.7 GeV/c and at √spp = 53 GeV. χ2/N DF and parameter errors were not given. Various
extensions of the parameterization were proposed at higher energies [44, 45, 46, 47]. Its application to
low energy data is complicated by a restricted range of |t| in many cases. Thus, we simpliﬁed the model
in Sec. 2 and included the EDDA Collaboration data [48] (E =0.23 – 2.59 GeV, θc.m. =30◦ – 90◦) in
our analysis. Including the data, we artiﬁcially added optical points calculated using σtot and ρ. This
allowed us to clarify the behaviour of the ﬁt parameters in the energy range 1.5 – 3 GeV.

In Sec. 3 we turn to analysis of np elastic scattering data, and obtain analogous results. A short

conclusion is presented at the end of the paper.

1 Standard parameterization of pp elastic scattering data

The amplitude of elastic proton-proton scattering must be symmetric at t ↔ u, where t and u are
Mandelstam variables. Thus, we write it as F (t) = f (t)+f (u) and an expression for ﬁtting the diﬀerential
cross sections can be represented as:

dσ/dt = A2 (eBt/2 + eBu/2)2.

(4)

It is obvious, that the parameterization can be applied at a deﬁned region of 4-momentum transfer,
t. The region must not include a region where the Coulomb interaction dominates. Thus, we excluded
experimental data with |t| < 0.005 (GeV/c)2. The width of the region must be suﬃciently large, because
each data set can be ﬁt with Eq. 4 for a narrow range of t. We choose a maximum value of |t| equal to
0.125 (GeV/c)2 as in paper [49]. Results1) of the ﬁtting with these restrictions are presented in Fig. 1.

As seen, the parameter A grows, starting from E ≃ 600 MeV, reaches a maximum at E ≃ 1000 MeV and
decreases at higher energy (see Fig. 1a). Results for the COSY data are in a good agreement with the
other existing data. A direct ﬁt to the EDDA data [48] gives acceptable results at E ≤ 1000 MeV. At
higher E, the parameter A decreases, reﬂecting the fact that small angle points are absent in the data.
The parameter B grows for E ≥ 600 MeV, and then sharply decreases above E ≃ 1000 MeV and
continues smooth growth with further increase of the energy (see Fig. 1b). Our ﬁt results are in agreement
with previous ones [49]. The COSY data clarify the behaviour at E = 1 – 2.8 GeV. The EDDA data
cannot be used to determine these parameters for Plab > 1.7 GeV/c, because they don’t contain points
with suﬃciently small momentum transfer.

The parameter A must be connected with σtot

We did not try to extend our parameterization for ρpp below 1 GeV, because the behavior of the ρpp

data is unclear for these energies.

ρpp = −q16π (A/σtot

The latest COSY data [37] helped to estimate ρpp in the energy range 1 – 3 GeV. According to Eq. 3,
pp )2 − 1. We calculated ρpp using the ﬁt results for A and the approximation for σtot
pp
according to Eq. 5. The calculations are presented in Fig. 2 by stars. They clarify the behavior of ρpp at
energies below 3 GeV. After that, we determined parameters of the approximation in Eq. 6.

Having the approximations in Eqs. 5 and 6, we can now check Eq. 3 in the energy range under study.
The estimated values of A are presented by the solid line in Fig. 1a. As seen, the estimations are in
reasonably good agreement with the ﬁt results for E ≤ 7 GeV. The estimations are below the ﬁt results
by 5 – 10 % for E = 7 – 25 GeV. This can be connected with overestimation of ρpp in the energy region:
ρpp ≃ −0.35 according to the Eq. 6. It is suﬃcient to reach an agreement between the estimations and
the ﬁt results for A to decrease ρpp down to -0.45 as it was for the COSY energies. Thus, we believe that
ρpp can have a non-trivial behavior in this energy region. It could be a main reason why the high energy
approximation cannot be extended in the low energy domain.

Of course, that disagreement could result from an over-simpliﬁed exponential expression. We evaluate

this hypothesis in the next section.

It is useful to have an approximation of the energy dependence of the parameter B for the Glauber

calculations of the diﬀerential cross sections. We parameterize the ﬁt results for B by the formula:

B = 1.9 ln(s/s0) +

Calculations by the formula are shown by a dashed line in Fig. 1b.

Using the approximated values for A and B, we calculate the elastic cross sections (σel

pp = |A|2/B)
presented in Fig. 1c by a solid line. As expected, the calculations somewhat underestimate the cross
sections. To show this, we ﬁt the elastic cross sections with this expression:

2 Two exponential parameterization of pp data

In order to describe experimental data over a wide range of t, let us consider the two exponential param-
eterization

dσ
dt

= |A1 eB1t/2 + A2eiφ eB2t/2|2,

(12)

where A1, B1, A2, B2 and φ are real numbers. It was proposed in Ref. [38] for an analysis of anti-proton-
proton elastic scattering data and was also applied in papers [39, 40, 41] for a description of a wide set
of ¯pp data in the energy range 0.5 – 15 GeV.
It was independently proposed by R.J.N. Phillips and V.D. Barger [43] in 1973. The authors of the
paper [43] analyzed only pp experimental data at Plab =12, 14.2, 19.2, 24, 29.7 GeV/c and at √spp = 53
GeV for the range 0.15 < |t| < 5 (GeV/c)2.
We used this paramterization to ﬁt the studied experimental data at 0.005 < |t| < 5 (GeV/c)2. Results
of the ﬁt are presented in Tab. 1. The values of the parameters at the two restrictions on t (0.15 < |t| and
0.005 < |t|) diﬀer by no more than 10 %. The typical diﬀerence is about 5 %. Our restriction allowed
additional data sets to be included in the ﬁtting procedure.
A constraint on the parameters has been imposed as in Ref. [41]. This is necessary because Eq. 12
contains 5 parameters, and there is often a strong correlation of the parameters. Due to this, the ﬁt does
not converge sometimes in the studied energy range. Thus, we have to introduce a constraint in order to
reduce the number of the parameters. Three of them were considered in Ref. [41]: B1 = 10 (GeV/c)−2,

42 %, φ – in the range ± 16 %. Considering the ﬁt results with the simple exponential expression (see
Fig. 1b), it is diﬃcult to assume that B1 is a constant in the studied energy range. B2/B1 varies too
strongly. Thus, we assume that φ is approximately constant and set it to an average value from Tab. 1,
φ =1.94 rad, at Plab ≤ 50 GeV/c. We repeat the ﬁt with φ constant. Results of the ﬁt are given in Tab. 2
and presented in Fig. 3 by solid points.

As seen in Fig. 3, the results for the data at Plab =5.5 GeV/c [53] and 10 GeV/c [58] are far away from
other results. This is because the data at 5.5 GeV/c have no points at small |t|, |t| ≥ 0.66 (GeV/c)2 in the
data (see Fig. 4a). Thus, the parameters A1 and B1 cannot be determined correctly. The experimental
data at Plab =5.5 GeV/c and data at Plab =5.0 GeV/c [52] are plotted in Fig. 4a . The last data have
points at small |t| but do not have enough points at large |t|.
A more complicated situation occurs at Plab =10 GeV/c [58]. We compare those data with data at 9.9
GeV/c [56] in Fig. 4b. As seen, the data at 10 GeV/c do not have enough points at low |t|. In addition
to this, the points at 10 GeV/c ﬂuctuate more strongly than the data at 9.9 GeV/c. All of these reﬂect
on the ﬁt results.

To clarify the parameter’s behaviour at Plab <3 GeV/c, we have included the EDDA data into the ﬁt.
The ﬁt does not converge because the data only contain diﬀerential cross section values at large scattering
angles. To overcome the problem, we added values of dσ/dt at t = 0 in the data. dσ/dt at t = 0 were
calculated using σtot
pp and ρpp according to Eq. 5 and 6. Errors of the values were set 0.5 %. Results of
the ﬁtting are presented in Fig. 3 by open points.

Now, approximations of the energy dependence of A1, A2, B1 and B2 are needed for future calculations.
[45, 47]. According to the

A ﬁt to high energy data (√s > 23 GeV) to Eq. 12 has been done in Refs.
papers, A1 and B1 smoothly grow in the range 23 < √s ≤ 7000 GeV. A2 and B2 have more complicated

behaviour, however simple dependencies were proposed in Ref.[47]:

A1 = a (s/s0)−ǫ1 + b (s/s0)ǫ2 , A2 = c (s/s0)−ǫ3 + d (s/s0)ǫ4 ,

B1 = b0 + b1 ln (s/s0), B2 = b2 + b3 ln (s/s0).

(13)

(14)

We were not able to select the parameters of Eq. 14 in the studied energy range. Thus, we changed the
expressions for B1 and B2.

B1 = b0 (s/s0)−ǫ5 + b1 (s/s0)ǫ6 , B2 = b2 (s/s0)−ǫ7 + b3 (s/s0)ǫ8 .

A careful selection of the parameters of the expressions resulted in:

a = 10.6 [fm/(GeV/c)],

ǫ1 = 0.9, b = 1.55 [fm/(GeV/c)],

ǫ2 = 0.1

c = 290 [fm/(GeV/c)],
b0 = 6.8 [(GeV/c)−2],
b2 = 2700 [(GeV/c)−2],

ǫ3 = 3,

ǫ5 = 0.,

ǫ7 = 4,

d = 0.05 [fm/(GeV/c)],
b1 = 0.035 [(GeV/c)−2],
b3 = 0.6 [(GeV/c)−2],

ǫ4 = 0.1

ǫ6 = 1.0

ǫ8 = 0.25

Having the approximations, we can corroborate the self-consistency of the ﬁt. Neglecting the t ↔ u
symmetry at suﬃciently high energies, a general form of the two exponential parameterization can be
represented as

F (t) = eiφ0 [A1 eB1t/2 + A2eiφ eB2t/2].

are our approximations for pp interactions. Dashed (blue) lines are calculations (see the text).

np , σel

General properties of the np interaction – σtot

np and ρnp, together with our approximations for pp
collisions are presented in Fig. 5. As seen, the total np cross section values are lower than the pp values
at Plab = 1.2 – 3.4 GeV/c. They are close to each other at higher energies. The data on total cross
sections of pn and np interactions are diﬀerent in the region Plab = 1.2 – 2.2 GeV/c. It is explained by
diﬀerent methods of their measurements and a complicated structure of diﬀerential cross sections. We
will not consider the diﬀerence in detail, but we will assume that the pn data are more precise than np
ones.

As also seen in the ﬁgure, the total elastic scattering cross sections for np interactions are larger than
the analogous data for pp collisions at Plab ≤ 3.2 – 3.4 GeV/c. Data on ρ = Re(F (0))/Im(F (0)) for np
interactions are not enough for a solid conclusion, though they are in a common agreement with pp data.
So, we have to assume that ρnp = ρpp.

Because the properties of np interactions are similar to pp interactions, we approximate the energy

dependencies of σtot

We start out by describing the np diﬀerential cross sections with the standard one exponential pa-
rameterization. Using a restriction on |t| as in the case of pp scattering (|t| < 0.125 (GeV/c)2) we found
only one data set [64] at Plab = 0.924 – 1.793 GeV/c where the needed points were presented. It was not
enough for the ﬁt. We tried to change the upper limit of |t| to 0.25 (GeV/c)2 using the data [64] – [71] but
we were not satisﬁed by the ﬁt results because they could not allow to determine the energy dependence of
the parameters. Various restrictions on ﬁt range of t were used in the literature [65, 68, 66, 72, 73]. Very
often a value of 0.5 (GeV/c)2 was considered as the maximum |t|. Fit results of Eq. 1 to the experimental
data with this value are shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 6: Fit results of Eq. 1 to np diﬀerential elastic scattering cross sections [64] – [71] at |t| < 0.5
(GeV/c)2. Points are the ﬁt results. Solid lines are approximations. For a description of the dashed line
see the text.

As seen, there are three problems: 1 – the parameter A at Plab =0.924 GeV/c is much larger than the
parameters at similar momenta; 2 – points at Plab =1.97 – 6.77 GeV/c have large error bars; 3 – values of
A at Plab =23 and 25 GeV/c are lower than the other values. In addition, the point at Plab =23 GeV/c
has large error bars, and there is a large χ2/N DF = 7.82 at Plab =9 GeV/c. The problematic points are
marked by arrows in Fig. 6.

The large error bars at Plab =1.97 – 6.77 GeV/c are connected with small number of experimental
points included in the ﬁt, only 4 points for each data set. The same is true at Plab =23 GeV/c. Only 5
data points were considered at the ﬁt. Of course, the number of included data points can be increased
by increasing the maximum value of the allowed |t| range, but this eﬀects the values of B.
A more complicated situation takes place with other problems (see Fig. 7). Fluctuation of experimental
data points [64] at Plab =0.924 and 1.065 GeV/c presented in Fig. 7a are comparable with each other.
Relative error bars of the data are also comparable. Only essential diﬀerence is the magnitudes. The
diﬀerence was noted in Ref. [64], but no explanation was given. The data at Plab =0.924 GeV/c also are
above the phase-shift analysis results as shown in Ref. [64]. Thus, we decided to exclude the ﬁt results
at Plab =0.924 GeV/c from our consideration.

We show experimental data [69] at Plab =15, 25 and 35 GeV/c together with ﬁt results in Fig. 7b. As
seen, the slope parameter increases going from 15 to 35 GeV/c. The B values at 15 and 25 GeV/c are
comparable. At the same time the maximum value of dσ/dt (at |t| < 0.23 (GeV/c)2) decreases going from
15 to 25 GeV/c, and suddenly increases going to 35 GeV/c. This behavior was not noted in Ref. [69].
Maybe it was not essential because the absolute normalization error was estimated to be ∼ 35% [69]. We
did not consider systematic errors in our ﬁt. Because the ﬁt results at Plab =25 GeV/c fall outside of the
common trend, we do not take them into account.

We show in Fig. 7c experimental data [67] at two close momenta, 9 and 10 GeV/c, and our ﬁt results.
As seen, the data are similar, except data points at |t| =0.13 and 0.145 (GeV/c)2 at Plab =9 GeV/c
(marked by arrows). They give the largest contribution to χ2. The other point of such type is marked

The ﬁt results are connected with the fundamental properties of np interactions – σtot

np/(4√π). The calculations with the
ρnp. According to Eq. 3, A can be calculated as A = σtot
assumption ρnp = ρpp are shown in Fig. 6a by the dashed line. As seen, the calculations deviate from
the ﬁt results, especially at Plab ≤ 10 GeV/c. We used Eq. 23 as an approximation for σtot
np , and Eq. 6
for ρnp. At the same time, we can calculate ρnp using Eq. 23 and an approximation for A.

(25)

The calculations are shown by dashed lines in Fig. 5. As seen, the estimation of ρnp diﬀers from ρpp. So,
our results show that a standard assumption, ρnp = ρpp, is not correct.

Having A and B, we can estimate σel

np as A2/B. To do this, we approximate B by the following

formula:

B = 6.2 + 0.7 ln(s/s0) −

350

(s/s0)3

[(GeV/c)−2].

(26)

The estimation is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 5. As seen, it underestimates the cross section at
Plab ≤ 5 GeV/c. This was expected because the standard parameterization cannot describe the cross
sections at large momentum transfer. Thus, we consider the two exponential parameterization.
A typical diﬀerential cross section of np elastic scattering shown in Fig. 8a has two maxima at forward
and backward directions in the center-of-mass system, at t ∼ 0 and t ∼ tmax. The backward peak appears
due to the charge exchange reaction, n + p → p + n. It is assumed that the peak is connected with π-
meson exchange in the t channel (see references in [74]). The peak is located at |u| < 0.025 (GeV/c)2
(u = tmax− t), and it is much smaller than the forward one. Thus, we will not consider it in the following.
The forward peak is located at |t| ≤ 0.5 (GeV/c)2 [67]. There is a slope break at |t| ∼ 1.5 (GeV/c)2,
and a plateau at 0.3 · |tmax| ≤ |t| ≤ 0.7 · |tmax|. It is obvious, that the two exponential parameterization
cannot describe the plateau. Thus, we modify the parameterization to be:

dσ
dt

= |A1 eB1t/2 + eiφ[A2 eB2t/2 + A3]|2.

(27)

A ﬁt of Eq. 27 to the experimental data of Refs. [66, 67] at 0.3 · |tmax| ≤ |t| ≤ 0.7 · |tmax| and
A1 = A2 = 0 shows that the height of the plateau decreases as the energy grows, and can be described
by:

A3 = 2000/(s/s0)4.75

[fm/(GeV/c)].

(28)

The plateau corresponds to the isotropic scattering in the center-of-mass system. Its yields in the

diﬀerential cross sections are shown in Fig. 8a by solid and dashed lines.

As seen in Fig. 8b, the ﬁt results to the data [66, 67] are diﬀerent. To understand a source of the
diﬀerence we plotted in Fig. 8a the diﬀerential cross sections of Refs. [66, 67] at similar projectile momenta.
As seen, the data of Ref. [66] are less precise than the data of Ref. [67] in the region of the plateau. The

9

data in [66] vary more stronger than the data in [67]. The data are quite close to each other only at
Plab ∼ 5 GeV/c. Thus, we mainly followed the data of Ref. [67] to fulﬁll Eq. 28, shown in Fig. 8b by a
solid line.

A two exponential ﬁt of Eq. 27 to the data [64, 66, 67, 69, 70] using Eq. 28 gives meaningful results
only for 22 of 45 sets of data. It is explained by the strong correlation of the parameters. According to
the ﬁt, an average value of φ is equal to 1.6. In order to decrease the correlations, we ﬁxed φ to that
value. A new ﬁt allowed 39 data sets to be included. The ﬁt results are shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9: Fit results of Eq. 27 to the data [66]–[70]. Points are the ﬁt results. Stars are the results of
ﬁtting of Eq. 27 at A2 = 0 to the data [64]. Solid lines are approximations (see below). Dashed lines are
approximations of the A and B parameters of the one exponential expression.

The ﬁt to the data of Ref. [64] at Plab = 0.924 – 1.793 GeV/c gives too large values of A1 and B1,
which are needed to reproduce the data at |t| < 0.027 (GeV/c)2 (see Fig. 7a). The large values of A2 and
B2 of the ﬁt allow the data at |t| > 0.03 (GeV/c)2 to be described . The errors of the parameters are
also large. As seen in Fig. 7a, there is an empty region at 0.027 < |t| < 0.03 (GeV/c)2. We believe that
the region is a reﬂection of special features of the experiment, which also leads to a diﬀerence between
the cross sections before and after the region. Taking all of these points into account, we consider the ﬁt
results to be non-realistic, and we do not show them in Fig. 9.

At the same time, the data [64] are ﬁt quite well by Eq. 27 with A2 = 0 and A3 given by Eq. 28.

10

Those results are indicated by stars in Fig. 9. The parameters A1 and B1 in this case are rather close to
the results of the one exponential parameterization ﬁt.

The data of Ref. [66] at Plab = 1.97 and 2.51 GeV/c do not have suﬃcient points at large |t| (see
Fig. 10a) for a good determination of the parameters. Thus, we ﬁt Eq. 27 with A2 = 0 to them as before.
The ﬁt results are also shown in Fig. 9 by stars.

The ﬁt results of the data [66] at Plab =3.05, 3.57, 4.08, 4.59, 5.10, 6.12 and 6.77 GeV/c have large

error bars. The results are much better for the data [67] at Plab =5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 GeV/c.

The data of Ref. [69] at Plab = 15 GeV/c could not be ﬁtted at all due to the restricted range of t
(see Fig. 10e). The peculiarity of the data [69] at Plab = 25 GeV/c was considered before. They lead to
A2 and B2 which are outside the common regularity.

The restricted range of t reﬂected on the ﬁt results of data [70] at Plab = 100 GeV/c (see Fig. 10f).

At higher energies all parameters regularly decrease with encreasing energy, up to Plab = 360 GeV/c.

Figure 10: Description of np elastic diﬀerential cross sections by Eq. 27 with approximations 29 – 32.
Points are experimental data [66, 67, 69, 70]. Lines are calculation results.

Taking into account everything above, we propose the following approximation of the energy depen-

dence of the parameters:

A1 = 2.75 + 2.25 ps/s0 − 4.3

(s/s0 − 7)2 + 5 − 1.4 107/(s/s0)12

[fm/(GeV/c)],

A2 = 1.7 104 (s/s0 − 7)/(s/s0)5 + 0.04/[1.4 10−10(s/s0)4 + 1]

[fm/(GeV/c)],

B1 = 6.2 + 0.7 ln (s/s0) − 310/(s/s0)3

B2 = 2 10−4ps/s0 (715 − s/s0) + 80/(s/s0)1.5

[(GeV /c)−2],

[(GeV /c)−2].

They allow general features of the diﬀerential cross sections of np elastic scattering starting from 400
MeV up to 360 GeV to be described. The description is shown in Fig. 10. The total χ2/N DF for all
data sets is equal 20989/1290∼16. The systematic errors of the data are ∼ 20 – 30 %. The typical errors
of the cross sections are ∼ 5%. If we take into account the systematic errors, this decreases χ2/N DF by
about a factor 16 .
The worst χ2/N DF is observed for the data [70] at Plab ≥ 100 GeV/c. A separate ﬁt of the data
gives an acceptable χ2/N DF and A1 and B1 which deviate from the corresponding approximations in

11

the range by ± 5 %. Fitted values of A2 and B2 vary in a larger interval. Errors of A2 are on the level
∼ 25 %, and errors of B2 are on the level ∼ 50 – 70 %. It is understandable because the data do not
include points with large momentum transfer. Thus, A2 and B2 cannot be determined as well in the
energy range. At the same time, our approximations allow one to describe the forward peak.

Conclusion

• A general description of pp and np elastic scattering in the energy range 1 – 50 GeV has been

reached.

• 133 and 45 sets of experimental data on pp and np elastic scattering, respectively, were analyzed

and ﬁt.

• Two popular parametrizations of diﬀerential cross sections – a standard one exponential parameter-
ization and the two coherent exponential parameterization, were used whole ﬁtting the experimental
data.

• Analytical expressions to approximate the energy dependence of the ﬁt parameters were proposed.
• Approximations of σtot, σel and ρ have been also proposed.
All of these give a solid base for eﬀective Glauber calculations and Monte Carlo simulations of prop-
erties of nucleon-nucleon, nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions at high energies especially for
FAIR and NICA energies, and for RHIC Beam Energy Scan program.

The authors are thankful to D. Mchedlishvili for providing as with COSY data in a tabulated form,

and O.V. Selyugin and N.I. Kochelev for useful discussions of the subject of the paper.
