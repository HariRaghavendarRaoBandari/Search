ABSTRACT

Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are frequently observed in various magnetic struc-
tures of the solar atmosphere. They may contribute signiﬁcantly to coronal heating and could
be used as a tool to diagnose the solar plasma. In this study, we synthesise the Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A
emission of a coronal loop supporting a standing kink MHD mode. The kink MHD wave solution
of a plasma cylinder is mapped into a semi-torus structure to simulate a curved coronal loop. We
decompose the solution into a quasi-rigid kink motion and a quadrupole term, which dominate
the plasma inside and outside the ﬂux tube, respectively. At the loop edges, the line-of-sight in-
tegrates relatively more ambient plasma, and the background emission becomes signiﬁcant. The
plasma motion associated with the quadrupole term causes spectral line broadening and emission
suppression. The periodic intensity suppression will modulate the integrated intensity and the
eﬀective loop width, which both exhibit oscillatory variations at half of the kink period. The
quadrupole term can be directly observed as a pendular motion at front view.

Introduction

In the past decade, signiﬁcant progress has
been achieved in probing the heating and seis-
mological roles of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
waves in the solar atmosphere (see reviews by
Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005; Liu & Ofman
2014; Jess et al. 2015; Arregui 2015). Among
the MHD wave modes, the slow magnetoacous-
tic mode propagates anisotropically in a low β
uniform plasma; the wave energy ﬂows predomi-
nantly along the magnetic ﬁeld line, e.g., De Moor-

tel et al. (2002a,b); Wang et al. (2009a,b); Yuan
& Nakariakov (2012); Kumar et al. (2013, 2015);
Fang et al. (2015). While fast magnetoacoustic
mode could propagate to any direction relative
to the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., either parallel, perpen-
dicular or oblique, therefore, they are commonly
waveguided in a variety of magnetic structures
through reﬂections and refractions. They may
couple with Alfv´en wave and exhibit mixed wave
properties in forms of standing transverse oscil-
lations of coronal loops (Aschwanden & Schrijver
2011; Nistic`o et al. 2013; Verwichte et al. 2013a);
large-scale coronal propagating fronts across the
whole solar disk (Ofman & Thompson 2002; Liu
et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2015); quasi-periodic fast
wave trains along magnetic funnels (Liu et al.
2012; Yuan et al. 2013; Pascoe et al. 2013; Nistic`o
et al. 2014b); fast wave pulses across randomly
structured plasma (Yuan et al. 2015a); ubiqui-

1

tous propagating kink waves in the entire corona
(Tomczyk et al. 2007) and coronal holes (Thur-
good et al. 2014; Morton et al. 2015).

Kink waves (the m = 1 mode, Edwin & Roberts
1982, 1983; Ruderman 2003; Erd´elyi & Morton
2009; Goossens et al. 2014) were initially ob-
served in active region loops in the Extreme Ul-
traviolet (EUV) channels of the Transition Re-
gion and Coronal Explorer (TRACE, Nakariakov
et al. 1999; Aschwanden et al. 1999). The coro-
nal loops were observed to oscillate transversely
with amplitudes at megametre scale in response
to ﬂares, i.e., the associated mass ejections (Schri-
jver et al. 2002; Zimovets & Nakariakov 2015), ﬁla-
ment destabilizations (Schrijver et al. 2002), mag-
netic reconnection (He et al. 2009), or vortex shed-
ding (Nakariakov et al. 2009). Recently, Nistic`o
et al. (2013) and Anﬁnogentov et al. (2013) de-
tected low-amplitude (sub-megametre scale) kink
oscillations of coronal loops. Kink waves in this
category last for dozens of wave cycles without
signiﬁcant damping, and are apparently not as-
sociated with any explosive events (Anﬁnogentov
et al. 2013). Transverse oscillatory motions were
also observed in chromospheric spicules (Okamoto
& De Pontieu 2011; Morton 2014), chromospheric
mottles (Kuridze et al. 2012), ﬁlament threads
(Lin et al. 2007, 2009), large prominences (Tri-
pathi et al. 2009; Hershaw et al. 2011; Arregui
et al. 2012), polar plumes (Thurgood et al. 2014),
coronal rain (Antolin & Verwichte 2011), helmet
streamers (Chen et al. 2010, 2011), and even coro-
nal mass ejections (Lee et al. 2015).

Fundamental (global) standing kink modes are
frequently observed in closed coronal loops (Van
Doorsselaere et al. 2009; Ruderman & Erd´elyi
2009). The period of coronal transverse waves
ranges from 2 min to 33 min; and the damp-
ing time has a similar time scale (Aschwanden
et al. 2002; White & Verwichte 2012). The curved
coronal
loops are normally assumed to be ap-
proximately co-planar; the loop plane intrinsically
deﬁnes horizontally and vertically polarized kink
waves about the loop axis (Ruderman 2009). Hor-
izontal kink waves are more frequently observed,
e.g., Nakariakov et al. (1999); Schrijver et al.
(2002); Aschwanden et al. (2002); Zimovets &
Nakariakov (2015); while vertical kink waves were
only reported in a limited number of cases, e.g.,
Wang & Solanki (2004); Verwichte et al. (2006);

Selwa et al. (2007, 2010, 2011); White et al. (2012);
Kim et al. (2014).

The main interest in standing kink modes of
coronal loops arises mainly from their role in di-
agnosing the coronal plasma via MHD seismol-
ogy (Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005; De Moortel
& Nakariakov 2012). The standing kink mode
could be used as a tool to infer magnetic ﬁeld
strength along a coronal loop (Nakariakov & Of-
man 2001; Verwichte et al. 2009, 2010, 2013a).
Verwichte et al. (2013b) measured the range of the
density contrast and inhomogeneity layer thick-
ness of coronal loops based on the period-damping
time scaling law. De Moortel & Pascoe (2009) are
the ﬁrst to validate MHD seismology with three-
dimensional numerical simulations, and showed
that the inverted magnetic ﬁeld strength agrees
with the input magnetic ﬁeld within a factor of
about two. Aschwanden & Schrijver (2011) and
Verwichte et al. (2013a) compared the seismo-
logical ﬁeld and the Alfv´en-transit-time-averaged
value in the potential ﬁeld model, and found con-
sistency within an order of magnitude. Chen &
Peter (2015) performed MHD simulations using a
realistic coronal model, and found that the excited
coronal loop oscillations would be eﬀectively used
to infer the average magnetic ﬁeld.

Kink MHD waves are highly-incompressible in
the long wavelength limit and exhibit only quasi-
rigid motions (Goossens et al. 2012). Indeed, in
a coronal loop the density (or temperature) per-
turbation by a kink mode is at the order of 10−3
or less of the equilibrium value. The observed in-
tensity variations of coronal loops (e.g., O’Shea
et al. 2007; Verwichte et al. 2009, 2010) are as-
cribed to the column depth modulation introduced
by the kink motion. Cooper et al. (2003a,b) per-
formed line-of-sight (LOS) integration through the
coronal loop plasma perturbed by MHD waves
and demonstrated that intensity modulation could
become signiﬁcant in case of a kink mode, even
though the plasma ﬂuid compression is negligible.
Recently, Goossens et al. (2014) showed that
the kink mode solution could be decomposed into
a quasi-rigid transverse motion and a rotational
motion, which is detectable as Doppler velocity
oscillations in optically thick lines.
It confronts
interpreting rotational motion as a signature of
Alfv´en wave (De Pontieu et al. 2012). Therefore,
forward modelling would signiﬁcantly advance the

2

knowledge of kink modes and resolve the dispute
on whether a wave with observed rotational mo-
tion is a kink or Alfv´en wave (e.g., Van Doors-
selaere et al. 2008). Moreover, MHD seismology
and wave energy estimation strongly rely on cor-
rect identiﬁcation of the wave mode and accurate
measurements of wave properties (Goossens et al.
2012; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2014).

Forward modelling is a novel approach that syn-
thesizes the plasma emission observables (Antolin
& Van Doorsselaere 2013; Yuan et al. 2015b). It
basically converts analytical or numerical models
into observables. Therefore, the inversion process
(e.g., MHD seismology, MHD spectroscopy, helio-
seismology, x-ray tomography), which is originally
ill-posed owing to the lack of suﬃcient constraints
(or observables), could be better understood in the
sense that knowledge of plasma properties is given
a priori. Gruszecki et al. (2012) studied the geo-
metric integration of the plasma density of a fast
sausage mode of a plasma cylinder. De Moortel &
Bradshaw (2008) demonstrated that the damping
rate measured in EUV emission intensity oscilla-
tions may not reﬂect the real damping of MHD
waves. Antolin & Van Doorsselaere (2013) and
Antolin et al. (2014) considered the inhomogen-
uous plasma emission introduced by fast sausage
modes and found that the LOS eﬀect and spa-
tial resolution would signiﬁcantly modify the as-
sociated EUV emissions of coronal loops. Yuan
et al. (2015b) found that the contribution func-
tion of atomic emission (Dere et al. 1997) could
cause emission asymmetry for positive and neg-
ative temperature perturbations, and could even
lead to the detection of half periodicity.

In this study, we present the forward mod-
elling study of standing kink modes of coronal
loops. Section 2 gives the analytical solution of
kink mode in a coronal loop and the numerical dis-
cretization for the forward modelling code1. Sec-
tion 3 and Section 4 present the results and con-
clusion, respectively.

2.1. Standing kink mode

In this paper, we study the standing kink
wave in a plasma cylinder embedded in a uniform
plasma. The magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the axis
of the plasma cylinder (i.e., z-axis), B0 = B0ˆz.
The equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld B0, plasma den-
sity ρ0 and temperature T0 are piecewise functions
of the r-coordinate:

B0, ρ0, T0 =(cid:26) Bi, ρi, Ti, for r ≤ a

Be, ρe, Te, for r > a,

(1)

where a is the radius of the loop. Hereafter, we
use subscript ‘i’ and ‘e’ to diﬀerentiate the internal
and external equilibrium values of the loop system.
The linearised ideal MHD equations give the
perturbed quantities that deviate from the mag-
netostatic equilibrium (see, e.g., Ruderman &
Erd´elyi 2009):

the perturbed plasma density, pressure and mag-

total pressure, µ0 is the magnetic permeability in
free space. A few typical speeds are deﬁned to

ωT = CTk are the corresponding acoustic, Alfv´en,
and tube frequencies, where k = πn/L0 is the lon-
gitudinal wavenumber, n is the longitudinal mode
number (n = 1 corresponds to the fundamental
mode), L0 is the length of the loop, γ = 5/3 is the
adiabatic index.

The boundary value problem (Equation 2-5) is
solved in cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) with the

We could see that the plasma motion is predom-
inantly polarised along the x-direction described
by the J0 term (also see Appendix A and Goossens
et al. 2014). The quadrupole terms J2 cos(2φ) and
J2 sin(2φ) may contribute to the ﬁne structuring
of coronal loops associated with kink modes. The
vertically polarised transverse mode could be eas-
ily obtained by replacing φ with φ + π/2, while
keeping the coordinate system intact.

where PT and ξr are the total pressure and the

In the case of
the standing kink mode (m = 1), we Fourier-
analyse the perturbed quantities by assuming
PT1 = AR(r) cos(ωt) sin(kz) cos(φ), where A is
the amplitude of the perturbed total pressure. The
longitudinal proﬁle sin(kz) ensures that the trans-
verse displacement follows a sin kz-distribution,
and therefore has a maximum at the loop apex for
the fundamental mode (n = 1).

In the thin ﬂux tube limit (ka ≪ 1), J0 =
1 + O((ka)2) for r < a, and K0/K2 ≪ 1 for
r > a, so the polarized quasi-rigid motion is al-
most conﬁned within the tube r < a (Figure 1b).
The quadrupole term is of secondary eﬀect, as
J2 = O((ka)2) for r < a, whereas at r > a,
K2/K0 ≫ 1, so it dominates the surrounding
plasma (Figure 1c). But we shall note that the
quadrupole term is only a second order term in-
side the tube, whereas at the ambient plasma, its
magnitude is of the ﬁrst order.

2.1.1. Correction for advected plasma motion

Equations 14-18 are solutions in Lagrangian co-
ordinates, while we need to synthesize observables
at a ﬁxed LOS (Eulerian coordinates), therefore,
the Lagrangian variables are remapped into Eule-
rian coordinates. The transverse displacement of a
kink mode is of the order of the loop radius a (As-
chwanden et al. 2002), and therefore, the advected
motion cannot be neglected. The displacement
ξ for the plasma ﬂuid at initial position [r, φ, z]
could be obtained by integrating the velocity with
respect to time t.

ξr = −ˆvr/ω cos(ωt) sin(kz) cos φ,
ξφ = −ˆvφ/ω cos(ωt) sin(kz) sin φ,
ξz = −ˆvz/ω cos(ωt) cos(kz) cos φ.

(33)

(34)
(35)

In Cartesian coordinates,
given as,

the displacement is

ξx = ˜ξx cos(ωt) sin(kz),
ξy = ˜ξy cos(ωt) sin(kz),

(36)

(37)

where [ ˜ξx, ˜ξy]T = −[˜vx, ˜vy]T/ω. Then the new po-
sition [˜x, ˜y, ˜z]T of the plasma ﬂuid originally at
[x, y, z]T = [r cos φ, r sin φ, z]T is

˜x(t) = x + ξx(t),
˜y(t) = y + ξy(t),
˜z(t) = z + ξz(t).

(38)
(39)

(40)

Thus, the plasma properties (e.g.
ρ0 + ρ1) at
location [x, y, z]T will be moved to the position
[˜x, ˜y, ˜z]T.

2.1.2. Mapping into a semi-torus structure

Fig. 2.— Schematic drawing illustrates how the
cylinder is mapped into a semi-torus and the LOS
angle deﬁnition. The pink plane (y1z1 plane) is
deﬁned by the loop spine. The green plane forms
an angle of τ with the pink plane; and their line
of intersection is parallel with the z1-axis. The
LOS is free to vary within the green plane and
quantiﬁed by an angle η + π/2 relative to the z1-
axis or the line of intersection. A LOS angle is
denoted as [τ, η].

The loop curvature was found to have a sec-
ondary eﬀect on the transverse motion of coronal

5

loops (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2009), and therefore
we only consider the LOS eﬀect and plasma inho-
mogeneities by mapping the kink mode solution
of a plasma cylinder into a semi-torus structure
(see Figure 2). The kink mode displaces the axis
of the loop, therefore, it has a polarisation rela-
tive to the plane deﬁned by the static curved loop
axis, i.e., the y1z1 plane. It is deﬁned as a hori-
zontal kink mode if the loop oscillates out of the
y1z1 plane (e.g., Nakariakov et al. 1999; Aschwan-
den et al. 1999). Or otherwise, if the transverse
motion of the loop axis is within the y1z1 plane,
it is termed as a vertical kink mode (e.g., Wang &
Solanki 2004; Verwichte et al. 2006).

After correcting the advected motion, we map
the plasma coordinates and the associated plasma
parameters into a semi-torus structure (Figure 2).
The plasma cylinder is bent into a torus within the
y1z1 plane, using the following transform (also see
Kuznetsov et al. 2015):

x1 = x,
y1 = (R + y) sin ζ,
z1 = −(R + y) cos ζ,

(41)

(42)
(43)

where ζ = z/R, and R = L/π.

This is basically a rotation of the velocity vector

varies within [−π/2, π/2] for z ∈ [0, L].
2.2. Coronal loop model


 . (44)

Coronal

loops are highly complex and dy-
namic structures, observed within a broad range
see a review by Reale
of plasma conditions,
(2014). The loop width varies from a few hundreds
(Brooks et al. 2013; Morton & McLaughlin 2013)
to dozens of thousands kilometres (Aschwanden
et al. 2002; Aschwanden & Nightingale 2005; As-
chwanden & Schrijver 2011). A coronal loop may
have multi-thermal (Nistic`o et al. 2014a), multi-
stranded structures (Scullion et al. 2014; Peter
et al. 2013), and may be associated with heat-
ing and ﬂows (Klimchuk 2006; Hood et al. 2009;
Winebarger et al. 2002). In our study, these ﬁne

6

structures are not considered; and the gravita-
tional stratiﬁcation is also neglected. Numerical
simulations are required to model these features
of coronal loop oscillations.

A coronal loop is set up in an equilibrium state.
The loop measures L0 = 100 Mm in length and
a = 4 Mm in radius. The loop density and tem-
perature are ρi = 2.5 · 10−12 kg · m−3 (nei =
1.5·109 cm−3) and Ti = 0.8 MK, respectively. The
internal plasma is permeated by a uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld Bi = 15 G. We choose a density and
temperature ratio of ρi/ρe = 5 and Ti/Te = 1.5,
respectively, then the magnetic ﬁeld strength ratio
is obtained by balancing the total pressure at the
loop boundary. The plasma beta gives βi = 0.037
and βe = 0.0048 for the internal and external
plasma, respectively. The corresponding acoustic
speeds are Csi = 150 km s−1 and Cse = 120 km s−1,
while the Alfv´en speeds are CAi = 840 km s−1 and
CAe = 1900 km s−1. These parameters are com-
monly observed in coronal loops (e.g., Reale 2014;
Aschwanden & Boerner 2011).

For the fundamental mode (n = 1),

the
wavelength is much longer than the loop radius
(ka = 0.13). The dispersion relationship (Equa-
tion 13) ﬁnds a kink mode solution with a pe-
riod at P0 = 3.0 min (ω = 0.034). We choose
Ai = 0.15 Pa, so that the velocity perturbation
amplitude is about 55 km s−1, and the amplitude
of displacement about 1.6 Mm (0.4a). The kink
mode could be considered as highly incompress-
ible (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008; Goossens et al.
2012), the density (temperature) perturbation
is about 0.4% (0.3%) of the equilibrium value.
These parameters are commonly observed by the
TRACE and SDO/AIA instruments (Aschwanden
et al. 2002; Aschwanden & Schrijver 2011).

2.3. Forward model

The loop system was discretised as given by
Equations 14-18 in Cartesian coordinates. We cal-
culate the plasma properties in a domain of x(y) ∈
[−2a, 2a] and z ∈ [0, L0] with 160× 160× 400 grid
cells. Forward modelling was performed with a
ﬁxed output mesh grid Nx2 × Ny2 = 170 × 3402
(see details in Yuan et al. 2015b). In contrast to
compressive MHD modes (Antolin & Van Doorsse-
laere 2013; Reznikova et al. 2014, 2015; Kuznetsov

2We refer to the projected output plane as x2y2 plane.

et al. 2015; Yuan et al. 2015b), the kink mode only
perturbs the density and temperature to the or-
der of 10−3-10−4 of the equilibrium values, there-
fore the eﬀect of the contribution function is of
secondary order. The spatial distributions of the
plasma properties play a key role in determining
the observational features. So we only present the
synthetic emission of the Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A line,
however, the results should be applicable to other
optically thin lines. The Fe XII λ193.509 ˚A line
and the AIA 171 and 193 ˚A channel were also syn-
thesised, but they only produce redundant results.
The LOS is deﬁned with two independent an-
gles [τ, η] (see illustration in Figure 2), where τ is
the angle between the loop axis plane (pink plane
or y1z1-plane) and another plane (green plane),
which share a line of intersection parallel to the
z1-axis. The LOS forms an angle of η + π/2 rel-
ative to the z1-axis (or the line of intersection).
Hereafter, we name [0◦, 0◦] as top view, [0◦, 90◦]
as side view, [90◦, 0◦] as front view, and [45◦, 0◦]
as oblique view for reference. Figure 3 illustrates
the synthetic views in the Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A line
at selected viewing angles; while Figure 4 presents
the spectra of the Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A line along a
slice s perpendicular to the axis of the loop apex
at each viewing angle, which is comparable with
Figure 9 in Goossens et al. (2014). We note that
the loop cross-sectional proﬁle could by approxi-
mated by integrating the emissivity along a uni-

form media 2√a2 − r2, thus gives a non-Gaussian

proﬁle. However, a Gaussian proﬁle is normally
assumed and practically observed, e.g., Verwichte
et al. (2005); Aschwanden & Boerner (2011). It
implies that coronal loops could be multi-thermal
(e.g., Nistic`o et al. 2014a), multi-stranded (Peter
et al. 2013) or inhomogeneous (Van Doorsselaere
et al. 2004). However, the point spread function
may also play a role, especially in low resolution
instruments. Inhomogeneity in a coronal loop is
favoured by the resonant absorption theory (Ru-
derman & Roberts 2002; Van Doorsselaere et al.
2004; Okamoto et al. 2015; Antolin et al. 2015),
which is developed to explain the strong damping
of kink waves (Nakariakov et al. 1999).
In this
study, we do not consider the resonant absorption
layer.

3. Results

3.1. Top view

Figure 5 presents snapshots of the relative emis-
sion intensity I/Im, Doppler shift velocity vD and
line width w at top view, where Im is the max-
imum intensity of the synthetic image series in
each viewing angle. At top view, the loop oscil-
lates within the plane-of-sky, it is clearly seen in
the relative intensity, Doppler shift velocity, and
line width snapshots. The loop motion is not eﬀec-
tively observed in the Doppler shift, as the plasma
motion inside and outside the loop is perpendicu-
lar to the LOS.

Figure 6 shows the sit-and-stare mode of a spec-
trograph, e.g., Hinode/EIS, in the Fe IX λ171.073
˚A line. The time distance plot (see, e.g., Yuan &
Nakariakov 2012) is taken at a cut perpendicular
to the loop axis, see Figure 5. It clearly shows the
transverse loop motion with an amplitude of about
1.5 Mm (0.4a); the associated intensity modula-
tion is about 0.04.
Intriguingly, we also detect
loop width (Full-Width at Half-Maximum) varia-
tion between 7.0 Mm (1.7a) to 7.4 Mm (1.8a); the
amplitude is about 0.2 Mm, one order of magni-
tude smaller than the loop displacement. The pe-
riodicity of the loop width and intensity variation
is P0/2. The Doppler shift velocity vD is close to
zero both inside and outside the loop. Moreover,
one could also observe line broadening on the loop
periphery. The Doppler shift has the same period-
icity P0, but π/4 out of phase with the transverse
motion. The line width variation has a period of
P0/2, and oscillates with a phase of π/2 lagging be-
hind the loop intensity variation. Figure 4 (right
column) illustrates this eﬀect: the spectrum moves
as a whole in space due to the transverse motion,
however, the centroid of the spectrum remains un-
changed, i.e., vD ≃ 0 km s. At the loop periphery,
one could observe signiﬁcant periodic broadening.
The background emission, about 2% of the loop
emission, is associated with the quadrupole terms
in Equations 27 and 29 (see Appendix A for deriva-
tions).

3.2. Front view

At front view, the transverse motion is along
the LOS, so the measured loop displacement is
almost zero (Figure 7). The Doppler shift veloc-

7

ity and line width broadening at the loop edges
are detectable. The time-distance plot (Figure 8)
shows that the loop width oscillates with an am-
plitude of 0.1a and a period of P0/2. The ampli-
tude (about 0.1a) observed at front view is about
twice that (about 0.05a) measured at top view.
Again, we detect line width broadening at the pe-
riphery of the loop. This eﬀect may contribute
to the non-thermal broadening that has been ob-
served at the edge of active region loops (Doschek
et al. 2007). The associated Doppler shift (about
5 km s−1) of the ambient plasma still exists (Fig-
ure 8), however, in contrast to the apparent rota-
tional motion at top view, the oscillation resembles
a pendular motion relative to the loop oscillation.
Figure 4 (left column) illustrates this eﬀect: the
Doppler shift on the periphery of the loop oscil-
lates in anti-phase with the kink motion inside the
loop, but with an amplitude of about 10% of the
loop oscillation. This is consistent with Figure 9
in Goossens et al. (2014).

3.3. Oblique view

Oblique view (Figure 9) is the most frequently
encountered observation on the solar disk. Fig-
ure 10 shows the time-distance plot observed in the
Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A line. Loop oscillation features at
oblique view contain a mixture of the properties
observed at top and front views:
loop displace-
ment, intensity modulation and loop width vary
at moderate levels.

loop apex and the time series of the loop position,
width and intensity variations. The times series
of the transverse motion is close to a sinusoidal
proﬁle, while in other viewing angles the loop dis-
placement deviates signiﬁcantly from a harmonic
function. We note that at side view, the loop
width measures at ≃ 8 Mm (about 2a), whereas
other viewing angles normally do not reveal the
full width of the loop. The associated loop width
and intensity variations are very small.

3.4. Side view

4. Discussion and Conclusion

Side view and its varieties are the most proba-
ble viewing angles for oﬀ-limb coronal loops, see,
e.g., Verwichte et al. (2004). Figure 11 displays a
complete cycle of the standing kink wave at side
view. Loop displacement is optimal for observa-
tion in the intensity; while the Doppler shift is
very small. The line width does not exhibit sig-
niﬁcant spatial variation over the projected loop.
However, line broadening is signiﬁcantly measur-
able. The maximum line width broadening is not
located at the loop apex, this is because at the
apex the plasma motion is almost perpendicular,
rather than along the LOS, and the projected ﬂuid
motion is only signiﬁcant at some distance away
from the apex.

Figure 12 presents the time-distance plot at the

In this study, we discretised the fundamental
standing kink wave solution of a plasma cylinder,
corrected for the ﬂuid advection, and mapped the
solution into a semi-torus structure to simulate the
kink MHD mode of a curved coronal loop. Then,
we synthesised the EUV emission in the Fe IX
λ171.073 ˚A line and performed Gaussian ﬁts to the
spectra to obtain the observables, i.e., the emission
intensity, Doppler shift velocity and line width.

We ﬁnd that the cross-sectional intensity distri-
bution of a coronal loop ﬁlled with uniform plasma
does not follow a Gaussian proﬁle. It means com-
plex coronal loop structure has to be considered
to fully synthesize loop oscillations. More physics
is associated with loop inhomogeneities, i.e., reso-
nant absorption (Ruderman & Roberts 2002; Van

8

Doorsselaere et al. 2004), phase mixing (Heyvaerts
& Priest 1983), mode conversion (Pascoe et al.
2010, 2011, 2012).

Loop displacement could be observed in any
viewing angles, as long as the polarised motion
is not along the LOS. This is the intrinsic feature
of a kink MHD wave.

Since the density and temperature perturba-
tions are of the order of 10−3-10−4 of the equi-
librium values, the contribution function has a
negligible eﬀect on the loop intensity modula-
tion. The kink mode solution could be decom-
posed into a quasi-rigid transverse motion and a
quadrupole term. The quadrupole term appears
in both the vx and vy components of the trans-
verse velocity (Equations 27 and 29). The ﬂuid
elements at [r, φ] and [r,−φ] (or equally [r, φ]
and [r, π−φ]) outside the tube would period-
ically deform the r-shell in the Lagrangian
coordinate at the order of 2 J ′
1(|κri|a)
1(κrea) v00K2/ω
K ′
(see Equations 31 and 32), which is a few per-
cent of the loop radius a, if the amplitude of the
displacement is close to a. Moreover, the ﬂuid
elements at ±φ of the r-shell move to the oppo-
site directions (Figure 14), and thus cause spec-
tral line broadening. The broadening is also ac-
companied by intensity suppression as illustrated
in Figure 13. At front view, the emission sup-
pression at r = 0.8a is stronger than that at the
loop axis. The quadrupole term eﬀect only be-
comes signiﬁcant at loop edges, where the LOS
integrates through more ambient plasma, and has
smaller impact on the spectrum at the loop axis as
the major contribution are from the plasma inside
the tube.

Line width broadening is usually measured in
the periphery of the loop, where ambient plasma
emission is signiﬁcant.
It is associated with the
cos(2θ) and sin(2θ) terms in Equation 27 and 29.
The line broadening is observed at all views. Fig-
ure 14 illustrates the reason: at front view vx could
vary from positive to negative along a LOS at loop
edge; whereas at top view, vy is anti-symmetric
about the xz-plane. This is consistent with the
case of a vertical transverse wave (Van Doorsse-
laere & Nakariakov 2008). Doschek et al. (2007)
reported non-thermal broadening at the edge of
active region loops, and it may be connected with
kink mode perturbations in the loops. However,

since there is no report of the associated transverse
motion, it may imply that coronal loops have un-
resolved low-amplitude motion similar to Nistic`o
et al. (2013) and Anﬁnogentov et al. (2013).

The intensity modulation at the loop axis is
usually detectable. This is diﬀerent with Cooper
et al. (2003a,b), which only consider static plasma
emission. In our study, both the spectrum modi-
ﬁcation by the MHD wave motion are considered
and measured as what would occur in realistic ob-
servations. This factor could contribute to the in-
tegrated LOS intensity variation at the loop axis.
At front view and its varieties, a pendular mo-
tion is observed. At front view, the transverse
motion of the loop could be fully observed along
the LOS, while the background emission oscillates
at an amplitude of a few percent of the loop oscil-
lation amplitude.

It is intriguing that coronal loop is observed
to have an apparent periodic expansion and
contraction when undergoing a kink MHD mode
wave. The optimal viewing angle to observe this
eﬀect is the front view. The amplitude of the loop
width variation is about 20-30% of the transverse
loop motion. At top view, the loop width varia-
tion is about half of the amplitude measured at
front view. At side view, this eﬀect could not be
observed. The loop deformation introduced by the
quadrupole terms alone is not fully responsible for
the loop width variation at such amplitude. The
line width broadening would result in emission in-
tensity suppression at loop edges, and therefore,
the eﬀective width of the loop measured in the
emission intensity proﬁle is smaller. In such a sce-
nario, one detects eﬀective loop width modulation
associated with the periodic re-distribution of the
intensity across the loop. Aschwanden & Schrijver
(2011) reported loop cross-sectional variations in
a vertically polarised standing kink mode and in-
terpreted it as a signature of coupled kink and
sausage mode. In our simulation, we predict that
loop width oscillates at a similar amplitude, but
with half the period of the kink mode. According
to our modelling, Aschwanden & Schrijver (2011)
may have observed an overlap of a steady loop and
an oscillating loop of similar density and tempera-
ture distribution. Therefore, the loop width vari-
ation could be accurately measured. The second
paper (Yuan & Van Doorsselaere 2016) in this se-
ries will present the modelling details of this event.

9

In our loop system, the plasma emission of
the coronal loop is about two orders of magni-
tude larger than the background.
If the back-
ground emission becomes comparable to that of
the loop, the spectroscopic measurement is still
valid to some extent (Yuan et al. 2015b). How-
ever, one may opt to use another spectral line that
is much more sensitive to the plasma emission of
interest.

The resolution of the forward models in each
view is better than current instruments, i.e., Hin-
ode/EIS. Therefore, to predict the possible obser-
vations with EIS, we degrade the resolution to
EIS level (1′′) by averaging with the neighbour-
ing pixel. The red time series in Figures 6, 8,
10, and 12, represent the possible sit-and-stare
observations with EIS. The loop width is gener-
ally measured to be smaller with low-resolution
instruments; while the other parameters appear
to be a smoothed version of those measured with
high-resolution instruments, e.g., the SPICE in-
strument onboard the Solar Orbiter.

In this study, we only consider a speciﬁc case of
a standing kink wave in a coronal loop and syn-
thesise the Fe IX λ171.073 ˚A emissions. However,
it should be generally applicable to other opti-
cally thin emission lines, because in the kink MHD
mode, the perturbations to the density and tem-
perature are very tiny. Therefore the spatial dis-
tribution of the velocity ﬁeld plays a determining
role in the observational signatures.

A. Derivation of the quadrupole terms

We deﬁne λ = κrr and R′(λ) = dR/dλ. For the plasma motion inside the loop r < a:

where we used J ′
same procedure and used K ′
the plasma motion outside the loop r > a:

1(λ) = J1/λ − J2 and J2 = 2J1/λ − J0 (Olver et al. 2010) in the derivation. We follow the
1 = K1/λ − K2 and K2 = 2K1/λ + K0 (Olver et al. 2010). Then we obtained

If we use the relationship J ′
verify that ˜vx|r=a− = ˜vx|r=a+ at φ = 0 and π.

1 = 0.5(J0 − J2) and K ′

If one follows the same procedure and uses the relationships (J ′
et al. 2010), then one could easily obtain the vertical component:

1 = −0.5(K0 + K2) (Olver et al. 2010), then we could

1 = J1/η − J2 and K ′

1 = K1/η − K2, Olver
