Abstract

Geometric phases describe how in a continuous-time dynamical system the displacement
of a variable (called phase variable) can be related to other variables (shape variables)
undergoing a cyclic motion, according to an area rule. The aim of this paper is to show that
geometric phases can exist also for discrete-time systems, and even when the cycles in shape
space have zero area. A context in which this principle can be applied is stock trading. A
zero-area cycle in shape space represents the type of trading operations normally carried out
by high-frequency traders (entering and exiting a position on a fast time-scale), while the
phase variable represents the cash balance of a trader. Under the assumption that trading
impacts stock prices, even zero-area cyclic trading operations can induce geometric phases,
i.e., proﬁts or losses, without aﬀecting the stock quote.

1 Introduction

Geometric phases are “cycles that eﬀect changes” [1]. They appear in systems in which a cyclic
change in some of the variables (called shape variables) induces a non-zero net motion on other
variables (called phase variables). They are well studied phenomena for instance in classical
and quantum mechanics [2, 3, 4], molecular systems, [5], robotics [6, 7] and control theory [8].
They explain how a falling cat can manage to land always on its feet [9], how a bacterium can
propel itself in a highly viscous ﬂuid [10], and how we can parallel park a car [11], see [12] for
an overview.

Originally introduced in quantum physics by Berry [13], they are normally used in con-
junction with nonintegrable systems of continuous-time diﬀerential equations. When a cyclic
trajectory is generated in shape space, nonintegrability of the ODEs induces a motion which
is non-periodic in phase space, see Fig. 1 (a). The amplitude of this phase displacement is
proportional to the area of the cyclic path in shape space. In particular, a zero-area cycle yields
no geometric phase.

There is however a case in which even a zero-area cycle can induce a nontrivial geometric
phase, and it is when we consider diﬀerence equations in discrete time. Some of the peculiarities
of nonintegrable discrete-time dynamical systems have been known since several decades in
control theory [14, 15]. However, in our knowledge, the properties of discrete time geometric
phases have never been investigated, let alone the existence of phase motions induced by zero-
area shape cycles.

The aim of this paper is to shown that indeed such geometric phases exist, and to present
an application where they admit a useful interpretation. The application we want to discuss
is stock trading. In the idealized stock exchange we consider, we can take as shape variables

1

the amount of a certain stock owned by a trader and the quote of that stock. The discrete
events which constitute the time instants of interest for our model are the trading events that
concern the stock we are dealing with. Using a discrete-time dynamics for them is natural,
especially when fast time scales are considered. The phase variable is the cash balance of our
trader, which is a function of how many stocks are bough/sold but also of the quote at which
they are bought/sold. The product of these two quantities gives the nonlinearity required to
have a nonintegrable system of diﬀerence equations. Assume that our trader is the only actor in
our stock market, and that his market orders are executed against a limit order book [16, 17].
Assume further that trading impacts prices, i.e., a buy order drives prices up, while a sell order
drives prices down. When nothing else happens to our stock, a zero-area cyclic trajectory in
shape space is a sequence of a buy order followed by a sell order of equal magnitude, see Fig. 1
(b). At the end of the cycle, the stock quote (a shape variable) is unchanged, as the two price
impacts compensate each other. However the cash balance of the trader (the phase variable)
is not zero at the end of the cycle. In fact, the quote at which the stocks are bought does not
contain the price variation due to the action of buying itself. However, this price impact is
incorporated in the quote at selling time, which makes the quote at which stocks are sold higher
than that at which the stocks are bought, as an eﬀect of the act of trading itself. This is the
geometric phase of stock trading.

In what follows an idealized scenario is presented ﬁrst, as a way to shown that nontrivial
geometric phases for zero-area shape trajectories indeed exist. The scenario is then rendered
more realistic by incorporating in the model a bid/ask spread for the stock quote, commission
fees, and a stock quote drift (representing the operations of all other traders of the same stock),
without altering the nature of the geometric phase phenomenon just described.

Entering and liquidating a position, possibly very quickly, is the typical pattern of high-
frequency trading (i.e., fast computerized trading with short holding periods and no inventory
[18, 19, 20, 21]). It is shown in the paper that practices like front-running, sometimes attributed
to high-frequency trading [22], consist in interlacing fast cycles with operations of slower “clas-
sical” traders, and are essentially a way of increasing the price impact (and hence the geometric
phase) during a cycle in shape space.

2 Models

Consider an idealized “stock exchange” scenario consisting of a single trader trading on a single
stock through market orders, executed against a limit order book ([16], more details are given
below). Denote y(t) the quantity of stocks owned by the trader at time t and with s(t) the
stock quote. When the trader buys or sell stocks, his cash balance z(t) changes accordingly.

We make the assumption that trades impact prices: selling stocks drives prices down, while
buying stocks drives prices up. In discrete time an elementary model for the scenario being
considered is the following:

y(ti+1) = y(ti) + u(ti)
s(ti+1) = s(ti) + ru(ti)
z(ti+1) = z(ti) − s(ti)u(ti).

(1)

(2)

(3)
Here u(ti) = y(ti+1)−y(ti) is the amount of stock being bought (u(ti) > 0) or sold (u(ti) < 0) at
time ti by the trader. At time of execution, a buy order (u(ti) > 0) raises the quote of the stock,
i.e., s(ti+1) > s(ti), while the cash balance decreases z(ti+1) < z(ti). The events represented
by (1)–(3) all have the same time stamp ti, meaning that for all 3 equations the variables are

be very small, provided that ∆ti > 0. The coeﬃcient r quantiﬁes the price impact, i.e., how
inﬂuential an order is for a certain stock. Its value (here assumed constant) may depend on
the total volume of the stock, its liquidity, volatility, etc [23], see also below for a more general

Assume that the trader performs a cyclic operation, consisting in buying a certain amount
k of stocks at time tb and then reselling them at a later time ts. The time unfolding of events
for this “buy-then-sell” cycle is shown in Fig. 2, panels (a) and (b). Denote t = 0 the starting
time, and tend any time larger that ts. The buy-then-sell cycle corresponds to the input pattern

buy-then-sell cycle. Panel (b): corresponding shape and phase space proﬁles. At time tb = 20
the trader buys a unit of stock. The stock quote s increases consequently because of the price
impact of the operation, while the cash balance z becomes negative. At time ts = 80 the stock
is sold and the stock quote returns to the level it had at t = 0. However, the cash balance z
becomes positive because the stock is sold at a price higher than it was bought. The shape
trajectory of the variables (y, s) is cyclic and has zero area (orange curve in panel (b)). The
phase variable z experiences a net displacement because of the cycle, i.e., a geometric phase is
produced (blue curve in panel (b); the starting point is the green dot and the ﬁnal point is the
red dot). Panels (c) and (d): When the stock quote is allowed to drift because of the operations
of other traders, then periodic operations of a trader no longer result in cyclic trajectories
in shape space (y, s). However a geometric phase in the z variable is still present and keeps
building up whenever the trader completes a cycle of operations. In panel (c), the plot for s
shows in black the stock quote in absence of trading cycles, and in red the deviations due to
these trading cycles, visible only during the intervals in which stocks are hold (or shorted, for
sell-then-buy cycles).

y(tend) = y(0). When no other operation happens during the time interval then also s(tend) =
s(0). However, if r > 0, the cash balance is positive, i.e, z(tend) = z(0) + rk2 > z(0). Such a
positive cash balance is solely due to the price impact of the transactions being made by our
trader. It is proportional to the square of the number of stocks traded. A similar result occurs
for a sell-then-buy cycle, which also leads to z(tend) > z(0), see Fig. 3. In both cases, while

dot in panel (b) is above the green dot), because the stock is bought at a lower price than it
was sold.

y(t) and s(t) accomplishes a cyclic trajectory returning to their starting point, z(t) does not.
The key in understanding why a nonzero cash ﬂow is generated by cyclic operations lies in the
nonlinearity of the diﬀerence equation (3), namely s(t)u(t) is a bilinear term, i.e., linear, but
simultaneously so, in both state and input. This nonlinearity introduces a behavior which is
typical of nonintegrable vector ﬁelds [8, 7].

The classical description of geometric phase deals with nonlinear continuous-time vector
ﬁelds, in which 2 or more of the variables (corresponding to our y(t) and s(t)) evolve on a
shape space, and the remaining variables (here z(t)) on a phase space above the shape space,
see Fig. 1(a). Cyclic trajectories in shape space yield a net motion on the phase variable which
is proportional to the area of the cyclic shape trajectory and it is zero when this area is zero,
see Fig. S5.

In discrete-time, however, the picture is diﬀerent. As shown in Fig. 2 and as computed
explicitly in (6), even a zero-area cyclic trajectory in shape space yields a non-zero motion on
the phase variable. In our speciﬁc example, the origin of the positive cash ﬂow induced by a
cyclic trajectory (entering then exiting a position) is due to the fact that stocks are bought at
a lower price s(tb) and are sold at a higher price s(ts), see Fig. 2. The price increase is due to
our assumption that stock trades impact stock quotes. The argument is analogous if the cycle
consists of a sell-then-buy: in this case the quote at selling time is higher than that at buying
time, see Fig. 3.

Eﬀect of a market drift. Let us now consider a scenario in which the stock price is driven
by the operations of our trader but also by a random variable {w(ti)} ∈ N (0, σ) representing
the trading operations of all other traders of the stock we are considering. The system (1)-(3)

where we still assume that operations of our trader are cyclic and follow (5), but eq. (8) has an

i.e., the stock trend in the hold interval [tb, ts] also aﬀects the cash ﬂow of our trader, but only
as a ﬁrst order term of the number of stocks held during the cycle, as opposed to the second
order term of the noncommutative eﬀect. Iterating over many cyclic operations of our trader,
initiated at time instants {tb} drawn from a Poissson process, and drawing also {ts − tb} from a
Poisson distribution of shorter mean arrival time, then the stochastic diﬀerence equation (7)-(9)
is such that at tend, y(tend) = y(0), while instead now the stock quote has a nontrivial trend
s(tend) (cid:54)= s(0). From (10), the inﬂuence of the stock trend on the cash balance can be made
small by reducing the length of the time interval [tb, ts], so that regardless of the value of the
drift term {w(ti)}, it is possible to obtain z(tend) > z(0) = 0. Hence, provided that a cycle
is completed at suﬃciently high frequency, the price impact induced by the cycle itself can
still dominate the trend imposed by the market. A sample trajectory depicting this situation
is shown in Fig. 2 (c) and (d). In panel (c), in the plot of s, the stock quote driven only by
{w(ti)} is shown in black. The red deviations appearing in the plot correspond to the price
impact of the operations carried out by our trader. In fact, combining (6) and (10) for a single
buy-then-sell cycle the value of s in the holding interval [tb, ts] is given by

i−1(cid:88)

i..e, the extra term rk must be added to {w(ti)}.

j=b

Eﬀect of bid-ask spread.
In real stock exchanges a buy (market) order is compared with
a limit order book: the limit order with best ask price is matched to the market order, and if
needed the book is “walked” to the next ask oﬀer and so on until the order is completely executed
(order redirection towards other stock exchanges is neglected here) [16, 17]. Consequently the
spread between the best ask and best bid price increases and the midprice (which in our model
is the stock quote) is pushed up. If nothing else happens after the execution of the order, then
when trying to complete the cycle the best bid price is unchanged (and below both the new
and old original stock quote), hence the cycle results in a net loss rather than a proﬁt as we are
showing here, see Fig. 4. However if the market has suﬃcient depth and the bid-ask spread is
small and remains small throughout the process, for instance because new limit orders on both
ask and bid side keep arriving (“locked” or “nearly locked” markets), then it may still happen
that a raising stock price drives the new best bid price above the old ask price (value at which
the stock was bought), see Fig. 5.

Assume that the stock quote s(ti) is equal to the midprice between best ask a(ti) and best
bid b(ti) prices, and that the bid-ask spread q around s(ti) is constant (i.e., a(ti) = s(ti) + q/2,

Figure 4: Eﬀect of a wide bid-ask spread. The buy order empties the shaded red region of the
ask side of the limit order book. The stock quote (midprice) consequently increases, while the
best bid price (blue) remains unchanged. The sell order needed to complete the cycle settles at
a price below the original buy price, hence the cycle results in a net loss for the trader.

Figure 5: Eﬀect of a small bid-ask spread. In a deep market with many buy and sell orders
arriving continuously, the spread remains small around the midprice, even after the execution
of the buy order has raised the stock quote. Hence the price impact of the buy order can lead
to a new best bid price which is above the quote at which the buy order was executed. In this
case, completing the cycle indeed results in a net gain.

and b(ti) = s(ti) − q/2). To take into account the bid-ask spread in our model, eq. (3) must be
replaced by

z(ti+1) = z(ti) − v(ti)u(ti)

where v(ti) =

(cid:40)

a(ti)
b(ti)

if u(ti) > 0
if u(ti) < 0.

(11)

At the end of the cycle, the cash balance from (11) is z(tend) = z(0) + rk2 − qk. If we include
also a fee for each trading operation (assumed constant and equal to c), then

z(tend) = z(0) + rk2 − qk − 2c.

(12)
Hence a cycle yields a net proﬁt if z(tend)−z(0) = rk2−qk−2c > 0. See Fig. 6 for an example of
how spread can reduce gains (or induce losses) in z(t). In (12), if the market is deep enough and
the spread limited enough, then z(tend) − z(0) can be made positive by choosing a suﬃciently
high value for k. Regardless of its sign, the quantity z(tend) − z(0) is still a geometric phase,
representing proﬁt when z(tend) − z(0) > 0 or losses when z(tend) − z(0) < 0.

Figure 6: Spread reduces proﬁts (or induces losses). Panel (a): In (12), the presence of a quote
spread decreases the value of z(tend) − z(0). In the plot for z, if the green curve corresponds to
q = c = 0, the magenta and brown curves correspond to diﬀerent choices of these parameters.
Depending on the values of r, q and c, the geometric phase can correspond to a proﬁt (green
and magenta curves), or to a loss (brown). The geometric phase (and the corresponding proﬁts
or losses) accumulates over repeated trading cycles (panel (b)). For short trading cycles the
presence of a stock drift (panel (b)) does not alter the result.

In presence of a drift term {w(ti)} for the stock price as in (7)-(9), the cash balance can be

modiﬁed according to (10) as

As already mentioned, when the hold interval [tb, ts] is short, so is the eﬀect of the drift term
i=b w(ti)k on the ﬁnal value of the cash balance. Fig. 7 shows the value of z(tend) as we
vary the number of trading cycles and the average duration of the hold intervals for a large
number of realizations {w(ti)}. When in a formula like (12) the geometric phase is positive
(z(tend) > z(0)), then even in presence of drift the cash ﬂow remains positive at least as long as
[tb, ts] is suﬃciently short compared to σ. Short-lived deviations in the stock quote are enough
to manifest the noncommutativity eﬀect we are describing here. In Fig. 7, notice how rather
than to the quote drift, z(tend) is correlated to the number of trading cycles carried out in
[0, tend] (which follows from r being a constant).

Eﬀect of more complex price impact formulas. All models discussed in the paper make
use of a linear and constant formula for describing the price impact of trading operations on
the stock quote. However, any nonlinear function of the trader’s orders can be used instead of
(2) , for instance

where r(u) is any time-invariant function of u such that

s(ti+1) = s(ti) + r(u(ti))

(cid:40)

r(u) > 0
r(u) < 0

if u > 0
if u < 0.

(13)

(14)

If r(·) is an odd function, i.e., r(−u) = −r(u), then the neutrality of the stock quote to cyclic
trades is preserved, that is, in absence of drift s(tend) = s(0) and our arguments are still valid.

Figure 7: Endpoint of a series of cyclic trading operations, in presence of stock quote spread and
quote drift. Each dot is the result of 1000 simulations, under the assumption that z(tend)−z(0) ≥
0 when the stock drift is absent (formula (12)). The number of cyclic operations is considered
itself a random variable (denoted “n. of trade cycles”), and so is the duration of the holding
intervals [tb, ts] (denoted “mean duration of cycle”). For short cycles (with respect to the
standard deviation σ of the stock drift term), the trader always obtains a proﬁt (panel (a)).
The proﬁt is proportional to the number of trade cycles performed by the trader (panel (b)).
The correlation tends to get lost when the mean duration of the trade cycles becomes large
(red dots in panels (b) and (c)). For short cycles, the proﬁt happens independently of the stock
trend (blue dots in panel (d)). Also when the trade cycles become long and proﬁt may be lost,
there is no signiﬁcant correlation between z and s (panel (d)).

For instance, combining (13)-(14) with the spread model (11) and the constant trading fee c
yields

Gaining phase by front-running an order. When multiple traders are considered simul-
taneously, an “easy” way to guarantee that a trader has a positive cash balance is to have
him front-run somebody’s else orders, a strategy sometimes imputed to certain aggressive high-
frequency traders [22]. Consider two traders, one “classical” (indexed by c) and one high-
frequency (indexed by h). Assume that each order entered by the classical trader is executed

Practically, this can be achieved by a com-
bination of colocalization and order rerouting among diﬀerent physical stock exchanges [22]. If
tcb and tcs are the execution times of the buy and sell order of the classical trader, then let
thb = tcb − τ1 and ths = tcb + τ2, τ1, τ2 > 0, be those of the high-frequency trader. As shown
in Fig. 8, a buy order initiated by the classical trader triggers a ﬁrst price increase at thb and
a second one at tcb. If the high-frequency trader resells his stocks right after tcb, then he can
beneﬁt (also) of this second price increase to make a proﬁt. Using equations similar to (1)–(3)

zh(tend) = zh(0) + rkh(kc + kh)

where kc and kh are the amount of stocks traded by the classical and high-frequency trader
during the cycle. From (18)-(19), it can be seen that for the classical trader the “beneﬁt” of
the geometric phase in terms of cash balance is eroded when a high-frequency trader front-runs
his orders. In particular, if the quantities traded by the two actors are equal, kh = kc, then

zc(tend) = zc(0)
zh(tend) = zh(0) + 2rk2
h

i.e., the price increase of the classical trader in cyclic operations is completely lost, to the beneﬁt
of the high-frequency trader. If instead kh > kc, then the cycle always results in a loss for the
classical trader: zc(tend) < zc(0). Analogous considerations apply to the more complex models
discussed in this paper, incorporating quote drift and quote spread.

3 Discussion

A continuous-time equivalent of the model (1)–(3) is presented in the Appendix. For it, a
periodic input trajectory induces a zero-area cyclic path in shape space, which however results
in no neat motion of the phase variable, see Fig. 9. Only when the area of the cyclic path in
shape space becomes nonzero a geometric phase can appear, but for that to happen we have to
modify the continuous-time model (for instance adding a time delay in the update law for the
stock quote, see Fig. S610). This conﬁrms that the geometric phase described in this paper is
intrinsically a discrete-time phenomenon, with no continuous-time counterpart.

Repeating a multitude of cycles on a fast time scale is a hallmark of high-frequency trading,
which nowadays in certain equity markets like the US stock market constitutes around 50% of
the total trading volume [18, 19, 21]. There is no consensus in the literature on what are the
sources of proﬁt of high frequency trading operations of this type [20, 21, 17, 24, 25], other than
“penny” proﬁts must accumulate from each trading cycle. What the existence of a geometric
phase suggests is that in principle tiny proﬁts (or losses, when z(tend) − z(0) < 0) can be

Figure 8: Front-running an order. A high-frequency trader that can anticipate the operations
of a slower classical trader can beneﬁt of the price impact created by the latter, in addition
to the one induced by his own trades. The geometric phase (and hence any possible proﬁt)
tends to swap from the classical trader to the high-frequency trader. For the classical trader,
the proﬁt in presence of a front-runner is reduced (blue curve in the lower plot of both panels)
with respect to the same curve in absence of front-run (magenta curve).

made through pure speculation, without holding any inventory position except for imperceptible
amounts of time.

If information on future market operations is available (like when speed is used to front-
run upcoming orders), then this can be used to increase the chances of making proﬁts by
incorporating the geometric phase induced by the operations of the trader being front-run into
that of the front-runner doing a cycle.

Another conceptual consideration that follows from our models is that, as long as one con-
siders cyclic operations, in principle proﬁts or losses can be made with stock trading in a way
that does not aﬀect the main observable of a stock market, namely the quote of a stock. Making
such proﬁts (or losses) does not require any knowledge of market fundamentals, as the geometric
phase just uses the price momentum induced by the act of trading itself, a bit like a self-fulﬁlling
prophecy. And this notwithstanding any “eﬃcient market” theory.

Appendix

Classical interpretation of geometric phase in continuous-time. The continuous-time
equivalent of (1)–(3) is the following system of ODEs:

˙y(t) = u(t)

˙s(t) = ru(t)
˙z(t) = −s(t)u(t).

The geometric interpretation of the result shown in Fig. 1 (a) for the model (20)-(22) is that

solution of (20)-(22), x(t) = π−1 (π(x(t)), i.e., the geometric phase variable z(t) corresponding

then the geometric phase (or “holonomy”, [3, 8]) of Γ is

the end of the cycle.
space S and does not produce any motion on the z variable, see Fig. 9.

Indeed in the system (20)-(22), a cyclic trajectory in u(t) induces a zero-area cycle in shape

In other words, the geometric phase described in the paper is a purely discrete-time phe-
nomenon, with no continous-time counterpart. In order to obtain a similar eﬀect in continuous-
time, it is necessary to produce cyclic trajectories of non-zero area in the shape space (y, s).
This can be achieved for instance by introducing a delay in the dynamics of s, representing a
latency time in the response of the stock quote to buy/sell orders. Such delays are plausible
if we focus on the very fast time scales preferred by high frequency traders. If we replace (21)
with

(24)
where τ > 0 is a time delay, then a periodic u-trajectory induces a nonzero area in the plane S,
and a net motion in the z variable is accumulated each time a cyclic trajectory is accomplished,
see Fig. 10.

˙s(t) = ru(t − τ )

As in the discrete-time case, it is possible to include in the model a spread between the buy
and sell prices. Considering a quote spread in the continuous-time model means replacing (22)
with

(cid:40)−a(t)u(t)

−b(t)u(t)

˙z(t) =

if u(t) > 0
if u(t) > 0

(25)

Since a spread reduces the proﬁt margins, in the delay-free continuous-time model (i.e., eq. (20),
(21) and (25)), it is impossible to attain a positive cash ﬂow out of cyclic operations only (unlike
in the discrete-time case), see Fig. 11.

This conﬁrms the qualitatively diﬀerent prediction given by discrete and continuous-time
models. Notice in Fig. 11 how a (negative) geometric phase is produced in spite of the zero-area
of the cycle in shape space. This is however a pathological behavior, due to the discontinuity
in the ODE (25), and comes at the price of loss of uniqueness of the solution of (25) when u(t)
crosses 0.

When also a delay is added to the continuous-time model (i.e., eq. (20), (24) and (25) are
considered), then a positive cash ﬂow is again possible, depending on the numerical values of
the parameters r, τ , and q, see Fig. 12.
