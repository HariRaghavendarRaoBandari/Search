ABSTRACT

In the third Fermi catalogue (3FGL) there are sixteen gamma-ray globular

clusters. After analyzing the recent released Pass 8 data of Fermi Large Area

Telescope (LAT), we report the discovery of signiﬁcant gamma-ray emission

from M 15 and NGC 6397, conﬁrm that NGC 5904 is a gamma-ray emitter and

ﬁnd evidence of gamma-ray emission from NGC 6218 and NGC 6139. Inter-

estingly, in the globular clusters M 15, NGC 6397 and NGC 5904, millisecond

pulsars (MSPs) have been found in radio or X-rays, which are strongly in

support of the MSP origin of the gamma-ray emission. However, due to the

relative low luminosity of the gamma-ray emission we do not ﬁnd any evidence

for the gamma-ray pulsation or ﬂux variability of these sources.

INTRODUCTION

Globular clusters (GCs) are nearly the oldest spherical stellar systems with ages greater than

1010 years in the Milky Way Galaxy and more than 150 GCs 1 have been detected in radio

and/or optical bands. The gamma-ray GCs however are much rare. Before the successful

performance of Fermi Larger Area Telescope (LAT, Atwood et al. 2009), it was essentially

unclear whether GCs consist of a new kind of gamma-ray emitters or not. GCs are composed

of a large number of stars, with higher stellar densities and more compactness in their cores.

Through frequent dynamical interactions (Verbunt & Hut 1987; Cheng & Taam 2003),

GCs have high stellar encounter rates, and are expected to form low-mass X-ray binaries

(LMXBs, Clark 1975; Katz 1975). LMXBs are progenitors of millisecond pulsars (MSPs,

Alpar et al. 1982). MSPs are believed to emit gamma-ray photons through curvature ra-

diation in the pulsar magnetosphere model or Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) between

surrounding soft photons (such as background star photons in the clusters, the galactic in-

frared photons, the cosmic microwave background photons and the galactic star photons)

and the energetic electrons/positrons (e.g., Cheng et al. 2010; Wei et al. 1996; Zhang et al.

2003; Harding et al. 2005; Venter et al. 2008; Bednarek & Sitarek 2007). It is generally be-

lieved that a large group of MSPs contribute to the majority of gamma-ray emission of GCs

(Abdo et al. 2010c). At the distance of several kpc, the gamma-ray ﬂux of an individual

MSP (Abdo et al. 2009a) is usually inferior to the point-source sensitivity of Fermi-LAT

and it can not be detected. Hence the gamma-rays from GC are most likely contributed by

an entire population of MSPs rather than a single one.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope was launched on June 11, 2008 (Atwood et al.

2009) and it scans the whole sky every three hours in survey mode. The LAT onboard

Fermi satellite is a pair-production telescope designed to collect gamma-rays in the en-

ergy range from about 20 MeV to above 500 GeV with unprecedented sensitivity. It has

been running over seven years and has revolutionized our understanding of the gamma-

ray emission from the GCs. In 3FGL (Acero et al. 2015) there are sixteen GCs, including

47 Tucanae (Abdo et al. 2009a), Terzan 5 (Kong et at. 2010), Omega Cen(Abdo et al.

2010a,c), NGC 6388, M 62, NGC 6440, NGC 6652 (Abdo et al. 2010c), NGC 6752, M 80,

NGC 6541 (Tam et al. 2011), NGC 6624 (Tam et al. 2011; Freire et al. 2011), 2MS-GC01

(Nolan et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2015), NGC 6717, NGC 6441, NGC 6316 and NGC 2808

(Acero et al. 2015). It is estimated that 80% of the detected MSPs are inside GCs 2. In

June 2015 the Fermi collaboration released their ﬁrst Pass 8 data. The changes included

new pattern recognition algorithm in the Tracker reconstruction, a clustering stage in the

Calorimeter reconstruction, better energy reconstruction, more gamma-ray events particu-

larly in the low energy range and so on 3. Motivated by such remarkable improvements, in

this work we re-analyze the GC sample of Zhou et al. (2015) to search for new gamma-ray

emitters.

This work is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the data analysis; in Section

3, we present the main results; a summary with some discussions is given in Section 4.

2 FERMI-LAT DATA ANALYSIS

2.1 Data preparation

The data in our analysis was collected from August 8th, 2008 to August 27th, 2015 with

energy range from 100 MeV to 500 GeV. We used the Fermi Science Tools version v10r0p5

package4 provided by the Fermi Science Support Center. We chose the Pass 8 data (evclass =

128 & evtype = 3) and only used the events with zenith angles 6 90◦ to minimize the contam-

ination from the Earth Limb. We used gtmktime to get high-quality data in the good time in-

tervals with expression recommended by the LAT team of (DATA QUAL>0)&&(LAT CONFIG==1).

The instrumental response function (IRF) we adopted here is ”P8R2 SOURCE V6”. To re-

duce the data, we follow the data analysis thread provided by the Fermi Science Support

Center5.

2.2 Analysis method

The events are selected from a 20◦×20◦ squared region of interest (ROI) with centered co-

ordinates listed Table 1 (just for the sources with signiﬁcant gamma-ray signal). We binned

the data with 25 logarithmical energy bins with spatial pixel size of 0.1◦ × 0.1◦. Using the

binned maximum likelihood method, we modeled the events composed of all known sources

included in 3FGL and two diﬀuse backgrounds in the ﬁeld. The two background templates

include Galactic (gll iem v06.ﬁts) and extragalactic (iso P8R2 SOURCE V6 v06.txt) diﬀuse

emissions, and we kept normalizations of them as free parameters. The model ﬁle was gen-

erated with make3FGLxml.py6. We used a single power-law (PL, dN/dE = N0E −Γ, N0 is

the normalization and Γ is the photon spectral index) or an exponential cut-oﬀ power-law

P. F. Zhang et al.

(PLE, dN/dE = N0E −Γe−E/Ec, Ec is the cut-oﬀ energy) as the spectral model of gamma-
ray GC candidates. Within 5◦ from the center of ROI, the normalization and the spectral

parameters of each source were set free. While for other sources located in the ROI, we only

free the normalization factors.

Zhou et al. (2015) carried out an systematic search of gamma-ray GCs. In addition to

the discovery of a few gamma-ray emitters, they found 31 sources with weak signals. In this

work, we re-analyze these tentative sources and focus on ﬁve sources with test statistic (TS)

values greater than 25 (i.e., the corresponding signiﬁcance is ∼ 4σ, Abdo et al. 2010b) and

normal photon spectral indexes (i.e., Γ 6 3). The TS value is deﬁned as TS= −2(L0 − L1),

where L0 and L1 are the logarithmic maximum likelihood values of null hypothesis and

tested model including the target source. We only ﬁnd ﬁve candidates, including NGC 5904,

M 15, NGC 6218, NGC 6139 and NGC 6397, for further analysis. We then use gttsmap

to generate their 5◦ × 5◦ residual TS maps (see Figure 1, each map is centered on the

nominal position of the GC from SIMBAD7). The gttsmap removes all sources that within

model ﬁle through a grid of locations on the sky and maximizing −log(Likelihood) at

each grid positions to identify weaker sources. We select events above 400 MeV for the

residual TS maps. In running gttsmap, we freeze all parameters of sources at the best-

ﬁt results of gtlike except the two diﬀuse backgrounds. In Nolan et al. (2012), the source

with a TScurve > 16 had been considered signiﬁcantly curved, where TScurve is deﬁned as

TScurve = 2(log L(curved spectrum) − log L(power − law)). But for the current ﬁve GCs we

have TScurve ≪ 16. Hence we use a power-law spectrum as the best-ﬁt model for each GC

(Note that we have also presented the PLE result for NGC 5904 to compare with the result

of Zhou et al. (2015)).

Using gtﬁndsrc we derive the positions of the gamma-ray sources, which are then found

to be within the tidal radii of NGC 5904, M 15, NGC 6218, NGC 6139 and NGC 6397,

respectively (see Fig.1). The association of these ﬁve gamma-ray emitters, not included in

3FGL, with the GCs is established. Following Tam et al.

(2011), we estimated the trial

factor to avoid fake signal with a number of search positions. In these 31 GC candidates,

we try to search the gamma-ray emissions and only ﬁve of them are further analyzed in

this work. So NGC is 31, and we use an averaged tidal radius 13′; Nbin is about 15 which
is derived by dividing the trial factor area of GC into 0.1◦×0.1◦ pixel. Our best-ﬁt results

are summarized in Table 2 with statistical errors only. Finally we can get the post-trail

signiﬁcance (see Table 2).

To obtain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with gtlike, we divided the energy

range into equal logarithmic spaced energy bins of these ﬁve GCs. In this step, we forze all

spectral parameters. By ﬁtting all model components, we got the ﬂux of target source in each

energy bin. We have also examined possible ﬂux variability, in which all data were binned

into 10 equal time bins. For each time bin, the ﬂux of target source was derived using gtlike.

Using a χ2 minimization procedure in this analysis, we ﬁt the lightcurves with a constant

ﬂux model. Since the dataset are binned into 10 bins, we have 9 degrees of freedom for each

globular cluster. If the value of reduced χ2

min above 25.26, we will claim that a signiﬁcant
variability of ﬂux was detected at the 99.73% conﬁdence levels (i.e., 3σ). The results of this

minimization are revealed in Section 3.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Signiﬁcant γ−ray detections

3.1.1 NGC 5904

Its tidal radius is 12.07′. The distance from the Sun is 7.5 kpc. Five pulsars were found in

this GC (Anderson et al. 1997; Hessels et al. 2007). With the Pass 8 data, we conﬁrmed

Zhou et al. (2015) that NGC 5904 is a gamma-ray emitter. We ﬁt the events above 100 MeV

of this GC with a power law spectrum model and get the best-ﬁtting photon spectral index

Γ of 2.40 ± 0.14. The TS value of NGC 5904 is 44, corresponding to a detection signiﬁcance

of 6.6σ (i.e., 5.3σ post-trial). The best-ﬁtting position (the results of gtf indsrc) of NGC

5904 is RA = 229.63◦ and Dec = 2.04◦(± 0.06◦, 1σ error) (J2000), which is oﬀset by 2.65

arcmin from the nominal position (RA = 229.64◦, Dec = 2.08◦), well within its tidal radius.

The integrated photon ﬂux above 100 MeV is F0.1−500 GeV = (5.94 ± 1.87) × 10−9 cm−2 s−1
and the integrated energy ﬂux is E0.1−500 GeV = (3.22 ± 0.60) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1; the
gamma-ray luminosity is L0.1−500 GeV = (2.18 ± 0.40) × 1034 erg s−1. These best-ﬁt results

are consistent with that of Zhou et al.

(2015). The reduced χ2

min of minimization of its

lightcurve is 16.97/9. We do not ﬁnd evidence for ﬂux variability at the conﬁdence level of

3σ. The residual TS map above 400 MeV of this GC is shown in Figure 1 (Upper left panel)

and its SED is shown in Figure 2 (Upper left panel).

3.1.2 M 15

There are eight radio pulsars in this GC. The tidal radius are 21.50′. Fitting the spectrum

with the power law model, we obtain an index (Γ) of 2.84 ± 0.18 and the TS value is

49 corresponding to a detection signiﬁcance of 7.0 σ (i.e., 5.7σ post-trial). The best-ﬁtting

position of M 15 is RA = 322.44◦, Dec = 12.13◦(±0.15◦) (J2000, the nominal position is

RA = 322.35◦, Dec = 12.1◦), which is oﬀset by 3.72 arcmin from M 15 core, well within

the tidal radius of M 15. The integrated photon ﬂux above 100 MeV is F0.1−500 GeV =
(11.84±2.48)×10−9 cm−2 s−1 and the integrated energy ﬂux is E0.1−500 GeV = (4.15±0.65)×
10−12 erg cm−2 s−1. At a distance of 10.3 kpc, the gamma-ray luminosity is L0.1−500 GeV =
(5.26+ 1.31
− 1.16) × 1034 erg s−1. With the ﬁrst year Fermi-LAT data, M 15 was not detected in
gamma-ray band by Abdo et al. (2010c, a small TS= 5.4 was reported) and an upper limit

was set by adopting a “typical” PLE spectrum. Thanks to the improved understanding of

the Galactic diﬀuse emission as well as the increase of the observation data, in this work M

15 was successfully identiﬁed as a γ-ray emitter. The residual TS map (between 400 MeV

and 500 GeV) of this GC is shown in Figure 1 (Upper right panel) and its SED is shown in

Figure 2 (Upper right panel). Although the best-ﬁt centroid does not exactly trace the pixel

with highest TS value due to statistic and systematic noise, the oﬀset is within 1σ error

circle and thus ignorable. The reduced χ2

min of minimization is 7.70/9, implying the absence

of variability at 3σ conﬁdence level.

3.1.3 NGC 6397

The global cluster NGC 6397 locates at 2.2 kpc from the Sun in the constellation Ara as

one of the two nearest globular clusters (the other is NGC 6121) to us. The age of this GC

is estimated to be 13.9 ± 1.1 billion years old (Gratton et al. 2003), almost the same as the

Universe. In this globular cluster, one radio pulsar has been detected. The nominal position

is RA = 265.18◦, Dec = −53.67◦ (l = 338.17◦, b = −11.96◦) and our best-ﬁtting position

is RA = 265.30◦, Dec = −53.66◦(± 0.06◦), which is oﬀset by 4.4 arcmin from its core, well

within the tidal radius of NGC 6397 (the tidal radius is 15.81′). The power-law spectrum ﬁt

yields an index Γ of 2.83 ± 0.17. The TS value of the gamma-ray signal is 49, corresponding

to a detection signiﬁcance of 7.0 σ (i.e., 5.7σ post-trial). The integrated photon ﬂux between

200 MeV and 500 GeV is F0.2−500 GeV = (4.94±0.88)×10−9 cm−2 s−1. The integrated energy
ﬂux is E0.2−500 GeV = (3.47 ± 0.54) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 and the gamma-ray luminosity is

L0.2−500 GeV = (0.20+ 0.15

− 0.12) × 1034 erg s−1. The reduced χ2

min is 11.97/9, implying the absence

of variability at 3σ conﬁdence level. The residual TS map above 400 MeV is shown in Figure 1

(Middle left panel) and its SED above 200 MeV is shown in Figure 2 (Middle right panel).

3.2 Possible γ−ray detections

3.2.1 NGC 6218

Its nominal position is RA = 251.81◦, Dec = −1.95◦ (l = 15.72◦, b = 26.31◦) and there is

no pulsar has been detected in this GC so far. Its tidal radius is 17.6′. Using gtlike, we ﬁt

the events with a single power law model and obtain a photon index of Γ = 2.28 ± 0.2.

Its TS value is 36, corresponding to a detection signiﬁcance of 6.0σ (i.g., 4.5σ post-trial).

The best-ﬁtting position, RA = 251.82◦ and Dec = −1.89◦(±0.04◦), which is oﬀset by 3.68

arcmin from its core, is well within the tidal radius circle of NGC 6218. Its integrated photon

and energy ﬂuxes (from 100 MeV to 500 GeV) are (5.28 ± 2.44) × 10−9 cm−2 s−1 and (3.46

± 0.73) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1, respectively. The gamma-ray luminosity of NGC 6218 is

L0.1−500GeV = (9.54 ± 2.0) × 1033 erg s−1 at a distance of 4.8 kpc. The residual TS map above

400 MeV is shown in Figure 1 (Middle right panel) and its SED above 200 MeV is shown

in Figure 2 (Middle right panel). The reduced χ2

min of minimization is 9.79/9, showing no

evidence for variability at 3σ conﬁdence level.

3.2.2 NGC 6139

Its tidal radius is 8.52′. No radio pulsar has been detected in this globular cluster. We ﬁnd

the evidence of gamma-ray emission in the tidal radius of NGC 6139 with TS value of 27

corresponding to a detection signiﬁcance of 5.2σ (i.g., 3.4σ post-trial). We ﬁt the events with

a single power law model and obtain the photon index Γ of 2.44 ± 0.12. The best-ﬁtting

position, RA = 246.92◦ and Dec = −38.88◦(±0.05◦), is oﬀset by 1.73 arcmin from its core,

well within the tidal radius circle of NGC 6139. The integrated photon ﬂux between 100

MeV and 500 GeV is F0.1−500 GeV = (9.56 ± 2.42) × 10−9 cm−2 s−1. The integrated energy
ﬂux is E0.1−500 GeV = (4.93 ± 0.86) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 and the gamma-ray luminosity is
L0.1−500 GeV = (5.21+ 2.28
− 1.78) × 1034 erg s−1 at a distance of 9.4 kpc. The decrease of the TS
value of NGC 6139 in comparison to that reported in Tam et al. (2011) could be due to the

“underestimate” of the Galactic diﬀuse emission in such a direction in the early version of

the Fermi-LAT science tool. Nevertheless, the spectral index as well as the ﬂuence reported

8

P. F. Zhang et al.

in Tam et al. (2011) are similar to ours. The residual TS map above 400 MeV is shown in

Figure 1 (Lower panel) and the SED above 100 MeV is shown in Figure 2 (Lower panel).

The reduced χ2

min of minimization of lightcurve is 4.98/9, without displaying any evidence

for variability at 3σ conﬁdence level.

4 DISCUSSION

We have systematically analysed the data from 31 GCs and ﬁnally found signiﬁcant gamma-

ray emission from ﬁve ones. We have discovered gamma-rays from NGC 5904, M 15 and

NGC 6397 that have post-trail signiﬁcance above 5σ. We have also found strong evidence of

gamma-ray emission from NGC 6218 and NGC 6139 (for which the post-trial signiﬁcance

are below 5σ and more data are needed to draw the ﬁnal conclusion). Among these ﬁve

GCs, the most distant object is M 15 (10.3 kpc), while NGC 6397 is the closest one (2.2

kpc). As shown in Fig.4 and Table 2, we do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences for the current

ﬁve gamma-ray GCs from the previous events in terms of gamma-ray luminosity, spectra,

number of known MSPs and other cluster properties. Except NGC 6139, the signiﬁcance of

the gamma-ray emission of NGC 5904 and M 15 increased signiﬁcantly thanks to the longer

exposure time and the remarkable improvements of Pass 8 data in comparison to Pass 7 data.

The higher TS value of gamma-ray emission from NGC 6139 found in 2011 is likely due to

the underestimated diﬀuse emission background contamination in that direction in previous

Fermi Pass 7 data. Since the majority of gamma-ray emission from GCs is widely believed

to be from a population of MSPs, we can estimate the number of MSPs in these GCs under

the assumption that each MSP emits similar amount of gamma-rays (Abdo et al. 2009b).

Following Abdo et al. (2009b), the total number of MSPs in a given GC NMSP is evaluated
by NMSP = Lγ/h ˙Eihηγi, where Lγ is the isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of the cluster;
h ˙Ei is the average spin-down power of MSP and hηγi is the estimated average spin-down

to gamma-ray luminosity conversion eﬃciency. Following Abdo et al. (2009b), we adopt a
value of h ˙Ei = (1.8 ± 0.7) × 1034 erg s−1 for all GCs and set hηγi = 0.08. With Lγ = 4πSd2

we get the isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of the cluster, where S is the observed energy

ﬂux and d is the distance from the Sun to the GC. These parameters are both summarized

in Table 2. The results of the estimated number of MSPs in each GC are also shown in

Table 2, which are more than that identiﬁed in radio and optical bands, implying that much

more MSPs would be identiﬁed in long-wavelength bands in the future.

Detection of gamma-ray emission from globular clusters

9

Using gtlike, we also separate each data set into 10 equal time bins for searching the

possible ﬂux variability for these ﬁve globular clusters. No signiﬁcant variability is obtained.

This can be understood since MSPs are stable in timescales much longer than their rotation

periods. Freire et al.

(2011) reported a high signiﬁcant gamma-ray pulsation from PSR

J1823-3021A in NGC 6624. We also searched for the gamma-ray pulsation in NGC 5904,

M 15 and NGC 6397 with the radio pulsar ephemeris. Using Tool TEMPO2 (Hobbs et al.

2006; Edwards et al. 2006) which is not associated with the FSSC, we fold the events from

the three GCs on every known radio pulsar ephemeris. The events are assigned phases base

on its arrival time to investigate a pulse proﬁle. We do not ﬁnd any evidence for the gamma-

ray pulsation. This is natural since usually individual MSP is too dim to be detected in

gamma-ray band and the detected signal in each GC is most likely from a group of MSPs,

for which the pulsation from individual MSP is smeared.

The detection prospect of gamma-ray emission from GCs depends on their gamma-ray
luminosities (i.e. the ˙E and gamma-ray eﬃciency) as well as their locations. It is generally

believed that Lγ correlates with the encounter rate Γc, the metallicity [Fe/H] (Hui et al.

2011), the number of MSPs, the shape of spectrum of source and the distance from us. In the

inverse Compton scattering model of gamma-ray GCs, Lγ is governed by the energy density

of the soft-photon ﬁeld at the cluster location (see Cheng et al. (2010)). To further check

these possibilities, we have a plot (i.e., Figure 3) following Hui et al. (2011). The current ﬁve

gamma-ray GCs ﬁt in the fundamental-plane relationships suggested in Hui et al. (2011).

An improved sample of γ-ray GCs can further test the correlation between the detected

gamma-ray luminosities and other properties of GCs, which may shed additional light on

the origin of GeV gamma-ray photons. For example, the tendency that the gamma-ray

luminosities increase with the energy densities of the soft photons, as shown in Figure 3, is in

support of the IC scattering mechanism (Cheng et al. 2010). Moreover, the locations of the

GCs are important. The higher the Galactic latitude, the lower the gamma-ray background.

Hence the sources at high Galactic latitudes are more easily to identify. That is why the

ﬁrst group of gamma-ray GCs were identiﬁed at relatively high Galactic latitudes while the

sources to be discovered were mainly in the Galactic plane. Nevertheless, the gamma-ray

GC sample is expected to grow up due to the continual successful operation of Fermi-

LAT and the ongoing observation of Dark Matter Particle Explorer (Chang 2014). With a

signiﬁcantly enhanced sample, some fundamental diﬀerences between the gamma-ray GCs

and non-detected ones, if there are, will be identiﬁed.

Figure 1. TS maps of 5◦×5◦ region for M 15, NGC 5904, NGC 6218, NGC 6139 and NGC 6397. The blue solid circles
represent the best-ﬁt centroid of the gamma-ray emission and their radii indicate the 1σ statistical error. The black dash circles
represent the tidal radii (Harris 1996, 2010 version) centered on the nominal locations of ﬁve globular clusters. These maps
are smoothed by Gaussian function whose kernel radius is 0.3◦.
