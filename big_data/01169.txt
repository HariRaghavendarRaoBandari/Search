Abstract

Microquasars [1, 2, 3, 4] are stellar-mass black holes accreting matter from a companion star [5] and ejecting
plasma jets at almost the speed of light. They are analogues of quasars that contain supermassive black holes
of 106 to 1010 solar masses. Accretion in microquasars varies on much shorter timescales than in quasars and
occasionally produces exceptionally bright X-ray ﬂares [6]. How the ﬂares are produced is unclear, as is the
mechanism for launching the relativistic jets and their composition. An emission line near 511 kiloelectronvolts
has long been sought in the emission spectrum of microquasars as evidence for the expected electron-positron
plasma. Transient high-energy spectral features have been reported in two objects [7, 8], but their positron
interpretation [9] remains contentious. Here we report observations of -ray emission from the microquasar V404
Cygni during a recent period of strong ﬂaring activity [10]. The emission spectrum around 511 kiloelectronvolts
shows clear signatures of variable positron annihilation, which implies a high rate of positron production. This
supports the earlier conjecture that microquasars may be the main sources of the electron-positron plasma re-
sponsible for the bright diﬀuse emission of annihilation -rays in the bulge region of our Galaxy [11]. Additionally,
microquasars could be the origin of the observed megaelectronvolt continuum excess in the inner Galaxy.

1 Main article

Flaring activity of V404 Cygni was discovered with the Swift/BAT and MAXI X-ray monitors [10], and observations
with INTEGRAL [12] started within two days, lasting from 17 to 30 June 2015. This recent activity period of
V404 Cygni - 11 days (15-26 June) - was shorter than its previous outbursts [13] in 1934 and 1989. The source
exhibited multiple ﬂares within hours, outshining [13] the brightest persistent X-ray source in the sky, the Crab
nebula, by factors of up to 40. V404 Cygni represents a gold standard for multi-wavelength observations, as the
parameters of the binary system are well known. It is composed of a 9-solar-mass black hole with a companion
star of 0.7 solar masses [14] in a 6.5-day orbit [15] and a 67 inclination angle [14] to the line of sight, and is located
at a distance of 2.4 kpc [16].

INTEGRAL/SPI spectrometer data were extracted and calibrated following the standard procedures, including
careful accounting for the detector response and background (see Methods section SPI data extraction). For spectral
analysis, the data have been summed into three epochs of ∼ 3 days during the V404 Cygni ﬂaring period. In each
of these three epochs (INTEGRAL orbits 1554, 1555 and 1557) we have detected a signiﬁcant excess of emission
around 511 keV, consistent with positron annihilation.
At energies below 200 keV, the spectrum is well described by the standard model [17] of thermal Comptonization
plus reﬂection, but at higher energies a large excess (∼ 18 s.d.) appears above its high-energy tail (see Fig. 1).
To further quantify this excess, we added a model spectrum of electron-positron plasma with temperature T (see
Methods section Spectral ﬁtting, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1); the temperature serves as a
measure of the annihilation line width.

The characteristic curved spectral shape of pair annihilation emission describes the excess in all three epochs
well. Its inclusion leads to a 5-s.d. overall improvement of the ﬁt compared to a model describing the excess with

Comptonization model (grey dashed curve) ﬁts the data up to ∼ 200 keV; it declines exponentially at higher
energies and falls short of the observed ﬂux. Our conservative, modiﬁed continuum model follows a power law

a power law (see Extended Data Tables 2, 3, 4 for details, including model alternatives). No shift with respect
to the laboratory frame of the annihilation line is required to ﬁt the data in epochs 1 and 2. A redshift of ∼10%
is required in epoch 3. The line width varies strongly between the three epochsthe temperature parameter varies
from a few keV to about 200 keV.

Electron-positron pair production is expected near luminous accreting black holes when their radiation spectra
extend above E = mec2 = 511 keV [18, 19], where me is the mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light. Pairs
are produced in collisions between MeV γ-rays, with an average cross-section σγγ ≈ 10−25 cm2. This process is
eﬃcient because of the small size of the source, radius r ≈ (3− 10)rg, where rg ≈ 10 km is the gravitational radius
of the black hole. During the V404 Cygni ﬂares, the observed luminosity in photons of energy E ≈ mec2 increases
up to L1 ≈ 1037 erg s−1, which corresponds to a photon density n1 ≈ L1/(πr2mec3), and an optical depth for
collisions between soft γ-rays of τγγ ≈ n1σγγr. Gamma-rays of higher energies are absorbed more eﬃciently as they
can interact with the more numerous X-rays of lower energies. The large optical depth τγγ ≈ 1 tends to suppress
the spectrum of the central compact source at photon energies E (cid:29) mec2, consistent with the upper limit on the
GeV emission (obtained from analysing public Fermi/LAT data, FGeV < 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1; see Methods
section FERMI/LAT data analysis). Thus, a signiﬁcant fraction of the luminosity is converted to pair plasma:
the plasma is continually created and annihilated inside the source, forming a broad annihilation line of width
equivalent to kT ≈ 100 keV [19]. Photon collisions outside the source create a pair outﬂow [20]. Pairs annihilating
outside the source are in Compton equilibrium with radiation at a temperature of a few tens of keV. Pair outﬂows
have also been invoked to explain the shape of the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes, in particular their ﬂat
slopes and the reduced reﬂection component [21, 22].

These expectations are conﬁrmed by our observations of a broad annihilation feature in epochs 1 and 2. The
˙N± ≈ 1042 s−1, and to an energy generation rate in the form
observed ﬂux corresponds to a positron creation rate of
of pairs, L±, of L± ≈ ˙N±mec2 ≈ 1036 erg s−1, a few per cent of the source luminosity [13], in agreement with models
[20]. Pair plasma annihilating outside the source is then consistent with observations in epoch 1 (kT ≈ 30 keV),
while annihilation inside the source corresponds to the broad line observed in epoch 2 (kT ≈ 170 keV).

diﬀerent annihilation models. Data are shown blue in both panels (error bars, 1 s.d.). In both panels, the black
dashed curve shows the Comptonization continuum, and the black solid line, the total model spectrum. a, Two
components of annihilation in ﬂight in a thermal plasma: kT ≈ 4 keV redshifted by 10% (red dashed curve), and
kT ≈ 500 keV (red dotted curve). b, Positronium three-photon annihilation redshifted by 10% (red dashed curve)
and annihilation in ﬂight in a hot plasma (red dotted curve).

In epoch 3, there is a hint of a steep decline on the blue side of the line that is characteristic of three-photon
annihilation of positronium atoms (see Methods section Spectral ﬁtting). Figure 2 shows the data ﬁtted by a
redshifted, narrow annihilation feature (Fig. 2a), or alternatively by a positronium-annihilation spectral shape
(Fig. 2b). In addition, the broad component extending above 511 keV may be ﬁtted by a very hot annihilation
line; this more complex model would correspond to two annihilation regions, cold and hot (see Extended Data
Table 5).
The smaller width of the line in epoch 3 (kT ≈ 2 − 3 keV), in combination with the detected redshift, poses a
challenge to models. The 10% redshift is consistent with a gravitational redshift of the source at radius r ≈ 10rg.
A line emitted in this region is expected to be signiﬁcantly broader, owing to the mildly relativistic bulk motions
of the plasma and dispersion in gravitational redshift.
The positronium interpretation also poses problems, because it requires [23] a dense plasma with a low
temperature, T < 106 K. The minimum temperature of a source with luminosity L ≈ 1038 erg s−1 and size
r ≈ 10rg ≈ 100 km is its eﬀective blackbody temperature, Tef f ≈ [L/(4πr2σbb)]1/4 ≈ 107 K, where σbb is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The accretion ﬂow at larger distances may contain much cooler gas, especially if the
central radiation is beamed and shielded by the inner accretion disk. Then the pair plasma created in the cen-
tral source may be blown out by radiation along the magnetic ﬁeld lines towards the colder gas, decelerate there
and form positronium before annihilating. This scenario is, however, inconsistent with the redshift of the line, in
particular when interpreted as a gravitational redshift.
The morphology of the material near the black hole may also be inferred from soft X-ray observations at high
spectral resolution [24], suggesting high ionization out to r ≈ 2 × 106 km. This is a plausible value for the outer
edge of the accretion disk. Variability of X-ray line strengths and a changing ionization strongly suggest that most
of the X-rays are not received directly but are observed after reﬂection/reprocessing in the outer region. This is
consistent with the ﬂat shape of the hard X-ray continuum [25] up to 100 keV. In this picture, the outer edge of
the disk is elevated, blocking our direct view towards the inner disk, and the X-ray continuum variability could be
due to changes in the outer disk, rather than to rapid changes in the accretion rate onto the black hole.

The ﬂux evolution of the continuum and annihilation features throughout our observation period is shown in
Fig. 3. The two components appear to be correlated. When the X-ray ﬂaring of V404 Cygni faded, the annihilation
signal also vanished. However, some annihilation radiation appeared between the X-ray ﬂares. Our time resolution
is much longer than the dynamical timescale of the inner accretion disk (milliseconds), the jet ejection timescale [2]
(minutes), the light travel time between the two binary components (80 s), and the timescale of adiabatic expansion
of ejected blobs [3] (minutes, less than 1 h). Thus, our measurements probe time-averaged values and do not resolve
the rise time of the annihilation ﬂux, which may be much shorter than our 6-h bins (see Methods section Timing

from V404 Cygni are shown as they evolve during the June 2015 ﬂaring period, measured between 17 June and 30
June. INTEGRAL orbits 1554-1558 and epochs 1-3 are shown at the top. The black histogram shows the spectral

analysis). Our search for a lag between the X-ray ﬂares and the annihilation radiation was inconclusive, although
there is an indication of a lag of several hours (see Methods section Timing analysis).
In contrast to hadronic gas, pair plasma is easily accelerated and immediately attains an equilibrium bulk speed
v ≈ c/2 away from the source (governed by the local radiation ﬁeld anisotropy), forming the base of a relativistic
outﬂow from the accretion disk [20]. The 67◦ inclination implies a Doppler blueshift of ∼10%, comparable to the
gravitational redshift at r ≈ 10rg. From our data in epochs 1 and 2, we can neither conﬁrm nor exclude possible
residual shifts of the broad line. Annihilation radiation around the source can be strongly aﬀected by the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration, which can change the outﬂow speed and direction. The power deposited in the pair plasma
alone of L± ≈ 1036 erg s−1 would be suﬃcient to explain the observed typical radio luminosity associated with
escaping blobs on larger scales [26]. A changing magnetic ﬁeld may be responsible for the evolution of the line
shape between epochs 1 and 2.

The outﬂow of pairs from the central source makes microquasars eﬃcient factories, enriching the surrounding
medium with positrons. This can help to solve the puzzle of annihilation radiation observed from the bulge region
of our Galaxy [11]. In a steady state, the annihilation rate in the inner Galaxy is (1 − 2) × 1043 positrons s−1 and
must be balanced by a positron supply with the same rate. During the 10-day ﬂaring period, V404 Cygni produced
∼ 1042 positrons s−1. In more luminous microquasars such as GRS 1915+105, this number is expected to be even
larger. Thus, the steady-state annihilation rate in the inner Galaxy requires only about ten such sources to be
active at any time. With duty cycles (that is, ﬂaring versus quiescent epochs) of the order of 10−3, as observed for
V404 Cygni, ∼ 103− 104 accreting black hole binaries of this type would be required in the inner Galaxy, consistent
with population synthesis estimates [27].
The excess emission at a few hundred keV to a few MeV that we observed in the ﬂaring epochs of V404
Cygni may also be responsible for the excess (about 10 keV photons cm−2 s−1 at 1 MeV [28]) found in the diﬀuse
γ-ray continuum spectrum of our Galaxys ridge [29]. This excess is not accounted for by models of cosmic-ray
interactions with interstellar gas [28], nor by inverse-Compton emission, and had been attributed to an unknown
source population. A few active sources at an average observed microquasar distance of 5 kpc [26] would be needed
to explain the diﬀuse MeV excess. The implied duty cycle is consistent with the above estimate for ∼ 104 sources.
Thus, the same population of microquasars could also be the origin of the observed inner Galaxys excess in MeV
continuum.

A Methods: SPI data extraction

INTEGRALs [12] SPI γ-ray spectrometer[30, 31] provides photon event measurements, where pulse heights are
recorded in a 19-element germanium semiconductor detector array. A coded mask imprints a shadowgram of
celestial sources onto the detector array, as particular regions of the sky are blocked from detectors through the
opaque tungsten elements of the mask. Re-orientations of the telescope by small angles (dithering, ∼ 2◦) provide
an additional coding pattern. Coded-mask imaging allows sources within the telescope ﬁeld of view of ∼ 30◦ to be
resolved with a precision of ∼ 2◦.

We accumulate event data for each telescope pointing and detector and bin them into spectra, after initial
preprocessing with INTEGRAL standard OSA 9 software. We use single-detector hits only, to ensure a well-known
spectral detector response. Above 530 keV, we use pulse-shape ﬁltered events to suppress an electronics malfunction
that contaminates normal event data [32], and we apply their appropriate ﬁlter eﬃciency factor of 0.8. Pointings
typically lasted one hour during the observations of V404 Cygni.

For adequate spectral precision, we accumulate three-day orbit data to extract a spectrum for V404 Cygni.
The full set of detector spectra over an orbit is then ﬁtted with parametrised models for instrumental background
and for all candidate sources in the ﬁeld of view [33]. The celestial emission models are folded into the data space
of spectra using the coded mask shadowing properties, and the energy response of the detectors. Thus, intensity
scaling factors per energy bin are obtained for all candidate sources within the telescope ﬁeld of view, which are
V404 Cyg, Cyg X-1, Cyg X-3, Cyg A, 3A1954+319 and EXO2030+375. Our model ﬁt of background and sky
contributions to data then provides spectra for all these sources.

The background is derived from data of the two preceding INTEGRAL orbits (1552, 1553). Being from the
pre-ﬂaring periods of V404 Cygni and being pointed to regions devoid of sources at high Galactic latitudes, these
data are free of any high-energy (> 300 keV) signals from the sky. The background is modelled as a constant
detector-intensity ratio (pattern) per energy bin, taken from these independent data. Owing to the strong time
variability, the overall amplitudes per energy bin (background-intensity scaling factors) have been determined on
a one-hour timescale.
The continuum sensitivity (3 s.d.) [31] around 400 keV for an exposure of two days (corresponding to the dead-
time corrected on-time of one orbit) is about 3.0 × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 keV−1 with only a weak dependence
towards higher energies (about 1.8 × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 keV−1 at 1600 keV). This is suﬃcient to detect
sources with intensities of ∼ 100 mCrab above 400 keV. V404 Cygni, for example, shows an average intensity of
(12.5±3.5)×10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 keV−1 around 500 keV, and about (2.5±1.6)×10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 keV−11
around 1000 keV, during its ﬂaring epochs (see Fig. 1), in accordance with sensitivity limits. Thus, at higher
energies, statistical uncertainties dominate over systematics.

Some cross-talk among the sources is expected to occur in the data of a coded-mask instrument with a large ﬁeld-
of-view. Also, concerns about artefacts from background model inadequacies need special attention. We therefore
compare the spectra of a set of hypothetical sources ﬁtted additionally in the empty regions of the ﬁeld-of-view,
together with the above-mentioned known sources, as commonalities or anti-correlations among them would be a
hint of background or cross-talk issues. For a given data set, the total number of measured photons is ﬁxed, so
that the inclusion of test sources may result in an increased ﬂux value for one source while at the same time reduce
the ﬂux for another (anti-correlations). But apart from clear signals in the spectra of the real sources, all source
spectra in the empty ﬁeld regions are fully consistent with background only, and in particular do not show any
spectral signatures beyond statistical ﬂuctuations.

B Methods: Spectral ﬁtting

The spectra for the three ﬂaring epochs were ﬁtted as a sum of two components: a Comptonized continuum C(E)
and pair annihilation emission P (E)

f (E) = C(E) + P (E)

(1)

Continuum X-ray spectra of accreting black holes in the hard state are well explained by the thermal Comp-
tonization model [17, 34]: seed low-energy photons (for example, thermal radiation from the optically thick accretion
disk) are re-processed by a hot plasma corona through Compton scattering to higher energies, leading to a power-
law spectrum. The power law cuts oﬀ exponentially where the photon energy exceeds the mean energy of the
scattering electrons, which is typically ∼ 50 − 100 keV [17, 34]. This model describes the spectra of V404 Cygni
reasonably well below ∼ 200 keV, between and during ﬂaring [13]. However, additional emission is required above
200 keV. One can model this emission as an additional power-law component due to scattering by non-thermal,
accelerated particles. We use the following approximation to the Comptonization spectrum

for the temperature and energy regions of interest [35] which are accurate to 0.04% across the range presented in
this analysis.

The TPA model (P (E), equation (4)), shown in Extended Data Fig. 1, does not include possible Doppler shifts
due to the bulk motion of the pair plasma or the gravitational redshift, which may be signiﬁcant when the emission
originates near the black hole.

The ﬁtted parameters in our composite model, f (E), are the normalization of continuum at 100 keV, that is,
the amplitude A0, the low-energy power-law index α, the cutoﬀ energy EC, the e-folding energy EF , the high-
energy power-law index β, the extrapolation energy EX , the amplitude of the annihilation feature n+n−c, and the
temperature of the pair plasma TT P A. The parameters E0 and B0 do not inﬂuence the ﬁt and are only introduced
for convenience and clear arrangement.

From these parameters, we calculate the following derived parameters. IT P A is the diﬀerential ﬂux integrated

over the energy

Fitted and derived parameters for all epoch can be found in Extended Data Tables 1, 3, and 5.

The ﬁt quality obtained for our one-orbit spectra is not satisfactory at ﬁrst glance, with χ2 values of 63.7,
69.2 and 280.9 for 38 (37) d.o.f. (degrees of freedom) (see Extended Data Table 2). Typically, an observation is
dominated by a large instrumental background. But below ∼ 200 keV, the number of photons detected from V404
Cygni is very high, (about ﬁve times stronger than the background), thus systematics of the instrument response
limit the accuracy of the ﬁt. At energies above ∼ 150 keV, our composite model obtains a satisfactory ﬁt quality
with χ2 values of 13.0 to 14.5 for 14 d.o.f. Overall, we detect a large high-energy excess above the conventional
Comptonized cut-oﬀ description, with a total signiﬁcance of ∼ 18 s.d., consistent with high-energy excesses reported
in other studies [13, 25, 36]. Our more conservative analysis uses a phenomenological model of the continuum that
avoids the high-energy cut-oﬀ of the Comptonization model by modifying it to a power-law extension towards high
energies. When we use this modiﬁed Comptonization description, and add a model spectrum of electron-positron
plasma of a temperature T , we ﬁnd a signiﬁcance of 5 s.d. altogether (see Extended Data Table 4) for the pair
annihilation component above the Comptonization component. Signiﬁcances have been estimated by χ2 goodness-
of-ﬁt tests, in which extra model components are zeroed in order to evaluate the improvement in χ2, compared
to the simpler model with fewer parameters. The test statistics therefore follow a χ2-distribution with 1 d.o.f., in
which data are properly scaled by their statistical uncertainties which account for Poissonian ﬂuctuations of source
and background.

The ﬁt shown in Fig. 2b assumes a diﬀerent annihilation model, more typical when positrons are slowed down
by, for example, Coulomb interactions before annihilating [37]. This has been well measured in our Galaxy [11], and
in terrestrial laboratory experiments [38]. When positrons annihilate at thermal energies, the spectra of positron
annihilation show the intermediate formation of a positronium atom, consisting of a positron and an electron.
This process is very eﬃcient at low energies and in particular below a threshold energy of 6.8 eV (equivalent to

8

temperatures below 7.8× 104 K). Positron annihilation then can occur from a singlet state of positronium with two
photons at 511 keV (para-positronium), or a triplet state with a three photon annihilation continuum spectrum
[37] rising in intensity up to a maximum at 511 keV (ortho-positronium).

We deﬁne the ﬁtted parameters of the additional components as follows. Ecentroid is the Doppler-shifted peak
position of the low-energy annihilation feature, that is, pair plasma annihilation in Fig. 2a, and the sharp edge
of the ortho-positronium shape, O(E), in Fig. 2b. The plasma temperature kTT P A is only given for cases in
which a thermal pair annihilation model has been ﬁtted to the data. In both cases, the additional components are
scaled/normalized by a ﬁtted amplitude O0.

We derive the ﬂux, F511, of the second features by integrating the diﬀerential spectral shape over the energy.

For Fig. 2a, see equation (5), for the ortho-positronium feature, the ﬂux is given by

C Methods: Timing analysis

For the timing analysis of the annihilation emission, we only ﬁt the amplitudes of our model components, A0 of the
continuum, and n+n−c of the annihilation feature (see equations (2) and (4) and Fig. 3), in hourly time bins, while
holding the spectral shape, that is, all other parameters in both continuum and annihilation model, ﬁxed. This
assumes a constant thermal pair annihilation temperature TT P A during one epoch and sums all emission which is
spectroscopically identiﬁed as due to positron annihilation. The rise time of the excess ﬂux is estimated as a factor
of two increase in the positron annihilation component ﬂux. This is diﬃcult to estimate, as it is limited by photon
statistics; we estimate a ﬂux doubling within ∼ 2 h. This interprets all ﬁtted signatures on top of the continuum,
C(E), as pair plasma emission, rather than accelerated particle emission represented by a power law. In particular,
above 500 keV, this may incur a bias towards high annihilation ﬂux values, compared to the detailed spectroscopic
analysis per epoch.

The time evolution of the hard X-ray continuum emission (100-200 keV) is obtained [13] from ﬁtting in one-hour
intervals the coded-mask response to all sources in the ﬁeld together with the background model, adjusting the
background normalization coeﬃcient per hour.
Cygni during MJD 57191 and 57203 in hourly time bins is 0.45 for zero lag, and 0.34 for a lag of ∼ 15 h.

We have analysed the all-sky survey data of the FERMI/LAT instrument taken during the 15.5-h time window
when we see the largest positron ﬂare, in epoch 3 at orbit 1557, corresponding to MJD 57199.616 to 57200.261. The
Pass8 data of a 20◦ circle around V404 Cygni in the energy range 100 MeV to 10 GeV have been retrieved from the
Fermi Science Support Center (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ssc/LAT/LATDataQuery.cgi; accessed 6
August 2015). We employed the unbinned likelihood analysis as implemented in the user-contributed LATAnaly-
sisScripts (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/LATAnalysisScripts.html; accessed
6 August 2015) provided by FSSC, after changing to Pass8 details. Standard event cleaning/removal was applied
(http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone_Data_Exploration
/Data_preparation.html; accessed 6 August 2015). We used the gll_iem_v06.fits Galactic interstellar emis-
sion model, and the iso_P8R2_SOURCE_V6_v06.txt isotropic spectral template for the SOURCE event class
(front+back). The Cygnus Loop, Cygnus Cocoon, γ Cyg and HB 21 have been included in the ﬁtting, as
well as bright 3FGL sources. No source is detected at the position of V404 Cygni. We derive upper limits of
8 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1 in the 100 MeV to 1 GeV band, and 3 × 10−9 cm−2 s−1 in the 1-10 GeV band.
