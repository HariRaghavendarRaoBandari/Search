In this letter, we show that the newly detected H.E.S.S. γ-ray diffuse emission from the Galactic center below
0.45 deg can be accounted for by inverse Compton emission from millisecond pulsars and heavy (∼ 100 TeV)
dark matter annihilating to electrons or muons with a thermal or sub-thermal cross-section, provided that the
dark matter density proﬁle features a supermassive black hole-induced spike on sub-pc scales. We discuss
the impact of the interstellar radiation ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld and diffusion set-up on the spectral and spatial
morphology of the resulting emission. For well-motivated parameters, we show that the DM-induced emission
reproduces the spatial morphology of the H.E.S.S. signal above ∼ 10 TeV, while we obtain a more extended
component from pulsars at lower energies, which could be used as a prediction for future H.E.S.S. observations.

INTRODUCTION

The H.E.S.S. collaboration has released the most detailed
high-energy γ-ray view to date of the inner 300 pc of the
Galactic center (GC) region, thanks to improved statistics ac-
cumulated from 10 years of observation of the GC. In addi-
tion to the previously observed Galactic ridge emission [1], a
spherically symmetric diffuse emission has been detected be-
tween ∼ 200 GeV and 50 TeV [2]. Speciﬁcally, this emission
has been extracted in an open ring centered on the GC, with
azimuthal size 294 deg, and inner and outer radii 0.15 and
0.45 deg, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [2]. This
corresponds to a solid angle of 1.4× 10−4 sr. We refer to this
new feature as the H.E.S.S. diffuse emission, which is distinct
from the central source HESS J1745-290, which has a size of
0.1 deg.

In the standard scenario, TeV γ-rays originate from the de-
cay of neutral pions produced by collisions of protons accel-
erated by the central black hole (BH) Sgr A* with ambient
gas.
In this work, we explore a possible link between the
H.E.S.S. diffuse emission and the excess of GeV γ-rays over
diffuse backgrounds at the GC, reported in the data of the
Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) by several independent
groups (see e.g. [3, 4]). The Fermi excess may originate from
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), as pointed out in Refs. [5–12],
and reinforced by several more recent papers [13–15]. Ac-
tually, TeV emission from inverse Compton radiation of e±
produced by the same MSP population, and accelerated in the
pulsar wind may signiﬁcantly contribute to the H.E.S.S. dif-
fuse emission.

A multi-TeV DM candidate would also produce γ-rays in
the energy range of interest. However, as discussed in the fol-

lowing, the DM density proﬁle must be strongly contracted in
the very inner region in order for the associated ﬂux to con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the H.E.S.S. emission. A supermassive
BH-induced density spike [16] would provide the required en-
hancement of the annihilation signal.

In this letter, we show that a combination of MSPs and a
spike of heavy DM can explain the H.E.S.S. diffuse emission.1

TEV GAMMA-RAYS FROM PULSARS AND DM

ANNIHILATIONS

IC emission from MSPs

The rotation energy of MSPs has been shown to power a
high-energy e± wind [17]. The interaction of this pulsar wind
with the interstellar medium may create a shock which can
accelerate e± to very high energies [18, 19]. Their maximum
energy Emax is limited by escape from the shock region and
synchrotron losses, and can be as high as a few tens of TeV
[18]. The resulting e± injection spectrum follows a power law,
with the maximum energy accounted for by an exponential
inj exp(−Einj/Emax), where
cut-off [18]: dNe/dEinj
we take Emax = 50 TeV as in Ref. [18]. The normalization
is worked out by ﬁtting the spectrum of the H.E.S.S. diffuse
emission.

(cid:12)(cid:12)MSP ∝ E−2

1 In the region of the H.E.S.S. diffuse signal lies the massive molecular cloud
Sgr C [2]. A γ-ray contamination to the diffuse signal, from a source lo-
cated in this cloud, cannot be excluded. Our model of the overall diffuse
signal in terms of a combination of MSPs and heavy DM should therefore
be interpreted as an upper limit.

These e± emit γ-rays by upscattering photons of the inter-
stellar radiation ﬁeld (ISRF) via the inverse Compton (IC) pro-
cess. The resulting γ-ray spectrum can extend to very high
energies, up to the range of interest for H.E.S.S. observations.
This led the authors of Refs. [18, 19] to claim that IC emis-
sion from MSPs could be responsible for the H.E.S.S. central
source data, based on a spectral analysis. In principle, e± also
emit bremsstrahlung by interacting with nuclei of the ambient
gas, but this component is negligible with respect to IC over
the energy range of interest.

The resulting IC ﬂux is obtained by integrating the emissiv-
ity jMSP over the line of sight (l.o.s.) coordinate s and the ﬁeld
of view (fov) ∆Ω [20]:

where bG((cid:126)x,E) is the sum of the synchrotron and IC loss
rates, corresponding to the GALPROP losses tabulated in
Ref. [24]. The halo function ˜I(cid:126)x,MSP models the effect of spa-
tial diffusion on the MSP proﬁle, and is computed exactly
as in Refs. [20, 25], assuming a diffusion set-up correspond-
ing to the usual MED parametrization: a diffusion coefﬁ-
cient K(E) = K0 (E/E0)δ, with K0 = 3.38 × 1027 cm2 s−1,
E0 = 1 GeV, δ = 0.7, and a half height of L = 4 kpc for the
diffusion zone.3 For the density that enters into the calculation
of ˜I(cid:126)x,MSP, we use the same generalized Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) proﬁle with slope ∼ 1.2, consistent with the morphol-
ogy of the GeV excess, as in Ref. [20].

Annihilation signal from a DM spike

Following the prescription of Ref. [16], we assume that a
supermassive BH-induced spike—i.e. a strong enhancement

one used in Ref. [2].

of the density—is present in the inner part of the DM density
proﬁles. More speciﬁcally, a spike is predicted to arise around
a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growing adiabatically at
the center of a DM halo, and typically corresponds to a den-
sity going as r−γsp, with γsp = 7/3, below a parsec-scale radius
Rsp. We normalize the DM proﬁle exactly as in Ref. [25]. The
existence of a spike is actually debated, as discussed e.g. in
Refs. [26, 27]. In particular, stellar heating of DM particles
may lead to a smoother proﬁle with slope 3/2 instead, and a
spike may be destroyed by BH mergers. Nevertheless, ded-
icated numerical simulations and observations are needed to
settle the question.

annihilation cross-section into channel f and dNγ, f /dEγ the γ-
ray spectrum from this ﬁnal state, taken from Ref. [21]. In
practice, the DM proﬁle is so steep that the integral depends
weakly on the precise value of the fov ∆Ωc, which we take
equal to 10−5 sr, the size of the central source HESS J1745-
290.

IC emission from DM annihilation

Prompt emission from a DM spike is the dominant source
of DM-induced γ-rays in the central parsec, but the corre-
sponding spatial extension is too small to account for the
H.E.S.S. diffuse emission detected up to 0.45 deg. How-
ever, for leptonic annihilation channels we expect a signiﬁcant
amount of γ-rays to arise from IC emission from e± produced
in DM annihilations. Since e± undergo spatial diffusion, the
resulting γ-ray emission can be signiﬁcantly more spatially ex-
tended than the initial DM proﬁle.
Considering that with our DM spike model, e± are pro-
duced by DM annihilations below parsec scales, we no longer
use the GALPROP ISRF in this case, but the one computed in
Ref. [29] and referred to as the Kistler ISRF. This enhanced
radiation ﬁeld accounts for the strong sources of photons in
the central parsec of the Galaxy, and is about three orders of
magnitude larger than the GALPROP ISRF. We also account
for absorption of γ-rays from e+e− pair production on ISRF
photons, using the attenuation factor computed in Ref. [29].
Absorption is essentially relevant above 10 TeV, and leads to

stands for the Kistler ISRF. We assume a B = 0.1 mG mag-
netic ﬁeld in the central pc, following Refs. [29–31]. The IC
energy loss rate bIC,K is computed following the procedure of
Ref. [23], which models the ISRF as a superposition of grey-
body spectra. Considering the freedom we have on the poorly
constrained diffusion set-up below ∼ 100 pc, we again use
the benchmark MED set-up to compute the spike halo func-
tion ˜I(cid:126)x,DM. The electron injection spectrum dNe, f /dEinj
is taken from Ref. [21] and includes electroweak corrections,
relevant at high energies. ˜I(cid:126)x,DM is computed using the method
described in Ref. [25], which accounts for the steepness of the
source term in the cosmic-ray equation due to the DM spike.

region (right panel, dotted line). We consider a DM candidate
of mass mDM = 100 TeV, annihilating to e+e− with the canon-
ical cross-section of (cid:104)σv(cid:105) = 3× 10−26 cm3 s−1.4

The left panel of Fig. 1 shows that the H.E.S.S. diffuse
emission can be accounted for by the sum of IC emission
from MSPs and a DM spike, with the lower part of the
H.E.S.S. spectrum associated with MSPs, and the high energy
part above ∼ 10 TeV with DM. The reduced chi-squared is
χ2/d.o.f. = 23.7/20 ≈ 1.19, showing the quality of the ﬁt.5
As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our model is compatible
with the data from the central source, in particular with the
upper limits at the highest energies.
For an annihilation cross-section of 3× 10−26 cm3 s−1, we
ﬁnd that the spike radius Rsp must not be larger than ∼ 0.1 pc,
otherwise the associated IC ﬂux signiﬁcantly overshoots both
the diffuse and point source data. There is actually a degen-
eracy between the cross-section and the spike radius, but this
is beyond the scope of this letter.6 For completeness we com-
puted the IC ﬂux from a heated spike with a 1.5 slope, but
the result is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the
H.E.S.S. ﬂux. A SMBH-induced spike is therefore required
for DM annihilations to account for the H.E.S.S. diffuse emis-
sion.
We obtain similar results for DM annihilation into µ+µ−,
with a slightly softer DM-induced IC spectrum, as shown in
Fig. 2. We disregard softer channels like τ+τ− or b¯b, for
which the IC ﬂux is too small in the H.E.S.S. extended region
of interest while the associated prompt emission overshoots
the central source data.

Spatial morphology

Shown in Fig. 3 are the IC intensities E2

γ dn/(dEγdΩ) at
0.5 TeV (thin blue lines) and 23 TeV (thick black lines), as
a function of angle θ (or radius r) from the center, for the
same components (MSPs, dashed, and DM spike, dot-dashed)
as in Fig. 1. For the DM spike, the IC intensity drops steeply
around 0.3 deg at 23 TeV and around 1 deg at 0.5 TeV. These
speciﬁc scales correspond to the diffusion lengths associated
with the losses and diffusion coefﬁcient,7 and turn out to be
very similar to the characteristic size of the H.E.S.S. diffuse
emission. For the MSP model, the spatial extension of the IC
emission is of order a few degrees, therefore larger than the
H.E.S.S. region.

4 Models like minimal DM predict DM masses up to a few tens of TeV (see
e.g. Ref. [32]), but it is possible to go beyond the weak scale, up to very
large masses, if for instance DM is part of a decoupled sector [33].

5 We have 22 data points and 2 free parameters, namely the normalization of

the MSP ﬂux and the size of the spike, so 20 degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).

6 In particular, the value of the cross-section considered here reaches the
unitarity limit at 100 TeV [34]. However, the cross-section needed for a
larger spike radius would be smaller.
7 For injection at ∼ 100 TeV and propagation down to 23 TeV, the diffusion
length is ∼ 50 pc or equivalently ∼ 0.3 deg.

The diffuse emission has been detected by H.E.S.S. by
accumulating statistics from a signiﬁcant exposure time in
this region. However, the emission might be even more ex-
tended, and future H.E.S.S. observations at Galactic latitudes
|b| > 1 deg would greatly help to discriminate between the
proposed scenarios.
In particular, according to our predic-
tions, H.E.S.S. should observe an even more extended signal
below ∼ 10 TeV.

FIG. 3. Intensity of IC emission from MSPs (dashed) and a 0.1 pc
DM spike (dot-dashed) as a function of angular distance from the
GC, at 0.5 TeV (thin blue lines) and 23 TeV (thick black lines).
The data points at these energies and their error bars are depicted
as shaded rectangles.

The IC ﬂux from the DM spike is sensitive to the losses
and diffusion coefﬁcient in the central pc. On the one hand,
a magnetic ﬁeld in the mG range—larger than the 0.1 mG
value we have considered—in the central pc, as suggested
in Ref. [35], would lead to a factor ∼ 100 increase in syn-
chrotron losses, thus signiﬁcantly reducing the IC ﬂux and
spoiling the achievement of explaining the high-energy part
of the H.E.S.S. diffuse emission. On the other hand, changing
the diffusion coefﬁcient from the MED to the MIN or MAX
set-ups [25]—which usually quantify the uncertainty on diffu-
sion on large scales—only changes the ﬂux by a factor ∼ 1.5,
which does not affect our conclusions. However, if the diffu-
sion coefﬁcient was in fact much smaller, typically for Bohm
diffusion [18], the spike-induced IC emission would be con-
ﬁned within the region corresponding to the central source and
there would be no leakage into the diffuse emission region.

SYNCHROTRON EMISSION AND X-RAY DATA

Steady diffuse X-ray emission was recently detected with
the NuSTAR satellite within a few pc of Sgr A*, in the
20-40 keV band [36, 37]. Considering that for e± injected
by ∼ 100 TeV DM, the typical synchrotron energy Esyn ∼
66 (Ee/100 TeV)2 (B/0.1 mG) keV falls in the hard X-ray do-

the H.E.S.S. diffuse emission does not overshoot the NuSTAR
data by producing too much synchrotron radiation.
Within 40 arcsec of Sgr A*, the ﬂux measured by NuSTAR
in the 20-40 keV band is ∼ 2× 10−12 erg cm2 s−1 [36, 37].
In the same region, at 40 keV, and for B = 0.1 mG, we ﬁnd
a synchrotron ﬂux of ∼ 7× 10−14 erg cm2 s−1 for the e+e−
annihilation channel. This is about 30 times smaller than the
measured ﬂux. The MSP component does not give a sizable
contribution to the hard X-ray ﬂux, due to a softer injection
spectrum. Therefore our model of the H.E.S.S. diffuse emis-
sion is compatible with NuSTAR observations.

Interestingly, for a larger magnetic ﬁeld, typically 5 mG, the
synchrotron ﬂux from the DM spike is of the order of the NuS-
TAR ﬂux. In addition, the corresponding synchrotron losses
reduce the diffusion length—and thus the size of the emission
region—to a few pc, similar to the NuSTAR region. As a re-
sult, if the magnetic ﬁeld is in the mG range, the DM spike no
longer accounts for the H.E.S.S. diffuse emission, but may in-
stead contribute signiﬁcantly to the hard X-ray emission mea-
sured with NuSTAR within a few pc of Sgr A*, although it is
unlikely to account for the entire signal considering the asym-
metry of the NuSTAR emission.

CONCLUSION

In this letter, we have shown that the sum of IC emission
from e± produced by the same population of MSPs that can
explain the Fermi GeV excess, and by annihilations of heavy
(∼ 100 TeV) DM particles in a SMBH-induced density spike,
can account for the new diffuse emission observed at the GC
with H.E.S.S.. Our model reproduces very well the spectrum
of the emission, with MSPs accounting for observations below
∼ 10 TeV and DM accounting for the higher energy part of
the spectrum. We have also discussed the associated spatial
morphology. We ﬁnd that the DM-induced emission has the
same extension as the observed signal, while the size of the
MSP component is larger, reaching up to a few degrees. This
can be used to test this scenario, depending on whether the
current extension is the actual size of the emission region, or
if more statistics will uncover a more extended signal.
