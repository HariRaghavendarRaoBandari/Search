TRIGGERING AND DELIVERY ALGORITHMS FOR AGN FEEDBACK

GREGORY R. MEECE1,2, G. MARK VOIT1, BRIAN W. O’SHEA1,3,4,5

Draft version March 14, 2016

ABSTRACT

We compare several common sub-grid implementations of AGN feedback, focusing on the effects of different
triggering mechanisms and the differences between thermal and kinetic feedback. Our main result is that pure
thermal feedback that is centrally injected behaves differently from feedback with even a small kinetic com-
ponent. Speciﬁcally, pure thermal feedback results in excessive condensation and smothering of the AGN by
cold gas because the feedback energy does not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences
between implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the spatial resolution is sufﬁciently
high, probably because all of the implementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar con-
ditions. In order to assess the role of resolution, we vary the size of the “accretion zone” in which properties are
measured to determine the AGN accretion rate and resulting feedback power. We ﬁnd that a larger accretion
zone results in steadier jets but can also allow too much cold-gas condensation in simulations with a Bondi-like
triggering algorithm. We also vary the opening angle of jet precession and ﬁnd that a larger precession angle
causes more of the jet energy to thermalize closer to the AGN, thereby producing results similar to pure thermal
feedback. Our simulations conﬁrm that AGN can regulate the thermal state of cool-core galaxy clusters and
maintain the core in a state that is marginally susceptable to thermal instability and precipitation.

1. INTRODUCTION

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is thought to be present
in the core of nearly every massive galaxy and galaxy clus-
ter. Based on estimates of jet power from AGN-inﬂated cav-
ities, it has become clear that an AGN can strongly inﬂu-
ence cooling and condensation of gas in its host galaxy (e.g.,
McNamara & Nulsen 2012), potentially explaining the rela-
tionships observed between the mass of a galaxy’s central
black hole and the velocity dispersion of its stars (e.g., Merritt
2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000), as well as the star-formation
properties of galaxies with AGNs (e.g., Kauffmann et al.
2003). Directly simulating the co-evolution of AGNs together
with their host galaxies is not computationally feasible due
to the large differences in mass and size between an AGN
and its host galaxy. Also, the diverse set of complex physical
processes that govern AGN accretion and outﬂow production
remain poorly understood. To circumvent these difﬁculties
in studies of galaxy evolution, simulators have developed a
number of “subgrid" implementations of AGN feedback that
are intended to capture the interplay between the AGN and
its environment without representing the details of AGN ac-
cretion on smaller scales (see, for example Omma et al. 2004;
Springel et al. 2005a; Puchwein et al. 2008; Booth & Schaye
2009; Gaspari et al. 2011b; Dubois et al. 2012; Li & Bryan
2014a; Steinborn et al. 2015). However, subgrid implemen-
tations of AGN feedback vary widely, and there has been lit-
tle systematic comparison (but see Wurster & Thacker 2013;
Yang et al. 2012). From the explorations of parameter space
carried out in these studies, it has become evident that vary-
ing certain AGN feedback parameters can lead to strong dif-

ferences in feedback power and energy propogation. In this
paper, we compare several of the popular methods for imple-
menting AGN feedback.

An AGN consists of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
surrounded by a disk of accreting material. Twisted magnetic
ﬁelds in the disk are thought to channel charged particles into
jets, which can draw additional power from the spin of the
SMBH via the Blandford-Znajek effect (Blandford & Znajek
1977; Blandford & Payne 1982). These relativistic jets pro-
duce synchrotron emission, which is observed in the ra-
dio band. Hence,
this mode of AGN energy output is
termed “radio-mode” feedback (e.g., Churazov et al. 2001;
Springel et al. 2005b). Additionally, differential rotation in
the accretion disk will heat the accreting material, producing
a strong UV ﬂux. If the SMBH is accreting near the Edding-
ton Limit, radiation pressure may also drive large outﬂows.
This “quasar-mode” feedback (e.g., Churazov et al. 2005) is
composed of non-relativistic material and is more isotropic
than radio-mode feedback.

The length and mass scales that are important for AGN
are much smaller than the range covered by galaxies and
galaxy clusters. For example, a black hole with a mass sim-
ilar to the one dwelling at the center of the Perseus Cluster
(∼ 3.4 × 108 M⊙; see Wilman et al. 2005) has a Schwarzchild
radius of only a few AU, whereas the virial radius of a galaxy
cluster is & 1 Mpc. Cosmological simulations capable of
modeling entire galaxy clusters typically have a maximum
resolution of ∼ 1 kpc, meaning that the AGN’s behavior must
be approximated with a subgrid model. Furthermore, AGN
are known to be variable on timescales much shorter than the
dynamical time of a galaxy. Cosmological simulations that
model structure formation over a Hubble Time must there-
fore rely on an AGN model that smooths out this short-term
variability while preserving the large-scale behavior of the re-
sulting feedback.

In order for a self-regulated feedback loop to arise, a sub-
grid AGN model must capture the coupling between an AGN
and its fuel supply. A triggering algorithm must somehow

2

estimate the mass accretion rate onto the SMBH, which trans-
lates into a proportional release of feedback energy. Then
a delivery algorithm must prescribe how that feedback en-
ergy interacts with the local environment. In cosmological
simulations, the subgrid AGN model must also include pre-
scriptions for following the creation, advection, and merger
of SMBHs, although these are not discussed in this work (see
Sijacki et al. 2007; Di Matteo et al. 2008; Wurster & Thacker
2013; Vogelsberger et al. 2013, for more discussion on these
topics). Instead, we are focusing on just the triggering and
delivery algorithms.

There are a number of reasons to believe that AGN feed-
back in massive galaxies is self-regulated. First, as stated ear-
lier, strong relationships have been found between the masses
of SMBHs and the properties of their host galaxies. Sec-
ond, AGNs are considered the best candidates for solving
the “Cooling Flow" problem in galaxy clusters and elliptical
galaxies (Binney & Tabor 1995; McNamara & Nulsen 2007;
Nulsen & McNamara 2013). Many galaxy clusters have cen-
tral cooling times that are far shorter than the age of the clus-
ters, but the observed star-formation rates are an order of mag-
nitude or more below what would be expected from uninhib-
ited cooling (O’Dea et al. 2008, 2010; McDonald et al. 2011).
Also, the amounts of cold gas that seem to be accumulating
are much less than one would naively expect (Peterson et al.
2003; Peterson & Fabian 2006). This tension implies the ex-
istence of a heat source that roughly balances cooling losses.
Non-AGN heat sources, such as supernovae, mergers, con-
duction, and preheating have been proposed, but are either not
powerful enough to balance cooling (e.g., Skory et al. 2013)
or are inconsistent with observations. AGNs, however, are
known to be present in the central galaxies of galaxy clus-
ters and produce feedback energy comparable to the cool-
ing rate. Binney & Tabor (1995) showed that when cooling-
triggered jets are added to models of cool-core clusters, al-
ternating periods cooling and jet heating can lead to a quasi-
steady state for the ICM in the cluster core. As discussed in
McNamara & Nulsen (2012), the jet power must be closely
coupled to the cooling rate if AGN are balancing cooling in
clusters. Otherwise, the AGN would either overheat or under-
heat the intra-cluster medium (ICM).

One simple algorithm for estimating the AGN accretion
rate bases the scaling properties on the Bondi-Hoyle accre-
tion model, set out in Bondi (1952), which implicitly assumes
that the SMBH is accreting hot ambient gas directly from the
ICM. Strictly speaking, such a Bondi accretion ﬂow should be
steady-state, spherically symmetric, and isentropic. Accre-
tion then becomes supersonic within the Bondi radius given
by RBondi ≈ 2GMBH/c2
s where MBH is the black hole mass and
cs is the sound speed of the gas near RBondi, and proceeds at a
rate ˙MBondi that depends on MBH and cs. However, the Bondi
radius is unresolved in many numerical simulations of AGN
feedback, as is its impact on galaxy evolution. Springel et al.
(2005a) therefore proposed a parameterized Bondi accretion
rate with an artiﬁcial boost factor α such that ˙MBH = α ˙MBondi.
The boost factor α is typically chosen to be large because the
actual gas properties at the Bondi radius are likely to permit a
greater accretion rate than would arise in under-resolved sim-
ulations. Springel et al. (2005a) and subsequent studies fol-
lowing up on that work use α = 100, while Khalatyan et al.
(2008) use α = 300. Hopkins & Hernquist (2006), in contrast,
use a factor that is near unity, albeit for studies of galaxy-scale
phenomena.

In reality, the assumptions of Bondi accretion — steady
homogeneous ﬂow, spherical symmetry, and adiabaticity —
are unlikely to be valid near the Bondi radius around a
massive galaxy’s SMBH (see, for example, the discussion
in Mathews & Guo 2012). Furthermore, models relying on
standard Bondi accretion have problems generating sufﬁ-
ciently powerful outﬂows without a large boosting factor
(see BS09 for discussion) and with reproducing the proper-
ties of observed cool-core clusters absent ﬁne tuning. An
alternative model for self-regulated accretion, described by
Pizzolato & Soker (2005), posits that the AGN is primarily
fueled by accretion of cold, dense gas that rains down in
a stochastic manner. Aside from the prior assumption that
the AGN heating rate is linked to cooling in the ICM, this
model is supported by observations of cold gas and star for-
mation which indicate that at least some gas is able to cool
(e.g., Edge 2001; Cavagnolo et al. 2008; O’Dea et al. 2008).
In this “moderate cooling ﬂow” or “cold feedback” model,
radial mixing resulting from strong AGN outbursts creates
large inhomogeneities that cool and condense at radii be-
tween 5 and 30 kpc from the AGN. The condensates then rain
down on the SMBH, powering subsequent outbursts. This
model couples the AGN to the cooling properties of the en-
tire cluster core rather than only to the region directly sur-
rounding the SMBH. Importantly, the coupling also occurs
over timescales longer than the freefall in the core, leaving
time for gas to cool and condense. Cold mode feedback
has been implemented in recent simulations, notably those of
Gaspari et al. (2011a,b, 2012); Li & Bryan (2014a,b); Li et al.
(2015), which attain self-regulated states similar to those ob-
served in galaxy-cluster cores.

To mimic the effects of both cold and hot accretion modes,
Booth & Schaye (2009, hereafter referred to as BS09) pro-
posed a model that invokes Bondi accretion with a density-
dependent boost factor. This boost factor equals unity at low
densities, giving the classical Bondi accretion rate, but ramps
up quickly above a pre-chosen density threshold in order to
account, rather crudely, for cooling, condensation, and accre-
tion of condensed gas.

In the simplest models for delivery of AGN feedback, all of
the feedback energy is assumed to thermalize at scales below
the resolution of the grid and is deposited as thermal energy in
a small central region. This approach is used in Springel et al.
(2005a) and subsequent works,
including recent simula-
tions such as the Illustris simulation (Vogelsberger et al.
2014), Rhapsody-G (Hahn et al. 2015) and the simulations
of Rasia et al. (2015).
In reality, AGN outﬂows are likely
asymmetric on scales of several kpc with a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of their energy in kinetic form. Such bipolar outﬂows
may be important for transporting feedback energy to large
distances from the AGN and for mixing metals out to dis-
tances of ∼ 100 kpc from the central galaxy (Kirkpatrick et al.
2011; Kirkpatrick & McNamara 2015). Although much work
has been done studying highly collimated outﬂows on small
scales over short time periods (Vernaleo & Reynolds 2006;
Omma et al. 2004), it is not straightforward to implement
them in large-scale simulations with coarser resolution.

Given the increasing awareness that a proper treatment of
AGN feedback is essential for accurate modeling of the evo-
lution of large galaxies, it is important that the consequences
of different AGN feedback implementations be understood.
The rest of this paper compares several commonly used al-
gorithms for triggering and delivery of AGN feedback in the
context of an idealized galaxy-cluster core, in order to explore

how they differ in representing the coupling of an AGN to its
environment, the total AGN feedback energy produced, and
the resulting thermodynamic proﬁles of the ambient medium.
Section 2 discusses our simulation setup and outlines the trig-
gering and delivery methods we study. Section 3 describes
the results of changing the triggering and delivery algorithms.
Section 4 discusses our results in the context of thermal-
instability analyses of cold gas accumulation and self regu-
lation, along with a discussion of how physical processes that
were not included might have affected our results if they had
been included. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the key results
and points out avenues and opportunities for further study.

2. METHOD

In this work, we consider the interplay between ICM cool-
ing and AGN feedback using a simpliﬁed AGN model in
an idealized galaxy cluster environment. The simulations
are performed using the adaptive mesh hydrodynamics code
Enzo6 (Bryan et al. 2014) and analyzed using the yt7 analy-
sis toolkit (Turk et al. 2011).

2.1. Simulation Environment

Our simulations include hydrodynamics, gravity, radiative
cooling, and AGN feedback. We use a static gravitational po-
tential representing both the cluster and its BCG but do not
account for the self-gravity of the gas, which we assume to
be negligible. We use a tabulated cooling function taken from
Schure et al. (2009), assuming a uniform metallicity of half
the Solar value. This cooling function does not allow gas to
cool below 104 K, which does not affect the qualitative behav-
ior of our simulations, since any processes occurring at lower
temperatures would take place below our spatial resolution
limit. For analysis purposes, we deﬁne any gas below 3 × 104
K as “cold.” Section 4.2 discusses the potential effects of in-
cluding additional physical processes such as magnetic ﬁelds,
conduction, and star formation, which may affect AGN feed-
back but are not included in our simulations.

Unless otherwise noted, the simulation setup encompassed
a box of length 3.2 Mpc per side with a 643 cell root grid and 8
levels of AMR reﬁnement, giving a maximum spatial resolu-
tion of 196 pc. A set of 8 nested grids, centered on the cluster
core, with twice the resolution and half the width of the pre-
vious level, were created during initialization and were never
de-reﬁned. Additional reﬁnement was allowed to occur based
on strong density or energy gradients, baryon overdensity, and
cooling. All cells containing material that was ejected from
the central 10 kpc, as indicated by a passive tracer ﬁeld added
to material within that region, were covered by at least 4 lev-
els of reﬁnement. Finally, the zone around the AGN where
accretion was measured and feedback was applied was always
reﬁned to the maximum level. We do not take cosmological
expansion into account.

2.2. Cluster Setup

Following the work of Li & Bryan (2012), we initialize the
ICM as a hydrostatic sphere of gas within a static spherical
gravitational potential. The gravitational potential comprises
two components: an NFW halo and the stellar mass proﬁle of
the BCG. The virial mass M200 and concentration parameter c
of the NFW halo are deﬁned with respect to the radius within

6 http://enzo-project.org/
7 http://yt-project.org/

which the mean mass density is 200 times the critical density.
For the BCG we assume a mass proﬁle of the form

M∗(r) = M4"

2- β∗

- α∗(cid:0)1 + r/4 kpc(cid:1)β∗- α∗# ,

(cid:0)r/4 kpc(cid:1)

(1)

where M4 is the stellar mass within 4 kpc and α∗ and β∗
are constants. As in Li & Bryan (2012) and Mathews et al.
(2006), we used the Perseus cluster as a template, choosing
M200 = 8.5 × 1014M⊙, c = 6.81 for the NFW halo, M4 = 7.5 ×
1010M⊙, α∗ = 0.1, and β∗ = 1.43 for the BCG. With these
mass proﬁles, the BCG is gravitationally dominant . 10 kpc
from the center, while outside of this radius the NFW halo
dominates the potential.

Although we do not take cosmological expansion into ac-
count in our simulations, we do use a vanilla ΛCDM model
in order to specify the virial mass of the NFW halo and to
set its gas temperature. For initialization, we assume a cluster
at redshift z = 0 and a cosmology with ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7,
and H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. We do not expect our results to be
sensitive to small changes in these parameter values.

The hydrostatic gas in the halo is initialized with an entropy

proﬁle of the form

K(r) = K0 + K100(r/100kpc)αK

(2)

where we use the deﬁnition of speciﬁc entropy used in the
ACCEPT database (Cavagnolo et al. 2009):

K ≡

kBT
n2/3
e

.

(3)

For the Perseus cluster, ACCEPT gives values of K0 = 19.38
keV cm2, K100 = 119.87 keV cm2, and αK = 1.74, and we use
them for our initial conﬁguration. The condition for hydro-
static equilibrium is

dP
dr

= - ρg .

(4)

Together, the the speciﬁed entropy proﬁle and the hydrostatic
condition (equations 2, 3, and 4) give a differential equa-
tion relating temperature and entropy. It remains to specify
a boundary condition so that this equation can be integrated.
Following Voit (2005), the temperature of a hydrostatic ICM
can be approximated as

kBT200 =

µmp
2

[10GM200H(z)]2/3

(5)

We take this as a characteristic temperature for the ICM near
the virial radius and integrate inwards and outwards to ﬁnd
the temperature and density proﬁles for the rest of the cluster.

2.2.1. Tracer Fluid

In order to track the gas directly affected by AGN feedback,
we continuously inject a (passive) tracer ﬂuid into the central
10 kpc. This passive tracer also allows us to measure the ra-
dial extent of feedback heating and also indicates the amount
of metal transport facilitated by AGN jets and rising cavities,
which are thought to play an important role in shaping the
metallicity proﬁles of clusters. The amount of tracer injected
per unit mass ∆ρT is given by

(6)
where we assume a speciﬁc star-formation rate SSFR = 10- 11
yr- 1 and a yield Y = 0.02. These assumptions are meant to be

∆ρT = SSFR ∗Y

4

G. MEECE ET. AL.

a crude approximation for metal injection by the old stellar
population of the BCG. We emphasize that all we are doing is
injecting passive tracer ﬂuid. No actual star formation takes
place, and the tracer ﬂuid does not affect the radiative cooling
rate. Our primary interest is radial transport and distribution
of the tracer ﬂuid. We do not expect its concentration to match
metallicity values in the ICM of observed clusters.

2.3. Feedback and Jet Modeling

AGN are complicated systems governed by physical pro-
cesses that are poorly constrained and span many orders of
magnitude in space and time. Our goal here is not to under-
stand all the details of AGN physics but rather to study the in-
terplay between accretion, jet outﬂows, and the thermal state
of the ICM. To this end, we implement a simpliﬁed “AGN
Particle” model, wherein accretion onto the AGN launches
outﬂows that are insensitive to the details of gas accretion on
scales < 200 pc. We implement several triggering mecha-
nisms, each with a different algorithm for determining the ac-
cretion rate ˙M into the region surrounding the central super-
massive black hole, which sets the scale of the AGN feedback
response. In each case, the resulting output of feedback power
is taken to be ˙E = ǫ ˙Mc2, where ǫ is a feedback efﬁciency factor
and c is the speed of light. The accretion rate ˙M is not nec-
essarily the actual accretion rate onto the central black hole,
and in our idealized implementations no gas is removed from
the simulation volume. Instead, it is assumed to be reheated
and expelled from the vicinity of the black hole by feedback.
Regardless of the triggering mechanism, precessing jets are
launched from disk-shaped regions on either side of the AGN
as described in the following subsections. Please refer to Ta-
ble 1 for ﬁducial values of the AGN feedback parameters.

2.3.1. Triggering Mechanisms

Each of the following triggering methods calculates ˙M and
removes gas mass from the grid within a speciﬁed radius
given by the parameter Racc.
Cold-Gas Triggered Feedback — Meant to replicate the trigger-
ing mechanism used in Li & Bryan (2014a), feedback is trig-
gered by the presence of gas within Racc and at or below a
threshold temperature Tﬂoor. The accretion rate corresponding
to a single cell is

˙Mcell =

Mcell
tacc

(7)

where tacc is a constant timescale. Following Li & Bryan
(2014a), we choose tacc = 5Myr, which is close to the aver-
age freefall time near the accretion radius.

Boosted Bondi-like Triggering — The accretion rate is set to the
Bondi accretion rate derived from conditions within Racc and
multiplied by a constant boost factor α so that

˙M = α

2πG2M2
(ˆv2 + ˆcs

BH ˆρ
2)3/2

(8)

where G is the gravitational constant, MBH is the mass of the
black hole, and ˆρ, ˆv, and ˆcs are the mass- averaged density,
velocity magnitude, and sound speed within Racc. In this work
we adopt α = 100. Mass is removed from each cell within Racc
in a mass-averaged sense, such that

∆Mcell =

˙M ∆t

depends on the gas density as

(n/n0)β

n ≤ n0
n > n0

(10)

Following Booth & Schaye (2009), we take n0 = 0.1 cm- 3 and
β = 2.

2.3.2. Jet Implementation

After the total accretion rate ˙M during a timestep ∆t is cal-
culated with one of these triggering methods, a corresponding
amount of feedback energy ǫ ˙Mc2 ∆t is added to the ejected
gas. We assume the ejected mass to be equal to ˙M∆t, which
is an idealization. In reality, the mass-loading factor of the
jets will depend on subgrid physics that is not yet well under-
stood. However, Dubois et al. (2012) ﬁnd that the choice of
mass-loading factor does not strongly affect their results.

A fraction fk of the feedback energy is added to the ejected
mass as kinetic energy, while the rest is added as thermal en-
ergy. This naturally results in a jet velocity of

vJet = cp2ǫ fkinetic

(11)
or around v ≈ 0.045c for our ﬁducial parameter choices. Ki-
netic energy and the associated mass are put into the grid
through two disks each of radius RD located on either side
of the AGN at a distance RJ from the center. The jets are ori-
ented at a ﬁxed angle φJet with respect to the z axis and precess
around it with a period τjet.

For simulations with pure thermal feedback ( fk = 0), we
again follow the method of BS09 in order to prevent the in-
jected thermal energy from immediately being radiated away.
Feedback energy is stored up until enough accumulates to
heat the gas in the injection zone to at least Tmin = 107 K. Ex-
ploratory simulations with Tmin = 108 did not show a notice-
able difference in behavior, in agreement with BS09. We ob-
serve that this algorithm results in a series of thermal pulses as
AGN feedback is ramping up, but comes close to steady injec-
tion when the AGN power is high. We performed tests using
this injection threshold with some kinetic feedback ( fK > 0.0)
but did not observe a noticeable difference when compared to
simulations with continuous energy injection.

Unless otherwise noted we use the parameters given in Ta-

ble 1 for all simulations.

TRIGGERING AND DELIVERY ALGORITHMS FOR AGN FEEDBACK

2.4. Hydro Method

The simulations in this work use a 3D version of the
ZEUS hydrodynamics method (Stone & Norman 1992) be-
cause of its robustness and speed. ZEUS is known to be a
relatively diffusive method and requires an artiﬁcial viscos-
ity term that may affect the accuracy of our hydrodynamics
calculations. We have experimented with using a piecewise-
parabolic method (PPM) (Colella & Woodward 1984), but en-
countered numerical difﬁculties relating to the strong discon-
tinuities occurring at the injection site.

3. RESULTS

The most striking differences within our suite of simula-
tions are between AGN feedback algorithms that deliver all
of the feedback in thermal form ( fk = 0) and those that de-
liver at least some kinetic feedback ( fk > 0). Changes in
the triggering method produce smaller differences in quali-
tative behavior, probably because all three triggering methods
implemented here end up strongly boosting the feedback re-
sponse when signiﬁcant amounts of cold gas accumulate near
the central black hole. We will therefore present our results on
delivery mechanisms ﬁrst and triggering mechanisms second.

3.1. Delivery of Feedback: Thermal vs. Kinetic

Injection of AGN feedback energy heats the surrounding
gas through several processes. First, if fk < 1.0, then the AGN
directly injects thermal energy into the ICM. Second, interac-
tions between the AGN outﬂow and the ICM produce shocks
that propagate outward and heat the ambient gas in a quasi-
isotropic manner. Third, outﬂows drive turbulence that can
heat the ICM as the turbulence decays. Finally, momentum
from the AGN outﬂow—either directly injected in the form of
a kinetic jet or driven by thermal expansion of hot bubbles—
can dredge low-entropy gas out of the core and mix it with
higher entropy gas at larger radii.

3.1.1. Feedback Power

All of our simulations with fk > 0.0 follow similar pat-
terns of evolution. Initially, the cluster core is smooth, spher-
ically symmetric, and contains no cold gas. The core gas then
cools, contracts, and grows denser for ∼ 0.3 Gyr until cold
clouds begin to condense at the center and strongly boost the
jet power. Figure 1 shows both the jet power and cooling
luminosity within different radii during the ﬁrst 2 Gyr of a
cold-gas triggered feedback simulation that delivers 50% of
the feedback power as kinetic energy. Notice that the core
achieves approximate long-term balance when the jet power
rises to match the cooling luminosity from within the cen-
tral ∼ 100 kpc. This is typical of our simulations that have
a signiﬁcant fraction of the feedback power in kinetic form.
However, the total feedback power becomes much greater in
simulations with purely thermal feedback.

Figure 2 illustrates the vast difference in feedback power
between our simulations with fk = 0 and those with fk > 0.
Pure thermal feedback eventually saturates at a power level
more than two orders of magnitude greater than in the simu-
lations with some kinetic feedback, even when compared to
the case with fk = 0.25. Furthermore, it can be seen that the
average feedback power in the self-regulated systems with at
least some kinetic power is not monotonically dependent on
fk. As long as some of the feedback power is kinetic, self-
regulation happens at a power level of ∼ 1045 erg s- 1, which
is similar to the time-averaged AGN power inferred from

McNamara & Nulsen 2012).

3.1.2. Cold Gas Accumulation

Feedback power becomes excessively large in the fk = 0
case because pure thermal feedback is ineffective at prevent-
ing large amounts of cold gas from accumulating. Figure 3
shows that ∼ 1012 M⊙ of cold gas accumulates in less than
1 Gyr when fk = 0, whereas . 1010 M⊙ accumulates during
the same time period in simulations with at least some kinetic
power. The large cold-gas reservoir in the fk = 0 case is not
sufﬁciently disrupted by thermal feedback and therefore pro-
vides enough cold fuel for the AGN to maintain a feedback
power exceeding 1047 erg s- 1. Even at this power level, the
AGN fails to eject or eliminate much of the cold gas because
the cold gas is very efﬁcient at radiating away feedback en-
ergy owing to the n2 dependence of the cooling rate. The re-
sult is that the feedback energy that does go into the cold gas
is almost immediately radiated away. Further, feedback en-
ergy tends to propagate more readily through the hot ambient
medium along the paths of least resistance, and ends up in-
creasing the thermal energy of the diffuse, volume-ﬁlling gas
without diminishing the mass of cold gas embedded within it.
If star formation had been allowed to proceed in our simu-
lations, much of the cold gas that accumulates near the center
would eventually have formed stars. The results shown in Fig-
ure 3 therefore indicate that that pure thermal feedback would
permit a time-averaged star-formation rate ∼ 102- 3M⊙ yr- 1
during the ﬁrst ∼ 1 Gyr, which is much larger than observed
in all but the most actively star-forming galaxy cluster cores
(O’Dea et al. 2008). In order to understand why kinetic feed-
back is so much more successful than thermal feedback in
suppressing cold gas accumulation and the star formation that
would result, we need to look at how the choice of fk affects
the radial distribution of density, temperature, and entropy in

the hot ambient medium.

3.1.3. Radial Proﬁles

Figure 4 shows how the average values of density, temper-
ature, entropy, and concentration of tracer ﬂuid change over
time at each radius in simulations with mixed kinetic and ther-
mal feedback ( fk = 0.5, left panels) and pure thermal feedback
( fk = 0, right panels). Gas outside of ∼ 100 kpc is not shown
because it does not evolve appreciably over 2 Gyr, as the
cooling time at large radii is long and little of the AGN feed-
back energy propagates to those radii. Inside of 100 kpc, the
fk = 0.5 simulation reaches a nearly steady state in ∼ 0.5 Gyr,
with density, temperature, and entropy continuing to ﬂuctuate
within narrow ranges after that time. The proﬁles of the tracer

ﬂuid concentration do not reach a steady state, as the tracer
is continuously injected over time and distributed outward by
the jet. However, those proﬁles do show that tracer ﬂuid is
quickly mixed with the ambient gas out to & 50 kpc from the
center.

In contrast, the simulation with fk = 0 does not reach a
steady state.
In particular, the azimuthally averaged spe-
ciﬁc entropy of gas outside of the central few kpc steadily
rises with time, causing a steady drop in ambient density
and a steady rise in ambient temperature.
Initially, some
of the increase in mean entropy comes from the removal of
low-entropy gas through condensation (Voit & Bryan 2001;
Voit et al. 2002; Nagai et al. 2007). However, the mean en-
tropy at & 10 kpc continues to rise during the second Gyr of
the simulation, after condensation of cold gas has leveled off.
This rise is due to continual input of thermal energy by AGN
feedback, a small fraction of which escapes the inner few kpc
and propagates into the ICM, causing pressure-driven expan-
sion of the ambient medium. The right-hand panel of Figure 2
shows that AGN feedback in the fk = 0 simulation has injected
∼ 1064 erg after 2 Gyr, which is comparable to the binding en-
ergy of the entire intracluster medium, although most of this
is radiated away by the cold gas. The fraction that does escape
the central clump of cold gas slows the condensation process
by inﬂating the cluster core and driving the cooling time of the
ambient medium at ∼ 10 kpc to ∼ 5 Gyr but fails to establish
a self-regulated feedback loop.

Despite the high AGN power, this simulation is not able to
prevent a buildup of cold gas for two reasons: (1) feedback
energy does not propagate far enough from the center, and
(2) thermal feedback cannot destroy a large cold-gas reser-
voir, once it develops. As illustrated in Figure 5, almost all
of the cooling comes from the central 10 kpc where there is a
concentration of cold gas with a very short cooling time. Al-
though gas at the temperature ﬂoor does not cool, a small rise
in temperature greatly increases its cooling rate and prevents
the cold gas from heating to the ambient temperature.

The development of a large cold-gas reservoir is closely re-
lated to the failure of thermal feedback to propagate feedback
energy beyond the central ∼ 30 kpc. Figure 6 shows the rms
gas velocity as a function of radius in simulations with dif-

in rms velocity beyond ∼ 30 kpc which is not seen in the sim-
ulations having some kinetic feedback. Apparently, kinetic

large radii.

roundings. In this set of simulations, centrally injected hot
bubbles stop rising and blend with the ambient medium at
∼ 30 kpc, as indicated by the rms velocity curves in Figure
6, as well as the propagation of tracer ﬂuid in panel H of Fig-
ure 4. We therefore conclude that our implementation of pure
thermal feedback does not add much heat to gas in the 30–
100 kpc range of radii but instead steadily raises the entropy of
ambient gas at 10–30 kpc, which ﬂattens its entropy gradient.
Kinetic feedback, on the other hand does propagate beyond

This discrepancy arises because outward propagation of
centrally injected thermal feedback is limited by the amount
of entropy it can generate. It creates central bubbles of hot
gas which can buoyantly rise only until they reach a layer of

and idealized setup are not capable of self-consistently mod-
eling jet precession. Instead, we follow Li & Bryan (2014a)
and force the jets to precess around a ﬁxed axis. Previous
studies have found that some precession is necessary for self-
regulation if the jets are highly collimated. Otherwise, they
drill long, narrow channels through the ICM and deposit the
bulk of their energy far from the zone in which self-regulation
can happen Vernaleo & Reynolds (2006).

Figure 7 shows slices of four simulations performed with
different jet precession angles. When the jets do not pre-
cess (θ jet = 0), they carve channels through the ICM that
extend well beyond ∼ 40 kpc. However, due to Kelvin-
Helmholz instabilities and artiﬁcial viscosity in the ZEUS
code, they still produce some heating close to the AGN but
do not drive strong shocks. With a small precession angle
(θ jet = 0.15,0.25), each jet continually encounters cold clouds
of condensing material that block its path. These jet-cloud
interactions randomly divert the jets, depositing their energy
in a wider range of directions, which causes more of their ki-
netic energy to thermalize at smaller radii. Precession also
produces more turbulence and creates shocks that propagate
outward over a large range of solid angles. As the precession
angle increases, the jet energy spreads over a larger range of
solid angles at ever smaller radii, and jet-cloud collisions be-
come more frequent. As seen in the last panel of Figure 7, this
leads to a more disturbed morphology at . 20 kpc and a larger
mass of accumulated cold gas. In that respect, kinetic feed-
back with a very large precession angle becomes more like
thermal feedback, in that feedback energy does not propagate
as far from the center before it becomes thermalized.

3.1.4. Jet Precession

In addition to the breakdown between kinetic and thermal
feedback, we have also investigated the role of jet precession.
Jets from AGN can reorient themselves on timescales of a few
tens of Myr (Dunn et al. 2006; Babul et al. 2013), but the de-
tails of this process are still uncertain, and our subgrid model

tiphase medium in the region surrounding the AGN. Since all
of the triggering mechanisms considered are dependent on gas
density, a cold, dense clump of gas accreting will trigger a
large outburst regardless of the details of the triggering algo-
rithm. The outburst will continue until the cold gas is gone,
ensuring that roughly the same amount of energy is released
in all cases. The cold gas would not necessary be resolved by
simulations with coarser resolution, implying that those sim-
ulations might be more sensitive to the choice of triggering
algorithm.

Each triggering mechanism depends on gas density either
directly (BS and Boosted Bondi-like accretion) or indirectly
(cold gas triggering), and in the BS and Boosted Bondi-like
cases the boost parameters have been chosen to provide the
“right” amount of feedback. Due to the density-dependent
accretion rate, a cold clump falling into the accretion zone
then always produces a surge in jet power that continues until
the clump is either completely heated or completely accreted.
Figure 9 shows total jet power (thermal + kinetic) versus
time for simulations with different triggering mechanisms. In

12

the Bondi-like and BS runs, feedback is always active, but the
power level is relatively low before cold gas starts to condense
and drives up the AGN accretion rate. After condensation be-
gins, all three triggering mechanisms lead to self-regulated jet
power levels that are nearly identical. Figure 10 shows the
radial proﬁles of various quantities in the ambient hot ICM
after 2 Gyr for each triggering mechanism. There are some
differences in the inner 10 kpc, but this zone is strongly af-
fected by the quickly varying jet, producing proﬁles that are
variable with time (see Figure 4). Between 10 and 30 kpc,
the run with cold-gas triggering is slightly colder and more
susceptible to thermal instability than the other runs, based on
the lower tcool/tff ratio. Beyond 30 kpc, there are no signiﬁ-
cant differences between runs with different triggering mech-
anisms.

3.3. Accretion Radius

In cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster evolution,
one would like a subgrid model for AGN feedback that gives
reliable results for the SMBH accretion rate even when the
Bondi radius (let alone the Schwarzschild radius) is not re-
solved. At spatial resolutions coarser than ∼ 0.5 kpc, the
size of the “accretion zone” that determines AGN feedback
power will necessarily be larger than that used in our ﬁdu-
cial simulations. With this increase in Racc, the responses of
AGN triggering algorithms will depend on conditions at larger
radii, which can couple AGN feedback to ICM properties at
greater distances but may also permit larger amounts of gas to
condense before the AGN feedback response becomes strong
enough to oppose cooling.

To understand how the size of the accretion zone affects
AGN triggering, we have carried out simulations in which
Racc is increased to 2 kpc. The maximum spatial resolution
remains the same, with a smallest cell width of 196 pc, mean-
ing that the accretion radius is always resolved by multiple
cells. In carrying out these simulations we set the distance RJ
of the disk-shaped jet injection region equal to Racc, so that the
jet emanates from the edge of the accretion sphere, not from
within it.

Figure 11 shows jet power as a function of time for the sim-
ulations with a larger accretion radius. In all three simula-
tions, ﬂuctuations in jet power are noticeably smaller than in
the ﬁducial case. With the exception of the Boosted Bondi-
like run the cumulative jet power is comparable to the earlier
runs, and we did not observe quantitative differences in the
ICM properties. However, the Boosted Bondi-like simulation,
in which AGN feedback power now depends on average gas
properties within a larger volume, takes longer to ramp up,
resulting in a large (> 1012) mass of cold gas and a higher
cumulative jet power.

4. DISCUSSION

Our simulations have shown that different triggering and
delivery methods for subgrid models of AGN feedback can
have profoundly different effects on the resulting properties of
the ICM. We are not attempting to determine which method is
the most accurate model of an AGN but rather to analyze the
reasons for those differences. In each case, tracking the ac-
cumulation of cold-gas fuel is critical, meaning that we must
consider what allows gas to transition from the hot ambient
medium into the cold-gas fuel reservoir. In this section, we
discuss that transition and consider the potential effects of
physical processes not included in our models.

4.1. Precipitation and AGN Fueling

Clearly, our simulations with pure thermal feedback behave
markedly differently than simulations with kinetic feedback,
even when fk is small. The pure thermal feedback runs ex-
perience a large buildup of cold gas that essentially smothers
the AGN, causing it to ﬁght back with increasingly power-
ful bursts. The ICM in the vicinity of the AGN is subject to
both radiative cooling and heating from mixing, dissipation,
and shocks. Thus, analyzing the thermal stability of the ICM
may give insight into the accumulation of cold gas and help to
explain the differences that arise from among these feedback
algorithms.

Voit et al. (2015) presented evidence for a “precipitation
triggered” model for coupling the AGN power to the cool-
ing rate of the ICM. In the precipitation model, the cooling
ICM becomes thermally unstable, leading to the condensa-
tion of cold gas. This cold gas is then accreted by the AGN,
triggering feedback. The feedback heats the ICM, restoring
thermal stability and reducing further accretion. As cosmo-
logical simulations typically lack the resolution to model the
condensation process itself, the thermal instability criterion
can be used to predict the amount of cold gas available for
accretion. For a gravitationally stratiﬁed medium, one would
expect that thermal stability would be related to two natural
timescales — the cooling timescale tcool and the dynamical
timescale tff. Simulations (McCourt et al. 2012; Sharma et al.
2012) ﬁnd that the formation of cold gas from a thermally
unstable medium can occur whenever tcool/tff . 10 (But see
Meece et al. (2015), which ﬁnds that condensation can oc-
cur for larger values in some circumstances.) Similarly, the
observations of Voit & Donahue (2015) and Cavagnolo et al.
(2008) show that clusters with tcool/tff . 10 are likely to ex-
hibit multiphase gas, while clusters above that ratio do not.

Figure 12 shows the distributions of tcool/tff and speciﬁc en-
tropy (K) for simulations with pure thermal ( fk = 0.0) and part
kinetic ( fk = 0.5) feedback. Panel A of Figure 12 shows that
the ICM in the thermal feedback simulation is divided into
two phases. First, there is a hot phase with tcool/tff ≫ 10 that
occupies the bulk of the volume outside of 10 kpc. Second,
there is a large accumulation of cold gas that nearly smoth-
ers the AGN. The cold gas mass builds up quickly and then
stops growing when the cooling time in the hot ICM rises to
several Gyr. Outbursts of thermal feedback sporadically pro-
pel streamers and blobs of cool gas radially outwards from
the AGN. These cold streamers travel out several tens of kpc
before turning around and raining back down onto the core.
Panel C shows that there is a large spread in tcool/tff and K in
the 10–30 kpc range. Most of the gas at intermediate values
of tcool/tff does not represent condensation in the usual sense.
Instead, it is gas in the boundary layers of the streamers that is
either cooling onto them or being heated by interactions with
the hot ICM.

As Panels B, D, and F of Figure 12 illustrate, the gas prop-
erties of the ICM for the simulation with fk = 0.5 are very
different. The ICM has much lower mean values of tcool/tff

tent with Li & Bryan (2014b), this condensation occurs at the
jet/ICM interface where the jet generates non-linear entropy
ﬂuctuations by uplifting low-entropy gas close to the AGN
to greater heights, where it then condenses and falls back to-
ward the center. These condensates are then accreted by the
AGN, powering the jets and maintaining thermal balance in
the cluster.

In this study, both our setup and our implementation of
AGN feedback have been simpliﬁed in order to focus on the
essential features of coupling between the AGN and the ICM.
Of course, the situation in real clusters is more complicated
than our model. In addition to these simpliﬁcations, there are
a number of possibly relevant physical processes that we have
not included in our model, both to simplify the problem and to
reduce the computational resources required. These processes
and their potential effects are discussed in this section.

The dramatic differences in the behavior of the cold gas and
the jet in these simulations has to do with how the AGN dis-
tributes energy to the surrounding gas. In the pure thermal
feedback case, the gas heated by the AGN at ﬁrst tends to fol-
low the path of least resistance, bypassing the denser gas near
the core. This leads to an accumulation of cold gas with a
very short cooling time, which is able to absorb and reradi-
ate the AGN feedback at later times. The AGN injects energy
very close to the center of the cluster, where it is immediately
radiated away by cold gas.
In the ( fk simulation, the out-
ﬂow creates a hot cocoon around itself that rapidly rises. This
outﬂow lifts the central gas outward, which helps disrupt the
cooling ﬂow and pulls some low-entropy gas upward along
with the jets. The kinetic outﬂow also allows the feedback en-
ergy to penetrate to larger radii (> 10 kpc) and heat the ICM
at greater radii. This helps to maintain the balance of heat-
ing and cooling globally and prevents the ICM from dividing
into a hot and a cold phase. The jet is able to heat gas further
out, through mixing, turbulent decay and weak shocks, which
prevents the cooling time of a large fraction of the ICM from
going below 10tff. Thus, a cluster with a warmer, less dense
core will require less energy input to regulate than a cluster
with a cold, dense core.

In addition to depositing feedback further out, the kinetic
outﬂows allow cooling gas to mix with the hot gas in the jet.
This increases the cooling time of the ICM and strongly in-
hibits the formation of more cold gas. The cold or cooling
gas that is not accreted is soon swept up in the jet, where
it is disrupted or heated. The jet thus prevents the cold gas
from smothering the AGN, allowing the feedback to heat the
ICM rather than quickly radiating away. This explains why a
weaker AGN is able to regulate the ICM in the kinetic jet case
than in the more powerful pure thermal feedback case.

4.2. Caveats and Additional Physics

4.2.1. Conduction

Our simulations do not include thermal conduction, either
isotropic or along magnetic ﬁelds. From a theoretical point
of view (Voit et al. 2015, 2008), while conduction may well
be important for regulating the thermal state of warm-core
clusters, cool-core clusters lie below the tcool proﬁle at which
conductive transport can balance radiative losses. Smith et al.
(2013) has simulated cool-core clusters with thermal conduc-
tion but without AGN feedback, and concludes that thermal
conduction is not able to prevent the cooling catastrophe on
its own and does not have a large impact on global cluster
properties. However, conduction could well be important for
the precipitation theory, as strong conduction could smooth
out the perturbations that evolve into non-linear overdensities.
Wagh et al. (2014) have investigated the effects of conduction
on thermal stability and found that conduction would need to
be quite strong to prevent condensation.

4.2.2. Magnetic Fields

The intra-cluster medium is known to be weakly magne-
tized (Carilli & Taylor 2002). Overall, the magnetic ﬁeld is
believed to be tangled and dynamically unimportant. How-
ever, magnetic ﬁelds may affect heat transport in the core by
making conduction anisotropic, as the electrons that mediate
conduction will travel more easily along ﬁeld lines than per-
pendicular to them. The importance of anisotropic conduction
will depend on the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, the devel-
opment of plasma instabilities, and stirring of the plasma by
galaxy motions or AGN outﬂows. A tangled magnetic ﬁeld
would be expected to supress conduction to roughly 1/3 of
the Spitzer value. However, a weakly magnetized, conduct-
ing ICM with a temperature gradient might be susceptable

to either the magnetothermal instability (MTI; Balbus 2000,
2001; Quataert 2008) or the heat-ﬂux-driven buoyancy insta-
bility (HBI; Quataert 2008; Parrish et al. 2009). In cool-core
clusters, the HBI would align the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to an outward temperature gradient, limiting the inward heat
ﬂux. However, simulations such as Ruszkowski et al. (2011)
have found that anisotropic thermal conduction is not strong
enough to reorient the magnetic ﬁelds, and Yang & Reynolds
(2015) ﬁnd that stirring by the AGN would overcome the HBI,
leading to conduction with an effectiveness of > 0.2 times the
Spitzer value.

While not dynamically important on large scales, magnetic
ﬁelds may affect the precipitation and AGN feedback pro-
cesses. Wagh et al. (2014) found that anisotropic conduc-
tion will not prevent condensation unless the ﬁeld is very
strong. Magnetic ﬁelds may be stronger and dynamically
important close to the AGN, where jet induced turbulence
and ﬁeld injection from the jet may amplify the magnetic
ﬁeld (Dubois et al. 2009; Sutter et al. 2012; Ruszkowski et al.
2011). Along the AGN jets, magnetic draping is thought
to play an important role in preserving cavities and cold
fronts against disruption from Kelvin-Helmholz instabili-
ties (Ruszkowski et al. 2007; Dursi & Pfrommer 2008). The
preservation of cavities would change the mode of heat trans-
port in the cluster, because inﬂating cavities and rising bub-
bles would be better able to stir turbulence, transport hot gas
to larger radii, and dredge up cold gas in their wake.

4.2.3. Star Formation

BCGs in many cool core clusters are observed to be
forming stars (O’Dea et al. 2008, 2010; Loubser et al. 2015;
McDonald et al. 2015), but stellar feedback alone can not
prevent the cooling catastrophe in cool-core clusters (e.g.
Skory et al. 2013). Although we do not include star forma-
tion in our model, Li et al. (2015) use a setup very similar to
our ﬁducial model to perform an extensive investigation of the
role of star formation in regulating AGN feedback. One ex-
pects the star formation rate (SFR) of a BCG to be related to
the amount of multiphase gas present. Li et al. (2015) do see
a correlation between AGN feedback and the SFR. In those
simulations, stellar feedback is less effective than the AGN at
heating the ICM but more effective at consuming cold gas. If
the AGN is in a low-power state, a central reservoir of cold
gas builds up and boosts the AGN power on a ∼ 100 Myr
timescale. AGN feedback then heats the ICM and slows the
rate of gas condensation. However, the AGN remains power-
ful until star formation consumes the cold gas in the central
reservoir on a ∼ 2 Gyr timescale. Without cold clouds to fuel
it, the AGN feedback power subsides, and another cycle soon
begins as the ambient medium once again cools and becomes
thermally unstable. Thus, the primary effect of star forma-
tion is to regulate the cycling behavior of the AGN on Gyr
timescales.

4.3. Comparison With Similar Studies

As the importance of AGN feedback has gained greater ap-
preciation in recent years, several studies have been carried
out to investigate the best way to implement AGN feedback
in simulations. It is difﬁcult to do a comprehensive compari-
son between our results and those of previous studies as those
works have generally sampled a limited fraction of the AGN
feedback parameter space or assume vastly different initial
conditions than we do here.

The chief aim of this paper is to better understand which as-
pects of AGN feedback implementations are most decisive in
determining the qualitative consequences of sub-grid models
for AGN feedback. With this in mind, we discuss the ma-
jor differences between our implementation and some AGN
implementations used in related studies of AGN feedback.
Where possible, we compare our results to those obtained us-
ing these other algorithms. Note that in addition to the major
differences discussed here, there are many other small differ-
ences in the details of how AGN feedback is implemented
and in the choices of physical models considered. As demon-
strated by Section 3, the results of an AGN feedback simula-
tion may be sensitive to seemingly small differences in imple-
mentation, and caution should be taken when comparing one
set of results to another.

4.3.1. Li & Bryan 2012-2015

The cluster and AGN model employed in our paper are
largely an extension of the Li & Bryan simulations of AGN
feedback (Li & Bryan 2012, 2014a,b; Li et al. 2015), with
only small changes to the cluster and jet model (although we
extend the range of triggering and feedback parameters). Both
our study and theirs use Enzo.

Given the similarities of our setups, it is not surprising that
our simulations give similar results. Our maximum spatial
resolution is slightly coarser (196 pc vs. 60 pc), but we ob-
tain similar behavior for similar choices of feedback parame-
ters. Our ﬁndings indicate that the Li & Bryan results should
be relatively insensitive to variations in the triggering mech-
anism, the amount of AGN precession, and the details of the
accretion process. Both studies ﬁnd that the behavior of the
AGN is relatively insensitive to the kinetic fraction of the out-
ﬂow as long as the kinetic fraction is non-zero. Our study
does ﬁnd that the mass of cold gas formed depends strongly
on the AGN implementation, but does not affect the long term
behavior of the simulation. We generally see a mass of cold
gas that is an order of magnitude less than what Li & Bryan
found in their ﬁducial model but obtain a similar mass when
we use the same set of parameters. This variability in the cold
gas mass is consistent with the parameter variation studies in
Li & Bryan (2014a).

4.3.2. Gaspari et al. 2011

Gaspari et al. (2011b) simulate AGN feedback using the
FLASH code (Fryxell et al. 2000). They model an idealized
version of the cluster Abell 1795 within a static and spheri-
cally symmetric gravitational potential using a set of physical
processes similar to those used here. The minimum resolu-
tion in their study is 2.7 kpc. AGN feedback is modeled as a
purely mechanical jet with either cold or hot (Bondi-like) trig-
gering and different jet efﬁciencies. They also consider both
steady and intermittent jets. For Bondi-like triggering, the ac-
cretion rate is calculated from the properties of gas within 5
or 10 kpc. Gaspari et al. (2011a) uses a similar AGN model
but a gravitational potential appropriate for a galaxy group.

Gaspari et al. (2011b) ﬁnds that both a cold gas triggered
and a Bondi triggered AGN implementation are able to bal-
ance radiative cooling and preserve a cool-core state. The
most successful cold gas model (model A3 in that paper) is
signiﬁcantly more bursty than our simulations, with a duty
cycle of only 6%, resulting in only around 50 outbursts each
with power on the order of 1048 erg/s. The total injected en-
ergy after 2 Gyr is on the order of 1061 erg, consistent with

16

G. MEECE ET. AL.

our results. We attribute the observed difference in outburst
power and duty cycle to the choice of accretion radius, where
we use 0.5 kpc and they use 10 kpc. As seen in Figure 11 in
our paper, increasing the size of the accretion radius results in
a larger variation in AGN power. This follows from more cold
gas being able to ﬁt inside the larger accretion zone and from
the difﬁculty of expelling cold gas from a larger gravitational
well.

In agreement with our results, Gaspari et al. (2011b) ﬁnds
that Bondi feedback with a large averaging zone (10 kpc in
their simulations) is not able to halt the cooling catastrophe.
Their model with an averaging zone of 5 kpc is able to bal-
ance cooling over a long period of time. Unlike the cold
gas triggered case, the Bondi implementation results in a low
power (order 1044 erg/s) jet with little variation in intensity.
In our simulations, the Bondi and cold-triggered implemen-
tations act similarly when using an accretion radius/averaging
zone of 0.5 kpc. We ascribe this to the higher resolution of our
simulations, which are able to resolve the cold gas directly.

4.3.3. Yang et al. 2012

Yang et al. (2012) examines the effect of different AGN
subgrid models on observable properties of simulated galaxy
clusters. They model an idealized cluster with virial mass
1.5 × 1014M⊙ and a polytropic equation of state, also using
FLASH. The minimum resolution of these simulations is 1.0
kpc. The physical processes considered are again similar to
ours, while the AGN feedback model is somewhat different,
consisting of either large (tens of kpc) thermal bubbles offset
from the core or jets with widths of a few kpc. The accre-
tion rate was determined from the Bondi rate, with a constant
boost factor ranging from 1 to 100 in different runs.

Although Yang et al. (2012) do consider jets with pure ther-
mal feedback (as well as thermal bubbles originating near the
AGN), they do not see the same smothering behavior that we
do. In fact, the gas in their simulations does not become very
dense, rarely exceeding densities of ne = 10- 1 cm- 3. We at-
tribute these differences to the ﬁner resolution of our simula-
tions, which allow us to resolve the condensation process and
the formation of cold gas near the AGN.

4.3.4. Dubois et al. 2012

Dubois et al. (2012) compare thermal and mechanical feed-
back in cosmological simulations using the code RAMSES.
The simulations generally have a minimum resolution of 1.52
kpc, but some runs have higher resolution. The AGN power
is determined using the BS09 method. Thermal energy is re-
leased in a sphere of a a few cells near the AGN, while kinetic
feedback is released in a jet. Similar to Yang et al. (2012),
they do not observe AGN smothering, but again employ a
coarser resolution than we use in our simulations.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out a controlled comparison of several
commonly used sub-grid implementations of AGN feedback.
Our model treats the AGN as a particle sitting in the core of
an idealized cool-core cluster. The AGN is triggered based on
local conditions (either the amount of cold gas or the Bondi
rate, with either a ﬁxed or a density dependent boost) and re-
turns energy to the ICM as either centralized thermal blasts, a
kinetic jet, or a mix of thermal and kinetic energy. Our main
conclusions are:

1. Purely thermal feedback produces very different results
than feedback with even a small kinetic component. In
the pure thermal case, the AGN is initially unable to in-
hibit cooling immediately outside of the core, leading to
a buildup of cold gas. This gas smothers the AGN and
immediately radiates away the feedback energy, even
if the feedback zone itself is heated to a high temper-
ature. This also results in heating of the ICM outside
of the core through a combination of shock heating and
preferential condensation of low entropy gas. Adding
a kinetic component allows the AGN to propagate en-
ergy outside of the core and prevents smothering of the
AGN.

2. When some fraction of the feedback is returned as a
kinetic jet, the AGN is able to prevent the large accu-
mulation of cold gas that results from a cooling catas-
trophe. Instead, AGN feedback self-regulates the ICM
in a quasi-steady state with tcool/tff ∼ 10 at . 20 kpc.
The cluster core is cooler overall than the case with
pure thermal feedback, but contains much less cold gas
around the AGN.

3. We do observe large differences between cold-gas trig-
gered feedback, boosted Bondi-like triggering or Booth
and Schaye accretion, as long as the “accretion zone”
used to determine the AGN fueling rate is sufﬁciently
small (∼ 200 pc). This is probably because all three
methods, by design, end up triggering strong AGN
feedback when cold clouds begin to accumulate in the
accretion zone.

4. Increasing the size of the accretion zone (to 2 kpc) re-
duces short-term variation in jet power but does not sig-
niﬁcantly alter the total amount of AGN feedback or
the global ICM properties in the cold-gas triggered or
Booth and Schaye cases. However, the boosted Bondi-
like simulation does not achieve self-regulation, be-
cause AGN feedback does not ramp up fast enough to
prevent a cooling catastrophe, resulting in a large cen-
tral accumulation of cold gas.

5. Very large jet precession angles distribute the AGN
feedback energy, making simulations with signiﬁcant
kinetic output behave more like simulations having
pure thermal feedback. This happens because the ki-
netic energy does not escape to large radii and thermal-
izes closer to the AGN when it is spread over too large
a solid angle.

Further improvements to sub-grid feedback models and a
better understanding of the AGN feedback process are nec-
essary for the next generation of galaxy and galaxy cluster
simulations. On a theoretical level, much work is currently
being done on the link between thermal instability, cold gas
formation, and its role in triggering feedback. Ongoing ob-
servations with Chandra and XMM-Newton as well as future
observations with the Smart-X and Athena missions will give
a better understanding how the AGN feedback process oper-
ates in real clusters. Finally, new implementations must be de-
veloped for capturing the connection between AGN and their
environments. While the simulations in this work have a max-
imum resolution of ∼ 200 pc, cosmological simulations and
simulations with more complicated physics generally have
& kpc resolution due to computational resource limits.
In

future work, we will aim at translating the results from this
project into a sub-grid implementation that can be used at
these coarser resolutions.
