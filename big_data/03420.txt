The momentum transfer between a photon and an object deﬁnes a fundamental limit for the
precision with which the object can be measured. If the object oscillates at a frequency Ω0, this
measurement back-action adds quanta ¯hΩ0 to the oscillator’s energy at a rate Γrecoil, a process
called photon recoil heating, and sets bounds to coherence times in cavity optomechanical systems.
Here, we use an optically levitated nanoparticle in ultrahigh vacuum to directly measure Γrecoil.
By means of a phase-sensitive feedback scheme, we cool the harmonic motion of the nanoparticle
from ambient to micro-Kelvin temperatures and measure its reheating rate under the inﬂuence of
the radiation ﬁeld. The recoil heating rate is measured for diﬀerent particle sizes and for diﬀerent
excitation powers, without the need for cavity optics or cryogenic environments. The measure-
ments are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and provide valuable guidance for
the realization of quantum ground-state cooling protocols and the measurement of ultrasmall forces.

Our ability to detect ultraweak forces depends on
both the noise and sensitivity of the measurement.
An optical position sensor, for example,
irradiates an
object with light and detects the scattered photons.
As each photon carries momentum p = ¯hk, we can
increase the optical power to reduce the object’s posi-
tion uncertainty to ∆x ≥ 1/(2k
N ), where N is the
number of scattered photons.
Increasing the optical
power, however, increases the rate of momentum kicks
from individual photons and results in a force due to
radiation pressure shot noise (RPSN), which perturbs
the inspected object. While increasing power reduces
our measurement imprecision, RPSN places limits on
the information gained from a system [1, 2].

√

Remarkable advances in micro-fabrication have re-
sulted in high-Q mechanical resonators required for
enhanced force sensitivity. In addition to ground state
cooling [3, 4], recent experiments in cryogenic chambers
with silicon nitride membranes, cold-atomic clouds, and
microwave devices have veriﬁed the inﬂuence of RPSN
in continuous position and force measurements [5–9].
Increasing the circulating optical power in the cavity
increases the back-action to the resonator, which is
manifested as an increase in the oscillator’s mean-square
displacement.

While cavity optomechanical systems seek to operate
in this shot-noise dominant regime in order to observe
macroscopic quantum phenomena, material impurities
limit the quality factors within systems that are me-
chanically clamped to the environment. Furthermore,
absorption of radiation limits the number of photons

that can be used to interrogate the system. Thus,
despite cryogenic temperatures, thermal dissipation is
often the dominant decoherence mechanism and places
a material limit to the sensitivity of the device [7].

Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum have
proven to be versatile platforms for studies of light-
matter interactions [10–15].
Free from mechanical
vibrations of the environment, they have been used to
investigate nonequilibrium ﬂuctuation theorems [16],
nonlinear dynamics and synchronization [17], rotational
forces [15, 19], and coupling
motion [18], ultrasmall
to internal spin degrees of freedom [20].
In the con-
text of cavity optomechanics,
levitated nanoparticles
have also been proposed for quantum ground state
cooling [13, 14, 21, 22] and for gravitational wave
detection [23, 24]. Central to all of these experiments is
the optical gradient force, which is needed to trap and
control the scrutinized nanoparticle. However, due to the
discrete nature of optical radiation, the trapping force
is itself intrinsically noisy and RPSN may inﬂuence the
motion of the trapped particle via photon recoil heating,
akin to atomic physics where it limits the temperature
of Sisyphus cooling to a few micro-Kelvins [25].

In most situations photon recoil heating is negligibly
small
for macroscopic objects, as the recoil energy
¯h2k2/(2m) scales inversely with the object’s mass. Con-
sequently, to observe this weak eﬀect, the system has to
be suﬃciently well isolated.
In particular, the photon
recoil rate has to be larger than the thermal decoherence
rate. Using active feedback to bring a nanoparticle into
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) (Pgas ∼ 10−8 mbar), however,

we signiﬁcantly reduce the heating due to residual gas
molecules and thereby ascertain for the ﬁrst time a
direct readout of the recoiling rate of photons from a
macroscopic object at room temperature. This places us
in the regime of strong measurement back-action [8].

To minimize the damping due to residual gas molecules
we perform our experiments in UHV environments. As
described in Ref.
[11], we ﬁrst trap a particle by a
strongly focused laser beam at ambient temperature and
gas pressure, and then evacuate the vacuum chamber.
We use fused silica particles with radii on the order of
R = 50 nm, a laser beam with wavelength λ = 1064 nm
and power P0 = 70 mW, and an objective of numerical
aperture NA = 0.9 for focusing. We choose a coordinate
system whose z axis coincides with the optical axis and
whose x axis deﬁnes the direction of polarization of the
incident light (c.f. Fig. 1).

For small oscillation amplitudes, the particle’s motion
along the three principal axes is decoupled and we end up
with three independent harmonic oscillators, each with
their own oscillation frequency Ω0 and damping γ, a re-
sult of the asymmetric shape of the optical potential [11].
For example, the motion along y is described by

The trapped particle’s energy changes constantly due
to interactions with its environment and the time evolu-
tion of its average energy ¯E is predicted by the Fokker-
Planck equation to be [16]

where E∞ is the average energy in the steady state (t →

terms of discrete quanta, ¯E = n ¯hΩ0, we obtain

˙n = −γ n + Γ ,

oscillation frequencies for the x and z axes are 123 kHz
and 49 kHz, respectively. The oscillator’s damping rate
can be written as γ = γth + γrad + γfb, where γth accounts
for the interaction with the background gas, γrad for
the interaction with the radiation ﬁeld, and γfb is the
damping introduced by feedback cooling. The diﬀerent

In (6)
we have written Γ as the sum of a heating rate due to
collisions with gas molecules (Γth), a heating rate due to
photon recoil kicks (Γrecoil), and a heating rate due to
noise introduced by the feedback loop (Γfb).

The surrounding gas at temperature T gives rise
to damping γth and thermal decoherence Γth =
γth kBT /¯hΩ0 . For γ > Ω0, the particle’s motion is over-
damped and the dynamics are governed by a diﬀusion
equation, as in the case of optical tweezers operated in
liquids. At gas pressures below 10 mbar, the damping to
the nanoparticle is linear in gas pressure [26]

in agreement with atomic theory [21, 29]. Note that
similar results are obtained for the displacements in x

to be identical to (11) whereas for the x direction (along
the polarization axis) it is only half as large.

Let us estimate the magnitude of Γrecoil.

For
a Gaussian beam,
fo-
cus is I0 = P0k2NA2 / 2π, where k = ω0/c. The
scattering cross-section is derived from the parti-
cle polarizability α as σscatt = |α|2k4 / 6πε2
0, where
α = 4πε0R3(n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2), n is the index of re-
fraction and R the particle’s radius. The scattered
power is then calculated as Pscatt = σscattI0.
For
the parameters used in Figs. 2 and 3 (n = 1.45,
λ = 1064 nm, P0 = 70 mW, R = 49.8 nm, NA = 0.9) we
ﬁnd Pscatt = 3.53 µW. The speciﬁc mass density of silica
is ρSiO2 = 2200 kg/m3 and the mass of the particle turns
out to be m = 1.14× 10−18 kg. Using Ω0 = 2π× 150 kHz,
Eq. (11) predicts a reheating rate of Γrecoil = 13.0 kHz.

In addition to heating, the radiation ﬁeld also leads to
radiation damping at a rate γrad, which arises from the
Doppler eﬀect [30] and can be evaluated by calculating
the back-action of the scattered ﬁeld on the motion
of the particle along the y axis. We ﬁnd a value of
γrad ∼ Pscatt/mc2. Note that in the photon dominated
regime and in the absence of
feedback cooling, the
equilibrium temperature kBT∞ = ¯hΩ0n∞ ∼ ¯hω0 is
of the order of the photon energy. This energy is
comparable to the depth of the trapping potential in our
experiments and therefore the particle is likely to escape
as it heats up without feedback control.

To experimentally verify the departure from the gas
dominated heating regime, we record the particle’s
average energy ¯E as a function of gas pressure Pgas
under constant feedback cooling. The result is shown
in Fig. 3 where we expressed the average energy in
terms of the mean occupation number n∞ = ¯E/¯hΩ0.
The ﬁgure demonstrates that as pressure is reduced
to 10−7 mbar, the gas damping attenuates linearly
with pressure, in agreement with Eq. (7). At pressures
lower than 10−7 mbar, however, the particle’s motion
is weakly inﬂuenced by interactions with the gas.
In
this regime the dynamics are primarily determined by
particle-photon interactions and the feedback loop.

ing. The Lorentzian curves correspond to the motion of a
particle with radius R = 49.8 nm along y for three diﬀerent

the particle’s motion and feedback control. As shown
in Fig. 2, by means of feedback cooling we are able
to reach mean occupation numbers of n = 62.5 ± 5,
which corresponds to a center-of-mass temperature of
Tcm = (450.5 ± 33.1)µK.

At very low pressures, Γth becomes negligibly small
and, in absence of feedback cooling, the particle’s heat-
ing is dominated by photon shot noise, i.e. the random
momentum kicks imparted by photon scattering. Photon
recoils imparted to the nanoparticle give rise to radiation
pressure back-action, that is, a disturbance of the parti-

Figure 4a shows experimentally measured reheat-
ing time-traces for two diﬀerent particles with radii
R1 = 52.7 nm and R2 = 71.6 nm. The initial occupation
number n0 for the two particles is slightly diﬀerent and
0 = 2π × 148.8 kHz
the oscillation frequencies are Ω(1)
0 = 2π × 151.2 kHz. The slope of the time-
and Ω(2)
traces directly renders the reheating rate. We obtain
Γ1 = (20.9 ± 0.2) kHz and Γ2 = (29.4 ± 0.3) kHz. By
comparison, the theoretical photon recoil rates according
to (11) are 15.5 kHz and 38.2 kHz, respectively.

0 = 30.5 mW and P (2)

We also measured the reheating rate as a function of
focal power P0. Fig. 4b shows the reheating time-traces
of a R = 68.0 nm particle measured with inferred laser
powers P (1)
0 = 80 mW. The
oscillation frequencies for the two laser powers are
0 = 2π × 100.5 kHz and Ω(2)
0 = 2π × 158.8 kHz with
Ω(1)
corresponding reheating rates Γ1 = (19.4 ± 0.1) kHz
and Γ2 = (38.0 ± 0.3) kHz. By comparison, the theo-
retical photon recoil rates are 21.5 kHz and 35.8 kHz,
respectively.
Discrepancies between measured rates
and theoretical predictions result from residual gas
heating and our use of the paraxial approximation for
the focused laser ﬁeld.

Our measurements indicate that heating due to the
shot noise of photons is the dominant dissipation mecha-
nism in our system when the feedback is inactivated. As

The

scales with the
integral of the power spectral density (c.f. Fig. 2), while
the width of the peak yields the damping γ (cid:39) γfb.
For example, the Lorentzian peak labeled with n = 63
in Fig. 2 corresponds to a center-of-mass temperature
of Tcm = (450.5 ± 33.1) µK and yields a damping of
γfb = 2π × 269.9Hz.

We perform a direct measurement of the recoil rate
in a ring up style measurement, whereby the feedback
is switched oﬀ at t = 0 and the particle is allowed to
heat up. By inactivating the feedback we eliminate the
contribution of feedback induced heating (Γfb) [28]. As
described in Ref. [16], individual reheating trajectories
represent a stochastic process and, thus, the heating rate
and temperature have to be extracted from averages over
many individual reheating trajectories. After switching-
oﬀ the feedback we follow individual reheating trajecto-
ries over time periods that are considerably shorter than
1/γ, which allows us to linearize the exponential term in
Eq. (5). We then obtain

n(t) = n0 − γ [n0 − n∞] t + .. ≈ n0 + Γrecoil t .

(12)
In the last step, we used the fact that n0 (cid:28) n∞, a
condition that is fulﬁlled in our experiments owing to
feedback cooling. Thus, we ﬁnd that the reheating is
linear in time shortly after switching oﬀ the feedback
and that the main contribution to the reheating rate is
the photon recoil rate Γrecoil. We extract Γrecoil from
our measurements and study it as a function of system
parameters, such as laser power, particle size, and gas
pressure.

shown in Fig. 4a, increasing the particle’s size heats it
up faster despite starting oﬀ with lower n, and, as shown
in Fig. 4b, reducing laser power reduces the heating rate,
both consistent with photon recoil heating described by
Eq. (11). In our experiments, decoherence due to photon
shot noise overwhelms thermal decoherence by at least
a factor of 25 in our experiments, a ratio that could
be raised by further reducing our vacuum pressure. To
the best of our knowledge, our experiments are the ﬁrst
direct measurement of the photon recoil rate from a
mesoscopic object at ambient temperatures. We ﬁnd
that for nanoscale particles Γrecoil
is approximately
10 kHz, which sets limits to ground-state cooling proto-
cols, and limits the maximum achievable quality factors
and force sensitivities.

2. HEATING DUE TO CLASSICAL NOISE

Classical noise associated with laser intensity ﬂuctuations leads to a modulation of the trapping potential.

It

modiﬁes equation (1) in the main text into

¨y + γ ˙y + Ω2

0 y[1 + (t)] =

F (t) ,

with the normalized white noise term (t), which gives rise to a heating rate of [2, 3]

Here, S is the power spectral density of the noise, (t).

Γ = π Ω2

0 S n = γ n .

(19)

(20)

The heating rate (20) due to classical intensity ﬂuctuations modiﬁes the rate equation (3) in the main text into

(21)
where we assumed no gas heating. The solution is n(t) = n∞+[n0−n∞] exp[−(γrad−γ)t] with n∞ = Γrecoil/(γrad−γ).
The linearized solution becomes

˙n = −γrad n + Γrecoil + γ n ,

n(t) = n0 + [Γrecoil + γn0] t ,

(22)
where we made use of γ (cid:29) γrad. Thus, the more the particle is cooled and the lower n0 is, the less it suﬀers from
parametric heating due to laser intensity noise. Therefore, to overcome the limitations imposed by laser intensity
ﬂuctuations we require that the reheating experiments start out from a state of low occupation number. For example,
using n0 = 100, together with the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the trapping laser of −140 dB/Hz, we obtain
γn0 = 0.22 Hz, which is negligible compared to the recoil heating rate Γrecoil ∼ 10 kHz.

with γ being the damping. The parameter ηc in Eq. (26) denotes the total detection eﬃciency, which accounts for
the photon collection eﬃciency, the splitting into separate detection paths, optical losses, and the detector’s quantum
eﬃciency [4]. It also includes the eﬃciency of translating a displacement in y direction into a phase change between
the excitation ﬁeld and the scattered ﬁeld [5]. The factor 2/5 stems from the dipolar radiation pattern and is also
present in the power spectral density of Eq. (18). This factor is identical for the particle’s displacement in z direction
but gets modiﬁed to 1/5 for the x direction (direction of polarization).

To bring the particle close to its quantum ground state we have to minimize the expression in brackets in Eq. (26).

In Fig. 5 we plot the total spectral density Sy(Ω0) as a function of scattered power Pscatt for the case of S

and for ηc = 0.0005. The blue dot on the solid curve indicates our experimental situation, that is, Pscatt = 3.53 µW.
Strategies for improved center-of-mass cooling are optimizing the detection eﬃciency ηc and using higher feedback
gains (higher γ). As an example, the dash-dotted curve in Fig. 5 shows the case for a linewidth and detection
eﬃciency that are both increased by a factor of ten.

According to Fig. 5, the backaction noise at Pscatt = 3.53 µW amounts to ˜S

y = 4.43 pm2/Hz,
which is a factor of 3.3 lower than the the experimentally measured peak amplitude of ˜S
y = 14.53 pm2/Hz. We
y − ˜S
y = 10.10 pm2/Hz. Thus,
hence conclude that the noise introduced by the feedback loop amounts to S
