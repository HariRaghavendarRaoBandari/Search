ABSTRACT
Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a revolutionary tool to investigate yet unobserved
astrophysical objects. Especially the ﬁrst stars, which are believed to be more massive
than present-day stars, might be indirectly observable via the merger of their compact
remnants. We develop a self-consistent, cosmologically representative, semi-analytical
model to simulate the formation of the ﬁrst stars and track the binary stellar evolution
of the individual systems until the coalescence of the compact remnants. We estimate
the contribution of primordial stars to the intrinsic merger rate density and to the
detection rate of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
(aLIGO). Owing to their higher masses, the remnants of primordial stars produce
strong GW signals, even if their contribution in number is relatively small. We ﬁnd
a probability of ∼ 1% that the current detection GW150914 is of primordial origin.
We estimate that aLIGO will detect roughly 1 primordial BH-BH merger per year for
the ﬁnal design sensitivity, although this rate depends sensitively on the primordial
initial mass function. Turning this around, the detection of black hole mergers with
a total binary mass of ∼ 300 M⊙ would enable us to constrain the primordial initial
mass function.

INTRODUCTION

−4 M⊙ at redshift z = 0.09+0.03

The ﬁrst detection of GWs on September 14, 2015 has
opened a completely new window to investigate astrophysi-
cal processes and phenomena, which are otherwise invisible
to observations in the electromagnetic spectrum (but see
Loeb 2016). This ﬁrst event GW150914 was the inspiral and
merger of two black holes (BHs) with masses M1 = 36+5
−4 M⊙
and M2 = 29+4
−0.04 (Abbott et al.
2016b). It was detected by the Advanced Laser Interfer-
ometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) with a
false alert probability of < 2 × 10−7 (Abbott et al. 2016b).
The local merger rate density inferred from this event is
2 − 400 yr−1Gpc−3 for all types of mergers of compact
objects and 2 − 53 yr−1Gpc−3 for BH-BH mergers only
(Abbott et al. 2016c). GW150914 also indicates that the
stochastic GW background could be higher than previously

expected and potentially measurable by the aLIGO/Virgo
detectors operating at their ﬁnal sensitivity (Abbott et al.
2016a).

The detection probability increases with the mass of the
merging BHs. The ﬁrst, so-called Population III (Pop III),
stars are believed to be more massive than present-day stars
and yield consequently more massive remnants (for reviews
see Bromm 2013; Glover 2013; Greif 2015). Due to their high
masses, Kinugawa et al. (2014) claim that a large fraction of
the possible detections (68 − 140 yr−1) originate from these
primordial stars and Dominik et al. (2013, 2015) show that
most of the binary BHs that merge at low redshift, have
actually formed in the early Universe. Hence, it is worth in-
vestigating the contribution from Pop III stars in more detail
with a self-consistent model of primordial star formation.

In this paper, we apply a semi-analytical approach to
determine the rate density and the detection rate of mergers
for aLIGO that originate from the ﬁrst stars.

2 METHODOLOGY

2.1 Self-consistent Pop III star formation

We create a cosmologically representative sample of dark
matter merger trees with the galform code based on
Parkinson et al. (2008). The merger trees start at zmax = 50
and follow Pop III star formation down to z = 6, after
which we do not expect signiﬁcant Pop III star formation
to occur. The formation of primordial stars is modelled
self-consistently, taking into account radiative and chemical
feedback. We brieﬂy review the main aspects of the model;
see Hartwig et al. (2015a,b) for details.

To form Pop III stars, a host halo has to be metal free
and its virial temperature has to be high enough to allow
for eﬃcient cooling by H2. Moreover, we check the timescale
of dynamical heating due to previous mergers and the pho-
todissociation of H2 by external Lyman-Werner radiation.
Once a dark matter halo passes these four criteria, we as-
sign individual Pop III stars to it, based on random sampling
of a logarithmically ﬂat initial mass function (IMF) in the
mass range between Mmin = 3 M⊙ and Mmax = 300 M⊙,
motivated by, e.g., Greif et al. (2011), Clark et al. (2011),
Dopcke et al. (2013). The IMF is still uncertain, and there-
fore, besides the ﬁducial model (3 − 300 M⊙), we also con-
sider a low mass (1−100 M⊙) and a high mass (10−1000 M⊙)
IMF. The total stellar mass per Pop III-forming halo is
set by the star formation eﬃciency. This parameter is cal-
ibrated to reproduce the optical depth to Thomson scat-
tering of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016 (Planck Collaboration 2015),
taking also into account the contribution by later genera-
tions of stars, based on the global cosmic star formation
history (Behroozi & Silk 2015). With this approach we pop-
ulate minihaloes with small multiples of primordial stars (see
ﬁgure 9 in Hartwig et al. 2015a).

2.2 Binary sampling and evolution

We use the results of the most detailed study of Pop III
binary systems to date by Stacy & Bromm (2013). They
performed a cosmological simulation initialized at z = 100
within a 1.4 Mpc (comoving) box. The ﬁrst ten minihaloes to
form in their computational domain were resimulated with
greater reﬁnement to examine the gas collapse and subse-
quent formation of a Pop III multiple system within each
minihalo. Employing sink particles with an accretion radius
of 20 AU to represent individual stars, their dynamics and
mass accretion was followed for a period of 5000 yr. From
this study, we adopt a binary fraction of 36%, which trans-
lates into a ∼ 50% probability for a single star to have a
binary companion. Note that other studies of Pop III star
formation might allow larger binary fractions (Clark et al.
2011; Greif et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011), but all derived
merger and detection rates scale linearly with this binary
fraction. Our results can thus readily be rescaled accord-
ingly.

The evolution of the binary system and consequently
the nature (BH or NS), the masses, and the time of co-
alescence of the two compact objects depend mainly on
the zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) characteristics, respec-
tively the semi-major axis and eccentricity of their orbit and
their masses. For the pairing of the binaries and the underly-

ing distribution of mass ratios, we apply the “ordered pair-
ing” advocated by Oh et al. (2015), since observations show
that massive binaries favour members with similar masses.
Hence, we order the primordial stars in one halo by descend-
ing mass, check probabilistically if they have a binary com-
panion, and pair the most massive with the second most
massive, the third most massive with the fourth most mas-
sive and so on. For the ZAMS eccentricity e0 of each binary
system we draw a random value from the thermal distribu-
tion p(e) de ∝ e de with emin = 0.1 and emax = 1 (Kroupa
1995; Dominik et al. 2012; Kinugawa et al. 2014). This dis-
tribution agrees qualitatively with that in Stacy & Bromm
(2013). The ZAMS semi-major axis a0 is sampled from
the distribution p(x) dx ∝ x−1/2 dx with x = log(a0/R⊙),
amin = 50 R⊙, and amax = 2 × 106 R⊙. The shape and
the lower limit are motivated by Sana et al. (2012) and
de Mink & Belczynski (2015), whereas the upper limit is
chosen in agreement with the data by Stacy & Bromm
(2013). We have veriﬁed that the speciﬁc choice of these
limits does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬁnal results.

Once we have identiﬁed the binaries and assigned their
ZAMS quantities, we use the tabulated models for stellar
binary evolution by de Mink & Belczynski (2015) to calcu-
late the masses of the compact remnants and their delay
time tdel until coalescence. The delay time is the sum of the
time to the formation of the last compact object measured
from the ZAMS, and the ensuing inspiral time, tinsp, of the
two compact objects. The latter is the dominant timescale
for Pop III remnants. We chose their model “N-m2 A.002”,
which is the best ﬁt to the properties of Pop III stars in
terms of IMF, metallicity and evolutionary channels (see
also Kinugawa et al. 2014; Belczynski et al. 2016).

The data is tabulated for stellar masses of the indi-
vidual companions of up to 150 M⊙. For higher masses,
we proceed in the following way. We ignore binaries with
one star in the mass range 140 M⊙ 6 M∗ 6 260 M⊙,
as we do not expect any compact remnants due to pair-
instability supernova (PISN) explosions (Heger & Woosley
2002). For stars above 260 M⊙, we consider tdel character-
istic of stars with 100 M⊙ 6 M∗ 6 140 M⊙, adopt the ﬁnal
black hole masses of primordial stars from Heger & Woosley
(2002), and correct the tabulated inspiral time according to
(Kinugawa et al. 2014)

tinsp ∝ m1

−1m2

−1(m1 + m2)−1,

(1)

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the binary compact
objects. This approach is justiﬁed because the tabulated tdel
show negligible dependence on stellar mass for massive stars.

2.3 Detectability

Based on the cosmologically representative, self-consistent
sampling of Pop III stars and the corresponding tdel of each
binary, we determine the intrinsic merger rate density R.
This represents the number of compact binary mergers per
unit source time and per comoving volume, and is also re-
ferred to as the rest-frame merger rate density. To estimate
the aLIGO detection rate, we calculate the single-detector
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ρ for each merger via (Maggiore
2007; Finn & Chernoﬀ 1993; Cutler & Flanagan 1994),

where h(f ) is the Fourier-domain (sky- and orientation-
averaged) GW strain at the detector, and Sn is the
spectral density of a single aLIGO de-

tector. We assume
if
ρ > 8, as conventionally done in the LIGO literature
(Abadie et al. 2010; Dominik et al. 2015; Belczynski et al.
2015; de Mink & Mandel 2016). (This translates to SNR
larger than 12 for a three-detector network, e.g. the two aLI-
GOs and advanced Virgo.) For the current aLIGO detectors,
we use the O1 noise power spectral density (Abbott et al.
2015), whereas to assess detectability when the detectors are
in their ﬁnal design conﬁgurations we use the zero-detuning,
high-power conﬁguration of Abbott et al. (2009). For h(f ),
we use either inspiral-only, restricted post-Newtonian wave-
forms (computing the Fourier transform with the sta-
tionary phase approximation, see e.g. Maggiore 2007), or
inspiral-merger-ringdown PhenomA (non-spinning) wave-
forms (Ajith et al. 2008, 2009). We employ the former for
BH-NS and NS-NS systems, with a cut-oﬀ at the frequency
of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO; note that
the ISCO frequency also corresponds approximately to the
merger frequency of NS-NS systems). For BH-BH systems,
particularly at high masses, the merger-ringdown contains
considerable SNR, hence we use PhenomA waveforms. We
then calculate the detection rate as (Haehnelt 1994)

where the luminosity distance dL and the derivative of the
look-back time with respect to z, dt/dz, are computed with
a ΛCDM cosmology, and the integral is restricted to de-
tectable events only (ρ > 8).

Finally, we characterise the stochastic GW background
of our binary population by the energy density spectrum
(see e.g. Phinney 2001; Rosado 2011; Abbott et al. 2016a):

where ρc is the critical density, and dEs/dfs ∝ (f |h(f )|)2
is the spectral energy density of a binary, computed at
the source-frame frequency fs = f (1 + z) (f being the
frequency at the detector). Our model’s prediction for
ΩGW should be compared with the 1σ power-law inte-
grated curves (Thrane & Romano 2013) that are given by
Abbott et al. (2016a) for the aLIGO/advanced Virgo net-
work in the observing runs O1 (2015-16), O2 (2016-17) and
O5 (2020-2022), and which represent the network’s sensitiv-
ity to standard cross-correlation searches (Allen & Romano
1999) of power-law backgrounds.

3 RESULTS

In Figure 1, we compare our star formation rate (SFR)
to other models. Our self-consistent Pop III SFR, with
a peak value of SFRmax = 2 × 10−4 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3, is
in compliance with Visbal et al. (2015), who show that it
cannot exceed a few ×10−4, without violating the con-
straints set by Planck Collaboration (2015). Kinugawa et al.
(2014) assume an SFR with a peak value of SFRmax =
3 × 10−3 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3, which is about an order of mag-
nitude higher than our result. The SFR is about the same

lower than the value by Kinugawa et al. (2014).

Table 1. Detection rates in events per year for aLIGO at ﬁnal de-
sign sensitivity. Assuming a log-normal distribution, we state the
statistical scatter (1σ) between diﬀerent independent realisations
in dex. For the ﬁducial IMF (3-300) we expect about one Pop III
binary black hole every two years and for the lower mass IMF (1-
100) even up to 5 detections per year. The probability to detect a
merger that can uniquely be identiﬁed as being of primordial ori-
gin (m1 > MPI) is highest for the high mass IMF (10-1000) with
about one detection per decade. Inversely, the strong dependence
of the detection rate on the IMF can be used to infer the upper
mass limit for Pop III stars.

Pop III stars by Kinugawa et al. (2014) in the regime rele-
vant for GW detections, i.e. mergers occurring at late cosmic
times. The diﬀerence is to be ascribed to the diﬀerent binary
evolution models. Given that Kinugawa et al. (2014) study
explicitly Pop III star binary evolution, and we extrapolate
models at higher metallicity, we conclude that our estimates
are a lower limit to the GW detections of Pop III binaries by
up to an order of magnitude. We stress, however, that our
Pop III SFR is calculated self-consistently and reproduces
the optical depth constraint set by Planck Collaboration
(2015), in contrast to Kinugawa et al. (2014).

Comparing models with diﬀerent IMFs, we conclude
that the number of expected mergers is dominated by Mmax.
This is because the remnants at low stellar masses are mostly
NSs, which constitute only a small contribution to the over-
all merger rate. The merger rate density generally decreases
with higher Mmax, which is mainly related to the diﬀerent
number of binary systems that can form per minihalo for the
diﬀerent IMFs. At face value, Pop III stars do not yield a
major contribution to the total merger rate density, but we
recall that our estimates are likely lower limits. Crucially,
due to their higher masses, Pop III BH-BH mergers have
strong GW signals, which boost their detection probability
over lower-mass BHs formed from later stellar generations.
Another essential question is whether we are able to
discriminate mergers of primordial origin. The most mas-
sive remnant BHs for binaries at 0.1 Z⊙ have a mass of
∼ 42 M⊙ (de Mink & Belczynski 2015). All BHs with higher
masses must be of primordial origin (though note that bi-
nary BHs with Mtot up to ∼ 160M⊙ may form in glob-
ular clusters, Rodriguez et al. 2016). The minimal mass for
Pop III remnant BHs above the PISN gap is MPI ≈ 200 M⊙.
Since aLIGO will measure the source-frame total mass for
Mtot & MPI within a 20% uncertainty at the 2-σ level
(Graﬀ et al. 2015, see also Veitch et al. 2015; Haster et al.
2016), we can use MPI as the threshold for the unambiguous
detection of a primordial BH. For IMFs extending above
300 M⊙ about one BH-BH merger per decade can be un-
ambiguously attributed to a Pop III binary (Table 1). As
discussed above, this is plausibly a lower limit.

mass range of GW150914 is indicated by the grey area. With suf-
ﬁcient detections around Mtot ≈ 300 M⊙ we could discriminate
diﬀerent Pop III IMFs based on their GW ﬁngerprint.

diﬀerent generations of stars (also below MPI) we show the
speciﬁc detection rates as a function of Mtot = m1 + m2 in
Figure 3. We compare our three diﬀerent IMFs with a model
by de Mink & Mandel (2016). They determine the detection
rate of Pop I/II stars at full design sensitivity, for the chem-
ically homogeneous evolutionary channel for binary black
hole mergers, which dominates at 30 M⊙ . Mtot . 100 M⊙.
For a given Mtot the histogram enables to determine the
probability that this event has a primordial origin. For
GW150914, this probability is ∼ 1%. For detections around
∼ 300 M⊙,
in addition to unambiguously establishing a
Pop III origin, one can even distinguish diﬀerent Pop III
IMFs by their number of detections over the next decades.
In our models, the highest stochastic GW background
is produced by BH-BH mergers, and at f ≈ 25 Hz (where
the network is most sensitive), ΩGW(25 Hz) ≈ 4 × 10−12–
1.4 × 10−10 (the range corresponds to diﬀerent IMF choices;
the inclusion or removal of resolved sources only makes a
negligible diﬀerence). For comparison, the stochastic back-
ground at 25 Hz inferred from the observation of GW150914
is ΩGW(25Hz) = 1.1+2.7
−0.9 × 10−9 at 90% conﬁdence level, and
the aLIGO/advanced Virgo network 1σ sensitivity (corre-
sponding to SNR = 1) for two years of observation at design
sensitivity (O5) is ΩGW(25Hz) = 6.6×10−10. The stochastic
background produced by Pop III compact object mergers is
therefore negligible at the relevant frequencies.

4 DISCUSSION

We have estimated the GW ﬁngerprint of Pop III remnants
on the aLIGO data-stream. GWs have the potential to di-
rectly detect the remnants of the ﬁrst stars, and possibly
even to constrain the Pop III IMF by observing BH-BH
mergers with a total mass around Mtot ≈ 300 M⊙. The
latter is the key to ascertain the impact of the ﬁrst stars,
due to their radiative and supernova feedback, on early cos-
mic evolution. The new GW window ideally complements
other probes, such as high-z searches for energetic super-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–6

novae with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), or
stellar archaeological surveys of extremely metal-poor stars
(Bromm 2013). We have developed a model which includes
Pop III star formation self-consistently, anchored, within the
uncertainties, to the Planck optical depth to Thomson scat-
tering. The main caveats in this study arise from the still
uncertain Pop III binary properties and the corresponding
stellar binary evolution.

We ﬁnd a probability of ∼ 1% that GW150914 orig-
inates from Pop III stars, although this number may in-
crease with improved future modeling. Crucially, the higher
masses of the ﬁrst stars boost their GW signal, and there-
fore their detection rate. Up to 5 detections per year with
aLIGO at ﬁnal design sensitivity originate from Pop III BH-
BH mergers. Approximately once per decade we should de-
tect a BH-BH merger that can unambiguously be identiﬁed
as a Pop III remnant. It is exciting that the imminent launch
of the JWST nearly coincides with the ﬁrst direct detection
of GWs, thus providing us with two powerful, complemen-
tary windows into the early Universe.

GWs from BH binaries originating from Pop III stars
may also be detectable by the Einstein Telescope or (in
their early inspiral) by eLISA (Amaro-Seoane & Santamar´ıa
2010; Sesana 2016), which would allow probing the physics
of these systems with unprecedented accuracy.
