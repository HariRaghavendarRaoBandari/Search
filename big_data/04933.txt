In this brief note we prove that linear B-spline copulas is not a new family of copulas since they are
equivalent to checkerboard copulas, and discuss in particular how they are used to extend empirical
subcopulas to copulas.

Abstract

Keywords: B-spline copulas, checkerboard copulas, bilinear approximation

1 Introduction

In the context of probability and statistics, copula functions are used to represent the functional relation-
ship between the joint distribution function of a random vector and its corresponding univariate marginal
distribution functions. In the 2-dimensional case, for example, if (X, Y ) is a random vector and FXY its
joint distribution function, the outstanding theorem by Sklar (1959) may be used in this particular case
to prove that there exists a 2-copula function C such that FXY (x, y) = C(FX (x), FY (y)) where FX and
FY are the marginal univariate distribution functions of X and Y, respectively. A 2-copula is a func-
tion C : I 2 → I, where I := [0, 1], such that C(u, 0) = 0 = C(0, v), C(u, 1) = u and C(1, v) = v,
and that is 2-increasing: the C-volume VC(B) ≥ 0 for any rectangle B = [u1, u2] × [v1, v2] ⊆ I 2 where
VC(B) = C(u2, v2) − C(u2, v1) − C(u1, v2) + C(u1, v1). Copulas are always uniformly continuous.

In fact, Sklar’s Theorem proves that there is a unique subcopula that links a joint distribution function
to its univariate margins, and thereafter it is proved that such unique subcopula can be extended to a
generally nonunique copula, but the copula is unique if the univariate margins are continuous, see for
example Schweizer and Sklar (1983) or Nelsen (1999). The deﬁnition of 2-subcopula is almost the same of
a copula except for the fact that its domain is a subset S1 × S2 of the unit square I 2 where {0, 1} ⊆ Si ⊆ I,
and therefore a 2-copula is a 2-subcopula whose domain is I 2.

We will prove that linear B-spline copulas as in Shen et al. (2008) is not a new family of copulas since they
are the same as the ones obtained by bilinear extension of certain type of subcopulas, deﬁned as checkerboard
copulas by Li et al. (1997) or Li et al. (1998), and discuss its application to extend empirical subcopulas to
copulas.

and Q(m2)

be two subsets of I such that Q(mk)

Let Q(m1)
= {qki : i = 0, . . . , mk} where mk ∈ {1, 2, . . .} and
0 = qk0 < qk1 < · · · < qk,mk−1 < qkmk = 1 for k ∈ {1, 2}. If C : I 2 → I is a 2-copula, then the restriction of
C to the mesh D := Q(m1)
is a subcopula which will be denoted as S. That is, for any (u, v) ∈ D
we have S(u, v) = C(u, v).

Deﬁne subsets Qij ⊆ I 2 such that Qij := hq1,i−1, q1i] × hq2,j−1, q2j] for i ∈ {1, . . . , m1} and j ∈ {1, . . . , m2},
with the convention that h is for left-open if i or j is equal to 1 and left-closed otherwise. Then Q := {Qij :
i = 1, . . . , m1 and j = 1, . . . , m2} is a partition of I 2. For any (u, v) ∈ Qij deﬁne the functions

λ1i(u) :=

u − q1,i−1
q1i − q1,i−1

λ2j(v) :=

v − q2,j−1
q2j − q2,j−1

The function CQ : I 2 → I deﬁned for each (u, v) in some Qij by

CQ(u, v)

:= [1 − λ1i(u)][1 − λ2j(v)]S(q1,i−1, q2,j−1) + [1 − λ1i(u)]λ2j(v)S(q1,i−1, q2j)

+λ1i(u)[1 − λ2j(v)]S(q1i, q2,j−1) + λ1i(u)λ2j(v)S(q1i, q2j)

is a copula that extends sucopula S to I 2 as proved, for example, by Lemma 2.3.5 in Nelsen (1999), that
may be considered as an approximation of C, and that in particular agrees with S (and therefore with C)
on D. It is straightforward to obtain the copula density associated to CQ which for each (u, v) in some Qij
is given by

(5)

where VS(Qij) is the S−volume of Qij :

cQ(u, v) =

∂2

∂u∂v

CQ(u, v) =

VS(Qij)
VΠ(Qij)

VS(Qij) = S(q1i, q2j) − S(q1,i−1, q2j) − S(q1i, q2,j−1) + S(q1,i−1, q2,j−1)

and VΠ(Qij) the Π−volume of Qij where Π(u, v) = uv, that is:

VΠ(Qij) = q1iq2j − q1,i−1q2j − q1iq2,j−1 + q1,i−1q2,j−1 = (q1i − q1,i−1)(q2j − q2,j−1)

It should be noticed that since S is the restriction of C to D then VS(Qij) = VC(Qij).

Now consider the particular case where m1 = m2 = m ∈ {1, 2, . . .} and Q(m) = {i/m : i = 0, 1, . . . , m}. If a
subcopula S is the restriction of a copula C to the mesh D = Q(m) × Q(m) then the extension of subcopula S
to a copula CQ as in (2) is called a checkerboard copula approximation of C, which in fact approximates C
uniformly, see Li et al. (1997) or Li et al. (1998). For this particular case we obtain the following expression
for the checkerboard copula density, where 1Qij is the indicator function of Qij = h i−1

and proved that CLB is a copula that uniformly approximates C. It is straightforward to notice that the
copula density for CLB is the same as (6):

cLB(u, v) =

CLB(u, v) = m2

(8)

and therefore the linear B-spline copula approximation is the same as the checkerboard copula approximation
for any given copula. This proves that the claim in Shen et al.(2008) that linear B-spline copulas is a new
family of copulas is false.

3 Empirical 2-subcopula and extensions

Let {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)} denote an observed bivariate sample of size n from a continuous distribution. In
Nelsen (1999) it is deﬁned as empirical copula the function Cn given by

Cn(cid:18) i

n

n (cid:19) :=

n

Xk = 1

1{rank(xk) ≤ i , rank(yk) ≤ j} ,

i, j ∈ {0, . . . , n}

(9)

Strictly speaking, what is usually known as empirical copula is not a copula, it is a subcopula with domain
the mesh D = {i/n : i = 0, 1, . . . , n}2, which of course can be extended to a checkerboard copula as explained
in the previous section. So what Shen et al.(2008) deﬁne as empirical linear B-spline copula is in fact a
checkerboard copula extension of the empirical (sub)copula given in (9), and such authors redeﬁne “empirical
copula” as a discontinuous extension of (9) by a function ˆCE : I 2 → I given by

ˆCE(u, v) = (cid:26) Cn(cid:0) i−1

n , j−1
n (cid:1),

1,

i−1
n ≤ u < i
u = v = 1,

n , j−1

n ≤ v < j
n ,

but being discontinuous ˆCE clearly is not a copula, in contrast with the checkerboard approximation which
extends (9) to a copula. Therefore, the comparison of nonparametric estimation of copulas performed by
Shen et al.(2008) between the empirical linear B-spline copula and their deﬁnition of empirical copula is, in
fact, a comparison of the checkerboard copula extension of (9) versus a discontinuous noncopula extension
of (9).

4 Final remarks

This note was submitted for publication to Computational Statistics & Data Analysis and received the
following response from the reviewer:

The manuscript correctly states that linear B-spline copulas as in Shen et al. (2008) are the same
as the ones obtained by bilinear extension of certain type of subcopulas, deﬁned as checkerboard
copulas by Li et al. (1997). It was a pity that the 2008 paper did not explicitly state this link,
however, nowadays, there have been various papers that have discussed checkerboard copulas,
clariﬁed possible links with the literature, studied possible applications to empirical copulas. To
cite a few of them, please see:

I do not think the present short note adds more insights into the problem and, hence, I do not
think it is suitable for publication.

As anyone can check in detail, all of the above citations have no reference to Shen et al.(2008) nor a
mention about the equivalence between checkerboard copulas and linear B-spline copulas. Moreover, a
recently published authoritative book on copula theory by Durante and Sempi (2016) which includes a
section on checkerboard copulas does not mention its equivalence to linear B-spline copulas, not even in
the historical remarks about the subject, which by the way it does include the above reviewer’s citations.
Finally, in the recently published and also authoritative book on copula modeling by Joe (2015) bivariate
linear B-spline copulas and citation of Shen et al.(2008) is included as a non-parametric estimation method of
low-dimensional copulas, but no mention at all about its equivalence with checkerboard copulas. Therefore,
it is a pity that a prestigious journal such as Computational Statistics & Data Analysis refuses to publish
a note which their reviewers accept is correct about a published article that included a false claim about a
new class of copulas.
