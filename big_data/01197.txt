ABSTRACT

Context. Dust formation is thought to play an important role in the mass loss from stars at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB);
however, where and how dust forms is still open to debate.
Aims. We present visible polarimetric imaging observations of the well-studied AGB star W Hya taken with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL
as well as high spectral resolution long-baseline interferometric observations taken with the AMBER instrument at the Very Large
Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Our goal is to spatially resolve the dust and molecule formation region within a few stellar radii.
Methods. We observed W Hya with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL at three wavelengths in the continuum (645, 748, and 820 nm), in the
Hα line at 656.3 nm, and in the TiO band at 717 nm. The VLTI/AMBER observations were carried out in the wavelength region of
the CO ﬁrst overtone lines near 2.3 µm with a spectral resolution of 12000.
Results. Taking advantage of the polarimetric imaging capability of SPHERE-ZIMPOL combined with the superb adaptive optics
performance, we succeeded in spatially resolving three clumpy dust clouds located at ∼50 mas (∼2 R(cid:63)) from the central star, revealing
dust formation very close to the star. The AMBER data in the individual CO lines suggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to
∼3 R(cid:63). Furthermore, the SPHERE-ZIMPOL image taken over the Hα line shows emission with a radius of up to ∼160 mas (∼7 R(cid:63)).
We found that dust, molecular gas, and Hα-emitting hot gas coexist within 2–3 R(cid:63). Our modeling suggests that the observed polarized
intensity maps can reasonably be explained by large (0.4–0.5 µm) grains of Al2O3, Mg2SiO4, or MgSiO3 in an optically thin shell
(τ550nm = 0.1 ± 0.02) with an inner and outer boundary radius of 1.9–2.0 R(cid:63) and 3 ± 0.5 R(cid:63), respectively. The observed clumpy
structure can be reproduced by a density enhancement of a factor of 4 ± 1.
Conclusions. The grain size derived from our modeling of the SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric images is consistent with the predic-
tion of the hydrodynamical models for the mass loss driven by the scattering due to micron-sized grains. The detection of the clumpy
dust clouds close to the star lends support to the dust formation induced by pulsation and large convective cells as predicted by the
3-D simulations for AGB stars.

1. Introduction

Low- and intermediate-mass stars experience signiﬁcant mass
loss at late stages of their evolution, particularly on the asymp-
totic giant branch (AGB). It is often argued that the levitation
of the atmosphere by the large-amplitude stellar pulsation leads
to dust formation, and the radiation pressure that the dust grains
receive by absorbing stellar photons can initiate mass outﬂows.
However, in the case of oxygen-rich AGB stars, the hydrody-
namical simulations of Woitke (2006) and H¨ofner (2007) show
that the radiation pressure on dust grains caused by the absorp-
tion of stellar photons is not suﬃcient to drive the mass loss
with the mass-loss rates observed in these stars. The reason is
that the iron-rich silicate, which eﬃciently absorbs stellar pho-
tons in the visible and near-IR and is therefore crucial for driv-
ing the mass loss, cannot exist in the vicinity of the star because
the dust temperature exceeds the sublimation temperature. On

the other hand, Al2O3 and the iron-poor silicate can exist much
closer to the star because their opacity in the visible and near-IR
is low. However, and exactly for this reason, it does not absorb
stellar photons suﬃciently to drive mass outﬂows. To solve this
problem, H¨ofner (2008) proposes that the radiation pressure on
micron-sized iron-free silicate grains due to scattering—and not
to absorption—can drive outﬂows in oxygen-rich AGB stars.

High angular resolution observations have been revealing the
presence of dust in the vicinity of the central star. The visible in-
terferometric observations of Miras and semi-regular variables
by Ireland et al. (2004) show an increase in the angular size to-
ward shorter wavelengths, which is attributed to the increase in
scattered light by dust in the inner circumstellar envelope. The
long-baseline polarimetric interferometry of the Mira stars R Car
and RR Sco carried out by Ireland et al. (2005) suggests the pres-
ence of transparent grains within 3 R(cid:63). More recently, Norris et
al. (2012) have carried out polarimetric interferometry at 1.04–
2.06 µm for three AGB stars (including W Hya presented in this
paper) using the the aperture-masking technique with the NACO
instrument of VLT. They measured the visibilities (i.e., ampli-
tude of the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution of the
object) in two perpendicular polarization directions. Because the

1

Ohnaka et al.: Clumpy dust formation and molecular outer atmosphere of the AGB star W Hya

visibility is sensitive to the size and shape of the object, the ra-
tio of the visibilities measured in two polarization directions al-
lowed them to detect scattered light from a dust shell very close
to the star at 1.6–2 R(cid:63). Furthermore, they derived a grain size of
∼0.3 µm, in agreement with the theory of H¨ofner (2008). Norris
et al. (2012) suggest that iron-free silicates such as forsterite
(Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) or corundum (Al2O3) should
be responsible for the scattering. The mid-IR interferometric ob-
servations of the semi-regular M giant RT Vir with the MIDI
instrument at VLTI also lend support to the presence of iron-free
silicate between 2 and 3 R(cid:63) (Sacuto et al. 2013).

The red giant W Hya is one of the well-studied oxygen-rich
AGB stars. Thanks to its brightness and proximity (78+6.5−5.6 pc,
Knapp et al. 2003), it has been studied with various observational
techniques from the visible to the radio. While it is classiﬁed as a
semi-regular variable with spectral types of M7.5–9 on Simbad,
its light curve shows clear periodicity (e.g., Woodruﬀ et al. 2008)
with a period of 389 days (Uttenthaler et al. 2011), although the
variability amplitude of ∆V ≈ 3 is noticeably smaller than that
of typical Mira stars. Therefore, it is often treated as a Mira star
in the literature (see Uttenthaler et al. 2011 for a discussion of
the classiﬁcation).

Infrared interferometric observations of W Hya reveal an
extended atmosphere. The uniform-disk diameter derived be-
tween 1.1 and 3.8 µm by Woodruﬀ et al. (2008, 2009) shows
that the angular size in the wavelength regions relatively free of
H2O bands is 30–38 mas, while the angular size increases up to
∼70 mas in the H2O bands, suggesting the presence of an H2O
shell. The mid-IR interferometric observations of Zhao-Geisler
et al. (2011) with VLTI/MIDI show that the angular diameter is
75–80 mas at 8–10 µm and increases to 100–105 mas from 10
to 13 µm. These authors interpret that the angular diameters at
8–10 µm represent the size of the H2O shell, while the increase
in the angular diameter longward of 10 µm can be attributed to
the dust envelope.

Khouri et al. (2015) present a detailed modeling of the dust
envelope of W Hya using the spectral energy distribution (SED)
and the dust spectral features observed from the near-IR to the
sub-mm domain, as well as the aforementioned high spatial res-
olution observations of Norris et al. (2012) and Zhao-Geisler et
al. (2011). The Khouri et al. model consists of a gravitationally
bound shell of large (0.3 µm) grains of Al2O3 or Mg2SiO4 be-
tween 1.7 and 2.0 R(cid:63) and an outer amorphous silicate shell with
an inner radius of >25 R(cid:63). They derived a current dust mass-
loss rate of 4 × 10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1 and suggest that there has been
a change in the mass-loss rate of a factor of 2–3 within the last
4500 years.

In this paper, we present visible polarimetric imaging obser-
vations of W Hya with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL instrument
as well as high spatial and high spectral resolution near-IR inter-
ferometric observations with the VLTI/AMBER instrument. Our
goal is to probe the dust and molecular gas close to the central
star.

2. Observations
2.1. SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric imaging observations
VLT/SPHERE is a high spatial resolution and high contrast
imaging instrument mounted on the Unit Telescope (UT) 3; it
is equipped with an extreme adaptive optics (AO) system for
0.55 to 2.32 µm (Beuzit et al. 2008). The ZIMPOL instrument
is a module for nearly diﬀraction-limited polarimetric imaging
(as well as classical, non-polarimetric imaging) at 550–900 nm

2

(Thalmann et al. 2008). Our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations of
W Hya (Program ID: 095.D-0397, P.I.: K. Ohnaka) took place
on 2015 July 08 (UTC) in P2 mode, in which the ﬁeld orien-
tation remained ﬁxed. The K3III star HD121653 (V = 7.2) was
observed as a reference of the point spread function (PSF). The
angular diameter of HD121653 is 0.789 ± 0.022 mas (CalVin
database1), which appears as a point source with the spatial res-
olution of SPHERE-ZIMPOL. The V magnitude of W Hya at
the time of our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations is estimated
to be ∼7, corresponding to phase 0.9 (pre-maximum light) of
the light curve of the American Association of Variable Star
Observers (AAVSO). The summary of our SPHERE-ZIMPOL
observations is given in Table 1.

We used ﬁve ﬁlters: CntHa (central wavelength λc =
644.9 nm, FWHM = 4.1 nm), NHa (λc = 656.34 nm, FWHM =
0.97 nm), TiO717 (λc = 716.8 nm, FWHM = 19.7 nm), Cnt748
(λc = 747.4 nm, FWHM = 20.6 nm), and Cnt820 (λc = 817.3 nm,
FWHM = 19.8 nm). Figure 1 shows the high resolution spec-
trum of W Hya obtained by Uttenthaler et al. (2011) at nearly
the same variability phase as our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observa-
tions (photometric calibration of the spectrum carried out as de-
scribed below). The visible spectrum of W Hya is dominated
by the prominent TiO bands. As the ﬁgure shows, three ﬁlters,
CntHa, Cnt748, and Cnt820, sample the (pseudo-)continuum re-
gions that are relatively free of TiO bands. The TiO717 ﬁlter
samples the wavelength region of the TiO band. The NHa ﬁlter
covers the wavelength region of the Hα line, as shown in the
inset.

The SPHERE-ZIMPOL instrument, which is equipped with
two cameras (cam1 and cam2), enables us to observe a given
target with the same or diﬀerent ﬁlters simultaneously. We
observed W Hya by using the ﬁlter pairs of (CntHa, NHa),
(TiO717, Cnt748), and (Cnt820, Cnt820) for cam1 and cam2.
For the observations of W Hya with the Cnt820 ﬁlter, the neu-
tral density ﬁlter ND1 was inserted in the path common to cam1
and cam2. The pixel scale of the two cameras is 3.628 mas. For
each target and with each ﬁlter pair, we took Nexp exposures for
each of the Stokes Q+, Q−, U+, and U− components, with NDIT
frames in each exposure. We repeated this procedure at three dif-
ferent dithering positions.

The SPHERE instrument records the H-band Strehl ratios in
separate FITS ﬁles2. As listed in Table 1, the median H-band
Strehl ratio during the observations of W Hya was 0.79–0.88,
which corresponds to Strehl ratios of 0.37–0.51 at the wave-
lengths of the ZIMPOL observations, if we assume that the Fried
parameter is proportional to λ6/5. However, the median Strehl ra-
tio during the observations of the PSF reference HD121653 was
signiﬁcantly lower: 0.56–0.59 in the H band. The Strehl ratios
in the visible derived from the observed images of HD121653
are 0.030–0.082 at the wavelengths of the ZIMPOL observa-
tions, which are 5–12 times lower than those for W Hya. The
reason for the lower Strehl ratios for the PSF reference is likely
the worse seeing during the observations of HD121653 than for
W Hya. Because of this signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the AO perfor-
mance between W Hya and the PSF reference, we did not de-
convolve the images of W Hya.

We reduced the raw data using the SPHERE pipeline ver-
sion 0.15.0-23. Each exposure was processed with the reduction
pipeline, which produces the image of the Q+ or Q− or U+ or U−

Fig. 1. High resolution visible spectrum of
W Hya. The spectrum is based on the data ob-
tained by Uttenthaler et al. (2011), and we ap-
plied the ﬂux calibration to their spectrum as
described in Sect. 2.1. The FWHMs of ﬁve ﬁl-
ters used in our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observa-
tions are marked with the horizontal bars. The
insets show enlarged views of the spectral re-
gion of the CntHa and NHa ﬁlters. The arrow
in the lower inset marks the position of the Hα
line.

The ﬂux of our PSF reference star HD121653 with the ﬁlters
used in our observations is not known, which means that we can-
not use this star for the ﬂux calibration of the SPHERE-ZIMPOL
intensity maps of W Hya. Therefore, we carried out the ﬂux cal-
ibration of the intensity maps using the high resolution visible
spectrum of W Hya presented in Uttenthaler et al. (2011), which
was obtained approximately at the same variability phase (al-
though in a diﬀerent variability cycle). We ﬁrst scaled the spec-
trum so that the ﬂux obtained with the V-band ﬁlter matches the
V magnitude of 7 at the time of our SPHERE observations es-
timated from the AAVSO light curve. From this ﬂux-calibrated
visible spectrum of W Hya, we computed the ﬂux for each ﬁl-
ter used in our observations. We approximated the transmission
curves of the ﬁlters with a top-hat function speciﬁed with the
central wavelength and FWHM. The resulting ﬂuxes with ﬁve
ﬁlters are given in Table 2. The SPHERE-ZIMPOL intensity
maps were scaled so that the ﬂux integrated within a radius
of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 matches these ﬂuxes. We chose this radius, because we
needed to set the radius to be as large as possible to include the
whole detected ﬂux and still stay within the detector.

The orientation of the images was set so that north is up and east

by M. van den Ancker in the User Support Department of ESO:
the images on cam1 were up-down ﬂipped, while those on cam2
were rotated by 180◦. Since the position angle of the y-axis of
the detector is 357.95◦± 0.55◦, the images (both cam1 and cam2)
were rotated clockwise by 2.05◦.

2.2. High spectral resolution VLTI/AMBER observations

The near-IR VLTI instrument AMBER (Petrov et al. 2007),
which operates at 1.3–2.4 µm, combines three UTs or 1.8 m
Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) and allows us to achieve a spatial
resolution of 3 mas (at 2 µm) with the current maximum baseline
of 140 m. The AMBER instrument is equipped with three spec-
tral resolutions, 35, 1500, and 12000. With the highest spectral
resolution of 12000, it is possible to resolve individual atomic
and molecular lines. The interferometric observables measured
with AMBER are visibility, closure phase (CP), and diﬀerential
phase (DP). Visibility is the amplitude of the Fourier transform
of the object’s intensity distribution on the sky and contains in-
formation about the size and shape of the object. The CP is the
sum of the Fourier phases on three baselines around a triangle
formed by three telescopes. Deviations of CP from 0 or 180◦ in-
dicate asymmetry of the object. The DP represents the photocen-
ter shift in spectral features with respect to the continuum. The
AMBER instrument also records the spectrum of the same wave-
length region simultaneously with the interferometric fringes.

We observed W Hya with VLTI/AMBER on 2014 April 22
(UTC) using the AT conﬁguration A1-B2-C1, which covered
projected baseline lengths from 7.0 to 13.3 m (Program ID:
093.D-0468, P.I.: K. Ohnaka). A summary of our AMBER ob-
servations is given in Table 3. The data taken at projected base-
lines shorter than 13.3 m correspond to the ﬁrst visibility lobe
of W Hya in the continuum (see Fig. 5c). Therefore, these data
are appropriate for obtaining approximate sizes of the star and
the extended atmosphere. The data with the projected baseline
lengths shorter than the UT aperture of 8 m can be obtained

4

with AO instruments, by speckle interferometry, or by aperture-
masking and, if taken simultaneously, would be complemen-
tary to our AMBER data. However, with the absence of such
single-dish data, the AMBER data points with projected base-
lines shorter than 8 m are important for constraining the size of
the star. The variability phase at the time of our AMBER ob-
servations is estimated to be 0.77 from the AAVSO light curve
(but in a diﬀerent variability cycle). This is relatively close to the
phase at the time of our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations and al-
lows us to measure the size of the dust shell in terms of the stellar
radius. The wavelength region between 2.28 and 2.31 µm near
the CO ﬁrst overtone 2–0 band head was observed with the spec-
tral resolution of 12000. Thanks to the high brightness of W Hya
(K ≈ −3, estimated from the K-band light curve of Whitelock et
al. 2000), it was possible to achieve reasonable fringe S/N with-
out the fringe tracker FINITO (W Hya saturates FINITO in the
H band). We observed α Cen A (G2V, K = −1.5, uniform-disk
diameter = 8.314±0.016 mas, Kervella et al. 2003) and Canopus
(α Car, F0II) as an interferometric and spectroscopic calibrator,
respectively.

The recorded fringes were processed with the amdlib ver-
sion 3.0.84, which is based on the P2VM algorithm (Tatulli et al.
2007; Chelli et al. 2009). Details of the reduction are described
in Ohnaka et al. (2009, 2011, and 2013). We checked for a sys-
tematic diﬀerence in the calibrated visibilities, CPs, and DPs by
selecting the best 20% and 80% frames in terms of the fringe
S/N. Since we did not detect any noticeable diﬀerence in the re-
sults, we took the best 80% of the frames, because the errors are
smaller. The wavelength calibration and the spectroscopic cal-
ibration of the W Hya data were carried out with the method
described in Ohnaka et al. (2009).

ﬁlters, together with the intensity of the PSF reference star
HD121653. The intensity maps of W Hya (ﬁrst column of the
ﬁgure) are noticeably more extended than the PSF reference im-
ages (fourth column of the ﬁgure), which means that the circum-
stellar envelope has been spatially resolved. This is clearly seen
in the azimuthally averaged 1-D intensity proﬁles of W Hya and
HD121653, which are plotted in Fig. 3a. The 2-D Gaussian ﬁt
to the observed images of HD121653 results in PSF FWHMs of
25× 28 mas at 645 nm and 656.3 nm, 23× 28 mas at 717 nm and
748 nm, and 24 × 30 mas at 820 nm.

The FWHM of the intensity distribution of W Hya at 645,
656.3, 717, and 820 nm is 53, 51, 58, and 46 mas, respectively.
We note that the central region (within a radius of <∼20 mas) of
the image at 748 nm is saturated, which makes is impossible to
measure the FWHM (and also means that the ﬂux calibration
of the Cnt748 image is unreliable). Haniﬀ et al. (1995) mea-
sured a Gaussian FWHM of 53.6 mas at 710 nm (ﬁlter FWHM =
10 nm). Ireland et al. (2004) measured the angular size of W Hya
from 680 to 940 nm, and their FWHMs at the wavelengths of
our observations are 75 mas (717 nm) and 42 mas (820 nm).
The FWHM of our SPHERE-ZIMPOL image at 717 nm agrees
with the result of Haniﬀ et al. (1995), but is much smaller than
that measured by Ireland et al. (2004). The FWHMs measured
at 820 nm by Ireland et al. (2004) agree with our values. We
note that the observations of Ireland et al. (2004) were carried
out at phase 0.44 (near minimum light), while our observations
and the observations of Haniﬀ et al. (1995) took place near max-
imum light, at phase 0.9 and 0.04, respectively. The angular size
measurements of W Hya from 1.1 to 3.8 µm by Woodruﬀ et al.
(2009) show that the star appears smaller near maximum light
than at minimum light. Therefore, the larger size measured by
Ireland et al. (2004) than the present work or Haniﬀ et al. (1995)
may be due to the diﬀerence in the variability phase at the time
of the observations.

While the intensity maps only show the global extended
structure of the circumstellar envelope, the polarized intensity
maps IP (second column in Fig. 2) reveal more detailed, clumpy
structures of the innermost region of the envelope. We detected a
large, bright clump in the north of the central star, another large
clump in the SE, and a smaller clump in the SW. These clumps
form an incomplete shell with a radius of ∼50 mas. Moreover,
as described in Sect. 3.2, the angular diameter of the central
star measured in the continuum with AMBER is 46.6 mas. This
means that the peak of the dust clumps is found at ∼2 R(cid:63), and
most of the clumps are located within ∼3 R(cid:63) of the center of the
star. In general, the polarized intensity represents the map of the

optical depth, which is proportional to the column density of the
scattering dust grains in an optically thin case (as presented in
Sect. 4, this is the case for W Hya). Therefore, the obtained IP
maps indeed reveal clumpy dust formation very close to the star,
at ∼2 R(cid:63). We note that since the saturation in the Cnt748 inten-
sity map is limited to the central region with a radius of ∼20 mas,
it does not aﬀect the clumpy features in the IP map with Cnt748.
The radius of the dust formation region directly imaged in our
SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric imaging is consistent with the
results of the polarimetric interferometric observations of Norris
et al. (2012) and the modeling of 11.5 µm interferometric data
of Wishnow et al. (2010).

Clumpy dust clouds are detected in other nearby AGB stars
as well. For example, clumpy dust clouds have been imaged in
the innermost circumstellar envelope of the well-studied carbon-
rich AGB stars IRC+10216 (Weigelt et al. 1998; Haniﬀ &
Buscher 1998; Stewart et al. 2016 and references therein) and
CIT6 (Monnier et al. 2000). Therefore, the formation of clumpy
structures might be intrinsic to the mass loss phenomenon in
AGB stars.

The errors in the polarized intensity (and in the degree of
linear polarization as described below) were estimated using the
output of the SPHERE pipeline. The relative errors in the polar-
ized intensity are 3–5% at 645 nm, 4–8% at 656.3 nm, and ∼2%
at 717, 748, and 820 nm. In the region with very low polarized
intensity near the center, which appears in dark blue between the
clumps in the IP maps in Fig. 2, the relative errors amount to 50–
60% at 645 and 656.3 nm, 40% at 717 nm, and 30% at 820 nm
(since the central region of the IP map at 748 nm is aﬀected by
the aforementioned saturation issue, we excluded it from the er-
ror estimate of the central region).

The third column of Fig. 2 shows the maps of the degree
of linear polarization at ﬁve wavelengths, with the polarization
vector maps overlaid. The polarization vector maps, which show
a concentric pattern, conﬁrm the shell-like distribution of the
clumps. The degree of linear polarization decreases slightly with
wavelength: the maximum at 645, 656.3, 717, 748, and 820 nm
is 13%, 12%, 10%, 9%, and 8%, respectively. The absolute er-
rors in the degree of linear polarization in the clumps are 0.5%
at 645 nm (i.e., pL = 13 ± 0.5%), 0.7% at 656.3 nm, 0.1% at
717 and 748 nm, and 0.2% at 820 nm. In the central region with
very low degree of polarization, the absolute errors in pL are
0.1–0.2% at 645 and 656.3 nm, 0.03% at 717 nm, 0.04–0.07%
at 820 nm.

by Vlemmings et al. (2011) shows that the redshifted and

blueshifted components are oﬀset by 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)29 in the N-S direction,
which the authors interpret as a bipolar outﬂow or a rotating disk.
However, there is no signature of a bipolar outﬂow or a rotating
disk in the SPHERE-ZIMPOL data probably because the dust
formation close to the star is driven by large convective cells (see
Sect. 5), which may mask the signatures of a bipolar structure or
a rotating disk.

3.1.2. Extended Hα emission

The intensity map taken with the NHa ﬁlter including the Hα line
(Fig. 2, ﬁrst column, second row) appears to be more extended
than the image taken with the CntHa ﬁlter sampling the nearby
continuum (Fig. 2, ﬁrst column, ﬁrst row). In order to examine
the presence of the Hα emission, we subtracted the CntHa image
from the NHa image and both images were ﬂux-calibrated as de-
scribed in Sect. 2.1. Because the observations with the NHa and
CntHa ﬁlters were carried out simultaneously, the performance
of AO was the same for both ﬁlters. The continuum-subtracted
Hα image shown in Fig. 3b reveals emission with a radius of
∼100 mas (∼4 R(cid:63)); the emission in the south extends up to
∼160 mas (∼7 R(cid:63)).

The extended Hα emission of W Hya is similar to the Hα
envelope of the red supergiant Betelgeuse extending up to 5 R(cid:63)
imaged by Hebden et al. (1987) and more recently by Kervella

et al. (2016). While the extended Hα emission in Betelgeuse is
thought to originate in the hot chromosphere, the Hα emission in
Mira stars is associated with shocks induced by large amplitude
stellar pulsation (e.g., Gillet et al. 1983, 1985). Our Hα image
of W Hya reveals the propagation of shocks as far as 4–7 R(cid:63).
The presence of such extended Hα emission may not appear to
be consistent with the weak Hα absorption seen in the visible
spectrum shown in Fig. 1. However, this weak absorption can
be interpreted as a result of the absorption being ﬁlled in by the
extended emission.

3.2. AMBER observations of the central star and molecular

outer atmosphere

Figure 4 shows the visibilities, diﬀerential phases, and closure
phase of W Hya observed with VLTI/AMBER from 2.28 to
2.31 µm (data set #5). In addition to the CO ﬁrst overtone lines,
a number of lines are present shortward of the CO band head at
2.2935 µm. They are mostly H2O and CN lines (e.g., Wallace
& Hinkle 1996). To obtain an approximate angular size of the
star as a function of wavelength, we ﬁtted the observed visibili-
ties with a power-law-type limb-darkened disk (Hestroﬀer et al.
1997) in which the intensity is described as I = [1 − (p/R)2]α/2,
where p, R, and α are the impact parameter, limb-darkened disk

radius, and the limb-darkening parameter (α = 0 corresponds to
a uniform disk).

Figure 5a shows the obtained limb-darkened disk diameter
as a function of wavelength. On the one hand, the limb-darkened
disk angular diameter is 46.6± 0.1 mas in the continuum and in-
creases up to 230 mas in the CO lines. On the other hand, as
Fig. 5b shows, the limb-darkening parameter α is modest in the
continuum (2.1 ± 0.2; average and standard deviation over the
continuum wavelengths), but much larger in the CO lines (20–
40), suggesting signiﬁcantly stronger limb-darkening in the CO
lines. In Fig. 5d, we plot the limb-darkened disk intensity pro-
ﬁles at three representative wavelengths in the continuum, CO
line, and CO band head. The limb-darkening is already remark-
able in the continuum and so strong in the CO lines that it leads
to Gaussian-like intensity proﬁles.

To better visualize the geometrical extension of the star in
the continuum and in the lines, we generated a 2-D spectrum as
follows. First, the limb-darkened disk intensity proﬁle at each
wavelength is normalized so that the ﬂux integrated over the
stellar disk is equal to the observed ﬂux at the corresponding
wavelength. Then, the limb-darkened disk intensity proﬁles are
color-coded and placed side by side. The resulting 2-D spectrum
(Fig. 6) reveals that the star shows a halo extending to a radius
of ∼70 mas (∼3 R(cid:63)) in the CO lines and to ∼35 mas (∼1.5 R(cid:63))
in the weak H2O lines.

Figure 5c shows the ﬁt to the visibilities at three wavelengths
(continuum, CO bandhead, and CO line). The ﬁgure suggests
that while the limb-darkened disk provides an approximate pic-
ture of the star’s intensity proﬁle, there are noticeable deviations
from the limb-darkened disk. The reduced χ2 values range from
2 to 100 with a median of 33.2 for the wavelengths covered
by our observations. This means that the star is more complex
than a symmetric limb-darkened disk, possibly with inhomo-
geneities. The detection of non-zero/non-180◦ DPs and CPs (see
Figs. 4e–4h) conﬁrms the presence of such complex structures.
This makes W Hya a good target for future aperture-synthesis
imaging.

3.3. Coexistence of dust, CO gas, radio photosphere, SiO

masers, and Hα-emitting hot gas

The extended atmosphere seen in the CO lines overlap with
the location of clumpy dust clouds detected with SPHERE-
ZIMPOL. Figure 7 shows the polarized intensity observed at
645 nm in color scale with the Hα emission represented in
the contours. The geometrical extension of the atmosphere of
∼70 mas (∼3 R(cid:63)), which is marked with the outer (yellow) cir-
cle in the ﬁgure, encompasses the extension of most of the dust
clumps. The hot gas associated with the shocks traced with the

spectrum is shown in yellow at the bottom.

Hα emission extends up to ∼7 R(cid:63) and overlaps the distribution
of the dust and CO gas.

Reid & Menten (2007) obtained an image of W Hya in the
43 GHz radio continuum with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array. The star shows extended emission—the so-called radio
photosphere (Reid & Menten 1997)—that is 69 × 46 mas in size
with the major axis lying nearly in the E-W direction. The size
of the radio photosphere (blue ellipse in Fig. 7) is much smaller
than the extension of the atmosphere seen in the 2.3 µm CO lines.
The variability phase of the radio observations of Reid & Menten
(2007) was 0.25, diﬀerent from the phase of our AMBER obser-
vations. While this diﬀerence in the variability phase should be
kept in mind, we also note that the temperature derived from
the radio observations is rather high, 2380 ± 550 K. Therefore,
the radio continuum at 43 GHz may sample the innermost re-
gion of the extended atmosphere. The SiO  = 1, J = 1 − 0
masers imaged by Reid & Menten (2007) form an incomplete
shell with a radius of 41 mas (middle black circle), coexisting
with the CO gas and dust. These multi-wavelength observations
suggest the complex, multicomponent nature of the outer atmo-
sphere of W Hya.

4. Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of the

polarized intensity maps

The SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric images provide valuable
constraints on the properties of the innermost dust envelope, par-
ticularly, the grain size. For this purpose, we used our Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code mcmpi sim (Ohnaka et al. 2006),
which was also used for the interpretation of polarimetric imag-
ing data (Murakawa et al. 2008). The change of the Stokes vec-
tor is treated with the scattering matrix (see, e.g., Wolf et al.
1999; Gordon et al. 2001), whose elements are computed from
the complex refractive index of a given grain species. The output
of our Monte Carlo code is the intensity (I) and the Stokes Q and
U images. To compare these data with the observed values, we
ﬁrst convolved the model Q and U images, and also the intensity
I with the observed PSF from the PSF reference star, and then
computed the maps of the polarized intensity and the degree of
linear polarization from the convolved Q, U, and I images. We
adopted this approach instead of convolving the model IP and

Fig. 7. Overlay of the distribution of dust (polarized intensity

and the molecular gas (extension of the atmosphere derived from
the AMBER data in the CO lines, outer yellow circle). The in-
ner white circle represents the size of the star derived from the
AMBER data in the continuum. The blue ellipse and the middle
black circle represent the size of the radio photosphere and the
SiO maser shell measured at 43 GHz by Reid & Menten (2007),
respectively. The contours are plotted in logarithmic scale. The

pL maps because it corresponds to how the IP and pL maps were
obtained from the observational data.

However, as Fig. 3a shows, the 1-D intensity proﬁle of our
PSF reference star HD121653 shows a halo that is more ex-
tended than that of W Hya at intensity levels lower than 1% of

the central peak (at angular distances greater than 120 mas), al-
though HD121653 should appear as a point source. This means
that the performance of AO was much worse for HD121653 than
for W Hya due to the worse seeing (see in Sect. 2.1). If we con-
volve the model I images with the PSF from HD121653, this
extended halo in the PSF—despite its low intensity—makes the
convolved I images much more extended than it should be with
the true, narrower PSF for W Hya. When the convolved I im-
ages are too extended, the predicted degree of polarization is
signiﬁcantly lower because of the division with I in pL = IP/I,
which makes a comparison with the observed data impossible.
However, we found out that the polarized intensity maps nor-
malized with the peak value at each wavelength are not very
sensitive to the extended halo of the observed PSF. Therefore,
we used the normalized polarized intensity maps to constrain
the properties of the inner dust envelope.

In our modeling, we computed the polarized intensity maps
at the wavelengths observed with SPHERE-ZIMPOL and also
the fraction of scattered light in the near-IR wavelengths studied
by Norris et al. (2012). While our visible polarimetric imaging
data allow us to constrain the properties of the innermost cir-
cumstellar environment, they cannot constrain the properties of
grain species that give rise to the IR features. Therefore, we did
not attempt to ﬁt the SED. As mentioned in Sect. 1, Khouri et
al. (2015) carried out a detailed modeling of the SED, including
various dust features.

The radiation of the central star was approximated with a
blackbody of 2500 K as in Khouri et al. (2015). We adopted an
angular diameter of 46.6 mas measured in the continuum with
AMBER, which results in a radius of 383 R(cid:12) and a luminosity

of 5130 L(cid:12) when combined with the distance of 78 pc from
Knapp et al. (2003).

To explain the clumpy structure seen in the polarized inten-
sity maps, we considered a dust shell model with a density en-
hancement, which is deﬁned by a cone as depicted in Fig. 8a.
The inner boundary of the dust shell was set to be the radius
at which the dust temperature reaches a condensation tempera-
ture of 1500 K. We assumed the radial density distribution to be
∝ r−3 for the following reason. While the density distribution
proportional to r−2 corresponds to a stationary mass loss with a
constant velocity, the density gradient in the innermost region of
the envelope is expected to be steeper because the wind speed
should increase at the base of the stellar wind. This is supported
by the mid-infrared interferometric observations of Mira stars
by Karovicova et al. (2013). These data probe the inner region
of the circumstellar envelope, and their modeling shows that the
power-law index of the density distribution of Al2O3 is 2.5–2.9.
The free parameters in our clump model are the optical depth
in the visible (550 nm) in the radial direction, the outer bound-
ary radius of the shell, the half-opening angle of the cone of the
density enhancement, and the ratio of the density in the cone and
in the remaining region of the shell. We considered three grain
species, corundum (Al2O3), forsterite (Mg2SiO4), and enstatite
(MgSiO3), because they are thought to survive at high tempera-
tures thanks to their low opacity in the visible and near-IR. The
absorption and scattering cross sections, as well as the scatter-
ing matrix elements, were computed with the code of Bohren &
Huﬀman (1983) for spherical grains, using the complex refrac-
tive index measured by Koike et al. (1995) for Al2O3 and the
measurements of J¨ager et al. (2003) for Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3.

each panel, the red solid line represents the observed data, while the blue dashed line represents the model.

We also computed models with the complex refractive index of
Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 measured by Scott & Duley (1996) to ex-
amine possible eﬀects of diﬀerent measurements.

Figure 8 shows the IP maps at 645, 717, and 820 nm pre-
dicted by the best-ﬁt model with 0.5 µm Al2O3 grains together
with the observed data. This model is characterized by a den-
sity enhancement with a half-opening angle of 45◦ and a den-
sity ratio of 4 within and outside the cone. The inner and outer
boundary radius is 1.9 and 3 R(cid:63), respectively, and the 550 nm
optical depth is 0.1. As Fig. 8a shows, the viewing angle mea-
sured from the symmetry axis is 85◦. The density enhancement
manifests itself as asymmetry in the IP maps. The ratio of the
polarized intensity measured on the brightest clump in the north
and the faintest clump in the SW in the SPHERE-ZIMPOL data
is 2.7, 2.5, and 1.8 at 645 nm, 717 nm, and 820 nm, respectively.
The model predicts the ratio to be 2.3, 2.1, and 2.4 at 645, 717,
and 820 nm, respectively, which agree with the observed ratios.
Figure 9 shows the 1-D cuts of the observed and model polarized
intensity in the north-south direction. The ﬁgure shows that our
model can reproduce the observed ratio of the polarized inten-
sity peaks reasonably well given the simpliﬁcations adopted in
the model. However, the polarized intensity at the center of this
model is much lower than the observed data. We assumed a den-
sity enhancement in only one direction, while we detected three
clumps possibly with diﬀerent density enhancements. Therefore,
density distributions that are more complex than assumed here
may reconcile the discrepancy in the polarized intensity near the
center.

Figure 8b shows a comparison of the predicted fraction of
scattered light at 1.04, 1.24, and 2.06 µm and the observed val-
ues from Norris et al. (2012). The fraction of scattered light pre-
dicted by the model agrees fairly well with the observed values,
although the model predicts that the fraction should be higher
than the observed value by a factor of ∼2 at 2.06 µm. However,
Norris et al. (2012) assumed a geometrically thin spherical shell
to derive the fraction of scattered light. Furthermore, the vari-
ability phase at the time of their observations was 0.2 (post-
maximum light), in contrast to the phase 0.9 of our SPHERE ob-
servations. These factors may explain the discrepancy of a factor
of 2 at 2.06 µm.

The parameters derived from our models with Mg2SiO4 or
MgSiO3 are similar to those of the best-ﬁt model with Al2O3.
The results obtained with the complex refractive indices of
Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 measured by Scott & Duley (1996) also
agree with those obtained with the data of J¨ager et al. (2003).
Our modeling with three grain species results in a 550 nm opti-

cal depth of 0.1 ± 0.02 with grain sizes of 0.4–0.5 µm, and an
inner and outer boundary radius of 1.9–2.0 R(cid:63) (deﬁned by the
assumed condensation temperature of 1500 K) and 3 ± 0.5 R(cid:63).
The density enhancement is characterized by a half-opening an-
gle of 45◦±15◦ and a density ratio of 4 ± 1. For the half-opening
angle of 45◦, viewing angles between 60◦ and 100◦ (measured
from the symmetry axis as shown in Fig. 8a) reproduce the ob-
served ratios of the polarized intensity between the brightest and
faintest clumps. As we explain in the next section, the models
with a grain size smaller than ∼0.3 µm cannot reproduce the ob-
served polarized intensity maps. On the other hand, if the grain
size is larger than ∼0.6 µm, the predicted fractions of scattered
light at 1.04, 1.24, and 2.06 µm are much higher than the ob-
served values from Norris et al. (2012).

5. Discussion
The grain size of 0.4–0.5 µm derived from our modeling is larger
than the 0.3 µm derived by Norris et al. (2012). If the grain ra-
dius of 0.3 µm is adopted in our model, the 550 nm optical depth
should be increased to 0.5 to explain the observed fraction of
scattered light from 1.04 to 2.06 µm. Then the optical depth
along the line of sight grazing the inner boundary of the dust
shell becomes much larger than 1, even if the optical depth in
the radial direction is still below 1. Multiple scattering for an
optical depth larger than 1 leads to very low polarization at the
inner boundary, which is not observed in our SPHERE-ZIMPOL
data. However, given the diﬀerences in the observational data,
variability phase, and the assumptions in the models, the diﬀer-
ence between the 0.3 µm derived by Norris et al. (2012) and
the 0.4–0.5 µm from our modeling does not seem to be serious.
The dust mass from our model is 5.8 × 10−10 M(cid:12) with a bulk
density of 4 g cm−3 adopted for Al2O3. This is comparable to
the (1.09 ± 0.02) × 10−9 M(cid:12) estimated by Norris et al. (2012),
despite the diﬀerence in the grain size. The dust mass from our
model also agrees well with 4.9×10−10 M(cid:12) derived by Khouri et
al. (2015), who also assumed a grain size of 0.3 µm. Therefore,
our modeling based on the SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric im-
ages conﬁrms the predominance of large, transparent grains in
W Hya very close to the star, ∼2 R(cid:63), and reveals that the grain
size is even larger than derived by Norris et al. (2012).
H¨ofner (2008) presents dynamical models with the mass loss
driven by the scattering of stellar photons. The parameters of
these models (stellar mass, luminosity, eﬀective temperature,
and pulsation period) are comparable to those of W Hya, if not
perfectly optimized for W Hya. The models predict that the grain

11

Ohnaka et al.: Clumpy dust formation and molecular outer atmosphere of the AGB star W Hya

size can reach 0.36–0.66 µm at 2–3 R(cid:63). The grain size of 0.4–
0.5 µm as well as the inner radius of the dust shell derived from
our modeling agrees with these predictions, lending support to
the scenario that the scattering due to large, transparent grains
can drive the mass loss in oxygen-rich AGB stars.

In the dynamical models of H¨ofner (2008), however, the nu-
cleation of dust grains from the gas phase is not considered.
While the growth of Mg2SiO4 grains is followed in a time-
dependent manner, the presence of seed nuclei is assumed, and
their amount is treated as a free parameter. Gobrecht et al. (2016
and references therein) present comprehensive models for non-
equilibrium chemical processes of gas and dust in the inner wind
of AGB stars, incorporating the nucleation of dust grains from
the gas phase, although dynamical aspects such as the radiation
pressure on dust grains and the mass loss are not included. Their
models predict that Al2O3 forms within 2 R(cid:63), and that the grain
radius reaches 0.3 µm in some cases. These model predictions
are consistent with our results, given that the models of Gobrecht
et al. (2016) are optimized for the Mira star IK Tau, which is
more evolved than W Hya. Their models predict that Mg2SiO4
forms beyond 3 R(cid:63) and that MgSiO3 is far less abundant than
Mg2SiO4. Therefore, Al2O3, rather than iron-poor silicates, may
be the more plausible constituent of the clumpy dust clouds de-
tected in our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations. Adjusting these
models for W Hya would allow us to test the non-equilibrium
chemistry using the present data.

The observed polarized intensity maps suggest that a few
large dust clumps nearly cover the entire sphere. In the case of
the model shown in Fig. 8, the solid angle of the density en-
hancement is 4π × 0.15 str, which means that approximately
seven clumps can cover the entire sphere. Freytag & H¨ofner
(2008) present 3-D convective simulations for AGB stars with
dust formation. Their models show that the stellar surface is
covered by a few, large convective cells and that the star pul-
sates with a typical time scale of one year. Dust forms behind
the shock fronts associated with the pulsation and the convec-
tive cells. The dust formation region appears nearly spherical but
with noticeable irregularities of the size of the convective cells.
Although their 3-D models assume a carbon-rich chemistry un-
like that of W Hya, a similar phenomenon may be expected in
oxygen-rich cases as well. The polarized intensity maps obtained
with SPHERE-ZIMPOL show similar signatures—dust forma-
tion in an incomplete shell with clumpy structures. Therefore,
our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations lend support to the dust for-
mation associated with the shocks induced by the pulsation and
convection.

6. Concluding remarks
We have presented visible polarimetric imaging observations of
the AGB star W Hya with SPHERE-ZIMPOL and high spectral
resolution (λ/∆λ = 12000) interferometric observations with
VLTI/AMBER in the individual CO ﬁrst overtone lines near
2.3 µm. The polarized intensity maps obtained at ﬁve wave-
lengths between 645 and 820 nm with spatial resolutions of
23–30 mas reveal three clumpy dust clouds close to the star, at
∼50 mas (∼2 R(cid:63)). The continuum-subtracted Hα image shows
asymmetrically extended emission up to ∼160 mas, implying the
propagation of shocks up to ∼7 R(cid:63).
The VLTI/AMBER observations have allowed us to spa-
tially resolve the outer atmosphere of W Hya. The ﬁtting of
the AMBER data in the continuum in the 2.3 µm region with
a power-law-type limb-darkened disk resulted in a stellar di-
ameter of 46.6 ± 1.0 mas with a limb-darkening parameter of

12

2.1 ± 0.2. On the other hand, the AMBER data in the CO lines
suggest that the atmosphere is extended to ∼70 mas (∼3 R(cid:63)) with
Gaussian-like intensity distributions. Our high angular resolu-
tion observations with SPHERE-ZIMPOL and VLTI/AMBER
reveals the coexistence of dust, molecular gas, and Hα-emitting
hot gas within 2–3 R(cid:63).

Our Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling suggests the
presence of 0.4–0.5 µm grains of Al2O3, Mg2SiO4, or MgSiO3
in an optically thin (τ550nm = 0.1 ± 0.02) shell with an inner
and outer radius of 1.9–2 R(cid:63) and 3 ± 0.5 R(cid:63), respectively. The
grain size and the location of the dust formation is consistent
with the hydrodynamical models with the mass loss driven by the
scattering due to large grains. The clumpy structures detected in
the SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric images lend support to the
3-D simulations, in which dust forms behind the shock fronts
associated with pulsation and large convective cells.

Our SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations took place at pre-
maximum light. Given the clear periodicity in the light curve of
W Hya, monitoring observations with SPHERE-ZIMPOL fol-
lowing the variability phase is extremely important in order to
understand the role of pulsation in dust formation and mass loss.
Moreover, the velocity-resolved imaging with VLTI/AMBER
taking advantage of its high spatial and high spectral resolution
enables us to probe the gas dynamics in a model-independent
manner. The velocity-resolved imaging in the CO lines and H2O
lines is ideal for detecting the initial acceleration of gas within
∼3 R(cid:63) and, therefore, is indispensable for clarifying the driving
mechanism of the mass loss.
