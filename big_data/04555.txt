Intense Flare-CME Event of the Year 2015:
Propagation and Interaction Eﬀects between Sun and
Earth’s Orbit

Abhishek Johri · P.K. Manoharan

c(cid:13) Springer ••••

Abstract In this paper, We report the interplanetary eﬀects of a fast coronal
mass ejection (CME) associated with the intense X2.7 ﬂare that occurred on
05 May 2015. The near-Sun signatures of the CME at low-coronal heights <2
R(cid:12) are obtained from the EUV images at 171 ˚A and metric radio observations.
The intensity and duration of the CME-driven radio bursts in the near-Sun and
interplanetary medium indicate this CME event to be an energetic one. The
interplanetary scintillation data, along with the low-frequency radio spectrum,
played a crucial role in understanding the radial evolution of the speed and
expansion of the CME in the inner heliosphere as well as its interaction with
a preceding slow CME. The estimation of the speed of the CME at several
points along the Sun to 1 AU shows shows that i) the CME went through a
rapid acceleration as well as expansion up to a height of ≈6 R(cid:12), and ii) the
CME continued to propagate at speed ≥800 kms−1 between the Sun and 1
AU. These results show that the CME likely overcame the drag exerted by
the ambient/background solar-wind with the support of its internal magnetic
energy. When the CME interacted with a slow preceding CME, the turbulence
level associated with the CME-driven disturbance increased signiﬁcantly.

1. Introduction

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are violent explosions in the atmosphere of the
Sun that carry massive magnetised plasma (1012 −1013 kg) into the interplan-
etary medium. Their velocities range from 10 to 2000 kms−1. CMEs have been
identiﬁed as the cause of major geo-magnetic storms and many studies have been
made to understand their times of arrival as well as eﬀects at 1 AU. Since CMEs
can evolve considerably in speed and shape on their way from the Sun to 1 AU,
the propagation eﬀects of the CMEs in interplanetary space become essential in
predicting their arrival at 1 AU. However, the relative importance of evolutionary
processes can diﬀer from one event to the other and it depends on i) the initial
energy of the eruption of the CME, ii) solar-wind conditions along its path of
propagation, and iii) the physical characteristics of the CME (e.g. Gosling et
al., 1998; Gopalswamy et al., 2001a; Manoharan et al., 2001). Moreover, since
a CME phenomenon is three-dimensional and ambient solar wind surrounding
the CME propagation is often highly structured in space and time, the CME-
driven disturbances in the solar-wind can be more complex. Therefore, for a
better understanding of the eﬀects of the propagation of a CME, multi-point
observations between Sun and 1 AU are required.

In this article we report the propagation eﬀects of a fast CME associated with
the intense X2.7 ﬂare that occurred on 05 May 2015 at N15E75. In determining
the speed of a CME, the eﬀects of projection can be crucial. Since the above
event originated close to the east limb of the Sun, projection eﬀects may not
be signiﬁcant. In this multi-wavelength analysis, the near-Sun signatures of
the eruption have been obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA:
Pesnell, W.D., Thompson, B.J., and Chamberlin, P.C., 2012) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) at 171 ˚A. The white-light images from the Large
Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO: Brueckner, G.E., Howard, R.A., and
Koomen, M.J., 1995) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO),
combined with the radio measurements from Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (Hi-
RAS) and WAVES radio experiment of Wind spacecraft (Bougeret, J.L., Kaiser,
M.L., and Kellogg, P.J., 1995) spectra, have been employed to infer the speed
and energetics of the CME at heights of ≤20 R(cid:12) (where, 1 solar radius (R(cid:12)) =
6.96 × 105 km). Midway between Sun and 1 AU, the CME-driven disturbances
as well as its interaction characteristics with a preceding slow CME have been
inferred from interplanetary scintillation observations made with the Ooty Radio
Telescope (ORT: Swarup et al., 1971).

2. Observations of AR#2339

The current solar cycle seems to be running low in activity in comparison with
the recent previous cycles (e.g. Hathway, 2010; Manoharan, 2012). However,
a couple of active regions of the current cycle were exceptionally active and
produced a large number of ﬂare events and associated CMEs. One such active
region, AR2339, became active from its appearance at the east limb of the Sun
on 04 May 2015 and continued until it rotated to the back of the Sun on 17 May

SOLA: archive.tex; 16 March 2016; 0:27; p. 2

Intense Flare-CME Event of the Year 2015

2015. It had an overall magnetic conﬁguration of βγ and grew to a fairly large
area of ≈840 millionths on 10 May 2015. AR2339 produced more than 60 X-ray
ﬂares of C-class intensity or more, during its passage from east to west limbs
of the Sun. It is to be noted that the number of optical ﬂares produced by this
active region outnumbered the X-ray events. However, the rate of occurrence of
ﬂares gradually declined after its crossing of the central meridian of the Sun. In
this study, we consider the near-Sun, interplanetary propagation eﬀects of a fast
CME that occurred on 05 May 2015 at this active region as well as its interaction
eﬀects in the Sun–1 AU distance.

2.1. X-ray and EUV Observations

On 05 May 2015, when the AR2339 was located close to the east limb of the
Sun at N15E75, the onset of the X2.7-class ﬂare was observed at about 22:05
UT in the wavelength bands of 1–8 ˚A and 0.5–4 ˚A by the X-ray Sensor (XRS)1
onboard the GOES-15 spacecraft. Figure 1 displays the X-ray ﬂux proﬁles of
the ﬂare event during the period 21:30–23:30 UT in the above two wavelength
bands. The ﬂuxes in these channels started to rise at 22:07 UT and reached
a maximum value within about four minutes and returned to the background
value after about two hours. It is also to be noted that the harder part (0.5–4
˚A) of the X-ray ﬂux increased by more than about three orders of magnitude in
comparison with its mean background value. However, the soft (1–8 ˚A) X-ray
spectrum increased only about two orders with respect to its background. It is
likely that the heating at the ﬂare site was eﬃcient to produce the hard part of
the X-ray spectrum.

2.1.1. EUV Near-Sun Images

AIA recorded the eruption of the CME associated with the X2.7 ﬂare event,
in a wideband of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission. Before the onset of the
X-ray ﬂare, AIA images showed the destabilisation of the ﬁlament at the ﬂare
site and the eruption of the ﬁlament was seen at ≈22:07 UT. The eruption was
also associated with the enhanced emission of X-ray (refer to Figure 1) as well
as EUV emission over a band of wavelengths 94–1700 ˚A. At the rising phase of
the ﬂare, the AIA images showed the radial motion of mass and ﬂux rope along
the position angle of ≈50◦. Figure 2 shows the running-diﬀerence partial frame
images from AIA observed in the 171 ˚A band. At the time of maximum of the
X-ray proﬁle, ≈22:11 UT, the eruption seen in EUV reached a height of about
1.5 R(cid:12), with respect to the centre of the Sun. The projected speed of the EUV
eruption in the plane of the sky along its propagation direction is ≈1300 kms−1.
Since the location of the CME origin is close to the limb of the Sun, the projection
eﬀect is expected to be minimal and the sky-plane speed represents the actual
speed of the CME. However, the rate of change of width of the eruption in the
direction perpendicular to its radial direction was signiﬁcantly less and the speed

of the lateral expansion was typically ≈300 kms−1. For example, in the AIA ﬁeld
of view, the angular width of the eruption typically increased from ≈3◦ to ≈7◦ in
the position angle, which determined the typical lateral expansion. These rates
correspond to a radial expansion of about four times faster than the lateral
expansion. The above east-limb eruption was also recorded by the Sun Watcher
with Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing (SWAP) telescope at
174 ˚A onboard the Project for On-Board Autonomy-2 spacecraft (PROBA-2:
Halain et al., 2013; Seaton et al., 2013). The ﬁndings obtained from AIA are

consistent with the SWAP measurements. The expansion of the CME and its
associated ﬁlament eruption could be tracked up to about 1.5 R(cid:12).

2.1.2. Radio Signatures of the CME

The radio signatures associated with the ﬂare/CME event were observed over
a wide range of frequencies: i) HiRAS provided the radio manifestations of the
CME in a frequency range of 30 to 2500 MHz, and ii) Wind /WAVES covered
frequencies below 14 MHz. The above spectra are useful to infer the radio sig-
natures of the CME in the solar-height range of about 0.1 to ≥30 R(cid:12). Figure 3
shows the radio spectra observed on 05 and 06 May 2015 by the HiRAS solar
radio spectrograph and Wind /WAVES space mission. At the time of the CME
onset, 22:07 UT, the opening of bundle of magnetic ﬁeld lines were revealed by a
group of intense Type-III bursts at frequencies below 500 MHz (refer to Figure
3a). The well-organised collimated eruption seen with AIA (refer to Figure 2)
is also consistent with the propagation of the CME along the open-ﬁeld lines
(i.e. magnetic funnel type of structure) formed above the system of loops at
the active region. In the HiRAS spectrum (Figure 3a), a broad-band diﬀused
emission was also observed at high frequencies (≈700–1800 MHz) around 22:07
UT and it is likely associated with the on-going small-scale reconnections at the
ﬂare site at low coronal heights.

The fast eruption seen in the AIA EUV images has caused a shock, which
is consistent with the intense fast drifting metric Type-II radio burst observed
in the frequency range of ≈50–80 MHz during 22:12:00 to 22:13:30 UT (refer
to AIA images in Figure 2 and the HiRAS spectrum shown in Figure 3a). In
the above time range, a fast drifting Type-II was also independently observed
by the Culgoora Radio Spectrograph in the frequency range of ≈25–40 MHz.
These spectra from Culgoora and HiRAS observatories conﬁrm, respectively,
the fundamental and second harmonic emissions of the Type-II burst (e.g. Wild,
J.P., Murray, J.D., and Rowe, W.C., 1954). This harmonic emission was also seen
weakly in the HiRAS spectrum. The frequency coverage of the Type-II shows the
typical height of the shock between 1.6 and 1.8 R(cid:12), with respect to the centre
of the Sun (e.g. Pohjolainen et al., 2007). At these heights, the overall drift rate
of the Type-II burst suggests a shock speed of ≈1500 kms−1. In fact, the shock
speed associated with an eruption is always higher than the average speed of the
eruption. In the present case, the observed Type-II speed and the radial speed of
the eruption seen in the AIA images (as well as from PROBA-2/SWAP images)
at nearly similar solar heights are consistent.

Another important point is that the intense high-frequency Type-III bursts
observed in the HiRAS spectrograph, continued to the interplanetary medium as
shown by the Wind /WAVES spectrum (Figure 3b), and manifested as an intense
long-duration burst, lasting for more than 90 minutes, at frequencies below 1
MHz. This conﬁrms that at the ﬂare site a copious amount of energetic electrons
were produced and pumped into interplanetary space (as the ﬂare-associated
eruption led to the opening of the magnetic-ﬁeld lines), which extended to larger
heights in the interplanetary medium. Such low-frequency long-duration Type-
III radio bursts, when associated with Type-II events have shown statistical

SOLA: archive.tex; 16 March 2016; 0:27; p. 6

Intense Flare-CME Event of the Year 2015

association with solar energetic particle (SEP) events (e.g. MacDowall et al.,
2003; Gopalswamy and M¨akel¨a, 2010). Thus, if the origin of the event under
study were favourably located with respect to the Earth, a particle event would
most probably have been observed at the Earth. Additionally, the Type-II burst
signatures were also observed in the low-frequency part of the Wind /WAVES
spectrum, at frequencies below 1 MHz (however, the Type-II feature was not
visible in the 1–14 MHz part of the spectrum). A broadband drifting feature
seen below 1 MHz started at about 02:00 UT (Figure 3c) and by that time the
CME had crossed a solar height of ≈18 R(cid:12) in the LASCO-C3 ﬁeld of view.
The wide frequency range of Type-III bursts in the near-Sun as well as in the
interplanetary medium (including fast Type-II burst) suggests that the CME was
involved with a signiﬁcant high energy (e.g. MacDowall et al., 2003; Gopalswamy
and M¨akel¨a, 2010).

As the CME moved away from the active region (before and after the onset
of the Type-II burst), intense continuum emissions were also recorded by both
Culgoora and HiRAS spectrographs, in the frequency range of 50–200 MHz.
Additionally, within the above continuum, there were several vertical structures.
After the end of the Type-II burst, the continuum was observed at frequencies
below 70 MHz. However, the intensity of the above radio continuum was much
weaker than the Type-III and Type-II radio bursts. The signatures of the broad-
band continuum at times before the onset of the Type-II burst suggests that the
emission originating from the system of rising loops resulted at the time of the
CME eruption. The weak low-frequency continuum emission during the Type-II
and up to ≈22:15 UT is likely to be associated with the expansion of the ﬁlament
and the energetic electrons trapped within the propagating CME structure (e.g.
Gosling et al., 1998; Manoharan and Kundu, 2003).

2.2. LASCO White-Light Images and CME Speed

The onset of the fast moving CME was observed at 22:24 UT in the LASCO-
C2 ﬁeld of view at 4.3 R(cid:12). Figure 4 shows the sequence of running diﬀerence
white-light images from C2 and C3 coronagraphs of LASCO. In these “posi-
tion angle-distance” images, the radial evolution of the propagating CME is
evidently seen in C2 (Figure 4a,c) and C3 (Figure 4d,f) ﬁelds of view and the
bright embedded ﬁlament structure can also be clearly identiﬁed (in Figure 4f).
Moreover, as observed in Figure 4a, when the CME onset occurred in the C2
coronagraph, the lateral width of the CME (i.e. in the perpendicular orientation
to that of the propagation direction along the position angle of ≈50◦) was more
than 2 R(cid:12). This reveals that the overall size of the CME has gone through a
rather rapid expansion and also CME has been accelerated between AIA and
LASCO ﬁelds of view. The rate of lateral expansion of the CME corresponds to
a speed of ≈900 kms−1. It is likely that the CME material, the ejecta as well as
the magnetic ﬁeld, have gone through the process of pressure balance with the
surrounding solar-wind. For example, a CME can expand, if it is ejected from the
Sun with a speed higher than the ambient solar-wind causing a speed gradient.
The ambient solar-wind estimates, obtained from the interplanetary scintillation
measurements made with the ORT at a distance mid way between the Sun and

Figure 4. Running-diﬀerence images from LASCO-C2 and -C3 coronagraphs as indicated,
observed on 05 May 2015. Panel f shows the raw image (without running subtraction) and
ﬁlament is indicated by an arrow. The limb of the Sun is shown by white line.

Earth and from the in-situ data at 1 AU, indicate a low-speed heliosphere of
about 300–350 kms−1 in the space ahead of the CME. It is likely that in order
to maintain the pressure balance between the CME and the ambient solar-wind,
the CME has gone through the sudden expansion.

The quick acceleration of the CME along its radial direction has also been
shown by the height–time plot obtained from the AIA EUV and LASCO white-
light images. Figure 5 shows the height–time plot of the CME and its derived
speeds in the LASCO ﬁeld of view. The height–time plot has been restricted to
C2/C3 white-light images having good contrast and the low signal-to-noise ratio
images are not considered. This plot also includes the height–time measurements
obtained from the AIA images observed at 171 ˚A. An important point revealed
in this plot is that when the initial three measurements of the LASCO images
are considered (i.e. two images from C2 and one image from C3 coronagraphs),
the speed of the CME is rather high, around 1600 kms−1. As stated earlier, since
the originating location of the CME on the Sun is close to the east limb, the
projection eﬀect on the speed estimate obtained from the plane of sky images
is expected to be less signiﬁcant. The speed obtained from the initial images
of LASCO is consistent with the speed of the shock (1500 kms−1) estimated
from the Type-II radio burst at distances between AIA and LASCO ﬁelds of
view (refer to Section 2.1.2). In fact, the CME has thus gone through a steady
acceleration in the near-Sun region between 1.5 and 6 R(cid:12) (Figure 5). At greater
heights between 8 and 20 R(cid:12) in the C3 ﬁeld of view, the speed of the CME

however remained nearly constant at about 840 kms−1, which was also well
above the ambient solar-wind speed.

3. CME–CME Interaction and Interplanetary Scintillation

Measurements

On 05 May 2015, the active region, AR2339, also produced another intense X-ray
ﬂare of intensity M1.2, which peaked at ≈13:53 UT in the 1–8 ˚A channel of the
GOES-15 spacecraft. This event also originated at N15E75. However, the X-ray
proﬁle reveals it to be a short-duration event. The onset of the CME associated
with this ﬂare event was observed at 14:12 UT in the C2 ﬁeld of view of LASCO
(Figure 6) and its width was ≈70◦. It also propagated along the position angle
of ≈50◦ and produced Type-III and Type-II radio bursts. However, the radio
signatures were much less intense than that of the above later CME and the
Type-III burst did not cause a long-duration event. The speed of the Type-II
shock associated with the CME was ≈1000 kms−1. However, the speed of the
CME in the LASCO C2/C3 ﬁelds of view was low at ≈350 kms−1. This CME
preceded the above discussed later CME at 22:24 UT (Figure 4). Since the speed
of the later CME was more than twice the speed of the preceding CME, in the
course of time the later one interacted with it at ≈50–75 R(cid:12) at about 08:00 to
10:00 UT. The interaction characteristics are weakly shown by the low-frequency
radio spectrum (≤1 MHz part; indicated by white circles in Figure 3c) in the time

Abhishek Johri and P.K. Manoharan

Figure 6. Running-diﬀerence images from LASCO-C2 for the CME event preceded the CME
event under study. CME ﬁrst appeared in the LASCO-C2 ﬁeld of view at ≈14:12 UT on 05

span of ≈10:00 to 14:00 UT (cf. Gopalswamy et al., 2001b; Lahkar et al., 2010).
The interplanetary scintillation observations at the ORT show the turbulence
and speed associated with the interaction phenomenon in the inner heliosphere,
at distances outside the LASCO ﬁeld of view.

3.1. Interplanetary Scintillation Observations of CMEs

In this study, interplanetary scintillation (IPS) measurements, obtained from the
ORT at 327 MHz, have been employed to investigate the view of the ambient
solar-wind (e.g. Manoharan, 2012) and the three-dimensional evolution of the
CME in the inner heliosphere (e.g. Manoharan et al., 2001; Manoharan, 2006).
At the ORT, everyday routine monitoring of IPS is made on a large number
of compact radio sources and the measurement on each source yields the esti-
mates of solar-wind speed and normalised scintillation index (g-value) at a point
closest to the solar approach of the line-of-sight to the source (e.g. Manoharan
and Ananthakrishnan, 1990; Manoharan, 2006). The normalised index (g-value)
represents the turbulence level of the solar-wind (∆Ne). At Ooty, on 06 May
2015, two scans of the sky were observed (Figure 7), in a distance range of
40 to 250 R(cid:12). Each scan included a number of sources. The IPS observation
on each source represents the line-of-sight integration and a computer-aided
tomographic reconstruction of IPS measurements from a large number of lines-
of-sight would be useful to remove the eﬀect of integration (e.g. Jackson et al.,
1997; Manoharan, 2010; Jackson et al., 2015). However, in this study, we use the
raw IPS data to analyse the propagation eﬀects of the CME and CME–CME
interaction in the inner heliosphere.

3.1.1. IPS Images of CME

Figure 8 shows the snapshot scintillation images (g-maps) of the interplanetary
medium on 06 May 2015, respectively, during 00:00–09:00 UT and 10:00–17:00
UT. As indicated in each of the above images, the IPS measurements have been
made while the ORT was pointed, respectively, at hour angle (HA) positions
of -03h 40m and +04h 30m. Normally at the ORT, to start with, we scan the

SOLA: archive.tex; 16 March 2016; 0:27; p. 10

Intense Flare-CME Event of the Year 2015

interplanetary medium at a suitable position and then the ORT is moved ahead
to point at a similar part of the heliosphere. Such observing scans provide the
solar-wind measurements at similar parts of the heliosphere and can enable one
to track interplanetary disturbances (e.g. CMEs), if present, as well as change in
the solar-wind conditions. In fact, more than one scan will be useful to track the
propagation characteristics of the disturbance. For example when the telescope
was positioned at the HA = -03h 40m, at the start of the scan it probed sources
at ≈100◦ solar elongation on the west side of the Sun. It is to be noted that
since the hour angle of the ORT is ﬁxed, a radio source is observed for about
two minutes at the time of its transit at the telescope. In the subsequent time, the
electronic beam switching of the 12-beam system of the ORT allows observing
sources at diﬀerent declinations and enables to probe diﬀerent parts of inner
heliosphere (refer to Swarup et al., 1971; Manoharan et al., 2000). As the time
progresses, the direction of the probing region moves gradually close to the Sun
and then to the portion of the heliosphere in the east side to the Sun (also refer to
Figure 7). The high sensitivity of the ORT and its beam-forming system enable
the observation of a large part of the heliosphere in about six hours of observing
time. In the present case, we moved the ORT by ≈8h 10m in hour angle to the
west (i.e. HA = +04h 30m) and probed the heliosphere region from the west of
the Sun to the east (Figure 8, right panel).
The above images cover 500 × 500 pixels and they are smoothed by a Gaussian
of width 5 × 5 pixels. They are equivalent to the white-light images in the
sky plane projection and are useful to follow the three-dimensional evolution
of the ambient solar-wind as well as the turbulent regions associated with the
propagating disturbances in the IPS ﬁeld of view of 40–250 R(cid:12). In these images,
g-values close to unity correspond to the ambient level of density turbulence of
the solar-wind and it is represented by the red colour code, i.e. g≈1. In contrast,
the enhanced or depleted level of density turbulence is indicated by, respectively,
g-value >1 or <1. In the above images, the concentric circles are of radii 50, 100,
150, and 200 R(cid:12).
In these “position angle(PA)-heliocentric distance” images, the north is at
the top, i.e. PA = 0◦. The PAs, 90◦, 180◦, and 270◦, respectively, correspond to
east, south, and west of the Sun (Figure 8, left panel). The enhanced scintillation
indicates the presence of an interplanetary CME. For example, on the 06 May
IPS image, the onset of the CME in the IPS ﬁeld of view is seen between 50
and 100 R(cid:12) and it corresponds to a time period of ≈04:00–06:00 UT (refer to
Figure 7, which shows the time-series of estimates of solar-wind speed and g-
value). It is noted that the disturbance associated with the CME has expanded
considerably in the IPS ﬁeld of view and the comparison between these images
clearly shows the propagation of the CME in the eastern direction with respect
to the Sun. The time-series analysis of the Ooty observations reveals a better
understanding of the CME propagation as well as interaction between the above
discussed CMEs.

observations, respectively, 00:00–09:00 UT and 10:00–17:00 UT. Each point on
the plot represents the observation from a scintillating radio source. As discussed
in the previous section, the above two scans were observed, respectively, at
hour angles -03h 40m and +04h 30m. In each scan, to start with the western
heliospheric region with respect to the Sun is probed and as the time progressed,
the probing direction moves close to the Sun and later to the east of the Sun. On
each scan of the “distance–time” plot (top panel in Figure 7), the heliocentric
distance of an observed source is plotted with an open circle symbol and the
typical separation between the west and east sides of the heliosphere probed
with respect to Sun is shown by a vertical dotted line. This plot also includes
the average heliocentric distance covered over an observing time of ≈20 minutes
and are shown by open-triangle and ﬁlled-triangle symbols respectively.
In Figure 7, the dashed lines on the speed and g-value plots respectively
indicate the background solar-wind speed of ≈300 kms−1 and turbulence level of
g≈1. The estimation of the g-value can be obtained from most of the scintillating
radio sources and the g-plot includes observations of about 325 radio sources,
covering a wide range of distances in the heliosphere. In contrast, the speed
estimate from an IPS observation is limited to a temporal spectrum of high
signal-to-noise (i.e. S/N ≥ 15 dB) and the speed plot has been made from ≈200
data points of signiﬁcantly high signal-to-noise ratio observations.
In Figure 7, at the eastern side of the Sun, the heliocentric distance increases
with the observing time. The ﬁrst scan, observed during ≈00:00–09:00 UT, shows
the following solar-wind conditions: i) the ambient/background solar-wind is
probed before the onset of the CME(s) in the IPS ﬁeld of view; ii) after the
onset of the CME in the IPS ﬁeld of view, most of the lines of sight of the radio
sources pass through diﬀerent parts of the propagating CME structure and their
g-values provide the typical size of the interplanetary CME structure; iii) only
a few radio sources point outside the CME structure and their g-values lie close
to the background line; iv) at the onset time of the CME, the lines of sight pass
through the CME structure in the distance range of ≈50 and 100 R(cid:12), which is
observed as a gradual rise in g-value in the time period of ≈04:00–07:00 UT;
v) timings and distances involved in these observations also indicate that the
CME is propelled fast at speed >800 kms−1; vi) however, the turbulence level
associated with it is less than that observed at ≈08:00 UT; vii) at distances >100
R(cid:12) (i.e. at times >06:00 to 09:00 UT), the solar-wind region between CMEs, and
the preceding CME are probed; viii) around 08:00 UT, the speed plot indicates
the low speed associated with the preceding CME.

As indicated by the speeds of these CMEs in the LASCO ﬁeld of view as well
as by radio signatures, the CME–CME interaction is likely to happen around
08:00–10:00 UT, at a height of about 50–75 R(cid:12). The second IPS scan of the
interplanetary medium pictures the status of the solar-wind just after the inter-
action. The condition of the solar-wind after the interaction of CMEs is, i) the
overall turbulence level is high, ii) the average speed of the solar-wind is well
above the background solar-wind, iii) as shown by the IPS images, the intense
part of the turbulence is wide and it includes both the CMEs. In the second
scan, the high speed points are also observed before the peaking of g-values, i.e.
behind the CMEs.

Figure 7. Time series of IPS observations on 06 May 2015. The bottom and middle panels
show velocity and g-value plots, respectively. The horizontal dashed lines on speed and g-value
plots respectively indicate the background solar-wind speed of ≈300 kms−1 and turbulence
level of g≈1. In the top panel, the circle symbol represents the heliocentric distance to the line
of sight to the radio source and triangles (open and ﬁlled) represent the distance average over
≈20 minutes of observation. The separation between west and east sides of the heliosphere
probed with respect to Sun is shown by a vertical-dotted line.

Another important point to be noted is that as revealed by the IPS observa-
tions, the CME before and after interaction has travelled well above the speed
of the background solar-wind. In fact, the eﬀective drag force experienced by a
CME is largely determined by the diﬀerence in speeds between the CME and the
ambient solar-wind and it is proportional to |VCM E - Vambient|2 (Manoharan,
2006). In the present case, the speed of the CME is >800 kms−1, which would
have suﬀered the reduction of speed due to the interaction of the CME with the
ambient solar-wind of speed ≈300–350 kms−1. Since the CME seems to continue
to propagate at a speed higher than the ambient solar-wind, it is possible that
the internal magnetic energy associated with the ﬁlament (or ﬂux rope) supports
to propel the CME structure out into the solar-wind (e.g. Chen et al., 1997;
Manoharan and Mujiber Rahman, 2011).

Figure 8. Interplanetary scintillation images observed with the ORT on 06 May 2015. In
these “position angle–distance” diagrams, Sun is at the centre and concentric circles are of
radii 50, 100, 150, 200 R(cid:12). The colour scale shows the normalised scintillation index (g-value).
Time increases from the right-hand side of the image to the left-hand side of the image. The
indicated hour angle (HA) positions correspond to the ORT pointing directions. The position
angles (PAs), 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, and 270◦, respectively, correspond to north, east, south, and west
of the Sun.

4. Discussion and Summary

The propagation eﬀects of the (X2.7 related) fast CME of 05 May 2015 have been
analysed using a combination of data from EUV, radio, white-light, and IPS
observations in the Sun to 1-AU distance range. The ﬁlament oscillation is ﬁrst
seen in the AIA 171 ˚A images at 22:05 UT, just prior to the onset of the eruption.
The fast eruption of ﬁlament is observed with a velocity of ≈1300 kms−1 in the
time range of 22:10–22:14 UT at heights below 1.5 R(cid:12) and in this period, the
rate of expansion of the CME in the lateral direction (i.e. perpendicular to the
direction of propagation) is conﬁned and it is much smaller than the eruption
speed. The intense Type-III radio burst, along the open ﬁeld lines above the
eruption site, extends from the low corona (i.e. at frequency ≈500 MHz) all the
way into the interplanetary medium (frequency ≈100 kHz) and it suggests the
possible acceleration of particle by post-CME reconnection (e.g. McKenzie and
Hudson, 2001; Sheeley, N.R., Jr., Warren, H.P., and Wang, Y.M., 2004).

The speed of the CME-driven disturbances, from the white-light images and
the shock shown by the metric Type-II bursts, increases with height, peaking
at ≈1600 kms−1 at a solar-height of ≈6 R(cid:12) and then the speed stabilises at
≈840 kms−1 at greater heights. The LASCO images show the quick expansion
of the ﬁlament enclosed within the CME structure. This suggests that the CME
expands to maintain the pressure balance with the low-speed ambient solar-wind
(e.g. Manoharan et al., 2000).

Intense Flare-CME Event of the Year 2015

The interplanetary-scintillation observations show the large-scale propagation
of the CME through the interplanetary medium, its expanding structure and
distribution in the inner heliosphere. Even at heliocentric distances ≥60 R(cid:12), the
CME-driven disturbances move with speed in excess of 800 kms−1, which shows
that the eﬀective drag imposed by the low-speed background solar-wind seems
to be ineﬀective. It is likely that the internal magnetic energy in the ﬁlament
aids the expansion and propagation (e.g. Moore and Roumeliotis, 1992; Chen et
al., 1997; D´emoulin, 1998). The density depletion caused by a preceding CME
could also aid the propagation of the later CME. However, in the present case,
the prior CME could have started with a high initial speed, and in the LASCO
ﬁeld of view it likely slowed to a speed close to the ambient solar-wind speed.

The IPS observations on a large number of sources allow us to look at the
interaction between the fast CME and a slow-moving preceding CME, at the
heliocentric-distance range of ≈50–75 R(cid:12). It has been shown that the interaction
between CMEs leads to slowing down of the fast CME (e.g. Manoharan et al.,
2004). As the result of interaction, the turbulence level contributed by both the
CMEs has increased signiﬁcantly. Since at these heliocentric distances, the level
of turbulence is related to ∆Ne of the solar-wind, the density [Ne] within the
merged or interacted region is also expected to increase considerable. Although
it is not straightforward to infer the factor of increase of the solar-wind density,
it is inferred that the combined eﬀect of the CME structure and propagation
characteristics at further large distances would considerably alter the arrival of
the fast CME at 1 AU.
