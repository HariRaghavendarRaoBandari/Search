We ﬁnd that all measures of coherence are frozen for an initial state in a strictly incoherent channel
if and only if the relative entropy of coherence is frozen for the state. Our ﬁnding reveals the existence
of measure-independent freezing of coherence, and provides an entropy-based dynamical condition
in which the coherence of an open quantum system is totally unaﬀected by noise.

Quantum coherence is a fundamental feature of quan-
tum mechanics, describing the capability of a quantum
state to exhibit quantum interference phenomena. The
coherence eﬀect of a state is usually ascribed to the oﬀ-
diagonal elements of its density matrix with respect to a
particular reference basis, which is determined according
to the physical problem under consideration. It is an es-
sential ingredient in quantum information processing [1],
and plays a central role in emergent ﬁelds, such as quan-
tum metrology [2–4], nanoscale thermodynamics [5–11],
and quantum biology [12–16].

It is only recent years that the quantiﬁcation of co-
herence has become a hot topic due to the development
of quantum information science, although the theory of
quantum coherence is historically well developed in quan-
tum optics [17–19]. A rigorous framework to quantify
the coherence of quantum states in the resource theo-
ries has been recently proposed after a series of eﬀorts
[20–29]. By following the rigorous framework compris-
ing four postulates [20], a number of coherence measures
based on various physical contexts have been put for-
ward. The l1 norm of coherence and the relative entropy
of coherence were ﬁrst suggested as two coherence mea-
sures based on distance. The coherence measures based
on entanglement [30], the coherence measures based on
operation [31, 32], and the coherence measures based on
convex-roof construction [33, 34] were subsequently pro-
posed. With coherence measures, various properties of
quantum coherence, such as the relations between quan-
tum coherence and other quantum resources [30, 35, 36],
the quantum coherence in inﬁnite-dimensional systems
[37, 38], the complementarity relations of quantum co-
herence [39], and the measure of macroscopic coherence
[40], have been discussed.

Quantum coherence is a useful physical resource, but
coherence of a quantum state is often destroyed by noise.
A challenge in exploiting the resource is to protect coher-
ence from the decoherence caused by noise, as the loss
of coherence may weaken the abilities of a state to per-
form quantum information processing tasks. Today, after
having been equipped with the knowledge of coherence
measures, it becomes possible to analyze under which
dynamical conditions the coherence of an open system
is frozen in a noisy channel. Studies on this topic have
[41], where the authors found that
been started in Ref.

the coherence measures based on bona ﬁde distances are
frozen for some initial states of a quantum system with
even number of qubits undergoing local identical bit ﬂip
channels. This ﬁnding illustrates that there exist such
quantum states of which some coherence measures re-
main constant in certain noisy channels, and hence the
ability of such states to perform quantum information
processing tasks is not weakened by the noise if the ability
exploited in the task is based on these frozen coherence
measures.

However, some coherence measures being frozen do not
imply other coherence measures being frozen too, since
diﬀerent coherence measures result in diﬀerent orderings
of coherence in general [42]. Freezing of coherence is de-
pendent on the coherence measures adopted in general.
Although a noisy channel may not weaken some abili-
ties of a quantum state if these abilities are based on
the frozen coherence measures, it can still weaken the
other abilities that are based on unfrozen coherence mea-
sures. Only the states with measure-independent freez-
ing of coherence can keep all the abilities of coherence
resource totally unaﬀected. Here, the phrase, measure-
independent freezing of quantum coherence, means that
coherence of some states is frozen independently of coher-
ence measures, i.e., all coherence measures of the states
are frozen in certain channels. The question then is:
Under which dynamical conditions does the measure-
independent freezing phenomenon occur for an open
quantum system in a noisy channel? This is an impor-
tant issue, since only in this case the coherence of an open
system is totally unaﬀected by noise. In this letter, we
address this issue.

To present our ﬁnding clearly, we need ﬁrst to recapit-
ulate some notions, such as incoherent states, incoherent
operations, strictly incoherent operations, and coherence
measures.

An incoherent state is deﬁned as
pi|iihi|,

δ = X

i

(1)

where {|ii} represent a ﬁxed reference basis, and pi are
probabilities. The set of all incoherent states is denoted
by I. All other states which cannot be written as di-
agonal matrices in this basis are called coherent states.
Hereafter, we use ρ to represent a general state, and δ
specially to denote an incoherent state.

An incoherent operation or an incoherent channel, i.e.,
an incoherent completely positive trace-preserving map
(incoherent CPTP) map, is deﬁned as

Λ(ρ) = X

n

KnρK†n,

(2)

A functional C can be taken as a coherence measure if

where
the Kraus operators Kn satisfy not only
Pn K†nKn = I but also KnIK†n ⊂ I for each Kn, i.e.
each Kn maps an incoherent state to an incoherent state.
An incoherent operation is called a strictly incoherent op-
eration or a strictly incoherent channel if Kn also satisfy
K†nIKn ⊂ I for each Kn [31, 43].
it satisﬁes the four postulates [20]:
(C1) C(ρ) ≥ 0, and C(ρ) = 0 if and only if ρ ∈ I;
(C2) Monotonicity under incoherent operations, C(ρ) ≥
C(Λ(ρ)) if Λ is an incoherent operation;
(C3) Monotonicity under selective incoherent operations,
C(ρ) ≥ Pn pnC(ρn), where pn = Tr(KnρK†n), ρn =
KnρK†n/pn, and Λ(ρ) = Pn KnρK†n is an incoherent op-
eration;
(C4) Non-increasing under mixing of quantum states,
i.e., convexity, Pn pnC(ρn) ≥ C(Pn pnρn) for any set
of states {ρn} and any probability distribution {pn}.
One well-known coherence measure is the relative en-
tropy of coherence Cr. It is deﬁned as

Cr(ρ) = min
δ∈I

S(ρ||δ),

(3)

where S(ρ||δ) = Tr ρ(log ρ− log δ) is the relative entropy.
With these notions, we can now state our main ﬁnding
as a theorem.

Theorem C(ρt) = C(ρ0) if and only if Cr(ρt) = Cr(ρ0),
where ρt = Λt(ρ0) with Λt being a strictly incoherent
channel and ρ0 being an initial state.

We only need to prove that C(ρt) = C(ρ0) if Cr(ρt) =
Cr(ρ0) in the theorem, since Cr is certainly frozen if all
measures are frozen.

First, we show that S(Λt(ρ0)||Λt(δ0)) = S(ρ0||δ0),
where δ0 is the diagonal part of the density matrix ρ0.
By deﬁnition, Cr(ρ) = minδ∈I S(ρ||δ). The minimum is
attained if and only if δ = ρd, where ρd is the diagonal
part of ρ [20], and then there is

Cr(ρ0) = S(ρ0||δ0).

(4)

By using the contractivity of the relative entropy, i.e.,
S(E(ρ1)||E(ρ2)) ≤ S(ρ1||ρ2) for any two states ρ1 and ρ2
under a CPTP map E [1, 44, 45], we have
S(Λt(ρ0)||Λt(δ0)) ≤ S(ρ0||δ0).

(5)

On the other hand, since Λt is an incoherent channel,
there is Λt(δ0) ∈ I, which further leads to

Cr(ρt) = min
δ∈I

S(ρt||δ) ≤ S(ρt||Λt(δ0)).

(6)

2

Combining Eqs. (4), (5), and (6), we obtain the inequal-
ity,

Cr(ρt) ≤ S(ρt||Λt(δ0)) ≤ Cr(ρ0).

(7)

In the condition of Cr(ρt) = Cr(ρ0), Eq. (7) results in

Cr(ρt) = S(ρt||Λt(δ0)),

and

S(Λt(ρ0)||Λt(δ0)) = S(ρ0||δ0).

(8)

(9)

Equation (8) indicates that Λt(δ0) is just the diagonal
part of the density matrix ρt = Λt(ρ0), while Eq. (9)
shows that the equality for the contractivity of relative
entropy in Eq. (5) is attained. Hereafter, we will use δt
to denote the diagonal part of the density matrix ρt for
simplicity. The above discussion implies that δt = Λt(δ0).
Second, we demonstrate that there exists an incoher-
ent operation Rt such that Rt(ρt) = ρ0 and Rt(δt) = δ0.
According to the well-known result about the contractiv-
[46–48], we have
ity of relative entropy given in Refs.
that Eq. (9) is valid if and only if there exists a CPTP
map Rt such that

Rt(ρt) = ρ0, Rt(δt) = δ0.

(10)

We therefore only need to prove that this CPTP map is
incoherent. In the case that δt is invertible, a CPTP map
satisfying Eq. (10) can be explicitly expressed as

Rt(ρ) = X

t Iδ− 1

easy to verify that ˜Kn(t)I ˜K†n(t) ⊂ I. Hence, Eq. (11)
deﬁnes an incoherent CPTP map satisfying Eq. (10). In
the case that δt is not invertible, instead of Eq. (11), Rt
can be written as

by (δ− 1
6= 0, and (δ− 1
)ii = 0 if
(δt)ii = 0. Similarly, we can show that the Rt deﬁned in
(12) is an incoherent CPTP map, and satisﬁes Eq. (10).
Third, with the above arguments, it is ready to obtain
the conclusion C(ρt) = C(ρ0). By combining the two
incoherent operations Λt and Rt, there is

if (δt)ii

(13)

Since all the coherence measures C have the monotonic-
ity of coherence measure under incoherent CPTP map,
expressed by the postulate (C2), Eq. (13) results in

C(ρ0) ≥ C(ρt) ≥ C(ρ0),

(14)

which implies that C(ρt) = C(ρ0). This completes the
proof of our theorem.

The theorem means that all measures of coherence are
frozen for an initial state in a strictly incoherent channel
if and only if the relative entropy of coherence is frozen
for the state. It provides an entropy-based criterion for
identifying the states with measure-independent freezing
of coherence, and is applicable to all strictly incoherent
channels.

t with Kraus operators K α

t ⊗ Λ2
n2⊗···⊗K N

It is worth noting that all the typical qubit noisy
channels [1],
such as the bit ﬂip, phase ﬂip, bit-
phase ﬂip, depolarizing, phase damping, and ampli-
tude damping channels, belong to this class of chan-
nels.
It is easy to verify that all the Kraus operators
describing these channels satisfy both Kn(t)IK†n(t) ⊂
I and K†n(t)IKn(t) ⊂ I. Furthermore,
if N chan-
nels Λα
n (t), α = 1, 2, . . . , N ,
are strictly incoherent channels, then the local chan-
nel Λt = Λ1
t ⊗ ··· ⊗ ΛN
is also a strictly inco-
herent channel with its Kraus operators Kn1n2...nN =
nN satisfying Kn1n2...nNIK†n1n2...nN ⊂
n1⊗K 1
K 1
I and K†n1n2...nNIKn1n2...nN ⊂ I. Note that here
Λ1
t , Λ2
t need not be identical, i.e., they may be
diﬀerent noisy channels. In fact, Kn(t)IK†n(t) ⊂ I means
that there is at most one nonzero entry in each column of
Kn, while K†n(t)IKn(t) ⊂ I means that there is at most
one nonzero entry in each row of Kn. Therefore, a chan-
nel is a strictly incoherent channel if and only if at most
one nonzero entry appears in each row and each column
of its Kraus operators with respect to the ﬁxed reference
basis. This provides a simple approach to identify strictly
incoherent channels, by which it is very easy to conﬁrm
that all the local channels consisting of strictly incoher-
ent channels are strictly incoherent channels. Hence our
theorem is applicable to all local channels consisting of
the typical qubit noisy channels.

t , . . . , ΛN

Our theorem can help to eﬀectively identify the states
with measure-independent freezing of coherence in a
strictly incoherent channel. All the states can be ob-
tained only by solving the equation Cr(Λt(ρ0)) = Cr(ρ0),
although it may be diﬃcult to solve analytically the equa-
tion to obtain the whole solutions since the calculation of
entropy is complicated. However, in general, it is unnec-
essary to obtain all the solutions. In quantum informa-
tion processing, researchers are usually interested only in
some special states, such as the Bell states, GHZ states,
and some other special families of states. In this case,
we only need to examine the desired states, to which our
theorem is quite useful.

As an example, we now apply our theorem to local bit
ﬂip channels to show the measure-independent freezing
phenomenon of coherence. Consider an N -qubit system
undergoing a local bit ﬂip channel Λt = Λ1
q1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ ΛN
qN ,
where Λα

√qασ1, and q1, . . . , qN are parameters dependent on time
t.

We ﬁrst examine a family of pure states, deﬁned by

|ϕ±l1l2...lNi = |l1l2 . . . lNi ± |¯l1¯l2 . . . ¯lNi

√2

,

(15)

where l1 = 0, li6=1 = 0, 1, and ¯li = NOT(li) = 1 − li.
These states are widely used in quantum information pro-
cessing. For instance, at N = 2, |ϕ±00i = |00i±|11i√2
and
|ϕ±01i = |01i±|10i√2
are just the Bell states, and at N ≥ 3,
00...0i = |0i⊗N +|1i⊗N
|ϕ+
are just the N -qubit GHZ states.
√2
We will show that all coherence measures for each of the
states in Eq. (15) are frozen.

Hereafter, we use l (¯l) to denote the sequence l1l2 . . . lN
(¯l1¯l2 . . . ¯lN ) for simplicity. The expression in Eq.
(15)
can then be simply written as |ϕ±l i = |li±|¯li√2
. According
to our theorem, we only need to show that the relative
entropy Cr(ρ±t,l) are constants, where ρ±t,l = Λt(ρ±0,l) with
ρ±0,l = |ϕ±l ihϕ±l | being the initial states.

By detail calculations, we obtain

ρ±t,l = X

Equation (16) shows that the relative entropy of coher-
ence for each state ρ±t,l is constant, and therefore all coher-
ence measures manifest freezing forever for the N -qubit

system initially in the states expressed by Eq. (15) under-
going local bit ﬂip channels. The measure-independent
freezing occurs in this case.

We now extend our discussion to a family of mixed

(18)
where H(p) = −p log p − (1 − p) log(1 − p), being the bi-
nary Shannon entropy. Equation (18) shows that Cr(ρt)
is a constant, which implies that all coherence measures
manifest freezing forever for the N -qubit system initially
in the states expressed by Eq. (17) undergoing local bit
ﬂip channels, i.e., the measure-independent freezing oc-
curs.

Specially,

and pl = 1+(−1)w(l)c3

if we take N as even numbers and let
p = 1+c1
in our example, where
−1 ≤ c1, c3 ≤ 1 are two real number and w(l) is the
Hamming weight of |li, then Eq. (17) gives the states
discussed in Ref. [41], where the authors found that the

2N −1

coherence measures based on the bona ﬁde distance are
frozen in the local identical bit ﬂip channel Λt = Λ⊗N
.
Here, our example implies that in this case all coherence
measures, not limited to the bona ﬁde coherence mea-
sures, are frozen.

q

In conclusion, we have proved the theorem that all
measures of coherence are frozen for an initial state in
a strictly incoherent channel if and only if the relative
entropy of coherence is frozen for the state. Our ﬁnding
reveals the existence of measure-independent freezing of
coherence, and more importantly, provides an entropy-
based dynamical condition in which the coherence of an
open quantum system is totally unaﬀected by noise.

Our theorem is applicable to all strictly incoherent
channels, such as the typical channels including the bit
ﬂip, phase ﬂip, bit-phase ﬂip, depolarizing, phase damp-
ing, amplitude damping channels, and all the multiqubit
local noisy channels consisting of these typical qubit
channels. As an example, we have applied the theorem to
local bit ﬂip channels, and shown that there are a num-
ber of states including the Bell states, the GHZ states,
other pure states, and a family of mixed states, of which
all coherence measures are frozen.

In passing, we would like to add that the relative en-
tropy of coherence plays a crucial role in the theorem.
We do not ﬁnd other coherence measures which can take
the place of the relative entropy in the theorem.
