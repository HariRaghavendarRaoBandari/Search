Density and structural anomalies in soft-repulsive
dimeric ﬂuids†
Gianmarco Munaó∗a and Franz Saijab

We report Monte Carlo results for the ﬂuid structure of a system of dimeric particles interacting
via a core-softened potential. More speciﬁcally, dimers interact through a repulsive pair potential
of inverse-power form, modiﬁed in such a way that the repulsion strength is softened in a given
range of distances. The aim of such a study is to investigate how both the elongation of the
dimers and the softness of the potential affect some features of the model. Our results show that
the dimeric ﬂuid exhibits both density and structural anomalies even if the interaction is not char-
acterized by two length scales. Upon increasing the aspect ratio of the dimers, such anomalies
are progressively hindered, with the structural anomaly surviving even after the disappearance
of the density anomaly. These results shed light on the peculiar behaviour of molecular systems
of non-spherical shape, showing how geometrical and interaction parameters play a fundamental
role for the presence of anomalies.

1 Introduction
The class of systems known as network-forming ﬂuids, i.e. ﬂu-
ids characterized by intermolecular bonds strictly dependent by
the orientation, has always captured great interest in the ﬁeld
of chemical physics. Some well-known examples of such com-
pounds, like water 1–4, carbon 5, phosphorous 6 and silica 7, have
been deeply investigated because of their so-called anomalous
behaviours, including re-entrant melting, diffusion and density
anomalies. Water, in particular, is still object of rather intense ex-
perimental 8–10 and theoretical 11–14 investigations for its anoma-
lous properties that deeply inﬂuence its phase behaviour, even
giving rise to a possible liquid-liquid critical point.
In this con-
text, the possibility to develop simple models able to reproduce
such thermodynamics anomalies even via spherically symmetric
potentials constitutes a fascinating challenge; in the last years, a
rich variety of models, based on some speciﬁc choices of the inter-
action potential, have been proposed to this aim. One of the ﬁrst
studies is due to Jagla 15, who introduced a particular model for
the intermolecular interaction by setting a short-range hard-core
plus a linear repulsive shoulder at larger distances. The resulting
phase diagram showed anomalous properties similar to those ob-
served in water. The Jagla potential belongs to a more general
class of intermolecular interactions called core-softened (CS) po-

tentials: ﬁrstly introduced by Hemmer and Stell in 1970 16 and
later recovered by Debenedetti and coworkers 17, these potentials
are characterized by the softening of the hard-core plus an attrac-
tive tail. It has been observed 16 that such a softening may cause
a second transition if a ﬁrst already exists. After these prelimi-
nary works, a large variety of investigations has been carried out
more recently to investigate the peculiar physical properties of
CS potentials: more speciﬁcally, attention has been paid to ther-
modynamic anomalies of the Hemmer-Stell potential 18,19 and of
the Jagla potential 20–22, as well as to liquid-liquid phase transi-
tion 23–29 and waterlike anomalies in CS potentials 30–37. Also,
CS potentials have been adopted to simulate, in a coarse-grain
approach, the phase behaviour of water 38 and alcohols 39,40.

Such interactions are characterized by two competing, ex-
panded and compact, local arrangements of particles. This prop-
erty, although arising from simple isotropic interactions, effec-
tively mimics the behaviour of the much more complex network-
forming ﬂuids, where loose and compact local structures arise
from the continuous formation and disruption of the dynamic
network originated by orientational bonds. Recently, the two-
scale picture as a requisite for anomalous behaviours has been
challenged by some studies showing that even a weak softening
of the repulsive interparticle interaction, though not able to yield
two distinct length scales, may nevertheless give origin to anoma-
lous behaviours 41,42.

In this study we investigate the ﬂuid phase of a model com-
posed by dimeric particles interacting via a modiﬁed inverse-
power potential (MIP) 43 by performing extensive Monte Carlo

(MC) simulations in the canonical ensemble.
In previous
works 43,44 it has been shown that a system of spherical particles
interacting through MIP can display typical water-like anomalies
by varying carefully the softening parameter of the interparticle
potential. Such an approach allows one to follow the crossover
from one-scale behaviour characterizing Lennard-Jones-like ﬂu-
ids to a two-scale behaviour typical of CS potential systems. Here
we generalize this approach by considering symmetric dimers of
variable aspect ratio, modeled as two partially fused spheres in-
teracting with the spheres of an other dimer via the MIP poten-
tial. Starting with the monomeric case we progressively increase
the aspect ratio with the aim to investigate how some anoma-
lous behaviours are inﬂuenced by the red elongated shape of the
molecules. At the same time, the two different conditions corre-
sponding to one and two length scales of the potential are taken
into account.
In a previous study by de Oliveira and cowork-
ers 45 the authors studied a model consisting of dimeric molecules
which interact through a intermolecular continuous shoulder po-
tential, but they limited their analysis to a single value of the
aspect ratio.

The novelty of our study relies in the attempt to relate both the
geometry of the system and the speciﬁc form of the interaction
potential to the onset of anomalies in molecular non-spherical
ﬂuids, with a possible application to a wide range of soft systems.
The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we pro-
vide details of the model and the simulation approach. Results
are presented and discussed in the third section and conclusions
follow in the last section.
2 Model and simulations
The sequence of models investigated in this work is schemati-
cally depicted in Fig. 1: starting from two spheres totally over-
lapped we progressively increase the distance from their centres,
decreasing the overlapping volume. In this way we obtain dimers
comprised by two spherical particles rigidly bonded together. If
we indicate the aspect ratio λ as the distance between the two

centers of the spheres, we move from λ = 0 (total overlap) to
λ = 0.40. In this range, each value attained by λ is smaller than
the radius σ /2 of the spheres constituting the dimers (σ being the
diameter). The interaction site-site potential is set as:

U(r) = ε(σ /r)n(r)

(1)

where ε and σ are the units of energy and length, respectively,
and

n(r) = n0{1− α exp[−b(1− r/σ )2]}

(2)

In this equation, α is a real number between 0 and 1 and b and n0
are positive integer numbers. Also, we deﬁne reduced tempera-
ture, density and pressure as, respectively, T∗ ≡ kBT /ε, ρ∗ ≡ ρσ 3
and P∗ ≡ Pσ 3/ε, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.

In Eqs. 1-2, introduced and investigated in Refs. 43,44, α takes
into account the repulsion softening, while b controls the width
of the interval where n(r) is smaller than n0.
In the following,
we keep ﬁxed b = 5 and n0 = 12 and investigate the two different
cases corresponding to α = 0.6 and α = 0.8. The behaviour of
U(r) for these two cases is also reported in Fig. 1: one can no-
tice that for α = 0.6, the potential essentially follows an inverse-
power law, whereas for α = 0.8 there is an inﬂection point with

several isotherms for λ = 0.1 and α = 0.6 (a) and 0.8 (b).

a change of the concavity. As demonstrated in a previous work
on monomeric particles interacting via the same potential of the
model at issue 43, for α = 0.6 the potential exhibits one length
scale, whereas for α = 0.8 two distinct, repulsive length scales
emerge, giving rise to a competition between them. The condition
λ < σ /2 ensures that the effective global dimer-dimer interaction
preserves the same features of the site-site potential in terms of
one or two length scales.

In order to investigate the ﬂuid structure and to ascertain the
presence of possible anomalies of this system, we have carried out
standard Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the NVT ensemble. We
have kept ﬁxed the total number of dimers (N = 864) enclosed in
a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. As for the simula-
tion runs, for each investigated value of λ we have ﬁrst performed
a series of simulations at relatively high temperatures (speciﬁcally
T∗ = 0.40) upon progressively increasing the density from 0.2 to
1.0. Once obtained the equilibration, we have gradually cooled
the system with a ∆T step of 0.05. For each run we have per-
formed 2× 105 steps to equilibrate the system, then followed by
the same number of steps to collect statistical properties. At low
temperatures we have extended the number of steps up to 5×105
in order to ensure a proper equilibration even in such conditions.

3 Results
We ﬁrst remind that in the monomeric case, corresponding to
λ = 0, density and structural anomalies have been observed for
both α = 0.6 and α = 0.8 43,44. The density anomaly indicates
an unusual expansion of the system upon cooling, with the den-
sity increasing till to reach a maximum and then decreasing. The
structural anomaly is instead characterized by the unusual be-
haviour of the pair translational entropy S2 deﬁned as 46:
dr[gcm(r)lngcm(r)− gcm(r) + 1]

(cid:90)

(3)

S2/kB = − 1

ρ

where gcm(r) is the pair distribution function between the centers
of mass of two dimers. This quantity effectively characterizes the
degree of pair translational order present in the ﬂuid 47. At vari-
ance with a simple ﬂuid, −S2 has a a non-monotonic behaviour
for systems interacting through a CS potential.

The presence of these anomalies for both the values of α in the
monomeric case suggests that the onset of anomalous behaviours
in MIP ﬂuids is not stricly connected with the double length scale
of the potential (attained at α = 0.8) but it may be found even if
the potential exhibits only one length scale (as, for instance, at

α = 0.6). However, in the latter case, anomalies are more difﬁ-
cult to ﬁnd and very extensive and careful simulations need to
be performed to locate them. The effect of increasing λ is ex-
pected to further inﬂuence the structural and thermodynamic be-
haviour of the system; we shall see in the follow how the balance
between aspect ratio and length scales of the potential is respon-
sible of the onset or disappearance of anomalous behaviours in
MIP dimer ﬂuids. Also, following the prescription suggested by
de Oliveira and coworkers in their previous investigation of wa-
terlike anomalies in dimer systems 45, pressure and temperature
shall be rescaled by a factor of 4 if λ (cid:54)= 0. This is to guarantee a
better comparison with the monomeric case (λ = 0), where the ef-
fective intermolecular interaction between particles is four times
weaker.

We report in Fig. 2 the behaviour of the density as a function of
the temperature at a given pressure; more speciﬁcally, we show
results for α = 0.6, λ = 0.05 and P∗ = 3.75 in panel (a), while
data for α = 0.8, λ = 0.2 and P∗ = 2.75 are reported in panel (b).
Both the two curves display a maximum of ρ∗ upon increasing T∗,
followed by a rapid decay; this scenario testiﬁes the presence of a
temperature of maximum density (TMD), whose value is strictly
dependent on the particular pressure considered. We anticipate
that the increase of λ tends to hinder the development of this
density anomaly; speciﬁcally, the higher values of λ where a TMD
is still observed are 0.05 for α = 0.6 and 0.30 for α = 0.8.

Results for the pair translational entropy as a function of the

4 |

1–6

density for α = 0.6 and 0.8 at the same λ = 0.1 are reported,
respectively, in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 3. At high values of
T∗, S2 monotonically increases with ρ∗ and no anomalies are ob-
served. Upon decreasing the temperature, the behaviour of S2
ceases to be monotonic and shows the presence of a maximum
and a minimum more and more structured. This feature is clear
especially for α = 0.8 (Fig. 3b) but it is observed, albeit in a less
extent, for α = 0.6 also (Fig. 3a). The non-monotonic behaviour
of S2 is usually related to the presence of a structural anomaly in
the ﬂuid 48; as a consequence, such a kind of anomaly, already
observed for both α = 0.6 and α = 0.8 in the monomeric case,
survives for α = 0.6 even if λ = 0.1, where the density anomaly is
disappeared.

The speciﬁc values of maxima and minima deﬁne a portion of
the temperature-pressure plane corresponding to the structural
anomaly region. At the same time, values attained by TMD deﬁne,
in the same plane, the density anomaly region. In Fig. 4 we show
these two regions for α = 0.6 and λ = 0 (a) and λ = 0.05 (b). As
visible, the small increase of λ is enough to shrink both structural
and density anomaly regions. Actually, a maximum and a mini-
mum in S2 can be hardly detected for λ = 0.05 if T∗ < 0.13; this is
due to the development of solid-like features in gcm(r) that cause
a sharp increase of the correspondig pair translational entropy. As
a consequence, the proﬁle of S2 vs ρ∗ shows discontinuities pre-
venting the detection of maxima and minima in these functions.
These circumstances suggest that the shrink of anomalies regions

two distinct arrangements between dimers become possible, with
the one corresponding to the ﬁrst peak in gcm(r) more favored
upon increasing the density. However, despite the differences in
the gcm(r), structural and density anomalies are both observed
in the two thermodynamic state points considered in Fig. 6 (see
Fig 4 and Fig 5).

The overall behaviour of these anomalies as a function of α
and λ is schematically summarized in Table 1: in particular, the
effect of progressively increase the aspect ratio when the poten-
tial has one or two length scale is enlightened, at the same time
enhancing the persistence of the structural anomaly when TMD
disappears.
4 Conclusions
We have investigated the ﬂuid phase of a model of dimers in-
teracting through a core-softened potential by means of Monte
Carlo simulations with a particular focus on their density and
structural anomalies. Speciﬁcally, two dimers interact via a mod-
iﬁed inverse-power potential (MIP), i.e. a repulsive potential of
inverse-power form modiﬁed to soften the repulsion strength in
a range of distances. We have considered two different condi-
tions, corresponding to one (α = 0.6) and two (α = 0.8) length
scales of the intermolecular potential, analyzing how the increase
of the aspect ratio λ of the dimers inﬂuences their anomalous be-
haviour. In the spherically-symmetric case (i.e. λ = 0) density and
structural anomalies have been observed in both cases already in
previous works 43,44: here we have found that a small increase of
λ (from 0 to 0.05) allows for the persistence of such anomalies
at α = 0.6. Upon further increasing λ , the density anomaly disap-
pears, whereas the structural anomaly is still found for λ = 0.10.
As for the two-length scale case, both anomalies survive till to
λ = 0.30; beyond this value, no density anomaly is observed, with
the structural anomaly persisting for λ = 0.40.

The ﬂuid structure of MIP dimers has been investigated through
the radial distribution function gcm(r) that shows different be-
haviours for the two investigated values of α. In particular, the
development of a double-peak structure for α = 0.8 is strongly
reminiscent of the two-length scale of the intermolecular poten-
tial. Such a feature is not observed for α = 0.6, even if density
and structural anomalies are present. These ﬁndings suggest that
the development of such anomalies in CS systems is not strictly
dependent on the double length scale of the potential; moreover

may be ascribed to an increase of the solid region with respect to
the monomeric case.

Regions of structural and density anomalies for α = 0.8 at var-
ious λ are reported in Fig. 5. The effect of increasing the aspect
ratio is now reﬂected in the lowering of the temperature where
the anomalies are observed. That is, the dimer system needs to
be more and more cooled before showing anomalous behaviour;
if λ > 0.3, the density anomaly is no more observed, whereas the
structural anomaly, which develops at higher temperature, is still
found.

Finally, the ﬂuid structure of MIP dimers is investigated in
Fig. 6, where results for gcm(r) as a function of the density for
T∗ = 0.15 and α = 0.6 (a) and 0.8 (b) are reported. When the po-
tential exhibits only one length scale (panel (a)), the progressive
increase of ρ∗ causes the shift of the ﬁrst peak of gcm(r) towards
low values of r/σ. This is due to the lower typical distance be-
tween two dimers (λ = 0.05 in this case) when the system is com-
pressed. A different behaviour is observed for α = 0.8 and λ = 0.1
(panel (b)): now, a double peak is clearly observed in gcm(r) if
ρ∗ ≥ 0.60. This feature is due to the presence of a double length
scale in the potential, actually attained for α = 0.8. In this case,

Journal Name, [year], [vol.],the increase of the aspect ratio of the dimers tends to suppress
the anomalies in a way depending on the speciﬁc combination of
α and λ .

Our results pave the way for a more general investigation of
CS non-spherical systems, enlightening the role played by the
anisotropy in affecting their phase behaviour. Such systems may
include, for instance, elongated molecules, polymers and col-
loidal dimers, whose experimental realization 49,50 along with
theoretical models 51,52 are currently object of increasing inter-
est.
