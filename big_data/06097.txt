Abstract

The detachment of a semi-ordered monolayer of polystyrene microspheres adhered to an

aluminum-coated glass substrate is studied using a laser-induced spallation technique. The

microsphere-substrate adhesion force is estimated from substrate surface displacement mea-

surements obtained using optical interferometry, and a rigid-body model that accounts for the

inertia of the microspheres. The estimated adhesion force is compared with estimates ob-

tained from interferometric measurement of the out-of-plane microsphere contact resonance.

Reasonable agreement is found between the two experiments. Scanning electron microscope

images of detached monolayer regions reveal a unique morphology, namely, partially detached

monolayer ﬂakes composed of single hexagonal close packed crystalline domains. This work

contributes to an improved understanding of microsphere adhesion and demonstrates a unique

monolayer delamination morphology.

Introduction

Microparticle adhesion is central to fundamental areas such as surface science,1 geological ma-

terial mechanics,2 granular media dynamics,3 and even planet formation.4 Improved understand-

ing of microparticle adhesion has implications for applied areas including self-assembly,5 laser

cleaning of semiconductors,6 powder processing,2,7 and drug delivery.8 One method to study mi-

croparticle adhesion is to use laser-generated acoustic waves to eject the particles from a surface.

This method has previously been used to study the adhesion of disordered assemblies of particles

adhered to substrates.9,10 A closely related technique, which is typically used to study interfacial

adhesion of thin ﬁlms, is laser-induced spallation,11 wherein, a laser-generated acoustic compres-

sion pulse reﬂects from the free surface of the sample as a tensile pulse that causes delamination

near the surface.

In this work, we study the delamination of semi-ordered microsphere monolayers adhered to an

aluminum-coated glass substrate, which contains both hexagonal close packed (HCP) and disor-

dered domains, using a laser-induced spallation technique. The particle-substrate adhesive force is

estimated by monitoring the time-resolved displacements of the surface of a substrate without the

microsphere monolayer via optical inteferometry, and applying a rigid-body model that accounts

for the microsphere inertia. We compare the estimated adhesive force with estimations based on

measurements of the out-of-plane contact resonance of the microspheres obtained using optical

inteferometry.3 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the delaminated monolayer areas

reveal a unique morphology wherein the monolayer has fractured into ﬂakes that have partially

reattached to the substrate and are composed of mostly single crystalline domains.

Experimental Section

A schematic of the sample used in this study is shown in Fig. 1a. The substrate was purchased

from EMF Corp., and consists of a 1.5 mm thick glass slide coated with a 100 nm thick aluminum

ﬁlm used to reﬂect light during the optical inteferometry measurements. A 400 nm thick aluminum

ﬁlm was applied on the opposite side via electron-beam evaporation in order to absorb the pump

pulse laser light. A 10 µm thick waterglass ﬁlm is deposited on the back of the 400 nm thick alu-

minum ﬁlm via spincoating, to increase the amplitude of bulk longitudinal waves traveling through

the substrate. A monolayer of 1 µm diameter polystyrene (PS) microspheres are assembled on the
top of the aluminum-coated substrate using a modiﬁed Langmuir-Blodgett technique,12 in which

the microspheres are self-assembled at an air-water interface and then transferred to the substrate.

This process results in a semi-ordered monolayer, with HCP crystalline domains of differing ori-

in the substrate, pump laser light is focused on the 400 nm aluminum layer. In all experiments, the

plane of the sample surface is oriented vertically.

In the laser-induced spallation experiments, the pump light (1064 nm wavelength, 5 ns pulse

duration) is focused to a spot size of approximately 2.5 mm diameter (determined by burn marks

on ZAP-IT paper). Since the excitation ablates the energy-absorbing aluminum layer, new mono-

layer positions are tested after each pump pulse. To calculate the force acting on the monolayer,

surface displacements are monitored with a Michelson interferometer, which consists of an argon

laser (514.5 nm wavelength, continuous wave) focused on the 100 nm aluminum layer and the

reference beam focused on a stationary mirror, to a spot with an estimated diameter of approxi-

mately 30 µm (at 1/e2 intensity level). Because the microspheres scatter the probe light, surface

displacements are recorded on a calibration sample that does not include a microsphere monolayer,

but is otherwise identical. Interferometer signals are measured with a photodetector of 300 ps rise

time (Electro-Optics Technology, model ET-2030) and digitized on a 5 GHz oscilloscope (Lecroy

Wavemaster 8500) at a sample rate of 20 Gsample/s. Surface displacements are obtained from the

interferometric signal using a fringe counting technique.11

Results and Discussion

Figure 1c shows an example of the measured surface displacements induced by a 36 mJ pump

pulse. We observe the arrival of an acoustic pulse of greater than 60 ns duration traveling at the

longitudinal sound speed in the glass. We obtain the acceleration of the substrate by numerically

differentiating the measured substrate displacement twice, and applying numerical smoothing to

the displacement, velocity, and acceleration signals.13 An example of such an acceleration proﬁle,

corresponding to a pump energy of 36 mJ, is shown in Fig. 1c.

To calculate the force acting at the particle-substrate contact, we employ a simple model that

accounts for the inertia of the microspheres and considers the microspheres to be rigid bodies

that follow the substrate surface motion until detachment.9 We calculate the force applied to the

contact as F = ma, where m is the microsphere mass, calculated using a density provided by

the manufacturer (Corpuscular, Inc.) of 1.06 g/m3, and a is the measured substrate acceleration.

This type of model is valid when the pulse duration is signiﬁcantly longer than the period of the

microsphere contact resonance (a vibrational mode where the microsphere moves like a rigid body,

but has localized deformation around the point of contact that acts as a spring14). If the maximum

tensile force induced at the contact exceeds the adhesive force, microsphere detachment occurs.

The maximum tensile force obtained from the acceleration proﬁle is plotted against pump energy

in Fig. 2. The lowest pump energy where we observed microsphere detachment was at 36 mJ, so

we identify the detachment threshold to be between 36 mJ and the next lowest pump energy, 34 mJ.
This corresponds to an adhesive force, averaged between 34 mJ and 36 mJ, of Fspall = 2.2± 0.4
µN. The magnitude of the error bars in Fig. 2 is the maximum of the difference between the
smoothed and unsmoothed acceleration signals, multiplied by the microsphere mass.13 As such,

we note that the amplitude of the error bars do not account for inaccuracies that may result from

fast changes in the substrate motion and the use of the inertial model, for instance, in the case of

resonant particle removal where the rigid body assumption no longer holds.

After the spallation experiments, the sample is examined using a SEM. Images of the post-

spallation monolayer are shown for different pump energies in Fig. 3. A monolayer region tested

with a pump energy of 34 mJ is shown in Fig. 3a, and appears similar to the untested region, with

no evidence of microsphere detachment. When the pump energy is slightly increased to 36 mJ,

noticeable gaps in the monolayer are observed, as is shown in Fig. 3b. At a pump energy of 50

mJ, the amount of monolayer delamination increases, as can be seen in Fig. 3c. Since the adhesive

force is expected to have a statistical variation throughout the monolayer,15 it is not surprising that

some patches of monolayer remain adhered to the surface near the onset of microsphere removal.

We also observe that detached monolayer ﬂakes resettle on the sample surface. Resettling of

ejected particles has been observed previously by others,9 despite the plane of the sample’s surface

being oriented vertically. This was explained by the slowing of ejected particles by the Stokes

drag in air, while long range attractive forces eventually cause some particles to re-adhere to the

surface.9

We ﬁnd that almost all of the delaminated ﬂakes are composed of single HCP crystalline do-

mains. We suggest that fracture of the monolayer into ﬂakes is the result of interparticle decohesion

along the weak boundaries that develop during the spallation process. In previous spallation exper-

iments with continuous, ductile thin ﬁlms, the excessive stress tended to lead to large scale plastic

deformation in the ﬁlm manifested by “blister” formation following the ﬁlm delamination.16 We

speculate that the ordering of the monolayer ﬂakes is due to stronger interparticle cohesion for

HCP regions than disordered regions.

onance. The sample is the same as in Fig. 1a. (b) Measured signal. (c) Fourier spectrum of
(b).

We compare the adhesion force obtained from the laser-induced spallation experiments with

that estimated from the out-of-plane microsphere contact resonance measured on a different region

of the same sample. To excite the contact resonance, we generate a bulk longitudinal acoustic pulse

using a conﬁguration similar to the spallation experiment, but at an amplitude signiﬁcantly below

the microsphere detachment threshold, as shown in Fig. 4a. The out-of-plane contact resonance

is excited upon arrival of the longitudinal wave, while the horizontal-rotational resonances17 are

not excited due to symmetry constraints. Out-of-plane displacements of the microspheres are

measured using a grating interferometer,18 wherein a probe beam focused on the microspheres

and a reference beam is focused on a stationary region of the sample. Probe and reference beams

(514 nm wavelength, continuous wave) are both focused to a diameter of 80 µm (at 1/e2 intensity

level), while the pump (532 nm, 430 ps pulse duration, 4 µJ per pulse) is focused to a diameter of
240 µm (at 1/e2 intensity level). The interferometric signal is measured with a photodetector of 500

ps rise time (Electro-Optics Technology, model ET-2030A), digitized with a 2.5 GHz oscilloscope

7

(Tektronix DPO 7245C) at a sample rate of 5 Gsamples/s, and low-pass ﬁltered with a cutoff

frequency of 500 MHz. Using this setup, we obtain the signal shown in Fig. 4b. The signal exhibits

oscillations that begin when the bulk longitudinal acoustic wave arrives at the surface containing

the microsphere monolayer. The Fourier spectrum of this signal is shown in Fig. 4c, and has a clear

peak at f0 = 140 MHz. We relate the resonant frequency to the contact stiffness by assuming the

spheres act as a spring mass oscillator with resonant frequency f0, such that f0 = 1/2π(cid:112)Kc/m. By

linearizing the Hertzian contact model around the equilibrium contact area, we obtain the adhesive
force in terms of the contact stiffness, Kc, such that FCR = (2Kc/3)3/RK2, where FCR is the adhesive
force, K is the effective modulus, deﬁned as K = [(3/4)(((1− ν2
l )/El))]−1, and
R is the effective radius of curvature of the contact (equal to the microsphere radius for spherical-

s )/Es) + ((1− ν2

planar contact geometry).19 The effective modulus K is expressed in terms of Young’s modulus, E,

and Poisson’s ratio, ν, and the subscripts s and l denote the sphere and the substrate, respectively.

Using elastic properties of Young’s modulus El = 62 GPa and Poisson’s ratio νl = 0.24 for the
aluminum layer,20 and Es = 4.04 GPa and νs = 0.32 for the PS microspheres,21 we ﬁnd an adhesive
force of FCR = 1.5 µN.

Using the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov model for adhered microparticles,22,23 we calculate an
adhesive force of FDMT = 2πwR = 0.36 µN, where w = 0.113 J/m2 is work of adhesion between
PS and alumina (assuming a native oxide layer).21 While the adhesion force obtained via the two

experiments have reasonable agreement, the adhesion estimated using DMT contact mechanics

is signiﬁcantly lower. Previous studies have similarly found larger than predicted contact stiff-

nesses.3,21 Uncertainties in the work of adhesion between the PS microparticle and the aluminum-

coated substrate may contribute to the higher than predicted adhesion force. Particularly in the

case of reactive metals, such as aluminum, higher values of work of adhesion have been observed

than are predicted by van der Waals adhesion models.24 Utilizing the DMT contact model and the

adhesion force obtained from the laser-induced spallation experiments, we obtain a work of adhe-

sion of 0.8 J/m2, which is reasonable considering past studies on dielectric-metal adhesion.24 By

observing PS microspheres adhered to substrates via SEM, previous studies have found the contact

8

radius to be larger than predicted by elastic contact models,25,26 which can also result in higher

adhesive forces.27,28

Summary and Conclusions

This work provides data regarding the adhesion, contact mechanics, and delamination of micro-

sphere monolayers. The unique monolayer ﬂakes may ﬁnd future application in laser-induced

particle transfer applications,29 and provide an opportunity to study the in-plane fracture mechan-

ics of microsphere monolayers. The microsphere monolayer studied in this work represents a

microscale analog of a macroscale granular crystal.30 While many studies have shown macroscale

granular crystals to exhibit rich physics, the study of their microscale counterparts is an emerging

ﬁeld.31 This work paves the way for the study of spallation and highly nonlinear phenomena in

three-dimensional microscale granular crystals. Related laser-induced spallation techniques gener-

ating shear32 or mixed-mode16 elastic waves may be useful to study the shear strength of adhered

microparticles, or the propagation of rotational modes in three dimensional microscale granular

crystals. Rotational modes have only recently been observed in three-dimensional macroscale33

and two-dimensional microscale granular crystals.3 Finally, the microparticle adhesion measure-

ments obtained as part of this study may ﬁnd future use in self-assembly, laser cleaning, powder

processing, or drug delivery applications.
