Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate
self-dual representations of GL(n) and the local

Jacquet-Langlands correspondence

Yoichi Mieda

Abstract. We determine the parity of the Langlands param-
eter of a conjugate self-dual supercuspidal representation of
GL(n) over a non-archimedean local ﬁeld by means of the local
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. It gives a partial general-
ization of a previous result on the self-dual case by Prasad and
Ramakrishnan.

Introduction

Let F be a p-adic ﬁeld. By the local Langlands correspondence, irreducible smooth
representations of GLn(F ) are known to be parameterized by n-dimensional repre-
sentations of WF ×SL2(C), where WF denotes the Weil group of F . For an irreducible
smooth representation π of GLn(F ), we write recF (π) for the attached parameter,
which is called the Langlands parameter of π.

Let us assume that π is self-dual, namely, π is isomorphic to its contragredient
π∨. Since recF is compatible with dual, recF (π) is again self-dual. Therefore we
can consider the problem whether recF (π) is symplectic or orthogonal, under the
condition that recF (π) is irreducible, in other words, π is a discrete series represen-
tation. In [PR12], Prasad and Ramakrishnan answered this question by means of
the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Let D be a central division algebra of
rank n over F . Recall that the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence ([Rog83],
[DKV84]) gives a bijection between isomorphism classes of irreducible discrete series
representations of GLn(F ) and those of irreducible smooth representations of D×.
We write JL(π) for the representation of D× attached to π by this correspondence.
The theorem of Prasad and Ramakrishnan is as follows:

Theorem 1.1 ([PR12, Theorem B]) Assume that π is self-dual.
If n is odd,
recF (π) is always orthogonal (this part is clear). If n is even, then recF (π) is sym-
plectic (resp. orthogonal) if and only if JL(π) is orthogonal (resp. symplectic).

The purpose of this paper is to extend this theorem to the conjugate self-dual
setting. Let F/F + be a quadratic extension of p-adic ﬁelds and τ the generator of
Gal(F/F +). A smooth representation (π, V ) of GLn(F ) is said to be conjugate self-
dual if πτ ∼= π∨, where πτ denotes the representation GLn(F ) τ−→ GLn(F ) π−→ GL(V ).
If π is conjugate self-dual, its Langlands parameter recF (π) is also conjugate self-dual
in the following sense. Take c ∈ WF + \ WF . For a representation φ of WF × SL2(C),
deﬁne a new representation φc by φc(w) = φ(cwc−1); it is independent of the choice of
c up to isomorphism. A representation φ is said to be conjugate self-dual if φc ∼= φ∨
holds. For an irreducible conjugate self-dual representation φ of WF × SL2(C), we
can deﬁne its parity Cφ ∈ {±1} in the similar way as in the self-dual case (for the
detail, see [GGP12, §3], [Mok15, §2.2] and Section 2 of this paper). If Cφ = 1, φ is
said to be conjugate orthogonal, otherwise conjugate symplectic. For an irreducible
conjugate self-dual discrete series representation π, the parity of recF (π) knows
whether π comes from the standard base change lifting or the twisted base change
lifting from the quasi-split unitary group UF/F +(n) (see [Mok15, §2]).

In this paper, we determine the parity of recF (π) by means of JL(π), under the

conditions that

– F/F + is at worst tamely ramiﬁed,
– the invariant of D is 1/n,
– and π is supercuspidal (in other words, recF (π) is trivial on the SL2(C)-factor).
Under the ﬁrst two assumptions, we construct explicitly an automorphism τ : D× →
D× such that τ |F × coincides with τ ∈ Gal(F/F +), and t ∈ D× such that τ 2(d) =
tdt−1 for d ∈ D× (Deﬁnition 2.10). For such a pair (τ, t), we can deﬁne the conjugate
self-duality and the parity of an irreducible smooth representation of D× (see Section
2). Our main theorem is summarized as follows:

Theorem 1.2 (Main theorem, Theorem 2.12) Assume that F/F + is at worst
tamely ramiﬁed and the invariant of D is 1/n. Let π be an irreducible conjugate
self-dual supercuspidal representation of GLn(F ). Then, JL(π) is conjugate self-dual
with respect to (τ, t), and its parity CJL(π) satisﬁes

CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1CJL(π).

Theorems 1.1, 1.2 are useful in the study of recF (π), because the determination of
JL(π) is usually much easier than that of recF (π). In Section 4, we apply Theorems
1.1, 1.2 to compute the parity of recF (π) for conjugate (or usual) self-dual simple
supercuspidal representations of GLn(F ) (for simple supercuspidal representations,
see [GR10], [RY14], [KL15]). For example, we prove that the Langlands parameter
of a self-dual simple supercuspidal representation of GL2n(F ) is symplectic if and
only if its central character is trivial. This result plays a crucial role in the recent
study of Oi [Oi16a] on the endoscopic lifting of simple supercuspidal representations
of SO2n+1(F ) to GL2n(F ).

Let us explain the strategy of our proof of Theorem 1.2. We use a geometric
method. The non-abelian Lubin-Tate theory ([Car90], [Boy99], [HT01]) tells us

2

Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate self-dual representations

that the correspondences recF and JL for supercuspidal representations appear in
the ℓ-adic ´etale cohomology of the Lubin-Tate tower, which is a projective system
of universal deformation spaces of a one-dimensional formal OF -module X of height
n with suitable level structures. By using the cup product of the cohomology and a
result in [Mie10], we can construct a perfect pairing

(JL(π) ⊠ recF (π)) × (JL(π∨) ⊠ recF (π∨)) → C

for an irreducible supercuspidal representation π of GLn(F ). It enables us to com-
pare the parity of recF (π) and that of JL(π), provided that π is self-dual. As in
the introduction of [PR12], this method had already been found by Fargues; he
announced the supercuspidal case of Theorem 1.1 in [Far06, §5] without proof. The
new point of this paper is to adapt the argument above to the conjugate self-dual
case. In the conjugate self-dual case, we need to make the pairing “Hermitian”. For
this purpose, we introduce a new operator on the Lubin-Tate tower, which we call
the twisting operator. In the deﬁnition of it, we need to ﬁx an additional structure
on the ﬁxed formal OF -module X. This extra structure naturally induces the pair
(τ, t) in Theorem 1.2, as D× can be identiﬁed with the group of self-OF -isogenies of
X.

Since our method is geometric, our theorem is also valid in the equal character-
istic case. On the other hand, we need to assume that the invariant of D is 1/n and
π is supercuspidal, because this is the only case in which recF (π) and JL(π) have
nice geometric descriptions. The author expects that Theorem 1.2 is true for any
conjugate self-dual discrete series representation π; in fact, we can easily verify it for
a character twist of the Steinberg representation (see Remark 2.13). It seems also
an interesting question to extend Theorem 1.2 to general division algebras. These
problems will be considered in our future works.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we give some basic deﬁnitions
on conjugate self-dual representations and their parity. We need a slightly general
framework than usual, in order to formulate Theorem 1.2. Section 3 is devoted to
a proof of the main theorem. After a brief review of the non-abelian Lubin-Tate
theory, we introduce and study the twisting operator, which is a key of our proof.
To describe the pair (τ, t) explicitly, we also need some explicit computations of
Dieudonn´e modules.
In Section 4, we apply the main theorem to determine the
parity of conjugate self-dual simple supercuspidal representations of GLn(F ).

2 Parity of conjugate self-dual representations

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions and properties

Let G be a totally disconnected locally compact topological group. We ﬁx a contin-
uous automorphism τ : G → G and an element t ∈ G satisfying

τ 2 = Int(t),

τ (t) = t,

where Int(t) : G → G denotes the isomorphism g 7→ tgt−1. For a smooth repre-
sentation (π, V ) of G, we write (πτ , V ) for the smooth representation deﬁned by
πτ (g) = π(τ (g)). We say that π is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ if πτ is
isomorphic to the contragredient representation π∨. If π is conjugate self-dual with
respect to τ , we have π∨∨ ∼= (πτ )∨ = (π∨)τ ∼= (πτ )τ = πt ∼= π (the last isomorphism
is given by π(t)−1). Hence π is admissible.

Let π be a smooth representation of G which is conjugate self-dual with respect
to τ . Then, there exists a non-degenerate bilinear pairing h , i : V ×V → C satisfying
hπ(τ (g))x, π(g)yi = hx, yi for every g ∈ G and x, y ∈ V . If π is irreducible, such a
pairing is unique up to scalar by Schur’s lemma (recall that π is admissible).

Lemma 2.1 There exists Cπ ∈ {±1} such that hπ(t)y, xi = Cπhx, yi for every
x, y ∈ V .

Proof. Put hx, yi′ = hπ(t)y, xi. Let g ∈ G and x, y ∈ V be arbitrary elements, and
we put g′ = τ −1(g). Then we have

hπ(τ (g))x, π(g)yi′ = hπ(t)π(g)y, π(τ (g))xi = hπ(τ (tg′))y, π(tg′t−1)xi

= hy, π(t)−1xi = hπ(t)y, xi = hx, yi′.

Therefore there exists Cπ ∈ C× such that hx, yi′ = Cπhx, yi for every x, y ∈ V .

For x, y ∈ V , we have

hx, yi = hπ(τ (t))x, π(t)yi = hπ(t)x, π(t)yi = Cπhπ(t)y, xi = C 2

πhx, yi.

Hence we have C 2

π = 1. This concludes the proof.

Remark 2.2 The sign Cπ depends not only on τ but also on t. Let t′ ∈ G be
another element satisfying τ 2 = Int(t′). Then z = t′t−1 lies in the center of G and
ﬁxed by τ . It is immediate to see that Cπ for t′ equals ωπ(z)Cπ, where ωπ denotes
the central character of π.

We call Cπ the parity of π (with respect to (τ, t)). If Cπ = 1 (resp. Cπ = −1),
we say that π is conjugate orthogonal (resp. conjugate symplectic). If τ = id and
t = 1, this notion coincides with the standard one.

Remark 2.3 Consider the case where (π, V ) is ﬁnite-dimensional, and put m =
dimC V .

4

Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate self-dual representations

(i) Assume that m = 1, and identify V with C. Then, h , i : C×C → C; (x, y) 7→ xy
gives a non-degenerate bilinear pairing satisfying hπ(τ (g))x, π(g)yi = hx, yi.
From this pairing we can deduce Cπ = π(t).

(ii) Let h , i : V × V → C be a non-degenerate bilinear pairing as in the deﬁnition

of the parity. Put (det π, det V ) = (Vm π,Vm V ). Then, h , i induces a pairing

det V × det V → C by

hx1 ∧ · · · ∧ xm, y1 ∧ · · · ∧ ymi = Xσ∈Sm

sgn(σ)hx1, yσ(1)i · · · hxm, yσ(m)i.

It is non-degenerate and satisﬁes

h(det π)(τ (g))x, (det π)(g)yi = hx, yi,

h(det π)(t)y, xi = C m

π hx, yi

for x, y ∈ det V and g ∈ G. Hence we have Cdet π = C m
π .

In particular, if m is odd, the parity Cπ can be computed as follows:

Cπ = C m

π = Cdet π = det π(t).

In contrast, if m is even, the parity is a more subtle invariant.

We give two elementary lemmas.

Lemma 2.4 Assume that (G, τ, t) is decomposed into (G1 × G2, τ1 × τ2, (t1, t2)),
where Gi is a totally disconnected locally compact topological group, τi : Gi → Gi
a continuous automorphism and ti ∈ Gi satisfying τ 2
i = Int(ti). For each i = 1, 2,
let (πi, Vi) be an irreducible smooth representation of Gi conjugate self-dual with
respect to τi. Then, (π1 ⊠ π2, V1 ⊗ V2) is an irreducible smooth representation of G
conjugate self-dual with respect to τ , and Cπ1⊠π2 is equal to Cπ1Cπ2.

Proof. It is well-known that the exterior tensor product of irreducible admissible
representations is irreducible. The parity can be computed by using the pairing
hx1 ⊗ x2, y1 ⊗ y2i = hx1, y1i1hx2, y2i2, where h , ii : Vi × Vi → C is an appropriate
pairing attached to πi.

Lemma 2.5 Take an element h ∈ G and put τ ′ = Int(h) ◦ τ , t′ = hτ (h)t. Then we
have τ ′2 = Int(t′). For an irreducible smooth representation π of G, π is conjugate
self-dual with respect to τ if and only if it is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ ′.
If π is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ and τ ′, its parity with respect to (τ, t)
coincides with that with respect to (τ ′, t′).

Proof. The claim τ ′2 = Int(t′) is immediate. We write V for the representation
space of π. Assume that π is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ , and take a
non-degenerate pairing h , i : V × V → C satisfying hπ(τ (g))x, π(g)yi = hx, yi.

5

Yoichi Mieda

Let h , ih : V × V → C be the pairing deﬁned by hx, yih = hπ(h)−1x, yi. It is a
non-degenerate pairing and satisﬁes

hπ(τ ′(g))x, π(g)yih = hπ(h)−1π(hτ (g)h−1)x, π(g)yi = hπ(τ (g))π(h)−1x, π(g)yi

= hπ(h)−1x, yi = hx, yih.

Therefore πτ ′ ∼= π∨, that is, π is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ ′. Since
τ = Int(h−1) ◦ τ ′, the converse is also the case.

Let us denote by C (resp. C ′) the parity of π, which is assumed to be conjugate
self-dual, with respect to (τ, t) (resp. (τ ′, t′)). We use the pairing h , ih to compute
C ′. For x, y ∈ V , we have

C ′hx, yih = hπ(t′)y, xih = hπ(h−1t′)y, xi = hπ(τ (h)t)y, xi = hπ(t)y, π(h)−1xi

= Chπ(h)−1x, yi = Chx, yih.

Hence we conclude that C = C ′.

Let H be an open subgroup of G such that H\G is compact. Take a smooth
H χ is irreducible. We will consider when

character χ : H → C× such that π = c-IndG
π is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ , and how to compute the parity of π.

Proposition 2.6 Put H τ = τ −1(H), and write χτ for the character H τ → C×;
h 7→ χ(τ (h)). Assume that there exists a ∈ G which intertwines (H, χ−1) and
(H τ , χτ ); namely, satisﬁes the following conditions:

aHa−1 = H τ , χ(h)−1 = χτ (aha−1) for every h ∈ H.

Then, the representation π = c-IndG
H χ is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ .
Furthermore, an element z = τ (a)ta lies in H, and the parity Cπ of π is given by
χ(z).

H χ)τ

Proof. For f ∈ c-IndG
it is easy to see that f τ belongs to c-IndG
phism (c-IndG
f ∈ c-IndG

Since H is cocompact in G, we have (c-IndG
H χ)τ ∼= c-IndG
we have πτ = (c-IndG
conjugate self-dual with respect to τ .

H χ, let f τ : G → C be the function g 7→ f (τ (g)). Then,
H τ χτ , and f 7→ f τ gives an isomor-
H τ χτ of G-representations. On the other hand, for
H τ χτ , let f a : G → C be the function g 7→ f (ag). We can check that f a
∼=−→ c-IndG
H χ−1.
H χ−1. Hence
H χ−1 ∼= π∨. In other words, π is

H τ χτ ∼= c-IndG

H χ−1 and f 7→ f a gives an isomorphism c-IndG

H τ χτ

H χ)∨ ∼= IndG

H χ−1 = c-IndG

Next we prove z ∈ H. First we will see that z normalizes (H, χ). Since H τ =
aHa−1, we have H = τ (a)τ 2(H τ )τ (a)−1 = τ (a)tH τ t−1τ (a)−1 = zHz−1. Therefore z
normalizes H. Moreover, for h ∈ H we have

χ(z−1hz) = χτ (az−1hza−1)−1 = χτ (t−1τ (a)−1hτ (a)t)−1 = χ(a−1t−1τ (h)ta)−1

= χτ (t−1τ (h)t) = χ(h).

6

Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate self-dual representations

Thus z ﬁxes χ.

Recall that we are assuming that π = c-IndG

H χ is irreducible. Therefore,

HomG(π, π) = HomH(χ, (c-IndG

H χ)|H) ∼= HomH(cid:16)χ, Mg∈H\G/H

c-IndH

H∩g−1Hg χg(cid:17)

is one-dimensional (here χg denotes the character h′ 7→ χ(gh′g−1) on H ∩ g−1Hg).
Since c-IndH
H∩z−1Hz χz = χ, z must lie in H; otherwise the direct sum above contains
χ ⊕ χ.

Finally we compute the parity of π. Deﬁne a pairing h , i : c-IndG

H χ×c-IndG

H χ →

C by

hf1, f2i = Xg∈H\G

By deﬁnition we can compute as follows:

f2(g′)f1(a−1t−1τ (g′)) = Xg′∈H\G

χ(z)−1f1(τ (ag′))f2(g′) = χ(z)−1hf1, f2i.

At the equality (∗), we put g′ = τ (agt). As τ (aHgt) = τ (aHa−1)τ (agt) = Hτ (agt),
this replacement is well-deﬁned. Hence the parity Cπ = C −1
π of π equals χ(z). This
completes the proof.

Proposition 2.6 will be used in Section 4.

2.2 Division algebra setting

Let F + be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld and F a separable extension of F + such
that [F : F +] ≤ 2. Denote by τ the generator of Gal(F/F +). Let q (resp. q′) denote
the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of OF (resp. OF +). We denote the characteristic
of Fq by p.

The extension F/F + provides two well-known examples of (G, τ, t) in the previ-

ous subsection.

Example 2.7 For an integer n ≥ 1, put G = GLn(F ). Let τ : G → G be an
automorphism induced by τ ∈ Gal(F/F +). Then we have τ 2 = id, and we can set
t = 1.

7

Yoichi Mieda

Example 2.8 Let G be the Weil group WF of F . Fix an element c ∈ WF + whose
image in WF +/WF is a generator, and let τ : G → G be Int(c). Then c2 lies in WF ,
and we can set t = c2. The conjugate self-duality and the parity are independent
of the choice of c. Indeed, another choice of c is of the form wc with w ∈ WF . Use
Lemma 2.5 to τ ′ = Int(wc) = Int(w) ◦ τ and t′ = (wc)2 = w(cwc−1)c2 = wτ (w)t.

The conjugate self-duality and the parity in this case coincides with those in

[GGP12, §3] and [Mok15, §2.2].

The parity under the setting in Example 2.8 is interesting because of the following

theorem:

Theorem 2.9 Let π be an irreducible supercuspidal representation of GLn(F ) and
recF (π) the corresponding n-dimensional irreducible smooth representation of WF
under the local Langlands correspondence.
(i) The representation π is conjugate self-dual under the setting in Example 2.7 if

and only if recF (π) is conjugate self-dual under the setting in Example 2.8.

(ii) Assume that F 6= F + and the characteristic of F is 0. The representation π
belongs to the image of the standard (resp. twisted) base change lift from the
quasi-split unitary group UF/F +(n) if and only if the parity CrecF (π) is equal to
(−1)n−1 (resp. (−1)n). For the notion of the base change lift, see [Mok15, §2].

In the following, we introduce another setting. Fix a separable closure F and a
uniformizer ̟ of F . For an integer n ≥ 1, we denote by Fn (resp. F +
n ) the unramiﬁed
extension of degree n of F (resp. F +) contained in F , and by σ ∈ Gal(Fn/F ) the
arithmetic Frobenius lift. Let D be the central division algebra over F with invariant
1/n. Recall that D can be written as Fn[Π], where Π is an element satisfying
Πn = ̟ and Πa = σ(a)Π for every a ∈ Fn. Assuming the tameness of F/F +, we
will explicitly construct an isomorphism τ : D → D whose restriction to the center
F coincides with τ ∈ Gal(F/F +).

Deﬁnition 2.10 Assume that F/F + is at worst tamely ramiﬁed.
(i) Suppose that F/F + is an unramiﬁed quadratic extension. Then, τ ∈ Gal(F/F +)
is canonically extended to the arithmetic Frobenius lift in Gal(Fn/F +), that is
also denoted by τ . It satisﬁes σ = τ 2. In this case, we take ̟ in F + and deﬁne
τ : D → D by a 7→ τ (a) (a ∈ Fn) and Π 7→ Π. We put t = Π.

(ii) Suppose that F/F + is a ramiﬁed quadratic extension (thus p 6= 2). Then, the
n ) → Gal(F/F +) is an isomorphism. We also write

restriction map Gal(Fn/F +
τ for the generator of Gal(Fn/F +
In this case, we can (and do) take ̟ so that τ (̟) = −̟. Fix an element β ∈ F
such that βqn−1 = −1 and put α = βq−1. Since αqn−1 = (−1)q−1 = 1, α belongs
n ) and NrFn/F (α) = α1+q+···+qn−1 = βqn−1 = −1. We
to µqn−1(F ) = µqn−1(F +
deﬁne τ : D → D by a 7→ τ (a) (a ∈ Fn) and Π 7→ αΠ. Note that (αΠ)n =
NrFn/F (α)Πn = −̟ = τ (̟) and (αΠ)τ (a) = ασ(τ (a))Π = τ (σ(a))(αΠ), which
ensure the well-deﬁnedness of τ . We put t = β−2 ∈ µqn−1(F ) = µqn−1(F +

n ). It commutes with σ ∈ Gal(Fn/F ).

n ).

Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate self-dual representations

(iii) If F = F +, then we deﬁne τ : D → D to be the identity map. We put t = 1.

In each case we can check that τ 2(d) = tdt−1 holds for every d ∈ D. Therefore,

the triple (D×, τ, t) gives an example of the setting in Section 2.1.

Remark 2.11 (i) In the second case, the conjugate self-duality and the parity are
independent of the choice of β. Indeed, let β′ ∈ F be another element such that
β′qn−1 = −1. Then γ = β/β′ lies in µqn−1(F ) = µqn−1(F +
n ). We put α′ = β′q−1
and write τ ′, t′ for τ , t attached to β′, respectively. Since α′Π = γ(αΠ)γ−1, we
have τ ′ = Int(γ) ◦ τ and t′ = β′−2 = γ2t = γτ (γ)t. Hence the independence
follows from Lemma 2.5.

(ii) In the second case, assume that n is odd. Take ε ∈ F×

that η2 = ε−1. We have ηq−1 = −1.
Then, the unique lifting β ∈ µq2−1(OF2) of η satisﬁes βqn−1 = (−1)1+q+···+qn−1 =
−1. Under this choice of β, we have α = βq−1 = −1. Moreover, the element
t = β−2 is the unique element of µq−1(OF ) lifting ε.

q \ (F×

Our main theorem is as follows:

Theorem 2.12 Assume that F/F + is at worst tamely ramiﬁed. Let π be an irre-
ducible supercuspidal representation of GLn(F ) which is conjugate self-dual under
the setting in Example 2.7. We write JL(π) for the irreducible smooth representation
of D× attached to π under the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence.

Then, JL(π) is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ : D× → D× introduced in

Deﬁnition 2.10. Moreover, we have

CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1CJL(π).

Remark 2.13 (i) The case where F = F + and the characteristic of F is 0 has
been obtained in [PR12], in which a discrete series representation π is also
treated. The same statement for the case F = F + is also announced in [Far06,
§5] without proof.

(ii) It is natural to expect that Theorem 2.12 remains true for conjugate self-dual
discrete series representations of GLn(F ). For example, let us consider a twist of
the Steinberg representation π = St ⊗(χ◦ det), where χ : F × → C× is a smooth
character. Since Stτ ∼= St ∼= St∨, the representation π is conjugate self-dual if

Symn−1Std : WF × SL2(C) → GLn(C), where ArtF : F ×
F denotes the
isomorphism of the local class ﬁeld theory, and Std the standard representation

the parity of χ ◦ Art−1

F +(c)) (recall that
F
the image of c under the transfer map W ab

CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1χ(Art−1

where Nrd denotes the reduced norm of D. Its parity Cχ◦Nrd equals χ(Nrd(t)).
By deﬁnition, both Art−1
F +(c) and Nrd(t) lie in (F +)× \ NrF/F +(F ×). Since
χ|(F +)× factors through (F +)×/ NrF/F +(F ×), we conclude that χ(Art−1

3.1 Review of the non-abelian Lubin-Tate theory

To prove Theorem 2.12, we use the non-abelian Lubin-Tate theory, which is a ge-
ometric realization of the local Langlands correspondence for GLn. Here we recall
it brieﬂy. Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld and ̟ its uniformizer. Take an
integer n ≥ 1. We write F ur for the maximal unramiﬁed extension of F inside the
ﬁxed separable closure F , and ˘F for the completion of F ur.

Let Nilp be the category of schemes over O ˘F on which ̟ is locally nilpotent.
For an object S of Nilp, we denote the structure morphism S → Spec O ˘F by φS.
Put S = S ⊗O ˘F
O ˘F /p ˘F . Recall that a formal OF -module over S is a formal group
X over S endowed with an OF -action ι : OF → End(X) such that the following two
actions of OF on the Lie algebra Lie(X) coincide:

– the action induced by ι, and
– that induced by the OS-module structure of Lie(X) and the structure homo-

morphism OF → O ˘F → OS.
Fix a one-dimensional formal OF -module X of OF -height n over Fq = O ˘F /p ˘F .
Such X is unique up to isomorphism. Put D = EndOF (X) ⊗Z Q, which is known to
be a central division algebra over F with invariant 1/n.

Let M : Nilp → Set be the functor that sends S to the set of isomorphism classes
of pairs (X, ρ), where X is a formal OF -module over S and ρ : φ∗
X → X ×S S is
S
an OF -quasi-isogeny. It is known that M is represented by a formal scheme over
O ˘F , which is non-canonically isomorphic to the disjoint union of countable copies
of Spf O ˘F [[T1, . . . , Tn−1]] (see [LT66], [Dri74], [RZ96]). The group of self-isogenies
QIsogOF (X) = D× naturally acts on M on the right; h ∈ D× sends (X, ρ) to
(X, ρ ◦ φ∗
Sh). The formal scheme M is endowed with another structure, called a
Weil descent datum. It is an isomorphism α : M → M that makes the following
diagram commute:

M α

M

Spf O ˘F

σ∗

/ Spf O ˘F .

Here σ : O ˘F → O ˘F is induced from the unique element σ ∈ Gal(F ur/F ) lifting the
arithmetic Frobenius automorphism σ : Fq → Fq, as in Section 2.2.
In order to
describe this isomorphism, it suﬃces to construct a bijection α : M(S) → M(Sσ)
σ∗
for each S ∈ Nilp compatibly, where Sσ denotes the object S
−→
S Frob−1
Spec O ˘F of Nilp. For (X, ρ) ∈ M(S), we deﬁne α(X, ρ) = (X, ρ ◦ φ∗
X ),
where FrobX : X → (σ∗)∗X denotes the qth power Frobenius morphism, which is an
OF -isogeny of OF -height 1.

φS−→ Spec O ˘F

Next we consider level structures. For m ≥ 0, let Mm : Nilp → Set be the
functor that sends S to the set of isomorphism classes of triples (X, ρ, η), where
(X, ρ) ∈ M(S) and η is a Drinfeld m-level structure on X (for its deﬁnition, see

It is represented by a formal scheme ﬁnite and
[Dri74, §4] and [HT01, §II.2]).
ﬂat over M, and {Mm}m≥0 form a projective system called the Lubin-Tate tower.
The action of D× and the Weil descent datum on M naturally extend to Mm,
and they are compatible with the transition morphisms of the tower. Further, the
group GLn(F ) acts on {Mm}m≥0 on the right as a pro-object (see [Str08, §2.2] for
the deﬁnition). This action is called the Hecke action. The principal congruence
subgroup Km = Ker(GLn(OF ) → GLn(OF /pm
F )) of GLn(F ) acts trivially on Mm.
By taking the rigid generic ﬁber, we obtain a projective system {Mm}m≥0 of rigid
spaces, whose transition maps are ﬁnite and ´etale. Each Mm is an n − 1-dimensional
smooth rigid space over ˘F . For a compact open subgroup K of GLn(OF ), we can
deﬁne the rigid space MK as the quotient of Mm by K/Km, where m ≥ 0 is an
integer satisfying Km ⊂ K. It is independent of the choice of m, and MKm coincides
with Mm. These rigid spaces form a projective system {MK}K⊂GLn(OF ) with ﬁnite
´etale transition maps. The actions of D× and GLn(F ), and the Weil descent datum
naturally extend to it.

For a discrete cocompact subgroup Γ of F × (e.g., ̟dZ for an integer d ≥ 1), we
may consider the quotient towers {Mm/Γ}m and {MK/Γ}K, where Γ is regarded
as a discrete subgroup of D× by F × ⊂ D×. It is known that the actions of GLn(F )
on these towers are trivial on Γ ⊂ F × ⊂ GLn(F ) (see [RZ96, Lemma 5.36]).

Now we take a prime number ℓ 6= p and consider the ℓ-adic ´etale cohomology of

the Lubin-Tate tower

3.2 Twisting operator

Here we use the notation introduced in the beginning of Section 2.2. We will con-
struct the twisting operator θ : Mm → Mm.

First we consider the case where F/F + is an unramiﬁed quadratic extension. In
this case we have F ur = (F +)ur. We write τ for the unique element of Gal(F ur/F +)
lifting the q′th power Frobenius automorphism τ on Fq = Fq′.
It extends τ ∈
Gal(F/F +), and satisﬁes τ 2 = σ. For an object S of Nilp, we write Sτ for the
object S → Spec O ˘F

τ ∗
−→ Spec O ˘F of Nilp.

We write τ ∗X for the pull-back of the formal OF -module X by τ ∗ : Spec Fq →
Spec Fq. On the other hand, we denote by Xτ the formal group X endowed with the
τ−→ OF → End(X)). It is easy to see that τ ∗X
OF -action twisted by τ (that is, OF
and Xτ are one-dimensional formal OF -modules of OF -height n over (Spec Fq)τ ∈
Nilp. Hence these are isomorphic as formal OF -modules. We ﬁx an isomorphism
ι : τ ∗X

∼=−→ Xτ between them. This isomorphism induces an automorphism on D:

Deﬁnition 3.5 (i) An element h ∈ D = EndOF (X) ⊗Z Q determines an element
τ (h) = ι ◦ τ ∗h ◦ ι−1 ∈ EndOF (Xτ ) ⊗Z Q = EndOF (X) ⊗Z Q = D. This gives an
isomorphism τ : D → D such that τ |F = τ ∈ Gal(F/F +).

(ii) We denote the composite of OF -isogenies

Lemma 3.6 The element t ∈ D× satisﬁes τ 2 = Int(t) and τ (t) = t.

Proof. For h ∈ D, we have

τ 2(h) = ι ◦ τ ∗(ι ◦ τ ∗h ◦ ι−1) ◦ ι−1 = (ι ◦ τ ∗ι) ◦ σ∗h ◦ (ι ◦ τ ∗ι)−1

= (t ◦ Frob−1
= t ◦ (Frob−1

X ) ◦ σ∗h ◦ (t ◦ Frob−1
X ◦σ∗h ◦ FrobX) ◦ t−1.

By the functoriality of the relative Frobenius morphisms, the following diagram is
commutative:

FrobX

FrobX

X

h

X

σ∗X

σ∗h

/ σ∗X.

Hence we have τ 2(h) = t ◦ h ◦ t−1, as desired.

Next consider τ (t). We have

τ (t) = ι ◦ τ ∗(ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ FrobX) ◦ ι−1 = ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ σ∗ι ◦ τ ∗ FrobX ◦ι−1

= ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ σ∗ι ◦ Frobτ ∗X ◦ι−1 (∗)

= ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ FrobX = t.

The equality (∗) follows from the functoriality of the relative Frobenius morphisms
with respect to ι : τ ∗X → X. This completes the proof.

Now we construct an isomorphism θ : Mm → Mm that makes the following

diagram commute:

Mm

Deﬁnition 3.7 Let S be an object of Nilp. For (X, ρ, η) ∈ Mm(S), we put
θ(X, ρ, η) = (X τ , ρ ◦ φ∗

Sι, ητ ) ∈ Mm(Sτ ), where

– X τ is the formal group X over S endowed with the OF -action twisted by τ ,

– ρ ◦ φ∗

This gives a bijection θ : Mm(S)
which covers τ ∗ : Spf O ˘F → Spf O ˘F .

∼=−→ Mm(Sτ ), and an isomorphism θ : Mm

∼=−→ Mm

The isomorphism θ is compatible with the transition maps of the tower {Mm}.

Hence it induces automorphisms of the towers {Mm} and {Mm}.

Lemma 3.8 (i) For g ∈ GLn(F ), we have g ◦ θ = θ ◦ τ (g), where τ : GLn(F ) →

GLn(F ) is the isomorphism in Example 2.7.

(ii) For h ∈ D×, we have h ◦ θ = θ ◦ τ (h), where τ : D× → D× is the isomorphism

in Deﬁnition 3.5 (i).

(iii) We have θ2 = α ◦ t and α ◦ θ = θ ◦ α.

Proof. The claim (i) is clear from the deﬁnition of θ.
As for (ii), take (X, ρ, η) ∈ Mm(S). Then we have

(h ◦ θ)(X, ρ, η) = (X τ , ρ ◦ φ∗

Since φ∗

Thus h ◦ θ = θ ◦ τ (h), as desired.

Sι ◦ φ∗

Since φ∗

θ2(X, ρ, η) = α(t(X, ρ, η)). Hence θ2 = α ◦ t. Finally, by (ii) and Lemma 3.6 we
conclude that

S(ι ◦ τ ∗ι) = φ∗

it suﬃces to show θ2
c = αc2 ◦ t and αw ◦ θc = θc ◦ αcwc−1. These are consequences of
Lemma 3.8 (iii), the deﬁnitions of αw and θc, and the equality ν(cwc−1) = ν(w).

Next we consider the case where F/F + is a ramiﬁed quadratic extension (here
we do not need the tameness assumption). We also write τ for the unique non-trivial

Note that τ 2 = 1 and τ = 1, where τ denotes the automorphism of the residue ﬁeld

(ii) For h ∈ D×, we have h ◦ θ = θ ◦ τ (h), where τ : D× → D× is the isomorphism

(iii) We have θ2 = t and α ◦ θ = θ ◦ α.

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 3.8, it suﬃces to show θ2 = t. For an object S of

Theorem 3.16 Here we consider (τ, t) as in Deﬁnitions 3.5, 3.10, 3.14. Let π be
an irreducible supercuspidal representation of GLn(F ) which is conjugate self-dual
under the setting in Example 2.7. Then, JL(π) is conjugate self-dual with respect
to τ . Moreover, we have

CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1CJL(π),

where CJL(π) denotes the parity of JL(π) with respect to (τ, t).

Proof. Since π is conjugate self-dual, its central character ωπ satisﬁes ωπ(τ (z)) =
ωπ(z)−1 for every z ∈ F × ⊂ GLn(F ). Hence, for a uniformizer ̟′ of F +, we have
ωπ(̟′2) = 1. Put Γ = ̟′2Z ⊂ (F +)× ⊂ F ×. It is a τ -stable discrete cocompact
subgroup of F × on which ωπ is trivial.

Thus JL(π) is conjugate self-dual with respect to τ . Finally, by the existence of the
pairing h , i, we conclude that the parity of the irreducible representation JL(π)∨ ⊠
recF (π)∨ of D× × WF with respect to (τ × τ, (t, c2)) is equal to (−1)n−1. Replacing

have CJL(π)CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1, and CrecF (π) = (−1)n−1CJL(π). This completes the
proof.

3.3 Formal OF -module over Fq and division algebra

Our remaining task for proving Theorem 2.12 is to describe (τ, t) in Deﬁnitions 3.5
and 3.10 explicitly, under the assumption that F/F + is at worst tamely ramiﬁed
and quadratic.

First we consider the easier case where F has equal characteristic. In this case,
we have F = Fq((̟)). We can take a one-dimensional formal OF -module X over Fq
as follows:

[a]X(X) = aX (a ∈ Fq),

[̟]X(X) = X qn

.

Any element a ∈ Fqn gives an endomorphism X 7→ aX of X. On the other hand, we
write Π for the endomorphism X 7→ X q of X. Note that Πa = aqΠ for a ∈ Fqn and
Πn = ̟ in EndOF (X). These elements are known to generate EndOF (X), and we
have EndOF (X) = Fqn[Π] = OFn[Π], which is a maximal order of the central division
algebra over F with invariant 1/n.

Assume that F/F + is an unramiﬁed quadratic extension. We may assume that

F + = Fq′((̟)). Then, τ ∗X and Xτ are described explicitly as follows:

[a]τ ∗X(X) = τ (aX) = aq′
[a]Xτ (X) = [τ (a)]X(X) = aq′

X (a ∈ Fq),

X (a ∈ Fq),

[̟]τ ∗X(X) = τ (X qn
[̟]Xτ (X) = X qn
.

) = X qn

,

Hence we may take ι = idX : τ ∗X

∼=−→ Xτ . The following lemma is immediate.

Proposition 3.17 The pair (τ, t) constructed from ι = idX as in Deﬁnition 3.5
coincides with that in Deﬁnition 2.10 (i).

Next assume that p 6= 2 and F/F + is a ramiﬁed quadratic extension. We may

assume that F + = Fq((̟2)). Then Xτ is described as follows:

[a]Xτ (X) = aX (a ∈ Fq),

[̟]Xτ (X) = [−̟]X(X) = −X qn

.

Take β ∈ Fq such that βqn−1 = −1, and put α = βq−1. Then, we may take an
isomorphism ι : X

∼=−→ Xτ ; X 7→ β−1X.

Proposition 3.18 The pair (τ, t) constructed from ι : X 7→ β−1X as in Deﬁnition
3.10 coincides with that in Deﬁnition 2.10 (ii).

Proof. For a ∈ Fqn ⊂ OFn[Π], we have τ (a) : X 7→ β−1aβX = aX; that is, τ (a) = a.
On the other hand, we have τ (Π) : X 7→ β−1(βX)q = αX q, and thus τ (Π) = αΠ.
Clearly we have t = β−2. Hence the pair (τ, t) coincides with that in Deﬁnition 2.10
(ii).

Now we consider the case where F is a p-adic ﬁeld. We regard formal OF -modules
over Fq as ̟-divisible OF -modules. We use the Dieudonn´e theory for ̟-divisible
OF -modules over Fq developed in [FGL08, Chapitre I, §B.8]. Here we identify O ˘F

i 6= 1,

where (e1, . . . , en) denotes the standard basis of D. Then, by [FGL08, Chapitre I,
Proposition B.8.2], we can ﬁnd a ̟-divisible OF -module X of OF -height n over Fq
satisfying DOF (X) ∼= (D, F, V ). Since V is topologically nilpotent and dimFq
D/V D =
1, X is a one-dimensional formal OF -module.

Let D = Fn[Π] be the central division algebra over F with invariant 1/n as in
Section 2.2, and OD = OFn[Π] its maximal order. We will construct a homomor-
phism OD → EndOF (X). First, any a ∈ OFn deﬁnes an O ˘F -linear endomorphism
7→ σi(a)ei. Since it commutes with F and V , it gives an element of
on D by ei
EndOF (X). Let Π be the O ˘F -linear endomorphism on D such that

Π(ei) =(ei−1

̟en

i 6= 1,
i = 1.

It also commutes with F and V , and gives an element of EndOF (X). It is imme-
diate to observe that Πa = σ(a)Π for a ∈ OFn and Πn = ̟ as endomorphisms
of D. Therefore we obtain a homomorphism OD = OFn[Π] → EndOF (X), which is
in fact an isomorphism.
In the following, we identify OD and EndOF (X) by this
isomorphism.

We assume that F/F + is an unramiﬁed quadratic extension, and take ̟ in F +.
Recall that in this case τ also denotes the unique element of Gal(F ur/F +) lifting
the q′th power Frobenius automorphism τ on Fq = Fq′. We describe τ ∗X and Xτ by
means of the Dieudonn´e module as follows.

τ−→ Fq. We also write τW for the composite W (Fq) → W (Fq)

Proposition 3.19 Let τW : W (Fq) → W (Fq) denote the homomorphism induced

from Fq
Note that the Dieudonn´e module of a formal OF -module over (Spec Fq)τ ∈ Nilp is a
free OF ⊗W (Fq),τW W (Fq)-module endowed with F and V . We identify OF ⊗W (Fq),τW
W (Fq) with O ˘F by the isomorphism OF ⊗W (Fq),τW W (Fq) τ ⊗id−−→
OF ⊗W (Fq) W (Fq) =
O ˘F .
(i) For a formal OF -module Y over Fq, we have DOF (τ ∗Y) = τ∗DOF (Y) and

∼=

DOF (Yτ ) = DOF (Y), where τ∗ denotes the base change by τ : O ˘F → O ˘F .

(ii) For X introduced above, we have DOF (τ ∗X) ∼= DOF (X).

Proof. We prove (i). By functoriality we have DOF (τ ∗Y) = (id ⊗τW )∗DOF (Y). Un-
der the identiﬁcation OF ⊗W (Fq),τW W (Fq) = O ˘F , this equals

(τ ⊗ id)∗(id ⊗τW )∗DOF (Y) = τ∗DOF (Y).

20

Parity of the Langlands parameters of conjugate self-dual representations

On the other hand, we have DOF (Yτ ) = (τ −1⊗id)∗DOF (Y). Under the identiﬁcation,
this clearly corresponds to the O ˘F -module DOF (Y).

The assertion (ii) is clear from the deﬁnition of X and the identiﬁcation

as τ (̟) = ̟.

Proposition 3.20 Let ι : τ ∗X
phism in Proposition 3.19 (ii) on the Dieudonn´e modules. The pair (τ, t) constructed
from this ι as in Deﬁnition 3.10 coincides with that in Deﬁnition 2.10 (i).

Proof. The claim on τ is clear from the deﬁnition. We will prove ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ FrobX = Π.
Recall that FrobX : X → σ∗X induces V : DOF (X) → σ∗DOF (X) = DOF (σ∗X). On the
D(ι)
other hand, the composite σ∗D = DOF (σ∗X)
−−→ DOF (X) = D
is equal to (x1, . . . , xn) 7→ (σ(x1), . . . , σ(xn)). Since Π(ei) = V (ei) for every i, we
conclude that ι ◦ τ ∗ι ◦ FrobX = Π.

D(τ ∗ι)

Next we assume that p 6= 2 and F/F + is a ramiﬁed quadratic extension, and
take ̟ so that τ (̟) = −̟. Recall that in this case τ also denotes the unique
non-trivial element of Gal(F ur/(F +)ur).

Proposition 3.21 (i) For a formal OF -module Y over Fq, we have DOF (Yτ ) =

(iii) For an element h ∈ EndOF (X), regard D(h) : D → D as a matrix (hij) ∈

by h : Xτ → Xτ is given by the matrix (τ −1(hij)).

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is clear from functoriality. The second is obvious from the
deﬁnition of X and the identiﬁcation

D ∼= τ −1

∗ D; (x1, . . . , xn) 7→ (τ (x1), . . . , τ (xn)),

as τ (̟) = −̟. Let h and (hij) be as in (iii). Under the identiﬁcation D ∼= τ −1
above, τ −1

homomorphism D = DOF (X) → DOF (Xτ ) = D is given by ei 7→ σi(β)−1ei.

Then, the pair (τ, t) constructed from this ι as in Deﬁnition 3.10 coincides with

that in Deﬁnition 2.10 (ii).

D(ι◦a◦ι−1)
Proof. For a ∈ OFn ⊂ OD, the composite D = DOF (Xτ )

maps ei to σi(a)ei. Hence, by Proposition 3.21 (iii), ι ◦ a ◦ ι−1 ∈ EndOF (Xτ )

Since β ∈ µ2(qn−1)(O ˘F ), we have σ(β)/β = βq−1 = α. Hence σi(β)/σi−1(β) equals
σi−1(α). Similarly, we have σ(β)/σn(β) = βq/βqn = βq/(−β) = −βq−1 = −α.
n is ﬁxed by τ , we can conclude that ι ◦ Π ◦ ι−1 ∈

EndOF (Xτ ) corresponds to αΠ ∈ EndOF (X) under the identiﬁcation EndOF (X) =

We can observe that the composite X

ι−→ X equals β−2 in the same way,

by using the fact that β ∈ µ2(qn−1)(O ˘F ) ⊂ O(F +)ur is ﬁxed by τ .

By Theorem 3.16 and Propositions 3.17, 3.18, 3.20, 3.22, we complete the proof

of Theorem 2.12.

tions

4.1 Conjugate self-dual simple supercuspidal representations

Here we apply our main theorem to simple supercuspidal representations. Let the
notation be as in Section 2.2. We brieﬂy recall the notion of simple supercuspidal
representations of GLn(F ) and D×. See [GR10], [RY14], [KL15] and [IT14] for
detail. Throughout this section, we ﬁx a non-trivial additive character ψ : Fq → C×
which factors through TrFq/Fp : Fq → Fp.

First consider the case of GLn(F ). Let us denote by Iw the standard Iwahori
subgroup of GLn(F ), namely, the subgroup of GLn(OF ) consisting of matrices whose
image in GLn(Fq) is upper triangular. We write Iw+ for the pro-p unipotent radical
of Iw; it consists of matrices in Iw whose diagonal entries lie in 1 + pF . Each element
ζ ∈ F×

q gives rise to a character

ψζ : Iw+ → C×;

Λζ,χ,c, which turns out to be an irreducible supercuspidal

malizes O×
F Iw+, we obtain aHζa−1 = H(−1)nζ. Moreover, we can directly check
that Λζ,χ,c(h)−1 = Λ(−1)nζ,χ−1,χ(−1)c−1(aha−1) for h ∈ Hζ. Therefore a intertwines
(Hζ, Λ−1
ζ,χ,c) and (H(−1)nζ, Λ(−1)nζ,χ−1,χ(−1)c−1). By the same way as in the proof of

Corollary 4.6 Let (ζ, χ, c) be as in Proposition 4.5.

equal to χ(ε)c.

(ii) Suppose that p 6= 2, F/F + is a ramiﬁed quadratic extension and τ (̟) = −̟.

Then the parity of recF (πζ,χ,c) is equal to

−1 if χ is non-trivial.

(iii) Suppose that F = F +. Then the parity of recF (πζ,χ,c) is equal to

(−1 if χ is trivial,

if χ is non-trivial.

Proof. Clear from Theorem 2.12, Theorem 4.4 and Proposition 4.5. Recall that in
the case (ii) (resp. (iii)), n is odd (resp. even).

Remark 4.7 By Corollary 4.6 (iii), if a simple supercuspidal representation π of
GL2n(F ) is self-dual and has trivial central character, recF (π) is symplectic and π
comes from SO(2n + 1) by the endoscopic lifting. It is a starting point of a recent
work of Oi [Oi16a].

On the other hand, if F has characteristic 0 and p 6= 2, Corollary 4.6 (i) has

been obtained in [Oi16b] by using the endoscopic character relation.
