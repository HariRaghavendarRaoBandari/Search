The Maximum Energy Dissipation Principle (MEDP) for dynamics fracture, far from equilibrium,
proposed by Slepyan was modiﬁed. This modiﬁcation includes a decoupling between the injected
and dissipated energy by adding of a time delay and a description of the ruggedness produced
by dissipation patterns. A time delayed energy conservation equation is deduced and dynamical
equations that describe the dynamical system evolution were obtained in analogous way to the
Slepyan’s calculations. The conditions for the rising of the instability process were presented by
a bifurcation map. These results shown that the theoretical framework proposed can describe the
instability process along with dissipation patterns formation. This proposal was applied to dynamics
fracture where it was possible to explain the results obtained by Fineberg-Gross for the fast crack
propagation in PMMA. For unstable or dynamical crack propagation it is shown the possibility to
predict crack patterns using this MEDP for other experimental conﬁgurations.

INTRODUCTION

2

Some mechanical systems display instability behavior along with the phenomena of dissipative structures and
patterns formation1–4. It has been found that this occurs as a response to extreme energy input events, and cracks
formation is a good illustration for that purpose4,5. These structures and patterns typically exhibit a branched
geometry that can be characterized as a fractal, between a ﬁnite range of scales min ≤  ≤ max)3,4. However,
there is not yet a complete treatment in Mechanics and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics able to describe all this
phenomenology, from the unstable dynamic until to the growth of a dissipation structure or the fractal pattern
formation5–9. From the basic assumption that there is a delay of rates and speeds between the system input and
output, a principle of maximum energy dissipation was postulated and corresponding dynamic evolution equations
were obtained. The dynamics of the system is described by these equations, from the generated instability to the
formation of structures and fractal patterns. It was observed that the delay of those speeds gives rise to the appearance
of iterated equations which in turn lead to the logistic maps which describe the evolution dynamics of the system.
An application to dynamic fracture was implemented and the obtained analytical results were compared with the
already observed experimental instabilities in the phenomenon of fast cracking. Furthermore it is concluded that
the above proposed delay of velocities in the description of the instability is adequate to describe the process of
energy dissipation, leading naturally to the mathematical description of fractal patterns formation, and explaining
the fracture instability in high speed regime. This makes an essential and unifying step in physics of fracture towards
solving a critical outstanding problem.

It is known the existence of dissipation patterns in Nature and particularly well on fracture of materials1–3. Over
the years of research on Physics of Fracture it was realized that in the processes of unstable crack propagation
where instability and catastrophic situations occur, structures and branched patterns are produced, which can only
be described by a suitable dynamic theory involving the formation of fractals or multifractals. But a fundamental
question is the following: Is it possible to predict the crack patterns on fast crack growth? In a branched crack, the
, with a unitary energy, us given by the spatial density, ρs ≡ dNs/dLs
, arises as a consequence of an eﬃcient energy dissipation process searching alternatives modes of dissipation, where
this number of minimal cracks is optimized by maximizing the dissipation and minimizing the energy transport4.
To answer that former question, one needs to consider the possibility to include together in the same theoretical
framework: (i) the non-linear equations of a dynamical system; (ii) a fundamental thermodynamical dissipation
principle to describe the instability process able to generate equations that supply iterated maps which can ﬁnally
represent a pattern. Thus with this purpose one can use the dynamic fracture and add a modiﬁed version of the
maximum dissipation principle (MEDP) proposed by Slepyan to forecast the experimental results found by Fineberg
and co-workers1,2.

The motivation of this work is based on the present absence of a non-equilibrium description for the complete
phenomenological sequence, from the dynamics of instability to the growth of the dissipation structure or forma-
tion of fractal patterns.
In order to contribute for ﬁlling such gap, and leading to a clariﬁcation of the involved
thermodynamics, equations on maximum dissipation energy in fracture dynamics are developed.

A. The proposal of a modiﬁed Maximum Energy Dissipation Principle

One assumes that the existence of a dissipation process with a branched pattern must be due to some non-equilibrium
thermodynamic principle valid when instability conditions and the formed structure can be related. The ﬁrst condition
necessary is the presence of an excess of energy injected with regard to additional internal energy that the system can
support. Another condition is the extremization of the energy distributed by the structure of the dissipation pattern.
A modiﬁed version of the Slepyany’s maximum dissipation principle5,6 can be proposed from the balance of excess
energy, ϕ between the supplied energy ˙φ = (cid:126)G(Lφ(t), vφ(t)).(cid:126)vφ(t) and the dissipated energy as a crack growth, ψs =

(cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48)).(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)) where (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48)) = us(cid:126)ρs(t(cid:48)) is the resistance to growth the crack pattern, as follow:

(cid:104) (cid:126)G(Lφ(t), (cid:126)vφ(t)).(cid:126)vφ(t) − (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48)).(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

(cid:105)

ds = 0

(1)

where Γ is the curve that involves the structure generated in diﬀerent steps of iteration, resulting possibly in invariant
structure by scale transformation. G(Lφ(t), (cid:126)vφ(t)) is the elastodynamic energy released rate and Lφ(t), (cid:126)vφ(t) are the
length and the velocities of the deformations imposed to the dynamical system, and Lφ(t(cid:48)), (cid:126)vφ(t(cid:48)) are the length and
the velocities to form the dissipation pattern. One can admit that the decoupling between these two velocities as
responsible by instability process, is given by a time delay τ between them. This time delay can be calculated by the
input and the output energy of the system, in terms of ratio between the minimal characteristic crack length, lmin
and the maximal possible crack growth velocity, (cid:126)vφmax as:

τ =

lmin
vφmax

=

G.lmin

G.cR − R.vs

=

lmin

[cR − vs/α]

= characteristic

(2)

where vφmax ≈ (2/3)cR and cR is the limiting velocity given by Rayleigh waves velocities. In addition one can deﬁne
a parameter α = G/R which is taken from Griﬃth-Irwin theory of fracture mechanics. Where G is the elastic energy
released rate and R is the crack growth resistance.

Considering the existence of this time delay corroborated by the experimental correlations measurements between
the oscillations in the crack growth velocity and the surface proﬁle, of approximately 3.0µs and 1.0µs for PMMA and
for the glass soda-lime, respectively1–3, one can obtain from the variational calculation of the Eq. (1), the following
form for energy conservation principle:

˙φ (Lφ(t), (cid:126)vφ(t)) = ψs (Ls(t(cid:48)), (cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)))

(3)

This equation relates the injected power with the dissipated power.
In the experiments performed by Fineberg-Gross1,2 they showed that as the crack speed reaches a critical value
a strong temporal correlation between velocity, vφ(t), and the response in the form of fracture surface at vφ(t(cid:48)) =
dAφ(t + τ )/dt, takes place (having its notation changed, in the present text, to Lφ(t) instead Aφ(t) to designate the
fracture surface length). The time delay measured between these two magnitudes present a value about of 3.0µs for
PMMA and 1.0µs for soda-lime glass, for example, showing that there is a characteristic value for each material. By
other side, Sharon et. al3 states that, after a time of 1.0µs, the stress ﬁeld is recuperated equal to the ﬁeld stress
of a single crack: ”Thus 1.0µs after the death of a side branch of length 1.0mm, the stress ﬁeld throughout the
singular zone will be that a single crack”. Also Washabaugh and Knauss7 aﬃrms that: ”The generation of micro
cracks, and thus, presumably, the retardation of crack propagation may be demonstrated by generating a material
with controllable cohesive strength (a weak plane) while maintaining all other physical properties”.

B. The Instability Dynamics Equations

Therefore one assumes that in fracture dynamics the instability appears as a consequence of a time delay between
the injected energy ﬂux ˙φ(t) and the dissipated energy ﬂux ψs(t + τ ), in the form of fracture surfaces, as the injected
energy ﬂux interacts with the dissipated energy ﬂux ψs(t + τ ) after a time delay, given by the relaxation process in
the material.

The remaining mathematical consideration of the variational principle from the Eq.

(1) supplies the following

diﬀerential equations:

i) for the conditions (cid:126)vs(t) = (cid:126)vφ(t):

(cid:34)

=

∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

.(cid:126)vφ(t) − (cid:126)Rs(t)

∂M (t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:34)

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:35)

−

.(cid:126)vφ(t) + (cid:126)Gφ(t)

(cid:35)

= 0

(4)

Then the velocity of formation of the dissipative pattern is given by:

(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)) = − (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))

∂(cid:126)vs

(cid:16) lmin

(cid:17)1−Dq

This diﬀerential equation shows that the form of the function (cid:126)Rs = usdNs/dLs ≈ usDq
1
lmin is a kind of
homogenous function that satisfy the Euler’s theorem for fractal or multifractal patterns. According to the fractal
theory, if the homogeneity is global, i.e. q = 0 one has a fractal, or if the homogeneity is local, i.e. q (cid:54)= 0, change with
regions, one has a multifractal10.

Upon receipt of this diﬀerential equations system we can get the functional dependencies of the velocities for the

formation of the dissipation structure, developing the diﬀerential Eq. (4)) in the following way:

∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:126)vφ(t) + (cid:126)Gφ(t) =

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:126)vφ(t) +

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))
∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

using the Eq. (7) in Eq. (8) one has

vs(t(cid:48)) =

− (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂ (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))
∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))
∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

(cid:33)

(cid:41)

(cid:126)vφ(t)

(8)

(9)

In analogous way made before in the Eq.
introducing the following term:

(7) one can consider that the (cid:126)Gφ(t) is too homogenous. Therefore,

(10)

(11)

(14)

Then the velocity permitted by the instantaneous deformation (cid:126)vφ is given by:

(cid:126)vφ(t) = −

(cid:104) (cid:126)Gφ(t) − (cid:126)Rs(t)
(cid:105)
(cid:105)
(cid:104) ∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t) − ∂ (cid:126)Rs(t)

∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

= 0

ii) for (cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)) = (cid:126)vφ(t + τ ): Another diﬀerential equations of evolution of the dynamical system from Eq. (1):

where µ(t, t(cid:48)) is a control parameter, one has:

(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)) = µ(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:40)

µ(t, t(cid:48)) =

− (cid:126)Gφ(t)
(cid:126)vφ(t)
∂Rs(t(cid:48))
∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

− (cid:126)Gφ(t)
(cid:126)vφ(t)

∂(us(cid:126)ρs(t(cid:48)))

∂(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))

=

∂ (cid:126)Rs(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

− ∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:35)

(cid:41)

(cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:34)

1 − 1

(cid:126)Gφ(t)

Denoting:

(cid:104) ∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t) − ∂(usρs(t))
(cid:33)
from Eq. (5) for t = t(cid:48) one gets the classical equation for the crack growth velocity:

(cid:104) ∂ (cid:126)Gφ(t)
∂(cid:126)vφ(t) − ∂Rs(t)

(cid:126)vφ max = −

(cid:126)Gφ(t)

(cid:126)Gφ(t)

∂(cid:126)vφ(t)

∂(cid:126)vφ

(cid:105)

(cid:126)vφ(t) = (cid:126)vφ max

(cid:105) = −
(cid:32)
1 − (cid:126)Rs(t)
(cid:126)Gφ(t)
(cid:18)

(cid:19)

and ﬁnally from Eq. (11) the following relation between the velocities is then supplied:

(cid:126)vs(t(cid:48)) = µ(t, t(cid:48))(cid:126)vφ(t)

1 − (cid:126)vφ(t)
(cid:126)vφ max

5

and from Eq. (7) one gets that

(cid:32) (cid:126)Gφ(t)

(cid:19)

(cid:126)vφ(t)

µ(t, t(cid:48)) =

Therefore from Eq. (14) one has the classical equation for the elastodynamic energy released rate, (cid:126)G(Lφ, vφ) given

by:

(cid:126)Gφ(Lφ(t), vφ(t)) =

(cid:16)

(cid:126)Rs(t(cid:48))
1 − (cid:126)vφ(t)

(cid:126)vφ max

(cid:17)

(16)

This equation a direct consequence of MEDP.

C. The Iterated Functions and the Logistic Map

Considering the time delay between the velocities where (cid:126)vs = (cid:126)vφ(t + τ ), from Eq. (14) one obtains the logistic
equation (cid:126)vφ(t + τ ) = µ(cid:126)vφ(t)(1 − (cid:126)vφ(t)/(cid:126)vφ max). In terms of a discretized process that happens in steps of time, τ , for
xk+1 = v0(t + τ )/cR and xk = v0(t)/cR one has:

xk+1 = µ (1 − xk) xk

(17)

This equation shows that the energy dissipation can also be written in the form of a logistic map with the consequence
that critical velocity, instability, bifurcation and crack branching, are not explained by the classical theory of fracture.
The interpretation of this equation for the dynamic crack growth is shown in the Fig. 1.
fraction of the velocity µxk is balanced by the remaining partial fraction of the velocity 1 − xk.

In this ﬁgure, the injected ﬂux Nk = (cid:126)Gk.(cid:126)vk interacts with the dissipated ﬂux Pk = 2γvk+1 in a way that the partial

The energy ﬂux to the crack tip can be represented by Fig. 2a. Observe from this that MEDP (Slepyan Principle)
along with decoupling in time between the velocities provides the mathematical solution for the fracture problem as
logistic iterated system of equations with a time delay. In the Fig. 2a one can also observe the point where the power
and the eﬃciency are optimized when the Eq. (17) is satisﬁed. The plot of iterated functions from Eq. (17) is shown
in the Fig. 2, and for the ﬁrst iteration the solution of the logistic Eq. (17)) is given by the plot in the Fig. 2b.

equation; b) Solutions spectra for logistic map in the intervals of unstable interaction of input and output ﬂuxes in dynamic
fracture problem for (cid:126)vk = 1 − 1/µ

A non-linear instability analysis can be done considering the critical points, where xk+1 = xk = x∗ and x∗ = v/cR.
The ﬁrst critical point, is given by dF (x∗)/dx = 2 − µ < 1 ⇒ µ > 1 if 1 (cid:54) µ (cid:54) 4. Interpreting this in terms of a
dynamic process of crack growth, then,

x∗ = 1 − 1
µ

(18)

if µ < 1 ⇒ x∗ < 0 (reversible process) or if µ = 1 ⇒ x∗ = 0 (stable process) or if µ > 1 ⇒ x∗ > 0 (unstable irreversible process).

For more feed-backed irreversible iterations a doubling period can be obtained from the recursive Eq. (17). Succes-
sive iterations of this function can generate a bifurcation map as shown in the Fig. 3. This map reveals the transition
from stable to unstable process for µ = 3, until the system reach the chaos for a value of 3 < µ < 4.

The plot of the Fig. 3 can represent the diﬀerent aspects, such as, mirror, mist and hackle, associated to the stages
of the fracture surface of brittle materials, found in testing with high velocities or high rates of loading, as PMMA,
glass, etc.

III. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Substituting all the experimental values obtained for Fineberg-Gross in the Eq. (2), for the crack growth velocity
of PMMA, it was found the same time delay of τ = 3.0µs , evidencing that this time is a characteristic for the motion
in this material. The critical velocities at which the instability begins for PMMA and soda-lime glass are 340m/s
and 1100m/s, respectively, and the respective values of superﬁcial Rayleigh waves velocity, cR, in these materials are
975m/s and 3370m/s. For both materials the critical values correspond approximately to vc = 0.34cR. The predicted
chaotic model for the PMMA, provides a critical point at µ = 3, where the critical velocity is vc = cR/3. Comparing
with the experimental results obtained by Fineberg-Gross one has an agreement about 97%.

The maps associated to the dissipation patterns of cracks in fast crack growth phenomena are shown in the Fig. 4a
and Fig. 4b. The equation Eq. (3) relates the injected power N0k = Gφxk with the dissipated power P0k+1 = 2γef xk+1.
It was used to construct the iterated map shown in the Fig. 4. This ﬁgure was constructed in a similar manner of
the illustrative Fig. 2a. From the Eq. (3), the theoretical values of xk+1 = vφ(t + τ )/cR were plotted as a function
of xk = v0(t)/cR, in comparison with the experimental results. Using the same values of t and µ in both cases, one
gets the iterated map shown in the Fig. 4a. This graph shows that theoretical and experimental values are in good
agreement.

The logistic Eq. (17) was used to construct the logistic bifurcation map. From this equation the theoretical values
of vφ(t + τ ) were plotted as function of µ(t), in comparison with the experimental results. Using the same multiples
values of t(cid:48) = t + τ and µ in both cases, the logistic bifurcation map was obtained where this graph is shown in the
Fig. 4b. This graph shows how approximate are the theoretical with experimental values, at each iteration k.

The Eq. (17) was used too to construct the graph shown in the Fig. 5a. From this equation the theoretical values
were plotted as function of time t, in comparison with the experimental results. This was

of relative velocities vφ(t+τ )
done using the same values of µ(t) in both cases.

The Eq. (17) was used too to construct the shown in the Fig. 5b. From this equation those theoretical values of

were plotted as function of relative crack length Lφ/L0c in comparison with the experimental
results. Using the same values of t and µ in both cases. These plots show the ultimate stage of the instability reached in
the Fineberg-Gross experiments. All theses plots show the excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental
results.

IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

One proposal attempts to explain the instability process on fast crack growth were made before8,9 but without
any clear experimental comparison. Now in this paper, a fundamental principle was introduced, which allow us to
obtain the iterated equations and enabling to foresee the dissipation pattern in a complete mathematical scenario,
from non-linear dynamical equations up to the fractal bifurcation map.

The analysis of the bifurcation diagram given by the logistic map equation, shows that the way found by the material
to dissipate the elastodynamic energy excess imposed on it during the fracture process is by generating alternative
ways of energy dissipation through the mechanism of rough instabilities and bifurcations. Therefore, it was shown
from the results obtained with this proposed model that bifurcation process is in agreement with the assertion made
by Gross11:

”The bifurcation is a response to the system being driven further from equilibrium and trying to ﬁnd new ways to
dissipate the forcing. This means that studying the details of the pattern can lead both to an increased understanding
of the bifurcation and to the systems dissipation process”.

Since there are several physical systems where the bifurcation happens, this can reﬂect a general feature of branched
phenomena in nature, where geometric patterns are generated to optimize the energy dissipation. Note that the
formulated MEDP is completely general. However, this result Eq.
(1) and was
deduced as a special case, by taking the fracture of a semi-inﬁnite Griﬃth plate8. Therefore, it depends on the
phenomenology, i.e., in which case the dynamic fracture was applied. Moreover, other iterated functions can be
obtained from MEDP, as the phenomenon is generating other maps diﬀerent from logistic map obtained for the case
of semi-inﬁnite Griﬃth plate.
With the assumption of diﬀerent forms of energy input ˙φ (Lφ(t), (cid:126)vφ(t)) and other hypotheses of the dynamics
mechanism provided by the system for the formation of dissipation branched patterns, given by ψs (Ls(t(cid:48)), (cid:126)vs(t(cid:48))) ,
the Eq. (1) can give rise to diﬀerent bifurcation maps; this will make the whole framework for the proposed principle
much more complex than the one presented in this work. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to highlight an entire
phenomenological framework that is still ”untied” and illustrating it with a known logistic map that can be very well
used in the analysis of dynamic fracture.

(17) follows naturally from Eq.

Daniel M. Dubois in 200612 generated and classiﬁed families of iterated functions that created maps similar to the
logistic map. The study of Dubois can be used to obtain results in balancing the diﬀerent dynamic systems that
exhibit instability and bifurcation.

Still notice that time delay between the input and output ﬂuxes in the system, originated the iterated equations and
that on its turn gave rise to the instability by means of bifurcation maps. Since Feigenbaum constant13 is universal
and common to all of bifurcation maps, one can conclude that a universality of these maps is also associated with the
universality of the principle of maximum energy dissipation. As a general principle in Nature dissipation of energy
should be maximum while the excess, is minimal. Therefore, it is possible that other dissipation energy patterns can

be predicted by this modiﬁed MEDP, using the same mathematical scenario.
