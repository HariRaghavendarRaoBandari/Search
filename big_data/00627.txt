The environment of a quantum dot, which is connected to two leads, is modeled by telegraph
noise, i.e. random Markovian jumps of the (spinless) electron energy on the dot between two levels.
The temporal evolutions of the charge on the dot and of the currents in the leads are studied using a
recently developed single-particle basis approach, which is particularly convenient for the averaging
over the histories of the noise. In the steady state limit we recover the Landauer formula. At a very
fast jump rate between the two levels, the noise does not aﬀect the transport. As the jump rate
decreases, the eﬀective average transmission crosses over from the transmission through a single
(average) level to an incoherent sum of the transmissions through the two levels. The transient
temporal evolution towards the steady state is dominated by the displacement current at short
times, and by the Landauer current at long times. It contains oscillating terms, which decay to zero
faster than for the case without noise. When the average chemical potential on the leads equals the
dot’s “original” energy, without the noise, the oscillations disappear completely and the transient
evolution becomes independent of the noise.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum transport through mesoscopic systems1 is
one of the most extensively investigated areas of the-
oretical physics. This transport is always aﬀected by
coupling to the environment. The exact treatment
of the whole system-environment complex represents a
formidable many-body quantum mechanical problem. It
is therefore useful to study approximate simple models,
which may be justiﬁed in some special limits (see below)
and which may capture the main aspects of the expected
phenomena. One such approximation occurs if the back-
action of the system on the environment can be neglected.
In this case the action of the environment on the system
can be treated as an external ﬂuctuating time-dependent
force. The entire many-body problem is then reduced
to solving the Schr¨odinger equation with time-dependent
potentials, which represent the ﬂuctuating environment.
Since the ﬂuctuations of the environment are random,
the ﬁnal results typically ends up with some averaging
over them.

After a long time, the system usually reached a steady
state. In the presence of the above time-dependent ran-
dom potentials, the steady state properties still require
solving the time-dependent problem.
In addition, the
latter solution also yields the transient evolution of the
system, from a speciﬁc initial conﬁguration towards this
steady state. These transient phenomena contain much
information on the system and on the nature of its cou-
pling to the environment. Experimentally, preparation
of desired charge states in quantum dots can be realized,
and the availability of time-resolved measurement tech-

niques in nanoelectronics makes it feasible to reveal the
special roles played by the transient eﬀects2.

The time-dependent transport problem is not simple.
Considerable eﬀorts have been devoted to the develop-
ment of time-dependent formulations for the transport,
that capture its transient behavior. These include non-
equilibrium Green s function methods (NEGF)3, master
equations techniques4–6, time-dependent density func-
tional theory (TDDFT)7, schemes that combine TDDFT
and NEGF with the hierarchical equation of motion ap-
proach to open quantum dynamics8, hybrid Floquet-
NEGF treatments9 and time-dependent scattering state
methods10,11. All of these schemes are quite heavy,
and it is not easy to adapt them to the case of ran-
domly ﬂuctuating potentials. In the present paper we use
the recently proposed single-electron approach (SEA)12,
based on the single-electron Ansatz for the many-electron
wave-function. This approach solves the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation for a single electron, yields simple
expressions for the transient currents for time-dependent
potentials, and reproduces the Landauer formula13 for
the steady state limit. The SEA is a simple tool, which
can be used to calculate the transient electric currents
and charges in any mesoscopic system of coupled dots.
Reference 12 demonstrated an application of the SEA to
time-dependent transport in oscillating potentials and to
electron pumping.

Since the SEA is valid for arbitrary time-dependent
potentials, it can be used for randomly ﬂuctuating poten-
tials as well. In this paper we combine the SEA approach
with an appropriate averaging to study the eﬀects of a
simple ﬂuctuating environment on the resonant transport
through a single level quantum dot. As we show, this ap-

proach is particularly convenient for such averaging.

The simplest model for the environment is a single de-
gree of freedom, called an “elementary ﬂuctuator”, which
ﬂuctuates between two states. The potential seen by
the system then ﬂuctuates randomly between two values.
Such a random ﬂuctuating potential is called “telegraph
noise”14. Reference 15 listed several examples, in which
back action from the system onto such a ﬂuctuator could
indeed be ignored.
In one example, a single impurity
near the system is either empty or occupied by a sin-
gle electron (double occupancy is prevented by a strong
Coulomb blockade)16. Another example concerned a two-
level system at equilibrium with a heat bath17. For both
the single impurity and the two level system it has been
argued18 that back action can be ignored when the dy-
namics of the ﬂuctuating background charge or the two-
level system is governed by its coupling to a thermalizing
heat bath, which is much stronger than its coupling to
the system. The telegraph noise model is also justiﬁed in
the limit of a very high temperature of this heat bath19.
In a third (non-equilibrium) example, current ﬂows be-
tween two reservoirs through a single electron transistor
(SET) located near the system. The states of the envi-
ronment (SET plus reservoirs) include states in which an
arbitrary number of electrons have moved between the
two reservoirs, while the SET can be (singly) occupied
or empty. When the bias voltage between the reservoirs
is much larger than any other energy in the problem, Ref.
20 found that the Coulomb potential of the SET, as seen
by the system, jumps randomly between its values when
the SET is occupied or empty.

Here we assume that one can ignore back action, and
describe the eﬀects of the environment by the telegraph
noise model. Even if this assumption is only approxi-
mate, we expect the results to be qualitatively correct,
and to stimulate future work which will test them. The
advantage of our approach is obvious: it yields simple an-
alytic expressions, which give insights into the way vari-
ous physical quantities depend on the parameters.

Most of the papers which use telegraph noise in meso-
scopic systems have been motivated by quantum com-
puting, and aimed to reduce the decoherence caused
by the environment in closed systems, e.g. an isolated
qubit15–21. Since environmental noise is very important
in the dynamics of open quantum systems which are cou-
pled to electronic reservoirs, the present paper presents
the eﬀects of telegraph noise on the simplest such system,
i.e. resonant tunnelling through a single level of a quan-
tum well (dot), coupled to two reservoirs, as shown in
Fig. 1. Some of our results in the steady state limit were
already obtained twenty two years ago22, using a com-
pletely diﬀerent approach, but we are not aware of other
treatments of open systems with telegraph noise. Here
we use the SEA approach to obtain many new results,
especially on the transient time evolution of the system
towards the steady state. Unlike many of the treatments
of closed systems, the SEA works with the wave func-
tions, and not with the reduced density matrices. The

2

approach can easily be extended to other open systems.
The system contains spinless electrons, so that the dot
can only contain one electron or be empty. The envi-
ronment is assumed to aﬀect only the energy level of the
electron on the dot, which jumps randomly between the
two values E0 ± U/2,

E0(t) = E0 + ξ(t)U/2 ,

(1)

where ξ(t) = ±1 is a random variable, which follows a
Markov process14,15:
it jumps randomly from 1 to −1
(and vice versa) at the same rate γ/2 (independently of
its previous history). The two values of this energy repre-
sent the two states of the environment. For example, the
energy U can represent the Coulomb energy between the
electron on the dot and the electron on the neighboring
SET.

The SEA approach of Ref. 12 is summarized in Sec.
II. Section III uses this approach to calculate the cur-
rents and the charges on the leads and on the dot, end-
ing up with the example of the time-independent case.
The telegraph noise general theory, and its application
to our model, are described in Sec. IV, while Secs. V
and VI present the results for the steady state and for
the transient currents and charges, respectively. Section
VII presents our conclusions. The Appendix summarizes
the Shapiro-Loginov formula, which is a very useful tool
in deriving averages for the telegraph noise.

(2)

where the operator a†
l(r) creates an electron with energy
El(r) in the left (right) reservoir and a†
0 is the same
inside the quantum dot. The Hamiltonian H is time-
dependent, via an arbitrary time-dependence of the en-
ergy level E0(t). We shall later discuss the special ran-
dom case presented in Eq. (1). The tunneling coupling

energies of the reservoir states with the dot, ΩL,R, are in-
dependent of El,r and of time and can always be taking
real (by an appropriate gauge transformation). Our anal-
ysis of the time-dependent couplings uses the approach
presented in Ref. 12.

At zero temperature, the initial state of the left and
right reservoirs contains NL and NR electrons, respec-
tively, which ﬁll the single electron states with energies
{E¯l ≤ µL, E¯r ≤ µR}, where µL(R) is the Fermi energy
in the left (right) reservoir. Concerning the quantum
dot, we shall consider two initial states, one in which the
dot is occupied (n0 = 1) and one in which it is empty
(n0 = 0). The total number of electrons remains con-
stant in time, N + n0 = NL + NR + n0. We thus start
with the many-body pure state,

|Ψ(0)i = (a†

0)n0Yk

k|0i ,

(3)

where k includes the N = NL + NR states {¯l}, {¯r}. The
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for this wave func-
tion (setting  = 1) is

i∂t|Ψ(t)i = H(t)|Ψ(t)i .

(4)

In order to solve Eq. (4) we use an Ansatz for the total
wave function |Ψ(t)i, by taking it as a (Slater) product
of single-electron wave functions,

|Ψ(t)i =Yk

ˆΦ(k)†(t)|0i ,

(5)

where now we have k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N , and

For convenience, we now order the N states in the
products (3) and (5) by an increasing index, k =
0, 1, 2,
. . . , N . Substituting Eqs. (5) into Eq. (4),
the latter can be rewritten as

Xk Yk′<k

ˆΦ(k′)†(t)(cid:2)i ∂t ˆΦ(k)†(t)(cid:3) Yk′′>k

ˆΦ(k′′)†(t)|0i

ˆΦ(k′′)†(t)|0i .

Using Eq. (6), the commutator reads

It follows from Eqs. (11) that ∂th0| ˆΦ(k)(t) ˆΦ(k)†(t)|0i =

Note that the amplitudes corresponding to diﬀerent ini-

This is a consequence of the quadratic form of the Hamil-
tonian in terms of creation and annihilation operators,
Eq. (2), reﬂecting non-interacting or mean-ﬁeld cases.

III. CHARGES AND CURRENTS

A. Charge on the dot

For the pure state |Ψ(t)i, the average particle numbers
(or charges, in units of the electron charge) inside the
quantum dot and the leads, Q0(t) and QL,R(t), are given
by

Here the sum over l, r extends over all the states (occu-
pied or not) of the leads, whereas the sum over k includes
only the N initially occupied levels. Note that the total
charge is conserved in time, so that QL(t) + QR(t) +
Q0(t) = N + n0. This also follows explicitly from the
normalization condition (12).

The argument µ was added on the left hand side to facili-

we ﬁnd

(45)

The charge on the dot increases from 0 to 1 as the chem-
ical potential increases from −∞ to ∞, see black solid
line in Fig. 2. The main increase occurs in the range
|µ| < Γ/2.

Starting at t = 0 with Q0(µ, 0) = n0, the time-
dependent charge Q0(µ, t) approaches this steady state
with two terms, one oscillating with frequency of order µ
and with a decay rate Γ/2 and the other decaying as e−Γt,
see black solid lines in Fig. 4. For µ 6= 0, the oscillations
in Q0(µ, t) result from electron transitions between the
dot and the leads, and they reﬂect quantum interference
between these transitions. As we discuss below, and as
seen in the ﬁgures, the noise smears these oscillations.
Also, there are no oscillations at µ = 0 (see below).

Substituting Eq. (43) into Eq. (39), the current in the

right lead is

In order to evaluate the last component of the right-
lead current, namely IR→R(t), in the most simple way, we
imply the conservation of probability for a single-electron

IV. TELEGRAPH NOISE

A. Markov process

The noise distribution of the variables {ξ(t)} in Eq. (1)
is characterized by the probabilities pξ0,ξ(t0, t) to ﬁnd ξ(t)
at the value ξ = ±1 on the condition that ξ(t0) = ξ0 [or
pξ0,ξ(t0, t0) = δξ0,ξ]. Therefore,

[2pξ0,1(t0, t) − 1] ,

(49)

where γ/2 is the rate of jumps between two value of ξ(t).
In Eq. (49) we have used pξ0,1(t0, t) + pξ0,−1(t0, t) = 1,
from probability conservation. The solution of this equa-
tion is

pξ0,ξ(t0, t) = (δξ0,ξ − 1/2)e−γ(t−t0) + 1/2 ,

(50)

approaching the steady state value pξ0,ξ(t0, t) → pξ(t) =
1/2 in the steady state limit t − t0 → ∞, independent of
the initial condition (ξ0).

For any given initial value of ξ(t0), the physical quan-
tities (e.g. the charge on the dot) at time t depend on
the speciﬁc history of the changes in ξ(t). We denote the
average over all these histories by angular brackets, h...i.
For example,

hξ(t)i = Xξ=±1

ξpξ0,ξ(t0, t) = (δξ0,1 − δξ0,−1)e−γ(t−t0) .

(51)

In the steady state limit (t0 → −∞) one has hξ(t)i = 0.

6

The noise correlator is generally deﬁned as

hξ(t1)ξ(t1 + τ )i = Xξ1,ξ=±1

ξ1 ξ pξ1(t1) pξ1,ξ(t1, t1 + τ ) ,

(52)

where t1 corresponds to the steady state, pξ1(t1) = ±1/2.
Substituting Eq. (50) into Eq. (52), the correlator be-

comes

hξ(t1)ξ(t1 + τ )i = e−γτ .

It is customary to characterize the noise by its power

We now consider the eﬀects on the telegraph noise
on the measurable quantities, Q0(t) and IR,L(t). To
evaluate hQL,R

From Eq. (39), the currents are also determined by
0(t) [which does not depend on the
(t)i, which depend only
0 (t)i. Thus, it is suﬃcient to calculate the latter
average. To obtain this average, we average Eq. (19) for

renormalization of (E − E0) by a factor [1 − η(E)]. This
appears to be a most noticeable eﬀect of the noise: it can
greatly increase the current for η(E) ∼ 1. The imaginary
part of the shift renormalizes the parameter Γ, yielding
faster relaxation rates and broader conductance peaks
(see below).

In the case of an exponential noise-correlator, Eq. (53),

Comparing Eq. (63) with the t → ∞ limit of Eq. (40),
it looks as if the noise introduces a complex energy-
dependent shift in (E − E0), the diﬀerence between the
electron’s energy and the energy on the dot without the
noise. One might be tempted to introduce this shift
into observable quantities, and proceed as in the case
without noise, Sec.
III C. However, this is not neces-
sarily justiﬁed25: in the present case, the physical mea-
0 (∞)|2i, and not by

surable quantities are given by h|eb(k)
|heb(k)

0 (∞)i|2!
As we show below, the former average is proportional
to Imb(E). The real part of the shift in E leads to a

In this case, B has a single peak around E = 0, which
is slightly broader than that without the noise. The re-
sulting function Q0(µ, ∞) looks similar to the one with-
out the noise, see e.g.
the dashed green line in Fig.
2. Although the noise now generates two levels on the
dot (E = ±U/2), which become randomly occupied, the
width of the noise distribution γ is larger than the dis-
tance between them U , resulting in a single peak. It also
follows from Eq. (68) that in the limit γ → ∞ the eﬀect
of noise disappears.

Second, for γ2 < U 2 one can also write

As U increases above γ, B develops two peaks, at E ≈

±pU 2 − γ2/2, with the same width, (Γ+γ), correspond-

ing to the energy levels E = ±U/2, generated by the
noise, Eq. (1). As µ increases from −∞, the electrons
ﬁrst ﬁll mainly the level E = −U/2 on the dot. Sim-
ilarly, when µ > 0, the electrons ﬁll mainly the level
E = U/2. Q0 reaches maximum slopes near these peaks,
and is almost ﬂat between them. The appearance of this
approximate plateau reﬂects the existence of the two lev-
els.

and therefore also hQ0(0, ∞)i = 1/2.
Indeed, all the
graphs in Fig. 2 obey this symmetry. Interestingly, in-
creasing |U | at ﬁxed µ causes an increase of the the charge
on the dot for µ < 0, when the level −U/2 in ﬁlled, and
decreases this charge for µ > 0, when the level U/2 is
ﬁlled (instead of the “original” level at E0 = 0).

Consider now the steady state current in the right lead.
Substituting Eq. (66) into Eq. (39), we ﬁnd that it again
reproduces Eq. (47), where now the LHS is hIR(∞)i and
B is deﬁned in Eq. (65). The conductance is again de-
scribed by the Landauer formula, and the average trans-
mission is given by Eq. (48). As mentioned above, B(E)
– and therefore also T (µ) – are even functions of µ. As
seen in Fig. 3, this function exhibits a single peak at
µ = 0 for U 2 < γ2, and a double peak for U 2 > γ2.
These results for the steady state current coincide with
those obtained earlier by using very diﬀerent approach22.

FIG. 3: (Color online) Average linear response steady-state
transmission T (µ), for the symmetric case ΓL = ΓR = Γ/2,
when the energy level is ﬂuctuating by the telegraph noise

(solid black), U = 1.8 (dashed green), U = 8 (dotted blue)
and U = 16 (dot-dashed red). All energies are in units of Γ.

When γ2 ≫ U 2 the peak in T (µ) remains at the av-
erage energy E0, with a smaller height and a slightly
larger width. the dot energy “jumps” between the two
levels very quickly, so that one only observes the average
energy. In contrast, when U, Γ ≫ γ, Eq. (71) becomes

(dotted blue) and U = 16 (dot-dashed red). All energies are
in units of Γ.

the transmission is an uncorrelated average of two trans-
missions, corresponding to the two levels. This can be
easily understood qualitatively: a small hopping rate γ
means that the dot remains at each of the levels for a
relatively long time, which yields the resonant scattering
from that level only. It is interesting to compare this re-
sult with the coherent scattering through a dot with two
levels, E± = ±U/2, which are connected to each lead27.
For a coherent scattering through such a dot, the trans-
mission also exhibits two peaks, at E = ±U/2. However,
unlike Eq. (74), which always gives a ﬁnite transmission
at E = 0, this coherent transmission vanishes at E = 0,
reﬂecting the Fano eﬀect which results from quantum in-
terference. In some sense, the telegraph noise eliminates

all these interference eﬀects. Interestingly, when unitar-
ity is broken by allowing leakage of the electrons out of
the system27, then the transmission through the dot be-
comes similar to our results for |U | >> |γ|. In both cases,
the perturbation causes decoherence.

×h sinhh 1
− coshh 1

(75)

where

D(E) = [E + i(Γ + γ)/2]2 + (γ2 − U 2)/4 .

(76)

One can split Eq. (75) into two terms,

b(E, t) = b(E) + δb(E, t) ,

(77)

where b(E) is the steady state value given by Eq. (63),
while δb(E, t) contains two oscillating decaying terms,
which for U = 0 generate the single oscillating term in
Eq. (40), reﬂecting quantum interference due to electron
transitions between the dot and the leads. For γ2 > U 2,
the latter terms have two relaxation rates, Γ±/2 [Eq.
(69)] and one oscillation frequency, E, which is the dif-
ference between the electron’s energy in the lead and the
average energy (E0) on the dot. For U 2 > γ2, these terms
have a single relaxation rate, (Γ + γ)/2, and two oscil-

lation frequencies, E ±pγ2 − U 2/2. In both cases, the

new relaxation rates are larger than Γ/2, which is the re-
laxation rate, generated by coupling with the reservoirs,
in the absence of the noise [Eq. (40)]. The noise increases
the rate of approach to the steady state.

At long times, the rate of approaching the steady
state is dominated by the slowest decaying term, with
the smallest relaxation rate. This rate depends on U .
For |U | < |γ|, this rate is given by Γ−/2. Writing
Γ− = Γ + γd, the second term can be attributed to deco-
herence generated by the telegraph noise. For |U | ≪ |γ|
one has

γd = γ −pγ2 − U 2 ≃

2(cid:19)2

S0(0) ,

(78)

where S0(0) is the noise power spectrum at zero fre-

ence rate and the zero-frequency noise spectrum coincides

9

with the well-known expression for the inverse “dephas-
ing” time, obtained in many models in a weak damping
limit15,20,28,29.

Consider now the temporal behavior of the charge
on the dot and the currents in the leads. Substitution
Eq. (75) into Eqs. (56) reproduces Eq. (43) for hQL,R

with

previous section, and where δB(E, t) contains two oscil-
lating decaying terms.

becomes

Examples of the time evolution of hQ0(µ, t)i for n0 = 0,
with ΓL = ΓR = Γ/2 and µL = µR = µ, are shown in Fig.
4. The case n0 = 1 is trivially obtained by adding n0e−Γt.
At long times, all the graphs approach the steady state
values given in Fig. 2. Again, the graphs for γ2 > U 2 are
almost the same as those without noise, e.g. the dashed
green lines in the ﬁgure.

Similar to the discussion before Eq.

The case µ = 0 is particularly interesting: it exhibits
a single exponential behavior, with no oscillation, and
is completely independent of the noise. To explain this,
look at Eq. (77). The time-dependent function δb(E, t)
consists of two oscillating terms, whose energy depen-
dence is of the form f (E, t)eiEt/D(E). The integral
−∞ dEf (E, t)eiEt/D(E) can be calculated by closing a
path in the upper half of the complex E−plane. The
poles of the denominator are at −iΓ±/2 for γ2 > U 2
In both
cases, these poles are in the lower half of the complex
E−plane, hence this integral vanishes, and therefore also
−∞ dE[δB(E, t)] = 0. Only the ﬁrst term in Eq. (79)
survives, so that hQ0(0, t)i = hQ0(0, ∞)i(1 − e−Γt) +
n0e−Γt, independent of the noise. If one wishes to avoid
the eﬀects of the noise, one should adjust to common
chemical potential to be at the “original” energy level on
the dot, µ = E0. Looking at graphs with µ 6= 0, one sees
that the oscillations decrease as |U | increases; the noise
smears the oscillations in the time evolution.

Substituting Eq. (80) into Eq. (39), the current in the
right lead is again given by Eq. (46). In the steady state
limit one has B(E, ∞) = B(E), Q0
0 (∞) = 0,
and we also reproduce Eq. (47). The ﬁrst term in Eq.
(46), sometimes called the “particle” current30, vanishes
at zero bias. It also vanishes if the quantum dot is con-
nected only to one lead (ΓL = 0 or ΓR = 0). In these
cases, one only has a transient current, which vanishes
at t → ∞. This transient current, sometimes called the

0(∞) = 0,

“displacement” current30,31, is given by

energies are in units of Γ.

are in units of Γ.

Figure 5 shows the transient displacement current IR,D
for a symmetric case, ΓL = ΓR = Γ/2, for the same
parameters as in Fig. 4. Again, the results for n0 = 1
are obtained by adding the ﬁrst term in Eq. (82). Again,
the oscillating terms are completely absent for µ = 0, and
they are smeared out as |U | increases. Figure 6 shows an
example of the time evolution of current in the left lead
for a ﬁnite bias. Except for the case U = −8, all the
graphs are close to those of the displacement current,
shown in Fig. 4, and approach the steady state current,
Eq. (47) and Fig. 3. The graph for U = −8 is diﬀerent,
because then the steady state transmission is close to the
resonance associated with the energy level −U/2 = −4,
and the ‘particle’ current feels this resonance already at
relatively short times.

VII. DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated that the SEA is convenient for
averaging over random time-dependent potentials in gen-
eral, and over telegraph noise in particular. In the present
paper we wanted to represent the method and emphasize
its advantages for open mesoscopic systems, and there-
fore we applied it to the simplest case of a single quantum
dot, a single ﬂuctuator, one path between the leads, spin-
less electrons and zero temperature. Needless to say, all
of these assumptions can be relieved.

In principle, we could follow Ref. 15, and calculate
the conditional probabilities for currents and charges to
reach diﬀerent values at time t. Here we preferred to sim-
plify the analysis, and calculate directly the averages over

these diﬀerent values. In the wide band approximation,
all the quantities of interest were found to be determined
by a single function b(E, t), which is obtained by solving
two coupled linear diﬀerential equations, and this led to
explicit simple expressions for the currents and charges.

Another possible generalization assumes diﬀerent jump
rates between the two levels15,22, or other distributions of
the random levels. The formalism can be easily adapted
to include such changes.

Even in the simplest case of resonant transmission
through a single quantum dot, the telegraph noise gen-
erates several interesting results, including the crossover
of the eﬀective Landauer transmission from that of a sin-
gle level to the incoherent sum of the transmissions of
the two levels, and the noise dependent eﬀects on the
transient time evolution of the charge on the dot and of
the currents in the leads. The relaxation rates of the
transients turn out to be directly related to the widths
of the peaks in the corresponding steady state conduc-
tance peaks. The noise broadens the peaks and increases
the relaxation rates. The noise also reduces the transient
temporary oscillations in the currents and charges. How-
ever, when the width of the noise distribution is very
large, the eﬀect of the noise on the system disappears.
Both the steady state and the transient results exhibit
interesting symmetries, Eqs. (73) and (81).

expected to cause
decoherence15. For a single path between the leads one
does not have a direct access to the phases of the wave
functions, except for the oscillations in the transient be-
havior of charges and currents, discussed after Eq. (77).
However, the discussion after Eq. (74), which compared
the noisy results for the steady-state current with the
coherent transport through two static levels, does indi-
cate a total loss of coherence.This issue will become much
clearer when we shall study the eﬀects of telegraph noise
on transport through an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer,
or through a Fano resonance. We plan to address these
issues in a future publication.

Appendix A: The Shapiro-Loginov formula

Since the Shapiro-Loginov diﬀerential formula23,24 is
essential for the treatment of noise in the framework of
our single-electron approach, this Appendix outlines its
derivation23, adopted for the speciﬁc system studied in
the present work. Consider a functional R[ξ(t), t] of a
random variable ξ(t). The average of this functional over
all the possible trajectories {ξ(t)} in a time-interval (0, t).
is denoted by hR[ξ(t), t]i. The Shapiro-Loginov formula
reads

hξ(t)R[ξ(t), t]i = hξ(t)

R[ξ(t), t]i − λ hξ(t)R[ξ(t), t]i ,

(A1)

and it is valid for diﬀerent random processes with expo-
nential correlation function hξ(t1)ξ(t2)i = exp[−λ|t1 −
t2|]. We used it in Eq. (59) in the case of telegraph
noise, with λ ≡ γ, for the evaluation of the functional

Let us multiply this equation by ξ(t) and average it

As a result we would arrive to the Shapiro-Loginov for-
mula, Eqs. (59), (A1).

Let us now demonstrate that Eq. (A8) indeed holds
for any n in the case of Markovian telegraph process.
We do it by extending Eq. (52) for multiple correlators
and using (50). Thus we can write

The last term vanishes after summation over ξ = ±1.
Then Eq. (A13) coincides with Eq. (A8).

25 The imaginary part of such shifts, have been used in the
literature to generate decoherence. In some cases (e.g. Refs.
26,27), the shifts indeed generate decoherence. However, in
many other cases the question whether imaginary energy
shifts are equivalent to decoherence mechanisms is still a
matter of debate, see e.g. P. W. Brouwer and C. W. J.
