1. INTRODUCTION

Higher representation theory consists of the study of actions of algebras, like Lie algebras or their
quantum enveloping algebras, on categories. After the pioneer work of Chuang and Rouquier [10] and
the parallel work of Frenkel, Khovanov and Stroppel [12], there have been various developments in
several directions and with different ﬂavors. One popular approach consists of using structures from
geometry to construct categorical actions of a Lie algebra. This is found already in the foundational
papers [10] and [12], where cohomologies of ﬁnite-dimensional Grassmannians and partial ﬂag va-
rieties play an important role in the categoriﬁcation of ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representations
of quantum sl2. In the context of algebraic geometry Cautis, Kamnitzer and Licata have deﬁned and
studied geometric categorical sl2-actions, and Zheng gave a categoriﬁcation of integral representations
of quantum groups [38] and of tensor products of sl2-modules [37].

In a remarkable series of papers, Khovanov and Lauda, and independently Rouquier, constructed
categoriﬁcations of all quantum Kac-Moody algebras [23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34] and some of their
2-representations [34]. In Khovanov and Lauda’s formulation the categoriﬁed quantum group is a
2-category 9U deﬁned diagrammatically by generators and relations. Khovanov and Lauda conjec-
tured that certain quotients of 9U categorify integrable representations of these quantum Kac-Moody
algebras. This conjecture was ﬁrst proved in ﬁnite type An by Brundan and Kleshshev [4]. Based
on Khovanov and Lauda, Rouquier and Zheng’s work, Webster gave in [36] a diagrammatic cate-
goriﬁcation of tensor products of integrable representations of symmetrizable quantum Kac-Moody
algebras and used it to categorify the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev link invariant. Moreover, he proved

Khovanov and Lauda’s conjecture on categoriﬁcation of integrable representations for all quantum
Kac-Moody algebras. This was also done independently by Kang and Kashiwara in [17].

One common feature of all the constructions above is that they all categorify ﬁnite-dimensional
representations in the ﬁnite type (in other types representations are locally ﬁnite-dimensional when
restricted to any simple root quantum sl2). In this paper we make a step towards a categoriﬁcation
of inﬁnite dimensional and non-integrable representations of quantum Kac-Moody algebras. We start
with the simplest case by proposing a framework for categoriﬁcation of the Verma modules for quan-
tum sl2.

Most of the geometric structures used in this paper were motivated by the geometric categoriﬁ-
cation of ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representations of sl2 in [12, Section 6] and the subsequent
constructions in [27] and [28]. In particular, the inspiration from Lauda’s work [27, 28] should be
clear.

Without further delays we now pass to describe our construction.

1.1. Sketch of the construction.

1.1.1. Verma modules. Let b be the Borel subalgebra of sl2, c a ﬁxed complex number and let λ “ qc
be a formal parameter. Denote by Cλ the 1-dimensional Uqpbq-module of weight λ, with E acting
trivially. The Verma module M pλq with highest weight λ is the induced module

M pλq “ Uqpsl2q bUqpbq Cλ.

In the special case when c is an integer number, say n, we use the standard notation M pnq instead
of M pqnq. The Verma module M pλq is irreducible unless c is a non-negative integer. When c “
n P N0 the Verma module M pnq contains M p´n ´ 2q as a unique submodule and the quotient
M pnq{M p´n ´ 2q is isomorphic to the irreducible Uqpsl2q-module V pnq of dimension n ` 1.

1.1.2. Categoriﬁcation of the weight spaces of M pλq´1q. Throughout this paper we work over the
ﬁeld of rationals Q. Let Gk be the Grassmannian of k-planes in C8 and HpGkq its cohomology with
rational coefﬁcients. It is a graded ring freely generated by the Chern classes xk “ px1, . . . , xkq with
degpxiq “ 2i. The ring HpGkq has a unique irreducible module up to isomorphism and grading shift,
which is isomorphic to Q. Let ExtHpGkqpQ, Qq denote the algebra of self-extensions of Q and for
k ě 0, deﬁne

We have

Ωk “ HpGkq b ExtHpGkqpQ, Qq.

Ωk – Qrxks b Λ‚pskq,

which we regard as a Z ˆ Z-graded superring with even generators xi with degpxiq “ p2i, 0q and odd
generators si with degpsiq “ p´2i, 2q (the ﬁrst grading is quantum and the second cohomological).
We denote by xr, sy the grading shift up by r units on the quantum grading and by s units on the
cohomological grading. In the sequel we use the term bigrading for a Z ˆ Z-grading.

The ring Ωk has a unique irreducible supermodule up to isomorphism and grading shift, which is
isomorphic to Q, and a unique projective indecomposable supermodule, again up to isomorphism and
grading shift, which is isomorphic to Ωk.

Let Ωk -smodlf be the category of locally ﬁnite-dimensional, bigraded, bounded from below Ωk-
supermodules. It is the full subcategory of all bigraded Ωk-supermodules consisting of objects which
are ﬁnite-dimensional in each degree. In this context it makes sense to speak of the q-adic completed
0pΩk -smodlfq. Here as usual G0pCq is used to denote
Grothendieck groups Gc

0pΩk -smodlfq and K c

Categoriﬁcation of Verma modules

the Grothendieck group of an abelian category C and K0pCq the split Grothendieck group of C. We
have that both Gc

0pΩk -smodlfq are one-dimensional.

0pΩk -smodlfq and K c

For each non-negative integer k we deﬁne Mk “ Ωk -smodlf and take Mk as a categoriﬁcation of

the pc ´ 1 ´ 2kqth-weight space.

1.1.3. The categorical sl2-action. To construct functors F and E that move between categories Mk
we look for superrings Ωk`1,k and (natural) maps

,

‚ Ωk`1,k is a free left Ωk`1-supermodule of bigraded superdimension rk ` 1s.

Remark 1.1. The superring HpGk,k`1q b ExtHpGk,k`1qpQ, Qq does not have these properties.

Let Gk,k`1 be the inﬁnite partial ﬂag variety

Gk,k`1 “ tpUk, Uk`1q| dimC Uk “ k, dimC Uk`1 “ k ` 1, 0 Ă Uk Ă Uk`1 Ă C8u.

Its rational cohomology is a graded ring, generated by the Chern classes:

This gives Ωk`1,k the structure of an pΩk`1, Ωkq-superbimodule. We write Ωk,k`1 for Ωk`1,k when
seen as an pΩk, Ωk`1q-superbimodule. It is easy to see that up to an overall shift, the ring Ωk,k`1 has
the desired properties.

For each k ě 0 deﬁne exact functors Fk : Mk Ñ Mk`1 and Ek : Mk`1 Ñ Mk by

and

Ekp´q “ Resk`1,k

k

˝ Ωk,k`1 bΩk`1 p´qxk ` 2, ´1y.

The functors pF, Eq form an adjoint pair up to grading shifts, but F has no left adjoint and E has no
right adjoint. We would like to stress that this is necessary to prevent us from falling in the situation
of Q-strong 2-representations from [9]. In that case, our construction would lift to a 2-representation
of 9U and Rouquier’s results in [34] would imply that if the functor E kills a highest weight then its
biadjoint functor would kill a lowest weight (this can be proved with a clever trick using degree zero
bubbles to tunnel from the lowest weight to the highest weight1).

Denote by Ωkrξs the polynomial ring in ξ with coefﬁcients in Ωk and by Qk the functor of tensoring
on the left with the locally ﬁnite-dimensional pΩk, Ωkq-superbimodule ΠΩkrξsx1, 0y, where Π is the
parity change functor. The categorical sl2-action is encoded in an exact sequence of functors,
0 ÝÝÑ Fk´1 ˝ Ek´1 ÝÝÑ Ek ˝ Fk ÝÝÑ Qkx´2k ´ 1, 1y ‘ ΠQkx2k ` 1, ´1y ÝÝÑ 0.

From the work of Lauda in [27, 28] adjusted to our context it follows that for each n ě 0 there is
an action of the nilHecke algebra NHn on Fn and on En. As a matter of fact, there is an enlargement
of NHn, which we denote An, acting on Fn and En, also admitting a nice diagrammatic description
(see subsection 1.1.6 below for a sketch).

We deﬁne M as the direct sum of all the Mk’s and functors F, E and Q in the obvious way. One

of the main results in this paper is the following.
Theorem 5.10. The functors F and E induce an action of quantum sl2 on the Grothendieck groups
0pMq are isomorphic with the Verma module
Gc
M pλq´1q.

0pMq. With this action Gc

0pMq and K c

0pMq and K c

Form the 2-category M whose objects are the categories Mk, the 1-morphisms are direct sums
of shifts of functors from tEk, Fk, Qk, Idku and the 2-morphisms are (grading preserving) natural
transformations of functors. In this case we rephrase Theorem 5.10 and say that the 2-category M
is a 2-representation of sl2 that categoriﬁes the Verma module M pλq´1q. We stress that this is not a
2-representation in the usual sense [34, 9] since functors F and E are not biadjoint, as explained above.

1We thank Aaron Lauda for explaining this to us.

1.1.4. Categoriﬁcation of the Verma module with integral highest weight. Forgetting the cohomolo-
gical degree on the superrings Ωk and Ωk,k`1 deﬁnes a forgetful functor into the category of locally
ﬁnite-dimensional Z-graded Ωkp´1q-supermodules, where Ωp´1q is the ring Ω with the cohomolog-
ical degree collapsed. This deﬁnes a category Mp´1q. A direct consequence of Theorem 5.11 is that
the Grothendieck groups Gc

0pMq are isomorphic to the Verma module M p´1q.

0pMq and K c

Our strategy to categorify M pnq is to ﬁrst deﬁne for each n P Z certain sub-superrings Ωkpnq
and Ωk,k`1pnq of Ωk and Ωk,k`1, that agree with the superrings above for n “ ´1, and such that
the obvious application of our procedure as before results in a categoriﬁcation of the Verma module
M pλqnq. We then apply the forgetful functor to deﬁne a category Mpnq that categoriﬁes M pnq on
the nose. But we can do better.

Killing all objects of Mpnq with zero graded superdimension deﬁnes a new category Mpnq. Func-
tors Fk, Ek and Qk descend to exact functors on Mpnq and we have a nice short exact sequence of
functors,

0 ÝÝÑ Fk´1 ˝ Ek´1 ÝÝÑ Ek ˝ Fk ÝÝÑ ‘rn´2ks Idk ÝÝÑ 0,

with the convention that ‘r´isA “ ‘risΠA. As in the case of M, for each m ě 0 there is an action
of the nilHecke algebra NHm and of its enlargement on Fm and on Em. Another main result in this
paper is the following.
Theorems 6.11 and 6.12. For n ă 0 the Grothendieck groups Gc
with the action induced by functors F and E, are isomorphic to the Verma module M pnq.

0pMpnqq, together

0pMpnqq and K c

For n ě 0 the Grothendieck group K c

0pMpnqq, together with the action induced by functors F and
E, is isomorphic to M pnq. Moreover, passing to the full subcategories PMp´n ´ 2q of PMpnq of
Mp´n ´ 2q of Mpnq consisting of projective objects, there is a sub 2-representation PMp´n ´ 2q of
PMpnq with Grothendieck group K c
0pPMp´n ´ 2qq isomorphic to the Verma module M p´n ´ 2q.
1.1.5. A categoriﬁcation of the pn ` 1q-dimensional irreducible representation from Mpλq. To re-
cover the categoriﬁcation of the ﬁnite dimensional irreducible V pnq from [10] and [12] we deﬁne for
each n P N0 a differential dn on the superrings Ωk and Ωk,k`1, turning them in DG-rings. These
DG-rings are quasi-isomorphic to the cohomologies of ﬁnite dimensional Grassmannians and 1-step
ﬂag manifolds in Cn, as in the known cases of [10, 12]. The nilHecke algebra action descends to the
usual nilHecke algebra action on integrable 2-representations of sl2 (see [9, 27, 28, 34]).

The differential dn descends to the superrings Ωkpnq and Ωk,k`1pnq and to Mpnq yielding the same
result as in M. Turning on the differential makes the image of PMp´n ´ 2q in PMpnq contractible.

1.1.6. A diagrammatic presentation of the enlarged nilHecke algebra. The enlarged nilHecke algebra
An can be given a presentation in the spirit of KLR algebras [23, 27, 34] as isotopy classes of diagrams
modulo some relations.

Our diagrams are isotopy classes of KLR diagrams with some extra structure. Besides the KLR
dots we have another type of dot we call a white dot (we keep the name dot for the KLR dots). White
dots are made to satisfy the exterior algebra relations (see below). The enlarged algebra is in fact a
bigraded superalgebra, were the nilHecke generators are even and the white dot is odd. Moreover,
regions in a diagram are labeled with integer numbers with the convention that the label at the right of
a strand is the one on left plus 1:

k

k ` 1

6

Gr´egoire Naisse and Pedro Vaz

The k-superalgebra An consists of k-linear combinations of n-strand diagrams as described above.
The multiplication is given by concatenation of diagrams whenever the labels of the regions agree
and zero otherwise. In our conventions, ab means stacking the diagram for a atop of the one for b
whenever they are composable. The superalgebra An is bigraded with the q-degree of the white dot
depending on the label of the region at his right:

deg˜ k

¸ “ p2, 0q,

deg˜ k

¸ “ p2k ´ 2, 2q,

deg˜ k

¸ “ p´2, 0q.

All other isotopies are allowed (e.g. switching the relative height of a dot and a white dot). The
relations above respect the grading.

We deﬁne Anpmq as the sub-superalgebra consisting of all diagrams with label m at the left most

region and

Apmq “àně0

Anpmq,

The usual inclusion Anpmq ãÑ An`1pmq that adds a strand at the right of a diagram from Anpmq
gives rise to induction and restriction functors on Apmq -smodlf that satisfy the sl2-relations. Our
results imply that the sl2 2-representation Apmq -smodlf categoriﬁes the Verma module Mpλqmq.
The categoriﬁcation of the Verma modules with integral highest weight using the algebras An follows
as a consequence of our results.

Following [27, Subsections 2.1-2.2] we now introduce some important algebra automorphisms on

Uqpsl2q. Using the notations from [27], let q, ψ and τ be as follows:

‚ q is the Q-linear involution of Qpqq that maps q to q´1.
‚ ψ is the Qpqq-antilinear algebra automorphism of Uqpsl2q given by

ψpEq “ E,

ψpF q “ F,

ψpKq “ K ´1,

ψppXq “ pψpXq,

for p P Qpqq and X P Uqpsl2q.

‚ τ : Uqpsl2q Ñ U psl2qop is the Qpqq antilinear antiautomorphism given by

τ pEq “ q´1K ´1F,

τ pF q “ q´1KE,

τ pKq “ K ´1,

and

τ ppXq “ pτ pXq,

for p P Qpqq and X P Uqpsl2q,

τ pXY q “ τ pY qτ pXq,

for X, Y P Uqpsl2q.

The inverse of τ is given by τ ´1pEq “ q´1F K, τ ´1pF q “ q´1EK ´1, τ ´1pKq “ K ´1.
2.2. Deformed idempotented Uqpsl2q. For µ a ﬁxed complex number the shifted weight lattice is
µ ` Z. For n P Z we denote by en the idempotent corresponding to the projection onto the pµ ` nq-th
weight space. K acts on this weight space as multiplication by qµ`n:

Writing λ for the formal parameter qµ this equation takes the more suggestive form

The extension to the deformed version of idempotented sl2 of the bilinear form x, y in [27, Subsec-

tion 2.3] is straightforward. The following is the analogous of [27, Proposition 2.4] in our context.
Proposition 2.3. There is a pairing x , y :

9Uλ ˆ 9Uλ Ñ Zpqqrλ˘1s with the properties:

(1) x , y is semilinear, that is,

xpX, Y y “ pxX, Y y, xX, pY y “ pxX, Y y for p P Zpqqrλ˘1s and X, Y P 9Uλ;

(2) Hom property: xenXem, en1 Y em1y “ 0 for all X, Y P 9Uλ unless n “ n1 and m “ m1;
(3) Adjoint property: xuX, Y y “ xX, τ puqY y for u P Uqpsl2q and X, Y P 9Uλ;

(4) Grassmannian property: xEpaqen, Epaqeny “ xF paqen, F paqeny “

;

(5) We have xX, Y y “ xψpY q, ψpXqy for all X, Y P 9Uλ.
Notice that all the occurrences of λ in x , y are encoded in τ (Property (3)). For example,

2.4. Representations. We only consider modules of type I in this paper. For a complex number c
we write λ “ qc and treat it as a formal parameter. For each such λ there is an inﬁnite dimensional
Uqpsl2q weight-module M pλq with highest weight λ, called a Verma module. Let b be the Borel
subalgebra of sl2 and let Cλ be a 1-dimensional representation of Uqpbq with E acting trivially and K
by weight λ. The Verma module M pλq with highest weight λ is the induced module

It has basis m0, m1, . . . , mk, . . . such that for all i ě 0

The Verma module M pλq is irreducible unless c “ n P N. To keep the notation simple we write
In this case HomUqpsl2qpM pn1q, M pnqq is zero unless
M pnq instead of M pqnq whenever c P Z.
n1 “ ´n ´ 2 and there is a homomorphism φ : M p´n ´ 2q Ñ M pnq, uniquely determined up to
scalar multiples. The quotient M pnq{M p´n ´ 2q is isomorphic to the irreducible Uqpsl2q-module
V pnq of dimension n ` 1 and all ﬁnite-dimensional irreducibles can be obtained this way. Under
this quotient, the canonical basis of M pnq descends to a particular case of Lusztig-Kashiwara canon-
ical basis in ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representations of quantum groups introduced in [30] and
independently in [21].

The Verma module M pλq is universal in the sense that any given Verma module with integral
highest weight can be obtained from M pλq. The means for each n P Z there is an evaluation map
evn : M pλq Ñ M pnq which is a surjection (see [33] and also [20, 16] for details) .

Throughout this paper we will take M pλq´1q as the universal Verma module and we will call
M pλq´1`nq (n P Z) the shifted Verma modules (see [33] for details). In our conventions, evaluating
M pλq´1q at n means putting λ “ qn`1. The evaluation map evn is then the composite of a shift
with ev´1.

2.5. Bilinear form. The universal Shapovalov form x´, ´yλ (see for example [33]) is the bilinear
form on M pλq´1q such that for any m, m1 P M pλq, u P Uqpsl2q, and f P Qpqqrλ, λ´1s we have

‚ xm0, m0yλ “ 1,
‚ xum, m1yλ “ xm, τ puqm1yλ, where τ is the q-antilinear antiautomorphism deﬁned in Equa-

tion (1),

‚ f xm, m1yλ “ x ¯f m, m1yλ “ xm, f m1yλ, where ´ is the Q-linear involution of Qpqqrλ, λ´1s

Evaluation of M pλq´1q at n ` 1 reduces to the well-known Qpqq-valued bilinear form (see [33]
and [35] for the original deﬁnition in the non-quantum context as well as a proof of uniqueness). The
q-Shapovalov form x´, ´yn is the unique bilinear form on M pnq such that for any m, m1 P M pnq,
u P Uqpsl2q, and f P Qpqq we have

cannot be applied on M pnq but can be used in the ﬁnite dimensional quotient V pnq yielding the
the usual dual canonical basis of ﬁnite-dimensional representations, up to a normalization (see for
example the exposition in [12, Section 1.2]).

3. THE GEOMETRY OF THE INFINITE GRASSMANNIAN

3.1. Grassmannians and their Ext algebras. Let Gk be the Grassmannian variety of k-planes in
C8. This space classiﬁes k-dimensional complex vector bundles over a manifold N , in the sense that
there is a tautological bundle over Gk, and every k-dimensional vector bundle over N is a pull-back of
the tautological bundle by some map from N to Gk. Since this pull-back is invariant under homotopy
we actually study homotopy classes of maps from N to Gk. The cohomology ring of Gk is generated
by the Chern classes (see for example [32, Chapter 14] for details),

HpGkq – Qrx1,k, . . . , xk,k, Y1,k, . . . , Yi,k, . . . s{Ik,8,

where Ik,8 is the ideal generated the homogeneous components in t satisfying the equation
(7)
This ring is Z-graded with with degqpxi,kq “ degqpYi,kq “ 2i. We denote by x1y the grading shift up
by 1. Notice that (7) gives recursively

p1 ` x1,kt ` . . . ` xk,ktkqp1 ` Y1,kt ` . . . ` Yi,kti ` . . . q “ 1.

with Yă0,k “ 0, Y0,k “ 1 and xąk,k “ 0. Since every Yi,k can be written as a combination of xj,k, we
have

Now let Gk,k`1 be the inﬁnite partial ﬂag variety

HpGkq – Qrx1,k, . . . , xk,ks.

Gk,k`1 “ tpUk, Uk`1q| dimC Uk “ k, dimC Uk`1 “ k ` 1, 0 Ă Uk Ă Uk`1 Ă C8u.

As it turns out, the inﬁnite Grassmannian Gk is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space BU pkq
of the unitary group U pkq, and we have a ﬁbration

F Ñ BU pkq ˆ BU p1q Ñ BU pk ` 1q

induced by the inclusion U pkq ˆ U p1q Ñ U pk ` 1q. The ﬁbre has the homotopy type of the quotient
U pk ` 1q{pU pkq ˆ U p1qq and corresponds to Gk,k`1 in the sense that specifying Uk Ă Uk`1 in C8
corresponds to specifying Uk in C8 and a 1-dimensional Grassmannian in Uk. As a consequence, we
get that the cohomology of F , and therefore of Gk,k`1, is generated by the Chern classes

HpGk,k`1q – Qrw1,k, . . . , wk,k, ξk`1, Z1,k`1, . . . , Zi,k`1, . . . s{Ik,k`1,8

with Ik,k`1,8 generated by the equation

p1 ` w1,kt ` . . . ` wk,ktkqp1 ` ξk`1tqp1 ` Z1,k`1t ` . . . ` Zi,k`1ti ` . . . q “ 1.

Without surprise, HpGk,k`1q has a natural structure of a Z-graded ring with
degqpwi,kq “ degqpZi,k`1q “ 2i, degqpξq “ 2.
Again, we can write every Zi,k`1 as a combination of wj,k and ξk`1 to get

HpGk,k`1q – Qrw1,k, . . . , wk,k, ξk`1s.

The ring HpGkq is a graded positive Noetherian ring which has a unique simple module, up to
isomorphism and grading shift, HpGkq{HpGkq` – Q, where HpGkq` is the submodule of HpGkq
generated by the elements of nonzero degree. Let ExtHpGkqpQ, Qq be the algebra of self-extensions
of Q, which is an exterior algebra in k variables,

ExtHpGkqpQ, Qq “Ź‚ps1,k, . . . , sk,kq.

It is a Z ˆ Z-graded ring with degqpsi,kq “ ´2i and degλpsi,kq “ 2. The ﬁrst grading is induced by
the grading in HpGkq while the second grading is cohomological. Sometimes we write degλ,qpxq for
the ordered pair pdegλpxq, degqpxqq.

Deﬁnition 3.1. For each k “ 0, 1, . . . we form the bigraded rings

Ωk “ HpGkq b ExtHpGkqpQ, Qq,

and

Ωk,k`1 “ HpGk,k`1q b ExtHpGk`1qpQ, Qq.

Note we do not use extensions of HpGk,k`1q-modules and also that Ωk is isomorphic to the Ho-
chschild cohomology of HpGkq. In order to ﬁx some notation and avoid any possibility of confusion
in future computations we ﬁx presentations of these rings as

Ωk “ Qrxk, sks,

and

Ωk,k`1 “ Qrwk, ξk`1, σk`1s,

where we write tm for an array t1,m, . . . , tm,m of m variables and where it is implied that the variables
si and σi are anticommutative.

12

Rings Ωk and Ωk,k`1 are in fact (supercommutative rings) superrings with an inherent Z2-grading,

called parity, given by

for wi, ξk`1 and σi P Ωk,k`1.

3.2. Superbimodules. Let R be a superring. We deﬁne a left (resp. right) R-supermodule as a Z2-
graded left (resp. right) R-module. A left supermodule map f : M Ñ N is a homogeneous group
homomorphism that supercommutes with the action of R,

f pr ‚ mq “ p´1qppf qpprqr ‚ f pmq,

for all r P R and m P M. A right supermodule map is a homogeneous right module homomorphism.
An pR, R1q-superbimodule is both a left R-supermodule and a right R1-supermodule, with compatible
actions. A superbimodule map is both a left supermodule map and a right supermodule map.

Then, if R has a supercommutative ring structure and if we view it as an pR, Rq-superbimodule,

multiplying at left by an element of R gives rise to a superbimodule endomorphism.

Let M and N be respectively an pR1, Rq and an pR, R2q-superbimodules. One form their tensor
product over R in the usual way for bimodules, giving a superbimodule. Given two superbimodule
maps f : M Ñ M 1 and g : N Ñ N 1, we can form the tensor product f b g : M b N Ñ M 1 b N 1,
which is deﬁned by

pf b gqpb b mq :“ p´1qppgqppbqf pbq b gpmq

and gives a superbimodule map.

Now deﬁne the parity shift of a supermodule M, denoted ΠM “ tπpmq|m P M u, where πpmq is
the element m with the parity inversed, and if M is a left supermodule (or superbimodule) with left
action given by

r ‚ πpmq “ p´1qpprqπpr ‚ mq
for r P R and m P M. The action on the right remains the same.

In this context, the map R Ñ ΠR deﬁned by r ÞÑ πparq for some odd element a P R is a grading

preserving homomorphism of pR, Rq-superbimodules.

Let π : M Ñ ΠM denote the change of parity map x ÞÑ πpxq. It is a supermodule maps with
parity 1 and satisﬁes π2 “ Id. The map π b π : ΠM b N Ñ M b ΠN is grading preserving and
such that pπ b πq2 “ ´ Id, thus

ΠpM b N q – ΠM b N – M b ΠN

are isomorphisms of supermodules. All the above is presented with a more categorical ﬂavour in [11,
18] (see also [19]), showing that the supermodules and superbimodules gives supercategories.

3.3. Graded dimensions. A Z ˆ Z-graded supermodule

M “ ài,j,k P,ZˆZˆZ2

Mi,j,k

is locally of ﬁnite rank if each Mi,j,k has ﬁnite rank. The same notion applies for bigraded vector
spaces. We denote M xr, sy the supermodule with the q-grading shifted up by r and the λ-grading
shifted up by s.

In the context of locally ﬁnite rank supermodules and vector spaces it makes sense to talk about
graded ranks and graded dimensions. In the cases under consideration the graded dimension of M is
the Poincar´e series

Sometimes it is useful to consider a direct sum of objects (e.g. supermodules or superbimodules)
where the q-degree of each summand has been shifted by a different amount. In this case we use the

notion of shifting an object by a Laurent polynomial: given f “ř fjqj P Nrq, q´1s we write ‘f M

or M ‘f for the direct sum over j P Z of fj copies of M xj, 0y.

As expected, maps φ˚

these rings are supercommutative we can also think of Ωk,k`1 as an pΩk`1, Ωkq-superbimodule which
we denote by Ωk`1,k. When dealing with tensor products of superbimodules we simplify the notation
and write bk for bΩk and b for bQ.

We use the notation smod-Ωk and Ωk -smod for right and left Ωk-supermodules respectively. As a
right Ωk-supermodule Ωk`1,k – Qrξk`1, sk`1sbΩk is a free graded supermodule, which is of locally

Superbimodule Ωk,k`1 is sweet. Recall that a superbimodule is sweet if it is projective as a left su-
permodule and as a right supermodule. Tensoring with a superbimodule is exact and send projectives
to projectives if and only if the superbimodule is sweet.

Let Ωk -smodlf be the category of graded, left Ωk-supermodules which are of locally ﬁnite rank.
Let also Ωk,k`1 -smodlf be the corresponding category for Ωk,k`1. Since the variable ξk`1 coming
from the restriction of Ωk,k`1 to Ωk commutes with all variables in Ωk and the variable sk`1,k`1
supercommutes with all variables in Ωk the ring Ωkrξk`1, sk`1s can be given a canonical structure
of pΩk, Ωkq-superbimodule. The functor of induction from Ωk -smodlf to Ωk,k`1 -smodlf and then
restricting back to Ωk -smodlf is isomorphic to tensoring on the left with Ωkrξk`1, sk`1s.

Lemma 3.2. The superring Ωk,k`1,...,k`m is a bigraded pΩk, Ωk`mq-superbimodule, which is iso-
morphic to Ωk,k`1 bk`1 Ωk`1,k`2 bk`2 ¨ ¨ ¨ bk`n´1 Ωk`n´1,k`n.

As in other instances of categorical sl2-actions, the pΩk, Ωkq-superbimodules Ωk,k`1 bk`1 Ωk`1,k
and Ωk,k´1 bk´1 Ωk´1,k are related through a categorical version of the commutator relation (4). To
make our formulas simpler when dealing with tensor products of superbimodules we write Ωkpk`1qk
instead of Ωk,k`1 bk`1 Ωk`1,k and Ωkpk´1qk instead of Ωk,k´1 bk´1 Ωk´1,k.

To be able to state and proof this categorical version of the commutator in SBimλ, we need some

preparation.

are both of degree p´2, 0q.

Lemma 4.12. For all i, j ě 0 we have

and thus

X ˘pξi`1 bk`1 ξj`1q “ ξX ˘pξi bk`1 ξjqξ.

Proof. The proof is a direct computation, which is done in [27, Lemma 7.10].

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.13. The maps X ´ and X ` are superbimodule morphisms.

Proof. Since by deﬁnition X ´ is a right supermodule morphism, we only need to prove that it is also
a left supermodule morphism. This means that we have to show that

such that both superbimodule maps are equal. Finally, injectivity follows from the fact that as groups,
Ωkpk´1qk and Ωkpk`1qk are free.
(cid:3)

Thanks to the injection u we see that Ωkpk´1qk is a sub-superbimodule of Ωkpk`1qk and we deﬁne

Proof. We have to show that im u Ă ker µ and im u Ă ker π. By Lemma 4.3, it is sufﬁcient to show
that the maps µ and π are zero on 1 bk`1 1, ξk bk`1 1, . . . , ξk´1

the deﬁnition of these maps.

Proof. To show injectivity, we only have to prove that im ι X im u “ t0u which is straightforward,
since by Lemma 4.3 there isn’t any occurrence of ξěk

immediate.

since sk,k`1 commutes. The invertibility is immediate from the deﬁnition the maps.

Lemma 4.19. The equalities

Proof. The Lemmas 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18 and 4.19 above imply that that µ ‘ π is a split surjection
with inverse µ´1 ‘ ι and that the dimensions agree, and so it is an isomorphism.

Remark 4.21. We do not have a direct sum decomposition

Ωkpk`1qk ﬂ Ωkpk´1qk ‘ ΠΩξ

because there is no surjective morphism Ωkpk`1qk Ñ Ωkpk´1qk. As a matter of fact, there is no
injective morphism Ωk Ñ Ωkpk´1qk either.

Deﬁnition 4.22. Deﬁne the shifted superbimodules

Proof. By Lemma 4.2, there are decompositions as left supermodules

Categoriﬁcation of Verma modules

We conclude by combining these two decompositions. The proof is similar for the decomposition as
right supermodules.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.25. The decompositions as a left and as a right supermodule are similar but the splitting
maps are not superbimodule maps (c.f. with Remark 4.21).

4.2. nilHecke action. The nilHecke algebra NHn, which appears in the context of cohomologies of
ﬂag varieties and Schubert varieties (see for example [26, Section 4]), is an essential ingredient in the
categoriﬁcation of quantum groups and has become quite ubiquitous in higher representation theory.
Recall that it is the unital, associative k-algebra freely generated by xj for 1 ď j ď n and Bj for
1 ď j ď n ´ 1 with relations

(21)

xixj “ xjxi,
Bixj “ xjBi

if |i ´ j| ą 1,

BiBj “ BjBi

Bixi “ xi`1Bi ` 1,
xiBi “ Bixi`1 ` 1,

B2
i “ 0,

BiBi`1Bi “ Bi`1BiBi`1.

Here k is a ring which, unless stated otherwise, we will take as Q.

Proposition 4.26. There is an action of the nilHecke algebra NHn on Ωm,m`n.

Proof. We view Ωm,m`n as Ωm,m`1 b ¨ ¨ ¨ b Ωm`n´1,m`n using the Lemma 3.2. Let Bi act as the
operator X ´ : Ωm`i´1,m`i bΩm`i,m`i`1 Ñ Ωm`i´1,m`ibΩm`i,m`i`1 and xi as multiplication by
ξm`i in Ωm`i´1,m`i. We get all the relations in 21 from the superbimodule structure of the morphism
X ´ together with Lemma 4.12, except for the bottom two on the right column, which can be checked
through computations similar to those in [27, Lemma 7.10].
(cid:3)

As a matter of fact, there is an enlarged version of the nilHecke algebra acting on Ωm,m`n, and
therefore also on Ωm`n,k. From the proof of Proposition 4.13 we see that the nilHecke algebra NHn

degλ,qpωjq “ p´2pj ` mq, 2q. More precisely, ωj is identiﬁed with sm`j,m`j P Ωm`j´1,m`j.
Deﬁnition 4.27. We deﬁne the bigraded superalgebra Anpmq as the quotient of the product algebra

as deﬁned above acts on the ring Qrxn, ωns “ Qrxns bŹ‚pωnq, where ωj is odd and has bidegree
of NHn withŹ‚pωnq by the kernel of the action of NHn on Qrxn, ωns.

The algebra Anpmq inherits many of the features of NHn, like the fact that it is left and right
noetherian and is free as a left module over Qrxn, Ωns and Qrxns, of ranks n! and 2nn! respectively.
It can be given a presentation by generators and relations as the unital, associative, bigraded k-(super)
algebra freely generated by even elements xj, for 1 ď j ď n, and Bj, for 1 ď j ď n ´ 1, and
odd elements ωj, for 1 ď j ď n, with bidegrees degλ,qpxiq “ p2, 0q, degλ,qpBiq “ p´2, 0q and
degλ,qpωiq “ p´2pi ` kq, 2q. These generators are subject to the nilHecke relations (21), together
with:

and

Biωj “$&%

ωiBi ` ωi`1pxi`1Bi ´ Bixi`1q

Of course, all the above applies almost unchanged to Ωm`n,m. The algebra Anpmq is studied in more
detail in Section 8.

5. CATEGORIFICATION OF THE VERMA MODULE M pλq

5.1. The Verma categoriﬁcation. Each of the superrings Ωk is a noetherian Z ˆ Z-graded local
ring whose degree p0, 0q part is isomorphic to Q. Then every graded projective supermodule (not
necessarily ﬁnitely-generated) is a free graded supermodule [5, Prop. 1.5.15], and Ωk has (up to
isomorphism and grading shift) a unique graded indecomposable projective supermodule.

From now on and unless stated otherwise all supermodules we consider are assumed to be locally
ﬁnite-dimensional. These are graded supermodules which are ﬁnite-dimensional in each degree. No-
tice that a locally ﬁnite-dimensional supermodule is not necessarily ﬁnitely-generated.

Every graded projective supermodule P of Ωk is of the form P – Ωk b A where A is a graded
locally ﬁnite-dimensional abelian group. The ring Ωk has (up to isomorphism and grading shift) a
unique simple supermodule Sk “ Ωk{pΩkq` (here pΩkq` denotes the submodule of Ωk generated
by the elements of nonzero bidegree). A (bi)graded supermodule M “ ‘i,jMi,j is left bounded (or
bounded from below) if there are integers m and n such that Mi,j “ 0 for i ă m and j ă n. Every left
bounded graded Ωk-supermodule has a projective cover [6, Thm. 2]. As a matter of fact, it is not hard
to construct such a projective cover. For left bounded Ωk-supermodule M form the non-trivial graded
abelian group M {ppΩkq`M q – Q bΩk M and form P “ Ωk b Q bΩk M. Then P is a projective
cover of M with the surjection p : P Ñ M given by a b b b m ÞÑ aσpb b mq where σ is a section of
the canonical projection M Ñ M {ppΩkq`M q – Q bΩk M.

Let Ωk -smodlf be the abelian Z ˆ Z-graded category of such supermodules whose Hom spaces
are given by the grading preserving supermodule maps. It has the Krull-Schmidt property for di-
rect sum decompositions of supermodules. The (completed) Grothendieck groups Gc
0pΩk -smodlfq
0pΩk -smodlfq (see Subsection 5.3) are both one-dimensional and freely generated by the one
and K c
dimensional simple supermodule Sk, and the unique projective indecomposable Ωk, respectively.

Proposition 5.1. Up to a grading shift the functors pFk, Ekq form an adjoint pair of functors.

Proof. The superbimodules maps η and ǫ from Deﬁnitions 4.5 and 4.8 induce respectively natural
transformations 1k Ñ EkFk and FkEk Ñ 1k`1 which are the unit and counit of the adjunction
Fk % Ek by Remark 4.9.
(cid:3)

The functor F has no left adjoint and E has no right adjoint. As explained in Subsection 1.1.3 this

is necessary to categorify inﬁnite-dimensional highest weight sl2-modules.

We denote by Qk the functor Mk Ñ Mk of tensoring on the left with the shifted pΩk, Ωkq-

superbimodule Ω

ξ
k. In the context of category M, Corollary 4.23 reads as follows.

Proposition 5.2. For each k P N0 we have an exact sequence

0 ÝÝÑ Fk´1 ˝ Ek´1 ÝÝÑ Ek ˝ Fk ÝÝÑ Qkx´2k ´ 1, 1y ‘ ΠQkx2k ` 1, ´1y ÝÝÑ 0.

Since the superbimodules used to construct Fk and Ek are sweet, see Proposition 4.24, we have the

following.

Corollary 5.3. For every M P Mk we have an isomorphism

Ek ˝ FkpM q – Fk´1 ˝ Ek´1pM q ‘ QkpM qx´2k ´ 1, 1y ‘ ΠQkpM qx2k ` 1, ´1y.

Deﬁne the functor Kk as the endofunctor of Mk which is the auto-equivalence that shifts the

bidegree by p´2k ´ 1, 1q

Kk : Mk Ñ Mk,

Kkp´q “ p´qx´2k ´ 1, 1y.

We have isomorphisms Kk ˝ Ek – Ek ˝ Kk`1x2, 0y and Kk`1 ˝ Fk – Fk ˝ Kkx´2, 0y. Moreover, since
Π ˝ Qk – Qk ˝ Π we have ΠQk ˝ Kk – Qk ˝ ΠKk.

Deﬁnition 5.4. Deﬁne the category M and the endofunctors F, E, K and Q, as

All the above adds up to the following.

E “àkě0

Theorem 5.5. We have natural isomorphisms of functors

K ˝ E – E ˝ Kx2, 0y,

K ˝ F – F ˝ Kx´2, 0y,

and an exact sequence

0 ÝÝÑ F ˝ E ÝÝÑ E ˝ F ÝÝÑ Q ˝`K ‘ ΠK´1˘ ÝÝÑ 0.

Remark 5.6. Theorem 5.5 is suggestive from the point of view of categoriﬁcation of the deformed
version 9Uλ of quantum sl2 from Subsection 2.2 if we identify Mk with the pµ ´ 2kq-th weight space

5.2. NilHecke action. In Subsection 4.2 we constructed an action of the nilHecke algebra NHn on
the superbimodules Ωk,k`n and Ωk`n,k. The deﬁnition of Fk and Ek imply the following.
Proposition 5.7. The nilHecke algebra action on Ωk,k`n descends to an action on Fm and on Em.

5.3. Grothendieck groups. The notion of taking a completion of the Grothendieck group was intro-
duced in [1] (see also [13]) to give a context to the Euler characteristic when working with certain
inﬁnite complexes. For a category C we denote by G0pCq its Grothendieck group, which is by def-
inition the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes rCs of objects C in C modulo
the relation rBs “ rAs ` rCs whenever there is an exact sequence 0 Ñ A Ñ B Ñ C Ñ 0. We
denote by K0pCq the split Grothendieck group of C which is the free abelian group generated by the
isomorphism classes rCs of objects C in C modulo the relation rBs “ rAs ` rCs whenever there is an
isomorphism B – A ‘ C.

If C has a Z{2Z-action (not necessarily strong) then both G0pCq and K0pCq are modules over
Zπ “ Zrπs{pπ2 ´ 1q with rΠM s “ πrM s and if moreover C is graded then they are Zπrq, q´1s-
modules where q acts by shifting the grading up by 1. This story generalizes in the obvious way to
the case of multigraded categories.

If K0pCq is a ﬁnite rank supermodule we take its q-adic completion K c

0pCq, which is the free su-
permodule over the ring ZπJqKrq´1s of the same rank. Here ZπJqK denotes the ring of formal power
series in q with coefﬁcients in Zπ. The same applies to G0pCq. In our conventions, the Grothendieck
group of a bigraded category is a supermodule over the ring Zπrq, q´1, λ, λ´1s and we take the com-
0 or
pletion with respect to the variable q. We write rM sc for the classe of equivalence of M in Gc
0.
K c
From the remarks in the beginning of this section it is clear that K c

0pMq is one-dimensional and
generated by the class of the unique projective indecomposable Ωk. What is less clear is that Gc
0pMq
is generated by the class of the unique simple object Sk, since objects of M do not have ﬁnite length
in general.
Proposition 5.8. The (completed) Grothendieck group Gc
by the class of Sk.
Proof. Let M be an Ωk-supermodule in Mk. Since M is bounded from below, we can suppose
without losing generality that M has minimal bidegree p0, 0q. For i ě 0, let Mi denote the submodule
of M given by

0pMkq is one-dimensional and generated

Mi :“ tx P M | degqpxq ` k degλpxq ě iu.
By inspection we see that we have Mi`1 Ă Mi, which yields a ﬁltration

¨ ¨ ¨ Ă Mi`1 Ă Mi Ă ¨ ¨ ¨ Ă M0 “ M.

Since M is locally ﬁnite-dimensional, Mi{Mi`1 decomposes as a ﬁnite direct sum of ﬁnite dimen-
sional supermodules, each concentrated in a single bidegree. Since Ωk is a Z ˆ Z-graded local ring
with zeroth part isomorphic to Q, Mi{Mi`1 it is a direct sum of simple supermodules and the claim
follows.

Regarding the behavior of tensoring with Qrξs we have the following.

quence of the deﬁnition of the (enriched) Hom spaces in a bigraded category.
(cid:3)

5.4. Verma 2-representations. As explained in Subsections 1.1.3 and 5.1 above, the functors pF, Eq
are adjoint (up to grading shifts) but not biajoint. In order to accommodate our construction in the
concept of strong 2-representation and Q-strong 2-representations (in the sense of Rouquier [34] and
Cautis-Lauda [9] respectively) we adjust their deﬁnitions into the deﬁnition of a Verma 2-represen-
tation of sl2. Since we need the notion of short exact sequences of 1-morphisms, we require that a
Verma 2-representation has full subcategories of abelian categories as Hom-spaces between objects 2.

Deﬁnition 5.12. Fix a complex number c and let Λc “ pc ´ 1q ` 2Z. A Verma 2-representation of
sl2 consists of a bigraded, additive k-linear idempotent complete, 2-category R admitting a parity 2-
functor Π : R Ñ R, with Hom-space between objects being full subcategories of abelian categories
and where:

‚ The objects of R are indexed by weights µ P Λc.
‚ There are identity 1-morphisms 1µ for each µ, as well as 1-morphisms F1µ : µ Ñ µ ´ 2 in
1µ : µ Ñ µ. We also assume that F1µ has a right adjoint

R, and 1-morphisms Q1µ, K1µ, K´1
and deﬁne the 1-morphism E1µ : µ ´ 2 Ñ µ as a grading shift of a right adjoint of F ,

1µE “ pF1µqRxµ ` 2 ´ pc ´ 1q, ´1y.

On this data we impose the following conditions:
(1) The identity 1-morphism 1µ`2r of the object µ ` 2r is isomorphic to the zero 1-morphism for

r ą 0.

(2) The enriched HOMRp1l, 1lq are bounded from below.
(3) We have the following isomorphisms in R:

K1µ – 1µxµ ´ pc ´ 1q, 1y,

KE1µ – EK1µx2, 0y,

KF1µ – FK1µx´2, 0y,

and an exact sequence

0 ÝÝÑ FE1µ ÝÝÑ EF1µ ÝÝÑ QK1µ ‘ ΠQK´1

1µ ÝÝÑ 0.

Moreover, we require that Q commutes up to isomorphism with all 1-morphisms.

(4) The F’s and the E’s carry an action of the enlarged nilHecke algebra.

2 Notice that we do not necessarily demand that the subcategory is closed under taking extensions from short exact

sequences.

Categoriﬁcation of Verma modules

29

A Verma sub-2-representation of R is a Verma 2-representation R1 together with a fully-faithful 2-
functor R1 Ñ R. Throughout the rest of this paper we will use the terminology 2-representation and
for the Verma 2-representation and to refer to the 2-representations in [34] and [9] as 2-representation
in the sense of Rouquier and Cautis-Lauda.

Form the 2-category M whose objects are the categories Mk, the 1-morphisms are direct sums
of shifts of functors from tEk, Fk, Qk, Idku and the 2-morphisms are (grading preserving) natural
transformations of functors. In this case we rephrase Theorem 5.10 and say that the 2-category M is
a 2-representation of sl2 that categoriﬁes the Verma module M pλq´1q. As a matter of fact, SBimλ is
also a 2-representation which categoriﬁes the Verma module M pλq´1q and these two representations
are equivalent.

6. CATEGORIFICATION OF THE VERMA MODULES WITH INTEGRAL HIGHEST WEIGHT

In this section we categorify the evaluation map evn : M pλq´1q Ñ M pnq for n P Z.

6.1. Categoriﬁcation of M p´1q. Forgetting the λ-gradings of the superrings Ωk and Ωk,k`1 from
Subsection 3.1 results in single graded superrings that we denote Ωkp´1q and Ωk,k`1p´1q respec-
tively. We write xsy for the shift of the q-grading up by s units.

Deﬁne Mkp´1q “ Ωkp´1q -smodlf and Mk`1,kp´1q “ Ωk`1,kp´1q -smodlf with the functors

Fk : Mkp´1q Ñ Mk`1p´1q,
Ek : Mk`1p´1q Ñ Mkp´1q,
Qk : Mkp´1q Ñ Mkp´1q,
Kk : Mkp´1q Ñ Mkp´1q,

as in Section 5. Denote also Mp´1q “ ‘kě0Mkp´1q.

Since the q-grading in Ωkp´1q and Ωk`1,kp´1q is bounded from below and both superrings have
one-dimensional lowest-degree part, all the results in Section 5 can be transported to the singly-graded
case. Notice that either Ωkp´1q and Ωk`1,kp´1q are the product of a graded local ring with degree
0 part isomorphic to Q with a ﬁnite dimensional ring. The Grothendieck group Gc
0pMkp´1qq is still
generated by the simple object Sk.

Deﬁne the 2-category Mp´1q like M but with the Mkp´1qs as objects. Collapsing the λ-grading
deﬁnes a forgetful 2-functor M Ñ Mp´1q. Its is clear that Mp´1q together with the functors F, E,
Q and K, categoriﬁes the Verma module M p´1q. But we can do better, we deﬁne below a quotient of
Mp´1q where the action of F and E always results in ﬁnite-dimensional supermodules.

Let C be an additive category with a parity functor Π (this is not necessarily a supercategory). An
object M P C is said to be Π-symmetric if ΠM – M. These form a full subcategory of C. For objects
M, N of C write SpM, N q Ă HomCpM, N q for the subspace consisting of morphisms from M to N
that factor through a Π-symmetric object.

Deﬁnition 6.1. The category C consists of the same objects as C, while the morphism spaces between
any two objects M and N are given by

HomCpM, N q “ HomCpM, N q{SpM, N q.

Notice that this means all Π-symmetric objects in C are isomorphic to 0. Moreover, suppose C
possesses Grothendieck groups K0pCq or G0pCq, which are modules over Zπ. Then specializing π to
´1 in G0pCq or K0pCq gives isomorphic groups to respectively G0pCq and K0pCq, since the action of
the parity functor descends to multiplying by ´1 in the Grothendieck groups G0pCq and K0pCq. We

can thus also rephrase the Theorem 5.10 by saying that Gc

0pMq and K c

0pMq are isomorphic to the

Composing the forgetful 2-functor with the projection functor Mp´1q Ñ Mp´1q gives rise to an

exact 2-functor M Ñ Mp´1q that keeps the short exact sequence

in Mp´1q.

The following result comes almost for free from Theorem 5.10 together with the remarks above.

Theorem 6.3. The 2-functor U : M Ñ Mp´1q is exact and categoriﬁes the evaluation map ev´1, in
the sense that the Grothendieck groups K c
0pMp´1qq are isomorphic to the Verma
module M p´1q.

0pMp´1qq is analogous.

6.2. Categoriﬁcation of the shifted Verma module M pλqnq for n P Z. Having the 2-functor U at
hand, our strategy is to ﬁrst categorify the shifted Verma module M pλqnq for arbitrary n and then to
apply U to get a categoriﬁcation of the Vermas with integral highest weight.

Let ´n P N be ﬁxed and let G|n|´1,k and G|n|´1,k,k`1 the varieties of partial ﬂags in C8

The forgetful map G|n|´1,k Ñ Gk gives HpG|n|´1,kq the structure of a pHpGkq, HpG|n|´1,kqq-
bimodule and analogously for HpG|n|´1,k,k`1q, which becomes a pHpGk,k`1q, HpG|n|´1,k,k`1qq-
bimodule under the forgetful map G|n|´1,k,k`1 Ñ Gk,k`1. Tensoring on the left with HpG|n|´1,kq
(over HpGkq) and with HpG|n|´1,k,k`1q (over HpGk,k`1q) gives exact functors from HpGkq -smodlf
to HpG|n|´1,kq -smodlf and from HpGk,k`1q -smodlf to HpG|n|´1,k,k`1q -smodlf respectively.

6.3. Categoriﬁcation of the Verma module M pnq for n P Z. As before, we apply the map that
forgets the λ-grading on the rings Ωn
k,k`1 to obtain singly-graded rings Ωkpnq and Ωk,k`1pnq.
In this case we still have that the q-grading in Ωkpnq and Ωk`1,kpnq is bounded from below and
both superrings have one-dimensional lowest-degree part, and we can make use of all the results in
Section 5. Notice that again either Ωkpnq and Ωk`1,kpnq are the product of a graded local ring with
degree 0 part isomorphic to Q with a ﬁnite dimensional ring.

Denote by Mpnq the image of Mn under the forgetful functor and consider the category Mpnq
with the exact functor U : Mn Ñ Mpnq. We keep the notation Fk, Ek, Qk and Kk for U pFkq, U pEkq,

The categoriﬁcation of M pnq using Mpnq for n ă 0 is not minimal, in the sense that there is a
smaller category with the same properties we now describe. Notice that Ωkp´|n|q and Ωk,k`1p´|n|q

7. CATEGORIFICATION OF THE FINITE DIMENSIONAL IRREDUCIBLES FROM THE VERMA

CATEGORIFICATION

7.1. The ABC of the DG world. We start by recollecting some basic facts about DG algebras and
their (derived) categories of modules following closely the exposition in [3, Section 10].

A differential graded algebra (DG-algebra for short) pA, dq is a Z-graded associative unital algebra

A with 1 in degree zero, equipped with an additive endomorphism d of degree ´1 satisfying

d2 “ 0,

dpabq “ dpaqb ` p´1qdeg aadpbq,

dp1q “ 0.

A homomorphism between DG-algebras pA, dq and pA1, d1q is a homomorphism φ : A Ñ B of alge-
bras intertwining the differentials, φ ˝ d “ d ˝ φ.

A left DG-module M over A is a Z-graded left A-module with a differential dM : Mi Ñ Mi´1

such that, for all a P A and all m P M,

dM pamq “ dpaqm ` p´1qdegpaqadM pmq.

We have the analogous notion for right A-modules and bimodules. Denote by pA, dq -mod the abelian
category of (left) DG-modules over A. We say P P pA, dq -mod is projective if for every acyclic M in
pA, dq -mod the complex HomApP, M q is also acyclic. The homology HpM q of a DG-module over
A is the usual homology of the chain complex M. It is a graded module over the graded ring HpAq.
We say that A is formal if it is quasi-isomorphic to HpAq.

Two morphisms f, g : M Ñ N in pA, dq -mod are homotopic if there is a degree 1 map s : N Ñ M
such that f ´ g “ sdM ` dN s. The homotopy category KA, which is a triangulated category, is

36

Gr´egoire Naisse and Pedro Vaz

obtained from pA, dq -mod by modding out by null-homotopic maps. Inverting quasi-isomorphisms
results in the derived category DpAq, which is triangulated and idempotent complete.

The localization functor gives an isomorphism from the full subcategory of KA consisting of pro-

jective objects to the derived category DpAq. We say M is compact if the canonical map

‘iPI HomDpAqpM, Niq Ñ HomDpAqpM, ‘iPI Niq

is an isomorphism for every arbitrary direct sum of DG-modules. Note that A is compact projective.
Let DcpAq be the full subcategory of DpAq consisting of compact modules. It is also idempotent
complete.

For a homomorphism of DG-algebras φ : A Ñ B the derived induction functor is the derived

functor associated with the bimodule BBA,

IndB

A “ B bL

A p´q : DpAq Ñ DpBq

and the restriction functor is the forgetful functor via the map φ,

ResB

A : : DpBq Ñ DpAq.

The above functors are adjoint:

HomDpBqpIndB
If φ is a quasi-isomorphism then IndB

ApM q, N q – HomDpAqpM, ResB
A and ResB

ApN qq.

A are mutually inverse equivalences of categories.

We deﬁne the Grothendieck group of A as the Grothendieck group of the triangulated category
DcpAq. As Khovanov pointed out in [22], if A is formal and (graded) noetherian we can describe the
Grothendieck group of A via ﬁnitely-generated HpAq-modules.

Of course, all the above generalizes easily to the case where A has additional gradings and where
the differential is graded over Z{2Z. In this case we speak of graded (or bigraded) DG-algebras,
graded (or bigraded) homomorphisms and graded versions of all the categories above.

7.2. The differentials dn. We next introduce differentials on Ωk and Ωk,k`1 turning them into DG-
algebras for the parity degree. Recall that from Subsection 3.1 that the rings Ωk and Ωk,k`1 have
presentations

Ωk “ Qrx1,k, . . . , xk,k, s1, . . . , sks

and Ωk,k`1 “ Qrx1,k, . . . , xk,k, ξk`1, s1,k`1, . . . , sk`1,k`1s.

Deﬁnition 7.1. Deﬁne maps dk
and parity ´1 by

n : Ωk Ñ Ωk and dk,k`1

From now on we use dn to denote either dk

whenever the k or the k, k ` 1 are clear
from the context. The maps dn satisfy dn ˝ dn “ 0 and therefore Ωk and Ωk,k`1 become DG-algebras
with dn of bidegree x2n ` 2, ´2y which we denote pΩk, dnq and pΩk,k`1, dnq. These algebras are
bigraded and Differential Graded with respect to the Z{2Z-grading (a.k.a. the parity).

DG-rings pΩk, dnq and pΩk,k`1, dnq have a nice geometric interpretation.

Proposition 7.4. The DG-rings pΩk, dnq and pΩk,k`1, dnq are formal. (1) The DG-ring pΩk, dnq is
quasi-isomorphic to the cohomology of the Grassmannian variety HpGk;nq of k-planes in Cn. (2) The
DG-ring pΩk,k`1, dnq is quasi-isomorphic to the cohomology of the partial ﬂag variety HpGk,k`1;nq
of k, k ` 1-planes in Cn.

Proof. Let pdnpskqq denote the two-sided ideal of Qrxks generated by dnps1,kq, . . . , dnpsk,kq and let
pdnpσk`1qq denote the two-sided ideal of Qrxk, ξk`1s generated by dnpσ1,k`1q, . . . , dnpσk`1,k`1q. If
we equip the quotient rings

Qrxks{pdnpskqq

and Qrxk, ξk`1s{pdnpσk`1qq

with the zero differential, an easy exercise shows that the obvious surjections Ωk ։ Qrxks{pdnpskqq
and Ωk,k`1 ։ Qrxk, ξk`1s{pdnpσk`1qq, are quasi-isomorphisms.

The formula (8) together with the deﬁnition of the differential show that Yn´k`r,k P pdnpskqq for

all r ě 1 and thus give a presentation

Qrxks{pdnpskqq » Qrxk, Y pn´kqs{Ik,n
with Ik,n the ideal generated by the homogeneous terms in the equation

p1 ` x1,kt ` . . . ` xk,ktkqp1 ` Y1,kt ` . . . ` Ypn´kq,ktn´kq “ 1

which is a presentation for the cohomology ring HpGk;nq and thus proves part (1). The second claim
is proved in a same way.

˜si. After passing to the derived category we get a category isomorphic to Vpnq.

It is a DG pk, k ` sqn-bimodule isomorphic to

pΩk,k`1 bk`1 Ωk`1,k`2 bk`2 ¨ ¨ ¨ bk`n´1 Ωk`n´1,k`n, dnq.

Recall from Section 4.2 that The nilHecke algebra NHs acts on the ring Ωk,...,k`s as endomor-

phisms of pΩk`s, Ωkq-bimodules. We now show this action extends to the DG context.
Proposition 7.12. The nilHecke algebra NHs acts as endomorphisms of the DG pk, k ` sqn-bimodule
pΩk,...,k`s, dnq and of the DG pk ` s, kqn-bimodule pΩk`s,...,k, dnq.
Proof. It is sufﬁcient to verify that the action of the Bis from NHs commute with the differential
dn on pΩk,...,k`s, dnq since the action of xi, which comes to multiplying by ξi, obviously commutes
from the deﬁnition dnpξiq “ 0. The commutation with the action of Bi follows from the fact that
X ´ is a bimodule morphism with parity 0 and that the differential is a bimodule endomorphism.
, then X ´pdnpf qq “ 0 “ dnpX ´pf qq. Suppose now
Indeed, suppose f is a polynomial in xi,k and ξ
recursively that f P Ωk,k`s respects such a relation. From the bimodule structure, we get

which is enough to concludes the proof since we can express every si,k`j as combination of si,k`s
and ξk`i.

Now consider the quotient category PMpnq{PMp´n´2q. From all the above, it’s straightforward
that the Grothendieck group K c

module V pnq. It is clear that although endowed with a nilHecke action, PMpnq{PMp´n ´ 2q is not
a strong categoriﬁcation of V pnq.

All the above can be described easily in terms of the 2-representations (M, Mpnq, etc) from the

8. VERMA CATEGORIFICATION AND A GRAPHICAL CALCULUS

In Section 4.2 we constructed an extended version of the nilHecke algebra which acts on Ωk,k`n.
In this section we study this algebra more closely and give it a diagrammatic version, in the same
spirit as the KLR algebras [23, 27, 34] as isotopy classes of diagrams modulo relations.

8.1. The superalgebra An. Consider the collection of diagrams on the plane connecting n points
on the horizontal axis R ˆ t0u to n points on the horizontal line R ˆ t1u with no critical point when
projected onto the y-axis, such that the strands can never turn around. We allow the strands to intersect
each other without triple intersection points. We decorate the strands with (black) dots and white dots,
equipping the diagram with a height function such that we cannot have two white dots on the same
height. Moreover, the regions are labeled by integers such that each time we cross a strand from left
to right the label increase by 1 :

k ` 1

k

k ` 2

k ` 1

From this rule, it is sufﬁcient to write a label for the left most region of a diagram. Furthermore, these
diagrams are taken up to isotopy which does not create any critical point and preserves the relative
height of the white dots as well as the labelling of the regions. An example of such diagram is:

k

Fix a ﬁeld k and denote by An the k-algebra obtained by the linear combinations of these diagrams
together with multiplication given by gluing diagrams on top of each other whenever the labels of the
regions agree and zero otherwise. In our conventions ab means stacking the diagram for a atop the
one for b, whenever they are composable. Our diagrams are subjected to the following local relations:

Proof. Using the relations (28)-(31) we can push all dots and white dots to the bottom of the diagrams.
By the relations (26), we can have a maximum of one white dot per strand on the bottom of each
diagram and by relations (27) we get the decomposition in Bw as in the nilHecke algebra (see [23,
Section 2.3] for example).

Proof. The commutation relations produced by isotopies are immediate from Bi being zero on xj
and ωj for j R ti, i ` 1u together with the rule (32). The relation B2

The Reidemeister III relation (27) is proved in a same way, we leave the details for the reader. The
nilHecke relations (28) and (29) are easy computations. Indeed we have

Finally, computing

The action of NHn on Qrxns with xi acting by multiplication and Bi by divided difference operators

induces an action of NHn on Qrxns bŹ‚pωnq. This action coincides with the one given by restricting

the Anp0q-action since

Remark 8.3. The rule (32) is not equivalent to the Leibniz rule on the exterior part.

8.3. The action of Anpk ` mq on Ωm
superring Ωm,m`n can be written as

k,k`n. We have already observed in Subsection 6.2 that the

Ωm,m`n » Ωm,m`1 bm`1 . . . bm`n´1 Ωm`n´1,m`n.

We therefore get an action of Anpmq on Ωm,m`n given by

m ` i

ÞÑ ξi`1,

m ` i

ÞÑ si`1,i`1,

m ` i

ÞÑ`X ´ : Ωi,i`1 b Ωi`1,i`2 Ñ Ωi,i`1 b Ωi`1,i`2˘ .

Categoriﬁcation of Verma modules

This action agrees with the one deﬁned in Subsection 8.2 and this can be generalized to get an action
of Anpk ` mq on Ωm

k,k`n.

8.4. Categoriﬁcation. We deﬁne

Apmq “àně0

Anpmq.

The usual inclusion Anpmq ãÑ An`1pmq that adds a strand at the right of a diagram from Anpmq
gives rise to induction and restriction functors F and E on Apmq -smodlf that satisfy the sl2-relations.
Recall that Apmq -smodlf is the category of locally ﬁnite-dimensional left Anpmq-supermodules. Our
results in Sections 4, 5 and 6 imply that Anpmq -smodlf categoriﬁes the pc ´ 1 ` m ´ 2nqth-weight
space of M pλqm´1q and that the sl2 2-representation Apmq -smodlf categoriﬁes the Verma module
Mpλqm´1q. The categoriﬁcation of the Verma modules with integral highest weight using special-
izations of the superalgebras Anpmq follows as a consequence of our results in Section 6.

8.5. Cyclotomic quotients. We can turn AnpN ` 1q into a DG-algebra, equipping it with a differen-
tial of degree p0, ´2q deﬁned by

dN pxiq “ 0,

dN pBiq “ 0,

dN pωiq “ hN ´i`1pxiq,

together with the parity graded Leibniz rule (as before, the parity is the cohomological degree of dn).
We stress that we take the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial on only the ﬁrst i variables,
and therefore it commutes with Bj for all j ‰ i and respects (31) for Bi (recall that Yi,k “ hipξkq).
Proposition 8.4. The DG-algebra pAnpN ` 1q, dN q is quasi-isomorphic to the cyclotomic quotient
of the nilHecke algebra NHN

n “ NHn {pxN

1 q,

pAnpN ` 1q, dN q – NHN
n .

Proof. It sufﬁces to notice that dN pω1q “ hN px1q “ xN
1 (see for example [15, Proposition 2.8]).
xN

1 since dN pωiq lies in the ideal generated by
