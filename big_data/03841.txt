The eﬀects of oxygen vacancies at the interface of between FeSe thin ﬁlms and SrTiO3(001) on
the electronic bands of FeSe are investigated by ﬁrst-principles supercell calculations. Unfolded
(k-projected) bands show that oxygen vacancies not only provide electron doping to the interface
FeSe layer, but also signiﬁcantly renormalize the width of the Fe-3d band near the Fermi level by
a factor of about 0.6 for the checkerboard antiferromagnetic state. However, for the top layer of
an FeSe bilayer, the eﬀects on the electronic properties are limited. The k-projected bands for
FeSe on SrTiO3(001) with oxygen vacancies in the checkerboard antiferromagnetic state are in good
agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the discovery of high Tc superconductivity
in FeSe monolayers grown on SrTiO3(001) (STO) has
inspired intense interest in the FeSe/STO interface and
FeSe thin ﬁlms.1–6 By means of in situ scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy (STM) Wang et al. observed a supercon-
ducting gap of about 20 meV for epitaxially grown FeSe
monolayers after proper annealing, suggesting that the
superconducting Tc in the grown FeSe monolayers may
be as high as 77 K.1 Subsequent transport measurements
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
experiments also observed high-Tc superconductivity in
this system.7–13 One puzzling feature of this observation
is that the Fermi surface of the superconducting mono-
layer FeSe/SrTiO3 is characterized by an electron-like
pocket centered around the M points, while no pocket
appears near the Γ point.10–13 This challenges the Fermi
surface nesting scenario that relies on nesting between M
and Γ-point electronic states.14,15

Although the mechanism of the high Tc supercon-
ductivity in the grown FeSe monolayer is under debate,
there is consensus that the substrate plays an important
role. First of all, it induces strain on the FeSe ﬁlms
thereby modifying their electronic properties.16 In addi-
tion, it has been argued that the ferroelectric phonons in
the substrate coupling to electrons in FeSe may enhance
the superconductivity.17 Most importantly, the electronic
properties of the grown FeSe monolayers are strongly de-
pendent on annealing, i.e., the semiconducting as-grown
FeSe monolayer becomes metallic upon proper anneal-
ing and then superconducting with further annealing.18
However, FeSe multilayers show distinct diﬀerences in
that they remain non-superconducting after the anneal-
ing. This suggests that oxygen vacancies formed during
annealing play an important role in the evolution of the
electronic properties.

There have been a number of ﬁrst-principles studies
of both free-standing and supported FeSe thin ﬁlms,19–28
investigating the eﬀect of the SrTiO3 substrate20–24, sur-
face adatoms,24,25 Se-vacancies,26 electron doping,27,28
and oxygen vacancies (O-vac).21–24 It is found that there

is no strong chemical bonding between the FeSe mono-
layer and perfect SrTiO3(001), although the Se atoms in
the FeSe monolayer do prefer the top sites of the cation
atoms of the substrate.20 The binding is enhanced by
interface oxygen vacancies, which dope electrons to the
FeSe monolayer, which consequently modify the Fermi
surface of the overlayer.21–23 The eﬀect of oxygen va-
cancies on the bands of the nonmagnetic state has been
investigated within the virtual crystal approximation,
showing that the hole pockets around Γ are not fully
removed.24 However, thus far, the understanding of the
eﬀects of O vacancy at the interface between FeSe thin
ﬁlms and the SrTiO3(001) substrate remains incomplete,
including issues related to the eﬀect of oxygen vacancies
on the electronic structures of FeSe layers both at the
interface and farther away.

In this study, we investigate the eﬀects of interface
O-vac on the electronic bands of FeSe monolayers and
bilayers supported on SrTiO3(001) by carrying out ﬁrst-
principles supercell calculations. Unfolded bands derived
from the k-projection method for the checkerboard an-
tiferromagnetic (AFM) states show that the O-vac pro-
vides electron doping to the interface FeSe layer, induces
a band splitting at the M point, and lowers the Fe-3dz2
states at the Γ point, thus signiﬁcantly renormalizing the
width of the Fe-3d band near the Fermi level. However,
the eﬀects of the O-vacancy on the electronic properties
of the top layer of bilayer FeSe are limited.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

As shown in Fig. 1, the substrate SrTiO3(001) (with
a lattice constant of 3.905 ˚A) was modeled by a TiO2-
terminated slab consists of ﬁve TiO2 layers and four SrO
layers, built based on the relaxed structure of the an-
tiferrodistortive SrTiO3 bulk. To avoid dipole interac-
tions between slabs a single layer of FeSe is symmetri-
cally placed on each side of SrTiO3(001), with Se atoms
directly sitting on surface Ti atoms since this stacking
was previously found to be more favorable compared

ation only the FeSe and the top TiO2 and SrO layers

the residual force on each atom while other atoms were
held ﬁxed.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We consider three diﬀerent magnetic orders in the FeSe
ﬁlms,
including nonmagnetic (NM), checkerboard an-
tiferromangetic (CB-AFM), and collinear antiferromag-
netic (CL-AFM) states. (The unstable high energy fer-
romagnetic state is not considered.) Table 1 summa-
rizes the structural properties of the interfaces of an FeSe
monolayer with the perfect SrTiO3(001) substrate and
with STO-vac. The interlayer distance dFeSe−STO re-
mains almost unchanged for the diﬀerent magnetic states.
The vertical distance between Ti and Se atoms dT i−Se
(which diﬀers by ∼0.08 ˚A because the surface oxygen are
above the Ti atoms) is about 2.98 ˚A for the CB-AFM
state without the interface O-vacancy, slightly smaller
than 3.06 ˚A reported by previous studies20,27 as a re-
sult of the vdW correction. dTi−Se is about 3.0 ˚A for
the CL-AFM state, consistent with Shanavas and Singh’s
calculation.24 The Fe-Se bond lengths for the NM state
are slightly shorter than those for the magnetic states.
Although the two Se atoms are inequivalent because of
the presence of the substrate, there is negligible diﬀerence
in dFe−Se for the two Se layers, implying that symmetry
breaking in the supported FeSe monolayer due to the
substrate may be weak.

Introduction of an O vacancy aﬀects dFeSe−STO sig-
niﬁcantly. Speciﬁcally, dFeSe−STO is reduced by about
10%, in agreement with a previous study.23 However, the
eﬀect on the internal structure of the FeSe overlayer is
negligible: dFe−Se remains almost unchanged and the Fe
atoms are still nearly co-planar. The induced variations
of magnetic moments are in the range of 0.04-0.07 µB.

We now look at the electronic bands of the supported
FeSe thin ﬁlms. Supercells were used in the calculations,
leading to band folding. To discern the eﬀects of the
interface O-vacancy on the electronic bands of the FeSe
overlayer, the supercell wave functions in FeSe (spatial

separated from its periodic images by ∼20 ˚A vacuum
regions. An oxygen vacancy is modeled by removing
one surface oxygen atom in a 2×2 supercell (STO-vac;
see Fig. 1(b)). Our calculations were performed us-
ing the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.29,30 The
exchange correlation functional is approximated by the
generalized gradient approximation as parametrized by
Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof,31 and the pseudopoten-
tials were constructed by the projector augmented wave
method.32,33 van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces be-
tween the adsorbate and the substrate were included
using the vdW-DF method developed by Klimeˇs and
Michaelides.34 A 8×8 Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh was used
to sample the surface BZ and a plane-wave energy cut

window W shown in Fig. 1) were projected onto the
corresponding k of the (1×1) FeSe cell using the layer
k-projection technique.35,36 In this way, the O-vacancy
serves as a perturbation over the bands of (1×1) FeSe, of
which the eﬀects on the band structure can be seen from
the weights.

Figure 2 shows k-projected bands for supported FeSe
in diﬀerent magnetic states with and without the inter-
face O-vacancy. Bands of the isolated FeSe monolayers
with the same structure as in the supported case (i.e.,
with the substrate removed) are overlaid for comparison.
From Figs. 2(a)-(c), one can see that without the inter-
face oxygen vacancy, the bands of the supported FeSe are
similar to those of the free-standing FeSe monolayer. For
the NM state, there are two hole bands near Γ and two
electron bands around M crossing the Fermi level (EF ).
For the CB-AFM state there is a hole band with a top
that is slightly higher than EF at Γ and a electron band
around M, which is spin-degenerate. The bands at Γ near
the EF due to Fe-3d orbitals will be located below EF
if a Hubbard-U correction is added.27 For the CL-AFM
state, there are hole bands crossing EF near both Γ and
M, in agreement with a previous study.20 Figs. 2(a)-(c)
also indicate that the perfect substrate has minor eﬀects
on the bands of FeSe near the Fermi level and a negligible
shift of the Fermi level. For the NM state, the FeSe bands
remain almost unaﬀected, except for a small shift of the

states about Γ at near −0.2 eV and the states about M
near −0.4 eV. For the CB-AFM state bands at Γ near
−0.3 eV are shifted upward by about 0.1 eV.

Figures 2(d)-(f) indicate that there is a signiﬁcant shift
of the Fermi level as a result of electron doping provided
by the O-vacancy. Accordingly, the electron pockets near
Γ become smaller and the hole pocket about M becomes
larger for the NM state. However, the main proﬁle of
FeSe bands is basically maintained, except for the bands
about Γ at about −0.3 eV composed of Fe-3dxz and -
z, which are shifted downward to −0.45 eV. For the

interface and (d)-(f) top FeSe layer in the NM, CB-AFM, and CL-AFM states, respectively.

CB-AFM state the O-vacancy not only shifts EF but
also lowers the band at Γ. As a result, the hole pocket
at Γ disappears and the band-width is renormalized by a
factor of about 0.6. Moreover, it induces a band splitting
of about 40 meV at the M point, which is larger than
the 20-30 meV splittings due to spin-orbit.37 For the CL-
AFM state the pockets near Γ and near M are hole-like.
The empty states of FeSe are strongly perturbed by the
hybridization with the substrate.

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the electronic bands for
CB-AFM conﬁguration with and without the O-vacancy
is related to the structural diﬀerences. Table I shows
that the structure of FeSe thin ﬁlms remains almost unaf-
fected, but the interlayer distance is considerably reduced
in the presence of the O-vacancy, which may strengthen
the interaction between the overlayer and the substrate,
including inducing more charge transfer between them.
To study the eﬀect of the interlayer separation, we per-
formed calculations for perfect FeSe/SrTiO3(001) with
the interlayer distance reduced by 0.3 ˚A. Figure 3 in-
dicates that the FeSe bands are basically not aﬀected.
Therefore, the dramatic changes in the band structures
of FeSe may be caused by the O-vacancy, which dopes
electrons to the FeSe overlayer and also pins the Fermi
level of the FeSe to the substrate band gap. Indeed, pre-
vious calculations have demonstrated that bands at M
and Γ for the freestanding CB-AFM FeSe are sensitive
to charge doping.27

The bands for an FeSe bilayer on SrTiO3(001) with an
oxygen vacancy are shown in Fig. 4. One important fea-

ture that can be seen from Fig. 4 is that the k-projected
bands for the interface layer are similar to those for mono-
layer FeSe/STO-vac, while the bands for the top layer
(Figs. 4(d)-(f)) resemble those for the perfect FeSe/STO.
In particular, a comparison of Figs. 4(b) and (e) indi-
cates that for the CB-AFM state, the band splitting at
M point is almost negligible for the top layer and a pocket
appears at Γ. For the CL-AFM state, the strong band
hybridization between empty states of the interface FeSe
layer and the substrate along M-Γ (Fig. 4(c)) is not seen
for the top layer. This indicates that the O-vacancy has
little eﬀect on the top layer, which stems from the in-
terface FeSe layer eﬀectively screening charges created
by the interface O-vacancy. This is consistent with pre-
vious calculations that ﬁnd that charge induced by the
O-vacancy are mainly distributed at the interface.22

We now compare our calculations with ARPES exper-
iments. It was observed that the Fermi surface of mono-
layer FeSe/SrTiO3 consists of electron-like pockets at M
with a band bottom 60 meV below the Fermi level.10–13
Further analysis reveals that there are two nearly degen-
erate electron bands.17 Moreover, there is one hole-like
band about 40 meV below the bottom of the electron-
like band. At Γ there is one hole-like band with a
top located 80 meV below EF .
In the case of bilayer
FeSe/SrTiO3 there are several hole-like bands right be-
low EF at Γ. There are four small pockets forming a
cross-shaped Fermi surface centered around M. Detailed
band structure reveals that they result from the cross-
ing of a hole-like band and a electron-like band. At the

ested bands about Γ and M are also in agreement with
ARPES results (Fig. 3 in Ref. 13) without any rescaling.
The shape of the top of the hole-band at Γ as well as
M is sensitive to lattice constant, which becomes round
for smaller in-plane lattice constants. The replica bands
seen by the ARPES experiments17 does not appear in our
calculations, these have been attributed to the coupling
of FeSe bands to the substrate ferroelectric phonons.

For bilayer FeSe/SrTiO3(001), the Fermi level of the
top FeSe layer stays nearly unchanged in the presence of
the O-vacancy. Figure 5(c) shows that there is only one
hole-like band at Γ near EF , diﬀering from the ARPES
measurements which observe multiple hole bands. From
Fig. 5(d) one can see a splitting of about 180 meV be-
tween the two hole-like bands at the M point, much larger
than that is seen by the experiments. In addition, the
splitting tends to increase as the k moves away from M,
in contrast to the experimental observations. We ﬁnd
that shifting the bands of the interface FeSe layer to
account for a lower electron doping and then superim-
posing them onto those for the top FeSe layer does not
improve the agreement. Given that the 80 meV splitting
of the two hole bands at M are common for FeSe thin
ﬁlms thicker than monolayer12, the discrepancy between
our calculations and ARPES measurements may be at-
tributed to nematicity and/or spin-orbit37 in FeSe, which
is not taken into account in our calculations.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, the eﬀects of oxygen vacancies at the in-
terface of between FeSe thin ﬁlms and SrTiO3(001) are
investigated by carrying out ﬁrst-principles supercell cal-
culations. The interface oxygen vacancy not only pro-
vides electron doping to the interface FeSe layer, but also
signiﬁcantly renormalizes the width of the Fe-3d band
near the Fermi level for the checkerboard AFM state.
However, due to the screening of the interface FeSe layer,
the eﬀects of the O-vacancy on the electronic properties
of the top FeSe layer in bilayer FeSe are limited, e.g.,
the electronic bands for the top FeSe layer are similar
to the perfect monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3(001). The calcu-
lated bands around Γ and M for the checkerboard-AFM
monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3(001) in the presence of oxygen
vacancies are consistent with ARPES results. However,
for the bilayer case the agreement is not good, which
may require further investigations taking nematicity and
additional magnetic conﬁgurations into account.

for FeSe (a), (b) monolayer and (c), (d) bilayer on STO-vac.

M point there is another hole-like band below the Fermi
level with a top at 60 meV below EF which has a energy
separation of about 80 meV from the higher hole band.
The separation/splitting reduces dramatically as the k
point goes further away from M (Fig. S2 in Ref. 12).

Comparison of the bands of band in the presence of
an O-vacancy for the three magnetic conﬁgurations sug-
gest that neither the NM state nor the CL-AFM state is
likely seen by the ARPES experiments since they give rise
to large pockets around Γ, inconsistent with the experi-
mental observations. In contrast, for the CB-AFM state
(Fig. 2(e)) there is no pocket near Γ and only electron
pockets centered about M, consistent with the ARPES
results. Since in the present study a 2×2 supercell with
one O-vacancy was used to model the substrate, this gives
rise to a much higher doping level than experiment and
results in a larger shift of the Fermi level. Based on these
considerations, we rigidly shift down the Fermi level such
that it corresponds to a lower doping level. Figs. 5(a) and
(b) show bands about Γ and M, respectively. One can
see that there are two nearly degenerate electron bands
about M, where the band splitting between the electron
band and the hole band is ∼40 meV, consistent with the
ARPES experiments. In addition, the width of the inter-
