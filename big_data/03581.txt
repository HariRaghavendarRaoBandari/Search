New propagation regimes for light arise from the ability to tune the dielectric permittivity to
extremely low values. Here we demonstrate a universal approach based on the low linear permittivity
values attained in the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) regime for enhancing the nonlinear refractive index,
which enables remarkable light-induced changes of the material properties. Experiments performed
on Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin ﬁlms show a six-fold increase of the Kerr nonlinear refractive index
(n2) at the ENZ wavelength, located in the 1300 nm region. This in turn leads to light-induced
refractive index changes of the order of unity, thus representing a new paradigm for nonlinear optics.

The nonlinear optical response of matter to light is, by
its very nature, a perturbative and hence typically weak
eﬀect. Applications, e.g.
for nonlinear optical switches
or quantum optics, are therefore largely underpinned by
the continuous endeavour to attain stronger and more ef-
ﬁcient light-matter interactions.
Nonlinear mechanisms can typically be classiﬁed as res-
onant or non-resonant, depending on the frequency of
light with respect to the characteristic electronic reso-
nances of the material. Non resonant nonlinearities, like
those present in transparent crystals or amorphous ma-
terials (e.g.
fused silica glass), are generally weak and
require high light intensities and/or very long samples to
take advantage of an extended light matter interaction.
Conversely, resonant nonlinearities can be several orders
of magnitude stronger, but this comes at the price of in-
troducing detrimental losses. A typical example is that
of metals, which both reﬂect and absorb light strongly
[1–3]. An alternative approach to enhance the nonlin-
ear response of a material consists of creating artiﬁcial
electromagnetic resonances, for example by stacking ma-
terials of diﬀerent refractive index or using other types
of composite materials [4–11]. Creating resonant metal-
dielectric stacks and composites yields a very strong non-
linear enhancement [12–14], but inevitably exacerbates
the detrimental role of linear and nonlinear losses.
Here we propose a diﬀerent approach to enhance the
eﬀective nonlinearity without resorting to optical reso-
nances. Our approach relies on enhancing the nonlinear
eﬀect, measured in terms of the nonlinear Kerr index n2,
rather than on a direct enhancement of the intrinsic χ(3)
nonlinear susceptibility. As we show below, this enhance-
ment arises due to the fact that the nonlinear refractive
index is a function of both the nonlinear susceptibility
and the linear refractive index. Recent progress in mate-
rial design and fabrication has provided access to the full
range of linear optical properties bounded by dielectric
and metallic regimes. Of particular relevance for this

work are materials which exhibit a real part of the di-
electric permittivity that is zero, or close to zero, such as
transparent conducting oxides where their permittivity
cross over is typically located in the near infrared spec-
tral region.
The linear properties of these “epsilon-near-zero” (ENZ)
materials have been investigated [15–29] for applications
ranging from controlling the radiation pattern of electro-
magnetic sources to novel waveguiding regimes. Simi-
larly, the nonlinear properties have also been shown to
be largely eﬀected by the ENZ condition [30–36]. How-
ever, experimental evidence reported so far is limited to
phase matching-free conditions in four-wave-mixing [37],
enhanced third and second harmonic generation [38, 39],
and ultrafast optical switching [40].

In order to illustrate how the nonlinear Kerr index
may be enhanced as a result of the ENZ linear proper-
ties, we employed a 900 nm thick ﬁlm of oxygen-deprived
aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) [40, 41]. The AZO
900-nm thick thin ﬁlm was deposited by pulsed laser
deposition [42, 43] (PVD Products Inc.) using a KrF
excimer laser (Lambda Physik GmbH) operating at a
wavelength of 248 nm for source material ablation (see
Ref. [41] for more details).

The linear response i.e. real and imaginary parts of
ε, εr and εi, respectively, were measured by a standard
reﬂection/transmission measurement using a tunable-
wavelength, 100 fs, 100 Hz repetition rate, weak probe
beam. The linear permittivity, shown in Fig. 1 is then
evaluated from the reﬂection/transmission measurements
by means of an inverse transfer matrix approach. The
condition εr = 0 (ENZ wavelength) is at ∼1300 nm.
For many applications and measurements, the nonlinear
Kerr index n2 is used instead of the third-order nonlinear
χ(3) tensor. For the case of a non-degenerate pump-probe
scenario with a weak probe and an intense pump beam,

coeﬃcients as a function of wavelength. Indeed, under
the assumption of a frequency independent nonlinearity
(χ(3)) and that χ(3)
, the wavelength dependence
of n2r is essentially determined by the term (nr + ni)/D.
Likewise, the nonlinear absorption coeﬃcient is deter-
mined by (nr − ni)/D. Both these quantities are plot-
ted in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively, starting from the
measured frequency-dependent linear refractive index of
our sample. The presence of an ENZ wavelength (in-
dicated by the vertical dashed line) signiﬁcantly modi-
ﬁes the behaviour of the materials: a peak is observed
in the (nr + ni)/D term, indicating an enhancement of
n2r whilst the nonlinear absorption shows a more com-
plex behaviour and changes sign. The transition from
positive to negative (i.e. saturable) nonlinear absorption
occurs at the ENZ wavelength, such that the maximum
nonlinear phase shift can be attained with zero nonlinear
losses. This is a unique feature of ENZ materials and
underlines the crucial role played by the material’s linear
dispersion and the eﬀects of the ENZ condition on the
nonlinear optical response.
We note that in order to observe the described enhance-
ment one needs to achieve the ENZ condition for the real
part of the linear dielectric permittivity whilst maintain-
ing a relatively low imaginary part, as this in turn guar-
antees a low real part of the refractive index. The AZO
ﬁlm employed here displays all of the required properties
for both the linear and nonlinear susceptibility to exper-
imentally demonstrate the predicted nonlinear enhance-
ment. Remarkably, this also comes with an extremely
high damage threshold – no damage was observed up to
2 TW/cm2 (at 785 nm, 100 Hz repetition rate), to be
compared to the few GW/cm2 typical of metallic struc-
tures.
We characterised the nonlinear response of the AZO ﬁlm
with a pump and probe system by measuring the pump-
induced change in reﬂectivity and transmissivity for dif-
ferent pump intensities, see Figs. 3(a) and (b). The pump

dard deviations, respectively. The large error bars for the real

very low values of transmissivity measured, in turn resulting
in a high relative error.

We note that although it is generally desirable to
minimise the absorption losses, the imaginary part of
the material’s linear response also plays a crucial role
in determining the eﬀective nonlinear response. This
can be appreciated by separating the complex nonlinear
Kerr index into its real and imaginary parts [45]:

sults for both the real part, n2r, and nonlinear absorption

show a good qualitative agreement with the theoretical
curves in Fig. 2. Most importantly, as seen in Fig. 5(a),
a clear six-fold enhancement of n2,r is observed around
the ENZ wavelength.
Remarkably, for the laser pulse intensities used in our
experiments the measured nonlinear refractive index n2r
gives a change of refractive index in the medium (δnr =

larised) has a ﬁxed wavelength λpump = 785 nm and is at
normal incidence with respect to the sample. The probe
pulse (100 fs, 100 Hz repetition rate, vertically polarised)
from an Optical Parametric Ampliﬁer (OPA) and tunable
from 1150 to 1550 nm is incident at a small (< 10◦) an-
gle. The intensity of the probe beam is kept low (below
the GW/cm2 level) to avoid any nonlinearity from the
probe itself (no change in the probe transmissivity and
reﬂectivity was observed at this intensity). The probe
beam waist (w0,probe = 45 µm) is smaller than the pump
beam waist (w0,pump = 125 µm), in order to obtain a uni-
form pump intensity across the probe beam. For all the
measurements the pump beam size was constant and the
intensity was changed only increasing the energy. The
pump-probe delay was then optimised to maximise the
nonlinear eﬀect.
For each probe wavelength we measure the pump-induced
change in reﬂection and transmission of the probe beam
and then use these values to retrieve the permittivity in
the pumped case (εnl) by applying an inverse transfer
matrix approach. Whenever the dependence of εnl from
Ip is linear, we may determine the third order nonlinear-
ity from the relation [46]:

where ωp and Ip are the pump frequency and intensity,
respectively, and the derivative can be evaluated as the
slope of the linear ﬁt of εnl(Ip).
In Fig. 4(a) we show
an example of εnl(Ip) for a speciﬁc probe wavelength
(λprobe = 1258 nm) with the corresponding linear ﬁt,
while Fig. 4(b) reports the resulting real and imaginary
parts of the material χ(3) as a function of the probe wave-
length.
From the χ(3) values it is possible to extract the nonlinear
Kerr index by exploiting the formulas in Eqs. 2. The re-

For example, at 1390 nm we measured a change of refrac-
tive index as high as δnr = 0.4 to be compared with the
linear index nr = 0.09, recorded for the highest intensity
Ip = 1300 GW/cm2 without observing any optical dam-
age, see Fig. 5(c). This large modulation places the ENZ
nonlinearity in AZO at the limit of the non-perturbative
regime, i.e.
in a regime where the approximation of ex-
panding the material polarisation in a power series breaks
down [44].
We remark that these results, have been achieved thanks
to the speciﬁc properties of the AZO ﬁlms, featured by
both the ENZ condition combined with a relatively low
imaginary part of the permittivity, εi. The latter con-
dition ensures that the linear refractive index is signiﬁ-
cantly close to zero which helps to maximise the observed
enhancement of the nonlinear index. One should there-
fore expect comparable eﬀects in any other material that
exhibits similar optical properties.

In conclusion, ENZ materials allow one to tailor and
access novel linear propagation regimes. Here we have
shown the ability to exploit the ENZ regime for enhanc-
ing third-order nonlinear eﬀects. The interplay between
the real and imaginary parts of the linear refractive index
and χ(3) tensor leads to a peculiar wavelength-dependent
behaviour of the nonlinear refractive index. This allows,
for example, an enhancement of the real part of the non-
linear index, which in turn is associated with a nonlin-
ear phase shift in the probe beam. On the other hand,
novel and interesting behaviours are observed such as the
change in sign of the β2 coeﬃcient, eﬀectively eliminating
nonlinear absorption close to the ENZ wavelength. More-
over, the possibility to optically control the material’s re-
fractive index by amounts comparable to the linear val-
ues may allow one to eﬀectively tailor the impedance
of the material and match it to that of the surround-
ing medium. The ability to access light-induced refrac-
tive index change of the order of unity represents a new
paradigm for nonlinear optics.
