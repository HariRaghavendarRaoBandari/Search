DIVISION POLYNOMIALS AND INTERSECTION

OF PROJECTIVE TORSION POINTS

FEDOR BOGOMOLOV and HANG FU

ABSTRACT. Given two elliptic curves, each of which is associated with a quotient map that identiﬁes
opposite elements, we investigate the intersection of their corresponding projective torsion points.

1 Introduction

Throughout the article, let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, (E, O) an elliptic curve deﬁned over K, E[n]
the collection of n-th torsion points, E∗[n] the collection of torsion points of exact order n, E[∞] the
collection of all torsion points, and π ∈ K(E) an even morphism of degree 2.
Bogomolov and Tschinkel [1] observed that

Theorem 1. If π1(E1[2]) and π2(E2[2]) are different, then the intersection of π1(E1[∞]) and π2(E2[∞])
is ﬁnite.

Proof. Consider the product map π1 × π2 : E1 × E2 → P1 × P1, let ∆ be the diagonal curve. Suppose
that #π1(E1[2]) ∩ π2(E2[2]) = 0 (resp. 1, 2, 3), then the preimage (π1 × π2)−1(∆) is a curve of genus
5 (resp. 4, 3, 2), and hence contains only ﬁnitely many torsion points of E1 × E2 by Raynaud’s theorem
„
[10].

However, we expect not only the ﬁniteness, but also the existence of a universal bound of the cardinality
of their intersection.

Conjecture 2.

sup

{(K,E1,O1,π1,E2,O2,π2):π1(E1[2])6=π2(E2[2])}

#π1(E1[∞]) ∩ π2(E2[∞]) < ∞

Here the supremum is taken over all K, but clearly we can restrict K = ¯Q or K = C. In section 3, theorem
12 and 13 will indicate that under some mild conditions, the cardinality is small, while theorem 18 will
give a construction to show that it can be at least 14. The main tool to achieve these results is the explicit
calculation of division polynomials, which will be introduced and developed in section 2. Jordan’s totient
function, as an ingredient of division polynomials, will be brieﬂy discussed in the appendix. Calculations
were assisted by Mathematica 10.0 [14].

Traditionally, the division polynomials ψn [12] are deﬁned by the initial values

Notice that

Since char(K) = 0, we can eliminate b8 and the leading coefﬁcients.

E1 and E2 share the sameQk

Now let us go back to the general (E, O, π), and assume that π(O) = ∞. By Riemann-Roch theorem,
there exists an isomorphism φ : E → E′ such that E′ is in generalized Weierstrass form. Then φ induces
¯φ ∈ Aut(P1) ﬁxing ∞, which must be a linear function [5]. Its inverse ¯φ−1 can be lifted to ˆφ : E′ → E′′
such that E′′ remains in generalized Weierstrass form. Thus the general case can be reduced to the
Weierstrass case. Note that we can make everything above deﬁned over K, except possibly ˆφ has to be
deﬁned over a quadratic extension of K.

(D) π1(E1[∞]) = π2(E2[∞]);
(E) π1(E1[∞]) ∩ π2(E2[∞]) is inﬁnite.
Proof. First move π1(O1) and π2(O2) to ∞ by a common fractional linear transformation, and then use

the above argument.

The following corollary gives the converse of theorem 1.

Corollary 7. Given (E1, O1, π1) and (E2, O2, π2), then the following are equivalent:
(A) π1(E1[2]) = π2(E2[2]);
(B) π1(E1[∞]) = π2(E2[∞]);
(C) π1(E1[∞]) ∩ π2(E2[∞]) is inﬁnite.
Proof. Assume (A), if π1(O1) = π2(P) for some P ∈ E2[2], then the translation-by-P map [+P] acts on
E2[2] and E2[∞] bijectively, the quotient map π2◦[+P] satisﬁes π1(O1) = π2◦[+P](O2), which implies

Given theorem 5, it is natural to ask
Question 8. Let E1 and E2 be two elliptic curves in generalized Weierstrass form, if πW (E∗1[n1]) =
πW (E∗2[n2]), can we always conclude that n1 = n2?
If conjecture 2 is true, then the answer must be yes, at least when n1 and n2 are large enough. A
naive attempt is to write their division polynomials more explicitly, and then compare those coefﬁcients.
Clearly, a necessary condition is D(n1) = D(n2). However, since we have, for example,

D(5) = D(6) = 12,

D(35) = D(40) = D(42) = 576,

D(55) = D(57) = D(62) = D(66) = 1440,

D(n) itself does not give a strong restriction on n. Notice that C1,0,0(n) = D(n)/12, so b2(E1) = b2(E2),
we can assume the common value is 0, and consequently b2 disappears in the formulas of fn(x) and
Fn(x). Based on the same approach as before, together with a tedious calculation, we can obtain all the
coefﬁcients C0,s,t (n) for 2s + 3t ≤ 6.

dealt with by another relation which is proved in the same paper.

Remark 10. Clearly, these formulas have some beautiful patterns, which we expect are shared by all
Cr,s,t (n). Speciﬁcally, depending on (r, s, t), each Cr,s,t (n) is an alternating sum of several components,
each component is a product of several subcomponents, and each subcomponent is a positive rational
linear combination of Jk(n).

Theorem 11. Let E1 and E2 be two elliptic curves in generalized Weierstrass form such that πW (E∗1[n1]) =
πW (E∗2[n2]) for some n1 6= n2, then j(E1), j(E2) ∈ ¯Q\{0, 1728}.
Proof. We have assumed b2 = 0, so j = 0 if and only if b4 = 0, and j = 1728 if and only if b6 = 0. Since
πW (E∗1[n1]) = πW (E∗2[n2]), we have

C0,1,0(n1)b4(E1) = C0,1,0(n2)b4(E2),

C0,0,1(n1)b6(E1) = C0,0,1(n2)b6(E2).

Thus there are three cases:
(A) b4(E1) = b4(E2) = 0
We can assume b6(E1), b6(E2) ∈ Q×, then E1 and E2 are both elliptic curves with complex multiplication
by OL, the integer ring of L = Q(p−3). By class ﬁeld theory [9] of imaginary quadratic ﬁelds [13],

L((πW (E∗i [ni]))3) = L((πW (Ei[ni ]))3) = Lni

is the ray class ﬁeld of L module ni . Generally, if two ideals m|n give the same ray class ﬁeld Lm = L n,

Thus the conductor of Ln is n/I (n), Ln1 = Ln2 implies n1 = n2.
(B) b6(E1) = b6(E2) = 0
We can assume b4(E1), b4(E2) ∈ Q×, then E1 and E2 are both elliptic curves with complex multiplication

3 Intersection of Projective Torsion Points

Now let K be a number ﬁeld, GK = Gal( ¯K/K) the absolute Galois group of K,

χK : GK ։ Gal(K c y c/K) ∼= Gal(Qc y c/K ∩ Qc y c) ,→ Gal(Qc y c/Q) ∼= ˆZ×

the cyclotomic character of K. Consider the associated Galois representation

ρE : GK → Aut(E[∞]) ∼= GL(2, ˆZ).

Since χK = det ◦ ρE, we always have ρE(GK c y c ) ⊆ SL(2, ˆZ). Zywina [16] proved that if K 6= Q, then for
almost all elliptic curves deﬁned over K, this is actually an equality, namely, ρE(GK c y c ) = SL(2, ˆZ).

Theorem 12. Given (E1, O1, π1) and (E2, O2, π2), all deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K 6= Q, if
(A) π1(O1) = π2(O2),
(B) corollary 6 does not hold,
(C) ρE1
then

(GK c y c ) = SL(2, ˆZ),

(GK c y c ) = ρE2

#π1(E1[∞]) ∩ π2(E2[∞]) = 1.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a ∈ π1(E∗1[n1]) ∩ π2(E∗2[n2]) for some n1, n2 > 1. By assumption (C),
GK c y c transitively acts on πi(E∗i [ni]), which is therefore the orbit of a, and the degree of a is given by
D(ni ). We also have the exact sequence

as a consequence,

1 → GK c y c (πi (E∗i [ni ])) → GK c y c → PSL(2, Z/ni Z) → 1,

[K c y c(orbit of a) : K c y c(a)] =

[GK c y c : GK c y c (orbit of a)]

[K c y c(a) : K c y c]

=

#PSL(2, Z/ni Z)

D(ni )

= ni,

which implies that n1 = n2, contradicts (A) and (B).

For any σ ∈ GK , σ(p∆) = ε(ρE(σ))p∆, where

„

ε : GL(2, ˆZ) → GL(2, Z/2Z) → {±1}

is the signature character. If K = Q, then p∆ ∈ Qab = Qc y c, so ρE(GQc y c ) ⊆ SL(2, ˆZ)∩ ker(ε), a subgroup
of index 2 in SL(2, ˆZ). Jones [6] proved that for almost all elliptic curves deﬁned over Q, this is actually
an equality, namely, ρE(GQc y c ) = SL(2, ˆZ) ∩ ker(ε).
Theorem 13. Given (E1, O1, π1) and (E2, O2, π2), all deﬁned over Q, if
(A) π1(O1) = π2(O2),
(B) corollary 6 does not hold,
(C) ρE1
then

(GK c y c ) = SL(2, ˆZ) ∩ ker(ε),

(GK c y c ) = ρE2

#π1(E1[∞]) ∩ π2(E2[∞]) = 1.
Proof. The proof is nearly the same as the case K 6= Q, except that

[Qc y c(orbit of a) : Qc y c(a)] =ni ,

ni /2,

if ni is odd,
if ni is even.

If n1 6= n2, then n1 = n2/2 is odd, but which implies D(n1) = D(n2)/3, a contradiction.
Remark 14. If question 8 has an afﬁrmative answer, then the assumption (C) in theorem 12 and 13 can
be weakened by assuming that GK acts on πi(E∗i [ni]) transitively. This suggests that our conjecture 2,
apparently an unlikely intersection type problem [15], might be somewhat related to Serre’s uniformity
conjecture [11].

With the condition π1(O1) = π2(O2) dropped, more intersection points can be obtained. We begin with
the classical results for 3-torsion points and 4-torsion points.
Proposition 15. For any elliptic curve E deﬁned over K, there exists an even morphism π ∈ ¯K(E) of degree
2 such that π(E∗[3]) = {∞, 1, ρ, ρ2}, where ρ is a primitive cube root of unity.
Proof. Consider the family Eλ : x 3 + y 3 + z3 = 3λx yz, which is an elliptic curve provided λ3 6= 1. Its
3-torsion points are

(1 : −1 : 0),
(0 : 1 : −1),
(−1 : 0 : 1),

(1 : −ρ : 0),
(0 : 1 : −ρ),
(−ρ : 0 : 1),






(1 : −ρ2 : 0),

(0 : 1 : −ρ2),



If we take the origin to be Oλ = (1 : −1 : 0), then the quotient map πλ : Eλ → P1, (x : y : z) 7→ −(x + y)/z
maps E∗λ[3] to the desired set. Since every elliptic curve deﬁned over K can be transformed to some Eλ
via an isomorphism deﬁned over ¯K, the conclusion follows.
„
Proposition 16. For any elliptic curve E deﬁned over K, there exists an even morphism π ∈ ¯K(E) of degree
2 such that π(E∗[4]) = {0,∞,±1,±i}, where i is a primitive fourth root of unity.
Proof. Consider the family Eδ : y 2 = x 4 − (δ2 + 1/δ2)x 2 + 1, which is a curve of genus 1 with a
unique singularity at (0 : 1 : 0) provided δ4 6= 0, 1. Its 2-torsion points (±δ±1, 0) respectively induce
x 7→ ±x±1 ∈ Aut(P1) if we take Oδ = (δ, 0), and πδ : Eδ → P1, (x, y) 7→ x. The ﬁxed points of those
nontrivial ones, {0,∞}, {±1}, and {±i}, therefore constitute the collection of πδ(E∗δ[4]). Since every
elliptic curve deﬁned over K can be transformed to some Eδ via a birational isomorphism deﬁned over
¯K, the conclusion follows.
„

Proposition 15 and 16 indicate that for any elliptic curve, the projective 3-torsion points are equivalent to
the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, while the projective 4-torsion points are equivalent to the vertices
of a regular octahedron. It is therefore tempting to guess the projective 5-torsion points are equivalent
to the vertices of a regular icosahedron. However, this is not the case. Following Klein [7], consider the
family

Es,t : y 2 = x 3 − 3(s20 + 228s15 t 5 + 494s10 t 10 − 228s5 t 15 + t 20)x

is not a constant, the projective 5-torsion points are not equivalent to any ﬁxed collection of 12 points.
Although any single π(E∗[2]), π(E∗[3]), or π(E∗[4]) is insufﬁcient to determine π(E[∞]), any pair of
them can do so.

Corollary 17. Given (E1, O1, π1) and (E2, O2, π2), if
(A) π1(E∗1[2]) = π2(E∗2[2]) and π1(E∗1[3]) = π2(E∗2[3]), or
(B) π1(E∗1[2]) = π2(E∗2[2]) and π1(E∗1[4]) = π2(E∗2[4]), or
(C) π1(E∗1[3]) = π2(E∗2[3]) and π1(E∗1[4]) = π2(E∗2[4]),
then π1(O1) = π2(O2). In particular, corollary 6 holds.

Proof. (A) It sufﬁces to show that π(E∗[2]) and π(E∗[3]) determine π(O). By proposition 15, we can
assume π(E∗[3]) = {∞, 1, ρ, ρ2}. Let λ = π(O), and consider (Eλ, Oλ, πλ), since

πλ : Eλ → P1, (x : y : z) 7→ −

x + y

z

=

z2 − 3λx y
x 2 − x y + y 2 ,

we have πλ(Oλ) = λ. By corollary 6, πλ(E∗λ[2]) = π(E∗[2]). Thus we just need to show that πλ(E∗λ[2])
determines λ. Since the points in πλ(E∗λ[2]) are the roots of x 3 + 3λx 2 − 4, this is clear.
(B) πδ(E∗δ[2]) = {−δ, 1/δ,−1/δ} determines δ.
(C) We need to show that πδ(E∗δ[3]) determines δ. The nonsingular model of Eδ is

δ : Y 2 = X (X − 1)(X −

(δ +

where

X =

(δ2 + 1)(δ x − 1)

.

2δ(x − δ)

δ imply the division polynomials of Eδ.

The division polynomials of E s
πδ(E∗δ[3]) are the roots of x 4 + 2δ x 3 − (2/δ)x − 1, then the result is immediate.
Now we are ready to give the main result of this article. For any Eδ1
and Eδ2
, the intersection of
πδ1
[∞]) has at least 6 elements. If it contains another element a, then as we have
seen in the proof of proposition 16, it also contains −a, 1/a, and −1/a. Therefore, its cardinality must
be 4k + 6. If we ﬁx δ1 and vary δ2, then k = 1 can be easily attained. In the next theorem, we construct
an example to improve k = 2.

In particular, the points in

πδ2
quadratic polynomial of δ, any ﬁxed u such that u4 6= 0, 1, and u8 + 14u4 + 1 6= 0 gives exactly two roots

Remark 19. The intersection can also be investigated using Tate’s explicit parametrization of elliptic
curves over p-adic ﬁelds [13]. We plan to explore the details of this approach in the next publication.

4 Appendix: Jordan’s Totient Function

We concern the values taken by Jk(n) as well. J1(n) is simply Euler’s totient function, for which we have
the famous Ford’s theorem [4] and Carmichael’s conjecture [2, 3]. J2(n) is far from being injective,
which prevents a simple answer to question 8. Even their combination is not injective, since

J1(15) = J1(16) = 8,
J2(15) = J2(16) = 192.

It is quite surprising that J3(n) is still not injective, the smallest identical pair is

J3(28268) = J3(28710) = 19764446869440.

We do not know any identical pair for k ≥ 4, and expect that such coincidence should be very rare.
Finally, let us conclude this article with a collection of fragment results:

Proposition 20. Let p, q, p1 6= p2, q1 6= q2 be primes, vp(n) the power of p in the prime decomposition of n,
ω(n) the number of distinct prime divisors of n, then
(A) If J2(ps) = J2(qt ), then ps = qt or {ps, qt} = {7, 8};
(B) If Jk(p1 p2) = Jk(q1q2), k = 2, 4, then p1 p2 = q1q2;
(C) If Jk(m) = Jk(n), k = 2, 4, 6, then vp(m) = vp(n) for p = 2, 3, vp(m) = vp(n) or {vp(m), vp(n)} = {0, 1}
for any other p 6≡ 1 mod 12, and ω(m) = ω(n).

Proof. (A) Now we have p2s−2(p2 − 1) = q2t−2(q2 − 1). If p, q 6= 2 and s, t 6= 1, then p (resp. q) is the
largest prime divisor of left-hand side (resp. right-hand side). Hence p = q and s = t. If p = 2, then
3 · 22s−2 = q2t−2(q2 − 1). Since 4 cannot be a common divisor of q + 1 and q − 1, one of them must be
a divisor of 6. Hence q = 2 and s = t, or {ps, qt} = {7, 8}. If s = 1, then p2 − 1 = q2t−2(q2 − 1). We can
assume q 6= 2, then q cannot be a common divisor of p + 1 and p − 1, so q2t−2 ≤ p ± 1 = (p ∓ 1) ± 2 ≤
(q2 − 1) ± 2, so t = 1 and p = q, or t = 2. If t = 2, then either q2 = p + 1 = (p − 1) + 2 = (q2 − 1) + 2 or
2q2 ≤ p + 1 = (p − 1) + 2 ≤ (q2 − 1)/2 + 2, neither is possible.
(B) It is straightforward that (p2
2 − 1)
imply p1 p2 = q1q2.
(C) Since 2 ∤ p4 + p2 +1 = (p2 + p +1)(p2− p +1), from J6(n)/J2(n) =Qp|n p4vp(n)−4(p4 + p2 +1), we can
see v2(m) = v2(n) or {v2(m), v2(n)} = {0, 1}. Since 3 ∤ p2 + 1, from J4(n)/J2(n) =Qp|n p2vp(n)−2(p2 + 1),
we can see v3(m) = v3(n) or {v3(m), v3(n)} = {0, 1}. This strategy works for any other p 6≡ 1 mod 12,
since either −1 or −3 is a quadratic nonresidue. If v2(m) = 0 and v2(n) = 1, then 5/3 = (22 + 1)/(22 −
2 (m) ≤ Qp≥3(p2 + 1)/(p2 − 1) = 3/2, a contradiction. If v3(m) = 0 and

2 (m) ≤Qp≥5(p2 + 1)/(p2 − 1) = 6/5,
v3(n) = 1, then 5/4 = (32 + 1)/(32 − 1) ≤ J4(n)/J 2
again a contradiction. Moreover, since 2|p2 + 1, but 4 ∤ p2 + 1, from J4(n)/J2(n), we can see ω(m) =
