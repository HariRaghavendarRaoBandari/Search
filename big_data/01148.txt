Abstract

We compute the value of eﬀective photon mass mγ at one-loop level in QED due to the formation

of small spherically symmetric black hole in asymptotically ﬂat spacetime. This eﬀect is associated

with the modiﬁcation of electron/positron propagator during matter collapse. Physical manifesta-

tions of black-hole environment are compared with those of hot neutral plasma. We estimate the

distance to the nearest black hole from the upper bound on mγ obtained in the Coulomb-law test.

We also ﬁnd that corrections to electron mass me and ﬁne structure constant α at one-loop level
in QED are negligibly small in the weak gravity regime.

INTRODUCTION

In Minkowski space the photon acquires an eﬀective mass if it propagates through a
(neutral) plasma of electrons and positrons held at high enough temperature, i.e. T ≫ me.
The eﬀective photon mass mγ turns out to be proportional to temperature T of this electron-
positron plasma at one-loop level [1] (see also [2, 3]). This eﬀect is exponentially suppressed
if the plasma is cold, i.e. T ≪ me [4–6]. This occurs because most of electrons and
positrons are in the ground state at low temperature. This leads in turn to suppression of
photon-electron and photon-positron scattering processes with respect to the photon-photon
scattering which is the higher loop eﬀect [7]. In summary, we have

at one-loop approximation in quantum electrodynamics (QED), where β ≡ 1/T is the inverse
temperature.

There is a comparably recent idea of the assignment of readings of the macroscopic
thermometer with the so-called Wick squared operator [8, 9]. This is also known as the
local temperature operator. Speciﬁcally, if one treats a scalar ﬁeld model with the conformal
coupling to gravity, then one can ﬁnd that h ˆΦ2(x)i = T 2/12 in a thermal state characterized
by temperature T . This was also generalized and treated in curved spacetimes [10–13].
Certain applications in ﬂat space were studied in [14].

Considering a scalar non-interacting ﬁeld model with mass m = me, one can obtain

h ˆΦ2(x)i ≈ T 2(

Nevertheless, it is tempting to conjecture that m2

for the renormalized value of the Wick squared operator in the thermal state described by
temperature T . Thus, a qualitative discrepancy arises between the eﬀective photon mass
squared and h ˆΦ2(x)i at low temperatures. In fact, these quantities are diverse both physically
and mathematically.
γ ∝ h ˆΦ2(x)i holds qualitatively at high
temperatures at the α-order approximation in quantum electrodynamics. If one takes this
relation for granted, then one can predict that the photon acquires an eﬀective mass, for
instance, in the background of small Schwarzschild black holes, i.e. TH ≫ me and M ≫ MPl,
where TH = M 2
2 is the Planck mass.
For these black holes, the size of the event horizon is rH = 2MG/c2 ≪ 3×10−14 m.1

Pl/(8πM) is the Hawking temperature and MPl = (c/G)

1

Indeed, if we consider eternal Schwarzschild geometry with a black hole of mass M, then
physical vacuum corresponds to the Hartle-Hawking state. Far away from the black hole,

1 We assume such black holes exist in nature which were formed through gravitational collapse under

extreme conditions present in early universe [15].

2

i.e. r ≫ rH , we have h ˆΦ2(x)iH ≈ T 2
H/12 for the scalar ﬁeld model conformally coupled
to gravity [16]. If the black hole has formed through the gravitational collapse, then one
might expect the photon possesses an eﬀective mass decreasing with distance as 1/r, because
h ˆΦ2(x)iU ∝ T 2
H (2M/r)2 in the Unruh state [16]. Remarkably, we have recently surmised this
dependence of mγ on the distance to the black hole from a diﬀerent perspective [17].

In this paper we analytically derive the eﬀective photon mass mγ at one-loop level in
QED in asymptotically ﬂat spacetime with a small Schwarzschild black hole. We ﬁnd that
the above relation between the eﬀective photon mass mγ and the expectation value of the
Wick squared operator h ˆΦ2(x)i does qualitatively hold in the high-temperature limit, i.e.
TH ≫ me, for the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh state.

Our result can be interpreted in two ways. Black holes are surrounded by physically
real and thermally distributed Hawking particles, or black holes modify the electromagnetic
properties of the vacuum (like conducting plates in the Casimir set-up [18, 19]). The former
interpretation is inconsistent with one of the quantum principles, namely unitarity [20].
However, it implies there should exist collective modes like in the hot plasma. Speciﬁcally,
the longitudinal photon aka plasmon is mediated by the plasma particles (e.g., see [2]). The
later interpretation is fully consistent with the principles of local quantum ﬁeld theory [21]
(no “ﬁrewalls” suggested in [22] as well). However, it implies the collective modes cannot
exist as the Unruh (U) state outside of the support of the black-hole core of macroscopic size
l < rH is empty, because it is a vacuum state (see [21] for more detail and [23] for how the
black-hole core may look like using the string theory formalism, wherein, however, l = rH).
The size of the black-hole core l is dynamically generated and is not too smaller than rH.
In this picture, black holes evaporate through the release of energy during the formation of
the black-hole core which stops whenever l & rH [21]. This process still can last very long if
the hole is large. The analogue of this in nuclear physics is the energy release when a bound
state of particles forms.

The connection between this energy release and the renormalized stress tensor h ˆT µ
ν iU of
the quantum ﬁelds should be non-trivial. Indeed, the negative energy ﬂux due to h ˆT t
riU 6= 0
towards the hole happens well outside of the horizon as that was pointed out in [24] and
recently in [25]. However, the stress tensor h ˆT µ
ν iU is associated with the Unruh vacuum state
which is full of non-local quantum ﬂuctuations. Thus, it is a highly non-classical process.

In this paper we shall also show that the analogy between the hot plasma and the small
black-hole environment formed through the gravitational collapse is indeed incomplete in
that the black-hole environment cannot support plasmon-like and plasmino-like excitations.
However, a point-like electric charge can be partially screened due to the modiﬁcation of
the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of the vacuum in the black-hole
background.

Throughout this paper the fundamental constants are set to unity, c = G = kB =  = 1,

unless stated otherwise.

II. EFFECTIVE PHOTON MASS

To compute the photon self-energy at one-loop level in the background of evaporating
Schwarzschild black hole, we need to have the free fermion propagator S(x, x′). Since the

Dirac equation (cid:0)i /∇ − me(cid:1)ψ(x) = 0 can also be written as (cid:0)(cid:3) + m2
however, to deduce the scalar propagator G(x, x′). Indeed, the propagator S(x, x′) can then
be obtained by acting on G(x, x′) by the operator i /∇ + me (e.g., see [26]).

e(cid:1)ψ(x) = 0, it is enough,

A. Scalar Wightman function

As pointed out above, we need to compute the scalar two-point function in spacetime

with the Schwarzschild black hole of mass M. We start with a massive scalar ﬁeld

(cid:0)(cid:3) + m2

e(cid:1)Φ(x) = 0 ,

and look for positive frequency modes in the following form

where r∗ = r + rH ln(r/rH − 1) is the Regge-Wheeler radial coordinate and prime stands for
diﬀerentiation with respect to r. There are two types of radial modes, namely the ingoing
and outgoing one. We denote these as ~Rωl(r) for the ingoing modes and ~Rωl(r) for the
outgoing modes. The Wightman two-point function, e.g. in the Boulware (B) state, is then

It is hardly possible to solve this radial mode equation (5) analytically, but one can always
do that numerically. However, employing results of [16, 27, 28], we obtain in the limit of

Hence, the scalar two-point function in the case when the outgoing and ingoing modes are
“heated up” to inverse temperatures β1 and β2, respectively, is

The Hartle-Hawking state corresponds to β1 = β2 = β = 2π/κ, where κ is a value of the
surface gravity on the horizon r = rH [30]. The Boulware state follows from the Hartle-
Hawking one if we set β1 = β2 = +∞ [31]. The physical state for black holes formed through
the gravitational collapse is known as the Unruh state [32]. This corresponds to β1 = β and
β2 = +∞.

We now deﬁne the commutator function

C(x, x′) = ~C(x, x′) + ~C(x, x′)

which will be used below, where

~C(x, x′) = ~Wβ1(x, x′) − ~Wβ1(x′, x) ≈

~C(x, x′) = ~W β2(x, x′) − ~W β2(x′, x) ≈

It is worth noting that the commutator functions deﬁned in the above manner do not depend
on the temperatures.2 In general, this occurs because the commutator of the ﬁeld operators
plays a role of the algebraic structure of the algebra of local ﬁeld operators. This structure
is independent on Fock space representations of the algebra. Hence, it remains the same,
for instance, independent on whether one treats the Boulware or Unruh state.

B. Spinor Feynman propagator

In general, fermion anti-commutation function ∆f (x, x′) is related with the scalar com-

mutator function as follows

Cf (x, x′) = ~Cf (x, x′) + ~C f (x, x′) = (cid:0)i /∇ + me(cid:1)C(x, x′) ,

where

~Cf (x, x′) = ~Sβ1(x, x′) + ~Sβ1(x′, x) ,
~C f (x, x′) = ~Sβ2(x, x′) + ~Sβ2(x′, x) .

(14)

(15a)

(15b)

To compute one-loop contribution to the photon self-energy, one needs to ﬁnd the Feyn-
man propagator S(x, x′). This can be expressed through the anti-commutation function [33].
Speciﬁcally, we have

S(ω|x, x′) = Z dω′

2π

iCf (ω′|x, x′)
ω − ω′ + iε − nβ1(ω) ~Cf (ω|x, x′) − nβ2(ω) ~C f (ω|x, x′) ,

where ε → +0, the integral is over all ω′ lying in R,

nβ(ω) =

1

,

eβω + 1

(16)

(17)

and Cf (ω|x, x′) is the Fourier transform over time of the anti-commutator function, i.e.

Cf (ω|x, x′) ≡ Z d∆t e+iω∆tCf (x, x′) = Z d∆t e+iω∆t(cid:0)i /∇x + me(cid:1)C(x, x′) ,

where C(x, x′) is the scalar commutator given in (12).

C. Photon self-energy at one-loop level

In terms of the photon Feynman propagator, we have up to the α2-order in the pertur-

bation theory

Since the black hole is small, we are working in the high-temperature limit. Consequently,
we are allowed to use the hard thermal loop approximation [2, 3]. In other words, we omit
the electron mass me in the fermion correlation functions as well as the frequency ω as
being negligible with respect to the temperature parameter TH. Therefore, it is legitimate
to employ the correlation functions found above in the limit me → 0 to obtain the eﬀective
photon mass in the temperature regime TH ≫ me and TH ≫ ω.

Minkowski space One can employ the Feynman propagator given in (16) to compute
the eﬀective photon mass at one-loop level in the high-temperature limit. This is achieved
through setting β1 = β2 = 1/T > 0 and substituting M = 0 in (8) and (9). The vanishing
mass of the black hole implies that |Bω|2 = 0, because |Bω|2 ≈ 27ω2M 2 in the DeWitt
approximation [27].

Our computation of the photon mass in the hot plasma will be non-standard if we work in
γ ≈ e2T 2/6 as the theory

the spherical coordinates. Nevertheless, we still have the result m2
is covariant.

In Minkowski space we can express (20) and (21) through the Cartesian coordinates and
then perform standard evaluations of the integrals. However, we can do the same when
M 6= 0 far from the hole r ≫ rH. Comparing then the right-hand sides of (20) in Minkowski
space and Schwarzschild space far from the black hole, we can immediately obtain the photon
mass mγ due to the black hole in the weak gravity regime.

7

Schwarzschild space The scalar propagator can be computed exactly in Minkowski
space. This is not the case in Schwarzschild space even in the limit of the vanishing electron
mass me. Our expressions for ~Kω(x, x′) and ~K ω(x, x′) given in (8) and (9), respectively, are
reliable whenever the points x and x′ are close to each other.

The physical idea now is to notice that although one must integrate in (20) over all values
of y, the main contribution to the integral will be from the spacial region in the vicinity
of the point x.
In other words, the virtual electron-positron pair depicted in ﬁg. 1 is a
short-time or local event in spacetime.

This can also be exempliﬁed by the computation of the photon self-energy in-between
conducting plates in the Casimir set-up. The photon propagator in-between the conducting
plates diﬀers from that in Minkowski space due to non-trivial boundary conditions satisﬁed
by the electromagnetic four-potential operator on the plates. The two-loop contribution
to the photon self-energy after renormalization is then non-trivial, because of the internal
photon propagator in the loops [18]. In the coordinate representation of the loop integrals,
one would need to integrate over the whole spacetime. However, the main contribution will
be when the vertices are close to each other. For instance, the result will be independent
on the contributions from the points outside of the plates, where the photon propagator
diﬀers from that in-between the plates. This is fully consistent with computations based on
the eﬀective action of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (fermion degrees of freedom are integrated
out) at one-loop level in which one merely needs to have the propagator at spacetime points
being close to each other [19].

Thus, we ﬁnd that the massless scalar Feynman propagator in the momentum space far

from the black hole is given by

GU (k, k′) ≈ (cid:18) i

k2 + iε

+ 2π(cid:18) 27M 2

4R2 (cid:19) nβ(ω)δ(cid:0)k2(cid:1)(cid:19) δ(cid:0)k − k′(cid:1)

at TH ≫ me and TH ≫ ω in the Unruh state, where k = (ω, k) and R is a distance to the
center of the black hole. It is worth noticing that GU (k, k′) reduces to the ordinary scalar
propagator in Minkowski space in the limit of the vanishing black-hole mass. This is not
the case for the Hartle-Hawking state.

Having derived the propagator (22), we can now obtain mγ at the one-loop approximation.

far from the hole (R ≫ rH) in the high-temperature limit (TH ≫ me and M ≫ MPl). The
formula (23) is the main result of our paper. It is worth noticing that mγ does not directly
depend on the black-hole mass M at one-loop level in the leading order of the weak gravity
limit.3

3 Note that we have taken into account only electron-positron virtual pair to the photon self-energy. For

This formula can also be rewritten through the eﬀective emitting radius ra recently in-

troduced in [25]. This radius is deﬁned as ra = 3√3M. Thus, we have

which resembles (1) at T ≫ me up to the geometrical sector, speciﬁcally the ratio of surface
areas at r = ra and r = R.

For the Hartle-Hawking state we obtain the standard result for mγ far away from the
hole like in the hot physical plasma in Minkowski space. Hence, small eternal black holes
would considerably inﬂuence photon kinematics. This is not a problem, because these black
holes are not realizable through the gravitational collapse anyway.

In the Standard Model the electromagnetic ﬁeld corresponds to the U(1) gauge group
under which the vacuum is invariant. This U(1) group is a subgroup of the spontaneously
broken electroweak symmetry SU(2)L × U(1)Y . The electroweak phase transition occurs at
the electroweak energy scale MEW ≈ 102 GeV. The temperature parameter TH for the small
black holes is greater than MEW if the black-hole mass M . 1015MPl. It is not clear whether
one can rely on (23) when the black-hole masse is smaller than 1015MPl. However, we expect
that (23) is still reliable at least far from the black hole, because all physical parameters are
then small (see below). It is still not excluded that the phase transition may occur near the
horizon region.

III. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The spacetime structure signiﬁcantly changes when a black hole forms. The algebraic
structure of a set of the quantum ﬁeld operators also modiﬁes. As a consequence, propaga-
tors of quantum ﬁelds have a diﬀerent form in comparison with that in Minkowski space. Far
from black holes, one might expect that quantum ﬁeld theory becomes almost indistinguish-
able from its formulation in Minkowski spacetime. In other words, quantum ﬁeld theory
formulated in Minkowski space is well tested and veriﬁed in the particle colliders, although
there are a lot of gravitational sources in our universe which make it to be non-Minkowskian
at suﬃciently large length scales.

Although it is legitimate to await of recovering Minkowskian quantum ﬁeld theory far
from black holes, there must be speciﬁc imprints of these gravitational sources in physical
experiments performed on earth. In this paper, we have investigated these imprints of the
small spherically symmetric black hole (TH ≫ me and M ≫ MPl) on the eﬀective photon
mass at the α-order approximation in QED. Physically, it occurs due to having an event

instance, the same result holds for the muon-antimuon virtual pair, but then the black hole should be
smaller TH ≫ mµ ≫ me for the hard loop approximation to be applicable. If TH ≫ mµ holds, then m2
is 2 times larger.

horizon which leads to a signiﬁcant change of the quantum ﬁeld operators, rather than due
to having a hot plasma of electrons and positrons like in a thermal state in Minkowski space
at the temperatures to be much larger than the electron mass. We could interpret this eﬀect
as due to a hot plasma of Hawking electrons and Hawking positrons, but then we should
accept a phase transition during black-hole formation. In fact, these particles are elements
of the non-Minkwoskian Fock space representation of the ﬁeld operator algebra far from the
hole where one expects to have the ordinary representation [21].

The Wick squared operator cannot always be interpreted as a macroscopic temperature
squared [12]. Moreover, the photon mass mγ for the Boulware state vanishes. However,
the Wick squared h ˆΦ2(x)iB is non-zero and negative. Speciﬁcally, h ˆΦ2(x)iB ∝ −T 2

as this can be shown employing the Page approximation [28]. Therefore, the qualitative

We found in [17] that the two-loop or, possibly, even higher-loop eﬀect is dominant
far from the small black holes if the wave-length λγ of the electromagnetic radiation is
in the range λe ≪ λγ ≪ α
2 λe(TH/me), where λe is the Compton length of the electron.

However, the one-loop dominance occurs whenever α

Plasma-like environment of black hole

Quantum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic and fermion ﬁeld around the black holes
reveal plasma-like properties. This can be characterized by the modiﬁcation of the electric
permittivity ǫ(ω, k, R) and the magnetic permeability µ(ω, k, R) of the vacuum. This is
analogous to a similar phenomenon in the Casimir set-up [18, 19]. Note that ǫ(ω, k, R) =
1/µ(ω, k, R) in the limit M → 0 as in the Minkowski vacuum, because the second term
in (22) vanishes.

The ordinary hot plasma is characterized by two parameters, namely α and temperature
TH. The black-hole plasma-like environment is described by one more parameter which is of
the order of TH (2M/R). Although the temperature parameter TH is large with respect to
me, the plasma-like environment is “cold” in the sense the plasma-like frequency ωp is small

4 Note that all divergencies in the evaluation of mγ has been subtracted, such that mγ vanishes in the
Boulware state. The result of this renormalization is ﬁnite and depends on the parameter TH. The Wick
squared operator depends on how one renormalizes it. Usually, one deﬁnes this operator as follows

ˆΦ2(x) = lim

The photon propagator has the longitudinal and transverse part in the hot plasma [1].
The longitudinal part becomes a propagating degree of freedom (a collective mode mediated
by the plasma particles) known as plasmon for frequencies ωl ∼ ωp, while the transverse
part, photon, is dynamical for ωt ≥ ωp. In the black-hole background, it implies that there
should exist a plasmon-like excitation. However, the plasmon wavelength λp ∼ 102 R is
much bigger than R. In general, our approximation is only reliable for λγ ≪ R as pointed
out above. Thus, there are no plasmon-like waves in the black-hole background as in the
hot plasma.

The physical plasma is opaque for electromagnetic waves with frequency ω less than the
plasma frequency. Thus, these electromagnetic waves are reﬂected due to the collective
response of the plasma particles. The poles in the photon propagator also disappear at
ω < ωp close to the black hole. For instance, we ﬁnd that the region rH ≪ R . 1 nm should
be opaque for the light wave of length λγ ≈ 500 nm. Therefore, we have λγ ≫ R. In the hot
plasma of the size R, one would expect merely a negligible damping of the wave amplitude.
We expect the same eﬀect for the small black holes due to the non-trivial manifestation of
vacuum ﬂuctuations. The reﬂection of the light waves from the plasma-like environment of
the black hole should be an extremely rare event.

The plasma frequency in the ordinary plasma is a classical quantity, i.e. that does not
depend on the Planck constant . Indeed, one has ω2
p = 4πe2n/me in the cold plasma, where
n is a density number of the plasma particles [36, 37]. In the hot physical plasma n ∼ T 3
and me ∼ T , so that we have ω2
p = e2T 2/9 for the neutral
electron-positron plasma (e.g., see [2]). However, our result (23) cannot be understood
classically, because of the quantum nature of the temperature parameter TH ∝ .

p ∼ e2T 2. In particular, we have ω2

Note that the numerical factor can deviate from its exact value as we have been working in
the DeWitt approximation for |Bω|2. The same scaling dependence of the temperature from
the distance has been recently found in [23] within the framework of string theory.

Modiﬁed Coulomb law

One can employ our formula (23) to estimate a distance to the nearest small black hole
from the upper bound on the photon mass. In the hot physical plasma, Coulomb’s potential

11

of a point-like electric charge is exponentially suppressed far from the charge as exp(−r/rD),
where rD = 1/mD = (√2mγ)−1 is the Debye radius. This phenomenon is known as the Debye
screening (e.g., see [2, 3] and [36, 37] in the case of the hot and cold plasma, respectively).
In our situation, the electromagnetic ﬁeld eﬀectively becomes a short range interaction.

We obtain from mγ . 10−14 eV [38] that the small black hole at that time could not be

closer to the laboratory than R, where

R ≈ 7×105 R⊙(cid:18)10−18 eV

mγ (cid:19) & 210 km ,

(27)

where R⊙ ≈ 3 km is sun’s gravitational radius. Note that if one neglects any other possible
contributions to the eﬀective photon mass, then the stronger upper bound on mγ, the farther
black hole should be from the laboratory.

It is worth emphasizing that the Debye screening of the charge due to the hole cannot be
complete, because the Debye radius is much bigger than R, speciﬁcally rD & 8.8×104 km.
Note that the fact R ≪ rD does not imply our approximation is unreliable. Indeed, the
conducting shell used in [38] to test the Coulomb law has a size about 1 m which is much
smaller than the distance to the hole R.

In the physical plasma the Debye screening occurs due to the collective response of
the plasma particles to the external electric charge. In our case, it is due to the vacuum
polarization eﬀect. In the absence of the black hole or very far away from it, the photon
is almost massless at any order of the perturbation theory due to the gauge and Lorentz
symmetry. Not too far from the hole, spacetime isometry starts to signiﬁcantly deviate
from the Minkowskian one due to the black-hole horizon. As a consequence, the vacuum
response to the electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the electric permittivity and magnetic
permeability modiﬁes. This eventually results in the non-trivial photon dispersion relation.
A similar eﬀect occurs in-between the conducting plates, wherein, however, photons remain
massless [18, 19].

In the context of higher-dimensional theories of gravity, the energy scale M∗ below which
quantum gravity starts to play a signiﬁcant role could be about 1 TeV [39]. In this case one
must assume M ≫ M∗ to be able to employ the semi-classical approximation, rather than
M ≫ MPl. At the distances R ≫ rex, where rex is a size of the extra dimensions, our results
should be applicable, because the higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole goes over to
the ordinary four-dimensional one [40]. Therefore, the Coulomb-law test could perhaps be
of interest if microscopic black holes have been producing in high-energy collision processes
in LHC [41].

One-loop correction to electron mass me and ﬁne structure constant α

The electron mass is also modiﬁed in the black-hole background. Following [34, 35] (see

also [2, 3]), we obtain at one-loop level

δme ≈ (cid:18) 27πα
32 (cid:19)

1

2

TH(cid:18) 2M
R (cid:19)

(28)

This correction to me is negligibly small if R ≫ 4.4×10−15 m. It is worth mentioning that
classical estimate of the electron size is about 2.8×10−15 m. In the hot plasma, the thermal
correction δme to the electron mass is much bigger than me. In our case, this correction
to me is suppressed by the factor 2M/R. Hence, we have me ≫ δme, although TH ≫ me.
This implies there are no plasmino-like excitations in the background of evaporating black
hole. This is fully consistent with of having no mediator due to which these collective modes
could propagate.

The temperature-dependent correction to the ﬁne structure constant α in the hot plasma

has been derived in [42]. In the background of the small black hole we ﬁnd

α(M) ≈ α(cid:18)1 +

(29)

Note that the eﬀective ﬁne structure constant α(M) approaches α in the limit M → 0. Its
maximal value in the range MPl ≪ M ≪ 1021MPl slightly diﬀers from α. Speciﬁcally, the
deviation of α(M) from α is much smaller than 10−8 for those values of the black-hole mass.
At the distance 1 m from the black hole, this deviation becomes 10−15 times smaller.

Black holes in analogue gravity

The eﬀect we have derived in this paper is due to the interaction between photons and
electrons/positrons. In the λΦ4-model, the massless scalar particle acquires an eﬀective mass
mΦ in the background of black holes as well. Following [2], one can obtain

Φ ≈

H(cid:16)rH
R(cid:17)2

(30)

at one-loop level far from the black hole. It is worth emphasizing that the black-hole mass
M is only supposed here to be much larger than the Planck mass MPl. We shall treat this
theory in a forthcoming paper [43] near evaporating black holes, where one may expect a
breakdown of the perturbation theory analogous to that observed in [17].

There is an analogue of black holes in a medium known as a dumb hole [44] and [45]
for a comprehensive review of analogue gravity. Experimental evidences have been recently
reported in favor of the dumb-hole evaporation which is supposed to be analogous to the
black-hole evaporation [46, 47].

13

For ﬂuids in which phonons are self-interacting, one might expect a non-trivial disper-
sion relation for the phonon similar to that for the photon far from the small black hole.
Speciﬁcally, an eﬀective phonon mass might depend on the distance to the sonic horizon.
