Abstract

It is well known that the nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation is a very important inte-
grable equation. Ablowitz and Musslimani introduced and investigated an integrable nonlocal
NLS equation through inverse scattering transform. Very recently, we proposed an integrable
nonlocal modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) which can also be found in a paper of
Ablowitz and Musslimani. We have constructed the Darboux transformation and soliton solu-
tions for the nonlocal mKdV equation. In this paper, we will investigate further the nonlocal
mKdV equation. We will give its exact solutions including soliton and breather through inverse
scattering transformation. These solutions have some new properties, which are diﬀerent from
the ones of the mKdV equation.

Introduction

As is well known, the nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation

iqt(x, t) = qxx(x, t) ± 2|q(x, t)|2q(x, t)

(1)

has been investigated deeply since the important work of Zakharov and Shabat [1].
In physical
ﬁelds, the NLS equation can characterize plenty of models in varies aspects, such as nonlinear optics
[2], plasma physics [3], deep water waves [4] and in purely mathematics like motion of curves in
diﬀerential geometry [5].
In fact, the NLS equation can be derived from the theory of deep water

wave, and also from the Maxwell equation. It should be noted that the NLS equation is parity-time-
symmetry (PT-symmetry), which has becomed an interesting topic in quantum mechanics [6], optics
[7, 8], Bose-Einstein condensates [9] and quantum chromodynamics [10], etc.

A nonlocal NLS equation has been introduced by Ablowitz and Musslimani in [11]:

iqt(x, t) = qxx(x, t) ± 2q(x, t)q∗(−x, t)q(x, t).

(2)

It can be yielded from the famous AKNS system. As the NLS equation (1), the nonlocal NLS equation
(2) is also PT-symmetric. It is an integrable system with the Lax pair. Ablowitz and Musslimani gave
its inﬁnitely many conservation laws and solved it through the inverse scattering transformation [11].
Eq.(2) has diﬀerent properties from eq.(1), e.g., eq.(2) contains both bright and dark soliton [12] and
solutions with periodic singularities [11].

Very recently, motivated by the work of nonlocal NLS equation due to Ablowitz and Musslimani,

we proposed and investigated a nonlocal modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation in [13],

qt(x, t) + 6q(x, t)q(−x, −t)qx(x, t) + qxxx(x, t) = 0.

(3)

Its Lax integrability, Darboux transformation, and soliton solution have been discussed in our paper
[13]. We should remark here that the nonlocal mKdV equation (3) also occurred in a paper of Ablowitz
and Musslimani [14]. It is obvious that the nonlocal mKdV equation (3) with the reduction q(−x, −t) =
q(x, t) reduces to the mKdV equation. The mKdV equation can be derived from Euler equation and
has applications in varies physical ﬁelds [15, 16]. Wadati used inverse scattering transformation to
study mKdV equation and obtained explicit solutions, including N -solitons, multiple-pole solutions
and solutions derived from PT-symmetric potentials [17, 18, 19]. Hirota also achieved N -solitons by
bilinear technique and investigated multiple collisions of solitons [20].

In this paper, we will investigate further the new integrable nonlocal mKdV equation (3). We will
construct exact solutions of the nonlocal mKdV equation (3) including soliton and breather through
inverse scattering transformation. These solutions have some new properties, which are diﬀerent from
the ones of the mKdV equation.

Inverse scattering transformation on nonlocal mKdV equation

The invention of inverse scattering transformation (IST) is due to the pioneering work of Gardner,
Greene, Kruskal, and Miura for the Cauchy problem of KdV equation [21]. IST has been developed
into a systematic method to achieve exact solutions for integrable nonlinear systems [22, 23, 24]. In

2

this section, we will give the IST for the nonlocal mKdV equation (3). Start with the following linear
problem,

ϕx = Uϕ = (−ikσ3 + Q)ϕ,
ϕt = Vϕ = (−4ik3σ3 + 4k2Q − 2ikV1 + V2)ϕ,

V1 = (Q2 + Qx)σ3,

V2 = −Qxx + 2Q3 + QxQ − QQx,

where ϕ = (ϕ1(x, t), ϕ2(x, t))T, and k is the spectral parameter. The compatibility condition of system
(4) and (5) Ut − Vx + [U, V] = 0 leads to

qt(x, t) + qxxx(x, t) − 6q(x, t)r(x, t)qx(x, t) = 0,

rt(x, t) + rxxx(x, t) − 6q(x, t)r(x, t)rx(x, t) = 0.

Nonlocal mKdV equation (3) is obtained from system (6) under the reduction

r(x, t) = −q(−x, −t).

(6)

(7)

Next, following the standard procedure of inverse scattering transformation(e.g. see [23],[24], [14]), we
will give the inverse scattering for nonlocal mKdV equation. Assume q(x, t) and its derivatives with
respect to x vanish rapidly at inﬁnity. So does r(x, t). Fix time t = 0. Deﬁne φ(x, k) and ¯φ(x, k) as a
pair of eigenfunctions of eq.(4), which satisfy the following boundary conditions,

φ(x, k) ∼  1

0 ! e−ikx,

¯φ(x, k) ∼  0

1 ! eikx,

x → −∞.

(8)

Similarly, ψ(x, k) and ¯ψ(x, k) are deﬁned as another pair of eigenfunctions of eq.(4) satisfying a diﬀerent
boundary conditions,

ψ(x, k) ∼  0

1 ! eikx,

¯ψ(x, k) ∼  1

0 ! e−ikx,

x → +∞.

(9)

Note that, in this paper, we denote the complex conjugation of φ by φ∗ instead of ¯φ. Furthermore, φ
and ψ are required to be analytic in upper half k-plane, while ¯φ and ¯ψ are required to be analytic in
lower half k-plane. For a solution u(x, k) and v(x, k) to eq.(4), their Wronskian W [u, v] = u1v2 − u2v1
is independent of x. Since {φ, ¯φ} and {ψ, ¯ψ} are linearly dependent, we set

φ(x, k) = a(k) ¯ψ(x, k) + b(k)ψ(x, k),
¯φ(x, k) = ¯a(k)ψ(x, k) + ¯b(k) ¯ψ(x, k).

(10)

3

The scattering data therefore can be expressed as

b(k) = W [ψ(x, k), ¯φ(x, k)],
a(k) = W [φ(x, k), ψ(x, k)],
¯a(k) = W [ ¯ψ(x, k), ¯φ(x, k)], ¯b(k) = W [ ¯φ(x, k), ψ(x, k)].

(11)

One can prove that φeikx, ψe−ikx and a(k) are analytic functions in upper half k-plane; ¯φe−ikx,
¯ψeikx and ¯a(k) are analytic functions in lower half k-plane [23]. Deﬁne ρ(k) = b(k)/a(k) and ¯ρ(k) =
¯b(k)/¯a(k) as reﬂection coeﬃcients. Assume km (m = 1, 2, · · · , N ), the zeros of a(k) in upper half
k-plane, are single, as well as ¯kn (n = 1, 2, · · · , ¯N ) denoted as the zeros of ¯a(k) in lower half k-plane.
When a(km) = 0, by eq.(11), it yields that φ(x, km) and ψ(x, km) are linearly dependent, i.e. there
exist constants γj such that φ(x, km) = γmψ(x, km). Similarly, one has ¯φ(x, ¯kn) = ¯γn ¯ψ(x, ¯kn). The
normalizing coeﬃcients {cm, ¯cn} are deﬁned by

c2
m =

˙a(km)

(m = 1, 2, · · · , N );

¯c2
n =

i¯γn
˙¯a(¯kn)

,

(n = 1, 2, · · · , ¯N ).

(12)

We should note that, under the reduction (7), the scattering data obeys b(k) = −¯b(−k∗), a(k) =
a∗(−k∗) and ¯a(k) = ¯a∗(−k∗), when q(x) is a real function. This means the eigenvalues are purely
imaginary or appear in pairs {km, −k∗

m} and {¯kn, −¯k∗

n}.

Suppose the eigenfunctions ψ and ¯ψ satisfy the following forms:

ψ(x, k) =  0
¯ψ(x, k) =  1

0 ! e−ikx +Z ∞

where K(x, s) = (K1(x, s), K2(x, s))T and ¯K(x, s) = ( ¯K1(x, s), ¯K2(x, s))T, x < s. Substituting eq.(13)
into eq.(4) yields that K1(x, s) and K2(x, s) satisfy a Goursat problem, which means that the solution
exists and is unique. Moreover, one can get the relations between potentials and K(x, y) and ¯K(x, y):

q(x) = −2K1(x, x),

r(x) = −2 ¯K2(x, x).

The time evolution of scattering data {ρ(k, t), ¯ρ(k, t)} and normalizing coeﬃcients {c2

m, ¯c2

n} are

given by

ρ(k, t) = ρ(k, 0)e8ik3 t,

(17)

Then, putting eq.(17) into eq.(15) and solving GLM eq.(16) yields K(x, y; t) and ¯K(x, y; t). Finally
the solutions q(x, t) and r(x, t) are constructed. Assume the scattering problem is reﬂectionless, i.e.
ρ(k, t) = ¯ρ(k, t) ≡ 0 and K1(x, y), ¯K2(x, y) have the following expressions:

K1(x, y) =

¯cn(t)¯gn(x, t)e−i¯kny,

¯K2(x, y) =

hm(x, t) = cm(t)eikmx,

¯hn(x, t) = ¯cn(t)e−i¯knx,

enm(x, t) =

hm(x, t)¯hn(x, t)

.

After some calculations, q(x, t) and r(x, t) are written

q(x, t) = −2tr(cid:0)(I ¯N + E(x, t)E(x, t)T)−1¯h(x, t)¯h(x, t)T(cid:1) ,
r(x, t) = −2tr(cid:0)(IN + E(x, t)TE(x, t))−1h(x, t)h(x, t)T(cid:1) ,

(19)

where IN or I ¯N is a N -dimensional or ¯N -dimensional unit matrix. When eigenvalues {km, ¯kn} are
suitably selected and eq.(19) satisﬁes the constraint (7), q(x, t) becomes the solution of eq.(3) with
initial scattering data {cm(0), ¯cn(0)}.
We will emphasize here that the procedure described above of solving nonlocal mKdV equation seems
same as the one for the classical mKdV equation, but there exists important diﬀerence between these
two cases. The scattering coeﬃcients a(k) and ¯a(k) for the nonlocal case have no relations, while
ones of classical problems have. This leads to that eigenvalues kj, ¯kj are not related, either. The
normalizing coeﬃcients cj, ¯cj depend on the eigenvalues kj, ¯kj in the nonlocal case, which will be
mentioned in the next section, rather than being free parameters in the classical case. In the classical
case, eigenfunctions, which are analytic in the upper k-plane, are related to those being analytic in
the lower k-plane. But, this property does not hold anymore in the nonlocal case. This is the most
important diﬀerence between these two cases, which is also mentioned in [14].

3 Soliton solutions and their properties

In this section, we will derive soliton solutions of integrable nonlocal mKdV equation (3) from the
explicit formula (19).

Case 1. one-soliton solutions
Let N = ¯N = 1 and the eigenvalues be purely imaginary. From formula (19) and the symmetry
reduction (7), it can be derived that c1(0), ¯c1(0) and k1, ¯k1 have the following constraints:

(k1 − ¯k1)2 + (c1(0))4 = 0,

(k1 − ¯k1)2 + (¯c1(0))4 = 0.

(20)

Denote k = iα and ¯k = −iβ, where α, β > 0. Substituting the above constraints into eq.(19) yields
the one-soliton solution

q(x, t) =

2(α + β)

e−2α(x−4α2t) + σe2β(x−4β2t)

,

(21)

(22)

where σ = ±1. Let σ = 1, q can be written

q(x, t) = (α + β)e(α−β)x−4(α3 −β3)t sech((α + β)x − 4(α3 + β3)t).

It is obvious that for arbitrary ﬁxed t, q(x, t) → 0 as |x| → ∞. This solution q(x, t) of nonlocal
mKdV equation is a soliton solution, but it has diﬀerent property from the one of classical mKdV
equation. We note that, when x and t satisfy x/t = k + o(t−1) (t → ∞), where k is a constant between
4α2 and 4β2, q(x, t) goes to inﬁnity along these directions as t → +∞ for α < β, or t → −∞ for
α > β. It indicates that q(x, t) evolves like a solitary wave with its amplitude increasing or decaying
exponentially. Fig. 1 describes this property. We can see that q(x, t) is a usual soliton in the case of
α = β. Notice that in this case q(x, t) = q(−x, −t), and ¯k1 = k∗
1. This means that q(x, t) is also a
soliton solution to mKdV equation. If σ = −1,

q(x, t) = −(α + β)e(α−β)x−4(α3 −β3)t csch((α + β)x − 4(α3 + β3)t).

(23)

So, q(x, t) possesses singularity at the line {(x, t)|x = 4(α2 − αβ + β2)t}.
Case 2. two-soliton solutions
Set N = ¯N = 2. First, we obtain the constraints between normalizing coeﬃcients and eigenvalues via
eq.(19) and eq.(7) by direct calculations:

(c1(0))4 +

(¯c1(0))4 +

(¯k1 − k1)2(¯k2 − k1)2

(k1 − k2)2

(k1 − ¯k1)2(k2 − ¯k1)2

(¯k1 − ¯k2)2

= 0,

(c2(0))4 +

= 0,

(¯c2(0))4 +

(¯k1 − k2)2(¯k2 − k2)2

(k1 − ¯k2)2(k2 − ¯k2)2

(¯k1 − ¯k2)2

= 0,

= 0.

(j = 1, 2).

Here, we focus on the case of {kj, ¯kj }2
αj, βj > 0, and σj = ¯σj = 1 (j = 1, 2). For (α1 − α2)(β1 − β2) > 0, eq.(25) is simpliﬁed to

j=1 being purely imaginary. Set kj = iαj, ¯kj = −iβj, where

q(x, t) =

2F1(x, t)

,

F1(x, t) = A[(α1 + β1)eu2− cosh(u2+ + θ2) + (α2 + β2)eu1− cosh(u1+ + θ1)],

|α2 − α1|(α2 + β1)

|α2 − α1|(α1 + β2)

This is a two-soliton solution. In ﬁg. 2, we describe such a two-soliton with α1 < β1 and α2 = β2.
In this case, we see that the amplitude of one solitary wave has exponential increase as t → +∞,
and another amplitude is stable but has a change during the collision of the two solitary waves.
Furthermore, after interaction of the two solitary waves, there is a shift of phase and no change in
the speed of them. Fig. 3 gives the case of α1 < β1 and α2 > β2, i.e., the amplitude of a solitary
wave increases exponentially, and the one of another solitary wave decreases exponentially. The all
solutions above belong to the interactions of bright-bright solitons. Interactions of bright-dark solitons
can be found by setting σ2 = −1 and ¯σ2 = −1. The results are similar to the bright-bright case. In

7

ﬁg. 4, we give an example of the increase-increase case, i.e., the amplitudes of both two solitary waves
have exponential increase as t → +∞, and the amplitude below zero increases faster than the one
above zero. During the interaction, both two solitary waves have a shift of the phase respectively
and no changes in speed. In the case of αj = βj, i.e., ¯kj = k∗
j , (j = 1, 2), the solution is a usual
2-soliton solution to nonlocal mKdV equation (3) as well as to mKdV equation. For the case of
(α1 − α2)(β1 − β2) < 0, the solution always has singularity at some sites.
Case 3. Breather solution
2, where k1 and ¯k1 are denoted by k1 = η1 + iζ1 and
Let us consider the case of k1 = −k∗
¯k1 = η2 − iζ2 ( ηj, ζj, j = 1, 2 are positive), and σ1σ2 = −1 and ¯σ1 ¯σ2 = −1. In this case, the solution
has the expression,

vj− = −2ζj[x + 4(3η2

(j = 1, 2).

The solution possesses singularity if η1 6= η2 or ζ1 6= ζ2. But, selecting η1 = η2 = ζ1 = ζ2 in eq.(27)
yields an interesting solution,

q(x, t) = 4µ

sinh(ξ+) sin(ξ−) − cosh(ξ+) cos(ξ−)

cosh2(ξ+) + sin2(ξ−)

,

(28)

where ξ± = −2µ(x ± 8µ2t) with µ > 0. This is a breather solution (see ﬁg. 5).

4 Conclusions and discussions

In this paper, we have investigated the nonlocal mKdV equation through inverse scattering method.
We have given its solutions in the general form. We have presented one-soliton, two-soliton and
breather solutions. The analysis of the properties of these solutions has been given, including the
singularity and long-time behavior. We have demonstrated that these solutions for nonlocal mKdV
equation have some diﬀerent properties from ones of mKdV equation.
[14], Ablowitz and
Musslimani introduced the other two integrable nonlocal equations, complex nonlocal mKdV equa-
tion, and nonlocal sine-Gordon equation. We will give inverse scattering transformations and soliton
solutions for the two new integrable nonlocal equations in the future work.
