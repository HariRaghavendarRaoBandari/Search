Abstract

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has discovered a diﬀuse all-ﬂavor ﬂux of
high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. However, the corresponding astrophys-
ical sources have not yet been identiﬁed. Neither signiﬁcant point sources
nor signiﬁcant angular correlations of event directions have been observed
by IceCube or other instruments to date. We present a new method to inter-
pret the non-observation of angular correlations in terms of exclusions on the
strength and number of point-like neutrino sources in generic astrophysical
scenarios. Additionally, we constrain the presence of these sources taking
into account the measurement of the diﬀuse high-energy neutrino ﬂux by
IceCube. We apply the method to two types of astrophysically motivated
source count distributions: The ﬁrst type is obtained by considering the
cosmological evolution of the co-moving density of active galaxies, while the
second type is directly derived from the gamma ray source count distribution
observed by Fermi-LAT. As a result, we constrain the possible parameter
space for both types of source count distributions.

1. Introduction

1.1. Astrophysical neutrino observation by IceCube

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory [1] at the Geographic South Pole
has discovered an all-sky diﬀuse ﬂux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos [2, 3]
based on neutrinos of all ﬂavors interacting within the detector. However,
no astrophysical sources of this ﬂux could be identiﬁed yet. Recently, this

all-ﬂavor ﬂux has been conﬁrmed by the measurement of an excess of uncon-
tained up-going muons [4] at high energies above the background originating
from interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. These muons are produced by
charged current interactions of muon neutrinos in the ice, where the direc-

tion of the muon and the neutrino agree well within ∼ 1◦ in the considered
energy range. Muons propagate large distances through the ice, and can
be measured with good angular resolution, i.e. < 1◦. Though such events
are ideally suited for the identiﬁcation of the sources, neither searches for
angular autocorrelations of neutrino arrival directions nor correlations of
neutrino arrival directions with the positions of known astrophysical sources
have resulted in a signiﬁcant observation [5, 6].
In conclusion, the total
number of sources of the observed ﬂux is presumably large as so far the
individual sources have been too weak to be detectable with respect to the
atmospheric neutrino background.

1.2. Angular correlations of neutrino arrival directions

This paper focusses on the non-observation of an angular correlation
within 108 310 up-going muons in IceCube data measured from 2008 to 2011
with the detector conﬁgurations IC40, IC59 and IC79 [6]. That result was
obtained based on two analyses. The ﬁrst is a binned correlation analysis
and the second uses the power coeﬃcients of a multipole expansion of the
sky map of detected neutrino arrival directions. In this work, we focus on
the second result. Here, weak sources, constituting the signal, were assumed
to be isotropically distributed over the sky. The signal was benchmarked
according to diﬀerent signal hypotheses, characterized by three quantities:
the total number of sources in the full sky NSou, a universal strength of each
source µ, and the spectral index γ of the energy spectrum. The parameter
µ is the mean number of measured neutrinos per source at the horizon.
While at the horizon the detection eﬃciency is largest, each source oﬀ the
horizon is assigned a lower number of neutrinos according to the declination
dependent detector acceptance.

The analysis from [6] uses a test statistics (TS) that denotes how signif-
icantly the angular correlations of muon directions in the speciﬁc skymap
are distinguishable from the random atmospheric background. The expected
TS shift for signal with respect to the TS expectation for pure atmospheric
background in units of the standard deviation of the background TS is called
signalness Σ in the following. In Figure 1, the TS distributions for signal
hypotheses with diﬀerent values for NSou are shown. The distributions are
obtained by simulations of random skymaps using the information from [6]
about the point spread function and zenith-dependent detector acceptance.

The experimentally observed value is Σexp = −0.3 [6]. The correspond-
ing exclusion limits on the number of sources NSou = NSou,lim for diﬀerent
values of µ are obtained from simulations as those values of NSou for which
90% of experiments would result in a larger signalness than the observed
Σexp. We ﬁnd that for all diﬀerent combinations of NSou and µ this results
in the same signalness Σ, while the variance of the TS distribution is identi-
cal. Correspondingly, the median signalness corresponding to the observed
upper limit is Σlim = 1.07 and does not depend on the speciﬁc choice of

source strength µ.

1.3. Purpose of this work

Purpose of this work is to re-interpret the given exclusion limits for the
number of sources of a ﬁxed source strength in terms of astrophysically mo-
tivated distributions of source strengths dNSou
dµ . To do this, we calculate the
expected signalness as a function of the respective astrophysical model pa-
rameters and compare this to the experimentally excluded signalness. For
this, we make use of the dependencies of the signalness on the model pa-
rameters NSou and µ as introduced above. As benchmark scenarios, we
use two astrophysical models. For the ﬁrst model, we assume isotropically
distributed sources with a number density following the red-shift dependent
evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For the second model, we assume
an isotropic distribution of sources, with strengths following the strengths
of sources of high-energy photons as observed by the Fermi-LAT satellite.

For the normalization of the total astrophysical neutrino ﬂux from all
sources we refer to the measurement of the diﬀuse astrophysical muon neu-
trino ﬂux in the Northern hemisphere [4]. For each above model, we test two

astrophysical neutrino energy spectra ∝ E−γ that are compatible with this

index of γ = 2.5.

2. Method

2.1. Calculation of the source count distributions

2.1.1. Cosmologically distributed sources

For the application to sources motivated by the cosmological evolution
of AGN, we assume standard sources that exhibit the same muon neutrino
luminosity L in the energy range from 100 GeV to 100 TeV used in the Ice-
Cube angular correlation analysis. Due to red-shift of energy this leads to a
red-shift dependency of the energy range that is used for the luminosity nor-
malization. Using L, the source strength µ can be expressed in dependence
on the cosmological redshift z:

AIC
eﬀ (E) is the declination-averaged eﬀective area of each conﬁguration IC.
The factor f (γ) is the declination-averaged detector acceptance divided by
the detector acceptance at the horizon.
It compensates the usage of the
declination-averaged eﬀective area AIC
eﬀ in order to obtain the expected num-
ber of neutrinos per source at the horizon µ instead of a declination-averaged
expected number of neutrinos per source. The values for f (γ) are 0.624 and
0.848 for energy spectra with γ = 2.0 and γ = 2.5, respectively.

The luminosity distance dL(z) and the co-moving volume Vc(z), are cal-
culated using the cosmology calculator described in [7]. For this, the fol-
lowing cosmological parameter values are assumed [8]: Ωm = 0.315+0.016
−0.017,
Ωr = 8.53 · 10−5 and ΩΛ = 0.685+0.017
−0.016. The given errors are propagated for
a cross check: The resulting relative errors for the total number of measured
neutrinos n(scd) and the signalness Σ are ∼ 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively.

by the yellow wide line in Figure 4. The redshift of the closest known AGN in

2.1.2. Fermi-LAT extragalactic sources

The gamma ray telescope Fermi-LAT has measured the photon ﬂux of ex-
tragalactic high-energy photon sources with a ﬁtted average energy spectrum
of E−2.4 in the energy range from 100 MeV to 100 GeV in a high-latitude
survey [13]. It is parametrized by a broken power law:

shown.

As these photon sources are also candidates for high-energy neutrino
sources [14], we adopt the parametrization as a neutrino source count dis-
tribution as explained in the following.

The photon ﬂuxes S and Sb are replaced by the neutrino source strength
µ as deﬁned in Section 1 and the source strength at the break is denoted µb.
The normalization A is replaced by the dimensionless factor B. Hence, all
neutrino source count distribution parameters are dimensionless in contrast

to the parameters measured by Fermi-LAT. Furthermore, a cutoﬀ is intro-
duced by setting the source count distribution to zero for all source strengths
above a maximum µmax to avoid divergences in the signalness calculation.
The cutoﬀ is ﬁxed to µmax = 20µb corresponding to the brightest source in
the Fermi-LAT sample which has a ﬂux of Smax ≈ 20Sb [13]. This results in
the following parametrization for the neutrino source count distribution:

The best-ﬁt values for the powers of the Fermi-LAT source count distri-
bution, β1 = 2.49 and β2 = 1.58, are initially also applied for the neutrino
source count distributions before we study more general values in Section 4.3.
Though motivated by the Fermi-LAT observations, there is no a-priori
correct conversion between the parameters describing the neutrino and pho-
ton source distributions, (µb, B) and (Sb, A).
In particular, the sensitive
energy ranges for the Fermi-LAT high-latitude survey, 100 MeV–100 GeV,
and for the IceCube measurement, 100 GeV–100 TeV, diﬀer. However, as
a benchmark we assume a universal neutrino-to-photon ratio εν/γ for the

all sources of the given population.

Diﬀerent values of εν/γ scale the neutrino ﬂux per source by the same
factor for each source. Thus, they also scale the source strength µ of each
source by the same factor εν/γ and the source count distribution can still be
parametrized by the broken power law given in Equation (6).

To relate the universal neutrino-to-photon ratio to the source count dis-
tribution parametrization from Fermi-LAT, ﬁrst the values of (µb, B) for
εν/γ = 1 are determined which are called (µb,Fermi, BFermi) in the following.
They are calculated by:

BFermi =(cid:0)a(γ) · 10001−γ(cid:1)β1−1

where a(γ) is the factor converting a particle ﬂux into the observed source
strength µ. The factors of 10001−γ in Equations (7) and (8) take into ac-
count the diﬀerent energy ranges of Fermi-LAT and IceCube for the assumed
energy spectra.

For each value of εν/γ (cid:54)= 1, the source strength µ of each source in the
population with B = BFermi and µb = µb,Fermi has to be multiplied by εν/γ.
For the source count distribution parameters B and µb, this leads to:

(10)

Note that we do not explicitly assume any absorption eﬀects for the
photons observed by Fermi-LAT with respect to the neutrinos observed by
IceCube. However, this issue is implicitly addressed in Section 4.3 where
variations in β1 and β2 can partly account for corresponding eﬀects.

2.2. Limit conversion

For the interpretation of the limits from the angular correlation analysis
two quantities are equated: the signalness corresponding to the limit from
the angular correlation analysis and the signalness of the source population
of interest, given on the right hand side of Equation (11):

The signalness of the source population is the integral of the signalness per
source
(µ) as function of the source strength µ weighted with the source
count distribution dNSou
dµ (µ). Solving Equation (11) for parameters of an
assumed source count distribution results in limits on these parameters based
on the non-observation of angular correlations. Note that a methodically
similar analysis of gamma ray sources measured with Fermi-LAT is presented
in [15].

The above conversion is based on the following reasoning. We assume
that the positions of sources in the sky are not correlated on the scale of
the angular resolution of (cid:46) 1◦ and contribute independently to the observed
signalness. This results in a linear dependence of the total signalness on
the number of sources. As intuitively expected for an auto-correlation, the
dependency of the signalness per source on the source strength is non-linear
and follows a power law with a power index of 2. Both dependencies have
been veriﬁed by simulations as discussed in Section 1.

2.3. Astrophysical ﬂux normalization

The total normalization of the up-going diﬀuse astrophysical muon neu-
trino ﬂux has been measured by IceCube [4], and can be used to additionally
constrain the parameters of a source count distribution. For this, the total
number of measured signal neutrinos expected from the source count dis-
tribution n(scd) and the corresponding number expected from the observed
ﬂux n(astro) are equated:

where dΦ

Cube. The parameter values solving Equation (12) represent maximum as-
trophysical scenarios that are consistent with the observation, i.e. assuming
no other sources contributing to the observed ﬂux.

3. Application to isotropic generic sources

In this section, the source count distribution parametrization from Sec-
tion 2.1.1 is used to solve Equations (11) and (12) for (L, α) for both consid-
ered energy spectra. The solutions of Equation (11) are functions α(L) rep-
resenting the converted upper limits on these parameters. They are shown
as colored dashed lines in Figure 7.

The values for L at the intersections between the lines of equal colors
in Figure 7 are the upper limits on the muon neutrino luminosity L under
the condition that the considered source populations produce the diﬀuse
astrophysical neutrino ﬂux. Therefore, all larger values for L are excluded
under this condition. However, for the co-moving densities, represented by
the scale factor α, this is not the case: The values for α at the intersections
can be exceeded under the condition that the luminosity L of each source is
lower than at the intersections. This is further discussed in Section 5.1.

As introduced, a certain value of α can be interpreted as a fraction of

4. Application to Fermi-LAT extragalactic sources

In the following, the angular correlation limit and the astrophysical ﬂux
normalization are interpreted in terms of the Fermi-LAT source count dis-
tribution parameters. Then, values for a universal neutrino-to-photon ratio
εν/γ corresponding to the upper limit and the astrophysical ﬂux normal-
ization are determined. As a last step, we also determine values for εν/γ
corresponding to the upper limit and the astrophysical ﬂux normalization
while varying the source count distribution parameters β1 and β2. By this,
we constrain the possible values that β1 and β2 might have for neutrinos.

from the increased signalness for larger µb (see Equation (11)) due to a
corresponding larger non-zero integration range. This increased signalness
is compensated by lower values for B, causing the negative slope.

The astrophysical ﬂux solutions for both neutrino energy spectra are
shown as solid colored lines in Figure 8. They diﬀer because the eﬀective
area and the ﬂux normalization in Equation (12) are energy dependent [6, 4].
Their intersections with the dashed limit lines (of the respective energy
spectrum) separate the allowed region (below) from the excluded region
(above) of parameter values. This means, a source population with larger
values of B or µb cannot produce the observed ﬂux of astrophysical muon
neutrinos due to the absence of angular correlations associated with them.

4.2. The Fermi-LAT best-ﬁt value and the neutrino-to-photon ratio

The solution (µb,Fermi, Bfermi), corresponding to the special case of εν/γ =
1, is determined according to Equations (7) and (8).
It is shown as an
asterisk in Figure 8 for each energy spectrum. All solutions for pairs of
(µb, B) that correspond to diﬀerent universal values εν/γ (cid:54)= 1 are determined
by Equation (10) and result in the black line shown in Figure 8.
The intersections of the (dashed) limit lines and the (solid colored) lines
representing the observed astrophysical neutrino ﬂux with the black line in
Figure 8 yield values for εν/γ corresponding to the angular correlation limit
and the diﬀuse astrophysical ﬂux for both energy spectra in this simpliﬁed
model. These can be read oﬀ by considering that εν/γ = µb
according
to Equation (10). By reading oﬀ the values of µb at these intersections
(triangles and diamonds in Figure 8) and µb,Fermi (asterisks in Figure 8),
one thus obtains the values for εν/γ. These are given in Table 1.

The used source count distribution parametrization (Equation (6)) can
be generalized by varying the powers β1 and β2 and repeating the procedure
from Sections 4.1 and 4.2.

γ = 2.5. Finally, the ratios between the εν/γ astrophysical ﬂux value and
the εν/γ upper limit are shown in Figure 9e and 9f. Ratios larger than 1
indicate that the astrophysical neutrino ﬂux is excluded to originate purely
from the corresponding source population with 90 % C.L. based on the non-
observation of angular correlations and assuming a universal εν/γ in the
considered energy ranges.

5. Conclusions

5.1. Angular correlations from generic AGN-type sources

large muon neutrino luminosities of the sources above L (cid:39) 6· 1045 erg

The discussion of results from Section 3 is based on Figure 7. The angu-
lar correlation analysis constrains the allowed parameter space to the region
below the dashed lines. However, also the observed diﬀuse astrophysical neu-
trino ﬂux reﬂects an upper limit on the maximum allowed contribution by
these sources and also parameter regions above the solid lines are excluded.
For a spectral index of γ = 2.0, the constraints by the non-observation
of angular correlations are weaker than the observed ﬂux except for very
in the
considered energy range. For such sources, an angular correlation should
have been observed and the fraction α of these sources to the total population
of AGN is constrained. The fraction α would be at least a factor 20 smaller
than the estimated fraction of blazars. For source luminosities well below
1045 erg
s , where the population fraction of blazars coincides with the observed
ﬂux, the angular correlation analysis does not provide additional constraints.
The situation is diﬀerent for γ = 2.5. Here, the non-observation of
s stronger than
the constraint by the ﬂux normalization does. The allowed parameter region
would include an AGN fraction corresponding to the estimation for blazars,
if their muon neutrino luminosity would reach such large values. Obviously,
an improved exposure could allow to positively detect such sources. On
the other hand the angular correlation analysis excludes that blazars are
fully responsible for the observed ﬂux as the required source luminosities

angular correlations excludes luminosities above L (cid:39) 2·1045 erg

s

L (cid:39) 3 · 1045 erg

s are excluded.

These conclusions depend on idealized assumptions. In particular the
ﬁxed source luminosity L is unrealistic. Extended investigations could as-
sume more realistic luminosity distributions or varying neutrino production
eﬃciencies. They would, however, involve more model parameters. Our val-
ues L are to be considered as the ‘eﬀective’ L of a population, averaging the
distribution L(z) and integrating over the luminosity density dn
dL . However,

17

the simpliﬁed analysis that is presented here demonstrates how powerful
astrophysical scenarios can be constrained by the combination of angular
correlations and the observed ﬂux normalization.

5.2. Angular correlations from Fermi-LAT extragalactic sources

Unlike the modelling of generic AGN-type sources, the result here is
based on an empirically observed source count distribution motivated by
the observation of high-energy gamma sources by Fermi-LAT. Therefore, the
interpretation requires the assumption of a neutrino-to-photon ratio εν/γ. In
order to simplify the interpretation we assume this ratio to be universal for
all sources.

Starting with the results in Figure 8 and Table 1 we see that for hard
spectrum sources with γ = 2.0, the observed astrophysical neutrino ﬂux
corresponds to a lower εν/γ value than the εν/γ limit from the correlation
analysis. Hence, for this energy spectrum, the sources from the Fermi-LAT
high-latitude survey are not excluded to be the origin of the astrophysical
neutrino ﬂux under the stated assumptions. Furthermore, the ﬂux normal-
ization results in a required neutrino-to-photon ratio close to the generic
value of εν/γ (cid:39) 1. An improved sensitivity of about a factor 3 for the cor-
relation analysis is required to to test this value. This seems well feasible
with future data of IceCube.

For a softer spectrum with γ = 2.5, the opposite is the case: The re-
quired value εν/γ for the astrophysical ﬂux normalization is excluded by
the εν/γ limit from not observing angular correlations. This means that
the astrophysical ﬂux is excluded to be produced exclusively by sources dis-
tributed according to the Fermi-LAT motivated source count distribution
parametrization for this spectrum. Furthermore, those sources would need
to have neutrino-to-photon ratios of (cid:39) 40. Thus, besides their apparent
absence, such high ratios would also need to be explained theoretically.
We note that the assumption of a universal εν/γ ≈ 1 is not a robust
assumption and is considered as a benchmark, only. The initial value εν/γ
strongly depends on the speciﬁc hadronic production mechanism, the den-
sity of the medium, as well as energy losses or acceleration of intermediate
particles [17, 18, 19]. Then, depending on the optical depth of the sources,
absorption of photons would lead to larger ratios [17]. However, during prop-
agation the muon neutrino ﬂux is also modiﬁed due to oscillations to other
ﬂavors (see e.g. [20]). In case of Fermi-Lat, the determined ratio depends on
observations at largely diﬀerent energy scales. It is questionable whether all
sources that contribute to the Fermi-LAT source count distribution are ac-
tually dominated by photons from hadronic interactions. A strong leptonic

18

contribution could result in substantially smaller εν/γ values. As another
eﬀect, the absorption of photons during propagation is weak for the Fermi-
LAT energy range aﬀecting only the most distant sources. For the limits
from the angular correlation analysis, this eﬀect can be neglected as these
are dominantly aﬀected by the closest bright sources. Still, it would modify
the total ﬂux normalization and hence, for a ﬁxed ﬂux normalization, the
exclusion power with respect to Fermi-LAT would be reduced. However, the
obtained results provide constraints of the properties of astrophysical neu-
trino sources under these simpliﬁed assumptions. By including the eﬀects
discussed above, one can modify the results in order to obtain more speciﬁc
constraints in terms of astrophysical source properties. For such speciﬁc
modelling, the methods introduced in this work are still applicable in the
same way.

Motivated by these systematic uncertainties, the studies of variations of
β1 and β2 (s. Equations (5) and (6)) reveal several insights: First, β1 plays
a strong role for both, the εν/γ astrophysical ﬂux value and the εν/γ limit
because the source count distribution depends strongly on β1 for all source
strengths µ. Second, the εν/γ limit is almost independent of β2 while the
εν/γ astrophysical ﬂux value noticeably depends on β2. This is obvious as β2
only aﬀects the source count distribution dNSou
for source strengths below
dµ
the break µb (s. Equation (6)), i.e. ‘weak’ sources.

The quantities used for the εν/γ limit and the εν/γ astrophysical ﬂux
value are the signalness Σ and the number of neutrinos n(scd) from the tested
source count distribution. This leads to the conclusion that the sources
brighter than µb, i.e. ‘strong’ sources, are the signalness dominating sources
while weak sources aﬀect only n(scd) and not the signalness Σ. This is
a direct consequence of the deﬁnitions of n(scd) (Equation (12)) and Σ
(Equation (11)) which depend on diﬀerent powers of the source strength µ.
A ratio between a value for εν/γ and the εν/γ limit larger than 1 is
excluded with 90 % C.L. Thus, for both energy spectra, the areas to the
bottom left from the black lines in Figures 9e and 9f are excluded. For
γ = 2.5, where the hypothesis with the benchmark values for β1 and β2 is
excluded, its uncertainty interval reaches into the allowed region.

6. Summary

We have developed a method to interpret the results from analyses of
angular correlations in IceCube muon neutrino data in terms of astrophys-
ical scenarios. In addition, the observed astrophysical neutrino ﬂux can be
introduced as a boundary condition. We have shown that already with early

19

data from the partly installed IceCube detector astrophysical scenarios can
be constrained. This is especially the case for soft energy spectra. We expect
a substantially improved sensitivity once results for the angular correlation
with the full IceCube detector become available.
