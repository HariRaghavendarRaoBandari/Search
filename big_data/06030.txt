Abstract

Given a ﬁnite commutative semigroup S (written additively), denoted by D(S) the
Davenport constant of S, namely the least positive integer ℓ such that for any ℓ elements
s1, . . . , sℓ ∈ S there exists a set I ( [1, ℓ] for which Pi∈I si = Pℓ

Then, for any integers r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1, let R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr be the direct sum of
these r residue class rings Zn1, . . . , Znr. Moreover, let SR be the multiplicative semigroup
of the ring R, and U(SR) the group of units of SR. In this paper, we prove that

i=1 si.

D(U(SR)) + P2 ≤ D(SR) ≤ D(U(SR)) + δ,

where P2 = ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 k ni} and δ = ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 | ni}. This corrects our previous
published wrong result on this problem.

1 Introduction

The Davenport constant of any ﬁnite abelian group G, denoted D(G), is the smallest positive
integer ℓ such that, every sequence T of elements in G of length at least ℓ contains a nonempty
subsequence T ′ with the sum of all terms of T ′ equaling the identity element of G. Though

attributed to H. Davenport who proposed the study of this constant in 1965, K. Rogers [3] in
1963 pioneered the investigation of a combinatorial invariant associated with an arbitrary ﬁnite
abelian group G. The Davenport constant is a central concept of zero-sum theory and has been
investigated by many researchers in the scope of ﬁnite abelian groups.

In 2008, the two authors of this manuscript formulated the deﬁnition of the Davenport
constant of ﬁnite commutative semigroups. Subsequently, some related additive results are
obtained in the setting of semigroups (see [1, 4–6, 8, 9]).

Deﬁnition A. ([7]) Let S be a ﬁnite commutativesemigroup. Let T be a sequence of terms
from the semigroup S. We call T reducible if T contains a proper subsequence T ′ (T ′ , T)
such that the sum of all terms of T ′ equals the sum of all terms of T. Deﬁne the Davenport
constantofthesemigroup S,denotedD(S),tobethesmallestℓ ∈ N suchthateverysequence
T oflengthatleastℓ ofelementsin S isreducible.

In 2006, A. Geroldinger and F. Halter-Koch had introduced another combinatorial invari-
ant, which they denoted by d(S), (see Deﬁnition 2.8.12 in [2]), and now is called the small
Davenport constant of S after [1]; this is closely related to the Davenport constant of S, as it is
known from Proposition 1.2 in [1] that D(S) = d(S) + 1 for any ﬁnite commutative semigroup
S.

It is embarrass that the following obtained result on the Davenport constant of ﬁnite com-

mutative semigroups was observed to be incorrect when the ring R is even in some cases.

Theorem B. ([7]) For integers r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1, let R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr. Let SR be the
multiplicativesemigroupoftheringR andU(SR) bethegroupofunitsof SR. Then

D(SR) = D(U(SR)) + P2,

where P2 = ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 k ni}.

It is high time to correct this mistake. In this paper, we shall prove the following result by

employing a diﬀerent method with the previous one used in [7].

Theorem 1.1. For integers r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1, let R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr. Let SR be the
multiplicative semigroup of the ring R and U(SR) be the group of units of SR. Then

D(U(SR)) + P2 ≤ D(SR) ≤ D(U(SR)) + δ,

where P2 = ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 k ni} and δ = ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 | ni}.

2 The preliminaries

• In the rest of this manuscript, we shall always admit that S is a unitary ﬁnite commutative
semigroup.

The operation on S is denoted by +. The identity element of S, denoted 0S, is the unique
element e of S such that e+a = a for every a ∈ S. Let U(S) = {a ∈ S : a+a′ = 0S for some a′ ∈
S} be the group of units of S. For any element c ∈ S, let

St(c) = {a ∈ U(S) : a + c = c}

denote the stabilizer of c in the group U(S). Green’s preorder on the semigroup S, denoted
≦H, is deﬁned by

a ≦H b ⇔ a = b or a = b + c for some c ∈ S.

Green’s congruence on S, denoted H, is deﬁned by:

a H b ⇔ a ≦H b and b ≦H a.

We write a <H b to mean that a ≦H b but a H b does not hold.

A sequence T of S is denoted by T = a1a2 · · · aℓ = `a∈S

a[va(T )], where [va(T )] means that
the element a occurs va(T ) times in the sequence T . By · we denote the operation to join
va(T ) = ℓ. Let T1, T2
sequences. By |T | we denote the length of the sequence, i.e., |T | = Pa∈S
be two sequences of S. We call T2 a subsequence of T1 if va(T2) ≤ va(T1) for every element
a ∈ S, denoted by T2 | T1. In particular, if T2 , T1, we call T2 a proper subsequence of
T1, and write T3 = T1T [−1]
to mean the unique subsequence of T1 with T2 · T3 = T1. Let ε
be the empty sequence. In particular, the empty sequence ε is a proper subsequence of any
nonempty sequence. If T is a nonempty sequence, then we let σ(T ) = Pa∈S
[va(T )]a. We also
deﬁne σ(ε) = 0S. We say that T is reducible if σ(T ′) = σ(T ) for some proper subsequence T ′
of T .

In what follows, we denote

R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr

where r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1 are integers, and denote SR to be the multiplicative semigroup of
the ring R. For any element a ∈ SR, we denote θa = (a1, . . . , ar) ∈ [1, n1] × · · · × [1, nr] be
the unique r-tuple of integers such that (a1, . . . , ar) is the corresponding form of the element
a in the ring R. Let κi(θa) = ai where i ∈ [1, r]. We remark that, since the operation of the
semigroup SR is always denoted by +, for any elements a, b and c of SR, a + b = c holds in SR
if and only if κi(θa) ∗ κi(θb) ≡ κi(θc) (mod ni)

for all i = 1, 2, . . . , r.

Here, the following two lemmas are necessary.

Lemma 2.1. ([2], Lemma 6.1.3) Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group, and let H be a subgroup of
G. Then, D(G) ≥ D(G/H) + D(H) − 1.

• For any prime p and any integer n , 0, let potp(n) be largest integer k such that pk divides n.

Lemma 2.2. Let a and b be two elements of SR. Then the following conclusions hold:

(i) If a ≦H b, then gcd(κi(θb), ni) | gcd(κi(θa), ni) for each i ∈ [1, r], and St(b) ⊆ St(a);

(ii) a H b if and only if gcd(κi(θb), ni) = gcd(κi(θa), ni) for each i ∈ [1, r];

(iii) Suppose a <H b. If there exists some index t ∈ [1, r] such that

potp(gcd(κt(θb), nt)) < potp(gcd(κt(θa), nt))

for some prime p > 2, or

pot2(gcd(κt(θb), nt)) < pot2(gcd(κt(θa), nt)) < pot2(nt),

then St(b) ( St(a).

Proof. (i) Note that a ≦H b implies a = b + c for some c ∈ SR since SR is unitary, and
equivalently, κi(θa) ≡ κi(θb) ∗ κi(θc) (mod ni) for each i ∈ [1, r]. Then Conclusion (i) follows
from a routine veriﬁcation.

(ii) Assume gcd(κi(θb), ni) = gcd(κi(θa), ni) for each i ∈ [1, r]. It follows that there exist
i ≡ κi(θa) (mod ni),
i ∈ [0, ni −1] such that κi(θa) ∗ ci ≡ κi(θb) (mod ni) and κi(θb) ∗ c′
integers ci, c′
where i ∈ [1, r]. Take elements c, c′ ∈ SR such that κi(θc) = ci and κi(θc′) = c′
i for each i ∈ [1, r].
It follows that a + c = b and b + c′ = a, and so a H b. While, the converse follows from
Conclusion (i) immediately.

(iii) Let q be the largest prime with

potq(gcd(κt(θb), nt)) < potq(gcd(κt(θa), nt)).

Let

Take an element d ∈ SR with

α = potq(gcd(κt(θa), nt)).

κi(θd) = 1 for each i ∈ [1, r] \ {t},

Then we have the following.

Assertion A. d ∈ U(SR).

Proof of Assertion A. By (3), it suﬃces to establish that gcd(κt(θd), nt) = 1.

If q =
qα + 1 (mod nt), and so gcd(κt(θd), nt) = 1 follows from the hypothesis,

2, then κt(θd) ≡ nt
pot2(gcd(κt(θb), nt)) < pot2(gcd(κt(θa), nt)) < pot2(nt), immediately. Assume

q > 2.

qα + 1, nt) = 1 or gcd(2 nt

(cid:3)

By (1), (2), (3) and (4), we check that κi(θd) ∗ κi(θa) ≡ κi(θa) (mod ni) for each i ∈ [1, r],
and κt(θd) ∗ κt(θb) . κt(θb) (mod nt). That is, d + a = a and d + b , b. Combined with Assertion
A, we have that d ∈ St(a) \ St(b) proved. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.

3 The proof of Theorem 1.1

ProofofTheorem1.1. We ﬁrst prove that D(SR) ≥ D(U(SR)) + P2. Assume without loss of
generality that

{i ∈ [1, r] : 2 k ni} = [1, P2].

Take an irreducible sequence A of terms from U(SR) of length D(U(SR)) − 1. Let

B = A ·

(5)

where θbi = (1, . . . , 1, 2, 1 . . . , 1) with 2 appears at the i-th location for each i ∈ [1, P2]. Now
we show that B is an irreducible sequence. Suppose to the contrary that B contains a proper
subsequence B′ with

σ(B′) = σ(B).

(6)

Since σ(B′) H σ(B), it follows from Lemma 2.2 (ii) that

P2

`i=1

bi | B′, say

B′ = A′ ·

P2

a

i=1

bi

where A′ is a proper subsequence of A. By (5), (6) and (7), we derive that

2κi(θσ(A′)) ≡ 2κi(θσ(A))

(mod ni) for each i ∈ [1, P2]

and

κ j(θσ(A′)) ≡ κ j(θσ(A))

(mod n j) for each j ∈ [P2 + 1, r].

(7)

(8)

(9)

Since κi(θσ(A′)) and κi(θσ(A)) are odd, it follows from (8) that κi(θσ(A′)) ≡ κi(θσ(A)) (mod ni),
where i ∈ [1, P2]. Combined with (9), we have that σ(A′) = σ(A), which is a contradiction.
This proves that B is irreducible, and so D(SR) ≥ |B| + 1 = D(U(SR)) + P2. Now it remains to
show that D(SR) ≤ D(U(SR)) + δ.

Let T = a1 · a2 · · · aℓ be an arbitrary sequence of term from the semigroup SR of length ℓ =
D(U(SR)) + δ. It suﬃces to show that T contains a propersubsequence T ′ with σ(T ′) = σ(T ).
Take a shortest subsequence V of T such that

σ(V) H σ(T ).

(10)

We may assume without loss of generality that

V = a1 · a2 · · · at where t ∈ [0, ℓ].

If t = 0, i.e., V = ε, then σ(V) = 0SR, which implies that σ(T ) ∈ U(SR) by (10). It follows that
T is a sequence of terms from the group U(SR) and of length |T | = D(U(SR)) + δ ≥ D(U(SR)),
and thus, T is reducible, we are done. Hence, we assume that

By the minimality of |V|, we derive that

t > 0.

Recall that an empty sum of elements of SR is taken equal to 0SR. Denote Ki = St(

Lemma 2.2 (i), we have that

Moreover, we have the following.

Assertion B. There exists a subset M ⊆ [0, t−1] with |M| ≥ t−δ such that Ki ( Ki+1 for each i ∈
M.

Proof of Assertion B. Let v ∈ [0, t − 1] be an arbitrary index with Kv = Kv+1. We shall
ai. Since a <H b, it follows from Lemma 2.2

apply Lemma 2.2 by taking a =
that gcd(κ j(θb), n j) | gcd(κ j(θa), n j) for each j ∈ [1, r], and moveover,

ai and b =

pot2(gcd(κw(θb), nw)) < pot2(gcd(κw(θa), nw)) = pot2(nw)

for some w ∈ [1, r]. By the arbitrariness of v, we have Assertion B proved.

(cid:3)

For each m ∈ M, since U(SR)
Km+1

(cid:27)

U(SR)/Km

and D(Km+1/Km) ≥ 2, it follows from Lemma 2.1

that

D(U(SR)/Km+1) = D( U(SR)/Km
Km+1/Km

)

≤ D(U(SR)/Km) − (D(Km+1/Km) − 1)
≤ D(U(SR)/Km) − 1.

By (12), (13) and Assertion B, we conclude that

1 ≤ D(U(SR)/Kt) ≤ D(U(SR)/K0) − |M|
≤ D(U(SR)) − (t − δ)
= (ℓ − δ) − (t − δ)
= ℓ − t
= |T V [−1]|.

By (10) and Lemma 2.2 (ii), we have

gcd(κi(θσ(V)), ni) = gcd(κi(θσ(T )), ni)

for each i ∈ [1, r]. Let

Pi = {p : p is prime with potp(gcd(κi(θσ(V))), ni) = potp(ni) > 0}

where i ∈ [1, r].

Let a be an arbitrary term of T V [−1]. By (15), we have that for each i ∈ [1, r],

q ∤ κi(θa)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

for any prime divisor q of ni with q < Pi. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can choose
integers ˜ai ∈ [0, ni − 1] such that

˜ai ≡ 1 (mod ppotp(ni))

for any prime p ∈ Pi

(17)

7

and

˜ai ≡ κi(θa)

(mod qpotq(ni))

for any prime divisor q of ni with q < Pi,

(18)

where i ∈ [1, r]. Let ˜a be the element of SR with κi(θ˜a) = ˜ai for each i ∈ [1, r]. By (16), (17)
and (18), we conclude that gcd(κi(θ˜a), ni) = 1 for each i ∈ [1, r], i.e.,

˜a ∈ U(SR).

(19)

By (17) and (18), we conclude that

˜ai ∗ κi(θσ(V)) ≡ 1 · κi(θσ(V)) ≡ 0 ≡ κi(θa) ∗ 0 ≡ κi(θa) ∗ κi(θσ(V))

(mod ppot p(ni))

for any prime p ∈ Pi, and that

˜ai ∗ κi(θσ(V)) ≡ κi(θa) ∗ κi(θσ(V))

(mod qpotq(ni))

for any prime divisor q of ni with q < Pi, that is,

σ(V) + ˜a = σ(V) + a for each term a of T V [−1].

(20)

By (14), (19) and the arbitrariness of the element a above, we see that `a|T V[−1]

˜a is a nonempty

˜a| = |T V [−1]| ≥ D(U(SR)/Kt). It follows that

sequence of terms from U(SR) of length | `a|T V[−1]
there exists a nonemptysubsequence W | T V [−1] such that σ(`a|W

˜a) ∈ Kt which implies

σ(V) + σ(a

˜a) = σ(V).

a|W

(21)

By (20) and (21), we conclude that

σ(T ) = σ(T W[−1]V [−1]) + (σ(V) + σ(W))
= σ(T W[−1]V [−1]) + (σ(V) + σ(`a|W
= σ(T W[−1]V [−1]) + σ(V)
= σ(T W[−1]),

˜a))

and T ′ = T W[−1] is the desired proper subsequence of T . This completes the proof of the
theorem.

We remark that the upper bound in Theorem 1.1 could be reached in some cases. For example,
take

R = Zr1

Note that U(SR) (cid:27) C2r1+r2
is the direct sum of 2r1 + r2 cyclic groups of order two. It is well
known that D(U(SR)) = 2r1 + r2 + 1. For each i ∈ [1, r1 + r2 + r3], we take ai ∈ SR with
θai = (1, . . . , 1, 2, 1 . . . , 1) where the only 2 occurs at the i-th location. It is not hard to check
that the sequence

r1+r2+r3

k=r1+r2+1

T = (

a[3]
i ) · (

r1

r1+r2

a
j=r1+1

is an irreducible sequence in the semigroup SR. It follows that D(SR) ≥ |T | + 1 = 3r1 + 2r2 +
r3 + 1 = D(U(SR)) + r1 + r2 + r3 = D(U(SR)) + δ, and thus,

D(SR) = D(U(SR)) + δ.

However, it would be attractive to determine the precise value of D(SR) − D(U(SR)) when
R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr for any integers r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1. Even, the following conjecture seems
to be interesting.

Conjecture 4.1. For integers r ≥ 1, n1, . . . , nr > 1, let R = Zn1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Znr. Then

D(SR) − D(U(SR)) ≤ ♯{i ∈ [1, r] : pot2(ni) ∈ [1, 3]}.

Erd˝os-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem for ﬁnite commutative semigroups with Prof. Adhikari, the two
authors have noticed such mistake. As ﬁrst, we wish to give a precise result of the Davenport
constant, however, we failed. Recently, more additive research on semigroups have been done,
the authors don’t hesitate to stop this error and to propose the remaining problem.
