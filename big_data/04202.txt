Abstract: In this paper a notion of functional “distance” in the Mellin transform setting
is introduced and a general representation formula is obtained for it. Also, a determination
of the distance is given in terms of Lipschitz classes and Mellin-Sobolev spaces. Finally
applications to approximate versions of certain basic relations valid for Mellin band-limited
functions are studied in details.

Introduction

A Mellin version of the Paley-Wiener theorem of Fourier analysis was introduced
in [5], using both complex and real approaches. Moreover, the structure of the set
of Mellin band-limited functions (i.e.
functions with compactly supported Mellin
transform) was studied.
It turns out that a Mellin band-limited function cannot
at the same time be Fourier band-limited, and it is extendable as an analytic func-
tion to the Riemann surface of the (complex) logarithm. This makes the theory
of Mellin band-limited functions very diﬀerent from the Fourier band-limited ones

1

since one has to extend the notion of the Bernstein spaces in a suitable way, in-
volving Riemann surfaces (Mellin-Bernstein spaces). In the classical frame, Fourier
band-limitedness is a very fundamental assumption in order to obtain certain ba-
sic formulae such as the Shannon sampling theorem, the Mellin reproducing kernel
formula, the Boas diﬀerentiation formula, the Bernstein inequality, quadrature for-
mulae and so on. When a function f is no longer (Fourier) band-limited, certain
approximate versions of the above formulae are available with a remainder which
needs to be estimated in a suitable way. This was done in [14], [15], [16] in terms of
an appropriate notion of “distance” of f from the involved Bernstein space. In the
Mellin transform setting an exponential version of the Shannon sampling theorem
for Mellin band-limited functions was ﬁrst introduced in a formal way in [18], [7]
in order to study problems arising in optical physics. A precise mathematical ver-
sion of the exponential sampling formula, also in the approximate sense, was given
in [10], [11], employing a rigorous Mellin transform analysis, as developed in [8],
[9] (see also [4]). Furthermore, a Mellin version of the reproducing kernel formula,
both for Mellin band-limited funtions and in an approximate sense, was proved in
[2]. Therefore it is quite natural to study estimates of the error in the approximate
versions of the exponential sampling theorem, the reproducing kernel formula, the
Bernstein inequality and the Mellin-Boas diﬀerentiation formula using a new notion
of “Mellin distance” of a function f from a Mellin-Bernstein space. In the present
paper, we introduce a notion of distance in the Mellin frame, and we prove certain
basic representation theorems for it (Sec. 3). In Sec. 4 we give precise evaluations of
the Mellin distance in some fundamental function spaces such as Lipschitz classes
and Mellin-Sobolev spaces. In Sec. 5 we describe some important applications to
the approximate exponential sampling thoerem, the Mellin reproducing kernel the-
orem and the Boas diﬀerentiation formula in the Mellin setting, employing Mellin
derivatives. Moreover, the theory developed here enables one to obtain an inter-
esting approximate version of the Bernstein inequality with an estimation of the
remainder. The present approach may also be employed in order to study other
basic relations valid for Mellin band-limited functions.

2 Notations and preliminary results

Let C(R+) and C({c} × iR) be the spaces of all uniformly continuous and bounded
functions deﬁned on R+ and on the line {c} × iR, c ∈ R, respectively, endowed with
the usual sup-norm k · k∞, and let C0(R+) be the subspace of C(R+) of functions f
satisfying limx→0+ f (x) = limx→+∞ f (x) = 0. For 1 ≤ p < +∞, let Lp = Lp(R+) be
the space of all the Lebesgue measurable and p-integrable complex-valued functions
deﬁned on R+ endowed with the usual norm k · kp. Analogous notations hold for
functions deﬁned on R.

For p = 1 and c ∈ R, let us consider the space

c = {f : R+ → C : f (·)(·)c−1 ∈ L1(R+)}
X 1

endowed with the norm

kfkX 1

More generally, let X p

|f (u)|uc−1du.

c := kf (·)(·)c−1k1 =Z ∞
c denote the space of all functions f : R+ → C such that
c is the space of all
µ(R+) denotes the Lebesgue

µ(R+), where Lp

f (·)(·)c−1/p ∈ Lp(R+) with 1 < p < ∞. In an equivalent form, X p
functions f such that (·)cf (·) ∈ Lp
space with respect to the (invariant) measure µ(A) =RA dt/t for any measurable set
c we will denote the space of all functions f : R+ → C such
A ⊂ R+. Finally, by X ∞
that k(·)f (·)k∞ = supx>0 |xcf (x)| < +∞.
The Mellin transform of a function f ∈ X 1

c is deﬁned by (see e.g. [17], [9])

Mc[f ](s) ≡ [f ]∧

µ = Lp

0

Basic properties of the Mellin transform are the following:

Mc[af + bg](s) = aMc[f ](s) + bMc[g](s)

(f, g ∈ X 1

c , a, b ∈ R),

|Mc[f ](s)| ≤ kfkX 1

c

(s = c + it).

The inverse Mellin transform M −1

where by Lp({c}×iR) for p ≥ 1, will mean the space of all functions g : {c}×iR → C
with g(c + i·) ∈ Lp(R).

For p = 2 the Mellin transform M 2

c is given by (see [11])

M 2

c [f ](s) ≡ [f ]∧

M 2
c

in the sense that

c of f ∈ X 2

= 0.

In this instance, the Mellin transform is norm-preserving in the sense that (see [11])

kgkX 2

c =

MckL2({c}×iR).

More generally, using the Riesz-Thorin convexity theorem, one may introduce a
deﬁnition of Mellin transform in X p

c with p ∈]1, 2[ in an analogous way, i.e.,

M p

c [f ](c + it) −Z ρ

1/ρ

lim

ρ→∞(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

f (u)us−1du(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Lp′ ({c}×iR)

= 0,

where p′ denotes the conjugate exponent of p.

Analogously, the inverse Mellin transform M −1,2

c

is deﬁned as

M −1,2

c

in the sense that

[f ](s) = l. i. m

c

= 0.

In a similar way one can deﬁne the inverse Mellin transform M −1,p

with p ∈ ]1, 2[.
In what follows, we will continue to denote the Mellin transform of a function

c

g ∈ Lp(R+) by [g]∧
by

Mc and we will consider essentially the cases p = 1 and p = 2.

The Mellin translation operator τ c

Setting τh := τ 0

For 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, denote by Bp

c ∩
C(R+), c ∈ R, which are Mellin band-limited to the interval [−σ, σ], σ ∈ R+, thus
for which [f ]∧
Mc(c + it) = 0 for all |t| > σ. We notice that, as in Fourier analysis, the
c,σ ⊂ Bq
inclusion Bp

c,σ the Bernstein space of all functions f ∈ X p

c,σ holds for 1 ≤ p < q ≤ 2.

3 A notion of distance

For q ∈ [1, +∞], let Gq
the representation

c be the linear space of all functions f : R+ → C that have

f (x) =

1

2πZ ∞

−∞

ϕ(v)x−c−ivdv

(x > 0),

where ϕ ∈ L1(R) ∩ Lq(R).

The space Gq

c will be endowed with the norm

[|f|]q := kϕkLq(R) =(cid:18)Z ∞

−∞ |ϕ(v)|qdv(cid:19)1/q

.

4

Note that this is really a norm. Indeed, [|f|]q = 0 iﬀ f = 0 due to the existence and
uniqueness of Mellin inversion (see [9], [11]).

The above norm induces the metric

distq(f, g) := [|f − g|]q

f, g ∈ Gq
c.

Note that in case q = 2 we have

dist2(f, g) = √2πkf − gkX 2

c ,

i.e., our distance reduces to the “Euclidean” distance in X 2
As a consequence of the Mellin inversion formula, functions f for which [f ]∧
L1(R) ∩ Lq(R) belong to Gq
subspace of Gq
function of v ∈ R and so it belongs to any Lq(R).

c since the Mellin transform of f ∈ Bp

c. For p ∈ [1, 2], the Mellin-Bernstein space Bp

Mc(c+i·) ∈
c,σ is a
c,σ has compact support as a

For f ∈ Gq

distq(f, Bp

c,σ) = inf
g∈Bp

c,σ

[|f − g|]q .

The following representation theorem holds:

Theorem 1. For any f ∈ Gq

c, we have

distq(f, Bp

c,σ) =(cid:18)Z|v|≥σ |ϕ(v)|qdv(cid:19)1/q

(1 ≤ q < ∞),

and if ϕ is also continuous, then

dist∞(f, Bp

c,σ) = sup

|v|≥σ |ϕ(v)|.

Proof. Assume q < ∞. Clearly, since g ∈ Bp

c,σ implies |[g]∧

Mc(c + iv)| = 0 for

|v| ≥ σ, one has

distq(f, Bp

c,σ) =(cid:26) inf

g∈Bp

c,σZ|v|≤σ |ϕ(v) − [g]∧

Mc(c + iv)|qdv +Z|v|≥σ |ϕ(v)|qdv(cid:27)1/q

.

Therefore we have to prove that

Ip,q := inf
g∈Bp

c,σZ|v|≤σ |ϕ(v) − [g]∧

Mc(c + iv)|qdv = 0.

For the given σ > 0, the space C ∞
c (] − σ, σ[), whose elements are all the inﬁnitely
diﬀerentiable functions with compact support in ]− σ, σ[, is dense in Lq(]− σ, σ[) for

5

1 ≤ q < ∞ (see e.g. [1]). Thus, given ϕ ∈ Lq(R) and ε > 0, we can take a function
P ∈ C ∞

c (] − σ, σ[) such that

Now we deﬁne

gε(x) :=

(x > 0).

kϕ − PkLq(]−σ,σ[) < ε.
2π Z σ

P (v)x−ivdv

x−c

−σ

Integrating k-times by parts, one can easily see that xcgε(x) = O((log x)−k) for x →
+∞ and x → 0+. This implies that gε ∈ X p
Mc(c + iv) = P (v)
for |v| ≤ σ and 0 otherwise. Thus gε ∈ Bp
p,q ≤ kϕ − [gε]∧
I 1/q

c for any p ≥ 1, and [gε]∧
c,σ. Now we conclude that

Mc(c + i·)kLq(]−σ,σ[)

= kϕ − PkLq(]−σ,σ[) < ε.

Hence the assertion follows for 1 ≤ q < ∞.
The case q = ∞ is treated in a diﬀerent way. To this end, given ε > 0, there exists
a twice continuously diﬀerentiable function ψ on R such that supv∈R |ϕ(v)− ψ(v)| <
ε/2. For example, ψ may be chosen as an appropriate spline function. For η ∈ ]0, σ[,
deﬁne

|v| ≤ σ − η,

if − σ ≤ v ≤ −σ + η,
if σ − η ≤ v ≤ σ,
if

|v| ≥ σ.

Note that ψ1 is continuous on R and

kψ1kL∞(R) = sup

|v|≥σ−η |ψ1(v)| = sup

|v|≥σ |ψ(v)| ≤ sup

|v|≥σ |ϕ(v)| +

.

Next deﬁne ψ0(v) := ψ(v) − ψ1(v) for v ∈ R. Then ψ0 is continuous on R, twice
continuously diﬀerentiable on ] − σ, σ[, it vanishes at ±σ and it has support on
[−σ, σ]. With these properties, two integrations by parts show that

gε(x) :=

x−c

2π Z σ

−σ

ψ0(v)x−ivdv

(x > 0)

deﬁnes a function gε ∈ X p

c ∩ Bp

c,σ. Furthermore, the Mellin inversion formula yields

that [gε]∧

Mc(c + i·) = ψ0(·). Now we conclude that

This implies that dist∞(f, Bp

Hence the formula stated in the theorem holds.

Next we will obtain a distance formula for Mellin derivatives. We deﬁne the ﬁrst

Mellin derivative (the Mellin diﬀerential operator of ﬁrst order) by

(Θ1

cf )(x) := lim

hf (x) − f (x)

h − 1

and the Mellin diﬀerential operator of order r ∈ N is deﬁned iteratively by Θr
c(Θ(r−1)
Θ1
Theorem 2. Let f ∈ Gq
r ∈ N, then f has Mellin derivatives up to order r in C0(R) and

c. If vrϕ(v) belongs to L1(R) as a function of v for some

4 Estimation of the Mellin distance

c,σ and the space Gq

In this section we will introduce certain basic “intermediate” function spaces between
the spaces Bp
c. We will consider mainly the cases p = 1 and p = 2.
In the following for p ∈ [1, 2], we will denote by Mp
c the space comprising all functions
Mc ∈ L1({c} × iR). This space is contained in Gq
f ∈ X p
c for
suitable values of q, namely for q ∈ [1, p′] with p′ being the conjugate exponent of p.
As for the classes Bp
c for 1 ≤ p < q ≤ 2.
We begin with the deﬁnitions of diﬀerences of integer order and an appropriate

c,σ, we have again the inclusion Mp

c ∩ C(R) such that [f ]∧

c ⊂ Mq

modulus of smoothness. For a function f ∈ X p
(−1)r−j(cid:18) r

c , r ∈ N and h > 0, we deﬁne
j (cid:19) f (hju)hjc,

h f )(u) :=

(∆r,c

Xj=0

and for δ > 0,

ωr(f, δ, X p

c ) := sup

In particular for p = 1,

ωr(f, δ, X 1

c ) := sup

| log h|≤δ k∆r,c

h fkX 1

Among the basic properties of the above modulus of smoothness ωr we list the
following three:
1. ωr(f,·, X p

In view of Theorem 1, this implies the assertion for q < ∞. The case q = ∞ is
obtained analogously.

Proof. First we consider the case q = 2. Then

Now let h ≥ 1. For v ∈ [(2 log h)−1, (log h)−1], one has

and hence

Analogously we have

Now, let σ > 0 be ﬁxed, set σk := σ2k with k ∈ N0, and deﬁne h by log h = 1/σk+1.
Then

Zσk≤|v|≤σk+1 |[f ]∧

Mc(c + iv)|2dv ≤ π2r[ωr(f, σ−1

and so summation over k yields

Now since σk+1 − σk = σk, from the monotonicity of ωr as a function of δ, one has

This gives the assertion for q = 2. For q ∈ [1, 2[ one can proceed as in the proof of
Proposition 13 in [15], using Hölder’s inequality.

4.1 Mellin-Lipschitz spaces

For α ∈ ]0, r] we deﬁne the Lipschitz class by

Lipr(α, X p

c ) := {f ∈ X p

c : ωr(f ; δ; X p

c ) = O(δα), δ → 0+}.

As a consequence of Theorems 3 and 4, we obtain the following corollary which
determines the Mellin distance of a function f ∈ Lipr(α, X p
c,σ for p = 1, 2.
Corollary 2. If f ∈ Lipr(α, X 1
then

4.2 Mellin-Sobolev spaces

Denote by ACloc(R+) the space of all locally absolutely continuous functions on R+.
The Mellin-Sobolev space W r,p
c (R+) is deﬁned as the space of all functions f ∈ X p
which are equivalent to a function g ∈ C r−1(R+) with g(r−1) ∈ ACloc(R+) such that

The same result also holds for 1 < p ≤ 2, taking into account the general convolution
theorem for Mellin transforms ([11, Lemma 3.1] in case p = 2, [12, Lemma 2]).
c (R+) can be characterized as
Mc(c + iv), g ∈ Lp({c} × iR)}.

c : (−iv)r[f ]∧

Mc(c + iv) = [g]∧

W r,p
c (R+) = {f ∈ X p
We have the following
Theorem 5. Let f ∈ M1

q = ∞,

where D′ is again a constant depending on r and q only.

Proof. First we consider the case q < ∞. The formula for the Mellin transform

of a Mellin derivative yields

[f ]∧

Mc(c + iv) = (−iv)−r[Θr

Thus, from Theorem 1 we obtain

Mc(c + iv)|qdv(cid:27)1/q

Since Θr

and hence the assertion for q < ∞ is proved with D = (2/(rq − 1))1/q. For q = ∞
we use again Theorem 1 and proceed analogously, obtaining D = 1. For the second

Proof. As in the previous theorem, by the formula of Mellin transform in X 2

distq(f, B2

c,σ) =(cid:26)Z|v|≥σ |v−r[Θr

For q = 2, using the property that the Mellin transform in X 2

Therefore the assertion follows for q = 2 with the constant D = (2π)−1/2. For

The second inequality follows by arguments similar to those in the proof of Theo-
rem 5.
(cid:3)

As a consequence, under the assumptions of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 6, we can

obtain an asymptotic estimate of the form

distq(f, B2

c,σ) = O(σ−r−1/2+1/q)

(σ → +∞).

5 Applications

In this section we will illustrate applications to various basic formulae such as the
approximate exponential sampling theorem, the approximate reproducing kernel
formula in the Mellin frame (see [10], [2]), a generalized Boas diﬀerentiation formula
and an extension of a Bernstein-type inequality.

In the following for c ∈ R, we denote by linc the function

linc(x) :=

x−c

xπi − x−πi

log x

=

x−c

2π Z π

−π

x−itdt

(x > 0, x 6= 1)

with the continuous extension linc(1) = 1. Thus

linc(x) = x−csinc(log x)

(x > 0).

Here, as usual, the “sinc” function is deﬁned as

sinc(t) :=

sin(πt)

πt

for t 6= 0,

sinc(0) = 1.

It is clear that linc 6∈ Xc for any c. However, it belongs to the space X 2

c and its

5.1 Approximate exponential sampling formula
For a function f ∈ B2
[11]):

c,πT the following exponential sampling formula holds (see [10],

f (ek/T )linc/T (e−kxT )

(x > 0).

f (x) =Xk∈Z

c we have (see [11, Theorem 5.5]):

(x ∈ R+, T > 0).

This estimate can now be given a “metric interpretation”. By Theorem 1, the

right-hand side may be expressed as

x−c
π

dist1(f, B2

c,πT ).

Hence, introducing a remainder (RπT f )(x) by writing

f (x) = Xk∈Z

f(cid:0)ek/T(cid:1) linc/T (cid:0)e−kxT(cid:1) + (RπT f ) (x),

we have by Proposition 1

(x > 0),

or equivalently,

c ≤

(3)

This relation is a trivial equality when f ∈ B2

c,πT . Indeed, consider the function

when f 6∈ B2

c,πT . But equality can also occur

By a straight forward calculation, we ﬁnd that

f (x) := x−csinc(2T log x − 1).

Furthermore,

f (ek/T ) = e−kc/T sinc(2k − 1) = 0

for all k ∈ Z. Therefore (RπT f )(x) = f (x), which shows that

kRπT fkX∞

c = sup

x>0 |sinc(2T log x − 1)| = 1,

and so equality occurs in (3).

Now, employing Theorem 1, Corollary 2 and the results on Mellin-Sobolev spaces,

one has the following theorem.

Theorem 7. For the remainder of the approximate exponential sampling formula
(2), the following asymptotic estimates hold:

1. If f ∈ Lipr(α, X 1

c ∩ C(R+)), r ∈ N, r ≥ 2, 1 < α ≤ r, then
k(RπT f )kX∞
(T → +∞).

c = O(T −α+1)

2. If f ∈ M2

c = O(T −β+1/2)

5.2 Approximate Mellin reproducing kernel formula

Proof. The proof is essentially the same as in [2, Theorem 6]. Here for the
sake of completeness we give some details. First, note that the convolution integral

5.3 A sampling formula for Mellin derivatives

In the context of Fourier analysis the following diﬀerentiation formula has been
considered:

f ′(x) =

4T

π Xk∈Z

(−1)k+1
(2k − 1)2 f(cid:18)x +

2T (cid:19)
2k − 1

(x ∈ R).

(6)

It holds for all entire functions of exponential type πT which are bounded on the
real line.
In particular, it holds for trigonometric polynomials of degree at most
⌊πT⌋, where ⌊πT⌋ denotes the integral part of πT, and in this case the series on the
right-hand side can be reduced to a ﬁnite sum.
The formula for trigonometric polynomials was discovered by Marcel Riesz [19]
in 1914. Its generalization (6) is due to Boas [6]. Some authors refer to (6) as the
generalized Riesz interpolation formula, others name it after Boas.

Formula (6) has several interesting applications. It provides a very short proof
of Bernstein’s inequality in Lp(R) for all p ∈ [1,∞]. Modiﬁed by introducing a
Gaussian multiplier, it leads to a stable algorithm of high precision for numerical
diﬀerentiation (see [20]). Furthermore, it has been extended to higher order deriva-
tives (see [14], [20]).

The following theorem gives an analogue of (6) for Mellin derivatives.

Theorem 9. For f ∈ B∞
π Xk∈Z

Θcf (x) =

c,πT there holds
(−1)k+1
(2k − 1)2 e(k−1/2)c/T f(cid:0)xe(k−1/2)/T(cid:1)

4T

(x ∈ R+).

(7)

18

Proof. Formula (7) could be deduced from (6) by making use of the relationship
between the Fourier transform and the Mellin transform. In the following we give
an independent proof completely within Mellin analysis.

First assume that, in addition,

xcf (x) = O(cid:18) 1

| log x|(cid:19)

(x → 0+ and x → ∞).

(8)

Then the exponential sampling formula applies to f and yields

f (x) = Xk∈Z

f(cid:0)ek/T(cid:1) linc/T (cid:0)e−kxT(cid:1) .

The series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of R+. When we
apply the diﬀerentiation operator Θc with respect to x, we may interchange it with
the summation on the right-hand side. Thus,

Θcf (x) = Xk∈Z

f(cid:0)ek/T(cid:1) Θclinc/T (cid:0)e−kxT(cid:1) .

By a calculation we ﬁnd that

Θclinc/T (cid:0)e−kxT(cid:1) = T

ekc/T x−c cos(log(e−πkxπT )) − linc/T (e−kxT )

log(e−kxT )

.

The complicated cosine term disappears at x = e1/(2T ). Then (9) becomes

Θcf (e1/(2T )) =

4T

π Xk∈Z

(−1)k+1
(2k − 1)2 e(k−1/2)c/T f(cid:0)ek/T(cid:1) .

(9)

(10)

In order to obtain the Θc derivative of f at x, we consider the function g : t 7→
f (xe−1/(2T )t). It satisﬁes the assumptions used for deducing (10). Now, applying
(10) to g, we arrive at the desired formula (7).

We still have to get rid of the additional assumption (8). If f is any function in

B∞

c,πT , then

fε(x) := f (x1−ε) xcε(T −1)linc(xεT )

belongs to B∞
ε → 0+, we ﬁnd that (7) holds for f as well.

inequality for norms we have

Now, for v ∈ R, consider the function gv : x 7→ ix−iv. We note that gv ∈ B∞
if |v| ≤ πT. Hence gv satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 9 for c = 0 and this
restriction on v. Since Θ0gv(1) = v, we ﬁnd by applying (7) to gv with c = 0 and
x = 1 that ψ(v) = v for v ∈ [−πT, πT ].
Hence ψ is a 4πT -periodic function that is given on the interval [−πt, 3πT ] by

We also note that ψ(v + 2πT ) = −ψ(v) and (consequently) ψ(v + 4πT ) = ψ(v).

ψ(v) =

if − πT ≤ v ≤ πT,
if πT ≤ v ≤ 3πT.

Thus, using the function φ deﬁned in (15), whose graph is shown in Fig. 1, we can
express ψ(v) as πT φ(v/(πT )). Hence (20) implies (14).

Inequalities (16) and (17) are easily obtained by noting that |φ(v)| ≤ 1 for v ∈ R

and by recalling Corollary 1.

5.4 An extension of the Bernstein-type inequality

Just the same way as we deduced (12) from (7), we may use (13) to obtain

kΘcfkX p

c ≤ πTkfkX p

c + kRB

πT fkX p
c .

For p = 2 we can proﬁt from the isometry of the Mellin transform expressed by

the formula

kfkX 2

c =

obtaining the following theorem

√2π(cid:18)ZR |[f ]∧

Theorem 11. Under the assumptions of Theorem 10 we have

c ≤ πTkfkX 2

c +

for any T > 0.

Proof. With f1 deﬁned in (18) and f0 := f − f1, we have

kΘcfkX 2

c ≤ kΘcf0kX 2

c + kΘcf1kX 2

c ≤ πTkf0kX 2

c + kΘcf1kX 2

c

(21)

since (12) applies to f0. We are going to estimate the quantities on the right-hand
side in terms of f . Using the isometry of the Mellin transform, we ﬁnd that
