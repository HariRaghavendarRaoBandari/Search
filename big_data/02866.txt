Abstract

We provide a simple way for calculating the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole from the
entropy of its Hawking radiation. To this end, we show that if a thermodynamic system
loses its energy only through the black body radiation, its loss of entropy is always 3/4 of
the entropy of the emitted radiation. This proposition enables us to relate the entropy of
an evaporating black hole to the entropy of its Hawking radiation. Explicitly, by calculating
the entropy of the Hawking radiation emitted in the full period of evaporation of the black
hole, we ﬁnd the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the initial black hole.

In the early 70’s, based on some thermodynamic analyses, it was shown that black holes
(BHs) possess nonzero entropy [1, 2]. Soon after, in spite of lacking knowledge about the nature
of these probable statistical systems, and by a semi-classical calculation, their temperature was
also calculated [3], which is known as Hawking temperature. The method, which has been
implicitly used for calculation of this temperature, was based on the following idea: instead of
investigating the black hole as a thermodynamic system (for which the underlying statistical
substrate is unknown), we can investigate its black body radiation to ﬁnd its temperature. This
method is somehow similar to ﬁnding the surface temperature of the Sun by measuring the
temperature of the sunshine as its black body radiation.

In spite of these seminal achievements, and after more than four decades since the realization
of BHs as thermodynamic systems, the question about microscopic origin of the BH entropy has
not given a well-established answer. Nonetheless, there have been interesting progresses towards
answering this question, which have employed somehow diﬀerent approaches. The ﬁrst derivation
of BH entropy has been in the context of Euclidean canonical [4] (and later microcanonical [5])
functional formulation for quantum gravity. Another famous approach presented in the subject’s
literature is trying to provide the missing microscopic description by utilizing the string theory
[6]. A diﬀerent approach is studying BHs in the semi-classical regime, while trying to describe
their entropy from the statistics of the quantum ﬁelds residing around them [7]. Parallel to this
line of research, there have been attempts to relate entanglement entropy associated to a subset of
the Hilbert space of these quantum ﬁelds, to the entropy of the background BHs [8–10]. Another
related approach, which is based on calculation of entanglement entropy for some conformal
quantum ﬁelds residing on boundaries of the spacetime, has drawn attentions to the holographic
description for the BH entropy [11,12]. Yet, some recent studies based on building classical (and
hopefully quantum) covariant phase space for (extremal) BHs, have been carried out in order to

the BH horizon with some ﬂuids [17], etc. For a nice overall review see Ref. [18], and for reviews
focusing on some of the approaches mentioned above see Refs. [19–23].

In this paper, we calculate the entropy of a Schwarzschild BH, based on the same method
which Hawking used to calculate the temperature of this BH. For convenience, we use the  =
c = 1. In order to provide intuitions for the reader, we ﬁrst consider an unknown thermodynamic
system, which our knowledge about it is only through its black body radiation. We want to ﬁnd
the temperature and the entropy of such a system. However, ﬁnding the temperature is an easy
job by studying the spectrum of its thermal radiation. On the other hand, ﬁnding the entropy
is composed of two steps: 1) relating the entropy loss of the system and the entropy carried
outside by the radiation 2) ﬁnding the entropy of the black body radiation emitted from the
beginning of the process of radiation till the end of it. The latter would be the state at which
all possible internal energy that the system can radiate is ﬁnished. This can be assumed to be
the state with zero entropy. Therefore, by the second step, we ﬁnd the entropy of the overall
radiation; and then by the ﬁrst step, the initial entropy of the system can be found.

The ﬁrst step of the two above can be taken by considering the proposition below, which
is a general and interesting one, enabling us to relate the entropy loss of a black body to the
entropy of its black body radiation:

Proposition 1. If a thermodynamic system at equilibrium loses its internal energy only through
its black body radiation into the vacuum, then its loss of entropy is (approximately) 3
4 of the
entropy of the emitted radiation3.

Proof. Let us denote the internal energy, temperature, and entropy of our thermodynamic sys-
tem by U , T , and S respectively. Consider that the system loses an inﬁnitesimal amount of
internal energy δU and entropy δS through black body radiation. According to the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics, and by the assumption of the proposition,

δU = T δS .

(1)

On the other hand, we consider the black body radiation emitted in the vicinity of the surface of
the thermodynamic system, (approximately) as a canonical ensemble of photon4 gas at thermal
equilibrium with the system. The internal energy, temperature and entropy of this photon gas
can be denoted by δ ˜U , ˜T , and δ ˜S respectively. By the standard statistical mechanics of photon
gases (see e.g. exercise 23.6 in Ref. [24]), these quantities are related by

δ ˜S =

4
3

δ ˜U
˜T

.

(2)

In the equilibrium, ˜T = T . Moreover, by the conservation of energy δU = −δ ˜U . Putting them
4 δ ˜S. Letting a ﬁnite amount of radiation to be emitted, the
into Eqs. (1) and (2), then δS = −
equilibrium temperature gradually varies; but this relation for the entropy variations remains
always valid. So, denoting the entropy loss of the system during the radiation process by ∆S
and the entropy of the emitted radiation by ∆ ˜S, we will have, by the extensivity of the entropies,

3

∆S = −

∆ ˜S .

3In (1, d) dimensional spacetime, the factor would be d/(d + 1).
4In the proof, the photon gas can be replace by (arbitrary combination of) other bosonic massless gases. It is

because of cancellation of the spin degrees of freedom from both sides of Eq. (2).

In Proposition 1, the factor 4/3 is an approximated factor; there are two issues which one
needs to consider, in order to ﬁnd a more accurate factor; 1) the black body radiation around
the surface of an object has some preferred directions of propagation. Hence, considering it as
a perfect canonical ensemble is an approximation. 2) it has been explicitly assumed that the
radiation propagates into the vacuum, while one can consider an ambient matter. The detailed
analysis considering these two issues has been done in Refs. [25–27]. For clarity, and because of
insensitivity of our upcoming analysis to the factor 4/3, we will not consider these subtle issues.
Now, returning to the BH thermodynamic system, we consider that the process of evapora-
tion of a Schwarzschild BH ﬁts well in the proposition above, if we assume that the propagation
of the Hawking radiation is an adiabatic process. In other words, the entropy of the Hawking
radiation does not change by its propagation towards the inﬁnity. So the ﬁrst step in calculation
of the entropy for our BH is taken.

The second step is to calculate the entropy of the Hawking radiation emitted during the
whole process of evaporation of the BH. Consider a Schwarzschild BH with the initial mass
M0 which evaporates until its mass vanishes. Besides, consider a distant observer who resides
at spatial inﬁnity. The Hawking radiation reaches her at the Hawking temperature which is
related to the remaining mass M of the black hole by TH = 1
8πGM [3]. Therefore, she will receive
the Hawking radiation until the end of the evaporation of the BH, while the temperature of
the radiation raises proportional to the inverse of the remaining mass of the BH. In order to
calculate the entropy of the whole of Hawking radiation, we can ﬁrst calculate the inﬁnitesimal
entropy of radiation within a spherical thin shell concentric with the BH, and passing through
the position of the observer. Then, by adding up the entropy of such shells of radiation, as
time passes from receiving the ﬁrst radiation till the time of receiving the last radiation by the
observer, we can ﬁnd the whole entropy.

In order to ﬁnd the entropy in the thin shell mentioned above, let us study the Hawking
radiation within it. At the time when the Hawking temperature of the radiation within the shell
is some TH, we can use the standard formula for the entropy of a photon gas which is

δ ˜S =

4
3

δ ˜U
TH

,

(4)

in which δ ˜U is the energy of the Hawking radiation inside the shell. One needs to integrate over
all Hawking radiation passing through the shell in the period of time between receiving the ﬁrst
piece of radiation till the last piece of that. This integration can be done by paying attention
to the conservation of energy, δ ˜U = −δM . Therefore, the entropy of the whole of Hawking
radiation emitted during the BH evaporation process is

Using Proposition 1, entropy of the initial BH, being 3/4 of the entropy of the radiation, can be
found to be

of the initial BH. This result is exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the initial BH.

s (with rs = 2GM0 being the Schwarzschild radius) is the area of the horizon

At the end, the following remarks are necessary to be mentioned.

• In Ref. [25], W. H. Zurek had provided almost similar calculations to ﬁnd the entropy of
Hawking radiation emitted from an evaporated BH; he assumes the entropy of BH to be

3

4G . Then, using the Hawking temperature TH = 1

S = A
8πGM , and statistical properties of
photon gases, he ﬁnds the entropy of Hawking radiation to be approximately 4/3 of the
entropy of initial BH. In spite of his splendid work, there is an important thing which he
had not paid enough attention to; this increasing of the entropy via black body radiation
by a factor of 4/3 is true for any thermodynamic system, and is not a peculiar property of
the BHs. This issue has been proved in Proposition 1. Hence, in this context, Zurek’s work
can be considered as a ﬁrm check of the Proposition 1. On the other hand, in our analysis,
we ﬁrst calculated the entropy of Hawking radiation by considering its temperature at
inﬁnity to be TH = 1
8πGM , in addition to applying statistical mechanics of photon gases.
Then, with crucial usage of Proposition 1, we found the entropy of the BH to be S = A
4G .

• One might be skeptical about triviality of the analysis in two aspects. 1) in the analysis,
the factor 4/3 can be replaced by any other nonzero factor. 2) by the Hawking tempera-
ture TH = 1
8πGM and assuming the ﬁrst law to hold for the black hole, one can integrate
the black hole entropy to ﬁnd the ﬁnal result. In the ﬁrst case, in spite of insensitivity of
the result of the analysis to the explicit factor 4/3, our derivation of Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy is nontrivial. It is because of nontriviality of the peculiar temperature of Hawking
radiation, physical steps for calculating the entropy of the whole radiation, and relating it
to the entropy of BH. However, the independence of the analysis from the speciﬁc choice
of this factor is a positive aspect of the analysis; it makes the analysis to be applicable
when one goes beyond the approximation of canonical photon emission into the vacuum.
In the second case, calculating the entropy of BH through its radiation is physically dif-
ferent procedure, and sheds light on similar approaches such as the brick-wall model [7].
Speciﬁcally, integrating entropies over spacelike volumes, which leads to divergent result
around the horizon, is replaced by an integration over timelike volume at spatial inﬁnity.

• It can be easily checked that considering the gray body factor for the BHs would not alter

our analysis, because Eq. (2) remains unchanged.
