Warm dark matter cosmologies have been widely studied as an alternative to the cold dark
matter paradigm, the characteristic feature being a suppression of structure formation on small
cosmological scales. A very similar situation occurs if standard cold dark matter particles are kept
in local thermal equilibrium with a, possibly dark, relativistic species until the universe has cooled
down to keV temperatures. We perform a systematic phenomenological study of this possibility,
and classify all minimal models containing dark matter and an arbitrary radiation component that
allow such a late kinetic decoupling. We recover explicit cases recently discussed in the literature
and identify new examples that are interesting from a model-building point of view. In some of these
models dark matter is inevitably self-interacting, which is remarkable in view of recent observational
support for this possibility. Hence, dark matter models featuring late kinetic decoupling have the
potential not only to alleviate the missing satellites problem but also to address other problems of
the cosmological concordance model on small scales, in particular the cusp-core and too-big-too-fail
problems, in some cases without invoking any additional input.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dark matter (DM) is about ﬁve times as abundant
as ordinary matter [1] and known to be the dominant
driver of cosmological structure formation. The ΛCDM
cosmological concordance model, which treats DM as a
completely cold and collisionless component in the cos-
mic energy budget, is remarkably successful in describing
the large scale structure of the universe [2, 3]. At galac-
tic scales and below, on the other hand, the observa-
tional situation is less clear and leaves considerable room
for various new physics eﬀects that would lead to devi-
ations from the standard scenario. Several observations
at smaller scales have even been claimed to be in tension
with the expectations within the ΛCDM paradigm [4–
15], see Ref. [16] for a recent discussion. One of the most
often discussed and most long-standing of these issues is
the problem of ‘missing satellites’ of the Milky Way [5, 6],
as compared to the typical number expected in ΛCDM
cosmology, which subsequently was complemented by an
observed underabundance also of small galaxies in the
ﬁeld [7, 9, 13].

According to the leading hypothesis, DM consists of
a new type of elementary particles [17]. The most of-

ten studied class of models postulates weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) to form the DM and con-
nects the observed DM abundance in a theoretically com-
pelling way to extensions of the standard model of par-
ticle physics at energies beyond the electroweak scale.
Standard WIMPs,
like the supersymmetric neutralino
[18] or the ﬁrst Kaluza-Klein excitation of the photon
[19], are prototype examples of cold dark matter (CDM)
as required by the ΛCDM paradigm. Null searches for
such WIMPs at the CERN LHC [20, 21] or in direct de-
tection experiments located deep underground [22, 23],
however, start to severely limit this possibility. Further-
more, from a theoretical perspective WIMPs are by far
not the only possible option for a good DM candidate
[24–27]. DM particles may instead have signiﬁcantly
stronger non-gravitational interactions, either within a
yet to be explored dark sector or with ordinary standard
model particles. This may visibly aﬀect the distribution
of the observed structure in the universe [28–59]. Re-
cently, a framework for an eﬀective theory of structure
formation (ETHOS) has been developed [60] that will
eventually allow to directly map the particle physics pa-
rameters in such models to cosmological observables at
low redshift. This is particularly relevant for those types

of models that would evade any of the more traditional
ways to search for DM at colliders, in direct or indirect
detection experiments. In this case, detailed observations
of the distribution of matter at small scales, for example
in terms of the power spectrum, may be the only way to
test the DM particle hypothesis.

One of the most prominent, potentially observable
features of this type would be an exponential suppres-
sion of power in the spectrum of matter density ﬂuctu-
ations at sub-Mpc scales. The classical way to achieve
this is through the free streaming of warm DM (WDM)
particles, where keV sterile neutrinos provide the pro-
totype example for a well motivated DM candidate of
this type [27]. Such a cutoﬀ in the power spectrum
is strongly constrained by observations of the Lyman-
α forest, typically translated into a lower bound on the
WDM mass. Recent analyses report limits as stringent
as mWDM (cid:38) 4.35 keV [61, 62] which however has been
argued to be overly restrictive when taking into account
that the warm intergalactic medium could mimic such
a cutoﬀ [63]. Completely independent bounds of very
roughly mWDM (cid:38) 1 keV arise from the observed phase-
space densities of Milky Way satellites and from subhalo
number counts in N -body simulations [64]. This range
for the WDM mass, and hence the location of the cutoﬀ,
is interesting because already a value of mWDM ∼ 2 keV
would provide a solution to the missing satellites problem
[42, 65, 66], with slightly larger values at least alleviating
it. Historically, this was indeed one of the prime moti-
vations to focus on WDM [30]. A drawback of WDM
models in this mass range, however, is that they cannot
address the other, at least as pressing, small-scale prob-
lems brieﬂy mentioned in the beginning. In particular,
the cuspy inner density proﬁle of DM haloes expected
in CDM cosmology is not aﬀected in any signiﬁcant way
[67], leaving the cusp-core problem [4, 8, 11] unexplained.
An alternative, and much less explored way of creat-
ing a cutoﬀ in the power spectrum at these scales arises
if DM is kept in local thermal equilibrium with a rel-
ativistic species until the universe has cooled down to
sub-keV temperatures [32, 33, 36, 42, 57, 68].
In this
case, DM kinetically decouples much later than in the
case of standard WIMPs [69] and the remaining viscous
coupling between the two ﬂuids leads to a characteris-
tic ‘dark’ oscillation pattern in the power spectrum, with
a strong suppression at small scales [70, 71].
Interest-
ingly, this is a possibility that arises rather naturally
in self-interacting DM models, allowing to address not
only the missing satellites problem but at the same time
also all other shortcomings of the ΛCDM paradigm [42].
This observation has already triggered signiﬁcant interest
and led to a number of speciﬁc model-building attempts
[46, 47, 50, 53–55, 72] as well as ﬁrst fully self-consistent
numerical simulations of structure formation for this class
of models [16].

Here, we take a much broader perspective and aim at
classifying, in a systematic way, the minimal possibilities
that can lead to late kinetic decoupling with an observa-

2

tionally relevant cutoﬀ in the power spectrum. Such a
cutoﬀ may or may not be related to a solution of the
missing satellites problem, but would in any case provide
a fascinating observational signature that helps to nar-
row down the identity of DM. We use the language of
simpliﬁed models to describe the main ingredients that
are necessary for any model building in this direction,
depending on the spin of the CDM particle and its rela-
tivistic scattering partner. This relativistic particle may
either be the photon or one of the active neutrinos, or
alternatively some form of dark radiation (DR). We note
that the existence of such a DR component is cosmo-
logically very interesting in its own right [73, 74] and
can even be invoked to improve the consistency of dif-
ferent cosmological data sets [75–79]. As a result of our
encompassing approach, we recover all previously identi-
ﬁed conﬁgurations with scalars, fermions and vectors that
lead to late kinetic decoupling, and also ﬁnd further so-
lutions that open new avenues for future model building.
In our analysis, we fully include recent developments in
the theoretical description of the decoupling process (see
the discussion in the Appendix for more details).

This article is organized as follows. We start by dis-
cussing in Section II the generic requirements and lim-
its for any DM model to feature suﬃciently late kinetic
decoupling such as to leave an observable imprint on the
power spectrum or to alleviate the missing satellites prob-
lem.
In Section III we restrict ourselves to simpliﬁed
models containing only the CDM particle and its inter-
action with a relativistic particle, and provide a classiﬁca-
tion of all such models with the sought-after properties.
We extend this classiﬁcation in Section IV by allowing
for a further, independent virtual particle mediating the
interaction. We present a summary of our results and
conclude in Section V. In two Appendices, we provide
a concise review of the kinetic decoupling of DM parti-
cles from a thermal bath (App. A) and list the elastic
scattering matrix elements for all models relevant for our
discussion (App. B).

II. DARK MATTER SCATTERING WITH

(DARK) RADIATION

As motivated in the introduction, we are interested
in scenarios where cold DM can be kept in local thermal
equilibrium with a relativistic species until late times, via
the elastic scattering processes schematically shown in
Fig. 1. The kinetic decoupling of DM from this radiation
component (see App. A for details) then leads to a small-
scale cutoﬀ in the power spectrum of density ﬂuctuations,
corresponding to a minimal halo mass of [16]

solution to the missing satellites problem.

and geﬀ is the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom
around decoupling. Figure 2 shows Mcut as a function
of n, for any choice of the above parameters such that
Mcut = Mn (here, we have assumed a fermionic ˜γ; for
a bosonic scattering partner, Mn would increase by an
amount not visible at the resolution of the ﬁgure). For
reference, we also indicate the cutoﬀ induced by a 2 keV
thermal WDM candidate; as discussed in the introduc-
tion, this provides a rough distinction between what is
ruled out by Ly-α data and what would help to alleviate
the missing satellites problem.
Typical WIMP DM candidates are well described by
the n = 2 case, for which we have M2 = 4.4 · 10−7M(cid:12);
for 100 GeV neutralinos, for example, one ﬁnds roughly
10−7M(cid:12) (cid:46) Mcut (cid:46) 10−4M(cid:12) [69]. Observable values of
Mcut, close to what is still allowed by Ly-α data, thus
clearly require a signiﬁcant deviation from the standard
scenario. Looking at Eq. (4), there appear only a handful
of basic possibilities to increase Mcut in such a way. Let
us brieﬂy discuss them in turn.

• Maximizing the radiation temperature. For DM
scattering with photons or active neutrinos, we
have by deﬁnition ξ = 1 and ξ = (4/11)1/3 = 0.71,

that is expected for a thermal WDM candidate. In order
for such a cutoﬀ to be observable for cold DM and to po-
tentially address the missing satellites problem, we thus
need kinetic decoupling temperatures somewhat smaller
than 1 keV, i.e. much smaller than the MeV to GeV tem-
peratures one encounters for standard WIMPs [69].

Our goal is to systematically classify all (minimal) pos-
sibilities that could give rise to such a late kinetic decou-
pling. To this end, we choose to be completely agnostic
about the nature of DM and the radiation component, so
the latter could either be a form of dark radiation (e.g.
sterile neutrinos) or be given by the standard cosmolog-
ical photon or neutrino background. We simply assume
that there is one DM species, denoted by χ, and one
radiation species scattering with χ, denoted by ˜γ. We
allow arbitrary spins for both species, and scrutinize all
relevant simpliﬁed model Lagrangians (which obviously
could be embedded in more complete frameworks) to see
whether they allow for kinetic decoupling temperatures
in the keV range or not.

A. Generic requirements for late kinetic decoupling

Before we start this endeavor, let us illustrate the gen-
eral challenges for model building that we should expect
to encounter. Consider for simplicity the case where the
scattering amplitude close to kinetic decoupling can be
approximated by a power law in the energy ω of the rel-
ativistic scattering partner,

|M|2 (cid:39) cn(ω/mχ)n .

(3)
For n > −1, we can analytically solve the Boltzmann
equation to determine Tkd, see Appendix A, plug the

 ˜  ˜ ���������������α-������-��-�����������������/����4

cases even increase with decreasing energy ω (cor-
responding to n < 0). This happens in particular
when the DR particle appears in the t-channel, a
scenario which we discuss in detail in Sections III C
and III D.

• Increasing the eﬀective coupling strength. In Fig. 3
we show the value of cn in Eq. (3) that is needed
to produce Mcut = 1010 M(cid:12) (for ﬁxed values of
ξ = 0.5 and geﬀ = 3.36). As can be seen, very large
values of this quantity, and hence eﬃcient enhance-
ment mechanisms for the amplitude are needed for
n > 0 and mχ (cid:38) 1 GeV. For large DM masses,
the required amplitude even becomes so large that
unitarity violation starts to become a possible con-
cern; in critical cases, this needs to be checked on a
model-by-model basis, see e.g. Ref. [81]. Pertur-
bativity restricts couplings to satisfy α (cid:46) 1, so
the only option to achieve such large amplitudes
is a virtual particle that is almost on shell in the
particular kinematical situation we are interested
in (ω (cid:28) mχ and hence −t (cid:28) m2
χ). This can
be arranged both in the s/u-channel and in the t-
channel. As these possibilities typically correspond
to unrelated interaction terms in the Lagrangian,
we will discuss them separately in Sections III and
IV.

• Decreasing the DM mass. From the discussion so
far, a DM mass signiﬁcantly smaller than our refer-
ence value, 1 keV (cid:46) mχ (cid:28) 100 GeV, appears as the
maybe most straightforward way to achieve a larger
Mcut. Indeed, DM particles much lighter than typ-
ical WIMP DM candidates are by no means a prob-
lem per se – though, as we will see, they might be
disfavored in given model frameworks.
The lower bound here results from the assumed lo-
cal thermal equilibrium of a ‘cold’ χ component
with a fully relativistic ˜γ component: independent
of the production mechanism, DM particles lighter
than a few keV would no longer be non-relativistic
around T ∼ 1 keV, and hence subject to similar
constraints as ordinary WDM candidates (unless
ξ (cid:28) 1, which is hard to achieve from a model-
building point of view). Note that if the DM
relic density is set by chemical decoupling from any
of the standard model particles, the lower bound
tightens signiﬁcantly to mχ (cid:38) 1 MeV [82].

FIG. 3. For a scattering amplitude |M|2 (cid:39) cn(ω/mχ)n
close to kinetic decoupling, this ﬁgures shows the value of
cn that results in Mcut = 1010 M(cid:12), as a function of the DM
mass mχ. From top to bottom, the lines correspond to n =
(4, 2, 0,−0.9), and we have throughout ﬁxed ξ = T˜γ/T = 0.5
and geﬀ = 3.36. The color scale indicates the size of the
matrix element for ω → (cid:104)ω(cid:105)Tkd .

respectively. If ˜γ constitutes a form of DR, on the
other hand, ξ is in principle a free parameter.
Observations of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), however, exclude the existence of an
additional radiation component corresponding to
the contribution of one more massless neutrino
(i.e. ∆Neﬀ = 1) by more than 3σ [1].
For
a fermionic (bosonic) ˜γ, this translates to ξ <
0.85 (0.82)/g1/4
, inevitably implying a further sup-
pression of Mcut with respect to what is shown in
Fig. 2.1 Let us also mention that there exists an
independent, weaker constraint on ξ from big bang
nucleosynthesis [80]. Interestingly, this constraint
actually favors a small DR component (unlike the
one from CMB observations).

˜γ

• Minimizing the energy dependence of the scattering
matrix.
It will obviously help if n is as small as
possible. The simplest way to achieve a constant
scattering amplitude (n = 0), in particular, is a
contact interaction, i.e. an (eﬀective) 4-point ver-
tex. We will study this option further in Sec. III A.
In situations with propagators almost on shell (see
the next point), the scattering rate can in extreme

˜γ = (cid:0)ζ(3)/π2(cid:1) N˜γ m˜γ g˜γ ξ3T 3

1 The CMB bound can in principle be evaded if ˜γ becomes non-
relativistic right after kinetic decoupling, i.e. at 100 eV (cid:38) T (cid:38) 10
eV. Assuming that there is no entropy production in the dark
sector afterwards, however, this implies a warm (or even hot)
DM density today of ρ0
0 , where
N˜γ = 1 (N˜γ = 3/4) for a bosonic (fermionic) ˜γ. Demand-
ing that this contribution makes up at most a fraction f of
the total observed DM density, this translates to a bound on
ξ which turns out to be comparable to the CMB bound, ξ <
0.8 (f /N˜γ g˜γ )1/3(m˜γ /10 eV)−1/3. Even if ˜γ is kept in thermal
equilibrium with another, relativistic species this conclusion does
not change qualitatively; we discuss this case in Section III C.

B. Bounds from inherently related processes
Models with a large scattering rate χ˜γ ↔ χ˜γ typically
imply large annihilation rates, χχ → ˜γ˜γ, and in some
cases signiﬁcant DM self-interaction rates, χχ → χχ, as
well. In the following, we will discuss the generic con-
straints for model building that result from these pro-
cesses (while we leave more model-speciﬁc considerations
for later).

So far, we have avoided to make any assumptions about
how DM was produced in the ﬁrst place. However, the
fact that we consider interactions between χ and the ther-
mally distributed ˜γ in order to achieve late kinetic decou-
pling indeed strongly suggests that DM was thermally
produced in the early universe. For cold DM, the relic
density then typically scales roughly as Ωχh2 ∝ m2
χ/g(cid:48)4,
with g(cid:48) being the eﬀective coupling to drive chemical de-
coupling. More concretely, if we assume Mχχ→˜γ ˜γ (cid:39) g(cid:48)2
at chemical freeze-out and only take into account the
leading, velocity-independent part of the cross section,
σv = g(cid:48)4/32πm2

Here, xf ≡ mχ/Tcd and the eﬀective number of degrees
of freedom geﬀ are evaluated at the temperature Tcd of
chemical decoupling. A relic density in agreement with
the observed value of Ωχh2 = 0.1188±0.0010 [1] can thus
not only be obtained for the speciﬁc combination of weak-
scale masses mχ ∼ 100 GeV and couplings g(cid:48)2 ∼ 0.04, but
also for any other combination of mχ and α(cid:48) that leaves
the ratio of these quantities constant (this is sometimes
referred to as WIMPless DM [84]).
Let us now denote with g the eﬀective coupling for the
scattering process, so we expect cn ∼ g4 in Eq. (3). Ro-
tating the corresponding diagrams, schematically shown
in Fig. 1, we see that χχ → ˜γ˜γ must at least contribute
to the total DM annihilation rate. Demanding that these
annihilation processes do not deplete the DM abundance
below the observed value implies a rough upper bound
of g2 (cid:46) g(cid:48)2 ∼ 0.04 (mχ/100 GeV) for ξ ∼ 1 (note that
this argument applies even if the initial DM abundance
was not produced thermally). Using Eq. (4), this in turn
restricts the cutoﬀ mass approximately to

Even when taking into account the impact on the DM
abundance, considering lighter DM particles will thus
in general help signiﬁcantly to achieve a larger value of
Mcut.

Due to the diﬀerent kinematics of scattering and an-
nihilation processes, an intermediate particle nearly on
shell in the former case is not on shell in the latter.
This means that the value of the matrix element can
be much larger for scattering than for annihilation, even
though the ‘same’ diagrams are involved. As can eas-
ily be checked, the argument of the preceding paragraph
still runs through, in exactly the same way, when taking
into account that cn/g4 may in fact be much larger than
unity because of this eﬀect – a possibility which we will
make excessive use of. In this case, the right-hand side of

the case for a DM mass increasing from mχ = 1 MeV to mχ =
10 TeV. We have throughout assumed m˜γ = 100 eV; lighter
masses would give higher cross sections. The dashed parts
of the curves indicate where the coupling strength gχ is so
large that χχ → ˜γ˜γ would deplete the DM abundance below
the observed value. Values above the horizontal thick line are
excluded by dwarf galaxy observations.

2. Dark matter self-scattering χχ → χχ

(cid:112)m˜γ/mχ, resulting

Coupling DM to (dark) radiation inevitably implies
that DM will be self-interacting, too. If ˜γ is bosonic and
there is a direct coupling χ-χ-˜γ, for example, this will in-
duce a Yukawa-type potential with strength αχ = g2
χ/4π
and range 1/m˜γ between the DM particles, resulting in
a characteristic velocity-dependent self-scattering cross
section.2 We are typically interested in the classical limit
(mχv (cid:29) m˜γ), where the velocity-weighted transfer cross
section peaks at around vmax ∼ 0.1gχ
in σT (vmax) ∼ 10/m2
˜γ; for larger velocities v (cid:29) vmax, the
transfer cross section then drops sharply as σT ∝ v−4 (see
e.g. Ref. [89]). Observations of dwarf-scale systems result
in upper bounds on the self-interaction rate of roughly
σT /mχ (cid:46) 10 cm2/g (cid:39) 4.6 · 104/GeV3 [90–94], while con-
straints on cluster scales are up to two orders of magni-
tudes more stringent [95, 96]. Given that vmax is smaller
than the typical velocities encountered in dwarf galax-
ies, however, the former limit constrains the coupling gχ
much more severely in our case.
Following Ref. [60], we deﬁne (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30 as the trans-
fer cross section σT averaged over a Maxwellian veloc-
ity distribution with a most probable velocity of vM =
30 km/s, a value representative for dwarf galaxies. For
σT (v) we use the perturbative result [89] in the Born
limit (αχmχ (cid:28) m˜γ), the parameterization obtained in
Ref. [60] for the classical limit (mχv (cid:29) m˜γ), and an

from approximating the Yukawa potential by a Hulth´en
potential [48]. In Fig. 4, we plot (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30/mχ as a function
of the coupling gχ for various masses mχ. We choose a
reference value of m˜γ = 100 eV, noting that the cross sec-
tions would become even larger for lighter ˜γ particles. In
the ﬁgure, one can clearly identify the diﬀerent regimes
for σT (as well as the imperfect matching conditions,
which are an artefact of our parameterization and bear
no physical signiﬁcance). For αχ (cid:46) 10−7(mχ/GeV)−1
we are thus in the Born regime (for the choice of m˜γ
adopted in this ﬁgure), while for larger coupling we are
in the classical regime (apart from very small DM masses,
where the characteristic resonances from the intermedi-
ate regime start to appear). Besides the bound on the
self-interaction rate mentioned above, we also include in
the ﬁgure the generic upper bound on gχ that results from
DM annihilation processes χχ → ˜γ˜γ, see the discussion
in the previous subsection.

As one can clearly see, the self-interaction bounds are
typically much stronger than those from the relic density.
This implies in particular that the annihilation process
χχ → ˜γ˜γ cannot be responsible for setting the correct
DM density in the ﬁrst place:
in this case one would
need coupling strengths close to the transition between
solid and dashed lines in Fig. 4. For DM masses below
the TeV scale, the self-interaction limits become in any
case so severe that extremely tiny couplings are needed
to evade them. In the classical regime, in particular, we

For a direct coupling of DM to bosonic ˜γ, the self-

loop of the scattering process shown in Fig. 1. We esti-
mate that the resulting bound on the DM-DR coupling
is generically much weaker than the relic density bound
considered above for the range of DM masses relevant
for our discussion (mχ (cid:38) 1 keV). Stronger bounds can
arise in speciﬁc models, however, as we will see in the
following.

III. 2-PARTICLE MODELS

,

We ﬁrst consider models with the minimal possible
particle content, i.e. we assume that there is no addi-
tional particle mediating the scattering process χ˜γ → χ˜γ.
This leaves three basic topologies that we will study in
more detail in the following: A) contact interactions, B)
s/u-channel mediated scattering processes and C) domi-
nantly t-channel mediated scattering processes. For each
of these cases, we will discuss all possible spin combina-
tions that potentially could lead to late kinetic decou-
pling, i.e. we allow in principle both χ and ˜γ to be a
scalar, (Dirac) fermion and vector particle, respectively
(for the sake of brevity, we will however not explicitly
consider pseudoscalars and axial vectors in our analysis).
For simplicity, and to avoid unphysical results, we will
assume that a vector boson is always associated with a
gauge symmetry – which may however be spontaneously
broken to allow for m˜γ (cid:54)= 0. We further require that DM
is stabilized by a Z2 symmetry, i.e. we do not allow for
vertices with an odd number of χ particles. For a quick
overview of our results for this type of models, we refer
the reader to Table I.

where we have conservatively assumed m˜γ = 1 keV and
Mn is shown in Fig. 2. This implies that, compared to the
generic expectation of cn ∼ g4
χ, very large enhancements
of the amplitude from almost on-shell virtual particles are
necessary to achieve suﬃciently large values of Mcut. In-
terestingly, it is also no longer favorable to consider small
DM masses when taking into account the self-interaction
bound.

Light fermions ˜γ, on the other hand, obviously do not
generate a Yukawa potential. A lower bound on the DM
self-interaction rate can then be obtained by consider-
ing the diagrams displayed in Fig. 5, i.e. by forming a

A. Point-like interactions

Let us start with the case of a point-like contact inter-
action, as depicted in Fig. 6. The simplest possibility to
obtain this is with a dimension-4 operator. Due to gauge
invariance, the only such operator that we need to study
separately is in fact the case of a ‘portal interaction’ be-
tween a scalar χ and a scalar ˜γ, leading to a constant
scattering amplitude. This is because a 4-point coupling
between diﬀerent vectors would manifestly break gauge

TABLE I. Overview of results for the 2-particle models we have considered, where the DM particle χ and the (dark) radiation
particle ˜γ can be scalars, Dirac fermions and vectors, respectively. Here, (TOP) denotes the topology of the (dominant) DM-DR
scattering amplitude. Late kinetic decoupling (LKD) indicates whether in this type of models a small-scale cutoﬀ as large as
Mcut ∼ 1010 M(cid:12) can be arranged. Thermal production (TP) indicates whether the observed DM density can be explained by
thermal production via χχ → ˜γ˜γ, and σT indicates the type of the DM self-interaction rate (only for viable models). A white
cell indicates that LKD is possible and that models of this type additionally satisfy the indicated property (e.g. TP). Gray
indicates that the model is either ruled out, or that it is not possible to achieve LKD, for the reason stated. Here, (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30
indicates the DM self-interaction strength at the scale of dwarf galaxy scales and Z2 the assumed symmetry to stabilize DM.
Operators with dimension (dim) larger than 4 map to the scalar/scalar 4-point case if they lead to an approximately constant
scattering amplitude; otherwise they are too small to lead to LKD. Note that t-channel scattering with vector DR is only
possible in a non-Abelian gauge theory and hence covered in the SU (N )-section.

constant scattering rate will have the same phenomenol-
ogy, albeit with a suppressed amplitude, and hence do not
have to be studied separately. Alternatively, a higher-
dimensional operator could add an energy dependence
which, by deﬁnition, cannot come from a propagator. We
therefore expect n > 0 in Eq. (3), where cn is suppressed
by a large mass scale, and Fig. 3 tells us that this com-
bination will not succeed in producing suﬃciently large
values of Mcut.

FIG. 6. Diagram illustrating a point-like interaction of a DM
particle χ with a (possibly dark) relativistic particle ˜γ. Be-
cause we focus on unsuppressed interactions, only dimension-
4 operators are considered, which restricts the analysis of this
topology to bosonic particles.

The only point-like interaction we have to consider in
more detail at this point is thus a portal interaction of

invariance, while a 4-point coupling between a vector and
a scalar would imply the existence of further 3-point cou-
plings that unavoidably lead to additional diagrams of
the form studied in the subsequent Sections III B and
III C.

Higher dimensional operators that lead to an (almost)

As stressed in Section II B 1, however, an additional
upper bound on λ results from the requirement that the
DM annihilation rate χχ → ˜γ˜γ should not become so
large that it would deplete the initial DM abundance
(thermally produced or not) below the currently observed

 ˜  ˜ 8

B. Scattering exclusively via s/u-channel

Let us next consider situations where the scattering
proceeds exclusively via the s- (and hence also u-) chan-
nel. The requirement to stabilize DM via a Z2 sym-
metry then implies, as illustrated in Fig. 7, that the
virtual particle must be χ (recall that by deﬁnition no
further particle beyond χ and ˜γ can be involved in our
simpliﬁed 2-particle model). This means that ˜γ must
be bosonic, and we fully need to take into account the
stringent constraints on DM self-interactions discussed
in Section II B 2. Here, we only consider the case where
˜γ is a scalar or an Abelian gauge boson, and defer the
treatment of the non-Abelian case to Section III D. The
DM particle χ, on the other hand, can only be a scalar or
a fermion because the assumed Z2 symmetry would not
be compatible with a covariant derivative. We calculate
all relevant matrix elements in Appendix B, and list the
results in Table II.

While both diagrams in Fig. 7 individually contain a
resonance, those leading contributions cancel in all cases
exactly in the t → 0 limit. The result is an eﬀective scat-
tering amplitude that is to a very good approximation
independent of the energy ω of the relativistic scattering
partners. We thus obtain the same result as in the con-
tact interaction case, Eq. (11), with the understanding
that we should replace λ2 by the corresponding expres-
sion for (cid:104)|M|2(cid:105) stated in Table II. The essential diﬀer-
ence, however, is that now we have a three-point coupling
giving rise to a strong Yukawa potential between the DM
particles. We can thus combine the result for the cutoﬀ
mass, Eq. (4), with the constraint (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30 (cid:46) 10 cm2/g
on the transfer cross section, where (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30 is supplied in
Eq. (8). This results in

where we have introduced r as the ratio of (cid:104)|M|2(cid:105) for
the scattering process to the fourth power of the dimen-
sionless coupling constant (‘g’) that enters the Yukawa
potential – for the scalar/scalar (fermion/vector) case,
e.g., we have r = 1/2 (r = 64/3).

Equation (13) clearly demonstrates that the strong
constraints on DM self-interactions make it impossible
to achieve late kinetic decoupling if the scattering is
only mediated through s- and u-channel diagrams. We
note that we arrived at this conclusion completely inde-
pendently of the DM production mechanism. We have
assumed in this argument, however, that the DM self-
scattering takes place in the classical regime. For very
light, (sub-)MeV DM (e.g. scalar DM scattering with
hidden U (1) vectors [37]) it may thus be possible to
achieve large cutoﬀ values and evade the self-scattering
constraints.

and require that the resulting value for Ωχ is not smaller
than the observed one. This leads to3

where the maximal value for λ, and hence Mcut,
is
achieved if DM is actually produced thermally (and this
process is dominated by the same portal coupling be-
tween DM and DR). There thus only remains a relatively
small window for the DM mass, namely 1 keV (cid:46) mχ (cid:46)
1 MeV, which leads to a cutoﬀ in an interesting range.
The upper bound here results from the fact that ξ > 1 is
strongly constrained by CMB observations (see also foot-
note 1). Since χ would become WDM for mχ (cid:46) 1 keV,
on the other hand, we have in any case to ensure that
ξ (cid:38) 0.08 in order for the cutoﬀ to be observable.
For this mass range, the DM annihilation bound be-
comes λ (cid:46) 7· 10−7ξ0.5 mχ/MeV. Even though it is para-
metrically suppressed by a factor of λ4, however, the in-
duced DM self-coupling (see Fig. 5) for this model is ac-
tually log-divergent. To be able to remove this divergence
by renormalization, we thus must add an interaction term
∆L = (λ(cid:48)/4!)χ4. Its ﬁnite part can be tuned to any de-
sired value, independent of the above discussion, leading
to a velocity-independent DM self-interaction cross sec-
tion. Let us conclude the discussion of this case by re-
marking that the required small value of λ might most
naturally be realized by a dim>4 operator (as long as it
leads to an approximately constant scattering rate, with
n = 0). See Refs. [36, 50] for examples of large cutoﬀ
masses resulting from such eﬀective operators (and sub-
GeV DM masses). .

3 Note that xf depends logarithmically on the DM mass, which
we have taken into account following the approximation given in
Kolb&Turner [97]. Furthermore, the impact of T˜γ (cid:54)= T during
freeze-out can approximately be taken into account by noting
that we roughly have xf ∝ ξ in Eq. (6). Note that we assume
that ξ remains constant between chemical and kinetic decoupling.

 ˜  ˜  ˜  ˜ 9

smaller than mχ. However, generically we still expect
µχ (cid:29) m˜γ. Lastly, we would like to mention that for
scalar DM and DR one will generally also have a portal
interaction term in the Lagrangian as discussed in Sec-
tion III A. Due to the strong kinematic enhancement of
the t-channel diagram, however, this term will not have
any signiﬁcant eﬀect unless µχ (cid:28) m˜γ.

In the limit where DR is highly relativistic, we ﬁnd for

fermionic DM an average scattering amplitude of

(14)

For scalar DM we ﬁnd the same expression after replacing
√
the dimensionless DM-DM-DR coupling g with the corre-
sponding dimensionful coupling µχ as g → µχ/(
8mχ).
We remind the reader that for such an energy depen-
dence, the general analytic solution referred to in Eq. (4)
is no longer valid. We can still immediately see that in
this case the momentum transfer rate γ, c.f. Eqs. (A7,
A8), would fall with temperature less rapidly than the
Hubble rate. In such a situation, DM and DR would ini-
tially not be in local thermal equilibrium. Once they en-
ter it, however, they would not leave it anymore – leading
to a depletion of structure on large scales that is unac-
ceptable from an observational point of view (unless the
couplings are chosen so small that thermal equilibrium
would only be reached late during matter domination).
In view of this rather unexpected behavior, let us lift
our general assumption of ultra-relativistic DR and inves-
tigate which eﬀect an increased DR mass m˜γ would have
on the cosmological behavior of this class of models. We
will assume that ˜γ still follows a thermal distribution,4
so we should expect that at some point the Boltzmann
suppression of the ˜γ number density will dominate over
−4
the T
scaling from Eq. (14), leading to a suppression
˜γ
of the momentum transfer rate and hence kinetic decou-
pling relatively shortly after the DR has become non-
relativistic.

To investigate this in more detail, we solve the full
Boltzmann Eq. (A13) numerically, noting that the solu-
tion close to kinetic decoupling, and for a given value of
Tkd, only depends on two parameter ratios, m˜γ/ξ and
g2µ2
˜γ/mχ. We ﬁnd that the former quantity is essen-
tially ﬁxed by the requirement to get a cutoﬀ mass of
Mcut = 1010M(cid:12), varying only from m˜γ/ξ = 0.53 keV
˜γ/mχ = 10−20 keV to m˜γ/ξ = 2.0 keV for
for g2µ2
˜γ/mχ = 10−10 keV. For very small couplings lead-
g2µ2
˜γ/mχ ≪ 10−20 keV, on the other hand, it is
ing to g2µ2

4 In contrast to the eﬀectively massless case, this requires thermal
equilibrium of ˜γ with at least one further relativistic species ϕ of
temperature T˜γ . Since we consider here by construction a situ-
ation in which ˜γ is non-relativistic around kinetic decoupling of
the DM particles, the CMB bound on the energy density of ad-
ditional degrees of freedom (i.e. on ξ) thus becomes independent
of g˜γ and only depends on gϕ.

FIG. 8. As Fig. 7, but in the presence of an additional 3-
˜γ coupling, which leads to a resonance in the t-channel in
addition to the s/u resonances shown in Fig. 7.

C. Scattering dominantly via t-channel

Due to the Z2 symmetry for the χ particles, any scat-
tering diagram involving a t-channel exchange is of the
form displayed in Fig. 8. Just as for the s/u case, this
topology thus only allows scalar or non-Abelian ˜γ. Here,
we only consider the former case, deferring a dedicated
discussion of the latter case to the next subsection. Such
models have two independent coupling constants for the
χ-χ-˜γ and ˜γ-˜γ-˜γ vertices. The presence of the former
induces s- and u-channel diagrams of the type discussed
above. Here, we will thus require that those couplings are
small enough to satisfy the self-interaction constraints of
Fig. 4, c.f. Eq. (8), and that the t-channel diagram domi-
nates the scattering process. We note that this is indeed
the generic situation, even for a ˜γ-˜γ-˜γ coupling much
smaller than the χ-χ-˜γ coupling, because of the strong
kinematic enhancement of the t-channel diagram. We
calculate the two relevant matrix elements in Appendix
B, i.e. for scalar and fermionic DM, and list the results
in Table II.

As expected from the familiar Coulomb case, the scat-
tering amplitude from the t-channel exchange of a mass-
less particle diverges, and has to be regulated by intro-
ducing a non-vanishing DR mass term.
In fact, such
a mass term can be argued to arise from requiring the
potential to be bounded from below:
in our simpli-
ﬁed model, this can only be achieved by adding a 4-
point interaction term (λ/4!)˜γ4 to the scalar potential
0/2)˜γ2 + (µ˜γ/3!)˜γ3; considering the global
V (˜γ) = (m2
minimum of this potential then leads to the conclusion
that m˜γ ∼ max(m0, µ˜γ/
λ) (cid:38) µ˜γ,
largely indepen-
dent of the value of m0.
In general, Debye screening
will furthermore generate a thermal mass of the order of
λT˜γ. At temperatures T˜γ (cid:29) µ˜γ, the com-
mDebye
bination of this eﬀect and the requirement of vacuum
stability thus even lead to m˜γ (cid:29) µ˜γ – essentially inde-
pendent of the size of λ.

˜γ

In the case of scalar DM, we have another dimension-
ful constant µχ which denotes the χ-χ-˜γ coupling. Per-

stabilizing Z2 symmetry, restrict µχ to be suﬃciently

1 MeV, the constraints on the DM self-interaction rate
are no longer stronger than those from the DM annihila-
tion rate (as it would be the case for m˜γ (cid:28) 1 keV). This
implies that in this setup one may in fact have thermally
produced DM, with both Mcut and (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30 in a range that
is interesting from the point of view of ΛCDM small-scale
problems. Let us ﬁnally stress that the above discussion
√
applies in full analogy to the case of scalar DM, with the
already mentioned replacement g → µχ/(

8mχ).

D. Non-Abelian dark radiation

Lastly, we consider the case of non-Abelian DR as an
example where treating s/u- and t-channel diagrams sep-
arately is no longer possible. The DM particle can then
be either a scalar or a fermion, which leads to identical
results for the scattering rates (up to a constant factor
of order unity, see Table II). We note that the case of
fermionic DM scattering with non-Abelian DR has been
previously studied in Ref. [58], where it was also pointed
out that the necessarily small gauge couplings imply that
conﬁnement is irrelevant. DR can hence be described as
a perfect ﬂuid just like in all the other model types we
study here.

˜γ

Also in this case, a DR mass has to be introduced
in order to regularize the scattering amplitude. Such a
mass arises inevitably from screening eﬀects in the ther-
∼ gT˜γ [98].
mal plasma and can be estimated as mDebye
On top of this thermal mass, there can of course also be a
temperature-independent mass if the gauge symmetry is
spontaneously broken. In the limit where the DR is still
ultra-relativistic, the squared scattering amplitude is in
any case of the same form as Eq. (14), but with the lead-
ing ω−4 dependence replaced by a ω−2 dependence. Such
a dependence implies that the momentum transfer rate
scales as γ ∝ T 2
˜γ , i.e. up to a factor of ξ2 in the same way
as the Hubble rate during radiation domination. During
matter domination, on the other hand, γ will quickly fall
behind H−1 ∝ T 3/2.

If the leading contribution to the DR mass is ther-
mal, this can result in a very interesting phenomenol-
ogy, where all density perturbation modes that enter the
Horizon before matter-radiation equality are suppressed
in a smooth way (while those that enter after equality
are essentially unaﬀected). Tuning the SU (N ) coupling
strength to α ∼ 10−9 (for N = 2 and mχ ∼ TeV), in par-
ticular, would help to alleviate a certain tension in the
normalization of the power spectrum of density ﬂuctua-
tions as inferred from diﬀerent types of observations [58].
CMB measurements [1], in particular, predict a value of
the observable σ8 that is about 2σ larger than what is
obtained from large scale structure data [79, 99]. Adopt-
ing the above parameter values, we ﬁnd that the result-
ing DM self-interaction becomes (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30/mχ (cid:46) 1 cm2/g
for m˜γ (cid:38) 10−8 eV, thus evading the observational con-
straints on this quantity (see the discussion in Sec. II B 2).
We note that the necessarily small value of α implies that

no longer possible to achieve a cutoﬀ mass of Mcut =
1010M(cid:12) because χ and ˜γ would not reach local thermal
equilibrium early enough in the ﬁrst place.
In Fig. 9, we show the DR mass that is required in
this scenario to get a cutoﬀ mass of Mcut (cid:39) 1010M(cid:12),
as a function of mχ/α and for several values of ξ (solid
lines). We also show, for various values of mχ, the con-
straints that arise from conservatively requiring that the
DM self-interaction does not become too strong, namely
(cid:104)σT(cid:105)30 < 30 cm2/g; everything to the left of the dashed
lines is thus excluded. For mχ (cid:38) 1 GeV, these constraints
scale as expected for the classical regime, c.f. Eq. (8),
i.e. (mχ/α)min ∝ m
. Decreasing the DM mass be-
low about 1 GeV, the limits do not tighten signiﬁcantly
anymore. As shown exemplarily for mχ = 1 MeV, they
feature instead a much stronger dependence on m˜γ in
this regime. This implies, as expected, that for DM
masses even closer to the ∼keV DR mass (required for
suﬃciently late kinetic decoupling) those limits start to
become less stringent again. In the plot, we have ﬁxed
µ = m˜γ. Smaller values will shift the solid lines to the
˜γ/µ2. As long as µ is still large
left, by a factor of m2
enough to bring DM and DR into local thermal equilib-
rium, this has hardly any eﬀect on the allowed range of
parameters in this model.

very roughly achieved for a coupling strength of α ∼
10−6(mχ/10 GeV)5/3, while smaller DM masses require a
stronger coupling than expected from this simple scaling
law. Interestingly, for DM masses smaller than around

to this scaling for the largest DR masses shown in the
ﬁgure. Also in this case, this implies that there is a small
region in parameter space where relatively light thermal
DM, with mχ (cid:46) 1 MeV, can produce an observable cut-
oﬀ in the power spectrum and feature an observationally
relevant, but not yet excluded self-interaction rate.

IV. 3-PARTICLE MODELS

We now extend our discussion to simpliﬁed models
where the scattering between χ and ˜γ is mediated by
a diﬀerent particle. As before, we will require that DM
is stabilized by a Z2 symmetry; this time, however, we
will allow for further, heavier particles to carry the same
parity (which corresponds to the standard situation in
typical scenarios with WIMP DM candidates, like super-
symmetry or universal extra dimensions). This restricts
the logical possibilities to the same topologies as consid-
ered in the previous section, i.e. scattering exclusively
via a heavy particle χ(cid:48) in the s/u-channel (as depicted in
Fig. 7) or scattering via a light particle ˜γ(cid:48) in the t-channel
(as depicted in Fig. 8).
The fact that χ and χ(cid:48) (as well as ˜γ and ˜γ(cid:48)) may dif-
fer in both spin and mass opens several new avenues for
model building and the phenomenology of these mod-
els. Most strikingly, more combinations of particle spins
are now possible (including fermionic ˜γ) and the scatter-
ing can proceed exclusively through the t-channel. The
new mass scale, furthermore, can help to avoid bounds
on the self-interaction of DM, and qualitatively change
the resonance structure of the s/u-channel diagrams. As
before, we will discuss the two fundamental topologies
separately, focussing on those models and aspects that
result in a qualitative diﬀerence to the 2-particle models.

A. Scattering via s/u-channel

Let us ﬁrst consider models with a mediator particle
χ(cid:48) that is slightly heavier than χ and shares the same Z2
parity. Deﬁning ∆m ≡ mχ(cid:48) − mχ, we restrict our analy-
sis to masses for which we have mχ (cid:29) ∆m (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ.
Larger values of ∆m would simply result in suppressed
scattering rates; very small values, on the other hand,
would typically involve serious ﬁne-tuning in concrete
models (and, furthermore, in many cases just lead to
situations that are fully analogous to the s/u-channel 2-
particle models discussed in the previous Section).

A complete list of the relevant models, along with
results for the scattering matrix elements,
is given in
Tab. III. Note that this time there appear no vector
particles in this classiﬁcation. This is because non-
Abelian gauge bosons are not compatible with the im-
posed Z2 symmetry, for the topology considered here,
while Abelian gauge bosons only couple to a pair of iden-

Abelian DR of mass m˜γ. For DR consisting of SU (N )

gauge bosons, we deﬁne αN ≡ g2(cid:112)N (N 2 − 1)/(4π). Solid

lines show the parameter combinations that lead to Mcut =
1010M(cid:12),
for a DR to photon temperature ratio of ξ =
1, 0.5, 0.1 (from top to bottom). Dashed lines show the con-
straints that result from DM self-scattering, for N = 2 and
a given DM mass; everything left to the respective curve is
excluded. Larger values of N result in weaker constraints.

the process χχ → ˜γ˜γ cannot be responsible for the ther-
mal production of DM in this scenario.

Let us instead entertain the possibility, as in the pre-
ceding Section, that the non-Abelian gauge bosons also
have a constant mass term which starts to dominate
around keV temperatures. Requiring again that ˜γ is
somehow kept in chemical equilibrium even after it be-
comes non-relativistic, this would lead to the charac-
teristic exponential cutoﬀ in the power spectrum that
is the main focus of this article. We thus solve the
full Boltzmann Eq. (A13) numerically, requiring again
that Mcut = 1010M(cid:12). Similar to the t-channel case
discussed above, this ﬁxes the ratio m˜γ/ξ in func-
tion of the ratio α2
˜γ/mχ, where we have deﬁned
N (N 2 − 1)/(4π). Again, the allowed values
of m˜γ shows very little variation, from m˜γ = 2.2 keV

In analogy to the case of scalar DR in the t-channel
discussed in the previous subsection, we plot in Fig. 10
the value of of the dark gluon mass m˜γ that is needed for
a cutoﬀ mass Mcut (cid:39) 1010M(cid:12), as a function of mχ/α2

as dashed lines, the constraints connected to DM self-
interaction; here, we simply re-scaled the available pa-

mediators and U (1) mediators expected at tree level. For
mχ (cid:38) 10 GeV, these constraints scale as expected for the

The main constraint on this type of models typically
results from the requirement that the pair-annihilation
rate of χ should not be so large that it would deplete the
number density of χ below the cosmological abundance
of DM. Following the discussion in Sec. II B 1, we thus
have to demand that r1/4g is smaller than the value of
g(cid:48) in Eq. (6) that is needed for Ωχh2 (cid:39) 0.119.6 Using
furthermore xf ∝ ξ, this leads to the following upper

We stress that while the actual bounds are model-
dependent, because the DM annihilation rate may be
dominated by other processes than χχ → ˜γ˜γ, the above
expressions provide very useful order-of-magnitude esti-
mates that allow to classify in which models cutoﬀ masses

Mcut ∼ O(cid:0)1010M(cid:12)(cid:1) can in principle be achieved.

For cases where the scattering rate is almost constant
(n = 0), such large cutoﬀs can relatively easily be ob-
tained for DM masses up to around 10 GeV (or even
larger DM masses if one is willing to accept a ﬁne tun-
ing between mχ and mχ(cid:48) beyond the percent level). We
note that Eq. (16) reproduces as expected the result for
a scalar four-point coupling that we earlier derived in

5 The leading number refers to a bosonic ˜γ, the one in parentheses

to a fermionic ˜γ.

6 Here, we do not include the δ-dependence in the comparison of
the eﬀective coupling constants because this derives from an on-
shell enhancement that is absent for the annihilation process.
Note also that in models where χ(cid:48) is close in mass to χ coannihi-
lations [100] become important. This will increase the eﬀective
annihilation rate during freeze-out, hence leading to a stronger
constraint on g. The actual limits on Mcut are thus slightly more
stringent than stated in Eqs. (16, 17).

Eq. (11), after replacing rg4/δ2 → λ2. The diﬀerent con-
clusions about the maximal mass scale of the DM parti-
cles in these cases (∼ 10 GeV vs. ∼ 1 MeV) arise thus ex-
clusively due to the on-shell enhancement resulting from
δ (cid:28) 1. For an example of this type of model, where a
fermionic DM particle interacts with scalar mediator and
DR particles, see Ref. [53].

For cases with n = 2, i.e. for a fermionic ˜γ, viable
models in the above sense are restricted to sub-GeV DM
masses (for an example of such a model, where fermionic
DM couples to neutrino via a scalar, see Ref. [72]). Re-
quiring mχ (cid:38) 1 keV to avoid the usual WDM bounds,
this also implies that ξ must be rather close to unity –
which is both in some tension with CMB data and an
important limitation for any concrete model building av-
enues. Still, it is very interesting to note that all models
discussed in this Section are in principle viable, if only
for a relatively small range of DM masses and mediator
particles that are highly degenerate in mass with the DM
particles. None of these models, on the other hand, gives
naturally rise to large DM self-interaction rates. Simi-
lar to the case of the simple scalar 4-point interaction
discussed above, those would have to be added by hand.

B. Scattering via t-channel

In this Section, we consider models where we add a
light bosonic particle ˜γ(cid:48) to mediate the interaction be-
tween χ and ˜γ via a t-channel diagram. For simplicity
we only consider models with the following hierarchy of
energy scales: mχ (cid:29) m˜γ(cid:48) (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ. This ensures that
we are suﬃciently far away from the situation discussed
in the 2-particle case, while retaining the possibility of
large scattering rate enhancements through an almost
on-shell mediator particle ˜γ(cid:48).

We provide a complete list of the relevant models,
as well as results for the scattering matrix elements, in
Tab. III. For a dimensionful ˜γ-˜γ-˜γ(cid:48) coupling µ˜γ the scat-
tering amplitudes are always constant, to leading order,
and given by

Here, gχ denotes the χ-χ-˜γ(cid:48) coupling (divided by mχ in
cases where it is dimensionful), and g˜γ denotes the ˜γ-˜γ-
˜γ(cid:48) coupling; r is a model-dependent constant which in
this case takes values in the range 1 ≤ r ≤ 512/3. In all
these cases, the form of the amplitude allows us to use
the analytic expression (4) for the cutoﬀ-mass Mcut.

1 MeV and DM masses in the TeV range it is in general
possible to accommodate thermal DM production and a
DM self-interaction rate that is suﬃciently large to vis-
ibly aﬀect the inner structure of subhalos at the scale
of dwarf galaxies. Comparing this to Eqs. (22, 23), it
becomes clear that the same broad range of masses also
allows a sizeable cutoﬀ in the power spectrum – at least
for the case of n = 2, i.e. where the ˜γ-˜γ-˜γ(cid:48) coupling is
not dimensionful.
Indeed, this corresponds exactly to
the situation ﬁrst described in Ref. [42], and followed
up by several concrete examples for model-building with
vector mediators and fermionic DM and fermionic DR
[46, 47, 54, 55] as well as scalar DR [53]. As one can see
from this discussion, however, there exists a rather large
class of models with this property, including the possibil-
ity of scalar mediators, going clearly beyond the speciﬁc
settings considered so far.

V. CONCLUSIONS

If DM is kept in local thermal equilibrium with a rela-
tivistic species (‘dark radiation’, DR) until the universe
has cooled down to temperatures below ∼ 1 keV, this
results in a characteristic suppression of the power spec-
trum of matter density ﬂuctuations for scales below what
corresponds roughly to the size of the smallest dwarf
galaxies. Such a cutoﬀ may help to alleviate the prob-
lem of missing satellites in the cosmological concordance
model. More importantly, it provides quite in general
a fascinating way of probing new particle physics in the
dark sector by using astrophysical observables connected
to the distribution of cosmological structure. This type
of probe is thus highly complementary to traditional at-
tempts to identify the particle nature of DM.

In this article, we have provided a systematic classi-
ﬁcation of the minimal model-building options that al-
low for such a scenario. The simplest solution turns
out to be a contact interaction between an MeV-scale
DM particle and a relativistic DR particle, either in the
form of a 4-point ‘portal’ interaction between two scalars
or via a suppressed, higher-dimensional operator (Sec-
tion III A). Scenarios where DM couples via a 3-point
coupling to DR, on the other hand, are severely con-
strained by observational bounds on the strength of DM
self-interactions, leaving no room for a suﬃciently late
kinetic decoupling (Section III B). This problem may be
circumvented by allowing for a mediator particle that is
slightly heavier than DM (Section IV A) or lighter than
DM but signiﬁcantly heavier than DR (Section IV B). In
the ﬁrst class of models, DM cannot be too heavy (typi-
cally mχ (cid:46) O(10 GeV)); in the second class, it is rather
the lighter DM mass range that is constrained.

The main phenomenological diﬀerence to WDM sce-
narios, which lead to a similar cutoﬀ in the power spec-
trum, is that in particular the last class of models (fea-
turing t-channel mediators much lighter than DM, and
much heavier than DR) gives naturally rise to relatively

Combination of αχ and mχ that leads to
(cid:104)σT(cid:105)30/mχ = 1 cm2/g, for various mediator masses m˜γ(cid:48) . For
comparison, we also show the value of αχ that results in
the correct relic density when considering only the process
χχ → ˜γ(cid:48)˜γ(cid:48).

An important phenomenological diﬀerence of these
models, as compared to the 3-particle models in the s/u-
channel, is that the light mediator γ(cid:48) will mediate a sig-
niﬁcant velocity-dependent DM self-interaction. Because
we now have the freedom to choose m˜γ(cid:48) (cid:29) m˜γ, the DM
self-interaction rate can be be much more easily arranged
to be in an observationally relevant range (e.g. such as to
mitigate the ΛCDM small-scale problems). In fact, this
can be done while at the same time allowing for ther-
mally produced DM. In Fig. 11 we illustrate this point
by plotting the value of αχ = g2
χ/4π as a function of
mχ that is required to obtain (cid:104)σT(cid:105)30/mχ = 1 cm2/g, for
various values of m˜γ(cid:48). In the same ﬁgure we show, for
comparison, the value of αχ that follows from Eq. (6),
i.e. when assuming that the process χχ → ˜γ(cid:48)˜γ(cid:48) is s-wave
dominated and fully responsible for setting the correct
relic density. We note that a more accurate treatment
would depend on the concrete model. In general, how-
ever, we can expect that the annihilation rate receives an
enhancement due to the Sommerfeld eﬀect. Compared to
what is shown in the ﬁgure, this will result in a slightly
smaller value of αχ necessary to achieve the correct relic
density.
Even though the details are model-dependent, the ﬁg-
ure clearly illustrates that for mediator masses m˜γ(cid:48) (cid:38)

els, it has been noticed before that this fact can be used
to simultaneously alleviate all small-scale problems of
ΛCDM cosmology for thermally produced DM. Here,
we have demonstrated that the models studied so far fall
into a much broader class of viable solutions with this
property, opening thus promising and largely unexplored
model-building avenues.

We have furthermore identiﬁed a new class of mod-
els where the cubic self-interaction of a scalar DR par-
ticle makes the DM-DR interaction increasingly eﬃcient
for small energies (Section III C). In this case, DM and
DR would inevitably be in local thermal equilibrium at
late times, though not necessarily at early times.
If
the dark ‘radiation’ particles are instead massive, with
m˜γ ∼ 1 keV, they will however decouple around the same
time as in the other cases discussed here. For (sub-)MeV
DM, such a scenario would in fact also allow for thermally
produced DM with self-interaction rates in the observa-
tionally relevant rate (similar to the case of non-Abelian
dark ‘radiation’, see Section III D). We leave a more de-
tailed investigation of this interesting observation for fu-
ture work.

Appendix A: Kinetic decoupling

The kinetic decoupling of DM particles from a ther-
mal bath can be described from ﬁrst principles by solv-
ing the underlying Boltzmann equation [71, 103] – just
as the standard way of calculating the relic density of
thermally produced DM particles [83] is based on solv-
ing the Boltzmann equation during an earlier epoch of
chemical decoupling. The original formalism [103] was
later extended to non-relativistic scattering partners [69]
that may have a temperature diﬀering from that of pho-
tons [42, 46], situations in which the DM number density
or the eﬀective number of relativistic degrees of freedom
can change during or after decoupling [41, 69] and, most
recently, to the case where the scattering amplitude is
not Taylor expandable around small momentum transfer
[104, 105]. Here, we provide a brief summary taking into
account these more recent developments.
Consider a particle ˜γ with a thermal distribution g±
of temperature T˜γ, and a non-relativistic DM particle χ
that can interact with ˜γ. The Boltzmann equation that
governs the evolution of the DM phase-space distribution
f in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe
is then given by L[f ] = C[f ], with the Liouville operator7

Note added. While ﬁnalizing this manuscript, two
studies appeared on the arXiv that independently iden-
tiﬁed some of the new scenarios for very late kinetic de-
coupling that we have described and classiﬁed here. In
particular, T. Binder et al.
[101] pointed out that the
fermion/scalar/fermion combination shown as entry B20
in Table III provides such a new solution, while Y. Tang
[102] identiﬁed interacting scalar DR and fermionic DM
as a further possibility (see the fermion/scalar case in
Table III, and the discussion in Section III C).

Here, H = ˙a/a is the Hubble parameter, and (E, p) and
(ω, k) are the 4-momenta of the incoming particles χ and
˜γ, respectively (outgoing momenta are denoted with a
tilde). The scattering amplitude |M|2 is summed over all
internal degrees of freedom, and the phase-space densities
are normalized such that, e.g., the number density of the
particle χ is given by nχ = gχ

with a constant C that is uniquely determined by the so-
lution of the diﬀerential equation. Given that the tran-
sition between the two regimes typically happens rather
fast, it is natural to deﬁne the kinetic decoupling temper-
ature as the point where the two asymptotics meet (see
Fig. 1 in Ref. [69]). This is equivalent to re-writing C,
and hence Eq. (A10), as

Other deﬁnitions of the kinetic decoupling temperature
exist in the literature (see e.g. [49, 50, 55, 107, 108]),
for example requiring that γ = H at the time of kinetic
decoupling, which all are related to the deﬁnition advo-
cated here by multiplying the small temperature regime
of Eq. (A11) with a constant diﬀerent from unity.

The most prominent observable connected to kinetic
decoupling is that of a cutoﬀ in the power spectrum of
matter density perturbations. For very late kinetic de-
coupling, the dominant mechanism of suppressing the
growth of perturbations DM perturbations are dark
acoustic oscillations [70, 71]. As recently conﬁrmed nu-
merically [16], the resulting minimal halo mass is then
given by Eq. (1), which is in rather good agreement
with earlier analytic estimates. Note that Tkd in this
expression is calculated by using the deﬁnition given by
Eq. (A11);
for an alternative deﬁnition, the expected
magnitude of Mcut has to be correspondingly re-scaled.
Let us conclude this Section by making explicit how
the above general analysis simpliﬁes for the purpose of
the speciﬁc application we are interested in for most
of this article: DM scattering with a highly relativis-
tic species, resulting in kinetic decoupling in the keV
range. The latter implies that we are still well in the
radiation dominated era, H 2 = (4π3G/45)geﬀ T 4, with a
constant number of eﬀective relativistic degrees of free-
dom geﬀ = 3.36.9 Eq. (A6) then becomes

As in Eq. (A8), we can evaluate the amplitude at t = 0

eral, the above two equations need to be solved numeri-
cally to determine Tkd according to Eq. (A11), as imple-
mented in DarkSUSY[69, 109]. In many cases of practical
interest, the amplitude is furthermore well approximated

8 Note that this assumes a constant comoving DM particle num-
ber density during and after kinetic decoupling. Otherwise an
additional term must be added to this equation that couples the
evolution of Tχ to that of nχ [41]. This can be relevant, e.g.,
in the presence of a strong Sommerfeld enhancement of the DM
annihilation rate.

9 If ˜γ constitutes some form of dark radiation, this would in prin-
ciple contribute additional degrees of freedom on top of those
from the standard model neutrinos and photons taken into ac-
count here. Such an additional contribution is observationally
strongly constrained [1], and would anyway change the predic-
tion for Tkd only by a factor (cid:46) 1

Appendix B: Scattering matrix elements

In this Appendix, we provide the Lagrangians and scat-
tering amplitudes for all models included in our analysis.
While we use the full expressions to calculate the kinetic
decoupling temperature, we state here only the leading
terms for |M|2 in the limit mχ (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ.
In each
case, we also check explicitly whether keeping only these
leading order terms provides a good estimate for the cal-
culation of Tkd, and whether simply evaluating |M|2 for
t = 0 leads to a reliable estimate of Tkd or whether one
has instead to use the t-averaging prescription given in
Eq. (A8). See Appendix A for more details about how
to calculate Tkd.

1. 2-particle models

Let us ﬁrst consider those simpliﬁed models that only
contain the (cold) DM particle χ and the (relativistic)
scattering partner ˜γ. As motivated in Section III, we are
then interested in the following interaction terms (to in-
dicate the spin of the involved particles, we denote again
scalars always with φ, vectors with V and fermions with
ψ).

We list the squared amplitudes for all those models,
with and without averaging over t, in Table II. In all
cases, the amplitudes squared are summed (not averaged)
over all external spins and polarization states. We also
provide the ratio of kinetic decoupling temperatures that
result when using the t-averaging prescription and the
simpliﬁed t = 0 prescription, respectively. To obtain this
ratio, we calculate the kinetic decoupling temperature by
fully solving the full process equation, Eq. (A13), numer-
ically. In the last column of Table II, ﬁnally, we indicate
whether expanding the amplitude as a power law in the
energy of the relativistic scattering partner provides an
accurate estimate of the correct decoupling temperature
(i.e. whether the analytic result given in Eq. (A16) agrees
with the full numerical result at the percent level).

We are studying here situations with intrinsically large
kinematic enhancements, i.e. where the presence of small
quantites in propagators – namely t, ω and m˜γ – can have
signiﬁcant eﬀects on the amplitude. It should therefore
not be a surprise that we identify cases where the simple
t = 0 prescription brakes down completely. One of those
examples is the case of scalar/scalar scattering via the
s/u channel, where the amplitude evaluated at t = 0 is
proportional to m4
χ while the averaged amplitude is
not suppressed by the small DR mass. A similar issue
appears, certainly not unexpected, in all cases where ˜γ
appears in the t-channel.

TABLE II. Full list of relevant 2-particle models. For the scattering matrix elements, only the leading terms in ω/mχ are
given, assuming mχ (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ (for the t-channel results, we have further assumed that µ2 is suﬃciently large such that the
t-channel amplitude always dominates over the s/u-channel amplitudes). For reference, we provide in some cases also results
for non-relativistic ˜γ. In the next-to-last column, we state the ratio of the kinetic decoupling temperature that results from the
t-averaging prescription to that of the t → 0 prescription. The last column indicates whether keeping only the leading order
result for the amplitude (after averaging or setting t = 0) provides a good estimate for Tkd. In this case the analytical solution,
Eq. (A16), can be used; otherwise, Eq. (A13) must be solved numerically.

Finally, we conﬁrmed that if the squared amplitude
takes the form of a power law in the energy close to ki-
netic decoupling, as well as at slightly higher tempera-
tures, the analytic solution (A16) for the kinetic decou-
pling temperature provides a very reliable estimate for
the full numerical result. For DR in the t-channel, how-
ever, the amplitude close to kinetic decoupling is not of
the form given in Eq. (A15) and, consequently, the ana-
lytic solution cannot be expected to apply.

2. 3-particle models

We now consider simpliﬁed models where the scatter-
ing between non-relativistic DM particles χ and relativis-
tic particles ˜γ is mediated by a diﬀerent particle – either
a ‘DM like’ particle χ(cid:48) which is slightly heavier than χ
(leading to s/u-channel exchange) or a ‘DR like’ particle
˜γ(cid:48) which is much heavier than ˜γ (leading to t-channel
exchange). As motivated in Section IV, we are then in-
terested in the following interaction terms (to indicate
the spin of χ and ˜γ, we denote again scalars always with
φ, vectors with V and fermions with ψ).

TABLE III. Full list of relevant 3-particle models – including DM particles χ, (dark) radiation particles ˜γ, and mediator
particles χ(cid:48) or ˜γ(cid:48). For s/u-channel and t-channel processes, we have assumed mχ (cid:29) ∆m ≡ mχ(cid:48) − mχ (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ and
mχ (cid:29) m˜γ(cid:48) (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ, respectively; in all cases, we state only the leading terms for the squared amplitude. The last two

models. Note that we focus on parameter choices where
we can expect qualitative diﬀerences with respect to the
2-particle models discussed above. Suﬃciently close to
kinetic decoupling, we therefore require mχ (cid:29) ∆m ≡
mχ(cid:48) − mχ (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ (for s/u-channel mediated pro-
cesses) and mχ (cid:29) m˜γ(cid:48) (cid:29) ω (cid:29) m˜γ (for t-channel medi-
ated processes), respectively.

Also in this case, we identify situations where the sim-
ple t = 0 prescription leads to a qualitatively wrong
result for the inferred decoupling temperature.
In the
s/u-channel, this happens for the combination of scalar
DM and fermionic χ(cid:48) and ˜γ, where |M|2
t=0 ∝ ω4 while
(cid:104)|M|2(cid:105)t ∝ ω2.
In the t-channel the ‘critical’ combina-
tions concern fermionic ˜γ and scalar ˜γ(cid:48): unlike suggested
by the result for |M|2
t=0, those combinations do not lead
to an insigniﬁcant scattering rate – but rather to a scat-
tering rate that is (up to a constant factor) the same as
in the case of exchanging a vector particle ˜γ(cid:48). As long as
one uses the correct description for calculating the matrix
element, on the other hand, the analytic solution (A16)
for the kinetic decoupling temperature always provides a
very reliable estimate for the full numerical result.
