Aﬃnoids in the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space and

simple epipelagic representations II: wild case

Naoki Imai and Takahiro Tsushima

Abstract

We construct a family of aﬃnoids in the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space and their formal
models such that the middle cohomology of their reductions realizes the local Langlands
correspondence and the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence for the simple epipelagic
representations. The reductions of the formal models are isomorphic to the perfections of
some Artin-Schreier varieties, whose cohomology realizes primitive Galois representations.

Introduction

Let K be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld with a residue ﬁeld k. Let p be the characteristic
of k. We write OK for the ring of integers of K, and p for the maximal ideal of OK. We
ﬁx an algebraic closure kac of k. The Lubin-Tate spaces are deformation spaces of the one-
dimensional formal OK-module over kac of height n with level structures. We take a prime
number ℓ that is diﬀerent from p. The local Langlands correspondence (LLC) and the local
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence (LJLC) for cuspidal representations of GLn are realized in
the ℓ-adic cohomology of Lubin-Tate spaces. This is proved in [Boy99] and [HT01] by global
automorphic arguments. On the other hand, the relation between these correspondences and
the geometry of Lubin-Tate spaces is not well understood.

In this direction, Yoshida constructs a semi-stable model of the Lubin-Tate space with a full
level p-structure, and studies its relation with the LLC in [Yos10]. In this case, the Deligne-
Lusztig varieties appear as open subschemes in the reductions of the semi-stable models, and
their cohomology realizes the LLC for depth zero supercuspidal representations. In [BW16],
Boyarchenko-Weinstein construct a family of aﬃnoids in the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space and
their formal models so that the cohomology of the reductions realizes the LLC and the LJLC
for some representations which are related to unramiﬁed extensions of K (cf. [Wei10a] for some
special case at a ﬁnite level). It generalizes a part of the result in [Yos10] to higher conductor
cases. In the Lubin-Tate perfectoid setting, the authors study the case for the essentially tame
simple epipelagic representations in [IT13], where simple epipelagic means that the exponential
Swan conductor is equal to one. See [BH05] for the notion of essentially tame representations.
The result in [IT13] is generalized to some higher conductor essentially tame cases by Tokimoto
in [Tok16] (cf. [IT15a] for some special case at a ﬁnite level).

In all the above cases, Langlands parameters are of the form IndWK
WL

χ for a ﬁnite separable
extension L over K and a character χ of WL, where WK and WL denote the Weil groups of
K and L respectively. Further, the construction of aﬃnoids directly involves CM points which
have multiplication by L. In this paper, we study the case for simple epipelagic representations
which are not essentially tame. In this case, the Langlands parameters can not be written as
inductions of characters. Hence, we have no canonical candidate of CM points which may be
used for constructions of aﬃnoids.

We will explain our main result. All the representation are essentially tame if n is prime
to p. Hence, we assume that p divides n. We say that a representation is essentially simple
epipelagic if it is a character twist of a simple epipelagic representation. Let q be the number
of the elements of k and D be the central division algebra over K of invariant 1/n. We write
q = pf and n = pen′, where n′ is prime to p. We put m = gcd(e, f ). The main theorem is the
following:

Theorem. For r ∈ µq−1(K), there is an aﬃnoid Xr in the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space and its
formal model Xr such that

(Xr, Qℓ) realizes the LLC and the LJLC for essentially simple

epipelagic representations.

See Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 6.4 for precise statements. As we mentioned, we have no
candidate of CM points for the construction of aﬃnoids. First, we consider a CM point ξ which
has multiplication by a ﬁeld extension of K obtained by adding an n-th root of a uniformizer of
K. If we imitate the construction of aﬃnoids in [IT13] using the CM point ξ, we can get a non-
trivial aﬃnoid and its model, but the reduction degenerates in some sense, and the cohomology
of the reduction does not give a supercuspidal representation. What we will do in this paper
is to modify the CM point ξ using information of ﬁeld extensions which appear in the study
of our simple epipelagic Langlands parameter. The modiﬁed point is no longer CM point, but
we can use this point for a construction of a desired aﬃnoid.

In the above mentioned preceding researches, the Langlands parameters are inductions of
characters, and realized from commutative group actions on varieties. In the case for Deligne-
Lusztig varieties, they come from the natural action of tori.
In our simple epipelagic case,
they come from non-commutative group actions. For example, the restriction to the inerita
subgroup of a simple epipelagic Langlands parameter factors through a semi-direct product of
a cyclic group with a Heisenberg type group, which acts on our Artin-Schreier variety in a very
non-trivial way.

In the following, we brieﬂy explain the content of each section.

In Section 1, we collect

known results on the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space, its formal model and group action on it.

In Section 2, we construct a family of aﬃnoids and their formal models. Further we de-
termine the reductions of them. The reduction is isomorphic to the perfection of some Artin-
Schreier variety.

In Section 3, we describe the group action on the reductions. To determine the action of
some special element on the cohomology of the reduction, we need to study half-dimensional
cycle classes on some Artin-Schreier variety. This is done in Section 4.

In Section 6, we give an explicit description of the LLC and the LJLC for essentially simple
epipelagic representations, which follows from results in [IT14] and [IT15b]. In Section 6, we
give a geometric realization of the LLC and the LJLC in cohomology of our reduction.

Notation

For a non-archimedean valuation ﬁeld F , its valuation ring is denoted by OF . For a ∈ Q and
elements f , g with valuation v that takes values in Q, we write f ≡ g mod a if v(f − g) ≥ a,
and f ≡ g mod > a if v(f − g) > a. For a topological ﬁeld extension E over F , let Gal(E/F )
denote the group of the continuous automorphisms of E over F .

1 Lubin-Tate perfectoid space

1.1 Lubin-Tate perfectoid space and its formal model

Let K be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld with a residue ﬁeld k of characteristic p. Let q the
number of the elements of k. We write p for the maximal ideal of OK. We ﬁx an algebraic
closure K ac of K. Let kac be the residue ﬁeld of K ac.

Let n be a positive integer. We take a one-dimensional formal OK-module G0 over kac of
height n, which is unique up to isomorphism. Let K ur be the maximal unramiﬁed extension

Noetherian local O bK ur-algebras with residue ﬁeld kac.

of K in K ac. We write bK ur for the completion of K ur. Let C be the category of complete

Let G be a formal OK-module over R ∈ C. For a ∈ OK, let [a]G : G → G be the multiplication
by a, and G[a] be the kernel of [a]G. For an integer m ≥ 0, we deﬁne G[pm] to be G[a] for some
a ∈ pm \ pm+1.

We consider the functor C → Sets which associates to an object R ∈ C the set of isomor-
phism classes of triples (G, φ, ι), where (G, ι) is a deformation of G0 to R and φ is a Drinfeld level
pm-structure on G. This functor is represented by a regular local ring Am by [Dri74, Proposition
4.3]. Then, {Am}m≥0 makes an inductive system. Let I the ideal of lim
Am generated by the
−→
maximal ideal of A0. Let A be the I-adic completion of lim
−→

Am. We put MG0,∞ = Spf A.

Let K ab be the maximal abelian extension of K in K ac. We write bK ab for the completion

of K ab. Let ∧G0 denote the one-dimensional formal OK-module over kac of height one. Then
we have M∧G0,∞ ≃ Spf O bK ab by the Lubin-Tate theory. We have a determinant morphism

by [Wei10b, 2.5 and 2.7] (cf. [Hed10]). Then, we have the ring homomorphism O bK ab → A
determined by (1.1).

MG0,∞ → M∧G0,∞

(1.1)

We ﬁx a uniformizer ̟ of K. Let M∞ be the open adic subspace of Spa(A, A) deﬁned by

|̟(x)| 6= 0 (cf. [Hub94, 2]). We regard M∞ as an adic space over bK ur. For a deformation G of

G0 over OC, we put

Vp(G) =(cid:0)lim

←−

G[pm](OC)(cid:1) ⊗OK K,

where the transition maps are multiplications by ̟. By the construction, each point of M∞(C)
corresponds to a triple (G, φ, ι) that consists of a formal OK-module over OC, an isomorphism
φ : K n → Vp(G) and an isomorphism ι : G0 → G ⊗OC kac (cf. [BW16, Deﬁnition 2.10.1]).

as an adic space over η, for which we write M∞,η. Let C be the completion of K ac. We put

We put η = Spa(bK ab, O bK ab). By the ring homomorphism O bK ab → A, we can regard M∞
¯η = Spa(C, OC). We have a natural embedding bK ab ֒→ C. We put

M∞,η = M∞,η ×η η.

Then, M∞,η is a perfectoid space over C in the sense of [Sch12, Deﬁnition 6.15] by [Wei10b,
Lemma 2.10.1]. We call M∞,η the Lubin-Tate perfectoid space.

We put OD = End G0 and D = OD ⊗Z Q, which is the central division algebra over K of
invariant 1/n. Let [ · ] denote the action of OD on G0. Let ϕ be the element of D such that
[ϕ](X) = X q. Let Kn be the unramiﬁed extension of K of degree n. For an element a ∈ OC,
its image in the residue ﬁeld is denoted by ¯a. We consider the K-algebra embedding of Kn into
D determined by

[ζ](X) = ¯ζX for ζ ∈ µqn−1(Kn).

Then we have ϕn = ̟ and ϕζ = ζ qϕ for ζ ∈ µqn−1(Kn). Let d∧G0 be the one-dimensional

formal OK-module over OK whose logarithm is

1.2 Group action on the formal model

We deﬁne a group action on the formal scheme M(0)
actions on Lubin-Tate spaces with ﬁnite level (cf. [BW16, 2.11]). We put

∞,OC, which is compatible with usual group

Let G0 denote the kernel of the following homomorphism:

G = GLn(K) × D× × WK.

G → Z; (g, d, σ) 7→ v(cid:0)det(g)−1NrdD/K(d)Art−1

K (σ)(cid:1).

Then, the formal scheme M(0)

∞,OC admits a right action of G0. We write down the action. In

For a ∈ µqn−1(Kn) ∪ {0}, let aq−m denote the qm-th root of a in µqn−1(Kn) ∪ {0}

Now, we give a right action of G0 on M(0)
γ(g, d) = det(g)NrdD/K(d)−1 ∈ O×K. We put t = (tq−m)m≥0. Let (g, d, 1) act on M(0)

∞,OC using (1.6) and (1.7). Let (g, d, 1) ∈ G0. We set

∞,OC by

Aα → Aγ(g,d)−1α; Xi 7→ (g, d) · Xi

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

where α ∈ O×K. This is well-deﬁned, because the equation

δ((g, d) · X1, . . . , (g, d) · Xn) = ArtK(α)(t)

is equivalent to δ(X1, . . . , Xn) = ArtK(γ(g, d)−1α)(t). Let (1, ϕ−nσ, σ) ∈ G0 act on M(0)

∞,OC by

Aα → AaK (σ)α; Xi 7→ Xi,

where α ∈ O×K. Thus, we have a right action of G0 on M∞,OC, which induces a right action on

We recall the notion of CM points from [BW16, 3.1]. Let L be a ﬁnite extension of K of degree
n inside C.

Deﬁnition 1.5. A deformation G of G0 over OC has CM by L if there is an isomorphism
L ∼−→ End(G) ⊗OK K as K-algebras such that the induced map L → End(Lie G) ⊗OK K ≃ C
coincides with the natural embedding L ⊂ C.

We say that a point of M∞(C) has CM by L if the corresponding deformation over OC has

CM by L.

Let ξ ∈ M∞(C) be a point that has CM by L. Let (G, φ, ι) be the triple corresponding
to ξ. Then we have embeddings iM,ξ : L → Mn(K) and iD,ξ : L → D characterized by the

Lemma 1.6. [BW16, Lemma 3.1.2] The group (GLn(K) × D×)0 acts transitively on the set of
the points of M∞(C) that have CM by L. For ξ ∈ M∞(C) that has CM by L, the stabilizer of
ξ in (GLn(K) × D×)0 is iξ(L×).

Let (X1, . . . , Xn) be the coordinate of Br. We put h(X1, . . . , Xn) =Qn

We simply write f (X) for f (X1, . . . , Xn), and f (ξr) for f (ξr,1, . . . , ξr,n). We will use the similar
notations also for other functions. We put

S = f0(X) − f0(ξ0

r).

using Lemma 1.3 and the deﬁnition of δ0. The claims follow from this, because

and v(cid:0)f1(X) − f1(ξ0

We put si = (xi/xi+1)qi(q−1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and

Lemma 2.4. Θ is an isomorphism.
Proof. We will construct the inverse morphism of Θ. We can write Y n−1 and S as analytic
functions on B by (2.11), (2.12), (2.13) and (2.15). Then we can write xi/xi+1 as an analytic
function on B by (2.9). By (2.7) and (2.8), we have

As a result, δ(X) = δ(ξL) is equivalent to (2.25) on Br. By Lemma 2.3 and (2.25), we
have v(z) ≥ 0 on Xr. This implies Xr ⊂ B′r. We have the ﬁrst claim by Lemma 2.4 and the
construction of Xr. The second claim follows from (2.14) and (2.25).

Remark 2.6. If n = p = 2, then the curve over k deﬁned by (2.16) is the supersingular
elliptic curve, which appears in a semi-stable reduction of a one-dimensional Lubin-Tate space
in [IT11] and [IT12].

3 Group action on the reductions

Action of GLn and D× Let I ⊂ Mn(OK) be the inverse image under the reduction map
Mn(OK) → Mn(k) of the ring consisting of upper triangular matrices in Mn(k).

Lemma 3.1. Let (g, d, 1) ∈ G0. We take the integer l such that dϕ−l
D,r ∈ O×D. Let (X1, . . . , Xn)
be the coordinate of Xr. Assume v((g, d) · Xi) = v(Xi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n at some point of Xr. Then
we have (g, d) ∈ (ϕM,r, ϕD,r)l(I× × O×D).

Proof. This is proved as in the same way as [IT13, Lemma 3.1].

(y, (yi)1≤i≤n−2) in (3.2). Then, det(gr) = (−1)n+1.

We deﬁne jr : WFr → L×r \(GLn(K) × D×) as follows:

Let σ ∈ WFr. Since ξr,σ has CM by Lr, there exists (g, d) ∈ GLn(K) × D× uniquely
up to left multiplication by L×r such that (g, d, 1) ∈ G0 and ξr,σ(g, d, 1) = ξr by
Lemma 1.6. We put jr(σ) = L×r (g, ϕ−nσ

D,r d).

For σ ∈ WLr , we put aσ = Art−1

Lr (σ) ∈ L×r and uσ = aσϕ−nσ

r

∈ O×Lr .

Lemma 3.6. For σ ∈ WLr , we have jr(σ) = L×r (1, a−1

Proof. This follows from [BW16, Lemma 3.1.3]. Note that our action of WK is inverse to that
in [BW16].

We put

Sr = {(g, d, σ) ∈ G | σ ∈ WFr , jr(σ) = L×r (g, d)}.

Lemma 3.7. The action of Sr on M(0)
Proof. We take an element of Sr, and write it as (g, ϕ−nσ
D,r d, σ), where (g, d, 1) ∈ G0 and σ ∈ WFr.
Since ξr,σ(g, d, 1) = ξr, we have (g, d) ∈ (ϕM,r, ϕD,r)l(I× × O×D) by Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.5.
To show the claims, we may assume that (g, d) ∈ I× × O×D by Proposition 3.2.1. We write

∞,η stabilizes Xr, and induces the action on Xr.

Then Hr acts on Xr by Lemma 3.7 and the proof of Proposition 3.3.
Proposition 3.8. The subgroup Hr ⊂ G0 is the stabilizer of Xr in M(0)
∞,η.
Proof. Assume that (g, ϕ−nσ
D,r d, σ) ∈
Hr. By Lemma 3.1, we have (g, d) ∈ (ϕM,r, ϕD,r)l(I× × O×D). Hence, we may assume that
(g, d) ∈ I× × O×D by Proposition 3.2.1.

D,r d, σ) ∈ G0 stabilizes Xr. It suﬃces to show that (g, ϕ−nσ

and σ−1(θr) ≡ θr mod 1/(n(pe + 1)), since dq−1
0 ∈ µq−1(K) by (3.26). These happen only if
σ ∈ WFr by the proof of Lemma 3.5 and µpe−1(K ur) ∩ µq−1(K) = µpm−1(K). Since σ ∈ WFr,
we may assume that σ = 1 by Lemma 3.7. Then (g, d, 1) ∈ Hr by Proposition 3.3.

Let ι0 : F2 ֒→ Q×

5.1 Cohomology of the reductions and Galois representations

Let X be the aﬃne smooth variety over kac deﬁned by (2.16). We deﬁne an action of Q ⋊ Z
on X similarly as (3.17).

We choose an isomorphism ι : Qℓ ≃ C. Let q1/2 ∈ Qℓ be the 2-nd root of q such that
ι(q1/2) > 0. For a rational number r ∈ 2−1Z, let Qℓ(r) be the unramiﬁed representation of
Gal(kac/k) of degree 1, on which the geometric Frobenius Frobq acts as scalar multiplication
by q−r. We simply write Q for the subgroup Q × {0} ⊂ Q ⋊ Z. We consider the morphism

5.2 Correspondence

Deﬁnition 5.1. We say that an irreducible ﬁnite dimensional continuous ℓ-adic representation
of WK is simple epipelagic if its exponential Swan conductor is one.

We apply the same deﬁnition to a smooth irreducible supercuspidal representation of GLn(K)

and a smooth irreducible representation of D×.

Remark 5.2. The words “simple” and “epipelagic” come from [GR10] and [RY14]. Our “sim-
ple epipelagic” representations are called “epipelagic” in [BH14].

We deﬁne ψ0 ∈ F∨p by ι(ψ0(1)) = e2π√−1/p. We put ψ0 = TrFpm /Fp ◦ψ0. We take an additive
ℓ such that ψK(x) = ψ0(¯x) for x ∈ OK. In the following, for each triple
ℓ , we deﬁne a GLn(K)-representation πζ,χ,c, a D×-representation

character ψK : K → Q×
(ζ, χ, c) ∈ µq−1(K)×(k×)∨ ×Q×
ρζ,χ,c and a WK-representation τζ,χ,c.

We use notations in Subsection 2.1, replacing r ∈ µq−1(K) by ζ ∈ µq−1(K). We have the

K-algebra embeddings

Lζ → Mn(K); ϕζ 7→ ϕM,ζ, Lζ → D; ϕζ 7→ ϕD,ζ.

ℓ ,
we have JL(ρζ,χ,c) = πζ,χ,c and LL(πζ,χ,c) = τζ,χ,c.

Deﬁnition 5.4. We say that an irreducible ﬁnite dimensional continuous ℓ-adic representation

We apply the same deﬁnition to a smooth irreducible representation of GLn(K) and a smooth

irreducible representation of D×.

by the constructions. Then we see that π is simple epipelagic by (6.1), (6.3), (6.4), (6.5), (6.6)
and the assumption HomH (Λa

r, π) 6= 0.

For an irreducible admissible representation π of G1, we write a(π) for its Artin conductor
r,χ,c′) = n + 1, we obtain

exponent. Then, if φ 6= 1, we have a( ˜φ) ≥ 2n. Hence, by a(πa
a(πa

r,χ,c′ ⊗ ˜φ) = a( ˜φ) ≥ 2n. Therefore, we acquire

if φ = 1, anr = ζ and χ′(a)c′ = c,
otherwise

by (6.6) and [BH14, 2.2]. To show the second claim, we may assume that ω = 1. Hence, we
obtain the second claim by the above discussion, using that ωπζ,χ,c is trivial on U 1
K.

Proposition 6.2. 1. If π is not essentially simple epipelagic, then we have HomH(HXr , π) = 0.

as L×r U 1

D × WEr -representations.

Proof. By (5.1), we have a decomposition

as representations of Q ⋊ Z. By Proposition 3.3 and (6.8), we have

HXr ≃ Ma∈µpm−1(K)

(6.10)

and the dimension of this space is pen1.

We prove the second claim. We consider the element (ϕD,r, 1) ∈ L×r U 1

D × WEr ⊂ G2 and its
lifting gr ∈ G in (3.1) with respect to G → G2. We have gr ∈ Hr by Proposition 3.2.1. The
element (ϕD,r, 1) acts on θr,χ,c,ω ⊗ τ 0
r,χ,c,ω as scalar multiplication by cω((−1)n−1r̟). By Propo-
sition 3.2.2, Corollary 4.5, [IT13, Proposition 4.2.3], the element gr acts on HomH(HXr , πr,χ,c,ω)
as scalar multiplication by cω((−1)n−1r̟).

Let zd ∈ O×KU 1

D with z ∈ µq−1(K) and d ∈ U 1

I be the
element deﬁned by a1,1 = NrdD/K(d), ai,i = 1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n and ai,j = 0 if i 6= j. We
have det(g) = NrdD/K(d) and (zg, zd, 1) ∈ Hr. The element (zd, 1) ∈ L×r U 1
D × WEr acts on
θr,χ,c,ω ⊗ τ 0
r,χ,c,ω as scalar multiplication by χ(¯z)θr,χ,c(d)ω(NrdD/K(zd)). We have the subspace

D. Let g = (ai,j)1≤i,j≤n ∈ U 1

HomH (τ−ψ0,n, πr,χ,c,ω) ⊂ HomH(HXr , πr,χ,c,ω)

(6.11)

by the decomposition (6.8). By Remark 1.4, Proposition 3.3 and [IT13, Propositions 4.2.1
and 4.5.1], the element (zg, zd, 1) acts on the subspace (6.11) as scalar multiplication by
χ(¯z)θr,χ,c(d)ω(det(zg)).

Let σ ∈ WEr such that nσ = 1. We take gσ as in (3.14). By Proposition 3.4, the element

gσ acts on the subspace (6.11) by

χ(¯bσ)τ 0

r,ψ0(σ)ω(det(gσ)).

On the other hand, the element (ϕ−1

D,r, σ) ∈ L×r U 1

D × WEr acts on θr,χ,c,ω ⊗ τ 0

r,χ,c,ω by

Hence, the required assertion follows.

(χ ◦ νr)(σ)τ 0

r,ψ0(σ)ω(NrEr/K(uσ)).

Proposition 6.3. If π is not essentially simple epipelagic, then we have HomGLn(K)(Πs, π) = 0.
Further, we have

HomGLn(K)(Πs, πζ,χ,c,ω) ≃(ρζ,χ,c,ω ⊗ τζ,χ,c,ω

pm−1
n1 = s,

as D× × WK-representations.

Proof. For g ∈ Hr\G/G1, we choose an element ˜g ∈ G2 whose image in H r\G2 equals g under
the natural isomorphism Hr\G/G1 ≃ H r\G2. We put H ˜g = ˜g−1H ˜g. Let H ˜g
Xr denote the
representation of H ˜g which is the conjugate of HXr by ˜g. Then, we have

Πs|G1 ≃ Mg∈Hr\G/G1

c-IndG1

H ˜gH ˜g

Xr ≃ Πs|G1 ≃ MH r\G2

c-IndG1

H HXr

(6.12)

as G1-representations, since we have H ˜g = H and HXr ≃ H ˜g
and Frobenius reciprocity, we acquire

Xr as H-representations. By (6.12)

HomG1(Πs, πζ,χ,c,ω) ≃ MH r\G2

HomH (HXr, πζ,χ,c,ω).

(6.13)

pm−1

If ζ

6= s, the required assertion follows from (6.13) and Proposition 6.2.1. Now, assume

n1
pm−1
n1 = s. Without loss of generality, we may assume that ζ equals r, because Πs depends

that ζ
only on s. By Proposition 6.2 and Frobenius reciprocity, we obtain a non-zero map

By applying IndG2
H r

to the map (6.14), we acquire a non-zero map

ρr,χ,c,ω ⊗ τr,χ,c,ω → IndG2
H r

HomH(HXr, πr,χ,c,ω).

(6.15)

We have dim ρr,χ,c,ω = (qn − 1)/(q − 1) and dim τr,χ,c,ω = n. Moreover, we have [G2 : H r] =
n′(qn − 1)/n1(q − 1). Hence, the both sides of (6.15) are n(qn − 1)/(q − 1)-dimensional by
Proposition 6.2.1. Since ρr,χ,c,ω ⊗ τr,χ,c,ω is an irreducible representation of G2, we know that
(6.15) is an isomorphism as G2-representations. On the other hand, we have a non-zero map

IndG2
H r

HomH(HXr , πr,χ,c,ω) → HomG1(Πs, πr,χ,c,ω)

(6.16)

by Frobenius reciprocity. Since the left hand side is an irreducible representation of G2 and the
both sides have the same dimension by (6.13), we know that (6.16) is an isomorphism. Hence,
the required assertion follows from the isomorphisms (6.15) and (6.16).

Theorem 6.4. Let LJ be the inverse of JL in Proposition 5.3. We put

Π = Ms∈µ n1(q−1)

pm−1

Πs.

(K)

Let π be a smooth irreducible representation of GLn(K). Then, we have

HomGLn(K)(Π, π) ≃(LJ(π) ⊗ LL(π)

0

if π is essentially simple epipelagic,
otherwise

as D× × WK-representations.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 5.3 and Lemma 6.3, because every essentially simple
epipelagic representation is isomorphic to πζ,χ,c,ω for some ζ ∈ µq−1(K), χ ∈ (k×)∨, c ∈ Q×
ℓ and
a smooth character ω : K× → Q×
ℓ .
