Abstract

We study the representation theory of the algebraic Toeplitz algebra R = Khx, yi/hxy − 1i,
give a few new structure and homological theorems, completely determine one-sided ideals and
survey and re-obtain results from the existing literature as well. We discuss its connection to
Kaplansky’s direct ﬁniteness conjecture, and a possible approach to it based on the module
theory of R. In addition, we discuss the conjecture’s connections to several central problems in
mathematics, including Connes’ embedding conjecture.1

Introduction

The Jacobson algebra or the Toeplitz-Jacobson algebra is the associative K-algebra deﬁned by
R = Khx, yi/(xy − 1), over some ﬁeld K. Over time its relevance to contemporary mathematics
has grown:
it is a Leavitt path algebra, naturally connected to the direct ﬁniteness of algebras
(a universal algebra for this problem), and possesses interesting representation-theoretic and ring-
theoretic properties [17].
It can also be deﬁned as the subalgebra of EndK(V ) for a countable
dimensional vector space V = K(ℵ0), generated by the left and right shift operators deﬁned with
respect to a ﬁxed basis, and analytic counterparts have been present in operator theory for a long
time as well. Quite a bit is known about the Jacobson algebra; unfortunately, this information is
spread across several sources. A partial aim of this article is to summarize and condense some of
this information for easy reference, as well as provide a few new results. In general, we phrase these
results in terms of the above presentation, which is of importance to the study of direct ﬁniteness.
In particular, we classify completely the left, right and two-sided ideals, and directly recover
known results on this algebra. We characterize ﬁnite-length modules in terms of Ext groups,
determine Ext groups between ﬁnite length modules and explicitly construct an equivalence of
categories in the vein of [7], which produces a parameterization of ﬁnite length modules, in the
form of a functor from ﬁnite dimensional representations of the Toeplitz graph to ﬁnite length
modules over R.

We aim to bring to the attention of a possibly diverse audience of mathematicians the con-
nections between several long standing conjectures in mathematics. Hence, we brieﬂy present and
survey the current state of the Direct Finiteness Conjecture of Kaplansky, and recently discovered
close connections with problems appearing from operator theory, group theory, symbolic dynamics,
logic, and mathematical physics as well as to a central conjecture in mathematics, Connes’ Embed-
ding conjecture, and discuss possible new results from this perspective. Finally, we discuss possible
new approaches to the Direct Finiteness Conjecture of Kaplansky, based on the representation
theory of R.

Many of the representation-theoretic properties of R can be attributed to its unique ideal
structure. Indeed, we have the following, which the reader can conﬁrm through direct computation:

Theorem 1. The socle of R is the two-sided ideal I = h1 − yxi, and it is the unique minimal two-

∞

sided ideal of R. I decomposes into a countable direct sum I =

Sn of simple left modules (ideals),

and similarly to the right, where Sn is faithful, generated by the idempotent fn := yn−1xn−1 − ynxn,
and Sn ∼= S1 for n ≥ 1.

Proof. See, for instance, [3], [8], [11].

Using the fact that I is the unique minimal two-sided ideal of R, one sees that a simple module
T is either not faithful, in which case it is a simple module over the Laurent polynomials R/I =
K[X, X −1], or it is faithful and any surjective morphism ϕ : R → T of left modules satisﬁes
I 6⊆ ker(ϕ). In this case ϕ restricts to a surjection ϕ|I : I → T ; hence, T ∼= S1. See, for instance,
[8]. The simple module S = S1 can be viewed as the above mentioned representation of R into
End(V ); indeed, S = S1 = SpanK{f1, yf1, y2f1, . . . , } and x and y act as left and right shifts,
respectively.

One can also recover this classiﬁcation from general results on Leavitt path algebras. Indeed,

R is the Leavitt path algebra of the following graph, hereafter refered to simply as Γ:

e

u•

•v

f

(1)

Theorem 1.1 of [6] then applies, and we see that all simple R-modules are Chen modules [12].
The Jacobson algebra also enjoys nice homological properties. In particular, it is hereditary [8],
[5]. As a consequence, the classiﬁcation of projective modules is reduced to the classiﬁcation of left
ideals; and every left ideal is isomorphic to either S⊕k
for some k, I, or R. Of course, this means
that up to isomorphism, the only indecomposable projective is S = S1.

2 The results

Ideal structure

In regards to ideals of R, we can be quite explicit; our aim is to provide a complete structural
theorem (not only up to isomorphism) in terms of the generators x, y (which are speciﬁc for this
Leavitt path algebra), in view of the connections to direct ﬁniteness.

Theorem 2. Every left ideal of R is of the form Σ ⊕ Rp(x) where p(x) is a polynomial and Σ is
contained in the socle of R.

k

Proof. Observe that R/Rxk ∼=

Si for each k ≥ 1.

It then follows that if an R-module M

Mi=1

possesses a generating set G = {mα | α ∈ A}, each of which is annihilated by a power of x, then
M is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of S1. Now, suppose that M is a left ideal. Then the
indexing set A may be partitioned into A = A1 ∪ A2, with α ∈ A1 if and only if mα is annihilated
by some power of x. But since xy = 1 and the collection {yixj | i, j ≥ 0} forms a K-basis for
R, for each α ∈ A2 there exists an xkα such that pα(x) := xkαmα is a polynomial in x. But

Rpα(x)

then M/
by powers of x. Hence M/

Xα∈A2

 is generated by the cosets of elements in G, which are each annihilated
 is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of S1, and in

Rpα(x)

particular projective. In other words, M may be written as M = Σ ⊕ P , where Σ is contained
in the socle of R and P is generated by the polynomials {pα(x) | α ∈ A2}. Since P necessarily
contains the ideal of K[x] generated by the pα’s, there exists a single p(x) ∈ K[x] generating this
left ideal P .

Corollary 1. Let Σ ⊕ Rp(x) be as in the previous theorem. If p(x) 6= 0 then Σ ⊕ Rp(x) is ﬁnitely-
generated (and Σ is of ﬁnite length). In particular, every left ideal of R is either semisimple or
ﬁnitely-generated.

Proof. The R-module homomorphism R → Rp(x) mapping 1 7→ p(x) is an isomorphism, and
therefore maps the socle of R onto the socle of Rp(x). In other words, Ip(x) = Soc(Rp(x)). Since
Rp(x) is a left ideal, we must also have Ip(x) = Rp(x) ∩ I. Now, the injection I → R descends to
an injection I/Ip(x) = I/(I ∩ Rp(x)) → R/Rp(x), and the image of this map is (I + Rp(x))/Rp(x),
and (R/Rp(x))/(I + Rp(x))/Rp(x) ∼= R/(Rp(x) + I) ∼= K[x, x−1]/(p). Hence, we have a short
exact sequence 0 → I/Ip(x) → R/Rp(x) → K[x, x−1]/(p) → 0. Now, I/Ip(x) is a quotient

of a semisimple module, and is therefore semisimple. We claim that

Si ⊕ Ip(x) = I, where

sequence 0 →

S1 → R/Rp → K[x, x−1]/(p) → 0.

In particular, R/Rp has ﬁnite length.

Therefore, so does (Σ ⊕ Rp)/Rp ∼= Σ. Hence, Σ ⊕ Rp is ﬁnitely generated.

Mi=1

In particular, this recovers the classiﬁcation of projectives in a direct way. Note that since
1 = f1 + yx, R ∼= R ⊕ S and so R ∼= R ⊕ Σ for every ﬁnitely generated semisimple module Σ (this
relation is a particular instance of the Ara-Mareno-Pardo Realization Theorem [1].) In particular,
since Rp(x) ∼= R and S is projective, by the previous Corollary we see directly that R is hereditary.
Therefore, every projective is a direct sum of left ideals, and so, we get

Corollary 2. Up to isomorphism, every projective R-module P is of the form P = R(α) ⊕ S(β)
for cardinalities α, β. Moreover, (α, β) can be chosen in one of the following two forms, which
completely describe the isomorphism type of P :

3

(1) α ﬁnite, β = 0 or β ≥ ℵ0
(2) α inﬁnite, β = 0 or β > α.

Proof. This follows since Rα ⊕ Sβ ∼= Rα whenever β ≤ α or they are both ﬁnite.

We now note that for an ideal H = Σ ⊕ Rp(x) as above, then of course, p(x) is not unique: we

have R =

Si ⊕ Rxd, and hence

H = Σ ⊕ Rp(x) = Σ ⊕ (

Mi=1

Si ⊕ Rxd)p(x) = Σ ⊕ (

Mi=1

Si)p(x)! ⊕ Rxdp(x).

(2)

Nevertheless, such a p of minimal degree is, in fact, unique up to scalar multiplication. Let H ∩ K[x]
be generated by h(x) as an ideal of K[x] (which is isomorphic to polynomials in one variable over
K); that is, h(x) is a polynomial of minimal degree in H. If p(x) is as in (2), then p(x) generates
H + I/I in R/I = K[x, x−1], so h(x) = λxdp(x) or p(x) = λxdh(x) modulo I for some d ≥ 0 and
λ ∈ K×. Since every element of I is annihilated by a power of x, we get either xnh(x) = λxn+dp(x)
or xnp(x) = λxn+dh(x) for some n. By canceling inside K[x] and using the minimality of h, it
must be that p(x) = λxdh(x). But, again by equation (2), we now see that h(x) has the same
property: H = Σ′ ⊕ Rh(x) for some semisimple Σ′ ⊆ I. Hence, p(x) will be uniquely determined
up to scalar multiplication by either of the conditions that (1) it is of minimal degree in H or (2)
it is of minimal degree for which H = Σ ⊕ Rp(x) for some semisimple Σ.

Also, note that if H = Σ ⊕ Rp(x), then length(Σ) ≤ deg(p), since R/Rp ∼= Sdeg(p) as seen

before. Furthermore, since R = Rp(x) ⊕

Li=1

Si so R/Rp(x) ∼=

Si, given H ⊇ Rp(x), there is a

Si for which H = Σ(H) ⊕ Rp(x). Hence, we may summarize the

Theorem 3. If H is a left ideal of R, then either H is semisimple (so contained in I), or there is
a unique monic polynomial p(x) ∈ H of minimal degree, and H is of the form H = Σ(H) ⊕ Rp(x),
for a uniquely determined submodule Σ(H) ⊆ S1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Sdeg(p).

We further remark that the above submodule Σ of I is uniquely determined as follows. Note
that S1 ∼= Sn by an isomorphism taking f1 to xn−1fn (and the basis {f1, yf1, y2f1, . . . } to the
corresponding basis {xn−1fn, yxn−1fn, y2xn−1fn . . . }). The span of I0 = {xk−1fk|k ≥ 1} is the
socle of I regarded as a K[x]-module; in fact, I is a direct sum of countably many copies of the
injective hull of K[x]/(x), regarded as a K[x]-module, and it is injective over K[x] (as K[x] is
Noetherian; we will use this fact later). Then Σ0 = SpanK(I0) ∩ Σ is the K[x]-socle of Σ, and this
completely determines Σ via the action of y: Σ = RΣ0 = K[y]Σ0. This gives a complete set of
parameters completely and uniquely determining any given non-semisimple ideal of H, in the form of
a polynomial p(x) and a ﬁnite dimensional subspace L of I0, contained in Span{f1, xf2, . . . , xd−1fd},
d = deg(p). When H is semisimple and contained in I, then again, its K[x]-socle determines it as
above. Hence we have

Corollary 3. Any ideal of R can be written as a direct sum of R-submodules

H = K[y]L ⊕ Rp(x)

(3)

where if H is non-semisimple then p(x) the unique non-zero polynomial in x belonging to H, and
L = H ∩SpanK(I0)∩S1⊕. . . Sdeg(p); if H is semisimple, p(x) = 0, L = H ∩SpanKI0 and H = K[y]L.

Determining Ext spaces

The above gives us information on cyclic R-modules, which are isomorphic to quotients of R by
left ideals. If, in particular, R/L is a cyclic module with L ﬁnitely-generated non-semisimple, the
above proof can be modiﬁed to show that R/L has ﬁnite length. For general ﬁnite-length modules
we have the following:

Theorem 4. Every ﬁnite-length module M is the middle term of a short exact sequence 0 →
S⊕k
1 → M → F → 0, where k ∈ N and F is ﬁnite-dimensional. All ﬁnite-dimensional R-modules
are direct sums of the modules Lp = K[x, x−1]/(p), p a (not-necessarily irreducible) polynomial,

k

and there is a natural identiﬁcation Ext1(Lp, S⊕k

1 ) ∼=

K[T ]/(p∗(T )) = (K[T ]/(p∗(T )))⊕k, where

p∗ is the polynomial deﬁned by p∗(y) = p(x)ydeg(p) ∈ K[y] ⊆ R.

Proof. The ﬁrst claim comes from the classiﬁcation of simple R-modules, and the fact that S1 is
projective. The case where Lp is a simple module in the sense of [12] is discussed in [1]. In general,
we start by verifying that Rp∗ = Rp + I. Indeed, Rp + I is a left ideal whose correspondent in
the commutative quotient algebra R/I is two-sided, hence is itself a two-sided ideal. Therefore,

n

p∗ = pyn ∈ Rp + I, so Rp∗ ⊂ Rp + I. If p(x) =

n

n

Xi=0

αixi, then p∗(y) = Pn

i=0 αiyn−i. Therefore,

xnp∗(y) =

αixnyn−i =

αixi = p(x), so that Rp ⊂ Rp∗. Therefore, since I =

Si ⊕ Ip, to

prove the reverse containment it suﬃces to show that fk ∈ Rp∗ for all k ≤ n. We ﬁrst compute

f1p∗ = (1 − yx)

αiyn−i =

αiyn−i − αnyx −

αiyn−i = αn − αnyx = αnf1. Since αn 6= 0,

n

Mi=1

it follows that f1 ∈ Rp∗. Now, assume that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and that fi ∈ Rp∗ for all 1 ≤ i < k. Then

fkp∗ =

αifkyn−i =

αiyn−ifk−(n−i) = αnfk +

αiyn−ifk−(n−i), where fj = 0 for j < 1. By

the induction hypothesis, we conclude that fk ∈ Rp∗, which proves the desired equality.

It follows that R/Rp∗ ∼= Lp, so we obtain a short exact sequence 0 → Rp∗ → R → Lp → 0.

Applying Hom(−, S⊕k

1 ) to this sequence yields an exact sequence

0 → Hom(Lp, S⊕k

1 ) → Hom(R, S⊕k

1 ) → Hom(Rp∗, S⊕k

1 ) → Ext1(Lp, S⊕k

1 ) → Ext1(R, S⊕k

1 ) = 0

where the last equality follows since R is projective. Also note that Hom(Lp, S⊕k
1 ) = 0, since S1 is
simple and inﬁnite dimensional, while Lp is always ﬁnite-dimensional. To compute Ext1(Lp, S⊕k
1 ),
take a non-zero morphism φ : Rp∗ → S⊕k
1 . Consider the problem of extending φ to a morphism
¯φ : R → S⊕k
1 . We identify S1 with R/Rx, with basis {yi | i ≥ 0}. If ¯φ extends φ, then p∗ ¯φ(1) =
¯φ(p∗) = φ(p∗). But there exist points f = (f1, . . . , fk), g = (g1, . . . , gk) ∈ K[y]k such that φ(p∗) = f
and ¯φ(1) = g, where f = (f1, . . . , fk).
It follows that f = p∗g = p∗g. Since Rx contains no
non-zero polynomials in y, it follows that fi(y) = p∗gi(y) in R, for all i. Conversely, suppose that
f and g are given, satisfying this equation. Then since Rp∗ and R are free, there exist unique
R-module morphisms φ, ¯φ satisfying φ(p∗) = f and ¯φ(1) = g. Then ¯φ extends φ, i.e. the above

diagram commutes. In other words, the map Θ : Hom(Rp∗, S⊕k

1 ) →

k

Θ(φ) = f (T ) is surjective, with kernel Hom(R, S⊕k

Of course, we could have just done the computation above for k = 1, but we wanted to emphasize
how the extensions are obtained in general. In fact, we may use this result to compute the dimension

5

of Ext1(M1, M2), for M1 and M2 ﬁnite-length modules. To see this, again recall that if M has ﬁnite-
length, then M is the middle term of a short exact sequence 0 → S⊕k
1 → M → F → 0, where F
is ﬁnite-dimensional. In fact, S⊕k
1 = IM , where I = Soc(R) and k is the number of times that S1
appears as a factor in a composition series for M . Of course, F = M/IM . It will be useful to deﬁne
d(M ) to be the largest non-negative integer for which M = S⊕d(M )
⊕ M ′ for some submodule M ′;
this is obviously well deﬁned by Krull-Schmidt.

1

Decomposing F into indecomposable components, we are able to compute Ext1(F, S1) and
Ext1(F, S⊕k
1 ) using the above theorem and the ﬁnite additivity properties of Ext1(·, ·). Fur-
thermore, since S1 is projective, Ext(M, S⊕k
1 ) ⊕
Ext1(M ′, S⊕k

generality that d(M ) = 0, i.e. that M has no S1-direct summands; the general case reduces to this
by working with M/Sd(M )

Corollary 4. If M has ﬁnite length and no S1-direct summands, then dimK Ext1(M, S⊕k

k [dimK M/IM − ℓ(IM )], where ℓ(IM ) denotes the length of IM . In the general case when d(M ) 6=

Indeed,

Proof. Apply HomR(−, S1) to the short exact sequence 0 → IM → M → M/IM → 0 to
get the long exact sequence 0 → HomR(M/IM, S1) → HomR(M, S1) → HomR(IM, S1) →
Ext1(M/IM, S1) → Ext1(M, S1) → Ext1(IM, S1) = 0, since IM is projective. We claim that
HomR(M, S1) = 0.
if there is a 0 6= ϕ ∈ HomR(M, S1), then ϕ is surjective and
hence M/ ker ϕ = S1. Since S1 is projective, M = ker ϕ ⊕ S1, contrary to hypothesis. So
we have a short exact sequence 0 → HomR(IM, S1) → Ext1(M/IM, S1) → Ext1(M, S1) → 0,
and hence dimK Ext1(M, S1) = dimK Ext1(M/IM, S1) − dimK HomR(IM, S1). But M/IM is
ﬁnite-dimensional, and it easily follows from the previous theorem that dimK Ext1(M/IM, S1) =
dimK M/IM . Furthermore, dimK HomR(IM, S1) = ℓ(IM ) since HomR(S1, S1) = K, and the gen-
eral formula follows by ﬁnite additivity of Ext1(M, −).

For an R-module M , we will use lf(M ) to denote the sum of all ﬁnite-dimensional submodules
of M . It is the largest locally ﬁnite submodule of M . We can then compute the dimensions of Ext
groups between ﬁnite-length modules. More explicitly, we reduce the computations (recursively) to
computations of Ext- and Hom- groups between ﬁnite-dimensional K[x, x−1]-modules, where the
answers are already known by classical PID theory; in the most general case, the answer is written
also in terms of the dimension of the Hom-space Hom(M, N ). Note that if M, N are of ﬁnite length,
then HomR(M, N ) is ﬁnite dimensional, which follows inductively in a standard argument because
dim(EndR(T )) < ∞ for every simple R-module T .

Corollary 5. Suppose M and N are ﬁnite-length R-modules and that F is a ﬁnite-dimensional
R-module. Then the following formulas hold:

(i)

dimK Ext1(F, N ) = dimK Ext1

K[x,x−1](F, N/IN ) + ℓ(IN ) dimK F

+ dimK HomK[x,x−1](F, lf(N )) − dimK HomK[x,x−1](F, N/IN ).

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

dimK Ext1(M, N ) = dimK Ext1(M/IM, N ) + dimK HomR(M, N ) −
dim HomK[x,x−1](M/IM, lf (N )) − ℓ(IM )ℓ(IN ).

dimK Ext1(M, F ) = dimK Ext1
dimK Ext1(M, N ) = dimK Ext1

K[x,x−1](M/IM, F ).
K[x,x−1](M/IM, N/IN ) + dimK(Ext1(M, IN ))

+ dimK HomR(M, N ) − dimK HomK[x,x−1](M/IM, N/IN )
−d(M )ℓ(IN ).

Proof. For the ﬁrst formula, apply HomR(F, −) to the sequence 0 → IN → N → N/IN →
0 to get the long exact sequence 0 → HomR(F, IN ) → HomR(F, N ) → HomR(F, N/IN ) →
Ext1(F, IN ) → Ext1(F, N ) → Ext1(F, N/IN ) → 0, where the higher-order terms vanish because

6

It is then straightforward to verify that HomR(F, N ) = HomK[x,x−1](F, lf(N ))
R is hereditary.
In other
and that the map HomR(F, N ) → HomR(F, N/IN ) is injective (HomR(F, IN ) = 0).
words, we have a short exact sequence 0 → HomK[x,x−1](F, lf(N )) → HomK[x,x−1](F, N/IN ) →
Ext1(F, IN ) → Ext1(F, N ) → Ext1
K[x,x−1](F, N/IN ) → 0, which in combination with Theorem 4
implies the ﬁrst formula.

For the second, apply HomR(−, N ) to the short exact sequence 0 → IM → M → M/IM → 0

to get the exact sequence

0 → Hom(M/IM, N ) → Hom(M, N ) → Hom(IM, N ) → Ext1(M/IM, N ) → Ext1(M, N ) → 0

Since HomR(M/IM, N ) = HomK[x,x−1](M/IM, lf(N )), dimK(Hom(M, N )) < ∞ and further-

more HomR(IM, N ) = HomR(IM, IN ) = ℓ(IM )ℓ(IN ), this yields the required result.
(iii) and (iv) are similar.

A categorical equivalence and parametrizations of R-modules

Obtaining information on general R-modules is not as easy, but there are still things we can say.
Somewhat surprisingly, we can derive a connection between the representation theory of R and
that of Γ. We provide an explicit construction below.

To start, pick an R-module M and consider the canonical short exact sequence 0 → IM →
M → M/IM → 0. As previously mentioned, IM is the sum of all faithful simple submodules of M
(the S-socle) and M/IM is annihilated by I, hence a module over K[x, x−1]. Furthermore, S1 is the
injective hull of the K[x]-module K[x]/(x) (as before, regarded via restriction K[x] ⊂ R). Since K[x]
is Noetherian, IM is an injective K[x]-module. Pick a splitting homomorphism α : M/IM → M for
this short exact sequence (considered now in K[x]-Mod.) We will call the pair (M, α) a weak splitting
pair. We deﬁne a category WSP whose objects are weak splitting pairs, and whose morphisms
ϕ : (M, α) → (N, β) are R-module homomorphisms ϕ : M → N such that Im(ϕ ◦ α) ⊂ Im β. It is
straightforward to note that this condition is equivalent to (the more natural condition) β◦ϕ = ϕ◦α.
Given a weak splitting pair π = (M, α), we have M = IM ⊕Im α as K[x]-modules. Note that left
multiplication by y leaves IM invariant, but for each m ∈ Im α, we must write ym = m1+m2, where
m1 ∈ IM and m2 ∈ Im α. Then m ∈ Im α and m = (xy)m = x(ym) = x(m1 + m2) = xm1 + xm2
implies that xm1 = 0 (and xm2 = x). We may then deﬁne a K-linear map ψe(π) : Im α → M0
as ψe(π)(m) = m1, where N0 is deﬁned for an arbitrary R-module N as the K[x]-socle of IN ,
i.e. N0 = {n ∈ N | xn = 0}.
If N ⊆ R, then N0 = N ∩ I0 in the notation from before. Let
ψf = ψf (π) : Im α → Im α be the left multiplication by x, and let Mu(π) = M0 and Mv(π) = Im α.
The data Ξ(π) = (Mu, Mv, ψe, ψf ) deﬁnes a representation of Γ in the notations from Section 1.

Theorem 5. (M, α) → Ξ(M, α) induces a functor Ξ : WSP → Rep(Γ). After corestriction, it
is a functor Ξ : WSP → LRep(Γ), where LRep(Γ) is the full subcategory of Rep(Γ) consisting of
representations with an invertible map on the loop f .

Proof. Given two weak splitting pairs π1 = (M, α) and π2 = (M, β) and a morphism ϕ : (M, α) →
(N, β) in WSP, we deﬁne Ξ(ϕ) as follows: deﬁne Ξ(ϕ)u : M0 → N0 and Ξ(ϕ)v : Im α → Im β to be
the restrictions of ϕ to their respective domains. Since ϕ is a morphism in WSP, these maps are well-
deﬁned. That Ξ(ϕ) is a morphism Ξ(π1) → Ξ(π2) is equivalent to Ξ(ϕ)u ◦ ψe(π1) = ψe(π2) ◦ Ξ(ϕ)v
and Ξ(ϕ)v ◦ ψf (π1) = ψf (π2) ◦ Ξ(ϕ)v. The latter equality is trivial, as Ξ(ϕ)v is K[x]-linear. The
former reduces to showing that (ϕ(m))1 = ϕ(m1) for all m ∈ Im α, in the notation deﬁning ψe
above. This is simple, since ϕ(m)1 + ϕ(m)2 = yϕ(m) = ϕ(ym) = ϕ(m1) + ϕ(m2) and ϕ(m1) ∈ N0,
ϕ2−→ π3 in WSP because
ϕ(m2) ∈ Im β. Finally we note that Ξ preserves compositions π1
the maps at u and v are simply restrictions of the ϕi’s. For the second statement, simply note
that Im α is a K[x]-module isomorphic to M/IM . But since left multiplication by x is invertible
on M/IM , ψf (π) must be invertible as well.

ϕ1−→ π2

If we start with an arbitrary ρ = (Mu, Mv, ψe, ψf ) in LRep(Γ), we may construct a weak
splitting pair (M, α) as follows: as a vector space, set M = (S1 ⊗K Mu) ⊕ Mv. Let x act on M
as x((rf1) ⊗ mu, mv) = ((xrf1) ⊗ mu, ψf (mv)), and y as y((rf1) ⊗ mu, mv) = ((yrf1) ⊗ mu + f1 ⊗
ψe(mv), ψ−1
f (mv)). It is then easy to check that for any m ∈ M , m = x(ym). We set α : Mv → M
to be the inclusion map. A morphism ϕ : (Mu, Mv, ψe, ψf ) → (M ′
f ) in LRep(Γ) induces
an R-module morphism Ψ(ϕ) = (idS1 ⊗ϕu) ⊕ ϕv : M (ρ) → M (ρ′) which satisﬁes Ψ(ϕ)(Mv) ⊂ M ′
v,
and under this construction morphisms in LRep(Γ) are preserved. In other words:

u, M ′

v, ψ′

e, ψ′

Theorem 6. The above construction induces a functor Ψ : LRep(Γ) → WSP. The functors Ξ and
Ψ induce an equivalence of categories WSP ∼= LRep(Γ).

Proof. Clearly Ψ(idρ) = idΨ(ρ) for any representation ρ, and Ψ(ϕ ◦ ϕ′) = (idS1 ⊗[ϕ ◦ ϕ′]u) ⊕ ([ϕ ◦

u) ⊕ ϕ′

ϕ′]v) = ((idS1 ⊗ϕu) ⊕ ϕv) ◦(cid:0)(idS1 ⊗ϕ′

v(cid:1) = Ψ(ϕ) ◦ Ψ(ϕ′), so Ψ is a functor. For the second,

we note that if π = (M, α) is given, then Ψ(Ξ(π)) = (S1 ⊗ M0) ⊕ Im α ∼= IM ⊕ Im α. Furthermore,
x(σ, a) = (xσ, ψf (π)a) = (xσ, xa) and y(σ, a) = (yσ + ψe(π)a, ψf (π)−1a) = (yσ + a1, ψf (π)−1a) =
(yσ + a1, a2), since a = xa2 and x is invertible in Im α. Clearly then, Ψ(Ξ(π)) ∼= π. The proof that
Ξ(Ψ(ρ)) ∼= ρ for all ρ ∈ LRep(Γ) works similarly. So Ψ and Ξ are inverses at the level of objects.
At the level of morphisms, [Ψ ◦ Ξ](ϕ) maps any m ∈ IM to ϕ(m), and any m ∈ Im α to ϕ(m).
But by the above argument, M ∼= (S1 ⊗ M0) ⊕ Im α and N ∼= (S1 ⊗ N0) ⊕ Im β naturally, so that
[Ψ ◦ Ξ](ϕ) = ϕ with the natural identiﬁcations. By a similar argument, [Ξ ◦ Ψ](ϕ) = ϕ.

Since there is a natural forgetful functor U : WSP → R-Mod deﬁned by U ((M, α)) = M
which is surjective on objects, one can see that we may realize R-Mod as a quotient category
of LRep(Γ) via the composition U ◦ Ψ : LRep(Γ) → R-Mod. Also, through the functor Ξ, it is
easy to see that objects (M, α) with M of ﬁnite length over R correspond to ﬁnite dimensional
Γ-representations. Moreover, the category LRep(Γ) is a category of modules: representations for
which f acts as an invertible element can be viewed as modules over the path algebra K[Γ] with
a relation making f invertible, i.e. K[Γ]hf −1i = K[Γ] ∗ K[W ]/hf W − 1, W f − 1i (of course, this
is not an admissible ideal in the sense of representation theory of ﬁnite dimensional algebras, but
we get an algebra nevertheless). Results of similar ﬂavor are given in [7] for arbitrary Leavitt
path algebras; our emphasis is again on the speciﬁc generators x, y. Although KΓ is known to be
of wild representation type, it is our hope that the above equivalence could be exploited to ﬁnd
new invariants for modules over the Jacobson algebra. It also opens up the possibility of studying
R-modules geometrically, via the representation variety of Γ.

3 The direct ﬁniteness conjecture and other outstanding problems

Strong motivation for gathering such representation-theoretic data comes from the Direct Finiteness
Conjecture. We brieﬂy gather here what is known on this as well as connections to other outstanding
problems. In [17], Kaplansky conjectured that if G is an arbitrary group and K is any ﬁeld, whenever
xy = 1 for x, y ∈ KG, then yx = 1 as well; that is, the group algebra is directly ﬁnite. In other
words, the Direct Finiteness Conjecture is equivalent to the claim that R does not embed in any
group algebras. An algebra A is said to be stably ﬁnite if all matrix algebras Mn(A) are directly
ﬁnite, and G is stably ﬁnite when KG is so. The direct ﬁniteness conjecture for groups is known
to be equivalent to the statement that every group is stably ﬁnite; also, G is stably ﬁnite if G × H
is directly ﬁnite for all H ([14]).

The Direct Finiteness Conjecture of Kaplansky is known to hold in characteristic zero by [19],
[17]. It was ﬁrst proved to also hold in characteristic p > 0 for a wide class of groups - namely, for
free-by-amenable groups - in [4]. Later, in [15] it was shown that this conjecture is true in arbitrary
characteristic for soﬁc groups - that is, groups that can be embedded into metric ultraproducts of
ﬁnite groups. Soﬁc groups were originally introduced by Gromov [16] motivated by an important
problem in symbolic dynamics known as Gottschalk’s surjunctivity conjecture (which he proved
to hold for this class of groups in [16]). This includes the result of [4]. In fact, as it turns out,

8

there are no known examples of non-soﬁc groups, and existence of soﬁc groups has become an
important problem. More recently, in [9], the conjecture is proved for {ﬁnitely generated residually
ﬁnite}-by-soﬁc groups; this class includes some groups for which it is currently not known whether
they are soﬁc or not.

On the other hand, this connection of the direct ﬁniteness conjecture has prompted interest
In [13] a class of
from researchers coming from other directions (operator theory):
ﬁnitely presented groups universal with respect to the direct ﬁniteness conjecture is introduced,

[9, 13, 14].

based on a computational idea: if ( Pi=1n

k

Pj=1

λigi)(

µjhj) = 1, then expanding and equating the two

sides, one obtains a series of relations of the type gihj = gkhl. This produces, for each pair (n, k)
a set of ﬁnitely many ﬁnitely presented groups, and the direct ﬁniteness conjecture is equivalent
to deciding direct ﬁniteness for group algebras of these groups. Computational conﬁrmation is
obtained then for this conjecture for special small values of (n, k) over the ﬁeld with two elements
F2 and the associated groups [13].

Finally, it is worth mentioning the connection with another class of groups, known as hyperlinear
groups. We refer to the the excellent surveys [10, 18, 23] for a history and state of the art of the
subject, and basic deﬁnitions. Brieﬂy, a hyperlinear group is a group that can be embedded into
metric ultraproduct of the n × n unitary groups U (n) over C. It is known that any soﬁc group is
hyperlinear, but no examples of hyperlinear and non-soﬁc groups are known, and also, no example
of non-hyperlinear groups is known. In fact, ﬁnding examples of groups that are not hyperlinear
is equivalent to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture for groups (by a result of Radulescu [18, 23]),
which is a central problem in mathematics and theoretical physics. This brings new light on direct
ﬁniteness: a counterexample would give the ﬁrst examples of non-soﬁc groups, a proof could be
considered further evidence for the Embedding Conjecture.

In fact, in view of these and of the method of [15], it is tempting to conjecture or at least ask

the following question

Question 1. Does every hyperlienar group satisfy the direct ﬁniteness conjecture?

In [15], the authors construct an embedding of a soﬁc group G into an (algebraic) ultraproduct
of ﬁnite matrix rings, which turns out to be a continuous von-Neumann regular ring, and so is
endowed with a tracial norm N with values in [0, 1] (pseudo-rank function). Then one can apply
the classical proof of characteristic 0 of Kaplanski [17] (von-Neumann algebras) or Montgomery [19]
(C ∗-algebras): if xy = 1, then yx is an idempotent; then 1 = N (xy) = N (yx) so N (1− yx) = 0; but
N (e) = 0 for an idempotent implies e = 0. This norm is constructed as a limit over the ultraﬁlter
of the normalized usual rank functions on the ﬁnite matrix rings. The embedding of G makes use
of partial maps f : F → Map(VF,ǫ) for ﬁnite subsets F of G and suitable ﬁnite sets VF,ǫ (coming
from the deﬁnition of soﬁc groups), which in turn are lifted to maps G → Mn(K) = End(KVF,ǫ).
This construction would still be possible if the set of partial maps is F → U (n) for unitary groups
(over C); the main hurdle here is that one would not have the liberty of introducing the coeﬃcients
in K, as the image of these partial maps are in Mn(C). Perhaps one way around this is to consider
the (ﬁnitely generated) subgroups generated by such images, and use Malcev’s theorem (they must
be residually ﬁnite) and try to use such ﬁnite pieces as in the maps above. However, at the same
time, it may be that such an attempt would be close to proving that a hyperlinear group is soﬁc,
which as mentioned, is an important problem in its own.

A possible strategy for direct ﬁniteness

Finally, we note a possible strategy approaching of the direct ﬁniteness of group algebras, based on
the properties of the Toeplitz algebra. If KG is not directly ﬁnite, then there is R ⊂ KG for x, y ∈ G
with xy = 1, yx 6= 1; moreover, there are many such copies of R, generated by pairs of elements
gR), and there is a ﬁltration of

(gxh−1, hyg1). In fact, as left (right) R-modules KG =Pg

Rg (=Pg

R-modules Σ ⊆ F ⊆ K[G] where Σ is the S-socle, F/Σ is locally ﬁnite and is the K[x, x−1]-torsion

9

part of K[G]/Σ, and K[G]/F is torsion free (over R and K[x, x−1]). Furthermore, this ﬁltration
is one of right ideals in K[G], and then G acts as automorphisms on Σ, F/Σ, K[G]/F (by right
multiplication). In view of the above technique involving splitting pairs, a possibly fruitful source
of information could be looking at the left-K[x] (and/or right K[y]-module) structure of K[G], as
there will be a large injective direct summand (coproduct of injective hulls of K[x]/(x)). Finally, not
discussed here, the R-bimodule structure of K[G] may yield new information, and so R-bimodules
[8] would become relevant as well.
