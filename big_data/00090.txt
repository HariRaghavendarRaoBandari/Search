The plasmoid instability in visco-resistive current sheets is analyzed in both the linear and non-
linear regimes. The linear growth rate and the wavenumber are found to scale as S 1/4(1 + Pm)−5/8
and S 3/8(1 + Pm)−3/16 with respect to the Lundquist number S and the magnetic Prandtl num-
ber Pm. Furthermore, the linear layer width is shown to scale as S−1/8(1 + Pm)1/16. The growth
of the plasmoids slows down from an exponential growth to an algebraic growth when they enter
into the nonlinear regime. In particular, the time-scale of the nonlinear growth of the plasmoids
is found to be τNL ∼ S−3/16(1 + Pm)19/32τA,L. The nonlinear growth of the plasmoids is radically
diﬀerent from the linear one and it is shown to be essential to understand the global current sheet
disruption. It is also discussed how the plasmoid instability enables fast magnetic reconnection in
visco-resistive plasmas. In particular, it is shown that the recursive plasmoid formation can trigger
a collisionless reconnection regime if S & Lcs(ǫclk)−1(1 + Pm)1/2, where Lcs is the half-length of the
global current sheet and lk is the relevant kinetic length scale. On the other hand, if the current
sheet remains in the collisional regime, the global (time-averaged) reconnection rate is shown to be
(cid:10) dψ/dt|X(cid:11) ≈ ǫcvA,uBu(1 + Pm)−1/2, where ǫc is the critical inverse aspect ratio of the current sheet,
while vA,u and Bu are the Alfv´en speed and the magnetic ﬁeld upstream of the global reconnection
layer.

I.

INTRODUCTION

During the last few years there have been great ad-
vances in understanding the nature and role of the plas-
moid instability [1], i.e., the instability of reconnecting
current sheets leading to the formation of secondary mag-
netic islands (plasmoids). Numerical simulations provid-
ing clear indications that thin reconnecting current sheets
may be unstable to the formation of secondary islands
date back at least to the mid-eighties [2–5], but it has
been only after a seminal paper by Loureiro and cowork-
ers [6] that the scientiﬁc community has begun to show
a distinct interest in the plasmoid instability and its ef-
fects on magnetic reconnection. In their paper, Loureiro
et al.
[6] presented a linear theory of the plasmoid in-
stability in Sweet-Parker current sheets, showing that
the growth rate and the wavenumber of the instability
scale as γmaxLcs/vA,u ∼ S1/4 and kmaxLcs ∼ S3/8, re-
spectively. Here, S is the Lundquist number based on
the half-length of the current sheet (Lcs) and the Alfv´en
speed upstream of the sheet (vA,u). This implies that
the linear growth of the plasmoids is surprisingly fast for
large values of the Lundquist number.

The eﬀects of the plasmoid instability on the magnetic
reconnection rate became clear shortly after Loureiro’s

∗Electronic address: lcomisso@princeton.edu

paper, when Bhattacharjee and coworkers [7] showed that
the predictions of the Sweet-Parker model [8] break down
for high-Lundquist-numbers as a consequence of the plas-
moid instability. The Sweet-Parker model gives a recon-
nection rate ∼ S−1/2vA,uBu, where Bu is the upstream
magnetic ﬁeld, but Bhattacharjee et al. [7] showed that
this cannot be valid for arbitrarily large S-values.
In
particular, they found from numerical simulations that
the reconnection rate becomes nearly independent on
the Lundquist number when the current sheet exceeds
a critical Lundquist number Sc. Note that the recon-
nection rate calculated by Bhattacharjee and coworkers
was averaged over time, since in the high-Lundquist-
number regime the reconnection process is strongly time-
dependent due to the continuous formation and ejec-
tion of plasmoids [7, 9, 10]. An estimation of the time-
averaged reconnection rate in this regime was proposed
by Huang and Bhattacharjee [11] as well as by Uzden-
sky and coworkers [12]. They showed that, as a result of
the plasmoid instability, the time-averaged reconnection
rate in statistical steady-state is ∼ 0.01vA,uBu, indepen-
dent of the Lundquist number and much higher than the
Sweet-Parker rate for very large S-values. These crucial
implications of the plasmoid instability caused a rethink-
ing of the traditional magnetic reconnection theory, with
a particular impetus for the investigation of the linear
properties of this instability [13–21] and its eﬀects on the
reconnection rate [22–32] and particle acceleration [33–
37].

In the present paper we have three main objectives.
First, we intend to generalize the linear analysis pre-
sented by Loureiro and coworkers [6] to non-negligible
values of the plasma viscosity. Then, we want to extend
the analysis of the plasmoid instability also to the nonlin-
ear regime. Finally, we aim to estimate the eﬀects of this
instability on the global reconnection rate. We point out
that for all these issues we will consider arbitrary values
of the magnetic Prandtl number.

The linear analysis will show that the plasmoid in-
stability remains fast also in the general case of non-
negligible plasma viscosity. This means that its rapid-
ity is a robust feature in the linear regime. However, we
must recall that the linear layer width has to be much
smaller than the current sheet width for the linear anal-
ysis to apply. Thus, one has to consider also the non-
linear regime to evaluate the overall growth rate of the
plasmoid instability. We will see that the growth of the
plasmoids slows down when their width becomes compa-
rable or larger than the linear layer width. In particular,
we will show how the time-scale of the plasmoid nonlin-
ear growth depends on the Lundquist number and the
magnatic Prandtl number.
It will also be shown that
the recursive plasmoid formation (due to the instability
of the secondary current sheets) may result in a speed
up of the global current sheet disruption. The break up
of the global current sheet has the eﬀect of accelerating
the magnetic reconnection process with respect to the
case of a current sheet that would remain stable for ar-
bitrary values of the Lundquist number. We will show
that for high-Lundquist-numbers the (time-averaged) re-
connection rate becomes independent of the Lundquist
number but not on the magnetic Prandtl number.
In
particular, the reconnection rate decreases for increasing
values of the magnetic Prandtl number. Finally, we will
see that plasma viscosity has also the eﬀect of increas-
ing the value of the global Lundquist number required to
trigger collisionless reconnection.

II. MODEL EQUATIONS AND EQUILIBRIUM

We consider the two-dimensional (∂z = 0) incompress-
ible MHD equations, which can be conveniently written
in terms of the magnetic ﬂux function ψ(x, y, t) and the
stream function φ(x, y, t) as [8]

∂tψ + v · ∇ψ = −ηj + E0 ,

∂tω + v · ∇ω = B · ∇j + ν∇2ω ,

where

B = ∇ψ × ez , v = ez × ∇φ
are the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds, while

j = −∇2ψ , ω = ∇2φ

(1)

(2)

(3)

are the electric current density and plasma vorticity, both
in the z direction. Furthermore, E0 is a constant of in-
tegration representing the equilibrium electric ﬁeld. The
mass density is assumed to be uniform and is normalized
such that ρ = 1. Lengths are normalized to a convenient
scale length L, magnetic ﬁeld to a convenient scale ﬁeld
strength B0, and time to the Alfv´en time τA = L/vA,
where vA is the Alfv´en speed based on B0. In this normal-
ization, the resistivity η and the viscosity ν are recipro-
cals of the Lundquist number and the (kinetic) Reynolds
number, respectively. Therefore, the ratio Pm = ν/η in-
dicates the magnetic Prandtl number.

We consider the equilibrium conﬁguration employed by
Loureiro et al. [6] in order to investigate the stability of a
Sweet-Parker type current sheet. As pointed out in their
landmark paper, this conﬁguration is not intended to re-
tain all the features of such a sheet, but only those which
may be regarded as the most important for its stability;
namely, a linearly increasing velocity in the ouﬂow direc-
tion and a sheared magnetic ﬁeld in the inﬂow direction.
Assuming an equilibrium ﬂow proﬁle v0 = (−Γ0x, Γ0y)
for |x| 6 x0 (inside the current sheet), v0 = (−Γ0x0, 0)
for x > x0, and v0 = (Γ0x0, 0) for x 6 −x0, the equilib-
rium stream function turns out to be

φ0(x, y) =


+Γ0xy ,
|x| 6 x0 ,
+Γ0x0y , x > x0 ,
−Γ0x0y , x 6 −x0 .

(5)

Here, Γ0 ≡ vd/Lcs is a constant velocity gradient, with
vd = v0y(0, Lcs) and Lcs indicating the downstream ve-
locity and the half-length of the current sheet, respec-
tively. In the presence of non-negligible viscosity eﬀects,
the force balance along the current sheet gives that [38]

vd = vA,u(1 + Pm)−1/2 ,

(6)

where vA,u is the Alfv´en speed upstream of the sheet.
The downstream velocity decreases as vd ≈ vA,uP −1/2
for Pm ≫ 1, while the standard Sweet-Parker result [8]
vd ≈ vA,u is recovered in the limit Pm ≪ 1. Also, mass
conservation for an incompressible ﬂow implies that the
upstream velocity is related to the downstream veloc-
ity and the aspect ratio of the current sheet as vu =
v0x(δcs, 0) = −vdδcs/Lcs, where [38]

m

δcs =(cid:18)η

Lcs

vd (cid:19)1/2

S1/2

(7)

is the characteristic half-width of the current sheet. Here,
S ≡ LcsvA,u/η is the Lundquist number based on the cur-
rent sheet length and the upstream Alfv´en speed. Again,
the standard Sweet-Parker width [8] δcs ≈ LcsS−1/2 is
recovered in the limit Pm ≪ 1, while the opposite limit
Pm ≫ 1 yields δcs ≈ LcsS−1/2P 1/4
m .
The equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld, which is assumed to
be in the form B0 = (0, B0y(x)), can be determined by
solving Eq.
(1) with ∂t = 0 and the equilibrium ﬂow

proﬁles already speciﬁed. In this case, Eq. (1) reduces
to

φ(x, y, t) = φ0(x, y) + φ1(x, t) eik(t)y ,

for |x| 6 x0. Introducing the new variable

ξ ≡

where ψ1 and φ1 are small perturbations to the equilib-
rium. As in Ref. [6], the wavenumber along the y direc-
tion is supposed to depend only on t, which is a valid as-
sumption if k varies suﬃciently slowly across the current
sheet [14]. Therefore, inside the current sheet (|x| 6 x0)
the perturbations ψ1 and φ1 satisfy the equations

(8)

(9)

and using B0y(0) = 0 as boundary condition, the solution
of Eq. (8) is

B0y ( ξ) = α e−ξ2/2r π

and

where

erﬁ (x) ≡ −i erf (ix) =

(11)

is the imaginary error function and α = E0/Γ0δcs.
Therefore, since for |x| > x0 (outside the current sheet)
the magnetic ﬁeld is constant by virtue of Eq.
(1)
and the speciﬁed equilibrium ﬂow proﬁles, we can write
Loureiro’s 1-D equilibrium [6] as

B0y (ξ) =

−1 ,

|ξ| 6 ξ0 ,
ξ > ξ0 ,
ξ 6 −ξ0 .

(12)

Here, ξ0 ≡ x0/δcs and the normalizing magnetic ﬁeld
strength is chosen to be the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld
at ξ = ξ0. The value of the constant α can be spec-
iﬁed by matching the magnetic ﬁeld inside the current
sheet (|ξ| 6 ξ0) with the magnetic ﬁeld outside the cur-
rent sheet (|ξ| > ξ0). Logical matching points ±ξ0 are
where the solution of Eq. (8) has its maximum and its
minimum, i.e., where the current density vanishes. These
points correspond to ±ξ0 = ±1.307. Therefore, requiring
B0y(±ξ0) = ±1 yields α = 1.307.

III. LINEAR THEORY

We now show that the presented equilibrium is prone
to the visco-resistive plasmoid instability. To this pur-
pose, diﬀerently from Ref.
[6], we perform a boundary
layer theory that takes into account both plasma resis-
tivity and viscosity.

A. Linearized equations

(15)

x − k2(cid:1) ψ1

−ikB0y(cid:0)∂2

x − k2(cid:1) φ1
d2B0y
dx2 ψ1
x + k4(cid:1) φ1 .(16)

These equations depend on both x and y. However, the
y-dependence can be removed by choosing k(t) to satisfy
∂tk + Γ0k = 0 inside the current sheet. This gives that
k(t) = k0e−Γ0t [6], and the above equations reduce to

x − k2(cid:1) ψ1 ,

∂tψ1 + ikB0yφ1 − Γ0x∂xψ1 = η(cid:0)∂2
∂t(cid:0)∂2

x − k2(cid:1) φ1 + 2Γ0k2φ1 − Γ0x∂x(cid:0)∂2

dx2 − B0y(cid:0)∂2
x + k4(cid:1) φ1 .
x − 2k2∂2

x − k2(cid:1) φ1

(17)

(18)

Actually, in our analysis we can ignore also the time-
dependence of k since we look for fast growing modes
[6, 14]. Alternatively, we could have started directly with
a time-independent k, but we have adopted this approach
to illustrate the domain of validity of the const-k approx-
imation. In particular, we search for solutions of the form

ψ1(x, t) = Ψ(x)eγt , φ1(x, t) = −iΦ(x)eγt ,

(19)

with growth rate

γ ≫

vd
Lcs ≡ Γ0 .

(20)

Indeed, in order for a tearing mode to grow it is necessary
that its growth rate exceeds the shearing rate [8, 39]. In
this limit, k(t) ≈ k0 and the terms proportional to Γ0
can be neglected. Therefore, the linear shear ﬂow con-
tributes only via the equilibrium proﬁle B0y(x) [6]. Un-
der these approximations, and with the change of vari-
able ξ ≡ x/δcs, the equations that govern the perturbed
quantities Ψ(ξ) and Φ(ξ) are

We start by linearizing Eqs. (1) and (2) according to

ψ(x, y, t) = ψ0(x) + ψ1(x, t) eik(t)y ,

(23)

We recall that ǫ ≪ 1, since we are considering highly

elongated current sheets. Furthermore, we assume

but also

λ ≪ 1 ,

κ ≫ 1 ,

κǫ ≪ 1 ,

λ ≫ κ−1(1 + Pm)−1/2 ,

(24)

(25)

since we are looking for perturbations such that γ ≫ Γ0.
All these assumptions are satisﬁed by the fastest growing
mode, as can be veriﬁed a posteriori. Then, as in tearing
mode theory, the problem can be made more tractable by
dividing the spatial domain into two regions: an “outer
region” (|ξ| & 1), where non-ideal eﬀects and plasma in-
ertia are negligible, and a thin “inner region” (|ξ| ≪ 1)
centered on the resonant surface at x = 0, where resis-
tivity, viscosity, and plasma inertia can be important.

B. Outer region

In the region |ξ| ∼ 1, neglecting plasma inertia and

non-ideal eﬀects, Eq. (21) reduces to

Φ = −

while Eq. (22) becomes

(26)

(27)

Eq. (27) can be solved perturbatively by exploiting the
smallness of κ2ǫ2, as it has been done by Loureiro et al.
[6]. Its solution can be written as

Ψ± (ξ) = C ±

where ± refers to the solution at ξ ≷ 0. The constants
of integration C ±
2 can be found by requiring the solu-
tion to be continuous across the rational surface ξ = 0
and adopting the approximation B0y(ξ) ≈ αξ for small
ξ. This gives that C+
2 = −αΨ(0). The integra-
tion constants C ±
1 can instead be found by matching the
solution (28) with the solution of Eq. (27) in the region
|ξ| > ξ0, which is Ψ± (ξ) = C ±
3 e∓κǫξ. Matching this solu-
tion and its ﬁrst derivative with the solution (28) and its

2 = C −

ﬁrst derivative at ξ = ±ξ0 yields C ±
1 = ±αΨ(0)/κǫ and
C ±
3 = (αΨ(0)/κǫ) eκǫξ0. Therefore, the ideal-MHD mag-
netic ﬂux eigenfunction for Loureiro’s 1-D equilibrium is

This solution has a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative at the
rational surface ξ = 0. In particular, the jump in its ﬁrst
derivative gives the tearing stability parameter [6, 40]

In the following, as in the standard tearing mode the-
ory, we will perform a matching between the solutions in
the outer and inner regions by means of the parameter
∆′. Note that while the expression (30) is the same as
in Loureiro et al.
[6], here the inverse aspect ratio of
the current sheet ǫ depends not only on the Lundquist
number S but also on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm.

C.

Inner region

In the region |ξ| ≪ 1 we can assume κ2ǫ2 ≪ d2/dξ2
and B0y ≈ αξ. Therefore, Eqs. (21) and (22) reduce to

(33)

which should be understood in a generalized sense [41],
since Ψ (ξ) and Φ (ξ) are not square integrable. Then, the

to give the layer equation

for

In the limit Pm ≪ 1, the eigenvalue problem (34)-(36)

yields the dispersion relation [6, 42]

Λ5/4 Γ(cid:2)(cid:0)Λ3/2 − 1(cid:1) /4(cid:3)

where Λ ≡ α−2/3κ1/3λ and Γ indicates the gamma func-

who found the growth rate and the wavenumber of the
fastest growing mode by balancing two relevant limits of
Eq. (37), namely

λ =(cid:20) Γ (1/4)

2πΓ (3/4)(cid:21)4/5

and

for Λ ≪ 1 ,

(38)

(39)

λ = α2/3κ−1/3 −

for Λ → 1− .

In this way, they showed that for the fastest growing
mode γmaxLcs/vA,u ∼ S1/4 and kmaxLcs ∼ S3/8.
Here, on the other hand, we are interested also in plas-
mas with non-negligible viscosity. In the case Pm > 1 an
exact analytic solution of the layer equation (34) has not
been found, but we can rely on analytic approximations
that are valid in diﬀerent relevant asymptotic regimes
[45].

We ﬁrst consider the small-∆′ regime, which is char-
acterized by the condition ∆′δin ≪ 1, with δin indicat-
ing the inner layer width. In this case, Eq. (34) can be
solved by asymptotic matching the solutions obtained for
large θ and relatively small θ. For values of θ such that
θ > (λκ)1/2P 1/4

m , Eq. (34) may be approximated as

d2 ˆΦ>
dθ2 −

ˆΦ> = 0 ,

(40)

where ˆΦ>(θ) indicates the function that approximate
ˆΦ(θ) in the considered interval. The general solution of
this equation is [31]

(41)
where I1/6 and K1/6 are the modiﬁed Bessel functions
of the ﬁrst and second kind of order 1/6, C4 and C5 are
integration constants, and δin = (ακ)−1/3. On the other
hand, if we consider values of θ such that θ < (ακ)1/3,
Eq. (34) may be approximated as

5

where ˆΦ<(θ) indicates the function that approximate
ˆΦ(θ) for relatively small values of θ. The general solution
of this equation is

ˆΦ< = C6(cid:18)−

λ

where C6 and C7 are integration constants.
Imposing
the boundary conditions (35) and (36) and matching
the functions ˆΦ> and ˆΦ< in the overlapping interval
(λκ)1/2P 1/4

m < θ < (ακ)1/3, we can ﬁnally obtain

(45)

We now turn our attention to the large-∆′ regime
(∆′ → ∞).
In this case, we can assume the “visco-
resistive” ordering, for which all terms in Eq. (34) are
comparable over the entire width of the inner layer, with
the exception of the inertial term, which is taken to be
negligible [45]. With this ordering, estimating θ ∼ 1/δin
and d/dθ ∼ δin, we obtain

and

δin ∼ (ακ)−1/3

A more precise multiplicative constant can be found

D. Fastest growing mode

The most unstable mode, which is the one that domi-
nates the plasmoids growth, occurs at the intersection of
the small-∆′ and large-∆′ regimes. Therefore, by equat-
ing Eqs. (44) and (48), with the help of Eq. (30), we ﬁnd
the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode

From this relation we have also the number of plasmoids

Note that plasma viscosity has the eﬀect of decreasing
the growth rate and the wavenumber of the plasmoid
instability, while it increases (slightly) the inner layer
width. We observe that the same dependence of κmax,
γmax and δin,max on S and Pm was found in a heuris-
tic way by Loureiro and coworkers [17]. Their scalings
were obtained (non-rigorously) by applying the classical
tearing mode expressions for large Pm [45] to a Harris
current sheet with equilibrium scale length L ≡ δcs ≈

tacharjee et al. [7] to reproduce the scaling relations de-

rived by Loureiro et al.
Here, instead, we have adopted a more rigorous approach
that conﬁrms the S and Pm dependencies and gives us the
remaining multiplicative factors. Moreover, we observe
that since the relations (49)-(52) for high-Pm plasmas
have the same α factors and S dependencies of those re-
sulting from Eqs. (38)-(39) for low-Pm plasmas, general
relations for arbitrary Pm can be represented as

(55)

It is clear that, despite the damping eﬀect of the
plasma viscosity, the plasmoid instability turns out to be
super-Alfv´enic in plasmas of interest to this work, i.e.,
for very large S-values. Note that the growth rate of
the plasmoid instability is super-Alfv´enic with respect
to the inverse Alfv´en time τA,L = Lcs/vA,u (along the
current sheet), but it is slower than the inverse Alfv´en
time τA,δ = δcs/vA,u (transverse to the current sheet),
as is required for the tearing mode analysis. It should
also be noted that while the decrease of the growth rate

6

with increasing magnetic Prandtl number may occur as
a dissipative eﬀect of viscosity, it is also possible for a
stable current sheet to be destabilized by the viscosity in
analogy to what happens for the Orr-Sommerfeld equa-
tion in ﬂuid dynamics. The plasma viscosity may indeed
destabilize the stable branches of the dispersion relation
that follows from Eqs. (21) and (22). For this reason, we
believe that a treatment of the role of viscosity on the
eﬀects of marginal stability is warranted.

It

is easy to verify that

the obtained relations
(53)-(55) for the fastest growing mode justify the
assumptions adopted to derive these relations,
i.e.,
κ−1
max(1 + Pm)−1/2 ≪ λmax ≪ 1, 1/κmax ≪ 1, and
κmaxǫ ≪ 1 (recall that ǫ = S−1/2(1 + Pm)1/4 ≪ 1 since
we are considering highly elongated current sheets).
Furthermore, if we suppose that the stabilizing eﬀect of
the ﬂow becomes ineﬀective for current sheets exceeding
the critical aspect ratio Lc/δc ≡ 1/ǫc, it is straightfor-
ward to see that

Sc = ǫ−2

c (1 + Pm)1/2 ,

(56)

i.e., the critical Lundquist number for the stability of the
sheet increases with increasing plasma viscosity due to
the reduction of the outﬂow velocity [31, 62]. In particu-
lar, in the limit Pm ≪ 1 we get Sc ≈ ǫ−2
[7, 10], whereas
c P 1/2
in the limit Pm ≫ 1 it follows that Sc ≈ ǫ−2
m , which
agrees with the condition proposed by Loureiro et al.
[17].

IV. NONLINEAR THEORY

The previous linear analysis breaks down and non-
linearities must be considered when the plasmoid chain
width w grows to a size comparable or exceeding the
linear layer width δin,max. Then, in order to determine
the nonlinear evolution of the plasmoids, we have to
consider the relevant nonlinear regime that characterizes
their growth.

A. Nonlinear evolution

To ascertain the proper nonlinear regime, we observe

that for the fastest growing mode

∆′
maxδcs ≈

2α2
κmaxǫ ∼

2α3/4S1/8
(1 + Pm)1/16 ,

(57)

while the plasmoid half-width is w ∼ δin,max at the be-
ginning of the nonlinear evolution. Therefore, when the
fastest growing mode enters into the nonlinear regime

∆′
maxw ∼ 1

(58)

(ignoring a factor 2), which implies that the plasmoids
evolve nonlinearly according to a Waelbroeck regime [47]

maxw & 1) instead of a Rutherford one [48] (∆′

(∆′
maxw ≪
1). This means that the inter-plasmoids X-points col-
lapse to form thin inter-plasmoids current sheets soon
after entering the nonlinear regime.

The nonlinear growth of the plasmoids can be deter-
mined by matching a model of magnetic reconnection
within current sheets with Waelbroeck’s solution for the
magnetic conﬁguration of rapidly reconnecting islands
[49]. In this case, the temporal rate of change of magnetic
ﬂux at the separatrix of a plasmoid can be evaluated as

dψs

,

(59)

where B∗
y is the magnetic ﬁeld upstream of the inter-
plasmoids current sheet and δ∗
cs is the half-width of this
sheet. Considering Eq. (7) for the case of the secondary
reconnecting current sheet, we can estimate δ∗
cs to obtain
[38]

(60)

The time scale of the magnetic ﬂux change across the

inter-plasmoid layer is

τψ =

dψs/dt ≈

,

(61)

which is much larger than the transverse Alfv´en time
τA,δ = δcs/vA,u. Hence, outside the singular layer,
the magnetic conﬁguration proceeds through a sequence
of MHD equilibria. Furthermore, in this regime τψ is
smaller than the characteristic time for current diﬀusion,
the plasmoid skin time τw = w2/η. This implies that
the ﬂux becomes frozen-in and the magnetic helicity is
conserved within pairs of ﬂux tubes [49, 50]. We can
therefore consider Waelbroeck’s solution for rapidly re-
connecting islands [49, 51], which tells us that the plas-
moids become self-similar as w grows for w ≫ 1/∆′
max
(and w < δcs), with a plasmoid magnetic conﬁguration

moids depends on the Lundquist and magnetic Prandtl
numbers. In the case of negligible plasma viscosity, this

relation reduces simply to w/δcs ∼ α9/4
It is important to point out that since γmaxτA,L ∝
S1/4 and δin,max/δcs ∝ S−1/8, in high-Lundquist-number
systems the plasmoids spend an extremely short period
of time in the linear regime. It is therefore the nonlinear
regime that sets out the time scale for the disruption of
the current sheet. From Eq. (65) we can see that w ∼ δcs
on the time scale

τN L ∼ S−3/16(1 + Pm)19/32τA,L .

(66)

Therefore, the time scale for the current sheet disrup-
tion decreases with increasing Lundquist number but in-
creases with increasing magnetic Prandtl number.

It should be noted that for extremely large S-values
also the secondary current sheets connecting the plas-
moids may themselves be subject to the plasmoid insta-
bility if

The same reasoning can be applied to the tertiary current
sheets connecting the secondary plasmoids, and so forth.
This fractal-like cascade process [52] towards smaller
scales ends when the (n)th current sheets are suﬃciently
thick to avoid the plasmoid instability. Therefore, using
S(n) ∼ Sc one can ﬁnd that, after the linear growth, the
plasmoids separated by the (n)th current sheets destroy
the (n − 1)th current sheets on the nonlinear time-scale

Therefore, the growth of the plasmoids slows down from

This sets oﬀ a “domino eﬀect” that speeds up the disrup-
tion of the global current sheet, which, in turn, allows for
a very rapid release of magnetic energy.

B.

Implications for fast magnetic reconnection

Plasmoids have a great impact on the global recon-
nection rate if they grow to a size w & δcs before being
expelled from the global current sheet. In this case, the
global current sheet breaks up and is replaced by a chain
of plasmoids of diﬀerent sizes separated by smaller cur-
rent sheets [7, 12, 24, 52, 53]. In a plasmoid-dominated

reconnection layer the dynamics can be particularly com-
plex, with plasmoids constantly being generated, ejected
and merging with each other. This leads to a strongly
time-dependent reconnection process. However, we may
expect this process to reach a statistical steady state
with a marginally stable current sheet located at the
main X-point. The statistical steady state expectation
is supported by many numerical simulations from diﬀer-
ent research groups [7, 10, 11, 24, 25, 28, 31, 33, 54–
56]. The supposition of a marginally stable current sheet
at the main X-point is also well-founded.
Indeed, the
fractal-like cascade process towards smaller scales due to
the plasmoid instability ends when the length of the ﬁ-
nal local current layer is shorter that the critical length
Lc. Also, the local current sheet at the main X-point is
continuously stretched by the plasmoids moving in the
outﬂow direction, thereby being regularly subject to the
plasmoid instability every time its length exceeds Lc.
Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the length of the
local current sheet at the main X-point should always be
quite close to Lc.

We can evaluate the global reconnection rate in the
plasmoid-dominated regime as the rate of change of the
magnetic ﬂux reconnected at the main X-point [12]. This
is because only the open-ﬂux parcels matter when cal-
culating the total reconnection rate, and summing and
subtracting the contributions of all the reconnection lay-
ers one can ﬁnd that the global reconnection rate is
given only by the reconnection region at the main X-
point. Therefore, the reconnection rate in statistical
steady state can be calculated as

By

[11, 12] and Pm ≫ 1 (h dψ/dt|Xi ≈ ǫcvA,uBuP −1/2

to arbitrary magnetic Prandtl numbers. Note that the
statistical steady-state reconnection rate in the plasmoid-
dominated regime becomes nearly independent of the
microscopic plasma parameters only for low magnetic
Prandtl numbers. For large magnetic Prandtl numbers
this behavior changes because the viscous energy dissi-
pation leads to a decrease of the outﬂow velocity.

Finally, it is important to point out that the plasmoid
instability may also lead to an even faster reconnection
regime by triggering a transition to collisionless reconnec-
tion [9, 12, 22, 23, 63]. Indeed, the fractal-like cascade
process caused by the plasmoid istability produces local
reconnection layers that may be in the collisionless regime
even if the initial global current sheet is collisional, i.e.,
even if δcs ≫ lk, being lk a relevant kinetic length scale.
This transition occurs if δc . lk. Therefore, by rewriting
Eq. (70) as δc ≈ Lcs(1 + Pm)1/4(Sc/S2)1/2, we ﬁnd that
the plasmoid instability leads to the collisionless regime
if

S &

Lcs
ǫclk

(1 + Pm)1/2 .

(72)

This relation exhibits a signiﬁcant dependence on the
magnetic Prandtl number, which has the eﬀect of in-
creasing the value of the global Lundquist number re-
quired to reach the collisionless regime. Note also that
the relevant kinetic length scale lk depends on the value
of the out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of negligi-
ble guide magnetic ﬁeld lk = di (see, e.g., [64–66]), being
di = c/ωpi the ion skin depth, while in the opposite case
of strong guide magnetic ﬁeld lk = ρτ (see, e.g., [67–
69]), where ρτ = cs/ωci represents the ion sound Larmor
radius based on both the electron and ion temperatures.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Using the global reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld Bu as an
estimation of By upstream of the current sheet at the
main X-point, it follows that the local downstream ve-
locity can be written as vd = vA,u(1 + Pm)−1/2. Furter-
more, using Eq. (56) for the critical Lundquist number,
the reconnection rate in statistical steady state becomes
simply

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X(cid:29) ≈ ǫc
(cid:28) dψ

vA,uBu

(1 + Pm)1/2 .

(71)

Note that numerical simulations [4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 22, 24,
57–60] indicate 1/ǫc ∼ 102, implying that the plasmoid-
dominated regime is a fast reconnection regime provided
that Pm is not too high, as it could be in some astrophys-
ical environments like the warm interstellar medium and
protogalactic plasmas [61].

Expression (71), ﬁrst obtained in Ref. [31], extends the
expressions valid for Pm ≪ 1 (h dψ/dt|Xi ≈ ǫcvA,uBu)

In this paper we have presented a theory of the plas-
moid instability in visco-resistive plasmas, i.e., plasmas
in which both resistivity and viscosity are important. We
have considered both the linear and nonlinear regimes of
the plasmoid instability, and we have also evaluated its
eﬀects on the global reconnection rate.

The linear analysis presented here generalizes the
[6]
theoretical work performed by Loureiro et al.
to account for non-negligible values of plasma viscos-
ity. The linear growth rate and the wavenumber of
the visco-resistive plasmoid instability are found to
be γmaxτA,L ∼ α3/2S1/4(1 + Pm)−5/8 and kmaxLcs ∼
α5/4S3/8(1 + Pm)−3/16, respectively. Therefore, plasma
viscosity has the eﬀect of decreasing the linear growth
rate and the wavenumber of the instability. However,
despite its damping eﬀect, for very high Lundquist num-
bers the plasmoid instability turns out to be very rapid
(super-Alfv´enic) in the linear regime.

Nonlinearities begin to be important when the width
of the plasmoids becomes of the order of the lin-

ear layer width, which is found to be δin,max/δcs ∼
α−3/4S−1/8(1 + Pm)1/16.
Since δin,max/δcs decreases
with increasing Lundquist number, the nonlinear growth
of the plasmoids turns out to be fundamental in set-
ting out the time-scale for the disruption of high-S cur-
rent sheets. For w ≫ 1/∆′
max (soon after the be-
ginning of the nonlinear regime) we have found that
the half-width of the plasmoids grows as w/δcs ∼
α9/4
16 S3/8(1 + Pm)−19/16(t/τA,L)2. Therefore, the growth
of the plasmoids slows down from the exponential growth
of the linear regime to an algebraic growth characterized
by a time scale τN L ∼ S−3/16(1 + Pm)19/32τA,L. For
extremely large Lundquist numbers, a fractal-like cur-
rent sheet structure with hierarchical plasmoid chains can
speed up the growth of the larger plasmoids and conse-
quently also the destruction of the global current sheet.
Finally, we have shown that also in visco-resistive plas-
mas the plasmoid instability is pivotal in allowing fast
magnetic reconnection.
In particular, we have calcu-
lated that the reconnection rate in statistical steady-

9

state is h dψ/dt|Xi ≈ ǫcvA,uBu(1 + Pm)−1/2,
indepen-
dent of the Lundquist number but not on the mag-
netic Prandtl number. For not excessively high Pm-
values, the reconnection rate is fast, i.e., a signiﬁcant
fraction of the out-of-plane electric ﬁeld evaluated up-
stream of the global reconnection layer. We have also
shown that the plasmoid instability may allow fast recon-
nection by leading to a collisionless reconnection regime
if S & Lcs(ǫclk)−1(1 + Pm)1/2.
