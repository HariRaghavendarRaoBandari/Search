Abstract

Let G be a virtually cyclic of the form (Za ⋊ Zb) ⋊ Z or [Za ⋊ (Zb ×
Q2i )]⋊Z. We compute the integral cohomology ring of G, and then obtain
the periodicity of the Farell cohomology of these groups.

Keywords: periodic groups, cohomology ring, Farrell cohomology

1 Introduction

Virtually cyclic groups can be considered the simplest family of groups which
contains both the inﬁnite groups and the ﬁnite ones. They play an important
role in several subjects, like the Fibered Isomorphism conjecture by Farrel and
Jones, see [6], and the study of space forms of inﬁnite discrete groups. The
space forms for ﬁnite groups have been widely studied and, in the similar prob-
lem for inﬁnite discrete groups, the simplest case to consider is the one where
the groups are virtually cyclic. The structure of the cohomology ring of these
groups is an interesting question in its own right and very useful for the study
of the space forms.
In more detail, consider, for the inﬁnite virtually cyclic
groups, the problem of deciding which ones act on homotopy spheres, as well
the classiﬁcation of the homotopy type of the orbit spaces.

For results about space forms, mostly for ﬁnite groups and a few inﬁnite
groups, see for example [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] [14], [16], [17] and [8]. In partic-
ular, for the special question of which virtually cyclic groups act on homotopy
spheres, the answer has been given in [8]. For the classiﬁcation of the homotopy

type of the orbit spaces the cohomology ring of the group plays an important
role.

The goal of this work is to describe the ring structure of two families of

virtually cyclic groups, namely (Za ⋊ Zb) ⋊ Z and [Za ⋊ (Zb × Q2i)] ⋊ Z.

The main results of this work are Theorems 3.3, 4.9 and 4.10. Besides de-
scribing the cohomology ring structure of these groups with integral coeﬃcients,
we also determine explicitly the cohomology class which determine the period-
icity (in the sense of [4, Section X.6]).

This work contains 3 sections besides the introduction.

In section 2 we
present the basic tools about the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
which is going to be used later. In section 3 we use section 2 for our ﬁrst family
of groups to obtain the main result which is Theorem 3.3. Section 4 we use
section 2 for our second family of groups to obtain the main results which are
Theorems 4.9 and 4.10.

2 Preliminaries

Given an exact sequence of groups

1

H

G

Q

1,

(1)

the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence in cohomology is such that

Ep,q

2 = H p(Q; H q(H; M )) =⇒ H p+q(G; M )

for any G-module M . In this paper our main interest is in groups of the form
F ⋊θ Z, in which case the above spectral sequence gives us the following result
for M = Z:

Lemma 2.1. For each positive integer n, there is an exact sequence

0

H n−1(F ; Z)Z

H n(F ⋊θ Z; Z)

H n(F ; Z)Z

0.

Proof. Since H n(Z; M ) = 0 if n ≥ 2, the spectral sequence associated to the
extension

F

F ⋊θ Z

Z

is such that Ep,q
each n ≥ 1 the exact sequence

2 = 0 for p ≥ 2, hence Ep,q

2 = Ep,q

∞ for all p, q and we get for

0

E1,n−1

2

H n(F ⋊θ Z; Z)

E0,n

0.

Cohomology of virtually cyclic groups

On the other hand,

E0,n
E1,n−1

2 = H 0(Z; H n(F ; Z)) = H n(F ; Z)Z

and
= H 1(Z; H n−1(F ; Z)) = H n−1(F ; Z)Z,

2

so the result follows.

Corollary 2.2. If F is a ﬁnite group with periodic cohomology, then H n(F ⋊θ
Z; Z) ∼= H n(F ; Z)Z for n even and H n(F ⋊θ Z; Z) ∼= H n−1(F ; Z)Z for n odd.

Proof. The result follows from the above Lemma and the fact that a ﬁnite
group with periodic cohomology has trivial odd dimensional integral cohomology
groups [4, Section VI.9, exercise 4, page 159].

The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence can be constructed in a
purely algebraic manner, but it can also be given a topological interpretation:
the extension (1) gives rise to a ﬁbration sequence

K(H, 1)

K(G, 1)

K(Q, 1)

and the resulting Leray-Serre spectral sequence is exactly the Lyndon-Hochs-
child-Serre sequence (see [1]). Theorem 5.2 of [19] can now be applied to show
that, on the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, the cup product ⌣
and the product ·2 on E2 are related by

u ·2 v = (−1)pq′

(u ⌣ v)

(2)

2

2

and v ∈ Ep′,q′

for u ∈ Ep,q
. Depending on the properties of E2, this equation
may be enough to recover the cohomology ring H ∗(G; Z) from the Lyndon-
Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence in cohomology. For instance, if F is a ﬁnite
group with periodic cohomology, the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre with Z coeﬃ-
cients applied to the extension

1

F

F ⋊θ Z

Z

1

is such that Ep,q
E2 gives us the cup product in H ∗(F ⋊θ Z; Z).

2 = 0 if p ≥ 2 or if q is odd, so Ep,q

2 = Ep,q

∞ and the product on

Now we make some remarks about the periodicity of the cohomology of
(F ⋊θ Z):
if F is a ﬁnite group with periodic cohomology, then F ⋊θ Z has
periodic Farrell cohomology. This follows from [4, Theorem X.6.7, item (iii)],
since a ﬁnite subgroup of F ⋊θZ is actually a subgroup of F ×{0} ∼= F . Moreover,
vcd(F ⋊θ Z) = 1 implies ˆH i(F ⋊θ Z; M ) ∼= H i(F ⋊θ Z; M ) for all i ≥ 2 and
every (F ⋊θ Z)-module M , where ˆH ∗ denotes the Farrell cohomology. Finally,
we know that the cup product in the Farrell cohomology is compatible with the
regular cup product [4, Section X.3], hence we have the following result:

Theorem 2.3. Let F be a ﬁnite group with periodic cohomology.
positive integer and u ∈ H d(F ⋊θ Z; Z) is a cohomology class such that

If d is a

(u ⌣ ) : H i(F ⋊θ Z; M ) → H i+d(F ⋊θ Z; M )

is an isomorphism for all i ≥ 2 and every (F ⋊θ Z)-module M , then

(ˆu ⌣ ) : ˆH i(F ⋊θ Z; M ) → ˆH i+d(F ⋊θ Z; M )

is an isomorphism for all i ∈ Z and every (F ⋊θ Z)-module M , where ˆu denotes
∼=→ ˆH d(F ⋊θ
the image of u under the canonical isomorphism H d(F ⋊θ Z; M )
Z; M ).

3 The cohomology ring of (Za ⋊ Zb) ⋊ Z

Let a and b be relatively prime integers and let G be the group (Za ⋊α Zb) ⋊θ Z,
where α : Zb → Aut(Za) is given by α(1b)(1a) = r · 1a with gcd(a, (r − 1)b) = 1
and rb ≡ 1 (mod a), and θ : Z → Aut(Za ⋊α Zb) is given by θ(1)(1a) = ca · 1a
and θ(1)(1b) = c · 1a + cb · 1b. See [11] for more details on the integers c, ca and
cb.

The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence in cohomology (with Z co-

eﬃcients) associated to the exact sequence of groups

1

Za

(Za ⋊α Zb)

Zb

is such that Ep,q
2 = H p(Zb; H q(Za; Z)). The group Zb acts trivially on H 0(Za; Z)
and acts on H 2(Za; Z) by multiplication by r. Since the cohomology ring
H ∗(Za; Z) is given by

Z[α2]

(aα2 = 0)

with dim(α2) = 2, it follows that Zb acts on H 2j(Za; Z) by multiplication by
rj. Hence Ep,q
is possibly non-null only if p and q are even and pq = 0 and it
follows that

if p = q = 0,
if p = 0 and q = 2i > 0,
if q = 0 and p > 0 is even,
otherwise,

where δi = gcd(ri − 1, a). Since a and b are relatively prime, so are δi and b,
and we have proved the following:

Proposition 3.1. The integral cohomology groups of (Za ⋊α Zb), with α(1b) =
r · 1a, are given by

H n(Za ⋊α Zb; Z) =

Z,
Zδi ⊕ Zb ∼= Zδib,

if n = 0,
if n = 2i > 0,
if n is odd.

We will now compute the cohomology groups H ∗(G; Z), and in order to do

that we need some simple facts and some notation.

If a cyclic group H acts on the ﬁnite cyclic group Zk, then it is straightfor-
ward to check that (Zk)H ∼= (Zk)H , hence H n(G; Z) ∼= H n+1(G; Z) if n ≥ 2 is
even.

The action of Z on H 0(Za ⋊α Zb; Z) is trivial, so H 0(G; Z) ∼= H 1(G; Z) ∼= Z.

Also, noticing that Aut(Zδi ⊕ Zb) = Aut(Zδi ) ⊕ Aut(Zb), if we write

H 2i(Za ⋊α Zb; Z) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z)) ⊕ H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z)) ∼= Zδi ⊕ Zb,

then the action of 1 ∈ Z on H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z)) is the multiplication by ci
a on Zδi
and the action of 1 ∈ Z on H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z)) is the multiplication by ci
b on Zb,
where the integers ca and cb come from the deﬁnition of θ : Z → Aut(Za ⋊α Zb)
as

θ(1)(1a) = ca · 1a

and θ(1)(1b) = c · 1 + cb · 1b,

as we mentioned in the beginning of this section. Therefore, if we deﬁne Aj =
gcd(cj
b − 1, b), we have the following
result:

a − 1, δi) for i ≡ j (mod d) and Bj = gcd(cj

Theorem 3.2. The integral cohomology groups of G = (Za ⋊α Zb) ⋊θ Z are
given by

H n(G; Z) =(Z,

ZAj ⊕ ZBj ,

if n = 0 or n = 1,
if n = 2j or n = 2j + 1 (and j > 0).

Proof. From Corollary 2.2 we have

H n(G; Z) =(H n(Za ⋊α Zb; Z)Z,

H n−1(Za ⋊α Zb; Z)Z,

if n is even,
if n is odd.

Using the Proposition 3.1 and the notation introduced above, the result follows.

In order to determine the multiplicative structure in H ∗(G; Z), we need
representatives for the generating classes of each cohomology group H n(G; Z).
For n = 0, let us denote the generating class by 1. For n = 1, a representative
for the generating class of

H 1(Z; H 0(Za ⋊α Zb; Z)) ∼= Z

is the map η : Z[Za ⋊α Zb] → Z of Z[Za ⋊α Zb]-modules given by η(1) = 1. More
precisely, if ˜η : Z[Z] → H 0(Za ⋊α Zb; Z) is the Z[Z]-homomorphism deﬁned by
˜η(1) = [η], then [˜η] generates H 1(Z; H 0(Za ⋊α Zb; Z)) and [η] is the identity in
H ∗(Za ⋊α Zb; Z).

For n ≥ 2, we need representatives for the generating classes of the following

groups (where i > 0):

Cohomology of virtually cyclic groups

1. H 0(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z

2. H 0(Z; H 21i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) = H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))Z

3. H 1(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z

4. H 1(Z; H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) = H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))Z

We start with H 0(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z. We know
that Zb acts on H 2i(Za; Z) by multiplication by ri, so H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z ∼=
(Zδi )Z, where

Zδi = {x ∈ Za : rix ≡ x (mod a)}
= {x ∈ Za : x ≡ 0 (mod a/δi)}
= {x ∈ Za : x = (ka)/δi, k ∈ Z}.

Since Z acts on Zδi by multiplication by ci

a, we obtain

(Zδi )Z = {x ∈ Zδi

: (ci

a − 1)x ≡ 0 (mod a)},

and the fact that x = (ka)/δi yields the equation

which has the solution

(ci

a − 1)ka

δi

≡ 0 (mod a),

k ≡ 0(cid:18)mod gcd(cid:18)a,

a(ci

a − 1)
δi

(cid:19)(cid:19) ⇐⇒ k ≡ 0(cid:18)mod

a
δi

gcd(δi, ci

a − 1)(cid:19) .

Hence a representative for the generating class of

H 0(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) ∼= (Zδi )Z

is the map ui

a : Z[Za] → Z given by

ui
a(1) =

a

δi
gcd(δi, (ci

a − 1))

=

gcd(δi, ci

.

More precisely, if ϕi

a(1) = [ui

a] and if ˜ϕi
a(1) = [ϕi

a : Z[Zb] → H 2i(Za, Z) is the Z[Zb]-homomorphism given by
a : Z[Z] → H 0(Zb, H 2i(Za, Z)) is the Z[Z]-homomorphism

a], then [ ˜ϕi

a] is a generating class for

H 0(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z ∼= (Zδi )Z.

Similarly, one representative for the generating class of

H 0(Z; H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) = H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))Z ∼= (Zb)Z

is the map ui

b : Z[Za] → Z given by

and we deﬁne ϕi
way similar to ϕi

b : Z[Zb] → H 0(Za; Z) and ˜ϕi
a and ˜ϕi
a.

b : Z[Z] → H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z)) in a

The same reasoning applies to determine a representative for the generating

class of

H 1(Z; H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))) = H 0(Zb; H 2i(Za; Z))Z ∼= (Zδi )Z,

this representative being the map vi

a : Za → Z deﬁned by

vi
a(1) =

a
δi

.

Finally, a representative for the generating class of

H 1(Z; H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) = H 2i(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))Z = (Zb)Z

is the map vi

b : Z[Za] → Z given by

vi
b(1) = 1.

The maps ψi

b and ˜ψi

The last necessary ingredients we need to calculate the cup products in
H ∗(G, Z) are the diagonal approximations for the known free resolutions of Z
over Z[Z] and over Z[Zm] for m > 1.

For Z = hsi, a free resolution F of Z over ZG is given by

where F1 = F0 = Z[Z],and a direct veriﬁcation shows that ∆n : Fn → (F ⊗ F )n

is a diagonal approximation for the resolution F .

For the cyclic group Zm = ht | tm = 1i, a free resolution P of Z over Z[Zm]

4 The cohomology ring of [Za ⋊ (Zb × Q2i)] ⋊ Z

Let i ≥ 3 be an integer and Q2i = hx, y | x2i−2
= y2, xyx = yi. The group
G = [Za ⋊ (Zb × Q2i)] ⋊ Z for gcd(a, b) = gcd(ab, 2) = 1 can be obtained as
a sequence of extensions, and we will follow through this sequence in order to
calculate its integral cohomology ring.

First, we note that the integral cohomology ring of the groups Q2i (actually,

Q4n) has been determined in [29]:

Theorem 4.1 (Tomoda and Zvengrowski, [29]). The cohomology ring H ∗(Q2i ; Z)
has the following presentation for i ≥ 3:

Z[γ2, γ ′

2, δ4]

2 = 2iδ4 = 0

γ2
2 = 0, γ ′2

  2γ2 = 2γ ′
  2γ2 = 2γ ′

γ2
2 = γ ′2

2 = γ2γ ′
2, δ4]

Z[γ2, γ ′

2 = 2i−1δ4! ,
2 = 4δ4! ,

2 = 8δ4 = 0

2 = 0, γ2γ ′

if i > 3;

if i = 3;




H ∗(Q2i ; Z) =

where dim(γ2) = dim(γ ′

2) = 2, dim(δ4) = 4.

Let’s consider the extension

and the associated spectral sequence E with

Ep,q

2 = H p(Q2i ; H q(Zb; Z)) ⇒ H p+q(Zb × Q2i; Z).

The group Q2i acts trivially on Zb, hence Q2i also acts trivially on H ∗(Zb; Z).
It follows now from [5, section XII.7] and the fact that b is odd that

(mod 4) for p ≥ 4;

∞ = Ep,q

Therefore Ep,q

2 , we have no extension problems to consider since b is
odd, and the induced product on E2 gives us the cohomology ring of Zb × Q2i:
writing H ∗(Zb; Z) =

with dim(β2) = 2, we have β2γ2 = β2γ ′

Z[β2]

2 =

(bβ2 = 0)

β2δ4 = 0 in H ∗(Zb × Q2i; Z), plus the relations among γ2, γ ′
already hold in H ∗(Q2i ; Z). Thus we have proved the following:

tation for i ≥ 3:

The next step is to consider the extension

where β : Zb × Q2i → Aut(Za) is given by

β(1b)(1a) = r · 1a,
β(1b)(x) = rx · 1a,
β(1b)(y) = ry · 1a,

with r, rx and ry satisfying rb ≡ r2
Serre sequence associated to the above extension is such that

Ep,q

2 = H p(Zb × Q2i; H q(Za; Z)) ⇒ H p+q(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i); Z).

Cohomology of virtually cyclic groups

Since the ring H ∗(Za; Z) is generated by an element of dimension 2, we have

H p(Zb × Q2i; Z),
H p(Zb × Q2i; ˜Za),
0,

if q = 0;
if q ≥ 2 is even;
if q is odd;

where ˜Za = H q(Za; Z) represents the (Zb ×Q2i)-module Za with the appropriate

of 1b ∈ Zb on H 2j(Za; Z) = ˜Za is the multiplication by rj , the action of x ∈ Q2i
is the multiplication by rj
x and the action of y ∈ Q2i is the multiplication by rj
y.
If we now consider the spectral sequence ˜E associated to the extension

with coeﬃcients in ˜Za, we have

˜Ep,q

2 = H p(Q2i ; H q(Zb; ˜Za)) ⇒ H p+q(Zb × Q2i; ˜Za),

and from this we actually get

˜Ep,q

2 =(H p(Q2i; Zδj ),

0,

if q = 0;
if q > 0;

with δj = gcd(a, rj − 1). The spectral sequence therefore collapses on ˜E2 and,
since gcd(δj, 2i) = 1, we have

H p(Zb × Q2i; ˜Za) = H p(Q2i; Zδj ) =(Zεj ,

if p > 0;

β(1b)(y) = ry · 1a,

Our work above actually allows us to determine the integral cohomology ring

of Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i), and not just its cohomology groups.

the elements

2 = Ep,q

Proof. We have just shown that the spectral sequence with E2 page given by (6)
is such that Ep,q
2 = 0 if p and q are both positive and also
if one of p or q is odd. Hence the product on E2 induces the cup product
on H ∗(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i); Z). The derivation of equation (7) shows that one

Finally, let G = [Za ⋊β (Zb×Q2i)]⋊θ Z for some θ : Z → Aut(Za ⋊β (Zb×Q2i))

and let’s consider the extension

Corollary 2.2 says that

H n(cid:0)[Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i)] ⋊θ Z; Z(cid:1) =(H n(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i ); Z)Z,

H n−1(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i ); Z)Z,

if n is even;
if n is odd;

so we will study now the action of Z on H ∗(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i ); Z). The action
on H 0(Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i); Z) is trivial, hence H n([Za ⋊β (Zb × Q2i)] ⋊θ Z; Z) = Z
for n = 0 and n = 1. For j > 0, we have

since εj, b and 2 are pairwise coprime. Therefore, if j > 0, in order to study the
action of Z on

where c, ca, cb, cx and cy are chosen according to [11]. Let’s denote by θa the
map θ(1)|Za : Za → Za, by θb the map θ(1)|Zb : Zb → Zb, where θ(1) : Zb ×Q2i →
Zb × Q2i is the induced map on the quotient, and by θQ the map θ(1) : Q2i →
Q2i. With this notation, we have

θa(1a) = ca · 1a,

θb(1b) = cb · 1b,

θQ(x) = xk,

θQ(y) = xℓy.

Now the map H ∗(θQ; H ∗(θb; H ∗(θa; Z))) can be used to calculate the Z-action
on each of the summands described in Equation (8). We get that the Z-action
on H 0(Q2i ; H 0(Zb; H 2j(Za; Z))) is the multiplication by cj
a on Zεj and the Z-
action on H 0(Q2i ; H 2j(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) is the multiplication by cj
b on Zb. As
Aut(Q8) doesn’t follow the pattern of Aut(Q2i) for i > 3, the analysis of the
Z-action on H 0(Q2i ; H 2j(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) will be broken in the cases i = 3 and
i > 3.

Lemma 4.5. Let i > 3 and let θ be the Z-action on Q2i given by θ(1)(x) = xk,
with k odd, and θ(1)(y) = xℓy, with ℓ ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 2i−1 − 1}. The induced Z-
action θ(2) on H 2(Q2i; Z) is the trivial action if ℓ is even. If ℓ is odd, θ(2) is
determined by the automorphism θ(2)(1) given by θ(2)(1)(γ2) = γ2, θ(2)(1)(γ ′
2) =
γ2 + γ ′
2 are the generators of H ∗(Q2i ; Z) given by Theorem 4.1.
Proof. We have H 2(Q2i; Z) ∼= H1(Q2i; Z) ∼= (Q2i )ab ∼= Z2 ⊕ Z2, with generators
2 = y. Since θ(1)(x) = xk and k is odd, θ(2)(1)(α2) = α2, and
γ2 = x e γ ′
θ(1)(y) = xℓy implies θ(2)(1)(γ ′
2 if ℓ is
even.

2, if ℓ is odd and θ2(1)(γ ′

2, where γ2 and γ ′

2) = γ2 + γ ′

2) = γ ′

By [11] and [25], the induced Z-action on H 2j(Q2i ; H 0(Zb; H 0(Za; Z))) for
j > 0 even is the multiplication by kj. From that, the following result is
obtained:

Proposition 4.6. Let θ be the Z-action on Q2i of the previous Lemma. The
Z-action θ(4m+2) induced by θ on H 4m+2(Q2i; Z) coincides with θ(2) induced on
H 2(Q2i; Z).

Proof. By Theorem 4.1, the ring H ∗(Q2i; Z) is given by

(2γ2 = 2γ ′

2 = 2iδ4 = 0, γ2

Z[γ2, γ ′

2, δ4]
2 = 0, γ ′
2

2 = γ2γ ′

2 = 2i−1δ4)

.

The generators of H 4m+2(Q2i ; Z) are δm
2. If the induced Z-action on
H 2(Q2i; Z) is the trivial one, it is clear that the induced action on H 4m+2(Q2i; Z)
is also trivial. If the action on H 2(Q2i ; Z) is not trivial, then

since k2m is odd, and the result follows.

Lemma 4.7. For Q8 = hx, y | x2 = y2, xyx = yi any action of Z on
H 2(Q8; Z) = Z2 ⊕ Z2 can be realized as an induced action of Z on Q8.

Proof. As in Lemma 4.5, the generators of H 2(Q8) = Z2 ⊕ Z2 are γ2 = x and

2 = y. Let (cid:20)a b

d(cid:21) ∈ M2(Z2) be the matrix that represents some Z-action on

H 2(Q8; Z) = Z2 ⊕ Z2, where a, b, c, d are integers and a, b, c, d represent classes
modulo 2. One action of Z on Q8 that induces the desired action on H 2(Q8; Z)
is θ(1)(x) = xayc and θ(1)(y) = xbyd.

Since any action of Z on Q8 induces the trivial action on H 4(Q8; Z), a result

analogue to Proposition 4.6 holds:

Proposition 4.8. Let θ be a Z-action on Q8. The induced Z-action θ(4m+2)
on H 4m+2(Q8; Z) coincides with the induced action θ(2) on H 2(Q8; Z).

Let Aj = gcd(cj

b − 1, b) e Cj = gcd(kj − 1, 2i), and
recall that θQ(x) = xk and θQ(y) = xℓy. From our work so far in this section

n = 4j + 1 (when j > 0) and n = 4j + 3, the generators of H n(G; Z) are
just the classes of the elements that generate the respective cohomology groups
H ∗(Za ⋊β (Zb × ZQ2i ); Z) that are given by Theorem 4.4. We can apply a similar
reasoning to the one used to prove Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 4.4 and write down
all the cup products in H ∗(G; Z) if we so desire, and we can also compute the
period in H ∗(G; Z): if p = lcm(d, dca , dcb, dk), then we have A2j = a, B2j = b
and C2j = 2i if, and only if, p | 2j.
It now follows from equation (3) and
Theorem 4.4 that, if p is even,

U(Z
be the order of r in U(Za). Finally, let p = lcm(d, dca , dcb, dk). If p is even,
