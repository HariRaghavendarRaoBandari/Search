ABSTRACT

× 1.2′′ and 25′′

Sgr B2 is a well-known star forming molecular cloud complex in the Galac-
tic center region showing evidence of high energy activity as traced by the
Kα neutral FeI line at 6.4 keV, as well as GeV and TeV γ-ray emission.
Here we present VLA and GMRT observations with respective resolutions of
≈ 3.5′′
× 25′′ and report the detection of an OH(1720 MHz)
maser, with no accompanying OH 1665, 1667 and 1612 MHz maser emission.
The maser coincides with a 150 MHz nonthermal radio source in Sgr B2(M).
This rare class of OH(1720 MHz) masers or the so-called supernova remnant
(SNR) masers, with no main line transitions, trace shocked gas and signal the
interaction of an expanding SNR with a molecular cloud. We interpret the 150
MHz radio source as either the site of a SNR – molecular gas interaction or a
wind-wind collision in a massive binary system. The interaction of the molec-
ular cloud and the nonthermal source enhances the cosmic-ray ionization rate,
allows the diﬀusion of cosmic rays into the cloud and produces the variable
6.4 keV line, GeV and TeV γ-ray emission from Sgr B2(M). The cosmic ray
electron interaction with the gas in the Galactic center can not only explain
the measured high values of cosmic ray ionization and heating rates but also
contribute to nonthermal bremsstrahlung continuum emission, all of which are
consistent with observations.

Introduction

Interaction between a supernova remnant and a molecular cloud is traced by bright spots
of 1720 MHz OH maser emission (Frail, Goss & Slysh 1994; Wardle & Yusef-Zadeh 2002).
About 24 known supernova remnants are associated with this rare class of masers (Frail et
al. 1996; Green et al. 1997; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1996, 2003a,b; Green et al. 1997; Koralesky
et al. 1998; Hewitt & Yusef-Zadeh 2009; Brogan et al. 2013). These OH(1720 MHz) masers
are collisionally pumped in molecular gas at temperatures and density range 50-200 K and
∼ 104−6 cm−3, respectively (Lockett, Gauthier & Elitzur 1999). The enhanced column of
OH at the interaction site requires X-rays or cosmic rays from the SNR to irradiate the
water-rich gas behind a C-type shock wave (Wardle, Yusef-Zadeh & Geballe 1999; Wardle
1999). SNRs interacting with molecular clouds have also shown a correlation between γ-ray
and X-ray emission as well as SNR masers (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2003a; Hewitt, Yusef-Zadeh
and Wardle 2009), thus consistent with an enhanced cosmic ray ﬂux or X-rays.

One site that might be suitable to study molecular shocks and high energy emission in
the Galaxy is Sgr B2, a spectacular star forming region in the Galactic center. Sgr B2
is associated with a massive molecular cloud and contains 41 UC HII regions; (e.g., Lis
& Goldsmith 1989; De Pree et al. 2014). Recent monitoring of UC HII regions indicate
signiﬁcant radio continuum ﬂux variation over the last 20 years (De Pree et al. 2014). Sgr
B2 is also a prominent site of high energy activity, being a a source of hard X-rays, GeV
and TeV γ-rays. It also displays variable ﬂuorescent emission in the neutral iron Kα line at
6.4 keV (Revnivtstev et al. 2004; Terrier et al. 2010) either due to irradiation by a burst
of X-rays from Sgr A* (e.g., Zhang et al. 2015) or a variable low energy cosmic-ray electron
ﬂux (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007a). In fact, a radio source was identiﬁed toward Sgr B2 at 255
and 327 MHz, suggesting that it is a nonthermal source embedded in the cloud and that the
origin of the FeI Kα line emission is tied to a high cosmic ray ionization rate in the cloud
(Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007b).

To search for sites of interaction between SNRs and molecular gas, we carried out a sensitivity–
limited OH survey of the region between Sgr C (G0.5-0.0) and Sgr B2 (G0.67–0.05) of the
Galactic center. We ﬁnd only two clouds from which OH(1720 MHz) masers are detected.
One is associated with the Sgr A East SNR (G0.0+0.0) interacting with the 50 km s−1 molec-
ular cloud (e.g., Wardle, Yusef-Zadeh & Geballe 1999; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1996; Sjouwerman
& Philstr¨om 2008). The other is the detection of an OH(1720 MHz) maser coincident with
Sgr B2(M) with no accompanying 1665/67 MHz emission. Here we focus on the relationship
between the OH(1720 MHz) maser and a 150 MHz nonthermal source found in Sgr B2(M).

2. Observation and Data Reduction: VLA & GMRT

A survey of the Galactic center was carried out with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
searching for all four ground state transitions of OH (1612, 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz).
Details of these observations, which covered the inner 96′
× 43′ (l × b) using 11 pointings
along the inner Galactic plane, will be given elsewhere (Cotton & Yusef-Zadeh 2016, in

– 3 –

preparation). Brieﬂy, the L-band observations were centered on the rest frequency of the
OH satellite (1.612231, 1.72053 GHz) and main (1.66540184, 1.667359 GHz) lines and were
made on May 31, 2014 using the VLA in “A” conﬁguration. The velocity range covered
was ≈ −420 to +235 km s−1 with a spectral and spatial resolution of ≈ 0.73 km s−1 and
≈ 3.5′′
×1.2”, respectively. Each pointing was observed for 2 minutes in three scans separated
by about 45 minutes. Calibration followed the procedure given in Cotton & Yusef-Zadeh
(2016).

The 1.7 GHz data were imaged using faceting to cover the primary beam. Continuum
imaging was done after phase self-calibration on each pointing using all four subbands out
to a radius of 30′ and was CLEANed.
In the quieter ﬁelds, the oﬀ source RMS in the
continuum images was ≈1 mJy beam−1 although with much variation and many artifacts
from the strong, almost completely resolved emission. Spectral line channels were imaged to
a radius of 13.6′. Typical RMSes in line free channels are ≈50 mJy beam−1.

Archival data from a 150 MHz GMRT sky survey (TGSS) were obtained from the GMRT
archive, and processed with a fully automated pipeline (Intema et al. 2009, 2014), which
includes direction-dependent calibration, modeling and imaging of ionospheric phase delay.
A full survey of the radio sky at 150 MHz as visible from the GMRT (Swarup et al. 1991)
was performed between 2010 and early 2012, covering the full declination range of −55 to
+90 degrees. The survey consists of more than 5000 pointings on an approximate hexagonal
grid. Data were recorded in half polarization (RR,LL) every 2 seconds, in 256 frequency
channels across 16 MHz of bandwidth (140–156 MHz). Each pointing was observed for
about 15 minutes, split over 3 or more scans spaced out in time to improve UV-coverage.

3. Results

Apart from the known OH(1720 MHz) masers associated with the Sgr A East SNR (Yusef-
Zadeh et al.
1996; Sjouwerman & Philstr¨om 2008), the surveyed region uncovers only
one additional OH(1720 MHz) source, G0.6647-0.0358, in Sgr B2(M). Figure 1 shows the
spectrum of OH(1720 MHz) emission toward this source in Sgr B2. A list of ﬁtted parameters
of OH(1720 MHz) emission is given in Table 1. Entries in columns 1 to 9 give the source
name, RA, Dec coordinates, Galactic l, b coordinates, peak ﬂux density, radial velocity, the
linewidth and the lower limit to the brightness temperature value, respectively. The velocity
of the OH(1720 MHz) maser is ∼ 62 km s−1 corresponding to the systematic velocity of the
cloud. G0.6647-0.0358 is a maser because of its narrow linewidths ∼ 0.7 km s−1 and a lower
limit to the brightness temperature Tb ∼ 4.8 × 104 K assuming a source size of 3.5′′
× 1.2′′.
We also searched for OH emission at 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz from the position of G0.6647-
0.0358 and found a 1σ RMS noise of ∼ 200, 100 and 35 mJy beam−1 at 1665, 1667 and 1612
MHz, respectively (Cotton and Yusef-Zadeh 2016).

A number of past studies have detected strong OH maser emission from G0.6647-0.0358 in
Sgr B2(M) (e.g., Caswell & Haynes 1983; Gaume & Mutel 1987; Argon, Reid & Menten
2000 (ARM)). A sensitive OH survey of the sky with the VLA with a spectral resolution
× 1.5′′ and RMS sensitivity of 90 mJy channel−1
of 0.14 km s−1, spatial resolution of 2.6′′

– 4 –

detected two OH (1720 MHz) masers within 1σ positional error of G0.6647-0.0358 (ARM).
Both masers, which are detected in two studies, are highly polarized and have ﬂux densities
ranging between 1.6 and 14 Jy with linewidths between 0.38 and 0.46 km s−1 (ARM; Gaume
& Mutel 1987) Given our poorer sensitivity and spectral resolution, it is most likely that the
two masers are spectrally not resolved in our low-resolution data and/or are variable. ARM
found no 1612/1665/1667 MHz counterparts to the OH(1720 MHz) masers in Sgr B2(M)
whereas Gaume & Mutel (1987) ﬁnd a OH(1665 MHz) LCP counterpart with a ﬂux density
of 0.4 Jy. The OH(1720 MHz) maser G0.6647-0.0358 is displaced from star forming OH
masers in Sgr B2(M) by about 3′′ and is likely to be a member of a rare class of OH masers
related to SNR masers. However, there is a compact HII region Sgr B2 D that is identiﬁed
at 1.3cm within 0.5′′ of the OH(1720 MHz) maser (De Pree et al. 1996), thus we can not
rule out the possibility that the OH(1720 MHz) masers are associated with Sgr B2 D.

× 16.8′′ and 12.6′′

Figure 2a shows contours of 150 MHz emission with a resolution of 25′′
× 25′′ superimposed
on a grayscale image at 23 GHz with a resolution of ∼ 0.3′′
× 0.2′′ (PA∼ 68◦) (De Pree
et al. 2005). The 150 MHz source also coincides with a 255 and 327 MHz source within
resolutions of 22.5′′
× 6.8′′, respectively (Yusef-Zadeh, Wardle & Roy 2007).
Figure 2b shows contours of 327 MHz from Sgr B2(M) based on VLA observations (Nord
et al. 2004). The cross drawn on these ﬁgures coincides with the position of the OH(1720
MHz) maser G0.6647-0.0358 at the velocity of ∼ 62 km s−1. The concentration of compact
and UC HII regions traced at 23 GHz lie to the NE of the 327 and 150 MHz peak emission.
This is because the emission from these HII regions become opaque at low frequencies. The
oﬀset between 327 and 150 MHz peak emission, noted by comparing contours of emission in
Figure 2a and 2b, is explained by the contribution of thermal emission to the nonthermal
source at 327 MHz. The color image in Figure 3a shows the composite image at 150 MHz,
327 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The extended feature (blue) traces the emission from HII regions at
high frequency. A close-up of the region where low frequency emission dominates, is shown
in Figure 3b. The emission at 255 and 327 MHz shows weak extended emission from thermal
HII regions whereas there is no evidence of weak HII emission at 150 MHz.

We estimate the contribution of HII regions to the ﬂux density at six diﬀerent frequencies
within a 25′′ beam at the position of the remnant, Sν = (SSNR + S(1)
hii) exp(−τs) with
emitted ﬂux densities SSNR from the remnant, and S(1)
h ii from compact and UC HII
regions within the beam, respectively. Here τs = τ150 (ν/150 MHz)−2.1 is the optical depth
of the extended ionized screen lying in front of the Galactic center, which has τ150 ∼ 1 (Roy
2013). The remnant is assumed to have a non-thermal spectrum SSNR = S150(ν/150 MHZ)−α.

Additional support for nonthermal emission from Sgr B2 comes from GBT observations
(Hollis et al. 2007; Crocker et al. 2007 but see Lang, Palmer & Goss 2008). The ﬂux
densities from the HII regions are written S(i)

is the beam ﬁlling factor, ΩB is the beam solid angle, Bν(T ) is the Planck function, and
τ (i)
ν = (ν/ν(i)

t )−2.1 is the optical depth and νt is the turnover frequency.

h ii = f (i) ΩB Bν(T ) (1 − exp(−τ (i)

A formal ﬁtting of this model to the data has not been made because there is correlation
amongst the parameters.
Instead, we show an example in Figure 4, obtained by setting
τ150 = 1, α = 0.5, T = 8500 K and adjusting the remaining parameters to obtain a reasonable
match to the observed spectrum, ﬁnding S150 = 0.30 Jy, f (1) = 0.22, ν(1)
t = 2.3 GHz, f (2) =
2.2 ×10−3, and ν(2)
t = 50 GHz. Note that the 1.4 and 4.8 GHz ﬂux densities constrain the ﬂux
density and turnover frequency of the compact HII region component but the parameters for
the UC HII region component are less constrained, as the beam ﬁlling factor and turnover
frequency can be traded oﬀ to yield the observed 23 GHz ﬂux density.

The spectral index of the SNR is poorly constrained because of the uncertain magnitude of
the absorption by the foreground screen. For example, a similar ﬁt to the low-frequency data
can be obtained adopting a ﬂat SNR spectrum (α = 0) and setting τ150 ≈ 0.5. Nevertheless,
in this case S150 ≈ 0.18 Jy and we conclude that the remnant’s intrinsic ﬂux density is
∼ 0.25 Jy at 150 MHz even though its spectral index is poorly constrained.

4. Discussion

The most interesting result of our observations is the evidence for OH(1720 MHz) masers
coincident with a low frequency nonthermal radio source in Sgr B2(M). The detection of
a 150 MHz source and an OH(1720 MHz) maser at the radial velocity of Sgr B2 provide
compelling evidence for shocked molecular gas resulting from the interaction of a nonthermal
radio source and the Sgr B2(M) molecular cloud. This rare class of OH masers is diﬀerent
than star forming OH masers where all four transitions of OH are observed as masers and
the 1665/67 OH masers are strongest. A number of star formation OH masers are detected
in the Sgr B2(M) but there is no OH(1720 MHz) detected within 3′′ of G0.6647-0.0358 (see
Fig. 4 of ARM). The characteristics of the OH(1720 MHz) maser in Sgr B2 are similar to
those observed in the Galaxy where SNRs expand into a molecular cloud, interact with the
gas, increase the cosmic ray ionization rate at the site of the interaction. The nonthermal
source with an OH(1702 MHz) counterpart is likely to be the site of an interaction of an
expanding remnant with the Sgr B2 cloud. It is possible that remnant is extended beyond
G0.6647-0.0358 with low surface brightness, thus is not detectable with present 150 MHz
sensitivity.

Given the large number of UC HII region excited by young O stars in Sgr B2, the progenitor
to the nonthermal source is likely to be an O star that exploded as a supernova, and we
are witnessing a shock from an expanding SNR driving into the parent molecular cloud.
Another possibility is that the nonthermal emission is produced in a massive binary system
(e.g. Chapman et al. 1999; Eichler & Usov 1993), though to date all the known OH(1720
MHz) masers are found in interacting SNRs.

4.1. High Energy Emission from Sgr B2(M)

The evidence for a compact SNR interacting with the molecular gas has a number of im-
portant implications. First, population inversion and signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation in the 1720
MHz line requires densities ∼ 105 cm−3, temperatures in the range 30–125 K, an OH col-
umn density in the range 1016–1017 cm−2 and an absence of a strong FIR continuum (Lockett,
Gauthier & Elitzur 1999). In this picture, the interacting region must be self-shielded against
FIR radiation; the UV radiation from young massive stars is absorbed by dust grains and
reradiated in the FIR. Second, the synchrotron source injects relativistic particles into the
molecular cloud at the interaction site. In particular, low energy cosmic rays must contribute
to the ionization and heating of molecular gas potentially producing the FeI 6.4 keV line and
hard X-ray emission, whereas high energy cosmic ray particles interact with the dense gas,
yielding γ-ray emission.

We use the observed 150 MHz ﬂux density to estimate the likely magnitude of these eﬀects.
Unfortunately the spectral index is poorly determined, so we consider E−2 or E−3 relativistic
electron spectra, which would yield ν −0.5 or ν −1 synchrotron spectra, respectively. We assume
that the electron spectrum extends between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, that the proton to electron
ratio is 100 and adopt a spherical source with radius 1 pc. Then we ﬁnd an equipartition
magnetic ﬁeld of 0.26 or 0.6 mG for E−2 or E−3, respectively. This implies an energy density
of relativistic electrons ∼ 17 or 88 eV cm−3. The total energy in relativistic electrons is
∼ 4.2 × 1044 or ∼ 2.2 × 1045 erg. This implies that cosmic ray electrons ionization rate is
ζ ∼ 1.1 × 10−14 or ζ ∼ 2.5 × 10−13 s−1 (see equation 3 of Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2013). This
estimate is consistent with a number of recent measurements indicating a vast amount of
diﬀuse H+
3 , OH+, H2O+ and H3O+ distributed in Sgr B2 and the Galactic center, implying
a cosmic ray ionization rate ζ ∼ 10−15 − 10−14 s−1 H−1 in the Galactic center region is one to
two orders of magnitude higher than in the Galactic disk (Oka et al. 2005; Geballe & Oka
2010; van der Tak et al. 2006; Indriolo et al. 2015; Le Petit et al. 2016).

The Sgr B2 cloud is the most massive cloud of the Galactic center region with hydrogen
column density NH ∼ 9.8 × 1024 cm−2 toward Sgr B2(M) (Lis & Goldsmith 1989; Etxaluze et
al. 2013). The interaction of relativistic electrons and their secondaries with the molecular
gas also produces Fe Kα line emission and a nonthermal bremsstrahlung continuum extending
from X-rays to γ-rays. To estimate the Kα line emission, we note that each ionization is
associated with the loss of 40eV of energy by relativistic electrons and that the eﬃciency of
Kα photon production is ∼200 photons for each erg of energy lost (Yusef-Zadeh et al 2013).
Using the values of the cosmic ray ionization rate and the column density, the intensity of
Kα line emission at 6.4 keV is estimated IKα ∼ 1.3 × 10−6 or ∼ 2.9 × 10−5 photons s−1
cm−2 arcmin−2, assuming a metalicity of 3 (see equation 6 of Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2013).

The interaction of cosmic ray electrons with the gas in the Galactic center can not only ex-
plain the measured high values of cosmic ray ionization and heating rates but also contribute
to nonthermal bremsstrahlung continuum emission. Assuming the number density of hydro-
gen nuclei in atomic or molecular form, nH = n(HI) + 2n(H2) ∼ 3 × 106 cm−3, the expected
γ-ray ﬂux at 1 GeV and 1 TeV are Fγ ≈ 3 × 10−10 and 3 × 10−19 ph cm−2 s−1 GeV−1,
respectively, for α = 1 or ≈ 1 × 10−8 and 1 × 10−14 ph cm−2 s−1 GeV−1, for α = 0.5,

– 7 –

respectively.

Sgr B2(M) is representative of a population of molecular clouds in the Galactic center that
display steady and variable components of Kα line emission as well as GeV and TeV γ-
rays. Sunyaev et al.
(1993) suggested that the Kα and nonthermal continuum emission
from Galactic center molecular clouds is a result of an echo from an X-ray ﬂare from Sgr
A*. The variability analysis of some clouds showed superluminal motion and supported the
photo-ionization model of Kα emission (Koyama et al. 1996; Terrier et al. 2010). The high
column density of 1025 cm−2 in Sgr B2(M) requires a special geometry in order to explain
the X-ray echo model in Sgr B2(M). The presence of a nonthermal radio source interacting
with dense molecular gas in Sgr B2(M), suggests that a nonthermal radio source interacting
with molecular gas can also produce the 6.4 keV line emission with the assumption that the
metalicity in Sgr B2(M) is three times higher than the solar value. Thus, it is not clear
which mechanism dominates the Kα line emission from Galactic center clouds. There are,
however, independent measurements favoring the cosmic ray picture, as described below.

One is the critical role that low energy cosmic ray electrons play in explaining the enhanced
H+
3 absorption implying high cosmic ray ionization rate (Oka et al. 2005). Second, the high
energy γ-ray emission provides a strong constraint on the interaction of high energy cosmic
ray particles with Galactic center molecular clouds. The Galactic center is now recognized
to have excess γ-ray emission at energies between 20 MeV to TeV implying a high cosmic
ray density (Aharonian et al. 2006; Abdo et al. 2009). Third, cosmic rays can naturally
heat the gas and explain the elevated gas temperature relative to the dust temperature in
Galactic center molecular clouds (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007). Fourth, there is strong diﬀuse
nonthermal radio emission from the Galactic center as well as a large number of magnetized
radio ﬁlaments (Nord et al. 2004; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007a). In particular, 74 MHz radio
emission shows a spatial correlation with Galactic center molecular clouds suggesting that
cosmic ray electrons are diﬀusing through the molecular gas (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2013). Fifth,
the enhanced abundance of SiO and methanol as well as the unusual abundance ratios found
throughout Galactic center molecular clouds suggests that cosmic rays drive the chemistry
of the gas (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2013). Lastly, the variable radio emission observed on a ∼20-
year time scale in Sgr B2(M) (De Pree et al. 2014) may be due to the variable nonthermal
radio source which is embedded within Sgr B2(M). Future monitoring of low frequency radio
and high energy emission will determine the contribution of cosmic rays in explaining the
observed features in this complex region of the Galaxy.

In summary, the detection of OH(1720 MHz) maser emission adjacent to a nonthermal source
suggests that a source of particle acceleration, most likely a SNR is physically interacting
with the dense gas in Sgr B2(M). These measurements have important implications for the
nature of 6.4 keV and γ-ray emission in the Galactic center, supporting a scenario in which
cosmic rays are responsible for the production of high energy radiation in Sgr B2(M).

Fig. 4.— Observed (points) and modeled (solid curve) spectrum from Sgr B2. The observed
peak ﬂux density is estimated from background subtracted Gaussian ﬁt to multi-wavelength
images convolved to 25′′ resolution. Flux density errors for the three data points at interme-
diate frequencies are smaller than the point size and are suppressed. Dashed curves indicate
the inferred emission from the SNR (blue), from compact and UC HII regions within the
beam (red), and the sum of all three components (black). The solid curve is obtained from
the black dashed curve by correcting for absorption by a thermal foreground with τ = 1 at
150 MHz (see text).
