Abstract

We introduce and study a Serre functor in the category Pd of strict
polynomial functors over a ﬁeld of positive characteristic. By using
it we obtain the Poincar´e duality formula for Ext–groups from [C3]
in elementary way. We also show that the derived category of the
category of aﬃne strct polynomial functors in some cases carries the
structure of Calabi-Yau category.

Introduction

In the present article we study a Serre functor in the category Pd of strict
polynomial functors of degree d over a ﬁeld of positive characteristic. Al-
though the existence of a Schur functor in our context follows from general
theory, its interplay with various structures living on Pd (Frobenius twist,
aﬃne subcategories, blocks) has some interesting consequences.

Our paper can be naturally divided into two parts: Section 2 and Sections
3–5.
The objective of the ﬁrst part is to give an elementary and self–contained
account of the Serre functor S in Pd and to quickly obtain with the aid of S
the Poincar´e duality formula from [C3]:

Corollary 2.4 Let λ be a Young diagram of weight d which is single in
its block (we call such a diagram and its block basic), let µ be any Young
diagram of weight pid. Let Fλ, Fµ be the corresponding simple objects. Then

d

We belive that the approach to the Poincar´e duality presented here is more
intuitive than that taken in [C3] and that it is also better adapted for possi-
ble generalizations.
Then in Sections 3–5 we turn attention to the category P afi
of i–aﬃne strict
polynomial functors of degree d and we introduce a (somewhat weaker version
of) Serre functor on its derived category DP afi
d . The main goal of this part
of the paper is to put the formula from Corollary 2.4 into a wider categorical
context. In general, a Serre functor produces Poincar´e duality in Ext–groups
when it acts on some object as the shift functor.
Indeed, we see in our
Proposition 2.3 that this exactly happens for some Frobenius twisted strict
polynomial functors (in fact, Corollary 2.4 is a formal conequence of Proo-
sition 2.3). We provide a categorical interpretation of this phenomenon by
ﬁnding certain subcategories of DP dpi on which the Serre functor is isomor-
phic to the shift functor (such categories are called Calabi–Yau). In fact, we
deﬁne these Calabi–Yau categories as the images of the basic blocks from Pd
in DP afi
(we call these subcategories “basic (aﬃne) semiblocks”). Appearing
d
of DP afi
d here is quite natural, since it is a full triangulated subcategory of
DP dpi generated by the Frobenius twisted objects [C4, Theorem 5.1]. Thus
we have succeeded in providing a categorical interpretation of the both as-
sumptions in Corollary 2.4: we specialize to DP afi
is twisted
and we restrict to the image of the block containing Fλ to take advantage of
the fact that λ is basic.
Below we describe the contents of Sections 3–5 in some detail since the con-
siderations there are much more involved than those in Section 2.
In Section 3 we study a Serre functor in DP afi
properties of the categories P afi

d . We start with reviewing basic
d . This is mainly recollecting some

facts from [C4] where these concepts were introduced and adapting them to
a slightly more general setting of “multiple twists” in which we work in the
present article. Then we proceed to deﬁne the Serre functor Safi in DP afi
d .
However, we need to adapt this notion to the fact that DP afi
d has inﬁnite di-
mensional Hom–spaces. Hence, technically, we deﬁne “a weak Serre functor
” (Deﬁnition 3.3) on DP afi
d .
In Section 4 we introduce “the semiblock decomposition” of DP afi
d . This is
a collection of reﬂective subcategories of DP afi
indexed by the set of blocks
d
in Pd. They generate DP afi
d but in contrast to genuine blocks they are not
orthogonal. We believe that this structure deserves further investigation, in
particular we conjecture that the semiblocks form a set of strata of certain
stratiﬁcation of DP afi
d . In the present article we restrict ourself to introduc-
ing the aﬃne derived Kan extension and Serre functor on the semiblocks.
This is a non–trivial task due to the non–orthogonality of semiblocks.
the subcategories of
In Section 5 we focus on the basic semiblocks,
DP afi
d which correspond to the blocks containing a single simple object.
We show (Theorem 5.1) that they are Calabi–Yau categories thus provid-
ing the promised categorical interpretation of our Poincar´e duality formula.
We ﬁnish our paper by giving various explicit descriptions of basic semiblocks
as categories of DG–modules over certain graded algebras (Proposition 5.5,
Corollary 5.6) which should make them easier to handle.
Hence the main result of this part of the paper is Theorem 5.1 which shows
that the basic semiblocks are Calabi–Yau categories. This is also important
from a more general point of view. Namely, it seems that the basic semi-
blocks constitute sort of building blocks for DP dpi, since many homological
problems concerning strict polynomial functors can be reduced to statements
about basic semiblocks. For example, the classical line of research started
in [FS] and [FFSS] may be thought of as expanding of our understanding
of the basic semiblock DP afi
onto the whole DP pi. To be more speciﬁc, let
1
us consider the fundamental problem of computing the Ext–groups between
simple objects in Pdpi. Then one can hope that by using tools like the the
(Schur)–de Rham complex this problem can be reduced to that of computing

i.e.

Ext∗

P

dpi (F (i)

λ , Fµ)

where λ is a basic Young diagram. This computation can be transferred by
the aﬃne derived Kan extension to the basic semiblock containing λ. There-
fore a better understanding of the internal structure of the basic semiblocks
seems to be an important step towards understanding DP dpi in general.

2 Serre functor in DP d

Let Pd be the category of strict polynomial functors of degree d over a ﬁxed
ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0 as deﬁned in [FS]. For a ﬁnite dimensional
k–vector space U we deﬁne the strict polynomial functor Sd
U ∗ ∈ Pd by the
formula

V 7→ Sd(Hom(U, V )).

We recall from [FS, Th. 2.10] the natural in U isomorphism

HomPd(F, Sd

U ∗) ≃ F (U)∗

for any F ∈ Pd. In fact, when we interpret Pd as a functor category as is done
e.g. in [FP, Sect. 3], this formula is just the Yoneda lemma. Hence later on
we will refer to this formula as to the Yoneda lemma. It immediately follows
from this formula that Sd
U ∗ is injective and it was shown in [FS, Th. 2.10]
that if dim(U) ≥ d then Sd
U ∗ is a cogenerator of Pd. Dually, we have a family
of projective objects Γd
U ∗ for which the Yoneda lemma gives the isomorphism

HomPd(Γd

U ∗, F ) ≃ F (U)

for any F ∈ Pd.
Let DP d denote the bounded derived category of Pd. We would like to deﬁne
a Serre functor in the sense of [BK] on DP d. The problem of existence of
Serre functor on a triangulated category is well understood [BV, RV]. The
existence of Serre functor on DP d follows from the fact that it is equivalent
to the bounded derived category of category of ﬁnitely generated modules
over a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of ﬁnite homological dimension. When we
translate the construction from [BV] into the context of functor categories
we get

Deﬁnition 2.1 We deﬁne a functor S : DP d −→ DP d by the formula

S(F )(V ) := HomDP d(Sd

V ∗, F ).

This functor was also mentioned in [Kr]. In our article we start a systematic
study of its properties. Our exposition is quite elementary, independent of
generalities of [BV] and self–contained (with exception of a few places where
we refer to [C1] to avoid repeting the same arguments). We start by warning
the reader that we chose to work with less common left Serre functors which

4

are easier to describe in the framework of functor categories (although also
the right Serre functor can be explicitly deﬁned by using either the Kuhn
duals, as we do in the proof of Theorem 2.2.4, or the monoidal structure on
Pd introduced in [Kr]). We gather below basic properties of S. Parts 1, 4, 5
essentially follow from generalities, parts 2 and 3 are more speciﬁc to Pd.

Theorem 2.2 The functor S satisﬁes the following properties

1. There is a natural in U isomorphism in Pd

S(Sd

U ∗) ≃ Γd

U ∗.

2. There is an isomorphism of functors

S ≃ Θ ◦ Θ

where Θ is the “Koszul duality” functor from [C1].

3. For any F ∈ DP d, G ∈ DP d′ there are isomorphisms in respectively

DP dpi, DP d+d′

• S(F (i)) ≃ S(F )(i)[−2d(pi − 1)]

• S(F ⊗ G) ≃ S(F ) ⊗ S(G).

4. S is a self-equivalence of DP d.

5. There is a natural in F, G ∈ DP d isomorphism

HomDP d(F, G) ≃ HomDP d(S(G), F )∗,

that is, S is a left Serre functor in the sense of [BK].

Proof: To see the ﬁrst part we recall that since Sd

U ∗ is injective, we have

S(Sd

U ∗(V )

U ∗)(V ) = HomDP d(Sd

V ∗, Sd

U ∗) ≃ HomPd(Sd

V ∗, Sd

U ∗) ≃ Sd

V ∗(U ∗)∗ ≃ Γd

by the Yoneda lemma.
In fact, [C1, Fact 2.2] can be easily extended to the “parameterized version”:

Θ((Sλ)U ∗) ≃ (Weλ)U ∗.

5

U ∗) ≃ Λd

U ∗) ≃ Γd
U ∗

U ∗ and Θ(Λd

From this we obtain the isomorphisms Θ(Sd
which give the second part.
The formulae from part 3 follow from the analogous facts holding for Θ [C1,
Fact 2.6].
It is immediate that the“right Serre functor” Sl := (−)# ◦ S ◦ (−)# where
(−)# is the Kuhn duality is the inverse of S (c.f.
[C1, Def. 2.3, Cor. 2.4]),
which gives the fourth part.
In order to obtain the last part, it suﬃces to establish a natural in U isomor-
phism

HomDP d(F, Sd

U ∗) ≃ HomDP d(S(Sd

U ∗), F )∗.

By the ﬁrst part and injectivity of Sd

U ∗ and projectivity of Γd

U ∗ it reduces to

HomPd(F, Sd

U ∗) ≃ HomPd(Γd

U ∗, F )∗,

which follows from the Yoneda lemma.

The fact that S is a Serre functor can be used to obtain the Poincar`e like
formulae for the Ext–groups, provided that we are able to compute S(F )
in some interesting cases. We shall ilustrate this idea by re–obtainng the
most important example of the Poincar`e duality formula for Ext–groups in
Pd established in [C3].
Let λ be the Young diagram of weight d which is a p–core. We recall that
the blocks in Pd are indexed by the p–core Young diagrams of weight d − jp
and that the block labeled by λ contains only one simple object Fλ. We call
such a Young diagram λ and the corresponding block basic.

Proposition 2.3 Let λ be a basic Young diagram. Then

S(F (i)

λ ) ≃ F (i)

λ [−2d(pi − 1)].

Proof: Since Fλ is single in its block, we have isomorphisms Fλ ≃ Sλ ≃ Wλ.
Therefore

Θ(Fλ) ≃ Θ(Sλ) = Weλ.
Now, since also Feλ is single in its block, we obtain
Θ(Weλ) ≃ Θ(Seλ) = Wλ ≃ Fλ.

Thus we see that S(Fλ) ≃ Fλ and our formula follows from Theorem 2.1.3.

The Poincar`e duality formula [C3, Example 3.3] is a formal consequence of
Proposition 2.3.

3 Serre functor for aﬃne functors

3.1 Review of i–aﬃne functors

d

The category of aﬃne strict polynomial functors P af
d was studied in [C4]. In
the present paper we introduce its slight generalization: the category of i–
aﬃne strict polynomial functors P afi
,hence we start with reviewing its basic
properties. Since all the proofs from [C4] still work in the present context,
the reader is referred for them to [C4]. The only exception where we provide
a full proof is Proposition 3.2 which was merely mentioned in [C4].
Let Ai := k[x1, x2, . . . , xi]/(xp
i ) for |xj| = 2pj and let ΓdVAi stands
for the following graded k–linear category. The objects of ΓdVAi are ﬁnite
dimensional vector spaces, though we follow the convention taken in [C4,
Section 2] and label them as V ⊗ Ai where V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space. The morphisms are given as

2, . . . xp

1, xp

HomΓdVAi

(V ⊗ Ai, W ⊗ Ai) := Γd(Hom(V, W ) ⊗ Ai).

An i–aﬃne strict polynomial functor of degree d is a graded functor from
ΓdVAi to the category of Z–graded bounded below ﬁnite dimensional in each

7

[C4, Section 2]). The i–aﬃne strict polynomial
degree vector spaces (c.f.
functors of degree d form the k–linear graded abelian category P afi
d with
morphisms being the natural transformations. For any ﬁnite dimensional
vector space U we have the representable i–aﬃne strict polynomial functors
of degree d hU ⊗Ai given by the formula

V ⊗ Ai 7→ HomΓdVAi

(V ⊗ Ai, W ⊗ Ai) = Γd(Hom(V, W ) ⊗ Ai),

and by the Yoneda lemma [C4, Prop. 2.2] we have

HomP af

d

(hU ⊗Ai, F ) ≃ F (U ⊗ Ai).

Similarly, we have the co–representable functor c∗

U ⊗Ai given by

V ⊗ A 7→ HomΓdVA(V ⊗ A, U ⊗ A)∗

where (−)∗ stands for the graded k–linear dual. This time the Yoneda lemma
gives

HomP af

d

(F, c∗

U ⊗A) ≃ F (U ⊗ A)∗.

Analogosly to the non–aﬃne case, P afi
gory. Namely, let as deﬁne the i–aﬃne Schur algebra Safi
Ai). Then F (kn ⊗ Ai) is naturally a graded Safi
Prop. 2.5]

is equivalent to some module cate-
d,n := Γd(End(kn)) ⊗
d,n–module and we have [C4,

d

Proposition 3.1 If n ≥ d then

evn : P afi

where Saf
degree graded Saf

d,n-modf + is the category of bounded below ﬁnite dimensional in each

d,n–modules, is an equivalence of graded abelian categories.

d which has right and left adjoints t∗, h∗ : P afi

The forgetful functor z : ΓdVAi −→ ΓdV induces an exact functor z∗ : Pd −→
P afi
d −→ Pd (consult [C4, Sect.
2] on grading issue).
Much deeper is relation between P afi
and Pdpi, since it only emerges at
the level of derived categories. In order to develop homological algebra in
P afi
d we regard it as a DG category (with the trivial diﬀerential) (see [K1],
[K2], [C4, Section 3]). Then we consider the category of complexes over
P afi
the category of graded functors from ΓdVAi to the category of

, i.e.

d

d

8

bounded below complexes of ﬁnite dimensional in each degree vector spaces.
The derived category DP afi
is obtained from the category of complexes by
d
inverting the class of quasiisomorphisms. This procedure can be conducted
within the formalism of Quillen model categories. Namely the category of
complexes over P afi
can be equipped with either of two model structures:
the projective one in which every object is ﬁbrant and hU ⊗Ai are coﬁbrant
and the injective one in which every object is coﬁbrant and c∗
U ⊗Ai are ﬁbrant.
In both cases the homotopy category is equivalent to DP afi
d .
The main result of [C4] is a construction of a full embedding

d

and its right adjoint

Cafi : P afi

d −→ Pdpi

Kafi : P afi

d −→ Pdpi

called the aﬃne derived Kan extension. This adjunction is compatible with
the adjunction {C, Kr} in the sense that we have isomorphisms of functors
[C4, Theorem 5.1]:

Kr ≃ t∗ ◦ Kaf , C ≃ Caf ◦ z∗.

We ﬁnish our review by discussing the compatibility of {Caf , Kaf } with the
Kuhn duality. This is a non–trivial problem, which was mentioned in [C4,
Sect. 6]. In particular we shall use in the proof the main result of [C3]. We
need it in the present article in order to connect the results of Sections 2 and
5.
We recall that DP d denotes the bounded derived category. We denote by
DP +
d the derived category coming from the bounded below complexes. Let
DP afi,b
containing
hU ⊗Ai and closed under taking direct factors. In other words: DP afi,b
is the
full subcategory of DP afi
d

be the smallest full triangulated subcategory of DP afi,

consisting of all compact objects.

Proposition 3.2 We have the following isomorphisms of functors:

as functors between DP +

dpi and DP af
d ,

2.

(−)# ◦ Caf ◦ (−)# ≃ Caf

as functors between DP afi,b

d

and DP dpi.

Proof: In fact the ﬁrst part can be deduced from the proof of [C3, Theo-
rem 2.1]. Let k : ΓdVAi −→ ΓdV be the functor induced by the projrction
Ai −→ k and let k∗ : DP d −→ DP afi,b
be the functor induced by the pre-
composition with k. Then

d

Kafi(Sdpi

U ∗ ) = k∗(Sd

U (i)∗)

and

k∗(Sd

U (i)∗) = k∗(Γd

U (i)∗)[−2d(pi − 1)]

c.f. [C4, Prop. 2.4.2]. Thus the isomorphism constructed in the proof of [C3,
Theorem 2.1] can be interpreted as

Kafi(F #) ≃ Kafi(F )#

for any F ∈ DP dpi. In order to extend this isomorphism to DP +
dpi we ob-
serve that, since Kafi commutes with inﬁnite direct colimits (because P • is a
compact object in DP +
dpi), both left and right hand sides take direct colimits
into codirect limits.
In order to obtain the second part we recall that

(hU ⊗Ai)# = c∗

U ∗⊗Ai[−2d(pi − 1)] = z∗(Sd

U ∗).

Hence

Cafi((hU ⊗Ai)#) = Cafi(z∗(Sd

U ∗) = Sd(i)

U ∗ =

U ∗)) = C(Sd
U ∗ )# = (Cafi(hU ⊗Ai))#,

(Γd(i)

which gives the required isomorphism for any F ∈ DP afi,b
. This time, since
Caf does not commute with inﬁnite codirect limits, the isomorphim cannot
be extended to the whole DP afi
d . Indeed, as it was observed in [C4, Section 6],
e.g. for F = k∗(I) ∈ DP af1
, computing the both sides of the postulated iso-
morphism gives diﬀerent results.

d . In fact a genuine Serre functor exisists only on DP afi,b

In this subsection we introduce (a suitably modiﬁed version of) Serre functor
in DP afi
but this
is not very useful for us since the objects of DP afi
rarely have coﬁbrant
d
replacements in DP afi,b
. On the other hand one cannot hope for existing of
a Serre functor in DP afi
d , since it is not even a Hom–ﬁnite category. What
we really have is the following weaker version of Serre functor:

Deﬁnition 3.3 Let C be a k–linear category. A k–linear functor S : C −→ C
is a weak (left) Serre functor if:

1. There is a natural in X, Y isomorphism

HomC(S(X), Y ) ≃ HomC(Y, X)∗

whenever X or Y is compact.

2. S is an auto–equivalence.

For example, if C is the bounded derived category of category of ﬁnitely
generated modules over a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of ﬁnite homological
dimension then by [BV] C posses a Serre functor.
In that case, it is easy
to see that it extends to a weak Serre functor. However, our situation is
quite diﬀerent, since P afi
is of inﬁnite homological dimension. The crucial
property of DP afi
d which makes a construction analogous to that used in
Section 2 working is the following technical fact:

Let P • be a ﬁnite projective resolution of Sd

U ∗ in Pd. Then

h∗(P •) ≃ h∗(Sd

U ∗) = c∗

U ⊗Ai.

Since h∗ ≃ t∗[2d(pi − 1)] by [C4, Prop. 2.4.5] and t∗ preserves coﬁbrant
objects, h∗(P •) is a coﬁbrant replacement of c∗
U ⊗Ai. To conclude the proof
we observe that since P • is ﬁnite, h∗(P •) is compact.

Now we can deﬁne the aﬃne Serre functor in a manner analogous to that
used in Section 2.

11

Deﬁnition 3.5 We deﬁne a functor S : DP afi

Safi(F )(V ⊗ Ai) := HomDP

(c∗

We collect the basic properties of Safi which will be needed for the applica-
tions described in Section 5.

Theorem 3.6 The functor Safi satisﬁes the following properties:

1. There is a natural in U ⊗ Ai isomorphism in P afi

Safi(c∗

U ⊗Ai) ≃ hU ⊗Ai.

2. Safi is an auto–equivalence of DP afi

is a left Serre functor and it is a weak left

4. There are isomorphisms of functors

Safi ◦ z∗[2d(pi − 1)] ≃ z∗ ◦ S, S ◦ t∗ ≃ t∗ ◦ Safi[2d(pi − 1)],

Safi ◦ Kaf ≃ Kaf ◦ S, S ◦ Cafi ≃ Caf ◦ Safi.

Proof: Since c∗

U ⊗Ai is ﬁbrant in the injective Quillen structure we get

Saf (c∗

(c∗

V ⊗Ai, c∗

In order to get the second part we deﬁne “the right aﬃne Serre functor” Safi
by the formula

r

Safi

r (F )(V ⊗ Ai) := HomP

afi
d

(F, hV ⊗Ai)∗.

r (hU ⊗Ai) = c∗

Then by the computation analogous to that giving the ﬁrst part we show
that Safi
coming
from the Yoneda lemma is an isomorphsim for hU ⊗Ai. Hence Safiand Safi
are mutually inverse on DP afi,b
. Since, by Proposition 3.4, Safi commutes
with inﬁnite direct colimits, it is an equivalence on the whole DP afi

In order to obtain the ﬁrst isomorphism in part 4, we recall that z∗(Γd

U ∗) =
U ⊗Ai[−2d(pi − 1)]. Hence we get natural in U isomor-

and

z∗ ◦ S(Sd

(U ⊗Ai)∗[−2d(pi − 1)].

The second isomorphism follows from the facts that t∗(c∗

The proof of the last two isomorphisms is analogous to that of Proposition
3.2. The last formula holds on the whole DP afi
d because Cafi commutes with
inﬁnite direct limits.

U ⊗Ai) = Sd

(U ⊗Ai)∗ and

Remark: When we compose the isomorphisms from part 4, we obtain the
formulae:

S ◦ Kr ≃ Kr ◦ S[2d(pi − 1)], S ◦ C ≃ C ◦ S[−2d(pi − 1)],

from which, in particular, Theorem 2.2.3.1 follows. Thus we see that this
shift phenomenon which produces the Poincar´e duality is related to the scalar
extension from Pd to P afi

.

conjecture that P afi
is stratiﬁed by these subcategories. This structure may
be interesting for its own but in the present article we are mainly interested
in the Serre functor restricted to the semiblocks, since, as it will be shown in
the next section, in certain cases it enjoys very special properties.
We recall that the category Pd admits decmopsition into the blocks:

Pd ≃ Pλ1 × . . . × Pλs

and the set of blocks is indexed by the family λ1, . . . , λs of p–core Young
diagrams of weight d − pj for some j ≥ 0. By the Yoneda lemma, there is
the corresponding decomposition of the bifunctor (V, W ) 7→ Γd(Hom(W, V ))
into the “block bifunctors”:

Γd(Hom(W, V )) ≃ Bλ1(V, W ) ⊕ . . . Bλs(V, W ).

The Cauchy decomposition [ABW, Th. III.1.4] provides the ﬁltration of bi-
functor Γd(Hom(W, V )) with the associated object

M

µ∈Yd

Wµ(V ) ⊗ Wµ(W ∗)

where Yd stands for the set of Young diagrams of weight d. Hence each
Bλ(V, W ) has the ﬁltration with the associated object

M

µ∈Yλj

Wµ(V ) ⊗ Wµ(W ∗)

where Yλ is the set of Young diagrams of degree d belonging to the block
labeled by λj.
Moreover, the bifunctor Bλj can be used to form the category Bλj V whose
objects are ﬁnite vector spaces and

HomBλj V(V, W ) := Bλj (W, V ).

Then the category Pλj can be identiﬁed with the category of k–linear func-
tors from Bλj V to the category of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over k.
The main objective of the present section is to deﬁne the aﬃne counterpart
of Pλ, relate it to Pλ and Pdpi, and equip it with a Serre functor.
Let us ﬁx a p–core Young diagram λ of wieght |λ| = d − pj and let B(i)

λ

14

denote the bifunctor (V, W ) 7→ Bλ(V (i), W ). We introduce the graded cate-
gory BλVAi with the objects being ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces and the
morphisms given by the formula

HomBλV (V ⊗ Ai, V ′ ⊗ Ai) := Ext∗

P

dpi (B(i)

λ (−, V ′), B(i)

λ (−, V ))

where we choose to label the objects by V ⊗Ai in order to make our terminol-
ogy coherent with that used in Section 3 and [C4]. Thanks to the Collapsing
Conjecture [C3, Cor. 3.7] the Hom–spaces in BλVAi admit a more explicit
description. Namely, we have natural in V, V ′ isomorphisms

Ext∗

P

dpi (B(i)

λ (−, V ′), B(i)

λ (−, V )) ≃ Ext∗

Pd(Bλ(−, V ′), Bλ(− ⊗ Ai, V )) ≃

Bλ(V ′ ⊗ Ai, V ).

With this description the composition in BλVAi is given as the composite of
the scalar extension:

Bλ(V ′′⊗Ai, V ′)⊗Bλ(V ′⊗Ai, V ) −→ Bλ(V ′′⊗Ai⊗Ai, V ′⊗Ai)⊗Bλ(V ′⊗Ai, V ),

the composition in BλV:

Bλ(V ′′ ⊗ Ai ⊗ Ai, V ′ ⊗ Ai) ⊗ Bλ(V ′ ⊗ Ai, V ) −→ Bλ(V ′′ ⊗ Ai ⊗ Ai, V )

and the morphism

Bλ(V ′′ ⊗ Ai ⊗ Ai, V ) −→ Bλ(V ′′ ⊗ Ai, V )

induced by the multiplication Ai ⊗ Ai −→ Ai. We then deﬁne P afi
as the
category of graded k–linear functors from BλVAi to the category of Z–graded
bounded below ﬁnite dimensional in each degree vector spaces.

be the natural embedding and

πλ : Γd(Hom(W, V ⊗ Ai)) −→ Bλ(V ⊗ Ai, W )

be the natural projection. Then the composite ǫλ := iλ ◦πλ can be thought of
as an idempotent endofunctor on ΓdVAi (being the identity on the objects).
Thus the category BλVAi can be identiﬁed with the category ǫλ(ΓdVAi)ǫλ
whose objects are those of ΓdVAi but

Homǫλ(ΓdVAi )ǫλ(V, V ′) := ǫλ(HomΓdVAi

(V, V ′))ǫλ.

Then the assignement

(V, V ′) 7→ ǫλ(HomΓdVAi

(V, V ′))

deﬁnes a ΓdVAi × BλVAi–bimodule in the terminoloy of [K1, Sect. 6]. Hence
we get a pair of functors j ∗

λ, jλ∗ which satisfy the following properties.

Proposition 4.2

1. The functor jλ∗ is right adjoint to j ∗
λ.

2. The functor j ∗

λ : P afi

λ −→ P afi

d

is a full embedding.

Proof: The adjunction follows from the machinery of standard functors
developed in [K1, Sect. 6]. The full embedding follows from the fact that
j ∗
λ ◦ jλ∗ ≃ id.

Let us remark that Proposition 4.2 may be thought of as a categoriﬁcation

16

of [CPS, Prop. 2.1]. This explains our choice of notations with j ∗, j∗ instead
of HX, TX used in [K1]. In fact we could derive Proposition 4.2 directly from
[CPS, Prop. 2.1] by invoking our Proposition 4.1 but we prefer to consistently
work in functor categories. We also mention that Proposition 4.2 carries over
to the level of derived categories which was the main objective of [K1] and
[CPS] and which will be discussed in the next paragraph.
Namely, we deﬁne DP af
in the
manner analogous to that in Section 3. The adjunctions {z∗
λ, jλ∗}
carry over to the derived categories and, as we have already mentioned, the
analog of the second part of Proposition 4.2 holds, i.e. we have the full
embedding

which allows us to regard DP afi

Now we would like to to construct a block version of the aﬃne derived
Kan extension in order to relate DP afi
to DP pid. For this we need an analog
λ
of the formality result [C4, Th. 4.2]. Let Xλ be a projective resolution of B(i)
dpi. We introduce a DG category ΓdVXλ with the objects being ﬁnite
in P d
dimensional vector spaces and

λ

HomΓdVXλ

(V, V ′) := HomPdp(Xλ(−, V ′), Xλ(−, V )).

Then BλVAi is clearly the cohomology category of ΓdVXλ but we have a much
stronger result (c.f. [C4, Th. 4.2]):

Proposition 4.4 The identity on the objects extends to an equivalence of
DG categories φλ : BλVAi ≃ ΓdVXλ.
Proof: Since Γd(I (i) ⊗ I ∗) ≃ B(i)
λ ⊕ B′, we can obtain X, the projective
resolution of Γd(I (i) ⊗ I ∗), as the direct sum X = Xλ ⊕ X ′ of projective
resolutions of B(i)

λ and B′. Let

iλ : Ext∗

Pdp(B(i)

be the embedding induced by the decomposition Γd(I (i) ⊗ I ∗) ≃ B(i)
λ ⊕ B′ (we
have already encountered this embedding when constructing the idempotent
functor ǫλ). Let us deﬁne similarly the projection

eπλ : HomPdp(X(−, V ′), X(−, V )) −→ HomPdp(Xλ(−, V ′)Xλ(−, V )).

We deﬁne φλ : BλVAi −→ ΓdVXλ as the composite φλ := eπλ ◦ φ ◦ iλ where
φ : ΓdVAi −→ ΓdVX is the transformation from [C4, Theroem 4.2] or rather
its multitwist analog (in fact this generalization is not entirely trivial, we refer
the reader to [C5, Theorem 3.1] where an analogous construction is conducted
in even greater generality). Then the fact that φλ is an equivalence easily
follows from the fact that φ is an equivalence and that it commutes with the
idempotent ǫλ := iλ ◦ πλ and its ΓdVXλ–analog eǫλ := eiλ ◦ eπλ.
Thanks to Proposition 4.4 we are able to construct the block aﬃne derived
Kan extension. We summarize its basic properties below

Proposition 4.5 There exist functors Cafi
λ
DP dpi −→ DP afi

: DP afi
satisfying the following properties:

λ

λ −→ DP dpi and Kafi

λ

:

1. Kafi
λ

is right adjoint to Cafi
λ .

2. Cafi
λ

is a full embedding.

3. The functors Cafi
λ

(restricted to DP afi,b

λ

) and Kafi
λ

commute with the

Kuhn duality.

4. There are isomorphisms of functors:

Cafi ◦ jλ∗ ≃ Cafi
λ ,

λ ◦ Kafi ≃ Kafi
j ∗
λ .

The proofs of parts 1, 2, 3 are analogous to those of [C4, Th. 5.1] and our
Proposition 3.2. The compatibilty formula in part 3 follows immediately
from the constuction of the considered functors.

Having at our disposal the block aﬃne drived Kan extension we can oﬀer a
better explanation of the phenomenon of non–orthogonality of semiblocks.
Namely let us take F ∈ Pλ, G ∈ Pλ′ for λ 6= λ′. Then

Hom∗

(j ∗

λ(F )), j ∗

λ′(z∗

λ(F ))), Cafi(j ∗

λ′(z∗

λ′(G)))) ≃

≃ Ext∗

P

dpi (F (i), G(i))

and the latter Ext–groups may well be non–trivial. Thus we see that the
reason for the non–orthogonality of semiblocks is simply that the Frobenius
twist transfers all the blocks from Pd into the single (pricipal) block in Pdpi.
Still, the block decomposition on Pd when pushed to P afi
generates certain
structure on the latter category.
(and its
derived category) a stratiﬁcation with the set of strata indexed by the blocks
of Pd but we defer a deeper study of semiblock structure to a future work.
We ﬁnish this section by endowing the category DP afi
λ with a Serre functor.
This may be achieved by a construction analogous to that given in the global
(aﬃne) case.

It seems that we have on P afi

5 Calabi–Yau structure on basic aﬃne blocks

is isomorphic to the shift functor.

In this section we show that the aﬃne Serre functor when restricted to certain
semiblocks in DP afi
d
We recall that a block in Pd is called basic if it contains a single simple object.
Hence the basic blocks are indexed by p–core Young diagrams of weight d
and we also call such Young diagrams basic. So, let us ﬁx a basic Young
diagram λ. Then Sλ ≃ Wλ ≃ Fλ. Moreover, Sλ is injective and projective
and every object of Pλ is a direct sum of Sλ, therefore the category Pλ is
semisimple.
We recall that a triangulated category T with a Serre functor ST is called
Calabi–Yau of dimension n if there is an isomorphism of functors ST ≃ id[n].
Then we call a triangulated category T weak Calabi–Yau of dimension n if
it has a weak Serre functor ST such that ST ≃ id[n].

λ

Proof: The theorem is a formal consequence of the following properties of
the bifunctor Bλ (the crucial second property is speciﬁc to basic blocks).

Lemma 5.2 There are the following isomorphisms of bifunctors:

1. Bλ(V, W ⊗ Ai) ≃ Bλ(V ⊗ A∗

i , W ) for any λ.

2. Bλ(V, W ) ≃ Sλ(V ) ⊗ Sλ(W ∗) for basic λ.

Proof of the Lemma We recall that

Bλ(V, W ) = HomPd(Bλ(−, W ), Bλ(−, V ))

and a general fact that

HomPd(F (− ⊗ X), G) ≃ HomPd(F, G(− ⊗ X ∗))

for any graded space X and F, G ∈ Pd. This gives the ﬁrst isomorphism.
The second isomorphism immediately follows from the Cauchy decomposition
and the fact that Sλ ≃ Wλ for basic λ.

We recall that we deal with left Serre functors, hence we should show that

20

λ ≃ id[−2d(pi − 1)].

Safi
Since

Safi

λ (F )(V ⊗ Ai) := RHomP

afi
λ

(c∗

λ,V , F )

and by the Yoneda lemma

F (V ⊗ Ai) := RHomP

afi
λ

(hV

λ , F ),

it suﬃces to ﬁnd a natural in V isomorphism

c∗
λ,V ≃ hV

λ [2d(pi − 1)].

On one hand we have:

hV
λ (W ) = HomBλVAi

(V, W ) = (Bλ(W ⊗ Ai, V )) ≃ Sλ(W ⊗ Ai) ⊗ Sλ(V ∗),

on the other hand:

c∗
λ,V (W ) = (HomBλVAi

(W, V ))∗ = (Bλ(V ⊗ Ai, W ))∗ ≃ (Bλ(V, W ⊗ A∗

i ))∗ ≃

(Sλ(V ) ⊗ Sλ(W ∗ ⊗ Ai))∗ = Sλ(V ∗) ⊗ Sλ(W ⊗ A∗

i ).

Since A∗

i ≃ Ai[2(pi − 1)] we have an isomorphism of functors

Sλ(− ⊗ A∗

i ) ≃ Sλ(− ⊗ Ai)[2d(pi − 1)]

which completes the proof.

of a single block which is obviously basic.

This fact has the following global generalization.

d

21

Proof: In fact for d < p all the blocks in Pd are basic but since P afi
is not
a product of its aﬃne semiblocks, our statement cannot be directly deduced
from Theorem 5.1. Instead one can repeat the proof of Theorem 5.1 in the
present context. The crucial fact is that Γd ≃ Sd if d < p. We leave the
straightforward details to the reader.

d

As we have said in the Introduction, the Calabi–Yau structure on DP afi
λ
provides sort of categorical interpretation of the Poincar´e duality. Hence it
is not surprising that one can deduce Corollary 2.4 from Theorem 5.1 (and
the compatibilty of the (block ) aﬃne derived Kan extension with the Kuhn
duality).
Namely, by the block aﬃne derived Kan extension we obtain

Of course this approach is technically much more involved than that taken in
Section 2, but it shows how classical and aﬃne phenomena are related and
also explains why we insist on considering weak Serre functors.
We ﬁnish our paper by providing description of P afi
as a category of graded
λ
modules over certain explicitly described graded algebra. Of course, for any

22

λ

λ, the category P afi
is equivalent to the category of graded modules over
the block aﬃne Schur algebra by Proposition 4.1, but this fact is not very
useful in practice, since this graded algebra is quite complicated. However,
in the case of basic block the situation massively simpliﬁes. First of all, as
we observed in Lemma 5.2 we have an isomorphism of graded vector spaces

Bλ(kd ⊗ Ai, kd) ≃ Sλ(kd ⊗ Ai) ⊗ Sλ(kd∗).

However, in order to understand the multplicative structure it is better to
take a bit diiferent point of view. Namely, by Lemma 5.2 we have decompo-
sition

Bλ(−, kd) ≃

sλ,dM

Sλ

where sλ,d = dim(Sλ(kd)). Let us deﬁne a graded algebra

j=1

Ai,λ := Ext∗

P

dpi (S(i)

Then we have isomorphisms of graded algebras

Bλ(kd⊗Ai, kd) ≃ Ext∗

P

dpi (

Since any matrix algebra is Morita equivalent to the ground algebra, we
obtain

Proposition 5.5 For any basic Young diagram λ, the categories P afi
Ai,λ − grmod are equivalent.

λ

and

At last, let us take a look at the graded algebra Ai,λ. Firstly, by the Collapsing
Conjecture

Ai,λ ≃ HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai).

The dimension of the latter algebra can be explicitly expressed in terms of
the Littlewood–Richardson numbers. This point of view also allows one to
describe the multiplication:
it comes as the composite of scalar extension,
Hom–multiplication and multiplication in Ai:

HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai) ⊗ HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai) −→

23

HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai) ⊗ HomPd(Sλ⊗Ai, Sλ,Ai⊗Ai) −→ HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai⊗Ai) −→

HomPd(Sλ, Sλ,Ai).

A bit diﬀerent description of Ai,λ is perhaps even more down to earth. It
follows from the fact that since Sλ is a direct summand in I d, there exists an
idempotent eλ ∈ k[Σd] such that Sλ = eλI d. Therefore we get

Ai,λ ≃ eλ(Ext∗

P

dpi (I d(i), I d(i)))eλ ≃ eλ(A⊗d

i ⊗ k[Σd])eλ.

A subtle point here is that even if we would take the whole Sλ–isotypical
summand in I d and the corresponding central idempotent e′
λ is not
central in the algebra A⊗d
i ⊗ k[Σd]. Hence Ai,λ is not Morita equivalent to a
direct factor in A⊗d
i ⊗ k[Σd]. This is another manifestation of the fact that
aﬃne semiblocks are not genuine blocks.
All these descriptions drastically simplify for d = 1.
obtain

In this case we just
