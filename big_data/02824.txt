We study the evolution of perpendicularly magnetized tunnel junctions under 300 to 400 ◦C annealing. The
hysteresis loops do not evolve much during annealing and they are not informative of the underlying structural
evolutions. These evolutions are better revealed by the frequencies of the ferromagnetic resonance eigenmodes
of the tunnel junction. Their modeling provides the exchange couplings and the layers’ anisotropies within the
stack which can serve as a diagnosis of the tunnel junction state after each annealing step. The anisotropies of
the two CoFeB-based parts and the two Co/Pt-based parts of the tunnel junction decay at different rates during
annealing. The ferromagnet exchange coupling through the texture-breaking Ta layer fails above 375◦C. The Ru
spacer meant to promote a synthetic antiferromagnet behavior is also insufﬁciently robust to annealing. Based
on these evolutions we propose optimization routes for the next generation tunnel junctions.

Spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memories
(STT-MRAM) are considered to have the potential to become
a uniﬁed non-volatile memory for embedded applications as
it simultaneously can serve as a working memory and a stor-
age memory for code and data1. This technology is based on
perpendicularly magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)
that are grown at the back end of line of CMOS and must thus
sustain the associated 400 ◦C ﬁnal anneal. In addition to the
free layer that stores the information, state-of-the-art MTJs2
rely on composite ﬁxed systems that comprise many layers.
A generic ﬁxed system comprises three parts: a FeCoB-based
layer in contact with MgO to ensure optimal spin transport
properties, a high anisotropy multilayer that pins it through a
coupling layer, and another hard multilayer coupled antifer-
romagnetically. The two hard multilayers are constructed in
a synthetic ferrimagnet conﬁguration to avoid the generation
of stray ﬁelds that would destabilize the free layer and lead to
asymmetric switching properties3,4. Each magnetic layer and
each coupling layer requires a careful optimization5 and must
keep its properties upon annealing which is a challenging ob-
jective upon active investigation6–9. Unfortunately, the prop-
erties of the individual layers cannot easily be isolated and
determined to guide further material optimization. In conven-
tional magnetometry methods the information on the free and
ﬁxed systems is intertwined. Most often the MTJ function-
ality can only be measured at the device level with potential
artefacts from patterning damages. When the junction in in-
operative, it is often difﬁcult to backtrace to the problem.

In this paper, we study the annealing evolution of each part
of a state of the art MTJ based on Co/Pt multilayers, which
are thought to be more temperature resistant than Co/Pd10 or
Co/Ni based systems11. We use vector network analyzer fer-
romagnetic resonance (FMR) to measure the stack eigenexci-
tations up to 2.5 T and 70 GHz and model them to deduce the
anisotropies and the interlayer coupling of the essential layers
of the MTJ at various stages of annealing. The identiﬁcation
of the most critical layers can be used to deﬁne optimization
routes for the next generation magnetic tunnel junctions.

Our objective is to understand the evolution of the ﬁxed
layers of perpendicularly magnetization MTJ upon high tem-

perature annealing. For this, we use bottom-pinned MTJs
(Fig. 1(a), inset) of the following conﬁguration12: seed / Hard
Layer / Ru / Reference Layer / Ta / Spin Polarizing Layer /
MgO (RA=6.5 Ω.µm2, TMR =150 %)/ Free Layer / cap, with
compositions described in Table I. We study the ﬁxed layers
in state-of-the-art MTJs, i.e.
including a free layer. This is
meant to reﬂect the real environment of the ﬁxed layers; in-
deed the properties of the ﬁxed layer system (crystallization,
thermal robustness...) can be inﬂuenced by the free layer on
top. Our ﬁxed system is constructed in a synthetic ferrimagnet
conﬁguration as commonly practiced for stray ﬁeld compen-
sation. It consists of three parts (Fig. 1(a), inset): the 1.1 nm
thick FeCoB spin polarizing layer (PL) whose ﬁxed character
is ensured by a ferromagnetic coupling with the Co/Pt based
reference layer (RL) though a Ta spacer. The RL is hardened
by an antiferromagnetic coupling with a thicker Co-Pt based
hard layer (HL) through a Ru spacer. All samples have been
annealed at 300◦C for 30 minutes in a ﬁeld of 1 Tesla, fol-
lowed by a rapid thermal annealing of 10 minutes at Ta =
350, 375 or 400◦C.

Below and at Ta = 350◦C, the easy axis loops [Fig. 1(a-
c)] conﬁrm that all layers have perpendicular magnetization.
The PL and the RL are rigidly coupled and they switch in syn-
chrony, which relates to the ferromagnetic interlayer exchange
coupling JTa > 0 though Ta. The negative sign of their coer-
civity recalls their antiferromagnetic coupling JRu < 0 with
the HL. These two features are maintained upon annealing at
the ﬁrst two temperatures, until a partial decoupling of the
RL and the PL appears. The loop after 300 and 350 ◦C are
almost indiscernible [Fig. 1(a-b)] and possess perfectly hor-
izontal plateau when the {RL+PL} ensemble is antiparallel
to the HL, disregarding the state of the FL). After the tough-
est annealing, there is a faint reduction of the HL coercivity.
While this could originate either from a decrease of the HL
anisotropy or from a decrease of the exchange through Ru we
will see later that it results from a combination of the two ef-
fects. In addition, a rounding of the coercivity of the {PL +
RL} ensemble is observed, and a slope and an opening ap-
pear at low ﬁelds. This is indicative of some reduction of
the anisotropies within the {PL + RL} ensemble and indicates

FIG. 1. Properties of the MTJ after 300, 350 and 400◦C annealing. (a), (b) and (c): easy axis loops. (d), (e) and (f): imaginary part of the
magnetic permeability (color, arbitrary scale) versus out-of-plane ﬁeld and frequency during a downwards ﬁeld sweep. The change of contrast

that these two layers do not switch in synchrony any longer.
Transport properties deduced from current-in-plane-tunneling
experiments at ±40 mT indicate that the tunnel magnetoresis-
tance is optimal after annealing at 350 and 375◦C. We could
not determine to what extent the decrease of TMR at higher
annealing was due to a degradation of the spin-transport prop-
erties or to a partial loss of perpendicular anisotropy within the

PL. Annealing renders the oxide barrier more resistive (Table
I).

All in all, the hysteresis loops show limited evolutions upon
annealing and the tiny changes are hard to interpret. This
does not mean that the MTJ do not evolve upon annealing; in-
deed the coercivities are usually extrinsic and cannot be used
in general to assess the values of the intrinsic properties like

anisotropy and interlayer exchange. We will see hereafter that
the stack properties change substantially even if the loops do
not reﬂect it. The intrinsic properties can be inferred from the
MTJ’s ferromagnetic resonance eigenexcitations13. The dy-
namical magnetization properties were determined by vector
network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR14) in
the open-circuit total reﬂection conﬁguration15. The suscepti-
bility spectra Fig. 1(d-f)] were recorded for ﬁelds up to 2.5 T
and frequencies in the 1-70 GHz interval with post-treatments
described in ref. 16.

The MTJ comprises four parts and thus it should yield four
resonances. Unfortunately we could only detect three modes.
The V-shaped modes [Fig. 1(d-f), green labels] with narrow
linewidths bend at the free layer coercivity and must thus be
assigned to the FL. The FL properties can be deduced follow-
ing a straightforward analysis as conducted in many places16.
The other modes are affected by the exchange through Ru and
Ta such that they involve magnetization motion in all three
parts of the ﬁxed system. For reasons that will become clear
upon modeling, we refer the highest frequency mode as HL
mode (blue labels) and to the lowest frequency mode as the
optical {RL+PL} mode (orange labels).
Upon annealing, the optical {RL+PL} mode decreases by typ-
ically 5 GHz per annealing step in both the parallel (P) and
antiparallel (AP) conﬁgurations. The ”HL” mode is ﬁrst unaf-
fected then decreases by 2 GHz at 375◦C (not shown) in both
high ﬁeld (P) and low ﬁeld (AP) states. It then collapses by
-19 GHz at the last annealing step in the AP state, and by -5
GHz in P. This pronounced difference between the P and AP
conﬁgurations is indicative of a dramatic decrease of the an-
tiferromagnetic coupling through Ru. None of the detected
modes softens at the loops’ characteristic ﬁelds. While this
is expected at the coercivity of the HL which is anticipated
to be extrinsic, it is surprising at the coercivity of the {PL +
RL} ensemble where the antiferromagnetic coupling gener-
ally promotes a more reversible behavior13.

To get the quantitative properties of each part of the MTJ,
we have ﬁtted the observed mode frequencies to that of cou-
pled macrospins. The ground state and the eigenexcitations
of the ﬁxed system are found in a manner similar to that of
ref. 17, i.e. by staying in the energy minimum during a ﬁeld
sweep and then by linearizing the LLG equations about the
energy minima to infer the eigenexcitations of the system. We
will assume that these modes arise from the 3 layers (PL, RL
and HL) with their unknown anisotropies. The layers are cou-
pled through interlayer exchange coupling factors J through
Ta and Ru (Table I) that act as two unknown coupling ﬁelds of
the form J/(Mst). Apart from that of the hard layer, the mag-
netizations were considered constant during annealing since
the other properties seem to evolve much more.

We have 5 unknowns (the PL, RL and HL anisotropies and
two coupling ﬁelds) and 5 relevant data (two frequencies in
the parallel (high ﬁeld) state, two others in the antiparallel
state and one coercivity). We indeed constraint the ﬁts to get
the correct coercivity for the {PL + RL} ensemble. For a fast
and intuitive convergence, we use the precession eigenvec-
tors to identify the parameters that inﬂuence the most a given
mode. Let us illustrate this on the optic mode at high ﬁelds

nealing. (a) : Simulated hysteresis loop of the {PL, RL, HL} ensem-
ble. (b) : Eigenmode frequencies. The circles are the experimental
data extracted for increasing ﬁelds. The bold and dashed lines are
the modeled frequencies predicted at increasing and decreasing ﬁeld
scans. The vectors denote the relative precession amplitude within
the PL (ﬁrst component), the RL and the HL (last component) in the
collinear states.

(Fig. 2, orange curve). The relative amplitudes of precession
are 70 in the PL, -9 in the RL and 3 in the HL. As a result, its
frequency is thus much more inﬂuenced by the anisotropies
of the PL and the RL than from that of the HL which hosts
only a very tiny precession amplitude. Correlatively, the fre-
quency of this mode is much more inﬂuenced by JTa than by
JRu. Since the PL and RL precess with phase opposition (op-
tical excitation), we name this mode ”optic {RL+PL}”.
In
contrast, the mode named ”acoustic” (Fig. 2, red curve) is
named so because it implies precessions that are well dis-
tributed and in-phase in the {RL+PL} ensemble. This mode is
not detected experimentally except indirectly by the switching
that it triggers when softening. Finally, the highest frequency
mode (blue curve) is mainly hosted by the hard layer, hence
its name.

The above approach was used to determine each layer’s
properties and their interlayer exchange coupling factors (Ta-
ble I). In line with the conclusions of other studies18–22, the
anisotropy of the free layer is ﬁrst improved, until it degrades
above 375◦C. The FeCoB spin polarizing layer has the same
nominal composition but its anisotropy degrades much ear-
lier. This is probably linked to the lower crystalline quality of
the spin polarizing layer that results from the fcc to bcc tex-
ture transition in the underlying Ta spacer. Noteworthy, the
spin polarizing layer would be in-plane magnetized at soon

as Ta ≥ 325◦C without the coupling with the reference layer
through Ta, as found already in similar systems23 .
The coupling through Ta is moderate and it decays substan-
tially above 350◦C to become too weak to hold together the
RL and the PL. Regarding the thermal budget, the Ta spacer
is thus a weak point in the stack. The anisotropy of the Co/Pt
hard layer of the MTJ degrades for annealing above 375◦C
but the magnetizations stays perpendicular for all annealing
conditions. At ﬁrst the decay of the anisotropy is compen-
sated by a joint decrease of the magnetization, such that only
the coupling ﬁeld though Ru can unravel these two evolutions.
The joint decrease of magnetization and anisotropy is proba-
bly indicative of a gradual intermixing of the Co and Pt layers,
which decreases the abruptness of the interfaces and conse-
quently the interface anisotropy within the Co/Pt-based hard
layer24. The anisotropy of the Co/Pt reference layer of the
MTJ is substantially weaker than that of the hard layers. This
does not necessarily indicate a worse texture when grown on
the Ru spacer than when grown on optimized seed layers; in-
deed our experience is that the main determinant to achieve
high anisotropy is the number of repeats within Co/Pt multi-
layers. The anisotropy ﬁeld of the RL also degrades upon an-
nealing. Finally, the interlayer exchange coupling through Ru
is initially very strong but it decays regularly. It thus consti-
tutes also a part of the stack that needed improvement to meet
the constraints of the thermal budget. This decay is consistent

with older studies18 done on in-plane magnetized systems.

In summary, we have studied the evolution of perpendic-
ularly magnetized tunnel junctions upon annealing up to 400
◦C. The hysteresis loops do not evolve much during annealing
and cannot reveal the underlying structural evolutions. The
ferromagnetic resonance eigenmodes indicate however sub-
stantial evolutions within the stack, with signiﬁcant lower-
ing of the anisotropies of both the Co/Pt-based parts and of
the CoFeB-based parts of the tunnel junction. The exchange
coupling through Ta is not robust to annealing at 400◦C,
which argues for advanced texture breaking layers enriched
with Co and Fe that seem to promote stronger ferromag-
netic coupling9,25 . The antiferromagnetic exchange coupling
through Ru is also decaying regularly. This diagnosis argues
for the use of thinner Ru spacers close to the ﬁrst antiferro-
magnetic exchange maximum at 0.48 nm,26 to start from a
higher coupling. Another option is the insertion of Pt dopants
around the Ru spacer27 which could increase the anisotropies
of the Co/Pt multilayers by suppressing the suboptimal con-
tribution of the Co/Ru interfaces28. This would also provide
extra resistance to annealing27 with a marginal decrease of
interlayer exchange coupling. An additional research route
would be to replace Ru spacers by Rh spacers that exhibit gi-
ant interlayer exchange coupling29,30 but whose resistance to
annealing is yet to be explored.
