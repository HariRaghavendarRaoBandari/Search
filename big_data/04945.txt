Abstract

Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism behind the evolution of cooperation. Oishi et al. analyt-

ically showed the formation of two exclusive groups under the KANDORI assessment rule in the

case of perfect information and no implementation error, regardless of the population size N . Here,

we numerically show the formation of many exclusive groups under the JUDGING assessment rule

in the same case. Introducing degrees of exclusive groups, we numerically examine the stability of

the group formation under imperfect information and implementation error.

INTRODUCTION

Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism driving the evolution of cooperation.[1] One fea-

ture of indirect reciprocity is that helpful acts are returned, not by the recipient as in direct

reciprocation, but by third parties: players collect information about other player’s behavior,

and determine their actions by using this information. This behavior requires the following

two modules: (a) an assessment rule for the acts of others as good or bad, and (b) an action

rule specifying how to act toward others based on that assessment.

Assessment rules are classiﬁed into three types, depending on what information they use.

A ﬁrst-order assessment rule only takes into account whether a donor X helps a recipient

Y . A second-order assessment rule takes also into account the image of the recipient Y . A

third-order assessment rule additionally takes into account the image of the donor X.

Assuming binary assessments, Ohtsuki and Iwasa [2, 3] showed that among the resulting

possible strategies, only eight lead to a stable regime of mutual cooperation under public

and perfect information about others. These are called the leading eight.

On the other hand, Uchida [4] examined the eﬀects of private and imperfect information as

well as those of implementation errors. Although Uchida concluded that private information

leads to the collapse of the sterner (KANDORI[5]) assessment rule, the results presented

here are somewhat diﬀerent.

Oishi et. al.[6] showed the emergence of two exclusive groups in the JUDGING assessment

rule when information is perfect and private.

In this study, we numerically examine the

stability of the exclusive groups under imperfect information and implementation errors.

Furthermore, we numerically show the emergence of many exclusive groups in the third-

order (JUDGING) assessment rule.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

We consider the donation game deﬁned as follows: there are N players, each with their

own opinion as to whether each of the other players is good (G) or bad (B) (image matrix).

βij(t) ∈ G, B represents player i’s opinion of player j at a round t. Each element of the

image matrix at the initial round t = 1, is G with probability p or B with probability 1 − p.

The probability p is called the initial trust probability and 0 < p < 1.

2

The game is repeated over a large number of rounds.

In each round, one player is

randomly chosen as a donor and another as a recipient. It is the donor’ choice whether to

cooperate or defect. We assume the decision follows an action rule. If the donor cooperates,

the payoﬀ of the donor, −c, is less than 0 and that of the recipient, b, is greater than 0. If

the donor defects, the payoﬀs of both players are 0. We assume b ≥ c.

All players observe which player is the donor, which is the recipient, and what the donor

does to the recipient. Then, all players independently revise their own opinion on the donor

based on the observation and their assessment rule.

Here we use only one action rule, namely that the donor only cooperates with recipients

whom the donor regards as good. On the other hand, we mainly study two assessment rules,

which are called the KANDORI and JUDGING ones. In Table 1, we show deﬁnitions of the

assessment rules used in this paper.

We consider two types of noises, following Uchida’s paper.[4] We investigate the eﬀect of

imperfect information, in which each interaction is only observed by a fraction, q < 1, of

the population. We also study the eﬀect of implementation error ǫ, which is the probability

that an intended help is not actually given.

III. RESULTS USING THE KANDORI ASSESSMENT RULE

First, we show our results in the case of the KANDORI assessment rule.

A. The case of q = 1 and ǫ = 0

We ﬁrst consider the case of perfect infomation, q = 1, and no implementation error,

ǫ = 0. Oishi et al.[6] analytically investigated this case and showed the formation of two

exclusive groups with ratios of p and 1 − p, irrespective of the population size, N.

B. The case of q < 1 and ǫ = 0

In this case, the results depend upon the initial state of the image matrix, βij(t = 1),

and the number of players, N. We consider two initial states of an image matrix for some p

(0 < p < 1), namely 1) a random initial state that is randomly set to G with a probability p

or B with a probabilty 1 − p, and 2) a uniform initial state where two exclusive groups with

ratios p and 1 − p are initially formed. In the latter case, we easily conﬁrm that imperfection

of the information, 1 − q, does not destroy the two exclusive groups.

In the former case, we can see that, after a large number of rounds and sorting (see

Appendix A), two imperfect exclusive groups still appear for small N and small 1 − q, as

seen in Fig. 1. Here, we introduce the degree of the two exclusive groups, DEG1, as follows:

DEG1 =

1
N 2

N
X
j=1

N
X
i=1

sign(β1j)β1iβji.

(1)

DEG1 is equal to one when the two exclusive groups are perfectly formed, and becomes

zero when they are destroyed.

In Fig. 2, the results of DEG1 versus q are shown for

N = 100, 200, and 400. For larger numbers of players, we can see that smaller values of the

incompleteness of the information, 1 − q, disturbs the formation of the two exclusive groups

from a random initial state.

C. The case of q = 1 and ǫ > 0

After a large number of rounds, two groups appear. Players within the same group have

the same opinions; those in diﬀerent groups have opposite opinions. The two groups are not

necessarily exclusive. In Fig. 3, we show that DEG1 linearly decreases with ǫ, irrespective

of the population size N.

D. The case of q < 1 and ǫ > 0

In contrast with the case of q < 1 and ǫ = 0, there is no dependence upon diﬀerent initial

states with the same p after a large number of rounds. In Fig. 4, the results of DEG1 versus

q are shown for N = 100, 200, and 400. We obtain results similar to the case where q < 1

and ǫ = 0 for a random initial state.

IV. RESULTS USING THE JUDGING ASSESSMENT RULE

We show results using the JUDGING assessment rule.

A. The case of q = 1 and ǫ = 0

Many exclusive groups are formed after a large number of rounds from a random initial

state at some p, where 0 < p < 1, as shown in Fig. 5. The sizes of these groups and their

frequencies depend upon p. Fig. 6 shows relations between group sizes and frequencies. The

larger the value of p, the greater the ease with which large groups are formed. When p is

small, it shows a behavior close to a power-low distribution. This distribution is almost the

same for diﬀerent population sizes N, as shown in Fig. 7.

Because DEG1 is only applicable to two exclusive groups, we introduce the following

DEG2 is one when many exclusive groups are perfectly formed, and zero when they are

destroyed.@

ǫ=0. The frequency is a sum over 200 samples for N =100 and over 100 samples for N =200.

B. The case of q < 1 and ǫ = 0

In this case, many smaller exclusive groups are formed from a random initial state (see

Fig. 8), although DEG2 still remains one. Once the formation of exclusive groups has

been completed, imperfection of information, 1 − q, does not change the state(i.e. the state

is stationary). This behavior results in a decrease in good assessments. Fig. 9 shows the

fraction of good assessments as a function of q.

C. The case of q = 1 and ǫ > 0

The degree of exclusive groups (DEG2) decreases almost linearly with ǫ, similar to the

case of the KANDORI assessment rule. This does not necessarily mean the collapse of the

group. As seen in Fig. 10, there are some white horizontal lines in addition to squares

representing the exclusive groups. This indicates that there are players to assess the players

in the diﬀerent group as good: i.e., the exclusivity of the group formed in this case is not

complete.

D. The case of q < 1 and ǫ > 0

The degree of the exclusive groups(DEG2) decreases and groups are destroyed. We also

examine the stability against mutants with diﬀerent assessment rules. We consider the world

of players with two or three diﬀerent assessment rules in Table 1, and compare the average

total payoﬀs. One example is shown in Fig. 11. The results show that, with the exception

of the STANDING mutants, the JUDGING players have a larger average payoﬀ than that

of the other mutants, although DEG2 decreases in the case of q < 1 and ǫ > 0.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We summarize the results of this study as follows:

1) In contrast with the claims of Uchida[4], imperfect information does not completely

destroy two exclusive groups in the KANDORI assessment rule. For a small population size

of N and small imperfect information 1 − q, two incomplete exclusive groups are formed.

10

2) Using the JUDGING assessment rule with q = 1 and ǫ = 0, many exclusive groups

appear from a random initial state with a trust probability p, where 0 < p < 1. Distributions

of the group sizes of exclusive groups show nearly power-law behaviors when p is small and

do not depend upon population size N. Incomplete information 1 − q does not decrease

the degree of exclusive groups (DEG2), but makes their group sizes smaller, resulting in an

increased number of bad assessments.

3) If b is suﬃciently larger than c, JUDGING players have larger average payoﬀs than

mutants (other than STANDING mutants) with diﬀerent assessment rules, as shown in

Table 1, even in the case where q < 1 and ǫ > 0.

The model investigated here has considerable limitations.

Introducing more realistic

eﬀects to the model may overcome the negative points of the JUDGING players (namely

smaller average payoﬀs than those of the STANDING players and an increased number of

bad assessments due to the incomplete information). One of the limitations is that players

have a very short memory: they determine their opinions of another player according to

their last observation of that player’s actions.

In real life, images are likely to be based

on a longer memory. In fact, we observe that introducing a longer memory to the model

makes the two exclusive groups of KANDORI players more robust under incompleteness of

information[7].

The other limitation is that the images are binary in this model, whereas the moral world

is not just black or white. Tanabe et al. [8] investigated the indirect reciprocity with trinary

reputations and found that this model allows cooperation under the SCORING assessment

rule under some mild conditions. We may expect an increase in good assessments for the

JUDGING players under the imperfect information by changing the binary images into

trinary ones.

Appendix A: Sorting image matrices

We sort image matrices to make their structure easier to see. First, matrices are sorted

based on the image of the ﬁrst row. The columns are also sorted in the same order. At

this time, a white square is formed in the upper left corner. In the case of the KANDORI

assessment rule, a white square is also formed in the lower right corner, and sorting is

completed. However, in the case of the JUDGING assessment rule, the lower right area has

not been sorted. Therefore, the lower right area is sorted in the same way. This process is

repeated until sorting becomes impossible. Finally, many white squares are formed on the

diagonal of the image matrix. In other words, the players are divided into many exclusive

groups.
