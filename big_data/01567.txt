Abstract

The conventional Wien ﬁlter is a device with orthogonal static magnetic and electric ﬁelds, often used for velocity
separation of charged particles. Here we describe the electromagnetic design calculations for a novel waveguide RF Wien
ﬁlter that will be employed to solely manipulate the spins of protons or deuterons at frequencies of about 0.1 to 2 MHz
at the COoler SYnchrotron COSY at J¨ulich. The device will be used in a future experiment that aims at measuring
the proton and deuteron electric dipole moments, which are expected to be very small. Their determination, however,
would have a huge impact on our understanding of the universe.

Keywords: Wien ﬁlter, parallel-plates waveguide, homogeneous electromagnetic ﬁeld, Lorentz force compensation

1. Introduction

Recently, the use of a Wien ﬁlter operated at radio
frequency (RF) has been proposed as a tool to search for
electric dipole moments (EDMs) of protons and deuterons
in storage rings [1, 2]. The occurrence of EDMs of ele-
mentary particles is intimately connected to the matter-
antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe [3], which
the Standard Model of elementary particle physics fails to
describe. A non-zero EDM measurement would point to
new physics beyond the Standard Model [4].

A Wien ﬁlter provides orthogonal electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds, usually generated by a parallel plate capac-
itor and encircling coils, such that the Lorentz force for
charged particles traveling with a speciﬁc velocity orthog-
onal to both ﬁelds vanishes [5]. This principle has found
widespread applications not only in mass spectrometers,
but also in electron microscopes and ion optics [6]. A few
reports have been dedicated to its use in accelerator facil-
ities, but most of them describe static Wien ﬁlters [7, 8].
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds of an RF Wien ﬁlter can
be used to manipulate the spins of particles in a storage
ring, and, as shown in [1, 2], open up the possibility for a
measurement of the EDMs of protons and deuterons.

The objective of the present publication is to describe
the design of a novel waveguide RF Wien ﬁlter for the
search for the EDMs of protons and deuterons at COSY [9,
10], pursued by the JEDI collaboration1. The fact that

proton and deuteron EDMs are expected to be very small
calls for precise design and manufacturing. We must ad-
mit that the spin-tracking tools required to provide spec-
iﬁcations for the design of the RF Wien ﬁlter have not
yet been fully developed. Recently, spin-tracking studies
with an ideal RF Wien ﬁlter were carried out [11, 12],
but these do not yet take into account a number of impor-
tant systematic eﬀects, such as fringe ﬁelds, unwanted ﬁeld
components, positioning errors, and non-vanishing Lorentz
forces. Therefore, an approach was adopted here to try to
realize the best possible device based on state-of-the-art
technologies.

A prototype RF Wien ﬁlter, based on an already ex-
isting RF dipole with radial magnetic ﬁeld [13, 14], was
recently developed and used at COSY. (The use of RF
dipoles and solenoids to manipulate stored polarized beams
is discussed in [15].) The RF dipole was equipped with
horizontal electric ﬁeld plates in order to provide an RF
Wien ﬁlter conﬁguration with vertical electric and horizon-
tal magnetic ﬁeld [16, 17]. The RF electromagnetic ﬁeld
was generated using two coupled resonators; one that gen-
erates the electric ﬁeld and another one that generates the
magnetic ﬁeld. The approach of using separate systems to
generate electric and magnetic ﬁelds, however, neglected
the inherent coupling between the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. Therefore, the approach described here, is based on
a novel waveguide system where by design the orthogonal-
ity between electric and magnetic ﬁelds is accomplished.

The paper is organized as follows:

• Section 2 describes the mechanical design of the RF
Wien ﬁlter. The parallel-plates waveguide and its
mechanical structure are described in Section 2.1,
the driving circuit in Section 2.2. The results of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld simulations, the Lorentz force
compensation, and the optimization of the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity by shaping the elec-
trodes is discussed in Section 2.3.

The system comprises a power source, a parallel plate
waveguide and a load. The plates are fed on their front
and rear sides by an RF current, which distributes on the
surfaces, thereby generating the required electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the enclosed space. Deviations from the ideal or-
thogonality and homogeneity of the ﬁelds are due to the
ﬁnite size of the plates and their limited conductivities.

The intended working frequencies of the RF Wien ﬁlter

• Section 3 describes the beam dynamics simulations.
A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out in order
to quantify the unwanted ﬁeld components of the RF
Wien ﬁlter with a realistic phase-space distribution
of the beam. A comparison of the prototype RF
Wien ﬁlter [16, 17] and the waveguide RF Wien ﬁlter
is given in Section 3.3.

• Section 4 presents results of thermal simulations based

on the power losses in the diﬀerent materials of the
device.

2. Design

2.1. Waveguide design

The RF Wien ﬁlter shall be operated at frequencies of
about 100 kHz to 2 MHz. The maximum acceptable length
for the vacuum vessel, given by space restrictions at COSY,
is 870 mm, which corresponds to approximately 1/300 of
the length of the electromagnetic wave (at 1 MHz). The
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode of a parallel-plate
waveguide fulﬁlls the requirement of orthogonal electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.

In order to maintain an overall vanishing Lorentz-force,
and to provide minimal unwanted ﬁeld components, it is
a priori not clear whether a small or a large beam size
is advantageous. Within the COSY ring, the PAX low-β
section [10] oﬀers the possibility to vary the beam size by
about a factor of three, therefore the RF Wien ﬁlter will
be installed at this location.

The design calculations for the waveguide RF Wien
ﬁlter were carried out using a full-wave simulation with
CST Microwave Studio2, and the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds were modeled with an accuracy of 10−6. Because of
the high expectations on ﬁeld homogeneity, an approach
was adopted that allows one to calculate the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds without additional assumptions, such as
quasi-static approximations or the like3.

fRF = frev|k + γG|, k ∈ Z

(1)

where k is the harmonic number, G the gyromagnetic
anomaly, γG the spin tune [18], and frev the revolution
frequency. With respect to the search for the EDMs of
deuterons and protons, experiments at a number of har-
monics shall be carried out for systematic reasons. Table 1
summarizes the resonance frequencies for deuterons at a
momentum of 970 MeV/c and for protons at 520 MeV/c,
for which electron-cooled beams with compensated cooler
solenoid are available at COSY. As indicated in Table 1
for deuterons (protons), ﬁve (four) harmonics are in the
operating frequency range of 100 kHz to 2 MHz.
In the
following, we restrict the discussion to deuterons at a mo-
mentum of 970 MeV/c.

The Lorentz force is given by

~FL = q(cid:16) ~E + ~v × ~B(cid:17) ,

(2)

where q is the charge of the particle, ~v = c(0, 0, β) is the
velocity vector, ~E = (Ex, Ey, Ez) and ~B = µ0(Hx, Hy, Hz)
denote the components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
and µ0 the vacuum permeability. For a vanishing Lorentz
force ~FL = 0, the required ﬁeld quotient Zq is determined,
which yields

Ex = −c · β · µ0 · Hy ,
Ex
Hy

= c · β · µ0 ≈ 173 Ω .

Figure 1 shows a cross section of the parallel-plates
waveguide RF Wien ﬁlter. The axis of the waveguide
points along the beam direction (z). The plates are sep-
arated by 100 mm along the x-direction. The width of
the plates is 182 mm. This setup ensures that during the
EDM studies, the main component of the electric ﬁeld (Ex)
points radially inwards in −x-direction, and the main com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld (Hy) upwards in y-direction
with respect to the stored beam. The system is placed
inside a cylindrical vacuum vessel. The electrodes are sur-
rounded by ferrite blocks made of CMD50056. The copper
electrodes are shaped in order to improve the homogene-
ity of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and to minimize the
Lorentz force, as explained in detail in Section 2.3.

rotation, with a precision of 0.01◦ (0.17 mrad); 6: ferrite cage; 7: CF160 rotatable ﬂange; 8: support structure of the
electrodes; 9: inner support tube. The axis of the waveguide points along the z-direction, the plates are separated along
x, and the plate width extends along y. During the EDM studies, the main ﬁeld component Ex points radially outwards
and Hy upwards with respect to the stored beam.

A sophisticated support structure, shown in Fig. 2, was
designed to ensure a high degree of rigidity, precision align-
ment and most importantly, low distortion of the gener-
ated electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electrodes are made from
double T-shaped copper plates for better stiﬀness and sta-
bility. They are mounted with 12 stainless-steel screws on
the main support structure of the electrodes. An inner
stainless-steel tube is used to hold, align and mount the
structure with high precision (≈ 10 µm).

The angular position of the RF Wien ﬁlter with respect
to the beam axis can be chosen to allow for a rotation
of the ﬁeld direction by 90◦ with an angular precision of
0.01◦ (0.175 mrad) using a belt drive (see label 5 in Fig. 1),
without breaking the vacuum. This feature is foreseen in
order to ﬁne tune the orientation of the RF Wien ﬁlter [12],
and also to exchange the role of electric and magnetic ﬁelds
during the EDM measurements for investigations of the
systematics.

The parallel-plates waveguide constitutes a transmis-
sion line structure, which has been analyzed in detail in [19].
For the waveguide to be used as a Wien ﬁlter, wave mis-

match must be introduced into the structure via a reﬂec-
tion, ensured by adding a resistor that controls the reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcient. Thereby, the characteristic ﬁeld quotient
Zq, given in Eq. (3), can be adjusted to the required value.
The multi-input feedthroughs ensure a homogeneous
current distribution over the electrodes, the two paral-
lel plates are connected to the ampliﬁer and the load via
four high-frequency, high-power CF 40 feedthroughs7. The
electrodes are connected to the feedthroughs via specially
designed connectors, and 3 dB power splitters are installed
to feed each plate at the edges.

The RF Wien ﬁlter comprises a cage of ferrite blocks
from CMD5005, which contains the electromagnetic ﬁelds
within the Wien ﬁlter and enhances the ﬁeld homogeneity.
CMD5005 is a NiZn-type high-permeability ferrite mate-
rial. Ref. [20] provides data of a dispersive model of the
complex permeability µr that have been used in the full-
wave simulator at frequencies from 100 kHz to 2 MHz. At

of the beam with respect to the axis of the RF Wien ﬁlter.

2.2. Driving circuit

Ideally, the driving circuit connects a load resistor di-
rectly to the electrodes, as shown in [19]. The ampli-
ﬁer (with 50 Ω internal impedance) is connected to the
Wien ﬁlter via a (1 : 0.5) Balun [23] which transforms
the impedance and converts the unbalanced output of the
ampliﬁer into a balanced one. A schematic of the driving
circuit is shown in Fig. 3. One of the main characteristics
of Balun transformers is their broadband response. The
return loss Lr of the driving circuit (Fig. 3), calculated
using CST Design Studio, is depicted in Fig. 4.

relative permittivity ǫr is around 25 [21]. CMD5005 ele-
ments come in blocks with a maximum length of 330 mm.
The ferrites are held together by clamps in a symmetric ar-
rangement. To make a connection between the electrodes
and the main support structure possible, 12 boreholes are
drilled in the ferrites. The screws supporting the elec-
trodes are insulated from the ferrites by ceramic cylindri-
cal insulators.

Another (1 : 1) Balun is used to connect the Wien
ﬁlter to the load resistor. Introducing the cables into the
schematic induces a phase shift between the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld, consequently, the ﬁeld quotient Zq, given in
Eq. (3), becomes complex. This eﬀect can be compensated
with an additional inductance Lp = 8 µH (as indicated in
Fig. 3), and an almost purely real-valued ﬁeld quotient is
obtained, i.e., Zq = 173 ∠0.1◦Ω.

2.3. Optimization of ﬁeld homogeneity

For minimal Lorentz forces, the electric and magnetic
forces must be matched at the center and the edges of the
RF Wien ﬁlter. As mentioned before, the ratio between
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds inside the RF Wien ﬁlter
can be controlled via the load resistor Rm, and the in-
ductance Lp (see Fig. 3). A special solution, however, is
required at the edges, where the slope of the curves of the
electric and magnetic forces are not the same. Accord-
ing to our simulations, a simple parallel-plates waveguide
deﬂects particles passing through the device in the same
directions at the exit and entry points. Under these cir-
cumstances, the overall Lorentz force cannot be zero when
the Lorentz force in the center is zero.

Our solution aims at a decomposition of the kicks at
each side of the RF Wien ﬁlter into two deﬂections of op-
posite sign in such a way that both deﬂections average
out. Decoupling the ﬁelds at the edges, keeping the elec-
tric ﬁeld unchanged while manipulating the magnetic ﬁeld,
is accomplished by retaining the plate separation (spac-
ing between the plates), while altering the width of the
plates [24]. In doing so, the slope of the curves of the elec-
tric ﬁeld remains constant while the magnetic ﬁeld crosses
the electric ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 5. This approach results
in trapezoid-shaped edges of the parallel plates, where the
ﬁeld crossing can now be optimized via the geometrical
properties of the trapezoid-shaped edges. After perform-
ing a series of simulations, an optimum trapezoid depth of
50 mm, with a short base of 50.5 mm and a long base of
100 mm was found, as shown in Fig. 2 (label 1).

Integrating and averaging the Lorentz force ~FL, given
in Eq. (2), along the axis of the RF Wien ﬁlter for the
geometry shown in Fig. 1 at an input power of 1 kW, yields

∆p/p = 10−4 translates into a variation of the required
ﬁeld quotient Zq of the same order of magnitude [see Eq. (3)],
and therefore, the resulting values for the Lorentz forces,
given in Eq. (4), are acceptable.

to its ability to manipulate the spins of the stored parti-
cles, and as a ﬁgure of merit, the ﬁeld integral of ~B along

Figure 6 shows the main (wanted) components of the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, Ex and By, in the xz plane.

In order to further increase the ﬁeld homogeneity, the
geometric parameters such as the width and the surface
shape of the copper electrodes, and also the geometric pa-
rameters of the ferrite blocks and their distance to the
metallic support structure, including the surrounding vacu-
um vessel were optimized. The simulations showed that
parabolically-shaped electrode surfaces instead of ﬂat ones
substantially improve the local homogeneity of the electric
ﬁeld along the RF Wien ﬁlter. The parameters of the op-
timized parabolic electrodes are indicated in Fig. 7, with a
major radius of 91 mm, and a minor radius of 6 mm, where
the sharp edges have been rounded using a 1 mm radius.
In the case of ﬂat electrodes, the electric ﬁeld varies up
to 8 V/m, and by parabolically shaping the electrodes, as
shown in Fig. 7, the electric ﬁeld variation does not exceed
0.1 V/m.

The advantage of using parabolic electrodes is illus-
trated in Fig. 8, where the relative variation of Ex and

parabolically-shaped electrodes show a better homogene-
ity along the beam trajectory.

The parabolically-shaped electrodes yield an improve-
ment of up to a factor of 20 in terms of local electric ﬁeld
homogeneity while reducing the local homogeneity of the

In total, the Lorentz

3. Beam dynamics simulations

3.1. Deﬁnition of unwanted ﬁeld components

The ﬁnite beam size induces non-ideal ﬁeld components
of ~E and ~H in undesired directions. The system is designed
such that unwanted ﬁeld components average out at the
exit and entry of the RF Wien ﬁlter. The unwanted ﬁeld
components are given by

~E⊥ = 


0
Ey
Ez


 , and ~H⊥ = 


Hx
0
Hz


 .

(7)

The index ⊥ is introduced to indicate that the unwanted
electric and magnetic ﬁeld components are perpendicular
to the main ﬁeld components Ex and Hy.

The particle beam that enters the RF Wien ﬁlter has a
deﬁned phase-space distribution [10], therefore the parti-
cles do not travel along straight lines, parallel to the beam
axis. In order to quantify the eﬀect of unwanted ﬁeld com-
ponents, a Monte-Carlo simulation based on solving the
relativistic equation of motion using the time- and space-
dependent ﬁelds has been carried out, with subsequent
integration of the ﬁeld components along the trajectories.
The electromagnetic simulation yields the complex ﬁelds
˜~E and
˜~H. The real ﬁelds ~E (~r, t) and ~H (~r, t) are obtained
from

~E (~r, t) = ℜ(cid:16) ˜~Eeiωt(cid:17) , and
~H (~r, t) = ℜ(cid:16) ˜~Heiωt(cid:17) .

were solved in Matlab8 using the ﬁeld maps imported from
the full-wave simulations. The mesh accuracy in the xy
plane amounts to 0.1 mm and 11 mm in z-direction. The
phase-space distribution of the beam at the entry of the
RF Wien ﬁlter is known [10]. The phase space is expressed
in terms of positions x and y, and transverse angles x′ =
vx/vz and y′ = vy/vz.

For each phase space, 5000 particles have been sim-
ulated with a 2σ beam emittance of εx,y = 1 µm. The
initial (x, x′) phase-space distributions are shown in red in
Fig. 9. The blue points represent the phase-space distri-
bution of the particles after passing through the RF Wien
ﬁlter. The (y, y′) distributions are not shown, but are very

similar. With low-β section ON and OFF, the areas of the
initial and ﬁnal ellipses are the same, and consistent with
the behavior of a ﬁeld free (drift) region. Thus the RF
Wien ﬁlter does not appear to alter the phase-space dis-
tributions of the beam.

Based on the simulations, the eﬀects of unwanted ﬁeld
components, given in Eq. (7), are quantiﬁed by integration
along the particle trajectories, and expressed as ratios with
respect to the total ﬁeld integrals, yielding

respectively, summarized in Table 3.

the beam size is small, and the angular variation is large.
As a consequence, the unwanted ﬁeld components E⊥ and
H⊥ do not completely cancel at the edges, leading to a
wider distribution. When the low-β section is OFF, the
beam size is large, but with small angular spread, leading
to a better cancellation of the unwanted ﬁeld components
at the edges.

E⊥ and f int

The distributions in Fig. 10 exhibit a line structure
that stems from the ﬁnite mesh (0.1 mm in the xy plane,
and 11 mm along z). Gaussian ﬁts to the projections of
the resulting distributions f int
H⊥ are shown in the
right panels of Fig. 10, the ﬁt results are summarized in
Table 3. For the low-β section either switched ON or OFF,
the mean values of the integrated unwanted electric and
magnetic ﬁeld components are zero within the errors. The
widths of the distributions, however, indicate that with
low-β section OFF, the unwanted electric and magnetic
ﬁeld components picked up by the beam are smaller by

about a factor of two to three compared to when the low-
β section is ON. These ﬁndings should be further investi-
gated using spin and particle tracking of a stored beam.
In addition, once the device is installed, the predictions
should be veriﬁed experimentally.

3.3. Comparison of prototype and waveguide RF Wien ﬁl-

ter

The waveguide RF Wien ﬁlter is compared to the pro-
totype RF Wien ﬁlter [16, 17] (see Section 1) in terms
of the unwanted ﬁeld components, evaluated according to
Eqs. (10) and (11), listed in Table 3. With the novel waveg-
uide RF Wien ﬁlter, unwanted electric and magnetic ﬁeld
components can be reduced by one to two orders of mag-
nitude.

Spin tracking simulation are required to quantify the
systematic errors induced by unwanted ﬁeld components,
and by other systematic eﬀects, e.g., positioning errors,

4. Thermal response of the RF Wien ﬁlter during

operation

Because of the thermal insulation by the vacuum, it
was investigated whether even small power losses could
lead to a temperature rise during operation. Therefore,
for the corresponding thermal simulations using the FEM
software ANSYS9 only radiative heat exchange between
the internal surfaces was considered. The entire power in
the copper plates was assumed to be generated at the loca-
tions of the feedthroughs. The calculated power loss densi-
ties with an input power of 1 kW were integrated over the
structural elements and are summarized in Table 4. The
temperature rise for the copper electrodes is 6 K, and 0.5 K
for the ferrites, respectively. Based on the temperature
distribution, the simulated thermal expansion of the cop-
per plates amounts to 48 µm, and to 8.6 µm for the ferrite
blocks. These values are small compared to the structure’s
dimensions, and we do not expect problems with respect
to the electromagnetic performance and the suspension of
the mechanical structure during operation of the RF Wien
ﬁlter.

5. Conclusion and Outlook

The paper presents the electromagnetic design calcu-
lations for a novel type of RF Wien ﬁlter that shall be
used at the COSY storage ring to determine the EDMs of
deuterons and protons. The main emphasis of the work

9ANSYS, Inc. Canonsburg, USA http://http://www.ansys.com

was to design a device that exhibits a high level of ho-
mogeneity of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The opti-
mization of the electromagnetic design was performed in
close cooperation with the mechanical design, taking into
account all the details of the mechanical construction.

A waveguide structure was selected because in this
case the orthogonality of E and B ﬁelds, required for a
Wien ﬁlter, can be ensured to a high level of precision.
Minimizing the overall Lorentz force, while still provid-
ing sizable electric and magnetic ﬁeld integrals, leads to
parabolically-shaped electrodes, equipped with trapezoid-
shaped entrance and exit partitions, surrounded by a closed
box of ferrites. Using the above described electrodes, the
overall Lorentz force is reduced by about a factor of ﬁve,
compared to ﬂat-shaped electrodes.

The RF Wien ﬁlter will be installed in a section at
COSY, where it is possible to vary the beam size by ad-
justing the β function between about β = 0.4 and 4 m.
Single-pass tracking calculations were performed in order
to quantify the eﬀect of unwanted electric and magnetic
ﬁeld components picked up by the beam, realistically dis-
tributed in phase space. The calculations indicate that
unwanted ﬁeld components picked up by the beam can be
reduced by about a factor of three when the RF Wien ﬁlter
is operated at β = 4 m.

Thermal simulations show that the heat load in the
diﬀerent materials of the device, when operated with an
input power of 1 kW is tolerable. Thus during operation,
the mechanical accuracy of the device does not appear to
substantially deteriorate the performance.

Forthcoming work will address improvements of the
driving circuit, which will allow us to reach larger ﬁeld
values with the same input power.
In addition, a novel
semi-analytical approach to assess quantitatively the ef-
fect of mechanical tolerances on the electromagnetic per-
formance of the RF Wien ﬁlter is presently being devel-
oped.
In addition, spin tracking studies are planned to
quantify the impact of the waveguide RF Wien ﬁlter on
the systematic error of the planned proton and deuteron
EDM experiments.
