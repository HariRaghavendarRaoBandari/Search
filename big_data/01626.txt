Abstract

We study spectral properties of convolution operators L and their perturbations
H = L + v(x) by compactly supported potentials. Results are applied to determine
the front propagation of a population density governed by operator H with a com-
pactly supported initial density provided that H has positive eigenvalues. If there
is no positive spectrum, then the stabilization of the population density is proved.

Key words: random walk, spectrum, front propagation, population, stabilization.

Introduction

In this paper we study the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian H in L2(Rd) given by

H = L + v(x), Lψ(x) = χZy∈Rd

(ψ(x + y) − ψ(x))a(y)dy,

x ∈ Rd,

(1)

(2)

where

a(y) = a(−y),

a ≥ 0,

ZRd

a(y)dy = 1,

and v(x) ≥ 0 is continuous and compactly supported.
The operator L is the generator of a symmetric random walk on Rd with the intensity
of jumps equal to χ > 0. Function a(y) is the density of transition from x to x + y at
the moment of the jump. Operators H of the form (1) appear in many applications,
such as models of population dynamics that include the KPP type processes (where the
oﬀspring start at the location of the parent particle [8], [4], [5], [6]) and contact processes

of the parent [9], [11]). Another area of application is the theory of phase transitions
for homopolymers, [2], [3]. The central object of investigation in both applications is the
solution u(t, x) of the parabolic problem

In the population dynamics models, u(t, x) is the ﬁrst correlation function, i.e., the
density of the population. The potential v(x) in these models is the diﬀerence between
the birth and death rates: v(x) = β(x) − µ(x). In the KPP type models, χ, β and µ are
independent, in the contact models, β = χ =const., µ ≤ β (see [11]). In the theory of
homopolymers, the solution of (3) is the partition function of the Gibbs distribution.

may exhibit two signiﬁcantly diﬀerent types of large time behavior. If operator H has a
positive eigenvalue λ0 (the largest eigenvalue has a positive eigenfunction, ground state,
φ0(x)), then the solution of the problem (4) grows exponentially in time on any ﬁxed
bounded domain D ⊂ Rd. This is a manifestation of an instability under local perturba-
tion (by the potential v). If the spectrum of H belongs to (−∞, 0], then in many cases
the density u(t, x) remains bounded as t → ∞, and one can expect the existence of a
steady state for the perturbed problem.
The fundamental diﬀerence between the classical Schr¨odinger operator and the Hamil-
tonian H under consideration is that the potential term in the Schr¨odinger operator is
a relatively compact perturbation of the Laplacian, but now this term is not relatively
compact with respect to the operator L. In order to overcome this diﬃculty, an essential
restriction on v will be imposed: in majority of cases we will assume that 0 ≤ v(x) < χ. In
the context of population models, this condition precludes the scenario where the growth
of the population in a single point overwhelms the ability of the population to spread. It
automatically holds in the case of the contact models.

The problem of the existence of a ground state energy λ0(v) > 0 was discussed in
the recent paper [10]. The central idea of the approach in [10] is similar to ideas used in
[2], [3], but the setting is diﬀerent. Let us stress that the results in the paper [10] were
based solely on the Perron-Frobenius theory. Here we impose additionally the symmetry
condition a(y) = a(−y) that leads to the self-adjointness of L and allows us to provide a
detailed spectral analysis of L or H.

In this paper we will study:
a) The a.c. spectrum of L and H. Conditions for the spectrum to be pure a.c..
b) Examples of operators L with the point spectrum imbedded into the a.c. one.

2

c) The discrete spectrum outside of the a.c. one;

in particular, the diﬀerence in
the properties of this spectrum for operators H with recurrent and transient underlying
random walks (an analogue of the properties that hold for the standard Schr¨odinger
operators).

d) The asymptotic behavior at inﬁnity of the ground state φ0(x).
e) The propagation of the population front when the ground state exists and conver-
gence of the solution of (4) to a bounded solution as t → ∞ in the case of absence of
positive spectrum.
Certain results for operator H on the lattice Z d (where the situation is similar and

simpler) can be found in [12], [13], [14].

2 Spectral analysis of operator L
After the Fourier transform, operator L becomes the operator of multiplication by function
χ(ba(k) − 1), whereba =ba(k) is given by
e−i(k,y)a(y)dy =ZRd
From (2) it follows that functionba is real-valued and
|ba(k)| < 1, k 6= 0;
We will assume that functionba satisﬁes the following condition:
ba ∈ L1(Rd),
Consider a more general operator than bL. Let B : L2(Rd) → L2(Rd) be an operator of

multiplication by a smooth real-valued function β = β(k), i.e., Bφ(k) = β(k)φ(k). Denote
the λ-level set of the function β by βλ, i.e.,

ba(k) =ZRd
ba(0) = 1;

which is natural to guarantee the continuity of the jump distribution density a(y).

(5)

(7)

cos(k, y)a(y)dy.

ba(k) → 0 as k → ∞.

If S is a set in Rd, then its Lebesgue measure will be denoted by m(S) (notation µ is
preserved for the spectral measure of operator B).

βλ = {k ∈ Rd : β(k) = λ}.

(8)

Lemma 2.1. Operator B has the following properties.

(1) The spectrum of B coincides with the range of function β.
(2) The point spectrum of B consists of points λ for which m(βλ) > 0. All the eigen-

values have inﬁnite multiplicity.

(3) If for some interval ∆ ⊂ SpB,

m(S∆) = 0 where S∆ = {k ∈ Rd : β(k) ∈ ∆,∇β(k) = 0},

(9)

then SpB is absolutely continuous on ∆.

4) If β is analytic and not constat, then the spectrum of B is absolutely continuous.

Proof.1 The ﬁrst statement is obvious. The second one is also trivial. Indeed, each
function with the support in the set βλ is an eigenfunction of B with the eigenvalue λ.
Conversely, if (β(k) − λ)f (k) = 0, then f (k) = 0 for k /∈ βλ, and therefore f = 0 as an
element of L2(Rd) if m(βλ) = 0. Let us prove the third statement. One needs only to
show that the spectral measure µf of an arbitrary element f ∈ L2(Rd) does not have a
singular continuous component in ∆.
Let Pδ be the spectral projection of operator B on an arbitrary interval δ ⊂ ∆. Then
µf (δ) =< Pδf, f >. Since ∆ does not contain eigenvalues, by the Stone formula, the
following relation holds for each smooth compactly supported f :

Pδf (k) = lim
ε→+0

πZδ

εf (k)dλ

(β(k) − λ)2 + ε2 = χδ(k)f (k),

where χδ is the characteristic function of the set {k : β(k) ∈ δ}. Thus the same relation
is valid for arbitrary f ∈ L2(Rd). Hence

µf (δ) =ZRd

χδ(k)|f (k)|2dk,

and therefore, for each set γ ⊂ ∆,

µf (γ) =ZRd

χγ(k)|f (k)|2dk, χγ(k) = 1 if β(k) ∈ γ, χγ(k) = 0 if β(k) /∈ γ.

It remains to show that µf (γ) = 0 if m(γ) = 0.

Assume that there exists a set γ of Lebesgue measure zero such that

µf (γ) =ZRd

χγ(k)|f (k)|2dk = ε > 0.

Using an approximation of f in L2(Rd) by bounded functions with compact supports, one
can ﬁnd r < ∞ and ε1 > 0 such that

Z|k|<r

χγ(k)dk ≥ ε1 > 0.

(10)

We split the support of χγ in the ball |k| < r into two parts: b1(σ) is the set where
|∇β(k)| ≥ σ > 0 and b2(σ) is the set where |∇β(k)| < σ. Obviously m(b1(σ)) = 0 and
m(b2(σ)) → 0 as σ → 0. Thus the support of χγ in the ball |k| < r has Lebesgue measure
zero. This contradicts (10) and completes the proof of the third statement of the lemma.
The last statement follows from the previous one and the Weierstrass preparation
theorem. Indeed, let ∇β(k0) = 0. We choose i such that ∂β
does not vanish identically
in a neighborhood of k = k0. Then there is a neighborhood of k = k0 where the equation

respect to remaining variables k′ ∈ Rd−1. For each ﬁxed value of k′, the polynomial W (k)
has N roots in ki. Thus the set of roots has zero measure in Rd. This implies (9) and
allows one to apply the statement 3 of the lemma.

The following three classes of densities a(y) will be considered.

1. Processes with light tails for which |a(y)| < Ce−δ|y|, and therefore ba = ba(k) is

analytic in k when |Imk| < δ with some δ > 0.

2. Moderate tails are deﬁned by the condition

3. Processes with heavy tails are deﬁned by (11) with γ ∈ (0, 2). Thus the second

expansion is valid instead of (11).

Relations (6) imply that the range of the function χ(ba(k) − 1) is [−a, 0], where χ ≤

a ≤ 2χ.
Theorem 2.2. The spectrum of operator L coincides with the segment [−a, 0]. The
spectrum of L is pure a.c. in the case of light tails. It is a.c. in a neighborhood of the
origin in the case of moderate tails. It may contain a countable set of embedded eigenvalues
of inﬁnite multiplicity in the case of moderate and heavy tails.

spectrum is a.c.

and therefore, a(y) is analytic and decays at inﬁnity faster than any power.

Proof. The ﬁrst two statements are proved in Lemma 2.1. Let us prove that the
in a neighborhood of the origin in the case of moderate tails. Note

Remark An example with embedded eigenvalues will be constructed whenba ∈ C ∞
that ba ∈ C 2. Since ba(0) = 1 and ∇ba(0) = 0 (due to the symmetry of a(y)), we have
ba(k) = 1 − 1
Therefore ∇ba(k) = −Bk + o(|k|), k → 0, and functionba does not have critical points in

for some k0 6= 0. The latter implies cos(k0, y) = 1 on an open set where a(y) > 0. This

contradicts the analyticity of cos(k0, y). Sinceba(k) < 1 for k 6= 0 andba(k) → 0 as k → ∞,
there exists ε > 0 such thatba(k) < 1 − ε when |k| > δ. Thus item (3) of Lemma 2.1 can

be applied to the interval ∆ = (−χε, 0), i.e., the spectral measure is a.c. there.
In order to complete the proof of the theorem, we need to construct an example of an
operator with embedded eigenvalues. First we will construct a one-dimensional operator

with at least one eigenvalue of inﬁnite multiplicity. Consider the functionba =ba(|k|), k ∈

R1, whose graph is given in Fig 1. We will make it smoother later. The inverse Fourier
transform gives

a(x) =

1
πx2 [(1 − cos x)(1 − h) + (cos 2x − cos 3x)h].

If we put s = sin2 x/2 here, then we will obtain that

πx2a(x) = 2(1 − h)s + 2hs(5 − 20s + 16s2) = 2s(1 + 4h − 20hs + 16hs2).

For each h > 0, the quadratic polynomial in s in the right hand side has the minimum at
s = 5/8, and the minimum value equals 1 − 9h/4. We choose h ≤ 4/9. This implies that

a(x) is a density (i.e., a(x) ≥ 0, R a(x)dx =ba(0) = 1).
After the Fourier transform, operator L acts as multiplication by χ[ba(|k|)−1]. Thus, L

has a continuous spectrum [−χ, 0] and two embedded eigenvalues λ0 = χ(h−1), λ1 = −χ.
Each L2-function supported on [1, 2] ([3,∞)) is a Fourier representation of an eigenfunc-
tion of L with the eigenvalue λ0 (λ1, respectively.)
In order to obtain an operator with inﬁnitely many embedded eigenvalues, consider
the function (we will show below that it is a density)

(14)

i.e., h0 is large enough and hj decay fast enough. From (14) it follows that a(x) can be
extended by continuity at x = 0 and that series (13) with complex x converges uniformly
on any bounded region of the complex plane. Hence, a(x) is an entire function.

a(x) =

Let us rewrite (13) in the form

j=m hj on the intervals
[2m − 1, 2m], m ≥ 1, and the straight line segments with the slope −hm on the intervals
[2m, 2m + 1], m ≥ 0. The heights of the latter segments are chosen by the continuity

The Fourier image ba = ba(|k|) of a(x) resembles the function on Fig 1. It is a con-
tinuous piece-wise linear function with constant values cm = P∞
condition. Note thatba(0) = c0 =P hj = 1.

The ratio of the sine functions on the right does not exceed 4j + 1. Thus (14) implies

∞Xj=1
that a(x) ≥ 0. SinceR a(x)dx =ba(0) = 1, function a(x) is a density.
Since the Fourier image ba = ba(|k|) of a(x) has a constant value cm on the interval

[2m − 1, 2m], it follows that λm = χcm, m ≥ 1, are eigenvalues of L of inﬁnite multiplic-
ity. The corresponding eigenspaces contain all L2-functions whose Fourier transforms are
supported on [2m − 1, 2m].

The constructed density a(x) satisﬁes all the requirements of the theorem except the

negative function with the support on |k| ≤ δ < 1/5. We choose c from the condition

smoothness of its Fourier transformba(k). In order to satisfy the latter requirement, we
replace a(x) by a(1)(x) = cβ2(x)a(x) where the Fourier transform bβ(k) of β is a non-
R a(1)(x)dx = 1. Then, obviously, a(1)(x) is a density, is an entire function, and its Fourier
transformda(1)(k) = cbβ(k)∗bβ(k)∗ba(k) is inﬁnitely smooth. Since the support of cbβ(k)∗bβ(k)
belongs to the interval |k| ≤ 2δ < 2/5, functionda(1)(k) has constant values bm = bcm on

intervals lm = [2m − 1 + 2δ, 2m − 2δ], m ≥ 1. Here |lm| ≥ 1/5 and

b = cZRbβ(k) ∗bβ(k)dk = c(ZRbβ(k))2 > 0.

Hence λm = χbcm, m ≥ 1, are eigenvalues of L of inﬁnite multiplicity, and the correspond-
ing eigenspaces contain all the L2-functions whose Fourier transforms are supported on
lm.

The transition from d = 1 to arbitrary d > 1 is simple. If x = (x1, ..., xd), then one

can take a(x) =Qi a(1)(xi).

We will assume (without loss of generality) that the coeﬃcient χ in the deﬁnition of
L is equal to one. One can reduce the problem to this case by simple rescaling t →
χt, v(x) → χv(x).

Using the Fourier transform, we obtain that

Condition (2) implies that the range of the function ba(k) − 1 is a segment [−α, 0],

where 1 ≤ α ≤ 2. When λ ∈ C\[−α, 0], the Green function Gλ(x− y) (the integral kernel
of the negative resolvent Gλ := −(L − λ)−1) has the form

(using (6), (7)) show that the process x(t) is transient if and only if

It was shown in the proof of Theorem 2.2 thatba(k) < 1 when k 6= 0. Thus the validity
of (20) depends only on behavior ofba(k)− 1 near the origin. It follows from (12) that the
case of heavy tails, then (see [1])ba(k) − 1 ∼ |k|γ as k → 0, and therefore the processes

processes x(t) in the cases of light and moderate tails are recurrent in dimensions d = 1, 2
and are transient if d ≥ 3. If a slightly stronger version of expansion (11) is valid in the
with heavy tails are recurrent when d = 1, γ ≥ 1, and are transient in all the other cases.

The following lemma will be needed for the spectral analysis of operator H.

Lemma 3.1. Functions p(t, x) − e−tδ(x) for t > 0, Tλ(x) for λ > 0, and T0(x) when the
process x(t) is transient are strictly positive.

Proof. From (7) it follows that function a(x) is uniformly continuous and bounded:

|a(x)| ≤ A := 1

(2π)dRRd |ba(k)|dk. Put

an(x) = (a ∗ a ∗ ... ∗ a)(x),

(22)

where there are exactly n factors on the right. Using the last relation in (2), one can
easily justify by induction that all the functions an(x) are continuous and bounded by the
same constant A. The latter is useful to justify the convergence of the series (23) below.

Due to the symmetry of a(x), we have

a2(0) =ZRd

a(y)a(−y)dy =ZRd

a2(y)dy > 0.

Thus there exists δ > 0 such that a2(x) > 0 when |x| < δ. Since a(x) ≥ 0, from the
deﬁnition of the convolution it follows that an(x) ≥ 0 for all n, x, and a2n(x) > 0 when
|x| < nδ. The latter two facts together with (18) immediately imply that

p(t, x) − e−tδ(x) = e−t

an(x) > 0 t > 0.

The positivity of the ﬁrst function in the statement of the lemma is proved. The

positivity of the second one could be proved similarly. Another option is to note that

The formula above follows from (17), (18) and the uniform boundedness of p(t, x)−e−tδ(x),
which is one of the consequences of (23). The positivity of the integrand in (24) implies
that Tλ(x) > 0 when λ > 0. Moreover, the right-hand side in (24) increases monotonically
when λ → +0. Hence, if the limiting function T0(x) exists, it is also positive.

4 Spectral analysis of operator H

We will continue to assume that χ = 1.

the ﬁrst term becames an operator of multiplication by functionba(k) decaying at inﬁnity

Operator H = L + v(x) is a sum of a convolution operator and an operator of multipli-
cation by a compactly supported potential. There is a duality between these two terms.
If H is rewritten in the form H = (L + 1) + (v(x) − 1), then after the Fourier transform,
(see (6)) and the second term becomes a convolution operator. If v is smooth, then the
spectrum of the second term is given by Lemma 2.1, and it coincides with the segment
[−1, max v(x) − 1]. These arguments lead to the following statement.
Theorem 4.1. Let the potential v be continuous. Then the essential spectrum of operator
H contains segments [−a, 0] and [−1, max v(x) − 1].

Proof. Let λ0 ∈ [−1, max v(x) − 1] and v(x0) − 1 = λ0. Let

ψε(x) = (πε)−d/4e− |x−x0|2

2ε

.

Then kψε(x)kL2 = 1 and k(v(x) − 1)ψε(x)kL2 → 0 as ε → 0. Moreover,

|bψε(k)| = (4πε)d/4e− ε|k|2

2

.

Hence kbabψεkL2 → 0 as ε → 0 due to the decay ofba(k) at inﬁnity, i.e.,

k(L + 1)ψε(x)kL2 → 0 as

ε → 0.

Thus ψε(x) is a Weyl sequence, and therefore λ0 belongs to the essential spectrum of H.
The segment [−a, 0] is treated similarly due to the duality discussed above.

We would like to consider operators where the potential can produce only discrete
spectrum on positive semiaxis. Thus we will assume that v(x) ≤ 1, and often that
v(x) < 1. As it was mentioned in the introduction, this restriction appears naturally in
contact models. On the other hand, we would like to introduce a sequence of potentials
vR(x) whose action becomes stronger as R → ∞. Thus we will consider vR(x) = v(x/R).
We do not need for the potential to be smooth. It can be only measurable (and bounded),
but in some cases we assume that it has a positive limiting value at the origin or is
continuous.

Theorem 4.2. Let the potential v be continuous, 0 ≤ v(x) ≤ 1 − δ with some δ > 0, and
(1) The spectrum of the operator H = L + v(x/R) on the positive semi-axis consists of
at most a countable set of eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity with the only possible limiting
point at λ = 0. These eigenvalues are located on the interval (0, 1 − δ].

when R is small enough. If, additionally, v(0) > 0, then positive eigenvalues exist for
large enough R.

(4) In all the cases, the largest positive eigenvalue (if positive eigenvalues exist) is
simple and the corresponding eigenfunction is positive. Function λ0(R) is a monotone
function of R if v(x) depends monotonically on |x|.

Proof. Formula ψ = √vRu establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the
eigenfunctions u of H with positive eigenvalues λ = λi > 0 and the solutions of the
problem

λ > 0.

(25)

We put here Gλ = 1

(I − √vRGλ√vR)ψ = 0, ψ ∈ L2
1+λI + Tλ and arrive at

or, equivalently,

(I − √wTλ√w)ψ1 = 0, w =

(1 + λ)vR

1 + λ − vR ≥ 0, ψ1 = √wu ∈ L2(D),

(26)

where D is the support of w(x).

We will consider √wTλ√w as an operator in L2(D). Since the symbol

(1+λ−ba(k))(1+λ)
of Tλ is integrable, its inverse Fourier transform is bounded and the integral kernel of
the operator √wTλ√w is bounded and compactly supported. Thus operator √wTλ√w
is compact (this is the reason to consider (26) instead of (25)). Obviously, √wTλ√w
depends analytically on λ when λ > 0, and

ba(k)

kTλkL2 → 0 as λ → ∞.

(27)

Thus the operator in the left-hand side of (26) is invertible when λ ≫ 1. The analytic
Fredholm theorem implies the validity of the ﬁrst statement of the theorem except the
assertion that the eigenvalues belong to (0, 1 − δ]. The latter follows from the fact that
L ≤ 0 (and therefore H ≤ sup v(x)).
For a more detailed analysis of the set {λi}, consider the eigenvalues {µj(λ, R)}, λ >
0, R > 0, of the operator √wTλ√w. Since Tλ(x−y) is strictly positive (due to Lemma 3.1),
the Perron-Frobenius theorem implies that, for each λ, R > 0, the operator √wTλ√w has

11

the largest positive simple eigenvalue µ0 (the ground energy) with a positive eigenfunction
(the ground state), and |µj| < µ0, j > 0. Obviously, µj(λ, R) → +0 as j → ∞. Equation
(26) implies that the eigenvalues λi > 0 of H are deﬁned by the equations

From (23) and (24) it follows that

µj(λ, R) = 1, j ≥ 0.

(28)

Tλ(x) =

an(x)

(1 + λ)n+1

∞Xn=1

is a strictly decaying function of λ when λ > 0. From (26) it follows that w = 1+ vR
is
a strictly decaying function of λ when vR 6= 0 and that w → v(0) monotonically as R → ∞
if v(x) is monotone in |x|. The positivity of the integral kernel of operator √wTλ√w and
the positivity of the ground state together with the monotonicity properties discussed
above imply that the ground state

1+λ−vR

µ0(λ, R) = min

ψ:kψk=1

(√wTλ√wψ, ψ)

is a strictly decaying function of λ, λ > 0, and that it is increases with R if v(x) is
monotone in |x|.
Recall that µ0(λ, R) → 0 as λ → ∞ (due to (27)). The monotonicity of µ0(λ, R) in
λ implies the existence of the limit µ0(+0, R) = limλ→+0 µ0(λ, R). From (28) it follows
that H has positive eigenvalues if and only if µ0(+0, R) > 1, and the largest eigenvalue
λ0(R) > 0 of H is deﬁned by the equation

µ0(λ, R) = 1.

(29)

Hence from the Perron-Frobeneus theorem and the monotonicity of µ0 it follows that
the eigenvalue λ0(R) > 0 is simple and monotone in R when v(x) is monotone in |x|.
Moreover, the eigenfunction u of H with the eigenvalue λ0(R) satisﬁes the equation (L −
λ0 + vR)u = 0, and ψ1 = √wu is the the ground state for √wTλ√w. Thus u = Gλψ1 > 0
since ψ1 ≥ 0 and since the integral kernel of operator Gλ = 1
1+λ + Tλ is strictly positive
due to Lemma 3.1. This completes the proof of the last statement of the theorem. It
remains to prove statements two and three. Prior to starting the proofs, let us note that
the Perron-Frobeneus theorem implies that µ0(λ, R) = k√wTλ√wk. In particular, H has

positive eigenvalues if and only if

λ→+0k√wTλ√wk > 1.

lim

(30)

Assume that the process x(t) is recurrent. Then (21) implies that k√wTλ√wk → ∞

as λ → 0. This proves the second statement of the theorem.
Let the underlying random process be transient, i.e., (20) holds. The latter relation
implies that the integral kernel Tλ(x − y) of the operator Tλ is continuous and converges

12

uniformly in x, y to a continuous function T0(x − y) as λ → +0. Then the operators
√wTλ√w converge in the operator norm to the integral operator Q with the kernel

s vR(x)

1 − vR(x)

T0(x − y)s vR(y)

1 − vR(y)

, T0(x − y) =

(2π)dZRdba(k)eik(x−y)
1 −ba(k)

dk ∈ C.

Due to (46), H has positive eigenvalues if and only if kQk > 1.

Since function |T0(x)| is bounded due to (20), the integral kernel Q(x, y) of operator

Q has the estimate |Q(x, y)| <q vR(x)
kQk2 ≤Z |Q(x, y)|2dxdy ≤ C(Z

dx)2 → 0 as R → 0.

Thus H does not have positive eigenvalues when R is small enough.

In order to prove that the eigenvalues exist when R is large enough, we need to show
that kQk > 1 for R ≫ 1. Consider ψε(x) = εd/4π−d/4e−ε|x|2/2. Then kψεk = 1 and
bψε(k) = (επ)−d/4e−|x|2/2ε. Obviously, bψ2
(T0ψε, ψε) = (2π)−dZRd

ε (k)dk → ∞ as ε → +0

ε → δ(k) as ε → +0 and

sinceba(0) = 1. We assume that v(0) > 0 and choose ε = ε0 > 0 such that the left-hand

side above exceeds 2v−2(0) when 0 < ε ≤ ε0. We have

ba(k)
1 −ba(k)bψ2
(Qψε0, ψε0) = (2π)−dZRd
ba(k)
1 −ba(k)|dvRψε0|2(k)dk,

where dvRψε0 is the Fourier transform of v(x/R)ψε0(x). The latter product converges to
v(0)ψε0(x) in L1 as R → ∞, and therefore \vRψε0 → v(0)cψε0 uniformly as R → ∞. Hence

(20) implies that

(Qψε0, ψε0) → v2(0)(T0ψε0, ψε0) > 2 as R → ∞.

This proves the existence of the eigenvalues when R ≫ 1.

5 Asymptotics of the Green function at inﬁnity

We will obtain here the asymptotics of the Green function Gλ(x), λ > 0, |x| → ∞, for
processes with ultra light tails, i.e., under the assumption that

a(x) ≤ Ce−|x|α

, α > 1.

13

(31)

We will also assume that the same estimate is valid for the gradient of a(x):

From (16), (17) it follows that Gλ(x), λ > 0, can be rewritten in the form (compare

|∇a(x)| ≤ Ce−|x|α

.

(32)

to (23))

Gλ(x) =

δ(x)
1 + λ

+

∞Xn=1

an(x)

(1 + λ)n+1 ,

(33)

where an is the convolution of n copies of a(x), see (22). The asymptotics of Gλ at inﬁnity
will be expressed in terms of the moment generating function

Ee(ν,y) :=ZRd

e(ν,y)a(y)dy.

(34)

From (31) it follows that the function (34) is analytic in ν and positive when ν ∈ Rd.
Thus it can be rewritten as

ZRd

e(ν,y)a(y)dy = eH(ν),

ν ∈ Rd,

where H(ν), ν ∈ Rd, is analytic and real-valued.
Lemma 5.1. Function H(ν) has the following properties: H(0) = 0, H(ν) is even
(H(ν) = H(−ν)), and it is strictly convex with

B(ν) := HessH(ν) = [

∂2H(ν)
∂νi∂νj

] > 0.

Corollary. The map ν → ∇H(ν) is a diﬀeomorphism of Rd, i.e., the equation

∇H(ν) = p ∈ Rd

(35)

(36)

has the unique solution ν = ν∗(p), which is an analytic function of p ∈ Rd.
the symmetry of a. Let us show (35). Consider the density

Proof. Relation (2) implies that H(0) = 0. The symmetry of H is a consequence of

aν(y) = e−H(ν)a(y)e(ν,y),

ν ∈ Rd.

Obviously, aν(y) ≥ 0 andRRd aν(y)dy = 1, i.e., aν(y) is a density. Since

we have

ZRd

aν(y)e(k,y)dy = eH(ν+k)−H(ν),

ZRd
yaν(y)dy = ∇k[eH(ν+k)−H(ν)]k=0 = ∇H(ν).

(37)

(38)

Similarly,

ZRd

[yiyj]aν(y)dy = [

∂H(ν)

∂H(ν)

∂νi

∂νj

] + [

∂2H(ν)
∂νi∂νj

].

The last two relations imply that B(ν) is the covariance of the process with the density
aν(y), and therefore B(ν) > 0.

Denote by H ∗(p) the Legendre transform of the function H(ν), i.e.,

H ∗(p) = max

ν

[pν − H(ν)] = H(ν∗(p)),

where ν = ν∗(p) is the solution of (36).

Consider the ”phase” function

S = S(τ, θ, λ) = τ [H ∗(

θ
τ

) + ln(1 + λ)],

0 < τ < ∞,

where θ = x
origin, it follows that

|x|, ε ≤ λ ≤ 1/ε. Since H ∗ is convex and has zero of the second order at the

lim
τ →0

S = lim
τ →∞

S = ∞.

Hence S achieves its absolute minimum value. This value is positive since S is strictly
positive. Note also that

Sτ τ =

1
τ

< HessH ∗(p)p, p >,

p =

θ
τ

,

and therefore Sτ τ > 0. Thus for each θ and λ, there is a unique positive point τ = τ 0(θ, λ)
where S has the absolute minimum value, and this point depends smoothly on θ and λ.
Let

ϕ = ϕ(θ, λ) := S|τ =τ 0(θ,λ) > 0.

(39)

Theorem 5.2. There exists a smooth function f = f (θ, λ) > 0 such that for each λ′ > 0,

Gλ(x) = f (θ, λ)|x|(1−d)/2e−|x|ϕ(θ,λ)(1 + o(1)),

0 < λ′ ≤ λ ≤ 1/λ′,

|x| → ∞,

(40)

where ϕ is deﬁned in (39).

In order to prove the theorem, we will need the following two lemmas.

Lemma 5.3. The following asymptotics holds uniformly in y when |y|

n ≤ b < ∞:

an(y) =

e−nH ∗( y
n )

(2πn)d/2pdet B(ν∗( y

n))

15

(1 + o(1)), n → ∞.

(41)

Proof. Consider the sum Sn,ν = X1,ν + ... + Xn,ν of i.i.d.r.v. with the density aν(y)

(see (37)). Due to the CLT,

Sn,ν − EX1,ν

√n

law
−→ N(0, B(ν)), n → ∞.

In fact we need the asymptotics of the density an,ν(y) of the sum Sn,ν. Due to the local
CLT [7],

an,ν(nEX1,ν) =

(1 + o(1)), n → ∞,

uniformly in ν in every ball |ν| ≤ β < ∞. The local limit theorem for densities holds
under the condition that

for some m > 0. This condition holds in our case due to (31), (32). We combine the local
limit theorem for an,ν(nEX1,ν) with (38) and obtain

1

(2πn)d/2pdet B(ν)
|baν|m ∈ L1(Rd)
(2πn)d/2pdet B(ν)

1 + o(1)

an,ν(n∇H(ν)) =

,

|ν| ≤ β, n → ∞.

Function an,ν is the convolution of n copies of (37), and therefore

an,ν(y) = e−nH(ν)an(y)e(ν,y).

Thus,

an(n∇H(ν)) = enH(ν)−(ν,y)an,ν(n∇H(ν)) =

where |ν| ≤ β, n → ∞. It remains only to choose ν = ν∗( y
n ).

Lemma 5.4. There exists a constant c such that

|an(y)| ≤ en(c− 1

2 ( |y|

n )α) when |y|

n ≥ 1.

enH(ν)−(ν,y)

(2πn)d/2pdet B(ν)

(1 + o(1)),

(42)

Remark. This estimate shows that an(y) decays at inﬁnity somewhat slower, but

similarly to a(y) (see (31)). The estimate will be used when |y|

n is large enough.

Proof. We write a(y) in the form a(y) = e− 1

2 |y|αb(y), Then b ∈ L1 due to (31).
Consider the integrand in the convolution of n copies of a(y). We combine together all
the exponents and all the factors with function b. Then we estimate the product of the
exponents by its maximum value. This implies that

|an(y)| ≤ (max e− L

2 )|bn(y)|, L = |y − y(1)|α + |y(1) − y(2)|α + ... + |y(n−1)|α,

16

where bn is the convolution of n copies of the function b. It is obvious that L has the
minimum value when all its terms are equal, i.e., L ≥ n( |y|
n )α. It remains to note that
|bn(y)| ≤ C n = enc, where C = kbkL1, c = ln C.

Proof of Theorem 5.2. We represent Gλ(x), x 6= 0, as the sum Gλ(x) = G1 + G2 +
G3, x 6= 0, where G1 contains terms from the right-hand side of (33) with small values
of n, G2 contains terms with large values of n, and G3 contains terms with intermediate
values of n. We do not need to worry about the delta-function in the right-hand side of
(33) since we assume that x 6= 0. To be more exact, the splitting of Gλ(x) depends on
the values of x and λ, and is deﬁned as follows.
Let s ≥ 1 be an arbitrary number such that

1
2

tα − 2ϕt − c + ln(1 + λ) > 0 for

t ≥ s,

(43)

where ϕ = ϕ(θ, λ) and c > 0 are deﬁned in (39) and Lemma 5.4, respectively. Function G1
is the sum of terms from (33) with n such that |x|
n ≥ s. Function G2 consists of terms with
|x|
n ≤ s1, where s1 is an arbitrary number from the interval (0, ln(1+λ)
). The inequalities
s1 < |x|
n < s hold for the terms in G3. Let us show that G1 and G2 do not contribute to
the asymptotics of Gλ(x).

ϕ

Since s ≥ 1, from Lemma 5.4 and (43) it follows that

G1 ≤ C Xn≤|x|/s

en[c− 1

2 ( |x|

n )α−ln(1+λ)] ≤ C Xn≤|x|/s

e−n(2ϕ |x|

n ) = C Xn≤|x|/s

e−2ϕ|x| ≤ C1|x|e−2ϕ|x|.

This term is exponentially smaller than the right-hand side in (40).

Lemmas 5.3 and 5.1 imply that an(x) are uniformly bounded when |x|

n ≤ s1. Hence

G2 ≤ C Xn≥|x|/s1

e−n ln(1+λ) ≤ C1e−|x| ln(1+λ)/s1 ≤ C1e−|x|(ϕ+γ),

where γ > 0 since s1 < ln(1+λ)
side in (40).

ϕ

. Hence G2 is also exponentially smaller than the right-hand

Let us evaluate G3 now. We have

G3 = Xn: s1< |x|

n <s

(1 + λ)n+1 = Xn: s1< |x|

n <s

n−d/2g(

where g( x
the form

n) = C[det B(ν∗( x

x and rewrite the last formula in

G3 = Xn: 1/s<τn<1/s1

|x|−d/2h(τn)e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ)(1 + o(1)),

17

where h(τ ) := τ −d/2g( 1
τ ) is inﬁnitely smooth on the segment [1/s, 1/s1]. Since n > |x|/s
here, the remainder terms o(1) in the formula above vanish uniformly in n when |x| → ∞
(see Lemma 5.3). Besides, all the terms in the right-hand side are positive. Hence, it is
enough to prove the statement of the theorem for

u := Xn: 1/s<τn<1/s1

|x|−d/2h(τn)e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ).

(44)

Recall that S has the absolute minimum value ϕ(θ, λ) when τ = τ (0). We ﬁx an
arbitrary ε > 0 and choose a δ > 0 such that |Sτ| < ε when |τ − τ (0)| ≤ δ. Since
S(τ, θ, λ) − ϕ(θ, λ) > γ1 > 0 when |τ − τ (0)| ≥ δ and the number of terms in (44) has
order O(|x|), formula (44) can be rewritten as follows

|x|−d/2h(τn)e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ) + O(e−|x|[ϕ(θ,λ)+γ1]).

(45)

u = Xn: |τn−τ (0)|<δ

In order to obtain the asymptotics of u, we will show that function (45) is close to the
integral

I = |x|(2−d)/2Z|τ −τ (0)|<δ

h(τ )e−|x|S(τ,θ,λ)dτ

when |x| → ∞. Then we will apply the Laplace method to get the asymptotics of I as
|x| → ∞.
Let ln = [τn, τn+1], and let l be the union of ln for all n such that |τn − τ (0)| < δ. Since
the interval [τ (0) − δ, τ (0) + δ] of integration in I diﬀers from l by two small intervals near
points τ (0) ± δ, and S − ϕ > γ2 > 0 there, we have

I = |x|(2−d)/2Zl

h(τ )e−|x|S(τ,θ,λ)dτ + O(e−|x|[ϕ(θ,λ)+γ2]),

|x| → ∞.

We represent the integral over l as the sum of the integrals over ln, and then write each
of the latter integrals as the value of the integrand at an intermediate point τn + σn, 0 ≤
σn ≤ 1/|x|, multiplied by |ln| = 1/|x|. This implies

|x|−d/2h(τn + σn)e−|x|S(τn+σn,θ,λ) + O(e−|x|[ϕ(θ,λ)+γ2]),

|x| → ∞.

I = Xn: |τn−τ (0)|<δ

Since

|S(τn + σn, θ, λ) − S(τn, θ, λ)| ≤ max

|τ −τ (0)|<δ |Sτ|σn ≤ ε/|x|,

and ε is small, we have

e−|x|S(τn+σn,θ,λ) = e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ)(1 + ηn),

|ηn| < 2ε.

18

The function h is smooth and bounded from above and below by positive constants. Hence
h(τn + σn) = h(τn)(1 + O(1/|x|)). The last two relations allow us to rewrite I in the form
|x| → ∞.

|x|−d/2h(τn)e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ)(1+ξn)+O(e−|x|[ϕ(θ,λ)+γ2]),

|ξn| < 3ε,

I = Xn: |τn−τ (0)|<δ

Hence

1 + 3ε ≤ Xn: |τn−τ (0)|<δ
bI

|x|−d/2h(τn)e−|x|S(τn,θ,λ) ≤bI(1 + 3ε),

|x| → ∞,

(46)

where bI = I + O(e−|x|[ϕ(θ,λ)+γ2]). To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains only to

replace I by its asymptotics as |x| → ∞ given by the Laplace method, and then combine
(46) (where ε is arbitrary small) with (45).

6 Propagation of the front

Let u = u(t, x) be the density of a population with initial density u0(x) being a non-
negative continuous function with a compact support. It satisﬁes the equations

∂u
∂t

= (L + v(x))u,

u(0, x) = u0(x).

(47)

We assume that the potential v is non-negative, continuous and has a compact support.
If the Hamiltonian H = L + v has a positive ground state energy, then the expected total
location of the propagating front F (t) := {u(t, x) : u = 1}. This problem will be studied
in this section when the transition density a(y) has an ultra light tail, i.e., (31) holds.
However, in the supplementary lemmas below we assume only that the transition density

population RRd u(t, x)dx grows with time, and an important question is to describe the
a(y) has a light tail, i.e., |a(y)| < Ce−δ|y| with some δ > 0, and thereforeba(k) is analytic

in k when |Imk| < δ. We also will extend assumption (7) somewhat by requiring that

(48)

for some ε0 < δ.

kba(k + iτ )kL1(Rd

k) ≤ C,

|τ| ≤ ε0,

The following lemma can be proved by repeating the standard arguments used to show

that Fourier transforms of L1-functions decay at inﬁnity.

Lemma 6.1. Let a(y) have a light tail. Then the function |ba(z)|, z = k + iτ, decays

uniformly in τ in each region |τ| ≤ δ1 < δ when |k| → ∞.

The next lemma provides an estimate for the transition density p given by (15).

19

Lemma 6.2. Let a(y) have a light tail and (48) hold. Then there exist constants α < ∞
and C < ∞ such that the following estimate holds
p(t, x) ≤ Cteαε2t−ε|x|,

x 6= 0,

for small enough ε ≥ 0.

Proof. We write p in the form (18) and omit the ﬁrst term on the right since we
assume that x 6= 0. From Lemma 6.2 it follows that Rd in the second term in the right-
hand side of (18) can be replaced by Rd + iτ,|τ| < δ. Thus

w(t, z)ei(z,x)dk,

z = k + iτ,

|τ| < δ, w := etba(z) − 1, x 6= 0. (49)

e−t

(2π)dZRd

p(t, x) =

Note that

|w(t, z)| ≤ t|ba(z)|,

z = k + iτ,

|w(t, z)| ≤ 2etReba(z) ≤ 2t|ba(z)|etReba(z) ≤ Ct|ba(z)|et sup Reba(z),

if t|ba(z)| ≤ 1 or t|ba(z)| > 1 and Reba(z) ≤ 0. If t|ba(z)| > 1 and Reba(z) > 0, then
where the supremum is taken over k ∈ Rd. Since ba(0) = 1 (see (6)), we have that
sup Reba(z) > 1/2 when |τ| is small enough. Then (50) is valid in all the cases. We will

take τ = εx/|x|, ε ≤ ε0 with small enough ε0 > 0. Then (49), (50) and (48) imply that

z = k + iτ,

(50)

p ≤ Ctet(sup Reba(z)−1)−ε|x|,

z = k + iτ, ε ≤ ε0.

In order to complete the proof of Lemma 6.2, it remains to show the existence of an

α such that

k ∈ Rd,

(51)
if ε ≥ 0 is small enough. Due to Lemma 6.1, there exists R < ∞ such that (51) holds
with α = 0 when |k| ≥ R. Estimate (51) with |k| ≤ R and ε ≥ 0 is small enough follows

Reba(k + iτ ) − 1 ≤ αε2,

from the Taylor expansion sinceba(z) is smooth (analytic),ba(k) is real, and Reba(k) ≤ 1.

The asymptotics of the Green function Gλ(x), λ > 0, as |x| → ∞, will be used below
(see Theorem 5.2) and therefore, it will be assumed that a(y) has an ultra light tail, i.e.,
(31) holds.

Theorem 6.3. Let u be the solution of the problem (47), where the transition density
a(y) has an ultra light tail, (48) holds, and operator H = L + v(x) has a unique positive
eigenvalue λ = λ0.

Then the front F (t) has the form |x| = λ0t+ 1−d

ϕ(θ,λ0) + O(1), t → ∞, where ϕ is deﬁned
in (39). The density u grows (decays) exponentially in time uniformly in x in any region
inside (outside, respectively) the front whose distance from the front exceeds γt with some
γ > 0.

Remark. In the case of light tails, the total number of positive eigenvalues of operator
H is at most ﬁnite. This will be proved elsewhere. If there are several positive eigenvalues,
then each of them generates its own front. Since it is not clear which of them propagates
faster, the total front of the population can be obtained as the maximum of the fronts
generated by individual eigenvalues.

Proof of Theorem 6.3. The spectrum of the operator H = L + v consists of the
interval [−a, 0] and a point λ0 > 0. Using the spectral decomposition theorem, we obtain
that

eλtdEλu0dλ + c0φ0(x)eλ0t,

(52)

u(t, x) =Z 0

−a

where Eλ is the spectral projection operator, φ0 is a normalized eigenfunction with the
eigenvalue λ0, and c0 = (u0, φ0). Denote by w the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side above.
Obviously, kwkL2 ≤ ku0kL2 for all t ≥ 0. We will show that the front is deﬁned mostly by
the second term in (52). Some estimate on w is needed to justify this fact.

Function w satisﬁes the relations

∂w
∂t − Lw = −v(x)w,

u(0, x) = u0(x) − c0φ0(x),

and therefore w = u1 + u2, where

u1 =Z t
0 ZRd

p(t − τ, x − y)v(y)w(τ, y)dydτ, u2 =ZRd

p(t, x − y)[u0(y) − c0φ0(y)]dy.

Since kvwkL1 ≤ CkwkL2 ≤ C, from Lemma 6.2 it follows that
teαε2t−ε|x|dτ = Ct2eαε2t−ε|x|

|u1| ≤ CZ t

0

(53)

when x does not belong to the support of v and ε ≥ 0 is small enough. We write u2 as
the sum u21 + u22 by separating the terms in the square brackets in the expression for
u2. Obviously, an estimate similar to (53) (with the factor t2 replaced by t) is valid for
u21 when x does not belong to the support of u0 and ε ≥ 0 is small enough. In order to
estimate u22, we note that equation (L + v)φ0 = −λ0φ0 implies that φ0 = −Gλ0(vφ0) has
the same asymptotics at inﬁnity as Gλ0, which is given by Theorem 5.2, i.e.,

From (18), Lemma 6.2, and (54), it follows that

φ0 = g(θ, λ0)|x|(1−d)/2e−|x|ϕ(θ,λ0)(1 + o(1)),
|u22 + c0e−tφ0(x)| ≤ CZRd

teαε2t−ε|x−y|e−γ|y|dy

|x| → ∞.

(54)

with some γ > 0. Thus,

|u22| ≤ C(1 + t)eαε2t−ε|x|.

21

By combining estimates for u1, u21, u22, we obtain that
|w| ≤ C(1 + t2)eαε2t−ε|x|

(55)

In order to complete the proof of the theorem, we split Rd in the following regions

when x does not belong to the supports of v and u0, and ε ≥ 0 is small enough.
that depend on time. The central region D0 ⊂ Rd is deﬁned by inequalities

< c0φ0(x)eλ0t < 2.

Asymptotics (54) implies that the solution of the equation c0φ0(x)eλ0t = c has the form
|x| = λ0t+ 1−d
ϕ(θ,λ0) + O(1), t → ∞. We denote the remainder term by O1(1), O2(1) when
c = 1/2, 2, respectively. Here O1(1) > O2(1), and D0 can be rewritten, for large t, as
follows

By D1 ⊂ Rd we denote the region where one of the following inequalities hold as t → ∞:

ϕ(θ, λ0) }, D3 = {x :

|x| >

t → ∞.

Since c0φ0(x)eλ0t grows exponentially in t when x ∈ D2, estimate (55) with ε =
0 implies that u, x ∈ D2, grows exponentially as t → ∞. Since c0φ0(x)eλ0t decays
exponentially in t when x ∈ D3, estimate (55) with small enough ε > 0 implies that
(55) with small enough ε = 0 it follows that w decays exponentially when x ∈ D1, t → ∞.
Hence u > 3

u, x ∈ D3, decays exponentially as t → ∞. Thus front F (t) belongs to D1S D0. From

7 Limit of the population density as t → ∞.
Assume now that the Hamiltonian H = L + w does not have positive spectrum. Then
one can expect that the total population does not grow with time and the distribution
density has a limit as t → ∞. We will prove the latter facts under a somewhat stronger
assumption than the absence of the positive spectrum. Recall (see Theorem 4.2) that the
absence of the positive spectrum requires the underlying process with the generator L
to be transient. Moreover, the potential has to be small enough. Additionally, we will

22

assume that the norm of the operator G0v in the space C = Cb(Rd) of continuous bounded
functions (kukC = supx|u|) is less than one. Here G0 is the operator deﬁned in (16) and
G0vψ := G0(vψ). At the end of the section, we will provide an estimate on v that implies
kG0vk < 1. We do not impose any restrictions on the tail of the transition density a(y).
We will consider the population with a constant initial distribution, i.e., the density
u = u(t, x) ∈ C T is the solution of the problem

∂u
∂t

= (L + v(x))u,

u(0, x) = 1.

(56)

Here T is arbitrary and C T is the space of functions that are continuous in (t, x) and
bounded when x ∈ Rd, 0 ≤ t ≤ T , with kukC T = sup(t,x)|u|. We are not going to discuss
the uniqueness in the space C T . Instead we study a speciﬁc solution in C T that can be
obtained from the corresponding integral equation (see more details in the proof of the
theorem below).

Theorem 7.1. Let H = L + v not have positive spectrum and kG0vkC < 1. Then the
solution u = u(t, x) ∈ C T of problem (56) has a limit in the space C as t → ∞ and
limt→∞ u = (1 − G0v)−11.

We will need the following analogue of Lemma 6.2. Denote by Ptf solution u = u(t, x)

of the unperturbed problem

ut = Lu,

t > 0,

u(0, x) = f (x) ∈ Ccom,

that is obtained by convolution with the fundamental solution (15):

u = Ptf =ZRd

p(t, x − y)f (y)dy.

Lemma 7.2. Let p(t, x) be the transition density of a transient random walk with the
generator L. Then for each f ∈ C with the support in the ball |x| < R and each T < ∞,
the function Ptf belongs to C T , and

kPtfkC T ≤ C(R, T )kfkC.

Proof. From (18) it follows that Ptf = e−tf + e−tF −1w, where the second term is the

inverse Fourier transform of w = [etba(k)−1]bf (k). It is enough to prove the statement of the
lemma for the term F −1w. Since |bf (k)| ≤ C(R)kfkC and ketba(k) − 1kL1 ≤ CkTba(k)kL1 =

CT (due to (7)), it follows that F −1w is continuous in x and |F −1w| ≤ C(R, T ), t ≤
T. Obviously, w as element of L1, depends smoothly on t. This implies that F −1w is
continuous in (t, x).

Proof of Theorem 7.1. From the Duhamel’s principle, it follows that every solution

u ∈ C T of (56) satisﬁes the equation

u = 1 +Z t

0

Pt−s(vu(s,·))ds.

(57)

Equation (57) is uniquely solvable in C T , and its solution satisﬁes (56). Theorem 7.1
concerns this solution u. Indeed, the unique solvability of (57) follows immediately from
the facts that equation (57) is of the Volterra type and the operator Ptv : C → C is
bounded uniformly in t ∈ [0, T ]. Moreover, solution u ∈ C T can be obtained by iterations:

u =

∞X0

(Qt)n1, Qtf =Z t

0

Pt−s(vf (s,·),

t ≤ T.

(58)

It remains to ﬁnd the limit of u as t → ∞.
Assume that f (s, x) has the following properties: f ≥ 0, f (s1, x) ≥ f (s2, x) when
s1 > s2, and there is a limit f0(x) := lims→∞ f (s, x) ∈ C. Then Qtf has the same
properties as f and
(59)

Qtf ↑ G0(vf0) as

t → ∞.

Indeed,

Qtf =Z t

0

p(s, x − y)v(y)f (t − s, y)dyds.

(60)

The latter relation and Lemma 3.1 imply that Qtf ≥ 0 and Qtf is monotone in t. An
upper bound for Qtf can be obtained by putting t = ∞ in the right-hand side of (60).
Since the process with the transition density p(t, x) is transient, it follows that

Z ∞

0

p(s, x − y)ds = G0(x − y),

and therefore Qtf ≤ G0(vf0). Thus Qtf has a limit as t → ∞ and limt→∞ Qtf ≤ G0(vf0).
The lower bound for limt→∞ Qtf is the same, as also follows from (60):

Qtf ≥Z t/2

0

p(s, x − y)v(y)f (t − s, y)dyds ≥Z t/2

0

p(s, x − y)v(y)f (t/2, y)dyds.

By passing to the limit in the last inequality as t → ∞, we obtain that limt→∞ Qtf ≥
G0(vf0). Hence, (59) is proved.
Using (59), one can easily show by induction that (Qt)n1 ↑ (G0v)n1. This and (58)

complete the proof of the theorem.

We will conclude this section by providing a suﬃcient condition for the estimate

kG0vk < 1.

Lemma 7.3. The following estimate holds

The statement follows immediately from the relation G0 = I + T0, where T0 is given

by (17).
