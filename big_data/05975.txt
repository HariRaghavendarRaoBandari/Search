Recently, a braking index for the pulsar PSR J1640-4631 has been measured. With a braking
index of n = 3.15±0.03, this pulsar has the highest braking index ever measured. As it is well known,
a pure magnetic dipole brake yields n = 3, whereas a pure gravitational wave (GW) brake yields
n = 5. Therefore, each of these mechanisms alone can not account for the braking index found for
PSR J1640-4631. Here we propose that such a braking index could be accounted for if the spindown
model combines magnetic dipole and GW brakes. Then, we brieﬂy discuss the detectability of this
pulsar by aLIGO and the planned Einstein Telescope. In particular, we show that the amplitude
of the GW that comes from our model is around a factor four lower than the amplitude modeled
exclusively by GW energy loss. Another interesting outcome of our modeling is that it is possible
to obtain the ellipticity from the braking index and other pulsar parameters.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One hundred years after being predicted and decades of
experimental eﬀorts later, the gravitational waves (GWs)
have been ﬁnally detected [1]. A signal was observed
by the LIGO detectors and comes from the coalescence
of a binary black hole system. Besides the binary sys-
tems composed of compact stars, there are more possible
sources of GWs, among them the pulsars (spinning neu-
tron stars), that could well be detected in the near future.
The so called braking index, which is closely related
to the pulsars spindown, can provide information about
the energy loss of these objects. Until very recently,
only eight of ∼ 2400 known pulsars have measured
braking indices with values ranging from 0.9 ± 0.2 to
2.839 ± 0.001 [see e.g., 2–8]. The magnetic dipole as-
sumption predicts a braking index n = 3. Several in-
terpretations of the observed braking indices have been
put forward, like the ones that propose either accretion
of fall-back material via a circumstellar disk [9], relativis-
tic particle winds [10, 11], or modiﬁed canonical models
to explain the observed braking index ranges [see e.g.,
12, 13], and references therein for further models). Alter-
natively, it has been proposed that the so-called quantum
vacuum friction (QVF) eﬀect in pulsars can explain sev-
eral aspects of their phenomenology [14–16]. However,
no model has been developed yet that explains satisfac-
tory all measured braking indices, nor any of the existing
ones has been totally ruled out by current data. There-
fore energy loss mechanisms for pulsars are still under
debate.

Recently, Archibald et al. [17] showed that the PSR
J1640-4631 is the ﬁrst to have a braking index greater
than the canonical value (three), n = 3.15 ± 0.03. PSR
J1640-4631 has a spin period of P = 206 ms and a spin-
˙P = 9.758(44) × 10−13 s/s, yielding a spin-
down rate of

down power ˙Erot = 4.4 × 1036 erg/s, and inferred dipole
magnetic ﬁeld B0 = 1.4×1013 G. This source was discov-
ered using X-ray timing observations from NuStar and a
measured distance of ∼ 12 kpc [see 18].

Also LIGO and VIRGO have released their results on
the search for continuous GWs putting forward upper
limits for the sources ellipticities [19–21]. The results
show that the typical ellipticity would be ε < 2 × 10−5.
Moreover aLIGO (advanced LIGO) has just completed its
ﬁrst observational run (O1) and observed the ﬁrst GW
transient [1]. Now ∼ 4 months are being analyzed and
new results for the search for continuous signals might be
released soon.

In this letter, we are concerned about this interesting
source in two diﬀerent ways: i) the electromagnetic emis-
sion of a neutron star derived from its rotational kinetic
energy, and its spindown is usually measured in terms of
a braking index, n, which is dependent on the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration; ii) however, pulsars can also spindown
through gravitational emission associated to asymmet-
ric deformations. The observed rotational energy loss
provides a huge reservoir of energy, along with magnetic
dipole radiation some fraction of this reservoir is dissi-
pated through GW emission [see e.g., 22, 23].

The recently braking index n = 3.15 measured for the
rotationally powered pulsar PSR J1640-4631 reignites the
question about the fundamental energy loss mechanisms
in pulsars. Our interest in this work is to explore gravi-
tational and electromagnetic contributions in the context
of this pulsar which n > 3.

This letter is organized as follows. In the next section
we revisit the fundamental energy loss mechanisms for
pulsars. We also derive its associated energy loss focusing
mainly on the energy balance and model self-consistency
when both gravitational and classic dipole radiation are
responsible for the PSR J1640-4631 spindown. In Section
III, we summarize the main conclusions and remarks. We
work here with Gaussian units.

II. THE ENERGY BALANCE OF PSR

J1640-4631

As already mentioned, we consider that the main en-
ergy loss sources of PSR J1640-4631 are magnetic dipole
brake and GW emission.

Recall that if the pulsar magnetic dipole moment is
misaligned with its spin axis by an angle φ, the energy
emitted per second by a rotating magnetic dipole reads
[see e.g., 24, 25],

˙Ed =

16π4

B2

0 R6 sin2 φ

P 4c3

,

(1)

where B0 is the mean surface magnetic ﬁeld of a star of
radius R and rotational period P .

Spinning neutron stars which possess asymmetric de-
formations emit GWs. More precisely, a body with mo-
ment of inertia, I, and equatorial ellipticity, , emits
GWs.
In this case, the energy loss via GW emission
reads [see e.g., 26]

2

Notice that the above deﬁnition implies that ˙ΩGW =
η ˙Ωrot. Thus η can also be interpreted as the fraction
of the power lost by the pulsar in the form of GWs, or
also the eﬃciency of generation of GWs. It is appropri-
ate to rewrite the equation for η in terms of the braking
index, that is given by

n =

Ωrot ¨Ωrot

˙Ω2
rot

.

(8)

Before proceeding it is worth recalling that a pure mag-
netic brake, in which a dipole magnetic conﬁguration is
adopted, gives n = 3, whereas a pure GW brake gives
n = 5. Therefore, neither a pure GW brake nor a pure
magnetic dipole brake are not supported by the obser-
vations. On the other hand, a combination of both pro-
cesses of energy loss considered in the present letter could
account for the braking index of, for example, PSR J1640-
4631.

Substituting equation 4 and its derivative in equation

An absolute upper limit on the GW strain from iso-
lated pulsars, known as the spindown limit, can be cal-
culated assuming the observed loss of rotational energy
( ˙Erot = IΩ ˙Ω) is all going into gravitational radiation, i.e.
˙EGW [see, e.g., 27]. Instead, we shall consider in this let-
ter that the total energy emitted by the star is provided
by its rotational counterpart, Erot = IΩ2
rot/2, and any
change on it would be attributed to both ˙Ed and ˙EGW,
namely

This equation naturally leads to values of the brake
indices 3 ≤ n ≤ 5. Notice that combining equations 7
and 9, one obtains

n − 3

η =

Therefore, η is directly related to the observable quantity
n. An immediate consequence thereof is that

˙Erot ≡ ˙EGW + ˙Ed.

This equation can be interpreted as follows: the term on
the left side stands for the resulting deceleration (spin-
down) due to the emission of GWs and the magnetic
brakes, the ﬁrst and second terms on the right side
represent the independent contributions of each one of
these processes. The above equation can be conveniently
rewritten as follows

˙Ωrot = ˙ΩGW + ˙Ωd.

(5)

It is useful to deﬁne the fraction of deceleration (η) re-
lated to the GW emission, namely

η =

Since the angular velocity is directly related to ˙frot, the

where we can interpret ˙¯frot as the part of

Now, we consider how the amplitude of the GWs for
pulsars with n < 5 can be calculated. Recall that one
usually ﬁnds in the literature the following equation

| ˙frot|

(13)

[see, e.g., 27], where the whole contribution to ˙frot comes
from the GW emission, i.e., its implicitly assumed that
n = 5. This equation must be modiﬁed to take into ac-
count that n < 5. To do so the equation for the amplitude
of the GW can be written in the following form

¯h2 =

where equation 12 was substituted in the last equality.
From the above equation one has for PSR J1640-4631
that ¯h (cid:39) 0.27h, i.e., almost a factor of four lower than
the amplitude found when one assumes that the energy
loss is completely given by GW emission. Notice that in
the present case, since n = 3.15, η = 0.075, which means
that the GW luminosity would be 7.5% of the total power
lost ( ˙Erot).

Whether it is not possible to explain such a ﬁgure ap-
propriately, this could be an indication that other mech-
anisms, apart of GW and dipole magnetic brakes must
necessarily be considered. As a consequence thereof it
could well occur that η (cid:28) 0.075 implying that  (cid:28) 10−3,
or vice-versa.

III. SUMMARY

In this letter we model the PSR J1640-4631 spindown
by means of a combination of energy loss mechanisms
which includes GW emission and magnetic dipole brake.
We have shown that with this modeling it could be possi-
ble to account for this pulsar braking index. But, in this
case it is mandatory to explain how it is possible to have
a high ellipticity.

Concerning the detectability of PSR J1640-4631 via its
putative gravitational emission, we conclude that aLIGO,
even for one year integration time, would not observe it.
On the other hand, since the planned ET is more sensi-
tivity than aLIGO at such frequency, it would be able to
detect PSR J1640-4631 with the appropriate integration
time. Bearing in mind the high ellipticity implicit in this
calculation.

An interesting question that deserves to be appro-
priately addressed has to do with the modeling of all
other eight pulsars with braking indices measured accu-
rately. Due to their dynamic nature, pulsars should al-
ways present important temporal changes in quantities
other than P , such as B0 and φ. Moreover, since the
pulsars’ ellipticities are very likely non null, the contri-
bution of GW brake needs necessarily to be considered.
We argue that, no matter what are the other mechanisms
considered in order to explain the measured braking in-
dex, the GW contribution must necessarily be taken into
account.

Last, but not least, a model that takes into account,
besides the GW and the magnetic dipole brakes, B0 and φ
dependent on time, could also provide a picture in which
the braking index of PSR J1640–4631 could be explained
without the need of such a high ellipticity. These issues
are part of a study to appear elsewhere.
