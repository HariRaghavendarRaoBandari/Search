Abstract

Let µ2(G) be the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of a graph G, and let κ(G)
be the minimum size of a vertex set S such that G − S is disconnected. Fiedler proved
that µ2(G) ≤ κ(G) for a non-complete simple graph G; for this reason µ2(G) is called
the “algebraic connectivity” of G. We extend his result to multigraphs. For a pair of
vertices u and v, let m(u, v) be the number of edges with endpoints u and v. For a
vertex v, let m(v) = maxu∈N (v) m(v, u), where N (v) is the set of neighbors of v, and
let m(G) = maxv∈V (G) m(v). We prove that for any multigraph G, except when G is a
multigraph obtained from a complete graph by duplicating edges, µ2(G) ≤ κ(G)m(G).
We also prove that for a d-regular multigraph G, except for the 2-vertex d-regular
multigraph, if µ2(G) > d
4 , then G is 2-connected. For t ≥ 2 and inﬁnitely many d, we
construct d-regular multigraphs H with µ2(H) = d, κ(H) = t, and m(H) = d
t . These
graphs show that the inequality µ2(G) ≤ κ(G)m(G) is sharp. In addition, we prove
that if G is a d-regular multigraph, except for a graph obtained from a complete graph
by duplicating edges, then µ2(G) ≤ d; equality holds for the graphs in the construction.

1 Preliminaries

In this paper, we treat both a simple graph and a multigraph, where a simple graph is a graph
without loops or multiple edges and a multigraph is a graph that may have multiple edges
but does not contain loops. The adjacency matrix A(G) of G is the n-by-n matrix in which
the entry ai,j is the number of edges in G with endpoints {vi, vj}, where V (G) = {v1, ..., vn}.
The eigenvalues of G are the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix A(G). Let λ1(G) and λ2(G)
be the largest eigenvalue and the second largest eigenvalue of G, respectively. The Laplacian
matrix of G is D(G) − A(G), where D(G) is the diagonal matrix of degrees. Let µ1(G) and
µ2(G) be the smallest Laplacian eigenvalue and the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue
of G. Note that µ1(G) = 0 for any graph G and if G is d-regular, then λ1(G) = d, and
λ2(G) = d − µ2(G), thus λ2(G) and µ2(G) are directly related.

A simple graph or multigraph G is k-connected if G has more than k vertices and every
subgraph obtained by deleting fewer than k vertices is connected; the connectivity of G,
written κ(G), is the maximum k such that G is k-connected. By Fiedler’s result [5], stating
that

κ(G) ≥ µ2(G)

(1)

for a non-complete simple graph G, we call µ2(G) the algebraic connectivity of G. In this
paper, we extend his result to multigraphs. For a pair of vertices u and v, let m(u, v) be
the number of edges. For a vertex v, let m(v) = maxu∈N (v) m(v, u), where N(v) is the set
of neighbors of v, and let m(G) = maxv∈V (G) m(v). We call m(G) the multiplicity of a
multigraph G. In Section 2, we show that when we consider a multigraph, µ2(G) is bounded
above by the product of κ(G) and m(G). This implies Fielder’s inequality (1) by taking
m(G) = 1. The graphs constructed in Section 4 show the tightness of the bound.

A simple graph or multigraph G is t-edge-connected if every subgraph obtained by deleting
fewer than t edges is connected; the edge-connectivity of G, written κ′(G), is the maximum
t such that G is t-edge-connected. Note that κ′(G) ≥ κ(G).

A lot of research in graph theory over the last 40 years was stimulated by Fiedler’s
inequality (1). Recently, many researchers proved upper bounds for λ2(G) (or µ2(G)) in a
d-regular simple graph G to guarantee a certain edge-connectivity (See [3], [8], [4]). The
author ([10]) extended their results to multigraphs.
Theorem 1.1. If G is a d-regular multigraph with λ2(G) < d−1+√9d2−10d+17
Theorem 1.2. For t ≥ 2, if G is a d-regular multigraph with λ2(G) < d − t, then κ′(G) ≥
t + 1. Furthermore, if t is odd and G is a d-regular multigraph with λ2(G) < d − t + 1, then
κ′(G) ≥ t + 1.

, then κ′(G) ≥ 2.

4

Note that the bounds for λ2(G) in Theorem 1.1 and 1.2 can be transformed to µ2(G) >
and µ2(G) > t or t − 1, respectively, since µ2(G) = d − λ2(G). Also, in

Theorem 1.1 and 1.2, complete graphs are the exceptions although he did not mention in
the theorems.

He also characterized when a d-regular multigraph G has λ2(G) = θ(d, t) and κ′(G) = t

for every positive integer t ∈ [d − 1], where

Cheeger inequality ([7]) for d-regular multigraphs states that

≤ hG ≤p2d(d − λ2(G)),

(2)

and m[S, S] is the number of edges with one endpoint
where hG = minS⊆V and 1≤|S|≤n/2
each in sets S and S. Inequality (2) informally says that if the gap between λ1(G) and λ2(G)
(or µ2(G)) is higher, then the edge-connectivity may be larger. In fact, Theorem 1.1 and 1.2
say that as λ2 is small, κ′(G) is large.

|S|

Many researchers investigated relationships between λ2 (or µ2) and κ′ in a d-regular
[multi-]graph as seen above. In this paper, we study a relationship between µ2 (or λ2) and
κ in a d-regular multigraph. This paper is the ﬁrst one to contribute to such a relationship.
In Section 2, we provide a lower bound for µ2(G) (an upper bound for λ2(G)) in a d-regular
multigraph G to guarantee κ(G) ≥ 2.

Theorem 1.3. If G is a d-regular multigraph with µ2(G) > d
regular multigraph, then κ(G) ≥ 2.

4, except for the 2-vertex d-

Furthermore, for any ﬁxed positive integer t ≥ 2 and inﬁnitely many d, we construct
d-regular multigraphs Hd,t such that κ(Hd,t) = t and µ2(Hd,t) = d in Section 4. This means
that although µ2 is ﬁxed like d, the connectivity of a d-regular graph G might vary. This is
a kind of evidence that µ2 (or λ2) may not be closely related to the connectivity while it is
deeply related to the edge-connectivity.

There is a vertex version of Cheeger inequality ([2]), stating that

hout(G) ≤ (p4(d − λ2(G)) + 1)2 − 1,

hin(G) ≤p8(d − λ2(G)),

where for any vertex subset T in V (G), N(T ) = {v ∈ V (G) : v is adjacent to a vertex in T },

The existence of Hd,t says that the connectivity of a d-regular graph may not inﬂuence its
algebraic connectivity. This fact supports a reason why there is no lower bound for neither
hout nor hin related to d − λ2 (or µ2).

Furthermore, by using the Interlacing Theorem (See Theorem 4.1), we observe that for
any multigraph G, α(G)-th largest eigenvalue is non-negative, where α(G) is the maximum
size of a vertex set S such that any pair of vertices in S is adjacent. This fact implies that
µ2(G) ≤ d when G is a d-regular multigraph, except for a graph obtained from a complete
graph by duplicating edges. Graphs Hd,t say that this inequality µ2(G) ≤ d is tight for
d-regular multigraphs G regardless of κ(G).

For undeﬁned terms, see West [13] or Godsil and Royle [6].

2 Extenstion of Fiedler’s Inequality to Multigraphs

Fiedler’s inequality (1) does not hold for some multigraphs. For example, let H(d, 2) be the
graph obtained from the cylcle on 4 vertices by duplicating each edge d
2 times. Then we
have κ(H(d, 2)) = 2 and µ2(H(d, 2)) = d. Thus for a multigraph G, µ2(G) can be much
bigger than κ(G). Then it is natural to ask whether there is another factor to bound µ2(G)
in multigraphs and also how large µ2(G) can be in terms of κ(G) and the factor. We recall
the multiplicity of a multigraph. For a pair of vertices u and v, let m(u, v) be the number of
edges. For a vertex v, let m(v) = maxu∈N (v) m(v, u), where N(v) is the set of the neighbors
of v, and let m(G) = maxv∈V (G) m(v). We call m(G) the multiplicity of a multigraph G.
Note that m(H(d, 2)) = d
2. In this section, we show that the multiplicity of a graph G is
such a factor and µ2(G) is bounded above by the product of κ(G) and m(G).

Before proving it, we introduce the following theorem, which is a consequence of the

well-known Courant-Fisher Theorem [5].

Theorem 2.1. Let 0 be the null vector and let 1 be the all 1’s column vector. For any
connected multigraph G, since L(G)1 = 01, we have

µ2(G) = min

x6=0,x⊥1

xT L(G)x

xT x

.

(4)

Theorem 2.2. For a multigraph G, which is not a graph obtained from a complete graph by
duplicating edges, we have

µ2(G) ≤ κ(G)m(G).

(5)

Proof. Let |V (G)| = n, and assume that G is not a graph obtained from the complete graph
Kn by duplicating edges. Thus κ(G) < n − 1, which implies that there exists a vertex set S
such that the algebraic connectivity of the graph induced by G − S equals 0.

4

Pick a vertex u ∈ V (G). Let Gu be the graph obtained from G by removing the vertex
u, and let Gu,v be the graph obtained from Gu and a single vertex v by adding m(G) edges
between v and each vertex in V (Gu). Then the Laplacian matrix of Gu,v is

 L(Gu) + m(G)In−1

−m(G)1T

−m(G)1

m(G)(n − 1)! .

Let x be an eigenvector of L(Gu) corresponding to the eigenvalue µ2(Gu). By Theorem 2.1,
we have

L(Gu,v) x

0! = [µ2(Gu) + m(G)] x
0! .

Since µ2(Gu) + m(G) is an eigenvalue of L(Gu,v) and µ2(G) + m(G) > 0, we have

µ2(G) ≤ µ2(Gu,v) ≤ µ2(Gu) + m(G).

By applying κ(G) times, since G is not a graph obtained from a complete graph by dupli-
cating edges, we have the desired result.

The graph H(d, 2) satisﬁes equality in inequality (5). More graphs satisfying the equality
will be appeared in Section 4. When G is simple (m(G) = 1), we have the Fiedler’s inequality.

Corollary 2.3. For a non-complete simple graph G, we have

µ2(G) ≤ κ(G).

Since κ′(G) ≥ κ(G) for any multigraph G, we have the following.

Corollary 2.4. For a multigraph G, which is not a graph obtained from the complete graph
Kn by duplicating each edge same number of times, we have

µ2(G) ≤ κ′(G)m(G).

(6)

We could not ﬁnd any multigraph satisfying equality in inequality (6) when m(G) ≥ 2.
However, there exist inﬁnitely many graphs whose algebraic connectivity is bigger than their
edge-connectivity. Of course, some of them are not graphs obtained from complete graphs by
duplicating edges. For example, consider the graph F obtained from the cycle on 4 vertices
by duplicating d−1
times on the other two incident
2
edges. Then µ2(F ) = 3d
and κ′(F ) = d − 1, which means µ2(F ) > κ′(F ). We believe
that there is no big gap between µ2 and κ′ unlike between µ2 and κ.

Question 2.5. Is there a constant c such that µ2(G) ≤ κ′(G) + c for any multigraph G?

If there exists such a constant, then it would be additional fact that µ2 is more closely
related to κ′ than κ. Thus µ2 should be called algebraic edge-connectivity instead of algebraic
connectivity.

3 How does κ(G) = 1 aﬀect µ2(G)?

In this section, we prove a lower bound for µ2(G) in a d-regular multigraph G to guarantee
κ(G) ≥ 2. To prove it, we use the quotient matrix method. Consider a partition V (G) =
V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vs of the vertex set of a graph G into s non-empty subsets. For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s, let bi,j
denote the average number of neighbours in Vj of the vertices in Vi. The quotient matrix of
this partition is the s × s matrix whose (i, j)-th entry equals bi,j.

Theorem 3.1. (See Corollay 2.5.4 in [1], Lemma 9.6.1 in [6]) The eigenvalues of the quo-
tient matrix interlace the eigenvalues of G.

This partition is equitable if for each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s, any vertex v ∈ Vi has exactly bi,j
neighbours in Vj. In this case, the eigenvalues of the quotient matrix are eigenvalues of G
and the spectral radius of the quotient matrix equals the spectral radius of G (see [1, 6] for
more details).

Theorem 3.1 is the main tool to prove Theorem 1.3. The proof of Theorem 1.3 can be
4 and

4, but we will have more cases to characterize when µ2(G) = d

shorter to show µ2(G) > d
κ(G) = 1.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. It suﬃces to prove that if λ2(G) < 3
4 d, then κ(G) ≥ 2. Assume to
the contrary that κ(G) ≤ 1. If G is disconnected, then λ2(G) = d ≥ 3d
4 . Now, suppose
that κ(G) = 1. Let v be a vertex such that G − v is disconnected. Let G1 be a component
of G − v such that |N(v) ∩ V (G1)| ≤ d
2 . Let G2 = G − v − V (G1). Since G is d-regular,
we have |N(v) ∩ V (G2)| ≥ d
2. Let n1 = |V (G1)|, n2 = |V (G2)|, m1 = |V (G1) ∩ N(v)|, and
m2 = |V (G2) ∩ N(v)|. Note that both n1 and n2 are positive since G is not the 2-vertex
d-regular multigraph. Consider the vertex partition {V (G1), V (G2) ∪ v}. Let Q be the
quotient matrix of the partition. Then we have

Q ="d − m1

If d = 4k + 2 is for some positive integer k, then we can slightly improve the bound 3d

4 for
λ2(G) to d+2√d2+5
with more cases in the proof of Theorem 4.5. Of course, if d is not even,
then exactly one of n1 and n2 must be odd, meaning at least 3, and m1 ≤ d−1
2 and m2 ≥ d+1
by the degree-sum formula. Thus we can have other upper bounds for λ2(G) with many more
cases in the proof of Theorem 4.5. The bounds may be the largest roots of polynomials p1(x)
and p3(x) depending on the remainder when d is divided by 4, where p1(x) = −64x4 −16(d −
1)x3 + (36d2 + 8d + 84)x2 + (13d3 − 15d2 + 7d − 5)x + d4 − 3d3 − 25d2 − 25d − 12 and p3(x) =

However, we skip the parts because the proofs for them might be very similar with the

one of Theorem 4.5 with a lot more cases. When d = 3, see Theorem 1.1.

4 Sharp Examples, and κ(G) ≥ 2 may not aﬀect µ2(G)

In this section, by presenting a d-regular multigraph Hd,1 with κ(Hd,1) = 1 and µ2(Hd,1) = d
4,
we show that the lower bound for µ2 in Theorem 1.3 is sharp. Furthermore, for every positive
integer t ≥ 2, we construct d-regular multigraphs Hd,t with κ(Hd,t) = t, m(Hd,t) = d
t , and
µ2(Hd,t) = d. These graphs show that inequality (5) in Theorem 2.2 is sharp.

Observation 4.2 says that if G is not a multigraph obtained from a complete graph by
duplicating edges, then µ2(G) ≤ d. The graphs Hd,t guarantee that the bound cannot be
improved although the connectivity of a d-regular multigraph varies.

Theorem 4.1. (Interlacing theorem) (See [1],[6], Lemma 1.6 in [11]) If A is a real symmetric
n × n matrix and B is a principal submatrix of A with order m × m, then for each i ∈ [m],
the i-th largest eigenvalue of A is at least the i-th largest eigenvalue of B.

By using the Interlacing Theorem, we obtain the following observation.

Observation 4.2. For any graph G, the α(G)-th largest eigenvalue of G is non-negative,
where α(G) is the maximum size of a vertex set S of a graph G such that no pair of two
vertices in S is adjacent.

Proof. Let S be an independent set in V (G), and let AS be the adjacency matrix of the
graph induced by S. Note that AS has the eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity |S|. By using the
Interlacing Theorem, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , |S|}, the i-th largest eigenvalue of AS equal to 0 is
at most the i-th largest eigenvalue of A(G), which gives the desired result.

Observation 4.3. For a positive integer d ≥ 3, there exists only one multigraph with three
vertices such that every vertex has degree d, except only one vertex with degree d
2.

Figure 1: The 4-regular multigraph with λ2 = 3 and κ = 1

Proof. Let G be a multigraph with three vertices, say v1, v2, and v3 such that v1 and v2 have
degree d, and v3 has degree d
2. Let a, b, and c be the number of edges between v1 and v2,
between v2 and v3, and between v3 and v1, respectively. Since v1 and v2 have degree d, and
v3 has degree d
2 . Thus, we have
a = 3d

2 , we have a + c = a + b = d, b + c = d
4, which gives the desired result.

Hd,1 be the graph obtained from two copies of Bd,1 by identifying the vertices with degree

Let t ≥ 2 be ﬁxed. Suppose that for some non-negative integer k, d ≥ 3 is a positive
integer such that (t−2)d
t(t−1) = k. For any positive integer a, we can have inﬁnitely many d
satisfying the equality by taking d = at(t − 1). Let Cd,t be the graph obtained from the
complete graph Kt by duplicating each edge (t−2)d
t(t−1) times. Note that each vertex in Cd,t has
degree (t−2)d
. Let Hd,t be the graph obtained from two vertices x, y and one copy of Cd,t by
adding d
t edges between two x and each vertex in Cd,t and between y and each vertex in Cd,t.
Note that Hd,t is a d-regular multigraph with κ(Hd,t) = t and m(Hd,t) = d

Consider the subspace W ⊂ Rt+2 of vectors which are constant on each part of the two
part equitable partition. The lifted eigenvectors corresponding to the two roots of p(x) form
a basis for W . The remaining eigenvectors in a basis of eigenvectors for Ht can be chosen to
be perpendicular to the vectors in W . Thus, they may be chosen to be perpendicular to the
characteristic vectors of the parts in the two part equitable partition since these characteristic
vectors form a basis for W . This implies that these eigenvectors will correspond to the non-
trivial eigenvalues of the graph obtained as a disjoint union of 2K1 and Ct. The corresponding
eigenvalue will be − (t−2)d
t(t−1) with multiplicity (t − 1). These (t − 1) eigenvalues together with
the three roots of p(x) form the spectrum of the graph Ht. Thus λ2(Hd,t) = 0.

5 Questions

In this paper, for ﬁxed positive integer t, we proved best lower bounds for µ2(G) in a d-
regular multigraph G with κ(G) ≥ t. If we ﬁx the number of vertices, then what can we say
on µ2?

Question 5.1. For a positive integer t, what is the best lower bound for µ2(G) in an n-vertex

11

d-regular [multi-]graph G with x ≥ t + 1, where x = κ(G) or κ′(G)?

It may be possible to prove that if G is an n-vertex d-regular multigraph with µ2(G) >

n

9n−25 d, then κ(G) ≥ 2. However, the bound might be improved.

By Observation 4.2, a simple non-complete graph has the non-negative second largest
eigenvalue. Since λ2(Kn) = −1 for all n ≥ 2, we have that a simple graph G has a negative
λ2(G) if and only if G is a complete graph with at least two vertices. More generally, a simple
graph G has only one positive eigenvalue if and only if G is a complete multipartite graph,
where a complete multipartite multigraph is a multigraph whose vertices can be partitioned
into sets such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not in the same partite
set (See [12]).

Question 5.2. What is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a multigraph G to have only
one positive eigenvalue?

Note that the graph Hd,t is a complete multipartite graph with λ2(Hd,t) = 0. However,
there are complete multipartite multigraphs with a positive second largest eigenvalue. For
example, complete graphs with large multiplicity are such graphs. There are many graphs,
which are not graphs obtained from a complete graph by duplicating edges. Here is one
example. Let F4 be the graph obtained from complete graph on 4 vertices by duplicating
two non-incident edges d
2. Now, let G4
be the graph obtained from F4 and two vertices x, y by adding d
4 edges between x, y and each
2 +2)(2), − d
vertex in F4. Then G4 is a d-regular multigraph with eigenvalues d, −4+ 1
2 ,
where the exponent is the multiplicity. For d ≥ 8, we have λ2(G4) = −4 + 1
2 d. Note that G4
is a complete multipartite graph with a positive second largest eigenvalue. Thus we need a
diﬀerent family of graphs for such a condition.
