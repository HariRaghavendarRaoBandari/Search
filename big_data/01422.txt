SHORT NOTE ON THE NUMBER OF 1-ASCENTS IN DISPERSED

DYCK PATHS

KAIRI KANGRO, MOZHGAN POURMORADNASSERI, AND DIRK OLIVER THEIS

ABSTRACT. A dispersed Dyck path (DDP) of length n is a lattice path on N × N
from (0,0) to (n,0) in which the following steps are allowed: “up” (x, y) →
(x + 1, y + 1); “down” (x, y) → (x + 1, y − 1); and “right” (x,0) → (x + 1,0). An
ascent in a DDP is an inclusion-wise maximal sequence of consecutive up steps.
A 1-ascent is an ascent consisting of exactly 1 up step.
We give a closed formula for the total number of 1-ascents in all dispersed Dyck
paths of length n, #A191386 in Sloane’s OEIS. Previously, only implicit gener-
ating function relations and asymptotics were known.

A Dyck path of length n is a lattice path on N × N from (0,0) to (n,0) in which

1. INTRODUCTION

the following steps are allowed:

(+1, +1): up step (x,y) → (x + 1,y + 1);
(+1, −1): down step (x,y) → (x + 1,y − 1), if y > 0.

A dispersed Dyck path (DDP) of length n is a lattice path on N × N from (0,0) to
(n,0) in which the following additional steps are allowed:
(+1,0): right step (x,y) → (x + 1,y), only if y = 0.
Put differently, dispersed Dyck paths are Motzkin paths with no (+1,0)-steps at
positive heights.

An ascent in a DDP is an inclusion-wise maximal sequence of consecutive up

steps; a 1-ascent is an ascent consisting of exactly 1 up step.

We give a closed formula for the total number A(n) of 1-ascents in all dispersed
Dyck paths of length n. This is #A191386 in Sloane’s Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences, OEIS. Previously, only implicit generating function relations
and the following asymptotics were known [2]:

We prove the following.

A(n) ∼pn/p (cid:16)1 +pp /2n(cid:17) 2n−5/2.

Theorem 1. For n ≥ 1, the number of 1-ascents in all DDPs of length n + 2 is

A(n) = 2n−1 +

2. PROOF OF THE THEOREM

Denote by dd(n) the number of DDPs of length n. We repeat the following easy,

folklore, fact for the sake of completion.

Lemma 2 (Folklore). For n ≥ 0,

dd(n) =(cid:18) n

⌊n/2⌋(cid:19)

Proof. The proof is by a variant of the reﬂection method: We give a bijection be-
tween the set of all DDP of length n and the set of all paths from (0,0) to (n, −n%2)
in Z × Z using only up steps (+1, +1) and down steps (+1, −1). Here n%2 denotes
the remainder upon division by 2. We call the latter paths “plain paths”, PP.

Indeed, a DDP can be obtained from a PP in the following way. Wherever p
takes a step (x,0) → (x + 1, −1), let x′ be the next occurrence (i.e., smallest x′ > x)
of a step (x′, −1) → (x′ + 1,0), if such a step exists, or x′ := n otherwise. We the
reﬂect the PP in the x-axis interval [x + 1,x′] at the line y = 1/2, and replace the
down step (x,0) → (x + 1, −1) by a right step (x,0) → (x + 1,0). If x′ < n, we also
replace the up step (x′, −1) → (x′ + 1,0) by a right step (x′,0) → (x′ + 1,0).

This is performed for all parts of the PP which venture below the x-axis. We
leave to the reader the details of verifying that this indeed deﬁnes a bijection be-
tween the PPs and the DDPs.

in all DDPs of length n. Note that U (n) = D(n). Moreover, let pd(n) denote the
number of (proper) Dyck paths of length n (which is 0, if n is odd).

The next lemma states that the total number of right steps in all DDPs of length

2k is twice the total number of right steps in all DDPs of length 2k − 1.

Lemma 3. For k ≥ 1, R(2k) = 2R(2k − 1).

Proof. For k = 1, the equation holds. Let k ≥ 2.

There are an even number of right steps in a DDP of length 2k. Numbering them

from left to right (starting from 0), we count the right steps in pairs

“(2 jth right step, (2 j + 1)th right step)”

and then multiply by two for the total number. For every pair of right steps, there
are an even number (possibly 0) of steps between
(a) 0 and the the start of the ﬁrst right step in the pair
(b) the end point of the ﬁrst right step in the pair and the beginning of the second

one

(c) end point of the second right step of the pair, and the point (2k,0).
Hence, every pair (x,x′) with
(a) x ≥ 0 and even
(b) x′ − x ≥ 1 and odd

(c) x′ ≤ 2k and 2k − x′ − 1 even
is a potential pair of right steps ((x,0) → (x + 1,0), (x′,0) → (x′ + 1,0)) in a DDP
of length 2k.

We identify the DDPs of length 2k−1 with the subset of those DDPs of length 2k
for which the last step is a right step: (2k − 1,0) → (2k,0). In this manner, the right
steps in the DDPs of length 2k − 1 also come in pairs, but the second right step in
the last pair is always (2k − 1,0) → (2k,0).

For (x,x′) satisfying the conditions above, denote by Rx,x′ the total number
of pairs of right steps ((x,0) → (x + 1,0), (x′,0) → (x′ + 1,0)) in all DDPs of
length 2k, and by R−
x,x′ the total number of pairs of right steps ((x,0) → (x +
1,0), (x′,0) → (x′ + 1,0)) in all DDPs of length 2k ending in a right step (2k −
1,0) → (2k,0).

This completes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

The next lemma states that the total number of up steps (or down steps, since
the number of ups and downs has to be equal) in all DDPs of length 2k + 1 is twice
the total number of up steps in all DDPs of length 2k.

Lemma 4. For k ≥ 1, U (2k + 1) = 2U (2k).

Proof. Again we identify DDPs of length 2k with the subset of those DDPs of
length 2k + 1 whose last step is a right step (2k,0) → (2k + 1,0). Denote by U −
the total number of up steps in all DDPs of length 2k + 1 whose last step is a right
step (2k,0) → (2k + 1,0), and note that U − = U (2k). What remains to be shown
is that the total number of up steps in all those DDPs of length 2k + 1 whose last
step is a down step (2k,1) → (2k + 1,0) is equal to U (2k).

There are two types of up steps in the DDPs of length 2k:

(a) those which come from proper Dyck paths (DDPs which only contain up and

down steps); and

(b) those which come from DDPs which contain a right step.

4

Similarly, there are two types of down steps in those DDPs of length 2k + 1, whose
last step is a down step:
(c) the last down step (2k,1) → (2k + 1,0); and
(d) all the others.
As for (a), each of these paths contains exactly k up steps, so their total number
is k c(2k), where c(2k) := 1

k(cid:0) 2k
k−1(cid:1) is the kth Catalan number. Hence, their number
k−1(cid:1). As for (c), their number is coincides with the number of DDPs of length

2k + 1 ending in a down step, which equals the total number of DDPs of length
2k + 1 minus the number of DDPs of length 2k + 1 ending in a right step. The last
number is just the number of DDPs of length 2k, so, by invoking Lemma 2, we
obtain, for the down steps in (c),

is (cid:0) 2k

(cid:18)2k + 1

k (cid:19) −(cid:18)2k

k (cid:19) =(cid:18) 2k

k − 1(cid:19).

Thus, the numbers in (a) and (c) are equal.
As for (b) and (d), we deﬁne a bijection between the type-(d) down steps and the
type-(b) up steps.

For a DDP of length 2k + 1 whose last step is a down step (2k,1) → (2k + 1,0),
ﬁnd the greatest x for which (x,0) → (x + 1,1) is a step in the DDP. Then replace
the up step (x,0) → (x + 1,1) by a right step (x,0) → (x + 1,0), and delete the ﬁnal
(down) step. The resuls is a DDP of length 2k which as at least 1 right step. For the
inverse, for a DDP of length 2k which has at least 1 right step, take the greatest x
for which (x,0) → (x + 1,0) is a right step. Replace this right step by an up step
(x,0) → (x + 1,1), and add a tailing down step (2k,1) → (2k + 1,0), to obtain a
DDP of length 2k + 1.

It is easy to verify that this operation deﬁnes a bijection taking the down steps in
the longer DDPs onto the down steps in the 2k-DDPs, and hence between the sets
deﬁning (b) and (d).
(cid:3)

Combining the previous two lemmas, we obtain the following expression for the

total number of right steps:

Lemma 5. For n ≥ 1, we have

R(n) = 2n −(cid:18) n

⌊n/2⌋(cid:19)

(2)

Proof. The equation is readily veriﬁed for n = 1,2. We show that both R(·) and
RHS(·) satisfy the same recursive relation.

From Lemma 3, we know that R(2k + 1) = 2R(2k).
From previous lemma and the fact that

ndd(n) = R(n) +U (n) + D(n) = R(n) + 2U (n),

(∗)

we obtain

R(2k + 1) = (2k + 1)dd(2k + 1) − 2U (2k + 1)

= (2k + 1)dd(2k + 1) − 4U (2k)

= (2k + 1)dd(2k + 1) − 2(cid:2)2k dd(2k) − R(2k)(cid:3)
= 2R(2k) + (2k + 1)(cid:18)2k + 1

Using (k + 1)(cid:0)2k+1
equation RHS(2k + 1) = 2RHS(2k) + (2k + 1)(cid:0)2k+1

k (cid:1) = (2k + 1)(cid:0)2k

k(cid:1), we ﬁnd that the RHS of (2) satisﬁes the

(cid:3)

k (cid:1) − 4k(cid:0)2k

k(cid:1), too.

As the last ingredient, we prove that the total number of 1-ascents in all DDPs
of length n + 2 equals the number of DDPs of length n, plus the total number of
down steps in all DDPs of length n, plus the total number of right steps in all DDPs
of length n.

Lemma 6. For n ≥ 1

A(n + 2) = dd(n) + D(n) + R(n).

Proof. First of all, a 1-ascent can never be the last step in a DDP, since it has to end
on the x-axis and never goes below the x-axis. For the same reason, a 1-ascent can
never be followed by a right step, since we can only do right steps on the x-axis.
Hence, every 1-ascent has to be followed by a descent. Also, by the deﬁnition of a
1-ascent, it has to be preceded by either a descent, a right step, or the beginning of
the path. It is also clear that removing the 1-ascent with its following descent gives
us a valid DDP with length shorter by two.

Hence, we can pair each 1-ascent in a DDP with length n + 2 with either a
beginning, a descent, or a right step of a DDP with length n—the one that preceded
the 1-ascent in the DDP with length n + 2 before its removal.

Since adding an ascent-descent pair either in the beginning, after a descent of
after a right step in a DDP of length n always gives us a valid 1-ascent in a DDP of
length n + 2, we get that A(n + 2) = R(n) + D(n) + dd(n), as claimed.
(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 1. Here, we use the facts that dd(n) =(cid:0) n

We will use equation (∗) from the proof of Lemma 4 again. Using Lemma 6, we

⌊n/2⌋(cid:1), R(n) = 2n −(cid:0) n

We chose to present the proof which is based entirely on lattice path arguments.
There are several other statistics about dispersed Dyck paths which are of inter-
est in the ﬁeld. It should now be checked whether closed-form expressions can be
achieved for other ascent-related statistics, such as the total number of k-ascents,
for k > 1, or the number of dispersed Dyck paths of length n with t ascents of
length 1.
