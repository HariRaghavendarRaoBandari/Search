THE Qk FLOW ON COMPLETE NON-COMPACT GRAPHS

KYEONGSU CHOI AND PANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS

1. Introduction

We study in this work the long time existence of a family of complete non-compact strictly convex
hypersurfaces Σt embedded in Rn`1 which evolve by the Qk-ﬂow. Given a complete and convex hypersur-
face Σ0 embedded in Rn`1, we assume that F0 : Mn Ñ Rn`1 is an immersion with F0pMnq “ Σ0. We say
that the one-parameter family of immersions

F : Mn ˆ r0, Tq Ñ Rn`1

is a solution of the Qk-ﬂow p1 ď k ď nq, if FpMn, tq “ Σt are complete convex hypersurfaces for all
t P r0, Tq and Fp¨, tq satisﬁes

In [1], B. Andrews showed the existence of strictly convex closed solutions of a class of nonlinear ﬂow
which includes the Qk-ﬂow. S. Diater extended the results to closed convex solutions with the positive
S k´1 curvature in [7]. Moreover, Caputo, Daskalopoulos, and Sesum showed the existence of compact
convex C1,1 viscosity solutions with ﬂat sides in [3] and in [4]. Closed non-convex solutions of the Q2-
ﬂow in R3, the Harmonic mean curvature ﬂow, were considered by Daskalopoulos and Hamilton in [5]
and by Daskalopoulos, Hamilton and Sesum in [6].

The equation (˚n

k) is fully-nonlinear except from the case of k “ 1 which is the ﬂow by Mean curvature.
The evolution of entire graphs by the Mean curvature ﬂow was studied by Ecker and G. Huisken in [8, 9].
More recently, S´aez and Schn¨urer [10] showed the existence of complete solutions of the Mean curvature
ﬂow for an initial hypersurface which is a graph Σ0 “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ω0u over a bounded domain Ω0,
and u0pxq Ñ `8 as x Ñ BΩ0.

The Ecker and Huisken result in [9] shows that in some sense the Mean curvature ﬂow behaves better
than the heat equation on Rn, namely an entire graph solution exists for all time independently from the
growth of the initial surface at inﬁnity. The initial entire graph is assumed to be only locally Lipschitz.
This result is based on a local gradient estimate which is then combined with the evolution of the norm of
the second fundamental form |A|2 to give a local bound on |A|2, which is independent from the behavior
of the solution at spatial inﬁnity. The latter is achieved by adopting the well known technique of Caﬀarelli,
Nirenberg and Spruck in [2] in this geometric setting.

An open question between the experts in the ﬁeld is whether the techniques of Ecker and Huisken in
[8, 9] can be extended to the fully-nonlinear setting and in particular on complete convex graphs evolving
by the Qk-ﬂow . In this work we will show that this the case under the weak convexity assumption, as our
main result stated next shows.
Theorem 1.1. Let Σ0 “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ωu be a smooth weakly convex graph deﬁned by a function
u0 : Ω Ñ R on a convex open domain Ω Ă Rn such that
(i) u0 attains its minimum in Ω0, and infΩ0 u0 ě 0.
(ii) If Ω0 ‰ Rn, for all x0 P BΩ0, lim
u0pxq “ `8 holds.
xÑx0
lim|x|Ñ`8 u0pxq “ `8 holds.
(iii) If Ω0 is unbounded, then
(iv) Σ0 has the positive Qk curvature at all px, u0pxqq P Σ0.

Then, given a smooth immersion F0 of F0pMnq “ Σ0, there is a complete convex solution Σt of (˚n

k) for

T ě

Moreover, for each t P r0, Tq, Σt is a graph. In particular, if for all R ą 0 there exists a ball BRpxRq Ă Ω0 ,
then (˚n

k) has an all-time existing Σt solution.

Remark 1.2 (General initial data). Given a complete and strictly convex hypersurface Σn
0 embedded in
Rn`1, there exist an orthogonal matrix A P Opn ` 1q, a vector Y0 P Rn`1 and a function u0 : Ω Ñ R such
that AΣ0 ` Y0 (cid:66) tY0 ` AX : X P Σ0u “ tpx, u0pxqq : x P Ωu, and the conditions (i), (ii), (iii) above hold.
Thus, Theorem 1.1 shows the existence of a complete convex solution Σt of (˚n
k) for any complete smooth
strictly convex hypersurface Σ0.

Discussion of the proof of Theorem 1.1: The proof of Theorem 1.1 mainly relies on three a’priori local
estimates: the local gradient bound shown in Theorem 2.4, the local speed estimate given in Theorem 3.1
and a local bound from above on the second fundamental form |A|2 given in Theorem 4.2. The gradient
and the speed estimates use the well known technique by Caﬀarelli, Nirenberg and Spruck in [2] also used
by Esker and Huisken in the context of the Mean curvature ﬂow in [9]. Then, by using the concavity of the
Qkpλq function, we derive a local bound on |A|2 by modifying the elliptic estimate by W. Sheng, J. Urbas
and X.-J. Wang in [11] to the parabolic setting. We also establish derivative curvature estimates of any
order, by adopting the technique of Shi’s local derivative estimate to the setting of concave fully nonlinear
equations. The long time existence is shown by approximation with compact hypersurfaces and applying
the local a priori estimates.

Notation 1.3. We summarize the following notation, which will be frequently used in this paper.

(i) We recall the second fundamental form hi j – x∇i∇ jF, (cid:126)ny and the metric gi j – xFi, F jy, where
(ii) We denote by ¯u : Mn Ñ R the height function ¯upp, tq – xFpp, tq, (cid:126)en`1y. Also, given a constant

Fi – ∇iF.
M P R, we deﬁne a cut-oﬀ function ψ by

ψpp, tq – pM ´ ¯upp, tqq` “ maxpM ´ ¯u, 0q.

(iii) υ – x(cid:126)n, (cid:126)en`1y´1 denote the gradient function (as in [9]).
(iv) We denote by L the linearized operator,
L –

∇i∇ j.

BQkBhi j

In addition, x , yL denotes the inner product x∇ f,∇gyL “ BQkBhi j
tiable functions on Mn, and } ¨ }L denotes the L-norm given by the inner product x , yL.
(v) We recall the square sum of the principal curvatures |A|2 “ hi jhi j and the m-th order derivative

∇i f∇ jg, where f, g are diﬀeren-

of curvature

|∇mA|2 “ ∇i1 ¨¨¨∇imh jk∇i1 ¨¨¨∇imh jk.

(vi) For the principal curvatures tλ1,¨¨¨ , λnu, we denote by λmax the largest principal curvature

λmax – maxtλ1,¨¨¨ , λnu. Also, denote the following functions of the principal curvatures

In this section, we will review some properties of the symmetric function Qkpλq of λ, and we will derive
some basic evolution equations under the Qk-ﬂow. We will also establish a local gradient estimate and a
local lower bound on the speed, as straightforward consequence of the evolution equations.
Proposition 2.1. Assume that Σ is a convex smooth hypersurface in Rn`1 with the positive Qk curvature
and F : Mn Ñ Rn`1 is a smooth immersion satisfying FpMnq “ Σ. Let us choose an orthonormal frame

3. Speed estimate

In this section we will obtain a local upper bound on the speed Qk. We will use the gradient function υ
to localize our estimate in the spirit of the well known Caﬀarelli, Nirenberg, and Spruck estimate in [2]. A
similar technique was used by Ecker and Huisken [9] in the context of the Mean curvature ﬂow to obtain
a local bound on |A|2. Our proof is similar to that in [9].
Theorem 3.1 (Speed estimate). Assume Ω0 and Σ0 satisfy the assumptions in Theorem 1.1. Let Σt be a

In this ﬁnal section, we will establish the long time existence of the Qk-ﬂow (˚n

Theorem 1.1. Our proof will be based on the a’priori estimates in sections 2-5. Before we present the
proof of Theorem 1.1, we will introduce some extra notation and preliminary results.

Notation 6.1. We have:

(i) Given a set A P Rn`1, we denote by ConvpVq its convex hull ttx ` p1 ´ tqy : x, y P A, t P r0, 1su.
(ii) Let Σ be a convex complete (or closed) hypersurface. If a set V is a subset of ConvpΣq, we say V

is enclosed by Σ and use the notation

V ĺ Σ.

In particular, if V

pYq (cid:66) tX P Rn`1 : |X ´ Y| ă Ru denotes the pn` 1q-ball of radius R centered at Y P Rn`1.

where d is the distance function.

(v) For a convex closed hypersurface Σ, we deﬁne the support function S : S n Ñ R by

Spvq “ max
YPΣ

(vi) For a convex C2 hypersurface Σ and a point X P Σ, we denote by λminpΣqpXq the smallest principal

Since we will approximate the initial hypersurface Σ0 by its envelopes pΣ0qη, which are of class C1,1,

in order to regularized them, we introduce the convolution on the sphere.
Proposition 6.2 (Convolution on S n). For  P p0, 1q, let ϕ : S nˆS n Ñ R be a smooth function satisfying

Assume that f is of class CmpUq on an open subset U Ă S n, then f ˚ ϕ uniformly converge to f in CmpKq
on any compact subset K of U.
Proof. The proof is standard but we include it here for completeness. Since  P p0, 1q, for each v P S n,
the support of ϕpv,¨q is compactly embedded in the hemisphere centered at v. We choose a rotation

Let ϕ be as in Proposition 6.2 and let Σ be a strictly convex closed hypersurface. We will next show
how to regularize Σ by convolving the support function of its η-envelope Ση (which is a C1,1 hypersurface)
with the function ϕ. This is a standard argument which we include here for the reader’s convenience.

Proposition 6.3. Let Ση denote the η-envelope of a convex closed hypersurface Σ with a uniform lower

Proof. Let ¯gi j denote the standard metric on S n and let ¯∇ be the connection on S n deﬁned by ¯gi j. Notice
that for a function f : S n Ñ R`, if ¯∇i ¯∇ j f ` f ¯gi j is a positive deﬁnite matrix with respect to the metric
¯gi j, then f is the support function of a strictly convex hypersurface, and the eigenvalues of ¯∇i ¯∇ j f ` f ¯gi j
are the principal radii of curvature of the hypersurface (c.f. [12]).
Since Ση is a uniformly convex hypersurface of class C1,1, its support function S is of class C1,1pS nq,
namely ¯∇ ¯∇ exists almost everywhere. In addition, since the principal radii of curvature of the η-envelope
are bounded from below by η, we have
