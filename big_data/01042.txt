ABSTRACT
We analyse photometry for 138 ﬁrst overtone Cepheids from the Small Magellanic
Cloud, in which Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) team discovered
additional variability with period shorter than ﬁrst overtone period, and period ratios
in the P/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65) range. In the Petersen diagram these stars form three
well separated sequences. The additional variability cannot correspond to other radial
mode. This form of pulsation is still puzzling.

We ﬁnd that amplitude of the additional variability is small, typically 2–4 per
cent of the ﬁrst overtone amplitude, which corresponds to 2–5 mmag. In some stars
we ﬁnd simultaneously two close periodicities corresponding to two sequences in the
Petersen diagram. The most important ﬁnding is the detection of power excess at
half the frequency of the additional variability (at subharmonic) in 35 per cent of
the analysed stars. Interestingly, power excess at subharmonic frequency is detected
mostly for stars of the middle sequence in the Petersen diagram (74 per cent), incidence
rate is much lower for stars of the top sequence (31 per cent), and phenomenon is
not detected for stars of the bottom sequence. The amplitude and/or phase of the
additional periodicities strongly vary in time.

Similar form of pulsation is observed in ﬁrst overtone RR Lyrae stars. Our results
indicate that the nature and cause of this form of pulsation is the same in the two
groups of classical pulsators; consequently, a common model explaining this form of
pulsation should be searched for. Our results favour the theory of the excitation of
non-radial modes of angular degrees 7, 8 and 9, proposed recently by Dziembowski.

INTRODUCTION

The majority of classical Cepheids are single-periodic, ra-
dial pulsators. More complex pulsation is not rare, how-
ever. Double-mode Cepheids pulsating simultaneously in
the radial
fundamental and in the radial ﬁrst overtone
modes (F+1O) and in the two lowest-order radial overtones
(1O+2O) are known for years. These form of pulsation is
recognized based on characteristic period ratios of the ex-
cited pulsation modes, P2O/P1O ≈ 0.80 − 0.81 for 1O+2O
pulsators and P1O/PF ≈ 0.715 − 0.74 for F+1O pulsators
(e.g. Soszy´nski et al. 2008b, 2010). A well known fact is that
period ratio depends on metallicity; characteristic values
may slightly diﬀer for stars from diﬀerent stellar systems.

observations led to the discovery of other forms of multi-
periodic pulsation among Cepheids. Triple-mode radial
pulsation, F+1O+2O and 1O+2O+3O, was
identiﬁed
(Moskalik, Ko laczkowski & Mizerski 2004; Soszy´nski et al.
2008a, 2010, 2011, 2015). A very interesting triple-mode
Cepheid, with 1O, 2O and additional longer-period mode,
was discovered with CoRoT (Poretti, Baglin & Weiss 2014).
Rare and peculiar double-mode pulsations were also discov-
ered, including 1O+3O pulsation with 2O apparently not
excited (Soszy´nski et al. 2008a, 2015) and ﬁrst double-mode
2O+3O Cepheid (Soszy´nski et al. 2015). For recent review
see Moskalik (2014).

The analysis of 1O Cepheids revealed another, most
interesting group of double-periodic pulsators. In more
than hundred 1O Cepheids additional small-amplitude vari-
ability, with period shorter than ﬁrst overtone period,

2

was detected. The period ratios fall
in the P/P1O ∈
(0.6, 0.65) range and cannot correspond to two radial modes
(Dziembowski & Smolec 2009). 35 stars were reported in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, Moskalik & Ko laczkowski
2009; Soszy´nski et al. 2008b), 138 stars in the Small Mag-
ellanic Cloud (SMC, Soszy´nski et al. 2010) and 1 star was
found in the Galactic disc (Pietrukowicz et al. 2013). One
LMC star with additional variability pulsates simultane-
ously in the radial fundamental and ﬁrst overtone modes
(Moskalik & Ko laczkowski 2009). Two stars were also iden-
tiﬁed in the Kepler-K2 photometry (Plachy et al., in prep.).
In the Petersen diagram, i.e. in the plot of shorter-to-longer
period ratio versus the longer period, these stars group in
the three well separated sequences.

Interestingly, very similar form of pulsation is present
in RR Lyrae stars, see the most in-depth and exten-
sive studies of the phenomenon by Moskalik et al. (2015),
Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015a,b) and Jurcsik et al.
(2015). Additional variability is detected in ﬁrst overtone
pulsators (RRc) or in double-mode F+1O pulsators (RRd).
Period ratios fall in the similar range, P/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.64).
Three sequences are present in the Petersen diagram as well,
although they are not that well separated as in the case
of Cepheids (Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik 2015b). Thanks
to ultra-precise observations by space telescopes, Kepler
and CoRoT (e.g. Szab´o et al. 2014; Moskalik et al. 2015;
Moln´ar et al. 2015; Kurtz et al. 2016), and detailed analysis
of ground-based observations (Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik
2015a,b; Jurcsik et al. 2015) this form of pulsation is well
studied in RR Lyr stars. In particular, we know that in
the frequency spectra of these stars signal (power excess)
at subharmonic of the additional frequency is present. Sig-
nals associated with the additional variability are broad and
non-coherent. In the time domain it corresponds to strong
variability of amplitude and frequency on a time-scale of a
few tens to hundred of days. The phenomenon must be com-
mon among RRc/RRd stars, as 14 out of 15 stars observed
from space show this form of pulsation (for a summary see
Moskalik et al. 2015).

In contrast to RR Lyr stars, 1O Cepheids were not
extensively observed from space (see Sect. 4.1). Analysis
of ground-based data,
in particular of the largest sam-
ple of 138 of these interesting stars from SMC is missing.
Soszy´nski et al. (2010) only reported the discovery of these
stars and provided their periods and period ratios. In the
present study we analyse the OGLE-III data for these in-
teresting objects in detail. We do not search for additional
objects, but focus on those in which we know that additional
variability is present. Our goal is to study the properties of
the variability in detail. In particular, we check for the pres-
ence of subharmonics of the additional signal, analyse the
amplitude distribution and time-variation of the additional
signals. These are necessary information for the models and
theories to explain this peculiar and puzzling form of pulsa-
tion.

2 DATA ANALYSIS

We analyse OGLE-III I-band photometry for 138 stars listed
in Soszy´nski et al. (2010). All these stars were identiﬁed as
1O Cepheids with additional small amplitude variability,

with period ratios in the P/P1O ∈ (0.6, 0.65) range. We use
standard consecutive pre-whitening technique. We identify
the dominant frequencies with the help of discrete Fourier
transform (FT). Next, we ﬁt the data with the sine series of
the following form:

m(t) = m0 + X

k

Ak sin(2πνkt + φk) ,

(1)

using the non-linear least-square ﬁtting. The FT of residual
data is inspected for the presence of additional signals, which
are iteratively included in eq. (1). Only resolved frequencies
are included. We consider two peaks as well resolved if their
separation is larger than 2/∆T , where ∆T is data length. In
the FT the signal is considered signiﬁcant if signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N ) exceeds 4. The criterion is relaxed for signals
at combination frequencies, provided that peak is present
exactly (within frequency resolution) at the expected po-
sition (we accept S/N > 3.5). Typically our solution con-
sists of low-order (3 − 6) Fourier series describing the dom-
inant variability associated with the ﬁrst overtone (kν1O),
sine term with the frequency of the additional variability of
interest (νx) and possibly with the combination frequency
with the ﬁrst overtone frequency (typically ν1O + νx). Ad-
ditional signiﬁcant signals we ﬁnd, that do not fall in the
P/P1O ∈ (0.6, 0.65) range, are also included in eq. (1).

During the analysis we reject the outliers (4σ criterion)
and remove slow trends through subtracting from the orig-
inal data the low-order polynomials or splines. These func-
tions are ﬁtted to the residuals. Quite often, after prewhiten-
ing with the ﬁrst overtone frequency and its harmonics,
residual signal remains at the location unresolved with kν1O.
Typically it corresponds to the long-term variation of the
ﬁrst overtone phase (period change). This signal may be sig-
niﬁcant which increases the noise level in the FT and conse-
quently may hide the additional variabilities. In such case we
get rid of the non-stationary ﬁrst overtone variation with the
help of time-dependent prewhitening technique, described
and applied to the Kepler data by Moskalik et al. (2015).
Application to the ground-based OGLE data is described in
more detail in Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015a).

Strong daily aliases and 1-yr aliases are inherent to
ground-based OGLE observations of the SMC. As the sig-
nals we search for are relatively weak, the alias-related am-
biguities can happen. In some stars, after prewhitening with
the ﬁrst overtone frequency, we detect a few signiﬁcant peaks
of similar height which are mutual daily aliases. If period cor-
responding to one of them falls in the P/P1O ∈ (0.6, 0.65)
range, then this peak is accepted as a true signal, even if it is
not the highest peak. All such cases are reported explicitly
in the study.

and remarks. The resulting Petersen diagram is plotted in
Fig. 1.

In the frequency spectrum, the additional variability
rarely appears as a single and coherent peak. Typically more
complex structures are present; examples are illustrated in
Fig. 2. Sometimes two dominant close peaks are detected,
as illustrated in the top two panels of Fig. 2. In other cases
the signal appears as a complex cluster of peaks, as illus-
trated in the two lower panels of Fig. 2. In our analysis we
pick the highest peak in the cluster, or in a group of close
peaks (marked with ﬁlled diamonds in Fig. 2), and include
its frequency in eq. (1). Its properties, period and amplitude,
Px and Ax, are then given in Tab. 1. After prewhitening,
residual, unresolved power is often detected. Such appear-
ance of additional variability indicates that it is strongly
non-stationary, with variable phase and/or amplitude (see
Section 3.6). All stars in which more complex structures are
detected at νx (two close peaks, clusters of peaks, resid-
ual power after prewhitening) are marked with ‘nsx’ in the
remarks column of Tab. 1. These structures indicate that

additional variability is non-stationary, see Sect. 3.6. The
diﬀerent appearance of the signal may result from diﬀerent
time-scales of the variability and diﬀerent structure of the
data (diﬀerent length of the available data). There are 80
stars marked with ‘nsx’ which is 58 per cent of the analysed
sample. The complex structures at νx are common.

Smolec & ´Sniegowska

First overtone is often non-stationary as well, which ap-
pears as strong unresolved power at its frequency, after the
prewhitening. These stars are marked with ‘nsO’ in Tab. 1.
There are 56 such stars which constitutes nearly 41 per cent
of the analysed sample. In some cases the unresolved power
at ν1O dominates the frequency spectrum and signiﬁcantly
increases the noise level in the Fourier transform, which may
hide the additional signiﬁcant peaks. In all such cases we
conducted time-dependent prewhitening to get rid of the
unwanted signal. If time-dependent prewhitening was cru-
cial for the detection of additional variability of interest, or
signiﬁcantly improved the S/N of the interesting peak at
νx, then ‘tdp’ is included in the remarks column of Tab. 1.
In these cases the frequency and amplitude of the addi-
tional variability are determined independently of the deter-
mination of amplitude and frequency of the ﬁrst overtone,
from the dataset with ﬁrst overtone ﬁltered out. An inherent
part of the time-dependent prewhitening is time-dependent
Fourier analysis, which shows how the amplitude and phase
of the ﬁrst overtone change in time. In the majority of cases
we observed a pronounced phase change, while amplitude
changes were insigniﬁcant. No ﬁrm case of Blazhko-like mod-
ulation was found, although in some cases variation of ﬁrst
overtone phase seemed periodic.

Fast period changes, on time-scale shorter than ex-
pected from evolutionary calculations are common in
1O Cepheids. Exemplary O-C diagrams may be found
e.g.
in studies by Berdnikov & Pastukhova (1994) or
Berdnikov et al. (1997). A detailed study of OGLE and
MACH data for LMC Cepheids was conducted by Poleski
(2008) who detected period changes in 41 per cent of 1O
LMC Cepheids and in 18 per cent of fundamental mode
pulsators. The analysis of period changes of the ﬁrst over-
tone is beyond the scope of the present analysis, however;
dedicated study is planned.

In 25 stars we ﬁnd peaks at combination frequency,
ν1O + νx, and in one star we ﬁnd peak at νx − ν1O (OGLE-
SMC-CEP-0797). These stars are marked with ‘cf’ in the
last column of Tab. 1.

Stars in which signal at a daily alias of νx is higher are
marked with ‘al’. As described in the previous section, we
select the lower alias as a true signal if it falls well within
one of the three sequences in the Petersen diagram.

In 17 stars marked with ‘ap’ in Tab. 1 we detect ad-
ditional signiﬁcant periodicity that does not fall into the
P/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65) range and cannot be interpreted as
due to other radial mode. In a few stars the additional
peaks appear relatively close to the radial ﬁrst overtone
frequency. We note that similar detections were reported
by Moskalik & Ko laczkowski (2009), who argue that these
signals may be intrinsic to the stars and correspond to non-
radial pulsation. In no case we detect combination frequency
with the ﬁrst overtone, however. In principle these periodic-
ities may result from blending. We postpone the discussion
of these additional signals till the analysis of full sample of
SMC Cepheids, which will allow to draw some statistically
meaningful conclusions concerning their nature.

In stars plotted with triangle in Fig. 1 the detection of
additional variability is weak. These stars are marked with
‘?’ and S/N value is given in the last column of Tab. 1.
In some cases the additional signal appeared only after the
time-dependent prewhitening. There are eight such cases

and we discuss them in more detail in the Appendix, in
Sect. B, which also contains detailed comparison of our re-
sults with those reported in Soszy´nski et al. (2010). The pe-
riod ratios for these stars fall well within the three sequences
in the Petersen diagram. Despite the weak detection, we con-
sider these stars as double-periodic in the following.

In six stars, two well separated and signiﬁcant peaks
were detected in the frequency range of interest – the cor-
responding period ratios fall within two separate sequences
in Fig. 1. In the ﬁgure these stars are marked with squares,
two for each of six stars. Their frequency spectra are plot-
ted in Fig. 3. Typically, signal corresponding to one of the
sequences is dominant, while the detection of peak corre-
sponding to the other sequence is rather weak (but always
with S/N > 4.0). In Tab. 1, two rows are present for these
stars, with characteristics of the highest peaks falling within
one of the sequences. All other stars, in which we detect
a signiﬁcant peak corresponding to only one sequence, are
marked with circles in Fig. 1.

Finally, in many stars we detect signiﬁcant power cen-
tred at 1/2νx, i.e. at subharmonic frequency. These stars are
marked with ‘sh’ in the remarks column of Tab. 1, printed
in italics if the detection is weak. In the Petersen diagram in
Fig. 1, stars with ﬁrm detection of the power excess at sub-
harmonic frequency are marked with ﬁlled symbols. In the
case of weak detection half-ﬁlled symbol is plotted. These
signals will be discussed in detail in Section 3.4.

3.2 The Petersen diagram and amplitude

distributions

Three well separated and slanted sequences are present in
the Petersen diagram (Fig. 1). 64 stars fall within the bot-
tom sequence, 54 stars fall within the middle sequence and
26 stars fall within the top sequence. The numbers do not
add up to 138, as six stars fall within two sequences simul-
taneously. Within each sequence period ratio drops with the
increasing pulsation period. Stars forming the bottom se-
quence have, on average, shorter pulsation periods, while
stars forming the top sequence have, on average, longer pul-
sation periods.

The number of stars in the top sequence is signiﬁcantly
smaller than in the middle and bottom sequences. On the
other hand, long-period ﬁrst overtone Cepheids are not as
numerous as short-period overtone pulsators. In Fig. 4, we
study the period distribution for all 1644 ﬁrst overtone SMC
Cepheids from OGLE-III collection (solid black line) and
for stars with additional variability (hatched area; three
diﬀerent patterns show the contributions from the three
sequences). Stars were counted in 0.5 d-wide bins, except
P1O < 1 d, where we used smaller, 0.25 d-wide bins. This is
because of sharp increase of Cepheid number as one moves
from 0.25-0.5 d bin through 0.5-0.75 d bin to 0.75-1.0 d bin.
Within each bin the incidence rate of stars with additional
variability is given with statistical errors calculated assum-
ing that the population follows a Poisson distribution (e.g.
Alcock et al. 2003).

It is well visible that the discussed form of pulsation
is not present in the shortest period 1O Cepheids with
P1O < 0.75d, despite of 151 stars falling into this period
range. For 0.75d < P1O < 1.0d there are 342 1O Cepheids
and only in ﬁve of them the additional variability was found.

Figure 3. Frequency spectra for six stars in which two signiﬁ-
cant peaks, corresponding to two sequences in the Petersen dia-
gram, were detected. These peaks are marked with ﬁlled diamonds
placed at the S/N = 4.0 level. The extent of the horizontal bar,
plotted in each panel, corresponds to separation expected for 1-yr
aliases. Period-ratio scale, P/P1O, is plotted at the top of each
panel, with numerical labels plotted in the top-most panel.

Incidence rate is very low (1.5 ± 0.7 per cent) as compared
to the next longer-period bin (10.8 ± 1.4 per cent). This is
most likely due to selection eﬀect. Shortest period overtone
Cepheids are least luminous (because of the P − L relation,
see Fig. 7), consequently one may expect higher noise level
in the Fourier transform, which may hinder the detection of
low-amplitude variability. This is discussed in more detail
in Sect. 3.5. For P1O > 1d the discussed form of pulsation
is quite frequent. For 1d 6 P1O < 2d the incidence rate is

Figure 4. Period distribution for all 1O SMC OGLE-III Cepheids
(solid black line) and for stars with the additional variability
(hatched area). Contributions from the three sequences in the Pe-
tersen diagram are marked with diﬀerent patterns, as indicated
in the key. Incidence rates are also provided.

for 3d 6 P1O < 4d it is ≈ 8 per cent. Taking into account
the statistical errors, these numbers are not that diﬀerent.
We conclude that the top sequence is the least numerous
of the three, mostly because there are fewer long-period 1O
Cepheids than short-period ones and also because the inci-
dence rate may be slightly lower for longer periods.

The additional variability is always weak as compared
to radial ﬁrst overtone. Tab. 1 provides the amplitude of
the ﬁrst overtone, A1O, and amplitude ratio, Ax/A1O. The
top panel of Fig. 5 shows the amplitude of the ﬁrst over-
tone as a function of the ﬁrst overtone period. The am-
plitude drops with increasing pulsation period. The high-
est (Fourier) amplitude is slightly below 0.2 mag, the low-
est is around 0.06 mag. The most typical values fall in the
0.10 − 0.16 mag range. In the middle panel of Fig. 5 we plot
the amplitude of the ﬁrst overtone as a function of period
ratio, Px/P1O. The trace of the three sequences present in
the Petersen diagram is well visible. It is clear that ampli-
tudes are the highest in stars forming the bottom sequence
(as these stars have shorter ﬁrst overtone periods, on aver-
age) and the lowest in the stars forming the top sequence
(stars with longer ﬁrst overtone periods). The bottom panel
of Fig. 5 shows the amplitude ratio, Ax/A1O, as a function
of period ratio. There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the stars corresponding to the three sequences. In stars that
are plotted with ﬁlled symbols in Fig. 5, a power excess at
subharmonic, 1/2νx, is detected. This will be discussed in
more detail in Sect. 3.4. Here we just note that for stars
of the middle and top sequences (only there power excess
at subharmonic was detected) there is no diﬀerence in ﬁrst
overtone amplitude between stars with, and stars without
power excess at subharmonic. The histogram of amplitude
ratios, Ax/A1O, for all the stars is presented in Fig. 6. The
distribution peaks at Ax/A1O ≈ 1.75−2.25 per cent. Typical
amplitudes of the additional variability are in the 2–5 mmag
range (see also Fig. 12). It explains why the additional vari-
ability was discovered only recently – high-quality observa-
tions are necessary to detect such low-amplitude variabil-
ity. So far, the signal was detected mostly in the excellent

(bottom panel) diagrams for all 1O Cepheids from the SMC
OGLE-III collection (small dots) and for Cepheids with additional
variability analysed in this paper (larger symbols; red circles cor-
respond to the bottom sequence in the Petersen diagram, green
diamonds to the middle sequence and blue squares to the top se-
quence). In addition, double-mode, F+1O Cepheids are plotted
with small squares.

3.3 Comparison with other ﬁrst overtone

Cepheids without additional variability

In this Section, we check whether Cepheids with additional
variability diﬀer signiﬁcantly from other ﬁrst overtone SMC
Cepheids, that are single-periodic. In Fig. 7, we plot the lo-
cation of analysed stars in the period-luminosity (top panel)
and in the colour-magnitude (bottom panel) diagrams. For
the former diagram we use reddening free Wesenheit index as
the luminosity indicator. In the plots, all 1O Cepheids are
plotted with small black dots, while stars with additional
variability are plotted with larger symbols; point shape and
point colour code the star’s location in the Petersen diagram
(red circles – bottom sequence, green diamonds – middle
sequence and blue squares – top sequence). Stars in which
variability corresponding to two sequences was detected, are
plotted only once, as members of the sequence for which cor-
responding amplitude is higher. For this plot, periods and in-
tensity mean I- and V -band magnitudes were taken directly
from the OGLE-III ftp archive (Soszy´nski et al. 2010).

Except the lack of additional variability in the shortest
period stars (P1O < 0.8 d), which we already noted in the
previous Section, we see no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the dis-
tribution of stars with and without the additional variability
in the two diagrams presented in Fig. 7. They cover simi-
lar colour and Wesenheit index ranges. Separation of stars,
members of the three sequences in the Petersen diagram, is
clear and pronounced. As period-luminosity diagram indi-

cates, it results from diﬀerent ﬁrst overtone periods char-
acteristic for the three groups. Members of the bottom se-
quence have shorter periods and consequently are least lumi-
nous, while members of the top sequence have longer periods
and are thus most luminous. For stars of each sequence the
covered colour range is similar as for single-periodic stars of
similar luminosity. In Fig. 7, we also plotted double-mode
F+1O Cepheids (small squares). These stars cover similar
luminosity range as stars of the bottom sequence, but are
shifted, on average, towards higher colour values.

In Fig. 8, we compare the light curve shapes with the
help of the Fourier decomposition parameters (Simon & Lee

1981). Symbols used in the panels are exactly the same as
in Fig. 7. In the consecutive panels, from top to bottom,
we plot: peak-to-peak amplitude, R21, R31, ϕ21 and ϕ31, all
as a function of ﬁrst overtone period. A lack of short pe-
riod Cepheids with additional variability is again apparent.
Also, additional variability is not detected in stars with low
ﬁrst overtone amplitude, A . 0.2 mag (and consequently in
stars with lower R21 and R31), which is a selection eﬀect.
First, these stars are not as numerous as higher amplitude
Cepheids. Second, with typical amplitude of the additional
variability corresponding to ∼ 2 − 4 per cent of the ﬁrst
overtone amplitude, possible signals are also of lower am-
plitude and likely hidden in the noise. Otherwise, it seems
that Cepheids with additional variability follow the same
progressions as Cepheids without additional variability. The
only exception seems the behaviour of ϕ21 in the narrow
period range of 1.4 − 1.6 d. In this period bin, 1O Cepheids
cover the 4 . ϕ21 . 5 range, but stars with additional vari-
ability and of the bottom sequence (red circles) prefer the
low values, ϕ21 . 4.3.

We conclude that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween 1O Cepheids with and without the additional variabil-
ity, with regards to their location on the period-luminosity
and colour-magnitude diagrams, and light curve shapes
(with the possible exception of ϕ21 in relatively narrow pe-
riod range).

3.4 Subharmonics

In many stars we detect signiﬁcant signal centred at 1/2νx,
i.e. at subharmonic of νx. Typically the signal detected at
1/2νx has a complex form – broad cluster of peaks, centred
at 1/2νx is detected. Stars in which such power excess was
detected are marked with ‘sh’ in Tab. 1. The weak detection
is marked with ‘sh’. What we regard as ‘weak’ is somewhat
subjective. In general, if 3.5 < S/N < 4.0 for the highest
peak at around 1/2νx, or the power excess was evident only
after the time-dependent prewhitening, the star is marked
as a weak detection. In all cases however, the power excess
was clear. Altogether, it was detected in 48 stars, of which
14 are marked as weak detections. This constitutes 35 per
cent of the analysed sample or, if weak detections are ex-
cluded, 25 per cent. Detailed characterization of frequency
spectra of stars with power excess detected at subharmonic
frequency is collected in Tab. 2. Power excess is character-
ized by the frequency and amplitude of the highest peak de-
tected at around 1/2νx, νsh and Ash, respectively. Table con-
tains: star’s id, period ratio, Px/P1O, frequency of the addi-
tional variability, νx, frequency of the highest peak detected
around 1/2νx, νsh, amplitude of the additional variability,
Ax, and amplitude ratio, Ash/Ax, approximate S/N for the
peak at νsh and remarks: ‘weak’ – weak detection, ‘broad’ –
broad power excess; ‘tdp’ – time-dependent prewhitening of
all signals except νsh conducted.

No ﬁrm detection of power excess at other subharmonic
frequencies, i.e. at 3/2νx, 5/2νx, etc., is reported. There are
a few ambiguous cases, in which power excess is present at
3/2νx, but sometimes it is an alias of power excess at 1/2νx
or of unresolved residual power at ﬁrst overtone frequency.
Time-dependent prewhitening will not help here; by remov-
ing e.g. the non-stationary variation at ν1O we also remove
the power at its daily aliases.

Before we discuss the properties of the signals detected
at subharmonic frequencies, in Figs. 9, 10 and 11 we show
some examples of structures detected in the frequency spec-
tra of the stars at νx and at 1/2νx. In Fig. 9, we show the
cases in which signal at 1/2νx is ﬁrmly detected and is rela-
tively narrow. In Fig. 10, we show some of the cases in which
the signal at 1/2νx is broad. Finally, in Fig. 11, we show
some cases in which detection of the power excess is weak.
Structure of these three ﬁgures is the same. For each star
two panels are plotted. In the top panel the frequency spec-

trum centred at νx is plotted, while in the bottom panel the
frequency spectrum centred at 1/2νx is plotted. The plotted
frequency range is the same in the two panels; it is wider
in Figs. 10 and 11 for better visualization of the signal at
1/2νx.

Based on the content of Tab. 2 and on Figs. 9, 10 and
11, we now discuss the properties of the signal detected at
1/2νx. We ﬁrst note that the detected power excess is in-
deed well centred at 1/2νx. The mean value of νsh/νx for all
the stars is 0.5003 ± 0.0010; values of νsh/νx < 0.5 are as

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–19

10

common as νsh/νx > 0.5. The values of |νsh/νx − 0.5| (see
Tab. 2) never exceed 0.02. The largest deviations are present
for stars in which broad power excess at subharmonic is ob-
served, like in those plotted in Fig. 10 (OGLE-SMC-CEP-
1856, -4255). Still, there is no doubt that the power excess
is centred at 1/2νx (only the highest peak within the power
excess is located a bit oﬀ).

Stars that do show power excess at 1/2νx are not uni-
formly distributed in the Petersen diagram. In Fig. 1, stars
which show ﬁrm power excess at 1/2νx are plotted with ﬁlled
symbols, while for stars in which the detection of power ex-
cess is weak are marked with half-ﬁlled symbols. Majority of
the 48 stars with power excess at 1/2νx fall within the mid-
dle sequence (40 stars, including 8 weak cases), a few stars
fall within the top sequence (8 stars including 6 weak cases)
and none falls within the bottom sequence. Thus 74 per cent
of stars from the middle sequence and 31 per cent of the stars
from the top sequence show the power excess at 1/2νx. If we
exclude the weak detections, the numbers are 59 and 8 per
cent, respectively. We conclude that the occurrence of power
excess at 1/2νx is strongly correlated with the location of
star on the Petersen diagram. The power excess is detected
in the majority of stars from the middle sequence, in signif-
icantly smaller fraction of stars from the top sequence and
in no star from the bottom sequence.

The amplitude of the signal at νsh is always in the mmag
range and is comparable to the amplitude of the signal at νx.
This is investigated in more detail in Fig. 12, in which in the
top panel we plot the histogram of amplitude ratio, Ash/Ax,
and in the bottom panel we plot Ash versus Ax. The dis-
tribution of amplitude ratios is wide, without a pronounced
peak. It is truncated at Ash/Ax ≈ 0.5, which is not sur-
prising. As the signals at νx are weak, detected with typical
S/N ≈ 4 − 6, we cannot detect the signals with amplitudes
signiﬁcantly lower, below ≈ 0.5Ax – these are hidden in the
noise. We note eight cases in which peak at νsh is higher
than the peak detected at νx. We may safely conclude that
amplitudes, Ax and Ash, are comparable. This is further il-
lustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 12, in which Ash is
plotted versus Ax. Green diamonds correspond to stars lo-
cated within the middle sequence in the Petersen diagram,
while blue squares correspond to stars located within the
top sequence. The amplitudes are (weakly) correlated; the
higher the Ax, the higher the Ash. Amplitudes in stars from
the top sequence are in general smaller (see also Sect. 3.5).

3.5 Possible impact of observational selection

eﬀects on incidence rates

The period distribution of stars with additional variability,
and the incidence rate of power excess at subharmonic fre-
quency within each sequence, may be aﬀected by observa-
tional selection eﬀects. The most important selection eﬀect
is related to star’s luminosity. On the short-period end, the
Cepheids are least luminous (Fig. 7). Therefore, we expect
larger noise level in the Fourier transform. As a consequence,
low-amplitude variability may be hidden in the noise, which
could explain the lack of additional variability at νx in the
shortest period ﬁrst overtone stars or lack of subharmonics
in stars of the bottom sequence in the Petersen diagram. On
long-period end, the stars are more luminous and the noise
level should be lower.

and plot of Ash versus Ax (bottom panel).

To quantify the impact of noise on the detection of
low-amplitude variability, we ﬁrst estimate the noise level
in the Fourier transform as a function of pulsation period.
To this aim, we analysed the data for all SMC OGLE-III
1O Cepheids in the following, homogeneous way. Using the
time-dependent prewhitening on a season-to-season basis we
removed from the data (possibly non-stationary) variability
associated with the ﬁrst overtone (sixth order Fourier se-
ries). This technique also removes trends possibly present in
the data. Possible signals at νx and at 1/2νx remain in the
data but, as these signals are of low amplitude and present
in less than 10 per cent of all 1O Cepheids, they should not
alter our estimate signiﬁcantly. Then, in the frequency spec-
trum of residual data for each star, we computed the av-
erage noise level in the frequency range (0, 3ν1O). The re-
sulting data, noise versus ﬁrst overtone period, were ﬁtted
with spline function. This function, multiplied by 4, is plot-
ted with dashed line in Fig. 13 and represents the estimate
of the detection threshold as a function of the ﬁrst overtone
period.

In the top panel of Fig. 13, we consider the inﬂuence
of selection eﬀects on the detection of additional variability
at νx. Diﬀerent symbols represent the data for the three se-
quences. As noted in Sect. 3.2 (see also Fig. 4) the discussed
form of pulsation is not present for P1O < 0.75d and is very
scarce in the 0.75d < P1O < 1d range in which 1O Cepheids
are very numerous. The question we can answer is, whether
the sharp decrease of the incidence rate at shorter periods
can be explained by observational selection, assuming that
the amplitude distribution of signals at νx is similar as is
observed for longer periods.

For the shortest periods, P1O < 0.75d, it is clear from
Fig. 13 that the noise level is very high. It strongly depends

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–19

on pulsation period, but already at P1O = 0.75d detection of
signals with amplitudes below 4.5 mmag might be diﬃcult
and situation worsens fast as period is decreased further.
Thus, the lack of additional variability for the P1O < 0.75d
range may be entirely due to selection eﬀects.

In the 0.75d < P1O < 1d range the situation is more dif-
ﬁcult. We note that for longer periods we can detect signals
with amplitudes above ∼ 2 mmag. Thus, the very low num-
ber of stars with additional variability located within box
A in Fig. 13, which is due to high noise level, may be re-
sponsible for the small incidence rate in the discussed period
range as compared to longer periods. How many detections
may we miss in this box? As an estimate, we can count the
stars within the same area, but at longer periods, for exam-
ple within boxes marked B or C in Fig. 13. There are 21
stars within box B and 15 stars within box C. These num-
bers are scaled by NA/NB or NA/NC factor, where NX is
the total number of 1O Cepheids within period range corre-
sponding to a given box. Using these numbers to estimate
the incidence rate within the 0.75d < P1O < 1d range we get
11.1 ± 1.7 per cent or 14.6 ± 1.9 per cent, using data from
box B or C, respectively. We conclude that sharp decrease
of the incidence rate at P1O < 1d may be entirely explained
by observational selection.

For the period range characteristic for the middle and
top sequences in the Petersen diagram, the noise level is
roughly the same, it slowly decreases with increasing period.
Thus, a small decrease of the incidence rate of the discussed
form of pulsation, with pulsation period, noted in Sect. 3.2,
is likely real and not a result of observational selection.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 13, we consider the inﬂu-
ence of observational selection on the incidence rate of power
excess at 1/2νx within the three sequences. Symbols corre-
spond to observational data. We ﬁrst note that amplitudes
of signals in stars of the top sequence are, on average, lower
than amplitudes of signals in stars of the middle sequence.
Also, the incidence rate of power excess at subharmonic is
signiﬁcantly lower for the top sequence. This is obviously not
due to diﬀerent noise levels; signals of the amplitude char-
acteristic for the middle sequence should be easily detected
at longer periods. The possible explanation is that ampli-
tudes of the signals at 1/2νx in stars of the top sequence
are lower than in stars of the middle sequence. Situation
is similar for the stars of the bottom sequence. Although
the noise level increases with the decreasing period, the in-
crease is pronounced only for P1O . 1d. Amplitudes as high
as in the middle sequence should be detected, but they are
not. Thus, the amplitudes of signals at 1/2νx in stars of the
bottom sequence must be lower than in stars of the middle
sequence. In fact, to remain undetectable, they cannot be
higher than in the top sequence. The sequence-dependent
amplitude of power excess at 1/2νx is in line with the the-
ory proposed recently by Dziembowski (2016) to explain the
discussed form of pulsation. In this theory, the signals at
1/2νx should be observed for all sequences and correspond
to non-radial modes of diﬀerent ℓ, for which the observed
amplitudes diﬀer due to geometric cancellation. We discuss
it in more detail in Sect. 4.2.

Figure 13. The inﬂuence of the observational selection eﬀects on
the period distribution of stars with the additional variability at
νx (top panel) and on the incidence rate of power excess at 1/2νx
for stars of the three sequences in the Petersen diagram (bottom
panel).

3.6 Time-variability

Complex, non-coherent, and often broad structures, de-
tected both at νx and in some stars at 1/2νx (Figs. 9, 10 and
11), indicate strong time variation of the amplitude and/or
phase of the variability these structures represent. Because
of the low amplitudes of these signals, typically between 2
and 5 mmags, and relatively high noise level in the ground-
based observations, it is diﬃcult to analyse this variability
in more detail, with high time resolution. Still, some analy-
sis is possible for stars in which the signals are detected at
relatively high S/N . For these stars we divided the data into
four groups, each consisting of two (or in some cases three)
observing seasons. Then for each group we calculated the
discrete Fourier transform and investigated the frequency
spectrum at around νx and 1/2νx. Results of the analysis
are presented in Fig. 14 (for OGLE-SMC-CEP-1119) and
in Fig. 15 (for OGLE-SMC-CEP-3944). Results are qualita-
tively similar for a few other stars for which such analysis
was possible.

In Fig. 14, we observe that from season to season the
amplitude and location of the peaks present at νx and at
1/2νx strongly vary. In particular, the signal at νx is signif-
icant in 2001–2005 seasons, while it is not signiﬁcant later
on. The signal at 1/2νx was insigniﬁcant in the ﬁrst observ-
ing seasons, while it was clearly present starting from 2003
and later on.

For OGLE-SMC-CEP-3944, analysed in Fig. 15, we ob-

4.1 Comparison with RR Lyr stars

A very similar form of variability is detected in RRc stars, as
already mentioned in the Introduction. The obvious similar-
ity is the characteristic period ratio, which falls into similar
range, P/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65), and the occurrence of the ad-
ditional variability in ﬁrst overtone stars (or in double-mode
stars, with fundamental and ﬁrst overtone modes simulta-
neously excited). The present study allow a more detailed
comparison.

• Incidence rate of the phenomenon. The phe-
nomenon is common among RRc stars; space observations
leave no doubt; 14 out of 15 RRc/RRd stars observed from
space show the phenomenon (see Moskalik et al. 2015). In-
cidence rates in the top-quality ground-based observations
are also high, 27 per cent in the Galactic bulge sample of
RRc stars studied by Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015b)
and 38 per cent in the M3 sample observed by Jurcsik et al.
(2015). Unfortunately, for Cepheids we lack systematic anal-
ysis of large sample of stars. The 138 stars considered here
constitute 8.4 per cent of the OGLE-III sample of 1O SMC
Cepheids. The incidence rate depends on the pulsation pe-
riod; in particular the phenomenon does not occur in the
shortest period (P1O . 0.8 d) Cepheids. For longer peri-
ods the incidence rate is ≈ 8 − 15 per cent. Space observa-
tions of 1O Cepheids are scarce. Polaris was observed with
star tracker on board Coriolis satellite (Bruntt et al. 2008),
SZ Tau was observed with MOST (Evans et al. 2015) and 2
other stars were observed with CoRoT (Poretti et al. 2015).
In these stars additional variability was not detected. Two
stars observed with K2 show the discussed form of pulsation
(Plachy et al. in prep.).

• The Petersen diagram. Both for Cepheids and for
RR Lyr stars three sequences are present – see Fig. 16. The
Cepheid sequences are slanted and well separated. The bot-
tom sequence is most populated, but the middle and top
sequences are well represented, too. In the case of RR Lyr
stars, the sequences are nearly horizontal, not that well sepa-
rated and majority of stars fall within the bottom sequence.
In both groups stars that belong to more than one sequence
are found. While in the case of RR Lyr stars there are very
good examples of stars that belong to three sequences simul-
taneously (see ﬁg. 5 in Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik 2015b), in
the case of Cepheids only stars that belong to two sequences
are found, and these are rather weak cases (Fig. 3).

• Amplitudes. Both in Cepheids and in RR Lyr stars
the additional periodicity is of low amplitude, in the mmag
range. In both cases the most typical amplitude is around
2 per cent of the ﬁrst overtone amplitude [compare ﬁg. 7 in
Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015b) and Fig. 6].

• Subharmonics. Both in Cepheids and in RR Lyr stars
signiﬁcant power excess centred at 1/2νx is detected. Sub-
harmonics are detected in 20 per cent of the sample of Galac-
tic bulge RRc stars with additional variability analysed
by Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015b) and in 35 per cent
of the present Cepheid sample. Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik
(2015b) reported the power excess also at 3/2νx, other cases
are known from space observations (see e.g. Moskalik et al.
2015; Moln´ar et al. 2015; Kurtz et al. 2016). No ﬁrm detec-
tion of power excess at 3/2νx is found in the present Cepheid

signals.
Both for Cepheids and for RR Lyr
the sig-
nals at νx and at 1/2νx are complex: power excesses,
or clusters of peaks (sometimes very broad) are de-
tected, rather than single and coherent peaks. Compare
ﬁg. 11 in Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2015b) and 2 in
Netzel, Smolec & Moskalik (2016) with Figs. 9, 10 and 11.
Such complex structures present in the frequency spectrum
correspond to strong and irregular variability of signal’s
phase and/or amplitude.

4.2 Nature of the additional variability

Based on the just presented comparison we conclude,
that the double-periodic pulsation observed both in RRc
stars and in 1O Cepheids, with characteristic period ra-
tios, Px/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65),
is qualitatively very sim-
ilar. Consequently, nature of the additional variability
and mechanism of
likely the
same. In both cases it cannot be pulsation in two radial
modes (Dziembowski & Smolec 2009; Moskalik et al. 2015).
A model or theory common for the two groups should be
searched for.

its excitation are most

Dziembowski

(2012) proposed an explanation for
Cepheids. The additional variability at νx was interpreted
as a non-radial f-mode of high angular degree. The three
Cepheid sequences were reproduced assuming that addi-
tional modes have ℓ = 42 (top sequence) ℓ = 46 (middle
sequence) and ℓ = 50 (bottom sequence). Due to geomet-
ric cancellation, modes of such large angular degree are ex-
pected to have very low observed amplitudes. Two problems
arise then, however. First, the geometric cancellation is lower

for even-ℓ modes and, at high degrees, is roughly the same
for these modes (depends only on mode parity). Hence, if
ℓ = 42, 46 and 50 are observed, then ℓ = 44 and ℓ = 48
should be observed as well (all these modes are linearly un-
stable), which is not the case. Second, the required intrinsic
amplitudes are very high, implying large broadening of the
spectral lines. Both problems are discussed in Dziembowski
(2012). When this model was proposed it was not known
that in these stars subharmonics are detected. RR Lyr stars
were not studied by Dziembowski (2012).

Lindner et al. (2015) focused on RR Lyr stars, in par-
ticular on one star observed by Kepler (KIC5520878) and
noticed that its period ratio is close to the reciprocal of
the golden ratio, 1/ϕ ≈ 0.618. Lindner et al. (2015) ar-
gue that the dynamics driven by two frequencies in the
golden ratio maximally resist perturbations. As noted by
Smolec, Netzel & Soszy´nski (2016) and also well visible in
Fig. 16, in which we mark 1/ϕ with an arrow, the stars avoid
the golden ratio. In our opinion the proximity of period ratio
to 1/ϕ in some RR Lyr stars is a pure coincidence.

Recently, Dziembowski (2016) proposed a new explana-
tion, in which the signal observed at 1/2νx corresponds to
non-radial, ℓ = 7−9 modes. The signal at νx is its harmonic,
which gains the signiﬁcant amplitude due to non-linear,
quadratic eﬀect. According to this model, stars in which sub-
harmonics are detected should not be distributed uniformly
among sequences visible in the Petersen diagram. As geo-
metric cancellation is lower for even-ℓ modes we should ob-
serve the power excess at subharmonic, i.e. we should detect
the true non-radial mode, preferentially in sequences which
correspond to even-ℓ pulsation. In the case of Cepheids it is
the middle sequence (ℓ = 8; νx = 2ν8). The top sequence
corresponds to ℓ = 7, while the lower sequence to ℓ = 9.
Geometric cancellation is slightly lower for ℓ = 7 than for
ℓ = 9. In Fig. 16, we observe a nice qualitative conﬁrmation
of this theory for Cepheids.

In the case of RR Lyr stars, the top sequence corre-
sponds to even ℓ (ℓ = 8) and subharmonic detection (non-
radial ℓ = 8 mode detection) should be more common there.
According to the Dziembowski (2016) theory, the bottom,
most populated sequence for RR Lyr stars, corresponds to
odd-ℓ mode (ℓ = 9). The weakly marked middle sequence
corresponds to the combination frequency (ν8 + ν9) and no
subharmonics should be detected there. This is indeed what
we observe – Fig. 16. Detailed description of the model is in
preparation (Dziembowski & Smolec, in prep.)

5 SUMMARY

We have analysed 138 1O Cepheids from the SMC in which
Soszy´nski et al. (2010) reported additional variability with
P/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65). These stars form three sequences in
the Petersen diagram. Our most important ﬁndings are the
following.

• The three sequences in the Petersen diagram are not
equally populated. In 64 stars we detect periodicities corre-
sponding to the bottom sequence, in 54 stars corresponding
to the middle sequence and in 26 stars corresponding to the
top sequence. The numbers do not add up to 138 as in the
frequency spectra of six stars we detect two signiﬁcant peri-
odicities that correspond to two of the three sequences.

Smolec & ´Sniegowska

• The additional variability is always of low amplitude,
typically about 2–4 per cent of the ﬁrst overtone amplitude
(between 2 and 5 mmag) – Figs. 5 and 6.

• In 35 per cent of stars (25 per cent if weak cases are ex-
cluded), we detect power excess centred at 1/2νx, i.e. at sub-
harmonic. The power excess is often broad and of complex
structure (Figs. 9 and 10). Amplitude of the signal detected
at 1/2νx is comparable to amplitude of the signal detected
at νx – Fig. 12.

• Stars in which power excess at subharmonic is detected
are not uniformly distributed in the Petersen diagram –
Figs. 1 and 16. Subharmonics are detected most frequently
in the stars of the middle sequence (in 74 per cent of stars;
59 per cent excluding weak cases). Incidence rate is much
lower for the top sequence (31 per cent or 8 per cent without
weak cases). Subharmonics are not detected in stars of the
bottom sequence.

• The additional variability (both at νx and at 1/2νx)
its amplitude and/or phase,

is strongly non-stationary;
strongly vary in time (Figs. 14 and 15).

• A similar form of pulsation, in which radial ﬁrst over-
tone and additional low-amplitude variability is detected
with period ratios Px/P1O ∈ (0.60, 0.65), is also present
in RR Lyr stars. A detailed comparison we have done in-
dicates, that the nature of this phenomenon is most likely
the same in both groups of classical pulsators. Therefore, a
common theory to explain this puzzling form of pulsation
should be searched for.

• In the Petersen diagram, the distribution of stars in
which power excess at subharmonic is detected is not uni-
form, both for Cepheids and for RR Lyr stars (Fig. 16). The
observed distribution favors the model proposed recently by
Dziembowski (2016) (Sect. 4.2).

It is very important to establish the incidence rate of the
discussed form of pulsation in Cepheids, to check whether
it is as common as in RR Lyr stars. The systematic search
in the OGLE data was started. It seems crucial however,
to observe 1O Cepheids from space with K2 mission. High-
precision photometry it gathers, oﬀers the possibility to de-
tect periodicities of very low amplitude. Detection of power
excess at subharmonic frequencies for stars that belong to
diﬀerent sequences, and study of the amplitude distribution
of these signals, is crucial to test the model proposed by
Dziembowski (2016).

is an excellent agreement between our studies. In 6 stars the
small diﬀerences are a consequence of the complex form in
which additional variability appears in the frequency spec-
trum (see Fig. 2 and Sect. 3.1) – two close peaks of similar
height or cluster of peaks. Small diﬀerences in the analysis
(detrending, outlier rejection) may slightly alter the relative
height of the peaks and lead to slightly diﬀerent frequencies
adopted in the two studies. The diﬀerence in the resulting
period ratios is negligible however. Two examples are illus-
trated in the top two panels of Fig. 2 in which ﬁlled dia-
monds mark the frequency adopted in this study and open
diamonds mark the frequency adopted in S10.

More signiﬁcant diﬀerences are due to alias ambiguities
and are found for six stars, described below on a star-by-
star basis. Still, only for one star the period ratios in the two
studies diﬀer by 3 per cent. For ﬁve other stars the diﬀerence
is less than 1 per cent.

OGLE-SMC-CEP-1127 – the diﬀerence for this star is
a result of long-term trend, likely not removed by S10. Its
one day alias falls at P/P1O ≈ 0.6084 and was interpreted
as additional variability in S10. The trend is well visible in
the residual data. After removing the trend with third order
polynomial the one day alias also disappears, but another
signal at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6270 is present, which we interpret as
due to additional variability.

OGLE-SMC-CEP-2131 – the diﬀerence for this star is a
result of strongly non-stationarity of the ﬁrst overtone. One-
day alias (at P/P1O ≈ 0.6215) of the strong, residual peak at
the frequency of ﬁrst overtone was likely interpreted as addi-
tional variability by S10. After time-dependent prewhitening
the ambiguous signal disappears, but we detect another sig-
niﬁcant peak nearby, at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6163, and interpret as
due to additional variability.

OGLE-SMC-CEP-3094 – after prewhitening with ν1O
and its harmonics (and detrending) the strongest peak is
present at Px/P1O = 0.6366, as given in Tab. 1. Its daily alias
falls very close to ν1O (resolved) and likely was prewhitened

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–19

by S10 ﬁrst. Then, the highest peak is found at Px/P1O ≈
0.6327 as is reported in S10. Both solutions are likely.

OGLE-SMC-CEP-3098 – after prewhitening with ν1O
and its harmonics (and detrending) the strongest peak in the
P/P1O ∈ (0.6, 0.65) range is detected at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6094 as
reported in Tab. 1. Its daily alias is higher however, it falls at
P/P1 ≈ 0.913 and can be interpreted as other periodicity. In
S10 this peak was likely prewhitened ﬁrst. Then, the highest
peak in the frequency range of interest appears at Px/P1O ≈
0.6101 as reported in S10. Both solutions are likely.

OGLE-SMC-CEP-3349 – after prewhitening with ν1O
and its harmonics (and detrending) the highest peak in the
frequency range of interest appears at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6261, as
reported in Tab. 1. Its daily alias is higher however. There
are two lower peaks around; one of them at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6217
was reported in S10 (interestingly its daily alias is also
higher).

OGLE-SMC-CEP-4255 – after prewhitening with ν1O
and its harmonics (and detrending) the strongest peak in the
P/P1O ∈ (0.6, 0.65) range is detected at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6246
(S/N = 5.16) as given in Tab 1. Its daily alias is higher
however, it falls at P1/P = 0.496 (S/N = 5.29). In S10 this
peak was likely prewhitened ﬁrst. Then, the highest peak in
the frequency range of interest appears at Px/P1O ≈ 0.6252
as reported in S10. Both solutions are likely.

In eight stars the highest peak in the frequency range
of interest corresponds to Px/P1O falling well within one
of the three sequences visible in Fig. 1 (stars marked with
triangles), but the S/N is below 4.0 (it is reported in the
last column of Tab 1; these stars also have ‘?’ in remarks
column). Frequency spectra for these stars are plotted in
Fig. B1. Likely the additional variability is present in these
stars but its amplitude is small as compared to the noise
level.

Figure B1. Frequency spectra for eight stars in which detection
of the additional variability is weak, with 3.0 < S/N < 4.0. Di-
amond marks the location of the peak and is placed exactly at
S/N = 4.0. Ticks at the top axis of each panel correspond to
P/P1O scale, explicitly given at the top of the Figure.
