Abstract

The behaviour of fermions in the background of a double-step potential is analyzed
with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous chiral-conjugation
transformation. Provided the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling, a
Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step potential shows that the transmission
coeﬃcient exhibits oscillations and that a ﬁnite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-
state solutions might appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling
regime. An isolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled ﬁrst-order equations
might also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound solutions
disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of the so-
called spin and pseudospin symmetries in a four-dimensional space-time. Furthermore,
we show that due to the additional mass acquired by the fermion from the scalar
background the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime does
not violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Introduction

The Dirac Hamiltonian with a mixing of scalar potential and time component of vector
potential in a four-dimensional space-time is invariant under an SU(2) algebra when the
diﬀerence between the potentials, or their sum, is a constant [1]. The near realization
of these symmetries may explain degeneracies in some heavy meson spectra (spin
symmetry) [2]-[3] or in single-particle energy levels in nuclei (pseudospin symmetry)
[3]-[4]. When these symmetries are realized, the energy spectrum does not depend
on the spinorial structure, being identical to the spectrum of a spinless particle [5].
Despite the absence of spin eﬀects in 1+1 dimensions, many attributes of the spin and
pseudospin symmetries in four dimensions are preserved.

In a pioneering work, Jackiw and Rebbi [6] have shown that massless fermions cou-
pled to scalar ﬁelds with kink-like proﬁles in 1+1 dimensions develops quantum states
with fractional fermion number due to the zero-mode solution. This phenomenon has
been seen in certain polymers such as polyacetylene [7]. Later, charge fractionization
into irrational numbers was shown to emerge in a model without charge-conjugation
symmetry [8]. Charge values with irrational numbers are present in a certain discrete
model of diatomic polymers [9] which is related to charge-conjugation-invariance vi-
olation in the continuum limit [10], realizing the charge fractionization envisioned in
Ref. [8].

Recently the complete set of solutions for the kink-like scalar potential behaving
[11], and for massive
like tanh x/λ has been considered for massless fermions in Ref.
fermions in Ref.
[12]. Kink-like proﬁles violating the charge-conjugation symmetry
by addition of a time component of a vector potential has also been considered in the
literature. The complete set of solutions for massive fermions under the inﬂuence of
a kink-like scalar potential added by the time component of a vector potential with
[13] and [14], in Ref.
the same functional form was considered in Refs.
[13] for the
background ﬁeld behaving like sgn x, and in Ref.
[14] for the background behaving
like tanh x/λ. In Refs. [13] and [14], it has been shown that the Dirac equation with a
scalar potential plus a time component of vector potential of the same functional form
is manageable if the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling, and that
the bound states for mixed scalar-vector potentials with the kink-like proﬁles sgn x
and tanh x/λ are intrinsically relativistic solutions. Furthermore, it has been shown
that the fermion can be conﬁned in a highly localized region of space under a very
strong ﬁeld without any chance for spontaneous pair production related to Klein’s
paradox. In a more recent work [15], it has been shown that the existence of such
intrinsically relativistic bound states is ensured for any mixed scalar-vector potential
with a kink-like proﬁle.

Elsewhere, it has been shown that the double-step potential can furnish intrinsically
relativistic bound states when one considers a pseudoscalar coupling in the Dirac
equation [16] or a nonminimal vector coupling in the Duﬃn-Kemmer-Petiau equation
for spinless particles [17] and spin-1 particles [18]. However, the double-step potential
does not seem to have received any attention regarding scalar and vector couplings
in the Dirac equation.
In what follows the mixing formalism developed in [13]-[14]
is addressed to the double-step potential. We shall present a fairly complete account
of the problem and show that, in contrast to the case of a sign step potential of
Ref.
[14], aside from the isolated

[13] and alike the smooth step potential of Ref.

1

solution the spectrum might consist of a ﬁnite set of bound-state solutions under a
strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we shall show that the fermion can be trapped
in a highly localized region under an extreme relativistic regime and that this high
localization maintains the single-particle interpretation of the Dirac theory because the
fermion acquires an additional mass coming from its interaction with the scalar-ﬁeld
background. A distinctive aspect of this problem is that the transmission coeﬃcient
exhibits oscillations. The limit where the double-step potential becomes the sign
potential is also considered. We begin by reviewing those results of Refs.
[13], [14]
and [15] which are directly relevant for the present work.

2 Mixed scalar-vector interactions

Consider the Lagrangian density for a massive fermion

L = ¯Ψ(cid:0)icγµ∂µ − Imc2 − V(cid:1) Ψ

(1)

where  is the constant of Planck, c is the velocity of light, I is the unit matrix,
m is the mass of the free fermion and the square matrices γµ satisfy the algebra
{γµ, γν} = 2Igµν. The spinor adjoint to Ψ is deﬁned by ¯Ψ = Ψ†γ0. For vector and
scalar interactions the matrix potential is written as V = γµAµ + IVs. Requiring
(γµ)† = γ0γµγ0, one ﬁnds the continuity equation ∂µJ µ = 0, where the conserved
current is J µ = c ¯ΨγµΨ. Eq. (1) leads to the Hamiltonian form for the Dirac equation
i∂Ψ/∂t = HΨ. In 1+1 dimensions Ψ is a 2×1 matrix, the metric tensor is gµν =
diag(1,−1) and the Hamiltonian is given by

H = γ5c(cid:18)p1 +

A1

c (cid:19) + IA0 + γ0(cid:0)mc2 + Vs(cid:1)

(2)

where γ5 = γ0γ1. Assuming time-independent potentials, one can write Ψ (x, t) =
ψ (x) exp (−iEt/) in such a way that the time-independent Dirac equation becomes
Hψ = Eψ. Meanwhile J µ = cψγµψ is time independent and J 1 is uniform. From
now on, we make A1 = 0 and use an explicit representation for the 2×2 matrices γ as
γ0 = σ3 and γ1 = iσ2. Here, σ2 and σ3 stand for the Pauli matrices.
The charge-conjugation operation is accomplished by the transformation ψ → σ1ψ∗
followed by A0 → −A0, Vs → Vs and E → −E [19]. The chiral-conjugation operation
ψ → γ5ψ (according to Ref.
[20]) is followed by the changes of the signs of Vs and
m, but not of A0 and E [19]. One sees that the charge-conjugation and the chiral-
conjugation operations interchange the roles of the upper and lower components of the
Dirac spinor. The continuous chiral transformation (see, e.g., [21]) is induced by the
unitary operator

U(θ) = exp(cid:18)−

θ
2

iγ5(cid:19)

where θ is a real quantity such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. It allows one to write

hφ = Eφ, φ = Uψ,

h = UHU−1

with

h = σ1cp1 + IA0 + σ3(cid:0)mc2 + Vs(cid:1) cos θ − σ2(cid:0)mc2 + Vs(cid:1) sin θ

2

(3)

(4)

(5)

With A0 and Vs related by

and eliminating A0 in favor of Vs, one can rewrite the Dirac equation in terms of the
upper (φ+) and lower (φ−) components of φ as

A0 = Vs cos θ

In this way one can solve the Dirac problem for determining the possible discrete

for sin θ 6= 0. N+ and N− are normalization constants. Note that these solutions
isolated from the Sturm-Liouville problem can not describe scattering states and J 1 =
2cRe(cid:0)N∗+N−(cid:1). A bound-state solution demands N+ = 0 or N− = 0, because φ+ and
φ− are square-integrable functions. There is no bound-state solution for sin θ = 0,
and for sin θ 6= 0 the existence of a bound state solution depends on the asymptotic
behaviour of v(x) [22].

3 Kink potentials

Now we consider a kink-like potential with the asymptotic behaviour Vs(x) → ±v0 as
x → ±∞, with v0 = constant.
We turn our attention to scattering states for fermions with E 6= −mc2 cos θ coming
from the left. Then, φ for x → −∞ describes an incident wave moving to the right
and a reﬂected wave moving to the left, and φ for x → +∞ describes a transmitted
wave moving to the right or an evanescent wave. The upper component for scattering
states is written as

B±e±ik+x,

for x → −∞
for x → +∞

A+e+ik−x + A−e−ik−x,

If E > −mc2 cos θ, then A+e+ik−x (A−e−ik−x) will describe the incident (reﬂected)
wave, and B− = 0. On the other hand, if E < −mc2 cos θ, then A−e−ik−x (A+e+ik−x)
will describe the incident (reﬂected) wave, and B+ = 0. Therefore, the reﬂection and
transmission amplitudes are given by

As for E = −mc2 cos θ, the existence of a bound-state solution requires |v0| > mc2
so that, deﬁning ˜φT = (1 i cot θ) for v0 > +mc2, and ˜φT = (0 1) for v0 < −mc2, the
eigenspinor behaves asymptotically as φ ∼ ˜φf with

f = exp(cid:26)−

4 The double-step potential

Now we assume a scalar potential in the form

Vs = v0 [Θ (x − a) − Θ (−x − a)]

4

(21)

(22)

with v0 and a deﬁned to be real numbers (a > 0) and Θ (x) is the Heaviside step
function. Notice that Vs is invariant under a coincidental change of the signs of v0
and x, and that as a → 0 the double-step approximates the sign potential already
considered in Ref. [13].
Our problem is to solve the set of equations (7a)-(7b) for φ and to determine the

allowed energies for both classes of solutions sketched in Sec. 2.

4.1 The case E 6= −mc2 cos θ

For our model,

Veff = (V1 + V2) Θ (x − a)+(V1 − V2) Θ (−x − a)− sgn (v0)rV1

[δ (x − a) + δ (x + a)]
(23)
where δ (x) = dΘ (x) /dx is the Dirac delta function and the following abbreviations
have been used:

2

V1 =

0 sin2 θ
v2
2c2

V2 = v0

E cos θ + mc2

c2

(24a)

(24b)

For V1 = 0, Veff is an ascendant (a descendant) double step if V2 > 0 (V2 < 0).
For V1 6= 0, the “eﬀective potential” includes attractive (repulsive) delta functions at
x = ±a if v0 > 0 (v0 < 0). It has plateaus given by V1 ± V2 for x ≷ ±a (Veff = 0 for
|x| < a) and so we can consider scattering states for fermions coming from the left with
Eeff > V1 − V2. Due to the discontinuities (for V1 = 0) or singularities (for V1 6= 0)
of Veff at x = ±a one should expect resonant transmission for certain values of Eeff.
Furthermore, for V2 > V1 and Eeff < 0 one should expect nonprogressive waves in the
region |x| < a and no transmission whereas the transmission is ubiquitous for V2 ≤ 0.
Bound-state solutions for |V2| < V1 with 0 < Eeff < V1 −|V2| should be expected even
if v0 < 0 (delta functions apart, φ+ is insensitive to simultaneous changes in the signs
of v0 and x). It is instructive to note that V1 tends to vanish as |v0|/mc2 → 0 so that
the eﬀective potential becomes the double-step potential in a nonrelativistic scheme.

We demand that φ+ be continuous at x = ±a , that is
ε→0(cid:0) φ+|x=±a+ε − φ+|x=±a−ε(cid:1) = 0

lim

(25)

Otherwise, the diﬀerential equation for φ+ would contain derivative of δ-functions.
Eﬀects on dφ+/dx in the neighbourhood of x = ±a can be evaluated by integrating
the diﬀerential equation for φ+ from ±a − ε to ±a + ε and taking the limit ε → 0.
The connection formulas for dφ+/dx can be summarized as

4.1.1 Scattering states

We turn our attention to scattering states for fermions coming from the left as sketched
in Sec. 3. The upper component for scattering states on the entire space is written as

φ+ = [1 − Θ (x + a)](cid:0)A+e+iζ−x/a + A−e−iζ−x/a(cid:1)

+ [Θ (x + a) − Θ (x − a)](cid:0)C+e+iξx/a + C−e−iξx/a(cid:1)
+Θ (x − a) B±e±iζ+x/a

where

ζ± = ak±

(32c)
For E < −mc2 cos θ, the amplitudes can be obtained by taking the complex conju-
gate of the right-hand side of (31) and exchanging the signs of the subscripts of the
amplitudes. It follows that

T = T≷ =

(34b)

taking no regard if E > −mc2 cos θ or E < −mc2 cos θ. Because we chose fermions
coming from the left, the transmission coeﬃcient is not invariant under the change of
v0 by −v0, however, this symmetry is exact when T 6= 0. The transmission coeﬃcient
does not depends on the sign of E in the case of a pure scalar coupling. It is true that
ξ imaginary makes ζ− imaginary. Naturally, the transmission does not exist neither
does the incidence if ξ is small enough to make ζ− imaginary. The transmission is
possible only if ζ− and ζ+ are real quantities and this fact imposes a cutoﬀ on ξ. As
a function of ξ, the transmission coeﬃcient rises from zero for a certain ξ, oscillates
between extreme values and approaches T = 1 as ξ → ∞. This is in contrast to the
transmission coeﬃcient for the sign potential [13], where no oscillation exists. The
maxima of T occur when

ξn = (cid:18)n −

1

2(cid:19) π

2

, nmin < n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

and they are osculated by the function

Tmax =

4ξ2

(ζ− + ζ+)2

4ζ−Re ζ+

(ζ− + ζ+)2 + (2v)2

(35)

(36)

nmin is associated with the cutoﬀ on ξ. On the other hand, the minima of T occur
when ξ = (n + 1) π/2, and they are osculated by the function

Tmin =

4ζ−Re ζ+

(ζ− + ζ+)2 + (2v)2

(37)

The maxima (or minima) are regularly separated from each other by ξ = π/2 and seen
as a function of E they are more scarce the small a. As a matter of fact, as a → 0 one
ﬁnds the transmission coeﬃcient for the sign step potential [13]: T ≃ Tmin. It is also
worthwhile to note that the oscillations in the transmission coeﬃcient only manifest
in a nonrelativistic scheme if a ≫ λC. Fig. 1 shows the transmission coeﬃcient as a
function of ξ for v0/mc2 = 1, a/λC = 1/2 and θ = 3π/8.

4.2 Bound states

Following the previous qualitative considerations, we discuss the existence of bound
states. One way to identify the possible bound-state solutions is to look for the poles of
the transmission amplitude in the complex ζ-plane. If one considers the transmission
amplitude t± in (19) as a function of the complex variables ζ± one sees that bound
states would be obtained by the poles along the imaginary axis of the complex ζ-plane.
These poles require A± = 0 and B± 6= 0, corresponding to E ≷ −mc2 cos θ. Further-
more, square-integrability of φ+ demands ζ− = ±i|ζ−| and ζ+ = ±i|ζ+|. Therefore,

7

the bound states would occur for Σ = σ+/µ, even if ξ = 0. Here Σ = |ζ−| + |ζ+|.
Hence,
(38)

Σ = 2v

or

Σ = −2ξ cot 2ξ

(39)

Eqs. (38) and (39) would determinate the energies of the bound states. Notice that
any possible solution demands Σ > 0.

It is easy to see that (38) is impossible for v < 0. Eq. (38) has not even solution for
v > 0. In fact, squaring (38) results in the form of a second-degree algebraic equation

E2 + 2mc2E cos θ + m2c4 cos2 θ = 0

(40)

which presents just one solution for v > 0, viz. E = −mc2 cos θ, without regard to a.
Evidently, it is not a proper solution of the problem.
The remaining quantization condition, Eq. (39), has no solution if ξ is imaginary
because its right-hand side would be a negative number. For ξ ∈ R (|E| > mc2),
though, it dictates that the spectrum depends on the mixing angle and that it is
symmetrical about E = 0 in the case of a pure scalar coupling. The sign of v0 does not
eﬀect the spectrum but a does. In the case of a massless fermion the spectrum does
not change when the mixing angle changes from π/2− ε to π/2 + ε. From (28) one sees
that ζ− and ζ+ are imaginary numbers only when |v0| > mc2 so that those solutions
only survive in a relativistic regime. Eq. (39) also dictates that ξ cot 2ξ < 0 so that
ξ > π/4. In addition, Eq. (29) becomes |ζ−|2 +|ζ+|2 = 2 (v2 − ξ2) for bound states and
so ξ < |v|. In this way we have to search for solutions in the interval π/4 < ξ < |v|,
corresponding to

4a (cid:19)2
(cid:18) πc

< E2 − m2c4 < (v0 sin θ)2

(41)

At once, we can state that the possible spectrum for bound states calls for sin θ 6= 0
and a minimum value for a|v0| sin θ, namely

a|v0| sin θ >

πc

4

(42)

The graphical method for ξ ∈ R is illustrated in Fig. 2. The solutions for bound
states are given by the intersection of the curves represented by Σ with the curve
represented by −2ξ cot 2ξ. Seen as a function of ξ, Σ is a two-branch decreasing
function which begins with Σ ≃ 2a sin θp|v0| (|v0| + mc2)/c at ξ = 0 and ends for
some ξ > 0. The branch of solutions with E < −mc2 cos θ (E > −mc2 cos θ) is more
favoured for θ < π/2 (θ > π/2). Above of critical values of |v0|, a and sin θ there will
be a ﬁnite sequence of bound states with

and |v0| > mc2. In point of fact, from (45) one can see that (42) is the condition that
there is at least one bound-state solution and that the number of possible bound states
depends on the size of a|v0| sin θ. The number of possible bound states is determined
by the maximum value of n satisfying inequality (45). Numerical solutions for the
eigenenergies corresponding to n = 1 as a function of v0/mc2 are shown in Fig. 3
for diﬀerent values of a and θ. The case of a massless fermion, as already discussed
before with fulcrum on the charge-conjugation and the chiral-conjugation operations,
presents a spectrum symmetrical about E = 0 and seen as a function of θ exhibits an
additional symmetry about θ = π/2.

−mc2 cos θ can be obtained by taking the complex conjugate of the right-hand side of
(31b) and exchanging the signs of the subscripts of the amplitudes. Fig. 4 shows the
normalized position probability density for a massive fermion for the Sturm-Liouville
solution with n = 1, v0/mc2 = 5, a/λC = 1 and θ = 3π/8.

In this case, one ﬁnds

v (x) = v0 [a + (|x| − a) Θ (|x| − a)]

As commented before, there is no solution for sin θ = 0. The normalizable solution for

Therefore, a massive fermion tends to concentrate at the left (right) region when v0 > 0
(v0 < 0), and tends to avoid the origin more and more as sin θ decreases. A massless

fermion has a position probability density symmetric around the origin (though r → ∞
and α → 0 as m → 0, rα → constant). One can see that the best localization occurs
for a pure scalar coupling. In fact, the fermion becomes delocalized as sin θ decreases.

one recovers the value for φ in the case of the sign potential (at small a) as in Ref. [13].
Fig. 5 illustrates the position probability density for a massive fermion with r = 5

Again one can see that the fermion becomes delocalized as sin θ decreases and that
the best localization occurs for a pure scalar coupling. More than this, | < x > | → ∞
and ∆x → ∞ as r → 1. The values for < x > and ∆x as α → 0 (either in the case of
sin θ → 0 or m → 0 or in the case of the sign potential as in Ref. [13]) are given by

reduces its extension then ∆p will must expand, in consonance with the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. Nevertheless, the maximum uncertainty in the momentum is
comparable with mc requiring that is impossible to localize a fermion in a region of
space less than or comparable with half of its Compton wavelength (see, for example,
[23]). This impasse can be broken by resorting to the concepts of eﬀective mass and
eﬀective Compton wavelength.
Indeed, if one deﬁnes an eﬀective mass as meff =
m√r2 + 1 and an eﬀective Compton wavelength λeff = / (meffc), one will ﬁnd

∆xmin =

λeff√2 sin θ

It follows that the high localization of fermions, related to small values of a and strong
coupling, never menaces the single-particle interpretation of the Dirac theory even if
the fermion is massless (meff = |v0|/c2). This fact is convincing because the scalar
coupling exceeds the vector coupling, and so the conditions for Klein’s paradox are
never reached. As a matter of fact, (55b) furnishes (∆x)min ≃ λeff/(√2 sin θ) for
|v0| ≫ mc2.

5 Final remarks

After reviewing the use of a continuous chiral transformation for solving the Dirac
equation in the background of scalar and vector potentials, already applied to the sign
potential in Ref. [13] and to the smooth step potential in Ref. [14], we have extended
the methodology to the double-step potential. A common characteristic of all those
kink-like potentials is the appearance of an intrinsically relativistic isolated bound-
state solution corresponding to the zero-mode solution of the massive Jackiw-Rebbi
model in the case of no vector coupling. A ﬁnite set of bound-state solutions appears
as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime for the double-step
potential but all of these solutions coming from the Sturm-Liouville problem tend
to disappear as the double-step potential approximates the sign potential.
It was
also shown that all the bound solutions, including the isolated solution, disappear
asymptotically as the magnitude of the scalar and vector coupling becomes the same.
Furthermore, we show that due to the sizeable mass gain from the scalar background
the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime is conformable to
comply with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore, those bound states can
be highly localized by very strong potentials without any chance of spontaneous pair
production. A very distinctive feature of the double-step potential is the sequence of
transmission resonances not seen in the other kinds of kink potentials (like sgn x in
[13] and tanh x/λ in [14]).

The adiabatic method for studying the charge fractionization developed in Ref. [8]
depends on the background ﬁeld and it is only reliable for small spacial gradients [24].
The complete set of stationary solutions with sharp discontinuities for the kink-like
background ﬁeld might be useful for additional studies of charge fractionization.
