We describe a scheme for entangling mechanical resonators employing the radiation pressure force of the
squeezed light produced by a degenerate optical parametric oscillator, which acts as a reservoir of quantum
correlations (squeezed reservoir). Two mechanical resonators are eﬃciently driven in a stationary entangled
EPR state, also beyond the resolved sideband regime, when the spectral bandwidth of the reservoir and the ﬁelds
frequencies are appropriately selected. The protocol can be extended to the preparation of many entangled pairs
of resonators which interact with the same light ﬁeld, in a situation in which the optomechanical system realizes
a star-like harmonic network.

Micro and Nano-Mechanical resonators represent a promis-
ing platform for the investigation of macroscopic quantum
mechanical phenomena which involve the collective dynam-
ics of a large number of quantum constituents. These studies
are interesting, on the one hand, for the study of the bound-
ary between classical and quantum realm, and on the other for
possible quantum technology applications [1, 2]. Quantum
behavior of mechanical degrees of freedom, such as squeez-
ing [3, 4] and the entanglement with light ﬁelds [5], have
been already observed. Much eﬀort is currently devoted to the
preparation of entangled mechanical systems [6–14]. Among
the many proposals, a few have suggested the use of squeezed
light as a convenient reservoir of quantum correlations which
could be transferred to the mechanical elements in order to
entangle them [15–17]. Squeezed light is actually used as a
powerful tool to manipulate atomic, optical, mechanical and
biological systems, and it has allowed, for example, for the
squeezing of the collective spin of a gas of atoms [18], for the
modiﬁcation of the radiation properties of artiﬁcial atoms [19]
and for enhancing the sensitivity of detection devices [20–25].
Squeezed light has been also proposed as an eﬃcient tool to
entangle arrays of quantum system by driving one or a few of
its elements [26–28].

In this context, here we propose a novel scheme for the
steady state preparation of two mechanical resonators, which
are coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity, in a two-
mode squeezed state (EPR entanglement) by feeding the cav-
ity with the squeezed light, generated by a degenerate para-
metric oscillator operating below threshold. We employ a de-
scription which takes into accounts the ﬁniteness of the spec-
tral bandwidth of the squeezed reservoir, similar to Refs. [27,
29], and we show that the scheme is eﬀective also beyond the
resolved sideband regime, when the cavity linewidth is of the
order of the mechanical frequency (a regime that is typically
considered ineﬃcient for quantum manipulations of optome-
chanical systems). This is achieved by properly selecting the
bandwidth of the squeezed ﬁeld, hence demonstrating that the
engineering of the spectral properties of the reservoir can be
instrumental to the realization of quantum-coherent dynamics.
this
scheme is more eﬃcient than other similar protocols. Specif-
ically, with respect to Ref. [16] our scheme makes use of
a single optical cavity, and hence it is signiﬁcantly simpler

Moreover, also in the resolved sideband regime,

and easier to be realized experimentally. Besides, diﬀerently
from Ref. [17] that describes the squeezing of a single col-
lective mode of the two resonators (while the orthogonal one
remains decoupled from the light), in our scheme both col-
lective modes can be eﬃciently squeezed hence realizing a
highly pure state with genuine EPR correlations which exhibit
signiﬁcantly larger entanglement.

Our proposal can be also generalized to the preparation of
many pairs of entangled mechanical resonators which interact
with a single optical cavity. These results are reminiscent of
those described in [28]. However, while in [28] the steady
state entanglement of many pairs is discussed for the case of
a chain of harmonic oscillators, here we show that analogous
results can be achieved also for a diﬀerent topology of the
quantum array. In fact, the optomechanical system realizes
a star-like network of oscillators where the central one is the
optical cavity, which is driven by the squeezed reservoir, and
the mechanical resonators constitute the external nodes which
get entangled in pairs.

We ﬁrst consider two mechanical resonators, at frequencies
ω j for j = 1, 2 and which are damped at rate γ j. They inter-
act by radiation pressure with a resonant mode of an optical
cavity at frequency ωa, linewidth κa, and which is simultane-
ously driven by a pump laser ﬁeld at frequency ωL and by a
squeezed ﬁeld, with central frequency ωs [see Fig. 1 (a)]. The
squeezed ﬁeld is generated by a degenerate parametric oscil-
lator arranged in a cascade conﬁguration [30, 31] with the op-
tomechanical system. In our scheme the pump frequency is
always smaller then the cavity frequency and the resonators
are suﬃciently weakly coupled to the cavity ﬁeld hence as-
suring the stability of the system [32]. In this case the op-
tomechanical dynamics can be linearized about the average
cavity ﬁeld and mechanical oscillations, such that the quan-
tum Langevin equations for the ﬂuctuations, described by the
annihilation and creation operators of cavity photons, a and
a†, and of mechanical excitations, b j and b†j, in a reference
in which the cavity is rotating at the squeezed ﬁeld frequency
ωs and the mechanical resonators at the detuning frequency

fect of the external electromagnetic environment and its cor-
relation functions are determined by the output ﬁeld of the
degenerate parametric oscillator, that is characterized by the
non-linear self-interaction strength χ and the cavity linewidth
κc, and whose annihilation and creation operators c and c†,

fulﬁll the equation ˙c = −κc c + χ c† + √2κccin. Apart from

the environmental modes which are squeezed by the para-
metric oscillator and that are controlled to drive the optome-
chanical system, other uncontrolled external vacuum modes
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld induce additional optical losses
at rate κ′a and κ′c to the cavities of, respectively, the optome-
chanical system and the parametric oscillator. In our model,
it amounts in considering input noise operators of the form

+ pκ′z z′in(cid:17) / √κz for z ∈ {a, c}, that have

zin = (cid:16)pκz − κ′z z(s)
been decomposed as the sum of two uncorrelated bosonic op-
erators: z(s)
in which is related to the external squeezed modes,
and z′in for residual uncontrolled vacuum modes of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Note that here κz is the total decay rate so
that κ′z ≤ κz. The delta correlated input noise operator a′in, c′in
and c(s)
in obey the relation Da′in(t) a′in†(t′)E = Dc′in(t) c′in†(t′)E =

ture of the ﬁeld, namely it is the squeezing bandwidth, and
similarly r− is the decay rate of the correlations of the anti-
squeezed quadrature [32]. The expression for ν±(t) can be
used to determine a closed set of equations for the correla-
tion functions of the optomechanical system, from which it is

possible to determine the system steady state [32].

Steady state mechanical entanglement is obtained when
δ1 ∼ −δ2, namely when the detuning between pump and
squeezed ﬁeld are close to the mechanical average frequency
ǫL ∼ ω+, such that δ1 ∼ −δ2 ∼ ω−, with ω± = (ω1 ± ω2) /2
[see Fig. 1 (a)]. Under this condition, the squeezed reservoir
induces the cooling of a speciﬁc eﬀective chain of Bogoli-
ubov modes of the three oscillators (the optical cavity plus
the two mechanical resonators) the vacuum state of which is,
indeed, characterized by a two-mode squeezed state for the
mechanical resonators [32] (see Ref. [28] for similar consid-
erations in an harmonic chain). Moreover strong entangle-
ment can not be achieved when the mechanical resonators are

mechanical dark mode, namely a normal mode with only me-
chanical components, which, hence, remains unaﬀected by the
light (see also Ref. [17]). The condition of opposite detun-
ings is analogous to the one identiﬁed in Ref. [12], where the
cooling of mechanical Bogoliubov modes is induced by two-
frequency drives. In the present case, the steady state entan-
glement results from the transfer of quantum correlations from
the squeezed reservoir to the mechanical resonators, hence it
can be achieved eﬃciently when only the red sideband tran-
sitions, which describe exchange of excitations between vi-
brations and light, are relevant. Non-resonant blue sideband
transition, described by the time dependent terms in Eq. (1),
are instead detrimental eﬀects which degrade the transfer dy-
namics and, thus, should be negligible.

Typically, in order to select speciﬁc mechanical processes
one works in the resolved sideband regime that is character-
ized by a large mechanical frequency ω j ≫ G j, κa. Under
this condition, optimal entanglement is obtained when ǫa ∼ 0
(that together with the condition of opposite detunings implies
ωa − ωL ∼ ω+). In this case the system dynamics is accu-
rately described by a model with an inﬁnite bandwidth reser-
voir achieved for r+ → ∞ (corresponding to a Lindbland mas-
ter equation with time independent coeﬃcients). However,
we remark that, in reality eﬃcient entanglement is obtained
whenever r+ ≫ δ j, G j, γ j nT j, that is when r+ is much larger
than the the relevant band of frequency of the optoemchani-
cal dynamics which is characterized by only the mechanical
detunings δ j, the damping rates γ j nT j and the couplings G j.
Beyond the resolved sideband regime, instead, the standard
description of a broadband reservoir would predict no entan-
glement. Here we demonstrate that, by properly selecting the
squeezing bandwidth and the ﬁeld frequencies, our scheme
works eﬃciently also when κa & ω+. While the cooling of the
Bogoliubov modes always requires δ1 ∼ −δ2 (i.e ǫL ∼ ω+), in
this case, in order to reduce the eﬀect of blue sideband transi-
tions, it results convenient to reduce the pump frequency, such
that ωa − ωL > ω+, as a compromise between eﬃcient driving
and reduction of blue sideband processes, in a way similar to
the optimization of laser cooling with large cavity linewidth.
Then, the condition of opposite mechanical detunings can be
maintained by shifting correspondingly also the frequency of
the squeezed ﬁeld ωs so that also ǫa increases. The eﬀect
of the blue sideband transitions can be further mitigated, and
strong entanglement can be achieved, by reducing the reser-

voir photons at the blue sideband frequency, namely by using
squeezed reservoir with a ﬁnite bandwidth which should be
not much larger than the mechanical frequencies.

The results that we have just discussed are described by
Fig. 1 (b)-(l). We characterize the steady state entanglement in
terms of the Logarithmic negativity EN for the two resonators,
that can be computed by standard techniques in terms of the
correlation matrix of the system [32]. In (b) we plot EN as
a function of ω−. We observe a wide region of strong en-
tanglement, of the order of the average mechanical frequency
ω+, limited by blue sideband transitions which become rele-
vant at large ω−, and that drops to zero at ω− = 0 as a con-
sequence of the presence of the mechanical dark mode [the
one describing the relative motion in the case of Fig. 1 (b)-
(d)]. At ﬁnite ω−, the observed entanglement is of EPR type
with two orthogonal collective mechanical variables which are
squeezed below the noise vacuum level as shown in Fig. 1 (c),
and the maximum achievable squeezing is essentially equal to
the squeezing of the reservoir. Close to the degenerate case
ω− ∼ 0, instead, only one variable can be eﬃciently squeezed
because the other, that corresponds to the dark mode, is de-
coupled from the light. Plot (e) shows how the results corre-
sponding to the ﬁnite bandwidth (circles) exhibit always larger
EN as compared to those obtained in the inﬁnite bandwidth
limit (squares). In particular signiﬁcant values of the logarith-
mic negativity are observed also for κa & ω+, when the latter
model predicts no entanglement. Here we also show that when
additional uncontrolled optical losses (κ′a , 0 and κ′c , 0) are
taken into account the value of EN is reduced but the overall
entanglement dynamics is still in order. These results are com-
puted by optimizing EN, at each value of κa, over the squeez-

ing bandwidth, the ﬁelds frequencies and the optomechani-
cal couplings, the speciﬁc values of which are reported in the
plots (h)-(l). (h) shows that ǫL ∼ ω+ (i.e. δ1 ∼ −δ2) is al-
ways the optimal condition. (i), instead shows that ǫa should
increase correspondingly. We also note that, as depicted in (f),
the entanglement is more stable, against variation of ǫa, when
κa is large (dashed line). The ﬁnite value of the optimal band-
width is reported in (j) and correspondingly (g) shows that at
small κa (solid line) maximum EN is observed for suﬃciently
large r+, while at large κa (dashed line) the optimal range of
r+ shrinks around a value of the order of the mechanical fre-
quency. Finally the value of the optomechanical couplings are
reported in (k) and (l). Optimal EN is obtained when the cou-
plings are essentially equal as in (l) (similar to the results in
Ref. [28]), and their values should be suﬃciently small to re-
duce the eﬀect of the non-resonant blue sideband processes
[see (k)]. The sensitivity of the protocol to the other parame-
ters is discussed in [32].

This dynamics can be generalized to an arbitrary number of
pairs N of mechanical resonator inside the same optical cav-
ity. In this case the system is described by a set of equations
equal to Eq. (1) but where now the sum over j runs from 1 to
2N. Also in this case each pair can be entangled if the corre-
sponding mechanical detunings are opposite δ j = −δ j+1, and
if G j ∼ G j+1 for j ∈ {1, 3, 5 · · ·}. However the actual strength
of EN, will depends also on the values of the frequency dif-

ω− = 0 for two resonators, there can be situations in which
the achievable entanglement is degraded due to the presence

of mechanical dark modes.
In particular, all the resonators
can be eﬃciently driven into the entangled state only if none
of the normal modes of the system is orthogonal to the opti-
cal cavity. Similar considerations have been already discussed
in Ref. [28] for the preparation of many entangled pairs in a
chain of harmonic oscillators. Here we show that analogous
results are obtained for a star-like network of oscillators where
the central node is the optical cavity and the external ones the
mechanical resonators. We report in Fig. 2 a speciﬁc real-
ization, with 20 mechanical oscillators, demonstrating that all
and only the pairs with opposite mechanical detunings are ef-
( j)
ﬁciently entangled for speciﬁc values of ω
also beyond the
−
resolved sideband regime.

In conclusion we have proved, using a realistic model
which takes into account also the spectral properties of the
reservoir, that entangling mechanical degrees of freedom with

4

squeezed light is actually more eﬃcient then what previ-
ously believed, and this eﬀect is observable in the regime
of ﬁnite bandwidth which is naturally accessible in experi-
ments. Speciﬁcally we have shown that the squeezed ﬁeld
produced by a degenerate parametric oscillator can be eﬃ-
ciently employed to drive mechanical resonators into EPR
two-mode squeezed states. While the maximum entanglement
is achieved in the resolved sideband regime, this scheme is ef-
ﬁcient also beyond this regime if the squeezing bandwidth and
the ﬁelds frequencies are appropriately engineered. For exam-
ple, two mechanical resonators at frequencies 2π × 0.99GHz
and 2π × 1.01GHz, and quality factor Q ∼ 2 × 105, at a tem-
perature of 0.5K, can be eﬃciently driven to an EPR entan-
gled state featuring ∼ 7dB (∼ 3dB) of two-mode squeezing
below the vacuum noise level when coupled to an optical cav-
ity, with linewidth of 2π × 0.1MHz (2π × 1GHz) and 10% of
uncontrolled optical losses, which is fed with a ﬁeld squeezed
by 10dB over a bandwidth of the order of the mechanical fre-
quency. In a realistic scenario, in order to detect the generated
entanglement one can employ additional probe ﬁelds along
the lines discussed in Ref. [13]. Moreover this scheme is
straightforwardly generalizable to situations involving many
resonators, which could be relevant for the development of
routers for phonon-based quantum communications and infor-
mation [33–35]. With this result we have, therefore, demon-
strated that the engineering of the spectral properties of the
driving ﬁelds may be beneﬁcial for quantum technology ap-
plications.

I. EVALUATION OF THE STEADY STATE

with

Diﬀerently form the description in the main text, here we
study the system in a reference frame rotating at the laser ﬁeld
frequency ωL. In this case the linearized optomechanical dy-
namics is described by the equations

˙˜a = − (κa + i∆) ˜a + i
˙˜b j = −(cid:18)iω j +

2 (cid:19) ˜b j + i(cid:16)G j ˜a† + G∗j ˜a(cid:17) + √γ j b j,in,

where ∆ = ωa − ωL is the detuning between cavity and pump
ﬁelds, and the operators used here are related to those in
Eq. (1) of the main text by the relation

˜a = a eiǫL t
˜b j = b j eiǫL t ,

where, as deﬁned in the Letter,

ǫL = ωs − ωL .

(S.2)

(S.3)

All the other parameters are deﬁned as in the main text. More-
over, while the mechanical noise operators have the same form
in the two representations, in this case, an additional time de-
pendent phase appears in the deﬁnition of the new input noise
operator for the cavity ﬁeld, namely

˜ain = (cid:16)pκa − κ′a c(s)

out e−iǫL t + pκ′a a′in(cid:17) / √κa ,

(S.4)

where c(s)
out is the output ﬁeld of the optical parametric oscil-
lator (OPO) whose equations are given in the main text. We
assume that the OPO operates in its steady state. Hence we
can use the corresponding steady state correlation functions
to determine a set of closed equations for the optomechanical
system. Also the steady state correlation function of c(s)
out are
deﬁned in the main text, and we report them here for conve-
nience:

(S.6)
where r± = κc ± χ. Note that here κc is the total decay rate of
cavity photons and κ′c is the rate for uncontrolled optical losses
so that κ′c ≤ κc. The steady state of the OPO is further char-
acterized by the squeezing spectrum S (ω), namely the noise
spectral density associated to the maximum squeezed quadra-

ture [S.1], that in the present case is Y = c(s)
and it is given by [S.2]

(S.7)

where ω is the frequency of the spectral component of the
ﬁeld relative to the central frequency ωs. It shows that r+ is
the squeezing bandwidth of the output ﬁeld [S.3]. Similarly
one can show that the orthogonal quadrature is anti-squeezed
over a bandwidth r−. The limit of a broadband reservoir corre-
sponds to a ﬂat spectrum S (ω) =const, that is obtained when
r± → ∞.

The linearized dynamics of the ﬂuctuations is Gaussian
hence it is fully determined by their second statistical mo-
ments.
In details we analyze the equation for the correla-

tion matrix ˜V(t) = D˜a(t) ˜a(t)TE, for the vector of operators
˜a(t) = h˜a(t), ˜a†(t), ˜b1(t), ˜b†1(t), ˜b2(t), ˜b†2(t)iT

We are interested in the long-time solution ˜Vst(t) =
˜V(t). The system is stable, hence it approaches a sta-
limt→∞
tionary state at large time, if all the eigenvalues of the matrix
˜A have negative real part. Using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion
applied to the corresponding matrix for the evolution of the
quadrature operators (which is a real matrix), it is possible to
show that when ∆ > 0 this condition is equivalent to [S.4]

All the results discussed in this paper are obtained for param-

the Letter [thick red lines in Fig. 1 (b), (e)-(l), and the lines in
Fig. 1 (c), (d)] and in the next sections (thick red solid lines).

A. Broadband squeezed reservoir

The limit of a broadband reservoir is achieved when the de-
cay time of the reservoir correlation functions is very short,
namely when r± are very large, speciﬁcally much larger than
the eigenvalues of the matrix ˜A, that is for example when
r− ≫ κa, G j, γ j. In this limit it is legitimate to approximate
the correlation functions which appears in the expression for
B(t) in Eq. (S.9) as delta functions according to the relations

v−(t) ≃ 2 δ(t) n(0) = δ(t) ¯n ,
v+(t) ≃ 2 δ(t) m(0) = δ(t) ¯m

Eq. (S.21) has been used to compute numerically the results
in the Letter [thin black lines in Fig. 1 (e)-(l)] and in the next
sections (thin black solid lines).

B. Resonant processes

If we also assume large mechanical frequencies such that
∆ ≫ G j, κa, γ j and ǫL ∼ ∆, then it is possible to approxi-
mate the quantum Langevin equations in Eq. (S.2) by neglect-
ing non-resonant terms and to obtain an equation for the cor-
relation matrix with time independent coeﬃcients. In order
to do this, it is useful to describe the system in a reference
frame rotating at the detuning frequency ǫL, as in the main
text, where the operators in the two representations are related
by the relations in Eq. (S.2). Thereby the corresponding quan-
tum Langevin equations, obtained retaining only the resonant
terms (in particular we neglect blue sideband transitions), read
[see Eq. (1) in the main text]

Correspondingly the steady state solution for the correlation
matrix can be formally expressed as
Vst = −L−1 B ,

(S.23)
where L is deﬁned by the relation L C = A C + C AT .
Eq. (S.23) has been used to compute the thin dashed lines in

the ﬁgures presented in the next sections.

We remark that although Eqs. (S.16) and (S.21) are eval-
uated in a reference frame diﬀerent form the one used here
[where the relation between the two is deﬁned in Eq. (S.2)],
they can be safely used to compare the entanglement achieved

in the two representation because the entanglement is invari-
ant under local unitary operation as those deﬁned in Eq. (S.2).
When the squeezed reservoir is resonant with the optome-
chanical cavity, i.e. ǫa = 0, and the mechanical detunings are
opposite δ j = −δ2 = ω−, or equivalently ǫ+ = ω+, where we
have used the deﬁnition

ω± =

ω1 ± ω2

2

,

(S.24)

then Eq. (S.22) reproduce the model studied in [S.5], where it
is shown that a broadband squeezed reservoir can drive a chain
of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators to a steady state fea-
turing a series of nested entangled pairs when only the central
oscillator is driven by the reservoir. In this case the optome-
chanical system realizes a minimal chain of three oscillators
where the central one is the optical cavity and the other two are
the mechanical resonators which get entangled in the steady
state.

C.

Ideal limit

Here we study the ideal limit in which mechanical noise and
uncontrolled optical losses (respectively described by γ j nT j
and κ′a) are negligible. If we assume that the squeezed reser-
voir is resonant with the optomechanical cavity (i.e. ǫa = 0),
that the mechanical detunings are opposite δ j = −δ2 = ω− (or
equivalently ǫ+ = ω+) and that G1 = G2 ≡ G, then the system
dynamics is easily described by introducing the Bogoliubov
modes

ˆα = cosh(s) a − sinh(s) a†
ˆβ1 = cosh(s) b1 + sinh(s) b†2
ˆβ2 = cosh(s) b2 + sinh(s) b†1

Da† b jEst

Db†j bkEst
= δ j,k ¯n ,
hb1 b2ist = − ¯m

= 0

(S.27)

where ¯n and ¯m are deﬁned in Eq. (S.19), that correspond to
a squeezed state for the cavity ﬁeld and a two-mode EPR
entangled state for the mechanical resonators. We note that
the eﬀective number of thermal excitation for the Bogoliubov
modes is zero, ¯ns = 0, when κ′c = 0, and it corresponds to
¯m = √¯n(¯n + 1) [see Eq. (S.19)]. In this case the steady state of
the mechanical oscillators is a pure two-mode squeezed state.
When κ′c , 0, instead, the steady state is a thermal squeezed
state also in the ideal limit of negligible mechanical noise (see
Ref. [S.3] for similar considerations).

The amount of entanglement of the mechanical oscillators
can be expressed in terms of the Logarithmic negativity. It is a
measure of bipartite entanglement that, in the case of Gaussian
states, can be computed by standard techniques in terms of the
correlation matrix of the system (see for example the appendix
in Ref. [S.1] for details). In this case it is given by

E(ideal)
N

= max(cid:8)0, − log (2¯n + 1 − 2 ¯m)(cid:9)
= max(cid:8)0, − log (S (0))(cid:9)

(S.28)

where S (0) is the value of the squeezing spectrum of the
driving ﬁeld at its central frequency [see Eq. (S.7)]. This
value is actually equal to the maximum entanglement be-
tween two spectral sidebands of the continuous-wave station-
ary squeezed ﬁeld [S.1] which constitute our reservoir, as such
it is the maximum entanglement which we expect one can ex-
tract by such a ﬁeld. Eq. (S.28) has been used to compute the
solid thick grey lines reported in the next sections.

with tanh(s) = (¯n − ¯ns)/ ¯m and ¯ns = hp(2¯n + 1)2 − 4 ¯m − 1i /2

lator [S.5]) and approach a thermal state with ¯ns thermal ex-

In this section we provide additional analysis of the steady
state entanglement. In particular we investigate in detail its
dependence on the various noise sources, and we study its
sensitivity over variations of the ﬁeld frequencies, the optome-
chanical couplings and the squeezing bandwidth.

We characterize the strength of the entanglement that is
achieved in the steady state in terms of the logarithmic neg-
ativity EN for the pair of resonators, which can be evaluated
in terms of the correlation matrix of the system (see the ap-
pendix in Ref. [S.1] for details) that in turn is evaluated as
detailed in Sec. I.

In order to gain insight in the system dynamics and to un-
derstand the origin of the various behavior that we describe
hereafter we compare, in Figs. (S.1), (S.2) and (S.3), the re-
sults obtained with the full model [solid thick red curves eval-
uated with Eq. (S.16)], with other achieved with approximate
formulas which are valid under speciﬁc conditions. Specif-
ically, we also consider the results obtained with an inﬁnite

uated with Eqs (S.21)], and the results obtained when non-
resonant blue-sideband transition processes are also neglected
[dashed thin black lines, evaluated with Eq. (S.23)]. Finally
we also compare these results with the ideal limit (solid gray
lines) evaluated with Eq. (S.28).

A. Residual oscillations

In Fig. S.1, we observe that the steady state solution ex-
hibits residual oscillations, that are a results of the blue side-
band transitions. This can be understood by comparing the
result for the full model (thick red curve) with the dashed thin
curve, obtained when neglecting non-resonant terms, that in-
stead shows no oscillations. These oscillations are very small
when G j ≪ ω j, which is the regime of interest here. For this
reason and without loss of generality, the results presented in
the Letter and those described in the following sections have
been evaluated for the speciﬁc time at which the phase of
the oscillating terms is zero [namely we have set t = 0 in
Eqs. (S.16) and (S.21)]. We also note that Fig. S.1 is obtained
in the resolved sideband regime (κa ≪ ω+, G j), and as ex-
pected the three numerical results [evaluated with Eqs. (S.16),
(S.21) and (S.23)] are very close. The small diﬀerences are
due to residual eﬀects of non-resonant blue sideband transi-
tions, which reduce the maximum achievable entanglement
when the squeezing bandwidth is large as compared to the me-
chanical frequencies (see the solid thin black curve obtained
with an inﬁnite bandwidth reservoir). Finally we observe that,
due to the high quality factor of the resonators and of the rela-
tively low number of thermal excitations nT j, these curves are

10

signiﬁcantly close to the ideal limit set by the thick gray line.

B. Eﬀect of noise

The strength of the achievable steady state entanglement is
ultimately limited by the amount of squeezing of the driving
ﬁeld, by the mechanical thermal noise (at rate γ j nT j) and by
residual losses of the cavity ﬁeld (at rate κ′a).

Also the plots in Fig S.2 have been evaluated in the resolved
sideband regime and, as a result, the three curves evaluated
with Eqs. (S.16), (S.21) and (S.23) are always very close to
each other and barely distinguishable.

Fig S.2 (a) report the steady state logarithmic negativity EN
as a function of κ′c, namely the loss rate into uncontrolled out-
put electromagnetic modes of the parametric oscillator. When
κ′c is ﬁnite not all the squeezing produced by the parametric os-
cillator is eﬃciently transferred to the optomechanical system.
Hence, as this quantity is increased, the amount of squeez-
ing of the reservoir, that actually drives the optomechanical
system, is reduced and correspondingly the achievable entan-
glement decreases. In any case, as far as the reservoir is ac-
tually squeezed, the entanglement dynamics is still in order
and the value of EN is bounded by the amount of squeezing
of the reservoir as described by Eq. (S.28) and as shown by
the fact that all the curves are always very close to the ideal
value described by the solid thick grey curve. Figs. S.2(b) and
(c), instead, show that the system is close to the ideal limit
(solid thick gray line) only for suﬃciently small mechanical
noise (small γ j and nT j) and it decreases as either γ j or nT j
are increased. The entanglement is also limited by uncon-
trolled dissipation of the cavity (at rate κ′a) as shown in Fig. S.2
(d). When κ′a = 0 the external electromagnetic environment
of the optical cavity is constituted only by the modes that are
squeezed by the parametric oscillator and the entanglement is
maximum. When, instead, part of the external modes are un-
controlled they provide additional noise which degrades the
value of EN.

C. Behavior of the steady state entanglement against the ﬁeld

frequencies, the couplings and spectral properties of the

reservoir

Here we consider high quality factor resonators, with Q =
ω j/γ j ∼ 105, and with nT 1 = nT 2 = 10 excitations, that is the
regime corresponding to the results presented in the Letter.
In Fig.S.3 we report EN as a function of the ﬁelds frequen-
cies, the optomechanical couplings and the squeezing band-
width, for κa = 0.1ω+ [plots (a)-(e)] and for κa = ω+ [plots
(f)-(j)], and with the other parameters corresponding to the
optimal values identiﬁed in Fig. 1 (e) of the Letter, at the
corresponding value of κa when κ′a = 0. We note that the
most sensitive parameter is the detuning between the driv-
ing ﬁelds ǫL = ωs − ωL, reported in plots (a) and (f), which
should be set within a relatively narrow range of frequency
around the average mechanical frequencies ω+. The value of
ǫa = ωa − ωa, in plots (b) and (g), can, instead, vary over a

which neglect the non resonant processes is not valid for the value of κa used in these plots.

relatively larger range especially at large values of the cavity
bandwidth [the thick red solid lines in (b) and (g) are equal
to the lines in Fig. 1 (f) of the Letter]. Another sensitive
parameter is the diﬀerence between the optomechanical cou-
pling G− = (ω1 − ω2)/2 in plots (c) and (h). However also
in this case the system is less sensitive to G− at larger val-
ues of κa. On the contrary the optimal region of values of
G+ = (ω1 + ω2)/2 shrink sensibly as κa increases [see plots
(d) and i]. We note that although it seems reasonable that the
values of ǫL and ǫa can be easily set with suﬃcient precision

by proper tuning of the ﬁeld frequencies,it may results tech-
nically challenging to set the optomechanical couplings to the
desired values. Finally the system is signiﬁcantly stable over
the squeezing bandwidth as reported in (e) and (j).
In fact
large values of entanglement are observed over a wide range
of values which shrink mildly, at large κa, around a value of r+
of the order of the mechanical frequencies [the thick red solid
lines in (e) and (j) are equal to the lines in Fig. 1 (g) of the
Letter].
