Abstract
We investigated the eﬀects of ﬁrst-forbidden transitions in β decays on the production of the r-process A ∼ 195 peak. The theoretical
calculated β-decay rates with β-delayed neutron emission were examined using several astrophysical conditions. As the FF decay
is dominant in N ∼ 126 neutron-rich nuclei, their inclusion shortens β-decay lifetimes and shifts the abundance peak towards higher
masses. Additionally, the inclusion of the β-delayed neutron emission results in a wider abundance peak, and smoothens the mass
distribution by removing the odd-even mass staggering. The eﬀects are commonly seen in the results of all adopted astrophysical
models. Nevertheless there are quantitative diﬀerences, indicating that remaining uncertainty in the determination of half-lives for
N = 126 nuclei is still signiﬁcant in order to determine the production of the r-process peak.

1. Introduction

The rapid neutron-capture process (r process) is one of the
major nucleosynthesis processes [1, 2], producing nuclei heav-
ier than iron, which include rare-earth elements and actinides.
The r process is considered to take place in explosive neutron-
rich environments in the universe [3, 4], e.g., core-collapse su-
pernovae (CC-SNe), which are the formation process of a neu-
tron star (NS), and/or NS–NS mergers, coalescences of binary
NSs. The realistic astrophysical scenario, however, is still un-
settled even based on recent sophisticated multi-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. On the other hand, the basic
nucleosynthesis mechanism and the required physical condi-
tions are relatively well understood. The r process consists
of multiple neutron captures (n,γ) competing with the photo-
disintegration (γ,n) and β decay, so that nucleosynthetic path
is laid down on very neutron-rich region far from the stability.
The r process has been extensively investigated based on nu-
clear reaction network calculations using simpliﬁed astrophys-
ical models [5, 6]. For a given astrophysical (hydrodynami-
cal) condition, the ﬁnal abundances are uniquely determined by
the nuclear physics properties, i.e., masses, decay half-lives, Q-
values and (n,γ) and (γ,n) cross sections (see [7] and references
therein).
The observed r-process abundance pattern1 has peaks around
A ∼ 130 and 195, which originate from waiting point nuclei

1 Several r-process-enriched metal-poor stars show solar-like r-process
abundance distribution in the Z > 60 (A > 120) region [8].
In this study,
we can safely assume the solar abundances as a typical (“universal”) r-process
pattern, because we mostly focus on heavy r-process nuclei (A > 150).

around N = 82 and 126 neutron magic numbers along the r-
process nucleosynthesis path. For nuclei with magic neutron
numbers, the neutron capture becomes inhibited and the nucle-
osynthesis ﬂow is inﬂuenced by the β decay. In addition, after
terminating the neutron capture, the ﬁnal abundances are deter-
mined by the β decay with emission of neutrons. Thus the β-
decay properties of N = 82 and 126 nuclei, which are half-lives
and corrections from β-delayed neutron emission, are impor-
tant for discussing ﬁnal abundances [9, 10]. Despite the impor-
tance, half-lives were measured for only a portion of neutron-
rich nuclei and most of the waiting point nuclei cannot be stud-
ied experimentally at the moment. In the recent years, a lot of
progress was obtained for nuclei N ∼ 82 at radioactive beam
facilities such as RIBF at RIKEN [11, 12, 13]. However, exper-
imental information is not available in N ∼ 126 region (mea-
surements are performed only near the line of stability [14]),
so that nucleosynthesis calculations have to rely on theoretical
predictions.

Theoretical prediction of β-decay half-lives has been tra-
ditionally performed by considering only allowed transitions.
The allowed β-decay transitions, which conserve parity and the
change of angular momentum is limited to 0 or 1, are domi-
nant for the majority of nuclei. This is valid for the N = 50
and 82 neutron closed shell nuclei, i.e., the previous calcula-
tions are reliable. However, in cases when a large contributions
from ﬁrst-forbidden (FF) β decay are expected, these calcula-
tions severely overestimate the lifetimes. This is signiﬁcant for
nuclei around the N = 126 waiting point, where the FF decay
can be dominant. In this mass region, the FF decay, based on

the νi13/2 → πh11/2 transition, competes with the allowed de-
cays due to the νh9/2 → πh11/2 transition. This is because the
FF decay is energetically favoured (the h9/2 neutron is deep in
the shell, while the i13/2 is much closer to the Fermi level).

Currently the most widely adopted theoretical β-decay half-
lives are based on the ﬁnite-range droplet model (FRDM) [15].
They originally included only allowed transitions [16], with FF
transitions incorporated later using the gross theory [17]. More
recently, several calculations take into account ﬁrst-forbidden β
decays by the extended quasiparticle random phase approxima-
tion (QRPA) [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and shell model approaches
[23, 24]. These studies found a signiﬁcant contribution, in
the range of 20 – 80%, of the FF transition to the β decay
for N = 126 waiting point nuclei. These calculations also
predict a large β-delayed neutron emission probability for the
N ∼ 126 r-process path nuclei, which have a high Qβ value and
low neutron separation energy. Thus, the β decay may populate
states above the neutron threshold, and neutron emission fol-
lows the decay. The neutron emission can aﬀect the r-process
ﬁnal abundances by decreasing the neutron number during the
decay phase.

In this study, we focus on the impacts of the FF β decay
and the β-delayed neutron emission on the production of the
A ∼ 195 r-process peak in several astrophysical models. We
adopt a recent magneto-rotational supernova (MR-SNe) model
[25] as well as a neutron star merger model [26] and a proto-
neutron-star wind (PNSW) model [27] that have been used in
previous studies. These astronomical models cover a range of
realistic physical conditions of the r-process environments.

2. Nuclear physics input and astrophysical models

2.1. β Decay with β-delayed neutron emission

We adopt β-decay rates calculated based on the spherical
QRPA method with realistic forces [20], “FBS13” hereafter, for
nuclei N ∼ 126. The QRPA method can handle larger model
space than the shell model. In the region of heavy nuclei, shell
model calculations are usually limited to the N = 126 isotones,
whereas FBS13 provides theoretical results on N = 124–128
nuclei. The larger model space also means that negative par-
ity FF transitions were dealt with, which are missing for some
calculations [15].

We apply the rates of β decay and β-delayed neutron emis-
sion probabilities (1n, 2n and 3n emissions) for N = 124–
128 nuclei calculated by FBS13. FBS13 uses experimental
Qβ-values and neutron-separation energies if available (as in
some cases around N = 82), otherwise, masses predicted by
the FRDM were employed [17]. Due to the diﬃculty of treating
odd-odd nuclei, we simply compute their decay rates by means
of interpolation from neighbouring nuclei. Since experiments
suggest smooth log t1/2 behaviour for neutron-rich nuclei (see,
e.g., [13]), the properties of odd-odd nuclei were calculated as:

t1/2(Z, N) = (cid:112)

Pn(Z, N) =

t1/2(Z + 1, N) × t1/2(Z − 1, N) ,
[Pn(Z + 1, N) + Pn(Z − 1, N)] ,

where t1/2 and Pn are the β-decay half-life and neutron emis-
sion probability (for 1, 2 and 3 neutron emissions) for a given
nucleus with Z and N, respectively.

For the N = 82 isotones the adopted half-lives agree well
with that of the shell model [23, 24] and with the continuum
QRPA [20]. They are also consistent with the available experi-
mental data. This is also the case for N = 80 and 84 nuclei (here
no shell model predictions exist). In the case of the N = 126
nuclei, there are no experimental data available. Here the dis-
crepancy among diﬀerent calculations is larger than at N = 82.
The half-life values used here are in agreement with the pre-
dictions of the shell model [23, 24] within a factor of two. Re-
garding the β-delayed neutron emission probabilities, Pn, there
are large diﬀerences between calculations. The calculation used
here predicts lower values than the shell model [23, 24] and the
continuum QRPA [20] for N = 82 nuclei. For N = 126 nuclei,
the diﬀerences among calculations are smaller, all predicting
large Pn ∼ 0.1–1 values for r-process path even-even nuclei.
For odd-Z nuclei, small Pn values are predicted by all calcula-
tions, with the one adopted here predicting lower values than
the others [23, 24, 20]. As a general rule, more neutron-rich
nuclei (lower Z) have a larger neutron emission probability.

The FF transitions generally play only a small role for N =
82 nuclei, where the ratio of a FF part to the total β-decay rate
is about 10%. However, FF transitions are very important for
N = 126 nuclei, the contribution of the FF component reaching
20–60%. Due to the inﬂuence of the FF transition, the half-
lives generally become shorter [17].
The general trends of the β-decay for N ∼ 126 region are il-
lustrated in Fig. 1. The left panel shows the ratio of half-lives of

hereafter), while, the right panel plots the ratio of FF transition
to the total decay rate. Comparing MPK03, FBS13 shows faster
decay half-lives in particular for Z > 60 nuclei. This is due to
the eﬀect of particle-particle residual interactions which brings
down the rates, which are ignored in MPK03 [20]. In addition,
very neutron-rich nuclei, which have a strong β-delayed neutron
n=1 nPn > 1 (i.e., more than one neutron is emitted
per decay), are marked in both panels. We will discuss the ef-
fects of these decay properties on the r-process nucleosynthesis
in Section 3.

2.2. Nuclear reaction networks

We perform nucleosynthesis calculations using a nuclear re-
action network code, described in [12, 25, 28]. This code con-
sists of more than 4000 isotopes of Z ≤ 100. All nuclear reac-
tions and decay relevant to the r process are taken into account,
and ﬁssion for heavy nuclei is also included. For nuclei exper-
imental masses [29] are not available, we adopt theoretical val-
ues based on FRDM. Theoretical rates, e.g., (n,γ) and β-decay,
are taken from REACLIB [30] and JINA Reaclib [31].
Focusing on β decay for N ∼ 126 (N = 124–128) nuclei,
we make ﬁve diﬀerent networks summarised in Table 1. Most
of theoretical β-decay rates for thousands neutron-rich nuclei
are taken from “base” data, while we modify the decay rate for
N ∼ 126 nuclei. The ﬁrst two cases are standard, widely used
in nucleosynthesis calculations. MNK97 (named “FRDM” in
[12]) includes only β decay due to allowed transitions and ig-
nores β-delayed neutron emission. MPK03 includes these ef-
fects, calculated with the gross theory of the β decay [17].
FBS13 uses β decay half-lives and β-delayed neutron emission
probabilities calculated for N = 124–128 nuclei [20], as de-
scribed in Section 2.1. All other nuclear rates are the same as
the MPK03 network.
FBS13 is a state-of-the-art calculation focusing on FF tran-
sitions and β-delayed neutron emission around N ∼ 126.
Therefore, we adopt these calculations to investigate the ef-
fects of these ingredients on the A ∼ 195 r-process abundance
peak. Consequently, we also prepare two additional networks
based on FBS. As listed in Table 1, we add FBS(w/o FF) and
FBS(w/o n.e.) networks, in which we ignore the eﬀect of
FF in decay rates and neutron emission, respectively. These
are artiﬁcially modiﬁed rates for N ∼ 126 isotones, where
FBS(w/o FF) has longer half-lives (slower decay) than FBS,

and FBS(w/o n.e.) simply ignores neutron emission. Conse-
quently, these additional networks are physically invalid and
will be used only for examining the role of individual physical
processes (in Section 3).

2.3. Astrophysical models

We calculated the r process nucleosynthesis based on sev-
eral astrophysical conditions (i.e., the density, temperature and
electron fraction Ye or initial composition). We adopted the jet-
like explosion of magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SNe) as
a ﬁducial case, providing medium neutron-rich (Ye ∼ 0.1–0.3)
environments and relatively low entropies ∼ 10 kB baryon−1.
We use an energetic jet-like explosion model with strong eﬀects
of rotation and magnetic ﬁelds, classiﬁed as “prompt-magnetic-
jets” [33]. The details of the nucleosynthesis are described

in [25], and the role in the chemical evolution is discussed in
[34].

We also calculate nucleosynthesis for a proto-neutron star
wind (PNSW) model, which is slightly neutron-rich with signif-
icantly higher entropies ∼ 100kB baryon−1. We adopt a trajec-
tory from 1D hydrodynamical calculations of 15M(cid:12) progenitor
(model r15-l1-r1 of [27]). We assume Ye = 0.3 with an orig-
inal hydrodynamical evolution of the temperature and density
(S ∼ 165 kB). In addition, we also calculate r process using the
trajectory of a neutron star merger (NS–NS) model, based on
a hydrodynamical simulation [26]. The physical properties of
ejecta for NS–NS mergers is still unsettled, where previous sim-
ulations have shown extremely neutron-rich Ye < 0.1 environ-
ments with strong eﬀect of ﬁssion-cycling. We assume that the
main ejecta has Ye > 0.1, based on a more recent treatment of
the ejecta by shock-heated ejection mechanism [35, 36], where
weak interaction is activated, and the Ye is considerably higher
than 0.1. We select a trajectory with Ye = 0.14 that produces
r-process nuclei including the N = 126 peak.

3. Results

We performed nucleosynthesis calculations using diﬀerent β-
decay rates for the N ∼ 126 nuclei, as summarised in Table 1.
The abundance of the MR-SN model based on the two stan-
dard nuclear physics inputs are shown in Fig. 2(a). The global
features of abundance patterns in the entire r-process elements
are similar, and the abundances of A < 180 nuclei are almost
identical. However, the abundances around the r-process third
peak at A ∼ 195 are diﬀerent. Fig. 2(b) focuses on this A ∼ 195
abundance peak. The results of FBS13 are also included.

The peak of FBS13 shifts to the higher mass number and it
is wider compared with both MPK03 and MNK97 which are
based on FRDM calculations. The shift of the peak is simply
understood by the diﬀerence of β-decay timescales. Shorter de-
cay half-lives aid the production of heavier nuclei, because the
β decay determines the progress of the r process around the
waiting point nuclei (as already investigated [17, 37, 21, 22]).

MPK03 has shorter half-lives than MNK97 owing to the inclu-
sion of FF transitions. FBS13 also includes FF transitions and
its half-lives are generally shorter than those of MPK03 for the
r-process path nuclei due to the eﬀects of particle-particle resid-
ual interactions [20] (see also the left panel of Fig. 1).
The impact of half-lives for N ∼ 126 also clearly ap-
pears in Fig. 2(c) by the comparison of MNK97 and its vari-
ation. MNK97-0.5β has shorter half-lives multiplied by 0.5 and
MNK97-2.0β has longer half-lives by 2.0, respectively. For
solid lines, we artiﬁcially change the half-lives for N = 124–
128 nuclei and we only modiﬁed N = 126 isotones for dashed
lines. Here, abundances of each solid line are similar to the
ones of corresponding dashed line. This is understood as the
“r-process path” in Fig. 1 is mostly on the N = 126, and the
half-lives of N = 126 isotones are dominant for determining
the progress of the r process.

We examine the eﬀects of individual physical processes, i.e.,
the FF-transitions to β decay and neutron emission by compar-
ing the reaction network of FBS13 and its sub-networks. The
results of the calculations are shown in Fig. 3 for the three as-
trophysical models (i.e., the MR-SN, PNSW and NS merger).
The FBS(w/o FF) network uses longer β-decay half-lives, as
we ignored the decay components due to the FF transitions. In
all the cases, the peak of FBS13 is located at larger mass num-
ber compared with the FBS(w/o FF). This feature is valid to
all models, although the merger model has smaller impacts in
A > 195 region than MR-SN and PNSW. This is due to the
strong progress of neutron captures with fast expansion, which
locates the r-process path at very neutron-rich region. Shifting
the peak to higher mass numbers is naturally understood by the
shorter half-lives of FBS13 compared with FBS(w/o FF). This
is consistent with the results in Fig. 2, that shorter β-decay half-
lives support production of heavier elements.

The other sub-network FBS(w/o n.e.) uses the same decay
rates (half-lives) as FBS13, but we artiﬁcially ignored the ef-
fects of β-delayed neutron emission. We ﬁnd two character-
istics in the abundance patterns: (i) the inclusion of neutron
emission shifts the lower end of the A ∼ 195 abundance peak to

physical models; (ii) neutron emission washes out the odd-even

neutron emitted on average,(cid:80)3

Nuclei with high neutron emission numbers (more than one
n=1 nPn > 1) are marked by “×”
in Fig. 1. Nuclei on the r-process path have signiﬁcant neu-
tron emission probability and they are higher for nuclei further
from stability (e.g., lower Z with N = 126). Consequently neu-
tron emission widens the ﬁnal abundance pattern in the direc-
tion of lower A. This widening is dependent on the astrophysi-
cal model. Models in which the r-process path passes through
higher Z nuclei, such as the MR-SN (see Fig. 1), the higher
mass end of the abundance peak is hardly aﬀected, and only
the lower end shifts to lower masses. This causes a signiﬁcant
broadening of the peak. In contrast, in the merger model the
r-process path lies further from stability, and the neutron emis-
sion moves the whole abundance peak to lower A. We note that
the strength of neutron emission is higher for odd Z nuclei than
for even Z ones (for more details, see [20]). This asymmetry
changes the path of the decay ﬂow and the even-odd mass scat-
tering in the abundance peak.

Finally, we examine the role of β delayed neutrons and
FF transitions by describing the time evolution of the neutron
density. The temporal evolution of the neutron-to-seed ratio
(n/seed, the ratio of the neutron number density to the seed nu-
clei) is shown in Fig. 4. The choice of networks and astrophys-
ical models is the same as Fig. 3.
In all three astrophysical
scenarios, the inclusion of the FF transitions (shorter β-decay
half-lives) reduces the time window with large n/seed, therefore
reducing the timescale of the neutron capture phase of the r pro-
cess. The eﬀect is the largest for the merger and smallest for
the MR-SN model. On the other hand, the β-delayed neutron
emission slightly increases the n/seed. The increase is, how-
ever, small to aﬀect heavy element production. The β-delayed
neutron emission mostly has impacts to form the N ∼ 126 peak
during β-decay phase, as shown in Fig. 3.

4. Conclusion

[20] based on three astrophysical scenarios. The reached con-
clusions are general, and are independent of the chosen nuclear
physics input calculation. We found the following impacts on
the production of the A = 195 r-process abundance peak:

• The inclusion of the ﬁrst-forbidden β decay leads to faster
progress of the r process for the waiting-point nuclei. This
is mostly caused by the shorter β-decay half-lives of the
N ∼ 126 nuclei. This shifts the A ∼ 195 peak towards
higher masses and results in slightly wider distribution.

• The delayed neutron emission widens the abundance peak
in the direction of smaller neutron number, modifying its
lower mass tail. The asymmetry of neutron emission prob-
ability between the odd and even Z nuclei smoothens the
ﬁnal abundances during the decay phase.

These characteristics are commonly seen in the all adopted as-
trophysical models (i.e., MR-SN, NS–NS merger and PNSW
models), although the size of the eﬀects depend on physical
conditions and details of the nuclear physics inputs.

The theoretical uncertainty of β-decay properties is still large,
as the relevant nuclei in the N = 126 region are presently be-
yond the reach of experiments. For example a recent calcu-
lation in the Ni region [38] implies that the particle-vibration
coupling eﬀect beyond QRPA could shift the Gamow-Teller
strength downwards energetically, which increases the decay
rates and reduces the ratios of the FF part of the total decay. In
the future, improved evaluations of the ratios of FF to Gamow-
Teller contributions would take into account these eﬀects be-
yond QRPA. The production of the A ∼ 195 peak is also af-
fected by ﬁssion including neutron emission [22], as well as
β-decay half-lives. In order to reduce uncertainty in nucleosyn-
thesis calculations, complete knowledge about decay properties
for very neutron-rich nuclei is essential. We absolutely need
experimental information on the waiting point nuclei. Exper-
iments for the measurement of N = 126 nuclei are progress-
ing, with plans to produce these nuclei in both deep-inelastic
[39, 40] and fragmentation reactions [41].

We studied the role of ﬁrst-forbidden β decay and that of the
β-delayed neutron emission on the r process, speciﬁcally the
eﬀect on the A ∼ 195 peak. We used the state-of-the-art cal-
culations of β-decay rates and neutron emission probabilities
