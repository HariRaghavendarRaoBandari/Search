ABSTRACT

Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are suggested to be acceleration sites of cosmic rays in the Galaxy.
While the magnetic ﬁeld plays an important role in the acceleration process, previous observations
of magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations of PWNe are rare, particularly for evolved systems. We present a
radio polarization study of the “Snail” PWN inside the supernova remnant G327.1−1.1 using the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. This PWN is believed to have been recently crushed by the
supernova (SN) reverse shock. The radio morphology is composed of a main circular body with a
ﬁnger-like protrusion. We detected a strong linear polarization signal from the emission, which reﬂects
a highly ordered magnetic ﬁeld in the PWN and is in contrast to the turbulent environment with a
tangled magnetic ﬁeld generally expected from hydrodynamical simulations. This could suggest that
the characteristic turbulence scale is larger than the radio beam size. We built a toy model to explore
this possibility, and found that a simulated PWN with a turbulence scale of about one-eighth to
one-sixth of the nebula radius and a pulsar wind ﬁlling factor of 50–75% provides the best match to
observations. This implies substantial mixing between the SN ejecta and pulsar wind material in this
system.

INTRODUCTION

A massive star ends its life as a supernova (SN) explo-
sion. This leaves behind a supernova remnant (SNR) and
sometimes creates a rapidly rotating pulsar. A pulsar
can produce an outﬂow of a magnetic ﬁeld and relativis-
tic particles referred to as a pulsar wind. The interaction
between such a pulsar wind and the ambient medium, i.e.
the SN ejecta for pulsars embedded in SNRs, results in a
termination shock, beyond which the shocked wind ma-
terials inﬂate a broadband synchrotron-emitting bubble
known as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN).

The evolution of PWNe can be divided into several
stages (see Blondin et al. 2001; van der Swaluw et al.
2001, 2004; Gelfand et al. 2009). A PWN ﬁrst expands
supersonically inside its associated SNR. The next stage
starts when the SN reverse shock, which is driven inward
by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar
medium, crushes the PWN. The interplay between the
shockwave and the PWN is complex and will cause the
PWN to reverberate (e.g. van der Swaluw et al. 2001).
After the eﬀect of the reverse shock fades away, the PWN
will expand subsonically into the SNR. Since a pulsar is

generally born with high space velocity, it can be signif-
icantly oﬀ-centered with respect to the SNR during the
reverberation stage and can protrude from its own PWN
because of the reverse shock interaction (van der Swaluw
et al. 2004). This can result in a complicated PWN mor-
phology consisting of a “relic” component and an elon-
gated “head” bridging between the relic and the pulsar
(van der Swaluw et al. 2004). As the pulsar continues to
travel toward the edge of the SNR, its motion will even-
tually become supersonic because the local sound speed
in an SNR decreases moving outward. The ram pressure
acting on the pulsar wind due to the pulsar’s supersonic
motion will deform the PWN into a bow shock. For even
older systems, the pulsar can escape from its associated
SNR shell and drive a bow-shock PWN into the inter-
stellar medium.

Broadband emission from PWNe can be observed from
the radio to γ-rays. In the radio regime, a PWN emits
through the synchrotron process, and the emission is of-
ten highly linear polarized because of the ordered mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration. A radio PWN is characterized
by a centrally ﬁlled morphology and a ﬂat spectrum, with
a spectral index of −0.3 ≤ α ≤ 0 (Sν ∝ να). The syn-
chrotron spectrum can extend to the X-ray band where
the spectrum is usually steeper than that in the radio
due to synchrotron cooling. GeV and TeV γ-ray emis-
sion from PWNe has also been detected, which is due to
inverse-Compton scattering (see the review by Gaensler
& Slane 2006).

One interesting area to explore in the study of PWNe
is the interaction with the SN reverse shocks. Theoret-
ically, hydrodynamical (HD) modeling shows that the
interplay can give rise to turbulence in PWNe (Blondin
et al. 2001; van der Swaluw et al. 2004). However, the
role of the magnetic ﬁeld is unclear since magnetohy-
drodynamic (MHD) eﬀorts are lacking. Observationally,

we aim to probe the magnetic ﬁeld structure of these
PWNe to expand the currently inadequate sample size.
The results from our study can serve as inputs to MHD
modeling.
One of the few examples of such systems is G327.1−1.1,
which is an SNR system containing a PWN that is be-
lieved to have been recently crushed by the reverse shock.
It was discovered as a non-thermal radio source (Clark
et al. 1973, 1975). Its peculiar radio morphology was re-
vealed by the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope
(MOST) SNR survey (Whiteoak & Green 1996). The
SNR shell is 17(cid:48) in diameter and contains an oﬀ-centered
PWN. The latter consists of a circular main body with a
3(cid:48) diameter together with a 2(cid:48)-long ﬁnger-like structure
protruding northwest from the main body.
The ﬁrst X-ray detection of G327.1−1.1 was reported
by Lamb & Markert (1981) using the Einstein Observa-
tory. Further X-ray studies were conducted with ROSAT
(Seward et al. 1996; Sun et al. 1999), ASCA (Sun et al.
1999), BeppoSAX (Bocchino & Bandiera 2003), Chandra
(Temim et al. 2009, 2015), and XMM-Newton (Temim
et al. 2009). The X-ray remnant consists of a diﬀuse
thermal component covering the radio shell and a non-
thermal component coinciding with the radio PWN. An
X-ray compact source at the tip of the ﬁnger was dis-
covered along with two prong-like structures extending
northwest from the ﬁnger into a diﬀuse, arc-like struc-
ture (Temim et al. 2009, 2015). The compact source
is interpreted as the neutron star powering the PWN,
but the nature of the prongs and the arc is not well un-
derstood. Sun et al. (1999) estimated the distance to
G327.1−1.1 to be d = 9.0 kpc based on an empirical re-
lationship between the X-ray column density NH and the
color excess E(B − V ), and the observed relationship be-
tween E(B−V ) and the distance d along the line of sight
to G327.1−1.1. We will adopt this number (d = 9.0 kpc)
in our analysis.
In γ-rays, a preliminary report of TeV detection of
G327.1−1.1 with H.E.S.S. was described by Acero et al.
(2012). As the photon index in TeV was found to be simi-
lar to that in keV, they suggested that the emission in the
two bands could originate from the same population of
particles through inverse-Compton and synchrotron pro-
cesses, respectively. This source has not been detected in
the GeV range by Fermi LAT (Acero et al. 2013, 2015).
By considering the current position of the presumed
neutron star relative to the SN shell, Temim et al. (2009)
suggested that the neutron star is moving northward.
The main body of the PWN is interpreted as the relic,
and the overall PWN morphology could be caused by the
reverse shock ﬁrst crushing the PWN from the northwest,
thus pushing the relic to the southeast. The asymme-
try of the reverse shock interaction is attributed to both
the inhomogeneous ambient interstellar medium and the
pulsar’s motion. This picture is supported by recent HD
simulations (Temim et al. 2015). It is believed that the
PWN has not yet evolved into the bow-shock stage (van
der Swaluw et al. 2004; Temim et al. 2009, 2015).
In this paper, we present radio observations of the
PWN in G327.1−1.1 with the Australia Telescope Com-
pact Array (ATCA). We obtained polarimetric measure-
ments at 6 and 3 cm to investigate the magnetic ﬁeld
structure of the PWN. The observations and data reduc-
tion procedures are described in Section 2. We show the

results in Section 3 and discuss our ﬁndings in Section 4.
We close by summarizing our work in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Radio observations of the PWN in G327.1−1.1 were
performed with ATCA at 6 and 3 cm on 2008 Decem-
ber 09 and 2009 February 19 with array conﬁgurations
of 750B and EW352, respectively. The observation pa-
rameters are listed in Table 1. All of the observations
were carried out prior to the Compact Array Broadband
Backend (CABB) upgrade (Wilson et al. 2011). The data
were taken in continuum mode with all four Stokes pa-
rameters recorded over a usable bandwidth of 104 MHz
at each frequency. We observed for a total integration
time of 20.8 hr in each band as a ﬁve-pointing mosaic.
PKS B1934−638 was adopted as the primary calibrator
to set the ﬂux density scale, and PKS 1613−586 was ob-
served at 20 minute intervals to determine the antenna
gain solution. We also processed archival ATCA pre-
CABB data at 20 and 13 cm, for which the observation
parameters are also listed in Table 1. The 13 cm observa-
tions were performed in continuum mode with the same
usable bandwidth of 104 MHz. However, the 20 cm ob-
servations were performed in spectral line mode on the
H i line, such that only the total intensity (i.e. no po-
larization) within a narrow usable bandwidth of 4 MHz
was recorded. The simultaneous observations at 20 and
13 cm consist of a single pointing at G327.1−1.1, with
array conﬁgurations of 1.5D and 750D for a total inte-
gration time of 19.0 hr per band. PKS B1934−638 was
also used as the primary calibrator for these two bands,
and PKS 1610−771 was observed every 45 minutes for
antenna gain calibration.

We used the MIRIAD package (Sault et al. 1995) for all
of the data reduction. First, edge channels and channels
known to be aﬀected by radio frequency interference were
discarded. We then examined the data and ﬂagged bad
data points during periods of poor atmospheric stability.
Next, bandpass, gain, polarization, and ﬂux calibration
solutions were determined. In order to obtain a uniform
u-v coverage, we excluded data from the 6 km baseline
while forming radio maps. We formed radio images for
the four bands, adopting the multifrequency synthesis
technique (Sault & Wieringa 1994) which can further
improve the u-v coverage. In particular, the 20 cm con-
tinuum image was formed by extracting line-free channels
from the data. Uniform weighting was used for the 20,
13, and 6 cm images to reduce sidelobes and to improve
the spatial resolution. For the 3 cm image, due to the
lower signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in this band, we used a
weighting parameter of robust = 0 (Briggs 1995) to op-
timize the balance between the noise level and spatial res-
olution. We then applied a maximum entropy algorithm
(Gull & Daniell 1978) to deconvolve all of the dirty maps.
For 20 and 13 cm, the task MAXEN was employed; for 6 and
3 cm, we used the task PMOSMEM (Sault et al. 1999) to de-
convolve the Stokes I, Q, and U maps simultaneously.
After that, we convolved the resultant models with syn-
thesized beams of FWHM 26(cid:48)(cid:48) × 19(cid:48)(cid:48) for 20 cm, 16(cid:48)(cid:48) × 11(cid:48)(cid:48)
for 13 cm, 15(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48)(cid:48) for 6 cm, and 10(cid:48)(cid:48) × 8(cid:48)(cid:48) for 3 cm.
The ﬁnal maps have an rms noise of 0.44 mJy beam−1 at
20 cm, 0.085 mJy beam−1 at 13 cm, 0.15 mJy beam−1 at
6 cm, and 0.11 mJy beam−1 at 3 cm. These all agree well
with the theoretical values. We also formed images with

visibilities from the 6 km baselines only in an attempt
to identify point sources. Identical data reduction and
imaging procedures as above were used, except that nat-
ural weighting was used to form the images in order to
reduce the noise.

For polarimetry, we formed a new set of low-resolution
3 cm images matching that at 6 cm in order to make a
direct comparison between the two bands and generate a
rotation measure (RM) map (see Section 3.4). A Gaus-
sian taper has been applied to the visibility data by set-
ting the parameter of FWHM = 15, 13 in the task INVERT.
We then followed the same imaging and cleaning proce-
dures as outlined above, except we convolved the output
model of the task PMOSMEM with a Gaussian beam of iden-
tical size as the 6 cm beam (FWHM = 15(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48)(cid:48)) in the
task RESTOR. We obtained polarized intensity and polar-
ization position angle (PA) maps from the Stokes Q and
U maps at the two bands. The Ricean bias was corrected
for when the polarized intensity was computed (Wardle
& Kronberg 1974). We blanked out areas where either
the polarized intensity has S/N < 5 or the total intensity
has S/N < 12. Note that polarization was not measured
at 20 cm and the 13 cm data are not useful, since the
Stokes Q and U maps are corrupted by severe polariza-
tion leakage from a nearby bright H ii region G327.3−0.6.
This is due to a ﬂaw in the feedhorn design of the old
ATCA receiver8.

For the H i data, we used the task UVLIN to separate
line emission from continuum emission within the 20 cm
data. We then smoothed the line spectrum to a reso-
lution of 3.3 km s−1 in velocity. To ﬁlter out large-scale
structures, only data with u-v distances shorter than 1 kλ
were selected to form the line images. We found that the
source is too weak to determine any H i absorption.

3.1. PWN Morphology

A composite radio image of SNR G327.1−1.1 at 36 cm
(MOST; Whiteoak & Green 1996) and 6 cm (ATCA) is
shown in Figure 1a, featuring both the SNR shell and
the PWN. Radio intensity maps of the PWN at 20, 13,
6, and 3 cm (all from ATCA) are shown in Figure 2.
The nebula exhibits similar morphology over the ob-
served wavelengths.
It has a main circular structure
with a diameter of ∼ 4(cid:48) and a ﬁnger-like structure of
length ∼ 1.(cid:48)5 protruding toward the northwest. Together
with the two X-ray prongs ahead of the radio ﬁnger, the
whole PWN resembles a snail. We thus refer to the en-
tire PWN as “the Snail”: the circular structure is the
“body” and the protrusion is the “head.” A more de-
tailed look at the body revealed two features — “the
bay” to the southwest and “the apex” to the northwest
(see Figure 3). The bay is an indented area to the body,
while the apex is a sharp corner at the body’s boundary.
Faint emission is detected outside of the bay at 20 and
6 cm (about 13.8 mJy beam−1 and 2.5 mJy beam−1, re-
spectively), and was also found in the MOST image (Sun
et al. 1999). The emission is not obvious in the 13 and
3 cm images. This could be attributed to the contamina-
tion of the 13 cm image by the SNR, while at 3 cm it could
be too faint to be detected, or could have been resolved
out because of insuﬃcient u-v coverage (see Section 3.2).
On a larger scale, hints of an SNR shell of diameter ∼ 17(cid:48)
are seen in the 20 and 13 cm images (not shown in the
ﬁeld of view of Figure 2). Since the shortest baseline
of the 6 and 3 cm observations is 31 m, which translates

are from the 6 cm intensity map, with contour levels set at 2.2, 4,
and 8 mJy beam−1. The cross marks the position of the X-ray
point source. The restoring beam at 6 cm is shown in the lower left
corner. The eastern point source can be seen more clearly in the
3 cm image in Figure 2.

to angular scales of about 7(cid:48) and 4(cid:48), respectively, we do
not expect these observations to be sensitive to the SNR
shell.

The 13, 6, and 3 cm images clearly reveal small-
scale structure within the body. We discovered ﬁla-
ments running through the PWN with an unresolved
width by our observations. These ﬁlaments seem to
form loop-like structures that are typically ∼ 1(cid:48) di-

ameter. There are two point sources near the north-
ern edge of the body. The eastern one is located at
(15h54m45s, −55◦03(cid:48)39(cid:48)(cid:48); J2000.0) and the western one is
at (15h54m41s, −55◦03(cid:48)55(cid:48)(cid:48); J2000.0). These are marked
in Figure 3. Both point sources are unresolved in the
6 km baseline images, and therefore are less than 1(cid:48)(cid:48) in
extent.
The head has an extent of about 1.(cid:48)5 long and 0.(cid:48)4 wide,
and shows uniform surface brightness (∼ 7 mJy beam−1
at 6 cm, and ∼ 2 mJy beam−1 at 3 cm), except near
the tip (15h54m25.4s, −55◦04(cid:48)01.3(cid:48)(cid:48); J2000.0) where it
shows a peak with ∼ 9 mJy beam−1 at 6 cm and ∼
3 mJy beam−1 at 3 cm. The radio peak is extended, with
a size of ∼ 34(cid:48)(cid:48) × 18(cid:48)(cid:48) elongated along the head, and is
oﬀset from the X-ray point source by ∼ 18(cid:48)(cid:48) to the south-
east. No radio counterparts of the X-ray prongs and arc
outside of the head are detected. Careful examination of
the 6 km baseline images shows no counterparts of the
X-ray point source with a 3σ upper limit of 1.1 mJy at
6 cm.

3.2. Radio Spectrum

To measure the PWN ﬂux density, we employed a
source region enclosing both the body and the head as
shown in Figure 2. The eastern point source is believed
to be a background source while the western point source
might be a compact structure within the PWN (see Sec-
tion 4.1.5). Therefore, we deﬁned a circular exclusion
region of 43(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter centered at the former. We tried
diﬀerent background regions within the SNR shell, and
the diﬀerence gives us a handle on the systematic uncer-
tainty. The results are shown in Table 2. The ﬂux densi-
ties of the PWN are 2.3± 0.2 Jy, 2.1± 0.4 Jy, 1.8± 0.3 Jy,
1.5 ± 0.2 Jy, and 0.94 ± 0.06 Jy at 36, 20, 13, 6, and
3 cm, respectively. The uncertainties are dominated by
the systematic uncertainties associated with background
subtraction, as the statistical uncertainties are relatively
small (a few mJy). We note that the value we ﬁnd at
36 cm (2.3 Jy) is slightly larger than that (2.0 Jy) re-
ported by Whiteoak & Green (1996). This could be at-
tributed to our diﬀerent choice of regions.

The radio spectrum is shown in Figure 4. Fitting the
ﬂux densities at 36, 20, 13, and 6 cm with a power law
(Sν ∝ να) gives a spectral index of α = −0.3 ± 0.1, and
extrapolation to 3 cm suggests a ﬂux density of 1.3 Jy,
which is almost 40% higher than the observed value of
0.94 Jy. If we directly join the 6 and 3 cm data points,
then we obtain α = −0.8 ± 0.2 between the two bands.
The shortest u-v spacing at 3 cm is about 0.8 kλ, corre-
sponding to an angular scale of 4.(cid:48)3. This sets a rough
upper limit on the size of structures that our observa-
tions are sensitive to. In order to see if the missing ﬂux
problem is signiﬁcant, we formed a 6 cm radio image only
with u-v distance larger than 0.8 kλ, using identical pro-
cedure as described in Section 2. This results in about
20% loss in ﬂux density of the PWN, suggesting that the
3 cm observations may not be sensitive to the larger-scale
emission of the PWN.

We also determined the ﬂux densities of the body and
the head of the Snail separately, with the results also
listed in Table 2. The ﬂux densities and ﬁtted spectra
are shown in Figure 4. For the body, the ﬂux densities
are 2.1 ± 0.1 Jy, 1.8 ± 0.4 Jy, 1.5 ± 0.2 Jy, 1.3 ± 0.1 Jy,

entire PWN, the body, and the head are marked by black closed
diamonds, red open circles, and blue closed squares, respectively.
The best ﬁts to the three spectra give spectral indices of α =

α = −0.3 ± 0.1. For the head, the ﬂux densities are
0.18±0.02 Jy, 0.30±0.06 Jy, 0.23±0.03 Jy, 0.16±0.02 Jy,
and 0.11± 0.01 Jy at 36, 20, 13, 6, and 3 cm, respectively.
The spectrum of the head appears to be peculiar, as the
observed ﬂux density is lower at 36 cm than that at 20 cm.
We believe that the ﬂux density measurement of the head
could be aﬀected by faint sidelobes from G327.3−0.6 at
36 cm. We ﬁtted the ﬂux densities of the head between
20 and 3 cm, as the size of the head is only about 1.(cid:48)5 long
and 0.(cid:48)4 wide, and should be well sampled by our 3 cm
observations. The resulting power-law spectrum has a
spectral index of α = −0.6 ± 0.1.
The ﬂux densities of the eastern point source are found
to be ∼ 2.0 mJy at 6 cm and ∼ 3.3 mJy at 3 cm, while
those for the western point source are ∼ 11 mJy at 6 cm
and ∼ 7.5 mJy at 3 cm. These are very rough estimates,

overestimated (see Section 3.3).

as the diﬀuse emission from the PWN precludes precise
measurements. The results suggest an inverted spectrum
with α ∼ +0.9 for the eastern point source and α ∼ −0.7
for the western point source.

3.3. Polarization

Maps of the polarization fraction of the Snail at 6 and
3 cm are shown in Figure 5. Overall, the PWN is highly
linearly polarized. The typical polarization fraction of
the body is about 15% and 20% at 6 and 3 cm, respec-
tively, while that along the head is correspondingly about
20% and 30%. At a smaller scale, we found a highly po-
larized core inside the body as enclosed by an inner con-
tour in Figure 5, with polarization fractions of about 30%
and 40% at 6 and 3 cm, respectively. Near the northern
edge of the body, the eastern point source is unpolarized,
while the western point source is about 10% polarized at
both bands. Note that the actual polarization fraction
at 3 cm could be lower due to the missing ﬂux problem as
mentioned. Finally, the polarization fraction at the edge
of the body may be overestimated because we have used
only a single RMS value for the debiasing procedure.

where χ6 and χ3 are the observed PAs in the respec-
tive bands, and λ6 and λ3 are the center wavelengths
of the bands. The resulting RM map is shown in Fig-
ure 6, and the RM is found to vary smoothly between
−800 and 0 rad m−2 across the PWN with a typical un-
certainty of 25 rad m−2. The average RM value is about
−380 rad m−2.

One problem of determining the RM this way is the so-
called nπ ambiguity. This ambiguity arises because an
RM of larger magnitude can also be compatible with the
observed polarization vectors if it provides an addition
of multiples of π radian to the relative rotation between
the two bands. For example, adding an extra RM of
−2 can rotate the polarization vectors at 6 and
1160 rad m
3 cm by π radian relative to each other. In order to eradi-
cate this problem, we picked the ﬁrst and last channels of
the 6 cm data, which are at frequencies of 4848 MHz and
4752 MHz, respectively, and formed PA maps separately
using procedures identical to those of the full-band data.
By applying the PA maps, we generated an RM map
from the two channels. Because the individual pixels of
the RM map have large uncertainty, we did not attempt
to investigate the spatial distribution of the RM from it.
Instead, we averaged the RM across the entire PWN to
boost the S/N ratio, and found an average RM for the
Snail of −380 rad m
−2 from the two channels, which is
identical to the value obtained above. Since we expect
the rotation of the PA within the 6 cm band to be small
(less than π radian, otherwise the bandwidth depolariza-
tion would have been signiﬁcant), this rules out the nπ
ambiguity in our measurements.

3.5. Intrinsic Magnetic Field Orientation

We employed the RM map obtained from Section 3.4
to derotate the polarization vectors at 6 and 3 cm in or-
der to infer the intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld orientation of the
PWN. Since the RM was derived from the PAs at 6 and

3 cm only, the derotated vectors at the two bands have
identical orientation. The derotated vectors have a typi-
cal uncertainty of about 3◦, contributed by both the error
in PA and in RM. Figure 7 shows the projected intrin-
sic magnetic ﬁeld orientation of the Snail. Overall, the
ﬁeld is highly ordered. The magnetic ﬁeld at the head
aligns with the PWN elongation, while for the body it
is tangential to the boundary, except at the apex where
it becomes radial. The ﬁeld conﬁguration of the interior
of the body is complex with the magnetic ﬁeld generally
following the ﬁlamentary loops.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. PWN Structure and Magnetic Field Geometry

4.1.1. Overall PWN

The Snail is believed to have ﬁrst encountered the re-
verse shock about 10 kyr ago, as suggested by HD simu-
lations (Temim et al. 2015). This could have resulted in
a turbulent environment in the PWN and given rise to
a tangled magnetic ﬁeld geometry. The strong polariza-
tion signal we found from the Snail indicates the presence
of a highly ordered magnetic ﬁeld. This could reﬂect a
turbulence scale larger than the beam size of our obser-
vations.
In this case, the beam depolarization will be
insigniﬁcant and the observed magnetic ﬁeld geometry
will appear ordered at small scales. For further investi-
gation, MHD eﬀorts are required to fully understand the
highly ordered magnetic ﬁeld found in the Snail.

4.1.2. The Head

The magnetic ﬁeld in the head of the Snail shows good
alignment with the elongation of the structure (see Fig-
ure 7). This is consistent with the evolutionary picture
suggested by Temim et al. (2009), assuming that the
magnetic ﬁeld lines are frozen in the newly generated pul-
sar wind being pushed to the southeast. Similar magnetic
ﬁeld geometry is also found in some bow-shock PWNe,
including the “handle” of the Frying Pan (G315.78−0.23;
Ng et al. 2012) and the tail of the Mouse (G359.23−0.82;
Yusef-Zadeh & Gaensler 2005). However, a distinctly
diﬀerent example is the bow-shock system G319.9−0.7,
which shows a helical magnetic ﬁeld which then aligns
with the ﬂow further downstream (Ng et al. 2010). The
cause of such a peculiar conﬁguration is not well under-
stood, though it may be related to the Mach number of
the pulsar with respect to its ambient medium or the
relative inclination of the spin axis and the elongation
of the PWN (e.g., Ng et al. 2010, 2012). As the head
of the Snail is believed to be a non-bow-shock system
(i.e. the Mach number of the neutron star < 1; van der
Swaluw et al. 2004; Temim et al. 2009, 2015), it serves as
an example showing that magnetic ﬁeld can align with
subsonic comet-like PWNe.

We also compare the ﬁeld geometry around the pre-
sumed pulsar with those of a few evolved PWNe, in-
cluding Vela X (Bock et al. 1998; Dodson et al. 2003),
the Boomerang (G106.6+2.9; Kothes et al. 2006), and
DA 495 (G65.7+1.2; Kothes et al. 2008). These PWNe
could also have been crushed by the reverse shocks. The
Boomerang and DA 495 have diameters of about 1 pc and
4 pc, respectively. They are considerably smaller than

8

Ma et al.

the Snail, which has a length of the head spanning 4 pc
and the diameter of the body stretching 10 pc. The radio
polarimetric observation of Vela X (Dodson et al. 2003)
only covered the immediate vicinity (∼ 0.4 pc) around
the Vela pulsar. In the Boomerang and Vela X, toroidal
magnetic ﬁelds can be observed, while in DA 495 it was
suggested to present a toroidal component superimposed
on the apparently dipolar ﬁeld structure. The magnetic
ﬁeld structures in these three PWNe could be driven by
the pulsar itself (Dodson et al. 2003; Kothes et al. 2006,
2008), while in the head of the Snail the magnetic ﬁeld
lines parallel to the nebulae elongation can be shaped by
the passage of the reverse shock. Note that the phys-
ical scale for which we have resolution of in the Snail
is very diﬀerent from that of the three presented above.
Future high-resolution studies may potentially probe the
pulsar-driven ﬁeld near the presumed pulsar of the Snail.

4.1.3. Filaments in the Body

The high spatial resolution ATCA images in Figure 2
revealed the ﬁlamentary structure inside the PWN. The
ﬁlamentary loops generally align with the magnetic ﬁeld
(see Figure 7), suggesting that they could be magnetic
loops similar to those observed in young PWNe 3C 58
(Slane et al. 2004) and G54.1+0.3 (Lang et al. 2010). In
the Snail, the ﬁlamentary loops have a typical diameter
of ∼ 1(cid:48), which corresponds to 2.6 pc at a distance of
9 kpc. The scale is a few times larger than those in 3C 58
and G54.1+0.3, which were estimated to have diameters
of about 0.3–0.5 pc and 0.5–0.9 pc, respectively (Slane
et al. 2004; Lang et al. 2010). It was suggested that kink
instabilities can be the origin of magnetic loops in PWNe
— the toroidal ﬁeld near the termination shock could
be torn away and eventually become a magnetic loop as
observed (Slane et al. 2004). However, it is unclear if
the interaction of the SNR reverse shock could destroy
these structures. In this case, the loops would be formed
through another mechanism.

4.1.4. The Apex and the Bay

We identiﬁed two structures of the Snail near the edge
of the body referred to as the apex and the bay. The
former could be a protrusion from the body, but it is
diﬃcult to conﬁrm because its proximity to the head
complicates the interpretation of the morphology. The
magnetic ﬁeld vectors at the apex show a radial instead
of tangential orientation as seen in other parts of the
PWN boundary. Similar protrusions and chimney-like
structures are seen in the Crab Nebula (Bietenholz &
Kronberg 1990) and in Kes 75 (Ng et al. 2008). The
apex could be formed by the leakage of PWN materials
into the surrounding shocked SN ejecta, similar to the
chimney of the Crab Nebula. However, one diﬀerence
between the Crab Nebula and the body of the Snail is
that the boundary magnetic ﬁeld of the Crab Nebula is
primarily radial (Bietenholz & Kronberg 1990), and so
the physical processes appear to be diﬀerent.

The nature of the faint emission outside of the bay,
which is outlined by the outermost contour in Figure 3,
could be important for understanding the evolution sce-
nario of G327.1−1.1. It has been suggested as part of the
PWN (Sun et al. 1999), implying that the true bound-
ary of the PWN should lie outside the bay, such that the
head would be pointing closer to the center of the body

as suggested by simulations (Temim et al. 2015), instead
of being tangential to its edge.

4.1.5. Eastern and Western Point Sources

As pointed out in Section 3.1, our radio maps revealed
two point sources in the northern edge of the PWN. We
found that the eastern one is unpolarized (Figure 5) and
has an inverted spectrum of α ∼ +0.9, which diﬀers sig-
niﬁcantly from the typical value of −0.3 (cid:46) α (cid:46) 0 for
PWNe. These points suggest that it is likely an unre-
lated background source.
On the other hand, the western source has a spectral
index of α ∼ −0.7 and is about 10% polarized at 6 and
3 cm. The polarized emission allows us to determine the
RM of the source and its value is consistent with that of
the surrounding PWN (see Figure 6), suggesting a similar
distance. It also spatially coincides with the ﬁlaments in
the PWN. Therefore, we argue that it is associated with
the Snail, possibly an unresolved compact knot as part
of the ﬁlaments.

4.2. Simple Modeling of Turbulence in the Snail

As mentioned earlier, the highly ordered magnetic ﬁeld
found in the Snail could imply a large characteristic scale
of the turbulence. To get a handle on the scale in this
case, we consider a toy model of the body of the Snail
(i.e. excluding the head) as a non-evolving spherical neb-
ula. This assumption is based on the fact that we do
not expect signiﬁcant multipolar anisotropy in the pres-
sure exerted by the reverse shock, except for the dipolar
component, which will displace the PWN instead of de-
forming it. The volume of the nebula is divided into
patches of uniform size that represent the characteristic
turbulence scale in the PWN. The turbulent magnetic
ﬁeld is implemented in our model by assigning a mag-
netic ﬁeld with random orientation but uniform strength
to each of the patches. We argue that this assumption is
justiﬁed, as the magnetic ﬁeld inferred from simulations
(Temim et al. 2015) is close to the equipartition value
we derived in Section 4.4 below, and therefore the ﬂuc-
tuations in the magnetic ﬁeld strength should be small.
Otherwise, the ﬂuctuation will rapidly fade away over a
timescale of the order of the sound crossing time (which
is much shorter than the age of the system). The elec-
tron density is also assumed to be uniform for the same
reason, and we assume a power-law distribution with the
index given by the measured radio spectrum. We further
allow for the possibility that a patch is ﬁlled with cold
SNR material instead of non-thermal pulsar wind parti-
cles. This mixing of SN ejecta in the Snail was suggested
based on X-ray observations (Temim et al. 2015) and can
also be seen in other reverse shock crushed PWNe such
as Vela X (LaMassa et al. 2008). The probability that a
patch is ﬁlled by synchrotron-emitting pulsar wind par-
ticles is simply the ﬁlling factor in our model. If there is
no signiﬁcant mixing of materials in the PWN, then the
modeling results with a ﬁlling factor of 100% should ﬁt
the observations best, while a lower ﬁlling factor would
suggest substantial mixing.

We integrated the synchrotron emission along diﬀer-
ent lines of sight through the volume of the nebula in
all of the Stokes parameters to compute the radio maps
for comparisons with our observations. For this, we con-
volved the simulation results with the radio beam. Note

the vectors show the nebular B-ﬁeld directions and the lengths represent the polarized intensity. Each model is comprised of patches of a
certain size as indicated at the bottom, with the magnetic ﬁeld orientation randomly chosen for each of the patches. The pulsar wind ﬁlling
factor is also indicated to the left. The observations of the Snail at 6 cm are shown in the upper right panel with the same color scale.

that the randomness introduced by the ﬁlling factor and
the magnetic ﬁeld orientations make it possible to ex-
actly reproduce the observations if we run the model
for a considerable number of times (albeit that will be
meaningless), and therefore it is more sensible to only
produce one set of maps per combination of parameters,
and then inspect by eye the scales of the structures, the
number of features in the PWN, and the contrast in ra-
dio intensity instead of looking for a perfect match. This
allows us to place a rough constraint on the ﬁlling fac-

tor and the characteristic turbulence scale of the Snail.
The simulated intensity and ﬂuctuation maps are shown
in Figures 8 and 9. A ﬁlling factor of 50–75% and a
patch size of 1/8–1/6 of the PWN radius (RPWN) ap-
pear to give the best match between the simulations and
the data, such that they have comparable numbers of
small-scale features and contrast in the intensity maps.
In Figure 10 we show the simulated polarization maps.
A large ﬁlling factor or small patch size generally give
a lower polarization fraction. This is because, as there

the upper right panel.

are more patches with diﬀerent B-ﬁeld orientation along
a line of sight, depolarization becomes more severe. We
ﬁnd that the same range of ﬁlling factor and patch size
as above provide the best ﬁt to the observation. If this
simple model is true, then the simulation results suggest
that mixing in this PWN is signiﬁcant and the turbulence
scale is about RPWN/8 – RPWN/6. The former conclu-
sion is in line with the speculation of Temim et al. (2015),
and should be taken into account for further theoretical
work with the Snail. Finally, we note that the randomly

oriented magnetic ﬁeld in this simple model does not sat-
isfy the solenoid condition (i.e., ∇ · B = 0). Therefore,
it fails to reproduce the magnetic loops in the PWN in-
terior and the tangential ﬁeld structure at the boundary
as observed. Instead, it is more useful to compare the
coherence scales of the models with the observations.

4.3. Radio Spectrum of the Snail

We determined a spectral index of α = −0.3 ± 0.1 for
the Snail between 36 and 6 cm. Such a ﬂat spectrum

respectively (see text for details). The polarization map of the Snail at 6 cm is shown in the upper right panel. We note that the large
polarization fraction near the edge of the PWN is mostly due to noise, as the radio emission is weak.

is typical for PWNe. The ﬂux density at 3 cm is not
well determined as the observations are only sensitive to
smaller structures in the PWN but not the whole neb-
ula. The head of the Snail has a steeper spectral index
of α = −0.6 ± 0.1. This is unexpected, as X-ray obser-
vations suggest that the particles are injected from the
head (e.g. Sun et al. 1999; Temim et al. 2009, 2015), and
therefore the materials in the head should be younger
than those of the body. This means that the spectral
diﬀerence probably cannot be explained by synchrotron

cooling. We also note that this spectral index is con-
siderably steeper than the generally expected value for
PWNe (−0.3 ≤ α ≤ 0), which is rather unusual and
requires further theoretical modeling to explain.

4.4. Minimum-energy Magnetic Field Strength in the

PWN

We computed the minimum-energy magnetic ﬁeld
strength by imposing the conventional assumption, i.e.
that the total energy Utotal is distributed between mag-

DataRPWN/4RPWN/6RPWN/8100%75%50%25%12

Ma et al.

netic energy UB and particle energy Up in a way that
Utotal is minimized. From synchrotron theory (Pachol-
czyk 1970), we have

Utotal = UB + Up =

ΦV + c12(1 + η)LsynB−3/2, (2)

B2
8π

where Φ is the volume ﬁlling factor of the magnetic ﬁeld,
V is the volume of the emission region, c12 is a con-
stant weakly depending on the spectral index and fre-
quency range considered, η is the energy ratio of ions to
electrons, and Lsyn is the synchrotron luminosity of the
PWN. Minimizing Utotal gives a minimum-energy ﬁeld,

Bm =(cid:2)6πc12(1 + η)LsynΦ−1V −1(cid:3)2/7

,

(3)

which is also referred to as the “equipartition ﬁeld” in
some literature. We integrated the simple power-law ra-
dio spectrum for the entire PWN (as in the ﬁt of Figure 4)
between 107 and 1013 Hz (e.g. Ng et al. 2010, 2012), and
found Lsyn = 2.9 × 1035d2
9 erg s−1, where d9 is the dis-
tance to the Snail in units of 9 kpc. To estimate the
volume V , we modeled the body as a sphere of diame-
ter 4(cid:48) and the head as a cylinder with a diameter of 0.(cid:48)4
and a length of 1.(cid:48)5. The volume of the PWN is then
V = 1.8 × 1058d3
9 cm3. Substituting these parameters
into Equation 3 gives

Bm = 36(1 + η)2/7Φ−2/7d

−2/7
9

µG.

(4)

Assuming η = 0, Φ = 1, and d9 = 1, we ﬁnd a minimum-
energy ﬁeld of 36 µG in the Snail, which is of the same
order of magnitude as that estimated by modeling the
broadband emission of the PWN (11 µG; Temim et al.
2015). Note that the computed minimum-energy ﬁeld
strength can depend on the frequency range chosen. For
instance, if we only integrate up to 1011 Hz instead of
1013 Hz, then we obtain a slightly lower value of 26 µG,
and it is much less sensitive to the lower frequency limit.
It is also worth noting that the energy in the pulsar wind
is believed to be particle-dominated upon injection, and
hence the minimum-energy condition is not guaranteed
to hold.

We also computed the minimum-energy ﬁeld strength
of the body and the head separately, using identical pro-
cedures as above. For the body, we have Lsyn,body =
2.1×1035 erg s−1 and Vbody = 1.8×1058 cm3, which gives
Bm,body = 34 µG. For the head, we have Lsyn,head =
4.1 × 1033 erg s−1 and Vhead = 9.9 × 1055 cm3, which
gives Bm,head = 69 µG. The higher minimum-energy
ﬁeld strength in the head as compared to that in the body
could suggest that the reverse shock has compressed the
former but not yet the latter.

4.5. Multiwavelength Comparison

Figure 1b shows that the radio peak of the head is oﬀset
from the X-ray point source by ∼ 18(cid:48)(cid:48) (corresponding to
0.8 pc at a distance of 9 kpc), which is larger than the
astrometric uncertainty of ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48) of Chandra and the radio
beam size (FWHM ∼ 15(cid:48)(cid:48)). A similar oﬀset is found
in other systems, including G319.9−0.7 (Ng et al. 2010)
and the Lighthouse Nebula (Pavan et al. 2014) powered
by PSR J1101−6101 (Halpern et al. 2014), in which the
radio and X-ray peaks are displaced by 4 pc and 0.7 pc,
respectively. On the other hand, there is no detectable

radio emission at the location of the X-ray prongs and
arc of the Snail. This is analogous to the X-ray jet-
like structures seen in the Guitar Nebula (Hui & Becker
2007) and the Lighthouse Nebula (Pavan et al. 2014).
This could be the result of the diﬀusion of high-energy
particles, but the density is too low for the radio emission
to be detected. We also note that the prong structures
are aligned with the edge of the radio head.

The broadband synchrotron spectra of PWNe often
steepen at high frequency due to synchrotron cooling.
For a single population of particles injected into the sys-
tem, the spectral break frequency νb and magnetic ﬁeld
strength B could be used to estimate the PWN age τ by

τ =

1021 Hz

Using the νb = 1013 Hz obtained through extrapolation
of radio and X-ray spectra (Figure 4b) and the minimum-
energy ﬁeld strength obtained above (Bm = 36 µG) gives
τ = 46 kyr for the Snail. If we instead use the magnetic
ﬁeld strength estimate from modeling (11 µG; Temim
et al. 2015), then we acquire an even larger τ = 270 kyr.
These values diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the age estimates
of 11–29 kyr from previous studies (Sun et al. 1999;
Bocchino & Bandiera 2003; Temim et al. 2009, 2015). We
argue that the simple estimate from the spectral break
may not reﬂect the true age of the system. The change in
spectral index by a simple extrapolation of the radio and
X-ray spectra is ∆α ≈ 0.9. This suggests that the actual
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the system can be
much more complicated than expected, as the result of a
broken power-law injection spectrum and enhanced syn-
chrotron burnoﬀ induced by the reverse shock interaction
(see Temim et al. 2015). This can be veriﬁed by future
observations between the radio and X-ray bands.

Figure 4b shows the broadband SED of the Snail from
radio to γ-rays, with the γ-ray data from Fermi and
H.E.S.S. (Acero et al. 2012, 2013). While the TeV γ-ray
spectrum from H.E.S.S. appears to align with the X-ray
spectrum, this is probably just coincidence (see Temim
et al. 2015).

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented radio observations of
the Snail PWN in SNR G327.1−1.1 using ATCA and
compared the results with the previous MOST study
(Whiteoak & Green 1996). The PWN shows the same
morphology in all the ﬁve bands between 36 and 3 cm,
consisting of a main circular body believed to be the
“relic” PWN and a protruding head. The 6 and 3 cm
polarization maps reveal a highly ordered magnetic ﬁeld
structure, in contrast with the turbulent interior with a
tangled magnetic ﬁeld structure expected for a reverse
shock crushed PWN. This may suggest that the char-
acteristic turbulence scale is larger than the radio beam
size. To explore this scenario, we developed a toy model
to simulate the emission from a turbulent PWN and
found that a characteristic turbulence scale of ∼ RPWN/8
– RPWN/6 with a ﬁlling factor of 50–75% can most closely
match the observations.

We showed that the magnetic ﬁeld at the head of the
Snail aligns with the nebular elongation. This serves as a

good example of subsonic cometary PWN systems with
magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the tail. In addition, we discov-
ered ﬁlamentary structures in the body which could be
magnetic loops. It is, however, unclear whether they are
formed by kink instabilities as suggested for 3C 58 and
G54.1+0.3, or by turbulence during the reverse shock
interaction. We also determined a spectral
index of
α = −0.3 ± 0.1 for the overall PWN in the observed
radio bands, which gives a minimum-energy magnetic
ﬁeld strength of Bm ≈ 36 µG. The radio spectrum of the
head appears to be steeper than that of the body, which
