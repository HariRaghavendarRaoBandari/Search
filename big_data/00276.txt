In this work we consider magnetic reconnection in thin current sheets with both resistive and electron inertia
eﬀects. When the current sheet is produced by a primary instability of the internal kink type, the analysis of
secondary instabilities indicates that reconnection proceeds on a time scale much shorter than the primary
instability characteristic time. In the case of a sawtooth crash, non-collisional physics becomes important
above a value of the Lundquist number which scales like S ∼ (R/de)12/5, in terms of the tokamak major radius
R and of the electron skin depth de. This value is commonly achieved in present day devices. As collisionality
is further reduced, the characteristic rate increases, approaching Alfv´enic values when the primary instability
approaches the collisionless regime.

INTRODUCTION

Current sheets are a common occurrence in labora-
tory and space plasmas. They appear as a local two-
dimensional current concentration and they can be ei-
ther the natural product of convective, often turbulent,
plasma motion or the result of a plasma instability en-
tering its non-linear stage.

In this work, we study the instability of generic current
sheets, addressing the question of whether reconnection
can be fast enough to account for the observed rates of
common events such as the sawtooth crash in a tokamak
and possibly solar ﬂares.

We consider a plasma characterised by a non-uniform
average magnetic ﬁeld B0, varying on a characteristic
scale length L0. The structure of a current sheet is an
almost planar current concentration of extension L ∼ L0
in two spatial dimensions and thickness a ≪ L. By def-
inition, the current density in the sheet would diﬀer ap-
preciably from the ambient current density. However one
can argue, and it will be shown below, that such current
concentration is unstable to fast growing perturbations.
Therefore the current density in the sheet Jcs cannot ex-
ceed too much the ambient current density J0, and there-
fore one can reasonably assume Jcs ∼ J0 ∼ B0/L0.

Moreover, a current sheet would generally evolve in
time. However, when studying its stability, it is conve-
nient to assume it to be in a quasi-stationary state, if
one is interested in instability growth rates much faster
than the underlying evolution rate. As a consequence, a
current sheet can be modelled as a planar system in local
force balance. In the following, we further assume that
the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is almost constant and that
the current density in the sheet is almost aligned to it.

The current in the sheet produces a magnetic ﬁeld
Bcs ∼ Jcsa, which lays in the plane and it is transverse
to the main magnetic ﬁeld. From the previous estimate
of Jcs one concludes

Bcs ∼ B0

a
L0

.

(1)

This scaling is certainly pertinent when the current
sheet is the result of a large ∆′ primary instability as in
the case of the sawtooth phenomenon, which is discussed
in detail in Sec. III. In this instance, scaling (1) marks the
transition to the nonlinear phase if a is the linear layer
width. Therefore we are assuming that the current sheet
becomes unstable to secondary instabilities at an early
stage of the nonlinear evolution of the primary instability,
a result we will ﬁnd consistent with the estimates derived
later in this work.

Note also that, by assuming this scaling of Bcs with the
current sheet thickness, we depart fundamentally from
previous works1–10, where the scaling Bcs ∼ B0 is im-
plicitly assumed. The implications of this diﬀerent as-
sumption are discussed more in detail in Sec. IV. Here
we anticipate that Pucci and Velli 1 pointed out that by
increasing the current sheet aspect ratio, tearing mode
theory predicts an increasing growth rate, reaching “ideal
tearing”, or the the Alfv´enic limit, at a characteristic as-
pect ratio that depends on the regime considered1–5. The
dependence of the growth rate on the aspect ratio is ex-
ploited in an essential way also in the present work, as
discussed later.

Moreover, the presence of a strong guide ﬁeld B0 allows
one to treat the problem in the framework of reduced
MHD. In this respect, we depart from the work of Ref. 11,
where the guide ﬁeld is assumed zero.

In the following, we consider the resistive case, de-

scribed by the model

written in terms of the normalised stream function
ˆφ ≡ cφ/B0, where φ is the electrostatic potential, and
of the normalized magnetic ﬂux function ˆψ ≡ ψ/B0.

ˆu = b0 × ∇ ˆφ and the magnetic ﬁeld is ˆB = b0 − b0 × ∇ ˆψ,
with b0 the unit vector of the local ambient magnetic
ﬁeld B0. Moreover we have introduced the Alfv´en ve-
locity c2
0 /(4πmin0) and the magnetic diﬀusivity
ˆη ≡ c2η/(4π). The symbol || refers to the parallel com-
ponent with respect to the total magnetic ﬁeld and ⊥
refers to the components perpendicular to the local am-
bient ﬁeld. Their exact expression depends on the con-
text and they will be later speciﬁed in the case of slab
and cylindrical geometry. Note that in Eqs.(2-3) lengths
and times still appear in dimensional units.

A ≡ B2

In the following we ﬁrst derive the scaling of fast re-
connection in a general large aspect ratio slab (Sec.II).
Then, we apply the result to the sawtooth problem, by
evaluating whether the sawtooth crash can result from
the instability of the current sheet generated by a pri-
mary m = 1 mode in a cylindrical tokamak (Sec.III). In
particular, we compare our conclusions with the existing
numerical results (Sec.III B), and we analyse the transi-
tion to the non-collisional regime. We ﬁnally point out
the diﬀerence with other works on fast reconnection, and
we outline possible future work (Sec.IV).

II. SCALING OF THE MAXIMUM RECONNECTION
RATE

Labelling with “eq” the equilibrium quantities and
leaving the perturbations unlabelled, we start by lineariz-
ing Eqs.(2-3) around an equilibrium with ˆφeq = 0 (no
ﬂow),

where ∇k = ˆB · ∇.

Adopting a local Cartesian coordinate system, we in-
dicate with x the coordinate perpendicular to the sheet,
y the direction of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld Bcs and
z the direction of the ambient ﬁeld B0. Moreover, for
the sake of simplicity one can assume a symmetric cur-
rent distribution, such that Bcs = 0 at x = 0 and two
dimensional perturbations such that ∂z = 0.

In the neighbourhood of x = 0 the parallel gradient

operator takes the form

∇||eq ∼ (B′

cs(0)/B0) kx ∼ (kx/L0).

(6)

We can now derive the scaling of the growth rate γ
and of the inner reconnecting layer width δ in both the
tearing (labelled as “T ”) and internal kink (labelled as
“K”) regimes. We recall that these regimes are identiﬁed
by the conditions ∆′δ < 1 and ∆′δ > 1, respectively,
where ∆′ is the usual tearing mode stability parameter12.
The scaling can be obtained, up to numerical constants,
without carrying out the detailed asymptotic matching
calculations, by taking x ∼ δ, so that ∇||eq ∼ (kδ/L0).
Moreover using the fact that k ≪ δ−1, ∂x ∼ δ−1 and the
estimate ˆφ′′ ∼ ˆφ/δ2, we obtain the following heuristic
balance relations, respectively from Eq.(4) (l.h.s. and
ﬁrst r.h.s. term) and from Eq.(5),

the internal-kink (large-∆′ regime) and as ∂2

ˆψ ∼ ˆψ/δ2

Introducing the macroscopic Alfv´en time τ0 ≡ L0/cA
and the Lundquist number referred to the macroscopic
scales S0 ≡ L0cA/ˆη, the following scaling is obtained:

Note that these scalings do not depend explicitly on the
current sheet thickness a. However, in the tearing regime
they do depend implicitly on a via ∆′, which also brings
in an additional dependence on the wavenumber. If the
aspect ratio L/a is suﬃciently large so that many wave-
numbers are excited, a fastest growing mode exists13–15
at the wavenumber kM (S0) corresponding to the transi-
tion between the tearing and the internal kink regime.
This transition occurs when ∆′δ ≃ 1.

In order to see this, one has to specify the dependence
of ∆′ on a and k. Here we adopt the expression obtained
for the Harris16 pinch for small ka, that is, well above
the tearing instability threshold.

∆′ ∼

(12)

Note that the dependence ∼ 1/k of ∆′ for small k is
fairly common and that, in any case, what follows can be
easily generalised to a diﬀerent5 power-law dependence.

As indicated in the introduction, the above results are
of practical interest only if the underlying dynamics oc-
curs at a rate lower than the estimate (14).

When the current sheet is the result of a large-∆′ pri-
mary instability of a quiescent plasma, the time scale
of its dynamics can be obtained from (10) by taking
k ∼ L−1
. The corresponding
layer width is an estimate of the current sheet width,
. Using this information one can esti-
a ∼ δI ∼ L0S

bility from (14):

which is clearly higher than the primary instability
growth rate. One concludes that the current sheet of
such primary instability will become quickly unstable, as
soon as the primary current sheet becomes suﬃciently
thin. An application of this mechanism to the sawtooth
crash will be given in the next section.

More generally, current sheets occur as magnetic ﬂux
tubes are stretched and twisted by plasma advection. In
an ideal plasma, this mechanism produces thinner and
thinner current sheets. In a turbulent plasma with com-
parable kinetic and magnetic energy, the characteristic
time is the Alfv´en time τ0. Therefore a current sheet will
break up when its instability rate exceeds τ −1
0 . From (14)
one then deduces that the current sheet thickness must
be of the order of:

III. SECONDARY FAST RECONNECTION AT THE
TOKAMAK n = m = 1 RESONANT SURFACE

We now apply the above results to the m = n = 1 inter-
nal kink (IK) instability in a large aspect ratio tokamak.
The IK instability is considered an element of the saw-
tooth cycle17, an almost periodic oscillation of plasma
temperature characterised by a slow growth and a fast
collapse. In the framework of resistive MHD, the IK in-
stability is generally considered too slow to account for
the observed fast sawtooth collapse, especially in weakly
collisional plasmas18, so that non collisional eﬀects are
called in to explain observations19–21.

Here we take a diﬀerent approach. We consider a suf-
ﬁciently resistive plasma, so that the IK can be treated
with Eqs. (4-5), and we explore whether a secondary in-
stability, possibly in the collisionless regime, can be fast
enough to explain observations.

A. Primary internal-kink resistive mode

For the sake of clarity, in this subsection we review the

key elements of the internal kink theory.

We consider a large aspect ratio tokamak in the pe-
riodic cylindrical approximation for which the poloidal
equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld B0
θ is much smaller than the
toroidal one, herewith identiﬁed by B0. We adopt a set
of cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) for the radial, poloidal
and axial direction, respectively, with periodicity in θ and
ϕ. We also recall the expression of the safety factor:

q(r) ≡

rB0
RB0

θ (r)

,

(18)

where R is the major radius, the cylinder length be-
ing 2πR. Looking for perturbations of the form ˆψ, ˆJ ∼
cos(nϕ + mθ) , ˆφ ∼ sin(nϕ + mθ), with the replace-
ment ∂t → γ and using the corresponding cylindri-
cal expression for the parallel gradient operator ∇k =
∂ϕ + ˆϕ × ∇ ˆψ · ∇ we can write the outer equations of

Note that this scaling is the same as the commonly
quoted Sweet-Parker thickness. However the analogy ap-
pears only superﬁcial. This thickness has been obtained
here as the necessary condition for the break-up of a sheet
formed by Alfv´enic motion rather than as the result of
the nonlinear reconnection process.

(20)

One can see that, ﬁxing m = 1 and assuming a rational
surface exists in the plasma at a position r1 such that

q(r1) = −m/n = 1/n, the exact solution of this equation
(with vanishing boundary conditions) for any n and up to
an amplitude is ˆψ = r [(n + 1)/q(r)], ˆφ = −γrR, inside
the r = r1 surface, and ˆψ = 0, ˆφ = 0 outside the r = r1
surface. This implies that ∆′ = ∞ for these modes.

The case n = 1 is of interest for the sawtooth problem

in a tokamak.

In the neighborhood of the point r1 at which q = −1
for m = n = 1, contained in the inner reconnecting layer
of width δ, we can approximate

(21)

where Ls is the shear length in tokamak geometry, q1 = 1
by deﬁnition and ˆs1 = r1q′(r1)/q1 is the magnetic shear
at r = r1.

By carrying out the same balance as in the slab, large-

∆′ case, one obtains

(22)
where in this instance the Alfv´en time and the
Lundquist number are deﬁned using R as a normalisa-
tion length. The above results are identical to the slab
case by taking L0 = R/ ˆs1, k = r−1
and accounting for
1
the change of normalisation length.

B. Secondary instability and the sawtooth crash time scale

At the end of the linear phase, a current sheet develops
around the X-point, having the form of an helical ribbon
of helicity (1, 1) and radius r1. As a ﬁrst approximation,
we treat the problem as a planar sheet of width δI , given
by the inner layer width of the primary mode m = n = 1.
Since at the end of the linear phase the perturbed current
density is comparable to the equilibrium one21,24, the
magnitude of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld in the current
sheet, B I

cs,θ, can be estimated as

B I
cs,θ
B0

≃

,

for x ≤ δI .

(23)

As the IK instability enters the nonlinear phase, the
extension of the sheet, L, would grow from a few times
δI , to a a fraction of the circumference of radius r1 (e.g.,
Waelbroeck estimates22 it to be ∼ 2πr1/3), so we as-
sume δI < L < r1. As the extension grows, higher and
higher wave-numbers are progressively destabilised, with
the smallest unstable wave-vector given by kmin ≡ 2π/L.
We now adapt the results of the previous section to
the present context. In the following we call δII the layer
width of the secondary instability and γII the correspond-
ing growth rate. For the regime tearing of the secondary
mode we obtain

By integrating the reduced-MHD (RMHD) equations
in cylindrical geometry, Yu et al.23 have found that the
current layer generated by the nonlinear growth of a pri-
mary m/n = 1/1 magnetic island becomes strongly un-
stable to secondary tearing modes.

According to our calculation (29), in the secondary
island regime, a weak positive dependence of the recon-
R, is expected. This appears
nection time on SR, ∼ S
consistent with the dependence shown in Fig. 5 of Yu et
al.23 (black bullets).

In many middle-size tokamaks, the rate given by
Eq. (29) is probably fast enough to account for the ob-
served evolution of the sawtooth crash. To assess the
validity of the resistive model, one has to compare the
predicted rate with the electron collision rate νe. Us-
ing the fact that ˆη ∼ νed2
e, where de is the electron skin
depth, and ignoring geometrical factors, one can consider
two cases.

For the validity of Eq. (22) (primary instability) one

requires γI < νe, which can be recast as

τ0νe >

de
R

.

(30)

On the other hand, for the validity of Eq. (29) (sec-
ondary instability) one requires γII < νe, which gives the
more restrictive condition

τ0νe > (cid:18) de

(31)

In the intermediate regime

(32)

the primary instability can be treated with resistive
MHD, while a non-collisional model is required to treat
the secondary instability correctly.

Finally, when condition (30) is also violated, also the
growth rate of the primary instability depends on non-
collisional physics20,21,24.

The three collisionality regimes are summarized in

Fig. 1.

The eﬀect of non-collisional physics can be evaluated
by considering the model with electron inertia21 and
adapting the estimates of Sec. II. Then, by using again
∆′ ∼ 1/ka2, and R ∼ L0, Eqs. (8-11) are replaced by

(36)

The growth rate and the layer width as a function of
the wavenumber are sketched in log-log plot in Fig. 2 for
the collisional (Eqs. (8-11) with ∆′ given by (12)) and
non-collisional regime (Eqs. (33-36)).

In the intermediate regime the situation with the two
(collisional and non-collisional) estimates is summarized
in Fig. 3.

One can see that, apart from a range at the largest
wave-numbers, the growth rate of the secondary insta-
bility is determined by non-collisional physics. In partic-
ular, the peak growth rate, occurring at the transition
between (33) and (35), scales like

γM τ0 ∼

d2
e
a2 .

(37)

As one approaches the right boundary of the intermediate
regime, the thickness of the primary layer decreases, we
recall, as ∼ L0S−1/3. Thus the maximum growth rate of
the secondary instability grows again as ∼ S2/3. This be-
haviour is also shown in Fig. 1. At the right boundary of
this regime, S → (L0/de)3 and a → de. Then the current
sheet produced by the primary instability approaches the
electron skin depth while the maximum growth rate of the
secondary instability approaches Alfv´enic values.

5

The growth rate (37) is fast enough to account for the
observed sawtooth crash time in a machine like JET18.
These observations call for a non-collisional theory since
the observed rates are faster than the collision frequency.
In this respect, referring again to Fig. 1, we notice that
our approach brings the boundary, beyond which the col-

12

of the Lundquist number is much more easily achieved in

lisionless eﬀects matter, down to S ∼ (cid:16) R
de(cid:17)
de(cid:17)3
large tokamaks than S ∼ (cid:16) R

at which the primary
instability enters the collisionless regime (upper bound-
ary of the intermediate regime). One can also remark
that the reconnection rate has a minimum that scales
like ∼ (de/L0)2/5, in Alfv´en units, in all collisionality
regimes.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The results of Yu et al.23 have also been interpreted25
in terms of the plasmoid instability 8. However, it appears
that the literature on the plasmoid instability does not
take into account the rescaling of the current sheet mag-
netic ﬁeld with respect to its macroscopic, reference value
(Eq.(1)). We recall that this is necessary to estimate cor-
rectly the size of the current sheet magnetic ﬁeld at the
end of the linear phase of a primary instability such as
the m = n = 1 mode in the sawtooth phenomenon.

By ignoring such rescaling, the secondary instability
is faster, such that the maximum growth rate given in
Eq. (14) would be replaced by1

γM τ0 ∼ S

− 1
2

a (cid:19)
0 (cid:18) L0

3
2

.

(38)

By assuming that the width of the current sheet re-
sulting from the primary instability scales like ∼ S−1/3
,
as in this work, together with estimate (38), one would
conclude that the maximum growth rate scales like the
ideal tearing growth rate γII τ0 ∼ O(1), independent of
resistivity.

R

These assumptions are at the root of the work of Pucci
and Velli as a criterion for ideal tearing reconnection rate
in a purely resistive model1,3,4.

If on the other hand one assumed a narrower current
layer scaling `a-la Sweet-Parker, a ∼ L0S−1/2, and at the
same time one ignored the rescaling (Eq.(1)), thereby
using again estimate (38), one would end up with a faster-
than Alfv´enic estimate of the maximum growth rate ∼
S1/4. This seems the assumption adopted in the context
of the plasmoid instability theory5,8,10.

In the scenario where the current sheet is produced by
a primary instability, as in the sawtooth case, we consider
the results based on the ideal tearing and on the plas-
moid instability unlikely, since we have shown that the
current sheet becomes suﬃciently unstable to secondary
sub-Alfv´enic modes at an earlier stage in its development
and it would therefore likely break up before becoming

than the estimates of Eqs. (1) and (11), respectively.

In summary, in this work we have shown that a cur-
rent sheet generated by a primary instability, such as the
internal kink mode, becomes suﬃciently unstable at an
early stage in its nonlinear development.

When applied to the context of the sawtooth phe-
nomenon, the analysis of the secondary instability reveals
that the sawtooth crash due to reconnection proceeds at a
faster rate than previous estimates based on the primary
m = n = 1 internal kink mode21. In the case of a purely
resistive model, the reconnection rate depends weakly on
the Lundquist number, ∼ S−1/6, and it appears in agree-
ment with the results of numerical simulations at large
Lundquist number23. Also, the value of the Lundquist
number at which collisionless eﬀects become important is
found to be substantially lower than the estimate based

on the primary instability only. This broadens the range
of tokamaks to which collisionless eﬀects should be taken
into account in the analysis of the sawtooth phenomenon.
Finally, near-Alfv´enic reconnection rates can be achieved
by secondary instabilities when collisionless eﬀects be-
come important also for the primary instability.

The scope of this work is to outline a possible scenario
for fast reconnection, and in this respect, scaling esti-
mates are useful, and suﬃcient for a ﬁrst investigation.
Detailed stability analysis of current sheets, taking into
account the actual geometry, such as the m = 1 ribbon,
is a possibility to obtain more precise predictions about
the maximum growth rate, the associated wavenumber,
and the instability threshold. This might lead to an ex-
planation of the Lundquist number threshold observed in
numerical simulations23 and of the number of observed
secondary islands.

FIG. 3: The scalings of the resistive (label “res”) and of
the purely inertia-driven (label “de”) regimes at L = L0
and for (L/de)12/5 < S < (L/de)3 are respectively given

by (10) and (35) for the primary growth rates (γI τ0)

and by (8) and (33) for the growth rates of the

secondary tearing modes (γT τ0). Similarly, (11), (36)

and (9), (34) give the inner layer widths δI /L and δT /L

of the secondary reconnecting modes.

The eﬀect of ﬂows also merits an investigation. In this
respect, one notes that ﬂows are small near the primary
instability X-point, which is a stagnation point, but may
be signiﬁcant far from it, potentially leading to stabilis-
ing eﬀects on the tearing mode3,26 and/or to additional
instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz’s27–29.

Finally, the stability analysis carried out in in this
work is based on a magnetic conﬁguration with the
current aligned to a main magnetic ﬁeld. Relaxing this
hypothesis and allowing for pressure gradients would
open further possibilities.
