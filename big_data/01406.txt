Abstract

Contrary to the general belief, there has recently been quite a few examples of unitary
evolution of quantum cosmological models. The present work gives more examples, namely
Bianchi type VI and type II. These examples are important as they involve varying spatial
curvature unlike the most talked about homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models
like Bianchi I, V and IX. We exhibit either explicit example of the unitary solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation, or at least show that a self-adjoint extension is possible.

Introduction

A quantum description of the universe should emerge from a quantum theory of gravity which
still eludes the reach in a generally accepted form. Quantum cosmology is a moderately ambi-
tious programme where quantum mechanical principles are employed in a gravitational system
in the absence of a more general quantum theory of gravity. Of course quantum cosmology has
its own motivation, such as looking for a resolution of the problem of singularity at the birth of
the universe. The basic framework for quantum cosmology is provided by the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation[1, 2, 3]. Amongst the inﬁnitely many possible metric, only a particular form is normally
chosen by hand from the consideration of symmetry. This is the usual minisuperspace which
reduces the degrees of freedom to a ﬁnite number and thus makes the problem tractable. There
are quite a few reviews which discuss the development of the subject and some of its conceptual
problems[4, 5, 6].

One major problem is that the quantization of anisotropic models are believed to give rise to
a non-unitary evolution of the wave function resulting in a nonconservation of probability. It is

interesting to note that this non-unitarity is often apt to be invisible in the absence of a properly
oriented scalar time parameter in the scheme of quantization[7, 8]. In a relativistic theory, time
itself is a coordinate and fails to be the scalar parameter against which the evolution should
be studied. In fact the problem of the proper identiﬁcation of time in quantum cosmology is a
subject by itself and dealt with by many[9, 10, 11, 12].

A novel idea about the identiﬁcation of time through the evolution of a ﬂuid present in the
model appeared to work very well. The method, where the ﬂuid variables are endowed with
dynamical degrees of freedom through some thermodynamic potentials[13, 14], was suggested by
Lapchinskii and Rubakov[15]. It has been shown that the time parameter that emerges out of the
ﬂuid evolution has the required monotonicity as well as the correct orientation[16]. This Schutz
formalism is now very widely used in quantizing cosmological models[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

Until very recently, the non-conservation of probability in anisotropic models had almost
been generally accepted as a pathology, and had been ascribed to the hyperbolicity of the
Hamiltonian[19]. Not that the anisotropic models are of utmost importance so far as the ob-
served universe is concerned, but this feature of non-unitarity renders the quantization scheme
vulnerable. Also, the formation of structure in the universe indeed requires a small but ﬁnite
anisotropy of ∆ρ

ρ ∼ 10−5.

There has now been a new turn in this picture. Majumder and Banerjee[20] showed that a
suitable ordering of operators can lead to a alleviation of the problem, meaning that the prob-
ability is conserved except for a small period of time. Later it was clearly shown by Pal and
Banerjee[16, 22] that the said non-unitarity can actually be attributed to either an ordering of
operators or to a bad choice of variables. With a suitable ordering, examples of unitary evolution
were exhibited in Bianchi I, V and IX models. The degree of diﬃculty in integration allowed
only a few cases of choice of α which determines the equation of state (P = αρ) for which the
desired unitarity was established. However, even a few examples are good enough to indicate
that the problem is not actually pathological and can be cured. Very recently an example of a
unitary evolution for a Kanotowki-Sachs model has been given by Pal and Banerjee[23]. It was
also shown by Pal[24] that this unitarity is achieved not at the cost of anisotropy itself.

Except for the Kantowski-Sachs cosmology, all other examples of the anisotropic Bianchi mod-
els stated have one unifying feature, they are all of constant spatial curvature. The motivation
for the present work is to show that the possiblity of a self adjoint extension and hence a uni-
tary evolution is not a characteristic of models with a constant spatial curvature, this is in fact
more general and can be extended to models with variable spatial hypersurfaces as well. Two
speciﬁc examples, namely Bianchi II and VI are dealt with in the following sections. Section 2
deals with the formalism and takes up the example of the Bianchi VI model. Section 3 deals with
the Bianchi II model. The last section includes a summary and a discussion of the results obtained.

2 The formalism and Bianchi VI models

We start with the standard Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity along with a perfect ﬂuid given by

A = ZM

d4x√−gR + ZM

d4x√−gP,

3

(1)

where R is the Ricci Scalar, g is the determinant of the metric and P is the pressure of the
ideal ﬂuid. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the gravity sector and the second term is due to the
matter sector. Here we have ignored the contributions from boundary as it would not contribute
to the variation. The units are so chosen that 16πG = 1.

A Bianchi VI model is given by the metric

ds2 = n2(t)dt2 − a2(t)dx2 − e−mxb2(t)dy2 − exc2(t)dz2,

where the lapse function n and a, b, c are functions of time t and m is a constant.

From the metric given above, we can write the Ricci Scalar as

√−gR = e

(1−m)x

[ ˙a˙bc + ˙b ˙ca + ˙c ˙ab +

n2bc

(m2 − m + 1)](cid:21).

(2)

(3)

Using this, we can ﬁnd the action for the gravity sector from equation (1) which is given as

Ag = Z dt(cid:20) −

n

[ ˙a˙bc + ˙b ˙ca + ˙c ˙ab +

n2bc
4a

(m2 − m + 1)](cid:21),

where an overhead dot indicates a derivative with respect to time.

Now we make a set of transformation of variables as

a(t) = eβ0,
b(t) = eβ0+√3(β+−β−),
c(t) = eβ0−√3(β+−β−).

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

This introduces a constraint a2 = bc, but the model is still remains Bianchi Type VI without any
loss of the typical characteristics of the model. Such type of transformation of variables has been
extensively used in the literature[16, 20, 19]. One can now write the Lagrangian density of the
gravity sector as

Lg = −6

e3β0
n

[ ˙β2
0 − ( ˙β+ − ˙β−)2 +

e−2β0n2(m2 − m + 1)

12

].

(8)

Here β0 ,β+ and β− has been treated as coordinates. So corresponding Canonical momentum
. It is easy to check that one has p+ = −p−. Hence we can

will be p0, p+ and p− where pi = ∂Lg
write the corresponding Hamiltonian as

∂ ˙βi

Hg = −ne−3β0[

1
24

(p2
0 − p2

+ − 12(m2 − m + 1)e4β0)].

(9)

With the widely used technique, developed by Lapchinskii and Rubakov[15] by using the
Schutz formalism of writing the ﬂuid parameters in terms of thermodynamic variables[13, 14],
the action the ﬂuid sector can be written as

Af = Z dtLf = Z dt

(1 + α)1+ 1

α

α (cid:16) ˙ǫ + θ ˙S(cid:17)1+ 1

α e− S
 .

(10)

Here ǫ, θ, S are thermodynamic potentials. A constant volume factor V comes out of the
integral in both of (4) and (10). This V is inconsequential as it can be absorbed in the subsequent
variational principle. With a canonically transformed set of variables T, ǫ′ in place of S, ǫ, one
can ﬁnally write down the Hamiltonian for the ﬂuid sector as

4

The canonical transformation is given by the set of equations

Hf = ne−3β0e3(1−α)β0pT .

This method and the canonical nature of the transformation are comprehensively discussed

in reference [16].

The net or the super Hamiltonian is

H = Hg + Hf = −

24

[p2
0 − p2

+ − 12(m2 − m + 1)e4β0 − e3(1−α)β0 pT ].

(16)

Using the Hamiltonian constraint H = 0, which can be obtained by varying the action Ag + Af
with respect to the lapse function n, one can write the Wheeler-DeWitt equation as

[e3(α−1)β0 ∂2
∂β2

0 − e3(α−1)β0 ∂2

+ 12(m2 − m + 1)e(3α+1)β0]ψ = 24i

(17)

This equation is obtained after we promote the momenta to the corresponding operators given
by pi = −i ∂

in the units of ¯h = 1.

∂βi

It is interesting to note that for a particular value of m = m0 where m0 is a root of equation
m2−m+ 1 = 0, the spatial curvature vanishes and the equation (17) reduces to the corresponding
equation for a Bianchi Type I model[16]. We shall discuss the solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation in two diﬀerent cases, namely α = 1 and α 6= 1.

2.1 Stiﬀ ﬂuid: α = 1

For a stiﬀ ﬂuid (P = ρ), the equation (17) becomes simple and easily separable. It looks like

5

(20)

where N 2 = 3(m2 − m + 1). After making the change in variable as q = Ne2β0, above equation
can be written as

(21)

(22)

q2 ∂2φ

∂q2 + q

∂φ
∂q

+ [q2 − (6E − k2

Solution of this equation can be written in terms of Bessel’s functions as

φ(q) = Jν(q),

where ν = q6E − k2

+. Now for the construction of the wave packet, we need to ﬁx ν. If we

take ǫ = −ν2 = k2

+ − 6E then wave packet can have following expression

where

Ψ = Φ(q)ζ(β+)eiǫT /6.

ζ(β+) = Z dk+e−(k+−k+0)2

(23)

(24)

The norm indeed comes out to be positive and ﬁnite (for the detals of the calculations, we

refer to work of Pal and Banerjee [23]). Thus one indeed has a unitary time evolution.

2.2 General perfect ﬂuid: α 6= 1
Now we shall take the more complicated case of α 6= 1 and try to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation (17). We use a speciﬁc type of operator ordering with which equation (17) takes the
form

(cid:20)e

Ψ.

(25)

Now with the standard separation of variable as,

Ψ(β0, β+, T ) = φ(β0)eik+β+e−iET ,

the equation for φ becomes

+ e3(α−1)β0k2

For α 6= 1 we make a transformation of variable as

χ = e− 3

2 (α−1)β0,

and write equation (27) as

Above equation can be compared to −Hg = − d2
3(1−α) which
is a continuous and real valued function on the half line, and one can show that the Hamiltonian
Hg admits self-adjoint extension as Hg has equal deﬁciency indices. For a systematic and detail
description of the self-adjoint extension we can refer to the text by Reed and Simons[26].
So it can be said that for perfect ﬂuid with α 6= 1 Bianchi VI quantum models do admit a uni-
tarity evolution.

are real numbers and in both cases the energy spectra is given as

E′ = M 2 − λ2.

(37)

Self-adjoint extension guarantees that |B/A| takes a value so as to conserve probability and
make the model unitarity. The details of the calculations are omitted, as the analysis is similar
to that described in reference [22].

3 Bianchi II models:

Bianchi Type II model is given the line element

ds2 = dt2 − a2(t)dr2 − b2(t)dθ2 − [a2(t)θ2 + b2(t)]dφ2 + 2a2(t)θdrdφ,

(38)

and the process is a bit more involved for the presence of the non-diagonal terms in the metric.

The Ricci scalar R in this case is given by

R = −

If we deﬁne a new variable β = ab as prescribed in [19], then Lagrangian density for gravity

sector looks like

(40)

(41)

Using Schutz’s formalism and proper identiﬁcation of time as we did before, the Hamiltonian
density for ﬂuid sector can be written as

Hf = aαβ−2αpT .

The super Hamiltonian can now be written in following form

H = Hg + Hf =

As an example we take up the case of a stiﬀ ﬂuid given by α = 1.

After promoting the momenta by operators as usual, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation HΨ = 0

takes following form

16 − 2(k − E)].

Equations for both ψ and φ can be mapped to a Schrodinger equation for a particle in an
inverse square potential. In order to get a solution we actually have ensure an attractive regime,
which requires k ≤ 0 , E ≤ k − 3/32. We see that both the equations are that for inverse square
potentials, and thus a self-adjoint extension is possible. This case is actually very similar to the
Bianchi IX model as discussed in refefernce [22]. So we do not discuss this in detail.

4 Discussion and conclusion

The present work deals with two examples of anisotropic quantum cosmological models with
varying spatial curvature, namely Bianchi VI and II. We show that there is indeed a possibility
of ﬁnding unitary evolution of the system. The earlier work on anisotropic models with constant
spatial curvature[16, 22] disproved the belief that anisotropic quantum cosmologies generically
suﬀer from a pathology of non-unitarity. The present work now strongly drives home the fact
that this feature is not at all a charactristic of models with constant spatial curvature. It was
also shown before that the unitarity is not achieved at the cost of anisotropy itself[24]. One can
now indeed work with quantum cosmologies far more conﬁdently, as there is actually no built-in
generic non-conservation of probability in the models.

Very recently it has been shown that in fact all homogeneous models, isotropic or anisotropic,
quite generally have a self-adjoint extension[30]. The present work gives two more examples,
and consolidates the result proved in reference [30]. The extension, however, is non-unique in
anisotropic models.

Thus the standard canincal quantization of cosmological models via Wheeler-DeWitt equation
still proves to be useful in the absence of a more general quantum theory of gravity. The more
challenging work will now be the quantization of inhomogeneous cosmological models.
