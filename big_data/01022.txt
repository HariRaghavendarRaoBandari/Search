Abstract

A Markovian battery model is proposed to provide the variation of energy states for energy

harvesting (EH) secondary users (SUs) in the EH cognitive radio network (CRN). Based on the proposed

battery model, we derive the packet loss probability in the EH SUs due to sensing inaccuracy and energy

outage. With the proposed analysis, the packet loss probability can easily be predicted and utilized to

optimize the transmission policy (i.e., opportunities for successful transmission and EH) of EH SUs to

improve their throughput. Especially, the proposed method can be applied to upper layer (scheduling and

routing) optimization. To this end, we validate the proposed analysis through Monte-Carlo simulation

and show an agreement between the analysis and simulation results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Energy harvesting (EH) allows devices to charge energy from ambient power sources, such

as vibration, heat and electromagnetic waves. With the prevalence of wireless signals, radio fre-

quency (RF) EH has received substantial attention and has dramatically grown. A comprehensive

literature review on the research progress in wireless networks with RF EH is presented in [1].

RF EH becomes a candidate solution for self-sustainable energy supply, and the applications of

RF EH are investigated in various systems, such as wireless charging systems [2] and wireless

sensor networks [3]. It is particularly important for system such as body area networks (BANs),

because the battery of such devices is implanted in human body and battery replacement is

infeasible.

Besides energy efﬁciency, spectrum efﬁciency is one of the critical issues when designing a

wireless network. To improve spectrum utilization efﬁciency, dynamic spectrum access (DSA)

that allows the reuse of a radio spectrum in an opportunistic manner, has been proposed. The

cognitive radio (CR) is the enabling technology to support DSA. In CR networks (CRNs), primary

users (PUs) have higher priority in using radio spectrum. However, secondary users (SUs) are

allowed to access the spectrum as long as the spectrum is not temporally used by the PUs, and

share the spectrum as long as the PUs are properly protected [4]. Consequently, the EH CRN

becomes a promising approach to support both spectrum efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency [5].

A considerable number of works focused on the EH CRNs from different perspectives. The

opportunistic channel access policy is proposed to maximize the throughput of the EH SUs, when

the SU accesses the spectrum to transmit data or to harvests energy if the spectrum is idle or

occupied by the PU, respectively [6]. The optimization is formulated based on a Markov decision

policy (MDP) and an online learning algorithm is applied to adapt the channel access policy

without any prior knowledge. The energy causality constraint states that the total consumed

energy should be equal to or less than the total harvested energy, and an optimal sensing policy

is proposed to maximize the throughput of the EH SUs subject to an energy causality constraint

and a collision constraint mandating that the PU is required to be properly protected [7]. In

addition, to maximize the average throughput of the EH SUs, authors in [8] studied the optimal

pair of the sensing duration and the sensing threshold under an energy causality constraint and a

collision constraint. Since optimal sensing duration and sensing threshold are jointly intertwined

with the sensing performance and energy causality constraint, it is difﬁcult to directly acquire

[TECHNICAL REPORT]

optimal sensing duration and sensing threshold. Therefore, the authors ﬁrst obtained an optimal

sensing duration by analyzing the effect of sensing duration for a given sensing threshold, and

found an appropriate sensing threshold that meets the requirements of the previously derived

optimal sensing duration. In [9], the impact of temporal correlation of the primary trafﬁc on the

achievable throughput of the EH SU is investigated. The temporal correlation of the primary

trafﬁc is modeled according to a time-homogeneous Markov process to derive the upper bounds

on the achievable throughput as a function of the energy arrival rate and the temporal correlation

of the primary trafﬁc. Then the optimal sensing threshold is derived to maximize the theoretical

upper bound on the achievable throughput under the energy causality and collision constraints.

In [10], multiple SUs cooperate to sense a set of common channels, so as to maximize the

overall EH CRN throughput. To address the cooperative optimization problem, an online learning

algorithm is envolved to observe the primary channels and to make optimal decision when the

SUs cooperate in a round-robin fashion. Moreover, the cooperative decentralized optimization is

formulated as a decentralized partially observable MDP when the SUs cooperate in decentralized

manner. According to [11], the advanced smart antenna technologies including multiple-input

multiple-output and relaying techniques can be applied to signiﬁcantly improve the energy

efﬁciency and spectrum efﬁciency compared to single-antenna systems, and the corresponding

receiver architecture is discussed.

However, a theoretical model that provide the variation of energy states in the EH SU was

not developed. In this paper, we present a Markovian battery model for the EH SU equips with

an RF transceiver and an RF energy harvester separately. From the proposed model, we derive

the probability that the EH SU completely runs out of energy ﬁrst. In the EH CRN, the EH SUs

are allowed to transmit packets on a spectrum when the spectrum is idle and therefore may fail

to transmit data in the absence of an idle spectrum or/and sufﬁcient energy. Then, the packet

loss probability in the EH SU due to sensing inaccuracy and energy outage is analyzed.

II. NETWOK MODEL

An EH CRN with a single EH SU and numbers of PUs is considered, and a discrete time
model with time slotted in intervals of length T ∈ R+ is assumed, where R+ denotes the set of
nonnegative real numbers. In our work, the idle and the occupied spectrum states are denoted as
H0 and H1, respectively. The spectrum state is changed with the generation of primary signals
and modeled as a correlated, two-state process, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Therefore, the spectrum

[TECHNICAL REPORT]

switches its states between idle and occupied randomly. If the spectrum is occupied by the PU

in the current slot, the spectrum will be occupied by the PU with probability qo or the spectrum
state will transit to idle with probability 1− qo in the next time slot. Similarly, if the spectrum is
idle in the current slot, then the spectrum will remain idle with probability qi or will be occupied
by the PU with probability 1−qi in the next slot. Then we can derive the steady state probability
that the spectrum is idle or occupied as follows.

Consequently, the steady state probability of idle spectrum is derived as

πi(qi, qo) = Pr(H0) =

2 − qi − qo

,

(1)

(2)

and the steady state probability that the spectrum is occupied by the PU is πo(qi, qo) = Pr(H1) =
1 − πi(qi, qo).

Suppose that the EH SU has an RF transceiver and an RF energy harvester (i.e., EH board) with

separated antennas. Therefore, simultaneous data communication and EH are allowed in the EH

SU. In other words, both in-band RF EH and out-of-band RF EH are supported with the general

architecture introduced in [1]. While the EH SU can harvest energy from the same spectrum

as that of data communication in the in-band RF EH, the process of EH board is assumed to

be actively controllable so as not to share the same spectrum and reduce the efﬁciency of each

process. Consequently, in this paper we assume out-of-band RF EH only to avoid the conﬂict

between RF EH and data transmission, so that the EH SU with separated antenna harvests energy

in the frequency spectrum different from that used for data communication. When the EH board

[TECHNICAL REPORT]

5

is activated, the energy arrival is also modeled as a correlated, two-state process. Therefore, the

EH board harvests energy at a constant rate eh per time slot as long as RF signals are detected;
otherwise energy is not harvested. If the EH board harvests energy in the current slot, energy will

be harvested in the next time slot with probability pon or will not be harvested in the next slot
with probability 1 − pon. However, if no energy is harvested in the current slot, no energy will
be harvested with probability pof f or energy will be harvested with probability 1 − pof f in the
next slot. Similarly, the steady state probabilities of energy harvested and no energy harvested
are eon(pon, pof f ) = 1−pof f

and eof f (pon, pof f ) = 1−pon

, respectively.

We denote θm ∈ {0(T (ym) < ε), 1(T (ym) > ε)} as the spectrum sensing result at slot m.
If the energy of detected signal at slot m is larger than detection threshold ε, the spectrum is
regarded as occupied by the PU and the sensing result θm is equal to 1; otherwise, the spectrum
is idle and θm = 0. There are two important parameters associated with spectrum sensing: the
false alarm probability and the detection probability.

Under the hypothesis H0, we denote p0(x) as the probability density function (PDF) of T (y).

Based on the sensing result θm, the EH SU can opportunistically access the spectrum. With a
high false alarm probability, the idle spectrum is often recognized to be occupied by the PUs. As

a result, the improvement of spectrum efﬁciency is limited, because the EH SU is restricted to use

the idle spectrum. However, the EH SU frequently tends to access the occupied spectrum with a

low detection probability Pd. For highly accurate sensing, the detection probability should be as

[TECHNICAL REPORT]

7

high as possible, while the false alarm probability should be as low as possible. As mentioned

above, the spectrum is considered to be idle at time slot m, when the sensing result is θm = 0.
The spectrum access probability for an EH SU thus can be deﬁned as

δ , Pr(θm = 0)

(9)

Since there are only two measurable spectrum states, such as idle (H0) and occupied (H1), the
access probability can be derived according to the law of total probability as follows.

Pr(θm = 0|cm)Pr(cm)

δ = Xcm∈{H0,H1}
= [1 − Pf (ε)]πi(qi, qo) + [1 − Pd(ε)]πo(qi, qo).

(10)

We assume that the EH SU always has data to transmit. Therefore, the analysis can be applied

in the BANs where the biometric information is required to be transmitted in real time.

III. ANALYSIS OF PACKET LOSS PROBABILITY

We develop a Markovian battery model to capture the energy states of an EH SU equips with

an independent EH board and a capacity-limited battery. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the battery is

divided into L energy levels with unit of energy eu. We focus on how the energy state changes
from one to another depending on the spectrum access and EH. In our work, we assume short
sensing duration so that τs ≪ T . Compared with data transmission, spectrum sensing entails
negligible amount of energy. Therefore, energy consumed for spectrum sensing is not considered

and the unit of energy eu denotes sufﬁcient energy for data transmission. In addition, χ is assumed
to be 1 when energy arrival rate is eh = χeu. Suppose that the EH SU always has data to transmit,
we analyze transition probabilities at the energy state l (0 ≤ l < L) ﬁrst. Then the energy outage
propability that energy is completely ran out (l = 0) is drawn from the proposed model. Based

on sensing inaccuracy and energy outage, we deﬁne the packet loss probability.

1) l = 0: If the EH SU runs out of energy, i.e., if the energy state is l = 0, data transmission
is restricted. The energy state will be increased to l = 1 with probability p0,1 = eon as long
as the EH board detects the RF signal; otherwise, the energy state will be stuck in l = 0 with
probability p0,0 = 1−eon. During the energy outage period, all of the packets will be doubtlessly
lost.

2) 0 < l < L− 1: Note that from an arbitrary energy state l, we can only reach a single unit
of energy level, as illustrated in Fig. 2. For example, energy state l can only transit to l−1 (lower
energy) or l + 1 (higher energy), or remains in the same state l. The energy level will decrease
with probability pl,l−1 = δ(1 − eon) as long as the EH SU successfully detects the idle spectrum
when no energy is harvested. However, if the EH board harvests energy while the spectrum
is recognized as occupied, the energy level will increase with probability pl,l+1 = (1 − δ)eon.
Otherwise, the energy level l will be maintained with probability pl,l = (1 − δ)(1 − eon) + δeon.
3) l = L − 1: Despite much energy being harvested, the energy level L − 1 will remain
unchanged because the battery size is limited. However, the energy level will decrease with
probability pl,l−1 = δ(1 − eon) if no energy is harvested but idle spectrum is detected. Finally,
the battery will be fully charged with probability pl,l = 1 − δ(1 − eon).

Fig. 2 shows the Markovian battery model with the transition probabilities analyzed above. As

Fig. 2 illustrates, since all energy states communicate with each other, the proposed ﬁnite-state

Markovian model is irreducible and therefore positive recurrent. In addtion, starting in arbitrary

energy state l, we can enter state l at times 1, 2, 4, ..., so that the proposed model is aperiodic
because the minimum period is 1. Then, we can derive the steady state probability πl at the
energy state l by analyzing the equilibrium equation π = πP, where π is the vector consisting

of steady state probabilities and P denotes transition matrix and each of them is given as

Therefore, at the energy state l = 0, the equilibrium equation can be written as

π0eon = π1δ(1 − eon).

Furthermore, at the state l = 1, the analysis can be expressed as

π1 =

δ(1 − eon)

π1[δ(1 − eon) + (1 − δ)eon] = π0eon + π2δ(1 − eon).

By using (13), (15) can be simpliﬁed as

For an arbitrary state l satisfying 1 < l < L − 1, we know that the equilibrium equation is

given by

πl[δ(1 − eon) + (1 − δ)eon] = πl−1(1 − δ)eon + πl+1δ(1 − eon).

When energy state is l = 2, (17) will become

If sufﬁcient energy and ‘real’ idle spectrum are provided to EH SUs, secondary data will be

reliably transmitted without collisions; otherwise, the packet is most likely to be lost. Then we

deﬁne the probability of packet loss as

PL , 1 − (1 − π0) Pr (θm = 0,H0)

= 1 − (1 − π0) (1 − Pf (ε)) πi (qi, qo) .

(27)

Wireless channel varies in real-time and therefore channel estimation increases computational

complexity. Moreover, estimation errors are inevitable, so as to affect the accuracy of results.

Fortunately, faded signals can be normalized by improving the diversity performance of receiver.

Therefore, we assume that a single unit of energy guarantees reliable secondary transmission as

long as no collision occurs but it can be further extended to a speciﬁc wireless channel model.

IV. SIMULATION AND RESULTS

Monte-Carlo simulation is performed under different processes of energy arrival and primary

network, and numerical results are used to evaluate the proposed analysis. We mainly focus

on how the packet loss probability changes with the variations of primary SNR γp (Case I)
and normalized detection threshold ǫ/σ2
w (Case II). Table 1 provides the parameters utilized

throughout the simulation.

Figs. 3-4 illustrate the packet loss probability as a function of the primary SNR γp for {qo =

to P f = 0.01. Note that higher primary SNR improves reliability of spectrum sensing (Pd : 0 →
1). Therefore, miss detection rarely happens and more energy can be accumulated at the EH

SU with higher primary SNR. As a result, the EH SU rarely runs out of energy the packet loss

probability decreases accordingly as the primary SNR increases.

w that indicates the relative detection threshold compared to the noise power. Similarly,
old ε/σ2
{qo = 0.7, qi = 0.5} and {pon = 0.5, pof f = 0.7} are considered, and the primary SNR
is γp = −15 dB. As the normalized detection threshold increases, false alarm is improved
(Pf : 1 → 0), while miss detection happens more frequently (Pd : 1 → 0). At the begin-
ning, the number of secondary data packets lost is decreasing, since the access probability is

increasing. However, more frequent spectrum accessing results in energy outage and collisions.

Consequently, increasing the number of secondary data packets does not return a gain when the

normalized detection threshold keeps increasing.

Figs. 3-6 also show that the minimum and the maximum probabilities are achieved with

frequent energy harvesting and occasional spectrum accessing, respectively. In addition, no matter

how many PUs are involved to share resources with the EH SU, secondary packets are lost due

to the energy outage and the sensing inaccuracy since the EH SU cannot sense all spectrums

simultaneously and selects one of spectrums to sense. Finally, we explain the reason why the

packet loss probability becomes saturated, as follows. The access probability converges to a
constant as Pd → 1 when Pf is ﬁxed or both Pf and Pd simultaneously approach 0, so that the

energy outage probability becomes saturated.

V. CONCLUSIONS

To derive the probability of packet loss in the EH SUs, we have proposed a Markovian battery

model. Form the battery model, the energy outage probability was analyzed ﬁrst. Then the packet

loss probability due to sensing inaccuracy and energy outage was derived. Through the Monte-

Carlo simulation, the analysis was shown to be acceptable to predict the packet loss probability

and therefore can be applied to the cross layer optimization.
