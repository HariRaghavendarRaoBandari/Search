ABSTRACT
The gas in galaxy clusters is heated by shock compression through accretion (outer
shocks) and mergers (inner shocks). These processes additionally produce turbulence.
To analyse the relation between the thermal and turbulent energies of the gas under
the inﬂuence of non-adiabatic processes, we performed numerical simulations of cos-
mic structure formation in a box of 152 Mpc comoving size with radiative cooling,
UV background, and a subgrid scale model for numerically unresolved turbulence.
By smoothing the gas velocities with an adaptive Kalman ﬁlter, we are able to esti-
mate bulk ﬂows toward cluster cores. This enables us to infer the velocity dispersion
associated with the turbulent ﬂuctuation relative to the bulk ﬂow. For halos with
masses above 1013 M(cid:12), we ﬁnd that the turbulent velocity dispersions averaged over
the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and the intracluster medium (ICM) are
approximately given by powers of the mean gas temperatures with exponents around
0.5, corresponding to a roughly linear relation between turbulent and thermal energies
and transonic Mach numbers. However, turbulence is only weakly correlated with the
halo mass. Since the power-law relation is stiﬀer for the WHIM, the turbulent Mach
number tends to increase with the mean temperature of the WHIM. This can be at-
tributed to enhanced turbulence production relative to dissipation in particularly hot
and turbulent clusters.

Key words: methods: numerical – galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium – inter-
galactic medium – hydrodynamics – turbulence.

1 INTRODUCTION

In astrophysics, adiabatic and isothermal turbulence are two
important cases, corresponding to the limits of negligible
cooling on the one hand and extremely eﬃcient cooling
through radiation on the other hand. In the context of the
interstellar medium, the properties of isothermal compress-
ible turbulence have been thoroughly studied. In particu-
lar, many simulations of forced turbulence in periodic boxes
were performed to infer scaling relations and other statistics
(e. g. Kritsuk et al. 2007; Schmidt et al. 2009; Federrath
et al. 2010; Konstandin et al. 2015). In the isothermal case,
the dissipated energy is instantaneously radiated away. This
results in a ﬁxed ratio between the mean turbulent and ther-
mal energies, in which equilibrium between energy injection
and dissipation is maintained. In particular, this implies a
nearly constant root mean square (RMS) Mach number of
the turbulent ﬂow. Forced isothermal turbulence was revis-
ited for an expanding space with constant Hubble parameter

H by Schmidt et al. (2014). As long as the dynamical time
scale of turbulence is short compared to the Hubble time
1/H, however, the RMS Mach number remains steady.

In contrast to isothermal turbulence, stirring and dis-
sipation in adiabatic gas steadily raise the thermal energy,
which in turn causes a rapidly declining Mach number (see
Schmidt et al. 2006; Schmidt et al. 2014). The assumption of
adiabaticity was often used to approximate the dynamics of
the baryonic component in simulations of cosmic structure
formation. For example, mergers of dark-matter halos excite
large-scale motions through tidal forces, which are subse-
quently dissipated. Moreover, gas that is accreted from ﬁla-
ments and from the dilute medium in the void experiences
strong shock compression when it hits the denser medium
inside a galaxy cluster (the basic physics of shock-generated
turbulence is brieﬂy reviewed in Section 2). As a result, ac-
cretion and mergers heat the baryonic gas to temperatures
up to a few keV. These processes have been studied in a
variety of cosmological simulations (e. g. Ricker 1998; Nor-
man & Bryan 1999; Dolag et al. 2005; Maier et al. 2009;
Vazza et al. 2009; Iapichino et al. 2011; Paul et al. 2011;

2 W. Schmidt et al.

Vazza et al. 2011; Miniati 2014). However, the UV back-
ground radiation produced by galaxies acts as a tempera-
ture ﬂoor, thus limiting the shock strength compared to the
adiabatic case (McQuinn et al. 2009; Vazza et al. 2009).
At higher densities, radiative cooling reduces the tempera-
ture of shock-heated gas, particularly in the warm-hot in-
tergalactic medium (WHIM), but also in the intracluster
medium (ICM) (Katz et al. 1996; Faltenbacher et al. 2005;
Kang et al. 2007; Nagai et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2009; Borgani
& Kravtsov 2011; Smith et al. 2011; Iapichino et al. 2013;
Luki´c et al. 2015; Hahn et al. 2015). Since cooling is not
eﬃcient enough to remove excess heat on dynamically short
time scales, turbulence produced in clusters and ﬁlaments
evolves somewhere in between the isothermal and adiabatic
limits.

A key problem is how to identify turbulence in cosmo-
logical simulations and how to quantify its properties. The
aforementioned studies come up with a remarkable variety
of diﬀerent approaches. Norman & Bryan (1999) introduced
the standard deviation of the radial velocity in spherical
shells around the center of a cluster as a proxy for turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations. This method has been used in numerous
studies ever since. However, it ignores transversal velocity
ﬂuctuations and obviously fails if the gas distribution is not
spherically symmetric, for instance, in merging clusters or
in ﬁlaments. To separate random turbulent ﬂuctuations in
three dimensions from large-scale bulk motions caused by
the infall of gas into potential wells, Dolag et al. (2005) pro-
posed to calculate a mean velocity ﬁeld by smoothing the
velocity on a scale of a few 100 kpc. However, since tur-
bulence produced by cosmic structure formation is neither
statistically stationary nor homogeneous, it is not suﬃcient
to apply a universal smoothing scale for the calculation of
the mean ﬂow. This limitation led Vazza et al. (2012) to
the development of a ﬁltering technique, which locally de-
termines the coherence scale of the velocity ﬁeld. The turbu-
lent ﬂuctuation is then obtained by subtracting the coherent
component of the velocity. An alternative approach was ini-
tated by Maier et al. (2009), who applied a subgrid scale
(SGS) model to determine the numerically unresolved frac-
tion of the turbulent kinetic energy. However, their model
entirely neglected eﬀects caused by inhomogeneities and the
shear associated with bulk ﬂows. Apart from that, the SGS
turbulence energy varies with the grid resolution. For this
reason, it is not possible to infer the turbulent velocity dis-
persion integrated over the whole spectrum of ﬂuctuations.
This is also the case if the vorticity of the velocity ﬁeld is
used as indicator of turbulence, which is meaningful only
if the vorticity is calculated for a uniform grid resolution
scale (see, for example, Zhu et al. 2010; Iapichino et al.
2011; Miniati 2014). Miniati (2014, 2015) decomposes the ve-
locity ﬁeld into solenoidal and dilatational components and
computes structure functions to infer scaling laws for turbu-
lent velocity ﬂuctuations. Particularly on small scales, the
spatial velocity increments should be dominated by turbu-
lence. The integral-scale velocity ﬂuctuation following from
second-order structure functions provides a proxy for the
turbulent velocity dispersion, with the caveat that bulk ﬂows
are not subtracted.

In this article, we apply the shear-improved SGS model
implemented into the Nyx code (Almgren et al. 2013;
Schmidt et al. 2014) to compute the turbulent velocity dis-

persion in clusters and ﬁlaments. This model is applicable to
inhomogeneous turbulence and provides a measure of turbu-
lence with largely reduced dependence on numerical resolu-
tion and biases due to bulk ﬂows. As explained in Section 2,
an adaptive algorithm originating from the statistical theory
of signal processing is utilized to compute the mean veloc-
ity ﬁeld. Similar to the multi-scale ﬁltering method of Vazza
et al. (2012), the determination of the mean velocity is not
completely unambiguous and has to be tweaked by sensi-
ble parameter choices. While they employ ﬁltering only as a
postprocessing method, the shear-improved SGS model op-
erates dynamically. This allows us to incorporate the turbu-
lent stresses produced by numerically unresolved turbulent
eddies into the equations of gas dynamics. Moreover, artiﬁ-
cial changes in the internal energy induced by adaptive mesh
reﬁnement (AMR) are reduced.

The goal of this paper is to compute and to analyse
statistics of the thermal and turbulent energies of the gas in
a large sample of clusters, using the methodology outlined
above and explained in more detail in Section 3. In particu-
lar, we address the question if the turbulent Mach number
tends to be constant. Vazza et al. (2011) proposed a ratio of
0.27 between turbulent and thermal energies, corresponding
to a Mach number of about 0.7 for merger-driven turbu-
lence in cluster cores). By computing second-order struc-
ture functions for massive clusters, Miniati & Beresnyak
(2015) also found a nearly constant turbulent Mach number
in the ICM. Moreover, we investigate whether turbulence
approaches a statistically stationary state (balance of pro-
duction and dissipation, see Maier et al. 2009) and whether
there are systematic diﬀerences between the turbulent en-
ergy in the WHIM and ICM (Iapichino et al. 2011). The
improved treatment of cooling processes and the UV back-
ground implemented into Nyx by Luki´c et al. (2015) pro-
vides the basis for the accurate computation of the thermo-
dynamic state resulting from structure formation. However,
since we focus on turbulence driven by accretion and merg-
ers at low redshift, we do not incorporate feedback processes.
The impact of feedback on top of turbulence produced by
structure formation will be studied in a separate work. Af-
ter describing our simulation runs in Section 4, we carry
out a global analysis of gas properties (Section 5), followed
by statistics of the mean turbulent velocity dispersion and
temperature of the gas associated with halos of at least 1013
solar masses (Section 6). To get a handle on resolution de-
pendence and variations between diﬀerent clusters, we also
computed radial proﬁles (Section 7). The implications of our
results and open questions are discussed in Section 8.

2 SHOCK-GENERATED TURBULENCE

In the absence of galactic winds or AGN feedback, the domi-
nant source of turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM)
or ICM is the interaction of shocks produced during and
after the nonlinear gravitational collapse of baryons (e. g.
Kang et al. 2007; Ryu et al. 2008; Vazza et al. 2009; Paul
et al. 2011; Miniati 2014). Particularly at lower redshifts,
gas falling into the deep potential wells of clusters is accel-
erated to high peculiar velocities Uu ∼ 1000 km/s. Since the
temperature Tu of the low-density IGM from which gas is
accreted does not exceed a few 104 K, such velocities corre-

spond to hypersonic upstream Mach numbers Mu (cid:29) 1. As a
result, very strong shocks are produced (Miniati et al. 2000;
Ryu et al. 2003; Skillman et al. 2008). The Mach number
Ms with respect to the shocked gas follows from the jump
conditions for a strong shock:

(cid:18) γ − 1

(cid:19)1/2

Ms (cid:39)

,

2γ

(1)
giving Ms ∼ 0.45 for γ = 5/3. The shock-compressed gas is
the main constituent of the WHIM. Since accretion shocks
are located far outside the center of a cluster, the gas can still
gain kinetic energy by being pulled toward denser regions
of the cluster. Since the gas is also turbulent, however, ki-
netic energy is eﬃciently dissipated into thermal energy. For
this reason, the Mach number does not necessarily become
higher. If radiative cooling is taken into account, the dy-
namics becomes even more complex because now turbulent
heating competes with cooling, which may raise the Mach
number.

Apart from accretion, the gas in clusters is stirred by
mergers. For the subclass of merger shocks produced by
the motion of substructure halos within large virialized ha-
los (see, for example, Cen 2005; Subramanian et al. 2006;
Iapichino et al. 2008; Russell et al. 2014), a simple estimate
of the turbulent Mach number can be obtained by notic-
ing that both the typical velocity of the subhalo vv and the
sound speed in the gas of the larger halo cs are given by the
larger halo’s virial temperature (see also Faltenbacher et al.
2005),

implying a weak shock with upstream Mach number Mu ∼
(2/γ)1/2 ≈ 1.1 for γ = 5/3. The post-shock Mach number
Ms is also close to unity in this case. A more general analy-
sis of merger shocks, implying Mach numbers of order unity,
is presented in Gabici & Blasi (2003). In contrast to merg-
ers of clusters with comparable mass, numerical simulations
of minor mergers show that turbulence is mainly produced
in the turbulent wake of the subhalo (Iapichino et al. 2008;
Schmidt et al. 2015; Roediger et al. 2015), resulting in sub-
sonic turbulent Mach numbers. This is also suggested by
observations of Eckert et al. (2014).

Based on simple dimensional arguments, one can there-
fore expect that shock-generated turbulence is roughly tran-
sonic. However, local diﬀerences in the eﬃciency of trans-
forming downstream shock velocities into turbulence and
additional kinetic energy injection by gravity (i. e., accel-
eration toward the center of the gravitational well inside the
outer shocks and stirring through mergers) potentially vary
the turbulent energy, while the thermal energy of the gas
changes due to turbulent energy dissipation, gravitational
compression, and radiative cooling. The combined eﬀect of
these processes can only be studied with numerical simula-
tions and will be reﬂected in a large scatter of Mach num-
bers.

Hot and Turbulent Gas in Clusters

which has been developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. The code is based on the BoxLib framework
for block-structured adaptive mesh reﬁnement, which follows
the procedure outlined in Bell et al. (1994), with a multi-grid
solver for the computation of the gravitational potential and
optimal subcycling for the adaptive hydrodynamical time
step (Almgren et al. 2013). The positions and velocities of
the dark matter particles are evolved using a kick-drift-kick
sequence such as in Miniati & Colella (2007). To solve the
equations of gas dynamics in co-moving coordinates, an un-
split Godunov method with piecewise parabolic reconstruc-
tion is applied (Miller & Colella 2002).1 For a more realistic
treatment of the baryonic gas, we use an advanced treatment
of heating and cooling on cosmological scales, as detailed in
Luki´c et al. (2015). However, we do not consider contribu-
tions from feedback processes or magnetic ﬁelds here.

In cosmological simulations, it is commonly assumed
that a ﬂuid-dynamical description is applicable to the bary-
onic gas at least on suﬃciently large scales. Moreover, the
physical dissipation scale due to microscopic viscosity is as-
sumed to be unresolved in such simulations. In contrast to
implicit large eddy simulations (ILES), where the eﬀect of
turbulent diﬀusion and energy dissipation is solely treated
by the truncation error terms of the ﬁnite-volume discretiza-
tion, large eddy simulations (LES) with an explicit subgrid
scale (SGS) model approximate the kinetic energy of nu-
merically unresolved turbulence by an additional transport
equation (see Schmidt 2015 for a review). The additional
energy variable, which is called SGS turbulence energy, con-
stitutes a buﬀer between the numerically resolved kinetic
energy and the internal energy of the gas. For this rea-
son, it is also possible to apply an improved, energy- and
momentum-conserving AMR scheme, where artiﬁcial mod-
ulations of the internal energy due to grid reﬁnement or de-
reﬁnement are reduced (see Schmidt et al. 2014). Since the
turbulent diﬀusivity predicted by the SGS model allows us
to account for the enhanced transport of heat due to small-
scale turbulence, we incorporated a turbulent diﬀusion term
into the equation for the numerically resolved energy. Thus,
Nyx solves the following equations for the comoving bary-
onic density ρ, the proper peculiar velocity U (i. e., the
physical velocity minus the Hubble ﬂow), the numerically
resolved energy ρE = ρ(e + U · U /2), where ρe = p/(γ − 1)
is the internal energy of gas with pressure p and adiabatic
exponent γ, and the SGS turbulence energy ρK (Schmidt
et al. 2014):

tential resulting from the total density ﬁeld of baryonic and
dark matter. The combined rate of heating and cooling, ΛHC,
in equations (5) and (6) is computed for the time-varying
homogeneous ultraviolet background from Haardt & Madau
(2012) and radiative cooling due to hydrogen and helium

The non-linear interaction between numerically resolved

The quantity d = Uk,k is called the divergence of the velocity
ﬁeld.

To separate turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations from the
non-turbulent bulk motions, an adaptive Kalman ﬁlter is in-
troduced in Schmidt et al. (2014). While bulk motions are,
for instance, associated with large-scale accretion ﬂows into
the potential wells of clusters, turbulence is produced by ac-
cretion shocks and merger events. This separation leads to
the shear-improved SGS model (Cahuzac et al. 2010), which
allows us to calculate the turbulent velocity dispersion for
clusters without strong biases from bulk ﬂows:

(cid:48) 2 + 2K,

σ2
turb = U

(12)
where U(cid:48) = U − [U ] represents the ﬂuctuating component
of the numerically resolved ﬂow. The smoothed ﬂow velocity
[U ] is locally computed with an adaptive temporal Kalman
ﬁlter. In contrast to a simple low-pass ﬁlter, such as the ex-
ponential ﬁlter, this method has the advantage that no ﬁxed

smoothing scale is applied. It is therefore particularly suit-
able for inhomogeneous turbulent ﬂow. However, the adap-
tive algorithm requires guide parameters, which control the
behaviour of the ﬁlter if the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld settles into
equilibrium. In the statistically stationary limit, the ﬁlter
operates like an exponential low-pass ﬁlter with the char-
acteristic time scale Tc = 5 Gyr.2 By invoking ergodicity,
spatial scales could be associated with the time scale of the
ﬁlter. However, depending on the variability of the ﬂow, the
resulting length scales can range from the integral scale in
the case of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence to much
smaller scales for rapid spatiotemporal changes in the ﬂow,
for example, across accretion shocks.

The turbulent velocity dispersion predicted by our
model encompasses both resolved and subgrid scales. More-
over, it is possible to calculate the timescale of turbulence
production associated with energy transfer through the tur-
bulent cascade:

τ =

ρσ2

2Σ

.

(13)

For the simple eddy-viscosity closure applied in Schmidt
et al. (2014), the application of the shear-improved model
is straightforward. However, a subtlety arises when work-
ing with the mixed closure (10) for the turbulent stresses.
L´evˆeque et al. (2007) argue that the turbulence energy ﬂux
Σ should be linear in the derivative U(cid:48)
i,j of the ﬂuctuating
component. While this is naturally the case for the eddy-
viscosity term with the coeﬃcient C1, replacing Ui,j by U(cid:48)
i,j
in the non-linear term with the coeﬃcient C2 would result
in a quadratic dependence on the ﬂuctuating component.
We remove this inconsistency by observing that the main
function of the shear-improved treatment is to suppress tur-
bulence production in regions where shear is mainly due to
the bulk ﬂow. In this case, K should be small and the dom-
inant term is the ﬁrst term in the closure for τij. The non-
linear term, on the other hand, is only important in strongly
turbulent regions (see Schmidt & Federrath 2011), where lo-
cally isotropic developed turbulence can be assumed and the
shear-improved correction is small. For this reason, we de-
ﬁned the shear-improved SGS turbulence stress tensor as

2 See Schmidt et al. (2014) for a detailed explanation of the cali-
bration of the Kalman ﬁlter in the case of the Santa Barbara clus-
ter. Here, we use the parameters Tc = 5 Gyr and Uc = 300 km/s
for the predictor-corrector scheme. Compared to the Santa Bar-
bara cluster, we lowered Uc by 25 % to work with a value that
is representative for the turbulent velocity dispersion over a wide
range of overdensities (see the global phase plot for σturb vs. over-
density in Sect. 5). The time scale Tc, on the other hand, turned
out to be very robust. It is important to notice that Uc is not
simply a characteristic scale of the ﬂuctuating component (if that
were the case, the separation would be rather arbitrary). In fact,
a higher value of Uc results in a lower magnitude of U(cid:48). However,
if Uc is appropriately chosen, the resulting turbulent velocity dis-
persion should be roughly comparable to Uc in the statistically
stationary regime (see Schmidt et al. 2014; Schmidt 2015 for fur-
ther details).

4 SIMULATION RUNS

We use the Music code of Hahn & Abel (2011) to produce
cosmological initial conditions in a box of about 152 Mpc
comoving size, which is suﬃciently large to contain several
big clusters and major mergers (see Section 5). Following
the results of the Planck Collaboration et al. (2014), the
chosen cosmological density parameters are Ωm = 0.315 for
matter, Ωb = 0.0487 for the baryonic matter component,
and ΩΛ = 0.685 for the cosmological constant. The Hubble
parameter at z = 0 is H0 = 67.3 (km/s)/Mpc.

An overview of the runs performed with diﬀerent nu-
merical resolutions is given in Table 1. We varied both the
grid resolution and the number of dark matter particles and
applied reﬁnement criteria based on overdensity and vortic-
ity as described in Schmidt et al. (2014).3). Since turbulent
gas ﬁlls vast regions of space, which are bounded by the ac-
cretion shocks surrounding clusters and thick ﬁlaments, the
ﬁlling factors of reﬁned cells can grow above 60 % at the
ﬁrst reﬁnement level and to nearly 20 % at the second level.
This is why our simulations tend to be computationally quite
expensive. To appreciate the size of the simulations, the ef-
fective resolution and the ﬁlling factors at redshift z = 0 are
also listed in Table 1. Of course, higher spatial resolution
would be necessary if feedback processes from galaxies were
included. With a comparable computational budget, this can
be achieved by reducing the box size, applying less aggres-
sive reﬁnement strategies or zooming into selected clusters.
In this article, however, we focus on the statistics of a large
sample of big clusters at the high-mass end.

Figure 1 shows slices of the gas overdensity, the temper-
ature, and the SGS turbulence energy per unit mass for the
highest-resolution run in a diﬀerent plane. At z = 0 (bot-
tom panels), a network of several big clusters connected by
ﬁlaments can be seen. Close to the upper left corner of the
plane, a particularly massive and strongly turbulent clusters
is produced by a major merger between z ≈ 1.0 (upper pan-
els) and 0.5 (middle panels). The temperature in the ICM

3 However, an overdensity factor of at least 8 must be reached
in the current simulations, which implies that each of the new
cells at the next higher reﬁnement level contains the same mass

of the big clusters increases to several 107 K. The accretion
shocks in the cluster outskirts are indicated by a sharp drop
of the temperature. The slices of the speciﬁc SGS turbu-
lence energy show that signiﬁcant turbulence develops only
inside the accretion shocks. Similar to our previous simu-
lations of the Santa Barbara cluster (Schmidt et al. 2014),
the shear-improved SGS model avoids spurious SGS turbu-
lence energy production in the low-density gas outside the
accretion shocks, which show no signiﬁcant turbulence on
numerically resolved length scales.

The inﬂuence of numerical resolution is illustrated by
slices of the gas overdensity, the vorticity modulus, and the
SGS turbulence energy per unit mass in Fig. 2. We chose a
diﬀerent section through the box, showing an enormous com-
plex of clusters at z = 0. These clusters are about to merge.
Although the impact of the grid and particle resolution on
the structure of the cosmic web is palpable, the vorticity
ω = ∇ × U indicates turbulent gas in clusters for all res-
olutions. If the clusters are suﬃciently massive so that the
regions inside accretion shocks extend over many resolution
elements, turbulence is also indicated by high values of the
SGS energy K. For these clusters, one can see that K tends
to increase if the resolution is lowered because an increasing
fraction of turbulence energy resides in unresolved modes.
However, for small clusters or isolated galaxies, which are
only marginally resolved, little or no SGS energy can be seen
in the lowest-resolution run (top left slide in Fig. 2). This is
indicative of insuﬃcient resolution: If the dynamical range of
numerically resolved modes is too narrow, ﬂuctuations with
respect to the mean ﬂow calculated with the Kalman ﬁlter
are strongly damped by the truncation error of the numerical
scheme. In this case, the leading-order term in equation (14)
and, consequently, the growth of K are suppressed. We will
further elaborate on resolution requirements on the basis of
quantitative measures in Sections 6 and 7.

5 GLOBAL STATISTICS

In Figure 3, the heating of the gas due to mergers and shock
compression can be seen in phase diagrams showing the gas
mass in logarithmic bins of the baryonic overdensity ρ/ρ0
and the temperature T for redshifts ranging from z = 2.0
to 0.0. At z = 2.0, most of the gas can be found in two
branches. On the one hand, the rising polytrope for densi-
ties around the mean density stems from the UV background
resulting from the reionization model of Haardt & Madau
(2012). At high densities, on the other hand, the gas can
condense into an ISM-like phase of warm gas (Katz et al.
1996; Luki´c et al. 2015). Since we do not account for cooling
processes in the low-temperature phases of the ISM (galax-
ies are not resolved in our simulations), the high-density
branch asymptotically approaches 104 K. As cosmological
structure formation progresses, both branches are still visi-
ble, but an increasing amount of gas is heated to tempera-
tures much higher than 105 K. For z = 0.5 (bottom left plot
in Fig. 3), an accumulation of gas with overdensities above
∼ 103 and temperatures in the range from about 106 to sev-
eral 107 K is discernible, which corresponds to the ICM of
massive clusters. The gas at lower densities (ρ/ρ0 (cid:46) 100)
with temperatures above 105 K constitutes the warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM; see also Iapichino et al. 2011;

constrains the volume to regions inside the accretion shocks
and thick ﬁlaments, while the gas in the void and the gas
that condenses into the low-temperature and high-density
branch is excluded. In the diagram for z = 0.5 (bottom left

plot), the temperature and density bounds used in the fol-
lowing are indicated by the white dashed lines. The density
threshold ρ/ρ0 = 500 was chosen to separate WHIM and
ICM roughly along the depression between the two maxima
of the gas mass for temperatures T ∼ 106 K. In contrast

to Smith et al. (2011), we do not impose an upper tem-
perature bound of 107 K because a separate hot phase is
not motivated by the gas distribution that can be seen in
the phase diagrams. We rather see an increasing amount of
gas gradually spreading out over temperatures up to 108 K

with decreasing redshift. The very hot gas resides mainly in
the large clusters forming in our simulation. Moreover, we
separate the “warm” gas below T = 105 K into a tenuous
(ρ/ρ0 < 100) and a condensed (ρ/ρ0 > 100) phase to ac-
count for the major branches resulting from local equilibria

of heating and cooling (see also Luki´c et al. 2015). The gas
phases are further analyzed for diﬀerent halos in Section 6.

Since Fig. 1 suggests that mergers and accretion pro-
duce turbulence, hot overdense gas should be associated with
strong turbulence. The distribution of the turbulent veloc-
ity dispersion σturb deﬁned by equation (12) is shown in
Fig. 4 (left plot). Indeed, one can see that most of the gas
with ρ/ρ0 (cid:38) 10 is highly turbulent, with a typical veloc-
ity dispersion of few 100 km/s. Around the mean density
ρ0, there is a sharp drop to ∼ 1 km/s. The right plot in
Fig. 4 shows the ratio of the turbulence production rate Σ
(equation 8) to the dissipation rate ρ (equation9) against
the overdensity. A pronounced peak of the gas mass can be
seen at Σ/(ρ) ∼ 1 in the high-density range (ρ/ρ0 (cid:38) 103).
This implies an equilibrium between production and dissi-
pation in the ICM. In low-density gas, on the other hand,
turbulence is far oﬀ equilibrium. For a large fraction of gas
around the mean density, Σ/(ρ) (cid:29) 1, i. e., turbulence is

being produced while dissipation is still ineﬃcient. This is
in agreement with the small turbulent velocity dispersion at
low densities that can be seen in the left plot.

The Mach number σturb/cs associated with turbulence
has a supersonic and a transonic branch at high densities
(see Fig. 5). The diﬀerence of about 1.5 orders of magnitude
in the Mach numbers is roughly comparable to the three or-
ders of magnitude in temperature (T ∝ c2
s ), corresponding
to the cold-gas branch and the hot ICM in the phase dia-
gram. This implies a similar intensity of turbulence in both
phases. At moderate overdensities (WHIM), Mach numbers
around unity are dominant.

6 HALO STATISTICS

The relation between turbulence and temperature for clus-
ters can be quantitatively demonstrated by calculating mean

to the total mass of gas that has either temperatures above
105 K (WHIM and ICM) or an overdensity greater than 100
(condensed warm gas). Excluded is the tenuous warm gas
(T < 105 K and ρ/ρ0 < 100). The WHIM and ICM clearly
contain most of the gas mass, particularly for clusters with
halo mass greater than 1014 M(cid:12). The typical mass fraction
(see also Table 2) of the WHIM is about 50 %, which is
roughly comparable to the results obtained by Smith et al.
(2011) for a slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of the WHIM and a
smaller box size. However, we ﬁnd around 40 % of the gas
mass in the ICM of clusters, while Smith et al. (2011) re-
port less than 30 % mass at overdensities greater than 103
over the whole temperature range of their simulation. This
is a consequence of the substantially larger box used in our
simulations, which enables us to cover the high-mass range
above 1014 M(cid:12) and, thus, large clusters that undergo violent
mergers.5 For halos masses ∼ 1013 M(cid:12), a substantial frac-
tion of the gas mass can condense into the low-temperature
branch, which qualiﬁes these objects as galaxy-like. For a
realistic treatment, however, cooling processes below 104 K
and stellar feedback are necessary ingredients. This becomes
obvious when volume fractions are considered (right plot in
Fig. 6). The ICM and condensed warm gas ﬁll only a very
small fraction of the total volume (less than 1 %). This re-
ﬂects the fact that the outer shocks producing the WHIM
are found at much larger radii than the high-density gas in
the core (see also Section 7). Compared to the ICM, however,
the volume of the condensed warm gas is quite large, partic-
ularly for massive clusters. This is a signature of the overly
strong cooling ﬂows produced in the high-density cores in
the absence of feedback from AGNs and stars in galaxies.

los. We employed the halo ﬁnder implemented in yt (Turk
et al. 2011) to identify these regions. For each halo, a sphere
with radius 5Rhalo centered at the local density peak was
extracted, where Rhalo is the maximal radial distance of a
dark-matter particle belonging to the halo from its center.
The multiplication by 5 accounts for the much larger volume
enclosed by the outer shock fronts compared to the size of the
halo, as deﬁned by the halo ﬁnder. A factor of 5 turned out
to be a robust choice, which ensures that both the WHIM
and the ICM are contained in the spherical region, for which
averages are computed.

a large sample of halos in simulation A1. The halos are
grouped in logarithmic mass intervals of 0.5 dex. The most
massive objects with masses M > 1014 M(cid:12) correspond to
clusters, the less massive objects represent groups of galax-
ies or giant ellipticals. Halos with masses below 1013 M(cid:12) are
excluded because of the limited resolution of our simula-
tions. There is clearly a correlation between vorticity and
thermal energy, especially for the high-mass objects. For
M < 1013.5 M(cid:12), however, the scatter becomes large and
the slope appears to be tilted. A similar trend can be seen
for the RMS turbulent velocity dispersion in the right plot
in Figure 7. Power-law ﬁts to the data for M > 1013.5 M(cid:12)
result in the following relations:6

where (cid:104) (cid:105)ρ indicates a mass-weighted average. In both cases,
the exponent is about 0.5, which indicates that the squared

ture. However, since gradients are dominated by ﬂuctua-
tions on the grid scale, the vorticity in equation (15) de-
pends on numerical resolution. Equation (16), on the other

and

hand, provides a physically meaningful measure of turbu-
lence because σturb encompasses velocity ﬂuctuations on all
scales (numerically resolved and unresolved). Consequently,
the mean value of σturb is a scale-invariant integral quantity
(see also Schmidt et al. 2014). For some of the most massive
clusters, we thus ﬁnd turbulent velocity dispersions around
500 km/s and mean thermal energies ∼ 1 keV. The widely
spread data points for the diﬀerent mass groups in Fig. 7 also
demonstrate that turbulence is only weakly correlated with
the halo mass, although turbulence tends to be strong in the
most massive clusters (as indicated by the red diamonds in
the plots).

Since the gas density drops by several orders of magni-
tude from the density peak at the center of a cluster to its
outskirts, a mass-weighted average samples mainly the ICM.
This is conﬁrmed by calculating volume-weighted averages
with a weighing function that is constrained to the ICM, as
deﬁned at the beginning of Section 5. The resulting averages
are plotted in Figs 8 and 9. The results for the ICM are sim-
ilar to the mass-weighted averages, although the scatter is
larger. This is not surprising because the regions with over-
densities above the chosen threshold are quite small. The ﬁt
functions for halos with M > 1013.5 M(cid:12) are

Thus, the dependence on internal energy is stiﬀer than for
the ICM. In this case, more weight is put on the low-density
gas, which ﬁlls a much larger volume than the ICM. Be-
cause the temperature tends to be lower in the cluster out-
skirts, the values of (cid:104)e(cid:105)WHIM are systematically lower than
(cid:104)e(cid:105)ICM. The WHIM contributes to mass-weighted averages,
although with a lower weight than the ICM because of the
smaller gas mass in the WHIM. This explains why the mass-

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–21

weighted turbulent velocity dispersions are ﬁtted by a power
law (equation 16) in between the ﬁts to the ICM and the
WHIM data.

At higher redshifts, we ﬁnd similar power laws for the
turbulent velocity dispersion in the WHIM, where σturb =
666 km/s and 641 km/s for e = 1 keV at z = 0.5 and 1.0, re-
spectively (see Fig. 10). The mass threshold for the ﬁt func-
tion was lowered to 1013 M(cid:12) because of the smaller number
of very massive halos at higher redshifts. Thus, it appears
that there is no substantial evolution of the typical turbu-
lent velocity dispersion for a given mean thermal energy.
Compared to z = 0 (right plot in Fig. 9), however, both the
high-energy (i. e., mean thermal energy close to 1 keV) and
low-energy tails (below 0.1 keV) are less occupied. Partic-
ularly for halos of lower mass, the gas has not suﬃciently
cooled yet at z = 1. On the other hand, extremely hot clus-
ters also become increasingly rare at higher redshift. This

agrees with the redshift-dependent distribution of the gas in
the phase plots in Fig. 3.

The RMS vorticity and turbulent velocity dispersion
in the ICM and WHIM are plotted for runs with diﬀer-
ent grid and particle resolutions (see Table 1) in Figs 11
and 12, respectively. Shown are data points for all halos
in the mass decade below the maximal halo mass Mmax =
6.68 × 1014 M(cid:12). In the case of the ICM, both the vortic-
ity and the turbulent velocity dispersion are sensitive to the
grid resolution scale. While this is expected for the vorticity,
turb(cid:105) indicates that the
the resolution dependence of the (cid:104)σ2
ICM is not properly resolved in our simulations. However,
both ω and σturb suggest a trend of stronger turbulence with
increasing thermal energy. Such a trend clearly follows from
the data for the WHIM, for which the slopes of the power-
law ﬁts change only little with resolution. Only for the low-
est spatial resolution, the ﬁt for σturb deviates noticeably.
This conﬁrms the qualitative observation in Section 4 that
the LES method breaks down for smaller halos, for which

the turbulent energy is underestimated if the grid resolution
is too coarse. The power-law slopes obtained for the RMS
vorticity are more robust because the vorticity is directly
derived from the resolved velocity ﬁeld and does not rely on
the Kalman ﬁlter as additional layer. However, the vorticity
provides only a relative measure of turbulence, as its value
is determined by the grid resolution.7 In contrast, the tur-
bulent velocity dispersion computed with the Kalman ﬁlter
approximates the magnitude of turbulent velocity ﬂuctua-
tions in the energy-containing range, provided that a min-
imum resolution is reached. The data from our simulations
suggest that the required resolution is about 100 kpc for the
WHIM in massive clusters, while higher resolution is neces-

7 The smaller numerical smoothing scale at higher resolution
entails steeper gradients of the resolved turbulent velocity ﬁeld if
the microscopic viscosity is negligible. As a result, The vorticity
indeﬁnitely increases with numerical resolution, as long as the
physical dissipation scale is not resolved.

sary to obtain converged results for the ICM. Moreover, both
quantities show a weak trend with the number of reﬁnement
levels and particle resolution Np for a given spatial resolu-
tion ∆min, with slightly higher values for a larger number
of particles (A1 vs. B2), while no signiﬁcant changes of the
slopes are discernible. This might be caused by a larger, yet
sub-dominant contribution from minor mergers for a higher
number of dark-matter particles. The ICM data show similar
trends, however, obscured by a substantially larger scatter
(even in the most massive clusters, the ICM extends only
over a relatively small number of grid cells in our simula-
tions).

Since the relation σturb ∝ e0.5 ∝ cs corresponds to a
constant turbulent Mach number, equations (18) and (20)
imply that the RMS Mach number slowly decreases with the
ICM temperature, but increases with the temperature of the
WHIM. This is indeed demonstrated by the plots in Fig. 13,

Since the the downstream Mach-number decreases as the
adiabatic exponent approaches unity (isothermal limit, i. e.,
very eﬃcient radiative cooling), a Mach number of 0.77 can
be considered as an upper bound for shock-generated turbu-
lence. Figure 13 shows that the Mach numbers exceed this
bound for many clusters, which indicates sources of turbu-
lence production other than accretion shocks. Higher Mach
numbers, however, could also result from gradual cooling of
the shock-heated gas.

Trends also become evident by computing quartiles of

stant with a value slightly below 0.9, suggesting the relation
σturb ∝ e0.5. Although the value appears to vary with the
applied method of calculation, a constant Mach number in
the ICM is in agreement with the ﬁndings of Vazza et al.
(2011) and Miniati & Beresnyak (2015). The the lower ex-
ponent following from the least-square ﬁt to the ICM data
(equation 18) is probably a consequence of the insuﬃciently
resolved cluster cores (see Fig. 12). To better understand
the origin of the relatively high Mach numbers, it is help-
ful to analyze the statistics for the WHIM, for which both
Fig. 13 and the median values reveal a trend of increas-
ing Mach numbers for more turbulent and hotter clusters.
Remarkably, the ratio of turbulence production (Σ) and dis-
sipation (ρ) plotted in Fig. 14 also increases with the mean
energy of the WHIM. This implies that larger clusters with
higher turbulent Mach numbers experience stronger turbu-
lence production and tend to be more out of equilibrium,
i. e., the turbulence energy ﬂux through the cascade is not
matched by dissipation rate and turbulent energy is still
growing. The time scale τ = σ2
turb/(2) associated turbulent
energy dissipation, on the other hand, appears to be more
or less constant. As a result, stronger turbulence production
does not necessarily entail faster heating of the WHIM and
the Mach number could indeed rise. By investigating the
dependence of the eﬀective cooling rate ΛHC on the temper-
ature at overdensities that are representative for the WHIM,

it follows that ΛHC increases with temperature above 106 K
(roughly 0.1 keV). If the mean temperature of the WHIM
is around 106 K, which is only the case for some low-mass
halos in our sample, the cooling rate has a local minimum
and changes only little with temperature. This implies that
radiative cooling does at least not counteract the trend seen
for the turbulence production rate: Stronger turbulence pro-
duction and more eﬃcient radiative cooling tend to raise the
turbulent Mach number in halos with hotter WHIM. More-
over, there appears to be a plateau for halos with masses
above 1014 M(cid:12), with Mturb ≈ 1.1. This might indicate sat-
uration, but the scatter, which is indicated by the interquar-
tile range (i. e., the range of values encompassed by 50 % of
the data points centered around the median), is too large to
ascertain such a subtle change in the trend.

7 CLUSTER PROFILES

To investigate the properties of individual clusters, we com-
puted radial proﬁles. Table 4 lists a sample of four clusters,
which are are among the top ten in mass. To begin with,
radial proﬁles are probes of the sensitivity on resolution. As
representative example, proﬁles of the two key quantities of
our analysis, the turbulent velocity dispersion σturb and the
thermal energy e, are plotted for a particular halo in Fig. 15.
The proﬁles of σturb agree very well for the diﬀerent runs,
which corroborates the results shown in Fig. 12. While the
thermal energy of the cluster outskirts are also very robust,

we ﬁnd a strong sensitivity to the grid resolution for the ICM
at radii smaller than about 1 Mpc. Basically, cooling creates
a central depression in the temperature proﬁle, which be-
comes deeper and narrower as the grid resolution increases.
As a consequence, signiﬁcantly higher core resolution would
be required. Moreover, only the incorporation of feedback
processes can ensure that overcooling is prevented and con-
verged temperature proﬁles are obtained in the cluster core
(Borgani & Kravtsov 2011; Kravtsov & Borgani 2012; Hahn
et al. 2015). However, it is important to notice that the vol-
ume, for which the thermal energy is nearly independent of
resolution, is of the order 103 times the innermost Mpc3.

For σturb, we ﬁnd the typical shape that was reported
by Schmidt et al. (2014) for the Santa Barbara cluster: The
proﬁle of σturb is rather ﬂat in the interior of each cluster
and rapidly drops at the accretion shocks, which are located
at radii of almost 10 Mpc (the shocked gas extends further
outwards than the radius Rhalo of the dark matter halo).
The turbulent velocity dispersion of these large clusters can
reach 1000 km/s close to the center, whereas the mean val-
ues listed in Table 4 are not quite as large. The dynam-
ical time scale τ deﬁned by equation (13) assumes values
around 5 Gyr for R ∼ 1 Mpc for all clusters (top right plot
in Fig. 16). The pronounced peaks of 1/τ between 4 and
8 Mpc are induced by accretion shocks. This demonstrates
that turbulence is indeed eﬃciently generated by shocks, as
previously shown by Kang et al. (2007); Ryu et al. (2008);
Vazza et al. (2009); Paul et al. (2011); Miniati (2014). Since
Kang et al. (2007) and Ryu et al. (2008) deﬁne a dynamical

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–21

time scale τ in terms of the vorticity, their statement that τ
assumes a typical value in terms of the Hubble time depends
on the chosen grid scale. In contrast, equation (13) provides
a deﬁnition independent of the grid resolution (see Schmidt
et al. 2014). In the center of the clusters, the production
rate Σ (see equation 8) can become negative, which implies
strong backscattering from subgrid to resolved scales. The
strong ﬂuctuations at small radii are a consequence of the
small number of grid cells, over which data are averaged. The
bottom plots show proﬁles of the Mach numbers σturb/cs and
U/cs associated with turbulence and the resolved ﬂow, re-
spectively. While the turbulent Mach numbers are mostly
subsonic or transonic in the clusters, there is a steep rise
to supersonic values around the accretion shocks, which is
overcompensated by the rapidly decreasing turbulent veloc-
ity ﬂuctuation at larger radii. The Mach numbers associated
with the total velocity U , on the other hand, increase to ex-
tremely high values (see Borgani & Kravtsov 2011). This is
caused by the contribution from the accretion of cold gas,
which falls with very high speed toward the massive clusters.

The diﬀerent contributions to the speciﬁc energy are
plotted for the four selected halos in Fig. 17. By comparing
U 2/2 (total resolved kinetic energy) and U(cid:48) 2/2 (resolved
turbulent energy), it can be seen that a large fraction of
the kinetic energy is turbulent inside the accretions shocks,
but dominated by bulk motions in the exterior medium. The
SGS energy K contributes a small, but non-negligible frac-
tion of the turbulent kinetic energy. Moreover, U(cid:48) 2 ∼ e

Mach numbers of the order unity in the WHIM (see Ta-
ble 4). However, eﬃcient cooling in the cluster core substan-
tially reduces the temperature (Luki´c et al. 2015), producing
a characteristic dip in the internal energy proﬁle, which is
particularly pronounced for halos 3 and 6 in Fig. 17, and
an increase of the Mach number toward the center (see bot-
tom left plot in Fig. 16). This also aﬀects the mean Mach
numbers of the ICM. The ﬂatter internal energy proﬁles for
or halos 1 and 10 reﬂect the heat released by recent major
mergers.

Figure 18 shows how the distribution of the gas among
the phases deﬁned in Sect. 5 changes with radius. In con-
trast to the mean gas fractions plotted in Fig. 6, the volume
fractions are normalized to the total volume, including low-
density gas in the void. The WHIM ﬁlls nearly all the cluster
volume enclosed by the outer shocks. The residual WHIM
fraction outside of the accretion shocks stems from other
nearby clusters or ﬁlaments extending further outwards. At
radii between 0.6 and 0.9 Mpc, the ICM fraction crosses the
WHIM fraction. Although there is no sharp separation be-
tween WHIM and ICM, the cluster core is clearly dominated
by the ICM. The applied deﬁnitions are therefore sensible.

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–21

Halo 10 is unusual, as a non-negligible amount of warm-
hot gas is mixed into the core, which is another indication
of recent merging. Moreover, for all halos the ICM fraction
is does not monotonically decrease with radius. There are
peaks corresponding to small volume fractions of an ICM-
like phase and condensed warm gas at radii of several Mpc,
which can be attributed to subhalos merging with the clus-
ter (inside the accretion shock) or subhalos in the vicinity
of the cluster.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed thermal and turbulent properties of the bary-
onic gas in galaxy clusters by running simulations of cosmic
structure formation with the method of adaptively reﬁned
large eddy simulations introduced in Schmidt et al. (2014).
We used the treatment of radiative heating and cooling of
Luki´c et al. (2015) to evolve baryonic gas from initial condi-
tions produced with Music (Hahn & Abel 2011), assuming
the ΛCDM parameters established by the Planck mission.
We neglected feedback processes, which foremost rely on

heuristics. This allowed us to apply relatively well known
and numerically controllable physics. As an indicator of tur-
bulence, the ﬂuctuating component of the numerically re-
solved peculiar velocity is calculated with a Kalman ﬁltering
algorithm. In addition, the numerically unresolved compo-
nent is determined by a subgrid scale model for compressible
turbulence (Schmidt & Federrath 2011). Both components
are used to obtain an estimate of the turbulent velocity dis-
persion σturb in clusters. As opposed to previous methods
for approximating the turbulent velocity and associated time
scales in clusters (e. g. Norman & Bryan 1999; Dolag et al.
2005; Kang et al. 2007; Maier et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2010),
our deﬁnition of σturb respects the three-dimensional nature
of turbulence, does not depend on spherical symmetry, nor
is it subject to a particular choice of a spatial smoothing
length or resolution scale.

The radial proﬁles of σturb computed with the Kalman
ﬁlter and shear-improved subgrid-scale model are rather ﬂat
within a radius of a few Mpc from the density peak of a
cluster, with a sharp drop at the outer shocks (see Figs 16).
For relaxed clusters, we also see a strong peak of the inverse
dynamical time scale associated with the turbulent cascade
(basically, the turbulence energy ﬂux normalized by the en-

ergy). This indicates that accretion shocks not only heat the
infalling gas to high temperatures but also generate turbu-
lence. Indeed, radial proﬁles of the speciﬁc energy show that
both the thermal and turbulent energies are substantially
raised (Fig. 17). Qualitatively, our ﬁndings are in agreement
with previous studies by Ryu et al. (2008); Lau et al. (2009);
Paul et al. (2011); Vazza et al. (2011); Miniati (2014) and
others.

A global phase diagram of the turbulent Mach number
associated with σturb vs. overdensity shows a supersonic and
a transonic branch at high density (see Fig. 5). The former is
absent if only adiabatic gas dynamics is applied (see Fig. 20
in Schmidt et al. 2014) and can be understood as a conse-
quence of radiative cooling. Moreover, the Mach numbers
in the low-density gas tend to be lower because of the UV
background (Vazza et al. 2009). The eﬀect of cooling is also
reﬂected by a central dip of the thermal energy in cluster
proﬁles. Of course, feedback from galaxies aﬀects both the
thermal and turbulent energies of IGM. Although AGN feed-
back and supernova-driven winds cease to be major sources
of energy at low redshift, the cumulative mass fractions of
baryons plotted in Fig. 19 are indicative of strong overcool-
ing in the cores of all massive clusters in our simulations,

structure functions by Miniati (2014, 2015). Vazza et al.
(2011, 2013), on the other hand, calculated turbulent veloci-
ties that are lower by factors of about 2 to 3. This might be a
consequence of the preferred scales of their ﬁltering method,
which tend to be smaller than the integral scales reported by
Miniati (2015). Their method and ours, however, are likely
to bracket the physical turbulent velocity dispersion that is
characteristic for clusters.

The mean turbulent Mach numbers in the ICM lie
mainly in the subsonic range, particularly for hot and mas-
sive clusters (see Fig. 13). The expected Mach number would
be 0.8 or less if turbulence were solely generated by accre-
tion shocks. However, there are also halos with higher Mach
numbers, which can result from cooling in denser regions and
turbulence driven by mergers. The turbulent Mach numbers
implied by Vazza et al. (2011) are below 0.7. Similar or even
lower values were obtained, for example, by Lau et al. (2009);
Valdarnini (2011); Paul et al. (2011). Apart from the diﬀer-
ent methods of calculating the turbulent velocity dispersion,
the deviations might be caused by systematics related to the
simulations, such as the lack of radiative cooling or diﬀer-
ent box sizes favoring less violent evolution. On the other
hand, our results agree very well with the turbulent Mach
numbers calculated by Miniati & Beresnyak (2015), which
suggests that structure functions yield similar results for the
turbulent velocity dispersion as our approach. In the WHIM,
we typically ﬁnd transonic or mildly supersonic turbulence.
There is a weak trend of higher Mach numbers in hotter gas,
which requires an overcompensation of the higher thermal
energy by turbulence energy injection. This is indeed seen
for the mean contribution of turbulence production relative
to dissipation into thermal energy.

At least for the ICM, an observational determina-
tion of the relation between thermal and turbulent ener-
gies should become feasible with high-precision X-ray spec-
troscopy (Sanders et al. 2011; Zhuravleva et al. 2011). How-
ever, relations such as equation (16) must be interpreted
with care in an observational context. First of all, the step
from the mass-weighted or constrained averages applied in
our work to the temperature and density dependence of X-
ray emissions is far from straightforward. Another issue is
that observed line broadening in clusters typically selects a
scale that is given by the angular resolution of the instru-
ment, while we consider quantities that are by deﬁnition
scale invariant (with some residual dependence on numerical
resolution). A link could be provided by the subgrid scale en-
ergy, which speciﬁes turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations below a
particular scale. This scale is given the local grid resolution.
In AMR simulations, subgrid scale energies are available for
the whole grid hierarchy. Thus, one could interpolate to any
given scale bracketed by the resolution of the highest re-
ﬁnement level and the root grid. If cosmological simulations
are performed with many reﬁnement levels, the accessible
range of length scales will be ∼ 10 kpc to ∼ 1 Mpc. This
encompasses typical spatial resolutions of upcoming cluster
observations, for example, with Astro-H.

i.e. the pressure support of the gas against gravity is too
weak. Hahn et al. (2015) demonstrated that AGN feedback
is essential to reproduce observed properties of the ICM in
cluster cores. However, it is not completely clear yet how a
consistent treatment of turbulent energy injection, indepen-
dent of the grid resolution, can be achieved in cosmological
simulations (see, for example, Br¨uggen & Scannapieco 2009;
Borgani & Kravtsov 2011; Yang et al. 2012; Vazza et al.
2013; Hahn et al. 2015).

To analyze the turbulent velocity dispersion and Mach
numbers in diﬀerent clusters, we applied a halo ﬁnder and
computed mean values for the gas associated with the dark
matter halos. The gas is separated into the ICM deﬁned
by baryonic overdensities ρ/ρ0 > 500 and the WHIM with
ρ/ρ0 < 500. In both cases a temperature threshold of
T = 105 K is applied. We ﬁnd power laws for the mean tur-
bulent velocity dispersion as a function of the mean thermal
energy of the gas (equations 18 and 20), where the slope is
about 0.4 for the ICM, while the relation for the WHIM is
stiﬀer, with an exponent of almost 0.7 (the slope would be
0.5 if the Mach numbers were constant for all clusters). A
power law with an intermediate slope follows for the mass-
weighted mean values. However, the slope for the ICM is not
converged in our simulations because of the lack of resolution
in the cluster cores, which is severely limited if reﬁnement
on the magnitude of the vorticity is applied throughout the
domain. The resolution trend suggests that the correct expo-
nent is close to 0.5, indicating a constant ratio of thermal and
turbulent energies in the ICM. At redshift z = 0, the highest
mean thermal energies of the ICM are of the order 1 keV and
the corresponding turbulent velocity dispersion is roughly
400 km/s. Values above 500 km/s are found in rare cases.
Such clusters are typically very massive, but the scatter of
the turbulent velocity dispersions in terms of the dark halo
mass is very large, particularly at the lower-mass end. The

turbulent velocity dispersions σ2
our simulations are comparable to the integral-scale velocity
ﬂuctuations following from the computation of second-order
