ABSTRACT
In anticipation of the Gaia astrometric mission, a large sample of spectroscopic binaries
has been observed since 2010 with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute–Provence
Observatory. Our aim is to derive the orbital elements of double-lined spectroscopic
binaries (SB2s) with an accuracy suﬃcient to ﬁnally obtain the masses of the com-
ponents with relative errors as small as 1 % when the astrometric measurements of
Gaia are taken into account. In this paper we present the results from ﬁve years of
observations of 10 SB2 systems with periods ranging from 37 to 881 days. Using the
todmor algorithm we computed radial velocities from the spectra, and then derived
the orbital elements of these binary systems. The minimum masses of the components
are then obtained with an accuracy better than 1.2 % for the ten binaries. Combin-
ing the radial velocities with existing interferometric measurements, we derived the
masses of the primary and secondary components of HIP 87895 with an accuracy of
0.98% and 1.2% respectively.

INTRODUCTION

Mass is the most crucial input in stellar internal structure
modelling. It predominantly inﬂuences the luminosity of a
star at a given stage of its evolution, and also its lifetime.
The knowledge of the mass of stars in a non-interacting bi-
nary system, together with the assumption that the com-
ponents have same age and initial chemical composition, al-
lows the age and the initial helium content of the system
to be determined and therefore to characterize the structure
and evolutionary stage of the components. Such modelling
provides insights into the physical processes governing the

structure of the stars. Moreover provided masses are known
with great accuracy (Lebreton 2005), it gives constraints
on the free physical parameters of the models. Therefore,
modelling stars with extremely accurate masses (at the 1 %
level), in diﬀerent ranges of masses, would allow to ﬁrmly
anchor the models of the more loosely constrained single
stars.

This paper is the third in a series dedicated to the
derivation of accurate masses of the components of double-
lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) with the forthcoming as-
trometric measurements from the Gaia satellite. In paper I
(Halbwachs et al. 2014), we have presented our program to
derive accurate masses from Gaia and from high-precision
spectroscopic observations. We have selected a sample of
68 SB2s for which we expect to derive very precise in-
clination with Gaia, and M sin3 i with the Spectrographe

pour l’Observation des PH´enom`enes des Int´erieurs Stellaires
et des Exoplan`etes (SOPHIE spectrograph, Haute-Provence
Observatory). Our objective is to determine for these SB2
systems the masses of the two components with an accu-
racy about 1 %. We have been observing these stars since
2010 with SOPHIE. A ﬁrst result of our program was the
detection of the secondary component in the spectra of 20
binaries which were previously known as single-lined (pa-
per I). A second result was the determination of masses for
2 SB2 with accuracy between 0.26 and 2.4 %, using astro-
metric measurements from PIONIER and radial velocities
from SOPHIE (paper II).

Here, we present the accurate orbits measured for 10
SB2s (Table 1) with periods ranging from 37 to 881 days. Af-
ter 5 years of observations with SOPHIE, we collected a to-
tal of 123 spectra. In addition, a large number of previously
published measurements is available for each of them in the
SB9 catalog (Pourbaix et al. 2004). Four of these targets are
new SB2 identiﬁed in paper I, and previously known as SB1.
Finally, we combined the radial velocity (RV) measurements
of one star (HIP 87895) with existing interferometric mea-
surements and derive the masses of the two components.

The observations are presented in Section 2. The
method of measurements of radial velocities from SOPHIE’s
observations is explained in Section 3. We derive the or-
bital solutions in Section 4, discussing in particular the is-
sue of the uncertainties when combining diﬀerent datasets
from diﬀerent instruments. The derivation of the masses of
HIP 87895 is discussed in Section 5. Finally, we summarize
and conclude on our ﬁndings in Section 6.

2 OBSERVATIONS

The observations were performed at the T193 telescope of
the Haute-Provence Observatory, with the SOPHIE spec-
trograph. SOPHIE is dedicated to the search of extrasolar
planets, and, thanks to its high resolution (R∼75, 000), it
enables accurate stellar radial velocities to be measured for
SB2 components.

The spectra were all

reduced through SOPHIE’s
pipeline, including localization of the orders on the frame,
optimal order extraction, cosmic-ray rejection, wavelength
calibration, ﬂat-ﬁelding and bias subtraction. The minimum
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 40 for the faintest stars of the
sample, but it may be as large as 150 for a 6-magnitude
star. Before each observation run ephemerides were de-
rived from existing orbits provided by the SB9 catalogue
(Pourbaix et al. 2004), and priority classes were assigned on
the basis of the orbital phase. Four classes were used: the
lowest priority corresponds to stars with expected RVs of
primary and secondary component suﬃciently diﬀerent to
permit accurate measurements, and the highest priority is
reserved to the observations of the periastron of eccentric
orbits.

Among all the observed SB2, we have selected those
which were observed over at least one period, and which re-
ceived a minimum of 11 observations. Table 1 summarizes
this information. Given the very high quality of the mea-
surements, an SB2 orbit could be derived in principle from
only 6 of those observations, provided they were made at the
most relevant phases. However, we show in Section 4 that 11

3 RADIAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS

The radial velocities of the components are derived us-
ing the TwO-Dimensional CORrelation algorithm todcor
(Zucker & Mazeh 1994; Zucker et al. 2004). It calculates
the cross-correlation of an SB2 spectrum and two best-
matching stellar atmosphere models, one for each compo-
nent of the observed binary system. This two-dimensional
cross-correlation function (2D-CCF) is maximized at the ra-
dial velocities of both components. The multi-order version
of todcor, named todmor (Zucker et al. 2004), determines
the radial velocities of both components from the gathering
of 2D-CCF obtained from each order of the spectrum.

All SOPHIE multi-orders spectra were corrected for the
blaze using the response function provided by SOPHIE’s
pipeline; then for each of them, the pseudo-continuum
was detrended using a p-percentile ﬁlter (paper II, or e.g.
Hodgson et al. (1985)).

For both components of each binary, we determined a
best-matching theoretical spectra from the PHOENIX stel-
lar atmosphere models (Husser et al. 2013). We optimized
the 2D-CCF with respect to eﬀective temperature Teﬀ, ro-
tational broadening v sin i, metallicity [Fe/H], surface grav-
ity log(g), and ﬂux ratio at 4916 ˚A, α=F2/F1. Further-
more, each theoretical spectrum is convolved with the instru-
ment line spread function, here modeled by a Gaussian, and
pseudo-continuum detrended like the observed spectrum.
The spectral parameters obtained through this method are
given in Table 2. We determined spectral parameters from
4 spectra per binary on average, with the two components
well individualized. The values and their uncertainties given
in Table 2 are the average and standard deviation of the
individual estimations. The 1σ uncertainties do not include
known systematics of theoretical models with respect to real
spectral types (see e.g. Torres et al. (2012)).

a A null value is given to V sin i with no error bar whenever
found less than SOPHIE’s typical pixel size ∼2km s−1.

It is worth mentioning that the derived metallicity
[Fe/H] is systematically subsolar. Optimizing the CCF of
several spectra of the Sun obtained by observing Vesta and
Ceres with SOPHIE gave spectral parameters consistent
with the known values for the Sun except metallicity that
was found to be -0.33 dex. However, we kept the values of
metallicity that maximized the 2D-CCF, as given in Table 2.
We then applied todmor to all multi-order spectra of
each target and determined the radial velocities of both com-
ponents discarding all orders harboring strong telluric lines.
For each of the non-discarded orders, we calculated a two
dimensional cross-correlation function, and used the maxi-
mum of this function to derive radial velocities for the pri-

mary and the secondary. Final velocities for each component
are obtained by averaging these measurements and incorpo-
rating a correction for order-to-order systematics – typically
200-500 m s−1. The ﬁnal velocities are displayed in Table 3.
They are used to derive the orbital solutions for the 10 SB2
in the next section.

4 DERIVATION OF THE ORBITS

The orbital solutions for the 10 SB2 are derived by com-
bining the new measurements presented in this paper with
previously published RVs (references in Table 4).

Since several datasets coming from diﬀerent instru-
ments are used together to derive a common orbital solu-
tion, realistic errors should be attributed to each dataset
properly. It is explained in the following section. This pro-
cess guarantees that each dataset receives the proper weight
with respect to all others, including the new SOPHIE mea-
surements presented here.

4.1 Correction of uncertainties

Uncertainties of previously published measurements, when
provided, are usually underestimated. On the other hand,
many lists of RV measurements do not include uncertain-
ties, but only weights (W). Therefore, two diﬀerent proce-
dures are applied to attribute correct uncertainties to these
retrieved measurements. They are both based on the calcu-
lation of the F2 estimator of the goodness-of-ﬁt (see Paper II,
equation 1, or Stuart & Ord 1994):

• When the uncertainties are provided, a noise is quadrat-
ically added to the original uncertainties, in order to get
exactly F2=0 for the SB1 orbit of each component. Since
the original uncertainties are underestimated, this results in
decreasing the variations of the relative weights of the mea-
surements of a given component.

• When only weights are given, they are ﬁrst converted
to uncertainties (σ = p1/W ). Then they are scaled in order
to get F2=0 for the SB1 orbit of each component.

After this transformation, the SB2 orbit is derived, and
F2 is considered again. The ﬁnal uncertainties are obtained
by multiplying the ones derived above with a factor chosen
in order to get F2=0. All these operations result in applying
the following formulae:

RV,1 = ϕ1 × qσ2
σcorr
RV,2 = ϕ2 × qσ2
σcorr

RV,1 + ε2
1

RV,2 + ε2
2

(1)

(2)

Table 4 lists the derived values of the correction terms

ϕ1, ϕ2, ε1 and ε2 for all stars of our sample.

The same procedure is applied to the uncertainties de-
rived by todmor for the new measurements. For two bi-
naries (HIP 67195 and HIP 100321), the SB1 orbit of the
secondary component leads to a negative value of F2, im-
plying that the uncertainties are slightly overestimated. In
order to get F2=0, we prefered to keep the relative weights
ﬁxed, and simply multiply the uncertainties by a coeﬃcient
ϕ2 lower than 1.

All the RV measurements and the uncertainties used
in the derivation of the orbits will be available through the
SB9 Catalogue (Pourbaix et al. 2004), which is accessible
on-line1.

4.2 Derivation of the orbital elements

For each binary, we ﬁtted an SB2 orbital model to the
previously published datasets combined with the new SO-
PHIE observations. The parameters were optimized using a
Levenberg-Marquard method.

The ﬁnal orbital solution consists in the following or-
bital elements: the period, P , the eccentricity, e, the epoch
of the periastron, T0, the longitude of the periastron for
the primary component, ω1, the RV semi-amplitudes of each
component, K1 and K2, and the RV of the barycentre, V0.
We also added 3 supplementary parameters, which are:
a systematic oﬀset between the measurements previously
published and the new ones, dn−p, and the oﬀsets be-
tween the RVs of the primary and of the secondary com-
ponent, dp
2−1 is usually due to

the fact that the published RVs were obtained from tem-
plates which are not speciﬁcally adapted to each compo-
nent. For instance, a spectrovelocimeter like CORAVEL
(Baranne, Mayor & Poncet 1979) was working by projecting
any spectrum on a mask representing the spectrum of Arc-
turus. The oﬀset between the primary and secondary RVs
derived with todmor, dn
2−1 is expected to be null, but it is
signiﬁcant for some stars, since the spectra of the PHOENIX
library do not perfectly represent the actual ones.

4.3 Results

Even with a correction, the uncertainties of the measure-
ments from SOPHIE remain small and have weights much
larger than the others. Therefore, incorporating the pub-
lished datasets in the calculation essentially improved the
accuracy of the period determined. Conversely, the signiﬁ-
cant precision of the new SOPHIE measurements allowed us
to reach a very good accuracy on all other orbital parame-
ters, especially the minimum masses.

The derived orbital elements for the 10 SB2 are given
in Table 5. Among the 20 component stars, 15 of them have
M sin3 i determined with an accuracy better than 0.7 %,

Table 5. The orbital elements derived from the previously published RV measurements and from the new ones. The radial velocity of
the barycentre, V0, is in the reference system of the new measurements of the primary component. The minimum masses and minimum
semi-major axes are derived from the true period (Ptrue = P × (1 − V0/c)).

5 COMBINED ORBITAL SOLUTION AND

MASSES FOR HIP 87895

A comparison between the standard deviation of the
residuals of the previous measurements and of the new ones
also illustrates the improvements due to SOPHIE. It results
from the last column of Table 5 that σ(O − C)p is between
2.3 and 239 times larger than σ(O − C)n, with a median
around 30.

The orbital solutions, including previously published
measurements, are displayed on Fig. 1. The (O − C) residu-
als are included in Table 3 and are plotted on Fig. 2. We do
not observe any drift for any of the 10 SB2.

HIP 87895 is the close visual binary (VB) MCA 50. Among
the many observations recorded in the on-line Fourth Cat-
alogue of Interferometric Measurements of Binary Stars2,
we found 3 very accurate long-base interferometric measure-
ments performed with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer
(PTI). Since the RV measurements are already providing
parameters common to the spectroscopic and to the visual
orbits, three 2-dimension measurements are quite suﬃcient
to derive the remaining ones, which are: the orbital inclina-
tion, i, the position angle of the nodal line, Ω, and the ap-

parent semi-major axis or the trigonometric parallax (both
may equally be used).

These measurements and the rescaled error ellipsoids
provided by Muterspaugh et al. (2010) are taken into ac-
count simultaneously with our RV measurements, in order
to directly derive the masses of the components and the
trigonometric parallax of the system.

The results are given in Table 6, and in Fig. 3. We
derived the two masses with accuracies of 1.2 and 0.98 %,
respectively.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We obtained for 10 SB2 new radial velocity measurements
from spectra taken with SOPHIE, among which four new
SB2 identiﬁed in paper I. The todmor algorithm was used
to separate the two components in each spectrum. All ten
systems had previously published measurements in archive,

which we added to our measurements to calculate the or-
bital solutions. We also derived estimations of stellar pa-
rameters obtained by optimizing the two dimensional cross-
correlation obtained with todmor.

We achieved the objective of deriving minimum mass
with an accuracy better than 1% for 15 of the 20 stars of
our SB2 sample. Moreover, all ten binaries have the mini-
mum mass of both components estimated with relative un-
certainties lower than 1.2%. This is a great achievement of
the combination of todmor and SOPHIE. Especially it did
very well in extreme conﬁgurations such as with small SNR
(∼40), and very small ﬂux ratio (α<0.05) between the two
components.

We combined our RV measurements of HIP 87895
with 3 relative positions derived from long-based in-
terferometric observations, and we obtained new mass
estimate of the components, M1=1.132±0.014 M⊙ and
M2=0.7421±0.0073 M⊙. On the basis of
speckle ob-
(1995) previously derived
servations, McAlister et al.
M1=1.16±0.12 M⊙ and M2=0.77±0.05 M⊙, i.e. with rela-
tive errors of 10 and 6 %. Therefore, our measurements re-
ﬁne proﬁtably to the 1% level the conﬁdence range on the
masses of HIP 87895.

Added to the systems observed with Pionier, we have
now 3 binaries observed with SOPHIE which may be used
to check the masses that will be derived from Gaia.
