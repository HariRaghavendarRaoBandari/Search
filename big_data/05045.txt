Abstract

λ, a deformation of R3, supports a 3-parameter family of
The noncommutative space R3
gauge theory models with gauge-invariant harmonic term, stable vacuum and which
are perturbatively ﬁnite to all orders. Properties of this family are discussed. The
partition function factorizes as an inﬁnite product of reduced partition functions, each
one corresponding to the reduced gauge theory on one of the fuzzy spheres entering
the decomposition of R3
λ. For a particular sub-family of gauge theories, each reduced
partition function is exactly expressible as a ratio of determinants. A relation with
integrable 2-D Toda lattice hierarchy is indicated.

1 Introduction

In Noncommutative Geometry (NCG) [1], one basic idea is to set-up a kind of duality
between spaces and associative algebras so that topological, metric, diﬀerential properties
of the space have an algebraic description. A commutative example of such a duality
is provided by the Gelfand-Naimark duality between commutative (C∗-)algebras and lo-
cally compact Hausdorﬀ spaces. When the algebra is no longer commutative, suitable
algebraic translation of notions belonging to diﬀerential geometry and algebraic topology
permits one to deﬁne their natural noncommutative analogs so that the noncommuta-
tive algebra may be viewed as modeling a ”noncommutative space”, in the spirit of the
Gelfand-Naimark duality. Many of the building blocks of physics actually ﬁt well with
basic concepts of NCG which may ultimately provide eﬃcient tools to improve our un-
derstanding of spacetime at short distance. One argument sometimes put forward is that
NCG may provide a way to escape physical obstruction to the existence of continuous
space-time and commuting coordinates at the Planck scale [4]. This argument (which
however should be only regarded as indicative) has reinforced the interest in noncommu-
tative ﬁeld theories (NCFT).

NCFT appeared in their modern formulation in String ﬁeld theory [5], followed by
models on the fuzzy sphere and almost commutative geometries [6], [7]. NCFT on non-
commutative Moyal spaces received a lot of attention from the end of the 90’s, in particular
from the viewpoint of their renormalisation properties 1. For reviews, see for instance [8].
The renormalisation of NCFT is not an easy task since most of them are non local which
precludes the use of any standard treatment devoted to usual local quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries. This may even be complicated by additional peculiarities, among which the so called
UV/IR mixing for NCFT built on the popular Moyal space R4
θ which appears already in
the R-valued ϕ4 model [9]. A family of scalar models, known generically as the Grosse-
Wulkenhaar model, was shown to be perturbatively renormalisable to all orders [10] at
the beginning of the 2000’s. Various of its properties have been then investigated [11]-[16].
Notice that Moyal spaces can support causal structures. Actually, the Moyal plane R2
θ
admits a non trivial causal structure between coherent states [17], thus providing a coun-
terexample to some recent claims against any causality in Moyal spaces. Such a causal
structure extends very likely to a much wider class of states of R2
θ as well as to
various noncommutative spaces, among which the one considered in this paper which per-
tains to the group (C∗)-algebras. Note that the notion of causality used in [17] stems from
Lorentzian spectral triple and reduces to the usual notion of causality when the algebra
is commutative. NCFT on other noncommutative spaces, such as noncommutative tori,
κ-Minkowski spaces [18] have also been considered but their perturbative properties are
not so widely explored, in particular for the κ-Minkowski case due to the present lack of
suitable tools able to overcome technical diﬃculties inherent to the algebraic structure of
the κ-Minkowski algebra. Nevertheless, families of scalar ﬁeld theories on the noncommu-
λ, a kind of deformation of R3 introduced a long ago in [19] (see also [20]),
tative space R3
have been considered recently in [21] and shown to be free of perturbative UV/IR mixing.
Among these, some NCFT were even shown to be ﬁnite to all orders in perturbation.

θ and to R4

At the classical level, the construction of gauge invariant actions is not so diﬃcult, once
a diﬀerential calculus has been set up, together with a proper notion of noncommutative
connection [22], [23].The situation becomes complicated as far as perturbative behavior is

1In the following, only NCFT on what could be called informally ”totally noncommutative geometries”
will be considered, leaving aside the recent developments in gauge models of Connes-Chamseddine-types
built on ”almost commutative geometries”. See e.g [2], [3]

θ but not for R2

concerned, since gauge invariance requirement supplements the inherent diﬃculties in the
renormalisation of NCFT. Investigations to extend the features of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar
model to a gauge theoretical framework started in the middle of 2000’s and produced a
lot of articles. This ﬁnally gave rise to a gauge invariant model on R4
θ obtained either by
eﬀective action computation or by heat kernel methods [24]. This model appears to be
linked to a particular type of spectral triple [25] whose relationship to the Moyal noncom-
mutative metric geometries [26] has been analyzed in [27]. Unfortunately, its complicated
vacuum structure explored in [28] forbids the use of any standard perturbative treatment
for R4
θ, at least for a particular vacuum conﬁguration. This can be achieved
by representing the gauge invariant model as a matrix model [29], showing a relationship
with an extension of a 6-vertex model and exhibiting a vacuum instability against quan-
tum ﬂuctuations, as shown in [29]. Alternative approaches based on the implementation
of a IR damping mechanism that may render harmless the UV/IR mixing have been also
proposed [30]-[33]. This damping approach is appealing. However, interpreting the action
within the framework of some noncommutative diﬀerential geometry is unclear if possible
at all at the present, unlike the case of the induced gauge action. So far, the construc-
tion of a renormalizable gauge theory on R4
θ is unsolved. Another approach provided by
the matrix model formulation of noncommutative gauge theories has also evolved partly
independently, initiated a long ago in [34] in the context of type IIB (stringy) matrix mod-
els. This basically amounts to re-interpret the noncommutative gauge theories as matrix
models taking advantage of the relationship between the gauge potential in its noncommu-
tative version and the covariant coordinates (see Section 2 below). Related works focused
on (semi-)classical properties and/or 1-loop computations. For exhaustive reviews on the
huge recent literature on this area, see [35] (see also e.g [36]-[38] and references therein).

Gauge theories on R3

λ algebra. In [40], a family of gauge theories on R3

λ have been investigated very recently by exploiting the canon-
ical matrix basis introduced in [21] which combined with suitable families of orthogonal
polynomials (namely dual Hahn polynomials) and the Favard theorem [39], a corollary of
the spectral theorem, leads to a tractable computation of the relevant propagator. These
investigations on gauge theories were partly motivated by the absence of UV/IR mixing
and the occurrence of a natural UV cut-oﬀ in families of NCFT studied in [21], stemming
from the very structure of the R3
λ , which
may be viewed as describing the ﬂuctuations of the gauge potential around the classical
vacuum Aµ = 0, was shown to exhibit the mild perturbative UV behavior expected from
[21]. However, the classical vacuum for this family is unstable against quantum ﬂuc-
tuations as shown in [40].
It turns out that some of these gauge theory models, when
truncated to a single ”fuzzy sphere” M2j+1(C), can be related to a particular version of
the Alekseev-Recknagel-Schomerus action [41], which pertains to the area of string theory
and describes a low energy action for brane dynamics on S3. In [42], a family of gauge
theories on R3
λ in a diﬀerent background corresponding to the so called gauge-invariant
connection has been considered and shown to be UV ﬁnite to all orders in perturbation
and without any IR singularity.

This family of perturbatively ﬁnite gauge theories indexed by 3 positive parameters will
be the subject of the present paper. In Section 2, all the noncommutative data ﬁxing the
structure of the classical action are given and discussed, outlining the essential ingredients
and possible ways of extensions. A particular emphasis is put on the presentation of the
algebra R3
λ that does not resort on star products and related machinery of deformation
theory. The gauge-invariant connection occurring in the speciﬁc diﬀerential calculus chosen
here is discussed. In Section 3, the main properties of the family of gauge-ﬁxed actions are

3

outlined and discussed. The partition function factorizes into an inﬁnite product of factors,
each of these factors, says Zn, corresponding to the partition function of the gauge theory
truncated to Mn(C), n ∈ N. Fixing one parameter to a speciﬁc value modiﬁes the quartic
interaction term. Then, each Zn is shown to be expressible as a ratio of determinants so
that the corresponding truncated gauge theory is solvable. A relation to integrable 2-D
Toda lattice hierarchy and some reduction is indicated. Section 4 summarizes the results.

For the ensuing analysis, the algebra R3

λ and group algebras.

λ can be conveniently presented as

λ = (

M2j+1(C), .)

(2.1)

where M2j+1(C) is the algebra of (2j + 1)x(2j + 1) complex matrices and the symbol ”.”
denotes the usual operator (”matrix”) product which will not be explicitly written in the
following. R3
λ is obviously unital with involution deﬁned by the (hermitean) conjugation.
Recall that M2j+1(C) is referred in the physics literature as the algebra of fuzzy sphere
of radius j. Hence, R3
λ can be viewed informally as an inﬁnite sum of fuzzy spheres. A
more precise (albeit less intuitive) characterization of this noncommutative space may be
obtained from considerations of harmonic analysis on SU (2).

Indeed, from (2.1), it can be readily observed that the inﬁnite direct sum decompo-
sition coincides with the Peter-Weyl decomposition of L2(SU (2)) which therefore shares
its linear structure with R3
λ. Recall that for any compact (topological) group G, one can
write L2(G) = ⊕χ∈ ˆGEχ where ˆG is the countable set of equivalence classes of irreducible
representations of G and Eχ is the vector space of coeﬃcients of the representation χ, i.e
the vector space generated by (cid:104)χ(g)u, v(cid:105), u, v being vectors of the representation space
of χ. Moreover, the vector space Eχ, endowed with the convolution product on G is an
algebra, isomorphic to Mn(C) with n = dim(χ). In the G = SU (2) case, one has the de-
M2j+1(C). The SU (2) Fourier transform deﬁnes a map

for any function f ∈ L2(SU (2)) where dµ(x) is the Haar probability measure for SU (2).
Here, tj(x) is the so called matrix of the coeﬃcients of the representation for x ∈ SU (2)
whose elements are given (in obvious notations) by (tj(x))mn = (cid:104)jm|χj(x)|jn(cid:105) where
{|jm(cid:105)}−j≤m≤j is the orthonormal family spanning the carrier space of the representation
indexed by j ∈ N

2 , which is nothing but a Wigner D-matrix. The inverse map is

where trj is the canonical trace on M2j+1(C) for any j ∈ N

In this framework, R3
λ may be naturally interpreted as the (Fourier transform of the)
convolution algebra of SU (2),
i.e the Fourier transform as given by relation (2.2) of
(L2(SU (2)),•) where • is the associative convolution product on SU (2) given for any

functions f, g ∈ L1(SU (2)) by f • g(u) =(cid:82)

SU (2) dµ(t)f (ut−1)g(t). Other interesting larger
group algebras can be obtained from the convolution algebra, namely the von Neumann
algebra A(SU (2)), i.e the multiplier algebra of C∗(SU (2)) which is the C∗-algebra of the
group SU (2). They will not be needed here.

In order to make connection with the physics literature, one can notice that this
structure singles out natural ”coordinates” given by the (hermitean) generators xµ, µ =
1, 2, 3 of the Lie algebra su(2) which can be expressed conveniently within a suitable basis

2.2 Noncommutative diﬀerential geometry set-up.

At the classical level, the construction of noncommutative gauge models can be done
once a noncommutative diﬀerential calculus has been chosen. A particular version of the
derivation-based diﬀerential calculus, a natural noncommutative extension of the usual
de Rham complex, will be considered in the sequel. This has been introduced a long
ago in [22], inspired partly from the Koszul algebraic formulation of standard diﬀeren-
tial geometry [43]. For mathematical developments and applications to noncommutative
ﬁeld theories see [44] and references therein. Informally, the key of this noncommutative
diﬀerential calculus is to interpret the derivations of the algebra as the noncommutative
analogs of the vector ﬁelds. Notice that the derivation based diﬀerential calculus does
not exploit the natural Hopf algebra structure present on R3
λ. A possible choice would
be to start from the bicovariant diﬀerential calculus [45], which will not be considered here.

Let G be the Lie algebra of real inner derivations of R3

λ deﬁned as in [40] by

Diﬀerent notions of noncommutative connection have been introduced. Here, the no-
tion of (hermitean) connection on a right-module over the algebra will be used [22] which
is the one mostly used in the physics literature on the noncommutative ﬁeld theories. It
can be viewed informally as a noncommutative extension of the notion of connection on
a module introduced by Koszul [43] in the framework of standard diﬀerential geometry.
Note that it would be interesting to carry out an analysis similar to the one presented
below starting with the notion of connection over a bimodule [23] which should be more
suited for a bicovariant diﬀerential calculus [45].

Let M be a hermitean (right-)module over the algebra with hermitean structure2 de-

noted by h. A hermitean connection on M can be deﬁned as a linear map :

∇ : M → M ⊗ Ω1G

∇(ma) = ∇(m)a + m ⊗ da,
dh(m, n) = h(∇(m), n) + h(m,∇(n))

(2.21)
for any m, n ∈ M and any a in the algebra. The group of gauge transformations Aut(M, h)
deﬁned as the group of the automorphisms of M preserving h, i.e h(φ(m), φ(n)) = h(m, n),
acts on the real aﬃne space of hermitean connections as
φ (cid:46) ∇ := ∇φ = φ−1 ◦ ∇ ◦ φ,

(2.22)
for any φ ∈ Aut(M, h). The curvature can then be deﬁned as the morphism of module
given by

∇2 : M → M ⊗ Ω2G..

hermitean connection is characterized by the 1-form A := ∇(I) ∈ Ω1G with related 2-form

2A hermitean structure is deﬁned as a sesquililear form h : M×M → A (here A = R3

G. iX
and LX act as derivations respectively with −1 and 0 degree. By noticing that one can
write d = −[Θ, ] on Ω0G, reﬂecting the fact that the derivations in G are inner, and making
use of standard properties of graded commutators, one infers

LX Θ = iX dΘ + d(iX Θ) = iX (dΘ + ΘΘ) = iX F inv = 0,

(2.31)

owing to (2.28) which therefore indicates that Θ is an invariant form in the language of Car-
tan operations but not horizontal (since one has iX Θ (cid:54)= 0). Recall that Cartan operations
appears as building ingredients in the formulation of invariant and basic cohomologies,
which are essential to deal with topological ﬁeld theories (of cohomological types) [47] as
well as in algebraic formulation of BRST symmetry and related s-cohomology modulo d
in connection with the algebraic classiﬁcation of (chiral) anomalies [48].
The invariant 1-form Θ deﬁnes actually the form-connection for the canonical gauge-
invariant connection that occurs in the present set-up. From (2.21), it can be readily
realized (∇inv(I) = Θ) that this latter is given by

∇inv(a) := da + Θa = aΘ,∀a ∈ R3
λ.

(2.32)

Gauge invariance follows immediately from (2.22). The corresponding curvature is given
by (2.28) computed just above. Hence Θ deﬁnes a ﬂat connection.
A natural gauge covariant tensor 1-form is then deﬁned from

3 Exact formulas in noncommutative gauge models on R3
λ.

3.1 Noncommutative gauge (matrix) models.
From the above, it follows that any functional of the form Tr(P (A)) where P is a polyno-
mial will give rise to a gauge invariant object. This simpliﬁes the construction of candidates
for classical gauge theory models and permits one to express/represent such a gauge theory
model as a ”matrix model” deﬁned by a functional action S(A) with A as ﬁeld variable.
For technical reasons, the study of such a matrix model representation is sometimes easier
than its partner with Aµ as ﬁeld variables. This observation has been widely exploited e.g
in the context of theories on Moyal spaces R4
θ leading to interesting semi-classical inves-
tigations [34]-[38]. Whenever S(A) supports A0 = 0 as some vacuum conﬁguration, one
may interpret S(A) either as a model describing the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations of Aµ
around 0 or alternatively, in view of (2.33), (2.35), as a model describing the ﬂuctuations
of Aµ, the ”gauge potential”, around the ”gauge-invariant connection”.
As far as gauge theory models on R3
λ as well as on Moyal spaces are concerned, it appears
that a wide class of models has vacuum instabilities whenever the vacuum does not corre-
spond to this gauge-invariant potential (see e.g [29], [40]). At the present time, I do not
have any explanation (if any) of this behavior.

We close this subsection by noticing that the gauge invariant object ΘµΘµ veriﬁes

ΘµΘµ ∈ Z(R3
λ)

9

(3.1)

which can be easily veriﬁed by using (2.27) together with (2.17) and (2.15), (2.16) and
recalling that Z(R3
λ) is generated by x0. From this, it follows that for any polynomial
P (A), one has

Tr(P (A)ΘµΘµ)g = Tr(P (A)ΘµΘµ)

i.e, it is gauge invariant, which can be realized by using gauge invariance of Θµ together
with (2.34), (3.1) and cyclicity of the trace.
We set from now on

(3.2)

(3.3)

Aµ = iΦµ.

From (3.2) and in view of (2.17), one concludes that gauge invariant harmonic terms

∼ Tr(x2ΦµΦµ)

(3.4)

are allowed in any gauge-invariant classical action on R3
λ. Note that harmonic terms per-
tain to the liturgy of noncommutative ﬁeld theories. Such a term has been initially used
as an essential ingredient in the construction of a all order perturbatively renormalisable
scalar ﬁeld theory with quartic interaction on the Moyal space R4
θ [10]. Its eﬀect is, roughly
speaking, to increase suﬃciently the decay behavior of the propagator so that it can ac-
tually neutralize the so called UV/IR mixing that occurs on R4
θ.
As far as gauge theories are concerned, a harmonic term ∼ Tr(x2ΦµΦµ) would break gauge
invariance in the R4
θ case because the counter part of (3.1) does not hold true, namely
ΘµΘµ /∈ Z(R4

θ) (Θ being here the gauge-invariant connection for R4

θ, see e.g [44]).

Looking for positive gauge invariant actions (at most quartic in the ﬁeld Φµ) that
support Φµ = 0 as classical vacuum conﬁguration, the analysis in [42] gave rise to the
following family of classical actions

g2 Tr(cid:0)[Φµ, Φν]2 + Ω{Φµ, Φν}2 + (M + µx2)ΦµΦµ(cid:1),

1

Scl =

with

Ω ≥ 0, µ > 0, M > 0

(3.5)

(3.6)

where we set x2 = xµxµ with mass dimensions [Ω] = 0, [µ] = 4, [M ] = 2, [g2] = 1 so that
the action is dimensionless, assuming that the relevant dimension here is the ”engineering
λ equal to 3. In (3.5), {a, b} := ab + ba. Notice that the action (3.5) is
dimension” of R3
similar to the action for a matrix model.

As shown in [42], the gauge-ﬁxing can be conveniently performed in the gauge Φ3 = θ3
while gauge-invariance of (3.5) is traded for invariance under a BRST symmetry [46] whose
structure equations deﬁning the nilpotent Slavnov operation s are [42]

sΦα = i[C, Φα], sC = iCC
s ¯C = b, sb = 0

(3.7)

(3.8)

where C is the ghost ﬁeld with ghost number +1 and ¯C and b are respectively the antighost
and the St¨uckelberg ﬁeld (with respective ghost number −1 and 0). The Slavnov operation
s acts as an antiderivation with respect to the grading given by (the sum of) the ghost
number (and degree of forms), modulo 2.
Then, adding to (3.5) the s-exact gauge-ﬁxing action

Sφπ = s Tr(cid:0) ¯C(Φ3 − θ3)(cid:1) = Tr(cid:0)b(Φ3 − θ3) − i ¯C[C, Φ3](cid:1),

(3.9)

10

and integrating over the Stueckelberg ﬁeld b which enforces the gauge condition Φ3 = θ3,
it can be realized that the ghost part decouples. Finally, deﬁning the complex ﬁelds

Φ :=

(Φ1 + iΦ2), Φ† :=

(Φ1 − iΦ2),

(3.10)

one obtains the following gauge-ﬁxed action

where the kinetic operator Q is an element of L(H), the space of linear operators acting
on the Hilbert space

H = span{vj

}

(3.12)

and is given by

Q = MI + µL(x2) + 8ΩL(θ2

3) + i4(Ω − 1)L(θ3)D3

(3.13)
in which L(.) denotes the left multiplication. Q is self-adjoint as it can be seen by noticing
that the ﬁrst 3 terms in (3.13) are expressible as a sum a orthogonal projectors while
self-adjointness of the last term stems from the self-adjointness of L(θ3) and D3 together
with [D3, L(θ3)] = 0.
It is convenient to rewrite any j-component of the kinetic term as

(3.16)
with ﬁnite degeneracy for each of the eigenvalues which decays to 0 as j → ∞. Hence,
the resolvent operator of Q, RQ(z) = (Q − zI)−1, for any z /∈ spec(Q) is compact:
RG(z) ∈ K(H). Finally, the spectrum (3.16) is positive which implies that Q is a positive
self-adjoint operator.

The main result of [42] holds true for the action (3.11). Namely, one has the following

property:

Theorem 3.1 ([42]) The amplitudes of the ribbon diagrams of any arbitrary order for
the functional action (3.11) for M > 0, µ > 0, Ω > 0 are ﬁnite.

The somewhat lengthy proof given in [42] can be achieved thanks in particular to a power
counting for the ribbon diagrams stemming from the perturbative expansion. At this
point, some comments are in order. First, the UV (and IR) ﬁniteness of the gauge theory
model (3.11) actually stems from the combination of:
i) the existence of an upper bound for the propagator Q−1 which by the way corresponds
to the propagator of another all order ﬁnite gauge invariant model that I will not discuss

11

2 which acts as a natural (UV) cut-oﬀ,

here (see [42]),
ii) the salient role played by j ∈ N
iii) a suﬃcient rapid decay of the propagator at large j (corresponding to the UV region)
insured by the presence of the gauge-invariant harmonic term discussed above.
Note that the action (3.11), which can be viewed as describing the ﬂuctuations of the
covariant coordinates around the vacuum Φ0 = 0 can be alternatively interpreted as
describing the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations of the gauge potential Aµ around the ”gauge-
µ = −θµ, since the covariant coordinates are deﬁned as the
invariant connection”, says A0
diﬀerence of 2 connections, as discussed above.
Next, it can be realized that the origin of property ii) given above stems from the Peter-
Weyl decomposition of the algebra. Hence, I expect that a similar feature (namely the
occurrence of natural UV cut-oﬀs) should hold true in generalization of the present con-
struction of other compact group (e.g SU (n)).

3.2 Partition functions as ratios of determinants.

I assume from now on Ω = 1
quartic interaction term depends only on ΦΦ†. The action (3.11) reduces to

3 . Accordingly, the last interaction term vanishes so that the

Sf

where the positive self-adjoint operator Q is

(3.17)

(3.18)

One observes that the action formally shares some common points with the action describ-
ing an exactly solvable model investigated in [14]. It turns out that the partition function
for Sf

1/3 (3.11) can be related to τ -functions of integrable hierarchies.
Indeed, thanks to the Peter-Weyl decomposition of R3
λ (2.1), the partition function
can be expressed as a product of factors labeled by j ∈ N
2 , each one related to a ratio of
determinants. Note that each of these factors can be interpreted as the partition function
for the reduction of the gauge-ﬁxed theory (3.11) on the matrix algebra M2j+1(C), i.e a
fuzzy sphere of radius j. A standard computation using Q (3.18) gives rise to the following
expression for the partition function

Zj(Q) for any j ∈ N
2 can be interpreted as the partition function for the gauge model trun-
cated to a ”fuzzy sphere” M2j+1(C). It turns out that the functional integration in (3.20)
can be entirely performed. As a result, Zj(Q) is expressible as a ratio of determinants, up
to an unessential prefactor, as I now show.

Deﬁne a change of integration variable by making use of a singular value decomposition

of Φj. Namely, one has

(3.24)
where U and V are unitary matrices in M2j+1(C) and Rj ∈ M2j+1(C) is a diagonal positive
matrix. Set

Rj := diag(ρj

(3.29)

From (3.29), one observes that one can decouple the ﬁeld variables U and V (the ”angular”
part) from the positive diagonal (”radial”) part, thanks to the expression for the quartic
potential at Ω = 1
Indeed, the integration over U and V can be performed by using the Harish-Chandra/Itzykson-
Zuber measure formula of the random matrix theory. Recall that for any hermitean ma-
trices M, N ∈ Mn(C) with eigenvalues of M ordered as λM
n (and similar
ordering for N ) and any unitary matrix U ∈ Mn(C), the following formula holds true:

2 ≤ ... ≤ λM

for any j ∈ N
2 . Hence, all the functional integrals in Zj(Q) can be explicitly carried out so
that any corresponding truncated gauge model on M2j+1(C) can be viewed as an exactly
solvable model.

The ratio of determinants appearing in the RHS of (3.40) is somehow reminiscent of
a τ -function such as those occurring in integrable hierarchies. In fact, (3.40) could have
been expected owing to the similarity between the present gauge model (3.17) and the LSZ
model [14]. Recall that this latter belongs to a particular class of scalar ﬁeld theories with
quartic interaction built on the Moyal space R4
θ. It has been shown to be exactly solvable,
by exploiting a correspondence with the large N limit of a complex 1-matrix model.
In the present situation however, one cannot take advantage of some large N (i.e large
j) limit to draw general conclusion on Zj(Q) at arbitrary j (except for the case j → ∞)
j Zj(Q) (3.19). Recall that the other family of gauge models on R3
investigated perturbatively in [40], when truncated to a single ”fuzzy sphere” M2j+1(C),
is related to the Alekseev-Recknagel-Schomerus action [41] which pertains to the area of
string theory and describes the low energy action for brane dynamics on S3. It would be
interesting to examine if some relation similar to (3.40) shows up within some of these
latter gauge model for some particular choice of parameters.

and so on Z(Q) =(cid:81)

λ

A relation between any truncated gauge model on M2j+1(C) and integrable 2-D Toda
lattice hierarchy can be conveniently exhibited by introducing in the partition function
Zj(Q) a source term linearly coupled to the trace of the operator Φ†Φ (which may be
viewed as a kind of analog of the condensate operator) i.e supplementing the argument
g2 trj(ΣjΦ†jΦj) where Σj ∈ M2j+1(C) is the hermitean
of the exponential in (3.20) by − w(j)
source of the ”composite operator” (see (A.2) of the appendix A). Then, the corresponding
partition function Zj(Q; Σ) can be expressed as

Setting Σj = 0 in (3.41) leads to the related expression for Zj(Q) which thus corresponds
to a reduction of this hierarchy.

4 Discussion and conclusion.

R3
λ as deﬁned by (2.1) supports a family of (matrix) gauge theory models described by
(3.11) with stable vacuum which are perturbatively ﬁnite to all orders. The ”mass term”
ΘµΘµ for the gauge-invariant connection Θµ belongs to the center of the algebra insuring
that gauge-invariant harmonic terms can be included in the functional action, thus imply-
ing that the gauge propagator decays as an inverse power of the natural UV cut-oﬀ j. The
fact that j, the radius of the fuzzy sphere M2j+1(C), plays the role of a UV cut-oﬀ comes
from the Peter-Weyl decomposition of R3
λ which enforces a factorization of the partition
Zj(Q) (3.19), (3.20) where Zj(Q) can be viewed as the partition

function as Z(Q) =(cid:81)

j∈ N

function for the gauge theory truncated on the fuzzy sphere M2j+1(C). For a particular
value of one parameter, namely Ω = 1
3 , the quartic interaction term simpliﬁes leading to
(3.17) and each Zj(Q) can be exactly expressed as a ratio of determinants indicating that
the corresponding truncated gauge theory is formally exactly solvable. A relation with
(reduction of) integrable 2-D Toda lattice hierarchy is also given. Hence, the gauge the-
ory described by (3.17) is related to an inﬁnite tower of solvable gauge theories on fuzzy
spheres. A full characterization of the gauge theory (3.17) would need to carry out the
j ln(Zj(Q)), which is not easy to achieve. This task has been

resummation of W (Q) =(cid:80)

undertaken.
The understanding of the quantum properties of NCFT and their gauge theoretic ver-
sions is still in its prime infancy, despite many advances achieved since the beginning of
this century, obtained from the analysis of several representative prototypes mentioned
or analyzed in this paper. These advances are mainly technical in nature, ranging from
diagrammatic computational tools to adapted rules for ”power counting”. In their present
formulation, (most of) these non local theories are rooted in an Euclidean set-up, stemming
from the underlying noncommutative structures. A proper inclusion of some noncommuta-
tive analog of causality is needed in order to widen their possible relevance to physics and
to understand what in NCFT supercede (at least) the concepts (and their interplays) of
locality, microcausality and power counting ruling ordinary quantum ﬁeld theories. These
3 notions were often present in numerous endless discussions I had with Raymond Stora
so many years ago.
