COMPLETELY DECOMPOSABLE JACOBIAN VARIETIES IN

NEW GENERA

JENNIFER PAULHUS AND ANITA M. ROJAS

Abstract. We present a new technique to study Jacobian variety decom-
positions using subgroups of the automorphism group of the curve and the
corresponding intermediate covers. In particular, this new method allows us
to produce many new examples of genera for which there is a curve with com-
pletely decomposable Jacobian. These examples greatly extend the list given
by Ekedahl and Serre of genera containing such curves, and provide more ev-
idence for a positive answer to two questions they asked. Additionally, we
produce new examples of families of curves, all of which have completely de-
composable Jacobian varieties. These families relate to questions about special
subvarieties in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties.

1. Introduction

A principally polarized abelian variety over C is called completely decomposable if

it is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. Ekedahl and Serre [Ekedahl and Serre 93]
ask the following two questions.

Question 1. Is it true that, for all whole numbers g, there exists a curve of genus
g whose Jacobian is completely decomposable?

Question 2. Are the genera of curves with completely decomposable Jacobians
bounded?

They demonstrate various curves up to genus 1297 with completely decomposable
Jacobian varieties. However, there are numerous genera in that range for which they
do not produce an example of a curve with this property.

Since their paper, there has been much interest in curves with completely decom-
posable Jacobian varieties, particularly the applications of such curves to number
theory. Dimension two has been widely studied; for example, in [Earle 06] a full
classiﬁcation of Riemann matrices of strictly completely decomposable Jacobian va-
rieties of dimension 2 is given (these are Jacobians which are isomorphic to a prod-
uct of elliptic curves). In [Kani 94], the case of completely decomposable abelian
surfaces is studied, and several other authors have also studied these questions. See
[Carocca et al. 14], [Magaard et al. 09], [Nakajima 07], and [Yamauchi 07], among
many others.

Additionally, in [Moonen and Oort 11, Question 6.6] the authors ask about pos-
itive dimensional special subvarieties, Z, of the closure of the Jacobian locus in the
moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties such that the abelian variety

corresponding with the geometric generic point of Z is isogenous to a product of el-
liptic curves. In Section 3.3, we discuss examples of positive dimensional families of
curves with completely decomposable Jacobians, and connections to this question.
Despite advancements in the ﬁeld, the questions of [Ekedahl and Serre 93] still
remain open. Since the publication of Ekedahl and Serre’s list of genera 20 years
ago, there have been few new examples of genera with a compact Riemann surface
of that genus with a completely decomposable Jacobian.
In [Yamauchi 07], the
author gives a list of integer numbers N such that the Jacobian variety J0(N ) of
the modular curve X0(N ) has elliptic curves as Q−simple factors. These exam-
ples include three genera not previously noted in [Ekedahl and Serre 93] for which
there is a completely decomposable Jacobian variety: these are genus 113, 161, and
205 (corresponding to N = 672, 1152, and 1200, respectively). His techniques are
number theoretic and relate to [Ekedahl and Serre 93, Section 2].

In this paper, we use experimental tools to ﬁnd many examples of completely de-
composable Jacobian varieties in new genera. We do this by using a new approach
involving known results on intermediate coverings, i.e., quotients by the action of
subgroups of the full group acting on the variety.

We summarize the main results of this work in the following theorem. The bold

numbers indicate genera which are new in this paper.

Theorem. For every g ∈ {1–29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34–36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51–52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 61, 62–64, 65, 67, 69, 71–72,
73, 79–81, 82, 85, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 103, 105–107, 109, 118, 121, 125, 129,
142, 145, 154, 161, 163, 193, 199, 211, 213, 217, 244, 257, 325, 433} there is
a curve of genus g with completely decomposable Jacobian variety which may be
found using a group acting on a curve. Moreover in some cases there is a family of
such curves of dimension greater than 0.

Even for the already known genera, our examples are all derived from group ac-
tions, whereas many of the examples found in [Ekedahl and Serre 93] use the theory
of modular curves. Genus 3 to 10, except genus 8 are in [Paulhus 08]. Genus 8 may
be found with a curve of automorphism group of size 336 where the Jacobian is
isogenous to E 8 for some elliptic curve E.

The pervious theorem, and the approach we outline in Section 2.2, open up the
possibility that Question 1 might have a positive answer, and that group actions
might be the tool to solve it. As we will see, once there is a completely decompos-
able Jacobian variety of a certain genus, by considering subgroups, it is possible to
produce new examples in lower genus. Moreover, this theorem also suggests that
perhaps there is no bound for the genus of curves with completely decomposable
Jacobian variety, it might be a matter of simply ﬁnding the right group action.

We describe the techniques used to decompose Jacobians in sections 2.1 and
2.2. In Section 3 we give explicit examples in both new and old genera. Our new
examples may be found in Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2. Those genera exhibiting
a family of curves of dimension greater than 0 with completely decomposable Ja-
cobians are given in Theorem 3.3. The computations needed to ﬁnd both the old

COMPLETELY DECOMPOSABLE JACOBIAN VARIETIES IN NEW GENERA

3

and new examples were made using Magma [Bosma et al. 97]. Finally, we address
computational limitations of our techniques in Section 4. The many examples from
the paper may be useful to researchers interested in open questions surrounding
groups acting on curves with completely decomposable Jacobians.

2. Techniques

Consider a compact Riemann surface X (referred to from now on as a “curve”)
of genus g with a ﬁnite group G acting on that curve. We write the quotient curve
X/G as XG and the genus of the quotient as g0. Let the cover X → XG be ramiﬁed
at r places, q1, . . . , qr. The signature of the cover is an (r+1)-tuple [g0; s1, s2, . . . , sr]
where the si are the ramiﬁcation indices of the covering at the branch points. We
denote the Jacobian variety of X by JX.

2.1. The group algebra decomposition. For many examples, we use the group
action of the automorphism group G of X to decompose JX. We brieﬂy describe
the technique here for a general abelian variety A. More details may be found in
the original article [Lange and Recillas 04] or [Birkenhake and Lange 04, Chp. 13].
Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g with a faithful action of a ﬁnite group

G. There is an induced homomorphism of Q-algebras

ρ : Q[G] → EndQ(A).

Any element α ∈ Q[G] deﬁnes an abelian subvariety
Aα := Im(mρ(α)) ⊂ A

where m is some positive integer such that mρ(α) ∈ End(A). This deﬁnition does
not depend on the chosen integer m.

Begin with the decomposition of Q[G] as a product of simple Q-algebras Qi

Q[G] = Q1 × · · · × Qr.

The factors Qi correspond canonically to the rational irreducible representations
Wi of the group G, because each one is generated by a unit element ei ∈ Qi which
may be considered as a central idempotent of Q[G].

The corresponding decomposition of 1 ∈ Q[G],

1 = e1 + · · · + er

induces an isogeny, via ρ above,

(1)

Ae1 × · · · × Aer → A

which is given by addition. Note that the components Aei are G-stable complex
subtori of A with HomG(Aei , Aej ) = 0 for i 6= j. The decomposition (1) is called
the isotypical decomposition of the complex G-abelian variety A.

The isotypical components Aei can be decomposed further, using the decompo-
sition of Qi into a product of minimal left ideals. If Wi is the irreducible rational
representation of G corresponding to ei for every i = 1, . . . , r, and χi is the character
of one of the irreducible C-representations associated to Wi, then set

4

ni =

deg χi

mi

where mi denotes the Schur index of χi. There is a set of primitive idempotents
{πi1, · · · , πini } in Qi ⊂ Q[G] such that

ei = πi1 + · · · + πini .

Moreover, the abelian subvarieties Aπij are mutually isogenous for ﬁxed i and j =
1, . . . , ni. Call any one of these isogenous factors Bi. Then (see [Carocca and Rodr´ıguez 06])

Bni

i → Aei

is an isogeny for every i = 1, . . . , r. Replacing the factors in (1) we get an isogeny
called the group algebra decomposition of the G-abelian variety A

(2)

Bn1

1 × · · · × Bnr

r → A.

Note that, whereas (1) is uniquely determined, (2) is not.

It depends on the
choice of the πij as well as the choice of the Bi. However, the dimension of the
factors will remain ﬁxed.

Remark 2.1. While the factors in (2) are not necessarily easy to determine, we
may compute their dimension in the case of a Jacobian variety JX with the action
of a group G induced by the action on the corresponding Riemann surface X (see
[Paulhus 08] for details). Deﬁne V to be the representation of G on H1(X, Z) ⊗Z Q.
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, here we assume the quotient XG has
genus g0 and the cover π : X → XG has r branch points {q1 . . . , qr} where each qi
has corresponding monodromy gi. The tuple (g1, . . . , gr) is called the generating
vector for the action [Broughton 90].

Then the character χV associated to V is

(3)

χV = 2χtriv + 2 (g0 − 1) ρh1Gi +

r

X

i=1

(cid:0)ρh1Gi − ρhgii(cid:1)

[Broughton 90, Equation 2.14], where χtriv is the trivial character on G, ρH is the
induced character on G of the trivial character of the subgroup H (when H = hgii,
this subgroup is the stabilizer, or isotropy group, of a point in the ﬁber of the
branch point qi), and ρh1Gi is the character of the regular representation. Then

(4)

dim Bi =

dimQ πi,j V =

2

hψi, χV i

where here ψi is the character of the Q-irreducible representation of G corresponding
to Bi, and χV is the character deﬁned in (3).

One way we ﬁnd completely decomposable Jacobian varieties is to search for
curves so that the decomposition in (2) gives factors Bi of dimension only 0 or 1,
computed via (4).

2.2. Intermediate Covering Decomposition. While the technique in the pre-
vious section gives us a number of examples of completely decomposable Jacobians
in new genera (see Theorem 3.1), we can extended the technique by studying de-
compositions of intermediate coverings of a higher genus curve with a known de-
composition of its corresponding Jacobian variety. This idea expands the range of
genera with completely decomposable Jacobians which can be found using group
actions. We ﬁnd many more new genera, as listed in Theorem 3.2.

To describe the technique, we begin with the following proposition.

Proposition 2.2. [Carocca and Rodr´ıguez 06, Proposition 5.2] Given a Galois
cover X → XG, consider the group algebra decomposition (2)

is the

By Frobenius Reciprocity, we know that

dim Vj

H = hVj , ρH i

where hVj, ρH i is the inner product of the characters of these representations. Sup-
pose X is a curve with a known Jacobian decomposition as in (2), not necessarily
completely decomposable. Then apply the previous proposition to get a decom-
position of JXH as in (5) where JXH will be completely decomposable precisely
when hVj , ρHi = 0 for all j such that dim Bj > 1 for the Bi in the decomposition
of JX. We have thus proven:

Proposition 2.3. Given the conditions in the previous proposition, assume that
hVj, ρH i = 0 for all j such that dim Bj > 1, and hVj , ρH i 6= 0 for at least one
index j with dim Bj = 1. Then the Jacobian variety of the curve XH is completely
decomposable.

Notice that even though a Jacobian variety JX may not be completely decom-
posable, a Jacobian JXH of some intermediate cover XH = X/H could decompose
completely. This gives us a much richer set of curves to search through to ﬁnd com-
pletely decomposable Jacobian varieties. There are numerous examples of curves
in high genus whose Jacobians decompose into many elliptic curves, but may not
be themselves completely decomposable. By applying Proposition 2.3, quotients of
these curves may then be completely decomposable.

Let us demonstrate with a couple of examples. More details and several other
examples may be found in Section 3.2. First, a note on our notation for the rest
of the paper. In most instances, we will write a speciﬁc group as an ordered pair,
where the ﬁrst number is the order of the group and the second number is its num-
ber in the Magma or GAP database of groups of small order. Also, for consistency
in labeling subgroups and conjugacy classes, we convert all groups to permutation
groups ﬁrst. For the Jacobian decompositions, when we write En × Em we are

from (2) and Em corresponds to

j

Example 1. A complete search of genus 12 curves as listed in [Breuer 00] using
techniques from Section 2.1 gives no example of a genus 12 curve with a completely
decomposable Jacobian. However, we may ﬁnd one as the quotient of a higher
genus curve which has a completely decomposable Jacobian. There is a curve X of
genus 29 with the action of G = (672, 1254). From Section 2.1, the Jacobian of X
decomposes completely as

JX ∼ E 6 × E 7 × E 8 × E 8,

each factor corresponding to a diﬀerent complex (and rational) irreducible repre-
sentation. The group G has several non-normal subgroup H of order 2, and one is
such that the dimensions of the ﬁxed spaces for the corresponding representations
from the decomposition are all 3. Therefore the Jacobian of the intermediate curve
XH (a genus 12 curve) decomposes as the same four elliptic curves each one to the
power of 3. That is,

J(XH ) ∼ E 3 × E 3 × E 3 × E 3.

Note that Ekedahl and Serre also ﬁnd a genus 12 example as a quotient of the
modular curve X0(198) of genus 29 by an involution. However, the group in our
example is too large to be the automorphism group of this modular curve.

Example 2. Using this technique on one of our new examples from Section 2.1,
we can generate another example. Consider G = (720, 767) acting on a curve X of
genus 61 with signature [0; 2, 6, 6]. It has a subgroup H of order 2 such that XH has
genus 30 and a completely decomposable Jacobian. Note that a genus 30 example
is not one found by Ekedahl and Serre.

Example 3. Finally consider an example of a higher genus curve which is not
completely decomposable, but an intermediate cover produces a lower genus curve
which is completely decomposable. There is a genus 101 curve with automorphism
group G = (800, 980) whose Jacobian decomposes as

JX ∼ E × A2 × E 2 × E 8 × · · · × E 8
}

{z

12

where A2 is an abelian variety of dimension 2. This group has three subgroups
which produce quotients of genus 51. One of those three subgroups produces a
decomposition as in (2) where the factor above of dimension 2 has dimension 0,
and thus we get the following complete decomposition:

JXH ∼ E × E 2 × E 4 × · · · × E 4

3. Results

In this section we apply the techniques from Sections 2.1 and 2.2 to ﬁnd com-
pletely decomposable Jacobian varieties (including all the genera found by Ekedahl
and Serre [Ekedahl and Serre 93] and Yamauchi [Yamauchi 07] except for g = 113,
205, 649, and 1297).

COMPLETELY DECOMPOSABLE JACOBIAN VARIETIES IN NEW GENERA

Our primary task is to ﬁnd examples where the dimensions in (2) or (5) above are
all 0 or 1. To construct our examples, we must know the automorphism group and
signature of curves in high genus. We use three data sources for this information.
Breuer [Breuer 00] provides complete lists of automorphism groups and signatures
for curves of a given genus up to genus 48. We use his data up through genus
20. For genus 21–101, we use data computed by Conder [Conder 10], giving all
automorphism group of size greater than 4(g − 1) for a given genus g (this size
condition guarantees, in particular, that g0 is 0).

Finally, for genus greater than 101, we use the ideas described in [Conder 14] to
ﬁnd possible automorphism groups corresponding to a few targeted signatures (par-
ticularly those signatures which gave us lower genus examples as in Theorem 3.1).
Given a signature [0; s1, . . . , sr], we use the Magma command LowIndexNormalSubgroup(K,n)
to ﬁnd all possible low index normal subgroups of the group

K = hx1, . . . , xr|xs1

1 = · · · = xsr

r = x1 · · · xr = 1i.

These normal subgroups give us possible automorphism groups for that signature
up to a particular genus which depends on the choice of n (see [Farkas and Kra 92,
page 260] ). We will see that these large genus curves give us many new examples.

Notice that the computation of χV in (3) requires knowledge of a generating
vector of the action. Modiﬁcations to [Breuer 00] give us a way to compute gen-
erating vectors if the automorphism group and signature are already known. See
[Paulhus 15] for details.

For each of these three data sets and a ﬁxed group G and signature, we ﬁrst
compute the Jacobian decomposition as in (2) and, if this is completely decompos-
able, we record it. Next we compute all orders of subgroups of G and if any of those
orders produce a quotient of still unknown genus, we apply the technique of Section
2.2 to see if this subgroup produces a completely decomposable intermediate cover.
Note that, from (5), if we take a completely decomposable Jacobian of higher genus,
the Jacobian variety corresponding to any intermediate quotient by any subgroup
will automatically be completely decomposable.

In our computations, as we increased the genus, we removed from consideration
all lower genera we had already found an example for. So our examples for Section
2.2 are just a sample of such curves for a given genus and may not represent all
curves of that genus which have decomposable Jacobians realizable through group
actions. We chose as our goal demonstrating the usefulness of our technique, and
not performing an exhaustive search of all decomposable Jacobians for any known
genus.

We divide the results into three sections: those found through the technique in
§2.1, those found through the technique in §2.2, and those which give a family of
dimension greater than 0 of completely decomposable Jacobians of a given genus.

3.1. Group algebra decomposition examples. The new genera, those not in-
cluded in Ekedahl and Serre’s paper, found using the technique in Section 2.1 are
given here.

Theorem 3.1. Let g ∈ {36, 46, 81, 85, 91, 193, 244}. There is a completely decom-
posable Jacobian variety of dimension g. Moreover, each one corresponds to the
Jacobian variety of a curve of genus g with the action of a group G as listed in

8

J. PAULHUS AND A. M. ROJAS

Table 1. The signature for the action and the decomposition are also listed in the
table.

Proof. The proof consists of following the program outlined in Section 2.1. For this
we need to ﬁnd appropriate group actions on the missing genera.

In genus 36 there are two curves, up to topological equivalence with automor-
phism group PGL(2, 7) and signature [0; 2, 6, 8]. It is possible to classify actions
topologically by using the action of the Braid group on a generating vector for the
action. We do not describe these details here, but references are [Broughton 90],
[Harvey 71] and [V¨olklein 96]. A review of the principal results on this matter and
a program in Sage [Stein et al.] which computes the non-equivalent actions, can be
found in [Mu˜noz 14], [Behn et al. 15]. Both curves have a decomposition of the
form

JX ∼ E 6 × E 7 × E 7 × E 8 × E 8.

The irreducible C-characters of this group are all irreducible Q-characters, except
for two of degree 6. The decomposition then follows from (2) and (4). The factors
in the Jacobian decomposition come from an irreducible C-character of degree 6,
and the two irreducible Q-characters in each of degrees 7 and 8.

In genus 46 there is one curve, up to topological equivalence, with automorphism

group (324, 69) and signature [0; 2, 6, 18]. This curve has a decomposition

JX ∼ E × E × E 2 × E 6 × E 6 × E 6 × E 6 × E 6 × E 6 × E 6.

In this case, the factors in this decomposition come from two separate sets of two
degree 1 irreducible C-characters whose sums are irreducible Q-characters, one set of
two degree 2 irreducible C-characters whose sum is also an irreducible Q-character,
and six of the irreducible C-characters of degree 6 which are all irreducible Q-
characters.

In genus 81 a curve X with automorphism group (1152, 157853) and signature

[0; 2, 4, 9] has Jacobian decomposition

JX ∼ E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9 × E 9.

For genus 85 there is a curve X with automorphism group of size 2016 given as

and with signature [0; 2, 4, 6] which has Jacobian decomposition
E 6 × E 7 × E 8 × E 8 × E 12 × E 14 × E 14 × E 16.

In the genus 81 case, the factors in this decomposition come from nine separate
degree 9 irreducible C-characters which are all irreducible Q-characters.
In the
genus 85 case, the factors in the decomposition come from irreducible C-characters
one each of degree 6, 7, 12, and 16, and two each of degree 8 and 14. All of these
characters are irreducible Q-characters.

For genus 91 there is a one dimensional family of curves with automorphism
group G = (432, 686) and signature [0; 2, 2, 2, 12]. All curves in this family are com-
pletely decomposable. Using data from [Conder 10] for genus 91, there is no larger
automorphism group which has curves with completely decomposable Jacobians.
In particular, no curve in this family has a larger automorphism group.

Finally, for genus 193 there is an curve with automorphism group of size 5706
and signature [0; 2, 3, 10] while in genus 244, the size of the group is 11, 664 and
the signature is [0; 2, 3, 8]. Both examples were found using the Magma command

In Table 1 we record one example of a curve with completely decomposable Ja-
cobian for each genus found with the technique from section 2.1. For completeness,
we include the genera found by Ekedal and Serre, or Yamauchi. For each genus,
we chose an example with the largest automorphism group. In the table we include
the automorphism group as well as the signature. When possible, we denote the
groups as ordered pairs where the ﬁrst term is the order of the group, and the
second term is the group identity number from Magma’s database. If the order of
the group exceeds the allowable sizes for these databases, we have labeled the group
as a number (sometimes with a subscript). The number represents the order of the
group. If the subscript itself is a number, then the group presentation may be found
in data of Conder [Conder 10] where the subscript denotes which of groups of that
order (and with the corresponding signature) in his data it is. If the subscript is
a letter (or if there is no subscript at all), the presentation of the group may be
found at [Paulhus and Rojas 16].

The ﬁnal column of the table represents the decomposition as a list of numbers
represent the ni from (2). Again, we note that it is conceivable that distinct elliptic
curve factors in (2) may be isogenous. The new examples from this technique are
denoted by a *.

All of our examples come from group actions, while some of Ekedahl and Serre
examples (and the newer work of Yamauchi [Yamauchi 07]) use modular curves.
We checked that in the genera where examples were obtained with modular curves
in [Ekedahl and Serre 93], our corresponding example was not a modular curve. To
determine this, we compared the size of the automorphism group of modular curves
of the relevant level, which can be determined by using [Kenku and Momose 88,
Theorem 0.1] and [Akbas and Singerman 90, Proposition 2], with the size of the
automorphism groups of our examples. Only in g = 73 did the sizes match, and in
that case we explicitly computed the automorphism group of X0(576) to determine
that it is not the same as our example in Table 1. Notice that our genus 26 example
is the well known example of the curve X(11).

Many more examples were found than appear in the paper. We provide tables
of all examples we found, not just those of the largest automorphism group order,
at [Paulhus and Rojas 16]. For genus up to 20, this is a complete list using this
technique for all curves with g0 = 0. For genus 21 –101, this is a complete list for
all curves with automorphism group larger than 4(g − 1). For genus beyond 101 we
only give the curves found by strategic searching, and there may be other examples
for a given genus.

3.2. Intermediate cover examples. Using the technique from Section 2.2, we
obtain the following new examples. Notice that we found many more new genera
with this new technique.

COMPLETELY DECOMPOSABLE JACOBIAN VARIETIES IN NEW GENERA

11

Theorem 3.2. Let g ∈ {30, 32, 34, 35, 39, 42, 44, 48, 51, 52, 54, 58, 62–64, 67,
69, 71, 72, 79, 80, 89, 93, 95, 103, 105–107, 118, 125, 142, 154, 199, 211, 213}.
There is a completely decomposable Jacobian variety of dimension g. Moreover,
each one corresponds to the Jacobian variety of a curve obtained as a quotient by
H ≤ G of a curve of higher genus with the action of a group G.

Proof. We give an outline of the proof for one case, the rest follow similarly. Also
recall that in Section 2.2 we gave examples of several other cases.

Consider the group G = (1152, 5806) acting on a curve X of genus 73. Then JX

decomposes into 10 factors (each one a power of an elliptic curve),

JX ∼ E × E 2 × E 2 × E 4 × E 8 × E 8 × E 8 × E 8 × E 16 × E 16.

Using the technique described in Section 2.2, there is a non-normal subgroup H
of G of order 2 such that XH has genus 35 and has a completely decomposable
Jacobian. The decomposition of the Jacobian variety of the genus 35 curve is as
follows, where Ei corresponds to the ith term in the decomposition of JX above

J(XH ) ∼ E2 × E 2

4 × E 4

5 × E 4

6 × E 4

7 × E 4

8 × E 8

9 × E 8

10.

(cid:3)

In Table 2 we give one example for each genus where we found an example only
through intermediate covers. We use the same convention for labeling groups as
in Table 1. Again, complete lists of data we found are at [Paulhus and Rojas 16].
In this table we also include the genus of the intermediate cover, the genus and
automorphism group and signature for the larger curve, the subgroup size and
number for the corresponding subgroup H (labeled as Magma does, and recall our
convention of converting all groups to permutation groups), and the decomposition
of the quotient curve. For ease of notation, we grouped all factors from (2) of the
same dimension together, although they may not be in that order, nor correspond
to the order of the decomposition of the high genus curve. For instance, if the
decomposition were given as E 2 × E 4 × E 2, we would denote this as 2, 2, 4.

There are some genera (up to 500) on Ekedahl and Serre’s list for which the
technique in Section 2.1 cannot identify a curve with completely decomposable
Jacobian, and which do not appear in Table 1. The set of such genera is {12, 18,
20, 23, 27, 40, 45, 47, 53, 217}. All these examples may be generated using our
second technique of intermediate covers from Proposition 2.3. We also collect this
data in Table 2. Again, our new examples are denoted with a ∗.

COMPLETELY DECOMPOSABLE JACOBIAN VARIETIES IN NEW GENERA

13

3.3. Examples of Families. Recall from the proof of Theorem 3.1 that the only
completely decomposable Jacobian varieties of dimension 91 discovered using the
group algebra technique were a one dimensional family of curves (so using the group
algebra technique only, there is no curve with an automorphism group correspond-
ing to a dimension 0 family in genus 91 having a completely decomposable Jaco-
bian). There are several known examples of families of completely decomposable
Jacobians in low genus (see [Frediani et al. 15], [Lange and Rojas 12, Section 4],
[Paulhus 07]), and, as we mentioned in the introduction, in [Moonen and Oort 11]
the authors asked for examples of special subvarieties such that the generic point
is completely decomposable. Therefore our techniques provide a way of ﬁnding
examples of families where one can look for examples to answer their question.

Here we highlight the genera where we ﬁnd a one dimensional (or higher) family
of completely decomposable Jacobians of that genus. We elaborate on the question
in [Moonen and Oort 11] after the theorem.

Theorem 3.3. Let g ∈ {11–19, 21–29, 31, 33–35, 37, 40, 41, 43–47, 49, 52, 53,
55, 57, 61, 65, 57, 69, 73, 82, 91, 93, 95, 97, 109, 129, 145, 193}. Then there is
a dimension one (or larger) family of completely decomposable Jacobians of curves
of genus g which can be found using the techniques from Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

Proof. Again, we only demonstrate with a couple of examples. The rest follow in
the same way via data listed in Table 3 for those genera found through the technique
in Section 2.1, and Table 4 for those found through the technique in Section 2.2. In
these tables, for each genus we only give an example of the largest automorphism
group we found which leads to a completely decomposable Jacobian (and the highest
dimensional family, if that is not the same). Again, for genus greater than 20, we
only searched groups of order greater than 4(g − 1), so there may be other examples
of higher dimensional families with completely decomposable Jacobians. All other
examples we found appear in the data at [Paulhus and Rojas 16]. For completeness,
we have added all examples for genus 3 through 10 curves in the Appendix, only
including those corresponding to the action of the full automorphism group. This
data includes many previously know examples.

There is a family of curves of genus 73 with the action of the group (432, 682)
with signature [0; 2, 2, 2, 6], see the data at [Paulhus and Rojas 16]. Since this curve
is completely decomposable, all quotients by corresponding subgroups H will also
be completely decomposable. In particular, this group has a subgroup of order 2
which gives a new example for genus 34.

There are several diﬀerent group actions on curves of genus 49 giving one di-
mensional families of completely decomposable Jacobians. For instance, the group
(256, 3066) acts with signature [0; 2, 2, 2, 8] and has a subgroup of order 2 which
forms a quotient of genus 23, and the group (288, 627) acting with signature [0; 2, 2, 2, 6]
has a subgroup of order 4 which forms a quotient of genus 12.

(cid:3)

Using notation from earlier in the paper, let G be a ﬁnite group acting on genus
g with signature m = [0; s1, . . . , sr], and generating vector θ = (g1, . . . , gr). For a
ﬁxed pair (m, θ), by moving the branch points of the covering in P1 one obtains
an (r − 3)-dimensional family of such coverings, and a corresponding family of
Jacobians J (G, m, θ) of the same dimension. For references see [Frediani et al. 15]
or [V¨olklein 96]. The symplectic group Sp(2g, Z) acts on the Siegel upper half
space, Hg, and Ag = Sp(2g, Z) \ Hg is a complex analytic space which parametrizes

principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g. It corresponds to the analytic
point of view of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties over C
of dimension g.

Denote by Z(G, m, θ) the closure of J (G, m, θ) in Ag. The action of G on X,
hence on its Jacobian JX, induces a symplectic representation ρ : G → Sp(2g, Z)
of G. Let HG
g be the set of ﬁxed points of G in Hg (see [Behn et al. 13] for details).
In [Frediani et al. 15, Thms. 1.4, 3.9, Lemma 3.8] there is a nice characterization of
when Z(G, m, θ) is a special subvariety. Their criterion is as follows, if the dimension
of HG
g equals the dimension of J (G, m, θ), which is r−3, then Z(G, m, θ) is a special
subvariety of Ag that it is contained in the closure Tg of the Torelli (or Jacobian)
locus, and which intersects non-trivially the Torelli locus T 0
g .

Given a pair (m, θ) for a ﬁxed G, using [Behn et al. 13] one can ﬁnd the dimen-
sion of HG
g , although it is computationally expensive. Additionally, code is provided
in [Frediani et al. 15] which can compute the dimension for low genus examples as
well.

Our Table 3 contains examples of families found using group actions, so we
can apply the criterion of [Frediani et al. 15] to determine if they correspond to
special subvarieties. We remark that this criterion is a suﬃcient one, therefore
these families could correspond to special subvarieties even if they do not satisfy
the criterion. Moreover, in Table 4, we give examples of families of completely
decomposable Jacobian varieties arising from intermediate coverings, therefore the
criterion of [Frediani et al. 15] cannot be directly applied. It is a work in progress
to adjust the criterion to this situation.

We show with one example how the families on Table 3 may correspond to
special subvarieties. Let G be the alternating group A4, acting on genus 4 with
signature m = [0; 2, 3, 3, 3]. We have then a one dimensional family J of Jacobians.
Using [Behn et al. 13] we determine that the dimension of HG
4 is also 1. Therefore,
according to [Frediani et al. 15], the closure Z of J is a special subvariety of A4
contained in T4 and such that Z ∩ T 0

4 6= ∅.

Using the group algebra decomposition (see the Appendix), we conclude that
the elements in J (hence in HG
1 . Therefore it is an example
answering [Moonen and Oort 11, Question 6.6]. Notice that E corresponds to an
irreducible representation ϕ of G such that G/ ker(ϕ) ∼= Z/3Z, hence E has the
action of the cyclic group of order 3 and thus it is ﬁxed along the family. This
family is one of the special subvarieties found in [Frediani et al. 15, Table 2].

decompose further. There may be examples using a ﬁner decomposition which ﬁll
other gaps in Ekedahl and Serre’s list.

Computationally, ﬁnding automorphism groups and signatures in high genus is

resource heavy. The memory requirements for the Magma command LowIndexNormalSubgroups
limit our ability to use this command to ﬁnd other examples in even higher genus,
or to ﬁll remaining gaps using the intermediate cover technique. We are optimistic
that, given suﬃcient computational resources, the techniques we describe above
could produce numerous additional new examples.

5. Appendix

Here we provide all examples of families of curves, for genus 3–10, which have
completely decomposable Jacobians. These were found by searching all Breuer’s
data for these genera, and then removing those groups that were not the full au-
tomorphism group for the given family. Some of the examples in this table were
known before [Frediani et al. 15].
