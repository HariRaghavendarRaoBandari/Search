Abstract

We analyze the low temperature structure of a supersymmetric quiver quantum
mechanics with randomized superpotential coeﬃcients, treating them as quenched
disorder. These theories describe features of the low energy dynamics of wrapped
branes, which in large number backreact into extremal black holes. We show that
the low temperature theory, in the limit of a large number of bifundamentals, ex-
hibits a time reparametrization symmetry as well as a speciﬁc heat linear in the
temperature. Both these features resemble the behavior of black hole horizons in
the zero temperature limit. We demonstrate similarities between the low tempera-
ture physics of the random quiver model and a theory of large N free fermions with
random masses.

In this work we consider how certain techniques developed in the study of systems with

quenched disorder may be used in the context of string theory. The rough picture goes as

follows: consider wrapping branes on complicated cycles within some compact manifold

such that the branes are point-like in the non-compact space. These internal cycles can

intersect amongst each other and amongst themselves, giving rise to a large number of

light degrees of freedom localized at the brane intersections. Moreover, the diﬀerent

intersection modes can further interact with each other via some stringy processes. If

the charges of the point-like branes in the non-compact directions, which are given

by the cohomology of the cycles they wrap, become large enough we expect them to

backreact into a charged extremal black hole. We expect several of the features of

such black holes to be governed by the eﬀective quantum mechanical theory obtained

upon reducing the wrapped cycles to the lowest Kaluza-Klein modes. Generically this

will be governed by some rather complicated Hamiltonian, coupling the large number

1

of intersection modes between each other. The parameters of this Hamiltonian will

result from diﬃcult calculations involving the detailed structure of the compactiﬁcation

manifold. But perhaps, to some good approximation, they can simply be treated as a

collection of random variables. If, in addition, these random variables evolve on time

scales much larger than that of the intersection modes themselves, they may be viewed as

quenched disorder. Our interest is to analyze the eﬀect of this type of quenched disorder

in a particular quantum mechanical model motivated from string theory. This approach

is similar in spirit to Wigner’s [1], who analyzed the spectral properties of heavy nuclei

by approximating their Hamiltonian by a random matrix.

The model we consider is a supersymmetric quantum mechanics with four super-

charges [2, 3]. The matter content is organized in a quiver diagram, with bifundamental

ﬁelds connecting diﬀerent nodes and adjoint ﬁelds residing on the nodes. These models

have been argued to describe, at weak coupling, the low energy physics of branes wrap-

ping diﬀerent cycles in a Calabi-Yau compactiﬁcation. The adjoint matter describes

the degrees of freedom of the brane’s motion in the non-compact directions, and the

bifundamentals capture the intersection modes in the internal cycles. Interestingly, cer-

tain types of quivers exhibit an exponentially large number of ground states [9] (in the

large intersection number limit) reminiscent of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the

extremal black holes they are supposed to describe at strong coupling. The Hamilto-

nian of these models is highly constrained by supersymmetry, but it does allow for a

superpotential which leads to interactions between the diﬀerent intersection modes. The

coeﬃcients of this superpotential are in principle ﬁxed by an often prohibitively diﬃcult

calculation depending on many of the details of the compactiﬁcation manifold and its

internal cycles. It is these superpotential coeﬃcients that we take to be random in this

paper, as a ﬁrst step toward our broader goal.

The extremal black holes that the branes backreact into have several features of
interest such as an AdS2 × S2 near horizon with an SL(2, R) symmetry and the possible
It was
fragmentation of this throat into a multitude of split horizons [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

previously shown that the quiver models on the Coulomb branch, i.e. when the branes

are separated in the non-compact space, are described in the low energy limit by an
SL(2, R) invariant multi-particle mechanics [10]. This is reminiscent of the SL(2, R)
invariant mechanics [11, 12] deﬁned by the motion of the tips in the fragmented extremal

throat.

We focus instead on the Higgs branch of the model, where the branes are sitting on

top of each other and the intersection modes are light. In order to analyze this branch, we

invoke the replica trick which involves considering n replicas of the original system. Upon

2

integrating out the random disorder, these replicas interact amongst each other. At large
intersection number N , the system is described by a collection of n × n replica matrices
QAB. The ‘paramagnetic’ case QAB = Q δAB is shown to be perturbatively stable.
Moreover, as speculated in [10], we ﬁnd that the disorder averaged theory exhibits an
emergent time reparametrization symmetry at low temperatures, containing an SL(2, R)
subgroup. This is reminiscent of the symmetry found in the near horizon region of

extremal black holes [13]. This is very similar to the situation encountered in several

models of quenched quantum systems, such as the system recently considered in [14,

15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Additionally, we study the low temperature thermodynamics of the

system. We show that the speciﬁc heat at low temperatures grows linearly. Interestingly,

the speciﬁc heat of near extremal black holes has a similar linear growth in T .

In

appendix A we discuss how a simple model of free fermions with random masses also

exhibits several of these features.

Finally, we establish that the Coulomb branch and Higgs branch SL(2, R) invariant
sectors are distinct—the scaling dimensions of the ﬁelds in each sector is diﬀerent. We

also initiate the study of more general replica symmetric and replica symmetry breaking

saddles, but leave a complete analysis of this question to future work.

2 Quiver quantum mechanics

The quantum mechanical theories of interest in this paper have four supercharges [3].
The matter content resides in a chiral multiplet Φi

scalar φi
α. The index
α = 1, 2, . . . , N indicates a particular intersection mode connecting two branes, and the

index i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , m represents the particular pair of branes being connected. We

consider a cyclic quiver with three nodes (and hence three branes), i.e. m = 3, since

it is the simplest case and the general m-node cyclic case turns out to be qualitatively

similar. The Euclidean action contains a standard kinetic piece:

(2.7)

It is useful to provide the engineering dimensions of the various ﬁelds. With [τ ] = +1
we have [ω(cid:126)α] = −3/2, [φα] = +1/2, [ψα] = 0 and [Fα] = −1/2. For the system at ﬁnite
temperature T = 1/β we identify τ ∼ τ + β with [β] = +1.

As mentioned in the introduction, these theories can be viewed as low energy eﬀective

actions arising from the dynamics of open strings living at the intersection points of

branes wrapped along internal cycles in the compactiﬁcation manifold. The branes are

point like in the non-compact dimensions, and we are discarding their position degrees

of freedom (which comprise a vector multiplet) by making them parametrically massive.

A more complete analysis would include these degrees of freedom. We brieﬂy discuss

their eﬀect in section 5. For large values of N the point-like branes can backreact into
extremal black holes with an AdS2×S2 throat in the near horizon geometry. The details
of the coeﬃcients ω(cid:126)α are contained in the geometry of the compactiﬁcation manifold and

4

the speciﬁc cycles wrapped by the branes.

It is in general rather complicated to compute the exact values of ω(cid:126)α. Therein lies
the basic assumption of our paper. We take the ω(cid:126)α to be random coeﬃcients drawn
independently from a Gaussian probability distribution with variance (cid:104)|ω(cid:126)α|2(cid:105) = Ω2 and
vanishing mean. Moreover we assume that the disorder is quenched, such that we must

average over the disorder only upon computing a particular extensive, physical quantity

such as the free energy. In what follows we analyze the implications of such quenched

disorder.

2.1 Partition function and the replica trick

In order to compute the two-point function we consider the Euclidean partition function
at ﬁnite temperature:2

(cid:90)

DΦI e−SE [ΦI ; ω(cid:126)α] ,

Zω[T ] =

(2.8)
where I is a generalized index specifying any of the given ﬁelds. The bosonic degrees
of freedom are periodic around the thermal circle τ ∼ τ + 1 and the fermonic degrees
of freedom are anti-periodic. For a given realization of disorder the above partition

function is too complicated to analyze. However for large enough systems, disorder-

averaged quantities get at the essential physics. Since the disorder is quenched, the
main quantity of interest is the averaged free energy, given by the logarithm of Zω[T ].
We express this as (with overlines denoting disorder averages):

Fω[T ] = −T log Zω[T ] = −T lim
n→0

∂n(Zω[T ])n .

(2.9)

At this point take n to be an integer, such that we can view (Zω[T ])n as n-replicas
of the original system. The average over the quenched disorder is performed over this

replicated system, and the basic assumption is that the ﬁnal results can be analytically

continued to real n. This assumption is known in the literature as the replica trick, and

is a basic tool in analyzing simple models of spin glasses. As a warm up example in

using the replica trick, we provide a simple solvable case of free fermions with a random

mass matrix in appendix A.

Upon integrating out the disorder we ﬁnd an eﬀective action for the replicated degrees

Notice that upon integrating out the disorder we have coupled the replica indices.

Also note that since the original action is bounded from below, the path integral over
the replica matrices must be well deﬁned for all Ω2 > 0. Furthermore, (2.10) is invariant
under the same supersymmetry transformations as the original action. This is to be

expected, since the theory is supersymmetric for any given realization of the variables
ω(cid:126)α.

2.2 Replica matrices
At this point we introduce replica matrices: QIJ
ing the on-shell conditions:

where we use the generalized index I = {i, type} to specify the node index i and the
ﬁeld type, i.e. φ, F or ψa. We use the integral representation of the delta functionals
by introducing Lagrange multipliers ΛIJ

AB(τ, τ(cid:48)):

.

(2.14)

Upon implementing the delta function conditions, the remaining Seﬀ is quadratic in
the ΦI
αA, which we can consequently integrate out. This leads to a Berezinian de-
terminant factor and an interacting action in the bilocal ﬁelds. Writing (2.12) as

6

Skin =(cid:82) dτ dτ(cid:48) ¯ΦI

αA(τ )OIJ (τ, τ(cid:48))ΦJ

αA(τ(cid:48)), the determinant factor reads:

Det(cid:2)OIJ (τ, τ(cid:48)) ⊗ In×n + iΛIJ

AB(τ, τ(cid:48))(cid:3)−N

.

(2.15)

If we had chosen to turn on a source JI
would also be a function of these JI
to an additional term in the eﬀective action:

Aα(τ ) for the ΦI

Aα(τ ). In this case integrating out the ΦI

Aα(τ ) ﬁelds, the partition function
Aα(τ ) leads

Aα(τ )(cid:2)OIJ ⊗ In×n + i ΛIJ

AB(τ, τ(cid:48))(cid:3)−1

Bα(τ(cid:48)) .

Ssource[JI

A(τ )] = −

dτ dτ(cid:48) ¯JI

The above expression expresses the correlation functions of the original ﬁelds Φ in terms

of the new variables Q and Λ.

2.3 Large N limit

Notice that the functional determinant in (2.15) is raised to the power N . We are
interested in a particular large N limit, which we will now specify. We rescale Q → N Q
and keep ΩN ≡ λ, Q and Λ ﬁxed as N → ∞. With this large N limit all exponents in
the eﬀective action scale as N .

It follows from (2.15) and (2.16) that the saddle point value of the QIJ

AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) com-

putes the various disorder averaged, equilibrium, two-point functions:

(cid:104) ¯ΦI

αA(τ )ΦJ

αB(τ(cid:48))(cid:105) .

QIJ
AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) =

1
N
It is useful to note that several of theses QIJ
AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) will vanish. (For example, they might
involve a single fermionic ﬁeld.) Moreover, there will always be a large N saddle point for
AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) all have I = J . This saddle will be perturbatively
which the replica matrices QIJ
stable against ﬂuctuations in the I (cid:54)= J directions. We study such saddles in what
follows, since they already contain a lot of interesting phenomena.

In the I = J subspace, the eﬀective action simpliﬁes considerably. Thus we can

(2.17)

simplify our notation slightly. We denote:

AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) ≡ 1

the replica matrices: Qi
AA(τ(cid:48) − τ ) is a real odd function of u ≡ (τ − τ(cid:48)). In what

3 Replica symmetry

The action (2.21) is symmetric among the replica indices A, B. However, as is the case

in spin glass models, replica symmetry can be spontaneously broken. In this section we

discuss whether or not replica symmetry is broken in the model described above. To

understand this question, one must understand the dominant contribution to the parti-

tion function at large N . In several simple models of quantum systems with quenched

disorder [20, 21], when replica symmetry is broken it indicates a transition to a glassy

phase. A way to determine the presence of replica symmetry breaking is to study ﬂuc-

tuations about a replica symmetric saddle of the free energy and to see whether it is

locally stable.

8

3.1 Small ﬂuctuations about the paramagnetic ansatz
It follows from an argument in [20] that when A (cid:54)= B, the replica matrices must be time
independent. The argument uses the fact that diﬀerent replicas are decoupled before the

disorder is integrated out. Hence the two-point function of two ﬁelds carrying diﬀerent

replica indices must factorize into a product of their respective one-point functions.

(cid:1) with qi

AB(τ, τ(cid:48)) =(cid:0)δABQi(τ, τ(cid:48)) + qi

However, the equilibrium value of the one-point function for a ﬁxed realization of disorder
AB with A (cid:54)= B is itself τ -independent,
is τ -independent. From this it follows that Qi
i.e. Qi
AB = ¯qi
BA independent of τ and vanishing
for A = B. For Si,a
AB = 0 for
αA(cid:105) vanishes identically.
A (cid:54)= B since the equilibrium one-point function of a fermion (cid:104)ψi,a
The simplest and most symmetric ansatz sets the qi
AB = 0, and we refer to this as the
‘paramagnetic’ ansatz.

AB(τ, τ(cid:48)), we have the even stronger condition that Si,a

AB

We would like to understand if this ansatz is a stable solution of the saddle point
equations stemming from the large-N action. The linear ﬂuctuation of Seﬀ must van-
ish at the saddle point and thus the question is whether all quadratic contributions
locally increase the value of the action. Expressing the ﬂuctuations as qi
AB =
δABQi(τ−τ(cid:48))+qi
AB and expanding the eﬀective action to second order in the ﬂuctuations
we ﬁnd:

In the above expression (Qi)−1 is deﬁned such that

(3.2)

Notice that the quadratic ﬂuctuation is positive deﬁnite. Thus, at least locally, the

paramagnetic ansatz remains stable for all values of the temperature. This does not bar

the possibility of a lower free energy conﬁguration, only that such a conﬁguration will

be reached by non-perturbative ﬂuctuations away from the paramagnetic one.

3.2 Paramagnetic equations of motion

Having argued that the paramagnetic ansatz is locally stable, we can examine the saddle
point equations governing the diagonal elements of the replica matrix QAB at large N .
Taking the replica matrices to be diagonal, we are left with the following eﬀective action:

When λ = 0, it is easy to see that Si,a and Qi are precisely the frequency space two-point
functions of a free fermion and a free boson respectively, and as expected.

We can study perturbative corrections to the free result in a small λ-expansion. These

are given in appendix B to ﬁrst order. We ﬁnd to leading order in λ that the permutation
symmetry acting on the node index remains unbroken. Also, Si,a(k) = (2πik)Qi(k) (at
large k) holds to sub-leading order in small λ indicating that supersymmetry is preserved

to this order. At large λ the solutions may change signiﬁcantly. We analyze this limit in

the next section. Before doing so, we make some brief remarks about replica symmetry

breaking.

3.3 Replica symmetry breaking?

Though the paramagnetic ansatz is perturbatively stable, we can still ask whether replica

symmetry breaking takes place in this model. Though we do not analyze this question

extensively in this work, we will make some brief comments in this section. First we

need to study the simplest replica symmetric, yet non-paramagnetic, ansatz:

QAB(k) = Q(k) δAB + υ AB δk,0 ,

(3.9)

where AB ≡ (1− δAB) is the matrix with vanishing diagonal terms and one’s otherwise.
We have dropped node and spinor indices, by assuming that in addition all the Qi
AB are
equal amongst each other. The υ is a real constant independent of the frequency known

as the Edwards-Anderson parameter in the spin glass literature [22]. A non-vanishing

Edwards-Anderson parameter often indicates the presence of glassy behavior.

With this ansatz, the eﬀective action additionally becomes a function of υ. The part

that depends on the new variable υ is, for general replica size n:

= −(n − 1) log [Q(0) − υ] − log [(n − 1)υ + Q(0)] +

(n − 1) log(cid:2)λ2(cid:0)Q · Q − υ2(cid:1) + 1(cid:3) + log(cid:2)λ2(cid:0)(n − 1)υ2 + Q · Q(cid:1) + 1(cid:3) ,

(3.10)

Sef f [υ]

3N

where we deﬁne Q · Q ≡(cid:80)

m Q(m)Q(−m). The equation of motion for υ in the n → 0

limit is given by:

υ

[Q(0) − υ]2 =

2λ4υ3

[1 + λ2(Q · Q − υ2)]2 .

(3.11)

11

Clearly the paramagnetic values υ = 0 is always a solution. To obtain the other solutions

we must take into account the eﬀect of non-vanishing υ on the equations governing

Q(k) and S(k). This is a hard task, but inspection of (3.11) already reveals that real

solutions for υ are present given some Q(k). Assuming that there exists a solution with

non-vanishing υ, we can study ﬂuctuations about this more general replica symmetric
background. To do so, we consider quadratic perturbations δQAB away from the replica
symmetric background with a replica symmetry breaking perturbation. In perturbing
away from the replica symmetric conﬁguration we require δQAA = 0 and we also impose
that tr ( · δQ) = tr ( · δQ ·  · δQ) = 0. To obtain the quadratic action governing the
perturbations, we must use the inverse of the replica symmetric matrices (3.9) [21]:

(cid:18)

[Q(k) − υ δk,0]

δAB −

υ δk,0

[Q(k) + (n − 1)υ δk,0]

(3.12)

Also useful is the inverse:

(cid:2)IAB + λ2(cid:0)Q · Q IAB + υ2 AB

(cid:1)(cid:3)−1
(cid:2)λ2(cid:0)Q · Q + (n − 2)υ2(cid:1) + 1(cid:3) δAB − υ2λ2AB

=

{λ2(υ2 − Q · Q) − 1}{λ2[(1 − n)υ2 − Q · Q] − 1} .

The perturbations are dictated by the following action:

with (in the limit n → 0):

AQ =

(3.15)
Using the equation of motion (3.11), we note that the expression for AQ simpliﬁes. The
eigenvalue of the mass matrix of δQAB is given by:

(cid:34)

λ2(cid:0)Q · Q − 2υ2(cid:1) + 1

(λ2(υ2 − Q · Q) − 1)2

(cid:35)2

λQ = − 3
2

(2υλ)2

≤ 0 .

(3.16)

That λQ is negative indicates that there is no stable replica symmetric saddle υ (cid:54)= 0. It
is always favorable to push in the direction of replica symmetry breaking!

What about these replica symmetry breaking saddles [22]? For instance, we could

12

consider a single step replica symmetry breaking ansatz. This is given by splitting the
n replicas into n/m clusters of size m. Within each m × m cluster the matrix takes
the value q0. For the pieces of the replica matrix not inside a given cluster, the replica
matrix takes the value υ < q1. As before the diagonal components of the replica matrix
take the value Q(k). In other words:

QAB(k) = [Q(k) − q1δk,0] δAB + [q1 − υ] (m)

(3.17)
AB is equal to one whenever A and B are within a diagonal m × m
where the matrix (m)
block. We leave it to future work to see whether such an ansatz, as well as the more

AB δk,0 + υ δk,0 ,

general k-step replica symmetry broken matrices, lead to further stable large N saddles.

4 Scaling regime

In this section we consider the theory in the large λ limit. This can also be viewed as
a low temperature limit, since upon reinstating the temperature λ2 → λ2β3. Consider
the saddle point equations (3.4) and (3.5). If it is the case that the terms proportional
to λ2 on the right hand side are dominant, then the theory exhibits a large symmetry:

τ → f (τ ) ,

(cid:18) df (τ )
(cid:18) df (τ )

dτ

Qi(τ, τ(cid:48)) →

Si,a(τ, τ(cid:48)) →

Qi(cid:0)f (τ ), f (τ(cid:48))(cid:1) ,
Si,a(cid:0)f (τ ), f (τ(cid:48))(cid:1) ,

df (τ(cid:48))
dτ(cid:48)
df (τ(cid:48))
dτ(cid:48)

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

dτ

Moreover, it follows from (3.4) and (3.5) that the scaling coeﬃcients must obey the

following relation:

µSi1,1 + µSi2,2 + µQi3 + 2 = 0 ,

(cid:126)i ∈ S3 .

(4.4)

If the subgroup of the permutation symmetry permuting the µQi and µSi remains un-
broken, then µQi = µQ and µSi1,a = µS such that:

2µS + µQ + 2 = 0 .

(4.5)

We shall see in what follows that the above is indeed the saddle point solution
at low temperatures, for given values of µQ and µS. The above symmetry is a time
reparametrization invariance, or in other words it is the set of diﬀeomorphisms (known

as the Witt algebra) that map the circle to itself. This vast symmetry group has a

13

maximal ﬁnite dimensional sub-algebra generating the group SL(2, R) of real 2 × 2
matrices with unit determinant. Thus, the theory has an emergent conformal invariance

in the particular scaling limit we have considered. We emphasize that for this symmetry

to be precise, one requires a large N and strong coupling limit.

4.1 Solutions

We wish to ﬁnd solutions to (3.7) and (3.8) at strong coupling/low temperature. In order

to make the low temperature limit more transparent, we will temporarily reintroduce
factors of β and take the β → ∞ limit. To reintroduce units of β we recall the discussion
on units from Section 2; that is the dimensionless combinations are Q(k)/β, S(k), and
λ2β3. In the β → ∞ limit, the thermal frequencies ωk = 2πk/β become continuous and
the sums over momenta can be replaced by integrals. Furthermore, since we have de-

compactiﬁed the thermal circle, there is no shift by one-half in the fermionic frequencies.
We study the case where all Qi’s and Si,a’s are taken to be equal and drop the node and
spinor SO(3) indices entirely. This gives

Notice that the equations are self consistent. This can be seen by integrating both
equations over ωk and substituting (4.10) into (4.9).

4.1.1 Non-supersymmetric solution

Let us assume that the solution to the saddle point equations (4.9) and (4.10) takes the

form:

αQ|β ωk|a ,

Q(k) = β

(4.11)
These correspond to conformal weights ∆Q = (1−a)/2 for the scalars and ∆S = (1−b)/2
for the fermions.3 Due to (4.5), we have a = 1− 2b. Plugging (4.11) into (4.9) and (4.10)
leads to divergences if we are not careful. One may consider regulating them by analytic

Without loss of generality, we will take ωk > 0 in (4.9) and (4.10). Let us treat (4.10)
ﬁrst for simplicity. First deﬁne ωm ≡ ˜mωk and C ≡ αQα2
˜λ2/π, then we can write (4.10)
as

(4.15)

Let us now treat (4.9) and label the ﬁrst and second terms A and B respectively:

(cid:90)

3At ﬁnite temperature, we can obtain the expression for conformally invariant correlators by mapping

the the line to a circle [17]:

Q(k) = αQ

Γ[1 − ∆Q + k]

,

S(k) = iαS

Γ[∆S + k + 1/2]
Γ[1 − ∆S + k + 1/2]

k ∈ Z .

(4.12)

For low temperatures and large frequencies these are well approximated by (4.11).

(4.22)

We plot the contours that satisfy the equations in Figure 1. In order for the Euclidean-
time correlators to decay at late times, we require a < 1 and b < 1. Since a = 1 − 2b,
this restricts 0 < b < 1. Notice there is a solution compatible with the equations for
0 < b < 1 with (b, C) ≈ (0.226, 0.128). It is now straightforward to check that our initial

assumption (4.8) is satisﬁed for this solution, so long as:

αS (cid:28) (ωβ)b−1 ,

(ωβ)1/2−2b/˜λ (cid:28) αQ (cid:28) (ωβ)−(1+2b) .

(4.23)

The second inequality further implies that (ωβ)3/2 (cid:28) ˜λ, which at large ˜λ allows for this
solution to be valid for a parametrically large range of ωβ.

The solution found above is not isolated since αQ and αS remain unﬁxed but related
˜λ2). At this point we can compute the on-shell action as a function of
by αQ = Cπ/(α2
S
αS and ﬁnd which value of αS is a critical point. A somewhat tedious calculation yields:

αS ≈ 1.39 × 1
˜λ2/3

.

(4.24)

4.1.2 Supersymmetric solution

Recall that for all values of the disorder ω(cid:126)α, the theory is supersymmetric. At zero
temperature, supersymmetry relates the correlation function of the fermion and boson in
a given supermultiplet as: S(τ, τ(cid:48)) = ∂τ(cid:48)Q(τ, τ(cid:48)). This follows from the supersymmetric
transformation rules acting on (cid:104) ¯ψi,a
α(τ(cid:48))(cid:105) = 0. One can check that it holds explicitly
to low order in a small λ expansion, as discussed in appendix B. In combination with

α (τ )φi

the scaling symmetry at large λ, the quantum mechanics becomes super-conformal [25],

such that the scaling dimensions of the bosons and fermions diﬀers by one-half. This

17

0.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.10.20.30.40.5bCimposes that b = a − 1 which, in combination with (4.5), leads to b = 0 and a = 1.
If, in addition, the supersymmetic ground state preservers scale invariance, the zero

temperature momentum space correlators would behave as:

Q(ωk) =

1
2π

αQ|ωk| ,

S(ωk) = i αS sign(ωk) .

(4.25)

Recall that sign(ωk) scales like a constant. In addition supersymmetry relates αQ = αS
which in turn implies that they both decay as λ−2/3 at large λ. This is consistent with
the behavior of (4.24).

The scaling ansatz (4.25), for which ∆Q = 0 and ∆S = 1/2, has a Fourier trans-
form back to Euclidean time which is logarithmically divergent. This is reminiscent of

logarithmic divergences that appear in conformal ﬁeld theories which often indicate the

presence of a small scaling anomaly [23]. We suspect that this is the case here as well,

and the scaling form of (4.25) is approximate. A natural IR cutoﬀ whose role would

be to tame this logarithmic divergence is the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter θ that appears
in the full quiver theory, including vector multiplets, enforcing that the scalars φi
α take
values in a compact space. The smallness of ∆Q would suggest that the dynamics of
the scalars are eﬀectively frozen as compared to those of the fermions whose correlations

decay in time. In appendix A we discuss a toy model that has fermions with random
masses, that shares some of above features.4

4.2 Thermodynamics

Having solved the saddle point equations, we can compute the on-shell action to leading

order and obtain the thermodynamic features of the system at low temperature in the

paramagnetic phase. For instance the free energy is given by:

F [β, λ] =

1
β

lim
n→0

Seﬀ [β, λ]

n

.

(4.26)

It is convenient to scale out the temperature from the functions Q(u) and S(u), where
u = τ − τ(cid:48). These can be written as functions of the dimensionless quantities u/β, λ2β3
such that:

Q(u; λ2, β) = β ˜Q(u/β; λ2β3) , S(u; λ2, β) = ˜S(u/β; λ2β3) .

(4.27)

4With weight ∆S = 1/2, the low energy theory allows for an SO(3) breaking marginal (at least at

α(τ )(cid:1). Perhaps this is related to the near horizon of

α(τ )σ ˙aaψa

large N ) deformation: J = a ·(cid:82) dτ(cid:0) ¯ψ ˙a

extremally rotating black holes.

18

Only explicit factors of β will play a role when taking derivatives of βF [β, λ], since we

are assuming that Q(u) and S(u) take their on-shell values. Thus we can compute, for
example, the internal energy U [β, λ] = ∂β (βF [β, λ]) as:

U [β, λ]

3N

= − 3
2β

(cid:104)

(cid:88)

k∈Z

2πi (k + 1/2) ˜S(k) + (2πk)2 ˜Q(k)

.

(4.28)

(cid:105)

Notice that when S(k) and Q(k) take their free values, U [β, λ] vanishes. This had
to be the case, since in the absence of any dimensionful parameters, Seﬀ [β] must be
independent of β.

For the non-supersymmetric solution (b, C) ≈ (0.226, 0.128) we ﬁnd the low temper-

ature result (upon ζ-function regularization of the inﬁnite sums):

U [β, λ]

3N

≈ 2.11 × 1
λ2/3

.

(4.29)

(cid:18) 1

(cid:19)2

β

The internal energy of the system grows quadratically with the temperature giving rise

to a speciﬁc heat that is itself linear in the temperature. This resembles the universal

low temperature behavior for the speciﬁc heat of near extremal black holes. A simi-

lar situation holds for the supersymmetric solution. At zero temperature, the entropy

also has a contribution from the supersymmetric ground state degeneracy which is also

extensive in N [9].

5 Quenched Coulomb branch

In our treatment up to now, we have ignored the vector multiplet degrees of freedom Xi =
{xi, λi, Di, Ai} representing the position degrees of freedom of the wrapped branes in the
non-compact (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time. In this section we brieﬂy discuss
the eﬀect of having quenched and random ω(cid:126)α on the Coulomb branch, upon integrating
out the chiral multiplet. The interaction between the two multiplets is dictated by the

following action:

where xij = (xi−xj) and so on.5 As before, if we consider the ω(cid:126)α to be quenched random
variables we can integrate over them and obtain an eﬀective action Seﬀ . The new feature

is that Seﬀ will also be a functional of the vector multiplet degrees of freedom Xi. If we
are interested in the eﬀective action of xi only, we can set λi = 0. Then, after similar
manipulations to those already performed, we obtain a contribution to the eﬀective

action:

(5.2)

In [10] it was shown that in the absence of a superpotential, the eﬀective multi-particle
theory of the xi contained a low energy SL(2, R) invariant sector upon integrating out
the chiral multiplets and taking a large N limit. The scaling dimension of xi in the
low energy sector of the Coulomb branch was found to be ∆x = 1. In order for the
contribution (5.2) to preserve the scale invariance of the (paramagnetic) eﬀective action
(3.3), the scaling dimension of S(τ, τ(cid:48)) would have to vanish. But this is inconsistent
with the scaling dimension of S(τ, τ(cid:48)) we found in the previous section. In other words,
the two SL(2, R) phases of the full quiver theory, the one in the Coulomb branch and
the other in the Higgs branch, are distinct. Going from one to the other, which in the

gravity limit might be viewed as the fragmented tips in the warped throat merging into

a single horizon, resembles an RG ﬂow from one IR ﬁxed point to another. Somewhat
interestingly, ∆x is twice the conformal weight of the fermion for the supersymmetric
solution [26].

A Fermions with random masses

We provide a simple purely fermionic model with random masses as an example a solvable

model, which we can also solve using the replica trick. The Hamiltonian is given by:

H = Jαβ

¯ψαψβ ,

α = 1, 2, . . . , N ,

(A.1)

where Jαβ is an N ×N Hermitean matrix drawn from a Gaussian ensemble with variance
J 2/N . The 2N -dimensional Hilbert space can be decomposed into basis vectors built
from the state |0(cid:105) annihilated by all ψα, where we recall { ¯ψα, ψβ} = δαβ. The basis
vectors are

|αi; n(cid:105) =

¯ψαi|0(cid:105) ,

n ∈ [0, N ] .

(A.2)

n(cid:89)

i=1

A useful quantity characterizing the states is the number of particles n, which is the
eigenvalue of the number operator. For a given n there are CN
n states. The Hamiltonian
becomes block diagonal with N blocks of size CN
n with n = 0, 1, . . . , N . The
corresponding Euclidean action is:

n × CN

(cid:90) β

S =

dτ(cid:0) ¯ψα∂τ ψα − Jαβ

¯ψαψβ

(cid:1) .

0

Since the model is quadratic, it can be solved exactly. For instance, going to thermal

frequency space, the exact two-point function is given by:

(cid:104) ¯ψα(k)ψβ(−k − 1)(cid:105)J = [i ωk ⊗ IN×N − J]

−1
αβ .

(A.4)

We can average the two-point function (cid:104) ¯ψα(k)ψα(−k − 1)(cid:105), with α summed, over the

(A.3)

disorder by computing:(cid:90)

dJαβ e−Jαβ JβαN/2J 2

tr [i ωk ⊗ IN×N − J]

αβ .

(A.5)

This is a standard exercise in matrix integrals. It is known that the eigenvalue distri-

bution of J with Gaussian weight is the Wigner semicircle distribution [24], hence we
must compute (in the β → ∞ limit):

In the matrix model literature this often referred to as the resolvent. Notice that in the

large J limit, the two-point function is approximately given by the sign function just like
the large ˜λ correlator (4.25) found in the main body of the text. We can also compute
the quench averaged free energy :

From this we can derive an expression for the speciﬁc heat:

In the low temperature, β → ∞ limit the speciﬁc heat is linear and goes as C[β, J] ≈
πN/(3Jβ).

We can also solve this model using the techniques outlined in the main body of the
text. Hence we should compute the eﬀective theory of Q(τ, τ(cid:48)). For the paramagnetic
ansatz we ﬁnd:

.

From the above solutions, we pick the one for which the physical condition Q(ω) =
Q(−ω) holds, which is the same as (A.6). In this language we can also compute the
thermodynamic quantities of the model. The internal energy is given by:

where we have used ζ-function regularization to evaluate the sum in the second equality.

As in the quiver model, we ﬁnd an internal energy proportional to the temperature

22

squared, giving rise to a linear in temperature speciﬁc heat C ≈ πN/(3Jβ).

B Perturbative expansion

In this appendix we analyze the perturbative expansion in λ of equations (3.7) and (3.8).
We discuss the solution with all Qi(k) ≡ Q(k) equal and all Si,a(k) ≡ S(k) equal. To
leading order in the small λ expansion, the solutions are:

∀ k ∈ Z .

(B.2)

(B.3)

The next order is found by expanding Qi = Qi
for δSi,a and δQi, we ﬁnd:

0 + δQi and Si,a = Si,a

0 + δSi,a. Solving

and

δSi,a(k) = − 2λ
(2π)3

i

(k + 1/2)3 + O(λ2) ,

δQi(k) = − 2λ

(2πk)4 + O(λ2)

∀ k (cid:54)= 0 .

(B.4)

(B.5)

Notice that the permutation symmetry between the diﬀerent node indices is unbroken.
Also notice that at large k, δSi,a(k) = (2πik) δQi(k) which is consistent with unbroken
supersymmetry.
