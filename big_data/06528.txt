INVARIANT METRICS ON HOMOGENEOUS SPACES WITH EQUIVALENT

ISOTROPY SUMMANDS

MARINA STATHA

Abstract. The space of G-invariant metrics on a homogeneous space G/H is in one-to-one corre-
spondence with the set of inner products on the tangent space m ∼= To(G/H), which are invariant

under the isotropy representation. When all the isotropy summands are inequivalent to each other,
then the metric is called diagonal. We will describe a special class of G-invariant metrics in the
case where the isotropy representation of G/H contains some equivalent isotropy summands. Even
though this problem has been considered sporadically in the bibliography, in the present article we
provide a more systematic and organized description of such metrics. This will enable us to simplify
the problem of ﬁnding G-invariant Einstein metrics for homogeneous spaces. We also provide some
applications.

1. Introduction

A homogeneous manifold M is a manifold which admits a transitive group of diﬀeomorphisms.
However, in general there might be several distinct transitive groups, i.e. non conjugate transitive
subgroups of the diﬀeomorphism group of M , and these subgroups can be abstractly isomorphic. If
we ﬁx a compact Lie group G acting on a homogeneous manifold M , then after choosing a basepoint,
we can write M as the coset space G/H, where H is the isotropy group at the basepoint. From the
theorem of Myers and Steenrod [15] it follows that the isometry group Iso(M ) of M , is a Lie group
and that the isotropy subgroup H is a closed compact subgroup of Iso(M ). One of the fundamental
properties of a homogeneous space is that, if we know the value of a geometrical quantity at a given
point, then we can calculate its value at any other point of G/H by using translation maps. Hence
all calculations reduce to a single point which, for simplicity, can be chosen to be the identity coset
o = eH ∈ G/H.

A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called Einstein if the metric g satisﬁes the condition Ric(g) = λg
for some λ ∈ R. We refer to [7] and [21], [22] for old and new results on homogeneoous Einstein
manifolds. The structure of the set of invariant Einstein metrics on a given homogeneous space is
still not very well understood in general. The situation is only clear for few classes of homogeneous
spaces. For an arbitrary compact homogeneous space G/H it is not clear if the set of invariant
Einstein metrics (up to isometry and up to scaling) is ﬁnite or not. A ﬁniteness conjecture states
that this set is in fact ﬁnite if the isotropy representation of G/H consists of pairwise inequivalent
irreducible components ([9]).

A large class of homogeneous spaces are the reductive homogeneous spaces. For these spaces
there exists a subspace m of g such that g = h ⊕ m and Ad(H)m ⊂ m. The tangent space of
M at o is canonically identiﬁed with m. A major class of reductive homogeneous spaces are the
isotropy irreducible homogeneous spaces. These spaces have been studied by J. Wolf in [25], where
he proved that if G/H is an isotropy irreducible homogeneous space, then G/H admits a unique (up
to scalar) G-invariant metric, which is also Einstein. Later, M. Wang and W. Ziller in [23] and [24],
gave a complete classiﬁcation of such spaces. The most important examples of isotropy irreducible

homogeneous spaces are the irreducible symmetric spaces, classiﬁed by E. Cartan in 1926. More
generally, in [7] it is shown that a non compact irreducible homogeneous space is symmetric. If
the reductive homogeneous space is not isotropy irreducible, then its isotropy representation splits
into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations. Examples of such spaces are the generalized
ﬂag manifolds, Wallach spaces, the projective space CP2n+1 and the Stiefel manifolds.

Generalized ﬂag manifolds with two and four isotropy summands are classiﬁed using a method
based on Riemannian submersions by A. Arvanitoyeorgos and I. Chrysikos in [2], [3]. In general, ho-
mogeneous spaces with two irreducible isotropy summands were classiﬁed by W. Dickinson and M.
Kerr in [11]. This classiﬁcation is achieved under the assumptions that G is a compact, connected
and simple Lie group, H is a closed subgroup of G and G/H is simply connected. It should be noted
that in this classiﬁcation there is only one example of a homogeneous space having equivalent sub-

representations, namely the space SO(8)/ G2
space as well as on the homogeneous spaces Spin(7)/ U(3) ∼= S7× S6, Spin(8)/ U(3) ∼= S7× G+
2 (R8)
and on the Stiefel manifold V2Rn+1 ∼= SO(n+1)/ SO(n−1), where the isotropy representation splits

into equivalent subrepresentations, were classiﬁed by M. Kerr in [14]. The Allof-Wallach spaces
Wk,l = SU(3)/ SO(2) when (k, l) = (1, 0) and (k, l) = (1, 1) are two examples of homogeneous
spaces with equivalent subrepresentations. In general, the space of invariant Riemannian metrics
on Wk,l, is parametrized by four positive parameters. For (k, l) = (1, 0) and (k, l) = (1, 1) this space
depends on 6 and 10 positive real numbers, respectively. By using the variational approach Yu.
Nikonorov in [16] proved that there are at most two invariant Einstein metrics on W1,1. Morever,
he constructed a new invariant Einstein metric on W1,0 which is not diagonal with respect to the
Ad(T )-invariant decomposition of SU(3), where T is a maximal torus in SU(3).
Finally, A. Arvanitoyeorgos, Yu. Nikonorov and V. V. Dzhepko proved that for s > 1 and k > l ≥
3 the Stiefel manifold SO(sk + l)/ SO(l) admits at least four SO(sk + l)-invariant Einstein metrics,
two of which are Jensen’s metrics. The special case SO(2k+l)/ SO(l) admitting at least four SO(2k+
l)-invariant Einstein metrics was treated in [4]. Corresponding results for the quaternionic Stiefel
manifolds Sp(sk + l)/ Sp(l) were obtained in [5]. Recently, it was proved by A. Arvanitoyeorgos, Y.

Sakane and the author in [6], that the Stiefel manifold V4Rn ∼= SO(n)/ SO(n − 4) admits two more
SO(n)-invariant Einstein metrics and that V5R7 ∼= SO(7)/ SO(5) admits four more SO(7)-invariant

Einstein metrics.

In the present paper we study G-invariant metrics on homogeneous spaces G/H for which the
isotropy representation contains equivalent subrepresentations or isotropy summands. For such
spaces the diagonal metrics are not unique. We odserve that the normalizer NG(H) acts on the
space of all G-invariant metrics MG by isometries, and we can choose a subgroup K of NG(H) such
that the action of K on MG determines a subset of MG. Our approach is analysized in Section 3
and is summarized in the following Theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let M = G/H be a homogeneous space of a compact semisimple Lie group G and
let K be a closed subgroup of G such that H ⊂ K ⊂ NG(H), where NG(H) is the normalizer of H
in G.

(1) The non trivial action (ϕ, A) (cid:55)→ ϕ ◦ A ◦ ϕ−1 of the set ΦK = {ϕ = Ad(k)|m : k ∈ K} ⊂ Φ =
{φ = Ad(n)|m : n ∈ NG(H) ⊂ Aut(m), on the set MG of all G-invariant metrics on G/H
is well deﬁned.
(2) The set (MG)ΦK = {A ∈ MG : ϕ◦Aϕ−1 = A for all ϕ ∈ ΦK} of ﬁxed points of the action in
(1) determines a subset of all Ad(H)-invariant inner products on m, called Ad(K)-invariant
inner products. This set in turn, determines a subset MG,K of MG.

Theorems of the above type are useful for the study of geometrical problems (e.g. ﬁnding G-
invariant Einstein metrics) on homogeneous space whose isotropy representation contains equivalent
summands (see for example [6]).
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we recall some useful results from representation
theory. In Section 3 we analyse the action of the normalizer NG(H) on the set of MG of all G-
invariant metrics on G/H. By restricting this action to a closed subgroup K of G such that H ⊂
K ⊂ NG(H), we obtain a subset MG,K of all G-invariant metrics MG. As a consequence, various
geometrical objects (such as Ricci tensor) are easier to by described. In Section 4 we relate such a
choice of subgroup K (i.e. H ⊂ K ⊂ NG(H)) to Riemannian submersions K/H → G/H → G/K.

2. Review of representation theory

A ﬁnite dimensional (real or complex) representation of a Lie group G is a homomorphism
ϕ : G → Aut(V ), where V is a ﬁnite dimensional (real or complex) vector space. The dimension
of the representation is the dimension of the vector space V . If there is no non trivial subspace
W ⊂ V with ϕ(W ) ⊂ W then the representation ϕ called irreducible. The complexiﬁcation of a real
representation ϕ : G → Aut(V ) is deﬁned as the complex representation ϕ ⊗ C : G → Aut(V ⊗ C).
Deﬁnition 2.1. Two representations ϕ1 : G → Aut(V1) and ϕ2 : G → Aut(V2) are called equivalent
(ϕ1
there exists a linear isomorphism
f : V1 → V2 such that f (ϕ1(g)v) = ϕ2(g)f (v), for all g ∈ G and v ∈ V1. Such an f is also called
G-equivariant map (or intertwining map).

∼= V2) if V1 and V2 are G-isomorphic, i.e.

∼= ϕ2 or V1

A useful observation is the following.

Theorem 2.2. (Schur’s Lemma) If ϕ : G → Aut(V ) is an irreducible complex representation
and f ∈ Hom(V, V ) is a G-equivariant map, then f = cId for some c ∈ C.

For every representation ϕ : G → Aut(V ) of a compact topological group G there exists a G-
invariant inner product (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) on V , i.e. (cid:104)ϕ(g)u, ϕ(g)v(cid:105) = (cid:104)u, v(cid:105), for all g ∈ G and u, v ∈ V . From
this it follows that any representation of a compact topological group is a direct sum of irreducible
representations i.e. ϕ ∼= ϕ1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ ϕn : G → Aut(V1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Vn), where each of ϕi : G → Aut(Vi)
If ϕ is a real (resp. complex) irreducible representation and (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)1, (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)2 are two G-invariant
inner products (resp. hermitian inner products) on V , then from the above theorem it follows that
(cid:104)·,·(cid:105)1 = c(cid:104)·,·(cid:105)2, for some c ∈ R (resp. c ∈ C). Therefore, if ϕ ∼= ϕ1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ ϕn and assuming that ϕi

(i = 1, 2, . . . , n) is irreducible.

are mutually inequivalent, then all G-invariant inner products on V are given by

(cid:104)·,·(cid:105) = x1 (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)|V1 + ··· + xn (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)|Vn, xi ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , n

where (cid:104)Vi, Vj(cid:105) = 0 for i (cid:54)= j. Any other G-invariant inner product on V can be expressed as
(·,·) = (cid:104)A·,·(cid:105), where A : V → V is a positive deﬁnite, symmetric, G-equivariant linear map.
If ϕi and ϕj are equivalent for some i and j, then the above inner product is not unique,
and (cid:104)Vi, Vj(cid:105) does not necessarily vanish, thus the matrix of the operator A has some non zero
non diagonal elements. To ﬁnd the number of non diagonal elements, we need to determine the
dimension of the space of intertwining maps between the pairs of equivalent representations. For

example, let ϕ1
of ϕ1 is not necessarily irreducible. After complexifying ϕ1, there are three possibilities ([14]):

∼= ϕ2 and ϕi, i = 1, 2 be irreducible as real representations. The complexiﬁcation

1. If ϕ1 ⊗ C is irreducible, we call ϕ1 orthogonal.
2. If ϕ1 ⊗ C = ψ ⊕ ¯ψ and ψ is not equivalent to ¯ψ, we call ϕ1 unitary.
3. If ϕ1 ⊗ C = ψ ⊕ ¯ψ and ψ is equivalent to ¯ψ, we call ϕ1 symplectic.

The space of intertwining maps is 1-dimensional in the orthogonal case, 2-dimensional in the unitary
case, and 4-dimensional in the symplectic case. Thus if in the decomposition of V = V1⊕V2⊕···⊕Vn
we have r equivalent summands (or modules), then the number of non diagonal elements in the
orthogonal case is r(r−1)
, in the unitary case it is r(r − 1) and in the symplectic case it is 2r(r − 1).
In the present article we describe a special class of G-invariant metrics on a homogeneous spaces
G/H which contain equivalent isotropy summands.
Deﬁnition 2.3. The adjoint representation of G is the homomorphism Ad ≡ AdG : G → Aut(g)
given by Ad(g) = (dIg)e, where Ig : G → G, x (cid:55)→ gxg−1, and g is the Lie algebra of G.

Denote by ˜λn the standard representation of GLnR and by λn the standard representation of
SO(n) (or O(n)). It is λn = ˜λn|SO(n) : GLnR → Aut(Rn). Then the adjoint representation AdSO(n)
of SO(n) (or O(n)) is equivalent to ∧2λn, where ∧2 denotes the second exterior power of λn. Also, we
have that AdU(n) ⊗C = µn ⊗ ¯µn and AdSp(n) ⊗C = S2νn, where µn = ˜µn|U(n) : GLn C → Aut(Cn),
νn = ˜νn|Sp(n) : GLn H → Aut(Hn). Here ˜µn, ˜νn are the standard representations of GLnC and
GLnH respectively, and S2 is the second symmetric power of νn. Recall that if π : G → Aut(V ),
π(cid:48) : G(cid:48) → Aut(W ) are two representations of G and G(cid:48) respectively, then the following identities
are valid:

∧2(π ⊕ π(cid:48)) = ∧2π ⊕ ∧2π(cid:48) ⊕ (π ⊗ π(cid:48)), S2(π ⊕ π(cid:48)) = S2π ⊕ S2π(cid:48) ⊕ (π ⊗ π(cid:48)).

Let M be a smooth manifold and let G be a Lie group acting on M on the left by the map
α : G × M → M, (g, m) (cid:55)→ α(g, m) = gm. For all g ∈ G, let αg : M → M be the corresponding
diﬀeomorphism of M . If H = {g ∈ G : gp = p} is the isotropy subgroup at the point p ∈ M , then
the isotropy representation of H at p is the homomorphism

θ : H −→ Aut(TpM )

h (cid:55)−→ (dαh)p : TpM → TpM,

(1)

where TpM is the tangent space of M at the point p. In the case where the above action is also
transitive, i.e. for p, q ∈ M there exists g ∈ G such that q = gp, then M is diﬀeomorphic to the
homogeneous space G/H, where H is the isotropy subgroup at the identity coset o = eH. By (1)
the isotropy representation of G/H is the homomorphism
AdG/H : H −→ Aut(To(G/H))

h (cid:55)−→ (dτh)o : To(G/H) → To(G/H),

where τh : G/H → G/H, gH (cid:55)→ hgH. A large class of homogeneous spaces are the reductive
homogeneous spaces. For such spaces there exists a subspace m of the Lie algebra g such that
g = h⊕m and Ad(h)m ⊂ m for all h ∈ H, that is m is Ad(H)-invariant. If the subgroup H is compact
such decomposition always exists. Then we have a canonical isomorphism m ∼= To(G/H) given by
(exp(tX))o|t=0, where exp(tX) is the one parameter subgroup of G generated by X.
X ↔ X∗

Proposition 2.4. Let G/H be a reductive homogeneous space and let g = h ⊕ m be a reductive
decomposition of g. Let h ∈ H, X ∈ h and Y ∈ m. Then

that is, the restriction AdG(cid:12)(cid:12)H splits into the sum AdH ⊕ AdG/H .

AdG(h)(X + Y ) = AdG(h)X + AdG(h)Y

We give some examples of computations.

Example 2.5. We consider the homogeneous space G/H = SO(k1 + k2 + k3)/(SO(k1) × SO(k2) ×
SO(k3)) with k1, k2, k3 ≥ 2, which is an example of a generalized Wallach space ([18]). These spaces
were recently classiﬁed independently by Yu. Nikonorov in [17] and Z. Chen, Y. Kang, K. Liang
in [10]. Let σi : SO(k1) × SO(k2) × SO(k3) → SO(ki) be the projection onto the factor SO(ki),
(i = 1, 2, 3) and let pki = λki ◦ σi. Then we have the following:

Observe that the dimension of the representation ∧2pk1 ⊕∧2pk2 ⊕∧2pk3 is(cid:0)k1

⊕ ∧2 pk3 ⊕ (pk1 ⊗ pk2) ⊕ (pk1 ⊗ pk3) ⊕ (pk2 ⊗ pk3).

(cid:12)(cid:12)H = ∧2(pk1 ⊕ pk2 ⊕ pk3) = ∧2pk1 ⊕ ∧2pk2
(cid:1) +(cid:0)k2

AdG(cid:12)(cid:12)H = ∧2λk1+k2+k3

is equal to the dimension of the adjoint representation of H = SO(k1) × SO(k2) × SO(k3), AdH :
SO(k1)× SO(k2)× SO(k3) → Aut(so(k1)⊕ so(k2)⊕ so(k3)). Therefore, the isotropy representation
of G/H is given by

(cid:1), which

AdG/H ∼= (pk1 ⊗ pk2) ⊕ (pk1 ⊗ pk3) ⊕ (pk2 ⊗ pk3),

(2)

which is a direct sum of irreducible and non equivalent subrepresentations of dimensions kikj,
i (cid:54)= j. The tangent space m of G/H decomposes into three Ad(H)-invariant submodules m =
m12 ⊕ m13 ⊕ m23.
Let us consider the case where H1 = SO(l1)×SO(l2)×SO(l3) and l1+l2+l3 < k1+k2+k3−1. Then
we see that the isotropy representation of the homogeneous space G/H1 contains some equivalent
subrepresentations. Indeed,

where n = (k1 + k2 + k3) − (l1 + l2 + l3) and 1n = 1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ 1
. As before, the representation
n−times
∧2pl1 ⊕ ∧2pl2 ⊕ ∧2pl3 is the adjoint representation of H1 = SO(l1) × SO(l2) × SO(l3), thus the
isotropy representation of the homogeneous space G/H1 is

AdG/H1 = 1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ 1 ⊕ (pl1 ⊗ pl2) ⊕ (pl1 ⊗ pl3) ⊕ (pl2 ⊗ pl3)
⊕pl1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ pl1 ⊕ pl2 ⊕ ··· ⊕ pl2 ⊕ pl3 ⊕ ··· ⊕ pl3.

tangent space of G/H1 decomposes into a sum of(cid:0)n

Observe that the last 3n representations of dimensions li, (i = 1, 2, 3) are equivalent. Thus the
Similar result is true if we take H2 = SO(m1) × SO(m2) with m1 + m2 < k1 + k2 + k3 − 1, or
H3 = SO(d) with d < k1+k2+k3−1. In the special case where H4 = SO(k3), then the homogeneous

= AdSp(n)×U(1) ⊗C ⊕ S2µ1 ⊕ S2 ¯µ1

⊕(νn ⊗ µ1) ⊕ (νn ⊗ ¯µ1),

where the fourth equality holds because the dimension of S2νn ⊕(µ1⊗ ¯µ1) is equal to the dimension
of the adjoint representation of Sp(n) × U(1). Hence, the isotropy representation decomposes into
a sum of four irreducible subrepresentations of dimensions 1, 1, 2n and 2n respectively, that is

AdSp(n+1)/ Sp(n)×U(1) ⊗C = S2µ1 ⊕ S2 ¯µ1 ⊕ (νn ⊗ µ1) ⊕ (νn ⊗ ¯µ1).

Thus, the complexiﬁed tangent space m ⊗ C of Sp(n + 1)/ Sp(n) × U(1) is written as a direct sum
of four complex subspaces as m ⊗ C = p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ p3 ⊕ p4. The real subspace m splits into two
real subspaces of dimension 2 and 4n respectively, i.e. m = m1 ⊕ m2, where m ⊗ C = p1 ⊕ p2 and
m2 ⊗ C = p3 ⊕ p4.

It is worth mentioning that W. Ziller in [26] proved that the projective space CP2n+1 ∼= Sp(n +

Observe that in the ﬁrst three cases the isotropy representations are irreducible, which means
that the only G-invariant metric on these spaces is the standard homogeneous Riemannian metric
(i.e. the metric induced by the negative of the Killing form B of g). By J. Wolf ([25]) this metric
is Einstein.

3. A special class of G-invariant metrics on G/H

Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed subgroup so that G acts almost eﬀectively on
G/H. Let g, h be the Lie algebras of G and H and let g = h ⊕ m be a reductive decomposition

8

MARINA STATHA

of g with respect to some Ad(G)-invariant inner product on g, i.e. Ad(h)m ⊂ m for all h ∈ H
where m ∼= To(G/H), o = eH. For G semisimple, the negative of the Killing form B of g is an

Ad(G)-invariant inner product on g, therefore we can choose the above decomposition with respect
to this form. A Riemannian metric g on a homogeneous space G/H is called G-invariant if the
diﬀeomorphism τα : G/H → G/H, τα(gH) = αgH is a isometry. The following proposition gives a
description of G-invariant metrics on homogeneous spaces.

Proposition 3.1. Let G/H be a homogeneous space. Then there exists a one-to-one correspondence
between:

(1) G-invariant metrics g on G/H
(2) AdG/H -invariant inner products (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) on m, that is

(cid:104)AdG/H (h)X, AdG/H (h)Y (cid:105) = (cid:104)X, Y (cid:105)

for all X, Y ∈ m, h ∈ H and

(3) (if H is compact and m = h⊥ with respect to the negative of the Killing form B of G)

AdG/H -equivariant, B-symmetric1 and positive deﬁnite operators A : m → m such that

(cid:104)X, Y (cid:105) = B(A(X), Y ).

We call such an inner product AdG(H)-invariant, or simply Ad(H)-invariant

From the above proposition we can see that the set of all Ad(H)-invariant inner products on m
can be parametrized by Ad(H)-equivariant, symmetric and positive deﬁnite operators A : m → m.
Thus we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Ad(H)-equivariant, symmetric

and positive deﬁnite operator

(cid:27)

.

MG ←→

(cid:26)

It is clear that if m decomposes into a direct sum of Ad(H)-invariant irreducible and pairwise
inequivalent modules mi of dimension di (i = 1, . . . , s), that is m = m1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ ms, then all Ad(H)-
invariant inner products on m are given by

(cid:104)·,·(cid:105) = x1(−B)|m1 + ··· + xs(−B)|ms, xi ∈ R+, i = 1, . . . , s.

In this case the G-invariant metrics are called diagonal. However, if the decomposition of m contains

α1, α2 ∈ R+. The idea behind our approach is to try to eliminate some of the non diagonal elements
in the above matrix, and restrict the study to the diagonal metrics. For the same problem in the
case of a Lie group, K. Y. Ha and J. B. Lee in [13] classiﬁed the left-invariant Riemannian metrics
for each simply connected three-dimensional Lie group up to automorphism. The main idea there
was to identify all automorphisms of the Lie algebra of these groups, and then deﬁne an action of
the automorphism group on the set of all left invariant inner products on the Lie algebras of these
Lie groups2. More precisely, let G be a Lie group and g the corresponding Lie algebra of G. Let
M be the set of all left invariant inner products of g. Then Aut(g) acts on M by

Aut(g) × M → M,

(φ , (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)) (cid:55)→(cid:10)φ−1· , φ−1·(cid:11) .

Under this action we can deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼ on M as follows:

(cid:104)·,·(cid:105) ∼ (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)(cid:48) ⇐⇒ there exists φ ∈ Aut(g) such that (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)(cid:48) = (cid:104)φ−1· , φ−1·(cid:105).

Now, let G/H be a homogeneous space (H is the isotropy subgroup at the identity coset eH) with
reductive decomposition g = h ⊕ m with respect to some Ad(G)-invariant inner product of g. Let
Aut(G, H) be the set of all automorphisms of G which preserve the group H. It can be shown that
if φ ∈ Aut(G, H), then φ induces a G-equivariant diﬀeomorphism ˜φ : G/H → G/H. Then it is
easy to see that this G-equivariant diﬀeomorphism deﬁnes an action on the set of all G-invariant
metrics MG, transforming each G-invariant metric g into a metric isometric to it. In general, every
G-equivariant diﬀeomorphism of G/H is a right translation by an element of NG(H), and for some
α ∈ NG(H) the map α (cid:55)→ Rα, where Rα : G/H → G/H is G-equivariant and sends each gH
to gα−1H. This induces an isomorphism of NG(H)/H onto the group of Aut(G/H) ([8]). Next,
we describe when the set Aut(G/H) ∼= NG(H)/H deﬁnes an action on the set of all G-invariant
metrics MG of a homogeneous space G/H.
First we recall the following fact. Let G1 and G2 be Lie subgroups of a Lie group G. If G1 ⊂ G2,
then G1 is a subgroup of the Lie group G2, and g1 ⊂ g2. Conversely, if g1 ⊂ g2 and the group G1
is connected, then G1 ⊂ G2. From this we have:

Lemma 3.2. (cf. [12]) Let G be a Lie group and H be a closed, connected subgroup of G, with g
and h the corresponding Lie algebras. Then the group NG(H) = {g ∈ G : gHg−1 = H} is equal to
the group NG(h) = {g ∈ G : Ad(g)h ⊂ h}.
Proof. We need to show that (a) NG(H) ⊂ NG(h) and (b) NG(h) ⊂ NG(H). For (a), let g ∈ NG(H).
Then gHg−1 = H and by the above fact we have that ghg−1 = h, i.e. Ad(g)h = h, hence g ∈ NG(h).
For (b), if g ∈ NG(h) then Ad(g)h ⊂ h. Since Ad(g)h is the Lie algebra of gHg−1 and H is connected
it follows that gHg−1 ⊂ H. Obviously H ⊂ gHg−1, hence we obtain that g ∈ NG(H).
(cid:3)

The following proposition is central in our study.

2In general, the group of automorphisms of a Lie group G deﬁnes an action on the set of all metrics on G by
Aut(G) × {metrics on G} → {metrics on G}, (θ, g(·,·)) (cid:55)→ θg(·,·) := gθ(dθ−1·, dθ−1·). Note that if the metric g is
left-invariant, then the metric gθ is not necessarily left-invariant.

Proposition 3.3. Let n ∈ NG(H) and Ad(n) : g → g. Then the operator Ad(n)|m : m → g takes
values in m, that is φ = Ad(n)|m ∈ Aut(m). Also, (Ad(n)|m)−1 = (Ad(n)|m)t.
Proof. Let n ∈ NG(H) and Y ∈ h. Using Lemma 3.2, for any subspace h of g, the normalizer
NG(h) is given by NG(h) = {g ∈ G : Ad(g)h ⊂ h} = NG(H). Therefore, it follows that

Ad(n)Y ∈ h.

(3)

Let X ∈ m = h⊥. Then by using (3) and the Ad(G)-invariance of B we obtain that

B(Ad(n)−1X, Y ) = B(Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n)−1 Ad(n)Y ) = B(X, Ad(n)Y ) = 0,

hence Ad(n)−1X ∈ m. Finally, for n ∈ NG(H) and using the Ad(G)-invariance of B, we have
that B(Ad(n)|mX, Ad(n)|mY ) = B(X, Y ). Since in general it is B(Ad(n)|mX, Ad(n)|mY ) =
B(X, (Ad(n)|m)t Ad(n)|mY ), it follows that (Ad(n)|m)−1 = (Ad(n)|m)t.
(cid:3)
Consider the set Φ = {φ = Ad(n)|m : n ∈ NG(H)}. Then by Proposition 3.3 Φ is contained in

Aut(m), hence we can deﬁne the isometric action3

Φ × MG → MG,

(φ , A) (cid:55)→ φ ◦ A ◦ φ−1 ≡ ˜A.

(4)

Lemma 3.4. The action of Φ on MG is well deﬁned.
Proof. We need to show that the operator ˜A is

(a) Ad(H)-equivariant, i.e. Ad(H) ◦ ˜A = ˜A ◦ Ad(H) or

Ad(H) ◦ ˜A ◦ Ad(H)−1 = ˜A and

(b) B-symmetric and positive deﬁnite.
For (a), let n ∈ NG(H) and we compute:

Ad(H) ◦ ˜A ◦ Ad(H)−1 = Ad(H) ◦(cid:0) Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1(cid:1) ◦ Ad(H)−1
= Ad(n) ◦(cid:0) Ad(H) ◦ A ◦ Ad(H)−1(cid:1) ◦ Ad(n)−1

= Ad(Hn) ◦ A ◦ Ad(Hn)−1
= Ad(nH) ◦ A ◦ Ad(nH)−1

= Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1 = ˜A.

In the third equality we used the fact that n ∈ NG(H), and in the ﬁfth equality the fact that the
operator A is Ad(H)-equivariant. For (b), let X, Y ∈ m. We will show that the operator ˜A is
B-symmetric:

B( ˜AX, Y ) = B(Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, Y )

= B(Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n) Ad(n)−1Y )
= B(A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n)−1Y )
= B(Ad(n)−1X, A ◦ Ad(n)−1Y )
= B(Ad(n) Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1Y )
= B(X, ˜AY ).

In the third and ﬁfth equality we used that the Killing form B is Ad(G)-invariant and in the fourth
equality we used the fact that the operator A is B-symmetric. Finally, we show that ˜A is positive

3This action is essentially the action of NG(H) on MG, or equivalently the action of the group NG(H)/H on MG.

deﬁnite. Let X ∈ m with X (cid:54)= 0. Then by Proposition 3.3 we have that Ad(n)X ∈ m for all
n ∈ NG(H), therefore it is

B( ˜AX, X) = B(Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, X)

= B(Ad(n) ◦ A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n) Ad(n)−1X)
= B(A ◦ Ad(n)−1X, Ad(n)−1X)
= B(A(Ad(n)−1X), Ad(n)−1X) > 0

(cid:3)
where in the third equality we used that the Killing form B is Ad(G)-invariant.
Corollary 3.5. Let n ∈ NG(H). Then the metrics corresponding to the operator A are equivalent,
up to the automorphism Ad(n) : m → m, to the metrics corresponding to the operator ˜A.
Example 3.6. ([14]) We consider the Stiefel manifold V2R4 ∼= SO(4)/ SO(2) and we will describe

all SO(4)-invariant metrics. A reductive decomposition m of the Lie algebra so(4), with respect to
∈ so(4), is
negative of Killing form B(·,·) of SO(4), and for the embedding of so(2) (cid:44)→

where Eij denotes the 4× 4 matrix with 1 in (ij)-entry and 0 elsewhere. According to Example 2.5
the isotropy representation of SO(4)/ SO(2) is AdSO(4)/ SO(2) = 1 ⊕ λ2 ⊕ λ2, thus m can be written
as a direct sum of three Ad(SO(2))-invariant subspaces, of dimensions 1, 2, 2 as follows

m = m1 ⊕ m2 ⊕ m3.

(cid:19)

Hence m1 = span{e12}, m2 = span{e1j : j = 3, 4} and m3 = span{e2j : j = 3, 4}. Observe that
m1 = so(2) (cid:44)→
∈ so(4). Since in the isotropy representation the last two representations
are equivalent and λ2 ⊗ C ∼= λ2, the space of intertwining maps is 1-dimensional. Therefore,
Proposition 3.1 implies that the matrix of the Ad(SO(2))-equivariant, symmetric and positive
deﬁnite operator A : m → m with respect to some (−B)-orthonormal basis adapted to m, is given

Similarly, we obtain that

Ad(exp(te12))e23 = sin t · e13 + cos t · e23,
Ad(exp(te12))e24 = sin t · e14 + cos t · e24.

In the above calculations we used the fact that for any matrix group G we have that Ad(g)X =

x3) sin2 t − 2α sin t cos t. Obviously, we can ﬁnd t such that m = (x3 − x2) sin t cos t + α cos 2t = 0.
Therefore, without loss of generality, and since A and ˜A are isometric, we can assume that the
matrix of the operator A is such that α = 0 (i.e. diagonal).

The important points in the previous example are that, we have exactly one non diagonal element
in the matrix of the metric (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) = −B(A·,·) and that the normalizer of SO(2) in SO(4) is the circle
S1 ∼= SO(2). These enable us to eliminate the non diagonal element, since it is possible to describe

the complete action of the normalizer on the space of all G-invariant metrics. This situation occurs
in [14]. In the case where the group NG(H) (or NG(H)/H) is isomorphic to some other Lie group
(see for example [16]) then it is more complicated to describe explicitly the action of NG(H) on
MG, so we try to conﬁne our study in a suitable subset of MG.

From the action (4) we obtain the following interesting consequenses. Let
(MG)Φ = {A ∈ MG : φ ◦ A ◦ φ−1 = A for all φ ∈ Φ}

be the set of all ﬁxed points4 of the action Φ on MG (which is subset of MG). Any element of
(MG)Φ parametrizes all Ad(NG(H))-invariant inner products of m and thus deﬁnes a subset of all
inner product on m. Since H ⊂ NG(H), Proposition 3.1 can be restated as follows:

Proposition 3.7. Let G/H be a homogeneous space. Then there exists a one-to-one correspondence
between:

(1) G-invariant metrics on G/H,
(2) Ad(H)-invariant inner products (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) on m,
4Let G be a Lie group and M a manifold. Consider the action of G on M : G × M → M, (g, m) (cid:55)→ g · m. The

subset M G = {m ∈ M : g · m = m for all g ∈ G} of M is called the ﬁxed point set of the action.

Observe that (MG)Φ ⊂ (MG)ΦH .

In the case where NG(H) (cid:54)= S1, we can work with some
appropriate closed subset K of the Lie group G, such that H ⊂ K ⊂ NG(H). Then the ﬁxed point
set of the non trivial action of the set ΦK = {ϕ = Ad(k)|m : k ∈ K} ⊂ Φ on MG is

(MG)ΦK = {A ∈ MG : ϕ ◦ A ◦ ϕ−1 = A for all ϕ ∈ ΦK},

and this set determines a subset of all Ad(K)-invariant inner products of m. We have the inclusions

In the special case where H = {e}, then NG(H) = G, thus the ﬁxed points of the action (4) are
the Ad(G)-invariant inner products on g, which correspond to the bi-invariant metrics on the Lie
group G.

We will now make an appropriate choice of the subgroup K in G.

Proposition 3.8. Let K be a subgroup of G with H ⊂ K ⊂ G and such that K = L× H, for some
subgroup L of G. Then K is contained in NG(H).

14

MARINA STATHA

Proof. We will show that if k = (l, h) ∈ K = L × H then kHk−1 = H (that is k ∈ NG(H)). We

identify H with {e} × H, where {e} is the identity element of G, so we will show that k(cid:0){e} ×
H(cid:1)k−1 = {e} × H. It is

k(cid:0){e} × H(cid:1)k−1 = (l, h)(cid:0){e} × H(cid:1)(l, h)−1 = (l, h)(cid:0){e} × H(cid:1)(l−1, h−1)

= (l, h)(e, X)(l−1, h−1), for all X ∈ H
= (l, hX)(l−1, h−1) = (ll−1, hXh−1) = (e, hXh−1)
= {e} × H,
hence K = L × H ⊂ NG({e} × H) = NG(H).
Also from [20] we have the following result:

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.9. Let the group G and the subgroup H of G. Then H (cid:47) NG(H) ≤ G, and whenever
H (cid:47) J ≤ G, then J is a subgroup of NG(H) (here A (cid:47) G means that A is a normal subgroup of G).

4. Ad(K)-invariant metrics and Riemannian submersions

In the present section we will relate the Ad(K)-invariant metrics on G/H deﬁned in the previous
section, to Riemannian submersions. For H ⊂ K ⊂ G such that K ⊂ NG(H), we consider the
ﬁbration

K/H → G/H → G/K.

Let a and p be the orthogonal complements of h in k (i.e. k = h ⊕ a), and of k in g (i.e. g = k ⊕ p),
with respect to the negative of the Killing form of g. We assume that a is also Ad(K)-invariant
subspace of k. The spaces a and p are called vertical and horizontal subspaces of g. Then we have
the decomposition g = h ⊕ m = h ⊕ a ⊕ p.

Any Ad(K)-invariant inner product on p deﬁnes a G-invariant metric ˇg on G/K and any Ad(H)-
invariant inner product on a deﬁnes a K-invariant metric ˆg on K/H. The direct sum of these inner
products on a ⊕ p deﬁnes a G-invariant metric

g = ˆg + ˇg

(5)

on G/H, called submersion metric. As this metric can be determined by an Ad(K)-invariant inner

product on m ∼= To(G/H) = a ⊕ p, it corresponds to an element of (MG)ΦK , as deﬁned in the

previous section. Hence we have the following:

Proposition 4.1. Let M = G/H be a homogeneous space and let K be a closed subgroup of G
chosen as in the Proposition 3.8. Then the metric (5) is an element of (MG)ΦK .
Example 4.2. Let M = G/H = SO(k1 + k2 + k3)/ SO(k3) (k1, k2, k3 ≥ 2) be the Stiefel manifold
Rk1+k2+k3, and let K = L × H = (SO(k1) × SO(k2)) × SO(k3). Then by Proposition 3.8 it
Vk1+k2
is K ⊂ NG(H). We consider the ﬁbration

SO(k1) × SO(k2) × SO(k3)

SO(k3)

/ SO(k1 + k2 + k3)

SO(k3)

SO(k1 + k2 + k3)

SO(k1) × SO(k2) × SO(k3)

Then the base space G/K is a generalized Wallach space and it is known by Example 2.5 (cf. (2))
that the isotropy representation is a direct sum of three non equivalent subrepresentations. There-

fore, the tangent space p ∼= To(G/K) decomposes into three Ad(K)-invariant and non equivalent

INVARIANT METRICS ON HOMOGENEOUS SPACES WITH EQUIVALENT ISOTROPY SUMMANDS

modules p12 ⊕ p13 ⊕ p23 of dimensions kikj, i (cid:54)= j. The tangent space a ∼= To(K/H) of the ﬁber
K/H is the Lie algebra so(k1)⊕ so(k2), and it is Ad(H)-invariant. Also a is Ad(K)-invariant, thus
the tangent space m ∼= To(G/H) of the total space G/H can be written as m = a ⊕ p, and thus

decomposed into ﬁve Ad(K)-invariant non equivalent modules:

m = a ⊕ p = so(k1) ⊕ so(k2) ⊕ p12 ⊕ p13 ⊕ p23.

Therefore, any Ad(K)-invariant metric is diagonal and determined by Ad(K)-invariant inner prod-
ucts on m of the form:

(cid:104)·,·(cid:105) = x1 (−B)|so(k1) + x2 (−B)|so(k2)

+x12 (−B)|p12 + x13 (−B)|p13 + x23 (−B)|p23.

These inner products are the Ad(K)-invariant inner products of Figure 2.

New invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold Vk1+k2
with respect to the above inner products, were studied in [6].

Rk1+k2+k3 ∼= SO(k1+k2+k3) / SO(k3),
