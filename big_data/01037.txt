We study the response of classical impurities in quantum Ising chains. The Z2 degeneracy they
entail renders the existence of two decoupled Majorana modes at zero energy an exact property of
a ﬁnite system at arbitrary values of its bulk parameters. We trace the evolution of these modes
across the transition from the disordered phase to the ordered one and analyze the concomitant
qualitative changes of local magnetic properties of an isolated impurity. In the disordered phase,
the two ground states diﬀer only close to the impurity, and they are related by the action of an
explicitly constructed quasi-local operator.
In this phase the local transverse spin susceptibility
follows a Curie law. The critical response of a boundary impurity is logarithmically divergent and
maps to the two-channel Kondo problem, while it saturates for critical bulk impurities, as well as in
the ordered phase. The results for the Ising chain translate to the related problem of a resonant level
coupled to a 1d p-wave superconductor or a Peierls chain, whereby the magnetic order is mapped
to topological order. We ﬁnd that the topological phase always exhibits a continuous impurity
response to local ﬁelds as a result of the level repulsion of local levels from the boundary Majorana
zero mode. In contrast, the disordered phase generically features a discontinuous magnetization or
charging response. This diﬀerence constitutes a general thermodynamic ﬁngerprint of topological
order in phases with a bulk gap.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years there was a substantial boost in the search for signatures of Majorana zero modes (MZM)
that may emerge as localized quasiparticles in various condensed matter realizations, because of their po-
tential for quantum computation1,2. MZMs occuring at boundaries or defects (domain walls and vortices)
in low-dimensional topological superconductors are of particular importance because of their non-Abelian
anyonic statistics that uncovers new prospects for storage and manipulation of quantum information3,4.

In his seminal paper Kitaev5 proposed a one-dimensional model of a spinless p-wave superconductor

(1DPS)

(the usual negative sign of the hopping term can be obtained by the transformation an → (−1)nan, which
changes the signs of t and ∆). This model has a topologically non-trivial massive phase that supports localized
Majorana modes at the ends of the chain. For a macroscopically large system these boundary modes can be
regarded as unpaired, in which case they represent a non-local realization of a doubly degenerate fermionic
zero-energy state. The spatial separation of the two MZMs ensures the immunity of the topologically
degenerate ground state of the 1DPS against weak local perturbations (as long as quasi-particle poisoning
can be neglected, and thus fermion parity is conserved), making such a system potentially useful for the needs
of quantum computation. Thus it is of great theoretical interest and practical importance to identify the
physical properties of the edge of such a 1D system that can serve as evidence for the existence of boundary
MZMs.

It has soon been realized that principal features of the Kitaev 1D model5 can be reproduced experimentally
using a quantum wire with a strong spin-orbit coupling in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld and
the proximity eﬀect with a conventional s-wave superconducting substrate6,7. Much theoretical and experi-
mental eﬀort is currently going into ﬁnding unambiguous signatures of MZMs in various set-ups. Important
steps forward in this direction include tunneling spectroscopy experiments8,9, whose ﬁndings, in particular,

the zero-bias conductance peak observed in one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor contacts, were
consistent with theoretical predictions (see Ref. 1 for a recent review).

Closely related to the 1DPS model is the quantum Ising chain (QIC), described by the Hamiltonian:

Here σα
n are Pauli matrices, J > 0 is the exchange interaction and h is a transverse magnetic ﬁeld which
endows the spins with quantum dynamics. The model possesses a Z2-symmetry associated with the global
transformation PSσx
j , [H, PS] = 0. This is an exactly solvable quantum 1D
model which, by virtue of the transfer matrix formalism, is related to the classical 2D Ising model11–13. The
Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation maps the many-body problem (2) onto a quadratic model of spinless
fermions, the latter actually being a particular realization of the 1DPS (1) with a ﬁne-tuned pairing amplitude
∆ = ±t. Close to criticality, in the ﬁeld-theoretical limit, the QIC represents a (1+1)-dimensional theory
of a massive Majorana fermion13. The topological phase of the 1DPS corresponds to the ordered phase of
the QIC, which (in the thermodynamic limit) is characterized by spontaneously broken symmetry and a
two-fold degeneracy of the ground state (up to an exponentially small splitting). The ordered phase (J > h)
is separated from the topologically trivial, disordered phase (J < h) by a quantum critical point (J = h).
As follows from the Kramers-Wannier duality12,13, the two massive phases of the QIC (2) have identical
bulk spectrum; however, they diﬀer in the boundary conditions at the edges of a ﬁnite chain, reﬂecting their
topological distinction.

This diﬀerence is clearly seen from the Kitaev-Majorana (KM) representation of the QIC5,14: the N -site
spin chain (2) is equivalent to a 2N -site tight-binding model of real (Majorana) fermions with nearest-
neighbor couplings, as will be brieﬂy reviewed below:

c†i = ci,

{ci, cj} = 2δij.

(3)

In the representative limits h/J → 0 and J/h → 0 a greatly simpliﬁed qualitative picture emerges. For h → 0
one ﬁnds two decoupled boundary MZMs, c1 and c2N , in the otherwise dimerized chain, implying a two-fold
degeneracy of the ground state, while for J → 0 the KM lattice has a full dimer covering and the ground state
is unique. At ﬁnite h/J < 1 the exact degeneracy between the two boundary MZMs in the ordered phase
is removed. In spin language, the level splitting is caused by quantum tunneling between the two classical
Ising vacua caused by the propagation of a magnetization kink from one end of the chain to the other. For
a macroscopically long chain, the tunnelling amplitude is exponentially small, teﬀ ∼ J exp(−L/ξ) (L and ξ
being the length of the chain and the correlation length, respectively). However, within this accuracy the
two boundary Majorana modes remain true zero modes, and their existence implies the two-fold degeneracy
of the ground state in the ordered phase of the QIC.

It is worth mentioning that the usefulness of the Majorana fermions in the QIC hinges on the exact Z2
symmetry of the spin model (2). Local terms (in the σx or σy) which break the Ising symmetry induce
non-local couplings among the Majoranas and spoil the degeneracy of the edge modes.
In contrast, the
topological phase of the 1DPS is robust against any local perturbations in the fermionic basis. Nevertheless,
within the symmetry protected sector, the QIC exhibits very similar physical properties as the 1DPS.

In this paper we aim at identifying clear physical diﬀerences associated with the presence or absence of
Majorana edges modes in the topologically ordered or non-ordered phases, respectively. We focus on the
eﬀects of an impurity that interrupts an otherwise homogeneous 1d chain, or terminates it. We study its
spectral weight and its response to locally applied external ﬁelds. Our main result is the ﬁnding summarized
in Table I: the local susceptibility of such an impurity can serve as a probe for Majorana edges modes
in the adjacent bulk phase(s). In particular, we ﬁnd that the non-topological phase is characterized by a
discontinuity in the polarization response of the impurity to an external ﬁeld, and a concomitant divergence
of the susceptibility. In contrast, topological order and the associated MZMs quench such a divergence. This
eﬀect may serve as a thermodynamic, equilibrium tool in the search for direct traces of Majorana edge modes,
which so far have been sought mostly in transport properties at zero bias.

TABLE I: The response of an impurity to local ﬁelds reveals the nature of the chain that it couples to. Ising spin chains
and spinless p-wave superconductors are closely analogous. At T = 0, the spin σ0 undergoes a discontinuous ﬂip at
h0 = 0 in the paramagnetic phase, where a dressed free spin remains localized at the edge. On the ferromagnetic side,
the spontaneously broken symmetry in the ground state generates a longitudinal ﬁeld on the impurity and renders the
transverse magnetization response m0(h0) smooth. Upon JW transformation the Ising system maps to a single-level
quantum dot which couples to a 1d p-wave superconductor. Thereby the dot’s occupation n0 as a function of the
local potential µ0 takes the role of m0(h0). In the topologically trivial phase the level localized on the quantum dot
can be driven through zero energy, inducing a discontinuous jump in n0(µ0). In this case, generic local couplings will
shift the jump to arbitrary µc. In contrast, in the topological phase the coupling to the boundary Majorana zero
mode repels the energy of the localized boundary state away from zero and thus renders n0(µ0) smooth. This paper
analyzes the impurity response in the various phases, especially close to the degeneracy point (h0 = 0 or µ0 = µc).
The susceptibility has Curie-like divergence in the disordered phase, while it saturates in the ordered phase. At
criticality, the problem maps to the 2-channel Kondo eﬀect, and accordingly, the susceptibility is a logarithmically
diverging function of temperature.

4

For illustrative purposes and analytical convenience we focus on the QIC model in which the presence of
impurities of a certain kind enforces all energy levels of the system to be two-fold degenerate even for a ﬁnite
system. The impurities we have in mind represent lattice sites where the local transverse magnetic ﬁeld
vanishes. The spins residing at these sites are unable to ﬂip and, therefore, are classical. The Z2 degeneracy
of the ground state makes the existence of two decoupled Majorana modes at zero energy an exact property
of a ﬁnite system at arbitrary values of the bulk parameters J and h. The goal of this work is to trace
the evolution of the associated MZMs across the transition from the disordered phase to the ordered one
and describe the corresponding qualitative changes of measurable quantitites – the spectral weight (density
of states) of the impurity spin and the local magnetic susceptibility deﬁned as the linear response to a
small transverse magnetic ﬁeld. For a 1D p-wave superconductor the equivalent quantities are the average
occupancy of the impurity fermionic level and the local charge susceptibility.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we brieﬂy overview the QIC in the KM representation, which
in Sec. III is used to qualitatively describe the main features of a quantum Ising chain containing classical-
spin impurities: the presence of a free local spin with a local Curie susceptibility in the disordered phase, its
delocalization at the phase transition and the transformation of the spectral degeneracy from locally diﬀering
groundstates to globally diﬀering Ising symmetry-broken states.

In Sec. IV we explicitly construct a triplet of conserved operators which obey the standard spin 1/2
algebra, and are quasi-local in the disordered phase. We relate their existence to the integrable character of
the considered models, and compare with similar conserved operators in many-body localized systems.

In Sec. V we consider a single classical impurity in an Ising chain close to criticality. Taking the scaling
limit, we establish the connection with massive versions of previously studied resonant-level models where
the impurity couples to two channels of Majorana fermions, and we explain how to compute the observables
of interest using the Green’s functions of the auxiliary Majorana fermions. Sec. VI contains our central
results for a boundary impurity. We evaluate the impurity spectral weight in both phases and calculate the
temperature dependence of the transverse susceptibility of the impurity spin ﬁnding a rich behavior across
the quantum critical window. At criticality, the QIC with a boundary impurity coincides with the Majorana
resonant-level model discussed earlier by Emery and Kivelson10 in their studies of the two-channel Kondo
problem. In this regime the impurity spin has a logarithmically divergent low-temperature susceptibility.
This is intermediate between the Curie asymptotics of the disordered phase and the saturating susceptibility
in the ordered phase. Sec. VIII establishes the connection with the one-dimensional p-wave superconductors
to which the QIC maps under JW transformation. In particular, we ﬁnd that the local compressibility of
an impurity site (a quantum dot coupled to a superconducting wire) provides a thermodynamic signature of
the presence or absence of topological order in the superconductor: The topological phase with its boundary
Majorana zero mode forces the charge occupation of the quantum dot to be a smooth function of local
potential acting on the dot. This is in contrast to the topologically trivial superconducting phase of the
wire, in the presence of which the occupation of the dot generically undergoes discrete jumps as a function
of applied gate voltage. Sec. VII analyzes an impurity in the bulk and summarizes the salient features of
the susceptibility, and how it diﬀers from a boundary impurity. The symmetrically coupled impurity is
shown to map to a semi-inﬁnite Peierls chain coupled to a boundary impurity. The concluding section IX
summarizes the main results, and discusses how generally topological order in 1 dimension may be detected
by the absence of discontinuous response to local ﬁelds acting on impurities.

Majorana structure of the Hamiltonian (5) is manifest. A physical site j of the original lattice, shown as a
box in Fig. 1, is associated with a local Fock space of the complex fermion (aj, a†j). Each physical site can
then be split into a pair of ”Majorana” sites, shown by crosses in Fig. 1, where real fermion operators {cj}
are deﬁned,

c2j−1 = a†j + aj, c2j = −i(a†j − aj), {cj, cl} = 2δjl.

The Hamiltonian (5) then transforms into the 2N -site KM lattice model (3). At J 6= h the translational
invariance of the KM lattice (3) is broken, entailing a spectral gap. For later purposes, it is crucial to keep
in mind that the transverse ﬁeld h tends to pair the c-fermions belonging to the same physical site, while
the exchange interaction J couples fermions belonging to neighboring boxes.

Thereby it maps the Hamiltonian (2) into the same model, but with J and h interchanged, up to boundary
terms. In the KM representation (3), the non-local transformation (7) simply reduces to a translation by
one lattice spacing.

III. CLASSICAL IMPURITY SPINS IN QUANTUM ISING CHAIN: QUALITATIVE PICTURE

Consider the ordered phase of an inhomogeneous QIC with locally varying transverse magnetic ﬁelds hn.
Imagine that a magnetization kink, separating two classical Ising vacua with opposite spin polarizations,
travels along the chain from its left end to the right one, with each elementary step being associated with
a spin reversal caused by a nonzero local ﬁeld hn. For hn ≪ J the vacuum-vacuum tunneling amplitude is
proportional to (one can always assume that hn ≥ 0)

Therefore, if at some lattice site the local ﬁeld vanishes, teﬀ vanishes as well implying that the boundary
Majorana modes become true degenerate zero modes, even for ﬁnite N. Physically, this follows from the fact

teﬀ≈J

N

Yn=1(cid:18) hn
J (cid:19) .

(8)

that at the impurity site spin reversal is impossible. The spin localized at such a site is classical, i.e., unable
to ﬂip. For a kink moving along the chain the zero-ﬁeld site represents an inﬁnitely high barrier which blocks
its further propagation. Mixing of the boundary Majorana states located at the opposite boundaries thus
becomes impossible; hence an exact Z2 degeneracy of the ground state.

Let us make this statement more precise. Consider a QIC with a zero-h impurity, say at n = 0:

H = −JXn

σx
nσx

n+1 − hXn6=0

σz
n.

(9)

There are two operators, σx
with each other. Each of these operators squares to unity. If ψσ is an eigenstate of both H and σx
0 ,

n, which commute with the Hamiltonian, but anticommute

n=1 σz

0 and PS = QN

Hψσ = Eψσ,

σx
0 ψσ = σψσ (σ = ±1)

then the anticommutation relation {σx
0 , PS} = 0 implies that the state ψ′σ′ = PSψσ is also an eigenstate of
H with the same energy E but with σ′ = −σ. Hence all energy levels of the system are two-fold degenerate
at arbitrary J/h. This conclusion remains obviously valid for an arbitrary number Ni of zero-ﬁeld impurities
in which case the Hamiltonian has the form:

H = −JXn

σx
nσx

n+1 − h Xn /∈J

σz
n,

(10)

where J is the set of all impurity sites. Obviously, H commutes with PS and the Ni operators σx
m (m ∈
J ). The operators σx
m commute among each other, whereas all of them anticommute with PS. Since PS
simultaneously inverts the signs of the eigenvalues of all impurity spins σx
m, by the same argument as before
one concludes that the energy levels of the many-impurity model are also two-fold degenerate (but generically
there is no higher degeneracy). Thus, irrespective of the nature of the bulk phase, ordered or disordered, the
ground state of a QIC with classical impurity spins is Z2-degenerate.

FIG. 2: KM representation of QIC with hj = h(1 − δj0).

To understand how this degeneracy is physically realized in the disordered and ordered bulk phases, let us
look at the KM representation of a ﬁnite QIC with a zero-ﬁeld impurity at the origin. Let M1 and M2 be the
numbers of the lattice sites to the left and to the right of the impurity site, the total number of physical sites
being N = M1 + M2 + 1. The pattern of pairings of neighboring c-operators on the corresponding KM lattice
is displayed in Fig. 2. The operators c−1 and c0 shown by two squares originate from the impurity site n = 0.
As opposed to all other c-operators, these two operators are unpaired, hc−1c0i = 0, because h0 = 0. As a
consequence, the the impurity cuts the KM chain in Fig. 2 into two disconnected pieces containing 2M1 + 1
and 2M2 + 1 sites, respectively. Since these numbers are odd, the emerging situation is special because a
piece of a Majorana lattice with an odd number of sites does not represent a segment of the original physical
lattice where the spins σα

n are deﬁned.

FIG. 3: QIC with several classical (zero-ﬁeld) impurities in the KM representation

Local ﬂuctuations of the Hamiltonian parameters can indeed cut the KM lattice into disconnected pieces.
This can be due to vanishing local values of J or h at certain links or sites. The former case is trivial:

7

randomly distributed links with vanishing exchange couplings cut the original spin chain into segments,
each representing a smaller-size chain with open boundaries. On the KM lattice, each disconnected segment
contains an even number of sites. This picture should be contrasted with the situation emerging in a QIC
containing sites with vanishing local magnetic ﬁelds. An example is shown in Fig. 3. For a spin chain with Ni
impurities, the corresponding KM lattice decouples into Ni + 1 pieces: Ni − 1 of them contain even numbers
of c-sites and two more pieces with odd numbers of sites are attached to the boundaries.

Now, a ﬁnite KM chain with an odd number of sites necessarily contains an exact MZM. Indeed, the

Hamiltonian of such a chain is a quadratic form H = iPjk Ajkcjck, where Ajk is a real, antisymmetric
N × N matrix, where N is odd. Consequently, det ˆA = 0 and so the set of eigenvalues of ˆA necessarily
contains a zero eigenvalue. So a ﬁnite QIC with a classical-spin impurity should have two exact MZMs.
To understand where these zero modes are located, it is instructive to turn again to the limiting cases
h = 0, J 6= 0 and J = 0, h 6= 0. Considering for instance the right segment of the KM chain in Fig. 2, one
ﬁnds that a KM chain with an odd number of sites contains a zero mode at the right boundary if J > h
or at the left boundary if J < h. For the left segment of the KM chain the situation is just inverted. The
boundary MZM will have a ﬁnite localization radius at any J 6= h and move from one boundary to the other
as the critical point is crossed.

We thus arrive at the following physical picture for a QIC with an impurity spin in the bulk.

In the
disordered phase the two MZMs are located close to the impurity site.
In this phase, the free impurity
spin of the limit J → 0 retains its identity, despite getting dressed and delocalizing over a ﬁnite length
scale ξ: the local transverse spin susceptibility, deﬁned as the linear response to a small transverse ﬁeld h0,
follows a Curie law: χ0 ∼ T −1. The impurity zero modes are fragile because they are not spatially separated:
application of a small transverse local ﬁeld h0 will produce Zeeman splitting of the zero-energy levels and
polarize the impurity spin in the z-direction.

Once the system passes over to the ordered phase, the exact Z2 degeneracy becomes a non-local property
of the ground state. The free impurity spin ”disappears” because it gets strongly coupled to the rest of the
system by the classical Ising exchange. The local spin susceptibility χ0 is ﬁnite in the zero-temperature limit.
However, in agreement with the Kitaev’s picture5, the disappearance of the impurity spin in the ordered
phase is accompanied, in the fermionic language, by the appearance of two spatially separated MZMs at the
end-points of the chain. In other words, these boundary zero modes represent what the spectral weight of
the local impurity spin transforms into when the system undergoes the quantum phase transition from the
disordered to the ordered phase. Let us stress again that these are exactly degenerate boundary MZMs in a
ﬁnite quantum Ising chain – an eﬀect caused by the zero-ﬁeld impurity, which kills the tunneling between
the Ising vacua.

Consider now the case of a ﬁnite number Ni of classical-spin impurities. As already explained, there should
again be two exact MZMs in the ground state. In the ordered phase, the Kitaev’s picture5 of two boundary
MZMs at the end-points of the chain is intact. In the disordered phase there are 2Ni boundary Majorana
modes localized in the vicinity of Ni impurity spins. However, as follows from Fig. 3, only two of them are
exact MZMs, namely those located at the right and left ends of the left and right odd-number segments of
the KM chain, respectively. The Majorana modes residing at the boundaries of the inner (even-site) pieces
of the KM chain overlap and split. Nevertheless, in the dilute limit of rare impurities separated by distances
much larger than the correlation length, the level splitting of the boundary modes of each even-site inner
segment is exponentially small, and one can think of 2Ni MZMs in the disordered phase, forming Ni nearly
free spins. This is the limit in which the interaction between the impurity spins can be neglected and the
symmetry of the disordered phase gets approximately promoted to [Z2]Ni.

The diﬀerence between the numbers of the Majorana (quasi-)zero modes in the ordered and disordered
phase of the dilute impurity system (see Fig. 4) originates from the non-trivial topological property of the
inner pieces of the KM lattice. In spite of having even numbers of c-sites, these pieces do not represent
parts of the original spin chain deﬁned in terms of the σα
n operators. Indeed, the sequence of Majorana links
in a ﬁnite QIC is [hJhJ ··· hJh], whereas in all inner even-site pieces the sequence of links is diﬀerent:
[JhJh ··· JhJ]. For these pieces it is impossible to form local spin operators by pairing the c-operators
according to the usual rule [12] [34] ···
[2M-1, 2M]. It can be readily seen that, for the inner pieces of
the KM lattice, the pattern of pairing neighbors actually corresponds to the dual lattice of links, i.e., the
lattice of the disorder µα
n-operators, Eq. (7). Thus the inner even-site segments of Fig. 3 can be treated as

(a) disordered phase: 2Nimp Majorana quasi-zero modes; (b)

As a consequence of this curious fact, in the inner regions of the QIC separated by zero-ﬁeld impurities,
the zero boundary modes appear only in the disordered phase. Therefore for these regions it is the spin
disordered phase (being ordered in the dual representation) which is topological. This is consistent with the
observation that for J < h the boundary zero modes of neighboring regions will combine and form local, free
S=1/2 degrees of freedom.

IV. CONSERVED, FREE SPIN OPERATOR

As was discussed in the preceding section, in a Quantum Ising model the presence of a classical impurity
with vanishing transverse ﬁeld leads to an exact degeneracy of the entire spectrum, all eigenstates coming
in pairs of equal energy, |En,±i, where ± indicates the eigenvalue of σx
0 . Formally one can thus deﬁne a set
of three ”spin operators” Sx,y,z by their action in this basis:

Sz|En,±i = |En,∓i,
Sy|En,±i = ∓i|En,∓i,
Sx|En,±i = ±|En,±i.

(11)
(12)
(13)

They all commute with the Hamiltonian and satisfy the standard SU(2) commutation relations. These
operators thus represent a free spin 1/2 degree of freedom. Note however, that these latter properties do not
uniquely determine the operators Sx,y,z. Indeed, we could have chosen the labelling of eigenstates such that
± refers instead to the eigenvalue of τnσx
0 with τn being a random sign (±1), chosen independently for each
n. The same construction then yields a diﬀerent triplet of free spin operators. However, almost all of these
choices would result in highly non-local operators, which have no practical interest. The above choice (11)
with τn ≡ 1 is singled out by the further requirement that the resulting operators be local in the ordered
phase of the QIC.

It is not diﬃcult to construct the operators Sx,y,z explicitly using the Majorana zero modes on either side
of the impurity. In terms of the notation introduced in Eq. (28) (see the next section), those zero modes
have the explicit expressions

(18)

one obtains a third conserved operator. It completes the triple of SU(2) operators which satisﬁes the spin
algebra {Si, Sj} = 2δij and [Si, Sj] = 2iǫijkSk. The presence of this quasi-local free spin operator in the
disordered phase implies not only the Curie form of the local susceptibility, but the two-fold degeneracy of
the entire spectrum. Furthermore, to obtain the partner state of a given eigenstate which is simultaneously
an eigenstate of σx
0 , it suﬃces to act with Sz or Sy on that state. This establishes a speciﬁc local relationship
between all many-body states, throughout the entire spectrum. Below we will use this property to estimate
the local transverse susceptibility in the disordered phase, but close to criticality.

A. The existence of conserved quasi-local spin operators is tied to integrability

It is natural to ask whether the existence of a quasi-local, conserved S = 1/2 spin operator is already
implied by the mere presence of a classical impurity in the QIC model. In any Ising model such an impurity
always implies the two-fold degeneracy of the entire spectrum and, by the abstract construction above, the
existence of some conserved operators Sx,y,z which obey SU(2) commutation relations. However, we believe
that these operators are generically non-local, except in models with strong disorder or with an integrable
structure (as for the QIC). Indeed, consider the perturbative construction of the operator Sz according to
the following formal recipe. Consider the general Ising model,

H = −Xi

hiσz

i −Xi,j

Jij σx

i σx

j ≡ H0 + H1,

(19)

with the transverse ﬁeld term being described by H0 ∼ h and the exchange term by H1 ∼ J ≪ h. The
couplings Jij are non-zero only for spins i and j that are spatially close, but not necessarily restricted to
nearest neighbor pairs. Now make the perturbative ansatz

Sz ≡ Sz,(0) + Sz,(1) +Xk≥2

Sz,(k) = σz

0 −Xi

J0i
hi

σy
0 σy

i + O((J/h)2),

(20)

where the norm of the operator Sz,(k) scales as (J/h)k, as J → 0. We may now try to ﬁnd the Sz,(k)
iteratively by solving the conservation constraint [H, Sz] = 0 order by order:

[H0, Sz,(k)] + [H1, Sz,(k−1)] = 0.

(21)

This recipe has been followed in the context of many-body localized systems to construct quasi-local
integrals of motion16. It has been argued that for suﬃciently strong disorder (Var(hi) ≫ J 2, where J is
the typical nearest neighbor exchange coupling), the formal perturbation series deﬁned by Eq. (21) can be
resummed and leads to quasi-local integrals of motion. In this strongly disordered case, the construction
actually works irrespectively of the value of h0). The existence of such quasi-local conserved operators was
proven almost rigorously for one-dimensional Ising spin chains.15

However, for this procedure to work, it is essential that sums and diﬀerences of sets of diﬀerent hi do not
vanish, and that they yield small values only with suﬃciently low probability, since such terms appear in

10

the denominators of the coeﬃcients that multiply products of spin operators in Sz,(k). In a homogeneous
system, where all hi are equal (except for h0 = 0), this requirement is maximally violated, and the above
procedure is very likely to fail. In fact, one faces an extreme case of a small denominator problem, since
many denominators of the formal perturbation theory will exactly vanish as hi → h = const.. This problem
arises because the conjugation with H0, C(X) = [H0, X] is not surjective as a linear map in operator space.
For the case of generically disordered hi its kernel is however small enough, such that one can prove that a
solution to (21) can be found at every step.16

However, for hi = const, the kernel of C is much larger, so that after a few steps of perturbation theory
one cannot ensure that [H1, Sz,(k−1)] lies in the image of C. This issue appears at the earliest in the 4th
order of perturbation theory, if triangles formed by exchange bonds are present. At this point, one would
have to track back and seek for conserved operators using degenerate perturbation theory, remembering that
the exponentially large set of all polynomials in σz
i ’s is conserved by H0. They are thus all zero-eigenvectors
under conjugation with H0 and therefore, in general, perturbation theory has to be carried out starting from
an appropriate linear combination of those degenerate eigen-operators. In view of the non-local nature of
most of those polynomials, it seems very unlikely that such a procedure can be engineered to result in a local
conserved operator Sz.

Also from physical considerations there are good reasons not to expect the existence of such a local
conserved operator in general. A converging, quasi-local Sz could be viewed as the creation operator of a
sharp, quasi-local excitation with zero energy, that is, an exact zero-energy quasiparticle with inﬁnite life
time. In a non-integrable, non-localized system it is not conceivable that such inﬁnitely long-lived excitations
should exist. Indeed, at any ﬁnite temperature there is a ﬁnite phase space for the decay of that quasiparticle,
upon scattering from excited delocalized modes above the spectral gap. Of course, the cross-section of these
processes decreases exponentially to zero as T → 0. This ensures that ultimately, at T = 0, there will still
be a sharp excitation localized close to the impurity, and this will still give rise to a Curie susceptibility in
the low T limit.

However, for classical impurities in very special, non-disordered Ising models such as a chain with only
nearest neighbor interactions, the above-discussed problem of perturbation theory does not arise because of a
lot of exact cancellations that kill the dangerous terms. A non-trivial example is given below. The existence
of such local operators in these systems is presumably tightly linked to the integrability of the transverse
ﬁeld Ising model in strictly 1d systems. Related issues in more complex, but integrable spin chains have
recently been analyzed in Ref. 17.

Local conserved operators Sz appear to exist only in ﬁne-tuned systems, unless one considers strongly
disordered, many-body localized systems. Nevertheless, having the explicit form of conserved Sz in such
ﬁne-tuned systems helps us to visualize the physical properties associated with a classical impurity, especially
at low T . Furthermore, we expect those properties to be more general than the existence of the local Sz
operator itself. Since Sz takes one ground state to another, the spatial extent of the operator makes precise
the notion that the ground states diﬀer only locally, a fact that should be generically true, independent of
integrability or localization. Below, the structure of Sz will also help us to understand the scaling of the low
T susceptibility upon approaching criticality. The fact that in speciﬁc models Sz as an operator is quasi-local
implies additionally that all degenerate pairs of states are similar up to local modiﬁcations, not only the
ground state.

B. Exact conserved spin operators in junctions of transverse ﬁeld Ising chains

It is interesting to note that conserved free spin operators also exist in the case where the classical impurity
sits at the junction of an arbitrary number n of 1d chains - a situation in which integrability is not as obvious
as in the cases of an impurity at the end or in the bulk of a simple chains, which correspond to n = 1, 2.
Labelling the junction spin by 0, one can check that the operator

is indeed conserved by the Ising Hamiltonian on such a junction structure if h0 = 0. This expression
generalizes Eq. (16), to which it reduces for n = 2. This operator also squares to 1. Again one obtains a full
triplet of spin operators by completing Sz with the conserved operators Sx = σx

0 and Sy = iSxSz.

In the low temperature limit, the Lehmann representation of the local spin susceptibility χ0 =

Assuming that the matrix elements of higher spin operator products come with random signs, one ﬁnds that
they contribute with the same scaling to µeﬀ . Close to criticality, in the continuum limit, one thus expects
the scaling

This conjecture is conﬁrmed by the explicit calculations for the cases n = 1 and n = 2, see Eqs. (74) and

IMPURITY IN A WEAKLY NON-CRITICAL QIC

A. Reduction to a two-channel resonant-level model of massive Majorana fermions

In the rest of this paper we will be dealing with a single impurity in a weakly non-critical QIC. In this
section we set up a formalism based on a continuum, ﬁeld-theoretical description of the bulk degrees of
freedom to treat eﬀects caused by the impurity spin. The impurity is located at the origin. The right and
left parts of the chain, supplied with subscripts 1 and 2, respectively, are assumed to be homogeneous, but
may represent diﬀerent quantum Ising chains characterized by two sets of parameters, (J1, h1) and (J2, h2).
In the KM representation, the Hamiltonian of the system reads:

H = −ih0β1β2 + i ˜J1β1c1 + i ˜J2c−2β2

+ iJ1(c2c3 + c4c5 + ··· ) + ih1(c1c2 + c3c4 + ··· )
+ iJ2(c−4c−3 + c−6c−5 + ··· ) + ih2(c−3c−2 + c−5c−4 + ··· )

(27)

The pair of Majorana operators, β1 and β2 (previously denoted c0 and c−1, respectively) describes the
impurity spin σz
0 = iβ1β2 located at the origin. h0 is the transverse magnetic ﬁeld at the impurity site which
must be kept small but ﬁnite to calculate the local response function. The coupling constants ˜J1 and ˜J2
parametrize hybridization between the impurity Majorana fermions and the bulk degrees of freedom.

Before passing to the continuum limit, it is convenient to distinguish between even and odd sites of the KM
(1 ≤ j ≤ N ) with a minor modiﬁcation

lattice. For the right part of the chain we set c2j−1 = ζj , c2j = ηj
for the left part, c2j−1 = ηj , c2j = −ζj (−N ≤ j ≤ −1). In the new notations the Hamiltonian reads

H = −ih0β1β2 + i ˜J1β1ζ1 + i ˜J2β2ζ−1 + iXj≥1

(h1ζiηj + J1ηjζj+1) − iXj≥1

(h2η−j ζ−j + J2ζ−j−1η−j) .

Mapping the negative semi-axis to the positive one, as shown in Fig. 5, and introducing two species of
Majorana operators, ηj ≡ η1j , ζj ≡ ζ1j, η−j ≡ η2j, ζ−j ≡ ζ2j, we transform the Hamiltonian as follows

H = −ih0β1β2 + i Xa=1,2

FIG. 5: Folded KM chain with an impurity.

The last term in (28) represents a sum of two semi-inﬁnite QIC models. Assuming that each chain is close
to criticality, |ha − Ja| ≪ Ja (a = 1, 2), one can pass from the lattice Majorana operators to continuum ﬁelds
using the correspondence

(29)

(30)

(31)

The ﬁelds satisfy the algebra

ηaj → √2a0 ηa(x),

ζaj → √2a0 ζa(x).

{ηa(x), ηb(x′)} = {ζa(x), ζb(x′)} = δabδ(x − x′),

In the continuum limit, the Hamiltonian (28) takes the form

{ηa(x), ζb(x′)} = 0.

H = −ih0β1β2 + i√2a0 Xa=1,2

˜Jaβaζa(0) + Xa=1,2Z L

dx [ivaηa(x)∂xζa(x) − imaηa(x)ζa(x)] .

In (31) the bulk degrees of freedom of the system are described in terms of two (formally Lorentz-invariant)
free massive Majorana ﬁelds with group velocities va = 2Jaa0 and masses ma = 2(ha − Ja).

In the continuum limit, the Majorana ﬁelds at the open end must satisfy boundary conditions which are
obtained as follows. Take a semi-inﬁnite KM lattice (ζ1, η1), (ζ2, η2), . . . and add an extra site j = 0 requiring
that the pairing between η0 and ζ1 is absent. For the degrees of freedom on the chains this is equivalent
to having a ﬁnite coupling, but imposing the constraint η0 = 0. Thus, in the continuum description, which
captures the relevant low-energy subspace of the model, the boundary conditions are

ηa(0) = 0,

(a = 1, 2).

(32)

The original model is thus equivalently represented as a Majorana version of the two-channel, massive
resonant-level model on a semi-inﬁnite (for N → ∞) axis with an impurity at the boundary. It is crucial
that diﬀerent bulk channels (a = 1, 2) are coupled to diﬀerent Majorana components of the impurity spin
(β1 and β2). Note that if h0 = 0 the channels decouple.

The massless limit of the model (31) has been thoroughly studied long ago in the context of the overscreened
Kondo eﬀect. Indeed, at m1 = m2 = 0 and v1 = v2, Eq. (31) represents the Majorana resonant-level model
introduced and solved by Emery and Kivelson10 in their bosonization treatment of the two-channel Kondo
problem with XXZ exchange anisotropy (see e.g. Ref. 18 for a review). The correspondence between the
critical point of the model (31) and the two-channel resonant-level model is brieﬂy discussed in Appendix A.
When one of the two bulk-impurity couplings, ˜J1 or ˜J2, vanishes, one has a problem of massive Majorana
fermions on a single semi-inﬁnite chain with an impurity at the open end. In the related two-channel Kondo
model, this case corresponds to the channel-symmetric situation describing the overscreened Kondo eﬀect.
For two identical massless chains and coinciding coupling constants ( ˜J1 = ˜J2) the Hamiltonian (31) acquires
an enhanced, O(2), symmetry associated with global planar rotations of the ﬁrst and second Majorana
species. In this case the Hamiltonian (31) represents the usual resonant-level model for complex fermions, in
which the total particle number is conserved and which is relevant to the single-channel Kondo problem19.
At m1 = m2 6= 0, v1 = v2 the model (31) describes a semi-inﬁnite Peierls insulator (PI) cahin with an

impurity fermionic d-state at the open boundary whose energy is εd = −2h0 (see Appendix D).

B. Diagonalized bulk spectrum and the total Hamiltonian

To diagonalize the bulk part of the Hamiltonian (31), one ﬁrst performs a chiral rotation of the Majorana

ﬁelds (ηa, ζa):

13

ηa(x) =

ξaR(x) + ξaL(x)

√2

,

ζa(x) = −ξaR(x) + ξaL(x)

√2

.

The new Majorana ﬁelds satisfy the algebra:

{ξaR(x), ξbR(x′)} = {ξaL(x), ξbL(x′)} = δabδ(x − x′),

{ξaR(x), ξbL(x′)} = 0.

The boundary conditions (32) translate to

ξaR(0) = −ξaL(0).
In terms of the ﬁelds ξa;R,L(x) the Hamiltonian takes the form

˜JaβaξaR(0)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

The diagonalization of a massive Majorana model on a semi-axis is discussed in Appendix B. The spectrum
contains a continuum of extended states with the energy εk = √k2v2 + m2 and, for a negative mass only
(m < 0), a normalizable zero-energy state localized at the boundary of the chain within a characteristic
length ξ = a0/| ln(h/J)| ≃ a0/(1− h/J) = v/|m|. The normal-mode expansion of a single massive Majorana
spinor ﬁeld operator is given by formula (B14). Using this expansion one rewrites the Hamiltonian as follows:

H = −ih0β1β2 +Xk>0Xa

Here γk, γ†k are fermionic quasiparticle operators related to the continuum part of the spectrum, γ0 = γ†0 is
the operator describing the boundary MZM, and

λa

are the coupling constants. In the last term of (37) the local Majorana operators βa couple to a Hermitian
combination of the band operators, γak +γ†ak. Therefore we can ”majoranize” the bulk part of the spectrum as
well. Represent the quasiparticle operator γ†k as a linear combination of two real operators: γ†k = (bk +ifk)/2.
The algebra {γk, γ†k′} = δkk′ implies that {bk, bk′} = {fk, fk′} = 2δkk′ with all remaining anticommutators
vanishing. The kinetic energy becomes

εkγ†kγk = −

(39)

As we shall show below, the coupling of the impurity Majorana operators βa to the Majorana boundary MZM
operators γa0, parametrized by the constants λa
0, plays a crucial role in the low-temperature asymptotics of
the local spin susceptibility in the ordered bulk phase.

C. Physical quantities in terms of Green’s functions

The Hamiltonian HM in (39) represents a one-particle, exactly solvable model. Our goal is to calculate the
impurity parts of the physical quantities: the spectral weight of the impurity spin, the local magnetization
and spin susceptibility deﬁned as the linear response to the local transverse magnetic ﬁeld. All calculations
are straightforward and can be done using the formalism of Matsubara Green’s functions (GF)20.

14

Here we provide basic deﬁnitions. We remind that the impurity spin is described in terms of two Majorana

A local magnetic ﬁeld h0 determines the Zeeman energy of the impurity spin, H0 = −h0σz
local magnetization and spin susceptibility are deﬁned as

χ0(T ) =

(42)

∂m0

∂h0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h0=0

In the context of a 1DPS, the local magnetization of the impurity in a QIC translates to the average
occupation number of the d-fermionic state, m0 → 2(hndi − 1/2), the magnetic ﬁeld h0 transforms to the
local energy of the d-fermion, µ0 = 2h0, and the local spin susceptibility χ0 becomes the local charge
susceptibility (”compressibility”) of the impurity site.

An important characteristics of free fermionic models which determines local thermodynamic properties

of the impurity is the spectral weight (or local density of states) of the boundary complex fermion:

A(ω) = −

dτ eiεnτ G(τ ), G(τ ) = −hTτ d(τ )d†i,

εn = (2n + 1)πT

where Tτ is the imaginary-time ordering operator and d(τ ) = eτ Hde−τ H. Using the integral representation
for G(εn)

G(εn) =Z ∞

(46)

where f (ω) = (eω/T + 1)−1 is the Fermi distribution function.

Thus, the spectral weight determines the local magnetization m0 and average occupation hndi of the
impurity site, both being experimentally accessible quantities. However, when describing the impurity spin
dynamics in terms of the local d-fermion, one should pay attention to the important diﬀerence between the
cases of a boundary impurity in a semi-inﬁnite QIC and an impurity in the bulk of the spin chain. In the
former case, the impurity spin is located at the open end of the chain, so the boundary spin operators σ±0

15

do not contain the JW exponentials and are locally expressed in terms of d and d†: σ+
this case the d-fermion Green’s function Gd(τ ) coincides with the spin-spin correlation function,

0 = 2d†, σ−0 = 2d. In

Gd(τ ) = −

1
4hσ−0 (τ )σ+

0 (0)i,

(47)

and the spectral function A(ω) measures the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the impurity spin.

This is not so for an impurity coupled to both Ising chains, ˜J1, ˜J2 6= 0. In this case, only the total fermion
number parity PS = exp[iπ(N1 + N2)] is conserved , while the parities of each chain, P1,2, are not. Therefore,
in the deﬁnition (40), the JW ”tail” operator P2 = exp(iπN2) has a nontrivial dynamics, implying that for an
impurity in the bulk of the QIC, the impurity spin components σ±0 are essentially nonlocal objects in terms
of the JW fermions. In this case A(ω) cannot be expressed in terms of simple local spin-spin correlators and
thus only has the meaning of a density of states for the d-fermion.

At h0 = 0 the Hamiltonian (39) has an exact sub-chain symmetry: it remains invariant under the trans-

formations

β1 → −β1, γ10 → −γ10, b1k → −b1k, f1k → −f1k,
β2 → β2, γ20 → γ20, b2k → b2k, f2k → f2k.

(48)

In particular, the transformation (48) swaps d ↔ d†, implying that at h0 = 0 G(εn) = −G(−εn) and,
according to (45), A(ω; 0) = A(−ω; 0). Therefore at any ﬁnite temperature m0 → 0 as h0 → 0. However, the
limit h0 → 0 does in general not commute with the limit T → 0, in which tanh(ω/2T ) acquires a discontinuity
at ω = 0. The result of the integration in (46) thus becomes ambiguous if A(ω) has a δ-function singularity
at ω = 0. This singularity reﬂects the two-fold degeneracy of the impurity ground state. The local zero-
temperature magnetization will exhibit a discontinuity as h0, and with it the δ-function singularity of A(ω),
cross zero. A free spin 1/2 is a simple example of this kind: when the external magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ,
the magnetization m0(h0) = sgn(h0) keeps track of its original orientation. Switching on a ﬁnite magnetic
ﬁeld h0 generates an antisymmetric part of the spectral weight which yields a nonzero contribution to the
integral (46). The spin susceptibility can then be obtained using the deﬁnition (42). Formula (46) for m0
will be used extensively below.

The zero-ﬁeld local susceptibility χ0(T ) = [∂m0/∂h0]h0=0 has an equivalent representation in terms of the

(50)

In the model (39), at h0 = 0 the Majorana ﬁelds β1 and β2 are decoupled, and in (50) one should set D12 =
D21 = 0. The representation (50) will prove useful in the next section when we analyze the susceptibility
close to criticality.

VI. BOUNDARY IMPURITY IN A SEMI-INFINITE QUANTUM ISING CHAIN

In the remainder of this paper we primarily deal with a situation displaying rich physics at the boundary:
the model of a single non-critical semi-inﬁnite QIC with an impurity spin at the open end. It is obtained
from the Hamiltonian (27) by cutting oﬀ the coupling of the impurity Majorana fermion β2 to the second
channel ( ˜J2 = 0). We will ﬁrst gain some intuition about the MZMs in the two phases in the discrete version
of this model and then turn to a continuum desciption assuming that massive phases of the semi-inﬁnite
QIC are only weakly non-critical.

A qualitative picture of the MZMs can be inferred from Fig. 5 where the lower KM chain should be
completely ignored. Set h0 = 0, ˜J1 6= 0 and consider the limiting cases J/h → 0 and h/J → 0. In the former
case, the impurity degrees of freedom are represented by two MZMs: one being the decoupled Majorana
fermion β2 and the other contained in the spectrum of the 3-site complex, H3 = i ˜J1β1c1 + ihc1c2. Therefore
in the disordered phase (J > h 6= 0) there are two zero-energy bound states attached to the boundary: one
of them localized just at the impurity site while the other one has a ﬁnite penetration into the bulk. The
two MZMs describe a well-deﬁned local spin degree of freedom.

In the ordered phase, there remains only one MZM (β2) localized exactly at the boundary. The second
impurity Majorana (β1) couples with a nonzero binding energy to the bulk fermion c1, which, in the impurity-
bulk decoupling limit ( ˜J1 = 0), represents the boundary MZM of an isolated QIC in its ordered phase5. In
this phase no local spin 1/2 remains at the impurity site. As we will see in what follows, the bound state
between the impurity Majorana fermion and the boundary zero mode of the bulk plays a crucial role in
quenching the transverse susceptibility of the impurity spin in the topological (ordered) phase of the QIC.

A. Spectral weight of the impurity spin

Now we turn to a continuum model describing a semi-inﬁnite, weakly non-critical QIC with an impurity
spin at the open end. Such a model is obtained from (39) by removing the coupling of the Majorana fermion
β2 to the second channel (λ20 = λ2k = 0):

Here λ0 = λ10, λk = λ1k, bk = b1k, fk = f1k. The GF G(εn) is calculated in Appendix C:

This yields the following expressions for the retarded GF at high and low frequencies:

Separating the imaginary parts of the GFs (54) and (55) we ﬁnd that, at h0 = 0, for a non-critical semi-inﬁnite
QIC the impurity spectral weight has the following form:

(56)

Here the δ-function term is the contribution of the impurity Majorana fermion β2, which is completely
decoupled at h0 = 0. On the other hand, Af (ω) alone represents the impurity spectral weight for two
identical QICs symmetrically coupled to the impurity, in which case the model maps onto the standard
massive semi-inﬁnite resonant-level model. In particular, such a model emerges in a continuum description
of a 1D spinless Peierls insulator which also possesses topological and trivial massive phases21 (see Appendix
D). The explicit expressions for the impurity spectral weight Af (ω) at h0 = 0 are:

Below we split the susceptibility into contributions from the discrete δ-functions, χ<, and from the continuum
(ω2 > m2) above the gap, χ>, respectively,

χ0 = χ< + χ>.

(61)

For a critical Majorana resonant level model (the case m = 0) the additive structure of the spectral weight
A(ω) given by the sum (56) was ﬁrst obtained by Emery and Kivelson10. As we see, the immunity of the
decoupled Majorana fermion β2 keeps the structure (56) valid in the massive case as well. It shows that only
one half of the boundary spin degrees of freedom is hybridized with the gapless bulk excitations while the
other half is decoupled from the rest of the system.

The representation (56) is no longer valid at h0 6= 0. The spectral weight at a small nonzero h0 will be

discussed separately in the sequel.

B. Local magnetization and spin susceptibility

1. Critical state, m = 0

At m = 0 the Hamiltonian (51) coincides with the resonant-level model introduced and solved by Emery
and Kivelson10 in their treatment of the two-channel Kondo problem. For the sake of completeness and later
comparison with massive cases, we reproduce their main ﬁndings here.

The spectral weight of the d-fermion is given by formula (56). Setting m = 0 in Eq. (57) or (58) one

obtains10 (h0 = 0)

(62)

The zero-temperature entropy of the impurity spin, S = (1/2) ln 2, is a half of its value for an isolated spin
1/2. This is a direct eﬀect of the decoupled boundary Majorana β2-fermion. Applying a small local magnetic

ﬁeld h0 induces an antisymmetric part of A(ω) which can be easily obtained from (54). According to the
deﬁnition (46), this leads to the following result for the zero-ﬁeld local susceptibility

At T ≫ Γ the susceptibility follows the Curie law, χ0 = 1/T, as expected. In contrast, at low temperatures,
T ≪ Γ, it has a logarithmic temperature dependence typical for the two-channel, overscreened Kondo
impurity in the channel-symmetric case10:

χ0(T ) =

(64)

It is instructive to make a comparison with the case of two (instead of one) identical critical Majorana
chains coupled to the boundary spin. This reduces to the standard resonant-level model describing a semi-
inﬁnite metallic chain with a d-fermion state at its boundary. Such a model with two attached critical Ising
chains maps identically to a U(1)-symmetric spin-1/2, semi-inﬁnite XX chain with a boundary spin 1/2
in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld h0. This model is known to be related to the standard, one-channel Kondo
problem at the Toulouse point (see e.g. Ref. 18). In this case the impurity spectral weight and the local
charge susceptibility at T /Γ → 0,

χ =

describe a local ”Fermi-liquid” regime at the boundary. The impurity spin is totally screened and its ground
state is non-degenerate: at T = 0 the local boundary magnetization smoothly vanishes as h0 → 0.

As follows from the Emery-Kivelson solution, the logarithmic divergence of the local susceptibility (64)
is weaker than the Curie law. This is a signature of non-Fermi-liquid character of the local response. The
logarithimic asymptotics of the boundary susceptibility (64) are the hallmark of Majorana physics at the
edge of a single chain. As discussed below, these asymptotics hold in the massive case as well when the
quantun critical regime |m| ≪ T ≪ Γ is considered.

2. Disordered phase, m > 0

As we already know, there are two boundary MZMs in the disordered phase. One of them (β2) is completely
decoupled whereas the other Majorana mode (β1) hybridizes with the bulk degrees of freedom. The behavior
of the thermodynamic quantities at the edge in various temperature regimes will depend on the ratio m/Γ,
or equivalently, on the relation between two length scales – the correlation length ξm ∼ v/m and the
hybridization length ξΓ ∼ v/Γ. At ξm ≪ ξΓ (m ≫ Γ) both boundary MZMs are well localized, and one
expects a Curie law for the local susceptibility, χ0 = C/T , with a slightly reduced Curie constant (C . 1).
In the other limit, ξm ≫ ξΓ (m ≪ Γ), hybridization eﬀects are dominant. If m ≪ T ≪ Γ, the mass gap
can be ignored and the logarightmic regime (64) is seen. However, upon further decreasing the temperature,
T ≪ m ≪ Γ, a low-T Curie behavior of the impurity reappears, albeit with a strongly reduced Curie
constant.

With this qualitative picture in mind, let us now turn to the spectral weight at m > 0 given by Eq. (57).
At h0 = 0, its evolution on decreasing the mass m is shown in Fig. 6. The low-frequency part of A(ω)
contains a δ-function singularity

Asing(ω) = A0δ(ω),

A0 =

(1 + Z) =

where Z is given by (59). Its amplitude A0 interpolates between the free-spin value A0 = 1 in the strong
localization limit (Γ/m → 0) and the ”two-channel Kondo” value A0 = 1/2 (see Eq. (62)) in the strong
hybridization limit (Γ/m → ∞). To calculate m(h0, T ) at h0 → 0 we need to know the low-frequency part
of A(ω; h0) at a small nonzero h0. Using (55) at |ω|, h0 ≪ m we obtain

FIG. 6: Evolution of the spectral weight in the disordered phase (m > 0) upon decreasing m. The lowest plot corresponds
to m = 0, where the continuum shoulders tend to ω → 0. In this case the continuum spectral function is to be understood as
contributing only to the principal part when appearing in an integral, on top of which there is still a δ-function contribution
from ω = 0.

The high-frequency part of the spectral weight features a broad continuum of states at ω2 > m2 with a

non-singular behavior at the thresholds ω = ±m: A(ω) ∼ √ω ∓ m. To estimate the contribution of this
frequency region to the boundary spin susceptibility we proceed from the expression (54) for G>(ω), ﬁnd in
the leading order in h0 the antisymmetric part of the spectral weight and, using formula (46), obtain the
high-frequency contribution to the local susceptibility:

In the regime m ≫ Γ when the impurity spin is strongly localized, the high-frequency part of the impurity
spectral weight gives only a small correction compared to the contribution of the already considered low-
frequency part, χ<(T ), the relative correction being of the order of T Γ/m2 for T ≪ m, or of order Γ/m for
T ≫ m ≫ Γ.

The situation changes in the strong hybridization limit, m ≪ Γ. As the ratio m/Γ tends to zero, the
eﬀective magnetic moment µeﬀ vanishes and, at the same time, the high-frequency contribution to the local
susceptibility, Eq. (70), logarithmically diverges. This means that at m ≪ Γ this contribution becomes
dominant if T > m. Indeed, replacing Ω1 by Γ in (69) we obtain:

where {a, b} ≡ max(a, b). We see that at m ≪ Γ ≪ T , the Curie-law behavior of the local susceptibility
is contributed by the incoherent, high-energy continuum of states. At lower temperatures, T, m ≪ Γ, χ>
follows the logarithmic two-channel-Kondo asymptotics10, so that the total local susceptibility is given by

(73)

(74)

The high-temperature and low-temperature Curie behaviors of χ0 ”sandwich” the intermediate-temperature
(m ≪ T ≪ Γ) logarithmic asymptotics (64).

Thus, at any ﬁnite m > 0 (i.e. Z 6= 0) there exists a well deﬁned spin-1/2 degree of freedom localized at
the open boundary of the chain and characterized by the eﬀective magnetic moment µeﬀ which depends on
the ratio m/Γ. The eﬀective moment takes the value µeﬀ = 1 at Γ/m → 0 and decreases upon increasing
the ratio Γ/m, vanishing at criticality (m = 0).
In the strong localization limit, m ≫ Γ, the Curie law
χ0 ≃ 1/T is valid at any temperature. Delocalization of the impurity fermion β1 across the whole chain
in the critical state of the system is concomitant with the disappearance of the boundary spin-1/2 degree
of freedom (µeﬀ → 0 as m → 0). This is consistent with the emerging non-Curie, logarithmic temperature
dependence of the local susceptibility, Eq. (72). Exactly at criticality (m = 0), the local magnetization at
T = 0 is a non-analytic function of h0

10: m(h0) = (8h0/πΓ) ln(Γ/h0).

3. Eﬀective moment of the Curie law: a probe of similarity of degenerate ground states

It is useful to look at the eﬀective magnetic moment µeﬀ from a diﬀerent perspective, using a Lehmann
representation as in Eq. (24), where µeﬀ was expressed as the matrix element of the operator σz
0 between the
two degenerate ground states. A renormalized but ﬁnite local free-spin susceptibility (23) in the disordered
phase reﬂects the fact that the two ground states only diﬀer locally, that is, in a ﬁnite number of degrees
of freedom. This shows that in this phase the origin of the exact spectral degeneracy is purely local, and
accordingly, cannot be seen in measurements which only probe degrees of freedom far from the impurity.
The vanishing of µeﬀ upon tuning to the critical point and in the ordered phase can be interpreted as an
emerging orthogonality between the ground states for h0 = 0±. It is this orthogonality at the degeneracy
point h0 = 0, which protects the susceptibility from diverging in the ordered (topological) phase.

To put this result into a more general context, it is useful to switch to the eigenbasis, in which the parity
operator PS has a deﬁnite eigenvalue. Since PS commutes with H irrespective of the value of the transverse
ﬁeld h0, this basis is better adapted to discuss the crossing of the degeneracy point h0 = 0. In the QIC
model it is easy to prove that the ground states associated with transverse ﬁelds h0 and −h0 have opposite

21

parity. This follows immediately from the fact that conjugation with σx
0 ) ﬂips
both the sign of h0 and the parity operator. This implies that at h0 = 0 the ground state is degenerate and
that its parity ﬂips, as h0 is tuned across 0.

0 , PS → σx

0 (H → σx

0 PSσx

0 Hσx

Let us now analyze a generic system in which the ground state is tuned to a point where it becomes doubly
degenerate or has exponentially small level splitting δ, while the remaining states are separated by a ﬁnite
gap ∆. Let the two-dimensional ground state manifold be spanned by the orthogonal eigenstates |αi and
|βi. At temperatures δ ≪ T ≪ ∆, the density matrix is simply proportional to unity in this subspace,

ρ = |αihα| + |βihβ|

The susceptibility of an observable A, deﬁned as the linear response to its conjugate ﬁeld, is easily calculated

0. If |αi,|βi are chosen to be the eigenstates |+i,|−i of σx

In the quantum Ising model, the degeneracy occurs at h0 = 0 and the local transverse susceptibility
corresponds to the operator A = σz
0 , then only the
oﬀ-diagonal elements are nonzero, and one recovers Eq. (24) for µeﬀ . Choosing instead the parity eigenbasis,
|PS = ±1i = 1√2
(|+i±|−i), only the diagonal elements can be nonzero by symmetry. As follows from (77), in
the disordered phase µeﬀ can assume any value ≤ 1. However, anywhere in the ordered phase, µeﬀ becomes
exponentially small in the system size, because of spontaneous symmetry breaking: The parity-even and -odd
ground states are equal weight superpositions of the symmetry breaking ground states |±i (magnetization
aligned or anti-aligned with x), with equal or opposite signs, respectively. This implies equality of the
diagonal matrix elements in the parity basis, up to an exponentially small diﬀerence given by the matrix
element h−|σz

0|+i, which connects the two symmetry breaking sectors.

After the JW transformation, the symmetry-related degeneracy translates into the topological degeneracy
of the Majorana Hamiltonian, with parity-even and -odd sectors being degenerate up to exponentially small
perturbations. The latter feature is generic in topological phases, and essentially constitutes their deﬁning
property - topological protection: The action of any local observables, such as A, restricted to the topologi-
cally degenerate manifold is that of a unit operator, up to corrections which are exponentially small in the
system size. From this and formula (77) it follows immediately that the Curie weight µ2
eﬀ is exponentially
suppressed in a topological phase. This is the case even at exact degeneracy points, where the parity of the
ground state switches (as happens, e.g., for h0 = 0 in the fermionic version of the QIC in its ferromagnetic
phase). We will see in Sec. VIII below a non-trivial example of a 1d p-wave superconductor, where the
suppression of a Curie-like divergence of the low temperature charge susceptibility is found everywhere in
the topological phase, independent of the ﬁne-tuning of the local potential µ0 acting on an impurity site. As
we will argue, the only generic exact ground state degeneracy occurs when the ground state switches parity
within the topologically degenerate manifold. To bring about further degeneracies within the same parity
sector requires a high degree of ﬁne-tuning. Such degeneracies will thus generically not be encountered upon
moving along a single parameter family of Hamiltonians, such as varying a local potential or ﬁeld.

4. Ordered phase, m < 0

The physical picture emerging in the ordered phase (m < 0) is qualitatively diﬀerent from the disordered
phase. As follows from (56), the completely decoupled MZM β2 gives a contribution (1/2)δ(ω) to the spectral

22

weight which remains intact upon varying the ratio |m|/Γ and is immune against application of external
ﬁelds. The transformation of the incoherent high-frequency background on increasing the mass gap |m| is
shown in Fig. 7. As long as |m| < Γ, the behavior of A(ω) is qualitatively the same as in the disordered phase.
At |m| = Γ the spectral weight acquires new features. Precisely at this point the thresholds at ω = ±|m|
transform from non-singular to singular: A(ω) ∼ 1/pω ∓ |m|. This feature comes together with the ”birth”
of a particle in the spectrum: at |m| = Γ + 0 two symmetric δ-function peaks, δ(ω ∓ ω0), emerge just below
the thresholds. They belong to new levels with energies inside the gap, which split from the incoherent
continuum of states. They are mainly due to the hybridization between two zero modes – the impurity
β1-Majorana fermion and the zero mode γ0, which is present in the spectrum of the Dirac Hamiltonian
at m < 0. These discrete sub-gap states exist provided that the localization of γ0 is strong enough (the
condition |m| > Γ). The eﬀective Hamiltonian describing this splitting in the limit |m| ≫ Γ simply coincides
with the λ0-mixing term in the model (51): H′ = −iλ0β1γ0, where λ0 ∼pΓ|m| ∼ ω0. Notice that as soon
as |m| > Γ the spectra at the thresholds ω = ±|m| return to a non-singular form.
The main features of the spectral weight A(ω) in the strong localization limit, |m| > Γ, shown schematically
in the last plot of Fig. 7, are in a qualitative agreement with the results of a recent numerical work23, where
the spectrum of a resonant level attached to the edge of a 1D triplet superconductor was calculated. However,
local thermodynamic properties of this system have not been addressed in Ref. 23.

FIG. 7: Evolution of the spectral weight in the ordered phase (m < 0) upon increasing |m|. As the bulk gap |m| crosses Γ, a
pair of discrete subgap states emerges.

Let us determine the eﬀect of these subgap states on the susceptibility of the impurity spin. At h0 ≪ ω0
the positions of the peaks δ(ω ∓ ω0) change only by an amount ∼ O(h2
0), which can be safely neglected. As a
result the antisymmetric part of the low-frequency (ω2 < m2) spectral weight A<(ω) is simply proportional

to ¯µeﬀ = 0 as |m| → Γ + 0. As follows from (79), at lower temperatures, T ≪ ω0, χ<(T ) crosses over to a
constant, temperature independent value

Estimating the eﬀect of the high-frequency spectral function on the susceptibility χ0, we ﬁnd that the

Using (82) one can easily check that at the threshold |m| = Γ where the spectral weight becomes singular,
the local susceptibility remains analytic. Turning to the strong localization regime, |m| ≫ Γ, we ﬁnd that
the T = 0 value of χ> is given by

where we have used the fact that ω0 = p2Γ|m| ≪ |m|. In the same limit χ< is given by (81). Therefore
χ>/χ< ∼ (Γ/|m|)3/2 ≪ 1.
Thus we conclude that in the strong localization limit (|m| ≫ Γ), the dominant contribution to the local

susceptibility χ0 = χ< + χ> comes from its low-frequency part χ<, Eqs. (79)–(81).

The result (81) can be understood as follows. The impurity spin σx

0 couples by an exchange interaction
1 located at the boundary site j = 1 of the semi-inﬁnite QIC: H01 = − ˜Jσx
˜J to the spin σx
In the
ordered phase σx
1 acquires an expectation value, and in the leading order the impurity spin experiences a
local magnetic ﬁeld hx = ˜Jhσx
1i. Adding a local transverse ﬁeld h0 = (0, 0, h0), we write the total energy of
the impurity spin as H01 = −hxσx
0 . In the limit h0 → 0, the transverse spin susceptibility is equal to
χ0 = 1/hx ∼ 1/√Γhσx
1i, where Γ ∼ ˜J 2/v. The crucial point is that the scaling (i.e., the mass dependence)
of the boundary magnetization in a slightly non-critical (ordered) QIC is diﬀerent from that in the bulk22:
hσxibound ∼p|m|. This leads to χ0 ∼ 1/pΓ|m|.
It remains to consider the regime |m| ≪ Γ, which is entirely contributed by the high-frequency part of
the impurity spectral weight. In this regime the role of the mass gap |m| reduces to an infrared cutoﬀ in
the logarithmic temperature dependence of the local susceptibility, and the sign of the mass is completely
unimportant. Therefore, replacing m by |m|, the formulas (71), (72) of the preceding subsection can be used
in this case as well:

To conclude our discussion of a boundary impurity in the topological phase of a wire, let us consider a more
general situation in which the end of the wire is essentially described by an odd number (2N − 1) Majorana
modes, c2,...,2N , with the remaining degrees of freedom being treated as suﬃciently strongly gapped and
therefore irrelevant for the low energy sector. The impurity is again described by two Majoranas, c0 and c1.
The most general quadratic Hamiltonian then takes the form

Ajkcjck,

H = iXjk

(88)

where Ajk is a real, antisymmetric (2N + 1) × (2N + 1) matrix.

Since the number of Majoranas is odd and the spectrum has a particle-hole symmetry, the presence of at
least one exact zero mode is guaranteed. We now show that all other levels are generically repelled from
zero. This is most conveniently seen from the characteristic polynomial of the matrix iA,

piA(E) ≡ det(iA − E) =

ci(A)E1+2i,

N

Xi=1

(89)

25

where only odd powers of the energy variable E appear with coeﬃcients ci(A). In order to ﬁnd a fermionic
level at E = 0 further to the guaranteed Majorana zero mode, the characteristic polynomial must have a
triple zero at E = 0. This requires c1(A) = 0, which can be expressed in terms of the diagonal minors of A,

c1(A) = (−1)N +1

2N

Xi=0

det( ˆAii) = (−1)N +1

2N

Xi=0

[Pf( ˆAii)]2 = 0,

(90)

where ˆAii is the matrix with the i’th row and the i’th column eliminated, and Pf( ˆAii) is its Pfaﬃan. Due to
the antisymmetry of A, the minors det( ˆAii) are squares of Pfaﬃans, which must all vanish simultaneously
for any other level to cross E = 0. It is clear that it requires a high degree of ﬁne-tuning to circumvent
the level repulsion from the guaranteed zero mode. The only obvious way to achieve this is by completely
decoupling one or several sites from the rest and driving a zero-crossing in that decoupled part of the system.
However, a generic variation of local parameters at the impurity or at the end of the chain will not lead to
an extra zero crossing.

5. Qualitative diﬀerence of the boundary response in topologically ordered and disordered phases

As discussed above, the local response of the system to a boundary transverse magnetic ﬁeld is qualitatively
diﬀerent in the topologically disordered and ordered phases: in the disordered phase the response function
χ0(T ) follows a singular Curie asymptotics in the T → 0 limit, whereas in the ordered phase it is ﬁnite.
It is instructive to look again at this qualitative diﬀerence by approaching it from the ”polarization-loop”
representation of χ0(T ), Eq. (50).

Using the explicit form of the Majorana Green’s functions Daa(εn) (a = 1, 2) at h0 = 0 (see Appendix C)

one represents χ0(T ) as a sum over Matsubara frequencies

χ0(T ) = 4T Xεn

(91)

(92)

For an isolated spin (Γ = 0) ∆(ε) = ε2 and the integral in (92) diverges at the lower limit, implying that
the Matsubara sum in (91) cannot be replaced by the integral (92). Doing the Matsubara sum leads to the
standard Curie law:

(93)

In spite of its simplicity, this result is quite noteworthy. It indicates that, for a boundary impurity spin
in a QIC, the response of the system to the local transverse magnetic ﬁeld h0 will follow a singular Curie
behavior

χ0(T → 0) =

C
T

,

0 < C < 1,

(94)

only if ∆(ε) ∼ ε2 as ε → 0. If, on the other hand, ∆(ε) → const 6= 0 as ε → 0, the local boundary response
will be non-singular, and the limit limT→0 χ0(T ) will be ﬁnite. In such a situation, the ground state of the
impurity spin is non-degenerate. The arguments we will give below unambiguously indicate that, irrespective
of the magnitude of the ratio Γ/|m|, the non-singular behavior of χ0(T ) in the limit T → 0 is entirely due
to the presence of the boundary zero Majorana mode in the bulk spectrum of the QIC at m < 0.

The contribution of the boundary MZM can be singled out by representing ∆(εn) as follows:

∆(εn) = ε2

n + Γ(pε2

n + m2 − |m|) + 2Γ|m|θ(−m).

(95)

Consider now the region of small frequences, |εn| ≪ |m| (which automatically implies that T ≪ |m|) in
which case

26

∆(εn) ≃(cid:18)1 +

Γ

2|m|(cid:19) ε2

n + 2Γ|m|θ(−m).

(96)

It then follows from (96) that in the disordered phase (m > 0), when the second term in the r.h.s. of (96)
is absent, ∆(εn) ∼ ε2
n and the susceptibility maintains its singular Curie form (94) with the renormalized
Curie constant:

C = µ2

eﬀ =

2m

Γ + 2m

.

(97)

Obviously, the results of Eqs. (94,97) are contributed by the low-frequency (ω2 < m2) part of the impurity
spectral weight A(ω), while the contribution of the high-frequency continuum (ω2 > m2) represents a
relatively small correction.

On the other hand, in the ordered (topological) phase (m < 0) ∆(εn) → 2Γ|m|

6= 0 as εn → 0. So,
the presence of the boundary MZM in the spectrum at m < 0 is the ultimate reason why the local response
of the topologically ordered phase is non-singular. This reﬂects the fact that, in the thermodynamic limit,
coupling locally to a boundary degree of feedom does not allow to switch the topological sector, or the sector
of spontaneously broken symmetry. Thus the linear response remains non-singular even at points where
there is a spectral degeneracy between the diﬀerent sectors.

However, this argument does not always imply that the ﬁnite value of χ0 in the topologically ordered
phase will be contributed by the region of small ε where the expansion (96) is valid. Such an approximation
is valid in the limit of strong localization, |m| ≫ Γ. The sum over εn will then mostly be contributed by
frequencies |ε| ∼pΓ|m| ≪ |m|. In this case we can approximate ∆(ε) by the expression

∆(ε) ≃(cid:18)1 +

of small frequencies, ε2 ≪ m2. From (98) we have

the mass gap |m| serving as the infrared cutoﬀ of the logarithm. Since within the logarithmic accuracy, a
large logarithm ln(Γ/|m|) is admitted to have a relatively small correction ∼ O(1), in the strong hybridization
limit χ>(0) logarithmically dominates χ<(0). However, the most important fact here is that, contrary to the
situation in the disordered phase, χ<(T = 0) is ﬁnite at m < 0. This is due to the presence of the boundary
MZM, as is clearly seen from formulae (100,101).

Thus, the role of the boundary MZM in the topological phase is clear. Hybridization with the bulk MZM
suppresses the low-frequency part of the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the impurity spin and renders the local
response non-singular, as illustrated in Table. I. Therefore, the non-singular zero-temperature limit of the
local response function χ0 of an impurity at the edge of a chain serves as an indication of the existence of a
boundary Majorana zero mode in the topologically ordered phase.

VII.

IMPURITY IN THE BULK OF A QUANTUM ISING CHAIN

In this section we consider a zero-ﬁeld impurity in the bulk (rather than the edge) of a non-critical QIC.
As we have shown in Sec. V A, this model reduces to a problem of two semi-inﬁnite QICs coupled to the
impurity spin at the boundary. We will assume that the chains a = 1, 2 are identical (v1 = v2, m1 = m2)
but characterized by independent nonzero hybridization constants Γ1 and Γ2. At Γ1 = Γ2 the model is
equivalent to a spinless, semi-inﬁnite Peierls insulator (PI) chain with a boundary fermionic d-level, as we
show in Appendix D. In the PI model, χ0 also describes the local compressibility at the impurity site. The
role of the mass m is played by the diﬀerence between the alternating hopping amplitudes of the Peierls
chain, t± = t ± ∆. For a positive ∆ the ﬁrst two sites next to the impurity form a more strongly coupled
dimer, and the corresponding massive phase of the PI is non-topological. In the opposite case, ∆ < 0, the
ground state of the PI is topologically degenerate and supports boundary zero modes.

We might as well consider an impurity located at a domain wall separating the ordered (x > 0) and
disordered (x < 0) phases of a QIC. For topological reasons, to understand the low-energy sector, we can
formally take the limit m → +∞ at x → −∞. Thus, in the low-energy limit, this case reduces to the already
considered problem of a single semi-inﬁnite QIC in the ordered phase (m < 0) with a boundary impurity.

For a bulk classical spin the local susceptibility can be calculated for arbitrary Γ1 and Γ2 using the general
formula (C16) for G(εn, h0) and the rules of analytic continuation (53). Since at h0 = 0 the impurity
Majorana fermions β1 and β2 are decoupled, the resulting model represents a direct sum of two semi-inﬁnite
KM chains (28) (see Fig. 5). Accordingly, the spectral weight of the impurity center in such a model is given
by

A(ω) = A1(ω) + A2(ω) − δ(ω) =

A. Topologically disordered phase, m > 0

In the disordered phase (m > 0), the low-frequency part of the local spectral weight A(ω; h0 = 0) is
contributed by the δ(ω) singularity in the r.h.s. of (104). The local susceptibility follows the Curie law
χ< = µ2

(106)
interpolates between the values µeﬀ = √Z1 at Γ2 = 0 (single semi-inﬁnite QIC) and µeﬀ = Z1 at Γ2 = Γ1
(equivalent to the PI chain). At Γ1, Γ2 6= 0, on approaching the criticality (m → 0) the Curie constant scales
as

Suppose that Γ1 ≫ Γ2. We consider ﬁrst the case Γ2 ≪ m ≪ Γ1.

It describes a situation when the
impurity Majorana fermion β1 is strongly hybridized with the bulk excitations of the ﬁrst chain, whereas
the fermion β2 is strongly localized. So, the impurity MZM β2 can be approximately regarded as completely
decoupled from both chains. It follows from (70), at Γ2 ≪ m ≪ Γ1 χ(2)

For two chains coupled symmetrically to the impurity, Γ1 = Γ2 ≡ Γ, the result (110) becomes χ0 = 4/πΓ.
According to (107), at m ≪ Γ the eﬀective Curie asymptotics (contained in χ<) is (m/Γ)2/T . Comparing
this to (110) we ﬁnd that

Thus, also in the channel-symmetric case (or equivalently, in a PI chain), there exists a re-entrant crossover
between two Curie regimes, χ0 = 1/T at T ≫ Γ and χ0 = (2m/Γ)2/T at T ≪ m2/Γ, separated by a
temperature independent susceptibility plateau (111).

B. Topologically ordered phase, m < 0

In the ordered phase (m < 0), the spectral weight A(ω; h0 = 0) at ω2 < m2 is given by the ﬁrst term in
the r.h.s. of (105). The subgap peaks shown in Fig. 8 describe bound states between the impurity Majorana
fermions β1, β2 and the MZMs of the bulk spectra of the corresponding chains. Depending on the relation
between the parameters m and Γ1 6= Γ2, there may be 0, 2 or 4 peaks. In the limit of a single semi-inﬁnite
chain (Γ2 → 0, Γ1 6= 0), the two peaks at ω = ±ω2 merge to produce a central peak (1/2)δ(ω) representing

Like for a single semi-inﬁnite QIC with a boundary impurity, the zero-temperature local susceptibility is
ﬁnite, but its value in the presence of two attached chains is twice smaller than the single-chain value (81)
of χ0. It may be interesting to generalize this result to junctions of n > 2 semi-inﬁnite chains.

.

(115)

This expression can again be rewritten as in Eq. (109). Using that formula, one easily checks that, in the
strong localization limit, |m| ≫ Γ1, Γ2, the high frequency corrections to χ< in (113) are small, and thus

30

χ0(0) ≃ χ<(0). In the strong hybridization regime, |m| ≪ Γ1, Γ2, the local susceptibility χ0 coincides with
χ>. As follows from our discussion in Sec. VI B3 there the 2-channel Kondo asymptotics of single-chain
susceptibilities χ(1,2)
are insensitive to the sign of m (|m| only serves as a low-energy cutoﬀ of the logarithms).
We thus conclude that in the absence of a singular low-temperature Curie susceptibility at m < 0, χ0 becomes
temperature independent at T ≪ min (Γ1, Γ2) and is given by (110).

Thus, for symmetrically coupled chains (the case of PI), the susceptibility χ0(T ) approaches the constant

>

value (114) at any T ≪ |m| if |m| ≫ Γ, or the constant value (111) at any T ≪ Γ if |m| ≪ Γ.

C. Comparing the local response: boundary impurity versus impurity in the bulk

The Kondo-like multiplicative logarithmic renormalization of χ> in (102) is a feature speciﬁc to a single
semi-inﬁnite QIC. This renormalization emerges in the strong hybridization limit, |m| ≪ Γ, where it is
contributed by the broad continuum of high-frequency states (ω2 ≫ m2) forming the ”tail” of the spectral
weight A(ω). In this frequency region (and in the leading order in |m/ω| ≪ 1) A(ω) does not depend on the
mass m and coincides with that for a critical QIC. According to formulae (69) or (82), the local susceptibility
and at T,|m| ≪ Γ displays a logarithmic asymptotics (84), as in the closely related 2-channel Kondo problem.

As we have seen in this section, for an impurity in the bulk symmetrically coupled to two equivalent
chains (which maps to a model of an impurity coupled to a semi-inﬁnite PI chain) the logarithm disappears
and χ(0) = 4/πΓ. This diﬀerence stems from the fact that in the topologically massive phases of the two
chains the impurity spin interacts with both boundary MZMs. This suppresses the singularity of the critical
low-frequency Green’s functions more strongly than in the case of a single chain attached to the impurity.

The logarithmic asymptotics (64) of the edge susceptibility of a semi-inﬁnite QIC occurs not only at
criticality but also in the quantum critical window at ﬁnite m, |m| < T ≪ Γ. The logarithmic multiplicative
renormalization of the local susceptibility is an unambiguous indication of the existence of a boundary MZM
at the impurity site. This is seen at the edge of a QIC, but not at the edge of a PI chain, which only hosts
fermionic boundary zero modes.

VIII. RELATION TO THE 1D P-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTOR MODEL

In this section we make contact with the Kitaev’s model of a 1D p-wave superconductor5 described by
the Hamiltonian (1). The pairing amplitude ∆ is chosen to be real and positive. There exists a particle-
hole transformation, an → (−1)na†n, that changes the sign of µ but keeps the rest of the Hamiltonian (1)
invariant. Therefore one can always assume that µ ≥ 0. In this region, there exists a critical point µ = t
which separates two gapped phases: the topologically trivial phase at µ > t and the topologically non-trivial
phase2,5 at µ < t.

Comparing (5) and (1) one sees that the 1DPS model exactly maps onto the QIC at ∆ = t. However,
universal scaling properties of the two models coincide in the general case provided that one concentrates on
the vicinity of the critical point. Indeed, setting µ = t + m and introducing the Majorana lattice operators
ζn and ηn (see Sec. V A), we ﬁrst rewrite the Hamiltonian (1) in the form

H =

i∆

4 Xn

(ηnζn+1 − ηn+1ζn) −

2 Xn

ηnζn.

(116)

Assuming then that |m| ≪ t, and passing to the continuum limit according to the rule (29), we ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (116) represents a surface term while the remaining part of H transforms to a
Hamiltonian of a massive Majorana fermion given by

HM =Z dx HM (x), HM (x) = ivη(x)∂xζ(x) − imη(x)ζ(x),

(117)

where v = ∆a0. From this equivalence it follows that close to the Ising criticality the ordered (m < 0) and
disordered (m > 0) phases of the QIC adequately describe the topological and non-topological phases of the

1DPS. It can be readily seen that in the vicinity of the second Ising critical point, µ = −t + m (|m| ≪ t)
the emerging continuum model still has the Majorana structure (117) but with m replaced by −m. So in
this case the nomenclature of the ordered and disordered phases according to the sign of the mass m is
inverted. This is in agreement with the known fact2,5 that the phase located within the interval −t < µ < t
is topological, whereas the phases occurring at µ > t and µ < −t are non-topological.

FIG. 9: Boundary impurity in the Kitaev-Majorana chain for a 1DPS model at µ0 = 0.

Now we can construct a model of a 1DPS on a semi-axis x > 0 with an impurity at the open end. Using

the spin-fermion equivalence (40), we associate the isolated impurity with a local d-fermion level,

where h0 = µ0/2. Accordingly, the local spin susceptibility of the semi-inﬁnite QIC, χ0, becomes proportional
to the boundary charge susceptibility (local ”compressibility”) of the 1DPS, κ0:

H0 = −µ0(d†d − 1/2) = −ih0β1β2,

χ0 = 4κ0,

κ0 =

∂nd
∂µ0

,

where nd is the mean occupancy of the d level. The bulk of the system is described by the Majorana
Hamiltonian (117). However, in a 1DPS, in addition to the standard single-particle tunneling between
the impurity site and the superconductor (t0), the hybridization term may also contain a local pairing
contribution (∆0):

While by a global gauge transformation of the fermion operators an it is possible to make in Eq. (1) the
pairing amplitude ∆ real, the phases of the global (∆) and local (∆0) amplitudes do not generally coincide.
This is why the hybridization term in (118) is characterized by three real parameters.

The ﬁrst term in (118) has the same structure as that already considered in Sec. V A. To clarify the role
of new boundary terms in the Hamiltonian, it is instructive to consider a toy KM model which involves two
impurity Majorana sites (β1 and β2) and two more sites at the open boundary of the chain (ζ1 and η1) – see
Fig. 9. The Hamiltonian of the model is given by

H4 = −

(120)

The spectrum of H4 has a E → −E symmetry and consists of two pairs of levels, ±E1 and ±E2, where

E1 =

Ω− =(cid:18) µ − µ0

+ (∆+ − ∆−)2.

(121)

(122)

32

Assuming that Ω± 6= 0, it is possible to ﬁne-tune µ0 to satisfy the condition Ω+ = Ω−, in which case the
levels ±E2 become degenerate at the value E = 0. This condition translates to

µ0 = −

4(∆+∆− + ρ2)

µ

.

(123)

The model (120) is expected to yield a satisfactory description of the boundary degrees of freedom in
the topologically disordered phase of the 1DPS. In that case it predicts the degeneracy of the occupied and
unoccupied impurity states at the speciﬁc value (123) of µ0. At that value of µ0 the local charge at the
impurity site, nd(T = 0; µ0), should display a discontinuity entirely analogous to the zero-temperature jump
of the impurity magnetization in the disordered phase of the QIC (see Sec. VI B 2). However, the extra ∆−
and ρ-terms in (120) break the local particle-hole symmetry (β2 → −β2) and thereby generate a non-zero
intrinsic local ﬁeld at the impurity site. Therefore, the impurity occupancy n±d right before and after the
jump will in general not be situated symmetrically around 1/2, but be shifted by a ﬁnite amount. In the
topologically ordered phase, it is still possible to tune the impurity degrees of freedom to bring about an
exact degeneracy between the ground and the ﬁrst excited states (which are anyway already exponentially
close in energy). However, now they diﬀer in their topological sector and thus are not connected by a local
perturbation. This suppresses the singularity in the local compressibility.

The above expectations are conﬁrmed by calculations similar to those done in Sec. V. As before, the

boundary condition for the bulk modes is (32). In the continuum limit ζ1 → √2a0ζ(a0), η1 → √2a0η(a0).
The boundary values of the ﬁelds, ζ(a0) and η(a0), can be expanded in powers of a0 → 0. Keeping the leading
terms of these expansions and using the normal mode expansion (B14) one ﬁnds the explicit expressions for
ζ(0) and η′(0) and thus derives the total Hamiltonian in terms of quasiparticle operators

Notice that, due to the boundary pairing described by the complex amplitude ∆0, both impurity Majorana
fermions, β1 and β2, hybridize with the boundary zero mode γ0, as well as with the gapped continuum states
of the bulk spectrum.

The Greens’ functions (GF) of the model (124) can be easily calculated. Since the parameter v/a0 repre-
sents an ultraviolet cutoﬀ of the theory, small terms of the order εna0/v and |m|a0/v can be systematically
dropped. Skipping the details, here we only outline the main results. From the structure of the resulting
Matsubara GFs Djk(εn) (j, k) = 1, 2, one can read oﬀ that the only eﬀect of ﬁnite ρ, ∆− is to additively
renormalize the boundary ”magnetic ﬁeld” h0 or, equivalently, the d-level local potential µ0,

h0 → ˜h0 = h0 +

4a0

v (cid:0)∆+∆− + ρ2(cid:1) .

This could have been anticipated qualitatively from Fig. 9: non-zero values of the couplings ∆− and ρ break
the local particle-hole symmetry (β2 → −β2) present at µ0 = 0 and thus contribute to an eﬀective pairing
of the Majorana fermions β1 and β2 with an amplitude ∼ ∆+∆−a0/v, ρ2a0/v. Therefore, the point of the
double degeneracy of the spectrum, i.e., the condition for the boundary impurity degree of freedom to be
classical (that is, conserved by the dynamics), is ˜h0 = 0 rather than h0 = µ0 = 0.

(126)

33

Using the obtained GFs Djk(εn) and the general formula (50) for the static local susceptibility, we ﬁnd
that at the degeneracy point ˜h0 = 0 the local charge susceptibility of the 1DPS is still given by formula
(92), where the width of the d-level is given by Γ = 4(a0/v)(∆2
+ + ρ2). With this modiﬁcation and the
redeﬁnition of the spectral degeneracy point (˜h0 = 0) the results of the preceding sections fully apply to the
1DPS model.

IX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The central result of this paper is summarized in Table I: The local equilibrium response of an edge or
bulk impurity site distinguishes the non-topological and topological phases of the bulk chains, respectively.
In the non-topological phase (or, in the disordered phase of the Ising chain), the impurity can be tuned
by the local transverse ﬁeld or the chemical potential through a degeneracy point, where the energy of a
localized boundary mode crosses zero and thus changes occupation in the ground state. At T = 0 this
change is seen as a discontinuity of the transverse magnetization (in the QIC) or the charge (PI, 1DPS) at
the impurity site. For the Ising chain and the PI the degeneracy point is dictated by symmetry to be at
h0 = ǫd = 0, while in a 1DPS one needs to tune the impurity potential µ0 to ﬁnd the degeneracy point.
At ﬁnite temperatures, being at the degeneracy point implies a Curie-type divergence of the corresponding
susceptibility as T → 0. The coeﬃcient of the Curie law tends to zero upon approaching the topological
phase transition. On the topologically (or magnetically) ordered side instead, we ﬁnd that it is impossible
to ﬁnd discontinuous response at the impurity site at T = 0, and there is no Curie-like divergence of the
susceptibility. In the case of the Ising chain this is simple to understand as the symmetry broken ground
state exerts a longitudinal ﬁeld on the impurity site, which keeps the transverse susceptibility ﬁnite despite
the occurrence of an exact spectral degeneracy at h0 = 0. However, it is less obvious to reach the analogous
statement for the PI and 1DPS models, in which the constituent physical degrees of freedom are spinless
fermions and no symmetry is spontaneously broken. A uniﬁed understanding is possible after a JW transform
of the QIC. Then the topological phase of all three models is characterized by boundary zero modes on the
semi-inﬁnite bulk chains. Their coupling with the impurity levels forbids any localized boundary mode to
cross zero energy, as a consequence of the level repulsion from the rigid zero mode which cannot be moved by
modifying local parameters. This avoids the occurrence of any degeneracy not associated with the zero mode
itself. This fact can also be understood as a consequence of the topological protection of the ordered phase
against local perturbations: A discontinuity in the local response at T = 0 would require to switch the parity.
Even though at speciﬁc values of the parameters h0, ǫd a global spectral degeneracy is encountered (such
as at h0 = ǫd = 0 for the cases of QIC and PI), this is not reﬂected in the local susceptibility, because the
relevant matrix element connects states of opposite parity. In the topological phase those are exponentially
suppressed in the system size.

The smoothness of the local charge response is easily understood in the case of a PI, upon analyzing the
two phases as the impurity potential ǫd is tuned from +∞ to −∞. In the non-topological phase, when the
degeneracy point is crossed at ǫd = 0, an extra charge enters the system and ﬁlls a level which is localized
close to the impurity. The sudden presence (at T = 0) of the new charge is seen as a discontinuity in the
charge response function nd(ǫd). On the topological side, however, a slow decrease of ǫd does not allow an
extra charge to enter at the impurity site. Indeed, at large positive ǫd, the level concentrated on the ﬁrst
site of the PI chain is occupied, having a negative energy ≈ −t2
0/ǫd, where t0 is the tunneling between the
impurity and the PI. As ǫd is reduced, that boundary state hybridizes with the impurity site, pushing the
energy down to −t0. Meanwhile, the occupancy of the impurity smoothly increases, reaching nd = 1/2 at
ǫd = 0. As ǫd becomes more negative the occupied boundary mode shifts more and more weight onto the
impurity site. Note that this level is always occupied, while its weight on the impurity site increases smoothly.
Nevertheless, for an even PI chain it follows from particle-hole symmetry that at ǫd = 0 there must be an
exact zero mode, also in the topological phase: Indeed, it corresponds to the level localized at the opposite
boundary of the PI chain. Its energy changes sign at ǫd = 0, even though it always remains exponentially
close to zero. The occupation of that boundary mode freely ﬂuctuates at any ﬁnite temperature, while at
strictly T = 0 it undergoes a sharp jump at ǫd = 0. However, neither of these are visible at the impurity site
sitting at the other end of the chain.

As usual, the distinction between the topological and the non-topological phase is sharp only at T = 0,

34

while at ﬁnite T a quantum critical window ranging roughly from −m to m smears out the transition between
the respective behaviors. Right at criticality, an impurity at the end of a semi-inﬁnite quantum Ising chain
realizes the physics of a two-channel Kondo problem, with a logarithmically diverging local susceptibility10.
This reﬂects the fact that one of the two Majoranas that form the impurity spin completely decouples from
the rest of the system.
In contrast, an impurity embedded in the bulk of a critical chain shows only a
saturating susceptibility.

We propose to use the diﬀerence between the local response in the two phases as an indirect experimental
probe for the presence or absence of topologically protected boundary zero modes. We expect very similar
thermodynamic signatures in the local response of impurities coupled to the edge of large insulators in higher
dimensions:
in its trivial gapped phase the proximity of such a system will not hinder the discontinuous
response of a nearby impurity site24. However, in the topological phase hybridization with the gapless edge
modes is expected to smoothen out the local response. A closely analogous eﬀect is indeed well-known form
coupling quantum dots to gapless Fermi liquids 25. The case of a 1d topological wire is a special case though,
in the sense that it does not possess a continuum of edge modes. Finally, we expect that this phenomenology
is robust to interactions, which are currently being discussed in the literature 26–28, as long as they do not
induce a phase transition and gap the edge. Numerical studies similar to those of Ref. 23 might help to
obtain a quantitative characterization of interaction eﬀects.

It is worthwhile to compare the equilibrium features in the local response discussed here with probes of
Majorana zero modes in transport. The latter focus on the zero-bias anomaly detected in the diﬀerential
conductance as current is passed through the wire. Thereby charge enters at one end of the wire and exits at
the opposite end. In this transport set-up the zero mode is constantly populated and emptied. In contrast,
the thermodynamics of the zero mode is essentially blind to the application of local potentials, as it never
shifts from zero energy. However, as discussed above, the zero mode has a non-trivial eﬀect on the local
spectrum at the impurity, in that it repels the available levels from zero energy. This eﬀect can be probed
by transport measurements which use the end of the wire, or an impurity coupled to it, as a quantum point
contact between source and drain contacts on either side of the wire. In such a geometry one does not expect
the zero mode to contribute to transport directly, not even at zero bias, but to show up in its indirect eﬀects
on the levels available for transmission. An analysis of these eﬀects is left for future work.

The results obtained in this paper may be relevant to the studies of topological eﬀects in junctions and/or
quasi-one-dimensional arrays of quantum spin chains and 1D p-wave superconductors. However, in this
article, we have mostly considered impurities at the end of a semi-inﬁnite chain, or impurities in the bulk
of a single chain. Only occasionally we commented on junctions of more than two semi-inﬁnite chains at an
impurity site, e.g. when predicting the critical behavior (26) of the Curie weight. Our explicit construction
of a quasi-local spin operator for junctions of quantum Ising chains suggests that also this case can be solved
exactly. It would thus be interesting to investigate potentially non-trivial traces of exchange statistics when
comparing the susceptibility of classical spins at junctions of QICs with the analogous response in junctions
of 1DPS wires. This question is of particular interest, given that such junctions are experimentally relevant
elements in any braiding set-up.

Appendix A: Impurity in a critical QIC. Comparison to the two-channel Kondo problem

Consider the model (31) and set m1 = m2 = 0, v1 = v2. Passing to new Majorana ﬁelds ξa;R,L(x), deﬁned

(A2)

The two-channel Kondo problem describes two kinds of chiral (right-moving) electrons, each carrying spin
s=1/2, which couple to the impurity spin via two channel-dependent, coupling constants. Bosonizing an
XXZ version of this model and then refermionizing, it is possible for specially chosen values of the strength
of the couplings that do not ﬂip the impurity spin (at the so-called Toulouse point) to map the original
Kondo Hamiltonian to a channel anisotropic version of the resonant-level model10,18. This model has the
structure of the Hamiltonian (A2) in which ˜J1 = α(g1 + g2), ˜J2 = α(g1 − g2), where g1,2 are the coupling
constants of spin-ﬂip processes associated with the two channels, and α is a constant.

So, for a critical QIC with an impurity in the bulk, the channel-symmetric Majorana version of the
resonant-level model emerges either at ˜J2 = 0 or ˜J1 = 0. These are the cases when the impurity spin couples
either to the right semi-axis or to left semi-axis only. In other words, only a semi-inﬁnite QIC with a boundary
impurity spin exhibits the Majorana resonant-level behavior typical for the channel-symmetric two-channel
Kondo problem. All cases with ˜J1 6= ˜J2 map to channel-asymmetric two-channel Kondo problems. In the
special case when the impurity couples to its right and left nearest-neighbor spins symmetrically ( ˜J1 = ± ˜J2),
the mapping is to a standard, one-channel resonant-level model.

(B2)

Diagonalization of this model is standard (see e.g. Ref. 29). We are looking for solutions of the Dirac
equation on an interval 0 < x < L, assuming that L → ∞:

ˆh(x)χε(x) = εχε(x),

vε(x) (cid:19) .
χε(x) =(cid:18) uε(x)

(B3)

The boundary condition

(B4)
follows from (35). From the property ˆh∗(x) = −ˆh(x) it follows that χ∗ε(x) = χ−ε(x). Therefore the spectrum
consists of (ε,−ε) pairs and, possibly, a zero-energy mode (ε = 0). This leads to the following normal-mode
expansion of the Majorana ﬁeld ξ(x):

uε(0) = −vε(0)

ξ(x) = γ0χ0(x) +Xε>0(cid:2)γεχε(x) + γ†ε χ∗ε(x)(cid:3) = ξ†(x).

(B5)

Here γ†0 = γ0 is a Majorana operator describing the localized zero mode with a normalizable wave func-
tion χ0(x), and γε, γ†ε are standard second-quantized fermionic operators describing the states within the
continuous part of the spectrum and satisfying the standard algebra

{γε, γ†ε′} = δεε′ ,

{γε, γ0} = 0,

{γ0, γ0} = 2γ2

0 = 1.

(B6)

Notice that in (B5) the summation in the second term goes over states of positive energy only. Substituting
the expansion (B5) into (B1) we arrive at the diagonalized Hamiltonian

(B8)

The algebra (34) of the Majorana ﬁelds implies the completeness relations:

u0(x)u0(x′) +Xε>0
v0(x)v0(x′) +Xε>0
u0(x)v0(x′) +Xε>0

[uε(x)u∗ε(x′) + c.c.] = δ(x − x′),
[vε(x)v∗ε (x′) + c.c.] = δ(x − x′),
[uε(x)v∗ε (x′) + c.c.] = 0.

(B11)

The solution of the Dirac equation (B3) has the following form. The normalizable zero-energy solution only
exists for m < 0:

This is an indication of the topological nature of the ordered (m < 0) massive phase of the QIC. There also
exists a continuum of extended states with energies ε2 ≥ m2. The latter are parametrized by the quantum
numbers kj = πj/L > 0 (j = 1, 2, . . . , N = L/a0):

The phase shift θk is deﬁned through the relation tan θk = m/kv. Using (B12) and (B13) one can easily
verify the relations (B8) and (B9)–(B11). The expansion (B5) takes its ﬁnal form

Appendix C: Majorana Green’s functions for the impurity

Here we derive the d-fermion GF G(εn) in the the most general case described by the Hamiltonian (39).

Appendix D: Relation to Peierls insulator

In this Appendix we consider the two-chain massive Majorana model (36) in the case when all its param-

eters referring to diﬀerent chains coincide:
˜Ja = ˜J,

va = v, ma = m (a = 1, 2).

In this case the model acquires an extra O(2)-symmetry related to global rotations of the Majorana vector
ξ = (ξ1, ξ2). Therefore it is natural to reformulate the problem in terms of a complex Dirac ﬁeld,

ψν(x) =

ξ1ν(x) + iξ2ν (x)

√2

,

(D1)

ν = R, L being the fermion chirality index. Passing simultaneously from the pair of boundary Majorana
operators (β1, β2) to the second quantized operators of the complex d-fermion, d† = (β2 + iβ1)/2, we
transform the Hamiltonian (36) to a semi-inﬁnite model of a massive, U(1)-symmetric resonant-level model:

H = εd(d†d − 1/2) − 2√2a0 ˜Jhd†ψR(0) + ψ†R(0)di
+ Z L

dx hivF (cid:16)ψ†L(x)∂xψL(x) − ψ†R(x)∂xψR(x)(cid:17) − imψR(x)ψL(x)i.

(D2)

Here εd = −2h0, and the fermionic ﬁeld satisﬁes the boundary condition ψR(0) = −ψL(0).

It is well-known that the Lorentz-invariant Dirac model (D2) emerges in the continuum description of a
spinless version of a Peierls insulator at half ﬁlling (the so-called polyacetelyne model)30,31. In a broken-
symmetry, spontaneously dimerized state the fermionic part of the PI Hamiltonian is a tight-binding model
with alternating nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes:

HPI = −Xn≥1

tn,n+1(cid:0)c†ncn+1 + h.c.(cid:1) ,

tn,n+1 = t − (−1)n∆.

(D3)

At |∆| ≪ t a continuum limit can be taken in (D3),

cn → √a0 [inψR(x) + (−i)nψL(x)] ,

(kF = π/2a0),

yielding the bulk term in (D2) with vF = 2ta0 and m = 2∆. The ground state of the Hamiltonan (D3)
is dimerized. Accordingly, there are two massive phases, ∆ = ±∆0, separated by a gapless metallic state
(∆ = 0). The two phases with the same |∆| have identical bulk spectra. Their topological diﬀerence21 shows
up in the boundary conditions at the edges of a ﬁnite chain. Repeating the Kitaev’s argument and turning
to special cases ∆ = ±t (with t > 0) one ﬁnds a topologically degenerate ground state with two boundary
zero modes at ∆ < 0 and a nondegenerate ground state at ∆ > 0. These zero modes are bound states of a
massive complex fermion, each state carrying a fractional fermion number (charge) qF = 1/231,32.

The Green’s function of the impurity d-fermion for the PI, G(εn), is given in Appendix C, Eq. (C20).
Passing to the retarded GF G(ω + iδ) we can calculate the spectral weight Af (ω) of the d-electron states.
The result is given by Eqs. (57) and (58).
