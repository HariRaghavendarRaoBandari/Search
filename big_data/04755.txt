ABSTRACT
Massive stars that have been ejected from their parent cluster and supersonically sailing away
through the interstellar medium (ISM) are classiﬁed as exiled. They generate circumstellar
bow shock nebulae that can be observed. We present two-dimensional, axisymmetric hydro-
dynamical simulations of a representative sample of stellar wind bow shocks from Galactic
OB stars in an ambient medium of densities ranging from nISM = 0.01 up to 10.0 cm−3. Inde-
pendently of their location in the Galaxy, we conﬁrm that the infrared is the most appropriated
waveband to search for bow shocks from massive stars. Their spectral energy distribution is
the convenient tool to analyze them since their emission does not depend on the temporary ef-
fects which could affect unstable, thin-shelled bow shocks. Our numerical models of Galactic
bow shocks generated by high-mass (≈ 40 M⊙) runaway stars yield Hα ﬂuxes which could be
observed by facilities such as the SuperCOSMOS H-Alpha Survey. The brightest bow shock
nebulae are produced in the denser regions of the ISM. We predict that bow shocks in the ﬁeld
observed at Hα by means of Rayleigh-sensitive facilities are formed around stars of initial
mass larger than about 20 M⊙. Our models of bow shocks from OB stars have the emission
maximum in the wavelength range 3 6 λ 6 50 µm which can be up to several orders of
magnitude brighter than the runaway stars themselves, particularly for stars of initial mass
larger than 20 M⊙.

This results in diaphanous H II regions (Dyson 1975), parsec-scale
bubbles of stellar wind (Weaver et al. 1977), inﬂated (Petrovic et al.
2006) or shed (Woosley et al. 2002; Garcia-Segura et al. 1996)
stellar envelopes that impact their close surroundings and which
can alter the propagation of their subsequent supernova shock
wave (van Veelen 2010; Meyer et al. 2015). Understanding the
formation processes of these circumstellar structures allows us to
constrain the impact of massive stars, e.g. on the energetics or the
chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). Moreover,
it links studies devoted to the dynamical evolution of supernova
remnants expanding into the perturbed ISM (Rozyczka et al.
1993) with works focusing on the physics of the star forming
ISM (Peters et al. 2010).

While bow-shock-like structures can develop around any as-

trophysical object that moves supersonically with respect to its
ambient medium (see e.g. Thun et al. 2016), it particularly affects
the surroundings of bright stars running through the ISM (Blaauw
1961). These arc-like structures of swept-up stellar wind mate-
rial and ISM gas are the result of the distortion of their stellar
wind bubble by the bulk motion of their central star (Weaver et al.
1977). Their size and their morphology are governed by their stellar
wind mass loss, the wind velocity, the bulk motion of the runaway
star and their local ambient medium properties (Comer´on & Kaper
1998). These distorted wind bubbles have been ﬁrst noticed in op-
tical [OIII] λ 5007 spectral emission line around the Earth’s clos-
est runaway star, the OB star ζ Ophiuchi (Gull & Soﬁa 1979).
Other noticeable fast-moving massive stars producing a stellar
wind bow shock are, e.g. the blue supergiant Vela-X1 (Kaper et al.
1997), the red supergiant Betelgeuse (Noriega-Crespo et al. 1997)
and the very massive star BD+43◦365 running away from Cygnus
OB2 (Comer´on & Pasquali 2007).

Analysis of data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
facility (IRAS, Neugebauer et al. 1984) later extended to mea-
sures taken with the Wide-Field Infrared Satellite Explorer (WISE,
Wright et al. 2010) led to the compilation of bow shock records, see
e.g. (van Buren & McCray 1988). Soon arose the speculation that
those isolated nebulae can serve as a tool independent on assump-

tions regarding the internal physics of these stars, to constrain the
still highly debated mass loss of massive stars (Gull & Soﬁa 1979)
and/or their ambient medium density (Huthoff & Kaper 2002). This
also raised questions related to the ejection mechanisms of OB
stars from young stellar clusters (Hoogerwerf et al. 2001). More re-
cently, multi-wavelengths data led to the publication of the E-BOSS
catalog of stellar wind bow shocks (Peri et al. 2012, 2015).

Early simulations discussed the general morphology of the
bow shocks around OB stars (Brighenti & D’Ercole 1995, , and
references therein), their (in)stability (Blondin & Koerwer 1998)
and the general uncompatibility of the shape of stellar wind bow
shocks with analytical approximations such as the one of Wilkin
(1996), see in Comer´on & Kaper (1998). However, observing mas-
sive star bow shocks remains difﬁcult and they are mostly serendip-
itously noticed in infrared observations of the neighbourhood of
stellar clusters (Gvaramadze & Bomans 2008). Moreover, their op-
tical emission may be screened by the H II
region which sur-
rounds the driving star and this may affect their Hα observa-
tions (Brown & Bomans 2005). We are particularly interested in
the prediction of the easiest bow shocks to observe, their optical
emission properties and their location in the Galaxy.

In the present study, we extend our numerical investigation of
the circumstellar medium of runaway massive stars (Meyer et al.
2014, hereafter Paper I). Note that our approach is primarily fo-
cussed on exploring the parameter space, rather than a series of
simulations tailored to a speciﬁc bow shock nebula. Our parameter
study explores the effects of the ambient medium density on the
emission properties of the bow-like nebulae around the most com-
mon runaway stars, in the spirit of works on bow shocks generated
by low-mass stars (Villaver et al. 2012, and references therein). The
underlying assumptions are the same as in our previous purely hy-
drodynamical models, i.e. we neglect the magnetisation of the ISM,
ignore any intrinsic inhomogeneity in the ISM density ﬁeld and
consider that both the wind and the ISM gas are a perfect gas.

Our paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present
the numerical methods and the microphysics that is included in our
models. The resulting numerical simulations are presented and dis-
cussed in Section 3. We then analyze and discuss the emission prop-
erties of our bow shock models in Section 4. Finally, we formulate
our conclusions in Section 5.

2.1 Governing equations

tions of hydrodynamics. It is a set of equations for mass conserva-
tion,

and where ρ is the mass density of the gas, p its pressure, v the
vector velocity. The temperature of the gas is given by,

T = µ

,

(5)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and µ is the mean molecular
weight, such that ρ = µnmH with n the total number density of
the ﬂuid and mH the mass of a hydrogen atom. The adiabatic in-
dex of the gas is γ = 5/3. The Eq. (3) includes (i) the effects of
both the cooling and the heating of the gas by optically-thin radia-
tive processes and (ii) the transport of heat by electronic thermal
conduction (see Section 2.3).

2.2 Hydrodynamical simulations

We run two-dimensional, axisymmetric, hydrodynamical numer-
ical simulations using the PLUTO code (Mignone et al. 2007,
2012) in axisymmetric, cylindrical coordinates on a uniform grid
[zmin, zmax] × [O, Rmax] of spatial resolution ∆ = 2.25 ×
10−4 pc cell−1 minimum. The stellar wind is injected into the com-
putational domain ﬁlling a circle of radius 20 cells centered onto
the origin O (see e.g., Comer´on & Kaper 1998; Meyer et al. 2014,
and references therein). The interaction with the ISM is calculated
in the reference frame of the moving star (van Marle et al. 2007,
2011, 2014). Inﬂowing ISM gas mimicing the stellar motion is set
at the z = zmax boundary whereas semi-permeable boundary con-
ditions are set at z = zmin and at R = Rmax. Wind material is
distinguished from the ISM using a passive tracer Q that is ad-
vected with the gas and initially set to Q = 1 in the stellar wind
and to Q = 0 in the ISM. The ISM composition is assumed to be
solar (Asplund et al. 2009).

The stellar models are calculated using the stellar evolution
code of Heger et al. (2005); Yoon & Langer (2005); Petrovic et al.
(2005) also described in Brott et al. (2011). It includes the mass
loss recipe of Kudritzki et al. (1989) for the main sequence-phase
and of de Jager et al. (1988) for the red supergiant phase. The stel-
lar properties are displayed in ﬁg. 3 of Paper I while we summarize
the wind properties at the beginning of our simulations in our Ta-
ble 1.

2.3 Microphysics

In order to proceed on our previous bow shock studies (Paper I,
Meyer et al. 2015), we include the same microphysics in our simu-
lations of the circumstellar medium of runaway, massive stars, i.e.
we take into account losses and gain of internal energy by optically-
thin cooling and heating together with electronic thermal conduc-
tion. Optically-thin radiative processes are included into the model
using the cooling and heating laws established for a fully ionized
medium in Paper I. They are the right-hand term Φ(T, ρ) of Eq. (3)
which is given by,

Φ(T, ρ) = nHΓ (T ) − n2

H

Λ(T ),

(6)

where Γ (T ) and Λ(T ) are the heating and cooling laws, respec-
tively, and nH is the hydrogen number density. It mainly consist of
cooling contributions from hydrogen and helium for temperatures
T < 106 K whereas it is principally due to metals for temperatures
T > 106 K (Wiersma et al. 2009). A term representing the cooling
from collisionally excited forbidden lines (Henney et al. 2009) in-
corporates the effects of, among other, the [OIII] λ 5007 line emis-
sion. The heating contribution includes the reionisation of recom-
bining hydrogen atoms by the starlight (Osterbrock & Bochkarev
1989; Hummer 1994). All our models include electronic ther-
mal conduction (Cowie & McKee 1977). The divergence term in
Eq. (3) represents the ﬂux of heat,

Fc = κ∇T,

(7)

where κ is the heat conduction coefﬁcient (Spitzer 1962). More
details about thermal conduction is also given in Paper I.

2.4 Parameter range

This work consists of a parameter study extending our previous in-
vestigation of stellar wind bow shock (Paper I) to regions of the

Galaxy where the ISM has either lower or higher densities. We per-
form re-runs of the models in Paper I that correspond to the main-
sequence phase of our stars, but assume a different ISM background
density and only consider the cases where the main-sequence life-
time of the stars is larger than the four crossing times of the gas
|zmax − zmin|/v⋆ through the whole computational domain which
are necessary to model steady state bow shocks. The boundary con-
ditions are unchanged, i.e. we consider runaway stars of 10, 20 and
40 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) star moving with velocity
v⋆ = 20, 40 and 70 km s−1, respectively. Differences come from
the chosen ISM number density that ranges from nISM = 0.01 to
10.0 cm−3 whereas our preceeding work exclusively focused on
bow shocks models with nISM = 0.79 cm−3. The simulation la-
bels are summarised in Table 2. The analysis of our simulations

include the main-sequence models with nISM = 0.79 cm−3 of Pa-
per I and we refer to them using their original labels.

3 BOW SHOCKS MORPHOLOGY

3.1 Bow shocks structure

In Fig. 1 we show the density ﬁelds in our hydrodynamical
simulations of our 20 M⊙ ZAMS star moving with velocity
v⋆ = 70 km s−1 in a medium of number density nISM = 0.01
(panel a, model MS2070n0.01), 0.1 (panel b, model MS2070n0.1),
0.79 (panel c, model MS2070) and 10.0 cm−3 (panel d, model
MS2070n10), respectively. The ﬁgures correspond to times about
4.14, 3.29, 3.08 and 3.03 Myr after the beginning of the main-
sequence phase. Our bow shocks have the typical structure of a
circumstellar nebulae generated by a fast-moving OB star undergo-
ing the conjugated effects of both cooling and heating by optically-
thin radiative processes and thermal conduction and the thickness
of the shock layer depends on whether the shocks are adiabatic
or radiative, which in their turn depends on the shock conditions,
see Comer´on & Kaper (1998), Paper I and the references therein.
All our bow shock simulations have such a structure.

3.2 Bow shocks size

The bow shocks have a stand-off distance R(0), i.e. the distance
separating them from the star along the direction of motion pre-
dicted by Wilkin (1996). It decreases as a function of (i) v⋆, (ii)
˙M (c.f. Paper I) and (iii) nISM since R(0) ∝ n−1/2
ISM . A dense am-
bient medium produces a large ISM ram pressure nISMv2
⋆ which
results in a compression of the whole bow shock and consequently
in a reduction of R(0). As an example, our simulations involving a
20 M⊙ ZAMS star with v⋆ = 70 km s−1 has R(0) ≈ 3.80, 1.14,
0.38 and 0.07pc when the driving star moves in nISM = 0.01, 0.1,
0.79 and 10 cm−3, respectively (Fig. 1a-d), which is reasonably in
accordance with Wilkin (1996). All our measures of R(0) are taken
at the contact discontinuity, because it is appropriate measure to
compare models with Wilkin’s analytical solution (Mohamed et al.
2012).

In Fig. 2 we plot the ratio R(0)/R(90) as a function of the
stand-off distance of the bow shocks, where R(90) is the distance
between the star and the bow shock measured along the direction
perpendicular to the direction of motion. The internal structure of
the bow shocks depends on the stellar wind and the bulk motion of
the star (Paper I) but are also sensible to the ISM density. Important
variations in the stars’ ambient local medium can produce large
compression of the region of shocked ISM gas, which in its turn
decreases up to form a thin layer of cold shocked ISM gas (see
Fig. 1b and ﬁg. 1 of Comer´on & Kaper 1998). This phenomenon
typically arises in simulations combining moving stars with strong
mass loss such as our 40 M⊙ ZAMS star, together with velocity
v⋆ > 40 km s−1 and/or nISM > 1 cm−3 (see large magenta dots
in Fig. 2). Those thin-shells are more prone to develop non-linear
instabilities (Vishniac 1994; Garcia-Segura et al. 1996).

Interestingly, analytic approximations of the overall shape of
a bow shock often assume such an inﬁnitely thin structure (Wilkin

1996) and predict that R(0)/R(90) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.58. Thin shells

are very unstable and experience periodical large distortions which
can make the shape of the bow shock inconsistent with Wilkin’s
prediction of R(0)/R(90) (see black arrows in Fig. 2). Most of

alytic solution R(0)/R(90) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.58 of Wilkin (1996). The large

purple dots highlight the unstable bow shocks.

the models are within 20 per cent of Wilkin’s solution (see hori-
zontal black line at R(0)/R(90) ≈ 1/√3). Only a few models
have R(0)/R(90) 6 1/√3 because their opening is smaller than
predicted. However, some simulations with v⋆ = 20 km s−1 have
large and spread bow shocks in which R(0)/R(90) > 0.62, see
e.g. our simulation MS2020n0.1 with R(90) ≈ 4.51 pc.

3.3 Non-linear instabilities and mixing of material

In Fig. 3 we show a time sequence evolution of the density ﬁeld
in hydrodynamical simulations of 40 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence
star moving with velocity v⋆ = 70 km s−1 in a medium of num-
ber density n = 10.0 cm−3 (model MS4070n10). The ﬁgures are
shown at times 0.02 (a), 0.05 (b), 0.11 (c) and 0.12 Myr (d), re-
spectively. After 0.02 Myr the whole shell is sparsed with small
size clumps which are the seeds of non-linear instabilities (Fig. 3b).
The fast stellar motion (v⋆ = 70 km s−1) provokes a distortion of
the bubble into an ovoid shape (see ﬁg. 7 of Weaver et al. 1977)
and the high ambient medium density (n = 10.0 cm−3) induces
rapidly a thin shell after only about 0.01 Myr.

The bow shock then experiences a series of cycles in which
small scaled eddies grow in the shell (Fig. 3b) and further distort
its apex into wing-like structures (Fig. 3c) which are pushed side-
wards because of the transverse component of the stellar wind ac-
celeration (Fig. 3d). Our model MS4070n10 has both characteris-
tics from the models E ” High ambient density” and G ” Instan-
taneous cooling” of Comer´on & Kaper (1998). Thin-shelled stel-
lar wind bow shocks develop non-linear instabilities, in addition
to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that typically affect interfaces
between shearing ﬂows of opposite directions, i.e. the outﬂowing
stellar wind and the ISM gas penetrating the bow shocks (Vishniac
1994; Garcia-Segura et al. 1996; van Marle et al. 2007). A detailed
discussion of the development of such non-linearities affecting bow
shocks generated by OB runaway stars is in Comer´on & Kaper
(1998).

In Fig. 4 we plot the evolution of the volume of the bow shock

In Fig. 5 the total bow shock luminosity Ltotal (pale green
diamonds) is calculated integrating the losses by optically-thin
radiation in the z > 0 region of
the computational do-
main (Mohamed et al. 2012, Paper I). Shocked wind emission
Lwind (orange dots) is discriminated from Ltotal with the help of
the passive scalar Q that is advected with the gas, such that,

respectively. This allows us to isolate the stellar wind material in

L[OIII] (dark green triangles) which stand for the bow shock lu-
minosities at Hα and at [OIII] λ 5007 spectral line emission us-
ing the prescriptions for the emission coefﬁcients in Dopita (1973)
and Osterbrock & Bochkarev (1989), respectively. The overall X-
ray luminosity LX (black right crosses) is computed with emis-
sion coefﬁcients generated with the XSPEC program (Arnaud 1996)
with solar metalicity and chemical abundances from Asplund et al.
(2009). The total infrared emission LIR (red squares) is estimated
as a reemission of a fraction of the starlight bolometric ﬂux on
dust grains of gas-to-dust mass ratio 200, which are assumed to
be present in the bow shocks. We assume that all dust grains are
spherical silicates particles of radius a = 5.0 nm only, which are
mixed with the gas and continuously penetrate the bow shock as we
assume that the star moves with a constant velocity. More details on
the dust model and the infrared estimate of the bow shock emission
is given in Appendix B of Paper I.

Figure 3. Same as Fig. 1 for our 40 M⊙ ZAMS star moving through
an ISM of density nISM = 10.0 cm−3 with velocity 70 km s−1 (model
MS4070n10). Figures are shown at times 0.02 (a), 0.05 (b), 0.11 (c) and
0.12 Myr (d) after the beginning of the main sequence phase of the star,
respectively. It illustrates the development of the non-linear thin-shell insta-
bility in the bow shock.

in our model MS4070n10 (thick solid blue line), separating the vol-
ume of shocked ISM gas (thin dotted red line) from the volume of
shocked stellar wind (thick dotted orange line) in the apex (z > 0)
of the bow shock. Such a discrimination of the volume of wind and
ISM gas is possible because a passive scalar tracer is is numeri-
cally advected simultaneously with the ﬂow. The ﬁgure further il-
lustrates the preponderance of the volume of shocked ISM in the
bow shock compared to the stellar wind material, regardless the
growth of eddies. Interestingly, the volume of dense shocked ISM
gas (large dotted black line) does not have large time variations (see
Section 4).

4.2 Results

4.2.1 Optical luminosities

In Fig. 5 we display the bow shocks luminosities as a function of
the initial mass of the runaway star, its space velocity v⋆ and its
ambient medium density nISM. At a given density of the ISM, all
of our models have luminosities from optically-thin gas radiation
which varies with respect to the stellar mass loss are as described
in Paper I for the simulations with nISM ≈ 0.79 cm−3. We can
identify three major trends for the behaviour of the luminosity:

(i) The total luminosity Ltotal decreases by at least an order of
magnitude between the simulations with v⋆ = 20 to 70 km s−1.
For example, our 10 M⊙ ZAMS star, moving with velocity v⋆ =
20 km s−1 in an ISM of nISM ≈ 0.01 cm−3, has Ltotal ≈

Figure 6. Luminosities of our bow shock simulation of a 40 M⊙ ZAMS
star moving with velocity v⋆ = 70 km s−1 through a medium with
nISM = 10 cm−3 (see corresponding time-sequence evolution of its den-
sity ﬁeld in Fig. 3a-e). Plotted quantities and color-coding are similar to
Fig. 5 and are shown as function of time (in Myr).

1.82 × 1031 erg s−1 whereas the same star, moving through the
same ISM but with velocity v⋆ = 70 km s−1, has Ltotal ≈
2.29 × 1030 erg s−1 (see models MS1020n0.01 and MS1070n0.01
in Fig 5a). This arises because if the space motion of the star in-
creases the compression factor of the shell of shocked ISM gas in
the bow shock, it also reduces its volume which decreases the emis-
sion by optical-thin radiative processes (Meyer et al. 2014).

(ii) The total bow shock luminosity by optically-thin processes
increases by several orders of magnitude with ˙M . For example,
the bow shock produced by our 10 M⊙ ZAMS star moving with
velocity v⋆ = 40 km s−1 in an ISM of nISM ≈ 0.01 cm−3 has
Ltotal ≈ 8.68 × 1030 erg s−1 whereas our 20 M⊙ ZAMS star
moving with the same speed through an identical medium has
Ltotal ≈ 5.38 × 1033 erg s−1 (see models MS1040n0.01 and
MS2040n0.01 in Fig 5a).
In that sense, our results conﬁrm that
the bow shock volume which increases with ˙M and decreases with
v⋆ governs their luminosity by optically-thin cooling.

(iii) Finally, the bow shock luminosity decreases if the ambi-
ent medium density nISM increases. This happens because a larger
nISM decreases the volume of the bow shock ∝ R(90)3 since
R(90) ∝ 1/√nISM, which has a stronger inﬂuence over the lu-
minosity than the fact that the density in the post-shock region
at the forward shock ∝ nISM/4 increases. For example, the bow
shocks generated by our 20 M⊙ ZAMS star moving with velocity
v⋆ = 70 km s−1 in an ISM of density nISM = 0.01, 0.1, 0.79 and
10.0 cm−3 have a bow shock luminosity Ltotal ≈ 2.04 × 1033,
2.59 × 1033, 3.72 × 1033 and 5.62 × 1033 erg s−1 respectively,
see models MS2070n0.01, MS2070n0.1, MS2070 and MS2070n10
(Fig. 1a-d). This further illustrates the dominant role of the bow
shock volume on Ltotal, which is governed by the compression of
˙M
the shell and by the strength of its stellar wind momentum, i.e.
and vw.

The behaviour of the optically-thin emission originating from
the shocked stellar wind Lwind, the [OIII] λ 5007 spectral line
emission and the Hα emission at ﬁxed nISM are similar as de-
scribed in Meyer et al. (2014). The contribution of Lwind is smaller
than Ltotal by several orders of magnitude for all models, e.g. our
model MS1020n0.1 has Lwind/Ltotal ≈ 10−5. All our models
have LHα < L[OIII] < Ltotal and the Hα emission, the [OIII]

Figure 7. Comparison between the bow shock luminosity of reprocessed starlight Lbow = LIR and the infrared stellar emission L⋆, both in the wavelength
range [3; 50] µm (a). Ratio (in %) of the energy deposited per unit time due to the motion of the bow shock with its losses per unit time because of optically-thin
cooling (b).

spectral line emission and Lwind have variations which are similar
to LISM with respect to M⋆, v⋆ and nISM.

Fig. 6 shows the lightcurve of our model MS4070n10 com-
puted over the whole simulation and plotted as a function of time
with the color coding from Fig. 5. Very little variations of the emis-
sion are present at the beginning of the calculation up to a time of
about 0.004 Myr and it remains almost constant at larger times. We
infer that in the case of a bow shock producing a thin shell of den-
sity larger than about 10 cm−3, the distortions of the global struc-
ture are largely irrelevant to the luminosity, which is dominated by
the dense, shocked, cold ISM gas (see discussion in 4.3). This is in
accordance with the volume of the dense ISM gas trapped into the
nebula (see large dotted black line in Fig. 4). The independence of
LIR with respect to the strong volume ﬂuctuations of thin-shelled
nebulae (Fig. 6) indicates that their spectral energy distributions is
likely to be the appropriate tool to analyze them since it constitutes
an observable which is not reliable to temporary effects.

4.2.2 Infrared and X-rays luminosities

Not surprisingly, the infrared luminosity, which originates from re-
processed starlight on dust grains penetrating the bow shocks, LIR,
is larger than Ltotal by about 1 − 2 orders of magnitude. This is
possible because the reemission of starlight by dust grains is not
taken into account in our simulations. Unlike the optical luminos-
ity, the infrared luminosity increases with nISM, e.g. our models
with M⋆ = 10 M⊙ and v⋆ = 20 km s−1 have LIR ≈ 1.6 × 1033,
5.0 × 1033, 9.92 × 1033 and 3.43 × 1034 erg s−1 if nISM = 0.01,
0.1, 0.79 and 10.0 cm−3, respectively. Moreover, the ratio be-
tween LIR and Ltotal increases with nISM, e.g. LIR/Ltotal ≈ 8.6
and 144.1 for the models MS2040n0.01 and MS2040n10, respec-
tively. LIR increases with M⋆ (Figs. 5a-d). Particularly, we ﬁnd
that LIR ≫ LHα and LIR ≫ L[OIII], and therefore we conclude
that the infrared waveband is the best way to detect and observe
bow shocks from massive main-sequence runaway stars regardless
of nISM (see section 4.3.1).

Note that, according to the prescription for the dust tempera-

ture,

Td(r) = Teﬀ(cid:16) R⋆
2r (cid:17)

2

4+s ,

(10)

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

where Teﬀ is the effective temperature of the moving star, R⋆ its
radius and s a parameter giving the slope of the opacity in the
infrared regime (Spitzer 1978; Kuiper et al. 2012, and references
therein). With s = 1 (Decin et al. 2006), it follows that the dust
temperature of, e.g. our models with nISM = 0.79 cm−3 is about
Td 6 100 K in the bow shock. The Planck distribution of such
temperatures would peak in the mid infrared and therefore one can
expect that the dust continuum emission of the bow shocks lies in
the wavelength range 3 6 λ 6 50 µm. In Fig. 7a we compare the
bow shocks and the stellar luminosities in this wavelength range,
assuming that the 10, 20 and 40 M⊙ ZAMS runaway stars are black
bodies. Most of the bow shocks generated by a star of initial mass
> 20 M⊙ are brighter in infrared than their central runaway star.
This indicates that bow shocks can dominate the emission up to
several orders of magnitudes for wavelengths 3 6 λ 6 50 µm
and that saturation effects of the observations are improbable for
those stars.

Several current and/or planned facilities are designed to ob-
serve at these wavelengths and may be able to detect bow shocks
from runaway stars:

(i) First, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which Mid-
Infrared Instrument (MIRI, Swinyard et al. 2004) observes in the
infrared (5−28 µm) that roughly corresponds to our predicted
waveband of dust continuum emission from stellar wind bow
shocks of runaway OB stars.

(ii) Secondly, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared As-
tronomy (SOFIA) airborne facility which Faint Object infraRed
CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST, Adams et al. 2008)
instrument detects photons in the 5.4−37 µm waveband.
(iii) Then, the proposed Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmol-
ogy and Astrophysics (SPICA, Kaneda et al. 2004) satellite would
be the ideal tool the observe stellar wind bow shock, since it is
planed to be mounted with (i) a far-infrared imaging spectrome-
ter (30−210 µm), (ii) a mid-infrared coronograph (3.5/5−27 µm)
and (iii) a mid-infrared camera/spectrometer (5−38 µm).
(iv) Finally, we should mention the proposed The Mid-infrared
E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) on the planned Euro-
pean Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT, Brandl et al. 2006), that
will be able to scan the sky in the 3−19 µm waveband.

gions surroundings young stellar clusters and/or at the locations of
previously detected bow-like nebulae (van Buren & McCray 1988;
van Buren et al. 1995; Noriega-Crespo et al. 1997; Peri et al. 2012,
2015) are research avenues to be explored.

Finally, we notice that the X-rays emission are much smaller
than any other emission lines or bands, e.g. the model MS2070 has
LX/LHα ≈ 10−5, and it is consequently not a relevant waveband
to observe our bow shocks.

4.2.3 Feedback

We compute the energy rate ˙Emotion deposited to the ISM by the
stellar motion. It is estimated by multiplying the rate of volume of
ISM swept-up with the bow shock per unit time ˙V ≈ πR(90)2v⋆
by the ISM kinetic energy density deﬁned as ǫISM = ρISM∆v2/2,
with ∆v is the changes in velocity across the shock. In the frame
of reference of the moving star ∆v = ||v⋆ − vgas||, and,

ǫISM =

ρISM||v⋆ − vgas||2,

(11)

1
2

9
32

where vgas is the gas velocity at the post-shock region at the for-
ward shock. Since the Rankine-Hugoniot relation indicates that
vgas ≈ v⋆/4, then the relation ˙Emotion = ˙V ǫISM reduces to,

˙Emotion =

ρISMv3

⋆πR(90)2,

(12)

where ρISM is the ISM gas mass density.

The ratio ˙Emotion/Ltotal is shown as a function of the bow
shock volume in Fig. 7b. The simulations with M⋆ > 20 M⊙ have
a bow shock with ˙Emotion/Ltotal 6 100% which indicates that
their associated nebulae have energy losses by optically-thin radia-
tive processes more important than the energy deposition by the
stellar motion itself to the replenishing of the ISM. Our 10 M⊙
ZAMS star can produce bow shocks having ˙Emotion/Ltotal ≫
100%. However, since fast-moving 10 M⊙ stars are the most com-
mon Galactic runaway stars of our sample (Eldridge et al. 2011),
it is difﬁcult to estimate which sub-population of runaway massive
stars, and by which process, contributes the most to the Galactic
feedback. A population synthesis study, beyond the scope of this
work, is therefore necessary to assess this question.

4.3 Discussion

4.3.1 The appropriated waveband to observe stellar wind bow

shocks in the Galaxy

show the Hα surface

In Fig.
(in
erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2, panels a-c) and the infrared lumi-
nosity (in erg s−1, panels d-f) for models with M⋆ = 10 M⊙
(left panels), 20 M⊙ (middle panels) and 40 M⊙ (right panels).
Hα scales with n2, see Appendix A of
The surface brightness Σmax
Paper I, therefore the lower the ISM background density of the
star, i.e. the higher its Galactic latitude, the fainter the projected
emission of the bow shocks and the lower the probability to
observe them. The brightest bow shocks are generated both in
infrared and Hα by our most massive stars running in the denser
regions of the ISM (nISM = 10.0 cm−3). The estimate of the
infrared luminosity conﬁrms our earlier result relative to bow
shock models with nISM = 0.79 cm−3 in the sense that the
brightest bow shocks are produced by high-mass, stars (Paper I)
moving in a relatively dense ambient medium, i.e. within the
Galactic plane (Fig. 8d-f). At Hα, these bow shocks are associated
to fast-moving stars (v⋆ = 70 km s−1) producing the strongest

shocks, whereas in infrared they are associated to slowly-moving
stars (v⋆ = 20 km s−1) generating the largest nebulae.

4.3.2 Synthetic optical emission maps

In Fig. 9 we plot synthetic Hα and [OIII] λ 5007 emission maps
of the bow shocks generated by our 20 M⊙ ZAMS star moving
with velocity 70 km s−1 moving through a medium with nISM =
0.1 (left column of panels), 0.79 (middle column of panels) and
10.0 cm−3 (right column of panels). The region of maximum Hα
emission of the gas is located close to the apex of the bow shock and
extended to its trail (z 6 0). This broadening of the emitting region
is due to the high space velocity of the star, see Paper I. Neither the
shocked stellar wind nor the hot shocked ISM of the bow shock
contributes signiﬁcantly to these emission since the Hα emission
coefﬁcient jHα ∝ T −0.9 and the contact discontinuity is the bright-
est part of the whole structure (Fig. 9a). The [OIII] λ 5007 emission
is maximum at the same location but, however, slightly different de-
pendence on the temperature of the corresponding emission coefﬁ-
cient j[OIII] ∝ exp(−1/T )/T 1/2 (Dopita 1973) induces a weaker
extension of the emission to the tail of the structure (Fig. 9a). The
unstable simulations with v⋆ > 40 km s−1 and nISM ≃ 10 cm−3
have ring-like artefacts which dominate the emission (see Fig. 9e-h
and Fig. 9i-l). They are artiﬁcially generated by the over-dense re-
gions of the shell that are rotated and mapped onto the Cartesian
grid. A tri-dimensional unstable bow shock would have brighter
clumps of matters sparsed around its layer of cold shocked ISM
rather than regular rings (Mohamed et al. 2012). Regardless of the
properties of their driving star, our bow shocks are brighter in
large ambient medium, e.g. the model MS2070n0.1 has Σmax
[Hα] ≈
10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 whereas the model MS2070n10 has
Σmax
[Hα] ≈ 3 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. The projected [OIII]
λ 5007 emission behaves similarly.
In Fig. 10 we show cross-sections of the Hα surface bright-
ness of the model MS2070n0.1. The cuts are taken along the sym-
metry axis of the ﬁgures and plotted as a function of the inclina-
tion angle φ with respect to the plane of the sky. The emission
rises slightly as φ increases from for φ = 30◦ (thin red solid line)
to φ = 60◦ (thick solid orange line) since Σmax
[Hα] peaks at about
6 × 10−19 and about 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2, respectively.
The case with φ = 90◦ is different since the emission decreases
to about ≈ 2 × 10−19 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 (see thick dotted
green line in Fig. 10). The same is true for the [OIII] emission
since its dependence on the post-shock density is similar. These
differences arise because a line-of-sight corresponding to φ = 60◦
intercepts a larger amount of dense, emitting material in the layer
of shocked ISM than a line-of-sight corresponding to φ 6 30◦
or φ = 90◦. Large angles of inclination make the opening of
the bow shocks larger (Fig. 10a-c, e-g, i-k) and the stand-off dis-
tance appears smaller (Fig. 10a-c). Note that bow shocks observed
with a viewing angle of φ = 90◦ do not resemble an arc-like
shape but rather an overlapping of iso-emitting concentric circles
(Fig. 10d,h,l).

in the logarithmic scale. We display these quantities for our models with M⋆ = 10 M⊙ (left panels), 20 M⊙ (middle panels) and 40 M⊙ (right panels). The
hatched regions indicate that the corresponding bow shock models are not included in our grid of simulations, since the duration of the main-sequence phase
of these stars does not allow to generate bow shocks in a steady state at these ambient medium density. On each plot the horizontal axis is the ambient medium
density nISM (in cm−3) and the vertical axis is the space velocity v⋆ (in km s−1) of our runaway stars.

star have a volume smaller than about a few pc3 and have emission
smaller than about 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. The models
with M⋆ = 20 M⊙ have larger volume at equal nISM and can reach
surface brightness of about a few 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 if
nISM = 10 cm−3. Note that all models with nISM > 10.0 cm−3
produce emission larger than the diffuse emission sensitivity
threshold of the SuperCOSMOS H-Alpha Survey (SHS) of ΣSHS ≈
1.1-2.8 × 1017 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 (Parker et al. 2005) and
such bow shocks should consequently be observed by this survey
(see horizontal black line in Fig. 11a).

As discussed above, a signiﬁcant fraction of our sample of
bow shocks models have a Hα surface brightness larger than the
sensitivity limit of the SHS survey (Parker et al. 2005). This re-
mark can be extended to other (all-sky) Hα observations cam-
paigns, especially if their detection threshold is lower than the SHS.
This is the case of, e.g. the Virginia Tech Spectral-Line Survey
survey (VTSS, Dennison et al. 1999) and the Wisconsin H-Alpha
Mapper (WHAM, Reynolds et al. 1998) which provide us with im-
ages of diffuse sensitivity detection limit that allow the revelation
of structures associated with sub-Rayleigh intensity. Consequently,
one can expect to ﬁnd optical traces of stellar wind bow shocks
from OB stars in these data. According to our study, their driving
stars are more likely to be of initial mass M⋆ > 20 M⊙ (Fig. 11a).
This also implies that bow shocks in the ﬁeld that are observed
with such facilities are necessary produced by runaway stars of ini-
tial mass larger than M⋆ > 20 M⊙. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the
models involving an 10 M⊙ star and with v⋆ > 40 km s−1 have
Σmax
[Hα] > 10, whereas almost all of the other simulations
do not satisfy this criterion (Fig. 11b).

[OIII]/Σmax

Furthermore, we ﬁnd a similarity between some of the cross-
sections taken along the symmetry axis of the Hα surface bright-
ness of our bow shock models (Fig. 10) and the measure of the
radial brightness in emission measure of the bow shock generated
by the runaway O star HD 57061 (see ﬁg. 5 of Brown & Bomans

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

2005). This observable and our model authorize a comparison since
Hα emission and emission measures have the same quadratic de-
pendence on the gas number density. The emission measure proﬁle
of HD 57061 slightly increases from the star to the bow shock and
steeply peaks in the region close to the contact discontinuity, be-
fore to decrease close to the forward shock of the bow shock and
reach the ISM background emission. Our Hα proﬁle with φ = 60◦
is consistent with (i) the above described variations and (ii) with
the estimate of the inclination of the symmetry axis of HD 57061
with respect to the plane of the sky of about 75◦, see table 3
of Brown & Bomans (2005). Note that according to our simula-
tions, the emission peaks in the region separating the hot from the
cold shocked ISM gas.

Brown & Bomans (2005) extracted a subset of 8 bow shocks
at Hα from the catalogue compiled by van Buren et al. (1995).
The bow shocks of the stars HD149757 and HD158186 do
not match any of our models. The O6.5V star HD17505 mov-
ing in a medium with nISM ≈ 21 cm−3 is also uncompati-
ble with the space of parameter covered by our study. The cir-
cumstellar nebulae of HD92206 (R(0) ≈ 3.67 pc, nISM ≈
0.007 cm−3, v⋆ ≈ 40.5 km s−1) and HD135240 (R(0) ≈
3.50 pc, nISM ≈ 0.21 cm−3, v⋆ ≈ 32.5 km s−1) have some of
their properties similar to our models MS2040n0.01/MS2070n0.01
(R(0) ≈ 7.80-3.80 pc, nISM = 0.01 cm−3, v⋆ = 40-70 km s−1)
and MS2020n0.1/MS2040n0.1 (R(0) ≈ 3.51-2.02 pc, nISM =
0.1 cm−3, v⋆ = 20-40 km s−1) but do not properly ﬁt them. The
bow shock of HD57061 (R(0) ≈ 7.56 pc, nISM ≈ 0.07 cm−3,
v⋆ ≈ 55.8 km s−1) matches particularly our model MS2040 with
R(0) ≈ 7.8 pc, nISM = 0.01 cm−3 and v⋆ = 40 km s−1, and
therefore constitute a good candidate for future tailored numeri-
cal simulations. More detailed simulations and subsequent post-
processing of the corresponding data, e.g. including the effects of
the extinction of the ISM on the infrared emission are necessary for
a more detailed discussion of these results.

4.3.4 Implication for the evolution of supernova remnants

generated by massive runaway stars

Massive stars evolve and die as supernovae, a sudden and strong
release of matter, energy and momentum taking place inside the
ISM pre-shaped by their past stellar evolution (Langer 2012). In
the case of a runaway progenitor, the circumstellar medium at the
pre-supernova phase can be a bow shock nebula with which the
shock wave interacts before expanding further into the unperturbed
ISM (Brighenti & D’Ercole 1994). The subsequent growing super-
nova remnant develops asymmetries since it is braked by the mass
at the apex of the bow shock but expands freely in the cavity driven
by the star in the opposite direction (Borkowski et al. 1992). If the
progenitor is slightly supersonic, the bow shock is mainly shaped
during the main-sequence phase of the star; whereas if the progen-
itor is a fast-moving star then the bow shock is essentially made
of material from the last pre-supernova evolutionary phase. In the
Galactic plane (nISM = 0.79 cm−3) such asymmetries arise if the
apex of the bow shock accumulates at least 1.5 M⊙ of shocked ma-
terial (Meyer et al. 2015).

In Fig. 12 we present the mass trapped into the z > 0 region of
our bow shock models as a function of their volume. As in Fig. 11
the ﬁgure distinguishes the initial mass and the ambient medium
density of each models. Amongst our bow shock simulations, 9
models have Mbow & 1.5 M⊙ and 4 of them are generated by the
runaway stars which asymmetric supernova remnant studied in de-
tail in Meyer et al. (2015). The other models with v⋆ 6 40 km s−1
may produce asymmetric remnants because they will explode in-
side their main-sequence wind bubble. The model MS4070n0.1
has v⋆ = 70 km s−1 which indicates that the main-sequence bow
shock will be advected downstream by the rapid stellar motion and
the surroundings of the progenitor at the pre-supernova phase is
made of, e.g. red supergiant material. Consequently, its shock wave
may be unaffected by the presence of the circumstellar medium.
We leave the examination via hydrodynamical simulations of this
conjecture for future works. Interestingly, we notice that most of
the potential progenitors of asymmetric supernova remnants are
moving in a low density medium nISM 6 0.1 cm−3, i. e. in the
rather high latitude regions of the Milky Way. This is consistent
with the interpretation of the elongated shape of, e.g. Kepler’s su-
pernova remnant as the consequence of the presence of a mas-
sive bow shock at the time of the explosion (Vel´azquez et al. 2006;
Toledo-Roy et al. 2014).

4.3.5 The inﬂuence of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld on the shape

of supernovae remnants

An alternative explanation for the asymmetrical shape of super-
nova remnants can be found in the inﬂuence of the interstellar
magnetic ﬁeld. Although the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld does not
inﬂuence the shape of an expanding supernova blast wave di-
rectly (Manchester 1987) it can inﬂuence the shape and size of the
wind-blown bubble, as suggested by Arnal (1992) and shown nu-
merically by van Marle et al. (2015). Such magnetic ﬁelds slow the
expansion of the wind-blown bubble in the direction perpendicular
to the direction of the ﬁeld and, depending on the ﬁeld strength can
stop the expansion in that direction completely. The end result is
an elongated, ellipsoid bubble, which in turn, would inﬂuence the
expansion of the supernova remnant.

As shown by van Marle et al. (2015), the interstellar mag-
netic ﬁeld would have to be fairly strong (beyond about 20 µG)
to enable it to constrain the wind-bubble sufﬁciently that the

Figure 12. Bow shocks mass as a function of the bow shock volume. The
ﬁgure shows the mass Mbow (in M⊙) trapped in the z > 0 region of the
bow shock as a function of its volume R(0)3 (in pc3). The dots distin-
guish between models (i) as a function of the ISM ambient medium with
nISM = 0.01 (triangles), 0.1 (diamonds), 0.79 (circles) and 10 cm−3
(squares), and (ii) as a function of the initial mass of the star with 10 (blue
dots), 20 (red plus signs) and 40 M⊙ (green crosses). The thin horizontal
black line corresponds to Mbow = 1.5 M⊙, i.e. the condition to produce
an asymmetric supernova remnant if nISM = 0.79 cm−3 (Meyer et al.
2015).

scale of the bubble would be reduced to that of a bow shock.
However, such ﬁeld-strengths are not unreasonable as ﬁeld
strengths of up to 60 µG, have been observed in the galactic
core (Rand & Kulkarni 1989; Ohno & Shibata 1993; Frick et al.
2001; Opher et al. 2009; Shabala et al. 2010; Fletcher et al. 2011;
Heerikhuisen & Pogorelov 2011; Vall´ee 2011) and ﬁelds that are
stronger than that by an order of magnitude can be found inside
molecular clouds (Crutcher et al. 1999).

There are two tests that can be used to distinguish whether
the bubble into which a supernova remnant expands has been con-
strained by stellar motion, or by an interstellar magnetic ﬁeld. One:
the magnetic ﬁeld in the galaxy tends to be aligned with the spiral
arms. Gaensler (1998) showed that supernova remnants tend to be
aligned with the galactic disk. This would seem to support the the-
ory that it is the magnetic ﬁeld, rather than a bow shock, that con-
strained the wind expansion. However, the correlation is not very
strong. Two: the shape of the supernova remnant itself. Van Marle
(2015) showed that a supernova remnant, expanding inside a mag-
netically constrained bubble, ﬁrst collides with the outer edge along
the minor axis of the ellipsoid bubble, while, in the direction along
the major axis the expansion can continue uninterrupted. This pro-
duces a barrel-like supernova remnant. When expanding inside a
bow shock, the collision would ﬁrst occur at the front of the bow
shock, creating a parabolic shape with free expansion only possible
along the tail of the bow shock.

5 CONCLUSION

Our bow shock simulations indicate that no structural difference
arise when changing the density of the background ISM in which
the stars move, i.e. their internal organisation is similar as described
in Comer´on & Kaper (1998) and Paper I. The same is true for their
radiative properties, governed by line cooling such as the [OIII]
λ 5007 line and showing faint Hα emission, both principally orig-
inating from outer region of shocked ISM gas. We also ﬁnd that

their X-rays signature is fainter by several orders of magnitude than
their Hα emission, and, consequently, it is not a good waveband to
search for such structures.

starlight

The best way to observe bow shocks remains their in-
frared emission of
reprocessed by shocked ISM
dust (Meyer et al. 2014). We ﬁnd that the brightest infrared bow
shocks, i.e. the most easily observable ones, are produced by high-
mass (M⋆ ≈ 40 M⊙) stars moving with a slow velocity (v⋆ ≈
20 km s−1) in the relatively dense regions (nISM ≈ 10 cm−3) of
the ISM, whereas the brightest Hα structures are produced by these
stars when moving rapidly (v⋆ ≈ 70 km s−1). Thin-shelled bow
shocks have mid-infrared luminosities which does not report the
time-variations of their unstable structures. This indicates that spec-
tral energy distributions of stellar wind bow shocks are the appro-
priate tool to analyze them since they do not depend on the tempo-
rary effects that affect their density ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that bow shocks
from Galactic runaway stars have emission peaking in the wave-
length range 3 6 λ 6 50 µm. Interestingly, the circumstellar
material can be up to several oders of magnitude brighter than the
star and dominates the emission, especially if M⋆ > 20 M⊙.

A detailed analysis of our grid of simulations indicates that
the Hα surface brightness of Galactic stellar wind bow shocks in-
creases if their angle of inclination with respect to the plane of
the sky increases up to φ = 60◦, however, edge-on viewed bow
shocks are particularly faint. We ﬁnd that all bow shocks gen-
erated by a 40 M⊙ ZAMS runaway star could be observed with
Rayleigh-sensitive Hα facilities and that bow shocks observed in
the ﬁeld by means of these facilities should have an initial mass
larger than about 20 M⊙. Furthermore, all of our bow shocks gen-
erated by a 10 M⊙ ZAMS star moving with v⋆ > 40 km s−1 have
a line ratio Σmax
[Hα] > 10. Our study suggests that slowly-
moving stars of ZAMS mass M⋆ > 20 M⊙ moving in a medium
of nISM > 0.1 cm−3 generate massive bow shocks, i.e. are suscep-
tible to induce asymmetries in their subsequent supernova shock
wave. This study will be enlarged, e.g. estimating observability of
red supergiant stars.
