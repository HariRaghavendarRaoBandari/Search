Qualitative stability of nonlinear networked

systems

Marco Tulio Angulo and Jean-Jacques Slotine

Abstract—In many large systems, such as those encountered in
biology or economics, the dynamics are nonlinear and are only
known very coarsely. It is often the case, however, that the signs
(excitation or inhibition) of individual interactions are known.
This paper extends to nonlinear systems the classical criteria
of linear sign stability introduced in the 70’s, yielding simple
sufﬁcient conditions to determine stability using only the sign
patterns of the interactions.

Index Terms—nonlinear system, networks, stability.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is challenging to determine the stability of large complex
systems —such as gene regulation networks, ecological sys-
tems and economic markets— not only because of their size,
but because in practice we only know their dynamics very
coarsely. Our knowledge of these large complex systems is
often limited to the interaction network between the system’s
components (nodes) and the sign-pattern of the network [1]. In
gene regulation systems, for instance, we know the complete
list of genes —the nodes of the network— and the signs of
their interactions —positive interactions are activations and
negative ones inhibitions [2, 3]. Yet, since the edge-weights
and dynamic model associated to these networks are unknown,
this provides “qualitative” information of the system only.

The classical sign-stability criterion introduced in the 70’s
opened the door to study the qualitative stability of linear sys-
tems, requiring to know only the sign-pattern of their intercon-
nection network in order to conclude stability [4, 5]. Its impact
was profound in diverse ﬁelds including ecology [6], economy
[7], and more recently control [8] and network science [9].
However, the classical sign-stability criterion cannot be applied
to nonlinear phenomena such as oscillations, bistability, chaos
and so on that often appear in engineering, biological and
economic systems [10]. For nonlinear systems, stability is
preserved under cascade (i.e., series) interconnections under
quite general conditions [11, 12]. Small-gain conditions have
also been proposed to understand the stability of nonlinear
systems with particular interconnection networks [13, 14], but
these conditions are not completely qualitative as we need to
establish the small-gain property of the nodal dynamics. Thus,
a qualitative stability criterion for nonlinear systems beyond
the “cascade of stable systems is stable” is lacking.

In this note, we use contraction theory [15] in order to
extend the sign-stability criterion to nonlinear systems. Re-
markably, almost the same conditions as in the linear sign-
stability criterion imply stability in nonlinear systems. Indeed,

the conditions for sign-stability of linear and nonlinear systems
are identical if the “asymmetries” of the system are constant.
Otherwise it becomes necessary that the intrinsic stability of
isolated nodes is sufﬁciently strong. The rest of the note is
organized as follows. Section II presents the problem statement
and our main results, which are proved in Section III. Section
IV extends our nonlinear sign-stability criterion to delayed
interconnections and modules (i.e., sets of nodes), and presents
a discussion on the conditions for stability. Section V contains
some concluding remarks.

II. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND MAIN RESULTS

Consider a system composed of n nodes where the scalar
xi(t) denotes the state of node i at time t. The state of a
node may represent the abundance of certain specie in an
ecological system, or the expression level of some gene in
a gene regulatory network, and so on. Suppose we are given
a directed network G = (V, E) associated to the system with
vertex set V = {x1,··· , xn} and edge set E. An edge xj → xi
in the network corresponds to a direct inﬂuence of xj on xi.
We are also given the “sign” of each edge in the network,
associating positive sign to “activation” and negative sign to
“repression”.
Our objective is to characterize sufﬁcient conditions for the
stability of the system from the knowledge of G. To address
this problem, let us assume that the system dynamics satisfy
the differential equations

i = 1,··· , n,

˙xi = fi(x1,··· , xn, t),

(1)
for some smooth functions fi(x, t) : Rn × R+ → R, x =
(x1,··· , xn)
(cid:124). We might not know these functions exactly,
but we assume we know some of their structure as precised
later on.
Under model (1), the edge xj → xi exists in G if and only if
the function aij(x, t) = ∂fi(x, t)/∂xj is not identically zero.
Similarly, this edge is positive if aij(x, t) > 0 and negative
if aij(x, t) < 0 [3]. In general, the sign of aij(x, t) changes
with time but this will not introduce any conceptual difﬁculty
to our analysis. In particular, when the functions fi(x, t) are
time invariant and monotone in x —as in most models of gene
regulation— the sign of aij(x, t) remains constant.

We use the following notion of stability [15]:

Deﬁnition 1. System (1) is contracting if for any two initial
conditions their corresponding trajectories converge exponen-
tially fast towards each other.

A contracting system forgets exponentially fast its initial
condition converging towards a unique trajectory. In contrast to
Lyapunov stability, such limiting trajectory is not necessarily
constant (i.e., an equilibrium). Historically, basic convergence
results on contracting systems can be traced back to [16] using
Finsler metrics, and also to [17, 18] and [19].

Our main result is:

Theorem 1. System (1) is contracting provided that:
(i) Reciprocate interactions have opposite signs: if xi →
xj and xj → xi are edges in the network, i (cid:54)= j,

then aji(x, t) = −bij(x, t)aij(x, t) for some function
bij(x, t) > 0.

(ii) Self-loops are negative and strong enough to overcome
the logarithmic derivative of the asymmetries: there exists
functions αi(x, t) > 0 such that aii(x, t) = −αi(x, t) and

(cid:88)

j∈Ni

αi(x, t) >

1
2

˙bij(x, t)
bij(x, t)

,

i = 1,··· , n,

where Ni is the set of feedback neighbors of node i.

(iii) G does not contain cycles of length 3 or more.
Corollary 1. Suppose that the asymmetries bij > 0 are con-
stant (i.e., reciprocate interactions have the same functional
form). Then (1) is contracting if aii(x, t) < 0 and G does not
have cycles of length 3 or more.

We say that (1) is sign-stable if it satisﬁes the conditions of
Theorem 1. When these conditions hold in a region Ω ⊆ Rn
only, we say that (1) is sign-stable in Ω. The functions
bij(x, t) in condition (i) represent the asymmetry between the
edges involved in a negative feedback loop, Fig.1a. Corollary
the sign-stability conditions for linear and
1 implies that
nonlinear systems are identical
if the asymmetries in the
system are constant. When the asymmetries are not constant,
condition (ii) requires that the intrinsic stability of the nodes
(represented by their contraction rates αi(x, t) > 0) dominates
their logarithmic derivative. This condition of sufﬁciently large
contraction rates of the isolated nodes turns out to be necessary
for contraction with time-varying asymmetries, and it can also
be stated in terms of how “fast” the asymmetry needs to be
(Section IV-B). The feedback neighbors Ni of node xi is the
set of nodes xj such that the edges xi → xj and xj → xi exist.
A cycle in G is a sequence of edges (excluding self loops) that
starts and ends in the same node, and its length is the number
of edges it contains. For example {xi → xj, xj → xk, xk → xi}
with i (cid:54)= j (cid:54)= k is a cycle of length 3. Condition (iii) is related
to the fact that systems with cycles of length 3 require speciﬁc
tuning of their edge-weights to be stable. In the case of linear
systems with n = 3, this can be seen from the root-locus
diagram: there are three branches and, by symmetry, at least
one branch crosses to the right half-plane of the complex plane.
Consequently, the stability depends on the edge-weights of the
network and we cannot determine stability based on its signs
only. In Section IV we extend Theorem 1 to time-delayed
interconnections, and to interconnections of modules instead
of nodes. When the functions fi are linear and time invariant,
our result reduces to the classical sign-stability criterion [4, 5].
Example 1: Applying Corollary 1, the system ˙x1 = −x1 −
2 − x3 is sign-stable in the
x1x2, ˙x2 = x2
region Ω = {x ∈ R3|x2 > −1, x3 > −1}. Indeed, it satisﬁes
condition (i) with b12 = b23 = 2, and condition (ii) because
a11 = −1−x2 < 0, a22 = −1−x3 < 0, a33 = −1. Condition
(iii) is satisﬁed because its associated network does not have
cycles of length 3 or more, Fig.1b. Furthermore, the origin
x ≡ 0 is exponentially stable since it is a trajectory in Ω.

1 − x2 − x2x3, ˙x3 = x2

Our proof of the main result is based on two observations.
First, the network of a sign-stable system is composed of
cascades of what we call “feedback chains” (Proposition 2).

2

Feedback chains are systems recursively built using negative
feedback interconnections under the constraint that they do
not have cycles of length 3 or more. Second, feedback chains
are contracting provided that their nodes, when isolated, have
a large enough contraction rate to dominate the logarithmic
derivative of the asymmetry of the system (Proposition 1).
From these two observations, the proof of Theorem 1 follows
directly, because the cascade interconnection of contracting
systems remains contracting [15].

III. PROOF OF THE MAIN RESULT

A. Contraction theory, and its tools to prove stability.

∂x

Let f = (f1,··· , fn)

the network G. Hereafter, we often omit

(cid:124) allowing us to rewrite (1) as
˙x = f (x, t). Denote its Jacobian by A(x, t) = ∂f (x,t)
,
and note its (i, j) entry is the function aij(x, t) used earlier
to construct
the
arguments of the functions to improve readability unless
they are relevant for the discussion. Contraction theory uses
the fact that exponential stability of the differential system
˙δx(t) = A(x, t)δx(t) implies that system (1) is contracting
[15]. In order to prove contraction, a necessary and sufﬁcient
condition is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix M (t, x) such
that

L(A, M ) = ˙M + A

(cid:124)

M + M A ≺ 0.

(2)

The matrix M introduces a metric in the differential coordi-
nates, and we say that the system is diagonally contracting if
M in (2) can be taken diagonal. Changes of coordinates are
also useful, as illustrated in Example 4.

B. Feedback chains, and their diagonal contraction proper-
ties.

The basic building block for our analysis will be the
negative feedback interconnection for n = 2 nodes shown in
Fig.1a. Its corresponding Jacobian is

(cid:18) −α1

(cid:19)

A12 =

a12
−b12a12 −α2

,

(3)

with αi(x, t) > 0 and b12(x, t) > 0. The particular structure
of (3) suggests using the diagonal metric D12 = diag{b12, 1}
to prove contraction:

(cid:18)−2α1b12 + ˙b12

0

(cid:19)

0
−2α2

L(A12, D12) =

which will be uniformly negative-deﬁnite if

α1 > 0.5 ˙b12/b12, α2 > 0.

Hence a negative feedback interconnection between two nodes
is contracting provided that condition (ii) holds. In this case
not only the metric D12 is diagonal, but also L(A12, D12) is
diagonal. This property will be instrumental in order to extend
this result to more general feedback interconnections, which
we call “feedback chains”. For linear systems, the diagonal
stability of systems with the structure (3) is consequence of the
so-called Schwarz form [20]. Here contraction theory naturally
extends this property to nonlinear systems.

3

Fig. 1. Two-node negative feedback interconnection, and some examples of negative feedback chains. In all networks shown, the sign of aij may
change with time because it is a function of x(t) and t. Hence, the different edge representation for pairs of activation “→” and inhibition “(cid:97)” indicates that
aij and bij aij have opposite signs at each time instant. All nodes have negative self-loops aii = −αi < 0, which are omitted when a network is displayed
in order to improve readability.

The systems shown from Fig.1c to Fig.1e are other examples
of negative feedback interconnections. Their linear versions
are no longer Schwarz forms of any order, so we call them
feedback chains. Feedback chains are recursively built starting
from a negative feedback interconnection between two nodes,
and adding new nodes by interconnecting each one of them to
a single existing node using negative feedback (i.e., reciprocate
interactions with bij > 0). By their construction, feedback
chains do not contain cycles of length 3 or more.
Example 2: Consider Fig.1c and let A123 denote its Jacobian

 −α1

A123 =

If condition (ii) holds, the ﬁrst cycle {x1, x2} is contracting
with metric D12 = diag{b12, 1}; similarly, the second one
{x2, x3} is contracting with metric D23 = diag{1, b32}.
We naturally combine both metrics D123 = diag{b12, 1, b32}
obtaining

L(A123, D123) =

proving that
the system corresponding to Fig.1c is con-
tracting provided that node x3 satisﬁes condition (ii). Here
L(A123, D123) is again diagonal, and recursively depends on
L(A12, D12). The system in Fig. 1b. can be similarly analyzed
deﬁning a32 = −b23a23 and b32 = b−1
23 .
Now consider network Fig.1d obtained by adding the node
x4 to the feedback chain of Fig.1c. For subsystem A123 we
have the metric D123, and for the subsystem A24 we have the
metric D24 = diag{1, b42}. Naturally combining both metrics
D1234 = diag{b12, 1, b32, b42} we obtain

which is again diagonal and proves that the system correspond-
ing to network Fig.1d is contracting if it satisﬁes condition (ii).
The above example show how to recursively build diagonal
metrics to prove contraction of feedback chains, illustrating
the following result.
Proposition 1. Provided that nodes satisfy condition (ii), a
negative feedback chain is diagonally contracting.

Proof: We prove the claim by induction on the dimension
of the chain. Let Σi denote a feedback chain of dimension i

and Ai its Jacobian. We have shown that Σ2 (i.e., two-node
negative feedback) is diagonally contracting: there exists a
diagonal metric D2 such that L(A2, D2) ≺ 0. Furthermore,
L(A2, D2) is also diagonal.
is diagonally contracting and
L(Ai, Di) ≺ 0 is diagonal. Let xi+1 be the new added node.
By relabeling the nodes in Σi, we assume that xi+1 will
be connected to xi without loss of generality. Therefore the
Jacobian of Σi+1 is

Now suppose that that Σi

where ei = (0,··· , 0, 1) ∈ Ri. Here we have used ai+1
and bi+1 instead of ai+1,i and bi+1,i to simplify the notation.
As noted in Example 2, we may rewrite the Jacobian using
ai,i+1 = −bi+1,iai+1,i and bi,i+1 = b−1
i+1,i so the expression
(4) can be considered without loss of generality. Based on

Negative feedbackNegative feedback chainsa.b.c.d.e.Despite it is possible to prove Proposition 1 without using
recursion, the above proof is more natural from the point of
view of a growing network, building larger metrics based
on existing smaller ones. This recursive method will also
be useful
to extend the sign-stability criterion to delayed
interconnections and modules (Section IV).

C. The network structure of sign-stable systems.

To conclude the proof of the main result, we show that
when G does not contain cycles of length 3 or more —that
is, condition (iii) holds— then the network is composed of
cascades of feedback chains. We start showing that feedback
chains are the minimal building blocks of networks with
such constraint, and then we characterize how to interconnect
feedback chains while keeping this constraint.
Lemma 1. Adding a new edge to a feedback chain produces
a cycle of length 3 or more.

Proof: By construction, a feedback chain is strongly
connected (i.e., there is a direct path between any two nodes)
and there is no cycle of length 3 or more. Now suppose we
add a new edge xj → xi. Yet, there is already a path in the
network from xi to xj and since the edge is new, the length of
this path should be 2 at least. Hence the cycle obtained by the
new edge and the already present path has length 3 or more.

Lemma 2. Two feedback chains can be interconnected without
creating a cycle of length 3 or more only by (i) a two-node
feedback (so both feedback chains are merged into a larger
one), or (ii) in cascade.

Proof: (i) If we interconnect two chains by a feedback
we create a larger feedback chain, see Fig.2a. Lemma 1 shows
that adding another edge to this network creates a cycle of
length 3 or more, Fig.2b. (ii) Consider an edge going from
chain Σa to chain Σb and suppose there is an another edge
going from Σb to Σa. This creates a cycle of length 3 or
more, because each feedback chain is strongly connected (see
Fig.2d). Consequently, edges can only go from one feedback
chain to the other, Fig.2c.
Proposition 2. Under conditions (i) and (iii), the network G
of the system is a cascade of negative feedback chains.

The proof of Proposition 2 is a direct consequence of
Lemma 1 and 2. Figure 2a-2d illustrates these lemmas. To-
gether with Proposition 1, Proposition 2 completes the proof
of Theorem 1 because the cascade of contracting systems is
contracting [15]. Corollary 1 follows from Theorem 1 because
if bij is constant then its logarithmic derivative is zero.

IV. DISCUSSION AND EXTENSIONS

A. Delayed interconnections.

Delays in interconnections happen in natural and tech-
nological systems. Here we remark that for systems with
uniformly bounded interactions, there exists a critical threshold

not create cycles of length > 2, merging together two chains into a larger one
(Lemma 2-i). b. Adding any edge to a feedback chain always create cycles
of length > 2 (Lemma 1). c. Interconnecting two feedback chains in cascade
does not create cycles of length > 2 (Lemma 2-ii). d. If the interconnection
between two feedback chains have different directions and are not feedback
to the same node, they necessarily create a cycle with length > 2 (Lemma
2-ii).

for the contraction rates of the nodes such that the system is
contracting for any value of delay.

nection with delays T1, T2 ≥ 0, which corresponds to the
following differential system

Consequently, if the contraction rates of the isolated nodes
satisfy

α1 > (0.5˙b12 + Γ)/b12, α2 > Γ,

(6)

then the system is contracting. In general, the bound Γ may
increase with the state. However, when the interconnection

valid edgea.c.d.b.edge creates cycle withlength > 2functions are independent of the state (e.g.,
time varying
functions), condition (6) is sufﬁcient to ensure contraction for
any value of the delays. Indeed, in the case of linear time-
invariant systems, the characteristic equation of the system is

1 + L(s) = 1 +

a12b12e−s(T1+T2)
(s + α1)(s + α2)

where s ∈ C is the Laplace variable. Observing that for
any given Γ ≥ 0 there exists constant α1, α2 > 0 such
that |L(ıω)| < 1 for all T1, T2 ≥ 0, the Nyquist criterion
immediately implies that the system is stable for any delay.

the cross terms by sums of squares. Finally we add Vi:k =

squared terms without delays. Note this is not restricted to the
particular network structure of sign-stable systems.

B. Time-varying asymmetries need large enough contraction
rates.

The linear sign-stability criterion [4, 5] and the nonlinear
criterion with constant asymmetries (Corollary 1) do not
require the “large enough” contraction rate condition for αi
—condition (ii) of Theorem 1— which may be difﬁcult to
establish in practice. In this sense, both criteria are purely
qualitative (despite its necessary to establish linearity or con-
stant asymmetries in advance). Nevertheless, even in the linear
case, the condition of large enough contraction rates turns out
to be necessary when the asymmetries are time-varying. This
condition can also be expressed in terms of how “fast” the
asymmetries need to be. We illustrate these two statements
using the following example.
Example 4: Consider a linear time-varying instance of the two-
node negative feedback interconnection (3), using α1 = α2 =
α =const., a12 = 1 and b12 = b(t) = 1+0.9 sin(t) > 0. Using
numerical simulations, we conclude this system is unstable for
α ≤ 0.05 but stable for α ≥ 0.09, see Fig. 3. In other words, it
is necessary a large enough contraction rate α > 0 for stability.
Next recall from [21, Theorem 2] that
the linear system
˙δx(t) = A(ωt)δx(t) is globally exponentially stable ∀ω > ω∗
for some ﬁnite ω∗ > 0 if there exists T > 0 such that the
A(τ )dτ is uniformly negative deﬁnite for all
t ≥ 0. In order to apply this result, we ﬁrst rewrite our
example in coordinates Θ(t) = diag{1, b(t)−1/2}. In these
coordinates the Jacobian reads F = ΘAΘ−1 + ˙ΘΘ−1, so
we obtain F (t) = diag{−2α,−2α + ˙b(t)/b(t)}. Now we can
compute

the function b12(t) is uniformly bounded from above and
below. Indeed, if b12(t) ≥  > 0 and b12(t) ≤ γ we can
choose any T > (1/2α) ln(γ/). This shows that for any
α > 0, the system is contracting if ω is large enough. In other
words, if the asymmetry is bounded from above and below
and fast enough. In our example with b(ωt) = 1 + 0.9 sin(ωt)
and α = 0.05, the system becomes stable by increasing the
frequency to ω = 1.1.
On the other hand, Theorem 1 also implies that for any given
α > 0 there exists ω∗ > 0 small enough such that the system
remains contracting for any ω < ω∗. Indeed, our example with
α = 0.05 becomes stable by decreasing the frequency of b(ωt)
to ω = 0.5.

the contraction rates of the nodes α ≤ 0.05, but stable if α ≥ 0.09.

By regarding the differential system ˙δx = A(x(t), t)δx as
a linear time-varying system and using the recursive proof
of Proposition 1, it is straightforward to extend the analysis
of the above example to feedback chains and hence to sign-
stable systems. Consequently, time-varying asymmetries do
not detriment stability if they are either slow enough or fast
enough compared to the system dynamics. Biological and
man-made systems often have time scale separations, so we
can exploit them to establish the sign-stability of networked
systems [22, 23]. With the help of singular perturbation
techniques, time scale separations in the nodal dynamics can
be used to apply the sign-stability criterion to slow nodes only.
Importantly, Example 4 implies that a pure qualitative criterion
for the stability of systems with time-varying asymmetries is
impossible.

Consider the negative feedback interconnection between two
modules with states x1 ∈ Rn1 and x2 ∈ Rn2, corresponding
to the following differential system

tracting with metric Mi and that these metrics satisfy the
compatibility condition M1A12 = A12M2. Using the metric
M = blkdiag{b12M1, M2} we obtain

(˙b12/b12)M1 ≺ 0 and L(A22, M2) ≺ 0, in complete analogy
to the scalar case of Section III-B. Consequently, the sign-

dition MiAij = AijMj,∀j ∈ Ni. Without this compatibility
condition, the conditions that each module needs to satisfy
in order to guarantee stability of the whole network are not
local anymore (i.e., do not depend on the module’s feedback
neighbors only) because the block-diagonal structure is lost.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This paper bridges a theoretical gap by extending the
sign-stability criterion to nonlinear systems, providing also
extensions to consider modules and delayed interconnections.
In practice, it is rare that large networked systems are entirely
sign-stable. Rather, the nonlinear sign-stability criterion can
be used to identify portions of the system (i.e., modules) that
are stable by the “topological” design of their interconnection
network [9]. It is also possible to combine the sign-stability
criterion with other interconnections that preserve contraction,
such as “centralized” ones [24]. From an engineering view-
point, our results allow to recursively build large networks
which automatically preserve stability using simple conditions
on times scales, delays and signs of the interconnections.
