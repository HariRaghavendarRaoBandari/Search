We developed the theory of spin dependent transport through a spin-modulator device (so-called
Datta-and-Das spin transistor) in the presence of a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld (dress-
ing ﬁeld). Solving the Schr¨odinger problem for dressed electrons, we demonstrated that the ﬁeld
drastically modiﬁes the spin transport. In particular, the dressing ﬁeld leads to renormalization of
spin-orbit coupling constants that varies conductivity of the spin transistor. The present eﬀect paves
the way for controlling the spin-polarized electron transport with light in prospective spin-optronic
devices.

Introduction.— One of most excited ﬁelds of the mod-
ern condensed-matter physics is the physics of spin-based
electronic devices (spintronics) which is expected to play
a crucial role in the realization of high-performance infor-
mation processing [1–4]. There are various kinds of logic
devices based on spin-polarized electron transport in fer-
romagnets and semiconductors [5–7].
In ferromagnetic
materials, the spin transfer can be manipulated by an
external magnetic ﬁeld. As to semiconductor structures,
their spin properties are eﬀectively controlled with the
spin-orbit interaction. Namely, the Rashba mechanism
of spin-orbit coupling (based on the inversion asymme-
try of nanostructures) and the Dresselhaus mechanism of
spin-orbit coupling (originating from the bulk inversion
asymmetry) allow tuning the spin states of electrons in
semiconductors without external magnetic ﬁelds [8–10].
The concept of semiconductor spin-transfer device
(spin transistor) was put forward by Datta and Das in
their pioneering work [11]. Constructively, Datta-and-
Das spin transistor consists of two magnetized ferromag-
netic electrodes and a semiconductor channel between
them (see Fig. 1).
In this design, the ferromagnetic
electrodes 1 and 3 are used to inject and collect spin-
polarized electrons, whereas the semiconductor area 2
serves to rotate electron spin via the spin-orbit coupling.
As a result, the transmissivity of the spin transistor de-
pends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling in the
semiconductor channel [11–14]. Originally, the spin-orbit
coupling was proposed to be controlled with a gate volt-
age applied to the semiconductor channel [11].
In the
present study, we propose the alternative method of op-
tical control.

It is well-known that light is eﬀective tool to manip-
ulate electronic properties of various quantum systems
in the regime of strong light-matter coupling. Since

the strongly coupled system ”electron + electromag-
netic ﬁeld” should be considered as a whole, the bound
electron-ﬁeld object — ”electron dressed by electromag-
netic ﬁeld” (dressed electron) — became a commonly
used model in modern physics [15, 16].
It has been
demonstrated that a dressing ﬁeld crucially changes
physical properties of conduction electrons in various
condensed-matter structures,
including bulk semicon-
ductors [17–19], quantum wells [20–25], quantum rings
[26, 27], graphene [28–34], etc. Therefore, one can ex-
pect that spintronic devices are strongly aﬀected by a
dressing ﬁeld as well. However, a consistent theory de-
scribing spin transport in electronic devices subjected to
electromagnetic radiation was not elaborated up to now.
Model.— Let us consider a semiconductor channel of
the spin transistor irradiated by a linearly polarized elec-
tromagnetic wave (dressing ﬁeld) propagating perpendic-
ularly to the channel (see Fig. 1). In what follows, we will
be to assume that the temperature, T , is close to zero. As
a consequence, only electrons situated in the close vicin-
ity of the Fermi energy, εF , contribute to conductivity of
the channel. The Hamiltonian of the electrons reads

ˆHe =

1

2ms

(k − eA)2 + α [σ × (k − eA)]z

+ β [σ · (k − eA)] ,

(1)

where ms is the eﬀective electron mass in the semi-
conductor, σ = (σx, σy, σz) is the Pauli matrix vec-
tor, k = (kx, ky) is the electron wave vector, A =
(0, [E/ω] cos ωt) is the vector potential of the wave, ω
is the wave frequency, E is the amplitude of electric ﬁeld
of the wave, α and β are the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling constants, respectively.
In order to
describe the spin transistor, we speciﬁcally consider elec-
trons propagating in the one-dimensional channel along

FIG. 1: (Color online) Sketch of the spin transistor irradiated
with an electromagnetic (EM) wave. Under the applied volt-
age, V , the source ferromagnetic contact 1 injects the spin-
polarized current, j, into the semiconductor channel 2 along
the x axis. The drain ferromagnetic contact 3 collects the
current. The linearly polarized EM wave propagates perpen-
dicularly to the channel and its electric ﬁeld, E, is directed
along the y axis.

the x axis. Therefore, the Hamiltonian (1) can be rewrit-
ten as ˆHe = ˆH0 + ˆHk, where

ˆH0 =

is the Hamiltonian of “bare” electron in the chan-
nel. Solving the nonstationary Schr¨odinger equation,
i∂Ψ0/∂t = ˆH0Ψ0, one can easily obtain the exact eigen-
spinors of the Hamiltonian (2),

(4)

where γ = pα2 + β2 is the eﬀective spin-orbit coupling

constant which takes into account both the Rashba spin-
orbit interaction mechanism and the Dresselhaus one.
Since the eigenspinors (4) form the complete basis of the
considered electron system, we can seek eigenspinors of
the full Hamiltonian ˆHe = ˆH0 + ˆHk as

Ψk(t) = a+(t)Ψ+

0 + a−(t)Ψ−
0 .

(5)

Substituting the expansion (5) into the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion with the full Hamiltonian ˆHe = ˆH0 + ˆHk, we arrive
at the two diﬀerential equations describing the quantum
dynamics of the considered system:

It follows from the Floquet theory of periodically driven
quantum systems [35–37] that the wave function (5) can
be written in the form Ψk(t) = e−i˜εt/Φ(t), where the
function Φ(t) = Φ(t + 2π/ω) periodically depends on
time and ˜ε is the quasi-energy (energy of dressed elec-
tron). Since the quasi-energy plays the same role in pe-
riodically driven quantum systems as the usual energy
in stationary ones, the present analysis is aimed at ﬁnd-
ing the energy spectrum ˜ε(kx) for electrons propagating
through the irradiated semiconductor channel. The peri-
odicity of the function Φ(t) allows seeking the coeﬃcients
a±(t) in Eqs. (6) as the Fourier expansion,

a±(t) = e−i˜εt/

As to the exponents in the right sides of Eqs. (6), they
can be transformed with use of the Jacobi-Anger expan-
−∞ Jn(z)einφ, where Jn(z) is the Bessel
function of the ﬁrst kind.
If the dressing ﬁeld is both
high-frequency and nonresonant, the rapidly oscillating
terms, einωt, make a negligibly small contribution into
the quantum dynamics equations (6). Physically, this is
a general rule for periodically driven quantum systems
(see, e.g., the qualitatively similar analysis for various
dressed nanostructures in Refs. [23–25, 29, 32]). There-
fore, the high-frequency harmonics einωt with n 6= 0 can
be omitted in Eqs. (6). As a consequence, Eqs. (6) can
be reduced to the expression

Solving Eqs. (8), we obtain the energy spectrum of
dressed electrons,

˜ε(kx) =

(9)

where ˜γ = q˜α2 + ˜β2, ˜α and ˜β are the spin-orbit con-

Physically, the quantum dynamics equations (8) exactly
correspond to the stationary Schr¨odinger equation with
the eﬀective Hamiltonian of dressed electrons in the irra-
diated semiconductor channel,

.

(10)

ˆHs =

+ ( ˜βσx − ˜ασy)kx,

(11)

which results in the same energy spectrum (9). It should
be noted that the Hamiltonian of dressed electrons (11)
exactly coincides with the well-known Hamiltonian for
“bare” electrons (3) with the formal replacement α, β →

˜α, ˜β. Consequently, all physical quantities describing
dressed electrons can be easily derived from the “bare”
ones with the same replacement. The energy spectrum of
dressed electrons (9) turns into the well-known spin-split
energy spectrum of “bare” electrons in the absence of the
dressing ﬁeld (E = 0). It should be stressed that the spin-
orbit constants of dressed electrons diﬀer from the same
constants for ”bare” electrons only by the Bessel-function
factor (10) depending on the dressing ﬁeld amplitude E
and the frequency ω. Mathematically, just this factor is
responsible for the optical control of the spin transistor
discussed below.

Spin transport.— In the original proposal

for the
Datta-and-Das spin transistor [11], the semiclassical
model was used. Within this approach, the spin-orbit in-
teraction was treated as an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld which
depends on the electron wave vector along the semicon-
ductor channel, kx, and is perpendicular to the magne-
tization of ferromagnetic contacts. The spin-polarized
electrons injected to the semiconductor channel from the
source ferromagnetic contact are aﬀected by the eﬀective
ﬁeld. As a consequence, the spin of the electrons under-
goes the rotation, whose angle at the drain ferromagnetic
contact is θ = 2msγL/, where L is the length of the
channel. Assuming the semiconductor channel to be in
the ballistic regime, the amplitude of their probability to
enter into the drain is equal to cos θ/2. Controlling the

spin-orbit constant γ =pα2 + β2 with external actions,

one can control the conductance of the spin transistor.
Particularly, it follows from Eq. (10) that the spin-orbit
coupling can be controlled with an irradiation. Perform-
ing the formal replacement, γ → ˜γ, in the known expres-
sions describing the spin transistor [11], we obtain the
semiclassical conductance of the irradiated transistor,

G =(cid:18) e2

(12)

To carry out the full quantum treatment of the spin
transport, let us divide the model structure into the re-
gions 1, 2 and 3, where the regions 1 and 3 correspond to
the ferromagnetic contacts and the region 2 corresponds
to the semiconductor channel (see Fig. 1). The electronic
properties of the irradiated semiconductor region 2 are
described by the Hamiltonian (11), whereas the Hamil-
tonian of ferromagnetic regions 1 and 3 can be written as
ˆHf = ˆp2
x/2mf − σz∆/2, where ˆpx is the operator of elec-
tron momentum along the x axis, mf is the electron eﬀec-
tive mass in the ferromagnetic, and ∆ is the Zeeman spin
splitting of electron states in the ferromagnetic. Then the
spinors describing the spin transistor in the three regions,

ψ1,2,3(x), are given by

transistor, CT , we have to use the conventional continuity
conditions at the borders of the regions [38],

where k(1)

ˆv1ψ1(0) = ˆv2ψ2(0), ˆv2ψ2(L) = ˆv3ψ3(L),

(14)
where ˆv = i[ ˆH, x]/ is the velocity operator in the diﬀer-
ent regions: ˆv1,3 = ˆpx/mf and ˆv2 = ˆpx/ms +( ˜βσx− ˜ασy).
Substituting the transmission amplitude, CT , found from
Eqs. (13)–(14) into the Landauer formula,

G =

e2
h |CT|2,

(15)

we can calculate the quantum conductance of the spin
transistor, G.

Discussion and conclusions.— Discussing the limits of
applicability of the developed theory, we underline that
the considered dressing ﬁeld must not be absorbable by
electrons. The collisional absorption of the ﬁeld by elec-
trons can be neglected since the channel is in the regime
of ballistic transport. As to the optical absorption of
the ﬁeld by electrons, it can be neglected if the ﬁeld
frequency, ω, lies far from resonant electron frequencies
corresponding to interband (intersubband) electron tran-
sitions. Therefore, the frequency ω should be low com-
pared to the characteristic optical frequencies. On the
other hand, ω should be high enough to satisfy the condi-

tion ωτ ≫ 1, where τ ∼ L/p2ε/ms is the characteristic

transit time of electron in the channel. Physically, this
condition means that the dressing ﬁeld experiences mul-
tiple oscillations while an electron ﬂies ballistically from
the source contact 1 to the drain contact 3 (see Fig. 1).
Moreover, the photon energy, ω, must be larger than the

characteristic spin-orbit coupling energy, εso ∼ γ√2msε,

in which case it is safe to neglect the rapidly oscillating
terms in the quantum dynamics equations (6). There-
fore, the dressing ﬁeld must be both high-frequency and
non-resonant.

FIG. 2: (Color online) The quantum conductance of the irra-
diated spin transistor, G, as a function of the irradiation in-
tensity, I, and the length of the semiconductor channel (path
length), L, for the ﬁeld frequency ω = 1 THz, the Fermi en-
ergy εF = 10 meV, the Zeeman splitting in ferromagnetic
contacts ∆ = 40 meV, the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling constants α = β = 2 · 104 m/s, the electron eﬀec-
tive masses mf = me (in the ferromagnetic contacts) and
ms = 0.067me (in the GaAs semiconductor channel), where
me is the mass of free electron.

At low temperatures, the electrons contributing to the
spin transport in the channel are situated at the Fermi
level. Therefore, the energy ε in all expressions above co-
incides with the Fermi energy in the semiconductor chan-
nel, εF . The temperature, T , should be low compared to
both the Fermi energy, εF , and the spin-orbit coupling

energy, εso ∼ γ√2msεF . It should be noted also that the

employing the concept of dressing ﬁeld we assume that
/τϕ < g0 , where τϕ is the characteristic dephasing time,
and g0 = eEγ/ω is the characteristic constant of light-
matter coupling in the semiconductor channel.
In the
considered case of ballistic channel, the dephasing time

the ﬁeld amplitude, E, should be large enough to satisfy

can be estimated as τϕ ∼ τ ∼ L/p2ε/ms. Therefore,
the condition E > ωp2ε/ms/(eγL).

Numerical calculations of the conductance of the irra-
diated spin transistor, G, with use of the semiclassical
Datta-and-Das formula (12) and the quantum Landauer
formula (15) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. The dif-
ference between the quantum and semiclassical results
is due to the multiple electron scattering between the
source and drain contacts, which is not accounted for
within the semiclassical approach. The multiple scat-
tering leads to formation of the standing electron waves
between the contacts, which have the same physical na-
ture as eigenmodes of the Fabry-Perot resonator. As a
consequence, the amplitude of quantum conductance ex-
periences additional modulation (see Fig. 3).

FIG. 3: (Color online) The semiclassical conductance (dashed
line) and quantum conductance (solid line) as a function of
the irradiation intensity, I, for the ﬁeld frequency ω = 1 THz,
the Fermi energy εF = 10 meV, the Zeeman splitting in fer-
romagnetic contacts ∆ = 40 meV, the length of the semi-
conductor channel L = 2.4 µm, the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling constants α = β = 2 ·104 m/s, the electron
eﬀective masses mf = me (in the ferromagnetic contacts) and
ms = 0.067me (in the GaAs semiconductor channel), where
me is the mass of free electron.

The plotted dependence of the conductance, G, on the
irradiation intensity, I, originates from the ﬁeld-induced
modiﬁcation of the spin-orbit coupling constants (10).
Conventionally, only the gate voltage was used before to
tune the constants [14, 39, 40]. In particular, the gate-
controlled scheme of the spin transistor was proposed by
Datta and Das [11]. The present theory indicates that
the spin-orbit coupling can be eﬀectively controlled with
an external optical ﬁeld as well.

To summarize, the strong coupling between electron
spins and a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld is an eﬃ-
cient control tool for the spin precession rate in spin tran-
sistors. Since the dressing ﬁeld renormalizes spin-orbit
coupling constants, the variation of the dressing ﬁeld in-
tensity drastically modiﬁes the spin transport properties
of the transistors. Thus, the predicted eﬀect opens way
to realization of new spin-optronic devices.
