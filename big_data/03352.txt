NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE FREE BOUNDARY

REGULARITY FOR A DEGENERATE ADVECTION-DIFFUSION

PROBLEM

L. MONSAINGEON

Abstract. We study the free boundary regularity of the traveling wave solutions to
a degenerate advection-diﬀusion problem of Porous Medium type, whose existence was
proved in [24]. We set up a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme allowing to compute approximate
solutions and capture the free boundaries, and we carry out a numerical investigation of
their regularity. Based on some nondegeneracy assumptions supported by solid numer-
ical evidence, we prove the Lipschitz regularity of the free boundaries. Our simulations
indicate that this regularity is optimal, and the free boundaries seem to develop Lipschitz
corners at least for some values of the nonlinear diﬀusion exponent. We discuss analyt-
ically the existence of corners in the framework of viscosity solutions to certain periodic
Hamilton-Jacobi equations, whose validity is again supported by numerical evidence.

Consider the standard advection-diﬀusion equation

1. Introduction

∂tT − div(λ∇T ) + V · ∇T = 0,

t ≥ 0, x ∈ Rd,

with unknown temperature T (t, x) ≥ 0, conductivity λ ≥ 0, and prescribed ﬂow V(x) ∈ Rd.
In the context of high temperature hydrodynamics the conductivity cannot be assumed to
be constant as for standard diﬀusion, but should rather be of the form

λ = λ(T ) = λ0T m,

m > 0

for some ﬁxed conductivity exponent and constant λ0 > 0 depending on the model [27].
For example in physics of plasmas, and particularly in the context of Inertial Conﬁnement
Fusion, the dominant mechanism of heat transfer is the so-called electronic Spitzer heat
diﬀusion and corresponds to m = 5/2 (see e.g. [13, 23]). Suitably rescaling time and space
yields the nonlinear parabolic problem

∂tT − ∆(cid:0)T m+1(cid:1) + V · ∇T = 0.

(1.1)
When V ≡ 0 this corresponds to the celebrated the Porous Medium Equation
(PME)

∂tT − ∆(cid:0)T m+1(cid:1) = 0,

which has been widely studied in the literature as the basic example of a degenerate
diﬀusion equation supporting ﬁnite speed of propagation. We refer the reader to the
classical monograph [26] and references therein for an exhaustive bibliography, and to [2, 3,
7] for well-posedness of the Cauchy problem and regularity questions. Writing ∆T m+1 =
div((m + 1)T m∇T ), it is clear that the diﬀusion degenerates at the levelset {T = 0}
whenever m > 0. In this setting it is well known [18, 26] that free boundaries Γ = ∂{T > 0}
separate the “hot” region D+ = {T > 0} from the “cold” one {T = 0}, and propagate with
ﬁnite speed. In order to study the propagation it is more convenient to use the pressure
variable

p =

m + 1

m

T m,

∂tp − mp∆p + V · ∇p = |∇p|2.

which is well deﬁned for physical temperatures T ≥ 0 and formally satisﬁes
(1.2)
Since m > 0 and p ∝ T m, the degeneracy corresponds now to a vanishing “coeﬃcient”
p = 0 along Γ in the diﬀusion term. As for most free boundary scenarios we cannot ex-
pect classical C2 solutions to exist, since gradient discontinuities may and usually do occur
across the free boundaries. A main diﬃculty is therefore to develop a suitable notion of
viscosity and/or weak solutions, see e.g.
[9, 14, 26] and references therein and thereof.
The parametrization, time evolution and regularity of the free boundary for (PME) have
been studied in details in [10, 11, 12], and turns out to be a diﬃcult question. The case of
potential ﬂows V = ∇Φ has been studied in [21], where the authors investigate the long-
time asymptotics of the free boundary for compactly supported solutions with an external
conﬁning potential (Φ(x) ∝ |x|2 at inﬁnity).

In this article we focus on incompressible shear ﬂows in the two dimensional periodic

setting x = (x, y) ∈ D = R × T1, and we consider

V(x, y) =

,

α(y + 1) = α(y),

α(y)dy = 0

for a suﬃciently smooth α (the last condition is just a normalization). Expressed in terms
of the pressure variable, (1.1) reads now in the cylinder

(1.3)

∂tp − mp∆p + α(y)∂xp = |∇p|2,

(t, x, y) ∈ R+ × R × T1.

Looking for traveling wave solutions p(t, x, y) = p(x + ct, y) with speed c > 0 yields the
stationary PDE for the wave proﬁles

(1.4)

− mp∆p + (c + α(y))∂xp = |∇p|2,
and the following existence result was proved in [24]:
Theorem 1. Let c∗ := − min α > 0. For any c > c∗ there exists a continuous (very weak
and viscosity) solution p(x, y) ≥ 0 of (1.4) in the inﬁnite cylinder D = R× Td−1 satisfying
(i) p ∈ C∞(D+) and 0 < ∂xp ≤ c1 in D+ := {p > 0}
(ii) p is globally Lipschitz in D

(x, y) ∈ R × T1,

c > 0, and py(x, y) → 0 uniformly in y when x → +∞

(iii) p is planar and linear at inﬁnity in the direction of propagation p(x, y) ∼ cx, ∂xp(x, y) ∼
(iv) p(x, y) ≡ 0 for x suﬃciently negative
The free boundary Γ = ∂{p > 0} (cid:54)= ∅ can be parametrized as follows: there exists a bounded,
periodic upper semi-continuous interface function I(y) such that

3

p(x, y) > 0 ⇔ x > I(y).

Furthermore,
(a) I is characterized by
(1.5)
(b) If y0 is a continuity point of I then Γ ∩ {y = y0} = (I(y0), y0) × {y0}.
(c) If y0 is a discontinuity point then Γ ∩ {y = y0} = [I(y0),I(y0)] × {y0}, where I(y0) :=

I(y) = inf (x ∈ R,

p(x, y) > 0)

I(y).

y→y0

Let us stress that Theorem 1 was proved in [24] in arbitrary dimensions (x, y) ∈ R×Td−1

(d ≥ 2). These solutions are the exact equivalent of the planar wave solutions

pc(x, y) = c[x]+

for the pure PME (1.2) with V ≡ 0, written here in the steady wave frame x + ct and
deﬁned up to shifts ([.]+ = max{., 0} stands for the positive part). Note that c > 0 means
propagation in the x < 0 direction, and that any speed c > 0 is admissible for the PME
while c > c∗ in Theorem 1. For these PME planar waves the interfaces in the moving
frame are stationary C∞ ﬂat hypersurfaces {x = 0}, up to shifts in the x direction. For
general solutions to the PME, the interfaces tend to become or remain C1,α depending on
the initial regularity, see [10, 11, 12, 19].
Note however that, when α(y) (cid:54)≡ 0, the parametrization function I(y) in Theorem 1 is
only upper semi-continuous. At this stage the free-boundaries may have cusps, and we
cannot exclude discontinuities of I(.) corresponding to horizontal segments [I(y0),I(y0)]×
{y0} ⊂ Γ as in Theorem 1(c). Due to the presence of the advection term, the by-now
classical monotonicity techniques from [1, 8] do not immediately apply, and the purpose of
this article is to investigate numerically (in dimension d = 2) the free boundary regularity
missing so far in Theorem 1.

Using a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, we construct approximate solutions in truncated cylin-
ders with suitable boundary conditions and track the free boundaries. The simulations
indicate that the solutions tend to grow linearly across the interface in the direction of prop-
agation x, which is a strong nondegenerate behaviour and will be crucial in the subsequent
analysis. Assuming this nondegeneracy, and under an additional regularity hypothesis, we
will prove rigorously that the interface parametrization I(y) is Lipschitz continuous, solves
a certain periodic Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the form

(1.6)

|∇yI|2 = g(y),

y ∈ Td−1,

4

L. MONSAINGEON

and the free boundary is therefore the Lipschitz graph Γ = {x = I(y)}. Both assumptions
will be supported by strong numerical evidence. From the theory of periodic Hamilton-
Jacobi equations we expect this Lipschitz regularity to be optimal, and this will be con-
ﬁrmed by our numerical experiments: depending on the value of the diﬀusion exponent, the
interfaces appear to be regular when m > 1, but seem to systematically develop Lipschitz
corners for m ∈ (0, 1). The value m = 1 appears to be a sharp transition, at least in dimen-
sion d = 2, and the very existence of corners is somewhat surprising: since our traveling
waves are entire solutions to the parabolic problem (1.1) one could expect smoothing as
t → ∞ and at least to some extent, even though the diﬀusion is degenerate. This is in sharp
contrast with the pure PME: in the original stationary x frame the planar wave solutions
pc(t, x, y) = c[x + ct]+ have of course smooth free boundaries, and for compactly supported
initial data it is known [17, 22, 26] that the free boundaries become (spherical) C∞ hyper-
surfaces |x| ≈ Ctβ asymptotically as t → ∞ for some scaling exponent β ≡ β(m, d) > 0.
In order to base here the existence of corners on more solid grounds than the mere ob-
servation of corner-looking points in 2D plots obtained from simulations, we shall use in
this paper the framework of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Indeed the classical theory for
viscosity solutions [5, 14, 20, 25] tells us that the regularity of I(y) in (1.6) is essentially
related to the number of zeros of the right-hand side g(y) in the torus. This more tractable
condition can be checked numerically, and will conﬁrm the existence of corners in a more
analytical context.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we introduce the discrete scheme, prove
its positivity (Lemma 1), and highlight the numerical convergence in slowly drifting frames.
Section 3 contains the investigation of the nondegeneracy, based on numerical evidence.
Our main regularity result (Theorem 2) is proved in section 4, which also contains the
numerical validations as well as the interpretation in the framework of Hamilton-Jacobi
equations.

2. Numerical scheme

For the sake of simplicity we shall only consider the following three ﬂows

α1(y) := 0.5 sin(2πy), α2(y) := 10(cid:0)y2(1 − y)2 − 1

sin(2kπy)

(cid:1) , α3(y) := 1

in our computations. These are all normalized to be mean zero as required above, and
α3(y) is just a truncation of the Fourier expansion of a triangular sawtooth.

In order to approximate the wave proﬁles from Theorem 1 we use a classical idea:
traveling waves are usually attractors for the long-time dynamics of the associated Cauchy
problems. Fixing an admissible propagation speed c > c∗ as in Theorem 1 (namely such
that c + α(y) ≥ c0 > 0) we work in the corresponding left-moving frame x + ct, in which
(1.3) reads

(2.1)

∂tp − mp∆p + [c + α(y)]∂xp = |∇p|2.

5

Starting with some suitable initial datum to be precised below, we expect a long-time
convergence p(t, x, y) → p(x, y) of the Cauchy solution to the stationary wave proﬁle sat-
isfying (1.4). Since there exists a whole continuum of admissible speeds c ∈ (c∗, +∞),
the speed selection by the long-time asymptotics is quite delicate. According to Theo-
rem 1(iii) we know that the stationary wave proﬁle satisﬁes ∂xp ∼ c > 0 when x → +∞,
and roughly speaking the slope at inﬁnity determines the propagation speed. This will
be taken into account by imposing the Neumann boundary conditions ∂xp(t, .) = c “at
inﬁnity”, or, rather, on the right boundary x = Xmax of a large but ﬁnite computational
cylinder (x, y) ∈ [0, Xmax] × T1. This is consistent with the construction in [24], where
the solutions of Theorem 1 were precisely obtained by solving the problem in truncated
cylinders with suitable boundary conditions and letting the length of the cylinders tend to
inﬁnity.

2.1. Time and space discretization. Choosing some large Xmax > 0 and integers
Nx, Ny ∈ N, we work in the ﬁnite domain

and build a logically rectangular mesh (i, j) ∈(cid:74)1, Nx(cid:75) ×(cid:74)1, Ny(cid:75) as in Figure 1. Each cell is

Since the Cauchy problem 1.3 is of course time-dependent, we also choose a large maximal
time T max and time steps

0 = t0 < ... < tn < tn+1 < ... < T N = T max,

dtn = tn+1 − tn.

For each iteration the adaptative time step will be chosen in order to satisfy some Courant-
Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition to be precised shortly. We write as usual

i,j ≈ p(tn, xi, yj),
P n

and the y-periodicity j ≡ j mod (Ny − 1) is used to compute ∂y derivatives on the top and
bottom boundaries j = 1 ≡ Ny. In order to obtain an explicit scheme we approximate the
time derivative by the forward diﬀerence

With this choice of discretization we expect ﬁrst order accuracy in time and space, but we
shall not investigate convergence orders in this work because no explicit solution is known
so far.

7

From Theorem 1(i)-(iii) we know that the stationary solution should, at least qualita-
tively, resemble the classical PME planar wave pc(x, y) = c [x]+ up to translation in the x
direction. We naturally use this proﬁle as an initial condition

p0(x, y) = c [x − τ ]+ (cid:32) P 0

i,j = c [xi − τ ]+ ,
where the shift parameter τ ∈ (0, Xmax) is chosen so that the initial free-boundary Γ0 =
{x = τ} is well within the computational domain (say τ = Xmax/2).
Since we are working in ﬁnite cylinders we also need to prescribe suitable boundary
conditions on the sides x ∈ {0, Xmax}. As stated in Theorem 1(iii) for the theoretical wave
proﬁle, the slope at inﬁnity prescribes the propagation speed as p(x, y) ∼ cx and ∂xp ∼ c
when x → ∞. We consequently impose the Neumann condition on the right boundary

As for the left boundary condition, let us recall that we chose an initial datum p0(x, y) =
c[x−τ ]+ whose free boundary Γ0 = {x = τ > 0} is away from x = 0 at time t = 0 (typically
we use τ = Xmax/2 with Xmax large). Because the free boundaries Γt = ∂{p(t, .) > 0}
should propagate with ﬁnite speed [26] and since the sought solution is stationary in the
wave frame, we reasonably expect that Γt should stay away from x = 0 for later times
t > 0. Thus the left boundary of the domain should therefore never “see” the solution
p(t, 0, y) ≡ 0, and we apply now the homogeneous Dirichlet condition
(2.4)

p(t, 0, y) ≡ 0

A typical computation is shown in ﬁgure 2: the pressure p(t, x, y) evolves according to (1.3)
and the initially ﬂat free boundary adjusts in time.

The ﬁrst expression in the denominator of (2.5) corresponds to the exact optimal CFL
= O(dx2 + dy2) for explicit schemes that one would
condition dt ≤ dtdif f =
get when considering the diﬀusion part ∂tp−mp∆p = 0 in (1.3) as a linear diﬀusion equation

2λ(dx2 + dy2)

dx2dy2

8

L. MONSAINGEON

∂tp−D∆p = 0, with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = mp(t, x, y) and λ = (cid:107)D(cid:107)∞. The second term
in the denominator corresponds to the usual stability condition dt ≤ dtadv = dx/(cid:107)V(cid:107)∞
for the advection part ∂tp = −(c + α(y))∂xp in(2.1) with the upwinding (2.2).
In our
simulations P n
i,j remains of order one at least on the right boundary, thus the diﬀusive
(quadratic) CFL condition takes over the hyperbolic (linear) condition and in practice (2.5)
always selects dtn ≈ dtn
CF L = O(dx2 + dy2). Moreover from our numerical experiments the
quasilinear diﬀusion −mp∆p seems to provide suﬃcient stability and (2.5) seems optimal,
in the sense that the scheme appears to be stable when this CFL condition is enforced,
whereas instabilities started building up when dtn > dtCF L. We do not pretend here to
prove any rigorous stability/convergence results, but rather observe numerical stability
from our computations.

It is worth stressing that (2.1) satisﬁes a comparison principle at the continuous level:
nonnegative initial data should therefore produce nonnegative solutions, and step 3 accord-
ingly prevents numerical errors from producing undesired negative values. This truncation
is actually never performed during the computations, and in fact the scheme is positive:
i,j ≥ 0 as

i,j ≥ 0 and that the time step satisﬁes (2.5). Then P n+1

Typical suﬃcient conditions for the convergence of such parabolic schemes are stability,
consistency, and monotonicity [6, 15]. The positivity Lemma 1 goes of course in the right
direction, but for the sake of simplicity we shall not look any further into the discrete
properties of the scheme.

We implemented Algorithm 1 in Fortran90, and all the simulations presented here were

carried out on dedicated servers at the Institut de Math´ematiques de Toulouse, France.

rameters m = 1.1, α(y) = α1(y), c = 0.6, Xmax = 10, dx = dy = 5.e−3.

2.2. Long-time convergence and slow drift. As just discussed we aim at computing
the stationary wave proﬁle as the long-time asymptotic of the Cauchy solutions in the
wave frame x + ct, and we applied Neumann condition ∂xp(t, Xmax, y) = c on the right
boundary in order to mimic the “slope=speed” behaviour in Theorem 1(ii). However, since
we necessarily compute on ﬁnite domains x ∈ [0, Xmax], there is an inevitable discrepancy
between the numerical paradigm on ﬁnite domains ∂xp(t, Xmax, y) = c and the theoretical
model ∂xp(+∞, y) = c. As a result we cannot really expect any long-time convergence,
even at the continuous level, and the ﬁniteness of the domain will always lead to some
residual error. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 3: we see that (cid:107)∂tp(t, .)(cid:107)L2 → C2 > 0 and
(cid:107)∂tp(t, .)(cid:107)L∞ → C∞ > 0 as t → +∞, compared to the expected ∂tp → 0 for any long-time
convergence.

A natural but heuristic explanation, which we observed from our simulations, is the
following: since the diﬀerence between the numerical and theoretical models comes from
Xmax < +∞, the numerical solution tends to globally shift in the x < 0 direction in order
to drive away from the right boundary and accommodate for the discrepancy. If p(x, y)

denotes the stationary wave proﬁle, this means that we expect the ansatz

p(t, x, y) ≈ p (x + X∗(t), y) .

(2.6)
In order to determine and measure numerically the shift X∗(t) we choose an arbitrary
y0 ∈ T1 and monitor the quantity
(2.7)

˜p(t) := p(t, Xmax, y0),

which can be numerically evaluated. Indeed, this marker should evolve as

(t) = ∂tp(t, Xmax, y0) ≈ ∂xp (Xmax + X∗(t), y0)

d˜p

(t).

Since Xmax is chosen large and X∗(t) increases we expect the aforementioned “slope=speed”
behaviour ∂xp (Xmax + X∗(t), y0) ≈ ∂xp(∞, y0) = c > 0, and the shift X∗(t) can thus be
computed approximately as

dX∗
dt

(t) ≈ 1

(t).

(2.8)
In our computations X∗(t) grows almost linearly in time but very slowly (typical values
were dX∗/dt ≈ O(10−3) over simulated 30 − 100s times), and the solution accordingly
drifts to the left.
The ansatz (2.6) also suggests that one should in fact look for long-time convergence
in the slowly moving frame x + X∗(t), rather than in the ﬁxed computational frame of
reference. In order to do so we observe from (2.6) that

∂tp(t, x, y) ≈ ∂xp(x + X∗(t), y)

(t) ≈ ∂xp(t, x, y)

This explains the previous residual error ∂tp (cid:57) 0 (see again Figure 3), but also implies

(2.9)
This convergence in the slowly drifting frame x + X∗(t) can be checked numerically using
(2.7)-(2.8) to compute the drift dX∗/dt: as shown in ﬁgure 4, the convergence (2.9) seems
to be exponential and conﬁrms our ansatz (2.6), and the scheme should therefore correctly
approximate the stationary wave proﬁles in the long-time regime.

3. Free boundaries and nondegeneracy

As stated in Theorem 1, the free boundary Γ = ∂{p > 0} for the stationary wave proﬁle

can be parametrized in the privileged direction of propagation as

p(x, y) > 0 ⇔ x > I(y),

where I(y) is a periodic upper semi-continuous function. In most free boundary problems,
one expects a gradient discontinuity across the interface, and the free boundary is said to
be nondegenerate if the solution has a nontrivial growth across the interface. This can be
characterized by |∇p|Γ+ (cid:54)= 0, where |∇p|Γ+ stands for the inner limit from the “hot side”,

|∇p|Γ+ := lim
D+→ Γ

(x,y)

|∇p|

whenever this quantity makes sense. At least for the pure PME ∂tp − mp∆p = |∇p2|,
the regularity and propagation properties of the free boundary are strongly related to this
nondegeneracy. To see this one can formally evaluate the equation at the free boundary

12

L. MONSAINGEON

where p vanishes, and get ∂tp = |∇p|2 along Γt = ∂{p(t, .) > 0} in some suitable (viscosity)
sense. This diﬀerential equation tells us that the free boundary moves in the outward
normal direction with speed − ∇p|Γ+
(the hot support {p > 0} invades the cold {p = 0},
which is a remainder of the diﬀusive nature of the model at the interface), thus enlightening
the role of the nondegeneracy.
In [12] it is proved that, if the initial free boundary is
nondegenerate at time t = 0, then it starts to move immediately, never stops afterward,
and remains nondegenerate. The regularity and growth/nondegeneracy are also closely
related to parabolic Harnack inequalities and monotonicity properties, see e.g. [16, 18] and
[1, 8].

(left) and ∂xp(x, y) (right), with parameters m = 1.1, α(y) = α1(y), c = 0.6,
Xmax = 10, and dx = dy = 5.e−3. The time t = 30 is large enough so that
the Cauchy solution has converged to the stationary wave proﬁle.

In the present case α(y) (cid:54)≡ 0 we expect a similar scenario: since we start with an initial
datum p0(x, y) = c[x − τ ]+ whose free boundary is nondegenerate ∂xp0|x=τ + = c > 0, the
free boundary should stay nondegenerate as time evolves (although we do not claim here
to prove this highly non-trivial statement). This persisting gradient discontinuity across
the interface should therefore be well adapted to detect the (moving) free boundary. Since
we are interested in traveling waves, the direction of propagation x naturally plays an
important role. The numerical computations indeed always exhibit a jump of ∂xp across
the free boundary, as illustrated in Figure 5, and therefore, supported by this numerical
evidence, we always assume that all the free boundaries remain nondegenerate. Thus ∂xp
will be a relevant quantity to monitor, and in fact the nondegeneracy ∂xp|Γ ≥ c0 > 0 will
be the key ingredient to prove the Lipschitz regularity in section 4 (see Theorem 2 later on).
xxp = +∞ at
The discontinuity of ∂xp moreover leads to a (positive) Dirac singularity ∂2
Γt, and this blowup is very easy to track numerically in order to detect the free boundary
(recall from Theorem 1 that the solution is C∞ in {p > 0}, hence singularities of ∂2
xxp
can only occur at the interface). Once the free boundary is detected we can compute
numerically ∂xp “at” Γ and check the nondegeneracy. More precisely, we use

Note that this detection procedure only sweeps in space (in the x direction), and can
therefore be used dynamically for any ﬁxed time to detect moving free boundaries Γt =
∂{p(t, .) > 0} for the Cauchy problem (2.1). Due to the numerical diﬀusion smoothing
the gradient discontinuity, ∂xp actually jumps across a small O(dx) numerical boundary
layer where the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations may become inaccurate. This is why we
choose to step s meshes away in the x > 0 direction when computing what should be ∂xp
at the free boundary (step 4). In our experiments the choice s = 5 gave satisfactory results
even for high resolutions dx = dy = 1.e−3. Note also that the approximation ∂xp|Γ+ ≈
Pi0+s+1,j − Pi0+s,j
in step 4 is a forward diﬀerence: the relevant information to compute
∂xp|Γ+ “at the free boundary” should come indeed from the hot side D+ = {p > 0}, here
to the x > I(y) side of the free boundary as in Theorem 1.
A typical result obtained with Algorithm 2 is illustrated in Figure 6: clearly ∂xp jumps
across the interface and stays bounded away from zero in {p > 0}, the solution grows lin-
early in x across Γ, and the interface is thus nondegenerate in the direction of propagation.
Note the apparent boundary layer and numerical diﬀusion in the bottom left image, where
a few meshpoints are visible inside the numerical boundary layer.

4. Interface regularity and corners

In the rest of the paper we consider the general d dimensional case (x, y) ∈ R× Td−1 for

the analysis, but still restrict to d = 2 for the simulations.

in D+ = {p > 0}. Hence for any ε > 0 the levelset Γε = {p = ε} can be parametrized by
the Implicit Functions Theorem as a graph

(x, y) ∈ Γε ⇔ p(x, y) = ε ⇔ x = Xε(y),

y ∈ Td−1

Note that Theorem 2 holds in any dimension d ≥ 2, and that the Hamilton-Jacobi equa-
tion (HJ) is not equivalent to −|∇yI|2 = −g in the viscosity sense (this will be important
later on in section 4.3). Let us ﬁrst comment on our hypotheses H1H2, which will be vali-
dated numerically in the next section 4.2. The ﬁrst assumption H1 is rather technical and
is only needed to retrieve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, but seems reasonable compared to
xyp ≡ 0
the usual PME scenario. Indeed the PME planar wave pc(x, y) = c[x]+ is linear ∂2
in {pc > 0} and trivially satisﬁes (H1), and for more general situations this hypothesis is
consistent with the celebrated Aronson-B´enilan semiconvexity estimate ∆p(t, .) ≥ −λ/t in
the steady frame [2, 26] (giving in particular ∆p ≥ 0 in the wave frame, taking t → ∞
for the stationary wave proﬁle). Assumption H2 is a more fundamental nondegeneracy
condition. It can be viewed as an approximation to the strong nondegeneracy ∂xp|Γ+
> 0
along descending levelsets ε (cid:38) 0, which is consistent with and supported by the numer-
ical results in section 3. A closer look at the proof below will reveal that, regardless of
(H1), this second condition will imply that the free boundary is really the Lipschitz graph
Γ = {x = I(y)}, which so far was not guaranteed by Theorem 1. It is worth stressing that
in [24] we were not able to prove analytically any of the strong statements (H1)(H2), and
this is precisely why we use numerical computations in this paper as an investigation tool.

for Xε is therefore uniformly elliptic for ﬁxed ε > 0.

16

L. MONSAINGEON

By (4.1) with (cid:107)∂yp(cid:107)∞ ≤ C from Theorem 1(ii), we see that (H2) gives Lipschitz bounds

on Xε(.) uniformly in ε. We can therefore assume that

Xε(.) → X0(.)

uniformly in T1

at least for some discrete subsequence, and the limit X0 is also Lipschitz. Hypothesis
H2 implies ∂xp ≥ C > 0 in some right neighborhood of the interface, and this strong
monotonicity condition together with the characterization (1.5) of I(y) immediately imply
that the limit is actually

X0(y) = lim
ε→0

Xε(y) = inf {x ∈ R : p(x, y) > 0} = I(y).

Because I(.) is now Lipschitz we can conclude by continuity that the free boundary Γ =
∂{x > I(y)} is really the graph {x = I(y)}.
In order to establish (HJ), observe that H1-H2 imply convergence −mε/fε(.) → 0
uniformly on T1, and

εH1,ε(y, ζ) → 0,

gε(y) → g(y) =

locally uniformly in (y, ζ) ∈ Td−1 × Rd−1 when ε → 0+. By standard stability theorems
[5, 14] the uniform limit I(y) = X0(y) = lim
Xε(y) is a viscosity solution of the limiting
ε→0
equation H(∇yX0) = g, which is exactly (HJ). Note that this is exactly the classical
construction of viscosity solutions by the vanishing viscosity method (up to the ﬁrst or-
der perturbation εH1,ε(y, ζ) → 0). Since our periodic solution X0(y) = I(y) is globally
Lipschitz on the torus and the Hamiltonian H(ζ) = |ζ|2 is coercive, the results in [25] for
stationary solutions apply and I(y) is semi-concave in any dimension d ≥ 2. The stronger
everywhere left- and right-diﬀerentiability in dimension d = 2 is ﬁnally a direct consequence
(cid:3)
of [20, Theorem 1], or alternatively follows by semiconcavity.
4.2. Numerical validation of hypotheses H1-H2. In Theorem 2 we assumed the reg-
ularity (H1) as well as the nondegeneracy condition (H2) to get the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation (HJ) and the Lipschitz regularity of the free boundary, and we need to validate
numerically those strong assumptions. Since ∂xp > 0 in {p > 0} it is easy to detect the
levelsets by sweeping the numerical solution in the x < 0 direction. More precisely, for
ﬁxed ε > 0 we approximate the ε-levelset Γε = {x = Xε(y)} as
(4.3)

Xε(yj) ≈ xIε(j),

We then compute ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations to ∂2

reasons and since p grows linearly in x across the free boundary, ε > 0 cannot be chosen too
small compared to the mesh size dx, dy in order for the ε-levelset to be consistent. Indeed
if ε is too small the numerical levelset Γε = {x = Xε(y)} ↔ {i = Iε(j)} is eventually
detected by (4.3) inside the O(dx) numerical boundary layer surrounding the actual free
boundary, and the spatial derivatives become inaccurate. This is apparent in Figures 7
and 8 with dx = dy = 5.e−3: numerical oscillations start to develop for the smallest tested
value ε = 1.e−2.
4.3. Existence of corners. According to Theorem 2, the interface parametrization I(y)
is semi-concave as a periodic solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ), of the form

|∇yI|2 = g(y)

in Td−1.

Roughly speaking, semi-concavity means that I has only smooth (C1) minimum points, but
that corner-shaped maximum points are allowed. This semiconcavity comes from the minus
sign in the diﬀusive term −ε m
∂xp ∆yXε for the vanishing viscosity approximation (4.2), or
equivalently from the fact that in the limit ε = 0 we are solving solving +|∇yI|2 = g in the
viscosity sense and not −|∇yI|2 = −g (which in general is not equivalent, see e.g. [14, 5]).

(x, y) close to the free boundary. The parameters are as in Figure 7.

It is well known [4, 5, 25] that the uniqueness and regularity of such periodic solutions
strongly depend on the number of zeros of the right-hand side g(y) in the torus. A necessary
condition for classical C1 solutions to exist is that g(y) should vanish at least twice, in which
case uniqueness fails. If now g(y) vanishes only once, any solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation has nonsmooth semiconcave maximum points (in agreement with Theorem 2),
and the free boundary {x = I(y)} should accordingly develop corners pointing in the
x > 0 direction . Indeed in this case ∇yI can vanish only once at a minimum point (the
unique zero g(y0) = 0), but I has at least one maximum point where the derivative fails
to exist and the equation cannot be satisﬁed pointwise (but in the viscosity sense). As a
consequence we expect minimum points to be regular, whereas maximum points may be
generically corner shaped.
Strangely enough, our simulations indicate that the interface has corners only for diﬀu-
sion exponents m ∈ (0, 1). For m > 1 we could never observe corners, and the interfaces
always looked like regular C1 graphs. This is illustrated in Figure 9, where the same com-
putations are compared for m < 1 and m > 1: corners clearly appear in the ﬁrst case,
whereas the free boundaries look smooth in the latter case. Our computations also sug-
gest that m = 1 is a sharp threshold, at least in dimension d = 2: corners systematically
developed for all tested values up to m < 0.99, and completely disappeared as early as
m ≥ 1.01. We do not have any clue for this phenomenon and cannot explain the threshold
so far.

Deciding qualitatively from numerical computations whether corners appear or not is
a delicate matter, due to the intrinsic subjectivity of any graphical representation: what
appears to be corners in the plots of Figure 9 (left column) may actually reveal to be
smooth when zooming on the supposedly Lipschitz tips. This does not seem to be the

case, but the zooming possibilities are of course limited by the resolution and accuracy of
the computations, hence this criterion is not very satisfactory.
Let us recall at this stage that (HJ) was established in Theorem 2 under the assumptions
(H1)(H2), which were numerically validated in section 4.2. As a consequence we can safely
rely on the Hamilton-Jacobi scenario just discussed to push further the analysis: the forcing
∂xp|Γ+ (y) − 1 in |∇yI|2 = g(y) can be evaluated numerically using Algorithm 2
term g(y) = c+α(y)
to compute (an approximation of) ∂xp|Γ+, and if g does not vanish at a corner-looking
point y∗ ∈ T1 then the free boundary Γ = {x = I(y)} must have a Lipschitz corner there.

20

L. MONSAINGEON

This is illustrated in Figure 10 in a test case: the forcing term is non-negative (as it should
be, since it must equal |∇yI|2 ≥ 0), vanishes only once at the C1 minimum y ≈ 0 ≡ 1 of I,
and is clearly bounded away from zero in a y-neighborhood of the semiconcave corner at
y∗ ≈ 0.5.
