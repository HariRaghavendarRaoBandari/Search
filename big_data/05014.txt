CLUSTER ALGEBRAS AND CATEGORY O FOR REPRESENTATIONS

OF BOREL SUBALGEBRAS OF QUANTUM AFFINE ALGEBRAS

DAVID HERNANDEZ AND BERNARD LECLERC

Abstract. Let O be the category of representations of the Borel subalgebra of a quantum
aﬃne algebra introduced by Jimbo and the ﬁrst author. We show that the Grothendieck
ring of a certain monoidal subcategory of O has the structure of a cluster algebra of inﬁnite
rank, with an initial seed consisting of prefundamental representations. In particular, the
celebrated Baxter relations for the 6-vertex model get interpreted as Fomin-Zelevinsky
mutation relations.

1. Introduction

Let Uq(g) be an untwisted quantum aﬃne algebra (we assume throughout this paper that
q ∈ C∗ is not a root of unity). M. Jimbo and the ﬁrst author introduced [HJ] a category O
of representations of a Borel subalgebra Uq(b) of Uq(g). Finite-dimensional representations
of Uq(g) are objects in this category as well as the inﬁnite-dimensional prefundamental
representations of Uq(b) constructed in [HJ]. They are obtained as asymptotic limits of
Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, which form a family of simple ﬁnite-dimensional representa-
tions of Uq(g). These prefundamental representations, denoted by L+
i,a, are simple
Uq(b)-modules parametrized by a complex number a ∈ C∗ and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where n is the
rank of the underlying ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Such prefundamental represen-

tations were ﬁrst constructed explicitly for g = bsl2 by Bazhanov-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov
[BLZ], for bsl3 by Bazhanov-Hibberd-Khoroshkin [BHK] and for bsln with i = 1 by Kojima

The category O and the prefundamental representations were used by E. Frenkel and the
ﬁrst author [FH] to prove a conjecture of Frenkel-Reshetikhin on the spectra of quantum

integrable systems. Let us recall that the partition function Z of a quantum integrable
system is crucial to understand its physical properties. It may be written in terms of the
eigenvalues λj of the transfer matrix T . Therefore, to compute Z one needs to ﬁnd the
spectrum of T . Baxter tackled this question in his seminal 1971 paper [Ba] for the 6-
vertex and 8-vertex models. He observed moreover that the eigenvalues λj of T have a very
remarkable form

(1.1)

λj = A(z)

Qj (zq2)
Qj(z)

+ D(z)

Qj(zq−2)

Qj(z)

,

where q, z are parameters of the model (quantum and spectral), the functions A(z), D(z) are
universal (in the sense that they are the same for all eigenvalues), and Qj is a polynomial.
The above relation is now called Baxter’s relation (or Baxter’s T Q relation).
In 1998,
Frenkel-Reshetikhin conjectured [FR] that the spectra of more general quantum integrable
systems constructed from a representation V of a quantum aﬃne algebra Uq(g) have a

and V is irreducible of dimension 2.) One of the main steps in the proof of this conjecture
[FH] is to interpret the expected generalized Baxter relations as algebraic identities in
the Grothendieck ring of the category O for Uq(b) (see [H4] for a short overview). For

similar form. (In this framework, the 6-vertex model is the particular case when g = bsl2
example, if g = bsl2 and V is the 2-dimensional simple representation of Uq(g) with q-

1,aq2, one gets the following categorical version of Baxter’s relation

character χq(V ) = Y1,a+Y −1
(1.1):

(1.2)

[V ⊗ L+

1,aq] = [ω1][L+

1,aq−1] + [−ω1][L+

1,aq3].

(Here, [ω1] and [−ω1] denote the classes of certain one-dimensional representations of Uq(b),
see Deﬁnition 3.4 below.)

In another direction, the notion of monoidal categoriﬁcation of cluster algebras was in-
troduced by the authors in [HL1]. The cluster algebra A(Q) attached to a quiver Q is a
commutative Z-algebra with a distinguished set of generators called cluster variables and
obtained inductively via the Fomin-Zelevinsky procedure of mutation [FZ1]. By deﬁni-
tion, the rank of A(Q) is the number of vertices of Q (ﬁnite or inﬁnite). A monoidal
category C is said to be a monoidal categoriﬁcation of A(Q) if there exists a ring isomor-
∼
phism A(Q)
→ K0(C) which induces a bijection between cluster variables and classes of
simple modules which are prime (without non trivial tensor factorization) and real (whose
tensor square is simple). Various examples of monoidal categoriﬁcations have been estab-
lished in terms of quantum aﬃne algebras [HL1, HL3], perverse sheaves on quiver varieties
[N2, KQ, Q], and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras [KKKO1, KKKO2].

In this paper, we propose new monoidal categoriﬁcations of cluster algebras in terms of
the category O of a Borel subalgebra Uq(b) of an untwisted quantum aﬃne algebra Uq(g).
More precisely, in [HL3] we have attached to g a semi-inﬁnite quiver G− and we proved that
the cluster algebra A(G−) is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of a monoidal category
C−
Z of ﬁnite-dimensional representations of Uq(g). Moreover, the classes of the Kirillov-
Reshetikhin modules in C−
Z are the images under this isomorphism of a subset of the cluster
variables. Let Γ be the doubly-inﬁnite quiver corresponding to G−, as deﬁned in [HL3,

§2.1.2]). The main result of this paper (Theorem 4.2) is that the completed cluster alge-
bra A(Γ) attached to this doubly-inﬁnite quiver is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of
a certain monoidal subcategory O+
2Z is generated by ﬁnite-
dimensional representations and positive prefundamental representations whose spectral
parameters satisfy an integrality condition (see below Deﬁnitions 3.8, 4.1 and Proposition
5.16). Moreover, the classes of the positive prefundamental representations form the cluster

2Z of O. This subcategory O+

variables of an initial seed of A(Γ). In particular, when g = bsl2 the counterparts (1.2) of

Baxter’s relations (1.1) get interpreted as instances of Fomin-Zelevinsky mutation relations1.
For general types, the ﬁrst step mutation relations are interpreted as other remarkable rela-
tions in the Grothendieck ring K0(O+) (Formula (6.14)). Along the way we get additional
results: the construction of new asymptotic representations beyond the case of prefunda-
mental representations, a duality result between certain subcategories O+ and O− of O,
and the tensor factorization of arbitrary simple modules of O+ into prime modules when
2Z is a monoidal categoriﬁcation

g =bsl2. We conjecture (Conjecture 7.2) that the category O+
of A(Γ). We prove the conjecture for g =bsl2 (Theorem 7.9).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give some background on quantum
aﬃne (or loop) algebras and their Borel subalgebras.
In Section 3 we review the main
properties of the category O introduced in [HJ] and we introduce the subcategories O+ and
O− of interest for this paper (Deﬁnition 3.9). In Section 4 we state the main result on the
isomorphism between the cluster algebra A(Γ) and a Grothendieck ring of representations
in O+ (Theorem 4.2).
In section 5 we establish relevant properties of O+, in particular
a duality with the category O− (Theorem 5.17). The proof of Theorem 4.2 is given in
Section 6. In the concluding Section 7 we present a conjecture on monoidal categoriﬁcations
(Conjecture 7.2) and we give various evidences, in particular the existence of asymptotic
representations (Section 7.2) and the factorization of simple modules into prime modules

when g = bsl2 (Theorem 7.7). To conclude we present additional conjectural relations in

K0(O+) extending the generalized Baxter relations of [FH] (Conjecture 7.12).

The main results of this paper were presented in several conferences (Oberwolfach Work-
shop ”Enveloping algebras and geometric representation theory” in May 2015, Conference
”Categorical Representation Theory and Combinatorics” in Seoul in December 2015, Con-
ference ”A bridge between representation theory and Physics” in Canterbury in January
2016). An announcement was also published in the Oberwolfach Report [H4].

of non-twisted aﬃne type. We denote by g the Kac-Moody Lie algebra associated with C.
Set I = {1, . . . , n}, and denote by ˙g the ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie algebra associated with

the simple coroots, the fundamental weights, the fundamental coweights and the Cartan
subalgebra of ˙g, respectively. We set Q = ⊕i∈IZαi, Q+ = ⊕i∈I Z≥0αi, P = ⊕i∈I Zωi. We will
also use PQ = P ⊗ Q with its partial ordering deﬁned by ω ≤ ω′ if and only if ω′ − ω ∈ Q+.
Let D = diag(d0, . . . , dn) be the unique diagonal matrix such that B = DC is symmetric
and the di’s are relatively prime positive integers. We denote by ( , ) : Q × Q → Z the
invariant symmetric bilinear form such that (αi, αi) = 2di. We use the numbering of the
Dynkin diagram as in [Ka]. Let a0, . . . , an be the Kac labels ([Ka], pp.55-56). We have
a0 = 1 and we set α0 = −(a1α1 + a2α2 + · · · + anαn).

Throughout this paper, we ﬁx a non-zero complex number q which is not a root of unity.
We set qi = qdi. We ﬁx once and for all h ∈ C such that q = eh, and we deﬁne qr = erh for
any r ∈ Q. Since q is not a root of unity, for r, s ∈ Q we have that qr = qs if and only if
r = s.

We will use the standard symbols for q-integers

The algebra Uq(g) has a Z-grading deﬁned by deg(ei) = deg(fi) = deg(k±1

and deg(e0) = −deg(f0) = 1. It satisﬁes deg(x±
i,m) = m for i ∈ I, m ∈ Z. For
a ∈ C∗, there is a corresponding automorphism τa : Uq(g) → Uq(g) such that τa(x) = amx

(2.3)

Uq(g) ≃ Uq(g)− ⊗ Uq(g)0 ⊗ Uq(g)+.

2.2. Borel algebra.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The Borel algebra Uq(b) is the subalgebra of Uq(g) generated by ei and k±1
with 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

This is a Hopf subalgebra of Uq(g). The algebra Uq(b) contains the Drinfeld generators

Let Uq(b)± = Uq(g)± ∩ Uq(b) and Uq(b)0 = Uq(g)0 ∩ Uq(b). Then we have

3. Representations of Borel algebras

In this section we review results on representations of the Borel algebra Uq(b), in partic-
ular on the category O deﬁned in [HJ] and on ﬁnite-dimensional representations of Uq(g).
We also introduce the subcategories O+ and O− of particular interest for this paper.

3.1. Highest ℓ-weight modules. For a Uq(b)-module V and ω ∈ PQ, we have the weight

We denote by Pℓ the set of ℓ-weights. Identifying (Ψi,m)m≥0 with its generating series we

shall write

Ψ = (Ψi(z))i∈I , Ψi(z) = Xm≥0

Ψi,mzm.

The ℓ-weight Ψ is obtained from Ψ by replacing every pole and zero of Ψ by its inverse.

Since each Ψi(z) is an invertible formal power series, Pℓ has a natural group structure
by component-wise multiplication. We have a surjective morphism of groups ̟ : Pℓ → PQ

given by Ψi(0) = q

̟(Ψ)(α∨
i )
i

. For a Uq(b)-module V and Ψ ∈ Pℓ, the linear subspace

(3.6)

VΨ = {v ∈ V | ∃p ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ I, ∀m ≥ 0, (φ+

i,m − Ψi,m)pv = 0}

is called the ℓ-weight space of V of ℓ-weight Ψ. Note that since φ+
where ω = ̟(Ψ).

i,0 = ki, we have VΨ ⊂ Vω,

Deﬁnition 3.2. A Uq(b)-module V is said to be of highest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ Pℓ if there is v ∈ V
such that V = Uq(b)v and the following hold:

ei v = 0

(i ∈ I) ,

φ+
i,mv = Ψi,mv

(i ∈ I, m ≥ 0) .

The ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ Pℓ is uniquely determined by V . It is called the highest ℓ-weight of V .
The vector v is said to be a highest ℓ-weight vector of V . For any Ψ ∈ Pℓ, there exists a
simple highest ℓ-weight module L(Ψ) of highest ℓ-weight Ψ. This module is unique up to
isomorphism.

For Ψ an ℓ-weight, we set eΨ = (̟(Ψ))−1Ψ and we introduce the simple Uq(b)-module

eL(Ψ) := L(cid:16)eΨ(cid:17) .

This is the simple Uq(b)-module obtained from L(Ψ) by shifting all ℓ-weights by ̟(Ψ)−1
(see [HJ, Remark 2.5]).

The submodule of L(Ψ) ⊗ L(Ψ′) generated by the tensor product of the highest ℓ-weight
vectors is of highest ℓ-weight ΨΨ′. In particular, L(ΨΨ′) is a subquotient of L(Ψ)⊗ L(Ψ′).

Deﬁnition 3.3. [HJ] For i ∈ I and a ∈ C×, let

i,a = L(Ψ±1

We call L+

i,a (resp. L−

i,a) a positive (resp. negative) prefundamental representation.

Note that the representation [ω] is 1-dimensional with a trivial action of e0, · · · , en.
For a ∈ C×, the subalgebra Uq(b) is stable by τa. Denote its restriction to Uq(b) by the

same letter. Then the pullbacks of the Uq(b)-modules L±

i,b by τa is L±

i,ab.

3.2. Category O. For λ ∈ PQ, we set D(λ) = {ω ∈ PQ | ω ≤ λ}.

Deﬁnition 3.5. [HJ] A Uq(b)-module V is said to be in category O if:

i) V is Cartan-diagonalizable;
ii) for all ω ∈ PQ we have dim(Vω) < ∞;
iii) there exist a ﬁnite number of elements λ1, . . . , λs ∈ PQ such that the weights of V are

in Sj=1,...,s

D(λj).

The category O is a monoidal category.

Remark 3.6. The deﬁnition of O is slightly diﬀerent from that in [HJ] as we allow only
rational powers of q for the eigenvalues of ki.

Let P r

ℓ be the subgroup of Pℓ consisting of Ψ such that Ψi(z) is a rational function of z

for any i ∈ I.

Theorem 3.7. [HJ] Let Ψ ∈ Pℓ. A simple object in the category O is of highest ℓ-weight
and the simple module L(Ψ) is in category O if and only if Ψ ∈ P r
ℓ . Moreover, for V in
category O, VΨ 6= 0 implies Ψ ∈ P r
ℓ .

Given a map c : P r

ℓ → Z, consider its support
supp(c) = {Ψ ∈ P r

ℓ | c(Ψ) 6= 0}.

Let Eℓ be the additive group of maps c : P r
ℓ → Z such that ̟(supp(c)) is contained in a ﬁnite
union of sets of the form D(µ), and such that for every ω ∈ PQ, the set supp(c) ∩ ̟−1({ω})
is ﬁnite. Similarly, let E be the additive group of maps c : PQ → Z whose support is
contained in a ﬁnite union of sets of the form D(µ). The map ̟ is naturally extended to a
surjective homomorphism ̟ : Eℓ → E.

As for the category O of a classical Kac-Moody Lie algebra, the multiplicity of a simple
module in a module of our category O is well-deﬁned (see [Ka, Section 9.6]) and we have
its Grothendieck ring K0(O). Its elements are the formal sums

χ = XΨ∈P r

ℓ

λΨ[L(Ψ)]

|λΨ|dim((L(Ψ))ω)[ω] is in E.

where the λΨ∈Z are set so thatPΨ∈P r

ℓ ,ω∈PQ

We naturally identify E with the Grothendieck ring of the category of representations of
O with constant ℓ-weights, the simple objects of which are the [ω], ω ∈ PQ. Thus as in [Ka,
Section 9.7] we will regard elements of E as formal sums

c = Xω∈supp(c)

c(ω)[ω].

The multiplication is given by [ω][ω′] = [ω + ω′] and E is regarded as a subring of K0(O). If
(ci)i∈N is a countable family of elements of E such that for any ω ∈ PQ, ci(ω) 6= 0 for ﬁnitely

many i ∈ N, then the sumPi∈N ci is well deﬁned as a map PQ → Z. When this map is in
E we say thatPi∈N ci is a countable sum of elements in E. Note that we have the analog

notion of a countable sum in K0(O), compatible with countable sums of characters in E.

3.3. Finite-dimensional representations. Let C be the category of (type 1) ﬁnite-dimen-
sional representations of Uq(g).

For i ∈ I, let Pi(z) ∈ C[z] be a polynomial with constant term 1. Set

Ψ = (Ψi(z))i∈I , Ψi(z) = qdeg(Pi)

i

Pi(zq−1
)
Pi(zqi)

i

.

Then L(Ψ) is ﬁnite-dimensional. Moreover the action of Uq(b) can be uniquely extended
to an action of Uq(g), and any simple object in the category C is of this form. Hence C is a
subcategory of O and the inclusion functor preserves simple objects.

For i ∈ I and a ∈ C∗, we denote by Vi,a the simple ﬁnite-dimensional representation

associated with the polynomials

The modules Vi,a are called the fundamental representations.

Pi(z) = 1 − za,

Pj(z) = 1 (j 6= i).

3.4. The categories O+ and O−. We introduce two new subcategories O+ and O− of the
category O.

Deﬁnition 3.8. An ℓ-weight is said to be positive (resp. negative) if it is a monomial in
the following ℓ-weights :
• the Yi,a = qiΨ−1
i,aqi
• the Ψi,a (resp. Ψ−1
• the [ω], where ω ∈ PQ.

Deﬁnition 3.9. O+ (resp. O−) is the category of representations in O whose simple con-
stituents have a positive (resp. negative) highest ℓ-weight.

Remark 3.10. (i) By construction, O+, O− are stable by extensions. We will prove they
are also stable by tensor products (Theorem 5.17).

(ii) There are other remarkable subcategories of O, for example the category bO of rep-
resentations of Uq(g) which belong to O as representations of Uq(b). This category bO was

(v) The factorization of real simple modules in O into prime representations is not unique,
so the full category O is not a good candidate for the notion of monoidal categoriﬁcation

discussed in the introduction. For example for g = bsl2, it follows from [MY, Remark 4.3,
L(cid:18)q−5 1 − q4z
1 − q−10z(cid:19) ⊗ L(cid:18)q−7 1 − q8z
1 − q−6z(cid:19) .

1 − q−10z(cid:19) ≃ L(cid:18)q−7 1 − q4z

1 − q−6z(cid:19) ⊗ L(cid:18)q−9 1 − q8z

Moreover the tensor product is simple real and each simple factor has the character of a
Verma module. Consequently each factor is not isomorphic to a tensor product of prefun-
damental representations and so is prime.

By [HL3], the quivereΓ has two isomorphic connected components. We pick one of the two
isomorphic connected components of eΓ and call it Γ. The vertex set of Γ is denoted by V .

A second labeling of the vertices of Γ is deduced from the ﬁrst one by means of the function
ψ deﬁned by

and s = r + diCi,j).

(4.8)

ψ(i, r) = (i, r + di),

((i, r) ∈ V ).

Let W ⊂ I × Z be the image of V under ψ. We shall denote by G the same quiver as Γ but
with vertices labeled by W .

By analogy with [HL3, Section 2.2.1], consider an inﬁnite set of indeterminates

z = {zi,r | (i, r) ∈ V }

over Q. Let A(Γ) be the cluster algebra deﬁned by the initial seed (z, Γ). Thus, A(Γ) is the
subring of the ﬁeld of rational functions Q(z) generated by all the cluster variables, that is
the elements obtained from some element of z via a ﬁnite sequence of seed mutations. Each
element of A(Γ) is a linear combination of ﬁnite monomials in some cluster variables. By
the Laurent phenomenon [FZ1], A(Γ) is contained in Z[z±1

i,r ](i,r)∈V .

For our purposes in this paper, it is always possible to work with suﬃciently large ﬁnite
subseeds of the seed (z, Γ), and replace A(Γ) by the genuine cluster subalgebras attached
to them. On the other hand, statements become nicer if we allow ourselves to formulate
them in terms of the inﬁnite rank cluster algebra A(Γ).

Deﬁnition 4.1. Deﬁne the category O+
2Z as the subcategory of representations in O+ whose
simple constituents have a highest ℓ-weight Ψ such that the roots and the poles of Ψi(z) are
of the form qr with (i, r) ∈ V .

We will write for short ℓi,a = [L+

i,a].

which can be extended to countable sums as above. So the main point of the proof of
Theorem 4.2 will be to show that the subalgebra A(G) ˆ⊗ZE is mapped to K0(O+
2Z) by this
isomorphism.

(ii) As in the case of ﬁnite-dimensional representations, the description of the simple
objects of O+ essentially reduces to the description of the simple objects of O+
2Z (the decom-
position explained in [HL1, §3.7] can be extended to our more general situation by using
the asymptotic approach of §7.2 below). Hence the Grothendieck ring K0(O+
2Z) contains all
the interesting information on K0(O+).

The proof of Theorem 4.2 will be given in §6, using material presented in §5.

5. Properties of the category O+

5.1. q-characters. The q-character morphism was ﬁrst considered in [FR] and is a very
useful tool for our proofs.

Recall from §3.2 the notations E and Eℓ. Because of the support condition, we can endow

E with a ring structure deﬁned by

(c · d)(ω) = Xω′+ω′′=ω

c(ω′)d(ω′′),

(c, d ∈ E, ω ∈ PQ).

CLUSTER ALGEBRAS AND BOREL SUBALGEBRAS OF QUANTUM AFFINE ALGEBRAS

11

Similarly, Eℓ also has a ring structure given by

(c · d)(Ψ) = XΨ′Ψ′′

=Ψ

c(Ψ′)d(Ψ′′),

(c, d ∈ Eℓ, Ψ ∈ P r

ℓ ),

and such that ̟ becomes a ring homomorphism.

For Ψ ∈ P r

ℓ and ω ∈ PQ, we deﬁne the delta functions [Ψ] = δΨ,. ∈ Eℓ and [ω] = δω,. ∈ E,
where as usual δ denotes the Kr¨onecker symbol. Note that the above multiplications give

[Ψ′] · [Ψ′′] = [Ψ′Ψ′′],

[ω′] · [ω′′] = [ω′ + ω′′].

Let V be a Uq(b)-module in category O. We deﬁne [FR, HJ] the q-character and the

eχ(V ) := ̟(eχq(V )).

Following [FR], consider the ring of Laurent polynomials Y = Z[Y ±1

indeterminates {Yi,a}i∈I,a∈C∗ . Let M be the group of monomials of Y. For example, for

In particular, χq(V ) can be viewed as an element of Y.

It is proved in [FR] that a ﬁnite-dimensional Uq(g)-module V satisﬁes V =Lm∈M Vm(φ(z)).
that Ψ = M(cid:0)φ(z)(cid:1). We will also denote L(Ψ) = L(M ).

A monomial M ∈ M is said to be dominant if M ∈ Z[Yi,a]i∈I,a∈C∗. Given a ﬁnite-
dimensional simple Uq(g)-module L(Ψ), there exists a dominant monomial M ∈ M such

Remark 5.7. By our main Theorem 4.2 (and its dual version, see Remark 5.18), these
generalized Baxter relations are interpreted as relations in the cluster algebra A(G). More-

mutation relations.

over when g = bsl2 the original Baxter relation (1.2) get interpreted as Fomin-Zelevinsky

The right-hand side of a generalized Baxter relation is a E-linear combination of classes
of tensor products of prefundamental representations. As shown in [FH], this can be seen
as a tensor product decomposition in K(O). Indeed we have:

Proposition 5.11. A representation V in O± satisfying [V ] ∈ K ±

0 has ﬁnite length.

Remark 5.12. An object in the category O has not necessarily ﬁnite length. The subcat-
egory of objects of ﬁnite length is not stable by tensor product [BJMST, Lemma C.1].
Proof. Suppose [V ] ∈ K +
0 . Then there is a monomial M in the ℓi,a such that M χℓ(V ) is a
polynomial in the ℓi,a. There is a tensor product L of positive prefundamental representa-
tions such that χℓ(L) = M . Then L ⊗ V has ﬁnite length, hence the result.

(ii) For any dominant monomial m, we have

D([L(m)]) = [L(m1)]

where m1 is obtained from m by replacing each Yi,a by Yi,a−1. Indeed L(m1) is isomorphic
to ((L(m))′)∗ whose highest weight monomial is the inverse of the lowest weight monomial

(m1)−1 of L(m)′. For example for g =bsl2, we have D([L(Y1,a)] = [L(Y1,a−1)] as this can be

observed by comparing the two formulas in (5.11).

Remark 5.15. The duality D is compatible with characters by (i) in Theorem 5.3. However
it is not compatible with q-characters (for example negative and positive prefundamental
representations have very diﬀerent q-characters as explained above).
Proposition 5.16. An element in the Grothendieck group K0(O±) is a (possibly countable)
sum of elements in K ±

Proof. Let us prove it for K0(O+) (the proof is analog for K0(O−)). By deﬁnition, the
positive ℓ-weights label the simple modules in O+. Moreover, an ℓ-weight is positive if and
only if it is a product of highest ℓ-weights of representations L+
i,a, Vi(a) and [ω]. This implies
that for each positive ℓ-weight Ψ, we can choose (and ﬁx) a monomial in the [L+
i,a], [Vi(a)],
[ω] such that the corresponding representation has highest ℓ-weight equal to Ψ. Hence the
positive ℓ-weights also label the linearly independent family of these monomials in K +
0 .
Expanding these monomials we get ﬁnite sums of classes of simple modules by Proposition
5.11. We get an (inﬁnite) transition matrix from the classes of simple objects in O+ to such
products in K +
0 , and this matrix is unitriangular (for the standard partial ordering with
respect to weight). Hence the result.
(cid:3)

This implies immediately the following.

Theorem 5.17. O+ and O− are monoidal and the morphism D extends uniquely to an
isomorphism of E-algebras

D : K0(O+) → K0(O−).

Remark 5.18. Consequently, our main result in Theorem 4.2 may also be written in terms
of the subcategory O−

Z whose Grothendieck ring is D(K0(O+

2Z of O−

2Z)).

Proof. For L, L′ simple in O+, we may consider a decomposition of [L], [L′] as a countable
sum of elements in K +
0 as in Proposition 5.16. Then [L][L′] is also such a countable sum
and is in K0(O+). Hence O+ is monoidal. This is analog for O−.

The isomorphism of Proposition 5.13 is extended by linearity to K0(O+) by using Propo-
sition 5.16. This map D : K0(O+) → K0(O−) is an injective ring morphism. The ring
morphism D−1 : K0(O−) → K0(O+) is constructed in the same way and so D is a ring
isomorphism.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.19. A simple object in O± is a subquotient of a tensor product of two simple
representations V ⊗ L where V is ﬁnite-dimensional and L is a tensor product of positive
(resp. negative) prefundamental representations.

Proof. Let L(Ψ) be simple in O±. By deﬁnition, its highest ℓ-weight is a product of highest
ℓ-weights of representations [ω], L±
i,a, Vi(a) where ω ∈ PQ, i ∈ I, a ∈ C∗. So Ψ can be
factorized in

where ω ∈ PQ, ±ui,a ≥ 0 and m ∈ M is a dominant monomial. The result follows by taking

Proposition 5.20. The normalized q-character of a simple object in O− belongs to the ring
Z[[A−1

i,a ]]i∈I,a∈C∗.

Proof. The result is known for the category C by [FM]. For negative prefundamental repre-
sentations, the result is known by [HJ, Theorem 6.1]. Then the general result follows from
Proposition 5.19.

Note that this property is not satisﬁed in O+, see Example 5.4.

(6.14)

By Theorem 5.8, the two terms on the right-hand side are simple. Hence this is the decom-
position of the class of the tensor product into simple modules.
6.2. Proof of Theorem 4.2. We identify the E-algebras E[z±1
in Remark 4.3.

i,qr ](i,r)∈V as

Proposition 6.1. We have: K +

0 ∩ K0(O+

2Z) ⊆ A(G) ⊗Z E.

Note that by Proposition 5.16, this implies K0(O+

2Z) ⊆ A(G) ˆ⊗ZE

Proof. Clearly, ℓi,qs = zi,s[(s/2di)ωi] belongs to A(G)Z ⊗Z E for any (i, s) ∈ V . By Propo-
sition 5.16, it remains to show that [Vi,qr ] belongs to A(G)Z ⊗Z E for any (i, r) ∈ W .

Remember from §4.1 that we denote by G the same quiver as Γ with vertices labeled by
W instead of V . In the next discussion, we divide the vertices of G and Γ into columns,
as in [HL3, Example 2.3], and we denote by k the number of columns. As in [HL3, §2.1.3],
consider the full subquiver G− of G whose vertex set is W − = {(i, r) ∈ W | r ≤ 0}.
The deﬁnition of G shows that there is only one vertex of G \ G− in each column which is
connected to G− by some arrow. Let H − denote the ice quiver obtained from G− by adding
these k vertices together with their connecting arrows, and by declaring the new vertices
frozen.

Consider the cluster algebras A(H −) (with k frozen variables) and A(G−) (with no frozen
It follows from the deﬁnitions that A(H −) can be regarded as a subalgebra

of A(G), and A(G−) is the coeﬃcient-free counterpart of A(H −), studied in [HL3]. Let
fj (1 ≤ j ≤ k) be the frozen variable of A(H −) sitting in column j. The cluster of the
initial seed of A(H −) thus consists of the frozen variables fj (1 ≤ j ≤ k) and the ordinary
cluster variables zi,s ((i, s) ∈ V −), where V − = {(i, s) ∈ V | s + di ≤ 0}. Let us denote by
ui,s ((i, s) ∈ V −) the cluster variables of the initial seed of A(G−). We can use a similar
change of variables as in [HL3, §2.2.2]:

yi,r = ui,r−di

if r + 2di > 0,

yi,r =

ui,r−di
ui,r+di

otherwise.

Let

F : Z[u±1

i,s | 1 ≤ j ≤ k, (i, s) ∈ V −]

be the ring homomorphism deﬁned by

F (ui,s) =

Thus

F (yi,r) =

zi,r−di

fj

if r + 2di > 0 and (i, r) sits in column j, F (yi,r) =

zi,r−di
zi,r+di

otherwise.

We introduce a Zk-grading on Z[f ±1

deg(fj) = ej,

i,s | 1 ≤ j ≤ k, (i, s) ∈ V −] by declaring that

where (ej, 1 ≤ j ≤ k) denotes the canonical basis of Zk.

Let x be the cluster variable of A(G−) obtained from the initial seed ({ui,s}, G−) via
a sequence of mutations σ, and let y be the cluster variable of A(H −) obtained from the
initial seed ({zi,s, fj}, H −) via the same sequence of mutations σ. We want to compare the
Laurent polynomials y and F (x). Since deg(F (ui,s)) = (0, . . . , 0) for every (i, s), we see
that F (x) is multi-homogeneous of degree (0, . . . , 0) for the above grading. On the other
hand, it is easy to check that for every non-frozen vertex (i, s) of the ice quiver H − the
sum of the multi-degrees of the initial cluster variables and frozen variables sitting at the
targets of the arrows going out of (i, s) is equal to the sum of the multi-degrees of the initial
cluster variables and frozen variables sitting at the sources of the arrows going into (i, s).
Therefore, A(H −) is a multi-graded cluster algebra, in the sense of [GL]. It follows that y
is also multi-homogeneous, of degree (a1, . . . , ak). Now, by construction, we have

Taking a cluster expansion with respect to the initial cluster of A(H −), we write y = N/D

Now we can conclude using [HL3, Theorem 3.1], which implies that for all (i, r) ∈ W −
with r ≪ 0, the q-character of Vi,qr (expressed in terms of the variables yi,s ≡ Yi,qs) is a
cluster variable x of A(G−). By [FM, Corollary 6.14], for r ≪ 0 this cluster variable does not
contain any variable yi,s with s + 2di > 0, hence F (x) does not contain any frozen variable
fj. Therefore y = F (x), and the q-character of Vi,qr (expressed in terms of the variables
zi,s) is a cluster variable of A(H −), that is, a cluster variable of A(Γ). This proves the claim
for every fundamental module Vi,qr with r ≪ 0. But by deﬁnition of the cluster algebra
A(Γ), the set of cluster variables is invariant under the change of variables zi,s 7→ zi,s+2di.
Thus we are done.

Proposition 6.2. We have: A(G) ˆ⊗ZE ⊆ K0(O+

2Z).

Consider an element χ in A(G). By the Laurent phenomenon [FZ1], χ is a Laurent

polynomial in the initial cluster variables :

χ = P ({zi,r}(i,r)∈V ).

Hence A(G) is a subalgebra of the fraction ﬁeld of K0(O+

We recall the notion of negative ℓ-weight is introduced in Deﬁnition 3.8.

Lemma 6.3. Let χ ∈ A(G) non zero. Then at least one negative ℓ-weight occurs in
χq(D(χ)).

Proof. We will use the following partial ordering (cid:22) on the set of ℓ-weights Ψ satisfying
̟(Ψ) = 1 : for such ℓ-weights Ψ, Ψ′, we set Ψ (cid:23) Ψ′ if

As the sum (6.16) is ﬁnite, there is α0 such that mα0 is maximal for (cid:22). We prove that

mα0 is a negative ℓ-weight.

Let N such that all the cluster variables zi,r of the initial seed occurring in the Laurent
monomials of the Equation (6.16) satisfy r > −2d(N +2) where d = Maxi∈I (di) is the lacing
number of ˙g. We consider as above the semi-inﬁnite cluster algebra A(H +
N ) obtained from
A(G) where the cluster variables sitting at (i, r) ∈ V , r ≤ −d(N + 2) have been removed.
As explained in the proof of Proposition 6.1, A(H +
N ) can be regarded as a subalgebra of
A(G). We replace every cluster variable zi,r of the initial seed by the class of the Kirillov-
Reshetikhin module Wi,r associated to the monomial

(Here the monomial is set to be 1 if r > 2dN ). We obtain

φN (χ) ∈ Frac(K0(C))

the image of χ in the fraction ﬁeld of K0(C). By using the duality D, we reverse all spectral
parameters (by (ii) in Example 5.14 illustrating Proposition 5.13, or by [HL1, Section 3.4]).
We obtain the same3 as in [HL3, Section 2.2.2]. Then by [HL3, Theorem 5.1], D(φN (χ))
belongs to the Grothendieck ring of C. So by applying D again, φN (χ) is in K0(C).

Lemma 6.4. Let Ψ be a negative ℓ-weight such that the roots and the poles of Ψi(z) are
of the form qr with (i, r) ∈ V . Then there is a unique F (Ψ) ∈ χq(D(K0(O+
2Z))) such that
Ψ is the unique negative ℓ-weight occurring in F (Ψ) and its coeﬃcient is 1.

Moreover F (Ψ) is of the form

(6.18)

F (Ψ) = [Ψ] + XΨ′

,̟(Ψ′

)≺̟(Ψ)

λΨ′[Ψ′],

for the usual partial ordering on weights and with the λΨ′ ∈ Z.
Proof. The uniqueness follows from Proposition 6.1 and Lemma 6.3. For each negative ℓ-
weight Ψ as in the Lemma, there is a representation M (Ψ) in O+
2Z such that χq(D([M (Ψ)]))
is of the form

χq(D([M (Ψ)])) = [Ψ] + XΨ′

,̟(Ψ′

Indeed it suﬃces to consider a tensor product of fundamental and positive prefundamental
representations. Now if the F (Ψ) do exist, we have an inﬁnite triangular transition matrix

We can now ﬁnish the proof of Proposition 6.2 :

Proof. Let χ be in A(G). For Ψ a negative ℓ-weight, we denote by λΨ the coeﬃcient of Ψ
in χq(D(χ)). Then by lemma 6.3 we have

χq(D(χ)) = XΨ negative

As the F (Ψ) are of the form (6.18), this sum is well-deﬁned in χq(D(K0(O+

Example 6.5. Let us illustrate the proof of Lemma 6.3 which is the crucial technical point
for the proof of Proposition 6.2. Consider the sequence of mutations of 6.1.1. Let us write
the cluster variables φN (χ) :

7. Conjectures and evidences

7.1. A conjecture. The concept of a monoidal categoriﬁcation of a cluster algebra was
introduced in [HL3, Deﬁnition 2.1]. We say that a simple object S of a monoidal category

is real if S ⊗ S is simple. Let us recall that a cluster monomial is a monomial in the cluster
variables of a single cluster.

Deﬁnition 7.1. Let A be a cluster algebra and let M be an abelian monoidal category. We
say that A is a monoidal categoriﬁcation of A if there is an isomorphism between A and
the Grothendieck ring of M such that the cluster monomials of A are the classes of all the
real simple objects of M (up to invertibles).

See [HL2, Section 2] for a discussion on applications of monoidal categoriﬁcations.

In

view of Theorem 4.2, it is natural to formulate the following conjecture.

Conjecture 7.2. The isomorphism of Theorem 4.2 deﬁnes a monoidal categoriﬁcation,
that is, the cluster monomials in A(Γ) get identiﬁed with real simple objects in O+
2Z up to
invertible representations.

Remark 7.3. By using the duality in Proposition 5.13, the statement of Theorem 4.2 and
of Conjecture 7.2 can also be formulated in terms of the category O−
2Z.

Note that Theorem 5.8 implies that all cluster monomials of the initial seed are identi-
ﬁed with real simple objects, more precisely with simple tensor products of positive pre-
fundamental representations, in agreement with Conjecture 7.2. To give other evidences
supporting Conjecture 7.2, we will use the results in the next subsection.

7.2. Limiting characters. We will be using the dual category O∗ considered in [HJ] whose
deﬁnition we now recall.
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let O∗ be the category of Cartan-diagonalizable Uq(b)-modules V such that
V ∗ is in category O.

A Uq(b)-module V is said to be of lowest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ Pℓ if there is v ∈ V such that

V = Uq(b)v and the following hold:
Uq(b)−v = Cv ,

φ+
i,mv = Ψi,mv

(i ∈ I, m ≥ 0) .

For Ψ ∈ Pℓ, there exists up to isomorphism a unique simple Uq(b)-module L′(Ψ) of lowest
ℓ-weight Ψ. This module belongs to O∗. More precisely, we have:
Proposition 7.5. [HJ] For Ψ ∈ Pℓ we have (L′(Ψ))∗ ≃ L(Ψ−1).

We can also deﬁne as in §5.1 notions of characters and q-characters for O∗.
We now explain that characters (resp. q-characters) of certain simple objects in the
category O− can be obtained as limits of characters (resp. q-characters) of ﬁnite-dimensional
representations. This is known for negative prefundamental representations [HJ].

Let L(Ψ) be a simple module whose highest ℓ-weight can be written as a ﬁnite product

where ω ∈ PQ, R0 ≥ 0, ui,qr ≤ 0 and m ∈ M is a dominant monomial. For R ≥ R0, set

Proof. First let us prove that the dimensions of weight spaces of eL(Ψ) are larger than those
of eL(MR). Consider the tensor product

T = eL(Ψ) ⊗eL(MRΨ−1).

By deﬁnition of MR, the ℓ-weight MRΨ−1 is a product of Ψ+

highest ℓ-weight MR(̟(MR))−1 by a product of A−1

so by Theorem 5.8, the module eL(MRΨ−1) is a tensor product of positive fundamental
representations. Moreover T and eL(MR) have the same highest ℓ-weight, so eL(MR) is a
subquotient of T . By [FM, Theorem 4.1], each ℓ-weight of eL(MR) is the product of the
5.3, an ℓ-weight of T is an ℓ-weight of eL(MR) only if it is of the form

7.3. Proof of Conjecture 7.2 for g =bsl2. In this section we give an explicit description
of all simple modules in O+ and in O− for g =bsl2.

A q-set is a subset of C∗ of the form {aq2r|R1 ≤ r ≤ R2} where a ∈ C∗ and R1 ≤ R2 ∈
Z ∪ {−∞, +∞}. The KR-modules Wk,a, Wk′,b are said to be in special position if the union
of {a, aq2, · · · , aq2(k−1)} and {b, bq2, · · · , bq2(k′−1)} is a q-set which contains both properly.
The KR-module Wk,a and the prefundamental representation L+
b are said to be in special
position if the union of {a, aq2, aq4, · · · , aq2(k−1)} and {bq, bq3, bq5, · · · } is a q-set which
contains both properly. Two positive prefundamental representations are never in special
position. Two representations are in general position if they are not in special position.
The invertible elements in the category O+ are the 1-dimensional representations [ω].

Theorem 7.7. Suppose that g = bsl2. The prime simple objects in the category O+ are

the positive prefundamental representations and the KR-modules (up to invertibles). Any
simple object in O+ can be factorized in a unique way as a tensor product of prefundamen-
tal representations and KR-modules (up to permutation of the factors and to invertibles).
Moreover, such a tensor product is simple if and only all its factors are pairwise in general
position.

Proof. As in the classical case of ﬁnite-dimensional representations, it is easy to check that
every positive ℓ-weight has a unique factorization as a product of highest ℓ-weights of KR-
modules and positive prefundamental representations in pairwise general position. Hence it
suﬃces to prove the equivalence in the last sentence. By [CP], the result is known for ﬁnite-
dimensional representations. Now, by using Section 7.2, this result implies that a tensor
product with factors which are in general position is simple. Conversely, it is known that a
tensor product of KR-modules which are in special position is not simple. Also, it is easy
to see that the tensor product of a KR-module by a positive prefundamental representation
which are in special position is not simple.
(cid:3)

Remark 7.8. (i) This is a generalization of the factorization of simple representations in

factorization into prime representations is unique.

factorization is not unique in the category ˆO, see Remark 3.10.

C when g =bsl2 [CP].
(ii) This result for g = bsl2 implies that all simple objects in O+ are real and that their
(iii) In [MY], a factorization is proved for simple modules in ˆO when g = bsl2. But the

(iv) By Proposition 5.13, our result implies a similar factorization in the category O−.
(v) The combinatorics of q-sets in pairwise general position is very similar to the com-
binatorics of triangulations of the ∞-gone studied in [GG], in relation with certain cluster
structures of inﬁnite rank. However, in [GG] only arcs (m, n) joining two integers m and n
are considered, whereas we also allow arcs of the form (m, +∞) corresponding to positive
prefundamental representations. Also, we are only interested in one mutation class, namely
the mutation class of the initial triangulation {(m, +∞) | m ∈ Z}.

Theorem 7.9. Conjecture 7.2 is true in the sl2-case.
Proof. Theorem 7.7 provides an explicit factorization of simple objects in O+
2Z into positive
prefundamental representations and ﬁnite-dimensional KR-modules. In particular, we get

CLUSTER ALGEBRAS AND BOREL SUBALGEBRAS OF QUANTUM AFFINE ALGEBRAS

29

an explicit q-character formula for such a simple object and so a complete explicit description
of the Grothendieck ring K0(O+
2Z). Besides the cluster algebra A(Γ) can be also explicitly
described by using triangulations of the ∞-gone (see Remark 7.8). Hence we can argue as
in [HL1, §13.4].
(cid:3)

7.4. Web property theorem. Let us prove the following generalization of the main result
of [H3]. If the monoidal categoriﬁcation conjecture 7.2 holds, then the statement of this
Theorem is a necessary condition for simple modules in the same seed.
Theorem 7.10. Let S1, . . . , SN be simple objects in O+ (resp. in O−). Then S1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ SN
is simple if and only if the tensor products Si ⊗ Sj are simple for i ≤ j.
Proof. By Proposition 5.13, it is equivalent to prove the statement in the category O−.

The ”only if” part is clear.
For the ”if” part of the statement, we may assume without loss of generality that the
zeros and poles of the highest ℓ-weights of the Si are in qZ (see (ii) in Remark 4.3). For each
simple module Si, consider L(MR,i) simple ﬁnite-dimensional module as in Section 7.2. As
Si ⊗ Sj is simple, there is R1 such that for R ≥ R1 the tensor product L(MR,i) ⊗ L(MR,j)

is simple. Indeed, by Theorem 7.6 eχq(Si ⊗ Sj) is the limit of the eχq(L(MR,iMR,j)). More
precisely, there is R1 such that for R ≥ R1, the image of eχq(Si ⊗ Sj) in Z[A−1
is equal to eχq(L(MR,iMR,j)). This implies eχq(L(MR,iMR,j)) =eχq(L(MR,i))eχq(L(MR,j )).

Now, by [H3], L(MR,1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ L(MR,N ) is simple isomorphic to L(MR,1 · · · MR,N ). This
implies that the character of S1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ SN is the same as the character of the simple module
with the same highest ℓ-weight. Hence they are isomorphic.

Remark 7.11. This provides an alternative proof of Theorem 7.7.

7.5. Another conjecture. To conclude, let us state another general conjecture. Although
the cluster algebra structure presented in this paper does not appear in the statement of
this conjecture, it arises naturally if we compare Theorem 4.2 with the results of [HL3].

We consider a simple ﬁnite-dimensional representation L(m) whose dominant monomial
m satisﬁes m ∈ Z[Yi,aqr ](i,r)∈W,r≤R for a given R ∈ Z. We have the corresponding truncated
q-character [HL1]

(L(m)) ∈ mZ[A−1

i,qr ]i∈I,r≤R−di

which is the sum (with multiplicity) of the monomials m′ occurring in χq(L(m)) satisfying
m(m′)−1 ∈ Z[Ai,qr ]i∈I,r≤R−di. As in the statement of Theorem 5.5, we consider

For (i, r) ∈ WR, we set ui,r to be the maximum of 0 and of the powers ui,qr (m′) of Yi,qr in
all monomials m′ occurring in χ≤R

(L(m)). Let

DAVID HERNANDEZ AND BERNARD LECLERC

The representations L(Ψ), L(ΨR) are in the category O+. By Theorem 5.8, the represen-
tation L(ΨR) is a simple tensor product of positive prefundamental representations.
Conjecture 7.12. We have the relation in Frac(K0(O+)) :

In some cases the conjecture is already proved :
