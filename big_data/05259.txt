ABSTRACT

Current models of the spectrum of X-rays reﬂected from accretion disks around
black holes and other compact objects are commonly calculated assuming that the
density of the disk atmosphere is constant within several Thomson depths from the
irradiated surface. An important simplifying assumption of these models is that the
ionization structure of the gas is completely speciﬁed by a single, ﬁxed value of the
ionization parameter ξ, which is the ratio of the incident ﬂux to the gas density. The
density is typically ﬁxed at ne = 1015 cm−3. Motivated by observations, we consider
higher densities in the calculation of the reﬂected spectrum. We show by computing
model spectra for ne (cid:38) 1017 cm−3 that high-density eﬀects signiﬁcantly modify reﬂec-
tion spectra. The main eﬀect is to boost the thermal continuum at energies (cid:46) 2 keV.
We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting observations of both AGN
and black hole binaries. We also discuss the limitations of our models imposed by the
quality of the atomic data currently available.

1 INTRODUCTION

X-ray reﬂection spectroscopy is arguably the most eﬀective
means currently available for probing the eﬀects of strong
gravity near the event horizon of an accreting black hole.
The reﬂection spectrum is produced from the reprocessing of
high-energy coronal photons in an optically-thick accretion
disk. The result is a rich spectrum of radiative recombina-
tion continua, absorption edges and ﬂuorescent lines, most
notably the Fe K complex in the 6–8 keV energy range (Ross
& Fabian 1993; R´o˙za´nska et al. 2002; Ross & Fabian 1993;
Garc´ıa & Kallman 2010). This reﬂected radiation leaves the
disk carrying a wealth of information on the physical com-
position and condition of the matter in the strong ﬁeld near
a black hole. The Fe K emission lines (and other ﬂuores-
cent lines) are broadened and shaped by Doppler eﬀects,
light bending and gravitational redshift (Fabian et al. 2000;
Reynolds & Nowak 2003; Dovˇciak et al. 2004; Dauser et al.
2012).

Reﬂection models are the sine qua non of the Fe-line
method of measuring black hole spin, which is enormously
important because of its dominant role in measuring the
spins of supermassive black holes in active galactic nu-
clei (AGN) (e.g., Patrick et al. 2011; Walton et al. 2013;
Reynolds 2014; Parker et al. 2014). Importantly, this method
is equally applicable to measuring the spins of stellar-mass
black holes (i.e., black hole binaries, BHB; McClintock et al.
2014; Gou et al. 2014; Steiner et al. 2014; Miller & Miller
2015; Chen et al. 2015). X-ray reﬂection is also observed in
other astrophysical sources such as neutron stars (Cackett
et al. 2010), cataclysmic variables (Mukai et al. 2015), and
ultra-compact X-ray binaries (Madej et al. 2014).

For the past three decades, models of X-ray reﬂection,
which are complex, have undergone continual improvement
(see Fabian & Ross 2010, for a review). Currently, the most
advanced model is xillver, which relative to earlier models
incorporates a more complete atomic database and an im-
proved solution to the problem of radiative transfer (Garc´ıa
& Kallman 2010; Garc´ıa et al. 2013). The reﬂection model
xillver has been linked with the relativistic convolution

code relline (Dauser et al. 2010, 2013) to provide the com-
plete relativistic reﬂection package relxill (Garc´ıa et al.
2014), which is presently the state-of-the-art in modeling
ionized reﬂection in strong gravity. As the wealth of obser-
vational data grows in both quantity and quality, so must
the theoretical models.

A common simplifying assumption of reﬂection models
is that the density of the disk atmosphere is constant, al-
though hydrostatic atmosphere models have been explored
(e.g., Nayakshin & Kallman 2001; Ballantyne et al. 2001;
R´o˙za´nska & Madej 2008). The assumption of constant den-
sity signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the problem and so far has proven
to provide a good representation of the data. A second sim-
pliﬁcation for constant density calculations is that a speciﬁc
model can be characterized by a single value of the ioniza-
tion parameter, which is proportional to the ratio of the
illuminating ﬂux to the gas density. In photoionization cal-
culations, it is standard practice to assume that, for all val-
ues of ﬂux and density under consideration, the ionization
structure of the gas is solely determined by this one param-
eter. That is, it is simply the ratio of ﬂux to density that
determines the ionization structure of the atmosphere and
properties of the reﬂection spectrum.

The eﬀects of high density on the reﬂection spectrum
are most important for powerful coronae and for black holes
of low mass. Some high-density models (ne = 1020 cm−3) for
black hole binaries were computed by Ross & Fabian (2007),
and for neutron stars by Ballantyne (2004). An equation re-
lating the density of a standard α-disk at high accretion
rates, for which the inner region is radiation-pressure domi-
nated, is given by Svensson & Zdziarski (1994):

where f is the fraction of the total power released into the

corona; σT = 6.64×10−25 cm2 is the Thomson cross section;
RS = 2GM/c2 is the Schwarzschild radius, r = R/RS; and
m = ˙M c2LEdd is the dimensionless accretion rate expressed
in terms of the Eddington luminosity LEdd ∼ 1038 erg s−1.
Figure 1 shows in the M vs. f plane lines of constant ne ˙m2
for r = 10 and α = 0.1. Note that the pressure-dominated
radius disappears when f approaches unity and when ˙m <
0.1, i.e., below 1% of the Eddington limit (see Fig. 2 of
Svensson & Zdziarski 1994).
Most current reﬂection models adopt a moderate value
of density, typically ne = 1015 cm−3, which is appropriate
for low values of the coronal fraction f , high mass accretion
rates, and black holes with M > 107 M(cid:12). Meanwhile, for
lower accretion rates and low-mass black holes, current mod-
els should be adequate because, as we shall demonstrate, the
major eﬀects of higher densities on the reﬂection spectrum
occur below 3 keV.

In this paper, using the xillver code and the approx-
imation of constant density, we explore the eﬀects on re-
ﬂection spectra of varying the gas density over the range
ne = 1015 − 1019 cm−3. We show that the temperature of
the atmosphere increases markedly at ne (cid:38) 1017 cm−3. The
main eﬀect on the spectrum is a signiﬁcant increase in the
ﬂux at low energies ((cid:46) 2 keV).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we de-
scribe in detail the eﬀects of high density on the thermal
and ionization balance, and hence on models of the reﬂec-
tion spectrum. In Section 3 we discuss the implications of
these eﬀects for modeling AGN and BHB spectral data, as
well as the limitations of the models themselves that are im-
posed by the quality of the atomic data currently available.

2 X-RAY REFLECTION AT HIGH-DENSITY

The calculations of the reprocessing of X-rays in illumi-
nated accretion disks are carried out using our reﬂection
code xillver. This approach has been extensively described
in previous papers (Garc´ıa & Kallman 2010; Garc´ıa et al.
2013, 2014), therefore here we will only provide a short
overview. xillver solves the radiative transfer in a plane-
parallel (slab) geometry, using the Feautrier method as de-
scribed in Mihalas (1978). The boundary condition at the
surface of the disk, which is placed at a Thomson depth
τT = 10−4, speciﬁes the incident radiation ﬁeld. A second in-
ner boundary condition speciﬁes the incident radiation ﬁeld
at the bottom of the slab, which in our calculations is set
at τT = 10. The calculation of the ionization and thermal
balance is done implementing the photoionization routines
from the XSTAR code (Kallman & Bautista 2001), which in-
corporates the most complete atomic database for model-
ing synthetic photoionized X-ray spectra. The microphysics
captured by xillver is much more detailed than for any ear-
lier code, principally because we treat in detail the K-shell
atomic properties of many astrophysically relevant ions (e.g.
Kallman et al. 2004; Garc´ıa et al. 2005, 2009).

An important simpliﬁcation commonly adopted in re-
ﬂection modeling is that the number density ne in the illu-
minated atmosphere (which sits on top of a much more op-
tically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk), is constant.
This simpliﬁcation is motivated by the need for large grid of
models that can be easily applied to real observational data.

scribe the reﬂected spectrum. Similar calculations have been
performed assuming that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic
equilibrium (e.g., Nayakshin & Kallman 2001; Ballantyne
et al. 2001). However, while such calculations are much more
complex than those for constant density, it is still unclear
whether the hydrostatic approximation provides a solution
signiﬁcantly closer to reality than a constant density cal-
culation. In this paper we do not seek to discuss the trade
oﬀ between diﬀerent approximations. For the reminder we
will focus on exploring the eﬀects of high-density in X-ray
illuminated atmospheres with constant density.

A useful quantity to describe constant density models

is the ionization parameter:

ξ =

4πFx

ne

,

(2)

where Fx is the ionizing ﬂux in the 1–1000 Ry band. This
quantity is typically taken as an indicator of the degree of
ionization in the material. This is because it is a measure of
the ratio of the photoionization rate (which is proportional
to Fx × ne) to the recombination rate (which is proportional
to n2
e). Thus, in photoionization modeling of constant den-
sity plasmas it is normally assumed the ξ completely charac-
terizes each model, regardless of the actual values of density
or ﬂux. From this, it is clear that the assumption that both
density and ﬂux can be characterized by a single quantity ξ is
valid as long as photoionization and recombination are the
dominant processes controlling the thermal and ionization
balance of the gas. However, as we show next, this assump-
tion is invalid at suﬃciently high densities, as other physical
processes become important.

2.1 Temperature Solutions

To explore the eﬀects of high-density on the reﬂected spec-
tra, we have carried out calculations with xillver for var-
ious values of the density while keeping the ionization pa-
rameter constant. For all these models the illumination is
described as a power-law spectrum with slope Γ = 2.3, with
a sharp low-energy cutoﬀ at 0.1 keV and a high-energy expo-
nential roll-over at 300 keV. The abundances of all elements
are set to their solar values. These parameters are typical
for AGN or BHB in the soft-state. The density is varied in
the ne = 1015 − 1019 cm−3 range, and the net incident ﬂux
is also varied such that the ionization parameter is always
ξ = 50 erg cm s−1.

Figure 2 shows the temperature proﬁles in the vertical
direction of the illuminated slab resulting from models with
ﬁve diﬀerent densities (as indicated). The overall proﬁles
follow closely the expected behavior in a constant density
photoionized slab: the temperature is higher at the illumi-
nated surface (τT = 10−4) where the gas is more ionized.
At larger depths, as enough photons are removed from the
ionizing continuum, the gas recombines and the temperature
decreases rapidly. This two-zone proﬁle has been reported in
several previous reﬂection calculations (e.g. Ross & Fabian
2005; Garc´ıa & Kallman 2010; Garc´ıa et al. 2013).

The temperature tends to increase with the increase in
density. For densities in the 15 < log(ne) < 17 range, the
hot zone of the slab shows modest variation, while in the
deeper zones the temperature rises with density. For higher

High-Density Eﬀects on X-ray Reﬂection

illuminated atmosphere. Each curve corresponds to a diﬀerent
value of density, as indicated, while the ionization parameter is

densities, the temperature increase can be observed every-
where in the atmosphere. At each point, the temperature is
determined by the balance of Compton heating and cooling,
free-free heating and cooling, photoionization heating, and
radiative recombination cooling.

Because of its quadratic dependence on the density,
free-free (Bremsstrahlung) heating-cooling is expected to be
the dominant process leading temperature changes. Another
major eﬀect of high densities is the enhancement of the colli-
sional de-excitation, which in turn suppresses radiative cool-
ing, thus raising the temperature. Additionally, three-body
recombination becomes important at log(ne) ∼ 19, which
lowers the ionization state. Lower ionization translates into
larger photoionization heating.

All the relevant heating and cooling rates for the mod-
els mentioned above are plotted in Figure 3. Since we are
comparing models with the same ξ, a larger density im-
plies a larger ﬂux. A larger ﬂux increases the photoioniza-
tion as well as the Compton heating. However, these two
rates depend linearly on density, while the free-free heating
has a n2
e dependence. Compton heating and cooling scale
with neFx independently of the ionization or temperature,
but their contribution is small compared to the others. The
Bremsstrahlung cooling has an explicit dependence with the
temperature, thus its behavior is quite similar to that seen
in Figure 2. For log(ne) = 15 − 17, the free-free heating be-
comes dominant only in the inner part of the atmosphere,
at large τT. At the surface, photoionization heating is the
leading process.

2.2 Reﬂected Spectra

The reﬂected spectra corresponding to the temperature so-
lutions discussed in Section 2.1 are shown in Figure 4. For
simplicity we show the angle-averaged emitted spectrum at
the surface of the illuminated disk. Each curve is normal-
ized by an extra factor in ﬂux with respect to the model
for log(ne) = 15 such that all the continua are placed at

Figure 3. Various heating and cooling rates included in the reﬂection calculations shown in Figure 2. Each curve is normalized in
amplitude to match the extra factor in ﬂux and density with respect to the log(ne) = 15 case. Thus, the curves for log(ne) = 16, 17, 18
and 19 are divided by 102, 104, 106, and 108.

the same level (see Figure caption for details). The incident
power-law spectrum is also shown. While all the spectra are
similar at high energies ((cid:38) 5 keV), they show increasing
divergence at low energies.

The thermal part of the spectra at low energies fol-
lows the evolution of the temperature at the illuminated
zone of the atmosphere. For the three lowest densities, there
are not signiﬁcant changes in the observable X-ray band
(∼ 0.1− 200 keV). However, for log(ne) = 18 and above the
changes are dramatic. At 1 keV there is almost 1 order of
magnitude of diﬀerence in the reﬂected ﬂux. This increased
emission at soft energies agrees with the results ﬁrst reported
by Ballantyne (2004) in the context of neutron stars. The

changes in the Fe K region are minor, although we note
the suppression of the Kβ emission for the highest densities,
which indicates a higher ionization state.

Notably, the higher density models give a soft excess
which is much larger than for low density. The main eﬀect is
that as the density rises, the bremsstrahlung absorption in
the outer layers becomes increasingly important at lower en-
ergies. In the regions where free-free absorption is the dom-
inant source of opacity, the gas radiates like a blackbody at
the local temperature T . Thus, at low energies (E (cid:28) kT )
the emitted spectrum follows the Rayleigh-Jeans law I ∝ E2
(Felten & Rees 1972), causing the surface temperature to in-
crease.

models with log(ne) = 16, 17, 18 and 19, respectively.

In the non-relativistic limit we may approximate g ≈ 1.
Because the temperature in the illuminated region of the
slab is fairly constant, we can evaluate the expression above
for single values of density and temperature. Looking at the
region for τT (cid:46) 0.01 in the proﬁles of Figure 2, we ﬁnd
E∗ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.8 and 2 keV for log(ne) = 15 − 19,
respectively. For all energies below E∗, χﬀ is the dominant
opacity. Note that these energies are approximate, and in
fact for energies above ∼ 0.1 keV the photoelectric opacity
from the various metals becomes important. However, this
simple derivation explains the Rayleigh-Jeans shape of the
reﬂected spectrum at low energies.

The diﬀerences observed in the reﬂected spectra are a
direct consequence of the eﬀects of high-density in the ion-
ization balance of the illuminated atmosphere. This is illus-
trated in Figure 5, where we plot the ionic fractions for H

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

and all ions of H, O, and Fe (the most abundant elements),
for three of the calculations presented above, namely for
those with log(ne) = 15, 17, and 19. The evolution in the
ionization structure with increasing density is quite evident.

At log(ne) = 15 (upper panels of Figure 5), H and He
are fully ionized in the illuminated hot region near the sur-
face, and then recombine at a small depth (τT ∼ 0.1), which
is the region where the temperature drops most rapidly (Fig-
ure 2). This transition is followed by other ions. H-like oxy-
gen is dominant in most of the hot region, while neutral O
dominates in the colder region. Likewise, Fe xviii and Fe xix
are present near the surface, while deep inside only Fe ii and
Fe iii are observed. This structure is dramatically changed
at higher densities. For log(ne) = 17, the inner regions are
dominated by O iv, Fe v, and Fe vi. At log(ne) = 19, oxygen
is fully ionized in the entire slab, while the lowest ionization
stages of iron are Fe xvii, Fe xvi, and Fe xv. These changes
in ionic fractions aﬀect both the photoelectric opacity and
line emission, which has direct impact on the emitted spec-
trum. In general, higher density results in a hotter and more
ionized atmosphere.

3 DISCUSSION

3.1 Observational Implications for AGN

We have shown in Section 2 that high-density eﬀects are
very important in the calculation of X-ray reﬂected spectra.
The net result is a very signiﬁcant increase in the continuum
ﬂux at energies below ∼ 2 keV. This eﬀect could have impor-
tant observational implications. For example, the observed
X-ray spectrum from many AGN often presents an emission
excess at ∼ 1 keV, referred to as the soft-excess (Turner &
Pounds 1988). The nature of this emission is still a matter
of debate. Possible explanations include Comptonized emis-
sion (Titarchuk 1994), reﬂection-reprocessed emission (Va-
sudevan et al. 2014), or complex absorption (Sobolewska &
Done 2007). The calculations presented in this paper sug-
gest that the soft-excess could be a measure of the density
in the accretion disk, which provides a great diagnostic tool.
High-density eﬀects are also important in extreme cases
where the illuminating source is very close to the black hole,
which enhances the reﬂection signal (Dauser et al. 2014).
Recently, Kara et al. (2015) analyzed NuSTAR and XMM-
Newton observations of the narrow-line Seyfert I galaxy
1H0707–495. Fits using the relxilllp model (i.e., relativis-
tic reﬂection under a lampost geometry), constrained the

height of the corona to be roughly 2rg (where rg = GM/c2
is the gravitational radius), and a large reﬂection fraction
Rf > 5.8, which indicates a very strong illumination. How-
ever, the ionization parameter was found to be moderate
(between log ξ = 0.3 to log ξ = 2 depending on the data
set analyzed), which can only be explained by the density
being high. Using the observed luminosity and the given
ionization parameter, Kara et al. estimated a density of
ne ∼ 1017 cm−3.

3.2 A Simple Test on 1H0707–495

In order to test the impact of high-density reﬂection mod-
els in ﬁtting observational data, we have performed a sim-
ple analysis of one observation of 1H0707–495. We used the
∼ 500 ks exposure from the XMM-Newton observation of the
source collected between 2008 January 29 and 2008 Febru-
ary 6, using only the European Photon Imaging Camera
(EPIC)-pn (Str¨uder et al. 2001). This is same observation
analyzed by Dauser et al. (2012), where the details on the
data reduction are provided.

Additionally, we have produced a full grid of reﬂection
models for high-density atmospheres with our code xillver.

(i.e., the largest value considered in the discussion of Sec-
tion 2), with a high-energy cutoﬀ ﬁxed at 300 keV. The
ﬁnal grid of models contains a total of 9000 spectra cov-
ering a wide range of parameters: the slope of the illumi-
nating power-law (1.2 (cid:54) Γ (cid:54) 3.4), the Fe abundance in
solar units (0.5 (cid:54) AFe (cid:54) 20), the ionization parameter
(0 (cid:54) log ξ (cid:54) 4.7), and the inclination (5 (cid:54) i (cid:54) 89).

The spectrum of 1H0707–495 has been previously an-
alyzed by several authors (e.g. Fabian et al. 2009; Zoghbi
et al. 2010; Dauser et al. 2012; Kara et al. 2015). In general,
the spectrum is found to be dominated by reﬂection, with
a power-law continuum much steeper than generally found
in AGN (Γ (cid:46) 3). Surprisingly, the Fe abundance is always
required to be super-solar, with values as large as 10 to 20
times the solar value. Most ﬁts require either a strong ther-
mal component (in the form of a blackbody), or two diﬀerent
reﬂection components. Given all these complexities, we do
not seek to provide yet another detailed analysis of this pe-
culiar source, but rather to use it as a simple test case for
the high-density reﬂection models.

Therefore, we start by ﬁtting the 2–10 keV energy band
with a power-law continuum plus relativistically smeared re-
ﬂection (both components provided by our model relxill).
In addition, the model includes Galactic absorption (mod-
eled with Tbabs), intrinsic absorption at the redshift of the
source (modeled with zTbabs, with z = 0.0411). We perform
two ﬁts, one with the standard xillver grid (i.e., calculated
with ne = 1015 cm−3), and one with the high-density grid
(ne = 1019 cm−3). Both models provide a reasonably good
ﬁt for the data, with a reduced chi-square of χ2
ν = 1.31
and χ2
ν = 1.28 for the low and high density models, respec-
tively, with all parameters between the two models consis-
tent within their uncertainties.

We then include the soft-energy data (i.e., the 0.3–2 keV
region), without re-ﬁtting. Figure 6 shows the data-to-model
ratio plot in these two cases. Interestingly, the high-density
model makes a huge improvement in the soft band, decreas-
ing the statistics from χ2
ν = 629.3 for the low-density model,
to χ2
ν = 215.4 for the high-density model. Meanwhile, there
is virtually no eﬀect in the 2–10 keV region.

An obvious question arises from this analysis: will an
even higher density improve further the ﬁt of the soft-
energies? Unfortunately, limitations in the current atomic
data prevent us from producing models at densities above
log(ne) ∼ 18 − 19. This issue is further discussed in Sec-
tion 3.4.

3.3 Observational Implications for BHB

We have discussed so far calculations appropriate for the
modeling of the X-ray reﬂection spectrum of AGN, i.e.,
steeper continua (Γ ∼ 2) and relatively low ionization
(log ξ ∼ 0 − 2). Nevertheless, relativistic reﬂection is also
commonly observed in the spectra of many BHB (e.g. Parker
et al. 2015; Garc´ıa et al. 2015; Miller & Miller 2015), which
in general show a harder continuum and a higher ionization
parameter (log ξ (cid:38) 3).

Figure 7 shows the resulting temperature proﬁles and
reﬂected spectra for models with Γ = 1.6 and ξ =
103 erg cm s−1. All other parameters are the same as those
for the models presented in Section 2 (Figures 2 and 4). The

High-Density Eﬀects on X-ray Reﬂection

Figure 6. Ratio plots of the ﬁts to the XMM-Newton data of
1H0707–495, using the relativistic reﬂection model relxill for
log(ne) = 15 (blue points), and for log(ne) = 19 (red points).
Only the 2–10 keV band is actually ﬁtted, while the soft energies
are included after the ﬁt to illustrate the impact of the high-
density model in that spectral band.

eﬀects of high-density are less prominent at higher ioniza-
tion. The temperature near the surface remains fairly con-
stant regardless of the density, most likely because all el-
ements are fully stripped and line cooling is already sup-
pressed (unlike the case for low ξ). The temperature in the
inner regions rises with density, due to the increase of the
free-free heating, just as in the low-ionization models. Once
again, the most signiﬁcant eﬀect in the reﬂected spectra
(right panel) is the modiﬁcation of the Rayleigh-Jeans do-
main of the emission at soft-energies. The most prominent
features are the O Ly α line at ∼0.8 keV, and the Fe K-shell
emission at ∼6.7 keV. The continuum between these two fea-
tures grow with increasing density due to the reduction of
the photoelectric opacity. However, the overall shape of the
spectrum above ∼1 keV is very similar among all models.
In the standard α-disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev
1973), the midplane density of the accretion disk around
a stellar-mass black hole is a few orders of magnitude larger
than in a disk around a supermassive black hole, simply
because the density scales proportional to m−1r3/2, where
m is the black hole mass and r the radius. Moreover, esti-
mates of the gas density using multi-dimensional magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations can produce midplane
densities (cid:38) 1020 cm−3 for a 10 M(cid:12)black hole accreting
at 10% the Eddington luminosity (e.g. Noble et al. 2010;
Schnittman et al. 2013).

In the soft and intermediate states, the power-law con-
tinuum is steep and a strong thermal disk component domi-
nates X-ray spectrum, which in some cases makes the detec-
tion of the reﬂection signatures challenging. However, in the
hard state the thermal emission becomes faint and the spec-
trum is characterized by a harder (Γ < 2) power-law con-
tinuum with a high-energy cutoﬀ. This continuum can typ-
ically be well described by Comptonization of soft thermal
disk photons in a hot, optically-thin corona. Many sources
show clear reﬂection features in the hard state.
In some cases, a weak and relatively cold disk (T ∼

0.2 keV) component has been found in the hard-state spec-
tra of some sources (e.g., GX 339–4 Reis et al. 2008; Plant
et al. 2015). While the high-density eﬀects appear to be
milder in BHB models than in those for AGN, we do not
discount the possibility that the faint soft emission observed
in some BHB is due to a high-density reﬂector. A detailed
analysis of these new models confronted with real observa-
tional data is required to answer this question, but outside
the scope of this paper. Moreover, as discussed above, den-
sities even larger than ones covered in the present calcula-
tions might be more appropriate to correctly represent the
physics near stellar-mass black holes. Such calculations are
currently infeasible due to the lack of proper atomic data
(see Section 3.4).

3.4 Limitations of the Atomic Data

The xillver reﬂection calculations presented here make
use of the subroutines of the photoionization code XSTAR
(Kallman & Bautista 2001), as well as its atomic database
(Bautista & Kallman 2001). These are used for the calcu-
lation of the ionization and thermal balance, plus line and
continuum emissivities and opacities. While XSTAR incorpo-
rates the most complete atomic database currently available
for the modeling of X-ray spectra, it is also limited to den-
sities below 1018 cm−3.

At high densities, electrons in bound states require less
energy to liberate them into the continuum than equivalent
states in isolated atoms, because ions see the charge from
neighboring ions and electrons, which eﬀectively depresses
the ionization potential. This eﬀect is called continuum low-
ering. Current calculations of ionization balance do not take
this process into account in a comprehensive way. In our
case, XSTAR contains a comprehensive and accurate treat-
ment of continuum lowering for the H- and He-like isoelec-
tronic sequences, and they are only applicable up to densities
of 1018 cm3. Plus, XSTAR utilizes low density recombination
rates for ions from all other isoelectronic sequences, i.e. any
ion with three or more electrons.

Three-body recombination is the inverse process of col-

lisional ionization, and can aﬀect all atomic levels given suﬃ-
ciently high densities. It occurs when an electron approaches
an ion with kinetic energy less than the binding energy of the
recombined level, and that when second electron is within
the same volume in order to carry away the liberated en-
ergy. This process is currently not included for all levels,
but only to those excited levels most easily excited from the
ground level by electron collisions. This is supplemented by
those levels which can be populated by radiative recombina-
tion. As three-body recombination occurs preferentially to
highly excited levels, the line emission from these levels can
be strongly enhanced at high-densities.

The emission of X-ray lines depends on the rates from
many processes, including photoionization, radiative and di-
electronic recombination, electron impact collisional excita-
tion and ionization, Auger decay and autoionization, and
bound-bound radiative decay. Plasma density can aﬀect all
of these, in principle, via eﬀects of screening the nuclear
charge on atomic structure. This can lead to rate coeﬃcients
which can be either larger or smaller than the low density
rates.

Stimulated processes will enhance the rates for recom-
bination and radiative decay at high-densities, and it is
straightforward to include in the calculation of level pop-
ulations. However, so far XSTAR only includes this for re-
combination, given the current limitation to densities below
1018 cm3 (i.e., stimulated processes become important at
larger densities).

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have explored the eﬀects of high densities on models of
photoionized plasmas and reﬂection spectra. The primary
eﬀect of increasing the density is the suppression of line
cooling near the disk’s surface, and the increase of free-free
heating in the deeper regions, which results in an increase
of the gas temperature. These eﬀects in turn aﬀect the ion-
ization balance, typically increasing the ionization state of
the gas as the density increases. The most obvious eﬀect on

sion at low energies, which follows a Rayleigh-Jeans law.
Additionally, the higher temperature also results in a higher
ionization state, thereby aﬀecting the emission line spectrum
and continuum photoelectric absorption.

In the context of AGN, the enhanced emission at low
energies could explain to some degree the soft excess ob-
served in many sources. Higher densities might also explain
the blackbody component that is required in ﬁts to the spec-
tra of extreme narrow-line Seyfert I AGN such as 1H0707–
495 (Fabian et al. 2009) and IRAS13224–3809 (Ponti et al.
2010), and possibly also ﬁts to data indicating the pres-
ence of a second reﬂector with higher ionization identiﬁed
by Dauser et al. (2012). Generally, the eﬀects of high density
are more dramatic for low ionization-state models.

High density models are also important when the illu-
mination of the inner disk is very strong. Speciﬁcally, for
bright AGN, with the illuminating source near the black
hole and moderate ionization, the density of the reﬂector is
expected to exceed the typical densities employed in stan-
dard reﬂection models (e.g., Parker et al. 2014; Kara et al.
2015).

As a ﬁrst step, using our code xillver we have pro-
duced a new library of reﬂection spectra that are publicly
available1. The grid of models is for a single high value of
the density, ne = 1019 cm−3, while covering wide ranges of
all the other relevant parameters (except for Ecut, which is
ﬁxed at 300 keV). This limited library of models is provided
to enable individuals to test whether a high-density model
of a peculiar source provides a better ﬁt to the data than
conventional reﬂection models. Ultimately, a large eﬀort will
be required to produce a comprehensive set of models that
accurately describe the microphysics associated with the ef-
fects of high density. To a degree, we expect the density to
be degenerate with the ionization parameter at some ener-
gies, though it may be possible to use the soft excess as a
discriminator.

The atomic data currently available is somewhat in-
complete and applicable only to plasma densities less than
ne = 1019 cm−3. This density limit imposes a serious limi-
tation on our reﬂection models since the densities in BHB
accretion disks are estimated to be signiﬁcantly higher. Sim-
ilarly, in other important environments the densities are
thought to be > ne = 1019 cm−3, such as the accretion
disks of neutron stars, the atmospheres of white dwarfs, and
partially ionized outﬂows from galactic sources (Miller et al.
2015). At such densities, much of the rate data in current
atomic databases is inapplicable and new atomic calcula-
tions are sorely needed.

A principal use of reﬂection models is in estimating the
spins of black holes where the ﬁts to data are driven by
the proﬁle of the Fe K emission line and edge. Fits to the
spectra of many sources have shown a clear correlation be-
tween the spin of the black hole and the abundance of Fe
(Reynolds et al. 2012; Steiner & McClintock 2012). More-
over, the abundances are typically signiﬁcantly greater than
the solar value. The AGN 1H0707–495 is the most dramatic
case with AFe ∼ 10 − 20 (Fabian et al. 2009; Dauser et al.
2012). Meanwhile, super-solar abundances are also inferred

in ﬁtting high-quality spectra of BHBs such as Cyg X-1
(Parker et al. 2015) and GX 339–4 (Fuerst et al. 2015; Garc´ıa
et al. 2015).

Because no concrete physical mechanism for extreme Fe
enrichment has been identiﬁed, it appears that there is a de-
ﬁciency in the models. In current reﬂection models, it is the
Fe-abundance parameter alone that controls the strength of
the line emission. A possible explanation for the super-solar
abundances is that current moderate-density models fail to
include a signiﬁcant line-production mechanism. It is imper-
ative to explore this possibility by identifying and accurately
including high-density plasma eﬀects in computing atomic
data, and then implementing these data in a new generation
of reﬂection models.

The development of accurate high-density reﬂection
models is now a priority given the broadband, high-
resolution, pile-up-free data that NuSTAR and the newly-
launched mission Hitomi (Astro-H; Takahashi et al. 2010)
are providing, and that NICER (Gendreau et al. 2012) will
soon provide. The latter two missions furthermore are sensi-
tive down to ∼ 0.2 keV, making their data ideal in searching
for the predicted signatures of high-density plasma eﬀects.
