ALE-SUPG ﬁnite element method for convection-
diﬀusion problems in time-dependent domains:
Non-conservative form

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Stability estimates for Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) ﬁ-
nite element method with diﬀerent time integration schemes for the solution of
a scalar transient convection-diﬀusion-reaction equation in a time-dependent do-
main are derived. The deformation of the domain is handled with the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach. In particular, the non-conservative form of
the ALE scheme is considered. The implicit Euler, the Crank-Nicolson, and the
backward-diﬀerence (BDF-2) methods are used for temporal discretization. It is
shown that the stability of the semi-discrete (continuous in time) ALE-SUPG
equation is independent of the mesh velocity, whereas the stability of the fully
discrete problem is only conditionally stable. The theoretical considerations are
illustrated by a numerical example. Further, the dependence of numerical solution
on the choice of stabilization parameter δk is also presented.

1 Introduction

Solution of a transient convection-diﬀusion-reaction equation in a time-dependent
domain is highly demanded in many applications. The scalar variable can be the
temperature, concentration or density etc. of a species. Numerical approxima-
tions of the scalar partial diﬀerential equations become more challenging when
the equation is convection dominated. Further, the computations become more

complex, when the domain contains moving boundaries e.g., ﬂuid-structure inter-
actions (FSI) problems. In addition to a stabilized numerical method, an eﬃcient
approach is necessary to handle the mesh movement for a convection dominated
convection-diﬀusion equation in time-dependent domains.

In general, the standard Galerkin ﬁnite element approximation induces spuri-
ous oscillations in the numerical solution of a convection dominated convection-
diﬀusion equation. Therefore, stabilization schemes such as streamline upwind
Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG)[3, 4, 13], the local projection stabilization (LPS) [2, 11,
15], the continuous interior penalty method (CIP) [5, 6], the subgrid scale mod-
eling (SGS) [12], and the orthogonal subscales method (OSS) [8, 7] have been
proposed and analyzed in the literature. Each of these methods has its own advan-
tages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, almost all stabilization methods introduce
an unknown numerical parameter that controls the stability. The choice of the
parameter for SUPG stabilization scheme has been studied in [13, 17, 18, 9].

The above mentioned stabilization methods are mostly studied only for PDEs
in stationary domains. In this paper, the SUPG ﬁnite element scheme for com-
putations of transient convection-diﬀusion equation in time-dependent domains is
presented. Further, the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach is used to
handle the moving boundaries and the time-dependent domain. The ALE formula-
tion introduces a convective domain/mesh velocity term into the model equation,
and hence it alters the overall convective ﬁeld of the problem. Nevertheless, the
model problem can still be convection dominated and can have boundary/interior
layers even after reformulating into an ALE form. The stability estimates for the
conservative ALE-SUPG approach with implicit Euler and Crank-Nicolson time
discretizations have been presented in our earlier work [10]. The considered non-
conservative ALE-SUPG formulation avoids the necessity of the Reynolds iden-
tity. The stability estimates for the implicit Euler, Crank-Nicolson and backward
diﬀerence time discretizations with inconsistent SUPG for non-conservative ALE
form of the convection-diﬀusion-reaction equation in time-dependent domains are
derived.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the transient convection-
diﬀusion equation in a time-dependent domain and its ALE formulation are given.
The spatial discretization using the SUPG ﬁnite element method is also presented
in this section. Further, the stability of the semi-discrete (in space) problem is de-
rived. Section 3 is devoted to the stability estimates of the fully discrete problem
with implicit Euler, Crank-Nicolson and backward diﬀerence (BDF-2) discretiza-
tion in time. The numerical results are presented in Section 4. Finally, a brief
summary is presented in Section 5.

Let Ωt be a time-dependent bounded domain in Rd, d = 2, 3 with Lipschitz
boundary ∂Ωt for each t ∈ [0, T]. Here, T is a given end time. Consider a transient

Here, u(t, x) is an unknown scalar function, u0(x) is a given initial data, ǫ is
the diﬀusivity constant, b(t, x) is the convective ﬂow velocity, c(t, x) is a reaction
function, f (x) is a given source term with f ∈ L2(Ωt).

2.1 ALE formulation

Let ˆΩ be a reference domain. The reference domain ˆΩ can simply be the initial
domain Ω0 or the previous time-step domain, when the deformation of the domain
is large. Let At be a family of bijective ALE mappings, which at each time t ∈
(0, T], maps a point Y of a reference domain ˆΩ to a point on the current domain
Ωt, given by

At : ˆΩ → Ωt,

At(Y ) = x(Y, t),

t ∈ (0, T).

Further, for any time t1, t2 ∈ [0, T], the ALE mapping between two time levels
will be given by,

A : Ωt1 → Ωt2

At1,t2 = At2 ◦ A−1
t1

The domain velocity w is deﬁned as

w(x, t) =

(A−1

t

(x), t).

∂x

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Y

We assume that Ωt is bounded with Lipschitz continuous boundary for each
t ∈ [0, T]. For a function g ∈ C 0(Ωt) on the Eulerian frame, we deﬁne the corre-
sponding function ˆg ∈ C 0( ˆΩ) on the ALE frame as

ˆg : ˆΩ × (0, T) → R,

ˆg := g ◦ At,

with

ˆg(Y, t) = g(At(Y ), t).

The temporal derivative on the ALE frame is deﬁned as

: Ωt × (0, T) → R,

(x, t) =

∂ˆg
∂t

(Y, t),

Y = A−1

∂g

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Y

This equation is the ALE counterpart of the model equation (1). The diﬀerence
between the equations (1) and (2) is the additional domain velocity in the ALE
form that accounts for the deformation of the domain.

2.2 Variational form

In this section, the ﬁnite element variational form of the ALE equation (2) is
derived. Let

V =nv ∈ H 1

0 (Ωt), v : Ωt × (0, T] → R, v = ˆv ◦ A−1

t

, ˆv ∈ H1

0( ˆΩ)o .

be the solution space for equation (2). Multiplying equation (2) with a test func-
tion v ∈ V and applying integration by parts to the higher order derivative term,
the variational form of the equation (2) becomes:

For given b, w, c, u0, Ω0 and f , ﬁnd u ∈ V such that for all t ∈ (0, T]

, v(cid:19) + (ǫ∇u, ∇v) + ((b − w) · ∇u, v) + (cu, v) = (f, v),

v ∈ V. (3)

Here, (·, ·) denotes the L2−inner product in Ωt.

2.3 SUPG ﬁnite element space discretization

The stability estimates for the standard Galerkin solution of (3) can be found in [1,
16, 14]. It has been shown that the stability inequality is independent of domain
velocity. However, the Galerkin approximation suﬀers instabilities for convection
dominant scalar equations of type (3). In order to overcome this, we use the SUPG
discretization for the considered ALE equation (3). Note that the convective ve-
locity in the ALE form is (b − w), whereas the convective velocity in ﬁxed domain
will be “b”.

Let Th,0 be the triangulation of initial domain Ω0. For each t ∈ (0, T], Th,t
denote the family of shape regular triangulations of Ωt into simplices obtained by
triangulating the time-dependent domain Ωt. We denote the diameter of the cell
K ∈ Th,t by hK,t and the global mesh size in the triangulated domain Ωh,t by
ht := max{hK,t
: K ∈ Th,t}. Suppose Vh ⊂ V is a conforming ﬁnite element
(ﬁnite dimensional) space. Let φh := φi(x), i = 1, 2, ..., N , be the ﬁnite element
basis functions of Vh. The discrete ﬁnite element space Vh is then deﬁned by

Vh =(cid:8)vh ∈ C(Ωt) : vh|∂Ωt = 0; vh|K ∈ Pk(K)(cid:9) ⊂ H 1

where Pk is the set of polynomials of degree less than or equal to k for discretization
of the ALE mapping in space. We next deﬁne the discrete ALE mapping Ah,t(Y )
and the mesh velocity wh in space. We use the Lagrangian ﬁnite element space

0 (Ωt).

Lk( ˆΩ) =nψ ∈ H k( ˆΩ) : ψ|K ∈ Pk( ˆK) for all ˆK ∈ ˆΩho ,

Using the linear space, we deﬁne the semidiscrete ALE mapping in space for each
t ∈ [0, T) by

(4)
Further, the semidiscrete (continuous in time) mesh velocity wh(t, Y ) ∈ L1( ˆΩ)d
in the ALE frame for each t ∈ [0, T) is deﬁned by

Ah,t : ˆΩh → Ωh,t.

ˆwh(t, Y ) =

M

Xi=1

wi(t)ψi(Y ); wi(t) ∈ Rd.

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

Here, wi(t) denotes the mesh velocity of the ith node of simplices at time t, and
ψi(Y ), i = 1, 2, ..., M, are the basis functions of L1( ˆΩh). We then deﬁne the
semidiscrete mesh velocity in the Eulerian frame as

wh(t, x) = ˆwh ◦ A−1

h,t(x).

Using the above ﬁnite element spaces and applying the inconsistent SUPG ﬁnite
element discretization to the ALE form (2), the semi-discrete form in space reads:

For a given uh(x, 0) = uh,0, b, wh, c, Ωh,0 and f , ﬁnd uh(t, x) ∈ Vh such that for
all t ∈ (0, T]

∂t Y

Here, δK is the local stabilization parameter, whose value depends on the mesh
size and the convective velocity. Further, uh,0 ∈ Vh is deﬁned as the L2-projection
of the initial value u0 onto Vh.

for equation (2.3) and following the similar procedure, as in the case of conservative
ALE formulation [10] in section (3), the stability estimate for the semi-discrete
problem can be derived. Hence the stability properties are not aﬀected by domain
velocity ﬁeld in the semi-discrete problem. However, we may not expect the same
result to be true for the fully discrete case.

3 Fully discrete scheme

In this section, the stability estimates for the fully discrete ALE-SUPG form is
derived. First, we consider the ﬁrst order implicit Euler for the temporal discretiza-
tion and then the second order modiﬁed Crank-Nicolson, and backward-diﬀerence
(BDF-2) method.

Consider the partition of time interval [0, T] as 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tN = T
into N equal time intervals. Let us denote the uniform time step by ∆t = τ n
h be the approximation of u(tn, x) in
= tn - tn−1, 1 ≤ n ≤ N . Further, let un
Vh ⊂ H 1
0 (Ωtn ), where Ωtn is the deforming domain at time t = tn. We ﬁrst
discretize the ALE mapping in time using a linear interpolation. We denote the
discrete ALE mapping by Ah,∆t, and deﬁne it for every τ ∈ [tn, tn+1] by

Ah,∆t(Y ) =

τ − tn

∆t

Ah,tn+1(Y ) +

tn+1 − τ

∆t

Ah,tn (Y ),

where Ah,t(Y ) is the time continuous ALE mapping deﬁned in (4). Since the ALE
mapping is discretized in time using a linear interpolation, we obtain the discrete
mesh velocity

Ah,tn+1(Y ) − Ah,tn (Y )

the Eulerian frame as

Remark 1 The stability estimates for the consistent ALE SUPG, with the transient

diﬀers only by a constant multiplication of right hand side terms. Here, the proof
is not given for the sake of brevity.

4 Numerical results

This section presents the numerical results for the proposed SUPG ﬁnite element
schemes. We consider a boundary and interior layer problem in a time-dependent
domain. The piecewise quadratic ﬁnite elements are used for the spatial discretiza-
tion. The ﬁrst order backward Euler and second order Crank-Nicolson method
are used for the temporal discretization. Numerical solution obtained with the
standard Galerkin and the SUPG method are presented. All computations are
performed using an unstructured triangular mesh.

4.1 Example

In this example, a typical ﬂuid structure interaction problem, that is a ﬂow pass-
ing through a rectangular structure (beam), which deforms with time, has been
considered. A predeﬁned adaptive mesh with a high resolution near the deforming
structure is considered. Nevertheless, the mesh is comparatively coarser away from
the structure. Further, the tip of the beam is considered to be semi-circular to do
away with the singularities that might occur due to the sharp corners. The mesh
movement is handled using the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) approach.

The ﬂow is being directed by a prescribed sinusoidal movement of the beam,

and is given by

d = 0.75(x − 0.5)2 sin(2πt/5),

θ = tan−1(cid:18) y

x − 0.5(cid:19) .

Here, the time-dependent coordinates (x1, x2) are deﬁned as

x(Y, t) = At(Y ) :(cid:26) x1 = Y1 + 0.05(0.25 d tan θ − Y2 sin θ)

x2 = Y2 + 0.05d.

Now, let the time-dependent rectangular structure (beam)

ΩS

t := {(−0.5, 0.5) × (−0.5, 0.5)} ∪ {(0.5, 4.5) × (−0.03, 0.03)}

and the two-dimensional channel that excludes the oscillating beam ΩS
t

is,

Ωt := {(−5, 18) × (−5, 5)} \ ¯ΩS
t .

Further, we deﬁne ΓN := {15} × (−5, 5) as the out ﬂow boundary and ΓD :=
∂Ωt \ ΓN as the Dirichlet boundary.

on the Dirichlet boundary. Since the solid beam bends (up and down) periodically,
the position of the boundary and the interior layers also changes with time. The

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

17

computations are performed until the dimensionless time T = 10 with the time
step ∆t = 0.01. We use the elastic-solid update technique to handle the mesh
movement that occurs due to the oscillations of the solid disc see [10]. At each
time step, we ﬁrst compute the displacement of the disc. We then solve the linear
elastic equation in Ωtn to compute the inner points’ displacement by considering
the displacement on ∂ΩS
tn+1 as the Dirichlet value. This elastic update technique
avoids the re-meshing during the entire simulation.

As expected the solution obtained with the standard Galerkin discretization
consists spurious oscillations and instabilities, see the Galerkin solution in ﬁgure 3.
We next perform an array of computations with diﬀerence values of δ0. The ob-
served undershoots and the overshoots for diﬀerent values of δ0 are plotted in
Figure 1 and 2, respectively. It is observed that the undershoots and overshoots
are less in the Euler’s method (note that the scaling of ﬁgures are diﬀerent). Apart
from that increasing value of δ0 will improve the undershoots/overshoots more in
case of implicit Euler than that of Crank-Nicolson scheme. So the optimal choice
(based on the undershoots and overshoots), for both the Euler and Crank-Nicolson
methods is δ0 = 5. The sequence of solutions obtained with the SUPG discretiza-
tion at diﬀerent instances t = 0.05, 3.9, 6.2, 10 are plotted in Figure 4. Though,
the SUPG approximation suppressed the spurious oscillations in the numerical
solution almost, there are very small overshoots and undershoots (around 10%)
for the chosen δ0 = 5. We could reduce these undershoots and overshoots by in-
creasing of δ0 further, however, it will smear the solution. This is a well known
behavior of the SUPG method in stationary domains. Nevertheless, the purpose
of the stabilized approximation is achieved, and SUPG discretization can be used
for boundary and interior layer problems in time-dependent domains to obtain a
stable solution.

5 Summary

ALE-SUPG ﬁnite element scheme for convection dominated transient convection-
diﬀusion equation in time-dependent domains is presented in this paper. The
deformation of the domain is handled using the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian
(ALE) approach. The stability estimates of the backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson
and backward diﬀerence(BDF-2) temporal discretizations with non-conservative
ALE-SUPG ﬁnite element method are derived. The scheme is validated with ﬂow
over an oscillating beam with convection dominant case. Further, the inﬂuence
of the SUPG stabilization parameter on the solution with ALE-SUPG ﬁnite ele-
ment scheme is presented. It is observed that the Crank-Nicolson scheme is less
dissipative than the Implicit Euler method. Further, the inﬂuence of the SUPG
stabilization method diﬀers in the backward Euler and Cranck-Nicolson methods.
The undershoots/overshoots in the backward Euler scheme is more sensitive to
the stabilization parameter δk than in the Crank-Nicolson scheme.
