1. Introduction

Consider an inﬁnite dimensional Banach space X. Denote by L(X) the Banach
algebra of all bounded linear operators on X, and by K(X) the ideal of the compact
operators in L(X).
Given A ∈ L(X), a fundamental problem of (linear) numerical mathematics is to
approximate the solution of the operator equation

Au = v,

for given v ∈ X.

A standard procedure is to choose a sequence of projections Pn which converge in
some sense to the identity operator, and a sequence of operators An : im Pn → im Pn
such that the AnPn converge to A, and to replace equation (1) with the “simpler”
equations

Anun = Pnv

for n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(2)
the solutions un being sought in im Pn. The crucial question is if this method applies
to A, i.e. if the Equations (2) possess unique solutions un for every right-hand side
v and for every suﬃciently large n, and if these solutions un converge to the solution
u of the original Equation (1). It is easy to see that the applicability of the method
is equivalent to the stability of the sequence {An} by which we mean that there
is an n0 ∈ N such that for n > n0 the operators An are invertible and the norms
of the inverses are uniformly bounded. On the other hand, it is well known that
the invertibility of A is not enough to guaranty the applicability of the method or
the stability of the sequence. A related problem, which originates from statistical
physics where ﬁnite-dimensional systems of very large dimension (on the order of
108) appear, is to infer properties of the large ﬁnite-dimensional operator from its
inﬁnite-dimensional counterpart.

The projections Pn are chosen depending on the space X, the operator A, and
the purpose for studying (1). If X is a Lebesgue function space, typical projections
are related to spline approximation methods or the ﬁnite section method (FSM). For
function spaces on the real line, the projections associated with the FSM are simply
the operators Pn := χ[−n,n]I of multiplication with the characteristic functions of the
interval [−n, n], respectively.
Approximation methods have been studied since the mid 1970s by many authors
with the use of the so-called algebraic techniques. The main idea is to embed the
approximation sequence {An}n∈N in a certain algebra of approximation sequences, in
which the applicability of the method is easily related to an invertibility problem in
that algebra. The application of Banach algebra techniques to singular integral and
convolution operators of increasing complexity in several directions (from continuous
coeﬃcients or symbols, to piecewise continuous, slowly oscillating, almost-periodic
and so on; similarly from the Cauchy singular integral operators, to Wiener-Hopf,
then Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators, or even algebras generated by such opera-
tors) ﬁrst on the Lebesgue space L2(R) (resulting in C∗-algebras), then on Lp(R) for
1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ has led to a great increase in the technical diﬃculty of the proofs.
Our main objective in this paper is in a sense to apply a simpler but more
powerful and robust variant of the algebraic technique that is capable of solving the
applicability problem with the greatest generality in terms of spaces, symbols and
coeﬃcients and with much simpler proofs.

2

We will prove the following main result, which shows that for a large class of oper-
ators, the ﬁnite section method is applicable if and only if the operator is invertible.
In the other cases our method gives the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the
applicability of the FSM, in terms of the invertibility of an additional collection of
operators, each a homomorphic image of the original approximation sequence, which
we call snapshots.
Theorem 1. Let A be an operator with its related ﬁnite section sequence A = {An}
belonging to a certain class A1. Then the Finite Section Method applies to A if and
only if all snapshots are invertible in L(X).

The class A1 of Theorem 1 covers ﬁnite section sequences of sums and products of
multiplication operators and convolution operators, with highly discontinuous gener-
ating functions, including L∞ functions with limits at inﬁnity for the multiplication
operators and slowly oscillating, almost periodic and piecewise continuous functions
for the convolution operators, which can be present together for the ﬁrst time.1

We believe that the ideas described here can be used with advantage over the tra-
ditional algebraic methods to study spline approximation methods, or approximation
methods in many other spaces.

The paper is organized as follows:

in the next section we introduce deﬁnitions
and some basic results for the function and multiplier spaces. We use in some cases
simpler deﬁnitions than before, and discuss their relation with the classically deﬁned
spaces. We also review the previous results regarding the ﬁnite section method for
convolution-type operators, and introduce the P-framework, which is the basis of the
new approach. We ﬁnish the section by discussing the classes of operators that can
be included in the P-framework. In the third section, which is the core of the paper,
we introduce the notion of rich sequences and develop the whole algebraic procedure
until proving the main result in several versions, one of them even including the ﬂip
operator. Finally, in the last section, we compare the new results with the older ones
and discuss the change of paradigm which results from the present approach.

2. Some basic concepts

We collect in this section some deﬁnitions, concepts and base results that are
needed in the latter part of the work and prove some new and highly interesting
results on the classiﬁcation of convolution operators. We also give very brieﬂy some
pointers to the history of the use of algebraic techniques in approximation methods.

2.1. Function algebras

Let’s start with the deﬁnition of piecewise continuous, slowly oscillating, uni-
formly continuous and almost periodic functions. All function algebras here are
considered as subalgebras of L∞(R). We represent the one-point compactiﬁcation of
the real line by ˙R.

• For λ ∈ ˙R let PCλ be set of all functions being continuous on ˙R \ {λ} and
having ﬁnite one-sided limits at λ. Similarly, SOλ is the set of all functions
being continuous on ˙R \ {λ} and slowly oscillating at λ, i.e.

lim
x→+0

if λ ∈ R
osc(f, λ + ([−x,−rx] ∪ [rx, x])) = 0
x→+∞ osc(f, [−x,−rx] ∪ [rx, x]) = 0 if λ = ∞
lim

for every r ∈ (0, 1), where osc(f, I) := esssup{|f (t) − f (s)| : t, s ∈ I}.
• By PC we denote the smallest closed algebra including all PCλ, λ ∈ ˙R, and by
SO we denote the smallest closed algebra including all SOλ, λ ∈ ˙R.
The deﬁnitions of SOλ and SO are the ones used in the works of Y. Karlovich

(where SO is denoted there by SO(cid:5), see for instance [19]).

The deﬁnition of PC is not the usual one, but it is chosen here for two reasons:
Firstly it gives the deﬁnitions of PC and SO in a uniﬁed and consistent picture,
and secondly it is much more convenient for the subsequent proofs. Actually, this
characterization of PC is equivalent to the classical deﬁnition:
Lemma 2. The algebra PC is exactly the algebra of the functions with ﬁnite one-
sided limits at each point x ∈ ˙R.
Proof. Since the generators of PC have ﬁnite one-sided limits at each point, the
inclusion “⊂” is obvious. Conversely, let f be piecewise continuous in this latter
sense. For any prescribed  > 0 the set of points x ∈ ˙R with |f (x+) − f (x−)| > 
is ﬁnite (Otherwise, if it was inﬁnite, it would have an accumulation point in the
(compact) set ˙R, at which the one-sided limits cannot exist.) For each closed interval
I between such two points we proceed as follows: For each interior point x ∈ I
deﬁne yx := (f (x−) + f (x+))/2 and choose an open neighborhood of x such that
(cid:107)f − yx(cid:107) <  on this neighborhood. At the endpoints of I do this for yx being the
respective one-sided limit. These open sets cover I. By compactness we can choose
a ﬁnite subcovering, and ﬁnally let gI be the linear interpolation of all the respective
yxi on I with the respective one-sided limits of f at the boundary of I. Combining
these gI to one function g over ˙R we arrive at (cid:107)f − g(cid:107)∞ ≤ 2. Since g has only
ﬁnitely many discontinuities,  is arbitrary and PC is closed, we are done.

4

By L∞

0 we abbreviate the set of all functions a ∈ L∞(R) with

a(±∞) = lim

x→±∞ a(x) = 0.

Finally, denote by BUC the set (actually the Banach algebra) of all bounded and
uniformly continuous functions on R, by C(R) the subalgebra of all continuous func-
tions a with ﬁnite limits a(−∞) and a(+∞), and by C( ˙R) the subalgebra of those
continuous functions with ﬁnite limit a(−∞) = a(+∞) at inﬁnity. AP shall stand
for the smallest closed subalgebra which contains all functions x (cid:55)→ eiλx, λ ∈ R. Its
elements are called almost periodic functions. Clearly, C( ˙R) ⊂ C(R) ⊂ BUC and
AP ⊂ BUC as well as SO∞
2.2. Multiplier algebras

⊂ BUC.

Let F : L2(R) → L2(R) denote the Fourier transform
x ∈ R,

(F u)(x) :=(cid:90)R

u(t)eitxdt,

and F −1 : L2(R) → L2(R) the inverse of F . A function a ∈ L∞(R) is called a Fourier
multiplier on Lp(R), 1 < p < ∞,2 if the operator

(W 0(a)u)(x) := (F −1aF u)(x),

u ∈ L2(R) ∩ Lp(R),

acts on the dense subset L2(R) ∩ Lp(R) such that (cid:107)W 0(a)u(cid:107)Lp(R) ≤ cp(cid:107)u(cid:107)Lp(R) with
some constant cp independent of u. Then W 0(a) extends to a bounded linear operator
on Lp(R). This extension will again be denoted by W 0(a) and is referred to as the
Fourier convolution operator with the symbol function a.

Notice that all convolution operators are shift invariant, i.e. VsW 0(b)V−s = W 0(b)

for all s ∈ R, with the so-called shift operators Vs deﬁned by
Vs : Lp(R) → Lp(R), f (x) (cid:55)→ f (x − s).

By a theorem of Hörmander ([16]), also the converse is true: every shift invariant
operator A ∈ L(Lp(R)) is a Fourier convolution operator.

The set of all multipliers on Lp(R)

M p := {a ∈ L∞(R) : W 0(a) ∈ L(Lp(R))}

2The cases p ∈ {1,∞} have already been completely settled in [23]. Therefore we can focus on

1 < p < ∞ in the present paper.

is known to be a Banach algebra with the norm (cid:107)a(cid:107)M p := (cid:107)W 0(a)(cid:107)L(Lp(R)), and
particularly includes x (cid:55)→ − sgn(x) for every 1 < p < ∞, the symbol of the Cauchy
singular integral operator S : Lp(R) → Lp(R)
πi(cid:90)R

u(y)

x ∈ R.

(Su)(x) :=

This yields e.g.

Let p ∈ (1,∞) \ {2}. By M <p> we denote the set of all multipliers b ∈ M p for
which there exists a δ > 0 (depending on b) such that b ∈ M r for all r ∈ (p− δ, p + δ).
Also set M <2> := M 2 = L∞(R). Furthermore, for a subalgebra B ⊂ L∞(R) let Bp
denote the closure in M p of B ∩ M <p>.
the algebra PCp of piecewise continuous (which particularly
contains − sgn, the symbol of the Cauchy singular integral operator) and the algebra
SOp of slowly oscillating multipliers (which includes the algebra SO(cid:5)
p deﬁned in [19]).
Actually, we are going to attack a larger algebra within this paper: Let [PC, SO, BUC]
stand for the smallest closed algebra which includes all PC-, SO-, and BUC-functions,
(hence also all AP-functions), we are then interested in all multipliers belonging to
[PC, SO, BUC]p.

Notice that the deﬁnitions of these algebras are intuitive, simple and short, and
one might ask whether they are equivalent to the classical approach and the more
technical deﬁnitions in the literature. We have the following result, whose proof is
trivial.

Lemma 3. The algebra PCp includes the smallest closed subalgebra of M p that is
generated by all C( ˙R)p-functions and all χ[λ,∞), λ ∈ R. Moreover, it includes the
smallest closed subalgebra of M p that contains all piecewise constant functions having
only ﬁnitely many discontinuities.

Also, PCp ⊃ PCλ

p and SOp ⊃ SOλ

p for every λ ∈ R.

Remark 4. These new deﬁnitions suggest the following open questions:

p and SOp,

p functions is suﬃcient to generate PCp,

1. whether the collection of all PCλ
2. the same question for SOλ
3. whether C( ˙R)p is a proper subset of C( ˙R) ∩ M p,
4. the same questions for SOp and PCp,
5. whether SOp is larger than the algebra SO(cid:5)
Anyway, the more elegant deﬁnitions in the present paper cover (and probably

p deﬁned in [19].

generalize, depending on the answers to the questions above) all previous ones.

2.3. The Finite Section Method in algebras of convolution operators

Let P := (Pn) be the sequence of projections Pn = χ[−n,n]I on the space Lp(R)

and consider the Finite Section Method

PnAPnun = Pnv

for n = 1, 2, . . .

(3)

for an operator A.

The applicability and properties of the FSM described above, and its discrete
analogue in sequence spaces caught the interest of a large number of researchers that
have obtained and extended results in various directions since at least the 1960s up
to the present: various types of symbols and operators [4, 10, 18, 22, 31, 33, 40], mul-
tidimensional case [3, 6, 14, 20, 24], spline methods [10, 14, 17, 36], Toeplitz, Hankel
and other operators [26, 29, 30], asymptotics, behavior of eigenvalues, approximation
numbers and numerical ranges [2, 9, 12, 28, 35, 41], structure of the approximation
algebras [1, 11, 37], are just some examples. The above references are far from being
exhaustive, see also the monographs [7, 8, 15, 25, 27, 32] and the references cited
therein.

Gohberg and Feldman [13] were the ﬁrst to obtain conditions for the applicabil-
ity of the method for some classes of continuous symbol convolution operators on
Lp(R), and Kozak [21] introduced the algebraic approach. Another important early
milestone for tackling piecewise continuous generating functions was Silbermann’s
paper [40] where he found a compact-like ideal of sequences and a corresponding
snapshot, so that the stability problem could be decomposed into the invertibility
of the snapshot and invertibility of the coset in the quotient algebra. That idea
has been used ever since, usually complemented by localization techniques to ﬁnd
invertibility conditions for the coset.

When Pn is strongly convergent most proofs make use of the close relationship
between strong convergence and the ideal of compact operators. In this context, the
observation that the multiplication of a strongly convergent sequence by a compact
operator gives uniform convergence plays a fundamental role. For non-strongly con-
vergent projections, as it is the case for the ﬁnite section projections in l∞(Z) or
L∞(R), S. Roch and B. Silbermann [34] (see also [25, 4.36 et seq.]) initiated the
idea of changing the above mentioned connection between compactness and strong
convergence to a deﬁnition. Starting with the projection sequence P := (Pn)n∈N, one
substitutes the usual compact operators by compact-like operators related to that
sequence. The P-compact operators will be those operators K ∈ L(X) such that
(cid:107)KPn − K(cid:107) and (cid:107)PnK − K(cid:107) tend to zero as n → ∞.
This new approach with the adapted ideal of P-compact operators happens to also
be useful in the cases 1 < p < ∞, and is at the heart of the results we present. In [23]

7

the authors managed to use the new approach to get, besides the complete solution
for the cases p ∈ {1,∞}, the solution for the so-called quasi-banded operators, which
include all convolutions with generating function continuous at all ﬁnite points of R,
but do not include the general piecewise continuous case. The present work purposes
to bring the P-framework together with localization techniques in order to cover for
the ﬁrst time quasi-banded operators and operators of convolution with piecewise
continuous generating functions.
2.4. The P-framework and Fredholm property
such that

Let X be a Banach space and P = (Pn)n∈N a sequence of projections Pn ∈ L(X)
1. PnPn+1 = Pn+1Pn = Pn for all n ∈ N,
2. limn→∞ (cid:107)Pnx(cid:107) = (cid:107)x(cid:107) for each x ∈ X,
3. (cid:107)(cid:80)i∈U (Pi − Pi−1)(cid:107) = 1 for every ﬁnite subset U ⊂ N.
Although these conditions seem to be somewhat technical at a ﬁrst glance, they
actually have a very natural meaning: the projections are nested (1.), cover the whole
space (2.), and provide a uniformly bounded partition (3.), in a sense. Therefore P
is said to be a uniform approximate identity. For a rigorous treatment (in an even
more relaxed setup) we refer to [27, 39]. In fact, recall from [27] that the set
K(X,P) := {K ∈ L(X) : (cid:107)K(I − Pn)(cid:107),(cid:107)(I − Pn)K(cid:107) → 0 as n → ∞}

of all P-compact operators is a Banach algebra. Further we denote the set of all
operators which are compatible with K(X,P) by

L(X,P) := {A ∈ L(X) : AK, KA ∈ K(X,P) for every K ∈ K(X,P)}.

It is known that L(X,P) is a Banach algebra as well, and K(X,P) forms a closed
two-sided ideal in L(X,P).
An operator A ∈ L(X,P) is said to be P-Fredholm if there exists a P-regularizer
B ∈ L(X), that is, AB − I, BA − I ∈ K(X,P). These P-regularizers belong
to L(X,P) again ([39, Theorem 1.16]). Therefore one may also equivalently de-
ﬁne that A is P-Fredholm if A + K(X,P) is invertible in the quotient algebra
L(X,P)/K(X,P). Of course, the usual Fredholm property has to dovetail with
this modiﬁed setting:

• A ∈ L(X,P) is Fredholm iﬀ there exist projections P, P (cid:48)
∈ K(X,P) of ﬁnite
rank such that im P = ker A and ker P (cid:48) = im A. In that case A is P-Fredholm.

8

• A ∈ L(X,P) is not Fredholm iﬀ for every  > 0 and every l ∈ N there exists a
projection Q ∈ K(X,P) with rank Q ≥ l such that (cid:107)AQ(cid:107) <  or (cid:107)QA(cid:107) < .
If the above holds then P is said to equip X with the P-dichotomy, and actually
this is shown to be true in the cases one is usually interested in, such as X being a
Hilbert space, X = Lp(RN ) or X = lp(ZN ) with p ∈ [1,∞], etc. (see [39, Sections
1.2, 3.3.1 and Proposition 1.27]).

We say that a sequence (An) ⊂ L(X,P) converges P-strongly to A ∈ L(X) if

(cid:107)K(An − A)(cid:107) + (cid:107)(An − A)K(cid:107) → 0 as n → ∞

holds for every K ∈ K(X,P). In that case (An) is automatically bounded, its P-
strong limit A = P-lim An is automatically contained in L(X,P) and

(cid:107)A(cid:107) ≤ lim inf (cid:107)An(cid:107).

(4)
These P-substitutes for the classical triple (compactness, Fredholmness, strong
convergence) provide us with a “universe” which mimics the classical world in large
parts. The advantage is that this new framework has a simple consistent and sym-
metric algebraic structure, it is more ﬂexible and it is better adapted to the setting
X with the sequence of the projections Pn.

In the next section, we return to our concrete setting X = Lp(R) with the se-
quence of the (non-compact) canonical projections Pn. Notice that this approach
already served as a key instrument in [23] for the treatment of the ﬁnite sections of
arbitrary convolution and convolution type operators operators on the spaces L1(R)
and L∞(R), where the situation with the classical approach is even worse: the Pn do
not converge ∗-strongly there.
2.5. Classes of convolution operators in L(X,P)
Consider X = Lp(R), 1 < p < ∞, with P = (Pn) = (χ[−n,n]I) the sequence of the
canonical projections and abbreviate the complementary projections by Qn := I−Pn.
Notice that K(X) ⊂ K(X,P) ⊂ L(X,P) ⊂ L(X) and all inclusions are proper
(see e.g. [22]).
Deﬁnition 5. An operator A ∈ L(X) is called band operator with band-width w if

Q1+wVsAV−sP1 = P1VsAV−sQ1+w = 0 for every s ∈ R.

The elements in the smallest closed algebra which contains all band operators are
called band-dominated operators. Moreover, A ∈ L(X) is said to be quasi-banded if
(5)

n>0 (cid:107)Qn+mAPn(cid:107) = lim

m→∞ sup

n>0 (cid:107)PnAQn+m(cid:107) = 0.

m→∞ sup
lim

9

Almost obviously, band operators are band-dominated, and band-dominated ones
are quasi-banded. Moreover, one can show [23, 27, 22] that both, the set of band-
dominated operators and the set of quasi-banded operators are closed and inverse
closed subalgebras of L(X,P) which contain K(X,P) as a closed ideal. If A from
one of these algebras is P-Fredholm, then its P-regularizers are in the same algebra
again.

Remark 6. Roughly speaking these deﬁnitions determine to what extend the opera-
tors are able to transport information along the axis. The deﬁnition of band operators
is primarily motivated by the analogous lp-setting, where one has a natural inter-
pretation of bounded linear operators as inﬁnite matrices. Then the deﬁnition just
means that band operators have only a ﬁnite number of non-zero diagonals.

Besides, there are equivalent characterizations which appear to be very natural
also in the Lp-setting. For this, deﬁne the commutator [A, B] := AB − BA of two
operators A, B, and moreover, for every function ϕ over R and t > 0 introduce the
inﬂated copy ϕt by ϕt(x) = ϕ(x/t).
Proposition 7. ([27, Theorem 2.1.6] and [22, Theorem 1.42]) A ∈ L(X) is band-
dominated if and only if

(cid:107)[A, ϕtI](cid:107) → 0 as

t → ∞ for every function ϕ ∈ BUC .

Surprisingly this is also equivalent to

(cid:107)[A, ϕtI](cid:107) → 0 as

t → ∞ for the particular functions ϕ(x) := e±ix.

For convolutions (i.e. shift-invariant operators, by Hörmanders result) this means

Corollary 8. W 0(b) is band-dominated if and only if

(cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107) → 0 as

(6)
In this case b ∈ BUC. On the other hand, if b ∈ BUCp then W 0(b) is band-dominated.
Proof. The ﬁrst part is Proposition 7. For the second, we start with the case p = 2.
Then, with ϕ(x) := e±ix,

t → ∞ for every function ϕ ∈ BUC .

(cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107) = (cid:107)[F −1bF, ϕtI](cid:107) = (cid:107)F −1[bI, F ϕtF −1]F(cid:107)

= (cid:107)[bI, W 0(ϕ−t)](cid:107) = (cid:107)[bI, V±1/t](cid:107),

10

which tends to 0 as t → ∞ iﬀ b ∈ BUC. On the other hand, again by Proposition 7,
this tends to zero iﬀ W 0(b) is band-dominated.
If W 0(b) is band-dominated on Lp(R), p (cid:54)= 2, then it is also band-dominated on
L2(R), hence b ∈ BUC.
Finally, let b ∈ BUCp. Since the algebra of band-dominated operators is closed we
can restrict our considerations to a dense subset and assume that b ∈ M r for an r with
|r − 2| > |p − 2|, by the deﬁnition of BUCp. Then, for every ϕ ∈ BUC, (cid:107)ϕ(cid:107)∞ = 1, it
holds that (cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107)L(Lr(R)) ≤ 2(cid:107)W 0(b)(cid:107)L(Lr(R)) for all t > 0. On the other hand
(cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107)L(L2(R)) → 0 as t → ∞. By the Riesz-Thorin Interpolation Theorem
then also (cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107)L(Lp(R)) → 0 as t → ∞, thus W 0(b) is band-dominated by
Equation (6).

For quasi-banded convolutions we have a characterization similar to (6) as well.

Theorem 9. A convolution W 0(b) ∈ L(X) is quasi-banded if and only if
(cid:107)[W 0(b), ϕtI](cid:107) → 0 as t → ∞ for every function ϕ ∈ C(R).

(7)

Proof. Deﬁne χ− := χ(−∞,0] and χ+ := χ[0,∞) and recall from [23, Proposition 13]
that a shift-invariant operator A = W 0(b) ∈ L(X) is quasi-banded if and only if
χ±Aχ∓I are P-compact. Let (7) be true. The desired P-compactness easily follows
if (cid:107)χ±AV∓nχ∓V±n(cid:107) → 0 as n → ∞, since A is shift invariant. But this is obvious
taking (7) for the continuous piecewise linear splines ϕ(x) = 0 (x ≤ 0), ϕ(x) = 1
(x ≥ 1) resp. 1 − ϕ into account, e.g.

(cid:107)χ−AVnχ+V−n(cid:107) = (cid:107)χ−AϕnVnχ+V−n(cid:107) ≈ (cid:107)χ−ϕnAVnχ+V−n(cid:107) = 0.

Conversely, let A = W 0(b) be quasi-banded, ϕ ∈ C(R), (cid:107)ϕ(cid:107)∞ = 1, and  > 0.
Since A− χ−Aχ−I − χ+Aχ+I is P-compact for which (7) obviously holds, it suﬃces
to consider B = χ+Aχ+I. Firstly choose m ∈ N such that |ϕ(x)−ϕ(+∞)| <  for all
x ≥ m. Moreover, there is an r such that on each of the intervals [(k− 1)m/r, km/r],
k = 1, . . . , r, it holds that |ϕ(x) − ϕ(km/r)| < , respectively. W.l.o.g. we can
assume that m/r = 1, otherwise replace ϕ by ϕr/m. Also, there exists a t0 such that
(cid:107)ϕt − ϕ(cid:98)t(cid:99)(cid:107)∞ <  for every t ≥ t0, where (cid:98)t(cid:99) denotes the largest integer ≤ t. Since B
is quasi-banded we can ﬁnd a t1 ∈ N, t1 ≥ t0 such that, with Qn := I − Pn,

With a similar estimate for B = χ−Aχ−I this yields (7) and ﬁnishes the proof since
 > 0 was chosen arbitrarily.

In [23] it has already been proved that quasi-banded operators, hence most of the
operators we are interested in, belong to L(X,P). In particular, convolutions with
multipliers in SOp, APp and C(R)p are quasi-banded as is shown there. Here is the
remaining ingredient for the present paper:
Lemma 10. The Cauchy singular integral operator S belongs to L(X,P), but is not
quasi-banded.
Proof. Let u ∈ X = Lp(R) and n > m. Using the modulus inequality, Hölder’s
inequality and (q − 1) p
(cid:107)PmS(I − Pn)u(cid:107)p ≤ (cid:107)PmSχ[n,+∞)u(cid:107)p + (cid:107)PmSχ(−∞,−n]u(cid:107)p

we obtain the dual formula:
Finally, S is not quasi-banded by [23, Proposition 26].
Corollary 11. If b ∈ [PC, SO, BUC]p then W 0(b) ∈ L(X,P). Moreover, if b ∈
[SO, BUC]p then W 0(b) is quasi-banded.

Proof. In the case p = 2 we have already tackled all generators of [PC, SO, BUC] in
the previous considerations.

If p (cid:54)= 2 then we again use an interpolation argument as in the proof of Corollary
8 and combine it with [27, Proposition 1.1.8] which states that an operator A belongs
to L(X,P) if and only if

(cid:107)PmAQn(cid:107) + (cid:107)QnAPm(cid:107) → 0 as n → ∞ for every m ∈ N.

Let b ∈ [PC, SO, BUC] ∩ M <p> and r with |r − 2| > |p − 2| such that b ∈ M r. Then
(cid:107)PmW 0(b)Qn(cid:107)+(cid:107)QnW 0(b)Pm(cid:107) ≤ 2(cid:107)W 0(b)(cid:107) over Lr(R). Since W 0(b) ∈ L(L2(R),P)
by the above, we have (cid:107)PmW 0(b)Qn(cid:107)+(cid:107)QnW 0(b)Pm(cid:107) → 0 over L2(R). By the Riesz-
Thorin Interpolation Theorem we get convergence to zero also over Lp(R).
Finally, if b ∈ [SO, BUC] ∩ M <p> then we use the same interpolation argument

to estimate the norms in (5).

Summary We get the following picture for convolutions on X = Lp(R):

All convolution operators with multipliers in the algebra [PC, SO, BUC]p belong to
L(X,P), but some of them are not in the class of quasi-banded operators, in partic-
ular those with Fourier multipliers with jumps at ﬁnite points. In contrast, jumps at
inﬁnity are permitted and all functions in the algebra [SO, BUC]p yield quasi-banded
operators. Further, for all functions b ∈ [SO∞, AP, BUC]p = [BUC]p the operators
W 0(b) are even banded-dominated. We point out that slowly oscillating multipliers
with discontinuities at ﬁnite points do not generate band-dominated convolutions,
but only quasi-banded operators.

3. Setting up the algebraic framework

The basic idea for the study of stability (and more general properties) of the ﬁnite
sections sequences is to embed these sequences A = {An} into a Banach algebra
framework. In this framework, there is a family of homomorphisms which condense
A to single operators which we call snapshots.
Intuitively speaking we pursue a
divide and conquer strategy: each one of these snapshots captures a certain easy

14

part of the relevant properties of A, and all of them together are suﬃcient for the
complete characterization of A.

We start with deﬁning this algebra framework on an abstract level and state all
relevant prerequisites as well as the main results. In Section 3.2 we apply this tool to
our problem and show that it covers the classes of convolution type operators that we
announced in the introduction. At this stage, the general main theorem still contains
a somewhat abstract and unhandy condition which is removed in Section 3.3 by
localization. This then yields the main results of this paper, in particular Theorem
1. Finally, in Section 3.4 we propose a slightly modiﬁed implementation of the
framework which makes the snapshots a little more involved, but then additionally
includes the ﬂip operator, hence Hankel operators, as well.

3.1. Algebras of structured and rich sequences

Here we mainly follow [23, 38, 39]. Let X be a Banach space. We are interested
in the study of bounded sequences A = {An}n∈N of bounded operators An ∈ L(X).
By F we denote the set (actually the Banach algebra, equipped with the usual entry-
wise deﬁned linear structure and the norm (cid:107)A(cid:107) := supn (cid:107)An(cid:107)) of all such bounded
sequences.
As announced, we further introduce a family (w.r.t. an index set T ) of snapshots
Wt(A), t ∈ T , which are bounded linear operators on certain Banach spaces X t,
respectively. This is done as follows: Suppose that for each t ∈ T there is a sequence
n : L(X t) → L(X), n ∈ N. Then the sequence
of Banach algebra isomorphisms Et
n)−1(An)} is a transformed copy of A of operators now acting on X t.
{A(t)
Then, let F T denote the set of all sequences A ∈ F with the property that for every
t ∈ T there exists an operator in L(X t), which we denote by Wt(A), such that

n } := {(Et

A(t)

n = (Et

n)−1(An) → Wt(A) as n → ∞.

This convergence is to be understood as as one of the three following cases:

n → Wt(A) and

→ (Wt(A))∗ strongly,

• Either all these limits are ∗-strong limits, which means that A(t)
n )∗
(A(t)
• or on every space X t there exists a uniform approximate identity P t which
equips X t with the P t-dichotomy, and the limits are P t-strong limits, respec-
tively. In that case Wt(A) has to belong to L(X t,P t),
• or there is a partition of T = T∗ ∪ TP, and the limits for t ∈ T∗ are supposed to
be ∗-strong limits, whereas for all t ∈ TP they are P t-strong limits as above,
respectively.

15

Figure 1: Taking snapshots: transformation and passing to limits

We say that the sequences in F T are T -structured, since they have a certain asymp-
totic structure which is reﬂected in their snapshots.

Compact and Fredholm sequences Besides invertibility and stability, we
also want to address a Fredholm property (kind of “almost stability”), thus we have
to introduce compact-like sequences as follows:

For t ∈ T let Kt be the set of all compact or P t-compact operators, depending
on the type of the convergence (i.e. depending on whether t ∈ T∗ or t ∈ TP). Then,
n(K)},
let J T be the smallest closed subspace of F which contains all sequences {Et
K ∈ Kt, t ∈ T , and all sequences {Gn}, (cid:107)Gn(cid:107) → 0 as n → ∞.
In order to make things ﬁt together one has to impose two natural conditions:
(I) For all t ∈ T it holds that sup{(cid:107)Et
(II) For all τ, t ∈ T and every K t ∈ Kt it holds that
n(K t)} =(cid:40)K t

n)−1(cid:107) : n ∈ N} < ∞.

if t (cid:54)= τ

0

The ﬁrst condition guarantees that the transformations are not too exotic, and the
second one is usually referred to as the separability condition and means that the
directions from which one can look at a sequence are separated in the sense that the
(P t-)compact operators K t and their liftings {Et
n(K t)} which arise from one point
of view t ∈ T are invisible from every other direction τ.

two-sided ideal. The mappings Wt : F T → L(X t), t ∈ T , which send each A to
Wt(A), respectively, are Banach algebra homomorphisms.
A sequence A ∈ F T is said to be J T -Fredholm if A + J T is invertible in the
quotient algebra F T /J T . So this is “invertibility modulo J T -compact sequences”.
Actually, if A is J T -Fredholm then all its snapshots are Fredholm, resp. P-Fredholm.
If all snapshots are Fredholm then A is said to be regular.
The collection of the main results for T -structured sequences reads as follows:

Theorem 12. Let A = {An} ∈ F T .

1. If A is a regular J T -Fredholm sequence then, for suﬃciently large n, the oper-
ators An are Fredholm and all snapshots Wt(A) are Fredholm. Moreover, their
approximation numbers from the right have the α(A)-splitting property, that is

n→∞ sr

α(A)(An) = 0

and

n→∞ sr
lim inf

α(A)+1(An) > 0,

with

α(A) =(cid:88)t∈T

ind Wt(A).

Analogously, the approximation numbers from the left have the β(A)-splitting

n→∞ ind An =(cid:88)t∈T

property, where β(A) =(cid:80)t∈T dim coker Wt(A) is ﬁnite. Furthermore,
2. If one snapshot is not Fredholm then, for all k ∈ N, min{sr
k(An)} → 0
3. A is stable if and only if A is J T -Fredholm and all snapshots are invertible.
So, roughly speaking, in the Fredholm case, the Fredholm properties of An are
captured by the snapshots, in particular the stability is connected with the invert-
ibility of all Wt(A). Otherwise, if one snapshot is not Fredholm then also the An
cannot be close to Fredholmness.

k(An), sl

Of course, we have to recall the deﬁnitions of the approximation numbers which

are used here to gather the Fredholm properties of the An from [39]
sr
k(A) := inf{(cid:107)A − T(cid:107) : T ∈ L(X), dim ker T ≥ k},
sl
k(A) := inf{(cid:107)A − T(cid:107) : T ∈ L(X), dim coker T ≥ k}.

3Clearly, {I} is its unit.

17

In a sense, these numbers measure the degree of (or distance to) injectivity and sur-
jectivity, respectively. Also notice that in case of X being a Hilbert space, these
approximation numbers coincide with the lower singular values of A or A∗, respec-
tively.

Rich sequences Actually, for our purposes in Section 3.2 this framework of T -
structured sequences is still too restrictive, and what we need is a tool for sequences
A which may not be T -structured (as a full sequence), but which have at least
suﬃciently many subsequences Ag = {Agn} (where g : N → N is strictly increasing)
being T -structured.
To be more precise, we ﬁrstly point out, that one can of course ﬁx such a strictly
increasing sequence g = (gn) and consider the above machinery for subsequences
In an analogous way to F and F T
Ag = {Agn} instead.
g we deﬁne Fg as the set
g as the set of all Ag ∈ Fg for which all limits
of all bounded sequences Ag and F T
gn)−1(Agn) exist. Clearly, the analogous conditions (I) and
Wt(Ag) := limn→∞(Et
(II) hold. Deﬁne, further, the set J T
g of “compact subsequences” and the notion
g -Fredholmness. Of course, Theorem 12 can be translated to this subsequence
of J T
framework.

Here is now the next step: A sequence A ∈ F is rich if every subsequence of A
g . Denote the set of all
has a T -structured subsequence Ag = {Agn}, i.e. Ag ∈ F T
rich sequences by RT . Furthermore, for A ∈ RT we denote by HA the set of all
g . Also, all snapshots of T -structured
strictly increasing g : N → N for which Ag ∈ F T
subsequences of A are referred to as snapshots of A.
Theorem 13. It holds that

1. F ⊃ RT ⊃ F T are Banach algebras and RT is inverse closed in F.
2. If for A = {An} ∈ RT every T -structured subsequence has a regularly J T -

Fredholm subsequence then A has ﬁnite α- and β-number α(A), β(A), i.e.

n→∞ sr

n→∞ sr

and β-number, i.e. for every k ∈ N

4. For A ∈ RT the following are equivalent

(d) Every T -structured subsequence of A is J T -Fredholm and all snapshots of

all snapshots of A are invertible.

A are invertible.

Some comments about the proofs A thorough exposition of this model with
full proofs and applications can be found in [38, Section 2], even in a slightly more
general form. However, the results on T -structured sequences are also introduced
and proved in [39, Section 2]. Theorem 13 (except 3.) can be proved as was done in
[23, Theorem 8]. Its 3rd assertion immediately follows from [39, Theorem 2.26 and
Corollary 2.27].

3.2. The sequence algebra framework for convolution type operators

Now we come back to our initial problem, the ﬁnite section method for convolution
type operators on X := Lp(R), and we apply the general theory of the previous
section to this concrete situation. This actually means that we are aiming for a
framework which includes the algebra 4

A := alg(cid:8){aI}, {W 0(b)}, {K}, {Pn} :

a ∈ [PC, SO, L∞

0 ], b ∈ [PC, SO, BUC]p, K ∈ K(X,P)} .

(9)

For this we set T := TP ∪ T∗ with TP := {−, c, +} and T∗ := R, and further
X t := Lp(R) for every t ∈ T , where P t := P = (Pn) = (χ[−n,n]I) if t ∈ TP. Then,
F T is the set of all A = {An} ∈ F for which the P-strong limits

Wc(A) := P-lim

n→∞ An, W−(A) := P-lim

n→∞ VnAnV−n, W+(A) := P-lim

n→∞ V−nAnVn

4Recall that AP ⊂ BUC.

19

and, for every t ∈ T∗, the ∗-strong limits
Ht(A) := s-lim
exist, where we recall the homomorphisms

n→∞ Z−1

n UtAnU−tZn

Zn : (Znu)(x) = n−1/pu(x/n), Ut : (Utu)(x) = eitxu(x) on Lp(R)

from [18]. Clearly, we have to ensure that
Lemma 14. The Conditions (I) and (II) are satisﬁed.
Proof. Since all Vn, Zn and Ut are isometric isomorphisms, the ﬁrst condition is
obvious. For the second one we start with K := Pm = χ[−m,m]I, and recall from
n(K)} = {K} the W±-snapshots are zero. Further, all
[23] that for the sequence {Ec
Ht-snapshots are zero by [18, Lemma 7.4.(b)]. For {K} with arbitrary K ∈ K(X,P)
just use the observation K = PmKPm + K(I − Pm) + (I − Pm)KPm. Then, given
any prescribed  > 0, choose and ﬁx m suﬃciently large such that the second and
third summand get less than  and observe the desired convergence for the ﬁrst
summand. So, W±({K}) = 0 and Ht({K}) = 0, t ∈ R, easily follow. Liftings
{E±
n Ut} with K a compact operator.
The limits Hs{Jn} = 0 for s (cid:54)= t were shown in [11, Proposition 4.3]. Next,

n (K)} = {V±nKV∓n} are treated similarly.
Now, for t ∈ R consider {Jn} = {U−tZnKZ−1
(cid:107)PmU−tZnKZ−1

n UtPmU−tZnK(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)Z−1

n Ut(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)U−tZnZ−1

as n → ∞, for every m, as discussed above. By duality, Wc{Jn} = 0 follows. The
snapshots W±

n UtPmU−tZnK(cid:107) → 0
{Jn} = 0 are proved analogously and the rest is straightforward.

Thus, we have the above Theorems 12 and 13 available, and the rest of this

section is devoted to the proof that this applies to all sequences in A:
Proposition 15. A ⊂ RT .
In fact, all we have to do is to check that the generators of A are rich. For
{K} it is already clear by Lemma 14, and the remaining cases are treated in the
subsequent lemmas, where we also compute their snapshots. Deﬁne χ− := χ(−∞,0]
and χ+ := χ[0,+∞).
Lemma 16. For every a ∈ L∞(R) it holds that Wc{aI} = aI.
For a ∈ L∞

{aI} = a(−∞)I, W+{aI} = a(+∞)I, Ht{aI} = (a(−∞)χ− + a(+∞)χ+)I.
For a ∈ SO∞ it holds that {aI} ∈ RT , where all snapshots Wt({aI}g), g ∈ H{aI},
t ∈ T \ {c}, are multiples of the identity.

0 ∪ PC∪(cid:83)λ∈R SOλ we have {aI} ∈ F T where, for all t ∈ R,

Proof. The W-snapshots for all functions under consideration are almost obvious or
have already been discussed in [23].

Since a ∈ L∞
0 yields aI ∈ Kc = K(X,P), hence {aI} ∈ J T , we see that all
H-snapshots are zero by Lemma 14.
Functions a ∈ PC∪(cid:83)λ∈R SOλ can be decomposed a = a(−∞)χ− +a(+∞)χ+ +a0
with a0 ∈ L∞
Finally, let a ∈ SO∞ and g : N → N be strictly increasing. From [22, Prop.
3.39] or [23] it is already known that there is a subsequence h ⊂ g such that the
W-snapshots of {aI}h exist. It remains to show that for a certain subsequence l of
h one also has the existence of all Ht, t ∈ R. For this we consider

0 , and χ± are tackled in [18, Proposition 7.4.b].

aZhnu)(x) = a(hnx)u(x).

The set of all continuous functions u with compact support Uu such that 0 /∈ Uu is
dense in Lp(R), thus it suﬃces to consider such u. Fix one point x0 ∈ Uu. Then,
by a Bolzano-Weierstrass argument, there is a subsequence l of h such that a(lnx0)
converges, lets say to a0. Since a ∈ SO∞ the oscillation osc(a(ln·), Uu) tends to
zero, hence the sequence of the functions x (cid:55)→ a(lnx)u(x) converges uniformly to the
function a0u(x), which gives the claim.
Lemma 17. For every Fourier multiplier b it holds that

Wc{W 0(b)} = W−

{W 0(b)} = W+{W 0(b)} = W 0(b).

If b ∈ [BUC, PC]p then {W 0(b)} ∈ F T with

Ht{W 0(b)} = W 0(b(t − 0)χ− + b(t + 0)χ+)

(t ∈ R).

If b ∈ [BUC, PC, SO]p then {W 0(b)} ∈ RT and the Ht-snapshots (of T -structured
subsequences) are still of the form W 0(c−χ− + c+χ+) with constants c−, c+.
Proof. The W-snapshots are clear, since convolution operators are shift invariant.

For the H-snapshots we ﬁrst assume that p = 2. Then it suﬃces to consider the
generators W 0(b) separately with b either uniformly continuous over R, or b = χ[λ,∞),
or b ∈ SOλ for λ ∈ R. The piecewise continuous and the slowly oscillating b are
already studied in [18, Proposition 7.4.c]. so, let b ∈ BUC and  > 0. Then there
exists a δ > 0 such that sup{osc(b, [t−δ, t+δ]) : t ∈ R} < . Let ϕt be the continuous
piecewise linear spline which is 1 at the point t and 0 outside the interval [t− δ, t + δ],
resp. Then

W 0(b) = W 0(bϕt) + W 0(b(1− ϕt)) = b(t)W 0(ϕt) + W 0((b− b(t))ϕt) + W 0(b(1− ϕt)),

where the ﬁrst term has the Ht-snapshot b(t)I, the third one has Ht-snapshot zero,
and the second one has norm less then . Since  and t were arbitrarily chosen, we
ﬁnd that Ht(W 0(b)) must be b(t)I for every t ∈ R.
Now let p (cid:54)= 2 and ﬁx b ∈ [PC, SO, BUC]p and g : N → N. We can already
assume that b ∈ M r for an r with |2 − p| < |2 − r|. Indeed, this is clear since, by
the deﬁnition of the algebra [·]p, these particular functions are dense, and moreover
the H-homomorphisms are bounded (even uniformly w.r.t. t ∈ R). The sequence
{W 0(b)}g, considered as a sequence over L2(R) has a subsequence {W 0(b)}h ∈ F T
h .
We want to show that then all Ht{W 0(b)}h, t ∈ R, over Lp(R) exist as well. By
symmetry reasons it suﬃces to consider t = 0. Note that the snapshot H0{W 0(b)}h
over L2(R) is of the form W 0(b0) where b0 = c−χ− + c+χ+ with constants c−, c+.
Let d denote the continuous piecewise linear spline which is 1 over [−1, 1] and
0 for |x| ≥ 2. Then, as shown in [18, Proposition 7.4.c], Z−1

such an m. Then, for the 2nd summand notice that all the functions (bhn − b0)d3

n ∈ N, are continuous at 0, have their supports contained in the compact support
of d3

uniformly. If b has only ﬁnitely many points of discontinuity, then this is obvious
since, for suﬃciently large n, the points of discontinuity of bhn − b0 are outside

follows as in the proof of Lemma 16. For general b we just apply the density of the set
of all functions with ﬁnitely many discontinuities and an approximation argument.

Thus, (cid:107)W 0((bhn − b0)d3

3.3. Finite sections of convolution type operators

Theorem 13 gives us stability conditions and a characterization of the asymptotic
behavior of the approximation numbers for a wide class of operator sequences: the
T -rich sequences. To know if the conditions are satisﬁed, we need to know whether
or when for a given sequence A every T -structured subsequence has a subsequence
Ah which is regularly J T -Fredholm, that means a subsequence Ah such that Ah +J T
is invertible in the quotient algebra F T
h and all operators Wt(Ah) and Ht(Ah)
are Fredholm.

h /J T

We will show, in particular, for ﬁnite sections of operators in a large class of
convolution type operators, that the P-Fredholmness of the three snapshots Wt(Ah)
imply the invertibility in F T
In order to apply Allan-Douglas principle, we start by deﬁning, for each contin-
uous function ϕ ∈ C( ˙R), the sequence of expanded functions given by

h .

tation is given by

Deﬁne further, C := {{ϕnI} : ϕ ∈ C( ˙R)} and note that an alternative represen-
(10)

{ϕnI} = {ZnϕZ−1
n }.

Proposition 20. C is a closed commutative subalgebra of F T ⊂ RT with

{ϕnI} = ϕ(±1)I, Wc{ϕnI} = ϕ(0)I

and Ht{ϕnI} = ϕI for all t ∈ R;

W±

and is isometrically isomorphic to C( ˙R).

23

Proof. Note that W+{ϕnI} = P- limn→∞ φnI, with φn(x) := ϕ( x+n
n ). Since φn con-
verges pointwise to ϕ(1) and ϕ ∈ C( ˙R), then ϕnI converges P-strongly to ϕ(1)I.
The same arguments apply to the other W-snapshots. For the H-snapshots, the
assertion is straightforward taking into account (10). Thus, C is a closed commuta-
tive subalgebra of F T and it is also clear that the map {ϕn} (cid:55)→ ϕ is an isometric
isomorphism.

For sequences A and B, let [A, B] denote the commutator AB − BA.

Proposition 21. For every ϕ ∈ C( ˙R),
(a) (cid:107)[ϕnI, W 0(b)](cid:107) → 0 for b ∈ [SO, BUC]p
(b) [{ϕnI},{W 0(χ[t,∞))}] = {U−tZnKZ−1
Proof. Assertion (a) is a consequence of Corollary 11 and Theorem 9. For the
symbols b = χt = χ[t,∞), t ∈ R, from the relations W 0(χt) = U−tW 0(χ+)Ut and
Z−1
n W 0(χ+)Zn = W 0(χ+) for every t ∈ R, it follows that
ϕnW 0(χt) − W 0(χt)ϕnI = ϕnU−tW 0(χ+)Ut − U−tW 0(χ+)UtϕnI

and since [ϕI, W 0(χ+)] is a compact operator (see [32, Prop 5.3.1]) we obtain asser-
tion (b).

a ∈ [PC, SO, L∞

We now introduce a subalgebra A1 of A by
A1 := alg(cid:8){aI}, {W 0(b)}, {K}, {Pn} :
0 ], b ∈ [PCλ, SO, BUC]p, λ ∈ R, K ∈ K(X,P)(cid:9) (11)
and mention that it is not known if A1 is really a proper subalgebra of A, since it is
unknown whether there are multipliers in PCp which do not belong to the smallest
closed algebra which includes all [PCλ, SO, BUC]p, λ ∈ R. Anyway, this algebra
covers, unites and extends all previously considered cases in the literature.
Corollary 22. Let A ∈ A1. Then [A, C] ∈ J T for every C ∈ C.
Proof. It suﬃces to check the assertion for the generators of A1. Clearly, constant
sequences {aI} of operators of multiplication, as well as {Pn} commute with {ϕnI},
and {K} ∈ J T by deﬁnition. The generators {W 0(b)} are covered by the previous

24

proposition, since every b ∈ [PCλ, SO, BUC]p can be decomposed as b = αχλ + c with
α ∈ C and c ∈ [SO, BUC]p, hence

[{ϕnI},{W 0(b)}] = α{U−λZn[ϕI, W 0(χ+)]Z−1

n Uλ} + [{ϕnI},{W 0(c)}],
where the latter summand tends to 0 as n → ∞ and the ﬁrst one is in J T .

h )/J T

h containing J T

Let h be an increasing sequence of natural numbers, Ch := {Ch : C ∈ C} and let
h be the set of sequences of local type, i.e. the set of all sequences Ah ∈ F T
LT
h ⊂ F T
with AhCh − ChAh ∈ J T
h for all C ∈ C.
h is a
Then [18, Lemma 6.2] translates to the present setting and provides that LT

h is a closed

h := (Ch + J T

just assume that the homomorphism C( ˙R) → LT
h . But
is not injective. Then {ϕhnI} + J T
then the snapshot H0{ϕhnI} = ϕI is a compact operator, hence ϕ ≡ 0, which is a
J
contradiction. Consequently, the maximal ideal space of C
h is homeomorphic to ˙R.
Denote by Φs the canonical homomorphism from LT
h onto the local algebra at
h /J T
s ∈ ˙R. Then, using Allan’s local principle (see e.g. [32, Theorem 2.2.2]), a sequence
h ) is invertible for every s ∈ ˙R.
h -Fredholm if and only if Φs(Ah + J T
Ah ∈ LT
We want to identify these local cosets, and for this goal we consider a subalgebra of
A1 which still contains the ﬁnite sections we are interested in.
Deﬁnition 23. Let FA1 be the smallest closed subalgebra of RT which contains all
ﬁnite section sequences {PnAnPn + (I − Pn)}, with {An} ∈ A1. Clearly, FA1 ⊂ A1
and it is not hard to check that each of its elements A = {An} is of the form

h is J T

h as well.

25

Proof. Since A is rich we can always easily pass to T -structured subsequences Ah,
h . Moreover, it is easily seen that {Wc(Ah)}
and then Corollary 22 yields Ah ∈ LT
and {V±hnW±1(Ah)V∓hn} belong to F T
h as well.
Let |s| < 1 and choose a continuous function ϕ such that supp ϕ ⊂ [−1, 1] and
ϕ(s) = 1. Then Φs({ϕhnI} +J T
h ) = 0
which implies Φs({Phn} + J T

h ) and Φs({ϕhn(I − Phn)} +J T
h ). Thus,

h ) = Φs({I} +J T
h ) = Φs({I} + J T

Φs(Ah + J T

h ) = Φs({Wc(Ah)} + J T
h ).

Actually, this already holds for the full sequence A.
For the local algebra at s = 1, we will check the assertion even for all se-
quences in A1, and we start with the generators. It holds that Φ1({Phn} + J T
h ) =
h ) and clearly equality (b) also holds for all Ah = {W 0(b)}h with
Φ1({Vhnχ−V−hn}+J T
b a Fourier multiplier. Suppose that a ∈ [PC, SO, L∞
h . Then
W+(Ah) exists, and in particular, ah := limn→∞ a(hn) ∈ C exists. Deﬁning intervals
Jn := [n/2, 3n/2], one can choose a continuous function ϕ which is supported in J1
and ϕ(1) = (cid:107)ϕ(cid:107) = 1. Then, actually, it holds much more, namely osc(a, Jn) → 0 as
n → ∞, and hence (cid:107)(a − ah)ϕn(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)(a − ah)χJn(cid:107) → 0. Consequently,

0 ] and Ah = {aI}h ∈ F T

Φ1({aI}h + J T

h ) = Φ1({aϕnI}h + J T
h )
= Φ1({ahϕnI}h + J T
h ) + Φ1({(a − ah)ϕnI}h + J T
h )
= Φ1({ahI}h + J T

h ) + 0.

Thus, we have (b) for all generators of A1. An arbitrary sequence A ∈ A1 is always
the norm limit of a sequence (A(m)) consisting of ﬁnite linear combinations and
products of the generators. By a standard diagonal argument one can pass to a
h . Since (b) is true for all
sequence h ⊂ g such that Ah and all A(m)
approximations A(m)
FA1, apply Φs({Phn} + J T

Lastly, if |s| > 1 then we beneﬁt from the restriction to the ﬁnite section algebra

it must hold for Ah as well.

Now let B be a P-regularizer of Wc(Ah), i.e. {B}{Wc(Ah)} = {I} + {K} with
a P-compact K. One easily checks that this yields the invertibility of all snapshots
W±({Wc(Ah)}h) and Hs({Wc(Ah)}h), s ∈ R, and that their respective inverses are
the snapshots of {B}h. Thus {B}h ∈ F T

Proposition 25. Let A ∈ FA1 and all the snapshots Wt(Ag), t ∈ TP, g ∈ HA, be P-

Proof. Let Ag be T -structured. Proposition 24 yields a subsequence Ah. By the

h ) of Φ1(Ah +J T
regularizer B of W+(Ah) provides an inverse Φ1({VhnBV−hn} +J T
Analogously, the P-Fredholmness of W−(Ah) and Wc(Ah) imply the invertibility of
the local elements at s = −1 and |s| < 1, respectively. Finally, if |s| > 1 the P-
Fredholmness of W+(Ah), which is of the form χ−W+(Ah)χ−I + µA(1− χ−)I implies
that µA is non-zero and therefore the claim.

Let s = 1, then Φ1(Ah + J T

Summarizing the previous results together with Theorem 13 we obtain

Theorem 26. For A = {An} ∈ FA1 it holds that

• If all snapshots of A are Fredholm then A has ﬁnite α- and β-number given by

α(A) = max

β(A) = max

h∈HA(cid:34) (cid:88)t=−,c,+
h∈HA(cid:34) (cid:88)t=−,c,+

dim ker Wt(Ah) +(cid:88)t∈R
dim coker Wt(Ah) +(cid:88)t∈R

dim ker Ht(Ah)(cid:35) ,
dim coker Ht(Ah)(cid:35) .

• If one snapshot is not Fredholm then A cannot have both ﬁnite α− and β−
number.
• A is stable if and only if all snapshots are invertible.
This particularly yields our motivating Theorem 1.

3.4. The ﬂip and Hankel operators

In this very last step we are going to include the ﬂip operator

J : Lp(R) → Lp(R), (Jf )(x) = f (−x)

and by this get access also to Hankel operators which are, by deﬁnition, of the form
H(b) = χ+W 0(b)χ−J. More precisely, we want to consider the algebra

B := alg(cid:8){J}, {aI}, {W 0(b)}, {K}, {Pn} :

a ∈ [PC, SO, L∞

0 ], b ∈ [PCλ, SO, BUC]p, λ ∈ R, K ∈ K(X,P)(cid:9) .

27

(12)

Unfortunately, this is not possible directly by the above approach because {J} is not
T -rich as the W±- and the Ht-snapshots, t (cid:54)= 0, do not exist for any subsequence. The
point is that the local properties at the “directions” t = + and t = − (as well as at
diﬀerent t ∈ R) are separated in case of A-sequences, whereas {J} now connects the
directions + and − (resp. t and −t). Therefore we introduce an adapted symmetrized
framework which combines the snapshots W±, as well as the pairs Hs, H−s (s > 0) into
operator-matrix-valued snapshots W∗, Hs,∗, respectively. These mappings are again
algebra homomorphisms F S
h of
h (T -structured in
S-structured (sub)sequences, which particularly cover all Ah ∈ F T
the former sense) and {J}, hence all generators of B, with

The homomorphisms Wc and H0 remain as before. Then we get for the ﬁnite section
algebra FB that is generated by all {PnAnPn +(I−Pn)} with {An} ∈ B the following.
Theorem 27. For A = {An} ∈ FB it holds that

• If all snapshots of A are Fredholm then A has ﬁnite α- and β-number with

α(A) = max

h∈HA(cid:104) dim ker Wc(Ah) + dim ker H0(Ah)

+ dim ker W∗(Ah) +(cid:88)s>0

lim

n→∞ ind Ahn = ind Wc(Ah) + ind H0(Ah) + ind W∗(Ah) +(cid:88)s>0

ind Hs,∗(Ah).

• If one snapshot is not Fredholm then A cannot have both ﬁnite α−, β− number.
• A is stable if and only if all snapshots are invertible.
We only sketch the proof since it follows in large parts the same line as before.
The main technical ingredients here are special tricky transformations which help to
overcome the unpleasant “non-local” behavior of the ﬂip operator.

are isometrically isomorphic to C[0,∞). Furthermore [C, ˜A] ∈ J S for every C ∈ D
and every A ∈ FB, by application of Corollary 22 and the relation [J, ϕn] = 0. Then,
one still identiﬁes the local cosets of ˜Ah, with {Wc,∗( ˜Ah)} at the points s ∈ [0, 1) and
with a certain multiple of the identity at the points s > 1. At the point s = 1 the
new snapshot W+,∗( ˜Ah) does the job, and Allan-Douglas ﬁnishes the proof.

4. Conclusions

The approach of this paper provides not only the well known results on the
stability / applicability of the Finite Section Method for classes of convolution type
operators with piecewise continuous and slowly oscillating data [18, 31], but goes
far beyond: On the one hand it completes the picture by describing also non-stable
sequences in terms of the asymptotic behavior of their approximation numbers and

30

Fredholm indices. On the other hand it covers much larger classes of data, including
almost periodic, even BUC, multipliers b, as well as operators of multiplication with
almost arbitrary functions a having restrictions only on the behavior at inﬁnity.
Actually, our approach permits to build upon much simpler (and probably even more
general) deﬁnitions of the multiplier algebras. Finally, also the ﬂip hence Hankel
operators are included.

Moreover, the constructions and proofs have become much simpler. In the previ-
ous works the localization had to be done over more involved commutative subalge-
bras of sequences arising from slowly oscillating functions whose deﬁnition is technical
and the characterization of their maximal ideal spaces required hard proofs. This
is now replaced by the simple algebra C. The keys for this simpliﬁcation are the
application of the P-theory, the concept of rich sequences, and the valuable charac-
terizations of quasi-banded operators.
Another remarkable point is that the role of the snapshots changed dramatically.
While in the previous literature the W-directions served for the construction a suf-
ﬁciently large ideal J such that the respective quotient has a large center, and the
H-snapshots provided the desired representatives for the identiﬁcation of the local
cosets, we now turn the table. In the present paper only the W-snapshots are used in
the identiﬁcation of the local cosets, whereas the H-directions provide the appropriate
J T .
