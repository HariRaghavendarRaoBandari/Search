The shear viscosity tensor of the superﬂuid Fermi gas in p -wave state with weak interaction
is calculated at low temperatures, by using the Boltzmann equation approach. We consider the
transition probabilities for the binary, decay and coalescence processes. We show that only the
binary processes are dominated at low temperatures and the components of shear viscosity ηxy,
ηxx, ηyy are proportional to (1/T )2, and ηxz, ηyz and ηzz are proportional to (1/T )4 and (1/T )6,
respectively.

INTRODUCTION

It is possible to create molecular Bose -Einstein con-
densates from weakly bound molecules consisting of two
fermion atoms. The molecular condensates are formed
when the scattering length is positive, corresponding to
an eﬀective repulsion between atoms. If the interaction
is attractive, the atoms may pair up in a manner similar
to the way in which electrons or atoms of liquid helium
three form Cooper pairs in superconducting metals or
superﬂuid helium three, respectively.

The ultracold atoms fermion gases such as 6Li and 40K
undergo to the superﬂuid state [1–3]. Salomon,s group
has reported evidence of p -wave molecules by sweeping
a Fermi gas of 6Li through a p resonance [4].
It is
therefore conceivable that the p -wave angular momen-
tum fermion superﬂuids can be realized in the ultracold
fermion atoms, specially in 6Li. Ho and Diener [5] by us-
ing the generalized Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink potential
[6] near the scattering resonance have obtained an ana-
lytic solution of the gap equation. They showed that the
ground state of l = 1 superﬂuid is an orbital ferromagnet
with pairing wave function Y11.

However, the successful experimental realization of the
superﬂuid from the BCS -BEC in ultracold trapped Fermi
gases has an initial considerable contribution in the study
of the BCS -BEC crossover or the regions near it. An op-
tically trapped Fermi gas of 6Li or 40K is a rich system
in which the strength of interaction between atoms can
be controlled by applying a variable bias magnetic ﬁeld
tuned near a Feshbach resonance [7]. It is generally be-
lieved that a high temperature superﬂuid exists at uni-
tarity, with a transition temperature of the order of the
Fermi temperature, Tc = (0.29 ± 0.02) TF [8].

One of the most fascinating properties of ultracold
trapped Fermi gases in the BCS regime, is the shear vis-
cosity. The viscous relaxation rate can be extracted from
the attenuation of collective modes [9] or the frequency-
dependent shear viscosity of the unitary Fermi gas can be
measured experimentally using Bragg spectroscopy [10].

The shear and bulk viscosities of 6Li in the weak-
coupling limit, for temperatures near Tc and zero have
been calculated by Shahzamanian and Yavari for the s -
wave superﬂuid [11, 12]. They showed that the shear vis-
cosity decreases as (1 − T /Tc) with temperature, when
passing through the transition temperature, and goes
to a constant at very low temperatures. This constant
is inversely proportional to the square of the scattering
length. These results can be generalized to the triple su-
perﬂuid state which has been considered by Modawi and
Leggett [13]. They obtained a triple spin superﬂuid state
with a gap function independent of the momentum direc-
tion plus a normal excitations part. The shear viscosities
of superﬂuid part and normal part are constant and pro-
portional to 1/T 2 at low temperatures, respectively. If we
ignore the interaction between these two ﬂuids the dom-
inated viscosity hence, is that of the normal excitations.
The value of the second viscosity is temperature inde-
pendent and is proportional to the inverse of the square
of scattering length in the limit of low temperatures, and
in the near transition temperature behaves as inverse of
the gap parameter [12].

Bruun and Smith by taking into account the eﬀect of
the medium on the scattering matrix for a homogeneous
gas in the unitarity limit showed that the viscous and
thermal relaxation rates are increased by nearly an order
of magnitude compared to their values in the absence of
medium eﬀect due to the Cooper instability at Tc. The
viscosity of a homogeneous system in the normal and
superﬂuid gases of fermions is calculated analytically at
low and high temperature limits for the normal and s -
wave superﬂuid [9, 14].

The shear viscosity of the unitarity ultracold gases,
similar to the bosonic superﬂuid 4He (which has been
considered by Wilks [15]), has been calculated by Rupak
and Sch¨afer [8]. The latter used the Boltzmann equa-
tion approach and showed that only the binary 2 → 2
collisions in which the number of particles is conserved,
are dominated in the collision integrals at low tempera-
tures, whereas the contribution of the splitting processes

in which the number of particles is not conserved can be
neglected. The scattering amplitude in the binary colli-
sion process has been calculated by many body approach.
Finally they could obtain a limit on the shear viscosity
by variational method. The shear viscosity of bosonic
superﬂuid at low temperatures, scales as ξ5/T 5, where
the universal parameter ξ relates chemical potential and
the Fermi energy, µ = ξεF [8].

The Kubo formulas approach has been used to calcu-
late the shear and bulk viscosities of strongly interact-
ing ultracold Fermi, Bose gases by Taylor and Randeria
[10], Shahzamanian and Yavari [12]. The former derived
sum rules for the shear and bulk viscosity spectral func-
tions, η(w) and ζ(w), respectively, of any Bose or Fermi
system with arbitrary two -body interaction, and also at
unitarity, the bulk or second viscosity spectral function
vanishes at all frequencies and all temperatures. The
latter by taking into account the contributions of the in-
teractions between condensate and noncondensate atoms
and between noncondensate atoms could obtain the vis-
cous relaxation times and calculated the value of shear
viscosity of a trapped Bose -condensed atomic gas in dif-
ferent limits of temperatures. The shear and bulk viscos-
ity in a BCS-BEC crossover scheme have been computed
by Levin group [16]. They extended the BCS-Leggett
ground state to nonzero temperature and obtained two
contributions to the square of pairing gap, corresponding
to condensed and to non-condensed pairs. Their results
show that the shear viscosity goes to zero at T −→ 0.

In this paper, we consider the shear viscosity of p -wave
superﬂuid Fermi gas, in the state Y11 at low temperatures
by using a potential model that is a generalization of the
separable potential used by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink
[6]. Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink studied a gas of fermions
interacting via an attractive potential. They introduced
the separable potential for s -wave fermion gases. Ho
and Diener generalized it to the p -wave fermion super-
ﬂuid gases [5]. Here we consider only the shear viscosity
components of superﬂuid. As we mentioned, the shear
viscosity of Bosic part, has been calculated by Rupak
and Sch¨afer [8]. In this paper we suppose that these su-
perﬂuids are mixture independently.

By using the Boltzmann equation approach and con-
sidering eﬀective interaction between quasiparticles in
the superﬂuid state, we obtain the transition probabil-
ities of possible processes at low temperatures. Since in
a superﬂuid the quasiparticles number is not conserved,
then other processes can occur, such as decay processes
in which one quasiparticle decays into three and coales-
cence processes in which three quasiparticles coalesce to
produce one, whereas in a normal Fermi gas at low tem-
peratures, only the binary processes are dominated.

Transition probabilities are obtained according to a
generalization of the potential model used by Nozieres
and Schmitt-Rink. More clearly, this potential model is
independent of angles between the momenta of quasipar-
ticles. We calculate the shear viscosity components of
superﬂuid Fermi gas at low temperatures by Sykes and

Brooker procedure [17].

II. TRANSITION PROBABILITIES

The eﬀective interaction between quasiparticles in the
superﬂuid states, is obtained by performing Bogoliuobov
transformation on the normal interaction.

The potential energy in BCS Hamiltonian is [18]

V = X~p1,~p2,~p3,~p4

where ~q = ~p3 − ~p1 = ~p4 − ~p2. The Bogoliubov transfor-
mation, between the normal quasiparticle creation a†
~p,σ
and annihilation a~p,σ operators, and creation and anni-
hilation operators α†
~p,σ and α~p,σ in the superﬂuid may be
written as

a~p,σ = u~p α~p,σ + σ v~p α†

−~p,−σ.

(2)

For the superﬂuid in p -wave state, we have the following
properties between u~p and v~p [19]

u−~p = u~p

;

v−~p = −v~p.

(3)

By using Eqs. (2) and (3) in Eq. (1) and the anticommu-
tation relations for the quasiparticle creation and anni-
hilation operators, the potential energy is obtained [20]

V = X~p1,~p2,~p3,~p4

which contains the terms α†

coalescence three quasiparticles into one, convert two
quasiparticles into two, create four quasiparticles from
the condensate and scatter four quasiparticles into con-
densate, respectively. The last two processes are not al-
lowed, because in each process the total energy should be
conserved.

The transition probability, for example, the decay pro-

cess is given by

W13 = |h...; ~p3, σ; ~p4, σ′; −~p2, −σ′; ...|V |...; ~p1, σ; ...i|2,

(5)

when Eq. (4) is substituted in Eq. (5) only the term
α†
~p3,σα†
−~p2,σ′ α~p1,σ will be entered the calculations

~p4,−σ′α†

,thus the transition probability may be written as

W 13(~p1, ~p2, ~p3, ~p4; σ, σ′)

× [−σ′(V~p3−~p1 + V~p1−~p3 ) + σ′δσ,−σ′ (V−~p1−~p2 + V~p1+~p2)]

× [σ′δσ,σ′ (V~p4−~p1 + V~p1−~p4 )
− σ′δσ,−σ′ (V−~p1−~p2 + V~p1+~p2 )]|2.

(6)

In general, as is seen from Eq. (6) W13 is, a function
of all the momenta through potentials, spins and tem-
perature. The transition probabilities of other processes
such as, W31(σ, σ′) and W22(σ, σ′) are written in terms
of u and v, the results of these calculations are in the
Appendix.

The Bogoliubov coeﬃcients u~p and v~p can be written

as

~p = ε2

~p + ∆2

where E2
~p, ε~p is the normal state quasiparticle
energy measured with respect to the chemical potential
and ∆~p is the magnitude of the gap in direction ~p on
the Fermi surface [19]. ∆~p = ∆(T ) sin θp, where ∆(T )
is the maximum gap and θp is the angle between the
quasiparticle momentum and gap axis ˆl that is supposed
to be in the direction of z axis.

At low temperatures, because more quasiparticles are
gathered in the nodes of gap, thus we have sin θpi ≃ 0
and ∆p ≃ 0 and E~p ≃ ε~p. In this temperature region,
Bogoliubov coeﬃcients can be approximated as u~p ≃ 1
and v~p ≃ 0. By using these approximations, we ﬁnd the
transition probabilities as

W13(↑↓) ≃ 0 , W13(⇈) ≃ 0,
W31(⇈) ≃ 0 , W31(↑↓) ≃ 0,

W22(↑↓) =

(10)

above equations indicate that the transition probabili-
ties are functions of the potential. In this paper, as we
mentioned we are using the model of potential, that is a
generalization of the separable potential used by Nozieres
and Schmitt-Rink, and can be written as [5]

Vl(p, p′) = λlWl(p)Wl(p′)

(12)

Because quasiparticles are gathered near the Fermi sur-
face at low temperatures, therefore their wave numbers
are nearly Fermi wave number. Thus, one may write

V1(p1, p3) = V1(p2, p3) ≃ λ1

(13)

For estimating this potential, we should know the order
of magnitude of pF and p0 to each other. The kinetic
energy of superﬂuid is p2
0/2m − εF . From equating the
potential energy with the kinetic energy, one may obtain
p0 as following

p2
0 ≃ p2

F + p2
λ,

(14)

where, pλ = (mλ1/2)
assumption, the potential energy may be written as

2 . This results p0 > pF . With this

V1(p1, p3) ≃

(15)

with applying this value of potential, the transition prob-
abilities are as follows

W22(↑↓) = |V1(p1, p3)|2 ≃

λ2

16

,

(16)

W22(⇈) = |V1(p1, p3) − V1(p2, p3)|2 ≃ 0.

(17)

It is noted that only the binary processes are domi-
nated in the limit of low temperatures and the transition
probabilities of other processes have nearly zero value.
Here, we emphasize that only the spin up and spin down
quasiparticles in the binary processes are contributed to
the transition probabilities at low temperatures which is
happened in superﬂuid helium three with strong interac-
tion, too [20]. The binary processes are dominated also
in the BEC regime at low temperatures [8].

III. COLLISION INTEGRAL

The kinetic equation for the quasiparticle distribution

function of superﬂuid, νp,σ, can be written as [21]

∂νp,σ

∂νp,σ

∂Ep,σ

−

∂νp,σ
∂~p

∂Ep,σ

= I(νp,σ),

(18)

where, I(νp,σ) is the collision integral. Let us assume a
disturbance of the form

νσ(p, r) = ν0(p) + δνσ(p),

(19)

where,
in general both ν(p) and δνσ(p) are functions
of the variable r, and ν0(p) is the distribution function
of equilibrium superﬂuid state. We deﬁne the function
ψσ(p) by

δνσ(p) = −

1
T

ν0(p)(1 − ν0(p))ψσ(p),

(20)

where, ν0(p) = [exp(E0
p − ~p · ~u)/T + 1]−1 and u is the
slightly inhomogeneous velocity in the gas. Substituting
Eq. (19) in Eq.(18), keeping the terms which contribute
to the shear viscosity, and supposing ~u and ~∇ · ~u are zero
at the point considered, to ﬁrst order in δνσ(p) we have

By substituting Eq. (24) in Eq. (21) and considering
K(t, x) = K(−t, −x), we have [17]

Z dxK(t, x)[qsσ (t) − λ2sσ qsσ (x)] = Bσ,

(26)

Z dxK(t, x)[qaσ (t) − λ2sσ qaσ (x)] = O(T Bσ),

(27)

where qsσ (t) and qaσ (t) are symmetric and antisymmet-
ric parts of q(t), respectively, and σ is simply the spin
index. At low temperatures, Eq. (27) is negligible, and
Eq. (26) is dominated [17]. In Eq. (26), λ2sσ and Bσ are
introduced as

Now, by using Eq. (19) and keeping the terms to ﬁrst
order in ψσ(P ), the linearized collision terms in the Boltz-
mann equation can be written as

(22)

where, ϕ2 is the azimuthal angle of ~p2 relative to ~p1,
t ≡ E1/T , x ≡ E3/T , and y ≡ E4/T .
It is noted that only two quasiparticles processes take
part to the collision integral at low temperatures and only
W22(↑↓) is not negligible for the Nozieres and Schmitt-
Rink potential.

To solve the linearized Boltzmann equation, it is suit-

able to deﬁne q(T ) as

By expressing the bracket in Eq. (23) in terms of a series
(cosΘ)eimΦ
of spherical harmonics,
[17] and substituting Eq. (23) in the collision integral,
the integration on ϕ2 can be done conveniently.
By noting some symmetries with respect to variables in
the collision integral [17],and performing integration on
y, we get

(29)

where, W22 is the transition probability for binary pro-
cesses and is independent of angles. Generally, for σ =↑
and ↓, W22 stands for W22(↑↓) and W22(↓↑), respectively.
Because in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld, W22(↑↓) =
W22(↓↑), the function W22 is the same. Therefore W22
in Eqs. (28) and (29) is λ2

1/16 for both cases.

For obtaining λ2sσ and Bσ, we note that θ is small
for the neutral superﬂuid case and its maximum value
is θm = πT /∆(0) [22], where maximum gap, ∆(0), for
fermion gas is equal to 1.76Tc at low temperatures [23].

(35)

by calculating the expansion of series in digamma func-
tion and ignoring the small terms in those, we obtain
c(λ2s↑ ) = c(λ2s↓ ) ≃ 0.75. The value of c(λ2sσ ) has been
calculated in [20] for superﬂuid liquid 3He by Pﬁtzner
procedure [24] and is 0.77 which is near to our obtained
value 0.75. The temperature dependence of λ and B is
completely diﬀerent from the λ and B that have been
obtained by Shahzamanian and Afzali [20].

Now, we will proceed to calculate the shear viscosity
in the next section by using the calculated values of Bσ,
λ2sσ and c(λ2sσ ).

deﬁned by the relation

These viscosity components obtained in Eqs. (41)−(43).
The transition probability W22 is written as λ2

where λ1 is the strength of interaction.
pF is given
by 1.91 (N 1/6/¯a), where N is the number of quasiparti-
cles and ¯a is the harmonic oscillator characteristic length
which is written as ¯a = (1/m¯ω)1/2 [23], where, m and ¯ω
are atomic mass and angular frequency, respectively. If
we use the values of ¯ω from [23] and m from [25], we get
the harmonic oscillator lengths for 6Li and 40K, equal to
0.30 × 10−5, 0.13 × 10−5, respectively. Then if we take
N = 106 [23], hence the values of pF for 6Li and 40K
are 6.72 × 10−28 and 15.50 × 10−28, respectively (these
calculations are in SI units).

Now we write the shear viscosity components in Eqs.
(41)−(43) in terms of the shear viscosity at Tc, η(Tc). At
the neutral Fermi gas, η(Tc) may be written as [26]

η(Tc) =

where in the normal state, W22 = W22(↑↓) + 1

operators, the potential energy may be written as

By using the interaction term in BCS Hamiltonian, we
calculate the transition probabilities for the binary, decay
and coalescence processes. Then we obtain, the transi-
tion probabilities in terms of the generalization of the
separable potential used by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink
[6]. Then we calculate the components of the shear vis-
cosity tensor of Fermi superﬂuid in p -wave state. The
shear viscosity tensor for a system with uniaxial symme-
try, which is under our consideration, can be written in
terms of the components of the symmetry axis, ˆl, with
ﬁve coeﬃcients [28]. It is shown that only three of the
coeﬃcients are independent.

Roobol et al.,s results on the shear viscosity of the
A1-phase of superﬂuid 3He in which only a single spin
population is paired, indicate η ∝ (T )−2 at low temper-
atures [27]. They illustrate that in measuring the values
of the viscosity, η, the values of the component ηzz have
more contribution than the values of the component ηxz.
Shahzamanian and Afzali [20] by using the procedures of
Pﬁtzner, and Sykes and Brooker could show these tem-
perature dependencies in superﬂuid 3He-A1. As it is
obvious the A1-phase of superﬂuid 3He contains the su-
perﬂuid with spin up Cooper pairs and the normal ﬂuid
with spin down. The interaction between these ﬂuids
plays the important role in temperature dependence of
the shear viscosity components. In this paper, we obtain
ηxy, ηxz and ηzz with temperature dependences as 1/T 2,
1/T 4 and 1/T 6, respectively (see Eqs. (41−43)). Ther-
mal relaxation rates may be determined directly exper-
imentally, and viscous relaxation rates can be extracted
from the attenuation of collective modes [9]. Our re-
sults on the viscosity components indicate that all col-
lective modes in ultracold fermion gases in p -wave state
are strongly damped.

The experimental measurements of the attenuation of
collective modes in ultracold fermion gases can determine
whether the superﬂuid state is s -wave or p -wave, since in
s -wave state the shear viscosity is constant at low tem-
peratures [9, 11], whereas in p -wave state all components
are proportional inversely to temperature with powers of
2, 4 and 6.

The viscosity of Bosonic part can be compared with
those of Fermionic parts. The component ηzz is pro-
portional to T −6 and will be dominated in the ultracold
gases at low temperatures. The experimental results in
this case are a clue to determine the state of the system.

using Eqs.(2) and (3) in Eq.(1) and the anticommutation
relations for the quasiparticle creation and annihilation

may be written as u~p ≃ 1 and v~p ≃ 0. By using these ap-
proximations, transition probabilities can be calculated
