We theoretically investigate the application of the fringe-locking method (FLM) in the dual-species quantum
test of the weak equivalence principle (WEP). With the FLM, the measurement is performed invariably at the
midfringe, and the extraction of the phase shift for atom interferometers is linearized. For the simultaneous
interferometers, this linearization enables a good common-mode rejection of vibration noise, which is usually
the main limit for high precision WEP tests of dual-species kind. We note that this method also allows for an
unbiased determination of the gravity accelerations diﬀerence, which meanwhile is readily to be implemented.

Introduction

1.
Beneﬁt from the highly developed atom interferometry
technology, cold atoms, possing both internal and ex-
ternal degrees of freedom, become ideal probes in many
precision measurements. They have been successfully
used in measuring gravity acceleration [1–10], gravity
gradient [7, 8, 11–16], rotation [17–23], magnetic ﬁeld
gradient [24–27], etc. Atom interferometers also play an
important role in fundamental physics, such as the mea-
surement of ﬁne structure constant, the determination
of gravitational constant G [28–30], and the test of the
weak equivalence principle (WEP) [2, 31–36].

WEP, as one of the cornerstones of Einstein’s general
relativity, states that all masses fall in the same way in a
gravitational ﬁeld regardless of their internal structure
and composition. Veriﬁcations of WEP using macro-
scopic masses have achieved a level of 10−13 [37, 38],
while the best level for testing WEP on quantum basis
is at the level of 10−9 [2]. Testing WEP using micro-
scopic particles still stimulated wide interest since the
neutron interferometer [39]. The reason is that, quan-
tum objects oﬀer more possibilities to break WEP and
meanwhile they also aﬀord potentially higher precision
and well deﬁned properties [34, 40, 41]. Up to date,
WEP tests on quantum basis have been performed using
atoms versus macroscopic bodies [2] or other atom specie
[34], using single-specie atoms in diﬀerent hyperﬁne lev-
els [31] or in diﬀerent spin orientations [42], and using
bosonic atoms versus fermionic atoms [35], achieving a
level of 10−7. In these tests, the corresponding gravity
accelerations are usually independently measured and
then compared, in which situation the vibration noise

cannot be common-mode rejected. Under this circum-
stance, WEP test using simultaneous dual-species atom
interferometers is particular interesting for its intrinsic
capability of common-mode suppressing the vibration
noise [32, 36]. WEP tests of this kind have already been
performed by several groups, achieving a level of 10−8
[36], and tests with higher precision are under develop-
ment [43, 44] or have been proposed [45, 46].

However, common-mode rejection of vibration noise
in WEP tests of dual-species kind, especially using non-
isotope species, is not so direct as that, for example, in
atom gradiometers. In the operation of coupled inter-
ferometers using the same atoms, it is mature to extract
the diﬀerential phase shift ∆Φ in a common-mode noises
immune way by the ellipse ﬁt method [47] or Bayesian
estimation [48–50]. But in WEP tests of dual-species
kind, the scale factors Sj ∼= keﬀ
j are usually diﬀerent
for the two interferometers, which originates from the
diﬀerent eﬀective Raman wave vectors used for the atom
species j = 1 and 2 when the pulses separation times
Tj are the same. The diﬀerent scale factors cause two
aspects of complexity in the signal extraction of WEP
tests. Firstly, the interested signal ∆g ≡ g1 − g2 is not
proportional to the diﬀerential phase shift, which ex-
cludes the direct extraction of ∆g using usual ellipse ﬁt
method or Bayesian estimation. Secondly, the induced
phase ﬂuctuations by vibration noise are not the same
for the two interferometers, which increases the diﬃculty
to common-mode suppress the vibration noise. The scale
factors can be made the same by using diﬀerent values
for the pulses separation times Tj, which is particularly
favorable in the case of the ratio r ≡ keﬀ
close to
unity [49]. However, in this situation, the experienced
vibration noise is not exactly the same for the two inter-
ferometers, which thus excludes the possibility of per-
fect common-mode suppression. It is also proposed to

2 /keﬀ

simultaneously measure the vibration noise by an aux-
iliary sensor and then reconstruct the fringes [51, 52].
The eﬀectiveness of this method depends on the quality
of the correlation between real and measured vibrations,
which is hard to ensure when the aimed precision of the
WEP test is beyond the intrinsic noise of state-of-art vi-
brations sensors. This problem may also be mathemat-
ically resolved by improved ellipse ﬁt method, Bayesian
estimation or direct phase extraction [33, 50, 52]. How-
ever, these solutions either require complex computation
(sometimes even causing a bias result) or suﬀer from the
trouble of separating the WEP violation signal from to-
tal diﬀerential phase shift.

It is already clear that the gravity acceleration or the
vibration induced phase shift is linear to keﬀ
j , and we
further note it is the conventional non-linear phase ex-
traction process from the interference fringe that com-
plicates the WEP violation signal separation and the
vibration noise common-mode rejection. Actually, the
fringe-locking method (FLM) has already been adopted
formerly for single atom interferometers [53–56] and re-
cently for coupled interferometers [16], by which the sig-
nal extraction of the interferometer can be linearized as
already exploited in single atom interferometer. In this
work, we propose to operate the dual-species atom in-
terferometers in the fringe-locking mode to linearize the
signal extraction, which promises a good common-mode
rejection of vibration noise, especially in the case of low
level vibration noise. We note that, in the WEP test
of dual-species kind, it only needs a change in the con-
trol of the Raman lasers eﬀective frequencies to perform
the fringe-locking method, and the corresponding signal
extraction is quite direct. Moreover, this fringe-locking
method allows for an unbiased determination of ∆g.

2. Review of Fringe-Locking Method
In light pulses atom interferometers, the interference
pattern is usually manifested as the variation of the tran-
sition probability between the two ground levels of the
atom. And the transition probability P is typically ex-
pressed as [1, 3]

P = A + B cos(ϕ + ϕm),

(1)

which forms a cosine fringe when the controllable ϕ is
scanned. In Eq. (1), A is the fringe oﬀset, B is the fringe
amplitude, and ϕm indicates the phase shift induced by
the physical quantity to be measured. In conventional
method, a full cosine fringe is obtained by scanning ϕ
step by step, as shown in Fig. 1(a), and ϕm is then ac-
quired by a cosine ﬁtting. Alternatively, the FLM can
be adopted [53–55], as shown in Fig. 1(b). In the fringe-
locking approach, the appropriate value of ϕ, denoted as
ϕ0, is found to make ϕ + ϕm ∼ 2nπ (where n is an in-
teger). Then ϕ is modulated by ±π/2 with respect to
the center of ϕ0 so that the measurement is always per-
formed at midfringe, alternately to the right and to the
left side of the central fringe. In this case, the transition
probabilities P for every two consecutive launches can

method, the phase is scanned step by step, while in the FLM,
the phase is modulated by ±π/2 with respect to an appro-
priate center, denoted as ϕ0 here. The dash lines are here to

be expressed as

P [2l − 1] = A + B cos(ϕ0 + ϕm − π/2),

(2a)

P [2l] = A + B cos(ϕ0 + ϕm + π/2),

(2b)

where l (l = 1, 2, 3, · · · )denotes the index of modulat-
ing cycles. The diﬀerence between P [2l − 1] and P [2l]
could be used as a criterion of whether ϕ0 + ϕm = 2nπ
is fulﬁlled, which thus enables feedback control of ϕ0.
According to the linear approximating of Eq.
(2) at
midfringe, the correction can be expressed as

δ(ϕ0) = (P [2l] − P [2l − 1])/2B,

(3)

where the fringe amplitude B must be known in advance
by scanning full fringe. Once the corrections are made to
form a closed feedback loop, the equation ϕ0 +ϕm = 2nπ
is supposed to be enable, from which the value of the
interested ϕm can be deduced from ϕ0 in a linear way.
It is shown in Eq. (3) that when the interferometers is
operated at the midfringe, the measurement works in a
linear region. This linearization character is helpful for
signal extraction in the WEP test of dual-species kind,
as will be discussed detailedly in the following section.

3. Application in WEP Test
In the above section, the fringe-locking approach for sin-
gle interferometer is illuminated, and the Raman laser
phase is convenient to control, which thus usually plays
the role of ϕ. Generally speaking, one needs two inde-
pendent controllable phases to simultaneously lock two
interferometers. In Ref. 16, in addition to Raman laser

phase, the phase shift due to magnetic ﬁeld gradient
is explored as the other controllable phase for an atom
gravity gradiometer. In WEP test using simultaneous
dual-species atom interferometers, there are already two
independent groups of Raman lasers (usually one group
used for one specie atom), and thus it is natural to ex-
plore the two controllable Raman laser phases for fringe
locking.

For each specie atom interferometer using π/2 − π −
π/2 Raman pulses scheme, the controllable phase ϕ,
namely the Raman lasers phase, can be expressed as
[33, 50, 52, 57]

ϕj = αj(Tj + 2τj)(Tj + 4τj/π) ≡ αjfDC(Tj, τj),

(4)

where αj is the chirp rate of the eﬀective Raman laser
frequency used to compensate the Doppler shift due to
gravity, and τj is the π/2 pulse duration. With the Ra-
man pulses duration eﬀect neglected, fDC(Tj, τj) just
simpliﬁes to T 2
j . And the interested phase ϕm, namely
the phase related to the gravity acceleration, can be ex-
pressed as [33, 50, 52, 57]

(ϕm)j = keﬀ

j gjfDC(Tj, τj),

(5)

where the gravity acceleration of j specie atoms is de-
noted as gj to account for possible WEP violation. In
order to clearly manifest the ability of common-mode
rejection with FLM, the phase due to vibration is ex-
plicitly included in the total phase shift, which can be
expressed as [33, 50, 52, 57]

j h(Tj, τj; a(t), (ti)j),

(6)

where ξ(t) is the sensitivity function [58], and ti
is
the central time of the interfering progress for the i-th
shot measurement. We note that both fDC(Tj, τj) and
h(Tj, τj; a(t), ti) are irrelative to keﬀ
[33, 50, 52, 57]. And
j
in the case of identical pulses separation time (namely
T1 = T2 ≡ T ), identical eﬀective Rabi frequencies (thus
τ1 = τ2 ≡ τ ), and simultaneous interferometers (thus
(ti)1 = (ti)2 ≡ ti as well as experiencing the same vibra-
tion noise a(t)), they are identical for the dual-species
atom interferometers. This is exactly the situation we
hope (and also are able to) manage to achieve, and here
we then abbreviate fDC(T, τ ) and h(T, τ ; a(t), ti) as fDC
and h[i], respectively.

Once the appropriate value of Raman laser phase, de-
noted as ϕ0
j , are found to make ϕj + (ϕm)j ∼ 2njπ for
each interferometers, the Raman laser phases are then
modulated by ±π/2. The corresponding transition prob-
abilities for the two interferometers for every two con-
secutive launches can be expressed as

(7b)

And as same as in single interferometer, the correction
is made as

δ((ϕ0

j )[l]) = (Pj[2l] − Pj[2l − 1])/2Bj,

(8)

j )[l + 1] = (ϕ0

where l denotes the l-th correction (the index of ϕ0
j is
explicitly indicated here). The (l + 1)-th phase modula-
tion center will be (ϕ0
j )[l]). And
for single interferometer, the l-th measured value of the
gravity acceleration is then expressed as (gmeas)j[l] =
(2njπ − ϕ0
j fDC. This measured value
is obviously aﬀected by the vibration noise, which can
be actually explicitly deduced from the linear approxi-
mation of Eq. (7) at midfringe, namely

j [l]− δ((ϕ0

j )[l] + δ((ϕ0

j )[l]))/keﬀ

(gmeas)j [l] = gj + (h[2l − 1] + h[2l])/2fDC.

(9)

However, the measured WEP violation signal is the dif-
ference of the measured gravity accelerations, which is
then expressed as

(∆g)meas[l] ≡ (gmeas)1[l] − (gmeas)2[l] = g1 − g2,

(10)

which is exactly the possible WEP violation signal one
searches for. It is clearly shown from Eq. (10) that the
FLM promises a perfect common-mode rejection of vi-
bration noise within the ﬁrst order approximation for
WEP tests using simultaneous dual-species atom inter-
ferometers. And this common-mode rejection capability
proﬁts from the linearized signal extraction.

4. Simulation and Result
(9) is based on the linear approximation of the
Eq.
measurement equation Eq.
(7), and so is the conse-
quent common-mode rejection. Actually, vibration noise
would cause a departure of the measurement point from
midfringe, which would then aﬀect the linear approx-
imation. It is easily imaged that this aﬀection will in-
crease with the noise level. And since the vibration noise
induced phases for the two interferometers are diﬀerent,
the relative sites of the measurement points at respective
fringe are also diﬀerent, which will limit the common-
mode rejection capability of this fringe-locking method.
The rejection capability will be investigated here by nu-
merical simulation. For simplicity, in the simulation the
transition probabilities are re-written as

P1 = A1 + B1 cos(ϕ1 + (ϕg)1 + ϕvib),

(11a)

P2 = A2 + B2 cos(ϕ2 + r(ϕg)2 + rϕvib),

(11b)

where (ϕg)1 is equivalent to (ϕm)1, and (ϕg)2 is de-
ﬁned as (ϕg)2 ≡ keﬀ
1 g2fDC. With this redeﬁnition,
(ϕg)1 = (ϕg)2 in the absence of WEP violation. The
vibration noise is simulated by randomly drawing the

value for the dual-species of 39K versus 87Rb.

values of ϕvib in a Gaussian distribution with a stan-
dard deviation of σϕvib. To simulate the fringe locking,
the Raman laser phase ϕ1 (ϕ2) is modulated by ±π/2
with a center of ϕ0
2), and the corrections for every
two consecutive launches is made as Eq. (8) (The initial
values of ϕ1 and ϕ2 are −(ϕg)1 and −r(ϕg)2, respec-
tively). The corresponding measured phase shifts due
to gravity acceleration are then (ϕg)meas
1 and
(ϕg)meas
2/r, respectively, from which the inter-
ested possible WEP violation signal can be deduced as
∆Φg ≡ (ϕg)1 − (ϕg)2 = −(ϕ0
In the numerical simulation, the dependence of the
common-mode rejection eﬃciency on the vibration noise
level (characterized by σϕvib) and the ratio of the eﬀec-
tive Raman wave vector (characterized by r) is investi-
gated. For each σϕvib and r, 104 modulation cycles are
simulated for the two interferometers, in which process
2 × 104 pairs (P1, P2) are generated with A1 = A2 = 0.5
and B1 = B2 = 0.5 and 104 pairs ((ϕg)meas
, (ϕg)meas
)
are obtained. The inﬂuence of the vibration noise on
the interested signal is characterized by the Allan devi-
ation of the ∆Φg, which is calculated by the obtained
pairs ((ϕg)meas
). Since the simulated vibra-
tion noise is white noise, the calculated Allan deviation
g (N ), scales down by the in-
of ∆Φg, denoted as σ∆Φ
verse square-root of the number of measurement, namely
/√N . Here N denotes the number of
σ∆Φ
measurements, and σ1
stands for the measurement
sensitivity, which is obtained by white noise model ﬁt-
ting of σ∆Φ

The eﬃciency of the common-mode noise rejection is
characterized by the rejection ratio σϕvib/σ1
. The
simulation result for the dependence of the rejection ra-
tio on the vibration noise level σϕvib is shown in Fig. 2.
According to the logarithmic ﬁt in Fig. 2, the rejection
ratio scales by −38.2(1) dB per octave, which is very
close to the expected value of −40 dB per octave as a

result of the third order expansion of the sinusoid func-
tion. This means that the common-mode noise rejection
capability of the fringe-locking method improves quite
fast as the vibration noise decreases. This simulation
also tells that even if the vibration noise is as large as 1
rad, there is still about 33 dB rejection ratio for the 39K
versus 87Rb dual-species interferometers.

The simulation for diﬀerent r is then performed with
a ﬁxed vibration noise level of σϕvib = 1 mrad. The
result is shown in Fig. 3, which also shows a logarithmic
relation. According to the logarithmic ﬁt, the rejection
ratio scales down by −19.98(4) dB per octave.
It is
shown that even if the deviation of the ratio from unity
is as large as 1, there is still about 110 dB rejection ratio
for σϕvib = 1 mrad.

In addition to common-mode noise rejection capabil-
ity, the bias of the extracted ∆Φg is also much con-
cerned. We have checked that the average value of ∆Φg
extracted by this fringe-locking method is exactly equal
to the diﬀerential value of the set (ϕg)1 and (ϕg)2, what-
ever the vibration noise level (as long as σϕvib ≤ 1 rad)
and the ratio of the eﬀective Raman wave vector are.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
The simulation for diﬀerent fringe amplitudes of the two
interferometers (namely B1 6= B2) is also performed,
and the dependence of the rejection ratio on σϕvib and
r doesn’t change. This is consistent with our knowl-
edge.
In the presence of only phase noises, the abso-
lute value of the amplitude doesn’t matter much for the
FLM as long as it is exactly known. In actual experi-
ment, the fringe amplitudes of the two interferometers
are pre-determined by scanning the full fringe and then
performing cosine ﬁttings. In the fringe-locking mode,
the realtime information about the fringe amplitudes is
lost, of which possible drift will aﬀect the fringe-locking.
This can be resolved by occasionally switching back to

the full-fringe recording mode to get renewed fringe am-
plitudes.

In conclusion, we have shown the capability of
common-mode noise
rejection using fringe-locking
method in WEP test by simultaneous dual-species atom
interferometers. We note that it is quite convenient to
perform this method in the dual-species interferometers,
and it is also quite direct to extract the signal. Of im-
portance, this signal extraction approach allows for an
unbiased determination of the gravity accelerations dif-
ference, and aﬀords a good common-mode noise rejec-
tion, especially in the low vibration noise level. This
will thus greatly alleviate the demand for the vibration
noise isolation in WEP test of dual-species kind.
