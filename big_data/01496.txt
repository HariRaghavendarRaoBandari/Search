Abstract

We use heuristic algorithms to ﬁnd terraces for small groups. We show that
Bailey’s Conjecture (that all groups other than the non-cyclic elementary abelian
2-groups are terraced) holds up to order 511, except possibly at orders 256 and
384. We also show that Keedwell’s Conjecture (that all non-abelian groups of order
at least 10 are sequenceable) holds up to order 255, and for the groups A6, S6,
PSL(2, q1) and PGL(2, q2) where q1 and q2 are prime powers with 3 ≤ q1 ≤ 11 and
3 ≤ q2 ≤ 8. A sequencing for a group of a given order implies the existence of a
complete latin square at that order. We show that there is a sequenceable group
for each odd order up to 555 at which there is a non-abelian group. This gives 31
new orders at which complete latin squares are now known to exist, the smallest
of which is 63.
In addition, we consider terraces with some special properties,
including constructing a directed T2-terrace for the non-abelian group of order 21
and hence a Roman-2 square of order 21 (the ﬁrst known such square of odd order).
Finally we report the total number terraces and directed terraces for groups of order
at most 15.

Introduction

Let G be a group of order n. Let (a1, a2, . . . , an) be an arrangement of the elements of
G and deﬁne b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn−1) by bi = a−1
i ai+1 for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. If the
elements of b are distinct then a is a directed terrace for G and b is a sequencing. A
group that has a directed terrace and sequencing is called sequenceable.

Gordon [18] introduced the concept as a tool for constructing “complete Latin squares”;
the same ideas had been used earlier in cyclic groups [33]. A Latin square of order n is
an n × n array of n symbols with each symbol appearing once in each row and once in
each column. A Latin square is row-complete, and is also known as a Roman square, if
each ordered pair of symbols appears in consecutive positions within rows exactly once.

If the transpose is also row-complete, the square is complete. Gordon showed that if
(a1, a2, . . . , an) is a directed terrace for a group of order n then the Latin square with
(i, j) entry a−1

i aj is complete.

A binary group is deﬁned to be a group with a single involution. An abelian group
is sequenceable if and only if it is a binary group and the three non-abelian groups of
orders 6 and 8 are not sequenceable [18]. Many non-abelian groups and families of non-
abelian groups have since been shown to have directed terraces, for example the dihedral
and dicyclic groups of order at least 10. No further exceptions are known. See [23] for a
survey of the current state of aﬀairs.

Keedwell’s Conjecture is that all non-abelian groups of order at least 10 are sequence-
able. In the next section we show that it holds up to order 255 and that for each odd order
of at most 555 at which there is a non-abelian group there is at least one sequenceable
group.

Bailey [15] generalised the notion of a sequencing (and introduced the terrace termi-
nology) for use in constructing “quasi-complete Latin squares”. A Latin square is row
quasi-complete if each pair of symbols appears twice (in either order) in adjacent cells
within rows of the square. If the transpose of a row quasi-complete square is also row
quasi-complete then the square is quasi-complete.

With the arrangement a and associated list b as above, if each involution occurs
exactly once in b and if for each x ∈ G with x2 6= e the sequence b contains x and
x−1 twice in total then a is a terrace for G and b is its associated 2-sequencing.
If
(a1, a2, . . . , an) is a terrace for a group of order n then the Latin square with (i, j) entry
a−1
i aj is quasi-complete [15].

Non-cyclic elementary abelian 2-groups are not terraced [15] and Bailey’s Conjecture
is that these are the only groups that do not have a terrace. As with the directed
case, many families of groups are known to be terraced, see [23]. For example, Bailey’s
Conjecture holds for abelian groups [30]. In the next section we show that the conjecture
is true up to order 511, with the possible exceptions of 256 and 384, and this and the
results of Section 3 imply the existence of terraces for new inﬁnite families of groups.

A sequence remains a terrace (or directed terrace) if we left-multiply all of its elements
by any ﬁxed group element. Taking the element to be a−1
1 gives a terrace that starts with
e; such terraces are called basic. Two terraces are essentially diﬀerent if, after making
them both basic by left-multiplying by a group element, there is not an automorphism
of the group that sends one to the other.

Example 1.1 Let Zn denote the additively written cyclic group of order n on the symbol
set {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. The sequence

(0, 1, n − 1, 2, n − 2, 3, n − 3 . . .)

is a terrace for Zn. When n is even it is directed. The earliest publications of this
construction seem to be [22] for even n, where credit is given to Walecki, and [33] for
odd n.

In [1], Anderson introduces a hill-climbing algorithm for ﬁnding directed terraces and
he uses a variant of it in [9] to look for terraces. We describe our similar algorithms
in the next section and report on which groups for which we were able to ﬁnd terraces

2

and sequencings. The algorithms are implemented in GAP [17] and are available at the
following website:

http://cs.marlboro.edu/courses/matt/terraces

In Section 3 we consider terraces that have special properties that let them be used
for general constructions of terraces for larger groups, for constructing combinatorial
objects or are of interest for their own sake. Finally, in Section 4 we report on exhaustive
searches that take our full knowledge of how many essentially diﬀerent terraces and
directed terraces there are for all groups up to order 15.

Some groups we use: D2m is the dihedral group of order 2m; Q4m is the dicyclic group
of order 4m, which is the quaternion group when m = 2 and the generalised quaternion
group when m is a larger power of 2; An and Sn are alternating and symmetric groups
respectively; and PSL(n, q) and PGL(n, q), where q is a prime power, are the projective
special and projective linear groups respectively.

For other groups when there is no commonly used name we use the notation Gn,i for
the group of order n in position i of GAP’s Small Group Library [17]. We use two such
groups in examples and so give presentations for them here. The ﬁrst is the unique-up-
to-isomorphism non-abelian group of order 21:

G21,1 = hu, v : u7 = e = v3, vu = u4vi.

This is the smallest non-abelian group of odd order. The second is one of the two non-
abelian groups of order 27:

G27,4 = hu, v : u9 = e = v3, vu = u7vi.

The proofs consist almost entirely of reports that the appropriate computer programs
have run successfully. As such they are omitted except for occasional “proof notes” that
contain some commentary.

2 Keedwell’s and Bailey’s Conjectures

We ﬁrst consider directed terraces and Keedwell’s Conjecture.

For a hill-climbing algorithm we need three ingredients: a search space through which
we shall move, a neighbourhood that can be constructed for any element of the search
space to give the potential next steps of our movement and a measure of our altitude
(including knowing what altitude is suﬃciently “high” to be a solution to the problem).
We also include a “teleport” function that moves us a signiﬁcant distance across the
search space without too much loss of altitude as a means for escaping local maxima.

For an arrangement a = (a1, a2, . . . , an) of the elements of a group G of order n, deﬁne
b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn−1) as usual by bi = a−1
i ai+1 for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The search
space is the set of all arrangements of the group elements and the altitude of such an
arrangement a is the number of distinct elements of b. The sequence a is a directed
terrace if and only if its altitude is n − 1.

For movement we cut the sequence into a small number of pieces and reassemble them
in any order. For example, if we cut (a1, a2, . . . an) at position i and change the order of

3

the two subsequences we reach the sequence

(ai+1, ai+2, . . . , an, a1, a2, . . . ai).

With two cuts there are ﬁve possible places to move that are diﬀerent to our starting
sequence.

These moves correspond well with our altitude measure as the portions of b generated
by the subsequences do not change. Using a move with k cuts, the altitude can be reduced
at most k and increased by up to 2k. This means we have a fairly smooth landscape.

The teleport function takes a random element of the sequence and moves it to the

end. This reduces the altitude by at most 2.

The algorithm is now straightforward to describe.

1. Begin with a random arrangement of the elements of G.

2. If the altitude is n−1 then we have a directed terrace; return it. Otherwise continue

to Step 3.

3. Look through the neighbours of the arrangement one at a time and as soon as we
see a higher one take that to be our new position and return to Step 2. If there are
no higher neighbours, continue to Step 4.

4. Teleport and return to Step 2.

The number of cuts was limited to 2. Experiments with 3 cuts suggested that the reduc-
tion in the number of steps to a solution was outweighed by the time taken to search for
a beneﬁcial 3-cut move.

Here is the collected outcome of the searches. Anderson [1, 2] has already shown that

it is true up to order 32 and for A5 and S5 using a similar algorithm.

Theorem 2.1 All non-abelian groups of order n with 10 ≤ n ≤ 255 are sequenceable.
Also, the groups A6, S6, PSL(2, q1) and PGL(2, q2) are sequenceable where q1 and q2 are
prime powers with 3 ≤ q1 ≤ 11 and 3 ≤ q2 ≤ 8.

As a directed terrace for a group of order n can be used to construct a complete
Latin square of order n and there are many odd orders for which these are unknown, the
program was pushed further on groups of odd order.

Theorem 2.2 For all odd orders n ≤ 555 for which there is a non-abelian group of
order n there is at least one sequenceable group of order n.

Proof note. Although theoretical constructions are known for several odd orders [21, 26,
32] the program was run and found directed terraces at these orders in any case.

At some values of n there are several non-abelian groups. In these instances we found
a sequencing for the ﬁrst one in the ordering given by GAP’s Small Group Library. ✷

We collect the orders new to this work in the following result:

4

Corollary 2.3 There is at least one sequenceable group at each of the orders

63, 105, 117, 135, 165, 171, 189, 195, 225, 231, 273, 275, 279, 285, 297, 315,
333, 351, 357, 385, 387, 405, 429, 459, 465, 483, 495, 513, 525, 549, 555.

Hence there is a complete latin square of each of these orders.

For Bailey’s Conjecture, where the sequences have more freedom, we use more-or-less

the same algorithm and are able to push to higher orders.

The changes to the algorithm are to the deﬁnition of altitude and the possible move-

ment.

Given a and b with the usual notation, the altitude of a is now deﬁned to be the sum
of number of distinct involutions in b and the number of occurrences of each element
g ∈ G with g2 6= e up to a maximum of two from g and g−1 combined. The altitude is
n − 1 if and only if a is a terrace.

The idea of cutting and regluing remains the key to movement, but we now take
advantage of the fact that if we reverse a subsequence of a then the elements of the portion
of b that is generated are switched for their inverses. This does not aﬀect the altitude
(for not-necessarily-directed terraces) and so after making one or two cuts as before we
allow reversing the subsequences before re-assembly of the pieces. For example, we might
make one cut, at position i, and reverse the second portion and glue the subsequences in
the original order, to get:

(a1, a2, . . . , ai, an, an−1, . . . ai+1).

As in the directed case, making k cuts can make the altitude at most k lower or at most 2k
higher, and we use the same teleport function that reduces the altitude by at most 2.
The algorithm is now essentially the same as the one given earlier.

Although constructions of directed terraces are available for inﬁnitely many groups,
they are not suﬃciently dense to be worth factoring into the programs. However, for
terraces, we have the following very powerful result:

Theorem 2.4 [10, 11] Let G be a group and let N be a normal subgroup of G. If N
has odd order and G/N is terraced or if N has odd index and N is terraced, then G is
terraced.

This implies, for instance, that all groups of odd order are terraced. Unfortunately,
it does not help with 2-groups, which are by far the most abundant groups in the range
we are considering. However, among the 33,080 non-abelian non-2-groups of order at
most 511 there are just 782 that cannot be terraced by using Theorem 2.4 provided
Bailey’s Conjecture holds at all proper divisors of the order. Further, 29 of these 782
are dihedral groups of order 4p, for p an odd prime, and these groups are known to be
terraced [20].

Factoring in Theorem 2.1 as well (a directed terrace is a terrace), we have 597 groups
of order between 257 and 511 (inclusive) to examine. Of these, 540 have order 384. The
program successfully worked through the others to give:

Theorem 2.5 All non-abelian groups of order n ≤ 511, except possibly n ∈ {256, 384},
are terraced.

5

Proof note. In fact, in many cases the overhead of tracking the more complicated terrace
conditions outweighed the more general nature of a terrace compared to a directed terraces
and so often the directed terrace program was used. ✷

The result up to order 87, except for order 64, is in [9].

3 Special terraces

Recall that a binary group is a group that has a single involution. Let G be a binary group
of order 2m with involution z. Let a = (a1, a2, . . . , a2m) be a directed terrace for G with
associated sequencing b = (b1, b2, . . . , b2m−1). If bm = z and bi = b2m−i for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1
then both the directed terrace and the sequencing are symmetric. The directed terraces
found by Gordon [18] for abelian binary groups are symmetric. Anderson’s Conjecture is
that all binary groups except the quaternion group of order 8 have symmetric sequencings.
In a series of papers [3, 4, 6, 11, 13], Anderson, Ihrig and Leonard extended Gordon’s
result to show that all soluble binary groups, except the quaternion group of order 8,
have symmetric sequencings. In [12] it is shown that given an insoluble binary group G
with involution z, the group G/hzi has a subnormal series

{e} E G2 E G1 E G/hzi

such that |G2| and |(G/hzi)/G1| are odd and G1/G2 is isomorphic to one of A7, PSL(2, q)
or PGL(2, q) for odd prime powers q > 3. Call G1/G2 the group associated with G. It
is also shown that to ﬁnd a symmetric sequencing for a binary group G it is suﬃcient to
ﬁnd a terrace for the group associated with G. For each possible associated group, there
are inﬁnitely many insoluble binary groups that have it as their associated group [12].

It is already known that PSL(2, 5) ∼= A5 is terraced [2]. Theorem 2.1 gives:

Corollary 3.1 If G is an insoluble binary group whose associated group is one of

PSL(2, 7), PSL(2, 9), PSL(2, 11), PGL(2, 5), PGL(2, 7)

then G has a symmetric sequencing.

For undirected terraces a recent approach that allows the construction of terraces
given a normal subgroup that has both even order and index in some cases is to use
“extendable terraces”.

Let a = (a1, a2, . . . , an) be a basic terrace for a group of order n. Then a is extendable
if an = a2
2 and aj−1aj+1 = aj = aj+1aj−1 for some j ≥ 5. The following result does
not include the full power of the machinery (which requires some ﬁddly notation and
conditions) but gives a good sense of what is possible:

Theorem 3.2 [27, 29] Let K be a group with an extendable terrace. Suppose that G has
one of the following forms:

• H1×H2×· · ·×Hs×Zt

2×K where t = 0 or t > 1 and each Hi ∈ {Z6×Z2, D8, D12, A4},

• A × K where A is an abelian 2-group that has a normal series with each factor

isomorphic to Z2
2,

6

• Z2 × Z4 × K and |K| is congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 (mod 7).

Then G has an extendable terrace.

Proof note. The third part of the statement is not explicitly stated elsewhere. However,
it follows immediately from Theorem 4 and the proof of Theorem 2 of [27]. ✷

It is known that groups of order congruent to 2 modulo 4 cannot have an extendable
terrace and that groups of order 6 or less or the non-abelian groups of order 8 do not have
extendable terraces. Conversely, several families of groups—including cyclic groups not
ruled out in the previous sentence, dihedral groups of order a non-trivial multiple of 8,
and each of the non-abelian groups of orders 12, 16 and 20—do have extendable terraces,
see [27].

Rather than designing a new algorithm to attempt to look directly for extendable

terraces we used a method to generate lots of terraces from a given one.

Given a terrace, there are multiple ways to cut it into two pieces and reassemble into
a new terrace (this is similar to the process of the terrace-ﬁnding algorithm, except here
the goal is to maintain the perfect altitude rather than to climb). If we forbid reversing
either of the pieces but include reversing the whole terrace (which always gives a new
terrace) we get an orbit of terraces. The number of essentially diﬀerent terraces in an
orbit must divide either 4 or 6 [15].

By allowing moves that reverse one piece, we can form a chain of terraces that, often,
encompasses many essentially diﬀerent ones. For example, of the 138,066 essentially
diﬀerent terraces for Z13, 137,592 are mutually reachable from each other via these moves
[24]. It is perhaps better to think of the landscape in which the heuristic algorithms are
operating as containing many connected ridges of the desired altitude rather than hills
with distinct peaks.

The strategy for ﬁnding an extendable terrace was to ﬁnd a terrace using one of the
algorithms from the previous section and then quickly generate lots of terraces for the
group using these moves. The property of being extendable is suﬃciently common that
we were able to reach this result:

Theorem 3.3 Every group of order n with 12 ≤ n < 96 and n 6≡ 2 (mod 4) has an
extendable terrace.

In conjunction with Theorem 3.2 (or the more general results of [27]) this gives more
inﬁnite families of groups that are known to be terraced. While this is the most eﬀective
method known to date for terracing large numbers of 2-groups, it barely scratches the
surface of, for example, the 10,494,213 groups of order 512.

We now consider a stronger property than completeness that Latin squares may pos-

sess and what group theoretic structures allow us to construct such squares.

A Roman-k square is a Latin square with the property that for each pair of distinct
symbols x and y and for each integer m with 1 ≤ m ≤ k we have y appearing m cells to
the right of x at most once. A Roman-1 square is simply a Roman square. A Roman-
(n − 1) square is called a Vatican square. If both a square and its transpose are Roman-k
then then it is called k-complete.

7

Vatican squares are known to exist only of order one less than a prime. In addition,
Roman-2 squares exist for orders 2p, where p is a prime congruent to 5, 7 or 19 modulo 24,
and k = 2, and for orders n = 2m with 5 ≤ m ≤ 25, see [16].

Let a = (a1, a2, . . . , an) be a terrace for a group G of order n. For each m with
1 ≤ m ≤ n − 1, deﬁne b(m) = (b(m)
i ai+m. Fix k ≤ n − 1.
If for each m ≤ k there are no repeats within b(m) then a is a directed Tk-terrace. A
directed T1-terrace is a directed terrace and b(1) is its sequencing.

If (a1, a2, . . . , an) is a directed Tk-terrace for a group of order n then the Latin square
i aj is k-complete [7]. Each of the known Vatican and Roman-2 squares

with (i, j)-entry a−1
listed above is constructed in this way from a directed Tk-terrace for a cyclic group.

As there was no known Roman-2 square of odd order, the non-abelian group of or-
der 21—the smallest group of odd order that might admit a directed T2-terrace—is of
particular interest. The heuristic algorithm was unsuccessful and so a backtracking ap-
proach was used. Here is a directed T2-terrace for G21,1:

(e, v, u, v2, u4, u2v, u4v2, u6v2, uv, u3, u3v2, u2, u6, u5v, u2v2, uv2, u5v2, u4v, u3v, u6v, u5).

Hence there is a Roman-2 square of order 21.

We were also able to ﬁnd the ﬁrst directed T2-terraces for non-cyclic groups of even

order. The following theorem collects the results:

Theorem 3.4 The groups A4, Q12, Q16, G16,6, G16,13 and all non-abelian groups of or-
ders n with 18 ≤ n ≤ 22 have a directed T2-terrace. Other non-abelian groups of order at
most 22 do not have a directed T2-terrace. Also, Z6 × Z3 and S4 have directed T2-terraces.
The only groups of order less than 20 that have a directed T3-terrace are the cyclic

groups of order p − 1 for prime p.

Proof note. The terraces that prove this are available at the website associated with this
paper, the link for which is given in the introduction. As an example, here is the directed
T2-terrace for A4:

((), (2, 3, 4), (1, 2)(3, 4), (1, 3)(2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 3),

(1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 2), (1, 3, 2), (1, 2, 3), (2, 4, 3), (1, 4)(2, 3)). ✷

The ﬁnal type of terrace that has attracted interest that we consider here is the

half-and-half terrace and the stronger narcissistic terrace introduced in [14].

Let a = (a1, a2, . . . , an) be a terrace for a group G of odd order n and b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn−1)

If there is one occurrence of from each set {g, g−1 : g2 6= e} in
be its 2-sequencing.
(b1, b2, . . . , b(n−1)/2), and hence also one occurrence from that set in (b(n+1)/2, . . . , bn),
then a is a half-and-half terrace. If b is equal to its reverse then b is reﬂective and a is
narcissistic. Narcissistic terraces are necessarily half-and-half.

It is known that all abelian groups of odd order have a narcissistic terrace and that
G21,1 has a directed half-and-half terrace and a narcissistic terrace [28]. For non-abelian
groups, the following result enables the construction of inﬁnite families of examples of
half-and-half and narcissistic terraces:

8

Theorem 3.5 [28] Let G and H be groups of odd order. If G and H have half-and-half
terraces then G × H has a half-and-half terrace. If G and H have narcissistic terraces
then G × H has a narcissistic terrace.

Similarly to the case with directed T2-terraces, a backtracking approach was more

successful than the heuristic algorithm.

Theorem 3.6 Each of the two non-abelian groups of order 27 has both a narcissistic and
a directed half-and-half terrace. The non-abelian group G39,1 of order 39 has a directed
half-and-half terrace.

Proof note. The terraces that prove the result are available at the website associated with
this paper, the link for which is given in the introduction. We include here a narcissistic
terrace and a directed half-and-half terrace for G27,4:

e, v, u, v2, u4v2, u5v, u4, u5v2, u6v2, u3v2, uv2, u8, u2v, u5,

u8v2, u2, u6v, u7v, u4v, u8v, u6, u2v2, u3v, uv, u3, u7v2, u7)

e, v, u, v2, u4v2, u7v, u8v2, u2, u3v2, u5v, uv, u5, u8,

u3, u8v, u4, uv2, u6v2, u7, u4v, u2v2, u2v, u6v, u3v, u5v2, u7v2, u6 ✷

4 Very small groups

In this section we report on enumerations of terraces and directed terraces in groups of
order up to 15. Let t(G) denoted the number of essentially diﬀerent terraces of G and
d(G) denote the number of essentially diﬀerent directed terraces of G.

For groups of order at most 9, Z10, Z11 and Z13 the values of t(G) and d(G) have
already been computed, sometimes by hand [15, 24, 31]. There are two known errors in
these computations: [31] gives t(Z5) = 2 rather than 3 and [15] gives t(Z2
3) = 32 rather
than 35. Other than those, the new computation matched these results. We give the
results of the computation for 5 ≤ |G| ≤ 15 in Table 1. Each of Z2, Z3 and Z4 has
exactly one terrace, which is directed for Z2 and Z4. Elementary abelian 2-groups have
no terraces.
