ABSTRACT

EX Lupi-type objects (EXors) form a sub-class of T Tauri stars, deﬁned

by sudden sporadic ﬂare-ups of 1-5 magnitudes at optical wavelengths. These

eruptions are attributed to enhanced mass accretion from the circumstellar disk

to the star, and may constitute important events in shaping the structure of the

inner disk and the forming planetary system. Although disk properties must

play a fundamental role in driving the outbursts, they are surprisingly poorly

known.

In order to characterize the dust and gas components of EXor disks,

here we report on observations of the 12CO J=3–2 and 4–3 lines, and the 13CO

3–2 line in EX Lup, the prototype of the EXor class. We reproduce the observed

line ﬂuxes and proﬁles with a line radiative transfer model, and compare the

obtained parameters with corresponding ones of other T Tauri disks.

Introduction

EX Lup is the prototype of EXors, one of the two main classes of young eruptive

stars. EXors are young low-mass T Tauri stars exhibiting repetitive outbursts due

to a sudden increase of the accretion rate (Herbig 1977, 2008).

In 2008, EX Lup

exhibited its largest outburst ever observed, triggering a series of multi-wavelength and

multi-epoch investigations of the accretion process. These led to the discovery of the

annealing of amorphous silicate particles to crystalline grains during the outburst and their

transportation to the outer comet-forming zone ( ´Abrah´am et al. 2009; Juh´asz et al. 2012).

Changes in the molecular features of H2O, OH, and H2 indicate that the outburst aﬀected

not only the surface mineralogy, but also the chemistry in the inner disk (Banzatti et al.

2012). Using high resolution spectroscopic and spectroastrometric tools, Goto et al. (2011),

K´osp´al et al. (2011), and Sicilia-Aguilar et al. (2012) concluded that the high accretion rate

responsible for the outburst mostly aﬀected the innermost 0.4 au region. They detected an

accretion-related wind and the motion of non-axisymmetric distribution of material in the

inner disk.

The emerging picture is broadly consistent with the magnetospheric accretion scenario,

in which the infalling material reaches the star in hot spots. Indeed, X-ray and UV

observations by Grosso et al. (2010) and by Teets et al. (2012) indicate accretion shocks.

Recently, K´osp´al et al. (2014) and Sicilia-Aguilar et al. (2015) studied the radial velocity

variations of optical absorption and emission lines, and discussed diﬀerent interpretation in

terms of a possible brown dwarf companion on a tight eccentric orbit around EX Lup, or

emission from stable accretion columns in the system.

All the observations summarized above concentrated on the inner part of the disk,

within a few au of the star. However, the structure and dynamics of the outer disk must

play a signiﬁcant role in driving the outburst by replenishing the material in the inner

– 4 –

disk after each eruption. It is an open question whether the outer disks of EXors diﬀer in

any way from the disks of normal T Tauri stars. A negative answer could suggest that all

low-mass stars undergo EXor phases during their early evolution.

Very few information is available on the outer disk or on global disk properties

of the prototype, EX Lup. The emission of the cold dust component was detected at

infrared wavelengths (Gras-Vel´azquez & Ray 2005; Sipos et al. 2009), and at 870 µm with

APEX/LABOCA (Juh´asz et al. 2012). Modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED)

based on these data, Sipos et al. 2009 and Juh´asz et al. (2012) deduced a modestly ﬂared

disk geometry. In the lack of spatially resolved infrared or millimeter data, the outer disk

radius of EX Lup is unknown. Much less is known about the gas component. Warm carbon

monoxide (CO) gas was detected in the fundamental lines at 4.5 µm and in the overtone

band at 2.3 µm (Aspin et al. 2010; Goto et al. 2011; K´osp´al et al. 2011). The proﬁles of the

fundamental lines could be well ﬁtted with an inner disk inclination angle between 40◦ and

50◦ (Goto et al. 2011). Concerning the cold gas in the disk, the only available millimeter

CO observation reported in the literature, a 12CO(3–2) line targeted by van Kempen et al.

(2007) using JCMT, was a non-detection.

In order to study the abundance, distribution, and kinematics of cold molecular gas in

EX Lup’s disk, we obtained new submillimeter CO line observations with APEX/FLASH+.

In this Letter, we present the data and analyze the line proﬁles, line intensities, measure

the CO mass, optical depth, reproduce the results with a chemical and radiative transfer

model, and confront the results with those obtained for typical T Tauri-type stars.

2. Observations

We used the FLASH+ receiver (Klein et al. 2012) at the APEX telescope (G¨usten et al.

2006) to measure the 12CO(3–2), 13CO(3–2), and 12CO(4–3) lines towards EX Lup on 2015

March 30 – April 1. The lower frequency channel was tuned to 344.2 GHz in USB to cover

the 13CO(3–2) at 330.588 GHz, and the CO(3–2) at 345.796 GHz, respectively. The higher

frequency channel was tuned to the 12CO(4–3) line at 461.041 GHz in USB. We used the

XFFTS backends providing a nominal 38.15 kHz spectral resolution. Observations were

carried out in position switching mode with a relative reference position 100′′ away.

The spectra have been averaged and a ﬁrst order baseline has been removed. The

noise level on a T∗

A scale in 1 km/s channels is 5.2 mK (0.21 Jy) for 12CO(3–2), 11.5 mK

(0.55 Jy) for 12CO(4–3), and 7.7 mK (0.32 Jy) for 13CO(3–2). We used a Jy-to-K conversion

of 41 Jy/K for the 3–2 lines and 48 Jy/K for the 4–3 line to convert from T∗

A scale to ﬂux

scale. The telescope’s beam is 19.′′2, and 15.′′3 at the corresponding frequencies.

3. Results and Analysis

Our CO spectra are plotted in Fig. 1. The 12CO lines are securely detected at 12σ

and 7.7σ levels for the 3–2 and 4–3 lines, respectively. There is a marginal detection of the

13CO(3–2) line at a level of 2.6σ, at the same radial velocity as the other CO lines. The

observed lines are single-peaked. The peak ﬂuxes, total line intensities, line widths (FWHM

of ﬁtted Gaussians), and line positions (centers of the ﬁtted Gaussians) are presented in

Tab. 1.

The ratio of the 3–2 lines of the two diﬀerent CO isotopologues can be used to calculate

the optical depths of the lines. If we denote the optical depths of 12CO and 13CO by

τ12 and τ13, respectively, then the ratio of the 12CO to the 13CO line is approximately

– 6 –

(1 − e−τ12)/(1 − e−τ13). Assuming that the optical depths of the diﬀerent isotopologues

follow the same proportions as the abundance ratios typical of local interstellar matter

(Wilson 1999), τ12 = 69×τ13. Using these numbers, we obtained τ12 ≈ 20 and τ13 ≈ 0.3.

Even considering the uncertainties in this evaluation, it is very likely that the 12CO lines

are optically thick, while the 13CO line is optically thin.

The temperature of the CO gas can be estimated from the ratio of the optically

thick 12CO(4–3) and 12CO(3–2) lines. In the Rayleigh–Jeans approximation, the ratio is

expected to be the ratio of the squares of the line frequencies, i.e., about 1.78. Instead,

using the total ﬂux values from Tab. 1, we obtain 1.25±0.15, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the

Rayleigh–Jeans value. The low value suggests that the temperature is very low and that

the Rayleigh–Jeans approximation is not valid. Indeed, using the Planck function, this line

ratio corresponds to 10+4

−2 K.

From the optically thin 13CO line, using the canonical 10−4 CO-to-H2 abundance ratio,

we estimate a total disk mass of 2.3×10−4 M⊙. If the abundance ratio is lower than 10−4,

as will be discussed in Sect. 5.2, then this disk mass should be considered as a lower limit.

4. Chemical and Radiative Transfer Modeling

In order to reproduce the observed line proﬁles and line ﬂuxes, we made a detailed

chemical and radiative transfer model of the EX Lup disk. As a base, we used the model

of Sipos et al. (2009) to ﬁt the quiescent spectral energy distribution (SED), providing

radial and vertical dust density and dust temperature distributions. We used this physical

model and performed a detailed simulation of the disk chemistry similarly to that described

in Gorti et al. (2011). The CO abundance, densities, and temperatures were calculated

without assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), and included radiative

– 7 –

pumping, dust background radiation, and spontaneous emission and collisions. In parallel,

we veriﬁed the results with the state-of-the-art chemical code ALCHEMIC (Semenov et al.

2010), and found similar results. The obtained gas-phase 12CO fractional abundances were

used as input for our line transport calculations, performed with the radmc-3d code1.

We assumed a homogeneous gas-to-dust ratio of 100 and a Keplerian velocity ﬁeld with

a microturbulent velocity of 0.1 km/s, taken to be constant throughout the disk. The

abundances of 13CO and C18O were calculated using a constant 12CO/13CO ratio of 69 and

12CO/C18O ratio of 560 (Wilson 1999). The obtained densities and temperatures imply

that LTE holds everywhere in the disk, thus we adopted LTE for modeling the line proﬁles.

The gas temperature was assumed to be equal with the dust temperature. The line emission

was calculated in 8 km/s wide windows centered on the rest frame wavelengths of the J=3–2

and 4–3 transitions of 12CO and 13CO.

In Fig. 1 we overplotted the resulting model spectra. In order to match the brightness

of the observed lines, the gas temperature in our model had to be scaled down by a factor

of 0.8. With this small modiﬁcation, all measured line ﬂuxes and line ratios are well

reproduced by our model, indicating that the disk parameters responsible for the line

width were reasonable estimates. This result also conﬁrms that the inclination of 40◦ used

in the radiative transfer calculations is good approximation. The double-peaked proﬁles

characteristic for a disk in Keplerian orbit are not observed probably due to the limited

spectral resolution of the data. We emphasize that while our modeling provides a possible

solution to reproduce the observed lines, it was not a ﬁt to the lines. The exploration of the

full parameter space needed to prove that this is a unique solution is beyond the scope of

this Letter. For this reason, in the following, we base our discussion on our measured CO

line ﬂuxes.

5. Discussion

5.1. Disk mass from dust continuum data

Sipos et al. (2009) assumed small grains and ﬁtted the SED with a total disk mass of

0.025 M⊙. Sicilia-Aguilar et al. (2015) could obtain a reasonably well ﬁt to the SED with

a total mass of 1–3×10−3 M⊙ by using grains between 0.1 and 100 µm with collisional size

distribution. In these studies, when converting the dust mass to total mass, a gas-to-dust

mass ratio of 100 was assumed. While this is typical for the interstellar medium (ISM),

circumstellar disks often have lower gas-to-dust mass ratios. Recently, Williams & Best

(2014) measured values between 43 and 2 for T Tauri stars in Taurus, based on Submillimter

Array (SMA) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum and 13CO(2–1) and C18O(2–1) lines.

Considering these uncertainties, the total disk mass of EX Lup from dust continuum data

may be as high as 0.025 M⊙ (using small grains and gas-to-dust ratio of 100) or as low as

a few times 10−4 M⊙ (using a grain size distribution and a gas-to-dust ratio of 10). While

the lower value is roughly consistent with the disk mass obtained from our 13CO data, the

higher value is about 100 times higher, hinting at signiﬁcant CO depletion in the disk of

EX Lup.

5.2. CO depletion in EX Lup

In order to ﬁnd out whether the disk properties derived from our CO observations

of EX Lup are in any way special, we need to compare it to normal, non-eruptive young

stars. Thi et al. (2001) observed the 13CO(3–2) line in eight T Tauri-type stars and in

seven Herbig Ae stars in the Taurus-Auriga cloud, calculated the total gas masses, and

compared them with total masses inferred from 1.3 mm dust continuum measurements.

They found that “masses derived from CO are generally 10-200 times lower than those

– 9 –

found from the millimeter continuum”. In Fig. 2 we reproduced Fig. 10 from Thi et al.

(2001), and overplotted EX Lup, using the same equations and assumptions to calculate the

disk masses as was used in that paper (we estimated a range of 1.3 mm ﬂuxes for EX Lup by

extrapolating from the 870 µm ﬂux presented in Juh´asz et al. 2012 using β=0...1.7 as the

spectral index of the dust opacity). Compared to the sample of Thi et al. (2001), EX Lup

has a remarkably small disk mass and modest CO depletion. This result means that the

total disk mass might be a factor of 10...100 higher than the value calculated in Sect. 3.

Thi et al. (2001) listed two possible reasons for the CO depletion: (1) freeze-out in

the coldest, mid-plane regions of the disk (indeed, Reboussin et al. (2015) found that the

canonical gas-phase abundance of CO compared to H2 of 10−4 is only reached above about

30 – 35 K, below this temperature, the ratio is much smaller because CO depletion due to

freeze-out is very eﬃcient); (2) photodissociation by stellar or interstellar UV radiation in

the disk surface. These two eﬀects may operate in EX Lup as well. Firstly, according to

our radiative transfer model, the dust temperature in the disk midplane in the outer disk

regions is indeed below 15 K, therefore CO is expected to freeze out. Secondly, the two

M-type stars in the sample of Thi et al. (2001) show similar CO depletion factor (about

100), indicating similar radiation ﬁelds.

The fact that the CO depletion in EX Lup is less than those observed in normal T Tauri

and most of those in Herbig Ae stars as well has interesting implications. EX Lup exhibited

a large outburst in 2008, when both its optical and X-ray brightness increased by orders

of magnitude (K´osp´al et al. 2008; Teets et al. 2012). According to our modeling, both the

midplane and the surface temperature increased in the disk during outburst ( ´Abrah´am et al.

2009). On the one hand, the increased temperature might have evaporated CO ice and

increased the abundance of gas-phase CO, as predicted by Vorobyov et al. (2013). On

the other hand, the increased UV ﬂux during outburst might have photodissociated a

– 10 –

signiﬁcant amount of CO gas. It seems that in the case of EX Lup, the latter eﬀect was more

dominant. Our low-J CO observations trace the bulk of the cold gas, therefore the outburst

aﬀected the outer parts of the disk, and not only its innermost part (where Banzatti et al.

2015 found a depletion of hot CO after the outburst, interpreted as depletion of material

accumulated around and within the corotation radius at 0.02–0.3 au). Our observations

support the conclusions of Vorobyov et al. (2013), whose numerical simulations showed that

the chemical signatures of luminosity bursts in the gas-phase CO abundance may linger for

several thousand years.

5.3. The mechanism of EXor outbursts?

Liu et al. (2016) observed four EXors in the 1.3 mm continuum with the SMA. They

detected two targets, one with a relatively high dust mass (NY Ori, 9×10−4 M⊙), and

one with much lower (V1118 Ori, 6×10−5 M⊙). The other two targets were undetected,

with 3 σ upper limits of 6×10−5 M⊙ for V1143 Ori and 6×10−6 M⊙ for VY Tau. Compared

to these, the dust disk mass of EX Lup is in the range of the least massive EXor disks

detected. Therefore, the prototype of the class ﬁts into the trend that EXors disks are

less massive than FUor disks. A possible cause for the low disk masses is binarity: there

is a trend that stars with companions within 100 au generally have lower disk masses

than single stars or wider binaries (Osterloh & Beckwith 1995; Andrews & Williams 2005).

Indeed, many EXors are binaries (e.g., VY Tau, V1118 Ori, or XZ Tau, see Leinert et al.

1993, Reipurth et al. 2007, Hartigan & Kenyon 2003). EX Lup have been searched for

companions with diﬀerent methods without conclusive results (see, e.g., K´osp´al et al. 2014

and references therein).

The low EXor disk masses raise the question what mechanism causes the eruption of

these disks and what reservoir can replenish the material in the inner disk after it lands

– 11 –

on the star. The low disk masses virtually exclude mechanisms related to gravitational

instability. A promising new idea was presented by D’Angelo & Spruit (2012), who

proposed that accretion onto a strongly magnetic protostar is inherently episodic if the disk

is truncated close to the corotation radius. D’Angelo & Spruit (2012) demonstrated that

this mechanism may work for EX Lup.
