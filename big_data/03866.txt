ABSTRACT

The star formation rates (SFRs) in weak emission line (WEL) galaxies in a volume-
limited (0.02 < z < 0.05) sample of blue early-type galaxies (ETGs) identiﬁed from
SDSS, are constrained here using 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. The direct de-
tection of 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission is made in 8 WEL galaxies and a median
stacking is performed on 57 WEL galaxies using VLA FIRST images. The median
stacked 1.4 GHz ﬂux density and luminosity are estimated as 79 ± 19 µJy and 0.20 ±
0.05 × 1021 W Hz−1 respectively. The radio far-infrared correlation in 4 WEL galaxies
suggests that the radio continuum emission from WEL galaxies is most likely due to
star formation activities. The median SFR for WEL galaxies is estimated as 0.23 ±
0.06 M(cid:12)yr−1, which is much less compared to SFRs (0.5 − 50 M(cid:12)yr−1) in purely star
forming blue ETGs. The SFRs in blue ETGs are found to be correlated with their
stellar velocity dispersions (σ) and decreasing gradually beyond σ of ∼ 100 km s−1.
This eﬀect is most likely linked with the growth of black hole and suppression of star
formation via AGN feedback. The color diﬀerences between SF and WEL sub-types of
blue ETGs appear to be driven to large extent by the level of current star formation
activities. In a likely scenario of an evolutionary sequence between sub-types, the ob-
served color distribution in blue ETGs can be explained best in terms of fast evolution
through AGN feedback.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early-type galaxies (ETGs) were once believed to be a sin-
gle type of objects passively evolving without any presence
of cold interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation. The
Inf rared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) detected for the
ﬁrst time a presence of cold ISM in the form of dust in ellip-
tical galaxies in the local Universe (Neugebauer et al. 1984;
Knapp et al. 1985, 1989). The cold ISM was subsequently de-
tected in several elliptical galaxies through HI observations
(van Gorkom et al. 1989; Huchtmeier et al. 1995). Sage &
Welch (2006) detected HI in a volume-limited sample of S0
galaxies. Morganti et al. (2006) detected HI along with radio
continuum in 12 S0 galaxies in which ionized gas in the cen-
ters was already known to exist. The molecular contents re-
sponsible for star formation in elliptical and S0 galaxies have
been detected through CO and OH observations of several
infrared bright elliptical galaxies (Wang et al. 1992; Wik-

lind et al. 1995; Knapp & Rupen 1996; Omar et al. 2002;
Combes et al. 2007). A sample of ETGs having star forma-
tion showed presence of ionized gas traced by Hα (Macchetto
et al. 1996). It is well established that ETGs belong to a
class of heterogeneous objects with varying physical condi-
tions and compositions in the ISM, and encompass a large
range in star formation rate (Bregman et al. 1992; Hogg
et al. 1993; Ferrari et al. 1999; Trager et al. 2000; Morganti
et al. 2006; Schawinski et al. 2007, 2009; Huang & Gu 2009;
McIntosh et al. 2014).

the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data has resulted
into detection of several ETGs in the nearby Universe with
a large scatter in their optical colors and emission line
strengths (Bernardi 2003; Fukugita et al. 2004; Schawinski
et al. 2007, 2014). A new class of ’blue’ ETG was inferred
based on their distinct u − r colors, signiﬁcantly bluer
than the classical red ETGs (Schawinski et al. 2009, 2014,
hereafter SCH09). The u − r colors of blue ETGs are in the
range of 1.3− 2.5, while red sequence galaxies normally have

colors between 2.5 − 3.0. The detection of several emission
lines typical of star forming regions and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in star forming ETGs established that there
is copious amount of cold and ionized ISM associated with
star formation as well as presence of AGN related activities
in these objects. (Morganti et al. 2006; Sarzi et al. 2006;
Schawinski et al. 2007, 2009, 2014).

The nature of optical emission lines from galaxies is
distinguished into star formation, AGN or composite using
the BPT (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich) diagram (Bald-
win et al. 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). In the SCH09
volume-limited sample having a total of 204 blue ETGs,
25% galaxies are classiﬁed as purely star forming (SF), 12%
are mainly AGN (Seyferts and low ionization emission line
regions – LINERs), 25% host both AGN and star forma-
tion, and rest (38%) show no or weak emission lines. The last
group of objects known as weak emission line (WEL) galax-
ies constitute a sample of 76 galaxies. Signiﬁcant patterns
were seen in color-mass diagram as well as in optical line
strengths in star-forming (SF), AGN+SF composite, AGN,
WEL sub-types of blue ETGs. Galaxies having strong emis-
sion lines indicative of star formation are the bluest in color
and signiﬁcantly oﬀ from the red sequence while WEL galax-
ies are located closer to the red sequence (Schawinski et al.
2007; Huang & Gu 2009). The colors of galaxies exhibit-
ing spectrum of AGN and AGN+SF composite are found
between these two extremes (Schawinski et al. 2014). This
observed pattern in average colors of diﬀerent types of ETGs
suggests some kind of evolutionary sequence within diﬀer-
ent sub-types of blue ETGs (Bell et al. 2004; Driver et al.
2006; Schawinski et al. 2007; Bamford et al. 2009; Huang &
Gu 2009; McIntosh et al. 2014; Schawinski et al. 2014). The
colors also indicate that WEL sub-type has some links with
the AGN activities.

Constraining star formation rate (SFR) in diﬀerent sub-
types of blue ETGs can be of signiﬁcant importance for
understanding evolution of ETGs. The SFR has been es-
timated for purely star forming blue ETGs in the range
0.5 − 50 M(cid:12)yr−1 using optical emission lines in SCH09. It
was not possible to constrain SFR in WEL galaxies using
the optical data since the detections of emission lines are
of low signal-to-noise ratio in WEL galaxies. Constraining
SFR in AGN+SF will be very challenging since contribu-
tion of AGN needs to be ﬁrst determined and removed. The
SFR in WEL galaxies can possibly be derived from the 1.4
GHz radio continuum emission if any residual AGN contri-
bution to the radio continuum emission is negligible. Given
the weakness of optical line strengths in WEL galaxies, the
SFR in these galaxies are expected to be signiﬁcantly less
than 1 M(cid:12)yr−1 (SCH09).

We searched for 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission in
WEL galaxies in the sample of SCH09 using the Faint Im-
ages of Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey images
taken with the Very large Array (VLA) (Becker et al. 1995).
We detected radio continuum emission in 8 WEL galaxies.
We used image-stacking technique to obtain limits on SFR
in 57 WEL galaxies. We detected signiﬁcant radio contin-
uum emission in the stacked image. This paper presents the
radio detection statistics and the SFR limits to the WEL
galaxies. This paper also makes a brief discussion on im-
plications of detection of radio continuum in blue ETGs on

2 SAMPLE PROPERTIES AND RADIO

DETECTION IN WEL GALAXIES

The blue early-type galaxy sample of SCH09 is a volume-
limited sample of 204 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.02−
0.05. This sample lists a total of 50 star forming (SF), 52
AGN+SF composite, 26 AGN, and 76 WEL galaxies. The
redshift distributions of WEL and SF galaxies are shown
in Figure 1. The 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission was
searched at the optical locations of all WEL galaxies using
the archived FIRST images (Becker et al. 1995). The FIRST
images were available only for 65 out of 76 WEL galaxies in
SCH09. A direct detection of radio continuum emission is
made in only eight WEL galaxies using the FIRST images.
Their properties and detection statistics are given in Table 1.
We then stacked the FIRST images of the regions centered at
the optical locations of the un-detected WEL galaxies. The
stacked image shown in Figure 2 is a median combination
of 57 FIRST images. The detection statistics in the stacked
image is listed in the last row of Table 1. The radio ﬂux
density at the center is estimated as 79 µJy with an rms of 19
µJy beam−1. The beam sizes in the individual images vary
between 5” − 6”. The median stacking was preferred over
mean stacking since median combination is less sensitive to
any chance appearance of highly deviating ﬂux value in an
individual image.

The stacking of the FIRST images has been used pre-
viously in making statistically signiﬁcant radio detections

in White et al. (2007). The detection based on image stack-

ing relies on improving signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of
N by stacking N images in absence of any signiﬁcant non-

19 µJy beam−1. This value is close to the expected

improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio in the FIRST im-
ages having typical rms of 0.15 mJy beam−1. Since any kind
of systematic noise in radio images can aﬀect the detection
statistics in the stacked image signiﬁcantly, we checked indi-
vidual images visually and through an analysis of their pixel
ﬂux distribution. The Figure 3 shows distribution of pixel
ﬂux values of 57 individual VLA FIRST images and the ﬁnal

Gaussian. This ﬁgure clearly indicates that the stacked im-
age is not aﬀected signiﬁcantly by any systematic noise or
pixel artifact. The detection made in the stacked image is
therefore reliable.

The radio luminosity is computed from the 1.4 GHz ﬂux

density using the relation given in Yun et al. (2001):

log L1.4GHz[W Hz

−1] = 20.08 + 2 log D + log S1.4GHz (1)

where D represents the distance in Mpc and S1.4GHz
represents the 1.4 GHz radio continuum ﬂux density in Jy.
Assuming a linear relationship between distance (D) and
redshift (z), the equation (1) can be written as:

S ∼

L

2 × 1027 z2

(2)

In a stacking of N images at diﬀerent redshifts, having
constant luminosity L, the above relation can be written as:

where zeq is the equivalent redshift for obtaining a lumi-

and the corresponding median 1.4 GHz radio luminosity for
WEL galaxies is estimated as 0.20 ± 0.05 × 1021 W Hz−1.
The radio luminosities of directly detected WEL galaxies are
in the range of 1 to 7 × 1021 W Hz−1.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The radio continuum emission in nearby galaxies has both
thermal and non-thermal components (Condon 1992). The
later being due to synchrotron emission tracing its origin ei-
ther in relativistic cosmic electrons accelerated in supernova
process indicative of star formation activities or in central
black hole related AGN activities. The thermal emission is
due to star formation activities, but, is relatively very week

compared to the synchrotron emission due to star forma-
tion activities (Condon 1992). The separation of two diﬀer-
ent synchrotron emissions (SF and AGN) can be diﬃcult.
In the SCH09 sample, galaxies are identiﬁed as AGN or SF
based on an analysis of optical emission lines. Since opti-
cal lines are of poor strengths in WEL galaxies, the nature
of WEL galaxies remained largely un-identiﬁed. Therefore,
it is important to identify nature of radio emission from
WEL galaxies from an independent analysis such as radio
far-infrared correlation (van der Kruit 1973; Condon 1992;
Yun et al. 2001), which can reveal any AGN related emission
as an excess to that expected from the star forming activities
alone. We searched for far-infrared (FIR) emission, another
indicator of star formation, in eight directly detected WEL
galaxies at 1.4 GHz radio continuum. The 1-D co-add IRAS
scans at source locations provided by the online IRAS scan
processing and integration tool (SCANPI) were used. The
peak ﬂux densities at 60µm and 100µm at source locations in
the noise weighted IRAS co-added scans are given in Table
1. Four out of eight WEL galaxies have signiﬁcant detec-
tions at 60µm and 100µm wavelengths. The ‘q’ parameter
as a ratio of the FIR luminosity and 1.4 GHz radio luminos-
ity (Yun et al. 2001) is also computed and given in Table
1. The ‘q’ parameter is a strong indicator of ongoing star
formation activities in galaxies if value of ‘q’ for a galaxy is
between 1.6 − 3.0, as evidenced from a study of large sam-
ple of star forming galaxies (Yun et al. 2001). If value of ‘q’
is signiﬁcantly below this range, it is normally taken as an
indicator of AGN related excess radio continuum emission
(e.g., Omar & Dwarakanath 2005). It can be seen that the
‘q’ values in 3 WEL galaxies are within the normal range for
a star forming galaxy and one WEL galaxy shows slightly
higher ‘q’ value. No WEL galaxy shows a radio excess in-
dicative of AGN related activities. Although our sample size
is very small, it can be safely assumed that WEL galaxies
do not have any signiﬁcant AGN activities and the 1.4 GHz
radio continuum emission is due to star formation activities.

The radio luminosity can be converted into SFR (M >

0.1 M(cid:12)) using the relation (Condon et al. 2002)

SFR [M(cid:12) yr

−1] = 1.2 × 10

−21 L1.4GHz[W Hz

−1]

(5)

This relationship assumes a Salpeter initial mass func-
tion between 0.1 − 100 M(cid:12). This relation is obtained af-
ter subtracting a thermal emission contribution to the total
emission at 1.4 GHz. The FIRST images have typical rms
of ∼ 0.15 mJy beam−1, which corresponds to 3σ detection
limit to SFR as 0.44 M(cid:12)yr−1 and 2.74 M(cid:12)yr−1 at the red-
shifts of 0.02 and 0.05 respectively. The SFRs for the directly
detected 8 WEL galaxies are in the range of 1 to 8 M(cid:12)yr−1.
The median SFR for the stacked WEL galaxies is estimated
as 0.23 ± 0.06 M(cid:12)yr−1. Salim et al. (2012) estimated SFR
as ∼ 0.5 M(cid:12)yr−1 in a sample of ETGs at z ∼ 0.1, in close
agreement with the median SFR derived here.

The ETGs have blue colors due to ongoing star for-
mation activities. The star forming galaxies showing strong
emission lines are the bluest in color with average u−r color
as 2.02 ± 0.02. The WEL galaxies are signiﬁcantly less blue
in color with average u − r color as 2.31 ± 0.01. The WEL
galaxies are located closer to the classical red sequence of
ETGs (Schawinski et al. 2007; Huang & Gu 2009). The av-
erage color of blue ETGs with AGN activities is 2.16 ± 0.02,
which is in between average colors of SF and WEL galaxies.
The SFRs of blue ETGs studied here are plotted against
their u − r colors in Figure 4. The estimated median SFR
for the WEL galaxies using stacking of the FIRST images
is also shown in this ﬁgure. It can be seen that SFR values
have large scatter with respect to the u − r color. Neverthe-
less, galaxies having high SFR appear to be bluer on average
than galaxies having low SFR. It can also be seen that the
median value of SFR in WEL galaxies is consistent with
their colors. The large scatter in SFR-color relation is most
likely due to several factors coming from uncertainties in the
past history of star formation episodes, dust content, metal
enrichment and SFR estimates.

The primary mechanism that regulates star formation
and color evolution in ETGs is still a matter of debate (Salim
et al. 2012; Schawinski et al. 2014). The stellar velocity dis-
persion in ETGs plays an important role in regulating star

largely independent of the optical luminosity (Schawinski
et al. 2006). The stellar velocity dispersion of blue ETGs of
SCH09 are plotted in Figure 5 for all sub-types (SF, AGN
host, WEL). It can be seen in this ﬁgure that there is no
appreciable diﬀerence between their sub-types in term of σ.
It can also be seen that blue ETGs are found mainly with
σ < 150 km s−1.

In order to understand a relationship between the stellar
velocity dispersion and star formation, SFR is plotted with
velocity dispersion in Figure 6 for all blue ETGs in SCH09
for which SFR estimates are available. The upper limits for
non-detections in WEL galaxies are also plotted here. It can
be seen from Figure 6 that SFR in blue ETGs are linearly
correlated with velocity dispersion up to nearly 100 km s−1.
At higher values of σ, SFR seems to be declining. It can be
seen that for log σ values between 2 and 2.2, signiﬁcantly
large fraction of galaxies shows less SFR compared to that
expected from a linear relationship expected from low σ val-
ues. A polynomial ﬁt to all data points as shown in Figure
6 further establishes that SFR in blue ETGs declines be-
yond a velocity dispersion of nearly 100 km s−1. The stellar
velocity dispersion in galaxies is known to have strong links
with the growth of black hole and triggering of AGNs, which
in turn are believed to be regulating star formation (Silk &
Rees 1998; Fabian 2012; Schawinski et al. 2006). The black
hole masses in centers of galaxies are found to be linearly
correlated with stellar velocity dispersion (Kormendy 1993;
Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998; Rich-
stone et al. 1998; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt
2000; van den Bosch et al. 2012; Savorgnan & Graham 2015).
It is believed that AGN related shocks and winds remove
the bulk of gas from galaxies thereby suppressing or halting
star formation. Several studies have pointed out role of AGN
feedback in regulating star formation in early-type galaxies
(Schawinski et al. 2007; Kaviraj et al. 2011; Schawinski et al.
2014; Kaviraj et al. 2015). A semi analytical study predicts
that galaxies having stellar velocity dispersion in the range
of 80 to 240 km s−1 can experience suppression of star for-
mation via the growth of black hole (Schawinski et al. 2006).
At higher velocity dispersion, the black hole merger domi-
nates and star formation is almost prohibited in such galax-
ies. Our results for blue ETGs presented in this paper are
in close agreement with these predictions. These results es-
tablishes that star formation in blue ETGs is predominantly
found in galaxies with low stellar velocity dispersion, and is
suppressed in galaxies with higher velocity dispersion. This
eﬀect may in turn be linked to AGN feedback process in
galaxies with high velocity dispersion.

In a study of 16,000 ETGs in the redshift range 0.05
- 0.1 taken from MOSES (Morphologically Selected Ellipti-
cals in SDSS) data, Schawinski et al. (2007) identiﬁed an
evolutionary sequence from SF to quiescence via AGN ac-
tivities based on color diﬀerences. They predicted based on
stellar evolution models that this transition process takes
place within about 1 Gyr. SCH09 examined this scenario
for the blue ETG sample. The color distribution of all blue
ETGs is shown in Figure 7 along with time required for
the color evolution based on two evolutionary models after
an episode of starburst – one assuming a passive evolution
without AGN feedback and other with strong AGN feed-
back. These models are taken from Kaviraj et al. (2011). It
can be seen here that the observed color distribution can be

formation. The stellar velocity dispersion (σ), indicative of
dynamical age and stellar mass, in blue ETGs is found to be
signiﬁcantly lower than the majority of red ETGs with simi-
lar luminosities (Schawinski et al. 2006, 2007, 2009; Huang &
Gu 2009; Jeong et al. 2009). This indicates that blue ETGs
are dynamically younger and less massive compared to their
red-sequence counterparts. It was also observed that fraction
of blue ETGs drops signiﬁcantly at the high end (∼ 200 km
s−1) of their stellar velocity dispersion distribution and is

km/s, and its limits to the scatter respectively. A polynomial ﬁt
(dot-dashed line) to all data points represents a possible trend of
SFR with σ.

well ﬁtted in terms of fast (∼ 1 Gyr) evolution through AGN
feedback process. In absence of AGN feedback, the passive
evolution will take very long time (> 5 Gyr) to explain the
observed color distribution. Based on this plot and the fact
that a good fraction of blue ETGs have AGN activities, a
causal relationship between AGN activities and star forma-
tion suppression can be inferred.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission is detected directly
in eight weak emission line galaxies with a radio luminosity
in the range of ∼ 1 to 7 × 1021 W Hz−1. Their SFRs are
in the range of 1 − 8 M(cid:12)yr−1. The statistically signiﬁcant
1.4 GHz radio continuum emission of 79 µJy with an rms of
19 µJy beam−1 is detected in a stacked image of 57 WEL
galaxies. The median radio luminosity and SFR in these
galaxies are estimated as 1.9 ± 0.5 × 1020 W Hz−1 and 0.23
± 0.06 M(cid:12)yr−1 respectively. The star formation rates in a
volume-limited sample of pure star forming blue ETGs was
known from earlier studies in the range of 0.5 − 50 M(cid:12)yr−1
based on strengths of optical emission lines from the SDSS.
It was not possible earlier to estimate SFR in WEL galaxies
due to weakness of optical line strengths in WEL galaxies.
Based on radio continuum detections, we predicted SFR in
majority of WEL galaxies at ∼ 0.2 M(cid:12)yr−1. The radio far-
infrared correlation was constructed in 4 WEL galaxies for
which both radio and far-infrared detections were available.
These galaxies follow the radio-FIR correlation without a
signiﬁcant deviation.

The SFRs in blue ETGs are found to be correlated with
their stellar velocity dispersion. It was also shown here that
average SFR in blue ETGs decreases gradually beyond σ
of ∼ 100 km s−1. This eﬀect is most likely linked with the
growth of black hole and suppression of star formation via
AGN feedback process. The color diﬀerences between SF and
WEL sub-types of blue ETGs appear to be driven to large
extent by the level of current star formation activities within
each sub-type. In the case of an evolutionary sequence be-
tween SF and WEL galaxies, the observed color distribution
in blue ETGs can be explained best in terms of fast (∼ 1
Gyr) evolution through AGN feedback process.
