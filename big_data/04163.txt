Abstract—In this work, with combined belief propagation
(BP), mean ﬁeld (MF) and expectation propagation (EP), an
iterative receiver is designed for joint phase noise (PN) estimation,
equalization and decoding in a coded communication system. The
presence of the PN results in a nonlinear observation model.
Conventionally, the nonlinear model
is directly linearized by
using the ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation, e.g., in the state-of-
the-art soft-input extended Kalman smoothing approach (soft-in
EKS). In this work, MF is used to handle the factor due to the
nonlinear model, and a second-order Taylor approximation is
used to achieve Gaussian approximation to the MF messages,
which is crucial to the low-complexity implementation of the
receiver with BP and EP. It turns out that our approximation
is more effective than the direct linearization in the soft-in
EKS with similar complexity, leading to signiﬁcant performance
improvement as demonstrated by simulation results.

I. INTRODUCTION

L OCAL oscillators, which provide a reference signal for

time and frequency synchronization, are one of the key
modules in a communication system. The instability of oscil-
lators results in phase noise (PN), which may severely affect
the system performance [1].

Various Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches have been
proposed to solve the PN problem. Bhatti et al. modelled the
PN with a discrete cosine transform (DCT) expansion [2],
where the DCT coefﬁcients can be easily estimated. How-
ever, the DCT method is a non-Bayesian one, and it does
not make use of the time dependence of the PN process.
In Bayesian methods such as particle ﬁlter [3], Tikhonov
parametric estimation [4], and extended Kalman smoothing
(EKS) [5], PN is modelled as a Wiener process. The particle
ﬁltering method [3] needs to sample the posteriori probability
density function (PDF) of continuous-valued PN variables,
where a larger number of particles yields better performance at

the cost of higher complexity. The Tikhonov parametrization
method [4] (or called a von Mises distribution [6]) is an
iterative method to deal with the presence of strong PN for
AWGN channels. The intractable integral operation associated
with continuous variables is circumvented by constraining the
PDF to Tikhonov distribution. However, the work in [4] was
focused on AWGN channel, and a straightforward extension
to the inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel which is allowed
by incorporating a MAP equalizer will lead to complexity
growing exponentially with the channel memory length. In
the soft input EKS (Soft-in EKS) method1 proposed in [5],
the nonlinear observation model is directly linearized by using
the ﬁrst order Taylor expansion. Soft-in EKS has been used in
single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) systems [5], [8]–[10].

Recently, the message passing techniques, such as belief
propagation (BP) [11] and variational message passing (VMP)
[12], have been widely used for iterative receivers design. BP
is effective for discrete probability models and linear Gaussian
models. A BP-based equalizer proposed in [13] has a linear
complexity, which is much lower than that of the equalizer
in [14]. The VMP method, also referred as mean ﬁled (MF),
is especially suitable for handling variables with exponential
distributions. Recently, a uniﬁed message passing framework
was proposed in [15], where BP and MF are merged to keep
the virtues of BP and MF while avoid their drawbacks. It
has been applied to joint channel estimation and decoding in
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system
[16], [17] and single carrier frequency domain equalization
(SC-FDE) system [18]. In addition, expectation propagation
(EP) [19] has been used to achieve Gaussian approximation
to non-Gaussian messages, and combined EP and BP has been
applied to ﬂat-fading or ISI channel equalization, e. g., in [7],
[20] .

In this paper, with combined BP, MF and EP, we propose
an iterative approach to joint PN estimation, equalization and
decoding for a coded system over ISI channels. BP and EP
are used to deal with the linear model for PN process and
modulation and coding, while MF is used to handle the factor
due to the nonlinear observation model. Furthermore, the non-
Gaussian MF messages are approximated to be Gaussian by
using the second-order Taylor expansion, which enables low-
complexity implementation of the receiver with BP and EP.
Our approximation is more effective than the direct lineariza-
tion of the nonlinear model in the soft-in EKS [5], which

extended to the case of ISI channels, e.g., by incorporating the BP-EP
algorithm [7] to handle ISI channels.

proposed approach in terms of mean-square-error (MSE) of
PN estimation and system bit-error-rate (BER) performance.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND FACTOR GRAPH

REPRESENTATION

We consider a coded communication system. An informa-
tion bit sequence b = [b0, ..., bNb−1]T is encoded and inter-
leaved, yielding an interleaved codeword c = [c0, ..., cNc−1]T.
Then sequence c is mapped to a symbol sequence x =
[x0, ..., xM−1]T which is transmitted over an ISI channel with
coefﬁcients h = [hL−1, ..., h0]T. The channel coefﬁcients
are assumed to be constant during each transmitted block
and they are available to the receiver. By considering the
effect of PN, the received baseband signal at time instant k,
(k = 0, 1, ..., M + L − 2), can be represented as [21]

yk = ejθk

hlxk−l + nk = ejθk hTsk + nk

(1)

where sk (cid:44) [xk−L+1, ..., xk]T with xk = 0 for k < 0 and
k > M − 1, and nk is a sample of the complex Gaussian
n. The phase θk represents the PN at
noise with variance σ2
time instant k, and the PN can be modelled as a random-walk
(Wiener) process [4], [5]

III. ITERATIVE RECEIVER DESIGN WITH BP-MF-EP
Due to the presence of PN, the observation model in (1) is
nonlinear. In EKS, the nonlinear model is directly linearized
with the ﬁrst order Taylor approximation. The nonlinear model
is represented by the factors {fyk ,∀k} in Fig. 1. In this work,
we use MF to handle the factors.
As shown in Fig. 1, we partition the graph into three parts:
BP-EP subgraph, MF subgraph and BP subgraph. Accordingly,

the factor nodes are classiﬁed into three disjoint sets: ABP-EP (cid:44)
{fsk , fX;∀k}, AMF (cid:44) {fyk ;∀k} and ABP (cid:44) {fθk ;∀k} with
ABP = ∅. In the following, we detail the
ABP-EP
messages updating in each subgraph.

p(θk|θk−1) = N (θk; θk−1, σ2

the deterministic relationship between sk, sk−1 and xk which
is given by sk = Gsk−1 + exk, where the L × L matrix
G = [0 I L−1; 0 0T], the length-L vector e = [0T 1]T, and 0
is a zero column vector with length L − 1.
A factor graph representation of (3) is shown in Fig. 1,
which will be employed to develop a combined BP-MF-EP

As shown in Fig. 1, message passing for PN estimation
operates in the BP subgraph, where we need to calculate the
forward and backward messages and the outgoing messages
which are input to the MF subgraph.

We assume that

the incoming messages from the MF
subgraph are available, and they are Gaussian, i.e., we have
{mfyk→θk (θk) ∝ N (θk; ˆθ↓k, σ2
),∀k}. The details on the
θ↓k
calculations of the incoming messages are delayed to Section
III-C. It is worth mentioning that, with the incoming Gaus-
sian messages, all the messages running in the subgraph are
Gaussian.

as

B. Message Passing in BP-EP Subgraph

We assume that

the incoming messages from the MF
subgraph are available, and they are Gaussian. The calculations
of the incoming messages will be detailed in Section III-C.
So this subgraph involves the incoming Gaussian messages
from the MF subgraph and discrete binary messages from
the decoder. For this subgraph, we simply borrow the BP-
EP algorithm developed in [7] where the use of EP produces
Gaussian messages for xk, which will in turn lead to Gaussian
output messages in the BP-EP subgraph. We refer readers to
[7] for the details of the BP-EP algorithm.

mfsk→sk (sk) ∝ CN (sk; ˆs→k , Σs→k

With the BP-EP algorithm, we can calculate the messages

sk denoted by b(sk), which are Gaussian again and can be
expressed as

C. Message Passing in the MF Subgraph

As shown by the middle part of the graph in Fig. 1, the
MF subgraph consists of the observation factors fyk. We need
to compute the outgoing messages to the BP-EP subgraph
(BP subgraph) based on the incoming messages from the BP
subgraph (BP-EP subgraph).

Assume that the incoming message b(sk) from the BP-EP
subgraph is available. According to the rules [15] the outgoing
messages to the BP subgraph can be computed as

mfyk→θk (θk) ∝ exp

log(fyk (θk, sk))b(sk)dsk

(cid:26)(cid:90)

where rk (cid:44) 2σ−2

vector of the Gaussian belief b(sk). Note that the message
mfyk→θk (θk) yielded in (11) is no longer Gaussian. However,
Gaussian messages are expected for the BP subgraph for PN
estimation, which is crucial to its low complexity implementa-
tion. To achieve this, we use the second-order Taylor expansion
of (cid:60)[rkejθk ] at the estimate of θk, i.e.,

It is noted that the Soft-in-EKS algorithm [5] uses the
ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion to locally linearize model (1)
directly. In contrast, we use the second order Taylor series
to approximate the MF message mfyk→θk (θk). It turns out
that the performance of our algorithm is much better than that
of the Soft-in-EKS algorithm, as demonstrated by simulation
results.

Similarly, we also apply MF message update rules to the
computation of the outgoing message mfyk→sk (sk) for the
BP-EP subgraph

mfyk→sk (sk) = exp

An approximation to the term (cid:104)e−jθk(cid:105)b(θk) in (17) can be
obtained by exploiting the second-order Taylor expansion, and
it can be calculated as (cid:104)e−jθk(cid:105)b(θk) ≈ e−j ˆθk (1 − 0.5σ2

The overall message passing schedule for joint PN estima-
tion, equalization and decoding is summarized in Algorithm 1.

E. Complexity Analysis

Note that the BP-EP algorithm in [7] is incorporated in
both the Soft-in EKS method and the proposed BP-MF-EP
method to handle ISI channels. Hence, both methods involve
the computation of (8), which requires a complexity of O(L3).
We can also see that PN estimation in both the Soft-in EKS
method and the BP-MF-EP method (i.e., the computation of
(12) and the message passing in the BP subgraph shown in
Fig.1) have similar complexity, which is in the order of L.
From the above analysis, the BP-MF-EP method and the Soft-
in EKS method have similar complexity.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
method and compare it with the Soft-in EKS method (where
the BP-EP algorithm in [7] is incorporated to handle ISI
channels) in terms of MSE for PN estimation and BER for
the system performance. The system settings are as follows.
The length of symbols in each frame is 1024. A rate-1/2
nonsystematic convolutional code with generator (23, 35)8 is
used to encode the bits sequence, and the coded sequence
is permuted with a pseudo random interleaver. QPSK with
Gray mapping is used. In simulations, the phase noise is
generated using a Wiener process (2) with innovation variance
∆ = 1 × 10−4 and the Proakis-C channel with coefﬁcients
σ2
h = [0.227, 0.460, 0.668, 0.460, 0.227]T is used to examine
the performance of the receiver. As in [?], 5 pilot symbols
are inserted every 256 symbols to make the iterative process
bootstrap.

We compare the MSE performance of the proposed al-
gorithm with that of the Soft-in EKS algorithm for PN
estimation. The results with different number of iterations are
shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the proposed BP-MF-EP
method signiﬁcantly outperforms the Soft-in EKS method.

The comparisons of system BER performance are shown in
Fig. 3, where the performance with known PN is also included
for reference. It can be seen that considerable performance
gains can be achieved by the proposed BP-MF-EP method
compared to the Soft-in EKS method.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have proposed an iterative receiver for joint
PN estimation, equalization and decoding based on combined
BP, MF and EP. In particular, MF is used to tackle the factors
due to the nonlinear observation model and the second-order
Taylor expansion is used to achieve Gaussian approximation
to the MF messages, which is crucial to the low complexity
implementation of the receiver. The approximation is more
effective than the direct local linearization of the observation
model in the Soft-in EKS. As shown by the simulation results,
the proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms the Soft-in
EKS with similar complexity.
