We show how the use of entanglement can enhance the precision of the detection of the Unruh eﬀect with
an accelerated probe. We use the Unruh-DeWitt model of a two-level atom interacting relativistically with
a quantum ﬁeld and treat the atom as an open quantum system to derive the master equation governing its
evolution. By means of quantum state discrimination, we detect the accelerated motion of the atom by examining
its time evolving state. It turns out that the optimal strategy for the detection of the Unruh eﬀect, to which the
accelerated atom is sensitive, involves letting the atom-thermometer equilibrate with the thermal bath. However,
introducing initial entanglement between the detector and an external degree of freedom leads to an enhancement
of the sensitivity of the detector. Also, the maximum precision is attained within ﬁnite time, before equilibration
takes place.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum ﬁeld theory predicts that a relativistically acceler-
ated observer views the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath
with a temperature proportional to the proper acceleration of
the observer. This phenomenon, known as the Unruh eﬀect
[1], is extremely weak, and even the acceleration as high as
a ∼ 1021 m
s2 should result in the temperature as low as 1K.
Although several experimental proposals have been put forth
[2–14], veriﬁcation of the Unruh eﬀect still remains an open
question [15–17].

The theory of the Unruh eﬀect has attracted widespread in-
terest in the physics community and it has been extensively
examined from diﬀerent perspectives. These include the ap-
proaches involving Bogolyubov transformation between the
Minkowski and Rindler frames of reference [1, 15, 18–21],
the application of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model which of-
fers an operational deﬁnition of a particle as a trigger for the
transitions between the atomic energy levels [1, 22], the man-
ifestation of thermalization of open quantum systems involv-
ing decoherence and dissipation [23], and the thermal correc-
tion to the energy shift and spontaneous excitation of atoms
[24–26].
In recent years, the Unruh eﬀect has been exten-
sively considered in the ﬁeld of quantum information. It has
been studied how the Unruh eﬀect aﬀects quantum entangle-
ment between diﬀerent observers [18–21, 27–35], as well as
other types of non-classical correlations [20, 36–42] and con-
sequently quantum nonlocality [43–46], quantum teleporta-
tion [27, 47], entropic uncertainty relations [48], and param-
eter estimation [49–51]. The Unruh eﬀect has also been used

†Electronic address: jljing@hunn.edu.cn
‡Electronic address: dragan@fuw.edu.pl

to analyze how to improve information processing protocols
[52, 53] and quantum measurement techniques [54].

In order to detect the Unruh eﬀect several metrological
tools have been employed. Diﬀerent approaches include us-
ing Gaussian probes [55], applying the framework of open
quantum systems to compute Fisher information and quantum
Fisher information [56], and using the technique of quantum
channel discrimination [57].

In this work, we study an overlooked possibility of increas-
ing the detection precision for the Unruh eﬀect and show
how entangled states can be used to enhance sensibility of
the accelerated detectors. We use quantum state discrimina-
tion technique [58] to search for the optimal strategies that
can facilitate the detection of the Unruh eﬀect. We employ
the model of a two-level atom coupled to the massless scalar
ﬁelds in the Minkowski vacuum state as a probe and study its
time evolving state to discriminate between two possible sce-
narios: one, in which the atom has been inertial, and the other,
in which the atom has been uniformly accelerated. We discuss
diﬀerent strategies of detection and show how initial entangle-
ment between the atom and an external degree of freedom can
enhance the performance of the atom as a thermometer.

Our paper is constructed as follows: in section II we intro-
duce the model of our probe, we analyze the optimal detection
of the Unruh eﬀect in section III, and section IV concludes the
paper.

II. DETECTION MODEL

Consider a combined system of a detector and an external
ﬂuctuating vacuum ﬁeld with the total Hamiltonian of the gen-
eral form:

H = HD + HΦ + HI,

(1)

where HD is the Hamiltonian of the detector, HΦ is the free
Hamiltonian of the scalar ﬁeld, and HI represents their mutual
interaction. In this work we use the Unruh-DeWitt model of
the dynamics [22] of the system, so that the detector will be
described with a two-level atom governed by the Hamiltonian
HD = 1
2 ω0σz, where ω0 is its energy-level spacing and σz is
the Pauli matrix. The interaction Hamiltonian takes the form:

HI = µ(σ+ + σ−)Φ(x(τ)),

(2)

where µ is the coupling constant, σ+ (σ−) is the atomic raising
(lowering) operator, and Φ(x) corresponds to the scalar ﬁeld
operator taken at x(τ) representing the classical trajectory of
the atom.

We assume that the initial state of the atom, ρ(0), is separa-
ble from the initial state of the ﬁeld, which is assumed to be in
the Minkowski vacuum |0iM. Therefore the initial state of the
total system is given by ρtot = ρ(0) ⊗ |0iMh0|. In the reference
frame of the atom, the equation of motion of the total system
is given by:

dρtot(τ)

dτ

= −i[H, ρtot(τ)],

(3)

where τ is the proper time along the trajectory of the atom, and
ρtot(τ) denotes the time-dependent density matrix of the atom
and the ﬁeld. Generally, we will be interested in the evolution
of the atom and this dynamics can be obtained by tracing out
the ﬁeld degrees of freedom, i.e., ρ(τ) = TrΦ[ρtot(τ)]. The re-
duced state density of the atom, in the limit of weak coupling,
is found to obey the Kossakowski-Lindblad equation of the
form [23, 59]:

dρ(τ)

dτ

= −i[He f f , ρ(τ)] + L[ρ(τ)]

(4)

ρ(τ) =   e−4Aτ cos2 θ

with the eﬀective Hamiltonian He f f given below, and the
Lindblad superoperator:

L[ρ(τ)] =

Xi, j=1

ai j[2σ jρσi − σiσ jρ − ρσiσ j].

(5)

Both the matrix ai j and the eﬀective Hamiltonian He f f are
associated with the ﬁeld correlation functions, G+(x − x′) =
µ2h0|Φ(x)Φ(x′)|0i. By deﬁning the Fourier and Hilbert trans-
forms of the ﬁeld correlation functions, namely:

G(λ) = Z ∞

K(λ) =

(6)

(7)

we have computed that the coeﬃcients of the Kossakowski
matrix ai j can be expressed as:

ai j = Aδi j − iBǫi jkδk3 − Aδi3δ j3,

(8)
4 [G(ω0)+G(−ω0)], B = 1
with A = 1
4 [G(ω0)−G(−ω0)]. The ef-
fective Hamiltonian He f f , which contains the so called Lamb
shift [60], then can be written as:

He f f =

Ωσz =

2

[K(−ω0) − K(ω0)](cid:27) σz,

(9)

where we have deﬁned a renormalized energy level spacing
Ω, which contains the original atomic energy level spacing
ω0 and the energy shift i
2 [K(−ω0) − K(ω0)]. Assuming the
atom is initially prepared in the pure state |ψ(0)i = sin θ
2|0i +
cos θ
2|1i, by solving the master equation (4) we can obtain the
time-dependent reduced density matrix of the atom,

2 e−2Aτ−iΩτ sin θ
2 − B−A

2A (e−4Aτ − 1) ! .

1 − e−4Aτ cos2 θ

(10)

Let us now consider the evolution of the uniformly acceler-

ated two-level atom, whose trajectory can be described as:

obtain the ﬁeld correlation function in the frame of the accel-
erated atom [22]:

t(τ) =

1
a

sinh(aτ), x(τ) =

1
a

cosh(aτ), y(τ) = z(τ) = 0. (11)

In order to obtain the parameters of the reduced density matrix
of the accelerated atom, we need to evaluate the correlation
function of the ﬁeld, which can be found from the following
two-point function of the massless scalar ﬁeld:

G+(x, x′) = −

a2µ2

16π2 sinh−2(cid:20) a(τ − τ′)

2

− iǫ(cid:21).

(13)

In this case, the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld correlation func-
tion (6) is:

G(λ) =

µ2λ

4π (cid:18)1 + coth

πλ

a (cid:19).

(14)

Consequently, the coeﬃcients of the Kossakowski matrix ai j
and the eﬀective level spacing Ω of the atom are given by:

(12)

G+(x, x′) = −

Substituting the trajectory of the atom (11) into (12), one can

where γ0 = µ2ω0/2π is the spontaneous emission rate of the
inertial atom in Minkowski spacetime. Using the above results
and assuming that the time of evolution is suﬃciently long,
i.e. τ ≫ 1/A, one can write the steady state of the accelerated
atom as:

ρ(∞) =

eβ HD

T r[eβ HD]

,

(16)

which is a thermal state with the temperature T = 1/β = a/2π.
This result shows that the accelerated atom has been equili-
brating with the thermal bath characterized by the mean num-
ber of Unruh particles equal to NU = 1/(e
T − 1). For further
convenience, let us parameterize the number of Unruh parti-
cles by n = 1+2NU. Then, in the interaction representation we
can rewrite the time-dependent state of the accelerated atom
as:

(1 − e−γ0 nτ),

(17)

where r1(0) = sin θ, r2(0) = 0 and r3(0) = cos θ. Let us
note that if n = 1, then Eq. (17) represents the the evolving
quantum state of the inertial atom in the Minkowski vacuum.

III. OPTIMALLY DETECTING THE UNRUH EFFECT

We will now use the Unruh-DeWitt model described in the
previous section to act as a thermometer detecting the Unruh
eﬀect. In order to ﬁnd out how to optimally detect this eﬀect,
we choose to measure the atom in the basis that has the low-
est probability of misidentifying the two possible states: one
characterizing a static, and the other - uniformly accelerated
trajectory of the atom. It is clear that this question has been
reduced to the classical problem of quantum state discrimina-
tion [58]. In this scheme, the minimum probability of making
an error in the identiﬁcation of the states ρ1 or ρ2 is given by:

PE =

1
2

(1 −

2||ρ1 − ρ2||),

(18)

3

where ||∆|| = T r √∆†∆ denotes the trace norm of ∆. For Her-

mitian operators ∆ their norms also equal the sum of the ab-
solute values of their eigenvalues. In our problem, ρ1 is the
evolution state of the inertial atom, i.e., the case of n = 1 in
Eq. (17), and ρ2 corresponds to the quantum state of the ac-
celerated atom, i.e., the case of n > 1 in Eq. (17). From this,
we obtain:

PE =

(20)

2 γ0τ−e− 1

where Λ1 = e− 1
2 γ0nτ, Λ2 = e−γ0τ−e−γ0nτ, and Λ3 = (1−
e−γ0τ)− 1
n (1−e−γ0nτ). For suﬃciently long interaction times, the
atom reaches equilibrium with the state of the external ﬁeld,
then the distinguishability between the two equilibrium states
in Eq. (20) is determined by ∆∞ = 1 − n−1. Moreover, in the
long limit of interaction times the level of distinguishability is
independent of the initial state of such a thermometer.

Let us now study the distinguishability of the state for ﬁ-
nite interaction times. To better quantify the performance of
the atom thermometer, let us normalize the Euclidean distance
∆(~r1(τ)−~r2(τ)) to ∆∞. In Fig. 1, we plot ∆(~r1(τ)−~r2(τ))/∆∞ as
a function of the interaction time τ and the parameter θ char-
acterizing the initial state of the atom thermometer. We can
see from Fig. 1 that the two possible trajectories are always
less distinguishable as compared to the equilibrium case. The
largest distance between the two alternative ﬁnal states is ob-
tained in the limit of long interaction times, and it is equal to
1 − n−1. Interestingly the largest distance in this case is in-
dependent of initial states of the atom thermometer. It means
that the optimal condition to detect the Unruh eﬀect is letting
the atom evolve for long enough times regardless of its initial
state. Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that quantum coher-
ence [61] plays a trivial role in the optimal detection of the
Unruh eﬀect. Let us note that our results obtained here are
consistent with that of Ref. [56] where the technique of quan-
tum metrology has been used.

We also ﬁnd that if the probe is prepared in the excited state,
i.e., θ = 0, then there is a ﬁnite time, τ ≈ 0.80 (namely, when
Λ2 = Λ3), at which the trace distance goes to zero. This is
because at this time, both the accelerated atom and the in-
ertial atom are approximatively driven to the same thermal
state with the temperature T = 10. However, after that time,
the state of the accelerated atom remains almost unchanged,
while the state of the inertial atom will be eventually driven to
the ground state. Thus, we can see that the Euclidean distance
between these two cases will increase again and ﬁnally reach
1 − n−1. We can also see from Fig. 1 that the increase of θ
leads to a quicker equilibration of the system.

We will now turn our attention to a more general scenario,
in which the considered atom is initially entangled with an-
other atom that remains separated from its environment and
does not move. In particular we assume that the additional
atom does not interact with the external ﬁeld. Let us consider
the initial state of the two atoms to be:

Consider the Werner initial state,

where c±(0) = c1(0) ± c2(0). Let us note that in the limit of

1 − n−1 regardless of the initial state of the two atoms.
for which c1(0) =
−c2(0) = c3(0) = c with 0 ≤ c ≤ 1. Such an input state
is only entangled when 1/3 < c ≤ 1. The resulting trace
distance given by Eq. (23) is plotted in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that
the trace distance between the accelerated and non-accelerated
scenario increases as a function of the initial entanglement
(quantiﬁed by c). Besides, for some entangled states there is a
global maximum in the distinguishability before they achieve
the equilibrium with the environment, and interestingly this
value can even exceed the equilibrium value, 1 − n−1. This in-
teresting result proves that the performance of the thermome-
ter with the auxiliary component can be enhanced with the aid
of the initial entanglement. It also follows that the optimal bi-
partite state for the detection of Unruh eﬀect is the maximally
entangled state (c = 1).

Let us now elucidate some of the phenomena observed
in Fig. 2. There is a sudden change point for the trace
distance, which occurs when cΛ2 = Λ3. Thus, the big-

IV. CONCLUSIONS

5

We have used a simple model of a two-level atom interact-
ing relativistically with the ﬂuctuating massless scalar quan-
tum ﬁeld in the Minkowski vacuum to probe the Unruh eﬀect.
The purpose of the study was to determine the optimum meth-
ods of the detection, in particular to show a relevant role of the
initial entanglement, which has been overlooked in the previ-
ous studies. Within the framework of open quantum systems,
we have obtained the analytical dynamical evolution of the
thermometer. We have then compared the evolution of the ac-
celerated atom with that of the inertial one using the quantum
state discrimination techniques. We have found that regard-
less of the initial state of the atom, the largest trace distance
between this two cases is 1−n−1, which is achieved in the limit
of inﬁnitely long interaction times. This results corresponds to
the situation when the probe equilibrates with the surrounding
thermal bath of the ﬁeld. However, we have shown that this
result can be improved by considering a more general situa-
tion in which the atom thermometer is initially entangled with
another two-level system that does not interact with the con-
sidered ﬁeld. Our results shows that the elusive Unruh eﬀect,
which has been too diﬃcult to be experimentally veriﬁed so
far, perhaps can be better explored with the aid of entangled
systems in accelerated motion.

Let us note that our method here, based the equivalence
principle, can also be applied to the detection of Hawking ef-
fect [62] and Gibbons-Hawking eﬀect [63], and so on. Be-
sides, with the development of simulation experiments of rel-
ativistic quantum systems [12, 64], our results can be relevant
to upcoming experimental tests of related phenomena in ana-
logue systems.
