Transition-metal-based Heusler semiconductors are promising materials for a variety of applica-
tions ranging from spintronics to thermoelectricity. Employing the GW approximation within the
framework of the FLAPW method, we study the quasi-particle band structure of a number of such
compounds being almost gapless semiconductors. We ﬁnd that in contrast to the sp-electron based
semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, in these systems the many-body corrections have a minimal
eﬀect on the electronic band structure and the energy band gap increases by less than 0.2 eV, which
makes the starting point density functional theory (DFT) a good approximation for the description
of electronic and optical properties of these materials. Furthermore, the band gap can be tuned
either by the variation of the lattice parameter or by the substitution of the sp-chemical element.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Gapless materials have been attracting remarkable at-
tention after the discovery of graphene1 and topological
insulators2 for applications in thermoelectricity, nano-
electronics, spintronics, and optics, due to their high-
mobility, robust transport and physical properties.3,4
They may have either a quadratic energy dispersion
like Hg1−xCdxTe and Hg1−xMnxTe or a linear energy
dispersion like graphene and organic salt α−(BEDT-
TTF)2I3. Materials with linear dispersion obey the rel-
ativistic Dirac equation, and thus have very high carrier
mobilities. In gapless materials the charge carriers can
easily be excited from the valence band to the conduction
band without a cost of energy. Furthermore, one can eas-
ily change their band structure by external perturbations
like pressure, temperature, chemical composition, elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds. These innate properties make
them desirable for multifunctional tasks. For example,
electrons and holes can be fully spin-polarized simulta-
neously allowing tuneable spin transport in spin-gapless
semiconductors (SGSs),5 which make them ideal spin in-
jectors in spintronics devices.

Transition-metal

(TM)-based gapless or almost-
gapless semiconductors crystallizing in half and full
Heusler structure display rich physics ranging from
semimetallic and topological insulator phases to heavy
fermionic behavior.6 For example, speciﬁc heat measure-
ments of Heusler-type Fe2VAl showed that it is a can-
didate 3d heavy-fermion system.7 Indeed, Guo et al.8
concluded via ﬁrst-principles calculations that Fe2VAl is
a nonmagnetic semimetal with a narrow pseudogap at
the Fermi level. On the other hand, narrow band-gap
semiconductors in half Heusler structure XNiSn (X =
Ti, Zr, Hf) and CoTiSb are promising materials for high-
temperature thermoelectric applications with a high ﬁg-
ure of merit.9–11

Widely-spread standard ﬁrst-principles calculations
addressing the electronic and optical properties of solid
compounds including also the TM-based gapless and
almost-gapless (also known as zero or small band-gap,
respectively) semiconductors (SCs) are based on density-
functional theory (DFT) within either the local den-
sity approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradi-
ent approximation (GGA) to the exchange correlation
functional.8,12–14 As it is known, DFT is restricted to
the calculation of ground state properties, and fails in
describing the band gap and properties that rely on ex-
cited states. The deﬁciency of DFT for materials from
weak to intermediate correlations can be healed by the
GW approximation, which is shown to be quite success-
ful in describing the excited states, i.e., the band gaps
and optical properties.15

The aim of the present work is a systematic study of
the electronic structure of the TM-based SCs [(XX′)YZ,
where X, X′, and Y are transition metal elements, and Z
is an sp element] with almost zero band gaps. Due to the
presence of the TMs with narrow d -bands the correlation
eﬀects are expected to play a dominant role in electronic
structure of these materials. Using the GW approxima-
tion within the framework of the full potential linearized
augmented planewave (FLAPW) method, we show that
in contrast to sp-electron based SCs such as Si and GaAs,
in these systems the many-body correlations have a min-
imal eﬀect on the electronic band structure. We ﬁnd that
for many compounds the change of the band gap is less
than 0.2 eV, which makes the starting point DFT-LDA
(DFT-GGA)) a good approximation for the description
of electronic and optical properties of these materials.
Moreover, it is demonstrated that the band gap can be
tuned either by the substitution of the Z element or by a
variation of the lattice parameter. The rest of the paper
is organized as follows. In Section II we brieﬂy describe
the computational scheme. Section III presents the com-
putational results and discussion. In Section IV we give

the conclusions.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

The ground-state calculations are carried out using the
FLAPW method as implemented in the FLEUR code16
within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
of the exchange-correlation potential as parameterized
by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE).17 For all cal-
culations we use angular momentum and plane-wave
cutoﬀ parameters of lmax = 8 inside the spheres and
kmax = 4 bohr−1 for the outside region. The DFT-
PBE calculations are performed using a 16 × 16 × 16
k-point grid. In order to accurately describe the unoccu-
pied states we use local orbitals. Note that in the case of
(CoCr)TiBi local orbitals are also used for semi-core 5d
states of bismuth.

We performed the one-shot GW calculations using the
Spex code.18 In the one-shot GW approach oﬀ-diagonal
elements in the self-energy operator Σσ (Enkσ) are ig-
nored and corresponding expectation values of the local
exchange-correlation potential, V XC
, are subtracted in
order to prevent double counting. Within this frame-
work, the Kohn-Sham (KS) single-particle wavefunctions
ϕKS
nkσ are taken as approximations to the quasiparticle
(QP) wavefunctions. Hence, the QP energies Enkσ are
calculated as a ﬁrst order perturbation correction to the
KS values EKS

where n, k, and σ are band index, Bloch vector, and
electron spin, respectively.

The dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W is
expanded in the mixed product basis set having contri-
butions from the local atom-centered muﬃn-tin spheres,
and plane waves in the interstitial region.20 For mixed
product basis set we used the cutoﬀ parameters Lmax = 4
and Gmax = 3 Bohr−1. For each compound three diﬀer-
ent k-point grids are used to sample the full Brillouin
zone: 4 × 4 × 4, 6 × 6 × 6, and 8 × 8 × 8. The relativis-
tic corrections are treated at the scalar-relativistic level
(no spin-orbit coupling) for valence states, while the full
Dirac equation is employed for the core states. We have
converged the excited energies with the number of un-
occupied states and observed that with 300 bands the
band gap is converged to within less than 10 meV for all
compounds under study.

The considered TM-based SCs crystallize in the
LiMgPdSn-type crystal structure with the space group
of F¯43m. They are made up of four interpenetrating
face-centered cubic (fcc) lattices. The crystal structure
is described by the chemical formula (XX′)YZ, where X,
X′, and Y are TMs, and Z is an sp-element. The atoms
are placed at four equidistant sites on the diagonal of the
fcc lattice in sequence of X-Y-X′-Z. Valence of the TMs
follows the same order as in their chemical formula, i.e.,

X atoms have the highest valence, while Y atoms have
the lowest.

To identify TM-based gapless or almost-gapless SCs,
gaps we use the well-known Slater-Pauling (SP) rule21,22
which relates the total spin magnetic moment per unit
cell in µB (Mt) of compounds to their total number of va-
lence electrons (Nv). For the LiMnPdSn-type quaternary
compounds, the SP rule takes the form Mt = Nv − 24,23
and thus potential zero-gap SCs should have 24 valence
electrons per formula unit. We have chosen as candidates
the (FeMn)TiP, (CoMn)TiSi, (CoMn)VAl, (CoFe)TiAl,
(CoCr)TiP, (CoCr)TiAs, (CoCr)TiSb, and (CoCr)TiSb
compounds. Since Nv =24, the SP rule states that their
total spin magnetic moment should be zero.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. DFT results

We begin our discussion with the results obtained from
the standard GGA formalism of DFT. Since the com-
pounds under study do not exist experimentally, we have
ﬁrst determined the equilibrium lattice constants using
total energy calculations and ﬁtting the standard equa-
tion of state to the total energy curve. The obtained
results are presented in the ﬁrst column of Table I. Lat-
tice constants present large variations from 5.64 ˚A for
(FeMn)TiP to 6.26 ˚A for (CoCr)TiBi due to the large
atomic radius of the Bi atoms. Interestingly these val-
ues are similar to the lattice constants of existing binary
semiconductors.

In the case of Heusler compounds with 24 va-
lence electrons, the ground state can be either non-
magnetic semiconducting or fully-compensated ferrimag-
netic semiconducting;23 in the latter case the atoms pos-
sess ﬁnite atomic spin magnetic moments but the total
magnetization is zero. Our ﬁrst principles calculations

reveal that for the compounds under study the non-
magnetic semiconducting is the ground state since we
were not able to converge to a fully-compensated ferri-
magnetic state irrespectively of the initial conﬁguration
of the atomic spin magnetic moments considered in our
calculations.

B. Band structure and energy gaps

Using the DFT results as an input we performed one-
shot GW calculations. Using (CoFe)TiAl as a represen-
tative example we will discuss the changes in the band
structure. The situation is similar for the other com-
pounds. First we should establish the convergence of
the energy gap using GW with respect to the number
of k-points and the number of energy bands taken into
account in the calculation. We present the results of our
convergence tests in Fig. 1. With a speciﬁc k-point grid
we need around 300 empty bands to have reliable values
for the GW energy gaps which corresponds to about 75
empty bands per atom since there are 4 atoms per unit
cell, a value which is similar to the well-known semicon-
ductors like Si or Ge. As the grid becomes denser the
energy gaps become smaller but we can see that the dif-
ference between the 6×6×6 and 8×8×8 is of the order of
0.01-0.02 eV and thus the former can be safely used.

We present the calculated band structure in Fig. 2
using both the PBE parametrization of GGA and the
GW method. First we shortly analyze the character of
the bands at the Γ point, giving the character of the or-
bitals in real space. The arguments are similar to the
case of usual half-metallic full and ordered quaternary
Heusler compounds.22,23 There is an s-band low in energy
not shown in Fig. 1. The lowest shown bands are the
Al p-bands, which are triple-degenerate at the Γ-point
and which also accommodate the d -charge of the transi-
tion metal atoms. Then there are the double-degenerate
eg and triple-degenerate (at the Γ-point) t2g d -hybrids
of the transition metal atoms which are in tetrahedral
symmetry. The states just below and just above the
Fermi level are the triple-degenerate t1u and the double-
degenerate eu states which are located exclusively at the

of (CoFe)TiAl along the high-symmetry directions in the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone using either the PBE-GGA (red dashed line)
or the GW (blue solid line) approximations.

Co and Fe sites in octahedral symmetry; for an extensive
discussion see Refs. 22 and 23.

The band structure using GW presented in Fig 2
looks qualitatively similar to the PBE-GGA results. The
bands, however, diﬀer quantitatively especially at ener-
gies away from the Fermi energy where the p and the
bonding eg and t2g hybrids reside. The change in the
bands originating from the eu and t1u hybrids is much
smaller and less visible. Mainly GW pushes the con-
duction (eu hybrids) and valence (t1u hybrids) bands,
respectively up and down, hence opening the band gap,
but the broadening does not exceed 0.2 eV. As a result
within PBE-GGA, (CoFe)TiAl is an almost-gapless semi-
conductor with a direct gap at the Γ-point of 0.08 eV
while within GW one could classify it as a narrow-band
semiconductor with a direct energy gap of 0.30 eV.

Finally in Table I we present both the PBE-GGA and
GW energy gaps for all compounds under study. First,
we should note for any chosen k-point the bands are well-
separated by a ﬁnite energy gap. This is reﬂected in the
direct Γ → Γ and X → X energy band gaps presented in
the table. For many of the compounds under study; the
fundamental energy gaps (EPBE

spectra of both materials are well described by the GW
calculations. In contrast, the band gap of wurtzite ZnO is
repeatedly underestimated by more than 1 eV within the
GW calculations with respect to its experimental value.
A recent GW calculation with the FLAPW method has
found its band gap higher than previous studies, but
still lower than its measured value.24 Better agreement
with experiment can be achieved with a self-consistent
procedure.25 Similarly, in the case of FeS2 pyrite, on the
other hand, the one-shot GW calculations ﬁnd a lower
value for the fundamental band gap.26

the indirect Γ → X gaps as seen in Table I. Moreover in
the case of (CoMn)VAl, (CoCr)TiSb and (CoCr)TiBi, the
overlap of the valence and conduction bands is such that
instead of getting a semiconductor we get a semimetallic-
like behavior of the density of states, i.e. in this case the
bottom of the conduction band is lower in energy than
the top of the valence band. This behavior is reﬂected in
the negative values given in the table.

The size of the gaps increases with the valence of the
sp atom as we move from Al to Si and then to P where
the valence electrons increase by one. A similar remark
can be made when we move along a column of isovalent
chemical elements from the lighter P to As, Sb and ﬁnally
Bi. To understand this trend we have to remark that the
d-hybrids below the Fermi level have also a small portion
of p character. For the lighter element like Al this ad-
mixture is sizeable and contributes to the opening of the
gap similarly to the usual p − d hybridization scheme in
semiconductors.12 As Al is substituted by heavier atoms,
their p states are located deeper in energy, the admix-
ture of the p character in the d bands decreases and the
energy gap shrinks. The use of GW increases systemat-
ically the values of both direct and indirect bands gaps
but this increase does not exceed 0.2 eV in all cases.
Even this moderate increase can transform the character
of (CoCr)TiSb from semimetallic-like to semiconducting.
Finally, we should also discuss the applicability of GW
to the study of the electronic band structure of materials.
Although in principle GW is a more elaborate method
to study the band structure of solids since it includes
the quasiparticle corrections, its success with respect to
standard density functional calculations is not guaran-
teed and results should be conﬁrmed by experiments.
Recently, Meinert et al.15 studied the band structure of
the half-metallic ferromagnetic full Heusler compounds,
Co2MnSi and Co2FeSi, via one-shot GW calculations and
found that the many-body corrections are crucial espe-
cially for the latter system, and experimentally studied

C. Eﬀect of the lattice parameter

Expanding or compressing lattices, and even slight
changes in the chemical composition alter dramatically
the lattice constants of compounds and their band-gap
energies. This so-called band-gap tuning, or band-gap
engineering, by any means has become quite important
in designing new multifunctional devices. The GW band-
gap energies of compounds (FeMn)TiP and (CoCr)TiP
are plotted as a function of their lattice constant in
Fig. 3. (FeMn)TiP is found to be a SC in both PBE and
GW calculations at its equilibrium lattice constant of
5.64 ˚A (see Table I), but it is predicted to be a semimetal
when its lattice constant is increased just about 3.6%.
Similarly, (CoCr)TiP seems to make a sharp transition
from a semiconducting to a semimetallic phase when its
lattice constant is extended approximately 2.3% from its
equilibrium value. Both compounds are found to be gap-
less when their lattice constants are assumed to be 6 ˚A.
Tailoring of the band-gap energy by substitution of sp-
elements in compounds (CoCr)TiZ is already discussed
above.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the quasi-particle band structure
of several transition-metal-based almost-gapless Heusler
semiconductors (XX′)YZ by using the one-shot GW
approximation within the framework of the FLAPW
method. We ﬁnd that in contrast to sp-electron based
semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, in these systems the
many-body correlations have a minimal eﬀect on the elec-
tronic band structure. For these compounds the change
of the energy band gap is less than 0.2 eV. Thus, the
standard density-functional-theory based ﬁrst-principles
calculations are a good approximation for describing the
electronic properties of these materials. Furthermore, the
band gap of these compounds can be tuned by varying
the lattice parameter or by substituting the main group
sp-element.
