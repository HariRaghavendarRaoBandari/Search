The power spectrum of a stationary process may be calculated in terms of the autocorrelation
function using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. We here generalize the Wiener-Khinchin theorem for
nonstationary processes and introduce a time-dependent power spectrum hStm (ω)i where tm is the
measurement time. For processes with an aging correlation function of the form hI(t)I(t + τ )i =
tΥφEA(τ /t), where φEA(x) is a nonanalytic function when x is small, we ﬁnd aging 1/f noise.
Aging 1/f noise is characterized by ﬁve critical exponents. We derive the relations between the
scaled correlation function and these exponents. We show that our deﬁnition of the time-dependent
spectrum retains its interpretation as a density of Fourier modes and discuss the relation to the
apparent infrared divergence of 1/f noise. We illustrate our results for blinking quantum dot
models, single-ﬁle diﬀusion and Brownian motion in logarithmic potential.

INTRODUCTION

The power spectrum of 1/f noise at low frequencies is:

trum, Stm (ω) = |R tm

In many applications, a random process I(t) recorded
in time interval [0, tm], is analyzed using the sample spec-
I(t′) exp(−ıωt′)dt′|2/tm, where
the measurement time tm is assumed to be long. For
a stationary process, the power spectrum is routinely
calculated from the autocorrelation function, C(τ ) =
hI(t)I(t + τ )i, using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem [1, 2];

Obviously not all physical processes are stationary [3–
14] and then the Wiener-Khinchin theorem (1) does not
hold. Extending the Wiener-Khinchin theorem to non-
stationary processes has been a topic of many works [15–
18]. Some relate it to the instantaneous power spectrum,
where it looses its meaning as a density since it may get
negative values (e.g.
[15, 16]). Others deal with a spe-
ciﬁc process such as telegraphic noise [17] or periodically
driven stochastic systems [18].

We here consider the power spectrum of systems ex-
hibiting scale invariant aging with a correlation function
of the form C(t, τ ) ∼ tΥφEA(τ /t), where (.)EA refers to
ensemble average. Such correlation functions appear in
a vast array of systems and models ranging from glassy
dynamics [10, 19, 20], blinking quantum dots [21], laser-
cooled atoms [22, 23], motion of a tracer particle in a
crowded environment [24, 25], elastic models of ﬂuctu-
ating interfaces [26], diﬀusion in heterogeneous environ-
ment [27], deterministic noisy Kuramoto models [28],
granular gases [29], deterministic intermittency [30], to
growing interfaces following the KPZ equation [31]. In
our recent publications [32, 33], we have generalized the
Wiener-Khinchin theorem to these aging processes by in-
troducing a time-dependent spectral density. We have
moreover established a correspondence to 1/f noise when
φEA(x) is not analytic for small argument.

S(ω) ∼ ω−β

0 < β < 2.

(2)

The value β = 0 corresponds to white noise and β = 2
to Brownian noise. 1/f noise, with a range of diﬀer-
ent exponents, occurs in many systems in a variety of
disciplines. A partial list includes electronic, solid and
condensed matter devices [34–37], sand-pile models [38],
blinking quantum dots [39, 40], nanoscale electrodes [41],
experimental data of voltage-dependent anion channel
in rats brains [42] and processes modeled by nonlinear-
stochastic-diﬀerential equations [43].

In [44] Mandelbrot suggested that “one needs a non-
Wienerian spectral theory to account for f θ−2 noise”,
where a time-series-length-dependent spectrum might
be measured [44, 45].
Indeed, as shown theoretically
[5, 6, 46] and experimentally [41, 47], the power spec-
trum of a blinking quantum dot and of nano electrodes
ages, namely as the measurement time becomes longer
the intensity of the measured noise is reduced, decaying
as a power law.

Traditional studies of 1/f β noise characterize the spec-
trum with a single exponent β. In the recent experiment
[47], the aging properties of 1/f noise were characterized
with the help of ﬁve diﬀerent exponents, β, z, µ, η and δ
deﬁned as follows: the asymptotic power spectrum is of
the form S(ω) ∼ Atm ω−β with the time-dependent am-
plitude Atm ∼ (tm)−z for long times and low-frequencies
cutoﬀ ωmin ∼ (tm)−η. Furthermore, the “power” at zero
frequency is S(0) ∼ (tm)µ and the total measured power
R ∞
S(ω)dω ∼ (tm)δ. Our aim is here to derive these
1/tm
ﬁve exponents from the correlation function for general
aging processes and investigate their relationships. We
apply our ﬁnding to blinking quantum dot models [21],
as well as to single ﬁle diﬀusion [24, 25] and diﬀusion in
a logarithmic potential [22, 23]. Sample paths of these
models, i.e. a representative time trace of these processes,
are shown in Fig. 1. Visually these processes appear
very diﬀerent, the underlying unifying theme is their de-

scription in terms of a scale invariant correlation function
which leads to 1/f noise.

For stationary processes, the spectrum is related to
the discrete Fourier modes at the natural frequencies
ωn = 2πn/tm with n integer [1]. The integral of the spec-
trum over all frequencies is ﬁnite and equal to the sum
of the Fourier modes’ intensities. Since the spectrum is
thus positive and normalizable, we can interpret it as the
continuous distribution of Fourier modes in the limit of
inﬁnite measurement time. By contrast, 1/f noise with
β > 1 exhibits a non-integrable infrared divergence and
thus inﬁnite power, which has led to some discussions on
its physical interpretation [5, 44, 45]. We show that al-
lowing for a measurement-time dependent spectrum nat-
urally resolves this apparent paradox, as the power re-
mains ﬁnite at ﬁnite times. Thus even for nonstation-
ary processes, the spectrum retains its interpretation as
a density in frequency space. While for ﬁnite measure-
ment times, the detectable Fourier modes are of course
discrete, we argue that nevertheless, the spectrum can
also be understood as a continuous function of frequency.
This function then exhibits scale invariant oscillations,
which can yield additional information on the critical ex-
ponents not contained in the natural frequencies.

The outline of the paper is the following. In Sects. II
and III, we derive the generalized Wiener-Khinchin theo-
rem connecting the aging correlation function C(t, τ ) and
the time-dependent spectral density Stm (ω). In Sect. IV
we evaluate explicitly the spectral density for a scale in-
variant correlation function and discuss the relationship
with 1/f noise. We then compute in Sect. V the ﬁve
critical exponents characterizing 1/f noise. In Sect. VI,
we compare the properties of the time dependent spec-
trum to stationary case and discuss its relation to Fourier
modes. Finally, in Sects. VII, VIII and IX, we apply our
results to concrete examples: blinking quantum dot, sin-
gle ﬁle diﬀusion and diﬀusion in a logarithmic potential.

II. AGING POWER SPECTRUM: THE

TIME-AVERAGED FORMALISM

For a nonstationary process, the ensemble-average au-
tocorrelation function is hI(t)I(t + τ )i = C(t, τ ) and
depends explicitly on the time t and the lag time τ .
To examine analytically the temporal behavior of the
power spectrum, we follow Mandelbrot [44] and deﬁne
the power spectrum of a random signal I(t) as Stm(ω) =
I(t′) exp(−ıωt′)dt′,
and tm is the measurement time. The spectrum, by this
deﬁnition, is,

We emphasize that the ensemble- and time-average cor-
relation functions, C(t, τ ) and CTA(tm, τ ), are not identi-
cal for the underlying processes considered in this paper.
In the following, we consider time-averaged correlation
functions of the scaling form

at all times τ and t. Systems which exhibit this type of
correlation scaling behavior have been discussed in Refs.
[10, 19–21, 24–26, 28–31, 49]. By taking the ensemble av-
erage of Eq. (8), we directly obtain a connection between
time- and ensemble- averaged scaling function

(9)

For the time being, we assume that this asymptotic scal-
ing is valid for all τ and tm. For real physical systems this
is an approximation, as we discuss in Sects. VII-IX. We
also assume hIi is a constant independent of time, see
further discussion in Appendix A. Substituting Eq. (9)
in Eq. (7) and changing variables (x = τ /t1), we obtain
what we call the time-averaged form of the aging Wiener-
Khinchin theorem,

trum hStm(ω)i. Care must be taken when evaluating
information on the underlying correlation function from

III. AGING POWER SPECTRUM: THE
ENSEMBLE-AVERAGED FORMALISM

where ˜ω = ωtm.

In the present section we derive a relation between the
ensemble-averaged autocorrelation function C(t, τ ) and
the average time-dependent power spectrum hStm (ω)i.
We assume, as before, that the correlation function scales
as

C(t, τ ) = tΥφEA(τ /t).

where 1F2[a; b1, b2; z] refers to the hypergeometric func-
tion and Υ > −2 for convergence. Equation (18) is
our second aging Wiener-Khinchin theorem connecting
the ensemble-average scaling correlation function φEA to
the sample spectrum. The inverse formula, which relates
the power spectrum to the ensemble-average correlation

function, is

C(tm − τ, τ ) =

This inversion is general and valid for any type of corre-

lation function.

Equations (10) and (18) provide two forms of aging
Wiener-Khinchin theorem, relating the sample spectrum
to either the time- or ensemble- average scaling correla-
tion function. The choice between the theorems depends
on the practical application. Most theoretical works pro-
vide an ensemble average correlation function φEA(x). In
this case, to use Eq. (10) we need to determine the time
averaged correlation function from Eq. (13) ﬁrst. On the
other hand, to use Eq. (18) we need to determine the
time dependency of the correlation function, in partic-
ular the exponent Υ, which in experimental situations
is a-priori unknown, though it could be estimated from
data. In addition, the inverse formula Eq. (19) contains
a derivative term, which may increase measurement er-
rors (see Appendix B where the inversion is performed
for a speciﬁc example). Still, both formalisms are clearly
equivalent and useful.

IV. SCALE-INVARIANT CORRELATION

FUNCTION AND THE POWER SPECTRUM

We next compute the power spectrum for a scaling

function of the form

φEA(x) ≈(cid:26) a0 − aVxV
b0 − bΛxΛ

x ≪ 1
x ≫ 1

.

(20)

where a0, b0, aV and bΛ are constants which are deter-
mined by the speciﬁc process. Using Eq. (13) we ﬁnd the
time averaged correlation function

ϕTA(x) ≈(cid:26) ˜a0 − ˜aVxV

˜b0(1 − x)Υ − ˜bΛ(1 − x)Υ−Λ

x ≪ 1
1 − x ≪ 1

(21)
where ˜a0 = a0/(1 + Υ), ˜b0 = b0/(1 + Υ), ˜aV = aV/(1 +
Υ− V) and ˜bΛ = bΛ/(1 + Υ− Λ). We assume 0 < |V| < 1,
Υ − V > −1, Λ < 0 and Υ − Λ > −1 for convergence.
These conditions are naturally satisﬁed for all relevant
examples, see Table. I and Sects. VII-IX.

Using Eq. (10), the power spectrum for such a process
in the limit ωtm = 2πn where n is a large positive integer,
is

hStm(ω)iωtm=2πn ≈ 2˜aV

sin(πV/2)Γ(1 + V)

(22)

Accordingly, the scale-invariant correlation function (20)
leads to 1/f noise. The next leading terms are

. (23)

When ωtm is treated as a continuous variable, Eq. (23)
exhibits oscillations. For speciﬁc examples, these oscilla-
tions are discussed in Sects. VII-IX. The conditions on

4

the exponents Υ, V and Λ guarantee that the 1/f spec-
trum Eq. 22 is indeed the leading order for large ωtm.
Exact 1/f noise, with β = 1 and logarithmic time de-
pendence [6], is not discussed here and left for a future
work. In Sects. VII-IX we show that this result is not
valid for arbitrarily large frequencies, since then the scal-
ing assumption breaks down.

We note that when ωtm ≫ 1 the spectrum is con-
trolled by the ﬁrst term, which was determined by the
nonanalytic expansion of the correlation function when
τ ≪ tm. The oscillating behavior seen in Eq. (23) is a
ﬁnite-measurement-time eﬀect and is related to the cor-
relation function when τ ∼ tm. Thus detecting these
oscillations gives insight on the details of the underly-
ing correlation function.
In fact since 1/f spectrum is
so common, yet its physical origin still remains unclear
in many cases, the oscillating part of the spectrum might
be a valuable tool for distinguishing between microscopic
models. These oscillations depend only on the scaling
variable ωtm and are universal in that sense. In our ex-
amples below Eq. (22) works well also when ωtm ≈ 1.
We note that when the spectrum is evaluated on the
natural frequencies ωtm = 2πn, n ∈ N, then according
to Eq. (22) the power spectrum is characterized by two
exponents; Υ and V. These are given in Table I for spe-
ciﬁc systems exhibiting aging. When we consider the
continuous frequencies then, according to Eq. (23), the
spectrum is quantiﬁed using three exponents Υ, V and Λ
describing the time and frequency dependence of the 1/f
spectrum. Below we discuss three additional exponents,
which characterize the process.

V. CRITICAL EXPONENTS AND SCALING

RELATIONS

As mentioned in the introduction, traditional theories
of 1/f β noise characterize the spectrum with a single ex-
ponent β. However, this is not suﬃcient as recent studies
show [5, 6, 41, 47]. We follow [47] and characterize the
ﬁnite-time power spectra Stm(ω) with ﬁve power laws as
follows: (i) The power spectrum frequency dependence;
S(ω) ∼ ω−β for low frequencies, (ii) the power spectrum
time dependence; S(ω) ∼ Atm ω−β where Atm ∼ t−z
m
for long times, (iii) the lower cutoﬀ time dependence;
ωmin ∼ t−η
m , (iv) the power at zero frequency; S(0) ∼ tµ
m
and (v) the total measured power; R ∞
S(ω)dω ∼ tδ
m.
In the present section we compute these exponents from
the properties of the correlation function. We will later
consider three physical models where these exponents are
calculated explicitly; see Tables II and III for a summary.
We consider a process with a correlation function with
the scaling behavior Eq. (20). The critical exponent β
which is determined by the power-law decay of the aver-
age power spectra in Eq. (22) is

1/tm

β = 1 + V,

(24)

where β 6= 1. In addition the aging exponent z which is

related to the time decay is

z = V − Υ,

(25)

so clearly β = 1 + z + Υ. When β = 1 logarithmic
time corrections are expected [6].
In an experimental
situation the exponent Υ may be measured through the
zero-frequency power as described in the next paragraph.

To determine the exponent Υ one may measure

I(t)dt/tm. Of course the zero frequency cannot be
0
considered part of the spectrum itself, at least not in the
traditional sense, since in a ﬁnite time measurement one
cannot detect a frequency shorter than 2π/tm. However,
this does not imply that it cannot be measured, it is
rather easy to do so. For a stationary process hStm(0)i
is linearly dependent on the measurement time tm. For
a nonstationary process its time dependence is related to
the exponent Υ as follows.

When the ensemble-average correlation function is
scaled as Eq. (12) the power density at zero frequency
is

The exponent µ is hence given by

µ = 1 + Υ.

(27)

(28)

Notice that the scaling relation µ = β − z is also valid.
This relation was suggested in Ref. [47] in the context of
blinking quantum dot models.

Remark: Equation (26) was already obtained in the
context of a scaling Green-Kubo relation [49]. The scal-
ing Green-Kubo formula expresses the relation between
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of an enhanced diﬀusion pro-
cess, and the scale-invariant velocity correlation function.
The mean square displacement is equivalent to tm hS(0)i
which is the spectrum in zero-frequency multiplied by the
measurement time tm.

B. Lower Cutoﬀ Time Dependence

The lower cutoﬀ time dependence ωmin ∼ t−η

m is deﬁned
by the transition frequency between the power-law decay
hStm(ω)iωtm≫1 and hStm(0)i. By comparing Eq. (22) and
where AV =
Eq. (27), i.e.
2 ˜aV sin(πV/2)Υ(1 + V), we ﬁnd
ωmin ∼ t−1
m .

hStm(0)i = AVtΥ−V

m ω−1−V

(29)

min

We thus conclude that η = 1, for all processes with cor-
relation function in the form of Eq. (12).

The existence of such a cutoﬀ is required since a purely
1/f noise cannot exist in the range 0 < f < ∞ for the
following reasons; ﬁrst, the power at zero frequency must
be ﬁnite since (cid:10) ¯I 2
tm(cid:11) < ∞, for every ﬁnite measurement

time. Second, we expect the total power to be ﬁnite at
every ﬁnite measurement time, since

dω hStm(ω)i = 2πtΥ

mϕTA(0),

(30)

−∞

even though Eq. (23) is not integrable in [0,∞). Notice
that the sample spectrum is time-dependent although its
1/f part might be time-independent, e.g.
if Υ = V.
Therefore, measuring 1/f noise, even time independent,

does not contradict the ﬁnite power requirement. Equa-
tion (30) implies that hStm (ω)i is normalized, provided
ϕTA(0) is ﬁnite, and since it is non-negative it satisﬁes
the conditions for a normalized density.

C. The Total Power Time Dependence

diverges since R ∞

For an ideal 1/f source the total power of the process
If β < 1 (β > 1) the
integral diverges due to the high (low) frequency limit.
We should be mainly concerned with low frequency, since
the whole behavior of 1/f is found in that regime. In-
deed, as we show below, there always exists a physical
mechanism that leads to cutoﬀ at large frequencies. As
was mentioned in Sect. V the total measured power is

Taking ωmax → ∞ the total power time dependence
scales as tΥ
For bounded processes, we expect that the total power
will not increase as a function of time, namely Υ ≤ 0. By
contrast, in open (i.e. unbounded) processes, the total
measured power may increase with measurement time,
as for example single-ﬁle diﬀusion in inﬁnite system, as
we will discuss below.

VI. THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

POWER SPECTRUM

We now compare between the properties of Wienerian
and aging power spectra clarifying the meaning of the lat-
ter. Stationary processes I(t) and their power spectrum
have the following properties:

(i) hIi is a constant independent of time.
(ii) hI 2i is a constant independent of time and the cor-
relations function hI(t + τ )I(t)i is a function of τ
only.

(iii) The power spectrum is non negative.

(iv) The total power is

hS(ω)i = tm|an|2 in the limit of large tm.

See further discussion in Appendix A and in Ref. [1].
Properties (iii − v) are important, they show that the
power spectrum is the distribution of the modes of the
system, and that we may normalize the power spectrum.
Indeed in many cases the normalized power spectral den-
sity is considered, namely hS(ω)i/[2πhI 2i].
Our approach provides a non-Wienerian framework
for the power spectrum.
It is thus natural to ask how
the above points translate to the nonstationary, non-
Wienerian case.

(i) hIi is a constant independent of time.
(ii) Here hI(t + τ )I(t)i = tΥφEA(τ /t) is the starting

point. So we get by deﬁnition

hI 2(t)i = tΥφEA(0).

(35)

(iii) The power spectrum hStm (ω)i ≥ 0 due the deﬁni-

tion of the periodogram.

(iv) We ﬁnd

Here the overline stands for a time average. The
key to the interpretation of the power-spectrum is
Eq. (13) from which we ﬁnd

S(ω)dω = 2πhI 2i.

(33)

This well-known property is easily veriﬁed using the
Wiener-Khinchin theorem.

Hence exactly like the stationary theory, for scale
invariant correlation functions, the total power is
given by hI 2i. Hence it is fully justiﬁed to call
hStm (ω)i the power spectral density. When Υ = 0
the analogy is complete.

(v) Also here rule (34) holds, with PT given in the pre-
vious item (see discussion in Appendix A with re-
spect to ﬁltering).

We see that even though the correlation function is by
deﬁnition far from being stationary, the main structure
of power spectrum theory is left untouched, though now
the power spectrum is dependent on the measurement
time.

Since the aging spectrum is very diﬀerent from the
Wienerian one, we actually have two methods to present
it (as shown all along this work). The spectrum of 1/f
noise source of the type discussed in this manuscript,
should be presented, if possible, using two plots; The
ﬁrst is hS(ω)i versus ω where ωn = 2πn/tm, this repre-
sents the true spectrum in the sense that Fourier modes
in (0, tm) are discrete. As well known within this tradi-
tional presentation, 1/f noise presents an infrared diver-
gence, S(f ) ∼ f −β which β ≥ 1 implies naively that the
total energy of the process is inﬁnite (the low-frequency
paradox of 1/f noise [5, 44]). To gain better insight on
this low-frequency behavior we consider a second “spec-
trum” where hS(ω)i is continuous in 0 ≤ ω < ∞. This
spectrum yields insights on the low-frequency behavior,
namely the oscillations of the spectrum and the zero-
frequency component hS(0)i. All these yield signiﬁcant
insight on the process, e.g. the exponents Υ, V, Λ, β,
z, η, µ and δ. By contrast, evaluating the spectrum at
the natural frequencies yields only the 1/f component,
which provides partial information on the spectrum, i.e.
the exponents Υ, β, z and δ. We would like to empha-
size that all ﬁve exponents related to the spectrum; β,
z, η, µ and δ can be evaluated from natural frequency
data, provided that one adds one single measurement:
the time dependent behavior of Stm (0). And three of
them: β, z, and δ can be evaluated even without infor-
mation on the zero frequency spectrum (then the cutoﬀ

is simply 1/tm). The continuous spectrum advantage is
that it can give further information, for example by the
analysis of oscillations of the spectrum we may estimate
Λ which yields information on the large argument behav-
ior of the correlation function. So while hS(ω)i on the
natural frequencies ωn = 2πn/tm has the advantage of
a clear interpretation in terms of Fourier modes, see e.g.
Kubo et al.
[1], the continuous spectrum gives insights
on the underlying process which should not be ignored.
The fact that the scaling correlation function on which
we base our analysis can be observed in a wide range
of systems, beyond the speciﬁc examples discussed here,
underlines the universality of our main results.

VII. BLINKING QUANTUM DOT MODEL

We next demonstrate the above results by studying
a stochastic model for blinking-quantum dots. A quan-
tum dot is a nanocrystal that, when interacting with a
continuous wave exciting laser ﬁeld, switches at random
times between on and oﬀ states [51, 52]. Such a pro-
cess is an example of a renewal process. To analyze such
systems we follow previous works (e.g. [21, 46, 53]) and
deﬁne a two-state system, where I(t) = 0 is the state
“oﬀ” and I(t) = 1 is “on”. Without loss of generality
we choose the system to be initially in I(0) = 1. At each
time tn the system switches to the other state alternately
(“on” → “oﬀ” or “oﬀ” → “on”). The renewal times are
tn = Pn
0 τi where {τi} are distributed according to the
PDF ψ(τ ) and n is the number of renewals until time
tn (see Fig. 2). We assume that the “on” and “oﬀ”
times {τi} are uncorrelated. The “oﬀ” sojourn times are
power-law distributed ψ(τ ) ∼ τ −(1+α) with 0 < α < 1.
For the “on” times we consider two cases; In the ﬁrst
one the “on” times are distributed with inﬁnite mean,
e.g. power-law distribution ψ(τ ) ∼ τ −(1+α) (see real-

ization of I(t) in Fig. 1 with α = 0.8). In the second
case we consider “on” times with ﬁnite mean distribu-
tion, e.g. power-law distribution with an exponentially
decaying of the tail. Both cases were experimentally ex-
amined [47, 54]. Such a system follows a power-law inter-
mittency route to 1/f noise. This means that power-law
waiting times in a substate of the system are responsible
for the observed spectrum. This approach was suggested
as a fundamental mechanism for 1/f noise in the context
of intermittency of chaos and turbulence in the work of
Manneville [55]. We note that the renewal process de-
scribes not only blinking dots, but also the trap model,
a well-known model of glassy dynamics [7, 20]. The con-
nection between the two systems is the power-law waiting
times in the microstates of the system.

in Refs. [5, 21, 46, 53, 56, 57].

The same result is found by taking the limit of ωtm ≫ 1
in Eq. (42). The aging Wiener-Khinchin theorem repro-
duces the result Eq. (43) that was found before, e.g.
in
Ref. [46]. To evaluate the oscillating behavior we use
Eq. (23) and ﬁnd

Now we consider that the “on” sojourn times have a
ﬁnite mean hτi, while the “oﬀ” times are power-law dis-
tributed as the ﬁrst case ψoﬀ (τ ) ∼ (τ0/τ )1+α (see the
measurements in [47]). In Laplace space (s → t) we ﬁnd
for small s when 0 < α < 1

In Fig. 3 simulation results are compared with the exact
analytic prediction Eq. (42) and excellent agreement is
observed. Figure 3 further conﬁrms the validity of the
two approximated spectra: First, the 1/f noise Eq. (43)
for discrete frequencies ωtm = 2πn agrees well with the
simulations when n ∈ N. Moreover, the oscillatory be-
havior Eq. (44) for continuous frequencies, presents a
good agreement in the limit ωtm ≫ 1.

3. Critical Exponents

The critical exponent β, which is determined by the
power-law decay of the average power spectra, is β =
2 − α for the inﬁnite mean ‘on’ sojourn time. The aging
exponent which is related to the time decay is z = 1− α.
The averaged zero-frequency power spectrum is deﬁned
as hS(ω = 0)i = t−1

ometric function (see Fig. 4).

We note that Eqs. (42) and (50) are valid only for ﬁnite
˜ω even though Eq. (16) imposes no such restriction. For
very large frequency we expect to get non-scaling devia-
tions, since then the scale invariant correlation function is
not strictly valid for the Wiener-Khinchim theorem. For
illustrations see Fig. 4 where a diﬀerent behavior emerges
at large ω. This is a consequence of taking the correlation
function in long time limit, i.e. t,τ → ∞. Information
about the correlation function for short τ is necessary to
ﬁnd the behavior of the spectrum at high frequencies. A
more detailed discussion will be published elsewhere [?
]. However, Fig. 4 clearly illustrates that as we increase
the measurement time the asymptotic theory perfectly
matches the theory.

In Fig. 4 we compare the simulation results with the the-
ory Eq. (50). The 1/f noise with oscillatory corrections
Eq. (52) shows good agreement with numerical results
for intermediate frequencies.

2. Critical Exponents

From Eq. (43) we conclude that β = α and z = 1 − α.

The averaged zero-frequency power spectrum is then

hStm(0)i =

hτi2

αΓ(2α)a2 t2α−1
m .

(53)

We therefore ﬁnd µ = 2α − 1 for this case. This re-
sult is reasonable since the zero frequency power is the
squared-time-average signal I(t) times the measurement
time. The integral over I(t) between zero and tm is pro-
portional to Ntm times the average “on” time hτi, where
Ntm is the number of renewals until time tm. Ntm itself is
proportional to tα
m, a well known result in renewal theory
[56]. Hence we get Stm (0) ∝ t2α−1
m .
Interestingly in this case the value of α changes the
behavior of hStm (0)i, namely if α > 1/2 then hStm(0)i
increases in time, if α < 1/2, it decreases in time, and
when α = 1/2 then hStm (0)i is time independent.

The low-frequencies cutoﬀ ωmin is,

ωmin =(cid:18) 2 cos(πα/2)Γ(2α)

Γ(α)

(cid:19)1/α

t−1
m .

(54)

Therefore we ﬁnd that in both cases the low-frequencies
cutoﬀ decays in time with the same exponent, η = 1, and
diﬀers by a prefactor only.

The behavior of the total measured power is addition-

ally

Z ωmax

(55)

As a result δ = α − 1. The decrease of the total power
with measurement time is reasonable since the signal ex-
hibits longer and longer “oﬀ” times, while the “on” times
remains ﬁnite.

FIG. 4: The simulation results (circles) for the hStm (ω)i in the
blinking-quantum-dot model with ﬁnite-mean-“on” times and
the power-law-“oﬀ” times . We use α = 0.5 at three diﬀerent
measurement times, tm = 103 (blue), tm = 104 (pink) and
t = 105 (green). The solid black line represents Eq. (50) and
red line is Eq. (52). As we increase measurement time the
simulations approach theoretical prediction.

In Eq. (30) we showed that the total power propor-
tional to tγ
mϕT A(0). This is true for the ideal pro-
cess, where the scale invariant correlation functions are
valid for all t and τ , and then ϕT A(0) < ∞. We
note that Eq. (49) gives ϕT A(0) → ∞, hence we can-
not use this equation to evaluate ϕT A(0). Generally,
we should use R ∞
Indeed,
for this case the ensemble average correlation function
is C(t, τ = 0) ∝ tα−1 as is given in [21]. Then, following
Eqs. (9),(12),(13), we ﬁnd CTA(t, τ = 0) ∝ tα−1 as well.

0 S(ω)dω = π hCT A(tm, 0)i.

VIII. SINGLE FILE DIFFUSION

The second example that we investigate is single-ﬁle
diﬀusion. Single-ﬁle diﬀusion refers to the motion of par-
ticles in unidimensional systems, where the particles can-
not pass each other, hence their ordering is preserved.
We assume an inﬁnite system, and we are interested in
the displacement x(t) of a tagged particle while all other
particles playing the role of a bath [58–60]. This kind of
system can be used as a model for the motion of a single
molecule in a crowed unidimensional environment such
as a biological pore or channel [61, 62], and experimental
studies of physical systems such as zeolites [63] and col-
loid particles in conﬁned topology [64] or optical tweezers
[65].

We distinguish between two initial conﬁgurations of
the bath: a thermal (equilibrium) initial condition (de-
noted as (.)uni) and a non-thermal initial condition of
equally spaced particles (labeled (.)lat). The free particle
diﬀusion coeﬃcient is D and the average spacing between
nearest particles is a. We note that the tagged particle is
aﬀected by the surrounding particles only at long times,

i.e.
tagged particle diﬀuses normally.

By using Eq. (16) we ﬁnd that the spectrum for the equi-

In the limit ωtm = 2πn ≫ 1, the power spectrum seems
to be time independent. However, we note that the spec-
trum hStm (ω)i remains time dependent. Hence, for every
ﬁnite time tm, the total power is ﬁnite, because of the
low-frequency cutoﬀ at ω ∼ 1/tm, see Sect. V.C. More-
over, measurements of the spectrum hStm(ω)i made with-
out knowledge of initial conditions would be consistent
within the range of frequencies allowed by the limited ob-
servation time. In other words, the spectrum in the high
frequencies limit, ω ≫ 1/tm, is not aﬀected by the initial
condition, although the process is nonstationary.

As we see in Fig. 5, these results are conﬁrmed by simu-

As in the blinking quantum dot model we have assumed
a scaling form of the correlation function Eq. (56), which
works in the limit of large time. Information on the cor-
relation function for short times is needed to estimate
the very high frequency limit of the spectrum. Hence the
deviations at high frequencies in Fig. 5 are expected. As
the measurement time is increased, the spectrum plotted
as a function of ˜ω perfectly approaches the predictions of
our theory (see also the following example and Fig. 6).

By using Eqs. (20,22), we further ﬁnd that the power
spectrum corresponding to the random displacement x(t)
reads

even though for every ﬁnite time the total power is ﬁnite.

IX. BROWNIAN MOTION IN A

LOGARITHMIC POTENTIAL

The third model that we consider is a Langevin equa-
tion with a logarithmic binding potential. Such a case is
related, for example, to optical lattices, where x is the
momentum [23, 66]. It further describes the denaturing
of DNA [67], Manning condensation on a polymer [68] or
vortex dynamics [69]. Such a case is interesting since it is
“weakly” bound, and hence may exhibit diﬀerent prop-
erties than free Brownian motion or Langevin dynamics
in a harmonic potential [22, 70].

ment with Langevin simulation results for not too large

frequencies (see Fig. 6). Initially, the particle is situated
at the origin x(t = 0) = 0. Therefore, at short time the
particle is not aﬀected by the logarithmic tail of the po-
tential. We thus expect a deviation from theory at high
frequencies.

We conclude that for both cases, 1 < α < 2 and 2 < α <

in particular its interpretation as a density of Fourier
modes.

The nonstationarity of the correlation function does
not necessarily imply that the spectrum in the 1/f regime
is time dependent. Indeed we have found that the 1/f
spectrum of single ﬁle diﬀusion and diﬀusion in log po-
tential are time independent. This happens because in
these models, Υ = V. Namely the property of the corre-
lation function determines if the aging exponent z is zero
or not. Therefore, by measuring time-independent 1/f
noise, one cannot conclude that the process is stationary.
This is well known for Brownian motion where the under-
lying process is nonstationary and the power spectrum is
of f −2 type. One way to reveal the nonstationarity is to
present the data as S/(tΥ+1
m ) versus ˜ω = ωtm and see if
a scaling solution in found. Another way is to search for
the oscillations, see Eq. (23).

In addition, we have shown how the power spectrum
for the single ﬁle system, depends on the initial condition.
This theme could be further investigated for example in
KPZ models [31], or when the measurement of blinking
dots does not start at the beginning of the process, i.e.
the eﬀect of a waiting time on the power spectrum is
important [10, 71].

where ωmin ∼ 1/tm and ωmax is time independent. When
1 < α < 2 the total power increases with the time tm,
i.e. it diverges when tm → ∞, since this case corresponds
high temperature or shallow potential (1 < U0/kBT < 3)
and thus the particle exhibits subdiﬀusion. When 2 <
α < 3 (i.e. 3 < U0/kBT < 5) we ﬁnd that the to-
tal measured power in the frequencies range (ωmin, ωmax)
converges to a constant, i.e. eﬀectively the particle is
bounded. Therefore, its critical exponents are η = 2 − α
for 1 < α < 2 and η = 0 for 2 < α < 3.

Following [1] we consider a signal I(t) which is observed
over an interval (0, tm). Expand I(t) in a Fourier series

X. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have extended the Wiener-Khinchin theorem to
nonstationary spectra by deriving two general relations
between time- and ensemble- averaged correlation func-
tions and the aging power spectrum [32, 33]. We have
moreover established the generic occurrence of 1/f noise
for nonanalytic ensemble averaged correlation functions
and derived the corresponding ﬁve critical exponents. We
have evaluated these exponents for three models: blink-
ing quantum dot, single ﬁle diﬀusion and diﬀusion in a
logarithmic potential. The nonstationary spectrum re-
tains all the important properties of the stationary one,

an =

1

tm Z tm

0

I(t)e−ıωntdt,

(A2)

then Itm (ω) = antm (see Sect. II in the main text). We
deﬁne the spectrum for ﬁnite time as

hStm(ω)i ≡ tm(cid:10)|an|2(cid:11) ,

(A3)

where the measurement time tm is assume to be long.

We consider the blinking-quantum-dot model with
long waiting time. Thus the ensemble averaged signal
is simply a constant, hI(t)i = 1/2 (when starting in the
“on” state this is valid in the long time limit [21]). The
average Fourier coeﬃcient then is

hani = hIiδn0.

(A4)

When a suitable ﬁlter is used one may select a large
number of the Fourier modes related to frequencies lying
in the interval ∆ω, and hence observe a smooth power
spectral density;

(A6)

where n 6= m (a topic left for future work). The last

1. Zero-Frequency Contribution

We brieﬂy remind the reader, some basic properties
of Wienerian processes, using an example. Consider a
process I(t) with a stationary correlation function

hI(t)I(t + τ )i =h(cid:10)I 2(cid:11) − hIi2i e−τ + hIi2 .

(A7)

Following Wiener-Khinchin theorem Eq. (1) we obtain
the spectrum;

hS(ω)i = 2π hIi2 δ(ω) +h(cid:10)I 2(cid:11) − hIi2i

2

1 + ω2 .

(A8)

In experimental situations the zero-frequency power is
not usually reported in the total power estimation.
Therefore we expect to observe

S(ω)dω = πh(cid:10)I 2(cid:11) − hIi2i .

Including the zero point gives

S(ω)dω = πh(cid:10)I 2(cid:11) + hIi2i .

(A9)

(A10)

Now, we have two ways to estimate hI 2i from the power
spectrum; The ﬁrst one, is to shift the stationary process
I(t) in such a way that hIi = 0. The second one is to
use the total power of a stationary process following the
Wiener-Khinchin theorem [1]

Illustration in Blinking-Quantum-Dot Model

We use the blinking-quantum-dot model to to demon-
strate numerically the estimation of the total power.
Here we present three methods of estimation the cor-
relation function from the power spectrum. We compare
our results with the analytic results, see Fig. 7. Summing

where in this model φEA(0) = ϕTA(0) = π/2 and Υ = 0
(see Eq. (41)).

The ﬁrst method of evaluation of the total power is
using the approximate spectrum Eq. (43) for hStm (ω)i.
It gives

n=1 n−k is the Riemann zeta function.
The last term π(2 − α)/4 is related to the contribu-
tion from n = 0. The deviation from the exact value
Eq. (A20) may caused by the deviations of the approx-
imate natural frequencies spectrum Eq. (43) from the
exact spectrum Eq. (42) for small n. It means that the
1/f noise formula Eq. (43) is not suﬃcient for a precise
estimate of the total power (see Fig. 7).

As a second method for the estimation of the total
power one may use use the exact expression for the spec-
trum Eq. (42). The problem with this method is that
there is no analytic expression for the inﬁnite summa-
tion. To proceed we use a cutoﬀ, ωN = 2πN/tm where
N = 103, for the large frequencies.

meric integration for a certain measurement time tm, or
equivalently increasing N . Where N → ∞ we recover
Eq. (11) in the text.
In Fig. 8 we show the estimation of the time averaged
correlation function for a blinking quantum dot model
where the sojourn times {τi} are distributed with the
PDF Eq. (40). We ﬁrst ﬁnd the power spectrum using
the method presented in App. C. We then apply Eq. (B3)
to our ‘experimental’ data, to ﬁnd ϕTA(x) which is pre-
sented in Fig. 8.

We use the sample power spectrum deﬁnition,

i.e.
Stm(ω) = |Itm (ω)|2/tm.
In each system we gener-
ate the time series of the signal I(t) and use discrete
Fourier transform to ﬁnd Itm(ω) and its complex conju-
gate Itm (ω)∗. The simulation was done by Matlab stan-
dard fast Fourier transform (FFT) function. The power
spectrum simulating in the renewal process may be faster
by using the method below instead of using FFT func-
tion.

1. Blinking Quantum Dot Simulation

As was mentioned in the text, the process is deﬁned
with two states, Iof f = 0 and Ion = 1, with random
sojourn times in each state {τi}. The system switches
states alternately, “oﬀ”↔“on”, every time tn = Pi τi.
The random sojourn times τi are generated with τ =
x−1/α where x is random uniformly distributed in the
interval (0, 1). With that generation process we ﬁnd

ψ(τ ) = ατ −1−α

τ > 1,

(D1)

i.e. τ0 = 1, and its Laplace transform is

ψ(s) = αE1+α(s),

Using Equation (D6) simpliﬁes the simulations since ﬁnd-
k=1 τk is faster then ﬁnd the
entire sequence of I(t) and use FFT. At last, we average
over the realizations set.

2. Single-File Diﬀusion Simulation Details

In the single-ﬁle process we generate the signal x(t) by
using the method in [25]. We used the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient D = 0.5 and the average distance between nearest
particles as a = 1.

The power spectrum for a single realization is deﬁned

We generated x(t) in processes which are modeled with
Eq. (64), with discretization of the Langevin equation.
Namely for single realization we use
