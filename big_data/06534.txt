Received (Day Month Year)
Revised (Day Month Year)

In this work we extend the discussion that was began in the Ref. 16 [A. L. de Paula
Jr., J. G. G. de Oliveira Jr., J. G. Peixoto de Faria, Dagoberto S. Freitas and M. C.
Nemes, Phys. Rev. A89, (2014) 022303] to deal with the dynamics of the concurrence of
a many-body system. In that previous paper, the discussion was focused in the residual
entanglement between the partitions of the system. The purpose of the present contri-
bution is to shed some light on the dynamical properties of entanglement among the
environment oscillators. We consider a system consisting of a harmonic oscillator lin-
early coupled to N others and solve the corresponding dynamical problem analytically.
We divide the environment in arbitrary two partitions and the entanglement dynamics
between any of these partitions is quantiﬁed and it shows that in the case that excita-
tions in each partitions are equal, the concurrence reaches the value one and the two
partition of the environment are maximally entangled. For long times the excitations
of the main oscillator are completely transferred to environment and the environment
oscillators are found entangled.

Keywords: Many-body system; Entanglement; Concurrence.

1. Introduction

Entanglement, a property at the heart of Quantum Mechanics, has ﬁrst been
brought to scientiﬁc debate by the intriguing questions posed by Einstein, Podol-
sky, and Rosen 1 and since then the matter has always been under investigation.
Several years ago, the interest of the physical community in this counterintuitive
property has been raised even more due to its potential as a resource for informa-
tion processing and quantum computation 2. The growing interest in the area of
quantum information opened questions also in mathematics as well as propelled the
development of high precision experiments in several areas of physics (condensed

matter, quantum optics, and atomic physics) just to quote a few. In order to realize
the goal of quantum computation several important issues must be addressed. It
thus has become clear that the search for entangled states or classes of entangled
states constitutes an important subject. Clearly understanding systems involving
many entangled degrees of freedom is also an important part of quantum computa-
tion. Therefore, much work has been devoted to the subject in the recent literature
3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. In 3 is presented a scheme to experimental detection of gen-
uine multipartite entanglement using entanglement witness operators. This method
was applied to three and four-qubit entangled states of polarized photons, giving
experimental evidence that the considered states contain true multipartite entangle-
ment. Multipartite qubit systems have also been considered in 4,5,6. Relevant new
features appearing in multipartite systems as compared to bipartite measures are
highlighted together with an outline of how to experimentally measure multipartite
entanglement 7,8,9. A notion of generalized concurrence called genuine multipartite
entanglement (GME) concurrence 10,11 was introduced in the attempt to distin-
guish between GME and partial entanglement and it was pointed out that GME
concurrence of pure states may be directly accessible in laboratory experiments.
Many-particle systems, as far as their entanglement, are presented in Ref. 12 and
a brief review of the bipartite measures of entanglement and the entanglement of
pairs both for systems of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles are shown.
In this reference the concept of genuine multipartite entanglement is introduced and
an approach for the construction of genuine multipartite entanglement measures is
presented. Solid mathematical results regarding multipartite entanglement are only
available for pure three-qubit systems 13. In this case the existence of what is called
residual entanglement, not detectable by two-qubit entanglement quantiﬁers, has
been proved 14,15. To the residual entanglement, in Ref. 16, was showed that in
any arbitrary three partitions of a many-body system a residual entanglement is
always present. In this context there appears two very distinct regimes governed by
the overlap between the states in the superposition.

In this work we will extend the discussion that was began in the Ref. 16 to deal
with the dynamics of the concurrence of a many-body system. In that previous
paper, the discussion was focused in the residual entanglement between the parti-
tions of the system. Similar to Ref. 16, the purpose of the present contribution is
to shed some light on the dynamical properties of entanglement. In this paper, we
will study the dynamics among the environment oscillators. We will show that even
without a direct interaction among the environment oscillators, they entangle with
one another.

2. The model

We consider a system constituted by a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to N
other oscillators; see Fig. (1). The Hamiltonian is given by

H = ω0a†a + X

k

ωkb†kbk + X

k

γk(cid:0)a†bk + ab†k(cid:1),

(1)

where the operators a (a†) and bk (b†k) correspond to annihilation (creation) oper-
ators of the main oscillator and of the environment oscillator, respectively. ω0, ωk
correspond to the frequency of the main oscillator and of the environment oscilla-
tor. The symbol γk is a coupling constant between the main oscillator and the kth
oscillator of the environment with k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N .

Fig. 1. Model for a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to N other oscillators. The circle in A side
represents the main oscillator, which is coupled to a large number of the environment oscillator
(B side ) with diﬀerent frequencies ωk via the coupling constants γk.

3. Dynamics

3.1. Dynamics of the system

As the ﬁrst step to solve exactly the Hamiltonian above, in higher-dimensional
quantum systems, we will consider the initial state of the main oscillator in a
coherent state |α(0)i and each given oscillator of the environment in the vacuum
state |0k(0)i. The initial state of the global system in this manner is given by

|ψ(0)i = |α(0)iY

k

|0k(0)i.

For any time later the state of the system has the form

|ψ(t)i = |α(t)iY

k

|λk(t)i,

where |α(t)i and |λk(t)i are coherent states for any time later of the main oscillator
and of the environment respectively. The dynamic of the amplitudes α(t) and λk(t)
can be obtained by using (3) in the Schr¨odinger equation

i

d
dt|ψ(t)i = H|ψ(t)i.

(4)

By using the equation given by Eq. (3) and developing the left side of the
Schr¨odinger equation we obtain the following set of equations:

i

d
dt

f (t) = X

k

γkgk(t),

i

d
dt

gk(t) = −2δkgk(t) + γkf (t),

where we express α(t) and λk(t) in the form

α(t) = α(0)e−iω0tf (t),
λk(t) = α(0)e−iωktgk(t)e−2iδk t.

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

In the set of equations above f (t) and gk(t) are amplitudes that contain information
about the number of the excitations in each subsystems and δk = (cid:0)ω0 − ωk(cid:1)/2 is
a detuning between the main oscillator and the environment oscillators. To under-
stand the meaning of f (t) and gk(t) we will discuss the distribution of excitations
between the main oscillator and of the environment.

3.2. Dynamics of excitations

The unitary evolution given by the Hamiltonian (1) preserves the total excitation
number and therefore the number of excitation in the main oscillator plus the
excitations in the N other will be conserved throughout evolution. In order to
discuss the dynamics of excitations we will consider the initial state of the main
oscillator in a coherent state |α(0)i and each given oscillator of the environment
in the vacuum state |0k(0)i. The initial excitation number average of the global
system in this manner is given by

¯Nexc(0) = hψ(0)|a†a|ψ(0)i.

(9)

For any time later there is some transfer of excitation between the main oscillator
and the environment and therefore the excitation number average of the global
system is given by

¯Nexc(t) = hψ(t)|a†a + X

k

b†kbk|ψ(t)i.

Using (7) and (8) it can be shown that

hψ(t)|a†a|ψ(t)i = hψ(0)|a†a|ψ(0)iΞ(t),

X

k

hψ(t)|b†kbk|ψ(t)i = hψ(0)|a†a|ψ(0)iΘ(t),

(11)

(12)

with Ξ(t) = |f (t)|2 and Θ(t) = Pk |gk(t)|2. Using now (11) and (12) in (10) we
have

hψ(0)|(cid:16)a†a + Pk b†kbk(cid:17)|ψ(0)i

hψ(0)|a†a|ψ(0)i

= Ξ(t) + Θ(t).

(13)

Recalling that the initial state of the system is given by |ψ(0)i = |α(0)iQk |0ki,
consequently we obtain Ξ(t)+Θ(t) = 1 in the right side of Eq. (13). The parameters
Ξ(t) and Θ(t) contain information about the normalized number of the excitation
in each subsystem. In fact, one may say that the system dynamic is completely
given by these parameters and the initial state of the system. To estimate these
parameters we need to solve the set of equations given by (5) and (6).

From now on, the system of units is chosen so that ω0 = 1, and the values of all
physical quantities below are given with respect to this system. The environment
is composed of a set of oscillators with equally spaced frequencies ωk varying in the
range from 0.5ω0 to 1.5ω0, see Fig. (2), and the coupling constant γk = 0.1√N
. In
the distribution shown in Fig. (2) there is at least one oscillation of environment
in resonance with the main oscillator (ω0 = ωk). In Fig. (3), we show the exchange
of excitation between the main oscillator and the environment. As expected, the
environment removes all excitations of the main oscillator. Note that, the curve
of the main oscillator resembles an exponential decay, like a typical Markovian
behavior, where the system of interest loses excitation to the environment without
recovering them. The two curves are complementary so that their sum is equal to
1, agreeing thereby with the conservation of number of excitations.

3.3. Excitations of the environment

In dynamics described by Fig. (3) it shows that after some time the environment
removes all excitations of the main oscillator. So, we hope that, the interaction
between the main oscillator and the environment creates correlations among the
environment oscillators. We will now discuss the excitations in the environment
and to do so we divide the environment into multiple partitions and after that we
will see how the excitations are distributed among these partitions. We divide the
environment into 10 partitions with 100 oscillators each. In each partition half of
the oscillators has a higher frequency, while the other half has a low frequency in
comparison to frequency of the main oscillator. Figure (4) shows how this partition
was made and Fig. (5) shows how the excitations evolves in these partitions. Initially
there are some oscillations that occur because during this time the main excitation
oscillator exchange with the environment. Therefore, while the excitations are being
distributed to the environment oscillators, these ones exchange excitations with each
other through the main oscillator. After that, all excitations are transferred to the
environment, the system is stabilized and there are not exchange of excitations.
Therefore, the average number of excitations for each partition is constant.

Fig. 4. The ﬁgure illustrate as was divided the environment. It was divided into 10 partitions with
100 oscillators each. In each partition half of the oscillators has a higher frequency, while the other
half has a low frequency in comparison to frequency of the main oscillator.

time ω0t. Each partition i contains 100 oscillators where the half of the oscillators has a higher
frequency, while the other half has a low frequency in comparison to frequency of the main oscilla-
tor. The ﬁgure describe Θi with i = 1, 2, . . . , 10 partitions of the environment from top to bottom
respectively.

4. Concurrence among the environment oscillators

Until now we have studied the dynamics of the system. It was obtained the equa-
tions of motion and calculated the Ξ(t) e Θ(t) functions. We discussed how the
excitations are transferred from the main oscillator to the environment and how
they are distributed in the environment after that the system is stabilized. In dy-
namics described by Fig. (3) it shows that after some time the environment removes
all excitations of the main oscillator and Fig. (5) shows how the excitations evolves
in the partitions of the environment. Since that all the excitations are contained
in the environment we hope that there is some entanglement between the environ-
ment partitions. Thus, we can study the dynamics of entanglement between the
environment partitions. In order to investigate the dynamics of entangled states we
will consider the initial state of the system given by
|Ψ(0)i = N(cid:0)a|α(0)i + b|β(0)i(cid:1)Y

|0k(t)i

(14)

k

with the initial state of the main oscillator in a coherent superposition of coherent
states and each oscillator of the environment in a vacuum state. The parameters a
and b are arbitrary complex number and N is a normalization constant given by
(15)

N −1 = p|a|2 + |b|2 + a∗bhα(0)|β(0)i + ab∗hβ(0)|α(0)i.

The time evolution of this initial state (14) is given by

|Ψ(t)i = N(cid:0)a|α(t)i|λ(t)i + b|β(t)i|χ(t)i(cid:1)

with

|λ(t)i = Y

Due to the linearity of the Schr¨odinger equation, the labels (α(t), β(t)) will obey
Eq. (5) and (λk(t), χk(t)) will obey Eq. (6) in the form given by Eqs. (7) and (8).
For an arbitrary time t the system becomes entangled in any bipartition.

To discuss the distribution of the dynamics of entanglement among the various
possible partitions of the system we will calculate the density matrix of the system
given by

ρ(s,r) = N 2n|a|2|α(t), λ(t)ihα(t), λ(t)| + |b|2|β(t), χ(t)ihβ(t), χ(t)|

+ (cid:2)ab∗|α(t), λ(t)ihβ(t), χ(t)| + H.c(cid:3)o,

(18)

where H.c. is the Hermitian conjugate and as described above, the state |α(t)i and
|β(t)i (|λ(t)i and |χ(t)i) are states of the main oscillator (environment). From Eq.
(18) we can easily obtain the density matrix corresponding to the oscillators of
environment. To do this, we will just take the partial trace over the main oscillator.
We get

ρ(r) = N 2n|a|2|λ(t)ihλ(t)| + |b|2|χ(t)ihχ(t)| +
(cid:2)ab∗hβ(0)|α(0)iΞ(t)|λ(t)ihχ(t)| + H.c.(cid:3)o,

(19)

where was using hβ(t)|α(t)i = hβ(0)|α(0)iΞ(t). Writing the state of the environment
as a product of two partitions (B and C) (see Eq. (17)), so that:

|λ(t)i = |λBi ⊗ |λCi,
|χ(t)i = |χBi ⊗ |χCi.

(20)

We can now write the reduced density matrix for the environment partitions as:

ρ(B,C) = N 2n|a|2|λB, λCihλB, λC| + |b|2|χB, χCihχB, χC|
+ (cid:2)ab∗hβ(0)|α(0)iΞ(t)|λB, λCihχB, χC| + H.c.(cid:3)o.

(21)

In order to characterize this entanglement we will rewrite the concurrence used by
Wootters to describe entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two qubit
15 in terms of distinguishability of the states of systems. However, we are working
with coherent states, which are non-orthogonal states. To obtain the concurrence
in this case we have to write these states in terms of an orthonormal base [see Eq.
(A.19) in Appendix]. From Eq.(21) the concurrence can be write in the form

C(B,C) = 2|ab|N 2|hα(0)|β(0)i|Ξ(t)DBDC

(22)

where DB (DC ) is the distinguishability of the state |λBi and |χBi (|λCi and |χCi)
of the partition B (partition C) of the environment. The function Di is a reﬂex
of ”distinguishability” between the states |µii and |νii and if the overlap between
the states |µii and |νii is close to unity the distinctness comes close to zero and

the concurrence which is directly proportional to this tends to disappear 17. The
distinguishability between two coherent states can be written as

From (11) and (12)

DB = p1 − |hλB|χBi|2,
DC = p1 − |hλC|χCi|2.

|hλB|χBi|2 = |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘB ,
|hλC|χCi|2 = |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘC .

In this case, the concurrence is given by

CB,C = 2|ab|N 2|hα(0)|β(0)i|Ξ(t)q1 − |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘB

q1 − |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘC .

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

Note that, in the Eq.(27) there is a term in the expression of concurrence that refers
to a subsystem which is outside of the system of interest. The external contribution
term involves the Ξ(t) that is directly related to the dynamics of excitations of the
main oscillator. According to Eq. (27), the concurrence depends on the functions
ΘB and ΘC . These functions are related to the dynamics of excitations of the
partitions B and C respectively, and therefore, vary with the number of oscillators
and the frequency band of each partition. We will analyze the case where the
partition B is centered on the frequency of the main oscillator, while the partition
C is complementary to the ﬁrst. Figure (6) illustrates how this division has been
made and the ﬁgures (7)-(9) show how the excitations vary in these partitions.

Fig. 6. The ﬁgure illustrate the set of oscillators of the environment, the partitions B, centered
at the resonance frequency of the main oscillator A, and the partition C is complementary to the
partition B.

In Fig. (10) we plot the evolution of the concurrence to the cases above and it
may be observed that in the case that the partition B contains 100 oscillators the
system gets entangled much more than in the case that the partition B contains 900
oscillators. To understand this behavior, we will return to concurrence expression.
Since we are interested in the situation where all excitation are contained in the
environment, Ξ(T ) = 0, the Eq. (27) reduces to the form:

CB,C = 2|ab|N 2q1 − |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘBq1 − |hα(0)|β(0)i|2ΘC .

Fig. 10. Evolution of the concurrence between the partition B and C as a function of the (dimen-
sionless) scaled time ω0t to the cases analyzed in ﬁgures (7)-(9) for hα0|β0i = e−18 and b = −a. In
the curve (a) the partition B contains 100 oscillators, (b) the partition B contains 500 oscillators
and (c) the partition B contains 900 oscillators.

If ΘB or ΘC are close to zero, the distinguishability is close to zero, therefore
the concurrence tends to zero. Looking at the case where the partition B contains
900 oscillators, we see through Fig. (9) that ΘC is near zero. So, in this case, the
distinguishability of the states of the oscillators partition C is small. Therefore, the
system state approaches a separable state. In this way, these two subsystems are
little tangled, as can seen in the (c) curve in Fig.(10). When ΘB is close to ΘC the
distinguishability approaches its maximum value. We see that in the cases studied,
the situation where the two functions appear to be closer is shown in Fig. (7),
where partition B contains 100 oscillators. As in this situation, the states of each
part of the environment are more distinguishable, the entanglement between the
two parties becomes greater (see the (a) curve in Fig.(10)). Note that, in accordance
with equation (28), in the case that ΘB = ΘC = 1
2 , the concurrence reaches the
value one. That is, if we could separate the environment into two parts, so that the
average number of excitations in each of the parts are equal, these two subsystems
are maximally entangled. We observed, in this situation, that entanglement was
maximum when each subsystem had the same average number of excitations.

Looking at Fig. (10), we see that the concurrence is constant after some time.
After this time, all the excitations are contained in the environment and the main
oscillator is in the vacuum state. When this happens, the system dynamics dies.
The system is stabilized and there is no exchange of excitations, even among the
environment oscillators. Therefore, the functions ΘB and ΘC remain constant, and
consequently the concurrence too. Note that initially the environment oscillator
were uncorrelated, there was no entanglement among them. When interacting with
the main oscillator, they correlate. So this interaction with the main oscillator
creates correlations among the environment oscillators. The superposition of the
initial state is transferred to the states of the environment oscillators making them
tangled.

5. Conclusions

It has been considered here a many-body system consisting of a harmonic oscillator
linearly coupled to N others and solved the corresponding dynamical problem ana-
lytically. The interaction between the main oscillator and the environment creates
correlations among the environment oscillators. Initially the environment oscillators
were uncorrelated, there was no entanglement among them. After the interaction,
the superposition of the initial state is transferred to the states of the environment
creates correlations among the environment oscillators. We have studied the dy-
namics of entanglement among of the environment oscillators . The entanglement
between any two environment partitions was quantiﬁed and it showed that in the
case that ΘB is close to ΘC the entanglement between the two parties becomes
greater. That is, if we could separate the environment into two parts, so that the
average number of excitations in each of the parts are equal, these two subsystems
are maximally entangled. We observed, in this situation, that entanglement was
maximum when each subsystem had the same average number of excitations.

Appendix. Getting the expression of the concurrence for coherent

states

In this Appendix, we will show the deduction of the concurrence for coherent states
used in this paper. To do this, we consider the arbitrary density matrix of a system
constituted of two subsystems A and B given by:

ρ = G (p|α, λihα, λ| + q|β, χihβ, χ| + z|α, λihβ, χ| + z∗|β, χihα, λ|) ,

(A.1)

where p, q, z and G are parameter of the system and {|αi,|βi} ({|λi,|χi}) are
coherent states of the subsystem A (B). In order to rewrite the concurrence used
by Wootters to describe entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two
qubit in terms of coherent states, which are non-orthonormal states, we have to
write these coherent states in terms of an orthonormal base. Order to do this, we
will consider the generic states 18

|fi = cos µ|α(t)i + eiθ sin µ|β(t)i,
|gi = − sin µ|α(t)i + eiθ cos µ|β(t)i,
with θ real. For that the states above are orthogonal µ = π
Normalizing these states

|hβ(t)|α(t)i|

.

=

|1i = |fi
phf|fi
|0i = |gi
phg|gi
. In a similar procedure we can write another pair of

1
2S+ (cid:0)|α(t)i + eiθ|β(t)i(cid:1) ,
1
2S− (cid:0)−|α(t)i + eiθ|β(t)i(cid:1) ,

(A.3)

with S± = q 1±|hα(t)|β(t)i|

orthonormal states taking into account the environment variables, ie:

(cid:16)|λ(t)i + eiθ ′
(cid:16)−|λ(t)i + eiθ ′

|χ(t)i(cid:17) ,
|χ(t)i(cid:17) ,

(A.4)

| ↑i =

| ↓i =

1
2S′+
1
2S′−
and eiθ ′

± = q 1±|hλ(t)|χ(t)i|

with S′
states in terms of these orthonormal states. So we obtain that

= hχ(t)|λ(t)i
|hχ(t)|λ(t)i|

2

. We can now write the coherent

|α(t)i = S+|1i − S−|0i,
|β(t)i = e−iθ (S+|1i + S−|0i) ,
|λ(t)i = S′+| ↑i − S′
−| ↓i,
|χ(t)i = e−iθ ′ (cid:0)S′+| ↑i + S′

−| ↓i(cid:1) .

(A.5)

The states {|1i,|0i} and {| ↑i,| ↓i} form a base for our system (qubits). Therefore,
for any instant in time, the system can be written as a pair of qubit. After this
change of base, we can calculate the concurrence between the two subsystems.

Having deﬁned the base of qubits for our system, we can now rewrite the con-
currence used by Wootters in terms of coherent states. The concurrence to describe
entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two qubit can be deﬁned as

C = max(0, l1 − l2 − l3 − l4)15, where li are the eigenvalues, in decreasing or-
der, of the Hermitian matrix R = p√ρ˜ρ√ρ. Here ˜ρ is obtain using the spin-ﬂip

transformation

˜ρ = σyρ∗σy = (σ1y ⊗ σ2y)ρ∗(σ1y ⊗ σ2y),

(A.9)
where ρ∗ is the complex conjugate of ρ and σy = σ1y ⊗ σ2y is the matrix’s Pauli
of the correspondent system. The concurrence can be write as C = max(0, 2lmax −
T r{R}) where T r{R} = T r{p√ρ˜ρ√ρ}. Using now √ρ = U√ρDU†, where ρD is

the diagonal form of ρ and U is the matrix that diagonalize ρ, we get:

T r{R} = T r{q√ρ˜ρ√ρ}

= T r{Uq√ρDU†p˜ρUq√ρDU†}
= T r{√ρDU†p˜ρU}
= T r{pρ˜ρ} = T r{

√M},

where M = ρ˜ρ. As T r{R} = Pi li, where li are the eigenvalues of R and T r{√M} =
Pi √mi, where mi are the eigenvalues of M , we obtain li = √mi. Therefore to ﬁnd

the expression of concurrence we have to obtain M and get its eigenvalues. To
obtain M , ﬁrst we need to calculate ˜ρ using the operation (A.9).
Now, write the matrix σy in the base given by (A.5) we have

σy = (−i|1ih0| + i|0ih1|) ⊗ (−i| ↑ih↓ | + i| ↓ih↑ |)
