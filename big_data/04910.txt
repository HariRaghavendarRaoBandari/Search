Abstract. We study Schatten–von Neumann properties of multiple operator integrals
with integrands in the Haagerup tensor product of L∞ spaces. We obtain sharp, best
possible estimates. This allowed us to obtain sharp Schatten–von Neumann estimates
in the case of Haagerup-like tensor products.

1. Introduction

Double operator integrals have been used in perturbation theory for 60 years. They
were introduced by Yu.L. Daletskii and S.G. Krein in [DK], where the authors studied
the problem of diﬀerentiability of operator functions and found a formula for operator
derivatives in terms of double operator integrals. Later Birman and Solomyak developed
in [BS1], [BS2], and [BS3] the beautiful theory of double operator integrals and applied
their theory to a variety of problems. Since that time double operator integrals were
successfully applied in perturbation theory on many occasions (see, e.g., [Pe1], [Pe2],
[AP2], [AP3], [APPS], [NP] and [PoS]).

It turned out that various problems of perturbation theory lead to multiple operator
integrals. Several mathematicians tried to give deﬁnitions of multiple operator integrals,
see [Pa], [St]. However, those deﬁnitions required very strong restrictions on the classes
of functions that can be integrated.
In [Pe3] multiple operator integrals were deﬁned
for functions that belong to the (integral) projective tensor product of L∞ spaces. Such

multiple operator integrals were used in the problem of evaluating higher operator deriva-
tives (see [Pe2] and [Pe3]), in estimating higher order operator diﬀerences (see [AP1] and
[AP2]). They also appeared in a natural way when studying various trace formulae for
functions of self-adjoint operators (see [AP3]).

Later in [JTT] multiple operator integrals were deﬁned for Haagerup tensor products
of L∞ spaces, which is broader that the projective tensor product of L∞ spaces. Nev-
ertheless, it turns out that multiple operator integrals deﬁned for the Haagerup tensor
products of L∞ spaces do not possess such natural Schatten–von Neumann classes as in
the case of projective tensor products.

Triple operator integrals played an important role recently in problems of estimat-
ing functions of noncommuting self-adjoint and unitary operators, see [ANP1], [ANP2],
In those papers new tensor products of L∞ spaces were
[ANP3], [AP4] and [AP5].
introduced (so-called Haagerup-like tensor products of the ﬁrst kind and and Haagerup-
like tensor products of the second kind) and triple operator integrals were deﬁned for
integrands that belong to such Haagerup-like tensor products.

Note that in [ANP1], [ANP2], [ANP3], [AP4] and [AP5] it was important to obtain
Schatten–von Neumann estimates of triple operator integrals with integrands belonging
to Haagerup and Haagerup-like tensor products of L∞ spaces.

We also mention here the recent survey article [Pe4] on multiple operator integrals in

perturbation theory.

Note that the anonymous referee of [ANP3] observed that the proof of the theorem
on Schatten–von Neumann properties of triple operator integrals with integrands in the
Haagerup tensor product of L∞ spaces can be simpliﬁed and the simpliﬁcation also allows
one to extend the result of [ANP3] to a broader range of Schatten–von Neumann ideals.
In this paper we obtain most general results on Schatten–von Neuman properties of
arbitrary multiple operator integrals with integrands belonging to Haagerup(-like) tensor
products of L∞ spaces and prove that these results are best possible.

2. An introduction to multiple operator integrals

In this section we recall the deﬁnition of triple operator integrals in the case when the
integrand belongs to the projective (or integral projective) tensor product of L∞ spaces.
Then we proceed to multiple operator integrals with integrands in the Haagerup tensor
product of L∞.

Let us ﬁrst consider, for simplicity, the case of triple operator integrals.
Let E1, E2, and E3 be spectral measures on Hilbert space and let T and R be bounded
linear operators on Hilbert space. Triple operator integrals are expressions of the follow-
ing form:

ZX1 ZX2 ZX3

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3).

(2.1)

Such integrals make sense under certain assumptions on Ψ, T , and R. The function Ψ
is called the integrand of the triple operator integral.

2

Recall that the projective tensor product L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗L∞(E3) can be deﬁned

as the class of function Ψ of the form

such that

kϕnkL∞(E1)kψnkL∞(E2)kχnkL∞(E3) < ∞.

ϕn(x1)ψn(x2)χn(x3)

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) =Xn
Xn

(2.2)

(2.3)

The norm kΨkL∞ ˆ⊗L∞ ˆ⊗L∞ of Ψ is, by deﬁnition, the inﬁmum of the left-hand side of
(2.3) over all representations of the form (2.2).

For Ψ ∈ L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗L∞(E3) of the form (2.2) the triple operator integral (2.1)

was deﬁned in [Pe3] by

ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3)

=Xn (cid:18)Z ϕn dE1(cid:19) T(cid:18)Z ψn dE2(cid:19) R(cid:18)Z χn dE3(cid:19) .

(2.4)

Clearly, (2.3) implies that the series on the right converges absolutely in the norm. The
right-hand side of (2.4) does not depend on the choice of a representation of the form
(2.2), see, e.g., [ACDS] and [Pe4]. Clearly,

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

Note that for Ψ ∈ L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗L∞(E3), triple operator integrals have the follow-
ing Schatten–von Neumann properties:

≤ kΨkL∞ ˆ⊗L∞ ˆ⊗L∞ kT k · kRk.

Here Sp, p > 0, stands for the Schatten–von Neumann ideal of operators on Hilbert
space. We refer the reader to [GK] for deﬁnitions and properties of such ideals.

Let us also mention that the deﬁnition of multiple operator integrals was extended in
[Pe3] for functions Ψ that belong to the so-called integral projective tensor product of the
corresponding L∞ spaces. We refer the reader to [Pe3] for more detail.

Practically the same deﬁnition can be given for multiple operator integrals of the form

Ψ(x1, · · · , xm) dE1(x1)T1 dE2(x2)T2 · · · Tm−1 dEm(xm).

Such multiple operator integrals can be deﬁned for functions Ψ in the projective ten-
sor product L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗ · · · ˆ⊗L∞(Em) as well as for Ψ in the integral projective
tensor (see [Pe3]).

We proceed now to the approach to multiple operator integrals based on the Haagerup
tensor product of L∞ spaces. We refer the reader to the book [Pi] for detailed information
about Haagerup tensor products.

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the Haagerup tensor product L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2) of two L∞ spaces

as the space of functions Ψ of the form

αj(x1)βj(x2), where {αj}j≥0 ∈ L∞

E1(ℓ2) and {βj}j≥0 ∈ L∞

E2(ℓ2),

(2.8)

The norm kΨkL∞⊗hL∞ is, by deﬁnition the inﬁmum of the products

over all representations of Ψ in the form of (2.8).

k{αj}j≥0kL∞(ℓ2)k{βj }j≥0kL∞(ℓ2)

Note that the space L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2) coincides with the space M(E1, E2) of Schur
multipliers with respect to E1 and E2 (see [Pe1] and [AP6]). For Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗hL∞(E2)

the double operator integral RR Ψ dE1T dE2 can be deﬁned by

ZZ Ψ(x1, x2) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2) =Xj (cid:18)Z αj dE1(cid:19) T(cid:18)Z βj dE2(cid:19) ,

the series on the right converges in the weak operator topology, its sum does not depend
on the choice of a representation of Ψ the form (2.8) and determines a bounded linear
transformer on the space B(H ) of bounded linear operators on H (see [BS1], [Pe1] and
[AP6]).

Let us proceed now to triple operator integrals with integrands in the Haagerup tensor
product of L∞ spaces. We deﬁne the Haagerup tensor product L∞(E1) ⊗h L∞(E2) ⊗h

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) = Xj,k≥0

αj(x1)βjk(x2)γk(x3),

(2.9)

where αj, βjk, and γk are measurable functions such that

{αj}j≥0 ∈ L∞

E1(ℓ2),

{βjk}j,k≥0 ∈ L∞

E2(B),

and {γk}k≥0 ∈ L∞

E3(ℓ2),

where B is the space of matrices that induce bounded linear operators on ℓ2 and this
space is equipped with the operator norm. In other words,

Clearly, the limit exists almost everywhere.

The norm of Ψ in L∞⊗hL∞ ⊗hL∞ is, by deﬁnition, the inﬁmum of

k{αj }j≥0kL∞(ℓ2)k{βjk}j,k≥0kL∞(B)k{γk}k≥0kL∞(ℓ2)

over all representations of Ψ of the form (2.9).

It is well known that L∞ ˆ⊗L∞ ˆ⊗L∞ ⊂ L∞ ⊗hL∞ ⊗hL∞, see e.g., [ANP3] and [Pe4].
In [JTT] multiple operator integrals were deﬁned for functions in the Haagerup tensor
product of L∞ spaces. Let Ψ ∈ L∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞ and suppose that (2.9) and (2.10) hold.
The triple operator integral (2.1) is deﬁned by

ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3)

= Xj,k≥0(cid:18)Z αj dE1(cid:19) T(cid:18)Z βjk dE2(cid:19) R(cid:18)Z γk dE3(cid:19)

Then the series in (2.11) converges in the weak operator topology, the sum of the
series does not depend on the choice of a representation (2.9), it determines a bounded
linear operator and

Quadruple operator integrals with integrands in the Haagerup tensor products of L∞

The fact that the deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of a representation (2.13)

can be proved in the same way as in the case of triple operator integrals.

In the next section we prove the boundedness property for multiple operator integrals

and study their Schatten–von Neumann properties.

3. Boundedness and Schatten–von Neumann properties of multiple operator

integrals

In [ANP2] and [ANP3] it was proved that if T1 ∈ Sp, T2 ∈ Sq, 1/r def= 1/p + 1/q ≤ 1/2,

and Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3), then

and

ZZZ Ψ dE1T1 dE2T2 dE3(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)S r

The anonymous referee of [ANP3] observed that the original proof in [ANP3] can be

simpliﬁed and the same conclusion holds under the weaker assumption max{p, q} ≥ 2.

In this section we obtain an analog of this result for arbitrary multiple operator inte-

grals. In the next section we show that our results are best possible.

In what follows by the expression T ∈ Sp in the case p = ∞ we mean that T is a

bounded linear operator.

and let Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗hL∞(E2)⊗h· · ·⊗hL∞(Em). Suppose that T2, · · · , Tm−2 are bounded
linear operators, T1 ∈ Sp, Tm ∈ Sq with p, q ∈ [2, ∞]. Then

In the next section we show that if we impose assumptions that T2, T3 · · · , Tm−2
belong to any operator ideals, this will not improve Schatten–von Neumann properties
of multiple operator integrals. Also, we learn in the next section that the statement of
the theorem is false if min{p, q} < 2.

Proof. To simplify the notation, we assume that m = 4. It will be clear that the

same reasoning will work for all other values of m.

Suppose that Ψ is given by (2.13), where

{αj}j≥0 ∈ L∞

We need the following lemma. It was the anonymous referee of [ANP3] who suggested

to use this fact.

Proof of Lemma 3.2. It suﬃces to prove the result for p = 2 and p = ∞, and use

Let Ψ be deﬁned by (4.1). We have

It is easy to verify that

Hence,

spectral measures E1, E2, and E3 as well as the functions αj and γj are deﬁned as in
the previous case.

Then there exist two sequences {cj} ∈ ℓp

Z such that

We deﬁne the operators T1 and T2 by

Clearly, T1 ∈ Sp1 and rank T2 = 1. Thus T2 ∈ Sp2. Put

j ∈ Z,

ζ ∈ T,

and

Clearly, Bje0 = ej, j ∈ Z.

Bj =Z βj dE2.

We have

Obviously,

PjT1BjT2Pj.

PjT1BjT2Pjej = PjT1BjT2ej = djPjT1Bje0 = djPjT1ej = cjdjej,

and it follows from (4.2) that

Suppose now that m = 4. Consider a function Ψ of the form

As in the case m = 3, we put H

def= L2(T) and consider the orthonormal basis {ej }j∈Z
def

by ej
f ∈ H .

The spectral measures E1 and E4 are deﬁned on the σ-algebra of all subsets of Z by

E1(∆) = E4(∆) =Xj∈∆

Pj,

while the spectral measures E2 and E3 are deﬁned on the σ-algebra of Lebesgue mea-
surable subsets of T by

E2(∆)f = E3(∆)f = χ∆f,

f ∈ L2(T).

As before, the vector-valued function α is deﬁned by

αj(m) =( 1,

0,

j = m,

j 6= m.

We assume that the matrix-valued functions {βjk} and {γkl} are diagonal, i.e., there are
sequences {βj} and {γk} of measurable functions such that

Put

We have

βjk =( βj,

j = k,

j 6= k,

Bj =Z βj dE2

and γkl =( γk, k = l,
and Γj =Z γj dE3.

k 6= l.

ZZZZ Ψ dE1T1 dE2T2 dE3T3 dE4 =Xj∈Z

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pj.

Deﬁne now the operator T2 by T2 = P0. Clearly, T2 has rank one, and so it belongs

to all Schatten–von Neumann classes.

Consider ﬁrst the case p1 ≥ 2 and p3 ≥ 2. Assume that Sr 6⊂ S. We can select

sequences {cj} ∈ ℓp1

Z and {dj} ∈ ℓp3

Z such that

cjdjPj 6∈ S.

(4.3)

Deﬁne the operators T1 and T3 by

Xj∈Z
T1 =Xj∈Z

cjPj

and T3 =Xj∈Z

djPj.

Clearly, T1 ∈ Sp1 and T3 ∈ Sp3.

It remains to deﬁne the functions βj and γj. Put

βj(ζ) = ζ j

and γj(ζ) = ζ

,

j ∈ Z,

ζ ∈ T.

Then

and Γjek = ej−k,
Clearly, the operators Bj and Γj are unitary. We have

Bjek = ej+k

j, k ∈ Z.

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pjej = PjT1BjT2ΓjT3ej = djPjT1BjT2Γjej

= djPjT1BjT2e0 = djPjT1Bje0 = djPjT1ej = cjdjPj.

Thus

Xj∈Z

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pj =Xj∈Z

cjdjPj 6∈ S.

Suppose now that p1 ≥ 2 and p3 ≤ 2. Then p♯
Z and {dj} ∈ ℓ2

We can select sequences {cj} ∈ ℓp1

1 = p1 and p♯
Z such that (4.3) holds.

3 = 2. Assume that Sr 6⊂ S.

We deﬁne the operators T1 and T3 by

T1 =Xj∈Z

cjPj

and T3ej = dje0, j ∈ Z.

Clearly, T1 ∈ Sp1, T3 has rank one, and so T3 ∈ S2.

12

Finally, we put

βj(ζ) = ζ j

and γj(ζ) = 1,

j ∈ Z,

ζ ∈ T.

Then Bjek = ej+k, j, k ∈ Z, and Γj is the identity operator for all j ∈ Z.

We have

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pjej = PjT1BjT2ΓjT3ej = djPjT1BjT2Γje0

= djPjT1BjT2e0 = djPjT1Bje0 = djPjT1ej = cjdjPjej = cjdjej,

and so

Xj∈Z

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pj =Xj∈Z

cjdjPj 6∈ S.

The case p1 ≤ 2 and p3 ≥ 2 can be reduced to the case p1 ≥ 2 and p3 ≤ 2 by taking

the adjoint operator.

To complete the proof, it remains to consider the case p1 ≤ 2 and p3 ≤ 2. Then
p♯
1 = p♯
3 = 2. In this case r = 1. Assume that S1 6⊂ S. Again, we can select a sequence
{dj} of real numbers in ℓ2

j Pj 6∈ S.

We deﬁne the operators T1 and T3 by

Z such that Pj∈Z d2

T f = (f, e0)v

and Rf = (f, v)e0, f ∈ H , where

v =Xj∈Z

djej.

The functions βj and γj are deﬁned by

βj(ζ) = 1

and γj(ζ) = 1,

j ∈ Z,

ζ ∈ T.

In other words, Bj and Γj are equal to the identity operator on H for j ∈ Z.

We have

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pjej = PjT1BjT2ΓjT3ej = djPjT1BjT2Γje0

= djPjT1BjT2e0 = djPjT1Bje0 = djPjT1e0 = cjdjPjej = cjdjej,

and so

Xj∈Z

PjT1BjT2ΓjT3Pj =Xj∈Z

cjdjPj 6∈ S1. (cid:4)

5. Haagerup-like tensor products and multiple operator integrals

In [ANP3] we realized that to obtain Lipschitz type estimates for functions of noncom-
muting self-adjoint operators under perturbation, we need triple operator integrals with
integrands that do not belong to the Haagerup tensor product of three L∞ spaces. In
[AP5] we encountered the same problem to obtain almost commuting functional calculus
for almost commuting operators. It turned out that the problems can be overcome if
instead of the Haagerup tensor product we use Haagerup-like tensor products that were
introduced in [ANP1], [ANP2], [ANP3], [AP4] and [AP5].

13

We obtained in [ANP3] Shatten–von Neumann estimates for triple operator integrals
In this

with integrands that belong to Haagerup-like tensor products of L∞ spaces.
section we improve the estimates obtained in [ANP3] and obtain best possible results.

We also introduce Haagerup-like tensor products of L∞ spaces for an arbitrary num-
ber of spaces and obtain sharp Shatten–von Neumann estimates for the corresponding
multiple operator integrals.

Let us start with the case of three L∞ spaces.

Deﬁnition 1. A function Ψ is said to belong to the Haagerup-like tensor product

L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3) of the ﬁrst kind if it admits a representation

αj(x1)βk(x2)γjk(x3),

xj ∈ Xj,

(5.1)

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) = Xj,k≥0

with {αj }j≥0, {βk}k≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2) and {γjk}j,k≥0 ∈ L∞(B). As usual,

kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞

the inﬁmum being taken over all representations of the form (5.1).

def

= inf(cid:13)(cid:13){αj}j≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){βk}k≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){γjk}j,k≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(B),

Let us now deﬁne triple operator integrals whose integrand belong to the tensor prod-

uct L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3).

Let 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. For Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3), for a bounded linear operator

R, and for an operator T of class Sp, we deﬁne the triple operator integral

W =ZZ Z Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3)

(5.2)

as the following continuous linear functional on Sp′, 1/p + 1/p′ = 1 (on the class of
compact operators in the case p = 1):

Q 7→ trace(cid:18)(cid:18)ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE2(x2)R dE3(x3)Q dE1(x1)(cid:19) T(cid:19) .

(5.3)

Clearly, the triple operator integral in (5.3) is well deﬁned because the function

(x2, x3, x1) 7→ Ψ(x1, x2, x3)

belongs to the Haagerup tensor product L∞(E2)⊗hL∞(E3)⊗hL∞(E1). It follows easily
from Theorem 3.1 that

kW kS p ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kT kS pkRk,

1 ≤ p ≤ 2.

It is easy to see that in the case when Ψ belongs to the projective tensor product
L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗L∞(E3), the deﬁnition of the triple operator integral given above is
consistent with the deﬁnition of the triple operator integral given in (2.4). Indeed, it
suﬃces to verify this for functions Ψ of the form

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) = ϕ(x1)ψ(x2)χ(x3), ϕ ∈ L∞(E1), ψ ∈ L∞(E2), χ ∈ L∞(E3),

in which case the veriﬁcation is obvious.

We also need triple operator integrals in the case when T is a bounded linear operator

and R ∈ Sp, 1 ≤ p ≤ 2.

14

Deﬁnition 2. A function Ψ is said to belong to the Haagerup-like tensor product

L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3) of the second kind if Ψ admits a representation

Ψ(x1, x2, x3) = Xj,k≥0

αjk(x1)βj(x2)γk(x3)

(5.4)

where {βj}j≥0, {γk}k≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2), {αjk}j,k≥0 ∈ L∞(B). The norm of Ψ in the space
L∞ ⊗hL∞ ⊗hL∞ is deﬁned by

kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞

the inﬁmum being taken over all representations of the form (5.4).

def

= inf(cid:13)(cid:13){αj}j≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){βk}k≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){γjk}j,k≥0(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(B),

Suppose now that Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗hL∞(E2)⊗hL∞(E3), T is a bounded linear operator,

and R ∈ Sp, 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. The continuous linear functional

Q 7→ trace(cid:18)(cid:18)ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE3(x3)Q dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)(cid:19) R(cid:19)

on the class Sp′ (on the class of compact operators in the case p = 1) determines an
operator W of class Sp, which we call the triple operator integral

W = ZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3) dE1(x1)T dE2(x2)R dE3(x3).

(5.5)

Moreover,

kW kSp ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞ kT k · kRkS p.

As above, in the case when Ψ ∈ L∞(E1) ˆ⊗L∞(E2) ˆ⊗L∞(E3), the deﬁnition of the
triple operator integral given above is consistent with the deﬁnition of the triple operator
integral given in (2.4).

We deduce from Theorem 3.1 the following Schatten–von Nemann properties of the
triple operator integrals introduced above. The following result improves Theorem 5.1
of [ANP3].

Theorem 5.1. Let Ψ ∈ L∞ ⊗h L∞ ⊗h L∞. Suppose that T ∈ Sp and R ∈ Sq, where
def
= 1/p + 1/q ∈ [1/2, 1]. Then the operator W in (5.2) belongs to Sr and

q ≥ 2 and 1/r

kW kS r ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kT kS pkRkS q .

(5.6)

Proof. Let Φ be the function deﬁned by

Φ(x2, x3, x1) = Ψ(x1, x2, x3).

Clearly, the norm of W in Sr is the norm of the linear functional (5.3) on Sr′ (on the

class of compact operators if r = 1). We have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
trace(cid:18)(cid:18)ZZZ Ψ dE2R dE3Q dE1(cid:19) T(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ kT kS p(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ZZZ Ψ dE2R dE3Q dE1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)S

p′

(in the case when p = 1 we have to replace the norm in Sp′ on the right-hand side of the
inequality with the operator norm). Since q ≥ 2 and r′ ≥ 2, it follows from Theorem 3.1

15

that

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
ZZZ Ψ dE2R dE3Q dE1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)S

p′

=(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ZZZ Φ(x2, x3, x1) dE2(x2)R dE3(x2)Q dE1(x1)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)S

≤ kΦkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kRkS q kQkS

r′

p′

= kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kRkS q kQkS

r′ ,

which implies (5.6). (cid:4)

In the same way we can prove the following theorem, which improves Theorem 5.2 of

[ANP3]:

Theorem 5.2. Let Ψ ∈ L∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞. Suppose that p ≥ 2 and 1/r

def
= 1/p + 1/q ∈
[1/2, 1]. If T ∈ Sp, R ∈ Sq, then the operator W in (5.5) belongs to Sr, 1/r = 1/p + 1/q,
and

kW kS r ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kT kS pkRkS q .

We are going to introduce now Haagerup-like tensor products of L∞ spaces for m

spaces, where m ≥ 3. To avoid complicated notation, consider the case m = 4.

Deﬁnition 3. A function Ψ is said to belong to the Haagerup-like tensor product

L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3)⊗h L∞(E4) of the ﬁrst kind if it admits a representation

αl(x1)βj (x2)γjk(x3)δkl(x4),

xj ∈ Xj,

(5.7)

Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4) = Xj,k,l≥0

with {αl}l≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2), {βj}j≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2), {γjk}j,k≥0 ∈ L∞(B) and {δkl}k,l≥0 ∈ L∞(B).
As usual,

kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞

the inﬁmum being taken over all representations of the form (5.7).

def= inf(cid:13)(cid:13){αl}(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){βj}(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(ℓ2)(cid:13)(cid:13){γjk}(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(B)(cid:13)(cid:13){δkl}(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(B),

Let us now deﬁne triple operator integrals whose integrands belong to the tensor

product L∞(E1)⊗hL∞(E2)⊗hL∞(E3)⊗hL∞(E4).

Let 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. For Ψ ∈ L∞(E1) ⊗h L∞(E2) ⊗h L∞(E3) ⊗h L∞(E4), for a bounded
linear operators T2 and T3, and for an operator T1 of class Sp1, we deﬁne the quadruple
operator integral

W =ZZZ Z Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4) dE1(x1)T1 dE2(x2)T2 dE3(x3)T3 dE4(x4)

(5.8)

as the following continuous linear functional on S
compact operators in the case p1 = 1):

, 1/p1 + 1/p′

p′

1 = 1 (on the class of

Q 7→ trace(cid:18)(cid:18)ZZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4)dE2(x2)T2dE3(x3)T3dE4(x4)QdE1(x1)(cid:19)T1(cid:19) . (5.9)

Clearly, the quadruple operator integral in (5.9) is well deﬁned because the function

(x2, x3, x4, x1) 7→ Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4)

16

Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4) = Xj,k,l≥0

αjk(x1)βkl(x2)γl(x3)δj(x4),

belongs to the Haagerup tensor product L∞(E2) ⊗h L∞(E3) ⊗h L∞(E4) ⊗h L∞(E1). It
follows easily from Theorem 3.1 that

kW kSp ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞ kT1kSp1 kT2k · kT3k,

1 ≤ p ≤ 2.

It is easy to see that the deﬁnition of the triple operator integral given above is

consistent with the deﬁnition of the triple operator integral given in (2.4).

Similarly we can deﬁne the Haagerup like tensor product of the second kind.
The Haagerup-like tensor product L∞(E1) ⊗h L∞(E2) ⊗h L∞(E3) ⊗h L∞(E4) of the
second kind is deﬁned as the space of functions Ψ that admit a representation of the
form

where {γl}l≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2), {δj}j≥0 ∈ L∞(ℓ2), {αjk}j,k≥0 ∈ L∞(B) and {βkl}k,l≥0 ∈
L∞(B).

In this case the quadruple operator integral

W = ZZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4) dE1(x1)T1 dE2(x2)T2 dE3(x3)T3 dE4(x4)

is deﬁned as the following linear functional:

(5.10)

Q 7→ trace(cid:18)T3(cid:18)ZZZZ Ψ(x1, x2, x3, x4)dE4(x4)QdE1(x1)T1dE2(x2)T2dE3(x3)(cid:19)(cid:19) .

The following results hold:

Theorem 5.3. 1). Let Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3)⊗h L∞(E4). Suppose that
def
= 1/p1 + 1/p2 ∈ [1/2, 1]. Then the quadruple

T1 ∈ Sp1, T2 ∈ Sp2 , where p2 ≥ 2 and 1/r
operator integral (5.8) belongs to Sr and

kW kS r ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kT1kS p1 kT2kSp2 .

2). Let Ψ ∈ L∞(E1)⊗h L∞(E2)⊗h L∞(E3)⊗h L∞(E4). Suppose that T1 ∈ Sp1 and
def
= 1/p1 + 1/p2 ∈ [1/2, 1]. Then the quadruple operator

T3 ∈ Sp3, where p1 ≥ 2 and 1/r
integral (5.10) belongs to Sr and

kW kS r ≤ kΨkL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞⊗hL∞kT1kS p1 kT3kSp3 .

The proof of the theorem is practically the same as the proofs of Theorem 5.1 and

Theorem 5.2.
