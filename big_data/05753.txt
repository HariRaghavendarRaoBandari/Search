Enhanced violation of the Lorentz invariance and Einstein’s equivalence principle in

nuclei and atoms

Local Lorentz Invariance violating (LLIV) and Einstein equivalence principle violating (EEPV)
eﬀects in atomic experiments are discussed. The LLIV and EEPV eﬀects are strongly enhanced in
the narrow 7.8 eV transition in 229
90 Th nucleus. Nuclear LLIV tensors < cab(p2δab − 3papb)/6m > are
expressed in terms of the experimental values of nuclear quadrupole moments. There is signiﬁcant
enhancement in nuclei where the quadrupole moments and LLIV tensors have collective nature.
Calculations for nuclei of experimental interest 21
4Be and
54 Xe have been performed. The results for 21
10Ne are used to improve the limits on the proton LLIV
constants by 5 orders of magnitude and on the neutron LLIV constants by 1 order of magnitude.

Measurements of the Local Lorentz Invariance Vio-
lation (LLIV) eﬀects is a very popular direction of the
search for physics beyond the Standard Model (see, e.g.
[1–4]). The LLIV eﬀects are usually classiﬁed using no-
tations of the works [1, 5–8] coming under the name of
the Standard Model Extension (SME), and below we will
use these notations.

Spacial scalar LLIV interaction. Let us start
from the term violating Lorentz invariance and Ein-
stein’s equivalence principle (EEPV) which in the non-
relativistic limit is presented as

δH = −(cid:18)C(0)

0 −

2Ug

3c2 c00(cid:19) p2

2m

,

(1)

where p is the momentum, c is the speed of light, and
Ug is the Newtonian gravitational potential. This poten-
tial Ug depends on the distance from Earth to Sun and
oscillates with the period of one year due to the elliptic-
ity of the Earth orbit. The amplitude of the oscillations
∆Ug/c2 = 1.7 · 10−10. Corresponding shift in a transition
frequency δω due to the perturbation (1) allows one to
extract the limit on c00. To measure c00 we should con-
sider transitions where the kinetic energy p2/2m changes.
Using the virial theorem for the Coulomb interaction we
obtain the diﬀerence of kinetic energies between the ﬁnal
and initial states

− (< p2/2me >f − < p2/2me >i) = ¯hω .

(2)

However, the relativistic corrections violate the non-
relativistic relation in Eq. (2), i.e. the eﬀect does not
vanish for the transition frequency ω tends to zero. This
way we get a relative enhancement of the eﬀect δω/ω
when ω is very small [9]. This is the case for the ex-
periment Ref. [9] where the transition frequency ω + δω
between nearly degenerate levels of Dy atom has been
measured and the limit on c00 in the electron sector has
been extracted.

Note that the relativistic corrections in Dy and other
heavy atoms are not small, ∼ Z 2α2 ∼ 1. Use of the
relativistic form cγ0γjpj and the non-relativistic form
p2/2me (1) of the LLIV operator gives practically the

same result if we use the same relativistic wave func-
tions [9, 10]. The relativistic corrections are actually
dominated by the relativistic corrections to the electron
energies and wave functions which contribute when we
calculate the matrix element of the perturbation (1) (or
cγ0γjpj) and the energy diﬀerence in (2). As a result,
the LLIV frequency shift in heavy atoms has no any sup-
pression for the small frequency ω.

To have larger values of the scalar and tensor LLIV
eﬀects in Ref. [10] we proposed to use 4f − 6s transition
in Yb+ ion where deep f -electrons have larger kinetic
energy. Even larger enhancement is expected in heavy
highly charged ions where < p2/2me > has an addi-
tional enhancement (Zi + 1)2, where Zi is the ion charge.
The problem here is that the transition frequencies also
become very large, ∼ (Zi + 1)2, and go out of the laser
spectroscopy range.
[12–17] we found a solu-
tion for this problem: we predicted crossing points of the
electron energies which appear for certain Z and Zi (the
aim was to use the crossing points to enhance eﬀects of
α variation). The existence of the crossing points and
4f − 5s transitions within the laser frequency range have
been conﬁrmed in the experiment [18] detecting spec-
tra of Ir16+, Ir17+ and Ir16+ ions. Calculations of the
LLIV and EEPV eﬀects enhanced near the energy cross-
ing points in highly charged ions will be published in a
separate paper [11].

In Ref.

In the present work we show that a signiﬁcantly larger
enhancement of the LLIV - EEPV eﬀect, ∼ 105 times,
may exist near the nuclear energy level ”crossing”, espe-
cially in the narrow 7.8 eV transition between the ground
state and ﬁrst excited state in 229Th nucleus. The reason
for the enhancement is that the nuclear (MeV) scale of
the kinetic energy diﬀerence < p2/2m >f − < p2/2m >i
is very large in comparison with the atomic (eV) scale
while the transition energy 7.8 eV in 229Th nucleus hap-
pens to be on the atomic scale and may be investigated
using laser spectroscopy.

Note that the previous purely gravitational limit on the
proton EEPV constant c00 = (0.20 ± 30) · 10−6 obtained
from the nuclear bound kinetic energy [19] is an order of
magnitude weaker then the limit on the electron EEPV

constant c00 = (0.14 ± 0.28) · 10−7 obtained from the Dy
atom spectroscopy [9]. This gives an additional incentive
to use the laser spectroscopy method to search for the
nuclear EEPV eﬀect.

Earlier we found that possible eﬀects of the space-time
variation of the fundamental constants such as the ﬁne
structure constants α, quark masses and the strong in-
teraction scale ΛQCD, are enhanced in the 229Th tran-
sition up to ﬁve orders of magnitude [28] (see also [29–
33]). Currently this transition is very intensely inves-
tigated both theoretically and experimentally. A brief
review with numerous references may be found in the
recent paper [20]. The latest transition energy measure-
ment gave ¯hω = 7.8(5) eV [21]. The estimated width is
∼ 10−3 − 10−4 Hz [20, 22]. In Refs. [23–26] it was sug-
gested to use this transition as a high precision nuclear
clock with a projected accuracy exceeding that of the
current atomic clocks by two orders of magnitude [24].
This transition may also be used to build a nuclear laser
[27].

Let us start from a simple analytical estimate of the
LLIV-EEPV eﬀect. The ground state of 229Th nucleus
is J P [N nzΛ] = 5/2+[633], i.e. the deformed oscillator
quantum numbers are N = 6, nz = 3, the projection
of the valence neutron orbital angular momentum on the
nuclear symmetry axis (internal z-axis) is Λ = 3, the spin
projection Σ = −1/2, and the total angular momentum
and the total angular momentum projection are J = Ω =
Λ + Σ = 5/2. The 7.8 eV excited state is J P [N nzΛ] =
3/2+[631], i.e. it has Λ = 1, Σ = 1/2 and J = Ω = 3/2.
To estimate the eﬀect of the perturbation (1) we should
ﬁnd the diﬀerence of the kinetic energies in the excited
and ground states. The energy of both states may be
described by an equation

E =<

p2
2mn

> + < U > +CΛΣ,

(3)

where mn is the neutron mass and the spin-orbit inter-
action constant in Th nucleus is C = −0.85 MeV [34].
In the simplest single-particle model the diﬀerence of the
spin-orbit energies between the excited ( Λ = 1, Σ = 1/2)
and the ground (Λ = 3, Σ = −1/2) states is 2C. The
many-body corrections reduce this diﬀerence to 1.2C [31].
In the oscillator potential the kinetic and potential en-
ergies are equal, < p2
2m >=< U >. This gives us an
estimate for the the diﬀerence of the neutron kinetic en-
ergies between the excited and ground states

< p2/2mn >exc − < p2/2mn >gr=
0.5(¯hω − 1.2C) = 0.5 M eV.

(4)

This simple analytical estimate shows that the Lorentz
invariance and Einstein equivalence principle violating
eﬀects Eq.(1) in 229Th nucleus may be 105 times larger
than in atoms. This estimate agrees with the sophisti-
cated many-body numerical calculations of the diﬀerence
of the kinetic energies in the excited and ground states
performed in Ref.
[32]. The problem is that ab initio

2

numerical calculations can not reproduce the extremely
small (compared to the nuclear scale MeV) energy diﬀer-
ence ¯hω =7.8 eV between the excited and ground states.
Also, the results depend on the speciﬁc form of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction used. The result of the most
complete calculation performed using the Hartree-Fock-
Bogolubov method (with the pairing included) and the
nucleon-nucleon interaction which gives the minimal cal-
culated energy diﬀerence between the excited and ground
states (¯hω =- 46 KeV) is

< p2/2mn >exc − < p2/2mn >gr= 0.954 M eV.

(5)

This is the neutron contribution. There is also the proton
contribution:

< p2/2mp >exc − < p2/2mp >gr= 0.233 M eV.

(6)

Thus both neutron and proton interaction constants c00
may be measured in 7.8 eV Th transition. We see that
the diﬀerence of the kinetic energies is signiﬁcantly larger
than the transition energy , i.e. we have the enhancement
of the eﬀect of the LLIV perturbation (1). However, for
another type of the nucleon-nucleon interaction (which
gives a larger energy diﬀerence, ¯hω =-74 KeV, and pre-
sumed to be less accurate) the diﬀerences of the kinetic
energies are an order of magnitude smaller than that in
Eqn. (5,6), though we still have a huge LLIV enhance-
ment.

The 7.8 eV transition may be investigated using high
precision laser spectroscopy methods, has a very small
width, extremely small black body radiation shift and
suppressed other systematic eﬀects (see e.g.
[24]). This
gives additional advantages. We conclude that this nu-
clear transition has a great potential for a laboratory
search for new physics.

A similar value < p2/2mn >exc − < p2/2mn >gr∼ 0.1
- 1 MeV is expected in 235U 73 eV transition. The laser
spectroscopy for this transition will be available soon [36].
Another possibility is M¨ossbauer transitions. However,
the frequencies in these transitions are larger, so the rel-
ative eﬀects will be smaller. The accuracy of the mea-
surements in the M¨ossbauer spectroscopy is also not as
high as in the laser spectroscopy.

Spacial tensor LLIV interaction. Now we con-
sider eﬀects of the tensor LLIV interaction cab(p2δab −
3papb)/6m. The limits on cab in the electron sector have
recently been obtained in Ref.
[9] and signiﬁcantly im-
proved in Ref. [37]. In the nuclear sector the best limits
are obtained in the ground state Zeeman and hyperﬁne
atomic transitions (see e.g. review [1]). Indeed, here we
do not need nuclear transitions since the energy shifts
produced by the tensor operators are diﬀerent for diﬀer-
ent angular momentum projections.

The aim of the present paper is to use nuclear cal-
culations for signiﬁcant improvement of the best limits
on the proton and neutron LLIV constants cab using ex-
isting experimental data [38] for 21
10Ne (see also previous
experiments [39–42]) and propose new experiments bas-
ing on the collective enhancement of LLIV tensor (which

is similar to the collective enhancement of the electric
quadrupole moment in deformed nuclei).

Let us start from simple estimates of the quadrupole
moment Q and the LLIV tensor δH in the Schmidt
(single-valence-nucleon) model. The calculations simi-
lar to the calculation of Q in the textbook [43] give the
following results:

where we use the standard notation C(2)
0 = cxx + cyy −
2czz for the LLIV tensor interaction coeﬃcient in the lab-
oratory frame with the quantisation axis along z, j is the
total angular momentum of the valence nucleon (equal to
the nuclear spin I). As usual, the expectation values are
taken for the maximal value of the angular momentum
projection, jz = Iz = I. Note that the results do not de-
pend on the valence nucleon orbital angular momentum
l (the expression for γw =< δH > /C(2)
[5]
agrees with our result after the substitution l = j ± 1/2).
The numerical estimates have been presented for the fol-
lowing values of the parameters. For the valence nucleon
< r2 >≈ (3/5)R2 = 0.9A2/3 fm2, where R = 1.2A1/3 fm
is the nuclear radius, A is the number of the nucleons
in the nucleus, barn=100 fm2=10−24 cm2. The depth
of the nuclear potential V0 ≈ 50 MeV [35]. The bind-
ing energy of the valence nucleon in medium and heavy
nuclei is 5 - 10 MeV. This gives us a square-well esti-
mate of the valence nucleon kinetic energy < p2/2m >≈
40 MeV. The relativistic parameter K =< p2 > /m2 in
this model is K=0.08. The oscillator model gives a close
value < p2/2m >= mω2
0R2/2 ≈
(3/5)V0 ≈ 30 MeV, K = 0.06.

0 < r2 > /2 = (3/5)mω2

The Schmidt model is not very accurate for the descrip-
tion of the experimental values of the electric quadrupole
moments Q (and the LLIV tensors). It predicts Q = 0
in nuclei of the experimental interest 21Ne, 9Be, 201Hg,
173
70 Yb and 131
54 Xe where the valence nucleon is neutron
while the experimental values of Q are actually large.
On the other hand, the experimental value of Q in 133Cs
is 40 times smaller than the Schmidt model value. To
solve this problem we suggest a semi-empirical approach.
Looking on the Eqs. (7) and (8) we see that the LLIV
tensor and the quadrupole moment are proportional to
each other. This proportionality relation actually does
not require applicability of the Schmidt model. Indeed,
we may use the following equations:

< 0|pa|n >= im < 0|[H, ra]|n >=
im(E0 − En) < 0|ra|n >

(9)

< 0|papb|0 >= Xn

0 < 0|rarb|0 >

(10)

where we have taken into account that in the oscillator
potential the operator ra and pa have matrix elements to
the next shell only, with |En − E0| = ω0 ≈ 40 MeV/A1/3
[35]. We may sum these relations over all nucleons in
the nucleus and link the total values of the LLIV tensor
and quadrupole moment, so the Schmidt single-valence-
nucleon model is not needed. To account for the many-
body corrections, one may use the experimental value of
the giant dipole resonance frequency En − E0 = ωD ≈ 79
MeV/A1/3 [35, 44] instead of the nuclear oscillator fre-
quency ω0 ≈ 40 MeV/A1/3 since this resonance saturates
the sum rule for the dipole transitions. Use of the gi-
ant dipole resonance frequency would lead to the 4 times
larger result. Instead we will use a very conservative es-
timate which coincides with the Schmidt model estimate
of the ratio < δH > /Q (see Eqs. (7) and (8)):

This relation allows us to use the experimental values of
the electric quadrupole moments presented in the tables
in Ref.
[45] to ﬁnd the proton LLIV interaction contri-
bution to the energy shifts.

Enhancement in nuclei with large collective
quadrupole moments. A half of all nuclei have en-
hanced nuclear electric quadrupole moment Q. From
Eq. (11) it follows that a similar enhancement should
exist for the tensor LLIV operator which is proportional
to Q. Another example is the enhanced time-reversal
violating nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment [46, 47].
This collective enhancement is produced by A2/3 nucle-
ons located in the external shells.

Eq.

(11) links the proton LLIV contribution to the
electric quadrupole moment. The neutron density dis-
tribution closely follows the proton density distribution.
Therefore, in the case of the deformed nuclei the neutron
quadrupole moment may be approximately expressed in
terms of the proton electric quadrupole moment, Qn =
(N/Z)Q. Then we may use Eq. (11) with an additional
factor N/Z, the ratio of the number of neutrons N to the
number of protons Z. This simple approach relies on the
collective nature of the quadrupole moments in deformed
nuclei.

Alternatively, one may use a microscopic approach to
ﬁnd the expectation values of the proton and neutron ten-
sor operators. Indeed, in the deformed nuclei the energies
of orbitals with the diﬀerent absolute values |M | of the
projections of the angular momentum on the nuclear axis
are split by the strong quadrupole ﬁeld. This makes sev-
eral external shells only partially ﬁlled, and about A2/3
nucleons contributing to the expectations values of the

tensor operators such as the electric quadrupole, mag-
netic quadrupole and LLIV tensor. It is important that
for the tensor operators contributions of equally popu-
lated degenerate orbitals with the opposite signs of the
angular momentum projections ±M add up. Therefore,
the collective quadrupole enhancement appears. For the
vector operators contributions of ±M cancel, and there is
no enhancement. We will explore this approach in a sep-
arate publication [48]. The ”microscopic” method of the
calculations is similar to that used for the calculations of
the collective nuclear magnetic quadrupole moments in
our papers [46, 47].

The LLIV tensor enhancement may be successfully ex-
plored in the experiments, for example, in the proposed
Yb+ experiment [10], since 173Yb nucleus has large elec-
tric quadrupole moment. Another important example of
the collective enhancement is 21Ne where the most accu-
rate LLIV experiments [38, 40] have been performed.

Numerical results and improved limits on the
tensor LLIV extracted from the experimental
data. Let us consider several most important examples.
The quadrupole moment of the deformed 173
70 Yb nucleus
is 2.80(4) barn, N/Z = 103/70 ≈ 1.5. Using Eq. (11) we
obtain the proton and neutron LLIV shifts:

173

70 Yb : < δH >= (C(2)

0,p + 1.5C(2)

0,n) · 100 MeV (12)

The collective enhancement for 173
70 Yb is over 20 times
since the Schmidt model values from Eqs. (7) and (8)
are Q = 0 for protons (i.e. no electric quadrupole) and
Q = −0.15 barn for neutron with j = 5/2, and < δH >=
−(0 · C(2)

0,n)·6 MeV.
10Ne also has a collective quadrupole mo-
ment Q =0.103(8) barn (vs the Schmidt value Q = 0
and Qn =-0.026 barn for neutron with j = 3/2). The
collective LLIV shift is

The nucleus 21

21

10Ne : < δH >= (C(2)

0,p + 1.1C(2)

0,n) · 15 MeV

(13)

The Schmidt model value for neutrons is < δH >=
−C(2)
0,n·4 MeV. Our understanding is that the authors of
the experimental paper [38] actually used 6 times smaller
value < δH >= −C(2)
0,n· 0.7 MeV, since they used <
p2/2m >= 5 MeV and K = 0.01 (instead of the realistic
values < p2/2m >= 30 MeV and K = 0.06), with the ref-
erence to a very crude estimate K ∼ 0.01 presented in [5].
Comparing their theoretical value < δH >= −C(2)
0,n·0.7
MeV with our result Eq.(13) we may conclude that the
experimental limits on the the tensor LLIV constants ob-
tained in Ref. [38] should be more than 20 times stronger
and include the linear combination C(2)
0,n in-
stead of C(2)
0,n. Dividing the limits from Table I in Ref.
[38] by 20 we obtain the following limits:

0 = C(2)

0,p + C(2)

CX = CY Z + CZY = (2.4 ± 2.2) · 10−30,
CY = CXZ + CZX = −(1.4 ± 1.7) · 10−30,
CZ = CXY + CY X = −(0.6 ± 0.7) · 10−30,
C− = CXX − CY Y = (0.7 ± 0.9) · 10−30.

The most important fact here is that Cij = Cij,p + Cij,n,
i.e.
they contain proton LLIV constants. This means
that the limits on the proton constants are improved by
5 orders of magnitude in comparison with the previous
best limits obtained using the Cs fountain in Ref.[42].

Note that the proton contribution in Eqs.(11,13) is di-
rectly expressed via the experimental value of electric
quadrupole moment and looks more reliable than the
neutron contribution. The collective model for the light
nucleus 21
10Ne with 11 neutrons only (including 3 neutrons
in external s-d shell) can not be very accurate. The ac-
curacy of the collective model for the neutron contribu-
tion is also low for all nuclei considered below since the
collective enhancement factor there is not as large as in
signiﬁcantly deformed nuclei. However, all limits on the
nuclear LLIV constants are meaningful on the logarith-
mic scale only.

The nucleus 201

80 Hg (valence neutron with j=3/2, LLIV
experiment [39]) has a relatively large Q=0.40 barn cor-
responding to the proton < δH >= C(2)

In 133

55 Cs (valence proton with j = 7/2, LLIV experi-

of Q is 40 times smaller: Q=-0.00358(4) barn correspond-
ing to < δH >= −C(2)
0,p· 0.15 MeV. Thus, a conservative
estimate of the LLIV shift is < δH >= −(C(2)
0,n)·
0.15 MeV. Corresponding limits on the proton (and neu-
tron) LLIV constants extracted from the experiment [42]
are 7 times weaker (at the level 10−24) than the limits
presented in the Table III of Ref. [42].
