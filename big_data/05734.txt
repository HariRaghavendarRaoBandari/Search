ABSTRACT

With the laws of mass conservation, momentum conservation and energy

conservation, incorporating the processes of neutral gas ionization and ion diﬀusion,

we develop a self-consistent model for the bright ribbon — the most prominent

feature in Io’s plasma torus. The model parameters are well constrained by earlier in

situ observations with the Galileo and Voyager spacescrafts. Our model calculation

indicates that the total power dissipated inside the torus is 3.6 times bigger than

the total power transported to Jovian ionosphere via Birkeland current. The power

dissipation inside the torus is relatively uniform. Most of the power transportation

associated with the Birkeland current, however, is localized near the ﬂux tube

of Io. With a height-intergrated conductivity of 0.15 mho in Jovian ionosphere,

consistent with earlier aeronomy models, the model gives a reasonable ﬁt to the recent

observations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter. Extra mass loading near Io is required

in the model. This excess of mass injection into the plasma torus may explain the

Io-correlated energy source revealed by earlier EUV observations with the Voyager

spacecrafts. Further investigation of the model implications is warranted.

Introduction

The coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere in solar planets reveals many important

physical processes, which may have signiﬁcant implications on distant astrophysical systems

[Mauk, Anderson and Thorne, 2002]. Since ﬁrst detected in 1964 [Bigg 1964], the Io correlated

Jovian decametric bursts have been well studied [Goldreich and Lynden-Bell 1969; Riihimaa 1968;

Imai, Wang and Carr 1997]. The implied interaction between Jupiter and Io has been attracting

attention in the community for more than two decades [Dessler 1983; Belcher 1987].

Pioneer 11 ﬁrst detected a plasma concentration near Io [Fillius, McIlwain and Mogro-

Campero 1975], which was later revealed by Voyager 1 as a plasma torus [Broadfoot et al. 1979].

The powerful EUV emission from this Io’s plasma torus (∼ 3 × 1012 W) has posed a theoretical

challenge since it was conﬁrmed by Voyager 2 [Sandel et al. 1979]. Several models have been

developed to account for this, among which are the unipolar inductor model [Goldreich and

Lynden-Bell 1969, Belcher 1987], the Alfv´en wing theory [Drell, Foley and Ruderman 1965;

Neubauer 1980] and the model with an extended neutral cloud distributed in the torus [Brown and

Ip 1981; Trauger 1984], with the last one being favored both theoretically [Barbosa, Coroniti and

Eviatar 1983; Barbosa 1994; Shemansky 1980] and observationally [Smyth and Shemansky 1983;

Skinner and Durrance 1986]. Although all the models achieve in explaining certain observations, a

global picture of the Jupiter-Io coupling system, which uniﬁes these models, does not exist.

Signiﬁcant progresses were made in recently years with the detection of Io’s footprint on

Jovian ionosphere both at IR with the NASA IRTF [Connerney et al. 1993; Satoh and Connerney

1999] and at UV with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) [Clarke et al. 1996]. This is especially

the case for the newly reported downstream emission of the Io’s footprint [Clarke et al. 2002] since

it indicates strong coupling between Jupiter’s ionosphere and Io’s plasma torus over an extend

region [Hill and Vasyli´unas 2002; G´erard et al. 2002]. Now observations exist on both ends of this

coupling system. Combining the recent HST observations on the Io’s footprint with the Galileo

spacecraft’s in situ measurements [Frank et al. 1996; Kivelson et al. 1996; Gurnett et al. 1996],

we develop a self-consistent model for one of the key features in the Io’s plasma torus—the bright

– 4 –

ribbon [Trauger 1984; Dessler and Sandel 1993; Schneider and Trauger 1995; Volwerk et al. 1997].

Our basic model assumption is that, led by Io, the extended neutral cloud is concentrated

within a narrow region of a few Io’s radii. Then a self-consistent hydrodynamical model is

developed for such a cloud with ionization and plasma diﬀusion processes parameterized. The

ionization of this neutral gas will not only energize the plasma around it, which eventually lead

to the formation of the bright ribbon feature detected in the torus, but also induce signiﬁcant

Birkeland currents which close in the northern and southern Jovian ionospheres, producing the

Io’s footprint and its downstream emission. Thus correlation is expected between emissions from

the ribbon and that from its footprint. In the paper, we mainly study the energy ﬂows in the

system. Our model calculation indicates that the energy transportation to Jovian ionosphere via

Birkeland current, which is localized near Io’s ﬂux tube, is comparable to the energy dissipation in

the plasma torus, which is relatively uniform along the ribbon. Future coordinated observations

will be able to test the model.

In § 2, we brieﬂy discuss the basic ideas for introducing such a model and develop full

dynamical equations for the ribbon. The observational constraints on the model parameters are

discussed in § 3. We then show that there is a very simple analytical solution to the dynamical

equations.

In § 4, we calculate the model predicted energy ﬂows and compare them with

observations. Our conclusions are drawn in § 5.

2. Model Description and Basic Equations

There is much observational evidence for the existence of an extended neutral cloud in the Io’s

plasma torus [see e.g. Smyth and Shemansky 1983; Skinner and Durrance 1986]. Theoretically,

Shemansky [1980] ﬁrst pointed out that the mass loading around Io is so insuﬃcient that the

heating of the plasma induced by it cannot balance the cooling due to EUV emission from the

plasma torus. This conclusion was later conﬁrmed by the Galileo in situ measurement [Bagenal

1997]. Russell and Huddleston [2000] recently showed that a small mass loading rate near Io

– 5 –

is also consistent with observations of the Jupiter-Io system made over the past three decades.

This small mass loading rate near Io then suggests an extended mass loading region, which may

associated with the extended neutral cloud observed.

A narrow ribbon in the Io’s plasma torus was ﬁrst reported by Trauger [1984] with Earth-based

optical observations. Dessler and Sandel [1993] later showed that the strong EUV emission from

the torus detected by the Voyagers is conﬁned within a region less than 9 RI in width, where

RI = 1.8 × 106 m is the radius of Io, consistent with Galileo observations which reveal dramatic

changes in the plasma’s property while Galileo ﬂying through the narrow wake of Io (∼ 6 RI )

[Frank et al. 1996; Kivelson et al. 1996; Gurnett et al. 1996]. The recent high-quality images of

[S II] 6731 ˚A emissions from S+, on the other hand, show this plasma feature in unprecedented

detail [Schneider and Trauger 1995].

Because we are mostly interested in its time-averaged properties, the ribbon can then be

approximated as in a steady state. We will assume that the narrow ribbon is surrounded by a

background plasma and the plasma and neutral gas distributions inside the ribbon only depend

on their azimuthal coordinate. By neglecting the variations of the gas and plasma properties in

the radial and vertical directions inside the ribbon, we reduce the study to an one dimensional

problem. As the ﬁrst step of such a investigation, these approximations are good enough to

address the relevant energy transportation processes. However the detailed gas and plasma

distributions will control the corresponding diﬀusion and ionization processes, which are crucial

for a self-consistent hydrodynamical model. In the following discussion, we will parameterize these

processes in accord with these approximations.

We will develop the model in Io’s rest frame. Then the mass conservation law is given by:

dρ
dt

=

∂ρ
∂t

+ ∇(ρv) ,

(1)

where ρ is the mass density of the ions inside the ribbon and v = veφ is the plasma’s velocity.

The neutral gas is roughly in a Keplerian orbit. Thus its velocity in Io’s rest frame is zero. Then

– 6 –

we have

(ρv)′ =

ρn
τn

−

ρ − ρb

τi

,

(2)

where ρn is the neutral gas mass density, which is zero outside the ribbon, ρb is the background

ion density, τn is the mean lifetime of the neutral gas, which characterizes the ionization processes

and τi is the diﬀusion time scale of the ions. A prime here denotes derivative with respective to

the azimuthal coordinate. In obtaining equation (2), we have assumed that the background ions

only have the eﬀect of suppressing the diﬀusive loss of ions from the ribbon.

From the momentum conservation equation

we have

dρv
dt

=

∂ρv
∂t

+ ∇(ρvv) ,

jB −

ρ − ρb

τi

v = v(ρv)′ + ρvv′ ,

(3)

(4)

where j is the current density and B is the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst term on the

LHS of equation (4) comes from the current acceleration by the magnetic ﬁeld. The second term is

associated with the diﬀusive loss of ions from the ribbon. Combining this equation with equation

(2), we get

jB =

ρn
τn

v + ρvv′ ,

(5)

which says that the current acceleration provides the momentum to speed up the ion newly

produced via neutral gas ionization, which corresponds to the ﬁrst term on the RHS, and the

momentum to accelerate the plasma ﬂow as indicated by the second term on the RHS.

The energy conservation law is given by

dρǫ
dt

=

∂ρǫ
∂t

+ ∇(ρvǫ) ,

(6)

where ǫ = v2/2 + ǫth is the plasma energy density per unit mass and ǫth is the plasma’s thermal

energy density per unit mass. From this, we have

jE − Λ −

ρ − ρb

τi

(cid:16)v2/2 + ǫth(cid:17) = (ρv)′(v2/2 + ǫth) + ρv2v′ + ρvǫ′

th ,

(7)

where E = vB is the electric ﬁeld, Λ is the cooling rate due to line emission. Multiplying equation

– 7 –

(5) with v, we have

Combining this equation with equation (7), one then gets

jE =

ρn
τn

v2 + ρv2v′ .

Λ =

ρn

τn (cid:16)v2/2 − ǫth(cid:17) − ρvǫ′

th .

(8)

(9)

This equation shows the energy balance between the cooling due to line emission and the

heating introduced by the injection of new plasma produced through neutral cloud ionization,

corresponding to the ﬁrst term on the RHS, and energy advection which corresponds to the second

term on the RHS.

To calculate the power carried by Birkeland current, which includes the power dissipated in

the Jovian ionosphere and that consumed in the electron accelerating double layers [Mauk et al.

2002], we note that the e.m.f. per unit length produced by the plasma inside the ribbon equals

Bv0, where v0 = 57 km s−1 is the rigid corotation velocity at Io’s orbit. Multiplying equation (5)

with (v0 − v), we have

jEJ =

ρn
τn

v(v0 − v) + ρvv′(v0 − v) ,

(10)

where EJ = B(v0 − v) is the electric ﬁeld in Jupiter’s co-rotation frame. Then the LHS gives the

power of the Birkeland current. The ﬁrst term on the RHS comes from the pickup current and the

second term is associated with the acceleration current.

Equation (5) can be written as

J =

ηn
τn

v + ηvv′ ,

(11)

where J = R dz j is the height-integrated current density, ηn = R dz(ρn/B) and η =R dz(ρ/B) are

the neutral gas content and plasma content per unit magnetic ﬂux inside the ribbon respectively.

This current closes in the Jovian ionosphere. Then the current continuity equation can be written

as [Hill 2002]

J = 2JθL−3/2 ,

(12)

– 8 –

where

Jθ = ΣEθ

(13)

is the height-integrated Peterson current, Σ is the height-integrated conductivity of Jovian

ionosphere [Strobel et al. 1983], Eθ is the strength of the electric ﬁeld in Jovian ionosphere and

L = 1/ sin2 θ. If we neglect the potential drop across the double layers in the Birkeland circuit, we

have

Eθ = −EJ (dL/dθ) = 2EJ L3/2 .

(14)

Then from equations (11), (12), (13), (14) and (2), we have the basic equations for the ribbon:

4ΣB(v0 − v) =

ηn
τn

v + ηvv′ ,

ηn
τn

−

η − ηb

τi

= (ηv)′ ,

(15)

(16)

where ηb = R dz(ρb/B) is the plasma content per unit magnetic ﬂux of the background within

which the ribbon embedded. Then if we neglect the neutral gas injection and plasma diﬀusion,

i.e. let ηn/τn = (η − ηb)/τi = 0, we have the results reported by Hill [2002]. Note in Hill’s paper,

he assumed that η is a constant, which is actually a very crude treatment of the plasma diﬀusion

processes and the mass conservation law. Our equations are accurate with the corresponding

physical processes parameterized. On the other hand, if we neglect the acceleration current, we

have the results given by Hill and Pontius [1998] and by Pontius and Hill [1982].

3. Model Parameters and an Analytical Solution

In equations (15) and (16), ηn/τn depends on the mechanism through which the neutral gas

is picked up from Io and gets ionized, and ηb depends on how the plasma diﬀuses away from the

torus. Because both processes are not well understood, we will leave ηn/τn, ηb as input functions.

B is measured by Kivelson et al.

[1996] with the magnetometer on Galileo: B ∼ 1400 nT. Σ

is given by aeronomy models [e.g., Strobel and Atreya, 1983]. We will adopt a ﬁducial value

of 0.1 mho. For given ηn and ηb, τi can be ﬁxed by the steady state condition (we will address

this in detail in the following discussion) when we solve the equations for v and η. Then with

– 9 –

the thermal properties of the plasma determined with models of the corresponding microscopic

processes [Barbosa, Coroniti and Eviatar 1983], we can calculate the model predicated emissions

from the ribbon, which can be compared with observations directly. At the same time, the power

of the Birkeland current can be associated with observations on the Io’s footprints on Jovian

ionosphere [Clarke et al 2002]. Strong correlation between emissions from the torus and that from

Io’s footprints is expected.

To solve the equations numerically, it is convenient to put the equations in a dimensionless

form. We deﬁne

v(φ) = f (φ)v0 ,

τn

= λ0Λ(φ) ,

η = λ0τ0g(φ) ,

ηb = λ0τ0gb(φ) ,

where ˙M is the total mass injection rate throughtout the ribbon, L = 5.9 is orbital radius of the

torus [Broadfoot et al. 1979], RJ = 7.1 × 107 m is Jupiter’s radius, w is the width of the ribbon.

We will assume that the ribbon has a width of 6 RI . Observations [[Trauger 1984; Dessler and

Sandel 1993; Schneider and Trauger 1995] indicate that the height of the narrow bright feature in

Io’s plasma torus is ∼ RJ , which is much larger than the width of the ribbon. This is because the

diﬀusion of ions is not isotropic in the plasma torus due to the existence of the strong magnetic

ﬁeld, which is roughly perpendicular to the plasma’s orbital plane. Such an anisotropy will make

the plasma spread out in the direction parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld line. And the deviation of

the magnetic ﬁeld line from the vertical direction also enhances this eﬀect when we have new ions

– 10 –

produced via neutral gas ionization as is the case in our model. Because the observed feature is

associated with the ion distribution directly, we would expect that the emission region be more

extended in the vertical direction than in the radial direction. However, the diﬀusion of neutral

gas is almost isotropic. So we can assume that the cross section of the ribbon is a square.

There are several independent estimates of the mass injection rate into the torus. The UVS

observation shows the total power of the UV emission from the torus is no less than 2.5 × 1012

W [Sandel et al., 1979], implying a mass loading rate ˙M > 1.6 × 103 kg sec−1 [Siscoe and Chen,

1977]. Dessler [1980] show that

˙M > 103 kg sec−1 based on the energy supply to the Jovian

magnetosphere from Jupiter’s rotation. The plasma production via ionization of the neutral gas

from Io in the magnetosphere will induce a slip of the plasma relative to corotation as the plasma

ﬂows outwards and angular momentum is transported from Jupiter out to the plasma ﬂow [Hill

1979]. Voyager 1 plasma observations [Bridge et al. 1979] indicate:

˙M ∼ 1.7 × 103(Σ/0.1mho) kg

sec−1 [Hill, 1980]. So 2.0 × 103 kg sec−1 is a reasonable ﬁducial mass injection rate.

Then we have

λ0 = 5.0 × 10−8

– 11 –

The ﬁrst constraint sets the normalization condition for Λ. To get the second constraint, we have

assumed that the ﬂux of the plasma inside the ribbon satisﬁes the periodic boundary condition.

However, other physical properties of the plasma don’t need to be continuous across Io because

shocks will be produced there. For given neutral cloud distribution in the torus, Λ(φ), satisfying

condition (26), background ion distribution gb and boundary conditions f (0) and g(0), it is obvious

that not all the solutions of equations (24) and (25) satisfy condition (27). Only certain value of α

(eign value) can make condition (27) satisﬁed. For arbitrary input functions Λ(φ) and gb, we must

choose an α to get a solution, then we check on condition (27) and adjust α until it is satisﬁed.

The calculation is quite complicated.

Fortunately, in the case that Λ − α(g − gb) = 0 everywhere and gb is a constant, which we call

local equilibrium in a smooth background, we have the following solution:

f =

σ − c1α

σ − αgb (cid:16)1 − c2e−(σ−αgb)φ/c1(cid:17) ,

g = c1/f ,

Λ = α(g − gb) ,

(28)

(29)

(30)

where c1 = gf , c2 = 1 − (σ − αgb)f (0)/(σ − αc1) can be ﬁxed with the boundary conditions

f (0) and g(0). Galileo observation shows that the averaged mass ﬂux in Io’s wake is about

< ρv >∼ 1.4 × 10−11 kg sec−1 m−2, where we have used a background speed of 5.3 × 104 m sec−1

[Bagenal 1997]. We also assumed a mean ion mass of 24 amu [Hill 2002]. From this we have

Galileo observations also reveal a sharp increase of electron number density and decrease in

the ﬂow velocity in Io’s wake. And the background mass ﬂux is < ρv >b∼ 8.0 × 10−12 kg sec−1

ﬂow inside the ribbon. Then the initial mean mass density of the plasma is 4.8 × 10−16 km m−3,

corresponding to an ion number density of 12000 cm−3. Then we have

(35)

(36)

These powers can be compared with observations with appropriate models which can predict the

observed emission from the Jupiter-Io system. Fitting observations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter

[G´erard et al. 2002], we ﬁnd

Σ = 0.15mho ,

σ = 17 .

Then solving equations (33) and (34), one has

α = 0.41 ,

c2 = 0.44 .

(39)

So we have the structure of the ribbon:

f = 0.95 − 0.42e−3.0φ ,

g = 5.2/(0.95 − 0.42e−3.0φ) ,

Λ = 2.1/(0.95 − 0.42e−3.0φ) − 1.3 ,

PB = 160 (0.05 + 0.42e−3.0φ) (0.87 + 7.1e−3.0φ)

In ﬁgure 1 we give the normalized power distributions in the azimuthal direction. The model gives

a reasonable ﬁt to observations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter. Figure 2 shows the integrated power

distributions. The integrations start at Io. From this we see that most of the power associated

with the Birkeland current is localized around Io. However, the power dissipation in the torus is

quite uniform. The model then fails to explain the Io phase eﬀect which says that about 20% of

the EUV power from the Io’s plasma torus is correlated with Io [Sandel & Broadfoot 1982b]. This

is not a surprise given our crude treatment of the boundary conditions near Io. Galileo in situ

observations show that the power supplied to the torus near Io accounts for 15% to 28% of the

total EUV power from the torus [Bagenal 1997], suggesting that Io phase eﬀect is associated with

the processes near Io. Investigation of these processes is beyond the scope of this paper. A global

self-consistent picture of the Jupiter-Io system should incorporate these processes with the model

we developed here for the ribbon.

We also note that the total power dissipated in the torus is 2.7 × 1012 W, which is consistent

with the EUV observations of emission from the torus. The power associated with the Birkeland

current is 1.1 × 1012 W which, when combined with the observed FUV power from Io’s footprint,

implies a FUV radiation eﬃciency of ∼ 10%. This total power supply to Jovian ionosphere

via Birkeland current sets a very strict constraint on the excitation mechanism of the FUV Io

tail. When combining with an auroral atmosphere model, one can infer an model predicted H +

– 14 –

brightness at Io’s footprint, which can be compared with the corresponding observations. The

total power supplied to the torus via ionization of the neutral cloud in the ribbon is given by

which is smaller than the sum of the power dissipated in the torus and that associated with the

Birkeland current. The power excess comes from the mass loading near Io, which breaks the

periodic conditions for the ribbon. So there is a net energy ﬂux from the ends of the ribbon, where

Io locates.

In ﬁgure 3, we show the current distribution J in the azimuthal direction, where

J = 1.2 × 106(0.87 + 7.1e−3.0φ) Am rad−1 ,

(47)

and the integrated current. The current near Io is ∼ 4 × 106 Ampere, which is consistent

with Voyager 1 in situ observations [Belcher 1987]. The total current across the ribbon is

9.6 × 106 Ampere. Because the newly produced ion via ionization of the neutral cloud gains

momentum through the current, we can estimate the total current across ribbon from the mass

injection rate in the torus:

I =

˙M vb
wB

= 7.0 × 106Am 

˙M

2 × 103kg s−1!(cid:18)

vb

5.3 × 104m s−1(cid:19)(cid:18) 1400nT

B (cid:19)  1.1 × 107m

! .

(48)

w

The fact that this current is smaller than the value from our numerical calculation also suggests

local excess of mass injection near Io, which requires extra current to accelerate the ions in the

ribbon to the velocity of the background plasma.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we develop a self-consistent model for the bright ribbon in Io’s plasma torus.

Most of the model parameters were determined theoretically or via observations. Thus the model

is well constrained. To compare with observations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter, we gave the

simplest analytical solution of the equations, which control the structure of the ribbon. The model

predicts a neutral cloud ionization rate as:

– 15 –

ρn
τn

= 6.4 × 10−27 kg cm−3s−1(cid:18)

2.1

0.95 − 0.42e−3.0φ

− 1.3(cid:19) ,

(49)

which can be combined with a model detailing the ionization processes of the neutral cloud to

make predictions on observations in the optical band [Smyth and Shemansky 1983].

The model also requires an ion distribution of

ni =

6400

0.95 − 0.42e−3.0φ cm−3 ,

(50)

inside the ribbon. This number density is higher than the canonical value of 2000 cm−3 by more

than a factor of 3. Although this high number density implies a relatively larger cooling rate, the

density is not high enough to explain the short cooling time reported by Volwerk et al.

[1997].

However, we noticed that the lack of correlation between the brightnesses of the two ansae can also

be explained as due to some plasma processes, such as plasma waves et al. These processes can

dump a local enhancement of energy density with the corresponding time scales. For example, the

Alfv´en velocity inside the ribbon is more than two times bigger than the co-rotation velocity at Io.

The corresponding time scale is more than two times smaller than the corresponding dynamical

time scale which is enough to explain the observed the lack of correlation. Further investigation

of its implication on the EUV emission processes is warranted [Barbosa, Coroniti, and Eviatar

1983a].
