Abstract

Let M be a closed smooth manifold and let f : M → M be a diﬀeomor-
phism. C 1-generically, a continuum-wise expansive satisﬁes Axiom A without
cycles. Let M = T3 and let f : T3 → T3. There are a C 1 neighborhood U (f )
of f ∈ RT (T3) and a residual set R ⊂ U (f ) such that for any g ∈ R, g is not
continuum-wise expansive, where RT (T3) is the set of all robustly transitive
diﬀeomorphisms on T3.

Introduction

Let M be a closed smooth manifold with dimM ≥ 2, and let Diﬀ(M) be the space of
diﬀeomorphisms of M endowed with the C 1 topology. Denote by d the distance on M
induced from a Riemannian metric k · k on the tangent bundle T M. In diﬀerentiable
dynamical systems, expansiveness is a very useful notion to investigate for stability
theory. For instance, Ma˜n´e [16] proved that the C 1-interior of the set of expansive
diﬀeomorphisms coincides with the set of quasi-Anosov diﬀeomorphisms. Here f is
quasi-Anosov if for all v ∈ T M \ {0}, the set {kDf n(v)k : n ∈ Z} is unbounded.
Let f ∈ Diﬀ(M). We say that f is expansive if there is e > 0 such that for any
x, y ∈ M if d(f i(x), f i(y)) < e for all i ∈ Z then x = y. Denote by E the set
of all expansive diﬀeomorphisms. From now, we introduce various expansiveness
(N-expansive, countably expansive, measure expansive [18, 19]) which are general
notions of original expansiveness.

We say that f is N-expansive if there is e > 0 such that for any x ∈ M, the
number of elements of the set Γe(x) = {y ∈ M : d(f i(x), f i(y)) < e for all i ∈ Z} is
less than N. Denote by GE the set of all N-expansive diﬀeomorphisms on M. We say
that f is countably expansive if there is e > 0 such that for x ∈ M, the number of
elements of the set Γe(x) = {y ∈ M : d(f i(x), f i(y)) < e for all i ∈ Z} is countable,
where e is an expansive constant for f.

Note that if a diﬀeomorphism f is expansive then Γe(x) = {x} for x ∈ M. Thus
if a diﬀeomorphism f is expansive then f is countably expansive, but the converse
is not true (see [19]).

For a Borel probability measure µ on M, we say that f is µ-expansive if there
is δ > 0 such that µ(Γe(x)) = 0 for all x ∈ M. In this case, we say that µ is a
expansive measure for f . We say that f is measure expansive if it is µ-expansive
for every non-atomic Borel probability measure µ. Denote by ME the set of all
measure-expansive diﬀeomorphisms on M.

Continuum-wise expansive diﬀeomorphisms was introduced by Kato [12]. A set
Λ is nondegenerate if the set Λ is not reduced to one point. We say that Λ ⊂ M is
a subcontinuum if it is a compact connected nondegenerate subset of M.

Deﬁnition 1.1 A diﬀeomorphism f on M is said to be continuum-wise expansive if
there is a constant e > 0 such that for any nondegenerate subcontinuum Λ there is an
integer n = n(Λ) such that diamf n(Λ) ≥ e, where diamΛ = sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Λ}
for any subset Λ ⊂ M. Such a constant e is called a continuum-wise expansive
constant for f .

Note that every expansive diﬀeomorphism is continuum-wise expansive diﬀeomor-
phism, but its converse is not true (see [12, Example 3.5]). Denote by CWE the set
of all continuum-wise expansive diﬀeomorphisms of M. In [4], Artigue showed that

E ⇒ GE ⇒ CE = ME ⇒ CWE,

where CE is the set of all countably expansive diﬀeomorphisms on M. For a C 1
perturbation expansive diﬀeomorphism, we can ﬁnd the following result (see [5, 13,
21, 22]). Denote by intA the C 1-interior of a set A of C 1-diﬀeomorphisms of M.

Theorem 1.2 Let f ∈ Diﬀ(M). Then we have the following

intE = intGE = intME = intCWE .

Let Λ be a closed f -invariant set. We say that Λ is hyperbolic if the tangent
bundle TΛM has a Df -invariant splitting Es ⊕ Eu and there exists constants C > 0
and 0 < λ < 1 such that

kDxf n|Es

xk ≤ Cλn and kDxf −n|Eu

x k ≤ Cλn

2

for all x ∈ Λ and n ≥ 0. If Λ = M then f is said to be Anosov.

It is well know that if a diﬀeomorphism f is Anosov then it is quasi-Anosov, but
the converse is not true (see [10]). Thus if a diﬀeomorphism f is Anosov then f is ex-
pansive, N-expansive, measure expansive, countably expansive and continuum-wise
expansive. We say that f satisﬁes Axiom A if the non-wandering set Ω(f ) is hyper-
bolic and it is the closure of P (f ). A point x ∈ M is said to be non-wandering for f
if for any non-empty open set U of x there is n ≥ 0 such that f n(U) ∩ U 6= ∅. Denote
by Ω(f ) the set of all non-wandering points of f. It is clear that P (f ) ⊂ Ω(f ). A dif-
feomorphism f is Ω-stable if there is a C 1-neighborhood U(f ) of f such that for any
g ∈ U(f ) there is a homeomorphism h : Ω(f ) → Ω(g) such that h ◦ f = g ◦ h, where
Ω(g) is the non-wandering set of g. A subset G ⊂ Diﬀ(M) is called residual if it
contains a countable intersection of open and dense subsets of Diﬀ(M). A dynamic
property is called C 1generic if it holds in a residual subset of Diﬀ(M). Arbieto [3]
proved that if a C 1 generic diﬀeomorphism f is expansive then it is Axiom A without
cycles. Lee [13] proved that if a C 1 generic diﬀeomorphism f is N-expansive then it
is Axiom A without cycles. Very recently, Lee [15] proved that if a C 1 generic dif-
feomorphism f is measure expansive then it is Axiom A without cycles. From that,
we consider C 1 generic continuum-wise expansive diﬀeomorphisms. The following
is a main result.

Theorem A For C 1 generic f ∈ Diﬀ(M), if f is continuum-wise expansive then it
is Axiom A without cycles.

We say that a f -invariant closed set Λ admits a dominated splitting if the tangent
bundle TΛM has a continuous Df -invariant splitting E ⊕F and there exist constants
C > 0 and 0 < λ < 1 such that

kDxf n|E(x)k · kDxf −n|F (f n(x))k ≤ Cλn

for all x ∈ Λ and n ≥ 0. If the dominated splitting can be written as a sum

TΛM = E1 ⊕ E2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ei ⊕ Ei+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ek,

then we say that the sum is dominated if for all i the sum

(E1 ⊕ E2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ei) ⊕ (Ei+1 ⊕ Ei+2 ⊕ · · · Ek)

is dominated. Note that the decomposition is called the ﬁnest dominated splitting
if we can’t decompose in a non-trivial way subbundle Ei appearing in the splitting.
The set Λ is partially hyperbolic if there is a dominated splitting E ⊕ F of TΛM

such that either E is contracting or F is expanding.

3

Deﬁnition 1.3 We say that a compact f -invariant set Λ ⊂ M is strongly partially
hyperbolic if the tangent bundle TΛM has a dominated splitting Es⊕Ec⊕Eu and there
exist C > 0 and 0 < λ < 1 such that for all v ∈ Es, we have kDf n(v)k ≤ Cλnkvk
for all n ≥ 0, and for all v ∈ Eu, we have kDf −n(v)k ≤ Cλnkvk for all n ≥ 0,
where Ec is the central direction of the splitting.

Note that if Λ is hyperbolic for f then it is strongly partially hyperbolic and Ec
is not empty, that is, Ec = {0}. For a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism, Burns
and Wilkinson [6] showed the following lemma.

Lemma 1.4 Let Λ be a compact f -invariant set with a partially hyperbolic splitting,

is foliated by foliations cW u(x), cW s(x), cW cs,i(x) and cW cu,i(x)(i = 1, . . . , k) such that

We say that a diﬀeomorphism f has a homoclinic tangency if there is a hyperbolic
periodic point p whose invariant manifolds W s(p) and W u(p) have a non-transverse
intersection. The set of C 1 diﬀeomorphisms that have some homoclinic tangencies
will be denoted HT . For a homoclinic tangency, Paciﬁco and Vieitez [20] proved that
surface diﬀeomorphisms presenting homoclinic tangencies can be C 1-approximated
by non-measure expansive diﬀeomorphisms. Form the result, Lee [14] proved that if
f has a homoclinic tangency associated to a hyperbolic periodic point p, then there
is a g C 1-close to f such that g is not continuum-wise expansive.

4

Proposition 1.5 [7, Theorem 1.1] The diﬀeomorphism f in a dense Gδ subset G ⊂
Diﬀ(M) \ HT has the following properties.

(a) Any aperiodic class C is partially hyperbolic with a one-dimensional central
bundle. Morevoer, the Lyapunov exponent along Ec of any invariant measure
supported on C is zero.

(b) Any homoclinic class Hf (p) has a partially hyperbolic structure

THf (p)M = Es ⊕ Ec

1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ec

k ⊕ Eu.

Moreover, the minimal stable dimension of the periodic orbits of Hf (p) is
dimEs or dimEs + 1. Similarly, the maximal stable dimension of the periodic
orbits of Hf (p) is dimEs + k or dimEs + k − 1. For every i = 1, . . . , k, there
exist periodic points in Hf (p) whose Lyapunov exponent along Ec
i is arbitrarily
close to 0. In particular, if f ∈ G, then f is partially hyperbolic.

Recently, Paciﬁco and Vieitez [20] proved that there is a residual subset G of
Diﬀ(M) \ HT such that for any Borel probability measure µ absolutely continu-
ous with respect to Lebesgue, f is µ-expansive. Lee [15] showed that there is a
partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism such that it is not measure expansive. From
the facts, we consider continuum-wise expansive for partially hyperbolic diﬀeomor-
phisms. The set λ is transitive if there is a point x ∈ Λ such that ω(x) = Λ, where
ω(x) the omega limit set of f. we say that the set Λ is robustly transitive if there
are a C 1-neighborhood U(f ) of f and a neighborhood U of Λ such that for any
g ∈ U(f ), Λg(U) = Tn∈Z gn(U) is transitive, where Λg(U) is the continuation of Λ.
Let M = T3 and let f : T3 → T3 be a diﬀeomorphism.

Theorem B There is a C 1 neighborhood U(f ) of f ∈ RT (T3) and a residual set
R ⊂ U(f ) such that for any g ∈ R, g is not continuum-wise expansive, where
RT (T3) is the set of all robustly transitive diﬀeomorphisms on T3.

2 Proof of Theorems

2.1 Proof of Theorem A

Let M be as before, and let f ∈ Diﬀ(M). The following Franks’ lemma [9] will play
essential roles in our proofs.

Lemma 2.1 Let U(f ) be any given C 1 neighborhood of f . Then there exist ǫ > 0
and a C 1 neighborhood U0(f ) ⊂ U(f ) of f such that for given g ∈ U0(f ), a ﬁnite

5

set {x1, x2, · · · , xN }, a neighborhood U of {x1, x2, · · · , xN } and linear maps Li
:
TxiM → Tg(xi)M satisfying kLi − Dxigk ≤ ǫ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N, there exists bg ∈ U(f )
such that bg(x) = g(x) if x ∈ {x1, x2, · · · , xN } ∪ (M \ U) and Dxibg = Li for all
1 ≤ i ≤ N.

The following was proved by [15]. For convenience, we give the proof in the

section.

Lemma 2.2 If f ∈ Diﬀ(M) has a non-hyperbolic periodic point, then for any neigh-
borhood U(f ) of f and any η > 0, there are g ∈ U(f ) and a curve γ with the following
property:

1. γ is g periodic, that is, there is n ∈ Z such that gn(γ) = γ;

2. the length of gi(γ) is less than η, for all i ∈ Z;

3. γ is normally hyperbolic with respect to g.

Proof. Let U(f ) be a C 1 neighborhood of f . Suppose p is not hyperbolic periodic
point of f. For simplicity, we may assume that p is a ﬁxed point of f . By Lemma
2.1, there is g ∈ U(f ) such that Dpgπ(p) has an eigenvalue λ with |λ| = 1. Then
g(p) = pg and TpgM = Es
pg is the eigenspace corresponding
to the eigenvalues with modulus less than 1, Eu
pg is the eigenspace corresponding to
the eigenvalues with modulus more than 1, and Ec
pg is the eigenspace corresponding
to λ. If λ ∈ R then dimEc

pg, where Es

pg ⊕ Eu

pg = 1 and if λ ∈ C then dimEc
pg = 1. For case dimEc

p = 2.
pg = 2, we can obtain the

In the proof, we consider dimEc

pg ⊕ Ec

result as in the case dimEc

pg = 1.

Since dimEc

pg = 1 we assume that λ = 1. By Lemma 2.1, there are ǫ > 0 and

h ∈ U(f ) such that

· h(pg) = g(pg) = pg,

· h(x) = exppg ◦ Dpgg ◦ exp−1

pg (x) if x ∈ Bǫ(pg), and

· h(x) = g(x) if x /∈ B4ǫ(pg).

Since λ = 1, we can construct a closed small arc Ipg ⊂ Bǫ(pg) ∩ exppg(Ec
its center at pg such that

pg(ǫ)) with

· diamIpg = ǫ/4,

· h(Ipg) = Ipg, and

· h|Ipg is the identity map.

pg(ǫ) is the ǫ-ball in Ec

pg centered at the origin −→o p. Then Ipg is normally

hyperbolic with respect to h, and for any η < ǫ/4, the length of Ipg is less than η.
(cid:3)

By the persistency of normally hyperbolic, we know that there is a neighborhood
U(g) of g such that for any ˜g ∈ U(g) there is a curve ˜γ close to γ such that all
properties of γ listed in the Lemma 2.2 is also satisﬁed for ˜γ.

For f ∈ Diﬀ(M), we say that f is the star diﬀeomorphism (or f satisﬁes the
star condition) if there is a C 1-neighborhood U(f ) of f such that all periodic points
of g ∈ U(f ) are hyperbolic. Denote by F (M) the set of all star diﬀeomorphisms.
Aoki [2] and Hayashi [11] showed that for any dimension case, if f ∈ F (M) then f
is Axiom A without cycles.

Lemma 2.3 [15, Lemma 3.4] There is a residual set G ⊂ Diﬀ(M) such that for any
f ∈ G,

· either f is a star,

· or for any ε > 0 there is a periodic curve γ such that the length of f n(γ) is

less than ε, for any n ∈ Z.

Proof. Let Hn be the set of C 1 diﬀeomorphisms f such that f has a normally
hyperbolic γ which is 1/n-simply periodic curve. Since γ is normally hyperbolic, we
know that Hn is open. Let Nn = Diﬀ(M) \ Hn. Then Hn(η) ∪ Nn(η) is open and
dense in Diﬀ(M). Let G = Tn∈N+(Hn ∪ Nn). Then G is C 1 residual in Diﬀ(M). Let
f ∈ G and assume f is not a star diﬀeomorphism, we know that f ∈ Hn for any
n ∈ N+ by Lemma 2.2. Hence f /∈ Nn and f ∈ Hn for any n. We know that f has
a normally hyperbolic γ which is ε-simply periodic curve, for any ε > 0.
(cid:3)

The following was proved by [5, Lemma 2.2].

Lemma 2.4 Let C ⊂ M be a continuum. f is continuum-wise expansive if and
only if there is δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ M, if a continuum C ⊂ Γδ(x) then C is
a singleton.

Proof of Theorem A. Let f ∈ G be continuum-wise expansive. Suppose by
contradiction that f 6∈ F (M). From Lemma 2.3, for any ε > 0 there is a pe-
riodic curve γ such that the length of f i(γ) is less than ε, for any i ∈ Z. Let
Γǫ(x) = {x ∈ M : d(f i(x), f i(y)) ≤ ǫ for all i ∈ Z}. Since f n(γ) = γ for some n ∈ Z,
we know γ ⊂ Γǫ(x). By Lemma 2.4, γ should be a singleton which is a contradiction
since γ is a nontrivial continuum. Thus if f ∈ G is continuum-wise expansive then
it is Axiom A without cycles.
(cid:3)

2.2 Proof of Theorem B

In this section, let M = T3 and let f : T3 → T3 be a diﬀeomorphism.
In [17,
Theorem B], Ma˜n´e constructed a robustly nonhyperbolic transitive diﬀeomorphism
f ∈ Diﬀ(T3). By [8, Theorem B], every robustly transitive diﬀeomorphism f on T3
is partially hyperbolic. Thus we can ﬁnd a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f
on T3 such that f is robustly nonhyperbolic transitive.

Remark 2.5 There is a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism f on T3 such that f is
robustly nonhyperbolic transitive.

Lemma 2.6 [8, Corollary D] and [1, Theorem 4.10] There is a residual set G1 ⊂
RT (T3) such that for any f ∈ G1, f is strongly partially hyperbolic, and T3 is the
homoclinic class Hf (p), for some hyperbolic periodic point p.

Let M be a closed smooth n(≥ 2)-dimensional manifold, and let f : M → M be a
diﬀeomorphism. The following notion was introduced by Yang and Gan [24]. For
any ǫ > 0, a C 1 curve η is called a ǫ-simply periodic curve of f if

(i) η is diﬀeomorphic to [0, 1] and its two endpoints are hyperbolic periodic points

of f,

(ii) η is periodic with period π(η) and L(f i(η)) < ǫ for any i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , π(η)},

where L(η) denotes the length of η, and

(iii) η is normally hyperbolic.

Lemma 2.7 [24, Lemma 2.1] There is a residual set G2 ⊂ Diﬀ(M) such that for
any f ∈ G2, and any hyperbolic periodic point p of f, we have the following:

for any ǫ > 0, if for any C 1 neighborhood U(f ) of f some g ∈ U(f ) has a ǫ-
simply periodic curve η such that two endpoints of η are homoclinically related with
pg then f has an 2ǫ-simply periodic curve ζ such that the two endpoints of ζ are
homoclinically related to p.

Proof of Theorem B. Let U(f ) be a C 1 neighborhood of f ∈ RT (T3) and let f ∈
G = G1∩G2. Let p be a hyperbolic periodic point of f . Then for any g ∈ G ∩U(f ), we
have T3 = Hg(pg), where pg is the continuation of p. Since Hg(pg) is not hyperbolic,
from [23, section 4], for any ǫ > 0, there is g1 ∈ G ∩ U(f ) such that g1 has an
ǫ-simply periodic curve η, whose endpoints are homoclinically related to pg1. Note
that η is a closed and connected set, so it is a nontrivial continuum. Let e = 2ǫ be

8

an expansive constant of g1. For x ∈ T3, we set Γe(x) = {y ∈ T3 : d(gi
for all i ∈ Z}. Since gπ(pg)

(η) = η, we have

1

1(x), gi

1(y)) ≤ e

L(giπ(pg)

1

(η)) = L(η) < e.

Clearly η ⊂ Γe(x). Since η is compact and connected, and so, η is not singleton
(cid:3)

which is a contradiction.
