(Dated: March 16, 2016)

We investigate possible entropy production in Yang-Mills (YM) ﬁeld theory by using a quantum distribution
function called Husimi function fH(A, E, t) for YM ﬁeld, which is given by a coarse graining of Wigner
function and non-negative. We calculate the Husimi-Wehrl (HW) entropy SHW(t) = −TrfH log fH deﬁned as
an integral over the phase-space, for which two adaptations of the test-particle method are used combined with
Monte-Carlo method. We utilize the semiclassical approximation to obtain the time evolution of the distribution
functions of the YM ﬁeld, which is known to show a chaotic behavior in the classical limit. We also make
a simpliﬁcation of the multi-dimensional phase-space integrals by making a product ansatz for the Husimi
function, which is found to give a 10-20 per cent over estimate of the HW entropy for a quantum system with a
few degrees of freedom. We show that the quantum YM theory does exhibit the entropy production, and that the
entropy production rate agrees with the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents or the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy,
suggesting that the chaoticity of the classical YM ﬁeld causes the entropy production in the quantum YM theory.

Introduction.— Thermalization or entropy production in an
isolated quantum system is a long-standing problem. The en-
tropy of a quantum system may be given by von Neumann
entropy SvN = −Tr ρ log ρ with ρ being the density ma-
trix [1], and taking into account that the time evolution of
the quantum system is described by a unitary transformation
U (t) = e−iHt/, von Neumann entropy SvN is shown to re-
main unchanged in time, which is an absurd consequence in
contradiction to the reality. One possible way to avoid this
puzzle is to assume that there is no isolated quantum system
because any quantum system is surrounded by the environ-
ment composed of quantum ﬁelds described by, say, QED;
the partial trace with respect to the environment would lead to
a density matrix of a mixed state due to the entanglement[2].
For thermalization of a macroscopic quantum system, the old
idea of von Neumann has been recently rediscovered, and then
a lot of related works and developments are being made [3, 4];
see [5] and references cited therein. It might be worth men-
tioning that the entanglement entropy of a quantum system
may have a geometrical interpretation as is clearly shown by
Ryu-Takayanagi’s formula [6].

In this work, we do not intend to develop a master theory
to describe thermalization or entropy production of a generic
quantum system.
Instead, we concentrate on entropy pro-
duction in quantum systems whose classical counter parts are
chaotic, and the semiclassical approximation is valid. There
are many physical systems satisfying these characteristics
[39]: Among them, we have in mind the problem of the early
thermaliztion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions (see review
[7] and recent studies [8–25]) at the relativistic heavy-ion col-
lider in the Brookhaven National Laboratory [26–29] and the
large hadron collider at CERN [30].

Chaotic classical systems are characterized by the sensi-
tive dependence of the trajectory on the initial condition, and
trajectories starting from adjacent initial conditions with the
difference δX(0) in the phase space deviate exponentially
|δX(t)| = exp(λt)|δX(0)| from each other: The exponent λ
is called a Lyapunov exponent. Then one can readily imagine
that the chaotic behavior makes the phase-space distribution
f (q, p) so complicated to generate a ﬁnite amount of entropy
via a coarse graining in the classical Hamiltonian system. In
this respect, it is interesting that the sum of positive Lyapunov
exponents coincides with the Kolomogorov-Sinai entropy (see
references in Ref. [31]) or the production rate of entropy [32].
Indeed, these have been demonstrated for a discrete classical
system [33], where an explicit calculation of the Boltzmann-
like entropy SB = −Trf log f was made with the distribution
function f (q, p) as obtained by a coarse graining of the phase
space of the discrete system.

A natural extension of the above interesting work to a quan-
tum system might be done with the application of the quan-
tum mechanical distribution function, i.e., Wigner function
fW (q, p) derived as a Weyl transform of the density matrix
ρ [34]. However, since fW is a mere Weyl transform of ρ, it
can not describe an entropy production of a pure quantum sys-
tem, even apart from the fact that fW is not positive deﬁnite.
To circumvent this well known difﬁculty, let us recall that
one can not distinguish two phase space points in a unit cell
in quantum mechanics, and smearing in the phase space vol-
ume of (2π)D may be allowed, where D is the degrees of
freedom (DOF) of the system. As such a smeared distribution
function, we adopt Husimi function fH [35], which is obtained
by a Gaussian smearing of Wigner function and semi-positive
deﬁnite. Then, we can deﬁne the Boltzmann-like entropy in
terms of fH as SHW = −Tr fH log fH, where Tr means the
integral over the phase space. This entropy was ﬁrst intro-
duced and called the classical entropy by Wehrl [36], and
we call it Husimi-Wehrl (HW) entropy [37, 38]. In the pre-
vious work [38], the present authors examine thermalization

of isolated quantum systems by using the HW entropy evalu-
ated in the semiclassical approximation. It was shown that the
semiclassical treatment works well in describing the entropy-
production process of a couple of quantum mechanical sys-
tems whose classical counter systems are known to be chaotic.
Two novel methods were also proposed to evaluate the time
evolution of the HW entropy, the test-particle method and the
two-step Monte-Carlo method, and it was demonstrated that
the simultaneous application of the two methods ensures the
reliability of the results of the HW entropy at a given time.

In this article, we extend the previous work [38] to the
Yang-Mills (YM) ﬁeld, which is known to be chaotic and has
macroscopic number of positive Lyapunov exponents [17].
We investigate the possible entropy production by construct-
ing the Husimi function and calculating the HW entropy of
the YM ﬁeld in the semiclassical approximation. The initial
condition we adopt for the equation of motion (EOM) of the
YM ﬁeld is motivated by the early stage of relativistic heavy
ion collisions [39, 40].

There is, however, a caveat against this simple prescription
that works for quantum mechanical systems with a few de-
grees of freedom because of the large number of the degrees
of freedom peculiar to the ﬁeld theory. Thus we also take
a simple ansatz for the Husimi function, where we construct
it by a product of Husimi function for each degree of free-
dom, although the classical EOM itself is solved numerically
with the fully included nonlinear couplings. When applied to
a quantum mechanical system with two-degrees of freedom,
the ansatz gives 10 to 20 per-cent over estimate of the HW
entropy. We also develop a novel efﬁcient numerical method
for calculating the HW entropy, which is a modiﬁcation of
the test-particle method. We show that the YM theory does
exhibit the entropy production, and ﬁnd that the entropy pro-
duction rate agrees with the sum of positive Lyapunov expo-
nents or KS entropy. As long as we know, this is the ﬁrst work
to calculate the time dependence of entropy in non-integrable
ﬁeld theory except for the kinetic entropy shown in Ref. [41].

In the semi-classical approximation, we ignore O(2) terms,

As in quantum mechanics, Husimi function is semi-positive
deﬁnite;fH[A, E; t] ≥ 0, and we deﬁne the Husimi-Wehrl
entropy as the Boltzmann’s entropy or the Wehrl’s classical

Numerical methods.— We calculate the time evolution of
the HW entropy by two methods; test particle (TP) method
and parallel test particle (pTP) method. The TP method is de-
veloped in Ref. [38]. The pTP method, an alternative method
for two-step Monte Carlo method, requires less numerical
cost and gives almost the same results as two-step Monte
Carlo method. We have demonstrated that the HW entropy in
some quantum mechanical systems are successfully obtained
in these two methods, which are reviewed in the following.

In the test-particle method (TP), we assume that the Wigner

function is a sum of the delta functions,

The Husimi-Wehrl entropy of the YM ﬁeld is obtained as
a natural extension of that in quantum mechanics by regard-
ing (A(x), E(x)) as canonical variables. First, we deﬁne the
Wigner function (referred to as the Wigner functional [42]) in
terms of A(x) and E(x),

fW [A, E; t] =Z DA′

where NTP is the total number of the test particles. The
initial conditions of the test particles are (Ai(0), Ei(0))
(i = 1, 2, . . . , NTP), which are chosen so as to well sam-
ple fW [A, E, 0].
The time evolution of the coordinates
(Ai(t), Ei(t)) is determined so that it reproduces the EOM
for fW [A, E, t], which is reduced to the canonical equation of
motion Eq. (4) in the semiclassical approximation.

With the test-particle representation of the Wigner function,

Eq. (7), the Husimi function is readily expressed as

Eq. (7).

the integral over (A, E)i for each i has
a support only around the positions of the test particles
(Ai(t), Ei(t)) due to the Gaussian function, and we can ef-

deviations of p/2∆ and p∆/2, Monte-Carlo sampling
point (A, E)i for each i is generated as (A, E)i = (Ai, Ei) +

In the parallel test particle method, we make test particles in
and out of logarithm independent, while they are same sam-
ples in TP. Figure 1 shows the numerical results of the HW

This system is called a modiﬁed quantum Yang-Mills
(mqYM) model in Ref. [38]. With increasing test-particle
number, the HW entropy is found to converge from below
(above) in the TP (pTP) method, then it is possible to give up-
per and lower limits of the entropy and to guess the converged
value by comparing the results in the two methods.

Product ansatz and example in a 2-dim quantum mechan-
ical system.— While the extension to the ﬁeld theory on the
lattice is straightforward, the DOF are so large and numerical-
cost demanding in quantum ﬁeld theories that we need to in-
voke some approximation scheme in practical calculations.
We here adopt product ansatz to avoid this difﬁculty.

In the ansatz, we construct the Husimi function as a product

FIG. 1: Time evolution of Husimi-Wehrl entropy for the modiﬁed
quantum Yang-Mills mechanics in TP and pTP methods.

The entropy estimated with the product ansatz gives the up-
per bound of the entropy, since it holds subadditivity. The
subadditivity of entropy is expressed as

S1(ρ1) + S2(ρ2) ≥ S12(ρ12) ,

(13)

where ρ1 = R dΓ2ρ12 and ρ2 = R dΓ1ρ12 and S1 and S2 are

subsystem entropies. In this paper, we apply it to the Husimi
function and the Husimi-Wehrl entropy. Thus obtained en-
tropy S(PA)

ditivity;

with the product ansatz in TP and pTP methods where the numbers of

both methods without the product ansatz NTP = 15000.

63lattice and 83lattice, respectively. The black and gray solid lines
show growth rates of LLE and ILE, respectively, given in Ref. [17].

conﬁrm entropy production. The HW entropy with product
ansatz is found to agree with that without the ansatz within
10-20% error in a few dimensional quantum mechanical sys-
tem. We also ﬁnd that numerical results with the ansatz con-
verge with smaller Monte Carlo samples, then it is much more
efﬁcient from the view point of numerical-cost reduction.

Entropy production in Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory.— We ap-
ply the above-mentioned framework to the SU(2) Yang-Mills
ﬁeld theory. The initial condition of the Winger function
is set to be a Gaussian distribution, fW [A, E; t = 0] =
2ND exp(−ωA2/ − E2/ω), which corresponds to a coher-
ent state. The Wigner-function evolution is obtained by solv-
ing the classical EOM, and the HW entropy with the product
ansatz is calculated by using the TP and pTP methods. We
take the parameter set,  = ω = ∆ = 1.

In Fig. 3, we show the time evolution of the Husimi-Wehrl
entropy per DOF with the product ansatz in TP and pTP meth-
ods. We ﬁnd that the HW entropy per DOF is independent of
the lattice size, and the extensive nature of entropy is con-
ﬁrmed. The dependence on the number of test-particle num-
ber is the same as that in quantum mechanics; With increas-
ing Monte Carlo samples, S(PA)
HW converges from below and
above in the TP and pTP methods, respectively. The results in
the TP and pTP methods approach each other with increasing
NTP and we can guess that the converged value lies between
these curves. After the oscillation around lattice time= 0.5,
the HW entropy increases in a monotonic way and its growth
rate decreases. This means that the collective motion in the
earliest stage damps, and the system approaches the equilib-
rium. The entropy saturation occurs at t ∼ 3 in the lattice unit
in the present setup.

The straight lines in Fig. 3 show the Kolmogorov-Sinai en-
tropy rate, which is given in Ref. [17]. The upper and lower

lines show the sum of positive local and intermediate Lya-
punov exponents (LLE and ILE), respectively. LLE are ob-
tained as the eigen values of the second derivative matrix of
the Hamiltonian, and ILE show the exponential growth rate
in some time duration. Since the classical YM ﬁelds are con-
formal, the KS entropy rate should be proportional to ε1/4
where ε is the energy per site. The coefﬁcients are evaluated
in Ref. [17] as RLLE
KS /L3 ≃ 2 × ε1/4
for the sum of positive LLE and ILE (local and intermediate
KS entropy rate), respectively. These ﬁndings show that the
local KS entropy rate characterizes the growth rate of the HW
entropy in the early time and the intermediate KS entropy rate
agrees with the average entropy growth until the thermaliza-
tion time.

KS /L3 ≃ 3 × ε1/4 and RILE

Conclusion.— In summary, we have developed the numer-
ical formulation to calculate the time evolution of the Husimi-
Wehrl (HW) entropy in Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory in the semi-
classical approximation. This is a ﬁrst work to calculate the
time evolution of entropy in a non-integrable ﬁeld theory ex-
cept for the kinetic entropy shown in Ref. [41] as long as we
know. We have shown that the HW entropy is produced and
the growth rates roughly agree with Lyapunov exponents. It
should be noted that the time reversal invariance is kept in
the present framework; in the time evolution of the Wigner
function as well as in measuring the entropy. The produced
entropy mainly comes from the complexity of the phase space
distribution.

The entropy growth will have contribution to the thermal-
ization process in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The set
up in this article is motivated by the initial stage dynamics
in relativistic heavy ion collisions. If we interpret the lattice
spacing a as the inverse saturation scale Q−1
s = 0.2 fm/c at
RHIC, the lattice time scale is also normalized by the sat-
uration scale Q−1
s . This means that the observed entropy-

saturation time (t ∼ 3 in the lattice unit) is about 0.6fm/c,
which might be the encouraging result for the early thremal-
ization scenario which is suggested by the hydrodynamical
simulation (review Ref. [7]). For more realistic analysis, we
should choose the initial condition such as the one given by
the McLerran-Venugopalan model [39].
