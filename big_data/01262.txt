Testing the variation of fundamental constants by

astrophysical methods: overview and prospects

S.A. Levshakov1,2

E-mail: lev@astro.ioﬀe.rssi.ru

By measuring the fundamental constants in astrophysical objects one can test basic physical
principles as space-time invariance of physical laws along with probing the applicability limits of the
standard model of particle physics. The latest constraints on the ﬁne structure constant α and the
electron-to-proton mass ratio µ obtained from observations at high redshifts and in the Milky Way disk
are reviewed. In optical range, the most accurate measurements have already reached the sensitivity
limit of available instruments, and further improvements will be possible only with next generation
of telescopes and receivers. New methods of the wavelength calibration should be realized to control
systematic errors at the sub-pixel level. In radio sector, the main tasks are the search for galactic and
extragalactic objects suitable for precise molecular spectroscopy as well as high resolution laboratory
measurements of molecular lines to provide accurate frequency standards. The expected progress in
the optical and radio astrophysical observations is quantiﬁed.

Introduction

The idea that the fundamental physical constants may vary on the cosmological time scale has been
discussing since 1937, when Milne and Dirac argued about possible variations of the Newton constant
G during the lifetime of the universe [1, 2]. Currently, the subject of the cosmological variation of
fundamental constants is closely related to emergence considerations of diﬀerent cosmological models
inspired by the discovery of late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe [3, 4]. The possibility
that dimensionless coupling constants such as electron-to-proton mass ratio µ = me/mp and the ﬁne
structure constant α = e2/c may roll with cosmic time has recently been reviewed in [5, 6, 7, 8].

The variation of fundamental constants would imply a violation of the Einstein equivalence principle
(EEP), that is, local position invariance (LPI) and local Lorentz invariance (LLI). In particular, a changing
α accompanied by variation in other coupling constants can be associated with a violation of LLI [9], and
LPI postulates that the fundamental physical laws are space-time invariant. The standard model of
particle physics (SM) is based on the EEP; thus, we can probe the applicability limits of the SM and new
types of interactions by experimental validation of the EEP.

In spite of some claims that changes in α or µ were marginally detected at high redshifts, to date
no conﬁrmed variation of dimensionless coupling constants has been found on astronomical space-time
scales. Below we review current observational constraints on α and µ variations which provide limits on
the allowed deviations from the SM and ΛCDM cosmology.

2 Basics of the astronomical measurements

Two dimensionless coupling constants µ and α are of particular interest for astronomical studies since
their fractional changes ∆µ/µ = (µobs − µlab)/µlab, and ∆α/α = (αobs − αlab)/αlab can be accurately
measured from spectral line proﬁles of Galactic and extragalactic sources.

Diﬀerential measurements of ∆µ/µ and ∆α/α are based on the comparison of the line centers in the
absorption/emission spectra of cosmic objects and the corresponding laboratory values. It was shown that

electro-vibro-rotational lines of H2 [10] and CO [11] have their own sensitivities to µ-variation. Similarly,
each atomic transition is characterized by its individual sensitivity to α-variation [12]. The dependence
of an atomic frequency ω on α in the comoving reference frame of a distant object located at redshift z is
given by: ωz = ω + qx + O(x2), where x ≡ (αz/α)2 − 1. Here ω and ωz are the frequencies corresponding
to the present-day value of α and that at a redshift z. The so-called q factor is an individual parameter
for each atomic transition [12]. If αz (cid:54)= α, then x (cid:54)= 0 and the corresponding frequency shift ∆ω = ωz − ω
is ∆ω/ω = Q∆α/α, where Q = 2q/ω is the dimensionless sensitivity coeﬃcient.
For two lines of the same element with the sensitivity coeﬃcients Q1 and Q2, the fractional changes
∆µ/µ and ∆α/α are equal to ∆v/(c∆Q), where ∆v = v1 − v2 is the diﬀerence of the measured radial
velocities of these lines, and ∆Q = Q2 − Q1 is the corresponding diﬀerence between their sensitivity
coeﬃcients [13, 14].
The Q values of atomic transitions observed in quasar spectra are very small, |Q| (cid:28) 1 [12]. Similar low
sensitivity coeﬃcients were calculated for electro-vibro-rotational transitions in H2 and CO (for references,
see [14]). Small values of Q and ∆Q put tough constraints on optical methods to probe ∆α/α and ∆µ/µ.
For instance, at ∆α/α ∼ 10−5, the required line position accuracy must be σv <∼ 0.25 km s−1 in accord
√
with the inequality [14]: σv/c < (∆Q/
2)(∆α/α). A typical error of the line center measurements of
an unsaturated absorption line in quasar spectra is about 1/10th of the pixel size [15]. For high redshift
objects, the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) provides
a pixel size ∆λpix ∼ 0.06 ˚A at λ ∼ 5000 ˚A, that is σv ∼ 0.5 km s−1, which is comparable to the
velocity oﬀset due to a fractional change in α at the level of 10−5. This shows that special care and
additional calibrations are required to probe ∆α/α and ∆µ/µ at a level of 10−6 by optical methods. Such
measurements have been carried out at the VLT/UVES as described in the next section.

3 VLT/UVES Large Program for testing fundamental physics

The ESO Large Programme 185.A-0745 (2010-2013) was especially aimed at testing the hypothetical
variability of physical constants [16, 17, 18, 19]. Its prime goal was to study systematic errors in wavelength
scales of quasar spectra. For this purpose quasars were observed almost simultaneously with bright
asteroids, whose reﬂected sunlight spectra contain many narrow features with positions as accurate as a
few m s−1 [20]. Additionally, bright stars were observed through an iodine gas absorption cell, providing
a precise transfer function for part of the wavelength range.

As a result, there were revealed distortions of the wavelength scale with a jig-saw pattern and peak-to-
peak amplitude of several hundreds m s−1 along the echelle orders. The presence of long range wavelength
dependent velocity drifts ranging between ∼0.5 and 1.0 km s−1 and showing opposite sign as compared
with the Keck/HIRES spectra of quasars were found as well [21].
A stringent bound for ∆α/α was obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.69 towards the quasar HE2217-
2818 [16]. The fractional change of α in this system is ∆α/α = (1.3± 2.4stat ± 1.0sys)× 10−6 if Alii λ1670
˚A and three Feii transitions are used, and ∆α/α = (1.1 ± 2.6stat) × 10−6 in a slightly diﬀerent analysis
with only Feii transitions used. Together with another system observed with the UVES/VLT at zabs =
1.58 towards HE0001-2340 where ∆α/α = (−1.5 ± 2.6stat) × 10−6 [22], and eight HIRES/Keck quasar
absorbers with the mean ∆α/α = (−0.1 ± 2.6) × 10−6 [23], these values are the tightest bounds to date
on α-variation at high redshifts. As seen, they do not show any evidence for changes in α at the precision
level of ∼ 3 × 10−6 (1σ conﬁdence level, C.L.).
For the electron-to-proton mass ratio the analysis of the H2 absorption lines of the zabs = 2.40 damped
Ly-α system towards HE0027-1836 yields ∆µ/µ =(2.5 ± 8.1stat ± 6.2sys) × 10−6 [17]. When corrections
to the wavelength dependent velocity drift are applied then ∆µ/µ = (7.6 ± 8.1stat ± 6.3sys) × 10−6. At
higher redshift zabs = 4.22 the analysis of H2 absorption lines in the spectrum of J1443+2724 gives ∆µ/µ
= (9.5± 5.4stat ± 5.3sys)× 10−6 [24]. These results are consistent with a null µ-variation at the ∼ 2× 10−5
(1σ C.L.) precision level over a lookback time of ≈ 12.4 Gyr (10% of the age of the Universe today).

Testing the variation of fundamental constants

4 Microwave and submillimeter molecular transitions

Radio astronomical observations allow us to probe variation of the fundamental constants on the
cosmological time scale at a level deeper than 10−5. In the microwave range there are a good deal of
molecular transitions arising in Galactic and extragalactic sources. Electronic, vibrational, and rotational
energies in molecular spectra are scaled as Eel : Evib : Erot = 1 : µ1/2 : µ. This means that the sensitivity
coeﬃcients for pure vibrational and rotational transitions are equal to Qvib = 0.5 and Qrot = 1. Molecules
have also ﬁne and hyperﬁne structures, Λ-doubling, hindered rotation, accidental degeneracy between
narrow close-lying levels of diﬀerent types and all of them have a speciﬁc dependence on the physical
constants. Some of these molecular transitions are ∼ 100 times more sensitive to variations of µ and
α than atomic and electro-vibro-rotational transitions of H2 and CO which are detected in six quasar
absorbers between z = 1.6 and 2.7 [25]. In addition, positions of narrow molecular lines arising from cold
dark clouds in the Milky Way disk can be measured with uncertainties of σv <∼ 0.01 km s−1 [26], that

is, the resulting sensitivity in radio bands is about three orders of magnitude higher as compared with
optical spectra.

The molecular transitions with enhanced sensitivity coeﬃcients which are the prime targets for testing
the constancy of the fundamental constants by radio astronomical methods were recently reviewed in [14].
For instance,
inversion transitions of ammonia NH3 — one of the most abundant molecules in the
interstellar medium — have sensitivity coeﬃcients Qµ = 4.5 [27]. This enhancement occurs due to
the tunneling eﬀect depending on the action S which is proportional to µ−1: the ground state tunneling
frequency ω ∝ e−S. Observations of the NH3(1,1) inversion line and ﬁve HC3N rotational lines at zabs =
0.89 towards PKS1830-211 [28], as well as the inversion (NH3) and rotational (CS, H2CO) lines at zabs
= 0.69 towards B0218+357 [29] led to constraints (1σ C.L.): |∆µ/µ| < 5 × 10−7 and |∆µ/µ| < 1 × 10−7,
respectively.

The second molecule which is extremely sensitive to µ-variation and which is observed in galactic and
extragalactic molecular clouds is methanol CH3OH. The sensitivity coeﬃcients Qµ for diﬀerent transitions
in CH3OH range from −53 to 42 [30, 31]. A distinctive feature of methanol is strong interaction between
the internal (hindered) and overall rotations. Transitions, in which both the internal and overall rotation
states are changed, have strongly enhanced Qµ-factors. However, the magnetic hyperﬁne structure of
methanol transitions which was partly resolved in laboratory measurements [32] put natural restriction
on the methanol method at the level of ∼ 10−8 in ∆µ/µ tests. The hyperﬁne coupling in methanol is
due to the well known magnetic spin-rotation and spin-spin couplings leading to small line splittings of
∼ 10 kHz. The large amplitude internal rotation may also lead to a less known magnetic coupling — the
so-called spin-torsion coupling — which has not yet been conclusively evidenced.

So far, methanol absorption lines were detected at zabs = 0.89 in the gravitationally lensed system
PKS1830-211 [33]. This system provides the most stringent limit on changes in µ over a lookback time
of ≈ 7.5 Gyr: |∆µ/µ| < 2 × 10−7 (1σ C.L.) [34].
Cold (Tkin ∼ 10 K) and dense (nH2 ∼ 104 cm−3) molecular cores in the Milky Way disk are another
perspective targets to probe µ. The molecular cores are the ammonia emitters exhibiting some of the
narrowest (∆v <∼ 0.2 km s−1 (FWHM)) lines ever observed [35, 36]. The NH3 linewidths ∆v of some
of them correspond to a pure thermal broadening at a minimum gas temperature of Tkin ≈ 8 K coming
mainly from the heating by cosmic rays [37]. A lifetime of molecular cores is ∼ 106−7 yr [38], and they
are located at regions with diﬀerent gravitational potentials.

A sample of molecular cores were studied with the Medicina 32-m, Nobeyama 45-m, and Eﬀelsberg
100-m telescopes in [26, 39, 40]. The main result of these measurements is the most stringent limit on
µ-variation for the period of ∼ 106−7 yr obtained by astronomical methods [26]: |∆µ/µ| < 7 × 10−9 (1σ
C.L.). This upper limit is comparable with the current constraint stemming from laboratory experiments,
˙µ/µ < 6 × 10−16 yr−1 [41].

An independent test that α and µ may diﬀer between the high- and low-density environments of
the Earth and the interstellar medium was performed with CH and OH in [42]. In the Milky Way, the

4

S.A. Levshakov

strongest limit to date on α-variation is |∆α/α| < 1.4 × 10−7 (1σ C.L.).
Thus, the Einstein heuristic principle of LPI is validated all over the universe, that is, neither α at the
level of ∼ few × 10−6, no µ at the level of ∼ few × 10−7 deviates from its terrestrial value for the passed
1010 yr. Locally, no statistically signiﬁcant deviations of ∆µ/µ from zero were found at even more deeper
level of ∼ few × 10−9. For the ﬁne structure constant, such limit is ∼ 10−7.

5 Future prospects

In previous sections we demonstrated that the radio observations of NH3 and CH3OH lines are an order
of magnitude more sensitive to fractional changes in µ than the optical constraints derived from H2.
However, at cosmological distances there are only ﬁve radio molecular absorbers known and all of them
are located at z < 1, whereas H2 lines are detected at redshifts 2 <∼ z <∼ 4.
As was emphasized in [14], the improvements in measurements of ∆α/α and ∆µ/µ at the level of,
respectively, 10−8 and 10−9, can be achieved if two main requirements will be fulﬁlled: (i) increasing
precision of the laboratory measurements of the rest frame frequencies of the most sensitive molecular
transitions, and (ii) increasing sensitivity and spectral resolution of astronomical observations.

The second requirement is expected to be realized in a couple of years when the Next Generation Very
Large Array (ngVLA) will start regular operations [43]. The ngVLA will provide ten times the eﬀective
collecting area of the JVLA and ALMA, operating from 1 GHz to 115 GHz, with ten times longer baselines
(300 km). The increased sensitivity of the ngVLT by an order of magnitude over the VLA would allow
discovery of new molecular absorbers at z > 1 and, thus, would extend the sample of targets suitable to
test the EEP at early cosmological epochs.

In optical sector, the forthcoming generation of new optical telescopes such as the Thirty Meter
Telescope (TMT) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) equipped by high-resolution
ultra-stable spectrographs will signiﬁcantly improve the constancy limits of fundamental couplings. The
future high precision optical measurements should achieve sensitivities of ∼ 10−7 for individual absorbers.
Thanks to a large sample of absorption-line systems, a few times deeper limit is expected for the ensemble
average.

In spite of a far higher sensitivity of radio methods as compared to that of next-generation optical
facilities, the unresolved (or partly resolved) magnetic hyperﬁne structure of molecular transitions prevents
the radio measurements to achieve the accuracy better than ∼ 10−9.

For example, the hyperﬁne structure of several transitions in methanol CH3OH was recently recorded
in the microwave domain using the Fourier transform microwave (FT-MW) spectrometer in Hannover and
the molecular beam FT-MW spectrometer in Lille [32]. With the line splitting of ∼ 10 kHz revealed in
these laboratory studies, and the diﬀerence between the sensitivity coeﬃcients ∆Qµ ∼ 10 for the 48.372,
48.377, and 60.531 GHz methanol lines observed at zabs = 0.89 towards PKS1830-211 [34], one ﬁnds the
uncertainty of ∆µ/µ of about 3 × 10−8, which is entirely caused by the unresolved hyperﬁne structure of
methanol lines.

It should be obvious that further progress in radio sector is in need of accurate laboratory
measurements of the rest frame molecular frequencies. The required uncertainty of laboratory frequencies

is <∼ 1 m s−1. There is currently a shortage of such data. Among molecules with high sensitivity
coeﬃcients to changes in µ and α only NH3 [44] and CH [42, 45] transitions fulﬁll this requirement.

6 Conclusions

In this short review we highlighted the most important observational results which mark the frontier of
most precise spectroscopic measurements of line positions in optical and radio sectors aimed at diﬀerent
tests of the variation of fundamental physical constants by astrophysical methods.

Testing the variation of fundamental constants

Current null results from the VLT and Keck optical telescopes as well as from diﬀerent radio telescopes
validate the Einstein equivalence principle at a rather deep level of ∼ 10−7−10−6 for extragalactic sources,
and at ∼ 10−8 within the Milky Way disk. This is a tremendous step forward in experimental justiﬁcation
of basic principles of the general relativity and the standard model of particle physics as compared with
the ﬁrst astrophysical constraint on |∆α/α| < 3 × 10−3 towards radio galaxy Cygnus A (z = 0.057)
obtained 60 years ago by Savedoﬀ [46].

It should to be emphasized that both optical and radio methods complement each other and in future
will provide independent tests of ∆α/α and ∆µ/µ variability using the next-generation radio and optical
telescopes.
