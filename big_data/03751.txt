Abstract

Ballistic electron transport is a key requirement for existence of a topological phase tran-

sition in proximitized InSb nanowires. However, measurements of quantized conductance as

direct evidence of ballistic transport have so far been obscured due to the increased chance

of backscattering in one dimensional nanowires. We show that by improving the nanowire-

metal interface as well as the dielectric environment we can consistently achieve conductance

quantization at zero magnetic ﬁeld. Additionally, studying the sub-band evolution in a rotat-

ing magnetic ﬁeld reveals an orbital degeneracy between the second and third sub-bands for

perpendicular ﬁelds above 1T.

Semiconducting nanowires made from InAs and InSb are prime candidates for the investiga-

tion of novel phenomena in electronic devices. The intrinsic strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI)

and large g-factor combined with ﬂexible fabrication has resulted in these materials being inves-

tigated for applications in quantum computing,1, 2, 3 spintronics4, 5, 6 and Cooper pair splitters.7, 8

More recently, these nanowires have been investigated as solid-state hosts for Majorana zero modes

(MZMs).9, 10, 11, 12 By bringing a one dimensional (1D) nanowire with strong SOI into close con-

tact with a superconductor under an external magnetic ﬁeld, a region with inverted band structure

emerges, creating MZMs at its ends. Together with strong SOI and induced superconductivity, a

key requirement for MZMs is quasi-ballistic electron transport along the length of the proximi-

tized region in the nanowire, with a controlled odd number of occupied modes.13 In the absence of

scattering, the motion of 1D conﬁned electrons will be restricted to discrete energy bands resulting

in quantized conductance plateaus.14, 15 Measurements of quantized conductance in the nanowires

therefore provide direct evidence for controlled mode occupation, as well as ballistic transport in

these nanowires.

Although now routine in gate deﬁned quantum point contacts (QPC) in two-dimensional elec-

tron gases (2DEG),14, 15, 16, 17, 18 quantized conductance in one dimensional semiconductor nanowires

is more difﬁcult to achieve. In a 1D nanowire, scattering events along the electrons path to and

through the constriction between the source and drain contacts have an increased probability of

2

reﬂection, obscuring the observation of quantized conductance.19 These scattering events may be

due to impurities and imperfections in the crystal lattice, or due to surface states that create inho-

mogeneities in the local electrostatic environment.20 A Schottky barrier between the nanowire and

metallic contacts will result in additional backscattering events, further smearing out the quantized

conductance plateaus. To date, quantized conductance in InSb nanowires has only been observed

at high magnetic ﬁelds (> 4T), where electron backscattering is strongly suppressed.19 No quan-

tization has been observed in InSb for magnetic ﬁelds below 1T, where the topological transition

is expected to take place.9

Here we demonstrate conductance quantization in InSb nanowires at zero magnetic ﬁeld. We

have developed a robust fabrication recipe for observing quantized conductance by optimizing

both the metal-nanowire contact interface and dielectric environment through the use of hexagonal

boron nitride (hBN) as a gate dielectric. We study the evolution of the quantized conductance

plateaus with both source-drain bias as well as magnetic ﬁeld, and extract values for the Landé

g-factor of the ﬁrst three sub-bands in the nanowire. Additionally, we observe an orbital energy

degeneracy of the second and third sub-bands at ﬁnite magnetic ﬁelds applied perpendicular to the

nanowire.

Figure 1a) shows a cross-sectional view of our devices. They consist of an intrinsic Si-substrate

with local metallic gates made of Ti/Au (5/10nm), on top of which a sheet of hexagonal boron ni-

tride (hBN) is mechanically transferred as the dielectric. The chemical stability, atomic ﬂatness,

and high breakdown voltage,21 together with the well established dry transfer mechanism22 makes

hBN an ideal dielectric for our nanowire devices. InSb nanowires grown by metal-organic vapor

phase epitaxy23, 24 (1 - 3µm long and 70 - 90nm diameter) are transferred deterministically with
a micro-manipulator25 onto the hBN dielectric. Electrical contacts to the nanowire (evaporated

Cr/Au (10/100nm), 150 - 400nm spacing) are deﬁned by electron beam lithography. Before con-

tact deposition, the surface oxide of the nanowires is removed using sulfur passivation26 followed

by a short in situ He-ion mill. Residual sulfur from the passivation step also induces surface doping,

which aids contact transparency. Further details of the fabrication are included in the supporting

1b). The samples are mounted in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 15mK and

measured using standard lock-in techniques at 73 Hz with an excitation VRMS = 70 µV. Voltage is

applied to the outer contact and current measured through the grounded central contact, while the

third, unused contact is left ﬂoating.

We ﬁrst characterize each device by sweeping the voltage on the underlying gate Vgate at ﬁxed

bias voltage Vbias = 10mV across the sample. Conductance is obtained directly from the measured

current G = I/Vbias and an appropriate series resistance is subtracted in each case (see supporting

information). Figure 1c) plots the conductance of the nanowire as function of gate voltage for

four different devices fabricated on the same chip. Devices with both ﬁne gates as well as wide

back gates have been measured. We ﬁnd that while ﬁne gates allow more ﬂexible gating, devices

with wide back gates showed more pronounced conductance plateaus even after extensive tuning

of the ﬁne gates. Data from additional devices all fabricated on the same chip is included in the

supporting information.

As seen in Fig 1c) all devices show well deﬁned plateaus at G0 and 3G0 but the plateaus at 2G0

and 4G0 appear smaller or even completely absent. Unlike QPC’s formed in 2DEGs, nanowires

possess rotational symmetry. This symmetry can give rise to additional orbital degeneracies in

the energies for the 2nd and 3rd as well as the 4th and 5th sub-band (Fig 1d).27, 28 In conductance

measurements at ﬁnite bias, sub-bands that are close in energy or degenerate will be populated
at similar values in gate voltage giving a double step of 4 e2
suppressed plateaus at 2 and 4G0 (Fig 1e).29

h , which explains the

h instead of 2 e2

To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we measure the differential conductance G =

dI/dVbias as function of gate voltage and bias voltage for one of these devices (corresponding to

the green trace in Fig 1c). This data is shown in Fig 2a) as a color plot, with a line cut along zero

bias voltage added in the bottom panel. At zero bias voltage an extended plateau is visible at 1G0,

together with an additional small plateau at 2G0 which was not visible in the linear conductance

data of Figure 1c). The existence of this small 2G0 plateau indicates that the device has a small,

5

but ﬁnite energy splitting between the second and third sub-band which was not resolved at high

bias. At ﬁnite bias voltage the conductance will only be quantized in integer values of G0 if both
µsource and µdrain occupy the same sub-band. This creates diamond shaped regions of constant
conductance indicated by black dotted lines in Fig 2a). At the tip of the diamond the two dotted

lines cross when Vbias is equal to the sub-band energy spacing ∆Esubband. From this we extract
∆Esubband and the lever-arm η of the bottom gate via η Vgate = ∆Esubband.30, A ﬁnite magnetic
ﬁeld breaks time reversal symmetry, lifting spin degeneracy and splitting the individual spin sub-

bands En,↑/↓ by the Zeeman energy EZeeman = gµBB. Here µB denotes the Bohr magneton and
g the Landé g-factor. Experimentally this splitting manifests as the appearance of additional half
2 · 2e2/h. At B = 4T we clearly observe this for the ﬁrst sub-band as shown in Fig
integer steps N
2b) where an additional plateau emerges at 0.5G0. Similarly, the second sub-band should also

split into two plateaus at 1.5 and 2G0. However only the 2G0 plateau is visible, suggesting that

the orbital degeneracy between E2,↑ and E3,↑ remains at ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld.

Plateaus appear as diamonds and are indicated by black dotted lines.

The full evolution in magnetic ﬁeld of the conductance and transconductance is shown in Fig

3a,b) and individual line traces of the conductance taken in steps of 1T are presented in Fig 3c).

While the plateau at 1G0 remains very ﬂat up to high magnetic ﬁelds, the second plateau at 2G0

increases in height for magnetic ﬁelds larger than 400mT. Around 1T two new plateaus emerge

These correspond to the lower energy spin sub-bands E1↑ and

E2,3↑. Here we can clearly see experimentally that the non-degenerate orbital state at zero ﬁeld

transforms into a degenerate orbital state at ﬁnite ﬁeld and that E2,3↑ remain degenerate over a

magnetic ﬁeld range of several Tesla.

From the individual gate traces we convert the plateau width to energy by using the lever arm η
extracted from Figure 2. This way we can directly extract the sub-band spacing E2↑ − E1↑ and the
individual g-factors g1, g2,3 through a linear ﬁt ﬁxed at the origin to E1↓ − E1↑ and E2,3↓ − E2,3↑.
We ﬁnd g1 = 39± 1 g2,3 = 40± 1 and a constant sub-band spacing E2↑ − E1↑ ≈ 16meV .

Orbital degeneracy of sub-bands has previously been observed in metallic point contacts29 and

recently also in passivated narrow InAs nanowires with highly symmetric conducting channels.27

However, the magnetoconductance of InSb nanowires may deviate signiﬁcantly from the results

found in InAs nanowires. In InAs, Fermi level pinning leads to conduction close to the nanowire

surface31, 32 which strongly inﬂuences the sub-band dispersion in magnetic ﬁeld.33, 34 InSb has

no surface accumulation35 and the electron wave-function will be more strongly conﬁned in the

center of the nanowire. For cylindrical nanowires individual sub-band wave functions are given

cal simulations of wires with a hexagonal cross-section show qualitatively similar results.28, 36 An

additional magnetic ﬁeld will add Zeeman splitting, but also causes orbital effects which can sub-

stantially change the sub-band dispersion depending on the orientation of the ﬁeld with respect to

the nanowires axis.37 Numerical simulations of nanowires in a magnetic ﬁeld show that orbital ef-

fects strongly depend on the magnetic ﬁeld orientation and can dominate the sub-band dispersion,
leading to a decrease of the energy splitting between E2 and E3.37 Furthermore these simulations
also show that the orbital effects can strongly inﬂuence the phase diagram of MZMs.37 Using the

model of ref. 37 with the parameters of our device (wire radius: 35nm; g-factor: 40) we simulate

this change in the sub-band dispersion for a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular (Fig 4c) and parallel (Fig

4d) to the nanowire. A perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld causes E2,↑ and E3,↑ to shift higher and closer

in energy, while a parallel magnetic ﬁeld increases the energy splitting of the higher sub-bands E2

and E3, due to their different orbital angular momentum.

Experimentally we test this by rotating the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig 5.

When aligning the magnetic ﬁeld along BZ (almost perpendicular to the nanowire, Fig 5a,b), a

small splitting appears at the beginning of the ﬁrst plateau for ﬁelds above BZ = 0.6T, marking

the onset of the 0.5-plateau. In contrast, in the second plateau the splitting only starts above 1T

and the line-cuts (Fig 5b) show that the new plateau emerges at 2G0. Similarly, for a magnetic

ﬁeld along BX (Fig 5c,d), a new plateau emerges around BX = 0.6T in the ﬁrst step but not in the

second. However, for the magnetic ﬁeld aligned along BY (mostly parallel to the nanowire) shown

in Fig 5e,f) we do see a clear difference. Now two new plateaus emerge almost simultaneously
around BY ≈ 0.75T, with the second plateau at 1.5 and not at 2G0, in agreement with the expected
behavior due to orbital effects.

In conclusion we achieved substantial improvements in electrical transport measurements of

InSb nanowires by using a high quality hBN dielectric and clearly demonstrated conductance quan-

tization at zero magnetic ﬁeld, as well as degenerate sub-bands at magnetic ﬁeld above 1T. In the

future these, improvements will allow the more detailed investigation of features in the 1st plateau,

10

such as signatures of a helical gap,38, 39 or the presence of a 0.7 anomaly.40, 41, 42 The large SOI

in our InSb nanowire strongly inﬂuences the electron dispersion relation and the tunability with

magnetic ﬁeld could add new insight into the underlying physics.43 We did not see any clear fea-

tures related to the 0.7-anomaly in our devices. However, the 0.7 state becomes more pronounced

at higher temperatures.40 A more detailed study of the temperature dependence of conductance

quantization may reveal more information about the existence of this intriguing state in nanowire

QPCs.
