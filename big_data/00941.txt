ABSTRACT

Magnetic reconnection is a rapid energy release process that is believed to be re-
sponsible for ﬂares on the Sun and stars. Nevertheless, such ﬂare-related reconnection
is mostly detected to occur in the corona, while there have been few studies concerning
the reconnection in the chromosphere or photosphere. Here we present both spectro-
scopic and imaging observations of magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere leading
to a microﬂare. During the ﬂare peak time, chromospheric line proﬁles show signiﬁcant
blueshifted/redshifted components on the two sides of the ﬂaring site, corresponding
to upﬂows and downﬂows with velocities of ±(70–80) km s−1, comparable with the
local Alfvén speed as expected by the reconnection in the chromosphere. The three-
dimensional nonlinear force-free ﬁeld conﬁguration further discloses twisted ﬁeld lines
(a ﬂux rope) at a low altitude, cospatial with the dark threads in He I 10830 Å images.
The instability of the ﬂux rope may initiate the ﬂare-related reconnection. These obser-
vations provide clear evidence of magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere and show
the similar mechanisms of a microﬂare to those of major ﬂares.

Introduction

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental physical process on the Sun, and is considered to be
the cause of many kinds of solar activities, from drastic eruptions like ﬂares and coronal mass ejec-
tions (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976; Shibata 1999), to

– 2 –

small-scale events like Ellerman bombs (Archontis & Hood 2009; Fang et al. 2006a) and microﬂares
(Tandberg-Hanssen & Emslie 1988). Although magnetic reconnection is supposed to be the most
important ingredient in theoretical models for various solar activities, in particular solar ﬂares, its
observational evidence is still elusive. Most major solar ﬂares are believed to originate in the ten-
uous and fully ionized corona, a favorable place for magnetic reconnection to proceed. There have
been some observations supporting the reconnection picture like double hard X-ray sources above
the ﬂare loop top (Sakao et al. 1992; Masuda et al. 1994; Bentley et al. 1994), cusp-like structure in
soft X-ray loops (Acton et al. 1992; Tsuneta et al. 1992; Doschek et al. 1995), reconnection inﬂows
(Yokoyama et al. 2001; Sun et al. 2015), and sudden changes in magnetic topology (Masuda et al.
1994; Sun et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2011). Recent observations reveal hot outﬂows with large veloc-
ities during ﬂares, which can be seen in both images and spectra (Wang et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2013;
Reeves et al. 2015). Note that, the outﬂows in ﬂare-related reconnection have been detected mostly
in one direction at a time. In particular, simultaneous bidirectional outﬂows have been reported in
transition region explosive events from an optically thin line, e.g., the Si IV 1393 Å line (Innes et al.
1997).

It is known that, theoretically, magnetic reconnection can also occur in the lower atmosphere
(Sturrock 1999). The most recent observations of Ellerman bombs and hot explosions show bidirec-
tional ﬂows as revealed in chromospheric and coronal lines. These ﬂows indicate magnetic recon-
nection in the photosphere or the temperature minimum region, which is locally heated to a high
temperature comparable with that of the upper chromosphere or transition region (Vissers et al.
2015; Peter et al. 2014). Nevertheless, we still lack enough observational evidence of magnetic re-
connection in the lower atmosphere leading to ﬂares.

In this Letter, we report observations of a reconnection scenario in the chromosphere that
produces a microﬂare by investigating the Hα and Ca II 8542 Å spectra. In Section 2, we present
the observations. Data analysis and results are shown in Section 3, which is followed by a summary
and discussions in Section 4.

2. Observations

A microﬂare of GOES B-class occurred in Active Region NOAA 12146 at 21:04 UT on 2014
August 24. This active region was very complex and had produced three C-class ﬂares during the
past three days. We observed this microﬂare with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS,
Chae et al. 2013a) and the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS, Cao et al. 2012)
installed at the 1.6 meter New Solar Telescope (NST, Cao et al. 2010; Goode & Cao 2012) of Big
Bear Solar Observatory. FISS adopts an Echelle disperser, and can acquire both Hα and Ca II 8542 Å
line spectra along a slit simultaneously with the aid of dual cameras. The scan over the target region
yields two-dimensional spectra and monochromatic images at diﬀerent wavelengths. The spectral
resolution is 0.19 mÅ and 0.26 mÅ for the two lines respectively, and the spatial sampling is 0′′.16.
NIRIS can provide He I 10830 Å images with a high spatial resolution. It covers a ﬁeld of view

– 3 –

(FOV) of about 85′′ × 85′′ with a pixel size of about 0′′.083. The time cadence is 35 s for FISS and
10 s for NIRIS.

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) on the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012) can provide extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images with a pixel size
of 0′′.6 and a cadence of 12 s, and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012)
provides both line-of-sight magnetograms and vector ﬁeld data in the photosphere with the same
pixel size but a cadence of 45 s and 12 min respectively.

Before data analysis, we need to co-align the images from diﬀerent instruments. Note that
for the NST data, a de-rotation of images should be performed ﬁrst. The basic method used for
co-alignment is to calculate the correlation coeﬃcients of two images with diﬀerent oﬀsets, and to
ﬁnd the optimal oﬀset value that corresponds to the maximum coeﬃcient. A sub-region of images
containing the most distinguishable feature like a sunspot is used for co-alignment. In practice, we
choose a base (reference) image and co-align all the other images with that. As the morphology of
the sunspot does not change much during our observations, this code can yield good results. For
co-alignment of data from NST and SDO , we use the AIA 1700 Å image as the reference one. The
accuracy of all the co-alignment is within 1′′.2.

Fig. 1(a) shows the lightcurves of the microﬂare in two channels of AIA, as well as the lightcurve
of Hα (wavelength-integrated intensity). It is seen that the microﬂare lasts for about ten minutes.
At the beginning of the ﬂare, a set of ﬂare loops appear in both the 304 Å and 94 Å channels.
In particular, one can notice two bright loops that are located closely in space (Fig. 1(b)-(c)).
The left (southeastern) loop reaches its peak emission about two minutes earlier than the right
(northwestern) one (Fig. 1(a)). After the ﬂare peak, the loops gradually cool down. Here, we focus
on the brightest part of the left loop, which produces the ﬁrst peak of EUV emission and is likely
the site of ﬂare energy release (magnetic reconnection).

On the other hand, the magnetic ﬁeld around the ﬂare region (Fig. 1(d)) is very complicated,
showing adjacent opposite polarities and parasitic polarities. It is known that such a complicated
magnetic structure is a favorable place for ﬂare occurrence.

The ﬂare seen in Hα and Ca II 8542 Å brightens nearly simultaneously and cospatially with
that in 304 Å and 94 Å during the ﬂare peak time (Fig. 1(e)-(f)). However, the Hα and Ca II 8542
Å emission is relatively restricted to particular sites where the chromosphere (formation layer of the
two lines) gets signiﬁcantly heated. It is interesting that in the He I 10830 Å images, there appears
a dark thread-like structure in addition to some brightenings seen below the threads (Fig. 1(g)).
The dark threads seem to have a twist and experience an untwisting with the ﬂare development.

3. Data Analysis and Results

3.1. Spectral Analysis of the Flare Region

In the ﬂaring region, the chromospheric Hα and Ca II 8542 Å lines show obvious asymmetries
(see Figs. 3 and 4). In particular, the Hα line proﬁle exhibits broadened wings that are higher than
the continuum level, and the Ca II 8542 Å line proﬁle shows a hump in either the red or the blue
wing. For these asymmetric line proﬁles showing a net emission, their contrast proﬁles, the proﬁles
on the ﬂare subtracted by the pre-ﬂare ones, can be used to study the change in proﬁles, which
is caused by the ﬂare (Canﬁeld & Metcalf 1987). Applying the radiative transfer equation with a
constant source function S for the ﬂare yields:

If = I0 exp(−τf ) + S[1 − exp(−τf )],

(1)

where If is the emergent intensity from the ﬂare, I0 is the background intensity from the pho-
tosphere, and τf is the optical depth of the ﬂare-perturbed atmosphere. At the far wings, the
chromosphere is normally transparent, so that the background intensity can roughly be replaced by
the pre-ﬂare intensity In, and τf is suﬃciently less than unity (Ichimoto & Kurokawa 1984). Then
the equation above can be simpliﬁed as

If − In ≈ (S − In)τf .

(2)

Therefore, such contrast proﬁles, in particular at the far wings, can be regarded as the net emission
from the ﬂaring plasma at a height where the magnetic energy is released, namely the reconnection
site.

We ﬁrst apply the bisector method to derive the mass ﬂow velocities from the Doppler shifts
of the Hα line. The bisector method, also referred to as lambdameter, is a simple but often used
method to derive Doppler velocities from optically thick line proﬁles (Chae et al. 2013b). This
method makes a horizontal cut at a certain emission intensity on the proﬁle C(λ) so that

C(cid:18)λm −

δλb

2 (cid:19) = C(cid:18)λm +

δλb

2 (cid:19) ,

(3)

where δλb is the full width of the line cut, and λm is considered as the observed line center. Then the
Doppler velocities are derived from the shifts of the line center relative to the theoretical (reference)
one. Since the bisector is usually not a straight line, diﬀerent values of velocities can be obtained
for horizontal cuts at diﬀerent intensity levels (Hong et al. 2014), i.e.
from line center to wings,
which are supposed to represent diﬀerent heights of the solar atmosphere. Choosing the level for
the horizontal cut should balance two requirements as below. On one hand, one needs to choose
as far as possible the line wings so that Equation (2) can still hold. On the other hand, the noise
becomes large at the far wings that can yield a large uncertainty in the derived velocities. For our
event, we choose the horizontal cut at line wings with a net emission intensity of 0.2 times the
maximum intensity to avoid the invalidity of the method towards the line center as well as the noise

– 5 –

at far wings (Ding et al. 1995). Such an intensity level corresponds to the chromospheric level where
microﬂares likely occur (Fang et al. 2006b). Note that our ﬁrst purpose is to provide a velocity map
through a preliminary analysis of the line proﬁles. Changing the level of the horizontal cut a little
can only change slightly the absolute value but not the direction of the derived velocity.

The velocity map at the ﬂare peak time (Fig. 1(e)) reveals clearly both the downﬂows and
upﬂows in the ﬂare region, which are located very close to the bright regions seen in Hα and Ca II
8542 Å, also the brightest part of the left ﬂare loop seen in 304 Å and 94 Å (Fig. 1(b)-(c)). Note
that we actually get a time series of velocity maps during the ﬂare, which show that such ﬂows
appear impulsively in the ﬂare rise phase and become relatively steady for about two minutes. We
select a region of interest (ROI) containing one brightest part with striking opposite velocity signs
nearby for further study (the yellow square in Fig. 1(e)). The size of the ROI is 4′′ × 5′′.

We divide the ROI into 10 × 20 grids and show the Hα contrast proﬁles at each grid point
in a time sequence (Fig. 2). Line asymmetries are clearly seen during the ﬂare peak time. For
example, in a number of subpanels (columns 6–8, row 8), blueshifted emission is seen in the top
region while redshifted emission appears in the bottom region. Though the redshifted emission
seems stronger than the blueshifted emission, the speed derived from them are similar. The red
and blue asymmetries appear nearly simultaneously and at locations only separated by about 3′′,
implying that they are physically related with each other.

For a more quantitative study, we focus on some typical Hα line spectra with signiﬁcant asym-
metries along both the scan and slit directions (Fig. 3(a)), and plot the contrast proﬁles at two
speciﬁc positions during the ﬂare peak time (Fig. 3(c) and (f)). It is interesting that these asym-
metric proﬁles consist of two components, a main (static) component and a second (redshifted or
blueshifted) one. Based on the shapes of the line proﬁles observed in our event, we use a multi-
component function, which comprises two Gaussian-shaped components plus a constant background,
to ﬁt the contrast proﬁle:

C(λ) = A0 + A1exp"−(cid:18) λ − λ1

σ1 (cid:19)2# + A2exp"−(cid:18) λ − λ2

σ2 (cid:19)2# ,

(4)

where A0 is the background, A1 and A2 are the strengths, and σ1 and σ2 are the widths of the two
components, respectively. In particular, λ1 and λ2 are the ﬁtted line centers of the two components.

The procedure ‘mpﬁtfun.pro’ in the Solar SoftWare package, which can ﬁt a user-supplied
model to data using the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm to solve the least-squares problem, is used
for the double Gaussian ﬁtting. The results show Doppler velocities of ±(70–80) km s−1 from the
second components. The related downﬂows and upﬂows should be located in the chromosphere
where the Hα line is formed (Leenaarts et al. 2012). Such a speed is comparable with the local
Alfvén speed in the chromosphere (Nishizuka et al. 2008). Note that the Ca II 8542 Å proﬁles
show similar asymmetries but with somewhat smaller velocities (±(40–50) km s−1) from the second
components (Fig. 4). These signiﬁcant bidirectional ﬂows in the ﬂare region are most likely the
outﬂows of magnetic reconnection.

3.2. The Cause of Line Asymmetries

Usually, it is diﬃcult to interpret the asymmetries of optically thick lines, in particular the Hα
line. For the blue asymmetry (larger blue wing emission), it can either be caused by an upward
motion of a heated plasma (in emission) or a downward motion of a relatively cool plasma (in
absorption). Likewise, the red asymmetry (larger red wing emission) can be produced by either a
downward moving plasma in emission or an upward moving plasma in absorption. Such a scenario
has been clearly veriﬁed by non-LTE calculations (Heinzel et al. 1994) and more recently by radiative
hydrodynamic simulations of the ﬂare atmosphere (Kuridze et al. 2015). However, we tend to verify
from multi-aspects that in our event, the blue and red asymmetries are related to upﬂows and
downﬂows of the heated plasma in emission, respectively. First, as can be seen from the asymmetric
proﬁles, there appears a big hump in the blue wing (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 4(c)) or in the red wing
(Fig. 3(f) and Fig. 4(f)). This is a strong signature of existence of a Doppler-shifted emission
component superposed on a static proﬁle at the blue or red wings, while it can hardly be produced
by an absorption at the opposite wings. Second, the time evolutions of the line wing intensities hint
an emission cause of the line asymmetries. For the red asymmetric proﬁles, the intensity of the red
wing rises more sharply than the blue wing when the ﬂare begins (Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 4(d)). This
is contrary to the line asymmetries of an absorption cause, in which one might expect a temporary
decrease of the intensities at the opposite wings if the increase due to ﬂare heating and the drop due
to absorption are not exactly coincident. Third, previous model calculations showed that the line
asymmetries may change their sign with the development of the ﬂare owing to the diﬀerent heating
status of the moving plasma (Heinzel et al. 1994; Kuridze et al. 2015). In our event, however, the
line asymmetries do not change their sign during the whole ﬂare. Fourth, the same asymmetries
appear not only in the Hα line but also in the Ca II 8542 Å line. The latter is formed somewhat lower
than the former. To our knowledge, there are no model calculations up to now showing that the
blue/red asymmetries of the Ca II 8542 Å line can be due to downward/upward moving cool plasma
in absorption, though theoretically also possible. Finally, in order to further check the possibility
of an absorption cause of the line asymmetries, we also do a test to ﬁt the line proﬁles with a static
component plus a negative shifted component (due to absorption) at the opposite wings. This
ﬁtting fails to yield reasonable results with the ﬁtting errors much larger than the case of a static
component plus a positive shifted component as done in Section 3.1. Considering the above facts,
we think that the blue/red line asymmetries in this ﬂare are caused by upward/downward motions
of heated mass, which are likely related to reconnection outﬂows, as will be discussed below.

As for the cause of the mass ﬂows in a ﬂare, one would naturally think of the possibility of
chromospheric evaporation and condensation. However, we can exclude this possibility for the fol-
lowing reasons. First, the line-of-sight velocity along a slit, derived from the sequence of Hα and
Ca II 8542 Å contrast proﬁles, shows a gradual (nearly linear) variation in magnitude (Fig. 3(a)
and Fig. 4(a)). Such a spatial distribution can hardly be explained by the spatially diﬀerent evap-
orations, but is more likely a result of plasma acceleration. Second, previous observations show
that chromospheric condensation, thought to be responsible for the red asymmetries in Hα pro-

– 7 –

ﬁles, rapidly decreases before the Hα intensity reaches its maximum (Ichimoto & Kurokawa 1984).
But in our event, the Hα red asymmetries seem to exist longer. Third, the most recent radiative
hydrodynamic simulations of solar ﬂares show that the Hα and Ca II 8542 Å lines only exhibit
red asymmetries in response to chromospheric condensation in the early heating phase, but that
they hardly exhibit blue asymmetries responding to chromospheric evaporation containing plasma
of very high temperatures (Rubio da Costa et al. 2015). This is apparently diﬀerent from what are
revealed in our observations, where the red and blue asymmetries appear almost simultaneously in
both chromospheric lines.

3.3. Magnetic Field Extrapolation

The three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld structure of this ﬂare region is constructed using nonlinear
force-free ﬁeld extrapolations with the optimization method (Wheatland et al. 2000; Wiegelmann
2004). The vector magnetic ﬁeld on the bottom boundary comes from the Space-weather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP, Bobra et al. 2014), in which the 180◦ ambiguity of transverse
components has already been removed using the minimum energy method (Leka et al. 2009) and
the projection eﬀect has been corrected (Gary & Hagyard 1990). The data have been remapped
to a heliographic cylindrical equal-area coordinate system. An additional preprocessing is applied
for the vector ﬁeld to meet the force-free and torque-free conditions (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). The
extrapolation box consists of 230 × 200 × 200 uniform grid points in a box, corresponding to a
domain of about 175 × 152 × 152 Mm3.

The extrapolation result shows that, before the ﬂare onset, there exist twisted magnetic ﬁeld
lines above the parasitic polarities, which lie along the polarity inversion line (PIL) and overlap well
with the dark thread-like structure seen in the He I 10830 Å images (Fig. 5). This clearly indicates
the existence of a ﬂux rope in the lower solar atmosphere (Wang et al. 2015). The height of the
ﬂux rope is about 800–1000 km above the solar surface, as judged from both the magnetic structure
and the He I 10830 Å dark threads. Such a low-lying ﬂux rope can serve as a cause of the onset
of the reconnection in the chromosphere by its instabilities (Török & Kliem 2005; Aulanier et al.
2010; Kliem & Török 2006). Note that the ﬂare is a conﬁned one since the ﬂux rope failed to erupt
ﬁnally. And we did not see magnetic ﬂux emergence in the ﬂare region under present resolution.

4. Summary and Discussions

We study a microﬂare based on both high-resolution spectroscopic and imaging observations,
focusing on the observational evidence of magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere. The Hα
contrast proﬁles show obvious excess emission in the red or blue wings, with a Doppler velocity
of ±(70–80) km s−1. The Ca II 8542 Å contrast proﬁles show similar asymmetric patterns with,
however, a slightly lower velocity. Such a diﬀerence could originate from the diﬀerent formation

– 8 –

heights of the two lines (Leenaarts et al. 2012; Cauzzi et al. 2008). Nevertheless, the qualitatively
similar behaviours shown in the two chromospheric lines do suggest that the mass ﬂows lie in the
chromosphere. The co-existence of both upﬂows and downﬂows, located closely in space and with
speeds comparable to the local Alfvén speed, indicates that they are a pair of outﬂows resulting
from the reconnection in the chromosphere.

Previous observations have yielded spectroscopic measurements of reconnection outﬂows. Wang et al.

(2007) showed fast ﬂows with speeds of ∼900–3500 km s−1 in a ﬂare. Redshifted outﬂows of about
125 km s−1 in a ﬂare were also reported (Tian et al. 2014). In addition, Innes et al. (1997) showed
bidirectional outﬂows (∼100 km s−1) in transition region explosive events. In our event, we ﬁnd
bidirectional outﬂows with a Doppler velocity of ±(70–80) km s−1 in the Hα line. From the mag-
netic ﬁeld extrapolation, the ﬂux rope is found to lie at a height of ∼900 km, where the ambient
magnetic ﬁeld is ∼600 G and the mass density is 2.34 × 10−10 g cm−3 if we take the F1 model
of a weak ﬂare (Machado et al. 1980) as a reference model. Then, the local Alfvén speed at the
reconnection site, if just below the ﬂux rope, is calculated to be ∼110 km s−1. The speeds of the
bidirectional outﬂows are then roughly comparable with the local Alfvén speed, indicating that the
outﬂows are most likely driven by the ﬂare-related magnetic reconnection.

Therefore, our results show clear evidence of magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere leading
to the occurrence of a microﬂare. The chain of evidence includes the trigger of reconnection, a
twisted ﬂux rope above the ﬂaring site, and the eﬀect of reconnection, bidirectional outﬂows. In
fact, magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere has been suggested to be the cause of some
small-scale activities like Ellerman bombs (Archontis & Hood 2009; Vissers et al. 2015) and hot
explosions (Peter et al. 2014). Our observations suggest that ﬂare-related magnetic reconnection
can also proceed in the chromosphere. Moreover, we conﬁrm that the basic mechanisms for a
microﬂare are similar to those for a major ﬂare occurring mostly in the corona, regardless of the
quite diﬀerent energies between them.

Fig. 1.— (a) Intensity integrated over the ﬂare region (the FOV in (b)–(g)) as a function of
time. Plotted are the intensities at 94 Å, 304 Å and Hα, normalized to their corresponding values
at the pre-ﬂare time.
(b)–(d) The AIA observations in two EUV channels and the line-of-sight
magnetogram at the ﬂare peak time. (e)–(f) The Hα and Ca II 8542 Å images reconstructed from
the FISS observations at the ﬂare peak time. Also shown in panel (e) are the velocity contour levels
of ±10 km s−1 derived from the bisector method (red for downﬂows and blue for upﬂows). The
small yellow box refers to the ROI for a further study. (g) The He I 10830 Å image from the NIRIS
observations at the ﬂare peak time.

Fig. 2.— Time sequence of Hα net emission spectra. Each sub-panel shows the spectra along a
Y-directed line at a speciﬁc X-position in the ROI. Each row shows the spectra varying with the
X-positions for the same time. Each column shows the spectra varying with time (from bottom
to top) for the same X-position. Redshifts are to the right, and blueshifts are to the left. Colours
represent diﬀerent intensity levels.

Fig. 3.— A sample of Hα contrast proﬁles at the ﬂare peak time (21:07:58 UT). (a) Selected Hα net
emission spectra. Also shown in the right sub-panel is the line-of-sight velocity distribution along
the slit derived from a certain position (marked with a pink box). Each sub-panel corresponds to
a spatial extension of 6′′.4 along the slit, and the spacing between two successive slit positions is
0′′.16. Colors represent diﬀerent intensity levels. (b) Original line proﬁles at the ﬂare peak time
(solid) and before the ﬂare (dashed) at pixel 1 marked in panel (a). (c) Contrast proﬁle (black solid
line) and their two-component ﬁtting (purple dashed line). The main (static) component is shown
in brown dotted line, while the blueshifted/redshifted components are shown in blue/red dotted
lines, respectively. (d) Time evolution of intensities at the red wing (dashed) and the blue wing
(solid), with the integration range of 1 to 2.5 Å and -2.5 to -1 Å from the line center, respectively.
The velocities derived from two-component ﬁttings are shown in diamonds. (e)–(g) The same as
(b)–(d) but for the proﬁle at pixel 2.

Fig. 4.— A sample of Ca II 8542 Å contrast proﬁles at the ﬂare peak time (21:07:58 UT). All the
notations are the same as in Fig. 3. The red and blue line wing intensities in panels (d) and (g) are
integrated from 1 to 1.5 Å and -1.5 to -1 Å from the line center respectively.
