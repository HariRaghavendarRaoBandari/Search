It has been shown in a companion paper that the late time acceleration of the universe can be
accounted for by an extension of the QCD color to a SU (3) invisible sector (IQCD). In this work
we discuss a uniﬁed framework such the scale of dark chiral-breaking dictates both the accelerated
expansion of the universe, and the origin of dark matter. We ﬁnd that the strong and gravitational
dynamics of dark quarks and gluons evolve to eventually form exotic dark stars. We discuss the
dynamical complexity of these dark compact objects in light of dark big bang nucleosynthesis. We
argue how IQCD favors a halo composed of very compact dark neutron stars, strange/quark stars
and black holes, with masses MM ACHO < 10−7M(cid:12). This avoids limit from MACHO and EROS
collaborations as well as limit from clusters. We also discuss possible phenomenological implications
in dark matter searches. We argue that dark supernovae and dark binaries can emit very peculiar
gravitational waves signal testable by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration and future projects dedicated
to these aspects.

INTRODUCTION

While there is experimental evidence that the universe
is accelerating [2, 4–9, 16–18], compelling theoretical ex-
planations and predictions are still under investigation
(see e.g. [10–12]). It is still possible that a pure cosmo-
logical constant can explain the acceleration, but because
of the unnatural ﬁne tuning, it is possible that Dark En-
ergy might be due to a dark dynamical ﬁeld (for a recent
attempt see also [13]), where the phenomenology of these
new ﬁelds may naturally be connected to another unre-
solved problem-dark matter (see e.g. [14]).

In this work, we show that the dynamical model of
dark energy, presented in [15], can naturally predict
dark matter (DM). We will pursue this possibility by
revisiting constraints on the coupling to the visible sector
so as to be simultaneously consistent with dark-matter
and dark energy. The idea of an invisible QCD sector is
strongly motivated by several diﬀerent UV completions
of the standard model and quantum gravity.
For
example E8 × E8 heterotic superstring theory inevitably
leads to the presence of dark gauge sectors. In IIA and
IIB open string theories, the Standard Model can be
completed by intersecting D-branes wrapping n-cycles in
the internal CY3[39]. In this work we take a phenomeno-
logical perspective and simply assume that this dark
sector exists and focus on the cosmological consequences.

In this model, late time acceleration arises from ex-
tending the color sector of QCD to have an “invisible-
copy”, namely GD = SU (3)D. IQCD has similar quan-
tum ﬁeld theoretic properties of QCD, in that it is con-
ﬁning in the IR. We will consider two species of quarks,

up and down quarks, for minimality and a dark chiral
symmetry. It is well known that pions arise as Goldstone
modes associated to Chiral Symmetry Breaking (CSB),
and in turn the microphysical description of CSB, the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio mechanism [24], is a strongly cou-
pled version of superconductivity induced by hard gluon
exchange. A key feature of our DE model uses the same
physics of CSB in the Invisible QCD sector. During
the matter and radiation era, the dark pions and glu-
ons have negligible eﬀects. However, at late times the
interaction energy between the dark pions and gluons
become more signiﬁcant and asymptote a nearly con-
stant energy density, mimicking an eﬀective cosmological
constant. Through the consistency of the coupled ﬁeld
equations, this interaction energy naturally leads to late
time acceleration and we ﬁnd an interesting connection
between the scale of CSB and the scale of DE.

In this work we ﬁnd that IQCD in the context of a dark
Big Bang Nucleosyntheiss context naturally predicts a
dark matter candidate comprising of dark compact ob-
jects, such as an exotica of dark stars. Intriguingly, the
same meV scale of CSB that dictates late time acceler-
ation is also the scale of hadronization of dark quarks.
These quarks hadronize eventually forming dark nuclei
around 1Gyr during the epoch of galaxy formation. We
perform estimates that show the inevitable formation of
exotic dark stars around the (visible) galaxy formation
epoch. The precise structure formation in the dark sec-
tor deserves future numerical investigations beyond the
scope of this paper but we will provide estimations of the
essential astrophysics. We will discuss the observables
our model in light gravitational microlensing constraints.
Finally, we will discuss phenomenological implications of
our model, such as more accurate microlensing experi-

ment, and by-ﬂy anomalies in our solar system.

THE THEORY

The SU (N )D gauge theory we are moving from has a
behavior similar to an invisible copy of QCD, hence the
name. IQCD assumes that in the dark sector chiral sym-
metry is broken at some scale fD corresponding to the
mass of a dark pion (dpion) πD . The gauge coupling
becomes strong at the IR limit, triggering conﬁnement
and chiral symmetry breaking at a scale ΛD. Below
ΛD, the eﬀective theory is described by “pions” which
are pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone bosons associated with the
spontaneously broken global ﬂavor symmetry of the hid-
den sector. At longer wavelengths, conﬁnement still takes
place, but we expect that atoms of DM start forming to-
gether with several other hadronic bound states, which
stand as condensed phases of the invisible sector con-
stituents.

a (x)|πb(cid:105) within the internal Lorentz
tation value of (cid:104)0|J5 I

like axial vector with vanishing temporal component [40].
The symmetry of the vacuum state on the FLRW back-
ground allows us to further reduce (4) to a homogenous

working in a system where the dpion forms as a result
of CSB, the decay constant fD is deﬁned through the
coupling of the axial current to the dpion. In particular,
dpions can be created by the axial isospin currents.

Below we summarize previous results on the homoge-
nous cosmological dynamics of IQCD, showing a ﬁxed
point late-time acceleration of the Universe. Then we
analyze the behavior of dark quarks and gluons on astro-
physical scales, arguing that the invisible sector can also
provide an interesting phenomenologically viable dark
matter candidates.

The equation of motion for the dpion ﬁeld is recovered
varying (6) within the assumption of spatial homogene-
ity. This is plausible, since a previous inﬂationary epoch
of the universe can smooth out the dpion ﬁeld. In the
next section, we show that the dpion ﬁeld remains ho-
mogenous against perturbations.

Using the decomposition in a homogeneous absolute
value (in the internal space) times a space-dependent unit
vector, i.e. πa = ||πa|| na = π(t) na(x), we recover for the
pion ﬁeld

(10)

To gain some insight as to why we might expect to see
late time acceleration, consider the slow roll regime of
the dpion ﬁeld, which is obtained by neglecting the ac-
celeration term. In this approximation, when the dpion
ﬁeld exhibits an inverse scaling with time, π = π0 a−1(t),
the equation of motion reduces to

phase, the eﬀective cosmological constant of which as-

(12)

Supernovae data, which entail at current times H (cid:39)
10−42 GeV, are consistent with the asymptotic value for
the gauge ﬁeld A(cid:39) fD (cid:39) 10−3 eV, the coupling constant
g is assumed to be order unity. This suggests a fascinat-
ing conclusion: cosmic acceleration is the result of CSB
in the dark sector, since it occurs at the same scale of
energy, i.e. MDE (cid:39) fD.

Consistency of the solutions can be checked: conser-
vation of the energy-momentum tensor is achieved, and
a cogent analysis of the attractor behavior of the solu-
tions further corroborates these results. For this purpose,
we focus on the equations of motion for φ and π, and
consider a de Sitter phase of expansion of the Universe
(namely the value of the Hubble parameter is constant,
and actually H = 10−33eV ). We derive for g = λ = 0.1
the numerical value
(φf , πf , Hf ) = (2.17·10−3eV, 2.04·10−3eV, 1.08·10−35eV ).

and

Solving this latter results in a power law acceleration
of the Universe, namely H(t) (cid:39) t−1, provided that
π(t0) = π0 >> fD and, as customary when taking into
account cosmological scalar ﬁelds, the slow roll condition
holds: 3H ˙π (cid:39) V (cid:48) >> ¨π. When the interaction term
Lint = g φ(t) f 2
π(t) between the dpion and the gauge
ﬁeld is considered, we will see that this term persists to
have a nearly constant energy density yielding a negative
pressure equation of state. Finally, it is straightforward
to show that a slightly diﬀerent behavior in the time
dependence of the dpion, i.e. π = π0 a−n(t) with n > 0,
would yield the same late time-behavior H(t) = t−1.

D

Late time acceleration is recovered when the gauge
ﬁeld asymptotically evolves in time as the scale factor
and the pion ﬁeld approach the constant value π (cid:39) fD.
Under customary assumption, we are able to solve for
the coupled system of diﬀerential equations in the con-
ﬁguration space {φ(t), π(t)}, and to ﬁnd solutions consis-
tent with a de Sitter expanding phase.

Both solutions for φ and π monotonically decrease and
converge asymptotically towards values that are propor-
tional to fD; thus their product conspires to provide an

In order to corroborate the analysis reported above,
we show in Fig. 1 results from numerical integrations of
the dynamical system, which are fully consistent with
previous claims.

up to recombination. The coupled system of non-linear dif-

and λ = 1, and the initial conditions on the functions H(0) =

derivatives φ(cid:48)(0)(cid:39) π(cid:48)(0) = 10−5 (eV )2 . Transition from DE to
(dark sector) radiation happens for z (cid:39) 2 (blue line). With
a choice of the coupling constant g an order of magnitude
smaller, transition to DE happens at z (cid:39) 9 (red line).

Short wavelength modes and Dark Matter

We now analyze shorter wavelength modes of the dark
sector to seek a viable Dark Matter scenario.
In the
dark sector, the chiral symmetry is dynamically bro-
ken by non-perturbative eﬀects of dark strong interac-
tions, such that fD is close to the dark QCD scale
ΛD (cid:39) fD (cid:39) 10−3. As a consequence, the dark quarks
˜q will hadronize into dark mesons and baryons with an
eﬀective scale L (cid:39) Λ−1
D (cid:39) 1 mm and are assumed to
be a singlet with respect to the standard model gauge
group[41]. It is the physics of these dark quarks and glu-
ons that will pave the way to a novel perspective on DM
and potential new observational windows for detecting
them.

Let us introduce for minimality only two dark quarks
˜u, ˜d, taken in the fundamental representation of SU (3)D,
and consider the following extension to the Lagrangian:

L˜q = m˜u ¯˜u˜u + m ˜d

¯˜d ˜d + h.c .

(21)

We assume that dark quarks only interact strongly with
each other, i.e no ordinary electromagnetic and weak
channels are present in the hidden sector.

Because the dark electric charge is absent, dark neu-
trons and protons are degenerate bound states with an
eﬀective radius 1 mm. Furthermore, Big Bang Nucle-
osynthesis (BBN) in the dark sector is simpler than the
visible sector. In the visible sector, BBN is crucially con-
nected to the proton to neutron ratio, which is generated
by weak interaction processes after freeze-out. However,
in our scenario there is no dark γ, W, Z and BBN is
catalyzed solely by strong nuclear interactions. Con-
sequently, the reaction chain will simply produce the
most stable dark nuclei with practically 100 % abun-

0.51.05.010.050.0100.0z(cid:45)0.8(cid:45)0.6(cid:45)0.4(cid:45)0.20.00.2wdance. Also, the possibility to produce higher atomic
mass nuclei cannot be neglected [42].

Similar to the visible sector, the highest binding energy
is for He-4, composed of two neutrons and two protons in
the lowest nuclear orbital,1s−1s. This conﬁguration min-
imizes the angular momentum and energy, a well known
fact in nuclear physics. So the dark BBN processes will
proceed as follow:

10−4eV .

1. Dark hadronization at a temperature of 10−3 ÷

2. Formation of dark deuterium (cid:101)D from proton and
3. Formation of dark (cid:102)He-4 from the sequence of reac-

neutron collisions.

, (cid:101)H 3),
, (cid:101)H 3) → (cid:102)He

.

Dark hadronization occurs around a redshift of z (cid:39) 1
for ΛD (cid:39) 10−3 eV, corresponding to 1 Gyrs.
In other
words, dark quarks hadronize around the epoch of galaxy
formation. Compared to WIMP candidates, where the
correct abundance ariises `a la the WIMP miracle, in this
scenario dark quark masses determines the DM mass
density ρDM [43]. For a cold thermal dark halo of ve-
locity v0 (cid:39) 220 km/s the CM energy of ˜He − ˜He are
ECM ∼ 1 keV which is above the scale of dark hadroniza-
tion, ΛD [44]. Thus, dark quarks are practically un-
bounded in thermal collisions and dark QCD is in the
perturbative regime where strong interactions are domi-
nated by quark-gluon exchange.

As the universe continues to cool a thermal halo
of dark Helium could form. However such a halo is
excluded by stringent limits on DM self-interaction cross
section. Direct constraints from galaxy clusters 1E 0657-
56 (Bullet Cluster) put limits of (σ/m)s.c < 1g/cm3 ,
where σ is the dark particle self-cross section, and m
is the dark particle mass[29, 30]. This cross section is
much smaller than a typical QCD cross section, which is
typically larger than σQCD/m (cid:29) 1014g/cm3 [45] .

However, this scenario can be reconciled with the Bul-
let cluster as follows:
If the dark halo of the Bullet
cluster is mostly recombined into compact objects, like
dark stars, the collision probability will be less than for
WIMPs. But, these compact objects would be detected
by gravitational lensing measurements of the galactic
dark halo. Limits recovered by MACHO and EROS
collaborations exclude the prevalence of Massive Com-
pact Halo Objects in our dark halo, with MM ACHO >
10−7 M(cid:12) [31, 32].

In our scenario, it is important to establish that the
formation of exotic dark stars is rapid compared to
standard structure formation. For temperatures higher

5

than the dark conﬁnement scale, dark quarks and glu-
ons are in a dark quark-gluon plasma phase, rapidly
cooling due to thermal Bremsstrahlung. The energy
loss for the thermal Bremsstrahlung contribution is
dEBremsstrahlung/dtdV ∼ n2T 1/2 where n is the quark
density while T is the temperature of the dark thermal
bath. For T > ΛD, this contribution is dominant to
the recombination loss dErec/dtdV ∼ n2T −1/2. For a
system with a temperature T (cid:39) GM m˜q/R much higher
than ΛD, we can estimate the cooling time as

¯Ro, ¯Mo are controlled by electromagnetic interactions
among protons and electrons, while for ¯R, ¯M by dark
strong conﬁnement scale, dark strong coupling and dark
quark mass. The density needed for ordinary and
dark structure formation is almost the same (cid:104)ρ(cid:105) (cid:39)
10−25 gm cm−3.Assuming the structures are formed with
overdensities of the order ρover (cid:39) 100 × (cid:104)ρ(cid:105), the dark
galaxy formation will have to be happen where the dark
density was 1000 times the density of present epoch. In
the dark sector, ¯R > rHubble while the mass needed is
approximately 1040 g. As a consequence, dark structure
formation begins quickly after the Invisible QCD phase
transition, so in redshift z (cid:39) 1 ÷ 10, depending on the
initial conditions (see Fig.1). a system with 3 × 1040 gm
rapidly cools and forms gravitational structures as a frag-
mentation process.

In the following discussion, we will estimate the mass
of dark compact objects in our scenario. As mentioned
above, the dark strong length scale is l (cid:39) 1 mm. Nuclear

reactions can occur through quantum mechanical tun-
neling when the De Broglie wavelength λdeB (cid:39) l × (c/v)
overlap, where v is velocity of colliding particles.
After dark BBN the typical velocities in dark pri-
mordial thermal bath is v (cid:39) 10 ÷ 100 km/s, λdeB (cid:39)
103 ÷ 104l (cid:39) 1 ÷ 10 m. As a consequence, nuclear re-
actions will need an initial momentum of the order of
N ucl (cid:39) 10−3 ÷ 10−4ΛD (cid:39) 10−7 ÷ 10−8 eV. The gravita-
pDM

n ˜N (cid:39) nN , one sees that a dark star is formed with a
much smaller number of dark nucleons relative to or-
dinary stars, N ˜N (cid:39) 10−13 ÷ 10−19NN ; where for or-
dinary stars, a number of NN in a certain radius R is
usually needed for star formation. Furthermore, a star’s
radius and mass rescales with the number of particles
as, RDM /Rordinary (cid:39) [N ˜N /NN ]1/3 (cid:39) 10−4 ÷ 10−5 and

Therefore, dark stars are endowed with small masses and

One could further expect that a dark star life-time to
be much smaller than ordinary ones. We can roughly esti-
star (cid:39)
mate their lifetime of the nuclear burning phase as tDM
M DM /L, where L is the intensity factor parametrizing
the propagation of heat in the dark star, while  ∼ 1% is
the fraction of the rest-mass energy of He-4 available for
nuclear reactions. To calculate L near the core is highly
non-trivial. However, at longer radii, the intensity factor
can be estimate as L (cid:39) R4T 4/((cid:104)σ(cid:105)N ) (cid:39) T 4Rlcol, where
(cid:104)σ(cid:105) is the average opacity in the dark QCD plasma felt by
gluons, lcol ∼ l is the average collision path roughly equal
to the conﬁnement scale, T is the temperature of the dark
star. As a result the estimation of the lifetime,tDM
star, will
be proportional to ΛDM , indirectly entering in all quan-
tities involved such as the radius, temperature, luminos-
ity and cross section. Therefore, tDM
star is expected to be
smaller than ordinary stars by a factor 10−12, i.e around
10−6 yrs. Let us keep in mind that this is a rough order
of magnitude estimate.

An evaluation of the dark star lifetime is strongly de-
pendent on the kind of star and its mass. These aspects
deserve future numerical simulations. However, we ex-
pect that after a Gyr, practically all initial stars will be
converted into stellar remnants. In particular, gravita-
tional pressure cannot be balanced as usual by electronic

6

Fermi pressures as in dwarfs, simply because there are not
dark electrons. On the other hand, these objects are far
from the Schwarzschild limit, so that black hole forma-
tion from dark supernovae is expected to be impossible.
The only counter-pressure to gravity can come from nu-
cleon or quark Fermi pressure. In other words, we expect
that practically all dark stars will be converted to dark
neutron stars of dark quark/strange stars. Eventually,
black holes can be formed by the merging of two dark
neutron stars or dark quark/strange stars, especially in
dark binary systems.
Dark stars have an average mass of 10−14 ÷
10−15 M(cid:12) (cid:39) 1016 ÷ 1017Kg This scale completely avoids
any constraints by MACHO and EROS collaborations. A
halo with so high a frequency of supernovae will be dom-
inated by dark neutron stars, dark strange/quark stars
and black holes. Peculiarly, they will be very compact ob-
jects, the radii of which will be a factor 10−4 smaller than
ordinary radii, i.e rM ACHO (cid:39) 102 ÷ 103 km. As a conse-
quence, dark halos are expected to be mainly composed of
dark neutron stars with a self-collision probability σ/m (cid:39)
π(2rM ACHO)2/MM ACHO ∼ 10−15 ÷ 10−16 cm2/g, esti-
mated as a disk scattering of radius rM ACHO. Thus,
IQCD can also provide a good candidate for DM, com-
posed of very compact heavy objects rather than WIMPs.
Such a rapid star formation will change the dark
galaxy dynamics with respect to ordinary structure
formation. In standard theory, star formation is slower
than formation of the Silk disk, so that spiral galaxies
are formed, while elliptic ones are probably formed
by the merging of spiral ones [33].
In our case, the
situation is diﬀerent. Dark star formation is so fast that
a halo of dark stars is expected to be an elliptic one.
In a broad sense, such compact stars can be thought
of as composite WIMPZILLAs, forming a thermal dark
halo with very small cross sections. This is a crucial
propriety of our DM candidate, otherwise a dark disk
cannot correctly account for the observation of velocity
rotation curves. From velocity rotation curves of our
Galaxy, one can estimate the number of these compact
objects in our dark halo as ¯N = MDM /MDarkStar (cid:39)
1012M(cid:12)/(10−14 ÷ 10−15M(cid:12)) ∼ 1026 ÷ 1027. Naively,
one could estimate the average interdistance of these
objects as dDarkStar (cid:39) (RDH / ¯N 1/3) ∼ 15 kpc/108÷9 ∼
10−4 ÷ 10−5 pc (cid:39) 109 ÷ 108 km, where RDH is the
radius of the dark halo. This estimation is a rough
approximation, because we know that Dark halo mass
is mostly concentrated in a radius of only 4 kpc (90% of
the total mass or so). But it is enough to get an order
of magnitude in order to compare to usual ordinary
numbers.

Indirect hints of such a candidate could be the observa-
tion of objects formed much earlier than predictions from
standard structure formation theory such as supermas-
sive black holes and early supernovae [34]. In fact, the

ﬁrst dark neutron stars can be formed just 10−6 yrs after
the Big Bang, so that they provide an exotic gravitational
seed, favoring, for example, the formation of black holes
at high redshift z ∼ 5 ÷ 10 (old as 0.4 ÷ 1 Gyr).

Our scenario also strongly motivates new experiments
measuring masses of planets and sun in the solar sys-
tem. For instance, high precision measures of masses can
be done with GPS satellites, or by ﬂy anomalies. Let
us note that the presence of our dark objects in the so-
lar system is not ruled-out only by current data. For
instance, we know that the mass of the Earth itself is
roughly 10−6 M(cid:12), measured with a precision of one part
of million, i.e 10−12 M(cid:12) [36]. The average mass of dark
stars is 10−14 ÷ 10−15 M(cid:12), as said before. In principle,
dark stars can be captured in the gravitational poten-
tial of the solar system, and mainly by the Sun. Av-
erage thermal velocity of dark stars is expected to be
v0 (cid:39) 170 ÷ 270 km/s (similarly to WIMPZILLAs) [35].
Their distribution in our solar system can be highly non-
trivial. Hence, they are not easy to be captured by a Sun
and planets after few gravitational scatterings.

However, during several Gyrs, one could imagine that a
subdominant ratio of dark neutron stars or quark/strange
stars were so slowed by several gravitational scatterings
to be captured by a Sun or planets. Therefore, we suggest
measuring their presence by looking for GPS anomalies
of satellites in nearby planets in our solar system. For ex-
ample, it is possible that planets and the Earth itself have
captured dark stars as dark satellites. In particular, it is
possible that a planet could have captured a dark ring
of these objects, similar to the one around Saturn. In-
triguingly, the formation of a ring with 107 dark neutron
stars or quark/strange stars around the Earth could be
detectable in the next generation of experiments. An esti-
mate of the local DM density given by current constrains
on galactic velocity curves is ρDM (cid:39) 0.1 ÷ 1GeV/cm3
[35], with central values 0.3÷ 0.4GeV/cm3 for isothermal
halo, corresponding to a number of dark neutron stars or
dark quark/strange stars in our solar system of 108÷109.
It is reasonable to assume that a ratio 1 ÷ 10% of them
could be bounded in trapped orbits inside the solar sys-
tem, i.e 106 ÷ 108 dark objects. Possible deviations of
masses in our solar system with respect to expectations
could provide a hint in favor of our model.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we analyzed the implications of a dark
QCD sector with a conﬁnement scale ΛD (cid:39) 10−3 ÷
10−4 eV. Continuing the analysis of the model recently
proposed in [15], we have demonstrated that DE can
arise from the dynamical formation of dark strong con-
densates, due to the breaking of a dark chiral symme-
try. On the other hand, the low conﬁnement scale al-
lows the formation of exotic dark stars with a mass of

7
10−14 ÷ 10−15M(cid:12). These objects are so small to be
eluded by present limits from gravitational microlensing
and cluster limits. We are then tempted to dub these
new objects Mini-MACHOs.

We also demonstrated how the current abundance of
DM can be easily recovered without the need of WIMP
miracles or non-thermal mechanisms. This new paradigm
for a unifying picture of DE and DM suggests several ob-
servables with respect to the standard picture. From the
DE side, the dynamical evolution of the condensate en-
ergy density could be detected in future experiments test-
ing late Universe expansion. On the other hand, Mini-
MACHOs could be detected in more accurate microlens-
ing experiments, or searching for by-ﬂy anomalies in our
solar system.
It is interesting that both DE and DM
are governed by the same scale of Dark Chiral Symmetry
Breaking.

Let us comment that our scenario is capable of
predicting gravitational waves signals detectable by
LIGO/VIRGO collaboration in the near future. In fact,
even if the gravitational masses of dark exotic stars are so
small, they are spread out in the dark halo with a much
higher number and density then ordinary stars. In partic-
ular, such as rapid supernovae events in the dark sector
can release characteristic signals with very diﬀerent fea-
tures compared to ordinary supernovae. On the other
hand, the presence of a large number of Mini-MACHOs
in the dark halo can increase the probability of dark bi-
naries emitting gravitational waves.

Of course, a further theoretical question worth address-
ing is: Why does the dark QCD sector contribute to the
vacuum energy while standard QCD is somehow to be
screened by an unknown mechanism? A possible expla-
nation could be related to an unknown UV completion
of our model. Inspired by Ref. [37], we are tempted to
suggest that if the SM is localized on a Brane-world or
a domain wall in higher dimensions while IQCD is local-
ized on a Dark parallel D-Brane-World or Dark domain
wall, the vacuum energy can be diﬀerently subtracted by
diﬀerent D-Brane/Wall tensions or diﬀerent RR or NS-
NS ﬂuxes in the Calabi-Yau internal compactiﬁcations
wrapped by branes.

[39] Also in these models, the presence of dark sectors is usu-
ally requested in order to cancel stringy tadpole anoma-
lies and to introduce discrete symmetries stabilizing
the proton [19]. We also mention that non-perturbative
stringy eﬀects called exotic instantons can lead to inter-
esting implications in particle physics and baryogenesis,
as the generation of a ∆B = 2 eﬀective Majorana mass
term for the neutron [20] Alternatively, a dark copy is
naturally obtained extending the spin connection ω(e)IJ
of General relativity to a larger group G ∼ SU (N ), which
µ
breaks to SU (2)×SU (N −2) where the SU (N −2) factor
is identiﬁed with the dark sector [23]

[40] Models of dark energy with fermion axial condensates

[41] The dark quarks transform in the (3, 1, 1, 1) representa-

have been considered in [21, 22]
tion of G = SU (3)D × SU (3)c × SU (2)L × U (1)Y

[42] For minimality, dark quark masses can be introduced by
hand as free parameters without any inconsistency with
renormalization. On the other hand, the dark IQCD can
be thought as a residual gauge symmetry of a higher
gauge group. In this case, quark masses can be generated
by Higgs mechanisms.

[43] In fact, after the inﬂationary reheating epoch, the num-
ber densities of dark and visible particles are expected
to be the same,
i.e we assume that inﬂaton decays
equally reheat both the dark and visible sector. However,

m(cid:103)He (cid:39) 5 GeV automatically guarantees a current abun-

dance of Cold Dark Matter from Dark BBN if and only if
the inﬂaton ﬁeld will democratically reheat both the ordi-
nary and the dark sectors. In general this hypothesis can
be relaxed. An asymmetric reheating mechanism between
the ordinary sector and IQCD sector can establish diﬀer-
ent initial reheating temperatures among the two sectors.
In fact, the inﬂaton ﬁeld can be coupled diﬀerently with
ordinary SM particles and dark quarks. In this case, the
cosmological scenario can be more complicated. Gener-
ically, for ˜TR < TR, m ˜He is smaller than 5GeV. A dif-
ferent initial reheating mechanism can also signiﬁcantly

inﬂuence the dark BBN history. For DM phenomenol-
ogy, we cannot consider dark quarks lighter than 1 keV
(warm dark matter). These complications are expected
to not relevantly change main results of this section. A
more complete analysis in full generalities deserve future
investigations beyond the purposes of this letter.
[44] As a consequence, ΩDM /Ωb (cid:39) 5 can be accounted for if
m ˜He (cid:39) 5 GeV. The small scale of chiral symmetry break-
ing ΛD (cid:39) 10−3 ÷ 10−4 eV, will give a negligible contribu-
tion to nuclei masses, which implies m ˜He (cid:39) 2mp +2mn (cid:39)
6mu + 6md, i.e m˜u (cid:39) m ˜d (cid:39) 0.3 GeV.
[45] Recall that a Rutherford electromagnetic scattering of
two protons correspond to σe.m/m ∼ 1014g/cm3 and

9

larger for QCD.

[46] Let us remark that there no dark photons in our scenario,
so that dark stars have not a dark electromagnetic lumi-
nosity and electromagnetic scatterings not transit core
heat to external dark star layers. So that, heat can be
only transmitted by strong interactions. For instance a
reheated dark nucleon can exchange dark gluons within
a radius separation from them 1 mm. We expect that this
dramatically changes the structure of dark stars with re-
spect to ordinary stars, but this technical aspect is be-
yond the purpose of this paper.
