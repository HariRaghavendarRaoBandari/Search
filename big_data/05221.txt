NONCOMPACT RCD(0, N ) SPACES WITH LINEAR VOLUME

GROWTH

XIAN-TAO HUANG

Abstract. It’s well known that a non-compact MCP(0, N ) space has at least linear
volume growth. In this paper, we study noncompact MCP(0, N ) spaces and RCD(0, N )
spaces with linear volume growth. One of the main results is that, the diameter of level
sets of a Busemann function grow at most linearly on a noncompact, non-branching
MCP(0, N ) space satisfying the minimal volume growth condition. Another main result
is a splitting theorem at the noncompact end for a non-branching RCD(0, N ) space with
strongly minimal volume growth.

Keywords: MCP(0, N ), RCD(0, N ), Busemann function, linear volume growth.

1. Introduction

Cheeger and Gromoll’s splitting theorem (see [19]) is one of the classical theorems on
manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In their proof, the Busemann function plays
an important role. There are some papers studying the Busemann function on manifolds,
see [35] [36] etc. Note that the deﬁnition of Busemann functions only concerns with
the metric notion. Combining with the notion of curvature bound (especially the Ricci
curvature lower bound), we obtain many interesting properties and applications.

Recently, people are more and more interesting in the study of non-smooth objects. In
the framework of metric measure spaces, there are lots of researches of Ricci curvature
lower bounds.

A notion of ‘Ricci bounded from below by K ∈ R and dimension bounded above by
N ∈ [1,∞]’ for general metric measure spaces is the so-called CD(K, N )-condition, which
is introduced independently by Lott and Villani ([30]) and by Sturm ([40] [41]). For
N ∈ [1,∞), the CD(K, N ) condition is compatibe with the Riemannian case and the
space of CD(K, N ) spaces is stable under the measured-Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence.
In particular, they include Ricci-limit spaces (see [16] [17] [18]). Note that the metric
measure space (RN , dk·k,LN ), where dk·k is the distance induced by some norm k · k and
LN is the N -dimensional Lebesgue measure, always satisﬁes CD(0, N ) (see p.926 in [42] for
a proof). Hence it is impossible to show a splitting theorem for a general CD(0, N ) space.
We remark that there is a so-called reduced curvature-dimension condition, denoted by
CD∗(K, N ), introduced by Bacher and Sturm ([11]). For the case K = 0, CD(0, N ) and
CD∗(0, N ) conditions are equivalent. There is another weaker version of Ricci curvature
lower bound, called MCP(K, N ) condition (see [33] [41]). The CD(K, N ) condition implies
the MCP(K, N ) condition.

Recently, some stronger notions of RCD(K,∞) spaces (see [6] [8]) and RCD(K, N )
spaces (see [2] [20] [22] etc.) were introduced. Indeed, an RCD(K, N ) spaces is a metric
measure space which is both a CD(K, N ) and an RCD(K,∞) space. Ricci-limit spaces are
examples of RCD(K, N ) spaces, splitting theorem holds for Ricci-limit spaces by Cheeger
and Colding [15]. Alexandrov spaces are also examples of RCD(K, N ) spaces. An isometric
splitting for Alexandrov spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature is established by Zhang

XIAN-TAO HUANG

and Zhu in [44], where ‘non-negative Ricci curvature’ for Alexandrov spaces is deﬁned by
the authors in the same paper. The splitting theorem on general RCD(0, N ) spaces is
proved by Gigli:

Theorem 1.1 (Gigli, [24] [25]). Let (X, d, m) be an RCD(0, N ) space containing a line.
Then (X, d, m) is isomorphic to the product of the Euclidean line (R, dEucl,L1) and another
space (X ′, d′, m′). Moreover,

(1) if N ≥ 2, then (X ′, d′, m′) is a RCD(0, N − 1) space;
(2) if N ∈ [1, 2), then X ′ is just a point.
We note that the Busemann function also plays an important role in the proof of

Theorem 1.1.

Since MCP(K, N ) space satisfy Bishop-Gromov volume comparison estimate, it is not
hard to prove that a noncompact MCP(0, N ) space has at least linear volume growth,
see Proposition 2.8.
It is interesting to study noncompact metric measure spaces with
‘nonnegative Ricci curvature’ and linear volume growth, which is the aim of this paper.
It turns out that the Busemann function associated to some geodesic ray also plays an
important role in the study.

The following theorem is one of our main results:

Theorem 1.2. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N ) space sat-
isfying the minimal volume growth condition (4.1), and b is the Busemann function asso-
ciated to a geodesic ray γ. Then the diameter of the level sets b−1(r) grow at most linearly,
i.e.,

In particular, b−1(r) is compact.

R→+∞

diam(b−1(R))

< ∞.

Theorem 1.2 generalizes Theorem 19 in Sormani’s paper [36].
Our next main result is about noncompact RCD(0, N ) with minimal volume growth.
Following [35], we introduce a notion of strongly minimal volume growth in Deﬁnition 5.1,
and then obtain a splitting theorem at the noncompact end for the RCD(0, N ) space with
strongly minimal volume growth.

Theorem 1.3. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching RCD(0, N ) space and
satisﬁes the strongly minimal volume growth (see Deﬁnition 5.1), then (X, d, m) has only
one end and there is some metric measure space (X ′, d′, ν′) such that the one of the fol-
lowing holds:

c = m(b−1([r0, r0 + 1]));

(1) if X ′ has exactly one point, then (X, d, m) is isomorphic to ([0,∞), dEcul, cL1) with
(2) if X ′ has more than one point, then N ≥ 2, and (X ′, d′, m′) is a compact connected
RCD(0, N −1) space, and (b−1((r0,∞)), d) is locally isometric to (X ′×(r0,∞), d′×
dEcul). Furthermore, let r1 = r0 + diam(X ′)
, then (b−1((r1,∞)), d, m) is isomorphic
to (X ′ × (r1,∞), d′ × dEcul, ν′ ⊗ L1).

2

local isometric cannot be replaced by isometric, see the following example.

Theorem 1.3 generalizes Corollary 10 in [35] to non-smooth setting.
We remark that the conclusion that (b−1((r0,∞)), d) and (X ′ × (r0,∞), d′ × dEcul) are
Let S2 ֒→ R3 be the unit sphere equipped with the round metric ground, and τ :
S2 → S2 is the standard inversion τ (x1, x2, x3) = (−x1,−x2,−x3), which is an isome-
try of (S2, ground). Suppose (S2 × R, gcyl = ground + dr2) is the standard metric on the

cylinder, then σ : (S2 × R, gcyl) → (S2 × R, gcyl), σ((x, r)) = (τ (x),−r) is obviously an
isometry. Denote the quotient space by (X, gX ), and we denote [(x, r)] ∈ X the quo-

tient point of (x, r) and σ((x, r)).
is a well-deﬁned Busemann function. Let r0 = 1
10 . Note that X inherits a metric
measure structure (X, dX , mX) from (X, gX ), and b−1((r0,∞)) inherit the metric mea-
sure structure (b−1((r0,∞)), dX , mX ) as a subspace of X. Similarly, S2 × (r0,∞) inher-
its a metric measure structure (S2 × (r0,∞), dcyl, mcyl) from (S2 × (r0,∞), gcyl). Ob-
viously, (b−1((r0,∞)), gX ) is isometric to the half cylinder (S2 × (r0,∞), gcyl) as Rie-
mannian manifolds, but this only induces a local isometry between (b−1((r0,∞)), dX ) and
5 ), (−x, 1
(S2 × (r0,∞), dcyl). In fact we have dX ([(x, 1
5 ))
for any x ∈ S2.
One important tool in this paper is the disintegration formula. Any 1-Lipschitz function
ϕ will give rise to an equivalence relation on the so-called transport set T , such that each
equivalence class is a geodesic ray. Then one can establish a disintegration formula with
respect to this equivalence relation. Bianchini and Cavalletti have obtained very general
results in [9], especially there are results on non-branching MCP(K, N ). Since Busemann
functions are special 1-Lipschitz functions, we can apply the results in [9]. Under the
noncompact assumption and non-branching assumption, we have a good monotonicity
formula for the volume growth of level sets of the Busemann function, see Proposition
3.21. Using the volume comparison properties we can prove Theorem 1.2.

5 < π = dcyl((x, 1

5 )], [(−x, 1

5 )]) = 2

We remark that recently Gigli and De Philippis have proved that ‘volume cone implies
metric cone’ in the setting of RCD(K, N ) spaces in a preprint [26]. The proof is very
involved and lengthy, and it relies on the tools and results recently developed in [22], [23]
[27] etc. In Section 5, we will prove that the strongly minimal volume growth condition
will implies that there is a measure preserving map from (b−1((r0,∞)), m) to some (X ′ ×
R+, m′ ⊗ L1) (see Proposition 5.3). Hence Theorem 1.3 is essentially a ‘volume cone
implies metric cone’-type theorem in the setting of noncompact RCD(0, N ). Most of our
remaining arguments in the proof of Theorem 1.3 follow the strategy in [26] closely.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Metric measure space. Throughout this paper, we will always assume the metric
measure space (X, d, m) we consider satisﬁes the following: (X, d) is a complete separable
length space, and m is a nonnegative Radon measure with respect to d and ﬁnite on
bounded sets, supp(m) = X.

A metric space (X, d) is called a length space if d(x, y) = inf L(γ) for all x, y ∈ X, where
the inﬁmum runs over all curves γ in X connecting x and y, and L(γ) means the length
of the curve γ. A curve γ : [0, T ] → X is called a geodesic provided d(γs, γt) = L(γ|[s,t])
for every [s, t] ⊂ [0, T ].
(X, d) is called a geodesic space if every two points x, y ∈ X
are connected by a geodesic γ. A length space which is complete and locally compact is
always a geodesic space.

(X, d) is called non-branching provided any two diﬀerent geodesics γ1, γ2 : [0, 1] → X
with γ1(0) = γ2(0), γ1(1) = γ2(1) must satisfy γ1((0, 1)) ∩ γ2((0, 1)) = ∅ and they are not
a part of a longer geodesic.

4

XIAN-TAO HUANG

Let Geo(X) ⊂ Lip([0, 1], X) be the set of all geodesics with domain [0, 1]. We equip

Lip([0, 1], X) with the uniform topology. Deﬁne the evaluation map et(γ) by

e : [0, 1] × Geo(X) → X
et(γ) 7→ γ(t).

It is obvious that et(γ) is continuous.

A map γ : [0,∞) → X is called a geodesic ray if for any T > 0 its restriction to [0, T ]
is a geodesic. A map γ : R → X is called a line if for any s, t ∈ R. d(γs, γt) = |s − t|. We
will always assume that geodesic rays and lines are parametrized by unit speed.
Two metric measure spaces (X1, d1, m1), (X2, d2, m2) with supp(m1) = X1, supp(m2) =
X2, are said to be isomorphic provided there exists an isometry T : (X1, d1) → (X2, d2)
such that T∗m1 = m2.
We denote by B(X) the space of all Borel sets in X. Denote by P(X) the space of Borel
probability measures on X, and P2(X) ⊂ P(X) the space of Borel probability measures
ξ satisfying RX d2(x, y)ξ(dy) < ∞ for some (and hence all) x ∈ X.
A set A ⊂ X is called an analytic set if there exists a Polish space Y and B ∈ B(X × Y )
such that A = P1(B). A set A ⊂ X is said to be coanalytic if it is the complement of an
analytic set. The projective class Σ1
1(X) is the space of all analytic subsets in X, and the
coprojective class Π1
1(X) is the space of all coanalytic subsets in X. Souslin proved that
1(X) ∩ Π1
Σ1
1(X). It can be
proved that every set A ∈ A(X) is universally measurable, i.e. for any Borel measures µ
on X, there exist Borel sets B, B′ such that B ⊂ A ⊂ B′ and µ(B′ \ B) = 0. Thus every
Borel measures µ can be extended to deﬁne on A(X), and we will still use µ to denote
this measure. See Chapter 4 of [37] for more about analytic and coanalytic sets.

1(X) = B(X). Denote by A(X) the σ-algebra generated by Σ1

2.2. Calculus on metric measure spaces. Given a function f ∈ C(X), the pointwise
Lipschitz constant ([14]) of f at x is deﬁned as

lip(f )(x) := lim sup

y→x

|f (x) − f (y)|

d(x, y)

∈ [0, +∞]

if x is not isolated, and put lip(f )(x) = 0 if x is isolated.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let π ∈ P(C([0, 1], X)). We say that π is a test plan if
(1) there exist a constant C > 0 such that (et)∗π ≤ Cm, ∀t ∈ [0, 1],
(2) R R 1

0 | ˙γt|2dtdπ(γ) < ∞.
According to the convention R 1

test plan must be concentrated on absolutely continuous curves.

0 | ˙γt|2dt = +∞ provided γ is not absolutely continuous, any

Deﬁnition 2.2 (see [4]). The Sobolev class S2(X) is the space of all Borel functions
f : X → R for which there is a nonnegative function G ∈ L2(X) such that

Z |f (γ1) − f (γ0)|dπ(γ) ≤ Z Z 1

0

G(γt)| ˙γt|dtdπ(γ)

for every test plan π. Any such G is called weak upper gradient for f . For f ∈ S2(X)
there exists a minimal G in the m-a.e. sense, which is called minimal weak upper gradient
and will be denoted by |Df|.

The Sobolev space W 1,2(X) is deﬁned as L2(X) ∩ S2(X) and is equipped with the norm

k f k2

W 1,2:=k f k2

L2 + k |Df| k2

We deﬁne S2

loc(X) (resp. W 1,2

loc (X)) to be the space of functions locally equal to some
function in S2(X) (resp. W 1,2(X)). For U ⊂ X open, we deﬁne S2(U ) (resp. W 1,2(U )))
to be the space of functions locally in U equal to some function in S2(X) (resp. W 1,2(X))
such that |Df| ∈ L2(U ) (resp. f,|Df| ∈ L2(U )). We can also deﬁne the spaces S2
loc(U ) or
W 1,2

loc (U ).
Note that every Lipschitz function f belongs to W 1,2

loc (X) and satisﬁes

|Df| ≤ lip(f ),

m-a.e..

The equality may not hold for general metric measure space. However, by the results in
[14] and [4], if (X, d, m) provides a local doubling property and a weak local (1, 1)-Poincar´e
inequality, then for any Lipschitz function f , |Df| = lip(f ), m-a.e..

The Dirichlet energy E : L2(X) → [0,∞] is deﬁned to be

(2.1)

E(f ) := (cid:26) 1

+∞,

if f ∈ W 1,2(X);
otherwise.

Deﬁnition 2.3. (X, d, m) is called an inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian space if W 1,2(X) is an
Hilbert space.

On an inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian space (X, d, m), for any f, g ∈ S2

loc(X), the map

h∇f,∇gi : X → R is m-a.e. deﬁned to be
h∇f,∇gi := inf

ǫ>0

|D(g + ǫf )|2 − |Dg|2

2ǫ

,

where the inﬁmum is in m-essential sense. Obviously, h∇f,∇fi = |Df|2. The inﬁnitesimal
Hilbertianity make the map S2(X) ∋ f, g 7→ h∇f,∇gi ∈ L1(X) bilinear and symmetric.
Furthermore, h∇f,∇gi satisﬁes the chain rule and Leibniz rule (see [22]).
Deﬁnition 2.4. A test plan π is said to represent the gradient of f ∈ S2(X) provided
0 | ˙γs|2dsdπ(γ).

Notice that the opposite inequality always holds. If f is only in S2(U ) for some open set
U , we add the requirement that (et)∗π is concentrated on U for every t ∈ [0, 1] suﬃciently
small.

The following ﬁrst order diﬀerentiation formula is very important, see [22]:

Theorem 2.5. Suppose (X, d, m) is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian, f, g ∈ S2(U ) for some open
set U ⊂ X and π is a test plan represents the gradient of f . Then

Given an open set U ⊂ X, D(∆, U ) ⊂ W 1,2

(2.3)

Z gdµ = −Z h∇f,∇gidm

holds for any g : X → R Lipschitz with supp(g) ⊂⊂ U . If (X, d, m) is an inﬁnitesimally
Hilbertian, then µ is unique and we shall denote it by ∆f|U . In case U = X we simply
write g ∈ D(∆) and µ = ∆g.

6

XIAN-TAO HUANG

The space D(∆) ⊂ W 1,2(X) is the space of functions f for which there is a function in

L2(X), called the Laplacian of f and denoted by ∆f , such that

(2.4)

Z g∆f dm = −Z h∇f,∇gidm,

∀g ∈ W 1,2(X).

If (X, d, m) is a proper inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian space, then by Proposition 4.24 in
[22], for any f ∈ W 1,2(X), f ∈ D(∆) if and only if f ∈ D(∆) with ∆f = hm for some
h ∈ L2(X, m). Furthermore, if this holds then we have h = ∆f .
In [23], the notions of tangent and cotangent modules of a metric measure space
(X, d, m) are introduced. Denote the tangent and cotangent modules by L2(T X) and
L2(T ∗X) respectively. The pointwise norm on both spaces will be denoted by | · |. The
diﬀerential of a function f ∈ W 1,2(X) is an element df ∈ L2(T ∗X) deﬁned in Section
2.2.2 of [23]. The diﬀerential operator d satisﬁes the locality property, chain rule and
Leibniz rule. For f ∈ W 1,2(X), |df| = |Df| holds m-a.e..
In case X is inﬁnitesimally
Hilbertian, the gradient ∇f ∈ L2(T X) of f ∈ W 1,2(X) is the unique element associated
to the diﬀerential df via the Riesz isomorphism for modules.
Let Y = C([0, 1], X) equipped with the sup distance dY and a test plan π ∈ P(Y )
as reference measure. Note that (et)∗π ≤ Cm for every evaluation map et. We can
: L2(T X) →
consider the pullback module L2(T X, et, π) and the pullback operator e∗
t
L2(T X, et, π). See Section 1.6 of [23] for related notions. By deﬁnition, elements of the
t v, v ∈ L2(T X), generates L2(T X, et, π) in the sense of modules and it holds that
form e∗
|e∗
t v| = |v| ◦ et π-a.e.. We have the following result:
Theorem 2.6 (Theorem 2.3.18 in [23]). Let (X, d, m) be a proper inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian
metric measure space, and π ∈ P(C([0, 1], X)) a test plan. Then for a.e. t ∈ [0, 1] there
exists a unique element π′

t ∈ L2(T X, et, π) such that for every f ∈ W 1,2(X) we have

Let (X1, d1, m1), (X2, d2, m2) be two metric measure spaces. Suppose F : X1 → X2 is
an invertible Lipschitz map such that c ≤ Lip(F ) ≤ C and cm2 ≤ F∗m1 ≤ Cm2 for some
constants 0 < c ≤ 1 ≤ C, then the diﬀerential dF : L2(T X1) → L2(T X2) is well deﬁned:
for any v ∈ L2(T X1), dF (v) is charaterized by
(2.6)

(cid:0)dϕ(dF (v))(cid:1) ◦ F = d(ϕ ◦ F )(v) m1-a.e. ∀ϕ ∈ W 1,2(X2).

For the deﬁnition we immediately obtain

(2.7)

|dF (v)| ◦ F ≤ Lip(F )|v|, m1-a.e..

See Section 3.6.1 in [26] for more basic properties of dF (see also Section 2.4 in [23] for
some more general presentation for the diﬀerential of a map).

The space D(div) ⊂ L2(T X) is the set of all vector ﬁelds V for which there exists

f ∈ L2(X) such that

Z f gdm = −Z dg(V )dm,

∀g ∈ W 1,2(X).

f is uniquely characterized, we call it the divergence of V and denote it by div(V ). The
Leibniz rule holds for the divergence. Suppose (X, d, m) is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian,
f ∈ W 1,2(X), then ∇f ∈ D(div) iﬀ f ∈ D(∆), and in this holds, we have div(∇f ) = ∆f .
See Section 2.3.3 in [23] for more details about the divergence.

2.3. MCP(K, N ) spaces. A dynamical transference plan Ξ is a Borel probability measure
on Geo(X), and the path {ξt}t∈[0,1] ⊂ P2(X) given by ξt = (et)∗Ξ is called a displacement
interpolation associated to Ξ. For K ∈ R, deﬁne the function sK : [0, +∞) → R (on
[0, π/√K) if K > 0) as

and let N ∈ N.
Deﬁnition 2.7. We say a metric measure space (X, d, m) satisﬁes the (K, N )-measure
contraction property (MCP(K, N )) if for every point x ∈ X and m-measurable set A ⊂ X
with η(A) ∈ (0,∞) there exists a displacement interpolation {ξt}t∈[0,1] associated to a
dynamical transference plan Ξ = Ξx,A satisfying the following:

(1) ξ0 = δx and ξ1 = 1
m(A) m|A;
(2) for every t ∈ [0, 1], we have

(2.9)

dm ≥ (et)∗(cid:18)t(cid:26) sK(td(x, γ(1))/√N − 1)

sK(d(x, γ(1))/√N − 1) (cid:27)N −1

m(A)dΞ(γ)(cid:19).

If (X, d, m) is an MCP(K, N ) space for N ∈ [1,∞), then by [33] (or [41]), the Bishop-
Gromov volume comparison estimate holds. Furthermore, we can derive that (X, d) is
locally compact, hence it is geodesic. In particular, for an MCP(0, N ) space (X, d, m), we
have

(2.10)

m(Bx(r))
m(Bx(R)) ≥

∀x ∈ X, 0 ≤ r ≤ R.

(2.11)

,

∀x ∈ X, 0 ≤ r ≤ R.

An interesting application of (2.11) is Proposition 2.8. Proposition 2.8 generalizes the
famous theorem on noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature proved inde-
pendently by Calabi [12] and Yau [43].
Proposition 2.8. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact MCP(0, N ) space with N ≥ 1, then
X has at least linear volume growth. More explicitly, for every p ∈ X, there exists a
constant C depending only on m(Bp(1)) and N such that

Proof. Let x ∈ ∂Bp(1 + r), then we have Bp(1) ⊂ Bx(2 + r) \ Bx(r) and Bx(2 + r) ⊂
Bp(3 + 2r). Thus we have

m(Bp(r)) ≥ Cr.

(2.12)

(2.13)

m(Bp(1)) ≤ m(Bx(2 + r)) − m(Bx(r)),

m(Bx(2 + r)) ≤ m(Bp(3 + 2r)).

8

XIAN-TAO HUANG

On the other hand, by (2.11), we have

(2.14)

m(Bx(2 + r)) − m(Bx(r)) ≤ m(Bx(2 + r))

Combining (2.12), (2.13) and (2.14), we obtain

(2 + r)N − rN

(2 + r)N

.

m(Bp(3 + 2r)) ≥ m(Bp(1))

(2 + r)N

(2 + r)N − rN ≥ Cr

and ﬁnish the proof.
2.4. CD(0, N ) spaces and RCD(0, N ) spaces. For N ∈ (1,∞) we deﬁne the functional
UN : P2(X) → [−∞, 0] to be

and for N = 1, we deﬁne U1 : P2(X) → [−∞, 0] to be

U1(µ) := −m({ρ > 0}), µ = ρm + µs, µs⊥m.

For every B ⊂ X Borel and bounded, the restriction of UN to the measures concentrated

on B is lower semicontinuous w.r.t. weak convergence.
Deﬁnition 2.9. Let N ∈ [1,∞), a metric measure space (X, d, m) is said a CD(0, N )
space provided for any µ0, µ1 ∈ P2(X) with bounded support, there exists a geodesic
{µt}t∈[0,1] ⊂ P2(X) connecting them such that

UN ′(µt) ≤ (1 − t)UN ′(µ0) + tUN ′(µ1),

∀t ∈ [0, 1],

for every N ′ ∈ [N,∞).
Deﬁnition 2.10. A CD(0, N ) space which is also inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian is called an
RCD(0, N ) space.

We review some useful results on RCD(0, N ) spaces in the following. In fact similar
results are valid for general RCD(K, N ) spaces, but we state them for RCD(0, N ) spaces
for simplicity.

with |Df| ≤ 1 m-a.e. admits a 1-Lipschitz representative (see [6] [24]).

An RCD(0, N ) space always has the Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property, i.e. any f ∈ W 1,2(X)
On an RCD(0, N ) space we consider the following space of test functions:
Test(X) := {f ∈ D(∆) | f,|Df| ∈ L∞(X), ∆f ∈ W 1,2(X)}.

Test(X) is dense in W 1,2(X).

On an RCD(0, N ) space (X, d, m), E is a quadratic form. By the theory of gradient
ﬂows of convex functions on Hilbert spaces (see e.g. [3] for a comprehensive presentation),
the heat ﬂow ht : L2(X) → L2(X), t ≥ 0 is the unique family of maps such that for
any f ∈ L2(X) the curve t 7→ ht(f ) ∈ L2(X) is continuous on [0,∞), locally absolutely
continuous on (0,∞), and fulﬁlls h0(f ) = f , ht(f ) ∈ D(∆) for every t > 0, and

The following lemma can be found in [26] (see also [1] [32]), which provides cut-oﬀ

functions with quantitative estimates on RCD(0, N ).

Lemma 2.11. Suppose (X, d, m) is an RCD(0, N ) space. For every r > 0 there exists
a constant C(r) > 0 such that the following holds. Given K ⊂ U ⊂ X with K compact
and U open such that inf x∈K,y∈U c d(x, y) ≥ r, there exists a test function χ with values in
[0, 1], which is 1 on K, with supp(χ) ⊂⊂ U and satisfying
Lip(χ)+ k ∆χ kL∞≤ C(r).

For an RCD(0, N ) space (X, d, m), the notion of second order Sobolev space W 2,2(X)
can be introduced as in [23]. Since L2(T ∗X) is a Hilbert module, we can deﬁne the Hilbert
tensor product L2((T ∗)⊗2X). See Section 1.5 in [23] for related notions.
Deﬁnition 2.12. A function f ∈ W 1,2(X) is belong to W 2,2(X) provided there is an
element of L2((T ∗)⊗2X), called the Hessian of f and denoted by Hess(f ), such that for
any g1, g2, h ∈ Test(X) it holds
(2.19)

2Z hHess(f )(∇g1,∇g2) =Z (cid:2)−h∇f,∇g1idiv(h∇g2) − h∇f,∇g2idiv(h∇g1)

W 2,2(X) is equipped with the norm

− hh∇f,∇(h∇g1,∇g2i)i(cid:3)dm.
W 2,2:= Z (cid:0)|f|2 + |Df|2 + |Hess(f )|2(cid:1)dm,

k f k2

which make it a separable Hilbert space.

It’s proved in [23] that D(∆) ⊂ W 2,2(X) and thus W 2,2(X) is dense in W 1,2(X).
Hessian satisﬁes the chain rule and Leibniz rule as well as the locality property, see

Propositions 3.3.20 to 3.3.24 in [23] for precise statements.

By the locality property of Hess, given an open subset U , we deﬁne W 2,2(U ) as the
loc (X) consists of functions f for which there is Hess(f ) ∈ L2((T ∗)⊗2X)

subspace of W 1,2
such that (2.19) holds for any g1, g2, h ∈ Test(X) with support in U .

Finally, let’s recall a useful approximation lemma:

Lemma 2.13. If f ∈ W 1,2(X) satisﬁes supp(f ) ⊂ U , where U is an open set, then there
exists a sequence of test functions fi such that supp(fi) ⊂⊂ U , ∆fi ∈ L∞(X) and fi
converging to f in W 1,2(X).

Lemma 2.13 is well-known to experts. We sketch its proof for completeness. Since X
is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian, we only need to prove there exists a sequence {fj} with
the required good properties converging to f in the relaxed sense, i.e. fj → f and
|Dfj| → |Df| are both in L2(X) sense.
Assume for the moment that f is Lipschitz with bounded support contained in U ,
smoothing f via the heat ﬂow and then mollifying in the time direction as in (3.2.3) of
[23], we obtain that there is a sequence of test functions { ˜fj} converging to f in the

10

XIAN-TAO HUANG

relaxed sense such that | ˜fj|, |D ˜fj| are uniformly bounded, and ∆ ˜fj ∈ L∞(X) for every j.
Then choose a good cut-oﬀ function χ ∈ Test(X) as in Lemma 2.11 such that χ(x) = 1
if x ∈ supp(f ), χ(x) = 0 if x /∈ U and Lip(χ)+ k ∆χ kL∞≤ C. Then it is easy to
check fj := χ ˜fj converge to f in the relaxed sense, and |fj|, |Dfj| are uniformly bounded,
∆fj ∈ L∞(X) for every j.
For general f ∈ W 1,2(X), it was proved that Lipschitz functions are dense in the
relaxed sense (see Lemma 4.3 in [4]), then by a truncation argument (e.g. see the proof of
Proposition 4.24 in [22]), we can prove that for f ∈ W 1,2(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ U , f can be
approximated by a sequence of Lipschitz function ¯fj with bounded support contained in
U in the relaxed sense. Combining this with the conclusion in the proceeding paragraph,
we can complete the proof of Lemma 2.13.

2.5. Disintegration.
Deﬁnition 2.14. Suppose (X, Ω, µ) and (Y, Σ, ν) are measure spaces, and f : X → Y is a
measurable map. A disintegration of µ over ν consistent with f is a map ρ : Ω×Y → [0,∞]
such that

(1) ρy(·) is a measure on (X, Ω) for every y ∈ Y ,
(2) ρ·(C) is ν-measurable for all C ∈ Σ,
(3) the consistency condition

µ(B ∩ f −1(C)) = ZC

ρy(B)ν(dy)

holds for all B ∈ Ω, C ∈ Σ.

We say that the disintegration is unique if ρ1, ρ2 are two consistent disintegrations then

ρ1,y(·) = ρ2,y(·) for ν-a.e. y ∈ Y .

A disintegration is strongly consistent with f if ρy(X \ f −1(y)) = 0 holds for ν-a.e. y.
We recall the following version of the disintegration theorem which can be found in [21]

(see 452G and 452I) or [10] (see Theorem A.7).

Theorem 2.15 (Disintegration of measures). Supppose (X, Ω, µ) and (Y, Σ, ν) are mea-
sure spaces such that (X, Ω, µ) is a Radon space and (Y, Σ) is countably separated. Suppose
there is an an inverse-measure-preserving map f : X → Y , then there exists a unique dis-
integration y 7→ ρy over ν strongly consistent with f .

We recall that a measurable space (X, Ω) is countably separated if there is a countable
set Υ ⊂ Ω such that for any distinct x, y ∈ X there is some E ∈ Υ such that x ∈ E and
y /∈ E.
Let (X, Ω, µ) and (Y, Σ, ν) be measure spaces, a map f : X → Y is called inverse-
measure-preserving provided for any Q ∈ Σ, it holds f −1(Q) ∈ Ω and ν(Q) = µ(f −1(Q)).

3. Busemann function and disintegration revisited

In this section, the metric measure space (X, d, m) is always assumed to be noncom-
pact, non-branching and satisfying the MCP(K, N ) condition. Note that (X, d) is locally
compact and geodesic.

By the triangle inequality, we are easy to see

Firstly, let’s recall some classical notions about Busemann functions.
Given a geodesic ray γ emitted from p, for any t ≥ 0, denote by bt(x) := t − d(x, γt).
(1) given any x ∈ X, the function t 7→ bt(x) is non-decreasing;
(2) bt(x) ≤ d(x, p) for all t ≥ 0.

NONCOMPACT RCD(0, N ) SPACES WITH LINEAR VOLUME GROWTH

11

We deﬁne the Busemann function associated to γ as

b(x) := lim

t→+∞

bt(x).

Note that the converge is uniform on any given compact sets.

Since bt(x) are all 1-Lipschitz functions, b is also 1-Lipschitz.
For any given x ∈ X, let γt,x : [0, d(x, γt)] → X be a unit speed geodesic connecting x
to γt, where t ≥ 0. By the properness of X, there is a sequence {tn}, with tn → ∞, such
that γtn,x converge on compact sets to a geodesic ray γx : [0,∞) → X with γx(0) = x.
Such a ray γx is called a Busemann ray associated with γ. We note that diﬀerent choice
of sequences {tn} may give diﬀerent Busemann rays.
Lemma 3.1. For every t ≥ 0, we have

b(γx(t)) = b(x) + t.

Proof. Suppose γtn,x : [0, d(x, γtn )] → X converge uniformly on compact sets to γx :
[0,∞) → X. Then γtn,x(t) converge to γx(t). Thus
(tn − d(γx(t), γ(tn)))

b(γx(t)) = lim
n→∞

= lim
n→∞
= lim
n→∞

[tn − d(γtn,x(t), γ(tn)) + (d(γtn,x(t), γ(tn)) − d(γx(t), γ(tn)))]
(tn − d(x, γ(tn))) + t = b(x) + t,

and we ﬁnish the proof.

(cid:3)

For any s ∈ R, we denote Ωs := {x ∈ X | b(x) > s}. Thus ∂Ωs = b−1(s). For c < d, we

denote the set {x ∈ X | b(x) ∈ [c, d]} by Ω[c,d].
Lemma 3.2. For any s ∈ R, Ωs is path-connected and connected. More precisely, any
two points x, y ∈ Ωs can be connected by a Lipschitz curve σ ⊂ Ωs.
Proof. We only need to prove that any x ∈ Ωs can be connected to γs+1 by a Lipschitz
curve σ ⊂ Ωs. Firstly, γx(t) ⊂ Ωs connects x and y = γx(1), with b(y) ≥ s + 1. Since
b(y) = limt→∞(t−d(y, γt)), we ﬁnd ˜t suﬃciently large such that b˜t(y) = ˜t−d(y, γ˜t) > s+ 1
2 .
Let ˜σ : [0, d(y, γ˜t)] → X be a unit speed geodesic connecting y to γ˜t. Then for any
r ∈ [0, d(y, γ˜t)], we have b˜t(˜σ(r)) = b˜t(y) + r. Thus b(˜σ(r)) ≥ b˜t(˜σ(r)) > s + 1
2 for any
r ∈ [0, d(y, γ˜t)]. So ˜σ ⊂ Ωs connects y and γ˜t. Finally, γ itself is a curve connecting γ˜t and
γs+1. Glue the above geodesics to form a Lipschitz curve and we complete the proof. (cid:3)
Lemma 3.3. Suppose s1 < s2 and x1 ∈ b−1(s1), x2 ∈ b−1(s2), then d(x1, x2) ≥ s2 − s1.
Proof. Suppose on the contrary, d(x1, x2) < s2 − s1. Since b is 1-Lipschitz, we have
s2 − s1 = b(x2) − b(x1) ≤ d(x1, x2) < s2 − s1, which is a contradiction.

(cid:3)

On the other hand, suppose s1 < s2 and x ∈ b−1(s1), since γx([0,∞)) ∩ b−1(s2) =
γx(s2 − s1) by Lemma 3.1, we have dist(b−1(s1), b−1(s2)) ≤ s2 − s1. Combining this with
Lemma 3.3, we obtain
Corollary 3.4. Suppose s1 < s2 and b−1(s1) 6= ∅, then dist(b−1(s1), b−1(s2)) = s2 − s1.
Corollary 3.5. Suppose s1 < s2, b−1(s1) 6= ∅ and diam(b−1(s2)) ≤ T , then diam(b−1(s1)) ≤
T + 2(s2 − s1) and diam(Ω[s1,s2]) ≤ T + 2(s2 − s1).

The main result of this section is that we have a monotonic property on the area of level
sets of a Busemann function, see Proposition 3.21 and Corollary 3.22. The tool we use is
the general results established in [9]. Recall that given a 1-Lipschitz function ϕ : X → R,

12

XIAN-TAO HUANG

we can associate to it a set of couples moved by ϕ and deﬁne an equivalence relation on
the so-called transport set, such that each equivalence class is a geodesic ray, then one can
establish a disintegration formula with respect to this relation, see [9]. Since Busemann
functions are very special 1-Lipschitz functions, we can apply the general results in [9].
The non-branching assumption will give some additional properties on the transport set.
In the following we will present how the notions and results in [9] can be applied in our
setting, and obtain some special properties on the transport set of Busemann function.

Deﬁnition 3.6. The set of couples moved by b is deﬁned to be:

(3.1)

Γ := {(x, y) ∈ X × X | b(y) − b(x) = d(x, y)}.

Lemma 3.7. Suppose (x, y), (y, z) ∈ Γ, then (x, z) ∈ Γ and d(x, z) = d(x, y) + d(y, z).
Proof. Because d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, z) = b(z) − b(x) ≤ d(x, z).
Lemma 3.8. Let (x, y) ∈ X × X be an element of Γ. Let σ ∈ Geo(X) be such that σ0 = x
and σ1 = y. Then (σs, σt) ∈ Γ for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 1.
Proof. For 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 1, we have

(cid:3)

d(σs, σt) ≥b(σt) − b(σs) = (b(σ1) − b(σ0)) + (b(σt) − b(σ1)) + (b(σ0) − b(σs))

≥d(σ0, σ1) − d(σt, σ1) − d(σ0, σs) = d(σs, σt),

the claim follows.

(cid:3)

s , γx

t ) ∈ Γ for any s ≤ t. By the non-branching assumption, we further have:

It is natural then to consider the set of geodesics G := {σ ∈ Geo(X) | (σ0, σ1) ∈ Γ}.
On the other hand, for any x and a Busemann ray γx : [0,∞) → X, by Lemma 3.1 we
have (γx
Lemma 3.9. Suppose σ ∈ G satisﬁes σ0 = x and σ1 = y, then σ is contained in a geodesic
ray ¯γ : [0,∞) → X, with ¯γ(0) = x and (¯γs, ¯γt) ∈ Γ for every t ≥ s ≥ 0.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume σ has unit length. Denote by z = σ 1
γz : [0,∞) → X a Busemann ray. By Lemmas 3.1, 3.7 and 3.8, we know σ |[0, 1
γz |[0, 1
obtain that σ |[ 1
¯γ : [0,∞) → X such that b(¯γt) − b(¯γs) = d(¯γs, ¯γt) for any t ≥ s ≥ 0.
Deﬁnition 3.10. We deﬁne the set of transport rays by

, and
2 ] and
2 ] glue to be a geodesic. Combining this with the non-branching assumption, we
2 ] and γz form a longer geodesic ray

2 ,1] and γz |[0, 1

2 ] coincide, while σ |[0, 1

(cid:3)

R = Γ ∪ Γ−1,

where Γ−1 := {(x, y) ∈ X × X | (y, x) ∈ Γ}. For ﬁxed x, we use Γ(x) to denote {y ∈ X |
(x, y) ∈ Γ}, Γ−1(x) to denote {y ∈ X | (y, x) ∈ Γ}. Let R(x) = Γ(x) ∪ Γ−1(x).
Deﬁnition 3.11. The set of initial points is deﬁned to be

a+ := {z ∈ X | ∄x ∈ X such that (x, z) ∈ Γ, d(x, z) > 0}.

Deﬁne the transport set to be T := X \ a+.
Remark 3.12. Since b is 1-Lipschitz, Γ, Γ−1 and R are all closed. Moreover Γ, Γ−1 and
R are all σ-compact because X is proper. Since

T = P2(Γ ∩ {(x, z) ∈ X × X | d(x, z) > 0}),

T is analytic.

13

Remark 3.13. Similar deﬁnitions are given in [9] and [13]. In general, corresponding to
a set of transport ray Γ, we can deﬁne the set of ﬁnal points a− and the transport set with
end points Te to be

a− := {z ∈ X | ∄x ∈ X such that (z, x) ∈ Γ, d(x, z) > 0},

Te = P1(Γ \ {x = y}) ∪ P1(Γ−1 \ {x = y}),

where {x = y} stands for {(x, y) ∈ X × X | d(x, y) = 0}.
However, in the setting we discuss in this paper, a− = ∅, while Te = X, so we don’t
give these deﬁnitions in Deﬁnition 3.10. a− = ∅ and Te = X can be easily derived from
the non-branching assumption and the fact that for any point x there is an associated
Busemann ray γx with (x, γx(1)) ∈ Γ.

Under the non-branching assumption and MCP(K, N ) condition, we can prove a+ is
m-negligible. This is done in Step 1 of the proof of Theorem 9.5 in [9]. We give a sketch
on the idea of its proof here for completeness. Suppose on the contrary, m(a+) > 0,
then by inner regularity of compact sets, we ﬁnd a compact set A ⊂ a+ with m(A) > 0.
Denote by c = maxx∈A{b(x)}. By a selection principle of Von Neumann (see Theorem
5.5.2 in [37]), we can ﬁnd a m-measurable map ˜f : A → T such that (x, ˜f (x)) ∈ Γ and
b( ˜f (x)) = c + 1. Up to choosing a smaller A, we can assume ˜f is continuous on A. Denote
by µ = 1
: [0, 1] → X be the geodesic such that
η(x)
0 = x, η(x)
1 = ˜f (x). Denote by At := {et(η(x)) | x ∈ A}. By the the non-branching
assumption and A ⊂ a+, it is easy to prove At ∩ As = ∅ provided s 6= t. Since all the At’s
are contained in a bounded set K ⊂ X, we have Pt∈[0,1] m(At) ≤ m(K) < ∞. On the
other hand, combining the MCP(K, N ) assumption, we can prove the estimate

m(A) m|A, ν = ˜f∗µ. For any x ∈ A, let η(x)

t

(3.2)

m(At) ≥ (1 − t)m(A) min

x∈A(cid:26) sK((1 − t)d(x, ˜f (x))/√N − 1)
sK(d(x, ˜f (x))/√N − 1)
which implies Pt∈[0,1] m(At) = ∞, and we get a contradiction.
(3.2) is obtained by
approximating ν by Dirac deltas. Let {yi}i∈N be a dense sequence in supp(ν). For i, I ∈ N
with i ≤ I, deﬁne the family of sets

∀t ∈ [0, 1],

(cid:27)N −1

,

Ei,I := {x ∈ A | d(x, yi) ≤ d(x, yj),∀j ≤ I}.

Let Ξi,I := Ξyi,Ei,I be the dynamical transference plan in Deﬁnition 2.7, in particular Ξi,I

satisﬁes (2.9). Because Si≤I supp((e1−t)∗Ξi,I) converges in Hausdorﬀ distance to At as
I → ∞, we obtain (3.2) from (2.9). See Section 9 in [9] for more details.
We are easy to see R is an equivalent relation on T by deﬁnition, and for all x ∈ T ,
R(x) forms a single geodesic ray (see Lemma 3.9). In addition, for distinct x, y ∈ T , either
R(x) = R(y), or R(x) ∩ R(y) = ∅, or R(x) ∩ R(y) ⊂ a+.
Since each equivalence class of R on T is a single geodesic ray, making use of the
continuity and local compactness of geodesics as well as a special form of selection principle
(see Corollary 2.7 in [9]), one can prove the following:
Proposition 3.14 (Proposition 4.4 in [9]). There exists an m-measurable section f : T →
T for the equivalence relation R. More precisely, there exists a saturated set Z ⊂ T such
that Z is A(X)-measurable, T \ Z is m-negligible, and the section f restricted on Z is
A(X)-measurable.

Here we recall that a set A ⊂ X is called to be saturated for the equivalence relation
E ⊂ X × X if A = ∪x∈AE(x). A map f : X → X is called a section of an equivalence

14

XIAN-TAO HUANG

relation E if for any x, y ∈ X it holds

(x, f (x)) ∈ E,

and

(x, y) ∈ E ⇒ f (x) = f (y).

A cross-section of the equivalence relation E is a set S ⊂ E such that the intersection of
S with each equivalence class is a singleton.

The set

D := f (T ) = {x ∈ T | d(x, f (x)) = 0},

is obviously a cross-section. D inherit the subspace topology from T .
In particular,
(D,B(D)) is countably separated. By Lusin’s theorem, we derive that there exists a σ-
compact set S ⊂ D such that m(T \ f −1(S)) = 0. Furthermore, f restricted on f −1(S)
is Borel. The argument is as follows. Let C ⊂ X be any Borel set, then f −1(S ∩ C) =
R−1(S ∩ C) ∩ T and f −1(S \ C) = R−1(S \ C) ∩ T are disjoint analytic sets. By the ﬁrst
separation theorem for analytic sets (see Theorem 4.4.1 in [37]) there is a Borel set B ⊂ X
such that f −1(S ∩ C) ⊂ B and f −1(S \ C) ∩ B = ∅. Thus f −1(S ∩ C) = B ∩ f −1(S), i.e.
f is Borel on f −1(S).
Since m is σ-ﬁnite, we ﬁx a partition {Γn}n≥1 of X into Borel sets of ﬁnite measure.
Let {λn}n≥1 be a sequence of positive real numbers such that Pn≥1 λnµ(Γn) = 1, and

take

(3.3)

˜m(B) = Xn≥1

λnm(Γn ∩ B)

for B ∈ B(X). Clearly, ˜m is a probability measure, m and ˜m are absolutely continuous
with respect to each other. In particular, m(B) = 0 ⇔ ˜m(B) = 0 for B ∈ B(X). Now
the push forward measure ˜ν = f∗ ˜m is well deﬁned. Obviously, ˜ν concentrates on D, and
˜ν(D \ S) = 0.
disintegration y 7→ ˜ρy of ˜m over ˜ν strongly consistent with f , i.e.

We apply Theorem 2.15 to (f −1(S),B(f −1(S)), ˜m) and (S,B(S), ˜ν) and obtain a unique

(3.4)

˜m(B ∩ f −1(C)) = ZC

˜ρy(B)˜ν(dy)

holds for every B ∈ B(f −1(S)), C ∈ B(S).
We deﬁne ρ : B(f −1(S)) × S → [0,∞] by
ρy(B) = Xn≥1

λ−1
n ˜ρy(Γn ∩ B)

for every B ∈ B(f −1(S)) and y ∈ S, then we have

m(B ∩ f −1(C)) = Xn≥1
= Xn≥1
= ZC

ρy(B)˜ν(dy).

λ−1
n ˜m(Γn ∩ B ∩ f −1(C))
n ZC

˜ρy(Γn ∩ B)˜ν(dy)

λ−1

Thus y 7→ ρy is a disintegration of m over ˜ν consistent with f . It is easy to check y 7→ ρy
is the unique strongly consistent disintegration w.r.t. f over ˜ν.

Since ˜ν(D \ S) = m(T \ f −1(S)) = 0, for any B ⊂ T m-measurable and C ⊂ D

˜ν-measurable, it holds

(3.5)

m(B ∩ f −1(C)) = ZC

ρy(B)˜ν(dy),

and for ˜ν-a.e. y ∈ D, it holds
(3.6)

ρy(f −1(D \ {y})) = 0.

We deﬁne the ray map as follows:

Deﬁnition 3.15. Deﬁne the ray map g : Dom(g) ⊂ D × R → X by the formula

graph(g) :=(cid:8)(y, t, x) | y ∈ D, t ∈ R, x ∈ R(y), b(x) = t(cid:9)

Since R(y) is the single geodesic for y ∈ D, and the restriction of b on R(y) is a strictly
monotony function, the set in the above deﬁnition is clearly the graph of some map g.
From the deﬁnition of the ray map, we immediately obtain the following properties:

Proposition 3.16. The following properties hold:

(1) The ray map g restricted on Dom(g) ∩ S × R is Borel.
(2) The range of g is X.
(3) For every ﬁxed y ∈ D, the map t 7→ g(y, t) is 1-Lipschitz Γ-order preserving.
(4) (y, t) 7→ g(y, t) is bijective on T , and its inverse is
x 7→ g−1(x) = (f (x), b(x)),

where f is the quotient map deﬁned in Proposition 3.14.

We remark that in Section 4 of [9], there is a deﬁnition of ray map, and it has similar
properties as in Proposition 3.16. Our deﬁnition here is motivated by that in [9], we use
the ray map in the form of Deﬁnition 3.15 for convenience of later use.

It is easy to check Ft is Borel for any t ∈ R+, and for every t, s ∈ R+ and x ∈ T , it

holds

Ft+s(x) = Ft(Fs(x)),
d(Fs(x), Ft(x)) = |s − t|.

Theorem 3.18 (Theorem 5.7 in [9]). For ˜ν-a.e. y ∈ S, the conditional measures ρy
are absolutely continuous w.r.t. g(y,·)∗L1. More precisely, there is some function q(·,·) :
Dom(g) ∩ S × R → [0,∞) such that

m = g∗(q˜ν ⊗ L1)

and

(3.11)
for ˜ν-a.e. y ∈ S.

ρy = g(y,·)∗(q(y,·)L1)

Furthermore, under the assumption that (X, d, m) is a non-branching MCP(K, N )

space, we can obtain the following estimate for the function q:

Let K ⊂ b−1((−∞, r0]) be a compact set contained in f −1(S). By (3.5) and Theorem

We call X has minimal volume growth if (4.1) holds.

In this section, the metric measure space (X, d, m) is always assumed to be noncompact,

non-branching and satisfying the MCP(0, N ) condition and (4.1).

Proposition 4.1. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N ) space
and satisﬁes (4.1), then the level sets b−1(r) have ﬁnite ‘codimension 1’ volume m−1.
Furthermore, for any r2 > r1, we have
(4.2)
Proof. Let K ⊂ b−1((−∞, r1]) be any compact set, denote by ¯r = maxx∈Ξr1 (K) d(p, x),
then by Corollary 3.4, Ξ[r1,r2](K) ⊂ m(Bp(¯r + r2 − r1)), and then by (3.17)

m−1(b−1(r1)) ≤ m−1(b−1(r2)) ≤ V0.

m−1(Ξr1(K)) ≤ V0.

m−1(b−1(r1)) ≤ V0

holds for any r1. By (3.17) again, we have

(4.6)

m−1(b−1(r1)) ≤ m−1(b−1(r2))

for any r2 > r1 and complete the proof.

By (4.2), the limit

[36] to MCP(0, N ) spaces, and our argument follows that of [36].

The following theorem is the main result of this section. It generalizes Theorem 19 of

Theorem 4.2 (=Theorem 1.2). Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N )
space satisfying the minimal volume growth condition (4.1), and b is the Busemann func-
tion associated to a geodesic ray γ. Then the diameter of the level sets b−1(r) grow at
most linearly, i.e.,

(4.7)

lim sup
R→+∞

diam(b−1(R))

R

< ∞.

In particular, b−1(r) is compact.

Proof. By Proposition 4.1 and the deﬁnition of V∞, we can ﬁnd r0 and a compact set
K ⊂ b−1((−∞, r0]) such that
(4.8)

V∞ − Vr0

Vr0

≤

5N +1 ,

where

Vr0 := m−1(Ξr0(K)).

Take R = 3r + diam(Ξr0(K)) and ﬁxed an x ∈ Ξr0(K), we claim that there exists T > 0
such that

(4.9)

b−1(r + r0) ⊂ Bx(R)

for every r > T . It is easy to see the claim implies (4.7). Furthermore, by Corollary 3.5,
the diameter of b−1(s) is ﬁnite provided diam(b−1(t)) < ∞ for some t > s, thus for any r,
diam(b−1(r)) is ﬁnite and hence b−1(r) is a compact subset of X.
Suppose (4.9) does not hold, then there exist sequences of {ri} ⊂ R+, {qi} ⊂ X such that
ri → ∞, b(qi) = r0 + ri, d(x, qi) > 3ri + diam(Ξr0(K)). By Corollary 3.4, Ξ[r0,r0+2r](K) ⊂
Bx(R − r) holds for any r > 0, hence d(qi, Ξ[r0,r0+2ri](K)) > ri and thus d(qi, Ξ(K)) > ri
for every i.
By Lemma 3.2, b−1([r0 + r,∞)) is connected, thus for every i there exists a curve

σi : [0, 1] → b−1([r0 + ri,∞)) such that σi(0) = qi and σi(1) ∈ Ξr0+ri(K). Since

d(σi(0), Ξ(K)) − b(σi(0)) + r0 > 0,

and

d(σi(1), Ξ(K)) − b(σi(1)) + r0 ≤ −ri < 0,

there exists pi = σi(ti) with ti ∈ (0, 1) such that d(pi, Ξ(K)) = b(pi) − r0. Denote by
hi = b(pi) − r0. Obviously hi → ∞.
Note that we have Bpi(hi) ∩ Ξ(K) = ∅. On the other hand, since pi ∈ b−1(r0 + hi), we
have Bpi(hi) ⊂ b−1([r0, r0 + 2hi]). Therefore,
(4.10)

m(Bpi(hi)) ≤ m(b−1([r0, r0 + 2hi])) − m(Ξ[r0,r0+2hi](K)).

By Corollary 3.22 and Proposition 4.1, this implies

(4.11)

m(Bpi(hi)) ≤ 2hi(V∞ − Vr0).

NONCOMPACT RCD(0, N ) SPACES WITH LINEAR VOLUME GROWTH

19

Denote by ¯r = inf y∈K b(y). Take ¯Ri = 5hi + diam(K) + 2(r0 − ¯r), then it is easy to
check Ξ[r0,r0+2hi](K) ⊂ Bpi( ¯Ri). Since the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison estimate
(2.10) holds on X, we have

(4.12)

m(Bpi(hi)) ≥ (cid:18) hi

m(Bpi( ¯Ri)) ≥ (cid:18) hi

5. RCD(0, N ) with strongly minimal volume growth

5.1. Strongly minimal volume growth.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N ) space, b
is the Busemann function associated to a geodesic ray γ. We say (X, d, m) has strongly
minimal volume growth if

(5.1)

lim
R→∞

m(Bp(R))

R

= m−1(Ξr0(K)),

holds for some r0 ∈ R and a compact set K ⊂ b−1((−∞, r0]). (See Section 3 for the
deﬁnition of Ξr0(K).)

Proposition 5.2. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N ) space
and satisﬁes (5.1), then

(1) b−1((r0,∞)) ⊂ Ξ(K),
(2) m−1(Ξr(K)) = m−1(Ξr0(K)) for any r ≥ r0.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). Suppose on the contrary (1) does not hold, there is some
z ∈ b−1((r0,∞)) \ Ξ(K). Since Ξ(K) is a closed set and b−1((r0,∞)) is open, there is a
small δ > 0 such that Bz(δ) ⊂ b−1((r0,∞))\Ξ(K). Denote by t = miny∈K{b(y)} and r1 =
b(z)+δ. For any r2 > r1+1, take R = max{d(z, p)+r2−b(z)+δ, d(p, K)+diam(K)+r2−t}.
It is easy to see Bz(δ) ⊂ b−1((−∞, r1]) and Ξ[r1,r2](Bz(δ)) ∪ Ξ[r1,r2](K) ⊂ Bp(R).

By Proposition 3.21 and Corollary 3.22, we have

(5.2)

and

m(Ξ[r1,r2](Bz(δ))) ≥(r2 − r1)m(Ξ[r1,r1+1](Bz(δ))) > 0,

m(Ξ[r1,r2](K)) ≥ (r2 − r1)m−1(Ξr1(K)) ≥ (r2 − r1)m−1(Ξr0(K)).

(5.3)
On the other hand, by the non-branching assumption, it is easy to see Ξ(Bz(δ))∩ Ξ(K) ⊂
a+, which is m-negligible. Therefore,

Let r2 → ∞, we obtain

lim
R→∞

m(Bx0(R))

R

> m−1(Ξr0(K)),

contradicting to (5.1). This proves (1).

Now we prove (2). Suppose on the contrary there is some r1 > r0 such that m−1(Ξr1(K)) >

m−1(Ξr0(K)). For any r2 > r1, take R = d(p, K) + diam(K) + r2 − t, where t =
miny∈K{b(y)}, then we have Ξ[r1,r2](K) ⊂ Bp(R).

By Corollary 3.22, we have

m(Bp(R))

R

≥

m(Ξ[r1,r2](K))

m−1(Ξr1(K)).

Let r2 → ∞, we obtain

lim
R→∞

m(Bp(R))

R

≥ m−1(Ξr1(K)) > m−1(Ξr0(K)),

contradicting to (5.1). The proof is completed.

(cid:3)

An easy corollary of (1) of Proposition 5.2 is

(5.5)

X = Ξ(K).

This is because for any x ∈ X, there is some z ∈ b−1((r0,∞)) such that x ∈ R(z), hence
by Proposition 5.2, x ∈ R(z′) for some z′ ∈ K.
This also shows that for any r′ > r0, b−1(r′) can be taken as a cross-section. We will
ﬁx such a D = b−1(r′). Then the map f in Proposition 3.14 can be easily deﬁned: for
any x ∈ T , f (x) = x′ ∈ D if x ∈ R(x′). The set S can be taken as D. By Theorem
4.2, D is compact. Now we obtain a disintegration of m over ˜ν strongly consistent with
f as in (3.5) and (3.6). We remark that the S, D, f and ˜ν we redeﬁne here may not the
same as those we deﬁne at Section 3. In the remainder of this section, these notations will
always mean the redeﬁned ones. All the properties in Section 3 hold for these redeﬁned
objectives, especially Corollary 3.20 holds.

By Corollary 3.20 and (2) in Proposition 5.2, we obtain

q(y, r) = q(y, r0)

holds for ˜ν-a.e. y ∈ D and r ≥ r0. If we take dν′(y) = q(y, r0)d˜ν(y), and endow a measure
µ := ν′ ⊗ L1 on D × (r0,∞), then by (3.10) in Theorem 3.18, we have g∗µ = m.
Recall the ﬂow Ft in Deﬁnition 3.17. It’s easy to see that for t ≥ 0, Ft : b−1((r0,∞)) →
b−1((r0 + t,∞)) is a bijection, whose inverse is denoted by F−t := F −1
, a map from
b−1((r0 + t,∞)) to b−1((r0,∞)).

Suppose t ≥ 0, let ϕ ≥ 0 be an arbitrary Borel function with supp(ϕ) ⊂ b−1((0,∞)),

ϕdm,

thus Ft : (b−1((r0,∞)), m) → (b−1((r0 + t,∞)), m) is measure-preserving. Similarly, F−t
is also measure-preserving on b−1((r0 + t,∞)).

In conclusion, we have the following proposition:

Proposition 5.3. Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching MCP(0, N ) space
and satisﬁes (5.1), then the ray map g is measure-preserving when viewed as a map from
(D × (r0,∞), µ) to (b−1((r0,∞)), m), i.e.
(5.6)
For any t ≥ 0, the ﬂow Ft : (b−1((r0,∞)), m) → (b−1((r0 + t,∞)), m) is bijective and
measure-preserving; for t < 0, the ﬂow Ft : (b−1((r0 − t,∞)), m) → (b−1((r0,∞)), m) is
measure-preserving.

g∗µ = m.

An interesting question is that whether we can obtain more information at the part
b−1((r0,∞)). For example, if there is a metric splitting theorem on b−1((r0,∞))? This
can be done if we assume (X, d, m) is in addition an RCD(0, N ) space.

Theorem 5.4 (=Theorem 1.3). Suppose (X, d, m) is a noncompact, non-branching RCD(0, N )
space and satisﬁes (5.1), then (X, d, m) has only one end and there is some metric measure
space (X ′, d′, ν′) such that the one of the following holds:

c = m(b−1([r0, r0 + 1]));

(1) if X ′ has exactly one point, then (X, d, m) is isomorphic to ([0,∞), dEcul, cL1) with
(2) if X ′ has more than one point, then N ≥ 2, and (X ′, d′, m′) is a compact connected
RCD(0, N−1) space, and (b−1((r0,∞)), d) is locally isometric to (X ′×(r0,∞), d′×
dEcul). Furthermore, let r1 = r0 + diam(X ′)
, then (b−1((r1,∞)), d, m) is isomorphic
to (X ′ × (r1,∞), d′ × dEcul, ν′ ⊗ L1).

2

In the remaining part of this paper, we will prove Theorem 5.4. From now on, the
metric measure space (X, d, m) is always assumed to be noncompact, non-branching and
satisfying the RCD(0, N ) condition as well as (5.1). We assume r0 = 0 in (5.1) for
convenient. And we will put S = D = b−1(r′) for some ﬁxed r′ > 0 as in the paragraphs
before Proposition 5.3.
We ﬁrst prove that under the assumption of Theorem 5.4, (X, d, m) has exactly one
end. We claim that the Busemann function b obtain a global minimum on X. If the claim
holds, then by Corollary 3.5 we are easy to see b is a proper function on X, and then by
Lemma 3.2 (X, d, m) has only one end. Suppose on the contrary the claim does not hold,
then there is a sequence of points {xi} ⊂ X such that b(xi) = −i. From each xi, there is

22

XIAN-TAO HUANG

a geodesic ray ηi : [−i,∞) → X such that ηi(−i) = xi, and (xi, ηi(t)) ∈ Γ, ∀t ≥ −i. From
(5.5), we have ηi(r′) ∈ D. Recall that D is a compact set. Hence up to a subsequence, ηi
converge to a line η : (−∞,∞) → X with η(r′) ∈ D. Now by Gigli’s splitting theorem on
RCD(0, N ) (see Theorem 1.1), (X, d, m) is isomorphic to the product of (R, dEucl,L1) and
some (X ′, d′, m′), where (X ′, d′, m′) is either a point (when N ∈ [1, 2)) or a RCD(0, N − 1)
space (when N ≥ 2). In the case of N ≥ 2, since (X ′, d′, m′) is also an MCP(0, N − 1)
space, if it is noncompact, then it will have inﬁnite volume, thus (X, d, m) cannot have
linear volume growth and we get a contradiction. Hence X ′ must be a compact space.
It is easy to see the Busemann function ˜b associated to η must be coincide with b up to
adding a constant, and

(5.7)

lim
R→∞

m(Bp(R))

R

= 2m−1(Ξ0(K)),

which contradicts (5.1). Thus the claim holds.

The remaining arguments in Theorem 5.4 is to prove a ‘volume cone implies metric

cone’-type property on (X, d, m). We follow the strategy in [26].

5.2. Basic properties of b. In this subsection, we obtain some basic properties of b.

From the argument at the end of last subsection, we have obtained

Lemma 5.5. b is a proper function on X.

By Lemma 3.1, it is easy to see lip(b) ≡ 1 on X. Since volume doubling property and
a weak local (1, 1)-Poincar´e inequality hold on the RCD(0, N ) space (X, d, m) (see [31]
[34]), we have

Lemma 5.6. |Db(x)| = lip(b)(x) = 1 m-a.e..

We recall the follow proposition, which is a consequence of the Laplacian comparison

estimates for the distance function ([22]).

Proposition 5.7 (Proposition 5.19 in [22]). Let (X, d, m) be an RCD(0, N ) space. Let
γ be a geodesic ray and b the Busemann function associated to it. Then b ∈ D(∆) and
∆b ≥ 0.

Combining Propositions 5.3, 5.7 and Lemma 5.6, we can prove the following:

Proposition 5.8. ∆b = 0 on b−1((0,∞)).
Proof. Let ϕ : R+ → [0, 1] be a Lipschitz function with supp(ϕ) ⊂⊂ (0,∞). Thus

ϕ′(s)ds(cid:19)ν′(dy)
ϕ′(b(x))dm

ϕ′(b(x))|Db(x)|2dm

ϕ(b(x))d∆b ≤ 0.

Hence Rb−1((0,∞)) ϕ(b(x))d∆b = 0. By ∆b ≥ 0 and the arbitrariness of ϕ, we obtain
∆b = 0 on b−1((0,∞)).

Proposition 5.9. ˜b ∈ Test(X) and ∆˜b ∈ W 1,2(X) ∩ L∞(X).
Proof. Evidently ˜b is Lipschitz with supp(˜b) ⊂ b−1([ ˜r
2 , 2 ˜R]). Recall the facts that |Db|2 = 1
m-a.e. and ∆b = 0 on b−1((0,∞)), then by the chain rule for the distributional Laplacian
(see Proposition 4.11 in [22]), we have

∆˜b = ˜ϕ′′ ◦ b|Db|2m + ˜ϕ′ ◦ b∆b = ˜ϕ′′ ◦ bm.

Obviously ˜ϕ′′ ◦ b ∈ W 1,2(X) ∩ L∞(X), hence ˜b ∈ D(∆) with ∆˜b ∈ W 1,2(X) ∩ L∞(X). (cid:3)

By (2.19) and polarization, we obtain Hess(b) = 0 m-a.e. on b−1((0,∞)).
5.3. Eﬀect of Ft on the Dirichlet energy and metric. As is mentioned above, we
only know information on b−1((0,∞)), so we need some cut-oﬀ argument. Let ¯r be a ﬁxed
positive number. Let ¯ϕ ∈ C ∞(R) be a smooth increasing function satisfying ¯ϕ ≡ 0 on
(−∞, ¯r

2 ], ¯ϕ(x) = x on [¯r,∞). Deﬁne ¯b : X → R to be
¯b(x) = ¯ϕ ◦ b(x).

Note that ¯b is Lipschitz, with support in [ ¯r
2 ,∞) and equal to b on [¯r,∞). We deﬁne
the reparametrization function rep : R+ × R → R+, rept(r) = rep(t, r) by requiring it
satisfying rep0(r) = 0 and

(5.12)

for every t ≥ 0. It’s easy to see rept(r) = 0 for (t, r) ∈ R+ × (−∞, ¯r
(t, r) ∈ R+ × [¯r,∞). We then deﬁne the ﬂow ¯F : R+ × X → X to be

¯Ft(x) = Frept(b(x))(x).

Lemma 5.12. The following properties hold:
(i): ¯Ft is the identity on b−1((−∞, ¯r

c(t) ≤ ∂rf −1

(r) ≤ C(t).

Denote by ht(r) := ∂rrept(r) = ∂rft(r). Diﬀerentiate (5.12) in r to deduce that ht(r)

solves the equation

∂tht(r) = ¯ϕ′′(r + rept(r))(1 + ht(r))

(5.16)
with the initial condition h0(r) = 0. Note that the function identically −1 is a solution
of (5.16), also note that ϕ′′ has compact support, by comparison principle we are easy to
derive

ht(r) ≥ −1 + ˜c(t),

∀r ≥ 0,

for a function ˜c(t) > 0. On the other hand, since rept(r) = r for r ≥ ¯r, we know ht(r) = 1
for all r ≥ ¯r. Also note that ht(0) = 0. Then by the smoothness of ht(r), we have
ht(r) ≤ ˜C(t) for any r ∈ R+. Hence

The properties in Lemma 5.12 are similar to the properties a)- f) in Proposition 3.9 of
[26]. Using these properties we can establish the following lemma, which is very similar
to Lemma 3.11 in [26]. We provide a proof here for completeness.
Lemma 5.13. If f ∈ Lp(X), p < ∞, then t 7→ f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ Lp(X) is continuous.
If f ∈ W 1,2(X), then t 7→ f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ L2(X) is C 1 and its derivative is given by

(5.17)

f ◦ ¯Ft = h∇f,∇¯bi ◦ ¯Ft.

Proof. Let g be a Lipschitz function with bounded support K := supp(g), for t1 suﬃciently
close to t0, we have

On the other hand, for any f, g ∈ Lp(X), by property (5.14), we have

where C(t) is some continuous function. Since Lipschitz functions with bounded support
are dense in Lp(X), we are easy to derive the continuity of the map t 7→ f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ Lp(X)
for general f ∈ Lp(X) from (5.18) and (5.19).
Suppose ¯m ∈ P(X) satisﬁes m ≪ ¯m ≤ Cm for some C > 0. Given any t0 < t1, let
T : X → C([0, 1], X) be the map sending x to the curve [0, 1] ∋ s 7→ η(x)
:= ¯Fst1+(1−s)t0 (x)
and deﬁne π := T∗ ¯m. Property (5.14) ensures that π satisﬁes (1) in Deﬁnition 2.1. By
(iv) in Lemma 5.12, | ˙η(x)
| ≤ (t1 − t0)Lip(¯b) for every s, thus π satisﬁes (2) in Deﬁnition
2.1. Hence π is a test plan. From the deﬁnition of minimal weak upper gradient, for π-a.e.
η we have

|f (η1) − f (η0)| ≤ Z 1

Hence for m-a.e. x we have

0 |Df|2( ¯Ft)dtdm
0 Z |Df|2d( ¯Ft)∗mdt

where we use (5.14) in the last inequality, and the upper bound C is depending only on
t0 provided t1 is suﬃciently close to t0. This shows that t 7→ f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ L2(X) is Lipschitz
at t0 and because ¯Ft, t ∈ R, form a group , it is clear that local Lipschitz continuity holds
on R.

In the next, we prove

f ◦ ¯Ft − f ◦ ¯Fs

and argue as in the ﬁrst part, ˜π is a test plan. Moreover, from (iv) in Lemma 5.12, we

Note that (es)∗˜π ⇀ ρm weakly, which follows from the W 2-convergence. By (5.14),
(es)∗ ˜π ≤ Cm for some positive constant C. Thus (es)∗˜π ⇀ ρm as s ↓ 0 in duality with
L1(X). Divide (5.25) by t, and let t ↓ 0, since the measures (es)∗ ˜π have uniformly bounded
support and |D¯b| is bounded on bounded sets, we know ˜π represents the gradient of ¯b (see
Deﬁnition 2.4). Hence (5.24) follows from Theorem 2.5.
Since t 7→ f◦ ¯Ft ∈ L2(X) is Lipschitz and the Radon-Nikodym property holds on L2(X),
this curve is L1-a.e. diﬀerentiable, where the diﬀerential is given by (5.23). Note that the
curve t 7→ h∇f,∇¯bi ◦ ¯Fs is continuous in L2(X), the curve t 7→ f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ L2(X) is C 1 and
we complete the proof.

argument for f ∈ S2

t

→ h∇f,∇bi weakly in L2(b−1((0,∞))) as t ↓ 0.

Our next goal is to study the eﬀect of ¯Ft on the Dirichlet energy E, see Theorem 5.16.
The main tool is the heat ﬂow, which is the L2-gradient ﬂow of E. A problem arises in
the proof of Theorem 5.16 is that the support of hs(f ) will not stay in b−1((¯r,∞)) even if
the support of f does. Thus we need suitable cut-oﬀ functions and controlling the error
terms. Our argument follows [26] closely.

Firstly we recall the following lemma from [26]:

Lemma 5.14 (Lemma 3.14 in [26]). Suppose (X, d, m) is an RCD(0, N ) space. For every
r > 0 there is a constant C(r) > 0 such that the following holds. Given K ⊂ U with K
compact and U open such that inf x∈K,y∈U c d(x, y) ≥ r. If f ∈ L2(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ K,
then for every t > 0 the quantities

(5.27)

are all bounded from above by C(r)t2 k f k2
L2 .

Z t
0 ZU c |Dhs(f )|2dmds,

Applying Lemma 5.14, we can prove the following estimate.

Proposition 5.15. Given any r > 0 there is a constant C(r) such that for any f ∈ L2(X)
with supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((¯r + r,∞)) and any s ∈ (0, 1) we have
(5.28)

≤ s2C(r) k f k2

L2 .

Proof. By (2.17), it is easy to check that the term R h∇h2s(f ),∇¯bif dm vary continuously
as f varies in L2(X). Hence by Lemma 2.13 and a simple density argument we only need
to prove the conclusion of the proposition holds for f ∈ Test(X) with support contained
in a compact set K with K ⊂ b−1((¯r + r, R)). Denote by U = b−1((¯r + r
2 , 2R)) and note
that inf x∈K,y∈U c d(x, y) ≥ r

It is easy to see that the function t 7→ R h∇hs+t(f ),∇¯bihs−t(f )dm is C 1 on [0, s], thus

that the ﬁrst integral in the third equality vanishes, and use Lemma 5.14 in the last
inequality.

Combining (5.29) (5.30) and (5.31) we obtain the estimate (5.28).

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.16. Suppose f ∈ L2(X) satisﬁes supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((¯r + T,∞)) for some T ≥ 0.
Then

E(f ◦ ¯Ft) = E(f ),

∀t ≤ T.
(5.32)
In particular, f ∈ W 1,2(X) if and only if f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ W 1,2(X).
Proof. Let ft := f ◦ ¯Ft and notice that supp(ft) ⊂ b−1((¯r + T − t,∞)) ⊂ b−1((¯r,∞)) for
every t ≤ T . By Proposition 5.3 we have R |ft|2dm = R |f|2dm and hence d

for any t ≤ T .

for t ≤ T . Hence we obtain (5.32).
Suppose f /∈ W 1,2(X), i.e. E(f ) = +∞. Then it is impossible that ft ∈ W 1,2(X)
for any t ≤ T . Otherwise change the role of f and ft in the above argument, we have
E(f ) ≤ E(ft) + C|t| k f k2
L2< ∞, which is a contradiction. Thus we have complete the
proof.

Theorem 5.16 can be ‘localized’ as follows:

Corollary 5.17. Suppose f ∈ L2(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((T,∞)) with T ≥ 0, then
f ∈ W 1,2(X) if and only if f ◦ Ft ∈ W 1,2(X) for any t ≤ T and in this case

Proof. Choose ¯r > 0 such that supp(f ) ⊂ b−1([¯r + T,∞)) and then build a corresponding
function ¯b and its gradient ﬂow ¯Ft as we have done in this subsection. Obviously, f ◦ ¯Ft =
f ◦ Ft m-a.e., and by the locality property of minimal weak upper gradient, we have
|D(f ◦ ¯Ft)| = |D(f ◦ Ft)| m-a.e.. By Theorem 5.16 we deduce that f ∈ W 1,2(X) if and
only if f ◦ ¯Ft ∈ W 1,2(X). Thus to conclude we only need to prove |D(f ◦ ¯Ft)| = |Df| ◦ ¯Ft
m-a.e. for f ∈ W 1,2(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((T,∞)).
By polarizing (5.32), for f1, f2 ∈ W 1,2(X) with supp(f1), supp(f2) ⊂ b−1((T,∞)), we
have

(5.39)

Z h∇(f1 ◦ ¯Ft),∇(f2 ◦ ¯Ft)idm = Z h∇f1,∇f2idm.

Now suppose f ∈ W 1,2(X) ∩ L∞(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((T,∞)). Let g ∈ W 1,2(X) ∩
Lip(X) with supp(g) ⊂⊂ b−1((T,∞)), and denote by ˜f = f ◦ ¯Ft, ˜g = g ◦ ¯Ft. Note that
f 2, gf ∈ W 1,2(X), then using the Leibniz rule and chain rule for minimal weak upper
gradient and (5.39), we have

Z |D ˜f|2˜gdm =Z h∇ ˜f ,∇( ˜f ˜g)idm −Z h∇(cid:0)

By the density of W 1,2(X) ∩ L∞(X) in W 1,2(X) and the arbitrariness of g, we complete
the proof.

The notion of Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property is a key to deduce metric information from

the study of Sobolev functions. See Proposition 4.20 in [24].

In Corollary 5.17, (5.38) holds only for f ∈ W 1,2(X) with supp(f ) ⊂ b−1((T,∞)), we
obtain that Ft’s are local isometry instead of isometry, see Theorem 5.18. The arguments
here follows that of Theorem 3.18 in [26].
Theorem 5.18. If we deﬁne the map F : R+ × b−1((0,∞)) → b−1((0,∞)) to be F (t, x) =
Ft(x), then F is a locally Lipschitz map with the following holds:
(1) for every t ∈ R+, Ft is an invertible locally isometry from b−1((0,∞)) to b−1((t,∞));
(2) for every t, s ∈ R+ and x ∈ b−1((0,∞)), we have

g(x) := min{d(y0, x), max{4r − d(y0, x), 0}},

then obviously g(x) ∈ Θ. For any y1 ∈ By0(2r), we have

d(y0, y1) = g(y1) ≤ sup

f ∈Λ |f (y1) − f (y0)| ≤ d(y0, y1).

(5.40)

(5.41)

Ft+s(x) = Ft(Fs(x)),
d(Fs(x), Ft(x)) = |s − t|;

(3) for any curve η : [0, 1] ∋ s 7→ b−1((0,∞)), putting ˜η := Ft ◦ η then η is absolutely

continuous if and only if ˜η is and in this case | ˙˜ηs| = | ˙ηs| for a.e. s ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Fix t ∈ R+. For any x0 ∈ b−1((t,∞)), choose r > 0 such that Bx0(5r) ⊂
b−1((t,∞)). Consider the set Θ consist of 1-Lipschitz functions with support in Bx0(5r),
endow Θ the topology induced by uniform convergence of functions. Let Λ be a countable
dense subset of Θ. For any y0 ∈ Bx0(r), consider the function

32

Hence

XIAN-TAO HUANG

d(y0, y1) = sup

f ∈Λ|f (y1) − f (y0)|,

∀y0, y1 ∈ Bx0(r).

Apply Corollary 5.17 to any f ∈ Λ, we obtain f ◦ Ft ∈ W 1,2(X) with |D(f ◦ Ft)| =
|Df| ◦ Ft ≤ 1 m-a.e.. Because X has the Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property, f ◦ Ft has a
1-Lipschitz representative for any f ∈ Λ. Since Λ is countable, there exists a m-negligible
Borel set N such that the restriction of f ◦ Ft to X \ N is 1-Lipschitz for every f ∈ Λ.
Hence for any x1, x2 ∈ F −1

(Bx0(r)) \ N , we have

t

d(Ft(x1), Ft(x2)) = sup

f ∈Λ|f (Ft(x1)) − f (Ft(x2))| ≤ d(x1, x2).

Since b−1((t,∞)) is σ-compact, we can ﬁnd a countable sequence of points {xi}i, radius
{ri}i, m-negligible Borel sets {Ni}i such that Bxi(ri) ⊂ b−1((t,∞)), {Bxi(ri)}i covers
b−1((t,∞)), Ft is 1-Lipschitz on F −1
(Bxi(ri)) \ Ni. Thus Ft is locally 1-Lipschitz on
b−1((0,∞)) \Si Ni. Denote by N ′ = Si Ni.
We deﬁne the map ˜Ft : b−1((0,∞)) → b−1((t,∞)) to be

t

˜Ft(x) = (cid:26) Ft(x),

limi Ft(yi),

if x ∈ b−1((0,∞)) \ N ′;
if x ∈ N ′ ∩ b−1((0,∞)),

where {yi} ⊂ b−1((0,∞)) \ N ′ is some sequence of points converging to x. Since Ft is
locally 1-Lipschitz, it is easy to check that ˜Ft is well-deﬁned and is also locally 1-Lipschitz.
Furthermore, by the continuity of b and (3.9), b( ˜Ft(x)) − b(x) = t and d( ˜Ft(x), x) = t for
any x ∈ b−1((0,∞)). This means ˜Ft coincides with Ft. Hence Ft is locally 1-Lipschitz on
b−1((0,∞)).
: b−1((t,∞)) → b−1((0,∞)). Hence Ft
is an invertible local isometry between b−1((0,∞)) and b−1((t,∞)). The above argument
holds for any t ∈ R+. Thus (1) is proved.
Combining with (3.9) and (1), we are easy to prove that the map F is locally Lipschitz.
Finally, (2) is just (3.8) and (3.9), and (3) follows from (1). The proof is completed. (cid:3)

The same argument above can be applied to F −1

5.4. Equipped D with the induced distance and measure. Now we consider the
cross section D = b−1(r′). From now on we denote by X ′ = D. Recall that X ′ is compact
by Theorem 4.2.

Suppose X ′ consists of exactly one point, i.e. X ′ = {x}, then obviously X = R(x), and
since b is a proper function on X, R(x) is a half-line, and it is easy to see (X, d, m) is
isomorphic to (R+, dEcul, cL1), where c = m(b−1([r′, r′ + 1])). In conclusion, we have
Lemma 5.19. If X ′ consists of exactly one point, then (X, d, m) is isomorphic to the half
line (R+, dEcul, cL1), where c = m(b−1([r′, r′ + 1])).

From now on, we will always assume X ′ contains at least 2 points.
We deﬁne the projection map Pj : b−1((0,∞)) → X ′ to be

Pj(x) = Fr′−b(x)(x).

By Theorem 5.18 the map Pj is well deﬁned and locally Lipschitz.

Suppose x, y ∈ X ′, by Lemma 3.2, there is a Lipschitz curve η : [0, 1] ∋ t 7→ ηt ∈
b−1([r′,∞)) with η(0) = x′, η(1) = y′. By Theorem 5.18, the curve σ = Pj(η) is a
Lipschitz curve connecting x′ and y′ in X ′. In conclusion, we have
Corollary 5.20. If X ′ consists of more than one point, then for every x′, y′ ∈ X ′ there
is a Lipschitz curve σ : [0, 1] → X ′ with σ0 = x′, σ1 = y′. In particular, X ′ is a connected
space with Hausdorﬀ dimension at least 1.

We deﬁne a new distance d′ on X ′:

d′(x′, y′)2 := inf

σ Z 1

0 | ˙σt|2dt

for x′, y′ ∈ X ′, where the inﬁmum is taken among all Lipschitz curves σ : [0, 1] → X ′ ⊂ X
and the metric speed is computed w.r.t. the distance d.
By Corollary 5.20, d′ is always ﬁnite and is a distance on X ′. Moreover, for any
Lipschitz curve σ : [0, 1] → X ′, it is easy to see d(σt, σs) ≤ d′(σt, σs) ≤ R t
s | ˙σr|dr for any
0 ≤ s < t ≤ 1. From this fact we deduce that a curve σ : [0, 1] → X ′ ⊂ X is absolutely
continuous w.r.t. d′ if and only if it is absolutely continuous w.r.t. d and in this case
the metric speeds computed w.r.t. the two distances are the same, so we still use | ˙σt| to
denote the metric speed if there is no ambiguity. It is easy to check the map Pj is still
locally Lipschitz even if X ′ equipped with the new distance d′.

The measure m′ on X ′ is chosen to be m′ := ν′.
Combining the facts that X is doubling, that Pj is locally Lipschitz, and Proposition
5.3, we can derive that (X ′, d′, m′) is also doubling, see Proposition 3.26 in [26] for similar
proof.

Denote by Y = X ′ × [0,∞), we endow Y with the product measure m′ ⊗ L1 and the

product distance d′ × dEucl deﬁned by

d′ × dEucl((x′, t), (y′, s)) := pd′(x′, y′)2 + |t − s|2.

We denote (Y, d′ × dEucl, m′ ⊗ L1) by (Y, dY , mY ) for simplicity.
similar notations are Y[c,d] e.t.c..

For 0 ≤ c < d ≤ ∞, we denote by Y(c,d) ⊂ Y to be Y(c,d) := X ′ × (c, d) for simplicity,
We introduce the maps T : Y → b−1((0,∞)) and S : b−1((0,∞)) → Y to be

T (x′, t) := Ft−r′(x′),
S(x) := (Pj(x), b(x)).

It’s easy to see that S ◦ T = Id|Y and T ◦ S = Id|b−1((0,∞)). From Proposition 5.3, it is

clear that

(5.42)

T∗mY = m|b−1((0,∞)),

and

S∗m|b−1((0,∞)) = mY .

By Theorem 5.18, both S and T are locally Lipschitz. In order to prove T and S are
local isometries, we need to compare the functions in W 1,2(Y ) and W 1,2(b−1((0,∞))),
and to prove that Y has the Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property. These require us to know
more information on the metric measure space (X ′, d′, m′), which is the thesis of the next
subsection.

5.5. Estimate on the speed of the projection. For any ﬁxed ˆr, ˆR with ˆR > r′ > ˆr > 0,
pick a function ˆϕ ∈ C ∞(R) with support in ( ˆr
ˆϕ(z) = (z − r′)2

2 , 2 ˆR) so that
on [ˆr, ˆR].

Deﬁne ˆb : X → R as ˆb(x) = ˆϕ◦b(x). Deﬁne the reparametrization function rep : R+×R →
R, rept(r) = rep(t, r) satisfying rep0(r) = 0 and
∂trept(r) = ˆϕ′(r − rept(r))
(5.43)
for any r. We then deﬁne the ﬂow ˆF : R+ × X → X to be

ˆFt(x) = F−rept(b(x))(x).

Lemma 5.21. The following properties hold:

34

(ii): ˆFt is the identity on b−1((−∞, ˆr

2 ])∪b−1([2 ˆR,∞)), ˆFt sends b−1([ˆr, ˆR]) into itself
for every t ≥ 0. ˆFt : X → X is invertible for every t ≥ 0, and for t > 0 we deﬁne
ˆF−t = ( ˆFt)−1.

(iii): The maps ˆFt form a group, i.e. ˆF0 = Id m-a.e. and

ˆFt+s = ˆFt ◦ ˆFs

and in particular ˆFt → Pj uniformly on b−1([ˆr, ˆR]) as t → +∞.
s ∈ [−δ, δ]. In particular,

|d(f ◦ ˆFs)| ≤ (1 + |s|C)|df| ◦ ˆFs
|d ˆFs(v)| ◦ ˆFs ≤ (1 + |s|C)|v|

m-a.e. for every f ∈ W 1,2(X), v ∈ L2(T X) and s ∈ [−δ, δ].

Proof. (i)Obviously, ˆb is Lipschitz, with support in [ ˆr
2 , 2 ˆR]. From the chain rule for Lapla-
cian we see that ˆb ∈ Test(X) and ∆ˆb ∈ L∞(X). Furthermore, recall that by Lemma 5.11,
Hess(b) = 0 on (b−1(0,∞)), hence by the chain rules for Hessian, we have

Hess(ˆb) = ˆϕ′ ◦ bHess(b) + ˆϕ′′ ◦ b∇b ⊗ ∇b = 2∇b ⊗ ∇b

on b−1([ˆr, ˆR]).

(ii) (iii) follows easily from the deﬁnitions. The proof of (iv) and (v) is similar to (iv)

and (v) of Lemma 5.12, we omit the details here.

For the proof of (vi), note that by (5.45), we have

for x ∈ b−1([ˆr, ˆR]) as t → +∞.
Now we prove (vi). In the following, C and δ will denote constants, whose meaning
may change at diﬀerent lines, depending only on X, ˆϕ, ˆr and ˆR. We always require δ < ˆr

and Cδ > −1. Because Fs is a local isometry on b−1((0,∞)), we are easy to see, for every

For any x, y ∈ X, and s ∈ (0, ˆr

If x ∈ b−1([ ˆr
d(F−reps(b(x))(x), F−reps(b(x))(y)) = d(x, y), thus by (5.49),

d( ˆFs(x), ˆFs(y)) ≤ d(x, y)(1 + Cs)

for s ∈ (0, δ], x ∈ b−1([ ˆr

2 , 2 ˆR]) and y suﬃciently close to x. Similarly, since

d( ˆFs(x), ˆFs(y)) ≥ d(F−reps(b(x))(x), F−reps(b(x))(y)) − |reps(b(x)) − reps(b(y))|,

we have

d( ˆFs(x), ˆFs(y)) ≥ d(x, y)(1 − Cs)

we directly have d( ˆFs(x), ˆFs(y)) = d(x, y) for all s. Hence we obtain lip( ˆFs)(x) ≤ 1 + C|s|
for every s ∈ [−δ, δ]. Since X is a geodesic space, we further have Lip( ˆFs) ≤ 1 + C|s| for
every s ∈ [−δ, δ]. The proof is completed.

Except (5.44), the properties in Lemma 5.21 are similar to the properties a)- f) in
Section 3.6.2 of [26]. Using the properties in Lemma 5.21 we can establish the following
proposition:
Proposition 5.22. Let v ∈ L2(T X) and put vs := d ˆFs(v). Then the map s 7→ 1
L1(X) is C 1 and its derivative is given by

If v is also bounded, then the curve s 7→ 1

2|vs|2 ◦ ˆFs is C 1 also when seen with values
in L2(X) and in this case the incremental ratios in (5.50) also converge in L2(X) to the
right hand side.

Proposition 5.22 can be proved by the very similar arguments in Proposition 3.30 of
[26]. The properties of ˆb and ˆFt in Lemma 5.21, except (5.44), are the key ingredient in
the proof. See [26] for a detailed proof.

We have the following corollary of Proposition 5.22:

The following proposition is the main result of this subsection, the proof here is adapted

from that of Proposition 3.32 in [26].
Proposition 5.24. Let [c, d] ⊂ (0,∞) and π be a test plan on X such that b(ηt) ∈ [c, d]
for every t ∈ [0, 1] and π-a.e. η. Then for π-a.e. η the curve ˜η := Pj ◦ η is absolutely
continuous and satisﬁes

| ˙˜ηt| ≤ | ˙ηt|,

for a.e. t ∈ [0, 1].

(5.52)
Proof. Take ˆr, ˆR such that ˆR > r′ > ˆr > 0 and [c, d] ⊂ [ˆr, ˆR]. Denote by A = b−1([ˆr, ˆR])
for convenience. Construct ˆb and ˆFs as at the beginning of this subsection. With a slight
abuse of notation we denote by ˆFs the map from C([0, 1], X) into itself which sends η to
ˆFs ◦ η. It is not hard to prove that πs := ( ˆFs)∗π is a test plan on X.
Recall that for every t ∈ [0, 1] the diﬀerential d ˆFs : L2(T X) → L2(T X) induces a map,
still denoted by d ˆFs, from L2(T X, et, π) to L2(T X, et, πs). See Section 3.6.1 in [26] for a

we conclude that (5.52) holds for π-a.e. η.

5.6. Sobolev Spaces on Y and X. By Proposition 5.24, we can understand the Sobolev
Spaces on X ′ well.
Proposition 5.25. Let [c, d] ⊂ (0,∞), h ∈ Lip(R) with supp(h) ⊂⊂ (0,∞) and identically
1 on [c, d]. Suppose f ∈ L2(X) is of the form f (x) = g(Pj(x))h(b(x)) for some g ∈ L2(X ′).
Then f ∈ W 1,2(X) if and only if g ∈ W 1,2(X ′) and in this case we have
(5.62)

|Df|X(x) = |Dg|X ′(Pj(x))

for m-a.e. x such that b(x) ∈ [c, d].

Proof. Suppose f (x) = g(Pj(x))h(b(x)) ∈ W 1,2(X). Let π′ be any test plan on X ′ and pick
[c′, d′] ⊂ [c, d] with c′ < d′. The map P : X ′ × [c′, d′] → X is given by P (x′, s) := Fs−r′(x′).
P induces a map ˜P : C([0, 1], X ′)×[c′, d′] → C([0, 1], X) such that the curve ˜η(s) := ˜P (η, s)
is given by ˜η(s)
t ) =
g(ηt) for every s. By (3) of Theorem 5.18, we have | ˙˜η(s)

t = P (ηt, s). By construction, for π′-a.e. η we have Pj(˜η(s)

| = | ˙ηt| for any s and a.e. t.

Consider the plan

π := ˜P∗(π′ ⊗ (

d′ − c′L1|[c′,d′])) ∈ P(C([0, 1], X)).

Since X ′× [c′, d′] is a compact set and Ft is locally Lipschitz, we derive that P is Lipschitz.
Combining this with Proposition 5.3 and the assumption that π′ is a test plan, we are
easy to derive that π is a test plan on X.

By construction, we have:

|dtdπ(˜η(s))

t )| ˙ηt|dtdsdπ′(η)

By the arbitrariness of π′, we obtain g ∈ W 1,2(X ′) and

|Df|X(x) ≥ |Dg|X ′(Pj(x))

(5.65)
for m-a.e. x ∈ b−1([c, d]).
Now we go to prove the converse inequality. Suppose g ∈ W 1,2(X ′). Let [c′, d′] ⊂ (0,∞)
such that supp(h) ∈ (c′, d′). Note that supp(f ) ∈ b−1([c′, d′]). Let G : X → R be given by

G(x) := |Dg|X ′ (Pj(x))|h(b(x))| + |g(Pj(x))||h′|(b(x)).
Note that G is in L2(X) and equal to |Dg|X ′ (Pj(x)) for x ∈ b−1([c, d]).
Suppose π is any test plan such that b(ηt) ∈ [c′, d′] for every t ∈ [0, 1] and π-a.e. η. If
we can prove that for π-a.e. η the function t 7→ f (ηt) is equal a.e. on [0, 1] and on {0, 1}
to some absolutely continuous function fη such that

(5.66)

|∂tfη|(t) ≤ G(ηt)| ˙ηt|,

a.e. t ∈ [0, 1],

then by the arbitrariness of π, we conclude

|Df|X(x) ≤ |Dg|X ′(Pj(x))

(5.67)
for m-a.e. x ∈ b−1([c, d]).
Note that Pj : b−1([c′, d′]) → X ′ is Lipschitz. With a bit abuse of notation, we also
denote by Pj the map from C([0, 1], X) to C([0, 1], X ′) sending η to ˜η := Pj ◦ η. It’s easy
to deduce that the plan π′ := Pj∗π is a test plan on X ′. Since g ∈ W 1,2(X ′), for π-a.e. η
the map t 7→ g(˜ηt) is equal a.e. on [0, 1] and on {0, 1} to an absolutely continuous function

NONCOMPACT RCD(0, N ) SPACES WITH LINEAR VOLUME GROWTH

39

g˜η such that |∂tg˜η|(t) ≤ |Dg|X ′ (˜ηt)| ˙˜ηt|. Combining this with Proposition 5.24 we conclude
that, for π-a.e. η,

(5.68)

|∂tg˜η|(t) ≤ |Dg|X ′(˜ηt)| ˙ηt|

holds for a.e. t ∈ [0, 1].

On the other hand, for any absolutely continuous curve η the map t 7→ h(b(ηt)) is

absolutely continuous with

|∂th(b(ηt))| ≤ |h′|(b(ηt))| ˙ηt|

(5.69)
Hence for π-a.e. η the map t 7→ f (ηt) = g(Pj(ηt))h(b(ηt)) is equal a.e. on [0, 1] and on
{0, 1} to the absolutely continuous map t 7→ fη(t) := g˜η(t)h(b(ηt)). By Lemma 4.3.4 in [3]
and (5.68), (5.69), we deduce that (5.66) holds. Thus we complete the proof.

for a.e. t ∈ [0, 1].

(cid:3)

In [27], the authors introduce the notion of ‘measured-length space’, and prove that if
a metric measure space is locally doubling and measured-length, then it has the Sobolev-
to-Lipschitz property (see Proposition 3.18 in [27]).

For (X ′, d′, m′), we have:

Proposition 5.26. (X ′, d′, m′) is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian and a measured-length space.

The inﬁnitesimal Hilbertianity of (X ′, d′, m′) is a direct consequence of Proposition 5.25.
To check that (X ′, d′, m′) is a measured-length space, we just follow the lines in the proof
of Proposition 3.26 in [26], whose idea is to use the good properties of optimal transport
on X (see Theorem 1.1 in [28]), and use Pj to map test plans on X to test plans on X ′.
Besides the good properties of optimal transport on X, the key properties used in the
proof are Proposition 5.3, Proposition 5.24 and that Pj is locally Lipschitz, we omit the
details here.

With the good properties of X ′ established before, we have the following results on the
product metric measure space (Y, dY , mY ), which are direct consequences of Section 3 in
[27].
Theorem 5.27. Let f ∈ L2(Y ). For t ∈ R denote by f (t)(x′) : X ′ → R the function
f (t)(x′) := f (x′, t) and similarly for x′ ∈ X ′ denote by f (x′) : R+ → R the function
f (x′)(t) := f (x′, t). If f ∈ W 1,2(Y ), then

(1) for L1-a.e. t, we have f (t) ∈ W 1,2(X ′);
(2) for m′-a.e. x′, we have f (x′) ∈ W 1,2(R+);
(3) the identity

(5.70)

|Df|2

Y (x′, t) = |Df (t)|2

X ′(x′) + |Df (x′)|2

R+(t).

holds for mY -a.e. (x′, t).

Conversely, if f ∈ L2(Y ) has compact support contained in Y(0,∞) with (1) and (2) hold
Furthermore, Y is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian and has the Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property.

and the right hand side of (5.70) is in L2(Y ), then f ∈ W 1,2(Y ).

Denote by

G := {g : Y → R | g(x′, r) = ˜g(x′) for some ˜g ∈ W 1,2(X ′) ∩ L∞(X ′)},

The following propositions are useful in the study of the Sobolev space on X.

40

XIAN-TAO HUANG

Proposition 5.28. Let h ∈ Lip(R) with supp(h) ⊂⊂ (0,∞) and deﬁne f : X → R by
f (x) = h(b(x)). Then f ∈ W 1,2(X) and
(5.71)

|Df|X(x) = |Dh|R(b(x)) for m-a.e. x.

Proof. Obviously, f is a Lipschitz function, denote by lipX(f ) its local Lipschitz constant.
Similarly for h : R → R, lipR(h) denotes its local Lipschitz constant in the space (R, dEcul).
For any x ∈ X, we have |b(x) − b(y)| ≤ d(x, y) for any y ∈ X, and the equality can be
achieved for any y ∈ R(x), hence we are easy to derive
(5.72)

lipX(f )(x) = lim sup

y→x

|f (x) − f (y)|

d(x, y)

= lim sup
b(y)→b(x)

|h(b(x)) − h(b(y))|

|b(x) − b(y)|

= lipR(h)(b(x)).

Note that |Df|X(x) = lipX(f )(x) holds for m-a.e. x and |Dh|R(t) = lipR(h)(t) for L1-a.e.
t, then combining with Proposition 5.3, we obtain (5.71).
Proposition 5.29. Let g ∈ G and h ∈ H. Then
(5.73)
Proof. By Proposition 5.25, g ∈ S2
with compact support, then h(S(x)) = ˜h(b(x)). By the chain rule of ∇, we have

loc(X). Suppose h(x′, r) = ˜h(r) for some ˜h ∈ Lip(R)

h∇(g ◦ S),∇(h ◦ S)iX = 0,

m-a.e..

(cid:3)

h∇(g ◦ S),∇(h ◦ S)iX = ˜h′ ◦ bh∇(g ◦ S),∇b)iX ,

m-a.e.,

hence to conclude it is suﬃcient to show

(5.74)

h∇(g ◦ S),∇b)iX = 0,

m-a.e..

Recall that by (5.26), for any f ∈ S2

t → h∇f,∇bi weakly in
L2(b−1((0,∞))) as t ↓ 0. Applying this fact to f = g ◦ S, and note that by construction

loc(X), we have f ◦Ft−f

f ◦Ft−f

(cid:3)

t

≡ 0 for any t ≥ 0, hence we obtain (5.74).

Now we can compare the Sobolev space between X and Y . Given an open set U ⊂ X,

Theorem 5.30 can be proved by the very same arguments in [24] or [26]. We sketch the
key ingredient of the proof here, the reader can refer to [24] or [26] for detailed proof. The
proof of Theorem 5.30 is based on the following three facts:

(1): (5.75) holds for f ∈ A. The proof of this fact is based on (5.70), Propositions

details of the argument.

This follows from the facts that S and T are measure preserving and locally Lips-
chitz, see Proposition 6.7 in [24].

5.7. Back to the metric properties and conclusion.

Proof of Theorem 5.4. We will handle Case (2) here. We know T and S are measure
preserving in (5.42). Combining Theorem 5.30 with the fact that both X and Y have the
Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property, the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 5.18 can be
applied to show that T and S are locally isometries. We omit the details here. Now we
will derive the additional conclusions.

For any x0, x1 ∈ b−1((0,∞)), note that (Y, dY ) is a geodesic space, thus there is always
a shortest geodesic σ : [0, 1] → Y with σ(0) = S(x0), σ(1) = S(x1). Since T is a local
isometry, T ◦ σ : [0, 1] → X is a Lipschitz curve of length dY (S(x0), S(x1)) connecting x0
and x1, thus d(x0, x1) ≤ dY (S(x0), S(x1)).
, and suppose x0, x1 ∈ b−1((r1,∞)). Let η : [0, 1] → X be a
shortest geodesic with η(0) = x0, η(1) = x1. η has to be contained in b−1((0,∞)), for
otherwise there is a point z = ηt ∈ b−1((−∞, 0]), then

Now let r1 = diam(X ′)

2

d(x0, x1) = d(z, x0) + d(z, x1) ≥ b(x0) + b(x1)
>|b(x1) − b(x0)| + diam(X ′) ≥ dY (S(x0), S(x1)),

which is a contradiction. Now S ◦ η : [0, 1] → Y is a Lipschitz curve of length d(x0, x1),
and hence d(x0, x1) ≥ dY (S(x0), S(x1)). Thus S : (b−1((r1,∞)), d) → (X ′ × (r1,∞), dY )
is an isometry.
Note that for any x0, x1 ∈ b−1((r1,∞)), suppose σ : [0, 1] → X ′ × (r1,∞) is a shortest
geodesic connecting S(x0) and S(x1), then T◦σ is a shortest geodesic connecting x0 and x1,
hence b−1((r1,∞)) is a geodesic space. Thus by Proposition 7.7 in [1], (b−1((r1,∞)), d, m)
is RCD(0, N ). By the isomorphism S : (b−1((r1,∞)), d, m) → (X ′ × (r1,∞), dY , mY )
and a natural isomorphism between (X ′ × (r1,∞), dY , mY ) and (Y, dY , mY ), we know
(Y, dY , mY ) is also an RCD(0, N ) space. By Corollary 2.5 in [41], the Hausdorﬀ dimension
of (Y, dY , mY ) is at most N . On the other hand, from Corollary 5.20, Y has Hausdorﬀ
dimension at least 2, hence N ≥ 2.
Since (Y, dY , mY ) is an RCD(0, N ) space, and (Y, dY , mY ) is the product of (X ′, d′, m′)
and (R+, dEucl,L1), the argument in Corollary 5.30 and Theorem 7.4 of [24] shows that
(X ′, d′, m′) is an RCD(0, N − 1) space.

The proof is completed.
