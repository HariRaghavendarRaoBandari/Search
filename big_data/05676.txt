Abstract

The universal arithmetic one dimensional solenoid S1Q is the Pontryagin dual of the
additive rationals Q and it is isomorphic to the ad`ele class group AQ/Q. It is also
isomorphic to the algebraic universal covering on the unit circle S1 obtained by the
inverse limit of the tower of its ﬁnite coverings. It is the boundary of the surface
lamination with boundary obtained as the algebraic universal covering of the punc-
tured closed disk ∆ − {0} ⊂ C. The interior of this lamination is the inverse limit
of the tower of ﬁnite coverings of the open punctured disk ∆ − {0}. The latter is
a Riemann surface lamination denoted HQ and it is foliated by densely embedded
copies of the hyperbolic plane H. The boundary of the leaves are densely embedded
copies of R in S1Q. In this framework the pair (S1Q, HQ) is the adelic version of the
pair (R, H). The stage is set to develop the adelic theory of Beltrami diﬀerentials,
Ahlfors-Bers theory, quasi-symmetric homeomorphisms of S1Q and Teichm¨uller the-
ory. This paper is a ﬁrst step towards this goal in parallel with the work by Dennis
Sullivan on the universal Teichm¨uller spaces of Riemann surface laminations.

Introduction

AQ = R ×(cid:81)

p

Since its creation by Claude Chevalley and Andr´e Weil the ring of ad`eles of the rationals
(cid:48) Qp has played a fundamental role in number theory, for instance in on
class ﬁeld theory [RV], [Ta] and the Langlands program. The canonical diagonal inclusion
i : Q → AQ embeds Q as a discrete cocompact subgroup of AQ which we identify with
Q. The quotient AQ/Q is the ad`ele class group with its additive structure is a compact
abelian group and its Pontryagin dual is the additive group of the rationals (Q, +) with
the discrete topology. There is another description of AQ/Q as the inverse limit of all
ﬁnite coverings pn(z) = zn (z ∈ S1, n ∈ Z) of the circle S1. This is a one dimensional
solenoidal compact abelian group in the sense of Pontryagin. It is a sort of “diﬀuse circle”
(a lamination, a current or a foliated cycle in the sense of Sullivan [Su2]) and in fact we
denote this group as

S1Q = Q∨ = Pontryagin dual of Q

to convey the idea that it is a generalization of a circle. This solenoid is a lamination with
dense leaves which are embedded copies of the real line. If we consider S1Q × [0,∞) one
obtains a 2-dimensional lamination with boundary S1Q whose leaves are densely embedded
copies of the closed upper half plane H. The interior HQ = S1Q×(0,∞) is a two dimensional
Riemann surface lamination with hyperbolic dense leaves isometric to the upper half-plane
with the Poincar´e metric. The metric is given explicitly by ds2 = dx2+dt2
where dx is the
natural ﬂat metric on the one dimensional solenoid S1Q. The laminated space HQ is the
adelic hyperbolic upper half-plane. This lamination can also be obtained as the inverse
limit of the the coverings of the closed unit disk ∆−{0}, pn(z) = zn, |z| ≤ 1, n ∈ Z. The
interior of this lamination is the inverse limit of the tower of coverings of the punctured
open unit disk ∆∗ = ∆ − {0}. Another important locally compact abelian group is the
inverse limit of the tower of coverings of C∗, the algebraic solenoid C∗
Q. As a group this
group is isomorphic to S1Q × R• where R• = {t ∈ R : t > 0} is the multiplicative group
of the positive reals. We endow C∗
Q with its Haar measure η. The 2-dimensional solenoid

(1)

Now we have the perfect setting to study the Ahlfors-Bers theory and the correspond-

ing Teichm¨uller theory. This is the main subject of this paper.

We will restrict the considered set of Beltrami diﬀerentials to those whose restrictions
to every leaf and every ﬁber belong to L∞ respectively. A necessary condition for the
existence of a quasiconformal solution to the equation (1) is that µ should be uniformly
vertical continuous: Consider the canonical left action m : ˆZ → Aut(C∗
Q) such that
m(a) is left product by a. We say that µ ∈ L∞(C∗
Q) is uniformly vertical L∞-continuous

if the map ˆZ → L∞(C∗
1 (z) (z ∈ C∗), the restriction µz of a vertical L∞-continuous µ to Fz can
ﬁber Fz = π−1
be represented by a continuous function from ˆZ → C. The function of representatives
C∗ → C 0(ˆZ, C), z (cid:55)→ µz, is not necessarily continuous, actually it could be quite bizarre.
This transversal continuity condition is indeed necessary: if there exists a quasiconformal
solution f µ : ˆCQ → ˆCQ of equation (1), in particular it is uniformly continuous along the
ﬁbers and so must be µ. Here ˆCQ denotes the adelic Riemann sphere: It is the inverse
limit of the branched coverings projective system { ˆC, pn,m}n,m≥1,n|m where pn,m(z) = zm/n
and ˆC is the Riemann sphere.

solutions. An example is given in section 4.

However, this condition is not suﬃcient to ensure the existence of quasiconformal
Among these Beltrami diﬀerentials, we have the periodic ones: We say µ ∈ P er1 is a
periodic adelic Beltrami diﬀerential if there is some natural n and Beltrami diﬀerential
µn ∈ L∞(C)1 such that µ = π∗
n(µn). The importance of periodic adelic Beltami diﬀer-
entials is that they trivially have a quasiconformal solution of their respective Beltrami
equation: Consider the periodic adelic Beltrami diﬀerential µ = π∗
n(µn) and the qua-
siconformal solution fn to the µn-Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. Deﬁne the leaf and
orientation preserving homeomorphism f such that:

ˆCQ

πn 
ˆC

f

ˆCQ

/ ˆC

Then, f is the quasiconformal solution to the µ-Beltrami equation (1).

At this point, it is natural to ask for a topology T such that the interior of the closure
of these Beltrami diﬀerentials constitute new Beltrami diﬀerentials for which there exist
quasiconformal solutions of their respective Beltrami equations; i.e.:

Bel(CQ) = Interior (P er1

The ﬁrst natural guess would be the metric topology T∞ but this doesn’t work since:

Interior (P er1

) = Lvert∞ (C∗

Q)1

and as we said before this is not a suﬃcient condition.

We ﬁnd a family of complete metric topologies TRen,S solving this problem. This is
one of the main results of the paper. However, the optimality of these solutions remains
an open problem. We would like to have suﬃcient and necessary conditions as well.

Compact solenoidal laminations by Riemann surfaces (solenoidal surfaces) appear in
various branches of mathematics. For instance, following an original idea of Dennis Sul-
livan [Su], in the paper in Acta Mathematica [BNS] it is constructed the universal Te-
ichm¨uller space of the solenoidal surface Σ obtained by taking the inverse limit of all
ﬁnite pointed covers of a compact surface of genus greater than one and chosen base
point. The sequence of the chosen base points upstairs in the covers determine a point
and a distinguished leaf L in the inverse limit solenoidal surface. In this space, the com-
mensurability automorphism group of the fundamental group of any higher genus compact
surface acts by isometries. By deﬁnition, this group is independent of the genus.

The space of hyperbolic structures up to isometry preserving the distinguished leaf on

this solenoidal surface Σ is non Hausdorﬀ and any Hausdorﬀ quotient is a point.

The proof of this result relies on the recent deep results due to Jeremy Kahn and
Vladimir Markovi´c on the validity of the Ehrenpreis Conjecture [KM]. The remark by
Sullivan is that the action of the commensurability automorphism group of the funda-
mental group is not only by isometries but also minimal. This action is described in the
paper in Acta Mathematica [BNS] mentioned before.

Concerning Dynamical systems theory, D. Sullivan [Su] studies the linking between
universalities of Milnor-Thurston, Feigenbaum’s (quantitative) and Ahlfors-Bers. As he

in [LM]. Another important application of solenoidal
surfaces follows from the fact that they parametrize tessellation spaces [Gh].

We hope that the theory of adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials developed in this work shed

some new light on these universalities.

In this paper we also describe diﬀerent equivalent Teichm¨uller models. This is a
straightforward generalization of the classical models. The relation with Sullivan’s work
is the following: There is a canonical continuous injective map

TS(1) (cid:44)→ TSullivan(∆∗
∞)

Finally, we construct the p-adic generalization to the Nag-Verjovsky map in [NV]:

ι : Dif fP(S1

p)/RBL (cid:44)→ TP(1)

We prove that this map is diﬀerentiable analytic. This is another main result of the paper.
We would like to point out that one of the motivations of this map was its relation to
string theory [HR], [BR1], [BR2], [Pe]. We believe that the theory developed here could
be applied to p-adic string theory and its relationship with number theory.

2 Adelic solenoid

2.1 Adelic solenoid
In what follows we will identify the group U (1) with the unit circle S1 = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1}
and the ﬁnite cyclic group Z/nZ with the group of nth roots of unity in S1.
By covering space theory, for any integer n ≥ 1, it is deﬁned the unbranched covering
space of degree n, pn : S1 → S1 given by z (cid:55)−→ zn. If n, m ∈ Z+ and n divides m, then
there exists a covering map pn,m : S1 → S1 such that pn◦pn,m = pm where pn,m(z) = zm/n.
We also denote with the same letters the restriction of pn and pn,m to the nth roots of
unity. In particular we have the relation:

pn,m ◦ pm,l = pn,l

This determines a projective system of covering spaces {S1, pn,m}n,m≥1,n|m whose projec-
tive limit is the universal one–dimensional solenoid or adelic solenoid

S1Q := lim
pn←−

S1.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Thus S1Q consists of sequences (zn)n∈N, z∈S1 which are compatible with pn i.e. pn,m(zm) = zn
if n divides m.

determines a locally trivial ˆZ–bundle structure where the group

ˆZ := lim

Z/mZ

is the proﬁnite completion of Z, which is a compact, perfect and totally disconnected
Abelian topological group homeomorphic to the Cantor set. Being ˆZ the proﬁnite com-
pletion of Z, it admits a canonical inclusion of Z ⊂ ˆZ whose image is dense. We have an
inclusion ˆZ φ→ S1Q and a short exact sequence 0 → ˆZ φ→ S1Q
The solenoid S1Q can also be realized as the orbit space of the Q–bundle structure
Q (cid:44)→ A → A/Q, where A is the ad`ele group of the rational numbers which is a locally
compact Abelian group, Q is a discrete subgroup of A and A/Q ∼= S1Q is a compact Abelian
group (see [RV]). From this perspective, A/Q can be seen as a projective limit whose
n–th component corresponds to the unique covering of degree n ≥ 1 of S1Q. The solenoid
S1Q is also called the algebraic universal covering space of the circle S1. The Grothendieck
Galois group of the covering is ˆZ, the algebraic fundamental group of S1Q.

π1→ S1 → 1.

By considering the properly discontinuously free action of Z on ˆZ × R given by

n · (x, t) = (x + n, t − n),

(n ∈ Z, x ∈ ˆZ, t ∈ R)

The solenoid S1Q is identiﬁed with the orbit space ˆZ ×Z R. Here, Z is acting on R by
covering transformations and on ˆZ by translations. The path–connected component of
the identity element 1 ∈ S1Q is called the baseleaf [Od] and will be denoted by RBL.

5

Clearly, RBL is the image of {0} × R under the canonical projection exp : ˆZ × R → S1Q
deﬁned below and it is a densely embedded copy of R.

Hence S1Q is a compact, connected, Abelian topological group and also a one-dimensional
lamination where each “leaf” is a simply connected one-dimensional manifold, homeomor-
phic to the universal covering space R of S1, and a typical “transversal” is isomorphic
to the Cantor group ˆZ. The solenoid S1Q also has a leafwise C∞ Riemannian metric (i.e.,
C∞ along the leaves) which renders each leaf isometric to the real line with its standard
metric dx. So, it makes sense to speak of a rigid translation along the leaves. The leaves
also have a natural order equivalent to the order of the real line hence also an orientation.

Summarizing the above discussion we have the commutative diagram:

where ˆZ is the adelic proﬁnite completion of the integers and the image of the group
monomorphism φ : (ˆZ, +) → (S1Q,·) is the principal ﬁber. We notice that πn(x) = πn(y)
implies πn(y−1x) = 1 and therefore y−1x = φ(a) where a ∈ nˆZ for some n ∈ Z ⊂ ˆZ.

In particular π1 ◦ φ = 1 and Im(φ) ⊂ Ker(π1). Suppose that π1(x) = 1. Then

x = (. . . , an, . . . , am, . . . 1) = (. . . , e2πibn/n, . . . , e2πibm/m, . . . 1) = φ(y)

such that y = (. . . , bn, . . . , bm, . . . 0). We have proved that Ker(π1) ⊂ Im(φ). Be-
cause π1 is an epimorphism and φ is a monomorphism we have the ﬁrst item.

Proof:

exp is epimorphism: Consider x ∈ S1Q and a ∈ R such that eia = π1(x).
Because π1◦ν = eiθ we have that π1(ν(a)) = eia = π1(x); i.e. π1(ν(a)−1x) = 1. By Lemma
2.4 there is an adelic integer b ∈ ˆZ such that φ(b) = ν(a)−1x; i.e. x = φ(b)ν(a) = exp(b, a).
Ker(exp): Suppose that exp(a, θ) = φ(a)ν(θ) = 1. Then φ(a) = ν(−θ) and composing
with π1 we have 1 = e−iθ and θ = 2πk for some integer k. Then

1 = exp(a, 2πk) = φ(a)ν(2πk) = φ(a)φ(k) = φ(a + k)

Because φ is monomorphism we have that a + k = 0. We conclude that a is an integer
and θ = −2πa

• Z acts as translations by ι(Z) and because ι(Z) is discrete in ˆZ × R then Z acts

proper and discontinuously. We conclude that exp is a local homeomorphism.

• By deﬁnition π1 is an open continuous epimorphism. Restricted to a leaf and a

trivializing neighborhood π1 is one to one.

• (x, 2π) + ι(1) = (x + 1, 0) so (x, 2π) ∼ (x + 1, 0).
• The foliation ˆZ × R is invariant under translations by ι(a) for every integer a hence
it induces a foliation in the solenoid. Z is dense in its proﬁnite completion ˆZ and so
is every coset of ˆZ/Z. By the preceding item, we have that every R-leaf is dense in
the solenoid.

Remark 2.1. Because zn = zn and the conjugation has a continuous extension to the
Riemann sphere ¯z : ˆC → ˆC, there is a homeomorphism:

¯z : ˆCQ → ˆCQ

such that πn(¯x) = πn(x) for every x ∈ ˆCQ. Because ¯z = z−1 on S1 this relation extends
to the solenoid S1Q and by continuity we have that the composition:

1/¯z : ˆCQ → ˆCQ
is a leaf preserving homeomorphism ﬁxing 0, 1,∞.
As deﬁned by D. Sullivan [Su]: A two dimensional solenoid is hyperbolic if every leaf is
conformally covered by the disk.

minus the origin. Then HQ is a hyperbolic solenoid.

2.2 Continuous maps and degree theory

The following lemmas and propositions tell us how continuity properties of solenoidal
maps are related to limit periodic properties of their restriction on the baseleaf. For
pedagogical reasons, we introduce the notion of limit periodic as a particular case of
almost periodic functions.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A subset A ⊂ R is relatively dense if there is a real number L > 0 such
that [x, x + L] ∩ A (cid:54)= ∅ for every x ∈ R.

The following deﬁnition is due to Harald Bohr in 1924 [Bo]:

Deﬁnition 2.2. A function f : R → C is almost periodic if for every  > 0 there is a
relatively dense subset A ⊂ R such that:

for every x ∈ R and t ∈ A.

|f (x + 2πt) − f (x)| < 

There is a beautiful discussion of almost periodic functions in the context of construc-
tive mathematics in [Br]. Restricting the reletively dense subsets to be of the form NZ
for some natural N we have:
Deﬁnition 2.3. A function f : R → C is limit periodic if for every  > 0 there is a
natural number N such that:

for every x ∈ R and n ∈ NZ.

|f (x + 2πn) − f (x)| < 

An interesting discussion relating limit periodic functions, solenoids and adding ma-
chines can be found in [Be]. The following generalization is the appropriate one needed
for our subsequent theory:
Deﬁnition 2.4. A function f : C → C is limit periodic respect to x if for every  > 0
and compact set K ⊂ R there is a natural number N such that:

for every z ∈ R × iK and n ∈ NZ.

|f (z + 2πn) − f (z)| < 

Lema 2.9.

• Consider a limit periodic function f : R → C. Then the map f ◦ 2π :
In

Z → C is uniformly continuous respect to the relative adelic topology on Z.
particular, the map extends uniquely to a continuous map on ˆZ.

• Consider a continuous limit periodic respect to x function f : C → C. Then the
map h : Z× C → C such that h(n, z) = f (z + 2πn) extends uniquely to a continuous
map on ˆZ × C.

Proof:
• Consider an  > 0. There is a natural N such that

|f (x + 2πn) − f (x)| < 

for every x ∈ R and n (cid:31) N . In particular, if n − m ∈ NZ then

|f (2πn) − f (2πm)| = |f (2πm + 2π(n − m)) − f (2πm)| < 

• Consider a compact set K ⊂ R and the map l : Z → C(R × K, C) such that

l(n)(z) = h(n, z). Consider an  > 0. There is a natural N such that

|f (z + 2πn) − f (z)| < 

for every z ∈ R × K and n (cid:31) N . In particular, if n − m ∈ NZ then

|f (z + 2πn) − f (z + 2πm)| = |f (z + 2πm + 2π(n − m)) − f (z + 2πm)| < 

for every z ∈ R × K; i.e. l is uniformly continuous
||l(n) − l(m)||∞ < 

hence there is a unique continuous extension ˆl : ˆZ → C(R× K, C). Finally, we have
the unique continuous extension ˆh such that ˆh(a, z) = ˆl(a)(z). Because the real line
is σ-compact and continuity is a local property, we have the result.

(cid:3)

The following Lemma justiﬁes the name of limit periodic maps.

Lema 2.10.

• For every limit periodic map f : R → C there is a sequence (fn)n∈N
such that fn is 2πn-periodic and (fn) converges pointwise to f respect to the divisi-
bility net.

11

• A map f : R → C is continuous limit periodic respect to x if and only if there
is a sequence (fn)n∈N of continuous maps such that fn is 2πn-periodic respect to x
and (fn) uniformly converges to f in bands R × K where K ⊂ R is a compact set,
respect to the divisibility net. Moreover, the sequence (fn)n∈N can be assumed to be
equicontinuous.

Proof:
• Consider F : Z×R → C such that F (n, x) = f (x+2πn). Because f is limit periodic,
by Lemma 2.9 for every x ∈ R the function F ( , x) is uniformly continuous hence
there is an extension ˆF : ˆZ×R → C such that for every x ∈ R the extension ˆF ( , x) is
continuous on the compact ˆZ. Consider the inverse limit morphisms πn : ˆZ → Z/nZ
and deﬁne

fn(x) = n

da ˆF (a, x)

Ker(πn)

where da denotes the normalized Haar measure on the compact abelian group ˆZ.
See that that for every x ∈ R the extension ˆF ( , x) is integrable for it is continuous.
Consider the shift T : ˆZ → ˆZ such that T (a) = a + 1. Because the Haar measure
is invariant under the shift, T n is an automorphism of Ker(πn) and ˆF (T (a), x) =
ˆF (a + 1, x) = ˆF (a, x + 2π) we have that fn is 2πn-periodic:

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

fn(x + 2πn) = n

da ˆF (a, x + 2πn) = n

da ˆF (T n(a), x) = fn(x)

Ker(πn)

Ker(πn)

Finally, for every  > 0 and every x ∈ R there is a natural N,x such that for every
n (cid:31) N we have ˆF (nˆZ, x) ⊂ U ( ˆF (0, x), ). In particular,

|f (x) − fn(x)| ≤ n

da | ˆF (0, x) − ˆF (a, x)| < 

for every n (cid:31) N .

Ker(πn)

• Consider F : Z×C → C such that F (n, z) = f (z + 2πn). Because f is limit periodic
respect to x, by Lemma 2.9 there is a unique continuous extension ˆF : ˆZ × C → C
of F . Consider the inverse limit morphisms πn : ˆZ → Z/nZ and deﬁne

fn(z) = n

da ˆF (a, z)

Ker(πn)

where da denotes the normalized Haar measure on the compact abelian group ˆZ.
Again, see that that for every z ∈ C the extension ˆF ( , z) is integrable for it is
continuous.
Because F (n + 1, z) = F (n, z + 2π) and ˆF is the continuous extension, we have the
relation ˆF (a + 1, x) = ˆF (a, x + 2π) hence there is a continuous function ˆf such that:

Consider the annulus Dr,R where r and R denote the inner and outer radius re-
spectively. Because the solenoid S1Q × [a, b] (cid:39) π−1
1 (Dr,R) is compact, ˆf is uniformly
continuous there hence ˆF is uniformly continuous. Then,for every  > 0 there is
a δ > 0 and a natural N such that ˆF (N ˆZ × U (z, δ)) ⊂ U ( ˆF (0, z), ) for every
z ∈ R × [a, b]. In particular,

|f (z) − fn(z)| ≤ n

da | ˆF (0, z) − ˆF (a, z)| < 

Ker(πn)

for every n (cid:31) N and every z ∈ R × [a, b]; i.e. (fn)n∈N uniformly converges to f in
bands R × K where K ⊂ R is a compact set, respect to the divisibility net. By the
same argument as before, fn is 2πn-periodic.
Let’s see that the family on functions fn is equicontinuous. Deﬁne the continuous
function g : ˆZ × C2 → R such that g(a, z, w) = | ˆF (a, z) − ˆF (a, w)|. Let  > 0 and
z ∈ R. Then ˆZ × ∆ ⊂ g−1(U (0; )) where ∆ ⊂ C2 is the diagonal and because ˆZ is
compact, there is a δ > 0 such that ˆZ × U ((z, z); δ) ⊂ g−1(U (0; )). In particular,
for every w ∈ C such that |z − w| < δ we have g(a, z, w) <  for every a ∈ ˆZ. Then,

da | ˆF (a, z) − ˆF (a, w)| < 

|fn(z) − fn(w)| ≤ n
if |z − w| < δ for every natural n.
Conversely, consider a compact set K ⊂ R and let  > 0. There is a natural N such
that n (cid:31) N implies ||f − fn||∞ < /2 on the band R × K. Deﬁne T : C → C such
that T (z) = z + 2π. Because fn = fn ◦ T n we have:

Ker(πn)

||f − f ◦ T n||∞ = ||(f − fn) − (f ◦ T n − fn ◦ T n)||∞

≤ ||f − fn||∞ + ||f ◦ T n − fn ◦ T n||∞ = 2||f − fn||∞ < 

for every n (cid:31) N ; i.e. f is limit periodic respect to x. Because every fn is continuous
and the convergence is uniform on compact sets, we have that f is continuous.

(cid:3)
The ﬁrst item of the above Lemma is surprising for a non-continuous limit periodic

could be quite bizarre. However, it can always be approximated by periodic functions.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Deﬁne the baseleaf topology on C as the topology such that ν : CBL →

Because of the relation πm ◦ ν = eiz/n and the fact that, by deﬁnition, the topology of
Q is the coarser topology such that every πm is continuous, we have that the following

sets

U = U(cid:48) + 2πmZ

where U(cid:48) ⊂ C is a usual open set and m is a natural number, constitute a basis for the

CBL (cid:39) RBL × R

Another form of the above homeomorphism is the following one:

Remark 2.2. The space CBL is not a topological vector space for the vector space action

Remark 2.3. Because the baseleaf topology is coarser than the usual one, every connected
subset in the usual sense is also connected in the baseleaf sense.

Consider an annulus Dr,R where r and R denote the inner and outer radius respectively.
Because S1Q × [a, b] (cid:39) π−1
1 (Dr,R) is compact and f is continuous, the restrictions of f and
therefore f0 are uniformly continuous; i.e for every  > 0 and natural λ there is a real
number δ,λ > 0 and a natural number N,λ such that

f0(z + 2πNZ + U (0, δ)) ⊂ f0(z) + 2πλZ + U (0, )

(4)

for every z ∈ R × [a, b].
Deﬁne gm such that gm(z) = f0(z + 2πN m) − f0(z) for every integer m. Consider
 < π/2. We will prove that there is an integer k,λ such that gm(R× [a, b]) ⊂ U (2πkm, )
for every integer m. We will prove it in the following steps:

• Base case: Because g1 is continuous and RBL × [a, b] is connected by remark 2.3,

there is an integer k such that g1(R × [a, b]) ⊂ U (2πk, ).

• Induction step: Suppose that gm(R× [a, b]) ⊂ U (2πkm, ) for every natural m ≤ M .
Because gM +1(z) = gM (z + 2πN ) + g1(z) and the inductive hypothesis, we have that
gM +1(R × [a, b]) ⊂ U (2πk(M + 1), π). By equation (4) we have gm(R × [a, b]) ⊂
2πZ + U (0, ) for every integer m. Then,

gM +1(R × [a, b]) ⊂ U (2πk(M + 1), π) ∩ (2πZ + U (0, )) = U (2πk(M + 1), )

• Trivial case: g0(R × [a, b]) = {0} ⊂ U (0, ).
• Negative integers: g−m(R × [a, b]) = −gm(R × [a, b]) ⊂ −U (2πkm, ) = U (2πkm, )

for every natural m.

We have proved a stronger version of equation (4): For every  > 0 and natural number
λ such that  < π/2 there is a real number δ,λ > 0, a natural number N,λ and an integer
k,λ such that

f0(z + 2πN m + U (0, δ)) ⊂ f0(z) + 2πkm + U (0, )

(5)

for every z ∈ R × [a, b] an every integer m.

(cid:48),λ(cid:48) and an integer k(cid:48)

(cid:48),λ(cid:48) such that

Let’s see that the quotient k,λ/N,λ is independent of the  and λ chosen. Consider
(cid:48),λ(cid:48) > 0 such that δ(cid:48) < δ, a natural

f0(z + 2πN(cid:48)m(cid:48) + U (0, δ(cid:48))) ⊂ f0(z) + 2πk(cid:48)m(cid:48) + U (0, (cid:48))

(6)
for every z ∈ R × [a, b] an every integer m(cid:48). Choose m and m(cid:48) such that N(cid:48)m(cid:48) = N m.
Then,

∅ (cid:54)= f0(2πN(cid:48)m(cid:48) + U (0, δ(cid:48))) ⊂ (f0(0) + 2πk.m + U (0, )) ∩ (f0(0) + 2πk(cid:48).m(cid:48) + U (0, (cid:48)))

and because , (cid:48) < π/2 we have that k.m = k(cid:48).m(cid:48) hence k/N = k(cid:48)/N(cid:48). Denote this
, λ-independent rational by q.

15

In particular, because the compact [a, b] was arbitrary, we have proved that

f0(z) = qz + h(z)

where h is continuous limit periodic respect to x: Because f0 is continuous we have that
h is continuous. It rest to show that it is limit periodic respect to x. Because we proved
that the rational q was , λ-independent, equation (5) reads as follows: For every compact
set K ⊂ R and real number  > 0 there is a real number δK, > 0 and a natural number
NK, such that:

h(z + 2πN m) − h(z) = f0(z + 2πN m) − f0(z) − 2πq N m ∈ U (0, )

for every z ∈ R × [a, b] and every integer m. This proves the claim.

Moreover, this decomposition is unique for a linear limit periodic function must be
(cid:3)
zero.
Corollary 2.12. For every uniformly continuous map f : RBL → CBL there is a unique
rational number q and a unique continuous limit periodic function h such that f (x) =
qx + h(x). In particular, f is continuous respect to the usual topologies; i.e. f : R → C
is continuous.

Proof: Because f is uniformly continuous it extends continuously to the completions

hence ˆF (a, ) is holomorphic for every fni is holomorphic. Then f is holomorphic on every

We have proved that for every uniformly continuous map f : RBL → RBL there is

that ˆH is continuous. In particular, the function q : [0, 1] → Q is continuous and because Q

Because f has a continuous extension at zero such that f (0) ∈ C∗ and |f (ν(z))| =
|eih(z)| = e−Im(h(z)), the limit of Im(h) when y tends to +∞ must be ﬁnite for every x.

and by Lemma 2.25 there is a unique rational number q such that f is conformal isotopic
to zq hence L is isomorphic to the complex holomorphic line bundle O(q) with clutching
function the character zq. Because O(p) ⊗ O(q) (cid:39) O(p + q), the result follows.

3.1 Renormalization

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that µ ∈ Lvert∞ (C∗
(Fx)∗(µ) ∈ L∞(ˆZ) for almost every ﬁber Fx : Z (cid:44)→ CQ (i.e. for almost every x ∈ C∗).
Deﬁnition 3.2. Consider the normalized Haar measure η on ˆZ and the induced measure
on the ﬁbers π−1
1 (x). We deﬁne the n-th renormalization map as the linear operator
In : Lvert∞ (C∗

Q) → Lvert∞ (C∗

Q) such that:

The n-th renormalization map is the average respect the n-th level πn : C∗

Q → C∗ of
the algebraic solenoid renormalized such that its operator norm be one; i.e. ||In||∞ = 1.

This is illustrated for the diadic solenoid in Figure 2.

Remark 3.1. See that, by deﬁnition, In(µ) factors through πn; i.e. there is a ˆµn ∈ (cid:32)L∞(C∗)

We say that µ ∈ L∞(C∗
such that (a → µ ◦ m(a)) is continuous at zero.

Q) such that m(a)(x) = φ(a)x.
Q) is uniformly vertical L∞-continuous if the map ˆZ → L∞(C∗

Because π1 ◦ φ = 1 we have π1 ◦ ma = id for every a ∈ ˆZ. This way ma : π−1
1 (x) for every x ∈ C∗ and a ∈ ˆZ; i.e. the ﬁbers are invariant under the action ma for
π−1
every a ∈ ˆZ. To get a feel of this notion of continuity, see that every uniform continuous
function is L∞-continuous. For a less trivial example, see that the Dirichlet function
(D(x) = 1 if x is rational and D(x) = 0 if x is irrational) is L∞-continuous. On the
contrary, the Heaviside or step function (H(x) = 1 if x ≥ 1 and H(x) = 0 if x < 0) is not
L∞-continuous.

• (gn) = I(f ) if and only if (gn ◦ πn)n∈N converges uniformly to f .
Proof:
• Consider a pair of functions f1, f2 ∈ C(S1Q, C) such that I(f1) = I(f2) = (gn). By
deﬁnition In(f1) = In(f2) = gn ◦ πn and because of Lemma 3.4 f1 = f2 for the
sequence (In(fi))n∈N uniformly converges to fi and the limit is unique.

• By deﬁnition In(f ) = gn ◦ πn and because of Lemma 3.4 (gn ◦ πn)n∈N converges
uniformly to f . For the converse, consider a natural n and let  > 0. There is a
natural N ≥ n such that ||f − gN ◦ πN||∞ < . Because IN (gN ◦ πN ) = gN ◦ πN and
||IN||∞ = 1 we have ||In(f ) − gN ◦ πN||∞ <  hence || ˆfN − gN||∞ < . By the fact
that ||Rn,N||∞ = 1 we have || ˆfn − gn||∞ <  and because  > 0 was arbitrary we
conclude that ˆfn = gn.

Proposition 3.6. For every C m+1 function f : S1Q → C such that m ≥ 0 its Pontryagin
series converges in the C m-topology.

Proof: Let’s see how the operator Rm,n acts on monomials:

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

Rm,n(zλn/m)(x) = m/n

yλn/m = m/n

xλ = xλ

yn/m=x

yn/m=x

for every x ∈ S1 hence Rm,n(zλn/m) = zλ. Consider a natural r such that 1 ≤ r ≤
(n/m) − 1. Choose a solution y(cid:48) of the equation yn/m = x. The set of points y/y(cid:48) such
that yn/m = x is the set of (n/m)-th roots of unity. If r|(n/m) then the set of points
(y/y(cid:48))r such that yn/m = x is the set of (n/mr)-th roots of unity otherwise the set of
points is the set of (n/m)-th roots of unity as before. Either way, because the sum of all
k-th roots of unity is zero for arbitrary k, we have that:

Then, for every x ∈ S1 we have:

yn/m=x

Rm,n(zλn/m+r)(x) =

(cid:88)

yr = y(cid:48)r (cid:88)
(cid:88)

yr = 0

yλn/m+r =

hence Rm,n(zλn/m+r) = 0 for r = 1, 2, . . . (n/m) − 1.

By remark 3.1 and Lemma 3.4, In(f )0 is C m+1 and 2πn-periodic hence its Fourier

series converges in the C m-topology; i.e. we have that:

and it converges in the C m-topology for every natural n.
Claim: The coeﬃcients a(n)

are independent of n.

q

In particular we have that:

ˆfn(z) =

and it converges in the C m-topology for every natural n and because the linear operator
Rm,n is bounded (i.e. continuous, actually ||Rm,n|| = 1) we have:

ˆfm(z) = Rm,n( ˆfn)(z) = Rm,n

i/m = a(n)

Then, there are coeﬃcients aq ∈ C indexed on the rationals such that:

and the series converges in the C m-topology. Because the solenoid is compact, in particular
it also converges in L2 and because the Potryagin series is unique, we have the result. (cid:3)
Corollary 3.7. For every C∞ function f : S1Q → C its Pontryagin series converges in
the C∞-topology.

Corollary 3.8. The linear operator In : Lp(S1Q, C) → Lp(S1Q, C) has operator norm
||In||p = 1 for every 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.

Proof: We already have the result for p = ∞. Because the operator In acts as a
projection on modes, by Proposition 3.6 we have that, restricted to the C 1 functions, the
linear operator In : C 1(S1Q, C) → C 1(S1Q, C) has operator norm ||In||p = 1 for every p > 1.
Because C 1(S1Q, C) is dense in Lp(S1Q, C) for every p > 1, there is a unique extension of
In with the same norm.
(cid:3)
Now, with these new tools at hand, we are able to tackle the problem we discuss at

the beginning as a motivation.

Proof: Consider a C 1 function f with its Pontryagin series:

We deﬁne the adelic Riemann sphere ˆCQ as the inverse limit of the ramiﬁed coverings:

with the natural inverse limit maps ˆπn : ˆCQ → ˆC where ˆC is the Riemann sphere. We
have the canonical inclusion C∗

Q (cid:44)→ ˆCQ and the new points:

∞ = [(. . . ,∞,∞,∞)]

0 = [(. . . , 0, 0, 0)]

Because these are the inverse limit of the ramiﬁcation points, their topological nature is
quite diﬀerent from the other points. They are cusps. In particular, every homeomorphism
of ˆCQ must ﬁx these new points or permute them. In the following theory, this ﬁxation
will be a constraint of the theory and no longer a choice as in the classical theory.
Now we turn to the question of whether continuous maps and diﬀerentials on the algebraic
solenoid C∗
Lema 4.1. Consider a continuous (holomorphic) map f and a continuous (holomorphic)
function limit periodic respect to x function g such that:

Q can be extended to the adelic sphere ˆCQ.

Then:

• f can be continuously extended to CQ if and only if there is a complex number a

such that:

Moreover, the extension is f (0) = a.

• f can be continuously extended to C∗

Q∪{∞} if and only if there is a complex number

b such that:

y→−∞||b − g|Im(z)≤y ||∞ = 0

lim

Moreover, the extension is f (∞) = b.

Proof: We prove the ﬁrst item for the second one is completely analogous. It a simple

calculus exercise to see that the extension f (0) = a is continuous if and only if:

||a − f||π1(x)|≤r ||∞ = 0

lim
r→0

Because f is continuous and the image of the baseleaf ν is dense, the above condition is
equivalent to the one in the statement for π1 ◦ ν(z) = eiz hence |π1(ν(z))| ≤ r if and only
if Im(z) ≥ −ln(r) and we have the result.
(cid:3)
Lema 4.2. Consider a diﬀerential µ ∈ C(C∗
Q)dπ1 ⊗ (dπ1)−1 and a diﬀerential η ∈
C(C)d¯z ⊗ (dz)−1 such that η = ν∗(µ) where ν is the baseleaf. Then, as a function µ
has a continuous extension to the whole adelic sphere ˆCQ if and only if there are con-
stants a, b such that:

lim

y→+∞||a.e2i Re(z) + η|Im(z)≥y ||∞ = 0
y→−∞||b.e2i Re(z) + η|Im(z)≤y ||∞ = 0

lim

Moreover, as a function the extension is µ(0) = a and µ(∞) = b.

Proof:

If µ(x) = f (x)dπ1 ⊗ (dπ1)−1 then η(z) = ν∗(µ)(z) = f ◦ ν(z)(−e−2i Re(z))d¯z ⊗
(dz)−1. Because taking the pullback of the diﬀerentials only adds a phase −e−2i Re(z) of
(cid:3)
unit norm, by Lemma 4.1 we have the result.
Q → C∗
Lema 4.3. Consider a continuous (holomorphic) baseleaf preserving map f : C∗

If ||Im(g)||∞ < ∞ then f has a continuous extension ﬁxing 0,∞ to the whole adelic
sphere ˆCQ.

Proof: Deﬁne M and m such that m ≤ Im(g(z)) ≤ M for every z ∈ C. Because
Im(deg(f )z + g(z)) > y if Im(z) > (y − m)/deg(f ) we have that f is continuous at zero.
Analogously, because Im(deg(f )z + g(z)) < y if Im(z) < (y − M )/deg(f ) we have that
f is continuous at ∞.

Let’s see how a homeomorphism permute leaves. Consider a homeomorphism h : C∗

Because ˆZ is totally disconnected, ˆh maps leaves to leaves; i.e. there are homeomor-
phisms s : ˆZ → ˆZ and fa : C → C such that ˆh(a, z) = (s(a), fa(z)). The structural
condition implies s(a + q) = s(a) + p for every a ∈ q ˆZ.
In particular we have that
s(qn) = s(0) + pn for every integer n and because s is continuous we have:

s(qa) = s(0) + pa
for every a ∈ ˆZ. We have proved the following lemma:
Q → C∗

Proof: Under the notation of the above Lemma, if h is leaf preserving then s(a) = a+λ
such that λ is now an integer. In particular, deg(h) = 1 and by Lemma 2.14 h is homotopic
to z. For the converse, z is leaf preserving and because the space of leaves ˆZ/Z is totally
(cid:3)
disconnected h is leaf preserving too.
Since we want to build a theory of continuous deformations of the identity, the above
corollary shows that we only need leaf preserving homeomorphisms in our theory.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A leaf preserving homeomorphism h of ˆCQ is quasiconformal if it ﬁxes

Deﬁnition 4.2. We say µ ∈ P er is a periodic adelic diﬀerential if there is some natural n
and diﬀerential µn ∈ L∞(C) d¯z⊗(dz)−1 such that µ = π∗
n(µn). We say that µ is a periodic
Beltrami adelic diﬀerential if µ ∈ P er and ||µ||∞ < 1. We denote these diﬀerentials as
P er1.

The importance of the periodic adelic Beltami diﬀerentials is that they trivially have a
quasiconformal solution to the respective Beltrami equation: Consider the periodic adelic
Beltrami diﬀerential µ = π∗
n(µn) and the quasiconformal solution fn to the µn-Beltrami
equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. Deﬁne the leaf and orientation preserving homeomorphism f such
that:

Then, f is the quasiconformal solution to the µ-Beltrami equation. At this point, it is
natural to ask for a topology T such that the interior of the closure of these Beltrami
diﬀerentials constitute new Beltrami diﬀerentials for which there exist quasiconformal
solutions to their respective Beltrami equations; i.e.:

Bel(CQ) = Interior P er1

T

The ﬁrst natural guess would be the metric topology T∞ but this won’t do for:

Interior P er1

and there are L∞-vertical Beltrami diﬀerentials µ for which there is no solution to its
Beltrami equation (See example 4.1).
The rest of the chapter is devoted to this problem and we will ﬁnd a family of complete
metric topologies TRen,S solving it. However, the optimality of these solutions remains an
open problem.

4.2 Adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials

In what follows, we will make the following abuse of notation:
Remark 4.1. Every leaf νa : C (cid:44)→ C∗

of Beltrami diﬀerentials L∞(C) dz ⊗ (dz)−1 embeds in this space via π∗

1(dz))−1 = µ ◦ π1 dπ1 ⊗ (dπ1)−1

Q) dπ1 ⊗ (dπ1)−1 with L∞(C∗

In pursuit to ease the notation we will make the following abuse of notation: Unless
confusion, in what follows we will write a diﬀerential µ dπ1 ⊗ (dπ1)−1 just as µ and
identify L∞(C∗
Q); i.e. we will use the same notation to denote
the diﬀerential and the function. Unless explicitly written, the context will make clear
which one we are using.
Deﬁnition 4.3. An adelic diﬀerential is an element µ ∈ L∞(CQ) such that:

• µ is vertical and horizontal essentially bounded; i.e. ν∗

νa and F ∗(µ) ∈ L∞(ˆZ) for every ﬁber F : ˆZ (cid:44)→ CQ.

a(µ) ∈ L∞(C) for every leaf

• µ is vertical L∞-continuous; i.e. µ ∈ Lvert∞ (C∗
Q)
• There is a coﬁnal totally ordered divisibility subsystem S = (nj)j∈N such that the

following series converge:

∞(cid:88)

j=1

nj+1 ||Inj+1(µ) − Inj (µ)||∞ < ∞

We will call the above series as an S-renormalized average series. The set of adelic
diﬀerentials with a convergent S-renormalized average series will be denoted by RenS.
For every µ ∈ RenS we deﬁne its renormalized norm as:

||µ||Ren,S = n1 ||In1(µ)||∞ +

nj+1 ||Inj+1(µ) − Inj (µ)||∞ < ∞

j=1

such that S = (nj)j∈N. An adelic Beltrami diﬀerential is an adelic diﬀerential µ such that
||µ||∞ < 1 and the set of adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials with convergent S-renormalized
average series will be denoted by BelS(CQ).
Remark 4.2. Is clear that (RenS, || · ||Ren,S) is a metric space.
Deﬁnition 4.4. Deﬁne the vector subspaces of adelic diﬀerentials:

P ern = π∗

Proposition 4.8. BelS(CQ) is a Banach manifold modeled on RenS, || · ||Ren,S).

Proof: By the previous Lemma, BelS(CQ) ⊂ RenS is an open set and it only rest
|| · ||Ren,S) is complete. Consider a Cauchy sequence (µn)n∈N in

the same argument and the fact that (µn)n∈N is a Cauchy sequence we have:

||µ − µm||Ren,S = 0

and we conclude that µ ∈ RenS and it is the limit of the Cauchy sequence.

Theorem 4.9. For every adelic Beltrami diﬀerential µ there is a unique quasiconformal
leaf preserving solution f : ˆCQ → ˆCQ to the µ-Beltrami equation such that f ﬁxes 0, 1,∞.

Remark 4.3. If f is a solution to the µ-Beltrami equation then µ must be uniformly
vertical continuous for µ = ∂¯zf /∂zf . This is why we ask for the L∞-vertical continuous
condition in the adelic diﬀerential deﬁnition (See corollary 3.2).

Before presenting the proof of the adelic version of the Ahlfors-Bers theorem, it is
important or at least pedagogical to describe some problems within and understand the
capricious nature of the adelic Beltrami diﬀerential deﬁnition.

By Ahlfors-Bers theorem, there is a quasiconformal solution ha for every leaf modulo
postcompositions with aﬃne transformations. In particular, the solutions can be chosen
such that they verify the structural constraint:

ha+1(z) + 2π = ha(z + 2π)

for every z ∈ C and a ∈ ˆZ deﬁning this way a leaf preserving map h : ˆCQ → ˆCQ ﬁxing
0,∞. However, there is a priori no reason to expect that the resulting map would be
continuous. Is clear that it will be continuous along the leaves but in general not across
them. It’s like drawing a picture separately in every piece of a puzzle and expect that the
we get a clear picture after we put the pieces together. We have decomposed the foliated
object in leaves and solved the problem for each leaf. To assure a continuous solution we
need a global structural constraint.

The natural guess is that imposing some notion of vertical continuity (L∞-vertical
continuity) to the Beltrami diﬀerential would give the desired continuity of the solution
across the leaves. Although this is a necessary condition, it is not enough. As the next
example shows, even for a continuous Beltrami diﬀerential there is no need to continuity
of the solution across the leaves.

Example 4.1. Consider the following function:

(cid:2)cos(x/n!) − 2iy
(cid:80)+∞
(cid:2)cos(x/n!) + 2iy

Because it is limit periodic respect to x and decays to zero when y tends to ±∞, by
Lemmas 2.16 and 4.2 there is a continuous adelic Beltrami diﬀerential ˆµ on C∗
Q with a
continuous extension to the whole adelic sphere ˆCQ as a function such that µ = ν∗(ˆµ)
where ν is the baseleaf.

There is no continuous map ˆw such that

The above example shows that we still need some other global structural condition on
the Beltrami diﬀerential to assure the continuity of its solution. This is precisely the con-
vergence of the renormalized average series: There is a coﬁnal totally ordered divisibility
subsequence S = (nj)j∈N such that the following series converge:

The following deﬁnitions and Lemmas are the prelude to the Ahlfors-Bers theorem:
Theorem 4.10. Consider k such that 0 ≤ k < 1. Then, there exists a real number
p > 2 only depending on k such that: For every Beltrami diﬀerential µ ∈ L∞(C)1 with
||µ||∞ ≤ k and compact support there is a unique quasiconformal map f : C → C such
that f (0) = 0 and fz − 1 ∈ Lp(C) (globally and not merely locally) verifying:

on C in the sense of distributions.

A map verifying the conditions of the theorem is called a normal quasiconformal solution.
The previous Theorem can be found in [Ah], [IT].

Lema 4.11. If f is a normal solution of the µ-Beltrami equation such that µ has compact
support, then there are constants A and p > 2 such that:
|f (ζ) − ζ| ≤ A||µ||∞|ζ|1−2/p

Moreover, the constant A is monotone respect to the area of the µ support and depends
also on p.

Proof: By general theory [Ah], [IT], there is 2 < p < ∞ such that:

f (z) = P (f¯z)(z) + z

where P is the following linear operator on Lp(C):

is uniformly H¨older continuous with exponent 1 − 2/p and veriﬁes P h(0) = 0. Moreover,
there is a constant Kp depending only on p such that:

|P h(ζ)| ≤ Kp||h||p|ζ|1−2/p

for every ζ ∈ C. The map µ (cid:55)→ f¯z ∈ Lp(C) from the space of Beltrami diﬀerentials with
compact support is Lipschitz continuous; i.e. There is a constant C such that:

||f¯z||p ≤ C||µ||p ≤ C Area(support(µ))1/p||µ||∞

Combining these relations, there is 2 < p < ∞ such that:

|f (z) − z| = |P (f¯z)(z)| ≤ Kp||f¯z||p|z|1−2/p

≤ (cid:0)KpC Area(support(µ))1/p(cid:1)||µ||∞|z|1−2/p

and we have the Lemma.

Lema 4.12. If f is a normal solution of the µ-Beltrami equation such that µ has compact
support, then there are constants B and p > 2 such that:

|ζ| ≤ B||µ||∞|f (ζ)|1−2/p + |f (z)|

Moreover, the constant B is monotone respect to the area of the µ support and depends
also on p.

that:

Now, let’s see that it is normal. Consider the normal quasiconformal solution g to

and an analogous expression for g outside the disk. Substituting these expansions in
equation (9) and comparing the leading term we get λ = 1. Because of the following

and the claim is proved.

• Consider the quasiconformal normal maps f1 and f2 with respective Beltrami dif-
ferentials µ1 and µ2. Their composition is a quasiconformal map ﬁxing the origin
with Beltrami diﬀerential µ with compact support. Consider the quasiconformal
normal solution g to the µ-Beltrami equation. Again, because g and f1 ◦ f2 are
quasiconformal solutions of the same equation and both ﬁx the origin, there is a
non zero λ such that:

(10)

g = λf1 ◦ f2

44

In the same way as before, because µ, µ1 and µ2 have compact support, they are
univalent outside a disk of suﬃciently large radius R and we can write:

g(z) = z + b0 +

b1
z

+

b2
z2 + . . .

and an analogous expressions for f1 and f2 outside the disk. Substituting these
expresions in equation (10) and comparing the leading terms we get λ = 1 just as
before. This proves the claim.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.4. The above Lemma explains why we choose this normalization. The Douady-
Hubbard normalization f (z) − z ∈ O(1/|z|) is easy to work with but doesn’t necessarily
ﬁx the origin and as we said before, this is no longer a choice but a constraint of the new
theory. The normalization f (0) = 1 and f (1) = 1 is compatible with the maps z (cid:55)→ zn
of the inverse system. However, it is very diﬃcult to control the growth of the maps in
terms of their respective Beltrami diﬀerentials. The above Lemma shows that the chosen
normalization is compatible with the inverse system with the advantage of having some
control on the maps.

Lema 4.18. Under the same hypothesis of corollary 4.15 and previous deﬁnition of the
maps ˆfni, there is a continuous leaf preserving map ˆf : ˆCQ → ˆCQ such that ( ˆfni)i∈N
converges pointwise to ˆf .

Proof: For each L = nJ , Lemma 4.17 implies that (πL ◦ ˆfni)i∈N is a uniform Cauchy
sequence on compact sets so there is a continuous function gL : CQ → C such that
the sequence (πL ◦ ˆfni)i∈N converges uniformly to gL on compact sets. Consider another
L(cid:48) = nJ(cid:48) such that J(cid:48) > J. Because zL(cid:48)/L ◦ πL(cid:48) ◦ ˆfni = πL ◦ ˆfni for every i ≥ J(cid:48) and the
continuity of zL(cid:48)/L we have that zL(cid:48)/L ◦ gL(cid:48) = gL. By the universal property of inverse
limits there is a unique function ˆf : CQ → CQ such that πni ◦ ˆf = gni for every natural i.
Because every gni is continuous we have that ˆf is continuous and veriﬁes that (πL◦ ˆfni)i≥J
converges uniformly to πL ◦ ˆf on compact sets. In particular, ( ˆfni)i∈N converges pointwise
to ˆf .
Let’s see that ˆf is proper: Consider a compact set K ⊂ ˆCQ. The compact K is closed
for every compact subset of a Hausdorﬀ space is also compact and because ˆf is continuous,
ˆf−1(K) is closed. By Lemma 4.16 and the fact that ( ˆfni)i∈N converges pointwise to ˆf , we
have that for every L = nJ there is a constant M(cid:48)

L such that:

|πL(x)| ≤ M(cid:48)

L|πL ◦ ˆf (x)|

Choose some natural L = nJ . Deﬁne R such that d(0, πL(K)) = R < ∞ for πL is
continuous; i.e. πL(K) is compact. By the above relation we have that

d(0, πL( ˆf−1(K))) ≤ M(cid:48)

LR

and because πL is proper, the closed set ˆf−1(K) is contained in the compact π−1
LR))
hence ˆf−1(K) is compact and we have the claim.
In particular, the extension ˆf : ˆCQ → ˆCQ such that ˆf (∞) = ∞ is continuous and
because ˆfni(∞) = ∞ for every natural i, we have that ( ˆfni)i∈N converges pointwise to ˆf
on ˆCQ. In particular, by deﬁnition every ˆfni is leaf preserving and so is ˆf . This ﬁnishes
(cid:3)
the proof.

L (D(0; M(cid:48)

Theorem 4.19. For every adelic Beltrami diﬀerential µ there is a unique quasiconformal
leaf preserving solution f : ˆCQ → ˆCQ to the µ-Beltrami equation such that f ﬁxes 0, 1,∞.

Proof:

(Uniqueness) Suppose that f and g are quasiconformal solutions to the µ-
Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. Then, f ◦ g−1 is leaf preserving 1-quasiconformal ﬁxing
0, 1,∞. By Lemmas 2.13, 2.14 and Corollary 4.6 there is a holomorphic limit periodic
respect to x function h such that ν−1◦ f ◦ g−1◦ ν(z) = z + h(z) where ν is the baseleaf. On
the other hand, by Weyl’s Lemma ν−1 ◦ f ◦ g−1 ◦ ν is a holomorphic homeomorphism of
C; i.e. an aﬃne transformation. Because it ﬁxes zero, we have that ν−1 ◦ f ◦ g−1 ◦ ν = id
hence f ◦ g−1 = id and f = g.
(Existence) First suppose that µ has compact support in CQ. Consider an arbitrary leaf
ν : C → C∗
Q ⊂ ˆCQ. Under the same notation and deﬁnitions as before, by Lemma 4.18
there is a continuous baseleaf preserving map ˆf : ˆCQ → ˆCQ such that ( ˆfni)i∈N converges
Q → C∗
pointwise to ˆf . By Lemmas 4.15 and 4.16, actually we have the restriction ˆf : C∗

(cid:17)

(cid:0)(eiz/ni)−1 ◦ fni ◦ eiz/ni(cid:1)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and because ˆfni and ˆf are leaf preserving, the compositions ν−1◦ ˆfni ◦ ν and ν−1◦ ˆf ◦ ν are
well deﬁned. Moreover the sequence (ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν)i∈N converges pointwise to ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν.
Claim: The maps ν−1◦ ˆfni◦ν are quasiconformal solutions of the respectives ν∗(Ini(µ))-

Beltrami equations. We have the following diagram:

Because the front, behind , left and right faces commute, the bottom face commutes.
We already know that ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν is continuous by Lemma 2.13 (or just because it is
conjugated to a continuous function by a covering map). Locally the inverse of the map
eiz/ni exists and we have

Because ∂zfni ∈ L2,loc(C), by the above identity the same holds for ∂z
. An
analogous result holds for the other derivative. Finally, ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν is the solution of the
Beltrami equation with Beltrami diﬀerential

ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν

(eiz/ni)∗(µni) = (πni ◦ ν)∗(µni) = (ν)∗(πni)∗(µni) = (ν)∗(Ini(µ))

Deﬁne the aﬃne maps Ai(z) = aiz + bi such that A−1

This proves the claim.
i ◦ ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν is the quasicon-
formal solution of the ν∗(Ini(µ))-Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞ (See remark 4.5 below).
Concretely:

ai = ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν(1) − ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν(0)

bi = ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν(0)

Because ( ˆfni)i∈N converges pointwise to ˆf , the sequence of aﬃne maps (Ai)i∈N converges
locally uniformly to the map A(z) = az + b such that:

a = ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν(1) − ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν(0)

b = ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν(0)

A priori a could be zero. Deﬁne the map g as the quasiconformal solution of the ν∗(µ)-
Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. Because Ini(µ) tends to µ in L∞(CQ) we have that
ν∗(Ini(µ)) tends to ν∗(µ) in L∞(C) and by Lemma 4.20 we conclude that:

locally uniformly. Then:

i ◦ ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν → g
A−1

ν−1 ◦ ˆfni ◦ ν = Ai ◦ A−1

and we conclude that:

ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν = A ◦ g

Because ˆf is continuous and ﬁxes 0,∞ it cannot be constant. In particular a (cid:54)= 0 and
we have that ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν is a quasiconformal solution of the ν∗(µ)-Beltrami equation for
every leaf ν. Finally, ˆf is a homeomorphism for every continuous bijective map between
compact sets is a homeomorphism. We have proved that ˆf is quasiconformal. Multiplying
by ˆf (1)−1 we have the quasiconformal solution ﬁxing 0, 1,∞.
Now we remove the hypothesis of the compact support of µ by the standard well known
trick: Deﬁne µ1 = µ.χ|π1(z)|≥1 and consider the M¨obius inversion γ : ˆCQ → ˆCQ such that
γ(z) = 1/z. Because γ∗(µ1) has compact support on CQ, by the previous part there is
a unique quasiconformal leaf preserving solution g : ˆCQ → ˆCQ to the γ∗(µ1)-Beltrami
equation such that g ﬁxes 0, 1,∞. Deﬁne f1 such that the following diagram commutes:

ˆCQ

γ

ˆCQ

/ ˆCQ

Claim: The map f1 is the quasiconformal solution of the µ1-Beltrami equation ﬁxing
0, 1,∞: Because γ and g are homeomorphisms ﬁxing 0, 1,∞ so is f1. For every leaf νa we
have the diagram:

Because every νa is injective and the left, right, top, bottom and front sides commute we
have that the back face also commutes. By deﬁnition ν−1−a ◦ g ◦ ν−a is a quasiconformal
a ◦ f1 ◦ νa is a quasiconformal solution
solution of the ν∗
of the (−z)∗ ◦ ν∗

−a ◦ γ∗(µ1)-Beltrami equation so ν−1
−a ◦ γ∗(µ1)-Beltrami equation. We have:

(−z)∗ ◦ ν∗

−a ◦ γ∗(µ1) = (γ ◦ ν−a ◦ (−z))∗(µ1) = ν∗

and this proves the claim.

clearly quasiconformal leaf preserving and ﬁxes 0, 1,∞ for it is the composition of maps
of the same kind. Because:

(cid:3)
Remark 4.5. At ﬁrst sight it seems there is something terribly wrong in the above proof:
While ˆf ﬁxes 0,∞ and has only one degree of freedom as a solution of the µ-Beltrami
equation, its conjugated map ν−1 ◦ ˆf ◦ ν has two degrees of freedom. Why the conjugated
map has an extra degree of freedom? Let’s see: The conjugated map has the same freedom
as ˆf plus the property of being uniformly limit periodic on horizontal bands. Once this
last property is destroyed by an aﬃne transformation, an extra degree of freedom comes
out.

Remark 4.6. We have also proved that:

• The map ˆf in Lemma 4.18 is in fact quasiconformal.
• A 1-quasiconformal map of ˆCQ ﬁxing 0, 1,∞ is the identity.

The following Lemma is Proposition 4.36 of [IT]:

Proposition 4.20. If µn tends to µ in L∞(C) then f µn tends to f µ locally uniformly.

Lema 4.21. Consider adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials µn, µ and consider their respective

Corollary 4.22. Consider adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials µn, µ and consider their respective

to µ in the Banach space (BelS(CQ), || · ||Ren,S), then (fn)n∈N converges pointwise to f .
As a ﬁnal remark, consider the morphism φ : ˆZ × C → S1Q × S1 given by φ(a, x + iy) =
(exp(a, x), eiy). Because Ker(φ) = Ker(exp) the morphism factors through exp and we

Remark 4.7. The 2-adic case of the above construction, S1
in [Su]. As it was commented there, this is the basic solenoidal surface required in the
dynamical theory of Feigenbaum’s Universality [Fe]. We hope that our theory of adelic
Beltrami diﬀerentials could shed some new light on the link between this univeraslity and
the Ahlfors-Bers one.

4.4 Inﬁnitesimal deformations

Now we turn the discussion to inﬁnitesimal deformations. We discuss it in the general
˙f [η] where
case and then apply it to the p-adic case. We need an appropriate notion of

and (ni)i∈N = S.

Proof: Consider ν ∈ T0BelS(CQ) = RenS, the tangent space of the S-adelic Beltrami
diﬀerentials at zero. Recall formula (4.24). For every x ∈ S1Q and naturals m, n such that
m|n we have:

where S = (ni)i∈N is coﬁnal totally ordered divisibility subsystem under consideration,
the sequence ( ˙f [Ini(ν)])i∈N is a Cauchy sequence in the complete space of continuous

that the sequence ( ˙f [In(ν)])n∈N converges uniformly to it respect to the divisibility net.

5 Teichm¨uller space

(cid:3)

5.1 Teichm¨uller models
1 (D(0; 1)) ⊂ CQ and the set BelS(HQ) of S-adelic
Model A: Deﬁne the compact HQ = π−1
Beltrami diﬀerentials with support in HQ where S is a coﬁnal totally ordered divisibility
subsequence. See that the solenoid S1Q is the boundary of HQ. For every µ ∈ BelS(HQ)
deﬁne the extension:

(cid:16) ¯z

(cid:17)2

z

˘µ(z) = µ(1/¯z)

for every z ∈ CQ such that π1(z) > 1. It is easy to see that ˘µ ∈ BelS(CQ) is actually an
S-adelic Beltrami diﬀerential. By theorem 4.19 there is a unique quasiconformal solution
f µ to the ˘µ-Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. Because ˘µ = (1/¯z)∗(˘µ) we have that

f µ(1/¯z) =

1

f µ(z)

By remark 2.1, the solenoid S1Q and hence HQ are invariant under f µ. Deﬁne the following
equivalence relation on BelS(HQ): µ ∼A η if f µ|S1Q = f η|S1Q. The universal Teichm¨uller
space is deﬁned as the quotient:

B : BelS(HQ) → TS(1) = BelS(HQ)/ ∼A

with the quotient topology induced by (BelS(HQ), || · ||S). Although we have the usual
group structure µ (cid:63) ν = η if f µ ◦ f ν = f η, unfortunately the space BelS(HQ) is not closed
under this product.
The following Lemma shows the relation between this Teichm¨uller space with the Sulli-
van’s one [Su].

Proposition 5.1. We have a continuous canonical injective map:

TS(1) (cid:44)→ TSullivan(∆∗
∞)

56

Proof: In the same way as in the classical case, by Weyl’s Lemma every adelic Beltrami
diﬀerential deﬁnes a complex structure on every leaf of HQ = ∆∗
∞ in Sullivan’s notation
and we have a map ϑ : BelS(HQ) → TSullivan(∆∗
∞). Because there is a bounded homotopy
respect to the hyperbolic metric between ϑ(µ) and ϑ(η) if and only if f µ|S1Q = f η|S1Q, there
is an injective map  such that:

BelS(HQ)

B
TS(1)

ϑ



/ TSullivan(∆∗
∞)

By the same reason as before and Corollary 4.22, ϑ is continuous for pointwise conver-
gence of continuous maps to a continuous map on a compact set (the solenoid S1Q in our
case) is actually uniform. In particular, if (µn)n∈N converges to µ in the Banach space
(BelS(CQ), ||·||Ren,S), then d(ϑ(µn), ϑ(µ)) tends to zero where d is the Teichm¨uller metric
deﬁned in [Su]. Because the topology of TS(1) is induced by the one in BelS(HQ), we
(cid:3)
have that  is continuous.
Model B: This is the model of quasisolenoids ﬁxing the unit . Deﬁne the compact
) ⊂ CQ. Now, for every µ ∈ BelS(HQ) consider the quasiconformal
Q = π−1
H∗
solution fµ to the µ-Beltrami equation ﬁxing 0, 1,∞. See that fµ|H∗Q is univalent on every
leaf. In fact, the application of the theory of univalent functions in Teichm¨uller theory is
one of Bers great accomplishments.
Deﬁne the following equivalence relation on BelS(HQ): µ ∼B η if fµ|H∗Q = fη|H∗Q. The

c
1 (D(0; 1)

universal Teichm¨uller space is deﬁned as the quotient:
TS(1) = BelS(HQ)/ ∼B

with the quotient topology induced by (BelS(HQ), || · ||S).
Lema 5.2. Consider µ, η ∈ BelS(HQ). Then, f µ|S1Q = f η|S1Q if and only if fµ|H∗Q = fη|H∗Q.
Proof: (Modulo technicalities, the proof is almost verbatim as the one in [IT]). Deﬁne

the map g : CQ → CQ such that:

(cid:26) f µ ◦ (f η)−1(z) z ∈ HQ

z

z ∈ H∗

Q ∪ S1Q

g(z) =

The map g is clearly leaf preserving continuous. For every leaf νa, the map ν−1
explicitly given by:

a ◦ g ◦ νa is

(cid:26) ν−1

a ◦ g ◦ νa(z) =
ν−1

a ◦ f µ ◦ (f η)−1 ◦ νa(z) Im(z) > 0
Im(z) ≤ 0

z

and by deﬁnition A it is quasiconformal and we have that g is quasiconformal. The map
(fµ)−1 ◦ g ◦ fη is 1-quasiconformal and ﬁxes 0, 1,∞ hence by remark 4.6 it is the identity.

Corollary 5.3. Teichm¨uller space models A and B are homeomorphic.

Model C: Here we present the quasisymmetric model.
Deﬁnition 5.1. A leaf preserving homeomorphism f : S1Q → S1Q is quasisymmetric if for
a ◦ f ◦ νa is quasisymmetric. Denote the space of these
every leaf νa the map fa = ν−1
quasisymmetric maps by QS(S1Q).

The following Lemma is the Beurling-Ahlfors Theorem [BA]:

Lema 5.4. A real homeomorphism is quasisymmetric if and only if it admits a quasicon-
formal extension to the upper half plane.

The next Lemma is the adelic analog.

Lema 5.5. A map on the solenoid S1Q is quasisymmetric if and only if it admits a quasi-
conformal extension to HQ.

Proof: Consider a quasisymmetric map f : S1Q → S1Q. By almost verbatim Lemmas
2.13, 2.14 and Corollary 4.6, there are limit periodic functions ha : R → R such that
a ◦ f ◦ νa(x) = x + ha(x) and ha+1(x) = ha(x + 1) where νa is a leaf. Deﬁne
fa(x) = ν−1
wa : U → U such that:

wa(x + iy) =

1
2

dt [(1 + i)fa(x + ty) + (1 − i)fa(x − ty)]

(23)

Because every fa is quasisymmetric the map wa is quasiconformal for every leaf νa.
a ◦ ˆw ◦ νa for every leaf νa.
Claim: There is a homeomorphism ˆw of HQ such that wa = ν−1
A direct calculation shows that there are continuous limit periodic maps ga respect to
x such that wa(z) = z + ga(z) and ga+1(z) = ga(z + 2π). By Lemma 2.9 there is a
continuous map w : ˆZ × U → ˆZ × U such that w(a, z) = (a, wa(z)) and w(a + 1, z) =
w(a, z+2π)+(1,−2π). By Lemma 2.7 we have a continuous map ˆw such that the following
diagram commutes:

HQ − {0}

exp

ˆZ × U

ˆw

w

/ HQ − {0}

exp

ˆZ × U

wa=id+ga

U

It rest to show that ˆw can be extended to a homeomorphism on HQ. Consider the
continuous extension to the boundary w : ˆZ× R× [0, +∞) → ˆZ× R× [0, +∞) and deﬁne
w(+∞) = +∞. Deﬁne the following neighborhood basis at +∞:

(cid:90) 1

0

(cid:110){+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × (y, +∞)

(cid:111)

such that

y ≥ 0

See that {+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × [0, +∞) with the above basis at +∞ is compact. Because
every w0 : R × [0, +∞) → R × [0, +∞) is a homeomorphism, for every y ≥ 0 the

preimage of the compact R × [0, y] is a compact set hence there is some y(cid:48) ≥ 0 such that
w0(R × (y(cid:48), +∞)) ⊂ R × (y, +∞). Because wn(z) = w0(z + 2πn) − 2πn we have that
wn(R × (y(cid:48), +∞)) ⊂ R × (y, +∞) for every integer and because the sequence (wn)n ∈ N
converges locally uniformly on horizontal bands respect to the divisibility net, we have
that wa(R × (y(cid:48), +∞)) ⊂ R × (y, +∞) for every a ∈ ˆZ taking a bigger y(cid:48) if necessary; i.e.
w is continuous at +∞. Then w is a homeomorphism on {+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × [0, +∞) for a
continuous bijective map between compact sets is a homeomorphism. Deﬁne exp(+∞) =
Is clear that exp : {+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × [0, +∞) → HQ ∪ S1Q is continuous hence a

homeomorphism for the same reason as before. Because the following diagram commutes:

exp

{+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × [0, +∞)

ˆw

w

/ HQ ∪ S1Q

exp

{+∞} ∪ ˆZ × R × [0, +∞)

the map ˆw is a homeomorphism. This proves the claim.
A complete analogous construction to the one before gives the commutative diagram:

where the maps on the top square are homeomorphisms and every wa is quasiconformal.
By equation (23) we have the relation wa(¯z) = wa(z) hence ˆw is a quasiconformal map
ﬁxing 0,∞ such that:

ˆw(1/¯z) =

1

ˆw(z)

In particular, the map ψ : TS(1) → BelS(HQ) such that ψ(f ) = µ ˆw deﬁnes a section of
the proyection B: B ◦ ψ = id.
For the converse, consider a map f : S1Q → S1Q such that there is a quasiconfor-
mal map ˆw : HQ → HQ with continuous extension f . Because ˆw is a leaf preserving
a ◦ ˆw ◦ νa is
homeomorphism of HQ then the continuous extension f is so and because ν−1
a ◦ f ◦ νa is quasisymmetric for every leaf νa. (cid:3)
quasiconformal then by Lemma 5.4 ν−1
Because the baseleaf ν is a morphism it deﬁnes leaf preserving left action ρ : RBL → S1Q
such that ρ(a)(x) = ν(a)x where a ∈ R and x ∈ S1Q. This action is the translation
along the leaves. By conjugation, it deﬁnes a left action on QS(S1Q) such that a.f =
ρ(a) ◦ f ◦ ρ(a)−1.
Consider a coﬁnal totally ordered divisibility subsequence S and the subspace QSS(S1Q)
of restrictions of quasiconformal solutions of S-adelic Beltrami diﬀerentials. Deﬁne the
Teichm¨uller space TS(1) as the quotient:

TS(1) = QSS(S1Q)/RBL (cid:39) QSS(S1Q)1

where QSS(S1Q)1 denote those maps ﬁxing the unit. By the previous Lemma we have:

5.2 p-adic case

In the same way we deﬁned the adelic (algebraic) solenoid we deﬁne the p-adic one S1
p) as the inverse limit of the inverse system zpn : S1 → S1( zpn : C∗ → C∗). The main
p
(C∗
diﬀerence is that the Pontryagin dual of the p-adic solenoid S1
p is now the set of characters
zq such that q = m/pn for some integer m and natural n. The ﬁber of S1
p as a ﬁber bundle
π1 : S1
Remark 5.1. It is worth noting the following fact: Continuous real or complex valued
functions on the p-adic or adelic integers need not to be locally constant. In fact:

p → S1 is now the group of p-adic integers Zp.

• Consider the homeomorphism h between the 2-adic integers and the usual cantor

set such that:

h(a2a2a3 . . .) = 2 · 0.a1a2a3 . . .

where ai denote the 2-adic numerical ﬁgures on the left side and the right side is the
corresponding real number in basis three. Because the Cantor set is a subset of the
real line, we have a continuous not locally constant function. In view of the Cantor
set characterization, we have the same example on any perfect, compact and totally
disconnected space.

• The p-adic norm ||·||p on the p-adic integers is continuous and not locally constant

at zero.

• Actually, on any compact space X we have: A continuous function f : X → R is

locally constant if and only if its image is a ﬁnite set.

It is worth to note also that the directional derivative is the only one that makes sense
on Zp for every linear map φ : Zp → C is trivial hence every linear action ρ : φ : Zp →
AutC(C) (cid:39) C is trivial too. In particular there can be no diﬀerential neither derivative,
only directional derivative. Physically, the heuristic reason is that there is no natural
extension of the total order relation of Z to Zp and this can be seen in the following way:
Geometrically, the (oriented) directions through the 0 point are the equivalence classes
of monomorphisms Z (cid:44)→ Zp such that two of them are equivalent if they are non trivial
(positive) integer multiples. Because every linear map m : Z (cid:44)→ Zp is a monomorphism
if and only if it is of the form m(x) = ax for some a ∈ Z∗
p, we have that the space of
directions are points of the projective space:

P (Zp) = Z∗

p/Z∗

where the quotient is respect to the multiplicative structures. Because this space is far
from being trivial, we have multiple directions so the directional derivative is the one that
makes sense.

Taking the analogy further, the space of oriented directions, the p-adic version of S1,

can be considered as the boundary of Zp:

∂Zp = Z∗

p/Z∗

+

60

and is the double covering of the projective space:
∂Zp → P (Zp)
p has the boundary ∂Zp × S1 or some dynamical
It seems that the p-adic solenoid S1
suspension of ∂Zp with some monodromy map. We wonder whether these ideas connect
to tropical geometry.

In the same way we deﬁned a notion of vertical uniform continuity in L∞ we deﬁne

the notion of vertical uniform derivative:
Deﬁnition 5.2. Recall the left action m : Zp → Aut(C∗
say that µ ∈ L∞(C∗

p) has uniformly vertical L∞-derivative dµ/dZp if

p) such that ma(x) = φ(a)x. We

dµ
dZp

= lim
a→0

µ ◦ ma − µ

||a||p

∈ L∞(C∗
Q)

As an example, consider the p-adic integers Zp with its p-adic norm ||·||p. By deﬁnition,
the p-adic norm is continuous on this space. Let’s see that it has a directional derivative
at every point. If x (cid:54)= 0 then there is some natural number N such that a ∈ NZp imply
||x + a||p = ||x||p hence its derivative is zero at x. However, its directional derivative at
zero is one for every direction. We have proved that the derivative exists and equals the
delta Kronecker:

Lema 5.7. Consider a vertical L∞-continuous µ ∈ L∞(C∗
p) such that there is a converging
S-renormalized average series. Then and dµ/dZp exists along the direction determined by
S and it is zero; i.e:

d ||x||p
dx

= δ0
x

(cid:12)(cid:12)S = 0

dµ
dZp

Proof: There is a subsequence (nj)j∈N of (pn)n∈N such that 8 holds. In particular, the

non-renormalized average series converges:

∞(cid:88)

||Inj+1(µ) − Inj (µ)||∞ < ∞

and because of Lemma 3.1 we have:

j=1

µ = In1(µ) +

+∞(cid:88)
(Inj+1(µ) − Inj (µ))

j=1

Recall that ma(x) = φ(a)x and φ(a) ∈ Ker(πn) imply πn(φ(a)x) = πn(x) for πn is a group
morphism. Because φ(a) ∈ Ker(πn) if and only if a ∈ nZp, we have that π−1
n (πn(x)) is
invariant under the action ma such that a ∈ nZp. In particular, because the measure is

61

invariant under ma, we have that In(µ ◦ ma) = In(µ) for every a ∈ nZp. Then,

(cid:3)

Moreover, we conjecture the following:

Conjecture 1. In the p-adic case, the renormalized average series condition in the adelic
Beltrami diﬀerential deﬁnition can be substituted by the condition dµ/dZp = 0. We don’t
mean these conditions are equivalent, we mean that the whole theory that follows, in
particular Ahlfors-Bers theorem, holds with this alternative condition.
In what follows, we will take the sequence P = (pn)n∈N0 and in pursuit of alleviating the
notation, when there were no confusion, we will make the following abuses:

• Denote || · ||P = || · ||Ren,P.
• Denote In = Ipn.
• For every complex continuous function f from the solenoid, algebraic solenoid or
the adelic sphere, denote In(f ) = In(f ◦ ν) and ||f||P = ||f ◦ ν||P where ν is the
baseleaf.

• For degree zero maps f , by Lemma 2.17 there is a complex function g such that

f = ν ◦ g. Denote ||f||P = ||g||P.

• We will omit the notation making reference to orientation an leaf preserving p-
adic solenoidal diﬀeomorphisms: Dif f +
p). Instead, we will denote
the orientation and leaf preserving p-adic solenoidal C m-diﬀeomorphisms ﬁxing the
unit by Dif f m(S1
p)1. The same abuses hold for the p-adic solenoidal quasisymmetric
maps QS(S1

p) = Dif f (S1

Lema 5.8. (RenP, || · ||P) is a Banach algebra.

62

Proof: By Proposition 4.8 (RenP, || · ||P) is a Banach space and it rest to proof that

for every f, g ∈ RenP. Denote I−1 = 0. In the p-adic case we have the graded algebra:

such that A0 = P er1 and Aj = P erpj − P erpj−1. Moreover, for every f ∈ P erP we have:

where anly a ﬁnite amount of terms in the sum are zero and every one of them satisfy the
property:

In(f ) − In−1(f ) ∈ An

for every natural n ∈ N0. Consider f, g ∈ P erP. Then f g ∈ P erP and by the argument
above we have:

In(f g) − In−1(f g) =

Because of the following fact:

∂ ˙f [η] = η

in distributional sense on every leaf where ∂ = d¯z ∂¯z, we have that ∂¯zF = 0 on every leaf
of HQ in distributional sense. By Weyl’s lemma on every leaf, F is holomorphic on HQ
such that the real part of its continuous extension to the solenoid is the function deﬁning
˙f [η] respect to d/dπ1. The only derivation F satisfying this property is the continuous
one such that:

(cid:88)

q>0

ν∗(F )(z) = 2

aqeiqz d
dz

Because the imaginary part of its continuous extension to the solenoid is the function
deﬁning ˙f [iη] respect to d/dπ1, we conclude that:

(cid:32)

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

(cid:33)

d
dx

ν∗( ˙f [iη])(x) =

−i

aqeiqx + i

aqeiqx

q>0

q<0

and this proves the result for ˙f [iη] = ˆJ( ˙f [η]).

Corollary 5.12. The automorphism ˆJ deﬁnes a complex structure.
