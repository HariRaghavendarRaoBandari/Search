ABSTRACT

We present observations of SN 2015bn (= PS15ae = CSS141223-113342+004332 = MLS150211-
113342+004333), a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift z = 0.1136. As well as being one
of the closest SLSNe I yet discovered, it is intrinsically brighter (MU ≈ −23.1) and in a fainter host galaxy
(MB ≈ −16.0) than the other SLSNe at z ∼ 0.1. We used this opportunity to collect the most extensive dataset
for any SLSN I to date, including deep and densely-sampled spectroscopy and photometry, from the UV to the
NIR, spanning −50 to +250 days in the rest-frame from optical maximum. SN 2015bn is a slowly-declining
SLSN, but exhibits surprising undulations in the light curve on a timescale of 30-50 days, which are more
pronounced in the UV. The spectrum largely resembles other SLSNe I, but our well-sampled data reveal ex-
traordinarily slow evolution except for a rapid transformation between +7 and +20-30 days. We detect weak
features that we tentatively suggest may be due to hydrogen and helium. At later times, very blue colours and a
distinctive trio of lines around 6000 Å seem to distinguish slowly-declining SLSNe like SN 2015bn from their
faster counterparts. We derive physical properties including the bolometric luminosity, and ﬁnd slow velocity

evolution and non-monotonic temperature and radial evolution. Models powered by magnetar engines and cir-
cumstellar interaction can explain most of the observed properties but seem to require novel density structures,
while 56Ni-powered models giver relatively poor ﬁts. A 130 M(cid:12)pair-instability model shows good spectral
agreement between 5500-8500 Å at 250 days, but is too dim by an order of magnitude at bluer wavelengths. A
late-time radio observation rules out a healthy off-axis γ-ray burst with a typical energy ∼ 1051 erg, and also
excludes an extended progenitor wind with a mass-loss rate 10−2.7 (cid:46) ˙M/v10 (cid:46) 10−2 M(cid:12) yr−1, which is at the
lower end of the density needed to power the late-time optical luminosity through continued circumstellar in-
teraction. We show that further radio observations over the next few years can be used to break the degeneracy
between the magnetar and interaction models.

1. INTRODUCTION

The parameter space of observed supernovae (SNe), in
terms of luminosity, duration and energy, has expanded dra-
matically since the turn of the century. Much of this progress
has occurred thanks to surveys that can cover large areas of the
sky every night, without an inherent galaxy bias. Examples
include Pan-STARRS1 (PS1; Kaiser et al. 2010), the Palo-
mar Transient Factory (PTF; Rau et al. 2009), the Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009), the
La Silla QUEST survey (LSQ; Baltay et al. 2013), and the All-
Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee
et al. 2014). One of the most surprising results has been the
discovery of ‘superluminous supernovae’ (SLSNe; Quimby
et al. 2011; Gal-Yam 2012), which reach peak absolute mag-
nitudes −21 (cid:38) M (cid:38) −23 mag and thus are intrinsically brighter
than normal Type I and Type II SNe by at least 2 magnitudes.
Unveiling the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of these
events is crucial for our understanding of massive star evolu-
tion. Due to their luminosity, they have also generated interest
as potential standard candles for high-redshift cosmology (In-
serra & Smartt 2014).

Traditionally, bright SNe indicate that a large mass of ra-
dioactive 56Ni was synthesized in the explosion; its subse-
quent decay to 56Co and then 56Fe provides the sustained
power input to keep the ejecta hot despite rapid expansion.
The peak luminosity in SLSNe (> 1044 erg s−1) would require
several solar masses of 56Ni, yet late-time observations sug-
gest MNi < 1 M(cid:12) (Pastorello et al. 2010; Quimby et al. 2011;
Inserra et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2013). Furthermore, estimates
of the ejected mass in SLSNe suggest (cid:104)Mej(cid:105) ∼ 10 M(cid:12) (Nicholl
et al. 2015b), whereas a helium core mass of (cid:38) 40 M(cid:12) is re-
quired to synthesize a sufﬁciently high 56Ni mass (Moriya
et al. 2010).

SLSNe are divided observationally into hydrogen-poor
(Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes (Gal-Yam
2012). When hydrogen is present in the spectrum, it usu-
ally appears in the form of strong, multi-component emission
lines (e.g. Smith et al. 2007), almost certainly indicating in-
teraction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Such objects
are classiﬁed as ‘SLSNe IIn’, by analogy with the fainter SNe
IIn, which show narrow Balmer lines from shocked CSM. In
SLSNe IIn, the luminosity is generated in the conversion of

kinetic energy to radiative energy by shocks from the ejecta-
CSM collision. However, a small fraction of SLSNe II are
dominated by broader Balmer lines (Miller et al. 2009; Gezari
et al. 2009; Benetti et al. 2014), and in such cases the power
source is less clear-cut.

Hydrogen-poor SLSNe show spectral similarities to nor-
mal Type Ic core-collapse SNe, and hence have been termed
SLSNe I or Ic. Interaction models can also match the light
curves here (e.g. Chevalier & Irwin 2011; Ginzburg & Bal-
berg 2012; Chatzopoulos et al. 2013), although presumably
the CSM must be deﬁcient in hydrogen to hide its spec-
tral signature (in fact, no narrow lines of any kind are de-
tected). However, the most popular model for SLSNe I is
one in which the ejecta are heated internally by a central en-
gine, in many ways similar to long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(LGRBs; Duncan & Thompson 1992; Woosley 1993; Mac-
Fadyen & Woosley 1999). The essential difference is that the
engine timescale in SLSNe is comparable to the ejecta diffu-
sion timescale, whereas in LGRBs, most of the energy is input
very early (Metzger et al. 2015). In this way, more of the en-
ergy in SLSNe goes into late-time observable radiation rather
than driving a jet. The leading candidate for this engine is the
spin-down of a nascent millisecond magnetar (Kasen & Bild-
sten 2010; Woosley 2010), though fallback accretion on to a
black hole has also been proposed (Dexter & Kasen 2013).

A few SLSNe I do exhibit slow light curve decline rates that
appear consistent with 56Co decay, and have been suggested
to arise from pair-instability SNe (PISNe) in progenitors with
initial mass MZAMS > 130 M(cid:12) (Gal-Yam et al. 2009). How-
ever, other properties, such as their blue colours (Dessart et al.
2012) and relatively fast rise times (Nicholl et al. 2013) ar-
gue against this interpretation. Moreover, their spectroscopic
evolution in the photospheric phase closely resembles other,
faster SLSNe I, suggesting that the slow-decliners may be
high-mass analogues of the more typical events (Nicholl et al.
2013, 2015b). Recently, Jerkstrand et al. (2016) computed
nebular phase spectra for PISN explosion models, ﬁnding
them to be highly discrepant with observed spectra of these
objects at ∼ 400-500 d after explosion.

In this paper, we present and analyse SN 2015bn, which
is one of the closest SLSNe I yet discovered. Its redshift of
z = 0.1136 puts it behind only PTF10hgi (z = 0.098; Inserra

et al. 2013) and PTF12dam (z = 0.107; Nicholl et al. 2013) in
terms of published SLSNe I. We have used this rare oppor-
tunity to collect one of the largest and most densely sampled
datasets for any SLSN. The paper is structured as follows.
We discuss the discovery of the SN in section 2, photometry
in 3, and spectroscopic observations in section 4. In section
5, we construct the bolometric light curve and use it to derive
physical properties, which we model in section 6. Our optical
analysis is supplemented with the ﬁrst late-time radio obser-
vation of a SLSN, presented in section 7. We describe the host
galaxy of SN 2015bn in section 8, before concluding with a
discussion of our ﬁndings in section 9.

2. DISCOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION

The transient was ﬁrst discovered by the Catalina Sky Sur-
vey on 2014 December 23. With photometry from only one
night at R = 18.87± 0.28 mag, it appeared to be an unremark-
able transient at that time. The Mount Lemmon Survey (a di-
vision of CRTS) detected the same transient on 2015 February
11 at R = 16.95± 0.18 mag, and the Pan-STARRS Survey for
Transients (PSST; Huber et al. 2015) discovered it indepen-
dently on 2015 February 15 at wP1 = 16.95± 0.01 mag. The
transient therefore has three different survey designations:
CSS141223-113342+004332, MLS150211-113342+004333,
and PS15ae. The IAU name from the Transient Name Server1
is SN 2015bn. We will use this name throughout the paper.
The sky coordinates are α = 11h33m41s.55, δ = +00o43(cid:48)33(cid:48)(cid:48).4
(J2000.0). Images of the ﬁeld before and after explosion are
shown in Figure 1.

In PESSTO (Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Tran-
sient Objects; Smartt et al. 2015) we ingest all publicly avail-
able transients into a database and cross-match to ensure that

objects are not duplicated, and photometry from multiple
surveys are used together in constructing their light curves.
Within the PESSTO marshall, SN 2015bn was identiﬁed as
an unusual transient by human scanners: it exhibited a long
rise time and bright apparent magnitude, and was coincident
with a faint host galaxy. It was therefore prioritized for spec-
troscopic classiﬁcation, and was observed by PESSTO on
2015 February 17 using EFOSC2 on the ESO New Technol-
ogy Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The classiﬁca-
tion spectrum is available on WISeREP2 (Yaron & Gal-Yam
2012). It showed good matches with young SLSNe I such as
PTF12dam and PTF09cnd (Le Guillou et al. 2015), and in-
dicated a redshift z ∼ 0.11. Subsequent detection of narrow
lines from the host galaxy conﬁrmed z = 0.1136 – making it
one of the most nearby SLSNe to date. On 2015 February 27,
Drake et al. (2015) also reported a spectrum, agreeing with
our classiﬁcation.

3. PHOTOMETRY

3.1. Imaging data reduction

Follow-up imaging observations of SN 2015bn were trig-
gered with a number of instruments. Optical data in ugriz
were obtained with the 2.0-m Liverpool Telescope (LT) us-
ing the IO:O imager, and the 1.0-m Las Cumbres Obser-
vatory Global Telescope network (LCOGT). At later times,
deep ugriz images were obtained with EFOSC2 on the NTT.
These images were reduced by respective facility pipelines
(the PESSTO pipeline is described by Smartt et al. 2015),
including de-biasing and ﬂat-ﬁelding. PS1 data obtained in
the wP1-band were converted to the more standard r-band by
a shift of +0.1 magnitudes. The same shift was applied to
CRTS R-band data to match the better-sampled r-band. These

the UV to NIR. Magnitudes are given in their ‘natural’ systems: AB
for ugriz; Vega for the others. Constant offsets (labeled) have been
added for clarity. (Nicholl et al. 2015a).

shifts were calculated from the observed spectra. UBVRI
data were obtained from the 16" Ritchey-Chretien telescope
(SLT) at Lulin Observatory, Taiwan. These were reduced us-
ing standard techniques in IRAF, correcting for bias, ﬂat-ﬁeld
and dark current. Near-infrared (NIR) images were taken us-
ing SOFI on the NTT and NOTCam on the Nordic Optical
Telescope (NOT). These were reduced using the PESSTO
pipeline, and the external IRAF package NOTCAM (version
2.5)3, applying ﬂat-ﬁelding and sky-subtraction on dithered
frames.

Photometric measurements were made on the reduced
frames using a custom PYRAF photometry pipeline, calling
standard DAOPHOT routines to ﬁt the point-spread function
(PSF) and capture the SN ﬂux. The nightly zero-points, in AB
magnitudes, were calculated using a sequence of local ﬁeld
stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release
12 (Alam et al. 2015). For the SLT photometry, the SDSS
ugriz magnitudes of the sequence stars were transformed into
UBVRI using the equations from Jordi et al. (2006). These are
reported in the Vega magnitude system. Errors in the SN mag-

nitudes include both the scatter in the zero-points and the un-
certainty in the PSF ﬁt returned by DAOPHOT. ASAS-SN pho-
tometry was computed using a dedicated pipeline. Because
SN 2015bn was close to the limiting magnitude for ASAS-
SN (≈ 17 mag), we increased the signal-to-noise ratio of the
data using a noise-weighted stacking of neighbouring epochs.
We activated our approved Swift-GI program dedicated to
the study of nearby SLSNe (PI: Margutti), as well as a num-
ber of other Target-of-Opportunity programs (PI: Inserra). We
also include public data obtained under a separate program
(PI: Brown). Imaging was taken with the Ultraviolet and Op-
tical Telescope (UVOT), in the ﬁlters uvw2, uvm2, uvw1, u, b
and v. The SN ﬂux was extracted following standard methods
(Brown et al. 2009) and using a 5” aperture, and calibrated
in the Swift photometric system (Poole et al. 2008). A shift
of +1.02 mag4 was used to convert the Swift u zeropoint from
Vega to AB system, in order to match our u-band photometry
from LT. All photometric measurements, including epochs of
observation, instruments, and reference star magnitudes, are
given in the Appendix.

3.2. Observed light curves

The observed light curves of SN 2015bn, from UV to NIR,
are shown in Figure 2. SN 2015bn reached r-band maximum
light on MJD 57102. At r = 16.7 mag, it exhibits the bright-
est apparent magnitude of any SLSN I yet discovered. The
ﬁrst detection from CSS is 88 d earlier, which translates to
79 d in the rest-frame at z = 0.1136. This makes SN 2015bn
a slowly evolving SLSN with one of the longest rise times to
date, similar to the estimate for iPTF13ehe (Yan et al. 2015).
To ﬁll in the gap from this ﬁrst detection until our classiﬁca-
tion and follow-up campaign beginning at −28 d, we searched
archival images from PS1 and ASAS-SN. We recovered de-
tections in V - (ASAS-SN), i-, and z-bands (PS1), conﬁrm-
ing the long rise. While the wavelength and temporal sam-
pling is extremely dense during our follow-up campaign, the
pre-classiﬁcation photometry is relatively sparse. This makes
it difﬁcult to constrain the shape of the light curve at early
times. Many SLSNe I exhibit a non-monotonic rise to maxi-
mum brightness, with a fainter initial peak, or ‘bump’. These
bumps have been clearly detected for a number of individual
objects (Leloudas et al. 2012; Nicholl et al. 2015a; Smith et al.
2016). Recently, Nicholl & Smartt (2016) have shown that a
number of literature objects are also consistent with an un-
dersampled bump, and the relative faintness of this ﬁrst peak
makes it difﬁcult to exclude in most cases. We will address
the issue of a bump versus a smooth rise in the next section.

In Figure 3, we show the historical magnitudes measured at
the location of SN 2015bn by CRTS/CSS (Drake et al. 2009).
For clarity, we plot only the average detection limit, although
there are many historic non-detections (the SN 2015bn host,
at R ∼ 22 mag, is well below the survey limit – see section

tometry.

8). The CSS photometry shows two possible source detec-
tions (marked as unﬁlled stars on Figure 3) prior to the un-
ambiguous SN photometry (ﬁlled stars and circles). The later
point appears to be consistent with a detection of the SN it-
self, and could ﬁt with a detection soon after explosion for
both a smooth rise or a non-monotonic bump. Unfortunately,
the image itself is not available for analysis, and the detection
may not be real. As can be seen in Figure 1, there is a star
with rSDSS = 21.53 mag and a probable galaxy with similar
or slightly fainter brightness (though not listed in the SDSS
photometric catalogue) within ≈ 6” of the SN 2015bn host,
as well as a galaxy with rSDSS = 20.83 mag located 12” away
(also visible in the CSS reference stack). It is possible that
poor seeing conspired to blend some of these nearby sources
together, giving the appearance of a single source close to the
survey limit (A. Drake, private communication). There is a
similar detection at R = 20.83 mag on MJD 53005 (not shown
on this scale). The other point, at MJD 56807 (2014 May 30)
is well above the detection limit. However, other CSS im-
ages taken on the same night show no source brighter than
R = 20.6 mag, suggesting that this detection is most likely not
real. Without the actual CSS image, we cannot check the ve-
racity of this solitary point.
If real, this would be the ﬁrst
detection of historic variability at the location of a SLSN I
(either a pre-explosion outburst or another SN in the same
galaxy). We will not speculate further on the nature these
early ‘detections’, and exclude them from the rest of our anal-
ysis.

3.3. Rest-frame light curves and colour evolution

To convert our photometry to absolute magnitudes in the
rest-frame of the SN, we correct for distance modulus, extinc-
tion, and differences in rest-frame ﬁlter wavelengths (the K-
correction)5. We use the dust maps of Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner
(2011) to correct for Milky Way extinction with E(B − V ) =
0.022, and assume negligible extinction in the SN host. This
assumption is necessary, as the host emission lines are too
weak to use reliably for an estimate of internal reddening

5 We assume a ﬂat ΛCDM Cosmology with H0 = 70kms−1 Mpc−1, ΩM =

0.27, ΩΛ = 0.73 throughout this work.

Figure 4. Absolute rest-frame light curves in ugriz, including ex-
tinction corrections based on the infrared dust maps of Schlaﬂy &
Finkbeiner (2011), and K-corrections from our spectra. Also shown
for comparison are the ugriz light curves of PTF12dam. The two
SLSNe show a similar decline rate at late times, but SN 2015bn has
a shallower rise, and an initially steeper decline around maximum.

(see section 8), but also reasonable since we do not see any
strong Na I D absorption from the host, which is generally
thought to correlate strongly with dust extinction (Poznan-
ski et al. 2012). K-corrections were calculated in the optical
and NIR by comparing synthetic photometry on our spectra
(section 4) in the observer and rest frames. This was facili-
tated by the K-correction code SNAKE (C. Inserra, in prepara-
tion). At this redshift, the size of the correction was typically
(cid:46) 0.2 mag. In the NUV, where we have no spectroscopic cov-
erage, the correction was estimated (Chomiuk et al. 2011) as
KUV = −2.5log10(1 + z) = −0.12 mag.

SN 2015bn has Mg = −22.0 mag (AB) and MU =
−23.07 mag (Vega) at maximum light, making it compara-
ble to some of the most luminous SLSNe I (Vreeswijk et al.
2014; Nicholl et al. 2015b). However, this is about 1.5 mag
fainter than ASASSN-15lh, the brightest known SN (Dong
et al. 2016). The rest-frame optical light curves are shown in
Figure 4. Overlaid for comparison is another well-observed,
low-redshift SLSN I: PTF12dam (Nicholl et al. 2013). The
late-time decline rate is similar between these two objects,
but the light curves do have a number of differences. Most
obvious is the slower rise exhibited by SN 2015bn, where the
broad peak looks more symmetrical around maximum. SN
2015bn is also brighter than PTF12dam by ≈ 0.5 mag in the
red ﬁlters, but the peak luminosities match in u band. Thus
SN 2015bn is brighter but redder than PTF12dam. How-
ever, after ∼ 100 d from peak, SN 2015bn is brighter in the
g-band (PTF12dam was not observed in u-band at this epoch),
demonstrating a very slow colour evolution.

The slow colour evolution is shown explicitly in Figure 5,
and compared to other SLSNe. The colour at peak is sim-

nomials. The V -band points from ASAS-SN suggest a steeper rise
than the early R-band detection by CSS. The implied colour at the
earliest epoch – V − r ≈ 1 mag – would be much redder, and the
evolution much steeper, than other SLSNe at early times. Bottom:

two ﬁlters with the best early sampling: r- and V -bands. We
ﬁtted a third-order polynomial (top panel) to each light curve.
While either band alone would be insufﬁcient to test for the
presence of a bump, the two bands together show that if we
were to assume a smooth rise, we would derive a very surpris-
ing colour evolution. The V -band data clearly show a steeper
decline than that implied by a smooth ﬁt to r-band. The V − r
colour between −30 d and peak is constant at −0.15 mag, but
the ﬁts suggest the colour at early times would be more like
V − r ≈ 1 mag. Such a dramatic change in colour over the
rising phase (and such a red colour at early times) is highly
inconsistent with other SLSNe I that have multicolour data
available at this phase (Leloudas et al. 2012; Howell et al.
2013; Inserra et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2016). Such objects
generally show blue colours, similar to what we see around
the light curve peak here, and a ﬂat colour evolution before
maximum. By contrast, if we assume that the colour evo-
lution is relatively ﬂat, as in other SLSNe I, and combine our
V - and r-band data into a single light curve using the observed
colour at peak, we ﬁnd that the rising light curve of LSQ14bdq
(Nicholl et al. 2015a) gives an excellent match to the data, af-
ter applying a temporal stretch factor of 1.2 (bottom panel).
Thus the multicolour data seem to be more consistent with a
bump similar to LSQ14bdq and other SLSNe I observed at
very early times. However, we note that this is a larger stretch

objects with slowly declining light curves remain bluer for
much longer than their fast-declining counterparts. Interest-
ingly, SN 2011ke, which settled onto a slow light curve tail
after around 50 d from maximum light, has a comparable g−r
colour to the slowly declining objects at 200 d. The u − g
colour of SN 2015bn initially evolves to the blue, reaching
a minimum of ∼ −0.1 mag at maximum light, before declin-
ing relatively steeply compared to the optical-only colours.
The faster decline in the UV is expected as the SN cools. Op-
tical colours are roughly constant from our ﬁrst observations
at −25 d until shortly after peak, with g − r ≈ r − i ≈ i − z ≈
−0.2 mag. The optical colours then slowly evolve to the red,
before settling onto a plateau at times later than about 100 d.
For example, g − r ≈ 0 mag from +90 until +250 d. This evo-
lution is slower and bluer than any literature SLSN with such
late observations, as is seen in the bottom panel of Figure 5,
and from the g-band excess compared to PTF12dam in Figure
4.

The residuals are shown in Figure 7. The excess is more pro-
nounced in the blue and UV bands. This temporary evolution
to the blue can also be seen in Figure 5, where the u−g colour
evolves from ∼ 0.6 mag at +30 d, to ∼ 0.4 mag at +50 d. A
third undulation may occur at +100 d. This is quite promi-
nent in g-band, but the UV light curves are not well sampled
at this epoch. This type of behaviour – a temporary late-time
re-brightening, more pronounced in the blue – has been seen
before in one other SLSN, SSS120810 (Nicholl et al. 2014).
SN 2007bi also seemed to exhibited a bump at ≈ 100 d after
maximum, but no colour information is available at this phase
(Gal-Yam et al. 2009). The implications of these ﬂuctuations
will be discussed in sections 5 and 6.

4. SPECTROSCOPY

4.1. Spectroscopic reductions

Optical spectra of SN 2015bn were acquired using the
NTT and EFOSC2, the 6.5-m Magellan telescopes with the
IMACS and LDSS3 spectrographs, WiFeS on the Australian
National University 2.3-m telescope (Dopita et al. 2007),
LT with SPRAT, the 2.0-m LCOGT Faulkes Telescopes and
FLOYDS, and the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope with
SNIFS. All spectra were reduced, including de-biasing, ﬂat-
ﬁelding, object extraction, wavelength and ﬂux calibration,
using instrument-speciﬁc pipelines or standard routines in
IRAF. The relative ﬂux calibrations were achieved using stan-
dard star observations taken on the same nights as the SN
spectra. Details of the complete list of spectroscopic obser-
vations are given in the Appendix. NIR spectra were obtained
using SOFI on the NTT, and reduced using the PESSTO
pipeline to ﬂat-ﬁeld, sky-subtract and co-add the frames, ap-
ply wavelength calibration to the 2D frames, as well as a ﬂux
calibration and telluric correction from standard star obser-
vations, and ﬁnally to extract the 1D spectrum. For every
spectrum, the absolute ﬂux calibration was checked against
contemporaneous multicolour photometry; spectra were then
scaled to match the photometry if necessary. PESSTO raw
data are immediately available in the ESO archive6, and the
reduced data for the season in which SN 2015bn was observed
are due for bulk public release in late 20167. In the meantime,
all spectra are available on WISeREP.

4.2. Spectroscopic evolution

The complete set of optical spectra are shown chronolog-
ically in Figure 8. SN 2015bn retains a blue continuum
throughout the observing season, and this is still present as
late as 240 d after maximum light, i.e. the ejecta are not yet
fully nebular. The lines in the spectrum also evolve very
slowly. To show more clearly how the individual lines evolve,
and to identify the ions responsible, we normalized each spec-
trum by dividing by its mean ﬂux, and ﬁtted the continuum

than was required for any of the objects in Nicholl & Smartt
(2016).

At later phases, our high-cadence photometry reveals the
presence of more distinctive bumps/plateaus in the light curve,
most prominent in the UV bands. The u-band shows a plateau
lasting 14 d in the rest-frame, until 10 d before maximum light
(Figures 2 and 4). This shows up clearly as a dip in the
UVOT uvm2 light curve, which has an effective wavelength
∼ 2230 Å in the observer frame, or ∼ 2000 Å at the redshift
of SN 2015bn. We designate this feature ‘the shoulder’ for all
subsequent discussion. A second undulation is present in all
optical and UV ﬁlters at 50 rest-frame days after maximum
light, or MJD 57158 – we call this ‘the knee’. To see this
more clearly, we ﬁtted third-order polynomials to the rest-
frame light curve decline in each UV and optical ﬁlter (af-
ter masking epochs between +40 and +60 d), and subtracted
the ﬁt from the full declining light curve. Unfortunately, the
NIR cadence is too sparse to show if the knee exists there too.

Plotting the normalized, continuum-subtracted spectra in Fig-
ure 9, we can see directly how the line centres, velocities and
strengths evolve with time.

The line identiﬁcations in this section were made through
detailed comparison with identiﬁcations and SYNOW ﬁts
(Thomas et al. 2011) given for other SLSNe I by Gal-Yam
et al. (2009); Young et al. (2010); Pastorello et al. (2010);
Quimby et al. (2011); Chomiuk et al. (2011); Leloudas et al.
(2012); Inserra et al. (2013); Lunnan et al. (2013); Nicholl

et al. (2013, 2014). Furthermore, we examined similar mod-
elling of normal Type Ic SN spectra by Millard et al. (1999);
Sauer et al. (2006); Valenti et al. (2008); Hunter et al. (2009).
Line wavelengths in the rest frame were determined by con-
sulting the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (Kramida et al.
2015), and compared to absorption lines assuming a photo-
spheric velocity of 8000 km s−1 (see section 4.3). For the
most common ions, multiple lines of the same species were
checked for consistency using the interactive plotting func-
tionality of WISeREP (Yaron & Gal-Yam 2012). A full set of

Figure 9. Normalized and continuum-subtracted spectra of SN 2015bn. Line identiﬁcations are labeled using the following convention: ab-
sorption components are marked in dark red assuming a velocity of 8000 km s−1; emission lines are marked in black assuming they are centred
on zero velocity; host emission is marked in green; uncertain identiﬁcations are marked in grey. Subplots contain zooms to various parts of
the spectrum to show line evolution. Little spectroscopic evolution occurs from −27 d to +7 d; the spectrum then undergoes something of a
transformation at some time between +7 d and +20 d; the spectrum beyond 20-30 d evolves very slowly once again.

self-consistent models to reproduce the spectral evolution of
SN 2015bn will be the subject of future work, but is beyond
the scope of this paper. In the discussion below, we use the
symbol λ when referring to lines by their rest-frame wave-
length, and Å when referring to redshifted absorption.

It is immediately clear from Figures 8 and 9 that the spec-
tra divide fairly cleanly into two phases. Very little evolution
is seen from our ﬁrst spectrum at −27 d through to +7 d. Our
highest signal-to-noise spectra taken over this period are over-
laid in Figure 9 (purple to dark green lines). Between +7 and
+20 d, the spectrum undergoes something of a transformation,
after which it evolves very slowly for the next 200 d. Sample
spectra from this second phase are also overlaid in the ﬁgure
(light green to red lines). This is an important result, which is
independent of any model or line identiﬁcations.
The early (t ≤ 7 d) spectra are dominated by blue contin-
uum emission, superimposed with fairly weak, broad absorp-
tion features and P Cygni lines. In the blue, we clearly see
the O II absorption lines that have come to characterise the

SLSN I class; however, in this case the absorption at 4300 Å is
stronger and broader than the other lines. This could indicate
a contribution from Fe III λ4430. Between 3000-3600 Å, we
detect absorptions that have been attributed to Fe III and Si III
in other SLSNe I (e.g. Leloudas et al. 2012; Lunnan et al.
2013). Moving to redder wavelengths, we see signatures of
Fe II at ∼ 5000-6000 Å, along with Na I D and Si II λ6355. We
tentatively associate the feature at ∼ 7000 Å with C II λ7234.
To the red of this we see a fairly strong O I λ7774, which may
include some contribution from a Mg II line of similar wave-
length.

Interestingly, we may also see some spectroscopic indica-
tion of hydrogen at early times. Yan et al. (2015) presented
an Hα emission line in the nebular spectrum of iPTF13ehe,
caused by late-time interaction with hydrogen-rich material at
a large radius, but no hydrogen was seen in the photospheric
phase. The upper right panel of Figure 9 includes the region
around Hα (rest-wavelength 6563 Å). There is an absorption
in the earliest spectrum at 6300 Å, which is consistent with

dence of this claim.

If hydrogen is present in the spectrum of SN 2015bn, in-
dicating that some small amount of the progenitor’s envelope
managed to remain bound before explosion, we might also
expect to see some helium (though this is much more difﬁ-
cult to excite). While the strongest optical He I line is gener-
ally hard to distinguish from the Na I D lines, our NIR spec-
tra (Figure 11) show a clear line at ≈ 10800 Å that could be
He I λ10830. This line is expected to be 2-10 times stronger
than the strongest optical line of He I (Inserra et al. 2013).
Few NIR spectra of SLSNe I exist, but Inserra et al. (2013)
saw a similar feature in SN 2012il. Normal SNe Ic generally
exhibit P Cygni lines with a deep absorption component at this
wavelength. However, the identiﬁcation of this line has been
hotly debated in the literature. (Patat et al. 2001) claimed a
detection of He in the NIR spectrum of the LGRB-associated
Type Ic SN 1998bw, but this has been challenged by Tauben-
berger et al. (2006); Hachinger (2011). It has been argued that
this line may contain a large contribution from C I, since the
other strong helium line in the NIR (∼ 2.1 µm) tends to be
weak or absent in SNe Ic, unlike in He-rich SNe Ib (Hunter
et al. 2009). Unfortunately, our wavelength coverage does not
extend to 2 µm for SN 2015bn. While the line could plausibly
be He I, a ﬁrm identiﬁcation is not possible. The presence of
carbon in the optical spectrum may suggest that C I is a more
likely explanation for this feature. Other species that could
contribute at this wavelength are Mg II and Si II. Future spec-
tral modelling will be required to determine the nature of the
10800 Å line.

Returning from our digression to the NIR, we now examine
the optical evolution after maximum light. Looking again at
Figure 9, the most obvious changes occurring between 7 and
20 d after maximum are the emergence of Mg I] λ4571 emis-

Figure 10. Close-ups of the early spectra of SN 2015bn around the
wavelengths of Hα and Hβ. Thick lines show the rest-frame loca-
tions of lines in velocity space, while thin lines show the same lines
redshifted by 8000 km s−1 from their rest wavelengths. The earliest
spectra show possible absorptions due to hydrogen, which disappear
before maximum light. However, the origin of these lines is not to-
tally certain, due to blending with blueshifted C II and Fe II.

Hα at a velocity ≈ 8000 km s−1. However, an alternative iden-
tiﬁcation for this line is C II λ6580, particularly if the line at
7000 Å during this phase is also carbon. On the other hand,
the absorption at 6300 Å vanishes by the time of maximum,
light, whereas the 7000 Å line persists.

In a further attempt to break the degeneracy, we look more
closely at the region around Hα and Hβ (in velocity space)
in Figure 10. The strongest line in the vicinity of Hβ is
Fe II λ4924, which was identiﬁed for SN 2007bi by Gal-Yam
et al. (2009); Young et al. (2010), and is consistent with a
SYNOW ﬁt to LSQ12dlf by Nicholl et al. (2014). The ini-
tial blueshift of the P Cygni peak may indicate that the line
is at ﬁrst blended with Hβ; this blueshift quickly disappears
along with Hα. There is also an absorption in the earliest
spectrum located at ≈ 8000 km s−1 bluewards of Hβ. How-
ever, the effects of line blending make a ﬁrm association with
Hβ difﬁcult. Overall, we consider it plausible, though by
no means certain, that these lines are from unburned hydro-
gen. Parrent et al. (2015) showed that the line proﬁles around
6200-6500 Å in superluminous and normal Type Ic SNe may
be better reproduced by including hydrogen as well as Si II.
Although their analysis was based on a SLSN spectrum well
after maximum light, the resolved absorption features in the
early spectrum of SN 2015bn may provide independent evi-

spectrum evolves. We measured the photospheric velocity as
a function of time using a number of ions by ﬁtting Gaussian
proﬁles to each line and determining the blueshift of the ab-
sorption minima. It is common to use the Fe II λ5169 line to
measure photospheric velocities (e.g. Nicholl et al. 2015b).
However, in SN 2015bn this line seems to be blended with
Fe III at early times. Moreover, our densely sampled spectra,
spanning ∼ 200 d in the rest-frame, shows that the peak of
the P Cygni proﬁle moves signiﬁcantly to the red as the spec-
trum evolves, such that we cannot be conﬁdent that the same
line dominates the absorption at late times. To get the most
consistent velocity measurements, we choose lines that ap-
pear to be unblended for the majority of spectra. The smooth
evolution towards lower velocity is particularly clear for the
Si II λ6355 and O I λ7774 lines, so we used these two lines,
along with Fe II λ4924, to measure the photospheric velocity
of SN 2015bn.

The velocity measurements are shown in Figure 12, and
compared with other SLSNe (using the same lines). We per-
formed the measurements ourselves for PTF12dam and SN
2010gx, whereas the velocities for SNe 2007bi and 2011ke
were taken from Young et al. (2010) and Inserra et al. (2013)
respectively. All of the ions indicate relatively lower veloc-
ities in SN 2015bn: ≈ 8000 km s−1 at maximum light com-
pared to 9000-12000 km s−1 in the other objects. Nicholl
et al. (2015b) estimated a median maximum-light velocity of
10500± 3000 km s−1 for SLSNe I, so SN 2015bn falls at the
low-end of the expected range. The O I line shows the highest
velocity, and Fe II the lowest, as we would expect for a sensi-
ble stratiﬁcation of the ejecta, with heavier nuclei towards the
centre. The effect is compounded as the O I line is relatively
strong, such that absorption in the outermost, rariﬁed material
(which has the highest velocity) is still signiﬁcant.
The evolution in the measured velocities as we move to later
phases is very slow, decreasing by only ∼ 3000 km s−1 dur-
ing a period of nearly 150 d, and seemingly staying constant
thereafter. For comparison, the Fe II velocity of the normal
Type Ic SN 2007gr is also shown. Although these SNe show
similar late-time velocity, SN 2007gr underwent a steep de-
celeration around maximum light. The relatively ﬂat velocity
curves of SLSNe I have been interpreted as one possible sig-
nature of a central engine accelerating the inner ejecta (Kasen
& Bildsten 2010; Chomiuk et al. 2011; Nicholl et al. 2015b).
The unprecedented spectroscopic coverage of SN 2015bn –
together with low velocities that reduce some of the effects
of line blending – reveals the clearest indication yet that at
least some SLSNe have very shallow velocity gradients in the
ejecta.

Figure 12. Velocity evolution compared to other SLSNe. Measure-
ments were made by ﬁtting Gaussian curves to absorption minima,
using lines that appeared to be largely unblended throughout the pho-
tospheric evolution. Comparisons with other SLSNe indicate rela-
tively low velocities. The ﬂat velocity curve is markedly different
from the normal Type Ic SN 2007gr. Data sources: Young et al.

sion, strong Fe II lines between 4000-5500 Å, and Na I D ab-
sorption. There is also an unidentiﬁed line at around 6100 Å –
this could perhaps be a detached, high-velocity component of
Si II with a velocity of ∼ 16000 km s−1, but it would be very
surprising for a high-velocity line to appear only at late times.
At the same time, the O II and Fe III lines that previously dom-
inated the blue part of the spectrum weaken and disappear as
the ejecta cool and these species recombine. The P Cygni line
at 7000 Å is replaced by an asymmetrical emission line due to
[Ca II] λλ7291,7323. The [Ca II] shows a steep blue side but
a broad red wing. One explanation for this asymmetry could
be blending with C II or Fe II. At the same time, we start to
see likely emission from [O I] λλ6300,6364 and the Ca II NIR
triplet at 8500 Å. The strengths of the calcium lines, as well
as O I λ7774 and the Na I D absorption, increase substantially
after +50 d. The ﬁnal spectrum obtained at +243 d (and after
SN 2015bn had returned from behind the sun) remains largely
similar, with signiﬁcant continuum persisting in the blue. The
only noticeable change over this period is that some emis-
sion lines (especially calcium) increase in luminosity, and ab-
sorption lines (especially sodium) increase in depth. The later
spectra, with necessarily longer exposure times, ﬁnally reveal
the presence of faint nebular emission lines originating in the
host galaxy, from which we securely derive the redshift of
z = 0.1136.

4.4. Comparisons

The various subplots in Figure 9 show close-ups of different
spectral lines. We can see that the minima of all absorption
lines, as well as the peaks of some P Cygni proﬁles, move
gradually to lower velocities (i.e. redder wavelength) as the

In Figures 13 and 14, we compare our spectra of SN 2015bn
to other SLSNe from the literature. First we consider ob-

Figure 13. Comparison of selected spectra with other slow-fading
SLSNe at similar phases: PTF12dam (Nicholl et al. 2013) and SN
2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009; Young et al. 2010). The spectroscopic
evolution is nearly identical, although SN 2015bn shows Fe III at
∼ 4000 Å at earlier phases than PTF12dam, which shows only O II
at this wavelength at −15 d. SN 2007bi exhibits the same lines at late
times, but the features are more pronounced at ∼ 100 d.

PTF12dam (Nicholl et al. 2013) are some of the best observed
examples. As demonstrated by Figure 13, the spectroscopic
evolution of SN 2015bn is an excellent match to these ob-
jects. In particular, all three objects exhibit a distinctive ‘trio’
of lines between ∼ 5700-6500 Å at late times. However, there
are some interesting differences. SN 2007bi shows stronger
emission lines at ∼ 100 d, especially in Mg I] and [Ca II], sug-
gesting that SN 2007bi develops a signiﬁcant nebular compo-
nent earlier than the other two objects.

SN 2015bn also exhibits a slight difference compared to
PTF12dam at very early times. While the two objects look
virtually identical at peak, the shapes and equivalent widths
of the O II lines at 4000-4600 Å in PTF12dam at −15 d were
very similar to those in fast-declining SLSNe I, whereas in
SN 2015bn these lines are weaker and may be blended with
Fe III λ4430 at the time of our earliest spectra > 20 d before
maximum. Given that the continuum temperature looks vir-
tually identical to PTF12dam, the differences may be due to
velocity structure or composition. That the spectrum of SN
2015bn looks unchanged for longer around maximum light
than PTF12dam is consistent with its shallower rise, and may
be linked to the pre-peak shoulder in the light curve. In sum-
mary, the early detection and high-cadence spectra reveal a
small degree of diversity among these objects, but overall the

Figure 14. Comparison of selected spectra with the more common
fast-evolving SLSNe. Although the objects share all important lines,
SN 2015bn shows a number of differences from these objects:
it
shows stronger absorption above 5000 Å before maximum light,
whereas 2010gx is relatively featureless in this region; lines are no-
ticeably less broad in SN 2015bn, corresponding to lower velocities
(c.f. Figure 12); SN 2015bn retains a very blue continuum for much
longer (c.f. Figure 5). Data from Pastorello et al. (2010); Inserra et al.
(2013); Nicholl et al. (2014).

spectroscopic evolution of SN 2015bn conﬁrms the similar-
ity of this object to PTF12dam and SN 2007bi. Given the
relatively low velocities and high signal-to-noise spectra of
SN 2015bn, this is an ideal dataset for detailed spectroscopic
modelling in the future, to conﬁrm our line identiﬁcations and
explain the slight differences between the SLSNe. However,
such modelling is beyond the scope of this paper.

We now compare and contrast the same sequence of spec-
tra with some typical fast-declining SLSNe I (the same ob-
jects used for the colour comparison in Figure 5). In fact, the
most obvious difference in Figure 14 was already revealed by
Figure 5:
that while most SLSNe I evolve to the red after
maximum light, SN 2015bn (and other slow decliners) main-
tain a strong blue continuum for much longer. The other im-
portant difference is in the line widths; the fast-declining ob-
jects show signiﬁcantly more Doppler-broadening and blend-
ing compared to SN 2015bn, as expected from their higher
velocities (Figure 12). Despite these differences, the slow-
and fast- declining SLSNe I do display nearly all the same
lines, and in the same order – particularly O II before max-
imum light and Ca II, Mg I], Fe II and Si II afterwards – but
the lines only become prominent at later times in objects like

evolution of these events, it is not unreasonable to compare a
fast event at ≈ +50 d with SN 2015bn at ≈ +100 d.
The four objects show all the same major spectral features,
apart from in the region between ∼ 5700-6500 Å, where SN
2015bn shows the distinctive trio of lines. The fast-declining
SLSN does not show Na I D or the unidentiﬁed line at this
phase. We note that SN 2015bn started to exhibit the trio of
lines as early as +50 d, despite the much slower evolution in
all of the lines it shows in common with SSS120810. This
gives us some conﬁdence that this trio may represent a real
spectroscopic difference rather than an artefact of the phases
we choose for the comparison. The GRB-SN 1998bw does
not exhibit the central, unidentiﬁed line of the trio, but agrees
in the other two lines (Si II and Na I). This could be a con-
sequence of line blending due to the higher velocities in this
object. SN 2011bm does show three absorptions within the
shaded region, but apart from Na I, the proﬁles seem to be
redshifted relative to SN 2015bn, and may not actually be
the same lines. The other distinctive difference is in the Ca II
lines. SN 2015bn is the only object that shows a larger lumi-
nosity in the forbidden line at 7300 Å than in the allowed NIR
triplet at 8600 Å. A detailed explanation of these line differ-
ences is beyond the scope of our study, but may hold clues to
whether there are signiﬁcant differences in the ejecta condi-
tions between different stripped SNe. In particular, the strong
[Ca II] emission in all slowly-declining SLSNe has yet to be
understood (Gal-Yam et al. 2009).

5. BOLOMETRIC LIGHT CURVE AND PHYSICAL

PROPERTIES

5.1. Flux integration and blackbody ﬁts

The next step in our analysis was to construct the bolomet-
ric light curve of SN 2015bn. Because the photometric ob-
servations span the full wavelength range from the UV to the
NIR, the bolometric luminosity could be estimated relatively
straightforwardly. After applying reddening corrections and
K-corrections to the measured magnitudes, and correcting for
distance modulus at z = 0.1136, the absolute rest-frame light
curve in each ﬁlter was interpolated to match the epochs with
g- and V -band observations. Magnitudes were then converted
to spectral luminosity (Lλ) to give a spectral energy distribu-
tion (SED) at each point on the light curve. To get the lumi-
nosity, we integrated each SED numerically, assuming ﬂuxes
go to zero at the blue edge of the uvw2 band and the red edge
of K-band.

We also ﬁtted blackbody curves to each SED. As well as
enabling a check that the SED looks sensible, these ﬁts were
used to derive temperatures and radii. In Figure 16, we plot
the SED and blackbody ﬁts at 4 representative epochs: our
earliest epoch with multicolour photometry at −27 d; maxi-
mum light; +30 d, sampling the steeper decline prior to the
knee; and +75 d, sampling the slower post-knee decline. At
early times (top row of ﬁgure), the blackbody ﬁts are poor

Figure 15. Comparison of late-phase spectra of SLSNe and other
SNe Ic. All spectra have been corrected for extinction. Objects
are plotted in order of increasing line velocities (top to bottom).
The spectrum of SN 2011bm has been de-reddened by an additional
E(B − V ) = 0.4 for ease of comparison. The four objects show all
the same major spectral features (marked on the plot), apart from
in the shaded blue area between ∼ 5700-6500 Å, where SN 2015bn
shows a distinctive trio of lines. The vertical lines mark the rest-
frame wavelengths of the transitions labelled. The region between
3000-4000 Å is likely also affected by absorption due to Mg II, Ti II
and Fe-group elements (e.g. Millard et al. 1999). Data from Patat
et al. (2001); Valenti et al. (2012); Nicholl et al. (2014).

SN 2015bn, in keeping with their slower photometric evolu-
tion. This degree of similarity clearly suggests a link between
the fast and slow SLSNe I. Higher ejecta mass could simul-
taneously explain the broader light curve, lower velocity, and
later formation of lines in the slow objects like SN 2015bn.
In order to account for the persistent blue continuum, more
late-time heating may be required.

The literature contains numerous comparisons between the
early (photospheric) spectra of SLSNe I and of normal and
broad-lined SNe Ic (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2010; Inserra et al.
2013). Given the high signal-to-noise late-time spectra of SN
2015bn, we now have an opportunity to do a similar com-
parison at late times, when the objects are evolving towards
the nebular phase. A full nebular comparison is not possible
yet, as SN 2015bn retains signiﬁcant continuum and absorp-
tion lines even at +243 d. In Figure 15, we plot the +106 d
spectrum of SN 2015bn along with the spectroscopically nor-
mal (but high mass) Type Ic SN 2011bm (Valenti et al. 2012)
and the broad-lined, LGRB-associated Type Ic SN 1998bw
(Patat et al. 2001) at comparable phases. We also show the
spectrum of the fast-declining SLSN I SSS120810 at +44 d.
Unfortunately, no high signal-to-noise spectra of this kind of
event is available beyond ≈ +50 d, as high redshifts make ob-
servations of fast-declining SLSNe challenging at this phase.
A later spectrum of SSS120810 at +60 d does exist (Nicholl
et al. 2014) and looks virtually identical to this one, but we
use the earlier spectrum as it has a much higher signal-to-
noise ratio. Given the faster spectroscopic (and photometric)

UV (bluewards of u-band), optical (u- to z-band) and NIR (redwards

around the peak of the SED. This has been observed before
(e.g. Chomiuk et al. 2011), and is a consequence of metal
line absorption in the UV, which signiﬁcantly suppresses the
ﬂux bluewards of ∼ 3000 Å. Therefore we also ﬁtted a ‘two-
temperature’ blackbody model, using two components that
meet at the u-band. These curves (shown in Figure 16) are not
intended to suggest two physically distinct temperature zones,
but simply to demonstrate the very different colour tempera-
ture in the UV due to the strong absorption. The red compo-
nent (u- to K-band), is not subject to substantial line block-
ing, and should thus give a better overall representation of
the colour temperature of the underlying continuum emission.
The amount of line absorption increases with time across the
UV and optical (Figure 9). However, as the ejecta cool and
the peak of the SED moves into the optical, we ﬁnd that by
∼ 75 d the SED can be described well by a single blackbody
ﬁt from the UV to the NIR. At all epochs, integrating the two-
component blackbody model from 1000-25000 Å gives a lu-
minosity estimate that is consistent (to within < 5%) with that
obtained by directly integrating the observed ﬂuxes.

In the UV and optical ﬁlters, our photometric sampling is
sufﬁcient that linear interpolation between epochs was gen-
erally only over periods of a few days, and therefore does
not wash out the substructure in the light curve (shoulder and
knee; see section 3). The NIR is not sampled quite so densely,

but this is not problematic, as the NIR contribution to the over-
all ﬂux is relatively modest. As demonstrated by Figure 16,
at maximum light the NIR contribution is (cid:46) 10%, rising to
∼ 20% during the decline phase. Since we lack NIR observa-
tions earlier than −9 d, we assumed constant colours in g − J,
g − H and g − K for the early points. The blackbody ﬁt in
the ﬁrst panel of Figure 16 shows that this is a reasonable as-
sumption. At the very earliest epochs, we have only a single
ﬁlter – in this case we assumed the same bolometric correc-
tion as at −27 d. This assumption should be perfectly reason-
able for small extrapolations, but is questionable for the ear-
liest CRTS point – for example, Nicholl & Smartt (2016) and
Smith et al. (2016) found temperatures ≈ 25000 K during the
early bump phases of SLSNe, compared to temperatures of
10000-15000 K at maximum light. For our latest photometric
point at +243 d, we lack UV data. The bolometric luminosity
here was estimated by integrating a one-temperature black-
body ﬁt to the optical and NIR data.

5.2. Luminosity, temperature and radius

The bolometric light curve, as well as the temperatures and
radii inferred from the blackbody ﬁts, are plotted in Figure
17. We divide the evolution into ﬁve phases for our analy-
sis; these are labelled a, b, c, d and e in the ﬁgure. In region
a, the evolution is only partially observed. We have an iso-
lated point at −79 d with a large error due to the reliance on
an uncertain bolometric correction. At this phase, the point
could be part of a long smooth rise, but our analysis in section
3 suggested that it was more likely to be connected with the
initial bump phase exhibited shortly after explosion by many
SLSNe I (Leloudas et al. 2012; Nicholl et al. 2015a; Nicholl
& Smartt 2016; Smith et al. 2016). When we pick up the ob-
ject again with ASAS-SN, it is −54 d from peak and rising. As
we only have single-ﬁlter photometry at this time, we have no
information about the temperature or radius during region a.
Region b encompasses the pre-maximum shoulder, ﬁrst
pointed out in section 3. This lasts for around 12 d, and seems
to be a ﬂat plateau in bolometric space. The blackbody tem-
perature decreases from ∼ 12000 K to ∼ 11000 K during this
phase (based on optical-NIR blackbody ﬁt). This drop is com-
pensated by an increase in the radius of the emitting surface.
The change in radius over time during this phase is consistent
with our measured velocities in Figure 12 – these curves are
overplotted here. If we extrapolate the O I velocity backwards
to RBB = 0 (assuming a deceleration of 26 km s−1 d−1, based
on the velocity evolution shown in Figure 12), we arrive at an
explosion date 92 d before maximum light. However, as the
ejecta will likely have undergone steeper deceleration at early
times, the 92 d rise should be considered an upper limit only.
If the explosion occurred < 92 d before peak, then the detec-
tion at −78 d would most likely be during the initial bump
phase, assuming SN 2015bn follows a similar morphology to
LSQ14bdq. This agrees with our analysis in section 3.

The next phase of the light curve, labelled c, is the broad,

stops tracking the measured line velocities, and begins to de-
crease from its maximum value of 1016 cm, indicating that
the photosphere is receding through the ejecta faster than the
ejecta are expanding. Up to this point, the measured velocities
were slowly decreasing, but during region d they settle onto
a constant ∼ 6500 km s−1 (see also Figure 12). This suggests
a change in the ejecta structure, with a ﬂatter velocity proﬁle
inside some mass coordinate. This will be discussed in more
detail in section 6.5.

Finally, in region e the bolometric luminosity settles onto
a long, slow decline, which we followed for 60 d before SN
2015bn disappeared behind the sun. Since its return just be-
fore the end of 2015, our observations are consistent with the
same slow decline rate, as demonstrated by a linear ﬁt across
this part of the light curve. The temperature is approximately
constant at 7000 K. Meanwhile the radius looks to have de-
creased slowly and smoothly to ∼ 4× 1015 cm. During this
phase, the blackbody ﬁts to the full UV-NIR wavelength range
give much the same colour temperature as the optical-NIR
ﬁts; this is expected given Figure 16. The total radiative out-
put integrated across regions a-e is Erad = 2.1× 1051 erg.

5.3. Bolometric comparisons

In Figure 18, we compare the bolometric light curve of
SN 2015bn to other SLSNe I. The late-time decline rate of
SN 2015bn is a near-perfect match for PTF12dam and SN
2007bi. The fast-declining SLSN 2011ke transitioned to a
tail phase after around 50 d, which also matches this slope
(though not all SLSNe seem to show this behaviour). The
decline rate is suspiciously similar to the decay of 56Co; this
will be discussed in more detail in section 6. Looking more
closely at the light curve shape around peak, SN 2015bn
does show a marked difference from other slow-declining
SLSNe I observed so far. PTF12dam and SN 2007bi ap-
pear to begin their slow-declining tail phase immediately af-
ter maximum light, whereas SN 2015bn initially shows a
steeper decline more reminiscent of faster SLSNe. The mea-
sured bolometric decline rate between days +10 and +30 is
0.038 mag d−1, which is almost identical to LSQ12dlf around
the same phase, whereas PTF12dam declines at a rate of only
0.011 mag d−1. The initially faster decline rate may indicate
a lower mass compared to PTF12dam; however, the rise time
may be longer, and argues in the opposite direction. Mass
estimates from model ﬁts will be presented in section 6.

While on the subject of the rise time, another useful com-
parison can be made to PTF12dam if we assume that the ear-
liest detection of each event is close to the time of explosion;
this is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 18. In this case, the
time to peak of PTF12dam matches the time to the shoulder in
SN 2015bn. The discrepancies between the light curves then
appear between ∼ 60-140 d after explosion, as SN 2015bn
undergoes a number of undulations of decreasing amplitude
(there is potentially a third, weak undulation around 150 d),
before joining smoothly onto a tail phase that again matches

smooth peak. Over 15 d, SN 2015bn rises to a bolometric
maximum with Lpeak = 2.3× 1044 erg s−1. The light curve is
quite symmetric close to maximum, then settles onto a smooth
decline until ∼ 30 d later. The luminosity closely tracks
the temperature evolution, which shows an increase back to
12000 K at maximum and then declines smoothly afterwards.
The radius largely continues to track the line velocities, in-
dicating that photospheric recession is relatively unimportant
during this phase. Therefore the changes in the spectrum oc-
curring a few weeks after maximum light are primarily driven
by the decrease in temperature. That the spectrum shows so
little evolution prior to this can also be understood in terms of
the temperature evolution, which varies by only around 10%
from our ﬁrst measurement until ∼ 15 d after maximum.
The most interesting behaviour occurs at (cid:38) 30 d. This is the
beginning of the knee in the light curve, which we designate
region d. The blue excess visible in Figure 7 shows up clearly
as a brief plateau in the bolometric output, during which time
the temperature stays constant at around 8500 K. The radius

fast decline) has a very similar slope. The slope is approximately
consistent with fully-trapped cobalt decay. Inset: The shape of the

solute bolometric maximum). Data sources: Pastorello et al. (2010);

PTF12dam. This shows that, without a clear picture of the
physical mechanism underlying the light curve undulations,
it is difﬁcult to know which phases are most appropriate to
make like-for-like comparisons between the SNe. That the
spectrum of SN 2015bn during the shoulder phase looks like
PTF12dam at maximum light may indicate that this alignment
gives a fairer comparison than the ‘days-from-peak’ approach
used elsewhere in this work. Fortunately, this is not crucial
for the analysis to follow.

6. PHYSICAL MODELS

6.1. Light curve ﬁts

To better understand the nature of SN 2015bn, we ﬁtted the
bolometric light curve with diffusion models based on the var-
ious power sources proposed for SLSNe: a magnetar engine;
circumstellar interaction; and radioactive decay. The neces-

sary equations and ﬁtting procedures have been extensively
described by Inserra et al. (2013); Chatzopoulos et al. (2012);
Nicholl et al. (2014), and are based on the original diffusion
solution of Arnett (1982) with constant opacity. There is a
degree of uncertainty as to what value to use for the opacity
when modelling SLSNe. In the optical, the dominant source
of opacity is electron scattering. For normal SNe Ic, most
authors assume κ = 0.1 cm2 g−1. In the case of SLSNe, ion-
ization may be more complete, especially before and around
maximum when the temperature is higher than in normal SNe
Ic; full ionization gives κ = 0.2 cm2 g−1. In the present work
we will assume this latter value. For ﬁxed kinetic energy,
the value of Mej derived from ﬁtting the light curve scales as
Mej ∝ κ−2/3. Therefore our ejecta mass estimates can easily
be compared with literature models that use κ = 0.1 cm2 g−1
simply by multiplying them by a factor of 1.6.

6.2. Magnetar models

We ﬁrst consider models in which the luminosity is pow-
ered by magnetar spin-down. This is a speciﬁc example of
the more general class of ‘central engine’ models, which also
include accretion-powered SNe (Dexter & Kasen 2013). The
magnetar model assumes that the core-collapse of the SLSN
progenitor leaves behind a highly magnetised neutron star
(B ∼ 1014 G) rotating with a period P ∼ 1−10 ms. The nascent
pulsar thus has a large reservoir of rotational energy, which
is tapped via the B-ﬁeld and heats the ejecta at the rate pre-
scribed by the standard magnetic dipole formula (Ostriker &
Gunn 1971; Kasen & Bildsten 2010; Woosley 2010). The
magnetar emission is expected to be in the form of energetic
electron-positron pairs, which generate a hard input spectrum
through a pair-cascade (Metzger et al. 2014). We treat γ-ray
leakage from the ejecta following Wang et al. (2015) (see also
Chen et al. 2015).

As discussed in sections 3 and 5, because the early light
curve is not well sampled, we do not know for sure whether
SN 2015bn rises monotonically from discovery to maximum
light, or if the ﬁrst detection is during the initial bump phase
that seems to be common in SLSNe I (Nicholl & Smartt
2016). The colour evolution suggested that the bump inter-
pretation is more likely (see section 3). The basic form of
the magnetar model employed here does not accommodate
a non-monotonic rise (though Kasen et al. 2015 have shown
that including delayed shock breakout driven by the magne-
tar can give a good ﬁt to the double-peaked light curve of
LSQ14bdq). Nicholl et al. (2015b) showed that, for both
magnetar models and observed SLSNe, the rise and decline
timescales obey a fairly tight correlation. Thus the nature of
the ﬁrst detection, driving the ﬁt at early times, will have a
strong inﬂuence on the ﬁt at peak, and therefore any derived
parameters. For this reason, we calculated the best-ﬁtting
model under two different constraints: including the ﬁrst point
as part of a smooth rise; and introducing a synthetic point
around where we would expect the monotonic rise to begin if

the ﬁrst detection is in the bump phase – we do this by scaling
the light curve of LSQ14bdq as in Figure 2.

The model ﬁts are shown in Figure 19, with the ﬁt parame-
ters listed in Table 1. In general, the ﬁts are seen to be reason-
able; however these simple models are not able to replicate the
detailed structure in terms of the knee and shoulder. The value
of the derived mass is driven by two competing factors. The
relatively narrow shape around the main light curve peak can
be more easily ﬁt with a lower-mass model, while the overall
broader shape and long rise favours higher mass. If we as-
sume a smooth rise, the best-ﬁt ejecta mass is 13.0 M(cid:12). The

slow tail phase is well-matched due to a long spin-down time,
given by the relatively weak B-ﬁeld (Kasen & Bildsten 2010;
Nicholl et al. 2013). This model gives a fairly good match
to the temperature and velocity evolution, especially the slow
velocity decline at late times. On the other hand, the broad
luminosity peak in this case is a rather poor ﬁt to the data.

If we instead assume that the ﬁrst point is part of the bump
phase, we get a more convincing ﬁt between −50 d and maxi-
mum, with a lower ejecta mass of Mej ≈ 8.4 M(cid:12). The model
still peaks a little earlier than the data, which is interesting in
light of the comparison to PTF12dam in the lower panel of
Figure 18. This model gives an excellent match to the pho-
tospheric velocity, and to the temperature evolution prior to
the light curve knee (the other magnetar ﬁts also reproduced
the temperature and velocity reasonably well). The fact that
the better overall ﬁt to the light curve, temperature and veloc-
ity is the one for which we assume an initial bump phase is
intriguing.

However, inspection of Table 2 shows that this model has a
total rise time of 66 d, seemingly in contradiction to the pre-
sumed bump detection at −79 d. The widths of the bumps may
be 10-15 days (Nicholl et al. 2015a; Nicholl & Smartt 2016),
which could then imply a discrepancy between the explosion
time and the magnetar ﬁt of up to 20-25 d. There are two
possibilities. The ﬁrst is that this is a real inconsistency, and
the magnetar ﬁt must be ﬁxed with an explosion time at the
ﬁrst detection at the latest (i.e. our ‘slow rising’ model). The
second is that thermalisation of the magnetar wind energy in
the ejecta is not 100% efﬁcient from the time of explosion.
Our model does naively assume that the magnetar energy in-
put is 100% efﬁcient but this is by no means certain. The
detailed physical processes by which the energy is emitted
and thermalised are not yet well understood (Metzger et al.
2015; Kasen et al. 2015). Therefore there could be a delay
between core-collapse and the onset of efﬁcient energy trans-
fer between the magnetar and the expanding ejecta. Given
these uncertainties, we conclude that a magnetar spin-down
model with relatively high ejecta mass and low B-ﬁeld is a
good candidate to explain the properties of SN 2015bn.

6.3. Interaction models

Next we investigate models powered by a collision between
the fast SN ejecta and dense CSM. In this context, the ob-
served luminosity comes from reprocessing and thermalisa-
tion of the kinetic energy by a forward shock wave propagat-
ing in the CSM and a reverse shock in the ejecta. For the en-
ergy conversion to be efﬁcient, in general the mass contained
in the CSM must be an appreciable fraction of that ejected by
the explosion – i.e. at least a few solar masses (Chatzopoulos
et al. 2013; Nicholl et al. 2014; Inserra et al. 2015). The pro-
genitors of interacting SLSNe would thus require exception-
ally high mass-loss rates, perhaps as much as 0.1-1 M(cid:12) yr−1
(e.g. Benetti et al. 2014). This is difﬁcult to achieve via
stellar winds, and could instead point towards large discrete

mass ejections, such as the eruptions of luminous blue vari-
ables (Justham et al. 2014) or hypothetical pulsational-PISNe
(Woosley et al. 2007). Thus the expected CSM density pro-
ﬁle around the star is quite uncertain. Following Chatzopou-
los et al. (2012), we calculate models with two representa-
tive density proﬁles: ρCSM ∝ r−2, as expected for a wind; and
ρCSM = constant, which may be more appropriate for a CSM
‘shell’ from a discrete mass ejection. Because the interaction
model has signiﬁcantly more free parameters than the mag-
netar models, there is no tight relationship between the rise
and decline rates (Nicholl et al. 2015b). Therefore it is not
so important in this case how we treat the ﬁrst detection of
SN 2015bn at −79 d; typically, increasing the ejecta or CSM
mass can extend the rise time sufﬁciently to include this point
as desired, without signiﬁcantly altering the shape during the
decline phase. For each density proﬁle, we calculate a slow-
and fast-rising model to demonstrate this (see ﬁt parameters
in Table 2).

The ﬁts are shown in Figure 20.

In the top panel we
plot models with uniform shells of CSM. We ﬁt for Mej,
MCSM, ρCSM, the radius of the ejecta-CSM interface and ki-
netic energy (Ek). We note that the radius, Rint, is only
weakly constrained by the light curve ﬁtting routine, but can
be checked against the observed temperature evolution8 (bot-
tom panel). The best-ﬁt slow-and fast rising shell models
both have MCSM ≈ 18 M(cid:12) and Ek ≈ 2 × 1051 erg. The ratio
Mej/MCSM is of order unity for the model with the slow rise,
while the faster rising model has Mej/MCSM = 2.7. These are
fairly similar to the ratios found by Nicholl et al. (2014) for
a number of other SLSNe I. However, these curves are un-
able to reproduce the transition to the shallower decline rate
after 60 d. By maximum light, the forward and reverse shocks
have ﬁnished traversing the CSM and ejecta, respectively, and
therefore no further energy can be deposited. The light curves
therefore decline exponentially from peak as the stored energy
diffuses out.

The middle panel shows models using the wind density pro-
ﬁle. In general, the wind scenario favours similar or slightly
lower Mej and MCSM compared to the shell models, with
Mej = 25 M(cid:12) giving a good ﬁt along with MCSM = 15-20 M(cid:12) to
cover the range of possible rise times. The kinetic energy in

the wind model is 4 × 1051 erg. The wind models are more
sensitive to the interaction radius, Rint, compared to the shell
models. For the inferred radii of ≈ 3× 1014 cm, a wind speed
of 10 km s−1 would imply that the mass loss occurred over a
period of 10-200 d before explosion. However, these mod-
els suffer from the same problem at late times as do the shell
models, in that they decline too quickly. Comparing the tem-
perature evolution of each model (bottom panel), we ﬁnd that
both the wind and shell models give a reasonable match to
observations, with the slow rising models predicting cooler

temperatures that are closer to the data. While the quality of
the light curve ﬁts do not allow us to distinguish between wind
and shell models, there exists signiﬁcantly more literature de-
scribing the interaction of SN ejecta with a wind density pro-
ﬁle. Therefore the remaining analysis will focus more on the
wind model. This will also be useful when we come to model
the radio light curve in section 7.

No explicit velocity comparison is possible, since the sim-
ple interaction model assumes a stationary CSM. However,
as is often the case when modelling SLSNe, the exclusively
high-velocity lines seen in the spectrum may be difﬁcult to
reconcile with having (cid:38) 10 M(cid:12) of slower-moving material
around the star. In an attempt to address this issue more quan-
titatively, we can use some of the analytic equations given by
Chevalier & Irwin (2011) in conjunction with our ﬁts. Those
authors parameterised the wind as a function of radius as
ρw = ˙M/(4πvw)r−2 ≡ 5.0×1016D∗r−2, where ρw is the density
˙M is the mass-loss rate, vw is the wind velocity,

We found that the peak luminosity is quite sensitive to D∗;
the value for the wind models in Figure 20 is D∗ = 19.4 (or
equivalently, ˙M/v10 ≈ 0.2 M(cid:12) yr−1, where v10 is the wind ve-
locity in units of 10 km s−1). In the Chevalier & Irwin (2011)
framework, this can be used to calculate an effective diffusion

where the subscripts refer to normalisation of the parameters
to 0.34 cm2 g−1, 1051 erg and 10 M(cid:12) as used by those authors.
Our light curve models give estimates for all of these parame-
ters (Table 2), leading to Rd = 7.3×1015 cm, which is reassur-
ingly close to the radii determined from blackbody ﬁts (Figure
17).

Chevalier & Irwin (2011) found that the SN behaviour de-
pended on whether the terminal radius of the wind, Rw, was
larger or smaller than Rd. They predicted that for Rw > Rd, a
dense shell forms deep in the wind, leading to low velocities,
and continued late-time interaction that gives a ﬂattening in
the light curve. On the other hand, if Rw < Rd, the outermost
layers are accelerated by radiation pressure, and there is little
power input after maximum light. The authors suggest that
SLSNe I are examples of the latter situation, whereas SLSNe
IIn correspond to the former. For SN 2015bn, our models give
Rw = 5.6-6.4×1015 cm, depending on the CSM mass. Thus we

Figure 21. Example of a model with two detached shells of CSM to

mass-loss rate for the region shell is ˙M/v10 = 0.2 M(cid:12) yr−1, while the
outer region has ˙M/v10 = 0.05 M(cid:12) yr−1. See Table 3 for a full de-
scription of the model parameters.

are in the regime Rw (cid:46) Rd, possibly resolving the lack of nar-
row lines in the spectrum. In this case we do not expect to see
a ﬂattening of the light curve, which is indeed borne out by
our model ﬁts (but interestingly, not by the data). Therefore
another energy source must power the tail. Rw (cid:46) Rd was also
found to be the case for SN 2010gx (Chevalier & Irwin 2011);
however Chomiuk et al. (2011) applied the same analysis to
PS1-10ky and PS1-10awh and found Rw (cid:38) Rd. Within this
approximate framework, the more robust constraint seems to
be that Rw ≈ Rd, which is required for efﬁcient production of
radiation (Chomiuk et al. 2011). Finally, the Chevalier & Ir-
win (2011) model allows us to calculate a shock velocity of
≈ 7000 km s−1 assuming an 80 d rise time based on the ob-
served data.

In order to recover the slow late-time decline rate present in
the data, we introduced a few solar masses of 56Ni to both the
wind and shell models. We kept the other parameters constant
where possible (we used average values for the shell models),
and found that adding 3-5 M(cid:12) of 56Ni to each model could re-
produce the late-time behaviour. This is shown in Figure 20.
For the wind model, we decreased ρCSM to better match the
light curve shape around peak, while increasing the interac-
tion radius to keep the peak brightness constant (this is equiv-
alent to keeping the pre-explosion mass-loss rate and velocity
constant). The interaction models with 56Ni-decay give good
ﬁts to the light curve, although the values of MNi are extremely
large – normal core-collapse SNe have MNi ≈ 0.1 M(cid:12), and
even LGRB-SNe synthesize MNi (cid:46) 0.5 M(cid:12) (e.g. SN 1998bw;
Woosley et al. 1999).

The alternative scenario sees the shallower tail phase of the
light curve powered by further interaction with mass-loss at
a larger radius. This is appealing, since we do not need to
invoke both a large CSM mass and a large 56Ni mass. We
construct such a model by ﬁrst ﬁtting an interaction model to
the data at t < 60 d, and then subtracting this from the whole
light curve. We then ﬁt the residuals at t > 60 d as an in-
teraction with additional CSM. Most of the model parame-
ters for this second interaction are ﬁxed by the ﬁt parame-
ters of the ﬁrst interaction. In the following discussion, we
use the subscripts 1 and 2 to refer to the ﬁts around peak
and to the late-time residuals, respectively. The ﬁxed pa-
rameters are Mej,2 = Mej,1 + MCSM,1; Ek,2 = Ek,1 − Erad,1 (where
Erad is the total energy lost through radiation, ≈ 2× 1051 erg);

Rint,2 = RCSM,1 +(cid:112)(10Ek,2)/(3Mej,2)∆t (where RCSM is the

outer radius of the CSM, and ∆t is the time between shock
breakout from the inner CSM and the second interaction –
this is approximately equal to the time from maximum light
until the beginning of the tail phase, i.e. ≈ 60 d). Therefore
the only free parameters are MCSM,2 and ρ0,2. For a given den-
sity, the CSM mass only affects the duration of the second
interaction but not the luminosity, thus this parameter is only
weakly constrained by the data. However, we ﬁnd that we
require MCSM,2 (cid:38) 10 M(cid:12).

The best-ﬁtting model is shown in Figure 21. While the
late-time ﬁt is not as good as the 56Ni-powered model in Fig-
ure 20, we caution that we are now pushing the simpliﬁed
analytic CSM model to its limits, and this ﬁt is intended only
to give an order-of-magnitude estimate for the mass-loss rate
required to give the shallower tail phase. In this case we ﬁnd
˙M/v10 ≈ 0.05 M(cid:12) yr−1. (see Table 3 for a full description of
the model parameters). As this model is only approximate,
it is possible that a continuous CSM could also ﬁt the data,
for example a dense inner shell, attached to an outer wind
component. Regardless, the luminosity at late times seems
to require a mass-loss rate ˙M/v10 (cid:38) 0.01 M(cid:12) yr−1. However,
this model raises questions about the spectroscopic evolution.
While it is conceivable that the single-shell model could avoid
showing narrow lines in certain circumstances, it seems likely
that the outer CSM, which remains unshocked around light
curve maximum, would imprint low-velocity features on the
observed spectrum. This is essentially the same conclusion
reached by Chevalier & Irwin (2011), as discussed above.
One possible way to avoid seeing narrow lines at early times
could be if this outer CSM were a face-on disk or torus.

6.4. Radioactive decay models

In section 5, it was observed that the late-time decline rates
of SN 2015bn and a number of other SLSNe I look very sim-
ilar to the radioactive decay of 56Co, the daughter nucleus of
56Ni. We also saw above that introducing a few solar masses
of 56Ni to the interaction models gave a good ﬁt to the tail
luminosity. However, powering this phase by 56Co alone
would imply that ≈ 15 M(cid:12) of 56Ni were synthesised in the

elling the bolometric luminosity. We ﬁt a diffusion model with

explosion, using the scaling relations of Hamuy (2003). This
would require the pair-instability explosion of a stellar core of
over 110 M(cid:12), according to the models of Kasen et al. (2011).
Such a scenario was ruled out for PTF12dam by Nicholl et al.
(2013), based on the rise time and blue spectra. In addition
to the spectroscopic and photometric similarity between these
two events, the undulations in the light curve of SN 2015bn
seem to be incompatible with a PISN, as such a huge ejected
mass would be expected to wash out any undulating struc-
ture in the light curve due to the very long diffusion time
(e.g. Fraser et al. 2013). Thus it is difﬁcult to conceive of a
plausible model in which the tail phase of SN 2015bn is pre-
dominantly powered by 56Co-decay. However, the conspiracy
among an increasing number of SLSNe I to match this decline
rate is certainly intriguing, and we therefore examine radioac-
tively powered models in some detail here.

We ﬁtted the light curve of SN 2015bn with a 56Ni-powered
model, ﬁnding that reasonable ﬁts were only possible with
MNi ≈ Mej. The best-ﬁt model shown in Figure 22 has Mej ≈
27.0 M(cid:12), MNi ≈ 26.5 M(cid:12). In order to decrease the diffusion
time to ﬁt the narrower shape around peak, a large explosion
energy of Ek = 3×1052 erg was required. This in turn reduced

the photosphere recedes looks quite different from the slow
decline exhibited by SN 2015bn.

In Figure 23, we compare the late-time spectrum of SN
2015bn to the model spectrum of a 130 M(cid:12) hydrogen-poor
PISN, at a similar phase, from Jerkstrand et al. (2016). The
model gives a good match to the oxygen and calcium lines
between ∼ 6000-8000 Å. We note that strong oxygen and
calcium lines in the nebular phase are not unique to PISNe,
but are generically seen in core-collapse SNe (e.g. Filippenko
1997). The match to the line widths and overall luminosity
scale are good. Interestingly, this match at red wavelengths
is much better than was seen in similar comparisons between
the PISN models and SN 2007bi and PTF12dam (Jerkstrand
et al. 2016). However, there is a huge discrepancy between
the model and data below ≈ 5500 Å. In the PISN model, line-
blanketing by the large iron mass suppresses the ﬂux in the
blue, whereas the late spectrum of SN 2015bn retains a pro-
nounced blue continuum that is brighter than the model by
an order of magnitude. This discrepancy has previously been
pointed out for other slow-declining SLSNe by Dessart et al.
(2012); Nicholl et al. (2013); Jerkstrand et al. (2016). We
note that line formation at bluer wavelengths may be more
complex compared to in the red, but it is unclear what model
deﬁciencies could account for the scale of this difference be-
tween model and data. Despite the similarity in the light curve
slope and spectrum above 6000 Å at late times, there remain
many important differences between the observational data
and models powered exclusively by 56Ni.

6.5. The nature of the undulations

Having discussed the possible power sources for the bulk of
the light curve, we now turn to interpretations of the shoulder
and knee. In both cases, the temperature evolution suggests
that an additional heat source is active over these times, as all
of the power sources we have considered (56Ni-decay, mag-
netar, or shock heating from interaction) predict a monotonic
decline from maximum. The discussion in this section will
focus on the two models that gave the more convincing ﬁts in
the previous section (magnetar spin-down and CSM interac-
tion), beginning with interaction.

Similar light curve undulations to those observed in SN
2015bn were also seen in the light curve of SN 2009ip, which
is thought to be either a Type IIn SN or a SN imposter (Pas-
torello et al. 2013). Either way, the luminosity at maximum
light was powered by interaction with pre-expelled material
(e.g. Mauerhan et al. 2013; Fraser et al. 2013; Smith et al.
2013; Margutti et al. 2014a; Graham et al. 2014). However,
Fraser et al. (2013) note that an interaction between more
than a few solar masses of ejecta and CSM (which would cer-
tainly be required to match the high luminosity in SN 2015bn)
would struggle to match the undulations, as these would tend
to be washed out by the long diffusion time. Therefore the
most probable way to explain these using CSM interaction
is to introduce multiple collisions with additional shells or

Figure 23. Comparison of selected spectra with PISN models from
Kasen et al. (2011, top, middle) and Jerkstrand et al. (2016, bottom).
The Jerkstrand et al. (2016) model was calculated at 400 d after ex-
plosion; we scale the luminosity to 325 d after explosion (250 d after
peak for SN 2015bn) using the well-known 56Co decay rate. The
PISN suffers from extreme iron line-blanketing at blue wavelengths,
and overall shows much redder colours than SN 2015bn. However,

the γ-ray trapping efﬁciency at late times, leading to a ﬁnal
decline rate that is faster than 56Co-decay. The model is un-
convincing both in terms of the unrealistic 56Ni-fraction in the
ejecta and a poor overall ﬁt to the light curve. Moreover, this
model predicts a low photospheric temperature, and a very
high velocity. The high velocity is due to the large value of
Ek. In general, this ﬁt is inferior to the magnetar and interac-
tion models.

We also compare to hydrodynamic simulations of PISNe
calculated by Kasen et al. (2011). The peak luminosity is
well-matched by the explosion of a 130 M(cid:12) stripped-envelope
PISN, synthesising 40 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. It also matches the decline
rate at times (cid:38) 50-100 d, but the faster decline observed in
the data from 0-50 d is difﬁcult to reconcile with this model.
The rise time of this model is also too long relative to the
data, even including the earliest point. The absolute luminos-
ity of SN 2015bn at this phase is in better agreement with the
120 M(cid:12) model, which has 24 M(cid:12) of 56Ni, similar to our own
diffusion ﬁt (the decay energy in PISN models remains fully
trapped at late times due to the large ejected mass). However,
this lower-mass model severely underestimates the peak lumi-
nosity and does not reproduce the behaviour for times earlier
than +50 d. One possibility that could perhaps match the light
curve shape would be to add strong CSM interaction around
peak to the 120 M(cid:12) PISN model. However, this would require
invoking an extreme CSM mass as well as the extreme ejecta
and 56Ni masses, and a detailed investigation of such a model
is beyond the scope of this paper. The temperature in the more
massive (hotter) 130 M(cid:12) model is cooler than SN 2015bn by
about 3000 K at all times. The velocity in this model gives a
fairly good match until about +50 d, but the rapid decline as

All of the aforementioned studies of SN 2009ip found that
at least some of the features in the light curve could be ex-
plained by successive collisions with mass expelled in previ-
ous observed outbursts of the progenitor. If we believe that the
historical CSS detection of SN 2015bn at ≈ 185 d before ex-
plosion was an outburst of the progenitor, and that interaction
with this material powers the knee or shoulder, the blackbody
radii at these epochs (Figure 17) would imply that the pre-
expelled material had a velocity of ∼ 3000 km s−1. This would
be compatible with pulsational pair-instability mass ejections
(Woosley et al. 2007).

However, the blackbody radius in SN 2015bn immediately
begins to decrease at the onset of the knee phase. This may
be difﬁcult to explain in an interaction model, as the colli-
sion with a massive shell should initially be optically thick
(e.g. Moriya & Maeda 2012).
In SNe powered by interac-
tion, the radius of the emitting surface generally shows an
increase as the shock propagates through the CSM (e.g. Fas-
sia et al. 2000; Margutti et al. 2014a). This may not be too
problematic, as only a relatively small amount of CSM is
needed to power the undulations. For example taking the
knee feature, we ﬁnd that SN 2015bn is over-luminous by
2× 1043 erg s−1 for 15 d, compared to a smooth decline. As-
suming a velocity v = 7000 km s−1 from the spectrum at this
phase, we can use the common scaling relation (Quimby
et al. 2007; Smith & McCray 2007) L ≈ 1
2 MCSMv2/trise, giv-
ing MCSM,knee ∼ 0.05 M(cid:12). Such a low CSM mass, relative
to the ejecta masses in any of our models, could help to ex-
plain why we do not see a sudden change in the spectrum at
this phase. However, the low mass is probably not compatible
with pulsational-PISN shells; the ﬁnal pulses before explo-
sion in all of the Woosley et al. (2007) models eject at least
(cid:38) 1 M(cid:12).

Next we consider the magnetar model. Before investi-
gating any magnetar-speciﬁc means of producing the undu-
lations in the light curve, it should be pointed out that the
low-mass CSM interaction described above could equally ap-
ply to a light curve that was primarily powered by magnetar
spin-down. Nevertheless, the magnetar scenario does have
other means of producing ﬂuctuations in the light curve. One
such mechanism is the magnetar-powered shock breakout de-
scribed by Kasen et al. (2015).
In this model, the central
overpressure from the magnetar wind drives a second shock
through pre-exploded ejecta, which breaks out at large radius
and hence can give a bright optical display. However, their
equation 26 shows that this breakout should happen within
20 d of explosion for any sensible combination of ejecta mass,
explosion energy and magnetar parameters. Moreover, the
breakout would not be noticeable in the light curve if it oc-
curred near maximum brightness. Therefore this model is
only applicable to early-time bumps, and not to the shoulder
or knee in SN 2015bn.

Metzger et al. (2014) found that for a magnetar-powered

SN, the hard radiation ﬁeld should drive ionization fronts out-
wards from the base of the ejecta. Being the most abun-
dant element in Type Ic SN ejecta, oxygen was considered
to be the dominant source of electrons at early times. Their
model predicted that when the O II layer reached the ejecta
surface, the opacity to UV photons would decrease, leading
to a UV-breakout. This occurred on a timescale of tens of
days after explosion, and this timescale increases with ejecta
mass. Comparing with the properties of SN 2015bn during
the shoulder phase, this model seems to consistently explain
its timing, the fact that it is only apparent in the blue and UV
bands, and the presence of O II lines in the spectrum at this
time. The fast decline in the colour temperature during this
phase also indicates that it could be a form of breakout event.
During the knee plateau from +30-50 d, the photospheric ra-
dius starts to decrease, and equivalent widths of spectral lines
from heavier species such as iron and silicon increase. This
seems to indicate that the photosphere is beginning to undergo
signiﬁcant recession into the ejecta. The velocity evolution
slows at around this time, suggesting that the velocity pro-
ﬁle is relatively ﬂat within a certain radius. Kasen & Bildsten
(2010) predicted that the magnetar wind would sweep up most
of the ejecta into a dense shell with uniform velocity. More-
over, they show that the temperature jumps sharply at the edge
of this shell. The knee, and the associated increase in temper-
ature and ﬂattening in velocity, could therefore be explained
by the photosphere crossing into this hotter region as it re-
cedes. If SLSNe I are generally powered by magnetars, one
may wonder why this distinctive behaviour is not seen more
often. The answer could be that, in lower mass events, the
magnetar wind sweeps up essentially all of the ejecta, such
that there is no discontinuity. Alternatively, it could simply be
that most SLSN light curves do not have sufﬁcient temporal
sampling for us to catch variations on this timescale.

Another possibility to be considered is that one or both of
the undulations are powered by recombination, similar to the
plateaus in Type IIP SNe. However, the high temperature
and the spectra clearly rule out hydrogen recombination. One
plausible candidate that could be consistent with the shoul-
der is oxygen recombination. Oxygen in SNe is expected
to be mostly singly-ionized at temperatures between 12000-
15000 K, and neutral below this (Hatano et al. 1999; Quimby
et al. 2013). SN 2015bn is seen to drop below ∼ 12000 K at
precisely this phase. The early spectroscopic evolution may
also support this:
the O II lines in SN 2015bn are weak at
∼20 d pre-peak compared with those in PTF12dam and other
SLSNe at similar phases (see Figures 13 and 14). Instead, the
early spectrum closely matches PTF12dam at around maxi-
mum light, when these lines are close to disappearing. This
could suggest that O II is being depleted by recombination.
The photospheric recession during the knee phase may also
point towards recombination. However, it is unclear in this
scenario why the features would be most pronounced in the
UV bands, or which ion could recombine to power the knee

(TBB ≈ 8500 K).
Undulations or plateaus in the light curve evolution could
also in principle result from an abrupt change in the contin-
uum optical/UV opacity, as might arise due to the sudden
emergence of an ionization front through the ejecta (Metzger
et al. 2014). If the ejecta remain largely neutral at early times,
the optical opacity will be due primarily to bound-bound tran-
sitions and could be relatively modest (κ (cid:46) 0.05 cm2 g−1, de-
pending on the composition). However, once the ejecta be-
come ionized and the number of free electrons increases, the
resulting electron scattering opacity would come to dominate,
increasing κ by a factor of several. This sudden rise in opacity
could slightly delay the escape of radiation from the magne-
tar nebula or CSM interaction shocks, producing a plateau or
lull in the light curve decline. Exploring this scenario further
would require a detailed radiative transfer calculation, which
is beyond the scope of this paper.

To see the undulations more clearly, and to look for any
hints of periodicity, we removed the gross structure of the
light curve to examine the residuals. We did this by ﬁtting
and then subtracting low-order polynomials (we tried ﬁrst-,
second- and third-order). We also experimented with subtract-
ing one of the magnetar-powered ﬁts (solid line in Figure 19).
Figure 24 shows the bolometric light curve after subtraction
of the various ﬁts. The detrended data are seen to exhibit vari-
ation on a timescale of ≈ 30-50 d. A dominant timescale of
(cid:46) 50 d would be inconsistent with a very massive model, such
as a PISN. However, it is fully consistent with the diffusion
timescale in an ejecta of ≈ 7-15 M(cid:12) (Arnett 1982; Nicholl
et al. 2015b), which is similar to what we infer from our mag-
netar ﬁts. Thus the undulations seem to be compatible with
variations in the velocity/density structure in ejecta similar to
that in our magnetar models.

If the undulations are really periodic, this could indicate
that they are caused by interaction with a spiral density per-
turbation, perhaps caused by binary interaction (Fraser et al.
2013). Evidence of close binary interaction would certainly
be an intriguing part of the picture for understanding SLSN
progenitors. Unfortunately, the data do not span a sufﬁciently
long time interval (∆t ≈ 150 d) to reliably pick out periodic-
ity on a timescale on this order (t0 ≈ 50 d≈ ∆t/3). For ex-
ample, Martin et al. (2014) applied a periodogram analysis to
SN 2009ip, but ignored peaks in the power spectrum with pe-
riods (cid:38) ∆t/3. Although the undulations in the light curve of
SN 2015bn are an important clue to the nature of this explo-
sion, sampling over much longer timescales will be needed
to robustly test for periodicity or the presence of a dominant
timescale.

7. RADIO NON-DETECTIONS

We observed SN 2015bn with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA; Perley et al. 2011) on 2015 Dec 11
(Alexander et al. 2016). This date is 238 d after optical
maximum, and approximately 320-335 d after explosion if

+120 days, after subtracting polynomial ﬁts (coloured lines) and

timescales of 30-50 d.

we assume a similar light curve morphology to LSQ14bdq.
This epoch is useful for discriminating between a number of
competing models, especially as interaction models are ex-
pected to be optically thick around 5-20 GHz before optical
maximum owing to synchrotron self-absorption (Chevalier
1998), and particularly free-free absorption if the surround-
ing medium is very dense (Chevalier 1982).

Observations were carried out while the VLA was in its
most compact conﬁguration (D conﬁguration, where all an-
tennae are within ≈ 0.6 km of the array centre), and obtained
in two frequency bands: C-band (mean frequency of 5.5 GHz)
and K-band (22 GHz). Each band has a total bandwidth of
2 GHz (split up into two sub-bands), and we observed for
30 min on-source in each. No source was detected at the
position of SN 2015bn in either band. The C band obser-
vation was degraded at low frequencies by a bright radio
source ≈ 6’ from the SN coordinates, so we concentrate on
the high-frequency sub-band (mean frequency 7.4 GHz). The
K band data were unaffected by this contaminating source.
After self-calibration, we derived the following 3σ upper lim-
its on the radio emission from SN 2015bn: F7.4GHz < 75 µJy;
F22GHz < 40 µJy.

7.1. Comparison to gamma-ray bursts

We ﬁrst tested whether these limits can constrain the pres-
ence of an off-axis γ-ray burst. It is generally thought that
SLSNe I could be connected in some way to LGRB-SNe.
Lunnan et al. (2014) found that they occur in similar envi-
ronments, though recently Angus et al. (2016) have proposed
that the only similarity is low metallicity. In any case, both
types of explosions display similar spectra lacking in hydro-
gen and helium (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2010), and both may be
powered by central engines. Recently, Greiner et al. (2015)
presented a luminous (M ≈ −20) SN associated with an ultra-

dictions of off-axis LGRB models with Ek,jets = 2 × 1051 erg and a
particle density of 1 cm−3. The limit on the radio emission from SN
2015bn robustly rules out a healthy jet. A low-luminosity GRB can-
not be excluded. Comparison sample: Margutti et al. (2013), and
references therein.

long GRB, but it was not clear from the relatively featureless
spectrum whether this was a ‘classical’ SLSN I. The presence
of a radio afterglow from a conﬁrmed SLSN would ﬁrmly
establish the SLSN-GRB connection; alternatively, a lack of
radio emission could instead indicate that either no stable jet
forms, or it does not break out of the massive progenitor, and
thus does not accelerate the outer ejecta to relativistic velocity.
We compare models for LGRB-SNe at a variety of view-
ing angles in Figure 25. The simulations are described by
Van Eerten et al. (2010), and assume typical LGRB parame-
ters: total kinetic energy in the two jets of Ek,jets = 2×1051 erg;
a homogeneous particle density of n = 1 cm−3 in the surround-
ing medium; equal fractions of the total energy density in
magnetic ﬁelds and relativistic electrons (B = e = 0.1); jet
half-opening angle θjet = 0.2 rad; isotropic-equivalent energy
Eiso = 1053 erg; and a power-law slope of p = 2.5 for the ac-
celerated electron distribution. For explosions viewed further
from the jet axis, the radio emission is weaker, and peaks later.
The models are calculated at a frequency of 8.5 GHz, which
gives a good match to the observer-frame 7.4 GHz limit for
SN 2015bn.

Our deep radio limit for SN 2015bn rules out even the most
off-axis model, making SN 2015bn the ﬁrst SLSN for which
we can robustly exclude a luminous LGRB. However, we also
compare to a sample of observed ‘low-luminosity’ (ll) GRBs,
for which the emission does not seem to be strongly colli-
mated as in LGRBs. ll-GRBs may form a separate population
from high-luminosity LGRBs, and dominate the volumetric

GRB rate locally (Guetta & Della Valle 2007; Liang et al.
2007). As demonstrated by the ﬁgure, we cannot rule out
a ll-GRB associated with SN 2015bn, and can only exclude
the luminous and highly-collimated jets of a ‘healthy’ LGRB.
Similarly deep radio observations of the next nearby SLSN I
before or around optical maximum should be able to constrain
the presence of a ll-GRB.

7.2. Comparison to models for the optical luminosity

Radio observations can also be useful in breaking the de-
generacies between the competing models for the optical light
curve. While the magnetar and interaction models give sim-
ilarly good ﬁts to the optical data, their predicted radio sig-
natures are very different. In general, radio synchrotron emis-
sion is generated by electrons accelerated to relativistic veloc-
ities at the forward shock (Chevalier 1982; Weiler et al. 2002;
Chevalier & Fransson 2006).

If SLSNe I are otherwise fairly normal Type Ic SNe that
are reheated by a magnetar engine, we expect the radio prop-
erties to resemble those of typical Type Ic SNe. For those
objects, the CSM density is relatively low, with radio light
curves implying mass-loss rates of around 10−7-10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1
(if the wind velocity is 103 km s−1; e.g. Berger et al. 2002;
Soderberg 2007; Drout et al. 2015). The interaction is domi-
nated by the outermost, fastest ejecta (v (cid:38) 0.15c), which car-
ries only ∼ 10−5 of the total kinetic energy (Matzner & Mc-
Kee 1999), while the dominant source of absorption is syn-
chrotron self-absorption (Chevalier 1998). Most normal SNe
Ic (i.e. no LGRB) that have been detected in the radio peaked
at L8GHz (cid:46) 1028 erg s−1 Hz−1, on a timescale of tens of days
(Berger et al. 2003; Soderberg et al. 2010; Margutti et al.
2014b), though there are some exceptions (e.g. Kamble et al.
2016). Generally, the predicted luminosity at ∼ 300 d is well
below our limit for SN 2015bn. Radio emission from the mag-
netar itself is not expected, as Galactic magnetars are not de-
tected as radio sources (e.g. Gaensler et al. 2001), and any
signal that was emitted would be obscured by free-free ab-
sorption in the ionised inner regions of the ejecta (Chomiuk
et al. 2011). In conclusion, our radio observation is not con-
straining for the magnetar model.

For the alternative model in which the optical luminosity
is powered by interaction with CSM, the masses and densi-
ties involved are much higher; our best-ﬁt wind model has a
mass-loss rate higher than that inferred for normal SNe Ic by
several orders of magnitude (if normalized to the same wind
velocity). In this regime, all of the ejecta interacts with the
massive CSM, and therefore the kinetic energy involved is
the total energy of the ejecta, ≈ few × 1051 erg (section 6).
For the very dense mass-loss in our CSM ﬁts, we expect that
the radio emission will be obscured by free-free absorption
until well after maximum light (for example radio emission
in Type II SNe – which have mass-loss rates intermediate be-
tween Type Ic SNe and our models here – peaks at (cid:38) 100 d
after explosion; Weiler et al. 2002).

For each of the models shown in Figure 20, the forward
shock reaches the outer edge of the CSM at the time of op-
tical maximum; the declining light curve is then powered by
diffusion of the stored shock energy. This is similar to the
statement that Rw ≈ Rd (section 6.3). Nicholl et al. (2014)
ﬁtted a number of SLSN light curves with this interaction
model, and also found that good ﬁts required shock break-
out at around maximum light. In this scenario, we might ex-
pect to see radio emission around optical maximum, when the
shock is near the outer surface of the CSM. Once the shock
expands past the CSM, there is no further particle accelera-
tion. Adiabatic expansion rapidly reduces the energy density
in relativistic particles and magnetic ﬁelds, and the radio lu-
minosity falls off rapidly (Lν ∝ t−6; Chomiuk et al. 2011) –
therefore we expect no radio emission at late times if there is
no more mass to interact with outside of Rw.

However, the late-time light curve of SN 2015bn could in-
dicate continued interaction with CSM further out from the
progenitor, for example a tail of lower density material caus-
ing the change in decline rate after around 70 d.
In Fig-
ure 21, we showed a model that was powered by continued
interaction with an extended outer region of CSM that had
˙M/v10 = 0.05 M(cid:12) yr−1, where v10 is the wind velocity normal-
ized to 10 km s−1. Several other SLSNe also show a more
gradual decline at late times (Figure 18). Radio observations
at this phase can help to distinguish whether the slow luminos-
ity decline is indeed powered by continued interaction, rather
than 56Ni-decay or a magnetar. If interaction is the culprit,
as would be conﬁrmed by bright radio emission, we can then
use the radio luminosity to probe the mass-loss history of the
progenitor.

We tested this scenario by comparing our deep late-time
radio limit to the predictions of interaction-powered models.
Based on our estimate from Figure 21 (see also Table 3), we
assume that the late time luminosity is powered by contin-
ued interaction with a wind density proﬁle located outside of
Rint = 1015 cm. We can safely ignore the properties of any in-
ner, denser regions of CSM, as the radio observations were
carried out 200 d after the transition to the shallower decline
rate, indicating the shock should long have left the dense
region and will interact only with the outer material. Our
model, which includes free-free absorption and synchrotron
self-absorption (for further details on the model, see Kamble
et al. 2014, 2016), conservatively assumes a shock velocity of
5000 km s−1, which is at the lower end of the range we ﬁnd in
our ﬁts to the optical light curve.

The radio spectral energy distributions of these models
are shown in Figure 26. Comparing to our limits for SN
2015bn, we can see that it is our high-frequency observa-
tion that proves to be constraining. Therefore we compare
the 22 GHz observation to the radio light curves in Figure 27.
These models are calculated at 24 GHz to give a good match
to the rest-frame frequency of the data. As demonstrated by
the ﬁgure, the observational limit excludes models with mass-

Figure 26. Radio spectra at the approximate time of our observa-
tion of SN 2015bn for interaction models with Ek = 4× 1051 erg and
vSN = 8000 km s−1, and a variety of mass-loss rates, parameterised
as ˙M/10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1 (vw/10 km s−1)−1. The low-frequency limit is not
constraining, but the high-frequency limit can exclude a range of
mass-loss rates.

Figure 27. The radio light curves of interaction models at 24 GHz.
Our limit for SN 2015bn excludes models with mass-loss rates be-
tween 10−2.7 < ˙M < 10−2.0 M(cid:12) yr−1. Models with ˙M ∼ 10−1 M(cid:12) yr−1
(as implied by the optical light curve) peak later than our observa-
tion, at around 3 years after explosion.

loss rates of 10−2.7 (cid:46) ˙M/v10 (cid:46) 10−2 M(cid:12) yr−1. Using a faster
shock velocity does not greatly impact upon these results, but
would generate brighter radio light curves that would rule out
a slightly wider range in mass-loss rates. The largest mass-
loss rate that we can exclude, ˙M/v10 = 0.01 M(cid:12) yr−1, is close
to our estimate for that needed to power the late-time op-
tical light curve through continued ejecta-CSM interaction.
Models with ˙M/v10 ≈ 0.1 M(cid:12) yr−1 reach radio maximum at
103 days after explosion. Therefore radio observations at
ν (cid:38) 20 GHz, carried out over the coming months and years,
corresponding to progressively denser CSM, should be able to
conﬁrm or rule out the continued-interaction model we used

26

to ﬁt the late-time optical light curve. This is perhaps the ﬁrst
easily testable prediction that can potentially distinguish be-
tween interaction- and magnetar-powered models.
Inspection of Figure 26 shows that for high mass-loss
rates ( ˙M/v10 ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12) yr−1), the synchrotron ﬂux is expected
to peak in the millimeter range, suggesting that future ob-
servations of SLSNe should use both radio and millime-
ter observations to constrain the SED. The Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) should be able to
reach the required sensitivity for the next SLSN at z ≈ 0.1.

8. HOST GALAXY

The host of SN 2015bn is visible as a faint, compact blue
source in SDSS. This is not surprising, as all SLSNe I to
date have been found in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (Neill
et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2013; Lunnan et al. 2014; Chen et al.
2015; Leloudas et al. 2015), with the exception of ASASSN-
15lh (Dong et al. 2016), which is also distinct because of
its luminosity. The SDSS magnitudes from Data Release 12
(Alam et al. 2015) are u = 23.11 ± 0.39, g = 22.30 ± 0.10,
r = 22.06± 0.13, i = 22.06± 0.19, and z = 21.63± 0.44. The
source is marginally detected by GALEX in the NUV band
(but not in FUV) at mNUV = 23.62± 0.59. Using the SDSS
colour transformations of Jordi et al. (2006), we ﬁnd an ab-
solute B-band magnitude MB ≈ −16.0. This is similar to the
faintest SLSN hosts identiﬁed by Lunnan et al. (2014) and
Leloudas et al. (2015). SN 2015bn outshines its host by 2-5
magnitudes over the course of the 2016 observing season, and
thus image subtraction is not important for the SN photome-
try. Late, deep SN spectra show weak, narrow emission lines
of Hα, Hβ, [O II] λ3727 and [O III] λλ4959,5007 from the
host galaxy, from which we derived the redshift of z = 0.1136.
We measured the line ﬂuxes in the two latest spectra at +106
and +243 d. The mean of these ﬂuxes gives a Balmer decre-
ment Hα/Hβ = 2.41± 0.65, where the large error is due to the
difﬁculty in measuring the very weak Hβ. Comparing this to
the theoretical ratio for Case B recombination, Hα/Hβ = 2.86
(assuming an electron temperature of 10000 K and density of
100 cm−3; Osterbrock 1989), we ﬁnd that the internal dust ex-
tinction in the host, while admittedly quite uncertain, is con-
sistent with our assumed value of E(B − V ) = 0 (see section
3.3).

It is common practice in the literature to estimate the metal-
licity using the strong-line R23 method (Pagel et al. 1979; Mc-
Gaugh 1991; Kobulnicky et al. 1999), particularly as weaker,
temperature-sensitive lines are generally difﬁcult to detect
from the faint hosts of SLSNe (Chen et al. 2015). This di-
agnostic uses ratios of [O II] λ3727, [O III] λλ4959,5007 and
Hβ. The disadvantage of using R23 is that the calibration is
double-valued, with a high- and low-metallicity branch. De-
tection of weak lines can help to break this degeneracy; how-
ever no such lines have been detected for the SN 2015bn host
at the current depth of our observations. We ﬁnd that the lower
branch gives 12 + log(O/H) = 8.05, while the higher branch

gives 8.60. There is an uncertainty of about 0.2 dex associ-
ated with these values due to a noise spike contaminating the
[O II] λ3727 line. Nevertheless, these values are much in line
with other SLSN I hosts (Lunnan et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015;
Leloudas et al. 2015). We note that when it has been possible
to distinguish between the two branches of the R23 relation,
the lower value is generally favoured for SLSN hosts.

We ﬁtted the SDSS magnitudes9 of the host galaxy using
the stellar population code MAGPHYS (Da Cunha et al. 2008).
This code employs a library of stellar evolution and popula-
tion models from Bruzual & Charlot (2003), treating stellar
and dust contributions to the total luminosity separately. The
formal best-ﬁtting model is shown in Figure 28. MAGPHYS
also calculates likelihood distributions for key model param-
eters. The median stellar mass is found to be 4.2× 108 M(cid:12),
with a 1σ range of 1.8 × 108-1.1 × 109 M(cid:12). This is similar
to many of the SLSN I host galaxies studied by Lunnan et al.
(2014) and Leloudas et al. (2015). The r-band light-weighted
age of the stellar population is ∼ 1.7+2.3
−1.2 Gyr, which is older
than the majority of SLSN hosts, but consistent with the older
galaxies in the Lunnan et al. (2014) sample. However, we
note that this is only weakly constrained, due to the large un-
certainties on the SDSS photometry. A more robust constraint
will only be possible after SN 2015bn has faded. Finally,
the model star-formation rate (SFR) of 0.55 ± 0.18 M(cid:12) yr−1
is typical of these galaxies. We ﬁnd a similar SFR if we
use the measured Hα ﬂux and the scaling relation of Kenni-
cutt (1998): SFR = 7.9×1042(LHα/erg s−1) = 0.36 M(cid:12) yr−1. In
conclusion, the host of SN 2015bn ﬁts the distinctive proﬁle
of the usual galaxies that play host to SLSNe I.

9. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a detailed study of SN 2015bn, one of
the closest and brightest SLSNe I yet discovered. Using a

wide range of facilities, we collected a densely sampled light
curve in the UV, optical and NIR, along with spectroscopy
covering all phases of its evolution. The resulting dataset pro-
vides a new benchmark for observations of SLSNe I, motivat-
ing detailed study. A deep radio observation several hundred
days after explosion gives a physically restrictive limit on both
the presence of relativistic jets and extended dense mass-loss.
SN 2015bn is a slowly-declining SLSN, and in many ways
a typical one. The late-time decline rate is very similar to
PTF12dam and SN 2007bi, as are the persistent blue colours.
The SED matches a hot blackbody in the optical, while the
UV light is strongly affected by absorption lines at maximum
light. The spectroscopic evolution also shows remarkable
similarity to the other slow decliners. We follow the evolu-
tion of all of the strongest lines in the spectrum until > 100 d
from maximum light, ﬁnding an extremely gradual evolution
except for a period between +7-30 d, when a steep tempera-
ture decline triggers a transition from a spectrum dominated
by O II and Fe III to one dominated by Fe II, Ca II, Si II and
Mg I]. Line velocities show a very gradual decline over time.
The host galaxy is clearly a faint, blue dwarf – similar to the
hosts of virtually all SLSNe I.

Yet at the same time, SN 2015bn reveals some surprising
differences that may offer new insight into the nature of these
explosions. The light curve shows a number of distinctive un-
dulations, that seem to indicate a complex density structure –
for example detached CSM shells at large radii, or a magnetar
wind and ionisation fronts. We found that these ﬂuctuations
were much more pronounced at UV wavelengths.

In the spectrum, we tentatively see evidence that there could
be residual hydrogen in some SLSNe I, with some early ab-
sorption features possibly matching Hα and Hβ. We also see
a line in the NIR that could be consistent with He I, which has
been seen in only one previous SLSN I (Inserra et al. 2013).
However, other possibilities exist to explain the potential H
and He features. We make a systematic comparison of the
very late spectra of SLSNe I (fast and slow) with normal and
broad-lined SNe Ic, the latter being associated with LGRBs.
We ﬁnd many similarities that suggest a link between these
various classes, as well as some interesting differences in the
sodium, silicon and calcium lines that may provide clues to
the variations in physical conditions between events.

Applying physical models to the light curve, we found that
both magnetar and CSM-interaction power sources could re-
produce the data. Our best-ﬁt magnetar model suggests that
the ﬁrst detection of SN 2015bn is during the ‘bump’ phase,
and gives a good ﬁt to the temperature and velocity evolu-
tion. For the interaction model, either a transition to a lower-
density outer layer of CSM, or several solar masses of 56Ni in
the ejecta, seem to be required to match the tail phase. Purely
56Ni-powered models, including PISN models, give a good
match only at late times, and the extremely large ejecta mass
associated with the pair-instability means that they struggle
to reproduce the short-timescale behaviour around maximum

light.

One of the greatest mysteries surrounding SLSNe I is the
nature of their apparent connection to LGRBs. This connec-
tion is both observational, in their similar spectra (Figure 15)
and host galaxies (Lunnan et al. 2014; but see Angus et al.
2016), and theoretical, in the central engine models (e.g. Met-
zger et al. 2015). Our late-time radio limit, for the ﬁrst time,
explicitly rules out a healthy off-axis LGRB for an observed
SLSN. This suggests that, if both classes are powered by en-
gines, the SLSN engine may fail to drive a jet through the stel-
lar envelope. However, we cannot exclude a low-luminosity
GRB, so the possibility of a weak jet remains.

On the other hand, if the optical light curve is powered
by interaction, model ﬁts can predict the time at which the
CSM becomes optically thin to radio emission. The mass-
loss rate implied by the late-time bolometric light curve is
˙M/v10 (cid:38) 10−2 M(cid:12) yr−1, while our radio limits rule out a wind
with 10−2.7 ˙M/v10 (cid:46) 10−2 M(cid:12) yr−1. Continued radio observa-
tions of SN 2015bn over the next few years will present a
unique chance to improve constraints on interaction-powered
models for SLSNe and probe the mass-loss histories of their
progenitors.

The depth, cadence and wavelength coverage of the data
presented here make SN 2015bn the most thoroughly ob-
served SLSN I to date. This dataset should provide an invalu-
able resource for modelling efforts and detailed comparisons
with SLSNe discovered in the future. The interesting light
curve sub-structure, along with the recent discovery of the fast
early bumps, shows the importance of observing SLSNe with
a high cadence, despite their light curves being on the whole
broader than normal SNe Ic.

We are continuing to observe SN 2015bn as it slowly fades
away. Deep spectroscopy in the nebular phase and continued
radio follow-up will offer even tighter constraints on the ex-
plosion mechanism. This work shows the importance of fol-
lowing SLSNe over a wide range in wavelength, in order to
break the degeneracy between magnetar and interaction mod-
els and constrain possible progenitors.
