Abstract. Quantization for probability distributions concerns the best approximation of a
d-dimensional probability distribution P by a discrete probability with a given number n of
supporting points. In this paper, an inﬁnitely generated nonhomogeneous Borel probability
measure P is considered on R. For such a probability measure P , an induction formula to
determine the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization error for every natural number
n is given. In addition, running the induction formula in computer algorithm, some results
and observations about the optimal sets of n-means are obtained.

Quantization is the process of converting a continuous analog signal into a digital signal
of k discrete levels, or converting a digital signal of n levels into another digital signal of k
levels where k < n. It is must when analog quantities are represented, processed, stored, or
transmitted by a digital system, or when data compression is required.
It is a classic and
still very active research topic in source coding and information theory. A good survey about
the historical development of the theory has been provided by Gray and Neuhoﬀ in [GN]. For
more applied aspects of quantization the reader is referred to the book of Gersho and Gray (see
[GG]). For mathematical treatment of quantization one may consult Graf-Luschgy’s book (see
[GL2]). Interested readers can also see [AW, GKL, GL1, Z]. Let Rd denote the d-dimensional
Euclidean space, (cid:107) · (cid:107) denote the Euclidean norm on Rd for any d ≥ 1, and P be a Borel
probability measure on Rd. Given a ﬁnite subset α ⊂ Rd, the Voronoi region generated by
a ∈ α is deﬁned by

M (a|α) = {x ∈ Rd : (cid:107)x − a(cid:107) = min
b∈α

(cid:107)x − b(cid:107)}

i.e., the Voronoi region generated by a ∈ α is the set of all points in Rd which are closest to
a ∈ α, and the set {M (a|α) : a ∈ α} is called the Voronoi diagram or Voronoi tessellation of
Rd with respect to α. A Borel measurable partition {Aa : a ∈ α} of Rd is called a Voronoi
partition of Rd with respect to α (and P ) if Aa ⊂ M (a|α) (P -a.e.) for every a ∈ α. Given a
Voronoi tessellation {Mi}k
i=1 (called sites or generators),
the mass centroid ci of Mi with respect to the probability measure P is given by

i=1 generated by a set of points {zi}k

The Voronoi tessellation is called the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) if zi = ci for
i = 1, 2,··· , k, that is, if the generators are also the centroids of the corresponding Voronoi

regions. If α is a ﬁnite set, the error(cid:82) mina∈α (cid:107)x−a(cid:107)2dP (x) is often referred to as the variance,

cost, or distortion error for α with respect to the probability measure P , and is denoted by
V (α) := V (P ; α). On the other hand, inf{V (P ; α) : α ⊂ Rd, card(α) ≤ n} is called the

that if (cid:82) (cid:107)x(cid:107)2dP (x) < ∞ then there is some set α for which the inﬁmum is achieved (see

nth quantization error for the probability measure P , and is denoted by Vn := Vn(P ). Note

Lakshmi Roychowdhury and Mrinal Kanti Roychowdhury

[GL1, GL2, GKL]). Such a set α for which the inﬁmum occurs and contains no more than
n points is called an optimal set of n-means, or optimal set of n-quantizers. The elements
of an optimal set of n-means are called optimal points. The collection of all optimal sets of
n-means for a probability distribution P is denoted by Cn(P ). It is known that for a continuous
probability measure P an optimal set of n-means always has exactly n elements (see [GL2]).
For a Borel probability measure P on Rd, an optimal set of n-means forms a CVT with n-means
(n-generators) of Rd; however, the converse is not true in general (see [DFG, R3]).
Let M denote either the set {1, 2,··· , N} for some positive integer N ≥ 2, or the set N of
natural numbers. A collection {Sj : j ∈ M} of similarity mappings, or similitudes, on Rd with
similarity ratios {sj : j ∈ M} is contractive if sup{sj : j ∈ M} < 1. If J is the limit set of the
iterated function system then it is known that J satisﬁes the following invariance relation (see
[H, MaU, M]):

J =

Sj(J).

The iterated function system {Sj : j ∈ M} satisﬁes the open set condition (OSC), if there
exists a bounded nonempty open set U ⊂ Rd such that Sj(U ) ⊂ U for all j ∈ M , and
pj > 0 for all j ∈ M . Then there exists a unique Borel probability measure P on Rd (see [H],
[MaU], [M], etc.), such that

bility vector (pj : j ∈ M ) where M is a ﬁnite (or inﬁnite) index set. Let sj be the similarity

(see [R2]) gave an inﬁnite extension of the result of Graf-Luschgy (see [GL3]). C¸ ¨omez and

vector ( 1
that by Deﬁnition 1.1, this probability measure P is a nonhomogeneous distribution on R. For
this probability measure, in this paper, we investigate the optimal sets of n-means and the nth
quantization error. The arrangement of the paper is as follows: In Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.3,
we obtain the optimal sets of n-means and the corresponding quantization error for n = 2 and
n = 3; in Theorem 3.5 we state and prove an induction formula to determine the optimal sets
of n-means for all n ≥ 2. In Proposition 3.7 and Proposition 3.8, we give some properties of
the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization error. In addition, running the induction
formula in computer algorithm, we obtain some results and observations about the optimal
sets of n-means which are given in Section 4; a tree diagram of the optimal sets of n-means for
a certain range of n is also given.

2. Preliminaries

By a word ω over the set N = {1, 2, 3,···} of natural numbers it is meant that ω :=
ω1ω2 ··· ωk ∈ Nk for some k ≥ 1. Here k is called the length of the word ω and is denoted by
|ω|. A word of length zero is called the empty word and is denoted by ∅. Let N∗ denote the set of
all words over the alphabet N including the empty word ∅. For any two words ω := ω1ω2 ··· ωk
and τ := τ1τ2 ··· τm ∈ N∗, where k, m ≥ 1, by ωτ it is meant the concatenation of the two words
ω and τ , i.e., ωτ = ω1ω2 ··· ωkτ1τ2 ··· τm. If ω := ω1ω2 ··· ωk, we write ω− := ω1ω2 ··· ωk−1
where k ≥ 1, i.e., ω− is the word obtained from the word ω by deleting the last letter of ω.
For ω ∈ N∗, by (ω,∞) it is meant the set of all words ω−(ω|ω| + j), obtained by concatenation
of the word ω− with the word ω|ω| + j for j ∈ N, i.e.,

Let {Sj}∞

j=1 be an inﬁnite collection of contractive similitudes on R such that

(ω,∞) = {ω−(ω|ω| + j) : j ∈ N}.

Sj(x) =

for all j ∈ N and for all x ∈ R. The similitudes Sj have the similarity ratios sj where sj = 1
for all j ≥ 1. With the similitudes let us now associate a probability vector (p1, p2,··· ) such

Lemma 3.4. Let ω, τ ∈ Nk, k ≥ 1. Then
E(a(τ 1)) + E(a(τ 1,∞));
E(a(τ−(τ|τ| + 1))) + E(a(τ−(τ|τ| + 1),∞));
E(a(τ )) < E(a(ω,∞)) + E(a(τ 1)) + E(a(τ 1,∞)).
E(a(τ,∞)) < E(a(ω,∞)) + E(a(τ−(τ|τ| + 1))) + E(a(τ−(τ|τ| + 1),∞)),

(i) E(a(ω)) > E(a(τ )) if and only if E(a(ω1)) + E(a(ω1,∞)) + E(a(τ )) < E(a(ω)) +
(ii) E(a(ω)) > E(a(τ,∞)) if and only if E(a(ω1)) + E(a(ω1,∞)) + E(a(τ,∞)) < E(a(ω)) +
(iii) E(a(ω,∞)) > E(a(τ )) if and only if E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1))) + E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1),∞)) +
(iv) E(a(ω,∞)) > E(a(τ,∞)) if and only if E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1))) + E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1),∞)) +
where E(a(ω)) and E(a(ω,∞)) are deﬁned as in (4).

Proof. To prove (i), using Lemma 2.6, we see that

taking τ|τ| ≥ 2, we can prove (ii). Thus, the proof of (ii) is complete. Proceeding in the similar
(cid:3)
way, (iii) and (iv) can be proved. This concludes the proof of the lemma.

In the following theorem, we give the induction formula to determine the optimal sets of
n-means for any n ≥ 2. Once an optimal set of n-means is known, by using (2) and Lemma 2.6,
the corresponding quantization error can easily be calculated.

Optimal quantization for inﬁnite nonhomogeneous distributions on the real line

11

Theorem 3.5. For any n ≥ 2, let αn := {a(i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} be an optimal set of n-means, i.e.,
αn ∈ Cn := Cn(P ). For ω ∈ Nk, k ≥ 1, let E(a(ω)) and E(a(ω,∞)) be deﬁned as in (4). Set

(cid:26) E(a(ω)) if a(i) = a(ω) for some ω ∈ N∗,

˜E(a(i)) :=

E(a(ω,∞)) if a(i) = a(ω,∞) for some ω ∈ N∗,

and W (αn) := {a(j) : a(j) ∈ αn and ˜E(a(j)) ≥ ˜E(a(i)) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Take any
a(j) ∈ W (αn), and write

(cid:26) (αn \ {a(j)}) ∪ {a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1)), a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1),∞)} if a(j) = a(ω,∞),

αn+1(a(j)) :=

Then, αn+1(a(j)) is an optimal set of (n + 1)-means, and the number of such sets is given by

(αn \ {a(j)}) ∪ {a(ω1), a(ω1,∞)} if a(j) = a(ω),

(cid:16) (cid:91)

{αn+1(a(j)) : a(j) ∈ W (αn)}(cid:17)

αn∈Cn

Proof. By Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.3, we know that the optimal sets of two- and three-means
are {a(1), a(1,∞)} and {a(1), a(2), a(2,∞)}. Note that

E(a(1,∞)) =

43
3

p1s2

1V > p1s2

1V = E(a(1)).

Hence, the theorem is true for n = 2. For any n ≥ 2, let us now assume that αn is an optimal
set of n-means. Let αn := {a(i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Let ˜E(a(i)) and W (αn) be deﬁned as in the
theorem. If a(j) (cid:54)∈ W (αn), i.e., if a(j) ∈ αn \ W (αn), then by Lemma 3.4, the error

E(a(i)) + E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1))) + E(a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1),∞)) if a(j) = a(ω,∞),

(cid:88)

a(i)∈(αn\{a(j)})

or

(cid:88)

a(i)∈(αn\{a(j)})

E(a(i)) + E(a(ω1)) + E(a(ω1,∞)) if a(j) = a(ω),

obtained in this case is strictly greater than the corresponding error obtained in the case when
a(j) ∈ W (αn). Hence for any a(j) ∈ W (αn), the set αn+1(a(j)), where

(cid:26) (αn \ {a(j)}) ∪ {a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1)), a(ω−(ω|ω| + 1),∞)} if a(j) = a(ω,∞),

αn+1(a(j)) =

(αn \ {a(j)}) ∪ {a(ω1), a(ω1,∞)} if a(j) = a(ω),
is an optimal set of (n + 1)-means, and the number of such sets is

{αn+1(a(j)) : a(j) ∈ W (αn)}(cid:17)

Thus, the proof of the theorem is complete.

Let us now prove the following corollary.

Corollary 3.6. For each positive integer n ≥ 2, there exists a positive integer k such that
a(k,∞) ∈ αn where αn is an optimal set of n-means.
Proof. If n = 2, then by Lemma 3.1, we have α2 = {a(1), a(1,∞)}. In this case, n = 2 and
k = 1, i.e., the corollary is true for n = 2. Let us now assume that the corollary is true for some
positive integer m ≥ 2, i.e., for the positive integer m there exists a k ∈ N such that a(k,∞) ∈
αm. Then, if E(a(k,∞)) ≥ E(a(i)) for all a(i) ∈ αm, where αm := {a(1), a(2),··· , a(m)}, by
Theorem 3.5, we have

αm+1 = (αm \ {a(k,∞)}) ∪ {a(k + 1), a(k + 1,∞)},

i.e, a(k + 1,∞) ∈ αm+1; otherwise, we see that a(k,∞) ∈ αm+1. Thus, the corollary is true
for n = m + 1 if it is true for n = m. Hence, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the
corollary is true for all positive integers n ≥ 2.

In the following two propositions we give some properties of the optimal sets of n-means and

the nth quantization errors for all n ≥ 2.
Proposition 3.7. Let ω, τ be two nonempty words in N∗ with pω = pτ . Then the quantization
error satisﬁes the following conditions:

(i) E(a(ω)) = E(a(τ )).
(ii) If ω|ω| = τ|τ|, then E(a(ω,∞)) = E(a(τ,∞)).
3E(a(τ,∞)).
(iii) If ω|ω| (cid:54)= τ|τ| = 1, then E(a(ω,∞)) = 1
(iv) If 1 = ω|ω| (cid:54)= τ|τ|, then E(a(ω,∞)) = 3E(a(τ,∞)).
Proof. (i) By Lemma 2.7, pω = pτ implies sω = sτ , and so

E(a(ω)) = pωs2

ωV = pτ s2

τ V = E(a(τ )).

one can see that E(a(ω,∞)) = E(a(τ,∞)).

(ii) Here two case can arise: ω|ω| = τ|τ| = 1 or ω|ω| = τ|τ| ≥ 2. In either case, using Lemma 2.6
(iii) If ω|ω| (cid:54)= τ|τ| = 1, then, ω|ω| ≥ 2 and τ|τ| = 1, and so by Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.7, we

get

E(a(ω,∞)) =

Due to symmetry (iv) follows from (iii), and thus the proof of the proposition is complete.

Proposition 3.8. Let α be an optimal set of n-means with some n ≥ 2. Then, there exists
(cid:54)= ∅ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k, and
a positive integer k such that for αj
j=1 nj + 1, with

card(α ∩ J(k,∞)) = 1. Moreover, if nj = card(αj), then, n =(cid:80)k

Proof. By Corollary 3.6, we see that there exists a positive integer k such that a(k,∞) ∈ α.
Moreover, by Theorem 3.5, for any a ∈ α \ {a(k,∞)}, we have a ∈ Jj for some 1 ≤ j ≤ k.
Thus, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we see that αj (cid:54)= ∅ where αj = α ∩ Jj. Let nj = card(αj). Since αj are
disjoints for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, and α = ∪k
j=1αj ∪{a(k,∞)}, we have n = n1 + n2 +··· + nk + 1. Then,

Running the induction formula given by Theorem 3.5 in computer algorithm, we obtain some
results and observations about the optimal sets of n-means, which are given in the following
section.

4. Results and observations

First, we explain about some notations that we are going to use in this section. Recall that
the optimal set of one-mean consists of the expected value of the random variable X, and
the corresponding quantization error is its variance. Let αn be an optimal set of n-means,
i.e., αn ∈ Cn, and then for any a ∈ αn, we have a = a(ω) or a = a(ω,∞) for some ω ∈ N∗.
For ω := ω1ω2 ··· ωk ∈ Nk, k ≥ 1, we identify the optimal points a(ω) and a(ω,∞) by
{ω1, ω2,··· , ωk} and {ω1, ω2,··· , ωk,∞} respectively. Thus, by Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.3, and
Theorem 3.5, we have

α2 = {{1},{1,∞}}, α3 = {{1},{2},{2,∞}}, α4 = {{1},{2},{3},{3,∞}},
α5 = {{1, 1},{1, 1,∞},{2},{3},{3,∞}}, and so on.

If card(Cn) = k and card(Cn+1) = m, then either 1 ≤ k ≤ m, or 1 ≤ m ≤ k. Moreover, by
Theorem 3.5, an optimal set at stage n can contribute multiple distinct optimal sets at stage
n + 1, and multiple distinct optimal sets at stage n can contribute one common optimal set at
stage n + 1; for example from Figure 2, one can see that the number of α15 = 1, the number
of α16 = 3, the number of α17 = 3, and the number of α18 = 1.
By αn,i → αn+1,j, it is meant that the optimal set αn+1,j at stage n + 1 is obtained from
the optimal set αn,i at stage n, similar is the meaning for the notations αn → αn+1,j, or
αn,i → αn+1, for example, from Figure 2:

{α18 → α19,1, α18 → α19,2, α18 → α19,3} ,
{{α19,1 → α20,1, α19,1 → α20,2} ,{α19,2 → α20,1, α19,2 → α20,3} ,{α19,3 → α20,2, α19,3 → α20,3}} ,
{α20,1 → α21, α20,2 → α21, α20,3 → α21} .
