With the goal of pushing Spintronic devices towards faster and faster timescales, we demonstrate,
using ab-intio time-dependent density functional theory simulations of bulk Heusler compounds
subject to ultrashort intense laser pulses, that the local magnetic moment can increase or decrease
in a few femtoseconds. This speed is due to the all optical nature of the process, which transfers spin
moment from one sublattice to another. This transfer depends on easily tunable laser parameters.
By comparing the spin dynamics of a variety of Heusler (or half-Heusler) compounds, we demonstrate
that the density of states explains the observed moment transfer; most the physics of inter sublattice
moment transfer is due to the ﬂow of spin current which is governed by availability of states above
the Fermi level.

Femtomagnetism[1, 2], whereby electronic spins are
manipulated at femtosecond timescales, opens up a whole
new ﬁeld for ultrafast devices which are several orders of
magnitude faster than those currently available[3]. The
fastest timescale on which devices operate is dictated by
the internal processes by which the spins can be modi-
ﬁed. To fully exploit the possibilities of controlling these
ultrafast processes, it is crucial to know the limitations
on the timescale on which this manipulation of spins is
possible. Recently there has been much eﬀort on making
these timescales faster, e.g.
spin-reorientation in anti-
ferromagnets was found to be much faster than previ-
ously anticipated[4, 5].

The most advantageous processes in terms of speed
and ease of manipulation are those that take place in
the coherent regime, i.e. dissipative phenomena such as
coupling to electron-phonon scattering, are not yet dom-
inant. In this regime it is purely electronic processes that
control the physics and since electrons couple directly to
the laser, it allows one to beneﬁt from the extraordinary
progress in creating ultrashort laser pulses over the past
few decades. It is in this regime we will focus our atten-
tion.

Currently,

investigating

experiments[6–17]

laser-
induced spin dynamics all observe a loss of magnetic
moment at short timescales. However,
for full con-
trollability of the moment, a process by which the
moment is increased is required. We show that in the
case of materials with several magnetic sublattices, it
is possible to see an increase in the magnetic moment
before the demagnetization sets in. Although, this
behavior is observed for a particular class of materials,
namely the Heusler family[18], we demonstrate that
the physics of this phenomena is controlled by the
ground-state density-of-states (DOS). This link between
the observed magnetization dynamics and the easily
calculable ground-state DOS makes tailoring of materials
for ultrafast spin manipulation a clear possibility. Fur-
thermore, we show this interpretation is valid for both
ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled

materials,
further expanding the realm of potential
materials which can exploit this form of spin dynamics.

magnetic moment on the X position atom for Heusler com-
pounds NiMnSb, Mn3Ga, and Co2MnSi, following the Heusler
stoichiometry X2YZ (or XYZ for half-Heusler compounds).

The Heusler compounds we will study are Co2MnSi,
NiMnSb, and Mn3Ga with the structural and ground-
state details given in Table I. This choice was motivated
by the fact that despite belonging to the same class they
display very diﬀerent magnetic behavior, thereby allow-
ing us to explore a wide spectrum of possibilities– all
these materials have two magnetic sublattices which are
anti-ferromagnetically coupled in Mn3Ga and ferromag-
netically coupled in the other two systems. NiMnSb
shows a strong diﬀerence in the magnetic moment be-
tween the two sublattices, while this diﬀerence is not so
pronounced in Co2MnSi (see table I for details).

To study the spin and charge dynamics in these mate-
rials under the inﬂuence of ultrafast laser pulses, we will

functional theory (TDDFT). For more details on TDDFT
see Refs. [19–21], and in particular for its application to
spin dynamics see Refs. [22, 23]. To perform our calcula-
tions we will use the full potential linearized augmented-
plane-wave method with 2-component spinors, as imple-
mented in the ELK[24] code. In all calculations a regular
mesh in k-space of 8 × 8 × 8 grid points was used and a
timestep of ∆t = 0.05 au used for the time-propagation
algorithm[22]. The laser ﬁeld applied in all cases is shown
in the upper panel of Fig. 1, the pulse parameters are:
frequency ω = 2.72 eV, FWHM=2.42 fs, and a ﬂuence of
93.5 mJ/cm2 giving a peak intensity of 1 × 1014 W/cm2.
The purpose of this pulse is to disentangle the optical ex-
citation process from any subsequent dynamics such as
spin-orbit mediated demagnetization. Later we will also
perform calculations with much weaker (down to 1×1011
W/cm2) pulses.

In Fig. 1 we plot the percentage change in the local
magnetic moment, as a function of time, for the X atom
(see table I) in each Heusler compound, relative to their
respective ground-state moment. This magnetization dy-
namics is caused by the applied external laser ﬁeld shown
in the upper panel of Fig.1. The three studied materials
behave very diﬀerently; the moment changes dramati-
cally for Ni in NiMnSb with a gain of over 300%, the two
Mn(2,3) atoms of Mn3Ga lose almost all their moment
(100%) and the moment on Co atom stays eﬀectively un-
changed (18% gain). It is interesting to note that these
changes take place on an even faster timescale than the
spin-orbit mediated dynamics observed in Refs. [22, 25].
The spin dynamics in this case is purely due to optical ex-
citations, and so the global moment remains unchanged,
with moment either transferred from one magnetic sub-
lattice to another or transferred to the high-lying de-
localized states. Any experimental measurements that
are atom-sensitive will observe these changes, and, in
fact, such an increase in NiMnSb may have already been
observed[26].

For an in-depth understanding of this spin transfer pro-
cess, we calculate the changes in the up and down spins

pounds under consideration.

of each atom using:

∆N↑↓(t) =

where ∆N (t) = N (t)− N0 is the change in the charge on
the atom compared to the initial time, N0 = N (t = 0)
and similarly for the moment ∆Mz(t) = Mz(t) − Mz(0).
This deﬁnition is valid only when system is collinear. In
the present case the system stays almost collinear de-
spite the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the
external laser ﬁeld, both of which allow for interatomic
non-collinearity.

In Fig. 3 we plot the change in the up and down spins
on each atom for the three cases under investigation. In
ferromagnetic materials with positive global moment, the
loss of up or gain of down electrons would lead to an in-
crease in moment, while a gain of down or a loss of up
spin electrons would lead to decrease in moment. For
anti-ferromagnetic materials, the situation is more com-
plex, if the local moment is positive then the same logic
applies, but if the local moment is negative, a gain of up
or a loss of down will cause a loss in moment, while a
gain of down or a loss of up will lead to a gain of mo-
ment (i.e. an increase the magnitude of this moment).

panels). As in Fig. 1, the XYZ convention may be used to
identify the respective atoms in each case.

FIG. 4. The total density of states for NiMnSb (upper panel),
Co2MnSi (middle panel), and Mn3Ga (lower panel) around
the Fermi level (set to zero) for the up and down electrons.
In each case the contribution of the d-states localized to either
the X and Y postion atoms to the total DOS is represented
by the area ﬁlled.

We ﬁrst look at ferromagnetically coupled systems; in
the case of NiMnSb, the 300% increase in the moment
of the Ni sublattice is due to the loss of down spin elec-
trons by the Ni atom. These electrons are transferred
to the Mn sublattice, leading to a decrease in the mo-
ment of the Mn sublattice. There is a further decrease
in the moment on the Mn sublattice due to a transfer
of some of the Mn spin-up electrons to the higher ly-
ing delocalized states. In the case of Co2MnSi there is
also a small amount of down spins transferred from Co
sublattice to Mn sublattice, but this is compensated by
a small transfer of up spins away from Co, leaving the
local moment almost unchanged.
In the case of anti-
ferromagnetic Mn3Ga down spins are transferred from
the Mn(1) atom to the Mn(2,3) sublattice leading to a
decrease in the moment of both sublattices. This de-
crease if further enhanced by up spins being transferred
from the Mn(2,3) sublattice to the Mn(1) sublattice.

Although, this transfer of up/down electrons provides
an insight into the physics of gain/loss of moment, it does
not tell us why this happens diﬀerently for the three ma-
terials studied and how one can tailor materials to obtain
a desired spin-dynamics. We will now show that this spin
transfer can be understood based on the ground-state
density of states, which is an easily calculable quantity
and can be used for material searches. After such a search
is performed, the results can be veriﬁed by then perform-
ing TDDFT simulations. In Fig. 4, we show the total and
partial DOS (site and d-projected) for all three materi-
als. If we ﬁrst look at the down spin DOS of NiMnSb, we
can see that below the Fermi level the DOS is completely
dominated by Ni states, whereas above, it is dominated

by Mn states. Thus the optical excitation excites from
the spin-down Ni states to the empty Mn d-states, caus-
ing spin-down current to ﬂow from Ni sublattice to Mn
sublattice. The Mn3Ga spin transfer can be similarly
explained by the DOS; for down spin, we see occupied
Mn(1) states and unoccupied Mn(2,3) and vice versa for
up spin, thus the laser will excite both these transitions,
causing the moment to be lost in both sublattices. The
lack of spin transfer from Co to Mn in Co2MnSi can also
be explained in a similar fashion; below the Fermi level
the spin-down DOS is dominated by Co d-states but,
unlike for the case of NiMnSb and Mn3Ga, there is an
equal number of Co and Mn empty down states above the
Fermi level. Due to available states on the same atom, it
is more favorable for almost no spin current to ﬂow from
one sublattice to another. This then tells us that most of
the physics of inter sublattice moment transfer is due to
the ﬂow of spin current which is governed by availability
of states above the Fermi level.

We can further validate this DOS interpretation by
performing additional calculations for diﬀerent systems
with similar DOS or with diﬀerent laser parameters.
Since the spin transfer process is based on pure optical
excitations, it relies on the availability of states reach-
able with the applied laser pulse. Based on the energy
diﬀerence between the occupied and empty states in the
DOS, we can expect signiﬁcant spin transfer due to exci-
tations with an applied laser ﬁeld with frequency ∼ 3 eV.
Choosing a laser frequency such that optical transitions
are weak (e.g. ω = 5.44 eV), as expected, there is signif-
icantly less moment loss by the Mn atom in Co2MnSi is
observed.

FIG. 5. The dynamics of the local moment on the Mn(1)
(lower curves) and Mn(2,3) (upper curves) for several diﬀerent
laser intensities.

Turning now to a diﬀerent a set of materials, but with
similar DOS; the compound Ni2MnGa, whose DOS re-
sembles NiMnSb, also shows the same qualitative behav-
ior as NiMnSb (a gain of 190% by the Ni atom). Sim-
ilarly, the partial DOS of Co2FeSi is almost the same
to that of Co2MnSi and, as expected, we ﬁnd that the
behavior of the local moments is also the same (a 7%
increase on the Co atoms). Note that for Co2FeSi it is
known that the LDA+U method is required for a bet-
ter description of the ground-state. The essential change
in the DOS on using LDA+U is an ultraviolet shift in
occupied down states. Thus it will not change our con-
clusions, but the laser frequency will need to be tuned
based on this new LDA+U DOS.

At this point it is important to note that (a) the inten-
sity of the laser pulses used so far in this work are higher
than commonly used in experiments and (b) the DOS
interpretation relies on the assumption that the applied
laser is a small perturbation and one can rely on ground-
state DOS for analysis. However, the applied laser pulses
in the present work are very intense and this assumption
is not necessarily true. To investigate whether our con-
clusions remain applicable for signiﬁcantly weaker pulses,
as used in experiments, we have studied the intensity de-
pendence of the spin dynamics in Mn3Ga. In Fig. 5 the
Mn(1) and Mn(2,3) local moments are plotted for several
diﬀerent laser intensities. We ﬁnd that even reducing the
intensity by two orders of magnitude to 1× 1012 W/cm2,
still results in the same physics and a moment loss of
15%.

The pulse length used in the present work is shorter
than commonly used in experiments. This is intentional
on our part to disentangle the physics of magnetization
dynamics cause purely due to inter lattice spin-current or
the one mediated by spin-orbit eﬀect, as in Ref. 22. One
can clearly see these two processes mixing together if one

looks at the magnetization dynamics for longer times. In
Fig. 6 such long time behavior of the global magnetic
moment of NiMnSb and Co2FeSi is shown. If the spin-
orbit term is neglected, the spin transfer dynamics is still
observed (in fact simulations with or without SOC both
give the same dynamics for the ﬁrst 6 fs), however there is
no loss in the global moment. On inclusion of spin-orbit
coupling a global loss in moment is observed in both ma-
terials and the diﬀerence between the two calculations
(with and without SOC), gives the amount of moment
lost purely due to SO eﬀects. In Fig. 6, we show the loss
in global moment decomposed into contributions from
each atom. In the case of NiMnSb, we see that it is pri-
marily the Ni moment that undergoes demagnetization.
Similarly, for Co2FeSi major contribution to the demag-
netization comes from the Co atoms. Even though the
electrons are optically excited, the moment on Co atoms
up to 6 fs is basically unchanged from the ground-state
value. The spin-orbit coupling term then acts on this op-
tically excited Co sublattice to demagnetize it. Mn3Ga
was eliminated from this discussion because we do not
see any strong demagnetization of the global moment for
the ﬁrst 20 fs.

Thus we have seen two possible mechanisms for chang-
ing the local moment in Heulser compounds. Firstly op-
tical excitation can lead to inter sub lattice ﬂow of spin
current. This ﬂow of spins may increase or decrease the
local moment. The timescale for this process is extremely
short (a few femtoseconds). Secondly, spin-orbit medi-
ated demagnetization may take place on the now out-of-
equilibrium state. By considering very short laser pulses
in our simulations, we could clearly distinguish these two
process, however for longer duration pulses, the two ef-

We have demonstrated that experimental techniques
that are suﬃciency sensitive to the local moment on indi-
vidual atoms, e.g. the Ni atom in NiMnSb, will ﬁnd a rich
world of ultrafast spin dynamics to explore. This world
contains multiple ways to manipulate the local moments
and thus make the eventual technological transfer of such
physical processes all the more viable. Similarly we have
seen that the Heusler family of materials oﬀers a range of
diﬀerent behaviors under the inﬂuence of ultrashort laser
pulses that demonstrates the ﬂexibility it oﬀers. Under-
standing and controlling the ultrafast spin dynamics of
complex materials will be of key importance to the fu-
ture development and design of Spintronic devices. We
show that despite the strong external ﬁelds, which knock
the system out of equilibrium, in certain cases such a
material design is possible from a simple ground state
calculation because most of the physics of spin dynamics
is controlled by the ﬂow of spin current which is gov-
erned by availability of states above the Fermi level in
the ground-state.
