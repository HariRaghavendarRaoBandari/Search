Spatial plane waves for the nonlinear Schrödinger

equation: local existence and stability results

Simão Correia and Mário Figueira

March 3, 2016

Abstract

We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation on R2, iut `
uxx ` uyy ` λ|u|σu “ 0, λ P R, σ ą 0. We introduce new functional spaces over which
the initial value problem is well-posed. Their construction is based on spatial plane waves
[4]). These spaces contain H 1pR2q and do not lie within L2pR2q. We prove several
(cf.
global well-posedness and stability results over these new spaces, including a new global
well-posedness result of H 1 solutions with indeﬁnitely large H 1 and L2 norms. Some of
these results are proved using a new functional transform, the plane wave transform. We
develop a suitable theory for this transform, prove several properties and solve classical
linear PDE’s with it, highlighting its wide range of application.

Keywords: nonlinear Schrödinger equation; local well-posedness; stability; spatial plane
waves; integral transform.

Introduction

In this work, we consider the initial value problem for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two

spatial dimensions"

iut ` uxx ` uyy ` λ|u|σu “ 0,
up0, x, yq “ u0px, yq,

σ ą 0, λ P R.

u “ upt, x, yq, px, yq P R2

.

(NLS)

This classical equation has been studied intensively for the past ﬁfty years and many prob-
lems regarding local well-posedness, global existence, blowup and asymptotic behaviour have
very complete answers (see the monographs [1], [12], [13] and references therein). The most
standard framework where one studies this initial value problem is based on the following
for any u0 P H 1pR2q, there exists a unique maximal solution
H 1 local well-posedness result:
u P Cpr0, Tpu0qq, H 1pR2qq of (NLS), which depends continuously on the initial data. Moreover,
if Tpu0q ă 8, one has }∇uptq}2 Ñ 8 as t Ñ Tpu0q. The H 1 framework allows one to used certain
conserved quantities (mass, energy, variance, etc.) to obtain precise results on the dynamical
behaviour of solutions. Apart from this, few nonstandard frameworks have been developed (see,
for example, [5], for a theory on Zhidkov spaces).
Here, we shall introduce new functional spaces and study local well-posedness, global existence
and stability (in a way that will be clear further ahead). These spaces do not lie within L2pR2q:
in fact, the ﬁrst one will lie in L8pR2q, but not in LppR2q, for any p ă 8; the second will lie in

1

L4pR2q X L8pR2q, but not in LppR2q, p ă 4. The most simple example of these spaces appeared
for the ﬁrst time in a previous work, [4], in the context of the hyperbolic nonlinear Schrödinger
equation. We shall generalize the results of [4] in the context of the (NLS) for two reasons: to
our knowledge, there are no results of this type for (NLS); secondly, even though one may prove
similar results for more general equations, that would increase needlessly the complexity of the
exposition and deviate the attention of the reader from the essential ideas.
The ﬁrst step is to take any c P R and consider solutions of (NLS) of the form upt, x, yq “
fpt, x ´ cyq (we call these solutions spatial plane waves: the number c is the speed and the
function f is the proﬁle of the wave). Introducing this ansatz, one arrives to

ift ` p1 ` c2qfzz ` λ|f|σf “ 0,

which one may solve using the standard H 1 theory. It is clear that spatial plane waves are not
Lp solutions of (NLS), for any p ă 8, even though they lie in L1
locpR2q. Based on these solutions,
consider the space of spatial plane waves

(
locpR2q : Df P H 1pRq : upx, yq “ fpx ´ cyq a.e.

.

(cid:32)
u P L1

Xc “

Then the initial value problem for (NLS) is well-posed over Xc, simply because the problem
reduces to the local theory in one spatial dimension. Now consider

E “ H 1pR2q ‘ Xc.

Notice that, due to the lack of decay of elements in Xc, the sum is indeed a direct sum. Then
the initial value problem for u0 “ v0 ` φ0 P E can be proven to be equivalent to the initial value
problem for the system

$’’&’’% ivt ` vxx ` vyy ` λ|v ` φ|σpv ` φq ´ λ|φ|σφ “ 0, φpt, x, yq “ fpt, x ´ cyq

vp0q “ v0
ift ` p1 ` c2qfzz ` λ|f|σf “ 0
fp0q “ f0

where f0 is the proﬁle of φ0. Notice that the second equation is independent on v. This means
that one may solve it and introduce the solution onto the ﬁrst equation. Thus, to prove local
well-posedness on E, it suﬃces to show an H 1 local well-posedness result for the ﬁrst equation.
This is achieved by making the crucial observation that the nonlinear terms lie in H´1 (even
though they involve φ).

With such a local well-posedness result, consider the following situation: take a spatial plane
wave φ with initial data φ0, and assume φ is globally deﬁned. If one introduces an H 1 perturba-
tion on the initial data, φ0 ` v0, the corresponding solution is given by u “ φ` v (since φ only
depends on the plane wave part of the initial data). Then a natural question is the following:

Stability problem: if  is suﬃciently small, does u stay close to φ?

This question corresponds to a global existence result for v that insures that v stays small for
all times. Results of such nature are indeed valid for (NLS) in H 1 (see [2], [7], [8], [10], [11]) in
the L2-supercritical case. Here, however, the question is not that clear: ﬁrst, if one develops the
nonlinear terms in the equation for v, one sees that lower order terms in v are present; second,
the plane wave component φ, which even has "inﬁnite mass" and "inﬁnite energy" (due to the
lack of integrability) might act as a forcing term, pushing v to grow indeﬁnitely. In [4], such a
result was proven for σ an even power greater or equal to 4, in the context of the hyperbolic
nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

endowed with the induced norm (which, as we will check, is well-deﬁned). As before, we look for
a local well-posedness result in

The equations for the proﬁles fn are solved using the H 2pRq local well-posedness result (here,
one must be careful to ensure that all proﬁles exist up to some time T ą 0). Once again, it
remains to prove that one may solve the equation for v in H 1pR2q, which amounts to check
that the nonlinear terms are in H´1pR2q. Under the additional hypothesis σ ě 1, this can be
shown to be true: heuristically, if one develops the nonlinear terms, one obtains some terms with
v, which are well-behaved, and some products of diferent φn’s. Remarkably, these terms lie in

We now arrive to the last generalization, more complex and with interesting properties. The
idea is simply to pass from a discrete sum of plane waves to an integration over a continuum of

(1.1)

Before we study the initial value problem for (NLS) in this context, we shall study some very
interesting properties related to the plane wave transform. Among them, one may prove that:
• T f P LppR2q, p ě 2 under suitable conditions on f (Proposition 3.2 and Corollary 3.9);
• T f R L2pR2q if f P C0pR2q is positive (Corollary 3.3);
• The convolution of two functions, the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform may
be obtained using the plane wave transform transform (Corollary 3.11 and Examples 4.3
and 4.4);

• Several classical linear equations, such as the heat equation, the Schrödinger equation and

the wave equation, may be solved by means of this transform (Section 4).

Remark 1.1. One should regard all the previous deﬁnitions in analogy to the Fourier series
and transform: one starts with a simple periodic function with a given frequency, superposes
a numerable family of functions with diﬀerent frequencies to arrive to the Fourier series and
passes to the continuous case to obtain the Fourier transform, where one also has the concepts
of physical and frequency variables.

Evidently, our construction is not the same as the Fourier one and many properties will
diﬀer. One aspect is that, while the Fourier construction makes all sense in one variable (and its
multidimensional version is simply the application of the one-dimensional case to each variable),

4

the plane wave construction needs (at least) a two-dimensional setting. In another perspective,
the Fourier transform is based on the solutions of the ODE
u2pxq ` k2upxq “ 0,

while the plane wave theory is based on solutions of the transport equation

uypx, yq ` cuxpx, yq “ 0.

With this new transform in hand, we try to obtain some results in the spirit of the numerable
case. That is, look for local well-posedness and stability results in E “ H 1pR2q ` X. The main
diﬀerence is that now the (NLS) may be decoupled into

$’’&’’% ivt ` vxx ` vyy ` λ|v ` φ|σpv ` φq “ 0

vp0q “ v0
iφt ` φxx ` φyy “ 0
φp0q “ φ0

.

Surprisingly, when one passes to the continuous case, there exists a decoupling such that the
equation for the plane wave component is linear. We now state our main results.
Theorem 1.3. Fix σ ě 1 and u0 P E. Then there exists a unique maximal solution u P
Cpr0, Tq, Eq of (NLS) (cf. deﬁnition 5.3) such that up0q “ u0. The solution depends continuously
on the initial data. Furthermore, if T ă 8, then
}uptq}E Ñ 8,

t Ñ T.

Theorem 1.4. Set σ ě 4 even. Given M ą 1, there exist pMq ą 0 and δ “ δp, Mq, with
δp, Mq Ñ 0 as  Ñ 0, such that, if φ0 “ T f0 P X and v0 P H 1pR2q satisfy

then the solution u of (NLS) with initial data v0 ` φ0 is globally deﬁned. Moreover, if S2 is the
free Schrödinger group in dimension two,

}u ´ S2φ0}L8pp0,8q,H 1pR2qq ď δp, Mq

As a consequence of Theorem 1.4, we have

Theorem 1.5. Set σ ě 4 even. For any given K ą 0 and M ą 1, there exists φ0 P X X H 1pR2q
satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.4 and

}u ´ S2φ0}L8pp0,8q,H 1pR2q ď δppMq, Mq.

5

Remark 1.2. The global H 1 solutions given by Theorem 1.5 have small Lσ`2 norm, since this
norm is controlled by }v0}H 1 ` }φ0}X. Therefore the energy of these solutions will always be
positive and so there is no possible contradiction with the usual Virial blowup result by Glassey
[6].

Finally, we present a global well-posedness result for σ “ 1.

Theorem 1.6. Fix σ “ 1. Consider u0 “ v0 ` φ0, v0 P H 1pR2q, φ0 “ T f0 P X. Assume that

Then there exists a unique global solution u P Cpr0,8q, Eq of (NLS) with initial data u0.

We now outline the structure of the paper. Section 2 will be devoted to the study of the
numerable superposition of plane waves and Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are proved therein. In section
3, we recall the plane wave transform (1.1), construct a suitable functional framework in which
one may consider such a transform, and prove several properties.
In section 4, we apply the
transform to solve some classic linear PDE’s. In section 5, we apply the theory for the transform
to obtain Theorems 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. We conclude with some remarks and, in the appendix,
we give an alternate proof of the injectivity of the plane wave transform.
Notation. We ﬁx some notations. We deﬁne the space of Schwarz funtions, SpR2q, and the
space of distributions, D1pR2q. We denote by F˚ the Fourier transform with respect to the ˚
variables. Integration spaces will often be indexed with the variable that is being integrated:
cpR, L2
zpRqq will denote the space of integrable functions in c P R with values in L2pRq, where
L1
the variable is z. Furthermore, if no confusion can arise, we omit the domain in the notation of
the integration space.

ivt ` vxx ` vyy ` λ|v ` φ|σpv ` φq ´ λg “ ´piφt ` φxx ` φyy ` λgq

Since the left hand side is in H´1pR2q and the right hand side is in X1

must be equal to zero: $’’&’’% ivt ` vxx ` vyy ` λ|v ` φ|σpv ` φq ´ λg “ 0

vp0q “ v0

.

c, by lemma 2.2, both sides

Furthermore, by lemma 2.1, the second equation is equivalent to the inﬁnite system (2.3), which
proves the claim.

Step 2. We solve the inﬁnite system (2.3). For each n P N, deﬁne

Then

Since pp1 ` c2

Now consider the initial value problem

nq3{4}pf0qn}H 2.

iphnqt ` phnqzz ` λ|hn|σhn “ 0, hnp0q “ phnq0.

It follows from the H 2 local well-posedness results for (NLS) that there exists a time Tn and
a unique maximal solution hn P Cpr0, Tnq, H 2pRqq X C 1pr0, Tnq, L2pRqq of the above problem.
Moreover, since }hnp0q}H 2 Ñ 0, for n ě n0 suﬃciently large, Tn ě T1. Deﬁne the common time
of existence,

Then each hn is deﬁne on r0, T8q. If T8 ă 8, then, as t Ñ T8,
}hnptq}H 2 Ñ 8, for some n P N.

Step 3. We now solve (2.2). By Lemma 2.3 and Kato’s local well-posedness result in H 1pR2q,
(2.2) has a unique maximal solution v, deﬁned on r0, Tvq, Tv ď T8, with initial condition v0.
Furthermore, if Tv ă T8,
Step 4. Conclusion. It follows from the previous steps that u “ v ` φ is the unique solution of
(NLS) on E, with initial data u0. If Tv ă 8, then either Tv ă T8 or T8 ă 8. In any case,

Proof. Since f ı 0 and f ě 0, there exists a ą 0 and a square Q Ă R2 such that f ě a1Q,
which implies that T f ě aT 1Q. Using the translation and scaling properties, one may write the
transform of 1Q in terms of T 1r0,1s2, which does not belong to L2pR2q.
Example 3.2. Consider f “ 1r0,1s2 ´ 1r0,1sˆr1,2s. Then, using the expression for T 1r0,1s2 and
the translation property, it is easy to check that T f P L2pR2q.

4 Solving some linear PDE’s using the plane wave transform

In this short section, we apply the plane wave transform to solve some classical equations.
Example 4.1 (The wave equation). Consider the wave equation in R2

utt ´ uxx ´ uyy “ 0.

21

If one supposes that upx, y, tq “ fpt, x ´ cyq, one arrives to

one obtains a solution of the 2D wave equation. We remark that, unlike Poisson’s formula for
classical solutions, this representation does not involve derivatives of f1.
Example 4.2 (The Schrödinger equation). Take the linear Schrödinger equation:

The solution is given by

iut ` uxx ` uyy “ 0.
Introducing the plane wave ansatz upx, y, tq “ fpt, x ´ cyq,
ift ` p1 ` c2qfzz “ 0.

4p1`c2qt f0pw, cqdwdc.

which, through the plane wave transform, gives a family of solutions to the two dimensional
Schrödinger equation.

Example 4.3 (The heat equation). We now consider a slightly diﬀerent application of the plane
wave transform. Take the heat equation in one dimension:

ut “ uxx.

Here, instead of taking a plane wave in two spatial dimensions, we consider a plane wave in time
and space. The ansatz upt, xq “ fpx ´ ctq implies that

´cf1 “ f2, i.e., fpz, cq “ Apcqe´cz ` Bpcq.

Setting Bpcq “ 0 and applying the transform T , one arrives to the following family of solutions
to the heat equation:

upt, xq “

Apcqe´cx`c2tdc.

ż

22

Actually, if one is given an initial condition up0, xq “ u0pxq, then one observes that A is the inverse
Laplace transform of u0. Although this integral representation is certainly valid, the presence
of the term e´cx implies a strong decay of A at inﬁnity. Now, if one replaces c with ic in the
integral representation, one still obtains a solution to the heat equation. This procedure makes
no sense when one starts with the ansatz upt, xq “ fpx´ ctq; however, the integral representation
is still meaningful for complex values of c. Hence another family of solutions is

which is precisely the solution of the heat equation given by the Fourier transform. This integral
representation was studied in [3] as a generalization of the Fourier transform.
Example 4.4 (The Schrödinger equation II). As in the previous example, one may derive a
family of solutions to the 1D-Schrödinger equation using T in both space and time:

upt, xq “

Apcqe´icx`ic2tdc.

Givan an initial condition u0, A corresponds to the Fourier transform of u0. The substitution
c ÞÑ ´ic gives the family

upt, xq “
which is connected to the Laplace transform.

˜Apcqe´cx´ic2tdc

We ﬁnish with a result stating that the above classical arguments to reduce the dimension
of the equations are valid in a functional setting. The result, although stated only for the linear
Schrödinger equation, may also be extended to more equations.

Proposition 4.1. Let S1 and S2 be the free Schrödinger groups in dimensions one and two,
respectively. Given f P L1

Proof. Suppose that f P SpR2q. Then, from the formula of Proposition 3.4,

Lemma 5.1. The semi-norm }¨}E is a norm in E. Moreover, pE,}¨}Eq is a Banach space and

Taking the inﬁmum on the right hand side,

}u}L4 À }u}E.

Hence, if }u}E “ 0, u “ 0, which proves that } ¨ }E is a norm. We now prove that E, with the
norm } ¨ }E, is complete. Given punqnPN Ă E, suppose that

}un ´ um}E Ñ 0, n, m Ñ 8.

For each k P N, there exist npkq ď mpkq, increasing with k, such that

This implies that pvkqkPN and pφkqkPN are Cauchy sequences in H 1pR2q and X, respectively, and
so

vk Ñ v in H 1pR2q, φk Ñ φ in X.

Hence

and so ˜uk Ñ v ` φ in E. Since punqnPN is Cauchy in E, this implies that un Ñ v ` φ.

By the previous lemma, the nonlinear term is in H´1pR2q. It follows from Kato’s local existence

v P Cpr0, Ts, H 1pR2qq solution of (5.2), which depends continuously on v0 and φ0. Setting
uptq “ vptq ` φptq, 0 ď t ă T , it becomes clear that u is a solution in E of (NLS). Moreover, it
is unique, by lemma 5.4.

Tmax “ suptT ą 0 : there exists u P Cpr0, Ts, Eq solution of (NLS), up0q “ u0u.

If, for some M ą 0, }uptq}E ă M as t Ñ Tmax, then, for each t, one may ﬁnd ˜vptq P H 1pR2q and
˜φptq P X such that

}˜vptq}H 1 ` } ˜φptq}X ď }uptq}E ` M ă 2M,

uptq “ ˜vptq ` ˜φptq.

For t0 suﬃciently close to Tmax,

T :“ Tp}˜vpt0q}H 1,} ˜φpt0q}Xq ą Tmax ´ t0.

Then one may solve (5.2) with initial data v0 “ ˜vpt0q and φ0 “ ˜φpt0q, thus obtaining a unique
solution of (NLS) deﬁned on rTmax ´ t0, Ts. This implies that u is extendible beyond Tmax, a
contradiction. Hence there exists a unique maximal solution u P Cpr0, Tmaxq, Eq of (NLS) and,
if Tmax ă 8,

6 Further comments

The plane wave transform has many interesting properties. Section 4 should be regarded as a
starting point for the application of this transform to obtain new local well-posedness results
for equations such as the wave equation, the heat equation and KdV equation. Furthermore,

29

Theorem 1.5 points out that this theory is not simply an appendix to the usual H s local well-
posedness theory: it gives new information about H s solutions and may shine some new light on
global existence criteria for these equations.

It is important to recall that the plane transform is built upon solutions of the transport

equation. Other equations may give birth to other transforms: for example, consider

ω ¨ ∇u “ iu,

u “ upx, yq, ω “ pω1, ω2q P R2, |ω| “ 1.

Solutions of this equation are of the form upx, yq “ eiω¨px,yqfpωK ¨ px, yqq, ωK “ p´ω2, ω1q, that
is, functions that are periodic in the ω direction. By varying the direction of ω, we may arrive
to a similar construction to that of the transform T . It would be especially important to ﬁnd a
construction which can be applied to other spatial domains.

One may also try to extend the plane wave transform to more spatial variables, either by
applying only to the two ﬁrst variables or by iteration (applying to the ﬁrst and to the i-th
variable). The functional tools of section 3 should be easily applicable to either extension.

A Appendix

In this appendix, we give another proof of

T f ” 0 ñ f ” 0.

This proof is based on arguments that do not involve the expression of T in terms of the Fourier
transform. For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume that f is good enough so that all integra-
tions are automatically justiﬁed.

Since, for any k,

it follows that

Set Sprq “ lim SNprq. By Monotone Convergence Theorem, the functions f`S and ´f´S are
integrable, positive and have integral over r0,8q equal to 0. Hence f`S, f´S ” 0. It follows
from (A.2) and (A.3) that f`prq, f´prq “ 0 for r ą a. Since a ą 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that
˜f ” 0.
˜f ” 0, it follows that fp0, 0q “ 0. To prove that fpz0, c0q “ 0 for any pz0, c0q P R2, consider

Step 3. Conclusion. Since ˜f is the average of f over any circle centered at the origin and

fpz0,c0qpz, cq “ fpz ` z0, c ` c0q.

Then T fpz0,c0q ” 0 and therefore, by the previous steps, fpz0, c0q “ fpz0,c0qp0, 0q “ 0.
Remark A.1. It follows directly from this proof that the integral of f over the collection of all
strips in R2 determines uniquely the values of f. This implies that the integral of f over all strips
determines the integral of f over all balls. This is not trivial at all, since the value of the latter
cannot be obtained from the ﬁrst ones using algebraic set relations. Furthermore, it is easy to
check that, if one starts with a collection of strips with a ﬁnite number of possible directions,
such a result is no longer valid.
