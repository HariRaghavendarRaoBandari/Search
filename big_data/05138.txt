We study the excitonic coupling and homogeneous spectral line width of brick layer J-aggregate
ﬁlms. We begin by analysing the structural information revealed by the two-exciton states probed in
two-dimensional spectra. Our ﬁrst main result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings
and the spectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is diﬀerent (larger shift for the same near-
est neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure, which leads to an estimation of
dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices. We next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous
broadening - population relaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in
linear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure dephasing dominates
the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover temperature, which explains the linear
temperature dependence of the homogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased
density of states at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the con-
tribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are suggested to directly
measure the lifetime of the bright state and can therefore support the proposed model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Organic molecules are promising candidates for the
next generation of electronic devices and for solar energy
conversion.1–6 Among these, assemblies of dye molecules
in the form of J-aggregates have attracted attention for
their special optical properties.7,8 These are understood
from delocalization of the exciton formed upon the ab-
sorption of light over tens to hundreds of monomers.9
Because the dominant resonant transfer interactions be-
tween molecules are negative in a J-aggregate, the op-
tically bright state is found at the bottom of the band,
leading to a redshift of the absorption peak compared to
a single chromophore. Other properties resulting from
this exciton delocalization are superradiance and a hid-
den level structure at the band edge.10,11 The exciton de-
localization in linear aggregates is reﬂected in the pump-
probe spectrum12,13 and in the two-dimensional optical
spectrum.14

Most early studies focused on J-aggregates for which
the optical properties can be explained with a model
of a linear aggregate, which self-assemble in solution
and are often studied at low temperature in a glass
environment.15 Over the past years there has been an
intense interest in tubular J-aggregates.16–22 It is also
possible to manufacture two-dimensional thin ﬁlm J-
aggregates of chromophore molecules, which were found
to exhibit a redshift in the absorption.23,24 Nonlinear op-
tical experiments produced a two-dimensional spectrum
similar to the spectrum of a linear aggregate, consisting
of a single pair of positive and negative peaks.23

In order to analyse these ﬁndings, a model of a
truly two-dimensional aggregate must be used,25,26 which
goes beyond weakly coupled linear aggregates.27 In gen-

eral, the transfer interactions between molecules depend
strongly on their relative orientation. This means that
the absorption spectrum is sensitive to the details of the
molecular arrangement. Therefore, modeling of the spec-
trum can help in determining the structure. This is par-
ticularly helpful in cases where the structure is not known
from other measurements.23

It is clear from experiment, as well as from consid-
eration of the molecular structure, that the excitons in
J-aggregates must couple to their environment. This
coupling leads to scattering between exciton states and
to pure dephasing. The total dephasing process can be
studied by measuring the homogeneous line width in ex-
periments such as photon echos, hole burning or two-
dimensional spectroscopy. In particular, the dependence
of the homogeneous line width on temperature can be
analysed in order to understand the exciton phonon cou-
pling mechanism. Understanding the interaction with
the environment is also important to assess how many
molecules in the aggregate are entangled upon optical ex-
citation. This entanglement, or delocalization, is the key
quantity that causes the interesting properties of these
systems. However, interactions with phonons limit the
localization size, and determining this quantity as a func-
tion of temperature is an important goal.
It has been
shown that the energy dependent localization size can be
extracted from two-dimensional spectra.28

Studies of the homogeneous line width have been per-
formed on J-aggregates for which linear chain models ex-
plain the optical properties. Fidder et al.29 measured the
homogeneous width in PIC-Br for temperatures between
1.5 and 190 K. The temperature dependence is clearly
nonlinear and was modeled by coupling of the excitons
to three harmonic modes with frequencies of 9 cm−1, 305

cm−1 and 973 cm−1. Hirschmann and Friedrich30 mea-
sured the homogeneous line width in PIC-I for tempera-
tures from 0.35 K to 80 K. The temperature dependence
can be ﬁtted by a sum of two exponentials or be explained
by a theory that predicts a power law dependence.31
The homogeneous line shape is well approximated by a
Lorentzian for all temperatures.

In contrast to this work, experiments on thin ﬁlms
using two-dimensional optical spectroscopy have found
a linear scaling of the homogeneous line width with
temperature.23 This suggests that a diﬀerent mechanism
is responsible for the line width.

In this work, we use an excitonic model of two-
dimensional brick layer J-aggregates and study the ho-
mogeneous line width as a function of temperature. Our
theoretical model is presented in Section II and the re-
sults are presented in Section III. Speciﬁcally, we pre-
dict the excitonic coupling in molecular aggregates and
thus correlate two-dimensional spectra with molecular ar-
rangements. These calculations are the topic of Sections
IIIA, B, and C. Then we consider population relaxation
and the exciton lifetime n Sec.
IIID and calculate the
homogeneous line width as a function of temperature in
Section IIIE. Finally, we analyse experimental measure-
ments in Sec. IV and conclude in Section V. In the ap-
pendix, we consider alternative aggregate geometries.

II. MODEL

The usual Frenkel exciton model of J-aggregates starts
from a single bright optical transition on each molecule.
The Hamitonian includes a term which describes local
excitation of a molecule with an excitation energy ǫn and
a term for the coherent exciton motion from one molecule
to the other, and is given in terms of the Pauli creation
and annihilation operators c† and c by

HS = Xn

ǫnc†

ncn + Xnm

Jnmc†

ncm.

(1)

In this Hamiltonian, the sums run over all molecules in
the aggregate. If the molecules are far enough apart, the
electrostatic interaction between them can be approxi-
mated by dipole dipole coupling, which gives

Jnm = C

µn · µm − 3(µn · ˆrnm)(µm · ˆrnm)

r3
nm

.

(2)

Here, µn is the transition dipole vector of molecule n,
~rnm = ~rn−~rm is the relative position vector, rnm = |~rnm|
is the distance and ˆrnm = ~rnm/rnm. C is a constant that
scales the magnitude of the coupling and includes possi-
ble rescaling eﬀects due to vibrations.32 Here, we will use
transition dipole coupling for all pairs of molecules. For
nearest neigbours, a better understanding of the coupling
can be obtained from quantum chemical calculations.33,34
Each molecule in the aggregate is inﬂuenced by a dif-
ferent local environment. This leads to static disorder in

2

the site energies ǫn, which are diﬀerent for each aggregate
in the ensemble. This, in turn, leads to localization and
a distribution of eﬀective sizes of the exciton. Further-
more, the excitons in the aggregate interact with phonons
in the surrounding material. Their dynamic eﬀect is usu-
ally modeled as a reservoir of harmonic oscillators, which
are described by the bath Hamiltonian HB. The interac-
tion of these oscillators with the electronic excitations is
assumed to be

HSB = Xn

Xnc†

ncn,

(3)

where the eﬀective bath coordinate is to be thought of as
the sum of couplings to individual bath modes, which can

be written as Xn = −Pα gnαxα. Here, xα denote the

coordinates of the bath modes, while gnα are their cou-
pling constants to the system. The linear dependence on
the bath coordinate can be thought of as a lowest order
expansion in the coordinate. The properties of the sys-
tem bath interactions are determined by the correlation
functions hXn(t)Xm(0)i. We will make the usual but not
completely general assumption that the ﬂuctuations on
each site are uncorrelated and that their correlation func-
tion is the same on each site, hXn(t)Xm(0)i = δnmL(t).
The system Hamiltonian (for each realization of the
static disorder) can be diagonalized to give the exciton
states φk, which we choose to be real, and energies Ek,
kck. The wave functions relate

(5)

In modiﬁed Redﬁeld theory35,36, the diagonal ﬂuctu-
ations are treated exactly, while the oﬀ-diagonal ﬂuctu-
ations are included in second order perturbation theory.
The zero order Hamiltonian HS + H (0)
SB + HB does not
couple the exciton states. Therefore, the absorption spec-
trum for this Hamiltonian is simply the sum of contribu-
tions from each exciton state.
In this case, where the
system Hamiltonian commutes with the system bath in-
teraction, the linear and nonlinear response functions can
be calculated analytically with the cumulant expansion.
For the linear absorption in the time domain, we ﬁnd

A(0)(t) = Xk

|µk|2e−iEkt−gk(t),

(6)

where µk is the transition dipole from the ground state
to exciton state k. The spectrum A(0)(ω) is given as the

Fourier transform of A(0)(t). The line shape function for
each exciton state is given by gk(t) = g(t)/Nk, where
kn is the inverse participation ratio35. The

line shape function for a single site is deﬁned as

Nk = 1/Pn φ4

If the harmonic bath is interpreted in the continuum
limit, the correlation function can be expressed in terms
of the spectral density J(ω) (although, in principle, the
spectral density can also contain delta functions which
describe discrete modes). The quantum correlation func-
tion L(t) is given in terms of the spectral density by the
expression

L(t) =

(8)

The homogeneous line width, which can be measured
in photon echos or two-dimensional spectra can now be
explained by two broadening mechanisms. First, there is
the pure dephasing contribution contained in Eq. 6. Sec-
ond, there will be a contribution from H ′
SB. In second
order perturbation theory with the Markov and secular
approximations, this term will lead to dephasing given
as the sum of population relaxation rates. This contribu-
tion can be termed dephasing from population relaxation.
The perturbative treatment of H ′
SB, which is known from
experiment to be weak in certain linear J-aggregates,31
leads to scattering between exciton eigenstates. The scat-
tering rate between eigenstate q and k is given by

Wkq = Xn

φ2
knφ2

qnJ(|ωkq|)n(ωkq),

(9)

where the sum runs over all molecules in the aggre-
gate, ωkq = Ek − Eq, J is the spectral density and
n(ωkq) = ¯n(ωkq) for ωkq > 0 and n(ωkq) = ¯n(−ωkq) + 1
for ωkq < 0, with ¯n(ω) = (exp(ω/kT ) − 1)−1 the Bose
Einstein distribution. The resulting dephasing rate of
exciton state k is given by Γk = (1/2)Pq6=k Wqk. Then,

the homogenous absorption line with both pure dephas-
ing and dephasing from population relaxation is given
by

A(t) = Xk

|µk|2e−iEkt−gk(t)−Γkt

(10)

Note that we neglect the radiative life time in this ex-
pression, which normally gives a negligible contribution
to the linewidth. Also, in this work we do not include
an ensemble of localization sizes causes by the presence
of static disorder. Finally, it should be observed that the
homogeneous line width is not equal to the sum of de-
phasing rates if multiple transitions overlap in the spec-
trum.

III. RESULTS

A. Molecular arrangement and resonant transfer

interactions

We assume that the molecules are placed on a brick
layer lattice25,26 with aspect ratio A and slip s, see ﬁgure
1. The grid has Nx molecules in the x-direction and Ny
in the y-direction. These sizes should not be interpreted
as the physical size of the aggregate, but as the number
of molecules over which an exciton is delocalized. Dif-
ferent geometries can then be obtained by varying the
slip, while we assume a constant aspect ratio of A = 2,
which is a reasonable number for molecules typically used
to form thin ﬁlms. Note that with this choice, a slip of
1.0 (half a unit cell) corresponds to a square lattice with
dipoles oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the lattice
vectors. We note that, for the small aggregates consid-
ered in this paper, the choice of boundary conditions is
important. We limit our study to the boundary condi-
tions shown in Fig. 1. In the appendix, we consider the
value of A = 3. Other arrangements, for example her-
ringbone structures with two molecules per unit cell, are
outside the scope of this paper. For a constant prefac-
tor C the magnitude of the couplings will change with s.
This is shown in ﬁgure 1. We deﬁne the nearest neighbour
coupling in the x-direction as J. Note that we include all
long range couplings in our model as well, and that we
don’t use periodic boundary conditions.

In ﬁgure 1 we observe that the values of s for which
an aggregate with negative couplings in both directions
is formed are quite limited. In most cases, the coupling
in the vertical direction is positive. Because of this com-
bination of negative and positive interactions, the sys-
tem is not a perfect J-aggregate, in the sense that the
bright state is not necessarily at the bottom of the band.
We will see that this has observable consequences for the
two-dimensional optical spectrum. Negative couplings in
both the x and y directions are found around s = 1.0,
which is the structure close to the one assumed in exper-
imental work on brick layer PTCDA aggregates.24

In ﬁgure 2 we plot the density of states for a linear
aggregate and several two-dimensional aggregates. For
each geometry, we scale the parameter J (or, equivalently
C), to obtain a shift of approximately 2500 cm−1 of the
aggregate absorption peak with respect to the absorption
peak of the monomer. This choice is made to stay close
to the interpretation of experimental results, in which
the spectral shift upon aggregation can be measured, but
the structure of the aggregate (i.e. a two-dimensional
bricklayer lattice or a collection of semi-one-dimensional
chains) is not always a priori known. In particular, we
are interested in comparing with experimental data on
BIC aggregates studied in Ref. 23, where this shift was
observed to be around 2500 cm−1. In order to obtain this
shift, we set J = −1050 cm−1 for the linear aggregate,
J = −903 cm−1 for s = 0.5, J = −472 cm−1 for s = 0.75
and J = −416 cm−1 for s = 1.0. We note that, because of

by the arrow). Bottom: Coupling between molecules above each other to the right (solid) and left (dashed) as a function of
the slip. Note that for a slip of 1.0 (half the unit cell) both couplings are negative, leading to J-coupling for all three nearest
neighbours. The aspect ratio is A = 2 and parameters are chosen such that the coupling in the horizontal direction is kept
constant at J = −511cm−1.

diﬀerences in the electrostatic environment, the shift does
not necessarily directly reﬂect the excitonic coupling.
In the linear case, we observe a strong increase of the
density at the band edge, reﬂecting the 1/√E scaling
in the case of an inﬁnite chain.37 The two-dimensional
aggregate with s = 0.5 mirrors this behaviour, but has
additional states at lower energy. For larger values of s,
however, the density of states decreases with decreasing
energy, in line with the expected constant behaviour in
the limit of an inﬁnite sheet.37 We note that the diﬀerence
in density of states between a linear and two-dimensional
aggregate is quite dramatic. For example, for the energy
gap between the two lowest-lying states, we ﬁnd 9.2 cm−1
in a 25x25 lattice (s = 1.0, J = −416 cm−1), while it
is only 0.45 cm−1 in a linear chain with 625 molecules
(J = −1050 cm−1).
(Note that we include long range
interactions in the simulations leading to this number.)

B. Two-dimensional spectra

We now turn our attention to the linear and two-
dimensional optical spectra for this model system. For all
models the simulation predicts a dominant bright peak in
the linear absorption spectra, which, by construction lies
about 2500 cm−1 below the monomer absorption peak.
However, we ﬁnd that s = 0.5 and s = 1.0 are clearly dis-
tinguishable when the two-dimensional correlation spec-
trum is considered.

Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy is a third-order
nonlinear optical technique which correlates the evolution
of the electronic state of the system during two time peri-
ods, called t1 and t3.38 The signal is plotted as a function
of the Fourier transforms of these two time periods, with
frequencies labeled ω1 and ω3. The technique can be used
to separate homogeneous broadening, which shows up as
the anti-diagonal width of peaks in the two-dimensional
plot, from inhomogeneous broadening, which contributes
to the diagonal width.
It therefore provides a tool to
measure the homogeneous line width. When one looks at
the real value of a two-dimensional spectrum, both neg-
ative peaks, colored in blue, and positive peaks, colored
in red, are present. Blue peaks arise from interactions
where one excitation is created, while red peaks corre-
spond to processes where, during t3, coherences between
one- and two-quantum states (in which two excitation
quanta are present in the system) are present. Positive
peaks are blue shifted with respect to negative peaks as a
consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. The verti-
cal distance between positive and negative peaks can be
used as a ruler from which the exciton localization size
can be determined.

We calculated two-dimensional optical spectra using
the sum over states method,39 assuming only homoge-
neous broadening. This simple method will give a good
idea of the peak positions and relative intensities, but not
of the details of the line shape. Note that in the calcula-
tion of the spectra, we have chosen to vary J in order to

FIG. 2: Density of states for a linear (N = 625) and various two-dimensional (Nx = Ny = 25) aggregates. The bright state is

this number of molecules. The width of the bins is 200 cm−1.

obtain similar peak positions for all values of s consid-
ered. The reason for this choice is that J is not known a
priori in experiment, but the spectral shift with respect
to the monomer can be measured. In our spectra, in the
case s = 0.5, because of the presence of both positive
and negative couplings in the system, the bright state is
not at the bottom of the band. Because of the Pauli ex-
clusion principle, two excitons cannot populate the same
state.13,40 Induced absorption peaks will show up at lower
ω3 than the bleaching and stimulated emission peak.
This is most easily understood in the simpliﬁed case of a
linear aggregate with nearest neighbor interactions only,
for which the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized analyti-
cally using a Jordan-Wigner transformation.41 The two-
exciton states are then given as anti-symmetric products
of one-exciton states. Because the ”ﬁrst” exciton is not
at the bottom of the band, the ”second” exciton can go
to a lower energy than the ﬁrst one. This leads to the
induced absorption peak. Although this picture of two in-
dependent excitons is not strictly valid when long-range
interactions are taken into account, the result that an
extra induced absorption peak appears at low ω3 is also
found numerically in the full calculation (see Fig. 3).

Note that for a linear aggregate the induced absorp-
tion peak is weaker than the bleaching and stimulated
emission peak, while the two have approximately equal
amplitude for the 2D lattice with s = 1.0. Both of these
systems have the state with largest oscillator strength at
the bottom of the band. The presence of a large coupling
in the y-direction makes the 2D lattice diﬀerent from a
product of one-dimensional aggregates, as considered in
Arias et al.23 We will see that the diﬀerence is crucial for

a correct determination of the couplings in the system.
In this case the bright state is at the bottom of the band,
and the two-dimensional spectrum shows a dominant pair
of a positive and a negative peak (see Fig. 3). Because
the occurrence of positive and negative peaks and their
relative intensities in this spectrum are close to the ob-
served spectrum for BIC aggregates,23 this ﬁnding lends
support to the model with a slip around s = 0.75 − 1.0
for this system. Finally, we note that in the 2D lattice
spectrum, a cross peak due to ﬁnite size eﬀects is just
visible to the right of the main peak.

C. Estimating the nearest neighbour couplings

We now consider the diﬀerence between a linear (N2x1)
and a brick layer (NxN) aggregate. In both cases, a dom-
inant pair of positive and negative peaks is found in the
2D spectrum.23,42

The relation between the nearest neighbor coupling
and the peak shift of the aggregate compared to the
monomer, which can be measured by ﬁnding the max-
imum in the linear spectra,
is diﬀerent. This simple
method, which relies on the fact that excitonic coupling
shifts the peak, is frequently used to determine the cou-
pling from experimentally obtained spectra, even though
it neglects the shift in the single molecule transition fre-
quency due to the electrostatic eﬀect of the diﬀerent envi-
ronment in both cases. The diﬀerence is easily explained
from the fact that there are more neighbors and that
there is therefore more coupling in the 2D aggregate.

echo spectrum of (a) a linear J-aggregate with 36 molecules
and of (b-d) various two-dimensional J-aggregates with a brick
layer structure of 6x6 molecules. The slip = (b) 0.5, (c)
0.75 and (d) 1.0. Homogeneous broadening with a single
Lorentzian line width is assumed and all contours are scaled
to the amplitude in the spectrum of the linear aggregate. Neg-
ative (bleaching and stimulated emission) peaks are plotted
in blue, while positive (induced absorption) peaks are plotted
in red and yellow. Contours are at the same absolute level in
all panels, and were drawn at -50, -40, -30, -20, 20, 30, 40 and
50 percent of the maximum amplitude of the spectrum of the
linear aggregate.

Quantitatively, the peak shift in a linear aggregate is 2.4
times the nearest neighbor coupling.15 In the 2D system
with s = 1.0, we ﬁnd that the shift is several times larger
(4.9J for a 6x6 bricklayer lattice). Thus, while estimat-
ing the couplings from the spectral shift, it is important
to take the aggregate geometry into account. Here, we
established the rule that can be used to estimate the
coupling in a two-dimensional brick layer aggregate from
the measured linear absorption spectrum for parameters
s = 1, A = 2. For other parameters a similar rule can be
established, which will, in general, be diﬀerent from the
rule derived from calculations on linear aggregates. We
note that the magnitude of the couplings and, therefore,
spectral shifts strongly depend on the aggregate under
study. In particular, in Ref. 24 much smaller couplings
were found than in Ref. 23. However, the relation be-
tween spectral shift and coupling does not depend on
the absolute value of these numbers. We note that the
practical rule described here is related to well established
results derived from sum rules.43

D. Population relaxation

We next consider the life time of the bright state, which
for both the linear aggregate and the brick layer lat-
tice with A = 2 and s = 1.0 lies at the bottom of the
band. This life time can be measured experimentally
using pump-probe spectroscopy. For the well studied
system of linear aggregates in a glass, the temperature
dependence of the life time of this state is mostly deter-
mined by scattering to higher states with the absorption
of phonons. The dephasing associated with population
relaxation is found to dominate, leading to a T 3.5 de-
pendence of the homogeneous line width.31 This result
is obtained from perturbation theory, where the scatter-
ing rate between two eigenstates is the product of three
contributions: the Boltzmann factor of the phonons n
evaluated at the energy gap between both states, the
exciton-phonon spectral density evaluated at the energy
gap, which is taken cubic for the glass environment, and
the overlap of the wave functions of the two states. We
refer to Ref. 31 for further details. In this model, it is
clear that the density of states at the band edge is very
important for the life time.

As was shown before, this density of states is very dif-
ferent in linear and 2D aggregates. As a result, the estab-
lished theory for linear aggregates in a glass must be used
with caution here. The Boltzmann factor is much larger
and more strongly peaked in the linear chain, leading to
larger scattering rates, and a smaller life time. Although
the spectral density typically increases with energy, this
is counteracted by the stronger exponential decay of the
Boltzmann factor. We also expect diﬀerent behavior of
the life time as a function of temperature, because the
argument used in Heijs et al. to arrive at the T 3.5 de-
pendence is valid only for kT > E2 − E1. We therefore
expect a diﬀerent behaviour of the temperature depen-
dence of the homogeneous line width, irrespective of the
details of the interaction with the phonons.

As the numerical calculations presented in Fig. 4 show,
the life time is up to more than an order of magnitude
larger in the brick layer system than in the linear aggre-
gate for the same system (delocalization) size. Life times
were computed for the same cubic spectral density in all
cases and, in contrast to the previous sections, for a near-
est neighbour coupling strength of J = −500cm−1, which
is a typical value for the aggregates considered. All long
range couplings were included as well. We note that the
population relaxation rate as a function of temperature
exhibits a power law dependence for linear aggregates,
while a kink is observed for a 2D lattice. The kink can
be understood as follows. In the argument leading to a
power law dependence of the scattering rates as a func-
tion of temperature, the summation over discrete states
is replaced by an integration.31 This replacement is valid
if the temperature is large compared to the energy gap
between the relevant exciton states, which are the lowest
two states in the band. For the 10x10 brick layer lattice
used in Fig. 4, the energy gap between these states is

found to be 71 cm−1, which corresponds to a temperature
of roughly 100 K. Therefore, the power law dependence,
which holds for high temperatures compared to the en-
ergy gap, breaks down and a kink is observed in the life
time. We also note that the temperature dependence of
the life time depends very strongly on A and s. As dis-
cussed in the appendix, there is almost no temperature
dependence for certain values, while for other values the
life time varies over orders of magnitude.

Note that, to make a direct comparison possible, these
calculations assume that the spectral density is the same
for linear and two-dimensional aggregates. We will argue
later, based on the analysis of the experimentally mea-
sured temperature dependence of the homogeneous line
width, that there is a linear component in the spectral
density for the two-dimensional aggregates. However, the
suppression of relaxation rates in the two-dimensional ag-
gregates based on the much smaller Boltzmann factor will
occur irrespective of the spectral density.

If, indeed, a linear spectral density is more appropriate
for two-dimensional aggregates, we can also obtain pop-
ulation relaxation rates for this case. The result is shown
in ﬁgure 5. Parameters were estimated based on the ex-
perimental data for a BIC aggregate, see section IV. For
this choice of the spectral density, the pure dephasing
can be characterized by a rate if the temperature is low
compared to the cut-oﬀ frequency of the bath.44 The life
time is also plotted in the ﬁgure. We observe that pure
dephasing dominates the homogeneous line width up to
a certain temperature, which depends on the system size
used in the simulations (i.e. the exciton localization size).
For higher temperatures, population relaxation becomes
more important. This ﬁnding can be used to determine
an upper limit for the delocalization size.

E. Dephasing in two-dimensional aggregates

Comparison with experiment shows that the predom-
inance of dephasing from population relaxation, which
is found for linear aggregates, does not explain experi-
ment for the thin ﬁlm. A perfectly linear relation be-
tween the homogeneous line width and the temperature
was measured.23 Although this ﬁnding could be explained
from population relaxation with a diﬀerent ω dependence
of the spectral density, this is not a plausible explanation
of the experimental ﬁndings. A sub-Ohmic power23, on
the order of ω0.5 in the spectral density would be needed.
There is no clear microscopic mechanism that would lead
to this behavior. Furthermore, it would be very surpris-
ing that the temperature dependence of the homogeneous
line width is exactly linear. Therefore, it is more logical
to assume that the mechanism leading to homogeneous
broadening is diﬀerent in linear and 2D aggregates.

The diﬀerent mechanism can be understood by the dif-
ference in population relaxation rates found in the previ-
ous section. In linear aggregates, the density of states at
the band edge is large, leading to strong scattering be-

7

tween exciton states and fast relaxation of the population
in the bright state. This population relaxation leads to
dephasing, which dominates the homogeneous line width.
In contrast, in two-dimensional aggregates, the density of
states at the band edge is orders of magnitude smaller.
Population relaxation, which depends strongly on the dif-
ference in energy between eigenstates, is suppressed for
the smooth spectral densities that we assume here. The
accompanying dephasing is therefore also much weaker
than in the case of linear aggregates. Therefore, pure de-
phasing becomes more important and can dominate the
homogeneous line width. This is the main ﬁnding of this
paper. This model predicts that the life time broaden-
ing is only a small part of the homogeneous line width.
This prediction could be tested experimentally by mea-
suring the life time of the bright state with pump-probe
spectroscopy.

We will now see how the dominance of pure dephasing
in two-dimensional aggregates leads to a linear scaling of
the homogeneous line width with temperature. We as-
sume that the spectral density is polynomial in frequency
up to a cut-oﬀ frequency ωC ,

J(ω) = CJ ωαfJ (ω/ωC),

(11)

where fJ (x) is a cut-oﬀ function. Common forms for this
function are an exponential, a Lorentzian or a Heaviside
step function. While this spectral density quite generally
describes the interaction with the bath, we assume here
that intramolecular vibrations do not play a role.

We are now in a position to analyse the pure dephasing
term g(t). In the fast modulation limit, which we assume
here because, as we will see, it leads to a linear relation
between the homogeneous line width and temperature,
one can replace the correlation function by a delta func-
tion, L(t) = Γpureδ(t). The pure dephasing contribution
to the spectrum is then given by a rate Γpure, because
g(t) = Γpuret. By comparing with Eq. 8 one ﬁnds that
the rate is related to the slope of the spectral density
at zero frequency,45,46 Γpure = limω→0 J(ω)/βω. There-
fore, there is no pure dephasing rate for a super-Ohmic
spectral density (α > 1). Note that this statement is
also valid outside the fast modulation limit, because the
linear term in the line shape function is also given by
the slope of the spectral density at zero frequency in the
more general case. There is still pure dephasing, but
g(t) has no linear term. For an Ohmic spectral density
(α = 1), which is the most commonly used form, be-
cause it corresponds to a linear density of states and a
frequency independent exciton phonon coupling, we see
that the pure dephasing rate is linearly proportional to
temperature.47 Thus, for an Ohmic spectral density in
the fast modulation limit, we expect a linear scaling of
the homogeneous line width with temperature. We note
that it would be desirable to measure the time scale of
the bath directly to strengthen this argument.

To close this section, we brieﬂy discuss Kubo stochas-
tic line shape theory,48 which is valid in the high tem-
perature limit, to estimate the temperature dependence

FIG. 5: Population life time (crosses) and pure dephasing life time (line) as a function of temperature for a linear spectral
density in a 2D aggregate. Parameters for the solid line, which shows the pure dephasing life time, have been extracted from
the BIC experiment (see Sec. IV for details), from which we can estimate the slope of the pure dephasing contribution as a
function of temperature, but not the delocalization size. For the calculation of the dephasing due to population relaxation,
which is plotted as crosses, the size is used as an input parameter. Calculations were performed for two diﬀerent sizes, and
the results are plotted with black crosses are for a delocalization size of Nk = 9 molecules (3x3 brick layer lattice), while blue
crosses are for Nk = 25 molecules (5x5 brick layer lattice).

of the pure dephasing in the slow dephasing limit. The
correlation function in this case is given by

ﬁnds σ2 = 2λ/β. The lineshape function for this model
is easily calculated to be

L(t) = σ2e−ωC t,

(12)

where the variance of the ﬂuctuations can be expressed
in terms of the reorganization energy λ and temperature
by calculating the correlation function from the Drude-
Lorentz spectral density J(ω) = 2λωCω/(ω2 + ω2

(13)

One sees that in the fast modulation limit g(t) =
2λt/βωC, in agreement with the pure dephasing rate in-
troduced earlier.
In the slow modulation limit, g(t) =

σ2t2/2, where σ is related to the inhomogeneity in the
energies of exciton states. The line shape in the fre-
quency domain is a Gaussian with standard deviation
proportional to σ. Because the variance σ2 is linearly
proportional to temperature, the line width scales as the
square root of temperature in this regime. Note that
this regime is less relevant for our discussion of the ho-
mogeneous line width, which is determined by fast ﬂuc-
tuations, while very slow ﬂuctuation contribute only to
the inhomogeneous line width. However, this analysis
shows that if the fast modulation limit is not strictly
applicable,49 deviations from linear scaling of the line
width with temperature are expected.

Before presenting a comparison to experiment, we
brieﬂy discuss the role of static disorder. As indicated
by Eq. 13, at low temperature, the line-shape and its T-
dependence will be dominated by inhomogeneous broad-
ening resulting from static disorder. In fact, a published
calculation [see Fig. 7 of Ref. 50] clearly shows the tran-
sition from inhomogeneous broadening to homogenous
broadening in the disordered chain system. Interestingly,
this transition corresponds to optimal diﬀusion along the
chain, suggestion optimization when dynamics and static
disorders balance. Another point is that the relative con-
tribution of pure dephasing decreases with the size of
localization, as shown in Fig. 5. It is known that the An-
derson localization size scales with the disorder and this
universal scaling depends critically on the dimensional-
ity. This scaling and its implication on diﬀusion were
reported in a recent study27 and will be further explored
in two-dimensional J-aggregates.51

IV. EXTRACTING PARAMETERS FROM

EXPERIMENT

By comparing the measured 2D spectra in ref. 23 with
our calculated spectra, we observe that a slip around 1.0
is the most plausible structure for these systems. A slip
around 0.5 and smaller is ruled out, because an extra in-
duced absoption peak appears below the bleaching and
stimulated emission peak, which is not observed in ex-
periment.

As explained in section III C, the estimate of the reso-
nant transfer interactions in two-dimensional aggregates
should be done with a diﬀerent formula than in linear
aggregates. To obtain an estimate of the coupling J, one
should divide the excitonic peak shift by a factor of 4.9.
This factor depends on s and A. By doing this, we ﬁnd
that the nearest neighbor coupling in the aggregate stud-
ied by Arias et al.
is around -75 meV for BIC (instead
of -153 meV based on a linear model) and -104 meV for
U3 (instead of -212 meV). In PTCDA aggregates con-
sidered by Mueller et al., the shift was found to be 400
cm-1. This would lead to an interaction of -82 cm−1.
This value corresponds to -10 meV, and is therefore sig-
niﬁcantly smaller than for the other two aggregates.

9

width is completely determined by pure dephasing, we
can extract system parameters from the experimental
data by following the discussion in the previous section.
The slope of the homogeneous line width versus temper-
ature, Γ = ST , is given by S = 2λkB/ωCNk, where Nk
is the localization size of the exciton. Thus, we ﬁnd that
2λ/ωC = 0.268Nk for BIC. To proceed further, it would
be desirable to measure ωC independently, for example
from the time dependent Stokes shift.

From this estimate, by assuming a value for Nk, we
can derive the parameters for the model by Heijs et al.,
and calculate the population relaxation times as shown
in ﬁgure 5. We used the same large value of ωC = 10J,
which means that we are consistently in the Markovian
regime. We conclude that in order to obtain a linear
relationship between homogeneous life time and temper-
ature up to 250 K, the exciton should be localized on a
segment smaller than 9 molecules (3x3). For larger tem-
peratures, deviations from linear behaviour are expected,
as can be seen in the ﬁgure. This is consistent with the
dynamic localization size estimated from experiments on
BIC and U3,23 and slightly smaller than values found for
PTCDA.24 Note that in our modiﬁed Redﬁeld approach
dynamic localization is not included by construction and
that we therefore regard Nk as a parameter in the calcu-
lations.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have used the standard Frenkel exci-
ton model to study the excitonic properties in brick layer
thin ﬁlm J-aggregates. We have introduced a novel the-
ory to explain the experimentally measured linear tem-
perature dependence of the pure dephasing rate.

We have found that the exciton couplings determined
from peak shifts in the linear spectrum depend strongly
on the geometry of the system. In particular, the cou-
plings in two-dimensional aggregates are a few times
smaller than estimates based on a linear aggregate model.
To explain the linear scaling of the homogeneous line
width with temperature, we propose pure dephasing as
the main homogeneous broadening mechanism. Because
the energy gaps between exciton states at the bottom of
the band are much larger in two-dimensional than in lin-
ear aggregates, population relaxation is surpressed. This
leads to a smaller contribution to the line width from
population relaxation in two-dimensional aggregates, as
well as to longer exciton life times. From the experi-
mental data, we can extract the product of the reorga-
nization energy and the typical bath time reorganization
time scale. Pump-probe experiments, which can measure
the lifetime of excited states, are suggested to conﬁrm
whether dephasing due to population relaxation is in-
deed less important than pure dephasing. It will also be
valuable to determine the time scale of the reorganization
of the phonon environment experimentally.

Under the assumption that the homogeneous line

A much simpler model could in principle explain the

exact linear temperature dependence. Stochastic line
shape theory for a single two-level system coupled to a
bath in the fast modulation limit predicts a Lorentzian
homogeneous line with a width ∆2τ , where ∆ is the stan-
dard deviation of the ﬂuctuations and τ their correlation
time. Because the variance of the ﬂuctuations depends
linearly on temperature this would explain the observed
temperature dependence irrespective of the form of the
spectral density.

A microscopic model that could make the exciton state
behave as an eﬀective two-level system is the presence of
correlated ﬂuctuations. If the site energy ﬂuctuations are
not independent, as in the model of Heijs et al., but corre-
lated over a distance comparable to the exciton localiza-
tion size, they will not lead to scattering between eigen-
states, and therefore no contribution to the line width
from scattering in the exciton band occurs. We believe
that the localization size is large enough to make the
model of correlated ﬂuctuations not plausible.

Our calculations are limited by the assumption in mod-
iﬁed Redﬁeld theory, where oﬀ-diagonal ﬂuctuations in
the exciton basis are treated perturbatively and therefore
dynamic localization is not included. They could be im-
proved by taking both the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal sys-
tem bath coupling terms into account non-perturbatively.
This could be achieved with the cumulant expansion
method,52,53 stochastic path integrals,54 or hierarchy of
equation of motion simulations.55 These methods can be
used to study the eﬀect of dynamic localization,56 but
are diﬃcult to apply given the large reorganization en-
ergy and low temperature compared to the excitonic cou-
pling in the system. They could also be used to calculate
the localization size, which is treated as a parameter in
our work. We remark that modiﬁed Redﬁeld theory be-
comes more accurate with an increase in the excitonic en-
ergy gap, which means that the theory is more accurate
for systems of modest localization size, as we consider
here. For some aggregates, intermolecular vibrations are
important,20,24 which could be considered in future work.
Experimental measurement of the Stokes shift may help
to improve our understanding of the role of vibrations.
Finally, it would be desirable to get a better estimate of
the resonant transfer interactions from quantum chem-
ical simulations and to include radiative decay to the
ground state in our calculations. On the experimental
side, collecting 2D spectra as a function of the waiting
time to elucidate energy transfer mechanisms57 would be
a possible future extension.

The results presented here contribute to the un-
derstanding of the photophysics of two-dimensional J-
aggregate thin ﬁlms.

Appendix: more geometries

In this appendix, we consider a wider range of geome-
tries than were presented in the main text, in particular,
a brick layer lattice with a larger aspect ratio A = 3.

In ﬁgure 6 we plot the resonant transfer interaction for
an aspect ratio of 3. Similar as in the case A = 2, we ﬁnd
that there is only a limited range of values of the slip s for
which interactions are negative in the horizontal as well
as the vertical direction. In ﬁgure 7 we plot the density
of states for A = 3. We observe a clear diﬀerence in the
density of states at the band edge between linear aggre-
gates and brick layer aggregates. We note that for a slip
of s = 0.5, the state with maximum oscillator strength is
blue shifted with respect to the monomer.

We calculated the life time of the bright state for a
6x6 brick layer lattice for diﬀerent values of A and s,
using the same procedure as outlined in the main text.
For A = 2, with s = 0.25 and s = 0.5, the temperature
dependence varies dramatically less than for the value
of s = 1.0 used in the main text (data not shown). In
particular, for s = 0.25 the lifetime is constant at the
very small value of 1.5 · 10−7 ps over the entire range of
temperatures considered (20 to 350 K). For s = 0.5, the
life time decreases from 8 · 10−4 ps at 20 K to 2 · 10−4 ps
at 350 K, still a much smaller variation than was observed
in Fig. 4 for s = 1.0. We attribute the diﬀerence to the
presence of states which are lower in energy than the
bright state. The system can relax to these states by
spontaneous emission of a phonon, which is independent
of temperature.

For A = 3 and s = 0.5, we also ﬁnd a constant lifetime
over the range of temperature from 20 K to 350 K. For
s = 1.0 and s = 1.5, we ﬁnd a very strong dependence
on temperature, as can be seen from the data plotted
in Fig. 8. We conclude that measuring the temperature
dependence of the life time of the bright state can be
used as a tool to probe the molecular arrangement in
brick layer aggregates.
