Abstract

We have investigated the dynamical properties of coherent phonons generated in antimony under

high density photo excitation. Precise measurements and extended analysis of coherent phonon os-

cillations provide new insights into the process of impulsive softening. In the process of recovering

from instantaneous softening, phonon frequency shows an unexpected temporal evolution involving

an abrupt change and a slight overshoot. Moreover, ﬂuence dependence of the initial phonon fre-

quency is strongly correlated with the phonon frequency shift of the high-pressure Raman spectra.

These results clearly prove that the structural changes (lattice contraction and expansion) induced

by laser excitation governs the softening mechanism of coherent phonons.

Photoexcitation of materials with intense femtosecond laser pulses has led to a unique

physical process in various materials on a femtosecond time scale. For example, phase

transition [1], laser ablation [2–4], laser melting [5, 6], and band-gap renormalization [7, 8]

have been intensively studied. Softening of coherent phonons under high density excitation

is one of the most important and promising phenomena to investigate. In addition to the

continuous eﬀorts to clarify the generation and detection mechanism of coherent phonons of

various materials [9–11], their softening mechanism under high density excitation has been

intensively focused. Early observations of the softening of coherent phonons in antimony

and tellurium have been reported, and the mechanisms have been deduced as ionic screening

by photoexcited carriers and purely electronic softening of the crystal lattice, respectively

[12, 13]. Hase et al. have proposed that the softening mechanism involves anharmonicity of

the lattice potential instead of electronic softening of the crystal lattice [14]. The eﬀect of

photoexcited electron-hole plasma on the phonon dispersion relation of bismuth has been

investigated using ﬁrst principles density-functional perturbation theory, and its inﬂuence

on phonon softening also has been discussed [15]. Recently, time-resolved X-ray diﬀraction

experiments have revealed the atomic motion of bismuth under phonon softening conditions

[16]. However, the existing experimental evidence is still insuﬃcient to arrive at a ﬁnal

conclusion on the phonon softening mechanism.

In this study, we explore the precise measurement of coherent phonon oscillations in

antimony under high density excitation and examine the details of time evolution of fre-

quency shifts. Time evolution exhibits an abrupt change and a slight overshoot, which are

hardly expected from a carrier-phonon interaction. Moreover, ﬂuence dependence of the

initial frequency is closely correlated with the high-pressure Raman experimental results.

The correlation is well explained by the theory based on the quantum motion of nuclei un-

der intense excitation of bonding electrons. These results clearly prove that the structural

changes induced by laser excitation govern the softening mechanism of coherent phonons.

The sample used in our experiment is a single crystal of antimony, with its surface perpen-

dicular to the trigonal axis. Our experiments are performed in a reﬂection-type pump-probe

system at room temperature. A commercial Ti:sapphire oscillator operating at repetition

rates of 80 MHz and pulse width of 100 fs is used as the excitation light source. The pump

and probe beams are orthogonally polarized to each other and they are coaxially arranged

using a polarization beam splitter. The beams are focused on the sample to a diameter of

2

about 3µm with a microscope objective lens having a focal length of 4.5 mm. A high density

excitation condition of maximum 20 mJ/cm2 is easily achieved in this conﬁguration. In one

series of measurements, the pump pulse width is controlled with a prism pair compensator

so that the amplitude of the coherent phonon is varied without changing the ﬂuence. The

signal is averaged by a rapid scan system with an optical shaker typically operating at 20

Hz.

Figure 1(a) shows the time-resolved reﬂectivity changes at diﬀerent pump power densities.

The period of phonon oscillation is prolonged and its decay time is shortened with ﬂuence.

Vertical lines are located at the peak positions of the coherent phonon signal for the lowest

ﬂuence, and the change in peak positions with the oscillation period is distinctly observed.

The corresponding Fourier transformed (FT) spectra are shown in Fig. 1(b). The peak

frequency of the A1g mode down-shifts and the spectrum shape is asymmetrically broadened

to the lower frequency side.

The eﬀect of anharmonicity of the lattice potential on softening of the A1g mode is

examined by controlling the phonon amplitude. The width of the pump pulse is adjusted

by a prism pair, while the width of the probe pulse is maintained at 100fs. As the pump

pulse width increases with the period of phonon oscillation, the amplitude of the coherent

phonon drastically decreases. Figure 2(a) shows the coherent phonon signal for three pump

pulse widths at a ﬂuence of 7.0 mJ/cm2. The pump pulse width is evaluated by the width

of the cross-correlation trace with probe-pulse and the time traces are labeled with these

values. The corresponding cross-correlation traces are displayed in the inset. The amplitude

of the phonon oscillation decreases by several times with the pump pulse width; however, the

temporal proﬁles show negligible change. Figure 2(b) shows the corresponding Fourier power

spectra obtained after removing the monotonic component. We also veriﬁed the dependence

on the pump pulse width at higher ﬂuences up to 17.3 mJ/cm2, which is immediately below

the damage threshold, and found that the temporal proﬁle shows no signiﬁcant change.

It is clearly shown that the softening of coherent phonons is mostly determined by the

accumulation of the pump pulse energy and not by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential.

To analyze the time-dependent frequency shift, we numerically ﬁt the data over a mono-

cycle of phonon oscillation with a function expressed as the sum of damping oscillation and

a single exponential decay, and determine the instantaneous frequency. The region of the

monocycle is selected approximately by the naked eye, and the frequency thus obtained is

insensitive to the detail of the selection.

Open squares shown in Fig. 3 indicate the ﬂuence dependence of initial frequency of

the coherent phonon obtained by monocycle ﬁtting. The frequency superlinearity decreases

with ﬂuence and shows saturation above 10 mJ/cm2. Excitation exceeding 20 mJ/cm2 leads

to optical damage of the sample. Filled circles in Fig. 3 indicate the ﬂuence dependence

of the height of the initial peak. The ﬁgure shows that the initial peak height increases

linearly with ﬂuence, which indicates that there is no signiﬁcant absorption saturation.

Therefore, the saturation of frequency shift originates from a purely internal mechanism.

Fourier power spectra at the corresponding ﬂuence is displayed in the inset of Fig. 3. The

spectrum shows a large frequency shift and broadening as the ﬂuence increases from 4.3

to 8.7 mJ/cm2. Compared with the spectrum at 8.7 mJ/cm2, the frequency shift of the

spectrum at 17.3 mJ/cm2 is saturated, although remarkable growth of the low frequency

component materializes.

Figure 4 shows time evolutions of the amplitude and frequency of the coherent A1g phonon

for two ﬂuences. Although the amplitude decreases almost exponentially with a decay

constant of 0.4 ps−1 at 0.2 mJ/cm2, it shows an accelerated decay for the ﬁrst 6 ps at

8.7 mJ/cm2, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The time dependence of frequency at 8.7 mJ/cm2

indicates an abrupt change and a slight overshoot of the phonon frequency around the

time delay of 2 ps in contrast to the ﬂat time evolution at 0.2 mJ/cm2, as shown in Fig

4(b). At higher ﬂuences, an abrupt change in frequency also appears around the time delay

of 2 ps and becomes more discontinuous. After these transient responses, the frequency

reaches a thermal equilibrium value of 4.50 THz, which lasts onward and the corresponding

temperature is very close to room temperature. These experimental results, the saturation

behavior of the softening and the unusual time evolution of phonon frequency, indicate that

the mechanism of the softening process involves structural change rather than carrier-phonon

interaction.

The change in the phonon frequency of the semi-metal that is initiated by the structural

change under a high-pressure condition was extensively studied by Raman scattering and

pump-probe experiments [17–19]. Figure 5 shows the comparison of the ﬂuence dependence

of the initial frequency of the coherent phonon with the uniaxial pressure dependence of the

static phonon frequency measured by Raman scattering [18]. Crosses in the ﬁgure indicate

the pressure dependence of the Raman peak frequency, and the pressure is indicated in

the upper horizontal axis. Vertical dashed lines located at the pressures of 7.2 and 9.0 GPa

correspond to the phase boundaries of Sb-I (hexagonal setting), Sb-IV, and Sb-II (host-guest

structure). Filled circles indicate the pump ﬂuence dependence of the phonon frequency, and

the ﬂuence is indicated in the lower horizontal axis. We set the conversion ratio of ﬂuence

to pressure as 0.9 GPa per 1.0 mJ/cm2 so that the two curves overlap. Surprisingly, not

only the decreases in super linearity at the Sb-I phase but also the saturation behavior at

phase IV show extremely good agreement with the ﬂuence dependence. This correspondence

between the transient frequency and static pressure shifts of the phonon frequency clearly

indicates that the optical high density excitation generates a compressed state whose pressure

is proportional to the ﬂuence. Since there is no absorption saturation, as shown in Fig. 3,

the disagreement of the frequency of the coherent phonon corresponding to the Sb-II phase

could be explained by the formation of a quasi-stable state instead of a host-guest structure.

In contrast to the generally accepted idea that high density excitation weakens the cova-

lent bond and the lattice undergoes the same expansion process as it undergoes when subject

to a heating condition, time-resolved electron diﬀraction measurements have revealed instan-

taneous contraction of the atomic distance in graphite [2, 20]. Theoretically, the contraction

in graphite [21] and the mechanism is now considered as the eﬃcient LA phonon emission

by the double resonant Raman process [22, 23]. A similar mechanism is also expected in

our case; the lattice contraction explains the good correspondence between the ﬂuence and

pressure dependences of the phonon frequency, as shown in Fig. 5.

From the result of the optically generated high-pressure state, the following considera-

tion is provided for the energy balance and the surface dynamics. The conventional material

parameters used below are taken from the literature [24]. The sheet energy density of the

strain is roughly expressed as u = p2d/2C33, where p is the pressure, d is the penetration

depth, and C33 is the elastic modulus along the c-axis. Here, we calculate the strain energy

density at the excitation density of 10 mJ/cm2. Using the pressure p of 9.0 GPa, the elastic

modulus C33 of 44.6 GPa, and the optical penetration depth of 13 nm, the resultant strain

energy density is 1.2 mJ/cm2. p is deduced from the frequency shift shown in Fig. 5; the

elastic modulus C33 is obtained from the ultrasonic measurement; and the optical penetra-

tion depth is deﬁned as the inverse of the absorption coeﬃcient (1/α) of the amorphous

ﬁlm of antimony at a wavelength of 790 nm. Since the photoabsorbed energy is determined

as 3.0 mJ/cm2 from the optical reﬂectivity of 70 %, it is concluded that a large amount

of the absorbed energy is converted into strain energy for the lattice, which is consistent

with the X-ray experimental result [25]. It is well known that a strain pulse with a picosec-

ond duration can be generated by irradiating a metal ﬁlm or a semiconductor with intense

femtosecond laser pulses and that it propagates into the sample [26–28]. Because our ex-

perimental conditions are very close to this situation, a strain pulse is also expected, and

the lattice contraction corresponds to the initial stage of the strain pulse. The spatial size

of the strain pulse estimated by the optical penetration depth d is 13 nm, and the acoustic

velocity v of antimony along the c-axis is about 2584 m/s. Therefore, the escape time of the

7

strain pulse from the optical penetration layer is calculated as 5.0 ps. The complete recovery

from phonon softening and the small temperature increase observed after 5 ps, as shown in

Fig. 4, are satisfactorily explained by the strain pulse, which carries away the structural

deformation and the associated energy from the surface. Further theoretical and experimen-

tal research is needed to clarify the dynamics of highly photoexcited solid surfaces. It is

strongly emphasized that the high-pressure Raman scattering experiment is very powerful

for understanding high density excitation phenomena.

In conclusion, we have investigated the impulsive softening process in antimony by using

a precise measurement system based on rapid scan and microscope optics. The detailed

analysis of the instantaneous frequency shift yields unexpected ﬁndings. The ﬂuence depen-

dence of the initial frequency is strongly correlated with the high-pressure Raman scattering

experiment and the time evolution of the phonon frequency shows an abrupt change and

overshoot. These results clearly indicate that the highly excited surface layer undergoes con-

traction and successive expansion processes that leads to ablation. Transient high pressure

associated with lattice contraction represents the extreme reduction in the phonon frequency

and the time evolution of the phonon frequency indicates the lattice deformation dynamics.

Simple estimation of the energy balance reveals that most of the photo-injected energy is

converted to lattice strain energy and the duration of the softening process is consistent with

the exit time of the strain pulse propagating deep into the sample.
