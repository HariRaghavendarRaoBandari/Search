Abstract

Consider the polynomial ring in any ﬁnite number of variables over the complex
numbers, endowed with the ℓ1-norm on the system of coeﬃcients. Its completion is
the Banach algebra of power series that converge absolutely on the closed polydisc.
Whereas the strong Hilbert Nullstellensatz does not hold for Banach algebras in
general, we show that it holds for ideals in the polynomial ring that are closed for
the indicated norm. Thus the corresponding statement holds at least partially for the
associated Banach algebra. We also describe the closure of an ideal in small cases.

Introduction

Background: Fix a natural number n and abbreviate C[X] := C[X1, . . . , Xn]. For any
ideal I ⊂ C[X] consider the zero set
(1.1)

Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz [11] asserts that for any ideal I we have I(V (I)) = Rad(I). The
special case with V (I) = ∅ is often called the weak Nullstellensatz and says that V (I) = ∅
if and only if I = (1). One strategy of proof, due to Rabinowitsch [16], is to deduce the
strong Nullstellensatz from the weak one using localization (see, e.g., Harris [10, Ch. 5]).
Both results are really properties of the ﬁnitely generated C-algebra A := C[X]/I.
Namely, the set V (I) is in natural bijection with the set of all C-algebra homomorphisms
A → C, and the weak Nullstellensatz says that V (I) = ∅ if and only if A = 0, while the
strong Nullstellensatz says that any element of A whose value at each point of V (I) is zero
is nilpotent.

Now let A be a commutative complex Banach algebra, and let M(A) denote the set
of all continuous C-algebra homomorphisms A → C. A basic result (Naimark [15, §9.4,
§11.1]) states that there is a natural bijection from M(A) to the set of all maximal ideals of
A deﬁned by ϕ 7→ Ker(ϕ); in particular, all maximal ideals of A are closed. From this one
deduces the weak Nullstellensatz for commutative Banach algebras, namely that M(A) = ∅
if and only if A = 0.

The analogue of the strong Nullstellensatz would be the statement that any element
of A, whose value at each point of M(A) is zero, is nilpotent. This, however, is false in
general. But the usual counterexamples are based on deliberately devious constructions
(e.g. [17]) and do not arise naturally in algebraic geometry. One may therefore reasonably
ask whether a version of the strong Nullstellensatz still holds for the commutative Banach
algebras that one usually encounters. This article provides a partial answer to this question.

Note that literature on Banach algebras often leaves out the adjective ‘weak’ when
referring to the weak Nullstellensatz. Usually the goal is either to give an elementary proof
of the weak Nullstellensatz in a special situation, such as in von Renteln [19], Mortini-
von Renteln [14], Bridges-Mines-Richman-Schuster [3], Mortini-Rupp [13], or to prove an
analogue of the weak Nullstellensatz dealing only with an open part of the spectrum, as in
Gelca [7], [8], or in connection with the corona problem as in Carleson [4], Krantz-Li [12],
and many others. Namely, via the weak Nullstellensatz the corona statement is equivalent

2

to saying that a certain open subset of the spectrum of a Banach algebra is dense, and so
possesses no corona.

Results of this article: We consider C[X] as a normed C-algebra by setting

(1.4)

The reason for this choice is the following universal property:

(cid:13)(cid:13)Pk akX k(cid:13)(cid:13) := Pk |ak| ∈ R>0.

Proposition 1.5

(a) For any normed C-algebra (A,k k) and any elements aj ∈ A sat-
isfying kajk 6 1, there exists a unique C-algebra homomorphism ϕ : C[X] → A such
that ϕ(Xj) = aj for all 1 6 j 6 n and kϕ(f )k 6 kfk for all f ∈ C[X].

(b) The norm (1.4) is the only norm on C[X] which has the universal property (a) and

satisﬁes kXjk = 1 for all 1 6 j 6 n.

Proof. Combine the universal property of polynomial rings with the deﬁning properties
of norms on algebras.
(cid:3)

Let B := {z ∈ C : |z| 6 1} denote the closed unit disc and ∂B = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1}
its boundary, the unit circle. The completion of C[X] with respect to the chosen norm is
the algebra of power series that converge absolutely on the closed polydisc Bn. In fact, this
completion is a Banach algebra with spectrum naturally homeomorphic to Bn. In order
to stay closer to algebraic geometry we will, however, continue working with the normed
algebra C[X].

(1.6)

For any ideal I ⊂ C[X] consider the restricted zero set

M(I) := (cid:8)z ∈ Bn (cid:12)(cid:12) ∀f ∈ I : f (z) = 0(cid:9) = V (I) ∩ Bn.

As usual, we denote the closure of I by I, which is again an ideal (Naimark [15, §8.1]).
Since the evaluation map C[X] → C at any point of Bn is continuous with respect to the
norm k k, we have M(I) = M(I). The ﬁrst main result of this article is the following
analogue of the strong Nullstellensatz:

Theorem 1.7 For any ideal I ⊂ C[X] we have I(M(I)) = Rad(I).

This result can be interpreted as giving some information about the closure I, but not
all. It leads to the question whether one can describe I precisely in a purely algebraic
manner. To this we give the following partial answers. For any point z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ Cn
consider the maximal ideal mz := (X1 − z1, . . . , Xn − zn) of C[X].
Theorem 1.8 For any z ∈ Cn and any mz-primary ideal I ⊂ C[X] we have

I = (cid:26) I + (Xj − zj)16j6n, |zj|=1

(1)

if z ∈ Bn,
if z 6∈ Bn.

3

We can interpret this result heuristically as saying that only points z ∈ Bn contribute
to the spectrum of (C[X],k k) and that within this spectrum, inﬁnitesimal deformations in
the direction Xj are possible to arbitrarily high degree if zj ∈ B◦, but not at all if zj ∈ ∂B.
The last statement is geometrically plausible in so far as any algebraic deformation of
zj ∈ ∂B would have tangent space C and would thus include an inﬁnitesimal deformation
in the direction out of B, which should be impeded.

We also analyze the situation in dimension 2, the most interesting case being:

Theorem 1.9 Consider any irreducible polynomial f ∈ C[X1, X2] such that M((f )) is
inﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2. Then for any k > 1 we have

(f k) = (f ).

The heuristic explanation for this result is the same as above. We also have a complete
answer in dimension 6 2 or in the case of ﬁnite support. Note that Theorem 1.8 yields an
explicit description of mr

z for all z ∈ Bn and r > 1.

Theorem 1.10 Consider any ideal I ⊂ C[X]. If M(I) is ﬁnite or n 6 2, then

I = \z∈Bn\r>1(cid:0)I + mr
z(cid:1).

I am sorely tempted to conjecture that Theorem 1.10 is true without any condition on
I or n. However, at present I cannot exclude the possibility that the ambient dimension n
has some inﬂuence. For example consider the polynomial

f := 1 + w · (X1 + X2 + X3 + X1X2 + X1X3 + X2X3) + X1X2X3 ∈ C[X1, X2, X3]

for a real number 0 < w < 1. Its associated M((f )) is contained in (∂B)3 and Zariski dense
in the hypersurface V (f ). Therefore (f ) = (f ). With the methods used to prove Theorem
1.9, I can show that f 2 ∈ (f k) for all k > 2, but not the remaining step f ∈ (f 2).

Methods: The proof of Theorem 1.7 is contained in Sections 2 and 3. Consider a
system of generators (f1, . . . , fm) of I and a polynomial g ∈ I(M(I)). We ﬁrst use the
 Lojasiewicz inequality (see Bierstone-Milman [2, Thm. 6.4]) to write some power of g as a
linear combination gN = Pm
j=1 gjfj with functions gj ∈ C M (Bn) for suﬃciently large M.
Then we improve this representation successively by explicitly solving the ¯∂-equation as
in Krantz-Li [12, §2]. Hidden behind this is really the Koszul complex (compare Costea-
Sawyer-Wick [5]). This construction ends with another such linear combination, where the
gj are in addition holomorphic on (B◦)n. If now M > n
2 , those functions are represented by
power series which converge absolutely on Bn. Approximating these by polynomials ﬁnally
shows that gN ∈ I.
ﬁnite support part of Theorem 1.10, using relatively direct calculations.

In Section 4 we deal with the case of ﬁnite support and prove Theorem 1.8 and the

4

In Sections 5 and 6 we analyze plane curves in some detail and prove Theorem 1.9 as
part of Theorem 6.12. The key point here is Proposition 6.11, establishing something like
an approximate identity for the ideal (f ) (compare Mortini-von Renteln [14, page 223]).

Section 7 establishes the case n = 2 of Theorem 1.10 by combining the same kind of

arguments as before with a certain amount of commutative algebra.

We end this article with some examples in Section 8.

2 Preliminaries from analysis

Consider integers m, n > 0. According to one convention, a C-valued function on a closed
subset X ⊂ Rn lies in C m(X) if and only if it is the restriction of a C m-function on an
open neighborhood of X. We use a diﬀerent convention, following Bell [1, page 3].
Consider an open convex subset U ⊂ Rn. We will say that a function U → C lies
in C m(U) if and only if it is continuous and its restriction lies in C m(U) and all partial
derivatives of order 6 m thereof are continuous and extend to continuous functions on U .
A fundamental fact from real analysis states that a function on U lies in C m(U) if and
only if it and all its partial derivatives of order 6 m exist and are continuous. A slight
adaptation of the proof of this fact and the Taylor approximation yields:

Proposition 2.1 Consider any function v ∈ C m(U) and any point x ∈ U . Then for all
y ∈ U tending to x we have

v(y) = Xν=(ν1,...,νn)

ν1!· · · νn! ·(cid:16) ∂ν1

∂xν1

1 · · ·

∂νn
∂xνn
n

f(cid:17)(x) · (y − x)ν + o(cid:0)|y − x|m(cid:1),

where the sum extends over all ν1, . . . , νn > 0 with ν1 + . . . + νn 6 m.

From this we can directly deduce:

Proposition 2.2 For any function v ∈ C m(U ) and any C m-submanifold X ⊂ U , the
restriction v|X is a C m-function in the sense of manifolds.

Now let B denote the closed unit disc in C, as before. For any function v ∈ C(B × U )

and any point (z, x) ∈ B × U we set

(2.3)

K(v)(z, x) :=

1

2πiZB

v(ζ, x)
ζ − z

dζ ∧ dζ.

This integral converges, because v is continuous and ζ 7→ 1
ζ−z is locally L1 for the measure
dζ ∧ dζ. Thus K is a linear operator sending continuous functions on B × U to functions
on B × U. Abbreviate ¯∂ := ∂

∂ ¯z , and let ∇ denote the total derivative with respect to x.

5

Theorem 2.4 For any integer m > 1 and any function v ∈ C 2m+1(B × U ) we have
K(v) ∈ C m(B × U ) and ¯∂K(v) = v and ∇K(v) = K(∇v).
Proof. The analogous statement with m = ∞ and without the additional factor U
is that of Bell [1, Thm. 2.2]. The proof given there also works with only ﬁnitely often
diﬀerentiable functions and with parameters and yields the stated (perhaps suboptimal)
result. Speciﬁcally set ρ(z, x) := |z| − 1. Keeping track of the order of diﬀerentiability, the
same construction as in the proof of [1, Lem. 2.3] shows that for any integers ℓ > m + 1 > 0
and any function v ∈ C ℓ(B × U) there exist functions Φm, Ψm ∈ C ℓ−m−1(B × U) such that
Φm|(∂B × U ) = 0 and v = ¯∂Φm + Ψmρm+1. Applying this with ℓ = 2m + 1, the rest of the
proof goes through likewise.

(cid:3)

3 Proof of the strong Nullstellensatz

In this section we ﬁx an ideal I ⊂ C[X] and choose a system of generators (f1, . . . , fm).
Consider the real analytic function

F : Cn → R>0, z 7→Pm

j=1 |fj(z)|2.

Its zero locus on Bn is precisely the subset M(I) from (1.6). Fix a polynomial g ∈ I(M(I)).
Then by construction, the zero locus of F on Bn is contained in the zero locus of g. By
the  Lojasiewicz inequality (see Bierstone-Milman [2, Thm. 6.4]) we can therefore choose
an integer r > 0 and a real number c > 0 such that

(3.2)

∀z ∈ Bn :

|g(z)|r 6 c · F (z).

In the rest of this section we identify polynomials in C[X] with the functions Bn → C that
they represent. For any integers s, t > 0 consider the function

(3.1)

(3.3)

(3.5)

ϕs,t : Bn → C, z 7→


g(z)t
F (z)s

0

if z 6∈ M(I),
if z ∈ M(I).

Lemma 3.4 For any integers ℓ > 0 and s > 0 and t > r(s + ℓ) we have ϕs,t ∈ C ℓ(Bn).
Proof. By construction ϕs,t is C ∞ outside M(I). If t > rs, then on B r M(I) we have

F (cid:19)s
F s = (cid:18)|g|r

(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕs,t(cid:12)(cid:12) = |g|t

· |g|t−rs

(3.2)
6 cs · |g|t−rs.

Here |g|t−rs is continuous and vanishes on M(I), hence the same holds for ϕs,t. This proves
the lemma in the case ℓ = 0.

6

Next assume that t > r(s + 1). Then t − rs > 2, and so (3.5) implies that ϕs,t is real
diﬀerentiable everywhere and its total derivative ∇ϕs,t vanishes along M(I). On Bn rM(I)
we have

∇ϕs,t = t ·

gt−1
F s · ∇g − s ·

gt
F s+1 · ∇F

and hence

(3.6)

∇ϕs,t = t · ϕs,t−1 · ∇g − s · ϕs+1,t · ∇F.

Applying (3.5) to (s, t − 1) and (s + 1, t) in place of (s, t) shows that ϕs,t−1 and ϕs+1,t are
continuous and vanish on M(I). Thus the equation (3.6) holds on all of Bn, and ϕs,t is C 1.
This proves the lemma in the case ℓ = 1.

Equation (3.6) now also implies the general case ℓ > 1 by induction on ℓ.

(cid:3)

The next lemma and its proof are adapted from Krantz-Li [12, §2]. For all 1 6 i 6 n

we abbreviate ¯∂i := ∂
∂ ¯zi

Lemma 3.7 Consider any integers ℓ > 3 and t > r(2nℓ − 1). Then for every integer
0 6 k 6 n there exist functions gj,k ∈ C 2n−kℓ−2(Bn) for all 1 6 j 6 m satisfying ¯∂igj,k = 0
for all 1 6 i 6 k, such that

g2kt =

gj,kfj.

mXj=1

Proof. We prove this by induction on k, beginning with k = 0. By the construction (3.3)
with s = 1 and by (3.1) we have

gt = ϕ1,tF = ϕ1,t

mXj=1

fjfj =

mXj=1

ϕ1,tfj · fj

on Bn. Here ϕ1,t ∈ C 2nℓ−2(Bn) by Lemma 3.4, and fj is already C ∞ everywhere. Thus the
functions gj,0 := ϕ1,tfj possess the desired properties for k = 0.
Now assume that the desired functions gj,k are already given for some ﬁxed 0 6 k < n.
We must construct the next batch of functions gj,k+1. For any function h ∈ C(Bn) we set

Kk+1(h)(z1, . . . , zn) :=

1

2πiZB

f (z1, . . . , zk, ζ, zk+2, . . . , zn)

ζ − zk+1

dζ ∧ dζ.

Up to reordering the variables the operator Kk+1 is just the operator K from (2.3). For
any indices 1 6 j, j′ 6 m we have gj ′,k, gj,k ∈ C 2n−kℓ−2(Bn) by the induction hypothesis,
and hence gj ′,k

¯∂k+1gj,k ∈ C 2n−kℓ−3(Bn). By Theorem 2.4 we therefore have

uj,j ′

:= Kk+1(cid:0)gj ′,k

¯∂k+1gj,k(cid:1) ∈ C 2n−k−1ℓ−2(Bn)

7

and hence

gj,k+1 := g2ktgj,k −
The deﬁnition of gj,k+1 implies that

mXj ′=1
(uj,j ′ − uj ′,j) fj ′ ∈ C 2n−k−1ℓ−2(Bn).

uj ′,jfj ′fj

= g2kt g2kt = g2k+1t,

using the induction hypothesis and the symmetry between the last two sums.

Next, for all 1 6 i 6 k we have ¯∂igj ′,k = ¯∂igj,k = 0 by the induction hypothesis, and
since gj,k ∈ C 2, therefore also ¯∂i( ¯∂k+1gj,k) = ¯∂k+1( ¯∂igj,k) = 0. With the last equation in
Theorem 2.4 we deduce that

¯∂iuj,j ′ = ¯∂iKk+1(cid:0)gj ′,k ¯∂k+1gj,k(cid:1) = Kk+1(cid:0) ¯∂i(cid:0)gj ′,k ¯∂k+1gj,k(cid:1)(cid:1) = Kk+1(0) = 0.

Since fj ′ and g are holomorphic, plugging this into the formula deﬁning gj,k+1 and using
the induction hypothesis shows that

¯∂igj,k+1 = g2kt ¯∂igj,k = 0.

Moreover, by the deﬁnition of uj,j ′ and Theorem 2.4 we have

¯∂k+1uj,j ′ = ¯∂k+1Kk+1(cid:0)gj ′,k ¯∂k+1gj,k(cid:1) = gj ′,k ¯∂k+1gj,k.

Using this and the holomorphy of fj ′ and g we calculate

¯∂k+1gj,k+1 = g2kt ¯∂k+1gj,k −

mXj ′=1(cid:0) ¯∂k+1uj,j ′ − ¯∂k+1uj ′,j(cid:1) fj ′

mXj ′=1

With the induction hypothesis and the holomorphy of g we conclude that
¯∂k+1gj,k+1 = (g2kt − g2kt) ¯∂k+1gj,k + gj,k ¯∂k+1(g2kt) = 0.
Thus the functions gj,k+1 satisfy all requirements, and the lemma is proved.

(cid:3)

The case k = n of Lemma 3.7 directly yields:

Theorem 3.8 For any ideal I = (f1, . . . , fm) ⊂ C[X], any polynomial g ∈ I(M(I)), and
any integer ℓ > 3 there exist an integer N > 1 and functions gj ∈ C ℓ−2(Bn) which are
holomorphic on (B◦)n, such that

gN =

Now let A denote the ring of all power series in C[[X]] satisfying

(3.9)

(cid:13)(cid:13)Pk akX k(cid:13)(cid:13) := Pk |ak| < ∞

Equivalently this is the ring of all power series that converge absolutely on Bn, or again
the Banach algebra completion of C[X] with respect to k k.
Lemma 3.10 For any integer k > n
(B◦)n is represented by a power series in A.

As h|(B◦)n is holomorphic, by the Cauchy integral formula ak(r) is zero unless k ∈ (Z>0)n,
in which case it is the coeﬃcient of X k in the power series representing h|(B◦)n. In particular
ak(r) is independent of r and hence equal to ak. Thus Pk akX k is really the power series
representing h|(B◦)n.
On the other hand the restriction h|(∂B)n is C k by the assumption and Proposition
2.2. Since k > n
2 , its Fourier series is therefore absolutely convergent (see Grafakos [9,
Thm. 3.3.16]). Thus the power series Pk akX k is absolutely convergent on Bn. Finally,
Theorem 3.11 For any ideal I = (f1, . . . , fm) ⊂ C[X] and any polynomial g ∈ I(M(I)),
there exist an integer N > 1 and power series gj ∈ A such that

Proof. Use Theorem 3.8 with any ℓ > n

2 + 3 and apply Lemma 3.10.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.12 (= 1.7) For any ideal I ⊂ C[X] we have I(M(I)) = Rad(I).

9

Proof. As before write I = (f1, . . . , fm). For any g ∈ I(M(I)) choose N and gj as in
Theorem 3.11. Write each gj as the limit in A of a sequence of polynomials gj,k ∈ C[X] for
j=1 gjfj is the limit in A of the sequence of polynomialsPm
k → ∞. Then gN =Pm
j=1 gj,kfj ∈
I for k → ∞. Since gN is already a polynomial, this limit process already takes place in
the normed algebra C[X]; hence gN ∈ I. This proves that I(M(I)) ⊂ Rad(I).
Conversely consider any point z ∈ M(I). Then by (1.6) we have f (z) = 0 for all f ∈ I.
Since evaluation at z deﬁnes a continuous map C[X] → C for the norm k k, it follows that
f (z) = 0 for all f ∈ I as well. By the deﬁnition of the radical the same then also follows for
all f ∈ Rad(I). Varying z ∈ M(I) and using (1.2) thus shows that Rad(I) ⊂ I(M(I)). (cid:3)

Ideals with ﬁnite support

We begin with the case of one variable X.

Lemma 4.1 For any z ∈ C with |z| > 1 we have 1 ∈ (X − z).
z(cid:1)m
Proof. For all m > 1 we have 1 −(cid:0) X
zm → 0 for m → ∞. In the limit we deduce that 1 ∈ (X − z).

z(cid:1)m(cid:13)(cid:13) =

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2 For any z ∈ C with |z| = 1 and any k > 1 we have (X − z) ∈ ((X − z)k).
Proof. For all m > 1 the binomial theorem shows that

X m = (z + (X − z))m ≡ zm + mzm−1(X − z) modulo ((X − z)2).

Equivalently

(X − z) ≡

mzm−1 (X m − zm) modulo ((X − z)2).

1

Since |z| = 1, we have (cid:13)(cid:13) 1

mzm−1 (X m − zm)(cid:13)(cid:13) = 1

deduce that (X − z) ≡ 0 modulo ((X − z)2). This shows the case k = 2 of the lemma.
The general case follows by induction on k, the case k = 1 being trivial. If k > 2, the
induction hypothesis implies that (X − z)2 ∈ (X − z) · ((X − z)k−1) ⊂ ((X − z)k). Using
the case k = 2 it follows that (X − z) ∈ ((X − z)2) ⊂ ((X − z)k), as desired.

(cid:3)

m(1 + 1) → 0 for m → ∞. In the limit we

Lemma 4.3 For any z ∈ C with |z| = 1 the ideal (X − z) is closed.
Proof. Since |z| = 1, the evaluation map ℓ : C[X] → C, f 7→ f (z) satisﬁes |ℓ(f )| 6 kfk. It
is therefore continuous with respect to the metric induced by k k, and so its kernel (X − z)
is closed.

Lemma 4.4 For any z ∈ C with |z| < 1 and any k > 1 the ideal ((X − z)k) is closed.

10

Proof. For any ﬁxed ν > 0 consider the linear map ℓν : C[X] → C, f 7→ f (ν)(z). For each
j > 0 we have ℓν(X j) = j(j − 1) · · · (j − ν + 1)zj−ν. Since |z| < 1, this value tends to 0
for j → ∞. Thus there exists a real number cν > 0 such that |ℓν(X j)| 6 c for all j > 0. It
then follows that |ℓν(f )| 6 cνkfk for all f ∈ C[X]. Therefore ℓν is continuous with respect
to k k, and so its kernel is a closed subspace.
Varying ν it now follows that ((X − z)k) =Tk−1

ν=0 Ker(ℓν) is closed.

(cid:3)

Now we return to an arbitrary number of variables.

Lemma 4.5 For any ideals J ⊂ I ⊂ C[X] with dimC(I/J) < ∞, if J is closed, so is I.
Proof. Consider the seminorm induced by k k on the factor space C[X]/J. Since J is
closed, this seminorm is a norm. As any ﬁnite dimensional subspace of a normed C-vector
space is closed, it follows that I/J ⊂ C[X]/J is closed for the induced norm. Its inverse
image I ⊂ C[X] under the projection map is therefore closed for the norm k k.

For any point z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ Cn consider the maximal ideal
:= (X1 − z1, . . . , Xn − zn) ⊂ C[X].

mz

Theorem 4.6 (= 1.8) For any point z ∈ Cn and any mz-primary ideal I ⊂ C[X] we have

I = (cid:26) I + (Xj − zj)16j6n, |zj|=1

(1)

if z ∈ Bn,
if z 6∈ Bn.

Proof. We deduce this from the one variable case using the isometric embeddings C[Xj] ֒→
C[X] for all 1 6 j 6 n. By assumption we have mr
If |zj| > 1 for some j, we have 1 ∈ (Xj − zj) by Lemma 4.1, and hence 1 ∈(cid:0) (Xj − zj)(cid:1)r
⊂ ((Xj − zj)r) ⊂ I. Thus I = (1), as desired.
So suppose that |zj| 6 1 for all 1 6 j 6 n. By symmetry we can assume that |zj| < 1
if j 6 m, and |zj| = 1 if j > m. Since (Xj − zj)r ∈ mr
z ⊂ I, for each m < j 6 n we have
(Xj − zj) ∈ ((Xj − zj)r) ⊂ I by Lemma 4.2. Replacing I by I + (Xj − zj)m<j6n therefore
does not change I. Then we have J ⊂ I ⊂ C[X] with the ideal

z ⊂ I for some r > 1.

J := (cid:0)(X1 − z1)r, . . . , (Xm − zm)r, (Xm+1 − zm+1), . . . , (Xn − zn)(cid:1).

It remains to show that any ideal I with this property is closed. For this observe that for
any indices ν1, . . . , νm > 0, the linear map

C[X] → C, f 7→(cid:0) ∂ν1

∂X

ν1

· · · ∂νm

∂X νm

f(cid:1)(z)

is continuous with respect to k k by the same arguments as in the proofs of Lemmas 4.3
and 4.4. Thus its kernel is closed. Since J is the intersection of these kernels for all possible
indices ν1, . . . , νm ∈ {0, . . . , r − 1}, it follows that J is closed. With Lemma 4.5 we deduce
that I is closed, as desired.

(cid:3)

Note that Theorem 1.8 yields an explicit description of mr

z for all z ∈ Bn and r > 1.

11

Proof. The ideals I + mr

(b). Assertion (d) is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition.

z are all closed by Lemma 4.5. Thus their intersection is closed,

(b) I ⊂ eI ⊂ I(M(I)).
(c) I ⊂ eI =eI =eeI.
(d) For any ideals I ⊂ J we have eI ⊂ eJ.
(e) For any ideals I, J we have eI · eJ ⊂ g(IJ).
proving (a). Next, the inclusion I ⊂ eI is obvious. Also, for all z ∈ M(I) we have I ⊂ mz
and mz = mz and hence eI ⊂ I + mz = mz. Therefore eI ⊂Tz∈M (I)
Returning to (c), for all z ∈ Bn and r > 1 the deﬁnition implies that eI + mr
z ⊂
z(cid:1) + mr
(cid:0)I + mr
z. Varying z and r it follows that eeI ⊂ eI. On the other hand, by
(a) we have I ⊂ I ⊂ eI, which by (d) implies that eI ⊂ eI ⊂ eeI. Together this implies the
z(cid:1) ⊂(cid:0)IJ + mr
z(cid:1).
Finally in (e), for all z ∈ Bn and r > 1 we have eI ·eJ ⊂(cid:0)I + mr
By varying z and r this implies that eI · eJ ⊂ g(IJ), as desired.
Theorem 4.9 For any ideal I ⊂ C[X] with M(I) ﬁnite we have I = eI.
Proof. By Proposition 4.8 (c) we already have I ⊂ eI. Conversely, by the ﬁniteness of
M(I) and Theorem 1.7 we have Rad(I) = Qz∈M (I)
mz. Thus there exists r > 1 with
Qz∈M (I)
mr
z ⊂ I. By continuity of addition and multiplication in C[X] this implies that
Qz∈M (I)
z ⊂ I. As the ideals I + mr
z are primary to mutually distinct maximal ideals, it

z(cid:1)·(cid:0)J + mr

mr
follows that

z = I + mr

equalities in (d).

mz = I(M(I)), proving

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.7 To any ideal I ⊂ C[X] we associate the ideal

eI := \z∈Bn\r>1(cid:0)I + mr
z(cid:1).

Proposition 4.8

(a) eI is closed.

eI ⊂ \z∈M (I)(cid:0)I + mr

z(cid:1) != Yz∈M (I)(cid:0)I + mr

z(cid:1) ⊂ I.

Together this implies that I = eI.

5 Plane curves

In the rest of this article we study the case n = 2.

Proposition 5.1 For any irreducible polynomial f ∈ C[X1, X2] we have precisely one of
the following cases:
(a) M((f )) ∩ (B◦)2 6= ∅.
(b) M((f )) = {z1} × B and f = u(X1 − z1) for some z1 ∈ ∂B and u ∈ C×.
(c) M((f )) = B × {z2} and f = u(X2 − z2) for some z2 ∈ ∂B and u ∈ C×.
(d) M((f )) is inﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2.

(e) M((f )) is ﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2, possibly empty.

Moreover, in the cases (a) through (d) we have I(M((f ))) = (f ).

Proof. If M((f )) contains a point z ∈ (B◦)2, it contains a whole neighborhood of z in the
irreducible curve V ((f )). Then M((f )) is Zariski dense in V ((f )); hence I(M((f ))) = (f ),
and we have the case (a).

1, z′

2) with z′

Next suppose that M((f )) contains a point z = (z1, z2) ∈ ∂B × B◦. If the projection to
the ﬁrst coordinate V ((f )) → C is not constant, it is an open map, and so any neighborhood
of z contains a point (z′
1 ∈ B◦. Choosing the neighborhood small enough
guarantees that z′
2 ∈ B◦ as well, and we are back in the case (a). Otherwise the projection
map is constant and the curve must be given by the equation X1 = z1. Then M((f )) =
{z1} × B and of course I(M((f ))) = (f ), and we have the case (b).

By symmetry, if M((f )) contains a point from B◦ × ∂B, we have the case (a) or (c).
If none of these cases applies, we must have M((f )) ⊂ (∂B)2. If M((f )) is then inﬁnite,
it is again Zariski dense in the irreducible curve V ((f )); hence I(M((f ))) = (f ), and we
have the case (d). Otherwise we are left with the case (e).
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.2 In the case (a) of Proposition 5.1, for all k > 1 we have

(f k) = g(f k) = (f k).

Proof. Pick any point z ∈ M((f )) ∩ (B◦)2. Then for each r > 1 we have mr
r
z = m
z by
Theorem 1.8. As the completion of C[X] for the mz-adic topology is the power series ring
C[[X − z]] := C[[X1 − z1, X2 − z2]], we deduce that

g(f k) ⊂ I := \r>1(cid:0)(f k) + m

r

z(cid:1) = C[X] ∩ f k · C[[X − z]].

We claim that I = (f k). This, together with the inclusions (f k) ⊂ (f k) ⊂ g(f k) from

Proposition 4.8 yields the desired equalities.

13

To prove the claim observe ﬁrst that, since f lies in mz, it is not a unit in C[[X−z]]. Thus
f·C[[X−z]] is an ideal of height 1 of C[[X−z]], and so dimC(cid:0)C[[X−z]]/f·C[[X−z]](cid:1) = ∞.
As the image of C[X] in C[[X − z]]/f · C[[X − z]] is dense for the (X1 − z1, X2 − z2)-adic
topology, it, too, is inﬁnite dimensional. Thus C[X] ∩ f · C[[X − z]] is an ideal of inﬁnite
codimension of C[X] containing the irreducible polynomial f . This ideal is therefore equal
to (f ). By induction on k it follows that C[X] ∩ f k · C[[X − z]] = (f k) for all k > 1, as
claimed.

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.3 In the cases (b) and (c) of Proposition 5.1, for all k > 1 we have

(f k) = g(f k) = (f ).

Proof. By symmetry it suﬃces to consider the case 5.1 (b). Without loss of generality we
then have f = (X1 − z1) for some z1 ∈ ∂B. By Lemma 4.2 and the isometric embedding
C[X1] ֒→ C[X] we already know that (f ) ⊂ (f k). On the other hand Proposition 4.8 (c)
and (b) implies that (f k) ⊂ g(f k) ⊂ (f ). Together this yields the desired equalities.

In the case (e) of Proposition 5.1 the ideal (f k) is described by Theorem 4.9 for all
k > 1. The most interesting and diﬃcult case (d) of Proposition 5.1 is treated in the
following section.

(cid:3)

6 Plane curves touching the bidisc

This section is devoted to the case (d) of Proposition 5.1. First we give an explicit descrip-
tion of the curves with this property.

Consider an irreducible polynomial f ∈ C[X1, X2] for which M((f )) is inﬁnite and
contained in (∂B)2. We view C as a subset of the Riemann sphere ˆC := C ∪ {∞} ∼=
P1(C), and let C ⊂ ˆC2 denote the closure of the curve V (f ). Let π : ˜C → C denote the
normalization of C, so that ˜C is an irreducible smooth projective algebraic curve over C.
Let πj : ˜C → ˆC denote the composite of π with the projection to the j-th factor. Recall
that the M¨obius transformation µ(z) := i 1−z

1+z is an automorphism of ˆC with

µ(∂B) = ˆR := R ∪ {∞} ∼= P1(R) and
µ(B◦) = H := {z ∈ C | Im(z) > 0}.

(a) The curve (µ × µ)(C) ⊂ ˆC2 is deﬁned over R.

Proposition 6.1
(b) We have C ∩ (∂B × ˆC) = C ∩ ( ˆC × ∂B) = C ∩ (∂B)2.
(c) The bidegree (d1, d2) of C ⊂ ˆC2 satisﬁes d1, d2 > 1.
(d) For each j the map πj : ˜C → ˆC is unramiﬁed over ∂B.
(e) For each z ∈ ∂B we have |π−1

1 (z)| = d2 and |π−1

2 (z)| = d1.

14

Proof. By construction C ′ := (µ × µ)(C) is an irreducible curve in ˆC2 with inﬁnitely
many points in ˆR2; hence it is deﬁned over R, proving (a). Also, by assumption we have
C ∩ (∂B × B◦) = ∅, which is equivalent to C ′ ∩ ( ˆR × H) = ∅. Since C ′ is deﬁned over R,
by complex conjugation it follows that C ′ ∩ ( ˆR × (−H)) = ∅. Thus C ′ ∩ ( ˆR × ˆC) ⊂ ˆR2 and
hence C ∩ (∂B × ˆC) ⊂ (∂B)2. By symmetry we obtain (b).
Next, if one coeﬃcient of the bidegree of C were 0, the curve would have the form
{z1} × ˆC or ˆC × {z2} and we would have the case (b) or (c) of Proposition 5.1. This shows
(c).
Now consider a point ˜c ∈ ˜C with image (z1, z2) := π(˜c) ∈ ˆC2. By (b) we have z1 ∈ ∂B
if and only if z2 ∈ ∂B. Assume this to be the case. After substituting each Xj by zjXj,
we may without loss of generality assume that each zj = 1. Then µ(πj(˜c)) = 0. By (c)
the map πj is non-constant of degree d3−j. Let ej > 1 denote its ramiﬁcation degree at ˜c.
Choose a local chart of ˜C at ˜c with parameter z, such that µ(π1(z)) = ze1. Then locally
1 (∂B) = (µ ◦ π1)−1( ˆR) consists of the 2e1 rays ζR>0 for all ζ ∈ C
at ˜c, the inverse image π−1
with ζ 2e1 = 1. Likewise, locally near ˜c we have µ(π2(z)) = ze2u(z), where u is analytic at
2 (∂B) = (µ ◦ π2)−1( ˆR) thus consists of 2e2 smooth
0 with u(0) 6= 0. The inverse image π−1
curve segments emanating from ˜c. But by (b) the two inverse images coincide. Thus e1 and
e2 are equal, say to e > 1.

By the equality of the inverse images, we can now say that there exists ε > 0 such that
for all ζ ∈ C with ζ 2e = 1 and all real numbers t ∈ ]0, ε[ we have µ(π2(ζt)) = (ζt)eu(ζt) ∈ R.
Since ζ e = ±1, this is equivalent to u(ζt) ∈ R. Consider the power series expansion
u(z) = Pk>0 ukzk. Then the case ζ = 1 and the identity theorem for power series implies
that all uk ∈ R. For arbitrary ζ the condition is thus equivalent to Pk>0 uk(ζ k − ζ −k)tk =
u(ζt) − u(ζt) = 0. Therefore uk(ζ k − ζ −k) = 0 for all k > 0. Taking ζ to be a root of unity
of precise order 2e, it follows that uk = 0 for all k > 0 which are not multiples of e. This
means that u(z) = v(ze) for a second analytic function v. We conclude that locally near ˜c,
both µ◦ π1 and µ◦ π2, and hence both π1 and π2, factor through the map z 7→ ze. But since
the map π : ˜C → C is an isomorphism outside ﬁnitely many points, this is only possible
with e = 1. This proves (d).

Finally, (c) and (d) together imply (e).

(cid:3)

Now we turn to the proof of Theorem 1.9. To ease notation we rename the variables

(X1, X2) to (X, Y ). Let A denote the ring of all power series in C[[X, Y ]] satisfying

(6.2)

(cid:13)(cid:13)Pj,k ajkX jY k(cid:13)(cid:13) := Pj,k |ajk| < ∞

Equivalently this is the ring of all power series that converge absolutely on B2, or again the
Banach algebra completion of C[X, Y ] with respect to k k. For any real number 0 < r < 1
we set

(6.3)

fr(X, Y ) := f (X, rY ).

Since by assumption f vanishes nowhere on B × B◦, the polynomial fr vanishes nowhere
on B2. Thus it is non-zero on a whole neighborhood of B2, and therefore invertible in A.

15

The main point in the proof will be Proposition 6.11, which asserts that the functions f
fr
for r ր 1 constitute something like an approximate identity for the ideal (f ) (compare
Mortini-von Renteln [14, page 223]). Abbreviate ∂Y := ∂

By Proposition 6.1 (c) the polynomial f has degree d2 with respect to Y ; hence gℓ = 0 for
all ℓ > d2.

Lemma 6.5 For all ℓ and k and all x ∈ ∂B we have

|gℓk(x)| = O(cid:0)(k + 1)ℓ−1(cid:1),

where the implicit constant is independent of ℓ, k, and x.

Proof. By assumption the polynomial f (X, 0) vanishes nowhere on B. For any x ∈ ∂B
Proposition 6.1 (e) therefore shows that

f (x, Y ) = f (x, 0) · Y˜c∈π−1

|gℓk(x)| 6 |Nℓ,k(x)| = (cid:18)d2

1 (x) → Z>0 satisfying |{˜c| j(˜c) > 0}| = ℓ
1 (x) we have |π2(˜c))| = 1.

Here the right hand side is 0 for ℓ > d2, and a polynomial of degree ℓ − 1 in k otherwise.
The desired estimate follows.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.7 There exists M > 0 such that for all ℓ and k we have

Xj>kM

|aℓkj| = O(cid:0)(k + 1)ℓ−1(cid:1),

where the implicit constant is independent of ℓ and k.
Proof. Recall that by Proposition 6.1 (b) and (d), for any x ∈ ∂B and any ˜c ∈ π−1
1 (x)
we have |π2(˜c)| = 1, and π1 is unramiﬁed at ˜c. By continuity it follows that for any x in a
suitable neighborhood of ∂B and any ˜c ∈ π−1
2, and π1 is unramiﬁed
at ˜c. Also, since f (x, 0) vanishes nowhere on ∂B, the same holds in a neighborhood. Choose
ρ > 1 such that the slightly larger circle ρ·∂B is contained in both neighborhoods. Then for
all x ∈ ρ · ∂B, the formula (6.6) remains true. Using |π2(˜c)| > 1
2 it now yields the estimate

1 (x) we have |π2(˜c)| > 1

|gℓk(x)| 6 |Nℓ,k(x)| · 2ℓ+k = O(cid:0)(k + 1)ℓ−12k(cid:1).

Plugging this into the Cauchy integral formula, for any j > 0 we deduce that

|aℓkj| = O(cid:0)(k + 1)ℓ−12kρ−kM(cid:1).

Any M > 0 with ρM > 2 thus has the desired property.

Lemma 6.8 For all ℓ and k we have

where the implicit constant is independent of ℓ and k.

2(cid:1),
kgℓkk = O(cid:0)(k + 1)ℓ− 1

Proof. By (6.4) we have gℓk =Pj>0 aℓkjX j. Thus by the Parseval identity (Pj>0 |aℓkj|2)

L∞-norm of gℓk|∂B. By Lemma 6.5 it follows that

Theorem 6.12 (= 1.9) In the case (d) of Proposition 5.1, for all k > 1 we have

(f k) = g(f k) = (f ).
fr ∈ A, there exists a polynomial hr ∈ C[X, Y ] with

Proof. For each 0 < r < 1, since 1

As this tends to 0 for r ր 1, it follows that f lies in the closure of the ideal (f 2) ⊂ C[X, Y ].
By induction on k, as in the proof of Lemma 4.2, we deduce that f ∈ (f k) for all k > 1.
Using Proposition 4.8 (c) and (b) we conclude that

The desired equalities follow.

We keep n = 2.

Lemma 7.1 Consider any non-zero polynomial f ∈ C[X], any point z = (z1, z2) ∈ B2,
and any closed mz-primary ideal J $ C[X]. Then

(f ) ∩\r>1(cid:0)f J + mr

z(cid:1) =

if z ∈ ∂B × B◦ and f ∈ (X1 − z1),
if z ∈ B◦ × ∂B and f ∈ (X2 − z2),
if z ∈ (∂B)2 and f ∈ mz,

(f )

(f )
f J otherwise.




z = ((f ) ∩ J ′) + mr

z ⊂ J ′ and hence f J + mr

Proof. Call the left hand side I and note that we always have I ⊃ f J.
Suppose ﬁrst that z ∈ (B◦)2. Then for each r > 1 we have mr
z = mr
z by Theorem 1.8.
Using the primary decomposition we can write f J = (f )∩ J ′ for some mz-primary ideal J ′.
z ⊂ J ′. Thus
Then for some r > 1 we have mr
(f ) ∩(cid:0)f J + mr
z(cid:1) ⊂ (f ) ∩ J ′ = f J. This implies that I ⊂ f J and hence I = f J, as desired.
z =(cid:0)X1− z1, (X2− z2)r(cid:1)
Suppose next that z ∈ ∂B×B◦. Then for each r > 1 we have mr
by Theorem 1.8. Since J is mz-primary and closed, we also have J =(cid:0)X1 − z1, (X2 − z2)s(cid:1)
for some s > 1. For all g ∈ C[X] we deduce that
f g ∈ I ⇐⇒ ∀r > 1 : f g ∈ f ·(cid:0)X1 − z1, (X2 − z2)s(cid:1) +(cid:0)X1 − z1, (X2 − z2)r(cid:1)
⇐⇒ ∀r > 1 : (f g)(z1, X2) ∈ (cid:0)f (z1, X2) · (X2 − z2)s, (X2 − z2)r(cid:1) ⊂ C[X2].
If f (z1, X2) = 0, or equivalently f ∈ (X1 − z1), this condition always holds; hence in this
case I = (f ). Otherwise, taking r− s greater than the maximal power of (X2− z2) dividing
f (z1, X2), we ﬁnd that

f g ∈ I ⇐⇒ g(z1, X2) ∈ (cid:0)(X2 − z2)s(cid:1) ⊂ C[X2]
⇐⇒ g ∈ (cid:0)X1 − z1, (X2 − z2)s(cid:1) = J.

In this case we therefore have I = f J.

The case z ∈ B◦ × ∂B follows by symmetry from the preceding case.
Suppose ﬁnally that z ∈ (∂B)2. Then for each r > 1 we have mr

z = mz by Theorem
1.8. Since J is mz-primary and proper and closed, we also have J = mz. We deduce that
f J + mr
z = f mz + mz = mz, and hence I = (f ) ∩ mz. It follows that I = (f ) if f ∈ mz, and
I = f mz = f J otherwise. This ﬁnishes the proof in all cases.

(cid:3)

Lemma 7.2 In all cases of Lemma 7.1 we have

(f ) ∩\r>1(cid:0)f J + mr

z(cid:1) = (f ) ∩ (f J).

20

Proof. The ideals f J + mr
z are all closed by Lemma 4.5, hence they contain (f J). Calling
the left hand side I, we thus always have I ⊃ (f ) ∩ (f J) ⊃ f J. We are therefore done if
I = f J. It remains to consider the cases of Lemma 7.1 where I = (f ).
Suppose ﬁrst that z ∈ ∂B×B◦ and f ∈ (X1−z1). Write f = (X1−z1)f1 with f1 ∈ C[X].
Since (X1 − z1)r ∈ J for some r > 1, we have (X1 − z1)r+1f1 ∈ f J. But by Lemma 4.2 and
the isometric embedding C[X1] ֒→ C[X] we have (X1 − z1) ∈ ((X1 − z1)r+1). Therefore
f = (X1 − z1)f1 ∈ ((X1 − z1)r+1)f1 ⊂ (f J) and hence (f ) ∩ (f J) = (f ) = I, as desired.
The case z ∈ B◦ × ∂B and f ∈ (X2 − z2) follows by symmetry from the preceding case.
Suppose lastly that z ∈ (∂B)2 and f ∈ mz. Recall from the proof of Lemma 7.1 that
J = mz in this case. Write f = (X1 − z1)f1 + (X2 − z2)f2 with f1, f2 ∈ C[X]. By the same
argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.2, for each i = 1, 2 and all m > 1 we have

m(1 + 1) → 0 for m → ∞, whereas

(cid:13)(cid:13) = 1 for all m. In the limit we thus

(cid:3)

deduce that f ≡ 0 modulo (f J). Therefore (f ) ∩ (f J) = (f ) = I, as desired.

Lemma 7.3 In all cases of Lemma 7.1 we have

(f ) ∩ g(f J) = (f ) ∩ (f J).

Proof. Since J is mz-primary, for all points z′ ∈ B2 distinct from z and all r > 1 we
have (f ) ∩(cid:0)f J + mr
z ′(cid:1) = (f ). Thus the ideal on the left hand side of Lemma 7.2 is just
(f ) ∩ ](f J).
Theorem 7.4 For any ideal I ⊂ C[X1, X2] we have I = eI.
we deduce that eI = 0 = I, and the theorem follows. Henceforth we assume that I 6= 0.
By Proposition 4.8 (c) we can replace I by I without changing eI. Thus without loss of
Write I = f J for a non-zero polynomial f ∈ C[X] and an ideal of ﬁnite codimension
J ⊂ C[X]. Write f = Qm
i with mutually non-associate irreducible polynomials fi ∈

If I = 0, we have M(I) = B2 and hence I(M(I)) = 0. With Proposition 4.8 (b)

generality we assume that I is closed.

Proof.

Claim 7.5 For all i we have (f ki

i ) = (f ki

i ) = ](f ki
i ).

Proof. By Theorem 1.7 we have I(M(I)) = Rad(I). For each i the set M(I) therefore
contains a Zariski dense subset of the curve deﬁned by fi. Thus M((fi)) is inﬁnite, and so
fi does not belong to the case (e) of Proposition 5.1. Set k′
i := ki if fi belongs to the case
5.1 (a), and k′
i := 1 if it belongs to the cases 5.1 (b)–(d). Then by Propositions 5.2 and 5.3
and Theorem 6.12 we have

(f ki

i ) = ](f ki

i ) = (f k′

i ).

By the continuity of addition and multiplication in C[X] we deduce that

(cid:16) mYi=1

f k′

i (cid:17)J = (cid:16) mYi=1

(f ki

i )(cid:17)J ⊂ (cid:16)(cid:16) mYi=1

(f ki

Thus for all i we have k′

i > ki and hence k′

i = ki, and the claim follows.

f ki

i (cid:17)J.

Claim 7.6 We have (f ) = (f ) = f(f ).
Proof. For each i we have (f ) ⊂ (f ki
we deduce that

Now write J =Tℓ
zν ∈ C2. Then we also have J =Qℓ

ν=1 Jν.

Claim 7.7 For each ν the ideal f Jν is closed.

Proof. Since (f ) is closed by Claim 7.6, we have (f Jν) = f J +

ing Jν. Abbreviate J ′ := Qν ′6=ν Jν ′, so that f JνJ ′ = f J = I. Using continuity of addition

and multiplication, we calculate

ν for some ideal J +

f J +

ν J ′ = (f Jν)J ′ ⊂ (f Jν)J ′ = I = I = f JνJ ′.

Dividing by f and using the fact that Jν and J ′ have disjoint support, we deduce that
J +
ν ⊂ Jν. Thus J +
(cid:3)

ν = Jν and hence (f Jν) = f J +

ν = f Jν, as desired.

Claim 7.8 For each ν the ideal Jν is closed.

Proof. By continuity and Claim 7.7 we have f Jν ⊂ f · Jν ⊂ (f Jν) = f Jν. Dividing by f
yields Jν ⊂ Jν ⊂ Jν.

(cid:3)

22

Claim 7.9 For each ν we have ](f Jν) = f Jν.

Proof. Since Jν is closed, Theorem 1.8 implies that the associated point zν lies in B2. We
can therefore apply Lemma 7.3 to f and Jν, yielding

(f ) ∩ ](f Jν) = (f ) ∩ (f Jν).

By Proposition 4.8 (d) and Claim 7.6 we also have ](f Jν) ⊂ f(f ) = (f ); hence the left hand

side is just ](f Jν). On the other hand, since f Jν is closed by Claim 7.7, the right hand side
is just f Jν. Thus the desired equality follows.
(cid:3)

End of Proof. Finally, using Proposition 4.8 (b) and (d) and Claim 7.9 we conclude that

f J ⊂ ](f J) ⊂

](f Jν) =

ℓ\ν=1

ℓ\ν=1

f Jν = f J.

Thus ](f J) = f J. Since f J = I = I, it follows that I = eI. This ﬁnishes the proof of

Theorem 7.4.

8 Examples

Example 8.1 For f := X1 + X2 − 2 ∈ C[X1, X2] we have M((f )) = {(1, 1)}. This is
therefore the case (e) of Proposition 5.1 with non-empty ﬁnite M((f )) ⊂ (∂B)2. In this
case Theorem 1.10 asserts that (f ) = (X1 − 1, X2 − 1). We give a direct proof of this fact.
Proof. Since X1 + X2 ≡ 2 modulo (f ), for every m > 0 we have

gm := (X1 + X2)2m(X1 − X2) ≡ 2m(X1 − X2) modulo (f ).

Expanding gm with the binomial formula yields

gm =

It is a well-known consequence of Stirling’s formula that (cid:0)2m
m(cid:1) = O(2m/√m) as m → ∞.
Thus 2−mgm → 0 for m → ∞. Since X1 − X2 ≡ 2−mgm modulo (f ), it follows that
X1−X2 ∈ (f ). Therefore X1−1 = 1
2((X1−X2)+f ) ∈ (f ), and similarly X2−1 ∈ (f ). Thus
(X1 − 1, X2 − 1) ⊂ (f ). The reverse inclusion follows from the fact that (f ) ⊂ I(M((f ))).

Example 8.2 Fix a real number 0 < w < 1 and consider the polynomial

f := 1 + wX + wY + XY ∈ C[X, Y ].

Let C denote the closure of the aﬃne curve V (f ) in ˆC2. Its image under the M¨obius
transformation from Section 6 is the real hyperbola with the aﬃne equation UV = 1+w
1−w .
Since 1+w
1−w > 0, for any complex point on this hyperbola with one coordinate in the upper
half plane H, the other coordinate lies in the lower half plane −H. This implies that M((f ))
is inﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2, so that we are in the case (d) of Proposition 5.1.

Among the functions gℓ from (6.4), the only non-trivial one is now

Remark 8.4 The case (d) of Proposition 5.1 is not particularly rare. For example, for any
relatively prime integers d1, d2 > 1 the polynomial X d1
2 − 1 satisﬁes the conditions and
deﬁnes a smooth irreducible curve C of bidegree (d1, d2). Likewise, whenever f satisﬁes the
conditions, so does every irreducible factor of f (X d1
2 ). Moreover, the conditions are
invariant under applying a M¨obius transformation that maps B to itself in each variable
separately. Furthermore, the conditions are preserved under small deformations at least for
smooth curves, by the following result.

1 , X d2

Proposition 8.5 Let S be an algebraic variety over R, and let C → SC be an algebraic
family of smooth irreducible curves in (P1)2, such that the family obtained by applying µ×µ
is deﬁned over R. Assume that in the ﬁber over some point s0 ∈ S(R) the intersection
Cs0(C) ∩ B2 is inﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2. Then the same condition holds in the ﬁber
over all points s ∈ S(R) suﬃciently near s0.
Proof. Let C′ → S be the family of curves in (P1)2 obtained by applying µ × µ. Then
Proposition 6.1 for the curve at s0 implies that the two projection maps

pr1

P1(R)

C′
s0(R)

pr2

/ P1(R)

C′
s(C) r C′

are unramiﬁed coverings, whose degrees are equal to the respective algebraic degrees d2, d1.
By smoothness the same is true over all nearby points s ∈ S(R). Thus
s(R) ⊂ (P1(C) r P1(R))2 = (H ⊔ −H)2.
(8.6)
s(C) is a compact oriented surface of ﬁxed genus and C′
s0(C) r C′

Topologically C′
s(R) is the union of
a ﬁxed ﬁnite number of disjoint simple loops on it. By smoothness the families of both can
be trivialized locally near s0. The connected components of C′
s0(R) are therefore
in bijection with the connected components of C′
s(R) and deform continuously
into the latter within (H ⊔ −H)2. But the assumption Cs0(C) ∩ (B◦)2 = ∅ is equivalent to
C′
s0(C) ∩ H2 = ∅. Thus none of the connected components of C′
s0(R) meets H2,
s(R) meets H2. Together with (8.6)
and so none of the connected components of C′
this implies that

s0(C) r C′

s(C) r C′

s(C) r C′
s(C) ∩(cid:0)H ⊔ P1(R)(cid:1)2 = C′
C′

s(R).

Therefore Cs(C) ∩ B2 is inﬁnite and contained in (∂B)2, as desired.
