Abstract

Age at infection is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics. In this paper a disease trans-

mission model of SIS type with age dependent infection on a heterogeneous network is discussed.

The model allows the infectious rate and the recovery rate to vary and depend on the age of the

infected individual at the time of infection. We address the threshold property of the basic reproduc-

tion number and present the global dynamical properties of the disease-free and endemic equilibria

in the model. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results. The

combined effects of the network structure and the age dependent factor on the disease dynamics are

displayed.

Key words: Basic reproduction number, age-structure, scale-free network, global stability.

Introduction

Infectious diseases remain a major challenge for human society. Epidemic diseases (cholera, tubercu-

losis, SARS, inﬂuenza, Ebola virus, etc.) continue to have both a major impact on human beings and

an economic cost to society. Any gain we make in understanding the dynamics and control of epidemic

transmission therefore has potential for signiﬁcant impact — and hence has been the focus of scientiﬁc

research and attracted much attention [1, 2].

Epidemic dynamic models provide a theoretical method for quantitative studies of infectious dis-

eases. Since Kermack and Mckendrick proposed two fundamental epidemic models, the SIS and SIR

compartmental models, to study disease transmission [3, 4], epidemic models for the transmission of

infectious diseases have been studied extensively. These classical compartmental models are important

tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases, but usually neglect the population struc-

ture or assume that all the individuals have the same possibility to contact the others — they are most

effective for well-mixed homogeneous populations with a substantial penetration of infection. However,

the spreading of infectious diseases is primarily via speciﬁc contacts between individuals, emerging

diseases start with a relative small number of infectives, and the possibility to contact others is het-

erogeneous. Therefore, depicting the spread of disease processes on a contact network can be more

realistic [5–8]. Currently, the most popular transmission models on networks are based on mean-ﬁeld

approximations and follow the framework initially proposed by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [9–11].

They were the ﬁrst to study SIS and SIR epidemic models on a scale-free network and showed that the

epidemic threshold is inﬁnitesimal in the limit of a large number of links and nodes. Since then, a great

deal of epidemiological research work followed on scale-free (and other) networks [12–17].

For some epidemic diseases, such as scarlet fever, poliomyelitis and HFMD (hand-foot-and-mouth),

the process of their transmission is related to age and some public health and preventative policies for

those diseases depend on the age structure of host population. Hence, in order to reﬂect the effect

of demographic behavior of individuals, researchers have begun to examine age-structured epidemic

models. The pioneering work in age-structured epidemic models was that of Hoppensteadt [18, 19],

since then, the importance of age structure in epidemic models has been recently stressed by many

authors [20–23]. Although age-dependent epidemic models have been studied extensively, all these

models were established on homogeneous networks — in essence a convenient approximation to the

homogeneous well-mixed population. There are still few signiﬁcant results concerning age-structured

epidemic models on complex (in this case, scale-free) networks.

The main purpose of this paper is to obtain threshold results for an age-structured epidemic model

on scale-free networks. A scale-free network is characterized by a power-law degree distribution p(k) ∼

2

k−r [24], where p(k) is the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree k, and r is a characteristic

exponent whose value is usually in the range 2 < r ≤ 3. We know that for many infectious diseases,

transmission can be studied by using the SIS model with S and I representing the susceptible and infected

individuals, respectively. Based on the SIS model with age structure, our work provides new insight into

epidemic spreading dynamics.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present our age-of-infection model and

give some description and assumptions. In Section 3, we analyze the existence of equilibria and obtain

the basic reproduction number. We then present some preliminaries for the analysis of stability, which

includes asymptotic smoothness of the semi-ﬂow generated by the system and the uniform persistence

of the system. The main results of this paper are given in Section 4, which include the local stability and

global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Some numerical analysis are performed in

Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we give conclusions and discussions.

2 Formulation of the model

Consider a population with connectivity modelled as a complex network N, where each node of N is

either vacant or occupied by one individual. In an epidemic spreading process, every node has three

optional states: vacant state, susceptible state, and, infected state [25, 26].

In order to consider the

heterogeneity of contacts, we divide the population into n groups. Let Sk(t), Ik(t), (k = 1, 2, ...n)

denote the densities of susceptible and infected nodes (individuals) with connectivity (degree) k at time

t, respectively, and let Ik(t, τ ) denote the density of infected individuals with respect to the age of

infection τ at time t. It is obvious that

Ik(t) = Z ∞

0

Ik(t, τ )dτ

Noting that Sk(t) + R ∞0 Ik(t, τ )dτ = Nk(t) , which describes the total density of the individuals with

degree k at time t, then, the density of the vacant nodes with degree k is 1 − Sk − Ik(t).

In addition, as a disease spreads, a birth event occurs at a vacant node next to a non-vacant node at

rate b, that is to say, the empty nodes will give birth to new individuals once one of their neighbours is

occupied. Thus, the birth process depends on the number of neighboring individuals. All individuals die

at rate µ, causing the occupied node becomes vacant. Let β(τ ), γ(τ ) represent infectious function and

3

removal function with respect to age of infection τ respectively. Therefore, the SIS epidemic model with

the age-of-infection structure on a heterogeneous network is formulated as follows:

where L1

+(0, ∞) is the space of functions on [0, ∞) that are nonnegative and Lebesgue integrable.

(2.1)

(2.2)

The meaning of the parameters and variables of the above model are as follows:

• Let b and µ be positive constants denoting the birth and natural death rates of all individuals. The

additional death rate induced by the infectious disease is not considered.

• hki is the average degree of the network, i.e., hki = Pn
this is deﬁned as hδ(k)i = Pn

i=1 ip(i). For a general function δ(k) ,
i=1 δ(i)p(i). Let p(i|k) be the probability that a node of degree k is
connected to a node of degree i. In present paper, we primarily study epidemic transmissions on

uncorrelated networks, the probability is considered independent of the connectivity of the node

from which the link is emanating. Therefore, P (i|k) = iP (i)
hki

.

• Θk(t, τ ) describes the probability of a link pointing to an infected individual of age τ . We note that

ϕ(k) is the infectivity of nodes with degree k, i.e., it denotes the average number of edges from

which a node with degree k can transmit the disease. Thus, kSk(t)R ∞0 β(τ )Θk(t, τ )dτ represents

newly infected individuals per unit time.

• Ψk = Pn

i=1 p(i|k) A

its neighbours with degree i. The factor 1

i Ni(t) is the probability of fertility contacts between nodes with degree k and
i accounts for the probability that one of the neighboring
individual of a vacant node with degree i, will activate this vacant node at the present time step.

4

It is assumed that, at each time step, every individual generates the same birth contacts A, here

A = 1 [26]. Therefore, bk[1 − Nk(t)]Ψk represents density of new born individuals per unit time.

Next we make the following assumptions on parameters, which are thought to be biologically rele-

vant.

Assumption 2.1 Consider the system (2.1), we assume that,

1. b, µ > 0;

2. β(τ ), γ(τ )ǫL1

+(0, +∞), with respective essential upper bounds β and γ. Furthermore, there exists

a constant α > 0 such that β(τ ), γ(τ ) ≥ α for all τ ≥ 0;

3. β(τ ), γ(τ ) are Lipschitz continuous on R+ with Lipschitz coefﬁcients Mβ and Mγ, respectively;

4. For all a ≥ 0 and any k, Ik0(a) > 0 . Furthermore,

Ik0(a) < +∞.

a→∞

Let us deﬁne a functional space for system (2.1),

X = X1 × X2 × . . . × Xn, Xi = R1

+ × L1

+, i = 1, 2, · · · n.

Note that X is a closed subset of a Banach space, and hence is a complete metric space. The norm on

Xk is taken to be

kXkk = |Sk(t)| +Z ∞

0

|Ik(t, τ )|dτ

By applying tools from [27, 28] and following from Assumption 2.1, it can be veriﬁed that the solution

of system (2.1) exists and is nonnegative for any initial conditions. Thus, for t ≥ 0 deﬁne a continuous

ﬂow Ξ(t): X → X of system (2.1) such that

Ξ(t, X0) = ̺(t, X0) = (S1(t), I1(t, τ ), S2(t), I2(t, τ ), . . . , Sn(t), In(t, τ ))

where ̺(t, X0) is the solution of the model (2.1) with initial condition X0 ∈ X.

From the model (2.1), we get that Nk satisﬁes the following differential equation,

dNk(t)

dt

= bk[1 − Nk(t)]Ψ − µNk(t)

(2.3)

Let dNk(t)

dt = 0 ,we get Nk = 0, which corresponds to the equilibrium solution of extinction, and another

solution satisﬁes

Nk =

bkΨ

µ + bkΨ

(2.4)

Putting the above equation (2.4) to Ψ, we obtain

Therefore, from (2.3) and [38], when b ≤ µ , there is lim

and there is no other dynamic behaviors any more. While, when b > µ, lim

we only consider the condition of b > µ in the following sections.

Nk(t) = 0, the population becomes extinct

Since there are the same long-playing behaviors between the original system and the limiting sys-

∂τ = −(µ + γ(τ ))Ik(t, τ )

Ik(t, τ )dτ ≤ 1, k = 1, · · · , n}

(2.5)

The following proposition shows that Γ is positively invariant with respect to system (2.5) for Ξ.

Proposition 2.1 Γ is positively invariant of system (2.5) for Ξ . Moreover, Ξ is point dissipative (there

exists a bounded set Γ ⊂ X which attracts all points in X). That is , ∀ t ≥ 0 , for any the solution of

system (2.5), noting as Φ(t, X0) ,with the initial condition X0 ∈ Γ. Then Φ(t, X0) ∈ Γ.

Proof Deﬁne the arbitrary initial condition X0 ∈ Γ, which satisﬁes (2.2). Thus, ∀t > 0, Nk0 ≥

Therefore, Ξ is point dissipative and Γ attracts all points in X . This completes the proof.

According to Assumption 2.1 and the above results, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 2.2 There exists a constant Λ satisﬁed Λ > 1, then the following statements hold true for

∀t ≥ 0 and k(k=1,2,...n):

Ik(t, τ )dτ < Λ;

3 Preliminaries

3.1 Equilibria and the basic reproduction number

Firstly, with the above boundary conditions and initial conditions (2.2) , we obtain I(t, τ ) by integrating

the second differential equation in (2.5) along the characteristic line t − τ = constant [29],

Next, we consider the steady states of system (2.5). For simplicity, we note Zk(t) = Ik(t, 0), (k =

In order to prove the global stability of model (2.5), we need to make the following preparations. First, we

establish asymptotic smoothness of the semigroup Ξ(t). The semigroup Ξ(t) is asymptotically smooth,

8

if, for any nonempty, closed and bounded set B ⊂ X for which Ξ(t,B)⊂ B, there is a compact set J ⊂ B

such that J attracts B. In order to obtain it, we will need the following lemmas and proposition.

Lemma 3.1 ( [30]) For each t > 0, suppose Ξ(t) = Ψ(t) + Υ(t) : Γ → Γ has the property that Ψ(t)

is completely continuous and there is a continuous function k:R+ × R+ → R+: such that k(t, r) → 0

as t → ∞ and kΥ(t)X0k ≤ k(t, r) if kX0k < r. Then Ξ(t), t ≥ 0, is asymptotically smooth.

Lemma 3.2 ( [31]) Let K ⊂ Lp

+(0, +∞) be closed and bounded where p ≥ 1. Then K is compact if

and only if the following conditions hold:

|u(z + h) − u(z)|pdz = 0 uniformly for u ∈ K. (u(z + h) = 0 if z + h < 0).

(i) limh→0R ∞0
(ii) limh→∞R ∞h |u(z)|pdz = 0 uniformly for u ∈ K.
Proposition 3.1 Let J ⊂ R. For j = 1, 2, suppose that fj : J → R is a bounded Lipschitz continuous

function with bound Kj and Lipschitz coefﬁcient Mj. Then the product function f1 · f2 is Lipschitz

continuous with coefﬁcient K1M2 + K2M1.

From the above two lemmas, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2 The semigroup Ξ is asymptotically smooth.

Proof To apply Lemma 3.1, we deﬁne the projection of Ξ(t) about any bounded set of X by decom-

posing Ξ(t) into the following two operators,

Ξ(t) = U (t) + C(t)

where,

U (t) = (0, U1(t), 0, U2(t), . . . , 0, Un(t)), C(t) = (S1(t), C1(t), S2(t), C2(t), . . . , Sn(t), Cn(t))

If kX0k < r, we note k(t, r) = re−(µ+α)t, then, k(t, r) → 0 as t → ∞ and kUi(t)k ≤ k(t, r) for any i.

Next, we verify that C(t) is completely continuous. We need to pay more attention to the state space,

since L1

+(0, +∞) is a component of our state space X. Hence a notion of compactness in L1

+(0, +∞)

is necessary. In an inﬁnite dimensional Banach space, boundedness does not necessarily imply precom-

pactness. Hence, we need to prove it by applying Lemma3.2.

Suppose that B ⊂ X is bounded for any initial condition X0 ⊂ B. From Proposition 2.1, it is easy

to see that Sk(t), (k = 1, 2, ..n) remains in the compact set [0, Λ]. Thus, we only need to verify that the

following conditions valid for Ci(t)(i = 1, 2, ..n) remaining in a precompact subset of L+(0, +∞) .

Lemma 3.1, we conclude that Ξ(t, X0) is asymptotically smooth. This completes the proof.

Next, we show that the solution semigroup Ξ has a global compact attractor A in Γ.

We ﬁrst give the following deﬁnition of global attractors.

Deﬁnition 1 ( [30]) A set A in Γ is deﬁned to be an attractor if A is non-empty, compact and invariant,

and there exists some open neighborhood W of A in Γ such that A attracts W . A global attractor is

deﬁned to be an attractor which attracts every point in Γ.

11

From the results above, we can get the existence of a global attractor by applying the following Lemma.

Lemma 3.3 ( [30])

If Ξ is asymptotically smooth and point dissipative in Γ, and orbits of bounded sets

are bounded in Γ, then there is a global attractor A in Γ.

Propositions 2.1 and Theorem 3.2 show that the semigroup Ξ(t) of system (2.5) is asymptotically smooth

and point dissipative on the state space Γ. The proof of Proposition 2.1 can verify that every forward

orbit of bounded sets is bounded in Γ. Therefore, by Lemma 3.3, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.3 The semigroup Ξ generated by the system (2.5) on the state space Γ has a global attractor

A in Γ.

3.3 Uniform Persistence

In this section we study the uniform persistence of system (2.5). Let us deﬁne a function ρ : X → R that

ρ = (ρ1, ρ2, ..., ρn) as

ρk(X) = Zk(t), k = 1, 2, . . . n

Before introducing the result of persistence, we introduce the following important lemmas.

Lemma 3.4 (Fatou’s Lemma) Let fn be a non-negative measurable function sequence, then it satisﬁes

Z

lim
t→+∞

inf fn ≤ lim
t→+∞

inf Z fn ≤ lim
t→+∞

supZ fn ≤ Z

(3.4)

Lemma 3.5 (Fluctuation Lemma) Let

sup Φ(t) = Φ∞,

lim
t→+∞

lim
t→+∞

inf Φ(t) = Φ∞

and Φ(t) be a bounded and continuously differentiable function. Then there exist sequences fn and gn
such that fn → ∞, gn → ∞, Φ(fn) → Φ∞, Φ(gn) → Φ∞. Φ′(fn) → 0, Φ′(gn) → 0, as n → ∞.

Lemma 3.6 If R0 > 1, then there exists a positive constant ε > 0, such that for any k,

Zk(t) > ε

lim sup
t→∞

(3.5)

Proof

If R0 > 1, there exists a sufﬁciently small ε > 0 such that

(3.6)

We now show that this small ε is the ε in (3.5). We will do this by contradiction. Assume that there exists

a constant T > 0 which is sufﬁciently large such that

Zk(t) ≤ ε

f or t ≥ T

Together with (2.5), we have

Then , according to the comparison principle,

Sk(t) ≥

bk[1 − N∗k (t)]Ψ∗ − ε

f or t ≥ T

(3.7)

Furthermore, it follows from (3.1) together with (3.7) and the Fluctuation Lemma, if gn is a sequence
such that Zk(gn) → Zk∞, we have

Zk(gn) ≥ k

which contradicts to (3.6). That is to say, the system (2.5) is uniformly weakly ρ- persistent. The proof

is therefore complete.

Suppose a total trajectory of Ξ in space X is a function η: R → X, such that f (s + t) = Ξ(t, f (s)),

for t ≥ 0, s ∈ R. Then, by applying Theorem 3.3, Lemma 3.5 and [32], we have the following result.

Theorem 3.4 If R0 > 1, Ξ(t) is uniformly strongly ρ-persistent, that is, there exists a sufﬁciently small
ε > 0 such that lim inf t→∞ Zk(t) > ε.

Finally, we introduce the result for uniform persistence of system (2.5).

13

Theorem 3.5 If R0 > 1, Ξ(t) is uniform persistence, then, there exists a constant ε > 0 such that for

any initial condition X0 ∈ X and any k,

By using the Jacobian matrix and its characteristic equation, we have the following theorem:

Theorem 4.6

If R0 < 1,

the disease-free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable; and it is

unstable while R0 > 1.

Proof First, linearizing (4.2) near E0 by denoting the perturbation variables Sk(t) = ˜Sk(t)+S0
˜Zk(t), Θ1(t) = θ(t), we obtain the following system

It is obvious that |G(λ)| < 1 is contradictory to G(λ) = 1. Thus, G(λ) = 1 doesn’t have positive

solutions. So all roots of the characteristic equation are negative. Therefore, this means that if R0 < 1,

the disease-free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable.

fore, when R0 > 1, G(λ) = 1 has positive real part, that is to say, E0 is unstable. This completes the

proof.

Next, we discuss the local stability of the positive equilibrium. We have the following Theorem.

Theorem 4.7

If R0 > 1, system (4.2) has a unique positive equilibrium point E∗ = (S∗k, Z∗k ), k =

1, 2, ..., n, and it is locally stable.

Proof The existence of the positive equilibrium has been obtained in Section 3. As the same method

applied in the discussion of the stability of disease-free equilibrium. First, linearizing the system (4.2)

near E∗, that is, Sk(t) = S∗k + ˜Sk(t), Zk(t) = Z∗k + ˜Zk(t), we get the following linear system

To sum up, (4.8) do not have roots with positive real parts, therefore, all the roots of (4.8) have

negative real parts. Therefore, the endemic equilibrium E∗ is locally asymptotically stable if R0 > 1.

The proof is complete.

4.2 Global stability of equilibria

In this section, we ﬁrst study the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium E0 by using the Fluctu-

ation Lemma and Fatou’s Lemma [33]. We have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.8

If R0 < 1 , the disease-free equilibrium E0 of the system (2.5) is globally asymptotically

stable.

In the following, we verify the global stability of E∗ of the system (4.2) by Lyapunov-LaSalle asymp-

totic stability theorem for the semiﬂow Ξ(t). Now, to simplify the model (2.5), we let γ(τ ) = γ be a

constant. Since Sk(t) + R ∞0 Ik(t, τ )dτ = N∗k , hence we have R ∞0 Ik(t, τ )dτ = N∗k − Sk(t). For

stable.

Proof Firstly, we introduce the following important function, which is obtained from the linear combi-

nation of Volterra-type functions of the form

g(x) = x − 1 − ln x

Obviously, g(x) ≥ 0 for x > 0 and g′(x) = 1 − 1/x. Then, g(x) has a global minimum at x = 1 and

g(1) = 0. That is to say, g(x) is nonnegative.

Finally, according to Corollary 3.3 and Theorem 3.1 in [34], Vk, Υki, Gki, aki satisfy the assumptions.
Therefore, the function V = Pk ckVk which is deﬁned in Corollary 3.3 is a Lyapunov function for
system (4.9). It is obvious that V ′(t) ≤ 0 for the model (4.9) and (S1, I1(t, τ ), · · · , Sn, In(t, τ )) ∈ Γ.

23

In addition, the largest invariant set for V ′(t) = 0 is E∗. Then, the positive solution of system (4.9)

is globally asymptotically stable according to Theorem 5.3.1 and Corollary 5.3.1 in [35]. The proof is

therefore completed.

5 Simulations

We know that the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria depends on the basic reproduction

number. Here we present numerical simulations to explore the effects of various parameters on the basic

reproduction number, and to support the analytic results obtained in the previous sections.

To simulate the process of system (2.1), we ﬁrst adopt a ﬁrst-order upwind scheme with forward

Euler time step to process the second PDEs of (2.1); Consequently, we use a Runge-Kutta scheme to

deal with the ﬁrst ODEs of (2.1). The partition of mesh is ∆t = 0.1 and ∆τ = 0.2, which satisﬁes the

Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability restriction condition for PDEs.

Our simulations are based on scale-free uncorrelated networks with the degree distribution p(k) =

ck−r, where r = 2.4, and the constant c satisﬁes Σn
The initial values Sk(0) = 0.6, Ik(0, τ ) = 1√2π

k=1k−r = 1. We set the maximum degree n = 40.
for any degree k. The other parameters are

−(τ +1.15)2

First, Fig. 1 depicts the inﬂuence of ϕ(k) on R0 where ϕ(k) is the infectivity of the disease. This

function has many potential forms, such as ϕ(k) = k [9, 11], which means that the number of the

contacts per unit time is equal to the node’s degree k; ϕ(k) = h [36], which means that the number of

the contacts per unit time is equal to the constant h and has no relation with the node’s degree; or (for

example), ϕ(k) = ωka

1+νka [37]. Here, we discuss out results assuming this general form. Fig. 1 shows
that R0 is monotonically increasing as α increases. The bigger a is and the smaller b is, the bigger R0 is.

This implies that the contact method can inﬂuence disease transition — as expected.

Next, we present the evolution of Ik(t) over time under different parameters from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3

with the infectivity ϕ(k) = k, where Ik(t) = R ∞0 Ik(t, τ )dτ . Fig. 2 shows that the evolutions of the den-
sity of infection with regard to time and degree under the parameters chosen as β(τ ) = τ (200−τ )
15000 , γ(τ ) =
1
1+τ , which ensures that R0 < 1. Fig. 2(a) shows that the time series of I10, I20, I30 and I40. Fig. 2(b)

24

depicts the overall trend of infection with all degrees. They clearly demonstrate that when R0 < 1 the

disease will gradually die out, and the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. That is,

Ik(t) = 0. In addition, we conclude that the larger the degree, the higher the peak of infection.

lim
t→+∞

In Fig. 3, we show the evolution of Ik(t) over time with infectivity ϕ(k) = k under the parameters

chosen as β(τ ) = τ (200−τ )

1+10τ , the basic reproduction number satisﬁes R0 > 1. In this case,
simulation indicates that the disease eventually become endemic, and tends to the endemic equilibrium

15000 , γ(τ ) = 1

which is globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, the larger the degree, the higher the endemic level.

Therefore, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 can support the results obtained in previous sections, and ensure the global

stability when γ(τ ) is not an constant.

6 Conclusions and discussions

In this paper, we propose and analyze an SIS epidemic model with age-structure on scale-free networks.

By using various analytic methods, we demonstrate the asymptotic smoothness of solutions and uniform

persistence of the system (2.1) via analyzing its limiting system (2.5) with Volterra integral equations.

We found that the basic reproduction number is not only related to the network structure, but also de-

pends on parameters which relate to each individual’s age. In addition, we showed that the disease-free

equilibrium in model (2.5) is globally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 by analyzing the corresponding

characteristic equations and applying Fatou’s Lemma. Meanwhile, if R0 > 1, the system has a unique

endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable by constructing proper Volterra-type Lya-

punov functionals. Finally, we performed some simulations under different parameters and ϕ(k), which

conﬁrmed our theoretical results.

The factor of age-structure is necessary when study some particular diseases, therefore, in order to

analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases more realistically, our

ﬁndings in this paper are valuable for the further study of age-structured models on complex networks.
