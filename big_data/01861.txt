A reﬁnement of Betti numbers and homology in the presence of a

continuous function II (the case of an angle valued map).

Dan Burghelea ∗

Abstract

This paper is a sequel to [2]. We propose reﬁnements of the Novikov-Betti numbers of the Novikov
homology (w.r. to aﬁeld κ) of a pair (X, ξ) consisting of a compact ANR X and a degree one integral
cohomology class ξ, in the presence of a continuous angle valued map representing the cohomology
class ξ.

The ﬁrst reﬁnement consists of ﬁnite conﬁgurations of points with multiplicity located in T = R2/Z
which can be identiﬁed to the punctured complex plane, of total cardinality the Novikov-Betti numbers;
equivalently of monic polynomials with nonzero free coefﬁcient.

The reﬁnement of Novikov homology consists in conﬁgurations of free modules over the ring of
Laurent polynomials with coefﬁcients in the ﬁeld κ, indexed by the points of the previous conﬁgurations,
each of rank equal to the multiplicity of the point.

In case κ is the ﬁeld of complex numbers these conﬁgurations of free modules can be canonically
converted into conﬁgurations of Hilbert modules over the von Neumann algebra of the group Z, all
closed submodules of the L2−homology of the inﬁnite cyclic cover deﬁned by the angle valued map.

A number of properties of these conﬁgurations are discussed.

This paper is a sequel of [2] and we suppose the reader familiar with the notations and the basic concepts

additional speciﬁcations we assume that for such map the space X is a compact ANR and f is a continuous
map. In this case the map f determines a degree one integral cohomology class ξf ∈ H 1(X; Z).

As in part I we ﬁx a ﬁeld κ and an integer r, r = 0, 1, 2, dim X, and provide ﬁrst a conﬁgurations δf

r of
ﬁnitely many points with speciﬁed multiplicity located in the space T := R2/Z 1 which can be identiﬁed
to the punctured plane C \ 0. It will be shown that the set of points (counted with multiplicity) of this
conﬁguration has cardinality the Novikov–Betti number βN
r (X; ξf ). In view of the identiﬁcation of T with
C \ 0 the conﬁguration δf
r can be interpreted as a monic polynomial with complex coefﬁcients and nonzero
free term, P f
r (z), of degree the Novikov–Betti number whose roots are the points of the conﬁguration δf
r ;
however this will be used in this paper only for notational simpliﬁcations.

As in part I (reference [2]) we reﬁne the conﬁguration δf

r of κ[t−1, t]−free
modules (each one a quotient of split free submodules of the r−th Novikov homology of (X; ξf )) and in
case κ = C to the conﬁguration ˆˆδf
r of closed Hilbert submodules of L2−homology of ˜X, the inﬁnite cyclic
cover of X deﬁned by ξ. Each ˆˆδf
r (z), z ∈ C \ 0, 2 is a Hilbert module over the ﬁnite von Neumann algebra
L∞(S1) of von Neumann dimension equal to δf

r to the conﬁguration ˆδf

r (z).

The results about these conﬁgurations formulated in Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are formally similar
to Theorems 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 in part I, but conceptually more complex and technically more difﬁcult to
conclude. There are however a number of differences and new features which deserve to be pointed out.

Item 2. a) indicates that δf

with multiplicity located in C \ 0 = T of cardinality N. This space equipped with the collision topology

isomorphisms

P Dr(ha, bi) : ˆδf

intertwines the conﬁguration ˆˆδf

r (ha, bi) with ˆˆδf

n−r(hb, ai).

Item 1. was ﬁrst established in [4]. The isomorphism claimed in Item 2. is not canonical; it depends on the
choices of splittings.
Item 3. will be discuss in this paper only informally. It requires a number of additions too long to be reviewed
in full details and is actually part of a more general discussion on Poincar´e Duality and reﬁnements planned
for a future paper.

Last section of the paper uses the Poincar´e Duality for Novikov homology discussed in relation with
the proof of Theorem 1.3 to conclude a few result about the Novikov–Betti numbers, the Betti numbers and
the Jordan cells for some compact manifolds , cf Corollary 6.2, of possibly of relevance for the topology
of complements of complex hypersurfaces. None of these results are new, at least in case of complement
of hyper surfaces, but most likely derived by a different approach. At this point we thank L.Maxim for
challenging questions and informations about some of his work.

Angles and angle valued maps
An angle is a complex number θ = eit ∈ C, t ∈ R and the set of all angles is denoted by S1 = {θ =

eit | t ∈ R}. The space of angles, S1, is equipped with the distance

d(θ2, θ1) = inf{|t2 − t1| | eit1 = θ1, eit2 = θ2}.

One has d(θ1, θ2) ≤ π. With this description S1 is an oriented one dimensional manifold with the orientation
provided by a speciﬁed generator u of H1(S1; Z), the inﬁnite cyclic group.

A closed interval in I ⊂ S1 with ends the angles θ1 = eit1 and θ2 = eit2 is the set I := {eit | t1 ≤ t ≤

t2, t2 − t1 < 2π}.

More general conﬁgurations
If A is a unital ring without any additional speciﬁcation a conﬁguration of free A−modules indexed by

points in X is a map with ﬁnite support ˆω : X  free A−modules. This set is denoted by CA(X).

If V is a ﬁnite generated free A−module and P(V ) denotes the collection of split submodules 4 of V a
more interesting set denoted by CV (X) can be considered and referred to as the set of conﬁgurations of split
submodules of V.

CV (X) : {ˆω : X → P(V ) |

Px∈X ˆω(x) = V

ˆω ∈ CA(X)
for any x, {ˆω(x)} linearly independent

}

It comes equipped with a topology deﬁned by specifying for each element a system of fundamental neigh-
borhoods (as described in [2] in case A is a ﬁeld). A fundamental neighborhood of a conﬁguration ˆω ∈
CV (X) with support {x1, x2, · · · xk} and values ˆω(xi) = Vi is speciﬁed by a collection of disjoint open sets
of X, (U1, U2, · · · Uk), each Ui neighborhood of xi, and consists of

{ˆδ ∈ CV (X) | Xx∈Ui∩suppˆδ

ˆδ(x) = Vi}5.

This topology is referred to as the ﬁne collision topology.

If N is a ﬁnite von -Neumann algebra and V is a ﬁnite type N −Hilbert module, then P(V ) will denote

the collection of closed Hilbert submodules of V and CO

V (X) the set

CO

V (X) := {ˆω : X → P(V ) |


♯(supp ˆω) < ∞
ˆω(x) ⊥ ˆω(y), x 6= y

}.

Px∈X ˆω(x) = V

This set is referred to as the conﬁgurations of mutually orthogonal closed submodules of V . In this case one
can consider in addition to the ﬁne collision topology a second and coarser topology, the natural collision
topology. A fundamental neighborhood of ˆδ is speciﬁed by (U1, U2, · · · Uk; O1, O2, · · · Ok), Ui as before
and Oi open neighborhood of Vi in Gki(V ). Here Gk(V ) denotes the subset of closed Hilbert submodules
of V of von Neumann dimension k equipped with the obvious topology 6 . The neighborhood consists of

conﬁgurations ˆδ′ with the property thatPx∈Ui∩supp ˆδ′

ˆδ′(x) ∈ Oi.

4a submodule V ′ of V is split if the inclusion V ′ ⊆ V has a a left inverse

6the topology induced by the distance between bounded operators in Hilbert space; any such submodule corresponds to a

selfadjoint projector

Special conﬁgurations
Let V be a free f.g. A−module, with A a unital (commutative) ring. A subquotient of V is a pair
ω = (W, W ′), with W ′ ⊂ W split submodules of V. For each such subquotient ω one considers the free
module ˆω = W/W ′. Call splitting any linear map iω : W/W ′ → W which is a right inverse of the
canonical projection πω : W → W/W ′, i.e. πω · iω = id. A splitting of ω realizes the quotient W/W ′ as a
split submodule of W and then of V.

Given two different subquotients ω1 = (W1, W ′

2) one writes ω1 ≤ ω2 whenW1 ⊆
W2. Denote by ˜P(V ) the collection of subquotients of V to which we add the symbol 0 as a symbol for the
”trivial” subquotient.

1) and ω2 = (W2, W ′

A special conﬁguration of subquotients of V indexed by points in the space X is given by a map
˜ω : X → ˜P(V ) with ﬁnite support and different values for different points in the support, which satisﬁes
properties P1., P2., P3. below.

Let ωα = (Wα, W ′

α), α ∈ A be the set of nontrivial subquotients which appear as values of ˜ω. The set

A is ﬁnite. For any α ∈ A denote by Aα := {β ∈ A | ωβ ≤ ωα}.

P1. For any subset B ⊆ Aα \ α, Pβ∈B Wβ ⊂ Wα ⇒Pβ∈B Wβ ⊂ W ′
P2. For any subset B ⊆ Aα \ α, Pβ∈B Wβ ∩ Wα ⊆Pβ∈B Wβ ∩ W ′
P3. For any α ∈ A, Pβ∈Aα rank(ˆωβ) = rankWα and Pα∈A rank(ˆωα) = rankV .

Any special conﬁguration ˜ω provides a conﬁguration of free modules ˆ˜ω(x) = W (x)/W ′(x) with

α .
α .

⊕x∈supp ˜ωW (x)/W ′(x) ≃ V,

and once a collection of splittings iα := iωα : Wα/W ′
α → Wα is given, one can realize these free modules
inside V and convert the special conﬁguration into a conﬁguration split free submodules of V. Of course the
realization is not unique and different splittings lead to different conﬁgurations. To check this one shows
ﬁrst that for any α the submodules iβ(ˆωβ) ⊂ Wα are linearly independent using P1. and P2.
, and that

Pβ∈Aα iβ(ˆωβ) = Wα andPβ∈A iβ(ˆωβ) = V using P 3..

In case A is the ﬁeld C or R and V is a Hilbert space each subquotient (W (x), W ′(x)) has a canonical
splitting, deﬁned by the orthogonal complement of W ′(x) in W (x). The canonical splittings deﬁned using
orthogonality permit to convert this conﬁguration into an element ˆ˜ω ∈ CO

V (X).

Inﬁnite cyclic cover
For an angle valued map f : X → S1 let f ∗ : H 1(S1; Z) → H 1(X; Z) be the homomorphism induced
by f in integral cohomology let and ξf = f ∗(u) ∈ H 1(X; Z). The assignment f   ξf establishes a bijec-
tive correspondence between the set of homotopy classes of continuous maps from X to S1 and H 1(X; Z).

Recall the following:
- An inﬁnite cyclic cover of X is a map π : ˜X → X together with a free action µ : Z × ˜X → ˜X such
that π(µ(n, x)) = π(x) and the map induced by π from ˜X/Z to X is a homeomorphism. An inﬁnite cyclic
cover is said to be associated to ξ if any continuous proper map ˜f : ˜X → R which satisﬁes ˜f (µ(n, x)) =
˜f (x) + 2πn induces a map f : X → R/2πZ = S1 with ξf equal to ξ.

- For two inﬁnite cyclic covers πi : ˜Xi → X associated to ξ there exists homeomorphisms ω : ˜X1 →

˜X2 which intertwine the free actions µ1 and µ2 and satisfy π2 · ω = π1.

- Given π : ˜X → X, µ : Z × ˜X → ˜X an inﬁnite cyclic cover and f : X → S1 an angle valued map
the map ˜f : ˜X → R is a called a lift of f if ˜f (µ(n, x)) = ˜f (x) + 2πn and by passing to the quotients

6

X = ˜X/Z and S1 = R/Z the map f induces exactly f. A lift ˜f provides the following pull back diagram

R

˜f

p

/ S1

(1)

where p(t) is given by p(t) = eit ∈ S1.

- Given f : X → S1 there exists a canonical inﬁnite cyclic cover associated to ξf , the pullback of

p : R → S1 by f, precisely ˜X = {x, r) | f (x) = p(t)} and ˜f (x, t) = t.

Observation 2.1

1. Any map f : X → S1 has lifts. Two lifts of f , ˜f1 and ˜f2 differ by a deck transformation, i.e. there

exists k ∈ Z with f2 = f1 · µ(k, · · · ).

2. If f, g : X → S1 are two maps with D(f, g) < π then they are homotopic and if ˜f is a lift of f there

exists a lift ˜g of g such that D( ˜f , ˜g) = D(f, g).

3. If D(f1, f2) < π, f1, f2 : X → S1, then there exists a canonical homotopy ft : X → S1. This
homotopy has lifts ˜ft, which satisfy ˜ft = t ˜f1 + (1 − t) ˜f2 for any pair ˜f1, ˜f2, of lifts which satisfy
D( ˜f1, ˜f2) = D(f1, f2). Moreover for the canonical homotopy and any sequence 1 = t0 < t1 < t2 <

· · · tk < tk+1 = 1 one has D(f1, f2) =P0≤i≤k D(fti, fi+1).

Tame angle valued maps, critical values
For an angle valued map f : X → S1 consider ˜f : ˜X → R an inﬁnite cyclic cover. The map f is
weakly tame, resp. tame, resp. homologically tame if so is ˜f . If X is a ﬁnite simplicial complex then a map
f : X → S1 is called p.l (piecewise linear) if for some and then any lift ˜f : ˜X → R is a p.l. An angle θ ∈ S1
is a regular value, resp. critical value, resp. homologically critical value if θ = eit with t a regular value,
resp. critical value resp. homologically value for ˜f . The above deﬁnitions are independent on the lift. Since
an inﬁnite cyclic cover of a map f : X → S1 is proper the set of homological critical values is discrete and
2π−periodic and therefore is homologically tame w.r. to any ﬁeld.

Novikov homology:
Let κ be a ﬁeld and let κ[t−1, t] be the κ−algebra of Laurent polynomials with coefﬁcients in κ. This
is a commutative algebra which is an integral domain and a principal ideal domain. For a pair (X, ξ)
ξ ∈ H 1(X; Z), X a compact ANR, let ˜X be the associated inﬁnite cyclic cover and let τ : ˜X → ˜X be
the positive generator of the group of deck transformation Z viewed as a homeomorphism of ˜X. Since X is
compact, the κ−vector space Hk( ˜X) is actually a ﬁnitely generated κ[t−1, t]−module whose multiplication
by t is given by the linear isomorphism induced by the homeomorphism τ.

Since κ[t−1, t] is a PID the collection of torsion elements form a κ[t−1, t]−submodule Vr(X; ξ) :=
Torsion (Hr( ˜X)) = THr( ˜M) (usually referred to as monodromy) which as a κ− vector space is of ﬁnite
dimension. The quotient module Hr( ˜X)/T (Hr( ˜X)) is a ﬁnitely generated free κ[t−1, t]−module. In this
paper this free κ[t−1, t]−module and its rank are called the Novikov homology and the Novikov–Betti number
and are denoted by H N

r (X; ξ) and βN

r (X; ξ).

Since κ[t−1, t] is a principal ideal domain one has Hr( ˜X) ≃ Vr(X; ξ) ⊕ H N

r (X; ξ). 7

7classically, the Novikov homology is the κ[t−1, t]]− vector space Hr( ˜X)⊗κ[t−1,t] κ[t−1, t]] with κ[t−1, t]] the ﬁeld of Laurent

power series; clearly βN

r = dim(H N

r ( ˜X) ⊗κ[t−1,t] κ[t−1, t]]) = rank(H N

r ( ˜X)).

The von-Neumann completion:
When κ = C, the ring of Laurent polynomials C[t−1, t], equivalently the group ring C[Z] of the inﬁnite

cyclic group Z, is an algebra with involution ∗ and trace tr.

If a =Pn∈Z antn then:

ant−n

∗(a) := a∗ =Xn∈Z

tr(a) =a0.

with a denoting the complex conjugate of the complex number a.

The algebra C[Z] can be considered as a sub algebra of the algebra of bounded linear operators on the

separable Hilbert space

l2(Z) = {an, n ∈ Z |Xn∈Z

|an|2 < ∞}.

The linear operator deﬁned by a Laurent polynomial is given by the multiplication of the Laurent poly-
nomial (regarded as a sequence with all but ﬁnitely many components equal to zero) with a sequences in
l2(Z).

One denotes by N the weak closure of C[Z]8 which is a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra, with involution

and trace extending the ones deﬁned above, cf [10].

This algebra N is referred below as the von–Neumann completion of the group ring C(Z) and is iso-
morphic to the familiar L∞(S1) via Fourier series transform (which assigns to a complex valued function
deﬁned on S1 its Fourier series).

Given a free C[t−1, t]–module M a C[t−1, t]-valued inner product in M is a map µ : M ×M → C[t−1, t]

which satisﬁes:

1. C[t−1, t]−linear in the ﬁrst variable,

2. symmetric in the sense that µ(x, y) = µ(y, x)∗, x, y ∈ M,

3. positive deﬁnite in the sense that satisﬁes

(a) µ(x, x) ∈ C[t−1, t]+ with C[t−1, t]+ the set of elements of the form aa∗ and
(b) µ(x, x) = 0 iff x = 0,

and

4. the map M → Hom

C[t−1,t](M, C[t−1, t]) deﬁned by µ(y)(x) = µ(x, y) is one to one.

Clearly C[t−1, t]-valued inner products exist. Indeed, if e1, e2, · · · ek is a base of M then

provides such inner product.

µ(X aiei,X bjej) :=X ai(bi)∗

By completing the C−vector space M w.r. to the Hermitian inner product < x, y >:= tr(µ(x, y)) one
obtains a Hilbert space M which is an N -Hilbert module, cf [10], isomeric to l2(Z)⊕k, k the rank of M. Two
different C[t−1, t]-valued inner products, µ1 and µ2, lead to the isomorphic (and then also isometric) Hilbert
modules M µ1 and M µ2. This justiﬁes dropping µ from notation. If one identiﬁes N to L∞(S1) and l2(Z)⊕k

to L2(S1)⊕k (by interpreting the sequence Pn∈Z antn as the complex valued function Pn∈Z aneinθ) the

N − module structure on l2(Z)⊕k becomes the L∞(S1)-module structure on (L2(S1)⊕k and is given by the

8 in the space of bounded operators of the Hilbert space l2(Z) when each element of C[Z] is regarded as such operator

8

component-wise multiplication of the L∞-function in L∞(S1) with the k−tuple of L2-functions, an element
in (L2(S1)⊕k.

If one has N ⊂ M a free split submodule of the f.g free C[t−1, t]-module M and µ is an C[t−1, t]-
valued inner product on M, then N µ is a closed Hilbert submodule of M µ. Moreover if N ′
i ⊆ Ni ⊆ M,
is a collection of split submodules and Ni/N ′
i is a collection of free modules, quotient of
i = 1, 2, · · ·
submodules of M, then one can canonically convert Ni/N ′
i into closed Hilbert submodules of M simply
by taking the closure of the kernel of the projection Ni → Ni/N ′
i inside M . The process of passing from
(C[t−1, t], M) to (N , M ) is referred to as von Neumann completion and was pioneered in [11] for any group
ring C[Γ] and f.g. projective C[Γ]-module.

3.1 Recollections from Part 1, ([2])

In this subsection we recall a number of observations already made in [2] but we reconsider them in the
context of proper maps deﬁned on locally compact ANR’s in order to be applied to the lifts of an angle
valued maps in the next subsection.

Consider h : Y → R with Y a locally compact ANR Y and h a proper map. Suppose that ǫ(h) > 0.

Recall that ǫ(h) is the shortest distance between homological critical values. Recall that for a, b ∈ R

Fh
r (a, b) = Ih

a(r) ∩ Ib

h(r) ⊆ Hr(Y ).

Proposition 3.1

1. Fh

r (a, b) is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space with the property that:

(a) Fh
(b) Fh

r (a′, b′) ⊆ Fh
r (a′, b′) = Fh

r (a, b) for a′ ≤ a, b ≤ b′,
r (a′, b) ∩ Fh

r (a, b′).

As in part I, for ǫ > 0 one denotes by B(a, b; ǫ) := (a − ǫ, a] × [b, b + ǫ). In view of Proposition (3.1)

item 1. the inclusion B(a, b; ǫ) ⊆ B(a, b; ǫ′) for ǫ′ > ǫ induces the surjective linear map Fh

by

Note that δh

r and ˆδh

r are not conﬁgurations since their support, although discrete, is not ﬁnite. Neverthe-

less, as noticed in part I the assignments R2 ∋ (a, b)   ˆδh

r (a, b) has the following properties:

Proposition 3.2

1. If ˆδh

r (a, b) 6= 0 then both a, b are homological critical values, hence

supp ˆδh

r = supp δh

r ⊂ CR(h) × CR(h).

2. If a, b are both homological critical values and ǫ < ǫ(f ) then ˆδh

r (a, b) = Fh

r (B(a, b; ǫ)).

Proof: Items 1. and 2. follow from Observation 3.9 [2] and item 3. from Observation 3.11 in [2].

which is a right inverse of πr(a, b), i.e. πr(a, b)·ir(a, b) = id. We keep the same notation for the composition
of ir(a, b) with the inclusion Fh

r (a, b) ⊆ Hr(Y ).

If (a, b) ∈ B′, i.e. B′ has to be of the form B′ = (a′′, a′] × [b′, b′′) with a′′ ≤ a ≤ a′, b′ ≤ b ≤ b′′,

denote by

resp. ⊕(a,b)∈supp δh

r ∩B .

Choose a collection of splittings S = {ir(a, b) | (a, b) ∈ supp δh

r }, and consider the sum

SIr = M(a,b)

Manipulation with this diagram as in [2] (decomposition of B as a disjoint union of smaller boxes) permits
to establish inductively the result.

Item 2. follows from Item 1. by passing to projective limit as follows.
For R > 0 denote by B(a, b; R) the box B(a, b; R) = (−R + a, a] × [b, b + R), and observe that
r ∩ B(a, b; R) remains constant when
r (B(a, b; R)) is a quotient of the

B(a, b; ∞) := (−∞, a] × [b, ∞) = ∪R>0(B(a, b; R) and that supp δh
R is large enough. This because of Proposition 3.2 item 3. and because Fh

We apply the previous considerations to ˜f : ˜X → R an inﬁnite cyclic cover of f : X → S1. In this case
we have the deck transformation τ : ˜X → ˜X which induces the isomorphism tr : Hr( ˜X) → Hr( ˜X) and
therefore a structure of κ[t−1, t]−module this κ−vector space. The diagram (4) with the vertical arrows
induced by tr implies Observation 3.4.

αn−1tn−1 · · · α1t + α0, αi ∈ κ, α0 6= 0 such that P (t) tkx = 0. Let y = tkx. Since Hr( ˜X) = ∪bIb
(r) one
˜f
has y ∈ Ib(r) for some b ∈ R. Since P (t)y = 0 one concludes that
y = −(αn/α0)tn−1 · · ·−(α1/α0)ty and therefore y ∈ Ib+2π(r). Repeating the argument one concludes that
y ∈ I b+2πk for any k, hence y ∈ I∞(r). Since x = t−ky, one has x ∈ I∞.(r) Hence T (Hr( ˜X)) ⊆ I ∞(r).

Let x ∈ I∞(r). Since Hr( ˜X) = ∪aI
a(r) then x ∈ Ia(r) for some a ∈ R, and if in addition x ∈ I∞(r)
then by Observation 3.4 3. all x, t−1x, t−2x, · · · t−kx, · · · ∈ Ia(r) ∩ I∞(r). Since by Proposition 3.1 (1.) the
dimension of Ia(r) ∩ I∞(r) is ﬁnite, there exists αi1, · · · αik such that (αi1t−i1 + · · · αik t−ik )x = 0. This
makes x ∈ T (Hr( ˜X). Hence I∞(r) ⊆ T (Hr( ˜X)). Therefore I∞(r) = T (Hr( ˜X)). By a similar argument
one concludes that Hr( ˜X) = I−∞(r).

Recall from Introduction that hi : R2 → T = R2/Z denotes the map which assigns to (a, b) ∈ R2 its

equivalence class ha, bi ∈ T. We use the following notations:

– For (a, b) ∈ R2 denote by Tha, bi the image by hi of the set {(x, y) ∈ R2 | x ≤ a, y ≥ b}; clearly for

a′ ≤ a, b′ ≥ b one has Tha′, b′i ⊆ Tha, bi.

– For a box B = (a − α, a] × [b, b + β) denote by (B + c) the box (B + c) := (a − α + c, a + c] ×

[b + c, b + c + β), and by hBi ⊆ T the image of B by the map hi.

– One calls the box B small if 0 < α, β < 2π, in which case the restriction of hi to B is one to one;

clearly if B is a small box so is any (B + c) and (B + 2πk) ∩ (B + 2π(k + 1)) = ∅ for k 6= k′.

– For ha, bi ∈ T and hBi ⊆ T with B a small box introduce:

Proof of Theorem 1.1 and 1.2

Theorem 1.1:

Item 1. is veriﬁed by Proposition 3.2 (1.).
Item 2.

follows from the fact that π(r) · (S Ir) is an isomorphism as established in Theorem 3.3
r (habi) =

r is actually a special conﬁguration as described in section 2 with ˆδf

above. The conﬁguration ˆδf

r (hB(a, b; ǫ)i) for any ǫ < ǫ(f ).

For Item 3. one proceeds as in the proof of Theorem 4.1 item 4.

in [2]. For example in case X is
a smooth manifold, possibly with boundary, any angle valued map is arbitrary closed to a Morse angle
valued map f which takes different values on different critical points. Then the same remains true for
˜f : ˜X → R, an inﬁnite ciclic cover of this Morse map; this guarantees that for the sequence of critical
values · · · ci−1 < ci < ci+1 < · · · , the inclusion induced linear maps H∗( ˜Xci−1) → H∗( ˜Xci) have co-
˜f
kernel of dimension at most one. As argued in [2], in the proof of Theorem 1 (4.), this implies that δ
r
and then δf
r takes as values only 0 or 1. In the same way as in [2], with the help of compact Hilbert cube
manifolds, one derives Item 3. in the generality stated.

Theorem 1.2.
Proof: In view of Observations 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 the proof of item 1. is the same as of Theorem 4.2 in [2]
provided we replace f : X → R, by ˜f : ˜X → R a lift of f : X → S1 representing ξ. The basic ingredients,
Proposition 3.16, (based on Lemma 3.17 and Lemma 3.18) in [2] holds for h : Y → R, Y a locally compact
ANR and h a proper map, instead of f : X → R, X compact. The steps of the proof are similar to the one
described in subsection 4.2 in [2] and are summarized below.

1. For a pair (X, ξ), X compact ANR let ˜X be an inﬁnite cyclic cover associated to ξ and let Cξ(X, S1),
denote the set of maps in the homotopy class deﬁned by ξ equipped with the compact open topology.
Observe that:
– the compact open topology is induced from the complete metric D(f, g) and D(f, g) = D( ˜f , ˜g)
for appropriate liftings.
– for f, g ∈ Cξ(X, S1) with D(f, g) < π and any sequence 0 = t0 < t1 · · · tN −1 < tN = 1 by
Observation 2.1 item 3. the canonical homotopy ht from f to g satisﬁes

D(f, g) = X0≤i<N

D(hti+1 , hti ).

16

(12)

2. For X is a simplicial complex let U ⊂ Cξ(X, S1) be the subset of p.l. maps. One can verify that:

– U is a dense subset in Cξ(X, S1),
– if f, g ∈ U , D(f, g) < π then for the canonical homotopy each ht ∈ U , hence ǫ(ht) > 0, hence
for any t ∈ [0, 1] there exists δ(t) > 0 s.t. t′, t′′ ∈ (t − δ(t), t + δ(t)) implies D(ht′, ht) < ǫ(ht)/3.
Both statements 2. and 3. are argued as in [2].

3. Consider the space of conﬁgurations Cbr (T) viewed as the br = βN

r (X; ξ)− symmetric product of
T equipped with the induced metric, D, which is complete. Since any map in U is tame, in view
Proposition (3.16) in [2], f, g ∈ U with D(f, g) < ǫ(f )/3 imply

D(δf

r , δg

r ) ≤ 2D(f, g).

(13)

This sufﬁces to conclude the continuity of the assignment f   δf
r .

To ﬁnalize the proof of Theorem (1.2) item 1. we check ﬁrst (step 1.) that the inequality (13) extends to
all f, g ∈ U , second (step 2.) that the inequality (13) extends to all f, g ∈ Cξ(X, S1) for X a ﬁnite simplicial
complex, third (step 3.) that the inequality (13) extends to all f, g ∈ Cξ(X, S1) for X an arbitrary compact
ANR.

• Step 1.: In view of the continuity of the assignment f   δf

r it sufﬁces to verify step 1. for f, g ∈ U
s.t. D(f, g) < π since D(f, g) ≤ π. Start with f, g ∈ U and consider the canonical homotopy
˜ht = t ˜f + (1 − t)˜g, t ∈ [0, 1] between two lifts lifts ˜f , ˜g of f and g which satisfy D(f, g) = D( ˜f , ˜g).
Note that each ˜ht satisﬁes ˜ht(µ(n, x)) = ˜ht(x) + 2πn, hence is a lift, and each ht is p.l.
Choose a sequence 0 < t1 < t3 < t5, · · · t2N −1 < 1 such that for i = 1, · · · , (2N − 1) the
intervals (t2i−1 − δ(t2i−1), t2i−1 + δ(t2i−1)) cover [0, 1] and (t2i−1, t2i−1 + δ(t2i−1)) ∩ (t2i+1 −
δ(t2i+1), t2i+1) 6= ∅. This is possible in view of the compacity of [0, 1].
Take t0 = 0, t2N = 1 and t2i ∈ (t2i−1, t2i−1 + δ(t2i−1)) ∩ (t2i+1 − δ(t2i+1). To simplify the notation
abbreviate hti to hi. In view of 2. and 3. above (inequality (22)) one has:
|t2i−1 − t2i| < δ(t2i−1) implies D(δh2i−1 , δh2i ) < 2D(h2i−1, h2i) and
|t2i − t2i+1| < δ(t2i+1) implies D(δh2i , δh2i+1 ) < 2D(h2i, h2i+1)
Then we have

D(δf , δg) ≤ X0≤i<2N −1

D(δhi, δhi+1) ≤ 2 X0≤i<2N −1

D(hi, hi+1) = D(f, g).

• Step 2.: Suppose X is a simplicial complex. In view of the density of U and of the completeness of
the metrics on Cξ(X; S1) and Cbr (T), the inequality (13) extends to the entire Cξ(X; S1) in case X is
a simplicial complex. Indeed the assignment U ∋ f   δf
r ∈ Cbr (R2) preserve the Cauchy sequences.

• Step 3.: We verify the inequality (13) for X = K × Q, K simplicial complex and Q the Hilbert cube.
One proceed exactly as in [2]. Since by Theorem 2.3 item 2 in [2] any compact Hilbert cube manifold
is homeomorphic to K × Q for some ﬁnite simplicial complex K, the inequality (13) continues to
hold for X any compact Hilbert cube manifold. Since for any X a compact ANR, by Theorem 2.3
item 1 in [2], X × Q is a Hilbert cube manifold, I : C(X; R) → C(X × Q; R) deﬁned by I(f ) = f Q
is an isometric embedding and δf = δf Q, hence the inequality (13) holds for any X a compact ANR.

17

For item 2, suppose that we are in the situation to realize ˆδf

r as a conﬁguration of free submodules of
H N (X, ξ), as it is the case in the presence of a collection of compatible splittings or, in the case κ = C,
after the von Newman completion into the L∞(S1)−Hilbert module H L1( ˜X). Note that Lemma 3.18 and
Lemma 3.17 in [2] imply that for a given f and (a, b) ∈ CR(f ) × CR(f ) and ǫ < ǫ(f ) and any g with
||g − f ||∞ < ǫ/3, inside H N

r (X; ξ), the following two spaces are exactly the same.

The ﬁrst is

X

(a′,b′)∈D(a,b;ǫ)∩suppδ˜g

(ˆir(ha′, b′i)(ˆδg(ha′, b′i)

with D(a, b; ǫ) := (a − ǫ, a + ǫ] × [b − ǫ, b + ǫ), the second is

ˆir(ha, bi)(ˆδf (ha, bi).

This is explained in [2] in the ﬁrst three lines after the proof of Lemma 3.18. This insures the continuity in
the ﬁne collision topology and therefore in the natural collision topology.

5

Proof of Theorem 1.3

In view of Theorem 1.2 it sufﬁces to establish the result for tame maps. We will suppose that both a, b are
regular values in strong sense. In case X is a compact manifold a number c is such regular value if f −1(c)
is a codimension one sub manifold and for a small neighborhood U ∋ c, the map f −1(U ) → U is a locally
trivial bundle.

˜f

To establish ˆδ
r (ha, bi) ≃ homκ[t−1,t](ˆδ
n−r(hb, ai), κ[t−1, t]) for ˜f : ˜M → R the inﬁnite cyclic cover of
f : M → S1 we apply the same strategy as in section 6 of [2]. Note that if items 1.and 2. are established for
such regular values a, b, in view of Theorem 1.2, they will hold for any any a, b and any continuous map.

ker(ia(n − r))∗ ∩ ker(ib(n − r))∗ = (coker(ib(n − r) ⊕ ia(n − r))∗ = (G

holds by exactness of the ﬁrst rows in the diagrams, the second by the equality of the top and bottom right

The key observation for ﬁnalizing items 1. and 2. is the following proposition.

Proposition 5.2 The κ− linear maps F

˜f
r (a, b) →BM F

˜f
r (a, b)

1. are compatible with the deck transformation,

2. are surjective,

3. have the kernel independent on (a, b), equal to the kernel of the κ[t−1, t]−linear map Hr( ˜M ) →

H BM

r

( ˜M ) which is equal to T (Hr( ˜M ).

Precisely one shows that one has a natural short exact sequence

0 → Cr(M ) → F

˜f
r (a, b) →BM F

˜f
r (a, b) → 0

which is compatible with the action provided by the deck transformations and leaving Cr(M ) invariant,
and Cr(M ) is exactly the κ[t−1, t]−torsion of the Hr( ˜M ). Precisely one has the following commutative
diagram.

Hn−r( ˜M ) is a f.g., hence Hn−r( ˜M ) = H N

The last isomorphism ”≃” is true because both are free modules of rank βN

Item 3. What follows is only an informal presentation of the arguments for Item 3. A detailed presenta-

tion will be provided in [5].

In case κ = C and M is a Riemannian manifold, hence ˜M is also equipped with a Riemannian metric,

the Poincar´e Duality linear isomorphism

P D = lim←−

0<l,t→∞

Hr(( ˜M , M−l ⊔ M t) → (Hn−r(M (−l, t))∗

should be regarded in the category of vector spaces with scalar product. Each of these vector spaces are ﬁnite
dimensional and equipped with a scalar product induced by the Riemannian metric (via the identiﬁcation of
r (M ; ξ) with L2−harmonic forms in degree (n − r) on ˜M). The appropriate inverse limit in this setting

leads to

r ( ˜M ) → (H L2

where ”∗” here means the Hilbert space dual. The C[t−1, t]−linearity of the map P Dr becoming in this
setting the morphism P DL2 of L∞(S1)−Hilbert modules. Clearly in this settings the diagram (22) becomes
a diagram of ﬁnite type Hilbert modules and the linear surjections receiving a canonical splitting provided by
the orthogonality inside Hilbert modules. These lead to a canonical realization ˆˆδf

6 Some consequences

Observation 6.1

1. A pleasant consequence of Theorem (1.3) is that (c, c′) ∈ suppδf

r iff (c′c) ∈ suppδf

n−r and both pairs

appear with equal multiplicity δf

r (c, c′) = δf

n−r(c′, c).

2. Theorem 1.3 remains valid by the same proof in case M is a compact manifold with boundary

r (∂M ; ξf∂M ) 10vanishes for all r. In particular, under the above hypothesis ,

(M, ∂M ), provided H N
H N

r (M ; ξf ) ≃ H N

n−r(M ; ξf ).

Corollary 6.2 Suppose (M 2n, ∂M 2n) is a compact manifold with boundary which has the homotopy type
of a simplicial complex of dimension ≤ n and ξ ∈ H 1(M ; Z) s.t H N

r (∂M ; ξ∂M ) = 0 for all r. Then:

1. βN

r (X : ξ) = (0 if r 6= n

−1nχ(Mn) if r 6= n

cients in κ.

2. βr(X) = (αr−1 + αr if r 6= n

αn−1 + αn + −1nχ(Mn)
cf [3] or [4]) with eigenvalue is equal to one.

, where αr denotes the number of Jordan cells Jr(M, ξf ),

3.

If V 2n−1 ⊂ M 2n is compact proper sub manifold with Poincar´e dual ξf (i,e, V ⋔ ∂M, 11 and

V ∩ ∂M = ∂V ) and Hr(V ) = 0 the set of Jordan cells Jr(M, ξ) is empty.

Item 1. follows from Observation (6.1) and the fact that both Betti numbers and Novikov–Betti numbers
calculate the same Euler–Poincar´e characteristic. Item 2 follows from Theorem 11 item c. in [4], and Item
3. from the description of Jordan cells in terms of linear relations as provided in [1] .

As pointed out to us by L Maxim, the complement X = Cn \ V of a complex hyper surface V ⊂
Cn, V := {(z1, z2, · · · zn) | f (z1, z2, · · · zn) = 0} regular at inﬁnity, equipped with the canonical class
ξf ∈ H 1(X : Z) deﬁned by f : X → C \ 0 is an example of an open manifold with an integral cohomology
class which has as compactiﬁcation a manifold with boundary with a cohomology class which satisﬁes the
hypotheses above.

Item 1. recovers a calculation of L Maxim, cf [13] and [14] 12 that the complement of an algebraic hyper

surface regular at inﬁnity has vanishing Novikov homologies in all dimension but n.

7 Appendix (on Borel Moore homology)

Recall that ˜M (a, b) and ˜M (c) denote the compact set ˜f −1([a, b]) and ˜f −1(a) which for a, b, c regular
values are sub manifolds (with boundary in the ﬁrst case). We also denote by ˜Ma = ˜f −1((−∞, a]) and
˜M b = ˜f −1([b, ∞)).

Note that the Poincar´e Duality for bordisms provides the isomorphisms

P D(−l, a) : Hr( ˜M (−l, a), ˜M (−l)) → H n−r( ˜M (−l, a), ˜M (a)), −l < a

P D(b, t) : Hr( ˜M (b, t), ˜M (t)) → H n−r( ˜M (b, b + t), ˜M (b)), t > b

(25)

P D(−l, t) : Hr( ˜M (−l, t), ˜M (−l) ⊔ ˜M (t)) → H n−r( ˜M (−l, +t)), t, l > 0.

Combining with excision property in homology or cohomology and passing to limit when 0 < l → ∞,

(or 0 < l, t → ∞) one derives the Poincar´e Duality isomorphisms

12The Friedl-Maxim results state the vanishing of more general and more sophisticated L2−homologies and Novikov type

homologies. They can be also recovered via the appropriate Poincar´e Duality isomorphisms
