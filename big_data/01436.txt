Abstract— This paper considers the problem of constructing
a direct coupling quantum observer for a quantum harmonic
oscillator system. The proposed observer is shown to be able to
estimate one but not both of the plant variables and produces
a measureable output using homodyne detection.

I. INTRODUCTION

A number of papers have recently considered the problem
of constructing a coherent quantum observer for a quantum
system; e.g., see [1]–[4]. In the coherent quantum observer
problem, a quantum plant is coupled to a quantum observer
which is also a quantum system. The quantum observer is
constructed to be a physically realizable quantum system
so that the system variables of the quantum observer con-
verge in some suitable sense to the system variables of the
quantum plant. The papers [4]–[7] considered the problem
of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a
given closed quantum system. In [4], the proposed observer
is shown to be able to estimate some but not all of the
plant variables in a time averaged sense. Also, the paper
[8] shows that a possible experimental implementation of
the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system
considered in [4] may be constructed using a non-degenerate
parametric ampliﬁer (NDPA) which is coupled to a beam-
splitter by suitable choice of the NDPA and beamsplitter
parameters.

One important limitation of the direct coupled quantum
observer results given in [4]–[8] is that both the quantum
plant and the quantum observer are closed quantum systems.
This means that it not possible to make an experimental mea-
surement to verify the properties of the quantum observer.
In this paper, we address this difﬁculty by extending the
results of [4] to allow for the case in which the quantum
observer is an open quantum linear system whose output
can be monitored using homodyne detection. In this case, it
is shown that similar results can be obtained as in [4] except
that now the observer output is subject to a white noise
perturbation. However, by suitably designing the observer,
it is shown that the level of this noise perturbation can
be made arbitrarily small (at the expense of slow observer

convergence). Also, the results of [8] are extended to show
that a possible experimental implementation of the aug-
mented quantum plant and quantum observer system may
be constructed using a non-degenerate parametric ampliﬁer
(NDPA) which is coupled to a beamsplitter by suitable choice
of the NDPA and beamsplitter parameters. In this case, the
NDPA contains an extra ﬁeld channel as compared to the
result in [8] and this extra channel is used for homodyne
detection in the observer.

II. DIRECT COUPLING COHERENT QUANTUM OBSERVER

WITH OBSERVER MEASUREMENT

In this section, we extend the theory of [4] to the case of a
direct coupled quantum observer which is also coupled to a
ﬁeld to enable measurements to be made on the observer. In
our proposed direct coupled coherent quantum observer, the
quantum plant is a single quantum harmonic oscillator which
is a linear quantum system (e.g., see [9]–[13]) described by
the non-commutative differential equation

˙xp(t) = 0;
zp(t) = Cpxp(t)

xp(0) = x0p;

(1)

where zp(t) denotes the system variable to be estimated by
the observer and Cp ∈ R1×2. This quantum plant corre-
pp (cid:21)
sponds to a plant Hamiltonian Hp = 0. Here xp = (cid:20) qp

where qp is the plant position operator and pp is the plant
momentum operator. It follows from (1) that the plant system
variables xp(t) will remain ﬁxed if the plant is not coupled
to the observer.

We now describe the linear quantum system which will
correspond to the quantum observer; see also [9]–[13]. This
system is described by a quantum stochastic differential
equation (QSDE) of the form

dxo = Aoxodt + Bodw;
dyo = Coxodt + dw;

xo(0) = x0o;

zo(t) = Kyo

(2)

where dw = (cid:20) dQ

dP (cid:21) is a 2 × 1 vector of quantum noises

expressed in quadrature form corresponding to the input ﬁeld
for the observer and dyo is the corresponding output ﬁeld;
e.g., see [9], [11]. The observer output zo(t) will be a real
scalar quantity obtained by applying homodyne detection
to the observer output ﬁeld. Ao ∈ R2×2, Bo ∈ R2×2,
po (cid:21) is a vector of self-adjoint
Co ∈ R2×2. Also, xo(t) =(cid:20) qo

system variables corresponding to the observer position and

momentum operators; e.g., see [9]. We assume that
the
plant variables commute with the observer variables. The
system dynamics (2) are determined by the observer system
Hamiltonian and coupling operators which are operators
on the underlying Hilbert space for the observer. For the
quantum observer under consideration, this Hamiltonian is
a self-adjoint operator given by the quadratic form: Ho =
2 xo(0)T Roxo(0), where Ro is a real symmetric matrix.
Also, the coupling operator L is deﬁned by a matrix Wo ∈
R2×2 so that

Then, we can write the QSDEs describing the closed loop

e.g., see [9], [11]. Now it follow from (1) and (8) that

zp = αT xp.

Hence, it follows from the ﬁrst equation in (9) that

dzp = 2αT J αβT xodt = 0.

That is, the quantity zp remains constant even after the quan-
tum plant is coupled to the quantum observer. In addition,
we can re-write the remaining equations in (9) as

dxo = (cid:20) − κ

It is straightforward to verify that this transfer function is

the matrix

2 (cid:21) is Hurwitz and hence, the system (12)

will converge to a steady state in which dwout represents
a standard quantum white noise with zero mean and unit
intensity. Hence, at steady state, the equation

dyo = −2√κ(cid:20) − κ

2ωo
−2ωo − κ

2

2 (cid:21)−1

J βzpdt + dwout

(13)

shows that the output ﬁeld converges to a constant value plus
zero mean white quantum noise with unit intensity.

We now consider the construction of the vector K deﬁning
the observer output zo. This vector determines the quadrature
of the output ﬁeld which is measured by the homodyne
detector. We ﬁrst re-write equation (13) as

dyo = ezpdt + dwout

where

Hence, as κ → 0, kek → ∞ and therefore kKk → 0. This
means that we can make the noise level on our measurement
arbitrarily small by choosing κ > 0 sufﬁciently small.
However, as κ gets smaller, the system (12) gets closer to
instability and hence, takes longer to converge to steady state.

III. A POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANT

OBSERVER SYSTEM

In this section, we describe one possible experimental
implementation of the plant-observer system given in the pre-
vious section. The plant-observer system is a linear quantum
system with Hamiltonian

In order to construct a linear quantum system with a
Hamiltonian of this form, we consider an NDPA coupled
to a beamsplitter as shown schematically in Figure 2; e.g.,
see [14].

dzo = Kezpdt + Kdwout.

Hence, we choose K such that

and therefore

where

dzo = zpdt + dn

dn = Kdwout

will be a white noise process at steady state with intensity
kKk2. Thus, to maximize the signal to noise ratio for our
measurement, we wish to choose K to minimize kKk2
subject to the constraint (15). Note that it follows from (15)

ﬁrst mode of the NDPA and b is the annihilation operator
corresponding to the second mode of the NDPA. These
modes will be assumed to be of the same frequency but with
a different polarization with a corresponding to the quantum
plant and b corresponding to the quantum observer. Also, ǫ
is a complex parameter deﬁning the level of squeezing in the
NDPA and ωo corresponds to the detuning frequency of the b
mode in the NDPA. The a mode in the NDPA is assumed to
be tuned. In addition, the NDPA corresponds to a vector of

In practice,
this ratio would be chosen in the range of
|ǫ|√κ1κ2 ∈ (0, 0.6) in order to ensure that the linearized model
which is being used is valid.
We now construct the vectors α and β so that condition

(19) is satisﬁed. Indeed, we let

α =" 1

−ℑ(ǫ)−ℑ(δ) # , β =(cid:20) −ℑ(ǫ) − ℑ(δ)
ℜ(ǫ) + ℜ(δ)

ℜ(ǫ)−ℜ(δ)

(cid:21) .

For these values of α and β, it is straightforward to verify
that (19) is satisﬁed provided that |ǫ| = |δ|. With this value
of β, we now calculate the quantity e deﬁned in (14) as
follows:

e =

o (cid:20) κ3

(cid:21) J β
(cid:21)(cid:20) ℜ(ǫ) + ℜ(δ)
ℑ(ǫ) + ℑ(δ) (cid:21) .

= −

κ2
3 + 16ω2

Then, the vector K deﬁning the quadrature measured by the
homodyne detector is constructed according to the equation
(16).

In the special case that ωo = 0, this reduces to

In terms of complex numbers e = e(1) + ıe(2), we can write
this as

e = −

4

κ3 (cid:20) ℜ(ǫ) + ℜ(δ)
ℑ(ǫ) + ℑ(δ) (cid:21) .

e = −

(ǫ + δ).

Then, in terms of complex numbers K = K(1) + ıK(2), the
formula (16) becomes

K =

e

|e|2 = −

κ3(ǫ + δ)

4(ǫ + δ)(¯ǫ + ¯δ)

= −

κ3

4(¯ǫ + ¯δ)

where ¯(·) denotes complex conjugate. Also, as noted in
Section II, the steady state measurement noise intensity is
given by

which approaches zero as κ3 → 0. However, this is at the
expense of increasingly slower convergence to steady state.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have shown that a direct coupling
observer for a linear quantum system can be implemented
in the case that
the observer can be measured using a
Homodyne detection measurement. This would allow the
plant observer system to be constructed experimentally and
the performance of the observer could be veriﬁed using the
measured data.
