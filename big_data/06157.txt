Abstract

The deformed Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model is a quantum integrable system
with arbitrary numbers of two types of particles and reducing to the standard CS
model in special cases. We show that a known collective ﬁeld description of the
CS model, which is based on conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT), is actually a collective
ﬁeld description of the deformed CS model. This provides a natural application of
the deformed CS model in Wen’s eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the fractional quantum
Hall eﬀect (FQHE), with the two kinds of particles corresponding to electrons and
quasi-hole excitations. In particular, using known mathematical results about super
Jack polynomials, we obtain simple explicit formulas for the orthonormal CFT basis
proposed by van Elburg and Schoutens in the context of the FQHE.

Introduction

The quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model [1, 2] has become a paradigm for an exactly
solvable system which not only has fascinating mathematical properties but also interesting
physics applications. As discovered by Chalykh, Feigin, Veselov [3] and Sergeev [4], this
model allows for a generalization that is most natural from a mathematics point of view.
This deformed CS model is quantum integrable [5], and it is related to Lie superalgebras [6]
similarly as the standard CS model is related to Lie algebras [7]. It was found that the super
Jack polynomials, which were proposed as a natural mathematical generalization of the Jack
polynomials [8], provide eigenfunctions of the deformed CS model in a natural generalization
of a well-known result for the standard CS model [4, 9]. Moreover, intriguing relations
between eigenfunctions of the CS model have been found by extending the mathematical
theory of Jack polynomials [10, 11] to the super case [9, 12]. However, diﬀerent from the
standard CS model, no satisfactory interpretation of the deformed CS model as quantum
many-body system is known. In this paper we present a generalization of a known collective

ﬁeld representation of the standard CS model [13, 14, 15, 16] to the deformed case. As will
be discussed, this provides a physics application of the deformed CS model to the fractional
quantum Hall eﬀect (FQHE) [17]. We also mention applications to the theory of special
functions.

We consider vertex operators φν(x) =

× in a standard conformal ﬁeld
theory (CFT) of chiral bosons ϕ(x) such that J(x) ≡ ∂xϕ(x) satisﬁes the aﬃne Kac-Moody
algebra relations [J(x), J(y)] = −2πi∂xδ(x − y), with x, y variables on the circle [−π, π)
and ν a non-zero parameter such that ν2 is rational (see e.g. [18]; precise mathematical
deﬁnitions can be found also in the main text). This CFT allows for a collective ﬁeld
description [19] of the CS model. This provides a self-adjoint CFT operator Hν,3 that has
the following relations with a product of an arbitrary number N of such vertex operators,

with

This identity has many interesting implications explored in the physics and mathematics
literature; see e.g. [20, 21, 22, 23]. We obtain a generalization of this to a product of
arbitrary numbers N ,M of two types of vertex operators φν(x) and φ−1/ν(x) as follows,

the diﬀerential operator deﬁning the deformed CS model [4]; see Proposition 3.1 for a precise
formulation. It is important to note that the CFT operator Hν,3 appearing in (1.1) and
(1.3) is the same. Thus our results can be summarized as follows: The known collective
ﬁeld theory description of the CS model is, in fact, a collective ﬁeld theory description of
the deformed CS model.

One application is in the context of Wen’s theory of the FQHE [24], which is based on
the very same CFT model that underlies our construction.
In Wen’s theory, the vertex
operators φν(x) and φ−1/ν(x) play a fundamental role since they describe quasi-particle
excitations [25]. However, since these quasi-particles are strongly interacting, the anyon
states1 obtained by acting with the Fourier modes of these vertex operators on the vac-
uum |0(cid:105) are not orthogonal, and this is a serious complication in practical computations.
As proposed in [25], it is possible to use the relation of this theory to the CS model to

1We use this names since, in general, the vertex operators φν(x) and φ−1/ν(x) obey the exchange

relations of anyons; see (3.7).

orthogonalize the anyon states. We use the result in (1.3) to construct an explicit map
from super Jack polynomials to such orthogonalized anyon states; see Proposition 4.1. As
we discuss, results in the literature [23, 25, 26] suggest that the CFT states thus obtained
are a complete orthogonal basis of common eigenstates of an inﬁnite set of operators Hν,k,
k = 1, 2, . . ., which should exist in this theory by general symmetry considerations [27]. We
prove the common eigenstate property for k = 1, 2, 3, with Hν,1, Hν,2 and Hν,3 correspond-
ing to the charge operator, the CFT Hamiltonian, and the dCS collective ﬁeld Hamiltonian,
respectively. Moreover, for technical reasons, we are only able to prove this result for integer
g > 0. We therefore also include an appendix where we present a complimentary construc-
tion of these eigenstates. This other construction, which generalizes previous constructions
in [16] and [25], is less elegant but works for all rational g > 0.

We also mention applications of our result in (1.3) in the theory of super Jack polyno-
mials. We construct a map from eigenstates of the operators Hν,3 to eigenfunctions of the
deformed CS model; see Corollary 5.1. Using this map and our construction of eigenstates
of Hν,3 described above, we obtain an explicit integral transform between eigenfunctions
of the deformed CS model for diﬀerent variable numbers (N, M ) and (N(cid:48), M(cid:48)); see (5.32)–
(5.33). This gives a quantum ﬁeld theory interpretation of result previously obtained by
other methods in [12]. We also provide arguments that this map opens a way to generalize
results in [9], but we leave a further investigation of this to future work.

The relation between the CS model and the FQHE is known since a long time [28] and
has been explored in many papers; see e.g. [23, 29] for recent work. Our result suggest
that the CS model is only part of this story, and the deformed CS model is a natural
generalization which can give a deeper understanding. It thus is natural to expect that
other known results about the FQHE based on the standard CS model have interesting
generalizations to the deformed case.

It is interesting to note that the result in (1.3) was already anticipated in the physics
literature on the FQHE: We mentioned already work of van Elburg and Schoutens [25]
suggesting that the operator Hν,3 can be used to orthogonalize the anyon states. More
speciﬁcally, they pointed out that the vertex operators φν(x) can only account for electron
excitations, and to get a complete basis in the CFT Hilbert space one needs to include also
the quasi-hole operators φ−1/ν(x). As an example they constructed an eigenstate of Hν,3
which contains one fermion and one quasi-hole and which, in our notation, corresponds to
the case N = M = 1. We also mention that mathematical details in the computations in
[30] could have been taken as a hint at the existence of super Jack polynomials,2 and that
the parent Hamiltonian for particles and quasi-particles of the CS model proposed in [31]
is identical with the rational limit of the deformed CS model.

The plan of this paper is as follows. The next section collects some deﬁnitions and
know results about the deformed CS model. A precise formulation of our main result and
its proof can be found in Section 3. Our applications to the FQHE and special function
theory are given in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 contains our conclusions. We
also include two appendices. In Appendix A we collect computational details and technical
proofs. The alternative construction of eigenstates of dCS collective ﬁeld Hamiltonian Hν,3

mentioned above can be found in Appendix B.

A technical remark is in order: the framework we use is based on CFT results which are
well-known in the physics literature. The present paper generalizes results in [16] where
an analytic approach to making these CFT results precise is used. A more common such
approach is based is theory of vertex operators (see e.g. [18] and references therein) which
is somewhat closer to what is used in the physics literature than the approach in [16]. For
the convenience of the reader we present our results using the latter approach but, for
some technical proofs, we use results in [16]. More details on the relations between the two
approaches, and a complementary derivation of the identity in (1.3), can be found in [32].
Notation: We use the symbol ‘≡” to emphasize a deﬁnition. We denote as C, R, Z the
complex, real, and integer numbers, N are the positive integers, and N0 ≡ N ∪ {0}. We
denote as (cid:61)(c) and ¯c the imaginary part and complex conjugate of c ∈ C, respectively, and
√
c¯c. We do not distinguish a complex number c and c×(identity operator). We use
|c| =
physics notation in our construction of the CFT Hilbert space F; for example, A† is the
Hilbert space adjoint of an operator A on F, (cid:104)η|η(cid:48)(cid:105) is the Hilbert space inner product of
two states η, η(cid:48) ∈ F, |0(cid:105) is the vacuum in F, etc.; note also that (cid:104)·|·(cid:105) is linear in the second
argument. For vectors x = (x1, . . . , xN ), we write |x| short for x1 + ··· + xN . Moreover,
1≤j<k≤N , etc. We use standard deﬁnitions, terminology and results
concerning partitions (see e.g. Macdonald’s book [11], Section I). In particular, (cid:96)(λ) is the
number of non-zero parts of a partitions λ, and this is ﬁnite for all partitions we mention.

(2.1) deﬁnes a deformation of the standard CS model by the parameter M in the sense of
Chalykh, Feigin, and Veselov [3]. This deformed CS model is quantum integrable, i.e., there
exist (suﬃciently many) diﬀerential operators commuting with HN,M in (2.1), including the

respectively (this follows from results in [4, 9]; see Appendix A.1.1 for further details).

It is tempting to interpret the deformed CS model as a quantum many-body system
describing two diﬀerent kinds of identical particles, in generalization of an important physics
interpretation of the standard CS model. However, this interpretation is problematic since
the eigenstates in (2.2)–(2.3) are not square-integrable in the usual sense and, at least
for g > 0, one of the particle mass parameters is negative. Moreover, by introducing
Planck’s constant , one can see that the classical limit  → 0 of the deformed CS model
is independent of M , i.e., the deformed model does not have a classical counterpart [3].

In the rest of this paper we sometimes abuse physics terminology and refer to HN,M in
(2.1), DN,M in (2.5), and Ψ0 in (2.3) as dCS Hamiltonian, momentum operator, and dCS
groundstate, respectively.

2.2 Super Jack polynomials and pseudo-momenta

We give further details about the super Jack polynomials. We also introduce ﬁnite integer
vectors n that are in one-to-one correspondence with partitions λ in the fat (N, M )-hook
and that we need later on.

of the Macdonald parameter α [11] and equal to the parameters k and θ in [4] and [9],
respectively). The Jack polynomials have an expansion

(note that this function is obtained from the one in (2.3) by replacing sin(z) by (eiz − e−iz),

M = 0, the exponential factor in (2.12) describes a center-of-mass motion which is often
omitted in the standard CS model. However, this exponential factor will be important role
for us.

One way to see that the integer vectors n in (2.11) are useful to label eigenfunctions is
that they allow to express the eigenvalues of the deformed CS model in (2.6) in a simple

(cid:104)0|RQ|0(cid:105) = δQ,0 ∀Q ∈ Z

(we set R0 ≡ I and R−Q ≡ (R†)Q). We recall the construction of F: the relations above

(m1, m2, . . .)). We denote the set of ﬁnite linear combinations of states in (3.3) as Db. This
is obviously a pre-Hilbert space. The Hilbert space F is obtained from Db by completion.
We note that ˆρ0 has the physical interpretation as a charge operator, and thus R is a

charge raising operator.

reason for our restriction on the statistics parameter: ν/ν0 ∈ Z is important since only
integer powers of the operator R are well-deﬁned [33].

It is known that these vertex operators satisfy the exchange relations

φν(cid:48)(y)φν(x) for x ≷ y;

(3.7)

see e.g. [16]. In particular, if ν2 = m is an odd integer, then φν(x) are fermion operators;
for m = 1 they are standard chiral fermions, and for odd integers m > 1 they correspond

8

to composite fermions [24]. However, the results discussed here hold true for arbitrary real
ν and, in general, the operators φν(x) correspond to anyons [34].

Wen’s eﬀective theory of the FQHE at ﬁlling 1/m, m an odd integer, corresponds to the
composite fermion case ν2 = m [24]. As discussed in the next section, even if one is only
m, one is naturally
interested in the composite fermions with statistics parameter ν =

3.2 Collective ﬁeld representation of the deformed CS model
We consider operators Hν,k in this anyon model which implement non-negative integer
powers of the generator of translations as follows,

It is easy to see that the vacuum state |0(cid:105) is a common eigenstate of the operators Hν,1,

Hν,2, and Hν,3, and the corresponding eigenvalues are all 0. More generally, the states

|Q(cid:105) ≡ RQ|0(cid:105)

(Q ∈ Z)

(3.13)

are common eigenstates of these operators, and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by

are invariant under this duality, i.e.,

˜Hν,k = ˜H−1/ν,k

(k = 1, 2, 3).

We now assume that also the operators φ−1/ν(x) are well-deﬁned, i.e., not only ν but
√
also 1/ν is an integer multiple of ν0. It is easy to see that this imposes a restriction on ν0
and ν: ν = rν0 and 1/ν = sν0 imply ν0 = 1/

rs and ν =(cid:112)r/s, or equivalently,

ν2 =

r

,

(r, s ∈ N).

(3.18)

It it natural to assume that r and s are co-prime (since then r and s are uniquely determined
by g = ν2). However, the latter assumption is not necessary: many of our results hold true
for an arbitrary pair of positive integers (r, s) satisfying the condition g = r/s > 0. This
generalization is sometimes interesting; see, for example, Lemma 4.2.

The object of interest are the following products of anyons with statistics parameters ν

and −1/ν:

ΦN,M

ν

(x, y) ≡ φν(x1)··· φν(xN )φ−1/ν(y1)··· φ−1/ν(yM ).

One can show that these are well-deﬁned as quadratic forms provided that

0 > (cid:61)(x1) > ··· > (cid:61)(xN ) > (cid:61)(y1) > ··· > (cid:61)(yM )

(details to prove this can be found in [35], Section 3.C, for example). Moreover,

the dCS groundstate in (2.13) for g = ν2 (this is a special case of (3.8)). This
identity allows to analytically continue the deﬁnition of the operators in (3.19) to other
values of xj and yk.

We now are ready to state our result (recall the deﬁnitions in (3.10)–(3.13) and (3.19)).

As mentioned in the introduction, our main result is (3.22c). However, we also need the

identities in (3.22a) and (3.22b).

3.3 Proof of Proposition 3.1

The proof is based on results obtained in [16], with technical improvements in [36, 37].

4 Diagonalization of Hν,3
We show that the collective ﬁeld Hamiltonian Hν,3 of the deformed CS model in (3.12)
deﬁnes an exactly solvable system in the sense that its eigenstates and corresponding eigen-
values can be constructed explicitly. Our result is based on Proposition 3.1 and the theory
of super Jack polynomials [4, 9]; see Proposition 4.1.

It is important to note that, for technical reasons, our results in this section are restricted
to integer g > 0. As mentioned in the introduction, we give a complementary construction
of eigenstates of Hν,3 without this restriction in Appendix B.

4.1 Super Jack states

As discussed in Section 2.2, from the mathematical theory of super Jack polynomials we
know explicit formulas for common eigenfunctions ΨN,M
q0,n , and corresponding eigenvalues, of
the deformed CS diﬀerential operators HN,M in (2.1) and DN,M in (2.5); see (2.7)–(2.15).
Using these eigenfunctions, we deﬁne states

Q,n ≡
˜ψN,M

dN x dM y ΨN,M

q0,n (x, y; ν2)ΦN,M

ν

(x, y)|Q(cid:105)

(4.1)

(cid:90)

(we ignore technical details here; see (4.3)–(4.5) below for a precise deﬁnition). It turns out
that, with suitable q0, the integral in (4.1) deﬁnes a state in F. Moreover, the following
simple computation, which uses Proposition 3.1 and that ΨN,M
q0,n in (2.12) is an eigenstate of
HN,M with known eigenvalue E(3)
q0,n in (2.15b), shows that these states are exact eigenstates

(A proof, which includes explicit formulas for the states ˜ψN,M

norm, is given in Section 4.3.)

We believe that it is possible to extend this result, as it stands, to all rational g > 0,

but this is challenging.

Note that n+
j

in (4.8) is equal to the pseudo-momenta of the deformed CS model in
(2.14) for q0 in (4.6) and g = ν2. Moreover, one can write the formulas for the eigenvalues

We mention one technical point: we prove that the states in (4.3)–(4.4) are in the
CFT Fock space F, but we expect that they are actually in the domain Db of ﬁnite boson
vectors. One reason why we believe this is the complementary algorithm to construct
common eigenstates of Hν,k, k = 1, 2, 3, in Appendix B. This algorithm gives eigenstates in
Db with the same eigenvalues as in (4.7) and which we therefore expect to be the same as
the states obtained in Proposition 4.1. It would be interesting to have a proof for this.

4.2 Completeness

It is interesting to know if the states obtained in Proposition 4.1 provide a complete or-
thogonal basis in the Fock space F. The following results due to van Elburg and Schoutens
[25] suggests an answer to this questions.

(Recall that Hν,2 is the CFT Hamiltonian in (3.11), and the deﬁnition of the integers

r, s in (3.18) ﬀ.)

Lemma 4.2. Let ˜ηN,M
Q ∈ Z and n ∈ NN +M

such that

Q,n be a set of linearly independent states in Db labeled by N, M ∈ N0,

Q,n and g = r/s ∈ N, but we need the more general

Q,n = ˜ψN,M

apply this result below to ˜ηN,M
result in Appendix B.)

The identity in (4.12) is of Rogers-Ramanujan type. We checked this remarkable identity
extensively using MAPLE and, for this reason, are convinced that it is true. However, we do
not know its mathematical status. The reason for why we did not invest more eﬀort in this
questions is that we cannot rule out the possibility that the states ˜ψN,M
Q,n in Proposition 4.1,
with Q and n restricted as in (4.10), are linearly dependent. For this reason, Lemma 4.2
and Proposition 4.1 do not imply that these states are a complete orthogonal basis even if
the identity in (4.12) is proved. In particular, there exist states with degenerate eigenvalues
EN,M
k,Q,n, k = 1, 2, 3, and such states could be linearly dependent (this degeneracy problem
is discussed in more detail in Appendix B). However, we do not believe that this happens
for the following reasons. As mentioned, there exists a family of commuting diﬀerential
operators D(k)

Moreover, the functions in (2.12) ﬀ are common eigenfunctions of all these diﬀerential
operators with known eigenvalues. We believe that all these diﬀerential operators have
collective ﬁeld representations by self-adjoint commuting operators Hν,k on F, and these
In fact, in the CS case M = 0,
allow to generalize the result in (3.1) to k = 4, 5, . . ..
a collective ﬁeld representation Hν,4 of the diﬀerential operators D(4)
N,0 was constructed in
[23] (such operator is also given in [38], Remark 4 in Section 4), and in Ref. [26] such
operators are constructed for all k (in a framework diﬀerent from ours). We believe that
these operators are collective ﬁeld representations of the deformed CS operators D(k)
N,M as
well. If so, then the states in Proposition 4.1 are common eigenstates of all these operators
Hν,k, and this would not leave any room for diﬀerent such states to not be orthogonal. This
still would not rule out the possibility that some of these states are zero. However, in the
proof of Proposition 4.1 we obtain explicit formulas for the Hilbert space norms of these
states by integrals (see (4.21)–(4.22)) and, from these formulas, we think this is unlikely.
We thus conjecture that the states in (4.3)–(4.6), with N, M ∈ N0, Q ∈ Z and NN,M

such that (4.10) holds true, provide a complete orthogonal basis in F.

4.3 Proof of Proposition 4.1

We start with a result which links the product of vertex operators ΦN,M
in (3.19) with
deformed Newton sums pN,M
in (2.8)–(2.9). As preparation we note that a integer vec-
tor m = (m1, m2, . . .) of inﬁnite length, with non-negative mn and only ﬁnitely many
mn non-zero, are in one-to-one correspondence with partitions λ = (λ1, λ2, . . .) by the
following representation of partitions, λ ˆ=(1m1, 2m2, . . .), for example, the partition λ =
(5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0) ˆ=(11, 23, 42, 51) corresponds to the integer vector m with the following

non-zero components, m1 = m5 = 1, m2 = 3, m4 = 2. It thus makes sense to deﬁne a

note that the integrand in (4.18) is unchanged if all variables xj and yk are translated by
the same constant and, for this reason, the integral is unchanged if all j, 1 ≤ j ≤ N + M ,
are shifted by the same amount. Since, for ﬁxed η ∈ Db, the scalar product (cid:104)η|Q, λ(cid:105) is

5 Super Jack polynomials from CFT states

We shortly discuss one applications of Proposition 3.1 to the mathematical theory of super
Jack polynomials.

We present a mapping from common eigenstates η of the CFT operators Hν,k, k = 1, 2, 3,
to eigenfunctions of deformed CS model. The key result below is a simple consequence of
Proposition 3.1 and a straightforward extension of a result in [16].

(Recall the deﬁnitions in (2.8)–(2.13), (3.3) ﬀ, (3.13) and (3.19).)

Corollary 5.1. Let η ∈ Db be a common eigenstate of the operators Hν,k in (3.10)–(3.12)
with corresponding eigenvalues Ek for k = 1, 2, 3. Then

conclude that the function P N,M
function need not be a polynomial.

As an application of this result, one can take for η the states in Proposition 4.1 but for

(this is obtained by computations similar to ones in Section 4.3). Note, however, that we
only could prove that the states in Proposition 4.1 are in F and (and not on Db as is needed
justify the use or Corollary 5.1). For this reason the computations leading to (5.32)–(5.33)
above are formal, and we only give these formulas since we ﬁnd them suggestive. It would be
interesting to make them precise and thus establish a map between super Jack polynomials
with diﬀerent variable numbers (N(cid:48), M(cid:48)) and (N, M ), in generalization of results in [9].

We mention that a similar relation between super Jack polynomials with diﬀerent vari-
able numbers was previously found in [12] using a diﬀerent method. In fact, we checked that
the results in [12] are obtained by applying the map in Corollary 5.1 to the orthogonalized
Q (n) constructed in Appendix B (in this case, η ∈ Db is established, and
anyon states ˜ηN,M
the result obtained is mathematically precise). Thus the results in this paper provide a
quantum ﬁeld theory interpretation of results in [12]. It is worth mentioning that this clar-
iﬁes some puzzling aspect of the results in [12]. In particular, the generalized commutator
relations of the Fourier modes of the anyon operators (see (B.29) and (B.30)) explain why
certain states constructed in [12], and which should not exist, are indeed zero. It is worth
noting that the results in [12] where not only for the (deformed) CS model, but for a large
class of quantum Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models. It would be interesting to establish
results like in this paper for other such systems.

6 Concluding remarks

The FQHE is observed in certain 2D electron systems where the Hall conductance has
plateaus at values which are fractional multiples of the natural constant e2/h. The fractions
thus measured have a striking accuracy (see e.g. Fig. 1 in [17]), and a convincing theoretical
explanation of this eﬀect can therefore not be based on approximation methods. This has
been a major challenge, but physicists have been able to identify integrable structures in
models that can explain the FQHE. We hope that the result in this paper can contribute to
make further progress on this. As one speciﬁc possibility, we mention recent work proposing
a occupations-number-like picture for FQHE states based on Jack polynomials [29]. In that
work, Jack polynomials for negative rational values of the parameter α = 1/g [10] are
used. For such values of α, the interpretation of the corresponding CS model as quantum-
many body system is not possible, and the corresponding CFT is not unitary. Our results
suggest that the deformed CS model can provide further interesting fractional quantum
Hall states. It is tempting to speculate that the latter states for positive rational α could
be an alternative to the states proposed in [29], and that this would provide a link to Wen’s
theory [24]. We hope that our result will inspire future work in this direction.

22

Wen’s theory [24] has been very successful to explain many aspects of the FQHE. As
discussed in [25], an orthogonalized anyon basis should be very useful to compute quantities
of interest for physicists which previously were not accessible. We hope that our result in
Proposition 4.1 will help to establish the theory of super Jack polynomials as a useful tool
in such computations.

Our results also motivate future research on the theory of super Jack polynomials. One
speciﬁc example is Proposition 4.1 which, for technical reasons, we only could prove for
integer values of g (which, fortunately, include the cases of main interest for the FQHE). The
extension of this result to rational g requires analytical results about super Jack polynomials
which, to our knowledge, do not exists. We hope to come back to this in future work. Other
examples are discussed in Section 5.

A Details and proofs

Some of the results used in the main text are technical or can be proved by simple adaptation
of results available in the literature. In this appendix we collect some of these proofs for
the convenience of the reader.

A.1 Apropos Section 2

A.1.1 dCS eigenvalues for λ = 0

We give details on how the constants E(1,2)

0

in (2.6) are obtained.

It is obvious that ΨN,M

0

(x, y; g) in (2.3) is invariant if all variables xj and yk are shifted

by the same constant. Thus DN,M ΨN,M

0 = 0, which implies E(1)

0 = 0.

The constant E(1)
0

in (2.6b) can be obtained from Proposition 2.1 in [39] as the special
case q = 0, N = N + M , mJ = 1 for 1 ≤ J ≤ N , and mJ = −1/λ for N + 1 ≤ J ≤ N = M
(note that g here corresponds to λ in [39]).

A.1.2 Eigenvalue identities

We show how (2.15) is obtained from (2.6).

23

We ﬁrst consider the special case q0 = 0 when the function in (2.12) is identical to the
one in (2.2). In this case the eigenvalues in (2.6) and (2.15) are the same, as is seen by
straightforward computations using the following relations between a partition µ and its

Recalling q0 in (4.6) one sees that the exponential factor here exactly cancels the one in
(A.4).
It is straightforward to generalize this
computation to non-zero Q, and one ﬁnds that the result does not depend on Q.

Inserting (A.2) we obtain (4.21)–(4.22).

A.2.3 Completeness

We obtained Lemma 4.2 from a result in [25], Appendix A using the following dictionary
between the notation in [25] and ours:

M ES = N, N ES = M, QES = −Q,

j = nN +1−j + M (1 ≤ j ≤ N ), nES
mES

k = nN +M +1−k

rES = r,

sES = s,
(1 ≤ k ≤ M ).

(A.6)

We checked that, with these identiﬁcations, the eigenvalues of Hν,3 in (4.7c) agree with the
results reported in [25], Section V.A.

2rsQ2 +(cid:80)

Lemma (4.2) can be proved by computing the partition function Z ≡ TrF (exp(−βHν,2))
for the operators Hν,2 in (3.11) in tho diﬀerent ways: First, using the boson states ηb
in (3.3), which are a complete orthonormal basis of eigenstates of Hν,2 with corresponding
n>0 nmn; Z computed in this way is equal to the l.h.s. in (4.12)
eigenvalues
with q = e−β. Second, using the states ˜ηN,M
2,Q,n in (4.7b) and (4.8);
straightforward computations show that Z then becomes equal to the r.h.s. in (4.12) if the
(cid:3)
labels are constrained as in (4.10). This proves Lemma 4.2.

B Orthogonalized anyon basis

One initial motivation for the project leading to this paper was to work out the construction
of anyon basis suggested in [25] but for all particles numbers (N, M ), in generalization of
previous results [16]. In this appendix we present this generalization since, as we believe,
is a useful complement to the result in Proposition 4.1: it is less elegant but, at the same
time, not restricted to rational g, and it gives eigenstates which, by construction, are in Db.
Moreover, in comparison with the special cases studied before, there are additional technical
diﬃculties which make the generalization less straightforward than one might expect.

B.1 Anyon basis
Recall (3.18) and that Db is the set of ﬁnite linear combinations of boson states as in (3.3).
For generic ν0 and ν ∈ ν0Z, the vertex operator φν(x) in (3.6) is not 2π-periodic in the
variable x due the presence of the factors exp(−iνQx/2). However, the modiﬁed vertex
operators

ˇφν(x) ≡ eiνQx/2φν(x)eiνQx/2
are 2π-periodic and can be Fourier transformed as follows,

(B.1)

(B.2)

ˆφν(n) ≡

ˇφν(x)einxdx,

( > 0, n ∈ Z).

The Fourier modes ˆφν(n) are well-deﬁned operators on F:

(cid:90) π−i

−π−i

26

Lemma B.1. For all n ∈ Z and ν ∈ ν0Z, ˆφν(n) deﬁned in (B.2) is independent of  and
a well-deﬁned operator mapping Db to Db. In particular, for all states |Q(cid:105) = RQ|0(cid:105),

ˆφν(0)|Q(cid:105) = |Q + ν/ν0(cid:105)

(Q ∈ Z).

(B.3)

(See Section B.3.1 for proof.)
Set ν = rν0 so that 1/ν = sν0. Then Lemma B.1 implies that, for arbitrary N, M ∈ N0,

Q ∈ Z and n = (n1, . . . , nN +M ) ∈ ZN +M , the state

Q (n) ≡ ˆφν(n1)··· ˆφν(nN ) ˆφ−1/ν(nN +1)··· ˆφ−1/ν(nN +M )|Q(cid:105)
ηN,M

(B.4)
is well-deﬁned and in Db. Due to the highest weight condition in (3.2), this state is non-zero
under certain restrictions on the integer vectors n:
Lemma B.2. The state ηN,M
following conditions on the integer vector n are fulﬁlled,

Q (n) deﬁned in (B.4) is in Db and non-zero only if all the

nj + nj+1 + ··· + nN +M ≥ 0 ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , N + M.

(See Section B.3.2 for proof).

We observe that the states in (B.4) can be computed as

(3.10)–(3.12) on the states ηN,M

(The proof is given in Appendix B.3.4.)

It is important to note that the states in (B.4) are not linearly independent: the opera-
tors ˆφν(n) and ˆφ−1/ν(n) obey generalized commutator relations [40] (we give the relations in
Appendix B.3.5) and, as suggested by results discussed in Section 4.2, one can restrict the
quantum numbers n and Q by the conditions in (4.10) ﬀ. Note that (B.5) is automatically
fulﬁlled if (4.10) holds true, but this former restrictions still is important since it shows
that the sum on the r.h.s. in (B.9c) at most has a ﬁnite number of non-zero terms and thus
is well-deﬁned.

B.2 Orthogonalization

Corollary B.3 shows that the states ηN,M
Q (n) are special in that they are common eigen-
functions of the operators Hν,1 and Hν,2. Thus one expects that these states, with Q and n
restricted as in (4.10), provide a useful basis in applications like, for example, computations
of quantities of interest for physicists in Wen’s eﬀective theory of the FQHE [24]. However,
this basis has a serious drawback: it is not orthogonal. As suggested in [25], one can improve
this basis by ﬁnding linear combinations of these states ηN,M
Q (n) which also are eigenstates
of Hν,3. Examples of this orthogonalization were given in [25] for (N, M ) = (1, 1) and in
[16] for (N, M ) = (N, 0), N arbitrary, and (0, M ), M arbitrary. We now extend this con-
struction to all (N, M ) using (B.9c). As we will see, this extension is non-trivial, i.e., there
is an additional complication as compared to the special cases (N, M ) = (1, 1), (N, 0), and
(0, M ) mentioned.

We now explain the construction of these improved states. For that we note that Hν,3
Q (n) in (B.4) like a triangular matrix if one uses the partial ordering

acts on the states ηN,M
(cid:22) between integer vectors n, m in ZN +M deﬁned as follows,

m (cid:22) n :⇔ mj + ··· + mN +M ≤ nj + ··· nN +M ∀j = 1, 2, . . . , N + M.

(B.10)

Indeed, it is clear from (B.9c) that, if one acts repeatedly with Hν,3 on ηN,M
obtains a linear combination of states ηN,M

Q (m) with

Q (n), one always

N +M(cid:88)

m = n +

µjk(ej − ek), µjk ∈ N0 ∀j < k,

(B.11)

and m (cid:22) n for all such m. This suggests that it is possible to construct eigenstates ˜ηN,M
of Hν,3 as linear superpositions of these states ηN,M
be computed by diagonalizing a triangular matrix:

Q (n)

Q (m)
is non-zero only for ﬁnitely many m as in (B.11), and thus there are only ﬁnitely many
cases m ≺ n to be considered (for other m one can set un(m) = 0).

(B.11) fulﬁlling the conditions (cid:80)N +M

Thus eigenstates of Hν,3 can be constructed in this manner provided the following non-
degeneracy condition is fulﬁlled: The integer vector n is such that, for all m of the form
k=j mj ≥ 0 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , N + M , the eigenvalue

diﬀerences bn(m) in (B.14) are non-zero.

(M = 0)
(N = 0)
(N = M = 1)

At this point the restriction in (4.10) becomes important: inserting (4.7c) into (B.14)

one ﬁnds for the special cases (N, M ) = (N, 0), (0, M ) and (1, 1) mentioned above

(B.16)
k<j µkj. This proves that, in these special cases, the non-degeneracy
condition is always fulﬁlled provided (4.10) holds true: Since nj > nj(cid:48) for 1 ≤ j < j(cid:48) ≤ N
and nk > nk(cid:48) for N + 1 ≤ k < k(cid:48) ≤ N + M , bn(m) is manifestly positive and manifestly
negative in the cases (N, M ) = (N, 0) and (0, M ), respectively. Moreover, for the case
(N, M ) = (1, 1), positivity of bn(m) follows from m2 = n2 − µ12 ≥ 0 and n1 ≥ 1. Un-
fortunately, for general (N, M ), we cannot rule out bn(m) = 0 by (4.10) in such a simple
manner. However, we stress that we expect that degeneracies are an exception: generically,
the algorithm above should work (but we cannot prove this).

We summarize the construction above as follows (recall the deﬁnition of (cid:22) in (B.10)).

Proposition B.4. Let Q ∈ Z and n ∈ NN +M
such that the no-degeneracy condition above is
fulﬁlled, e.g., (N, M ) = (N, 0), (0, M ) or (1, 1), and Q and n satisfy the conditions in (4.10).
Q (n) ∈ Db is given by (B.12) with coeﬃcients un(m) determined by
Then a unique state ˜ηN,M
the following ﬁnite recursion procedure: un(m) = 0 if m (cid:31) n, un(n) = 1, un(m) is given

0

29

by (B.15)–(B.14) if m is as in (B.11) such that (cid:80)N +M

k=j mk ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , N + M ,
and un(m) = 0 otherwise. Moreover, provided this state ˜ηN,M
Q (n) is non-zero, it is a
common eigenstate of the operators Hν,1, Hν,2 and Hν,3 in (3.10)–(3.12) with corresponding
eigenvalues given in (4.7).

(The proof is given in the paragraphs containing (B.10)–(B.14), except for the common
eigenfunction property. The latter is a single consequence of results stated in Corollary B.3.)

As emphasized in Proposition B.4, it is possible that a state ˜ηN,M

Q (n) constructed with
this algorithm is zero. As an example we mention a case (N, M ) = (2, 0) where the
algorithm gives the following state ˜η(n) ≡ ˜η2,0
ν,0(n) for n = (1, 2) (note that this n does not
satisfy the condition in (4.10)),

˜η(1, 2) = ˜η(1, 2) + (g − 1)˜η(2, 1) + 1

2g(g − 1)˜η(3, 0),

(B.17)

but this state can be shown to be zero by using the generalized commutator relation in
(B.29). However, we found that this happens only for states with integer vectors n not
satisfying the condition in (4.10).

Remark B.5. We note that it is possible to modify the algorithm described in the Proposi-
tion B.4 as follows (in the following we denote the set of all integer vectors n satisfying the
Q (m) in (B.13) appears where m /∈ S,
condition in (4.10) as S): in cases where a state ηN,M
Q (k) with k ∈ S before solving for
rewrite this state as a linear combination of states ηN,M
un(m) (this rewriting can be done using (B.29)–(B.30)). Doing this, the non-degeneracy
condition bn(m) (cid:54)= 0 would only have to hold true for integer vectors m ∈ S appearing in
this modiﬁed algorithm, and this is probably fulﬁlled for many more integer vectors n ∈ S.

in the deﬁnition (B.1)–(B.2), expanding the exponentials in Taylor series, and performing

mathematically precise by interpreting the operators as quadratic forms on Db (a collection
of mathematical results needed for that can be found in [35], Appendix C). It thus is clear
that ˆφν(n), for arbitrary ν ∈ ν0Z, is a linear combination of terms

(B.19)
with non-zero integers (cid:96)j such that (cid:96)1 ≥ (cid:96)2 ≥ ··· ≥ (cid:96)L (note that the (cid:96)j can be negative),
and only a ﬁnite number of these terms give a non-zero result when acting on a state in

Db. It is easy to prove that operators as in (B.19) map Db to Db, and thus the same is true
for ˆφν(n).

with M ∈ N0 and mj ∈ N such that m1+···+mM = m. This is obviously a subset of Db, and
Db is equal to the union of all these spaces. Using repeatedly ˆρ−(cid:96) ˆρ−mj = ˆρ−mj ˆρ−(cid:96) − (cid:96)δmj +(cid:96),0
and ˆρ(cid:96)|Q(cid:105) = 0 for (cid:96) > 0, one sees that, for all η ∈ Dm,Q, ˆρ−(cid:96)η ∈ Dm+(cid:96),Q for m + (cid:96) ≥ 0
and ˆρ−(cid:96)η = 0 otherwise. Thus the operators in (B.19) map Dm,Q to Dm+n,Q if m + n ≥ 0
and to 0 otherwise and, since ˆφν(n) is a ﬁnite linear combination of such operators (see
Section B.3.1), the same is true for ˆφν(n). Thus the states in (B.4) are either 0 or in D|n|,Q
j=1 nj, and they are non-zero only if the conditions in (B.5) are fulﬁlled. (cid:3)

with |n| =(cid:80)N +M

Remark B.7. Lemma B.2 is a generalization of Proposition 3 in [16].

B.3.3 Proof of Equations (B.6)–(B.8) and (4.8)

We note the identity

eicQRQ = eiν0cQRQeicQ (Q ∈ Z, c ∈ C)

(B.22)
which follows from the second relation in (3.1). Using this, and since (cid:104)η, ΦN,M
(x, y)|0(cid:105) is
an analytic function for all η ∈ Db in the region deﬁned (3.20), it is clear that the r.h.s. in
(B.4) can be written as an integral on the r.h.s. in (B.6) with j as in (B.7) and computable
j . To compute the these parameters we use that, for all K ∈ N, νj ∈ ν0Z,
parameters n+

B.3.5 Generalized commutator relations
One can show that the following generalized commutator relations hold true on Db,

(cid:19)
(−1)(cid:96)(cid:16) ˆφµ(n + (cid:96)) ˆφµ(m − (cid:96)) − ˆφµ(m + (cid:96)) ˆφµ(n − (cid:96))

ˆφν(n) ˆφ−1/ν(m) + ˆφ−1/ν(m + 1) ˆφν(n − 1) = ˆφν−1/ν(n + m).

(B.30)

By using repeatedly these relations and Lemma B.2, any state ηN,M
Q (n) in (B.4) can be
written as a ﬁnite linear combination of such states with integer vectors n satisfying n1 ≥
··· ≥ nN ≥ M and nN +1 ≥ ··· ≥ nN +M ≥ 0. The number of independent such states is
further reduced by (B.3), which implies

ηN,M
Q (n) = ηN,K

Q−(M−K)s(n) if nN +K+1 = ··· = nN +M = 0

(B.31)
for all integers K in the range 0 ≤ K ≤ M (recall that 1/(ν0ν) = s). To ﬁnd the restriction
on Q so as to get a complete basis of linearly independent states is non-trivial. A solution
of this problem was given in [25], Appendix A; see Lemma 4.2.
