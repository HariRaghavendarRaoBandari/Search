Abstract. We consider a diﬀuse interface approximation for the lipid phases of rotationally
symmetric two-phase bilayer membranes and rigorously derive its Γ-limit. In particular, we
prove that limit vesicles are C 1 across interfaces, which justiﬁes a regularity assumption that
is widely made in formal asymptotic and numerical studies. Moreover, a limit membrane
may consist of several topological spheres, which are connected at the axis of revolution and
resemble complete buds of the vesicle.
Keywords: Γ-convergence, phase ﬁeld model, lipid bilayer, two-phase membrane.

Introduction

Lipid bilayer membranes are an integral part of many biological systems and display a
rich variety of shapes and shape transformations; in particular, membranes that consist of
two or more lipid phases have a complex morphology aﬀected by the interplay of elastic
properties and phase separation [21, 9, 2]. The spontaneous curvature model for two-phase
lipid bilayer vesicles describes equilibrium shapes as surfaces minimising the energy

among all closed surfaces M = M + ∪ M−, M + ∩ M− = ∅ with prescribed areas for M±
[6, 12, 13, 15, 22]. Here H and K are the mean curvature and the Gauss curvature of the
membrane surface M , and µ is its area measure. The bending rigidities k± > 0 and the
Gauss rigidities k±
s – the so-called spontaneous
curvatures – are supposed to reﬂect an asymmetry in the membrane. In the simplest case,
the rigidities and spontaneous curvatures are constant within each lipid phase but diﬀerent
between the two phases. The length of the phase interfaces ∂M + = ∂M− is denoted by
H1(∂M +), and σ is a line tension parameter.

G are elastic material parameters, and H±

In [15] the Euler-Lagrange equations of (1.1) for axially symmetric two-phase mem-
branes with exactly one interface are studied. The authors mention the possibility of dif-
ferent smoothness conditions at the interface, their analysis, however, is done for smooth
membranes, which are C1 across the interface, only. Phase ﬁeld models for the lipid phases
and also the membrane surface are introduced in [10, 11, 28, 17] and studied numerically;
convergence to the sharp interface limit is obtained by asymptotic expansion and under
additional smoothness assumptions and topological restrictions.

In this paper we are interested in the convergence of a diﬀuse interface approximation
for the lipid phases in a rotationally symmetric setting without imposing smoothness or
the topological structure of limit vesicles in advance. More precisely, for a closed surface

Here the second integral, where W is a standard double well potential such as W (u) =
(1 − u2)2, is the diﬀuse interface energy from the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase transitions
[5] in the setting of surfaces. As ε → 0, the phase ﬁeld is forced to ±1, hence the ﬁrst
integral in (1.2) resembles the curvature integral in (1.1), provided that k(u), kG(u) and
Hs(u) are extensions of the given parameters k±, k±
s . We prove that, under
certain restrictions on these parameters, the Γ-limit of (1.2) is given by (1.1) for rotationally
symmetric membranes.
In particular, we obtain that sequences (γε, uε) with uniformly
bounded energy have a subsequence that converges to a limit membrane consisting of ﬁnitely
many regular topological spheres, which are connected at the axis of revolution. By our
assumption on the parameters and the approximation procedure, the limit model has the
property that membranes are C1 across interfaces. For an approach that allows tangent
singularities at interfaces in the limit see [14].

G and H±

Equi-coercivity and Γ-convergence also yield the existence of a minimiser for the limit
model. Upon completion of this work, we became aware of the preprint [7], where the
existence of energy-minimal two-phase membranes in a setting similar to our limit model
is studied and similar issues as in our equi-coercivity and lower bound arguments are ad-
dressed.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 recalls some facts about surfaces of revolu-
tion, in Section 3 we present our setting and state the convergence theorem. We prove the
theorem in Section 4 and conclude with some remarks on generalisations in Section 5.

2 Surfaces of revolution

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions and notation
Let I ⊂ R be an open bounded interval and γ = (x, y) : I → R2 a Lipschitz parametrised
curve in the upper half of the xy-plane, that is, y(t) ≥ 0 for all t ∈ I. We denote by Mγ the
surface in R3 obtained by rotating γ about the x-axis, thus Mγ is the image of I × [0, 2π)
under the Lipschitz continuous map

Φ : (t, θ) (cid:55)→ (x(t), y(t) cos θ, y(t) sin θ);

γ is called generating curve of Mγ. See [8, 16] for a detailed discussion of surfaces.
bounded derivative γ(cid:48), and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Since γ is Lipschitz continuous, it is weakly and almost everywhere diﬀerentiable with

γ(t1) − γ(t0) =

γ(cid:48)(t) dt

(cid:90) t1

t0

holds for all t0, t1 ∈ I. The length of γ is given by

(cid:90)

Lγ =

|γ(cid:48)(t)| dt,

and after removing at most countably many constancy intervals, pulling holes together and
reparametrising, we may assume that γ is parametrised with constant speed |γ(cid:48)| ≡ Lγ/|I| =:
qγ almost everywhere in I [4, Lemma 5.23].

By µ we denote the area measure of Mγ, that is dµ = |∂tΦ∧ ∂θΦ| dt dθ = |γ(cid:48)|y dt dθ, and

we write

Aγ =

|γ(cid:48)|y dt

for the area of Mγ. Moreover, for a measurable subset J of I, we let Mγ(J) be the part
of Mγ that is obtained by rotating the curve segment γ(J), and refer to the corresponding
length and area as Lγ(J) and Aγ(J), respectively. If γ is embedded, then also Mγ is, and
µ is the two-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure H2 restricted to Mγ; in general, however, the
multiplicity of µ may be larger than 1.
The tangent space T(t0,θ0)Mγ exists for almost every (t, θ) ∈ I × [0, 2π) and is the plane

spanned by the orthonormal vectors

(cid:0)x(cid:48), y(cid:48) cos θ, y(cid:48) sin θ(cid:1)

|γ(cid:48)|

(cid:0)−y(cid:48), x(cid:48) cos θ, x(cid:48) sin θ(cid:1) .

(2.2)

We associate tangent space, normal and all other geometric quantities to the parameter (t, θ)
and not to the point Φ(t, θ) on the surface Mγ, because Mγ is not necessarily embedded. For
the same reason, we consider a function f : Mγ → Rk to be a function F : I × [0, 2π) → Rk
of the parameters; on embedded parts of Mγ this amounts to f (Φ(t, θ)) = F (t, θ). Given
a tangent vector ξ at (t0, θ0) ∈ I × (0, 2π), the directional derivative of f in direction ξ is
deﬁned as

Dξf (t0, θ0) =

F (η(s))

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

where η : (−δ, δ) → I ×[0, 2π) is a C1-curve satisfying η(0) = (t0, θ0) and d
The tangential gradient of f : Mγ → R is

ds Φ(η(s))(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0 = ξ.

∇Mγ f = (Dξ1f )ξ1 + (Dξ2f )ξ2,

where {ξ1, ξ2} is any orthonormal basis of the tangent space; see [24, 16] for a detailed
discussion. For {ξ1, ξ2} as in (2.1), we ﬁnd Dξ1f = |γ(cid:48)|−1∂tF and Dξ2f = y−1∂θF , hence

∇Mγ f =

1

(∂θF )ξ2 =

1
|γ(cid:48)|2 (∂tF )∂tΦ +

y2 (∂θF )∂θΦ.

In particular, if f is rotationally symmetric, which means that it is independent of θ, then

∇Mγ f (t, θ) =

F (cid:48)(t)
|γ(cid:48)(t)| ξ1(t, θ)

and

|∇Mγ f (t, θ)| =

|F (cid:48)(t)|
|γ(cid:48)(t)| ,

where | · | is the Euclidean norm in R3.

For the rest of this subsection let γ ∈ W 2,1

loc (I; R2) be twice weakly diﬀerentiable, thus
twice diﬀerentiable almost everywhere, and y > 0 in I. Since ν in (2.2) is weakly diﬀeren-
tiable, the shape operator S : T(t0,θ0)M → T(t0,θ0)M , ζ (cid:55)→ Dζν and the second fundamental
form B : T(t0,θ0)M ×T(t0,θ0)M → R, (ζ, ξ) (cid:55)→ ξ·Dζν are well-deﬁned for almost every (t0, θ0).
The matrix representation with respect to the basis {ξ1, ξ2} in (2.1) of both is

The eigenvalues κ1, κ2 of S are the principal curvatures of Mγ, and κ1 is just the signed
curvature of γ with respect to the normal −γ(cid:48)⊥/|γ(cid:48)| = (y(cid:48),−x(cid:48))/|γ(cid:48)|. The mean curvature
H and the Gauss curvature K of Mγ are

H = trace S = κ1 + κ2

By |S|2 = κ2
we also write |B|2 = |S|2. Obviously, we have |B|2 = H 2 − 2K.

The signs of the principal curvatures and the mean curvature depend on the sign of the
normal ν. Our choice above ensures that a unit ball has outer unit normal ν as in (2.2)
and curvatures κ1 = κ2 = +1 when its generating curve is parametrised “from left to right”
such that x(cid:48) ≥ 0, for instance by γ(t) = (− cos t, sin t), t ∈ [0, π].
Let ϕ : I → R be an angle function for γ, that is, let ϕ(t) be the angle between the
positive x-axis and the tangent vector γ(cid:48)(t). Since W 2,1
loc, the angle ϕ can
be chosen continuously in I and is then uniquely determined up to multiples of 2π. In terms
of ϕ, the curve γ is characterised by ﬁxing one point and

x(cid:48) = |γ(cid:48)| cos ϕ,

y(cid:48) = |γ(cid:48)| sin ϕ.

to the axis of revolution at ∂I and we conclude(cid:82)

K dµ = 4π.

Another consequence of (2.3) is that for γ parametrised with constant speed qγ > 0 the

If Mγ is a closed surface, that is y(∂I) = {0}, κ2 seemingly degenerates at the axis of
revolution. However, if Mγ is suﬃciently smooth, the principal curvatures are still well-
deﬁned, for instance by taking another local parametrisation of Mγ; to compute κ2 in the
rotationally symmetric parametrisation, L’Hˆopital’s rule may be used and yields κ2 = κ1

2.2 Surfaces with L2-bounded second fundamental form

The sharp inequality y > 0 in I is not conserved by the convergence of curves that our
ε-energy yields. If merely y ≥ 0 in I, the set {y > 0} = {t ∈ I : y(t) > 0} is open and hence
is the union of its countably many connected components, which are disjoint open intervals.
In a slight abuse of language we also call Mγ(ω) a component of Mγ if ω is a component of
{y > 0}. Thus, Mγ consists of at most countably many components, which are connected
at the axis of revolution.

In the following lemma and corollary we collect some regularity properties of γ and Mγ
that follow from an L2-bound on the second fundamental form. The focus here is on regions
of {y > 0} near the axis of revolution.
Lemma 2.1. Let γ = (x, y) : I → R2, y ≥ 0 be a Lipschitz curve that satisﬁes γ ∈
loc ({y > 0} ; R2), |γ(cid:48)| ≡ qγ > 0 in {y > 0}, and
W 2,1

(cid:90)

|B|2 dµ < ∞.

Mγ ({y>0})

loc ({y > 0} ; R2) and y ∈ W 2,1({y > 0} ; R2). Moreover, for any
Then we have γ ∈ W 2,2
connected component ω = (a, b) of {y > 0} the curve γ belongs to C1(ω; R2) and has one-
sided derivatives γ(cid:48)(a) = −γ(cid:48)(b) = (0,|γ(cid:48)|), which means that γ is perpendicular to the axis
of revolution. The number of components of {y > 0} is ﬁnite.
Proof. On any set J (cid:98) {y > 0} the y-coordinate has a positive lower bound cJ in J, thus
γ ∈ W 2,2
loc ({y > 0}; R2) follows from (2.6); using 2|K| ≤ |B|2 and (2.5) we obtain y ∈
loc(ω) and y ∈ C1(ω) for
W 2,1({y > 0}). The Sobolev embedding theorem then yields x ∈ C1
any connected component ω = (a, b) of {y > 0}, and we aim to show that also x ∈ C1(ω).
Assume for contradiction that there are sequences tk → a, sk → a in ω such that
lim x(cid:48)(tk) (cid:54)= lim x(cid:48)(sk); if such sequences cannot be found, x(cid:48)(t) converges as t (cid:38) a. Since
γ − y(cid:48)(a)2, we have lim x(cid:48)(sk) = − lim x(cid:48)(tk) = m (cid:54)= 0 and
x(cid:48)(tk)2 and x(cid:48)(sk)2 converge to q2
x(cid:48)(tk) < −m/2 and x(cid:48)(sk) > m/2 for suﬃciently large k. Thus, there is rk ∈ (tk, sk) or
(sk, tk) such that x(cid:48)(rk) = 0, and from rk → a we infer that y(cid:48)2(a) = q2
γ. Consequently,
γ − y(cid:48)2(tk) → 0 in contradiction to our
we ﬁnd x(cid:48)2(sk) = q2
assumption. Since the same argument applies at t = b, we obtain x(cid:48) ∈ C1(ω).
Next, to prove that γ is perpendicular to the axis of revolution at a, we use y(t) ≤
(cid:18)
qγ(t − a) in ω and the second principle curvature of Mγ to deduce that

γ − y(cid:48)2(sk) → 0 and x(cid:48)2(tk) = q2

As |γ(cid:48)| = qγ and y > 0 in ω, we ﬁnd y(cid:48)(a) = −y(cid:48)(b) = qγ.
Finally, by the Gauss-Bonnet formula (2.4) we have

Corollary 2.2. Let γ = (x, y) be as in Lemma 2.1. Then Mγ has ﬁnitely many components
which are connected at the axis of revolution. Each component is an immersed C1-surface
and a W 2,2-surface in {y > 0}, that is, away from the axis of revolution.
Remark. The properties y ∈ W 2,1({y > 0}) and x ∈ C1({y > 0}), but x(cid:48) (cid:54)∈ W 2,1({y > 0})
in Lemma 2.1 are sharp, as the following example shows. Let

ψ(t) =

sin ln(1/t) + 1

ln(1/t)

for t ∈ (0, t0) with t0 suﬃciently small that ψ(t) ∈ [0, 1] for all t ∈ (0, t0) and consider

x(cid:48)(t) = cos (π/2 − ψ(t)) = sin ψ(t),

y(cid:48)(t) = sin (π/2 − ψ(t)) = cos ψ(t)

with x(0) = y(0) = 0. As t → 0, ψ(t) converges to 0 and we have x(cid:48)(t) ∼ ψ(t), y(cid:48)(t) ∼ 1,
and y(t) ∼ t for all small t, where a (cid:46) b denotes a ≤ Cb with a constant C > 0 and a ∼ b
means a (cid:46) b (cid:46) a. Thus we obtain

thus x (cid:54)∈ W 2,1((0, t0)). Furthermore, y(cid:48)(cid:48) = −ψ(cid:48) sin ψ ∼ −ψ(cid:48)ψ and

for any p > 1 yield y(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:54)∈ Lp((0, t0)). Note that Mγ is embedded due to x(cid:48) ≥ 0.

2.3 Length bound

To establish compactness of energy bounded sequences, we need bounds on the curves that
are derived from bounds on the curvature integrals in the energy. Two such results, which
are well-known and valid for arbitrary smoothly immersed surfaces, are [24, Lemma 1.1]
and [26], which relate the extrinsic and intrinsic diameter of a surface to its mean curvature.
The proof of both results hinges on the fact that in an arbitrary ball the mean curvature
and the area cannot be small at the same time; the diameter bounds are then obtained by
a covering argument. For closed surfaces of revolution, however, there is a straightforward
proof that the mean curvature integral bounds the length of the generating curve.
Lemma 2.3. Let γ = (x, y) ∈ C0,1(I; R2) ∩ W 2,1
and y(∂I) = {0}. Then

loc (I; R2) be a curve such that y(I) ⊂ (0,∞)

Proof. We may assume that the mean curvature integral is ﬁnite because otherwise there
is nothing to prove. Without loss of generality we also assume that γ : (0,Lγ) → R2 is
parametrised by arc length. If x(cid:48) ≥ 0 in I, there is an angle ϕ that is weakly diﬀerentiable
in I and satisﬁes ϕ ∈ [−π/2, π/2]. Then we obtain

Remark. The inequality in Lemma 2.3 is actually strict: equality in the above calculation
means ϕ sin ϕ + cos ϕ = 1, which holds only if ϕ ≡ 0 and is thus impossible for a nontrivial
closed surface of revolution. Moreover, the inequality is sharp, as can be seen by a cylinder
with spherical caps when the radius tends to zero.

Moreover, we require

Experimental measurements of the Gauss rigidity are scarce, but available data sug-
gest that for some membranes −1 < kG/(2k) < 0 and thus (3.2) are satisﬁed [23, 25].
Furthermore, our assumptions are mathematically motivated by the inequalities

Mγ

|H|2 dµ − C,

(3.3)

(3.4)

which are necessary to obtain a suitable compactness result and the Γ-convergence lower
bound; here C is a generic constant independent of γ. Indeed, expanding the quadratic
term on the left hand side of (3.4) and applying Young’s inequality with some δ > 0 to the
mixed term 2HHs yields

hence, (3.4) is satisﬁed, provided that kG(u) ≤ 0 and (3.2) hold. Then (3.3) is true, if
additionally the area of Mγ is prescribed.

Most interesting is the factor u2 in our deﬁnition of kG, which diﬀers from other diﬀuse
models for the lipid phases [11, 28] where the extended Gauss rigidities are bounded away
from 0. The latter studies do not consider topological changes in the limit, which, however,
is necessary to establish an equi-coercivity result. The purpose of the u2 is to allow the
construction of appropriate recovery sequences; see the end of Section 4.3.3 for the details.

(cid:110)

We study (3.1) for membranes (γ, u) ∈ Cε × Pε, where
(cid:90)

γ = (x, y) ∈ C0,1(I; R2) ∩ W 2,1
|γ(cid:48)| = const, y(∂I) = {0} , y(I) ⊂ (0,∞),

(cid:90)

Mγ

The ﬁrst three conditions in the deﬁnition of Cε ensure that γ is parametrised with constant
speed and that Mγ is a closed surface. The L2-bound on the second fundamental form of
Mγ together with the ﬁrst two conditions on the phase ﬁelds ensure that the energy (3.1) is
well-deﬁned on Cε × Pε. The requirement (cid:107)u(cid:107)∞ ≤ C0 with a large constant C0 (cid:29) 1 seems
rather strong, but phase ﬁelds with small energy are expected to be close to the interval
[−1, 1] anyway. In fact, in many places in the proof the L∞-bound can be replaced by a
less restrictive condition; compare [18, Proposition 3].

Although the set Pε depends on the chosen γ ∈ Cε via the phase area constraint, we
suppress this fact in the notation, because we usually consider pairs or membranes (γ, u).
Instead, we highlight the aﬃliation to the approximate energy by the index ε in Cε × Pε.
In the following, we write Mε instead of Mγε and so forth, when considering sequences (γε)
of curves. If necessary or useful for clariﬁcation we add the curve or ε as index to other
quantities such as Hγ, µγ, or yγ.
The energy (3.1) is invariant under reparametrisations that preserve the orientation and
the regularity properties of γ. In particular, if (γ, u) satisﬁes all requirements of Cε × Pε
but only |γ(cid:48)| (cid:54)= 0 instead of |γ(cid:48)| = const, the corresponding constant speed parametrisation
belongs to Cε × Pε and has the same energy. Hence, considering only |γ(cid:48)| = const is no
geometric restriction.

Here Su ⊂ {y > 0} denotes the countable jump set of u in {y > 0}, and we call s ∈ Su and
the corresponding circle Mγ({s}) an interface of (γ, u). The constant σ is given by

is the one-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure of the union of the countably many circles Mγ(Su).
The diﬀerence between Cε and C is that γ ∈ C may touch the axis of revolution also
in the interior of I, but this can happen only at ﬁnitely many points. For γ ∈ C we infer
from Lemma 2.1 and the subsequent corollary that Mγ consists of ﬁnitely many components
which are C1-surfaces and W 2,2-surfaces away from the axis of revolution.
The set P resembles the set of special functions of bounded variation SBV with values
in {±1}, weighted with the height y of the generating curve γ ∈ C. Indeed, for u ∈ P and
any J (cid:98) {y > 0} we have u ∈ SBV (J;{±1}), but as jumps of height 2 may accumulate
near the axis of revolution, u (cid:54)∈ SBV (I) in general. Points in {y = 0} can be jump points of
u or singular points where one or both one-sided limits are undeﬁned. We emphasise that
in our notation Su only contains points in {y > 0}, because the restriction of u to {y = 0}
does not contribute to the energy E.

Figure 3.1: Examples of embedded curves (1) and (3) in Cε that lead to non-embedded
limits (2) and (4), respectively, in C. The curves in (3) and (4) satisfy even the stronger
condition x(cid:48) ≥ 0 which prevents a component from touching itself, but diﬀerent components
may still touch each other in vertical segments near the axis of revolution.

3.3 Γ-convergence
We extend Eε and E to W 1,1(I; R2) × L1(I) by setting Eε(γ, u) = E(γ, u) = ∞ whenever
(γ, u) does not belong to Cε × Pε and C × P, respectively. Our approximation theorem is
the following.
Theorem 3.1. The energies Eε are equi-coercive, that is, any sequence (γε, uε) ∈ Cε × Pε
with uniformly bounded energy admits a subsequence that converges strongly in W 1,1(I; R2)×
L1(I) to some (γ, u) ∈ C × P. Furthermore, Eε Γ-converges to E as ε → 0, that is,

• for any sequence (γε, uε) that converges to some (γ, u) in W 1,1(I; R2)× L1(I) we have

Eε(γε, uε) ≥ E(γ, u);

lim inf
ε→0

• for any (γ, u) with ﬁnite energy E(γ, u) there is a recovery sequence (γε, uε) that con-

verges to (γ, u) in W 1,1(I; R2) × L1(I) and satisﬁes

Eε(γε, uε) ≤ E(γ, u).

lim sup

ε→0

Remark (Existence of minimisers). The energy Eε is bounded from below on Cε × Pε; thus,
there is a sequence (γε, uε) such that Eε(γε, uε) = inf Eε + o(1)ε→0. From equi-coercivity
and Γ-convergence we infer that a subsequence of (γε, uε) converges to a minimiser of E in
C × P, whose existence is thus established; see for instance [3] for the details.

Remark (Embeddedness). Our setting and result, which are entirely based on parametrisa-
tions, do neither need nor guarantee embeddedness. Even if Eε is considered only on the
subset of embedded membranes or for curves γ = (x, y) that satisfy the stronger “gener-
alised graph” condition x(cid:48) ≥ 0, which is preserved under our convergence, limit curves can
touch themselves; see Figure 3.1 for two examples.

The proof of Theorem 3.1 is divided into the three steps equi-coercivity, lower bound and
upper bound inequality.

|B|2 dµ ≥ C1

Mγ

This means, that Eε(γ, u) bounds the L2-norms of B and H as well as the L1-norm of the
Gauss curvature of Mγ. Since moreover Eε(γ, u) + C also bounds the phase ﬁeld energy
from above, compactness for curves and phase ﬁelds can be established separately.
Lemma 4.1. Let (γε, uε) ∈ Cε ×Pε be a sequence with uniformly bounded energy Eε(γε, uε).
Then there are γ = (x, y) ∈ C and a subsequence, not relabelled, such that

Proof. Let γε = (xε, yε) and |γ(cid:48)

which bounds the sequence (qε) from above. Furthermore, translations in x-direction do not
change the energy, so we may assume that all γε have a common end point and conclude
that (γε) is bounded in W 1,∞(I; R2). We can therefore extract a subsequence such that
∗
qε → q in R and γε
(cid:42) γ in W 1,∞(I; R2) = C0,1(I; R2); by compact embedding of W 1,∞ into
C0, the convergence of γε is uniform in I. This clearly implies y ≥ 0 and y(∂I) = {0}, but
also q > 0 and y (cid:54)≡ 0 because

Without loss of generality we assume q = 1, thus |γ(cid:48)| ≤ 1 almost everywhere in I.
Taking into account only the just selected subsequence, let ε be suﬃciently small so that
qε ≤ 2, and let J (cid:98) {y > 0} and cJ > 0 be such that y ≥ 2cJ in J. By uniform convergence
of yε we have yε ≥ cJ for all small ε, and (2.6) yields

weakly in L2(J; R2) to some γ(cid:48)(cid:48)

by Lemma 2.1 the number of components of {y > 0} is ﬁnite, we conclude H0({y = 0}) <
∞.
Lemma 4.2. Let (γε, uε) ∈ Cε × Pε and γ ∈ C be as in Lemma 4.1. Then there exist a
countable set S ⊂ I with S ∩ J ﬁnite for any J (cid:98) {y > 0} and u ∈ P with Su ⊂ S such that
for a subsequence uε → u in measure, almost everywhere in I, and in Lp(I) for p ∈ [1,∞).
Proof. We restrict ourselves to a subsequence of γε that converges to γ according to Lemma
4.1; as above, we let |γ(cid:48)
ε| ≡ qε and without loss of generality |γ(cid:48)| ≡ 1. Uniform convergence
implies that for J (cid:98) {y > 0} there is cJ > 0 such that yε ≥ cJ in J for all suﬃciently small
ε. Therefore, we have

and the well-known arguments of Modica and Mortola [18, 19] apply in J; see also [3,
Lemma 6.2 and Remark 6.3] for a proof in one dimension. The outcome is a ﬁnite set of
points SJ ⊂ J and a piecewise constant function u : J → {±1} whose jump set is contained
in SJ such that a subsequence of uε converges to u in measure and almost everywhere in
J \ S. Since (uε) is uniformly bounded in L∞(I), convergence in Lp(I) for any p < ∞
follows.
Exhausting {y > 0} by a sequence of increasing sets such as Jk = {y > 1/k} for k → ∞
and taking a diagonal sequence, we ﬁnd an at most countable set S ⊂ {y > 0} and a function
u : {y > 0} → {±1} whose jump set is contained in S. Moreover, a subsequence of (uε)
converges to u in measure and almost everywhere in {y > 0}. Then H0({y = 0}) < ∞ and
(cid:107)uε(cid:107)∞ ≤ C0 provide convergence in Lp(I) for any 1 ≤ p < ∞, and taking convergence of yε

Remark. In the classical one-dimensional setting without the area measure, a uniform L∞-
bound for the phase ﬁelds is in fact a result of the uniform energy bound; see [3]. In our
case, however, this bound depends in J (cid:98) {y > 0} on the constant cJ , which is essentially
the inﬁmum of y on J, and tends to inﬁnity as cJ → 0.

4.2 Lower bound

Next we prove the lower bound inequality

Eε(γε, uε) ≥ E(γ, u)

lim inf
ε→0

(4.4)
whenever (γε, uε) converges to (γ, u) in W 1,1(I; R2) × L1(I). It suﬃces to examine the case
when the left hand side of (4.4) is ﬁnite and to consider a subsequence such that the lower
limit is attained. Then by deﬁnition (γε, uε) ∈ Cε × Pε, and our compactness argument
yields (γ, u) ∈ C × P and the convergence properties listed in Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2.

Recalling the formulas κ1,ε = −γ(cid:48)(cid:48)
ε/(qεyε) for the principal curva-
loc ({y > 0} ; R2) implies weak convergence of Hε and Kε in

we deduce that there are points aε, bε ∈ J with aε < s < bε or bε < s < aε such that aε → s,
bε → s, uε(aε) → −1, and uε(bε) → 1 as ε → 0. Assuming without loss of generality that

4.3 Upper bound
We now construct a recovery sequence for (γ, u) with ﬁnite energy E(γ, u). To this end,
we ﬁrst show that (γ, u) can be approximated by membranes with ﬁnitely many interfaces.
For such a membrane, we then obtain a recovery sequence by changing the curve essentially
only near component boundaries and the phase ﬁeld only around interfaces and component
boundaries. Finally, a diagonal sequence recovers (γ, u).

Throughout this section we assume without loss of generality that |γ(cid:48)| ≡ 1.

4.3.1 Approximation by ﬁnite number of interfaces
Lemma 4.3. Assume that (γ, u) ∈ C ×P has countably many interfaces. Then there exists
(γ, uδ) ∈ C × P for suﬃciently small δ > 0, each with a ﬁnite number of interfaces, such
that uδ → u in Lp(I) for any p ∈ [1,∞) and E(γ, uδ) → E(γ, u) as δ → 0.
Proof. Let γ = (x, y) and 3δ be smaller than the minimal length of a component of {y > 0}.
We construct uδ by omitting interfaces whose distance on γ to a component boundary is
less than δ. More precisely, for a component ω = (a, b) of {y > 0} we let aδ = a + δ and
bδ = b − δ, which implies aδ < bδ and Lγ(a, aδ) = Lγ(bδ, b) = δ, and deﬁne uδ on ω to be
the continuous extension of u from (aδ, bδ) to ω, that is,

Since the number of components Nγ is ﬁnite, this can be done separately for each
component, and the composition yields a membrane (γ, uδ) with ﬁnitely many interfaces.
By construction, we have |u − uδ| ≤ 2 and y ≤ δ in (a, aδ) ∪ (bδ, b), so we ﬁnd

|u − uδ|p dµ ≤ 2p+1Nγδ2

Finally, for suﬃciently small δ there is an interface s ∈ Su ∩ Suδ that is independent of δ

the phase constraint is at most of order δ2, so it suﬃces to move s by an order of at most
M uδ dµ = mA0. This additional
change yields uδ ∈ P and does not disturb the convergence of phase ﬁelds and energy.

In virtue of Lemma 4.3 we assume from now on that (γ, u) has only ﬁnitely many inter-
faces. Then u is either continuous at points in {y = 0} or has a well-deﬁned jump. Moreover,
the minimal distance between two interfaces and from an interface to the boundary of its
component is positive. Hence, for any interface s ∈ Su there is an interval J (cid:98) {y > 0} that
contains s but no other interface, and for any component boundary point s ∈ {y = 0} \ ∂I
there is an interval J ⊂ I that contains s but no other component boundary or interface.

4.3.2 Local interface recovery

The recovery of a phase ﬁeld u with ﬁnitely many jumps follows the lines of the Modica-
√
Mortola theory for phase transitions. The main diﬀerence is the inhomogeneity due to the
area measure dµ = 2πy dt, but since u will be changed only in an interval of order
ε
around each interface, this issue is easily dealt with.
ε-energy-minimal proﬁle for a transition of uε from −1 to +1 is obtained by minimising

It is well known, see for instance [1], that in the classical one-dimensional setting the

and equality holds if and only if

Equation (4.9) admits a local solution p with initial condition p(0) = 0, because(cid:112)W (·) is

continuous. Since the constants +1 and −1 are a global super- and sub-solution of (4.9),
p can be extended to the whole real line, and due to W (p) > 0 for p ∈ (−1, +1), we
obtain p(t) → ±1 as t → ±∞. As a consequence, p(t/ε) is admissible and minimises Gε.
Furthermore, by symmetry of W we can presume −p(−t) = p(t) and need to know the
proﬁle only for t ≥ 0.
Let (γ, u) ∈ C × P have ﬁnitely many interfaces and consider s ∈ Su and J (cid:98) {y > 0}
such that J ∩ Su = {s}. For simplicity of notation we assume s = 0. Using an appropriately
scaled version of the optimal proﬁle p and a linear interpolation, we aim to construct the
recovery sequence by replacing u = sign t on J with

4.3.3 Curve approximation and recovery

To obtain a recovery sequence for the curves we have to change segments of γ = (x, y) near
interior points on the axis of revolution. Close to the axis the second principal curvature
becomes unbounded unless x(cid:48) = 0, therefore we base our construction on scaled catenoids in
order to control the mean curvature integral in the energy Eε. With the topological changes
introduced by this construction and their eﬀect on the Gauss curvature integral we deal
later by adapting the phase ﬁeld.

One issue with the above idea is that the catenoids have to make a C1-connection with
the original surface, which even after taking symmetries into account can display several
types of behaviour. For instance, the generating curve might leave the axis of revolution
turning only in one direction, zig-zagging in x-direction, or as a vertical line segment; see
Figure 4.1. In a ﬁrst step we therefore reduce the number of possible situations by showing
that a membrane can be approximated by membranes that only have vertical line segments
near the axis of revolution.

Figure 4.1: Examples of curves γ (black) near the axis of revolution and their recovery
(grey): γ turns in one-direction (1), zig-zags (2), or is vertical near the axis of revolution
(3); it is approximated in (1) and (2) by a circle segment (light grey) and a vertical line
(dark grey) as constructed in Lemma 4.5; the vertical line in (3) is recovered by a catenary
(dark grey) and a circle segment (light grey) as in Lemma 4.6.

Lemma 4.5. Let (γ, u) ∈ C × P have ﬁnitely many interfaces. Then for suﬃciently small
δ > 0 there is (γδ, uδ) ∈ C×P with ﬁnitely many interfaces such that γδ → γ in W 1,p(I; R2),
uδ → u in Lp(I) for any p ∈ [1,∞), and E(γδ, uδ) → E(γ, u) as δ → 0. Moreover, each γδ
meets the axis of revolution in vertical line segments, that is, for any s ∈ {y = 0} there are
aδ, bδ ∈ I, bδ < s < aδ such that yδ restricted to (bδ, s) and (s, aδ), respectively, is a vertical
line.

Proof. For the local construction around a point on the axis of revolution we consider the
left boundary of one component ω = (a, b) of Mγ where γ is not vertical; at right component
boundaries a mirrored version applies. For simplicity of notation and we assume a = 0,
γ(0) = (0, 0), and |γ(cid:48)| = 1 in I.
From Lemma 2.1 we know that x(cid:48)(0) = 0 and |y(cid:48)(t)| → 1 as t (cid:38) 0. It is suﬃcient to
consider the case y(cid:48)(t) → +1 as t (cid:38) 0, as the construction for y(cid:48)(t) → −1 is obtained by
traversing the former one backwards. Let J = (0, t0) ⊂ ω be an interval that contains no
interface of (γ, u) and such that y(cid:48) ≥ 1/2 in J. Since γ is not vertical near a = 0, we ﬁnd a
sequence (tδ) ⊂ J such that tδ (cid:38) 0, y(tδ) (cid:38) 0, x(cid:48)(tδ) (cid:38) 0 as δ → 0 and either x(cid:48)(tδ) > 0 or
x(cid:48)(tδ) < 0 for any δ. Again it suﬃces to consider the case x(cid:48)(tδ) > 0, as the other is dealt
with by a mirrored construction.

We aim to connect γ at t = tδ to a circle with unit speed parametrisation (kδ, lδ) given

by

kδ(t) = rδ − rδ cos

(cid:18) t − aδ

(cid:19)

and

lδ(t) = rδ sin

+ nδ

(cid:18) t − aδ

(cid:19)

rδ

with radius rδ, shifts mδ, nδ, and parameter shift aδ to be found; see Figure 4.1(1). At
t = aδ we have (k(cid:48)
δ) = (0, 1), thus the circle can be connected to a vertical line segment
provided that nδ = lδ(aδ) > 0. At t = tδ we have to satisfy the conditions

δ, l(cid:48)

k(cid:48)
δ(tδ) = x(cid:48)(tδ),
l(cid:48)
δ(tδ) = y(cid:48)(tδ),

kδ(tδ) = x(tδ),
lδ(tδ) = y(tδ)

in order to match end points and derivatives of γ and the circle. A short computation shows
that

tδ − aδ

rδ

= arctan

x(cid:48)(tδ)
y(cid:48)(tδ)

(4.11)

and

x(tδ) = rδ(1 − y(cid:48)(tδ)) + mδ,

y(tδ) = rδx(cid:48)(tδ) + nδ.

These equations determine aδ, mδ, and rδ in terms of the given tδ, γ(tδ), γ(cid:48)(tδ), and the
still free nδ; choosing nδ = y(tδ)/2 > 0, we obtain

hence aδ → 0 as δ → 0 follows.

With these circles we deﬁne a local approximation for γ by

γ(t)

γδ(t) =

(kδ(t), lδ(t))
(mδ, t + nδ − aδ)

if tδ ≤ t,
if aδ ≤ t < tδ,
if aδ − nδ ≤ t < aδ.

Here the third part is a vertical line segment of unit speed that connects (mδ, nδ) at t = aδ
with (mδ, 0) at t = aδ − nδ. Clearly, γδ belongs to W 2,2((aδ − nδ, t0); R2). Since the vertical
line and the circle segment vanish in the limit δ → 0, we have pointwise convergence of γδ
δ to γ and γ(cid:48), respectively. Moreover, the area of Mδ(aδ − nδ, t0) converges to the area
and γ(cid:48)
of M (0, t0).
On the circle segment we have |κ1,δ| = 1/rδ and thus

On the vertical segment both principal curvatures and all curvature integrals are zero.

Note in particular, that both Gauss curvature integrals are equal, because they depend only
on the tangent angle of γδ or γ at tδ and aδ − nδ or 0, respectively.

In order to ﬁt the above construction into the neighbouring components of ω, γδ and
the rest of the original curve γ have to be shifted in x and t. These shifts, however, vanish
as δ → 0 and thus do not disturb the proved convergences. Applying the above procedure
to the boundaries of each component and gluing together the resulting segments gives a
membrane (γδ, uδ) deﬁned on some interval Iδ, which converges to I as δ → 0 in the sense
that the boundary points converge.
It remains to correct the area and the phase ﬁeld constraint as well as the parameter
interval. For the area constraint we ﬁx J (cid:98) {y > 0} \ Su such that apart from the shifts γ
is unchanged in J for all small δ, x(cid:48) > 0 or x(cid:48) < 0 in J, and such that Mγ(J) is not part
of a catenoid. Such an interval exists, because otherwise γ restricted to any component of
{y > 0} would consist only of vertical lines and catenary segments, which is impossible for
a C1-curve that starts and ends on the x-axis. After an additional parameter shift of γδ we
(cid:101)γδ,α = γδ + αf , whose corresponding surface of revolution has the area
may assume that γδ(J) = γ(J) up to an x-shift. Let f ∈ C∞
c (J; R2) and consider the curve
A(cid:101)γδ,α = Aγδ + A(cid:101)γδ,α(J) − Aγ(J).
Then the requirement Aγ = A(cid:101)γδ,α is equivalent to
A(cid:101)γδ,α(J) − Aγ(J) = Aγ − Aγδ .

(4.14)

The left hand side of (4.14) equals 0 for α = 0 and depends continuously on α; it is strictly
positive for one sign of α and strictly negative for the other, since γ(J) is not a catenoid
segment and Mγ(J) not stationary for the area. The right hand side of (4.14) vanishes as
as δ → 0. Thus, gluing together (cid:101)γδ,αδ instead of γδ accounts for the area constraint at
δ → 0, hence for all suﬃciently small δ there is an αδ such that (4.14) holds and aδ → 0
the cost of violating the constant speed requirement. The latter, however, is ﬁxed by a
global reparametrisation, which also gives a membrane deﬁned on I. Since Iδ → I as δ → 0
and the perturbations from the area recovery vanishes with αδ → 0 in any function space,
these reparametrisations converge to the identity in W 2,2 and the convergences of curvature
integrals, curves, and phase ﬁelds still hold. Using the uniform bounds on γδ, γ(cid:48)
δ, and uδ
we obtain convergence of γδ in W 1,p(I; R2) and uδ in Lp(I). Since number and height of
interfaces are not aﬀected, the interface energy remains unchanged.
or introducing one or ﬁnitely many new ones at a height that vanishes with δ → 0.

The phase integral constraint is easily recovered by moving an existing interface slightly

Remark. The construction in the proof of Lemma 4.5 can also be done at ∂I. Hence,
the Lemma comprises the result that any γ ∈ C can be approximated by curves from
C ∩ W 2,2(I; R2).

The next step is to ﬁnd a recovery sequence for membranes (γ, u) as constructed in
Lemma 4.5. To this end, let s ∈ {y = 0} and ﬁx J (cid:98) I such that J ∩ ({y = 0} ∪ Su) = {s}
and γ is a vertical line in J ∩{t > s} and J ∩{t < s}. For simplicity of notation we assume
again s = 0, γ(0) = (0, 0) and |γ(cid:48)| = 1.

Proof. With sδ and tδ to be determined, we replace γ by a δ-catenary in some interval
[0, sδ) and a segment of a circle of radius 1 in [sδ, tδ), which connects the catenary and the
shifted original curve; see Figure 4.1(3). Writing

kδ(t) = sin(t − bδ) + ˆkδ

and

lδ(t) = − cos(t − bδ) + ˆlδ

for the coordinates of the circle and ﬁxing δ and sδ for the moment, we aim to determine
tδ, bδ, ˆkδ, ˆlδ, and shifts mδ, nδ such that

and a short calculation shows

that is, the catenary and circle vanish in the limit δ → 0, and therefore γδ → γ in W 1,p(J; R2)

in J and in the phase integral constraint are of the same order as above.

Since |nδ| → 0 as δ → 0, the perturbation vanishes in any function space to which γδ
belongs. The second fundamental form is still uniformly bounded in L2(J), because for all
curvatures are equal to 0. Moreover, we have inf(cid:101)J(cid:101)yδ > 0 and the error in the area constraint
small δ the perturbation is supported in a vertical line segment of γδ, where both principal
balls connected at the axis of revolution and assume that kG(u) ≡ −1. Then(cid:82)

Now it is easy to see why kG(u) has to be adapted near points on the axis of revolution,
even if u does not have a jump there. Consider for instance a surface Mγ consisting of two
kGK dµ =
kGKδ dµδ = −4π.
Since the mean curvature integral converges, the total curvature energy drops in the limit
ε → 0. Changing the phase ﬁeld such that kG(uε) = 0 compensates for this eﬀect.

In the following corollary we combine all previous constructions and apply the additional

phase ﬁeld change. This ﬁnishes the proof of the upper bound.

Corollary 4.7. Let (γ, u) ∈ C × P have ﬁnitely many interfaces and vertical line segments
near component boundaries in I. Then there are (γε, uε) ∈ Cε × Pε such that γε → γ in
W 1,1(I; R2), uε → u in L1(I) and Eε(γε, uε) → E(γ, u) as ε → 0.
Proof. Let {y = 0} ∩ I = {s1, . . . , sn} where n = Nγ − 1. We employ Lemma 4.6 and its
mirrored version successively for each sk, taking the global shifts in x-direction into account.
Since the parameter δ > 0 in Lemma 4.6 is independent of ε, we can choose it so small that
the curve replacement, apart from x-shifts and the small perturbation in Lemma 4.6, takes
place in intervals Jk,ε around sk of length at most ε and with area and phase constraint
error bounded by
ε. The result for suﬃciently small ε is a sequence (γε) that converges
to γ in W 1,p(I; R2) for any p ∈ [1,∞) and satisﬁes

We construct uε by ﬁrst replacing u around Su with the local recovery sequences from
Section 4.3.2. Additionally, we set uε = 0 in each Jk,ε and at ∂Jk,ε we make a transition to

M |K| dµ is ﬁnite. Also, (4.16) still
holds with u replaced by uε on the left hand side. Hence, we ﬁnd Eε(γε, uε) → E(γ, u) as
ε → 0.
Finally, to obtain a membrane in Cε × Pε we once more have to correct the constraints.
For the area this is done as in Lemma 4.5, while the error in the phase integral, which is
introduced by the constructions at the axis of revolution, can be corrected as in Lemma 4.4,
ε. The result is a membrane (γε, uε) that satisﬁes all conditions of Cε ×Pε
as it is of order
ε| = 1 + o(1)
except for the constant speed requirement. However, since by construction |γ(cid:48)
and the perturbation vanishes in W 1,2, the constant speed reparametrisations converge to
the identity in W 2,2(I) and the properties of (γε, uε) carry over to reparametrised curve and
phase ﬁeld.

5 Some generalisations

We conclude the paper with some extensions of Theorem 3.1. First of all, the proof is
easily adapted to non-symmetric potentials W . In this case, one considers the complete
optimal proﬁle p in Section 4.3.2 and uses the appropriate side in the connections to regions
{uε = 0} in Corollary 4.7. One may also consider potentials like W (u) = (1 − u)2 and drop
the phase integral constraint for uε. Then there is only one lipid phase, and uε is merely an
auxiliary variable that allows the recovery of topological changes at the axis of revolution
in the limit.

The constraint of prescribed area for the approximate setting can be relaxed to

0 < inf
γ∈Cε

Aγ ≤ sup
γ∈Cε

Aγ < ∞,

and the arguments for equi-coercivity and lower bound still apply. It can be incorporated
as penalty term in the energy, for instance by (Aγ − A0)2 /ε or any other scale of ε, because
we have recovered it exactly. In the same way, the phase integral constraint can be replaced
by a penalty term. Other constraints that change continuously under the convergence
proved in Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 can also be imposed, for instance on the enclosed volume
x(cid:48)y2 dt. Of course, constraints have to be compatible, so that the set of

Vγ(M ) = π(cid:82)

Mγ

admissible membranes is non-empty.
The arguments in Section 4 also apply to open surfaces of revolution generated by curves
γ = (x, y) : I → R×R>0 with prescribed boundary conditions for γ and γ(cid:48) at ∂I. The curve
length is then controlled by energy, area, and boundary conditions due to

2πLγ ≤

|H| dµ + 2π(cid:101)ϕy|∂I ,

Mγ

where(cid:101)ϕ is the tangent angle as in the proof of Lemma 2.3. Note that the boundary condition
for γ(cid:48) at ∂I is preserved as ε → 0 because y > 0 at ∂I. Furthermore, since (cid:107)(cid:101)ϕ(cid:107)∞ ≤ π/2,
it is also possible to weaken the boundary conditions to requiring a uniform L∞-bound on
y at ∂I. Such a bound can for instance be derived from uniformly bounded energy Eε + G,
where

with a constant line tension σ. Since G is continuous with respect to curve convergence in
C0, its presence does not inﬂuence the Γ-convergence. The limit energy E + G models open
lipid membranes; see for instance [20, 27, 28] for experimental observations, modelling and
numerical simulations of single-phase open membranes, respectively.
