We use density functional theory to investigate adsorption of liquid mixtures on solid surfaces modiﬁed with
end-grafted chains. The chains are modelled as freely joined spheres. The ﬂuid molecules are spherical. All
spherical species interact via the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential. The Lennard-Jones (9-3) potential describes
interactions of solvent molecules with the substrate. We study the relative excess adsorption isotherms, the
structure of surface layer and its composition. The impact of the following parameters on adsorption is dis-
cussed: the grafting density, the grafted chain length, interactions of solvent molecules with grafted chains and
with the substrate, and the presence of active groups in grafted chains. The theoretical results are consistent
with experimental observations.

1. Introduction

A great deal of research has focused on adsorption from solutions on solid surfaces modiﬁed with end-
grafted chains [1]. Understanding the adsorption equilibrium is of enormous importance for a variety of
biological and technological processes. One of them is the reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).
This technique is among the most popular methods for separation of sample components.

Various theoretical methods have been used to study the retention in chromatography with chemi-
cally bonded phases. Among these are lattice-based analytical theories [2–4], self-consistent ﬁeld methods
[5, 6], density functional theory [7, 8] and computer simulations [9–17]. The retention is driven by the dis-
tribution of solute molecules between the mobile phase and the stationary phase (alkyl chains tethered
to silica surface). The process presents theoretical challenges due to its complexity, and thus numerous
problems related to its mechanism are still unsettled.

The aim of the chromatographic analysis is to achieve the elution of all sample components in rea-
sonable time and with a satisfactory selectivity of the separation. To optimize this process, one commonly
uses a mixture of two solvents. Changing the composition of the mobile phase we change the system se-
lectivity. Much effort has been directed toward the theoretical prediction of the solution retention as a
function of the mobile phase composition [2, 18–20].

The retention strongly depends on adsorption of solvents at the stationary phase [2]. For this reason,
numerous experimental data referring to adsorption of binary solvents commonly used in chromatogra-
phy have been recently published [20–26]. However, in the literature one can ﬁnd only a few theoretical
articles connected with adsorption from solutions on chemically bonded phases. The bonded phases are
usually treated as ‘usual’ adsorbents, and the theory of adsorption from solutions on solid surfaces is
employed to interpret experimental data. The liquid part of a system is formally divided into the surface
phase and the bulk phase. The location of the dividing surface is rather arbitrary and several methods

for its estimation have been considered [13, 20]. Gritti and Gouichon [20] have used the so-called bi-
Langmuir equation for excess adsorption isotherms. They assumed that the adsorbent was composed
of two patches, one representing the surface covered with grafted chains and the second corresponding
to the bare surface of the solid. Their approach has been used to study adsorption on different bonded
phases [20, 21, 24]. This phenomenological theory does not give any insight into the structure of the chain
layer. Quite recently, the density functional theory has been used to study adsorption from solutions on
the polymer-tethered surfaces [27–30]. In this model, the penetration of the solvent molecules into the
chain layer is allowed. The densities of all species gradually change with the distance of the solid surface
and tend to their bulk values.

In this work, we present the results of the density functional study of the competitive adsorption from
binary solutions on chemically bonded phases. We show how the selected parameters affect the compo-
sition of the liquid inside the grafted chain layer. Hitherto, this problem has not been analyzed. The local
changes in the mixture composition can inﬂuence the chromatographic separation. We also consider
relative excess adsorption isotherms for the model systems investigated. We discuss the impact of such
parameters as: the grafting density, the grafted chain length and interactions of solvents with grafted
chains and with the substrate, the presence of active groups in the chains. We want to ﬁnd general trends
rather than to approximate experimental data for concrete systems. Our conclusions are consistent with
the results of experiments and computer simulations found in the literature. Short grafted chains are
used in popular stationary phases. Therefore, we concentrated on grafted oligomers.

The article is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the model and the basic aspects of
the theoretical approach. The results are presented and analyzed in section 3. Finally, we summarize the
conclusions.

2. Model and theory

We study adsorption from a binary solution on a surface modiﬁed with end-grafted chains. We em-
ploy the computational method used in our previous papers concerning this problem [27–30]. Therefore,
we discuss here only the most important aspects of the model. The method was originally proposed by
Yu and Wu [31–33]. Numerous research groups used the density functional theory to study the systems
involving either free [34–37] or grafted chains [38–42]. We treat the system as a ternary mixture in con-
tact with an impenetrable wall. The mixture consists of tethered polymers (P) and molecules of solvents
(labeled as 1 and 2). The grafted polymers (P) are chains of M freely jointed segments. The connectivity
of a given chain is enforced by the bonding potential

exp[−βVB (R)] =

M −1

Yi =1

δ(|ri +1 − ri | − σ(P))/4π(σ(P))2,

(1)

where Rk ≡ (r1, r2, . . . , rM ) is the vector specifying the positions of all segments, σ(P) is the segment diam-
eter, the symbol δ denotes the Dirac function, σ(P) is the polymer segment diameter and β−1 = kBT .

The ﬁrst segment of the chain is bonded with the surface by the potential

exph−βv (P)

s1 (z)i = C δ(z − σ(P)/2),

(2)

where z is a distance from the surface and C is a constant. The surface-binding segments are located at
the distance z = σ(P)/2 from the wall. These segments cannot leave the surface but they can move within
the x y -plane.

All of the remaining segments, i = 2, 3, . . . , M are neutral with respect to the surface and interact with

the substrate via the hard wall potential

We assume that the grafting density, ρP = NP/As, is ﬁxed where NP is the number of grafted chains

and As denotes the area of the surface.

The theory is constructed in terms of the local densities of spherical molecules, ρ(k) (k = 1, 2) and the

Using the procedure prosed by Yu and Wu [31–33] we calculate the density proﬁles of all components.
As usually, the free-energy functional is expressed as the sum F = Fid + Fhs + Fc + Fatt. The free energy of
an ideal gas, Fid, is known exactly [43]. The excess free energy following from hard-sphere interactions,
Fhs, is calculated from a modiﬁed version [32] of the fundamental measure theory of Rosenfeld [44]. The
chain connectivity contribution, Fc, follows from the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory of Wertheim [45]. A
reader can ﬁnd all necessary expressions in reference [46] [equations (7), (10) and (12), respectively]. The
attractive interactions between spherical species are expressed using mean-ﬁeld approximation

under the constraint (9). In the above, µ(k) denotes the chemical potential of the component k (k = 1, 2).
In the considered model, the density distributions vary only with the distance from the surface, ρ(k)(r) =
ρ(k)(z), k = P, 1, 2. Minimization of the thermodynamic potential leads to a set of the Euler-Lagrange
equations (equation (17) in reference [46]) which can be solved numerically. Knowing the equilibrium
distributions of all components we can calculate different quantities characterizing the adsorption and
the structure of the surface layer.

In the case of liquid mixtures, different species compete for room in the surface region, molecules of a
given component are displaced by molecules of the other component. As a consequence, the composition
of a solution considerably depends on the distance from the wall. To characterize the composition of the
solution we deﬁne the local volume fraction of the kth component (k = 1, 2)

x(k) =

ρ(k)(σ(k))3

ρ(1)(σ(1))3 + ρ(2)(σ(2))3

k = 1, 2.

(11)

Notice that x(k) is not the volume fraction in the whole system but only in the liquid.

The theory involves numerous molecular parameters. The chain segments and solvent molecules can
have different sizes. The bonded phase is characterized by the length of chains, M, and by the grafting
density, ρP. Interactions between molecules of different components are characterized by the energy
parameters ε(kl ) (k, l = P, 1, 2) while the parameter ε(k)
(k = 1, 2) describes interactions with the substrate.
Moreover, the densities of components 1 and 2 (ρ(1)

We express the energy parameters in units of thermal energy kBT . In this order we deﬁne dimension-
less energy parameters ε(kl ) = ¯ε(kl )/kBT and ε(k)

we introduce the Flory-Huggins type parameters χ(kl ) = −[ε(kl ) − 0.5(ε(kk) + ε(l l ))]. The parameter χ(12)
characterizes the nature of the bulk ﬂuid. The parameter χ(Pk) describes the compatibility of the k-th
component with respect to the chain segments.

3. Results and discussion

An adsorption equilibrium is the result of a complex interplay between two basic factors, i.e., the
attractive interactions in the systems and the repulsion in the ﬁlm built of grafted chains. The bonded
chains can act as a barrier for the solvent molecules that tend to the substrate. On the other hand, they
can provide additional ‘adsorption sites’. The adsorption process depends in a very complicated way on
the properties of all components of the system: the solid surface, grafted chains and the solvents.

The aim of our study is to show how the selected parameters affect adsorption and the composition
of the surface layer. We present here the results of the systematic model calculations carried out for
different combinations of the parameters. We try to mimic a polar adsorbent (e.g., silica gel) modiﬁed
with tethered alkyl-like chains in contact with the mixture of solvents.

As already mentioned, the system under study comprises several parameters. In order to reduce their
number to a minimum we assume that diameters of all the segments, as well as of all the free molecules
are the same, σ(P) = σ(1) = σ(2) = 1. Moreover, the calculations have been carried out by ﬁxing the fol-
lowing parameters: ε(PP) = ε(P2) = ε(11) = ε(22) = ε(12) = 1 and ε(1)
s = 1. The total bulk density of the ﬂuid is
ρ(F) = ρ(1) + ρ(2) = 0.8. Notice that χ(P2) = 0.

In this work the component 1 mimics an organic solvent that has a high aﬃnity to tethered chains but
a relatively weak aﬃnity to the polar surface. The component 2, however, can be treated either as water
or as an organic solvent, depending on the value of the parameter ε(2)
. We assumed that interactions
s
of ‘polar’ surface with the solvent 2 are considerably stronger than the interactions with the solvent 1

We begin with the discussion of the inﬂuence of the grafting density on the adsorption from solutions
on the chemically bonded phases. We consider here the surface layer built of grafted octamers (M = 8).
The relative excess adsorption isotherms obtained for different grafting densities are shown in ﬁgure 1.
The remaining parameters do not vary. In this case, the 1st solvent has only a slightly higher aﬃnity to
the grafted chains than the other component: ε(P1) = 1.2 and ε(P2) = 1. However, the interaction of the 1st
component with the substrate is much weaker than the interactions of the 2nd solvent: ε(1)

The more grafted are the chains, the more proﬁtable are the contacts between the molecules 1 and the

Our conclusions agree with the analysis of experimental data [21, 24, 26]. Gritti et al. [21] measured
the adsorption of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and alcohols from water on end-capped silica. They have
shown that an increase of the grafting density causes a rise of the relative excess adsorption of acetoni-
trile and tetrahydrofuran and shifts the adsorption azeotropic points toward the higher concentration
of organic modiﬁers. In the case of the investigated alcohols, the same trend is observed for dilute solu-
tions and the grafting densities below a certain threshold value. The analysis of the adsorption isotherms
obtained for non-end-capped C18-bonded phases leads to the same conclusions [24].

These results are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the analytical theory of adsorption
on energetically heterogeneous solid surfaces [50]. Adsorption azeotropy can be caused either by the

nonideality of the solution or by the heterogeneity of the surface. In the case of ideal solutions, as there
increases the number of active sites exhibiting a stronger aﬃnity to the molecules 1, the azeotropy point
tends to unity [50]. Gritti and Gouichon [20] have shown that the chemically bonded phases behave as
energetically heterogeneous adsorbents. They assumed that there are two kinds of adsorption sites on
the surface: grafted chains and patches of bare substrate. Within the framework of their theory, with an
increase of fraction of the surface covered with the chains, the adsorbent becomes more homogeneous
and the azeotropic point tends to unity. In the Gritti-Gouichon [20] approach, the composition of the
surface layer is assumed to be independent of the distance from the wall. There is no such a limitation in
our treatment.

Figure 2 shows the segment density proﬁles of grafted chains for different grafting densities. The pro-
ﬁles have a typical liquid-like structure with peaks corresponding to successive layers of chain segments
near the wall. In the outer region of the bonded phase, the chain density smoothly decreases to zero. The
height of the chain layer considerably increases with an increase of the grafting density. The repulsive
forces between the chains enforce them to stretch in the direction perpendicular to the wall.

The density proﬁles of the solution components presented in ﬁgure 3 provide data on the solvent
distribution in the surface layer. The arrows show the brush edges for different grafting densities. The
results have been obtained for the average concentration of the 1st component, x(1)
= 0.35. In the consid-
b
ered system, both solvents have relatively high aﬃnity to the grafted chains, while the grafting density is
rather low. Therefore, all ﬂuid molecules penetrate the chain layer. There are several peaks at the local
density proﬁles of both components. The positions of these peaks correspond to the maxima observed at
the density proﬁles of the chains. The solvent molecules ‘stick’ to the grafted chains. Due to strong inter-
actions with the solid surface, the molecules 2 accumulate on the wall and there is a signiﬁcant peak near
the substrate. The structure of the middle part of the surface layer considerably depends on the grafting
density. With an increasing number of grafting chains, the density of the component 1, ρ(1), increases
while the density of the other solvent decreases. In the outer region of the surface layer, the component
densities gradually tends to their bulk values. Note that the molecules 1 accumulate not only within the
brush but also atop the bonded phase.

It is instructive to analyze the local composition of the surface layer. The local mole fractions of liquid
mixture are depicted in ﬁgure 4 for x(1)
= 0.9 (b). For a given value of the grafting

erably lower (greater) than in the bulk phase. In the region 1.5 < z < 6.5, however, the inverse relation is
found, the mole fraction of the 1st (2nd) component is greater (smaller) than its mole fraction in the bulk
solution. There is a signiﬁcant enrichment of the ‘organic’ solvent 1 within the bonded phase. With an
increase of the grafting density, the mole fraction x(1) increases (x(2) decreases). These effects are much

The remaining parameters are the same as those in ﬁgure 1. Under these conditions, the relative excess
adsorption N e
1 is greater for longer grafted chains. On the surface covered by short chains (M = 4), the
2nd component is adsorbed preferentially in the whole concentration region (N e
< 0). For longer chains,
1
adsorption of the 1st solvent is favored at lower mole fractions, x(1)
b . An increase of the number of chain
segments causes a rise of a proﬁtable contact between the molecules 1 and the grafted chains, and thus
the relative excess adsorption N e
1 increases. The same relation has been found for adsorption of organic
solvents from aqueous solutions on the bonded phases with different chain lengths attached to silica
[22, 23]. For denser brushes and very long polymers, an impact of chain lengths weakens [22].

of the 1st component increases for longer grafted chains. Obviously, the opposite is observed for the mole
fraction x(2)

Now we turn to the effects of interactions with the whole adsorbing material, i.e., with the substrate
and with the grafted chains. Let us consider the role of interactions with the solid surface. In ﬁgure 6 (a),
the relative excess isotherms are plotted for a ﬁxed value of energy parameter ε(1)
s = 1 and for three
values of the energy parameter ε(2)
s = 5, 10, 15. We moderate the relative solvent aﬃnity by changing the
solvent 2. The relative excess adsorption isotherm reﬂects the competition in accumulation of compo-
nents 1 and 2 within the surface layer. The relative aﬃnity of the 1st component to the whole adsorbing
material increases as the difference ∆ = ε(1)
increases. Indeed, one sees that the preferential adsorp-
tion of the component 1 is greater for lower values of the parameter ε(2)
. At the same time, the azeotropic
s
point shifts to unity, namely x(1)
s = 10. Such a behavior is pre-

dicted by the simple theories of adsorption form solutions [50]. These conclusions are in an agreement
with the experimental observations [24].

The proﬁles of the mixture composition are plotted in ﬁgure 6 (b) for x(2)

accumulate at the surface, and the mole fraction x(2) decreases with an increase of the parameter ε(2)
s
(dashed lines). On the contrary, the mole fraction of the 1st component is considerably lower for higher
values of ε(2)
s

. These effects are signiﬁcant only in the immediate proximity to the wall.

Adsorption of the 1st component can be also altered by changing the parameter ε(P1) [see ﬁgure 7 (a)].
The relative aﬃnity of the components to the chains is well quantiﬁed by the difference ∆P = ε(P1) − ε(P2).
The energy parameter ε(P2) = 1. An increase of the parameter ε(P1) leads to a considerable rise of the
preferential adsorption of the 1st component. The attractive interactions of the molecules 1 with segments
of the grafted chains markedly affect the composition of the middle and the outer parts of the surface
region. This is clearly demonstrated in ﬁgure 7 (b).

Adsorptive properties of the bonded phases can be modelled by the use of the grafted chains with
active groups. Such chains are copolymers containing a few segments which very strongly attract ﬂuid
molecules. We have carried out the calculations using the method described in reference [30]. We con-
sider the grafted chains built of M A segments A and MB segments B (M A + MB = M). The segments
A mimic methylene groups in alkyl chains, while the segments B correspond to the functional (active)
group. Within the framework of the model, the parameters characterizing the interactions of the kth
component with segments A and B are different (ε(Ak) , ε(B k)). Here we show the results for the chains
that contain MB = 2 segments of the B-type. These segments can be placed at consecutive positions of
the backbone: is and is+1. The given type of chains is labeled as Bisi s+1. We consider two positions of the
functional group: in the close proximity to the wall (as the 3rd and 4th segments, B34) and at the chain
end (B78). The ﬁrst type of the grafted chains corresponds to polar embedded stationary phases which
are often used in RPLC. The latter mimics stationary phases with functionalized terminal groups of the
ligands [51]. We have focused only on the interactions of solvents with different segments. Therefore, we

have assumed that both components are inert with respect to the wall. In the considered case, aﬃnity of
the solvent 1 to the segments B is much larger than the aﬃnity to the ‘usual’ segments A, ε(A1) = ε(P1) = 1.2
and ε(B 1) = 3. Moreover, ε(AB ) = ε(PP) = 1 (χ(AB ) = 0). Interactions of the 2nd solvent with all segments are
weaker, ε(A2) = ε(B 2) = ε(P2) = 1.

Figure 8 illustrates the effect of the position of functional groups in grafted chains on the relative
excess adsorption isotherms and the composition of the surface layer. The shapes of the isotherm are
typical of a strong preferential adsorption of the 1st component. The position of the functional group
affects the relative excess adsorption for x(1)
> 0.1. Adsorption is higher for terminal functional groups.
b
In panel b, the local mole fractions of the components are shown for x(1)
= 0.35. There is a considerable
b
enrichment of the component 1 near the active groups. The maximum in x(1)-proﬁle is shifted toward the
outer part of the surface layer for B78.

It follows from the above discussion that the adsorption of liquid mixtures on chemically bonded
phases and the composition of the surface layers depend on the relations between the parameters char-
acterizing the system. The model is very sensitive to the choice of a particular set of the parameters.
Changing these parameters one can simulate various systems.

Finally, we consider the problem of ‘a range of the surface layer’. In chromatographic applications,
a delimitation between the surface and bulk phases is necessary. The retention factor is proportional to
the volume of the stationary (surface) phase. Moreover, the calculation of real adsorption (the number of
molecules in the surface phase) requires a deﬁnition of the boundary of the adsorbed phase. In interface
science, the Gibbs dividing surface (GDS) is introduced to deﬁne the volumes of both phases. The choice
of the position of the Gibbs dividing surface is arbitrary [20]. When the density proﬁles are known, the
GDS is usually deﬁned via the standard equal area construction [52]. In analytical theories, the position
of GDS is chosen using the procedure that ensures the thermodynamic consistency of the results [20].
Unfortunately, the problem is not trivial.

Various quantities can be treated as a measure of the thickness of the surface (stationary) phase. For
example, one can use characteristics of the chain layer: (i) the effective height of the grafted layer, heff
(the distance from the wall at which the segment density of the chains decreases to zero), and (ii) the
average brush height calculated from the following equation[53, 54]

h = 2R dzzρ(P)

The height of the polymer brush can quite well approximate the surface phase boundary since the
partitioning is a dominant mechanism of the sorption.[5] On the other hand, when adsorption plays a

signiﬁcant role in the process, the ﬂuid density proﬁles should be analyzed to estimate: (i) the location of
the GDS [20] or (ii) the ‘effective’ surface phase boundary. The latter is the maximum distance, z, above
which the liquid is considered to be identical to the bulk solution [8].

In all investigated systems, the bonded phases are highly inhomogeneous. One can divide the sur-
face layer into three parts: (i) the interfacial region located near the wall, (ii) the interface between the
brush and the bulk solution, and (iii) the middle (‘bulk’) part of the bonded phase. For relatively short
grafted chains, the volume of the ‘bulk’ stationary phase is comparable with the volumes of the interfa-
cial regions. There is no well-pronounced ﬂat part in the segment density proﬁles (cf. ﬁgure 1) that could
be treated as the ‘bulk’ bonded phase. Therefore, the standard method for the location of the GDS [52]
cannot be suﬃciently precise. We assume that the boundary is located at the distance at which the com-
position of the adsorbed liquid becomes identical with the bulk solution (with a precision of 1 percent
of x(1)

b ).
Figure 9 shows how the grafting density affects the average height of the chain layer h [equation (13)],
the ‘effective’ height of polymer brush, heff, and the ‘effective’ thickness of the surface layer, hx . All the
‘thicknesses’ increase as the grafting density increases. The dependence of the average brush height on
the grafting density, h vs ρP, has been the subject of numerous studies [54, 55]. The ‘effective’ thickness
of the brush is considerably greater than the average height, heff > h and hx > h. As one can expected,
the true adsorbed phase can be more expanded due to the secondary adsorption on the brush. Indeed,
for ρP > 0.08, the ‘effective’ thickness of the surface phase hx is considerably higher than heff. This just
reﬂects a competitive adsorption in the region above the chain layer. However, at low surface coverages,
the opposite relation is found, hx < heff. In the outer region of the brush, the density of chain segments
is too low to change the liquid composition. After penetration of the solution into the chain layer, the
composition starts to vary. The problem of the delimitation between surface and bulk phases requires a
further analysis.

The thickness of the surface layer varies with the change of the bulk solution. However, these effects

are not very signiﬁcant [55].

4. Conclusions

We have performed the density functional calculations to study the adsorption from binary solutions
on the chemically bonded phases. We have assumed that solvent molecules are spherical. The segments
and the solvent molecules interact via Lennard-Jones (12–6) potential. All chain segments but the bonding
segment are inert with respect to the substrate. The solvent molecules interacts with the solid surface via
Lennard-Jones (9–3) potential or by the hard-wall potential.

We have systematically analyzed the effect of the selected factors on the composition of the surface
layer. In the model, both solvents are capable of penetrating the brush. Solvent molecules ‘stick’ to the
chains. Therefore, the solvent density proﬁles reﬂect the structure of the brush. We have assumed that
the solvent 1 exhibits high aﬃnity to the grafted chains (ε(P1) > ε(P1)), while the solvent 2 very strongly
interacts with the substrate (ε(1)
). Molecules of different components compete for room inside the
brush. As a consequence, the composition of the liquid mixture in the surface region changes with the
distance from the wall. A considerable enrichment of the 1st component was observed in the middle and
in the outer parts of the surface region. On the contrary, close to the substrate, high concentration of the
2nd component was found.

We have discussed the effect of the system parameters on the proﬁles of local mole fractions of the
components. We have studied the impact of the following parameters: the grafting density, the grafted
chain length, interactions of solvent molecules with grafted chains and the substrate and the presence of
active groups in the chains. We have shown that the mole fraction of the 1st component increases as the
grafting density increases. The same effect is observed as the parameter ε(P1) rises or the adsorption en-
ergy of the 2nd component, ε(2)
, decreases. The impact of the difference in interactions with the substrate
s
is limited to its proximity while the effects of interactions with grafted chains are well pronounced al-
most in the whole surface layer. An increase of the local mole fraction x(1) is also found for longer grafted
chains. The composition of the liquid mixture markedly changes near the active groups in the chains.

The local mole fractions of the liquid components inside the bonded phase cannot be experimentally
measured. However, this is possible for the relative adsorption isotherms. Therefore, we have presented
the relative adsorption isotherms for the model systems considered. We have qualitatively compared
our results with experimental isotherms. The theory well predicts general trends observed in experi-
ments [20–26].

We have also analyzed the problem of the delimitation between the surface phase and the bulk phase.
The thickness of the surface phase is necessary for calculating the retention factors in chromatography.
We have compared three methods for the estimation of the thickness of the surface phase. The quantities
characterizing the brush, namely, the average brush height, h [53] or the effective brush thickness (the
location of the brush edge), heff, can be effectively used since the solvent molecules deeply penetrate the
chain layer and do not accumulate ‘on the brush’. However, when the composition of the liquid mixture
above the chain layer differs from that in the bulk solution, the effective surface layer thickness, hx
should be estimated.

Our results conﬁrmed that the density functional theory provides a ﬂexible and effective tool for
modelling the adsorption from binary solutions on the surfaces modiﬁed with grafted chains. The study
of adsorption from binary solutions on the chemically bonded phase can be a starting point for the the-
oretical prediction of the solute retention from mixed mobile phases. The extension of this approach is
straightforward. Such a model system would contain at least four components: the bonded chains and
three free components, i.e., two solvents and a solute. More realistic models would be used to investigate
chromatographic systems, e.g., the models involving associative and electrostatic interactions between
components [36, 38].

твердого тiла, яка модифiкована ланцюжками. Ланцюжки моделюються як вiльно з’єднанi сфери. Моле-
кули рiдини є сферичними. Взаємодiя усiх типiв сфер описується потенцiалрм Ленарда-Джонса (12-6). По-
тенцiал типу (9-3) описує взаємодiю молекул розчинника з пiдкладкою. Дослiджено iзотерми надлишко-
вої адсорбцiї, структуру поверхневого шару i його склад. Описано вплив густини i довжини ланцюжкiв,
взаємодiї молекул розчинника з ланцюжками i з пiдкладкою на адсорбцiю. Розглянуто також вплив при-
сутностi активних груп у ланцюжках. Теоретичнi результати узгоджуються з експериментальними спосте-
реженнями.
