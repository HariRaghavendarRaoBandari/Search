An optical chopper periodically interrupts a classical light beam. We propose a realizable quan-
tum version of the optical chopper, where the time-periodic driving of the light-matter coupling
is achieved through a nonlinear three wave mixing element. We theoretically investigate how our
scheme can be used for the controllable shaping of few photon light. Using Floquet dynamics,
we ﬁnd strong periodic modulations of the transmission and reﬂection envelopes in the scattered
few-photon pulses, including photon compression and blockade, as well as dramatic changes in the
quantum light statistics. Our theoretical analysis allows us to explain these non-trivial phenomena
as arising from non-adiabatic memory eﬀects.

Introduction.— Optical choppers and shutters [1] are
ubiquitous optical
for
their application in the ﬁrst non-astronomical speed of
light measurements by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849 [2], and
used today for e.g. speed or rotation measurements, light
exposure control, and oﬀ-frequency noise ﬁltering. The
prototypical chopper uses a rotating wheel with holes
that periodically block the incident light beam, with the
hole radius to beam width ratio controlling the waveform
of the chopped light [3].

Recent advances in nanophotonic technologies allow
for a controllable manipulation of
light-matter cou-
plings [4], and we show in this Letter, how a time-periodic
coupling can be designed and used to implement an op-
tical chopper down to the quantum single-photon level
– a quantum chopper. The future applications of quan-
tum choppers might be as diverse as those of its classi-
cal counterpart, especially, due to the increasing interest
in periodiccaly driven open or closed quantum systems.
Theoretically, various eﬀective Floquet models [5] already
describe photon-assisted tunneling in quantum wells and
the dynamics of quantum open systems. Experimentally,
electron-spin and nuclear magnetic-spin resonances ac-
cess the time-evolution of spinful particles placed time-
dependent oscillating magnetic ﬁelds. In quantum infor-
mation dynamical decoupling schemes [6–10] and their
reﬁnements [11, 12], periodic sequences of fast and strong
symmetrizing pulses are used to reduce some parts of a
system-bath interaction, which cause decoherence. The
Floquet systems also naturally appear in digital quantum
computation schemes [13], and in recent years periodic
perturbations have been used as a ﬂexible experimental
tool to engineer new, synthetic phases of matter not ac-
cessible in equilibrium systems [14–25].

Our quantum chopper scheme, shown in Fig. 1, uses
the Josephson ring modulator (JRM) [26] which is based
on the Josephson junction Wheatstone bridge. While the
JRM has been originally conceived as a parametric con-
verter and afterwards employed [27] as a tool to generate
a chemical potential for photons, we suggest to use it as

FIG. 1: A microwave variant of the quantum chopper scheme.
The system consists of the transmon qubit (right part) cou-
pled to the transmission line (left part) via a nonlinear ele-
ment — the Josephson ring modulator (central part). The
coupling between the qubit and the transmission line is mod-
ulated by the time-dependent current Ip(t).

a nonlinear element that controls a time-dependent cou-
pling between a transmission line and a qubit. The role
of the JRM is to produce an analogue of the parametric
down conversion, such that one of the modes becomes
classical and can be driven periodically by an external
classical current. We describe the system in Fig. 1 in
terms of scattering of microwave photons, which propa-
gate in the transmission line, from the qubit.

We develop a general multi-photon Floquet scattering
formalism for time-periodic light-matter couplings and
apply it to describe the quantum properties of light, like
transmittance, reﬂectance, ﬁrst- and second-order coher-
ences. This allows us to demonstrate the quantum chop-
per as a tool for pulse shaping of individual photons.

We ﬁnd that for weakly coherent incident pulses a
time-periodic modulation of the coupling between pho-
tons and the cavity causes considerable modiﬁcations to
envelopes of the scattered photons. In some driving pro-
tocols, the ﬁeld can be even locally quenched, with the

envelope featuring nodes, which is a quantum analogue
of the classical light chopping. We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
eﬀect of the modulation on the photon’s statistics. Thus,
for reﬂected photons on resonance we observe alternat-
ing patterns of bunching and antibunching which peri-
odically change in time – this contrasts with the purely
antibunching behavior in the case of constant coupling.
Setup.— We propose a scheme for realizing quantum
optical chopping (shown in Fig. 1) consisting of a trans-
mission line with linear dispersion of propagating mi-
crowave photons, a parametric coupler, and a transmon
qubit. Following [26] we introduce the node ﬂux vari-

The mode ΦZ is coupled to the AC current source

Floquet scattering formalism.— An extension of the
scattering formalism for time-periodic Hamiltonians was
originally proposed in Ref. [29] for the calculation of
above-threshold-ionization spectra. Remarkably, it of-
fered an eﬀectively time-independent description of the
quasistationay limit in terms of the Floquet states. Later,
similar scattering approaches have been developed for
single-particle scattering [30, 31] and many body scat-
tering of non-interacting particles [32, 33]. One recent
study [34] dwells on the calculation of inelastic scatter-
ing rates in driven interacting systems.

We apply these general results to two coupling modu-
lation protocols: 1) “on-oﬀ” g(t) = g0(1 + cos Ωt); and
2) “sign change” g(t) = g0 cos Ωt. In the “on-oﬀ” pro-
tocol the coupling strength is periodically quenched to
zero [Fig. 2(a)], while in the “sign change” protocol, the
sign of g(t) changes after crossing zero [Fig. 2(c)]. The
major diﬀerence between the two protocols is that the
former yields a 2π-periodic modulation of a ﬁeld’s ampli-
tude [Fig. 2(b)], while the latter yields a π-periodic one
[Fig. 2(d)].

For a time independent interaction, a single photon
on resonance (δ = 0) is fully reﬂected (r = −1), re-
gardless the value of the coupling strength. Should the
δ2 + Γ2(t) be ful-
adiabaticity condition | ˙g(t)/g(t)| (cid:28)
ﬁlled at every time t for a time periodic interaction, we
would expect the reﬂection amplitude r(t) to follow Γ(t)

(cid:112)

(a)(b)(c)(d)instantaneously, also showing (almost) full reﬂection in
the resonant case (the small fraction | ˙g(t)/(g(t)Γ(t))|2
of the transmitted photon’s probability density can be
obtained from the ﬁrst adiabatic correction). However,
the adiabaticity condition is strongly violated for the
two protocols. Moreover, at certain time instants the
coupling strength in both of them is quenched, imply-
ing a momentary decoupling of microwave photons from
the cavity and hence full transmission at these time in-
stants. Since we are dealing with an open quantum sys-
tem, this qualitative picture becomes even more com-
plicated due to memory eﬀects, and the non-adiabatic
behavior can be explained as a sum over histories. Each
history has the photon entering the cavity at some ini-
tial time, τi, and leaving at some later time, τf , with
an amplitude g(τi)g(τf ), and a weight determined by
the decay probability of the photonic state in the cav-
ity, exp(−
Γ(τ )dτ ). The reﬂection coeﬃcient at τf ,
given by the sum over initial times τi, is highly inﬂu-
enced by the evolution within a memory window set by
the decay rate of the cavity.

(cid:82) τf

τi

In the “on-oﬀ” protocol the memory window is largest
for ﬁnal times after the Ωτc = −π node, meaning that
the photon remains longer in the cavity and is released
shortly after when the coupling strength is suﬃciently
increased, producing a spike in the reﬂection coeﬃcient
that overshoots unity [Fig. 2(b)]. In the “sign change”
protocol memory eﬀects create an additional node, that
is absent in g(t), close to Ωτc = −π/2 for slow drive and
moving towards τc = 0 for faster drives [Fig. 2(d)]. For
times shortly after the −π/2 node of g(t) the memory
window includes histories with amplitudes of opposite
signs, and their competition creates this additional node.
All this shows how diﬀerent protocols not only chop the
wavepacket of the incoming photon, but also signiﬁcantly
alter its form.

The resulting envelopes strongly depend on the nor-
malized frequency β = Ω/Γ(0), where Γ(0) is the zeroth
harmonic of Γ(t). For the fast drive β (cid:29) 1, we obtain
A(τc) ≈ − 2
3 (1 + cos Ωτc) in the “on-oﬀ” protocol, which
means that the reﬂected pulse follows g(τc), not Γ(τc);
and A(τc) ≈ − 1
β sin 2Ωτc following Γ(0)τc − f1(τc) in the
“sign change” protocol. In the second case, A(τc) is neg-
ligibly small, so that we have (almost) full transmission
despite the resonance — this eﬀect is in sharp contrast
to its non-driven counterpart. For the slow drive β (cid:28) 1,
the adiabaticity condition is fulﬁlled at least within some
range around τc = 0, and this accounts for the formation
of the plateau A(τc) ≈ −1, resembling full reﬂection in
the non-driven resonant case.

The second order coherences manifest nonlinear ef-
fects quantiﬁed by the value of U . They depend on the
central time τc and the delay time τd > 0, being pe-
riodic in τc and aperiodic in τd.

cols. In the “on-oﬀ” protocol, the fast drive only induces
small oscillations in the correlation function around the
non-driven results [28].
In contrast, the “sign change”
protocol induces huge bunching eﬀects due to the ad-
ditional node in the single-photon reﬂection, as can be
clearly seen in Fig. 3(a). We also ﬁnd periodic oscillations
between strong bunching (red areas) and anti-bunching
(blue areas) away from Ωτc = 0 and Ωτc = ±π. This is a
dramatic change in statistical properties of the reﬂected
light due to the time dependence of g(t) as compared to
the case of constant g, where g(2)
is monotonously anti-
ll
bunched. For a moderate drive, β = 1, all oscillatory ef-
fects in the “sign change” protocol die out for delay times
longer than a single drive period, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
Summary.— We have proposed the quantum analogue
of an optical chopper, operating at a few-photon level
and realizable by a time-periodic modulation of the light-
matter coupling strength. We have developed an exact
Floquet scattering approach based on diagrammatic scat-
tering theory and applied it to quantitatively describe
scattering of microwave photons from the transmon qubit
in two driving protocols of the coupling: “on-oﬀ” and
“sign change”. In both of them we have observed inter-
esting non-adiabatic memory eﬀects arising due to the
driving.
In particular, the “on-oﬀ” protocol produces
periodic compressions of the photon’s wavepacket, while
the “sign change” protocol gives rise to the additional
nodes in the envelope at which the ﬁeld is completely

g(2)llforβ=10(a)(b)g(2)llforβ=1quenched. Thus, in both cases the optical chopping is re-
alized at the quantum single-photon level. In addition, in
the “sign change” protocol we ﬁnd dramatic changes in
statistical properties of the reﬂected ﬁeld showing up as
strong bunching peaks in the g(2) function that are inter-
woven with periodically alternating areas of antibunch-
ing and moderate bunching — features that are in sharp
contrast to their non-driven counterparts. Our ﬁndings
can be used in few-photon pulse manipulation, the de-
sign of photonic statistics at will and, as a consequence,
in quantum information processing.

the terms containing the decoupled modes Φl and Φr].

DETAILS OF THE FLOQUET SCATTERING FORMALISM

Let us consider an arbitrary Hamiltonian

H = H0 + V (t),

(S2)

where the interaction V (t) has a periodic time dependence V (t) = V (t + T ), and therefore can be expressed by the
Fourier series

(S3)

A particular case is given by V (t) = g(t)v0, where g(t) is a time-dependent coupling strength.

To obtain a scattering operator we start from an equation for the evolution operator in the interaction picture

where Vint(t) = eiH0tV (t)e−iH0t. Taking the limit t0 → −∞ we transform (S4) into the integral form

where Θ(m

the “on-oﬀ” protocol at fast driving, β = 10. The g(2)
correlation for the corresponding non-driven system with
a decay rate set to Γ(0) are shown as dashed lines, and the
(uninteresting) correlations for the driven system slightly
oscillate around the non-driven antibunching curves.

for the “sign change” protocol at fast driving, β = 10,
for various Kerr nonlinearities U . The alternating bunch-
ing and anti-bunching is evident, with the correlations
increasing with increasing U .

For completeness we show additional numerical results for the g(2) correlation function. The “on-oﬀ” case only
induces small oscillations on top of the non-driven correlations, as can be seen from the g(2)
ll (τc = 0, τd) plot shown in
Fig. S1. For comparison we also plot the correlation function for the non-driven system ﬁxing the decay rate to the
time-averaged value of the driving protocol.

For clarity Fig. S2 showcase g(2)

of the Kerr nonlinearity, U , hence presenting a line-cut of Fig. 3(a) from the main text.

ll (Ωτc = −π/2, τd) for the “sign change” protocol at fast driving for various values
The photon compression by the “on-oﬀ” driving introduces nodes in the transmission and produces, similarly to
the ﬁeld quench eﬀects in the reﬂected light for the “sign change” protocol, strong bunching in the transmitted light
captured by g(2)
rr . This picture is veriﬁed by a numerical calculation of the correlation function for fast drive, β = 10,
and nonlinearity, |U| = 2Γ(0) as shown in Fig. S3.
