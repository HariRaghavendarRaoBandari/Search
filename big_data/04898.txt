A bosonic Josephson junction is a prototype system to investigate how (if at all) an isolated quan-
tum system driven out of equilibrium reaches a steady and possibly thermalized state for long times.
The relaxation happens because of the quasiparticle excitations induced by the initial quenching of
the Josephson coupling. We describe such a coupled BEC and incoherent excitations system in terms
of the quantum kinetic equations and analyse in detail system’s nonequilibrium dynamics. We ﬁnd,
interestingly, that the nonequilibrium dynamics is governed by three diﬀerent time scales. After
an initial period τc of undamped Josephson oscillations, quasiparticles are created in an avalanche
manner due to a dynamically generated parametric resonance between the Josephson frequency
and the quasiparticle excitation energies. This leads to a fast depletion as well as damping of the
BEC amplitude. When the ﬁnal number of quasiparticles, allowed by total energy conservation, is
reached, however, the quasiparticle system eﬀectively decouples from the BEC oscillations (freeze-
out time of the BEC τf ), and the total quasiparticle number becomes nearly conserved. Under
this approximate conservation law the system enters into a quasi-hydrodynamical regime which is
characterized by a slow, exponential relaxation of the quasiparticle system into a thermalized state
with thermalization time τth. We prove this behavior by a detailed Fourier analysis of the oscillatory
behavior in the diﬀerent time regimes.

Experimental realisation of fully controllable systems
of ultra cold gases relaunched interest in fundamental
non-equilibrium problems, such as for example, relax-
ation and eventual thermalization of ﬁnite, isolated quan-
tum systems [1, 2].
It seems that thermalization, if it
happens, strongly depends on the system, and it is diﬃ-
cult to ﬁnd a unique answer to the problem. For exam-
ple, some low-dimensional systems thermalise very slowly
and prior to thermalisation enter a so-called prethermal-
ization regime, which became a topic of research by it-
self (see [3] and references therein). A bosonic Joseph-
son junction created by loading a Bose-Einstein conden-
sate (BEC) into a double-well trap [4–6], can serve as
a paradigm for investigating of how a nonequilibrium
quantum system relaxes and reaches thermal state, if at
all. Time scales involved in the quasiparticle creation,
the damping of the BEC oscillations and the eventual
thermalisation of the quasiparticles in more than one-
dimensional traps, where a true BEC exists, have been
obscure.
It is also clear that quasiparticle non-elastic
collisions responsible for the system relaxation require a
many-body ﬁeld theoretical approach and are not cap-
tured by semiclassical descriptions [6], as also numerical
studies indicate [7].

In this paper we study the nonequilibrium dynamics
of the coupled BEC and incoherent excitations in de-
tail. We derive the quantum kinetic equations using the

∗Email: anna.posazhennikova@rhul.ac.uk
†Email: kroha@th.physik.uni-bonn.de

Bogoliubov-Keldysh Green’s function technique [8, 9] in
the time domain and representing the Hamiltonian in
the discrete eigenbasis of the ﬁnite-size trap potential.
Whereas the BECs in the double well are treated as clas-
sical amplitudes, the full quantum dynamics due to in-
elastic collisions of the incoherent excitations is taken into
account.

We ﬁnd rich dynamics governed by three main time
scales. First of all, although we quench the Josephson
coupling at the initial time J(t) = Jθ(t), quasiparticles
do not get excited simultaneously, but only after a cer-
tain time τc of multiple undamped Josephson oscillations,
and in an avalanche-like, inﬂationary way [10, 11]. This
results in a broad spectrum of the condensate oscilla-
tions which roughly corresponds to the spectrum of in-
coherent excitations in this regime. We attribute this
curious behaviour to a dynamically generated paramet-
ric resonance between the Josephson frequency and the
quasiparticle excitation energies. This "coupling" regime
lasts till τf > τc when eﬀective decoupling of condensate
modes and quasiparticles happens. The second energy
scale τf comes into play because the number of excited
quasiparticles is restricted from above due to the total en-
ergy conservation. Whenever the ﬁnal number is reached,
the crossover to the oﬀ-resonant regime takes place, BEC
gets "frozen-out" and for t > τf the total quasiparticle
number is eﬀectively conserved. The new regime can be
approximated as hydrodynamic and is charaterized by
a progressive exponential relaxation of the quasiparticle
system towards a thermalized state. The third time-scale
τth >> τf is the thermalization time in this regime.

We develop a semi-analytical ﬁeld theoretical approach
to the problem, applicable to any dimensionality and
number of particles.
In our approach the condensate
is described within a semiclassical two-mode approxi-
mation [12], while quasi-particle contributions are de-
scribed quantum-mechanically [10, 11]. We consider a
BEC conﬁned in a double-well potential with an initial
population imbalance between the right and the left well:
z(0) = N1(0)−N2(0)
N1(0)+N2(0) 6= 0 (N1,2(t) is the number of parti-
cles in the left (right) well). This system is known to
exhibit Josephson oscillations [4, 5, 12]. It is most gen-
erally described by the standard Hamiltonian

where ˆΨ(r, t) is a bosonic ﬁeld operator, and we as-
sumed a contact interaction between the bosons with
g = 4πas/m (as is the s-wave scattering length). Vext
is the external double-well trapping potential. To obtain
an eﬀective Hamitonian for our problem, we assume that
our double well potential has discrete eigenstates and ex-
pand the ﬁeld operator ˆΨ(r, t) in terms of a complete
basis B = {ϕ−, ϕ+, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . ϕM } of the exact single-
particle eigenstates of Vext(r, t > 0) after the coupling

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (2) constitute the usual two-
mode approximation for a condensate in a double well
[12], i.e. φ1 and φ2 are symmetric and antisymmetric
combinations of ϕ− and ϕ+. The Bogoliubov substitu-
tion neglects phase ﬂuctuations in the ground states of
each of the potential wells, while the full quantum dy-
namics is taken into account for the excited states, ϕn,
n = 1, 2, . . . , M . This is justiﬁed when the BEC particle
numbers are suﬃciently large, Nα ≫ 1, e.g., for the ex-
periments [4]. In the numerical evaluations we will limit
the number of levels which can be occupied by the quasi-

the thick lines on top of the oscillating ones). Here FG

is the upper left component of the statistical Green’s
function Fmm in the Bogoliubov space (see Supplemen-
tary Material). All nm-s and nqp are normalised by the
total particle number Ntot = N1(0) + N2(0). One can
readily see the quasi saturation of quasiparticle occupa-
tion numbers for t >> τc.

In order to better understand this behaviour and to
extract the second time scale, we plot the ln |navg(t) −
navg(∞)|,
ln |∆n(t)|, and ln |z(t)| versus dimensionless
time Jt (respectively upper, middle and lower panels
in Fig. 2). navg is the averaged ntot, and navg(10) ≈
navg(∞) is the saturation value of ntot, and ∆n(t) =
ntot(t) − navg(∞). By making linear ﬁts, one can see
that exponential decay is described by two diﬀerent decay
rates. The change in decay happens at τf , the "freezing-
out" time scale, which marks the onset of the quasiparti-
cle saturation phase where incoherent excitations become
decoupled from the coherent condensation modes. Ther-
malization time τth >> τf is the inverse decay rate in
the decoupled, hydrodynamic-like regime.

From spectral and statistical functions of the quasipar-
ticles we can now analyse the spectra of our system. We

Fig. 3 we plot the frequency dependent absolute val-
ues of |AG(ω, t+)| ≡ |A(ω)| and |FG(ω, t+)| ≡ |F(ω)| for
t+ = 9.01, i.e. for relatively large times when the system
is close to the equilibrium state. As expected the Foureir-
transformed spectral and statistical functions exhibit the
ﬁve peaks which can be approximated by Lorentzians,
shown in Fig. 3 upper and middle panels. The inset
shows the corresponding weights of the ﬁve Lorentzian
peaks w-s.
It is constructive to compare these spectra
with the Fourier transform of the condensate particle im-
balance (Fig. 3, lower panel). The red curve shows the
Fourier transformed z(t) in the strongly-coupled regime,
i.e.
for t . τf . Surprisingly, it exhibits sizeable peaks
roughly at energy positions of the ﬁve quasiparticle lev-
els maked by vertical lines. This is a strong indication of
the dynamically generated parametric resonance which
governs this regime (τc . t . τf ).

In the quasi-hydrodynamic regime (t > τf ) the be-
haviour is strikingly dissimilar. The condensate in this
regime is expected to perform regular Josephson oscil-

which it indeed does. The diﬀerence, however, is that
the Josephson coupling J is now strongly renormalized
by the quasiparticle assisted tunnelling J ′ and is pro-
portional to the total quasiparticle number ntot. The
renormalized Josephson frequency for the ﬁnal state can

be estimated as ωJ∞ ≈ 2Jef fp1 + uJ/(2Jef f ), where

Jef f = J + ntotJ ′. We see that this frequency is indeed
very close to the frequency of Josephson oscillations in
the uncoupled regime (see the location of the blue peak
in Fig. 3 lower panel), though not exactly equal to it be-
cause the condensates are not completely decoupled and
the Josephson frequency is still inﬂuenced by the slower
Rabi oscillations. Since the peak is no longer in reso-
nance with the ﬁve quasiparticle peaks, we conclude the
quasiparticle system is decoupled from the condensate
in this regime. The sharpness of the condensate peak
also indicates that the condensate oscillations are weakly
damped.

Finally, we analyse thermalization of the distribution

(11)

for diﬀerent values of the center of mass time t+ (see Fig.
4). As expected, for small t+ it does not show any signs
of thermalisation. For large t+ the distribution function
however, approaches thermal distribution, whose temper-
ature can be readily extracted.

To summarise, thermalisation in a ﬁnite isolated sys-
tem is a nontrivial problem. Our system of coupled con-
densate and inﬂationary induced incoherent excitations
thermalizes only because the condensate serves as a heat
reservoir for the quasiparticles, at the same time being
damped by the quasiparticle collisions. By studying sys-
tem dynamics we found a coupling-decoupling crossover
between the condensate and the quasiparticle systems
at the time scale τf , which corresponds to the satura-
tion of the total number of incoherent excitations deter-
mined by total energy conservation and as a result ef-
fective "freezing-out" of the condensate modes. Prior
to τf condensate and quasiparticles are strongly cou-
pled owing dynamically generated parametric resonance,
which can be seen in the resonant spectra of BEC and
quasipartciles. For t > τf BEC and incoherent excita-
tions exhibit oﬀ-resonant behaviour and are eﬀectively
uncoupled. While oﬀ-resonant, the quasiparticle system
slowly relaxes into a thermalized state (with thermaliza-
tion time τth >> τf ). The BEC freeze-out and subse-
quent time evolution under a conservation law are remi-
niscent of "pre-thermalization" found in low-dimensional,
integrable, or close to integrable systems. However, here
the conservation law is generated dynamically in higher
dimensional system. Curiously, the quasiparticle dynam-
ics bears similarities to the inﬂationary creation of quan-
tum ﬂuctuations during the evolution of the early uni-
verse.

Eqs. (S29),
(S30) and (S31) constitute the general
equations of motion for the condensate and the non-
condensate (spectral and statistical) propagators. They
are coupled via the self-energies which are functions of
these propagators and must be evaluated self-consistently
in order to obtain a conserving approximation. The
higher order interaction terms on the right-hand side of
the equations of motion describe inelastic quasi-particle
collisions. They are, in general, responsible for quasi-
particle damping, damping of the condensate oscillations
and for thermalization. We consider them in detail in the
next section.

COLLISIONS

The collisional terms are taken into accont within the
full second order approximation Due to the symmetry re-
lation (S19) we can express the collisional self-energies in
terms of only upper left and upper right components of
the spectral function Anm(t, t′) and the statistical func-
tion Fnm(t, t′). We obtain for γ in (S29)

In order to solve numerically our system of integro-
diﬀerential equations, we discretize the two time argu-
ments, t and t′ with a constant time-step ∆t (see Fig.
S5). As a result, our spectral and statistical functions
become matrices in the two-dimensional time plane. For
instance,

F(t, t′) =


F(0, ∆t)
F(0, 0)
F(∆t, 0) F(∆t, ∆t)

...

F(0, n∆t)

where both time arguments are counted from τc, which is
a ﬁnite time-scale at which the nonequilibrium dynamics

In nonequilibrium it is conventional to introduce mixed
or Wigner coordinates: τ = t − t′ and T = (t + t′)/2 and
then Fourier transform spectral functions and statistical
functions with respect to the relative coordinate. In this
way one can extract information about spectrum and dis-
tribution function for diﬀerent values of T and check if
system approaches equilibrium with increasing T . In our
case it is done by reading oﬀ the calculated spectral and
statistical functions belonging to diagonals with the slope
equal to −1 from the t − t′ plane in Fig. S5. Those will
be data for ﬁxed T -s. We then Fourier transform them
with respect to τ .

sets in [11], so that FG(0, 0) ≡ FG(τc, τc) etc. Both time
scales go up to tmax = n∆t.
In our case tmax = 10.
Fortunately, due to the symmetry relations (S19) it is
suﬃcient to calculate only half of the components of our
propagators, i.e. the triangular matrix

F(t, t′)tri =


which is reﬂected in the time-plane grid in Fig.S5. The
blue points on the grid constitute additional copies of
the diagonal (propagators with equal time arguments)
contributions, necessary to properly perform the fourth
order Runge-Kutta method. Symmetry relations for the
self-energies (S38) also contribute to simpliﬁcations, as
we can rewrite all the integrands in Eqs. (S39), (S40)
with time argument corresponding to later time on the
left, e.g. time convolutions in the equation of motion for
F G can be rewritten as
