In this talk we elaborate on a mechanism to generate local contributions to the cur-
vature perturbation in isolated patches of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
The mechanism, based on the generation of an out-of-equilibrium conﬁguration in ﬂuc-
tuating scalar ﬁelds of mass m ∼ H during a sustained stage of fast-roll inﬂation, has
been recently shown to be capable of accounting for some of the most robust large-angle
anomalies detected in the CMB. In this talk, we show in detail how the embedding of the
mechanism into models including vector ﬁelds can result in the breaking of statistical
isotropy in isolated patches of the CMB.

Keywords: Inﬂation; CMB anomalies; statistical anisotropy.

1. Introduction

Thanks to a wealth of high precision observations of the CMB,1–4 cosmological
inﬂation, and in particular single-ﬁeld inﬂation, is widely accepted as the simplest
paradigm to explain the origin of the observed Universe. However, cosmological
inﬂation still faces a number of diﬃculties, the most obvious one being the large
class of models which, while consistent with data, have very diﬀerent implications
for particle physics. Another less pressing diﬃculty is the persistence, for more than
a decade now, of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, which suggests that single-
ﬁeld inﬂation might need an extension of some kind. These anomalies, entailing the
breaking of statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the CMB, were observed for the
ﬁrst time by the WMAP satellite5, 6 and later conﬁrmed by Planck.7, 8 Since their
existence seems to pose a relative challenge for single-ﬁeld inﬂation, an important
theoretical eﬀort has been dedicated over the past decade to elucidate their origin.

2. A mechanism to generate statistical inhomogeneity

Here we make use of a framework recently discussed in the literature aiming to shed
light on the origin of the CMB anomalies by attributing their origin to the statistical
inhomogeneity developed by diﬀerent isocurvature ﬁelds present during inﬂation.
Following,9, 10 we consider a system of spectator scalar ﬁelds σ and χ, minimally
coupled to gravity and interacting through a term of the forma g2σ2χ2. Ignoring
the interactions of these ﬁelds with other degrees of freedom, the Lagrangian of our
system is

where g is a coupling constant and m0χ is the bare mass of χ. The scalar potential
for σ is V (σ) = 1

σ = cσH 2 where cσ is a constant.

2 m2

The prototype isocurvature ﬁeld σ here considered is allowed to have a large
mass, m ∼ H, and hence we focus on cσ = O(10−1).10 The beneﬁt from this choice
is that the existence of ﬁelds with such a large mass is generic in supergravity
theories.30, 31 However, using this ﬁelds also generates a problem for the initial
conditions. As shown in,10 in order to develop statistical inhomogeneity the ﬁeld σ
must begin the slow-roll with a large value compared to H, which can be achieved
through a sustained stage of fast-roll inﬂation.

2.1. A primary fast-roll stage

To describe the evolution of the classical ﬁeld σ during inﬂation we must specify
the diﬀerent phases of inﬂation. We thus write the total length of inﬂation as

Ntot = Nfr + Nsr , Nsr = N p

sr + N∗ ,

(2)

where “fr” and “sr” stand for fast-roll and slow-roll, respectively. We allow the
primary phase of inﬂation to contain a slow-roll stage, where N p
sr > 0 denotes its
length. Also, the largest cosmological scales cross outside the horizon N∗ e-foldings
before the end of inﬂation. Observations typically demand that 40 . N∗ . 70.

If we stick to a constant value of ǫ, the Hubble parameter is H ∝ a(t)−ǫ, where

a(t) = (1 + ǫH0t)1/ǫ. Using this, we can solve the perturbation modes equation

δ¨σk + 3H ˙δσk +(cid:18) k2

a2 + cσH 2(cid:19) δσk = 0 .

(3)

Solving for the above using the Bunch-Davies solution in the subhorizon limit
k/aH → 0 we ﬁnd the perturbation spectrum

Fig. 1. Evolution of Σ2/H 2 during inﬂation (using diﬀerent ǫ) for a ﬁeld with mass cσ = 0.15.

In Fig. 1 we plot the evolution of Σ2/H 2 during inﬂation, using diﬀerent values
of ǫ. Our plot shows that for a suﬃciently large ǫ, the ratio Σ2/H 2 grows unbounded
due to the rapid scaling of H. However, if ǫ is small (curve with ǫ = 0.025), the
growth of Σ2/H 2 becomes bounded (dashed line), and hence typical values of σ
always remain in the same order of magnitude as H.

2.2. Trapping the rolling σ

Once the fast-roll stage is over and typical ﬁeld values are σ > σc, the ﬁeld starts
to slow-roll. Using the slow-roll approximation we write

σ(t) = σ0 exp(−cσN/3) ,

(6)

where N counts the number of e-foldings after all CMB scales cross outside the
horizon. Eventually, it reaches the critical value σc ∼ g−1H and the χ ﬁeld starts
undergoing particle production during inﬂation. This production of particles triggers
a trapping mechanism that forces σ to oscillate about the origin of its eﬀective
potential. In this oscillatory regime, the typical amplitude of the ﬁeld scales as
σ ∝ a−3/2 and hence it becomes negligible by the end of inﬂation. However, since
due to the inﬂationary ﬂuctuations of σ the trapping occurs in diﬀerent places at
diﬀerent times, it becomes possible that in some regions (called out-of-equilibrium
patches) σ does not become trapped before the end of inﬂation, thus retaining a
large, out-of-equilibrium value that can be considered as a relic from a primary

stage of fast-roll inﬂation. Consequently, the role played by the interaction term is
to motivate the existence of regions in the observable Universe where σ, thanks to
its retaining a large value, can leave an observable imprint in the CMB.

In order to describe the evolution of the ﬁeld from the slow-roll to the oscillatory
stage, we must solve the coupled system of equations arising from (1). In the Hartree
approximation, the dynamics of σ and χ is determined by the equations

¨σ + 3H ˙σ + (cσH 2 + g2hχ2i)σ = 0 ,

¨χk + 3H ˙χk +(cid:18) k2

where

We solve this system numerically, using an initial condition σ > σc motivated by the
hypothesized existence of a sustained fast-roll stage. In our numerical solutionb we
allow the production of the χ ﬁeld only when σ(tc) = σc. Using diﬀerent multiplici-
ties for the χ ﬁeld, with Nχ = O(102), we ﬁnd that the transition to the oscillation
regime of σ takes a few e-foldings to complete.

3. Shedding light on the origin of CMB anomalies

Recently, it has been investigated the possibility that CMB anomalies are due to
the statistical inhomogeneity obtained by diﬀerent isocurvature ﬁelds of mass m ∼
H present during inﬂation.9, 10 The framework presented shows that if primary
inﬂation contains a sustained stage of fast-roll, like the one studied in the previous
section, and primary slow-roll lasts only for a few tens of e-foldings at most, then
it is feasible that the large expectation value obtained by the isocurvature ﬁelds is
responsible for some of the CMB anomalies. In particular, in Ref. 10 it is shows that
making use of the inhomogeneous reheating and of the curvaton mechanism, it is
possible to account for the Cold Spot, the power deﬁcit at low ℓ and the breaking
of statistical isotropy. In this talk, I focus on the latter and show that the curvature
perturbation contributed by the vector ﬁeld, using the vector curvaton mechanism,
indeed obtains a patchy structure, being observable in isolated patches of the CMB.

bWe solve the coupled system in time steps ∆t = 0.025H −1
so that a total of 40 modes cross
outside the horizon per e-folding, thus contributing to hχ2i in Eq. (9). We integrate the coupled
system for seven e-foldings, thus employing modes with comoving wavenumber from k = H∗
(crossing outside the horizon at tc) up to k = e7H∗. Moreover, all of the modes χk considered in
the solution begin the evolution in the Bunch-Davies vacuum.

3.1. The local breaking of statistical isotropy

In order to keep our model in the simplest, we consider the well-studied case of a
massive vector ﬁeld Aµ with a varying kinetic function32

LA = −

1
4

f Fµν F µν +

1
2

m2AµAµ .

(10)

Arguably, this is the simplest stable theory in which massive vector ﬁelds can be
produced during inﬂation.33–35 In order for the vector ﬁeld to be substantially pro-
duced during inﬂation, the kinetic function of the vector ﬁeld and its mass are
allowed to have a time-dependence parametrized by

f ∝ aα

and m ∝ aβ .

(11)

Using this, a successful vector curvaton mechanism can be built, with a scale-
invariant spectrum of vector perturbations for appropriate values36 of α and β.

In order to break statistical isotropy, we envisage the case when f becomes
modulated by the ﬁeld σ in Eq. (1), i.e. f = f (σ). Of course, we also include the
χ ﬁeld sector and assume the necessary conditions so that σ obtains a distribution
of out-of-equilibrium patches at the end of inﬂation. In turn, the emergence of out-
of-equilibrium patches, and hence the fact that in some regions σ starts to oscillate
before the end of inﬂation, entails that in such regions the scaling regime in Eq. (11)
ﬁnishes before the end of inﬂation. As a result, the energy density of the vector ﬁeld
at the end of inﬂation depends on the spatial location, namely

ρA,end = ρA,end(x) .

(12)

In the next section, we demonstrate this spatial dependence by solving numerically
the dynamics of the vector ﬁeld. For now, we show how this spatial dependence is
transfered to the curvature perturbation by means of the vector curvaton scenario.36

Following,32 the total curvature perturbation can be written as

ζ = (1 − ˆΩA)ζrad + ˆΩAζA ,

(13)

where ζrad is the curvature perturbation present in the radiation dominated uni-
verse after inﬂation, ζA is the curvature perturbation in the vector ﬁeld, ˆΩA ≡
3ΩA/(4 − ΩA) sets the relative contribution of each component to the total curva-
ture perturbation and ΩA ≡ ρA/ρ. Taking ΩA . 1 when the vector curvaton decays,
the anisotropic contribution to ζ can be approximated by

ζani(x) = ˆΩAζA ≃

√3
4π (cid:20) (ΩA)dec

(ΩA)end

(14)

Arranging the end of the scaling regime for f in out-of-equilibrium patches at the
end of inﬂation, the factor in square brackets becomes independent of x, but ΩA,end
depends on x, as suggested by Eq. (12).

3.2. Numerical computation

For simplicity, we assume that the dynamics of the vector ﬁeld does not backreact on
σ and follow a phenomenological approach to model the transition from the scaling
regime f ∝ aα to the end of the scaling, where f = 1. We model this transition by
means of a time-dependent exponent α(t), varying from α = −4 (corresponding to a
scale-invariant vector perturbation spectrum) to α = 0, where f = 1, in a lapse of a
few e-foldings, as suggested by the numerical solution to the system in Eqs. (7)-(9).
However, the kinetic function is modulated by σ, which is distributed according
to a probability density owing to its inﬂationary ﬂuctuations. For concreteness, we
take this probability to peak around a given ﬁeld value when the largest observable
scale crosses the horizon. Therefore, when the shortest CMB scale exits the hori-
zon, the ﬁeld’s probability density, denoted by PCMB(σ0), is a Gaussian with mean
¯σ0 (which we treat as a free parameter) and variance Σ2
4π2 NCMB, where
NCMB ≃ 9. Here, we stress that we are interested in the probability density that
carries the information on σ-ﬁeld correlations only on CMB scales at the end of in-
ﬂation. Consequently, we do not allow inﬂationary ﬂuctuations to source PCMB(σ0)
once CMB scales become superhorizon (see Refs. 9, 10 for a detailed discussion),
and hence PCMB(σ0) follows a deterministic evolution until it reaches the barrier.
Once σ = σc and a classical χ ﬁeld starts becoming produced, ﬂuctuations in the
number density of produced χ particles will source ﬂuctuations of the classical σ
(see for example Ref. 27). Nevertheless, in the Hartree approximation the source
term, proportional to (χ2−hχ2i), is neglected, and hence the production of the ﬁeld
χ does not induce further ﬂuctuations of σ. Therefore, in the Hartree approxima-
tion the evolution of PCMB(σ0) remains fully deterministic until the end of inﬂation.
Going beyond the Hartree approximation, one can expect that the additional ﬂuc-
tuations of σ will increase the ﬂuctuations in the energy density of the vector ﬁeld
at then end of inﬂation, thus contributing to ζani(x) in Eq. (14). Therefore, the
Hartree approximation allows us to obtain the minimal eﬀects regarding an statis-
tically inhomogeneous anisotropic contribution to the total curvature perturbation,
or the local breaking of statistical isotropy for short.

CMB ≃ H 2

Taking all the above into account, diﬀerent values of σ (allowed by PCMB(σ0))
imply that ﬁeld interactions between σ and χ become dynamically important at
diﬀerent times in diﬀerent spatial locations. As previously discussed, in the Hartree
approximation the exponent α(t) follows the same evolution in diﬀerent regions but
at diﬀerent times, with the time delay determined by the amplitude of ﬂuctuations
of σ present right after CMB scales become superhorizon. This is represented in
Fig. 2, where the thick solid line depicts the evolution of the exponent α(t) corre-
sponding to the central value ¯σ0, whereas dashed and dot-dashed lines depict the
evolution corresponding to ¯σ0 − 3ΣCMB and ¯σ0 − 3ΣCMB, respectively, thus implying
an anticipated and delayed exit of the scaling regime for f .
Using the physical vector ﬁeld W ≡ √f A/a and its module W = |W|, the

In the righthand panel of Fig. 2 we plot the energy density, normalized with respect
to its initial value ρi. We observe that as long as the scaling regime with α ≃ −4
lasts, ρA remains approximately constant, and starts decreasing when α ≃ 0. As
a result of the diﬀerent exit time of the scaling regime, the energy density of the
vector ﬁeld at the end of inﬂation becomes distributed according to a probability
density. As we show in the next section, if inﬂation ﬁnishes at N = N3 or N = N4,
a relatively small fraction of regions exist where ρA,end ≃ ρi whereas in other (more
abundant) regions we ﬁnd ρA,end ≪ ρi. This demonstrates both the dependence of
ΩA with position (and hence that of ζani(x)) and the possibility of a local breaking
of statistical isotropy.

3.3. The curvature perturbation ζani(x) as a stochastic variable

The purpose of this section is to transform the probability density PCMB(σ0), de-
scribing the distribution of σ once all CMB scales cross outside the horizon, into
a probability density where ζani(x) is the stochastic variable. This can be achieved
by performing the necessary changes of variable.

For a given spatial patch we denote by tc the associated critical time, de-
ﬁned by the condition σ(tc) = σc. Since σ is light enough to undergo parti-
cle production, the slow-roll approximation allows us to rewrite this condition as
σ0 = σc exp (cσHtc/3). Using the above and the conservation of probability, we

March 7, 2016 1:26 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

may write express PCMB(σ0) in terms of the critical time as follows

PCMB(tc) =

dσ0
dtc

PCMB(σ0(tc)) .

(17)

Given initial conditions W0,

˙W0 for W and a critical time tc, ρA at the end of
inﬂation is a function of the critical time tc only, i.e. ρA,end(tc) ≡ ρA(Nend, tc).
Therefore, we can write PCMB(tc) as follows

PCMB(ρA,end) =

dtc

dρA,end

PCMB(tc(ρA,end)) .

(18)

To compute the above derivative we note that ﬁeld histories with diﬀerent tc are
approximately the same after the proper synchronization. Using the history with ¯σ0
as reference, we deﬁne the shift δt ≡ tc − ¯tc, where ¯tc is the critical time associated
with ¯σ0 (see Fig. 2). Therefore, in the separate universe approach we have

ρA(Nend, tc) = ρA(Nend − Hδt, ¯tc) ,

(19)

which aﬀords us to compute tc = tc(ρA,end), and hence the derivative in Eq. (18),
from the numerical solution for ρA depicted in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2. Now,
introducing the relative energy density ρr ≡ ρA,end/ρi we have

PCMB(ρr) =

PCMB(ρA,end(ρr)) .

dρA,end

dρr

(20)

(21)

In view of Eq. (14), we deﬁne the variable

ζr(x) ≡ ζani(x)/ζi = ρ1/2

r

(x) ,

where ζi is the curvature perturbation contributed by the vector ﬁeld when ρA,end ≃
ρi. Or equivalently, when the scaling regime for f lasts until the end of inﬂation.
Using all the above we arrive at the desired result

PCMB(ζr) =

(22)

In Fig. 3 we plot our results for the probability PCMB(ζr) when inﬂation ﬁnishes
at diﬀerent Nend (see also Fig. 2 for comparison). For Nend = N1, the probability
PCMB(ζr) peaks around ζr = 1, indicating a statistically homogeneous contribution
of the vector ﬁeld to the curvature perturbation. In this case, a highly anisotropic
vector perturbation becomes incompatible with observations unless it gives a sub-
dominant contribution to the total curvature perturbation.32, 35, 36 For N = N2,
PCMB(ζr) still accumulates predominantly around ζr = 1, but in some regions, mak-
ing up a non-negligible fraction of the observable Universe, the scaling regime for
f is already over. Therefore, in those regions we ﬁnd ζani < ζi. Consequently, for
N ≥ N2 the vector ﬁeld perturbation starts becoming statistically inhomogeneous.
For N = N3, we ﬁnd that only in a limited fraction of the observable Universe it
becomes possible to ﬁnd ζani ≃ ζi, whereas in the remaining part ζani < ζi. Tun-
ing the parameters of the vector ﬁeld model, one can arrange that ζi ∼ 10−5, and
hence the contribution of the vector ﬁeld becomes observable in out-of-equilibrium

patches only. Since the vector perturbation is statistically very inhomogeneous, the
CMB anisotropy constraint on cosmological vector ﬁelds,4, 8, 37–39 obtained under
the assumption of statistical homogeneity of the perturbation, can be consequently
evaded. As a result, the vector ﬁeld may be allowed to imprint a highly anisotropic
contribution to the curvature perturbation. This argument has been recently put
forward in Ref. 10 to hypothesize the existence of a vector spot in the CMB. Finally,
for N = N4 the curvature perturbation ζani becomes too small to be observable.

4. Conclusions

In this talk we follow an approach recently presented in the literature, aiming to
provide a common framework for the origin of the large-angle CMB anomalies, to
elaborate in detail on the breaking of statistical isotropy employing a vector ﬁeld
model in which the kinetic function f is modulated by an isocurvature ﬁeld σ that
can ﬂuctuate during inﬂation. Thanks to a preexisting stage of fast-roll inﬂation, σ
features an out-of-equilibrium conﬁguration at the beginning of the slow-roll, but
due to its coupling to the scalar sector χ, at the end of inﬂation such an out-of-
equilibrium conﬁguration remains only in sparse regions of the observable Universe.
To investigate the implications of the patchy structure of σ for the vector ﬁeld,
we study a phenomenological model to account for the variation of f induced by
the dynamics of the isocurvature ﬁeld σ, which we solve numerically assuming no

backreaction from the vector ﬁeld. Motivated by the dynamics of σ, in the proposed
model we impose that the transition from the scaling regime with α = −4 (allowing
the inﬂationary production of the vector ﬁeld) to f = 1 (causing the rapid depletion
of the vector ﬁeld’s energy density) takes place in a few e-foldings (see Fig. 2). This
transition is triggered at the critical time tc, that depends on the ﬁeld value σ0
(taken after CMB scales become superhorizon). Therefore, using this model and
a particular tc (corresponding to a given spatial patch), we solve numerically the
evolution of the vector ﬁeld W and its energy density ρA. However, to compute
ρA,end in diﬀerent regions of the Universe we must take into account the ﬂuctuations
obtained by σ while CMB scales exit the horizon, encoded in the probability density
PCMB(σ0). Such ﬂuctuations are transferred to f , thus giving rise to ﬂuctuations in
ρA,end. Our results show that if the scaling regime ﬁnishes during inﬂation, the
ﬂuctuations in ρA can span several orders of magnitude (see Fig. 2).

Finally, we examine the implications of the ﬂuctuations in ρA,end for the cur-
vature perturbation contributed by the vector ﬁeld ζani (see Eq. (14)). To do so,
we transform the probability density PCMB(σ0) into a probability density where the
stochastic variable ζani, which takes diﬀerent values in diﬀerent regions. In Fig. 3
we plot the resulting probability PCMB(ζr), where ζr ∝ ζani, for diﬀerent situations
at the end of inﬂation (compare with Fig. 2). Our results, although derived from
a phenomenological model, demonstrate that the large ﬂuctuations in ρA,end give
rise to a statistical inhomogeneous contribution ζani(x) which, after tuning the pa-
rameters of the vector ﬁeld model, can be arranged to be observable only in sparse
regions of the Universe, thus leading to a local breaking of statistical isotropy.
