ABSTRACT
The cosmic distance can be precisely determined using a ‘standard ruler’ imprinted
by primordial baryon acoustic oscillation (hereafter BAO) in the early Universe. The
BAO at the targeted epoch is observed by analysing galaxy clustering in redshift space
(hereafter RSD) for which a theoretical formulation is not yet fully understood, and
thus makes this methodology unsatisfactory. The BAO analysis following a full RSD
modelling is contaminated by systematic uncertainties due to a non–linear smearing
eﬀects such as non–linear corrections and by random viral velocity of galaxies. How-
ever, the BAO can be probed independently of RSD contamination using the BAO
peak positions located in the 2D anisotropic correlation function. A new methodology
is presented to measure peak positions, to test whether it is also contaminated by the
same systematics in RSD, and to provide the radial and transverse cosmic distances
determined by the 2D BAO peak positions. We ﬁnd that in our model independent
anisotropic clustering analysis we can obtain about 2% and 5% constraints on DA and
H−1 respectively with current BOSS data, which is competitive with other analysis.
shift space (hereafter RSD), which is contaminated by non–
linear physics. The transformation between real and redshift
space is intrinsically non–linear, in that the density pertur-
bation and velocity ﬁelds are coupled together and evolve
nonlinearly. The factorized formulation has been proposed
to achieve the RSD theoretical model, which turns out to
be the combination of non–separable linear squeezing eﬀect
and non–linear smearing eﬀects caused by those higher or-
der polynomials. The small scale distortion along the line of
sight is caused by the randomness of the velocity ﬁeld, called
the Finger of God (hereafter FoG) eﬀect. This eﬀect is non–
perturbative, and there is little clue of its exact theoretical
form neither in scale nor in time. All of these systematics are
combined in the full RSD analysis, which make lowers our
conﬁdence on the cosmological constraints from the RSD ef-
fect beyond a conservative limited scale at the quite linear
regime.

However, the characteristic BAO distances can be
probed alternatively, being independent of the detailed
knowledge of galaxy clustering in redshift space, by making
measurements of the oscillation scale while ignoring or other-
wise marginalising the overall shape. In recent eﬀorts several
works have targeted the BAO scale using the 1D isotropic
density power spectrum and correlation functions (Anderson
et al. 2012, 2014) while ignoring or otherwise marginalis-
ing out the overall shape of the clustering signal. The BAO
scale has been shown to be quite insensitive to non-linear
physics and other systematics (Song et al. 2014), however
for near future experiments e.g. DESI some of these system-
atics will have to be understood or controlled to a greater
degree (Prada et al. 2014).

The anisotropies of the clustering pattern of the galaxy
distribution can also arises from any discrepancy between

1 INTRODUCTION

Precise measurement of cosmic distance has become a key
targeted observable for probing the cause of cosmic acceler-
ation. The cosmic acceleration has been conﬁrmed by many
observations (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999), and
our understanding of the universe has undergone a revolu-
tion with this new discovery. The standard model of the
universe needs to be altered to either contain the yet un-
known dark sector energy components, or to modify gravi-
tational physics at large scale. The cosmic distance probes
will provide us with the evolution of cosmic expansion from
the epochs in which the cosmic expansion starts to be ac-
celerated, and with the clues to include dark materials or
dark gravity in order to complete the standard model of the
universe.

Cosmic distances are observed by cosmic parallax, stan-
dard candles and standard rulers, but most methods suﬀer
from their own systematics. Among all of these diverse ap-
proaches, the standard ruler method is considered the most
risk–free technique to probe cosmic distance. The acoustic
peak structure of the baryon–photon ﬂuid in the early uni-
verse is developed by the tension between gravitational infall
and radiative pressure and imprinted on the last-scattering
surface. The fossil record remain imprinted on the large-
scale galaxy clustering even today (hereafter BAO Blake &
Glazebrook 2003; Seo & Eisenstein 2003; Eisenstein et al.
2005). The characteristic scale of the BAO can be used as
a standard ruler, which enables us to determine geometric
distances for high-z galaxies to great precision. Previously
geometric distances were determined by analysing simulta-
neously the clustering anisotropies over the BAO scales. The
galaxy clustering at the targeted area is observed in the red-

the true underlying cosmological model and the model used
to convert the redshift and angular position of each galaxy
to the co-moving radial and transverse distances. This is the
so-called Alcock-Paczynski (A-P) eﬀect (Alcock & Paczyn-
ski 1979) and with a prior knowledge of the characteristic
scale of the BAO, the Hubble parameter H(z) and angu-
lar diameter distance DA(z) at the high-z galaxies can be
separately measured (Hu & Haiman 2003; Song et al. 2014).
There have been several methods proposed that apply
the AP test to the large scale structure by measuring the
clustering of galaxies (Ballinger Peacock & Heavens 1996;
Matsubara & Suto 1996; Li et al. 2015), symmetry proper-
ties of galaxy pairs (Marinoni & Buzzi 2010), and cosmic
voids (Ryden 1995; Lavaux & Wandelt 2012). Among them,
the method of galaxy clustering has been widely used to
constrain cosmological parameters (Outram et al. 2004; Pad-
manabhan & White 2008; Gazta˜naga et al. 2009; Blake et al.
2011a,b; Chuang & Wang 2012; Song et al. 2014; Linder et
al. 2014; Beutler et al. 2013; Reid et al. 2012; Samushia et al.
2013; Jeong et al. 2014; S´anchez et al. 2014; Ross et al. 2015).
The main caveat of this method is that, because the radial
distances of galaxies are inferred from redshifts, AP tests
are inevitably limited by redshift-space-distortions (RSD),
which leads to apparent anisotropy even if the adopted cos-
mology is correct (Ballinger Peacock & Heavens 1996).

In this work we will

introduce our anisotropic (2-
dimensional) galaxy clustering statistic and show how in an
ideal case, free of systematics, this can be used to locate
the BAO peak location and thus obtain information on DA
and H independently. We also show that this methodology
is robust against the systematics of unknown bias and un-
determined shape of the underlying power spectrum. How-
ever, as we will show later, the unknown FoG eﬀect causes
an anisotropic shift in the BAO location which induces a
degeneracy been it and Hubble parameter H(z). Thus we
proceed to model this shift and marginalise out its eﬀects
reducing the systematic bias. This methodology is robustly
tested using Monte Carlo simulations of the galaxy distribu-
tion where we show that we can reliably recover the ﬁducial
input cosmological parameters.
The outline of this paper proceeds as follows. In §2 we
brieﬂy review the Alcock-Paczynski eﬀect in a cosmological
context and describe the statistical methods we will employ.
In §3 we investigate the BAO peak structure and its sensi-
tivity to various systematic uncertainties. In §4 we test our
methodology on simulated mock galaxy catalogs and derive
cosmological parameter constraints. We conclude in §5.

2 DETERMINATION OF GEOMETRICAL

DISTANCES USING THE BAO RING

The observed galaxy clustering anisotropies are plagued by
systematic uncertainties which causes the measured geomet-
ric distances through BAO feature unreliable compared to
other distance probes of the Universe. When the galaxy clus-
tering is viewed from the redshift space, the cosmological
density and velocity ﬁelds couple together and evolve nonlin-
early. In addition, the mapping formula between the real and
redshift space is intrinsically nonlinear. These nonlinearities
prevent us from inferring the linear coherent motion from
the redshift space clustering straightforwardly. Although an

accurate theoretical model for the redshift distortion was
proposed in, there is no conﬁrming statement whether the
measured distances are immune from the complexity arising
from all diﬀerent types of theoretical models to explain the
cosmic acceleration.

We propose that the geometrical distances can be deter-
mined with exploiting BAO feature as minimal as possible.
In the context of standard cosmology, the BAO peak struc-
ture is known by analysing cosmic microwave background
(hereafter CMB) anisotropy produced before the last scat-
tering surface. The primordial BAO feature is probed in
precision by CMB experiments. Then we claim that there
is a unique correspondence between the measured primor-
dial BAO feature by CMB and the observed geometrical
BAO signature by galaxy clustering survey, which is nearly
independent of other cosmological uncertainties.

The geometrical signature of primeval BAO is pre-
cisely observed through galaxy clustering correlation func-
tion ξ(σ, π), where σ and π denote the transverse and radial
by s ≡ √
distances. The two point correlation distance s is deﬁned
σ2 + π2. The clustering patterns are diﬀerent be-
tween inner and outer contours. The monotonous anisotropic
shape is observed with inner contours at s (cid:46) 100 Mpc.
The squeezed clustering pattern along the radial direction
is determined by the competition between monopole and
quadrupole ampliﬁcations which are caused by density and
velocity ﬂuctuations respectively. BAO peak structure is ob-
served at outer contours encompassing to cross s ∼ 150Mpc.
The primordial wiggles on the spectra turns out continuous
peaks along the BAO ring at s ∼ 150 Mpc which takes an im-

ring is presented in Fig. 1.

In our previous work, the full anisotropy analysis is ex-
ploited to measure distances. The BAO ring is observed to
be invariant by the variation of structure formation when
the broadband shape of spectra is previously determined by
CMB experiments. Thus we are able to probe distances af-
ter marginalising over all structure formation parameters,
such as the density & velocity growth functions, the galaxy
bias and the random velocity eﬀect. Although it is a thor-
ough methodology, the measured distances can be biased by
unknown clustering systematics.

Inspired by the invariance of the BAO ring, we sug-
gest a new methodology to determine it, independent of any
knowledge of the galaxy clustering. In practice, the observed
spectra are estimated using referenced coordinates, not true
coordinates, because the transformation rule between the
observed (Ra, Dec, z) and the cartesian coordinates of dis-
tance measures is unknown. The ﬁducial cosmology is used
to convert the observed (Ra, Dec, z) into comoving Carte-
sian coordinates. The degree of spatial distortion from this
ﬁducial coordinate can be described by the following quan-
tities,

[∆π/∆σ]ﬁd
[∆π/∆σ]true

=

[DA(z)H(z)]true
[DA(z)H(z)]ﬁd

,

(1)

where ∆π, ∆σ are the angular and radial sizes of the ob-
jects, and “true” and “ﬁd” denote the values of quantities in
the true cosmology and ﬁducial cosmology. DA and H are
the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, re-
spectively. These geometrical quantities can provide us with
information on the particular energy components of the Uni-
verse and in the speciﬁc case of a model with constant dark
energy equation of state. However, if we independently de-
termine the BAO ring, which spans both transverse and ra-
dial cosmological coordinates, it can be exploited to probe
the distance measures of DA and H−1.

We proceed to construct an estimator to locate the BAO
peaks of ξ(σ, π) represented by the squared points in Fig. 1.
The observed distance between two galaxies s is deﬁned as-
suming a ﬁducial or reference cosmological model, and the
observed cosine of the angle the pair makes with respect to
the line of sight, µ is given by

µ =

π
s

.

(2)

The estimate of these separations is dependent on the as-
sumed cosmology model. We estimate the 2-point correla-
tion function (2PCF) in redshift-space and in the anisotropic
s, µ-decomposition transformed from σ, π coordinates. The
correlation functions are calculated using the “Landy-
Szalay” estimator,

¯ξµ(s) at each wedge is presented as black solid points. The cor-
respondent µ for each curve is given by µ=0.92, 0.75, 0.58, 0.42,
0.25, 0.08 from the top to bottom. The dash curves represent the
best ﬁt curves deﬁned by Eq. 4

−(s−D)2/C + F,

median µ at each µ bin, is estimated by the ﬁtting function,
¯ξµ(s), which is given by,
¯ξµ(s) × s2 = A.s2 + B.s + Ee
which is just a quadratic function to mimic the overall shape
of the correlation function and a gaussian to model the BAO
peak. In our work the focus will be on constraining the scale
parameter, D, as a function of the anisotropy angle, µ. The
measured D(µ) represents the radial distance of the peak
location at the given µ bin which is presented at the squared
points in Fig. 1. In this process the other 5 parameters will
be marginalised over.

(4)

We simulate the observed ξ(s, µ) using a theoretical lin-
ear correlation function. We then proceed to ﬁt the individ-
ual ¯ξµ(s) to this simulation using the model in Eq. 4 while
considering 1% measurement error and no covariance be-
tween points. However in §4 where we consider mock galaxy
data we will consider realistic errors and the full covariance
between the data. In Fig.2 we show the 2PCF, ξ(s) for var-
ious µ values. In all µ-directions the BAO feature is clearly
seen. The ﬁtting was done using a 20,000 chain mcmc over
the the range in scales 80 Mpc < s < 180 Mpc, sampled in 15
linearly spaced bins. The errors on the measurements were
assumed to be small, 1% and uncorrelated.

The BAO characteristic distances located at peak posi-
tions of ξ(s, µ) appear as a great circle in the s and µ plane
which can be described by BAO peak ellipse as,

where DD is the number of galaxy–galaxy pairs, DR the

and angle µ ± ∆µ. The pair counts are normalised since we
use 20 times as many randoms and data point to reduce shot
noise contributions to the correlation estimation.

dial distances respectively. The observed angular positions
and redshift are transformed to the co–moving distance for
measuring ξ(s, µ) of the underlying theoretical model. The
anisotropy pattern is induced to the observed ξ(s, µ) by the
apparent possible discrepancy between the ﬁducial and true
cosmologies. The true BAO ellipse is recovered by an ap-
propriate transformation between two diﬀerent cosmologies,

However, for the above relations to be considered unbiased
estimators, the extracted distances from the ﬁducial model
must be free from systematic uncertainties associated with
our incomplete knowledge of galaxy clustering. The system-
atics will be investigated in the next section.

3 TEST ON CONTAMINATION BY

SYSTEMATICS IN DETERMINING 2D BAO

The initial matter-energy ﬂuctuations cause the source for
baryon acoustic waves that propagated in the photon-
electron-baryon plasma of the early universe. These acoustic
waves travel, before they stop at the epoch of recombination.
The initial density peak of excess of matter observed at last
scattering surface remains at the galaxy clustering at late
epoch. This distance provides a standard ruler to determine
both transverse and radial distances. In practice, there are
nuisance systematic uncertainties, which prevent us from di-
rectly accessing the primeval BAO signature. Those system-
atics are classiﬁed into uncertainties due to the biased galaxy
clustering to dark matter ﬂuctuations, the non–perturbative
eﬀect from random velocities, and the unknown theoretical
model of dark energy at late time. The methodology has
been extensively developed to probe primeval BAO struc-
ture after marginalising all those nuisance parameters. The
measured distances through simultaneous determination of
all others are proved to be useful for diverse classes of
theoretical models, but the determination is still model–
dependent. We are interested in the opposite direction in
which we remove those systematics from our analysis, in-
stead of adding it to the analysis.

3.1 Fiducial model
The ﬁducial distances of DA and H−1 are provided by the-
oretical RSD modelling using the perturbation theory. In
computing the RSD power spectrum, we need to properly
take into account the eﬀect of nonlinear gravitational evo-
lution for the auto- and cross-power spectra PXY (k). Since
the standard perturbation theory is known to produce ill-
behaved expansion leading to the bad UV behavior, a consis-
tent calculation of the correlation function should be made
with an improved perturbation theory that includes appro-
priate UV regularization. Here, we apply the resummed per-
turbation theory called RegPT (Taruya et al. 2012), and fol-
lowing the prescription described in (Taruya, Nishimichi &
Bernardeau 2013), we compute the power spectra PXY (k),
including nonlinear corrections up to the two-loop.

As we can see from the top left panel of Fig. 3, there is a
noticeable diﬀerence in the clustering patterns of ξ(σ, π) be-
tween the linear and non-linear models. More quantitatively
this leads to a shift in the distances D|| and D⊥ about a
percentage level which are summarised in the tables below.

Template D||
linear
RegPT

152.12
153.33

D⊥
153.33
154.54

This shift nessecarily requires us to model the clustering us-
ing non-linear templates even at large scales near the BAO
peak position. However, the BAO ring is observed at rela-
tively large scales of about 150 Mpc in which the perturba-
tive theory predicts the dominant higher order non–linear
corrections in precision. The BAO remains as a standard
ruler as far as the non–linear corrections are predictable
in this regime. Therefore the non–linear eﬀect on the BAO
peaks is not counted as a systematic in this work, and the
theoretical ξ(σ, π) is derived from RegPT theory.
The cosmic distances of DA and H−1 are determined
by the measured shifts of the BAO distances, D⊥ and D(cid:107),
from their ﬁducial values. The variation of measured DA and
H−1 is presented in the following subsections with respect to
changes of all nuisance systematics. The D⊥ and D(cid:107) deﬁned
in Eq. 5 are measured to be 154.5 Mpc and 153.3 Mpc for the
ﬁducial cosmology. Distances of DA and H−1 are calculated
from the fractional diﬀerence in measured D⊥ and D(cid:107) for
each systematic uncertainty case. The ﬁducial DA and H−1
at z = 0.57 are 1395.2 Mpc and 3234.8 Mpc.

3.2 Galaxy bias

Although the theoretical model of galaxy clustering to dark
matter distribution is unknown, galaxy bias can be described
using the following phenomenological function which is given
by,

b(k) = b0

1 + A2k2
1 + A1k

(7)

where b0 denotes the coherent galaxy bias, and An denote
the scale dependent bias parameters. The shape of ξ(s, µ)
changes with the variation of An, but there is little eﬀect
on outer contours at s > 100Mpc. The determination of D
indicating the location of BAO peaks is immune from the
scale dependent bias systematics. Therefore we mainly focus
on the eﬀect by coherent bias variation in this subsection.
The observed location of BAO peaks varies with diﬀerent
b0, but we observe that the 2D BAO ring remains invariant.
In the table below we show the eﬀect of changing the linear
bias factor on the derived distance measures. Since the bias
only alters the amplitude of the clustering signal we should
not expect a shift in the BAO peak position. However we
investigate the change in bias in the case that our minimal
model can still ﬁt the peak position without introducing any
systematic variation due to inaccurate ﬁtting. We ﬁnd that
values of b0 = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 all give consistent values of D⊥
and D(cid:107) and induce subpercent level shifts in DA and H−1.
In the top right panel of Fig. 3, we present the ξ(σ, π)
with variation of bias. The solid, dash and dotted contours
represent the ξ(σ, π) with b0 = 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 respectively.
No signiﬁcant deviation of BAO ring is observed with varia-
tion of coherent galaxy bias b. We present it more quantita-
tively in the table below. The measured DA and H−1 does
not deviate more than 0.8% with respect to the variation
of b0. The fractional deviation is presented in the bracket.
Therefore we are able to measure distances through BAO
ring despite the unknown galaxy bias.

3.3 Standard ruler against variation of

cosmological model

The primeval matter-energy ﬂuctuations are assumed to be
known by CMB experiments. We test whether it is suﬃcient
for determining distances through the observed BAO peaks.
In the context of standard cosmology, the shape of spectra is

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

determined before the last scattering surface, and in linear
theory, it evolves coherently through all scales. The history
of structure formation evolution is divided into two regimes;
epochs before matter–radiation equality and a later epoch of
coherent evolution of unknown eﬀect on structure formation
from new physics.

True cosmological model can be diﬀerent from the ﬁdu-
cial model, but it satisﬁes with the given CMB prior. If we
lives in ΛCDM universe, but the ﬁducial cosmology is not
consistent with the true cosmology. There is only one de-
grees of freedom to vary with the imposed CMB priors. Here
we vary H0 to remain ωb and ωm unchanged. Two diﬀerent

cosmologies with the same BAO structure are tested in the
table below. We test H0 = 61 km/s/ Mpc and 73 km/s/ Mpc
cases. If those cases are considered as the ﬁducial model,
we would not ﬁnd any diﬀerence in the measured distances,
within 0.2%. The BAO indeed remains as a standard ruler
against variation of cosmological model, as far as those stem
from the same primeval spectra at the last scattering sur-
face. It suggests that BAO will probe the true distances
regardless of the ﬁducial models used.

In the bottom left panel of Fig.3 we show the clustering
contours for ΩΛ = 0.62, 0.73. We see that variations in ΩΛ
lead to shifts in the contours but as we determined and
presented in the table above, the BAO ring shape is not
aﬀected.

3.4 Non–perturbative eﬀect from randomness of

peculiar velocity: Weak limit

The contamination due to the randomness of velocity is
not formulated in the above perturbation theory. This eﬀect
dubbed as FoG (hereafter Finger of God) is phenomenolog-
ically given by Gaussian approximation as,

˜P (k, µ) =(cid:2)Pδδ(k) + 2µ2PδΘ(k) + µ4PΘΘ(k)(cid:3) GFoG(kµσv) ,
GFoG = exp(cid:2)−(kµσv)2(cid:3) .

where GFoG is given by,

(9)

Here σv denotes the velocity dispersion.

The ﬁducial value of σv is given by the linear veloc-
ity dispersion of σv = 5 Mpc. Once the power spectrum
has been computed, it is straightforward to compute the
correlation function. The redshift-space correlation function
ξs(σ, µ) is generally expanded as
˜P (k, µ)eik·s.

ξs(σ, π) =

(cid:90)

(10)

Here we also consider the bias due to galaxy clustering. The
matter density ﬁeld is replaced with the galaxy density ﬁeld
by coherent bias factor b = 2. The systematic uncertainty
due to galaxy bias is examined in the next subsection.

We ﬁrst consider the ﬁngers-of-god eﬀect where the
galaxy distribution is elongated in redshift space, with an
axis of elongation pointed toward the observer. It is caused
by a Doppler shift associated with the random peculiar ve-
locities of galaxies bound in structures such as clusters. The
deviation from the Hubble’s law relationship between dis-
tance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate
distance measurements.

In a simple case we can assume that this FoG is given
by a factorized form as in Eq. (8). Because we are mainly
interested in clustering about the BAO ring, which has the
most contribution from quasi linear scale spectra, the lead-
ing order of GFoG function is dominant over all other higher
order contributions. Thus the detailed functional form of
GFoG is not so important as far as the σv is assumed to be
undetermined. When (kµσv)2 (cid:28) 1, the leading order term

in H−1.

of Eq. (8) is dominant over all other higher orders, and the
estimated errors are immune from the exact functional form
of Eq. (8).

We now proceed to check if the FoG distortion eﬀects
the BAO peak position. In the table below we show the
derived distance measurements using models with various
σv choices, of 2, 5, 8, 11, 15 Mpc. The theoretical ξ(σ, π) is
presented in the bottom right panel of Fig. 3. It is diﬃcult
to ﬁnd the deviation from the ﬁgure. However, the measured
H−1 is possibly biased by a couple of percentage level. When
we consider the low resolution map such as BOSS, it would
not be much inﬂuential. But when we ﬁt the high resolution
experiment such as DESI, we have to marginalise FoG eﬀect.
For the measured DA, it is again immune from the FoG
eﬀect. The detailed results are presented below.

Note that the transverse distance is measured precisely,
regardless of the FoG eﬀect. In terms of DA, the BAO re-
mains as a standard ruler independent of the random ve-
locity eﬀect. However, the determination of radial distance
becomes uncertain due to the FoG. In the weak contami-
nation limit of σv (cid:46) 10 Mpc, the systematic uncertainty is
smaller than a couple of percent. When we consider a lower
resolution map such as the BOSS catalog, the BAO remains
as a standard ruler for the radial distance as well. However,
in the strong contamination limit, with σv (cid:38) 10 Mpc, the de-
termination of H−1 should not be trustable. We will discuss
this further in the following section.

3.5 Non–perturbative eﬀect from randomness of

peculiar velocity: Strong limit

The measured distances using the full RSD anisotropic anal-
ysis are signiﬁcantly contaminated by a systematic caused

cise theoretical prediction for FoG eﬀect on RSD clustering
is unknown, this contamination is marginalised through at
quasi linear scales in which the FoG can be parameterised by
a coeﬃcient at leading order. The coherent motion and H−1
are poorly determined by this systematic. In this work, we
measure distances using not the full RSD anisotropy analy-
sis, but the locations of the BAO in σ − π plane. The mea-
sured distances using BAO peak statistics are less contam-
inated by FoG eﬀect presented in the previous subsection.
This systematic is as invisible as others, if the dispersion of
random velocity is small and low resolution maps are used.
However, if the observed σv is exceeding the linear ve-
locity dispersion by a factor of 2, the radial BAO location is
inﬂuenced at a level of a couple of percent, while the trans-
verse BAO location is still immune from the FoG eﬀect. The
measured H−1 is biased by 2% and 4% levels at σv = 11 Mpc
and 15 Mpc respectively. In the future, H−1 is expected to
be measured within this precision level.

The variation of BAO peak locations is presented as
dotted curves in Fig.4 with diﬀerent σv = (2, 8, 11, 15) Mpc
from bottom to top. In the small σv limit about the lin-
ear velocity dispersion of σv = (2, 8) Mpc, the observed
D(µ) is nearly independent of the FoG systematic. In the
strong σv limit, much greater than linear velocity disper-
sion of σlin
v = 6 Mpc, the observed BAO peak locations at
µ → 1 starts to be biased at a level of several percent. The
dash curves represent a shift of the BAO peak location with
variation of H−1 at 1% and 4%, which presents an indis-
tinguishable signature from the case of σv variation. This
would suggest that we may only be able to make constraints
of the combined quantity σvH−1.

We investigate the detailed relation between the mea-
sured peak positions of D(µ) and the FoG parameter σv.
The D(µ) is given by the following ﬁtting formulation,

D(µ) = Df id(µ) + α(σv) + β(σv) µ2.

(11)

The observed curve of running D(µ) in Fig.4 is well repro-
duced by this formulation. The best ﬁts α(σv) and β(σv) are
given in the following table,

The shape of D(µ) running is quadrature for both vari-
ations of H−1 and σv in terms of µ, which causes the degen-
eracy between H−1 and σv. Then we will constrain just on
the combination of H−1 and σv.
But there is a possible way to break this degeneracy.
Although the patterns of ∆D(µ) with the variations of H−1
and σv are quadrature in terms of µ, both show a distinct
behaviours at µ → 0 limit. Whilst ∆D(µ) = 0 at µ → 0
with the variation of H−1, the α(σv) is non–trivial to lead

∆D(µ) (cid:54)= 0 at µ → 0. Thus, the radial distance H−1 can be
separately measured, after marginalising σv.

The observed α(σv) and β(σv) are presented in the
above table with diﬀerent cosmological models. We ﬁnd
that both parameters are weakly dependent on cosmology
models. Thus we will use this known formulation when we
marginalise the contamination by FoG systematic.

4 APPLICATION FOR CMASS CATALOGUE

OF BOSS DR11

The 2D anisotropy analysis has been applied for BOSS DR11
CMASS map in our previous work, to measure cosmic dis-
tances after marginalising the large scale clustering informa-
tion and the velocity randomness eﬀect. The improved RSD
theoretical model allows us to remove systematics at lin-
ear regime, and provides us with conservative, but trustable
result. The measured distances are DA = 1425.2+29.6−32.2 Mpc
and H−1 = 3223.6+203.4
−175.8 Mpc. The observed fractional er-
rors of DA and H−1 are 2% and 6% respectively, which is
poorer than prediction due to the conservative selection of
data. The current RSD theoretical model is not yet conﬁ-
dently improved at small scales, and the conservative cut-
oﬀ strategy removes information at s < 50 h−1 Mpc and
σ < 40 h−1 Mpc.

The methodology explained in this manuscript is less
dependent on RSD systematics, and no information is cut
oﬀ at any scale. We use 600 simulations produced for mock-
ing the BOSS DR11 CMASS (North sample) galaxies, and
compare the measured distances using BAO peaks with
DA and H−1 measurements using full 2D anisotropy anal-
ysis. The cosmology models for the simulations is ΛCDM
with ωb = 0.022, ωc = 0.12 and h = 0.67, which pro-
vides DA = 1395.18 Mpc and H−1 = 3234.76 Mpc of Planck
ΛCDM concordance model. The uncertainty due to galaxy
random motions is parametrised by one dimensional velocity
dispersion parameter σp, when the map is analysed using the
full 2D anisotropy method. The σp is signiﬁcantly degener-
ate with linear velocity growth function in linear regime, and
very poorly determined. The measured σp is 9.3+5.4−5.7 h Mpc−1
for BOSS DR11 CMASS. It is correspondent to the weak
FoG contamination limit, but there is possible impact on
the cosmic distance determination using out method, as it
is observed at the edge of weak FoG bound. In this section,
we exploit both weak and strong FoG contamination treat-
ments.

The simulations that we use are PTHALO mock galaxy
catalogs1 created by Manera et al. (2013), which are de-
signed to investigate the various systematics in the galaxy
sample from Data Release 11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscil-
lation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) (Schlegel et al. 2009;
Eisenstein et al. 2011; Anderson et al. 2012), referred to
as the “CMASS” galaxy sample. In constructing the mock
galaxy catalogs, (Manera et al. 2013) utilized second-order
Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) for the galaxy clus-
tering driven by gravity, which enables the creation of a

The directional coordinate µ is divided into 6 bins as deﬁned
in the previous section.

The covariance matrix of ξ among diﬀerent (k, µ) bins
is estimated using 600 mock catalogues. This number of re-
alisations exceeds the number of (k, µ) bins of 84, which
provides us with a stable inverse matrix. Using the correla-
tion function computed from each of the 600 mock catalogs,
we estimate the covariance matrix as

tion. The mocks catalogs constitute 600 density ﬁeld realiza-
tions which span the redshift range of the observed galaxies
in our sample i.e. 0.43 < z < 0.7. Each catalog contains
∼ 7 × 105 galaxies, 90% of which are central galaxies resid-
ing in dark matter halos of ∼ 1013h−1M(cid:12).

4.1 Cosmic distances at weak FoG limit

The 2D correlation function ξ(σ, π) is calculated for the sim-
ulations as described in Eq. 3, and the averages of ξ(σ, π)
at the given σ and π bins are derived using 600 realisa-
tions. The means of ξ(σ, π) are transformed into correla-
tion function ξ(s, µ). The radial coordinate bin is given at
80 Mpc < s < 180 Mpc with spacing ∆s = 7 Mpc which en-

where N = 600, ξk(ri) represents the value of the correlation
function of ith bin of (σ, π) in kth realization, and ξ(ri) is the
mean value of ξk(r i) over realizations. We can then obtain
the correlation matrix as

The inverse of Cij is well deﬁned and thus does not require
any de-noising procedures e.g. singular value decomposition.
The parameters in Eq. 4 in all 6 µ bins are ﬁtted simulta-
neously using this full covariance matrix.

However, the covariance matrix estimated from a ﬁnite
number monte carlo realisations has been shown to be biased
(Hartlap et al. (2007), see also Kazin et al. (2013); Percival
et al. (2014)). An unbiased covariance matrix C, can be ob-
tained by multiply the original covariance ˆC by a correction

puted using the full covariance of Cij. The BAO peak loca-
tions for all wedge correlation functions appear consistent
with each other, and they are found using the same ﬁtting
formulation in Eq. 4.

We analyse the measured wedge points in Fig. 5, and
determine the transverse and radial BAO characteristic
scales as D⊥ = 155.5+7.9−7.9 Mpc and D|| = 154.8+4.2−4.8 Mpc.
These measurements are transformed into cosmic distances
DA = 1400.2+38.4−43.8 Mpc and H−1 = 3263.4+165.4
−165.4 Mpc. The
transverse and radial cosmic distances are estimated with
about 3% and 5% fractional errors, respectively. Both errors
are nearly equivalent to the observed fractional errors for
real BOSS CMASS catalogue, of which cosmic distances are
computed using the full anisotropy analysis. This methodol-
ogy provides remarkable precision for cosmic distance deter-
mination using BAO peaks only, considering that only the
measured correlation points around the BAO peak location
are exploited.

4.2 Correction using FoG contamination

treatment

The dashed curves in the left and right panels of Fig. 6
represent the the relative likelihood functions. The ﬁdu-
cial cosmic distances are shown as solid vertical lines in
both panels, which are well enclosed within those likeli-
hood function. We compare the measured transverse dis-
tance DA = 1400.2 Mpc with the ﬁducial one 1395.2 Mpc.
The measurement is biased by ∆DA = 5 Mpc which is cor-
respondent to 12% deviation against 1–σ deviation for DA,
which is not considered to be signiﬁcant. But the observed
bias for the radial distance is ∆H−1 = 28.6 Mpc which is
about 17% oﬀ-set against the 1–σ deviation for H−1.
We are interested in understanding any possible sys-
tematic for measuring H−1 using our method, despite the
small deviation to be ignored. As the more signiﬁcant bias
is observed in the radial direction, it can be caused by FoG
contamination. The galaxies in BOSS CMASS catalogues
are not expected in the strong FoG regime, but the mea-
sured σv from the full anisotropy analysis is placed in the
boundary between weak and strong FoG regimes. There-
fore, it would be interesting to apply our FoG contamination
treatment, and present the measured cosmic distance after
marginalising FoG systematic. The measurements are pre-
sented as solid curves in Fig. 6. The dark and light shaded re-
gions represent 65% and 95% conﬁdence levels respectively.
The measured transverse distance is DA = 1397.044.3
33.2 Mpc of
which deviation from the ﬁducial value is ∆DA = 1.8 Mpc.
It is biased only 4% against the 1–σ deviation of DA. The
measured radial distance is H−1 = 3217.5+179.9
−154.2 Mpc, and
∆H−1 = 17.3 Mpc which is only 10% deviation from the 1–
σ deviation of H−1. This correction is represent as the solid
curves in Fig. 6. After accounting for he FoG systematic, the
results are improved signiﬁcantly.
In Fig. 7 we show the 1 and 2-σ error bounds on DA and
H−1 for the marginalised σv case (solid lines and blue shaded
region) and the ﬁxed FoG case, σv = 0 (dashed contours).
The grey shaded regions are results obtained from Song et al.
(2014) using the full anisotropic correlation function of the
BOSS DR11 CMASS catalogue, which we include for a com-
parison of the size of the constraints only as the mean values

need not be consistent. We ﬁnd that the containing power of
our methodology is are consistent with other works based on
the full shape of the anisotropic clustering. For instance in
Anderson et al. (2014) using the power spectrum and corre-
lation function with the reconstruction method recover DA
to 1.4% precision compared to our result of 2.8% and they
ﬁnd H−1 with 3.4% precision to compared to our 5.3%. Al-
though our constraints are slightly larger the methodology
we use is quite strictly model independent and fairly straight
forward to implement.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In our analysis we have focused on the large scale cluster-
ing of galaxies in an attempt to immunise ourselves from
the uncertainty in small-scale non-linear physics. Thus we
have chosen to work in the range 80-180 Mpc. Since work-
ing in these large scales, our clustering statistics carry little
information of the growth of structure and this was indeed
our aim as we concentrate on maximising the information
gained from the Alcock-Paczynski geometrical distortions.

We have investigated the sensitivity of the shape of the
BAO ring to various systematics. We ﬁnd that the shape
of the BAO ring is invariant to galaxy bias and unknown
shape change in the primordial power spectrum. However
non-linearities in the density ﬁeld and non-linear FoG dis-
tortions contaminate the estimated BAO scales and thus the
recovered values of DA and H−1. Fortunately, the contami-
nation of the FoG eﬀect is not perfectly degenerate with the
geometrical distortions and thus in future sub-percent level
precision experiments the two eﬀects can be disentangled.
Thus we hope in that future measurements will allow us to
focus on measurements of the AP eﬀect and to infer cosmo-
logical parameters pertaining to the expansion history.

Cristiano G. Sabiu, Yong-Seon Song

Using mock data comparable with the BOSS DR11
CMASS catalogue we show that we can obtain constraints
on DA and H−1 at the level of ∼ 3% and ∼ 5% respectively.
We tested our methodology using mock galaxy catalogs and
found that we can recover the input cosmology to a level of
precision, competitive with other results in the literature. In
future work we plan to further test and apply the method-
ology we have developed here to the observational data of
SDSS BOSS (Oh et al. 2016).
