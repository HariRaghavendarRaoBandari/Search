PERMUTATION POLYNOMIALS OF THE FORM

X + γ Tr(X k)

GOHAR KYUREGHYAN AND MICHAEL E. ZIEVE

1. Introduction

Let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of size q, and let p be the characteristic
of Fq. A permutation polynomial over Fq is a polynomial F (X) ∈
Fq[X] for which the induced function x (cid:55)→ f (x) is a permutation of
Fq. Permutation polynomials are used in various applications of ﬁnite
ﬁelds, where special importance is attached to permutation polynomials
which have few terms. Due in part to this, and also due to the intrinsic
interest of the problem, the study of permutation polynomials with few
terms has thrived for well over a century. In this paper we make a new
contribution to this topic by analyzing permutation polynomials of the
form X + γ Trqn/q(X k) where n and k are positive integers, γ ∈ F∗
qn,
and Trqn/q(X) := X qn−1 + X qn−2 +··· + X q + X (so that Trqn/q induces
the trace map from Fqn to Fq). We produce the following families of
permutation polynomials:
Theorem 1.1. The polynomial X +γ Trqn/q(X k) is a permutation poly-
nomial over Fqn in each of the following cases:

(a): n = 2, q ≡ ±1 (mod 6), γ = −1/3, k = 2q − 1
(b): n = 2, q ≡ 5 (mod 6), γ3 = −1/27, k = 2q − 1
(c): n = 2, q ≡ 1 (mod 3), γ = 1, k = (q2 + q + 1)/3
(d): n = 2, q ≡ 1 (mod 4), (2γ)(q+1)/2 = 1, k = (q + 1)2/4
(e): n = 2, q = Q2, Q > 0 odd, γ = −1, k = Q3 − Q + 1
(f ): n = 2, q = Q2, Q > 0 odd, γ = −1, k = Q3 + Q2 − Q
(g): n = 3, q odd, γ = 1, k = (q2 + 1)/2
(h): n = 3, q odd, γ = −1/2, k = q2 − q + 1
(i): n = 2(cid:96)r, γq2(cid:96)−1 = −1, k = q(cid:96) + 1 for some positive integers (cid:96)

and r.

We remark that “at random” one would not expect there to be per-
mutation polynomials of the form X + γ Trqn/q(X k) over Fqn when
Q := qn is suﬃciently large and γ ∈ F∗
Q, since the polynomials of this

form induce fewer than Q2 distinct functions on FQ while the propor-
tion of permutations amongst all functions FQ → FQ is Q!/QQ. Hence
it seems that any inﬁnite sequence of examples such as those in The-
orem 1.1 should exist for some “good reason”, and it is an interesting
challenge to understand the diﬀerent sorts of reasons which can account
for such unexpected examples to occur.

1X on the nonsquares in µq+1 and c2

An intriguing feature of the present paper is that we need several
diﬀerent methods in order to prove the various cases of Theorem 1.1.
In cases (a)–(d) and (g) we use a well-known result (Proposition 2.2)
asserting that Xh(X q−1) permutes Fqn if and only if Xh(X)q−1 per-
mutes the set µ(qn−1)/(q−1) of (qn− 1)/(q− 1)-th roots of unity. We then
reformulate the latter condition in a simpler way (see Proposition 2.4),
so that cases (a) and (b) boil down to showing that a certain degree-3
rational function permutes µq+1, and case (c) boils down to showing
that a certain power map X N permutes µq+1. Case (d) is more in-
teresting, since we wind up showing that Xh(X)q−1 permutes µq+1 by
2X N on the
showing that it acts as c2
squares, for certain elements c1, c2 ∈ µq+1; in this case it seems com-
plicated to analyze Xh(X)q−1 at once on all elements of µq+1, rather
than treating the squares and nonsquares separately. In case (g) we
use a double application of Proposition 2.2, by ﬁrst saying that the
given polynomial permutes Fq3 if and only if a certain associated poly-
nomial permutes µq2+q+1, then composing the associated polynomial
with certain power maps X N which permute µq2+q+1, and then reduc-
ing the composition mod X q2+q+1 − 1 to obtain a polynomial which
(again by Proposition 2.2) permutes µq2+q+1 if and only if a certain
additive polynomial permutes Fq3; we then ﬁnish the proof by directly
verifying this last bijectivity. This kind of approach does not seem to
work in cases (e) and (f), so for these cases we use a variant of Dob-
bertin’s method [3], which involves computing Gr¨obner bases of several
ideals in a multivariate polynomial ring. This variant involves new fea-
tures compared to previous applications of Dobbertin’s approach, and
may be of independent interest. We prove case (h) by composing with
certain bijective power maps and additive polynomials to obtain a func-
tion which permutes both the squares and the nonsquares in Fq3; this
method was inspired by the notion of aﬃne equivalence of planar func-
tions. Finally, in case (i) we use an additive analogue of Proposition 2.2
(see Proposition 2.1) in order to show that the stated polynomial per-
mutes Fqn if and only if certain associated polynomials permute Fq,
and we calculate that each of these associated polynomials induces the
same function on Fq as does X + c for some c ∈ Fq.

We computed all permutation polynomials over ﬁelds Fqn of the form
X + γ Trqn/q(X k) with γ ∈ F∗
qn, q odd, n > 1, and qn < 5000. Here the
hypothesis n > 1 is needed to distinguish our study from that of permu-
tation binomials. It is easy to see that, for ﬁxed q, n, γ, we can replace
k by qk or by k + qn − 1 without aﬀecting whether X + γ Trqn/q(X k)
permutes Fqn. Modulo this equivalence, the only permutation polyno-
mials arising in our computation which are not listed in Theorem 1.1
are:

• Cases with k = pi, where the polynomial is automatically a
member of the much-studied class of additive permutation poly-
nomials.
• Cases with p | n and (qn−1) | k(qn/p−1), where the polynomial
induces the identity map on Fqn.
• q = 7, n = 2, k = 10, γ4 = 1
• q = 9, n = 2, k = 33, γ2 − γ = 1
• q = 27, n = 2, k = 261, (γ − 1)13 = γ13
• q = 9, n = 3, k ∈ {11, 19, 33, 57}, γ4 = −1
• q = 49, n = 2, k = 385, γ5 = −1.

Thus, it seems that Theorem 1.1 may explain the bulk of all permuta-
tion polynomials of this form, so long as we exclude the simple cases
where the polynomial is additive or induces the identity map.

Permutation polynomials of the form X + γ Trqn/q(X k) were studied
in [1, 2]. All examples in those papers had the special feature that γ
is a linear translator of f (X) := Trqn/q(X k), in the sense that there is
some δ ∈ Fq for which

f (x + uγ) − f (x) = uδ

for all x ∈ Fqn and u ∈ Fq. This property is satisﬁed (with δ = 0) for
the polynomials in case (i) of Theorem 1.1, as we show in Remark 10.2.
However, the permutation polynomials in cases (a)–(h) of Theorem 1.1
are of a diﬀerent nature, since for these polynomials γ is not a linear
translator of Trqn/q(X k).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove some general
properties about maps of the form X + γ Trqn/q(X k). Then in Sections
3–10 we prove Theorem 1.1 in each of cases (a)–(i). In addition, we
note that Theorems 3.1, 6.1, 7.1 and 9.1 list further families of sparse
rational functions which permute either a ﬁnite ﬁeld or a group of roots
of unity in a ﬁnite ﬁeld.

2. General remarks and equivalent statements

We begin with two propositions which reformulate the condition that
X + γ Trqn/q(X k) should permute Fqn in terms of properties of some
associated functions on Fq. These reformulations play a crucial role in
our proof of Theorem 1.1. In fact the reformulations apply to a more
general class of functions.
Proposition 2.1. For any function f : Fqn → Fq with n ≥ 2, and any
γ ∈ F∗

qn, the following three statements are equivalent:
(a): The map F : x (cid:55)→ x + γ · f (x) is bijective on Fqn.
(b): For each α ∈ Fqn the map x (cid:55)→ x + f (α + γ · x) is bijective
(c): For each α ∈ Fqn there is a unique x ∈ Fq for which x +

on Fq.
f (α + γ · x) = 0.

Proof. For each α ∈ Fqn, the function F maps the line α + γ Fq into
itself, so that F permutes Fqn if and only if F induces a permutation
on each such line. Explicitly, for u ∈ Fq we have

F (α + γ u) = α + γ(u + f (α + γ u)),

so that F permutes the line α + γ Fq if and only if the function u (cid:55)→
u + f (α + γ u) permutes Fq. Thus (a) and (b) are equivalent. Since (b)
immediately implies (c), it remains only to show that (c) implies (b), or
equivalently that if (b) did not hold then (c) would not hold. So suppose
there is some α(cid:48) ∈ Fqn for which the function x (cid:55)→ x + f (α(cid:48) + γ · x) is
not bijective on Fq. Then there are distinct elements u1, u2 ∈ Fq which
have the same image y under this function. Hence for i = 1, 2 we have

y = ui + f (α(cid:48) + γ · ui),

or equivalently

(ui − y) + f (α(cid:48) + γ · (ui − y) + γy) = 0.

Thus xi := ui − y satisﬁes xi + f (α(cid:48) + γy + γxi) = 0; since x1 and
x2 are distinct elements of Fq, this contradicts (c) for the value α :=
(cid:3)
α(cid:48) + yγ.

The next result is a special case of [6, Lemma 2.1].

Proposition 2.2. For any h(X) ∈ Fqn[X], the polynomial Xh(X q−1)
permutes Fqn if and only if Xh(X)q−1 permutes the set of (qn− 1)/(q−
1)-th roots of unity in F∗
qn.

We now give further reformulations in case n = 2.

Proposition 2.3. Let γ, ω ∈ Fq2 be linearly independent over Fq, and
let f : Fq2 → Fq be a function satisfying f (u · x) = u · f (x) for each
u ∈ Fq and x ∈ Fq2. Then x (cid:55)→ x + γ · f (x) permutes Fq2 if and only
if f (γ) (cid:54)= −1 and x (cid:55)→ x + f (ω + γx) permutes Fq.
Proof. By Proposition 2.1, x (cid:55)→ x + γ · f (x) permutes Fq2 if and only if
Fα : x (cid:55)→ x + f (α + γ · x) permutes Fq for each α ∈ Fq2. The elements
α ∈ Fq2 are precisely the elements α := u · γ + v · ω with u, v ∈ Fq, so
we treat each choice of u, v in turn. If v = 0 then for x ∈ Fq we have
Fα(x) = x + f ((u + x)γ) = x + (u + x)f (γ) = (1 + f (γ)) x + uf (γ),
so that Fα permutes Fq if and only if f (γ) (cid:54)= −1. If v (cid:54)= 0 then for
x ∈ Fq we have

Fα(x) = x + f (vω + (u + x)γ) = v

so that Fα permutes Fq if and only if x (cid:55)→ x + f (ω + (x + u
v )γ) permutes
Fq, or equivalently x (cid:55)→ x + f (ω + xγ) permutes Fq.
(cid:3)
Proposition 2.4. Let k := (q − 1)N + 1 for some integer N ≥ 0,
and pick any γ ∈ F∗
q2. Then the polynomial F (X) := X + γ Trq2/q(X k)
permutes Fq2 if and only if

H(X) :=

X N + γq(1 + X 2N−1)
X N−1 + γ(X 2N−1 + 1)

permutes the set µq+1 of (q + 1)-th roots of unity in F∗
q2, or equivalently
this rational function is injective on µq+1 and its denominator has no
roots in µq+1.
Proof. By Proposition 2.2, F (X) permutes Fq2 if and only if

permutes µq+1. For any x ∈ µq+1 such that G(x) (cid:54)= 0, we have

G(X) := X(cid:0)1 + γ(X N + X qN +1)(cid:1)q−1
=(cid:0)1 + γ(xN + xqN +1)(cid:1)q−1

Therefore G(X) permutes µq+1 if and only if H(X) permutes µq+1.
Finally, if the denominator of H(X) has no roots in µq+1 then the
above computation shows that G and H agree on µq+1, and thus
H(µq+1) = G(µq+1) ⊆ µq+1, so that bijectivity of H on µq+1 follows
(cid:3)
from injectivity.

3. The case that n = 2 and k = 2q − 1

In this section we prove cases (a) and (b) of Theorem 1.1. We begin
with a proof of (a), which also produces some degree-3 rational func-
tions which permute Fq, as well as some degree-3 rational functions
which permute the set µq+1 of (q + 1)-th roots of unity in F∗
q2.
Theorem 3.1. If gcd(q, 6) = 1 then the following are true:

(a): F1(X) := X − 1
3
(b): For any nonsquare ν ∈ Fq, the function

Trq2/q(X 2q−1) permutes Fq2.

X(X 2 − 9ν)

X 2 − ν

per-

mutes Fq.
(c): g(X) :=

X 3 − 3X 2 + 1
X 3 − 3X + 1

permutes µq+1.

Proof. First we show that (a) and (b) are equivalent. Pick ω ∈ Fq2
with ωq = −ω (cid:54)= 0. Then ω and −1/3 are linearly independent over
Fq. We apply Proposition 2.3 with γ = − 1
3 and f (X) := Trq2/q(X 2q−1),
noting that f (a · x) = a · f (x) for a ∈ Fq and x ∈ Fq2 since 2q − 1 ≡ 1
(mod q − 1). Since f (− 1
3 (cid:54)= −1, it follows that (a) holds if and
only if

3) = − 2

(cid:0)(ω − 1

h(X) := X + Trq2/q

Since the above equivalence holds for each ω with ωq = −ω (cid:54)= 0, and the
set of all corresponding values ω2 coincides with the set of nonsquares
in Fq, this shows that (a) and (b) are equivalent. The equivalence of
(a) and (c) follows from Proposition 2.4 with N = 2 and γ = − 1
3. So
it is enough to verify (c). By Proposition 2.4, it suﬃces to show that

PERMUTATION POLYNOMIALS

g is both well-deﬁned and injective on µq+1. If some α ∈ µq+1 is a root
of r(X) := X 3 − 3X + 1, then also αq is a root of r(X); since neither 1
nor −1 is a root of r(X), it follows that α (cid:54)= αq. Since the product of
the roots of r(X) is −1, the third root of r(X) must be −1/αq+1 = −1,
which is not the case since r(−1) (cid:54)= 0. Thus g is well-deﬁned on µq+1.
The numerator of g(X) − g(Y ) is

(X 3 − 3X 2 + 1)(Y 3 − 3Y + 1) − (Y 3 − 3Y 2 + 1)(X 3 − 3X + 1)

= 3(X − Y )(XY − X + 1)(XY − Y + 1).

Hence if g(α) = g(β) for some distinct α, β ∈ µq+1 then αβ ∈ {α −
1, β− 1}. Assume without loss that αβ = α− 1, so that (α− 1)q+1 = 1.
But

(α − 1)q+1 = αq+1 − αq − α + 1 = 2 − 1

so that α + 1

(cid:3)

We now show that the permutation property of the polynomials in
case (b) of Theorem 1.1 follows at once from the analogous property
in case (a).
Theorem 3.2. If q ≡ 5 (mod 6) and γ ∈ Fq2 satisﬁes γ3 = − 1

27, then

F2(X) := X + γ Trq2/q(X 2q−1)

permutes Fq2.
Proof. Since ω := −3γ satisﬁes ω3 = 1, we have ω2q−1 = 1 and thus

F2(ωX) = ωX − 1
3

= ω(cid:0)X − 1

ω Trq2/q(ω2q−1X 2q−1)

Trq2/q(X 2q−1)(cid:1),

so the result follows from Theorem 3.1.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. A diﬀerent proof of bijectivity of F1 was given in the
recent paper [4].

4. The case that n = 2 and k = (q2 + q + 1)/3

We now prove case (c) of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 4.1. If q ≡ 1 (mod 3), then

F3(X) := X + Trq2/q(X (q2+q+1)/3)

permutes Fq2.

8

GOHAR KYUREGHYAN AND MICHAEL E. ZIEVE

Proof. By Proposition 2.4 with N = q+2

3 , it suﬃces to show that

g(X) :=

X N + 1 + X 2N−1
X N−1 + X 2N−1 + 1

permutes µq+1. Here 3N ≡ 1 (mod q + 1), so by putting Y = X N our
condition becomes that

Y + 1 + 1
Y
1
Y 2 + 1
Y + 1

should permute µq+1. This function is the identity function y (cid:55)→ y so
long as µq+1 contains no roots of Y 2 + Y + 1, which is the case since
those roots have order 3. Hence g(X) induces the same function on
(cid:3)
µq+1 as does X N , so that g permutes µq+1.

5. The case that n = 2 and k = (q + 1)2/4

We now prove case (d) of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 5.1. Let q ≡ 1 (mod 4), and let γ ∈ Fq2 satisfy (2γ)(q+1)/2 =
1. Then

F4(X) := X + γ Trq2/q(X (q+1)2/4)

permutes Fq2.
Proof. By Proposition 2.2, it suﬃces to show that

g(X) := X(γ−1 + X N + X qN +1)q−1

induces a bijection on µq+1 in case N = q+3
4 . Note that every element
of µq+1 can be written in exactly one way as ±y2 with y ∈ µ(q+1)/2. By
hypothesis 2γ is a square in µq+1, so that −2γ is a nonsquare in µq+1,
and thus γ−1 + 2y is nonzero for each y ∈ µ(q+1)/2. For y ∈ µ(q+1)/2 we
compute

(y2)N = y(q+3)/2 = y and (y2)qN +1 = yq+2 = y

so that

and

g(−y2) = −y2(γ−1 + y(−1)N + y(−1)qN +1)q−1

= −y2γ1−q = −(2yγ)2,

g(y2) = y2(γ−1 + y + y)q−1 = y2 (γ−1 + 2y)q
γ−1 + 2y

= y2 4γ + 2y−1
γ−1 + 2y

= 2γy.

PERMUTATION POLYNOMIALS

Since 2γ is in µ(q+1)/2, and squaring is a bijective map on µ(q+1)/2, it
follows that g induces a bijection on µ(q+1)/2 and also a bijection on
−µ(q+1)/2, so that g induces a bijection on µq+1 as desired.
(cid:3)
Remark 5.2. In fact, the polynomial F4 ﬁxes each nonsquare in Fq2.
Moreover, we have

F4(x) =

x + 2γ · x
x

(q+1)2

4

if x is a square in Fq2
if x is a nonsquare in Fq2.

(cid:40)

To see this, note that for any x ∈ Fq2 the element x(q2−1)/4 is either
zero or a fourth root of unity, and since q ≡ 1 (mod 4) it follows that
x(q2−1)/4 lies in the subﬁeld Fq. Thus for x ∈ Fq2 we have

F4(x) = x + γ Trq2/q(x

6. The case that n = 2 and q = Q2 where Q is an odd prime

power and k = Q3 − Q + 1

In this section we prove case (e) of Theorem 1.1, by showing that

F5(X) := X − TrQ4/Q2(X Q3−Q+1)

is a permutation on FQ4, when Q is an odd prime power. Our proof
relies on a variant of Dobbertin’s method [3]. We also exhibit certain
sparse rational functions which permute either FQ2 or the set of (Q2+1)-
th roots of unity in F∗

Q4.

Theorem 6.1. For any odd prime power Q, we have:

(a): F5(X) = X − TrQ4/Q2(X Q3−Q+1) permutes FQ4.

X Q+2 + 3νX Q + 4ν(Q+1)/2X

GOHAR KYUREGHYAN AND MICHAEL E. ZIEVE

We begin with some simple lemmas about the preimages under F5

of some special values.
Lemma 6.2. The only root of F5(X) in FQ4 is 0.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that x ∈ F∗

Q4 is a root of F5. Then

xQ3−Q + x−Q3+Q2+Q−1 = 1,
and y := xQ2−1 is an element of µQ2+1 satisfying
(6.3)
In particular, y cannot be ±1. Since yQ2 = 1/y, we obtain
y−1 + yQ+1 = (yQ + y1−Q)Q = 1Q = 1Q3 = (yQ + y1−Q)Q3 = y + y−Q−1,
or equivalently

yQ + y1−Q = 1.

(yQ+2 + 1) · (yQ − 1) = 0.

Since y (cid:54)= 1, we obtain yQ+2 = −1, so that y2Q+4 = 1. Hence the order
of y divides

gcd(2Q + 4, Q2 + 1) = 2 gcd(Q + 2, Q2 + 1) = 2 gcd(Q + 2, 5),

so that y10 = 1. Since yQ+2 = −1, it follows that y5 = −1. Now (6.3)
simpliﬁes to

−y−2 − y3 = 1,

and since y5 = −1 this yields the contradiction 0 = 1.
(cid:3)
Lemma 6.4. The set S of elements x ∈ F∗
Q4 for which x2Q2 − xQ2+1 +
x2 = 0 is nonempty only when 3 | Q, in which case S consists of the
(Q2 − 1)-th roots of −1 and F5 ﬁxes each element of S.
Proof. Write u := xQ2−1 with x ∈ S, so that uQ2+1 = 1 (since plainly
x (cid:54)= 0). If 3 (cid:45) Q then the equation u2 − u + 1 = 0 implies that u is
a primitive sixth root of unity, which is impossible since 6 (cid:45) (Q2 + 1).
Hence 3 | Q, so that X 2Q2 − X Q2+1 + X 2 = (X Q2 + X)2 and thus
S consists of the (Q2 − 1)-th roots of −1. Therefore for x ∈ S and
k := Q3−Q+1 we have F5(x) = x−xk−xQ2k = x−xk−(−x)k = x. (cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 6.1. Write q := Q2. The equivalence of (a), (b) and
(c) follows from Propositions 2.3 and 2.4 in the same manner as in
our previous results. In the remainder of the proof we show that F5 is
bijective on FQ4. In light of Lemma 6.2, it suﬃces to show that each
d ∈ F∗

Q4 has at most one preimage x in F∗
Q4.

Pick any d in F∗

Q4, and write

e := dQ, f := dQ2, g := dQ3.

Let x be an element of F∗

Q4 for which F5(x) = d, and write

y := xQ, z := xQ2, w := xQ3.

The equations F5(xQi) = dQi for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 may be written as

By Lemma 6.4, if the set S := {u ∈ FQ4 : u2Q2 − uQ2+1 + u2 = 0} is
nonempty then 3 | Q and S consists of the (Q2−1)-th roots of −1, each
of which is ﬁxed by F5. We claim that if d ∈ S then x ∈ S. For, if d ∈ S
then 3 | Q and f = −d, so that the sum of the left sides of (6.5) and
(6.7) is zero. The numerator of this sum factors as (w + y)(wx + zy),
so we must have either w = −y or wx = −zy.
If w = −y then
yQ2−1 = −1, so that y ∈ S and hence x = yQ3 ∈ S. If wx = −zy then
(yz)Q2−1 = −1, so that y(Q+1)(Q2−1) = −1; but since y ∈ F∗
Q4 it follows
that the order of y divides gcd(2(Q + 1)(Q2 − 1), Q4 − 1) = 2(Q2 − 1),
so that y(Q+1)(Q2−1) = 1 (cid:54)= −1, a contradiction. Thus if d ∈ S then
x ∈ S.
Q4\S into itself, it
remains to show that each d ∈ T has at most one preimage in T under
F5. Thus we assume henceforth that d, x ∈ T , so that f 2 − df − d2 (cid:54)= 0
and z2−xz+x2 (cid:54)= 0, and raising to the Q-th power yields g2−eg−e2 (cid:54)= 0
and w2 − yw + y2 (cid:54)= 0. Since z (cid:54)= 0 we can use (6.6) to solve for w,
obtaining

Since F5 ﬁxes every element of S, and maps T := F∗

Substituting (6.9) into (6.8) and simplifying yields

Substituting (6.9) and (6.10) into (6.5) and (6.7) yields A, B ∈
FQ4(X, Z) such that A(x, z) = B(x, z) = 0. Now compute a Gr¨obner
basis for the ideal of FQ4[Z(cid:48), X(cid:48), V (cid:48), Z, X] generated by the numerators
of A(X, Z) and B(X, Z) as well as the elements ZZ(cid:48) − 1, XX(cid:48) − 1 and
(X 2 − XZ + Z 2)V (cid:48) − 1. Since each element of this ideal vanishes when

and C(x) = 0 for a certain degree-5 polynomial C(X) ∈ FQ4[X].
Suppose that x(cid:48) ∈ T \ {x} satisﬁes F5(x(cid:48)) = F5(x); then we must
have C(x(cid:48)) = 0. The coeﬃcients of C(X) are rational functions in
d, e, f, g; by using (6.5)–(6.8) we may replace these by rational functions
in x, y, z, w, and after multiplying by a suitable polynomial in x, y, z, w
we can rewrite the resulting polynomial as (X − x)D(X)E(X) where
D(X) := yw(x2 − xz + z2)X 2 + xyz(y − w)(x − z)2

+ (z − x)(x2yw + xy2z − xyzw − xzw2 + yz2w)X

E(X) := (x2y2 − xyzw + z2w2)X 2 + wz(y − w)(x − z)3

+ (z − x)(x2yw + xy2z − xyzw − xzw2 − yz2w + 2z2w2)X.

Hence x(cid:48) is a root of at least one of D(X) and E(X). We must have
z (cid:54)= x (and equivalently w (cid:54)= y), since otherwise D(X) = x2y2X 2 =
E(X), which is impossible since x(cid:48) is a nonzero root of one of these
polynomials. Also x2y2 − xyzw + z2w2 (cid:54)= 0, since otherwise (xy)2 −
(xy)Q2+1 + (xy)2Q2 = 0 so that (xy)Q2−1 = −1, but then the order of x
divides both 2(Q + 1)(Q2 − 1) and Q4 − 1 and hence divides 2(Q2 − 1),
which yields the contradiction (xy)Q2−1 = 1 (cid:54)= −1. Thus both D and
E have degree 2.
If D(x(cid:48)) = 0 then D(x(cid:48))Q = 0, so that (x(cid:48))Q is a root of the poly-
nomial D2(X) obtained from D(X) by replacing each coeﬃcient by its
Q-th power. Equations (6.10) and (6.11) imply that y = G(x) where

G(X) := −(X − d + f )

e(d − f ) + g(X − d + f )

X 2 + (X − d + f )2 − X(X − d + f )

.

Since these equations were deduced from the identity F5(x) = d, it
follows that (x(cid:48))Q = G(x(cid:48)), so that x(cid:48) is a root of the numerator of
D2(G(X)). This numerator factors as E(X)H(X) where
H(X) := (x2y2 − xy2z + xyzw − xzw2 + z2w2)X 2 + x2y(x − z)2(y − w)
+ (z − x)(2x2y2 − x2yw − xy2z + xyzw − xzw2 + yz2w)X.
Thus x(cid:48) is a root of at least one of E(X) and H(X). If E(x(cid:48)) = 0 then
x(cid:48) is a common root of D(X) and E(X), so the resultant of D(X) and
E(X) must vanish. This resultant equals −xz(x − z)4(y − w)2(x2y2 −
xyzw + z2w2)uQ+1 where

u := x2y2 − x2yw + xyzw − yz2w + z2w2,

PERMUTATION POLYNOMIALS

13

so we must have u = 0. But then a routine computation shows that
D(X) = yw(x2 − xz + z2)(X − x)2, which yields the contradiction
x(cid:48) = x. Thus if D(x(cid:48)) = 0 then we must have H(x(cid:48)) = 0. If H has
degree 2 then as above the resultant of D(X) and H(X) must vanish,
so that

0 = xyzw(x − z)6(y − w)2(x2y2 − xyzw + z2w2)Q+1,

which we know is false. Thus deg H < 2. Since the constant term of
H(X) is nonzero, the condition H(x(cid:48)) = 0 forces deg H = 1, so the
resultant of D(X) and H(X) is xy(x − z)4(w − y)v where
v := x5y3w − 2x4y4z + x4y3zw − 2x4y2zw2 + 3x3y4z2 − 3x3y3z2w

+ 6x3y2z2w2 − 2x3yz2w3 + x3z2w4 − x2y4z3 − 2x2y3z3w − x2y2z3w2
− x2z3w4 + 2xy3z4w − xy2z4w2 + 2xyz4w3 − y2z5w2.

Thus we must have v = 0, and also the coeﬃcient of X 2 in H(X)
must vanish. But we can express yz6w2(y − w)3(y2 + w2) as a sum
of the products of these two quantities with certain polynomials in
x, y, z, w, so that this expression vanishes and thus y2 = −w2, whence
y2Q2−2 = −1. However, there are no (2Q2 − 2)-th roots of −1 in F∗
Q4,
since 2Q2− 2 is divisible by the largest power of 2 which divides Q4− 1.
This completes the proof when D(x(cid:48)) = 0, and the proof when
(cid:3)
E(x(cid:48)) = 0 is similar.

7. The case that n = 2 and q = Q2 where Q is an odd prime

power and k = Q3 + Q2 − Q

Case (f) of Theorem 1.1 is contained in the following result.

Theorem 7.1. For any odd prime power Q, we have:

(a): F6(X) := X − TrQ4/Q2(X Q3+Q2−Q) permutes FQ4.

X Q+2 + 3νX Q − 4ν(Q+1)/2X

permutes the set of (Q2 + 1)-th roots of

We note that assertions (b) and (c) of this result are extremely similar
to the corresponding assertions in Theorem 6.1. However, we have
not been able to ﬁnd a direct proof that these similar assertions are
logically equivalent to one another. If we could ﬁnd such a proof, then
Theorem 7.1 would follow from Theorem 6.1. At present, the best we

14

GOHAR KYUREGHYAN AND MICHAEL E. ZIEVE

can do is to prove Theorem 7.1 via a similar argument to our proof of
Theorem 6.1.

Proof. The equivalence of (a), (b) and (c) follows from Propositions 2.3
and 2.4 in the same manner as in our previous results. The proof of
assertion (a) is nearly identical to the proof of assertion (a) in Theo-
(cid:3)
rem 6.1, so the details can safely be left to the reader.

8. The case that n = 3 and k = (q2 + 1)/2

We now prove case (g) of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 8.1. If q is odd, then

F7(X) := X + Trq3/q

(cid:0)X

2 (cid:1)

q2+1

permutes Fq3.
Proof. By Proposition 2.2, it suﬃces to show that

g(X) := X(1 + X (q+1)/2 + X (q2+q+2)/2 + X (q2+2)(q+1)/2)q−1
permutes the set µq2+q+1 of (q2 + q + 1)-th roots of unity in F∗
x ∈ µq2+q+1 we compute

q3. For

g(x2q) = x2q (1 + x−1 + xq + xq−1)q−1
= x2q · (1 + x−1)q−1 · (1 + xq)q−1
= xq2+q · (1 + x−1)q2−1 = x−1(1 + x−1)q2−1,

so that (since 1 + x−1 (cid:54)= 0)

g(x2q)−q = xq(1 + x−1)−1+q = x(x + 1)q−1.

Again by Proposition 2.2, X(X + 1)q−1 permutes µq2+q+1 if and only if
X q + X permutes Fq3, which is indeed the case since X q + X is an ad-
ditive polynomial having no nonzero roots in Fq3. Therefore g(X 2q)−q
permutes µq2+q+1, so that also g(X) permutes µq2+q+1, whence F7 per-
(cid:3)
mutes Fq3.

9. The case that n = 3 and k = q2 − q + 1

In this section we prove case (h) of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 9.1. If q is odd then

F8(X) := X − 1
2

Trq3/q

permutes Fq3.

(cid:0)X q2−q+1(cid:1)

PERMUTATION POLYNOMIALS

Proof. Deﬁne

H(X) := 2X (q4+q2)/2 − Trq3/q(X)
L(X) := 2X q − Trq3/q(X)
G(X) := L(H(X)).

First note that L(X) has no nonzero roots in Fq3, since any such root x
would satisfy 2xq = Trq3/q(x) ∈ Fq so that x ∈ Fq, whence L(x) = −x.
Since L(X) is an additive polynomial in Fq3[X], it follows that L(X)
permutes Fq3. Next, for every x ∈ Fq3 we have

Writing S for the set of squares in Fq3, it follows that

G(x2) = L(x)2.

G(S) =(cid:0)L(Fq3)(cid:1)2 = S,

since L permutes Fq3. Let w be any nonsquare in F∗
q, so that also w is
q3 and thus Fq3 = S ∪ wS. Since all terms of both L
a nonsquare in F∗
and H have degree congruent to 1 (mod q − 1), the same is true of G,
so the hypothesis wq−1 = 1 implies that

G(wS) = wG(S) = wS.

Therefore G permutes both S and wS, so G permutes S ∪ wS = Fq3.
Hence also H permutes Fq3, and since gcd(q2 − q + 1, q3 − 1) = 1 it
follows that H(X q2−q+1) permutes Fq3.
It follows that F8(X q) (and
hence F8(X)) permutes Fq3 since H(0) = 0 = F8(0) and for x ∈ F∗
q3 we
have

H(xq2−q+1) = 2xq − Trq3/q(xq2−q+1) = 2F8(xq).

(cid:3)

Our proof of bijectivity of H is inspired by the proof of [5, Thm. 3.7],
which also distinguished the behavior of a function on squares and non-
squares. The key identity L(H(x2)) = L(x)2 in our proof says that
x (cid:55)→ H(x2) is a planar function which is aﬃne equivalent to x (cid:55)→ x2.
Since the nucleus of any semiﬁeld induced by x (cid:55)→ H(x2) is Fq3, the
hypotheses of [5, Thm. 3.7] do not apply in our situation; however, it
appears that those hypotheses can be relaxed to cover both our situa-
tion and several others. Our proof of Theorem 9.1 uses our key identity
to avoid the bulk of the work involved in the proof of [5, Thm. 3.7].

10. The case that k = q(cid:96) + 1 with (cid:96) | n

We now prove case (i) of Theorem 1.1.

16

GOHAR KYUREGHYAN AND MICHAEL E. ZIEVE

Theorem 10.1. For any prime power q and any positive integers (cid:96), n
with 2(cid:96) | n, if γ ∈ Fqn satisﬁes γq2(cid:96)−1 = −1 then the polynomial
F9(x) := X + γ Trqn/q(X q(cid:96)+1) permutes Fqn.

Note that if q is odd then Fqn contains elements γ as in Theorem 10.1

if and only if n is divisible by 4(cid:96).
Proof. By Proposition 2.1, F9 permutes Fqn if and only if for each
α ∈ Fqn the polynomial hα(X) := X + Trqn/q
permutes
Fq. For x ∈ Fq and Q := q(cid:96) we have

(α + γX)q(cid:96)+1(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(α + γx)Q+1 = γQ+1xQ+1 + αγQxQ + αQγx + αQ+1

= γQ+1x2 + αγQx + αQγx + αQ+1,

so that
Trqn/q((α+γx)Q+1) = Trqn/q(γQ+1)x2+Trqn/q(αγQ+αQγ)x+Trqn/q(αQ+1).
Since γQ2−1 = −1, we have γQ+Q2 = −γQ+1 and thus

Trqn/q(γQ+1) = Trqn/Q2(TrQ/q(TrQ2/Q(γQ+1))) = 0.

Likewise,

Trqn/q(αγQ + αQγ) = Trqn/q(αQγQ2 + αQγ) = Trqn/q(0) = 0.

Thus hα induces the same function on Fq as does the polynomial X +
(cid:3)
Trqn/q(αQ+1), so that indeed hα permutes Fq as required.
Remark 10.2. The proof of Theorem 10.1 shows that every α ∈ Fqn
satisﬁes

Trqn/q((α + γx)Q+1) − Trqn/q(αQ+1) = 0,

so that γ is a linear translator of Trqn/q(xQ+1) (as was claimed on page
3). Theorem 10.1 is a generalization of [2, Thm. 6], which addressed
the case of prime q.
