We investigate the band structure of BaBiO3, an insulating parent compound of doped high-
Tc superconductors, using in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on thin ﬁlms. The
data compare favorably overall with density functional theory calculations within the local density
approximation, demonstrating that electron correlations are weak. The bands exhibit Brillouin
zone folding consistent with known BiO6 breathing distortions. At the same time, core level spectra
show no evidence of bismuth charge ordering often thought to accompany the distortions. We
further demonstrate that the bands closest to the Fermi level are primarily oxygen-derived, while
the bismuth 6s states mostly contribute to dispersive bands at deeper binding energy. The results
support a model of Bi-O charge transfer in which hole pairs are localized on combinations of the O
2p orbitals.

A central challenge for understanding unconventional
and/or high-Tc superconductors is elucidating how super-
conductivity emerges from adjacent phases whose inter-
actions might foster [1–4] or inhibit [5, 6] electron pair-
ing. Addressing this issue can be diﬃcult, since often
those phases – Mott insulator, spin/charge density wave,
“strange metal”, and so on – are complex in their own
rights.
In this Letter, we perform angle-resolved pho-
toemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in situ on thin ﬁlms
to reveal the electronic structure of BaBiO3, which is an
insulating parent compound of superconductors with Tc
exceeding 30 K upon doping. Our results indicate that
BaBiO3 is weakly correlated and characterized by a re-
verse (negative) Bi-O charge transfer, thus supporting
a model in which hole pairs are condensed on combi-
nations of the surrounding oxygen 2p orbitals [7]. The
long-sought data are essential information for develop-
ing an understanding of the insulating state, its doping
evolution, and superconductivity in bismuthates.

is not only robust in terms of the high metal-insulator
transition temperature and persistence to high doping,
but also with respect to multiple structural transitions
within the insulating dome, which correspond to various
degrees of breathing and tilting distortions of the BiO6
octahedra. These distortions are depicted in Fig. 1(b)

emerges with higher doping, with optimal Tc near
x = 0.38. At relatively high doping and low temper-
ature, the cubic metallic phases adopts a tetragonal
structure en route to superconductivity.

The origin and electronic nature of BaBiO3’s insulat-
ing phase has been widely discussed. One would naively
expect BaBiO3 to be metallic with a half-ﬁlled 6s band,
but the corresponding Bi4+ oxidation state is not found
in nature. Thus the structure of alternating expanded
and collapsed octahedra has often been interpreted as
evidence of a corresponding charge-ordered state com-
prised of Bi3+ and Bi5+ sites [10]. However, with ex-
ceptions that we will later address [11, 12], experiments
have not observed distinct bismuth valences in BaBiO3
[13–19]. Some theories have modeled the insulating state
in terms of an attractive (negative) eﬀective on-site inter-
action, U [20, 21]. It has also been proposed that holes
reside on the oxygen ligands [15, 19, 22], implying the
inﬂuence of strong Bi-O hybridization or even a negative
charge transfer energy. A recent computational study has
advanced the negative charge transfer view, arguing that
the split bands around EF heavily derive from molecular-
like combinations of O 2p orbitals while the Bi 6s states
mostly contribute to dispersive bands located at deeper
binding energy [7].

Given the questions raised about the role of (negative)
eﬀective on-site interactions in BaBiO3, it is fair to ask
whether single-electron models can accurately describe
the band structure. Indeed, only recently have some cal-
culations succeeded to obtain bandgaps that match rea-
sonably well with experiments [23]. Even then, the agree-
ment between the calculated density of states (DOS) and
momentum-integrated photoemission measurements re-
mains underwhelming. An experimental determination
of the band dispersions can provide better input for the-
orists and help judge the merits of various models.

ARPES is a powerful and direct probe of the elec-
tronic structure solids in k-space. Until now photoemis-
sion studies of BaBiO3 have lacked momentum resolution
[11, 14, 15, 18, 24, 25]. In order to obtain the ARPES
data here, we overcame issues of charging and sample
surface quality by growing smooth, crystalline thin ﬁlms
of BaBiO3 on conducting, grounded bases and perform-
ing the experiments in situ on the freshly prepared sam-
ples. We compare the data with non-relativistic density
functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the local
density approximation (LDA). Additional details regard-
ing the samples, measurements, and calculations can be
found in Supplemental Material [26].

The measured electronic structure is summarized in
Fig. 2. We describe the momentum space in terms of kz

perpendicular to the (001) sample surface and orthogo-
nal kx and ky momenta lying in the surface plane along
the (100) and (010) cubic axes. In ARPES, a given pho-
ton energy, hν, extracts photoelectrons from a sheet of
kz values scanned in the kx-ky plane [27]. From detailed
hν-dependent scans, we veriﬁed that the observed elec-
tronic structure is three-dimensional [26]. As illustrated
in Fig. 2(a), measurements performed with hν = 120 eV
acquire data with kz near the Γ point of the 3D Brillouin
zone, while hν = 105 eV corresponds to a sheet located
close to kz = −π/2a, where a is the simple cubic lattice
constant (≈ 4.3 Å). Figures 2(b)–2(g) show constant en-
ergy maps acquired with hν = 120 eV (left column) and
105 eV (right column) and evaluated at three diﬀerent
binding energies within the highest occupied bands. In
all maps, the counts were integrated within a range of
±15 meV.

The constant energy maps show that the symmetry of
the electronic structure of the thin ﬁlm samples is consis-
tent with the existence of oxygen breathing distortions.
The diﬀerent kz values associated with the two photon
energies lead to distinct appearances of the zone fold-
ing when viewed in the kx-ky plane. Namely, the in-
plane projection of the folded Brillouin zone goes from
being octagonal for hν = 120 eV to square in the case of
hν = 105 eV. These projections are overlaid on their re-
spective maps (dashed lines), along with the simple cubic
Brillouin zone (solid lines).

Analysis of the band dispersions is presented in
Fig. 2(h). Labels c1–c3 refer to cuts through the data
as marked in Fig. 2(b). To clarify the bands, the spec-
tra have been processed using the 2D curvature method
[28]. The k-integrated intensity obtained from cut c2 is
shown in Fig. 2(i). LDA calculations of the bands and
DOS are overlaid on the experimental data in Figs. 2(h)
and 2(i), respectively. For the calculations, we eliminated
the octahedral tilting distortion in accordance with the
structure of BaBiO3 thin ﬁlms grown on various sub-
strates [9]. This slightly increases the bandwidths and
alters some band splittings, modestly but noticeably im-
proving the agreement between the data and LDA. One
should note that the breathing distortions still present in
ﬁlms are found to be the deciding structural factor in
BaBiO3’s insulating behavior [7, 9, 29]. Hence the gen-
eral conclusions of the present study are believed to be
applicable to bulk BaBiO3.

The level of agreement between the data and calcula-
tions demonstrates that LDA methods can successfully
compute most aspects of the band structure of BaBiO3,
including the bandwidths. Consequently, we can infer
that electron correlations are weak. Some portions of
bands are not seen experimentally, which we attribute to
matrix elements and/or coherence factors of the charge
density wave state. Aside from that, the disagreements
are quantitative and relatively minor, though it should
be noted that LDA tends to underestimate the bandgap.

BaBiO3. Following background subtraction (-BG), the data
(circles) are ﬁt by two Gaussians (line). Spectra from Bi2O3
(dashed line; ref. [12]) and NaBiO3 (dotted line; ref. [24]),
representing cases of pure Bi3+ and Bi5+ valence states, re-
spectively, are shown for comparison.

Here the calculated direct gap is 1.45 eV, compared to
an experimental value of ∼ 2 eV in both bulk and thin
ﬁlm samples [30, 31]. Moreover, the calculation ﬁnds the
indirect gap on the verge of closing, whereas our experi-
ments show this is not the case [26]. More costly hybrid
functionals might be able to obtain better quantitative
results regarding the bandgap [23].

Photoemission spectroscopy from core levels is in prin-
ciple well-suited to address the issue of formal Bi charge
ordering in BaBiO3, but previous studies did not arrive at
a consensus. Several measurements found little evidence
of distinct Bi valence states [14, 15, 18, 24]; however, the
outcomes were sensitive to the sample surface prepara-
tions, and in some cases additional peaks or shoulders
were observed [11, 12, 32]. Due to the very short probing
depth of photoemission techniques, it has not been clear
which of these measurements — if any — represent the
intrinsic bulklike electronic structure, rather than some
extrinsic and/or surface-related system that was perhaps
contaminated, damaged, or structurally distorted.

Having demonstrated the 3D insulating band struc-
ture of the BaBiO3 ﬁlms, which matches well with calcu-
lations, the present experiments allow us to deﬁnitively
assess the Bi core level spectra relevant to the bulklike
electronic structure. Figure 3 shows the Bi 4f spectrum
acquired with hν = 220 eV. No evidence of two distinct
Bi charge states is seen; rather, the j = 5/2, 7/2 doublet
is well ﬁt by a double-Gaussian function. The peaks from
BaBiO3 are sharp in comparison to published data from
Bi2O3 [12] and NaBiO3 [24] (nominal representatives of
pure Bi3+ and Bi5+ valence states, respectively), which
argues against mixed or ﬂuctuating valence.

To further uncover the electronic nature of BaBiO3 and
understand why bismuth charge ordering is not observed,
we turn attention to the orbital compositions of the
bands. Figure 4(a) shows the total and orbital-projected

DOS computed from the band structure in Fig. 2(h). The
calculations ﬁnd that the highest occupied bands derive
overwhelmingly from O 2p states, while most of Bi 6s
states contribute to dispersive bands roughly 8 to 13 eV
below EF , accounting for the majority of the DOS in that
energy range. These deep-energy bands, which are nearly
invisible in momentum-integrated photoemission, can be
unambiguously identiﬁed in the ARPES data [compare
Figs. 2(h) and 2(i)]. This allows us to probe the photoe-
mission matrix elements of these bands in order to check
consistency with the calculated orbital hierarchy.

In our experimental geometry [Fig. 4(b)], the photoex-
citation operator, A · p, has even parity (+) with re-
spect to the beam-detector plane when the radiation is
horizontally (H) polarized and odd parity (−) for ver-
tical (V) polarization. Regarding the detected photo-
electron ﬁnal state as a plane wave [27][33], the use
of V polarized photons will cause the matrix element
Mf i ∝ |(cid:104)ψf| A · p|ψi(cid:105)|2 to vanish when the initial state
is even (i.e., Mf i → |(cid:104)+| − |+(cid:105)|2 = 0). By contrast, the

same state would generally be visible when probed in the
H polarization mode. Thus, as a telling signature, a ma-
jority s-orbital character band should exhibit strong tilt-
independent suppression of the photoemission intensity
upon switching from H to V polarization. A band com-
posed of combinations of p-orbitals, on the other hand,
would display more complicated tilt-dependent intensity
diﬀerences between the two polarization modes, since the
orbitals’ parities depend on the geometry.

As shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), constant energy maps
at E − EF = −0.8 eV acquired with H polarization are
similar to those obtained using V polarization, simply
diﬀering in their intensity modulations as a function of
the geometry. In dispersion cuts at kx = 0, which are ob-
tained by tilting the sample, the highest occupied band
is clearly visible over its full bandwidth for both incom-
ing polarizations [Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)]. The peak features
seen in momentum distribution curves (MDCs) evaluated
at E − EF = −0.8 eV and kx = 0, shown in Fig. 4(g),
have similar intensities for both polarizations. The be-

havior is markedly diﬀerent at deeper binding energies
of E − EF (cid:46) −8 eV, where the features seen in the H
mode nearly vanish when probed with V polarization
[Figs. 4(h)–4(l)]. The strong tilt-independent suppres-
sion of spectral weight observed from the bands at deep
binding energy is consistent with a majority s-orbital
character, and serves as further validation of the LDA-
computed DOS.

The determined orbital hierarchy, in which O 2p states
dominate at the gap edge and the Bi 6s states are con-
centrated far below EF , indicates that holes in BaBiO3
reside primarily on the oxygen orbitals. This, in turn,
provides an explanation for the lack of bismuth charge
ordering: hole pairs from the would-be Bi5+ sites of the
collapsed octahedra are transferred to the oxygen ligands,
leaving behind just Bi3+, consistent with core level mea-
surements (Fig. 3). LDA calculations of closely-related
SrBiO3 found that these holes speciﬁcally occupy A1g
combinations of the O 2p orbitals within the sublattice
of collapsed BiO6 octahedra [7]. We note that the result-
ing electronic conﬁguration can be thought of as an s-p
analog of a model proposed for nickelates [34–37].

The overall agreement between the measured and cal-
culated band structure builds conﬁdence in conclusions
drawn from DFT studies. One clear implication is that
strong nesting of the underlying Fermi surface of cubic
BaBiO3 leads to a large static susceptibility peaked at
Q = (π, π, π)/a [7, 38, 39]. The charge density wave
(CDW) state in BaBiO3 is remarkable, however, in terms
of its fully gapped 3D band structure and its temperature
and doping stability. These properties might derive in
part from inﬂuences beyond a pure Peierls model. Specif-
ically, added holes have been proposed to form trapped
(bi)polarons inside the gap [40], which is likewise sup-
ported by application of DFT [41].

These and other studies [42] certainly point toward
strong electron-phonon interactions in BaBiO3, although
it is still not clear whether the high optimal Tc in,
e.g., Ba1−xKxBiO3 can be entirely explained within
BCS strong coupling theory [43, 44]. For example, as
(bi)polarons become mobile with increased hole doping,
superconductivity in the bismuthates could involve local
bosonic pairs [45, 46]. In many cases, bipolaronic super-
conductivity has been discussed in the context of a classi-
cally charge-ordered state in BaBiO3, regarding electron
and hole pairs as localized on the supposed Bi3+ and
Bi5+ sites. Our data demonstrate that in the undoped
ground state all Bi atoms have essentially ﬁlled 6s shells,
and the Bi sites of the collapsed and expanded octahe-
dral sublattices diﬀer in terms of their screening by holes
distributed on the surrounding oxygen orbitals. Theo-
ries of superconductivity in bismuthates (bipolaronic or
otherwise) may beneﬁt from taking this more accurate
description of the electronic conﬁguration and screening
into account.

In conclusion, by performing in situ spectroscopy

5

on freshly grown ﬁlms, we have obtained the ﬁrst
ARPES measurements from the high-Tc parent com-
pound BaBiO3. The data are in good agreement with
DFT-LDA calculations. The simultaneous observations
of the folded Brillouin zone due to oxygen breathing
distortions and sharp, single-component Bi core levels
demonstrate that the structurally inequivalent Bi sites
have virtually identical valences. In the calculations, the
bands closest to EF are primarily derived from O 2p
states, while the Bi 6s states mostly contribute to the
deep-energy band structure, which is shown to be consis-
tent with the behavior of the ARPES matrix elements.
The results signal the inﬂuence of a negative charge trans-
fer energy, driving hole pairs to occupy ligand states on
the collapsed octahedra. The ﬁndings should be rele-
vant for understanding the doping evolution and super-
conducting behavior of doped bismuthate compounds.
