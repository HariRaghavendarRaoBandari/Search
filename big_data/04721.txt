Abstract

Subjective tinnitus (ST) is generally assumed to be a consequence of hearing loss (HL).
In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of ST, in human studies ST
patients without increased hearing thresholds were found to suﬀer from so called hidden
HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with pathologically increased spontaneous ﬁring rates
and neuronal hyperactivity (NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity
(HP) has been proposed as a compensation mechanism leading to the development of
NH, arguing that after HL initially decreased mean ﬁring rates of neurons are subse-
quently restored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally
lack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean ﬁring rate constant remains
elusive as does the beneﬁt this might have in terms of information processing. Further-
more the neural circuitry being able to perform the comparison of preferred with actual
mean ﬁring rate remains unclear. Here we propose an entirely new interpretation of ST
related development of NH in terms of information theory. We suggest that stochastic
resonance (SR) plays a key role in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory
system and is the ultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neu-
roscience and refers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be
transmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves to lift
signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently decreasing thresholds
again. The increased amount of internal noise is the correlate of the NH, which ﬁnally
leads to the development of ST, due to neuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway.
We demonstrate the plausibility of our hypothesis by using a computational model and
provide exemplarily ﬁndings of human and animal studies that are consistent with our
model.

Introduction

It is estimated that around 10 to 15 percent of the
general population suﬀer from subjective tinnitus.
This phantom percept can be very severe for af-
fected patients and lead to insomnia, psychological
disorders or even suicide (Coles, 1984; Lewis et al.,
1994; Langguth et al., 2011). Tinnitus is often ac-
companied by a hearing loss (Heller, 2003) and re-
cent animal studies indicate that even a relatively
mild acoustic trauma may lead to a massive loss of
synapses (synaptopathy) causing a so called hidden
hearing loss (Liberman et al., 2015). However, an
eﬀective cure for tinnitus still does not exist, since
the exact mechanisms within the auditory pathway
leading to the development of tinnitus are still de-
bated (Gerken, 1996; Eggermont, 2003; Eggermont
and Roberts, 2004; Engineer et al., 2011; Knipper
et al., 2011; Schaette and McAlpine, 2011; Ruttiger
et al., 2013).

Some models propose a mechanism within the
central auditory system called homeostatic plas-
ticity (HP): Prolonged changes in the mean ﬁring
rates of the auditory nerve are assumed to cause
HP, thereby restoring these mean ﬁring rates and
thus compensating for reduced cochlear input. This
gain increase leads to increased spontaneous rates
which are hypothesized to be the correlate of hy-
peractivity (Schaette and Kempter, 2006; Knipper
et al., 2011; Schaette and McAlpine, 2011). How-
ever all HP models fundamentally lack explanatory
power since it remains totally elusive why the mean
ﬁring rate of neurons should be kept constant and
which beneﬁt this might have in terms of informa-
tion processing. Furthermore a concrete neural cir-
cuitry being able to perform the comparison of the
preferred with the actual mean ﬁring rate remains
unclear.

Here we propose an entirely new information the-
ory inspired interpretation of tinnitus-related de-
velopment of neuronal hyperactivity. Stochastic
resonance (SR) refers to the phenomenon that sub-
threshold unperceivable signals can be transmitted
by adding noise to the sensor input (Benzi et al.,
1981; Collins et al., 1996; Levin et al., 1996; Gam-
maitoni et al., 1998). SR has been found ubiqui-
tous in nature covering a wide range of systems
in physical, technological and biological contexts
(Wiesenfeld and Moss, 1995) and especially within
the context of neuroscience (Faisal et al., 2008;

Mino et al., 2014; Douglass et al., 1993).
In ad-
dition, the existence of an optimal, non-zero inten-
sity for the added noise has been demonstrated,
allowing maximization of information transmission
(Wiesenfeld and Moss, 1995). In self-adaptive sig-
nal detection systems based on SR, the optimum
noise level is continuously adjusted via a feed-back
loop, so that the system response in terms of in-
formation throughput remains optimal, even if the
properties of the input signal change. For this pro-
cessing principle the term adaptive SR has been
coined (Mitaim et al., 1998; Mitaim et al., 2004;
Wenning et al., 2003). An objective function to
quantify information content is the mutual infor-
mation (MI) between the sensor input and output
(Shannon, 1948). In the context of SR the MI is
frequently used in theoretical approaches (Levin et
al., 1996; Moss et al., 2004; Mitaim et al., 2004).
The choice of the MI is natural since the funda-
mental purpose of any transducer is to transmit in-
formation into a subsequent information processing
system. It has been shown previously that the MI
as a function of noise intensity has a well-deﬁned
peak that indicates the ideal level of noise to be
added to the input signal (Moss et al., 2004). How-
ever, a fundamental drawback of the MI is the im-
possibility of calculating it in any application of
adaptive SR where the signal to be detected is un-
known (Krauss et al., 2015). Furthermore, even
if the underlying signal is known, the use of the
MI still seems to be rather impractical within the
context of neural network architectures, since cal-
culating the MI requires evaluating probability dis-
tributions, logarithms, products and fractions. In a
previous work we were able to show that this funda-
mental drawback can be overcome by another ob-
jective function, namely the autocorrelation (AC)
of the detector response. Maximizing the output
AC leads to similar or even identical estimates of
optimal noise intensities for SR as the MI, yet with
the decisive advantage that no knowledge of the
input signal is required (Krauss et al., 2015).
In
addition, the evaluation of AC functions may be
quite easily implemented within neural networks
using delay-lines and coincidence detectors (Lick-
lider, 1951). Remarkably, a neural architecture,
resembling the aforementioned delay-lines is found
in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) (Osen, 1988;
Hackney et al., 1990). In addition, the DCN is the
earliest processing stage in the auditory pathway

2

where tinnitus-related changes have been observed.
Acoustic trauma leads to increased spontaneous ﬁr-
ing rates in the DCN (Kaltenbach et al., 1998,
2000; Kaltenbach and Afrman, 2000; Brozoski et
al., 2002; Kaltenbach et al., 2004), whereby the
amount of this increase is correlated to the strength
of the behavioral signs for tinnitus (Kaltenbach et
al., 2004) and this hyperactivity is only found in
regions innervated by the damaged parts of the
cochlear receptor epithelium (Kaltenbach et al.,
2002).

Summing up, we propose that adaptive SR based
on maximizing the AC of the cochlear output is a
major processing principle in the auditory system
and operates both on short and long time scales
to maintain maximum information detection even
though the statistics of the input (sound intensi-
ties) are changing. If, due to acoustic trauma, the
cochlear output is reduced then the AC calculated
within the DCN decreases. Hence the internal noise
generated within the DCN increases to improve in-
formation throughput again. In the case of chronic
cochlear damages the internal noise is increased
permanently, which is the correlate of hyperactivity
often associated with subjective tinnitus.

Methods

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Uhlenbeck and Orn-
stein, 1930) in order to generate a correlated time
series of intensity levels, yet with identical mean
value and standard deviation (ﬁgure 1).

Figure 1: Sound intensities. Two sample time series
of sound intensities are shown (A). The uncorrelated
time series (orange) has been generated by drawing val-
ues from a Gaussian distribution, whereas the corre-
lated time series (blue) is derived from an Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck process. Although both time series look very
diﬀerent their probability density functions (B) and cu-
mulative distributions (C) are identical.

We implemented a phenomenological model of the
acoustic stimuli, the auditory nerve responses and
the eﬀects of cochlear damage to auditory nerve re-
sponses. Furthermore, we model the adaptive SR
principle based on mean AC in terms of coarse-
grained functional units within the DCN. We fo-
cus on input-output mappings and not on single
neuron models or concrete neural network archi-
tectures. Nevertheless we emphasize that each part
of the adaptive SR feedback-loop is highly biologi-
cally plausible and may be implemented in a more
ﬁne-grained model.

Distribution of sound intensities According
to (Schaette et al., 2006) we assume the probabil-
ity density function of the sound intensity levels I
(in dB) to be Gaussian with a mean value of 40
dB and standard deviation of 25 dB. In contrast
to the aforementioned study, as input to the model
we do not draw independent samples from this dis-
tribution during simulation but instead used an

Auditory nerve responses The ﬁring rate f (I)
of the auditory nerve at a sound intensity I is mod-
elled analogous to (Schaette et al., 2006) with a
threshold Ith of 0 dB, spontaneous ﬁring rate fsp
of 50 Hz and maximum ﬁring rate fmax of 250
Hz. The response function f (I) is assumed to be
adapted to the distribution of sound intensities.
For I > Ith, f (I) is proportional to the normal-
ized cumulative distribution function of the sound
intensities hence, according to the infomax princi-
ple, f (I) has maximum information on I (Laughlin,
1981). In scope of this preprint article we focus on
changes to the threshold Ith due to cochlear damage
only and do not take into account changes of the
spontaneous ﬁring rate fsp or the maximum ﬁring
rate fmax. In ﬁgure 2 some example rate-intensity
functions are shown for diﬀerent thresholds.

sists of two functional units that build up a feedback-
loop. The information detector (ID) calculates the AC,
reﬂecting the information content, of the time course
of auditory nerve ﬁring rates coming from the cochlea.
The noise generator (NG) is controlled by the ID and
injects noise to the cochlea via feedback connections.
We propose that both, the ID and the NG are located
within the dorsal cochlear nucleus.

Results

The aim of this study was to demonstrate how
adaptive SR based on maximizing the AC may
lead to permanently increased internal noise af-
ter chronic cochlear damages. Therefore we ﬁrst
present the eﬀect of increased thresholds to the AC
function of the time series of auditory nerve ﬁring
rates f (t) and subsequently the beneﬁt of SR to the
AC.

Damage to the cochlea decreases the mean
AC We evaluate the AC function of the time se-
ries of auditory nerve ﬁring rates f (t) as deﬁned in
the method section.
In ﬁgure 4A autocorrelation
functions for diﬀerent thresholds are shown. For
increased thresholds the values of the AC function
systematically shift to smaller values, reﬂecting the
decreased amount of information content perceived
by the cochlea. The mean AC obtained by aver-
aging the AC function over all evaluated lag-times
decreases monotonically with increasing threshold
(ﬁgure 4B).

SR improves mean AC and increases inter-
nal noise after hearing loss The beneﬁcial ef-
fect of SR, as well as the increase of internal noise
are shown in ﬁgure 5. In ﬁgure 5A a sample AC
function for a threshold Ith of 30 dB is shown with
(green) and without (red) the eﬀect of SR. As can
be clearly seen, SR is able to signiﬁcantly improve
the AC. The beneﬁcial eﬀect of SR for diﬀerent

rates f (t) as a function of the time lag τ which
is deﬁned as

Cf f (τ ) = (cid:104)(f (t) f (t+τ )(cid:105)t

where (cid:104)·(cid:105)t indicates averaging over time. In order
to derive a single value from this function, the mean
of the autocorrelation function

Cf f = (cid:104)Cf f (τ )(cid:105)τ

(2)
is calculated, where (cid:104)·(cid:105)τ indicates averaging over all
lag-times.

Adaptive stochastic resonance model Our
adaptive SR model mainly consists of two func-
tional units that build up a feedback-loop. The
ﬁrst unit receives input from the cochlea and cal-
culates the AC, reﬂecting the information content,
of the time course of auditory nerve ﬁring rates.
We refer to this unit as the information detector
(ID). The second unit is controlled by the ID and
injects noise to the sensory epithelium within the
cochlea via eﬀerent connections. For this part of
the system we use the term noise generator (NG)
(ﬁgure 3).

Implementation The model was implemented
on a standard desktop PC using the programming
language C/C++.

aging the AC function over all evaluated lag-times de-
creases monotonically with increasing threshold (B).

is summarized in (B). With increasing thresholds more
noise is required to improve the AC (ﬁgure 5C).

thresholds is summarized in ﬁgure 5B. With in-
creasing thresholds more noise is required to im-
prove the AC (ﬁgure 5C). This permanently in-
creased noise is according to our hypothesis the
correlate of tinnitus-related neuronal hyperactivity.

Discussion

We demonstrated how adaptive SR based on
maximizing the AC of the cochlear output may
cause neuronal hyperactivity in the case of chronic
cochlear damages. This hyperactivty, if permanent,
is thought to induce neuroplastic changes along the
auditory pathway that subsequently lead to the de-
velopment of subjective, central tinnitus. Further-

more, we suppose the DCN to be the site where SR
is controlled. This is plausible since the neuronal
architecture, i.e. delay lines and coincidence de-
tecting neurons, required to calculate the AC are
actually found within the DCN. Furthermore the
DCN receives massive non-auditory input from so-
matosensory nuclei which may serve as some kind
of internal noise, which is also required for SR.

From human studies it is known that the presen-
tation of external noise simultaneous to pure tones
is actually able to signiﬁcantly improve the hearing
thresholds for the pure tones via SR (Zeng et al.,
2000; Ries, 2007).

Another aspect that supports our hypothesis is
the so called Zwicker tone illusion. The term de-

The typ-
ical sound generating it is a broadband noise con-
taining a spectral gap, which is presented for sev-
eral seconds. After the noise has been switched
oﬀ, a faint, almost pure, tone is audible for 1 up
to 6 seconds. It is decaying and has a sharp pitch
in the spectral gap where no stimulus was avail-
able (Zwicker, 1964; Lummis and Guttman, 1972).
Both the localization of the Zwicker tone in the
brain and its origin have been long-standing open
problems. In terms of our model we would expect
the cause of this auditory illusion to be the SR con-
trolled upregulated internal noise. Even though,
thresholds are not increased within the channel
usually processing frequencies that are within the
spectral gap of the presented noise, it is plausible
that cross-talk between adjacent frequency chan-
nels plays a role here. The sound intensities, or
auditory nerve ﬁring rates respectively, of neigh-
bouring channels may serve as some kind of refer-
ence. Another ﬁnding which is perfectly consistent
with our model is the fact that during the Zwicker
tone sensation, auditory sensitivity for tone pulses
at frequencies adjacent to the Zwicker tone are im-
proved by up to 13 dB (Wiegrebe et al., 1996).
