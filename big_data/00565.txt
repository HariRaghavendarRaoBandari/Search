AN OPEN DAY IN THE METRIC SPACE

SVEN-AKE WEGNER1 AND KATRIN ROLKA 2

Abstract. We report on a workshop for year eleven high school students which took place in the
framework of a university open day. During the workshop the participants ﬁrst deduced the major
properties of the intuitive concept of distance from real life examples. After this preparation, the
formal deﬁnition of a metric space was introduced and discussed by means of problem-oriented
exercise sessions performed in small groups.

1. Introduction

During the last decade, the amount of events organized at the universities but intended for students
of high school or even elementary school increased signiﬁcantly. The aim of many of these events is to
recruit future university students in the respective discipline. In view of the high number of university
dropouts—in particular in mathematics—it is worthwhile to design recruiting events not for the single
aim to maximize the number of future students but also in a way which allows the participants to
get a realistic insight into their future life as a student. In order to achieve this goal we suggest to
use a format which allows to immitate the main actions which university students have to perform
during their mathematics studies, in particular those of the ﬁrst year at university: attending lectures,
solving exercises alone or in small groups and presenting solutions to their classmates. In addition we
suggest that the level of the lectures and exercises at least punctually should reach university level.
In order to meet the latter goals, ﬁrst an appropriate topic has to be selected. On the one hand it
needs to be accessible for high school students and on the other hand it should allow to illustrate what
university studies are about. Secondly, a workshop concept which inherits the above three actions
(attend lectures, solve exercises, present solutions) has to be designed.
In this article we report on a workshop for year eleven high school students which we organized in the
summer term 2013 at the University of Wuppertal and whose topic was the mathematical notion of
a metric space. In Section 2 we precise the material covered and we explain our work ﬂow during the
workshop. In Section 3 we present and discuss the feedback which we received by the participants.

2. Workshop

Our workshop entitled “Metric Spaces—on the notion of distance in mathematics” took place in the
summer term 2013 at the University of Wuppertal. It was part of the Wuppertal Summer University,
a one week open day for female students from high school interested in mathematics, natural sciences
or engineering. Our aim was in particular to complement other formats like lectures, presentations
or panel discussions by an event which assigns to the participants an active role and allows them to
experience what it means to study mathematics. The workshop took place in a seminar room and
lasted for two hours. Eleven high school students, between 16 and 18 years old, participated.
In
order to allow the students to work on the exercises together, we split them into four groups. Since
we recruited four undergraduate students to help during the workshop we were able to assign one
teaching assistant to each group to support during the exercise sessions.
In order to make our workshop on the basis of this article easily reproducable we give in the sequel
an outline of the lecture, the exercises and their solutions. We note that the following is a selection of

standard material as presented in courses on analysis and can be found together with more background
information in many textbooks. We refer, e.g., to Rudin [4, Chapter 2, p.30ﬀ], Browder [2, Chapter
6.2], Amann, Escher [1, Chapter II.1] and Dugundji [3, Chapter IX].

We started the workshop with the following exercise for the students.

1. Exercise. Find a meaningful notion of distance in the following four situations.

(1) Points in the plane.
(2) Places in the city.

(3) Members of a social network.

(4) Continuous functions f , g : [0, 1] → R, e.g., f (x) = √x, g(x) = x3.

After a run of about ﬁfteen minutes we presented a possible solution and discussed the results found
by the students during the prior working period.

(1) Points P0 and P1 in the plane can be described by coordinates P0 = (x0, y0), P1 = (x1, y1).
The “usual distance”, i.e., the length of a straight line from P0 to P1, can then be expressed
via the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the coordinates, that is

compare Fig. 1 (left).

d(P0, P1) =p(y1 − y0)2 + (x1 − x0)2,

(2) As an example consider the city map of Manhattan and deﬁne as the distance of two places

the kilometers you have to drive when you take the shortest route, cf. Fig. 1 (right).

(3) A distance of two members can be deﬁned as the minimal number of “hops” which is needed
to pass from member A to member B when it is only allowed to jump between members which
are friends. In the network pictured in Fig. 2 (left) we have for instance d(A, F ) = 4.

(4) The distance of f and g can, e.g., be deﬁned as the maximum of the modulus of their diﬀerence

over their domain, i.e.,

d(f, g) = max

06x61|f (x) − g(x)|.

In the example given, f (x) = √x, g(x) = x3, d(f, g) = 5/(6 5√6) can be explicity computed by
methods usually taught at school, cf. Fig. 2 (right).

After presenting the above we turned to the next task for which we prepared an exercise sheet.

2. Exercise. Review the examples from Exercise 1 by working on the following tasks.

(a) Decide whether the distance function d = d(x, y) of the examples (1)–(4) satisﬁes the following

properties, respectively.
1. Distances are always real numbers, i.e., d(x, y) ∈ R.
2. Distances are always positive, i.e., d(x, y) > 0.

3. The distance of a point to itself is zero, i.e., d(x, x) = 0.
4. If the distance of two points is zero, then the points are equal, i.e., d(x, y) = 0 ⇒ x = y.
5. The distance is independent of the order of the points, i.e., d(x, y) = d(y, x).
6. A detour can only increase the distance, more precisely, d(x, y) 6 d(x, z) + d(z, y).

(b) Find a city map such that the symmetry condition 5. fails in the situation of Exercise 1(2).

(c) We consider the network

and deﬁne d(xi, xj) as in Exercise 1(3) if 1 6 i, j 6 2. Deﬁne the remaining distances such
that condition 6. in (a) is not satisﬁed but all other conditions are valid.

After a short period for the participants to work on the tasks we asked three of them to present their
solutions. In the case of (a) this was done orally, for (b) and (c) the participants used a ﬂip chart
to draw the corresponding picture (a city map with a oneway road) and to write down the deﬁnition
(e.g., d(x1, x3) = d(x3, x1) = 3 and d(x2, x3) = d(x3, x2) = 1), respectively.

Part (a) above was already a preparation of the formal deﬁnition of the metric as we added mathe-
matical expressions to the properties’ formulation in prose.

3. Deﬁnition. Let M be a set. A function d : M × M → R, (x, y) 7→ d(x, y) is said to be a metric if
the following conditions hold for all x, y and z in M .
(M1) d(x, y) > 0 and d(x, y) = 0 ⇔ x = y,
(M2) d(x, y) = d(y, x),

(positive deﬁniteness)

(symmetry)

(M3) d(x, y) 6 d(x, z) + d(z, y).

(triangle inequality)

In order to illustrate how to check the conditions in a concrete situation we considered ﬁrst the absolute
value metric and proved in detail that it is indeed a metric.

4. Theorem. The function d : R × R → R, d(x, y) = |x − y| deﬁnes a metric on R.
Proof. We have to check that the conditions (M1)–(M3) hold. Let x, y and z be real numbers.

The estimate d(x, y) > 0 is valid by deﬁnition. Moreover, d(x, x) = |x − x| = 0 holds and d(x, y) = 0
implies |x − y| = 0 and thus x = y. This proves (M1).
For (M2) it is enough to compute

Finally, we have

d(x, y) = |x − y| = |y − x| = d(y, x).

d(x, y) = |x − y| = |x − z + z − y|

6 |x − z| + |z − y| = d(x, z) + d(z, y).

Here, we used |a + b| 6 |a| + |b| with a = x − z and b = z − y. The latter is equivalent to (a + b)2 6
(|a| + |b|)2 which in turn is equivalent to a2 + 2ab + b2 6 a2 + 2|a||b| + b2 which is obvious after
cancellation. This completes the proof of (M3).

The next step was the task for the participants to check the properties (M1)–(M3) in another example
by themselves. Note, that the following so-called Manhattan metric corresponds to the right picture
in Fig. 1.
5. Exercise. Prove that d : R2 × R2 → R, d(x, y) = |x1 − y1| + |x2 − y2| is a metric.
We leave the solution to the reader and point out that we explained the major techniques in Theorem
4. The participants thus can re-use the proof given above. In order to show that the concept of a
metric space is not just abstract nonsense we gave the following application.

6. Application. Metric spaces are the setting in which convergence of sequences can be deﬁned:
Let (xn)n∈N be a sequence and x a point in M . We say that (xn)n∈N converges to x, and write
limn→∞ xn = x, if for every number ε > 0 there exists an integer n0 such that for all integers n > n0
the estimate d(xn, x) < ε holds.

The participants learned at school about convergence of sequences and were used to the notation
limn→∞ xn. However, at school this is usually not explained in a rigorous way. We used the above in
order to point out on the one hand that the notion of metric spaces now allows for a formal deﬁnition
which is a clear advantage compared with an only intuitive idea of convergence. On the other hand it
shows that convergence is not an intrinsic feature of the real numbers, but depends on the selection
of a metric.

7. Example. We consider the following two examples of diﬀerent metrics on the real line.

(1) Let M = R, d be the absolute value metric, xn = 1

n and x = 0. Let ε > 0 be arbitrary.
< ε.

We select n0 > 1
Therefore, we proved limn→∞

(2) Let M = R and q be the so-called trivial metric, i.e.,

otherwise.

For (xn)n∈N and x as in (1) we then have q(xn, x) = q( 1

n , 0) = 1 for any integer n. Thus,
n = 0 is not true with respect to the metric q. Convergence thus depends on the

Finally, we turn back to the last example from Exercise 1 in order to complement what we did so far
by an example which really extends the scope of school mathematics.

8. Example. Let M = C[0, 1] be the set of all continuous functions from [0, 1] to R. The metric
d(f, g) = max06x61 |f (x)−g(x)| allows to study if a sequence of functions is convergent. The sequence
fn(x) = sin( x
n ) for instance converges to the zero function but for the sequence gn(x) = xn there is
no continuous function g such that limn→∞ gn = g holds with respect to the metric d.

fn(x) = sin( x

n )

gn(x) = xn

Figure 3. A convergent sequence of functions (left) and a non-convergent sequence (right).

For the last example we did not give a proof, but indicated pictures of the fn and gn, see Fig. 3, such
that the participants at least got a feeling for the statement.

In Section 1, we formulated as goal of our workshop to paint a realistic picture of mathematical
studies at university. Our workshop met this goal in two ways: The ﬁrst way is concerned with a

3. Reflection

more theoretically based analysis of the content of the workshop. It inherited lecture parts which
not only touched university level but also provided a realistic insight in basic skills and methods
used in mathematics: Deﬁnition 3, Theorem 4 and the notion of convergence given in Application 6
appear verbatim in many ﬁrst year courses on analysis. The participants solved exercises, in particular
Exercise 5 is compatible with homework for ﬁrst year university students. Finally, the participants
presented the solutions to their classmates as it is usually required during the exercise sessions for
university students. Due to the concept of working in small groups with one teaching assistant assigned
to each group it was possible to give the participants not only a feeling what mathematical studies
are but also what mathematics is about.

The second way in which the workshop met our goal stated in Section 1 is related to students’ written
feedback. After the workshop, they were asked to answer the following prompts:

(1) What did you like? What did you understand well?

(2) What didn’t you like? What didn’t you understand well?
(3) What additional comments do you have?

Two students mentioned that they liked that the workshop was close to university studies:

“probably very similar to university studies”

“good insight into university studies”

Five students explicitly mentioned that they liked the active participation via exercises, e.g.:

“by computing ourselves we could understand everything much better”

“concrete exercises and not only theory”

Eight students appreciated working in small groups and explicitly mentioned it, e.g.:

“working independently in groups”

With regards to criticism, two participants indicated that the topic was diﬃcult, eight mentioned that
the lecture parts were too fast and that there was not enough time for the exercises whereby one
student, at the same time, admitted in a rather rational way “due to university studies”. However,
the latter impressions are a characteristic aspect of studies in mathematics and that it is therefore a
good idea to inform prospective students honestly about this issue before they ﬁnally decide which
major they want to take.

As we explained in Section 3 the workshop was very successful. It met our goal and it received a great
feedback from the participants. We can thus recommend the workshop format as well as our concrete
topic to anybody interested in organizing an open day in mathematics.
