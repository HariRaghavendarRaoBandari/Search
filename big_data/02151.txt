Measurements of W±Z production cross sections in pp collisions at

s = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector and limits on anomalous

The ATLAS Collaboration

Abstract

This paper presents measurements of W±Z production in pp collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of 8 TeV. The gauge bosons are reconstructed using their leptonic decay modes into
electrons and muons. The data were collected in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the
Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb−1. The mea-
= 35.1 ± 0.9
sured inclusive cross section in the detector ﬁducial region is σW±Z→(cid:96)
(stat.) ± 0.8 (sys.) ± 0.8 (lumi.) fb, for one leptonic decay channel. In comparison, the next-
to-leading-order Standard Model expectation is 30.0 ± 2.1 fb. Cross sections for W +Z and
W−Z production and their ratio are presented as well as diﬀerential cross sections for several
kinematic observables. Limits on anomalous triple gauge boson couplings are derived from
the transverse mass spectrum of the W±Z system. From the analysis of events with a W and
a Z boson associated with two or more forward jets an upper limit at 95% conﬁdence level
on the W±Z scattering cross section of 0.63 fb, for each leptonic decay channel, is estab-
lished, while the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading order is 0.13 fb. Limits on
anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings are also extracted.

The study of W±Z diboson production is an important test of the Standard Model (SM) for its sensitivity
to the gauge boson self-interactions, related to the non-Abelian structure of the electroweak interaction.
It provides the means to investigate vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, which directly probe the
electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the SM, and to extract constraints on anomalous triple and
quartic gauge boson couplings (aTGC and aQGC). Improved constraints can probe scales of new physics
in the multi-TeV range and provide a way to look for signals of new physics in a model-independent way.

Precise measurements of W±Z production will also help to improve the existing QCD calculations of this
process.
This paper presents measurements of the W±Z production cross section and limits on the aTGC and
aQGC obtained by analyzing proton–proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV.
The leptonic decay modes of the W and Z bosons are used and all quoted ﬁducial production cross
sections include the branching ratio of the gauge bosons into channels with electrons or muons. The
analyzed data sample was collected in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb−1. Experimentally, W±Z production has
the advantage of a higher cross section than ZZ production. At the same time, with three charged leptons
and the requirement that two of them originate from a Z boson, the leptonic W±Z ﬁnal states are easier to
discriminate from the background than the leptonic WW ﬁnal states.
Measurements of the W±Z production cross section have been reported in proton–antiproton collisions
s = 1.96 TeV by the CDF and D0 collaborations [1, 2] using integrated
at a center-of-mass energy of
luminosities of 7.1 fb−1 and 8.6 fb−1, respectively, and for
s = 7 TeV proton–proton collisions, using an
integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb−1, by the ATLAS Collaboration [3]. Limits on anomalous charged-current
gauge couplings were also reported previously by the LEP, Tevatron, and LHC experiments [4–6]. In
hadron collisions, the selection of W±Z ﬁnal states allows direct access to the WWZ gauge coupling
without the need of disentangling it from the WWγ gauge coupling as in W±W∓ events from hadronic or
e+e− collisions.
Compared to the previously published measurements, this paper uses data collected at a higher center-
of-mass energy with a four-fold increase in integrated luminosity and presents additional measurements.
The production cross section is measured in a ﬁducial phase space inclusively and as single diﬀerential
cross sections as a function of each of several kinematic variables: the transverse momentum pT of the W
and Z bosons, the jet multiplicity, the transverse mass of the WZ system, mWZ
T , and the pT of the neutrino
associated with the W boson decay. An interesting feature of this last distribution is its sensitivity to
the polarization of the W boson, similarly to the pT of the lepton of the W boson decay. Finally, the
distribution of the absolute diﬀerence between the rapidities of the Z boson and the lepton from the W
boson decay is measured, which was proposed as an alternative variable to look for aTGC and was also
found to be sensitive to the approximately zero helicity amplitude that is predicted at leading order (LO)
in the SM [7, 8]. Limits on aTGC are extracted from the mWZ
distribution, which is found to be less
T
sensitive to higher-order perturbative eﬀects in QCD [9] and electroweak (EW) theory [10, 11] than other
observables, e.g., pZ
T.
The ratio of W +Z/W−Z integrated production cross sections, sensitive to the choice of parton distribution
functions (PDF), is measured along with the evolution of this ratio as a function of the kinematic variables
introduced above. Charge-dependent distributions may be helpful in investigating CP violation eﬀects in
the interaction between gauge bosons. This paper also includes a study of W±Z vector boson scattering,
characterized by the presence of at least two forward jets, which is sensitive to quartic gauge couplings.
Events with a W±Z j j ﬁnal state are used to set limits on the VBS cross section and on aQGC in the
WZWZ vertex.

The results are compared with the SM cross-section predictions, which at present are fully calculated only
up to the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD [12, 13].

The paper is organized as follows. The ATLAS detector is described in Section 2. The deﬁnition of
the ﬁducial phase space used in this paper is presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the available
theoretical predictions. Section 5 provides details of the simulated samples used for the measurements.

A description of the data set and the selection criteria are given in Section 6. Section 7 presents the back-
ground estimation and Section 8 provides comparisons of observed and expected events and of kinematic
distributions at reconstructed level. The procedure used to correct for detector eﬀects and for acceptance
is described in Section 9. The treatment of the systematic uncertainties is detailed in Section 10. Sec-
tions 11, 12, and 13 describe the combination procedure of the four leptonic W±Z decay channels and
discuss the results. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Section 14.

2 The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [14] is a multipurpose detector with a cylindrical geometry and nearly 4π coverage in
solid angle. The collision point is surrounded by inner tracking devices, which are followed in increasing
distance from the center by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic ﬁeld, a calorimeter
system, and a muon spectrometer.

The inner tracker provides precise position and momentum measurements of charged particles in the
pseudorapidity1 range |η| < 2.5. It consists of three subdetectors arranged in a coaxial geometry around
the silicon pixel detector, the silicon microstrip detector, and the transition radiation
the beam axis:
tracker.
Electromagnetic calorimetry in the region |η| < 3.2 is based on a high-granularity, lead/liquid-argon (LAr)
sampling technology. Hadronic calorimetry uses a steel/scintillating-tile detector covering the region
|η| < 1.7 and a copper/LAr detector in the region 1.5 < |η| < 3.2. The most forward region of the detector
3.1 < |η| < 4.9 is equipped with a dedicated forward calorimeter, measuring electromagnetic and hadronic
energies using copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr modules.

The muon spectrometer comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers to measure the
deﬂection of muons in a magnetic ﬁeld generated by three large superconducting toroids arranged with an
eightfold azimuthal coil symmetry around the calorimeters. The high-precision chambers cover a range
of |η| < 2.7. The muon trigger system covers the range |η| < 2.4 with resistive plate chambers in the
barrel, and thin gap chambers in the endcap regions.

A three-level trigger system is used to select events in real time. A hardware-based Level-1 trigger uses
a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to a value of at most 75 kHz. The rate of
accepted events is then reduced to about 400 Hz by two software-based trigger levels, Level-2 and the
Event Filter.

3 Phase-space deﬁnition

The phase-space deﬁnition used in this paper relies on ﬁnal-state prompt leptons2 [15] associated with
the W and Z boson decay, as explained in detail below.

1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector
and the z-axis along the beam direction. The x-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points
upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, φ) are used in the transverse (x, y) plane, φ being the azimuthal angle around the beam
direction. The pseudorapidity is deﬁned in terms of the polar angle θ as η = −ln [tan(θ/2)].
2 A prompt lepton is a lepton that is not produced in the decay of a hadron or a τ or their descendants.

At particle level, the kinematics of ﬁnal-state prompt electrons and muons is computed including the con-

These dressed leptons and the ﬁnal-state neutrinos that do not originate from hadron or τ decays are
associated with the W and Z boson decay products with an algorithmic approach, called “resonant shape”.
This algorithm is based on the value of an estimator expressing the product of the nominal line shapes of
the W and Z resonances

respectively, as reported by the Particle Data Group [16]. The input to the estimator is the invariant mass
m of all possible pairs ((cid:96)+, (cid:96)−) and ((cid:96)(cid:48), ν(cid:96)(cid:48)) satisfying the ﬁducial selection requirements deﬁned in the
next paragraph. The ﬁnal choice of which leptons are assigned to the W or Z bosons corresponds to the
conﬁguration exhibiting the highest value of the estimator. Using this speciﬁc association algorithm, the
gauge boson kinematics can be computed using the kinematics of the associated leptons independently of
any internal Monte Carlo generator details.

The integrated and diﬀerential cross-section measurements are performed in a ﬁducial phase space deﬁned
at particle level by the following requirements: the pT of the leptons from the Z boson decay is greater
than 15 GeV, the pT of the charged lepton from the W decay is greater than 20 GeV, the absolute value of
the pseudorapidity of the charged leptons from the W and Z bosons are less than 2.5, the invariant mass
of the two leptons from the Z boson decay diﬀers at most by 10 GeV from the world average value of the
T · [1 − cos ∆φ((cid:96), ν)], where
Z boson mass mPDG
∆φ((cid:96), ν) is the angle between the lepton and the neutrino in the transverse plane, is required to be greater
than 30 GeV. In addition, it is required that the angular distance ∆R between the charged leptons from W
and Z decay is larger than 0.3, and that ∆R between the two leptons from the Z decay is larger than 0.2.

The integrated cross section, measured in the ﬁducial region of the detector, is extrapolated to a total phase
space, deﬁned by requiring that the invariant mass of the lepton pair associated with the Z boson decay is
in the range 66 < mZ < 116 GeV, and extrapolating to all decay channels of the W and Z bosons.
In order to deﬁne the VBS ﬁducial region for the cross-section measurement, in addition to the inclusive
ﬁducial criteria, at least two jets with a pT greater than 30 GeV and an absolute value of the pseudorapidity
η j below 4.5 are required. These particle level jets are deﬁned using the anti-kt algorithm with a radius
parameter R = 0.4. The angular distance between all selected leptons and jets, ∆R( j, (cid:96)), is required to be
greater than 0.3. If the ∆R( j, (cid:96)) requirement is not satisﬁed, the jet is discarded. The invariant mass of the
two leading jets, m j j, must be above 500 GeV to enhance the sensitivity to VBS processes.
For setting limits on aQGC, the ﬁducial region deﬁnition was optimized to give the best expected limits.
Therefore, in addition to the criteria used for the VBS ﬁducial cross-section measurement, it is required
that the diﬀerence in azimuthal angle |∆φ(W, Z)| between the W and Z directions is greater than 2 rad. In
addition, in order to increase the sensitivity to aQGC signals, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta

of the three charged leptons associated with the W and Z bosons,(cid:80)|p(cid:96)

T|, is greater than 250 GeV.

A summary of the phase-space deﬁnition used in this paper is given in Table 1.

4 Standard Model predictions for W±Z production

The measured integrated cross section is compared with the SM NLO prediction from the Powheg event
generator [17–20], interfaced with Pythia 8.175 [21] for parton showering (PS) and hadronization. The
Powheg MC event generator implements the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the production
of electroweak vector boson pairs at hadron colliders, including the full spin and decay angle correla-
√
tions [22]. This calculation is referred to as Powheg+Pythia later on. At a center-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV, in proton–proton collisions, the SM NLO cross section for W±Z production in the ﬁducial
phase space deﬁned in Section 3, estimated with Powheg+Pythia using factorization and dynamic renor-
malization scales µR and µF equal to mWZ/2, where mWZ is the invariant mass of the WZ system, and the
CT10 [23] PDF set, is

= 18.8 ± 0.5 (PDF) ± 0.8 (scale) fb,

= 11.1 ± 0.5 (PDF) ± 0.5 (scale) fb.

In these estimates, the W and Z decays in a single leptonic channel with muons or electrons are consid-
ered. The uncertainty due to the PDF is computed using the eigenvectors of the CT10 PDF set scaled to
68% conﬁdence level (CL) and the envelope of the diﬀerences between the results obtained with CT10,
MSTW 2008 [24], NNPDF 3.0 [25], and ATLAS-epWZ12 NLO [26] PDF sets. The QCD scale uncer-
tainty is estimated conventionally by varying µR and µF by factors of two around the nominal scale mWZ/2
with the constraint 0.5 ≤ µR/µF ≤ 2. A maximum variation of the cross section of 4% is found. However,
the SM prediction, which is at NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD, is highly sensitive to the choice of

6

renormalization scale µR. For example, choosing a ﬁxed renormalization scale of µR = (mW + mZ)/2
instead of a dynamic scale µR = mWZ increases the SM predicted cross section by 7%. The total uncer-
tainty on the theoretical prediction is estimated as the linear sum of the PDF and QCD scale uncertainties,
following the recommendations in Ref. [27].

The diﬀerential distributions are compared to the predictions of the Powheg+Pythia, MC@NLO 4.0 [28],
interfaced with Herwig [29] for PS and hadronization, and Sherpa 1.4.5 [30, 31] event generators. The
Sherpa predictions used in this paper are computed at LO and take into account the real emission of
up to three partons in the matrix element calculations. They are therefore expected to describe the jet
multiplicity distribution and the event kinematics at higher jet multiplicity better than Powheg+Pythia
where only the real emission of at most one parton is directly calculated at NLO.

The uncertainties on predicted diﬀerential cross sections arising from the PDF and the QCD scale uncer-
tainties are estimated as described above. Recently, approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (¯nNLO)
corrections have been computed and presented as K-factors for diﬀerential cross-section distributions [9].
For a number of commonly used observables these corrections are sizable, of the order of 30% to 100%.
The ¯nNLO correction to the mWZ
distribution is smaller (< 10%) indicating that this observable is less
T
sensitive to higher order perturbative contributions to the transition amplitude that appear at next-to-next-
to-leading order (NNLO). The approximate ¯nNLO calculation can only account for the dominant part of
the NNLO QCD corrections and in certain regions of the phase space.
Electroweak quantum corrections at NLO to the W±Z cross sections, including photon-quark-induced
processes, have been computed [10, 11]. These corrections have an impact mainly on diﬀerential cross
sections. The complete calculation is done in the zero-width approximation and the decays of vector
bosons are not included. It is therefore not included in the available Monte Carlo (MC) generators. For
this reason, the uncertainty on the diﬀerential distributions arising from missing higher orders in the EW
theory is included by taking the existing EW corrections at NLO as an additional theory uncertainty on
the predictions from Powheg+Pythia. The eﬀect increases with increasing pZ
T . At a center-of-
mass energy of 8 TeV, they range from −0.3% to a value of 3.2% in the highest pZ
T bin considered in this
analysis and from 0.12% to a value of 1.1% in the highest mWZ
T bin considered in this analysis [11]. The
total uncertainty on the diﬀerential theoretical predictions is estimated as the linear sum of the PDF, QCD
scale, and EW correction uncertainties [27].

T and mWZ

The SM cross section of the VBS process is calculated at NLO in QCD with the Monte Carlo generator
VBFNLO [32–36]. In proton–proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV this cross section
in the VBS ﬁducial phase space deﬁned in Section 3 is 0.13 ± 0.01 fb. This calculated cross section is
for one single leptonic decay channel of the W and Z in muons or electrons. The total uncertainty on the
VBS theoretical prediction is estimated as the linear sum of the PDF and QCD scale uncertainties, each
determined as described above.

5 Simulated event samples

Simulated event samples are used for estimates of the irreducible background, for the correction of the
signal yield for detector eﬀects, for the extrapolation from the ﬁducial to the total phase space, for the
extraction of the gauge couplings, and for comparisons of the results to the theoretical expectations.

The simulated samples are overlaid with additional proton–proton interactions (pileup) generated with
Pythia 8.1 using the MSTW2008 LO PDF set and the A2 [37] set of tuned parameters. The MC events

7

are also reweighted to better reproduce the distribution of the mean number of interactions per bunch
crossing and of the longitudinal position of the primary pp collision vertex observed in the data. All
generated events are passed through the ATLAS detector simulation [38] based on GEANT4 [39] and
processed using the same reconstruction software as for data.

Scale factors are applied to the simulated events to correct for the small diﬀerences from data in the trigger,
reconstruction, and identiﬁcation eﬃciencies for electrons and muons [40–42]. Furthermore, in simulated
events the electron energy and the muon momentum are smeared to account for the small diﬀerences in
resolution between data and simulation [42, 43].

5.1 Signal samples
The W±Z SM production processes and subsequent leptonic decays are generated at NLO in QCD using
the Powheg MC event generator [17–20], interfaced with Pythia 8.175 [21] for PS, hadronization and the
underlying event (UE) simulation. This sample is used to correct for acceptance and detector eﬀects.

Signal events with aTGC are generated at NLO with the MC@NLO 4.0 [28] Monte Carlo generator
interfaced with Herwig [29] and JIMMY [44] for the simulation of the PS, hadronization, and UE.

In all above-mentioned signal samples, the ﬁnal-state radiation (FSR) resulting from the quantum elec-
trodynamics (QED) interaction is modeled with Photos [45].
For the VBS analysis, the W±Z production associated with at least two jets is generated at LO with Sherpa
1.4.5 [30, 31], which uses the CKKW [46] matching scheme and an internal model for QED radiation
based on the YFS method [47]. Signal events in the VBS analysis arise from the processes that occur at
zero-order in the strong coupling constant αs and are labeled WZ j j-EW. The remaining processes leading
to W±Z ﬁnal states, associated with at least two jets, are called WZ j j-QCD processes.
Events with aQGC are generated at LO using the Whizard [48] MC generator. A K-matrix unitarization
method [49, 50] is employed in order to ensure the unitarity of the scattering amplitude, which would be
violated for values of quartic gauge couplings diﬀerent from the SM value.

The CT10 [23] PDF set is used for all signal samples.

5.2 Background samples
Backgrounds to the W±Z signal come from events with two or more electroweak gauge bosons, top
quarks and gauge bosons associated with jets (V + j, V = W, Z), and events from double parton scattering
(DPS) processes where the W±Z signature results from collisions between two pairs of partons producing
a single W and a single Z boson. In the VBS analysis the WZ j j-QCD process is a background to the
WZ j j-EW production. Interference eﬀects between WZ j j-QCD and WZ j j-EW processes are expected
to be negligible and are therefore not considered.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to compute the contribution from processes with at least three prompt
leptons and for comparison with the data-driven estimation of the contribution from background processes
with at least one misidentiﬁed lepton.
The q¯q → ZZ(∗) processes are generated at NLO with Powheg interfaced with Pythia 8.175 or at leading
order (LO) with Sherpa 1.4.5, which includes up to three partons in the matrix element calculation. The

8

ﬁrst sample is used in the inclusive analysis, the second in the VBS analysis. The gg → ZZ(∗) process
is simulated with GG2ZZ at LO [51] interfaced with Herwig [29] for the simulation of the PS and of
the hadronization and JIMMY [44] for the UE. Processes with three gauge bosons are simulated with
MadGraph [52] interfaced with Pythia. The associated production of top pairs with a weak gauge boson
is simulated with MadGraph interfaced with Pythia and the associated production of a single top and a
Z boson is simulated with Sherpa. The total predictions of these MC samples are rescaled to match NLO
predictions from Refs. [53, 54] and Ref. [55], respectively.

The contribution from DPS processes is estimated using Pythia MC samples generated with two hard
scatterings with single-boson production processes (W, Z/γ∗). The cross section of the DPS samples
is estimated using its factorization into the product of two single scattering cross sections [56] and the
eﬀective area parameter for hard double-parton interactions recently measured by ATLAS [57].

Alpgen [58] interfaced with JIMMY [44] and Sherpa [30] samples are used to model the W + j and Z + j
backgrounds, respectively. Top pair production is simulated with Powheg+Pythia. The WW diboson
production is modeled with Powheg+Pythia and GG2WW+Herwig. Alpgen and Sherpa are used to
model Wγ and Zγ diboson production, respectively.

The set of PDF used to generate Alpgen and MadGraph samples is CTEQ6L1 [59] while the CT10 [23]
PDF set is used to generate all the other background samples.

6 Data sample and selections

The data set was collected in 2012 during pp collisions at
s = 8 TeV. It only includes data recorded
with stable beam conditions and with all relevant subdetector systems operational, and corresponds to a
total integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb−1. The absolute luminosity scale is derived from beam-separation
scans performed in November 2012. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is 1.9% [60].

√

Data events are selected by requiring at least one electron or muon candidate. The electron and muon
triggers impose a pT threshold of 24 GeV along with an isolation requirement on the lepton. In order to
increase the eﬃciency for high-pT leptons, the electron and muon triggers are complemented by single-
electron or single-muon triggers with no isolation requirement and with a threshold of 60 GeV or 36 GeV,
respectively. Events are required to have at least one primary vertex reconstructed from at least three
tracks, where the tracks must have a pT greater than 400 MeV.
from W±Z leptonic decays are considered. In the follow-
All ﬁnal states with electrons, muons, and Emiss
ing, the diﬀerent ﬁnal states are referred to as µ±µ+µ−, e±µ+µ−, µ±e+e−, and e±e+e−. No requirement on
the number of jets is applied in the inclusive analysis, while jets are explicitly required in the dedicated
analysis in order to enhance the contribution from the VBS process.

6.1 Object reconstruction and selection

Muon candidates are identiﬁed by tracks or track segments reconstructed in the muon spectrometer system
and matched to tracks reconstructed in the inner detector [42]. The pT of the muon must be greater than
15 GeV and its |η| less than 2.5. The ratio between the transverse impact parameter d0 (with respect to
the primary vertex) to its uncertainty (d0 signiﬁcance) must be smaller than 3 and the longitudinal impact
parameter |z0 · sin(θ)| must be less than 0.5 mm. Isolated muons are then selected with a requirement that

9

the scalar sum of the pT of the tracks within a cone of size ∆R = 0.2 around the muon, excluding the
muon itself, must be less than 15% of the muon pT.
Electron candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the calorimeter and matched to an inner
detector track [40]. The lateral and transverse shapes of the cluster must be consistent with those of an
electromagnetic shower. The pT of the electron must be greater than 15 GeV and the pseudorapidity of the
cluster must be in the ranges |η| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |η| < 2.47. The d0 signiﬁcance of the electron candidate
must be smaller than 6 and the longitudinal impact parameter |z0 · sin(θ)| must be less than 0.5 mm. To
ensure that the electron candidate is isolated, the total transverse energy ET, corrected for pileup eﬀects,
in an isolation cone of ∆R = 0.2 around the electron candidate and excluding the electron itself must
be less than 14% of the electron ET. The scalar sum of the pT of all tracks excluding the electron track
itself within the isolation cone must be less than 13% of the electron pT. If an electron overlaps with a
muon candidate within ∆R = 0.1, the electron is rejected. This criterion mainly removes photons from
ﬁnal-state radiation and jets misidentiﬁed as electrons.

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm [61] with a radius parameter R = 0.4 using topological
clusters of energy deposition in the calorimeter. Jets arising from detector noise or noncollision events
are rejected [62]. Jets are calibrated and corrected for detector eﬀects using a combination of simulated
events and in situ methods [62–64]. The jet energies are also corrected to account for energy arising from
pileup [65]. In order to reject jets from pileup, the summed scalar pT of tracks associated with both the
jet and the primary vertex is required to be greater than 50% of the summed scalar pT of all the tracks
associated with the jet [65]. This criterion is applied to jets with pT smaller than 50 GeV and within
|η| < 2.4. The presence of jets with pT > 30 GeV and a pseudorapidity |η j| < 4.5, is explicitly required
only in the VBS analysis. Jets overlapping with an electron or muon candidate within ∆R = 0.3 are
rejected.
The missing transverse momentum, Emiss
in the event is calculated as the negative vector sum of the
transverse momentum of calibrated leptons, photons, and jets, and additional low-energy deposits in the
calorimeter [66, 67]. The contribution of the low-energy deposits from soft particles to the Emiss
is further
corrected to mitigate the eﬀect of pileup on the Emiss

reconstruction performance [68].

6.2 Event selection

Events are required to contain at least three lepton candidates satisfying the selection criteria described
above.

In order to decrease the background from ZZ processes, events containing four or more candidate leptons
satisfying a looser pT requirement of pT > 7 GeV are discarded.
To ensure that the trigger eﬃciency is well determined, at least one of the candidate leptons is required to
have pT > 25 GeV and to be geometrically matched to a lepton that triggered the event.
The event must have at least one pair of leptons of the same ﬂavor and opposite charge, with an invariant
mass that is consistent with the nominal Z boson mass [16] within 10 GeV. This pair is considered as a Z
boson candidate. If more than one pair is found, the pair whose invariant mass is closest to the nominal Z
boson mass is taken as the Z boson candidate. The third lepton is assigned to the W boson.

To reduce the Z + j background, the lepton assigned to the W boson is required to satisfy more stringent
criteria than those required for the leptons attributed to the Z boson. The pT threshold for this lepton is

10

increased to 20 GeV. In addition, electrons must satisfy tighter identiﬁcation criteria that include require-
ments on the transverse impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex and on the number of hits in
the innermost pixel layer in order to reject photon conversions. In addition, the size of the lepton isolation
cones is increased to ∆R = 0.3 and the sum of the pT of the tracks in the isolation cone of the lepton must
be less than 10% of the lepton pT. Finally, the transverse mass of the W candidate computed using the
Emiss
T

and the pT of the third lepton is required to be above 30 GeV.

To select VBS event candidates, in addition to the above-mentioned selection criteria, the presence of
at least two jets with pT greater than 30 GeV with an absolute value of η less than 4.5 is required. The
invariant mass of the two leading jets must be above 500 GeV and the angular distance between all
selected leptons and jets is required to be greater than 0.3.

For the search of aQGC, in addition to the selection criteria applied in the VBS analysis, it is required
that the diﬀerence in azimuthal angle between the reconstructed W and Z directions is greater than 2 rad
and that the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the three charged leptons associated with the W and
Z bosons is greater than 250 GeV.

7 Background estimation

The background sources are classiﬁed into two groups: events where at least one of the candidate leptons
is not a prompt lepton (reducible background) and events where all candidates are prompt leptons (irre-
ducible background). Candidates that are not prompt leptons are called also “misidentiﬁed” or “fake”
leptons.
Events in the ﬁrst group originate from Z + j, Zγ, t¯t, and WW production processes. This background is
estimated with a data-driven method based on the inversion of a global matrix containing the eﬃciencies
and the misidentiﬁcation probabilities for prompt and fake leptons (see Section 7.1). In the inclusive
analysis, this contribution represents about half of the total backgrounds. About 2% of this background
contribution arises from events with two fake leptons. The background from events with three fake
leptons, e.g., from multijet processes, is negligible.
The events contributing to the second group originate from ZZ, t¯t + V, VVV (where V = Z or W), tZ( j)
events, and DPS processes. The amount of irreducible background is estimated using MC simulations due
to the low cross sections of the corresponding processes and the statistical limitations of estimates using
data-driven methods. In the inclusive analysis the dominant contribution in this second group is from ZZ
production and represents about 70% of the irreducible background. The MC-based estimation of the ZZ
background is validated by comparing data and MC simulation in properly deﬁned control regions (see
Section 7.2).

The main background in the VBS analysis originates from the processes deﬁned as WZ j j-QCD in Sec-
tion 5.1 and amounts to ∼ 70% of the total backgrounds. The second most important background contri-
bution arises from the tZ j process and amounts to ∼ 10% of the total estimated background.
Interference eﬀects between the WZ j j-QCD and tZ j background processes and the VBS signal (WZ j j-
EW) are expected to be negligible. The treatment of the tZ j background is further discussed in Sec-
tion 11.3. In the VBS analysis, background events due to misidentiﬁed leptons and due to ZZ events
amount to about 9% and 7% of the total background, respectively.

11

7.1 Background from misidentiﬁed leptons (Z + j, Zγ, t ¯t, WW)

The matrix method [69] is a data-driven method for the calculation of the reducible background which
exploits the classiﬁcation of the leptons as loose (L) or tight (T) candidates and the probability that a fake
lepton is misidentiﬁed as a loose or tight lepton.

Three-lepton events in the WZ data sample, selected as explained in Section 6.2, but relaxing some of
the lepton identiﬁcation criteria, are classiﬁed into eight categories. Each category contains a number
of events, Nαβγ, where the ﬁrst index refers always to the W lepton, the second to the Z leading lepton,
and the third to the Z trailing lepton. Each index can be L or T depending on whether the corresponding
lepton met only the loose identiﬁcation criteria or satisﬁed the tight ones. Loose leptons are leptons that
survive the overlap removal criteria (as described in Section 6.1) but do not meet the isolation criteria,
while tight leptons are signal leptons as deﬁned in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. These eight categories are called
identiﬁcation categories here. The number of events in each category, Nαβγ, is measured directly in
data.

The same WZ data sample of three-lepton events can be decomposed in eight true categories according
to the nature of each lepton as prompt or nonprompt. Each category contains a number of events, Ni jk,
where each index, ordered as described above, can be R or F depending on the kind of corresponding
lepton (prompt, R, or nonprompt, F). The number of events in each category Ni jk is the result of the
matrix method calculation.

The number of events, Nαβγ, in each identiﬁcation category is related to the number of events Ni jk of the
true categories by an 8×8 matrix expressed in terms of the probability that a prompt lepton is identiﬁed as
a tight (loose) lepton, denoted here by e (¯e = 1 − e), and the probability that a fake lepton is misidentiﬁed
as a tight (loose) lepton, denoted here by f ( ¯f = 1 − f ). The matrix reduces to a 7 × 7 matrix since the
category NFFF can be neglected, the number of events with three misidentiﬁed leptons being more than
two orders of magnitude smaller than the number of those with only one misidentiﬁed lepton. The value
of f is small, therefore terms with order higher than two in f can be neglected. It has been veriﬁed that
these simpliﬁcations do not change the ﬁnal result.

The matrix is inverted to obtain the number of events with at least one misidentiﬁed lepton, which repre-
sents the amount of reducible background in the WZ sample, Nreducible

, and the index i = 1, 2, 3 refers to the W lepton, the Z leading lepton
αβγ
and the Z trailing lepton, respectively. The value of Nαβγ is obtained by counting the number of WZ
events in the selected data sample with leptons satisfying the loose or tight criteria. The variable Nirr.
αβγ
represents the number of events with three prompt leptons in the corresponding identiﬁcation category
αβγ and is estimated using MC simulation. The values of Fi are measured diﬀerentially as a function of
the lepton transverse momentum, using W + j or Z + j control samples taken from data for F1 or for F2
and F3, respectively. The eﬃciencies e(¯e) do not appear in Eq. (2) since they are included in the Nirr.
αβγ
term.

The control samples and the reducible background in the WZ sample are composed of events with
misidentiﬁed leptons from light- or heavy-ﬂavor jets and from photon conversions. The data-driven
estimates of the Fi factors correspond to an average value weighted by the abundance of each kind of
background and may vary depending on the composition of the sample used to extract them. For this

12

reason, data samples enriched in the diﬀerent types of background have been used to verify that the back-
ground composition in the above-deﬁned W + j and Z + j control samples is the same, within uncertainties,
as in the signal region.

Other methods to assess the reducible background have been considered and provide results in good
agreement with the matrix method estimation.

7.2 Background from ZZ processes

The ZZ background is estimated using MC simulation, as explained in Section 5.2. The number of ex-
pected ZZ events from Powheg is scaled by 1.05 to account for NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections [10,
11, 70]. In the VBS analysis, the scale factor used for Sherpa is taken to be 1.0 since Sherpa incorporates
matrix element calculations up to three partons.

These estimations are validated by comparing the MC expectations with the event yield and several kine-
matic distributions of a data sample enriched in ZZ events. The ZZ control sample is selected by requiring
a Z candidate meeting all the analysis selection criteria accompanied by two additional leptons of the same
ﬂavor and opposite charge, satisfying the lepton criteria described in Section 6.1. The comparisons are
performed in the above-deﬁned control region and in a subregion where at least two jets are present in
addition. In the ﬁrst case, the data are compared with the predictions from Powheg and GG2ZZ Monte
Carlo simulations, while in the second case Sherpa and GG2ZZ Monte Carlo samples are used. Overall
the agreement between the data and the expectations is within one standard deviation of the experimen-
tal uncertainty. The shapes of main kinematic variables are also found to be well described by the MC
expectations.

The expectations based on MC simulation are scaled to the integrated luminosity of the data using the
predicted cross sections of each sample. The Powheg+Pythia MC prediction is used for the W±Z signal
contribution. In Figure 1 it is scaled by a global factor of 1.17 to match the measured inclusive W±Z cross
section of Section 11.1. This scaling is only used for an illustrative purpose in this Figure and does not
aﬀect the measurements. Table 3 shows the number of expected and observed events together with the
estimated background contributions for the VBS and aQGC analyses, respectively. Figure 1 indicates that
the MC predictions provide a fair description of the shapes of the data distributions.

where Ndata and Nbkg are the number of observed events and the estimated number of background events,
respectively, L is the integrated luminosity, and CWZ, obtained from simulation, is the ratio of the number
of selected signal events at detector level to the number of events at particle level in the ﬁducial phase
space. This factor corrects for detector eﬃciencies and for QED ﬁnal-state radiation eﬀects. The contribu-
tion from τ lepton decays, amounting approximately to 4%, is removed from the cross-section deﬁnition
by introducing the term in parenthesis. This term is computed using simulation, where Nτ is the number
of selected events in which at least one of the bosons decays into a τ lepton and Nall is the number of
selected WZ events with decays into any lepton.

where BW = 10.86 ± 0.09 % and BZ = 3.3658 ± 0.0023 % are the W and Z leptonic branching frac-
tions [16], respectively, and AWZ is the acceptance factor calculated at particle level as the ratio of the
number of events in the ﬁducial phase space to the number of events in the total phase space as deﬁned in
Section 3.
A single acceptance factor of AWZ = 0.395 ± 0.001 (stat.), obtained by averaging the acceptance factors
computed in the µee and eµµ channels, is used since it has been veriﬁed that interference eﬀects related to
the presence of identical leptons in the ﬁnal state, as in the eee and µµµ channels, are below 1%. The use
of the µee and eµµ channels for the computation of AWZ avoids the ambiguity arising from the assignment
at particle level of ﬁnal-state leptons to the W and Z bosons.

The diﬀerential detector-level distributions are corrected for detector resolution and for QED FSR eﬀects
using an iterative Bayesian unfolding method [71], as implemented in the RooUnfold toolkit [72]. Three

16

iterations were consistently used for the unfolding of each variable. The width of the bins in each dis-
tribution was chosen according to the experimental resolution and to the statistical signiﬁcance of the
expected number of events in each bin. For the data distributions used to extract the limits on anomalous
gauge couplings, a dedicated bin optimization was performed using signal MC events, in order to reach
the best sensitivity for the ﬁtted parameters. The fraction of signal MC events reconstructed in each bin
is always greater than 50% and around 60% on average.

Simulated signal events are used to obtain for each distribution a response matrix that accounts for bin-
to-bin migration eﬀects between the reconstructed-level and particle-level distributions. In the inclusive
measurements, the Powheg+Pythia signal sample is used since it provides a fair description of the data
distributions. For the jet multiplicity diﬀerential measurement and in the VBS analysis, the Sherpa signal
sample is used for the computation of the response matrix since this sample includes up to three partons
in the matrix element calculation and therefore better describes the jet multiplicity of data. To build the
response matrix for the unfolding of the jet multiplicity, the pT threshold of the particle level jets, as
deﬁned in Section 3, is set to 25 GeV. This threshold is similar to the one used in the recent measurement
of the WW cross section by the ATLAS Collaboration [73]. A jet pT threshold of 30 GeV, corresponding to
the deﬁnition of the VBS phase space, is, however, used for the unfolding of the invariant mass spectrum
of the two leading jets.

10 Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties on the integrated and diﬀerential cross sections are due to uncertainties of
experimental and theoretical nature on the acceptance, on the correction procedure for detector eﬀects,
on the background estimation and on the luminosity.

The systematic uncertainties on the AWZ and CWZ factors due to the theoretical modeling in the event
generators are evaluated taking into account the uncertainties related to the choice of the PDF, QCD
renormalization and factorization scales, and of the parton showering simulation. Uncertainties due to the
choice of PDF are computed using the CT10 eigenvectors and the envelope of the diﬀerences between
CT10, MSTW 2008, NNPDF 3.0, and ATLAS-epWZ12 PDF sets. QCD scale uncertainties are estimated
by varying µR and µF by factors of two around the nominal scale mWZ/2 with the constraint 0.5 ≤ µR/µF ≤
2. Uncertainties due to the choice of parton showering model are estimated by interfacing Powheg with
either Pythia or Herwig and comparing the results. These uncertainties of theoretical nature have no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the CWZ factors but aﬀect the AWZ acceptance factor, where the dominant contribution
originates from the PDF choice and is below 1.3%.

The uncertainty on the diﬀerential distributions arising from the MC modeling of the response matrix in
the unfolding procedure is estimated by reweighting simulated events at particle level to the unfolded re-
sults obtained as described in Section 9. An alternative response matrix is deﬁned using these reweighted
MC events and is used to unfold Powheg+Pythia reconstructed MC events. A systematic uncertainty is
estimated by comparing this unfolded distribution to the original particle-level Powheg+Pythia predic-
tion.

The experimental systematic uncertainty on the CWZ factors and on the unfolding procedure includes
uncertainties on the electron energy or muon momentum scale and resolution, on the Emiss
scale and
resolution, on the jet energy scale and resolution, as well as uncertainties on the scale factors applied to
the simulation in order to reproduce the trigger, reconstruction, identiﬁcation, and isolation eﬃciencies

T

17

measured in data. The uncertainty associated with the pileup reweighting procedure is negligible. For the
measurements of the W charge-dependent cross sections, an uncertainty arising from the charge misiden-
tiﬁcation of leptons is also considered. It aﬀects only electrons and leads to uncertainties of ∼ 0.1%
on the integrated cross section combining all decay channels. The systematic uncertainties on the mea-
sured cross section are determined by repeating the analysis after applying appropriate variations for each
source of systematic uncertainty to the simulated samples.

The lepton energy or momentum scale corrections are obtained from a comparison of the Z boson in-
variant mass distribution in data and simulations, while the uncertainties on the eﬃciency scale factors
are derived from a comparison of tag-and-probe results in data and simulations [40–42]. Uncertainties
on the jet energy scale are determined from a combination of methods based on simulation and in situ
techniques [62, 63]. The uncertainty on the jet energy resolution is derived from a comparison of the res-
olutions obtained in data and in simulated dijet events [64]. The uncertainty on the Emiss
is estimated by
propagating the uncertainties on the objects and by applying energy scale and resolution uncertainties to
the calorimeter energy clusters that are not associated with a jet or an electron. The dominant contribution
among the experimental systematic uncertainties in the eee and µee channels derives from the electron
identiﬁcation eﬃciency, being at most 2.9%, while in the eµµ and µµµ channels it originates from the
muon reconstruction eﬃciency and is at most 2.1%.

T

The uncertainty on the amount of background from misidentiﬁed leptons is estimated taking into account
the statistical uncertainties on the event yields in each identiﬁcation category and on the Fi factors (see
Section 7.1). Uncertainties arising from the deﬁnition of the W + j and Z + j control samples and from
their composition are also included. The former are evaluated by changing the control sample selection
criteria and the latter by using a diﬀerent way of computing the fake rate, which relies on a matrix method
where the matrix is obtained using particle-level information.

An uncertainty of 7% on the amount of ZZ background is evaluated as the diﬀerence between the pre-
dicted and measured numbers of ZZ events in the deﬁned control regions. The uncertainty arising from
other kinds of irreducible backgrounds is evaluated by propagating the uncertainty on their MC cross
section which are estimated to be 30%, 15% and 50% for t¯t + V, tZ, and DPS processes, respectively.

The uncertainty on the unfolding procedure arising from the limited number of events in the simulation
is estimated using pseudoexperiments.

The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity [74] is applied to the signal normalization as well as to all
background contributions that are estimated using MC simulations. It results in an eﬀect of 2.2% on the
measured cross sections.
The overall uncertainty on the single-channel W±Z ﬁducial cross section varies from approximately 6%
to 8%. Table 5 shows the statistical and main systematic uncertainties on the W±Z ﬁducial cross section
for each of the four channels and for their combination.

where the uncertainties correspond to statistical, systematic and luminosity uncertainties, respectively.
The measurement is to be compared to the SM expectation of 30.0 ± 2.1 fb from Powheg+Pythia, as
discussed in Section 4. The measured W±Z production cross sections are compared to the SM NLO
prediction from Powheg+Pythia in Figure 2 and all results for W±Z, W +Z, and W−Z ﬁnal states are
reported in Table 6.

The measured cross section is larger than the quoted SM prediction. However, the SM prediction, which
is at NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD, is highly sensitive to the choice of renormalization scale µR. In
addition, new perturbative eﬀects appearing at NNLO could enhance the SM prediction compared to the
NLO calculation. Indeed, for the other diboson ﬁnal states ZZ, WW, Zγ, and Wγ NNLO calculations have
recently become available [70, 76–78] and in all cases the NNLO corrections were found to be positive
and larger than the uncertainty on the NLO calculation estimated by the conventional independent up and
down variations of µR and µF by a factor of two.

11.2 Diﬀerential cross sections

For the measurements of the diﬀerential distributions, all four decay channels, eee, eµµ, µee, and µµµ,
are added together. The resulting distributions are unfolded with a response matrix computed using a
Powheg+Pythia MC signal sample that includes all four topologies and divided by four such that cross
sections refer to ﬁnal states where the W and Z decay in a single leptonic channel with muons or elec-
trons.
The W±Z production cross section is measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z and W
boson, pZ
(Figure 5), as
a function of the pT of the neutrino associated with the decay of the W boson, pν
T, and as a function of the
absolute diﬀerence between the rapidities of the Z boson and the lepton from the decay of the W boson,
|yZ − y(cid:96),W| (Figure 6).
The diﬀerential cross sections as a function of the transverse momenta of the neutrino or of the lepton
from the W decay are interesting because of their sensitivity to the polarization of the W boson. Exper-
imentally, given the ﬁducial phase space of the measurement, the pν
T observable has the advantage of
probing lower transverse momenta than the transverse momentum of the lepton from the W boson decay,

Previously, no observable related to decay angles of ﬁnal-state particles had been measured for WZ events.
The rapidity correlations between the W and Z decay products have been found to be useful tools in
searching for the approximately zero WZ helicity amplitudes expected at LO in the SM or for aTGC [7,
8]. These rapidity correlations are also sensitive to QCD corrections, PDF eﬀects, and polarization eﬀects
of the W and Z bosons. The rapidity diﬀerence between the W and Z bosons, |yZ−yW|, is a boost-invariant
substitute for the center-of-mass scattering angle θ of the W with respect to the direction of the incoming
quark. Since the rapidity of the W boson cannot be uniquely reconstructed due to the presence of the
neutrino, the rapidity of the lepton from the W boson decay is used. Therefore the rapidity diﬀerence
|yZ − y(cid:96),W| is measured instead of |yZ − yW|.
The W +Z/W−Z ratio of the production cross sections is also measured as a function of pZ
and |yZ − y(cid:96),W| and presented in Figures 7, 8, and 9.
The measured diﬀerential cross sections are compared to the predictions from the Powheg+Pythia MC
generator, which uses the CT10 PDF set and dynamic QCD scales of µF = µR = mWZ/2. The theoret-

and QCD scales and are evaluated as explained in Section 4. The total uncertainty on the theoretical
predictions is estimated as the linear sum of the PDF, parton shower, QCD scale and EW correction
uncertainties, following the recommendations of Ref. [27]. The measured cross-section distributions are
also compared to predictions from the MC@NLO and Sherpa MC event generators.
Fair agreement of the shapes of measured distributions of inclusive cross sections and W +Z/W−Z cross
section ratios with the diﬀerent MC predictions is observed. However, the precision of SM predictions of
W±Z production is limited to NLO and LO accuracy for perturbative QCD and EW eﬀects, respectively.
New eﬀects of higher perturbative orders could therefore potentially aﬀect the present SM predictions,
beyond the presently estimated theoretical uncertainties. From the pν
T diﬀerential cross section in Fig-
ure 6(a) we observe that the global excess of the measured integrated cross section compared to the
Powheg+Pythia prediction seems to be related to the region with pν
T < 50 GeV, this diﬀerence being
more pronounced for pν

T < 30 GeV for W−Z events as seen in the ﬁrst bin of Figure 9(a).

The exclusive multiplicity of jets unfolded at particle level is presented in Figure 10. This distribution

of 25 GeV at detector and at particle level. The measurement is compared with predictions from Sherpa

while this is not the case for Powheg+Pythia and MC@NLO. Moreover, the ratio of 0-jet to 1-jet event
cross sections predicted by Powheg+Pythia is lower than predicted by Sherpa and than measured in data.
Finally, the measured W±Z diﬀerential cross section as a function of the invariant mass, m j j, of the two
leading jets with pT > 30 GeV is presented in Figure 11. The measurement is better described by the
Sherpa prediction, which includes the sum of WZ j j-QCD and WZ j j-EW contributions. The contribution
of WZ j j-EW events, which is increasing at higher m j j is exempliﬁed in the ﬁgure.

11.3 Limits on vector boson scattering production

This part of the analysis aims to study WZ j j-EW production, which includes VBS and tZ j processes.
The latter process results from a t-channel exchange of a W boson between a b and a u-quark giving a
ﬁnal state with a t-quark, a Z boson and a light quark jet, but does not exhibit diagrams with gauge boson
couplings. Its contribution in the Sherpa WZ j j-EW sample is disentangled from the VBS part, considered
in this paper as the signal, with a splitting procedure relying on the presence of b-quarks at generator
level. Interference eﬀects between the signal and the tZ j process are expected to be negligible. Since the
b-tagged sample, enriched in tZ j events, still contains a small fraction (∼ 5%) of signal events from the

Given a too-low expected statistical signiﬁcance for a cross-section measurement, the experimental result
is reported as an upper limit at 95% CL on the ﬁducial cross section multiplied by the W and Z branching
ratios in a single leptonic channel with muons or electrons. Observed and expected upper limits are

To extract the aTGC, two model-independent parameterizations of possible eﬀects beyond the SM are fol-
lowed. The ﬁrst makes use of an eﬀective Lagrangian describing the WWZ vertex and includes only terms
that separately conserve the charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) quantum numbers [79, 80]. The devia-
tion of the vector boson WWZ couplings from the SM predicted values are introduced as dimensionless
anomalous couplings ∆κZ, ∆gZ

1 , and λZ.

Without eﬀects not described by the SM, the anomalous terms cause a violation of the unitarity bound
in the interaction amplitudes. To prevent this violation, the anomalous couplings are introduced as form
co)2, where α(0) is the
factors dependent on the partonic center-of-mass energy, ˆs: α( ˆs) = α(0)/(1 + ˆs/Λ2
generic anomalous coupling value at low energy and Λco is a cutoﬀ scale at which physics eﬀects beyond
the SM should manifest.

The second parameterization is based on an eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) in which the particle content of
the SM is not changed and the theory is extended by adding to the SM Lagrangian a linear combination
of operators of mass dimension higher than four [81, 82]. The dimension-six operators are expected to
be dominant. There are three independent dimension-six C- and P-conserving operators that aﬀect the
electroweak vector boson self-interactions and that can lead to anomalous triple vector boson couplings.
The corresponding new terms in the Lagrangian are

where Wi j, Wi j, Wi
j(i = µ, ν, j = ν, ρ), and Bµν are built from the SM electroweak gauge boson ﬁelds,
Di(i = µ, ν) are the covariant derivatives as introduced in the SM, and Φ is the Higgs doublet ﬁeld. The
dimensionless coeﬃcients ci(i = WWW, W, B) and Λ represent the strength of the new couplings and the
energy scale of new physics, respectively. This approach does not require the introduction of arbitrary
form factors to restore unitarity.

The eﬀective ﬁeld theory allows the anomalous couplings to be reinterpreted in terms of the EFT parame-
ters, ci/Λ2(i = WWW, W, B) [83]. For this reason the two parameterizations can be considered equivalent.
They are both used in this analysis because the ﬁrst allows a comparison with previous analyses and the
second is a ﬂexible way of parameterizing eﬀects beyond the SM in a model-independent way. Therefore,
the free parameters considered in this analysis are ∆κZ, ∆gZ
The presence of aTGC would aﬀect the W±Z integrated cross section and manifest itself as an increased
yield of events at high values of pZ
T diﬀerential
distribution at detector level, as presented in Figure 12. The mWZ
distribution is expected to be less
T
sensitive to higher-order QCD and EW eﬀects in perturbation theory (as discussed in Section 4). For this
reason it has smaller theoretical uncertainties than the pZ
T distribution at high values and provides more
stringent expected limits, as proven by a dedicated MC study.
The MC event generator MC@NLO is used to generate W±Z events and to compute, for each event, a set
of weights that are employed to reweight the SM sample to any chosen value of the anomalous couplings,

T . Limits on the aTGC are extracted from the mWZ

1 , and λZ or ci/Λ2(i = WWW, W, B).

distributions are obtained for diﬀerent values
T
of the anomalous couplings, or EFT coeﬃcients. This reweighting procedure is validated by comparing
the SM sample reweighted to a given set of aTGC values with a sample generated using the same set of
aTGC values. A global systematic uncertainty of 10% across all mWZ
bins was included in the aTGC
T
limit extraction procedure to account for the reweighting method.

Frequentist conﬁdence intervals on the anomalous coupling are computed by forming a proﬁle likelihood
test that incorporates the observed and expected numbers of signal events in each bin of the mWZ
T distri-
bution for diﬀerent values of the anomalous couplings. The systematic uncertainties are included in the
likelihood function as nuisance parameters.

1 , and λZ
with the cutoﬀ scale Λco = 2 TeV, Λco = 15 TeV and Λco = ∞ (no cutoﬀ). Each limit is obtained by
setting the other two couplings to the SM value. The Λco value of 15 TeV is the largest form factor scale
that can preserve unitarity for all aTGC in this analysis.
Expected and observed 95% CL limit contours in the planes (∆κZ, ∆gZ
1 , λZ), and (∆κZ, λZ) are
shown in Figure 13. For each of the contours, the third parameter is set to the SM value and the limits are
derived without any cut-oﬀ.

In Figure 14 the present observed limits are compared to limits previously obtained using WZ events
produced in p ¯p collisions at the Tevatron [1, 84] and by ATLAS with
s = 7 TeV pp collisions [3].
The new limits improve previous constraints by factors of 1.5 to 2.5 and are now the most stringent
model-independent limits on WWZ anomalous couplings.

13 Anomalous quartic gauge Couplings

To extract limits on aQGC, the EFT approach introduced in the previous section is used. Several ways of
parameterizing possible deviations with respect to the SM exist. In this analysis, the choice is to express
the deviation using two parameters α4 and α5 following existing notations [49, 85–87]. They are the
coeﬃcients of the two linearly independent dimension-four operators contributing to the quartic gauge
couplings beyond the SM.

The Whizard event generator is used to compute the ratio in the aQGC ﬁducial phase space, at particle
level, of the expected ﬁducial cross section for diﬀerent values of α4 and α5, to the SM cross section.
Whizard includes a unitarization scheme in order to ensure the unitary of the scattering amplitude, which
would be violated for values of the quartic gauge couplings diﬀerent from the SM value.

prediction and the shaded orange band its estimated total uncertainty. The prediction with nonzero values of one of
the aQGC parameters is also represented by the dashed line.

These ratios are multiplied by the SM ﬁducial cross section estimated with Sherpa to obtain the predicted
ﬁducial cross sections as a function of α4 and α5. The Sherpa MC generator is used as reference SM
generator for sake of consistency with the VBS cross-section limit measurement of Section 11.3 and with
a previous search for aQGC using W±W± j j events [88]. The expected ﬁducial cross sections include only
the VBS part of the WZ j j-EW process.

T| that are used to select events in the aQGC ﬁducial
phase space are shown in Figure 15 for events passing the VBS phase space selection. The change of the
shape of these distributions when one of the aQGC parameters has a nonzero value is also shown. After
correcting for the selection eﬃciency, the measured ﬁducial cross section in the aQGC phase space is used
to set limits on the aQGC. The selection eﬃciency is estimated to be ≈ 70% and found to be constant
over the considered α4 and α5 values, within the MC statistical uncertainties. Limits are obtained as for
the aTGC limits of Section 12 from a proﬁle likelihood method that incorporates the systematic uncer-
tainties. The expected and observed two-dimensional limit contours at 95% CL on α4 and α5 are shown
in Figure 16. The present limit is compared to the expected limit obtained by the ATLAS Collaboration
using W±W± j j events [88]. This analysis of W±Z j j events probes a domain of the (α4, α5) parameter
space that could not excluded by the analysis of W±W± j j events.
The limits on (α4, α5) coeﬃcients used in Whizard can be translated to limits on the ( fS ,0/Λ4, fS ,1/Λ4)
coeﬃcients of the OS ,0 and OS ,1 operators of Ref. [89] using the following conversion for the WWZZ
vertex [90]:

where v = 246.22 GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Assuming Λ = 1 TeV and that this
conversion also holds for the K-matrix unitarization, a value of α4(5) = 0.5 corresponds to fS ,0(1) = 2177
for W±Z j j events.

ν (cid:96)(cid:96)

Measurements of W±Z production using
s = 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC are presented. The data
were collected with the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb−1. The
measurements use leptonic decay modes of the gauge bosons to electrons or muons and are performed
in a ﬁducial phase space approximating the detector acceptance. The measured inclusive cross section in

(lumi.) fb, to be compared to next-to-leading-order Standard Model expectation of 30.0 ± 2.1 fb. With a
total experimental relative uncertainty of 4.2%, a precision better than presently available from theoretical
predictions is reached. The measured cross section is found to be slightly larger than the NLO SM
prediction. A comparison to a prediction incorporating full NNLO QCD eﬀects would therefore be of
very interesting.
Furthermore, the W±Z production cross section is measured as a function of each of several kinematic
variables and compared to SM predictions of the Powheg+Pythia, MC@NLO, and Sherpa Monte Carlo
event generators.

couplings and limits on ∆kZ, ∆gZ
compared to previously existing constraints, these are the most stringent model-independent limits on
WWZ anomalous couplings to date. Results are also interpreted as limits on the cW /Λ2, cB/Λ2, and
cWWW /Λ2 coeﬃcients of the EFT parameterization.
Finally, events with a W and a Z boson associated with two or more forward jets have been analyzed and
an upper limit at 95% CL on the W±Z scattering cross section of 0.63 fb for one leptonic decay channel
has been established. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings have also been extracted.
For W±Z production, the measurements presented here are the most precise and complete to date and have
the potential to further constrain existing Standard Model theoretical predictions, which are presently only
available at next-to-leading order in QCD.
