Abstract.
In order to study a one-dimensional analogue of the spontaneous curvature model for
two-component lipid bilayer membranes we consider planar curves that are made of a material with
two phases. Each phase induces a preferred curvature to the curve, and these curvatures as well
as phase boundaries may lead to the development of kinks. We introduce a family of energies for
smooth curves and phase ﬁelds, and we show that these energies Γ-converge to an energy for curves
with a ﬁnite number of kinks. The theoretical result is illustrated by some numerical examples.
Keywords: Γ-convergence, elastic curves, phase ﬁeld model, two-component membrane.

1 Introduction and Result

Integral functionals depending on curvature are of geometric interest and arise in a variety of
applications such as image processing and models for elastic lines or thin shells[18, 17, 3, 12];
in particular, they appear in the study of biological membranes.[5, 9, 16] In the spontaneous-
curvature model for bilayer vesicles with two lipid components equilibrium shapes are described
as surfaces minimising the energy

(cid:88)i=1,2(cid:90)Σi

ai(H − Ci)2 + biK dS + σ|∂Σ1|

(1.1)

among all closed surfaces Σ = Σ1 ∪ Σ2 with ﬁxed areas |Σi| and ﬁxed enclosed volume.[2, 11]
Here H and K are the mean and Gauss curvature of the membrane surface Σ, ai and bi are
parameters related to bending resistance of the membrane, and σ is the line tension at the
component boundary |∂Σi|; the spontaneous curvatures Ci are supposed to reﬂect an asymmetry
in the membrane.

J¨ulicher and Lipowsky[11] study the Euler-Lagrange equations of (1.1) for axially symmetric
membranes with exactly one interface represented by a point on a rotated curve. They brieﬂy
discuss the possibility of diﬀerent smoothness conditions for the curve at the interface, their
analysis, however, is done for smooth membranes only. Du, Wang[6] and Lowengrub, R¨atz,
Voigt[13] perform numerical simulations using a phase ﬁeld for both the membrane and the lipid
components; convergence to the sharp interface model is obtained by asymptotic analysis or
under strong smoothness assumption on the limit surface.

In this paper we are interested in a one-dimensional analogue of the spontaneous-curvature
model for two component vesicles. We consider curves made of a material with two phases,
each of which induces a preferred bending to the curve; in contrast to the above studies for
membranes we do not enforce smoothness of the curves a priori. We analyse an approximation
by more regular curves, which, in particular, can be treated numerically in an easier way than
the model with kinks.

More precisely, we consider closed plane curves q of ﬁxed length L that are twice weakly
diﬀerentiable and regular except for a ﬁnite number of points. These curves can be parametrised
with unit speed over the circle S1, when it is given a scaled standard metric to have length L.

We require that the squared mean curvature κ2

q = |q(cid:48)(cid:48)|2 of q is integrable, so we let
C :=(cid:8)q ∈ C(S1; R2) : there exists a set Sq of ﬁnitely many points s. t.

q ∈ H 2(S1 \ Sq; R2), |q(cid:48)| = 1 in S1 \ Sq(cid:9)

be the set of parametrised curves which may have a ﬁnite number of kinks. Indeed, because H 2
embeds continuously in C 1, Sq is the set of discontinuities of the tangent vector q(cid:48) or, as |q(cid:48)| is
constant, of the tangent angle. Note also that C ⊂ H 1(S1; R2).
The material phases of q ∈ C are determined by a function v : S1 → {±1} having at most a

ﬁnite number of jumps and satisfying the volume constraint

(cid:90)S1

(1.2)
for ﬁxed m ∈ (−1, 1). We denote the set of such functions by P and the jump set of v ∈ P by
Sv; note that P ⊂ BV (S1;{±1}).

v dt = mL

On basis of the membrane model we consider for (q, v) ∈ C × P the energy
(σ + ˆσ|[q(cid:48)](s)|) .

E(q, v) :=(cid:90)S1\(Sq∪Sv)

(κq − C(v))2 dt + (cid:88)s∈Sq∪Sv

(1.3)

Compared to (1.1) we have dropped the Gauss curvature term, as curves have no intrinsic
curvature. Furthermore, for notational simplicity we have set all bending rigidities to one and
let only the spontaneous curvatures C(±1) be phase-dependent. Diﬀerent rigidities can be treated
similar to the spontaneous curvature below.
In (1.3) interfaces without kinks are penalised by the constant energy σ, while kinks carry
an additional “bending energy” ˆσ|[q(cid:48)]|(s) where ˆσ is a constant and |[q(cid:48)](s)| denotes the modulus
of the angle enclosed by the two one-sided tangent vectors at s modulo 2π. Note, that kinks
may not only occur at interfaces, but also within a phase. Such kinks can be seen as resembling
budding transitions or non-smooth limit shapes of even single-component membranes; we shall
call them ghost interfaces.

As an approximation to this model we consider curves from the set

We replace sharp material phases by phase ﬁelds v ∈ H 1(S1) with the constraint (1.2), denoting
this set of functions by Pε. For ε > 0 and (q, v) ∈ Cε × Pε we consider the energy

Cε :=(cid:8)q ∈ H 2(S1; R2) : |q(cid:48)| = 1 in S1(cid:9).

ε Φ(v) dt + ε(cid:90)S1

Eε(q, v) :=(cid:90)S1

(1.4)
where Φ : R → [0,∞) is a continuous double-well potential, that is zero only in ±1 and satisﬁes
Φ(v) → ∞ as v → ±∞. For notational simplicity we assume that Φ is symmetric with respect
to the origin, and for technical reasons that it is C 2 in a neighbourhood of its minima. The
function C : R → R is a continuous and bounded extension of C(±1).
The ﬁrst integral in (1.4) resembles the curvature integral in (1.3); having the phase ﬁeld in
front of the curvature term enables the curves to approach kinks as ε → 0. The third integral,
however, penalises regions of very large curvature and accounts for a kink’s bending energy in
the limit. Finally, interface costs are contributed by the second integral.

Below we show that the ε-energies (1.4) converge to (1.3) with

σ = 2(cid:90) 1

−1(cid:112)Φ(v) dv

and

ˆσ = 2(cid:112)Φ(0).

(1.5)

In order to formulate and prove our theorem we ﬁx these constants as in (1.5). We extend the
energies Eε and E to the space H 1(S1; R2) × L1(S1) by setting Eε(q, v) = E(q, v) = ∞ whenever
(q, v) does not belong to Cε × Pε and C × P, respectively.
Theorem 1.1. The energies Eε are equi-coercive, that is any sequence (qε, vε) ∈ Cε × Pε with
uniformly bounded energy admits a subsequence converging strongly in H 1(S1; R2) × L1(S1) to
some (q, v) ∈ C × P.

Furthermore, the Eε Γ-converge to E as ε → 0, that is

• for any (q, v) there is a sequence (qε, vε) converging to (q, v) in H 1(S1; R2) × L1(S1) such

that

Eε(qε, vε) ≤ E(q, v).

lim sup

ε→0

We postpone the proof of Theorem 1.1 to Section 2 in favour of some remarks and illustrations.
Two examples of a local minimiser of Eε are given in Figure 1.1 for ε = 0.05 and C(v) being a
cubic interpolation of C(−1) = 1, C(+1) = 2, C(cid:48)(±1) = 0; the potential, and therewith the cost
of kinks and interfaces, is Φ(v) = (1 − v2)2 for the left pictures and Φ(v) = 0.75(1 − v2)2 for the
right. Both results are obtained by a gradient ﬂow for Eε with respect to the H−1 norm for the
phase ﬁeld and the L2 norm for the tangent angle; see [10, 8, 7] for details.

In both simulations the initial curve is a circle of radius 2 and the initial phase ﬁeld has mean
value zero with two interface regions. The interfaces are retained during the evolution, but new
small areas of large curvature appear within the phase of spontaneous curvature 2. As already
mentioned, these additional regions may persist as ε tends to zero, giving rise to ghost interfaces.
Between (ghost) interfaces the numerically stationary curve consists of segments of circles whose
curvatures are determined by the phase, but not equal to the preferred ones.
Our second note is the existence of minimisers for E. From the properties of Γ-convergence
and equi-coercivity, see for instance [4], we know that any sequence (qε, vε) ∈ Cε × Pε satisfying

Eε(qε, vε) = inf
Cε×Pε

Eε + o(1),

admits a subsequence converging to a minimiser (q, v) of E in C × P. As the energy (1.4) is
bounded from below, we can always ﬁnd such almost minimising sequences. By the Direct
Method of the Calculus of Variations there exists even a minimiser for each ε > 0, because Eε
is coercive and weakly lower semi-continuous on H 2(S1; R2) × H 1(S1), and Cε × Pε is nonempty
and weakly closed.
Finally, let us discuss three extensions of our theorem. First of all, the proof is easily adapted
to non-symmetric potentials Φ. In this case one splits σ into two constants σ±, deﬁned as the
integral of Φ over (0, 1) and (−1, 0), and distinguishes proper interfaces and ghost interfaces
in diﬀerent phases by their constant energy contribution σ+ + σ−, 2σ+ or 2σ−. One may also
consider potentials like Φ(v) = (1− v)2 and drop the volume constraint for vε. Then there is only
one material phase, and the vε are mere auxiliary variables to allow curvature induced kinks.

Second, changing the power of ε in the last term of (1.4) to εk, k > 1, or even dropping the
term completely yields the Γ-limit (1.3) with ˆσ = 0, that is, without bending contribution of
kinks; the underlying topology changes to weak H 1 convergence of the curves.

Third, the arguments can be extended to handle non-closed curves with ﬁxed end points and
prescribed tangents in the approximate model. The additional issue in this situation is that kinks
may appear at the boundary in the sense that the tangent vector of the limit curve diﬀers from
the prescribed one. As for ghost interfaces this yields a contribution to the limit energy; see [10]
for the details.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section we present the proof of Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst show equi-coercivity of the energies
Eε, then establish the lower bound inequality and close with the upper bound. An important
ingredient in what follows is the fact that given q ∈ Cε and a directed line in the plane there is
u ∈ H 1(S1) such that u(t) is the angle between q(cid:48)(t) and this line; u is uniquely determined up
to adding multiples of 2π, and in addition we have κq(t) = u(cid:48)(t) for all t ∈ S1. On the other
hand, the curve is uniquely determined by ﬁxing one point together with its tangent there and
an angle function. For q ∈ C we can still ﬁnd an angle function u ∈ H 1(S1 \ Sq), but as jumps
can be arbitrarily large it is not unique anymore; of course we can assume that each jump is less
than 2π. If we are only interested in ﬁnding a local angle function near a kink, its jump can be

bounded by the enclosed angle of the limit tangents if the line is chosen appropriately. In such
a local setting |[q(cid:48)]| is simply given by |[u]|.

2.1 Equi-coercivity
Lemma 2.1. Let (qε, vε) ∈ Cε×Pε be a sequence with uniformly bounded energy Eε(qε, vε). Then
there are (q, v) ∈ C × P and a subsequence, not relabelled, such that qε → q in H 1(S1; R2) and
vε → v in L1(S1).
Furthermore, for this subsequence there are global angle functions uε ∈ H 1(S1) that converge
weakly in BV (S1) to an angle function u of q.

Proof. The argument for the sequence of phase ﬁelds is based on well-known observations by
Modica and Mortola,[14, 15] see in particular [4] for a proof in one dimension. The outcome is
a ﬁnite set of points ˜S ⊂ S1 and a function v ∈ P whose jump set Sv is contained in ˜S such
that a subsequence vε converges to v in measure and pointwise on S1 \ ˜S. Moreover, in the
one-dimensional setting (vε) is uniformly bounded in L∞(S1), hence the subsequence converges
in Lp(S1) for any p < ∞; we also have |vε| ≥ 1/2 for suﬃciently small ε in any interval compactly
contained in S1 \ ˜S.
Taking into account only the just selected subsequence, we address the curves. As translations
and rotations do not change the energy, we may assume that all curves pass at a ﬁxed s0 ∈ S1
through a common point with the same tangent vector τ0. From this and the fact that |q(cid:48)
ε| = 1
we get qε (cid:42) q in H 1(S1; R2) for a subsequence. To show that q ∈ H 2(S1 \ ˜S) let I be open
ε ≥ 1/4 in I for suﬃciently small ε, the sequence
and compactly contained in S1 \ ˜S. As v2
) = (|q(cid:48)(cid:48)
ε|2) is bounded in L1(I); thus a subsequence of (q(cid:48)(cid:48)
ε ) converges weakly in L2(I; R2)
(κ2
qε
to some q(cid:48)(cid:48)
I . But then qε converges weakly in H 2(I; R2) and from uniqueness of the weak limit
I is the weak derivative of q(cid:48) in I and that the whole sequence converges. This
we infer that q(cid:48)(cid:48)
convergence combined with |vε| → 1 and supε (cid:107)vε(cid:107)∞ < ∞ yields the estimate

deﬁned as q(cid:48)(cid:48)

I on I (cid:98) S1 \ ˜S, belongs to L2(S1; R2), and q ∈ H 2(S1 \ ˜S; R2) follows.

It remains to establish convergence of angle functions and to improve the convergence of the

curves. Applying H¨older’s inequality we get

Here the curvature integrals are bounded by E(qε, vε), and since Φ has a positive minimum on
[−1/2, 1/2], the quantity |{|vε| < 1/2}|/ε is controlled by the potential energy. Hence, with ¯u
satisfying (cos ¯u, sin ¯u) = τ0, the global angle functions

uε(s) = ¯u +(cid:90) s

are uniformly bounded in L∞(S1) and W 1,1(S1 \ {s0}). Therefore there is a subsequence such
that uε → u almost everywhere and weakly in BV (S1), that is uε → u in L1(S1) and κqεdt
ε = (cos uε, sin uε) → (cos u, sin u) = q(cid:48) in L2(S1; R2)
weakly to the measure Du. Consequently, q(cid:48)
and qε → q in H 1(S1; R2).

2.2 Lower bound inequality

Next we prove the lower bound inequality

Eε(qε, vε) ≥ E(q, v)

lim inf
ε→0

whenever (qε, vε) converges to (q, v) in H 1(S1; R2)× L1(S1). It suﬃces to examine the case when
(qε, vε) ∈ Cε × Pε and to consider a subsequence such that the lower limit is attained. Then our
compactness argument shows that (q, v) ∈ C × P and Sq ∪ Sv ⊂ ˜S, where ˜S ⊂ S1 is a ﬁnite set
of points. The same arguments as in (2.1) and the convergence C(vε) → C(v) in L2(S1) yield

(2.2)

As points in ˜S \ (Sq ∪ Sv) do not contribute to the limit energy, the task is to understand what
happens near kinks and interfaces. To this end it is convenient to introduce the set-dependent
energies

In what follows we establish estimates for Fε and F in the case of an interface
without a kink, extend the argument to interfaces with a kink, and afterwards deal with ghost
interfaces. The inequality for Eε and E then follows by combining these estimates with (2.2).

Interfaces without kink: s ∈ Sv \ Sq

2.2.1
Let I be an open interval in S1 such that ¯I ∩ ˜S = {s}. As the curve q has no kink in I, it does
not contribute to the limit energy F(q, v, I), so we estimate the curvature term of Fε(qε, vε, I)
simply by zero. The lower bound of the remaining part

(2.3)

is the well-known result for phase transitions by Modica and Mortola.[15, 14] In fact, there are
points aε, bε ∈ I, aε < s < bε or bε < s < aε such that vε(aε) → −1 and vε(bε) → 1 for a
subsequence ε → 0; restricting the integral to (aε, bε) or (bε, aε), inequality (2.3) follows from
Young’s inequality and a substitution of variables.

2.2.2

Interfaces with kink: s ∈ Sv ∩ Sq

Now let s be a point where the curve q has a kink and ﬁx local angle functions uε in a small
interval I around s such that ¯I contains no other point of ˜S. By our equi-coercivity result we
may assume that (uε) converges weakly in BV (I) to an angle function u of q; in particular, we
have

(cid:90)I

u(cid:48)

ε dt → [u](s) +(cid:90)I

κq dt.

Note that |[u](s)| ≥ |[q(cid:48)](s)| with strict inequality possible if the curves qε have loops near s that
vanish in the limit.
We split the neighbourhood I of s into two parts: one where vε is close to zero and the other
where its transition to ±1 takes place; we expect qε to approximate the kink in the former part.
Lemma 2.2. For I, u as above and any suﬃciently small δ > 0 let

be the set where |vε| is bounded by δ. Then

Mε,δ = {t ∈ S1 : |vε(t)| ≤ δ}

Proof. Let γ > 0 be arbitrary but ﬁxed, and let Uγ := [s − γ, s + γ]. As I \ Uγ is compactly
contained in S1\ ˜S we have |vε| ≥ 2δ in I \ Uγ for all suﬃciently small ε, and therefore I ∩ Mε,δ ⊂
Uγ. Writing wε = u(cid:48)

for all suﬃciently small ε. The ﬁrst term in (2.4) converges to zero as ε → 0 by weak convergence
of wεdt in I \ Uγ, and the second is less than a constant times
γ due to H¨older’s inequality and
the energy bound. As γ > 0 is arbitrary we obtain

Next we prove the key estimate for the lower bound inequality at kinks.

Lemma 2.3. Let I ⊂ S1 be an open interval such that ¯I contains exactly one point s ∈ Sv ∩ Sq
and no other points of ˜S. Then

Fε(qε, vε, I) ≥ ˆσ|[q(cid:48)](s)| + σ.

same with −δ and −1 on the other. Putting both estimates together and passing to the lower

and taking the supremum over all δ > 0 completes the proof.
2.2.3 Ghost interfaces: s ∈ Sq \ Sv
Finally, let s ∈ Sq \ Sv and I ⊂ S1 such that ¯I ∩ ˜S = {s} and the phase ﬁeld v is constant in ¯I,
say v ≡ 1. Then we argue as in Lemma 2.2 and 2.3 to ﬁnd

where the right-hand side is equal to ˆσ|[q(cid:48)](s)| + σ due to the symmetry of Φ. A similar argument
is true when v ≡ −1 near s, and this concludes the proof of the lower bound estimate for Fε and
therewith Eε.

2.3 Upper bound inequality

The ﬁnal subsection is devoted to the upper bound inequality. Given (q, v) with ﬁnite energy
E(q, v), we ﬁnd a recovery sequence (qε, vε) by changing (q, v) around (ghost) interfaces. For
each s ∈ S = Sq ∪ Sv we choose two nested intervals of size of order ε: In the inner the kink is
smoothed out by a linear interpolation of a local angle function, and in the outer the phase ﬁeld
transition to ±1 is made. But we have to ensure not to violate any constraint and not to tear
the curve apart when applying local changes to q and v.

2.3.1 The curve
Let s ∈ Sq and I ⊂ S1 with ¯I ∩ Sq = {s}. For simplicity of notation we identify points in I with
coordinates that map s to the origin and formulate the following arguments for curves and phase
ﬁelds given in an interval I around s = 0.
We ﬁx a line passing through the kink so that the tangents q(cid:48)(t) as t → 0 from above and
below meet it with angle ¯u and −¯u for some ¯u ∈ (0, π/2]; then the kink carries the “bending
energy” 2¯uˆσ. The local angle function u corresponding to the line is uniformly continuous on
either side of t = 0, hence by decreasing I we may assume that |u| < π in I and that u(t) is
negative for t < 0 and positive for t > 0.
of zero, the linear interpolation uε on an interval Iε = (−δε, δε) ⊂ I is given by

(cid:112)Φ(0) + 2¯u(cid:112)Φ(0)

But as noted before, just replacing q by qε on I is not admissible since the second endpoint
of q(I) is not reached by qε(I) and the whole curve would become discontinuous. Recalling
the relation of tangent and angle function, the condition on the endpoints can be expressed as
condition for uε by requiring

(cid:90)I
(cid:90)I

cos uε(t) dt =(cid:90)I
sin uε(t) dt =(cid:90)I

cos u(t) dt =: C0,

sin u(t) dt =: S0.

(2.6)

We amend the linear interpolation uε by adding a perturbation that on the one hand is suﬃciently
small not to contribute to the energy in the limit ε → 0, but on the other hand corrects the
defect in the constraints (2.6). We will ﬁnd two smooth functions f and g, which depend on u
in I, and two parameters αε and βε such that uε + αεf + βεg is admissible for suﬃciently small
ε; the argument is simply the Implicit Function Theorem applied to

P (ε, α, β) :=(cid:18) C0 −(cid:82)I cos (uε + αf + βg) dt
−S0 +(cid:82)I sin (uε + αf + βg) dt(cid:19) .

Lemma 2.4. Let q, u and uε be as above. There exist two functions f, g ∈ C∞
0 (I) such that
there are ε0 > 0 and functions ε (cid:55)→ αε, ε (cid:55)→ βε, continuously diﬀerentiable in [0, ε0) that satisfy
P (ε, αε, βε) = 0 for all ε ∈ [0, ε0).
Proof. Writing u as sum of a continuous function and a piecewise constant jump function and
uε correspondingly, it is easily seen that P is a C 1 function for suﬃciently small ε ≥ 0. To apply
the Implicit Function Theorem we have to show that ∂(α,β)P (0, 0, 0) is non-singular. To this end
we deﬁne two linear continuous functionals Ts, Tc : C∞

Tsϕ =(cid:90)I

and compute

ϕ(t) sin u(t) dt

ϕ(t) cos u(t) dt,

and

0 (I) → R,
Tcϕ =(cid:90)I
∂(α,β)P (0, 0, 0) =(cid:18)Tsf Tsg
Tcf Tcg(cid:19) .

Assume for the moment that neither Ts nor Tc is constantly zero. Suppose for contradiction
that ker Ts = ker Tc, which implies the existence of λ (cid:54)= 0 such that Ts = λTc; hence sin u =
λ cos u in I. This can only be true if u is piecewise constant, but then sin ¯u = λ cos ¯u and
− sin ¯u = λ cos ¯u contradict each other due to λ (cid:54)= 0.
Thus ker Ts (cid:54)= ker Tc, say ker Ts ∩ ker Tc (cid:40) ker Tc, and there is f ∈ ker Tc such that Tsf = 1.

After ﬁxing any g with Tcg = 1, the partial derivative is

∂(α,β)P (0, 0, 0) =(cid:18)1

0

∗

1(cid:19) ,

8

where ∗ is some real number. This matrix is non-singular, hence all prerequisites of the Implicit
Function Theorem are satisﬁed and the claim is proved.
It remains to consider the situation when one of the operators is zero. This is certainly not
0 (I) implies sin u = 0 and, due to |u| < π, u ≡ 0 in I. There
Ts, since Tsϕ = 0 for all ϕ ∈ C∞
is, however, a valid situation such that Tc = 0, and that is if and only if u(t) = π/2 sign t is
piecewise constant with a jump of height π. But then the second component of P (ε, 0, β) is zero
for all ε ≥ 0, all β ≥ 0 and any anti-symmetric function g. Fixing such g with Tsg (cid:54)= 0, we
can thus apply the Implicit Function Theorem to ˜P (ε, β) = P1(ε, 0, β) and get the desired result
with f = αε = 0.

So we have found an approximation uε + αεf + βεg on I that satisﬁes the constraints. Due
to α0 = β0 = 0, αε and βε converge to zero as ε → 0; then uε + αεf + βεg → u in L1(I) and ˆqε,
deﬁned by uε + αεf + βεg and the endpoints of q(I), converges to q in H 1(I; R2) and satisﬁes

(2.7)
As the number of kinks is ﬁnite, the construction can be made for each s ∈ Sq on an interval I s
ε .

2.3.2 Phase ﬁeld recovery and energy estimates

Now we construct a recovery sequence for the phase ﬁeld which is in line with qε from above. It
is well-known, see for example [1], that the optimal proﬁle for a transition of vε from −1 to +1
is obtained by minimising

Gε(v) =(cid:90)R

ε|v(cid:48)|2 + 1

ε Φ(v) dt

among functions v that satisfy v(0) = 0 and v(±∞) = ±1. Indeed, setting vε(t) = v(t/ε) we
observe

Gε(vε) = G1(v) ≥ 2(cid:90)R(cid:112)Φ(v)v(cid:48) dt = 2(cid:90) 1

−1(cid:112)Φ(v) dv = σ.

Equality holds if and only if v(cid:48) =(cid:112)Φ(v), which admits a local solution p with initial condition
p(0) = 0 because(cid:112)Φ(·) is continuous. Obviously the constants +1 and −1 are a global super-

and sub-solution of the problem, hence p can be extended to the whole real line. Since Φ(p) > 0
for p ∈ (−1, +1), p(t) converges to ±1 as t → ±∞. Thus p(t/ε) minimises Gε. Due to the
symmetry of Φ we can presume −p(−t) = p(t) and need to know the proﬁle only for t ≥ 0.

We assume again, that by identiﬁcation with appropriate coordinates the (ghost) interface is
located at s = 0 and that the phase ﬁeld is given on an interval I containing s. The building
block for the recovery sequence is

which connects pε = 0 and pε = 1 by a transition according to the optimal proﬁle and a linear
function, see Figure 2.1; the length of {pε = 0} is chosen consistently with the recovery of the

curve, that is δε = |[q(cid:48)](0)|/(2(cid:112)Φ(0)) · ε. In the next lemma we estimate the interface energy of

the nonzero part of pε.
Lemma 2.5. For any curve q ∈ H 2(I \ {0}; R2) we have

Fε(q, pε, I ∩ {t > δε}) ≤ σ

It is now evident how to construct the recovery sequence for an interface: we simply take

vε(t) =(cid:40)pε(t)

−pε(−t)

: 0 ≤ t,
: 0 > t

or the negative of it. Then vε converges to v in L1(I); it follows from Lemma 2.5 that these
approximations demonstrate the desired energy behaviour; in addition the volume constraint is
not aﬀected by substituting vε for v due to symmetry of pε.
In the case of a ghost interface we use the combination of pε(t) and pε(−t) or its negative.
Again, convergence and energy behaviour are as required, but the volume constraint is violated.
To get an admissible recovery sequence we add a small correction as we did with the angle

function. Let h : I → R be smooth, have compact support in I ∩ R>0 and satisfy (cid:82)I h dt = 1.

Then the volume constraint is satisﬁed by vε + γεh, if

Fε(q, pε + γεh, I ∩ {t > δε})) ≤ σ

Therefore v can be recovered around each interface, and the sequence for v on S1 is now built
by substituting vε + γεh locally for v. Combining the constructions for phase ﬁeld and curve we
have the following result.
Corollary 2.6. For (q, v) ∈ C × P and suﬃciently small ε there is (qε, vε) ∈ Cε × Pε such that
qε → q in H 1(S1; R2), vε → v in L1(S1) and

Eε(qε, vε) ≤ E(q, v).

ε→0

Proof. Denote by qε and vε the recovery sequences from this subsection. The convergence results
have already been established; for the inequality note that for each s ∈ S we have intervals I s
ε ⊂ I s
ε and the phase ﬁeld transition is made in I s \ I s
such that the kink is smoothed out in I s
ε ; so
combining the estimates (2.7) and (2.8) we get

Fε(qε, vε, I s) = lim sup

Together with (2.9) summed over all s ∈ S this yields the upper bound inequality for Fε(qε, vε, S1)
and F(q, v, S1). Finally, because vε is zero where κqε diﬀers from κq by more than the small
correction for the endpoint constraints, we have
