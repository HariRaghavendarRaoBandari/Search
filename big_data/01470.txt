The 10 GHz microwave conductivity, σ(T ) and high ﬁeld, 222 GHz electron spin resonance (HF-
ESR) of Li4C60 fulleride is measured in a wide temperature range. We suggest that the majority
of ESR active sites and at least some of the charge carriers for σ(T ) are electrons bound to a small
concentration of surplus or vacancy ions in the polymer phase. Both σ(T ) and the ESR line shape
depend on ionic motion. A change of the activation energy of σ(T ) at 125 K coincides with the onset
of the ionic DC conductivity. The ESR line shape is determined mainly by Li ionic motion within
octahedral voids below 150 K. At higher temperatures, ﬂuctuations due to ionic diﬀusion change
the environment of defects from axial to eﬀectively isotropic on the ESR time scale. σ(T ) data up
to 700 K through the depolymerization transition conﬁrm that the monomeric phase of Li4C60 is a
metal.

INTRODUCTION

C60 fullerene molecules form polymeric structures with
unusual phenomena, such as e.g. metallic conductivity
and antiferromagnetic order along chains1. Neutral C60
is polymerized by a light2 or pressure3 induced [2+2] cy-
cloaddition reaction. In these one- and two-dimensional
polymeric structures four-membered carbon rings inter-
connect the fullerene molecules. The polymerization of
Cn−
60 anions is spontaneous in alkali intercalated fulleride
salts. The structure of these polymers depends on the
fulleride charge, n.
[2 + 2] cycloaddition is favored for
low values of n, like in AC60 (A = K, Rb, Cs)4, while
single interfullerene bonds are more stable5 for n ≥ 3
as in Na4C60 and Na2AC60 (A = K, Rb)6. The size of
the counter-ion also plays a role; e.g.
in Na2CsC60 a
moderate pressure is needed to stabilize the polymeric
structure7.

Charge storage applications of Li intercalated carbona-
ceous compounds were proposed as early as 1976 (Ref.
8).
In this respect, the Li4C60 fulleride polymer is of
special interest. In the 2D polymeric layers of this com-
pound, fullerenes are connected by single bonds along one
direction and by [2 + 2] cycloaddition in the other9–11.
Li4C60 is a superionic conductor12 with a high ionic con-
ductivity (0.01 S/cm at 300 K). The ionic conductivity
of Li4C60 is intrinsic and it arises from the special struc-
ture; at low temperatures half of the Li ions have an un-
occupied neighbor site which is easily occupied at higher
temperatures12.

Recently Mg2C60, a fulleride electronically and struc-
turally similar to Li4C60, was also found to be an ionic
conductor13. In the case of alkali fullerides, ionic conduc-

tivity is limited to fullerenes with small alkali metal ions,
as the small trigonal aperture connecting interstitial sites
within the polymeric framework hinders ionic diﬀusion.
In fulleride crystals with larger alkali metal ions, diﬀu-
sion requires a reorganization of the fullerene molecular
positions. Larger alkali metal ions rearrange or diﬀuse
only at phase transitions or at high temperatures, e.g.
above 400 K in Na2C60 [Ref. 14]. The electronic proper-
ties under pressure and calorimetric measurements of Li,
Na and K doped fullerides were carried out in detail by
the group of Sundqvist et al.15–19. The ionic conductivity
depends also on other factors than the barrier between
sites; counter-intuitively, the DC conductivity of Li4C60
polymer increases under pressure.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin
resonance showed that Li4C60 polymer has a non-
magnetic, insulating ground state10 while the high tem-
perature monomer phase is metallic [Ref. 20]. The fre-
quency and temperature dependence of the electric con-
ductivity provides a direct information on the ionic and
electronic conductivities and on structural changes. In
the Li4C60 polymer, the low frequency conductivity up
to 1 MHz is dominated by the ionic contribution10, while
the microwave conductivity is electronic. Microwave fre-
quencies (typically 10 GHz) are well above the charac-
teristic frequency of Li+ ion movement and far below the
plasma edge in fulleride metals21 (typically 0.5 − 1 eV,
50− 100 THz); thus the microwave conductivity is domi-
nated by electronic contributions. Unpaired electrons at
Li vacancy and/or Li surplus sites are ESR active and are
aﬀected by Li ion diﬀusion. A complex behavior above
200 K of the electron spin resonance at 9 GHz was re-
ported in a previous study22. The high spectral resolu-

tion at 222.4 GHz of this study allows to follow the onset
of Li+ ion diﬀusion at the ESR active defect sites.

Here, we present microwave conductivity and high fre-
quency electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) measurements
on Li4C60 in the 40 − 700 K temperature range. We
study the electronic properties of the polymeric and the
monomeric phases with particular attention to the dy-
namics of electrons in the superionic phase and to the
depolymerization process. We ﬁnd that diﬀusion of Li+
ions above 125 K induces an activated electronic conduc-
tivity in polymeric Li4C60.
Ion diﬀusion also explains
changes in the HF-ESR spectrum in the same tempera-
ture range. We trace the depolymerization process up to
700 K and conﬁrm that the high temperature monomer
phase is a good conductor, in accordance with previously
reported results20.

prepared

samples were

described
previously9. A careful X-ray and NMR character-
ization conﬁrmed the polymeric structure and the
stoichiometry LixC60 with x = 4, similarly to the
samples investigated in Refs. 12 and 20. For infrared
(IR) measurements, the sample was pressed in an Ar
ﬁlled glove box into KBr pellets. Li and Na doped
species were measured in the glove box with a Bruker
Alpha spectrometer, K4C60 was measured in an air tight
sample holder in a Bruker IFS 66v spectrometer at room
temperature with a resolution of 2 cm−1.

Powder samples of Li4C60 were sealed in quartz tubes
under 200 mbar He for the microwave conductivity and
ESR measurements. Microwave conductivity was mea-
sured using the cavity perturbation technique which is
well suited for air sensitive powder samples and thus
allows the study of alkali fulleride compounds23. This
method is based on the measurement of changes in the
quality factor, Q, of a microwave cavity arising from mi-
crowave eddy currents in the sample24. The 10 GHz
TE011 copper cavity has an unloaded quality factor of
Q0 ≈ 10, 000. A nitrogen gas ﬂow quartz cryostat al-
lowed to vary the sample temperature between 130 K
and 700 K while keeping the cavity temperature at 290 K.
Measurements in the 40− 300 K temperature range were
performed in a similar cavity placed in a liquid He cryo-
stat. The powder samples were placed at the center of
the cavity where in highly conducting samples the elec-
tric ﬁeld is not excluded by depolarization eﬀects. The
grain size of the sample was smaller than the microwave
penetration depth and the conductivity is proportional
to 1/Q − 1/Q0 [Ref. 25] where Q and Q0 are the qual-
ity factors of the cavity with and without the sample,
respectively26. Only relative variations of the conductiv-
ity are measured as the proportionality factor between
microwave losses and conductivity depends on the un-
known grain size distribution.

High frequency electron spin resonance spectra were

2

recorded with a home-built spectrometer27 operating at
222.4 GHz (corresponding to 7.93 T for a g-factor of
g = 2). The maximum output power of the microwave
source is 46 mW. Microwave radiation is transmitted by
a quasi-optical bridge and is detected with an InSb detec-
tor operating at 4.2 K. The spectrometer has a sensitivity

of about 3× 1010 spins /(10−4 T√Hz). The resolution of

ESR lines determined by the homogeneity of the magnet
is 0.05 mT.

FIG. 1: Room-temperature infrared spectrum of Li4C60 com-
pared to that of Na4C60 and K4C60, shifted and scaled for
clarity. Li4C60 and Na4C60 have similar IR spectra with a
mode around 800 cm−1 signaling single bonds in the polymer,
whereas the IR spectrum of monomeric K4C60 is markedly
diﬀerent.

Fig. 1 shows the infrared (IR) spectrum of Li4C60 and
for comparison, the spectra of Na4C60 and K4C60, where
the charge state of the fullerene is also C4−
60 . The IR spec-
trum of Li4C60 resembles that of Na4C60, in agreement
with the polymeric nature of both compounds. Na4C60
is a two-dimensional polymer with single bonds28. Poly-
mer formation signiﬁcantly distorts the C60 ball29 and
the original icosahedral symmetry of C60 is lowered to
C2h in Li4C60 [Ref. 9] and Ci in Na4C60 [Ref. 28]. This
results in the large number of IR active modes in con-
trast to the four allowed IR modes of C60. On the other
hand, the larger size of the alkali ion hinders the poly-
mer formation in K4C60. Although there is a Jahn-Teller
distortion30 even in this case, the distortion of the C60
ball is smaller than in polymers and the IR active modes
emerging from the lower symmetry are weak.

The strong band at 800 cm−1 in Li4C60 and Na4C60
arises from a single bond between fullerenes31 and is not
an intramolecular mode. Thus the infrared spectra con-

ﬁrm that single bonds are present in the Li4C60 polymer
as determined by the structural characterization9.

Infrared spectroscopy can in general provide informa-
tion about the conductivity of materials.
In the case
of powders in KBr pellets, the eﬀects of light scattering
obscure the exact shape of the free-carrier (Drude) ab-
sorption, but the signs of metallic character are a strong
background absorption and the change of the vibrational
bands from Lorentzian to Fano shape32,33. We do not ob-
serve any of these eﬀects here, which conﬁrms the absence
of such additional spectral weight in the IR spectrum of
Li4C60 at room temperature. This invokes that the elec-
tronic conductivity is negligible in agreement with Ref.
12. Due to the large mass of the charge carrying ions in
fulleride compounds, the Drude peak corresponding to
the ionic conductivity is well below the usually accessi-
ble frequency of 100 cm−1.

FIG. 2: Temperature dependence of the 10 GHz microwave
conductivity of Li4C60 normalized at 295 K. Red triangles:
heating (heating rate 0.2 K/s), blue dotted squares: cooling.
Unpaired electron concentration increases above 300 K, de-
polymerization is signiﬁcant above 400 K.

Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the
10 GHz microwave conductivity, σ(T ), of Li4C60 normal-
ized to the room temperature value. Data above 260 K
are for increasing temperature only. Below 260 K, data
taken in heating and cooling are indistinguishable. The
conductivity was too small to measure the microwave loss
below 40 K. At low temperature, σ(T ) increases with
increasing T ; it has a maximum around 300 K and a
minimum at 410 K. Thermal cycles around the polymer-
ization temperature show that the data in Fig. 2 below
400 K corresponds to the polymeric phase. The subse-
quent rapid increase arises from the onset of depolymer-
ization and is discussed in Sec. III D.

ity in Li4C60 (ﬁlled squares, this work) and the DC (ionic)
conductivity (solid curve, Ref. 12). The conductivities are

conductivity is larger than the ionic, however, its absolute
value is not known. Straight lines are ﬁts to the data. Note
the marked upturn in both electronic and ionic conductivi-
ties at about 125 K, which is attributed to the onset of Li+
diﬀusion.

Fig. 3 compares the low temperature microwave con-
ductivity with the DC conductivity data of Ref. 12 us-
ing an Arrhenius presentation. An activated behavior
σ(T ) = σ0e−∆/T with diﬀerent activation energies, ∆,
above and below 125 K ﬁts well the microwave conductiv-
ity data. The corresponding parameters are summarized
in Table I. The activation energy of the DC ionic conduc-
tivity is much larger than for the microwave conductivity.
Although the absolute value of the microwave conductiv-
ity is not known, it is certainly much larger than the DC
conductivity at 125 K, the onset of ionic diﬀusion and
most likely remains larger up to 300 K.

The diﬀerent temperature dependence of the DC and
microwave conductivities suggest these have diﬀerent ori-
gins. In our view12, above the 125 K onset of Li+ ionic
diﬀusion to about ambient temperatures the DC conduc-
tivity arises mainly from the ionic conductivity, σion in-
volving all Li ions. (Sundqvist et al.18 raised, however
some doubts about this). On the other hand, we suggest
that the microwave conductivity is the electronic conduc-
tivity σel at 10 GHz associated with a small concentration

of charged defects.

There is ample evidence for Li ionic diﬀusion at am-
bient temperatures and below12,22. It was observed by
the motional narrowing of the 7Li NMR line and, as
explained in Sec. III C, the narrowing of the ESR line
above 125 K is also well understood by Li ionic diﬀusion.
The strong temperature and frequency dependence of the
DC conductivity supports the dominant role of the ionic
contribution34.

The microwave conductivity has an electronic origin;
the ionic conduction is negligible at 10 GHz. Except
for very low frequencies, the ionic conductivity decreases
strongly with frequency. An extrapolation of the low
frequency data at 246 K and below shows that σion at
1010 Hz is well below the sensitivity of the microwave
cavity conductivity measurement technique. The total
conductivity (i.e.
ionic plus electronic) as a function of
frequency has a temperature dependent minimum some-
where between 106 and 109 Hz. From DC to frequencies
of the order of 106 Hz the conductivity is dominated by
the ionic contribution while at higher frequencies the con-
ductivity is due to electrons bound to charged defects.

According to the IR experiment (Sec. III A), the ma-
terial is essentially an electronic insulator at ambient
temperatures; the electronic band gap is large and most
electrons do not contribute to the conductivity. We sug-
gest that the electronic conductivity is associated with a
small concentration of electrons trapped at defects of the
lattice. Li vacancy or Li surplus sites are obvious can-
didates; for these sites the microwave conductivity and
ESR originate from the same electrons. As explained
in Sec. III C, the unpaired defect electrons are conﬁned
to well deﬁned states at octahedral voids below 125 K.
The associated microwave electronic conductivity is due
to electron hopping between states in the vicinity of the
charged defects. Calorimetric measurements also support
this proposal. A contribution to the speciﬁc heat was at-
tributed to Li+ motion within octahedral voids from tem-
peratures as low as 2 K [Ref. 19]. The disorder induced
by Li ionic diﬀusion above 125 K creates new electronic
states and allows electronic diﬀusion of the small con-
centration of defect electrons to larger distances. This
explains the stronger increase of conductivity above the
onset of Li ionic diﬀusion at 125 K.

Finally, we note that one may associate the slowly
hopping localized electronic states giving rise to the mi-
crowave conductivity of the polymeric phase to small-
polarons35–38. Li4C60 is an ionic salt with an insulator
ground state. According to HF-ESR results (discussed in
Section III C), at low temperatures the excited states are
conﬁned to the vicinity of octahedral voids. These local-
ized excitations diﬀuse slowly as temperature is raised.
The small-polaron motion is a thermally activated pro-
cess, which agrees well with our ﬁndings shown in Fig. 3.
The concentration of mobile electrons is small and small-
polaron conduction in Li4C60 contributes signiﬁcantly to
the conductivity only at high frequencies, where the ionic
contribution is negligible. At microwave frequencies, the

4

electronic (polaronic) conduction determines the conduc-
tivity. The presence of polarons can also be inferred from
HREELS measurements indicating coupling of electrons
to low-energy (alkali metal or intermolecular) phonons
[Ref. 39].

FIG. 4: Schematics of the suggested ESR active defect. Large
blue circles are polymeric fulleride ions. Dark and light
molecules are in the front and back, respectively. Green (red)
circles are Li+ ions in octahedral (tetragonal) sites. In sto-
ichiometric Li4C60, octahedral voids are occupied by 2 Li+
ions and have 2 unoccupied sites. The unpaired electron is
bound to the void occupied by 3 Li+ ions marked by a dashed
line contour.

The ESR spectrum arises from defects of the poly-
meric matrix or from unpaired electrons in the poly-
meric structure bound to charges arising from a slight
oﬀ-stoichiometry of the Li concentration. The ESR ac-
tive defect concentration is one S = 1/2 spin per hundred
C60 molecules22. As explained below, at low tempera-
tures the large majority of the ESR active sites have the
same environment and we suggest that the ESR arises
mostly from oﬀ-stoichiometry. Fig. 4 is a schematic view
of a charged ESR active site bound to a surplus Li+ ion
in an octahedral void. The resonance frequency of the
ESR, characterized by the g-factor, is sensitive to small
variations in the electronic conﬁguration surrounding de-
fects. The anisotropic g-shift depends on the spin-orbit
interaction and the crystal ﬁeld in an environment with
lower than cubic symmetry and is very small in materials
composed of light atoms40. The previous ESR study22 at
35 GHz observed the deviation from cubic symmetry as a
splitting of the ESR signal. The present higher resolution
222 GHz ESR work follows the evolution of the environ-
ment of ESR active defects in detail. We ﬁnd that the
majority of defects evolve from an axial symmetry con-
ﬁguration at low temperatures to an eﬀectively isotropic
conﬁguration at ambient temperatures.

Temperature (K)

FIG. 5: Temperature evolution of the 222 GHz ESR spectrum
of Li4C60. The measured experimental (exp.) and the ﬁtted
(ﬁt) spectra are shown for each temperature. Below 290 K,
the spectra consist of an isotropic (black) and a uniaxially
anisotropic g-factor distribution (blue) component. Above
290 K, the anisotropic component is better described by a
rhombic g-factor anisotropy (red).

Fig. 5 displays the temperature evolution of the ESR
spectrum of as-prepared Li4C60. The spectrum is the su-
perposition of ‘anisotropic’ and ‘isotropic’ components.
The anisotropic component is a powder spectrum broad-
ened by the g-factor anisotropy in the magnetic ﬁeld.
The line shape is characteristic of a uniaxial g-factor
anisotropy (blue curve in Fig. 5)41,42. The width of
the anisotropic component decreases with temperature.
Above 280 K only a small intensity anisotropic line with a
diﬀerent line shape remains that possibly reﬂects a lower,
rhombic, symmetry. The decrease of the line width of the
anisotropic component is characteristic of a ﬂuctuating
environment in which the average g-factor anisotropy is

dependence of the g-factor anisotropy, ∆B/B0, of the ESR
line measured at the same frequency (222 GHz).

Fig. 6 displays the detailed variation of the relative
intensity and the line width for the anisotropic compo-
nent. The intensity of the isotropic component relative
to the total intensity of the spectrum, I(iso)/I(tot) is con-
stant at low temperatures and increases in a step-like
fashion between 210 and 240 K (Fig. 6a). The spec-
trum is dominated by the anisotropic component between
160 and 210 K and by the isotropic component above
260 K. The g-factor anisotropy of the anisotropic com-
ponent decreases gradually with increasing temperature
from 6.4 mT at 160 K to 2.6 mT at 290 K (Fig. 6b).
The defect concentration changes less than a factor of
2 below 280 K since the spin susceptibility, measured
by the ESR spectrum intensity, I(tot), depends little on
temperature22 between 150 K and 280 K. The long elec-

tronic spin-lattice relaxation time prevents reliable in-
tensity measurements at lower temperatures. The spin
susceptibility increases rapidly above 300 K, indicating
the formation of new ESR active defects.

We interpret the unusual temperature dependence of
the ESR spectrum as a consequence of the ﬂuctuation of
the g-factor tensor of unpaired localized electrons arising
from Li+ motion. At low temperatures, Li ions in tetra-
hedral sites are static. Li ions in octahedral voids are
hopping between a few possible sites and remain within
voids for long times. We assume that the anisotropic
component arises from unpaired electrons bound to oc-
tahedral voids with a third Li ion in addition to the two
Li ions of the majority sites. (Electron holes bound to
Li vacancies is another possibility). The charge of the
Li ion nearest to the unpaired electron is the most im-
portant factor for the deviation from cubic symmetry of
the crystal ﬁeld at the unbound electron. The orienta-
tions and principal values of the g-factor tensor of a given
ESR active site ﬂuctuates between a few well deﬁned val-
ues due to hopping of Li ions within the voids but within
the ESR time scale the anisotropy is not averaged to zero.
The relevant ESR time scale τESR = 5×10−9 s is given by
the low temperature width of the anisotropic line. Non-
identiﬁed sites, representing 20 percent of the localized
unpaired electron defects, give a narrow, isotropic line at
low temperatures.

At higher temperatures, the density of unpaired elec-
tronic states increases gradually with the increasing dis-
order and this decreases the eﬀective g-factor anisotropy.
At temperatures above 210 K, the ﬂuctuations of the g-
factor due to diﬀusion of Li ions between diﬀerent voids
in the polymeric structure becomes important and the
line shape changes in a qualitative way. Electrons bound
to (or in the vicinity of) the diﬀusing surplus ions ex-
perience a rapidly changing environment between many
more states than experienced at lower temperatures. Dif-
fusion involves all Li ions between voids according to Ref.
12. Each C60 molecule of the polymer is surrounded by
8 equidistant tetrahedral and 6 octahedral voids. Diﬀu-
sion in and out the large number of sites averages the
g-factor anisotropy and contributes the to a narrow, on-
the-average isotropic line intensity. The concentration of
unpaired electrons at isotropic sites increases rapidly be-
tween 210 and 260 K but the total defect concentration
does not change. Above 260 K Li ion hopping between
octahedral voids determines the ESR lineshape. At 340 K
only a very small intensity anisotropic line is observed
around the isotropic line.

The motion of Li ions was observed in a broad tempera-
ture range by the narrowing of the 7Li NMR spectrum22.
The temperature dependence of the NMR and the ESR
spectra are qualitatively similar. The NMR spectrum
at low temperatures has an ”anisotropic” broad compo-
nent due to the distribution of electric ﬁeld gradients
(EFG) at octahedral Li sites. Motion of the Li ions re-
duces the time-averaged EFG measured by the NMR line
width of the broad component. Like for the anisotropic

6

ESR, there are two temperature ranges. The NMR line
narrows moderately with temperature up to 190 K. At
higher temperatures the EFG decreases rapidly in a step-
like fashion and the narrow line at high temperature is
characteristic of an isotropic environment on the NMR
time scale.

Microwave conductivity, 7Li NMR, and ESR are sen-
sitive to both intra- and inter-void hopping but at diﬀer-
ent time scales. The DC ionic conductivity senses only
ion diﬀusion between voids. The onset of the increasing
isotropic ESR signal intensity (shown with an arrow in
Fig. 6) is thus associated with the onset of Li+ ion hop-
ping between voids around 210 K. This temperature is
slightly higher than the onset temperature of the rapid
narrowing of the anisotropic 7Li NMR line. The DC ionic
conductivity is more sensitive to the onset of hopping
between voids and is observed from much lower temper-
atures. As discussed earlier, the microwave electronic
conductivity is also inﬂuenced by the ionic motion.

Narrowing of the ESR spectra allows to estimate the
correlation time for Li diﬀusion between voids as it is
of the order of the correlation time, τm of the g-factor
ﬂuctuation41.

∆ωiso(T ) = ∆ω2(0) · τm,

where ∆ω(0) is the width of the static low temperature
anisotropic spectrum (in angular frequency units) and
ωiso(T ) is the width of the high temperature isotropic
line. Inserting ∆ω(0)/γ = 6.4 mT (γ/2π = 28.0 GHz/T
is the electron gyromagnetic ratio) and ∆ωiso(300 K) =
0.7 mT, we ﬁnd τm = 10−10 s.

D. Depolymerization and metallic conductivity in

the monomeric phase

X-ray diﬀraction at high temperatures shows a de-
polymerization of the low temperature monoclinic poly-
meric phase of Li4C60 into a cubic monomeric phase20.
The depolymerization is hysteretic; in the XRD study
a mixture of monoclinic and cubic phases appears be-
tween 470 and 600 K. ESR, NMR, and Raman spec-
troscopy data suggests that the cubic monomer phase is
metallic20,22. We conﬁrm in this work the metallic char-
acter of the high temperature phase by a direct measure-
ment of the electronic conductivity. The structural phase
transition between the electronic insulating low temper-
ature polymeric phase and the high temperature metallic
monomeric Li4C60 phases is followed in the 10 GHz mi-
crowave conductivity. Fig. 7 displays two examples of
the several temperature cycles performed. The heating
and cooling cycle between 300 and 710 K is between the
polymeric phase, well below the depolymerization tem-
perature, to above 670 K where the material is homoge-
neously monomeric. In the other cycle displayed, a large
part of the material remains polymeric up to 600 K.

The 10 GHz conductivity has a local maximum at
300 K and a minimum at about 400 K in all heat-

 

7

conductivity than in the polymeric phase at ambient tem-
perature. As expected for a metal, the spin susceptibility
of the monomer phase measured by ESR is high and ap-
proximately temperature independent22. (This measure-
ment was, however in cooling from 620 K of an incom-
pletely polymerized sample).

ing curves with various heating rates and history. The
anomaly diﬀers little between the heating and cooling
parts of the 300 and 600 K cycle where the transition to
the monomer phase is only partial. Thus the maximum
in the conductivity at 300 K is a feature of the polymeric
phase. We suggest that the anomalous decrease in the 10
GHz electronic conductivity between 300 K and 400 K is
due to the reversible breaking of some of the polymeric
bonds.

Above 400 K, the conductivity increases rapidly in the
heating cycle as metallic domains of the monomeric phase
are formed. The hysteresis of the 10 GHz conductivity
places the polymerization temperature at about 550 K in
agreement with the X-ray diﬀraction data20. For the cy-
cle shown in Fig. 7, hysteresis is very small above 670 K.
The conductivity is approximately temperature indepen-
dent above this temperature and an under-cooling eﬀect
is observed well below 670 K. The monomer phase is
metallic with more than an order of magnitude higher

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We studied the Li4C60 fulleride using microwave con-
ductivity and high ﬁeld electron spin resonance spec-
troscopy in a wide temperature range. Low tempera-
ture microwave conductivity changes near the temper-
ature where ionic conduction starts, which indicates a
connection between the electronic and ionic conductions.
HF-ESR measurements demonstrate that the Li+ ion
dynamics deeply inﬂuences the electronic conﬁguration
of the paramagnetic centers in the polymer superionic
phase. For T < 200 K, the ions are static and localize
the electrons which give rise to an ESR line with g-factor
anisotropy. When Li+ ions motion is activated, localized
electrons start to diﬀuse with diﬀerent velocities. The
hopping of localized electrons gives the most important
contribution to the conductivity of the polymer phase in
the microwave frequency range where the ionic conduc-
tivity is negligible. Near 300 K, the conductivity has a
maximum due to the onset of defect formation in the
polymeric phase. The complex dynamics of the electrons
in the polymer phase also results in an unusual temper-
ature dependence of the g-factor anisotropy. Microwave
conductivity measurements conﬁrm the metallic nature
of the high temperature monomeric phase Li4C60 com-
pound.
