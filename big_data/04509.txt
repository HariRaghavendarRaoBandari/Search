Traditionally, spectroscopy is performed by examining the position of absorption lines. However,
at frequencies near the transition frequency, additional information can be obtained from the phase
shift. In this work we consider the information about the transition frequency obtained from both
the absorption and the phase shift, as quantiﬁed by the Fisher information in an interferometric
measurement. We examine the use of multiple single-photon states, NOON states, and numerically
optimized states that are entangled and have multiple photons. We ﬁnd the optimized states that
improve over the standard quantum limit set by independent single photons for some atom number
densities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The goal of quantum metrology is to obtain the
most precise measurements possible with minimal re-
sources [1]. Many types of high-precision measurement
use a form of interferometry. In interferometers, the un-
known parameter is imprinted as the relative phase be-
tween a superposition of states. Measurement of the out-
put state, after quantum interference, gives information
about the unknown parameter.

One particular example is optical interferometry with
√
Mach-Zehnder interferometers. In this case, using N in-
N scaling for the uncer-
dependent photons gives 1/
tainty of phase measurements, which is known as the
standard quantum limit. However, using N entangled
photons gives 1/N scaling for the phase uncertainty,
which is often called the Heisenberg limit. This enhance-
ment in sensitivity is of much importance in probing del-
icate systems such as atoms [2] and biological samples
[3].

A well-known type of entangled states is NOON states
[4, 5]. NOON states saturate the Heisenberg limit. How-
ever, in the presence of absorption, NOON states perform
poorly [6, 7] and other states must be considered [8–11].
Even with such states, the advantage over the standard
quantum limit is reduced by loss. However, we can take
advantage of the sensitivity of nonclassical properties of
quantum states to absorption. The sensitivity of quan-
tum coherence can be used eﬃciently to estimate absorp-
tion [12], and also estimate physical quantities that the
absorption depends on.

In Ref. [13] a sub-shot-noise measurement of absorp-
tion is obtained using heralded single photons. In that
work, a non-interferometric setup was used, where all the
information is obtained from absorption, and the quan-
tum enhancement results from sub-Poissonian statistics
of single photons. According to the Kramers-Kronig re-
lation, absorption is accompanied by a phase shift [14].
However, the information from the phase is only acces-
sible if we take advantage of superposition and interfer-
ence.

One would think, since NOON states have coherence

which is highly sensitive to loss, they could be the best
candidates to sense loss or a parameter which causes loss
in the system. However, here we show that for the task of
spectroscopy, when there is an advantage to using entan-
gled states, it is possible to ﬁnd more general entangled
states that perform better than NOON states.

The system we are considering here is an ensemble of
atoms. We are interested in measuring a transition fre-
quency of the atoms.
If this ensemble is probed by a
beam of photons, the absorption of photons, and phase
shift imposed on the probe, both depend on the transi-
tion frequency of atoms. We consider a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with the atomic ensemble placed in one
of the arms of the interferometer. We optimize over the
state in the arms of the interferometer and ﬁnd the state
from which we obtain the maximum information about
the atomic transition frequency.

INTERFEROMETRIC SCHEME

Consider a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, as shown in
Fig. 1, with an ensemble of atoms placed in the upper
arm of the interferometer. Here, we consider an ensem-
ble of identical two-level atoms in the absence of Doppler
broadening and dipole dephasing. This simple model
gives a good qualitative description of the problem. As-
suming that all atoms interact equally with the input
quantum state and that there is no interaction between
atoms, using the dipole and rotating-wave approximation
the susceptibility of the ensemble is given by [15, 16]

∆ + iγs

χ(∆) = χ(cid:48)(∆) + iχ(cid:48)(cid:48)(∆) =

where ∆ = ω − ω0 is the detuning between ω0, the tran-
sition frequency of atoms, and ω, the frequency of input
photons, γs is the spontaneous decay rate of the excited
state, N is the number density of atoms, µ is the electric
dipole moment,  is the reduced Planck constant and ε0
is the vacuum permittivity. Details of the derivation of
this susceptibility based on interaction of an ensemble of
atoms with quantized light are given in Refs. [15, 16].

where L is the length of the ensemble, ω is the frequency

imaginary part of the susceptibility of the atomic ensem-
ble χ = χ(cid:48) + iχ(cid:48)(cid:48). The real part of susceptibility, χ(cid:48), de-
scribes dispersion and the imaginary part, χ(cid:48)(cid:48), describes
absorption by the ensemble.

From Eq. (3), the transmissivity of the ensemble, T ,
and the phase shift imposed on the state from the en-
semble, ϕ, can be written in terms of the imaginary and
real parts of the susceptibility

T = e−χ(cid:48)(cid:48)ωL/c,

ϕ = − χ(cid:48)ωL

The quantities T and ϕ are plotted in Fig. 4. This ﬁgure
is plotted for ω0 = 2π(508.33) THz, which is the D1
transition line of sodium [17], and L = 1 cm. As can be
seen from Fig. 4, for detunings close to zero, ϕ has the
highest slope. However, in this region, T is very small.

In the following section we ﬁnd the optimal states to
measure the transition frequency of the atoms i.e., ∆ in
this scheme.

FIG. 1. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an ensemble
of atoms placed in the upper arm. Da and Db are photon
number detectors in the output modes.

The imaginary and real parts of the susceptibility are
plotted in Fig. 2.
In this ﬁgure we have used data for
the D1 transition line of sodium from Ref. [17]; i.e. µ =
0.704 × 10−29 C · m and γs = 61.354 × 106 s−1. For
the number density of atoms we have used N = 2.5 ×
1016 m−3.

Knowing the susceptibility of the atomic medium, the
eﬀect of the atomic ensemble in the upper arm of the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be modeled by the
beam splitter model proposed in Refs. [18, 19]. Normally,
one beam splitter is used to model loss in each of the
arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer [9, 11, 20]. How-
ever, here we consider a line of n beam splitters, shown
in Fig. 3 where each beam splitter represents one of the
atoms in the ensemble. The kth beam splitter transforms

ter.

The eﬀect of the atomic ensemble is obtained by ap-
plying all the beam splitters, and taking the limit as the

N(cid:88)

We consider the general form of the state in the arms

of the interferometer to be

|ψ(cid:105) =

ψk |N − k, k(cid:105),

(5)

k=0

i.e., a pure state with the total photon number of N .
We use Fisher information as the measure to quantify
the metrological value of the states. According to the
Cram´er-Rao bound [21] the variance in estimating a pa-
rameter, ∆ in this case, using an unbiased estimate, is
lower bounded by the inverse of the Fisher information
F (∆)

3

Here, we are considering photon number detection in the
output modes, thus we are using classical rather than
quantum Fisher information. The Fisher information
represents the amount of information about ∆ contained
in the measurement results. It is given as

where Pn1,n2 (∆) is the probability of detecting n1 and

where ω = ∆ + ω0 is the frequency of the photons in the
input state. Because we are quantifying the metrological
value of the states via the Fisher information, we regard
the optimal states to be those which maximize the Fisher
information. We have found the optimal values of ψk
numerically using the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm.

In the PSO algorithm a swarm of particles search the
space of ψk coeﬃcients for those that maximize the Fisher
information. Each particle has a velocity #»v and position
#»x which are updated to #»v (cid:48) and #»x (cid:48) according to its best
previous position #»x (cid:96), and the best position of the entire
swarm #»x g as [22]

#»x (cid:48) = #»x + #»v (cid:48),

#»v (cid:48) = χ [ #»v + cgrg ( # »xg − #»x ) + c(cid:96)r(cid:96) ( #»x(cid:96) − #»x )] .

(9)

Here, rg and r(cid:96) are uniform random numbers in the in-
terval [0, 1], and χ, cg and c(cid:96) are constants. In our sim-
ulations, we used χ = 0.729, c(cid:96) = cg = 2.05 with 10
particles and 100 iterations.

We have found that the optimal state for a speciﬁc
type of atoms, only depends on the product of the num-
ber density of atoms and cell length, N L. This can be
explained in the following way. In Eqs. (4) and (8), we

have ωχ(cid:48)L and ωχ(cid:48)(cid:48)L which can be written as

ωχL = ωL(χ(cid:48) + χ(cid:48)(cid:48)) =

2N Lµ2ω0

ε0γs

(∆/γs + i) (1 + ∆/ω0)

1 + (∆/γs)2

.

(10)
For a given type of atom the multiplying factor at the
front can only be varied via N or L. The other param-
eters, µ, ω0 and γs can be varied by changing the type
of atom. These parameters aﬀect the variation of ωχ in
three ways:

1. They change the multiplicative factor at the front.
As that factor can also be changed by varying N
or L, that does not give any qualitatively diﬀerent
results than simply changing N or L.

2. The parameter γs appears in the ratio ∆/γs, and
therefore provides a scaling to the variation of ωχL
with ∆. It therefore does not qualitatively change
the results.

3. The parameter ω0 appears in the factor (1+∆/ω0).
This factor aﬀects the variation very little, because
we consider a parameter regime where ∆/ω0 (cid:28) 1.

In the following we keep L constant at 1 cm and
discuss the two cases: N > 1017 m−3 (large N ) and
N < 1017 m−3 (small N ).

A. Large N

For N > 1017 m−3, we have found that numerically
optimized states of the form given in Eq. (5) perform bet-
ter than NOON states and independent single photons.
In Fig. 5 we have compared the Fisher information of
the N -photon optimal state, N independent single pho-
ton states |1, 0(cid:105)⊗N , N copies of a single-photon NOON
√
state (|1, 0(cid:105) + |0, 1(cid:105)) /
2, and an N -photon NOON state
(|N, 0(cid:105) + |0, N(cid:105))/
2. This ﬁgure is plotted for N = 2
(upper row) and N = 10 (lower row). In this ﬁgure, we
have used ω0 = 2π(508.332) THz, which is the transition
frequency of the D1 line of sodium [17], and an atom
density of N = 2.5 × 1017 m−3.

√

Figure 5 shows that, even for N = 2, the enhancement
obtained by optimal states is signiﬁcant. For larger pho-
ton numbers, as is shown in the graphs for N = 10, there
is no further signiﬁcant improvement in the enhancement
of the optimal states. Moreover, the optimal states with
high photon numbers are not experimentally achievable
with the current technology. On the other hand, it may
be possible to generate the optimal states for N = 2 with
a scheme similar to the one proposed in Ref. [11].

Note that, close to resonance, for copies of single-
photon NOON states the maximum peak is higher than

for independent single photons and N -photon NOON
states. This is as would be expected, since single-photon
NOON states are the least sensitive NOON states to loss.
From Fig. 5(c), we see that ten-photon NOON states
perform worse than independent single photons close to
resonance. However, far from resonance, their Fisher in-
formation is even higher than the numerically obtained
optimal states. The reason why this is possible is that
the optimal states are only optimal in the sense of giv-
ing the largest maximum Fisher information, but it is
possible for other states to have larger Fisher informa-
tion for detunings where the optimal states do not give
their maximum Fisher information. On the other hand,
as can be seen in Fig. 5(a), two-photon NOON states
are less sensitive to loss (compared to ten-photon NOON
states), and close to resonance they perform better than
independent single photons.

The other thing to note from Fig. 5 is that to be able
to work in the region with maximum Fisher information
we need to have prior knowledge of the detuning. This
is because the peaks of maximum Fisher information are
quite narrow. In other words this scheme could be used to
measure hyperﬁne splitting of atomic levels, or measure
external eﬀects, such as magnetic ﬁeld, on the transition
frequency of atoms.

In Fig. 6 we have plotted the values of the coeﬃcients

5

FIG. 6. Coeﬃcients ψk of the optimal states, for four values

of the optimal states, ψk in the superposition (5), for a
range of photon numbers from N = 2 to N = 10. This
ﬁgure shows that the optimal states have higher ampli-
tudes for the terms with higher photon numbers in the
arm that contains the atomic ensemble. That is, when
there are more photons in the arm with the ensemble,
they are more likely to be lost, giving more information
about ∆.

B. Small N

For smaller values of N than considered in the pre-
vious subsection, the range of the phase shift is smaller
(see Fig. 7). In this case, the optimal state is N inde-
pendent single photons, |1, 0(cid:105)⊗N . Having all the photons
in the upper arm, only the loss is being probed, and no
information is being obtained from the phase shift. The
phase shift must be signiﬁcant so that we can take ad-
vantage of interferometric schemes in spectroscopy. Sur-
prisingly for N = 2.5 × 1016 m−3 the maximum of the
Fisher information for N independent single photons is
even higher than the maximum of the Fisher informa-
tion for the N -photon numerically optimized states with
a larger number density of atoms which were considered
in the previous subsection (see Fig. 8).
This could be understood from the variation of the
transmissivity T and phase shift ϕ with N , shown in
Fig. 7. For smaller values of N the range of the phase
shift is also smaller, which eliminates the advantage in
using entangled states. In this case, the Fisher informa-
tion is coming from the variation in the absorption. As
N is decreased further, the dip in the absorption is re-
duced which results in a smaller Fisher information. For
the higher densities, there is a larger phase shift, but it
is in a region where the absorption is very high.

In this work we found optimal multi-photon states for
measurement of the transition frequency of atoms. The
scheme proposed here is an interferometric scheme with
photon number detection in the output.
In order to
ﬁnd the best states for measurement of the transition
frequency, we numerically optimised for the states that
provide the largest Fisher information.

For the number density of atoms we considered ini-
tially, the imposed phase on the probe is large, and it
is advantageous to using information from both the ab-
sorption and the phase shift for measuring the transition
frequency.
In this case, the optimal state is an entan-
gled multi-photon state. This optimal state has a large
weighting on the state with all photons in the arm with
the atomic ensemble. On the other hand, for a smaller
number density of atoms, the phase shift imposed on the
probe is small and therefore the information from the
phase shift is not signiﬁcant enough to give any advan-

6

tage. In this case, it is advantageous to pass all the pho-
tons through the atom cell and obtain all the information
from absorption.
Surprisingly there is a value of the number density,
N = 2.5 × 1016 m−3, for which N independent single
photons have the highest Fisher information; even higher
than the Fisher information for the N -photon numeri-
cally optimised states with a larger number density of
atoms.
