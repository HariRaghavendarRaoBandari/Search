Relative Frobenius Formula

Avraham Aizenbud, Nir Avni and Yoav Krauz

March 22, 2016

Abstract

For a ﬁnite group G, Frobenius found a formula for the values of the function

tions of G. We generalize this formula to the relative case: for a subgroup H, we

PIrr G(dim π)−s for even integers s, where Irr G is the set of irreducible representa-
ﬁnd a formula for the values of the functionPIrr G(dim π)−s(dim πH )−t. We apply

our results to compute the E-polynomials of Fock–Goncharov spaces and to relate
the Gelfand property to the geometry of generalized Fock–Goncharov spaces.

1 Frobenius’ formula

Let S be a compact surface and let G be a ﬁnite group. A fundamental formula of
Frobenius relates the number of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of S to G
and the dimensions of the irreducible representations of G:

Theorem 1.1. Let S be a compact surface of genus k and let G be a ﬁnite group. Then,

(dim π)2−2k = |Hom(π1(S), G)| = |(cid:8)(x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk) ∈ G2k | [x1, y1] · · · [xk, yk] = 1(cid:9) |,

|G|2k−1 Xπ∈Irr G
For example, k = 0 givesPπ∈Irr G(dim π)2 = |G|, whereas from k = 1 we get

where Irr G is the set of (isomorphism classes of ) irreducible representations of G.

|G|

· |(cid:8)(x, y) ∈ G2 | xy = yx(cid:9) | =Xx∈G

|CG(x)|

=Xx∈G

|xG|

Theorem 1.1 also has versions for compact Lie groups and for pro-ﬁnite groups (see [Wit91,
AA]).

Theorem 1.1 is the case g = 1 of the following theorem:

Theorem 1.2. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let g ∈ G. Then,

|G|2k−1 Xπ∈Irr G

(dim π)1−2kχπ(g) = |(cid:8)(x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk) ∈ G2k | [x1, y1] · · · [xk, yk] = g(cid:9) |.

In this paper, we generalize Frobenius’ formula to the relative case, i.e., we replace
the representation theory of a group G by the harmonic analysis on some G-space X. We
apply our result for Gelfand pairs and the Hodge theory of Fock–Goncharov spaces.

2 Relative representation theory

Relative representation theory is motivated by the following example:

Example 2.1. Let H be a (ﬁnite) group, and consider H as a H × H-set via the action

(h1, h2) · h := h1hh−1
2 .

Consider the space C[H] of complex-valued functions on H as a representation of H × H.
We have

C[H] = Mπ∈Irr H

π ⊗ π∗.

2

This example shows that understanding the H × H-representation C[H] “is the same”
as understanding the representation theory of H. One can reformulate many concepts of
the representation theory of H in terms of the H × H-representation C[H]. Relative rep-
resentation theory (also known as abstract harmonic analysis) deals with those concepts
considered in a wider generality: a group G acting on a set X and the representation of
G on C[X].

Two important examples of representation theoretical concepts that have relative
counterparts are Schur’s Lemma, whose relative counterpart is the Gelfand property (see
Deﬁnition 4.1 below) and the notion of a character, whose relative counterpart is the
notion of spherical (or relative) character (see Deﬁnition B.1 below).

3 Relative version of Frobenius’ formula

We prove the following theorem in §6:

Theorem 3.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X, let g ∈ G, and let k ∈ Z≥0,
m ∈ Z≥1. Then:

dim(HomG(π, C[X]))m

dimπm+2k−1

χπ(g) =

#Gm+2k−1 ·

Xπ∈irrG

· #{p1, . . . pm ∈ X, h1, . . . hm, a1, . . . ak, b1, . . . bk ∈ G|hi ∈ Gpi,

h2,...hm,a1,...ak,b1,...bk ∈G

hi ·

mYi=1

kYi=1

#X g−1·h2···hm·[a1,b1]···[ak,bk]

[ai, bi] = g} =

#X hi,

mYi=2

where [a, b] := aba−1b−1 is the commutator of a and b.

In Appendix B we reformulate this theorem in terms of spherical characters.

4 A criterion for Gelfand pairs

Recall the deﬁnition of Gelfand pairs:

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group.

1. Assume that G acts on a ﬁnite set X. We say that X is multiplicity free if, for any

π ∈ Irr(G), we have dimHomG(π, C[X]) ≤ 1.

3

2. Let H < G. We say that (G, H) is a Gelfand pair if G/H is a multiplicity free

G-set.

Theorem 3.1 gives us the following criterion for Gelfand pairs:

Corollary 4.2. Let H ⊂ G be a pair of groups, and let X = G/H. Then the pair (G, H)
is a Gelfand pair if and only if

Xg,h∈G

#X [g,h] = Xg,h∈G

#X g · #X h · #X gh.

In fact, Theorem 3.1 implies also the following more general statement:

Corollary 4.3. Let H ⊂ G be a pair of groups and let X = G/H. For every k, m ∈ Z≥0
denote:

f (k, m) :=

h1,...hm,a1,...ak ,b1,...bk ∈G

X

#X h1···hm·[a1,b1]···[ak,bk]

#X hi.

mYi=1

Then, the following are equivalent:

• The pair (G, H) is a Gelfand pair.

• For every k, m ∈ Z≥0 and 0 < l ≤ k, we have f (k − l, m) = f (k, m + 2l).

• For some k, m ∈ Z≥0 and 0 < l ≤ k, we have f (k − l, m) = f (k, m + 2l).

5 Fock–Goncharov spaces

Theorem 3.1 can also be interpreted as a counting formula for (generalized) Fock–
Goncharov spaces, which we proceed to deﬁne. The setting for this section is as follows:
let S be a compact surface, let p1, . . . , pm ∈ S, m ≥ 1, be distinct points, and denote
S = S r {p1, . . . , pm}. Such S is called a surface of ﬁnite type. Choose a base point s ∈ S
and, for each i = 1, . . . , m, choose a representative τi ∈ π1(S, s) from the conjugacy class
corresponding to a circle around pi.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let G be a group acting on a set X. An X-framed representation
π1(S, s) → G is a tuple (ρ, x1, . . . , xm), where ρ : π1(S, s) → G is a homomorphism,
and xi ∈ X satisfy ρ(τi)xi = xi. The collection of all X-framed representations is denoted

by bXS,s,(τi),G,X.

4

If s′ and τ ′

Remark 5.3.

arises, we will omit s and τi from the notation.

If G is group scheme acting on a scheme X, then the functor sending a scheme T to

i are diﬀerent choices of a point and loops, then there is a bijection (depending
i ),G,X. When no confusion

on a choice of a path from s to s′) between bXS,s,(τi),G,X and bXS,s′,(τ ′
bXS,G(T ),X(T ) is representable by a scheme that we denote by bXS,G,X.
bXS,G,X, and we denote the quotient stack by XS,G,X. Similarly, if a group G acts on a set
X, we denote the quotient groupoid G\bXS,G,X by XS,G,X.

Deﬁnition 5.2. Let G be a group scheme acting on a scheme X. Then, G acts on

• If X is the ﬂag variety of a reductive group G, then the stack XS,G,X was deﬁned in
[FG06]. The authors of [FG06] deﬁned the notion of a framed G local system and
showed that XS,G,X is the moduli stack of framed G local systems on S (see [FG06,
§2]). The notion of a framed G local system extends to general G and X, and the
same proof shows that XS,G,X is the moduli space of framed (G, X)-local systems.

• If G is connected, then, by Lang’s Theorem, XS,G,X(Fp) ∼= XS,G(Fp),X(Fp).

In terms of the deﬁnitions above, Theorem 3.1 implies:

Theorem 5.4. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. Then

#bXS,G,X = (#G)1−χ(S) Xπ∈Irr G

dim(HomG(π, C[X]))#(SrS)

.

and

vol(XS,G,X) :=

Corollary 5.5. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. The following are
equivalent:

• X is a multiplicity free G-space.

• For any two non-compact surfaces of ﬁnite type S1, S2 such that χ(S1) = χ(S2), we

have vol(XS1,G,X) = vol(XS2,G,X).

• There are two non homeomorphic non-compact surfaces of ﬁnite type S1, S2 such

that χ(S1) = χ(S2) and vol(XS1,G,X) = vol(XS2,G,X).

5

Deﬁnition 5.6. We say that a set T of prime powers is dense if, for any ﬁnite Galois
extension E/Q and for any conjugacy class γ ⊂ Gal(E/Q), there exists pn ∈ T such that
p is unramiﬁed in E and γ = F rn
p .

Remark 5.7.

• The Chebotarev Density Theorem says that the set of all primes is dense.

• The Grothendieck trace formula implies that if X1, X2 are two schemes such that
X1(Fq) = X1(Fq) when q ranges over a dense set of prime powers, then X1(Fpn) =
X1(Fpn) for almost all primes p and for all natural numbers n.

The last corollary and [Kat08] implies:

Corollary 5.8. Let G be a group scheme over Z acting on a scheme X. The following
are equivalent:

• There is a dense set T of prime powers such that, for any q ∈ T , the set X(Fq) is

a multiplicity free G(Fq) space.

• For all but ﬁnitely many primes p and for all n, the set X(Fpn) is a multiplicity free

G(Fpn) space.

Moreover, if these conditions hold then, for any two non-compact surfaces S1, S2 such that

χ(S1) = χ(S2), the varieties bXS1,G,X and bXS2,G,X have the same E-polynomial1.

We will now apply Theorem 5.4 for the case of GLn acting on its ﬂag variety Fln.
Recall that, if λ = (λ1, . . . , λm) is a partition of n and λ∗ is the conjugate partition, then

hλ(i, j) = λi − j + λ∗

j − i + 1

is the length of the hook in the Young diagram corresponding to λ passing through the
box (i, j). We prove the following:

Theorem 5.9.

•

vol (XS,GLn,Fln(Fq)) = (n!)#SrS Xλ is a partition of n

qPk(k−1)λkχ(S) Yi,j : j≤λi

(qhλ(i,j) − 1)−χ(S)

hλ(i, j)#SrS

.

• The E polynomial of bXS,GLn,Fln is

(xy)Pk(k−1)λkχ(S) Yi,j : j≤λi

((xy)hλ(i,j) − 1)−χ(S)

hλ(i, j)#SrS

.

For the proof, we collect the following facts:

Proposition 5.10 ([Jam84]). For every partition λ of n, there exists a unique irreducible
representation Rλ of GLn(Fq) satisfying:

• Rλ appears in the permutation representation C[GLn(Fq)/Pλ(Fq)], where Pλ is the

standard parabolic corresponding to λ (see [Jam84, Chapter 11]).

• Rλ does not appear in the permutation representation C[GLn(Fq)/Pµ(Fq)], for µ < λ

(see [Jam84, Chapter 15]).

•

dimRλ = qPk(k−1)λk

(see [Jam84, Page 2]).

Corollary 5.11. For every partition λ of n, we have

• Tλ appears in the representation C[GLn(Fq)/Pλ(Fq)]B(Fq).

• Tλ does not appear in the representation C[GLn(Fq)/Pµ(Fq)]B(Fq), for µ < λ.

The following is classical:

Proposition 5.12. For every partition λ of n, there exists a unique irreducible represen-
tation πλ of Sn satisfying:

• πλ appears in the permutation representation C[Sn/Sλ], where S(λ1,...,λm) = Sλ1 ×

· · · × Sλm ⊂ Sn.

• πλ does not appear in the permutation representation C[Sn/Sµ], for µ < λ.

• dimπλ =

Proof of Theorem 5.9. Since dimHom(Rλ, C[Fln]) = dimTλ, it is enough to show that
dimTλ = dimπλ, for every λ. Recall that the Hecke algebra H Sn(t) corresponding to
the Coxeter group Sn is a (polynomial) one parameter family of algebras whose un-
derlying vector space is C[Sn]; we denote the product in H Sn(t) by ∗t. Recall that
the product ∗1 is the convolution on C[Sn] and that, if t is a prime power, then the
product ∗t corresponds to the convolution in C[B(Ft)\GLn(Ft)/B(Ft)] under the iden-
tiﬁcation C[B(Ft)\GLn(Ft)/B(Ft)] ∼= C[Sn] given by the Bruhat decomposition. Let
Mλ(t) ⊂ H Sn(t) be the subspace of Sλ-(right)-invariant elements of C[Sn]. For every
prime power t, Mλ(t) is an ideal, and, hence, the same is true for every t. Using the
interpolation of the natural inner product, we get that, for t ∈ R≥1, the algebra H Sn(t)
is semisimple, and, hence, there is an (analytic) trivialization of H Sn(t) over R≥1. Since
there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism types of representations of a given dimension, we
get that Mλ(t) can also be trivialized over R≥1. Corollary 5.11 and Proposition 5.12 imply
that, under the algebra isomorphism C[Sn] → C[B(Fq)\GLn(Fq)/B(Fq)], the modules Tλ
and πλ are isomorphic, and hence have the same dimension.

6 Proof of Theorem 3.1

The case k = 0, m = 1 of theorem 3.1 is easy:

Lemma 6.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. Then:

dim(HomG(π, C[X])) · χπ(g) = χC[X](g) = #X g.

(1)

Xπ∈Irr G

In order to deduce the general case we need a basic fact about convolution of characters.

Recall that for two functions f, g ∈ C[G], the convolution is deﬁned by

(f ∗ g) (h) =Xu∈G

f (u)g(u−1h).

Lemma 6.2. For any π, τ ∈ Irr G we have:

χπ ∗ χτ =

δπ,τ #G
dim(π)

χπ.

Now we ready to prove the main theorem.

Proof of theorem 3.1. Applying Lemma 6.2, the assertion follows by convolving (1) with
itself m times and with the formula in Theorem 1.2.

A An alternative proof of the Frobenus formula

Lemma 6.1 gives an alternative proof of the Frobenius formula (Theorem 1.1).

Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. For a representation π of G, deﬁne a

function on X × X by

χX

π (x, y) =

1

#G Xh : hx=y

χπ(h).

(2)

Lemma A.1. Consider the 2-sided action of G × G on G. Let π be a representation of
G. Then

χG

π⊗π∗(1, g) =

1

χπ(g).

#Gdimπ

Proof.

χG

π⊗π∗(1, g) =

1

#G Xh1,h2 : h1h−1

2 =g

χπ(h1)χπ(h−1

1 ) =

(χπ ∗ χπ)(g)

#G

=

1

#Gdimπ

χπ(g),

where the last equality is by Lemma 6.2

Proof of Theorem 1.1. the case k = 1 follows from the Lemma 6.1 and lemma A.1. The
general case follows by taking convolution power of the case k = 1 and using Lemma
6.2.

B The spherical character

The relative counterpart of the notion of the character of a representation is given in the
following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition B.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. Let π be a representation
of G.

9

1. Let φ : π → C[X] and ψ : π∗ → C[X] be morphisms of representations. Denote by

φt and ψt the dual maps. We deﬁne the spherical character χφ⊗ψ

π

∈ C[X × X] by

χφ⊗ψ

π

(x, y) = hφt(δx), ψt(δy)i,

where δx ∈ C[X] = C[X]∗ is the Kronecker delta function supported at x.

2. This deﬁnition extends (by linearity) to the case when φ ⊗ ψ is replaced by any

element of Hom(π, C[X]) ⊗ Hom(π∗, C[X]) = End(Hom(π, C[X])).

Lemma B.2.

Proof. For x ∈ X, let Lx

π : HomG(π, C[X]) → π∗ be the linear map deﬁned by

φ ∈ HomG(π, C[X]) 7→ (u ∈ π 7→ φ(u)(x)) .

Note that HomG(π, C[X]), HomG(π∗, C[X]) are naturally dual to each other by the pairing

hLx

πφ, Lx

π∗ψi

(φ ∈ HomG(π, C[X]); ψ ∈ HomG(π∗, C[X]))

hφ, ψi :=Xx∈X

therefore we shall identify HomG(π∗, C[X]) with HomG(π, C[X])∗.

Let φ ∈ HomG(π, C[X]), ψ ∈ HomG(π∗, C[X]). Then by deﬁnition,
