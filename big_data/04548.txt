Rising temperatures increased recruitment of brown tiger prawn

(Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay (Australia)

Marco Kienzle∗and David Sterling†

March 16, 2016

Abstract

Abiotic factors are fundamental drivers of the dynamics of wild marine ﬁsh populations.

Identifying

and quantifying their inﬂuence on species targeted by the ﬁshing industry is diﬃcult and very important

for managing ﬁsheries in a changing climate. Using multiple regression, we investigated the inﬂuence of

both temperature and rainfall on the variability of recruitment of a tropical species, the brown tiger prawn

(Penaeus esculentus), in Moreton Bay which is located near the southern limit of its distribution on the

east coast of Australia. A step-wise selection between 51 environmental variables identiﬁed that variations

in recruitment from 1990 to 2014 were best explained by a combination of temperature and spawning stock

biomass. Temperature explains 35% of recruitment variability and spawning stock biomass 33%. This

analysis suggests that increasing temperatures have increased recruitment of brown tiger prawn in Moreton

Bay.

1 Introduction

There is little doubt in the minds of ﬁshermen and scientists alike that environmental conditions shape

the productivity of marine ﬁsheries. Similarly to terrestrial ecosystems where temperature and rainfall are

key factors inﬂuencing the distribution and productivity of living organisms, marine ecosystems also change

in response to climate [Lehodey et al., 2006, Cheung et al., 2013]. This is exempliﬁed by the relationship

between anchovy production along the Peruvian/Chilean coast and the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation. Iden-

tifying such ecological dependencies is expected to improve our understanding of marine ecological processes,

ability to manage the exploitation of natural resources and further our capacity to adapt to climate change.

The productivity of marine waters oﬀ Australia is generally low [Haddon, 2007]. A number of physical

factors contribute to low concentrations of nutrients including low run-oﬀ from rivers carrying sediments

from a remarkably dry continent; coastal currents ﬂowing south from nutrient-poor northern tropical waters

and lack of permanent up-welling that would recirculate nutrients. Australia is as much a desert at sea as

it is on land [Kailola et al., 1993]. Coastal ﬁsheries concentrate around estuaries that provide habitats for a

diverse range of species [Blaber, 2000]. Their productivity depends on the quality and extent of habitats for

new recruits [Loneragan et al., 2013]; freshwater input driven by rainfall variations [Loneragan and Bunn,

1999] and optimal temperatures [Caputi et al., 2014].

Moreton Bay is a large estuary–fed bay in south-east Queensland, Australia (Fig. 1). This shallow body

of water has an average depth of 6.8 m and presents a gradient of salinity from brackish water in the west to

oceanic in the east inﬂuenced by freshwater discharge from rivers [Young, 1978]. Sea water temperature in

Moreton Bay varies throughout the year between 11.2 and 32.2 oC: it cools/warms faster in winter/summer

than the adjacent portion of ocean [Kienzle et al., 2016]. Moreton Bay’s semi-tropical maritime climate

is characterized by a wet season between October and May with an average 1500–1600 mm of rain per

year [Davie et al., 2011]. Several commercial ﬁsheries operate in the Moreton Bay [Parke, 2013] including a

ﬂeet of prawn trawlers catching at least ﬁve species of prawn (greasyback, Metapenaeus bennettae; eastern

2

king, Melicertus plebejus; brown tiger, Penaeus esculentus; endeavour, Metapenaeus endeavouri and banana

prawns, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis). This ﬁshery is the southernmost prawn ﬁshery catching brown tiger

prawn on the east coast of Australia. This species of prawn is tropical and is found in Moreton Bay close to

the southern limit of its geographical distribution (Fig. 1). Cool water is probably the major physical factor

limiting the production of P. esculentus in South Queensland where high production of prawns is limited to a

period of about 4 months per year when the mean temperature is above 25oC and growth rates exceed 1 mm

of carapace length per week [O’Brien, 1994b]. Adult tiger prawn burrow into the sediment during the day

and swim near the bottom at night for a duration controlled by water temperature [Hill, 1985], probably in

response to higher metabolic rates, speeding up digestion and inducing these poikilotherms to search for food

more frequently in warmer water. Catch rates are strongly correlated with water temperature [Kienzle et al.,

2014, Courtney et al., 2012]. The annual production of prawn ﬁsheries depends almost entirely on the annual

recruitment to the ﬁshery [Garc´ıa and Le Reste, 1981]. There are suﬃcient indications to show that their

annual production varies from year to year in relation to large scale climate factors [Garc´ıa and Le Reste,

1981]. Penn and Caputi [1986] suggested that heavy rainfall events from cyclones have the potential to both

increase and decrease recruit survival depending upon their timing. Sea surface temperatures during the

pre-recruitment period were found to have a positive eﬀect on the tiger prawn recruitment to the Shark Bay

prawn ﬁshery (Western Australia) but not in the Exmouth Gulf ﬁshery, 400 km north [Caputi et al., 2014].

In the Exmouth Gulf, warmer temperatures preceding the spawning season were found to have a detrimental

eﬀect on recruitment the year after.

As virtually all management advice regarding marine ﬁsheries exploitation are based on single-species

stock assessments [Skern-Mauritzen et al., 2015], these models are a logical place to integrate environmental

factors aﬀecting production and translate this knowledge into management decisions that account for ecolog-

ical processes. In practice, only a small number of stock assessments use environmental variables to predict

recruitment (e.g. Ulltang [1996], Myers [1998], Lehodey et al. [2008]) because it has proven diﬃcult to

3

identify reliable relationships between environmental variables and ﬁsheries production. Robins et al. [2005]

report that many researchers use correlations or regressions of varying complexity to establish empirical

relationships between environmental variables and ﬁsheries catch or catch-rates, yet ignore the fundamental

processes that govern ﬁsheries dynamics. As a consequence, these analyses often failed to withstand the

test of time because of confounding factors that were not accounted for [Myers, 1998, Deyle et al., 2013].

In recent years, the stock assessment of brown tiger prawn in Moreton Bay was improved substantially by

including ecological processes into the population dynamic model in the shape of a temperature-induced

physiological change in catchability [Kienzle et al., 2014] and variable recruitment-timing [Kienzle et al.,

2016]. Following these steps towards developing an ecological approach to brown tiger prawn stock assess-

ment in Moreton Bay, recruitment was the component of the population dynamic model left with the largest

amount of un-explained variability. Fitting the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) had found no

signiﬁcant eﬀect of spawning stock biomass (SSB) on recruitment variability despite large variations of SSB

over its recorded history [Kienzle et al., 2014] which should have provided, according to Walters and Martell

[2004], a very good ﬁshery dataset to study recruitment. Hence, this study investigated the eﬀect of climate

data on recruitment variability to understand which variable(s) and which weather station(s) provided data

that best explained the observed variation of brown tiger prawn recruitment in Moreton Bay between 1990

and 2014.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Climate data

Moreton Bay covers a 1500 km2 area between Queensland’s coast and Moreton Island. This stretch of ocean

is not covered by global oceanic databases. Therefore a proxy for water temperature was used given that a

linear relationship exists (R2 = 0.81) between daily water temperature at the bottom of Moreton Bay and

4

maximum daily air temperature recorded at Cape Moreton lighthouse (CM) by the Bureau Of Meteorol-

ogy [Australian Bureau of Meteorology]. The slope of this relationship was estimated to equal 0.89 ± 0.05

[Kienzle et al., 2016]. The Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM) has an array of weather stations scattered across

Australia that record atmospheric conditions. Of all the stations in the vicinity of Moreton Bay, only Cape

Moreton lighthouse had temperature records overlapping with the ﬁshery data analyzed (1990–2014). Rain-

fall data were available from several stations and those from Manly railway station (MR) and Karragarra

Island (KI) were used in this analysis (Fig. 1).

Total rainfall (mm) and daily maximum air temperature (oC) averaged over each month were aggregated

into variables covering longer periods of time (spring, summer, autumn, August–February or January–June)

corresponding to speciﬁc periods of the biological cycles of brown tiger prawn (reproductive, growth and

ﬁshing season [Courtney and Masel, 1997]). These environmental variables were associated with the brown

tiger prawn biological year, deﬁned as starting around 1st July and ﬁnishing 12 months later around 30th

June. Biological years were numbered according to the year that included the main ﬁshing season (Feb. –

May). A total of 51 variables representing rainfall and temperature measurements at three diﬀerent weather

stations were investigated (Tab. 1).

2.2 Recruitment and spawning stock biomass estimates

Recruitment to the ﬁshery (R) used in this analysis was estimated by ﬁtting a Deriso-Schnute delay-diﬀerence

model to catches of brown tiger prawn in Moreton Bay between 1990 and 2014 [Kienzle et al., 2014]. This

delay-diﬀerence model assumed constant growth, constant natural mortality, knife-edge gear selectivity and

targeted/non-targeted catchabilities. Seasonal variations of catchabilities induced by temperature through

an eco-physiological response of tiger prawn were accounted for in the stock assessment model using a sigmoid

function [Kienzle et al., 2016] to represent variations of the duration of emergence of brown tiger prawn at

5

diﬀerent temperatures [Hill, 1985]. The stock assessment model that best ﬁtted brown tiger prawn catches

in Moreton Bay between 1990 and 2014 was used to estimate the magnitude of yearly recruitment to the

ﬁshery, providing 25 estimates of recruitment (Fig. 2(a)).

Spawning stock biomasses (S) were calculated using the delay diﬀerence model’s estimates of biomass

by applying the weekly proportion of mature females obtained from scientiﬁc surveys [Courtney and Masel,

1997], assuming an even sex-ratio.

2.3 Stock–recruitment relationship

The Ricker stock-recruitment function

R = a S e−bS

(1)

was used to represent the relationship between spawning stock biomass (S) in a given year and recruitment

(R) in the following year. The steepness of the Ricker function at the origin is given by the derivative of the

function evaluated at S = 0

dR
dS

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)S=0

= a

(2)

The steepness (a) measures the productivity of the stock. When estimated for two diﬀerent environ-

mental conditions, its ratio ( a1
a2

) quantiﬁes the improvement/decline in productivity associated with the

diﬀerence in environmental conditions, all other things being equal.

Parameters a and b were estimated using linear regression on log-transformed data [Hilborn and Walters,

1992]

log(R) = log(a) − bS + log(S)

(3)

6

This model was ﬁtted with the linear regression function in R [R Core Team, 2015], using log(S) as an

oﬀset. Environmental variables were added successively to the simplest Ricker SRR model to assess the ﬁt

of all possible multiple regressions. The best multiple regression model was identiﬁed by step-wise selection,

both forward and backward, using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) implemented in the function stepAIC

available from the MASS package [Venables and Ripley, 2003].

3 Results

3.1 Characteristics of the climate data

Average maximum air temperatures in the region surrounding Moreton Bay have been trending upward

over the last 35 years (Fig. 3) peaking in 2006 and 2010 and slightly declining thereafter. Air temperature

increased, in average, 0.180 ± 0.014 oC per decade between 1980 and 2015. A greater increase in air temper-

ature was observed during the period overlapping with the tiger prawn stock assessment data (1990–2014),

with an average diﬀerence of 1oC in air temperature measured at Cape Moreton between 1985–1995 and

2005–2015.

Measurements of climate variables are correlated in time and space precluding their combinations into

multiple linear regressions prior to addressing collinearities. Temperature measurements at Cape More-

ton lighthouse were highly correlated (ρ ≥ 0.7) between successive months in winter, spring and summer

(Tab. 2). Moreover high correlations also existed between multiple month’s periods and the shorter periods

they included, meaning that high temperatures in January were indicative of high temperatures throughout

summer as well as throughout the pre-recruitment growth period (August to February, Tab. 2). Monthly

rainfall at Manly railway station and Karragarra Island was also strongly correlated, indicating that weather

systems inﬂuencing this region operate at a larger scale.

7

3.2 Variables explaining recruitment variability

A linear regression between recruitment (R) and spawning stock biomass (S) on the log-scale (Fig. 2(b))

was not signiﬁcant (model 1 in Tab. 3, F(1; 22 df)=4.139, p=0.054). The residuals of this ﬁt showed a trend

with time (Fig. 2(c)). Comparisons between more complicated models by step-wise selection concluded that

recruitment was better explained by a multiple linear regression including both the eﬀect of spawning stock

biomass (S) and average daily maximum air temperature measured in January at Cape Moreton lighthouse

(model 2 in Tab. 3). This model explained 68% of the total variability of recruitment: approx. 35% ex-

plained by variation in temperature and 33% by changes in spawning stock biomass. A model including

a term for interaction between temperature and spawning stock biomass (model 3) was best according to

AIC but the coeﬃcients for the interaction and eﬀect of spawning stock biomass (S) were not signiﬁcant

suggesting (−3.69e-06 ± 2.24e-06) that temperature might change the stock recruitment relationship but

there was insuﬃcient data (n=24) to quantify it precisely.

The linear eﬀect of temperature is biologically unrealistic because a dome-shaped relationship will likely

better represent characteristics of living organisms, such as growth or mortality, known to vary around a

maximum at an optimal temperature [Gillooly et al., 2001]. Therefore, a parabolic model of temperature

was ﬁtted to the data (model 4 in Tab. 3) to assess the feasibility of parametrizing a biologically more

meaningful model to describe the eﬀect of temperature on brown tiger prawn recruitment. This model has

a slightly larger AIC than model 3 (∆AIC=1.25). It suggested that the current temperature range observed

around Moreton Bay was limited to the ascending part of parabola (Fig. 4). Therefore past and present

conditions in Moreton Bay were sub-optimal for brown tiger prawn recruitment. Given the limited range of

temperature observed, the parametrization of the parabolic model is uncertain as shown by the large error

associated with its parameter elevated to the power of 2 (−6.95e-02 ± 5.57e-02). Inclusion of an interaction

term between spawning stock biomass and the polynomial of temperature measurement in January in Cape

Moreton (model 5) performed worst according to AIC (∆AIC=3.55).

8

The inclusion of a second environmental factor, rainfall in May at Karragarra, to explain variability in

brown tiger prawn recruitment (model 6) did not improve the model ﬁt (∆AIC=1.92, Tab. 3). It is concluded

that this variable does not help improve our understanding of the variation of brown tiger prawn recruitment.

According to the linear additive model including temperature and spawning stock biomass (model 2),

temperature did not modify the density-dependence eﬀect. It increased the recruitment to the ﬁshery (Fig. 5)

as measured by the steepness of the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship (a). An increase of temperature

by 1oC was estimated to increase the recruitment to the ﬁshery (a) by a factor 1.4 (exp(3.45e−01)). The

average maximum daily temperature measured in January between 1990 and 2014 ranged from 25.8 to 29.1

oC. According to model 2, such diﬀerence in temperature explained a variation in brown tiger prawn re-

cruitment by a factor of 3 (exp(3.45e−01 ∗ (29.1 − 25.8))) between the worst and the best environmental

conditions prevailing during this period of time. According to the parabolic model of temperature (model 4),

maximum recruitment would be reached at 29.9 oC (ﬁg. 4). This model suggests recruitment would increase

by a multiplicative factor of 1.5 per oC at 27oC down to a multiplicative factor of 1 at 29.9oC beyond which

it would decline. In other words, warming waters would increase prawn recruitment in Moreton Bay only

for a limited amount of time before declining.

4 Discussion

The results of the present work suggest that environmental factors have contributed to increase the recruit-

ment of brown tiger prawn in Moreton Bay between 1990 and 2014. The positive relationship between

temperature and recruitment is consistent with the biology of this tropical species living in an area close

to the southern limit of its distribution in the southern hemisphere [Courtney et al., 2012]. Cheung et al.

9

[2013] proposed to use the mean temperature of the catch to study the eﬀect of climate change on ﬁsheries

worldwide. Their results describe the tropicalisation of sub-tropical waters around the world as a result of

global warming which is supported by our results. In the present analysis, temperature variations explained

35% of recruitment variability making this variable the largest contributor to recruitment variation between

1990 and 2014. On the other hand, spawning stock biomass in a given year explained another 33% of

the variation of the number of recruits in the following year. The increasing trend in brown tiger prawn

recruitment over the last 20 years was previously regarded as the consequence of declining ﬁshing pressure

[Kienzle et al., 2014]. Since the magnitude of spawning stock biomass depends on ﬁshing mortality as well

as recruitment in the same year, itself inﬂuenced by temperature, the contribution of the reduction of ﬁshing

mortality to the recovery of the stock is likely to have been less than the contribution of environmental

factors. Nevertheless, this work suggests that both factors worked together to produce a higher stock size in

2014 than in 1990. The synchronicity of changes in environmental and ﬁshing factors around 2000 is inter-

esting and a source of confusion as to determine which factor aﬀected most the dynamic of this stock: this is

almost certainly the result of chance because there are no evidences suggesting a causal relationship between

temperature and ﬁshing eﬀort. Previous analyses failed to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between stock and

recruitment by regressing Ricker’s function to these data [Kienzle et al., 2014]. Including temperature in the

stock-recruitment relationship (model 2) permitted the detection of a signiﬁcant compensatory population

eﬀect (e.g., a dome-shaped stock-recruitment function) that was masked by temperature-driven variability,

as shown by Hare et al. [2010]. Both studies focused on species at the southern limit of their distribution.

In a re-analysis of environment and recruitment relationships, Myers [1998] concluded that there is one

generalization that stands out: correlations for populations at the limit of a species’ geographical range

have often remained statistically signiﬁcant when re-examined. Myers [1998]’s results suggest that the eﬀect

of temperature reported here is likely to hold into the future and therefore be a useful knowledge for the

management of the brown tiger prawn ﬁshery in Moreton Bay. The present results are also consistent with

an investigation of the eﬀect of climate change on ﬁsheries in Western Australia [Caputi et al., 2014] which

10

reported that ﬁshery-independent indices of recruitment for brown tiger prawn in the Shark Bay prawn

ﬁshery were positively correlated with sea surface temperature (ρ = 0.826).

Global warming is already occurring with signiﬁcant consequences for marine and freshwater resources

[Lough and Hobday, 2011].

It is predicted to continue into the foreseeable future [CSIRO-BOM, 2015],

therefore these results suggest that recruitment of brown tiger prawn in Moreton Bay should continue to

increase in line with an expected increase in temperature. As a result, ﬁshermen targeting this species in

Moreton Bay are likely to beneﬁt from a rising temperature induced by climate change, at least in the short

term. The optimal temperature estimated by the parabolic model used in this analysis (Tmax=29.9oC) is

close to maximal temperature recorded over the period 1990–2014, suggesting that recruitment might not

increase much further than already estimated. On the other hand, aquaculture experiments estimated the

optimal temperature for growth and survival of brown tiger prawn between 30 and 35oC [O’Brien, 1994a]

suggesting that there is more scope for an increase in brown tiger prawn recruitment in Moreton Bay. This

somewhat optimistic view about the consequences of climate change for the Moreton Bay prawn ﬁshery

has been obtained through the narrow lens of a single species assessment analysis. Our results should be

balanced by (a) the fact that beyond optimal temperature, further temperature increase will become detri-

mental to brown tiger prawns and hence its ﬁshery; (b) an evaluation of the impact of climate change on all

species caught in Moreton Bay to provide an holistic view of the short to medium terms costs and beneﬁts

of climate change to the ﬁshing industry in south east Queensland and (c) the productivity of brown tiger

prawn ﬁsheries further north may reduce as temperature increases beyond the optimum for this species,

redistributing brown tiger prawn production along the east coast of Australia.

The delay diﬀerence model used a constant somatic growth parametrization throughout the entire time

series. Therefore, a change of size at age resulting in a larger catch for a given recruitment would be incor-

rectly interpreted by the model as an increased estimate of recruitment. Even if the delay-diﬀerence model

11

could be modiﬁed to incorporate prawn sizes, no size data were collected to determine whether increased

temperature induced faster growth or higher larval survival leading to larger recruitment, or both. Our

research suggests that warmer temperature improved brown tiger prawn recruitment in Moreton Bay, but it

does not elucidate by which mechanisms this was actually achieved. Another interesting observation from

this research is that past increases in recruitment have been possible only because food to sustain larger

cohorts was available. There is no knowledge about how organisms preyed upon by brown tiger prawns are

responding to increasing temperatures and whether they will exist in suﬃciently large quantity to sustain

extrapolated further increase in recruitment at higher temperatures. Food and habitat shortage are recog-

nized as major limiting factors for the expansion of invertebrate populations in the wild [Loneragan et al.,

2013, Chittleborough, 1975].
