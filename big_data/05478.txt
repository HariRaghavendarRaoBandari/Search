(Dated: March 18, 2016)

We investigate the eﬀect of an electrical current on the attenuation length of a 900 nm wavelength
spin-wave in a permalloy/Pt bilayer using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy. The modiﬁcation of
the spin-wave relaxation rate is linear in current density, reaching up to 14% for a current density
of 2.3×1011 A/m2 in Pt. This change is attributed to the spin transfer torque induced by the spin
Hall eﬀect and corresponds to an eﬀective spin Hall angle of 0.13, which is among the highest values
reported so far. The spin Hall eﬀect thus appears as an eﬃcient way of amplifying/attenuating
propagating spin waves.

The use of spin-waves as a beyond-CMOS paradigm
for analog or digital signal processing is a key aim for the
ﬁeld of magnonics[1]. An important challenge involves
devising a transistor-like scheme, where the equivalent of
a gate voltage can control the propagation of spin-waves
(SW) between a source and a drain. This can be achieved
by using current-induced spin transfer torques (STT)[2],
which modify the eﬀective magnetic damping such that
magnetization precession is ampliﬁed or attenuated de-
pending on the current polarity. However, integrating
a vertical STT spin-valve on top of a magnonic waveg-
uide [3] remains diﬃcult. An alternative approach relies
on the spin Hall eﬀect (SHE), which allows for the genera-
tion of pure spin currents in a nonmagnetic material pos-
sessing a large spin-orbit coupling [4, 5]. In this approach,
an electrical current ﬂowing in the plane of a bilayer com-
prising a ferromagnet and a heavy metal induces a spin
current in the perpendicular-to-plane direction. The so-
called spin-Hall eﬀect spin transfer torque (SHE-STT)
arising from this spin current has been demonstrated in a
number of experiments in which modulation of magnetic
damping [6], control of magnetic ﬂuctuations [7], STT-
induced ferromagnetic resonance [8], magnetization re-
versal [9], and self-oscillations [10, 11] could be observed.
Recently, Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS) has been
used to demonstrate that the spin Hall eﬀect can lower
the magnetic losses acting on SWs propagating along
CoFeB/Pt [12] and CoFeB/Ta [13] strips. A spectacular
enhancement of the spin-wave attenuation length of up
to 60% could be observed [12]. However, in these exper-
iments, the phase-resolution ability of BLS was not used
and the SW wavelength was therefore not controlled. In
this article, we build upon these previous works resorting
to propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (PSWS), an all
electrical measurement scheme allowing one to monitor
accurately the propagation of spin-waves of well-deﬁned
wave-vector k (Ref. 14). We show that the relaxation
rate of a spin-wave with a wavelength of 900 nm can

be increased or decreased using SHE-STT. Within the
explored range, the modulation is linear in current and
its magnitude is comparable to the one reported for the
FMR mode (k = 0), using diﬀerent methods [5].

The PSWS technique is used here to investigate the
propagation of spin-waves in a permalloy (15 nm)/Pt
(10 nm) bilayer. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the stud-
ied devices consist of a permalloy(Py)/Pt strip of width
W = 10 µm on which a pair of spin-wave antennas is
patterned. Pads are attached to the strip for injecting a
dc current I and coplanar waveguides are connected to
the antennas for microwave measurements [Fig. 1(d)]. A
spin-wave is excited by passing a microwave current in
one antenna and is detected by measuring the magnetic
ﬂux induced on the second antenna. From the phase and
amplitude of the mutual-inductance ∆L21, where the in-
dices 1 and 2 refer to the emitting and receiving antennas,
respectively, one can extract the characteristics of the
SWs propagating between the two transducers. In paral-
lel, one also measures the self-inductances ∆Lii (i = 1, 2)
to evaluate the coupling between the antennas and the
spin-waves. The wave vector of the excited SW is deﬁned
by the Fourier transform of the microwave current distri-
bution, which displays a strong peak at k = 7.1 µm−1 for
the chosen antenna geometry [14]. A saturating magnetic
ﬁeld H is applied in the transverse in-plane direction,
that is, perpendicular to the direction of spin-wave prop-
agation. This so-called magnetostatic surface wave ge-
ometry has the advantage of providing strong spin-wave
signals. It is also the one for which the inﬂuence of SHE
is expected to be maximum since the spin accumulation
generated by the SHE is strictly collinear with the equi-
librium magnetization [Fig. 1(b,c)].

Spin-wave propagation is ﬁrst investigated at zero dc
current. Fig. 2(a) shows the mutual-inductance spec-
trum ∆L21 measured at µ0H = 37 mT for devices
with D = 1, 3, 5 µm, where D is the edge-to-edge dis-
tance between the antennas. One clearly sees that the

amplitude and the period of the waveforms decrease
rapidly with increasing D. As detailed below, these
two quantities, which are the essential outputs of the
PSWS measurements, can be analyzed to extract the
three essential parameters describing spin-wave propa-
gation. First, the waveform amplitude decays as A =

exp(−(D + Deﬀ)/Latt), where A = ∆L21/√L11L22 is the

maximum amplitude of the mutual-inductance normal-
ized to those of the two self-inductances, Latt is the at-
tenuation length deﬁned as the distance over which the
amplitude of the magnetization precession decreases by
a factor e, and Deﬀ is the eﬀective width of the antenna,
which accounts for the attenuation occurring below the
antenna itself [15]. Therefore, by plotting − ln(A) as a
function of D [diamonds in Fig. 2(b)], one obtains a lin-
ear dependence whose slope is 1/Latt. Second, the period
of the signal oscillations is the inverse of the SW prop-
agation time τ = (D + Deﬀ)/vg, where vg is the group
velocity. Then, plotting τ as a function of D [circles in
Fig. 2(b)] allows one to extract vg. Third, the amplitude
decay follows also A = exp(−Γτ ), where Γ is the mag-
netization relaxation rate. Thus, Γ can be obtained by
plotting − ln(A) as a function of τ [squares in Fig. 2(b)]
and extracting the corresponding slope. At zero cur-
rent, the above three parameters, which are related to
each other by Latt = vg/Γ, amount to Latt = 1.8 µm,
vg = 2.2 km/s and Γ = 1.2 ns−1. These values are in
excellent agreement with those obtained from the the-
oretical expressions vg,theo = ω2
MtPye−2ktPy /(4ω) and
Γtheo = α(ω0 + ωM/2) derived from the Damon-Eshbach

tPy is the permalloy thickness, α = 0.012 is the Gilbert
damping parameter of Py aﬀected by spin-pumping [5],

µ0Ms = 0.92 T is the eﬀective saturation magnetization
accounting for the presence of surface anisotropies.

Next, we examine similar PSWS measurements per-
formed with an applied dc current I in the range of
−50 mA to +50 mA. We apply the same procedure as
above, i.e., we look at the variation of the amplitude and
period of the transmitted signal as a function of D, for
diﬀerent values of I, in order to determine the current-
dependence of Γ, vg, and Latt. The results are presented
in Fig. 3. We observe a linear variation of Γ as a func-
tion of current [Fig. 3(a)]. This is clear evidence of the
SHE-induced spin transfer torque eﬀect: the spin current
generated by the SHE in the Pt layer is injected into the
Py layer and modiﬁes the magnetization precession via
the spin transfer torque, leading to an enhancement or
a reduction of the spin relaxation rate depending on the
current polarity [Fig. 1(b,c)].

The odd contribution [triangles in Fig. 4(b)] follows a lin-
ear dependence with a slope S = 1.5× 10−3 GHz/mA. It
is attributed to the Oersted ﬁeld HOe = IPt/(2W ) gen-
erated by the fraction of the current IPt that ﬂows in the
Pt layer. Using the value of S and the conversion fac-
tor obtained by diﬀerentiating the Damon-Eshbach dis-
persion relation with respect to the ﬁeld, one obtains a
ratio IPt/I = 0.45, which is consistent with the resis-
tivities of individual Pt and Py ﬁlms, 25 × 10−8 Ωm and
35×10−8 Ωm, respectively. This ratio is an important pa-
rameter that will be used later in the analysis of the mag-
nitude of the SHE-STT eﬀect. The even contribution [cir-
cles in Fig. 4(b)] is attributed to the Joule heating. From
the frequency decrease of 5% observed for |I| = 50 mA,
which corresponds to a saturation magnetization de-
crease of 7%, we estimate the temperature increase to be
about 150 K.[17] f even
res (I) may be ﬁtted to a polynomial
law fres(0)− aI 2− bI 4, where a = 1.18× 10−4 GHz.mA−2
and b = 1.9 × 10−8 GHz.mA−4. From this ﬁt and the
Damon-Eshbach expressions of vg and fres, we obtain
the change in group velocity expected from Joule heating
[dashed line in Fig. 4(b)], which accounts quantitatively
for the measured variation. [18] Importantly, by combin-
ing the change in group velocity induced by Joule heating
with the change in relaxation rate induced by the SHE-
STT, we can account for the measured variation of Latt
[dashed line in Fig. 4(c)]. This conﬁrms that our analy-
sis is self-consistent. After subtracting out the eﬀect of
Joule heating, the remaining variation of Latt is found to
be linear [open diamonds in Fig. 3(c)], as expected for a
purely SHE-STT-induced eﬀect.

Let us now analyze quantitatively the observed SHE-
STT eﬀect, for which the relevant quantity is the spin-
wave relaxation rate Γ. For our experimental geome-
try, the SHE-STT in the linearized Landau-Lifshitz equa-
tion of motion translates directly into a current-induced
change in magnetization relaxation rate,

dependence of vg and Latt. For the former, one observes
a symmetric decrease at high current values [Fig. 3(b)]
whereas for the latter, one observes a comparable nonlin-
ear decrease on top of a linear variation [Fig. 3(c)]. The
nonlinear deviations of both vg and Latt are attributed
to the decrease in the saturation magnetization due to
Joule heating. To analyze this eﬀect, we rely on the vari-
ation of the spin-wave resonance frequency fres with cur-
rent. Fig. 4(a) shows the mutual-inductances measured
at I = 0, +30 mA and −30 mA. With respect to the zero
current reference waveform, one observes a decrease in
frequency for both current polarities. We note however
that the decrease is signiﬁcantly larger for a negative cur-
rent than for a positive one. The overall variation of fres
is best seen by plotting the frequency of the maximum
of |∆L21| as a function of I [squares in Fig. 4(b)]. This
variation may be decomposed into odd and even contri-

where θSTT
SH is the eﬀective spin Hall angle of the Pt
ﬁlm including possible losses of angular momentum in
the interface region (due to, e.g., spin backﬂow[19] or
spin memory loss[20]), µB is the Bohr magneton, e is
the electron charge and JPt is the current density in the
Pt layer. By using the value IPt/I = 0.45, which is then
used to compute JPt, and ﬁtting the experimental data of
Fig. 3(a) to Eq. 1, one deduces an eﬀective spin Hall angle
θSTT
SH = 0.13. This value is among the highest reported
so far for Pt associated with Py (see, e.g., the review in
Ref. 4 and 5). By expressing it as a transverse spin con-
ductivity, we ﬁnd 5 × 105 S/m, which is comparable to
the intrinsic SHE value obtained from ab-initio calcula-
tions [21, 22]. While it is beyond the scope of this paper
to settle the highly controversial question of the determi-
nation of spin-Hall angles, we oﬀer three possible expla-
nations for the relatively high value we obtain: (i) The
spin transparency of our Py/Pt interface could be quite
high, as suggested by the relatively large value of the ef-
fective spin-mixing conductance 2.4 × 1019 m−2 deduced
from the increase of damping parameter in the present
Py/Pt bilayer as compared to a reference Py ﬁlm [19];
(ii) Part of the SHE might originate from within the Py
ﬁlm itself, which could explain why our value is com-
parable to those obtained for systems with comparable
Py thickness [23, 24]; (iii) The measurement geometry
chosen here is diﬀerent from the STT-FMR geometry
where the external ﬁeld is applied at an oblique angle
from the strip axis. From that perspective, the most
relevant points of comparison are measurements of SHE-
STT induced changes of damping in Py/Pt by cavity-
FMR [6] and micro-BLS [7], which are performed in the
same geometry as our PSWS experiments but at k = 0.
By analyzing these data using Eq. 1, we obtain eﬀective
spin Hall angles of 0.05-0.09. Our value for k = 7.1 µm−1
is comparable to, and even larger than, these estimates.
In the linear regime of excitation investigated here, i.e.,
far below the auto-oscillation threshold, the only eﬀect of
the SHE-STT is to change the magnetization relaxation
rate and, as expected from the form of the STT term
[Eq. 1], we ﬁnd that the process is as eﬃcient for a prop-
agating spin-wave with ﬁnite k as for the FMR mode or
for the thermally excited spin-wave manifold [25].

In conclusion, we have demonstrated experimentally
that the attenuation of propagating SWs with a well-
deﬁned wave vector can be eﬃciently controlled using
SHE-STT. We observed that the spin-wave relaxation
rate can be either enhanced or diminished depending on
the current polarity. The eﬃciency of the modulation is
found to be similar to what has been obtained in FMR
experiments, which probe the uniform magnetic mode.
Our ﬁndings establish experimental grounds for future
multi-frequency magnonic logic circuits, where a single
spin-wave channel operated at diﬀerent wave vectors is
used to perform parallel data processing [26]. Optimiz-
ing the material parameters of the bilayer might allow

4

for further control of the attenuation length to such an
extent that binary on/oﬀ operations in a spin-wave tran-
sistor could be envisaged.

[17] The magnetization decrease is obtained by diﬀerentiating
the Damon-Eshbach dispersion relation with respect to
Ms. The corresponding temperature increase may be es-
timated from the variation Ms/Ms(0) = 1 − 6.2 × 10−7T 2
deduced from SQUID measurements of permalloy ﬁlms
with similar thickness. A very similar temperature in-
crease is estimated by monitoring the resistance of the
strip, which varies from 31.4 Ω at small current to 39.5 Ω
at ±50 mA, and by using an average temperature coeﬃ-
cient of 0.2%/K for the bilayer resistance.

[18] Given its very small amplitude of (at most) 1 mT, the
Oersted ﬁeld is not expected to aﬀect vg and Latt signif-
icantly, contrary to Joule heating.
