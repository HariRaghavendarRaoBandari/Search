We discuss a method to reconstruct two-dimensional proton bunch densities using vertex distributions accu-
mulated during LHC beam-beam scans. The x-y correlations in the beam shapes are studied and an alterna-
tive luminosity calibration technique is introduced. We demonstrate the method on simulated beam-beam
scans and estimate the uncertainty on the luminosity calibration associated to the beam-shape reconstruction
to be below 1%.

Introduction

During the LHC Run-1 period, the LHC experiments introduced the Van-der-Meer (VdM) [1, 2] scan method
for luminosity scale calibration at the hadron collider [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

The VdM scan method is intended to measure the overlap integral OI of the colliding proton beams with

proton densities ρ1 and ρ2

OI =

ρ1(x, y)ρ2(x, y) dx dy,

(1)

after integration over the longitudinal coordinate and time.
If N1 and N2 are the number of protons in
the two colliding bunches respectively the instantaneous luminosity can be measured directly from machine
parameters according to

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

L = N1N2νrevOI .

R = σvis · L.

(2)

(3)

The measurable rate of a luminometer is given by the luminosity and the visible cross section for a speciﬁc
luminometer

The VdM scan method relies on the assumption that the bunch proton densities are factorizable in the
coordinates, x and y, of the transverse plane of the detector, i.e. ρi(x, y) = ρi(x)ρi(y).
In general, this
assumption does not hold and introduces one of the leading systematic uncertainties for luminosity calibration
measurements [4, 7].

The transverse beam-shape reconstruction therefore poses a challenging problem in the luminosity scale
calibration procedure of the LHC experiments. The LHCb collaboration exploits beam-gas interactions
to reconstruct the individual proton bunch densities [6, 8, 9]. Another approach exploits the evolution of
the mean and width of the luminosous region during the beam-beam scans [10]. In addition, a dedicated
tailoring of the LHC proton bunch injection chain was investigated to prevent the emergence of non-gaussian
beam-shapes [11].

In this paper a method to estimate the x-y correlations is developed and a new proposal for a comple-
mentary luminosity calibration is presented. The method generalizes the beam imaging technique proposed
in [12] and [13] to two dimensions.

In contrast to the standard VdM scan, beam-beam scans with one beam ﬁxed in the rest-frame of the
detector per x and y scan are utilized. The distributions of reconstructed proton-proton collision vertices in
the transverse plane accumulated during the scans constrain the two-dimensional proton densities and are
ﬁtted simultaneously to extract the analytical form for the proton densities of the two beams. As a result,

1

OI can be computed and used to estimate the instantaneous luminosity independent of x-y correlations in
the proton densities.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the impact of correlations on the standard VdM scan
method is studied. In Section 3 a new approach to reconstruct the beam-shapes is introduced and tested on
simulated beam-beam scans. In Section 4, a potential bias on the beam overlap estimation is studied and a
correction based on a speciﬁc regression is applied.

Impact of X-Y Correlation on the VdM Standard Analysis

In this section the impact of x-y correlations in the LHC bunch proton densities on the standard VdM scan
method is demonstrated. A set of simulated VdM scans based on random single gaussian beam-shapes is
generated. For each element in this set, the one-dimensional x and y scan curves are ﬁtted with a double-
gaussian model and the beam overlap integral OI is estimated based on the assumption on the factorizability
in x-y of the bunch proton densities

OI =

ρ1(x)ρ2(x) dx ×

ρ1(y)ρ2(y) dy.

To show the impact introduced by x-y correlations in the beam-shapes on the VdM scan method, the
result of three diﬀerent types of random beam-shape samples is shown. In Figure 1 the relative diﬀerence
of the true OI and reconstructed overlap region is shown. The the blue histogram shows the case of a
single gaussian beam-shape correlation coeﬃcients having the same sign, the red histogram with correlation
coeﬃcients having opposite signs, and the case where only one beam has a x-y correlation is shown in the
black histogram. The impact is largest for beam shapes which have correlation coeﬃcients with the same
sign and can be as large as about 9% . This diﬀerence leads to an overestimation of the beam overlap and
to an underestimation of the luminometer visible cross section.

Figure 1: An estimate of the impact of x-y correlations on the VdM scan method is shown. The blue
histogram shows the relative diﬀerence of the true OI with single gaussian beam shape correlation coeﬃcients
having the same sign. The red histogram with correlation coeﬃcients having opposite signs and the case
where only one beam has a x-y correlation is shown in the black histogram.

3 Two-dimensional Beam Imaging

As was shown in the last section, the VdM Scan method results in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent estimates for the
beam-beam overlap integral compared to the true one, if the bunch proton densities exhibit x-y correlations.
Therefore, sizeable systematic uncertainties were assigned by the CMS and ALICE Collaborations [4, 7] and
a bias of up to 3% was found by the LHCb Collaboration [6].

butions of the colliding bunches. A natural choice is to measure the vertex distributions in the transverse
plane, which is proportional to the proton densities of the two colliding bunches. The density of the number
of vertices at a given point (x, y) accumulated during a time interval ∆T and convolved with the vertex
reconstruction resolution V is given by

nvtx(x, y) = ρ1(x, y)ρ2(x, y)(cid:0)νrev∆T N1N2σpvtx(cid:1) ⊗ V,

(5)
where Ni (≈ 1011) is the number of protons in the corresponding bunch, νrev is the revolution frequency,
typically 11245 Hz, for a bunch in the LHC ring and vtx is the vertex reconstruction eﬃciency. For typical
VdM scan LHC run conditions, an inelastic proton-proton collision rate of 50 kHz can be assumed. With
a special (zero-bias) trigger set-up, detectors at colliders experiments are able to record data per bunch
crossing. For each scan point, data is typically collected within a time window of 25s. For the study in this
paper, we therefore assume about 106 reconstructed vertices per scan.
sponds to σb ≈ 60 µm, i.e. normalized transverse transmittance N ≈ 3 · 10−7m and β∗ ≈ 11m,

During the Run-1 VdM scan campaigns [6], beam optics were chosen such that the beam width corre-

σb =(cid:112)N β∗ ≈ 60µm.

(6)
The vertex reconstruction resolution V is dependent on the number of associated tracks and is about O(10)
µm [14], and we assume therefore σV ≈ 1

As described in the introduction an asymmetric scan setup is used as proposed in [12] and [13]. To derive
the ﬁt-model for the vertex distributions and without loss of generality the constants in Equation 5 are set
to 1

3 σb.

Considering a scan in x of one beam through the second in scan-steps ∆x, the following equation holds

In the ﬁrst step the distributivity property of convolutions is used and the approximation in the second
step is the replacement of the sum over discrete scan points with a continuous integral over the beam-beam
separation. After the integration, the x coordinate is integrated out and the bunch proton density of the
moving beam appears marginalized in x.

Considering four scans of this kind, ﬁrst scanning Beam 1 over Beam 2 in x and y and then vice versa,

four two-dimensional vertex distributions are accumulated:

x,2 (x, y) = ρ2(x, y)(Mρ1(y)) ⊗ V
nvtx
y,2 (x, y) = ρ2(x, y)(Mρ1(x)) ⊗ V
nvtx
x,1 (x, y) = ρ1(x, y)(Mρ2(y)) ⊗ V
nvtx
y,1 (x, y) = ρ1(x, y)(Mρ2(x)) ⊗ V.
nvtx

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

Each distribution constrains diﬀerent parts of the underlying beam proton densities. For example nvtx
x,2 (x, y)
only depends on Beam 2 in x and therefore fully constrains the width of Beam 2. Furthermore, this distribu-
tion has x-y correlations if and only if there are x-y correlations in the proton density of Beam 2. Together
with nvtx

y,2 (x, y) the proton density of Beam 2 is therefore fully constrained.

3

Assuming analytic models for ρ1(x, y) and ρ2(x, y) as well as the spacial vertex reconstruction resolution
V , the four distributions can be ﬁtted and the full two-dimensional proton densities of the two colliding
bunches of Beam 1 and Beam 2 estimated.

For arbitrary beam shape models the convolution with the vertex reconstruction resolution is diﬃcult
and only possible by utilizing numerical convolution methods which in turn result in high performance
ineﬃciencies time-wise. In past VdM scan campaigns however the bunch proton densities have been found
to be suﬃciently described by sums of gaussians [9] and the vertex reconstruction can equally well be
approximated by a sum of gaussian resolution models. The application of deconvolution and unfolding
methods in combination with the beam imaging should be investigated further.
Ten thousand beam imaging scans with 19 steps within the range of ±4.5σb are simulated with double-

gaussian beam shapes for each beam bi of the form

bi(x, y) = wigN (x, y) + (1 − wi)gW (x, y).

(15)

Each beam is a sum of a ”narrow” gaussian component gN and a ”wide” gaussian component gW , where
each is of the following form:

The ﬁt model from Equation 11 is then used and ﬁtted simultaneously to the four two-dimensional vertex
distributions. We use package ROOFIT [15] to perform the ﬁts. The beam shape input parameters are varied
within the following ranges

w1,2 ∈ [0, 1]
σN,x,y ∈ [1.6, 2.0]

ρN,W ∈ [−0.4, 0.4],
σW,x,y ∈ [2.0, 2.6] .

(17)

(18)

Figure 4 shows a comparison of the true beam shape parameters and the best-ﬁt paramters extracted

from the simultaneous ﬁt of the 4 vertex distributions using the ﬁt-model derived in Equation 11.

The beam overlap is then estimated from the ﬁt and compared to the true overlap calculated from the
beam shape input parameters, as shown in Figure 5 (blue dashed histogram). A relative shift of approximately
1% is observed. This diﬀerence can be viewed as a systematic bias of the method and is corrected for with
the procedure developed in the next section.

An example for a ﬁt result is shown in Table 1. For this particular example the true beam overlaps and

the ones estimated with the VdM scan method are

I = 0.0202 ± 0.0001,

While the beam imaging method measures a beam overlap consistent with the true beam overlap, a
relative diﬀerence of about 2% is observed when the VdM scan method is applied to measure the beam
overlap.

4 Bias Study and Regression

A dedicated method to correct for the on average 1% shift in the reconstructed beam overlap is developed
in this section. The method utilizes the regression functionalities based on neural networks of the TMVA
package [16]. A regression for the beam overlap is trained using the ﬁtted beam shape parameters as input
variables targeting the true beam overlap integral computed from the input beam shape parameters

) is the set of beam overlap

The sample of ten thousand simulated beam imaging scans is split into two random sub sets of samples
with ﬁve thousand scans each. One sample is used to train the regression and the other one is used to
evaluate the performace of the regression to prevent training bias.

The result is shown in Figure 5, red histogram. Compared to the uncorrected beam overlap, blue dashed

histogram, the regression method improves the resolution to 0.6% and successfully removes the bias.

5 Conclusions

We discussed a method to reconstruct two-dimensional proton bunch densities using vertex distributions
accumulated during LHC beam-beam scans. The x-y correlations in the beam shapes are studied and
an alternative luminosity calibration technique is introduced. Correlations in x-y can lead to a signifcant
overestimation of the instantaneous luminosity during the VdM scan and therefore bias the luminometer
visible cross section estimate towards low values. As discussed in Section 2, this eﬀect can be as large as 9%.
With the beam imaging method introduced here, we measure x-y correlations directly and hence the beam
overlap integral for arbitrary beam shapes. In Section 3, we derive a ﬁt model for two-dimensional vertex
distributions in the transverse plane of a detector accumulated during beam imaging scans, where one beam
is kept ﬁxed and the other one is moved in x and y. We evaluate the method on a sample of simulated beam
imaging scans with double gaussian beam shapes. After applying a dedicated correction based on a neural
network regression technique the beam overlap integral is reconstructed with a precision of better than 1%
assuming typical scan parameters.
