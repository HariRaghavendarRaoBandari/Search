Abstract

The subject of matrix ﬁeld theory involves matrix models, noncommutative geometry,
fuzzy physics and noncommutative ﬁeld theory and their interplay. In these lectures, a lot
of emphasis is placed on the matrix formulation of noncommutative and fuzzy spaces, and
on the non-perturbative treatment of the corresponding ﬁeld theories. In particular, the
phase structure of noncommutative φ4 theory is treated in great detail, and an introduction
to noncommutative gauge theory is given.

Disclaimer

These lectures grew partly from my own personal notes on the subject, and
partly from lectures given, intermittently, to my doctoral students during the
past few years. The list of topics treated in these notes reﬂects only the past
and present interests of the author, and we do not claim that these lectures
represents the actual state of the art of the subject. Furthermore, we do not
claim that the list of references included with these notes is comprehensive or
exhaustive in any shape or form. I would like only to take this opportunity to
apologize for any omissions. Several small parts of these lectures have already
appeared in various preprints found on the arXiv. I have felt no need to reword
my own expressions if I thought they conveyed the physics properly.

Introductory Remarks

1.1 Noncommutativity, Fuzziness and Matrices

It has been argued, by combining the principles of quantum mechanics and general
relativity, that the manifold structure of spacetime will necessarily break down at the
Planck scale , and that, at this scale, spacetime becomes quantized, expressed by the
commutation relations [65, 66]

[xµ, xν] = iλ2

pQµν.

(1.1)

This can be seen as follows. Measuring for example the coordinate x of an event with an
accuracy a will cause, by the Heisenberg principle, an uncertainty in momentum of the
order of 1/a. An energy of the order of 1/a is transmitted to the system and concentrated
at some time around x . This in turn will generate a gravitational ﬁeld by Einstein’s
equations for the metric. The smaller the uncertainty a the larger the gravitational ﬁeld
which can then trape any possible signal from the event. At this scale localization looses
thus its operational meaning, the manifold picture breakes down, and one expects space-
time uncertainty relations which in turn strongly suggest that spacetime has a quantum
structure expressed by the above commutation relations (1.1). The geometry of spacetime
at the very small is therefore noncommutative.

On the other hand, noncommutative geometry [124], see also [68–72] and [125], al-
lows for the description of the geometry of arbitrary spaces in terms of their underlying
C∗−algebras. Von Neumann called this “pointless geometry” meaning that there are no
underlying points. The so-called Von-Neumann algebras can be viewed as marking the
birth of noncommutative geometry.

Noncommutative geometry was also proposed, in fact earlier than renormalization, as
a possible way to eliminate ultraviolet divergences in quantum ﬁeld theories [63, 64]. For
example, quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on the noncommutative space (1.1) was shown to
be UV ﬁnite in [67]. This phenomena of regularization by quantization ocuurs also in
quantum mechanics.

Noncommutative ﬁeld theory is by deﬁnition a ﬁeld theory based on a noncommutative
spacetime [106, 194]. The most studied examples in the literature are the Moyal-Weyl

spaces Rd
antisymmetric constant tensors, i.e.

θ which correspond in (1.1) to the case Qµν = θµν where θµν are rank 2 (or 1)

[xµ, xν] = iθµν.

(1.2)

This clearly breakes Lorentz symmetry. The corresponding quantum ﬁeld theories are
not UV ﬁnite [83], and furthermore they are plagued with the so-called UV-IR mixing
phenomena [84]. This means in particular that the physics at very large distances is
altered by the noncommutativity which is supposed to be relevant only at very short
distances.

Another class of noncommutative spaces which will be important to us in these notes
are fuzzy spaces [52, 139]. Fuzzy spaces, and their ﬁeld theories and fuzzy physics, are
discussed for example in [53–57, 138]. Fuzzy spaces are ﬁnite dimensional approximations
to the algebra of functions on continuous manifolds which preserve the isometries and
(super)symmetries of the underlying manifolds. Thus, by construction the corresponding
ﬁeld theories contain a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. The basic and original mo-
tivation behind fuzzy spaces is non-perturbative regularization of quantum ﬁeld theory
similar to the familiar technique of lattice regularization [58,171]. Another very important
motivation lies in the fact that string theory suggests that spacetime may be fuzzy and
noncommutative at its fundamental level [59, 60]. A seminal example of fuzzy spaces is
N [200,201], which is deﬁned by three N × N matrices
the fuzzy two-dimensional sphere S2
i = 1, and the

xi, i = 1, 2, 3, playing the role of coordinates operators, satisfying (cid:80)

(1.3)

The fuzzy sphere, and its Cartesian products, and the Moyal-Weyl spaces are the main
noncommutative spaces discussed in these lectures.

Original work on the connection between random matrix theory and physics dates
back to Wigner, Dyson and then t’Hooft. More recently, random matrix theory was
investigated, in fact quite extensively, with connection to discrete 2−dimensional gravity
and dynamical triangulation of random surfaces. See for example [22] and references
therein.
In recent years, it has also become quite clear that the correct description of
noncommutative ﬁeld theory must be given in terms of matrix degrees of freedom.

Fuzzy spaces and their ﬁeld theories are, by construction, given in terms of ﬁnite di-
mensional matrix models, whereas noncommutative Moyal-Weyl spaces must be properly
thought of as inﬁnite dimensional matrix algebras, not as continuum manifolds, and as
such, they should be regularized by ﬁnite dimensional matrices. For example, they can
be regularized using fuzzy spaces, or simply by just truncating the Hilbert space of the
creation and annihilation operators.

However, these regularization are diﬀerent from the usual, more natural one, adopted
for Moyal-Weyl spaces, which is based on the Eguchi-Kawai model [36], and the noncom-
mutative torus [23, 24, 115]. The so-called twisted Eguchi-Kawai model was employed as
a non-perturbative regularization of noncommutative gauge theory on the Moyal-Weyl

MFT, Badis Ydri

space in [25–27]. Another regulator providing a ﬁnite dimensional matrix model, but with
boundary, is given by the fuzzy disc [180–183].

There are two types of matrix ﬁeld theories which are potentially of great interest.
First, matrix Yang-Mills theories, with and without supersymmetries, which are relevant
to noncommutative and fuzzy gauge theories, emergent geometry, emergent gravity and
emergent time and cosmology. Second, matrix scalar ﬁeld theories which are relevant to
noncommutative, fuzzy and multitrace φ4 models and their phase structure and renormal-
izability properties. The main theme, of these lectures, will be the detailed discussion of
the phase structure of noncommutative φ4, and noncommutative gauge theory, on Moyal-
Weyl spaces and fuzzy projective spaces. We hope to return to the other topics mentioned
above in a subsequent publication.

1.2 Noncommutativity in Quantum Mechanics

Spacetime noncommutativity is inspired by quantum mechanics. When a classical
phase space is quantized we replace the canonical positions and momenta xi, pj with
Hermitian operators ˆxi, ˆpj such that

[xi, pj] = iδij.

(1.4)

The quantum phase space is seen to be fuzzy, i.e. points are replaced by Planck cells due
to the basic Heisenberg uncertainty principle
∆x∆p≥ 1
2

(1.5)
The commutative limit is the quasiclassical limit −→0. Thus, phase space acquires a cell-
like structure with minimum volume given roughly by . In this section we will rederive
this result in an algebraic form in which the noncommutativity is established at the level
of the underlying algebra of functions.

It is a textbook result that the classical atom can be characterized by a set of positive
real numbers νi called the fundamental frequencies. The atom if viewed as a classical
system will radiate via its dipole moment interaction until it collapses. The intensity of
this radiation is given by

In ∝ | < ν, n > |4

< ν, n > =

niνi, ni∈Z.

(cid:88)

i

(1.6)

It is clear that all possible emitted frequencies < ν, n > form a group Γ under the addition
operation of real numbers

Indeed, given two frequencies < ν, n >=(cid:80)

Γ = {< n, ν >; ni∈Z}.

that < ν, n + n

i(ni + n

(cid:48)
i)νi is also in Γ.

The algebra of classical observables of this atom can be obtained as the convolution
algebra of the the abelian group Γ. To see how this works exactly one ﬁrst recalls that

MFT, Badis Ydri

10

any function on the phase space X of this atom can be expanded as (an almost) periodic
series

f (q, p; t) =

f (q, p; n)e2πi<n,ν>t; n ≡ (n1, ..., nk).

(1.8)

The Fourier coeﬃcients f (q, p; n) are labelled by the elements n∈Γ. The convolution
product is deﬁned by

(cid:88)

n

(cid:88)

f ∗ g(q, p; t; n) =

f (q, p; t; n1)g(q, p; t; n2)

f (q, p; t; n) = f (q, p; n) exp(2πi < n, ν > t).

n1+n2=n

(1.9)

(1.10)

(cid:88)

This leads to the ordinary commutative pointwise multiplication of the corresponding
functions f (q, p; t) and g(q, p; t), namely

f g(q, p; t) ≡ f (q, p; t)g(q, p; t) =

f1 ∗ f2(q, p; t; n).

(1.11)

n

The key property leading to this result is the fact that Γ is an abelian group.

If we take experimental facts into account then we know that the atom must obey the
Ritz-Rydberg combination principle which says that a) rays in the spectrum are labeled
with two indices and b) frequencies of these rays obey the law of composition, viz

We write this as

νij = νik + νkj.

(i, j) = (i, k) ◦ (k, j).

(1.12)

(1.13)

The emitted frequencies νij are therefore not parametrized by the group Γ but rather
by the groupoid ∆ of all pairs (i, j).
It is a groupoid since not all frequencies can be
composed to give another allowed frequency. Every element (i, j) has an inverse (j, i) and
◦ is associative.

The quantum algebra of observables is then the convolution algebra of the groupoid
∆ and it turns out to be a noncommutative (matrix) algebra as one can see by rewriting
(1.10) in the form

F1F2(i,j) =

F1(i,k)F2(k,j).

(1.14)

One can easily check that F1F2(cid:54)=F2F1 so F (cid:48)s fail to commute.

To implement the element of the quantum algebra as matrices one should replace

f (q, p; t; n) = f (q, p; n)e2πi<n,ν>t by

F (Q, P ; t)(i,j) = F (Q, P )(i,j)e2πiνij t.

(1.15)

From here the Heisenberg’s equation of motion, phase space canonical commutation rela-
tions, and Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations follow in the usual way.

1.3 Matrix Yang-Mills Theories

The ﬁrst indication that noncommutative gauge theory is related to Yang-Mills matrix
models goes back to the early days of noncommutative ﬁeld theories. Indeed, noncom-
mutative gauge theories attracted a lot of interest originally because of their appearance
in string theory [61, 107, 108]. For example, it was discovered that the dynamics of open
strings, moving in a ﬂat space, in the presence of a non-vanishing Neveu-Schwarz B-ﬁeld,
and with Dp-branes, is equivalent, to leading order in the string tension, to a gauge theory
on a Moyal-Weyl space Rd

Extension of this result to curved spaces is also possible, at least in one particular instance,
namely the case of open strings moving in a curved space with S3 metric. The resulting
eﬀective gauge theory lives on a noncommutative fuzzy sphere S2

N [59, 60, 62].

This same phenomena happens already in quantum mechanics. Consider the following

The is precisely what happens in string theory. We get noncommutative gauge theories
on Moyal-Weyl planes or fuzzy spheres depending on whether the strings are moving, in
a Neveu-Schwarz B-ﬁeld, in a ﬂat or curved (with S3 metric) backgrounds respectively.
The corresponding limit is α

(cid:48)−→0.

At almost around the same time, it was established that reduced Yang-Mills theories
play a central role in the nonperturbative deﬁnitions of M-theory and superstrings. The
BFSS conjecture [43] relates discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of M-theory, to the
theory of N coincident D0 branes which at low energy, small velocities and/or string

MFT, Badis Ydri

coupling, is the reduction to 0 + 1 dimension of the 10 dimensional U (N ) supersymmet-
ric Yang-Mills gauge theory [44]. The BFSS model is therefore a Yang-Mills quantum
mechanics which is supposed to be the UV completion of 11 dimensional supergravity.

As it turns out, the BFSS action is nothing else but the regularization of the super-

membrane action in the light cone gauge [45].

The BMN model [46] is a generalization of the BFSS model to curved backgrounds. It is
obtained by adding to the BFSS action a one-parameter mass deformation corresponding
to the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background of 11 dimensional supergravity.
See for example [47–49]. We also note, in passing, that all maximally supersymmetric
pp-wave geometries can arise as Penrose limits of AdSp × Sq spaces [50].

The IKKT model [51] is, on the other hand, a Yang-Mills matrix model obtained by
dimensionally reducing 10 dimensional U (N ) supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory to
0 + 0 dimensions. The IKKT model is postulated to provide a constructive deﬁnition of
type II B superstring theory, and for this reason, it is also called type IIB matrix model.
The dynamical variables are d matrices of size N with action

S = − N
4

T r[Xµ, Xν]2 + T r ¯ψΓµ[Xµ, ψ].

(1.21)

The supersymmetric analogue of the IKKT model also exists in dimensions d = 3, 4 and
6 while the partition functions converge only in dimensions d = 4, 6 and 10 [40–42]. In
d = 3, 4 the determinant of the Dirac operator is positive deﬁnite [41,230], and thus there
is no sign problem. Mass deformations such as the Myers term [12] are essential in order to
reproduce non-trivial geometrical backgrounds such as the fuzzy sphere in these Yang-Mills
matrix models including the IKKT matrix model. Supersymmetric mass deformations in
Yang-Mills matrix models and Yang-Mills quantum mechanics models are considered for
example in [228, 229].

The IKKT Yang-Mills matrix models can be thought of as continuum Eguchi-Kawai
reduced models as opposed to the usual lattice Eguchi-Kawai reduced model formulated
originally in [36].

We point out here the similarity between the conjecture that, the lattice Eguchi-Kawai
reduced model allows us to recover the full gauge theory in the large N theory, and the
conjecture that, the IKKT matrix model allows us to recover type II B superstring.

The relation between the BFSS Yang-Mills quantum mechanics and the IKKT Yang-
Mills matrix model is discussed at length in the seminal paper [107], where it is also shown
that toroidal compactiﬁcation of the D-instanton action, the bosonic part of the IKKT
action, yields, in a very natural way, a noncommutative Yang-Mills theory on a dual
noncommutative torus [39]. From the other hand, we can easily check that the ground
state of the D-instanton action is given by commuting matrices, which can be diagonalized
simultaneously, with the eigenvalues giving the coordinates of the D-branes. Thus at tree-
level an ordinary spacetime emerges from the bosonic truncation of the IKKT action,
while higher order quantum corrections will deﬁne a noncommutative spacetime.

The central motivation behind these proposals of using Yang-Mills matrix models
and Yang-Mills quantum mechanics as non-perturbative deﬁnitions of M-theory and su-
perstring theory lies in D-brane physics [225–227]. At low energy the theory on the

MFT, Badis Ydri

13

(p + 1)−dimensional world-volume of N coincident Dp-branes is the reduction to p + 1
dimensions of 10 dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills [44]. Thus we get a (p + 1)
dimensional vector ﬁeld together with 9 − p normal scalar ﬁelds which play the role of
position coordinates of the coincident N Dp-branes. The case p = 0 corresponds to
D0-branes. The coordinates become noncommuting matrices.

The main reasons behind the interest in studying these matrix models are emergent
geometry transitions and emergent gravity present in these models. Furthermore, the
supersymmetric versions of these matrix models provide a natural non-perturbative reg-
ularization of supersymmetry which is very interesting in its own right. Also, since these
matrix models are related to large N Yang-Mills theory, they are of paramount impor-
tance to the string/gauge duality, which would allow us to study non-perturbative aspects
of gravity from the gauge side of the duality. See for example [231–234].

In summary, Yang-Mills matrix models provide a non-perturbative framework for
emergent spacetime geometry [35], and noncommutative gauge theories [37,38]. Since non-
commutativity is the only extension which preserves maximal supersymmetry, Yang-Mills
matrix models will also provide a non-perturbative regularization of supersymmetry [34].
Indeed, Yang-Mills matrix models can be used as a non-perturbative regularization of the
AdS/CFT correspondence [30]. This allows, for example, for the holographic description
of a quantum black holes, and the calculation of the corresponding Hawking radiation [29].
This very exciting result can be found in [31]. Yang-Mills matrix models also allow for
the emergence of 3 + 1dimensional expanding universe [32] from string theory, as well as
yielding emergent gravity [33].

Thus the connections between noncommutative gauge theories, emergent geometry,
emergent physics and matrix models, from one side, and string theory, the AdS/CFT
correspondence and M-theory, from the other side, run deep.

1.4 Noncommutative Scalar Field Theory

A noncommutative ﬁeld theory is a non-local ﬁeld theory in which we replace the or-
dinary local point-wise multiplication of ﬁelds with the non-local Moyal-Weyl star prod-
uct [73, 74]. This product is intimately related to coherent states [78–80], Berezin quan-
tization [81] and deformation quantization [82]. It is also very well understood that the
underlying operator/matrix structure of the theory, exhibited by the Weyl map [77], is
the singular most important diﬀerence with commutative ﬁeld theory since it is at the
root cause of profound physical diﬀerences between the two theories. We suggest [75] and
references therein for elementary and illuminating discussion of the Moyal-Weyl product
and other star products and their relations to the Weyl map and coherent states.

Noncommutative ﬁeld theory is believed to be of importance to physics beyond the
standard model and the Hall eﬀect [106] and also to quantum gravity and string theory
[107, 108].

Noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theories are the most simple, at least conceptually, quan-
tum ﬁeld theories on noncommutative spaces. Some of the novel quantum properties of
noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory and scalar phi-four theory are as follows:

MFT, Badis Ydri

14

1. The planar diagrams in a noncommutative φ4 are essentially identical to the planar

diagrams in the commutative theory as shown originally in [83].

2. As it turns out, even the free noncommutative scalar ﬁeld is drastically diﬀerent
from its commutative counterpart contrary to widespread believe. For example,
it was shown in [116] that the eigenvalues distribution of a free scalar ﬁeld on a
noncommutative space with an arbitrary kinetic term is given by a Wigner semicircle
law. This is due to the dominance of planar diagrams which reduce the number of
independent contractions contributing to the expectation value < φ2n > from 2nn!
to the number Nplanar(2n) of planar contractions of a vertex with 2n legs. See
also [117–120] for an alternative derivation.

3. More interestingly, it was found in [84] that the renormalized one-loop action of a
noncommutative φ4 suﬀers from an infrared divergence which is obtained when we
send either the external momentum or the non-commutativity to zero. This non-
analyticity at small momenta or small non-commutativity (IR) which is due to the
high energy modes (UV) in virtual loops is termed the UV-IR mixing.

4. We can control the UV-IR mixing found in noncommutative φ4 by modifying the
large distance behavior of the free propagator through adding a harmonic oscillator
potential to the kinetic term [87]. More precisely, the UV-IR mixing of the theory
is implemented precisely in terms of a certain duality symmetry of the new action
which connects momenta and positions [92]. The corresponding Wilson-Polchinski
renormalization group equation [95, 96] of the theory can then be solved in terms of
ribbon graphs drawn on Riemann surfaces. Renormalization of noncommutative φ4
along these lines was studied for example in [85–91]. Other approaches to renormal-
ization of quantum noncommutative φ4 can be found for example in [100–105].

5. In two-dimensions the existence of a regular solution of the Wilson-Polchinski equa-
tion [95] together with the fact that we can scale to zero the coeﬃcient of the har-
monic oscillator potential in two dimensions leads to the conclusion that the standard
non-commutative φ4 in two dimensions is renormalizable [89]. In four dimensions,
the harmonic oscillator term seems to be essential for the renormalizability of the
theory [88].

6. The beta function of noncommutative φ4 theory at the self-dual point is zero to all
orders [97–99]. This means in particular that the theory is not asymptotically free in
the UV since the RG ﬂow of the coupling constant is bounded and thus the theory
does not exhibit a Landau ghost, i.e. not trivial. In contrast the commutative φ4
theory although also asymptotically free exhibits a Landau ghost.

7. Noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory can be non-perturbatively regularized using ei-
ther fuzzy projective spaces CPn [121] or fuzzy tori Tn [115]. The fuzzy tori are
intimately related to a lattice regularization whereas fuzzy projective spaces, and
fuzzy spaces [138, 139] in general, provide a symmetry-preserving sharp cutoﬀ regu-
larization. By using these regulators noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory on a maxi-
mally noncommuting space can be rewritten as a matrix model given by the sum of

MFT, Badis Ydri

15

kinetic (Laplacian) and potential terms. The geometry in encoded in the Laplacian
in the sense of [124, 125].

The case of degenerate noncommutativity is special and leads to a matrix model
only in the noncommuting directions. See for example [140] where it was also shown
that renormalizability in this case is reached only by the addition of the doubletrace

term(cid:82) dDx(T rφ)2 to the action.

8. Another matrix regularization of non-commutative φ4 can be found in [76, 93, 94]
where some exact solutions of noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory in background
magnetic ﬁelds are constructed explicitly. Furthermore, in order to obtain these exact
solutions matrix model techniques were used extensively and to great eﬃciency. For
a pedagogical introduction to matrix model theory see [?,141–145]. Exact solvability
and non-triviality is discussed at great length in [146].

9. A more remarkable property of quantum noncommutative φ4 is the appearance of
a new order in the theory termed the striped phase which was ﬁrst computed in a
one-loop self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation in the seminal paper [109]. For
alternative derivations of this order see for example [110,111]. It is believed that the
perturbative UV-IR mixing is only a manifestation of this more profound property.
As it turns out, this order should be called more appropriately a non-uniform ordered
phase in contrast with the usual uniform ordered phase of the Ising universality
class and it is related to spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. It was
numerically observed in d = 4 in [112] and in d = 3 in [113,114] where the Moyal-Weyl
space was non-perturbatively regularized by a noncommutative fuzzy torus [115].
The beautiful result of [113] shows explicitly that the minimum of the model shifts
to a non-zero value of the momentum indicating a non-trivial condensation and hence
spontaneous breaking of translational invariance.

10. Therefore, noncommutative scalar φ4 enjoys three stable phases: i) disordered (sym-
metric, one-cut, disk) phase, ii) uniform ordered (Ising, broken, asymmetric one-cut)
phase and iii) non-uniform ordered (matrix, stripe, two-cut, annulus) phase. This
picture is expected to hold for noncommutative/fuzzy phi-four theory in any dimen-
sion, and the three phases are all stable and are expected to meet at a triple point.
The non-uniform ordered phase [126] is a full blown nonperturbative manifestation
of the perturbative UV-IR mixing eﬀect [84] which is due to the underlying highly
non-local matrix degrees of freedom of the noncommutative scalar ﬁeld. In [109,110],
it is conjectured that the triple point is a Lifshitz point which is a multi-critical point
at which a disordered, a homogeneous (uniform) ordered and a spatially modulated
(non-uniform) ordered phases meet [127].

11. In [110] the triple (Lifshitz) point was derived using the Wilson renormalization
group approach [128], where it was also shown that the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point
of the theory at one-loop suﬀers from an instability at large non-commutativity.
See [135, 136] for a pedagogical introduction to the subject of the functional renor-
malization group. The Wilson renormalization group recursion formula was also
used in [130–134] to study matrix scalar models which, as it turns out, are of great

MFT, Badis Ydri

16

relevance to the limit θ −→ ∞ of noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory [137].

12. The phase structure of non-commutative φ4 in d = 2 and d = 3 using as a regulator
the fuzzy sphere was studied extensively in [147–153].
It was conﬁrmed that the
phase diagram consists of three phases: a disordered phase, a uniform ordered phases
and a non-uniform ordered phase which meet at a triple point.
In this case it is
well established that the transitions from the disordered phase to the non-uniform
ordered phase and from the non-uniform ordered phase to the uniform ordered phase
originate from the one-cut/two-cut transition in the quartic hermitian matrix model
[141,142]. The related problem of Monte Carlo simulation of noncommutative φ4 on
the fuzzy disc was considered in [154].

13. The above phase structure was also conﬁrmed analytically by the multitrace ap-
proach of [155, 156] which relies on a small kinetic term expansion instead of the
usual perturbation theory in which a small interaction potential expansion is per-
formed. This is very reminiscent of the Hopping parameter expansion on the lat-
tice [158–161]. See also [157] for a review and an extension of this method to the
noncommutative Moyal-Weyl plane. For an earlier approach see [116] and for a sim-
ilar more non-perturbative approach see [117–120]. This technique is expected to
capture the matrix transition between disordered and non-uniform ordered phases
with arbitrarily increasing accuracy by including more and more terms in the ex-
pansion. Capturing the Ising transition, and as a consequence the stripe transition,
is more subtle and is only possible if we include odd moments in the eﬀective action
and do not impose the symmetry φ −→ −φ.

14. The multitrace approach in conjunction with the renormalization group approach
and/or the Monte Carlo approach could be a very powerful tool in noncommutative
scalar ﬁeld theory. For example, multitrace matrix models are fully diagonalizable,
i.e. they depend on N real eigenvalues only, and thus ergodic problems are absent
and the phase structure can be probed quite directly. The phase boundaries, the
triple point and the critical exponents can then be computed more easily and more
eﬃciently. Furthermore, multitrace matrix models do not come with a Laplacian,
yet one can attach to them an emergent geometry if the uniform ordered phase is
sustained. See for example [169, 170]. Also, it is quite obvious that these multitrace
matrix models lend themselves quite naturally to the matrix renormalization group
approach of [163–166].

15. Among all the approaches discussed above, it is strongly believed that the renor-
malization group method is the only non-perturbative coherent framework in which
we can fully understand renormalizability and critical behavior of noncommutative
scalar ﬁeld theory in complete analogy with the example of commutative quantum
scalar ﬁeld theory outlined in [162]. The Wilson recursion formula, in particular,
is the oldest and most simple and intuitive renormalization group approach which
although approximate agrees very well with high temperature expansions [128]. In
this approximation we perform the usual truncation but also we perform a reduction
to zero dimension which allows explicit calculation, or more precisely estimation, of

MFT, Badis Ydri

17

Feynman diagrams. See [130–132]. This method was applied in [168] to noncommu-
tative scalar φ4 ﬁeld theory at the self-dual point with two strongly noncommuting
directions and in [167] to noncommutative O(N ) model.

2.1 Heisenberg Algebra and Coherent States

2.1.1 Representations of The Heisenberg-Weyl Algebra

Let us start with a dynamical system consisting of a single degree of freedom q with
Lagrangian L(q, ˙q). The phase space is two-dimensional with points given by (q, p) where
p = ∂L/∂ ˙q is the conjugate momentum. We deﬁne observables by functions f (q, p) on the
phase space. Canonical quantization introduces a Hilbert space H where the coordinate
operator ˆq, the momentum operator ˆp and the observable operators ˆf (ˆq, ˆp) act naturally.
The fundamental commutation relation is given by

[ˆq, ˆp] = i.

(2.1)
This is the famous Heisenberg-Weyl algebra W1 and it is the ﬁrst concrete example of a
noncommutative space. It deﬁnes, as we will see, the Moyal-Weyl noncommutative plane.
The subsequent discussion will follow closely [79] but also [187]. Related discussions

of coherent states can also be found in [77, 78, 80, 81].

The Heisenberg-Weyl algebra W1 algebra is a three-dimensional Lie algebra given by

the elements e1 = iˆp/

√, e2 = iˆq/

√ and e3 = i1. They satisfy

[e1, e2] = e3 , [e1, e3] = [e2, e3] = 0.

We introduce the annihilation and creation operators by

They satisfy

a =

ˆq + iˆp√

ˆq − iˆp√
2 .

[a, a+] = 1.

A general element of W1 is written as

x ≡ (s, x1, x2) = x1e1 + x2e2 + se3
= αa+ − α∗a + is.

α = − x1 − ix2√
√ and x2 = p/

√. We compute the commutator [x, y] =
As we will see later x1 = −q/
ω(x, y)e3 where ω(x, y) is the symplectic form on the plane (q, p), viz ω(x, y) = x1y2−x2y1.
The Heisenberg-Weyl algebra Lie group W1 is obtained by exponentiation of the Lie

algebra. A general element of W1 is given by

ex = eisD(α) , D(α) = eαa+−α∗a.

(2.7)
The multiplication law of the group elements D(α) is given by (with A = αa+ − α∗a and
B = βa+ − β∗a)

D(α)D(β) = eAeB

= exp

[A, B] exp(A + B)
(αβ∗ − α∗β)D(α + β).

(2.8)

In the second line we have used the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula. From this multi-
plication law it follows immediately that

D(α)D(β) = exp(αβ∗ − α∗β)D(β)D(α).

(2.9)

This is another form of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra completely equivalent to (2.1) or
(2.4). The operators D(α), as opposed to ˆq and ˆp, are bounded and as consequence
their domain of deﬁnition is the whole Hilbert space H. The algebra (2.9) is the deﬁning
equation of the noncommutative torus as we will also discuss in due time.

The elements ex = eisD(α) of the group W1 will be denoted by g. More precisely
eisD(α) should be viewed as a representation of the element g characterized by the real
number s and the operator D(α).

The center of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra W1 consists of all elements of the form
(s, 0, 0) which correspond to the group elements g0 = eis. It is then obvious that given
any unitary irreducible representation T (g) of the Heisenberg-Weyl group W1 the elements
T (g0) provide a unitary representation of the subgroup H = {g0}. Obviously

T (g0) = eiλs1.

(2.10)

The following result is due to Kirillov. The unitary irreducible representation T (g) for
λ (cid:54)= 0 is inﬁnite dimensional ﬁxed precisely by the real number λ whereas for λ = 0 the
unitary irreducible representation T (g) is one-dimensional ﬁxed by two real numbers µ
and ν given explicitly by T (g) = ei(µx1+νx2)1.

Obviously for a ﬁxed value of λ (cid:54)= 0 any two unitary irreducible representations are

unitarily equivalent. This is in fact a general result of representation theory.

2.1.2 Coherent States

The ﬁrst basis of the Hilbert space H, we consider here, is the number basis. We
introduce a vacuum state |0 > in the Hilbert space H deﬁned as usual by a|0 >= 0. The
number basis is deﬁned by
√
a|n >=

(2.11)
The number operator is deﬁned by N = a+a, viz N|n >= n|n >. Explicitly the number
basis is given by

n|n − 1 > , a+|n >=

n + 1|n + 1 > .

√

|n >=

1√
n!

(a+)n|0 > , n = 0, 1, 2, ...

(2.12)

Another very important basis of the Hilbert space H is provided by so-called coherent
states. A coherent state is a quantum state with properties as close as possible to classical
states. Let T (g) be a unitary irreducible representation of the Heisenberg-Weyl group W1
and let |ψ0 > be some ﬁxed vector in the Hilbert space H. We deﬁne now the coherent
state by

|ψg > = T (g)|ψ0 >

= eiλsD(α)|ψ0 > .

(2.13)
It is obvious that the isotropy subgroup of the state |ψ0 > (the maximal subgroup which
leaves |ψ0 > invariant or stable) is precisely H = {g0}. This crucial fact can also be
formulated as follows. For g = g0 we obtain from the above deﬁnition the behavior of
|ψ0 > under the action of H to be given by

T (g0)|ψ0 > = eiλs|ψ0 > .

(2.14)

By substituting back we obtain

|ψg > = e−iλsT (gg0)|ψ0 >

= e−iλs|ψgg0 > .

√

(2.15)
This means that all the group elements of the form gg0 with g ﬁxed and g0 ∈ H deﬁne
the same coherent state. In other words the coherent state |ψg > is an equivalence class
in W1/H given by |α >= {|ψgg0 > , g0 ∈ H}. The equivalence class is identiﬁed with
α = −(x1 − ix2)/
2 since we can choose g0 in such a way that it cancels precisely the
phase eiλs for all g. Alternatively we may think of G as a ﬁber bundle over the base
space X = G/H with ﬁber H where the choice g is a particular section. The base
space X = G/H is precisely the plane (q, p) and the coherent state |ψg > will contain
√). Indeed the coherent
information about the quantum point (x1 = −q/
state |ψg > is a mapping from the phase plane (q, p) into the Hilbert space H. We write
then the coherent state |ψg > as simply |α > where

√, x2 = p/

|α > = D(α)|ψ0 > .

(2.16)

MFT, Badis Ydri

21

The standard coherent state corresponds to the choice |ψ0 >= |0 >. We will only concen-
trate on this case for simplicity. The coherent state |α > is an eigenstate of the annihilation
operator a with eigenvalue α. The proof goes as follows. By using the Baker-Campbell-
Hausdorﬀ formula we compute ﬁrst the following
D(α) = e− 1
2|α|2
2|α|2

e−α∗a

The coherent state can then be expressed as

(2.18)

The coherent states |α >, although complete (overcomplete) because the representation

The action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group W1 is therefore equivalent to the action of the
group of translations in the α plane modulo a phase. Indeed this action is not eﬀective
since the whole subgroup H = {g0} acts as the identity.
In other words the group of

obviously given by

(2.23)

The invariant measure in the α plane is then given by

(cid:90)

dµ(α) = Cdα∗dα = Cdx1dx2.

Let us consider the projector |α >< α| on the coherent state |α > and let us consider the

operator(cid:82) dµ(α)|α >< α|. We compute (using D(β)+ = D(−β), dµ(α) = dµ(α + β) and

in the coherent states basis using the resolution of unity as follows

of the state |ψ >. This provides a functional realization of the Hilbert space H as we will

The sum (2.35) is absolutely convergent for all z ∈ C. The proof goes as follows. By

The ratio of the n + 1th term to the nth term is |α|/
n + 1 which goes to 0 as n −→ 0.
Hence the sum (2.35) is absolutely convergent for all z ∈ C and as a consequence ψ(α)
is an entire or integral function. We note that only entire functions subjected to some
growth restriction are in fact allowed.

The normalization condition can be chosen to be given by

Operator Symbols: A large class of operators acting on the Hilbert space H can also

Let us now imagine that the diagonal matrix elements ˜A(α∗, α) vanish, viz ˜A(α∗, α) = 0.
In order for this to be true an entire function of the variables α∗ and β deﬁned precisely
by the above double series must vanish on the domain given by β = α in C2. A known
result from complex analysis states that if an entire two-variable function vanishes on
the domain β = α for all α it must vanish identically everywhere in C2. In other words
˜A(α∗, β) = 0 for all α and β and as a consequence the operator itself vanishes identically,
viz ˆA = 0.

It is a general result that the diagonal matrix elements of an operator ˆA (bounded1 or
a polynomial in a and a+) in the coherent states basis determine completely the operator.
This can also be seen as follows. By introducing new variables u = (α∗ + β)/2 and
v = i(α∗ − β)/2 the matrix element ˜A(α∗, β) deﬁnes an entire function of u and v given
by F (u, v) = ˜A(α∗, β). Any entire function of complex variables u and v is determined
completely by its values at real u and v. Alternatively every monomial (α∗)nαm in the
double series deﬁning ˜A(α∗, α) = 0 is uniquely analytically continued to (α∗)nβm. This
is precisely the statement that the operator ˆA is determined completely by its diagonal
matrix elements

QA = A(α∗, α) = exp(−|α|2) ˜A(α∗, α) =< α| ˆA|α > .

(2.47)
This is called the Q symbol or lower symbol of the operator ˆA. Let us derive this crucial
result in a more explicit fashion. We have

QA = e−|α|2

< 0|eα∗a ˆAeαa+|0 > , ˜A(α∗, α) =< 0|eα∗a ˆAeαa+|0 > .

We then compute

2.2 Noncommutativity From a Strong Magnetic
Field

The relation between the noncommutative star product and path integral quantization

was noted a long time ago in [193].

The quantization of a non-relativistic electron in a strong magnetic ﬁeld will lead to
noncommutative coordinates. We will follow here the brief discussion found in [191, 192].
We consider a point particle of mass m and charge q moving in an electromagnetic

ﬁeld ( (cid:126)E, (cid:126)B). The equation of motion is given by the Lorentz force

m

d2(cid:126)r

dt2 = q( (cid:126)E + (cid:126)v ∧ (cid:126)B).

(2.103)

In terms of the 4−vector gauge potential Aµ = (V, (cid:126)A) the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (cid:126)E
and (cid:126)B are given by

(cid:126)E = −(cid:126)∇V − ∂ (cid:126)A
∂t

, (cid:126)B = (cid:126)∇ × (cid:126)A.

The Lorentz force reads explicitly

m

dt2 = q(−∂iV − ∂Ai

+ ˙xj∂iAj − ˙xj∂jAi)

).

(2.104)

(2.105)

We can trivially check that this equation of motion can be derived from the Lagrangian

L =

Now we consider motion conﬁned to the xy plane under the inﬂuence of a constant perpen-
dicular magnetiz ﬁeld, viz (cid:126)E = 0, (cid:126)B = B ˆz. We have then Ax = Ax(x, y), Ay = Ay(x, y),
Az = 0 and V = 0. The conjugate momenta and the Hamiltonian are given by

pi = m ˙xi + qAi , i = 1, 2.

(2.108)

We will also need the usual momenta

πi = m ˙xi = pi − qAi , i = 1, 2.

(2.109)
We have B = ∂xAy − ∂yAx. We know that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are invariant
(physically observable) under the gauge transformations V −→ V +∂V /∂t, (cid:126)A −→ (cid:126)A− (cid:126)∇χ.
In the symmetric gauge we can choose Ax = −By/2 and Ay = Bx/2, i.e. Ai = −Bijxj/2.
In the quantum theory xi and pi become operators ˆxi and ˆpi satisfying the commutation

relations

Equivalently we have

[ˆxi, ˆpj] = iδij , [ˆxi, ˆxj] = 0 , [ˆpi, ˆpj] = 0.

(2.110)

[ˆxi, ˆπj] = iδij , [ˆxi, ˆxj] = 0 , [ˆπi, ˆπj] = q[ˆpj, ˆAi] − q[ˆpi, ˆAj]
= iq∂iAj − iq∂jAi
= iqBij.

We introduce the creation and annihilation operators ˆa and ˆa+ by
(ˆπx − iˆπy).

energy levels, are given by

(2.119)

These levels are inﬁnitely degenerate which we will now show.

We introduce the so-called guiding center coordinates by imposing on them the re-
quirement that they commute with the momenta πi. After some work we ﬁnd that the
correct deﬁnition is given by

In analogy with the creation and annihilation operators ˆa and ˆa+ corresponding to ˆπi we
introduce the creation and annihilation operators ˆb and ˆb+ corresponding to ˆRi by

ˆb =

(2.122)

(2.123)

(2.124)

(2.125)

The Landau energy levels are inﬁnitely degenerate simply because they do not depend on
the eigenvalues m of the number operator ˆb+ˆb.

The ground energy level n = 0 is the lowest Landau level (LLL) which is deﬁned by

the condition

ˆaψ(z, ¯z) = −i(∂¯z +

)ψ(z, ¯z) = 0.

There is an inﬁnite number of solutions given by

ψm(z, ¯z) =

zm√
m!

exp(−|z|2

2

).

(2.126)

(2.127)

It is not diﬃcult to observe that ψm ∼ (ˆb+)mψ0, i.e. we can obtain all the LLLs by acting
repeatedly with ˆb+ on the Gaussian wave function ψ0 = exp(−|z|2/2).

The angular momentum is computed to be

L =


i

(x∂y − y∂x)
= (z∂z − ¯z∂¯z).

(2.128)

Thus we can see immediately that the wave function ψm carries angular momentum L = m
and as a consequence the Gaussian wave function ψ0 = exp(−|z|2/2) carries zero angular
momentum, viz

Lψm(z, ¯z) = mψm(z, ¯z).

(2.129)

Much more importantly is the fact that the LLL wave function ψm(z, ¯z) can be understood
as the component of the coherent state |z > on the number vector state |m >. Indeed
from (2.18) we have

exp(−|z|2

).

(2.130)

ψm(z, ¯z) = < z|m >=

We have made the identiﬁcation α = ¯z or equivalently x1 = −x(cid:112)qB/ and x2 =
−y(cid:112)qB/. We know from the Heisenberg algebra (2.1) that [ˆx1, ˆx2] = −i and hence

we expect that within the LLLs we will have [ˆx, ˆy]LLL = −i/qB. We will now show this
result in some detail.
In the strong magnetic ﬁeld limit B −→ ∞ the cyclotron frequency becomes very large
and therefore the gap between the LLLs and the higher Landau levels becomes very large.
The dynamics becomes thus largely described by the LLLs. The LLLs provide then an
overcomplete basis in this limit simply because they are identiﬁed with coherent states.
Indeed from (2.33) and (2.34) we know that every state vector in the Hilbert space can
be expanded in terms of the coherent states |z > as

|ψ >=

dµ(z) exp(−|z|2

The wave functions um, as opposed to ψm(z, ¯z), are analytic. They are essentially the
lowest Landau levels without the exponential decay, namely

um(z) = exp(

)ψm(z, ¯z).

The scalar product is deﬁned by (2.38), viz

(2.135)

In the second line we have dropped a surface term. Thus within the lowest Landau
levels, which dominate the dynamics in the strong magnetic ﬁeld limit, we can make the
identiﬁcation ∂z −→ ¯z and as a consequence we have 1 = [∂z, z]LLL = [¯z, z]LLL. This is
equivalent to the commutation relation

[ˆx, ˆy]LLL = −iθ , θ =

This is a noncommutative plane.

2.3 Noncommutative Moyal-Weyl Spacetimes

In this section we will follow the reviews [106,194], as well as the articles [93,115], and

the articles [76, 87–89, 92, 94, 195].

2.3.1 Algebra, Weyl Map, Derivation and Integral/Trace

A Groenewold-Moyal-Weyl spacetime Rd

θ is a deformation of ordinary d dimensional
Euclidean spacetime Rd in which the coordinates xi are replaced with Hermitian operators
ˆxi satisfying the Heisenberg-Weyl commutation relations

[ˆxi, ˆxj] = iθij.

(2.137)

The space Rd
θ in general can be only partially non-commutative, i.e. the Poisson tensor
θij is of rank 2r≤d. This means in particular that we have only 2r non-commuting
coordinates. The Poisson tensor, also known as the noncommutativity parameter, can thus

MFT, Badis Ydri

be brought by means of an appropriate linear transformation of the coordinate operators
to the canonical form

(2.138)

In the above equation θr = θ2r−12r. In the spirit of Connes’ noncommutative geometry
[124], we will describe the Groenewold-Moyal-Weyl spacetime Rd
θ in terms of the algebra of
functions on Rd, endowed with an associative noncommutative product between elements
f and g denoted by f ∗ g. This star product is, precisely, the Groenewold-Moyal-Weyl
star product derived in previous sections. The algebra corresponding to the space Rd
θ
will be denoted Aθ. The algebra A0 corresponding to the commutative space Rd is
clearly the algebra of functions on Rd with the usual pointwise multiplication of functions.
Speciﬁcation of the algebra will determine only topological properties of the space Rd
θ.
In order to specify the metric aspects we must also deﬁne proper derivation operations
on the algebra Aθ. The Weyl map will allow us to map the algebra Aθ to the correct
operator algebra generated by the coordinate operators ˆxi.

The algebra of functions on Rd, of interest to us here, is the algebra of Schwartz
functions of suﬃciently rapid decrease at inﬁnity. These are functions with all their
derivatives vanishing at inﬁnity. Equivalently Schwartz functions are functions f (x) which
admit well deﬁned Fourier transforms ˜f (k), viz

˜f (k) =

ddxf (x)e−ikx.

(2.139)

The Fourier transforms ˜f (k) are also Schwartz functions, i.e.
their derivatives to any
order vanish at inﬁnity in momentum space. The functions f (x) are given by the inverse
Fourier transforms, viz

f (x) =

ddk
(2π)d

˜f (k)eikx.

(2.140)

The Weyl operator ˆf acting in some, inﬁnite dimensional separable, Hilbert space H which
corresponds to the function f (x) is obtained by requiring that f (x) is the Weyl symbol of
ˆf . In analogy with the Weyl map between (2.61) and (2.64) we can immediately deduce
the form of the operator ˆf to be given by

ˆf =

ddk
(2π)d

˜f (k)eikˆx.

(2.141)

We have only replaced the coordinates xi by the coordinate operators ˆxi. This is a bounded
operator which is also compact.

(cid:90)

For simplicity we will assume maximal noncommutativity, i.e. d = 2r. The Weyl map,

or quantizer, is given by

∆(ˆxi, xi) =

(cid:90)

ddk

(2π)d eiki ˆxie−ikixi.

(2.142)

As we have discussed previously this correspond to the symmetric ordering of the operator.
We have explicitly

ˆf =

ddxf (xi)∆(ˆxi, xi).

(2.143)

It is obvious that if f = fk = exp(ikx) then ˆf = ˆfk = exp(ikˆx), viz

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

exp(ikˆx) =

ddx exp(ikx)∆(ˆxi, xi).

(2.145)

The coordinate operators ˆxR
derivative operators satisfy the conditions

i act on the right of the algebra, viz ˆxR
i

ˆf = ˆf ˆxi. These

[ ˆ∂i, ˆ∂j] = 0 , [ ˆ∂i, ˆxj] = δij.

(2.146)

θ can also be given by any outer derivations satisfying the

above two requirements.

We have the basic identity

(2.147)

In the second line we have used the second equation of (2.146) which is valid for all
derivations inner or outer. We have therefore the result

This suggest that we associate the operator [ ˆ∂i, ˆf ] with the function ∂if (xi). The proof
goes as follows. First we have

(cid:90)

[ ˆ∂i, ˆf ] =

ddk
(2π)d iki ˜f (k)eikˆx.
(cid:90)

[ ˆ∂i, ∆(ˆxi, xi)] =

(2π)d ikieiki ˆxie−ikixi

= −∂i∆(ˆxi, xi).

(2.148)

(2.149)

MFT, Badis Ydri

39

By using the above result we have

[ ˆ∂i, ˆf ] =

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

(cid:90)

ddxf (xi)[ ˆ∂i, ∆(ˆxi, xi)]

= −

ddxf (xi)∂i∆(ˆxi, xi)

=

ddx∂if (xi)∆(ˆxi, xi).

(2.150)

In other words the operator [ ˆ∂i, ˆf ] corresponds to the function ∂if (xi) as it should be.
In the commutative limit θ−→0 the operator ∆(ˆxi, xi) reduces in an obvious way to
the delta function δ2(ˆx − x). This is in fact obvious from (2.144). For αi∈R we compute

eα ˆ∂eikˆxe−α ˆ∂ = e

i

2 αkeα ˆ∂+ikˆxe−α ˆ∂

= eiαkeikˆx.

(2.151)

The unitary operator exp(α ˆ∂) corresponds to a translation operator in spacetime by a
vector (cid:126)α. By using the above result we obtain

eα ˆ∂∆(ˆxi, xi)e−α ˆ∂ = ∆(ˆxi, xi − αi).

(2.152)
We can then conclude that T rH∆(ˆxi, xi) is independent of x for any trace T rH on H
since T rH∆(ˆxi, xi) = T rH∆(ˆxi, xi − αi). In other words T rH∆(ˆxi, xi) is simply an averall
normalization which we can choose appropriately. We choose (see below for a derivation
of this overall normalization in the Landau basis)

1(cid:112)det(2πθ)

.

In some sense(cid:112)det(2πθ) is the volume of an elementary cell in noncommutative spacetime

T rH∆(ˆxi, xi) =

(2.153)

if we think of Rd

θ as a phase space. This can also be understood from the result

ddxeikx = (2π)dδd(k).

(2.154)

Similarly we can compute (cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆf =

(cid:90)

ddxf (xi).

(2.155)

(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rHeikˆx =

(cid:90)

The analogue of the identity (2.153) is the identity

(cid:90)

ddx∆(ˆxi, xi) = 1.

(2.156)

We want now to show that the Weyl map is indeed one-to-one. The proof goes as follows.

First we compute(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rHeikˆxeipˆx = (cid:112)det(2πθ)T re− i

2 θij kipj ei(k+p)ˆx

= (2π)dδd(k + p).

Hence(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH∆(ˆxi, xi)∆(ˆxi, yi) =

(cid:90)

(2π)d e−ikx

= δ2(x − y).

(cid:90)

(2π)d e−ipy(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rHeikˆxeipˆx

ddp

Using this last formula one can immediatey deduce

f (xi) =(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆf ∆(ˆxi, xi).

(2.158)

(2.159)

This shows explicitly that the Weyl map ∆ provides indeed a one-to-one correspondence
between ﬁelds and operators.

2.3.2 Star Product and Scalar Action

The most natural problem now is to determine the image under the Weyl map of the
pointwise product ˆf ˆg of the two operators ˆf and ˆg. From our previous discussion of the
coherent states we know that the answer is given by the star product f ∗ g where ∗ is the
Groenewold-Moyal-Weyl product (2.101). We rederive this fundamental result one more
time in this section.

First we compute the generalization of (2.157) given by

This leads immediately to

(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rHeikˆxeipˆxeiqˆx = e− i
(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH∆(ˆx, y)∆(ˆx, z)∆(ˆx, x) =
(cid:90)

Hence (cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆf ˆg∆(ˆxi, xi) =

2 θij kipj (2π)dδd(k + p + q).

The above result can also be put in the form

(cid:90)
(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆf ˆg ≡

ˆf ˆg =

This leads to the identity

ddxf ∗ g(xi)∆(ˆxi, xi).

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

ddx f ∗ g(x) =

ddxf (x)g(x).

(2.165)

(2.163)

(2.164)

MFT, Badis Ydri

41

From the other hand we know that the operator [ ˆ∂i, ˆf ] corresponds to the function ∂if (xi).
We can then also write down

(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH[ ˆ∂i, ˆf ]2 ≡

(cid:90)

ddx ∂if ∗ ∂if (x) =

respectively. Indeed we have(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆΦ∆(ˆxi, xi) = Φ(x).
(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆΦ2∆(ˆxi, xi) = Φ ∗ Φ(x).
(cid:112)det(2πθ)T rH ˆΦ4∆(ˆxi, xi) = Φ ∗ Φ ∗ Φ ∗ Φ (x).

Hence we must have immediately

2.3.3 The Langmann-Szabo-Zarembo Models

In this section, we will write down the most general action, with a phi-four interaction,
in a non-commutative Rd
θ, under the eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld which induces noncommu-
tivity also in momentum space. Then, we will regularize the partition function of the
theory by replacing the ﬁeld operator ˆΦ by an N × N matrix M , and also replacing the
inﬁnite dimensional trace T rH by a ﬁnite dimensional trace T rN . The resulting theory is a
single-trace matrix model, with a matrix phi-four interaction, and a modiﬁed propagator.
We will mostly follow [93].

For simplicity, we start by considering a 2−dimensional Euclidean spacetime, with
non-commutativity given by θij. Generalization to higher dimension will be sketched in
section (2.3.5). We also introduce non-commutativity in momentum space, by introducing
a minimal coupling to a constant background magnetic ﬁeld Bij. The derivation operators
become

ˆDi = ˆ∂i − iBijXj , ˆCi = ˆ∂i + iBijXj.

The case σ = ˜σ corresponds to the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model [87–89], while the model

Let us introduce the operators Z = X1 + iX2, ¯Z = Z+ = X1 − iX2, ˆ∂ = ˆ∂1 − i ˆ∂2
¯ˆ∂ = − ˆ∂+ = ˆ∂1 + i ˆ∂2. Also introduce the creation and annihilation operators (with

The inﬁnite dimensional matrix M should be thought of, as a compact operator, acting on
some separable Hilbert space H1 of Schwartz sequences, with suﬃciently rapid decrease
[93]. This, in particular, will guarantee the convergence of the expansions of the scalar
operators ˆΦ, and ˆΦ+.

The representation of this operator product, in terms of the star product of functions, can
be obtained as follows. In the operators ˆφl,m = |l >< m|, we can identify the kets |l >
with the states of the harmonic oscillator operators ˆa, and ˆa+, whereas the bras < m|
can be identiﬁed with the states of the harmonic oscillator operators ˆb, and ˆb+. More
precisely, the operators ˆφl,m are, in one-to-one correspondence, with the wave functions
φl,m(x) =< x|l, m > known as Landau states [76, 195]. These states will be constructed
explicitly in appendix A. Landau states are deﬁned by

This action enjoys, a remarkable, symmetry under certain duality transformations which
exchange, among other things, positions and momenta. See [92–94] for the original deriva-
tion. This property can be shown as follows. We start with the quadratic action given
by

Then, we can immediately compute that

(cid:90)

d2˜k ( ˜Di ¯Φ)+(˜k)( ˜Di ¯Φ)(˜k).

(2.211)

The new ﬁeld, ¯Φ, is deﬁned by

¯Φ(˜k) =

(cid:114)

|det

B
2π

(2.212)

A similar result holds for the other quadratic terms. By renaming the variable as ˜k = x,
we can see that the resulting quadratic action has, therefore, the same form as the original
quadratic action, viz

S2[Φ, B] = S2[ ¯Φ, B].

(2.213)

(2.217)

We can see immediately from comparing equations (2.216), and (2.217), to equations
(2.218), and (2.219), that the interaction term in momentum space, has the same form as

strong noncommutativity limit, in which N/θ (and thus Λ) is kept ﬁxed, was considered.

2.3.5 The Grosse-Wulkenhaar Model

We will be mostly interested in the so-called Grosse-Wulkenhaar model. This contains,
compared with the usual case, a harmonic oscillator term in the Laplacian, which modiﬁes,
and thus allows us, to control the IR behavior of the theory. This model is perturbatively
renormalizable, which makes it, the more interesting. The Grosse-Wulkenhaar model,
corresponds to the values σ = ˜σ (cid:54)= 0, so that the mixing term, in (2.178), cancels. We
consider, without any loss of generality, σ = ˜σ = 1/4. We obtain therefore the action

Similarly, to ˜xi = 2(θ−1)ijxj, we have deﬁned ˜Xi = 2(θ−1)ijXj. This action, is also
found, to be covariant under a duality transformation which exchanges, among other
things, positions and momenta as xi ↔ ˜pi = B−1
ij pj. Let us note here, that because of
the properties of the star product, the phi-four interaction, is actually invariant under
this duality transformation. The value Ω2 = 1, gives an action which is invariant under
this duality transformation, i.e. the kinetic term becomes invariant under this duality
transformation for Ω2 = 1.

In the Landau basis, the above action, reads

to be µ2, λ, and Ω2.

In order to be able to proceed, we will assume that the noncommutativity tensor θ, and
the magnetic tensor B, are simultaneously diagonalizable. In other words, θ and B, can
be brought together, to the canonical form (2.138). For example, in four dimension, we
will have

The d−dimensional problem will, thus, split into a direct sum, of n independent, and
identical, two-dimensional problems.

The expansion of the scalar ﬁeld operator is, now, given by

And

(2.244)
The quantum numbers li, and mi correspond to the plane x2i−1− x2i. They correspond to
the operators ˆx2i−1, ˆx2i, ˆ∂2i−1, and ˆ∂2i, or equivalently, to the creation, and annihilation
operators ˆa(i), ˆa(i)+, ˆb(i), ˆb(i)+. Indeed, the full Hilbert space Hn, in this case, is a direct
sum of the individual Hilbert spaces H(i)

1 , associated, with the individual planes.

The above action can be given, in terms of the compact operators M and M +, by

essentially equation (2.232). The explicit detail will be left as an exercise.

The Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, in higher dimensions, corresponds, as before, to the
values σ = ˜σ = 1/4. However, in higher dimensions, we need also to choose the magnetic
ﬁeld B, such that

Bθ = 2Ω1.

2.3.6 A Sphere Basis

Since we have two sets of creation and annihilation operators we can construct the

following SU (2) algebra (we drop here the hats for ease of notation)

J+ = J1 + iJ2 = a+b,J− = J1 − iJ2 = b+a , J3 =

(a+a − b+b).

The goal next is to write down the corresponding matrix model, i.e. we want to replace
the inﬁnite dimensional trace T rH with a ﬁnite N−dimensional trace. The xµ−dependent
operators ˆΦ will be replaced with xµ−dependent N × N matrices. The resulting theory
for d = 2 is a scalar ﬁeld theory on the noncommutative fuzzy torus T2
N . As it turns out
this can also be obtained by putting the noncommutative scalar ﬁeld theory on R2
θ on a
ﬁnite periodic N × N lattice. Generalization to d ≥ 3 is trivial since the extra directions
are assumed to be commuting. The relation between the matrix and lattice degrees of
freedom will now be explained. See also [112, 115].

We start by deﬁning the lattice theory and we only consider d = 2. First we restrict
the points to xi ∈ aZ where a is the lattice spacing. The momentum in each direction
will be assumed to have the usual periodicity k1 −→ k1 + 2π
a , k2 −→ k2 or k1 −→ k1,
k2 −→ k2 + 2π

a . The periodicity over the Brillouin zone will then read

ei(pi+ 2π

a δij )ˆxi = eipi ˆxi , j = 1, 2.

This equation can be put into the form

ei 2π

a ˆxj ei π

a θij pi = 1 , j = 1, 2.

We obtain the quantization condition

θijpi ∈ 2aZ , j = 1, 2.

(2.255)

(2.256)

(2.257)

This condition is characteristic of noncommutativity. It is not present in the commutative
case θ = 0. The above equation (2.256) becomes

ei 2π

a ˆxj = 1 , j = 1, 2.

(2.258)

In other words the eigenvalues of ˆxi for a ﬁxed i are on a one-dimensional lattice with
lattice spacing a. But since ˆx1 and ˆx2 do not commute the lattice sites are really fuzzy.
We can also immediately compute

evj ˆ∂j e

2πi

a ˆxi e−vj ˆ∂j = e

2πi

a (ˆxi+vi) , i = 1, 2.

(2.259)

MFT, Badis Ydri

52

This relation means that vi must be like the eigenvalues of ˆxi, i.e vi ∈ aZ. Thus the
derivatives will be given by the shift operators

ˆDi = ea ˆ∂i , i = 1, 2.

By assuming that [ ˆ∂i, ˆ∂j] = iBij we ﬁnd

ˆDi ˆDj = eia2Bij ˆDj ˆDi.

(2.260)

(2.261)

The quantization condition (2.257) indicates that the two dimensional noncommutative
space must be compact. We consider the periodic boundary conditions

φ(x1 + Σ11, x2 + Σ21) = φ(x1, x2)
φ(x1 + Σ12, x2 + Σ22) = φ(x1, x2).

(2.262)

The periods Σij are integer multiples of the lattice spacing a. These last two equations
lead to the momentum quantization

kiΣij = 2πmj ⇔ ki = 2π(Σ)−1

ji mj , mj ∈ Z.

(2.263)

The momentum periodicity ki −→ k
mj the form mj −→ m
(cid:48)
j = mj + 1
such that θijki ∈ 2aZ we get a restriction on the integers mi given by

a δij, j = 1, 2 takes in terms of the integers
a Σij, i = 1, 2. Since the momentum ki is restricted to be

(cid:48)
i = ki + 2π

Thus there must exist a 2 × 2 integer-valued matrix M given by

θijΣ−1

ki mk ∈ Z.

π
a

M T = − π
a

Σ−1θ.

The components of this matrix M must therefore satisfy

MikΣjk =

π
a

θij.

(2.264)

(2.265)

(2.266)

Thus lattice regularization of noncommutativity requires compactness. The continuum
limit is a −→ 0. Keeping M and θ ﬁxed we see that in the continuum limit a −→ 0 the
period matrix Σ goes to inﬁnity, i.e the infrared cutoﬀ disappears. In the commutative
limit θ −→ 0 and keeping a ﬁxed the matrix M goes to zero. The continuum limit does
not commute with the commutative limit. This is the source of the UV-IR mixing in the
quantum theory.

Due to the periodicity condition φ(xi + Σij) = φ(xi) with j = 1, 2 we can use instead

of the coordinate operators ˆxi, i = 1, 2 the coordinate operators

ˆZj = e2πiΣ−1

ji ˆxi , j = 1, 2.

integer-valued matrix the noncommutativity parameters Θij must be rational-valued.

The algebra of the noncommutative torus admits a ﬁnite dimensional representation when
the noncommutativity parameter Θ12 is a rational number which is the case here since
N Θ12 = 2. The dimension of this representation is exactly N . This is the fuzzy torus. In
this case the algebra of the noncommutative torus is Morita equivalent to the algebra of
smooth functions on the ordinary torus. More precisely the algebra of the noncommutative
torus is a twisted matrix bundle over the algebra of smooth functions on the ordinary
torus of topological charge N Θ12 = 2 where the ﬁbers are the algebras of complex N × N

2.4.2 The Fuzzy Disc of Lizzi-Vitale-Zampini

The original construction can be found in [180–183] with some related discussions

found in [184, 185].

The starting point is the algebra of functions on the noncommutative plane and then
implementing the constraint x2 + y2 ≤ R2. Let the algebra of functions on the non-
commutative plane be denoted by Aθ = (F(R2),∗) where ∗ is the Voros star product
(f ∗ g)(¯z, z) =< z| ˆf ˆg|z >. This algebra is isomorphic to an algebra of inﬁnite dimensional

The Fuzzy Sphere

3.1 Quantization of S2
3.1.1 The Algebra C∞(S2) and The Coadjoint Orbit SU (2)/U (1)

We start by reformulating, some of the relevant aspects of the the ordinary diﬀerential
geometry of the two-sphere S2, in algebraic terms. The sphere is a two-dimensional
compact manifold deﬁned by the set of all points (x1, x2, x3) of R3 which satisfy

x2
1 + x2

2 + x2

3 = R2.

(3.1)
The algebra A = C∞(S2) of smooth, complex valued, and bounded functions on the
sphere, is of course, commutative with respect to the pointwise multiplication of functions.
A basis for this algebra, can be chosen to be provided, by the spherical harmonics Ylm(θ, φ),
namely

The derivations on S2 will be given, by the generators of the rotation group La, deﬁned
by

They satisfy

La = −iabcxb∂c.

[La,Lb] = iabcLc.

The Laplacian on the sphere S2 will be, obviously, given by

∆ = L2

= LaLa , eigenvalues = l(l + 1) , l = 0, ...,∞.

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

MFT, Badis Ydri

62

According to [125, 196], all the geometry of the sphere, is encoded in the K-cycle, or
spectral triple, (A,H, ∆). H is the inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space, of square integrable
functions, on which the functions of A are represented. Alternatively, H can be thought
of as the Hilbert space with basis provided by the standard inﬁnite dimensional set of
kets {|(cid:126)x >}, and thus the action of an element f of A on |(cid:126)x >, will give the value of this
function at the point (cid:126)x.

In order to encode the geometry of the sphere, in the presence of spin structure, we use
instead the K-cycle (A,H,D, γ), where γ, and D are the chirality, and the Dirac operator
on the sphere [124].

A manifestly SU (2)−invariant description of A can also be given following [172]. In
this case, the algebra A is given by the quotient of the algebra C∞(R3) of all smooth
functions on R3, by its ideal I consisting of all functions of the form h(x)(xaxa − R2).
Let f, g∈A, and f (x),g(x) are their representatives in C∞(R3) respectively, then a scalar
product on A is given by

(cid:90)

(f, g) =

1

2πR

d3xδ(xaxa − R2)f∗(x)g(x).

(3.6)

(3.7)

We can also deﬁne the sphere by the Hopf ﬁbration (with na = xa/R)

π : SU (2) −→ S2

We can check, by squaring both sides of the equation gσ3g−1 = (cid:126)n.(cid:126)σ, that (cid:80)3

g −→ gσ3g−1 = (cid:126)n.(cid:126)σ.

i=1 n2

a = 1.

Clearly the structure group, U (1), of the principal ﬁber bundle

U (1)−→SU (2)−→S2,

(3.8)

leaves the base point (cid:126)n invariant, in the sense that, all the elements g exp(iσ3θ/2) of
SU (2), are projected onto the same point (cid:126)n on the base manifold S2. One can then,
identify the point (cid:126)n∈S2, with the equivalence class [g exp(iσ3θ/2)]∈SU (2)/U (1), viz

(cid:126)n ∈ S2 ←→ [g exp(iσ3θ/2)]∈SU (2)/U (1).

(3.9)

In other words, S2 is the orbit of SU (2) through the Pauli matrix σ3.
It is the set
{g σ3 g−1 : g ∈ SU (2)}. The sphere is, therefore, the co-adjoint orbit SU (2)/U (1). In
fact, SU (2)/U (1), is also the complex projective space CP1. We have then

(3.10)
Let us say few more words about this important result [79]. Any element g ∈ G = SU (2)
can be parameterized by

S2 = CP1 = SU (2)/U (1).

, |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.

(3.11)

In other words, SU (2) is topologically equivalent to the three-dimensional sphere S3. This
group contains the subgroup of diagonal matrices

is isomorphic to the elements of G of the form

we obtain n1 = 2αβ1, n2 = 2αβ2, and n3 = 2α2 − 1, or equivalently

3.1.2 The Symplectic Form d cos θ ∧ dφ

The symplectic two-form on the sphere S2 is dcosθ ∧ dφ. This can also be given by the

two-form −ijknkdni∧dnj/2. Thus, we have

ω = Λd cos θ∧dφ = − Λ
2

abcnadnb∧dnc.

(3.15)

The signiﬁcance of the real number Λ will be clariﬁed shortly. We claim that this sym-
plectic two-form can be rewritten, in terms of the group element g ∈ SU (2), as

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

ω = Λid

T rσ3g−1dg

.

(3.16)

This can be seen as follows. From d(gσ3g−1) = dna.σa, we get [dg.g−1, naσa] = dnaσa,
which indicates that dg.g−1 is in the Lie algebra, viz dg.g−1 = raσa. From [raσa, naσa] =
dnaσa, we derive dnc = 2iabcranb. We can express ra, in terms of na and dna, as follows

ra − ((cid:126)r(cid:126)n)na =

1
2i

abcnbdnc.

We can, then, show immediately that

ω = −iΛT rgσ3g−1.dgg−1 ∧ dgg−1

= 2Λabcnarbrc
= − Λ
2

abcnadnb∧dnc.

(3.17)

(3.18)

It is not diﬃcult to show that the two-form ω is gauge invariant, under the right U (1)
gauge transformations g −→ g exp(iθσ3/2). This gauge invariance can also be seen, from
the fact, that we can express ω in terms of na. As a consequce, a gauge invariant action
SWZ, can be constructed out of the two-form ω, as follows [197]

(cid:90)

SWZ =

ω.

(3.19)

This is the so-called Wess-Zumino action. The domain of the integration is clearly two-
dimensional, and also it must be closed, as we now explain.

MFT, Badis Ydri

Let us think of ni as the coordinates of a string, parameterized by σ ∈ [0, 1], moving
on the sphere S2. Thus ni = ni(σ, t), where t is the time variable which goes, say, from t1
to t2. Hence, g = g(σ, t). We will assume that g(0, t) = g0, where g0 is some ﬁxed element
of SU (2), and we set g(1, t) = g(t). If one deﬁnes the triangle ∆ in the plane (t, σ), by its
boundaries given by the three paths ∂∆1 = (σ, t1) , ∂∆2 = (σ, t2) and ∂∆3 = (1, t), then
it is a trivial exercise to show that [197]

(3.21)

The Wess-Zumino Lagrangian L is given by

LWZ = ΛiT r(σ3g−1 ˙g).

The equations of motion derived from the action (3.20), are precisely those, obtained from
the Wess-Zumino term given by (5.182). This is, because, the second term of (3.20), will
not contribute to the equations of motion, since it involves the ﬁxed initial, and ﬁnal
times, where g is not varied.

The Lagrangian LWZ arises, generally, when one tries to avoid singularities of the
phase space. In other words, when one tries to ﬁnd a smooth global system of canonical
coordinates for the phase space. In such cases, a global Lagrangian can not be found by
a simple Legendre transformation of the Hamiltonian, and therefore, one needs to enlarge
the conﬁguration space. A global Lagrangian, over this new extended conﬁguration space,
can then be shown, to exist, and it turns out to contain (5.182) as a very central piece.
Basically (5.182) reﬂects the constraints imposed on the system.

Two examples, for which the above term plays a central role, are the cases of a particle
with a ﬁxed spin, and the system of a charged particle in the ﬁeld of a magnetic monopole.
These two problems were treated in great detail in [197].

3.1.3 Quantization of the Symplectic Form on S2

The fuzziﬁcation of the sphere S2 is the procedure of its discretisation by quantization.
The starting point is the Wess-Zumino term (5.182). This same procedure, as will show
in due time, works for all co-adjoint orbits such as CPn. Spacetimes and spatial slices,
which are not co-adjoint orbits, require other procedures for their fuzziﬁcation.

Let us now turn to the quantization of the Lagrangian (5.182). First, we parametrize
the group element g by the set of variables (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3). The conjugate momenta πi are
given by the equations

πi =

∂LWZ
∂ ˙ξi

= ΛiT r(σ3g−1 ∂g

∂ξi ).

(3.22)

ξi and πi will satisfy, as usual, the standard Poisson brackets {ξi, ξj} = {πi, πj} = 0, and
{ξi, πj} = δij.

MFT, Badis Ydri

A change in the local coordinates, ξ−→f (), which is deﬁned by g(f ()) = exp(iiσi/2)g(ξ),

{ti, g−1} = −ig−1 σi

{ti, tj} = ijktk.

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

Putting equation (3.24), in the last equation of (3.25), one can derive the following result
{xi, xj} = Rijkxk/Λ, which is the ﬁrst indication that we are going to get a fuzzy sphere
under quantization. The classical sphere would correspond to Λ−→∞.

However, a more precise treatment, would have to start by viewing equations, (3.24),
as a set of constraints rather than a set of identities on the phase space (ξi, ti). In other
words, the functions Pi = ti − Λni do not vanish identically on the phase space {(ξi, ti)}.
However, their zeros will deﬁne the physical phase space as a submanifold of {(ξi, ti)}. To
see that the Pi’s are not the zero functions on the phase space, one can simply compute
the Poisson brackets {Pi, Pj}. The answer turns out to be {Pi, Pj} = ijk(Pk − Λnk),
which clearly does not vanish on the surface Pi = 0, so the Pi’s should only be set to zero
after the evaluation of all Poisson brackets. This fact will be denoted by setting Pi to be
weakly zero, i.e.

Pi ≈ 0.

(3.26)

Equations (3.26) provide the primary constraints of the system. The secondary constraints
of the system are obtained from the consistency conditions {Pi, H} ≈ 0, where H is
the Hamiltonian of the system. Since H is given by H = viPi where vi are Lagrange
multipliers, the requirement {Pi, H} ≈ 0 will lead to no extra constraints on the system.
It will only put conditions on the v’s [197].

From equations (3.25), it is obvious that ti are generators of the left action of SU (2).

A right action can also be deﬁned by the generators
j = −tiRij(g).
tR

(3.27)
Rij(g) deﬁne the standard SU (2) adjoint representation, viz Rij(g)σi = gσjg−1. These

These constraints are divided into one independent ﬁrst class constraint, and two inde-

pendent second class constraints. tR
by (3.29), one have {tR
i } = 0, for all i. It corresponds to the fact that the Lagrangian
(5.182) is weakly invariant, under the gauge transformations g−→g exp(iσ3θ/2), namely
2 ≈ 0, are second class.
LWZ−→LWZ − Λ ˙θ. The two remaining constraints, tR
1 ≈ 0 and tR
They can be converted to a set of ﬁrst class constraints by taking the complex combi-
2 ≈ 0. We would, then, have {tR
1 ±itR
3 , tR±} = ∓itR±, and therefore all the
nations tR± = tR
Poisson brackets {tR
3 , tR±} vanish on the surface (3.29).

with a scalar product deﬁned by (ψ1, ψ2) =(cid:82)

Let us now construct the physical wave functions of the system described by the
Lagrangian (5.182). One starts with the space F of complex valued functions on SU (2),
SU (2) dµ(g)ψ1(g)∗ψ2(g), where dµ stands for
the Haar measure on SU (2). The physical wave functions are elements of F which are
also subjected to the constraints (3.29). They span a subspace H of F. For Λ < 0, one
must then have

3 ψ = −Λψ
tR
tR
+ψ = 0.

(3.30)
In other words, ψ transforms as the highest weight state of the spin l = |Λ| representation
of the SU (2) group. Thus, |Λ| is quantized to be either an integer or a half integer number,
viz

, N = 1, 2, ...

(3.31)

|Λ| = l =

N − 1

2

l(cid:88)

m=−l

The physical wave functions are, then, linear combinations of the form

ψ(g) =

Cm < lm|Dl(g)|ll > .

(3.32)

The Dl(g) is the spin l = (N − 1)/2 representation of the element g of SU (2).

If Λ was positive the second equation of (3.30) should be replaced by tR−ψ = 0, and as
a consequence, ψ would be the lowest weight state of the spin l = Λ representation of the
SU (2) group.

Clearly the left action of SU (2) on g will rotate the index m in such a way that <
lm|Dl(g)|ll > transforms as a basis for the Hilbert space of the N−dimensional irreducible
representation l = (N − 1)/2 of SU (2). Under the right action of SU (2) on g, the matrix
element < lm|Dl(g)|ll > will, however, transform as the heighest weight state l = |Λ|,
m = |Λ| of SU (2).

In the quantum theory, we associate with the modiﬁed conjugate momenta ti, the

operators Li satisfying

[Li, Lj] = iijkLk , L2

i = l(l + 1).

(3.35)

These are (2l + 1) × (2l + 1) matrices, which furnish, the spin l = (N − 1)/2 irreducible
representation of SU (2). In a sense, the Li’s provide the fuzzy coordinate functions on
the fuzzy sphere S2
N . Fuzzy points are deﬁned by the eigenvalues of the operators Li, and
the fact that these operators can not be diagonalized, simultaneously, is a reﬂection of the
fact that fuzzy points can not be localized.

Observables of the system will be functions of Li, i.e. f (Li) ≡ f (L1, L2, L3). These
functions are the only objects which will have, by construction, weakly zero Poisson brack-
ets with the constraints (3.29). This is because, by deﬁnition, left and right actions of
SU (2) commute. These observables are linear operators which act on the left of ψ(g) by
left translations, namely

The operators f (Li) can be represented by (2l + 1)×(2l + 1) matrices of the form

f (Li) =

αi1,...,ik Li1...Lik .

i1,...,ik

The summations in this equation will clearly terminate because the dimension of the space
of all (2l + 1)×(2l + 1) matrices is ﬁnite equal to (2l + 1)2.

The fuzzy sphere S2

N is, essentially, the algebra A of all operators of the form (3.35).
This is the algebra of N×N Hermitian matrices MatN , viz A = MatN . More precisely, the
fuzzy sphere S2
N is deﬁned by the spectral triple (AL, HL, ∆L), where HL is the Hilbert
space H spanned by the physical wave functions (3.32). We leave the construction of the
Laplacian operator ∆L to the next section.

3.2 Coherent States and Star Product on Fuzzy
S2
N

The sphere is the complex projective space CP1, which is also a co-adjoint orbit. The
quantization of the symplectic form on S2 yields the fuzzy sphere S2
N . In this section,
we will explain this result, one more time, by constructing the coherent states, and star
product on the fuzzy sphere S2
N following [198] and [121]. We will also construct the
correct Laplacian on the fuzzy sphere.

Coherent States: We start with classical S2 deﬁned as the orbit of SU (2) through
the Pauli matrix σ3. This orbit can also be given by the projector

P =

(12 + naσa).

(3.36)

Let us specialize the projector (3.36) to the ”north” pole of S2 given by the point (cid:126)n0 =
(0, 0, 1). We have then the projector P0 = diag(1, 0). So at the ”north” pole, P projects
down onto the state |ψ0 >= (1, 0) of the Hilbert space H (2)
1/2 = C2, on which the deﬁning
representation of SU (2) is acting.
A general point (cid:126)n∈ S2 can be obtained from (cid:126)n0, by the action of an element g∈SU (2),
1/2. One can

as (cid:126)n = R(g)(cid:126)n0. P will then project down onto the state |ψ >= g|ψ0 > of H (2)
show that

P = |ψ >< ψ| = g|ψ0 >< ψ0|g−1 = gP0g−1.

Equivalently

gt3g−1 = nata.

It is obvious that U (1) is the stability group of t3 and hence S2 = SU (2)/U (1). Thus,
points (cid:126)n of S2, are equivalent classes [g] = [gh], h∈U (1).
We will set |ψ0 >= |(cid:126)n0, 1/2 > and |ψ >= |(cid:126)n, 1/2 >. By using the result (3.14), we can

Derivations and Laplacian: The l−representation matrix U (l)(h) can be given by
U (l)(h) = exp(iηaLa). Now if we take η to be small, then, one computes

< (cid:126)n, l|U (l)(h)|(cid:126)n, l >= 1 + iηa < (cid:126)n, l|La|(cid:126)n, l > .

(3.77)

On the other hand, we know that the representation U (l)(h) is obtained by taking the
symmetric tensor product of 2l fundamental representations 2 of SU (2), and hence

(3.79)

From this equation, we see explicitly that La/l are, indeed, the coordinate operators on

We deﬁne derivations by the adjoint action of the group. For example, derivations on
S2 are generated by the vector ﬁelds La = −iabcnb∂c which satisfy [La,Lb] = iabcLc. The

corresponding action on the Hilbert space H (2)

l

< (cid:126)n, l|U (l)(h−1) ˆF U (l)(h)|(cid:126)n, l > = < (cid:126)n, l| ˆF|(cid:126)n, l > −iηa < (cid:126)n, l|[La, ˆF ]|(cid:126)n, l > .(3.80)

Equivalently

< (cid:126)n, l|U (l)(h−1) ˆF U (l)(h)|(cid:126)n, l > = Fl − iηal(na ∗ Fl − Fl ∗ na)
ηa(Kab − Kba)∂bFl

= Fl − i
2
= Fl − iηaLaFl.

(3.81)

Therefore, fuzzy derivations on the fuzzy sphere must, indeed, be given by the commuta-
tors [La, ...], since we have

(LaF )l((cid:126)n) ≡ < (cid:126)n, l|[La, ˆF ]|(cid:126)n, l > .

(3.82)

A natural choice of the Laplacian operator ∆L on the fuzzy sphere, is therefore, given by
the following Casimir operator

∆L = L2

a ≡ [La, [La, ..]].

(3.83)

It is not diﬃcult to show that this Laplacain has a cut-oﬀ spectrum of the form k(k + 1),
where k = 0, 1, ..., 2l. This result will be discussed, much further, in due course.

3.3 The Flattening Limit of R2
θ

In this section, we will discuss a, seemingly, diﬀerent star product on the fuzzy sphere,
which admits a straightforward ﬂattening limit, to the star product on the Moyal-Weyl
plane. We will follow [75].

3.3.1 Fuzzy Stereographic Projection

We have established, in previous sections, that the coordinate operators ˆxa on the
fuzzy sphere are proportional to the generators La, of the group SU (2), in the irreducible
a = l(l + 1), and since we want

representation with spin l = (N − 1)/2. Since (cid:80)
(cid:80)

a L2

a ˆx2

a = R2, we deﬁne the coordinate operators on the fuzzy sphere S2

N by

ˆxa =

RLa√
c2

, c2 = l(l + 1) =

N 2 − 1

4

.

(3.84)

This deﬁnition is slightly diﬀerent from (3.79). Hence, the commutation relations on the
fuzzy sphere read

[ˆxa, ˆxb] =

iR√
c2

abc ˆxc.

(3.85)

MFT, Badis Ydri

We must also have

(cid:88)

a

ˆx2
a = R2.

74

(3.86)

We deﬁne the stereographic projections a and a+, in terms of the operators ˆxa, as follows

where

a =

2

(ˆx1 − iˆx2)b , a+ =

1
2

b(ˆx1 + iˆx2),

b =

R − ˆx3

.

(3.87)

(3.88)

We can compute immediately that [a, b−1] = −αa/2 and [a+, b−1] = αa+/2, where α =
√
c2. Hence we conclude that b−1 commutes with |a|2 = aa+. From
θ2/R, and θ2 = R2/
the other hand, we can show by using Jacobi’s identity that b−1 commutes with [a, a+], and
thus b must also commute with a+a. By using this fact, and also x3 = R− 2b−1, as well as
√
[b, a] = −αbab/2, we obtain the analogue of the commutation relation [ˆx1, ˆx2] = iRˆx3/
c2,
which takes the simpler form

[a, a+] = F (|a|2) , |a|2 = aa+.

(3.99)
This should be compared with |a|2|l, m >= λn−1|l, m >. In other words, we identify the
ﬁrst N states |n >, in the inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator,
with the states |l, m > of HN , via

|l, m > ↔|n − 1 > , n = l + m + 1.

3.3.2 Coherent States and Planar Limit
Coherent States: The coherent states |z; N >, associated with the deformed har-
monic oscillator creation and annihilation operators a and a+ in the limit N −→ ∞, are
constructed in [199]. For large but ﬁnite N , they are deﬁned by the equation [75]

In the above equation [fN (n)]! = fN (0)fN (1)...fN (n − 1)fN (n). These states are normal-
ized, viz

N−1(cid:88)

n=0

< z; N|z; N > = 1 ↔ MN (x) =

n!([fN (n)]!)2 .

(3.105)

These states satisfy

zN

1)/4(N − 1)), and(cid:112)(N − 1)![fN (N − 1)]!−→√

In the large N limit, we can check, see below, that MN (x)−→(N − 1)(1 + x)N−2 exp((x +
π, and hence a|z; N > −→z|z; N >, which
means that |z; N > becomes exactly an a−eigenstate. Indeed, in this limit we have

|N − 1 > .

These are the states constructed in [199].

As it is the case with standard coherent states, the above states |z; N > are not

orthonormal, since

Using this result, as well as the completeness relation (cid:82) dµN (z, ¯z)|z; N >< z; N| = 1,

< z1; N|z2; N >= MN (|z1|2)− 1

2 MN (|z2|2)− 1

(3.108)

where dµN (z, ¯z) is the corresponding measure, we can deduce the identity

(cid:90)

MN (1) =

dµN (z, ¯z)

MN (z)MN (¯z)

MN (|z|2)

.

This last equation allows us to determine that the measure dµ(z, ¯z) is given by

dµN (z, ¯z) = iMN (|z|2)XN (|z|2)dz∧d¯z = 2MN (r2)XN (r2)rdrdθ.

For large N , where |z|2 << N , we have the behavior

XN (x) =

The behavior of the measure dµN (z, ¯z) coincides, therefore, with the ordinary measure on
S2, viz

dµN (z, ¯z)(cid:39) N − 1

idz∧d¯z

(3.117)

This shows explicitly that the coherent states |z; N > correspond, indeed, to the coherent
states on the fuzzy sphere, and that the limit N −→ ∞ corresponds to the commutative
limit of the fuzzy sphere.

We can associate to every operator O a function ON (z, ¯z) by setting < z; N|O|z; N >=
ON (z, ¯z). It is therefore clear that the trace of the operator O is mapped to the inetgral
of the function ON , i.e.

TrO =

dµN (z, ¯z)ON (z, ¯z).

The Planar Limit: Finally we comment on the planar, or ﬂattening, limit of the
above star product which is, in fact, the central point of our discussion here. We are
interested in the double scaling limit

N −→ ∞ , R −→ ∞ , θ2 =

(3.122)
In this limit, we also set ˆx3 = −R, where the minus sign is due to our deﬁnition of the
stereographic coordinate b in (3.88). The stereographic coordinates b, a and a+ are scaled
in this limit as

ˆa+ , ˆa = ˆx1 − iˆx2 , ˆa+ = ˆx1 + iˆx2.

(3.123)

This scaling means, in particular, that the coordinates z and ¯z must scale as z = ˆz/2R and
¯z = ¯ˆz/2R. From (3.95), which holds in the large N limit, we can immediately conclude
that [ˆa, ˆa+] = 2θ2 in this limit, or equivalently

[ˆx1, ˆx2] = −iθ2.

(3.124)
Next, from the result MN (x)−→(N − 1)(1 + x)N−2, when N−→∞, we can conclude that,
in the above double scaling limit, we must have
MN (|z|2)−→N e

The measure dµN (z, ¯z) behaves in this limit as

3.4 The Fuzzy Sphere: A Summary
The Commutative Sphere: The round unit sphere can be deﬁned as the 2−dimensional
surface embedded in ﬂat 3−dimensional space with global coordinates na satisfying the
a = 1. The rotation generators La = −iabcnb∂c deﬁne global derivations
The continuum sphere is the spectral triple (A,H, ∆) where A = C∞(S2) is the algebra
of smooth bounded functions on the sphere, ∆ = LaLa is the Laplacian on the sphere,
and H = L2(S2) is the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the sphere. The
Laplacian is given explicitly by

(3.144)

The eigenfunctions of this Laplacian are the spherical harmonics Ylm(θ, φ) with l =
0, 1, 2, ... and m = −l, ..., +l, viz

∆Ylm(θ, φ) = l(l + 1)Ylm(θ, φ) , l = 0, 1, 2, ....

(3.145)

L3Ylm(θ, φ) = mYlm(θ, φ) , m = −l, ..., +l.

(3.146)

The spherical harmonics form a complete set of orthonormal functions. The orthonormal-
ization condition reads (with dΩ being the solid angle on the sphere)

Thus, a smooth and bounded function on the sphere, i.e. a function where the set of its
values is bounded, can be expanded as a linear combination of the spherical harmonics,
namely

sphere, is the space of all functions on the sphere with inner product

(f, g) =

f∗(θ, φ)g(θ, φ).

The Fuzzy Sphere: The fuzzy sphere was originally conceived in [200, 201]. It can
be viewed as a particular deformation of the above triple which is based on the fact that
the sphere is the coadjoint orbit SU (2)/U (1), viz

gσ3g−1 = naσa , g∈SU (2) , (cid:126)n∈S2,

(3.152)

and is therefore a symplectic manifold which can be quantized in a canonical fashion by
quantizing the volume form

ω = sin θdθ∧dφ =

abcnadnb∧dnc.

2

(3.153)

The result is the spectral triple (AL, HL, ∆L) where AL = MatN , with N = L + 1, is the
algebra of N × N Hermitian matrices. MatN becomes the N 2−dimensional Hilbert space
structure HL when supplied with the inner product

( ˆF , ˆG) =

T r( ˆF + ˆG) , ˆF , ˆG∈MatN .

(3.154)
The spin l = L/2 = (N − 1)/2 irreducible representation of SU (2) has both a left and
a right action on the Hilbert space HL generated by La and LR
a respectively. The right
generators are obviously deﬁned by LR
a

ˆF = La ˆF , ˆF ∈ MatN . These generators satisfy

It is obvious that elements of the matrix algebra MatN will play the role of functions on
the fuzzy sphere S2
N , while derivations are inner and given by the generators of the adjoint
action of SU (2) deﬁned by

ˆLa ˆF = (La − LR

a ) ˆF = [La, ˆF ].

(3.157)

A natural choice of the Laplacian on the fuzzy sphere is therefore given by the Casimir
operator

∆L = ˆLa ˆLa

= [La, [La, ..]].

(3.158)

Thus, the algebra of matrices MatN decomposes under the action of SU (2) as the tensor
product of two SU (2) irreducible representations with spin l = L/2, viz

We have then the following fundamental result: The Laplacian ∆L = (La − LR

a )2 has
a cut-oﬀ spectrum with eigenvalues l(l + 1), where l = 0, 1, ..., L, and eigenmatrices ˆYlm,
i.e.

∆L ˆYlm = l(l + 1) ˆYlm , l = 0, 1, ..., L.

The polarization tensors are deﬁned by [178]

[La, [La, ˆYlm]] = l(l + 1) ˆYlm,

[L±, ˆYlm] =(cid:112)(l∓m)(l±m + 1) ˆYlm±1 , [L3, ˆYlm] = m ˆYlm.

N is N 2 and the noncommutativity parameter is θ = 1/

Coherent States and Star Product: The fuzzy sphere as the spectral triple
(MatN , HN , ∆N ) is isomorphic to the spectral triple (C∞(S2),H,L2)∗ which corresponds
to the algebra on the commutative sphere with the ordinary pointwise multiplication of
functions replaced by the star product on the fuzzy sphere. This isomorphism, i.e.
in-
vertible map between matrices and functions, can be given in terms of coherent states or
equivalently the Weyl map.

Let H (2)

l = CN be the Hilbert space associated with the irreducible representation of
SU (2) with spin l = L/2 = (N − 1)/2. We may make the identiﬁcation H (2)
l = HN . The
representation of the group element g ∈ SU (2) is given by U (l)(g). The matrix elements
of the operators U (l)(g) are precisely the Wigner functions

The projector Pl onto the coherent state |(cid:126)n, l > is given by

Pl = |(cid:126)n, l >< (cid:126)n, l|

= U (l)(g)P0lU (l)(g+).

(3.174)
The projector P0l = |(cid:126)n0, l >< (cid:126)n0, l| = |l, l >< l, l| is clearly given, in the basis |lm >,
by P0l = diag(1, 0, ..., 0). Under g −→ gh where h ∈ U (1), i.e. h = exp(iθt3), we
have U (l)(g) −→ U (l)(g)U (l)(h) where U (l)(h) = exp(iθL3).
It is then obvious that
U (l)(h)P0lU (l)(h+) = P0l which means that the coherent state |(cid:126)n, l > is associated with
the equivalent class (cid:126)n = [gh].
By using the coherent states |(cid:126)n, l >, we can associate to each matrix ˆF ∈ MatN a

function Fl ∈ C∞(S2) by the formula

Fl((cid:126)n) = T rPl ˆF

= < (cid:126)n, l| ˆF|(cid:126)n, l > .

(3.175)

For example, the operators La are mapped under this map to the coordinates lna, viz

< (cid:126)n, l|La|(cid:126)n, l >= lna.

(3.176)

Hence we can indeed identify ˆxa = La/l with the coordinate operators on the fuzzy sphere
S2
N . This relation can be generalized to a map between higher spherical harmonics and
higher polarization tensors given by

< (cid:126)n, l| ˆYlm|(cid:126)n, l >= Ylm((cid:126)n).

(3.177)

Thus we may think of the polarization tensors as fuzzy spherical harmonics. The function
Fl and the matrix ˆF can then be expanded as

Fl =

clmYlm , ˆF =

clm ˆYlm.

3.5 Fuzzy Fields and Actions

3.5.1 Scalar Action on S2
N

A real scalar ﬁeld ˆΦ on the fuzzy sphere is an element of the matrix algebra MatN .
The Laplacian on the fuzzy sphere provides a kinetic term for the scalar ﬁeld ˆΦ, while a
mass term is obtained by squaring the matrix ˆΦ, and the interaction is given by a higher

for us, is given explicitly by

ture on the classical 4−sphere S2 × S2 by treating it as the co-adjoint orbit SU (2)/U (1)×
SU (2)/U (1). The L(a)

In fact, it is enough to set la = lb = l and Ra = Rb = R as this corresponds in the
limit to a noncommutative R4 with an Euclidean metric R2×R2. The general case simply
corresponds to diﬀerent deformation parameters in the two R2 factors and the extension
of all results is thus obvious.

In close analogy with the case of a single sphere, and by putting together the above

ingredients, the action on the fuzzy 4−sphere S2

N × S2

N is given by

We will mostly restrict ourselves to quartic interactions, viz V ( ˆΦ) = λ ˆΦ4/4!. We have
explicitly introduced factors of R wherever necessary to sharpen the analogy with ﬂat-
space ﬁeld theories. For example, the integrand R4dΩ1dΩ2 has canonical dimension of
(Length)4 like d4x, the ﬁeld has dimension (Length)(−1), µ has (Length)(−1) and λ is
dimensionless.

Again by analogy with the case of a single sphere, the scalar ﬁeld/matrix ˆΦ can be

expanded in terms of polarization operators [178] as

ˆΦ = (2l + 1)

φk1m1p1n1Tk1m1(l)⊗Tp1n1(l).

Therefore the ﬁeld ˆΦ has a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom totaling to (2l1 + 1)2(2l2 +
2)2. The Tkm(l) are the polarization tensors which satisfy

(cid:112)k1(k1 + 1) − m1(m1±1)Tk1m1±1(l),

and the identities

TrHTk1m1(l)Tp1n1(l) = (−1)m1δk1p1δm1+n1,0, T +

k1m1

(l) = (−1)m1Tk1−m1(l).

Our interest is restricted to hermitian ﬁelds since they are the analog of real ﬁelds in the
continuum. Imposing hermiticity, i.e. ˆΦ+ = ˆΦ, we obtain the conditions

Since the ﬁeld on a fuzzy space has only a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, the simplest

Introducing Fuzzy CP2

In this section we will give the K-cycle associated with the classical K¨ahler manifold
CP2 (which is also the co-adjoint orbit SU (3)/U (2)) as a limit of the K-cycle which
deﬁnes fuzzy (or quantized) CP2 when the noncommutativity parameter goes to 0. We
will follow the construction of [121].

Let Ta, a = 1, ..., 8 be the generators of SU (3) in the symmetric irreducible represen-

tation (n, 0) of dimension N = 1

2 (n + 1)(n + 2). They satisfy

[Ta, Tb] = ifabcTc .

(3.202)

Let ta = λa/2 (where λa are the usual Gell-Mann matrices) be the generators of SU (3)
in the fundamental representation (1, 0) of dimension N = 3. They satisfy

2tatb =

1
3

δab + (dabc + ifabc)tc

tr3tatb =

(3.203)
The N−dimensonal generator Ta can be obtained by taking the symmetric product of n
copies of the fundamental 3−dimensional generator ta, viz

δab , tr3tatbtc =

(dabc + ifabc).

Ta = (ta⊗1⊗...⊗1 + 1⊗ta⊗...⊗1 + ... + 1⊗1⊗...⊗ta)symmetric.

(3.204)
In the continuum CP2 is the space of all unit vectors |ψ > in C3 modulo the phase. Thus
eiθ|ψ >, for all θ∈[0, 2π[ deﬁne the same point on CP2. It is obvious that all these vectors
eiθ|ψ > correspond to the same projector P = |ψ >< ψ|. Hence CP2 is the space of all
projection operators of rank one on C3. Let HN and H3 be the Hilbert spaces of the

MFT, Badis Ydri

89

SU (3) representations (n, 0) and (1, 0) respectively. We will deﬁne fuzzy CP2 through
the canonical SU (3) coherent states as follows. Let (cid:126)n be a vector in R8, then we deﬁne
the projector

P3 =

3

(3.205)

The requirement P 2
equations

3 = P3 leads to the condition that (cid:126)n is a point on CP2 satisfying the

[na, nb] = 0 , n2

a =

3

, dabcnanb =

3

nc.

(3.206)

We can write

P3 = |(cid:126)n, 3 >< 3, (cid:126)n|.

(3.207)
We think of |(cid:126)n, 3 > as the coherent state in H3 (level 3× 3 matrices) which is localized at
the point (cid:126)n of CP2. Therefore the coherent state |(cid:126)n, N > in HN (level N × N matrices)
which is localized around the point (cid:126)n of CP2 is deﬁned by the projector

PN = |(cid:126)n, N >< N, (cid:126)n| = (P3⊗P3⊗...⊗P3)symmetric.

(3.208)

We compute that

tr3taP3 =< (cid:126)n, 3|ta|(cid:126)n, 3 >=

The algebra of functions on fuzzy CP2

Therefore in the large N limit we can see that the algebra of xa reduces to the continuum
algebra of na. Hence xa−→na in the continuum limit N−→∞.
N is identiﬁed with the algebra of N×N matrices
M atN generated by all polynomials in the coordinates operators xa. Recall that N =
1
2 (n + 1)(n + 2). The left action of SU (3) on this algebra is generated by (n, 0) whereas
the right action is generated by (0, n). Thus the algebra M atN decomposes under the
action of SU (3) as

(n, 0)⊗(0, n) = ⊗n

p=0(p, p).

(3.212)

A general function on fuzzy CP2

N is therefore written as

F =

(3.213)

The T (p,p)

I 2, I3 and Y are the square of the isospin, the third component of the isospin and the
hypercharge quantum numbers which characterize SU (3) representations.

(3.215)

Furthermore we can compute

It is a known result that the Dirac operator in arbitrary coordinates on a manifold M

is given by [4]

D = iγµ(∂µ +

8

ωµab[γa, γb]).

(3.219)

MFT, Badis Ydri

91

µeb

µeb

The γµ are the generators of the curved Cliﬀord algebra, namely {γµ, γν} = 2gµν with
γµ2 = 1 and γµ+ = γµ. The γa are the generators of the ﬂat Cliﬀord algebra which are
deﬁned as follows. First one decomposes the metric gµν into tetrads, viz gµν = ηabea
ν and
ν where ηab is the ﬂat metric δab. The generators γa of the ﬂat Cliﬀord algebra
ηab = gµνea
are then deﬁned by γµ = γaEµ
ν. This
Eµ
a satisﬁes therefore the following equations Eµ
µ is
the matrix which transforms the coordinate basis dxµ of the cotangent bundle T ∗
x (M ) to
a is the matrix transforming the basis ∂/∂xµ
the orthonormal basis ea = ea
of the tangent bundle Tx(M ) to the orthonormal basis Ea = Eµ

a = ηabgµνeb

The ωµab in the above equations is the aﬃne spin connection one-form. All the diﬀerential
geometry of the manifold M is completely coded in the two following tensors. The curva-
b and the torsion two form-tensor T a. They are given by Cartan’s

b means ωa

bµdxµ. The Levi-Civita connection or Christoﬀel symbol Γµ

The ωa
αβ on
the manifold M is determined by the two following conditions. First, one must require
that the metric is covariantly constant, namely gµν;α = ∂αgµν − Γλ
αµgλν − Γλ
ανgµλ = 0.
αβ − Γµ
Secondly, one requires that there is no torsion , i.e T µ
2 (Γµ
βα) = 0. The Levi-
2 gµν(∂αgνβ + ∂βgνα − ∂νgαβ).
Civita connection is then uniquely determined to be Γµ
In the same way the Levi-Civita spin connection is obtained by restricting the aﬃne spin
connection ωab to satisfy the metricity and the no-torsion conditions respectively

αβ = 1
αβ = 1

ωab + ωba = 0 , dea + ωa

b∧eb = 0.

(3.222)

The Levi-Civita spin connection on S2 with metric ds2 = ρ2dθ2 + ρ2sin2θdφ2 is given by

ω21 = cosθdφ.

(3.223)

From the other hand, the Levi-Civita spin connection on R3 with metric ds2 = dr2 +
r2dθ2 + r2sin2θdφ2 is given by

ω21 = cosθdφ , ω23 = sinθdφω13 = dθ.

(3.224)

Now we are in the position to calculate the Dirac operators on the sphere S2 and on R3.
On the sphere we obtain

(3.226)

(3.227)

This equation will always be our guiding rule for ﬁnding the Dirac operator on S2 starting
from the Dirac operator on R3 . However, there is an inﬁnite number of Dirac operators
on S2 which are all related by U (1) rotations and therefore they are all equivalent. The
generator of these rotations is given by the chirality operator γ on the sphere which is
deﬁned by

γ = (cid:126)σ.(cid:126)n = γ+; γ2 = 1; γD2θ + D2θγ = 0, (cid:126)n =

(3.228)
D2θ is the Dirac operator on the sphere which is obtained from a reference Dirac operator

(3.229)
Next we ﬁnd algebraic global expressions of the Dirac operator D2 with no reference to
any local coordinates on the sphere S2. There are two diﬀerent methods to do this which
lead to two Dirac operators on the sphere denoted by D2g and D2w. The operator D2g
stands for the Dirac operator due to [1–3], whereas D2w stands for the Dirac operator due
to [223, 224]. On the continuum sphere these two Dirac operators are equivalent while
on the fuzzy sphere these operators become diﬀerent. We start with the standard Dirac
operator on R3, viz

D3 = iσi∂i.

(3.230)

The σi are the Pauli matrices. Now deﬁning γ = (cid:126)σ.(cid:126)x
rewrite D3 as

r and the identity γ2 = 1 we can

D3 = γ2D3 = (

The two Dirac operators (3.234) and (3.237) are clearly equivalent because one can
show that both operators have the same spectrum. This can be seen from the fact that

3.7.2 Fuzzy Dirac Operators

(3.238)

(3.239)

(3.240)

There is a major problem associated with conventional lattice approaches to the non-
perturbative formulation of chiral gauge theories with roots in topological features. The
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [9, 222] states that
if we want to maintain chiral symmetry
then one cannot avoid the doubling of fermions in the usual lattice formulations. We will

MFT, Badis Ydri

94

show that this problem is absent on the fuzzy sphere and as consequence it will also be
absent on fuzzy S2 × S2. It does not arise on fuzzy CP2 as well.

We can show that in the continuum, the spinors ψ belong to the ﬁber H2 of the spinor
bundle E2 over the sphere. H2 is essentially a left A−module, in other words, if f∈A and
ψ∈H2 then f ψ∈H2. Recall that A = C∞(S2). H2 can also be thought of as the vector
space H2 = A⊗C2. The noncommutative analogue of the projective module H2 is the
projective module H2 = A⊗C2 where A = M atL+1. This is clearly an A−bimodule since
there is a left action as well as a right action on the space of spinors H2 by the elements
of the algebra A. The left action is generated by LL
i = Li whereas the right action will be
generated by LR
j ] = iijkLL
k
j ] = −iijkLR
and [LR
k . Derivations on the fuzzy sphere are given by the commutators
i − LR
by Li = [Li, ..] = LL
i .

i f = f Li for any f ∈ A. We also have [LL

i deﬁned by LR

i , LR

i , LL

The fuzzy Dirac operators and the fuzzy chirality operators must be deﬁned in such
a way that they act on the Hilbert space H2. The Dirac operators must anticommute
with the fuzzy chirality operators. They must be selfadjoint and reproduce the continuum
operators in the limit L−→∞.

To get the discrete version of γ = σana one ﬁrst simply replaces na by xa to get σaxa.

We can check that this operator does not square to 1. Indeed, we can check that

(cid:0)(cid:126)σ.(cid:126)L +

(cid:1)2 = 1.

2

( L

(3.241)

(3.242)

In other words, the chirality operator in the discrete is given by

ΓL =

1

L

2 + 1

2

((cid:126)σ.(cid:126)L +

2

).

By construction this operator has the correct continuum limit and it squares to one.
However, by inspection ΓL does not commute with functions on S2
L. The property that
the chirality operator must commute with the elements of the algebra is a fundamental
requirement of the K-cycle (A, H, D, Γ) desribing S2
L. To overcome this problem one
simply replace (cid:126)L by −(cid:126)LR. Since these generators act on the right of the algebra A , they
will commute with anything which act on the left and therefore the chirality operator will
commute with the algebra elements as desired. The fuzzy chirality operator is then given
by the formula

The fuzzy version of the Grosse-Klimˇc´ık-Preˇsnajder Dirac operator deﬁned by equation
(3.234) is simply given by

D2g =

1
R

((cid:126)σ.(cid:126)L − (cid:126)σ.(cid:126)LR + 1).

(3.248)

This Dirac operator does not anticommute with the chirality operator (3.243) and there-
fore it is no longer unitarily equivalent to D2w. Indeed, the two operators D2g and D2w
will not have the same spectrum.
Let us start ﬁrst with D2w. To ﬁnd the spectrum of D2w one simply rewrites the square
D2
2w in terms of the two SU (2) Casimirs (cid:126)J 2 and (cid:126)K2 where (cid:126)J and (cid:126)L are deﬁned by

, (cid:126)L = (cid:126)L − (cid:126)LR.

The eigenvalue j takes the two values j = l + 1
l = 0, 1, ..., L. The eigenvalues of the above squared Dirac operator will then read

The computation of the spectrum of the Dirac operator D2g is much easier. It turns out
that the spectrum of D2g is exactly equal to the spectrum of the continuum Dirac operator
upto the eigenvalue j = L− 1
2 . Thus D2g is a better approximation to the continuum than
D2w and there is no fermion doubling. This can be seen from the equation

2 . The top eigenvalues j = L + 1

By inspection one can immediately notice that there is a problem with the top modes
2 in the spectrum of D2g are not paired to any
j = L + 1
other eigenvalues which is the reason why D2g does not have a chirality operator. Indeed
D2g does not anticommute with ΓR. We ﬁnd
D2gΓR + ΓRD2g =

(3.255)

2R

D2
2g.

L + 1

This equation follows from the fact that

D2g =

L + 1

2R

(ΓL + ΓR).

(3.256)

The Dirac operator D2w vanishes on the top modes j = L + 1
2 and therefore the existence
of these modes spoils the invertibility of the Dirac operator D2w. The Dirac operator D2w
has the extra disadvantage of having a very diﬀerent spectrum compared to the continuum.
In other words D2g is a much better Dirac operator than D2w if one can deﬁne for it a
chirality operator. Towards this end we note the following identity

(cid:115)

[D2g, ΓR] = 2 i

1 −

1

(L + 1)2 D2w.

(3.257)

This leads to the crucial observation that the two operators D2g and D2g anticommute,
viz

D2gD2w + D2wD2g = 0.

(3.258)

If we restrict ourselves to the subspace with j≤L− 1
operator. Let us then deﬁne the projector P by

2 then clearly D2g must have a chirality

P|L +

1
2

, j3 >= 0 , P|j, j3 >= |j, j3 > , for all j≤L − 1
2

.

(3.259)

Let us call V the space on which P projects down. The orthogonal space is W . Our aim
is to ﬁnd the chirality operator of the Dirac operator PD2gP . To this end one starts by
making some observations concerning the continuum. From the basic continuum result
D2w = −iγD2g we can trivially prove the identity γ = iF2gF2w where F2g and F2w are

MFT, Badis Ydri

97

D2g
the sign operators of the Dirac operators D2g and D2w respectively deﬁned by F2g =
|D2g|
and F2w = D2w|D2w| . The fuzziﬁcation of these expressions is only possible if one conﬁne
ourselves to the vector space V since on the fuzzy sphere the operator F2w will not exist
on the whole space V ⊕W . Taking all of these matters into considerations one ends up
with the following chirality operator

ΓR(cid:48)

= iF2gF2w.

F2g =

D2g
|D2g| , on V

= 0 , on W.

F2w =

D2w
|D2w| , on V

= 0 , on W.

(3.260)

(3.261)

(3.262)

By construction (3.260) has the correct continuum limit. If it is going to assume the role
of a chirality operator on the fuzzy sphere it must also square to one on V , in other
words one must have on the whole space V ⊕W : (ΓR(cid:48)
)2 = P . It should also be selfadjoint
and should anticommute with the Dirac operator PD2gP . The key requirement for all
of these properties to hold is the identity {F2g,F2w} = 0. This identity follows trivially
from the result (3.258). It is an interesting fact that the three operators F2g, F2w and
ΓR(cid:48)

constitute a Cliﬀord algebra on V .
Thus, we have established that fermions can be deﬁned on S2

L with no fermion doubling

at least in the absence of fuzzy monopoles. It is however easy to include them as well.

After quantization we get the 2−point function

A self-consistent Hartree treatment means that we replace the free 2−point function with
the full 2−point function and thus it leads to the result

Assuming a cutoﬀ regularization the renormalized mass is deﬁned as usual by absorbing
into µ2 the divergence coming from the momentum integral. Since the noncommutativity
does not modify the large k behaviour we must still have Γ(2)(k) ∼ k2 for k2 −→ ∞ and
therefore the momentum integral is proportional to Λd−2. The renormalized mass will be

(4.45)

The ﬁrst identity means that noncommutativity does not alter the large p behaviour. The
second identity means that the small momentum modes of the ﬁeld Φ can not condense
and as a consequence the ordered phase will break translational invariance.

we can make the approximation 1 = pc. Since ξ0pc is of order 1 (see below) we can
see that the arctan function is of order 1 = pc and hence this whole term is of order

The background in the ordered phase is assumed to be a stripe which breaks translation
invariance, i.e. a conﬁguration of the form (with x = x1)

Φ0 = A cos pcx.

(4.66)

In general an ordered conﬁguration is only expected to be a periodic function of x with
period T = 2π/pc. However, at small coupling the most importrant conﬁguration is the
above stripe phase. In the above ansatz A is assumed to be small so that perturbation
theory is justiﬁed.

Now we quantize the ﬁeld φ by writing φ = ˜φ + X where X is the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld.

The linear term in X is found to be

the parameter  is positive in the region ∗1 <  < ∗2 which corresponds to the disordered

In a naive one-loop we will not get the term α/
ﬁnd the minima r0 = −2τ and rd = τ . The transition point is therefore at τ∗ = 0 or
equivalently m2∗2 = −2g/θ. The vanishing of the renormalized mass r, i.e. the divergence
of the correlation length, at the transition point indicates a second-order behavior. Cor-

respondingly, Γ(2)(p) becomes negative near p = pc = (cid:112)g/θ, since Γ(2)(pc) = r, which

signals a 2nd order transition to an ordered phase. However, in our case the system avoids
the second-order behaviour by an amount proportional to g7/3. It is also very useful to
compare the second-order behaviour m2∗2 = −2g/θ with the critical point of real quartic
matrix models (see latter). The phenomena of a phase transition of an isotropic system
to a nonuniform phase was in fact realized a long time ago by Brazovkii [126].

Lifshitz point: At θΛ2 = ∞ only the planar graphs survive. This maximally non-
commuting theory has the same critical point µ2∗ and the same transition as the planar
theory (which is deﬁned as the sum over planar diagrams only). The planar theory has
the usual Ising symmetry Φ −→ −Φ and the usual broken symmetry phase which can be
reached by traversing a continuous, i.e. a second-order phase transition at µ2∗. The planar
theory is also the N −→ ∞ of some hermitian matrix model. From this point of view the
second-order transition is seen to be diﬀerent from the standard Ising transition in d < 4,
i.e. it lies in a diﬀerent universality class.

For θΛ2 very large but ﬁnite we have instead a ﬁrst-order phase transition since we
have found a non-zero latent heat. The calculation was done near the massless Gaussian
theory where both g and m2 scale to zero with powers of 1/θ. For large g more complicated
patterns become favored over stripes.

For θΛ2 suﬃciently small we get the standard Ising critical point in d≥4. Clearly for
θΛ2 = 0 the minimum of Γ(2)(p) is at p = 0. This remains the minimum for suﬃciently
small θΛ2. The transition is therefore second-order to the usual uniform phase of the Ising
model in d≥4 in which the symmetry Φ −→ −Φ will be broken. There is a critical value

MFT, Badis Ydri

112

(θΛ2)∗ ∼ 1/g where the minimum starts to move away from p = 0. The second-order line
will therefore meet with the ﬁrst-order line which was computed for large θΛ2 at a triple
point (Lifshitz point). The triple point is located at µ2 = −∞ in our current self-consistent
treatment of the one-loop theory. This is however only an artifact of this approximation,
i.e. a ﬁnite triple point is actually more than expected and as a consequence a transition
from the stripe phase to the uniform phase exists. The phase diagram is displayed on
ﬁgure (4.2).

In 3 dimensions there is a transition to a stripe phase. In this case the transition is
made ﬁrst order only by logarithmic divergences. The stripe phase in this case is stable
under infrared ﬂuctuations.

In 2 dimensions it is claimed that the stipe phase is unstable (long range order is
impossible) due to infrared ﬂuctuations. This is thought to be a consequence of the
Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem which states that a continuous symmetry (in this case
translation invariance) can not be spontaneously broken in 2 dimensions. Indeed, if such
a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred then the corresponding massless Goldstone
bosons would have an infrared divergent 2−point correlation function. As we will show
this expectation is not correct as the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem does not really
apply since the conditions on which it is based do not generally hold in noncommutative
ﬁeld theory.

otherwise there will be no solution and hence no transition to a stripe phase. Thus a
stripe phase can exist only for values of the coupling constant such that

g2 >

.

(4.151)

Since g2 is small we conclude that the weak coupling expansion will only make sense for
suﬃciently large values of the noncommutativity. The stripe phase does not exist for
small θ which is very reasonable and since it exists for large θ we suspect that this phase
is related, or even is the same, as the matrix model transition since in the limit θ −→ ∞
we obtain a matrix model from noncommutative Φ4.

4.3 The Self-Dual Noncommutative Phi-Four

4.3.1 Integrability and Exact Solution

The self-dual noncommutative phi-four is obtained by setting Ω2 = 1 or equivalently

Bθ0 = Bθ/2 = 1 and thus α = 2 and β = 0 in (2.232). We get immediately

The matrix E is deﬁned by

(4.195)

A regularized theory is obtained by restricting the Landau quantum numbers l, n to l, n =
1, 2, ..N . We also introduce the cutoﬀ

Λ2 =

.

(4.196)

Let us remark that Λ2 is essentially the energy of the N th Landau level. Indeed ∆1φN,n =
2(8πΛ2 − 2/θ)φN,n where ∆1 = − ˆD2
i = 4B(ˆa+ˆa + 1/2). This energy remains constant
equal to 16πΛ2 in the limit N, θ −→ ∞ while keeping Λ2 constant.

We are thus led to the following N × N matrix model

The notation X R/X L means that the matrix X acts on the right/left of M , viz X RM =

ZN [E] =

.

(4.201)

The trace T R is N 2−dimensional, i.e. acting in the adjoint representation, as opposed to
the trace T r which is N−dimensional. This is due to the fact that we have left action
(given by ˜E) and right action (given by X R) on M . In the remainder we will concentrate
on the model of [93] given by the values

σ = 1 , ˜σ = 0.

In [93] it was shown that this model is integrable, i.e.
it can be solved at ﬁnite N for
general external matrix E. We will follow [93] closely to derive the exact solution at large
N which is relevant to our original noncommutative phi-four.

Before we continue with this model we comment on a related problem of great interest.
For hermitian ﬁelds Φ+ = Φ we get hermitian matrices M + = M . By gooing through the
same steps we get in this case the partition function

(cid:90)

This is valid for all values of σ and ˜σ. The only diﬀerence with the previous case is the
factor of 1/2 multiplying the determinant contribution.

We go back now to our problem and start by diagonalizing the hermitian N ×N matrix
X by writing the polar decomposition X = U†X0U , X0 = diag(x1, ...., xN ), for unitary
N × N matrices U . The measure becomes

[dX] = [dU ]

determinant deﬁned by

∆N (x) =

1≤l<n≤N

(xl − xn).

(4.206)

The unitary matrix U commutes with the external ﬁeld E becasue U acts on the right
whereas E acts on the left. Thus the integration over U decouples. Also recall that E is
diagonal. We will write (E + m2)ln = elδln where

Let also us note that W (z) is essentially the resolvent function of the matrix X, because
of the identiﬁcation W (z) = iΣ(iz), and thus it can be rewritten in a similar way in terms
of another density of eigenvalues ˆρ(x). Correspondingly, we can use W (z) = iΣ(iz) to
show the perturbative behaviour

W (z) −→ − 1

, z −→ ∞.

(4.222)

Next we can see that equation (4.220) can be solved for the following function Ω(z) deﬁned
by

Ω(z) =

Indeed, equation (4.220) can be rewritten as

Ω(z) = W 2(z) − (

, z ∈ C.

The goal is to ﬁnd W (z). Ω(z) is determined in terms of W (z) while ω(z), or equiva-
lently the density of eigenvalues ρ, is known. From equations (4.221) and (4.223) we can
immediately compute

The functions ω−(z) and Ω−(z) are the singular parts of the functions ω(z) and Ω(z)
respectively. They are related as

Ω−(z) = ω−(z)W (z) , z ∈ [a1, a2].

(4.227)

The functions ω(z) and Ω(z) are analytic everywhere away from their branch cut on [a1, a2]
and hence we can extend the domain of the above constraint to the full real line, viz

Ω−(z) = ω−(z)W (z) , z ∈ R.

(4.228)

MFT, Badis Ydri

126

The continuous part of the functions ω(z) and Ω(z) are deﬁned by

ω+(e) ≡ 1
2

(ω(e + i0) + ω(e − i0)) , Ω+(e) ≡ 1
2

(Ω(e + i0) + Ω(e − i0)).

(4.229)

From equations (4.224) and (4.228) we can derive that Ω+ must satisfy
, z ∈ R.

Ω+(z) = W 2(z) − (

− ω+(z))W (z) − 1

However, from equation (4.224) we can read the continuous part of Ω(z) as follows

Ω+(z) = W 2

+(z) + W 2−(z) − (

− ω+(z))W+(z) + ω−(z)W−(z) − 1

The continuous and singular parts of the function W are W+ and W− respectively whereas
+ + W 2− and 2W+W− re-
the continuous and singular parts of the function W 2 are W 2
spectively. Similarly, the continuous part across the interval [a1, a2] of ω(z)W (z) is
ω+(z)W+(z)+ω−(z)W−(z) whereas the singular part is ω+(z)W−(z)+ω−(z)W+(z). Since
Ω+ is continuous we must conclude from (4.231) and (4.232) the constraints

W−(2W+ − z
g
W− = 0 , z ∈ [a1, a2].

+ ω+) = 0 , z ∈ R

(4.233)

This means in particular that W− can only be non-zero on an interval [b1, b2] such that
[b1, b2] ∩ [a1, a2] = φ. On this interval we must clearly have ω− = 0 because ω is analytic
away from [a1, a2] and hence we must have

W+ =

(4.234)

Let us say that the singular part of Ω(z) from (4.224) is given by

Ω−(z) = 2W+(z)W−(z) − (

− ω+(z))W−(z) + ω−(z)W+(z) , z ∈ [a1, a2].(4.235)

This gives nothing new.

Let us now consider the function 1/(cid:112)(z − b1)(z − b2) over the interval [b1, b2]. By
that the continous part of 1/(cid:112)(z − b1)(z − b2) is 0 while the singular part is given by
1/i(cid:112)(z − b1)(z − b2). The square root
(cid:19)

choosing a contour which is a large circle which encloses the interval [b1, b2] we can show
z − b2 changes sign when we go around b2 with

a full circle. Hence we can immediately write (4.235) as a Riemann-Hilbert equation

Recall that [a1, a2] is the support of the external density of eigenvalues and therefore it
is known whereas [b1, b2] is the support of the quantum density of eigenvalues which we
seek.

Two examples/applications are now in order:

The pure quartic matrix model:

In this case we have e = m21 and thus we obtain

(4.245)

In above e = m2 and d = 2 since the density of eigenvalues is a delta function. We write

(4.254)
The ﬁrst equation is equivalent to d ≤ 2 whereas the second equation is equivalent to
m4≥2dg. These together with m4≥4g we conclude that we must have

d≤2 , m4≥4g.

(4.255)

Since in this case the density of eigenvalues is a delta function we have d = 2 and hence
the ﬁrst constraint trivially holds.

The eignvalues l = 1, ..., N correspond to the interval e = 16πl/N + m2 ∈ [m2, 16π + m2].

4.3.2 Nonperturbative UV-IR Mixing

By plugging equation (4.218) into equation (4.217) we obtain the following two-point

(4.264)
We want to compute this two-point function in the limit N −→ ∞, k −→ ∞ with
k/N ∈ [0, 1] kept ﬁxed. In this limit the function W (ek), which should be identiﬁed with
the derivative of the free energy with respect to the eigenvalue λk = ek = 16πk/N + m2,
is given precisely by equation (4.263). The sum over the Landau wavefunctions γk(x, y)
can be computed using the techniques developed in appendix A. In the large k limit we
can evaluate the integral involved in γk(x, y) using the saddle-point approximation to ﬁnd
the result [93]

(cid:113)

γk(x, y) = 4J0(Λ

Thus the large θ limit deﬁned as above gives a rotationally and translationally invariant
quantum noncommutative ﬁeld theory. The Fourier transform of the exact propagator of
the quantum noncommutative ﬁeld theory is essentially given by the exact solution W of
the matrix model Schwinger-Dyson equation, viz

˜G(p) = − 1

(4.269)
Now we take the limit Λ −→ ∞. Towards this end, we will compute the loop expansion
of the above equation. We start by writing

Λ2 W (p2/Λ2 + m2).

The ﬁrst term is due to the one-loop planar tadpole diagram which is logarithmically
divergent in two dimensions whereas the second term is due to the one-loop non-planar
diagram which is quadratically divergent in two dimensions. The two-loop correction
as well as higher order loop corrections can be computed in the same way by means of
equations (4.272).
It will be seen, in particular, that divergences become worse as we
increase the loop order together with the appearance of some additional divergences in
Λ not found in the ordinary scalar ﬁeld and which can be traced to divergences in the
summations over Landau levels in the matrix model.

4.4 Noncommutative Phi-Four on the Fuzzy Sphere

Quantum ﬁeld theories on the fuzzy sphere were proposed originally in [171, 172].
In
perturbation theory of the matrix model (4.275) only the tadpole diagram can diverge in
the limit N −→ ∞ [173, 174]. See also [176, 177]. On the fuzzy sphere the planar and
non-planar tadpole graphs are diﬀerent and their diﬀerence is ﬁnite in the limit. This
is the UV-IR mixing. This problem can be removed by standard normal ordering of the
interaction [175].

Another remarkable limit of the matrix action (4.275) is the limit of the noncommu-
tative Moyal-Weyl plane. This planar limit is deﬁned by N −→ ∞, R −→ ∞ (the radius
√
of the sphere) keeping the ratio R2/
c2 = θ2 ﬁxed. The parameter θ is the noncom-
mutativity parameter and c2 is the Casimir c2 = (N 2 − 1/)4. The coordinates on the
c2 with commutation relations [xa, xb] = iθ2abcxc/R. In
fuzzy sphere are xa = RLa/
the above planar limit restricting also to the north pole on the sphere we have x3 = R and
the commutation relations become [xi, xj] = iθ2ij. These are the commutation relations
on the plane. In this planr limit the matrix action becomes therefore

(4.277)

In the above equation we have also made the replacement R2T r/N = θ2T r/2 with θ2T rθ/2
where T rθ is an inﬁnite dimensional trace and Φ is an inﬁnite dimensional matrix (oper-
ator) on the corresponding Hilbert space. We have also the identiﬁcation m2
θ = m2/R2
and λθ = λ/R2.

We write the above action as

S =

(4.278)

To quantize this model we write Φ = Φ0 + Φ1 where Φ0 is a background ﬁeld which satisfy
the classical equation of motion and Φ1 is a ﬂuctuation. We compute

S[Φ] = S[Φ0] + T rΦ1

The eigenbasis {Tkk3} is such ∆Tkk3 = ∆(k)Tkk3 where ∆(k) = k(k+1). The matrices Tkk3

are the polarization tensors where k = 0, 1, 2, .., N−1 and −k≤k3≤k, viz Tkk3 = ˆYkk3/
N .
Thus while the trace T r is N dimensional the trace T R is actually N 2 dimensional. We
will also need the resolution of the N 2−dimensional identity matrix

In above we have clearly expanded the matrix Φ0 as Φ0 =(cid:80)

φ(kk3)Tkk3. Since Φ0 is
a matrix we can not move it across the polorization tensors and hence the contributions
are diﬀerent. These contributions are ﬁnite by construction. Formally they become equal
in the continuum limit. However, by doing the sums ﬁrst then taking the limit we see
immediately that they are diﬀerent even in the continuum limit. This is the source of the
so-called UV-IR mixing. We show this point next. We have the identities

We can check explicitly that this is indeed the commutative answer. It is ﬁnite. Further-
more it is shown in [175] that all other contributions become equal in the continuum large
N limit to the above commutative result. Hence there is no diﬀerence between planar and
non-planar graphs and the UV-IR mixing is absent in this case.

Hence to remove the UV-IR mixing from this model a standard prescription of normal
ordering which amounts to the substraction of tadpoloe contributions will be suﬃcient.
We consider therefore the action

The ﬁrst substraction is the usual tadpole substraction which renders the limiting com-
mutative theory ﬁnite. The second substraction is to cancel the UV-IR mixing. Although
this action does not have the correct continuum limit (due to the non-local substraction)
the corresponding quantum theory is standard Φ4 in 2 dimensions.

The minima (solutions of the equation of motion Φ(m2 + 2λΦ2) = 0) are given by the

(cid:114)

Φ =

Γ , ordered/matrix phase.

(4.311)
In above Γ is any Grassmanian element of the form Γ = (1, 1, 1...,−1,−1, ..,−1). The
ﬁrst k elements of the diagonal matrix Γ is +1 and the remaining N − k elements are
−1. The ﬁrst conﬁguration (4.310) is rotationally invariant, hence the name disordered,
whereas the second conﬁguration (4.311) is not rotationally invariant for all Γ (cid:54)= 1. We
have therefore spontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational invariance besides the usual
breaking of the Z2 symmetry Φ −→ −Φ.

In the commutative theory the matrix Γ can only be the idenity function. In this case

we will have an ordered phase characterized by

Φ =

, ordered phase.

(4.312)
This is rotationally invariant and only the discrete Z2 symmetry Φ −→ −Φ can be broken
in the commutative theory. In the noncommutative theory this phase also exists and is
renamed uniform ordered phase, but there is also the possibility that Γ (cid:54)= 1 and hence
we have a diﬀerent phase from the usual uniform ordered phase called the non-uniform
ordered phase or matrix phase.

The existence of the uniform ordered (uniform) and matrix (non-uniform) solutions
means in particular that the parameter m2 must be negative. The disordered phase
appears generally for negative values of the mass parameter such that m2 ≥ m2∗ whereas
the ordered/matrix phase appears for m2 ≤ m2∗. The critical value m2∗, for large values of
λ, agrees with the prediction of the pure potential term (4.309) which has in the quantum
theory a 3rd order phase transition which occurs for negative m2 at m2∗ = −2N

√

λ.

Strictly speaking the uniform ordered phase is not stable in the matrix model (4.309)
and the inclusion of the kinetic term is essential for its generation. However, the above
picture is still expected to hold for the full model (4.275) which is indeed conﬁrmed in
Monte Carlo simulation of the model as we will see.

Let us deﬁne the following order parameters. The total power P and the power in the

zero modes P0 given by

As one can immediately see from these expressions both planar and non-planar graphs are
ﬁnite and well deﬁned for all ﬁnite values of N . A measure for the fuzzy UV-IR mixing is
again given by the diﬀerence between planar and non-planar contributions which can be
deﬁned by the equation

The fact that this diﬀerence is not zero in the continuum limit is what is meant by UV-IR
mixing on fuzzy S2×S2. Equation (4.331) can also be taken as the regularized form of the
UV-IR mixing on R4. Removing the UV cut-oﬀ N−→∞ one can show that this diﬀerence
diverges as N 2, viz

We have assumed that m2 << N . This is worse than what happens in the two-dimensional
case. In here not only that the diﬀerence survives the limit but also it diverges.

We can now state with some detail the continuum limit in which the fuzzy spheres ap-
proach (in a precise sense) the noncommutative planes. We are interested in the canonical
large stereographic projection of the spheres onto planes. A planar limit can be deﬁned
as follows

θ2 =

R2√
c2

= ﬁxed as N, R→∞.

(4.333)

We are now in a position to study what happens to the scalar ﬁeld theory in this limit.
First we match the spectrum of the Laplacian operator on each sphere with the spectrum
of the Laplacian operator on the limiting noncommutative plane as follows

a(a + 1) = R2(cid:126)a2.

(4.334)

The vector (cid:126)a is the two dimensional momentum on the noncommutative plane which
corresponds to the integer a. However, since the range of a’s is from 0 to N − 1 the range
of (cid:126)a2 will be from 0 to 2N Λ2 where Λ = 1/θ. It is not diﬃcult to show that the free action

scales as(cid:88)

The scalar ﬁeld is assumed to have the scaling property φ|(cid:126)a|φa|(cid:126)b|φb = R3φamabmb which
gives it the correct mass dimension of −3. The αa and αb above are the angles of the
two momenta (cid:126)a and (cid:126)b respectively. They are deﬁned by αa = πma/a and αb = πmb/b
and hence they are in the range [−π, π]. The mass parameter M of the planar theory is
deﬁned by M 2 = m2/R2.

With these ingredients, it is not then diﬃcult to see that the ﬂattening limit of the

planar 2−point function (4.329) is given by

following approximation for the 6j-symbols

other words, we can always choose the two-dimensional momentum kµ to lie in the y-
direction, thus making αa the angle between aµ and the x-axis. The same is also true for
the other exponential. We thus obtain the canonical non-planar 2-point function on the
noncommutative R4 (with Euclidean metric R2 × R2). Again by rotational invariance,

The action S0 is what we want at the end. The action S1 is the Langmann-Szabo-
Zarembo action, which is exactly solvable, and S2 is the Grosse-Wulkenhaar action which
is renormalizable and free from UV-IR mixing. These two last actions should be compared
with the action on the fuzzy sphere given by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

S = T rN

Φ+∆Φ + V (Φ+, Φ)

, ∆=4BJ 2 = 4BJ (J + 1).

(4.348)

The trace T r on the noncommutative plane is inﬁnite dimensional whereas T rN is ﬁnite
dimensional. In a sense if we cut the trace T r at some ﬁnite value the resulting action S2
is also deﬁning scalar ﬁelds on the sphere with the Laplacian 4B
4 instead of the
usual Laplacian 4BJ 2. This can not be said for S1 since the term J3 in ∆1 breakes the
SU (2) symmetry.

(cid:113)J 2 + 1

Th Action S2 is UV-IR Free: Let us show explicitly that the action S2, regularized
by the fuzzy sphere, is free from UV-IR mixing. We consider real phi-four models given
by

˜b2 = −˜b1 − 2˜g + O(

(4.398)

The ﬁrst requirement we get from (4.397) is that we must have −2˜g− 1≤˜b1≤1 or 1≤˜b1≤−
2˜g − 1. Recall that ˜g is negative given by g = m4˜g. Let us introduce x = −˜b2
1 − 2˜g˜b1. The
above equation becomes

x − 3˜g = ˜g(cid:112)x + 1 + 2˜g ⇔ x2 − (˜g2 + 6˜g)x + 8˜g2 − 2˜g3 = 0.

(4.399)

The equation x = −˜b2

1 − 2˜g˜b1 can be solved to give
˜g2 − x.

(4.400)
These last two equations require that one must have x≤3˜g and x≤˜g2. The explicit solution

We choose always the solution with b2 > b1. Let us also say that the above solution makes

Since m2 is large, it is the ﬁrst region we must consider, and thus one must have ˜g≥˜g+
always. In other words, −2˜g − 1≤ − 2˜g+ − 1<0. Now going back to the requirements
−2˜g − 1≤˜b1≤1 or 1≤˜b1≤ − 2˜g − 1 we can see that we must have in fact −2˜g − 1≤˜b1≤1 or

equivalently (cid:112)˜g2 − x≤1 + ˜g. Using the solution for x we can check that this inequality

indeed holds.

Furthermore, equations (4.242) and (4.243) were obtained with the crucial condition

that [b1, b2] ∩ [a1, a2] = φ. In other words, we must always have ˜b2≤1 or equivalently

− 2˜g

˜g2 + 20˜g + 4≤2˜g2 + 20˜g + 4.

(4.406)

(cid:112)

Both sides of this inequality are positive numbers and the inequality always holds as we
can check by direct calculation.

This solution, which was found for the model with the kinetic term F (∆1), corresponds
to the region where we have two disjoint supports. The background support [a1, a2], which
consists in the limit of large m2 of just one point, and the quantum support [b1, b2]. This
solution is expected to be generic for all models where the kinetic term depends only on
∆1. Among these models, we ﬁnd the Moyal-Weyl plane with the Laplacian ∆1, and the
fuzzy sphere with the Laplacian ∆2
1. It is clear that subleading corrections in powers of
1/m4 of this solution can be computed using the above method.

4.5 Monte Carlo Simulations

4.5.1 Fuzzy Sphere: Algorithms and Phase Diagram

The phase diagram of noncommutative phi-four on the fuzzy sphere is shown on ﬁg-
ure (4.3). The usual phases of commutative phi-four theory are the disordered (rota-
tionally invariant) phase (< T rΦ >= 0) and the uniform ordered phase ( < T rΦ >=

±N(cid:112)−m2/2λ). The phase diagram is found to contain an extra phase (the matrix phase
model. In this novel ”matrix phase” we have instead < T rΦ >= ±(N − 2k)(cid:112)−2m2/λ

or the non-uniform ordered phase) which lies between the two usual phases of the scalar

MFT, Badis Ydri

151

where k is some integer. The transition from disordered to matrix is 3rd order with
continous action and speciﬁc heat.

Hence, fuzzy scalar phi-four theory enjoys three stable phases: i) disordered (symmet-
ric, one-cut, disk) phase, ii) uniform ordered (Ising, broken, asymmetric one-cut) phase
and iii) non-uniform ordered (matrix, stripe, two-cut, annulus) phase. The three phases
meet at a triple point. The non-uniform ordered phase [126] is a full blown nonpertur-
bative manifestation of the perturbative UV-IR mixing eﬀect [84] which is due to the
underlying highly non-local matrix degrees of freedom of the noncommutative scalar ﬁeld.
The problem of the phase structure of fuzzy phi-four was also studied by means of
the Monte Carlo method in [147–153]. The analytic derivation of the phase diagram of
noncommutative phi-four on the fuzzy sphere was attempted in [116–120, 155–157].

Both graphs on ﬁgure (4.3) were generated using the Metropolis algorithm on the
fuzzy sphere. In the ﬁrst graph coupling of the scalar ﬁeld Φ to a U (1) gauge ﬁeld on the
fuzzy sphere is included, and as a consequence, we can employ the U (N ) gauge symmetry
to reduce the scalar sector to only its eigenvalues. In the second graph an approximate
Metropolis algorithm, i.e. it does not satisfy detailed balanced, is used.

Another powerful method which allows us to reduce noncommutative scalar phi-four
theory to only its eigenvalues, without the additional dynamical gauge ﬁeld, is the multi-
trace approach [116–120, 155–157]. See next chapter. The phase diagrams of various mul-
titrace models of noncommutative phi-four on the fuzzy sphere are reported in [169, 170].
They are shown on ﬁgure (4.4).

These phase diagrams were obtained by means of various algorithms which we will

now discuss in some more detail. We have:

• The algorithm used in [147] to compute the phase diagram is based on, a very
complex variation, of the Metropolis algorithm, which does not preserve detailed
balance. In the region of the disordered phase, their algorithm behaves essentially
as the usual Metropolis algorithm, with a processing time per conﬁguration, with
respect to the matrix size, proportional to N 4. The new Metropolis algorithm,
described in [147], behaves better and better, as we go farther and farther, from
the origin, i.e. towards the regions of the uniform and non-uniform phases. The
processing time per conﬁguration, with respect to the matrix size, is claimed to be
proportional to N 3, for the values of N between 4 and 64. See graph 9.12 of F.G
Flores’ doctoral thesis1, where we can ﬁt this region of N with a straight line. Also,
it is worth noting, that this new algorithm involves, besides the usual optimizable
parameters found in the Metropolis algorithm, such as the acceptance rate, a new
optimizable parameter p, which controls the compromise between the speed and the
accuracy of the algorithm. For p = 0 we have a fast process with considerable relative
systematic error, while for p = 1 we have a slow process but a very small relative
error. This error is, precisely, due to the lack of detailed balance. Typically we ﬁx
this parameter around p = 0.55 − 0.7.
The algorithm of [147] is the only known method, until [153, 169, 170], which is

successful in mapping the complete phase diagram of noncommutative phi-four on
the fuzzy sphere. However we had found it, from our experience, very hard to
reproduce this work.

• An alternative method which is, i) conceptually as simple as the usual Metropolis
method, and ii) without systematic errors, and iii) can map the whole phase diagram
is constructed in [153]. In this method the phase diagram of fuzzy phi-four theory is
computed by Monte Carlo sampling of the eigenvalues λi of the scalar ﬁeld Φ. This
was possible by coupling the scalar ﬁeld Φ to a U (1) gauge ﬁeld Xa on the fuzzy
sphere which then allowed us, by employing the U (N ) gauge symmetry, to reduce
scalar phi-four theory to only its eigenvalues, viz

(4.407)

The pure gauge term is such that the gauge ﬁeld Xa is ﬂuctuating around Xa = La, b
and c are essentially the parameters m2 and λ respectively, while a is the parameter
in front of the kinetic term which we have not set equal to one here.

The processing time per conﬁguration, with respect to the matrix size, in this algo-
rithm, is proportional to N 4, which is comparable to the usual Metropolis algorithm,
but with the virtue that we can access the non-uniform phase. There is no systematic
errors in this algorithm, and hence no analogue of the parameter p mention above.
• As mentioned above, another powerful method which allows us to reduce noncommu-
tative scalar phi-four theory to only its eigenvalues, without the additional dynamical
gauge ﬁeld, is the multitrace approach. The multitrace expansion is the analogue
of the Hopping parameter expansion on the lattice in the sense that we perform
a small kinetic term expansion while treating the potential exactly. This should
be contrasted with the small interaction expansion of the usual perturbation the-
ory. The eﬀective action obtained in the multitrace approach is a multitrace matrix
model, depending on various moments mn = T rM n of an N × N matrix M , which
to the lowest non-trivial order is of the form

The parameters B and C are shifted values of b and c. The primed parameters
depend on a. The second line includes terms which depend on the odd moments
m1 and m3. By diagonalization we obtain therefore the N eigenvalues of M as our
independent set of dynamical degrees of freedom with an eﬀective action of the form

Since these models depend only on N independent eigenvalues their Monte Carlo
sampling by means of the Metropolis algorithm does not suﬀer from any ergodic
problem and thus what we get in the simulations is really what should exist in the
model non-perturbatively. The processing time per conﬁguration, with respect to
the matrix size, in this algorithm, is proportional to N 2, which is very fast compared
to previous algorithms.

• We also mention for completeness the algorithm of [150] which is based on a combina-
tion of the Metropolis algorithm and annealing. A systematic study of the behavior
of the eigenvalues distributions of the scalar ﬁeld across the various transition lines
was conducted using this method in [150] .

4.5.2 Fuzzy Torus: Dispersion Relations

The related problem of Monte Carlo simulation of noncommutative phi-four on the
fuzzy torus, and the fuzzy disc was considered in [112], [113], and [154] respectively. For
a recent study see [114].

As an example the phase diagram and the dispersion relation of noncommutative phi-
four on the fuzzy torus in d = 3 is discussed in [113]. The phase diagram, with exactly the
same qualitative features conjectured by Gubser and Sondhi, is shown on ﬁgure 5 of [113].
Three phases which meet at a triple point are identiﬁed. The Ising (disordered-to-uniform)
transition exists for small θ whereas transitions to the stripe phase (disordered-to-stripe
and uniform-to-stripe) are favored at large θ. The collapsed parameters in this case are
found to be given by

N 2m2 , N 2λ.

(4.410)

On the other hand, the dispersion relations are computed as usual from the exponential
decay of the correlation function

< ˜Φ∗((cid:126)p, t) ˜Φ((cid:126)p, t + τ )

(4.411)

(cid:88)

t

1
T

This behaves as exp(−E((cid:126)p)τ ) for large τ and thus we can extract the energy E((cid:126)p) by
computing the above correlator as a function of τ . In the disordered phase, i.e. small λ
near the uniform phase, we ﬁnd the usual linear behavior E((cid:126)p) = a(cid:126)p2 and thus in this
region the model looks like its commutative counterpart. As we increase λ we observe
that the rest energy E0 ≡ E((cid:126)0) increases, followed by a sharp dip at some small value of

MFT, Badis Ydri

154

the momentum (cid:126)p2, then the energy rises again with (cid:126)p2 and approaches asymptotically the
linear behavior E((cid:126)p) = a(cid:126)p2 for (cid:126)p2 −→ ∞. An example of a dispersion relation near the
stripe phase, for m2 = −15, λ = 50, is shown on ﬁgure 14 of [113] with a ﬁt given by

exp(−c2

(cid:126)p2 + ¯m2).

(4.412)

E2((cid:126)p) = c0(cid:126)p2 + m2 +

c1(cid:112)(cid:126)p2 + ¯m2

(cid:112)

The parameters ci and ¯m2 are given by equation (6.2) of [113]. The minimum in this
case occurs around the cases k = N|(cid:126)p|/2π =
5 so this corresponds actually to a
multi-stripe pattern.

The above behavior of the dispersion relations stabilizes in the continuum limit deﬁned
c = −15.01(8))
by the double scaling limit N −→ ∞ (planar limit), a −→ 0 (m2 −→ m2
keeping λ and θ = N a2/π ﬁxed. In this limit the rest energy E0 is found to be divergent,
N ∝ 1/a, in full agreement with the UV-IR mixing. The shifting of the
linearly with
energy minimum to a ﬁnite non-vanishing value of the momentum in this limit indicates the
formation of a stable stripe phase in the continuum noncommutative theory. The existence
of a continuum limit is also a strong indication that the theory is non-perturbatively
renormalizable.

4.6

Initiation to the Wilson Renormalization Group

4.6.1 The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point in NC Φ4

In this section we will apply the renormalization group recursion formula of Wilson
[128] as applied, with great success, in [131, 132, 211] to ordinary vector models and to
hermitian matrix models in the large N limit. Their method can be summarized as follows:

1) We will split the ﬁeld into a background and a ﬂuctuation and then integrate the

ﬂuctuation obtaining therefore an eﬀective action for the background ﬁeld alone.

2) We will keep, following Wilson, only induced corrections to the terms that are al-
ready present in the classical action. Thus we will only need to calculate quantum
corrections to the 2− and 4−point functions.

3) We perform the so-called Wilson contraction which consists in estimating momentum

loop integrals using the following three approximations or rules:

– Rule 1: All external momenta which are wedged with internal momenta will

be set to zero.

– Rule 2: We approximate every internal propagator ∆(k) by ∆(λ) where λ is a

typical momentum in the range ρΛ ≤ λ ≤ Λ.

– Rule 3: We replace every internal momentum loop integral (cid:82)

k by a typical

volume.

The two last approximations are equivalent to the reduction of all loop integrals to
their zero dimensional counterparts. These two approximations are quite natural in
the limit ρ −→ 1.

MFT, Badis Ydri

155

As it turns out we do not need to use the ﬁrst approximation in estimating the
2−point function. In fact rule 1 was proposed ﬁrst in the context of a non-commutative
Φ4 theory in [110] in order to simply the calculation of the 4−point function. In some
sense the ﬁrst approximation is equivalent to taking the limit ¯θ = θΛ2 −→ 0.

4) The last step in the renormalization group program of Wilson consists in rescaling
the momenta so that the cutoﬀ is restored to its original value. We can then obtain
renormalization group recursion equations which relate the new values of the coupling
constants to the old values.

This strategy was applied to the noncommutative Φ4 in [110] and to a noncommutative
O(N ) sigma mode in [167]. In the context of the O(N ) sigma model, discussed in the next
section, we can take into account, in the large N limit, all leading Feynman diagrams and
not only the one-loop diagrams and thus the result is non perturbative. In this section
we will apply the above Wilson renormalization group program to noncommutative Φ4
model, i.e. to a noncommutative O(1) sigma model, to derive the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed in
this case. We will follow [110].

The constant comes from the quartic terms in ΦH whereas S4[φL] comes from the zeroth
order term in ΦH . The cubic and the linear terms in ΦH vanish because the path integral
is even under the Z2 symmetry φH −→ −φH . The coeﬃcient 6 comes from the fact that

This should vanish for large distances as it should be as long as d − 2 + γ > 0. Thus for
large values of θ we get an instability because d − 2 + γ becomes negative. The critical
value of θ is precisely given by

d − 2 + γc = 0 ⇒ (θcΛ2)2 =

This behavior is certainly consistent above D = 4 where it is expected that the Gaussian

give 2−loop mass corrections. The fourth gives a constant. The ﬁfth is a reducible
correction to the 4−point function. We get using Wick’s theorem

The noncommutative Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point is only stable for θ < θc.

(4.485)

(4.486)

The above negative anomalous dimension, which is due to the non-locality of the
theory, leads immediately to the existence of a ﬁrst order transition to a modulated phase
via the Lifshitz scenario [210]. Indeed, we can show that below the critical value θc the
coeﬃcient of k2 is positive whereas above θc the coeﬃcient of k2 becomes negative and
thus one requires, to maintain stability, the inclusion of the term proportional to k4 which
turns out to have a positive coeﬃcient as opposed to the commutative theory. We can
show explicitly that at θ = θc the dispersion relation changes from k2 to k4. Thus the
eﬀective action is necessarily of the form (with positive a and b)

(2π)d φ(k)φ(−k)(cid:2)(1 − agθΛ2)k2 + bk4(cid:3) + interaction.

ddk

(cid:90)

(4.487)

The Lifshitz point is a tri-critical point in the phase diagram where the coeﬃcient of k2
vanishes exactly and that of k4 is positive. In this case, this point is given precisely by
the value θ = θc, and the transition is a ﬁrst order transition because it is not related to
a change of symmetry. In this transition the system develops a soft mode associated with
the minimum of the kinetic energy and as a consequence the ordering above θc is given
by a modulating order parameter. A more thorough discussion of this point can be found
in [110].

4.6.2 The Noncommutative O(N ) Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point

A non perturbative study of the Ising universality class ﬁxed point in noncommutative
O(N ) model can be carried out along the above lines [167, 209]. In this case the analysis
is exact in 1/N . It is found that the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point makes good sense only
for suﬃciently small values of θ up to a certain maximal noncommutativity. This ﬁxed
point describes the transition from the disordered phase to the uniform ordered phase.
Another ﬁxed point termed the noncommutative Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point is identiﬁed
in this case. It interpolates between the commutative Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point of the
Ising universality class which is found to lie at zero value of the critical coupling constant
a∗ of the zero dimensional reduction of the theory and a novel strongly interacting ﬁxed
point which lies at inﬁnite value of a∗ corresponding to maximal noncommutativity. This
is identiﬁed with the transition between non-uniform and uniform orders.

4.6.3 The Matrix Fixed Point

As discussed above, in the Wilson recursion formula we perform the usual truncation
but also we perform a reduction to zero dimension which allows explicit calculation, or
more precisely estimation, of Feynman diagrams. This method was also applied to non-
commutative scalar φ4 ﬁeld theory at the self-dual point on a degenerate noncommutative
spacetime with two strongly noncommuting directions [168, 209]. In the matrix basis this
theory becomes, after appropriate non-perturbative deﬁnition, an N × N matrix model
where N is a regulator in the noncommutative directions, i.e. N here has direct connec-
tion with noncommutativity itself. More precisely, in order to solve the theory we propose
to employ, following [130–132], a combination of

• i) the Wilson approximate renormalization group recursion formula

and

• ii) the solution to the zero dimensional large N counting problem given in this case
by the Penner matrix model which can be turned into a multitrace matrix model for
large values of θ.

As discussed neatly in [130] the virtue and power of combining these two methods lies
in the crucial fact that all leading Feynman diagrams in 1/N will be counted correctly
in this scheme including the so-called ”setting sun” diagrams. The analysis in this case
is also exact in 1/θ.
In the same way that the noncommutative Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed
point describes transition from the disordered phase to the uniform ordered phase the
matrix model ﬁxed point, obtained in this model, describes the transition from the one-
cut (disordered) phase to the two-cut (non-uniform ordered, stripe) phase.

Thus the analysis of phi-four theory on noncommutative spaces using a combination of
the Wilson renormalization group recursion formula and the solution to the zero dimen-
sional vector/matrix models at large N suggests the existence of three ﬁxed points. The
matrix model θ = ∞ ﬁxed point which describes the disordered-to-non-uniform-ordered
transition. The Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point at θ = 0 which describes the disordered-to-
uniform-ordered transition, and a noncommutative Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point at a max-

The Multitrace Approach

5.1 Phase Structure of Fuzzy and Noncommuta-
tive Φ4

A scalar phi-four theory on a non-degenerate noncommutative Euclidean spacetime is

a matrix model of the form

S = TrH

(cid:0)aΦ∆Φ + bΦ2 + cΦ4(cid:1).

(5.1)

The Laplacian ∆ deﬁnes the underlying geometry, i.e. the metric, of the noncommutative
Euclidean spacetime in the sense of [124, 125]. This is a three-parameter model with the
following three known phases:

• The usual 2nd order Ising phase transition between disordered < Φ >= 0 and uni-
form ordered < Φ >∼ 1 phases. This appears for small values of c. This is the only
transition observed in commutative phi-four, and thus it can be accessed in a small
noncommutativity parameter expansion, using conventional Wilson renormalization
group equation [128]. See [167] for an analysis along this line applied to the O(N )
version of the phi-four theory.

• A matrix transition between disordered < Φ >= 0 and non-uniform ordered < Φ >∼
Γ phases with Γ2 = 1H . For a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space H, this transition
√
coincides, for very large values of c, with the 3rd order transition of the real quartic
matrix model, i.e. the model with a = 0, which occurs at b = −2
N c. In terms of
˜b = bN−3/2 and ˜c = cN−2 we have

√
˜b = −2

˜c.

(5.2)

This is therefore a transition from a one-cut (disc) phase to a two-cut (annulus)
phase [141, 142].

• A transition between uniform ordered < Φ >∼ 1H and non-uniform ordered < Φ >∼
Γ phases. The non-uniform phase, in which translational/rotational invariance is
spontaneously broken, is absent in the commutative theory. The non-uniform phase
is essentially the stripe phase observed originally on Moyal-Weyl spaces in [109,112].

MFT, Badis Ydri

Let us discuss a little further the phase structure of the pure potential model V =
TrH (bΦ2 + cΦ4), in the case when the Hilbert space H is N−dimensional, in some more
detail. The ground state conﬁgurations are given by the matrices

(cid:114)

− b
2c

Φγ =

Φ0 = 0.

U γU + , γ2 = 1N , U U + = U +U = 1N .

(5.3)

(5.4)

We compute V [Φ0] = 0 and V [Φγ] = −b2/4c. The ﬁrst conﬁguration corresponds to
the disordered phase characterized by < Φ >= 0. The second solution makes sense
only for b < 0, and it corresponds to the ordered phase characterized by < Φ >(cid:54)= 0.
√
As mentioned above, there is a non-perturbative transition between the two phases which
occurs quantum mechanically, not at b = 0, but at b = b∗ = −2
N c, which is known as the
one-cut to two-cut transition. The idempotent γ can always be chosen such that γ = γk =
diag(1k,−1N−k). The orbit of γk is the Grassmannian manifold U (N )/(U (k)× U (N − k))
which is dk−dimensional where dk = 2kN − 2k2.
It is not diﬃcult to show that this
dimension is maximum at k = N/2, assuming that N is even, and hence from entropy
argument, the most important two-cut solution is the so-called stripe conﬁguration given
by γ = diag(1N/2,−1N/2).
In this real quartic matrix model, we have therefore three
possible phases characterized by the following order parameters:

< Φ >= 0 disordered phase.

< Φ >= ±

2c

1N Ising (uniform) phase.

(cid:114)

< Φ >= ±

− b
2c

γ matrix (nonuniform or stripe) phase.

(5.7)

The above picture is expected to hold for noncommutative/fuzzy phi-four theory in any
dimension, and the three phases are expected to meet at a triple point. This structure was
conﬁrmed in two dimensions by means of Monte Carlo simulations on the fuzzy sphere
in [147, 148]. The phase diagram looks like those shown on ﬁgures (4.3). Both ﬁgures
were generated using the Metropolis algorithm on the fuzzy sphere. In the ﬁrst ﬁgure
coupling of the scalar ﬁeld Φ to a U(1) gauge ﬁeld on the fuzzy sphere is included, and
as a consequence, we can employ the U(N) gauge symmetry to reduce the scalar sector to
only its eigenvalues.

The problem of the phase structure of fuzzy scalar phi-four was also studied in [149–
152]. The analytic derivation of the phase diagram of noncommutative phi-four on the
fuzzy sphere was attempted in [117, 118, 155, 156]. The related problem of Monte Carlo
simulation of noncommutative phi-four on the fuzzy torus, and the fuzzy disc was consid-
ered in [112], [113], and [154] respectively. For a recent study see [114].

5.2 Noncommutative Phi-Four Revisited

5.2.1 The Moyal-Weyl Plane R2

θ,Ω

We start by considering a phi-four theory on a generic noncommutative Moyal-Weyl
space Rd
θ with d = 2. We introduce non-commutativity in momentum space by introducing
a minimal coupling to a constant background magnetic ﬁeld Bij, as was done originally
by Langmann, Szabo and Zarembo in [93, 94]. The most general action with a quartic
potential takes, in the operator basis, the form

The famous Grosse-Wulkenhaar model corresponds to σ = ˜σ and λ

without any loss of generality σ = ˜σ = 1/4. The Grosse-Wulkenhaar model corresponds
to the addition of a harmonic oscillator potential to the kinetic action which modiﬁes,
and thus allows us, to control the IR behavior of the theory. A particular version of this
theory was shown to be renormalizable by Grosse and Wulkenhaar in [87–89]. The action
of interest, in terms of the star product, is given by

The harmonic oscillator coupling constant Ω is deﬁned by Ω2 = B2θ2/4 whereas the
coordinate ˜xi is deﬁned by ˜xi = 2(θ−1)ijxj.
It was shown in [92] that this action is
covariant under a duality transformation which exchanges among other things positions
and momenta as xi ↔ ˜ki = B−1
ij kj. The value Ω2 = 1 in particular gives an action which
is invariant under this duality transformation. The theory at Ω2 = 1 is essentially the
original Langmann-Szabo model.

Under the ﬁeld/operator Weyl map we can rewrite the above action as

A more rigorous regularization of noncommutative Φ4−theory with a harmonic oscillator

5.2.2 The Fuzzy Sphere S2

N,Ω

The fuzzy sphere [200, 201] is the spectral triple (MatN , HN , ∆N ), where MatN is
the algebra of N × N hermitian matrices, HN is the Hilbert space associated with the
irreducible representation of SU (2) with spin (N −1)/2 , and ∆N = ˆLa ˆLa is the Laplacian
on the fuzzy sphere where ˆLa are inner derivations given by ˆLa = [La, ...] with La being the
generators of SU (2). The fuzzy sphere is an elegant regulator which preserves symmetry,
supersymmetry and topology. For more detail see for example [138].

A real scalar ﬁeld ˆΦ on the fuzzy sphere is an element of the matrix algebra MatN .

The action of a Φ4−theory is given explicitly by

N limit. On the other hand, it scales as N on the fuzzy sphere, and the correct deﬁnition
of the kinetic matrix is given by

The fundamental question we want to answer is: can we integrate the unitary group
completely?

The answer, which is the straightforward and obvious one, is to expand the kinetic
term in powers of a, perform the integral over U , then resume the sum back into an
exponential to obtain an eﬀective potential. This is very reminiscent of the hopping
parameter expansion on the lattice.

Towards this end, we will expand the scalar ﬁeld ˆΦ in the basis formed from by the

Since the trace part of the scalar ﬁeld drops from the kinetic action, the above path integral
can be rewritten solely in terms of the diﬀerences λi − λj of the eigenvalues. Furthermore,
this path integral must also be invariant under any permutation of the eigenvalues, as
well as under the parity λi −→ −λi, and hence it can only depend on the following two

(5.85)

In ordinary perturbation theory, we usually assume that the potential, or more precisely
the interaction term, is suﬃciently small so that we can expand around the free theory
given by the quadratic part of the action, i.e. kinetic+mass terms. The idea behind
the multitrace approach is exactly the reverse.
In other words, we will treat exactly
the potential term, i.e.
interaction+mass terms, while we will treat the kinetic term
perturbatively. Technically, this is motivated by the fact that the only place where the
unitary matrix U appears is the kinetic term, and it is obviously very interesting to carry
out explicitly the corresponding path integral over it. This approximation will clearly
work if, for whatever reason, the kinetic term is indeed small compared to the potential
term which, as it turns out, is true in the matrix phase of noncommutative phi-four theory.
We note that the multitrace approach is analogous to the hopping parameter expansion
on the lattice. See for example [158, 159].

In expanding the kinetic term we have only retained upto quartic powers in Λ in the
spirit of Wilson truncation in the renormalization group which limits the expansion of the
eﬀective action to only those terms which are already present in the bare action [128].

At 0th order the above path integral is precisely equivalent to a pure real quartic

matrix model, viz

Z =

(cid:90)

dΛ∆2(Λ) exp(cid:0) − T rN

(cid:2)bΛ2 + cΛ4(cid:3)(cid:1).

(5.90)

MFT, Badis Ydri

182

At 1st order we need to calculate the group integral I1. We can use for example
the diagramatic method developed in [160, 202, 203] to evaluate this integral. However,
this method becomes very tedious already at the next higher order when we evaluate
I2. Fortunately, the group theoretic method developed in [155, 156], for precisely non-
commutative and fuzzy models, is very elegant and transparent, and furthermore, it is
very eﬀective in evaluating SU (N ) integrals such as I1 and I2.

We want to compute

(5.91)
We will use T rN 2(A ⊗ B) = (T rN A)(T rN B) and (A ⊗ C)(B ⊗ D) = AB ⊗ CD. In other
words, the original N−dimensional Hilbert space corresponding to the fundamental rep-
resentation N of SU(N) is replaced with the N 2−dimensional Hilbert space corresponding
to the tensor product N ⊗ N . We have then

(cid:90)

1st order = KAB

dU T rN 2(U ΛU−1tA) ⊗ (U ΛU−1tB)
dU T rN 2(U ⊗ U )(Λ ⊗ Λ)(U−1 ⊗ U−1)(tA ⊗ tB).

(5.92)

Under the action of SU (N ) the N 2−dimensional Hilbert space is the direct sum of the
subspaces corresponding to the irreducible representations ρ contained in N⊗N . The trace
T rN 2 reduces, therefore, to the sum of the traces T rρ in the irreducible representations ρ,
viz

1st order = KAB

5.4.2 The Eﬀective Matrix Action

Quadratic and Quartic Correction

Quadratic Correction: Now, we need to know the set of irreducible representations
of SU(N) contained in N ⊗ N and their dimensions. Clearly, an object carrying two
fundamental indices i and j can be symmetrized or antisymmetrized. The symmetric
representation ρS = m(1,2) contains dim(ρS) = (N 2 + N )/2 components, whereas the
antisymmetric representation m(2,1) = ρA contains dim(ρA) = (N 2 − N )/2 components.
The Young tableau showing the decomposition of N ⊗ N into its irreducible parts (where
the boxes are also labeled by the vector indices A of the Gell-Mann matrices tA) is

A ⊗ B = A B ⊕ A

In terms of dimensions we write

Calculation of the Coeﬃcients s1,2, s2,1, s1,4, s4,1, s2,3, s3,2 and s2,2

The traces ti are of order N and they are deﬁned by

ti = T rN Λi.

(5.120)

The remaining task, which is again very lengthy and tedious, is to compute explicitly
the coeﬃcients s. Let us sketch, for example, the calculation of s1,2, s2,1. By using the
identities (B.29), and the properties of the Gell-Mann matrices tA, we have

(5.123)

Since the ﬁrst term in the above contribution does involve Kaa, which does not depend
on the trace part of the scalar ﬁeld, we must be able to rewrite this term in terms of the
diﬀerences λi − λj of the eigenvalues. Indeed, this term does only depend on the function

The calculation of the other coeﬃcients s1,4, s4,1, s2,3, s3,2 and s2,2 goes along the same
lines. It is, however, very lengthy and tedious. This calculation is found in the appendix.
Here, we will only sketch the formalism and the crucial steps of the calculation, while we
will leave the mostly technical detail to the appendix.

We have ﬁve coeﬃcients to compute but only four are independent. Indeed, from the
result (5.112) we obtain, by substituting Λ = 1, the constraint between the coeﬃcients
given by

Obviously the appearance of K00, on the left hand side, depends only on the trace part of
the scalar ﬁeld which drops, from the kinetic part of the action, if the harmonic oscillator
term is set to zero. We expect therefore that this term be proportional to

We know that, in the limit Ω2 −→ 0 (

ω −→ −1), the trace part of the scalar ﬁeld
drops from the kinetic action, and as a conseqeunce, the action (6.1) can be rewritten solely
in terms of the diﬀerences λi− λj of the eigenvalues. Furthermore, in this limit, the action
(6.1) must also be invariant under any permutation of the eigenvalues, as well as under
the parity λi −→ −λi, and hence it can only depend on the following two functions [155]

The deﬁnition of the coeﬃcients v and w is obvious. Clearly, the coeﬃcient w vanishes
ω −→ −1, since this term can not be rewritten solely in terms
as
of the functions T2 and T4, whereas the coeﬃcient v is found to be non zero as opposed
to the result of [155]. We discuss now the explicit calculation of the last two coeﬃcients
v and w appearing in the action (5.150).

The operators T 2

2 and t2T2 are of order N 4 and N 3 respectively, whereas the eﬀective
action is expected to be of order N 2, and hence, we only need to look for terms of order
1/N 2 and 1/N in the coeﬃcients v and w respectively. As it turns out, the leading
contributions, in the large N limit, in the coeﬃcients w and v are precisely of order 1/N

In the above equation we have also included a possible scaling of the ﬁeld/matrix M ,
which is not included in [147, 148], given by δλ. The scaling of the parameter a encodes
the scaling of the radius R2 or equivalently the noncommutativity parameter θ. There
is of course an extra parameter in the above action given by d = aΩ2, or equivalently
√
ω = (Ω2 − 1)/(Ω2 + 1), which comes with another scaling δd not discussed altogether in
Monte Carlo simulations.

Let us go back now and write down the complete eﬀective action in terms of the
eigenvalues. This is the sum of the classical potential, the Vadermonde determinant and
the eﬀective potential (5.153). This reads explicitly

In the following, we will often denote the eigenvalues without the tilde for ease of notation,
i.e. we will set ˜λi = λi.

5.5.2 Saddle Point Equation

The above saddle point equation (5.174) can be solved using the approach outlined

in [144]. See also next section for more detail.

In the large N limit all statistical properties of the spectrum of M are encoded in the

resolvent W (z), i.e. the one-point function, deﬁned by

(5.175)

From this deﬁnition we can immediately remark that W (z) is singular when z approaches
the spectrum of M . In general, the eigenvalues of M are real numbers in some range [a, b].
In the large N limit we can also introduce a density of eigenvalues ρ(λ) which is positive
deﬁnite and normalized to one, viz

ρ(λ)≥0 ,

ρ(λ)dλ = 1.

(5.176)

Thus, the sum will be replaced by an integral such that

(5.179)

The contour is a large circle which encloses the interval [a, b]. In terms of the resolvent,
the density of eigenvalues is therefore obtained, with a contour which is very close to [a, b],
by the formula

ρ(λ) = − 1
2πi

(W (λ + i0) − W (λ − i0)).

(5.180)

In other words, knowing W (z) will give ρ(λ). In terms of the resolvent W (z), the saddle
point equation (5.174) is rewritten as

W 2(z) = V

(5.181)

(5.182)

This is much simpler than the original saddle point equation. It remains only to determine
the coeﬃcients of P (z), which is a much smaller number of unknown, in order to determine
W (z). Knowing W (z) solves the whole problem since it will give ρ(λ). This W (z) can have
many cuts with endpoints located where the polynomial under the square-root vanishes.

The next assumption is to suppose a symmetric support of the eigenvalues distributions,
and as a consequence, all odd moments vanish identically. This is motivated by the fact
that the expansion of the eﬀective action employed in the current paper, i.e. the multitrace
technique, is expected to probe, very well, the transition between the disordered phase
and the non-uniform ordered phase. The uniform ordered phase, and as a consequence the
other two transition lines, of the original model S must also be embedded in the matrix
model Vr2,Ω because these two models, S and Vr2,Ω, are exactly identical.

MFT, Badis Ydri

196

We will, therefore, assume that across the transition line between disordered phase
and non-uniform ordered phase, the matrix M remains massless, and the eigenvalues
distribution ρ(˜λ) is always symmetric, and hence all odd moments ˜mq vanish identically,
viz

˜mq =

d˜λρ(˜λ)˜λq = 0 , q = odd.

5.6 The Real Quartic Matrix Model

In this section, we will follow the pedagogical presentation of [144] in deriving the
various eigenvalues distributions of the real quartic matrix model. First, we will pretend
that the parameters µ and g are just shifted values with respect to the original parameters
˜b = N 3/2b and ˜c = N 2c, then, in the next section, we will take into account the fact that
µ depends on the second moment ˜m2, which is itself computed in terms of the eigenvalues
distribution, and thus a deformation of the critical line is entailed.

5.6.1 Free Theory

(cid:112)

For g = 0, we ﬁnd the famous Wigner semi-circle law, viz

ρ(λ) =

1
π

µ

δ2 − λ2 , δ2 =

2
µ

.

(5.192)

The derivation of this law is straightforward.

5.6.2 The Symmetric One-Cut (Disordered) Phase

(cid:48)

The classical minimum of the potential V is given by the condition V

(z) = 2z(µ +
2gz2) = 0. In other words, V can have only one minimum at z = 0 for positive values
of µ and g. Therefore, we can safely assume that the support of ρ(λ) will consist, in
this case, of one connected region [δ1, δ2] which means that all eigenvalues of M lie at
the bottom of the well around M = 0. In this case the resolvent W (z) has one cut in
the complex plane along [δ1, δ2] with branch points at z = δ1 and z = δ2. Thus, the
(cid:48)2(z) − 4P (z), which is under the square-root, must have two single roots
polyonmial V
corresponding to the branch points while all other roots are double roots.

The above argument works when both µ and g are positive. For the more interesting
case when either µ or g is negative4 the potential can have two equivalent minima but the
rest of the analysis will still be valid around one of the minima of the model. We will only
consider here the possibility of µ negative for obvious stability reasons. We get therefore
the ansatz

(cid:48)2(z) − 4P (z) = M 2(z)(z − δ1)(z − δ2).

(5.194)

V

We compute

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

P (z) = 2µ + 4gz2 + 4g

dλρ(λ)λ2 + 4gz

dλρ(λ)λ.

(5.195)

4The possibility of g negative is more relevant to quantum gravity in two dimensions. Indeed, a second order
phase transition occurs at the value g = −µ2/12. This is the pure gravity critical point. The corresponding
density of eigenvalues ρ(λ) is given by

ρ(λ) =

(λ2 − δ2)

2

3 .

2g
π

(5.193)

MFT, Badis Ydri

198

In above we can use the fact that since the potential V is even, we must have δ2 = −δ1 ≡

−δ, and hence we must have the identity(cid:82) dλρ(λ)λ = 0, i.e.

P (z) = 2µ + 4gm2 + 4gz2.

(5.196)

Let us note that in the large z region the resolvent behaves as 1/z. Hence in this region
we have, from equation (5.182), the behavior

where Pol stands for the polynomial part of the ratio. Now, from the behavior V
4gz3 when z −→ ∞, M (z) must behave, from (5.197), as 4gz2 when z −→ ∞. However,
M (z) must be at most quadratic from the fact that P (z) is quadratic together with
equation (5.194). We must then have

(cid:48)

M (z) = 4gz2 + e.

(5.199)

Indeed, we can compute directly from (5.198) that

M (z) = Pol

2z(µ + 2gz2)
√

z2 − δ2

= 4gz2 + 2(µ + gδ2).

(5.200)

In other words, e = 2(µ + gδ2). Putting all these things together we obtain

W (z) = µz + 2gz3 − (2gz2 + µ + gδ2)

(5.201)
This function must still satisfy the condition W ∼ 1/z for large z. This gives an extra
equation5 which must be solved for δ. We have then

z2 − δ2.

(5.202)

(5.203)

(5.204)

5This is equivalent, from equation (5.179), to the requirement that the eigenvalues density ρ(λ) must be

normalized to one.

MFT, Badis Ydri

Finally from (5.180), we derive the density of eigenvalues

(cid:112)

ρ(λ) =

1
π

(2gλ2 + µ + gδ2)

δ2 − λ2.

199

(5.205)

It is not diﬃcult to check that the above density of eigenvalues is positive deﬁnite for
positive values of µ. For negative values of µ, we must have, in order for ρ to be positive
deﬁnite on the interval [−δ, δ], the condition

µ + gδ2 ≥ 0.

This leads, by using (5.204), to the requirement
√
µ2 ≤ 4g ⇔ µ = −2

g.

(5.206)

(5.207)

At µ2 = 4g we must have a 3rd order phase transition6 from the phase with a density of
eigenvalues given by (5.205), with a support given by one cut which is the interval [−δ, δ],
to a diﬀerent phase where the suport of the density of eigenvalues consists of two cuts
symmetric around λ = 07.

5.6.3 The Two-Cut (Non-Uniform-Ordered) Phase

√
We observe that the eigenvalues distribution (5.205) at µ = −2

g, or equivalently

µ = −gδ2, becomes given by

(cid:112)

ρ(λ) =

2gλ2

π

δ2 − λ2.

(5.208)

This vanishes at λ = 0, and thus eﬀectively the support of the eigenvalues distribution at
√
µ = −2
g consists of two cuts [0, δ] and [−δ, 0]. For more negative values of the mass
parameter µ, beyond µ = −2
g, the support of the eigenvalues distribution will split into
two disconnected cuts [−δ2,−δ1] and [δ1, δ2] with δ2 ≥ δ1. We start therefore from the
ansatz

√

(cid:48)2(z) − 4P (z) = M 2(z)(z2 − δ2

1)(z2 − δ2
2).

V

Again we have

P (z) = 2µ + 4gm2 + 4gz2.

(5.209)

(5.210)

Now the behavior of the resolvent as 1/z in the large z region gives

M (z) = Pol

6This can be seen by computing the speciﬁc heat and observing that its derivative is discontinuous at this
7Again, this is because the potential is even under M −→ −M .

MFT, Badis Ydri

200

From the behavior V
We write then

(cid:48)

(z) ∼ 4gz3 when z −→ ∞, M (z) must behave as 4gz when z −→ ∞.

M (z) = 4gz + e.

(5.212)

(cid:113)

It is not diﬃcult to verify that e = 0 in this case. We obtain then

W (z) = µz + 2gz3 − 2gz

(z2 − δ2

1)(z2 − δ2
2).

(5.213)
This function must also satisfy the condition W ∼ 1/z for large z. This gives the extra

At µ = −2

density of eigenvalues (5.208). This is the sense in which this phase transition is termed
critical although it is actually 3rd order.

Alternative Derivation:
In deriving the two-cut solution, we may follow the more
compact formalism of [204]. We rewrite the saddle point equation (5.174), together with
(5.289) and introducing a symmetric density of eigenvalues ρ(˜λ), as

The two cuts are given by the two intervals [−δ2,−δ1] and [δ1, δ2]. Obviously, for the
one-cut solution we must set δ1 = 0 and δ2 = δ. We introduce now the reparametrization

z = µ + 2gx2 , y(z) =

5.6.4 The Asymmetric One-Cut (Uniform-Ordered) Phase
The real quartic matrix model admits also a solution with T rM (cid:54)= 0 corresponding
to a possible uniform-ordered (Ising) phase. This U (N )−like solution can appear only
for negative values of the mass parameter µ, and it is constructed, for example, in [142].
It is, however, well known that this solution can not yield to a stable phase without the
addition of the kinetic term to the real quartic matrix model.

We will consider then a one-cut solution centered around τ in the interval [σ−τ, σ +τ ].

In this case, we start from the ansatz

(cid:48)2(z) − 4P (z) = M 2(z)(z − (σ + τ ))(z − (σ − τ )).

V

(5.230)

The polynomial P contains now the eﬀect of the ﬁrst moment which does not vanish in
this phase, viz

Again, we must have for large z the behavior

P (z) = 2µ + 4gm2 + 4gz2 + 4gzm1.

In other words,

This yields to the expression

(z)

V

(cid:48)

.

(5.233)

M (z) = 4gz2 + f z + e.

We get immediately the values

e = 2µ + 2g(2σ2 + τ 2) , f = 4σg.

(5.234)

(5.235)

Thus, we obtain

W (z) = µz + 2gz3 − (2gz2 + 2σgz + µ + 2gσ2 + gτ 2)(cid:112)(z − (σ + τ ))(z − (σ − τ )).(5.236)
(cid:112)(z − (σ + τ ))(z − (σ − τ ))

The requirement that W ∼ 1/z for large z gives the condition

µσ + 2gσ3 + 3gστ 2

2µ(2σ2 + τ 2) + g(cid:0)3(σ2 − τ 2)2 − 30σ2(σ2 − τ 2) + 35σ4(cid:1)

2µ(2σ2 + τ 2) + g(cid:0)3(σ2 − τ 2)2 − 30σ2(σ2 − τ 2) + 35σ4(cid:1) = 4.

The solution is

5.7 Multicut Solutions of the Multitrace Matrix
Model

5.7.1 The One-Cut Phase

The derivation of the eigenvalues distribution (5.205) is still valid when we con-
sider the case of the multitrace matrix model (5.189), with the normalization condition

(cid:82) δ−δ dλρ(λ) = 1 still given by the condition (5.203), only with the substitution (5.191). We

have then the eigenvalues distribution

ρ(λ) =

1
π

(2g0λ2 + µ0 − ˜r4
3

(cid:112)

η ˜m2 + g0δ2)

δ2 − λ2.

The parameters µ0 and g0 are obviously given by

µ0 = ˜b +

˜r2
4

(2 − ) , g0 = ˜c − ˜r4
24

(1 − ).

(5.242)

(5.243)

For stability purposes, we will assume, for simplicity, that g0 is positive deﬁnite. Thus,
the domain of deﬁnition of the quartic coupling constant ˜c is restricted slightly above zero
on the Moyal-Weyl plane.

The normalization condition(cid:82) δ−δ dλρ(λ) = 1 is now given by

MFT, Badis Ydri

204

In the last equation we have used the normalization condition (5.203). In other words, we
have another expression for the second moment given by

˜m2 =

24δ2 − 3µ0δ4
72 − ˜r4ηδ4 .

(5.247)

This formula reduces to the original expression, i.e. to ˜m2 = δ2/3 − µ0δ4/24, if we set
η = 0. By comparing (5.245) and (5.247) we obtain the condition on δ2 = x as the solution
of a depressed quartic equation given by

˜r4ηg0x4 − 72(g0 − ˜r4
18

η)x2 − 48µ0x + 96 = 0.

(5.248)

This condition reduces to the condition (5.203), with µ = µ0 and g = g0, if we set η = 0
for which the multitrace matrix model (5.189) reduces to an ordinary real quartic matrix
model8.

The eigenvalues distribution (5.242) must always be positive deﬁnite, i.e. ρ(λ) ≥ 0 for
all λ ∈ [−δ, δ], and thus we need to require that ρ(0) ≥ 0. We obtain, using also (5.245),
the analogue of the condition (5.206) given in this case by the equation

µ0 − ˜r4
3

η ˜m2 + g0δ2 ≥ 0 ⇔ x2 ≤ x2∗ =

(5.249)
Actually, the condition (5.206) itself is rewritten in terms of x = δ2 as x2 ≤ x2∗. Obviously,
x∗ must also be a solution of the quartic equation (5.248). By substitution, we get the
quadratic equation

.

205

• The range of the solution (5.242) is

µ0 ≥ µ0∗.

(5.254)

This can be seen as follows. By assuming that η is positive9, we can start from
˜r4ηg0x4 + 4˜r4ηx2 ≤ ˜r4ηg0x4∗ + 4˜r4ηx2∗, and use the quartic equation (5.248), to arrive
at the inequality 2(µ0x − µ0∗x∗) ≥ 3g0(x2∗ − x2). Since x∗ ≥ x, we get immediately
(5.254).

• The second moment ˜m2 given by equation (5.247) is positive deﬁnite, for negative
values of µ0, if x2 ≤ 72/˜r4η. This is always satisﬁed for the range (5.249) provided
g0 is restricted as in (5.253).

• The second moment ˜m2 given by equation (5.245) can be written in the form

9g0

(x − x+)(x − x−).

˜m2 =

(5.255)

(5.256)

Obviously x+ > 0 and x− < 0. Thus ˜m2 > 0 if x > x+. We know that x = x+ for
η = 0. For small η, we can then write x = x+ + η∆ + O(η2). A straightforward
calculation, using the quartic equation (5.248), gives

∆ =

+(g0x2

˜r4x2
+ + 4)
72g0(x+ − x−)

> 0.

(5.257)

Explicit Solution: For η (cid:54)= 0, which is equivalent to g0 (cid:54)= 0 or more importantly to
˜r2 (cid:54)= 0, we can deﬁne the reduced parameters

sphere, and  = 0 on plane. The parameters b, c, r2 and
ω are related to the mass
parameter m2, the quartic coupling constant λ, the noncommutativity parameter θ and
the harmonic oscillator parameter Ω, of the original model, by the equations

Let us discuss the connection between the actions (5.1) and (5.271). We note ﬁrst that
the original action (5.1) on the fuzzy sphere, with a non zero harmonic oscillator term, is
deﬁned by the Laplacian [153]

From the Monte Carlo results of [147,148] on the fuzzy sphere with Ω2 = 0, we know that
the scaling behavior of the parameters a, b and c appearing in the action (5.276) is given
by

¯a =

Obviously δr = δa + 1. Further, we will assume a scaling δλ of the eigenvalues λ. Hence, in
order for the eﬀective action to come out of order N 2, we must have the following values

δb = 1 − 2δλ , δc = 1 − 4δλ , δr = −2δλ , δω = 0.

The above saddle point equation (5.288) can be solved using the approach outlined
in [144] for the real single trace quartic matrix model. We only need to account here
for the fact that the mass parameter µ depends on the eigenvalues through the second
moment m2. In other words, besides the normalization condition which the eigenvalues
distribution must satisfy, we must also satisfy the requirement that the computed second
moment m2, using this eigenvalues density, will depend on the mass parameter µ which
itslef is a function of the second moment m2.

For a concise description of the phase structure of the real quartic matrix model
see [142]. The real quartic multitrace matrix model (5.291) admits the same set of stable
phases. These are given by:

The ﬁrst step is to regularize this theory in terms of a ﬁnite N−dimensional matrix Φ and
rewrite the theory in matrix representation. Then we diagonalize the matrix Φ. The mea-
i<j(Φi − Φj)2
is the Vandermonde determinant and dU is the Haar measure. The eﬀective probability
distribution of the eigenvalues Φi can be determined uniquely from the behavior of the

regularized volume V of Rd

This calculation will involve in general planar and non-planar diagrams. However, the non-
planar contribution is always subleading because it is ﬁnite with the exception of possible
divergences arising in the limit p −→ 0 due to the UV-IR mixing. From a technical point

ﬁnite and subleading in the large Λ limit. For example we compute

(5.312)

Npla(2n) is the number of planar contractions of a vertex with 2n legs. In the commutative
theory Npla(2n) will be replaced by the total number of contractions of a vertex with 2n
legs, since we have the same contributions from planar and non-planar diagrams, which
is given by 2nn! >> Npla(2n).

We must also have in the large Λ limit the cluster property. In other words, expectation

(5.320)
In fact, with this normalization all expectation values become ﬁnite in the limit N −→ ∞.
In this limit N −→ ∞ the eigenvalue ϕi becomes a function ϕ(s) where s = i/N ∈ [0, 1]
0 dsf (ϕ). The measure µ(ϕ1, ..., ϕN ) becomes then a measure
µ[ϕ(s)] on the space of functions ϕ : [0, 1] −→ R. A density of eigenvalues ρ can be
introduced by

ρ(ϕ) =

,

dtρ(t) = 1.

(5.321)

The cluster property implies that the measure µ(ϕ1, ..., ϕN ) is localized, namely

< f (ϕi) >= f ( ¯ϕ(s)),

(5.322)

where ¯ϕ(s) is a sharp and dominant saddle point of µ[ϕ(s)]. This saddle point corresponds
to the desired eigenvalues distribution

(5.328)
Hence the eigenvalues Φi are distributed in the interval [−α0, +α0], i.e. α0 is the largest
eigenvalue of Φ. Furthermore, it is well established that the Wigner semi-circle law can
be obtained in the large N limit of the matrix model

(5.332)

This model can be used following [116] to discuss renormalizability and critical behavior of
the original theory (5.306). This discussion requires an explicit deﬁnition of the regulator
used. There are two main regulators which we can use to deﬁne non perturbatively
the Moyal-Weyl spaces R2n
θ and their noncommutative ﬁeld theories. These are fuzzy
projective spaces and fuzzy tori which we will discuss next.

5.8.2

Introducing Fuzzy Projective Spaces

CPn are adjoint orbits of SU (n + 1) which are compact symplectic spaces. The sphere

is precisely the ﬁrst projective space CP1. The space of CPn harmonics is given by

C∞(CPn) = ⊕p=∞

p=0 Vp,0,...,0,p.

(5.333)

Fuzzy CPn are ﬁnite matrix algebras Hom(VN ) where VN are some representations of
su(n + 1). We can show that VN = V (N, 0, ..., 0) and as a consequence

Hom(VN ) = VN ⊗ V ∗

The coordinate functions xa, a = 1, N 2 + 2N , on fuzzy CPn are proportional to the

The lattice size is then L = N a. We consider the unitary operators

(5.348)
The period of mi is exactly N . The range of mi is [0, N − 1] or equivalently [−(N −

In other words, we have rational noncommutativity Θ, for N > 2, and hence a ﬁnite
dimensional representation of the algebra of the noncommutative torus exists. In general
we require N to be odd for Θ to come out rational and thus be guaranteed the existence
of the fuzzy torus. The cutoﬀ in this case becomes

Let us ﬁrst consider the free theory g = 0 following [119]. In the limit N −→ ∞ we know
that planar diagrams dominates and thus the eigenvalues distribution of M , obtained via
the calculation of T rM n, is a Wigner semicircle law

Now the equation of motion of the eigenvalue xi arising from the eﬀective action Seﬀ
contains a linear term in xi plus the Vandermonde contribution plus higher order terms.
Explicitly, we have

(5.372)

We consider now g (cid:54)= 0 following [117]. The semicircle distribution is a solution for g (cid:54)= 0
since it is a solution for g = 0. The term n = 1 alone will give the semicircle law. Thus
the terms n > 1 are cubic and higher order terms which cause the deformation of the
semicircle law. These terms must vanish when evaluated on the semicircle distribution
in order to guarantee that the semicircle distribution remains a solution. We rewrite the
action Seﬀ as the following power series in the eigenvalues

Seﬀ = a2t2 + (a4t4 + a22t2

2) + (a6t6 + a42t4t2 + a222t3
2)

+ (a8 + a62t6t2 + a422a4t2

2 + a2222t4

2) + ...

We impose then the condition

|Wigner = 0 , n > 1.

∂Seﬀ
∂t2n

We use the fact that the moments in the Wigner distribution satisfy

t2n = Cntn , Cn =

(2n)!

n!(n + 1)!

.

We get immediately the conditions

(5.373)

(5.374)

(5.375)

a4 = 0 , a6 = a42 = 0 , a8 = a62 = 0 , 4a44 + a422 = 0 , ....

(5.376)

By plugging these values back into the eﬀective action we obtain the form

F (t2) + (b1 + b2t2)(t4 − 2t2

2)2 + c(t6 − 5t3

Thus the eﬀective action is still an arbitrary function F (t2) of t2 but it is fully ﬁxed in the
higher moments t4, t6,.... The action up to 6 order in the eigenvalues depends therefore
only on t2, viz

Seﬀ =

1

F (t2) + ...

(5.378)

We note that the extra terms vanish for the Wigner semicircle law. The full eﬀective
action is therefore

the result of [155], given by equation (4.5), which involves the term T4 =(cid:80)

It is very strange that the author of [117] notes that their result (5.388) is in agreement with
i(cid:54)=j(xi−xj)4/2.
It is very clear that T4 is not present in the above equation (5.388) which depends instead
i(cid:54)=j(xi − xj)2/2. The work [156] contains the correct
on the term T 2
calculation which agrees with both the results of [117] and [157].

(5.389)

The one-cut-to-two-cut phase transition derived from the eﬀective action Seﬀ will be
appropriately shifted. The equation determining the critical point is still given, as before,
by the condition that the eigenvalues distribution becomes negative. We get [117]

This is precisely the result obtained in [157] with the identiﬁcation a = 1, b = r and
c = 4g.

The above discussion can be generalized in a straightforward way to all CPn. See for
example [118]. The eﬀective action and the properties of the one-cut-to-two-cut transition
can be calculated to any order in t2 as a perturbative power series. The result obtained in
[118] agrees with the previous result found in [156]. However, the elegant non-perturbative

MFT, Badis Ydri

222

method of [118] is more transparent and compact and thus possible errors in the coeﬃcients
of the eﬀective action can be easily spotted and cross checked. The only drawback is that
this method does not allow the calculation of the odd contributions, i.e. terms in the
eﬀective action which depend on odd moments, which are crucial, in our opinion, to the
existence of the uniform ordered phase. These terms can still be calculated with the
method developed in [156].

(6.2)

The operators ˆAi belong to an algebra A. The trace is taken over some inﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert space H and hence T rH[ ˆDi, ˆDj] is (cid:54)=0 in general, i.e. T rH[ ˆDi, ˆDj] is in fact a
topological term [107]. Furthermore we will assume Euclidean signature throughout.

Minima of the model (6.1) are connection operators ˆDi = ˆBi satisfying

i[ ˆBi, ˆBj] =

(6.3)
We view the algebra A as A = Matn(C) ⊗ An. The trace T rH takes the form T rH =
T rnT rHn where Hn is the Hilbert space associated with the elements of An. The conﬁg-
urations ˆDi = ˆBi which solve equation (6.3) can be written as

The sector of this matrix theory which corresponds to a noncommutative U (n) gauge ﬁeld

The operators ˆAi are identiﬁed with the components of the dynamical U (n) noncommu-

(6.1) invariant are implemented by unitary operators U = exp(iΛ) , U U + = U +U =
1 , Λ+ = Λ which act on the Hilbert space H = Hn ⊕ ... ⊕ Hn as ˆDi−→U ˆDiU +, i.e.
ˆAi−→U ˆAiU + − iU [ ˆ∂i, U +] and ˆFij−→U ˆFijU +. In other words U (n) in this setting must
be identiﬁed with U (Hn ⊕ ... ⊕ Hn). The action (6.1) can be put into the form

Finally it is not diﬃcult to show using the Weyl map, viz the map between operators
and ﬁelds, that the matrix action (6.9) is precisely the usual noncommutative U (n) gauge
θ with a star product ∗ deﬁned by the parameter θBij [106,194]. In particular
action on Rd
the trace T rHn on the Hilbert space Hn can be shown to be equal to the integral over

Let us note that although the dimensions dimH and dimHn of the Hilbert spaces H and
Hn are inﬁnite the ratio dimH/dimHn is ﬁnite equal n. The number of independent
unitary transformations which leave the conﬁguration (6.4) invariant is equal to dimH −
dimHn − n2. This is clearly less than dimH for any n ≥ 2. In other words from entropy
counting the U (1) gauge group (i.e. n = 1) is more stable than all higher gauge groups.
The U (1) gauge group is in fact energetically favorable in most of the ﬁnite N matrix
models which are proposed as non-perturbative regularizations of (6.1). Stabilizing U (n)
gauge groups requires adding potential terms to the action. In the rest of this section we
will thus consider only the U (1) case for simplicity.

As we have seen there are planar as well as non-planar corrections to the vacuum po-
larization tensor at one-loop. Non-planar functions are generally UV ﬁnite because of
the noncommutativity of spacetime whereas planar functions are UV divergent as in the
commutative theory and thus requires a renormalization. Indeed, for t−→0 which cor-
responds to integrating over arbitrarily high momenta in the internal loops we see that
planar amplitudes diverge while non-planar amplitudes are regularized by the exponential
exp(− ˜p2

4t ) as long as the external momenta ˜p does not vanish.

Planar functions at one-loop are given from the above analysis by the expressions (also
by suppressing the tensor structure p2δµν − pµpν for simplicity and including an arbitrary
mass scale µ)

This is equal to the beta function of ordinary pure SU (2) gauge theory. Non-planar

this exponential regularizes the behaviour at t−→0 only when the external momentum ˜p

6.3 Quantum Stability

6.3.1 Eﬀective Potential

Quantization of the matrix model (6.1) consists usually in quantizing the model (6.11).
As we will argue shortly this makes sense only for small values of the coupling constant
g2 which are less than a critical value g2∗. Above g2∗ the conﬁguration ˆBi given by (6.4)
ceases to exist, i.e. it ceases to be the true minimum of the theory and as a consequence
the expansion (6.8) does not make sense.

In order to compute this transition we use the one-loop eﬀective action obtained in

the Feynamn-’t Hooft background ﬁeld gauge. We have the result

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Γ = S +

T rdT rad ln

− T rad lnD2.

(6.63)

The operators D2 = DiDi , Di and Fij act by commutators, viz D2(..) = [ ˆDi, [ ˆDi, ..]],
Di(..) = [ ˆDi, ..] and Fij(..) = [ ˆFij, ..]. Next we compute the eﬀective potential in the
conﬁguration ˆDi = −φB−1
ij ˆxj. The curvature ˆFij in this conﬁguration is given by θ ˆFij =
(θ2φ2 − 1)B−1
ij . The trace over the Hilbert space H is regularized such that T rH1 = N is
ij = d. The eﬀective

Thus the conﬁguration ˆDi = −φB−1
ij ˆxj exists only for values of the coupling constant
λ which are less than λ∗. Above λ∗ true minima of the model are given by commuting
operators,i.e.

i[ ˆBi, ˆBj] = 0.

(6.68)
By comparing with (6.3) we see that this phase corresponds to θ = ∞. The limit θ −→ ∞
is the planar theory (only planar graphs survive) [83] which is intimately related to large
N limits of hermitian matrix models [109].

This transition from the noncommutative Moyal-Weyl space (6.3) to the commuting
operators (6.68) is believed to be intimately related to the perturbative UV-IR mixing [84].
Indeed this is true in two dimensions using our formalism here.

In two dimensions we can see that the logarithmic correction to the potential is ab-
sent and as a consequence the transition to commuting operators will be absent. The
perturbative UV-IR mixing is, on the other hand, absent in two dimensions. Indeed, in
two dimensions the ﬁrst nonzero correction to the classical action S in the eﬀective action
(6.63) is given by

We observe that in two dimensions both the planar and non-planar functions are UV ﬁnite,
i.e. renormalization of the vacuum polarization is not required. The infrared divergence
seen when m2 −→ 0 cancel in the diﬀerence ΠP − ΠNP. Furthermore ΠP − ΠNP vanishes
identically in the limit θ −→ 0 or p −→ 0. In other words, there is no UV-IR mixing in
the vacuum polarization in two dimensions.

6.3.2 Impact of Supersymmetry

The situation in four dimensions is more involved [212, 213]. Explicitly, we have found
that the planar contribution to the vacuum polarization is UV divergent as in the com-
mutative theory, i.e. it is logarithmically divergent and thus it requires a renormalization.
Furthermore, it is found that the UV divergences in the 2−, 3− and 4−point functions
at one-loop can be subtracted by a single counter term and hence the theory is renormal-
izable at this order. The beta function of the theory at one-loop is identical to the beta
function of the ordinary pure SU (2) gauge theory. The non-planar contribution to the
vacuum polarization at one-loop is UV ﬁnite because of the noncommutativity and only
it becomes singular in the limit of vanishing noncommutativity and/or vanishing external
momentum. This also means that the renormalized vacuum polarization diverges in the
infrared limit p−→0 and/or θ −→ 0 which is the deﬁnition of the UV-IR mixing.

We expect that supersymmetry will make the Moyal-Weyl geometry and as a conse-
quence the noncommutative gauge theory more stable. In order to see this eﬀect let λa,
a = 1, ..., M be M massless Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group U (H). We consider the modiﬁcation of the action (6.1) given by

S −→ S

The irreducible representation of the Cliﬀord algebra in d dimensions is s = 2

It is not very diﬃcult to check that the coeﬃcient of the logarithmic term in the eﬀective
potential is positive deﬁnite for all M such that M s < 2d − 4. For M s = 2d − 4 the
logarithmic term vanishes identically and thus the background (6.4) is completely stable
at one-loop order. In this case the noncommutative gauge theory (i.e. the star product
representation) makes sense at least at one-loop order for all values of the gauge coupling
constant g. The case M s = 2d − 4 in d = 4 (i.e. M = 1) corresponds to noncommutative
N = 1 supersymmetric U (1) gauge theory. In this case the eﬀective action is given by

In summary, although the Moyal-Weyl geometry is made stable at one-loop order by
the introduction of supersymmetry we still have a UV-IR mixing in the quantum gauge
theory. The picture that supersymmetry stabilizes the geometry is a recurrent theme and
can be conﬁrmed non-perturbatively, whereas the precise connection to the UV-IR mixing
remains unclear.

Initiation to Noncommutative Gauge Theory

6.4
on the Fuzzy Sphere

Noncommutative gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere was introduced in [10, 224]. As we
have already mentioned it was derived as the low energy dynamics of open strings moving
in a background magnetic ﬁeld with S3 metric in [59, 60, 62]. This theory consists of the
Yang-Mills term YM which can be obtained from the reduction to zero dimensions of
ordinary U (N ) Yang-Mills theory in 3 dimensions and a Chern-Simons term CS due to
Myers eﬀect [12]. Thus the model contains three N × N hermitian matrices X1, X2 and
X3 with an action given by

S = YM + CS = − 1

The model was studied perturbatively in [14] and in [15, 16].
In particular in [14] the
eﬀective action for a non-zero gauge ﬂuctuation was computed at one-loop and shown to
contain a gauge invariant UV-IR mixing in the large N limit. Indeed, the eﬀective action
in the commutative limit was found to be given by the expression

The 1 in 1 + 2g2∆3 corresponds to the classical action whereas 2g2∆3 is the quantum cor-
rection. This provides a non-local renormalization of the inverse coupling constant 1/g2.

In above L + 1 = N . The 1 in 1 − (−1)l1+l2+p corresponds to the planar contribution
whereas (−1)l1+l2+p corresponds to the non-planar contribution where p is the external
momentum. The fact that ∆3 (cid:54)= 0 in the limit N −→ 0 means that we have a UV-IR
mixing problem.

The model YM + CS was solved for N = 2 and N = 3 in [19].

It was studied

nonperturbatively in [18] where the geometry in transition was ﬁrst observed.

In [17] a generalized model was proposed and studied in which the normal scalar ﬁeld
was suppressed by giving it a quartic potential V with very large mass. This potential on
its own is an O(3) random matrix model given by

V = N

(6.90)

(cid:20) m2

(cid:21)

The parameter µ is ﬁxed such that µ = m2. The model S + V was studied in [20] and [21]
where the instability of the sphere was interpreted along the lines of an emergent geometry
phenomena. For vanishing potential m2, µ −→ 0 the transition from/to the fuzzy sphere
phase was found to have a discontinuity in the internal energy, i.e. a latent heat (ﬁgure
6.1) and a discontinuity in the order parameter which is identiﬁed with the radius of the
sphere, viz

1
r

=

1

N c2

T rD2

a , Xa = αDa.

(6.91)

This indicates that the transition is ﬁrst order. From the other hand, the speciﬁc heat
was found to diverge at the transition point from the sphere side while it remains constant
from the matrix side (ﬁgure 6.2). This indicates a second order behaviour with critical
ﬂuctuations only from one side of the transition. The scaling of the coupling constant α
in the large N limit is found to be given by ˜α = α
N . We get the critical value ˜αs = 2.1.
The diﬀerent phases of the model are characterized by

For m (cid:54)= 0 and/or µ (cid:54)= 0 the critical point is replaced by a critical line in the ˜β − t plane
where ˜β4 = ˜α4/(1 + m2)3 and t = µ(1 + m2). In other words for generic values of the
parameters the matrix phase persists. The eﬀective potential in these cases was computed
in [14]. We ﬁnd

(6.93)

For µ positive the global minimum is φ+. The 0 is a local maximum and φ− is a local
minimum. In particular for µ = m2 we obtain the global minimum φ+ = 1. For µ negative
the global minimum is still φ+ but 0 becomes a local minimum and φ− a local maximum.
If µ is sent more negative then the global minimum φ+ = 1 becomes degenerate with
φ = 0 at t = − 2
9 and the maximum height of the barrier is given by V− = ˜β4/324 which
3 . The model has a ﬁrst order transition at t = −2/9 where the classical
occurs at φ− = 1
ground states switches from φ+ for t > −2/9 to 0 for t < 2/9.

Let us now consider the eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations. The condition V

(cid:48)
eﬀ = 0 gives us
extrema of the model. For large enough ˜α and large enough m and µ it admits two positive
solutions. The largest solution can be identiﬁed with the ground state of the system. It
will determine the radius of the sphere. The second solution is the local maximum of
Veﬀ and will determine the height of the barrier. As the coupling is decreased these
two solutions merge and the barrier disappears. This is the critical point of the model.
For smaller couplings than the critical value ˜α∗ the fuzzy sphere solution Da = φLa no
longer exists. Therefore, the classical transition described above is signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by quantum ﬂuctuations.

The condition when the barrier disappears is V

merges with the local maximum. Solving the two equations V
value

(cid:48)(cid:48)
eﬀ = 0. At this point the local minimum
(cid:48)(cid:48)
eﬀ = 0 yield the critical

If we take µ negative we see that g∗ goes to zero at µ(1 + m2) = −1/4 and the critical
coupling ˜α∗ is sent to inﬁnity and therefore for µ(1 + m2) < − 1
4 the model has no fuzzy
sphere phase. However in the region − 1
9 the action S + V is completely
positive. It is therefore not suﬃcient to consider only the conﬁguration Da = φLa but
rather all SU (2) representations must be considered. Furthermore for large ˜α the ground
state will be dominated by those representations with the smallest Casimir. This means
that there is no fuzzy sphere solution for µ(1 + m2) < − 2
9 .

4 < µ(1 + m2) < − 2

The limit of interest is the limit µ = m2−→∞. In this case

φ∗ =

(6.96)

This means that the phase transition is located at a smaller value of the coupling constant
˜α as m is increased. In other words the region where the fuzzy sphere is stable is extended
to lower values of the coupling. The phase digaram is shown on ﬁgure 6.3.

MFT, Badis Ydri

239

We note that a simpliﬁed version of our model with V quartic in the matrices, i.e.
m2 = 0 and µ (cid:54)= 0 was studied in [216, 217].
In [218] an elegant pure matrix model
was shown to be equivalent to a gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere with a very particular
form of the potential which in the large N limit leads naturally, at least classically, to
a decoupled normal scalar ﬂuctuation.
In [214, 215] and [219] an alternative model of
gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere was proposed in which ﬁeld conﬁgurations live in the
Grassmannian manifold U (2N )/(U (N + 1)× U (N − 1)). In [219] this model was shown to
possess the same partition function as commutative gauge theory on the ordinary sphere
via the application of the powerful localization techniques.

The matrix phase which is also called the Yang-Mills phase is dominated by commuting
matrices.
It is found that the eigenvalues of the three matrices X1, X2 and X3 are
uniformly distributed inside a solid ball in 3 dimensions. This was also observed in higher
dimensions in [221]. The eigenvalues distribution of a single matrix say X3 can then be
derived by assuming that the joint eigenvalues distribution of the the three commuting
matrices X1, X2 and X3 is uniform. We obtain

ρ(x) =

3

4R3 (R2 − x2).

(6.97)

The parameter R is the radius of the solid ball. We ﬁnd the value R = 2. A one-loop
calculation around the background of commuting matrices gives a value in agreement
with this prediction. These eigenvalues may be interpreted as the positions of D0-branes
in spacetime following Witten [44]. In [220] there was an attempt to give this phase a
geometrical content along these lines.

In summary, we ﬁnd for pure gauge models with global SO(3) symmetry an exotic
line of discontinuous transitions with a jump in the entropy, characteristic of a 1st order
transition, yet with divergent critical ﬂuctuations and a divergent speciﬁc heat with critical
exponent α = 1/2. The low temperature phase (small values of the gauge coupling
constant) is a geometrical one with gauge ﬁelds ﬂuctuating on a round sphere. As the
temperature increased the sphere evaporates in a transition to a pure matrix phase with
no background geometrical structure. These models present an appealing picture of a
geometrical phase emerging as the system cools and suggests a scenario for the emergence
of geometry in the early universe. Impact of supersymmetry is to stabilize the geometry
further against quantum ﬂuctuations [235].

The noncommutative (NC) plane Rd

The star product ∗ on the noncommutative torus can be introduced by means of the map
ˆ∆(x). Indeed it is the the star product f1 ∗ f2(x) of the two functions f1 and f2 ( and not
their ordinary product f1(x)f2(x) ) which corresponds to the Weyl operator ˆf1 ˆf2 given by

ˆf1 ˆf2 =

Equivalently we have

ddxf1 ∗ f2(x) ⊗ ˆ∆(x).

T r ˆf1 ˆf2 ˆ∆(x) = f1 ∗ f2(x).

(6.108)

Let us also recall that derivations on the noncommutative torus are anti-hermitian linear
operators ˆ∂i deﬁned by the commutation relations [ ˆ∂i, ˆxj] = δij or equivalently

[ ˆ∂i, ˆza] = 2πi(Σ−1)a

(6.109)

and [ ˆ∂i, ˆ∂j] = icij where cij are some real-valued c-numbers. In particular we have the

The basic NC action we will study is given by [115]

(cid:90)

SY M = − 1
4g2

ddxtrN (Fij − fij)2∗.

(6.111)

The curvature Fij is deﬁned by Fij = ∂iAj − ∂jAi + i[Ai, Aj]∗ where ∗ is the canonical
star product on the NC plane Rd
θ while
fij is some given constant curvature and g is the gauge coupling constant. Local gauge
transformations are deﬁned as usual by

θ. Ai is a U (N ) gauge ﬁeld on the NC plane Rd

i = U ∗ Ai ∗ U +(x) − iU ∗ ∂iU + , F U
AU

(6.112)
U (x) are N×N star-unitary matrices, in other words U (x) is an element of U (N ) which
satisﬁes U ∗ U +(x) = U + ∗ U (x) = 1N .

ij = U ∗ Fij ∗ U +(x).

Classically the action (6.111) is minimized by gauge ﬁelds of non-zero topological
charge which on compact spaces are given by multi-valued functions. We need therefore
to deﬁne these gauge conﬁgurations of non-zero topological charge on the corresponding
covering spaces. Gauge ﬁeld on the NC torus T d
θ is thus the gauge ﬁeld Ai on the NC
space Rd

ˆj) = Ωa(x) ∗ Ai(x) ∗ Ω+

a (x) − iΩa(x) ∗ ∂iΩa(x)+.

(6.113)
If we try writing the N × N star-unitary transition functions Ωa, a = 1, ..., d, in the
inﬁnitesimal form Ωa(x) = 1 + iΛa(x) we can show that −i[Ai, Λa]∗ − ∂iΛa + O(Λ2) = 0 (
since the two points x and x + Σj
a ˆj) = Ai(x) ) . We
can immediately conclude that the functions Λa do not exist and hence (6.113) are called
global large gauge transformations. Furthermore, by computing Ai(x + Σj

the following two diﬀerent ways

a ˆj are identiﬁed we have Ai(x + Σj

Ωa(x) = eiαaixi ⊗ Γa

(6.117)
where Γa are constant SU (N ) matrices while αai is a d × d real matrix which represents
the U (1) factor of the U (N ) group. We will also assume that αai is chosen such that
(αΣ)T = −αΣ. The corresponding background gauge ﬁeld is introduced by

By using (6.117) and (6.118) it is a trivial exercise to show that (6.113) takes the form

By construction Qab, for a ﬁxed a and b, is quantized, i.e Qab ∈ Z. This can be seen
for example by taking the determinant of the two sides of the Weyl-’t Hooft algebra
(6.122). This quantization condition is a generic property of ﬂuxes on compact spaces
with non-contractible 2−cycles.

Now let us write the full gauge ﬁeld Ai as the sum of the non-trivial gauge solution
ai and a ﬂuctuation gauge ﬁeld Ai, viz Ai = ai + Ai. It is a straightforward exercise to
check that the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld Ai transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group. In particular under global large gauge transformations we have

We can then compute Fij = Fij + f∗
is given by Fij = DiAj − DjAi + i[Ai, Aj]∗ with the covariant derivative deﬁned by

we can immediately see that the action (6.111) becomes

(6.125)

(6.126)

This means in particular that the classical solutions of the model in terms of the ﬂuc-
tuation ﬁeld Ai are given by the condition of vanishing curvature, i.e Fij = 0. Hence
the requirement f∗
ij = fij is equivalent to the statement that the vacuum solution of the
action is given by Ai = 0. The ﬂuctuation gauge ﬁeld Ai has vanishing ﬂux and as a
consequence is a single-valued function on the torus.

symmetry group of the NC torus T d

Λ

will represent the automorphism symmetry group of the dual NC torus T d
(cid:48) .

It is a known result that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of d
a which solve the Weyl-’t Hooft algebra (6.132) is the requirement
divides the rank N of the gauge group, viz

The integer N/N0 is identiﬁed as the dimension of the irreducible representation of the
Weyl-’t Hooft algebra. As we will see shortly the integer N0 is the rank of the group of
matrices which commute with the twist eating solutions Γ0

6.5.5 Morita Equivalence

The ﬂuctuation gauge ﬁeld Ai corresponds to a Weyl operator ˆAi given by the map

(6.104), viz ˆAi =(cid:82) ddxAi(x) ⊗ ˆ∆(x). Similarly the global large gauge transformation Ωa
corresponds to the Weyl operator ˆΩa =(cid:82) ddxΩa(x) ⊗ ˆ∆(x). Hence, by using the identity

evi ˆ∂i ˆ∆(x)e−vi ˆ∂i = ˆ∆(x − v) for v ∈ Rd we can rewrite the constraints (6.124) as follows

product between the coordinate and operator representations. The Weyl operator ˆAi can
be expanded in an SU (N0)⊗SU (l1...l d

group of matrices which commute with the twist eating solutions Γ0
a. Thus we may write

The matrices Γa are given in terms of the twist eaters Γ0
is an N0 × N0 matrix-valued function which is periodic in (cid:126)j so that we have ai(k, ja) =
ai(k, ja + Lab) for each b = 1, ..., d. Therefore we have (j1, j2, ..., jd) ∼ (j1 + L1b, j2 +
L2b, ..., jd + Ldb) for each b = 1, ..., d. For example in two dimensions we can see ( by
using (6.143) ) that we have the result (Γ1)j1+L1b(Γ2)j2+L2b = (Γ1)j1(Γ2)j2 and hence
(j1, j2) ∼ (j1 + L1b, j2 + L2b).

By using Q = N M L−1 and QT = −Q we can rewrite this constraint as

(6.150)

(6.151)

Recalling the identity AL + BM = 1 we can immediately see that this last equation is
solved by the integers nb = maAab and jb = maBab. In terms of the momentum (cid:126)k the
solution ξa = mcL−1

ca reads ki = 2πmaβai with

β = −

Hence, the solution of equation (6.148)-or equivalently of the constraint(6.144)- when
ai(k,(cid:126)j) does not vanish is given by the Weyl operator (6.145) such that

ki = 2πmaβai , ja = mbBba ∀ ma∈Z.

(6.153)

For every ﬁxed set of d integers ma the solution for ki and ja is unique modulo L and
thus the Weyl operator ˆAi becomes (with ai( (cid:126)m) ≡ ai(2πmaβai, mbBba))

ΣL(L − ΘM )−1Σ−1 and hence 2πβθβT = −(L − ΘM )−1(L−1Θ)T . Finally, by using
AL + BM = 1 or equivalently AΘ + BM L−1Θ = L−1Θ and the fact that (BM L−1Θ)T =

The Traces T rρtA ⊗ tB and
T rρtA ⊗ tB ⊗ tC ⊗ tD

B.1 U(N) Lie Algebra and SU(N) Characters

U(N) Lie Algebra: The fundamental representation N of SU(N) is generated by the
Lie algebra of Gell-Mann matrices ta = λa/2, a = 1, ..., N 2−1. The canonical commutation
relations are

These matrices also satisfy

We also have

(B.9)

In this case the Fierz identity reads

(tA)jk(tA)li =

2

δjiδkl.

(B.10)

SU(N) Characters: The SU(N) characters in the representation ρ of the group are
given by the following traces

χρ,n(Λ) = T rρΛ ⊗ ... ⊗ Λ , n factors.

(B.11)

These are calculated for example in [203]. In this appendix, we will compute explicitly
the two traces T rρtA ⊗ tB and T rρtA ⊗ tB ⊗ tC ⊗ tD, and then deduce from them, the
characters T rρΛ ⊗ Λ and T rρΛ ⊗ Λ ⊗ Λ ⊗ Λ respectively.

The full trace T rtA1 ⊗ tA2... ⊗ tAn, n factors, is deﬁned by

T rtA1 ⊗ tA2.... ⊗ tA3 = (tA1)α1β1(tA2)α2β2...(tAn)αnβnδα1β1δα2β2...δαnβn.

(B.12)

The trace in the irreducible representation ρ is deﬁned by means of a projector P (s,t)
follows

n

as

T rρtA1 ⊗ tA2.... ⊗ tA3 = (tA1)α1β1(tA2)α2β2...(tAn)αnβnP (s,t)

(B.13)
The computation of this trace, ans as a consequence of the trace T rρΛ⊗Λ⊗...⊗Λ, requires
the computation of the projector P (s,t)
associated with the irreducible representation
ρ or equivalently (s, t). This calculation clearly involves the n−fold tensor product of
the fundamental representation. Thus, we consider all possible partitions {m} of n into
positive integers mi, where i = 1, ..s and m1 ≥ m2.. ≥ ms > 0, i.e.

δα1β1δα2β2...δαnβn.

n

n

n = m1 + ... + ms.

(B.14)

We call this partition a Young frame which consists of s rows with mi boxes in the ith
row. Obviously s ≤ n which corresponds to the complete anti-symmetrization of the
columns. In order to get a Young diagram we ﬁll out the boxes with numbers β1,...,βn,
where βi = 1, ..., n, such that entries are increasing along rows and columns. Let P be
the subset of the symmetric group Sn which permutes only the indices i of βi of each
row among themselves. Let Q be the subset of the symmetric group Sn which permutes
only the indices i of βi of each column among themselves. We deﬁne the so-called Young
symmetrizer by

sgn(q)ˆq

ˆp.

(B.15)

q∈Q

c(n){m} =

(cid:88)

MFT, Badis Ydri

259

The action of ˆq, which anti-symmetrizes the columns βi, and ˆp, which symmetrizes the
rows αi, are typically of the form

ˆqgα1β1...gαnβn = gα1βq(1)...gαnβq(n).

ˆpgα1β1...gαnβ2 = gαp(1)β1...gαp(n)βn.

(B.16)

(B.17)

An irreducible representation ρ corresponds to a Young tableau with s rows and t columns
which we denote m(s,t) or (s, t) for short. Note that t = m1. The projector P (s,t)
is the
projector onto the Hilbert subspace associated with the irreducible representation ρ. This
projector is proportional to the above Young symmetrizer [207]. We write

n

P (s,t)

n =

1

α(s,t)

c(n){m}.

The constant α is determined from the requirement P 2 = P .

B.2 The Trace T rρtA ⊗ tB
The full trace T rN 2tA ⊗ tB is deﬁned by

T rN 2tA ⊗ tB = (tA)α1β1(tB)α2β2δα1β1δα2β2.

The relevant tensor decomposition in this case is

A ⊗ B = A B ⊕ A
B

.

(B.19)

(B.20)

N ⊗ N =

N 2 + N

⊕ N 2 − N

.

2

2

(B.21)
In other words, we have an n−fold tensor product of the fundamental representation
with n = 2. We consider all possible partitions {m} of n = 2 into positive integers
mi as explained above. The symmetric irreducible representation corresponds to m(1,2),
while the antisymmetric irreducible representation corresponds to m(2,1). The symmetric
representation m(1,2) = (N ⊗ N )S corresponds to the partition m1 = 2, while the anti-
symmetric representation m(2,1) = (N ⊗ N )A corresponds to m1 = m2 = 1. The trace in
the irreducible representation ρ is deﬁned by means of a projector P (s,t)

as follows

2

T rρtA ⊗ tB = (tA)α1β1(tB)α2β2P (s,t)

2

δα1β1δα2β2.

This projector is proportional to the Young symmetrizer c(2){m}, viz

way.

Next we study the tensor product of four copies of the fundamental representation of

SU(N). We have
N ⊗ N ⊗ N ⊗ N = m(1,4) ⊕ m(2,3) ⊕ m(2,3) ⊕ m(2,3) ⊕ m(3,2) ⊕ m(3,2) ⊕ m(3,2) ⊕ m(2,2) ⊕ m(2,2) ⊕ m(4,1).

In terms of the highest weight (a1, a2, ..., aN−1) (usually this is written as (λ1, λ2, ..., λN )
with ai = λi − λi+1 and λN = 0) we have

(B.59)

In this case P = S3 and Q = S2. Now we have to be careful and symmetrize over rows
(the indices αi in the Kronecker delta symbols) and antisymmetrize over columns (the
indices βi in the Kronecker delta symbols)1. Explicitly we have

(2,3)δα1β1δα2β2δα3β3δα4β4 = (δα2β2δα3β3 + δα2β3δα3β2)(δα1β1δα4β4 − δα1β4δα4β1)

(B.60)

We can show that (c(4)
(2,3))2δα1β1δα2β2δα3β3δα4β4 = 8δα1β1δα2β2δα3β3δα4β4. This can also be
deduced from the result that (c(4)
