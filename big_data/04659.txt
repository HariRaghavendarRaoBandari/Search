Abstract

A small contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the air-ﬂuorescence yield in the
UV range is estimated based on an approach previously developed in the framework of the
radio-detection of showers in the gigahertz frequency range. First, this approach is shown to
provide an estimate of the main contribution of the ﬂuorescence yield due to the de-excitation
of the C 3Πu electronic level of nitrogen molecules to the B 3Πg one amounting to Y[337] =
(6.05 ± 1.50) MeV−1 at 800 hPa pressure and 293 K temperature conditions, which compares
well to previous dedicated works and to experimental results. Then, under the same pressure
and temperature conditions, the ﬂuorescence yield induced by molecular Bremsstrahlung ra-
[330−400] = 0.10 MeV−1 in the wavelength range of interest for the air-
diation is found to be Y MBR
ﬂuorescence detectors used to detect extensive air showers induced in the atmosphere by ultra-
high energy cosmic rays. This means that out of ≃ 175 photons with wavelength between 330
and 400 nm detected by ﬂuorescence detectors, one of them has been produced by molecular
Bremsstrahlung radiation. Although small, this contribution is not negligible in regards to the
total budget of systematic uncertainties when considering the absolute energy scale of ﬂuores-
cence detectors.

1. Introduction

Ultra-high energy cosmic rays can be efﬁciently observed by collecting the isotropic atmo-
spheric ﬂuorescence light emitted during dark nights by the extensive air showers that they
induce. This detection technique, pioneered by the Fly’s Eye experiment [1], was used by the
HiRes experiment [2] and is currently used at the Pierre Auger Observatory [3] and the Telescope
Array [4]. Fluorescence telescopes allow an accurate observation of the longitudinal proﬁle of
the showers. Based on the assumption that the ﬂuorescence intensity is proportional to the
electromagnetic energy deposited by the shower in the atmosphere, the ﬂuorescence detection
technique provides the opportunity of performing shower calorimetry by mapping the ioni-

sation content along the shower tracks. It is, as of today, the most direct way to measure the
primary energy on a nearly model-independent basis.

The various processes leading to the air-ﬂuorescence emission have been well investigated
theoretically in the recent years [5–7]. The atmospheric ﬂuorescence produced in an extensive
air shower is now known to be due mainly to the de-excitation of nitrogen molecules previously
excited by the numerous low-energy ionisation electrons left in the atmosphere after the pas-
sage of the electrons/positrons of the shower front. Low-energy ionisation electrons can in turn
produce their own emission through the molecular Bremsstrahlung process, as a consequence
of their collisions with nitrogen or oxygen targets. The corresponding radiation is expected to
occur over a wide range of frequencies; and the purpose of this work is to quantify the contribu-
tion of the molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the air-ﬂuorescence light emitted in the UV
wavelength range.

The general approach follows from previous works dedicated to the emission in the giga-
hertz frequency range [8, 9], applied here to the UV wavelength range. To start with, a compre-
hensive treatment of the time evolution of the distribution function describing the low-energy
ionisation electrons produced after the passage of high-energy electrons in air is presented in
section 2. From the knowledge of this distribution function, the ﬂuorescence yield expected
from the de-excitation of nitrogen molecules is estimated in section 3 and is shown to compare
favorably to the various measurements under 800 hPa pressure and 293 K temperature condi-
tions. Then, with the same pressure and temperature conditions, the application of the formal-
ism to the ﬂuorescence yield expected from molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation is presented in
section 4. In section 5, the same formalism is applied under pressure and temperature typical
of the standard parameterisation of the US atmosphere, so that the contribution of the molec-
ular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the ﬂuorescence yield can be probed in the relevant case of
extensive air showers. Finally, conclusions are given in section 6.

2. Production and Interactions of Low-Energy Ionisation Electrons

Throughout this study, the case of primary electrons with typical energy of a few tens of
mega-electron volts is considered. Upon the passage of such high-energy electrons in air, there
is roughly 2 MeV g−1 cm−2 of deposited energy per grammage unit mainly through the ionisa-
tion process. Hence, for one primary electron with energy Tp propagating over an inﬁnitesimal
distance dx in air, and for a mass density and average molar mass of dry air of target molecules
ρ and A, the average number of ionisation electrons per unit length and per kinetic energy band
can be estimated as

d2ne,i(Tp,T )

dx dT

ρN
A

=

σion(Tp)f0(Tp,T ).

(1)

The ionisation cross section σion(Tp) is considered identical for nitrogen or oxygen targets in
this study. f0(T ) stands for the normalised distribution in kinetic energy of the ionisation elec-
trons at their time of creation, f0(T ) ≡ f (T, t = 0). This distribution has been experimentally de-
termined and accurately parameterised for primary high-energy electrons with kinetic energies
up to several kilo-electron volts [10]. For higher kinetic energies Tp, relativistic effects as well
as close collisions giving rise to the emission of fast secondary electrons (knock-on electrons)
are known to modify the f distribution. To account for these effects, we adopt the analytical

expression provided in [6]:

f0(Tp,T ) =

8πZ R 2
y

m¡β(Tp)c¢2

1+C exp (−T /Tk)

T 2 + T 2

,

(2)

where c is the speed of light, m is the electron mass, β is the relativistic factor, Ry is the Rydberg
constant, T ranges from 0 to Tmax = (Tp− I0)/2 due to the indistinguishability between primary
and secondary electrons (with I0 the ionisation potential to create an electron-ion pair in air),
the constant C is determined in the same way as in [10] so that R dT f0(T ) reproduces the to-
tal ionisation cross section, Tk = 77 eV is a parameter acting as the boundary between close
and distant collisions, and T = 11.4 (15.2) eV for nitrogen (oxygen) [11]. In the energy range
of interest, this expression leads to 〈T〉 ≃ 40 eV, in agreement with the well-known stopping
power. It should be noted, however, that the above equation does not include all the relativistic
and exchange effects in the energy distribution of ionisation electrons [7], but these effects are
unimportant for a primary kinetic energy of 60 MeV assumed in this work.

The quantity given by equation 1 corresponds to the average number of secondary electrons
per length and per kinetic energy unit left just after the passage of one primary high-energy
electron in air. The same quantity available at any time t after the passage of one primary high-
energy electron is governed by the interactions that these electrons undergo in air. In turn, the
evolution in time of the left hand side of eqn. 1 can be fully encompassed in the time depen-
dence of the distribution in kinetic energy f (T, t ) of the ionisation electrons (note that, for con-
venience, we drop hereafter the Tp dependence). This evolution is determined by a Boltzmann
equation accounting for all the interactions of interest at work. Considering the ionisation as
quasi-static in space given the low energy of the electrons, it can be shown that the dominant
term governing the time evolution of f is the collision one [9]:

where σm
i denotes the cross sections of interest, namely ionisation, excitation of electronic lev-
els (including ro-vibrational excitation) and attachment processes for a molecule m. The three
ﬁrst terms in the right hand side stand for the disappearance of electrons with kinetic energy
T , while the two last terms stand for the appearance of electrons with kinetic energy T due to
ionisation and excitation reactions initiated by electrons with higher kinetic energy T ′. Note
that in the case of ionisation, a second electron emerges from the collision with kinetic energy
T ′ − T − I0.
All cross sections of interest for this study are taken from experimental tabulated data in [12]
and are shown in ﬁgure 1 as a function of the kinetic energy. For completeness, rates are shown
down to kinetic energies much lower than those relevant for the production of UV photons. Go-
ing down in energy, the main features of the different rates can be summarised in the following

3,000 ppm.

• For T ≥ 40 eV, ionisation on N2 and O2 molecules is the dominant process, causing energy

losses on a time scale below a picosecond.

• For 4 eV ≤ T ≤ 40 eV, excitation on electronic levels of N2 and O2 molecules is the domi-
nant process. The corresponding energy losses occur on time scales going from picosec-
onds to a few nanoseconds when going down in energy. To a smaller extent, there is a
disappearance of electrons through the three-body attachment process.

• For 1.7 eV ≤ T ≤ 4 eV, resonances for excitation on N2 and O2 molecules through ro-

vibrational processes cause energy losses on a time scale of the picosecond.

• For 0.2 eV ≤ T ≤ 1.7 eV:

– Resonances for excitation on N2 and O2 molecules through ro-vibrational processes
quantised in energies are visible through the peaks in continuous line. The corre-
sponding energy losses occur on a time scale of a few tens of picoseconds.

– Resonances for two-body attachment process on O2 molecules quantised in ener-
gies are visible through the peaks in dashed line. The corresponding time scale of
disappearance of the electrons is of the order of a nanosecond. This process is sub-
dominant compared to the previous one.

– For energies between the quantised ones where ro-vibrational and attachment pro-
cesses occur, energy losses on the small fractions of CO2 and H2O molecules are
important to consider. The corresponding energy losses occur on a time scale of
a nanosecond. Note that even if the abundance of Ar in air is larger than for CO2
and H2O molecules, the contribution of Ar molecules to the collision rate is negli-
gible because the corresponding energy losses occur at energies above 1 eV, where
collision rates due to N2 and O2 molecules are much more important.

Figure 2: The kinetic energy distribution function f (T, t ) in log10(eV−1) units, as a function of time and
kinetic energy.

• For T ≤ 0.2 eV, energy losses on CO2 and H2O molecules degrade electron energies down
to 0.1 eV, where the two-body attachment process make them disappearing on a time
scale of a few nanoseconds.

• Although the abundance of Ar in air is larger than for CO2 and H2O molecules, the corre-
sponding energy losses occur at energies above 1 eV, and are thus negligible compared to
the energy losses due to collision on N2 and O2 molecules in this energy range.

• Other processes such as Bremsstrahlung or recombination on O+2 ions have much smaller
rates, and they are negligible in determining the evolution with time of the kinetic energy
distribution of the electrons. Besides, at high energy, electrons can also lose energy in air
through K-shell ionisation and nuclear Bremsstrahlung, both processes yielding energetic
photons [6, 7]. These are however neglected in this study, since we assume that energy is
locally deposited in the medium.

To solve eqn. 3, a Monte-Carlo generator is used to simulate a large number of electrons
with initial energy randomly chosen according to f0(Tp,T ). All interactions are then simulated
according to the cross sections of interest, until the ﬁrst test electron and all secondary electrons
produced by ionisation get attached to oxygen molecules. This allows us to histogram f (T, t ) at
any time t . The solution for f is shown in ﬁgure 2 in a decimal logarithm scale under 800 hPa

pressure and 293 K temperature conditions, as a function of T and t . Dips at kinetic energies
corresponding to collision rates at quantised energies depicted in ﬁgure 1 are clearly seen. On a
time scale of 1 ns, almost all electron energies are already below the ionisation threshold. After
10 ns, the number of electrons with energies around 1 eV drops off to a large extent, due to
excitation reactions. Note that, given the different thresholds of the reactions to produce UV
photons, the phase space below 3 eV and above 10 ns will be irrelevant for the purpose of this
study.

Having determined the time evolution of the f distribution, the average number of ionisa-

tion electrons per unit length and per kinetic energy band can be estimated at any time as

Of particular interest for the following is to consider the number of electrons per unit time
and kinetic energy unit crossing any elementary sphere surface around the primary interac-
tion point. This is obtained by coupling equation 4 to the speed of the particles β(T )c and

3. Fluorescence Yield from Excitation of Nitrogen Molecules

In this section, the deposited ﬂux of low-energy ionisation electrons per unit time and ki-
netic energy unit estimated in the previous section is used to calculate ﬁrst the UV ﬂuores-
cence radiation emitted at 337 nm coming from the second positive system (2P) system of
N2 molecules, and then the total ﬂuorescence radiation emitted in the [330 − 400] nm wave-
length range. For comparison purpose, the energy of the primary electron is taken at an energy
corresponding to the electron-energy equivalent assigned to the AIRFLY measurement [13] for
120 GeV protons, namely Tp ≃ 60 MeV.
3.1. Fluorescence Yield from C 3Πu to B 3Πg Radiative Transition in N2

Through their collisions, ionisation electrons can excite nitrogen molecules in their ground
state X 3Σ+g to upper electronic states. Each electronic state is split into vibrational levels v . The
set of electronic transitions v − v′ between the level v of an upper electronic state and the level
v′ of a lower state is a particular band system. The band we are interested in here corresponds
to the vibrational levels (v, v′) = (0, 0) of the N2 C 3Πu → B 3Πg de-excitation, giving rise to the
production of 337 nm wavelength photons.
The number of excitations in the v = 0 vibrational level of the C 3Πu state per time and
length units is obtained by coupling equation 5 to the cross section for the excitation of C 3Πu
state, σC 3Πu (T ), in the following way:

νv=0
C 3Πu

(t ) =

ρN2

N

A Z dT φ1

e,i(T, t )qX→0σC 3Πu (T ),

(6)

where qX→0 is the Franck-Condon factor from the ground vibrational state (corresponding, ac-
cordingly to the Franck-Condon principle, to the overlap integral between the vibrational wave
functions of the ground state X and the upper level v = 0 [14]). Next, the rate of molecules that

6

may relax to a lower level v′ by emitting a v − v′ photon with an Av v′ probability per unit time
(the Einstein coefﬁcient) is obtained by multiplying equation 6 with the branching ratio B337 as-
sociated to the radiative transition from the vibrational level v = 0 of the electronic level C 3Πu
to the vibrational level v′ = 0 of the B 3Πg electronic level. Therefore, in the absence of other
transition processes apart from radiative ones, the ﬂuorescence yield per deposited energy unit
Y 0
337, where the subscript 0 stands for the absence of quenching effect (see below), is obtained
by dividing this rate by ρ(dE /dX )tot - the total deposited energy per unit length:

337 = B337 ×µ N
Y 0

A ¶2 cρN2 σion

(dE /dX )tot Z dtZ dT β(T )f (T, t )qX→0σC 3Πu (T ).

(7)

The integration time limit is arbitrary, but has to be greater than the time during which f is
non-zero in the kinetic energy range of interest.

It is to be noted that the combination of the ‘branching ratio‘ for excitation of the v = 0 vi-
brational level of the C 3Πu state given by the corresponding Franck-Condon factor from the
fundamental state and the (real) branching ratio for radiative decay from this upper level to the
v′ = 0 level of the lower state has a relatively high uncertainty. Interestingly, direct measure-
ments of the optical cross section σ337(T ) for the 337 nm band provide a direct way to infer the
product B337qX→0σC 3Πu (T ), within 15% of uncertainties. Therefore, the optical cross section as
reported in [16] is used in the following.
Finally, the effective ﬂuorescence yield Y337 is obtained by considering quenching effects,
due to non-radiative de-excitations through collisions with other molecules of the medium.
This quenching effect can be shown to be accounted for through the introduction of the so-
called Stern-Volmer correcting factor in the following way [6]:

Y337 = Y 0

337¡1+ P /P′337¢−1

.

(8)

The parameter P′337 is to be interpreted as the characteristic pressure accounting for the colli-
sional quenching.

The numerical result found for Y337 reads

Y337 = (6.05 ± 1.50) MeV−1.

(9)

To get this result, we have used (dE /dX )tot ≃ 2.35 MeV g−1 cm2 [15] and P′337 ≃ 15.9 hPa [13].
Note that the uncertainty of this result mainly comes from uncertainties in the optical cross
section, in the P′337 factor, in the cross sections for ionisation, excitation and attachment, and
in the energy spectrum of ionisation electrons at their creation time. Within the uncertainties,
this result for Y337 compares well to previous dedicated works [7] and to experimental results
under the same pressure and temperature conditions, as shown in ﬁgure 3. The experimental
results presented in this ﬁgure, as reported in [7], have been corrected for pressure, temperature
and humidity effects, so that comparisons are sensible. The obtained world average value is
〈Y337〉 = (7.04± 0.24) MeV−1.
3.2. Fluorescence Yield in the [330− 400] nm Wavelength Band

The 337 nm radiative transition is the dominant process contributing the air-ﬂuorescence,
but other radiative transitions enter into play in the wavelength band of interest. Considering
the efﬁciency of the ﬂuorescence telescopes as roughly rectangle functions between 330 nm
and 400 nm, the ﬂuorescence yield for this wavelength interval can be found by dividing Y337

with the ratio of the ﬂuorescence emission. The ﬂuorescence emission ratio is the ﬂuorescence
emission I337 at wavelength λ = 337 nm, to the ﬂuorescence emission for the desired wave-
length interval ∆λ= [330−400] nm. The ﬂuorescence emission factors can be obtained from the
measured intensities reported in [13], leading to Y[330−400] ≃ 17.6 MeV−1. This is the relevant ﬁg-
ure to which the contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the ﬂuorescence yield
estimated in next section in this wavelength interval has to be compared.

4. Fluorescence Yield from Molecular Bremsstrahlung Radiation

Through their collisions, ionisation electrons can produce their own emission through the
molecular Bremsstrahlung process. The production of photons with energies hν, with h the
Planck constant and ν the frequency, corresponds to transitions between unquantised energy
states of the electrons. Screening effects prevent quantitative calculations of the Bremsstrahlung
cross section without approximations which depend on the kinetic energy of the electron and
on the emitted energy of the photon. For T up to a few tens of electron volts, screening effects
are important and the differential cross section dσMBR/dν is well described by the following
expression obtained in [17]:

where α is the ﬁne-structure constant, Ry the Rydberg constant and σm the electron transfer

emission resulting from this process is isotropic.

The corresponding contribution to the ﬂuorescence yield can be estimated in the same way
as in the previous section, by plugging in the Bremsstrahlung cross section instead of the optical
one and by integrating over the relevant frequency range. This leads to the following expression:

(11)

Note that, to restrict to a compact expression for convenience, the differences in the momen-
tum transfer cross section for nitrogen and oxygen target molecules have been omitted in this
expression. The actual calculation splits this equation into two terms, weighted by the densities
of nitrogen and oxygen. Once integrations are carried out, the obtained result is

Y MBR
[330−400] = 1.0× 10−1 MeV−1.

(12)

Hence, compared to Y[330−400], it turns out that molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation contributes
≃ 0.5% to the ﬂuorescence yield. This is a quite small contribution, which nevertheless is not
negligible in regards of the total budget of current systematic uncertainties to consider for the
absolute energy scale of the ﬂuorescence detector [19].

5. Application to Extensive Air Showers

The contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the ﬂuorescence yield obtained
in previous sections applies at speciﬁc pressure and temperature conditions, namely 800 hPa
and 293 K. The effect is expected to depend on these conditions, since both equations 7 and 11
are explicitly dependent on the density ρ, and the quenching factor P′337 is also dependent on
pressure and temperature. To probe the effect in the case of extensive air showers, it is thus
interesting to repeat the calculations in different pressure and temperature conditions.

9

To this aim, the ratio Y MBR

[330−400]/Y[330−400] is shown in ﬁgure 4 as a function of the altitude

above sea level in the US standard atmosphere, atmosphere parameterised from experimental
data reported in [18]. The quenching factor is estimated using the temperature dependence

of the P′337 parameter derived in [13], namely P′337(T ) = P′337(293 K)pT /293 K. The energy of

primary electrons is taken here to be 25 MeV, a typical value for electrons/positrons in the elec-
tromagnetic cascade of an extensive air shower. Consequently, the values for (dE /dX )tot and
σion are here adapted for Tp = 25 MeV. Besides, it is to be noted that the f distribution function
encompasses an intrinsic dependence on density, since the interaction rates governing the time
dependence of this function are proportional to the density. As a result, this dependence inﬂu-
ences to some extent the expected decreases of the yields estimated from equations 7 and 11
with density. The obtained ratio Y MBR
[330−400]/Y[330−400] varies hence from ≃ 8× 10−3 at altitude sea
level to ≃ 2.5× 10−3 at ten kilometers above sea level. Note that the value obtained here for a
pressure of 800 hPa (around four kilometers above sea level) differs from the reference value
obtained in the previous sections due to the different temperature in the atmospheric proﬁle
used here (≃ 260 K four kilometers above sea level).

6. Conclusions

In this study, the contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the ﬂuorescence
yield has been presented, based on a general approach that follows from previous works dedi-
cated to the emission in the gigahertz frequency range. Applied to the de-excitation processes
in N2 molecules leading to the ﬂuorescence emission in the UV range, the approach is shown
to reproduce the main features of the ﬂuorescence emission in air. Applied to the molecu-
lar Bremsstrahlung radiation of the low-energy ionisation electrons, the approach provides the
estimate that this process contributes ≃ 0.5% to the ﬂuorescence yield in the [330 − 400] nm
wavelength range under 800 hPa pressure and 293 K temperature conditions. This means that
out of ≃ 175 photons with wavelength between 330 and 400 nm detected by the ﬂuorescence
detectors, one of them has been produced by molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation.

Hence, not surprisingly since the emission induced by de-excitation processes is known to
reproduce the main features of the ﬂuorescence, the contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung
radiation to the ﬂuorescence yield appears as a small one. It is however to be noted that this
contribution is of the same order of magnitude as other sources of systematic uncertainties to
consider for the absolute energy scale of ﬂuorescence detectors.
