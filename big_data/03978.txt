Abstract. Let t and k be a positive integers, and let Ik = {i ∈ Z : −k ≤ i ≤ k}. Let
t(Ik) be the smallest positive integer ℓ such that every zero-sum sequence S over Ik
of length |S| ≥ ℓ contains a zero-sum subsequence of length t. If no such ℓ exists, then
let s

t(Ik) = ∞.

In this paper, we prove that s

t(Ik) is ﬁnite if and only if every integer in [1, D(Ik)]
divides t, where D(Ik) = max{2, 2k − 1} is the Davenport constant of Ik. Moreover,
t(Ik) ≤ t + (2k − 2)(2k − 3). We
we prove that if s
t(Ik) = t + k(k − 1) holds for k ≤ 3 and conjecture that this equality
also show that s
holds for any k ≥ 1.

1. Introduction and Main results

We shall follow the notation in [17], by Grynkiewicz. Let N be the set of positive
integers. Let G0 a subset of an abelian group G. A sequence over G0 is an unordered list
of terms in G0, where repetition is allowed. The set of all sequences over G0 is denoted
by F (G0) A sequence with no term is called trivial or empty. If S is a sequence with
terms si, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we write S = s1 · . . . · sn = Qn
i=1 si. We say that R is a subsequence
of S if any term in R is in S. If R and T are subsequences of S such that S = R · T , then
R is the complementary sequence of T in S, and vice versa. We also write T = S · R−1
and R = S · T −1. For every sequence S = s1 · . . . · sn over G0,

• −S = (−s1) · . . . · (−sn)
• the length of S is |S| = n;
• the sum of S is σ(S) = s1 + s2 + . . . + sn;
• the subsequence-sum of S is Σ(S) = {σ(R) : R is a subsequence of S}.

For any sequence R over G0 and any integer d ≥ 0,

R[0] is the trivial sequence, and R[d] = R · . . . · R

A sequence with sum 0 is called zero-sum. The set of all zero-sum sequences over

a proper zero-sum subsequence. The Davenport constant of G0, denoted by D(G0) is
the maximum length of a minimal zero-sum sequence over G0. The research on zero-
sum theory is quite extensive when G is a ﬁnite abelian groups (e.g., see [4, 7, 9, 10]
and the references therein). However, there is less activity when G is inﬁnite (e.g.,
see [1, 5] and the references therein). The study of the particular case G = Zr was
explicitly suggested by Baeth and Geroldinger [2] due to their relevance to direct-sum
decompositions of modules. In a recent paper, Baeth et al. [3] studied the Davenport
constant of G0 ⊆ Zr. The Davenport constant of an interval in Z was ﬁrst derived (see
Theorem 1) by Lambert [15] (also see [6, 19, 20] for related work.) In a recent paper,
Plagne and Tringali [16], studied the Davenport constant of the cartesian product of
intervals of Z.

For any integers x and y with x ≤ y, let [x, y] = {i ∈ Z : x ≤ i ≤ y}. For k ∈ N, let

Ik = [−k, k].

Theorem 1 (Lambert [15]). D(Ik) = max{2, 2k − 1} for any k ∈ N.

For G ﬁnite and G0 ⊆ G, let st(G0) be the smallest integer ℓ such that any sequence
S ∈ F (G0) of length |S| ≥ ℓ contains a zero-sum subsequence of length t. If t = exp(G),
then st(G0) is called the Erd¨os–Ginzburg–Ziv constant and is denoted by s(G).
In
1961, Erd¨os–Ginzburg–Ziv [7] proved that s(Zn) = 2n − 1. Reiher [18] proved that
s(Zp ⊕ Zp) = 4p − 3 for any prime p. In general, if G has rank two, say G = Zn1 ⊕ Zn2
with 1 ≤ n1 | n2, then s(G) = 2n1 + 2n2 − 3 (see Theorem 5.8.3 in Geroldinger–Halter–
Koch [11]). For groups of higher rank, we refer the reader to Fan–Gao–Zhong [8]. More
recently, Gao et al [13] proved that for any integer k ≥ 2 and any ﬁnite G with exponent
n = exp(G), if the diﬀerence n − |G|/n is large enough, then skn(G) = kn + D(G) − 1.
Observe that if G is torsion-free and G0 ⊆ G, then for any nonzero g ∈ G0 and for
any d ∈ N, the sequence g[d] ∈ F (G0) does not contain a zero-sum subsequence. Thus,
we will work with the following analogue of st(G0).
Deﬁnition 2. 1 For any subset G0 ⊆ G, let s′
t(G0) be the smallest positive integer ℓ
such that any sequence S ∈ B(G0) of length |S| ≥ ℓ contains a zero-sum subsequence of
length t. If no such ℓ exists, then let s′

t(G0) = ∞.

If t = exp(G) is ﬁnite, then we denote st(G0) by s(G). Let r ∈ N and assume that
G ∼= Zr

not admit a zero-sum subsequence has the form S = T [n−1] for some T ∈ F (G). Zhong

for their proofs).

Conjecture 6. Corollary 1 holds for any k ∈ N.

2. Proofs of the main results

For any integers a and b, we denote gcd(a, b) by (a, b). We use the abbreviations
z.s.s and z.s.sb for zero-sum sequence(s) and zero-sum subsequence(s), respectively. The
letters k and t will denote positive integers throughout the paper.

The following lemma gives a lower bound for s′

t(Ik).

Lemma 7. Consider the z.s.s U = k · (−1)[k] and V = (k − 1) · (−1)[k−1]. Then,
S = U [
k −1] are z.s.s that do not contain a z.s.sb of length
t. Thus, s′

k+1 −1] · V [k] and R = U [k−1] · V [ t

t(Ik) ≥ t + k(k − 1).

t

Proof. We prove the lemma for S only since the proof for R is similar. By contradiction,
assume that S contains a z.s.sb of length t. Since σ(S) = 0, it follows that S also
contains a z.s.sb S′ of length |S| − t = k(k − 1) − 1. Moreover, S′ can be written as
S′ = k[a] · (k − 1)[b] · (−1)[c] for some nonnegative integers a, b, and c. Hence σ(S′) =
ak + b(k − 1) − c = 0 and a + b + c = |S′| = k2 − k − 1. Thus

(a + 1)(k + 1) = k(k − b).

Since a, b, k ≥ 0, we have 0 < k − b ≤ k. Since (k, k + 1) = 1, we obtain that k + 1
divides k − b, which is a contradiction. Thus s′
(cid:3)

t(Ik) ≥ |S| + 1 = t + k(k − 1).

Example 8. For k = 3, S = (3 · −1 · −1 · −1)[14] · (2 · −1 · −1)[3] is a z.s.s of length 65
over [−3, 3] which does not contain a z.s.sb of length t = 60.

Lemma 10. If s′

t(Ik) is ﬁnite, then every odd integer in [1, D(Ik)] divides t.

Proof. Since the lemma is trivial for k = 1, we assume that k ≥ 2. Then D(Ik) = 2k − 1
by Theorem 1. Let ℓ = 2c − 1 be an odd integer in [3, D(Ik)], and consider the minimal
z.s.s S = c[c−1] · (−c + 1)[c]. Then, for any x ∈ N, it follows from Lemma 9 that for
any z.s.sb R of S[x], |R| divides |S| = 2c − 1 = ℓ. Since ℓ does not divide t, there is no
z.s.sb of S[x] whose length is equal to t. Since x is arbitrary, it follows that s′
t(Ik) can be
arbitrarily large. This proves the lemma.
(cid:3)

To prove the upper bound in Theorem 5(ii), we will use the following lemma which is a
directly application a well-known fact: “Any sequence of n integers contains a nonempty
subsequence whose sum is divisible by n”.

Lemma 11. Let β ∈ N and X ∈ F (Z). If |X| ≥ β, then there exists a factorization
X = X0 · X1 · . . . · Xr such that

(i) |X0| ≤ β − 1 and no subsequence of X0 has a sum that is divisible by β.
(ii) |Xj| ≤ β and σ(Xj) is divisible by β for any j ∈ [1, r].

We will also use the following lemmas.

Lemma 12. Assume that k ≥ 2 and that every integer in [1, D(Ik)] divides t. Let S be
a z.s.s over Ik = [−k, k] that does not contain a z.s.sb of length t. Let S = S1 · . . . · Sh be
a factorization of S into minimal z.s.sb Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ h. If |S| ≥ t + k(k − 1), then there
exists some length β such that nβ = |{Si : |Si| = β, 1 ≤ i ≤ h}| satisﬁes:

nβ > (2k − 2)(2k − 3).

Proof. Recall that (a, b) denotes gcd(a, b). It is easy to see that

(2)

(2k − 3, 2k − 2) = (2k − 2, 2k − 1) = (2k − 3, 2k − 1) = 1.

Since k > 1 and every integer in [1, D(Ik)] = [1, 2k − 1] is a factor of t, it follows
from (2) that t = p(2k − 1)(2k − 2)(2k − 3), for some p ∈ N. By deﬁnition, we have

Lemma 13. Assume that k ≥ 2 and that every integer in [1, D(Ik)] divides t. Let S be
a z.s.s over Ik = [−k, k] of length |S| ≥ t + k(k − 1) such that S does not contain a z.s.sb
of length t. Let S = S1 · . . . · Sh be a factorization of S into minimal z.s.sb Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ h.
Let L = {|Si| : 1 ≤ i ≤ h}, α = maxℓ∈L ℓ, and let nℓ = |{Si :

|Si| = ℓ, 1 ≤ i ≤ h}|.

If there exists β ∈ L such that nβ ≥ α − 1, then

|S| ≤ t − β + (β − 1) max
ℓ∈L\{α}

ℓ.

Remark 14. By Lemma 12, there exists β ∈ L such that nβ > (2k − 2)(2k − 3).
Moreover, α = maxℓ∈L ℓ ≤ D(Ik) ≤ (2k − 2)(2k − 3) + 1 for k ≥ 2. Thus, nβ ≥ α, i.e.,
the hypothesis of Lemma 13 always holds.

Proof. Given a factorization S = S1 · . . . · Sh into minimal z.s.s Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ h, consider
the sequence of lengths in L \ {α}:

X =

h

Y

i=1,|Si|6=α

|Si| = Y

ℓ∈L\{α}

ℓ[nℓ].

By hypothesis, there exists β ∈ L such that, for all ℓ ∈ L \ {α}, we have nβ ≥ α − 1. It
follows from Lemma 11 that there exists a factorization X = X0 · X1 . . . Xr such that
(3)

|X0| ≤ β − 1, and no subsequence X0 has a sum that is divisible by β.

(4)

Thus,

(5)

|Xj| ≤ β and β divides σ(Xj) for all j ∈ [1, r].

σ(Xj) = Px∈Xj

x ≤ |Xj| · max
x∈Xj

x ≤ βα for all j ∈ [1, r].

Note that (4), (5), and the hypothesis on β imply that:

β divides t; nβ ≥ α − 1; σ(Xj) ≤ αβ; and β divides σ(Xj) for all j ∈ [1, r].

Thus, if

Then S would contain a z.s.s of length t obtained by concatenating n′

the hypothesis of the theorem. Thus, βnβ +Pr

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 5. We ﬁrst prove part (i). Suppose that s′
t(Ik) is ﬁnite. Then it follows
from Lemma 10 that every odd integer in [1, D(Ik)] divides t. Thus, it remains to show
that if a is an even integer in [1, D(Ik)], then a divides t.
Case 1: a = 2e for some integer e ≥ 1.

Lemma 9 implies that for any p ∈ N, the sequence S = (1 · −1)[p] is a z.s.s whose
z.s.sb have lengths that are multiples of 2. Therefore,
if 2 does not divide t, then
s′
t(Ik) ≥ |S| = 2p, where p can be chosen to be arbitrarily large. Thus, 2 divides t if
s′
t(Ik) is ﬁnite.

Now assume that e > 1. Since the gcd of two numbers divides their diﬀerence,
(a/2 − 1, a/2 + 1) ≤ 2. But 2 does not divide a/2 − 1 or a/2 + 1; and so (a/2 −
1, a/2 + 1) = 1. Lemma 10 implies that for any p ∈ N, the sequence S[p] with S =
(a/2 − 1)[a/2+1] · (−a/2 − 1)[a/2−1] is a z.s.s whose z.s.sb have lengths that are multiples of
|S| = (a/2 + 1) + (a/2 − 1) = a. Thus, if a does not divide t, we can obtain arbitrarily
long z.s.s over Ik = [−k, k] that do not contain z.s.sb of length t, because p can be chosen
to be arbitrarily large. Thus, a divides t if s′
Case 2: a is not a power of 2.

t(Ik) is ﬁnite.

Then a = 2ej, where e and j are nonnegative integers such that j is odd. By
Lemma 10, j divides t, and if follows from Case 1 that 2e divides t. Since j is odd,
(2e, j) = 1. Since 2e and j are factors of t, it follows that 2ej divides t.

Thus, it follows from Case 1, Case 2, and Lemma 10 that every integer in [1, D(Ik)]

divides t.

Since the lower bound of s′

t(It) in Theorem 5(ii) follows from Lemma 7, it remains to
prove its upper bound. Let k, t ∈ N be such that every integer in [1, D(Ik)] divides t. In
particular, t is even. Let S be an arbitrary z.s.s over Ik = [−k, k] that does not contain
a z.s.sb of length t.

If k = 1, then it follows from Theorem 1 that D(Ik) = 2. Thus, 2 divides t and
|S| = x1 + 2x2 for some nonnegative integers x1 and x2. If |S| ≥ t, then x1 ≥ 2 or
x2 ≥ t/2 (because t is even). This implies that there exit nonnegative integers x′
1 ≤ x1
and x′
1] is a z.s.sb of S of length t,
which contradicts the fact that S does not contain a z.s.s of length t. Hence |S| ≤ t − 1,
and s′

2 = t. Thus S′ = (1 · −1)[x′

t(Ik) ≤ |S| + 1 = t.

2 ≤ x2 such that x′

Now assume k ≥ 2. Since S was arbitrarily chosen, it follows that if |S| ≤ t + k(k −

1) − 1, then

′
t(Ik) ≤ |S| + 1 ≤ t + k(k − 1) ≤ t + (2k − 2)(2k − 3),
s

and the upper bound in Theorem 5(ii) follows. So we may assume that |S| ≥ t+k(k −1).
Let S = S1·. . .·Sh be a factorization of S into minimal z.s.sb . Let L = {|Si| : 1 ≤ i ≤ h},
α = maxℓ∈L ℓ, and let nℓ = |{Si :
|Si| = ℓ, 1 ≤ i ≤ h}. Then Remark 14 implies that
there exists β ∈ L is such that nβ ≥ α − 1 for all ℓ ∈ L \ {α}. Thus, Lemma 13 (where
we considered β = α and 1 ≤ β ≤ α − 1) yields

|S| ≤ t − α + (α − 1)2 ≤ t − (2k − 1) + (2k − 2)2,

where we used the fact α ≤ D(Ik) = 2k − 1. Since S was chosen to be an arbitrary z.s.s
over Ik = [−k, k] which does not contain a z.s.sb of length t, it follows that

t(Ik) ≤ |S| + 1 ≤ t − (2k − 1) + (2k − 2)2 + 1 = t + (2k − 2)(2k − 3).

(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 1. For k ∈ {1, 2}, the corollary holds since the upper and lower
bounds of s′

t(Ik) given by Theorem 5 are both equal to t + k(k − 1).

For k = 3, it also follows from Theorem 5 that t+ 6 ≤ s′

t(I3) ≤ t+ 12. Thus, it remains
to show that if S is an arbitrary z.s.s over I3 which does not contain a z.s.s of length t,
then |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

Consider a factorization S = S1 · . . . · Sh into minimal z.s.s Si, i ∈ [1, h]. Let L =
|Si| = ℓ, 1 ≤ i ≤ h}|. Thus,

{|Si| : 1 ≤ i ≤ h}, α = maxℓ∈L ℓ, and let nℓ = |{Si :
α ≤ D(I3) = 5. If α ≤ 4, then Lemma 13 yields

|S| ≤ t + max

1≤α≤4(cid:0)(α − 1)2 − α(cid:1) = t + (4 − 1)2 − 4 = t + 5.

Thus, we may assume that α = max
ℓ∈L

ℓ = 5 for any factorization of S.

If β ∈ {1, 2} and nβ ≥ 4, then Lemma 13 yields

|S| ≤ t + max
β∈{1,2}

((β − 1)α − β) = t + (2 − 1)5 − 2 = t + 3.

Next, suppose that R is a z.s.sb of S with length at least 4. Then R · −R can be
trivially factorize into |W | ≥ 4 z.s.s of length 2. This would yields a new factorization

h with n2 ≥ 4 ≥ n5 − 1, which would imply that |S| < t + 5 by the above

Also note that if nℓ ≥ t/ℓ holds for some length ℓ ∈ L, then we obtain a z.s.sb of S of
length t by concatenating t/ℓ z.s.sb of length ℓ in S. This would contradict the deﬁnition
of S. Thus, we can assume that nℓ ≤ t/ℓ − 1 for all ℓ ∈ L ⊆ [1, 5].
To recapitulate, we may assume that for any factorization S = S1 · . . . · Sh, with
SL = Qh

|Si| = ℓ, 1 ≤ i ≤ h}|, we have:

i=1 |Si| and nℓ = |{Si :

(i) SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 3[n3] · 2[n2] · 1[n1], where 0 ≤ nℓ ≤ t/ℓ − 1 for ℓ ∈ [1, 5]; n5 ≥ 1;

(ii) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the subsequences S′

L of SL and

and n1, n2 ≤ 3.

the z.s.s S′ of S of length σ(S′

L).

(iii) If R is z.s.s over I3 such that |R| ≥ 4, then R and −R cannot both be subse-

quences of S.

(iv) If R is a minimal z.s.sb of S such that |R| = 5, then R = 3[2] · (−2)[3].

(This follows from (iii) and the fact A = 3[2]·(−2)[3] and −A are the only minimal
z.s.s of length 5 over I3 = [−3, 3]. Thus, if −A is the z.s.sb of S, then we can
analyze −S instead of S.)

We now prove the following claims.

Claim 1: If 5 · 3[4] is a subsequence of SL, then |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11]

If n4 + n2 + n1 ≥ 1, then either 5 · 4 · 3[4], or 5 · 3[4] · 2, or 5 · 3[4] · 1 is a subsequence of SL,
which implies that Σ(SL) contains all the integers in [6, 11]. Thus, n4 = n2 = n1 = 0,
which implies that SL = 5[n5] · 3[n3]. If n5 ≤ 1, then

|S| = σ(SL) = 5n5 + 3n3 ≤ 5 + 3(t/3 − 1) < t + 5.

Thus, we may assume that

Then Σ(SL) contain all the integers in [6, 11]\{7}; and so |S| 6= t+d for d ∈ [6, 11]\{7}.

SL = 5[n5] · 3[n3], where n5 ≥ 2 and n3 ≥ 4.

It remains to show that |S| 6= t + 7.

Note that the only minimal z.s.s of length 3 over [−3, 3] are (up to sign) B1 = 2·(−1)[2]
and B2 = 3 · −2 · −1. Since 5 · 3[4] is a subsequence of SL, it follows from the assumptions
(i)–(iv) (see above) that S′ = A·X ·Y ·Z ·W is a subsequence of S, where A = 3[2] ·(−2)[3]
and X, Y, Z, W ∈ {−B1, B1, −B2, B2}. By inspecting the sequence S′ for all possible
choices of X, Y , Z, and W ; we see that S′ admits a z.s.s of length 7. For instance, if
X = Y = Z = B2, then

S′ = A · B[3]

· W = A[2] · 3 · (−1)[3] · W

contains the subsequence 3 · (−1)[3] · W , which is a z.s.s of length 4 + |W | = 7. Hence,
|S| 6= t + 7. Thus, |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

Claim 2: If 5 · 4[2] · 3 is a subsequence of SL, then |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

AVOIDING ZERO-SUM SUBSEQUENCES OF PRESCRIBED LENGTH OVER THE INTEGERS

If n3 ≥ 2, or n2 ≥ 1, or n1 ≥ 1, then either 5 · 4[2] · 3[2], or 5 · 4[2] · 3 · 2, or 5 · 4[2] · 3 · 1 is a
subsequence of SL, which implies that Σ(SL) contains all the integers in [6, 11]. In these
cases, |S| 6= t + d for d ∈ [6, 11], we are done. Thus, we may assume that n2 = n1 = 0
and n3 = 1, which implies that SL = 5[n5] · 4[n3] · 3. If n5 ≤ 1, then

|S| = σ(SL) = 5n5 + 4n4 + 3 ≤ 5 + 4(t/4 − 1) + 3 < t + 5.

Thus, we may assume that

SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 3, where n5 ≥ 2 and n4 ≥ 2.

Thus, 5[2] · 4[2] · 3 is a subsequence of SL, which implies that Σ(SL) contain all the
integers in [7, 11]. Thus |S| 6= t + d for d ∈ [7, 11]. It remains to show that |S| 6= t + 6.
Note that the only minimal z.s.s of length 4 over [−3, 3] are (up to sign) C1 = 3·(−1)[3]
and C2 = 3 · 1 · (−2)[2]. Since 5 · 4[2] · 3 is a subsequence of SL, it follows from the
assumptions (i)–(iv) that S′ = A · X · Y · Z is a subsequence of S, where A = 3[2] · (−2)[3],
X, Y ∈ {−C1, C1, −C2, C2}, and Z ∈ {−B1, B1, −B2, B2}. By inspecting the sequence
S′ for all possible choices of X, Y , and Z; we see that S′ admits a z.s.s of length 6. For
instance, if X = C1 and Y = C2, then

S′ = A · C1 · C2 · Z = A · (3 · −1 · −2)[2] · (1 · −1) · Z

contains the subsequence (3 · −1 · −2) · Z, which is a z.s.sb of length 3 + |Z| = 6. Hence,
|S| 6= t + 6. Thus, |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

Claim 3: If 5 · 4[3] is a subsequence of SL, then |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

If n3 ≥ 1, then 5 · 4[2] · 3 is a subsequence of SL, and we are back in Case 2. Thus, we
may assume that n3 = 0. If n2 ≥ 1 or n1 ≥ 2, then either 5 · 4[3] · 2 or 5 · 4[3] · 1[2] is a
subsequence of SL, which implies that Σ(SL) contains all the integers in [6, 11]. Thus, S
contains z.s.sb of length ℓ for all ℓ ∈ [6, 11]. Hence, |S| 6= t + d for d ∈ [6, 11]. Thus, we
may assume that n2 = 0 and n1 ≤ 1. Thus, SL = 5[n5] · 4[n3] · 1[n1]. Moreover, if n5 ≤ 1,
then

|S| = σ(SL) = 5n5 + 4n4 + n1 ≤ 5 + 4(t/4 − 1) + 1 < t + 5.

Thus, we may assume that

SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 1[n1], where n5 ≥ 2, n4 ≥ 3, and n1 ≤ 1.

Since 5[2] · 4[3] is a subsequences of SL, it follows that Σ(SL) contain all the integers
in [8, 10]. Thus, S admits z.s.s of length ℓ for all ℓ ∈ [8, 10]. Hence, |S| 6= t + d for all
d ∈ [8, 10]. Moreover, it follows from the assumptions (i)–(iv) that S′ = A · X · Y · Z
is a subsequence of S, where A = 3[2] · (−2)[3] and X, Y, Z ∈ {−C1, C1, −C2, C2}. By
inspecting the sequence S′ for all possible choices of X, Y , and Z; we see that S′ admits
a z.s.s of length 7. Hence, |S| 6= t + 7. Overall, we obtain |S| 6= t + d for any d ∈ [7, 10].
If 5 · 4[4] is a subsequence of SL, it again follows from the assumptions (i)–(iv) that
S′ = A · X · Y · Z · W is a subsequence of S, where A = 3[2] · (−2)[3] and X, Y, Z, W ∈
{−C1, C1, −C2, C2}. By inspecting the sequence S′ for all possible choices of X, Y , Z,
and W ; we see that S′ admits z.s.s of lengths 6 and 11. In this case, |S| 6= t + d for all
d ∈ [6, 11]. Thus, we may assume that

Now, it remains to show that |S| 6= t + a for a ∈ {6, 11}. However, if |S| = t + a, then

SL = 5[n5] · 4[3] · 1[n1], where n5 ≥ 2 and n1 ≤ 1.

5n5 + 4(3) + n1 = σ(SL) = |S| = t + a ⇒ 5n5 = t + a − 12 − n1.

This is a contradiction since 5 divides t (by hypothesis) and 5 does not divide a − 12 − n1
for a ∈ {6, 11} and n1 ∈ {0, 1}. Thus, |S| 6= t + d for all d ∈ [6, 11].

Based on Claim 1–Claim 3, we may assume the following:
(v) SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 3[n3] · 2[n2] · 1[n1], where 0 ≤ nℓ ≤ t/ℓ − 1 for all ℓ ∈ [1, 5];

n1, n2, n3 ≤ 3; n4 ≤ 2; (n4, n3) 6= (2, 1); and n5 ≥ 1.

We will use this assumption in the following cases.

Case 1: |S| 6= t + 6.

Assume that |S| = t + 6. If n1 ≥ 1, then 5 · 1 is a subsequence of SL, which implies
that S contains a z.s.sb of length 5 + 1 = 6 whose complementary sequence in S is a
z.s.sb of length t. Thus, n1 = 0. By a similar reasoning, we infer that the following
conditions hold: n3 ≤ 1; and n4 ≥ 1 ⇒ n2 = 0. Moreover, it follows from condition (v)
that (n4, n3) 6= (2, 1). Consequently, either SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 3[n3] with n3 ≤ 1, n4 ≤ 2,
and (n4, n3) 6= (2, 1); or SL = 5[n5] · 3[n3] · 2[n2] with n3 ≤ 1 and n2 ≤ 2. Thus,

|S| = σ(SL) ≤ 5n5 + 8 ≤ 5(t/5 − 1) + 8 < t + 6,

which is a contradiction. Thus, |S| 6= t + 6.

Case 2: |S| 6= t + 7.

Assume that |S| = t + 7. If n2 ≥ 1, then 5 · 2 is a subsequence of SL, which implies
that S contains a z.s.sb of length 5 + 2 = 7 whose complementary sequence in S is a
z.s.sb of length t. Thus, n2 = 0. By a similar reasoning, we infer that the following
conditions hold: n1 ≤ 1; n4 ≥ 1 ⇒ n3 = 0; n3 ≥ 1 ⇒ n4 = 0; and n3 ≥ 2 ⇒ n1 = 0.
Consequently, either SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] · 1[n1] with n4 ≤ 2 and n1 ≤ 1; or SL = 5[n5] · 3 · 1,
or SL = 5[n5] · 3[n3] with n3 ≤ 3. Thus,

|S| = σ(SL) ≤ 5n5 + 9 ≤ 5(t/5 − 1) + 9 < t + 7,

which is a contradiction. Thus |S| 6= t + 7.

Case 3: |S| 6= t + 8.

Assume that |S| = t + 8. If n3 ≥ 1, then 5 · 3 is a subsequence of SL, which implies
that S contains a z.s.sb of length 5 + 3 = 8 whose complementary sequence in S is a
z.s.sb of length t. Thus, n3 = 0. By a similar reasoning, we infer that n4 ≤ 1; n2 ≤ 3;
n1 ≤ 2; n2 ≥ 1 ⇒ n1 = 0; and n1 ≥ 1 ⇒ n2 = 0. Consequently either SL = 5[n5] · 4 · 2,
or SL = 5[n5] · 4 · 1[n1], or SL = 5[n5] · 2[n2], or SL = 5[n5] · 1[n1], where n2 ≤ 3 and n1 ≤ 2.
Thus,

|S| = σ(SL) ≤ 5n5 + 6 ≤ 5(t/5 − 1) + 6 < t + 8,

AVOIDING ZERO-SUM SUBSEQUENCES OF PRESCRIBED LENGTH OVER THE INTEGERS 11

which is a contradiction. Thus, |S| 6= t + 8.

Case 4: |S| 6= t + d for d ∈ [9, 11].

Assume that |S| = t + 9. If n3 ≥ 1, then 3 is a subsequence of SL which implies that
S contain a z.s.s T of length 3. Thus S′ = S · T −1 is a z.s.s of length |S| − 3 = t + 6
which does not contain a z.s.sb of length 6 and, equivalently, length t. This contradicts
Case 1, where we showed that no such z.s.s exists. Thus, n3 = 0. Similarly, n2 = 0 (by
Case 2) and n1 = 0 (by Case 3). Consequently, SL = 5[n5] · 4[n4] with n4 ≤ 2. Thus,

|S| = σ(SL) = 5n5 + 4n4 ≤ 5(t/5 − 1) + 4(2) < t + 9,

which is a contradiction. Thus, |S| 6= t + 9.

Since n5 ≥ 2, S contains a z.s.s of length σ(5[2]) = 10. Thus, |S| 6= t + 10.
Since n5 ≥ 1, S contains a z.s.s T of length 5. Thus S′ = S · T −1 is a z.s.s of length
|S| − 5 = t + 6 which does not contain a z.s.sb of length 6 and, equivalently, length t.
This contradicts Case 1. Thus, |S| 6= t + 11.

In conclusion, we have shown that if S is an arbitrary z.s.s over I3 = [−3, 3] which does
t(I3) = t + 6. (cid:3)

not contain a z.s.s of length t, then |S| = t + d for d ∈ [6, 11]. Thus, s′

In this section, we include Zhong’s proofs of Lemma 3 and Remark 4.

3. Appendix

Proof of Lemma 3.

(i) Since s(G) ≤ s′(G), it suﬃces to prove that s′(G) ≥ s(G). Let S = Qs(G)−1

gi be a
sequence in F (G) of length |S| = s(G) − 1 such that S has no zero-sum subsequence of
length exp(G). Assume that σ(S) = h ∈ G and let t ∈ N be such that (s(G) − 1)t ≡ 1
(mod exp(G)). Then (s(G) − 1)th = h in G. Deﬁne S′ = Qs(G)−1
(gi − th). Since
σ(S′) = σ(S) − (s(G) − 1)th = 0 and S′ does not contain a zero-sum subsequence of
length exp(G), it follows that s′(G) ≥ s(G).

(ii) Let S ∈ B(G) be such that |S| = s(G) − 1. We want to prove that S contains a
zero-sum subsequence of length n = exp(G). If we assume to the contrary that S does
not contain a zero-sum subsequence of length n, then Property D implies that there
exists T ∈ F (G) such that S = T [n−1]. Thus, |T | = c and σ(T ) = 0. Therefore T [n/c] is
a zero-sum sequence of length n, a contradiction.

n. Since s(G) = 4n − 3, then gcd(s(G) − 1, n) = 1. Thus,

Proof of Remark 4.
(i) Let n be odd and G ∼= Z2
s(G) = s′(G) by Lemma 3(i).
(ii) Let h ≥ 2 be an integer and G ∼= Z2
2h. Then exp(G) = 2h, s(G) = 4(2h − 1) + 1,
gcd(s(G) − 1, exp(G)) = 4, and G has Property D (by [12, Theorem 3.2]). Thus,
Lemma 3(ii) yields s′(G) < s(G). Since gcd(s(G) − 2, exp(G)) = 1, the proof of
Lemma 3(i) yields s′(G) > s(G) − 2. Thus, s′(G) = s(G) − 1.
