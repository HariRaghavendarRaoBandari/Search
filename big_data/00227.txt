On the vortex ﬁlament conjecture for Euler ﬂows

Robert L. Jerrard∗

Christian Seis†

March 2, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we study the evolution of a vortex ﬁlament in an incom-
pressible ideal ﬂuid. Under the assumption that the vorticity is concentrated
3, we prove that the curve evolves to leading order
along a smooth curve in R
by binormal curvature ﬂow. Our approach combines new estimates on the
distance of the corresponding Hamiltonian-Poisson structures with stability
estimates recently developed in [15].

Introduction

In this paper, we study the evolution of an incompressible ideal ﬂuid described by
the Euler equations. We are interested in data such that the initial vorticity is
3. One might
concentrated in a tube of radius ε ≪ 1 around a smooth curve in R
then ask,

• at later times, does the vorticity continue to concentrate around some curve,

and

• if so, how does the curve evolve?

The second question is not so hard if one already has a suﬃciently good answer
to the ﬁrst.
Indeed, the literature on this question, dating back to work of da
Rios in 1906 [4], shows that if one somehow knows that at some time the vorticity
concentrates smoothly and symmetrically in a small tube around a smooth curve,
then one can compute the instantaneous velocity of the curve to leading order.
These computations suggest that the curve should evolve, after a possible rescaling
in time, by an equation described in Section 2 below, known by various names,
including the binormal curvature ﬂow, the vortex ﬁlament equation, and the local
induction approximation.

Our results have the same character: they provide information about curve evo-
lution, conditional upon knowing that vorticity remains concentrated around some

curve. Their new feature is that we show that for these purposes, a quite weak de-
scription of the vorticity concentration suﬃces. Roughly speaking, we show that for
suitable initial data, as long as the vorticity remains concentrated on the same scale
ε ≪ 1 around some curve of the correct arclength, where concentration is measured
by a geometric variant of a particular negative Sobolev norm, then in fact the curve
evolves by the binormal curvature ﬂow. Our results also improve on earlier work
in that they require very little a priori smoothness of the curve around which the
vorticity concentrates, and they apply to very rough solutions of the Euler equations.
From another perspective, the relationship between the Euler equations and the
binormal curvature ﬂow can be formally understood by a correspondence between
Hamiltonian-Poisson structures giving rise to the two ﬂows. Our results may be seen
as giving quantitative estimates of a sort of distance between these Hamiltonian-
Poisson structures.

The belief that one can ﬁnd solutions of the Euler equations for which the vortic-
ity remains close for a signiﬁcant period of time to a ﬁlament evolving by binormal
curvature ﬂow may be called the “vortex ﬁlament conjecture” for the Euler equa-
tions. We believe that our results provide more credible evidence in favor of the
conjecture than any earlier arguments that we are aware of.

We conclude the introduction with a brief overview on preliminary and related

works.

• Formal asymptotics. As mentioned earlier, the ﬁrst derivation of the binormal
curvature ﬂow dates back to the work of da Rios in 1906 [4]. In his doctoral
thesis, the Italian mathematician formally computed the motion law of vortex
ﬁlaments with the help of potential theory. At this time, da Rios’ work was
mostly ignored, except by his supervisor Levi-Civita, who promoted the results
in a survey article [18, 19] many years later. In subsequent years, the local
induction approximation was rediscovered several times, see [23] and references
therein, and it is by now a classical topic in ﬂuid dynamics. Discussions that
include alternative models arising from more reﬁned formal asymptotics can
be found for example in the texts of Saﬀman [25, Chapter 11] or of Majda and
Bertozzi [20, chapter 7].

• Rigid motion. An explicit example for the motion of a vortex ﬁlament in an
Euler ﬂuid is the rigid motion of a perfect vortex ring, see e.g. [12, 1]. Here, the
evolution reduces to a translation with constant speed in direction normal to
the plane in which the ring is embedded. The possibility of non-trivial steady
vortex conﬁgurations featuring knots and links was conjectured by Kelvin [32].
Only very recently, such (inﬁnite energy) solutions were found by Enciso and
Peralta-Salas [8, 9]. Explicit knotted solutions to the binormal curvature ﬂow
were studied in [16].

• Dimension reduction. To the best of our knowledge, the only rigorous re-
sult in favor of the vortex ﬁlament conjecture for Euler ﬂows is restricted to
ﬂows with an axial symmetry. In [2], the authors manage to show that the
(axially symmetric) vorticity remains sharply concentrated in a small tube

2

which rigidly moves at a constant speed in the direction of the symmetry axis.
The analogous problem for two-dimensional ﬂuids is much easier and is by
now well-understood. In fact, if the vorticity is initially sharply concentrated
2 (or a subdomain), the 2D Euler dynamics
around a number of points in R
are well described by the so-called point vortex model. For details, we refer
the interested reader to Chapter 4 of the monograph [21] and the references
therein.

The binormal curvature ﬂow is also conjectured to arise as a description of dy-
namics of vortex ﬁlaments in certain quantum ﬂuids, as described by the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation. This problem too is very largely open, although some condi-
tional results, similar in spirit to the ones we prove here, are established in [13].

A higher-dimensional analog of the binormal curvature ﬂow has been shown
formally to describe the motion of codimension 2 vortex submanifolds in ideal ﬂuids
in dimensions n ≥ 4, ﬁrst in the context of quantum ﬂuids [13], and more recently
for the Euler equations [17, 27].

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the Euler equa-
tions, the binormal curvature ﬂow, and the notation that is used in this paper. We
subsequently present our rigorous results and discuss the method of this paper. In
Section 3, we present a heuristic derivation of the binormal curvature ﬂow from the
Euler equations by formally passing to the limit in the corresponding Hamiltonian-
Poisson structures. The remaining Section 4 contain the proofs.

2 Mathematical setting and results

2.1 Notation

For notational convenience, throughout the manuscript we use the same notation
for length, area, and volume. More precisely, | · | can stand for the one- or two-
dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure H1 or H2, respectively, or the Lebesgue measure L3
on R

3. It should be clear from the context, which measure is actually used.

We will always write Γ to denote a closed, oriented Lipschitz curve (normally
3 an arclength parametrization of

3 of length L, and γ : R/LZ → R

smoother) in R
Γ. Thus |γ′(s)| = 1 for all s ∈ R/LZ,

Γ = {γ(s) : s ∈ R/LZ}

and γ′(s) = τΓ := unit tangent to Γ at γ(s).

Depending on the context we may freely change between the notations ∂sγ and γ′
for the derivative of γ with respect to the arc-length parameter.

For s, t ∈ R/LZ, we always understand |s − t| to mean distance modulo LZ

between s and t; that is, |s − t| = mink∈Z |s − t − Lk|.

We remark that throughout most of the paper we will normalize by setting L = 1.
We will write

A . B

to mean that there exists some constant C, independent of ε (as long as 0 < ε < L
2 ),
such that A ≤ CB. Similarly, A = O(B) if |A| . B. Except where explicitly noted

3

otherwise, the implicit constants are absolute in the sense that they are independent
of all parameters. The implicit constants appearing in all such estimates may change
from line to line.

We will write µΓ to denote the vector-valued measure corresponding to integra-

tion over Γ, deﬁned by

Z φ · dµΓ =ZΓ

φ · τΓ dH1 =ZR/LZ

φ(γ(s)) · γ′(s) ds

for φ ∈ Cc(R

3; R

3).

If µ is an absolutely continuous measure with density ω, i.e., dµ = ωdx, we will
occasionally identify ω with µ.

Derivatives of measures are deﬁned in the sense of distributions.
Given γ and Γ as above, for s ∈ R/LZ, we deﬁne the security radius of Γ at γ(s)

by

rγ(s) = r(s) := sup

.



r > 0 :

|γ(s + h) − γ(s)| ≥ r
2

for all |h| ≥ r, and

|γ′(s + h) − γ′(s)| ≤ |h|
r

for all |h| ≤ r.

(1)
We set r(s) = 0 if γ is not diﬀerentiable at s. We will see in Lemma 3 below that
within the tube of variable radius rγ/4 around Γ, there is a well-deﬁned orthogonal
projection onto Γ.

We will also write (omitting subscripts when no confusion can result)

It is easy to check that

κ∗
γ(s) = κ∗(s) := 1/r(s).

κ∗(s) ≥ κ(s) = |γ′′(s)|

for all s,

(2)

(3)

provided that the letter is deﬁned. Note that all arclength parametrizations γ are
translates of one another, so that quantities such as norms of κ∗ depend only on the
geometry of Γ, not on the parametrization. In particular, we will be interested in
Lipschitz curves Γ for which

kκ∗

ΓkL1,∞ = kκ∗kL1,∞ := sup
σ>0

σ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)s ∈ R/LZ : |κ∗

γ(s)| ≥ σ(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ∞.

(4)

This is a weak regularity condition that allows corners (but not cusps) and a ﬁnite
number of self-intersections.

We will also need the following. Let ω be a vector-valued Radon measure on R

3.

We deﬁne the homogeneous ﬂat norm of ω as

kωkF := sup(cid:26)Z ξ · dω : ξ ∈ C 1

c (R

3; R

3) with k∇ × ξkL∞ ≤ 1(cid:27) .

(5)

3 → R

If ω : R
where L3 is the Lebesgue measure on R

3 is a locally integrable vector ﬁeld, then we write kωkF = kL3¬ωkF ,

3.

2.2 Euler equations

We consider the time-rescaled Euler equations

k−1
ε ∂tuε + uε · ∇uε + ∇pε = 0,
∇ · uε = 0,

(6)
(7)

where, as usual, uε : [0, ∞) × R

3 denotes the ﬂuid velocity and pε : [0, ∞) ×
3 → R is the pressure. Moreover, kε is a scaling factor that has to be speciﬁed

3 → R

R

later. The initial conﬁguration is a divergence-free vector ﬁeld uε

0 on R

3, that is

uε(0, · ) = uε
0.

To be more speciﬁc, we are interested in weak solutions of the Euler equation.

Deﬁnition 1. We call uε ∈ L∞(R; L2(R
0 in the sense of distributions, and

3; R

3)) a weak solution of (6), (7) if ∇·uε =

Z ∞
0 Z k−1

ε ∂tφ · uε + ∇φ : (uε ⊗ uε) dx dt +Z φ(0, · ) · uε

0 dx = 0

(8)

3; R

3) such that ∇ · φ = 0. A weak solution is

for every test function φ ∈ C ∞
said to be conservative if

c (R × R

t 7→Z |uε(t, x)|2dx

is constant.

Here and in the following, we understand undetermined integrals as integrals

over the whole space.

It is well-known that in (8) the pressure can be reintroduced as a Lagrange
multiplier for the divergence free condition on the test functions, and is then uniquely
determined up to a function that depends on time t only. The weak solutions uε,
however, are not unique, see for example [26, 28, 29, 6, 3]. In particular, it is shown
in [7] that energy conservation fails as criterion for uniqueness. On the positive side
existence of weak solutions for any initial datum in L2 was established in [33]. These
solutions are non-conservative (in fact, the energy is even discontinuous). In [31],
the authors construct a dense subset of L2 for which conservative solutions exist.

From the deﬁnition of weak solutions in (8), we immediately infer the following

identity.

Lemma 1. Let u ∈ L2
let ω = ∇ × u the vorticity (measure). Then for every φ ∈ C ∞

loc(R × R

2.3 Binormal curvature ﬂow

A family of smooth curves {Γ(t)}t∈[0,T ] ∈ R
ﬂow (BCF) if

3 is said to evolve by binormal curvature

∂tγ = γ′ × γ′′,

(10)
3 is an arc-length parametrization of
where for each t ∈ [0, T ], γ(t, · ) : R/LZ → R
Γ(t), i.e., Γ(t) = {γ(t, s) : s ∈ R/LZ} and |γ′(t, s)|2 = 1 for all s ∈ R/LZ. Here, L
is the length of the curve, and we assume the curve to be closed, so that R/LZ is
the interval of periodicity of γ(t, · ). In case where Γ(t) is a Frenet curve, then we
can equivalently write (10) as

∂tγ = κb,

where κ is the curvature and b is the binormal vector along the curve. That arc-
length parametrizations are indeed compatible with binormal curvature ﬂows can
be seen by computing

∂
∂t

|γ′|2 = 2γ′ · ∂tγ′ (10)

= 0.

Short-time existence of smooth solutions follows from classical arguments.

There is a striking similarity between Lemma 1 for Euler solutions and the fol-

lowing formula for binormal curvature ﬂows.

Lemma 2. Let {Γ(t)}t∈[0,T ] be a family of smooth curves evolving by binormal cur-
vature ﬂow. Then

for all φ ∈ C ∞

c (R

3). Here τ = τΓ denotes the tangent along Γ.

In Section 3 below, we will see that the identities (9) and (11) give rise to the
Hamiltonian-Poisson structures of the Euler equation and the binormal curvature
ﬂow, respectively. In a certain sense, in Theorems 1 and 2 below, we will estimate
the distance of these structures.

We brieﬂy recall the proof of Lemma 2 from [15]; see also [13] for a more general

result.

Proof. Let γ be an arc-length parametrization of Γ satisfying (10). We write φ and
γ in components and compute (summing implicitly)

d

dtZR/LZ

φi(γ) ∂sγi ds =ZR/LZ

∂jφi(γ)∂tγj∂sγi + φi(γ)∂s∂tγi ds.

Integrating by parts in the second term on the right-hand side and rearranging, one
ﬁnds that

d

dtZR/LZ

φi(γ) ∂sγi ds =ZR/LZ

(∇ × φ)(γ) · (∂tγ × ∂sγ) ds.

Since ∂sγ · ∂ssγ = 0, the equation (10) implies that ∂tγ × ∂sγ = −∂sγ × ∂tγ = ∂ssγ.
One arrives at (11) by substituting this into the right-hand side, integrating by parts
again, and using the fact that ∇(∇ × φ) is trace-free, so that ∇(∇ × φ) : I = 0.

6

In [15], Smets and the ﬁrst author develop a notion of weak solutions of the
binormal curvature ﬂow, in the spirit of geometric measure theory, based on the
identity (11), and allowing for phenomena, such as changes of topology, seen in
vortex ﬁlaments in real ﬂuids.
In the present work, (10) is a suitable notion as
we deal with smooth ﬂows only. Still, the results from [15] enter into our analysis
through stability estimates in the spirit of Theorem 3 in [15].

2.4 Main results

In this section we state our two main results. First, we give some conditions under
which it can be shown that Euler vortex ﬁlaments evolve to leading order by binormal
curvature ﬂow. The ﬁrst condition is that the vorticity concentrates on an ε-scale
around a smooth curve of ﬁxed length. Concentration is measured in terms of the
ﬂat norm, introduced in (5) above. More precisely, we will be interested in velocity
vector ﬁelds such that

k∇ × uε − µΛkF ≤ εL

(12)

for some curve Λ of length L, satisfying the weak regularity condition (4). We will
show that (12) implies a lower bound on the kinetic energy:

Z 1

2

|uε|2 ≥

L log(L/ε)

4π

− O(1).

(13)

This is contained in Theorem 1 below, though with a very indirect proof. We next
ﬁx the time rescaling factor in the Euler equations as

kε =

4π

| log(ε/L)|

.

It is a classical fact that this is the “right” scaling to obtain binormal curvature ﬂow
in the limit ε → 0. As we discuss in Section 3 below, this fact follows formally from
the energy scaling (13), and it is conﬁrmed by our main results.

We also introduce the excess of the kinetic energy relative to the curve Λ:

kε

LZ 1

2

Excε(uε, Λ) :=

|uε|2 dx − 1,

L = |Λ|.

(14)

The excess is a dimensionless quantity and is preserved by the evolution if uε is a
conservative solution and Λ has constant length (e.g., as a solution to the binormal
curvature ﬂow). It measures the extent to which the lower bound in (13) is saturated.
We will be interested in velocity ﬁelds for which

Excε(uε, Λ) ≤ Ckε.

(15)

Together, conditions (12), (15) imply that the kinetic energy is essentially induced
by vorticity.

Our ﬁrst main result estimates the diﬀerence between the right-hand sides of
identities (9) and (11) for Euler and the binormal curvature ﬂow. This can be
understood as an estimate of the extent to which the (distributional) instantaneous
velocity of a vortex ﬁlament in a solution of the Euler equations deviates from the
binormal curvature.

In view of Lemmas 1 and 2, the conclusion (16) implies that if uε(x, t) is a
solution of the Euler equation, {Γ(t)} is a binormal curvature ﬂow of length L, and
if k∇ × uε(·, t0) − µΓ(t0)k ≤ εL at some time t0, then

at time t0. This shows that (at time t0) the vorticity in uε is close in a distributional
sense to a binormal curvature ﬂow if the excess is small.

The same estimate (16) may also be understood as describing the distance of the
Hamiltonian-Poisson structures associated with the Euler equation, cf. (9), and the
binormal curvature ﬂow, cf. (11). We discuss this in more detail in Section 3, where
we also review the Hamiltonian-Poisson structures of both evolutions.

Like all prior work1 on this subject, Theorem 1 addresses only the question of
estimating the instantaneous velocity of a vortex ﬁlament known to concentrate
at a ﬁxed time t0 around a curve – it does not say anything about when such a
concentration condition is preserved by the dynamics. But in a number of other
ways, it improves on known results:

• As far as we know, all previous studies of the dynamics of vortex ﬁlaments con-
sist of asymptotic computations that describe only highly idealized vortex ﬁla-
ments, such as the “prototype velocity ﬁeld” associated to an ε-regularization
of a C 2 ﬁlament, introduced in Section 2.5 below.

By contrast, Theorem 1 applies to a much larger and more physically reason-
able class of velocity ﬁelds — those with vorticity concentrated in the weak
sense (12) about some curve Γ, and with small excess.

1Here and in what follows, we are omitting papers [12, 1, 2] that assume rotational and often

additional symmetries.

8

• Earlier results that we are aware of do not obtain any very useful control over
error terms, whereas Theorem 1 quantiﬁes errors well enough to conclude in
Theorem 2 below that, as long as the vorticity remains concentrated around
some curve, one can control the closeness of the vorticity to a binormal cur-
vature ﬂow over a macroscopic time interval.

One reason this is possible is that the distributional estimates that we obtain,
relating vortex ﬁlament velocity and the binormal curvature ﬂow, seem to be
more useful than the pointwise estimates found in earlier work.

• Theorem 1 shows that, at least at a ﬁxed time, the binormal curvature ﬂow
approximates the velocity of vortex ﬁlaments (in a distributional sense), even
when the vorticity is concentrated around a curve of low regularity, measured
by the geometric quantity kκ∗kL1,∞.
For example, a recent paper [5] of de la Hoz and Vega studies the binormal
curvature ﬂow for initial data given by a regular planar polygon. Owing to
the weak regularity conditions imposed on the curve Γ, Theorem 1 implies
that if one considers the Euler equation for initial data whose vorticity is
concentrated in the sense of (12) around a polygon, and with small excess, then
the distributional initial velocity of the vorticity is close to the distributional
binormal curvature of the polygon – a sum of delta functions at its vertices.

In short, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dynamics of

vortex ﬁlaments in Euler ﬂows have been approached in a quantitative way.

Our second main result shows, as discussed above, that a distributional estimate
such as (16) is suﬃcient to ensure that a vortex ﬁlament remains close to a binormal
curvature ﬂow over a macroscopic time interval (i.e. bounded below, independent
of ε, as ε → 0).

Theorem 2. Let {Γ(t)}t∈[0,T ] be a family of smooth curves evolving by binormal
curvature ﬂow (10) with |Γ(t)| = L and with arc-length parametrizations γ : [0, T ] ×

For ε ∈ (0, L
for initial data satisfying

2 ), let uε be a conservative weak solution to the Euler equation (6), (7),

k∇ × uε(0) − µΓ(0)kF ≤ εL,

Excε(uε(0), Γ(0)) ≤ Ckε.

(18)

If, for every t ∈ [0, T ], there is a Lipschitz curve Λ(t) with arc-length parametriza-
3 and such that uε(t) and Λ(t) satisfy (12), and if in

then there exists a function ¯σ : [0, T ] → R/LZ and a constant C ′ < ∞, depending
only the bounds in (17), (18), (19), and in particular independent of ε and L, such
that for any t ∈ [0, T ],

(20)

(21)

Our statement contains two estimates. First, (20) shows that in the regime of
small ε, the curves Λ and Γ are close one to the other uniformly in t and s. The
distance of both curves is of order | log ε|−1/2 and thus controlled by the initial datum
via (18). The somewhat weaker L2 bound on the diﬀerence of the tangents at Λ
and Γ is displayed in (21). The latter ensures the closeness of both curves in a very
geometric sense: The curves are locally very nearly parallel. Because no assumptions
are imposed on the arc-length parametrizations λ, the spatial translations ¯σ(t) are
necessary in both (20) and (21).

As remarked above, the existence of smooth solutions of the binormal curvature
ﬂow (10) is standard, so hypotheses (17), (18) are assumptions about the initial data.
The content of the theorem is that to prove the vortex ﬁlament conjecture for such
initial data, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a solution uε for which vorticity remains concentrated
around some curve, in the sense of (12), (19). As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst
result to describe any conditions under which vortex ﬁlaments can be related to the
binormal curvature ﬂow for a macroscopic length of time. In addition, Theorem 2,
like Theorem 1 above, is quantitative in a way that one does not ﬁnd in the previous
literature.

The task of constructing solutions as considered in Theorem 2, should one hope
to do so, is in principle made easier by the the facts that uε need only belong to
L2, that vorticity concentration is required only in the weak sense (12), and that
only the weak regularity condition (19) is a priori required for the curves Λ(t). For
example, it is conceivable that one could construct weak solutions satisfying (12),
(19) using techniques inspired by convex integration, as developed in references such
as [6, 7, 3, 33, 31]. On the other hand, the theorem shows that the regime described
by (12), (19) is quite “rigid”, and so may well be inaccessible to these techniques,
which exploit “ﬂexible” aspects of the Euler equations.

Remark 1. For α > 0, the statements of the theorems are invariant with respect to
the rescaling

Γ 7→ ˜Γ = αΓ,

ε 7→ ˜α = αε,

u(·) 7→ ˜u(·) =

1
α

α(cid:1).
u(cid:0) ·

Due to this scaling invariance, it suﬃces to prove the Theorems 2 and 1 for |Γ| = 1.
In particular, we remark that if we write κ∗ and ˜κ∗ for the functions deﬁned in
(2), associated to parametrizations of Γ and ˜Γ respectively, then it is straightforward
to check that kκ∗kL1,∞ = k˜κ∗kL1,∞. We believe that this invariance makes kκ∗kL1,∞
a natural quantity to consider.

2.5 Method of this paper

In this subsection, we explain the ideas of the proofs of our main results, Theorems
2 and 1 above. In view of Remark 1, it is enough to consider the case L = 1 in the
following.

The main estimate (16) of Theorem 1 is derived by estimating the (Euler) velocity
uε against a prototype velocity ﬁeld vε, which itself satisﬁes the assertions of the
theorem. To be more speciﬁc, given the curve Γ from the hypothesis, we construct
vε by

vε = ∇ × (−∆)−1(ρε ∗ µΓ).

Here, {ρε}ε↓0 denotes a sequence of radially symmetric standard molliﬁers in R
3,
supported in a ball of radius ε and such that ρε(x) = ε−3ρ1(ε−1x). The convolution
of ρε with a measure µ is deﬁned as

ρε ∗ µ(x) =ZR

3

ρε(x − y) dµ(y).

Moreover, the nonlocal diﬀerential operator ∇ × (−∆)−1 associates to a vorticity
ﬁeld ω a vector potential v via the Biot–Savart law

v(x) = ∇ × (−∆)−1ω(x) =

1

4πZ

x − y
|x − y|3 × ω(y) dy.

(22)

That is, v is the unique divergence free vector ﬁeld satisfying ∇×v = ω. Notice that
the Biot–Savart kernel is obtained as the curl of the Newtonian potential. We will
sometimes write (∇×)−1 = ∇ × (−∆)−1. The vector ﬁeld vε can thus be written as

vε(x) =

where, as above, γ : R/Z → R

The main properties of vε that we will use later on are summarized in the fol-

lowing proposition.

Hence, in view of (23), (25) and (26), the prototype velocity ﬁeld vε satisﬁes,
among others, the concentration condition (12) and the two statements of Theorem
1. Estimates (24)–(25) will be used to bound error terms. In order to verify Theorem
1, we thus need to control how much uε deviates from vε. This is the content of
Section 4.3 below. The concentration condition (23) will be established in Section
4.2 below. The remaining statements of Proposition 1 are proved in Section 4.5.

Let us now discuss our approach to Theorem 2. The hypothesis and the Hamil-
tonian structure of the Euler equations guarantee that the excess Excε(uε, Λ) is of
the order of the error term, that is O(| log ε|−1). In view of the main estimate (16) of
Theorem 1 and the weak formulation of Lemma 2 for the binormal curvature ﬂow,
the question of how close {Λ(t)}t∈[0,T ] is to the binormal curvature ﬂow {Γ(t)}t∈[0,T ]
amounts thus to the study of stability of the latter. Stability properties of binormal
curvature ﬂows have been recently investigated by Smets and the ﬁrst author. In
[15], it is shown that for a certain decaying C 2 continuation X of τΓ it holds that

|∂tX · ξ − ∇(∇ × X) : ξ ⊗ ξ| ≤ K(1 − X · ξ),

(27)

for some K = K(Γ) and all unit vector ﬁelds ξ. This remarkable property is remi-
niscent of (11). The binormal curvature ﬂow defect of the ﬂow {Λ(t)}t∈[0,T ] is thus
controlled by the distance of the tangent ﬁelds τΛ and τΓ. We use this stability
estimate to deduce Theorem 2 from Theorem 1.

3 The Hamiltonian–Poisson structure: Heuristics

for the vortex ﬁlament conjecture

In this section, we review Marsden and Weinstein’s interpretation of the Euler equa-
tions and the binormal curvature ﬂow as Hamiltonian systems on Poisson manifolds
[22], see also [27, 17] for more recent and more general discussions. As opposed to
the original paper, where this interpretation is worked out in the language of Lie
algebras, our approach is based on vector calculus which allows us to identify the
involved ingredients directly with various quantities that appear in the statements
of our theorems. The parallels between the Hamiltonian-Poisson structures can be
used to pass to the limit in a formal way. We perform this limit at the end of this
section.

We recall that we need three ingredients to constitute a Hamiltonian-Poisson

system:

• a diﬀerentiable manifold M;

• a Poisson bracket on M, that is, a bilinear map that takes functions on M
to functions on M, is skew-symmetric, i.e., {F, G} + {G, F } = 0, satisﬁes the
Jacobi identity, i.e., {E, {F, G}} + {F, {G, E}} + {G, {E, F }} = 0, and obeys
the Leibniz rule, i.e., {EF, G} = {E, G}F + {F, G}E;

• and a function H : M → R.

12

We call a dynamical system p(t) in M that is given by the diﬀerential equation

d
dt

F (p) = {F, H}(p)

(28)

for all F : M → R a Hamiltonian-Poisson system on M. The function H is
referred to as the Hamiltonian. Observe that the Hamiltonian is preserved during
the evolution, because

H(p)

(28)
= {H, H}(p) = 0

d
dt

by the skew-symmetry of the Poisson bracket.

In some situations, the Poisson bracket is induced by a skew-symmetric bilinear

form on a Riemannian manifold sp : TpM × TpM → R via

{F, G}(p) = sp(grad F, grad G).

We also recall that the relation between gradients and diﬀerentials on Riemannian
manifolds is established by the duality

gp(grad H(p), δp) = d H(p)(δp)

for all δp ∈ TpM. If sp is non-degenerate, (M, s) is called a symplectic manifold.

We ﬁrst explain the formal Hamiltonian-Poisson structure of the Euler equations.
As we are interested in the situation where the vorticity is concentrated along curves,
it is convenient to consider vorticity ﬁelds as main objects. We accordingly take the
manifold to be the phase space of vorticity ﬁelds

M = {ω : ∃u s.t. ∇ · u = 0 and ω = ∇ × u} .

For ω ∈ M we will sometimes use the notation (∇×)−1ω = ∇ × (−∆)−1ω (= u),
as motivated by the Biot–Savart law (22). Recall that this deﬁnes a canonical
isomorphism between M and the space of divergence-free velocity ﬁelds. Since M
is a linear space, we can identify the tangent space TωM with M itself. It turns
out to be more convenient, however, to use the above-mentioned isomorphism to
represent the tangent space as the space of velocity ﬁelds

TωM ∼= {v : ∇ · v = 0 } .

This point of view is quite natural since vortex ﬁlaments are convected by the ﬂow.
Thus, the tangent vector at t = 0 to a smooth path ω(t) in M (with ω(0) = ω) will
be represented as v = (∇×)−1 ˙ω(0). The Poisson bracket for the Euler equation is
induced by a skew-symmetric bilinear (symplectic) form on a Riemannian metric.
The metric tensor is then chosen to be

and the skew-symmetric bilinear form is

gω(v, w) =Z v · w dx,
sω(v, w) =Z (v × w) · ω dx.

13

Finally, the Hamiltonian is the kinetic energy, which, when expressed in terms of the
vorticity ﬁeld is H(ω) = 1

2R |(∇×)−1ω|2 dx, which is just the H −1 norm squared.

A short computation shows that the Hamiltonian–Poisson system associated with
these ingredients constitutes the Euler equations. Indeed, the deﬁnitions imply that
grad H(ω) = (∇×)−1ω =: u, so

{F, H}(ω) =Z (grad F × u) · ω dx,

and thus the elementary identity A · (B × C) = −B · (A × C) and the fact that
grad F is divergence-free imply that

{F, H}(ω) = −Z grad F · (ω × u) dx = −Z grad F · (ω × u + ∇q) dx

for a scalar q. In particular, since

we can write

ω × u = u · ∇u − ∇(

1
2

|u|2)

ω × u + ∇q = u · ∇u + ∇p

for ∇p chosen so that this whole expression is divergence-free and belongs to TωM.
Then we can rewrite the above as

{F, H}(ω) = − d F (ω)(u · ∇u + ∇p).

On the other hand, since we have identiﬁed TωM with (∇×)−1M,

d
dt

F (ω) = d F (ω)(cid:0)(∇×)−1∂tω(cid:1) = d F (ω) (∂tu) .

It follows that the evolution (28) takes the form

d F (ω) (∂tu + u · ∇u + ∇p) = 0.

Since F was arbitrary, and because our choice of spaces enforces the incompressibility
constraint, this yields the equations (6), (7) modulo the scaling factor which we will
see later arises from a natural rescaling of the Hamiltonian.

In the following, we try to convince the reader that binormal curvature ﬂow
naturally arises as the motion of vortex ﬁlaments if the vorticity concentrates along
a curve. In this case, the vorticity ﬁeld is tangential to such a curve and the manifold
of vorticity ﬁelds degenerates to

M =(cid:8) oriented, closed curves Γ in R
3(cid:9) .

Inﬁnitesimal variations can be represented by vector ﬁelds on these curves, and thus,
we identify

TΓM = {vector ﬁelds ϕ on Γ} .

14

These vector ﬁelds are the velocity ﬁelds which transport the curve, and thus, the
L2 metric tensor becomes

Likewise, the limiting skew-symmetric bilinear form reads

gΓ(ϕ, ψ) =ZΓ
sΓ(ϕ, ψ) =ZΓ

ϕ · ψ dH1.

ϕ × ψ · τΓ dH1,

where τΓ denotes the positively oriented unit tangent on Γ. Finally, if the vorticity
sharply concentrates around Γ and vorticity is the only source for the kinetic energy,
the Hamiltonian becomes the length of the curve, H(Γ) = |Γ|.

We now compute the Hamiltonian-Poisson system generated by these ingredi-
3 is an arc-length parametrization of Γ, then d H(Γ)(ϕ) =

ents. If γ : [0, L) → R

−R L

0 γ′′(s) · ϕ(s) ds, and thus grad H(Γ) = −γ′′. It thus follows that

{F, H}(Γ) = −Z L

0

(grad F × γ′′) · γ′ ds =Z L

0

(γ′ × γ′′) · grad F ds.

Hence, using similar arguments as above, the Hamilton-Poisson system (28) becomes

d F (Γ) (∂tγ − γ′ × γ′′) = 0.

Since F was arbitrary, this shows that the curve evolves by binormal curvature ﬂow.
We summarize the above discussion in the following table, where we introduce
subscripts E and B to distinguish between (some) objects that relate to the Euler
equation and the binormal curvature ﬂow, respectively.

We wish to make the above heuristic argument a little more convincing by com-
paring the above Hamiltonian-Poisson structures, including the Poisson brackets,
at some ω ∈ ME and Γ ∈ MB such that ω is ε-concentrated around Γ. In this

15

situation, it turns out to that HE(ω) ≥ | log ε|
of Theorem 1 above.
introducing

4π HB(Γ) − O(1); this is a consequence
It is therefore natural to rescale the Euler Hamiltonian by

H ε

E(ω) =

4π

| log ε|

HE(ω).

(Note that the rescaling is exactly the one we obtain by time rescaling.) To compare
the Poisson brackets, we need to be able to (approximately) identify functions F, G
on ME with functions on MB. It is not clear how to do this in general, but for
certain functions there are natural choices. In particular:

• We would like the rescaled Euler Hamiltonian H ε

E to correspond to the BCF

Hamiltonian HB.

• Given φ ∈ C 2

c (R

3), we can deﬁne linear maps ℓφ on the two manifolds

which are natural counterparts of each other:

ℓE,φ(ω) :=Z φ · ω dx ,

ℓB,φ(Γ) :=ZΓ

φ · τ dH1 .

We can then supplement the above table with a couple of new entries. It is straight-
forward to check the following, and the proofs are essentially contained in (9) and
(11) above.

In this context, our second main result, Theorem 1, strengthens and reﬁnes the
heuristic arguments described above by providing a precise, quantitative version of
the statement that if ω ∈ ME is concentrated in an ε neighborhood of a curve
Γ ∈ MB and if H ε
E, ℓφ}(ω) is close to {HB, ℓφ}(Γ).

E(ω) is close to HB(Γ), then {H ε

4 Proofs

The remainder of the paper is devoted to the rigorous justiﬁcation of Theorems 2 and
1. We start with some preliminaries on geometric properties of non-self-intersecting
C 2 curves and derive some properties of the ﬂat norm.

4.1 Curves for which kκ∗kL1

,∞ < ∞.

Assume that Γ is a closed Lipschitz curve such that

|Γ| = 1,

and

kκ∗

ΓkL1,∞ < ∞.

(29)

In particular, this implies that rγ(s) > 0 a.e. for any arclength parametrization γ.
We will use the notation

T := {γ(s) + v : s ∈ R/Z, v ∈ R

3, v · γ′(s) = 0, |v| <

r(s)}.

Thus T is a tube of varying thickness around Γ. In general, T need not be open, but
it is straightforward to check that it is measurable. We record some of its properties:

Lemma 3. For every x ∈ T , there exists a unique closest point P (x) in Γ, char-
acterized by dist(x, Γ) = |x − P (x)|, and we may deﬁne ζ : T → R/Z by requiring
that

P (x) = γ(ζ(x))

for all x ∈ T ,

If γ is C 2 then ζ is C 1 in T , with

∇ζ(x) =

γ′(ζ(x))

1 − (x − γ(ζ(x))) · γ′′(ζ(x))

.

(30)

More generally, if we only assume (29), then ζ is locally Lipschitz in T , and

A similar function ζ, but for smoother Γ and deﬁned on a tube of uniform

diameter, can be found in [15, Prop. 4].

Proof. Fix x ∈ T ; then there exist s ∈ R/Z and v ∈ R

3 such that

x = γ(s) + v,

v · γ′(s) = 0,

|v| <

4

r(s).

(32)

We may assume, by changing variables and reparametrizing γ, that s = 0, γ(0) =
0 ∈ R

3 and γ′(0) = (0, 0, 1), and we will write

γ = (γ⊥, γk) ∈ R

2 × R,

x = v = (v⊥, 0),

r0 = r(0).

We will show that P (x) is well-deﬁned by proving that γ(0) is the unique closest
point in Γ to x, or in other words that

if 0 < |h| ≤ 1/2,

then |x − γ(h)| > |v| = |v⊥|.

(33)

If |h| ≥ r0, then the deﬁnition of r(0) implies that |γ(h)| = |γ(h) − γ(0)| ≥ 1
by (32),

2 r0, so

|γ(h) − x| ≥ |γ(h)| − |v| ≥

r0 > |v|.

(34)

We thus assume |h| < r0. By the deﬁnition of r(·),

|γ′(h) − γ′(0)|2 ≥ 1 −

for a.e. |h| ≤ r0. It follows that

|γ′

For 0 < h < r0, we integrate these inequalities to obtain

h ≥ γk(h) ≥ h(1 −

|γ⊥(h)| ≤

Thus

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

It follows from this by elementary calculations, using the fact that |v⊥| < 1
4 r0, that
|γ(h) − x|2 > |v⊥|2. The same estimate holds for −r0 < h < 0, by essentially the
same argument, completing the proof of (33).

The uniqueness of the closest point implies that P (·) and ζ(·) are continuous in
T . Indeed, if xk → x in T and P (xk) → y, then it is clear that y ∈ Γ and that
dist(x, y) = limk dist(xk, Γ) = dist(x, Γ), and hence that y = P (x).

To verify that ζ is Lipschitz, consider y ∈ T near x, and let h := ζ(y). If y is

suﬃciently close to x, then h satisﬁes

|h| < r0,

y = γ(h) + w,

w · γ′(h) = 0.

We would like to estimate |h| = |ζ(x) − ζ(y)| in terms of |x − y|. To do this, note
that |y − x| ≥ |γ′(h) · (y − x)| = |γ′(h) · (γ(h) − x)|. By writing

γ′ · (γ − x) = (γ′

⊥, γ′

k) · (γ⊥ − v⊥, γk)

and using the estimates for various components of γ and γ′ in (35), (36), (37), we
ﬁnd that

|v⊥|
r0
as long as |h| < r0. Since |v⊥| < 1
4r0, it follows that |x − y| ≥ 1
|h| < 1

4 r0. Because x was arbitrary, this shows that for x, y ∈ T ,

r(ζ(x)).

It follows that ζ is locally Lipschitz in T and hence a.e. diﬀerentiable in T .

Next, at every point of diﬀerentiability, it follows from (39) that

18

On the other hand, if ζ is diﬀerentiable at x and T has density 1 at x in the sense
|Br(x)∩T |
that limrց0
|Br(x)| = 1, then there exists a sequence yk → x such that, writing
hk := ζ(yk) and still assuming ζ(x) = 0,

Thus, again decomposing γ and γ′ and using (35), (36), (37), we check that

which implies that |∇ζ(x)|−1 ≤ 1 + |v⊥|

Finally, if γ is C 2, then it follows from what we have said above (which shows

= 1 + dist(x,Γ)

that ζ(x) = s when (32) holds) that

ϕ(x, ζ(x)) = 0

for ϕ(x, t) = (x − γ(t)) · γ′(t).

Because |γ′′(s)| ≤ 1
in T . Thus the implicit function theorem implies that ζ is C 1 and that

r(s) , the deﬁnition of T implies that ∂tϕ(x, t) ≤ −3/4 everywhere

i(ζ(x)) − [1 − (x − γ(ζ(x))) · γ′′(ζ(x))] ∂iζ(x) = 0.

We obtain (30) by rearranging.

The following Lemma is an important reason for the relevance of the weak L1

norm of κ∗.

Lemma 4. There exists an absolute constant C such that for every x ∈ R
every r > 0,

|{s ∈ R/Z : |γ(s) − x| < r}| ≤ Crkκ∗kL1,∞.

3 and

(40)

In fact the proof will show that we may take C = 8.

Proof. Fix x ∈ R
2 cases.

3 and r > 0, and let A := {s ∈ R/Z : |γ(s) − x| < r}. We consider

Case 1: |A| ≤ 8r.
It is clear from the deﬁnition of r(·) that

1

κ∗(s) = r(s) ≤ 1 for every s, and hence
that |{s ∈ R/Z : κ∗(s) ≥ 1}| ≥ 1, which implies that kκ∗kL1,∞ ≥ 1. Thus (40)
holds.

Case 2: |A| > 8r.

19

For any s ∈ A, there must then exist t ∈ A such that 4r < |s − t| < 1/2. The

deﬁnition of A and the triangle inequality imply that |γ(s) − γ(t)| < 2r. Then

2r > |γ′(s) · (γ(t) − γ(s))| = |γ′(s) · γ′(τ )| |t − s|

for some τ between s and t.
|γ′(s) − γ′(τ )|2 = 2 − 2γ′(s) · γ′(τ ) > 1.

It follows that γ′(s) · γ′(τ ) < 1

2, and hence that

These facts imply that r(s) ≤ 4r. To check this, we must show that for every
ρ > 4r, one of two inequalities appearing in the deﬁnition (1) of r(·) is violated.
The ﬁrst of these inequalities is

|γ(s + h) − γ(s)| ≥

ρ
2

for all |h| ≥ ρ,

which is violated by s + h = t, if 4r < ρ < |t − s|. The other inequality is

|γ′(s + h) − γ′(s)| ≤

|h|
ρ

for all |h| ≤ ρ,

and is violated by s + h = τ , if |τ − s| < ρ. Thus at least one of these must fail
when ρ > 4r, so r(s) ≤ 4r as claimed.

Since s was arbitrary, we conclude A ⊂ {s : κ∗(s) ≥ 1

4r }, and hence that

This proves Lemma 4.

|A| ≤ 4rkκ∗kL1,∞.

4.2 Some properties of the ﬂat norm

Lemma 5. Let ω be a divergence-free vector-valued measure on R
∞. Then

kωkF = inf{|ϕ|(R

3) : ϕ ∈ M(R

3; R

3), ∇ × ϕ = ω}

(41)

and the inﬁmum is attained.

In the statement of the lemma, M(R

3; R

3) denotes the space of vector-valued

measures on R

3, and |ϕ| denotes the total variation of the measure ϕ, deﬁned by

|ϕ|(R

3) = sup(cid:26)Z f · dϕ : f ∈ Cc(R

3; R

3), kf kL∞ ≤ 1(cid:27) .

Clearly, if ϕ is absolutely continuous and integrable, then |ϕ|(R

3) = kϕkL1.

The lemma is a special case of variant of [11, 4.1.12], rewritten in the language

of vector calculus. We provide a proof for the reader’s convenience.

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that for any ξ ∈ C ∞
vector-valued Radon measure ϕ such that ∇ × ϕ = ω,

c (R

3; R

3) with k∇ × ξkC 0 ≤ 1 and any

Z ξ · dω =Z ∇ × ξ · dϕ ≤ |ϕ|(R

3).

20

It follows that

kωkF ≤ inf{|ϕ|(R

3) : ϕ ∈ M(R

3; R

3), ∇ × ϕ = ω}.

The other inequality is a nice application of the Hahn–Banach theorem. We denote
3) equipped with the maximum norm, and deﬁne
by X the vector space Cc(R
the linear subspace

3; R

Y :=(cid:8)f ∈ X : ∃ξ ∈ C 1

c (R

3; R

3) with f = ∇ × ξ(cid:9) ,

also equipped with the maximum norm. We furthermore deﬁne implicitly

L(∇ × ξ) :=Z ξ · d ω

for vector ﬁelds ∇ × ξ ∈ Y . This linear operator is well-deﬁned thanks to the
divergence-free condition for ω. Indeed, if ξ1 and ξ2 are such that ∇ × ξ1 = ∇ × ξ2,
then ξ1 − ξ2 = ∇ρ for some C 2

c function ρ, and thus

Z ξ1 · dω −Z ξ2 · dω =Z ∇ρ · dω = 0,

because ∇ · ω = 0. Moreover, L : Y → R is bounded with operator-norm

kLkY →R = sup {L(f ) : f ∈ Y with kf kL∞ ≤ 1} = kωkF .

By the Hahn–Banach theorem (see, e.g., [24, Theorem 3.3]), there exists a linear
function ¯L : X → R such that ¯L agrees with L on Y , and whose norm is not larger
than that of L:

k ¯LkX→R = kLkY →R = kωkF .

By duality (see, e.g., [10, Chapter 1.8]), there exists a vector-valued Radon measure

¯L(f ) =Z f · dϕ for all f ∈ Cc(R

3).

To prove (44) and (45), we need some preparation. First, note from assumption

(12) and estimate (23) in Proposition 1 that

k∇ × uε − ∇ × vεkF ≤ 2ε.

(46)

Next, we write vε in the form vε = ∇ × Φε, for Φε = G ∗ ρε ∗ µΓ, where G denotes
the Newtonian potential G(z) = 1
4π|z|. We recall that Φε(x) = (G ∗ µΓ)(x) for all x
such that dist(x, Γ) ≥ ε by the mean value property of harmonic functions. Notice

also thatR dµΓ = 0, because Γ is a closed curve. As a consequence,

whenever |x| is suﬃciently large. Now let χ ∈ C ∞
c (B2(0)) be a function such that
χ = 1 in B1(0), and let χλ(x) = χ(x/λ). Then using the above decay of Φε, one
easily checks that

|Φε(x)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Z (G(x − z) − G(x)) dµΓ(z)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .Z |z|

Also, after again using the above decay of Φε, we ﬁnd

λ→∞

Thanks to (24) (with q = ∞) in Proposition 1 and (46) we conclude that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Z vε · (vε − uε) dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) . kκ∗kL1,∞.

It thus follows by (25) in Proposition 1 and the deﬁnition (14) of Excε that

(Recall that κ∗ ≥ 1.) From this estimate, we readily deduce (44).

We turn to the proof of (45). We let 1 < p < 2 < q < ∞ be arbitrarily ﬁxed

such that 1 = 1

Now we choose p = 4/3 and apply Young’s inequality ab ≤ a2/2 + b2/2 together
with (46) and (47) to deduce (45). This proves Theorem 1.

4.4 Proof of Theorem 2

Proof of Theorem 2. Throughout this proof, implicit constants hidden in symbols
such as . or O(· · · ) may depend on quantities appearing in assumptions (17), (18),
and (19), but are independent of ε and of properties of Λ, Γ and uε not appearing
in the assumptions.

Let us deﬁne

Rγ :=

1
4

inf(cid:8)rγ(t,·)(s) : 0 ≤ t ≤ T, s ∈ R/Z(cid:9) ,
3 : dist(x, Γ(t)) < Rγ(cid:9) .

N(Γ, t) :=(cid:8)x ∈ R

We have assumed that Rγ > 0, see (17). For every t ∈ [0, T ], according Lemma 3,
there is a (well-deﬁned) map ζt : N(Γ, t) → R/Z characterized by

|x − γ(t, ζt(x))| = dist(x, Γ(t)).

Recall from (2), (3) that rγ(t)(s) ≤ |∂ssγ(t, s)|−1 for all t, s. Thus the deﬁnitions
entail that

|x − γ(t, ζt(x))||∂ssγ(t, ζt(x))| ≤ 1/4

in N(Γ, t)

so that k∇ζtkW 2,∞ . 1 thanks to assumption (17) and (30) in Lemma 3. Similar
estimates hold for the temporal derivatives of ζt and ∇ζt. Indeed, diﬀerentiating the
deﬁning condition (x − γ(t, ζt(x)) · ∂sγ(t, ζt(x)) = 0 with respect to t and recalling
that γ is a solution to the binormal curvature ﬂow, we compute the identity

∂tζt(x) =

(x − γ(t, ζt(x)) · (∂sγ(t, ζt(x)) × ∂3

s γ(t, ζt(x)))

1 − (x − γ(t, ζt(x)) · ∂2

s γ(t, ζt(x))

.

In view of (17), it is thus not diﬃcult to infer k∂tζtkW 1,∞ . 1.

Following [15], we now deﬁne

In addition, the fact that γ is a binormal curvature ﬂow endows Xγ with certain
remarkable properties (see (27) above), established in [15], which will be recalled
below.

Then for every t, by assumption (12) and (48),

Also, it follows from assumptions (12) and (18) that kµΓ(0) − µΛ(0)kF ≤ 2ε, so

Moreover, (suppressing for readability the dependence on t of various quantities) it
follows from (9) that

From hypothesis (12) and (48),

Z ∂tXγ · dµε =Z ∂tXγ · dµΛ + O(ε),

and Theorem 1 and assumption (19) imply that

| log ε|Z ∇(∇×Xγ) : uε ⊗uε dx =ZΛ

Note also that for every vector ﬁeld φ,

Thus

However, it is proved in [15, Prop. 4] that for any unit vector ξ,

where K depends only on Rγ and sup0≤t≤T k∂3
s γ(t, ·)kL∞. This is the remarkable
property mentioned above, reﬂecting the fact that γ is a binormal curvature ﬂow.
As a result,

Combining this with (49), (50) and (51), we conclude that

We will suppress the variable t, as it is not relevant here. Let λ : [0, T ] × R/Z → R
be an arc-length parametrization of Λ having the same orientation as γ. For s ∈
R/Z, let δΓ(s) := dist(λ(s), Γ). We will show that for all small enough ε and for
every t ∈ [0, T ],

4-5], but we recall the argument for the convenience of the reader.

First, it follows from the deﬁnition of f that if x = λ(s) for any s ∈ R/Z, then

1 − XΓ(x) · τΛ(x) ≥ 1 − |Xγ(x)| = 1 − f (δ2

We now consider s ∈ R/Z such that δΓ(s) < Rγ, and hence ζ is well-deﬁned near
x = γ(s). For such s, we will write σ(s) = ζ(λ(s)), so that γ(σ(s)) = P (λ(s)). Note
that if γ′(σ(s)) · λ′(s) ≤ 0, then 1 − f (δ2

Γ)γ′(σ(s)) · λ′(s) ≥ 1, and if not, then

1 − f (δ2

|γ′(σ(s)) − λ′(s)|2.

Either way, it follows that

|γ′(σ(s)) − λ′(s)|2.

(56)

Next, recalling that (x − γ(ζ(x)) · γ′(ζ(x)) = 0, we have

It easily follows from this and (55) that in fact δΓ(s) < Rγ for all s, when ε is small
enough, and hence (53) holds.

Moreover, we integrate over (56), use the deﬁnition of Eγ(Λ, t) and the estimate

(53), and get

ZR/Z

(59)

with ¯σ = ¯σ(t) = σ(0, t), because kγ′kL∞ + kγ′′kL∞ < ∞. It thus remains to prove

σ′(s) = ∇ζ(λ(s)) · λ′(s) =

γ′(σ(s)) · λ′(s)

1 − (λ(s) − γ(σ(s)) · γ′′(σ(s))

.

Recalling that |γ′′(s)| ≤ rγ(s) ≤ Rγ, we use (53) to deduce

|1 − σ′(s)| ≤ 1 − γ′(σ(s)) · λ′(s) + O(| log ε|−1).

Thus k1 − σ′kL1 . Eγ(Λ) . | log ε|−1. Using the continuous embedding of W 1,1 into

4.5 Proof of Proposition 1

In this subsection, we provide the proof of Proposition 1. Notice that the statement
in (23) was established in Lemma 7 in Section 4.2. The remaining estimates (24)
will be proved in Lemma 9 and estimates (25) and (26) will be proved in Lemma
12.

In our computations we will occasionally encounter error terms of the form
kg(κ∗)kL1(R/Z), where for example g(t) = | log t|p for some p ≥ 1. These can al-
ways be absorbed into the kκ∗kL1,∞ term, since (recalling that κ∗ ≥ 1 everywhere)
we have

We now start to establish pointwise estimates of vε. We begin with rather crude
estimates that are valid everywhere; these will be suﬃcient for Lq estimates of vε,
for q > 2. For q = 2, we will later prove sharper estimates in the tube T .

We can now establish Lq estimates of vε for q > 2.

Lemma 9. Estimates (24) hold.

Proof. Inequality (24) in the case q = ∞ is already contained in the previous lemma.
For q < ∞, we will write H 0(Γ) := {x ∈ R

3 : dist(x, Γ) < ε} and

H j(Γ) := {x ∈ R

3 : 2j−1ε ≤ dist(x, Γ) < 2jε},

for j ≥ 1.

Then clearly

We set Nr(Γ) := {x ∈ R

|Nr(Γ)| . r2 + r3.

Indeed, if we let M = ⌊1/r⌋, then

Nr(Γ) ⊂

M[k=0

where pk := γ(kr).

Thus |Nr(Γ)| . (M + 1)r3 . (1/r + 1)r3, proving (61). We now ﬁx J such that
2Jε ≤ 1 ≤ 2J+1ε, and we use Lemma 8 to estimate

Moreover, with the help of (61) we obtain

|vε| . min(cid:8)(2jε)−2, (2jε)−1kκ∗kL1,∞(cid:9) in H j(Γ).

We thus obtain (24) by summing over j.

We require sharper estimates for the L2 norms of vε and associated quantities,

and for these we establish a more precise description of vε in the tube T .

Proof. Fix x ∈ T with dist(x, Γ) > ε. We use the same notation as in the proof of

For notational convenience, we assume in the following discussion that ζ(x) = 0 and
we set δ := dist(x, Γ) and r0 := r(0) = r(ζ(x)). Then deﬁning γ0(s) = γ(0) + sγ′(0),
we see that

The last integral in (62) can be estimated by exactly the arguments in the proof of
Lemma 8, leading to

To evaluate the ﬁrst integral in (62), we observe that since (γ(0) − x) · γ′(0) = 0,

for δ ≤ r0. So it only remains to estimate the second integral in (62). By the mean
value theorem (of calculus), we may write the integrand as

| log ε| + O(kκ∗k2

Proof. Let G denote the Newtonian potential G(z) = 1
4π|z|, and deﬁne Φ := G ∗ µΓ,
so that −∆Φ = µΓ. Then we can write vε = ρε ∗ ∇ × Φ = ∇ × ρε ∗ Φ. It is easy
to see, by arguing as in the proof of Lemma 8, that |Φ(x)| . |x|−1 for |x| large,
and together with the conclusions of Lemma 8, this gives suﬃcient decay to justify
integrating by parts as follows:

Z |vε|2dx =Z ∇ × (ρε ∗ Φ) · vε dx =Z ρε ∗ Φ · ∇ × vε dx

=Z ρε ∗ Φ · ρε ∗ µΓ dx =Z ρε ∗ ρε ∗ Φ · dµΓ.

In the last identity, we have used the radial symmetry of ρε. Setting ηε := ρε ∗ ρε,
it follows that

Z |vε|2 dx ≤ZR/Z

|ηε ∗ Φ(γ(s))| ds =ZR/Z

|(ηε ∗ G ∗ µΓ)(γ(s))| ds.

Below we will repeatedly use the facts that

for every |x| > 2ε,

(65)

The ﬁrst of these follows from the mean value property for harmonic functions, and
the second is easy to verify.

Now consider an arbitrary point in R/Z, which we take for convenience to be

s = 0, and let x := γ(0). Then

|(ηε ∗ G ∗ µΓ)(x)| ≤Z 1/2

Let r0 := r(0). If r0 < 4ε, then we use (65) and Lemma 4 to compute

Arguing as in the proof of (66) above, it follows from (65) and Lemma 4 that

Zr0<|s|≤ 1

where we have used the fact that r(s) ≤ 1

2 for all s to simplify the error terms.

Notice that in view of the second estimate in (63) (applied both with λ = 0 and
λ = 1), we have F (s) = G(x − γ(s)) − G(x − γ0(s)) for 4ε ≤ |s| ≤ r0. Hence, there
exists some γλ(s), a convex combination of γ0(s) and γ(s), such that

F (s) = ∇G(x − γλ(s)) · (γ(s) − γ0(s)) .

|γ(s) − γ0(s)|
|x − γλ(s)|2 .

33

Again using (63), we ﬁnd that F (s) . 1

by (65) for all s, we thus obtain

if 4ε ≤ |s| ≤ r0. Since F (s) . 1

Combining these, we ﬁnd that if r0 ≥ 4ε, then

|(ηε ∗ G ∗ µΓ)(γ(s))| ≤

Recalling (64) and (66), we can now integrate and recall (60) to ﬁnd that

The statement follows because ε| log ε| ≤ 1.

The following Lemma completes the proof of Proposition 1.

Lemma 12. Estimates (25) and (26) hold.

Proof. We ﬁrst claim that it suﬃces to show that

(67)

Indeed, if this holds, then we may take φ = I in (67) to ﬁnd that

|vε|2 dx = O(cid:0)kκ∗k2

and from this we see that (67) implies (26). Similarly, combining the previous two
estimates, we directly obtain (25).

To prove (67), we ﬁrst use the coarea formula to rewrite the integral on the

left-hand side as

ZT

φ : vε ⊗ vε dx =ZR/Z(cid:18)Zζ −1(s)

φ : vε ⊗ vε |∇ζ|−1dH2(cid:19) ds.

We now consider some s ∈ R/Z.
γ(s) = 0 and γ′(s) = (0, 0, 1). We will also write r = (x2
that r = dist(x, Γ) in ζ −1(s). In these coordinates,

It is convenient to choose coordinates so that

We henceforth restrict our attention to s for which this holds. We therefore have

Indeed, it is clear that any term involving the 3rd component of v∗ must vanish.
Among the remaining terms, symmetry considerations imply that the oﬀ-diagonal
