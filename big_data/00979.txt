We deﬁne a mean-ﬁeld semantics for S-PALPS, a process calculus for spatially-explicit, individual-
based modeling of ecological systems. The new semantics of S-PALPS allows an interpretation of
the average behavior of a system as a set of recurrence equations. Recurrence equations are a useful
approximation when dealing with a large number of individuals, as it is the case in epidemiological
studies. As a case study, we compute a set of recurrence equations capturing the dynamics of an
individual-based model of the transmission of dengue in Bello (Antioquia), Colombia.

Introduction

The collective evolution of a group of individuals is of importance in many ﬁelds; for instance, in system
biology, ecology and epidemiology. When modeling such systems, we want to know the emergent
behaviors of the whole population given a description of the low-level interactions of the individuals in
the system. As an example, in eco-epidemiology the focus is on the number of individuals infected in a
certain population and how a small number of individuals infected may lead to an epidemic.

Eco-epidemiology can be seen as a particular case of population ecology. The main aim of population
ecology is to gain a better understanding of population dynamics and make predictions about how pop-
ulations will evolve and how they will respond to speciﬁc management schemes. In eco-epidemiology,
such management schemes can be a cure to a disease, mechanisms to prevent a disease such as vaccines,
or mechanisms to prevent the vector (species infected with a disease) to spread a disease. To achieve
these goals, scientists may construct models of ecosystems and management schemes (e.g., [33]).

Various formalisms have been proposed in the literature for the individual-based modeling of biolog-
ical and ecological systems. Examples of such formalisms include the calculus of looping sequences [7]
and its spatial extension [6], cellular automata [14, 11], Petri nets [17], synchronous automata [13], P
systems [9, 8, 25] and process calculi (or process algebras) [28, 19].

In our work, we are interested in the application of process calculi for studying the population dynam-
ics of ecological systems. Process calculi are formal frameworks to model and reason about concurrent
systems and provide constructs to express sequential and parallel composition of processes, as well as
different means of communication between processes. In contrast to the traditional approach to modeling
ecological systems using ordinary differential equations which describe a system in terms of changes in
the population as a whole, process calculi are suited towards the so-called “individual-based” modeling
of populations. Process calculi enable one to describe the evolution of each individual of the popula-
tion as a process and, subsequently, to compose a set of individuals (as well as their environment) into
a complete ecological system. Process calculi include features such as time [27, 22], probability [29]
and stochastic behavior [16]. Furthermore, following a model construction, one can use model-checking

tools for automatically analyzing properties of the models (e.g., [20, 31]) as opposed to just simulating
trajectories, as it is typically carried out in most ecological studies.

In a previous work, we presented PALPS (Process Algebra with Locations for Population Systems),
a process calculus developed for modeling and reasoning about spatially-explicit individual-based sys-
tems [24]. In PALPS, individuals are modeled using discrete time and probabilistic behavior, and space
is modeled as a graph of discrete locations. We associated PALPS with a translation to the probabilistic
model checker PRISM [3] to perform more advanced analysis of ecological models. Our experiments
with PALPS [24, 23] delivered promising results via the use of statistical model checking provided by
PRISM. Nonetheless, the results also revealed a limitation: the interleaving nature of the parallel com-
position operator led to a high level of nondeterminism and, thus, a very quick explosion of the state
space. Moreover, the interleaving nature of PALPS comes in contrast to the usual approach of modeling
adopted by ecologists where it is considered that execution evolves in phases during which individuals
of a population engage simultaneously in some process, such as birth, dispersal and reproduction.

To alleviate the problem of the interleaving nature of parallel composition and the high degree of
nondeterminism in PALPS, we proposed a new semantics of PALPS, which captures more faithfully the
synchronous evolution of populations and removes as much unnecessary nondeterminism as possible.
Our proposal consisted of a synchronous extension of PALPS, named synchronous PALPS (S-PALPS)
[31]. The semantics of S-PALPS implements the concept of maximum parallelism: at any given time all
individuals that may execute an action will do so simultaneously [31]. Furthermore, we proposed a new
translation of S-PALPS to PRISM which implemented this synchronous semantics, as well as other features
that removed the restrictions existing in the original framework. This led to a signiﬁcant improvement
regarding the size of S-PALPS models that can by analyzed via translation to PRISM in the range of
hundreds of individuals. However, in epidemiological systems, components can number in millions.

To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we present a mean-ﬁeld semantics to represent the average
behavior of S-PALPS systems for populations of potentially millions of individuals. Mean-ﬁeld semantics
gives a deterministic approximation of the average behavior of a system, given low-level speciﬁcations
at the individual level in terms of discrete-time and discrete-space mean-ﬁeld equations. In this work
we propose an algorithm of polynomial-time complexity for producing the mean-ﬁeld equations given
an S-PALPS model of a system. The algorithm avoids computing the complete state-space of a system
and its complexity is independent of the size of the populations. Rather, given the stochastic nature of
the systems in question, the accuracy of the method relies on the fact that the numbers of each agent in
the system are sufﬁciently large. We illustrate the application of our semantics for the construction of
mean-ﬁeld equations of an S-PALPS model of the transmission of dengue in Bello, Colombia.

Mean-ﬁeld semantics have been proposed for a number of process calculi including PEPA [16, 32]
and WSCCS [29, 20]. The former line of work differs from our semantics since the underlying model is
continuous time. Instead, our work is closely related to that of [20] for WSCCS. Our semantics extends
that of [20] in two ways. First, we extend the semantics of S-PALPS to deal with locations, since S-PALPS
includes an explicit notion of discrete space not present in WSCCS. Second, the nature of our calculus and,
speciﬁcally, the presence of an explicit probabilistic operator, as opposed to weights, and the absence of
nondeterminism at the level of individuals, yields a simpler semantics, as well as the lifting of some of
the restrictions imposed in [20]. As related work, we also mention the mean-ﬁeld semantics proposed for
reactive networks in [12] which, however, is not directly related with our aim of providing this analysis
capability to the spatially-explicit process calculus S-PALPS.

The remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the syntax and the semantics of
S-PALPS. In Section 3 we present a mean-ﬁeld semantics for S-PALPS. We apply our techniques to study
the population dynamics of dengue in Section 5. Section 6 presents conclusions and future work.

2 Synchronous PALPS

In S-PALPS, we consider a system as a set of individuals operating in space, each belonging to a certain
species and inhabiting a location. Individuals who reside at the same location may communicate with
each other upon channels (e.g., for preying) or they may migrate to a new location. S-PALPS models
probabilistic events with the aid of a probabilistic operator.

The syntax of S-PALPS is based on the following basic entities: (1) S is a set of species ranged over
by s, s′. (2) Loc is a set of locations ranged over by ℓ, ℓ′. The habitat is then implemented via a relation
Nb, where (ℓ, ℓ′) ∈ Nb exactly when ℓ and ℓ′ are neighbors. (3) Ch is a set of channels ranged over by
lower-case strings. The syntax of S-PALPS is given at two levels, the individual level ranged over by P
and the system level ranged over by S which are deﬁned as follows:

P ::= 0 | h .P | •(cid:229)
i∈I
S ::= 0 | P:hs, ℓ,qi | S1kS2 | S\L

pi:Pi | g ? (P1,P2) | P1|P2 | C

where L ⊆ Ch, I is an index set, pi ∈ (0,1] with (cid:229)
each with an associated deﬁnition of the form C def

i∈I pi = 1, C ranges over a set of process constants C ,
= P, and the actions that a process can perform are

h

::= a | a | go ℓ | √

g ::= a | a

Beginning with the individual level, P can be one of the following:
• Process 0 represents the inactive individual, that is, an individual who has ceased to exist.
• Process h .P describes the action-preﬁxed process which executes action h before proceeding as
P. An activity h can be an input action on a channel a, written simply as a; an output action on a
channel a, written as a; a movement action to location ℓ, go ℓ; or the tick action √ that indicates
a discrete-time unit on a global tick action, √. Actions of the form a, and a, a ∈ Ch, are used to
model activities performed by an individual; for instance, preying and reproduction.
• Process •(cid:229)
i∈I pi:Pi represents the probabilistic choice between processes Pi, i ∈ I. The process
randomly selects an index i ∈ I with probability pi, and then evolves to process Pi. We write
p1:P1 ⊕ p2:P2 for the binary form of this operator.
• Process g ? (P1,P2) depends on the availability of a communication on a certain channel as de-
scribed by g . If a communication is available according to g then the communication is executed
and the ﬂow of control proceeds according to P1. If not, the process proceeds as P2. This operator
is a deterministic operator as, in any scenario, the process g ? (P1,P2) proceeds as either P1 or P2
but not both, depending on the availability of the complementary action of g in the environment in
which the process is running.

Moving on to the population level, population systems are built by composing in parallel sets of
located individuals. A set of q individuals of species s located at location ℓ is deﬁned as P:hs, ℓ,qi. In a
composition S1kS2 the components may proceed while synchronizing on their actions following a set of
restrictions. These restrictions enforce that probabilistic transitions take precedence over the execution
of other actions and that time proceeds synchronously in all components of a system. That is, for S1kS2
to execute a √ action, both S1 and S2 must be willing to execute √. Action √ measures a tick on a global
clock. These time steps are abstract in the sense that they do not necessarily have a deﬁned length and,
in practice, √ is used to separate the rounds of an individual’s behavior. In the case of multi-species
systems these actions must be carefully placed in order to synchronize species with possibly different
time scales.

System S\L models the restriction of channels in L within S. This construct is important to deﬁne
valid systems: We deﬁne a valid system to be any process of the form S\L where, for all of S’s subpro-
cesses of the form a?(P,Q) and a?(P,Q) we have that a ∈ L. Hereafter, we consider only valid systems.
Example 1. Let us consider a species s where individuals cycle through a dispersal phase followed by a
reproduction phase. Further, suppose that the habitat is a ring of size m where the neighbors of location
ℓ are ℓ± 1. In S-PALPS, we may model s by P0, where

According to the previous deﬁnition, during the dispersal phase, an individual moves to a neighbor-
ing location which is chosen probabilistically among the neighboring locations of the current location
(myloc) of the individual. Subsequently, the ﬂow of control proceeds according to P1 which models the
probabilistic production of one offspring (case of P0|P0) or two offspring (case of P0|P0|P0). A system
that contains two individuals at a location ℓ and one at location ℓ′ can be modeled as

System def

= P0:hs, ℓ,2i|P0:hs, ℓ′,1i .

The semantics of S-PALPS is deﬁned operationally via two transition relations, the non-deterministic
transition relation and the probabilistic transition relation yielding transition systems that can be easily
translated into Markov decision processes [26]. The main features of the semantics is that probabilistic
transitions take precedence over all other actions and that all processes must synchronize on timed actions.
Finally, at any given time, all individuals that may execute an action will do so simultaneously. A full
account of the semantics can be found in [31].

3 Mean-ﬁeld semantics for S-PALPS

Using the operational semantics of S-PALPS, we can study the transient dynamics of a system: the time
series evolution of the model. This is necessary for the simulation of models that can be obtained by
translating S-PALPS to PRISM. Using PRISM it is also possible to use model checking or approximated
model checking (i.e., statistical model checking). Although this approach can be effective for S-PALPS
models with fairly large state spaces (consisting of populations in the range of a few hundreds of in-
dividuals), the size of a state space is exponential in the number of components and locations, and, in
epidemiological systems, components can number in millions. To address this challenge, in this section
we develop a mean-ﬁeld semantics for S-PALPS which can be used for reasoning about systems with
very large populations. To compute the mean-ﬁeld semantics, we proceed in 3 steps: (1) compute the
initial-state matrix, (2) compute the state-transition table and (3) compute the mean-ﬁeld equations. In
particular, we begin by assuming an S-PALPS model of the form:

System = (P

1≤ j≤mP1:hs1, ℓ j,q1, ji| . . .|P

1≤ j≤mPn:hsn, ℓ j,qn, ji)\L

where P1, . . . ,Pn, is the set of all processes the populations may evolve into, s1, . . . ,sn ∈ S, ℓ1, . . . , ℓm ∈ Loc
is the set of all locations in the system, and the qi, j ≥ 0 are the sizes of the population of individuals at
state Pi at location ℓ j where, if a location-state pair (Pi, ℓ j) for some species s is not present in the initial
conﬁguration then System includes the component Pi:hs, ℓ j,0i.
Restrictions for our method are the following: as usual, the numbers of the agents qi must be sufﬁ-
ciently large and process constants must be guarded. That is, we do not allow deﬁnitions of the form
C def

= P|C, since these yield inﬁnite-sized systems.

1. Initial-state matrix (Init).
This matrix, Init, captures the initial conﬁguration of the system under
study by noting the number of individuals of each type at each location. It is a matrix of size n×m, where
n is the number of all accessible process-states and m the number of distinct locations in the system (see
the deﬁnition of System above) and it is obtained directly from the deﬁnition of System. Speciﬁcally,
Init[i, j] = q where q is the number of individuals of state Pi at location ℓ j.

2. State-transition table (STT).
This 3-dimensional table, STT, shows how processes evolve from one
state to another and how their locations change. Each entry in the state-transition table is an expression
that captures the average evolution, after the execution of a single action of a process P at a location ℓ to
some process Q at a location ℓ′. This is expressed as a function of the size of the population of process
P. Formally, matrix STT is of size n× n× m. We point out again that n is the number of different states
individuals may engage in and m the number of locations in a system. Note that while these quantities
may be big, if we are considering a detailed model of a system (many process states and large number
of locations), typically, they are fairly small and, most importantly, they are independent of the size of
the populations considered as well as the size of the system under consideration. This matrix captures
the evolution after one action step and not necessarily after a time unit, since actions under study may
include actions such as go ℓ, communication actions and probabilistic actions. The entries of the matrix
are expressions that capture the number of processes of a certain type that have evolved at a location
as a function of the number of various processes at different locations that may evolve into the speciﬁc
state-location pair, in the previous step of the system.

In order to capture the evolution in a manner compatible with the original S-PALPS semantics, we
employ the following notions: timed(S) captures whether S may engage in a timed action (all its active
components may execute √); prob(S) captures whether S may engage in a probabilistic actions (at least
one of its components may execute a probabilistic action). These notions are essential to capture that
probabilistic actions take precedence over all other actions and that √ actions may take place only if all
components of the system are willing to synchronize on a timed step. In particular, given a system S, to
construct the values of the transition matrix STT capturing the evolution of its components Pi:hsi, ℓi,qii
we use a function [[·]] : Proc × Act → P(Expr : Proc), where Proc is the set of all processes of the
form P:hs, ℓ,qi and Expr is an expression capturing the evolution in question.
In particular, given a
process P:hs, ℓ,qi and an action a , [[P:hs, ℓ,qi,a ]] returns a set of expressions ei : Pi:hs, ℓi,qii capturing
the set of processes in which P:hs, ℓ,qi may evolve and the concentration ei for each of these processes
as a function of the concentration of P:hs, ℓ,qi. We proceed to deﬁne this function. We begin with the
evolution according to probabilistic transitions and timed actions, where we have:

[[P:hs, ℓ,qi,a)]] = hi,

if prob(S)

[[P:hs, ℓ,qi, prob]] = hpi · Pt : Pi:hs, ℓ,qi|i ∈ Ii,
[[P:hs, ℓ,qi,√]] = hPt : P′:hs, ℓ,qii,
[[P:hs, ℓ,qi,√]] = hi,

if P = √.P′ and ¬timed(S)

if P = •(cid:229)
i∈I

pi:Pi

if P = √.P′ and timed(S)

Thus, no communication on channel a may take place if a process occurs within a system satisfying
prob(S). Similarly, a √ action may not take place if the process does not occur within a system satisfying
timed(S). On the other hand, probabilistic transitions may take place freely and so do √ actions within
timed systems. Note that in the above, we write Pt for the number of agents P at step t.

Moving on to the execution of a movement action, we deﬁne:

[[P:hs, ℓ,qi,t go,ℓ]] = hPt : P′:hs, ℓ′,qii,

if P = go ℓ′.P′

84

Mean-FieldSemanticsforaProcessCalculusforEcologicalModels

This leaves us with the execution of channel-based actions where we distinguish the following cases:

• If P = h .P′, where h ∈ {a,a} and a 6∈ L, that is a does not belong to the set of restricted channels,

then we have

[[P:hs, ℓ,qi,h ]] = hPt : P′:hs, ℓ,qii,

if P = h .P′

• If P = h .P′ where h ∈ {a,a} and a ∈ L, then the number of agents evolving to P′ depends on
the number of agents co-located with P and available to execute action h and the complementary
action h . Let us write Xt for the number of co-located agents able to execute h and Yt for the
number of co-located agents able to execute the complementary action h . If Yt ≥ q + Xt then all
agents of type P will proceed to state P′. If not, then the mean change in agent P is expressed as

(cid:229) q

(cid:229) q

k=1 k(cid:18)q
k=1(cid:18)q

k(cid:19)(cid:18) Xt
Yt − k(cid:19)
k(cid:19)(cid:18) Xt
Yt − k(cid:19)

This term can be simpliﬁed using Vandermonde’s Convolution and standard theory regarding the
binomial coefﬁcient to q·Yt
Xt

[15]. Thus, we have:

[[h .P:hs, ℓ,qi,h ]] = hmin(q,

q·Yt
Xt

) : P′:hs, ℓ,qii

• Finally, we have to consider the evolution of a P = g ?(P1,P2) process. In such processes, we know
that g ∈ {a,a} where a ∈ L. Thus, the evolution is similar to the previous case. The point in which
this case differs is when there is not a sufﬁcient number of collaborating agents to provide the
complementary g actions. In such a case, a number of instances of the process will evolve to P2
thus, giving:

[[g ?(P1,P2):hs, ℓ,qi,h ]] = hmin(q,

q·Yt
Xt

) : P1:hs, ℓ,qi, (q− min(q,

q·Yt
Xt

)) : P2:hs, ℓ,qii

3. Mean-ﬁeld equations (MFEs). Using the state-transition table and the initial-state matrix, we can
derive a set of recurrence equations that represent the mean-ﬁeld semantics of a system. The system of
recurrence equations contains one variable for each different process and at each location in a system.
A variable Pi(t)@ℓ j represents the mean number of individuals of process Pi:hs, ℓ j,m′i, at time t and
location ℓ j and a variable P(t − 1)@ℓ j represents the number of individuals of process Pi at location ℓ j
during time t − 1. Formally, Pi(t)@ℓ j is deﬁned by

Pi(t)@ℓ j =(cid:26)

Init[i, j]

t = 0

(cid:229) 1≤k≤n STT[k][i][ℓ j] otherwise

In the ﬁrst case, for t = 0, the value is obtained from the initial-state matrix. The second case, for
t > 0, the value is obtained from state-transition from all the processes in the system. According to the
state-transition table, processes that do not derive into P′:hs, ℓ,m′i are said to produce 0 individuals of
process P′:hs, ℓ,m′i in the next time unit.
Algorithm 1 is the pseudocode to construct the state-transition table STT. For simplicity, we assume
that the entries of the state-transition table are expressions over the number of individuals of each process.

Theorem 1. The complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(n2 · m) where n is the number of different states individ-
uals may engage in and m the number of different locations in the system.

Proof. The algorithm consists of a loop that ﬁlls in the positions of the 3-dimensional matrix STT. As-
suming that by some preprocessing we have the set of processes executing the actions h and h of interest,
each value of the matrix can be computed at constant time, yielding the result.

Example 2.

In what follows we present the mean-ﬁeld semantics of Example 1. In this example, we

have a total of 7 process states: R1 = P0, R2 = go (myloc + 1).R4, R3 = go (myloc − 1).R4, R4 = √.P1,
R5 = P1, R6 = √.(P0|P0) and R7 = √.(P0|P0|P0). Furthermore, let us assume that the habitat is a ring of

size 4.

1. In the initial-state, there are 2 individuals of process P0 at location 1 and 1 individual of process P0

at location 2. This is represented in the following 4× 7 initial-state matrix:

[[2,0,0,0,0,0,0], [1, 0,0,0,0, 0,0], [0,0,0, 0,0,0,0], [0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0]]

2. Using the methodology deﬁned above, the transition matrix for the example is given below. Note
that in fact this is a 3-dimensional matrix, the third dimension being the location dimension. To
capture this in two dimensions we write @ℓ′ whenever the resulting individuals have moved to
another location, ℓ′ being this location.

and 0, if t = 0 and i 6= 1 or ℓ 6∈ {1,2}, whereas if t > 0 we have:

By manipulating the equations and restricting attention to how the system evolves between √

4 Correctness of the mean-ﬁeld semantics

In this section, we prove the correctness of our mean-ﬁeld semantics by establishing the relation between
the derived mean-ﬁeld equations and the S-PALPS semantics. To achieve this, we ﬁrst deﬁne an encoding
of the operational semantics of S-PALPS into a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Then we show that
the recurrence equations obtained from the mean-ﬁeld semantics of S-PALPS are equivalent to the recur-
rence equations obtained from DTMC-semantics of S-PALPS. This follows a result of [18], according to
which it is possible to derive ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as an approximation of the average
behavior of a DTMC. At the limit, where the DTMC consists of inﬁnitely many agents, the mean of the
DTMC is equivalent to the derived ODE’s.

Derivation of a DTMC from a S-PALPS system. The semantics of S-PALPS is given operationally
via a structural operational semantics [31]. This semantics is given in terms of two transition relations,
a non-deterministic transition relation and a probabilistic transition relation, which give rise to labeled
transition systems that present both non-deterministic and probabilistic states. In the context of this work,
we present a method for interpreting such transition systems as a DTMC, under an abstract bisimulation.

Essentially, an abstract bisimulation is an equivalence relation that allows us to disregard the structure
of the non-deterministic choices and just look at the probabilities of reaching any particular state. This
approach to derive a DTMC from a probabilistic process calculus, was proposed ﬁrst by Tofts for process
calculus WSCCS [29].

To begin with, we deﬁne an abstract notion of evolution as follows:

P

b [p]
−→ P′ if an only if P p1−→p P1

p2−→p . . .

pn−1−→p Pn−1

pn−→p Pn

b

−→ P′ where p = (cid:213)

1≤i≤n

pi

We lift this notion to evolution into a set of processes as follows, where S is a set of S-PALPS processes:

P

b [p]

−→ S if an only if p = (cid:229)

{pi | Pi

b [pi]
−→ P,P ∈ S}

We may now deﬁne the notion of abstract bisimulation as follows:

Deﬁnition 1. An equivalence relation R ⊆ Pr× Pr is an abstract bisimulation if (P,Q) ∈ R implies that
for all equivalence classes S ∈ Pr /R, actions b , and for all p ∈ [0,1], P
abstract bisimulation R such that (P,Q) ∈ R.

We say that two processes are abstract bisimulation equivalent, written P ∼ Q, if there exists an

b [p]
−→ S if and only Q

b [p]
−→ S.

This relation can be used to translate any S-PALPS system into a DTMC: by building an abstract
bisimulation on the set of states of the system, we obtain a DTMC whose states are the equivalence
classes of the equivalences relation and the transition labels are b [p], as deﬁned above.

We now turn to proving the relation between the DTMC semantics and the mean-ﬁeld semantics
of S-PALPS. To do this we refer to [18] where limit theorems were presented relating the mean of
Continuous Time Markov Chains and Discrete Time Markov Chains to ordinary differential equations.
In particular [18] shows that, at the limit, where a DTMC consists of inﬁnitely many agents, the mean
of the Markov chain is equivalent to a derived set of ODEs. An intermediate step of Kurtzs proof
produces terms equivalent to those of our mean-ﬁeld semantics. We use this to show the correctness of
our semantics. In particular, we refer to a result of [18] capturing the conditions under which the limit
theorem holds and then verify that these conditions apply to S-PALPS models. The theorem states the
following:
Theorem 2. Let Xn(k) be a sequence of discrete time Markov processes with measurable state spaces
(En, Bn), En ∈ Bk, the Borel sets in Rk and one step transition functions denoted by

m n(x,G ) = P{Xn(k + 1) ∈ G

where Fn(x) = a nREn(z− x)m n(x,dz).

Proof of correctness. We recall, from Section 3, that restrictions are as usual when dealing with mean
ﬁeld approximations: the numbers of the agents must be sufﬁciently large and process constants must
be guarded to avoid inﬁnite-sized systems. Essentially, this result proves that, assuming that the various
conditions hold, the difference between state changes in the Markov chain and the ones expressed in the
relevant ODE are in fact equivalent.

Theorem 3. Given System = (P
1≤ j≤mPn:hsn, ℓ j,qn, ji)\L in S-PALPS, the sys-
tem of recurrence equations with variables P1(t)@ℓ1 . . . P1(t)@ℓm, . . . ,Pn(t)@ℓ1, . . . Pn(t)@ℓm represents
the average behavior of the system at any discrete-time unit t.

Proof. We show that the recurrence equations obtained from the mean-ﬁeld semantics of S-PALPS are
equivalent to the recurrence equations obtained from the mean-ﬁeld approximation of the derivation of
S-PALPS’s operational semantics into a DTMC.

To do this we must conﬁrm that the condition of the theorem above are satisﬁed.
1. According to the theorem, we require a set of DTMC processes Xn(k). Indeed, the states of an
S-PALPS system is in Nk, where k is the number of different processes in the system times the
number of locations. This is a consequence of the initial-state matrix deﬁned in Section 3.

each element by n and letting n → ¥

2. When considering processes over {0,1, . . . ,n}, Kurtz rescales such processes to [0,1] by dividing
. Processes in a system of S-PALPS range over {0,1, . . . ,n},
where n is the number of different processes in the system times the number of locations. They
can also be rescaled to match the deﬁned conditions.

3. According to the theorem, the one step transition function is represented by m x(x,G ) = P{Xn(k +
|Xn(k) = x}. If we consider the labelled-transition system of S-PALPS under abstract bisim-

1) ∈ G
ulation, the one step transition function can be extracted as m n(P,{P′|P

4. Finally, the theorem assumes that there exists sequence of positive numbers a n and e n such that

b [p]

a n = ¥

e n = 0, and

|z− x|m n(x,dz) = 0

In terms of S-PALPS, we can think of x and z being state matrices with a component representing
each type of process in the system at each location. The term |z−x| denotes the difference between
the two states x and z. As n → ¥
, the number of states that can be reached in one step becomes
very large. Furthermore, there is higher probability of moving to a state with small change from

M.Toro,A.Philippou,S.Arboleda,M.Puerta&C.V´elez

89

the previous state when there are lots of components since there are lots of ways to make that
change. Similarly, the states for which the change is high are less likely to occur. In addition we

have that, since process are rescaled to [0,1], then 0 ≤ |x− z| ≤ 1, and since m (x,z) is a probability,
we conclude that 0 ≤ m (x,z) ≤ 1. Given the relation of probabilities and degree of changes noted
above, we conclude that REn |z − x|m n(x,dz) → 0 and that as n and a n tend to inﬁnity, a nREn |z −
x|m n(x,dz) < ¥
states for which m (x,z) = 0.
Thus, by Theorem 2, for every d > 0, t > 0, we have

as required. Similarly, we may verify the last relation by noting that it captures the

k≤a nt|Xn(1)− Xn(0)−ZEn
P{ sup
, the difference Xn(1)− Xn(0)−REn(z− x)m n(x,dz) tends to 0, therefore
This implies that as n → ¥

So, ﬁnally, by noting that REn(z− x)m n(x,dz) is equivalent to the way the mean-ﬁeld equations of

Section 3 are constructed, the result follows.

5 Case study: Population dynamics of dengue in Bello, Colombia

An interesting case study where system components can number in millions is the eco-epidemiology of
dengue. Dengue is a disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by the bite of the Aedes aegypti
mosquito. To date, there is no available treatment nor speciﬁc vaccine for this disease. Dengue is a
serious public health problem in Colombia. During the last 10 years, there were around 600,000 cases,
from which 9% corresponded to aggravated forms of the disease [2]. Unfortunately, current programs
to prevent and control dengue in Colombia are insufﬁcient [1]. In the Valley of Aburr´a (Department of
Antioquia), the city of Bello is one of the most affected by dengue. In Bello, dengue is endemic; the rate
oscillated from 11.1 to 427 cases by 100,000 inhabitants, during the years 2002-2009.

Given the endemic status of dengue in Bello, it is important to analyze the factors involved in the
eco-epidemiology of the dengue disease. Previous results have shown the inﬂuence of environmental
variables in the distributions of cases of the disease [4]. Ongoing work carried out by three of the
authors, Arboleda, Puerta and V´elez, aims to analyze the macro and micro climatic and population
factors to determine cases of dengue in Bello1. There is a disadvantage with such models: the models
are population models based on differential equations; it means, that they analyze the average behavior

of the populations, but it is not possible to know how low-level speciﬁcations at the individual level will
affect the population behavior.

The model we present is an individual-based version of the model presented in [33]. To establish
the initial conditions for the model deﬁned with respect to the human population, we adopted a total
population size of 403,235, as recorded for the urban area of Bello (Antioquia) in 2010 by the Colombian
administrative department of statistics 2. The size of the susceptible human population at the beginning
of the last registered epidemic was estimated based on the risk map developed by Arboleda et al. [5], in
which the probability of infection was reported to be 0.3 in 2008 and 2009, with a standard deviation
of 0.096; thus, it was determined that the size of the susceptible human population should be between
244,402 and 321,734. The initial condition considered for the infectious human population was the
number of cases reported at the beginning of the epidemic. There were six reported cases in Bello during
the ﬁrst week of the epidemic (week 51 in 2009). Because of under-reporting concerns, which can affect
up to 75% of the total number of cases [10], we assumed that the initial number of infectious human
individuals should lie in the range of 6 to 24. In what follows we explain how we model the mosquitoes
and the humans.

Mosquitoes.
The aquatic phases of the mosquito’s life cycle are described brieﬂy. The egg, larva and
pupa states are represented by E, L and P, respectively. Parameters s e,s l,s p are the probabilities to
change from egg to larva, from larva to pupa and from pupa to adult. Co-action infect models when a
mosquito infects a human. We only consider female mosquitoes in the model. When a mosquito infects a
human, it may reproduce and produce 3 offspring; otherwise, it will die in the next time unit. Mosquitoes
can migrate from one district to another.

Humans.
The dynamics of dengue transmission in human population is described by susceptible
(s), exposed (e), infectious (i), recovered (r) and dead (d) individuals. Parameter m h represents the
probability of an infected human to die from the disease. Action infect represents the action of being
infected by a mosquito. When a human being is infected by a mosquito, it will remain in the exposed
state for 3 time units; afterwards, it will become infectious. For simplicity, we do not consider how
humans may infect mosquitoes when the mosquitoes bite on infected humans and we do not consider
how humans migrate among districts.

Mean-ﬁeld semantics.
In this case study, we have a total of 16 process states: E, L, P, W , W1 ... W5,
s, e, e1, e2, i, r, d, but only s,e,i,r,W,W2 are of interest. Furthermore, there are 11 districts in Bello,
Colombia, thus we have 11 locations.

1. The initial state is represented by a 11× 16 matrix.

2. The state-transition table for the example is given below. Note that in fact this is a 3-dimensional
matrix, the third dimension being the location dimension. To capture this in two dimensions we
write @ℓ′ whenever the resulting individuals have moved to another location, ℓ′ being this location.

First, we present the state transitions for the mosquitoes.

3. Let us write P(t)@ℓ for the average number of individuals of process P, at time t and location ℓ. In
what follows, we describe s(t)@ℓ, e(t)@ℓ ... W2(t)@ℓ, for t > 0, which represents the mean-ﬁeld
equations for the behavior of the mosquitoes and humans, respectively. Note that, for each process
of interest, we have 11 equations, one for each location that represents each district in Bello. A
detailed explanation on how we computed the mean-ﬁeld semantics of the case study is in [30].
By manipulating the equations and restricting attention to how the system evolves between √
actions and the processes of interest, we obtain:

Up to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst system of recurrence equations developed for dengue. We leave

as future work the validation of the model with real data.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a mean-ﬁeld semantics for S-PALPS. Up to our knowledge, S-PALPS is the
ﬁrst spatially-explicit probabilistic process calculus to be extended with mean-ﬁeld semantics. Using
this semantics we can analyze deterministically the average behavior of a spatially-explicit ecological
model even for large populations. The advantages of this new semantics is that it allows us to translate
from an individual-based model to the underlying population dynamics and that it is possible to do this
efﬁciently without computing the complete state space of the model. In particular, we showed how this
is applicable for epidemiological models by our case study on the transmission of dengue.

As future work, we want to further study the spatial distribution of dengue on the lines of Otero et
al. [21]. In fact, there is demographic and epidemiological information about the reported cases in each
district of Bello (Antioquia), Colombia. It is of vital importance for public health to determine which
districts have more risk by determining the migration patterns of mosquitoes from district to district. This
is of importance to deﬁne vaccination and fumigation schemes to prevent epidemics.
