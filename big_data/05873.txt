MILNOR INVARIANTS OF COVERING LINKS

NATSUKA KOBAYASHI, KODAI WADA AND AKIRA YASUHARA

Abstract. We consider Milnor invariants for certain covering links as a gener-
alization of covering linkage invariants formulated by R. Hartley and K. Mura-
sugi. A set of Milnor invariants for covering links is a cobordism invariant of
a link, and that this invariant can distinguish some links for which the ordi-
nary Milnor invariants coincide. Moreover, for a Brunnian link L, the ﬁrst
non-vanishing Milnor invariants of L is modulo-2 congruent to a sum of Mil-
nor invariants of covering links. As a consequence, a sum of linking numbers
of ‘iterated’ covering links gives the ﬁrst non-vanishing Milnor invariant of L
modulo 2.

1. Introduction

For a link L in the 3-sphere S3, we consider a branched cover of S3 branched
over components of L. The set of linking numbers between 2-component sublinks of

the preimage eL of L had been recognized as a useful invariant for knots and links,

see for example [2], [10], [16] and [17]. R. Hartley and K. Murasugi [9] called this
invariant the covering linkage invariant.

J. Milnor [12], [13] deﬁned a family of invariants for a link indexed by sequences of
integers in {1, 2, . . . , n}, where n is the number of components of the link. Since the
Milnor invariant of a link for a length two sequence ij coincides with the linking
number of the ith and jth components of the link, we could regard the Milnor
invariants for sequences with the length at least 3 as a kind of higher order linking
numbers.

So it seems to be natural to consider the Milnor invariants for (sublinks of) eL as

a generalization of covering linkage invariants. In fact, for a prime number p, T.D.
Cochran and K.E. Orr [6] deﬁned ‘mod p or p-adic versions’ Milnor invariants for
links in the Zp-homology 3-sphere. Their Milnor invariants can be also deﬁned for

eL in the p-fold cyclic branched cover of S3 branched over a component of L.
In order to investigate the ordinary Milnor invariants for eL, we only consider a

simple case as follows: Let L be a link with a trivial component K such that the
linking numbers between K and the other components are even. For the double
branched cover Σ(K) branched over K, a link in Σ(K) which consists of components
of the preimage of each component of L \ K is said to be a covering link. Note that
there are 2n−1 covering links in Σ(K), where n is the number of components of L.

(We remark that in [6], they call the preimage eL of L ‘the’ covering link.) Since

Σ(K) is also S3, we can deﬁne the ordinary Milnor invariants for each covering link.
It is known that the Milnor invariants are cobordism invariants [3]. It is also
true that a set of the Milnor invariants for certain covering links are cobordism
invariants of L (Theorem 3.1). In [6], Cochran and Orr show that their invariants

are (p-)cobordism invariants of the covering link eL.

In [6], they do not make it clear if their Milnor invariants of the covering link are
useful when the ordinary Milnor invariants are useless. Our invariants, the Milnor
invariants of a covering link, can distinguish some links for which the ordinary
Milnor invariants coincide, see Remark 7.2.

For a Brunnian link L in S3, we show that the ﬁrst non-vanishing Milnor invari-
ants of L is modulo-2 congruent to a sum of Milnor invariants of certain covering
links (Theorem 4.1). In [15], Murasugi proved that Milnor invariants of a link are
linking numbers in appropriate nilpotent covering spaces of S3 branched over the
link, i.e., he described the exact correspondence between Milnor invariants and cov-
ering linkage invariants. While it looks that our result is weaker than the result
of Murasugi, the authors believe that the result is worth mentioning because it is
hard to treat nilpotent covers in general.

2. Milnor invariants

Let L be an oriented ordered n-component link in S3. Let p be 0 or a prime
q a normal
q−1, where [x, y] is the
1 means G. (We remark that in [18], G is deﬁned to

number. Let G be the fundamental group of the complement of L and Gp
subgroup of G generated by [x, y]zp for x ∈ G, y, z ∈ Gp
commutator of x and y, and Gp
be Gp

It is shown by similar to Theorem 4 in [13] that the quotient group G/Gp

q is

0.)

isomorphic to a group with the following presentation:

hα1, α2, . . . , αn [αi, λq

i ](i = 1, 2, . . . , n), F p

q i,

where αi, λq
group generated by α1, α2, . . . , αn. In particular, λq
α1, α2, . . . , αn so that λq

i represent ith meridian and longitude of L respectively and F is a free
i can be chosen as a word in

i = λ0
i .

We introduce the Magnus Zp-expansion of λq

j . The Magnus Zp-expansion Ep
is an embedding homomorphism of F to the formal power series ring in non-
commutative variables X1, X2, . . . , Xn with Zp coeﬃcients deﬁned by E(αi) =
1 + Xi and E(α−1
i + · · · (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) [18, 6.1 Lemma].
Then Ep(λq

j ) can be written in the form

) = 1 − Xi + X 2

i − X 3

where a coeﬃcient µq
L(i1i2 · · · ikj)p is deﬁned for each sequence i1i2 · · · ikj of integers
in {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let 1 + f be the Magnus Zp-expansion of an element of F p
q . Then
the degree of any term in f is at least q (see [18, 6.2 Lemma]). This implies that
for q < q′

L(i1i2 · · · ikj)p = µq′
µq

L (i1i2 · · · ikj)p.

Taking q suﬃciently large, we may ignore q and hence denote µq
µL(i1i2 · · · ikj)p.

L(i1i2 · · · ikj)p by

For a sequence I = i1i2 · · · ikj (k < q), let ∆L(I)p be the ideal of Zp generated by
µ(J)p’s, where J is obtained from a proper subsequence of I by permuting cyclicly.
Then the Milnor invariant µL(I)p is deﬁned by

The length of µL(I)p means the length of I.

µL(I)p ≡ µL(I)p mod ∆L(I)p.

Remark 2.1. (1) The ordinary Milnor invariant µL(I) given in [12], [13] is equal to
µL(I)0. (In [13], ∆L(I)0 is deﬁned as the greatest common divisor of µL(J)0’s.)
When p is a prime number, ∆L(I)p is equal to either {0} or Zp since Zp is a
ﬁeld. Hence we essentially consider the ﬁrst non-vanishing of µL(I)p when p is
prime. Since G0
q for any prime number p, µL(I)p is the modulo-p reduction

q ⊂ Gp

of µL(I)0. Taking p suﬃciently large, we may regard that µL(I)p = µL(I)0 if
∆L(I)0 = {0}.

(2) In order to state our results, we only need the original deﬁnition by Milnor
[12], [13]. The deﬁnition in this section will be needed to apply a theorem of
Stallings [18, 5.1 Theorem] in the proof of Theorem 3.1.

3. Covering Milnor invariants

Let L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn+1 be an oriented (n + 1)-component link in S3 with
Kn+1 is trivial and linking numbers of Kn+1 and Ki are even for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Let Σ(Kn+1) be the double branched cover of S3 branched over Kn+1 and K ε
i (⊂
Σ(Kn+1)) a component of the preimage of Ki (ε ∈ {0, 1}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Then
we denote by L(ε1ε2 · · · εn) a link K ε1
n (εi ∈ {0, 1}) in Σ(Kn+1)
and call it a covering link of L. Since by the covering translation of Σ(Kn+1) there
is an bijection from {L(0ε2 · · · εn) | εi ∈ {0, 1}} to {L(1δ2 · · · δn) | δi ∈ {0, 1}},
we only consider the set {L(0ε2 · · · εn) | εi ∈ {0, 1}} in this section (and the last
section). It is obvious that the set {L(0ε2 · · · εn) | εi ∈ {0, 1}} is an invariant of L.
Note that Σ(Kn+1) is still S3 because the branch set Kn+1 is trivial. Hence Milnor
invariants are naturally deﬁned for covering links. In particular for a sequence I of
{1, 2, . . . , n}, ML(I)p = {µL(0ε2···εn)(I)p | εi ∈ {0, 1}} is an invariant of L, where
each element i of {2, . . . , n} corresponds to the subindex of K εi
i . We call ML(I)p
the covering Zp-Milnor invariant of L. In particular, we denote ML(I)0 by ML(I)
and call it the covering Milnor invariant of L.
It is easy to see that ML(I)p is
an ambient isotopy invariant for each p and ML(I) is the strongest invariant of
them. But it is not clear whether each ML(I)p is a cobordism invariant. Here, two
n-component links L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn and L′ = K ′
n in S3
are cobordant if there is a disjoint union of annuli A1, A2, · · · , An in S3 × [0, 1] such
that the boundary ∂Ai = Ki ∪ (−K ′
i is the ith
component K ′
i with the opposite orientation. It is known that Milnor invariants of
links are cobordism invariants [3]. The same result holds for the ﬁrst non-vanishing
covering Milnor invariants as follows.

Theorem 3.1. Let L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn+1 be an oriented (n + 1)-component
link in S3 with Kn+1 is trivial and linking numbers of Kn+1 and Ki are even
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. For a sequence I, if ∆L(0ε2···εn)(I)0 = {0} for all εi (i ∈
{2, . . . , n}, εi ∈ {0, 1}), then ML(I) is a cobordism invariant of L. That is, the ﬁrst
non-vanishing covering Milnor invariants are cobordism invariants.

Let us ﬁrst prove the following.

Lemma 3.2. Let W be a connected 4-manifold with the ﬁrst and second betti num-
bers are zero. There is a prime number p such that the ﬁrst and second homology
groups H1(W ; Zp), H2(W ; Zp) of W with Zp coeﬃcients are trivial. Moreover, for
any prime number p′ with p′ > p, H1(W ; Zp′ ) ∼= H2(W ; Zp′ ) ∼= {0}.

Proof. Since the ﬁrst and second betti numbers are zero by the hypothesis, there
is a prime number p such that

H1(W ; Z) ⊗ Zp ∼= H2(W ; Z) ⊗ Zp ∼= {0}.

Note that this is also true for any prime number which is greater than p.

Since W is connected, H0(W ; Z) ∼= Z. By the universal coeﬃcient theorem for

homology, we have the following two short exact sequences:

{0} −→ H1(W ; Z) ⊗ Zp −→ H1(W ; Zp) −→ T or(Z, Zp) −→ {0},
{0} −→ H2(W ; Z) ⊗ Zp −→ H2(W ; Zp) −→ T or(H1(W ; Z), Zp) −→ {0},

where T or(G1, G2) is the torsion product of abelian groups G1 and G2. Now we
have T or(Z, Zp) ∼= T or(H1(W ; Z), Zp) ∼= {0}. This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn+1 (resp. L′ = K ′
2 · · · ∪
K ′
n+1) is
trivial and linking numbers of Kn+1 and Ki (resp. K ′
i) are even for
i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Suppose that L and L′ are cobordant, i.e., there is a disjoint union
of annuli A1, A2, . . . , An+1 in S3 × [0, 1] such that each boundary ∂Ai = Ki ∪ (−K ′
i)
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1.

n+1 and K ′

Let W be the double branched cover of S3 × [0, 1] branched over An+1. Fix
ε2, . . . , εn, we may assume that the covering links L(0ε2 · · · εn) and L′(0ε2 · · · εn)

bound a disjoint union eA of annuli in W that are components of the preimage of
A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An. We note that ∂W = Σ(Kn+1) ∪ (−Σ(K ′
n+1)) = S3 ∪ (−S3).
We may assume that Kn+1 is in the boundary of the 4-ball B4 and bounds a
properly embedded 2-disk in B4 which is obtained from a disk in ∂B4 bounded by
Kn+1 by pushing it into B4. Let Σ be the double branched cover of B4 branched

over the properly embedded disk. Let N ( eA) be a regular neighborhood of eA, and
D = Σ ∪ N ( eA). Let E be the closure of W \ N ( eA). Then we have D ∪ E = W ∪ Σ

and note that D ∩ E is homeomorphic to Σ(Kn+1) \ N (L(0ε2 . . . εn)). Applying
Lemma 4.2 in [4] to D ∪ E, we have that the ﬁrst and second homology groups
of D ∪ E with rational coeﬃcients are trivial. Hence, by the universal coeﬃcient
theorem for homology, we have the ﬁrst and second betti numbers of D ∪ E are
zero. Lemma 3.2 therefore implies that there is a prime number p such that H1(D ∪
E; Zp) ∼= H2(D ∪ E; Zp) ∼= {0}. By the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence, we have the
following:

· · · −→ H2(D ∩ E; Zp) −→ H2(D; Zp) ⊕ H2(E; Zp) −→ {0}
−→ H1(D ∩ E; Zp) −→ H1(D; Zp) ⊕ H1(E; Zp) −→ {0} −→ · · · .

Since D is homotopic to a point, we have that H1(D; Zp) ∼= H2(D; Zp) ∼= {0}.
Therefore the homomorphism H1(D∩E; Zp) → H1(E; Zp) is a bijection and the ho-
momorphism H2(D∩E; Zp) → H2(E; Zp) is a surjection. A theorem of Stallings [18,
5.1 Theorem] implies that the inclusion map D ∩ E → E induces the following iso-
morphism:

for any natural number q. Hence the inclusion map Σ(Kn+1)\L(0ε2 · · · εn) → W \ eA

induces the following isomorphism:

π1(Σ(Kn+1) \ L(0ε2 · · · εn))
(π1(Σ(Kn+1) \ L(0ε2 · · · εn)))p

Similarly the inclusion map Σ(K ′

It follows that we have

Since L(0ε2 · · · εn) and L′(0ε2 · · · εn) bound eA, both peripheral structures of them

are preserved by the isomorphism above. This implies that ML(I)p = ML′(I)p. We
note that the equation hold for any prime number which is greater than p. This
and the fact that µL(I)p is the modulo-p reduction of µL(I)0 (Remark 2.1 (1))
complete the proof.

4. Milnor invariants and covering Milnor invariants

From now on we denote µL(I)0 by µL(I) as usual. A link is Brunnian if any

proper sublink is trivial.

Theorem 4.1. Let L be an oriented ordered (n+1)-component Brunnian link in S3
(n ≥ 2). For a non-repeated sequence I = i1i2 · · · in+1 with ik = n + 1 (2 ≤ k ≤ n),

µL(I) ≡ X

µL(ε1ε2···εn)(I \ {n + 1}) mod 2,

(ε1,ε2,...,εn)∈E(I)
where E(I) = {(ε1, ε2, . . . , εn) ∈ Zn
subsequence of I obtained by deleting n + 1(= ik).

2 | εik−1 = εik+1 = 0} and I \ {n + 1} is a

Remark 4.2. There is a 3-component Brunnian link (see Figure 7.1) such that
µL(132) = −1 and µL(00)(12) = 1. Hence Theorem 4.1 does not hold without
taking modulo 2.

Remark 4.3. Since the image of L(ε1ε2 · · · εn) \ K εi
is a trivial link that bounds
i
a disjoint union of disks in S3 \ Kn+1, L(ε1ε2 · · · εn) is also a Brunnian link in
Σ(Kn+1)(= S3). Hence we can repeatedly apply Theorem 4.1 to covering links.
Then we have that the length n + 1 Milnor invariants for L is modulo-2 congruent
to a sum of linking numbers of ‘iterated’ covering links.

5. Claspers

We use clasper theory introduced by K. Habiro [7] to prove Theorem 4.1. In this
section, we brieﬂy recall from [7] the basic notions of clasper theory. In this paper,
we essentially only need the notion of Ck-tree. For a general deﬁnition of claspers,
we refer the reader to [7]. Let L be a link in S3.

Deﬁnition 5.1. An embedded disk T in S3 is called a tree clasper for L if it sat-
isﬁes the following (1), (2) and (3):
(1) T is decomposed into disks and bands, called edges, each of which connects two
distinct disks.
(2) The disks have either 1 or 3 incident edges, called disk-leaves or nodes respec-
tively.
(3) L intersects T transversely and the intersections are contained in the union of
the interior of the disk-leaves.
The degree of a tree clasper is the number of the disk-leaves minus 1. (In [7], a tree
clasper is called a strict tree clasper.) A degree k tree clasper is called a Ck-tree. A
Ck-tree is simple if each disk-leaf intersects L at one point.

We will make use of the drawing convention for claspers of Fig. 4 in [7]. Given
a Ck-tree T for L, there is a procedure to construct a framed link γ(T ) in a regular
neighborhood of T . Surgery along T means surgery along γ(T ). Since surgery along
γ(T ) preserves the ambient space, surgery along the Ck-tree T can be regarded as a
local move on L in S3. We will denote by LT the link in S3 which is obtained from L
by surgery along T . Similarly, for a disjoint union of tree claspers T1 ∪ T2 ∪ · · · ∪ Tm,
we can deﬁne LT1∪T2∪···∪Tm. A Ck-tree T having the shape of tree clasper like
Figure 5.1 is called a linear Ck-tree, and the leftmost and rightmost disk-leaves of
T are called the ends of T . In particular, surgery along a simple linear Ck-tree for
L is ambient isotopic to a band summing of L and the (k + 1)-component Milnor
link (Fig. 7 in [12]), see Figure 5.1.

Deﬁnition 5.2. A simple Ck-tree T for L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn is a C d
k -tree if
|{ i |Ki ∩ T 6= ∅, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}| = k + 1. Let T be a linear C d
k -tree with the ends
f0 and fk. Since T is a disk, we can travel from f0 to fk along the boundary of

T so that we meet all other disk-leaves f1, . . . , fk−1 in this order. If fs intersects
the isth component of L (s = 0, . . . , k), we can consider two vectors (i0, . . . , ik)
and (ik, . . . , i0), and may assume that (i0, . . . , ik) ≤ (ik, . . . , i0), where ‘≤’ is the
lexicographic order in Zk+1. We call (i0, . . . , ik) the o-index of T .

The following theorem is essentially shown by Milnor [12].

Theorem 5.3. [12, Section 5] Let O = O1 ∪ O2 ∪ · · · ∪ On+1 be an oriented (n +
1)-component trivial link in S3, and T a linear C d
n-tree for O with the o-index
(i1, i2, . . . , in+1). Then all Milnor invariants of OT with the length ≤ n vanish and

6. Proof of Theorem 4.1

Let L = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn+1 be an oriented (n + 1)-component Brunnian link
in S3. Since for a non-repeated sequence I = i1i2 · · · in+1 in Theorem 4.1, the
essential condition is that n + 1 is neither i1 nor in+1, we may assume that i1 = 1
and in+1 = 2 to avoid complicated arguments in this section.

Let Σ(Kn+1) be the double branched cover of S3 branched over Kn+1.

It is
shown in [14], [8] that there is a disjoint union of linear C d
n-trees T1 ∪ T2 ∪ · · · ∪ Tm
for an (n + 1)-component trivial link O = O1 ∪ O2 ∪ · · · ∪ On+1 such that L and
OT1∪T2∪···∪Tm are ambient isotopic. Consider induction on the length of the path
connecting two disk-leaves of each Tr grasping O1 and O2, Lemma 5.4 implies the
following.

link O = O1 ∪ O2 ∪ · · · ∪ On+1 such that L and OT1∪T2∪···∪Tm are ambient isotopic
and that the ends of Tr grasp O1 and O2 for each r(= 1, 2, . . . , m).

We identify Kn+1 and On+1. In the following, we will observe that the preimage
of K1 ∪ K2 ∪ · · · ∪ Kn is obtained from the preimage of O1 ∪ O2 ∪ · · · ∪ On by
surgery along claspers. There is a disjoint union of 3-balls B1 ∪ B2 ∪ · · · ∪ Bm in
S3 such that Br ∩ (T1 ∪ T2 ∪ · · · ∪ Tm) = Tr and Br ∩ O is a trivial tangle. Let
α = Br ∩ On+1, see Figure 6.1 (a). We consider the double branched cover of Br
branched over α. By using move 9 in [7], we decompose Tr into two tree claspers
Tr1 and Tr2 (see Figure 6.1 (b)), where Trj intersects Oj (j = 1, 2). Recall that
the ends of Tr grasp O1 and O2. Set Oδs
j ) be a preimage of Ojs (resp.
Oj) for s = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2, δs(= εjs) ∈ Z2 (resp. for j = 1, 2, εj ∈ Z2). By using
genus-1 surface F as illustrated in Figure 6.1 (b), we have a surgery description of
the double branched cover as illustrated in Figure 6.2 [1]. Let T ε
r2) be
a preimage of Tr1 with T ε
jl+1 6= ∅) for ε ∈ {0, 1}. Then
we have a new clasper Gr with two boxes, see Figure 6.3. Here a box, given in [7],
is a disk with 3 incident edges which is obtained by replacing a disjoint union of 3
disk-leaves as illustrated in Figure 6.4.

Proof of Theorem 4.1. It is shown in [5] that the length-l Milnor invariants are
additive under the band sum operation if all Milnor invariants with the length
≤ l − 1 vanish. The boundary ∂Br of the regular neighborhood Br of Tr can be
assumed to be a decomposing sphere for a band sum operation between OTr and
O(T1∪T2∪···∪Tm)\Tr . Hence we may assume that L is a band sum of m + 1 links
OT1 , OT2 , . . . , OTm and O. Since OTr is an (n + 1)-component Brunnian link for
each r(= 1, 2, . . . , m), all Milnor invariants with the length ≤ n vanish. Therefore
we have that

µL(I) =

7. Link-homotopy

Link-homotopy is an equivalence relation generated by crossing changes on the
same component of links. It is shown in [12] that Milnor invariants for non-repeated
sequences are link-homotopy invariants of links. However for covering Milnor in-
variants the same result does not hold.

Example 7.1. Let O = O1 ∪ O2 ∪ O3 be an oriented 3-component trivial link in S3.
Let L be a link which is obtained from O by surgery along a linear C d
2 -tree T1 as
illustrated in Figure 7.1 (a), and L′ a link which is obtained from O by surgery along
a disjoint union of T1 and a simple linear C3-tree T2 as illustrated in Figure 7.2 (a).
It is not hard to see that L and L′ are link-homotopic.

Since the both L and L′ are Brunnian links, we have the double branched cover
of S3 branched over O3 which is a component of L (resp. L′). Moreover we
have surgery descriptions as illustrated in Figure 7.1 (b) and Figure 7.2 (b). Then

covering links L(00) and L(01) of L are links as illustrated in Figure 7.3, and hence
we have µL(00)(12) = 1, µL(01)(12) = −1. We conclude that ML(12) = {1, −1}.
On the other hand, covering links L′(00) and L′(01) of L′ are links as illustrated
in Figure 7.4. Since µL′(00)(12) = 3, µL′(01)(12) = −3, we have that ML′(12) =
{3, −3}. Therefore L and L′ are link-homotopic, and ML(12) 6= ML′(12).

Figure 7.4. Covering links of L′

Remark 7.2. Since L and L′ are Brunnian links and they are link-homotopic,
µL(I) = µL′(I) for any sequence I with the length at most 3. We note that L is the
Borromean rings. Hence |µL(123)| = |µL(132)| = 1. It follows that for any sequence
I with the length at least 4, ∆L(I)0 = ∆L′ (I)0 = Z if each i ∈ {1, 2, 3} appears in
I, or µL(I) = µL′(I) = 0 otherwise. In both cases, we have µL(I) = µL′(I) = 0.
This implies that L and L′ have the same ordinary Milnor invariants, and diﬀerent
covering Milnor invariants.
