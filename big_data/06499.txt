SYMMETRIES OF SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL

EQUATIONS ON LIE ALGEBROIDS

LIVIU POPESCU

Abstract. In this paper we investigate the relations between semispray, non-
linear connection, dynamical covariant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism on
Lie algebroids. Using these geometric structures, we study the symmetries of
second order diﬀerential equations in the general framework of Lie algebroids.

Keywords: Lie algebroids, symmetries, semispray, nonlinear connection, dyna-

mical covariant derivative, Jacobi endomorphism.

1. Introduction

The geometry of second order diﬀerential equations (SODE) on the tangent bun-
dle T M of a diﬀerentiable manifold M is closely related to the geometry of nonlinear
connections [8, 15]. The system of SODE can by represented using the notion of
semispray, which together with the nonlinear connection induce two important con-
cepts: the dynamical covariant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism [4, 5, 9, 16, 25,
36]. The notion of symmetry in ﬁelds theory using various geometric framework
are intense studied (see for instance [1, 3, 5, 12, 18, 20, 35]). The notion of Lie alge-
broid is a natural generalization of the tangent bundle. In the last decades the Lie
algebroids [23, 24] are the objects of intensive studies with applications to mechan-
ical systems or optimal control ([2, 7, 10, 19, 22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38])
and are the natural framework in which one can develope the theory of diﬀerential
equations, where the notion of symmetry plays a very important role.

In this paper we study some properties of semispray and generalize the notion of
symmetry for second order diﬀerential equations on Lie algebroids and characterize
its properties using the dynamical covariant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism.
The paper is organized as follows. In the section two the preliminary geometric
structures on Lie algebroids are introduced and some relations between them are
given. We present the Jacobi endomorphism on Lie algebroids and ﬁnd the relation
with the curvature tensor of Ehresmann nonlinear connection. In the section three
we study the dynamical covariant derivative on Lie algebroids. Using a semispray
and an arbitrary nonlinear connection, we introduce the dynamical covariant de-
rivative on Lie algebroids as a tensor derivation and prove that the compatibility
condition with the tangent structure ﬁx the canonical nonlinear connection. In the
case of the canonical nonlinear connection induced by a semispray, more properties
of dynamical covariant derivative are added. In the case of homogeneous second
order diﬀerential equations (spray) the relation between the dynamical covariant
derivative and Berwald connection is given. In the last section we study the dy-
namical symmetry, Lie symmetry, Newtonoid section and Cartan symmetry on Lie
algebroids and ﬁnd the relations between them. Moreover, we characterize their

properties in terms of dynamical covariant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism,
which generalize some results from [5]. We have to mention that the Noether’s
theorem for Lagrangian systems on Lie algebroids can be found in [6]. Also, using
the k-symplectic formalism on Lie algebroids developed in [21] one can study the
symmetries in this new framework, which generalize the results from [3].

2. Lie algebroids

Let M be a real, C∞-diﬀerentiable, n-dimensional manifold and (T M, πM , M )
its tangent bundle. A Lie algebroid over a manifold M is a triple (E, [·, ·]E, σ),
where (E, π, M ) is a vector bundle of rank m over M, which satisﬁes the following
conditions:
a) C∞(M )-module of sections Γ(E) is equipped with a Lie algebra structure [·, ·]E.
b) σ : E → T M is a bundle map (called the anchor) which induces a Lie algebra
homomorphism (also denoted σ) from the Lie algebra of sections (Γ(E), [·, ·]E) to
the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds (χ(M ), [·, ·]) satisfying the Leibniz rule

(1)

[s1, f s2]E = f [s1, s2]E + (σ(s1)f )s2, ∀s1, s2 ∈ Γ(E), f ∈ C∞(M ).

From the above deﬁnition it results:

1◦ [·, ·]E is a R-bilinear operation,
2◦ [·, ·]E is skew-symmetric, i.e. [s1, s2]E = −[s2, s1]E,
3◦ [·, ·]E veriﬁes the Jacobi identity

∀s1, s2 ∈ Γ(E),

[s1, [s2, s3]E]E + [s2, [s3, s1]E]E + [s3, [s1, s2]E]E = 0,

and σ being a Lie algebra homomorphism, means that σ[s1, s2]E = [σ(s1), σ(s2)].
The existence of a Lie bracket on the space of sections of a Lie algebroid leads
to a calculus on its sections analogous to the usual Cartan calculus on diﬀerential
forms.

If f is a function on M , then df (x) ∈ E∗

x is given by hdf (x), ai = σ(a)f , for

∀a ∈ Ex. For ω ∈Vk(E∗) the exterior derivative dEω ∈Vk+1(E∗) is given by the

formula

dEω(s1, ..., sk+1) =

k+1Xi=1

(−1)i+1σ(si)ω(s1, ...,

ˆ
si, ..., sk+1) +

+ X1≤i<j≤k+1

(−1)i+jω([si,sj]E, s1, ...,

ˆ
si, ...,

ˆ
sj, ...sk+1).

where si ∈ Γ(E), i = 1, k + 1, and the hat over an argument means the absence of
the argument. It results that

(dE)2 = 0,

dE(ω1 ∧ ω2) = dEω1 ∧ ω2 + (−1)deg ω1ω1 ∧ dEω2,

The cohomology associated with dE is called the Lie algebroid cohomology of E.
Also, for ξ ∈ Γ(E) one can deﬁne the Lie derivative with respect to ξ by Lξ =
iξ ◦ dE + dE ◦ iξ, where iξ is the contraction with ξ.

We recall that if L and K are (1, 1)-type tensor ﬁeld, Fr¨olisher-Nijenhuis bracket

[L, K] is the vector valued 2-form [11]

[L, K]E(X, Y ) = [LX, KY ]E + [KX, LY ]E + (LK + KL)[X, Y ]E −

−L[X, KY ]E − K[X, LY ]E − L[KX, Y ]E − K[LX, Y ]E.

SYMMETRIES OF SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ON LIE ALGEBROIDS 3

and the Nijenhuis tensor of L is given by

NL(X, Y ) =

1
2

[L, L]E = [LX, LY ]E + L2[X, Y ]E − L[X, LY ]E − L[LX, Y ]E.

For a vector ﬁeld in X (E) and a (1, 1)-type tensor ﬁeld L on E the Fr¨olisher-
Nijenhuis bracket [X, L]E = LX L is the (1, 1)-type tensor ﬁeld on E given by

where LX is the usual Lie derivative.

LX L = LX ◦ L − L ◦ LX ,

If we take the local coordinates (xi) on an open U ⊂ M , a local basis {sα} of
the sections of the bundle π−1(U ) → U generates local coordinates (xi, yα) on E.

2.1. The prolongation of a Lie algebroid over the vector bundle projec-
tion. Let (E, π, M ) be a vector bundle. For the projection π : E → M we can
construct the prolongation of E (see [17, 19, 26]). The associated vector bundle is
(T E, π2, E) where

T E = ∪

TwE,

TwE = {(ux, vw) ∈ Ex×TwE | σ(ux) = Twπ(vw),

π(w) = x ∈ M },

w∈E

and the projection π2(ux, vw) = πE(vw) = w, where πE : T E → E is the tangent
projection. We also have the canonical projection π1 : T E → E given by π1(u, v) =
u. The projection onto the second factor σ1 : T E → T E, σ1(u, v) = v will be the
anchor of a new Lie algebroid over the manifold E. An element of T E is said to be
vertical if it is in the kernel of the projection π1. We will denote (V T E, π2|V T E , E)
the vertical bundle of (T E, π2, E) and σ1 |V T E : V T E → V T E is an isomorphism.
If f ∈ C∞(M ) we will denote by f c and f v the complete and vertical lift to E of f
deﬁned by

f c(u) = σ(u)(f ),

f v(u) = f (π(u)),

u ∈ E.

For s ∈ Γ(E) we can consider the vertical lift of s given by sv(u) = s(π(u))v
u, for
u ∈ E, where v
u : Eπ(u) → Tu(Eπ(u)) is the canonical isomorphism. There exists a
unique vector ﬁeld sc on E, the complete lift of s satisfying the following conditions:

i) sc is π-projectable on σ(s),
ii) sc(

∧

α) = dLsα,

for all α ∈ Γ(E∗), where

Considering the prolongation T E of E ([26]), we may introduce the vertical lift sv
and the complete lift sc of a section s ∈ Γ(E) as the sections of T E → E given by

sv(u) = (0, sv(u)),

sc(u) = (s(π(u)), sc(u)),

u ∈ E.

Other two canonical objects on T E are the Euler section C and the tangent struc-
ture (vertical endomorphism) J. The Euler section C is the section of T E → E
deﬁned by C(u) = (0, uv
u), ∀u ∈ E. The vertical endomorphism is the section of
(T E) ⊕ (T E)∗ → E characterized by J(sv) = 0, J(sc) = sv, s ∈ Γ(E) which
satisﬁes

J 2 = 0, ImJ = ker J = V T E,

[C, J]T E = −J.

A section S of T E → E is called semispray (second order diﬀerential equation
-SODE ) on E if J(S) = C. The local basis of Γ(T E) is given by {Xα, Vα}, where
[26]

and (∂/∂xi, ∂/∂yα) is the local basis on T E. The structure functions of T E are
given by the following formulas

The vertical lift of a section ρ = ραsα is ρv = ραVα. The coordinate expression of
Euler section is C = yαVα and the local expression of J is given by J = X α ⊗ Vα,
where {X α, V α} denotes the corresponding dual basis of {Xα, Vα}. The Nijenhuis
tensor of the vertical endomorphism vanishes and it results that J is integrable.

Deﬁnition 1. A nonlinear connection on T E is an almost product structure N on
π2 : T E → E (i.e. a bundle morphism N : T E → T E, such that N 2 = Id) smooth
on T E\{0} such that V T E = ker(Id + N ).

If N is a connection on T E then HT E = ker(Id−N ) is the horizontal subbundle
associated to N and T E = V T E ⊕ HT E. Each ρ ∈ Γ(T E) can be written as
ρ = ρh + ρv, where ρh, ρv are sections in the horizontal and respective vertical
If ρh = 0, then ρ is called vertical and if ρv = 0, then ρ is called
subbundles.
horizontal. A connection N on T E induces two projectors h, v : T E → T E such
that h(ρ) = ρh and v(ρ) = ρv for every ρ ∈ Γ(T E). We have

h =

Deﬁnition 2. The curvature of the nonlinear connection N on T E is Ω = −Nh

where Rγ

the integrability of HT E, understanding that a vanishing curvature entails that
horizontal sections are closed under the Lie algebroid bracket of T E. The horizontal
distribution HT E is integrable if and only if the curvature Ω of the nonlinear
connection vanishes. Also, from the Jacobi identity we obtain

[h, Ω]T E = 0.

Let us consider a semispray S and an arbitrary nonlinear connection N with

induced (h, v) projectors. Then we set (see also [33])

3. Dynamical covariant derivative on Lie algebroids

In following we will introduce the notion of dynamical covariant derivative on

Lie algebroids as a tensor derivation and study its properties.

Deﬁnition 4. [33] A map ∇ : T(T E\{0}) → T(T E\{0}) is said to be a tensor
derivation on T E\{0} if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
i) ∇ is R-linear
ii) ∇ is type preserving, i.e. ∇(Tr
s(T E\{0}), for each (r, s) ∈ N×N.
iii) ∇ obeys the Leibnitz rule ∇(P ⊗ S) = ∇P ⊗ S + P ⊗ ∇S, for any tensors P, S
on T E\{0}.
iv) ∇ commutes with any contractions, where T•
on T E\{0}.

•(T E\{0}) is the space of tensors

s(T E\{0}) ⊂ Tr

For a semispray S and an arbitrary nonlinear connection N we consider the

R-linear map ∇ : Γ(T E\{0}) → Γ(T E\{0}) given by

(16)

∇ = h ◦ LS ◦ h + v ◦ LS ◦ v,

which will be called the dynamical covariant derivative induced by the semispray
S and the nonlinear connection N . By setting ∇f = S(f ), for f ∈ C∞(T E\{0})
using the Leibnitz rule and the requirement that ∇ commutes with any contraction,
we can extend the action of ∇ to arbitrary section on T E\{0}. For a section on
T E\{0} the dynamical covariant derivative is given by (∇ϕ)(ρ) = S(ϕ)(ρ)−ϕ(∇ρ).
For a (1, 1)-type tensor ﬁeld T on T E\{0} the dynamical covariant derivative has
the form

(17)

∇T = ∇ ◦ T − T ◦ ∇.

and by direct computation using (17) we obtain

∇h = ∇v = 0.

Also, we get

Proof. From (8) we get

J[S, JX]T E = −JX ⇒ J ([S, JX]T E + X) = 0 ⇒ [S, JX]T E + X ∈ V T E

h ([S, JX]T E + X) = 0 ⇒ h[S, JX]T E = −hX ⇔ h ◦ LS ◦ J = −h.

Also, in J[S, JX]T E + JX = 0 considering JX = vZ it results J[S, vZ]T E =
−vZ ⇔ J ◦ LS ◦ v = −v. Next

∇ ◦ J = h ◦ LS ◦ h ◦ J + v ◦ LS ◦ v ◦ J = v ◦ LS ◦ J =

= (Id − h) ◦ LS ◦ J = LS ◦ J − h ◦ LS ◦ J = LS ◦ J + h.

But, on the other hand

J ◦ ∇ = J ◦ LS ◦ h = J ◦ LS ◦ (Id − v) = J ◦ LS − J ◦ LS ◦ v = J ◦ LS + v.

and we obtain

∇ ◦ J − J ◦ ∇ = LS ◦ J + h − J ◦ LS − v ⇒ ∇J = LSJ + h − v = LSJ + N .

Proof. The proof follows from the relations (20).
This theorem shows that the compatibility condition ∇J = 0 of the dynamical
covariant derivative with the tangent structure determines the nonlinear connection
N = −LSJ. For the particular case of tangent bundle we obtain the results from
[5]. In the following we deal with this nonlinear connection induced by semispray.

We have to show that F2 = −Id. Indeed, from the relation LS h = LS ◦ h − h ◦ LS
we obtain F = h ◦ LS ◦ h − h ◦ LS − J = h ◦ LS ◦ (h − Id) − J = −h ◦ LS ◦ v − J and
F2 = (−h ◦ LS ◦ v − J) ◦ (−h ◦ LS ◦ v − J) = h ◦ LS ◦ v ◦ h ◦ LS ◦ v + h ◦ LS ◦ v ◦ J+
+J ◦ h ◦ LS ◦ v + J 2 = h ◦ LS ◦ J + J ◦ LS ◦ v = −h − v = −Id.

Proposition 4. The following results hold

F ◦ J = h,

J ◦ F = v,

v ◦ F = F ◦ h = −J,

h ◦ F = F ◦ v = F + J, N ◦ F = F + 2J, Φ = LSh − F − J.

Proof. Using the relations (19) we obtain
F ◦ J = (−h ◦ LS ◦ v − J) ◦ J = −h ◦ LS ◦ v ◦ J − J 2 = −h ◦ LS ◦ J = h,
J ◦ F = −J ◦ (h ◦ LS ◦ v + J) = −J ◦ h ◦ LS ◦ v − J 2 = −J ◦ LS ◦ v = v,
v◦ F = v◦(h ◦ LS h − J) = −v◦J = −J, F◦h = (−h ◦ LS ◦ v − J)◦h = −J ◦h =
−J, h ◦ F = h ◦ (h ◦ LSh − J) = h ◦ LS h = F + J, F ◦ v = (−h ◦ LS ◦ v − J) ◦ v =
⊓⊔
−h ◦ LS ◦ v = F + J. In the same way, the other relations can be proved.

In local coordinates we have

F = −Vα ⊗ X α + δα ⊗ δV α.

For a semispray S and the associated nonlinear connection we consider the R-

linear map ∇0 : Γ(T E\{0}) → Γ(T E\{0}) given by

∇0ρ = h[S, hρ]T E + v[S, vρ]T E,

∀ρ ∈ Γ(T E\{0}).

It results that

∇0(f ρ) = S(f )ρ + f ∇0ρ,

∀f ∈ C∞(E), ρ ∈ Γ(T E\{0})

Any tensor derivation on T E\{0} is completely determined by its actions on smooth
functions and sections on T E\{0} (see [37] generalized Willmore’s theorem). There-
fore, there exists a unique tensor derivation ∇ on T E\{0} such that

∇ |C∞(E)= S, ∇ |Γ(T E\{0})= ∇0.

We will call the tensor derivation ∇, the dynamical covariant derivative induced by
the semispray S (see [4] for the tangent bundle case). In this case the dynamical
covariant derivative is characterized by the following formulas

∇Vβ = v[S, Vβ]T E =(cid:0)N α
∇δβ = h[S, δβ]T E =(cid:0)N α

Proposition 5. The dynamical covariant derivative has the following decomposi-
tion

Proof. Using the formula (16) and the expressions of F and Φ we obtain

∇ = h ◦ LS ◦ h + v ◦ LS ◦ v =

= h ◦ (LSh + h ◦ LS ) + v ◦ (LS v + v ◦ LS ) =
= h ◦ LSh + v ◦ LSv + (h + v) ◦ LS = LS + h ◦ LSh + v ◦ LSv =
= LS + F + J − Φ.

Proposition 6. The dynamical covariant derivative induced by the semispray S is
compatible with J and F, that is

∇J = 0, ∇F = 0.

Proof. ∇J = 0 follows from (20). Using the formula F = −h ◦ LS ◦ v − J and

∇F = ∇ ◦ F − F ◦ ∇ we obtain

∇F = (h ◦ LS ◦ h + v ◦ LS ◦ v) ◦ (−h ◦ LS ◦ v) − (−h ◦ LS ◦ v) ◦ (h ◦ LS ◦ h + v ◦ LS ◦ v) =

= −h ◦ LS ◦ h ◦ LS ◦ v + h ◦ LS ◦ v ◦ LS ◦ v =
= h ◦ LS ◦ (v − h) ◦ LS ◦ v = h ◦ LS ◦ LSJ ◦ LS ◦ v =
= h ◦ LS ◦ (LS ◦ J − J ◦ LS) ◦ LS ◦ v =
= h ◦ LS ◦ LS ◦ (J ◦ LS ◦ v) − (h ◦ LS ◦ J) ◦ LS ◦ LS ◦ v =
= −h ◦ LS ◦ LS ◦ v + h ◦ LS ◦ LS ◦ v = 0.

⊓⊔

Proposition 7. If the dynamical covariant derivative is induced by a spray S then

∇S = 0, ∇C = 0.

Proof. Indeed, if S is a spray the we have S = hS and vS = 0 and it results
∇S = h ◦ LS ◦ hS + v ◦ LS ◦ vS = h ◦ LS ◦ S = 0. Also ∇C = 0 follows from hC = 0,
vC = C and [C, S]T E = S.
⊓⊔
Other geometric structure induced by a nonlinear connection is the Berwald

connection

D : Γ(T E\{0}) × Γ(T E\{0}) → Γ(T E\{0})

DX Y = v[hX, vY ]T E + h[vX, hY ]T E + J[vX, (F + J)Y ]T E + (F + J)[hX, JY ]T E.

Proposition 8. The Berwald connection has the following properties

Dh = 0, Dv = 0, DJ = 0, DF = 0

Proof. Using the properties of the vertical and horizontal projectors we obtain
DX vY = v[hX, vY ]T E + J[vX, (F + J)Y ]T E and
v(DX Y ) = v[hX, vY ]T E + J[vX, (F + J)Y ]T E which yields Dv = 0. Also,
DX hY = h[vX, hY ]T E + (F + J)[hX, JY ]T E = h(DX Y ) and it results Dh = 0.

Moreover,

DX JY = v[hX, JY ]T E+J[vX, hY ]T E and J(DX Y ) = J[vX, hY ]T E+v[hX, JY ]T E

and we obtain DJ = 0. From

DX FY = v[hX, −JY ]T E+h[vX, (F+J)Y ]T E+J[vX, −hY ]T E+(F+J)[hX, vY ]T E

and

F(DX Y ) = (F+J)[hX, vY ]T E−J[vX, hY ]T E+h[vX, (F+J)Y ]T E−v[hX, JY ]T E =
DX FY we get DF = 0.

Proposition 9. If S is a spray then the following equality hold

∇ = DS.

Proof. If S is a spray then S = hS and vS = 0 which implies

DS Y = v[S, vY ]T E + (F + J)[S, JY ]T E.

But ∇Y = h[S, hY ]T E + v[S, vY ]T E and we will prove that h[S, hY ]T E = (F +

sections denoted XS is given by

XS = Ker(J ◦ LS) = Im(Id + J ◦ LS).

In the following we will use the dynamical covariant derivative in order to char-
acterize the newtonoid section on Lie algebroids. Let S a semispray, N an arbitrary
nonlinear connection and ∇ the induced dynamical covariant derivative. We set:

Proposition 12. A section X ∈ Γ(T E\{0}) is a dynamical symmetry if and only
if X is a newtonoid and

(27)

∇(J∇X) + Φ(X) = 0.

Proof. If X is a dynamical symmetry then h[S, X]T E = v[S, X]T E = 0 and
composing by J we get J[S, X]T E = 0 that means X is a newtonoid. Therefore,
v[S, X]T E = v[S, vX]T E + v[S, hX]T E = ∇(vX) + Φ(X) and using (26) we get
∇(J∇X) + Φ(X) = 0.
⊓⊔

Deﬁnition 9. A section X ∈ Γ(T E\{0}) is called a Cartan symmetry of the
Lagrangian L, if LX ωL = 0 and LX EL = 0.

Proposition 13. Consider L a regular Lagrangian on T E and X ∈ Γ(T E\{0}) a
Cartan symmetry of L. Then X is a Newtonoid section for the semispray induced
by L.

Proof. From the symplectic equation iSωL = −dEEL, appling the Lie derivative

in the both sides, we obtain

LX iSωL = −LX dEEL = −dELX EL = 0.

Also, using the formula i[X,Y ]T E = LX ◦ iY − iY ◦ LX it results

LX iSωL = −i[S,X]T E ωL + iSLX ωL = −i[S,X]T E ωL

which yields

i[S,X]T E ωL = 0.

For X = X α(x, y)Xα + Y α(x, y)Vα we have

For f ∈ C∞(T E) and X ∈ Γ(T E\{0}) we deﬁne the product

f ∗ X = (Id + J ◦ LS)(f X) = f X + f J[S, X]T E + S(f )JX,

and remark that a section X ∈ Γ(T E\{0}) is a newtonoid if and only if

If X ∈ XS then

X = X α(x, y) ∗ Xα.

f ∗ X = f X + S(f )JX.

Proposition 14. Let us consider a semispray S, an arbitrary nonlinear connec-
tion N and ∇ the dynamical covariant derivative. The following conditions are
equivalent:

i) ∇ restricts to ∇ : XS → XS satisﬁes the Leibniz rule with respect to the ∗

product.

iii) LSJ + N = 0,
iv) N β

Proof. For ii) ⇒ i) we consider X ∈ XS and using (26) we have vX = J(∇X)
which leads to ∇(vX) = ∇(J∇X).
It results (∇v)X + v(∇X) = (∇J)(∇X) +
J∇(∇X) and using the relations ∇v = 0 and ∇J = 0 we obtain v(∇X) = J∇(∇X)
which implies ∇X ∈ XS . For X ∈ XS we have

∇ (f ∗ X) = ∇(f X + S(f )JX) = S(f )X + f ∇X + S2(f )JX + S(f )∇(JX),

∇f ∗ X + f ∗ ∇X = S(f )X + S2(f )JX + f ∇X + S(f )J(∇X).

But ∇(JX) = (∇J)X + J(∇X) and from ∇J = 0 we obtain ∇(JX) = J(∇X)
which leads to ∇ (f ∗ X) = ∇f ∗ X + f ∗ ∇X.

For i) ⇒ ii) we consider the set XS ∪ Γv(T E\{0}) which is a set of generators
for Γ(T E\{0}). We have ∇J(X) = 0 for X ∈ Γv(T E\{0}) and for X ∈ XS using
∇ (f ∗ X) = ∇f ∗ X + f ∗ ∇X it results S(f )∇(JX) = S(f )J(∇X), which implies
S(f )(∇J)X = 0, for an arbitrary function f ∈ C∞(T E\{0}). Therefore, ∇J = 0
on XS which ends the proof. The equivalence of the conditions ii), iii), iv) have

been proved in the theorem 3.2
Next we consider de dynamical covariant derivative ∇ induced by the semispray

Conclussions. The main purpose of this paper is to study the symmetries of
SODE on Lie algebroids and relations between them, using the dynamical covari-
ant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism. The existence of a semispray S together
with an arbitrary nonlinear connection N deﬁne a dynamical covariant derivative
and the Jacobi endomorphism.
In the case of homogeneous SODE (spray), the
Jacobi endomorphism is the contraction with S of the curvature of the nonlinear
connection. Let us remark that at this point we do not have any relation between
S and the nonlinear connection N . This will be given considering the compatibility
condition between the dynamical covariant derivative and the tangent structure,
∇J = 0, which ﬁx the canonical nonlinear connection N = −LSJ. This canonical
nonlinear connection depends only on semispray. In this case we have the decom-
position ∇ = LS + F + J − Φ which can be compared with the tangent case from
[5, 25]. Also, in the case of spray, the dynamical covariant derivative coincides with
Berwald connection. We study the dynamical symmetry, Lie symmetry, Newtonoid
section and Cartan symmetry on Lie algebroids and characterize their properties
with the help of dynamical covariant derivative and Jacobi endomorphism. As fur-
ther developments one can study the symmetries using the k-symplectic formalism
on Lie algebroids given in [21].
