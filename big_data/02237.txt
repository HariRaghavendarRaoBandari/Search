Abstract. Let α = {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G) be a partial action of a groupoid G on a
non-associative ring R and let S = R ⋆α G be the associated partial skew groupoid ring.
We show that if α is global and unital, then S is left (right) artinian if and only if R is left
(right) artinian and Rg = {0}, for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G). We use this result
to prove that if α is unital and R is alternative, then S is left (right) artinian if and only
if R is left (right) artinian and Rg = {0}, for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G). Both of
these results apply to partial skew group rings, and in particular they generalize a result
by J. K. Park for classical skew group rings, i.e. the case when R is unital and associative,
and G is a group which acts globally on R. Moreover, we provide two applications of
our main result. First, we generalize I. G. Connell’s classical result for group rings by
giving a characterization of artinian (non-associative) groupoid rings. This result is in
turn applied to partial group algebras. Finally, we give a characterization of artinian
Leavitt path algebras.

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

1. Introduction

In 1963, Connell [7] showed that if R is a unital and associative ring, and G is a group,
then the group ring R[G] is left (right) artinian if and only if R is left (right) artinian and
G is ﬁnite. Later on, Passman gave examples of artinian twisted group rings by inﬁnite
groups (see [33, Section 4]). Passman’s examples show that Connell’s result can not be
generalized to twisted group rings or, more generally, crossed products.

Another type of crossed products, generalizing group rings, are the skew group rings.
Recall that if α : G ∋ g 7→ αg ∈ Aut(R) is a group homomorphism from G to Aut(R),
the group of ring automorphisms of R, then the skew group ring R ∗α G is the set of ﬁnite
formal sums of the form Pg∈G rgg with addition deﬁned componentwise and multiplication
deﬁned by the relations (rg)(sh) = (rαg(s))gh, for r, s ∈ R and g, h ∈ G. In 1979, Park
[32] generalized Connell’s result to skew group rings by showing the following.

Theorem 1.1 (Park [32]). If R is a unital and associative ring, and α is a group ho-
momorphism from a group G to Aut(R), then the skew group ring R ∗α G is left (right)
artinian if and only if R is left (right) artinian and G is ﬁnite.

In this article, we consider two generalizations (see Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3) of
Theorem 1.1 in the context of partial skew groupoid rings over non-associative rings, i.e.
rings which are not necessarily associative.

The notion of a partial action of a group on a C*-algebra was introduced by Exel [12],
as an eﬃcient tool to their study. Since then, the theory of (twisted) partial actions on
C*-algebras has played a key role in the characterization of several classes of C*-algebras
as crossed products by (twisted) partial actions, e.g. AF-algebras [14], Bunce-Deddens
algebras [13], Cuntz-Krieger algebras [15] and Cuntz-Li algebras [6], (see also the survey
[8]). In a purely algebraic context, partial skew group rings were introduced by Dokuchaev
and Exel [9] as a generalization of classical skew group rings and as an algebraic analogue
of partial crossed product C*-algebras.

Partial group actions can be described in terms of premorphisms, which is a notion
introduced by McAlister and Reilly [29]. As explained in [24], a partial action of a group
G on a set X is a unital premorphism from G to the inverse monoid I(X), consisting of
bijections between subsets of X. This perspective motivated to the study of partial actions
of other algebraic structures rather than groups on sets, such as semigroups [21, 22, 23,
26, 30], and ordered groupoids [4, 17]. Groupoids also appear naturally in the context
of partial group actions. Indeed, in [1] Abadie constructs a functor from the category of
partial actions to the category of groupoids. In [4, 5], partial actions of groupoids on rings
and the corresponding partial skew groupoid rings were introduced, and in a recent work
[20] Gon¸calves and Yoneda show that Leavitt path algebras can be realized as partial skew
groupoid rings.

Recall that a groupoid G is a small category with the property that all its morphisms are
isomorphisms. The family of objects and morphisms of G will be denoted by ob(G) and
mor(G), respectively. As usual one identiﬁes an object e with the identity morphism Ide,
so ob(G) ⊆ mor(G). If g ∈ mor(G), then the domain and codomain of g will be denoted by

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

d(g) and c(g), respectively. We let G2 denote the set of all pairs (g, h) ∈ mor(G) × mor(G)
that are composable, i.e. such that d(g) = c(h). Let R be a non-associative ring. By this
we mean that R is an additive group equipped with a multiplication which is distributive
with respect to addition. If R is unital, then its multiplicative identity is denoted by 1R
and is always assumed to be non-zero. The identity map R → R is denoted by idR. Recall
from [5] that α = {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G) is called a partial action of G on R if for each
g ∈ mor(G), Rg is an ideal of Rc(g), Rc(g) is an ideal of R and αg : Rg−1 → Rg is a ring
isomorphism satisfying the following three axioms:

(P1) if e ∈ ob(G), then αe = idRe;
(P2) if (g, h) ∈ G2, then R(gh)−1 ⊇ α−1
(P3) if (g, h) ∈ G2 and x ∈ α−1

h (Rh ∩ Rg−1);

h (Rh ∩ Rg−1), then (αg ◦ αh)(x) = αgh(x).

The associated partial skew groupoid ring R ⋆α G is the set of all ﬁnite formal sums
Pg∈mor(G) rgδg, where rg ∈ Rg, with addition deﬁned componentwise and multiplication
determined by the rule

(rgδg)(r′
(1)
if (g, h) ∈ G2, and (rgδg)(r′
hδh) = 0, otherwise. Since the ring structure of R ⋆α G only
depends on the choice of the rings Re, for e ∈ ob(G), we may take R to be any ring having
these rings as ideals. From this point of view, we may therefore assume that the following
fourth axiom holds:

hδh) = αg(αg−1(rg)r′

h)δgh,

(P4) R = ⊕e∈ob(G)Re.

By adding this fourth axiom we get another advantage. Namely, our deﬁnition of partial
groupoid actions, in the case when G is a group, i.e. when G has one object, now coincides
with the classical deﬁnition of partial group actions on rings. We say that α is unital if
every non-zero Rg is unital, for g ∈ mor(G). The action α is called global, if αgh = αgαh,
for (g, h) ∈ G2. It follows from [5, Lemma 1.1(i)] that α is global, if and only if Rg = Rc(g),
for all g ∈ mor(G). In that case, apart from the associativity requirement on R, R ⋆α G
coincides with the deﬁnition of a skew groupoid ring given in [28]. Here is an outline of
this article.

In Section 2, we recall some notions and results from non-associative ring theory that
we need in the sequel. In Section 3, we show the following generalizations of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. If α is a global unital action of a groupoid G on a non-associative ring R,
then the partial skew groupoid ring R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian, if and only if, R is left
(right) artinian and Rg = {0}, for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G).

Theorem 1.3. If α is a unital partial action of a groupoid G on an alternative ring R,
then the partial skew groupoid ring R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian, if and only if , R is left
(right) artinian and Rg = {0}, for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G).

A couple of remarks are needed here. First, notice that the condition that Rg = {0} for
all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G) can not, in general, be replaced by the statement that
mor(G) is ﬁnite in Theorem 1.2, nor in Theorem 1.3. To see this, let G be any inﬁnite
groupoid and let K be any left (or right) artinian non-associative ring, e.g. a ﬁeld. Fix

4

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

e ∈ ob(G) and put Re = K. If g ∈ mor(G) and g 6= e, then put Rg = {0}. Let αe = idK
and for g ∈ mor(G) with g 6= e, let αg : Rg−1 → Rg be the zero map. Then R ⋆α G = K
which is left (or right) artinian even though mor(G) is inﬁnite.

Secondly, it follows by [5, Theorem 2.1] that any unital partial groupoid action on a
unital ring R admits a globalization on a ring T , provided that R is associative. But
according to [16, Example 1.4] one can not guarantee that T is unital, not even in the
group case. Therefore, a Morita equivalence can in general not be used to deduce Theorem
1.3 from Theorem 1.2.

In the last two sections we show some applications of our main results. Namely, in Section
4, we generalize Connell’s result and provide a characterization of left (right) artinian
groupoid rings (see Theorem 4.1). We also characterize left (right) artinian generalized
matrix rings (see Corollary 4.2) and show an analogue of Connell’s result for partial group
algebras (see Corollary 4.3)

In Section 5 we recall the deﬁnition of a Leavitt path algebra and brieﬂy explain how it
can be realized as a partial skew group ring, using [19]. Thereafter, we apply our main
results and provide a characterization of artinian (and semisimple) Leavitt path algebras
(see Theorem 5.2).

2. Preliminaries on Rings and Modules

In this section, we recall some results from non-associative ring theory that we need in
the sequel. Throughout this section, let R and S denote non-associative rings with R a
subring of S. Recall that the center of R, denoted by Z(R), is the set of elements of R that
commute and associate with all elements of R. In other words, an element x ∈ R belongs
to Z(R) precisely when for every choice of r, r′ ∈ R, we have that xr = rx, (xr)r′ = x(rr′),
(rx)r′ = r(xr′) and (rr′)x = r(r′x).

Proposition 2.1. If R is unital and simple, then Z(R) is a ﬁeld.

Proof. See e.g. [31, Proposition 9].

(cid:3)

By a left R-module we mean an additive group M equipped with a biadditive map
R × M ∋ (r, m) 7→ rm ∈ M satisfying r(sm) = (rs)m, for r, s ∈ R and m ∈ M.
In
that case, if R is unital and 1Rm = m, for m ∈ M, then we say that M is unital as a
left R-module. By a left R-submodule of M we mean an additive subgroup N of M such
that if n ∈ N and r ∈ R, then rn ∈ N. Recall that M is called artinian if it satisﬁes the
descending chain condition on its poset of submodules. The ring R is called left artinian if
it is artinian as a left module over itself. The notion of a right module and a right artinian
ring are deﬁned analogously. If the ring R is both left and right artinian, then it is said to
be artinian.

Proposition 2.2. Suppose that M is a left (right) S-module. If M is artinian as a left
(right) R-module, then M is artinian as a left (right) S-module.

Proof. This follows immediately from the fact that R ⊆ S.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.3. Suppose that R is a direct summand of the left (right) R-module S.
Then, for any right (left) ideal I of R, the relation IS ∩ R = IR (SI ∩ R = RI) holds. In
particular, if S is right (left) artinian and R is unital, then R is right (left) artinian.

Proof. Let T be a left (right) R-module such that S = R ⊕ T as left (right) R-modules.
Let I be a right (left) ideal of R. Then IS ∩ R = [I(R ⊕ T )] ∩ R = [IR ⊕ IT ] ∩ R = IR,
(SI ∩ R = RI). In particular, if R is unital, then we get IR = I (RI = I) from which the
last part follows.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.4. Let R be a unital ring. Suppose that M is a left (right) R-module and
that N is a left (right) R-submodule of M. Then M is artinian, if and only if, N and
M/N are artinian.

Proof. See [34, Proposition 0.2.19].

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.5. Let R be a unital ring. Suppose that M is a left (right) R-module. If
M1, . . . , Mn are left (right) R-submodules of M such that M = M1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Mn, then M is
artinian, if and only if, Mi is artinian for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

Proof. We can use Proposition 2.4. The “only if” statement is clear. For the “if” statement,
consider the case i = 2 and notice that M1 is a left (right) R-submodule of M1 ⊕ M2 and
that (M1 ⊕ M2)/M1
(cid:3)

∼= M2. The general case now follows by induction over i.

The term ideal refers to two-sided ideal, unless otherwise stated. The ring R is called
simple if {0} and R are the only ideals of R. An ideal I of R is called maximal if I ( R
and for every ideal J of R with I ⊆ J ( R, the relation I = J holds. Notice that an ideal
I of R is maximal if and only if R/I is simple. The ring R is called semisimple if it is a
ﬁnite direct sum of simple rings. Following [7], the intersection of all maximal ideals of R,
denoted by S(R), will be called the simplicial radical of R.

Proposition 2.6. If R is unital and left (right) artinian, then R/S(R) is semisimple.

Proof. See [11, Theorem 1.7 on p. 6].

(cid:3)

Recall that R is called alternative if for all x, y ∈ R, the relations x2y = x(xy) and
xy2 = (xy)y hold. If R is alternative, then one may deﬁne a radical of R, denoted J (R),
similar to the Jacobson radical from the associative setting. In the alternative setting J (R)
is often called the Zhevlakov radical of R (see [36, p. 210]). In that case, J is hereditary
in the following sense.

Proposition 2.7. If R is left (right) artinian and I is an ideal of R, then J (I) = I ∩J (R).

Proof. See [36, Theorem 3 on p. 204].

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.8. If R is a unital alternative left (right) artinian ring, then S(R) = J (R)
and R/J (R) is semisimple.

Proof. For the equality S(R) = J (R), see [11, Proposition 1.2(ii) on p. 94]. The semisim-
plicity of R/J (R) now follows from Proposition 2.6 (or [36, Corollary on p. 250]).

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

Remark 1. The proofs of Propositions 2.6-2.8, as they appear in [11] and [36], presuppose
that R is an algebra over a ﬁeld. However, it is clear from those proofs that the algebra
structure of R is not needed, and therefore one can suppose that R is only a ring. Moreover,
the proofs only require R to be left or right artinian.

3. Partial Skew Groupoid Rings

In this section, we show Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. We assume that G is a groupoid,
that R is a non-associative ring and that α = {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G) is a partial action
of G on R.

Proposition 3.1. If R is left (right) artinian, and Rg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many
g ∈ mor(G), then R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian.

Proof. Put S = R ⋆α G and S0 = ⊕e∈ob(G)Reδe. Since R is an artinian ring we get by
Proposition 2.4 that Rc(g) is also an artinian ring. The same proposition implies that
Rgδg is artinian as a left (right) module over Rc(g)δc(g) (Rd(g)δd(g)). Therefore, for each
g ∈ mor(G), we get, from Proposition 2.2, that Rgδg is artinian as a left (right) S0-module.
Proposition 2.5 now implies that S is artinian as a left (right) S0-module. Thus, by
Proposition 2.2, the ring S is left (right) artinian.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2. If R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian, then Re = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many
e ∈ ob(G).

Proof. Put S = R ⋆α G. Seeking a contradiction, suppose that there is an inﬁnite set of
diﬀerent elements {ei}i∈N in ob(G) such that for every i ∈ N, there is a non-zero ri ∈ Rei.
Suppose that S is left artinian. Deﬁne a set of left ideals {Ii}i∈N of S by Ii = ⊕g∈GiRgδg,
for i ∈ N, where Gi = {g ∈ mor(G) | d(g) ∈ {ei, ei+1, ei+2, . . .}}. For each i ∈ N and
ri ∈ Rei, we get that riδei ∈ Ii \ Ii+1. Hence {Ii}i∈N is a strictly descending chain of left
ideals of S, which is a contradiction.

Suppose that S is right artinian. Deﬁne a set of right ideals {Ii}i∈N of S by Ii =
⊕g∈GiRgδg, for i ∈ N, where Gi = {g ∈ mor(G) | c(g) ∈ {ei, ei+1, ei+2, . . .}}. For each
i ∈ N and ri ∈ Rei, we get that riδei ∈ Ii \ Ii+1. Hence {Ii}i∈N is a strictly descending
chain of right ideals of S, which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.3. If α is unital and R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian, then R is left (right)
artinian.

Proof. Put S = R ⋆α G and S0 = ⊕e∈ob(G)Reδe. By Proposition 3.2, we can write S0 =
⊕n
i=1Reiδei, for e1, . . . , en ∈ ob(G) such that Re1, . . . , Ren are all non-zero. Then S0 is unital
with multiplicative identity given by Pn
δei. Since S0 is a direct summand in S as a
left (right) S0-module, we get, from Proposition 2.3, that S0 is left (right) artinian. Our
assertion now follows from (P4).
(cid:3)

i=1 1Rei

Take e, f ∈ ob(G). We let G(e, f ) denote the set of morphisms in G with domain e
and codomain f . The set G(e, e) is a group, which we will denote by Ge. Notice that
β = {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈Ge is a partial (group) action of Ge on Re.

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

Proposition 3.4. The set mor(G) is ﬁnite, if and only if, ob(G) is ﬁnite and for each
e ∈ ob(G), the group Ge is ﬁnite.

Proof. The “only if” statement is clear. Now we show the “if” statement. Suppose that
ob(G) is ﬁnite and that for each e ∈ ob(G), the group Ge is ﬁnite. Since mor(G) =
Se,f ∈ob(G) G(e, f ), one only needs to show that G(e, f ) is ﬁnite, for all e, f ∈ ob(G). Notice
that if G(e, f ) is non-empty, then we have a bijection Ge ∋ g 7→ hg ∈ G(e, f ), where h is
a ﬁxed element in G(e, f ). Hence, G(e, f ) is ﬁnite as desired.
(cid:3)

Recall that a subgroupoid of G is a subcategory of G that is a groupoid in itself. Deﬁne the
subgroupoid G# of G in the following way. The objects of G# are all e ∈ ob(G) with Re non-
zero. The morphisms of G# are all morphisms g ∈ mor(G) with d(g), c(g) ∈ ob(G#). Put
R# = ⊕e∈ob(G#)Re and let α# denote the restriction of α to G#. Then R⋆α G = R# ⋆α# G#.
Also, recall that a subring A of R is called G-invariant, if αg(A ∩ Rg−1) ⊆ A, for any
g−1 := Rg−1 ∩A, for g ∈ mor(G),

g ∈ mor(G). In this case, the restriction of α to the ideals R′
gives rise to a partial action of G on A.

Proposition 3.5. Let α be global and unital. If R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian and for each
e ∈ ob(G#), Re is simple, then mor(G#) is ﬁnite.
Proof. Put S = R⋆αG = R#⋆α# G# and take e ∈ ob(G) with Re non-zero. Put F = Z(Re).
Then F is Ge-invariant and since Re is simple, we get, by Proposition 2.1, that F is a ﬁeld.
Let β be the induced group action of Ge on F . Put T = F ⋆β Ge. We claim that T is a
direct summand in S as a right (left) T -module. Assume, for a moment, that the claim
holds. From Lemma 2.5 it follows that T is left (right) artinian. By Theorem 1.1, we
get that Ge is ﬁnite. From Proposition 3.2 and Proposition 3.4, we have that mor(G#) is
ﬁnite. Now we show the claim. Since F is a ﬁeld, there is an F -subspace V of Re such
that Re = F ⊕ V as vector spaces over F . Put T ′ = (⊕g∈G(e,e)V δg) ⊕ (⊕g∈mor(G)\GeRc(g)δg).
It is clear that S = T ⊕ T ′ as additive groups. What remains to show now is that T ′ is
a right (left) T -module. We will only show the “right” part since the “left” part can be
shown in an analogous manner. To this end, take f ∈ F and g ∈ Ge.
If h ∈ Ge and
v ∈ V , then (vδh)(f δg) = vαh(f )δhg ∈ ⊕g∈GeV δg, since F is Ge-invariant and V is a right
F -vector space. Suppose now that h ∈ mor(G) \ Ge and r ∈ Rc(h).
If d(h) 6= e, then
(rδh)(f δg) = 0 ∈ T ′.
If d(h) = e, then c(h) 6= e and hence hg ∈ mor(G) \ Ge. Thus
(rδh)(f δg) ∈ ⊕g∈mor(G)\GeRc(g)δg ⊆ T ′.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.6. If α is a unital partial action, R is semisimple and R ⋆α G is left (right)
artinian, then Rg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G).

Proof. Write R = R1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Rn as a direct sum of simple rings. Put n = {1, . . . , n}.
Then, for every g ∈ G, Rg is the direct sum of a non-empty subset of {Ri}i∈n. Deﬁne a
new category G in the following way. As objects we take all (i, e) ∈ n × ob(G) such that
Ri is a direct summand in Re. As morphisms we take all formal expressions of the form
jgi, for i, j ∈ n and g ∈ mor(G), such that Ri is a direct summand in Rg−1, Rj is a direct
summand in Rg and αg(Ri) = Rj. Deﬁne the domain d and codomain c by the relations
d(jgi) = (i, d(g)) and c(jgi) = (j, c(g)), for jgi ∈ mor(G). The composition of kgj and jhi in

8

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

mor(G) is deﬁned by the relation (kgj)(jhi) = k(gh)i. Notice that since αe = idRe, for each
(i, e) ∈ ob(G), iei is the identity morphism at (i, e). It is clear that G is a groupoid, where
for jgi ∈ mor(G), one has (jgi)−1 = i(g−1)j. For each jgi ∈ mor(G), put Rj gi = Rj = Rj c(g)j
and αj gi = pj ◦ αg ◦ qi, where pj : R → Rj is the projection onto the jth coordinate and
→ Rj gi} is
qi : Ri → R is the injection deﬁned by inclusion. Then α = {αj gi : R
#

a global action of G on R such that R ⋆α G = R ⋆α G. Notice that G
= G. Thus, by
Proposition 3.5, we get that mor(G) is a ﬁnite set. Put G = {g ∈ mor(G) | Rg is non-zero}.
For each g ∈ G, ﬁx i(g), j(g) ∈ n such that j(g)gi(g) ∈ mor(G). It is clear that the map
G ∋ g 7→ j(g)gi(g) ∈ mor(G) is injective. Thus, G is also ﬁnite.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. The “if” statement follows from Proposition 3.1. Now we show
the only “if” statement. Suppose that α is a global and unital action of a groupoid G on
R such that R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian. We wish to show that R is left (right) artinian
and that Rg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G). The ﬁrst claim follows from
Proposition 3.3. Now we show the second claim. For a ring S, put S = S/S(S). For a
ring isomorphism f : S → T , let f : S → T be the natural map. Since α is a global action
of G on R, the collection of maps α := {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G) is a global action of G
on R = ⊕e∈ob(G)Re. Since, for every g ∈ mor(G) with Rg 6= {0}, Rg is unital and left
(right) artinian, the ring Rg is also non-zero and, by Proposition 2.6, semisimple. Since
R ⋆α G is an epimorphic image of R ⋆α G, we get that R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian. Now,
by Proposition 3.6 we get that Rg = S(Rg) for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G), and the
claim follows from the fact that the ideals Rg are unital.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.3. The “if” statement follows from Proposition 3.1. Now we show
the “only if” statement. Suppose that α is a partial action of a groupoid G on an alternative
ring R such that R ⋆α G is left (right) artinian. We shall prove that R is left (right) artinian
and that Rg = {0}, for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ mor(G). The ﬁrst claim follows from
Proposition 3.3. Now we show the second claim. For a ring S, put S = S/J (S). For a
ring isomorphism f : S → T , let f : S → T be the natural map. Take g ∈ mor(G). Then
Rg can be viewed as an ideal of Rc(g). Indeed, the inclusion i : Rg → Rc(g) induces a well
deﬁned ring homomorphism i′ : Rg → Rc(g). By Proposition 2.7, we get that i′ induces a
well deﬁned injective ring homomorphism i′′ : Rg → Rc(g). If we use i′′ to identify each
element of Rg with its image in Rc(g), then Rg can be viewed as an ideal of Rc(g). It is
clear that the axioms (P1)-(P4), from the introduction, hold for the collection of maps
α := {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G). Since, for every g ∈ mor(G) with Rg 6= {0}, Rg is
unital, the ring Rg is also non-zero and, by Proposition 2.8, semisimple. Since R ⋆α G is an
epimorphic image of R ⋆α G, we get that R ⋆α G is artinian. The claim now follows from
Proposition 3.6 and the fact that α is unital.

4. Applications to Groupoid rings, Partial group rings and Matrix rings

Let G be a groupoid. Deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼ on ob(G) by saying that if
e, f ∈ ob(G), then e ∼ f if there is g ∈ mor(G) with d(g) = e and c(g) = f . Let E be a
set of representatives for the diﬀerent equivalence classes of ∼. For each e ∈ E, let Re be a
unital non-associative ring and put R = ⊕e∈ob(G)Re. For each g ∈ mor(G), let e(g) denote
the unique element in E such that c(g) ∼ e(g). For each g ∈ mor(G), put Rg = Re(g) and
let αg : Rg−1 → Rg be the identity map. Then {αg : Rg−1 → Rg}g∈mor(G) is a partial action
of the groupoid G on R. The corresponding partial skew groupoid ring R ⋆α G coincides
with the groupoid ring R[G] of G over R. Using the above notation, we get the following
generalization of Connell’s classical result for group rings [7, Theorem 1].

Theorem 4.1. The groupoid ring R[G] is left (right) artinian if and only if mor(G) is
ﬁnite and for each e ∈ E, the ring Re is left (right) artinian.

Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 1.2.

(cid:3)

Remark 2. Zelmanov [35] has shown that if the semigroup ring R[S] is left (or right)
artinian for an associative ring R, then the semigroup S must be ﬁnite. In [25] Kozhukhov
showed that Zelmanov’s result can not be generalized to (non-associative) magma rings.
Theorem 4.1 appears to be the ﬁrst generalization of Connell’s result which applies to
non-associative rings.

Let I be a non-empty set and suppose that T is a unital non-associative ring. Deﬁne a
groupoid I in the following way. As objects of I we take the elements of I. As morphisms
of I we take the elements of I × I. Take i, j, k ∈ I. We put d(i, j) = j and c(i, j) = i. The
composition of (i, j) with (j, k), denoted (i, j)(j, k), is deﬁned to be (i, k). The equivalence
relation ∼, from above, only has one equivalence class for the groupoid I. In other words,
I is connected. Thus, if we let Re = T , for e ∈ ob(G), then the skew groupoid ring R ⋆α I
coincides with the generalized matrix ring MI(T ). With the above notation, we get the
following result.

Corollary 4.2. The generalized matrix ring MI(T ) is left (right) artinian if and only if I
is ﬁnite and T is left (right) artinian.

Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 4.1.

(cid:3)

Given a ﬁeld K and a group G one may deﬁne the partial group algebra Kpar[G] (see e.g.

[10]).

Corollary 4.3. Let K be a ﬁeld and let G be a group. The partial group algebra Kpar[G]
is artinian if and only if G is a ﬁnite group.

Proof. We ﬁrst show the “if” statement. Using that G is a ﬁnite group we get that the
Brandt groupoid of G, denoted by Γ, is ﬁnite. By [10, Corollary 2.7], the partial group
algebra Kpar[G] is isomorphic (as a K-algebra) to the groupoid algebra K[Γ]. The desired
conclusion now follows immediately from Theorem 4.1.

10

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

Now we show the “only if” statement. By [9, Theorem 6.9], Kpar[G] is isomorphic (as
a K-algebra) to a certain partial skew group ring A ⋊α˜π G associated to a partial action
{{α˜π
g }g∈G, {Dg}g∈G}. For each g ∈ G, Dg contains the (non-zero) identity element [g][g−1]
(where [g], [g−1] are elements of Exel’s semigroup). Hence, if Kpar[G] is artinian, then, by
Theorem 1.2, Dg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ G. This shows that G is ﬁnite.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.4. The “only if” statement of Corollary 4.3 can also be obtained through
Zelmanov’s theorem [35]. Indeed, Kpar[G] can be viewed as a semigroup algebra by Exel’s
semigroup.

5. Applications to Leavitt path algebras

A directed graph E = (E0, E1, r, s) consists of two countable sets E0, E1 and maps
r, s : E1 → E0. The elements of E0 are called vertices and the elements of E1 are called
edges. If both E0 and E1 are ﬁnite sets, then we say that E is ﬁnite. A vertex which
emits no edge is called a sink. A vertex v ∈ E0 such that |s−1(v)| = ∞ is called an inﬁnite
emitter. A path µ in E is a sequence of edges µ = µ1 . . . µn such that r(µi) = s(µi+1) for
i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. In such a case, s(µ) := s(µ1) is the source of µ, r(µ) := r(µn) is the
range of µ and n is the length of µ. Recall that a path µ is called a cycle if s(µ) = r(µ)
and s(µi) 6= s(µj) for every i 6= j. A graph E without cycles is said to be acyclic.

Deﬁnition 5.1 (Leavitt path algebra [2]). Let E be any directed graph and let K be
any ﬁeld. The Leavitt path K-algebra LK(E) of E with coeﬃcients in K is the K-algebra
generated by a set {v | v ∈ E0} of pairwise orthogonal idempotents, together with a set of
variables {f | f ∈ E1} ∪ {f ∗ | f ∈ E1}, which satisfy the following relations:

(1) s(f )f = f r(f ) = f , for all f ∈ E1;
(2) r(f )f ∗ = f ∗s(f ) = f ∗, for all f ∈ E1;
(3) f ∗f ′ = δf,f ′r(f ), for all f, f ′ ∈ E1;
(4) v = P{f ∈E1|s(f )=v} f f ∗, for every v ∈ E0 for which s−1(v) is non-empty and ﬁnite.

In [19] Gon¸calves and Royer have shown that the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) is isomor-
phic (as a K-algebra) to a partial skew group ring D(X) ⋆α F, where D(X) is a certain
commutative K-algebra and F is the free group generated by E1. For the beneﬁt of the
reader we shall brieﬂy recall the construction of D(X) ⋆α F.

Let W denote the set of all ﬁnite paths in E, and let W ∞ denote the set of all inﬁnite
paths in E. Let F denote the free group genereated by E1. We are going to deﬁne a partial
action of F on the set

X = {ξ ∈ W | r(ξ) is a sink } ∪ {v ∈ E0 | v is a sink } ∪ W ∞.

For each g ∈ F, let Xg be deﬁned as follows:

• Xe := X, where e is the identity element of F.
• Xb−1 := {ξ ∈ X | s(ξ) = r(b)}, for all b ∈ W .
• Xa := {ξ ∈ X | ξ1ξ2...ξ|a| = a}, for all a ∈ W .
• Xab−1 := {ξ ∈ X | ξ1ξ2...ξ|a| = a} = Xa, for ab−1 ∈ F with a, b ∈ W , r(a) = r(b)

and ab−1 in its reduced form.

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

11

• Xg := ∅, for all other g ∈ F.

Let θe : Xe → Xe be the identity map. For b ∈ W , θb : Xb−1 → Xb is deﬁned by
θb(ξ) = bξ, and θb−1 : Xb → Xb−1 by θb−1(η) = η|b|+1η|b|+2 . . . if r(b) is not a sink, and
by θb−1(b) = r(b) if r(b) is a sink. Finally, for a, b ∈ W with r(a) = r(b) and ab−1 in
reduced form, θab−1 : Xba−1 → Xab−1 is deﬁned by θab−1(ξ) = aξ(|b|+1)ξ(|b|+2) . . ., with inverse
θba−1 : Xab−1 → Xba−1 deﬁned by θba−1(η) = bη(|a|+1)η(|a|+2) . . . .

One may easily verify that {{Xg}g∈F, {θg}g∈F} is a partial action on the set level which
induces a partial action on the algebra level.
Indeed, we may deﬁne a partial action
{{F (Xg)}g∈F, {αg}g∈F}, where, for each g ∈ F, F (Xg) denotes the algebra of all functions
from Xg to K, and by putting αg(f ) := f ◦ θg−1 we have a K-algebra isomorphism αg :
F (Xg−1) → F (Xg). Based on this partial action, we deﬁne another partial action in the
following way:

For each g ∈ F, and for each v ∈ E0, deﬁne the characteristic maps 1g := χXg and
1v := χXv, where Xv = {ξ ∈ X | s(ξ) = v}. Notice that 1g is the identity element of
F (Xg). Finally, let

D(X) = De = span{{1g | g ∈ F \ {0}} ∪ {1v | v ∈ E0}},

(where span means the K-linear span) and, for each g ∈ F\{0}, let Dg ⊆ F (Xg) be deﬁned
as 1gDe, that is,

Dg = span{1g1h | h ∈ F}.

By [19, Lemma 2.4], D(X) is a K-algebra and Dg, for g ∈ F, is an ideal of D(X). Using that
αg(1g−11h) = 1g1gh (see [19, Lemma 2.6]), for each g ∈ F, it is clear that the restriction
of αg to Dg−1 is a bijection onto Dg. By abuse of notation this restriction map will
also be denoted by αg. Clearly, αg : Dg−1 → Dg is an isomorphism of K-algebras and,
furthermore, {{αg}g∈F, {Dg}g∈F} is a partial action. By [19, Proposition 3.2] the map
ϕ : LK(E) → D(X) ⋆α F deﬁned by ϕ(f ) = 1f δf , ϕ(f ∗) = 1f −1δf −1, for all f ∈ E1, and
ϕ(v) = 1vδe, for all v ∈ E0, is an isomorphism of K-algebras.

Theorem 5.2. Let K be a ﬁeld and let E be a directed graph. Consider LK(E), the Leavitt
path K-algebra of E with coeﬃcients in K. The following ﬁve assertions are equivalent:

(i) E is ﬁnite and acyclic;
(ii) LK(E) is left artinian;
(iii) LK(E) is right artinian;
(iv) LK(E) is artinian;
(v) LK(E) is unital and semisimple.

Proof. Throughout this proof we are going to make use of the fact that the Leavitt path
algebra LK(E) is isomorphic to the partial skew group ring D(X) ⋆α F, as described above.
(i)⇒(ii): If we can show that D(X) is left artinian and that Dg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely

many g ∈ F, then it follows by Theorem 1.3 that D(X) ⋆α F is an artinian ring.

By the ﬁniteness and acyclicity of E we immediately conclude that there are no inﬁnite
paths in E and that W , the set of all ﬁnite paths in E, is a ﬁnite set. Hence, using the
notation of [19] we see that X = {ξ ∈ W | r(ξ) is a sink} ∪ {v ∈ E0 | v is a sink} is a

12

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

ﬁnite set. Using that W is ﬁnite, we conclude that Xg = ∅ for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ F.
Hence, 1g = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ F. Using this, we immediately conclude that
Dg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ F, and moreover, we notice that it turns D(X) into
a ﬁnite-dimensional K-vector space. Hence, D(X) is artinian.

(ii)⇒(i): Suppose that LK(E) ∼= D(X) ⋆α F is left artinian. By Theorem 1.3, we get

that Dg = {0} for all but ﬁnitely many g ∈ F.

We claim that there can be no inﬁnite path in E, i.e. W ∞ = ∅. Clearly, every cycle gives
rise to an inﬁnite path. Thus, if we assume that the claim holds, then E must be acyclic.
Now we prove the claim. Seeking a contradiction, suppose that E contains an inﬁnite path
ξ = ξ1ξ2ξ3 . . .. By taking (ﬁnite) initial subpaths of ξ, which are elements of W and hence
also of F, we can form an inﬁnite chain of nested subsets

which are all non-empty since they contain ξ. Thus, the ideals

Xξ1 ⊇ Xξ1ξ2 ⊇ Xξ1ξ2ξ3 ⊇ . . .

Dξ1, Dξ1ξ2, Dξ1ξ2ξ3,

. . .

are all non-zero. Hence, Dg 6= {0} for inﬁnitely many g ∈ F. This is a contradiction.

Now we show that E must be ﬁnite. Seeking a contradiction, suppose that E0 =
{v1, v2, v3, . . .} is inﬁnite. Notice that LK(E) = ⊕v∈E0LK(E)v and consider the follow-
ing descending chain of left ideals of LK(E).

LK(E) ⊇ ⊕v∈E0\{v1}LK(E)v ⊇ ⊕v∈E0\{v1,v2}LK(E)v ⊇ ⊕v∈E0\{v1,v2,v3}LK(E)v ⊇ . . .

It is easy to see that the above chain never stabilizes, using the fact that the elements
of E0 are mutually orthogonal idempotents. Hence, LK(E) is not left artinian. This is a
contradiction. We conclude that E0 is ﬁnite.

We now proceed to show that E1 must be ﬁnite. Using that E0 is ﬁnite, it is suﬃcient
to show that E0 contains no inﬁnite emitter. Seeking a contradiction, suppose that there
is a vertex v ∈ E0 which is an inﬁnite emitter. Since E0 is ﬁnite, there must exist some
u ∈ E0 such that the set I = {e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and r(e) = u} is inﬁnite.

Case 1: (u is a sink)

Take e ∈ I ⊆ W and consider the set Xe−1 = {ξ ∈ X | s(ξ) = u} which is non-empty since
it contains u. Hence, De−1 is non-zero for (inﬁnitely many) e ∈ I. This is a contradiction.

Case 2: (u is not a sink)

We have already shown that E contains no inﬁnite path, i.e. W ∞ = ∅. Hence, there must
exist at least one path from u to a sink w. Let us call it η. Take e ∈ I and consider the
set Xe−1 = {ξ ∈ X | s(ξ) = u} which is non-empty since it contains η. Hence, De−1 is
non-zero for (inﬁnitely many) e ∈ I. This is a contradiction.

This shows that E1 (and hence also E) is ﬁnite.
(ii)⇔(iii)⇔(iv): This follows immediately from Theorem 1.3, using the fact that D(X)

is commutative.

(iv)⇒(v): By [2, Proposition 6.3] we know that LK(E) is semiprimitive, i.e. J(LK(E)) =
{0}. Hence, if LK(E) is left artinian it must also be semisimple (see e.g.
[27, Theorem
4.14]). Using that (iv)⇔(i) we get that E is ﬁnite and hence, in particular, LK(E) is unital.

ARTINIAN PARTIAL SKEW GROUPOID RINGS

(v)⇒(iv): This is clear.

Remark 5.3. The essence of the above result has previously been shown in [3] using a
diﬀerent technique.

Recall that a subset H ⊆ E0 is said to be hereditary if for any e ∈ E1 we have that
s(e) ∈ H implies r(e) ∈ H. A hereditary subset H ⊆ E0 is called saturated if whenever
0 < |s−1(v)| < ∞, then {r(e) ∈ H | e ∈ E1 and s(e) = v} ⊆ H implies v ∈ H.

Corollary 5.4. If E is a ﬁnite and acyclic graph such that the only hereditary and saturated
subsets of E0 are ∅ and E0, then the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) is a simple unital artinian
ring.

Proof. Since E is acyclic it trivially satisﬁes condition (L), see [18]. By [18, Theorem 3.5]
we conclude that LK(E) is simple. We get from Theorem 5.2 that LK(E) is a simple unital
artinian ring.
