Abstract We present the physical and geometrical parameters of the individual compo-
nents of the close visual double-lined spectroscopic binary system Gliese 762.1, which
were estimated using Al-Wardat’s complex method for analyzing close visual binary sys-
tems. The estimated parameters of the individual components of the system are as fol-
lows: radius RA = 0.845 ± 0.09R⊙, RB = 0.795 ± 0.10R⊙, effective temperature
eﬀ = 5150 ± 50 K, surface gravity log gA = 4.52 ± 0.10, log
eﬀ = 5300 ± 50 K, T B
T A
gB = 4.54 ± 0.15 and luminosity LA = 0.51 ± 0.08L⊙, LB = 0.40 ± 0.07L⊙. New
orbital elements are presented with a semi-major axis of 0.0865 ± 0.010 arcsec using the
Hippracos parallax π = 58.96 ± 0.65 mas, and an accurate total mass and individual
masses of the system are determined as M = 1.72 ± 0.60M⊙, MA = 0.89 ± 0.08M⊙
and MB = 0.83 ± 0.07M⊙. Finally, the spectral types and luminosity classes of both
components are assigned as K0V and K1.5V for the primary and secondary components
respectively, and their positions on the H-R diagram and evolutionary tracks are given.

1 INTRODUCTION

The importance of the study of binary stars arises from the fact that more than 50% among nearby
solar-type main-sequence stars are binary or multiple stellar systems (the fraction is 42% among nearby
M stars Duquennoy et al. (1991)) and several astronomical phenomena occur only in binary stars. They
provide a source of direct measurements of stellar parameters or galactic quantities. Stellar physics needs
masses, luminosities and radii obtained through the studies of binary stars. Galactic physics beneﬁts
also from these studies, e.g. the galactic potential can be tested using wide binaries, and the chemical
evolution depends on binaries through the supernovae Ia process
(Arenou et al. 2002). The mass-
luminosity relation of low-mass main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are known with much
lower accuracy than those of massive early-type stars Balega et al. (2002, 2007b); Forveille et al. (1999),
this requires precise determination of their masses and luminosities.

The close visual binary stars (CVBS) are visually close enough to be resolved except by special
techniques like speckle interferometry or by deducing their duplicity using high resolution spectroscopy.

S. G. Masda et al.

So, the case is a bit complicated and needs indirect methods to estimate their physical and geometrical
parameters.

Combining observational measurements with stellar theoretical models is the most powerful indirect
method to analyze such binary and multiple systems. This was implemented in Al-Wardat’s complex
method (Al-Wardat 2007), which combines magnitude difference measurements of speckle interferom-
etry, entire spectral energy distribution (SED) of spectrophotometry and radial velocity measurements,
all along with atmospheres modeling to estimate the individual physical parameters. In coordination
with these physical parameters, the geometrical parameters and their errors are calculated using a mod-
ern version of Tokovinin’s ORBITX program, which depends on the standard least-squares method
Tokovinin (1992).

The method was ﬁrstly introduced by Al-Wardat (2002a, 2007)(henceforth paper I and paper II
in this series respectively), where it was applied to the analysis of the quadruple hierarchical system
ADS11061 and the two binary systems COU1289 and COU1291 . Later on, the method was successfully
applied to several solar-type and subgiant binary systems: Hip11352, Hip11253 and Hip689 Al-Wardat
(2009); Al-Wardat & Widyan (2009); Al-Wardat (2012) (henceforth papers III, IV and V in this series
respectively).

The method was then developed to a complex one by combining the physical solution with the
geometrical one represented by the orbital solution of the system and applied to the systems: HD25811,
HD375, Gliese 150.5 and HD6009 Al-Wardat et al. (2014a,b,c); Al-Wardat (2014) (henceforth papers
VI, VII, VIII and IX in this series respectively).

In order to be analyzed using Al-Wardat’s method, the binary system should have a magnitude
difference measurement, an observational entire SED covering the optical range, and a precise entire
optical (UBV) photometrical magnitude measurement. The procedure starts with calculating the indi-
vidual ﬂux of each component using the magnitude difference with the entire photometrical magnitude,
then estimating their preliminary effective temperatures and gravity accelerations in order to build their
SED using grids of Kurucz (1994) blanketed models (ATLAS9). These two models in their turn are used
to build a synthetic entire SED for the system, which compares with the observational one in an iterative
way until the best ﬁt is achieved. Of course there should be a coincidence between the masses calculated
using the physical solution and those calculated using the orbital one, otherwise a new set of parameters
would be tested.

This is the tenth paper in this series, which gives a complete analysis of the CVBS Gliese 762.1

using Al-Wardat’s complex method.

Gliese 762.1 (MCA 56 AB = WDS J19311+5835 = GJ 762.1 = HD 184467 = HIP 95995) was
ﬁrst visually resolved by McAlister et al. (1983). It is a well known double-lined spectroscopic binary
(SB2) Pourbaix & Jorissen (2000), with an orbital period of 1.35 year Batten et al. (1989). It shines at
an apparent visual magnitude of mv = 6.m60 and the spectral types of both components are catalogued
as K2V and K4V for the primary and secondary components respectively Farrington et al. (2010).
Hipparcos trigonometric parallax measurement of the system as π = 58.96 ± 0.65 mas van Leeuwen
(2007) places this system at a distance of 16.96 pc, being one of the nearby K-type stars.

Table 1 contains basic data of the system Gliese 762.1 from SIMBAD, NASA/IPAC, Hipparcos and

Tycho Catalogues ESA (1997).

2 ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM

2.1 Atmospheres modelling and the estimation of the physical parameters

In spite of the fact that the duplicity of the system was detected using high resolution spectroscopy and
speckle interferometry, the system is seen as a single star even with the aid of the biggest telescopes. So,
in order to estimate the physical parameters of the individual components of the system, we followed
Al-Wardat’s complex method for analyzing CVBS. The synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
of the individual components of the system are computed using ATLAS9 line blanketed model atmo-

spheres of Kurucz (1994) using a special subroutine. In order to build the model atmospheres of each
components, we need preliminary input parameters (Tef f and log g), these are calculated as follows:

Using the apparent visual magnitude of the system mv = 6.m60 from the previous data (Table 1),
and the visual magnitude difference △m = 0.m33 ± 0.06 between the two components as the average
of ﬁfteen △m measurements of the ﬁlters λ 503 -850 (Table 2), we calculated a preliminary individual
mv for each component using the following equations:

mA = mv + 2.5 log(1 + 10−0.4∆m),
mB = mA + ∆m,

(1)
(2)

which give:

v = 7.m20 ± 0.03, mB

mA
Combining these magnitudes with the Hipparcos trigonometric parallax (πHip) from van Leeuwen
(2007), we can derive the preliminary absolute magnitudes for the components using the following
relation:

v = 7.m53 ± 0.07.

MV = mv + 5 − 5 log(d) − Av

as follows: M A

V = 5.m85 ± 0.04 and M B

V = 6.m18 ± 0.07, where Av is the interstellar reddening which

The bolometric corrections(B.C.), bolometric magnitudes and the stellar luminosities of the system
were taken from Lang (1992) and Gray (2005). These values, along with the following two equations:

log(R/R⊙) = 0.5 log(L/L⊙) − 2 log(Tef f /T⊙),
log g = log(M/M⊙) − 2 log(R/R⊙) + 4.43

4.56, log gB = 4.54 and RA = 0.815R⊙, RB = 0.806R⊙. T⊙ were taken as 5777K.

λ and H B

The exact physical parameters of the components of the system are those which lead to the best ﬁt
between the entire synthetic SED and the observational one, which was taken form Al-Wardat (2002b).
The observational spectrum (Fig. 1) was obtained using a low resolution grating (325/4◦ grooves/mm,
˚A/px reciprocal dispersion) within the UAGS spectrograph at the 1m (Zeiss-1000) SAO-Russian tele-
scope.

Beside the visual best ﬁt between the two spectra, the synthetic magnitudes, color indices and line
proﬁles especially those of Hydrogen Hβ(4861.33 ˚A), Hγ(4340.5 ˚A) and Hδ(4101 ˚A) should ﬁt the
observational ones. Otherwise, a new set of parameters would be tested in iterated way until the best ﬁt
is reached.

The best ﬁt (Fig. 1) was achieved using the parameters shown in Table 4. The luminosities and
masses of the components were calculated using Equs. 4 and 5, and the spectral types of the components
of the system were derived from Lang (1992) empirical Sp − MV relation for main sequence stars.

2.2 Orbital solution and Masses

Once available, the orbital elements of a binary system would enhance and help in examining the phys-
ical parameters of its individual components. The mass sum of the two components given by equations
8 and 9 should coincide with that estimated from their positions on the evolutionary tracks and that
calculated using the empirical equations and standard tables.

We followed Tokovinin’s method Tokovinin (1992) to calculate the orbital elements. The method
performs a least-squares adjustment to all available radial velocity and relative position observations,
with weights inversely proportional to the square of their standard errors. The orbital solution involves:
the orbital period, P; the semi-amplitudes of the primary and secondary velocities, K1 and K2; the
eccentricity, e; the semi-major axis, a; the center of mass velocity, γ; and the time of primary minimum,
T0. The radial velocities for the system were taken from McClure (1983).

3 SYNTHETIC PHOTOMETRY

The entire and individual synthetic magnitudes are calculated by integrating the model ﬂuxes over
each bandpass of the system calibrated to the reference star (Vega) using the following equation Ma´ız
Apell´aniz (2007); Al-Wardat (2012):

mp[Fλ,s(λ)] = −2.5 log R Pp(λ)Fλ,s(λ)λdλ
R Pp(λ)Fλ,r(λ)λdλ

+ ZPp ,

(10)

where mp is the synthetic magnitude of the passband p, Pp(λ) is the dimensionless sensitivity function
of the passband p, Fλ,s(λ) is the synthetic SED of the object and Fλ,r(λ) is the SED of Vega. Zero
points (ZPp) from Ma´ız Apell´aniz (2007) (and references there in) were adopted.

The results of the calculated magnitudes and color indices (Johnson: U , B, V , R, U − B, B − V ,
V − R; Str¨omgren: u, v, b, y, u − v, v − b, b − y and Tycho: BT , VT , BT − VT ) of the entire system
and individual components, in different photometrical systems, are shown in Table 7.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 8 shows a high consistency between the synthetic magnitudes and colors and the observational
ones. This gives a good indication about the reliability of the estimated parameters listed in Table 4.
Also, the resulted magnitude difference, individual magnitudes and absolute magnitudes (Tables 4& 7)
are consistent with the calculated ones as preliminary input parameters.

The positions of the system’s components on the evolutionary tracks of Girardi et al. (2000a) (Fig. 4)
show that both components, of mass between 0.8 and 0.9M⊙ for each of them, belong to the main-
sequence stars, but both show a slight displacement from the zero-age main-sequence upwards. And
their positions on Girardi et al. (2000a) isochrones for low- and intermediate-mass stars of different
metallicities and that of the solar composition [Z = 0.019, Y = 0.273] are shown in Figs 5 & 6, which
give an age of the system around 9 ± 1 Gy.

Spectroscopic orbital solution for Gliese 762.1 in Table 5 and radial velocities.
Triangles represent radial velocities of the primary and squares represent radial velocities of
the secondary component. The dotted line in the ﬁgure represents the center of mass velocity
( Vγ=11.31 ± 0.12 kms−1).

The spectral types and luminosity classes of both components are assigned as K0V and K1.5V for
the primary and secondary components respectively, and their positions on the evolutionary tracks are
showed in Fig. 4, which are brighter than those given by Farrington et al. (2010) as K2V and K4V.

The estimated orbital elements of the system (Tables 5 & 6) are consistent with previous works. The
orbit of the system was solved using a combination of the relative position measurements and the radial
velocity curves, which gives more reliable and accurate results.

The mass sum of the system components and the individual masses were calculated and es-
timated in three different ways; using the physical parameters and standard relations as Ma =
0.89 ± 0.08M⊙, Mb = 0.83 ± 0.07M⊙, using the orbital elements with Hipparcos parallax as

tionary tracks of Girardi et al. (2000a) (Fig. 4) which coincide with the calculated ones.

Depending on the estimated parameters of the system’s components and their positions on the evo-
lutionary tracks, fragmentation is a possible process for the formation of the system. Where Bonnell
(1994) concludes that fragmentation of a rotating disk around an incipient central protostar is possible,
as long as there is continuing infall. Zinnecker & Mathieu (2001) pointed out that hierarchical fragmen-
tation during rotational collapse has been invoked to produce binaries and multiple systems.

It is worthwhile to mention here that the system Gliese 762.1 is a detached one with an orbital
period of 1.3534 ± 0.0010yr. So, this system is a visually close but not a contact binary, and if we
compare it with other extremely K-type close binary systems like BI Vulpeculae (Qian et al. 2013),
AD Cancri (Qian et al. 2007) and PY Virginis (Zhu et al. 2013), which have shorter orbital periods
( days) and lower angular momentum among K-type binary stars, we ﬁnd that the orbital evolution of

† See Table 1

such systems are affected by the existence of a third component by removing angular momentum from
the central binary system during the early stellar formation process or/and later dynamical interactions.
However, as for Gliese 762.1, such dynamical interactions may not exist. It may form directly from
stellar formation process because the orbital separation between the two components is much larger.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We present the results of the complex analysis of the double-lined spectroscopic binary system Gliese
762.1. We were able to achieve the best ﬁt between the entire synthetic SED’s and the observational one
(Fig. 1) by producing and calibrating synthetic SED of the individual components in an iterated method.
The orbit of the system and its radial velocities were also solved to estimate reliable orbital elements
consistent with the physical ones of atmospheres modeling.

We relayed on Hipparcos parallax (58.96 ± 0.65 mas, d = 16.96 pc van Leeuwen (2007)) for the
calculations of the entire SED and the masses of the system. The Hipparcos parallax was not that far
from the dynamical parallaxes introduced in previous orbital solutions (see Table 6).
