1. Introduction:

The study of ﬁxed points of mappings satisfying certain contractive condi-
tions has been very active area of research. Recently Long-Guang and Xian [9]
generalised the concept of a metric space, by introducing cone metric spaces, and
obtained some ﬁxed point theorem for mappings satisfying certain contractive
conditions. One can consider a generalisation of a cone metric space by replacing
the triangle inequality by a more general inequality. As such, every cone metric
is a generalised cone metric space but the converse is not true. However the
interesting point to note that two very important ﬁxed point theorems, namely
Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem and Ciric’s ﬁxed point theorem have already es-
tablised in such a space. In this paper we continue in this direction and prove a
ﬁxed point theorem of Boyed and Wang [2], [5] under fairly general conditions
in a generalised cone metric spaces.

2. Main Results

Let E be a real Banach space. A nonempty convex closed subset P ⊂ E is

called a cone in E if it satisﬁes:
(i) P is closed, nonempty and P 6= {0},
(ii) a, b ∈ R, a, b ≥ 0 and x, y ∈ P imply that ax + by ∈ P ,
(iii) x ∈ P and − x ∈ P imply that x = 0.
The space E can be partially ordered by the cone P ⊂ E; i. e. x ≤ y if and only
if y − x ∈ P . Also we write x << y if y − x ∈ int P , where int P denotes the
interior of P .
A cone P is called normal if there exists a constant K > 0 such that 0 ≤ x ≤ y
implies k x k≤ K k y k.
In the following we always suppose that E is a real Banach space, P is a cone
in E and ≤ is partial ordering with respect to P .

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let X be a nonempty set and let E be a Banach space with
cone P and d : X 2 → E be a mapping such that for all x, y ∈ X and for any
k (k ≥ 2) distinct points z1, z2, ......, zk in X each of them diﬀerent from x and
y, one has
1.θ ≤ d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X, and d(x, y) = θ if and only if x = y.
2.d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X
3.d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z1) + d(z1, z2) + ..... + d(zk, y) for all x, y, z1, z2, ......, zk in X.
i.e. {d(x, z1) + d(z1, z2) + ..... + d(zk, y) − d(x, y)} ∈ P
Then we say (X, d) is a generalised cone metric space (or shortly g.c.m.s.).

Throughout this section a g.c.m.s. will be denoted by (X, d) (or sometimes

by X only) and N denote the set of all naturals.
Any cone metric space is a g.c.m.s. but the converse is not true [1]. We ﬁrst
recall some basic deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A sequence {xn}n∈N ∈ X is said to be a g.c.m.s. convergent
if for every ε in E with θ < ε, there is an N ∈ N such that for all n > N ,
ε − d(xn, x) ∈ P for some ﬁxed x ∈ X.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A sequence {xn}n∈N ∈ X, is said to be a g.c.m.s. Cauchy
sequence if for every ε ∈ E with θ < ε, there is an N ∈ N such that for all
m, n > N , ε − d(xn, xm) ∈ P .

We say that a g.c.m.s is complete if every Cauchy sequence in X is convergent

in X.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A mapping T : X → X is said to be contractive if for any two
points x, y ∈ X, d(x, y) − d(T x, T y) ∈ P .

Deﬁnition 2.5. A function f : E → P is said to be upper semicontinuous at
x0 ∈ E if there exists a neighbourhood U of x0 such that f (x)+ǫ ∈ P, for all x ∈
U .

We now prove the following ﬁxed point theorem for Boyd and Wong’s con-

tractive mappings [2], [5].

Theorem 2.1. Let X be a complete g.c.m.s. and let T : X → X satisﬁes

ψ(d(x, y)) − d(T x, T y) ∈ P,

(1)
where ψ : ¯P → E is upper semicontinuous from right on ¯P (the closure of the
range d) and satisﬁes ψ(t) < t f or all t ∈ ¯P − {0}. Then T has a unique ﬁxed
point x0 and T nx → x0 f or all x ∈ X.

Proof. Given x ∈ X, deﬁne

cn = d(T nx, T n−1x).

(2)

since d(T x, T y) ≤ ψ(d(x, y)) < d(x, y), the sequence {cn}n∈N ie decreasing.
Suppose cn → c ∈ E. Then if c > 0, we have ψ(cn) − cn + 1 ∈ P . Then
lim sup
i.e. ψ(t) − c ∈ P which is a contradiction. Therefore

ψ(t) − c ∈ P .

t→c+
cn → 0.

For each x ∈ X, consider the sequence {T nx}. First assume that it is eventu-
ally constant. So there is some n ∈ N such that T mx = T nx = y for each m > n.

Then T m−n(T nx) = T nx, so denoting k = m− n, we have T ky = y for all k ∈
N. It follows that d(y, T y) = d(T ky, T k+1y) = ck for all k, and since ck → 0,
d(y, T y) = 0, so y = T y. Then y is a ﬁxed point of T.

If {T nx} is not eventually constant, then it has a subsequence with pairwise
distinct terms. Without loss of generality, assume that {T nx} is this subse-
quence. We shall show that {T nx} is a g.c.m.s. Cauchy sequence. By contradic-
tion suppose that there is an ε > 0 and sequences {mk}, {nk} of positive integers
with k ≤ nk < mk such that

ε − d(T mk x, T nk x) /∈ P for all k ∈ N.

(3)

Since this is true for all k ∈ N, we can conclude that for all k ∈ N, there will

exist nk ≥ k and an inﬁnite number of mk > nk for which

ε
3

− d(T mk x, T nk x) ∈ P.

(4)

For otherwise let m1 > n(K) be the highest positive integer for which (4)

holds. Since ck → 0 as k → ∞ we can ﬁnd m2 ∈ N such that

ck =

ε
3

− d(T kx, T k−1x) ∈ P for all k ≥ m2.

Now if m0 = max(m1, m2) then for any i, j > m0
3 −d(T ix, T i+1x) ∈ P ⇒ ε

3 − d(T ix, T i+1x) ∈ P ; ε

P ⇒ ε
3 − d(T i+1x, T nx) ∈ P ; ε
ε − d(T ix, , T jx) ∈ P if j > i + 1, which contradicts (3).

3 −d(T ix, T jx) ∈ P , if j = i+1 ⇒ ε−d(T ix, T jx) ∈
3 − d(T nx, T jx) ∈ P ⇒

Now in the view of (4) we can choose mk as the least positive integer greater

than nk + 2 for which

d/3 =

ε
3

− d(T mk x, T nkx) ∈ P for all k ∈ N.

(6)

Assume that k ≥ m2. Now if
(i) m ≥ n+5 then clearly, cm−d(T mx, T m+1x) ∈ P ; cm−1−d(T m−1x, T m−2x) ∈
3 − d(T m−1, T nx) ∈ P . This implies (cm + cm−1 + ε

3 − d(T mx, T nx) ∈

P ; ε
P i.e. (2ck + ε

3 − d(T mx, T nx) ∈ P .

Choose dk = (2ck + ε
(ii) If m = n + 3 then by (5)
ε
3 −d(T m−2x, T nx) ∈ P , so ck−d(T mx, T m−1x) ∈ P ; ck−d(T m−1x, T m−2x) ∈

3 − d(T mx, T nx) ∈ P .

P and ε

3 − d(T m−2x, T nx) ∈ P

implies (2ck + ε/3) − d(T mx, T nx) = dk ∈ P .
(iii) If m = n + 4 then ck − d(T nx, T n+1x) ∈ P ; ck − d(T n+1x, T n+2x) ∈ P ;
3 ) −

3 − d(T n+3x, T n+4x) ∈ P . This implies (3ck + ε

ck − d(T n+2x, T n+3x) ∈ P ; ε
d(T mx, T nx) = dk ∈ P .

3 − dk ∈ P as k → ∞.

Hence ε
Again, ck − d(T mx, T m+1x) ∈ P ; ck − d(T m+1x, T n+1x) ∈ P ; i.e.
ψ(d(T mx, T nx)) − d(T n+1x, T nx) ∈ P .
Hence ψ(dk) − d(T n+1x, T nx) ∈ P . Which shows that

2ck + ψ(dk) − d(T mx, T nx) = dk ∈ P

(7)

Thus as k → ∞ from (7), we obtain ψ( ε
3 ∈ P ,
which contradicts the given condition since ε > 0.
Therefore in this case {T nx} is a g.c.m.s. Cauchy and as X is complete,

3 ) − ε

{T nx} converges to a point x0 in X.

We shall show that T x0 = x0. We divide the proof into two parts. First let

T nx be diﬀerent from both x0 and T x0 for any n ∈ N. Then

d(T x0, T nx) + d(T nx, T n+1x) + d(T n+1x, T x0) − d(x0, T x0) ∈ P
i.e. d(x0, T nx) + cn+1 + ψ(d(x0, T nx0)) − d(x0, T x0) ∈ P
hence d(x0, T x0) + cn+1 + d(x0, T nx0) − d(x0, T x0) ∈ P . Which gives
ε − d(x0, T x0) ∈ P for any ε > 0 and as n → ∞.
Which implies T x0 = x0.
Next assume that T kx = x0 or T kx = T x0 for some k ∈ N.
Obviously then x0 6= x and one can easily show that {T nx0} is a sequence

with the following properties.

d(T nx0, x0) ∈ P .

(i) ε − lim
n→∞
(ii) x0 − T nx0 /∈ P for any n ∈ N.
(iii) T rx0 − T px0 /∈ P for any p, r ∈ N, p 6= r.
Hence proceeding the above it immediately follows that x0 is a ﬁxed point of

T .

That the ﬁxed point of T is unique easily follows from the deﬁnition of T .
