EFFECTIVE CONES OF CYCLES

ON BLOW-UPS OF PROJECTIVE SPACE

IZZET COSKUN, JOHN LESIEUTRE, AND JOHN CHRISTIAN OTTEM

Abstract. In this paper, we study the cones of higher codimension (pseudo)eﬀective cycles
on point blow-ups of projective space. We determine bounds on the number of points for
which these cones are generated by the classes of linear cycles, and for which these cones
are ﬁnitely generated. Surprisingly, we discover that for (very) general points, the higher
codimension cones behave better than the cones of divisors. For example, for the blow-up
r of Pn, n > 4, at r very general points, the cone of divisors is not ﬁnitely generated as
X n
soon as r > n + 3, whereas the cone of curves is generated by the classes of lines if r ≤ 2n.
In fact, if X n
r are ﬁnitely
generated.

1. Introduction

In recent years, the theory of cones of cycles of higher codimension has been the subject
of increasing attention [CC], [DELV], [DJV], [FL1], [FL2]. However, these cones have been
computed only for a very small number of examples, mainly because the current theory is
hard to apply in practice. The goal of this paper is to provide some much-needed examples.
Γ denote the blow-up of Pn along Γ.
Let Γ be a set of r distinct points on Pn. Let X n
Γ by X n
When Γ is a set of r very general points, we denote X n
r . For a smooth variety Y , we
write Eﬀ k(Y ) for the pseudoeﬀective cone of codimension-k cycles on Y , and Eﬀ k(Y ) for the
pseudoeﬀective cone of dimension-k cycles. In this paper, we study the cones Eﬀ k(X n
Γ ) when
the points of Γ are either in linearly general or very general position. We also investigate
the cones when Γ contains points in certain special conﬁgurations.

Cones of positive divisors on X n

Γ provide an important source of examples in the study of
positivity. These cones are particularly attractive since they have concrete interpretations in
terms of subvarieties of projective space, yet still have very complicated structure. However,
even the cones of divisors on blow-ups of P2 at 10 or more points are far from well-understood,
and several basic questions remain open, including the Nagata [N] and Segre–Harbourne–
Gimigliano–Hirschowitz (SHGH) conjectures [G], [Har], [Hi]. We expect the cones of higher
codimension cycles on X n

Γ to be an equally rich source of examples.

Surprisingly, these cones are simpler than one might expect. Eﬀective cones of low-
dimensional cycles are generated by the classes of linear spaces for r well into the range
for which X n
r ) is generated by

n ≥ 5. We now describe our results in greater detail.

r ) is not ﬁnitely generated for r ≥ n + 4 when

Deﬁnition 1. We say that Eﬀ k(X n
Γ ) is linearly generated if it is the cone spanned by the
classes of k-dimensional linear spaces in the exceptional divisors and the strict transforms
of k-dimensional linear subspaces of Pn, possibly passing through the points of Γ. We say
Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) is ﬁnitely generated if it is a rational polyhedral cone.

Theorem (3.1). Let Γ be a set of r points in Pn in linearly general position.

If r ≤

max(cid:0)n + 2, n + n

k(cid:1), then Eﬀ k(X n

Γ) is linearly generated.

There exist conﬁgurations of 2n + 2 − k points in linearly general position in Pn for which
Eﬀ k(X n
Γ ) is not linearly generated (see Example 3.1). In particular, Theorem 3.1 is sharp
for 1-cycles. We expect that this bound can be improved to r ≤ 2n + 1 − k, and prove this
in the case that Γ is a very general conﬁguration of points (Theorem 4.3). We obtain the
following consequence.

Corollary (4.5). If X n

r is a Mori Dream Space, then Eﬀ k(X n

r ) is ﬁnitely generated.

In general, Mori Dream Spaces may have eﬀective cones of intermediate dimensional cycles
which are not ﬁnitely generated; the corollary shows that this does not happen for blow-ups
of Pn. A good example is [DELV, Example 6.10] attributed to Tschinkel. Let Xb be the
blow-up of P4 along a smooth quartic K3 surface Yb ⊂ P3 ⊂ P4. Then Xb is Fano, hence, by
[BCHM], a Mori Dream Space. On the other hand, Eﬀ 2(Xb) has inﬁnitely many extremal
rays when Eﬀ 1(Yb) does. Quartic K3 surfaces may have inﬁnitely many (−2)-curves or even a
round cone of curves. This example also shows that the property of having ﬁnitely generated
higher codimension cones can fail countably many times in a family.

The bounds can be exponentially improved (at least for 1-cycles) if we assume that Γ is a

set of very general points.

Proposition (4.1). The cone Eﬀ 1(X n

r ) is linearly generated if and only if r ≤ 2n.

As a consequence of Proposition 4.1, we conclude that Eﬀ k(X n

r ) is not linearly generated
if r ≥ 2n−k+1 + k (Corollary 4.2). This specializes to the fact that the cone of divisors of X n
r
is not linearly generated as soon as r > n + 2 (see Theorem 2.5).

Work of Mukai [Mu] shows that the cone of divisors of X n
r

is not ﬁnitely generated if
r ≥ n + 4 and n ≥ 5 (one needs r ≥ 8 for n = 2, 4 and r ≥ 7 for n = 3). Mukai
explicitly constructs inﬁnitely many extremal divisors on Eﬀ 1(X n
r ), as the orbit of one of
the exceptional divisors under the action of Cremona transformations. However, in higher
codimensions it is more diﬃcult to prove that the corresponding cones become inﬁnite.

Many questions about cones of higher codimension cycles appear to be intractable, quickly
reducing to diﬃcult questions about cones of divisors. For example, the interesting part of
the cone of curves of P3 blown up at 9 points is given by curves lying on the unique quadric
Q through the 9 points. The blow-up of Q is isomorphic to the blow-up of P2 at 10 points,
and the curves which are extremal on X 3
9 are certain KQ-positive ones contained in Q. Hence
understanding Eﬀ 1(X 3
10), running
immediately into the SHGH conjecture (see Conjecture 1). We are able to show this non-
ﬁniteness only for cones of codimension-2 cycles, and then assuming the SHGH conjecture
on the cone of curves of P2 blown up at 10 points.

Corollary (5.5). Assume the SHGH conjecture holds for blow-ups of P2 at 10 points. Then
Eﬀ 2(X n

r ) is not ﬁnitely generated if r ≥ n + 6 and n ≥ 3.

Finally, in the last section, we compute Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) when Γ is a set of points in certain
special positions. Using these computations, we show that linear and ﬁnite generation of
Eﬀ k(X n
Γ ) are neither open nor closed in families (see Corollary 6.5 and Corollary 6.6). This
generalizes analogous jumping behavior exhibited for divisors and Mori Dream Spaces to all
codimensions.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we recall basic facts about the cohomology of X n

Γ and cones of codimension-

1 cycles. We will work over the complex numbers C.

The cohomology of X n

Γ . Let Γ be a set of r points p1, . . . , pr in Pn, and let

π : X n

Γ = BlΓ Pn → Pn

denote the blow-up of Pn along Γ. Let H denote the pullback of the hyperplane class
and let Ei denote the class of the exceptional divisor over pi. The exceptional divisor Ei
is isomorphic to Pn−1 and OEi(Ei) ∼= OPn−1(−1). Consequently, we have the following
intersection formulas:

H n = (−1)n−1En

i = 1, H · Ei = 0, Ei · Ej = 0,

i 6= j.

Notation 2.1. In order to simplify notation, we make the convention that Hk is the class
of a k-dimensional linear space in Pn and Ei,k is the class of a k-dimensional linear space
contained in the exceptional divisor Ei. We then have the relations

H n−k = Hk,

(−1)n−k+1En−k

i = Ei,k, Ei · Ei,k = −Ei,k−1.

A set of points in Pn is said to be linearly general if no k +2 points are contained in a linear
subspace Pk ⊂ Pn for 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. A claim holds for a very general conﬁguration of points
if it holds for all points in the complement of a countable union of proper conﬁgurations of
points.
Convention 2.1. It is occasionally useful to compare the cones Eﬀ k(X n
∆ ),
∆ are the blow-ups of Pn and Pm along sets of points Γ and ∆, respectively.
where X n
If n > k, we can identify Nk(X n
Γ) with the abstract vector space spanned by Hk and Ei,k for
1 ≤ i ≤ r, irrespective of n and Γ provided that Γ has cardinality r. We can thus view the
cones Eﬀ k(X n
Γ) as cones in the same abstract vector space and compare the eﬀective cones
of diﬀerent blow-ups after this identiﬁcation. In the rest of the paper, we will do so without
further comment.

Γ ) and Eﬀ k(X m

Γ and X m

We will often use the following easy lemma implicitly.

Lemma 2.1. Let Y ⊂ X n

Γ be a k-dimensional subvariety.

(1) If Y ⊂ Ei for some 1 ≤ i ≤ r, then [Y ] = biEi,k for bi > 0.

i=1 biEi,k with a ≥ bi ≥ 0. The coeﬃcient bi is equal to the

(2) Otherwise, [Y ] = aHk −Pr

multiplicity of π(Y ) in Pn at the point pi.
∼= Pn−1. Hence, its class is a positive
Proof. If Y ⊂ Ei, then Y is a subvariety of Ei
multiple of the class of a k-dimensional linear space. The linear system H − Ei deﬁnes the
projection from the point pi and is a base-point-free linear system. Hence, the intersection
of k general members of H − Ei with Y is either empty or ﬁnitely many points. Therefore,
(H − Ei)k · [Y ] = a − bi ≥ 0. Similarly, the intersection Y ∩ Ei is a (possibly empty) eﬀective
cycle of dimension k − 1 contained in Ei. Hence, by the ﬁrst part of the lemma, bi ≥ 0. That
bi in fact coincides with the multiplicity is [Fu, Cor. 6.7.1].
(cid:3)

The cones Eﬀ k(X n

Γ) satisfy a basic semicontinuity property under specialization.

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that V ⊂ Pn ×T is a closed subvariety, ﬂat over T , and let p : T → Pn
be a section. Then multp(t)(Vt) is an upper semicontinuous function of T .
Proof. It suﬃces to prove this in the case that T has dimension 1. Let π : Y → Pn × T be
the blow-up along p(T ), with exceptional divisor E, and let ˜V be the strict transform of V
on Y . Since ˜V is irreducible and dominates T , this family is ﬂat. The intersection of a ﬂat
family of cycles with a Cartier divisor is constant in t [Fu, Prop. 10.2.1], and so (−1)kEk · Vt
is independent of t.

The general ﬁber ˜Vt is irreducible, but a special ﬁber ˜V0 may have additional components in

0 is a hyperplane in E0, and so (−1)kEk

the exceptional divisor E0. Write ˜V0 = V 0S ∪iWi, where the Wi are contained in E0. Then

(−1)kEk ·V 0 = multp(0) V . The class (−1)kEk
0 ·Wi ≥ 0.
This shows that multp(0) V0 ≥ (−1)kEk · ˜Vt = multp(t) Vt, and so the multiplicity is upper
semicontinuous.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.3. Let Γ be a conﬁguration of r distinct points on Pn. Then Eﬀ k(X n
Eﬀ k(X n
Proof. Let Γt be a very general one-parameter family of conﬁgurations of points in Pn with
Γ0 = Γ.
If a k-cycle class W is eﬀective for very general T , then by a Hilbert scheme
Pn over T with [Vt] = W for general T . Since
argument there exists a ﬂat family Vt ⊂ BlΓt
the multiplicity of Wt can only increase at t = 0 by Lemma 2.2, the class W is also eﬀective
on XΓ.

Cones. Taking cones will be a useful method to generate interesting cycles. Let Γ′ be a
very general conﬁguration of r + 1 points p′0, . . . , p′r in Pn+1. The projection of the points
p′1, . . . , p′r from p′0 is then a set Γ of r very general points p1, . . . , pr in Pn. Suppose that V
is a k-cycle on X n
i=1 biEi,k. The image of V in Pn has degree a and
multiplicity bi at the points of Γ. We may form the cone CV over V inside Pn+1 with vertex
at p′0. This is a (k + 1)-dimensional variety, of degree a. It has multiplicity a at the cone
point, and multiplicity bi along the lines spanned by pi and p′i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. In particular,
the cycle CV has degree a, and multiplicities a, b1, . . . , br at the points of Γ′.
Its proper

tions of the given vectors. We now proceed by induction on a. The case a = 1 is clear: since
by (2) a ≥ bi for each i, each bi is either 0 or 1. By (3) there are at most n nonzero bi, and
the vector is of the form claimed.

Suppose that a > 1. Let j be the minimum of n and the number of nonzero bi, and let J
the the set of indices of j nonzero bi. Then the vector hJ is a nonnegative linear combination
of the given vectors. Set v′ = (a′, b′i) = v − hJ . If j ≥ n, v′ still satisﬁes all of the inequalities

This completes the proof by induction on a.

Lemma 2.4 implies that the cone Eﬀ k(X n

The codimension-1 cones and Cremona actions. We are primarily interested in the
question of when the cones of cycles on X n

[Mu].

The characterization of cases when the eﬀective cone of divisors is ﬁnitely generated is
based on the study of the action of Cremona transformations on the pseudoeﬀective cone.
The Coxeter group W corresponding to a T -shaped Dynkin diagram of type T2,n+1,r−n−1

r−n−1 < 1, which happens as soon as n ≥ 5 and r ≥ n + 4. (When n = 2 or
4, we need r ≥ 9, while when n = 3, we require r ≥ 8). The orbit of a single exceptional
divisor class gives an inﬁnite set divisors spanning other extremal rays. For details on this
group action, we refer to [Do] (see also [Co]).

2 + 1

Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a simple way to use the Cremona action to
understand cones of cycles of higher codimension. The standard Cremona involution acts on
X n
r by a map with codimension 2 indeterminacy, so it does not deﬁne an action preserving
the cone Eﬀ k(X n
r ) for any k > 1. For example, suppose that L is a line through two blown
up points. The class of L deﬁnes an extremal ray on Eﬀ 1(X n
r ). The strict transform of L
under a Cremona transformation centered at n + 1 other points is a rational normal curve
in Pn passing through n + 3 points. If n ≥ 3, this is no longer an extremal ray on Eﬀ 1(X n
r ),
since it is in the interior of the subcone generated by classes of lines through 2 of the n + 3
points.

One might attempt to construct interesting codimension-2 cycles on X r

n by taking the
intersections of a ﬁxed divisor with an inﬁnite sequence of (−1)-divisors (i.e. divisors in the
orbit of Ei under the action of W ) of increasing degree. However, the next lemma shows
that the intersection of a (−1)-divisor with any other eﬀective divisor on X n
r is in the span
of the classes of codimension-2 linear cycles.

Lemma 2.6. Suppose that D1 is a (−1)-divisor and that D2 is an irreducible eﬀective divisor
distinct from D1. Then [D1 ∩ D2] is in the span of linear codimension-2 cycles.

Proof. Consider the pairing on N 1(X n
and (Ei, Ej) = 0 if i 6= j. This pairing is invariant under the action of W on N 1(X n
[Do].

r ) deﬁned by (H, H) = n−1, (H, Ei) = 0, (Ei, Ei) = −1,
r ) [Mu],

We ﬁrst show that (D1, D2) ≥ 0. Since the pairing (,) is invariant under the action of W on
N 1(X n
r ), we may apply a suitable element of W and assume that D1 = E1 is an exceptional
divisor. If D2 = Ej is an exceptional divisor diﬀerent from E1, then (D1, D2) = 0. Otherwise,

By Lemma 2.4, this means that the codimension-2 cycle [D1 ∩ D2] = acH −Pr

contained in the span of linear cycles.

Easy Lemmas. Here we collect a couple of geometric lemmas that we will use repeatedly.

Lemma 2.7. Suppose that E is an eﬀective divisor and that P is a nef divisor. If Y is an
irreducible, eﬀective variety of dimension k which is not contained in E, then P k−1·E ·Y ≥ 0.

Proof. The intersection E · Y is a (possibly empty) cycle of dimension k − 1 by assumption.
Since P is nef, it follows that P k−1 · E · Y ≥ 0.

Γ be an irreducible variety of dimension k, not contained in any
i=1 biEi,k. If bi + bj > a for two indices i 6= j, then

Proof. The base locus of the linear system |H − Ei − Ej| is the line li,j spanned by pi and
pj. Consequently, the intersection (H − Ei − Ej)k−1 · Y is an eﬀective 1-cycle Z. Express

where u is a 1-cycle not containing li,j. Since

Z = αli,j + u,

−α ≤ (H − Ei − Ej) · Z = a − bi − bj < 0,

we conclude that α ≥ bi + bj − a. Hence, Y must have multiplicity at least bi + bj − a at
every point of li,j.

3. Points in linearly general position

In this section, we study Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) when the cardinality of Γ is small and the points of Γ

are in linearly general position. Our main theorem is the following.

then Eﬀ k(X n

The proof will be by induction on k and n. We ﬁrst single out the case k = 1.

Lemma 3.2. Let Γ be a set of r ≤ 2n points in Pn in linearly general position. Then
Eﬀ 1(X n

Γ) is linearly generated.

Proof. Let B be an irreducible curve. By Lemma 2.1, we may assume that B is not contained
i=1 biEi,1 with a ≥ bi ≥ 0. Any r ≤ 2n
points in linearly general position are cut out by quadrics [H, Lecture 1]. Consequently, there

B. Hence, B has nonnegative intersection with Q and satisﬁes 2a ≥ Pr

2.4, the class of B is spanned by the classes of lines.

i=1 Ei in X n

Next, we study the case when r ≤ n + 1. In this case, X n

Γ is toric and the eﬀective cones
are generated by torus-invariant cycles (see e.g. [Li, Prop. 3.1]). For the reader’s convenience
we will give a simple independent proof.

Lemma 3.3. Let Γ be a set of r ≤ n + 1 linearly general points in Pn. The cone Eﬀ k(X n
Γ)
is linearly generated for any k.

Proof. Let Γ′ ⊂ Γ be two sets with cardinality r and n + 1, respectively. Then the proper
transform of any eﬀective cycle in X n
Γ) is
linearly generated, then Eﬀ k(X n
Γ′) is also linearly generated. Hence, without loss of generality,
we may assume that r = n + 1. Let Y be an irreducible k-dimensional variety in X n

By Lemma 2.1, we may assume that Y is not contained in an exceptional divisor and that
a ≥ bi ≥ 0. We proceed by induction on k and n. Up to reordering the points, we may
assume b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn+1. Let L be the proper transform of the Pn−1 spanned by the
ﬁrst n points. First, suppose Y is contained in L. Since L is isomorphic to the blow-up of
Pn−1 in n points, by induction on n with base case Theorem 2.5, we conclude that the class
of Y is in the span of linear spaces. Otherwise, Y ∩ L is an eﬀective cycle of dimension k − 1
in L. Write HL,k−1 and EL,i,k−1 for the restriction of Hk to L and the (k − 1)-dimensional
linear space in the exceptional divisor EL,i of the blow-up of L at pi. Then we have

and we need to settle the case r = n + 2. There is a rational normal curve through any n + 3

divisor D, there exists a rational normal curve C containing the points but not contained
i=1 bi. We recover the
linear generation result of Theorem 2.5. By Lemma 3.2, the curve classes are also linearly
generated. By induction assume that for all m < n and all k < m, the eﬀective cone of k
cycles of the blow-up of Pm in m + 2 linearly general points is linearly generated. We carry
out the inductive step for Pn. Let Y, L be as above. By Lemma 3.3, we may assume that
Y is not contained in L. If bn+1 + bn+2 ≤ a, then we already proved that the class of Y
is linearly generated. If bn+1 + bn+2 > a, then, by Lemma 2.8, Y contains the line ln+1,n+2
spanned by pn+1 and pn+2 with multiplicity at least bn+1 + bn+2 − a. Let p0 denote the point
of intersection L ∩ ln+1,n+2. Then the proper transform of L ∩ Y is an eﬀective cycle in the

By Lemma 2.4, the class of Y is linearly generated. This concludes the proof.

Example 3.1. Lemma 3.2 is sharp in the sense that there exist sets Γ of r > 2n points in
general linear position such that Eﬀ 1(X n

we will see that we can improve the bounds for linear generation exponentially if instead of
assuming that Γ is linearly general, we assume Γ is a set of very general points in Pn.

More generally, let Y be the cone over a rational normal curve of degree n − k + 1 with
vertex V a Pk−2. Let Γ be the union of a set of k − 1 general points p1, . . . , pk−1 in V and
a set of r − k + 1 general points pk, . . . , pr on Y . Then Γ is in general linear position. The

In view of Proposition 3.4, it is natural to ask whether the bound in Theorem 3.1 can be

improved to r ≤ 2n − k + 1.

Question 3.1. Assume that Γ is a set of r linearly general points in Pn such that

k(cid:17) < r ≤ 2n − k + 1.

The answer is aﬃrmative for curves and divisors. We will shortly check that for 2-cycles
in P4 the answer is also aﬃrmative. In Theorem 4.3 we will see that that the answer is also
aﬃrmative if the points are very general. In view of this evidence, we expect the answer to
Question 3.1 to be aﬃrmative.
Remark 3.1. The dimension of the space Sn−k,k+1(Pn) of scrolls of dimension n−k and degree
k + 1 in Pn is

2n + 2nk − k2 − 2

[C1, Lemma 2.4]. There are scrolls in Sn−k,k+1(Pn) passing through 2n−k +2 points (see [C2]
for the surface case). Hence, the family of scrolls passing through 2n − k + 1 points covers
Pn. By Lemma 2.4, an aﬃrmative answer to Question 3.1 is equivalent to the statement
that every eﬀective k-dimensional cycle intersects the proper transform of a scroll passing
through the 2n − k + 1 points non-negatively.

Question 3.2. Let Γ be 2n − k + 1 linearly general points in Pn. For every eﬀective k-cycle
Y in X n
Γ , does there exist a scroll S of dimension n − k and degree k + 1 such that the proper
transform S in X n

Γ intersects Y in ﬁnitely many points?

By Remark 3.1, an aﬃrmative answer to Question 3.2 implies an aﬃrmative answer to

Question 3.1.

Eﬀective 2-cycles on the blow-up of P4 at 7 points. We now verify that the answer to
Question 3.1 is aﬃrmative for two-cycles in P4. The argument is subtle because we need to
verify linear generation for every conﬁguration of 7 points in linear general position, rather
than just very general conﬁgurations of points.

Theorem 3.5. Let Γ be 7 linearly general points on P4. Then the cone Eﬀ 2(X 4

Lemma 2.4 implies that [Y ] is in the span of the classes of planes.

We are reduced to showing that if Y ⊂ Sec(R), then [Y ] is in the span of the classes of
planes. Let S3 denote the space of cubic surface scrolls containing the points of Γ. We will
show the following.

Theorem 3.6. The proper transform S of a general member S ∈ S3 intersects Sec(R) in an
irreducible curve B whose projection to Sec(R) is a degree 9 curve double at the points of Γ.
Furthermore, the curve B can be made to pass through a general point of Sec(R).

Assume Theorem 3.6. Let p ∈ Sec(R) be a general point not contained in Y . Hence, an
irreducible curve B passing through p intersects Y in ﬁnitely many points. Let S be the
proper transform of a scroll S ∈ S3 containing p and intersecting Sec(R) in an irreducible
curve. We conclude that S and Y intersect in ﬁnitely many points, hence their intersection
number is positive. Therefore,

By Lemma 2.4, we conclude that [Y ] is in the span of the classes of planes.

There remains to prove Theorem 3.6, which we will do via a series of claims. We ﬁrst set

some notation.

Notation 3.1. Let li,j denote the line spanned by pi, pj ∈ Γ and let Πi1,...,il denote the linear
space spanned by pi1, . . . , pil ∈ Γ. Let Γi1,...,il denote the set of points pi1, . . . , pil. Let l be
the line of intersection Π1,2,3,4 ∩ Π5,6,7 and, for 5 ≤ i < j ≤ 7, let zi,j denote the point of
intersection Π1,2,3,4 ∩ li,j. Since the points are in linearly general position, the line l does not
intersect the lines li,j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4 and intersects the planes Πi,j,k, for 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ 4,
in a unique point diﬀerent from zi,j.

Next, we recall a compactiﬁcation S 3 of S3. Every irreducible cubic scroll induces a degree
3 rational curve in the Grassmannian G(1, 4) of lines in P4. We can compactify the space
of degree 3 rational curves in G(1, 4) via the Kontsevich moduli space. Hence, we can take
the closure of S3 in the Kontsevich moduli space (see [C2, §3] for details). More precisely,
let M0,7(G(1, 4), 3) denote the Kontsevich moduli space of 7-pointed genus-0 maps of degree
3 to G(1, 4). It is equipped with 7 evaluation morphisms evi : M0,7(G(1, 4), 3) → G(1, 4),

Claim 3.7. The space S 3 is irreducible of dimension 4.

i=1 ev−1

Proof. The locus T = ∩4
i (pi) in the Kontsevich moduli space M0,4(P3, 3) of 4-pointed
genus 0 maps of degree 3 to P3 provides a compactiﬁcation of the space of twisted cubic
curves in Π1,2,3,4 containing Γ1,2,3,4. Since M0,4(P3, 3) is irreducible of dimension 16, every
component of T has dimension at least 4.

If a twisted cubic T is irreducible, then any ﬁnite set of points on T is linearly general.
Furthermore, given 6 linearly general points in P3, there is a unique twisted cubic curve
containing them. Consider the incidence correspondence I = {(T, q1, q2)|q1, q2 ∈ T }, where
T is a twisted cubic curve containing the set of points Γ1,2,3,4 and q1, q2 are points such that

12

I. COSKUN, J. LESIEUTRE, AND J. C. OTTEM

Γ1,2,3,4∪{q1, q2} are in linearly general position. The incidence correspondence I is irreducible
of dimension 6 since it is isomorphic to an open subset of P3 × P3. It dominates the space
of twisted cubic curves containing p1, . . . , p4 via the ﬁrst projection. Since the ﬁbers of the
ﬁrst projection are two-dimensional, we conclude that the space of irreducible twisted cubics
containing Γ1,2,3,4 is irreducible of dimension 4.

Since there are no connected curves of degree two or one containing 4 points in linearly
general position in P3, any map in T is birational to its image. If there is a reducible curve
of degree 3 containing Γ1,2,3,4, either a degree two curve must contain 3 of the points or a line
must contain two of the points. In either case, it is easy to see that there is a 3-dimensional
family of reducible cubics containing Γ1,2,3,4. Hence, these cannot form a component of T
and T is irreducible.

Furthermore, 2 additional points q1, q2 impose independent conditions on twisted cubics
unless they are coplanar with three of the points in Γ1,2,3,4 or one of the points is collinear
with two of the points in Γ1,2,3,4. If q1 is collinear with p1, p2, then there is a 1-parameter
family of reducible cubics containing the line l1,2. Similarly, if q1 and q2 are in Π1,2,3 but no 4
of the points are collinear, then there is a 1-parameter family of reducible cubics containing
If q1, q2 are collinear with p1 and p2, there is a three-
the conic through Γ1,2,3 ∪ {q1, q2}.
parameter family of reducible cubics containing l1,2. Recall that l = Π1,2,3,4 ∩ Π5,6,7.
In
particular, the subset of T that parameterizes twisted cubics incident (respectively, secant)
to l has dimension 3 (respectively, 2) since any pair of distinct points impose independent
conditions on twisted cubics. Similarly, the locus of twisted cubics in T passing through z5,6
has dimension 2.

Since M0,7(G(1, 4), 3) is irreducible of dimension 25 [C2, §2], every irreducible component
of S has dimension at least 4. Let T be a twisted cubic curve containing Γ1,2,3,4 and not secant
to the line l and not containing the points z5,6, z5,7 and z6,7. Then there is a unique cubic
scroll S containing T and passing through p5, p6, p7 [C2, Example A1]. Brieﬂy, take a general
P3 containing Π5,6,7. This P3 intersects T in 3 points r1, r2, r3. There is a unique twisted
cubic curve T ′ containing r1, r2, r3 and Γ5,6,7. The curves T and T ′ are both isomorphic to P1
and there is a unique isomorphism φ taking ri ∈ T to ri ∈ T ′. Then the surface ST,T ′ swept
out by lines joining the points that correspond under φ is the unique cubic scroll containing
T and Γ5,6,7. If T contains the point z5,6 or is secant to the line l, then there is a 1-parameter
family of choices for T ′. Once we ﬁx T and T ′, the scroll is uniquely determined by a similar
construction. Since the locus of T containing z5,6 or secant to l has codimension 2, this locus
cannot form a component of S 3. Finally, reducible cubic surfaces containing Γ must contain
a plane through 3 of the points and a quadric surface through the remaining 4 points. There
is a 2-dimensional family of such surfaces and they do not give rise to a component in S 3
(see [C2]). We conclude that S 3 is irreducible of dimension 4.
(cid:3)

Claim 3.8. There exists a dense open set U ⊂ S 3 such that S 6⊂ Sec(R) for S ∈ U.
Furthermore, we may assume that S contains a general point of Sec(R).

Proof. It suﬃces to exhibit one S ∈ S 3 such that S 6⊂ Sec(R). Given 7 points in general
linear position and 2 general additional points, [C2, Example A1] shows that there are 2 cubic
scrolls containing these nine points. In particular, if we take one of the two additional points
outside Sec(R), we obtain a scroll not contained in Sec(R). Furthermore, a general twisted
cubic in Π1,2,3,4 containing Γ1,2,3,4 intersects Sec(R) in a another point q. Consequently, the
construction in the proof of Claim 3.7 exhibits a cubic scroll containing q and not contained

EFFECTIVE CYCLES ON BLOW-UPS OF Pn

13

in Sec(R). Since the space S 3 is irreducible, the general scroll containing a general point of
Sec(R) and Γ will not be contained in Sec(R).
(cid:3)

Claim 3.9. There exists a dense open set U ⊂ S 3 such that for S ∈ U the following hold:
Γ for every 1 ≤ i ≤ 7.

(1) The intersection S ∩ Sec(R) ∩ Ei is a ﬁnite set of points in X 4
(2) The scroll S does not contain any lines li,j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 7.
(3) The scroll S does not contain any conics through 3 of the points in Γ.
(4) The scroll S does not contain a twisted cubic curve through 5 of the points of Γ.
(5) The scroll S does not contain the rational normal quartic R.
(6) The scroll S does not contain a quintic curve double at one of the points of Γ and

passing through the others.

(7) The directrix of the scroll does not contain any of the points in Γ.

Proof. Since each of these conditions are closed conditions and S 3 is irreducible, it suﬃces
to exhibit one element S ∈ S 3 satisfying each condition. For (1), there exists a twisted
cubic containing Γ1,2,3,4 with any tangent line at p1 (for example, the reducible twisted cubic
consisting of any line through p1 and a conic through Γ2,3,4). Hence, the tangent spaces to
the scrolls at p1 sweep out E1 and there exists S such that S ∩ E1 6⊂ Sec(R). By permuting
indices, we conclude (1).

For (2) and (3), take the scroll ST,T ′ constructed in the proof of Claim 3.7. Since Π1,2,3,4 ∩
ST,T ′ = T , this scroll does not contain any of the linear li,j with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4 or any conic
passing through any of the three points in Γ1,2,3,4. By permuting indices, we conclude (2)
and (3).

Since a twisted cubic curve spans a P3 and the points are in linearly general position (4)
is clear. For (5), (6) and (7), it is more convenient to exhibit a reducible scroll satisfying
these properties. Let S be the union of the plane Π5,6,7 and a general quadric surface Q
containing l and Γ1,2,3,4. After choosing a point of l, this surface determines a point p of S 3
[C2]. The directrix line is then the unique line on the quadric Q intersecting l at p. Hence,
(7) holds. Since R is irreducible and nondegenerate, it cannot be contained in this surface.
Suppose there is a quintic curve F in S containing Γ and double at p1. Since p5, p6, p7 are
not collinear, F must intersect Π5,6,7 in a curve of degree at least 2. Hence, F intersects Q in
a curve of degree 3 containing Γ2,3,4 and double at p1. Any cubic double at p1 must contain
the line of ruling through p1. Since Γ1,2,3,4 are linearly general there cannot be a degree 2
curve through these points on Q. After permuting indices, we conclude (6) holds.
(cid:3)

Claim 3.10. There exists a dense open set U ⊂ S 3 such that for S ∈ U the intersection
S ∩ Sec(R) is an irreducible degree 9 curve double along Γ.

Proof. By Claim 3.8 and Claim 3.9, we can ﬁnd a scroll S 6⊂ Sec(R) and satisfying the
conclusions of Claim 3.9. The intersection S ∩ Sec(R) is a curve B of degree 9 double along
Γ. We need to show that B is irreducible. Recall that a smooth cubic scroll is isomorphic
to the blow-up of P2 at a point. Its Picard group is generated by the directrix e (the curve
of self-intersection −1) and the class of a ﬁber line f . The intersection numbers are

e2 = −1,

e · f = 1,

f 2 = 0.

The eﬀective cone is spanned by e and f . The canonical class is −2e − 3f and the class of
B is 3e + 6f . The degree of a curve ke + mf is k + m. If k > m, then any representative
contains e with multiplicity k − m. By adjunction, the arithmetic genus of a curve in the
classes e + mf , 2e + mf and 3e + mf are 0, m − 2 and 2m − 5, respectively.

14

I. COSKUN, J. LESIEUTRE, AND J. C. OTTEM

It is now straightforward, but somewhat tedious to check that B cannot be reducible.
Suppose B is reducible. Unfortunately, B can have many components. Write B = B1 ∪ B2,
where the class of B1 is ke + mf with 2 ≤ k ≤ 3 and assume that B1 does not contain
any ﬁbers as components. Furthermore, if k = 3, we may assume that B1 is irreducible.
Otherwise, we can regroup a component with class e + m′f with B2. Then the class of B2
is (3 − k)e + (6 − m)f and every ﬁber component of B is included in B2. By Claim 3.9 (2),
a curve with class mf can be double at most in 0 ≤ d ≤ m
2 points of Γ in which case it can
contain at most m − 2d of the remaining points of Γ. We tabulate the possibilities for curves
with class e + mf .

Claim 3.9 (3,2)
Claim 3.9 (4,3,2)
Claim 3.9 (7,5,4,3,2)
Claim 3.9 (7,5,4,3,2)

First, suppose B1 has class 3e + mf . By assumption, it is irreducible and by arithmetic
genus considerations can have at most 2m−5 nodes. On the other hand, B2 can pass through
at most 6 − m of the points. We have 2m − 5 + 6 − m = m + 1 < 7 if m < 6. Hence, such a
curve cannot be double at all the points of Γ.

We may therefore assume that the class of B1 is 2e+mf and the class of B2 is e+(6−m)f .
If B1 is reducible, then it can have at most 2 components with classes e + m1f and e + m2f .
An inspection of the above table shows that it is not possible to make B double at all points
of Γ. If B1 is irreducible, then m ≥ 2 and its arithmetic genus is m − 2. Hence, the maximal
number of double points on B1 is m − 2. If m = 2, B1 can contain at most 6 of the points
of Γ by Claim 3.9 (5) and it is smooth at those points. Hence, B cannot be made double
at all points of Γ by the last line of the table. If m = 3 and B1 has a double point, then
by Claim 3.9 (6) B1 contains at most 5 other points of Γ. By the second to last row of the
table, B cannot be double at all points of Γ. If m ≥ 4, an easy inspection of the ﬁrst three
rows of the table show that B can have at most 6 double points. We conclude that B is
irreducible.

This concludes the proof of Theorem 3.6 and consequently of Theorem 3.5.

cone of curves is linearly generated.

Proposition 4.1. The cone Eﬀ 1(X n

r ) is linearly generated if and only if r ≤ 2n.

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that the linear system of quadrics through 2n very general points is
nef. Choose n general quadrics Q1, . . . , Qn in Pn. By Bertini’s theorem, the intersection of
these quadrics is a set of 2n points in Pn. Let X0 be the blow-up of Pn at these points. We
i=1 Ei is nef on X0. Note that the proper transforms of Qi have
class D and D has positive degree on curves contained in exceptional divisors Ei. Since the

claim that D = 2H −P2n

EFFECTIVE CYCLES ON BLOW-UPS OF Pn

intersection Q1 ∩ · · · ∩ Qn is ﬁnite, if B is a curve on X0 not contained in an exceptional
divisor, there is a quadric Qi whose proper transform does not contain B. Consequently,
i=1 Ei is nef for very general
conﬁgurations of 2n points as well. We conclude that if r ≤ 2n, an eﬀective curve class in
X n
r satisﬁes the inequalities in the assumptions of Lemma 2.4, and so every curve class is a
linear combination of classes of lines.

D · B ≥ 0 and D is nef. By [La, Prop. 1.4.14], 2H − P2n
The top self-intersection of the class Q = 2H −Pr

r is given by 2n − r. Hence,
if r > 2n, then the top self-intersection of Q is negative and Q cannot be nef by Kleiman’s
Theorem [La, Theorem 1.4.9]. Suppose the class of every eﬀective curve is in the span of
the classes of lines. The cone generated by the classes of lines is a closed cone. Hence, the
eﬀective and the pseudoeﬀective cones coincide. Since every line has nonnegative intersection
with Q, we conclude that Q is nef. This contradiction shows that there must exist eﬀective
curves whose classes are not spanned by the classes of lines.
(cid:3)

i=1 Ei on X n

We obtain the following consequence.

r ) is not linearly generated.

Corollary 4.2. If r ≥ 2n−k+1 + k, then Eﬀ k(X n
Proof. Let Γ be a set of r very general points. Project Γ from the ﬁrst k−1 points p1, . . . , pk−1
and let Γ′ be the set of points in Pn−k+1 consisting of the images of the remaining points.
Then Γ′ is a set of r − k + 1 very general points in Pn−k+1.
If r − k + 1 > 2n−k+1, the
cone Eﬀ 1(X n−k+1
r−k+1 ) is not linearly generated by Proposition 4.1. Fix a 1-cycle B with class
i=k biEi,1 that is not in the span of linear spaces. In particular, 2a <Pr

Remark 4.1. The answer to Question 4.1 is aﬃrmative for curves and divisors. For cycles of
intermediate dimension, we do not know any examples with r = 2n−k+1 + k − 1 where the
cone is linearly generated.

There has been a great deal of interest in the construction of cycles that are nef but
not pseudoeﬀective. Such cycles were constructed on abelian varieties in [DELV], and on

We can, however, give a linear bound.

Theorem 4.3. The cone Eﬀ k(X n

r ) is linearly generated if r ≤ 2n − k + 1.

Proof. The theorem is true for k = 1 by Lemma 4.1 and for divisors by Theorem 3.1. We
will prove the general case by induction on n. Assume that the theorem is true for Eﬀ k(X m

for r ≤ 2m − k + 1 and all k < m < n. Let Γ be a set of r points such that Γ consists

8 ). In this subsection, we prove that Eﬀ 2(X 4

8 ) is linearly generated.

To illustrate the range of applicable techniques, we give two diﬀerent degeneration argu-

ments to prove this result.
Proof 1. Let Γ be a conﬁguration of 8 points in P4 such that p1, . . . , p7 are very general
points and p8 is a general point on Sec(R), where Sec(R) is the secant variety of the rational
normal curve R through the points p1, . . . , p7. Let Y be an irreducible surface in XΓ. If Y is
i=1 2biEi,1 − b8E8,1.
i=1 Ei − 2E8 has base locus the lines li,8 joining pi to p8 for
1 ≤ i ≤ 7. Any eﬀective member of this linear system is a quadric cone with vertex at p8.
Let q1, . . . , q7 denote the projection of p1, . . . , p7 through p8. These are very general 7 points
in P3. Hence, the base locus of the linear system of quadric surfaces containing them is the 7
points. Taking cones with vertex at p8, we conclude that the base locus of the linear system
|Q| is the locus of lines li,8, 1 ≤ i ≤ 7 as claimed.

not contained in Sec(R), then Y ∩ Sec(R) is a curve with class 3aH1 −P7
The linear system Q = 2H −P7

None of these lines li,8 are contained in Sec(R). To see this, take the intersection of Sec(R)
with a hyperplane containing 3 of the points p1, . . . , p7. The intersection is a cubic surface
with ﬁnitely many lines. Hence, the general point q does not contain any lines meeting
p1, . . . , p3. Since this is an open condition, the general point of Sec(R) does not have any
lines passing through p1, . . . , p7. Since p8 was chosen as a general point of Sec(R), the claim
follows. We conclude that the class Q restricts to a semi-ample, in particular, nef class on
i=1 bi ≥ 0 and Y is linearly generated. We may

Sec(R). Hence, Q Sec(R)Y = 6a − 2P8

therefore assume that Y ⊂ Sec(R).

Since p8 is a general point of Sec(R), by Claims 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10, the space of cubic scrolls
containing p1, . . . , p8 is two-dimensional and there is a nonempty open subset of scrolls such
that the proper transform of a scroll S intersects Sec(R) in an irreducible curve B. An

EFFECTIVE CYCLES ON BLOW-UPS OF Pn

17

incidence correspondence argument shows that the space of scrolls containing the 8 points
is irreducible of dimension 2. Consider triples (Q1, Π, P ) consisting a quadric cone Q1 with
vertex at p8 and containing the other 7 points, a plane Π on Q1 not containing the points
p1, . . . , p7 and a pencil P of quadrics containing Π and the 8 points. This space is irreducible
of dimension 3 and dominates the space of scrolls with one dimensional ﬁbers. Now taking
another general point q of Sec(R), there exists two scrolls containing the 9 points. We
conclude that the curves B are moving curves on Sec(R). Hence, S and Y intersect in
(cid:3)

i=1 bi ≥ 0. We conclude that Y is linearly generated.

ﬁnitely many points and 3a −P8

Proof 2. It suﬃces to show that the class γ = 3H 2 − E1,2 − . . . − E8,2 is nef. In doing so, we
may suppose that the points p1, . . . , p8 are in special position; a surface S so that S · γ < 0
on a general blow-up specializes to an eﬀective 2-cycle with the same property.

Let P1, P2 denote the x2x3x4-plane and x0x1x2-plane in P4 respectively, and for i = 1, 2
let qi be a cone over a smooth conic in Pi passing through the three coordinate points. We
specialize the eight points p1, . . . , p8 so that p1, . . . , p5 are the coordinate points in P4 and
p6, p7, p8 are general points on the intersection q1 ∩ q2.

On X, the strict transform Q1 of q1 has class 2H −P Ei − E1 − E2. Consider the divisor
D1 = 3H − 2P Ei + E1 + E2 and note that [Q1] · [D1] = 2γ. We compute that the linear

system |D1| is 2-dimensional. Moreover, the base locus of D1 is one-dimensional and has 18
components; 15 lines and three quartic normal curves. One checks that none of these curves
lie on Q1. Indeed, this is easy to check for one particular conﬁguration (and thus it follows
a general 8-tuple as above). In particular, D1|Q1 has only ﬁnitely many base-points, hence
is semiample on Q1.

Suppose that S ⊂ X is an irreducible surface. Then if S is not contained in Q1, the
intersection i∗S is represented by an eﬀective 1-cycle on Q1 (here i : Q1 → X is the inclusion).
In this case we have by nefness of D1, 2γ · S = D1|Q1 · i∗S ≥ 0, as desired.

We are therefore led to consider the case S ⊂ Q1. Now, considering instead the classes

Q2 = 2H −P Ei − E3 − E4 and D2 = 3H − 2P Ei + E3 + E4, and arguing as above, we

obtain that a surface S with S · γ < 0 must be contained in Q2, and hence in the intersection
Q1 ∩ Q2. However, Q1 ∩ Q2 is an irreducible surface, so S = Q1 ∩ Q2. Finally, note that
[Q1][Q2] equals 4H 2 − 2E1,2 − 2E2,2 − 2E3,2 − 2E4,2 − E5,2 − E6,2 − E7,2 − E8,2, which has
intersection number 0 with γ. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

We immediately deduce the following corollary.

Corollary 4.5. If X n

r is a Mori Dream Space, then Eﬀ k(X n

r ) is ﬁnitely generated.

Remark 4.2. Combining Prop. 4.4 with the degeneration argument of Theorem 4.3, it follows
that Eﬀ 2(X n

r ) is linearly generated for r ≤ 2n as long as n ≥ 4.

We will see in the next section that Eﬀ 2(X 4

10) is not ﬁnitely generated, assuming the SHGH
conjecture holds for blow-ups of P2 at 10 points. The only remaining case in dimension 4 is:

Question 4.2. Is the cone Eﬀ 2(X 4

It is not easy to ﬁnd explicit curves in X n

r which are not in the span of lines. The following

example gives a construction in the case of 9 very general points in P3.

i∗(CCM ) = 78H1 − 21E1,1 −

18Ei,1.

Xi=2

We have 21 + 8(18) = 165, while 2 · 78 = 156. Hence, this curve is not in the span of the
lines. It does not, however, deﬁne an extremal ray on Eﬀ 1(X 3
9 ). In the next section, we will
use a similar construction to show that assuming the SHGH conjecture, the cone Eﬀ 1(X 3
9 )
is not ﬁnitely generated.

By repeatedly taking cones over i∗(CCM ), we obtain explicit non-linearly generated codimension-

two cycles on X n

n+6 for every n ≥ 3.

Complete intersections also provide examples of nonlinearly generated pseudoeﬀective

curve classes, provided that the number of points is large.

Example 4.2. Assume that dn ≥ r > 2dn−1 for some integer d > 2. Then the divisor class
r by the argument given in the proof of Proposition 4.1. The

(n − 1)-fold self-intersection of the class is

Ei,1.

Since r > 2dn−1, this class is not in the span of lines. On the other hand, the class is
pseudoeﬀective. A small perturbation of D is ample. Hence, a suﬃciently high multiple is
very ample and the (n − 1)-fold self-intersection is an eﬀective curve. It follows that the class
Dn−1 is pseudoeﬀective.

5. Non-finitely generated cones

The cone of curves the blow-up of P2 at 10 or more very general points is not entirely

understood, and we will ﬁnd it useful to assume the following standard conjecture.

Conjecture 1 (Segre–Harbourne–Gimigliano–Hirschowitz (SHGH) conjecture, [G]). Sup-

We next prove that the cone of codimension-2 cycles on X n

r is not ﬁnitely generated for
r ≥ n+6, assuming the SHGH conjecture. The calculation relies on the following observation
of de Fernex.

Theorem 5.1 ([DF, Prop. 3.4]). Assume the SHGH conjecture holds for 10 points. Let
P ⊂ N 1(X 2

10) be the positive cone

P =(cid:8)D ∈ N 1(X 2

10) : D2 ≥ 0, D · H ≥ 0(cid:9) ,

EFFECTIVE CYCLES ON BLOW-UPS OF Pn

19

where H is an ample divisor. Then

Eﬀ 1(X 2

10) ∩ K≥0 = P ∩ K≥0.

Let Q ⊂ X 3

9 be the strict transform of the unique quadric passing through the 9 points.
Note that Q is isomorphic to X 2
10, and so Conjecture 1 provides some information about the
cone Eﬀ 1(Q). However, the map N1(Q) → N1(X 3
9 ) is not injective, since the two rulings
of the quadric both map to the class of a line in P3. The next lemma gives a criterion to
show that certain extremal rays on Eﬀ 1(Q) nevertheless push forward to extremal rays on
Eﬀ 1(X 3

9 ).

Write r1 and r2 for the classes of the two rulings on the quadric, and let fi = Ei|Q be the
exceptional curves. Let ℓij = r1 − fi − fj ∈ N1(Q); this class is not eﬀective on Q, but i∗ℓij
is eﬀective in N1(X 3

9 ) since it is the class of a line through the points pi and pj.

Theorem 5.2. Suppose that D is a class in N1(Q) which satisﬁes:

(1) D is nef, and if γ ∈ Eﬀ 1(Q) has D · γ = 0, then γ is a multiple of D;
(2) D · KQ > 0;
(3) D · r1 = D · r2;
(4) D · ℓij > 0 for all i and j;
Then i∗D is extremal on Eﬀ 1(X 3
9 ).
Proof. We claim ﬁrst that D lies on a two-dimensional extremal face of the cone

Σ = Eﬀ 1(Q) +Xi,j

R≥0[ℓij] + R[r1 − r2] ⊂ N1(Q).

More precisely, if D = α + β with α, β ∈ Σ, then

α = a1D + b1(r1 − r2)

and β = a2D + b2(r1 − r2),

where a1 and a2 are positive. Note that D is nef, D · (r1 − r2) = 0, D · ℓij > 0 for all i, j,
and D · fk > 0. Hence D is contained in the dual cone of Σ. By conditions (1) and (3), the
classes in Σ with D · C = 0 are precisely R≥0D + R(r1 − r2).

We claim next that

Eﬀ 1(X 3

9 ) = i∗ Eﬀ 1(Q) +Xi,j

R≥0i∗[ℓij] = i∗Σ.

Suppose that Γ is an irreducible eﬀective cycle on Eﬀ 1(X 3

9 ). If Q · Γ < 0, then Γ must be

contained in Q, and so [Γ] is contained in i∗ Eﬀ 1(Q). If Q · Γ ≥ 0, then Γ satisﬁes 2a ≥Pi bi,
which means that [Γ] is in the span of classes of lines i∗[ℓij] and lines i∗[fk] in the exceptional
divisors, by Lemma 2.4. Each fk is numerically equivalent to a curve in the quadric.
Suppose now that i∗D = α +β, where α and β are pseudoeﬀective classes on Eﬀ 1(X 3
ing the decomposition above, we can write α = i∗αQ +P ciji∗[ℓij] and β = i∗βQ +P diji∗[ℓij],

where αQ and βQ are classes in Eﬀ 1(Q). Because D · KQ > 0 while KQ · ℓij = 0, it must be
that αQ 6= 0.

9 ). Us-

We claim now that

D = αQ + βQ +X(cij + dij)ℓij + f (r1 − r2)

for some constant f . Indeed, the two sides diﬀer by an element of the kernel of i∗ : N1(Q) →
N1(X 3

9 ), which is generated by r1 − r2, giving rise to the constant f .

20

I. COSKUN, J. LESIEUTRE, AND J. C. OTTEM

Since D2 = 0, D · (r1 − ei − ej) > 0 for any i and j, and D · (r1 − r2) = 0, it must be that

cij = dij = 0 for all i, j and all k. We conclude that

αQ = a1D + b1(r1 − r2) and βQ = a2D + b2(r1 − r2).

Hence α = i∗αQ = a1i∗D and β = i∗βQ = a2i∗D. This shows that i∗D is extremal.

(cid:3)

The requirement that KQ ·D > 0 makes it tricky to explicitly exhibit such classes, since the
KQ-positive part of Eﬀ 1(Q) is diﬃcult to determine without assuming the SHGH conjecture.

Theorem 5.3. Assume that the SHGH conjecture holds for blow-ups of P2 at 10 very general
points. Then there exist inﬁnitely many classes D satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 5.2.

Proof. It is convenient to ﬁx an identiﬁcation Q ∼= X 2
10 and rewrite the hypotheses in the
basis for N 1(Q) arising from this identiﬁcation. The strict transforms of the two rulings
through the point p1 give disjoint (−1)-curves on Q, and these can be contracted. The other
8 exceptional curves fi can then be contracted to give a map to P2. Let e0 and e1 be the
ﬁrst two (−1)-curves contracted, and let ej = fj for 2 ≤ j ≤ 8. With respect to this new
basis, we have r1 − f1 = e0 and r2 − f1 = e1, and f1 = h − e0 − e1, where h denotes the class
of a line on P2.

While the ﬁrst two conditions in Theorem 5.2 are independent of the basis, the last two

can be rewritten as

(3) D · e0 = D · e1.
(4) D · e0 > D · ej for any j > 1, and D · (h − e1 − ei − ej) > 0 for any i, j > 1.
The ﬁrst part of (4) arises when i = 1 < j, while the second case is when 1 < i < j.

We check each of the hypotheses in turn. To simplify notation, for the rest of this proof

R≥0[Ci],

where the Ci are KX -negative curves. According to Theorem 5.1,

Eﬀ 1(X) ∩ Eﬀ 1(X)KX≥0 = P ∩ K≥0.

Hence, it suﬃces to show that Dδ · C ≥ 0 if C is KX -negative, and that Dδ · C ≥ 0 if C has
C 2 ≥ 0 and C · H > 0.

First, suppose that C is a pseudoeﬀective class with KX · C < 0. We have

3Dδ − KX = (3δ − 1)(e0 + e1) + (3δ′ − 1)

ej,

However, since δ < 1/3, the number 3δ − 1 is negative. It is easy to check that δ′ < 1/3 as
well, and so the divisor on the right is a sum of exceptional divisors with negative coeﬃcients.
If C is any curve other than one of the ei, then both terms on the right are negative. If C
is one of the curves ei, then Dδ · C > 0 because δ and δ′ are both positive.

It remains to check that Dδ · C > 0 if C is a class with positive self-intersection. This

follows from the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality: suppose that d2 ≥P a2

Dδ · KQ = −3 + 2δ + 8δ′ > −3 + 10δ′ > 0,

(2) We have

since δ′ > 3/10.
(3) Since Dδ is of the form h − δe0 − δe1 − · · ·, we have D · e0 = D · e1.
(4) Because δ > δ′, we have D · e0 > D · ej for any j > 1. We also have D · (h − e1 − ei − ej) =
1 − δ − 2δ′ > 0, since δ′ < δ < 1/3.

Remark 5.1. One can even arrange that Dδ is a rational class through judicious choice of δ.
For example,

Assuming the SHGH conjecture, we can now conclude that Eﬀ 2(X n

ated if r ≥ n + 6. We need the following lemma, which guarantees that cones over extremal

Corollary 5.5. Assume the SHGH Conjecture for the blow-up of P2 at 10 points. Then
Eﬀ 2(X n

r ) is not ﬁnitely generated if r ≥ n + 6.

Proof of Lemma 5.4. Given r +1 very general points p0, . . . , pr in Pn+1, their projection from
p0 give r very general points in Pn. Let Di be eﬀective cycles arbitrarily close to D in Eﬀ k(X n
r ).
Then the classes of the cones CDi over Di converge to CD. Hence, CD ∈ Eﬀ k+1(X n+1

n+1, then D = aHk −Pr

Conversely, we claim that if CD = aHk+1 −aE0 −Pr

CD + ǫHk+1 is eﬀective for any ǫ > 0. Let Vǫ be a (rational) cycle representing the class
CD + ǫHk+1. Let ℓ0j denote the strict transform on X r+1
n+1 of the line through p0 and pj. By
Lemma 2.8, Vǫ contains the line ℓ0j with multiplicity βj ≥ bj − ǫ. Let L ⊂ X n+1
r+1 be the
proper transform of a general hyperplane in Pn+1. The lines l0j intersect L in r very general
points p. The proper transform of the intersection L ∩ Vǫ gives an eﬀective cycle with class

6. Blow-Ups at points in special position

Until now we have considered blow-ups of Pn at linearly general or very general points. It is
also interesting to consider cones of eﬀective cycles on blow-ups of Pn at special conﬁgurations
of points. The dependence of the cones on the position of the points can be subtle, which
makes degeneration arguments diﬃcult. We will see that the property of the eﬀective cone
being ﬁnite is neither an open nor closed condition, even in families where the vector space
of numerical classes of k-dimensional cycles has constant dimension.

general point p. Let qi denote the projection of pi form p and let Z′ be the projection of Z
from p. Then Z′ and Z have the same degree and the multiplicities of Z′ at qi are greater
than or equal to the multiplicities of Z at pi. Repeatedly projecting Z to Pm from general
points, we obtain an eﬀective cycle contained in Pm with the same class. Taking closures,
we obtain the reverse inclusion Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) ⊆ Eﬀ k(X m

If k ≥ m, let L be a k-dimensional linear space containing Γ. Then the proper transform L

By taking m = 1, we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 6.2. Suppose Γ is a set of r collinear points in Pn. Then Eﬀ k(X n

Remark 6.1. It was shown in [O1] that the blow-up of P2 in collinear points is a Mori Dream
Space (and indeed its Cox ring can be computed)2. Consequently, the cone of curves and
divisors are ﬁnite polyhedral. The previous corollary generalizes this to all cycles.

Let L ∼= Pn−1 be a hyperplane in Pn. Let Γ′ ⊂ L be a set of points p1, . . . , pr and let
p0 ∈ Pn be a point not contained in L. Let Γ = Γ′ ∪ {p0}. Let X n

Let Z be a cycle that generates an extremal ray of CEﬀ k(X n−1

). Suppose [Z] = α + β in
Eﬀ k+1(X n
), we must have
that both α and β satisfy b0 = a. We can perturb α and β by ǫHk+1 to obtain rational
eﬀective classes. Since the coeﬃcient of E0,k+1 of any class contained in Eﬀ k+1(X n−1
) is 0,
the coeﬃcients of any component of the class contained in Eﬀ k+1(X n−1
) are bounded by ǫ.
Taking cones over the classes of the hyperplane sections of the remaining subvarieties and
letting ǫ tend to zero, we see that both α and β are contained in CEﬀ k(X n−1
). By the
extremality of Z, we conclude that they are both proportional to [Z].

Corollary 6.4. Let Γ be a set of points {q1, . . . , q9, p1, . . . , ps−1} such that q1, . . . , q9 are
general points in a plane P ⊂ Pn and p1, . . . , ps−1 are linearly general points with span
disjoint from P . Then Eﬀ k(X n
Γ ) is not ﬁnitely generated for k ≤ s and linearly generated
for k > s.

Proof. When r ≥ 9, the blow-up of P2 at r general points has inﬁnitely many (−1)-curves,
which span extremal rays of the eﬀective cone of curves. Applying Proposition 6.3 (k − 1)-
times, the cones over the classes of (−1)-curves with vertex p1, . . . , pk−1 provide inﬁnitely

extremal rays of Eﬀ k(X n
from Proposition 6.1

Γ ) for k ≤ s. The linear generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) for k > s follows
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.5.

(1) Linear generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ) is not closed in smooth families.

(2) Finite generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) is not closed in smooth families.

Proof. Let n ≥ k + 8. Take a general smooth curve B in (Pn)k+8 which avoids all the
diagonals and contains a point 0 ∈ B where 9 of the points are general points in a plane P
and the remaining points are in linearly general position with span not intersecting P . Such
curves exist by Bertini’s Theorem since the diagonals have codimension n ≥ 2. Consider the
family X → B, where Xb is the blow-up of Pn in the k + 8 points Γb parameterized by b ∈ B.
If the points in Γb are in linearly general position, then by Lemma 3.3 the cone Eﬀ k(XΓb) is
linearly generated. In particular, the cone is ﬁnite. However, by Corollary 6.4, Eﬀ k(XΓ0) is
not ﬁnitely generated. In particular, the cone is not linearly generated.
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.6.

(1) Linear generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ) is not open in smooth families.

(2) Finite generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) is not open in smooth families.

Proof. Let B be a smooth curve parameterizing 9 general points in a plane P becoming
collinear at 0 ∈ B. Let Γ′ be k − 1 points in general linear position in Pn whose span is
disjoint from P . Let Γb be the union of Γ′ and the points parameterized by b. Consider the
family X → B obtained by blowing up Pn along Γb. When the points are collinear, Eﬀ k(XΓ0)
is linearly generated. However, for the general point of B, Eﬀ k(XΓb) is not ﬁnitely generated
by Corollary 6.4.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.2. Corollary 6.6 is well-known for cones of divisors. For example, Castravet-
Tevelev [CT] prove that the blow-up of Pn at points on a rational normal curve is a Mori
Dream Space. In particular, if we specialize a large number of points to lie on a rational
normal curve, we see that being a Mori Dream Space is not an open condition.

One can ask for the ﬁnite/linear generation of Eﬀ k(X n

Γ ) for Γ any special set of points.

Perhaps the following question is the most interesting among them.

Question 6.1. Let Γ be a set of points contained in a rational normal curve in Pn.
Eﬀ k(X n
eties of projections of the rational normal curve?

Is
Γ ) generated by the classes of cones over secant vari-

Γ ) ﬁnitely generated? Is Eﬀ k(X n

and divisors. The cone of curves Eﬀ 1(X n

of the rational normal curve nH1 −Pr

By results of Castravet and Tevelev, the answer to Question 6.1 is aﬃrmative for curves
Γ ) is generated by the class of the proper transform
i=1 Ei,1 and the classes of lines. The rational normal
curve is cut out by quadrics. If a curve B has positive intersection with a quadric containing
the points, then by Lemma 2.4 the class of B is spanned by the classes of lines. Otherwise, B
is contained in the base locus of all the quadrics containing the rational normal curve. Hence,
B is a multiple of the rational normal curve. Castravet and Tevelev show that the classes of
divisors are generated by linear spaces and codimension-1 cones over secant varieties of the
projection of the rational normal curve [CT]. We do not know whether Eﬀ 2(X n
Γ) is generated
by the classes of planes and cones over the rational normal curve with vertex a point of Γ.
