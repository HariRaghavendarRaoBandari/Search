ON THE ASYMPTOTIC LIMIT OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL

VLASOV-POISSON SYSTEM FOR LARGE MAGNETIC FIELD : FORMAL

DERIVATION.

PIERRE DEGOND AND FRANCIS FILBET

Abstract. This paper establishes the long time asymptotic limit of the three dimensional Vlasov–Poisson
equation with strong external magnetic ﬁeld. The guiding center approximation is investigated in
the three dimensional case with a non-constant magnetic ﬁeld. In the long time asymptotic limit,
the motion can be split in two parts : one stationary ﬂow along the lines of the magnetic ﬁeld
and the guiding center motion in the orthogonal plane of the magnetic ﬁeld where classical drift
velocities are recovered. We discuss in particular the eﬀect of nonconstant external magnetic ﬁelds.

1. Introduction

We consider a plasma conﬁned by a strong external nonconstant magnetic ﬁeld, hence the charged
gas evolves under its self-consistent electrostatic ﬁeld and the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld. This conﬁg-
uration is typical of a tokamak plasma [3, 38] where the magnetic ﬁeld is used to conﬁne particles
inside the core of the device.

We assume that on the time scale we consider, collisions can be neglected both for ions and
electrons, hence collective eﬀects are dominant and the plasma is entirely modelled with kinetic
transport equations, where the unknown is the number density of particles f ≡ f (t, x, v) depending
on time t ≥ 0, position x ∈ Ω ⊂ R3 and velocity v ∈ R3.

Such a kinetic model provides an appropriate description of turbulent transport in a fairly general
context, but it requires to solve a six dimensional problem which leads to a huge computational
cost.

To reduce the cost of numerical simulations, it is classical to derive asymptotic models with a
smaller number of variables than the kinetic description. Large magnetic ﬁelds usually lead to
the so-called drift-kinetic limit [1, 13, 30, 31] and we refer to [8, 12, 17, 18, 19, 22] for recent
mathematical results on this topic. In this regime, due to the large applied magnetic ﬁeld, particles
are conﬁned along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and their period of rotation around these lines (called
the cyclotron period) becomes small. It corresponds to the ﬁnite Larmor radius scaling for the
Vlasov–Poisson equation, which was introduced by Frénod and Sonnendrücker in the mathematical
literature [17, 18]. The two-dimensional version of the system (obtained when one restricts to the
perpendicular dynamics) and the large magnetic ﬁeld limit were studied in [19] and more recently
in [8, 21, 25]. We also refer to the recent work [29] of Hauray and Nouri, dealing with the well-
posedness theory with a diﬀusive version of a related two dimensional system. A version of the
full three dimensional system describing ions with massless electrons was studied by the author in
[26, 28].

Here, we formally derive a new asymptotic model under both assumptions of large magnetic
ﬁelds and large time asymptotic limit for the three dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system. Analogous
problem has already been carefully studied by F. Golse and L. Saint-Raymond in two dimension
[22, 41, 23].

We consider a plasma model in which we focus on the dynamics of the fast electrons and the

magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be given.

In the large magnetic ﬁeld regime, the Lorentz force term in the Vlasov equation is scaled by a
large parameter, 1/ε, where ε stands for the dimensionless ion cyclotron period, i.e. the rotation
period of the electrons about a magnetic ﬁeld line (or Larmor rotation). The so called drift-kinetic
or gyro-kinetic regimes are reached when ε tends to zero (see [30, 35]).

Here we are interested in the long time behavior of the distribution of electrons since they can
be considered as fast particles compared to the characteristic velocity of electrons. In this limit,
the new distribution function only depends on space, time and two components of the velocity,
corresponding to the parallel component along the magnetic ﬁeld line and the magnitude of the
perpendicular velocity. In other words, the distribution function is independent of the gyro-phase
of the perpendicular velocity in the plane normal to the magnetic ﬁeld line. This is a consequence
of the ultra-fast cyclotron rotation about the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

It is also convenient to express the distribution in terms of the parallel velocity and the magnetic
moment or adiabatic invariant, which is proportional to the perpendicular energy divided by the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Now, the distribution function in these new variables satisﬁes a transport equation with a con-
straint. A Lagrange multiplier allows to express this constraint in the diﬀerential system. The
constraint expresses that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the fast
parallel motion along the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

The derivation of the model roughly follows the following steps: we ﬁrst proceed with formal
expansions of the distribution function with respect to the parameter ε. Now, carrying the Hilbert
expansion procedure through for the distribution function equation is best done if we change the
random velocity variable into a coordinate system consisting of the parallel velocity, the energy,
and the angle of rotation or gyrophase around the magnetic ﬁeld line.

Thanks to this coordinate change, we show that the leading order term of the distribution
function does not depend on the gyrophase. Next, we realize that, at each level of the expansion,
we are led to inverting the gyrophase averaging operator [30, 31]. We show that the inverse operator
can only act on functions satisfying a speciﬁc solvability condition, namely that their gyrophase
average is zero. We ﬁnd the asymptotic model following the classical Hilbert expansion procedure
of kinetic theory. Providing an explicit expression of the Hilbert expansion procedure is achieved
here assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld only acts in the z direction.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the scaling which
expresses the assumptions of strong magnetic ﬁeld and long time asymptotic regime. Then, we
present and comment the main result of this article, namely the asymptotic model. In Section 4,

by using Hilbert expansions we derive the asymptotic model and provide the main computational
steps which lead to the explicit partial diﬀerential system for the limit distribution function.

2. Scaling and main results

2.1. The Vlasov equation in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. We are interested in the dynamics of
a single species negatively charged fast electrons in the plasma. At this stage of the study, the
coupling with the ions is discarded and the electric ﬁeld is given by the Poisson equation whereas
the magnetic ﬁeld is external.

We investigate the asymptotic limit of the Vlasov equation describing the long time dynamics of

the electrons when they are submitted to an asymptotically large external magnetic ﬁeld.

Denoting by m the electron mass and by q the negative charge of the electron, we start from the

Vlasov equation

(1)

∂f
∂t

+ v · ∇xf +

q
m

(E + v × Bext) · ∇vf = 0,

where f ≡ f (t, x, v) is the distribution function and x ∈ Ω ⊂ R3, v ∈ R3, and t ∈ R+ are
respectively the position, velocity, and time variables.

Then, we prescribe an initial datum

(2)

f (0, x, v) = fin(x, v), x ∈ Ω, v ∈ R3

where fin is the distribution function of particles initially present inside the domain Ω.

Next, we introduce a set of characteristic scales from which an appropriate scaling of equation

(1) will be derived.

The characteristic length scale of the problem x is the Debye length

λD =   kBT

4π n q2!1/2

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature scale and n is the density scale. Then,
the characteristic magnitude of the electric ﬁeld can be expressed from n and x by E = 4πq2n x and
the characteristic velocity of electrons v is the thermal velocity of the electrons, vth = (kBT /m)1/2.

Therefore, the plasma frequency of electrons satisﬁes

ω−1

p =

x
v

,

which corresponds to one time scale. Moreover, we denote by B the characteristic magnitude of
the applied magnetic ﬁeld and deﬁne ωc = qB
m the characteristic electron cyclotron frequency, and
ω−1
c

corresponds to a second time scale.

Hence we deﬁne the new variables and given ﬁelds by

x′ =

x

, v′ =

v

t′ =

t
t

, E′(t′, x′) =

E(t, x)

E

, B′

ext(t′, x′) =

Bext(t, x)

B

.

Subsequently, letting f = n/v3 the distribution function scale, we introduce the new unknown

f ′(t′, x′, v′) =

f (t, x, v)

f

.

Inserting all these changes into (1), dividing by ωp and dropping the primes for clarity, we obtain
the dimensionless equation

(3)

ωpt

∂f
∂t

+ v · ∇xf +  E +

ωc

v × Bext! · ∇vf = 0.

When the external magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be large, the rotation period of the electrons about
the magnetic ﬁeld lines becomes small. We introduce the dimensionless cyclotron period

ε =

ωc

4

PIERRE DEGOND AND FRANCIS FILBET

and since we are interested in asymptotically large time scale, we also have that

ε =

t ωp

Then, under this scaling, the Vlasov equation (3) for f = fε takes the form:

(4)

∂f ε
∂t

+ v · ∇xf ε + (cid:18)E +

ε

v × Bext(cid:19) · ∇vf ε = 0,

with initial conditions still given by (2).

2.2. Assumptions and main result. To simplify the presentation and the following calculation,
we assume that Ω = R3 and the external magnetic ﬁeld only applies in the z-direction

(5)
where x = (x, y, z)t ∈ R3 with x⊥ = (x, y) and xk = z. The velocity variable will be denoted in the
same manner v = (v⊥, vk), with v⊥ = (vx, vy) and vk = vz.

Bext(t, x) = (0, 0, b(t, x⊥))t

Since the external magnetic ﬁeld must satisfy the Gauss’s law for magnetism

∇x · Bext = 0,

it gives that indeed b only depends on x⊥ ∈ R2 and t ∈ R+. Furthermore, we assume that b does
not vanish and is smooth: there exists α > 0 such that

(6)

b ∈ W 1,∞(R+ × R2),

b(t, x⊥) > α.

Under these assumptions, the Vlasov equation (4) can be written in a simple form, which allows

us to ignore curvature eﬀects

where the operator ⊥ corresponds to a rotation of −π/2 along the axis (0z) and therefore it
only acts on the v⊥ = (vx, vy) component and keeps the third component identical :
for any
v = (v⊥, vk) ∈ R3, we have v⊥ = (vy, −vx, vz).

Let us ﬁrst emphasize that applying the arguments of A.A. Arsen’ev [2] and R. DiPerna and

P.-L. Lions [5], we easily prove the existence of weak solutions for any ε > 0.

Theorem 2.1. Assume the magnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes (5)-(6) and the initial datum f ε

Then there is a weak solution (f ε, Eε) to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7), where f ε ∈ L∞(R+, L1 ∩
L∞(R6)), the charge densities ρε is such that

and

ρε ∈ L∞(R+; L5/3(R3))

Eε ∈ L∞(R+; L2 ∩ W 1,5/3(R3)).

Note here that the Lp and energy estimates hold uniformly with respect to ε > 0. Furthermore,
this results strongly relies on the energy estimate, which is uniform with respect to ε > 0. We
deﬁne the total energy associated to (7)

E ε(t) := ZR6

|Eε|2 dx ≤ E ε(0).

The aim of this paper is then to obtain a systematic expansion of Hilbert type of the function
(f ε, Eε) solution to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7) and to study the asymptotic model formally
obtained by taking the limit ε → 0.

Let us assume that (f ε, Eε) can be written as

(10)

f ε = Xk∈N

εk fk, Eε = Xk∈N

εk Ek,

where for any k ∈ N, fk and Ek do not depend on ε. The existence of such an expansion would
guarantee that f ε and Eε and their derivatives with respect to x and v are uniformly bounded, at
least if the functions fk, Ek are suﬃciently smooth.

In particular we assume that

(11)

εk fin,k,

f ε

in = Xk∈N

where for any k ∈ N, fin,k does not depend on ε > 0.

To introduce the gyroaveraging operator in the orthogonal plane to magnetic ﬁeld, we will work

in polar coordinate for v⊥ = (vx, vy) ∈ R2,

(12)

(cid:26) vx = w cos(θ),

vy = w sin(θ),

and set ew = (cos θ, sin θ), eθ = −e⊥
operator Π deﬁned for every function f (v) by

w = (− sin θ, cos θ). Then we introduce the gyroaveraging

(13)

Πf (w, vk) =

1

2π Z 2π

f (v⊥, vk)dθ,

where in the integral v⊥ is expressed thanks to the change of coordinate (12).

Theorem 2.2 (Formal expansion of f ε and Eε). Let us consider an external the magnetic ﬁeld
such that (5)-(6) and f ε
in a nonnegative function satisfying (8), (9) and (11). Assume there exists
a sequence (fk, Ek)k∈N such that the weak solutions (f ε, Eε)ε to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7) can
be expanded as (10) for all ε > 0. Then,

(cid:26) E0 ≡ EF (t, x),

f0 ≡ F (t, x, w, vk)

and there exists (P, EP ) with P ≡ P (t, x, w, vk) such that (F, P, EF , EP ) is solution to the following

and the electric ﬁelds EF , EP are such that EQ = −∇φQ, for Q = F, P and φQ solves the Poisson
equation with source terms ρQ,

(16)

− ∆φQ = ρQ := 2πZR+×R

Moreover, the following relation holds

Let us emphasize that the ﬁrst equation of (14) means that F and P do not depend of the
gyrophase θ ∈ [0, 2π], but on w = kv⊥k.
In this model, F is determined by (14) while the
unknown function P plays the role of the Lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint in
(14). This constraint reﬂects the fact that the fast parallel motion along the magnetic ﬁeld line is
instantaneously relaxed and F is constant along these trajectories. In other words, there are three
time scales for a particle moving in a large magnetic ﬁeld:

• the fastest time scale corresponds to the cyclotron or Larmor rotation period about the

magnetic ﬁeld. This time scale is eliminated here by averaging over θ ∈ (0, 2π);

• the second fastest scale is the scale of the parallel motion along the magnetic ﬁeld line,

which is described here by the constraint in (14);

• the slow time scale corresponds to the various drifts across the magnetic ﬁeld lines, due
to spatio-temporal variations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the system (14), we focus on
the slow time scale, which corresponds to the large time behavior of the solution to the
Vlasov-Poisson system (7).

Of course these various drifts are often obtained directly on the particle trajectories, but the
averaging eﬀect is diﬃcult to justify and is only valid for slowly varying electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The use of the kinetic model directly provides a way to do it by imposing constraints on the
distribution function. This easier derivation reﬂects the fact that, to some extent, the distribution
function describes the particle dynamics in a statistical sense. Averaging the trajectories over some
fast component is best done by looking at the evolution of an observable of the system which is
constant over this fast motion.

3. Fundamental properties of the asymptotic model

In this section, we prove some fundamental properties satisﬁed by the asymptotic model (14),

which illustrates the physical validity of the present approach. In the following, we show that

• we recover the classical drift velocity E × B and the gradient drift velocity;
• the asymptotic model satisﬁes conservation of energy;
• the magnetic moment is an invariant of the asymptotic model.

3.1. Drift velocities. The drift velocity U⊥ corresponds to the sum of classical guiding center
drift UE and U∇B. Indeed, the external magnetic ﬁeld only acts on the z-direction, Bext = (0, 0, b),
then we ﬁrst recover the drift velocity called E × B

UE =

and the so called gradient-B drift,

U∇B =

Here there is no curvature drift since we considered this simple external magnetic ﬁeld Bext =
(0, 0, b).

Proposition 3.1. Let f ε
in be a nonnegative function satisfying (8)-(9) and (11). Assume that the
limiting system (14) has a smooth solution (F, EF ) and (P, EP ). Then, for any Θ ∈ C1(R) such
that

ZR3×R+×R

Θ(F (0)) w dw dvk dx < +∞,

we have

ZR3×R+×R

Θ(F (t)) w dw dvk dx = ZR3×R+×R

Θ(F (0)) w dw dvk dx.

Proof. Assuming that F is a smooth solution to (14) together with a smooth P , we multiply (14)
by Θ′(F ) and integrate with respect to (x, w, vk) ∈ R3 × R+ × R. Then, using that

and observing that

hence the results follows.

(cid:3)

From Proposition 3.1, we get classical Lp estimates, for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, on the distribution

function F : for all t ∈ R+

(18)

kF (t)kLp ≤ kF0kLp

and F (t) ≥ 0 for any nonnegative initial data F0.

Another remarkable property of our model is the preservation of the energy structure. Let us

deﬁne the total energy E 0(t): for a smooth solution (F, EF ) to (14),

It is worth to mention here that these a priori estimates on the distribution function F and the
electric ﬁeld EF would give enough compactness to treat the nonlinear term U⊥bF , but we do
not get any estimate on the additional term (P, EP ) so that the existence of weak solution to the
limiting system (14) is still an open problem.

In order to establish a convergence result, we apply a formal analysis of the system (7). Apply-
ing a standard Hilbert expansion to (f ε, Eε) solution to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7), we get a
hierarchy of diﬀerential equations which have to be solved at each order. Here, we take advantage
of the simple structure of the magnetic ﬁeld to solve explicitly each problem and get the asymptotic
model (14).

4.1. The Hilbert expansion. Since the leading order term in (7) involves the eﬀect of a circular
motion around the magnetic ﬁeld lines, we now speciﬁcally examine the properties of this operator.
Let us denote by L the following operator

We have the following result

Lf = −b(t, x⊥) v⊥ · ∇vf.

10

PIERRE DEGOND AND FRANCIS FILBET

Lemma 4.1. Assume that b satisﬁes (5)-(6). Then, the null space ker L of L consists of functions
which only depend on the parallel component vk and on the amplitude of v⊥, that is, w = kv⊥k,

(24)

Lf = 0 ⇐⇒ f (v) ≡ ˜f (w, vk) with (w, vk) ∈ R+ × R.

Proof. On the one hand, we notice that the magnetic ﬁeld Bext only acts on v⊥ = (vx, vy), which
means that

Lf = −b(t, x⊥) v⊥

⊥ · ∇v⊥f,

where now ⊥ acts on a vector of R2 and v⊥
polar coordinates on v⊥ ∈ R2, it yields

⊥ = (vy, −vx). Then, applying a change of variable to

Lf = b(t, x⊥)

∂f
∂θ

.

From (6), the magnetic ﬁeld does not vanish, hence we get Lf = 0 if and only if f (v) ≡ ˜f (w, vk),
which proves (24).

(cid:3)

Now, our goal is to ﬁnd the asymptotic limit ε → 0 to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7). We start

by assuming that (f ε, Eε) admits an Hilbert expansion:

and

f ε = f0 + ε f1 + ε2 f2 + . . . ,

Eε = E0 + ε E1 + ε2 E2 + . . .

Inserting these expansions in the Vlasov-Poisson system (7), we ﬁnd for the leading order ε−2, ε−1
and ε0 that

(25)
(26)

(27)

Lf0 = 0.
Lf1 = v · ∇xf0 + E0 · ∇xf0.

Lf2 =

∂f0
∂t

+ v · ∇xf1 + E0 · ∇vf1 + E1 · ∇vf0.

In order to solve eq. Lf = h, we proceed in two steps :

• we verify the solvability condition Π h = 0;
• we compute f by integrating h over θ.

4.2. Proof of Theorem 2.2. In this section we derive an asymptotic model for the limit f0 of
f ε by formally passing to the limit ε → 0 in the Vlasov-Poisson system (7). This model will be
deduced by solving the sequence of equations appearing in the Hilbert expansion (25)-(27).

First, by a simple application of Lemma 4.1, the leading order of the Hilbert expansion (25) can
be directly solved. The function f0 does not depend on θ ∈ [0, 2π] and f0 ≡ F (t, x, w, vk) for any
v = (v⊥, vk) ∈ R3 and at time t = 0, we set F (0) = Πfin,0, where fin,0 is given from the expansion
of the initial data f ε

Moreover, substituting the Hilbert expansion to Eε in the Poisson equation in (7), gives that

in in (11).

E0 = EF := −∇φF with

Now, the goal is to ﬁnd the equation satisﬁed by F , hence we turn to (26) and ﬁrst set

∆φF = ρF = 2πZR+×R

F w dwdvk.

(28)

G(t, x, w, vk) := w ∇x⊥F − ∇x⊥φF

Then we prove the following Proposition.

Proposition 4.2. Assume that b satisﬁes (5)-(6) and consider (F, EF ) the leading order of the
Hilbert expansion (10). Then equation (26) admits a solution f1 if and only if F satisﬁes the
solvability condition

Moreover, if this condition is satisﬁed, then there exists a function P ∈ ker L such that

f1(t, x, v) = − 1

b(t,x⊥) eθ · G(t, x, r, vk) + P (t, x, r, vk),




with eθ = (− sin θ, cos θ)t, φP satisﬁes the Poisson equation (16) and at time t = 0, we have
P (0) = Πf1(0, x, v).

Proof. Thanks to the deﬁnition of G, we write (26) as

Lf1 = ew · G(t, x, w, vk) + vk

∂F
∂xk

−

∂φF

.

On the one hand, we require that the solvability condition of (26) is well satisﬁed

Π Lf1 = 0.

Since Πew = 0, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the solvability of (26) is that F satisﬁes the
following condition

vk

∂F

−

∂φF

which corresponds to the constraint equation in (14).

On the other hand, assuming that this solvability condition is veriﬁed, we can explicitly solve
(26) by integration with respect to θ ∈ [0, 2π]. Then there exists a function P ∈ ker L such that
for any (t, x, v) ∈ R+ × R3 × R3,

f1(t, x, v) = −

1

b(t, x⊥)

eθ · G(t, x, w, vk) + P (t, x, w, vk),

where Πeθ = 0 and from the initial condition (11), it gives that

P (0) = Πfin,1.

Finally, substituting the Hilbert expansion to Eε in the Poisson equation in (7) and using that

we observe that

Πf1 =

1
b

Πeθ · G + ΠP = ΠP,

ρ1 = ZR3

f1dv = 2πZR+×R

P w dwdvk,

which gives that E1 = EP := −∇φP with φP solution to the Poisson equation

−∆φP = ρF = 2πZR+×R

P w dwdvk.

(cid:3)

Note that f1 depends now on the whole variable (x, v) ∈ R3 × R3. Finally, the equation satisﬁed

by F now appears as the solvability condition of (27).

Proposition 4.3. Assume that b satisﬁes (5)-(6) and consider (F, EF ) the leading order of the
Hilbert expansion (10). Then, equation (27) admits a solution f2 if and only if F satisﬁes the ﬁrst
equation in (14), that is,

Let us compute explicitly each term with respect to (F, EF ) and (P, EP ) given from the previous

analysis.

On the one hand, since the distribution function F does not depend on the angular velocity, we

have that

the solution f2 only depends on (F, EF ) and (P, EP ) and a function R ∈ ker L.

5. Open problems and conclusion

In this paper we studied the long time behavior of the solution to the Vlasov-Poisson system
(7) with a strong external magnetic ﬁeld Bext = (0, 0, b). We provide a formal analysis based on a
Hilbert type expansion of the solution and the formal limit is solution to a reduced kinetic model
(14) where the solution does not depend anymore on the angular perpendicular velocity θ ∈ (0, 2π).
As fas as we know, this reduced model is new and satisﬁes some fundamental properties as the
correct drift velocities E × Bext, gradient B-drift, conservation of energy, entropy, and invariance of
the magnetic moment. Thus, the reduced model (14) seems to be completely relevant and certainly
deserves more attention. In particular several important questions remain open.

About the generalization to an arbitrary external magnetic ﬁeld. Here we focus on the
formal analysis when the magnetic ﬁeld only applies in the z-direction. We may also consider an
arbitrary external magnetic ﬁeld Bext in order to get a more elaborated limiting system taking into
account curvature drift, polarization eﬀects, etc. This can be done by following the guideline of the
analysis performed in [4].

About the rigorous justiﬁcation of the limiting system. To justify our asymptotic analysis,
we should consider a smooth solution to the Vlasov-Poisson system (7), and should assume that
c × Ck+3 and
the limiting system also admits a smooth solution : for any k ≥ 0, (F, EF ) ∈ Ck+3
(P, EP ) ∈ Ck+2
c the
sub-space of Ck with compactly supported functions.

c × Ck+2, where Ck is the space of functions with k continuous derivatives and Ck

Then, we construct (F ε, Eε) by

F ε = F + ε f1 + ε2 f2, Eε = EF + ε EP ,

where f1 and f2 are solutions to (26) and (27), and f2 such that Πf2 = 0. Therefore (F ε, Eε) ∈
Ck+1
c × Ck+1 satisﬁes the Vlasov-Poisson system (7) with a source term (Rε)ε>0

+ + v · ∇xf2 + Eε · ∇vf2(cid:19) ,

+ EP · ∇vf1(cid:19) + ε2 (cid:18) ∂f2

∂t

The second step is to establish a comparison principle on the Vlasov-Poisson system (7) to prove
the convergence

kF ε − f εkH k ≤ C kRεkH k .

About existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions to the limiting system (14).
The lack of estimates on the Lagrange multiplier (P, EP ) is the main issue to prove existence of weak
solutions. Unfortunately, the constraint introduced in the limiting system (14) is not standard in
kinetic theory and ﬂuid mechanics since the constraint is nonlinear in the sense that the diﬀerential
operator TF applied to P depends on the solution itself via the potential φF

TF P := vk

∂P
∂xk

−

∂φF

Therefore, we cannot simply eliminate the constraint by introducing an appropriate functional
space. New estimates have to be established to ﬁx this issue.

is very unusual and may be very strong. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the limiting system
(14) can describe accurately plasma turbulence from current and spatial gradients and a stability
analysis of the particular solutions may be investigated. For instance, consider the limiting system
(14) , with b = 1 and periodic boundary conditions in space with an external background ρε
0 in the
Poisson equation

F dv − ρ0, with ρ0 =

F (0)dv dx.

∂G
∂t

+ U⊥ · ∇x⊥G = 0,

with U⊥ = −∇⊥φF and M is an arbitrary smooth and nonnegative function. Thus, we set
(P, EP ) = (0, 0) and since (F, EF ) does not depend on xk, the constraint in (14) is automatically
satisﬁed and (F, EF ) is solution to (14). An interesting question is the stability of such a solution.

About the numerical simulation of (14). Finally the numerical approximation of the limiting
system (14) should be investigated to study the relevance of such a model. This system has a clear
advantage from a numerical point of view since the stiﬀness due to the external magnetic ﬁeld of
the Vlasov-Poisson system (7) has been removed and the fast variable θ ∈ (0, 2π) is eliminated by
averaging. However, the discretization of (14) is not straightforward due to the constraint in the
parallel direction to the magnetic ﬁeld and a speciﬁc investigation have to be done. One possibility
is to follow the strategy applied in ﬂuid mechanics for the two dimensional incompressible Euler
system [37].
