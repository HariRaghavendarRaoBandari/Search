ABSTRACT

We present the analysis of the planetary microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1760,
which shows a strong light curve signal due to the presence of a Jupiter mass-ratio
planet. One unusual feature of this event is that the source star is quite blue, with
V − I = 1.48 ± 0.08. This is marginally consistent with source star in the Galactic
bulge, but it could possibly indicate a young source star in the far side of the disk.
Assuming a bulge source, we perform a Bayesian analysis assuming a standard Galactic
model, and this indicates that the planetary system resides in or near the Galactic bulge

at DL = 6.9±1.1 kpc. It also indicates a host star mass of M∗ = 0.51±0.44M(cid:12), a planet
mass of mp = 180±110M⊕, and a projected star-planet separation of a⊥ = 1.7±0.3 AU.
The lens-source relative proper motion is µrel = 6.5 ± 1.1 mas/yr. The lens (and stellar
host star) is predicted to be very faint, so it is most likely that it can detected only
when the lens and source stars are partially resolved. Due to the relatively high relative
proper motion, the lens and source will be resolved to about ∼ 46 mas in 6-8 years after
the peak magniﬁcation. So, by 2020 - 2022, we can hope to detect the lens star with
deep, high resolution images.

Introduction

Gravitational Microlensing is the technique of detecting exoplanets using gravitational lensing.
Microlensing is unique in its ability to detect planets (Gould & Loeb 1992) just outside of the snow
line (Lissauer 1993) down to an earth mass (Bennett & Rhie 1996), which is diﬃcult or impossible
with other methods. According to the core accretion theory, the snow line (Ida & Lin 2005; Lecar
et. al. 2006; Kennedy et. al. 2006; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995) plays a very crucial role in the
planet formation process. Beyond the snow line, ices condense, increasing the density of the solid
materials. Higher density of solids speeds the planet formation process in the protoplanetary disk,
hence forming cold planets quickly beyond the snow line. The planets, discovered by microlensing,
provide the statistics needed to understand the architecture of cold planets beyond the snow line
(Suzuki et al. 2016). Since this method does not rely on the light from the host stars, it can
detect planets, even when the host stars cannot be detected (Mao & Paczy´nski 1991). Most of
the planets discovered so far using microlensing are ∼ 1-8 kpc away. Thus, microlensing is able
to detect planets in the inner Galactic disk and bulge, where it is diﬃcult to detect planets with
other methods. Thus, microlensing has the potential to measure how the properties of exoplanets
depend on the Galactic environment.

For most planetary microlensing events, the angular Einstein radius, θE is measured from
the ﬁnite source eﬀect.
In events where the lens star brightness (Bennett et al. 2006) or the
parallax eﬀect is measured (Gould 1992; Gaudi et al. 2008; Muraki et al. 2011), the planetary
mass and distance to the planetary system can be determined . Hence this technique can be
used to build statistics of planetary mass as a function of the host star mass. Since the planets
detected by microlensing are ∼ 1-8 kpc away, the distance to the planetary system will also allow
the determination of the planetary mass function as a function of the distance towards the galactic
center.

In this paper we present the discovery of a gas giant planet orbiting the lens stars for mi-
crolensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1760. The mass ratio of this planet is q = 8.64 × 10−4, which is
slightly less than that of Jupiter. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the light

– 4 –

curve data collected for the event OGLE-2014-BLG-1760. The next section (Section 3) is divided in
four parts: 3.1 summarizes data reduction procedures for the diﬀerent data sets; Section 3.2 shows
the best ﬁt model and procedures that are used to obtain it; Section 3.3 describes how the limb
darkening of the source is modeled; and section 3.4 presents our attempt to detect the microlensing
parallax eﬀect in the light curve. In Section 4, we discuss source brightness and angular radius
measurement and derive the lens-source relative proper motion. Section 5 discusses an estimate of
the lens properties and the future possible investigations.

2. Observation

The OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) collaboration operates a microlensing
survey towards the galactic bulge, with the 1.3 meter Warsaw telescope from Las Campanas obser-
vatory in Chile. Most of the OGLE-IV (phase 4) observations were taken in the Cousins I-band,
with occasional observations in Johnson V -band (Udalski et al. 2015). In the year 2014, OGLE
Early Warning System (EWS) (Udalski et al. 1994) has alerted 2049 microlensing candidates of
which this event OGLE-2014-BLG-1760 was the 1760th one.

The MOA (Microlensing Observation in Astrophysics) (Bond et al. 2001) collaboration also
operates a microlensing survey towards the galactic bulge with the 1.8 meter MOA-II telescope
from Mount John Observatory at Lake Tekapo, New Zealand. The observations are mostly taken
in MOA-red wide band ﬁlter which covers the wavelengths of the standard Cousins R + I bands.
For year 2014, MOA has reported about ∼33 microlensing anomalies out of which OGLE-2014-
BLG-1760 planetary event is one of them.

Both of these telescopes have relatively large ﬁelds-of-view, 2.2 deg2 for MOA-II, and 1.4 deg2
for OGLE-IV. These enable survey observations with cadences as high as one observation every
15 minutes, and this allows the surveys to detect the sharp light curve features of planetary light
curve features, when they are only smoothed by the ﬁnite source eﬀects of a main sequence source
star. It is the high cadence observation of microlensing events of MOA-II and OGLE-IV survey
that helps in detecting microlensing anomalies, including the microlensing planetary signatures.

The microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1760 was discovered at (RA,decl.)(2000) = (17 : 57 :
38.16,−28 : 57 : 47.37)[(l,b)=(1.3186,−2.2746)], by the OGLE EWS on August 22, 2014 around
7.25 a.m. EDT. The same event was alerted by MOA on August 31, 2014 as MOA-2014-BLG-547.
Later, on September 10, 2014, the MOA collaboration detected the planetary cusp crossing and
announced the anomaly in the light curve (around HJD = 2456911 in Figure 1). In response to
MOA anomaly alert, the follow up groups Robonet and µFUN started collecting data on this event.
The high cadence observation of MOA-II survey covered most of the cusp crossing, and the trough
after the cusp crossing was well covered by follow up groups, Robonet and µFUN. The Robonet
group observed the event with 1 m robotic telescopes at Cape Town, South Africa and at Siding
Springs, Australia, in the Sloan I-band. The µFUN group also observed the event with the 1.3 m

– 5 –

SMARTS CTIO telescopes in both the V and I-bands. All these observations are shown in Figure
1. Although the µFUN data is pretty ﬂat because the trough is followed by the normal single
lens decrease ( see Figure 1), the µFUN data do help to exclude the wide model with s = 1.27
and contribute in constraining the planetary model ( discussed in section 3.2). It is true that the
constraint from the Robonet and OGLE data is stronger because of better Robonet coverage and
OGLE observations over a wider range of magniﬁcations.

3. Data Reduction and Modeling

3.1. Data Reduction

All the images were reduced to photometry using the diﬀerence image method (Tomany &
Crotts 1996; Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard 2000). The MOA images were reduced using MOA
diﬀerence image analysis pipeline (Bond et al. (2001)). The data was then detrended using the
non-2014 data to minimize the error due to the eﬀects of diﬀerential refraction, seeing and airmass.
To avoid systematic errors due to ﬂat ﬁeld changes and changes in detector sensitivity, we removed
data prior to 2011 and only use the data after HJD(cid:48) = 5596 (February, 2011) for modeling. OGLE
data were reduced using OGLE Diﬀerence Image Analysis software and optimal centroid method
(Udalski (2003); Wozniak (2000)). The µFUN photometry was produced using a modiﬁed version
of the PySIS package (Albrow et. al. 2009). Robonet data were reduced using the DanDIA package
Bramich (2008).

i + e2

The error bar estimates obtained from the photometry codes are suﬃcient to ﬁnd the best ﬁt
model. These error bar estimates are good measures of the relative uncertainties for measurements
with the same telescope, but they are often wrong by a factor of ∼2. To determine the uncertainties
for the model parameters, it is necessary to have accurate error bars which will give χ2/dof ≈ 1
for each passband. We used method of Bennett et al. (2014) to normalize the error bars using
σ(cid:48)
i = k
i is the modiﬁed error
bar. A k value is selected for each passband to give χ2/dof = 1. Our initial ﬁts used k = 1.50
and emin = 0.003 for all passbands. Next, once the best ﬁt model was found, the values of k
was modiﬁed for each passband to satisfy χ2/dof = 1. The number of datapoints used for each
passband and their corresponding k values are listed in Table 1. New ﬁts were done with the new
error bars, which resulted in very small changes to the model parameters.

3.2. Best Fit Model

We begin our modeling of the OGLE-2014-BLG-1760 light curve with single lens microlensing
model (Paczy´nski 1986). There are three non-linear model parameters for a single lens event: t0 -
the time of peak magniﬁcation, u0 - the minimum separation between source and lens in Einstein

best ﬁt single lens model and the dark grey line represents the best planetary model. The data are
plotted in the following colors: red for the MOA-red band, black for OGLE-I, purple for OGLE-V ,
(diﬃcult to see due to overlap with the OGLE-I data), blue for the ROBONET SAAO-A I-band,
gold for the ROBONET SAAO-B I-band, green for the ROBONET Siding Springs-A I-band, cyan
for the ROBONET Siding Springs-B I-band, and magenta for the µFUN I-band.

Fig. 2.— This ﬁgure shows the caustic conﬁguration and source trajectory for the best ﬁt planetary
model. When the source crosses inside the planetary caustic, its magniﬁcation jumps as two new
highly magniﬁed images are created, and then the magniﬁcation drops just as abruptly when the
source exits and two images disappear. The two caustic crossings are at HJD(cid:48) − 2450000 = 6911.00
and 6911.07. Since the interval between the caustic crossings is similar to the source radius crossing
time, t∗, the two magniﬁcation peaks merge into one peak, as shown in Figure 1 at HJD(cid:48) ∼ 6911.
Also, when the source passes between the two minor image planetary caustics, the magniﬁcation of
the source brightness drops, as can be seen in the light curve after caustic crossing, between HJD(cid:48)
= 6911.20 and 6914.00 in Figure 1.

radius units, and tE - the Einstein radius crossing time. There are also two linear parameters for
each passband: the source ﬂux fs, and the blend ﬂux, fbl. We ﬁnd the best single lens parameters
as the starting point for a systematic search through parameter space to ﬁnd the best binary lens
solution. Because the light curve follows a single lens shape for most of its history, except in the
vicinity of the planetary feature at t ≈ 6911, we can use the best ﬁt single lens parameters as the
starting point for an initial condition grid search, following Bennett (2010).

To describe a binary lens, we need three additional parameters: the lens mass ratio, q, the
projected separation between the lens masses, s, measured in Einstein radius units, and the angle
between the source trajectory and the lens axis, θ. Also, binary events often have caustic or cusp
crossings, which resolve the angular size of the source, so we need an additional parameter, the
source radius crossing time, t∗, to model ﬁnite source eﬀects. With the single lens parameters ﬁxed
to the best ﬁt values, we using the initial condition grid search method to search over the parameter
ranges 0.48 ≤ s ≤ 2.10, −4 ≤ log q ≤ −2, and −π ≤ θ ≤ π, with t∗ ﬁxed at t∗ = 0.05. We then
select ∼ 10 of the best ﬁt values from the initial condition grid search (with very diﬀerent values of
q, s and θ) to use as initial conditions for full, non-linear modeling runs using the Bennett (2010)
χ2 minimization recipe, which is a modiﬁcation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Verde et
al. 2003). The parameters of the best ﬁt binary lens model and the χ2 improvement are compared
with the best ﬁt single lens model in Table 2. The binary lens best ﬁt model has q = 8.64 × 10−4
improves the renormalized χ2 by ∆χ2 = 1218.75 compared to the best ﬁt single lens model. Hence
the binary lens model is the preferred model.

High magniﬁcation planetary microlensing events usually have a “close-wide” degeneracy, in

that solutions with s ↔ 1/s are nearly degenerate. This is usually not the case for low magniﬁcation
planetary events because the caustic structure for the major and minor image caustics is quite
diﬀerent. However, the major and minor image caustics with s ↔ 1/s are encountered at the same
single lens magniﬁcation, and with speciﬁc source trajectories, it is possible to produce similar
light curves with both s > 1 and s < 1, particularly if the light curves aren’t very well sampled.
Therefore, we have searched for models with s ∼ 1/0.83 = 1.20. We found a best ﬁt s > 1 model
with s = 1.27, but this is a worse ﬁt than the best ﬁt model (with s = 0.83) by ∆χ2 ∼ 215. This
is because the OGLE-2014-BLG-1760 is well sampled, so the s = 1.27 model is excluded, and the
s = 0.83 is the only viable solution.

3.3. Limb Darkening Eﬀect

The photometric calibrations and the extinction toward the red clump stars in the vicinity of
the source are discussed in Section 4. The magnitude and color of the source are indicated with
the cyan point in Figure 4, and the extinction corrected color is (V − I)S,0 = 0.34, as discussed in
section 4. This color implies that the source is an ∼A9 star with Teﬀ ∼ 7352 K from Kenyon &
Hartmann (1995). We use a linear limb darkening model, and from Claret (2000), we select the limb
darkening parameters u to be 0.4204, 0.5790 and 0.46035 corresponding to the V , I and MOA-Red
bands, respectively. These corresponds to the temperature of Teﬀ = 7352 K and a surface gravity
of log g = 4.5. The parameters of the best ﬁt model are insensitive to the precise limit darkening
parameters.

3.4. Search for a Microlensing Parallax Signal

The microlensing parallax eﬀect has been detected in a number of planetary microlensing events
(Gaudi et al. 2008; Bennett et al. 2010; Muraki et al. 2011) where it has allowed the lens system
masses to be measured. Due to the Earth’s orbital motion about the Sun, the apparent lens - source
relative motion deviates from uniform linear motion. This phenomenon is known as microlensing
parallax eﬀect (Gould 1992; Alcock et. al. 1995). The parallax eﬀect can be described with the
parallax vector πE = (πE,N , πE,E), where direction of πE is same as lens-source relative proper
motion, µrel. The amplitude of πE is the inverse of the Einstein radius projected to the observer’s
plane, πE = AU/˜rE. When both the microlensing parallax eﬀect and the angular Einstein radius
(as described in section 4) are measured, we can determine the lens system mass and distance from
the following equations:

ML =

– 10 –

where k = 4G/(c2AU) = 8.14 mas M−1(cid:12) , ML is the total mass of host star and planet and DL and
DS ∼ 8 kpc are the distances to the lens system and source stars, respectively. The host star mass,
M∗, is given by M∗ = ML/(1 + q).

In order to include the microlensing parallax eﬀect, we must add two new model parameters πE
and φE, the magnitude and direction angle of the parallax vector. (The north and east components
of πE are given by πE,N = πE cos(φE) and πE,E = πE sin(φE).) Our best ﬁt parallax model has an
unusually large πE value of πE = 5.86, which would imply a very nearby and low mass lens if it is
an accurate measurement, but the improvement in χ2 is only ∆χ2 = 9.90 over the best ﬁt without
parallax. We can examine the origins of this parallax signal by examining the cumulative ∆χ2
between the non-parallax and parallax models as a function of time, which we show in Figure 3.
The cumulative ∆χ2 is displayed for the MOA and OGLE data separately, and we can see that
only the OGLE data favors the parallax model. Penny et al. (2016) consider the distribution of
published planetary microlensing events and show the there an implausibly large number with
>∼ 1). This suggests that some of the published planetary
“high” microlensing parallax values (πE
events have spurious large πE values (Han et al. 2016). We conclude that this microlensing parallax
measurement for OGLE-2014-BLG-1760 is also spurious.

4. Calibration and Source Properties

The OGLE data were taken in the OGLE-IV I and V -bands, which we calibrate to the OGLE-
III catalog Cousins I and Johnson V band (Szyma´nski et al. 2010). 151 bright (I ≤ 16.50)
and isolated stars were matched in both passbands and used for this calibration. The following
calibration relations are used to convert OGLE V I magnitudes to OGLE III Catalog Cousins I
and Johnson V magnitude:

Fig. 3.— The diﬀerence in the cumulative χ2 values between the best ﬁt models with and without
parallax are shown for MOA data (blue), OGLE data (red) and total MOA + OGLE data (black).
The negative cumulative ∆χ2 means parallax model is supported. Also MOA data does not support
parallax whereas OGLE data supports parallax model. The χ2 improvement from MOA + OGLE
data for parallax model is ∼ 3.60. The overall χ2 improvement for parallax model from all the
telescopes is ∼ 9.90. Hence the parallax signal is dubious and probably a false signal.

The uncertainty in the brightness due to these calibration relations is ∼ 0.01 magnitude. The
source brightness in the OGLE III catalog scale is IS = 19.07± 0.14 , VS = 20.51± 0.26. The errors
in brightness are calculated from MCMC averages over all the MCMC ﬁts and from the uncertainty
in the calibration relations.

(3)

There is a single magniﬁed OGLE V -band observation at t = 6896.50 (HJD(cid:48)), and this results
in a relatively large, 10% uncertainty in the V -band source ﬂux for the best ﬁt model. As a result,
the OGLE V I source colors given a source star color of V − I = 1.45 ± 0.11. The color of the
source star is bluer than the average main sequence star color as can be seen in ﬁgure 4. Because
we have only this single V -band measurement, we also calculate the source star color from MOA-
Red and OGLE-I band following Gould et al. (2010a) and Bennett et al. (2012). Since we have a
large number of MOA-Red and OGLE-I observations when the source is signiﬁcantly magniﬁed,
we expect a robust measurement of the RMOA − I source color. About 140 bright, isolated stars
with I-band magnitude I < 16 and 1.0 < V − I < 2.6 are matched between the MOA-II and OGLE
III reference images, and we used these to ﬁnd the following calibration relation:

RMOA − IOGLEIII = 0.18143 × (V − I)OGLEIII ,

where the RMOA passband has been calibrated to give RMOA = IOGLEIII when (V − I)OGLEIII = 0.
The RMS error for this calibration relation is 0.0343, for a formal uncertainty of 0.0343/
N =
0.0029, but we assume a calibration uncertainty of 0.02 for RMOA − IOGLEIII.

√

Our models give a source brightnesses of IS = 19.07 ± 0.14 and RMOA,S = 19.34 ± 0.15 and a
calibrated source color of V − I = 1.52 ± 0.11. This color is less than 1-σ away from the color of
the source derived from OGLE V -band data, so we conclude that the blue color from the OGLE
data is probably real. However, the average color from both measurements is V − I = 1.48 ± 0.08,
which still has a relatively large error bar. We take this average as the correct color of the source.
This color is plotted in blue point in the color magnitude diagram of all stars within 140(cid:48)(cid:48) of the
source star, Figure 4. The green points in the CMD ﬁgure 4 show the HST CMD plot (Holtzman et
al. 1998) shifted to have the same red clump centroid position as the OGLE-III stars . The source
color is slightly bluer than the main sequence star distribution shown with green points in the HST
CMD in ﬁgure 4. The average color of main sequence bulge stars in the same magnitude range of
the source (I = 19.07± 0.14) in in the HST CMD is V − I = 1.75. We can estimate the probability
that a star with the measured color of the source (V − I = 1.48 ± 0.08) is drawn from this HST
distribution by integrating the Gaussian describing the measured source color with its error bar
over the distribution of stars in the same magnitude range from the HST CMD. We then divide
this result by the result of the integral with the same error bar, but centered on the average color
of V − I = 1.75. The ratio of integral centered on the measured color and the integral centered on

centroid, and the cyan spot indicates the source magnitude and color with error bars. The green
points show HST CMD of Baade’s window transformed to have the same red clump centroid as this
ﬁeld. The source star is slightly bluer than the HST main sequence stars. This might be explained
by a young, blue source in the Milky Way disk on the far side of the bulge.

the average color is 0.05, indicating that this source color is marginally consistent with being drawn
from the known bulge star population. With nearly, 50 planetary microlensing events published to
date, we would expect one or two to be found with such a blue source star. On the other hand, it
is also possible that blue stars are preferentially lensed because they are at a greater distance. This
can be the case if the source is a young blue (late A or early F) star on the far side of the Galactic
disk, assuming negligible extinction beyond the bulge on this line-of-sight. Such stars would have
a much larger microlensing event rate, so they could be preferentially lensed by bulge stars. On
the other hand, it is possible that the CMD in this ﬁeld is noticeably diﬀerent than that of Baade’s
window where the Holtzman et al. (1998) image was taken.

We calculate the extinction in the direction of the source using the method described by
Bennett et al. (2014). The position of the centroid of red clump in the OGLE III catalog is found
to be (V − I, I)RC = (2.20, 15.84) as shown in ﬁgure 4. From Bensby et al. (2011) and Nataf et al.
(2013), the dereddened red clump centroid is determined to be (V − I, I)RC = (1.06, 14.39). Hence,
the extinction at this galactic coordinate is : (E(V − I), AI )RC = (1.14, 1.45). The extinction to
the source star is assumed to be same as the average extinction for the red clump stars within 140(cid:48)(cid:48)
since most of the extinction is thought to be in the foreground. Thus, the extinction corrected
source color and brightness are (V − I, I)S,0 = (0.34, 17.62), as shown in blue in ﬁgure 4.

The source radius is calculated from the dereddened source magnitude and color using the

following formula, obtained from a private communication with Tabetha Boyajian:

log10(2θ∗) = 0.50141358 + 0.41968496(V − I) − 0.2I

(5)
For the source color or V − I = 1.48, the calculated source radius is θ∗ = (6.57 ± 0.11) × 10−4
mas. The relative proper motion and Einstein radius are calculated from:

µrel =

θ∗
t(cid:63)
θE = θ∗ × tE
t(cid:63)

Since the best ﬁt model has tE = 15.87 days and t∗ = 0.04 days, we ﬁnd:

µrel = 6.55 ± 1.12 mas/yr
θE = 0.29 ± 0.05 mas .

There is a 5% uncertainty in source radius relation (equation 5). We assume 1-2% error in the
calibration relations (equations 3 and 4).

5. Lens Properties and Discussion

If we assume a standard Galactic model (Bennett et al. 2014) with a source star in the bulge
and we assume that all stars and brown dwarf have an equal probability of hosting a planet with

– 15 –

the measured properties, then we can perform a Bayesian analysis to estimate the lens system
properties. We ran an MCMC run with about 180,000 links to obtain the posterior distributions
presented in Table 3 and Figure 5. The mass of the host star is only approximately determined
to be M∗ = 0.51 +0.44−0.28 M(cid:12), so it could be an M, K, or G star. The 1-sigma range of the planet
mass, mp = 182 +137−83 spans the range from the mass of Saturn to that of Jupiter. The distance to
the lens system is more precisely determined, due to the relatively small angular Einstein radius,
θE = 0.29 ± 0.05 mas. Our analysis predicts a lens system distance of DL = 6.86 ± 1.11 . This
implies that the lens system is very likely to be in the Galactic bulge.

Penny et al. (2016) argue that the published planetary microlensing events show a dearth of
planets orbiting Galactic bulge stars. This OGLE-2014-BLG-1760L lens system would seem to be
a counterexample, along with a number of other planetary microlens systems, such as OGLE-2005-
BLG-380L (Beaulieu et al. 2006), OGLE-2008-BLG-092L (Poleski et al. 2014), MOA-2008-BLG-
310L (Janczak et al. 2010), OGLE-2008-BLG-355L (Koshimoto et al. 2014), MOA-2011-BLG-353L
(Rattenbury et al. 2015) and MOA-2011-BLG-293L (Yee et al. 2012; Batista et al. 2014). Actually,
the problem with the Penny et al. (2016) analysis is pretty easy to understand. The Einstein radius
crossing times (tE) for bulge events are signiﬁcantly smaller than the tE values for disk events, but
the detection eﬃciencies for microlensing events and planetary signals are substantially higher for
events with large tE values. The statistical analysis of Suzuki et al. (2016) shows that the planet
detection eﬃciency weighted median tE value is ≈ 42 days. This eﬀect occurs for high magniﬁcation
events (Gould et al. 2010b) because high magniﬁcation is much easier to predict when tE is large,
and for low magniﬁcation events (Suzuki et al. 2016) because the planetary signal duration (for
ﬁxed q) is proportional to tE. This eﬀect can be accounted for with accurate detection eﬃciency
calculations, but Penny et al. (2016) use a detection eﬃciency calculation for an advance ground-
based survey, that is much more sensitive than any ground-based survey undertaken to date. One
of us (Bennett 2004) has previously studied a variety of ground-based microlensing surveys with
a wide range of telescope options, and these simulations show that this detection eﬃciency bias

with tE is much stronger with the less capable surveys that can approximate the sensitivity of the
observing programs that have discovered the published events.

It should also be noted that the color of the source star V − I = 1.48 ± 0.08 implies that this
star is bluer than and only marginally consistent with bulge main sequence shown in Figure 4. This
source star could be a ”blue straggler” which is an old, bright blue star that probably formed from
a merger of two smaller stars, but these stars are rare, or it could be that this ﬁeld has a larger
fraction of bluer, metal poor stars than the HST Baade’s window stars plotted in Figure 4. But
this also seems unlikely. Another possibility is that this star is a relatively young blue star that
resides in the Galactic disk on the far side of the bulge with minimal additional extinction between
the bulge and this source star. If so, HST observations taken separated by 2 years could reveal the
characteristic source star proper motion of a far side disk star. Since the galactic coordinates of the
source, (l, b) = 1.3186,−2.2746 are pretty close to the nominal WFIRST exoplanet microlensing
survey ﬁelds (Spergel et al. 2015) ﬁeld, so understanding the source distance distribution in this
area of the bulge is important for WFIRST.

The probability distribution for the brightness of the lens star in I and H-bands is shown in
Figure 6. The blend magnitude from best ﬁt is found Ibl = 17.94 which is brighter than the lens
star magnitude predicted in Table 3 and Figure 6. Since the lens-source relative proper motion
is µrel = 6.55 ± 1.12 mas/yr, the source and lens will be separated by ∼ 1 HST pixel (39.6 ± 6.2)
by 2020.
If the lens system is observed directly in high resolution images, then the brightness
measurement of lens leads to the precise calculation of the mass and distance to the lens system
(Bennett et al. 2006, 2015; Batista et al. 2015). But in the I-band, the source star is brighter than
the median prediction for the lens by ∼ 4 magnitudes (see Figure 6), which makes it diﬃcult to
observe the lens in I band with the high resolution follow-up images unless the lens and source are
completely resolved. The extinction corrected (I − H) color of the source is obtained from (V − I)
color using Kenyon & Hartmann (1995). The H-band extinction AH is also obtained from AI and
AV using the Cardelli et al. (1989) formula. From the I-band magnitude, the (I − H) color and the
H-band extinction, AH , the H-band magnitude of the source is calculated to be HS = 17.96. From
Figure 6, we see that the H-band magnitudes of source and median prediction for the lens diﬀer by
∼ 2.0-2.5 magnitude. The uncertainty in the source brightness is measured from the Markov chain
links. We also include the uncertainty in the source color and magnitude. There is 5% uncertainty
in the color conversion from the extinction corrected (V − I) to (I − H). The red lines in Figure 6
is such that if lens is at least as bright as the red lines (i.e. it lies in the red-shaded region) then
lens+source brightness is brighter than the 3-σ upper limit on the source brightness. This would
mean that the lens could be detected when it is still unresolved from the source. Since most of the
lens ﬂux histogram lies to the right of the red-shaded region, the lens is likely to be too faint to be
detected in high resolution images unless lens and source are partially resolved. Since the relative
lens-source proper motion, µrel ∼ 6.5 mas/yr, the lens and source are expected to be resolvable by
JWST, HST or adaptive optics imaging some in 6-8 years after peak magniﬁcation, in 2020 - 2022.

grey. The blue lines indicate the source magnitude, and the left and right panels show the I and H
magnitude distributions, respectively. The vertical red lines mark the lens brightness corresponding
to the 3-σ upper limit on the source brightness, so if the lens is in the light red shaded region it
will be bright enough to push the combined lens+source brightness above the brightness from the
light curve models. In this case, the excess brightness from the lens will be detectable even when
the lens and source remain unresolved. If the lens is fainter and located to the right of the red
shaded region, we will not be able to identify the lens with high angular resolution JWST, HST or
adaptive optics observations until the lens star begins to separate from the source 5-8 years after
peak magniﬁcation.

data, and discovered a break in the mass ratio function at q ∼ 10−4. The OGLE-2014-BLG-1760Lb
planetary mass ratio of q = 8.6 ± 0.9 is above the mass ratio break qbr ∼ 10−4. This is close to
Jupiter’s mass ratio, but the host star probably has a mass of M∗ <∼ M(cid:12), so this planet is probably
a low-mass gas giant, like Saturn. Follow up observations with JWST, HST or adaptive optics in
2020-2022 should be able to measure the lens brightness and determine the planetary mass and
distance using the methods of Bennett et al. (2006, 2007, 2015) and Batista et al. (2015). Later
with WFIRST (Spergel et al. 2015), a similar kind of study will provide the statistics needed to
determine the planetary mass function as a function of the host star mass and distance.
