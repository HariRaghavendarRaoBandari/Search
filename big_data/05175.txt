Theoretical calculations predicted that bulk ZrTe5 to be either a weak or a strong topological
insulator. However, the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurements
clearly demonstrate three-dimensional (3D) Dirac cone state with a small mass gap between the
valence band and conduction band. From the magnetization and magneto-transport measurements
on ZrTe5 single crystal, we have detected both the signature of helical spin texture from topological
surface state and chiral anomaly associated with the three-dimensional Dirac cone state in the bulk.
This conﬁrms that ZrTe5 is a novel 3D topological insulator having Dirac fermionic excitation in
it’s bulk insulating state. Also, from the resistivity and Hall measurements, it is apparent that
the anomalous peak in the resistivity can be shifted to a much lower temperature (T <2 K) by
controlling impurity and defects.

The

low-dimensional pentatellurides, ZrTe5

and
HfTe5, synthesized in 1973 [1], exhibit a peak in the
resistivity (ρ) as a function of temperature [2]. This
anomaly in the resistivity has been observed at TP ∼
145 K for ZrTe5 and TP ∼ 80 K for HfTe5, however,
the exact temperature varies from sample to sample
depending on the impurity level [3]. Recent works on
ZrTe5 reported TP as low as ∼60 K, which has been
ascribed to very low defect and impurity concentration
in the samples [4, 5]. Most of the earlier works have been
directed towards understanding the origin of this peak.
The charge carrier switches from holes at T >TP to elec-
trons for T <TP , which is reﬂected in the sign change of
thermoelectric power [6] and Hall coeﬃcient [7]. Initially,
it was believed that this resistive anomaly arises due to
a charge-density wave transition, similar to that occurs
in NbSe3 [8]. But the absence of lattice modulation,
ohmic resistivity at high electric ﬁeld and the angular
dependence of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility
eliminate the idea of charge density wave formation in
ZrTe5 [9]. Subsequently, the concept of possible pola-
ronic conduction [10], semimetal-semiconductor phase
transition [11], etc., have emerged until an extensive
theoretical work suggested that the single layer of ZrTe5
and HfTe5 crystal
is the most promising candidate
for the quantum spin Hall insulator due to the large
bulk gap [12]. Suddenly, a material known for its large
thermoelectric power [6], resistivity anomaly [1] and
large positive magnetoresistance [13], has been brought
to our attention to study the topological properties of
relativistic Dirac fermion in condensed matter physics
[4, 5, 14–21].
It has been established from recent
angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)
measurement that the temperature dependence of the
electronic band structure across the Fermi energy is
responsible for the anomalous peak in resistivity [14].
However, ZrTe5 is not free from debate, facing more
bigger question. Theoretical calculation shows that
electronic properties of bulk ZrTe5 is very sensitive to
the lattice parameters. Depending on the values of

lattice parameters it can be either a weak or a strong
topological insulator [12]. On the other hand, ARPES
[4, 14], infrared spectroscopy [5, 15] and magneto trans-
port [4] studies show three-dimensional linear dispersion
with a small semiconducting gap between valence and
conduction band, i.e., 3D Dirac fermionic excitation with
small mass gap. Do theory and experiment contradict
with each other or the topological Dirac fermions in the
surface and three-dimensional Dirac cone state in the
bulk can coexist simultaneously in ZrTe5? If the latter
is possible, it would be remarkable phenomenon. We
will have a three-dimensional topological insulator with
Dirac fermionic excitation in it’s bulk.

High quality single crystals of ZrTe5 were grown by
iodine vapor transport method similar to that reported
earlier[22]. A stoichiometric ratio of the Zr (Alfa Aesar
99.9%) and Te (Alfa Aesar 99.99%) were sealed in a
15 cm long Quartz tube with iodine (∼ 5 mg/cc) and
placed in a box furnace.
It was then heated for seven
days at 520◦C and cooled to room temperature at
10◦C/hour. Next, the tube was shifted to a two zone
gradient furnace. Reactants were placed at the hotter
end at 540◦C while the other end of the tube is placed
at the cooler end of the furnace at 450 ◦C to provide a
temperature gradient for four days. After slowly cooling
(∼30◦C/hour) it to room temperature, single crystals
with needlelike morphology were obtained at the cooler
end. Typical size and morphology of few representative
single crystals are shown in Fig. 1(a).

Phase purity and the structural analysis of the samples
were done by high resolution powder x-ray diﬀraction
(XRD) technique (Rigaku, TTRAX II) using Cu-Kα ra-
diation [23]. Within the resolution of XRD, we have not
seen any peak due to the impurity phase. The calculated
value of the lattice parameters are a=3.96 ˚A, b=14.50
˚A and c=13.78 ˚A with space group symmetry Cmcm,
similar to the earlier reports [24–26]. The structure of
the pentatellurides consists of trigonal prismatic chains of

in the temperature dependence of ρ, which is known as
the resistivity anomaly of ZrTe5 [1–5]. We have already
mentioned that the temperature at which ρ shows peak
varies widely; from 60 K to 170 K depending on the
presence of impurity and defect concentration in the
sample. It has also been argued that the binding energy
shift of valence and conduction bands as a function of
temperature is responsible for the peak at TP [14]. The
sign of the charge carrier changes from positive (hole)
to negative (electron) and the peak in ρ(T ) appears
when the chemical potential crosses the gap (∼50±10
meV) from valence band to conduction band. The
absence of resistivity peak down to 2 K in the present
sample could be attributed to larger bulk gap due to
much lower impurities and defects. Under application of
magnetic ﬁeld, ρ increases sharply at low temperature
and the metal-semiconductor crossover shifts to higher
temperature, which is consistent with the earlier reports
[4, 26].

To further ensure the absence of resistivity anomaly,
which has been ascribed to the switching of p-type
semimetal to n-type semimetal state, we have done Hall
measurements down to 2 K. Figure 2(a) shows that the
Hall resistance (RH ) remains positive over the entire
temperature range 2-300 K. The absence of sign change
in RH is consistent with the observed T dependence of ρ.
One can see that RH is linear over the entire ﬁeld range
except at low temperature, where an upward curvature
appears at high ﬁelds due to the Shubnikovde Haas os-
cillations. A systematic increase of the slope of the Hall
resistance with decreasing temperature is consistent with
the temperature evolution of electronic band structure
in ZrTe5 [14, 21]. From the slope of RH (H), the bulk
carrier density (n) is calculated to be ∼8.3×1015cm−3
and ∼1.45×1016cm−3 at 2 and 300 K, respectively. We
would like mention that the carrier density in the present
crystal is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than
the earlier reported ones [18, 27]. Figure 2(b) shows
the normalized magnetoresistance (MR) up to 9 T
magnetic ﬁeld. MR is large, positive and shows no sign
of saturation in the measured temperature and ﬁeld
range. The observed behavior of MR is similar to the
earlier reports [13, 16, 17]. At low temperature, the
MR is dominated by a very low frequency Shubnikovde
Haas oscillation, which implies the presence of a tiny
Fermi pocket, consistent with the low carrier density
determined from the Hall measurements.
At high
temperatures, where the quantum oscillation suppresses,
MR becomes linear.

As proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1929, the four com-
ponent massless Dirac equation in three spatial dimen-
sions can be separated into two two-component equa-
tions, ı ∂Ψ
trices and momentum respectively. The above equation
describes particles with a deﬁnite chirality (cid:126)σ.ˆp, known as
Weyl fermions. Also, according to the classical equation

∂t =±c(cid:126)σ.(cid:126)pΨ, where (cid:126)σ and (cid:126)p are the Pauli ma-

ZrTe3 along a-axis that linked via parallel zigzag chains
of Te atoms along the c-axis, which together form 2D
planes weakly bonded via van der Waals forces along
the b-axis [12]. Figure 1(b) shows the crystallographic
directions of a typical ZrTe5 single crystal. The resis-
tivity measurements were done by standard four-probe
technique. Electrical contacts were made using conduc-
tive silver paste. The electrical transport measurements
were carried out in a 9 T physical property measure-
ment system (Quantum Design) and Cryogen Free Mea-
surement System (CRYOGENIC). The magnetization
was measured using a Superconducting Quantum Inter-
ference Device having Vibrating Sample Magnetometer
(SQUID-VSM) (Quantum Design). Before the magne-
tization measurements, our system is standardized us-
ing single crystal of diamagnetic Bismuth (Alfa Aesar
99.99%) and standard paramagnetic palladium [23].

Resistivity and transverse magnetoresistance mea-
surements are done by applying current along the a
axis and magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the ac plane,
i.e., along b axis. Figure 1(c) shows the temperature
dependence of resistivity of ZrTe5 single crystal both in
presence and absence of magnetic ﬁeld. The zero-ﬁeld
ρ exhibits metallic behavior (dρ/dT >0) down to 25 K.
Below 25 K, ρ shows a weak upturn, i.e., a crossover
from metallic to semiconducting like behavior. However,
several earlier reports show that a broad peak appears

two Weyl nodes with opposite chirality, which induces a
charge pumping from one Weyl node to another. The
net current generation due to the chiral imbalance is
jc= e2B
4π2¯h2c (µR-µL) [4, 32]. Again, (µR-µL) is proportional
to (cid:126)E. (cid:126)B. As a result, the enhanced magneto-conductance
is expected to show quadratic B dependence. Thus,
the longitudinal magneto-conductance can be ﬁtted with
σc=σ0+aB2, where σ0 and a are the zero-ﬁeld conductiv-
ity and magnetic ﬁeld independent constant, respectively
[4]. In other words, the negative longitudinal magnetore-
sistance can be expressed as, ρc =

ρ0

1+aρ0B2 .

To probe the chiral anomaly, we have measured lon-
gitudinal magnetoresistance by applying both the cur-
rent and magnetic ﬁeld along the a axis. As shown in
Fig. 3, the resistance at 10 K gradually decreases with
increasing ﬁeld until a upturn occurs at high ﬁeld. A
small positive transverse MR component due to unavoid-
able misalignment in parallel conﬁguration is responsible
for this high ﬁeld upturn. As the positive MR compo-
nent rapidly suppresses with increasing temperature, the
longitudinal negative MR becomes more prominent at
higher temperatures 15 and 20 K. With further increase
in temperature above 20 K, however, the negative MR
itself becomes very weak.
In the inset of Fig. 3, MR
has been ﬁtted with the above mentioned theoretical ex-
pression of the enhanced magneto-conductance. Similar
to the earlier work [4], the negative longitudinal MR in
(cid:126)E(cid:107) (cid:126)B conﬁguration implies three-dimensional Dirac cone
state in the bulk of ZrTe5. It may be noted that nega-
tive MR due to induced chiral anomaly has also been re-
ported in other well established three-dimensional Dirac
semimetals Cd3As2 [32] and Na3Bi [33]. Presence of a
gap between upper and lower Dirac cone in bulk may
reduce the magnitude of the chiral current, but cannot

of motion the number of fermions with plus or minus chi-
rality is conserved separately. The relativistic theory of
charged chiral fermions in three spatial dimensions holds
the so-called chiral anomaly− non-conservation of chiral
charge induced by external gauge ﬁelds with non-trivial
topology, known as Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly [28, 29].
Nielsen and Ninomiya provided a more physical picture
of the chiral anomaly in the context of condensed mat-
ter physics [30]. Considering a band structure in three-
dimensions which supports two Weyl nodes with opposite
chirality separated in momentum space and applying a
magnetic ﬁeld in the z direction, they predicted an en-
hanced magneto-conductance due to the charge pump-
ing between the two nodes in the presence of an electric
ﬁeld ( (cid:126)E) parallel to (cid:126)B. The application of magnetic ﬁeld
in three-dimensional Dirac semimetal splits the four-fold
degenerate Dirac node into two Weyl nodes, along the
direction of magnetic ﬁeld [31, 32].
Initially, the plus
or minus chirality fermions in the diﬀerent Weyl nodes
have same chemical potential µR=µL. Whereas, (cid:126)E par-
allel to (cid:126)B creates an imbalance (µR(cid:54)=µL) between the

insulators, known as ”spin-momentum locking”. As the
”spin” is always perpendicular to the momentum, one
can introduce a helicity operator for the spin texture
on circular constant energy contour of the Dirac cones
[35], ˆh=(1/k)ˆz.((cid:126)k×(cid:126)σ). This leads to left handed spin
texture for the upper Dirac cone and right handed spin
texture for the lower Dirac cone in the momentum
space. Whereas at the Dirac point, the electron spins
should be free to align along the applied magnetic ﬁeld
as long as the Dirac spectrum is not gapped [36]. This
predicts a low-ﬁeld paramagnetic peak in M (H) curve.
Figure 4(a) shows the magnetization of a single crystal
of diamagnetic ZrTe5 by applying magnetic ﬁeld along
the a axis. Over the whole range of temperature from 2
to 300 K, ZrTe5 shows diamagnetic signal except a para-
magnetic upturn around zero ﬁeld. It might be worthy
to mention that single crystals of standard diamagnetic
bismuth and three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2
[37] do not show this type of behaviour [23]. Figure
4(b) shows that a cusp-like paramagnetic susceptibility
sharply rises above the diamagnetic ﬂoor in a narrow
ﬁeld range of ∼2 kOe (0.2 T). The sharpness of the peak
is insensitive to the temperature. This singular response
of susceptibility shows no sign of thermal rounding up to
room temperature (∼27 meV), which is almost one-half
of the bulk band gap [4, 21]. Similar robust and singular
paramagnetic response has been reported for the family
of three-dimensional topological insulators which is the
ﬁngerprint of the helical spin texture of the topological
Dirac fermions on the surface [36, 38]. Setting both
the chemical potential µ and temperature to zero, one
can show that this paramagnetic Dirac susceptibility
decays linearly from the zero-ﬁeld value at low ﬁeld [36]

In summary, we have detected a robust zero ﬁeld
paramagnetic peak in magnetization, which has been
established as a powerful tool to probe the spin response
of the helical spin texture associated with the Dirac
fermions of the surface state of three-dimensional topo-
logical insulators[36, 38]. Also, the negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance implies induced chiral anomaly in
ZrTe5, which is the signature of three-dimensional Dirac
fermion in the bulk [4, 30, 32]. This allows one to
conclude that ZrTe5 is a novel quantum phase of matter,
which hosts topological Dirac fermions in the surface
and three-dimensional Dirac cone state with a mass gap
between valence band and conduction in the bulk. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no such topological
insulator with Dirac fermionic excitation in the bulk
insulating state in the history of material science.
In
addition, it is also apparent from the present work that

The low-energy physics for the surface states of
topological insulator can be described by the Dirac type
eﬀective Hamiltonian, Hsur(kx,ky)=¯hvF (σxky-σykx),
where vF is the Fermi velocity [34, 35]. Thus, for a ﬁxed
translational momentum (cid:126)k, the ”spin,” denoted by the
Pauli matrix (cid:126)σ, has a ﬁxed direction for the eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian. This is the most important property of

is a large gap 2D topological insulator, as the theory

B. Magnetic measurements of standard samples

Prior to the magnetic measurements of ZrTe5,
we have standardize our system (SQUID VSM)
using Bismuth and Palladium.
Figure 6(a)
shows very linear diamagnetic moment of stan-
dard Bismuth sample (Alfa Aesar 99.99%) pass-
ing through the zero ﬁeld. This is more clear
from ﬁgure 6(b), which shows magnetic ﬁeld de-
pendence of diﬀerential susceptibility (χ= dM
dB ).
With quantum oscillation at high ﬁeld, ab-
sence of paramagnetic pear around zero ﬁeld im-
plies that singular paramagnetic susceptibility in
ZrTe5 single crystal is not due to any spurious re-
sponse in our system.

Phase purity and the structural analysis
of the samples were done using the high-
resolution powder x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) tech-
nique (Rigaku, TTRAX II) using Cu-Kα radia-
tion. Figure 5 shows the x-ray diﬀraction pat-
tern of a powdered sample of ZrTe5 single crys-
tals at room temperature. Within the resolution
of XRD, we did not see any peaks due to the im-
purity phase. Using the Rietveld proﬁle reﬁne-
ment program of diﬀraction patterns, we calcu-
lated the lattice parameters a=3.96 ˚A, b=14.50
˚A and c=13.78 ˚A with space group symmetry

vided by the Quantum Design. Figure 7(b)
shows the low ﬁeld susceptibility of Palladium
at 2 K and room temperature. The nonlinear
behaviour of χ at low ﬁeld and a broad zero ﬁeld
peak at 2 K are completely suppressed at room
temperature. This is completely diﬀerent from
the singular, robust and linear low ﬁeld para-
magnetic response from the topological surface
state in ZrTe5. For the sake of fundamental
interest, we have also measured the magnetiza-
tion of a single crystal of three-dimensional Dirac
semimetal Cd3As2, as shown in Figure 7(c). This
also shows perfect diamagnetic behaviour with
no paramagnetic sign at low ﬁeld.
