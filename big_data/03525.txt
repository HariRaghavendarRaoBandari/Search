We have prepared polycrystalline samples of the trimer Ir oxide BaIrO3 with face-shared Ir3O12
trimers, and have investigated the origin of the phase transition at 182 K by measuring resistivity,
thermopower, magnetization and synchrotron x-ray diﬀraction. We propose a possible electronic
model and transition mechanism, starting from a localized electron picture on the basis of the
Rietveld reﬁnement. Within this model, BaIrO3 can be basically regarded as a Mott insulator,
when the Ir3O12 trimer is identiﬁed to one pseudo-atom or one lattice site. The transition can be
viewed as a transition from the Mott insulator phase to a kind of charge ordered insulator phase.

INTRODUCTION

Strongly correlated electrons are seen in a certain class
of solids in which the Coulomb repulsion is too strong
to hold a simple one-electron picture based on the band
theory. They have occupied a central position in con-
densed matter sciences for many decades, and have at-
tracted keen interests from vast numbers of researchers
since the discovery of high-temperature superconduct-
ing copper oxides in 1986. They store a macroscopic
number of degeneracy and entropy based on spin and
charge degrees of freedom on each lattice site at high
temperature,1,2 and release them through various phase
transitions towards 0 K. Various forms of phase transi-
tions and ordered states have been discovered one after
another with the progress in the studies of strongly cor-
related electrons. In this context, understanding of new
phase transitions and ordered states is a major purpose
for strong-correlation physics.

BaIrO3 (18R phase) is an interesting oxide as a play-
ground for a new phase transition. The crystal structure
is schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), in which
the three IrO6 octahedra are connected with one another
in a face-sharing network, and form an Ir3O12 trimer
structure, as indicated in light brown and dark yellow.
The trimers are connected with each other in a corner-
sharing network and construct zig-zag chains along the c
axis and corrugated honeycomb lattices in the ab plane.
Owing to the low crystal symmetry of C2/m, two trimers
are inequivalent in the unit cell, as painted in diﬀerent
colors in the inset of Fig. 1(b).

The study of this oxide has a rather long history; Dono-
hue et al. ﬁrst reported the synthesis and structure of
this material in the 60’s,,3 and later Gai et al.4 stud-

ied the poly-types of 5H and 6H. Chamberland5 ex-
tensively studied the relationship of the poly-types to
the synthetic routes, and further found a magnetic phase
transition near 200 K. The physical and chemical prop-
erties of the poly-types have been measured rather re-
cently because of diﬃculty in the sample synthesis.6,7
Siegrist and Chamberland8 prepared single crystals and
determined the crystal symmetry of C2/m, which can be
viewed as pseudo-rhombohedral R-centered. Later Pow-
ell and Battle9 identiﬁed that this magnetic order is fer-
romagnetic, by measuring the temperature hysteresis and
the magnetization-ﬁeld curve. Linsay et al.10 measured
the remnant magnetization to demonstrate the ferromag-
netic ground state. Cao et al.11 measured the trans-
port and optical properties of a single-crystal sample of
BaIrO3, and found that the ferromagnetic order accom-
panies rapid increase in the resistivity below Tc ∼180
K. In addition, they observed a gap-like structure in the
optical conductivity below around 1000 cm−1, and at-
tributed this transition to charge-density-wave (CDW)
formation with ferromagnetic order. They further found
the additional two temperature anomalies near 80 and
30 K. Although the 80-K anomaly was ill-deﬁned, the
30-K anomaly was detected by other groups in a muon-
spin-relaxation experiment12 and in a nonlinear conduc-
tion measurement.13 Kini et al.14 measured the speciﬁc
heat of BaIrO3 and observed a small jump of 2 J/mol
K around 180 K, not around 30 and 80 K. They also
found that the thermopower rapidly increases below Tc,
and pointed out the existence of a charge gap below Tc.
Maiti et al.15 discussed the CDW state through photoe-
mission spectroscopy.

In this paper, we try to address the nature and mech-
anism of the 180-K phase transition in BaIrO3 on the

basis of the electronic states constructed from a localized
electron picture. A concern in the CDW scenario is that
there is no evidence for the lattice distortion at Tc. In
conventional CDW materials, a lattice modulation of 2kF
emerges below Tc through the electron-phonon interac-
tion, where kF is the Fermi wavenumber.16 To the best
of our knowledge, no superlattice reﬂections below Tc
have been reported in BaIrO3, and this implies that the
charge gap opens without translational-symmetry break-
ing. We have investigated the structure–property rela-
tionship through synchrotron x-ray diﬀraction, and pro-
pose a possible mechanism of the transition.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Polycrystalline samples of BaIr1−xRuxO3 (x ≤ 0.1)
were prepared using a conventional solid-state reaction.
A stoichiometric mixture of powder sources of BaCO3
(99.9%), RuO2 (99.9%) and Ir (99%) was thoroughly
ground in an agate mortar. The mixture was then pre-
sintered in an alumina crucible at 900◦C for 12 h in air,
and was pressed into pellets after re-grinding. The pellets
were sintered at 1000◦C for 36 h in air.

The synchrotron x-ray diﬀraction was

taken at

BL8A&8B, Photon-Factory, KEK, Japan. The x-ray en-
ergy was adjusted to be 18 keV, which was carefully cali-
brated using a standard powder sample of CeO2. Powder
samples were sealed in a silica-glass capillary of 0.1-mm
diameter, and the capillary was rotated by an angle of
30 deg from the sample-stage axis during measurement.
The sample temperature was controlled using a cool he-
lium gas or nitrogen gas. The diﬀraction patterns were
analyzed using the Rietveld reﬁnement with Rietan-FP
code.17

The resistivity was measured with a four-probe tech-
nique using a home-made measurement system in a
liquid-helium cryostat. The thermopower was measured
with a two-probe method using a home-made measure-
ment system in a liquid-helium cryostat, and the ther-
mopower of the measurement leads was carefully sub-
tracted. The temperature diﬀerence was typically 0.5
K which was monitored with a copper-constantan dif-
ferential thermocouple. The magnetization was mea-
sured with a commercial product of Quantum Design
Magnetic-Property-Measurement-System.

III. RESULTS

Figure 2 shows a synchrotron x-ray diﬀraction pattern
of BaIrO3 at room temperature. Since the scattering in-
tensity of oxygen is 100 times weaker than that of Ba and
Ir, we gave up determining the atomic position of oxygen
atoms, but instead employed the values reported in the
literature.8 Then we optimized the atomic positions of
Ba and Ir atoms above 100 K by iterating the calcula-
tion until the Rwp and SR values reached less than 3 %
and 4, respectively. We accepted worse values of Rwp=3
– 4.5% for the data below 100 K. The experimental data
are compared with the reﬁnement at 300, 150 and 34 K
in Figs. 2(b), (c) and (d), respectively. As shown in
Fig. 2, the reﬁnement is satisfactory; there are neither
detectable impurity phases nor poly-type phases, and the
deviation from the reﬁnement seems small enough to dis-
cuss the atomic positions of the Ir atoms. We measured
the diﬀraction patterns around Tc carefully, and found no
trace of superlattice reﬂections. This consolidates that
the phase transition does not accompany the violation of
translational symmetry, also indicating that this is un-
likely to be a CDW transition.

Figure 1(a) shows the transport properties of the poly-
crystalline sample of BaIrO3 obtained from the same
batch as used in the x-ray measurement. The resistivity
is non-metallic at all temperatures with an anomalous in-
crease near Tc =182 K. We should note that the resistiv-
ity above Tc is of activation type as indicated by the dot-
ted line shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The slope of the
dotted line gives a rough estimate of the activation gap
Eρ
g /kB around 240 K, which is small in comparison with
a band gap of conventional semiconductors. This is com-
parable to or even smaller than kBT , and it is nontrivial
whether or not we may regard this non-metallic behav-
ior as activation-type transport. According to the band
calculation of BaIrO3,18–20 the electronic states above Tc
are metallic with no gap in the density of states.

The thermopower also shows an anomaly near Tc, be-
low which it rapidly enhances with decreasing tempera-
tures. As Kini et al. pointed out,14 this is a clear in-
dication of the charge gap in the density of states,21,22
strongly indicating an insulating nature below Tc. The
thermopower takes a broad maximum near 100 K, and
goes towards zero with decreasing temperature. We think
this behavior is a crossover between the activation-type
transport from 100 to 180 K and the hopping conduction
in the impurity states below 100 K.23 The thermopower
above Tc is diﬃcult to interpret; the magnitude is as small
as that of metals, but the temperature dependence seems
of activation type just above Tc. We evaluate an activa-
tion energy ES
g /eT .
Again this activation energy is comparable or smaller
than kBT . We will come back to this point later.

ternal ﬁeld of 500 Oe measured in the ﬁeld-cooling pro-
cess. Around the same temperature of Tc, the magneti-
zation suddenly shows up with decreasing temperature.

timer Ir–Ir bond length d12 and d34 and (f) the inter-timer
angle Φ. The inset schematically designates d12, d34 and Φ.

This ferromagnetic behavior is consistent with the pre-
vious reports.10,11,24,25 From this ﬁgure, the magnetiza-
tion at 4 K is evaluated to be around 100 emu/mol, which
corresponds to a saturation magnetization of 0.016µB/Ir.
This unusually small moment is consistent with the pre-
vious works,10,11,24,25 and is associated with weak ferro-
magnetism of itinerant magnets. However, the electronic
ground state of this oxide is an insulator with a ﬁnite
energy gap in the density of states, and the origin of the
ferromagnetism is yet to be explored.

Figures 3 (a)-(d) show the lattice parameters plotted
as a function of temperature obtained from the Rietveld
reﬁnement of the x-ray diﬀraction patterns. The relative
uncertainty is less than 0.01%, and the size of the error
bars are smaller than the size of the closed circles. All the
parameters smoothly change with temperature across Tc,
indicating a nature of second-order transition. By having
a closer look at the data in Fig. 3(a), one ﬁnds a slight
cusp in the a-axis length near Tc as a piece of evidence
for ﬁnite electron-lattice coupling.

The c-axis length parallel to the zig-zag chain of the
trimers exhibits remarkable and nontrivial temperature
dependence; it increases with decreasing temperature as
shown in Fig.
3(c). Such negative temperature de-
pendence is diﬃcult to understand from solely lattice
eﬀects26 except for ZrW2O8.27 The negative expansion
is not observed in CDW materials,16,28 and can be an-
other piece of evidence that this transition is not CDW-
like. But rather, the negative lattice expansion comes
from various electronic origins.29 Prime examples are In-
var alloy,30 BaNiO3
31 and Mn3AN (A = Cu, Zn, Ga),32
in which electronic or magnetic instability tightly couples
with the lattice. The slopes of the negative expansion in
the c-axis length signiﬁcantly change across Tc as shown
by the dotted lines, clearly indicating that the negative
expansion characterizes the phase transition of the title
compound. One may notice that the angle β also in-
creases with decreasing temperature. Since the increase

in β reduces the lattice volume, the c axis tends to expand
in spite of the volume shrinkage at low temperature.

In order to clarify the structural origin of the nega-
tive expansion in the c-axis length, we examined what
kind of atomic displacement is responsible, and have ﬁ-
nally arrived at the intra-trimer Ir-Ir bond length. As
schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 3(e), there are
four crystallographically inequivalent Ir sites labeled 1, 2,
3 and 4. We deﬁne the bond length between Ir1 and Ir2 as
d12 and that between Ir3 and Ir4 as d34. As shown in Fig.
3(e), d34 increases with decreasing temperature, whereas
d12 remains constant. This clearly indicates that the two
timers are more inequivalent at lower temperatures. The
data are somewhat scattered in comparison with the lat-
tice parameters, possibly because the latter is determined
only by the 2θ values of the diﬀraction peaks whereas the
former needs accuracy in the relative intensity. Neverthe-
less we emphasize that d12 and d34 were independently
determined at each temperature within an uncertainty
of 10−4, and that increasing inequivalence at low tem-
peratures is inherent in this oxide. In addition, we have
ascribed the structural origin for the temperature depen-
dence of β to the inter-timer angle Φ as indicated at the
inset of Fig. 3(e). Figure 3(f) shows Φ plotted as a func-
tion of temperature, where Φ increases with decreasing
temperature. We can summarize the above results as fol-
lows: One trimer of Ir3-Ir4-Ir3 elongates with decreasing
temperature, and concomitantly the lattice distorts to
accept the elongation.

As mentioned above, it is diﬃcult to determine the
atomic position of the oxygen atoms from the syn-
chrotron x-ray diﬀraction used in the present experiment,
and this constraint prevents us from evaluating the for-
mal valence of Ir ions using bond-valence-sum calcula-
tion. In the next section, we try to estimate the formal
Ir valence by using the atomic position data for oxygen
from.8 Nevertheless we may infer from d12 and d34 that
the average number of d electrons in the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 timer
is larger than that in the Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer, for d elec-
trons feel the static Coulomb repulsion with one another
to stay as far as possible. We further speculate that a
ﬁnite fraction of charge rapidly transfers at Tc between
the two trimers, and also expect that this charge transfer
is a driving force for the phase transition. In this respect,
this charge transfer should be associated with the CDW
scenario by Cao et al..11 One essential diﬀerence from the
conventional CDW is that the two trimers are already in-
equivalent above Tc, and this charge transfer causes no
superlattice reﬂections with holding the same unit cell at
all temperature.

IV. DISCUSSION

Having the above results in mind, let us propose here
a possible electronic model for BaIrO3 starting from the
localized picture. As schematically drawn in Fig. 4(a),
one Ir ion has the electronic conﬁguration of (5d)5 in

the triply degenerate t2g level, for the formal valence of
Ir is 4+. Since the oxygen octahedron is trigonally dis-
torted, the t2g level lifts the degeneracy to have the a1g
and doubly-degenerate e′
g levels. In the present case, the
octahedron is compressed along the (111) direction of the
local coordinate, and thus the a1g level is the higher level
with one electron occupied.

There is a strong hybridization between the a1g lev-
els within a trimer owing to the short intra-trimer Ir–Ir
distance, and a kind of molecular orbital is expected to
be formed within the trimer as shown in the right side
of Fig. 4(a), where we denote the bonding, non-bonding
and anti-bonding orbitals made of the three a1g orbitals
as B, NB and AB, respectively. By putting the three
electrons from the bottom, we ﬁnd one electron in the
non-bonding orbital. Thus we may regard this state as
half-ﬁlling, when we identify one trimer to one pseudo-
atom. In this sense, we propose that BaIrO3 is a half-
ﬁlled trimer solid.

Very recently, Ir compounds have attracted exten-
sive interest as a strong spin-orbit interaction system, in
which the total angular momentum of j dominates the
band structure.34 A recent x-ray absorption study has
revealed the strong spin-orbit nature in BaIrO3, and the
highest occupied level should be regarded as the e′′ level
rather than the a1g level from the t2g levels as shown
in Fig. 4(b).33 Even in such a case, we can make simi-
lar molecular orbitals. The highest occupied state then
corresponds to the NB e′′ instead of the NB a1g, and

TABLE I. Estimation of the formal Ir valence. The atomic
positions for 300 K are employed from.8 For the data at 16 K,
we assume that Ir-O bond length changes with the same ratio
as d12 and d34. Namely, we use the same Ir-O bond lengths
as at 300 K for Ir1 and Ir2, and values 0.96%-larger than at
300 K for Ir3 and Ir4.

termined in the present reﬁnement, we have instead
employed the atomic position data at 300 K from8 and
have calculated ν as listed in Table 1. The 300-K data
indicate that the two trimers already have diﬀerent
charges; the Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer has a net charge of 12.23,
whereas the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 trimer has a 0.45-shorter value
of 11.78. Unlike the related ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10,41
the charge is not disproportionated within trimer sig-
niﬁcantly. A slight diﬀerence (0.16 for Ir1 and Ir2; 0.07
for Ir3 and Ir4) may correspond to the bonding orbital
widely spread within trimer, as is pointed out in.42 For
the calculation of the 16-K values, we used our data of
d12 and d34 shown in Fig. 3(e), and assume that the
trimers uniformly expand or shrink with temperature.
Namely we assume that the Ir-O bond lengths change
with temperature in the same ratio as the Ir-Ir bond
lengths. For the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 trimer, d34 increases from
2.615 to 2.640 ˚A from 300 down to 16 K, and thus
the Ir-O bond lengths at 16 K equals the 300-K value
multiplied by a factor of 2.640/2.615 = 1.0096, while
they remain unchanged for the Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer. With
this assumption, ν for Ir3 and Ir4 is further reduced
from the values at 300 K, as was discussed in the last
paragraph of Section 3. At 16 K, the Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer
has a net charge of 12.23, whereas the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 trimer
has a 1.05-shorter value of 11.18. This is in a reasonable
agreement with the picture in Fig. 4(d) in spite of our
rough and bold assumption.

Here let us compare our model with band calcula-
tions reported previously.18–20 Whangbo and Koo18 have
pointed out that the density of states of Ir2 and Ir4 (the
central Ir ion in the trimer) show pseudo gap at the Fermi
energy. This is explained in terms of molecular orbital.
The highest occupied states belong to the non-bonding
orbital of the a1g or e′′ state of the Ir ion, which has
a node at the center of the trimer. Note that the non-

bonding orbital is expressed by (ϕL − ϕR)/√2, where ϕL

is unlikely to alter the picture of the half-ﬁlled trimer
solid (Compare the left and right sides of Figs.4(c) and
4(d)). As is widely accepted, half-ﬁlled electron systems
is unstable against Mott insulator phase in the presence
of electron-electron correlation. We propose the normal
state of BaIrO3 is essentially in the Mott insulator phase,
and name this “trimer Mott insulator.”

Let us discuss here about the charge transport above
Tc. According to the Landau theory of metal-insulator
transition,35 there is a critical end point above which
metal and insulator cannot be distinguished.
In fact,
the transport properties above the critical end point can
be viewed as either bad metal or bad insulator, as re-
36 and κ-(BEDT-TTF)Cu[N(CN)2]Cl.37
ported in V2O3
We propose that the normal state of BaIrO3 should be
understood basically in terms of trimer Mott insulator,
with the critical end point below Tc.
If so, the charge
transport seems to show intermediate properties between
metal and insulator, which are exempliﬁed by the small
activation energies of Eρ
g . Zhao et al.38 have
found that external pressure increases the resistivity to
enhance the insulating nature of the title compound.
They further found that the transition temperature de-
creases with pressure. Kida et al.25 have also found the
large pressure dependence of Tc in the magnetization
measurement. Their results indicate that the pressure
stabilizes the insulating normal state, being consistent
with our trimer-Mott-insulator picture above Tc. Cao et
al.39 have also stated that BaIrO3 is in the verge of a
metallic state.

g and ES

Figure 4(c) schematically shows the trimer Mott in-
sulator phase above Tc. The Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer is in
the higher level because of the shorter intra-trimer Ir–
Ir bond length. All the timers have one electron in the
NB a1g or e′′ level, and the energy diﬀerence ∆ε is too
small to cause charge transfer. As the intra-trimer Ir–Ir
bond length of the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 trimer increases with de-
creasing temperature, ∆ε is expected to increase. At a
certain temperature, a rapid increase of ∆ε and a charge
transfer simultaneously happen, and the electronic states
schematically drawn in Fig. 4(d) realize below Tc, where
the NB orbital of the Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 trimer is empty and that
of the Ir3–Ir4–Ir3 timer is fully occupied. From the view
point of valence change, the Ir4+ state changes into a
disproportionate state of Ir3.67+ and Ir4.33+ in the neigh-
boring trimers. We regard this state as a kind of charge
ordered state rather than CDW state, because this has
no relation to the Fermi surface information such as nest-
ing or 2kF .16 We therefore propose that the transition at
180 K in BaIrO3 is a phase transition from the trimer
Mott insulator phase to the trimer charge ordered phase.

other calculations,19,20 and in particular, the calculation
with strong spin-orbit interaction20 gives a small Mott
gap which is consistent with the observed small activa-
tion energies of Eρ

was based on the structure at room temperature, the cal-
culated insulating states should be those above Tc.

g and ES

Our proposed model can explain various experimen-
tal results at least semi-quantitatively. It explains bad
metal/bad insulator behavior above Tc, a charge gap be-
low Tc without translational-symmetry breaking, and the
transition susceptible to external pressure. Since one
electron in the NB a1g or e′′ state per trimer is respon-
sible for magnetism, we can understand the small eﬀec-
tive magnetic moment of 0.16µB per Ir above Tc.11,24
The transition is basically an insulator-insulator transi-
tion, which can give anomalous critical exponents.24 This
transition looks similar to the neutral-ionic transition in
the charge transfer organic complexes showing non-linear
conduction.43,44 BaIrO3 also shows giant non linear con-
duction at low temperature,13 the origin of which may
be compared with the organic complexes. Within our
model, however, the weak ferromagnetism is diﬃcult to
understand, for all the trimers are nonmagnetic below Tc.
The ideal charge transfer of e in Figs. 4 (c) and (d) may
not occur in real materials, but only a fraction of e may
move between the trimers. In such a case, all the trimers
can be slightly magnetic and may show ferromagnetism
with the much smaller moment of 0.016µB below Tc.

It would be fair to point out controversial points and
limitations of our model. First, Figure 4 is an oversimpli-
ﬁed picture where transfer energies except for the intra-
timer case are neglected. In a real material, the compli-
cated band structure may invalidate our model, although
the band calculations reported so far do not always ex-
plain the experimental results satisfactorily. Secondly,
the strong correlation, i.e., the on-site Coulomb repul-
sion forces the electron density as homogeneous as pos-
sible, and disfavors the charge transfer from one trimer
to another. The proposed charge order may come from
a delicate balance among the on-site Coulomb repulsion,
the energy diﬀerence between the two timers, and the
transfer energies. A more complete theoretical model-
ing is needed to step further. Third, IrO6 octahedra are
distorted so that there are no pure a1g and eg orbitals
in a strict sense. Accordingly the molecular orbital such
as NB a1g may be misleading. Even in such a case, one
hole on Ir4+ of (5d)5 occupies the non-degenerate, highly
occupied orbital (say φi for Iri). Then we can make lin-
ear combinations from φ1 and φ2 for one Ir trimer, from
φ3 and φ4 for the other trimer. Again we can construct
a one electron in a corresponding non-bonding-like state
for one trimer, and ﬁnd the essence of our model left
unchanged.

To examine the validity of our model, we have investi-
gated the impurity eﬀects on the 182-K transition for a
set of polycrystalline samples of BaIr1−xRuxO3. Figure
5 shows the magnetization and the resistivity of the sam-
ples. The phase transition is systematically and drasti-
cally suppressed with the Ru concentration x, and essen-
tially vanishes at only 10% substitution; For x = 0.1, the
resistivity is non-metallic without any trace of anoma-
lies at all temperatures measured, whereas a tiny trace
of the weak ferromagnetic phase of x = 0 is visible
in the magnetization measurement. The resistivity for

inset shows the intra-trimer Ir-Ir bond lengths for the x = 0.1
sample. The two trimers have the identical, temperature-
independent bond length. (b) Magnetization M divided by
an external ﬁeld H of 500 Oe of the same samples.

x = 0.1 indicates the electronic states above Tc is es-
sentially insulating, being consistent with the picture of
the trimer Mott insulator. The inset of Fig. 5(a) shows
the intra-trimer Ir-Ir bond lengths for the x = 0.1 sam-
ple, where the two lengths of d12 and d34 are essentially
temperature-independent, and identical. Concomitantly
the negative expansion of the c-axis is severely suppressed
(not shown). The Ru substitution simultaneously sup-
presses the 182 K-transition and the electron transfer
from Ir1–Ir2–Ir1 to Ir3–Ir4–Ir3, and therefore these two
phenomena are two sides of the same coin. We further
note that the charge order is known to be vulnerable to
impurities,45 while the charge density wave is more or
less robust against impurities.46

A similar type of the phase transition occurs in the
organic salt β-(meso-DMBEDT-TTF)2PF6.47 Many con-
ductive organic salt with a chemical formula of A2B con-
sists of a dimer molecule of A2 as a composition unit. In
the present case, two molecules of meso-DMBEDT-TTF
form a dimer structure, and share one hole per dimer to
behave as dimer Mott insulator .48 Okazaki et al.49 iden-
tiﬁed the phase transition in this compound at 70 K to
a transition from dimer Mott insulator phase to charge
ordered insulator phase. This results from a competi-

tion between the intra- and inter-dimer Coulomb inter-
actions, which causes intrinsic inhomogeneous state de-
tected through infrared microscope measurement. As is
similar to BaIrO3, this organic salt also shows non-linear
conduction below Tc.50

Finally we brieﬂy comment that we have applied a sim-
ilar molecular orbital concept to the related timer Ru
oxide Ba4Ru3O10 in which the three face-shared RuO6
octahedra form a Ru3O12 trimer.22,41,51 This related ox-
ide shows a phase transition at 105 K, where a metal-
lic, paramagnetic state changes into an insulating, an-
tiferromagnetic state at low temperature. However, the
electronic states are diﬀerent; In this related oxide, each
trimer is three electrons short because Ru4+ has four 4d
electrons. On the basis of a similar molecular orbital ap-
proach, we have to consider partially occupied e′
g orbitals.
In this case, the static electronic potential is deeper at
the center of the trimer, and a ﬁnite fraction of charge is
expected to transfer from the edge. Namely, intra-timer
charge transfer drives the phase transition in Ba4Ru3O10.
This makes a stark contrast to the inter-trimer charge
transfer in BaIrO3. The intra-trimer charge dispropor-
tionation has been also discussed from the local-density-
approximation calculations.42,52

V. SUMMARY

In summary, we have prepared polycrystalline sam-
ples of the trimer oxide BaIrO3 with the face-shared
Ir3O12 trimers, and have measured the resistivity, ther-
mopower, magnetization and synchrotron x-ray diﬀrac-
tion from room temperature down to 4 K. On the basis
of the structure analysis, we have made a model for the

7

electronic states of this oxide, and have pointed out that
this oxide can be regarded as a kind of Mott insulator,
when the Ir3O12 trimer is identiﬁed to one lattice site.
Within the same framework, the 182-K transition can
be viewed as a transition from the trimer Mott insulator
phase to the trimer charge-ordered phase, which is essen-
tially diﬀerent from conventional charge density wave as
was used to be a candidate for the transition. We have
further succeeded in explaining various properties above
Tc such as the non-metallic resistivity and thermopower,
the large pressure eﬀect, the unusually small eﬀective
magnetic moment. We expect that the proposed con-
cept of trimer solid will be applied to other face-shared
transition metal oxides.
