In this paper we construct a two variables p-adic L-function for the standard representation
associated with a Hida family of parallel weight genus g Siegel forms, using a method previously
developed by B¨ocherer–Schmidt in one variable. When a form of weight g + 1 is Steinberg at p, a
trivial zero appears and, using the method of Greenberg–Stevens, we calculate the ﬁrst derivative
of this p-adic L-function and show that it has the form predicted by a conjecture of Greenberg on
trivial zeros.

1. Introduction

Let M be an irreducible motive, pure of weight 0 over Q; suppose that s = 0 is a critical integer

`a la Deligne for M and L(M, 0) 6= 0.
We ﬁx a prime number p and let V be the p-adic representation associated with M . We ﬁx once
and for all an isomorphism C ∼= Cp. We suppose that we are given a regular submodule D of
the (ϕ, Γ)-module associated with V [Ben11, §0.2]. Conjecturally, there exists a p-adic L-function
Lp(V, D, s) which interpolates the special values of the L-function of M twisted by ﬁnite-order
characters of 1 + pZp [PR95], multiplied by a corrective factor (to be thought of as part of the
local epsilon factor at p) which depends on D. In particular, we expect the following interpolation
formula at s = 0:

Lp(V, D, s) = E(V, D)

L(M, 0)
Ω(M )

,

for Ω(M ) a complex period and E(V, D) some Euler type factors which have to be removed in
order to permit p-adic interpolation (see [Ben11, §2.3.2] or [Coa91, §6]).

In this case the connection with what we are interested
certain of these Euler factors vanish.
in, the special values of the L-function, is lost. Motivated by the seminal work of Mazur–Tate–
Teitelbaum [MTT86], Greenberg, in the ordinary case [Gre94], and Benois [Ben11] have conjectured
the following:

Conjecture 1.1. [Trivial zeros conjecture] Let e be the number of Euler-type factors of Ep(V, D)
which vanish. Then the order of zeros at s = 0 of Lp(V, D, s) is e and

(1.2)

lim
s→0

Lp(V, D, s)

se

= ℓ(V, D)E∗(V, D)

L(M, 0)
Ω(M )

for E∗(V, D) the non-vanishing factors of E(V, D) and ℓ(V, D) a non-zero number called the ℓ-
invariant as deﬁned in [Ben11].

In this paper we shall study this conjecture for a certain p-adic L-function associated with Siegel
modular forms. Let f be a genus g Siegel modular form of parallel weight k, level Γ0(N ) and trivial
Nebentypus. For each Dirichlet character χ we can deﬁne a L-function L(s, St(f ), χ), deﬁned as an
inﬁnite Euler product of factors of degree 2g + 1, which corresponds, up to some Euler factors at
bad primes, to the L-function associated with the Standard Galois representation constructed in
[Sch15]. Its critical values are the integers 1 ≤ s ≤ k−g with (−1)s+g = χ(−1) and g+1−k ≤ s ≤ 0
with (−1)1+s+g = χ(−1).

We suppose that f is ordinary for the Up operator, i.e. Upf = αpf with |α|p = 1. We know
that f can be deformed into a one variable Hida family of ordinary Siegel forms: we have a ﬁnite
ﬂat Zp[[1 + pZp]]-algebra O(F), quotient of the big ordinary Hecke algebra T, which parametrizes
systems of eigenvalues of ordinary Siegel forms of parallel weight. Sometimes in literature this is
called a GLg-ordinary family.

We say that a point of Spec(Zp[[Z×

p ]]) is arithmetic if it corresponds to a character

z 7→ ε(z)zk,

with ε a ﬁnite order character. We say that a point x ∈ Spec(O(F))(Cp) is arithmetic if the map

w : Spec(O(F) ⊗ Cp) → Spec(Zp[[X]] ⊗ Cp)

is ´etale, w(x) is an arithmetic point of type z 7→ zk with k ≥ g + 1 and the corresponding system
of eigenvalues in the Hecke algebra is classical. We shall denote by fx a Siegel eigenform with this
system of eigenvalues.

As fx is ordinary, there is an obvious choice for the regular sub-module D which appears in the
deﬁnition of the p-adic L-function; we shall hence suppress the dependence from D in the notation.
This deﬁnes in particular a choice of the Satake parameters for fx, as we explain in Section 5; we
shall denote them denote by βi(fx). We deﬁne:

E1(fx, s) =

g

Yi=1

(1 − β−1

(fx)ps+g−k),

E(fx, s) =E1(fx, s)

The ﬁrst result of the paper is the following:

Theorem 1.3. Suppose the “p-adic multiplicity one” hypothesis of Section 5. We have an element
Lp(x, s) ∈ Frac(O(F) ˆ⊗Zp[[Z×
p ]]) which satisﬁes, for all point (x, s) arithmetic with 0 ≤ s ≤ k−g−1,

DERIVATIVE OF THE STANDARD p-ADIC L-FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH A SIEGEL FORM

the following interpolation property:

Lp(x, s) = E(fx, s)

L(N p)(St(f ), s + g + 1 − k)

Ω(fx, s)

,

where L(N p)(St(f ), s) stands for the L-function without any Euler factor at N p and Ω(fx, s) is a
complex period involving the Petersson norm of fx and powers of 2πi.

See Theorem 5.2 for more details on the factors that appear, for the interpolation formula at
points of type (x, ε, s), for twists by characters χ of level prime to p and for a way to interpolate
L(p)(St(f ), s).

This p-adic L-function will be constructed using a two-variable generalization of the method
of [BS00] which expresses L(s, St(f )) as a double Petersson product of fx with certain Eisenstein
series. The p-adic interpolation of the Fourier coeﬃcients of these series is the key ingredient for
the construction of the p-adic L-function.

A more general results, always starting from [BS00] but using an adelic language, has been
given in [Liu16b] where a g + 1-variable p-adic L-function interpolating the other critical values is
constructed.

Remark that the p-adic L-function depends on a compatible choice of fx in the family and a
diﬀerent choice would give a diﬀerent p-adic L-function. The “p-adic multiplicity one for F” is not
really necessary and is used to show that we can make such a compatible choice. It could be easily
removed as in [Liu16b, §7] but it helps us simplifying the interpolation formula.

Possible denominators in the ﬁrst variable are related to the non-´etalness of the weight map w
and a denominator in the second variable comes from a possible pole of the Kubota–Leopoldt p-
adic L-function which appears in the Fourier coeﬃcients of the p-adic Eisenstein series we construct.

We study now when this p-adic L-function presents trivial zeroes.
If k = g + 1 we can have E1(fx, 0) = 0 when p−1 appears between the Satake parameter of fx.
We shall say that such an fx is Γ0(p)-Steinberg (see 6.1 for a precise deﬁnition). If fx comes from
a form of level prime to p we have

g

E(fx, s)L(p)(St(f ), s + g + 1 − k) =E1(fx, s)(1 − pk−s−g−1)

(1 − β−1

i pk−s−g−1)L(St(f ), s + 1 + g − k).

Yi=1

This implies that for s = k − g − 1 the p-adic L-function is identically zero. The observation that
βipk−g is an analytic function on Frig makes one realize that it is possible to exploit the strategy
of Greenberg–Stevens to calculate the p-adic derivative of Lp(f, s) when f is Γ0(p)-Steinberg.

Indeed, generalizing the paper [Ros15a] where the case g = 1 (the symmetric square of a modular
form) has been dealt, one can modify the construction of the Eisenstein family; this allows us to
deﬁne a second p-adic L-function L∗
p(x). This new p-adic L-function satisﬁes the following equality
of locally analytic functions around f

Lp(x, 0) = E(fx, 0)L∗

p(x)

and moreover it precisely interpolates the values L(St(f ), 0). We can then prove the main theorem
of the paper:

Theorem 1.4. Let f be a Siegel form of weight g + 1 and trivial Nebentypus. Suppose that f is
Γ0(p)-Steinberg and the weight projection w is ´etale at the corresponding point x. Then we have:

where ℓal(St(f )) is the Greenberg–Benois ℓ-invariant as calculated in [Ros15b] and

We conclude the introduction with the remark that this does not prove Conjecture 1.1 as we do

not know if ℓal(St(f ))L(N p)(St(f ), 0) is not vanishing.

Conjecturally the ℓ-invariant should not vanish but practically nothing is known at the moment.
The L-value can indeed vanish as we are interpolating an imprimitive L-function; for certain
primes l | N we have removed the factor (1 − l0) = 0. In this case a study of the second derivative
should be necessary; to the author, this problem seems very hard.

2. Notation on Siegel Forms

We now recall the basic theory of (parallel weight) Siegel modular forms. We follow closely the
notation of [BS00] and we refer to the ﬁrst section of loc. cit. for more details. Let us denote by
Hg the Siegel space for GSp2g. We have explicitly

Z3 Z4 (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Hg =(cid:26) Z =(cid:18) Z1 Z2

Z t = Z and Im(Z) > 0(cid:27) .

C D (cid:19)
2g(R) via fractional linear transformations; for any M =(cid:18) A B

It has a natural action of GSp+

in GSp+

2g(R) and Z in H2g we deﬁne

M (Z) = (AZ + B)(CZ + D)−1.

For any function F : Hg → C we deﬁne the weight k action

F |kM (Z) := F (M (Z))det(CZ + D)−kdet(M )k/2.

Let Γ = Γ0(N ) be the congruence subgroup of Sp2g(Z) of matrices whose lower block C is congruent
to 0 modulo N . We consider the space M (g)
k (N, φ) of scalar Siegel forms of weight k and Nebentypus
φ:

{F : Hg → C |F |kM (Z) = φ(M )F (Z) ∀M ∈ Γ, f holomorphic } .

Each F in M (g)

k (Γ, φ) admits a Fourier expansion

F (Z) =XT

a(T )e2πitr(T Z),

where T =(cid:18) T1 T2

tT2 T4 (cid:19) ranges over all matrices T positive and semi-deﬁned, with T1, T4 integral

matrices and and T2 half-integral.

We can embed Hg × Hg in H2g in the following way:

This embedding is compatible with the action of GSp+

2g(R). For all γ we have:

Consequently, evaluation at z2 = 0 gives us the following map:
k (N, φ) ⊗C M (g)

(N, φ) ֒→ M (g)

M (2g)

k (N, φ).

This also induces a closed embedding of two copies of the Siegel variety of genus g in the Siegel
variety of genus 2g. On points, it corresponds to abelian varieties of dimension 2g which decompose
as the product of two abelian varieties of dimension g.

We deﬁne Hecke operators as double cosets operators; let γ be an element of GSp2g(Q) with
positive determinant and Γ1, Γ2 two congruences subgroups. We write Γ1γΓ2 = ⊔iΓ1γi and we
deﬁne the Hecke operator of weight k

f |k[Γ1γΓ2] =Xγi

f |kγi.

We denote by τN the operator (cid:20)Γ0(N )(cid:18) 0 −1

N 0 (cid:19) Γ0(N )(cid:21). This operator is a generalization of

the Atkin–Lehner involution for GL2 and is sometime called the Fricke involution. For for any
Hecke operator T we deﬁne the dual operator T ∗ = τ −1
N T τN . Once we shall deﬁne the Petersson
scalar product, T ∗ will indeed be the dual operator of T for this product at level Γ0(N ).

Finally we deﬁne the Hecke operator Up of level Γ0(p) and weight k to be

gk−g(g+1)

p1g (cid:19) Γ0(p)(cid:21) .
If F (Z) =PT a(T )e2πitr(T Z) we have from [Hid02, Proposition 3.5]:

3. Eisenstein series

The aim of this section is to recall certain Eisenstein series which will be used to construct
the p-adic L-function as in [BS00]. In loc. cit. the authors consider certain Eisenstein series for
GSp4g whose pullback to two embedded copies of the Siegel variety for GSp2g is a holomorphic
Siegel modular form. We now ﬁx a (parallel weight) Siegel modular form f of genus g. We shall
deﬁne the standard L-function for f L(St(f ), s) as an Eulerian product. We shall give an integral
expression for this L-function as a double Petersson product between f and these Eisenstein series
(see Proposition 3.3). Note that for g = 1 the standard L-function of f coincides, up to a twist,
with the symmetric square L-function of f .
These Eisenstein series are essentially Maß–Shimura derivative of classical Siegel Eisenstein series
[Shi83] and the integral formulation of the L-function is the classical pullback formula of Garret
and Piateski-Shapiro–Rallis.

The study of the algebraicity of these diﬀerential operators has already been exploited in [Har85,
Har86] to show that certain values of the standard L-function, naturally normalized, are algebraic.
The approach of B¨ocherer–Schmidt consists instead in using a holomorphic diﬀerential operator

in place of the Maaß–Shimura operators.

The two develop then a twisting method which allow to deﬁne Eisenstein series whose Fourier
coeﬃcients satisfy Kummer’s congruences when the character associated with the Eisenstein series
varies p-adically. This is the key for their construction of the one variable (cyclotomic) p-adic
L-function and of our two-variable p-adic L-function.

When the character is trivial modulo p there exists a simple relation between the twisted and
the not-twisted Eisenstein series [BS00, §6 Appendix] which introduces certain Euler factors at p in
the interpolation formula for the p-adic L-function. We shall construct then an improved p-adic L-
function without these Euler factors (renouncing to the cyclotomic variable) interpolating directly
the not-twisted Eisenstein series.

3.1. Some diﬀerential operators. In this section we recall some holomorphic diﬀerential opera-
tors used by B¨ocherer–Schmidt. Let k and s be two positive integers; in [BS00, (1.15)], the authors
deﬁne a diﬀerential operators ˚Ds
g,k. This operator sends a holomorphic function, automorphic of
weight k on H2g to a holomorphic function on Hg × Hg automorphic of weight k + s in both the
ﬁrst and the second variable. A structure theorem for diﬀerential operators on nearly automorphic
forms [Shi86, Proposition 3.4] ensure us that this operator is a scalar multiple, depending on k and
s, of the Maß–Shimura operator composed with the holomorphic projection.

For each symmetric matrix I =(cid:18) T1 T2

2 T4 (cid:19) of size 2g, they deﬁne a number bs

T t

k(I) satisfying:

˚Ds

g,k(etr(IZ)) = bs

k(I) is a polynomial in the entries of Ti, homogeneous of degree sg. If 1

If I varies, bs
are both half-integral then we have the congruence [BS00, (1.34)]:

This relation will be the key to interpolate p-adically the ordinary projection of the Eisenstein series
we are about to introduce.

3.2. Some Eisenstein series. We ﬁx a weight k, an integer N prime to p and a Nebentypus φ.
Let f be an eigenform in M (g)
k (N p, φ). Let R be an integer coprime with N and p and N1 a positive
integer such that N1 | N . We ﬁx a Dirichlet character χ modulo N1Rp which we write as χ1χ′ε1,
with χ1 deﬁned modulo N1, χ′ primitive modulo R and ε1 deﬁned modulo p. Let us denote by S

the product of all prime dividing Rp. Let t ≥ 1 be an integer and let Ft+1(cid:0)z1, z4, R2N 2p2n, φ, u(cid:1)(χ)

be the twisted Eisenstein series of [BS00, (5.3)]. We deﬁne

depends from a real variable u. It is a form of level Γ0(N 2R2p)×Γ0(N 2R2p) and weight k = t+g+s.
We shall sometimes choose L = 1 and in this case the level is N 2R2p2n.
For any prime number q and matrices I as in the previous section, let Bq(X, I) be the polynomial
of degree at most 2g − 1 of [BS00, Proposition 5.1]. Let η be and T2 a semi-positive deﬁnite matrix
of size g × g. For a positive integer t we deﬁne:

Note that each sum over I is ﬁnite because I must have positive determinant. Moreover, we can

rewrite it as a sum over T2, with (2det(T2), N1Rp) = 1 and T1T4 − T 2

It is proved in [BS00, Theorem 8.5] that (small modiﬁcations of) these functions H′

L,χ(z, w)
satisfy Kummer’s congruences. The key fact is what they call the twisting method [BS00, (2.18)];

the Eisenstein series Ft+1(cid:0)z, R2N 2p2n, φ, u(cid:1)(χ) are obtained weighting Ft+1(cid:0)z, R2N 2p2n, φ, u(cid:1) with

respect to χ over integral matrices modulo N Rpn. To ensure these Kummer’s congruences, even
when p does not divide the conductor of χ, the authors are forced to consider χ of level divisible
by p. Using nothing more than Tamagawa’s rationality theorem for GLn, they ﬁnd the relation
[BS00, (7.13’)]:

Ft+1(cid:0)z, R2N 2p2, φ, u(cid:1)(χ)

= Ft+1(cid:0)z, R2N 2p2, φ, u(cid:1)(χ1χ′)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where gi,j runs along the representative of the double cosets in [BS00, (2.38)] and S(X) is the

Consequently, the Eisenstein series we want to interpolate to construct the improved p-adic L-
function is the one appearing inside formula (2.25’) of [BS00], namely:

In what follows, for two forms f and g of level Γ and weight k, we shall denote by hf, gi the

normalized Petersson product:

hf, giΓ :=ZHg/Γ

f (z)g(−z)det(Im(z))k.

We conclude with the integral formulation of L(St(f ), χ, s) [BS00, Theorem 3.1, Proposition 7.1

Remark 3.4. This is essentially a reformulation of the classical pull-back formula of Garrett and
Piateski-Shapiro–Rallis [GPSR87, Part A].

If UN f 6= 0 we can then take N1 = 1 in which case we do not remove any extra factor.

4. Families of Eisenstein series

4.1. Families of ordinary Siegel forms. We recall Hida’s theory for parallel weight Siegel forms,
following [Pil12, §4]. For i = 0, . . . , g we deﬁne the Hecke operators:

1i

p−11g−i

Up,i =

and Up = p

p = pgk−g(g+1)Up,g This normalization is
optimal if one wants the Up operator to preserve both p-integrality and non-vanishing modulo p.
We let Vl,∞ be the set of p-adic modular forms of tame level N with Z/plZ-coeﬃcients (of any
Vl,∞)SLg(Zp), which should
weight); it is equipped with an action of GLg(Zp). We deﬁne V∞ = (lim
−→l
be thought as a space of p-adic Siegel forms with Qp/Zp coeﬃcients. We have a Up-operator acting
on V∞ and we deﬁne V = HomZp(eGLg V∞, Qp/Zp) for eGLg = limn Un!
p . This is the ordinary
projector “adapted to parallel weight” of [Pil12, D´eﬁnition 5.1].

DERIVATIVE OF THE STANDARD p-ADIC L-FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH A SIEGEL FORM

10

We let Λ = Zp[[Z×

p ]], it has a natural Zp-linear action on V∞: z ∈ Z×

g ∈ GLg(Zp) of determinant z. We shall write z ∈ Z×
character.

p acts via any matrix
p as ω(z) hzi, being ω the Teichm¨uller

Hence we can consider V∞ and V as Λ-modules and we deﬁne

M∞ :=HomΛ(HomZp(V∞, Qp/Zp), Λ),

M :=HomΛ(V, Λ).

The module M is the (free of ﬁnite type) module of Λ-adic ordinary forms. As shown in [Liu16b],
each element of M∞ or M admits a q-expansion with Λ coeﬃcients; indeed, each element in V has
a q-expansion in Qp/Zp and each T deﬁnes a map ˜λT : V → Qp/Zp. Applying duality twice to ˜λT
we obtain a map λT : M → Λ which deﬁnes the qT -th coeﬃcient of an element of M and commute
with specialization at any point of Λ.

We have an action of the Hecke algebra T on M which makes M a ﬁnite module over T. Moreover
T is ﬁnite over Λ. We shall call an irreducible component F of Spec(T) a Hida family of Siegel
eigensystem. To each F we can associate the corresponding eigenspace on M consisting of O(F)-adic
q-expansions.

The same theory can be developed for Siegel form with Nebentypus outside p [Pil12, Th´eor`eme
7.2]. In what follows we shall, if not clear from the context, emphasize the dependence from the
tame level N by writing MN and TN .

We conclude this section recalling this important theorem, originally due to Hida, which in this

form is due Pilloni:

Theorem 4.1. Let k be an integer, i an integer, 0 ≤ i < p − 1 and Pk the kernel of the map
[i, k] : Λ → Zp sending z ∈ Z×

p to ωi(z) hzik ∈ Zp. For k big enough we have

M ⊗ Λ/Pk

∼= M (g)

k (IwN , χω−i)ord,

where the subscript ord refers to ordinarity for Up and IwN the intersection of Γ0(N ) with the
p-Iwahori subgroup of GSp2g of matrices which are upper triangular modulo p.

Remark 4.2. Conjecturally, the optimal k for the theorem to hold is g + 1 and this is proven for
g = 1. For g = 2, the best bound is 4 [Pil11].

We want to point out the Hecke action on the space of Siegel forms in [Pil12] and in this paper
diﬀer by a character. Namely, using the complex uniformization of the Siegel variety, the action in
loc. cit. would be given by

F |kM (Z) = F (M (Z))det(CZ + D)−kdet(M )k.

4.2. The Eisenstein family. We now use the above deﬁned Eisenstein series to give examples of
p-adic families. More precisely, we shall construct a two-variable measure (which will be used for
the two variables p-adic L-function) and a one variable measure (which will be used to construct
the improved one variable L-function).
Let us ﬁx χ = χ1χ′ε1 as before. We suppose χ even. We recall the Kubota-Leopoldt p-adic
L-function:

Theorem 4.3. Let η be a even Dirichlet character. There exists a p-adic L-function Lp(κ, η)
satisfying the following interpolation formula for any integer t ≥ 1 and ﬁnite-order character ε of

DERIVATIVE OF THE STANDARD p-ADIC L-FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH A SIEGEL FORM

11

1 + pZp:

Lp(ε(u)[t], η) = (1 − (εω−tη)0(p))L(1 − t, εω−tη),

where η0 stands for the primitive character associated with η. If η is not trivial then Lp([t], η) is
holomorphic. Otherwise, it has a simple pole at [0].

We can consequently deﬁne p-adic analytic functions interpolating the Fourier coeﬃcients of the
logp(z)
logp(u) . For T1 and

Eisenstein series deﬁned in the previous section; for any z in Z∗
T4 two positive semi-deﬁnite matrices we deﬁne the function:

p, we deﬁne lz =

for I as in Theorem 3.2. (Here κ is the weight variable and κ′ is the variable for t. Recall that
s = k − g − t.)
Note that the terms for I with (det(T2), p) 6= 1 are always 0.
We recall that if p−jT1 and p−jT4 are half integral we have [BS00, (1.21, 1.34)]:

g,t+1(I) ≡ (−1)s2gscs

We shall now construct the improved Eisenstein family. We let χ = χ1χ′ be a Dirichlet character

modulo N1R and (as before) we see φ as a Dirichlet character modulo N p. We deﬁne

a∗

T1,T4(κ) =

 .

Note that the terms for I with (det(T2), p) 6= 1 are not necessarily 0 contrary to the previous
construction. We now construct another p-adic family of Eisenstein series:

We can construct a two-variable family of Eisenstein series, generalizing [BS00, Theorem 8.6]:

(cid:3)

We want to explain brieﬂy why the construction above works in the ordinary setting and not in

the ﬁnite slope one.
It is slightly complicated to explicitly calculate the polynomial bs
that they vary p-adically with s. But we know that ˚Ds

The same method does not work for ﬁnite slope forms, as the ﬁnite slope projector is very
diﬀerent for Hida’s ordinary projector. To construct p-adic L-functions for families of ﬁnite slope
forms one should then be able to estimate the overconvergent norm of these derivatives and show
that they satisfy certain distribution relations. The interested reader is referred to [Liu16a] where
the p-adic avatars of Maaß–Shimura operators are studied.

t+1(I) reduces to cs

l by ∂s

5. p-adic L-functions

We now construct two p-adic L-functions using the above Eisenstein measures: the two-variable
one and the improved. We ﬁx a tame level N and two characters: χ1 modulo N1 for N1 | N , and
χ′ modulo R, with (R, N p) = 1. Let R0 be the product of all the primes dividing R, S = R0p and
χ = χ′χ1. Consider an irreducible component F of the ordinary Hecke algebra TN R0; we suppose
that all the classical specializations of F have level Γ0(p) at p.

We make the following hypothesis
p-adic Mult. one The generalized Hecke eigenspace on M ⊗Λ Frac(Λ) associated with F is

one-dimensional.

This hypothesis is not really necessary but simplify the deﬁnition and the evaluation of the p-adic
L-function. The reader interested in removing ths hypothesis is referred to [Liu16b, §7].

Let us decompose

Tord ⊗Λ Frac(Λ) = IF ⊕ B

and let 1F be the corresponding idempotent. Let us denote by F a Siegel form in 1FMord⊗ΛFrac(Λ).
We deﬁne a twisted trace operator, following ideas of Perrin-Riou and Hida [Hid88, 1.VI]. Let

N and L be two integers, we deﬁne the operator [L/N ] to be

[N/L]

: M (g)

TL/N := TrL/N ◦ [N/L],

for TrL/N the trace from M (g)
If L is
coprime with p than this operator can be p-adically interpolated over the weights space. Let R0 be
the product of all prime factors of R. We hence deﬁne Lp(κ, κ′) to be such that

g (cid:17), φ) to M (g)

1F ⊗ 1F(Id⊗TN 2R2/N R0H(κ, κ′)) = Lp(κ, κ′)F ⊗ F.

Remark 5.1. It is clear that this p-adic L-function depends from the choice of F. We do not have a
duality between modular form and Hecke algebra so there is no clear choice for such F. In contrast,
for g = 1, there is a duality given by the ﬁrst Fourier coeﬃcient a(1, f |T ), as a(1, Tnf ) = a(n, f ).

Similarly we have a one-variable p-adic L-function L∗

p(κ) deﬁned as

1F ⊗ 1F(Id⊗TN 2R2/N S′H∗(κ)) = L∗

p(κ)F ⊗ F.

Qi βi(fx) = p

For a form fx in the family F we denote by βi(fx) the Satake parameters for fx. We have
p . As fx is ordinary we know that it is of ﬁnite slope for the operators Up,i.
In particular, we have that βipk−i deﬁnes analytic functions O(F)[1/p]. As this will not change the
interpolation properties of the p-adic L-function, we can and shall choose the indexing of the βi’s
such that βipk−i is a p-adic unit. This amounts to say that fx is ordinary for all the Up,i. We shall
denote by Bi the corresponding unit in O(F).

We shall write w : Frig → W := Spf(Λ)rig. We shall say that a point x ∈ F(Qp) is ´etale if w is ´etale

Theorem 5.2. For points (x, κ′) of type (k, t, ε) such that x is ´etale, 1 ≤ t ≤ k − g we have the
following interpolation formula:

Remark 5.4. Let us denote by ρf,Sta the standard Galois representation constructed in [Sch15] and
by DSt(ρf,Sta) the semi-stable (ϕ, N )-module associated with it. The factor

png(1−t)

G(εω−t)g(cid:16)p

is the ǫ-factor of the Weil–Deligne representation associated with the (ϕ, N )-submodule spanned by
the eigenvectors of eigevanlues βi(fx), as predicted in [Coa91, §6]. Also the factor E(fx, ε, t) is the
one predicted by Coates. Note also that their product does not depend on the monodromy N .

Remark 5.5. The key to obtain the factorization above is that the factor E1 which brings the trivial
zero for forms Γ0(p)-Steinberg is an analytic function of x:

E1(fx, 1, k − g) =

The proof of second part of the theorem is very similar. Comparing [BS00, (7.13), (7.13)’] we

see that the only diﬀerence with the previous calculation is that we have to remove the factor

Here the power of p compensate the missing power of p in the term A∗ which appears in the
interpolation formula (4.8).
(cid:3)

6. A formula for the derivative

We now ﬁx a form f of weight g + 1 and we suppose that f has a Satake parameter, let us say
βg, equal to p−1. Conjecturally, this should imply that πf has not spherical level at p (as otherwise
the βi’s should all be Weil number of weight zero). In particular, if ϕ = (ρ, N ) is the L-parameter
(with values in GSpin2g+1) of πf,p then N should have a 1 in the g, g + 1 entry.
Deﬁnition 6.1. We say that f is Γ0(p)-Steinberg at p if βg = p−1 and the g, g + 1 entry of N is
not zero.

This condition should conjecturally ensure us that the trivial zero is brought by E1 and not by
the missing factor (1 − p−s) of the completed L-function for St(f ). We remark that Γ0(p)-Steinberg
points are isolated in Spec(T) in the sense that only ﬁnitely many forms in Spec(T) satisfy this
condition (as pk−gβg must have ﬁxed p-adic valuation). We know recall the main theorem of the
paper:

Theorem 6.2. Let f be a Siegel form of weight g + 1 and trivial Nebentypus; suppose that f is
Γ0(p)-Steinberg and the corresponding point on Frig is ´etale, then

E∗(f ) =Qg

Proof. By hypothesis we have that f corresponds to a point x which is ´etale over W = Spf(Λ)rig.
Let us write t0 = (z 7→ ω−g−1(z)zg+1); t0 is a local uniformizer in OW,[g+1] and, by ´etalness, t0 is
also a local uniformizer for OFrig,x. We have an isomorphism between the tangent spaces and this
induces an isomorphism on derivations:

DerK(OW,[g+1], Cp) ∼= DerK (OFrig,x, Cp).

The isomorphism is made explict by ﬁxing a common basis ∂
∂T . We consider the two variable p-adic
L-function of Theorem 5.2 with χ = 1 and N1 = 1. We shall now write Lp(k, t) for Lp(x, t) (here
k = w(x)).

If w(x) is big enough, we know that fx must be a classical form of level prime to p [Pil12,

Th´eor`eme 1.1 (6)]. Then we know that the Euler factor at p of L(St(f ), s) is

g

(1 − φ(p)p−s)

Hence we can rewrite

(1 − φ(p)β−1

p,i p−s)(1 − φ(p)βp,ip−s).

The means that the two variables p-adic L-function vanishes on t = 1. In what follows we shall use
s as a variable rather than t; remember that t = k − g − s.
The following formula is a straightforward consequence of the vanishing along s = k − g − 1:

d

6.1. Some examples. In this last section we want to present some examples of the automorphic
representation of GSp4(Qp) which could be associated with a Siegel modular form of level Γ0(p)
and check whether our theorem applies or not.

We now consider an automorphic representation π which at p is isomorphic to the one labelled
IIIa in [RS07, Table A.1]. We see that it admits exactly two vectors invariant for Γ0(N ) ([RS07,
Table A.15], where Γ0(p) is called Si(p)) and the corresponding Satake parameters are respectively
χ(p), p−1 and χ−1(p), p−1; only one corresponds to a Up-ordinary Siegel form. The monodromy of
the corresponding Weil–Deligne representation is given by the following matrix [RS07, Table A.7,
§A.7]:

0

0 −1

From [RS07, Table A.10] we see that the factor E1 vanishes and the main theorem applies. Note
that the corresponding automorphic representation belongs to the family of twists of the Steinberg
representation for GL2 which has non zero Plancherel measure; we can than use [Shi12, Theorem
5.7] to deduce that there exists a weight 3 Siegel form with this local representation.

We now consider an automorphic representation π which at p is isomorphic to the one labelled IIa
in [RS07, Table A.1]; we see that it admits exactly one vector invariant for Γ0(N ). The monodromy
of the corresponding Weil–Deligne representation is given by

We see that the trivial zero here comes from the factor E2 and we can not deal with it.

In a third case, the one labelled IVb, the monodromy of the corresponding Weil–Deligne rep-
resentation is given by the same matrix as IIIa; hence our theorem would apply if a form f with

DERIVATIVE OF THE STANDARD p-ADIC L-FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH A SIEGEL FORM

18

this local representation exists (the Plancherel measure of this representation is 0 so the previous
theorem does not apply).
