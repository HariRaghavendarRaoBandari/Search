Three-Dimensional Multi-Tethered Satellite Formation

with the Elements Moving Along Lissajous Curves

D. Yarotsky∗

D. Pritykin‡

Abstract

This note presents a novel approach to maintain three-dimensional multi-tethered
satellite formation in space. For a formation consisting of a main body connected by
tethers with several deputy satellites (the so-called “hub-and-spoke” conﬁguration) we
demonstrate that under proper choice of the system’s parameters the deputy satellites
can move along Lissajous curves in the plane normal to the local vertical with all
tethers stretched; the total force due to the tension forces acting on the main satellite
is balanced in a way allowing it to be in relative equilibrium strictly below or strictly
above the system’s center of mass. We analyze relations between the system’s essential
parameters and obtain conditions under which the proposed motion does take place.
We also study analytically the motion stability for diﬀerent conﬁgurations and whether
the deputy satellites can collide or the tethers can entangle. Our theoretical ﬁndings
are corroborated and validated by numerical experiments.

Introduction

Three-dimensional satellite formations are often discussed in connection with multi-point
measurements needed for atmospheric, geodetic or plasma physics studies. To simplify con-
trol strategies and to minimize fuel consumption, tethers can be used to maintain desired
relative positions of satellites in the formation ﬂying. For the ﬁrst time three-dimensional
multi-tethered formations were discussed probably by [6], who proposed double-pyramid con-
ﬁgurations. It seems that the most straightforward way to obtain a multi-tethered formation
is to deploy from the main satellite several tethers with deputy satellites at their ends. To

specify such formations [13] introduced the term “hub-and-spoke”. Behavior of “hub-and-
spoke” multi-tethered formations has been studied for diﬀerent dynamical environments: in
circular orbit [1, 4], in elliptic orbit [5], in halo-orbit [7, 18] and near collinear Lagrangian
points [17].

To keep the tethers taut the combination of rotation with gravity-gradient forces is usually
proposed. Among other opportunities the relatively new concept of the Tethered Coulomb
Structure (TCS) is worth mentioning [12,14,15]. In this case the satellites are electrostatically
charged to produce repulsive forces between them. Nevertheless, it looks as if Coulomb
repulsive forces can be used to prevent the slack of short enough tether: in [12, 14, 15] the
discussed length is 10 m by order of magnitude.

To give an idea of our approach we begin with the system of two bodies connected by
a single tether aligned along the local vertical; the mass center of the system moves in a
circular orbit. Small oscillations of this system around local vertical are a combination of
in-plane and out-of-plane natural oscillations with incommensurable frequencies [8, 16]. The
motion of end bodies in these oscillations can be roughly described as a motion along curves
densely ﬁlling certain areas on planes normal to the local vertical. Then let us consider the
degenerate “hub-and-spoke” conﬁguration in the relative equilibrium with all tethers aligned
along the vertical (Fig. 1, left) The displacement of a single deputy satellite from the relative
equilibrium position causes oscillations whose frequencies diﬀer from those inherent in the
preceding case. With the proper tuning of the system’s parameters these frequencies can be
made commensurable resulting in the motion of the deputy satellite along a Lissajous curve
in the plane, normal to the local vertical (Fig. 1, right). Naturally all other deputy satellites
can also be put in motion along similar curves. The choice of initial conditions allows to
avoid collisions among them and to ensure the balance of the tension forces applied to the
main satellite so as to preserve its relative equilibrium.

We suppose that the described structure can be useful for some applications or at least
become the starting point for the development of new approaches to maintain 3D multi-
tethered satellite formations in space.

In Section 2 we start our study with a simpliﬁed dynamical model of multi-tethered
formation (point masses + weightless tethers). In Section 3 we consider the linearized dy-
namics near vertical equilibrium and describe the oscillations in the system. In Section 4 we
consider deputy satellite formations moving along Lissajous curves. In Section 5 we present
the results obtained by numerical simulation of the system’s dynamics.

2 Deputy satellite dynamics at small deviations from

the relative equilibrium

As mentioned in the Introduction, we will consider the multi-tethered satellite formation
comprising N +1 bodies: the main satellite C of mass mC and N deputy satellites D1, ..., DN
(each of mass mD) linked to the main satellite (but not to each other) by identical extensible
tethers; the tethers’ masses are ignored.

Figure 1: Multi-tethered formation consisting of the main body C and three deputy
satellites D1, D2, D3. On the left the system is in relative equilibrium with all tethers
aligned along the local vertical. On the right the deputy satellites move along a Lis-
sajous curve (see also the animation provided as Electronic Supplementary Material).

To write down the equations of motion, we shall introduce a Local Vertical Local Hori-
zontal (LVLH) reference frame Oxyz, centered on the position of the system’s center of mass
(CoM) in its nominal orbital motion: Oz axis is aligned with the local vertical and oriented
towards Earth’s center, Ox runs tangentially to the orbit in the direction of the CoM motion,
and Oy axis is directed along the normal line to the orbit plane (Fig. 1). It is assumed that
nominally the system’s center of mass moves in circular orbit with the mean motion ω0. The
unit vectors in the directions of the axes x, y, z will be denoted as ex, ey, ez respectively.

In the LVLH frame the motion of any satellite in the considered formation can be de-

scribed by the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations [9]:

¨x = 2ω0 ˙z + Tx/m,
¨y = ω2
0y + Ty/m,
¨z = −2ω0 ˙x + 3ω2

0z + Tz/m,

(1)

where Tx, Ty, Tz denote the components of the (total) tether tension T applied to a given
body of mass m.

We shall adopt the usual visco-elastic model of massless tether, hence the tension force

applied to the ith deputy satellite is

Here and below equilibrium quantities are marked by the asterisk *. In contrast to the
y and z coordinates, the x coordinate in this conﬁguration, though shared by all satellites,
is arbitrary, since the equations are invariant with respect to translations along the orbit
(i.e., along the x axis in the approximation of the orbital dynamics, provided by the HCW
equations).

For the above conﬁguration to be valid the denominator in the last formula must be

It is not diﬃcult to derive an approximate expression for the tension forces in case of small
displacements of the main satellite and the ith deputy satellite with respect to equilibrium

3 Decoupling the equations of motion

The system of equations derived above can be split up into three independent groups by
taking appropriate linear combinations, separately for x, y and z components:

1. By taking the sum of the equation for the main satellite with weight mC and all the
respective equations for deputy satellites with weights mD we obtain a triple of scalar
equations for

i.e., for the motion of the whole system’s center of mass.

2. By taking the sum of the equations for deputy satellites with coeﬃcients 1/N and
subtracting from it the equation for the main satellite we obtain a triple of scalar
equations for

lites’ center of mass.

some coeﬃcients σi such that (cid:80)N
for (cid:80)N

if we take any linear combination of equations for deputy satellites with
i=1 σi = 0, we obtain a triple of scalar equations
i=1 σi∆ri, which can be interpreted as a partial description of the relative mo-
tion between deputy satellites. To obtain the full description, we need to consider all
N − 1 linearly independent such assignments of coeﬃcients, thus giving the total of
3(N − 1) scalar equations. The simplest example of the set with suitable combinations
of coeﬃcients is

{−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0},{0,−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0}, . . . ,{0, . . . ,−1, 1}.

Physically it means that we use relative displacements ∆ri+1 − ∆ri(i = 1, N − 1) of
consecutive objects to describe the dynamics of the subsystem composed of the deputy
satellites. One more opportunity is provided by the set

characterizing relative displacements of the deputy satellites D1, . . . , D(N−1) with re-
spect to the center of mass of all deputy satellites.

Clearly, the collection of these three groups of equations is equivalent to the original
system of 3(N + 1) scalar equations for the main and deputy satellites. Let us deal with the
three groups one by one.

3.1 System CoM motion equations

The motion of the system’s center of mass is described by free HCW equations [9]. It is
well-known that these equations describe oscillations with frequency ω0 in the y component,
and oscillations with frequency ω0 combined with a linear drift in the orbital xz plane.

3.2 Relative motion between the main satellite and the deputy

satellites’ center of mass

Let ∆x, ∆y, ∆z denote the scalar components of 1
N

i=1 ∆ri− ∆rC. Then using relation (5)

oscillations with the frequency 2ω0. To analyze the remaining equations for ∆x, ∆z we
consider the corresponding ﬁrst-order system

The symbol I4 is used here for the identity matrix of the fourth order. Applying the
Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion [10], it is not diﬃcult to establish that all eigenvalues ρ of
A belong to the left half-plane Reρ < 0 iﬀ the condition (4) is satisﬁed and b > 0.

Summarizing, under the stability assumption (4) the center of mass of deputy satellites
oscillates with respect to the main satellite; in the linear approximation the energy dissipation
in tethers does not aﬀect the oscillations along the y axis.

3.4 Lyapunov function

Our solution of the linearized dynamics implies, in particular, that in the linear approxima-
tion of tether tension the vertical equilibrium is stable. This conclusion can also be shown in
a stronger sense – without linearization of tether tension – by directly providing a Lyapunov
function. Speciﬁcally, let r(cid:48) = r − rCoM , ˙r(cid:48) = ˙r − ˙rCoM denote position and velocity relative
to the system’s center of mass. Consider the energy E = T + V of relative motion, where

4 Motion of deputy satellites along Lissajous curves

Having described oscillations of the “hub-and-spoke” system near the equilibrium, we con-
sider now the possibility of the satellites moving in such a way that the system elements
(satellites and tethers) never collide. Given our assumption of small deviations from the
vertical equilibrium, we formulate this as the requirement that the projections (xi, yi) of
deputy satellites to the xy plane never come close to each other.

Results of Section 3.3 imply that the position of a deputy satellite relative to the center

of mass of all deputy satellites,

r(cid:48)

oscillates with frequency

3.2, the center of mass of deputy satellites 1

N
may ignore these latter and assume without loss of generality that

at all times.

By linearity, for each pair i, j of deputy satellites their relative position ri − rj also
oscillates with the same frequencies ωx, ωy.
If the frequencies are incommensurate, i.e.,
ωx/ωy is irrational, then the trajectory of the oscillation is aperiodic and it comes arbitrarily
close to the origin, i.e. the two satellites come arbitrarily close to each other. We are thus
naturally led to consider commensurate oscillations:

ωx
ωy

=

p
q

,

(20)

where p, q are co-prime natural numbers. In this case the two oscillations have a common
period of

TL =

2πp
ωx

=

2πq
ωy

.

It is convenient to introduce the non-dimensional time

τ =

t
TL

.

The xy-motion of a single deputy satellite can then be written as

x = x0 sin (2πpτ + ϕx) , y = y0 sin(2πqτ + ϕy),

(21)

with some initial phases ϕx, ϕy, and has a period 1. The trajectory of this motion is known
as a Lissajous curve [3, Sec. 25]

Substituting expressions (17), (18) for ωx, ωy into formula (20), we obtain the following

relation between the frequency ratio and the satellite mass ratio:

N mD
mC

=

3q2

p2 − 4.

In particular, positivity of the left-hand side entails

.

(22)

We remark in passing that this condition excludes the usual elliptic (or circular) oscilla-

tions corresponding to p = q = 1.

The frequencies ωx, ωy can then be expressed in terms of p and q:

4.1 Balanced formations avoiding collisions

We seek now formations of deputy satellites moving according to (21) subject to the following
conditions:

A. The arrangement of deputy satellites must satisfy the balance condition (19);

B. The satellites must never collide, i.e.

(xi(t), yi(t)) (cid:54)= (xj(t), yj(t))

for all t and i (cid:54)= j;

C. Optionally, we may wish to ensure that

(xi(t), yi(t)) (cid:54)= (0, 0)

for all i and t – in this case an additional satellite can be added at the center of the
“hub-and-spoke” system without collisions with this system.

We consider two types of uniform arrangement of deputy satellites. Type I is a uniform
arrangement of N satellites along a single Lissajous curve: the position of the i’th deputy
satellite is given by

a) For a Type I formation, the balance condition A is fulﬁlled if and only if neither p nor

only if (ϕ0 + (p − q)/2) N is not divisible by the greatest common divisor of N and

a Type I formation satisﬁes condition C iﬀ ϕ0 is not an integer. A Type II formation
satisﬁes condition C iﬀ ϕ0 is not of the form a + 2b(q − p)/N with integer a, b.

The proof of Proposition 1 is given in Appendix A. Note that, given p, q, admissible
formations (satisfying all three conditions A-C) exist for all N = 2, 3, . . . in case of Type II,
but not for all N in case of Type I.

4.2 Entanglement

Practical implementation of the introduced formations requires to resolve another issue. The
tethers’ ends are not attached to the main satellite at exactly the same point. Even if the
tethers are connected very close to each other, they still have nonzero thickness. Relative
motion of satellites in formations of Type I and Type II may cause not only contacts between
the tethers, but also tethers entanglement.

We will distinguish two kinds of entanglement: one that can be canceled out by rotating
the main satellite about the z axis as shown in Fig. 3a, and one that can not be eliminated by
such rotations (Fig. 3b). These two kinds will be referred to as weak and strong entanglement,
respectively.

We can deﬁne entanglement rigorously by applying simple topological concepts [2] to the
dynamics of the deputy satellites. Consider the motion of a deputy satellites formation as a

where Rϕ(α) is the rotation of the satellite positions in the xy plane by continuously varying
angles ϕ(α) common to all deputy satellites, for some choice of the continuous function ϕ(α).
We then say that M0 is strongly entangled if M0 is not weakly homotopic to M1.

The above deﬁnitions do not involve the main satellite. We assume that the initial state
is non-entangled, and the geometry of the tether attachment points to the main satellite is
reﬂected in the initial positions of the deputy satellites as shown in Fig. 3.

An obvious example of a weak, but not strong entanglement results from a circular motion
as shown in Fig. 3a. Also note that a motion of N = 2 deputy satellites is never strongly
entangled but may be weakly entangled.

By considering a few simple examples, it is easy to see that entanglement does take place
in some formations of Type I and Type II and does not in others. For instance, there is a
strong braid-like entanglement for the Type I formation with p = 1, q = 2, and N = 3 (top
left plot in Fig. 2), weak entanglement for the Type I formation with p = 1, q = 3, and
N = 2 (bottom left plot in Fig. 2), and no entanglement for the Type II formations with
N = 2 and p = 1, q = 2 or p = 2, q = 3, and N = 2 (top and bottom right plots in Fig. 2).
Complete analysis of entanglement in our formations appears to be relatively complex
mathematically, hence we will not attempt it here. We will, however, state a simple propo-
sition involving pairwise relations between satellites. Namely, for any pair (i, j) of deputy
satellites consider the winding number wi,j deﬁned as the number of turns that the j’th
satellite makes about the i’th satellite in the xy-plane over the period:

(cid:18) xj(τ ) − xi(τ )

M1, the numbers wi,j can serve to establish suﬃcient (but not necessary) conditions of
entanglement.

Proposition 2

a) Consider a formation of Type I or Type II moving without collisions. If at least one of
p, q is even, then wi,j = 0 for all pairs. Otherwise, wi,j = ±1 for all pairs.Consequently,
if both p, q are odd, then there is at least a weak entanglement.

b) Moreover, consider a formation of Type I and suppose that both p, q are odd so that
wi,j = ±1 by a). Then both values +1 and −1 are encountered among the winding
numbers wi,j iﬀ neither of the numbers q−p, q+p is divisible by 2N . As a consequence,
if neither of q − p, q + p is divisible by 2N , then the entanglement is not only weak,
but also strong.

Proposition 2 is proved in Appendix B. It leads to an expected result if applied to a
circular or elliptic motion (p = q = 1): part a) conﬁrms a weak entanglement, and part b)
ensures that all winding numbers are equal since p − q = 0, so the suﬃcient condition for a
strong entanglement is not fulﬁlled.
Note also that for odd p, q one of the numbers q − p, q + p is always divisible by 4, so
statement b) agrees with our earlier remark that there can be no strong entanglement for
N = 2.

4.3 Second order perturbation theory

In contrast to the general stability of the “hub-and-spoke” system established in Section
3.4 in the sense of smallness of deviation from the vertical equilibrium, we do not expect
the motion of deputy satellites along Lissajous curves to be stable. This motion is a subtle
phenomenon which, in particular, is strongly aﬀected by nonlinearities and can be maintained
without additional control action only at relatively small oscillation amplitudes.

In this section we examine the nonlinearity eﬀects by deriving second order corrections to
0mD (cid:29) 1 when one can neglect the tethers’ extensibility
the evolution equations in case k/3ω2
and put l0 = l∗. If we assume that the center of mass of the system rests at the origin, then
the conﬁguration can be parametrized by the 2N coordinates xi, yi, i = 1, .., N, of the

The obtained equations can be used to ﬁnd anharmonic corrections to a particular small
harmonic oscillation. The usual procedure is to substitute the harmonic oscillation in the
right-hand side and ﬁnd the correction, to leading order, by solving the resulting non-
homogeneous linear equation [11]. If the right-hand side contains secular terms, i.e., those
whose frequencies match some of the eigenfrequencies of the linear equation, then, addition-
ally, the solution’s frequencies need to be adjusted to prevent its non-physical growth.

In the case at hand we take the motion of a Type I or II formation with a small amplitude
as a base harmonic oscillation that we denote xi,0 (t) , yi,0 (t). From the balance condition
(19) we have xC (t) = yC(t) ≡ 0, so that the evolution equations simplify to

˙yk,0yk,0, and ˙xi,0yi,0 on
the right-hand side result in oscillations with frequencies 2ωx, 2ωy, and ωy ± ωx, respectively.
Though the second order correction of motion is obviously present for each deputy satellite
for any choice of system parameters, it is possible to choose parameters so as to make the
second order correction completely vanish for the main satellite. The evolution equations for
the main satellite are derived by adding up the equations for the deputy satellites:

second order corrections much stronger than the motion of the deputy satellites. However,
contributions from diﬀerent j’s here may cancel out.

The proof is elementary, and we omit it. Examples of parameter sets fulﬁlling the propo-
sition’s hypothesis are N = 5, p = 1, q = 2 and N = 5, p = 3, q = 4. Our numerical
experiments below conﬁrm that in these cases the main satellite is indeed stable in contrast
to the generic settings at the same oscillation amplitude of deputy satellites.

5 Examples and numerical simulations

5.1 Setup and general observations

In our numerical simulations we consider oscillations of the system with rigid tether at small
angles and with equal amplitudes in x and y:

x0 = y0 = a = κradl0

Here a is the linear amplitude and κrad is the corresponding angular amplitude expressed
in radians; the same angular amplitude expressed in degrees is denoted κdeg.
In all our
experiments the dimensionless coeﬃcient k/3ω2
0mD characterizing tether rigidity falls in
the range [3 · 102, 103] and κdeg ≤ 6◦ (to justify the above linear relation between a and
κrad). In order to numerically examine the stability of the Lissajous motion we introduce
quantities characterizing relative deviations of the main and deputy satellites from their
theoretical positions obtained in the linear approximation. Speciﬁcally, we consider the
relative deviation of the main satellite’s numerically computed position from the z axis

(cid:113)

δC(t) =

and the mean relative deviation of the deputy satellites’ numerically found trajectories from
the theoretical Lissajous curves:

(xi,num(t) − xi,Liss(t))2 + (yi,num(t) − yi,Liss(t))2

(cid:113)

N(cid:88)

(cid:113)

These quantities can be compared with the minimum distance between diﬀerent deputy
satellites on their theoretical trajectories:

δmin =

1
a

min
t,i(cid:54)=j

(xi,Liss(t) − xj,Liss(t))2 + (yi,Liss(t) − yj,Liss(t))2

Here we neglect the diﬀerence in z coordinates of the deputy satellites since for small ampli-
tude oscillations this diﬀerence has higher order of smallness.

If each satellite remains at all times within a distance of δmin/2 from its theoretical
position on the Lissajous curve, then all satellites are guaranteed to avoide collisions. We
will consider a slightly relaxed condition of stability

δD(t) <

δmin
2

18

(24)

that constrains only the mean deviation δD(t) of the deputy satellites. The time interval
during which this condition holds can be roughly considered as a “system stability interval”.
We restrict ourselves to the simplest ratio ωx : ωy = 1 : 2 achieved at p = 1, q = 2. In

this case, the theoretical mass ratio is

N mD
mC

= 8,

and the full period TL of system oscillations is related to the orbital period T0 = 1/(2πω0)
by

q2 − p2T0 =

√
3T0,

so that the non-dimensional time

TL =

(cid:112)

τ =

t√
3T0

.

We consider the three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the system shown in the ﬁrst row of
Fig. 2. For each conﬁguration, we perform simulations for κdeg = 1◦ and κdeg = 3◦ for 10
orbital periods. In our simulations, the central satellite moves along a geostationary orbit,
and tether length l0 = 10000 m.

Figure 4: Numerically observed relative deviations of the satellites from the theoretical
trajectories for the Type I formation with N = 3 deputy satellites. In this case the
minimum relative distance between deputy satellites on the theoretical trajectories is
δmin = 0.60. At κdeg = 1◦ stability condition (24) holds with a large margin for the
whole simulation interval of 10 orbital periods, while at κdeg = 3◦ it breaks down after
six orbital periods.

main satellite are initially much larger than those of the deputy satellites. This is not
surprising, since the main satellite is eight times lighter. However, deviations of the deputy
satellites approximately linearly accumulate with time, and eventually catch up with those
In case κdeg = 3◦ relative deviations are much larger than in case
of the main satellite.
κdeg = 1◦: approximately three times larger for δC and six times larger for δD. The second
order perturbation theory in Section 4.3 suggests a linear dependence of relative deviations
on κdeg, but for κdeg = 3◦ deviations of the main satellite from the equilibrium position
are already comparable to the oscillation amplitude, so this perturbation theory is not truly
applicable here. In case κdeg = 1◦ the stability condition (24) holds with a large margin for
the whole simulation interval, while at κdeg = 3◦ it breaks down after six orbital periods.

Figure 5: Deviations for Type I and N = 5. In this case δmin = 0.43. Stability condition
(24) holds with a large margin for the whole simulation interval of 10 orbital periods
for both κdeg = 1◦ and κdeg = 3◦.

The results for Type I formation at N = 5 (Fig. 5) are drastically diﬀerent due to
the cancellation of second order corrections of the main satellite’s motion pointed out in
Proposition 3. Not only is the main satellite almost immobile, but also the deviations of the
deputy satellites are from two to four times smaller than in the previous case. In particular,
the no-collision condition (24) holds at κdeg = 3◦ throughout the whole simulation interval.
Note also that in the κdeg = 3◦ case the deviations of deputy satellites are approximately
three times as large as in the κdeg = 1◦ case, in good agreement with the second order
perturbation theory which is now applicable since the deviations are small.

Results in the case of Type II formation at N = 2 (Fig. 6) are on the whole similar to

those obtained in the ﬁrst case (Type I, N = 3). The deviations are in fact now higher than
in that case, but this is somewhat compensated by the larger δmin, so that the no-collision
condition at κdeg = 3◦ again holds about up to the half of the simulation interval.

5.2 Frequency adjustment by tuning the mass ratio

The speciﬁc pattern of deviation growth observed in the above examples (linear growth in
time with superimposed periodicity) strongly suggests that this growth is largely due to the
gradual shift of the trajectories occurring because the ratio of the true x and y system’s
frequencies does not exactly match the approximate value α0 = N mD/mC = 8. We can
expect to negate these shifts by adjusting the mass ratio:

N mD
mC

= α0 − ∆α.

We ﬁnd the appropriate ∆α numerically, by minimizing the maximum deviation of deputy

satellites for 10 orbital periods:

We perform these optimizations at diﬀerent angles κdeg for the second, most stable con-

6 Conclusions

We found that subject to appropriate choice of “hub-and-spoke” system parameters deputy
satellites can move along Lissajous curves so that the system stays in free motion (i.e. no
fuel is consumed in the nominal operation mode). The main satellite is in a state of relative
equilibrium on the local vertical, passing through the system CoM.

Our analysis shows the existence of rather nontrivial relations between the system’s
parameters that, when satisﬁed, produce a well-balanced system without collisions between
the deputy satellites or tethers. Certain conﬁgurations determined by the proper choice of
parameters allow placing an additional satellite at the center of the “hub-and-spoke” system
without collisions with the other parts of the system.

Of course, the intricate way in which the deputy satellites change their positions is chal-
lenging for technical implementation. In particular, the tethers must be attached to the main
satellite so as not to intertwine. Analysis of the tether entanglement in terms of homotopy
provides another set of constraints that the system parameters should satisfy.

One of the most curious results in this paper is the study of nonlinear eﬀects, which
allows to formulate yet another set of conditions for the systems parameters to cancel out
the second order corrections in the systems’ equations of motion. Our numerical experiments
with two parameter sets (for 5 deputy satellites) satisfying these conditions corroborate the
theoretically predicted system’s stability

The application of the proposed motion pattern is limited to small angular deviations of

the tethers from the local vertical. The possibility to extend it to large deviations from the
vertical could be a subject of further investigation.

Statements a) and d) are very simple, so we only provide proofs for b) and c).

b) Suppose that the satellite i collides with the satellite j at the time moment τ . The

condition xi(τ ) = xj(τ ) admits two series of solutions:

1. 2πp(cid:0)τ + i
2. 2πp(cid:0)τ + i

The condition yi(τ ) = yj(τ ) has similar series but with q instead of p, ϕy instead of ϕx

and ny instead of nx.

Thus there are four possibilities for the satellites to collide: an element in series 1 or
2 for the coordinate x must occur simultaneously with an element in series 1 or 2 for the
coordinate y. Let us deal with these cases one by one.

1. Series 1 for x and series 1 for y – impossible because p and q are co-prime and −N <

i − j < N .

2. Series 2 for x and series 1 for y. Series 1 for y has non-trivial solutions iﬀ N and q are
not co-prime. If a non-trivial solution exists, the time moment τ is found from series
2 for x. Thus in this series collisions occur iﬀ N and q are not co-prime.

3. Series 1 for x and series 2 for y. Similarly, collisions occur iﬀ N and p are not co-prime.

4. Series 2 for x and series 2 for y. Equating τ from both series, we obtain

Since p and q are co-prime, with nx, ny running over all possible integers, the left side
also runs over all possible integers, i.e. collisions in this case happen iﬀ the right side is an
integer.

c) Like in the proof of b), we obtain two series of relations from the condition xi(τ ) =xj(τ ).

However, the ﬁrst series takes the form

i − j
N

=nx

and has no non-trivial solutions, because −N <i− j<N . This leaves the second series, which
has the form

Like before, we equate τ from the series for x and y and obtain

whence

N (qnx − pny) − (q − p) (i + j) =

As nx, ny run over all integer values, the expression qnx−pny also takes all integer values.
If N ≥ 3, the sum i + j for all possible pairs of diﬀerent numbers from 1 to N assumes all
possible integer values modulo N . Thus the expression in the left side takes all possible
integer values divisible by the greatest common divisor of N and q − p. On the other hand,
if N = 2, then i + j = 3 and the above relation simpliﬁes to the requirement that

qϕx − pϕy

π

be integer.

Appendix B Proof of Proposition 2

a) For a closed curve (x (τ ) , y(τ ))τ∈[0,1] not containing the origin, the number w of its rota-
tions about the origin can be written as

(cid:88)

τ :y(τ )=0

w =

1
2

sign (x (τ ) ˙y (τ )),

assuming that the intersections of the curve with the x coordinate axis are non-degenerate.
We will apply this formula to

xij (τ ) = xj (τ ) − xi (τ ) , yij (τ ) = yj (τ ) − yi (τ ) .

We consider separately the two types of formations.

(cid:19)

We have

y∗ (τ ) = 0 for τ =

s − ϕy

, s = 1, ..2q.

Moreover, with this choice of τ we have ˙y∗ (τ ) > 0 for even s and ˙y∗ (τ ) < 0 for odd s.

Applying the formula for the winding number, we obtain

with some (unimportant) phase constant ϕ∗.

Now consider separately the cases when both p, q are odd and when one of them is even.
Let both p, q be odd. Since p, q are co-prime, the values (πps/q)mod 2π run over the

r=0 as s runs over 1, 2, .., 2q. Then the quantity cos

values in the set Z2q = {πr/q}2q−1
q + ϕ∗
takes equally many positive and negative values as s runs over 1, 2, .., 2q. Now, if s runs only
over even values 2, .., 2q, then (πps/q)mod 2π runs over the values in the set Zq = {2πr/q}q−1
r=0.
Then, since q is odd, the number of positive and negative values taken by cos
,
as s runs only even values 2, .., 2q, diﬀers by 1. It follows that

q + ϕ∗

w∗ =

1
2

(±1 − (∓1)) = ±1.

Now let one of p, q be even; without loss of generality we can assume that it is q. We can

then repeat the above argument, but since q is now even, we conclude that cos
takes equally many negative and positive values as s runs over the even or odd subset of
1, 2.., 2q. It follows that w∗ = 1

2 (0 − 0) = 0.

q + ϕ∗

We have thus proved statement a) for Type I formation.

in case of Type I.

b) From the proof of a), wi,j = w∗sign (x0y0) sign(fj−i), where we set

Note ﬁrst that if q − p is divisible by 2N , then fs = sin2 (πps/N ) > 0 for all s not divisible
by N (recall that N and p are co-prime by the assumption of no collisions). Accordingly,
wi,j = w∗sign (x0y0) for all i, j = 1, .., N with i (cid:54)= j. Similarly, wi,j = −w∗sign (x0y0) if q + p
is divisible by 2N .
Now suppose that neither of q − p, q + p is divisible by 2N . We need to show that fs
takes both positive and negative values as s runs over 1, 2, .., N − 1. Since fN = f0 = 0 and
s=0 fs = 0. But that immediately follows from the

f2N−s = fs, it suﬃces to show that (cid:80)2N−1

The presence of strong entanglement follows from the presence of diﬀerent winding numbers,
since under a weak homotopy the winding number (possibly nonzero) must be the same for
all pairs.
