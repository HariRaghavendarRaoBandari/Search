characters are Schubert polynomials. In a previous work the author showed that
the tensor product of KP modules always has a KP ﬁltration, i.e. a ﬁltration
whose each successive quotients are isomorphic to KP modules. In this paper
we explicitly construct such ﬁltrations for certain special cases of these tensor

product modules, namely Sw ⊗ Sd(K i) and Sw ⊗Vd(K i), corresponding to Pieri

and dual Pieri rules for Schubert polynomials.

1 Introduction

Schubert polynomials are one of the main subjects in algebraic combinatorics.
One of the tools for studying Schubert polynomials is the modules introduced
by Kra´skiewicz and Pragacz. These modules, which here we call KP modules,
are modules over the upper triangular Lie algebra and have the property that
their characters with respect to the diagonal matrices are Schubert polynomials.
It is known that a product of Schubert polynomials is always a positive
sum of Schubert polynomials. The previously known proof for this positivity
property uses the geometry of the ﬂag variety. In [8] the author showed that
the tensor product of two KP modules always has a ﬁltration by KP modules
and thus gave a representation-theoretic proof for this positivity. Although the
proof there does not give explicit constructions for the KP ﬁltrations, it may
provide a new viewpoint for the notorious Schubert-LR problem asking for a
combinatorial positive rule for the coeﬃcient in the expansion of products of
Schubert polynomials into a sum of Schubert polynomials.

There are some cases where the expansions of products of Schubert poly-
nomials are explicitly known. Examples of such cases include the Pieri and
the dual Pieri rules for Schubert polynomials ([1], [6], [7], [10]). These are the
cases where one of the Schubert polynomials is a complete symmetric function
hd(x1, . . . , xi) or an elementary symmetric function ed(x1, . . . , xi). The purpose
of this paper is to investigate the structure of tensor product modules corre-
sponding to these products and to give explicit constructions of KP ﬁltrations
for these modules.

The structure of this paper is as follows.

In Section 2 we prepare some
deﬁnitions and results on Schubert polynomials and KP modules. In Section
3 we review the Pieri and the dual Pieri rules for Schubert polynomials.
In
Section 4 we give explicit constructions for KP ﬁlrartions of the corresponding

tensor product modules Sw ⊗ Sd(K i) and Sw ⊗Vd(K i). In Section 5 we give a

proof of the main result.

2 Preliminaries

Let N be the set of all positive integers. By a permutation we mean a bijec-
tion from N to itself which ﬁxes all but ﬁnitely many points. The graph of a
permutation w is the set {(i, w(i)) : i ∈ N} ⊂ N2. For i < j, let tij denote the
permutation which exchanges i and j and ﬁxes all other points. Let si = ti,i+1.
For a permutation w, let ℓ(w) = #{i < j : w(i) > w(j)}. For a permutation w
and positive integers p < q, if ℓ(wtpq) = ℓ(w) + 1 we write wtpq ⋗ w. It is well
known that this condition is equivalent to saying that w(p) < w(q) and there
exists no p < r < q satisfying w(p) < w(r) < w(q). For a permutation w let
I(w) = {(i, j) : i < j, w(i) > w(j)}.

For a polynomial f = f (x1, x2, . . .) and i ∈ N deﬁne ∂if = f −sif
xi−xi+1

. For a
permutation w we can assign its Schubert polynomial Sw ∈ Z[x1, x2, . . .] which
is recursively deﬁned by

• Sw = xn−1

xn−2

· · · xn−1 if w(1) = n, w(2) = n − 1, . . . , w(n) = 1 and

w(i) = i (i > n) for some n, and

• Swsi = ∂iSw if ℓ(wsi) < ℓ(w).

Hereafter let us ﬁx a positive integer n. Let

S(n) = {w : permutation, w(n + 1) < w(n + 2) < · · · }.

Note that if w ∈ S(n) then I(w) ⊂ {1, . . . , n} × N. Let K be a ﬁeld of charac-
teristic zero. Let b = bn denote the Lie algebra of all n × n upper triangular
matrices over K. For a b-module M and λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Zn, let Mλ =

M is a direct sum of these Mλ and these Mλ are ﬁnite dimensional then we

{m ∈ M : hm = hλ, him (∀h = diag(h1, . . . , hn))} where hλ, hi = Pi λihi. If
say that M is a weight module and we deﬁne ch(M ) = Pλ dim Mλxλ where

xλ = xλ1
(i, j)-th position and all other coordinates 0.

Let U be a vector space spanned by a basis {uij : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, j ∈ N}. Let

module Sw (or the KP module for short) associated to w is the b-submodule

T =L∞
d=0Vd U . The Lie algebra b acts on U by epquij = δiqepj and thus on T .
For w ∈ S(n) let uw =V(i,j)∈I(w) uij ∈Vℓ(w) U ⊂ T . The Kra´skiewicz-Pragacz
of Vℓ(w) U ⊂ T generated by uw. In [5] Kra´skiewicz and Pragacz showed the

following:

Theorem 2.1 ([5, Remark 1.6 and Theorem 4.1]). Sw is a weight module and
ch(Sw) = Sw.

Example 2.2. If w = si, then uw = ui,i+1 ∈ U and thus Sw =L1≤j≤i Kuj,i+1 ∼=
L1≤j≤i Kuj =: K i on which b acts by epquj = δqjup.

A KP ﬁltration of a b-module M is a ﬁltration 0 = M0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Mr = M

such that each Mi/Mi−1 is isomorphic to some KP module.

3 Pieri and dual Pieri rules for Schubert poly-

nomials

Deﬁnition 3.1. For w ∈ S∞, i ≥ 1 and d ≥ 0, let

Xi,d(w) = {tp1q1 tp2q2 · · · tpdqd : pj ≤ i, qj > i, w1⋖w2⋖· · · , w1(p1) < w2(p2) < · · · }

and

Yi,d(w) = {tp1q1 tp2q2 · · · tpdqd : pj ≤ i, qj > i, w1⋖w2⋖· · · , w1(q1) > w2(q2) > · · · }

where w1 = w, w2 = wtp1q1 , w3 = wtp1q1 tp2q2 , · · · .

Note that the condition for Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w)) implies that q1, . . . , qd

(resp. p1, . . . , pd) are all diﬀerent.

Theorem 3.2 (Conjectured in [1] and proved in [10], also appears with diﬀerent
formulations in [6] and [7]). We have

and

Sw · hd(x1, . . . , xi) = Xζ∈Xi,d(w)

Swζ

Sw · ed(x1, . . . , xi) = Xζ∈Yi,d(w)

Swζ

where hd and ed denote the complete and elementary symmetric functions re-
spectively.

1 The formulation of dual Pieri rule here is slightly diﬀerent from the one in [1] but they

are easily shown to be equivalent.

Note here that the permutation ζ ∈ Xi,d(w) (or Yi,d(w)) in fact uniquely
determines its decomposition into transpositions satisfying the conditions in
Deﬁnition 3.1. So we can write, without ambiguity, for example “for ζ =
tp1q1 · · · tpdqd ∈ Xi,d(w) deﬁne (something) as (some formula involving pj and
qj)”. Hereafter if we write such we will always assume the conditions in Deﬁni-
tion 3.1.

KP ﬁltration. Since Sd(K i) and Vd(K i) (1 ≤ i ≤ n, d ≥ 1) are special cases of
KP modules, Sw ⊗ Sd(K i) and Sw ⊗Vd(K i) (w ∈ S(n)) have KP ﬁltrations. In
ua2b2 ∧ · · · ) =Pk(· · · ∧ δpbk uakq ∧ · · · ). Let these operators act on T ⊗ Sd(K i)
and T ⊗ Vd(K i) by applying them on the left-hand side tensor component.
Also for j ≥ 1 deﬁne an operator µj : T ⊗Na(K i) → T ⊗Na−1(K i) (a ≥ 1)
(1 ≤ p ≤ i). We denote the restrictions of µj to T ⊗ Sa(K i) and T ⊗Va(K i)
(seen as submodules of T ⊗Na(K i)) by the same symbol. Note that e′
µj give b-endomorphisms on T ⊗ S•(K i) and T ⊗V•(K i).

For a permutation z and positive integers p < q let mpq(z) = #{r > q :
qp(z) = #{r < p : z(p) < z(r) < z(q)}. For

if there exists a k such that u(j) = v(j) for all j < k (resp. j > k) and
u(k) < v(k).

Proposition 4.1. For ζ, ζ ′ ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w)),

• φζ (vζ ) is a nonzero multiple of uwζ ∈ T , and

• φζ′ (vζ ) = 0 if (wζ)−1 <
lex

(wζ ′)−1 (resp. (wζ)−1 <
rlex

(wζ ′)−1).

The proof for this proposition is given in the next section. Here we ﬁrst see

that Proposition 4.1 gives desired ﬁltrations.

For a b-module M and elements x, y, . . . , z ∈ M let hx, y, . . . , zi denote the
submodule generated by these elements. Consider the sequence of submodules

0 ⊂ hvζ1 i ⊂ hvζ1 , vζ2 i ⊂ · · · ⊂ hvζ : ζ ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w))i

inside Sw ⊗ Sd(K i) (resp. Sw ⊗ Vd(K i)), where ζ1, ζ2, . . . ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp.

Yi,d(w)) are all the elements ordered increasingly by the lexicographic (resp.
reverse lexicographic) ordering of (wζ)−1. From the proposition we see that
there are surjections hvζ1 , · · · , vζj i/hvζ1 , · · · , vζj−1 i ։ Swζj induced from φζj .
Thus we have

dim(Sw⊗Sd(K i)) ≥ dimhvζ : ζ ∈ Xi,d(w)i ≥ Xζ∈Xi,d(w)

dim Swζ = dim(Sw⊗Sd(K i))

and

d

dim(Sw⊗

^(K i)) ≥ dimhvζ : ζ ∈ Yi,d(w)i ≥ Xζ∈Yi,d(w)

dim Swζ = dim(Sw⊗

d

^(K i))

respectively, where the last equalities are by Proposition 3.2. So the equalities
must hold everywhere. Thus hvζ : ζ ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w))i = Sw ⊗ Sd(K i)

(resp. Sw ⊗Vd(K i)) and the surjections above are in fact isomorphisms. So, in

conclusion, we get from Proposition 4.1 the following:

5

Theorem 4.2. Let M = Sw ⊗ Sd(K i) (resp. Sw ⊗Vd(K i)). Deﬁne vζ and

φζ as above. Then M is generated by {vζ : ζ ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w))} as a
b-module and

0 ⊂ hvζ1 i ⊂ hvζ1 , vζ2 i ⊂ · · · ⊂ hvζ : ζ ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w))i

gives a KP ﬁltration of M , where ζ1, ζ2, . . . ∈ Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w)) are all the
elements ordered increasingly by the lexicographic (resp. reverse lexicographic)
ordering of (wζ)−1. The explicit isomorphism hvζ1 , · · · , vζj i/hvζ1 , · · · , vζj−1 i ∼=
Swζj is given by φζj deﬁned above.

Remark 4.3. In [9] we related KP modules with the notion of highest weight
categories ([3]) as follows. For Λ′ ⊂ Zn let CΛ′ be the category of weight bn-
modules whose weights are all in Λ′. Then if Λ′ is an order ideal with respect
to a certain ordering on Zn then CΛ′ has a structure of highest weight category
whose standard objects are KP modules. One of the axioms for highest weight
categories requires that the projective objects should have ﬁltrations by standard
objects.

It can be shown that the projective cover of the one dimensional bn-module
Kλ with weight λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Zn
is given by
Sλ1(K 1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Sλn (K n). Thus Theorem 4.2 gives a proof to the fact that
have KP ﬁltrations, which leads
the indecomposable projective modules in CZn
≥0
to a diﬀerent proof from the one in [9, §3] for the axiom mentioned above (we
do not need these results about highest weight structure for b-modules in the
proof of Theorem 4.2 which will be done below).

multiple of uwtpq .

q′p′ )m′

Proof. This is essentially the same as [9, Lemma 5.8].

Lemma 5.2. Let w be a permutation, i ≥ 1 and d ≥ 0. Let ζ = tp1q1 · · · tpdqd ∈
Xi,d(w) (resp. Yi,d(w)) and 1 ≤ a ≤ d. Suppose that there exists no b < a sat-
isfying pb = pa (resp. qb = qa). Then mpaqa (wa) = mpaqa (w) and m′
qapa (wa) =
m′

qapa (w) where wa = wtp1q1 · · · tpa−1qa−1 as in Deﬁnition 3.1.

Proof. We show the case ζ ∈ Xi,d(w): the other case can be treated similarly.
First note that p1, . . . , pa−1 6= pa by the hypothesis. Also, as we have remarked
before, q1, . . . , qa are all diﬀerent. Thus the proof is now reduced to the following
lemma.

Lemma 5.3. Let p < q, p′ < q′ and suppose

• {p, q} ∩ {p′, q′} = ∅, and

Proof. Let us begin with a simple observation: suppose there exist two rectan-
gles R1 and R2 with edges parallel to coordinate axes. Suppose that no two
edges of these rectangles lie on the same line. Then, checking all the possibilities
we see that

#(NW and SE corners of R1 lying inside R2) − #(NE and SW corners of R1 lying inside R2)
= #(NW and SE corners of R2 lying inside R1) − #(NE and SW corners of R2 lying inside R1).

First consider the case R1 = [p, q]×[w(p), w(q)] and R2 = [p′, q′]×[w(p′), w(q′)]
in the observation above. wtp′ q′ tpq ⋗ wtp′q′ ⋗ w implies that the ﬁrst term in
the left-hand side and the second term in the right-hand side vanish (here the
coordinate system is taken so that points with smaller coordinates go NW).
Thus all the terms must vanish. In particular the ﬁrst term on the right-hand
side vanishes and thus wtpq ⋗ w.

We have shown that none of the points (p, w(p)), (p, w(q)), (q, w(p)) and
(q, w(q)) lie in [p′, q′] × [w(p′), w(q′)]. Since mpq(w) (resp. mp′q′ (w)) is the
number of points of the graph of w lying inside the rectangle R′
1 = [q, M ] ×
[w(p), w(q)] (resp. R′
1 = [−M, p] × [w(p), w(q)]) for M ≫ 0 and the graphs of w
and wtp′q′ diﬀer only at the vertices of the rectangle R2 = [p′, q′]×[w(p′), w(q′)],
applying the observation to these rectangles shows the remaining claims.

Proof of Proposition 4.1.

Proof for Xi,d(w): We assume (wζ)−1 ≤

(wζ ′)−1 and show that φζ′ (vζ ) = 0
unless ζ ′ = ζ and φζ (vζ ) is a nonzero multiple of uwζ. Let ζ = tp1q1 · · · tpdqd and
