Living cells display a remarkable capacity to compartmentalize their functional biochemistry spa-
tially. A particularly fascinating example is the cell nucleus. Exchange of macromolecules between
the nucleus and the surrounding cytoplasm does not involve crossing a lipid bilayer membrane.
Instead, large protein channels known as nuclear pores cross the nuclear envelope and regulate the
passage of other proteins and RNA molecules. Together with associated soluble proteins, the nuclear
pores constitute an important transport system. Beyond simply gating diﬀusion, this system is able
to generate substantial concentration gradients, at the energetic expense of guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) hydrolysis. Abstracting the biological paradigm, we examine this transport system as a ther-
modynamic machine of solution demixing. Building on the construct of free energy transduction and
biochemical kinetics, we ﬁnd conditions for stable operation and optimization of the concentration
gradients as a function of dissipation in the form of entropy production.
In contrast to conven-
tional engineering approaches to demixing such as reverse osmosis, the biological system operates
continuously, without application of cyclic changes in pressure or other intrinsic thermodynamic
parameters.

Demixing of solutions is a diﬃcult thermodynamic
problem with important practical consequences[1]. Ex-
amples include the desalination of seawater, medical dial-
ysis, and chemical puriﬁcation.
In all of these pro-
cesses, free energy is consumed to balance the entropy
of mixing, which tends to keep a solution mixed. Typi-
cal engineering approaches to demixing involve applica-
tion of hydrostatic pressure (reverse osmosis), solution
exchange (dialysis), or phase change (crystallization or
distillation)[2, 3]. Moreover, these perturbations must
be applied cyclically. In this context living cells adopt
a fundamentally diﬀerent paradigm by establishing and
maintaining concentration gradients at steady-state with-
out employing a cyclical protocol[4, 5].

A prominent example of molecular separation is the eu-
karyotic cell nucleus, wherein the concentrations of many
proteins and RNA diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those in the
cell body (cytoplasm). These concentration gradients are
maintained by a transport system that shuttles molecular
cargo in and out via large protein channels known as nu-
clear pores[6, 7]. This system has been under intensive
study in the biological and biophysical literature[8, 9],
with particular emphasis on single-molecule interactions
at the pore itself[10–15].

Simple thermodynamic considerations make clear that
equilibrium pore-molecule interactions are insuﬃcient to
support concentration gradients in solution. Demix-

ing between two compartments cannot happen sponta-
neously but must be coupled to a free-energy source to
counteract the entropic forces favoring mixing[16]. Dif-
ferent from cyclic engines of man-made design in which
energy is pumped into the system by changing external
control parameters such as pressure and volume cycli-
cally, cellular machines rather operate under ﬁxed intrin-
sic parameters, with free-energy necessary for transport
comeing from a non-equilibrium distribution of energetic
small molecules such as ATP or GTP.

Nuclear transport relies on a special class of pro-
teins, called transport receptors (i.e. “importin”), that
shuttle large molecules between the cytoplasm and nu-
cleus through small portals perforating the nuclear mem-
brane, the so-called nuclear pores[8]. Nuclear pores al-
low water molecules, charged ions, and small molecules
to freely diﬀuse across the nuclear membrane. However,
the channel permeability of nuclear pores begins to drop
for proteins larger than about 20 kDa molecular weight
and by about 80 kDa, proteins must be actively trans-
ported across the nuclear membrane by binding importin
[12, 17]. Recognition between transport receptors and
their molecular cargo depends on the presence of partic-
ular amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization
signals[13, 18, 19]. Moreover, the aﬃnity between im-
portin and cargo can be regulated by a third entity, a
small GTP-binding protein called Ran[8, 20]. When as-
sociated with GTP (RanGTP), the Ran binds strongly
to importin; however, when Ran is associated with GDP
(RanGDP), it binds importin weakly. Ran interconverts
between these two forms through GTP hydrolysis and
GTP/GDP exchange facilitated by the GTPase activat-

dient? What’s the physical deﬁnition of transport eﬃ-
ciency? Can we ﬁnd an optimal working point and how
is that reconcile with the nonequilibrium nature of this
cell machine? To address these questions, it is helpful to
reformulate this problem in a thermodynamic language
and to infer from that the engineering aspects of nuclear
transport machinery. For consistency with the litera-
ture we retain the nomenclature of nuclear transport,
yet the aim is to understand the natural engineering in
a more abstract sense that might ultimately be imple-
mented synthetically.

In the thermodynamic formulation of biochemical ma-
chines, a central role is played by energy transduction in
a “futile cycle” among the components. This is roughly
analogous to heat ﬂow in a Carnot cycle. GTP hydroly-
sis on Ran serves as the power source for nuclear trans-
port (see Fig. 1). The importin receptor binds RanGTP
and a second receptor known as nuclear transport fac-
tor 2 (NTF2) binds speciﬁcally RanGDP. The forward
cycle takes RanGTP out to the cytoplasm and translo-
cates RanGDP back to the nucleus. Detailed balance is
broken by the distribution of RanGAP and RanGEF as
described above, so that the reverse cycle is scarcely pop-
ulated. The futile cycle is coupled to cargo transport via
the importin, which can bind alternatively RanGTP or
the cargo. The details of this biochemistry can be ab-
stracted into a simple model where free-energy from the
Ran cycle is transduced by importin to bias the steady-
state free cargo concentrations in the nuclear and cy-
toplasmic compartments (Fig.1). Note that while NTF2
transports only RanGDP, importin molecules participate
in both the futile cycle and the cargo accumulation.

The details of the biochemical reactions underlying nu-
clear transport are shown in Fig. 1B and can be modeled
using law of mass action (see Appendix) [24–26]. The
corresponding kinetic parameters can be found from the
literature and earlier kinetic models[22, 23], or can be
estimated from simple scaling arguments (see Appendix
for details of kinetic model). Numerical solutions are ob-
tained by solving all the coupled rate equations using
standard Runge-Kutta method. We emphasize that the
present aim is not so much to model the biological im-
plementation as to explore the generic function of the
thermodynamic machine. Relations between parameters
are therefore more important than speciﬁc values.

A useful measure of cargo demixing is the nuclear lo-
calization ratio, NL, deﬁned as the ratio between nuclear
and cytoplasmic cargo concentrations:
[C]nu/[C]cyto.
Note that the ratio deﬁnes a chemical potential, ∆µ =
−kBT ln [C]nu/[C]cyto. Fig. 2 shows the NL ratio as
a function of importin and NTF2 concentrations. The
most striking feature is that NL is maximum for interme-
diate levels of importin. Futhermore, the importin con-
centration at which the NL ratio is maximized, [Im∗], is
largely independent of the NTF2 concentration. To bet-
ter understand this phenomena, we performed the same
simulations at diﬀerent cargo concentrations. We found
that [Im∗] grows with [C]tot, and for all cargo concentra-

cargo accumulation is strongly favored and Ran GTP/GDP

derlying processes occur. (B) Details of molecular demixing

ing protein RanGAP and the Guanosine Exchange Factor
RanGEF, respectively [21]. These two proteins are spa-
tially localized in diﬀerent cellular compartments. Ran-
GAP is structurally bound to the cytoplasmic face of the
nuclear pore and RanGEF is bound to chromatin. This
generates a high concentration of RanGTP and RanGDP
in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively (see Fig.1).

These biochemical details suggest that the demixing
between the cytoplasm and nucleus is powered by trans-
ducing free energy from GTP hydrolysis through the in-
teractions of transport receptor with Ran. The trans-
port machinery has been formulated in terms of coupled
chemical kinetics[22, 23] but the energetics have not yet
been addressed.
In particular, we ask: How to relate
the rate of dissipation to the desired concentration gra-

tions it is largely independent of the NTF2 concentration
(see Fig. 3B). At ﬁrst sight it is surprising that augment-
ing the importin concentration, which literally increases
the the number of molecules that can transport cargo at
nucleus, actually decreases the localization ratio. This
instead reveals that excessive importin weakens the cou-
pling to the futile cycle, reﬂecting the dual role played by
importin in the nuclear transport machinery. Concretely,
importin not only transports cargo, but also couples the
transport system to the Ran futile cycle that serves as
the power source for demixing between the nucleus and
cytoplasm. This suggest that these observations reﬂect
thermodynamic constraints build into the design of the
nuclear transport machinery.

To understand the thermodynamics of nuclear trans-
port, we exploit the observation that dynamics of the
Ran futile cycle can be formulated as a nonequilibrium
Markov process. Since a nonequilibrium steady state
(NESS) essentially necessitates breaking the detailed bal-
ance in the underlying Markov process, the system has
a nonzero entropy production [16, 27, 28]. The entropy
production (EP) of the Markov process is the energy per
unit time (power) required to maintain this NESS, and,
therefore, it is equivalent to the energy consumed by the
biochemical circuit. In the Schnakenberg description, the
EP for a NESS is given by[29]

where pSS
is the steady state probability distribution of
state i while W (i, j) denotes the transition probability
from state i to state j.

In the context of the Ran futile cycle that powers nu-
clear transport, pSS
is simply the fraction of reactants
that participate in the transition reaction starting from
state i, while W (i, j) can be calculated from the relevant
kinetics rate constants. This entropy production gives a
direct measure of the power consumed by the underlying
biochemical circuit (i.e. the Ran futile cycle). FIG. 2B
shows EP for various importin and NTF2 concentrations.
It is clear that NL is maximized at intermediate levels of
the EP (see also FIG.7). Surprisingly, consuming more
power actually decreases the eﬃcacy of nuclear transport
as measured by the NL ratio. Again this reﬂects the op-
timization for coupling of the futile cycle to the measured
work (i.e. NL); on either side of optimum the extra dis-
sipation is wasted without contributing to NL. We also
calculated EP for various cargo concentrations as shown
in Fig. 3C. As the importin concentration increases (for a
given NTF2 level), EP ﬁrst drops to a minimum and then
peaks before slowly decaying. Nevertheless, the mini-
mum entropy production tracks approximately, but not
exactly, with [Im∗], the value at which the localization
ratio peaks (see FIG.7). This might suggest a workable
strategy for optimal demixing− having importin level at
around where EP is minimal.

This non-monotonic behavior in EP is a direct re-
sult of the dual role importin plays as the inbound car-

rier of cargo protein as well as the outbound carrier of
RanGTP. Powering the futile cycle requires that importin
bind RanGTP, whereas cargo transport requires importin
to bind cargo. This gives rise to an eﬀective competi-
tion between cargo and RanGTP to bind the importin
molecules, albeit in diﬀerent compartments (FIG.3A). A
simple analysis reveals that importin is much more likely
to be found bound to cargo than RanGTP and more
or so at intermediate importin level (FIG.5). Moreover,
this diﬀerence in the probability that importin is bound
to cargo or RanGTP is maximal at intermediate levels
of importin concentration where the EP is also maxi-
mum (FIG.3A ). Indeed, this can be inferred from simi-
lar behavior observed in the diﬀerence between two cor-
responding reaction ﬂuxes (see FIG.5). Thus, a further
increase of the importin concentration inhibits formation
of the RanGTP-importin complex and suppresses the ex-
port of RanGTP to the cytoplasm. Since the coupling
between energy source to the transport machine relies
highly on this process (i.e. RanGTP export), Ran fu-
tile cycle must dissipate more energy to maintain NESS,
leading to EP increase. Furthermore, the NL ratio de-
clines because RanGTP can no longer eﬀectively dis-
place cargo from the importin in the nucleus (FIG.3A).
Indeed, this basic picture is supported by the behavior
of various ﬂuxes as functions of importin concentration
(see Appendix and FIG.4 and FIG.8).

The energy needed to power nuclear transport is ex-
tracted from GTP hydrolysis. For this reason, we asked
how N L depends on the free GTP-GDP ratio, θ. This
ratio enters the kinetics through an eﬀective “free en-
ergy” Fθ := ln (θ) ( See reaction 2, 5 in FIG.4A,B and
appendix). A typical value is around θ ∼ 102[21, 30]. In-

cargo demixing is facilitated by hydrolysis of GTP, we
identify the relevant components the constitute the fu-
tile cycle and draw the connection between dissipation
of chemical energy and maintenance of the cargo concen-
tration gradient at non-equilibrium steady states. We
show that the eﬃcacy of nuclear localization ratio peaks
at intermediate importin level, which is not too far from
power consumption minimal. This permits a thermo-
dynamic deﬁnition of eﬃciency, rather than an ad hoc
measure via counting of single molecule transport events
as well as suggests a possible experimental test to our
model.

Our thermodynamic analysis of nuclear transport also
suggests several engineering design principles for design-
ing demixing machines that operate at steady-state with-
out a cyclic change in external parameters. The transport
of cargo must be coupled to non-equilibrium ﬂuxes that
result from the transport of an energetic switch that is
charged in one compartment (nucleus) and discharged in
a separate compartment (the cytoplasm). This ensures
that the nuclear transport machinery will be insensitive
to ﬂuctuations in the chemical potential of the raw energy
source (GTP) that powers transport. Furthermore, for a
given cargo concentration there exists an optimal concen-
tration of importin in terms of localization NL per dis-
sipated power EP. It is interesting to speculate whether
living cells maintain operation near such a working point.
This work is part of a larger literature that seeks to ex-
amine basic biophysical processes from a thermodynamic
perspective. It is now clear that thermodynamics funda-
mentally constrains the ability of cells to perform vari-
ous task ranging from detecting external signals[31–33],
to adaptation[34], to making ﬁdelity decisions[28], gen-
erating oscillatory behavior[35], and of course generating
forces and dynamic structures[36–38]. In all these exam-
ples, it is possible to map these tasks to Markov processes
and compute the corresponding entropy production rate.
This suggests that there may be general theorems about
thermal eﬃciency in cells that are independent of the
particular task under consideration [27, 39–41]. It will be
interesting to explore if this is actually the case and to see
if these principles can be applied to synthetic biology[39].

deed, our analysis reveals that a slight change of θ around
this typical value barely modify the NL and EP(FIG.6).
This can be understood mechanistically by noting that
the θ enters the futile cycle in two opposing ways. A
larger value of θ tends not only to drive the disassocia-
tion of NTF2-RanGDP complex but also to exalt the for-
mation of the importin-RanGTP complex, with roughly
equal magnitude (see Appendix B1, B2). From FIG. 1,
it is clear that these reactions tend to bias transport in
opposite directions. As a result, any enhancement of ﬂux
through the futile cycle in the forward reaction conferred
by increasing θ (i.e.
reaction 5 in FIG.4C) is roughly
balanced by the contradicting counterpart in preventing
cargo release (i.e. reaction 2 in FIG.4C).

In summary, we have analyzed the biological paradigm
for nuclear transport from a thermodynamic point of
view. Consistent with prior understanding that protein

Appendix A: Biophysical models

The 11 basic reactions constituting the whole transport process are depicted in Figure 4. Our model incorporates
known mechanism of nuclear transport of cargo through binding with importin and the active consumption of energy
through hydrolysis of GTP. Such process is facilitated by Ran’s intrinsic GTPase activity, which is activated through
Ran’s interaction with the Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP). In addition, we also include the reverse con-
version of RanGDP to RanGTP through the action of guanine Exchange Factor RCC1 (known as RanGEF) in our
model. One distinct feature of our model is in addition to the standard model of nuclear transport whose biochem-
istry is summarized below, we also incorporates the backward reactions to account for the reversibility nature of this
transport process[25].

• (Reaction 10, 9) At cytoplasm, say, compartment A, the complex form by importin protein (transport recep-
tor) and the cargo C interacts with the nuclear pore complex and pass through the channel into the nucleus
(compartment B).

• (Reaction 7, 4, 3) At the nucleus, RanGTP competes for binding with the receptor and cause the receptor to
dissociate from the cargo. The new complex formed by RanGTP and receptor then translocates to the cytoplasm
while the cargo is left inside the nucleus.

• (Reaction 2) Once at the cytoplasm, a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates RanGTP from
receptor. GTPase activating protein (GAP) then binds to RanGTP, causing the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP
and releasing energy.

• (Reaction 1, 6) The RanGDP produced in this process then binds the nuclear transport factor NTF2 which

returns it to the nucleus.

• (Reaction 5) Now in the nucleus, RanGDP interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which

replaces GDP with GTP, resulting again a RanGTP from, and beginning a new cycle.

The whole process can be formulated by a set of kinetics equations involving both cargo protein translocation and

Ran regulation. The molecular species in the kinetics equations are labelled according to Figure 4.

The ﬁrst term (i.e. k+
β /k−β ) is related to the free energy diﬀerence between binding and un-binding of NTF2+RanGTP complex which
k+
is much larger than 1: ∆F >> 1. This can also be understood using Eq.(B6) by noting that in the nucleus NTF2
seldom binds to RanGTP. Finally, since the free GTP to GDP ration, [f T ]/[f D], is buﬀered by cellular metabolism,
we simply treat the last term as a free parameter θ. Note that there are far more free GTP than Ran on a molar
basis and most of the Ran are in RanGTP form. After rescaling time by τ ← tc0kdiﬀ, with kdiﬀ = 10 sec−1 nM−1 and
c0 represent the diﬀusion-limited reaction rate and the characteristic molar concentration (set to 1nM), respectively,
and approximating e∆F ≈ 10 ∼ 100 , one can estimate (k+
5 /k−5 ) ∼ (10 ∼ 100) × θ, where θ := [f T ]/[f D] is treated as
a free parameter.

Appendix C: Standard estimate of diﬀusion-limited reaction rate

Considering two type of molecules A and B diﬀusing in a viscous environment. According the Fick’s law the

diﬀusion ﬂux of one type of molecule assuming the other is at stationary is given as

(cid:126)Jµ = −Dµ∇[µ],

(C1)

where µ = A, B and Dµ is the diﬀusion constant of molecule µ. Assuming spherical symmetry one can integrate
Fick’s law to get the total number of molecules diﬀusing through a given surface area:

where R is the sum of molecular radii of A and B. The factor ka := 4πR(DA + DB) is exactly the reaction rate of
the overall catalytic reaction under the assumption that the process is diﬀusion-limited (i.e. upon A and B are in
contact, the intermediate complex AB immediately reacts to form the ﬁnal product P):

φtot = 4πR(DA + DB)[A][B],

(C2)

Finally, recall Stokes-Einstein relation: D = kBT /(6πηa) with molecule (spherical) particle radius a, we have

ka = 4π(2a)

Using η = 10−1 (Pa·sec)= 10−3 kg/m/sec, we get

kdiﬀ := ka ∼ 10 × 109 [M−1 · sec−1] = 10 [nM−1 · sec−1]

Appendix D: Entropy Production of the Ran battery

The distinct feature of systems out of thermodynamics equilibrium is the continuous production of entropy. The
rate of entropy change (in time) consists of two parts: (i) the internal entropy change and (ii) the exchange of entropy
with the environment

= Π − Φ,

dS
dt

(D1)

where S is the entropy of the system and Π is the rate of entropy production and Φ denotes the rate of entropy ﬂow
from the system to the outside. Within this context, the 2nd law of thermodynamics dictates Π ≥ 0 and the notion
of steady states translates into Π = Φ: entropy produced is continuously given away to the environment. One can
further distinguishes the equilibrium from the nonequilibrium steady states by

• Equilibrium steady states (ESS): Π = Φ = 0
• Nonequilibrium steady states (NESS, i.e. irreversible): Π = Φ > 0
Consider systems that can be described by a continuous time Markov process such that the probability ﬂow can be

written as a master equation:

d
dt

Pi(t) =

(cid:88)

j

[Pj(t)Wji − Pi(t)Wij],

(D2)

where Wij is the transition rate from state j to state i and Pi(t) is the probability of state i at time t. An appropriate
microscopic description for the nonequilibrium system amounts to (i) having well-deﬁned entropy for the irreversible
systems and (ii) the entropy production rate Π should respects the non-negativity and should vanish when system
equilibrates (i.e. when it exhibits reversibility). For systems described by the master equation, thermodynamics
equilibrium is essentially the detailed-balanced condition: PiWij = PjWji. The solution for the ﬁrst is the Boltzmann-
Gibbs entropy:

Pi(t) ln Pi(t),

(D3)

S(t) = −kB

(cid:88)

i

while the entropy production rate is advanced by the Schnakenberg description[29]:

Π(t) =

kB
2

In the stationary state, Eq.(D4) reduces to

(cid:88)

(D4)

(D5)

where Pi is the stationary probability distribution. It’s easy to check that Π − Π(t) = dS/dt → 0 in the stationary
state.

In the context of Ran futile cycle, one can map the circuit in FIG. 4B to a nonequilibrium Markov process. A
non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) essentially necessitates breaking the detailed balance in the underlying Markov
process and therefore, the system(i.e. Ran futile cycle) has a nonzero entropy production that is continuously given
away to the environment. Such entropy production is exactly the power consumed by the circuit to maintain NESS.

FIG. 7: Locations of entropy production extremums and maximum nuclear localization This clearly shows that the
importin level at which EPmin occurs is almost in line with that for NLmax. Thus, one strategy for maximizing the eﬃciency
of demixing is to have the futile cycle operate in regime where it can minimize its entropy production. The parameters used
are as in FIG.3.

FIG. 8: Entropy production is encoded in reaction 4 in the futile cycle The forward ﬂux of reaction 4 in FIG.4 and EP
in FIG.3B depends on the importin level in a similar way. Thus, EP is essentially encoded in the reaction for RanGTP-importin
complex formation.
