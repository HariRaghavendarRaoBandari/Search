We report a comparative polarized Raman study of Weyl semimetals TaAs, NbAs, TaP and
NbP. The evolution of the phonon frequencies with the sample composition allows us to determine
experimentally which atoms are mainly involved for each vibration mode. Our results conﬁrm
previous ﬁrst-principles calculations indicating that the A1, B1(2), E(2) and E(3) modes involve
mainly the As(P) atoms, the B1(1) mode is mainly related to Ta(Nb) atoms, and the E(1) mode
involves both kinds of atoms. By comparing the energy of the diﬀerent modes, we establish that
the B1(1), B1(2), E(2) and E(3) become harder with chemical pressure increasing. This behavior
diﬀers from our observation on the A1 mode, which decreases in energy, in contrast to its behavior
under external pressure.

The prediction [1–3] and recent experimental discov-
ery [4–7] of Weyl fermions in condensed matter systems,
in particular in the so-called Weyl semimetals of the AX
(A = Ta, Nb; X = As, P) family [8, 9], are now widely
acknowledged as major scientiﬁc breakthroughs. The
simple AX binary compounds open new possibilities for
practical applications. Unlike the topological insulators,
for which the relevant electronic properties occur at the
surface, the Weyl nodes in the Weyl semimetals are a
property of the bulk electronic structure. In addition to
the charge sign and the spin of the electronic carriers,
the Weyl semimetals introduce chirality as an appealing
parameter for applications, and the chiral anomaly in
the Weyl semimetals leads to a large negative magneto-
resistance [10–13]. However, the properties associated
with the Weyl nodes vary signiﬁcantly across the AX
series [14–16].
In order to understand how tuning the
electronic properties of the Weyl semimetals for mak-
ing devices based on powder, single-crystals or ﬁlms of
these compounds, it is necessary to characterize the crys-
tal structure and the lattice dynamics of real samples.

Here we report a comparative Raman study of AX
(A = Ta, Nb; X = As, P). For each of these materials
we observe all the optical modes at the Brillouin zone
center, which consist in one A1 mode, two B1 modes
and three E modes. At the ﬁrst order, we show that
the phonon mode energies vary with the inverse of the
square-root of the mass of the atoms mainly involved in
the vibrations, which allows us to conﬁrm experimentally
the mode assignments in previous ﬁrst-principles calcu-
lations on TaAs [17]. Our comparative study allows us
to show that most modes become harder with chemical
pressure increasing.
In contrast, the energy of the A1
mode becomes smaller with chemical pressure increasing,
which diﬀers from its behavior under external pressure

[18], thus indicating that chemical pressure and external
pressure act diﬀerently on the system.

The single crystals of TaAs, NbAs, TaP and NbP used
in this study were grown by chemical vapor transport
and characterized by X-ray diﬀraction to determine the
crystal orientation [10]. Freshly prepared platelike sam-
ples with typical size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.08 mm3 were pre-
pared for Raman scattering measurements at room tem-
perature. The measurements were performed with the
514.5 nm and 488.0 nm excitations of an Ar-Kr laser
focussed on ﬂat sample surface regions with a 100× ob-
jective mounted in a back-scattering micro-Raman con-
ﬁguration. The power at the sample was smaller than
0.4 mW. The signal was analyzed by a Horiba Jobin
Yvon T64000 spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-
cooled CCD camera.

this system decompose [19] into [A1+E]+[A1+2B1+3E],
where the ﬁrst and second terms correspond to the acous-
tic and optic phonon modes, respectively. All the optic

of panels (g) and (h), with the corresponding color. Each mode is associated with a symbol that helps identifying the peaks in

scattered (ˆes) light beams are parallel to the surface of
the sample. The sample misalignment for our NbP sam-
ple leads to the observation of all the Raman phonons
(6). As expected, peaks with the same symmetries can
be observed in all materials. Hence, we observe one peak
with a nearly constant intensity with respect to the in-
plane angle in the ˆei||ˆes conﬁguration but with nearly
zero intensity at 0 degree (and at every 90 degree steps)
in the ˆei ⊥ ˆes conﬁguration. These peaks necessarily
have the A1 symmetry. Similarly, for each material there
are two peaks showing zeros of intensity at 45 degrees
(and at every 90 degree steps) with ˆei||ˆes, but with zeros
of intensity at 0 degree (and at every 90 degree steps)
for ˆei ⊥ ˆes. These peaks correspond to B1 phonons.
Finally, the three extra peaks in our measurements of
NbP [Figs. 1(g) and 1(g)] exhibit the same angular de-
pendence, conﬁrming that they can be described by the
same irreducible representation of point group C4v, in
this case E.

when comparing the same vibration mode for diﬀerent
AX (A = Ta, Nb; X = As, P) compounds, the mode fre-
quency will vary signiﬁcantly only when the main atoms
involved in the vibration are changed. For example, the
A1 mode in TaAs increases by only about 16 cm−1 in
NbAs, whereas larger shifts of more than 120 cm−1 are
found for TaP and NbP, which have approximately the
same A1 mode energy (see Table I). In agreement with
previous ﬁrst-principles calculations, we conclude experi-
mentally from this observation that the A1 mode involves
mainly As or P atoms, for which the atomic masses are
74.9 u. a. and 31.0 u. a., respectively. Indeed, the ra-
tio of the square of the average of the A1 mode energy
in TaP and NbP, over the square of the average of the
A1 mode energy in TaAs and NbAs (squared frequency
average ratio), gives 2.1, which is similar to the 2.4 ra-
tio of the As and P atomic masses.
In the same way,
there is only about 10 cm−1 diﬀerence between the en-
ergy of the B1(2) mode in TaAs and NbAs, but there
is an increase of more than 130 cm−1 in the mode en-

ergy in TaP and NbP as compared to TaAs, indicating
that the B1(2) phonon mode also involves mainly As or
P vibrations. Here again we checked that the squared
frequency average ratio is 2.5, very close to 2.4. In con-
trast, the similarities in the B1(1) mode energies in TaAs
(171.7 cm−1) and TaP (189.2 cm−1) on one hand, and in
NbAs (231.7 cm−1) and NbP (259.2 cm−1) on the other
hand, indicate that the B1(1) phonon involves mainly
vibrations of Ta and Nb, which have atomic masses of
180.9 u. a. and 92.9 u. a., respectively. In this case the
squared frequency average ratio (NbAs-NbP over TaAs-
TaP) is 1.9, which is equivalent to the ratio of the atomic
masses of Ta and Nb.

We now turn our attention to spectra recorded with
the ZZ and ZX polarization conﬁgurations, which are dis-
played in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. For perfect
alignement and in the absence of defects, the E modes
should be probed by the ZX conﬁguration, for which
ˆei ⊥ ˆes. As reported before [17], 4 peaks are observed
in the ZX spectrum of TaAs, among which one can be
assigned to the A1 phonon while the others correspond
to the three E modes. The spectrum in the ZZ conﬁgu-
ration helps conﬁrming the assignment of the A1 phonon
in the ZX spectrum. The situation is similar in NbAs,
TaP and NbP. However, one additional peak is observed
at 137.0 cm−1 in TaP, very close to the E(1) mode, and
at 253.7 cm−1 in NbAs, as a shoulder of the E(2) mode.
Although the origin of these extra peaks remains unclear,
it is worth mentioning the possibility of local modes due
to non-stoichiometric defects. Indeed, a recent transmis-
sion electron microscope study reveals the existence of
such defects in the AX (A = Ta, Nb; X = As, P) series
[20].

As with the A1 and B1 modes, we can show that the en-
ergies of the E(2) and E(3) modes vary approximately like
the inverse square-root of the mass. While the E(2) mode
energy is almost the same in TaAs and NbAs, the energy
of the E(2) mode in TaP is only 4.6 cm−1 larger than
in NbP. We thus conclude that the E(2) mode involves
mainly vibrations of As(P), with a squared frequency av-
erage ratio of 2.1 comparable to the ratio of the As and
P masses. Similarly, we ﬁnd that the E(3) mode also
involves mainly vibrations of As(P), also with a squared
frequency average ratio of 2.1. In contrast, it is impos-
sible to ﬁnd pairs of compounds for the E(1) phonon.

This is easy to understand if we assume, in agreement
with ﬁrst-principles calculations [17], that both Ta(Nb)
and As(P) have signiﬁcant displacement amplitudes in
the E(3) mode.

By comparing the phonon energies across the whole
AX (A = Ta, Nb; X = As, P) series, we can also com-
ment on the eﬀect of chemical pressure. The c axis pa-
rameter, the a axis parameter and the volume of the unit
cell follow the sequence [20]: TaP<NbP<TaAs<NbAs.
Since the A1 mode, which involves mainly As or P, has a
larger energy in NbAs than in TaAs, and a larger energy
in NbP than in TaP, we conclude that chemical pressure
decreases the energy of the A1 mode. Surprisingly, this
behavior is opposite to the one reported on TaAs under
external pressure [18]. In contrast to the A1 mode, the B1
modes become harder under chemical pressure. This is
also the case for the E(3) mode. While the E(2) mode is
basically the same in TaAs and NbAs, it also exhibits an
increase under chemical pressure in TaP as compared to
NbP. As for the E(1) mode, the notion of chemical pres-
sure applied to the phonons is irrelevant since both kinds
of atoms are involved. Although the behavior of the B1
and E modes under external pressure is unknown, our
result on the A1 mode indicates that external pressure
and chemical pressure cannot be regarded as equivalent.
In summary, we performed a polarized Raman study of
Weyl semimetals TaAs, NbAs, TaP and NbP. We iden-

tiﬁed all the optic phonon modes of these compounds.
By comparing the evolution of the diﬀerent modes across
that series, we determined experimentally which atoms
are involved in each mode. While the A1, B1(2), E(2)
and E(3) modes involve mainly vibrations of As or P, the
B1(1) correspond mainly to vibrations of Ta or Nb. Both
kind of atoms are involved in the E(1) mode. Disregard-
ing the E(1) mode, for which the eﬀect of external pres-
sure on phonons cannot be determined, we also showed

that all the other phonons except the A1 mode become
harder with external pressure. Interestingly, the behav-
ior of the A1 mode under chemical pressure is opposite
to the one reported under external pressure, indicating
that both kind of pressure eﬀect the system diﬀerently.
