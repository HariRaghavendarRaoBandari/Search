ABSTRACT

Context. The protoplanetary disk of the F-type star HD 135344B (SAO 206462) is in a transition stage and shows many intriguing
structures both in scattered light and thermal millimeter emission which are possibly related to planet formation processes and planet-
disk interactions.
Aims. We will study the morphology and surface brightness of the disk to gain insight in the dynamical processes of the innermost disk
regions, the formation of protoplanets, planet-disk interactions traced in the surface and midplane layers and the dust grain properties
of the disk surface.
Methods. We have carried out high-contrast polarimetric diﬀerential imaging (PDI) observations with VLT/SPHERE and obtained
the ﬁrst optical polarized scattered light images with the sub-instrument ZIMPOL in R- and I-band. Additionally, near-infrared
polarimetric observations were done with IRDIS in Y- and J-band. We will use the scattered light images, surface brightness proﬁles
and color to study in detail disk structures and brightness variations.
Results. The scattered light images reveal with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution the spiral arm structure of the disk
as well as the inner disk cavity of 25 au in all ﬁlters. Multiple shadow features are discovered on the outer disk and the observations
of the two epochs show indications of variability of one shadow. A positive surface brightness gradient is observed in the r2-scaled
images in south-west direction due to an azimuthally asymmetric perturbation of the temperature and/or surface density by the passing
spiral arms. The scattering eﬃciency in polarized light shows a positive linear trend towards longer wavelengths presumably because
of large/aggregate dust grains (2πa (cid:38) λ) in the disk surface.
Conclusions. The shadows on the outer disk of HD 135344B could be cast by an inner dust belt which is 22◦ inclined with respect
to the outer disk, a warped disk region which connects the inner disk with the cavity and an accretion funnel ﬂow from the inner disk
onto the star. The wide open spiral arms indicate the presence of one or multiple massive protoplanets, a local disk instability beyond
the dust cavity or a combination of the two.

1. Introduction

Protoplanetary disks around young stars are the birth environ-
ments of planets and studying them is essential for understanding
the planet formation process. High-resolution imaging in scat-
tered light and thermal millimeter emission reveals morphologi-
cal structures in protoplanetary disks and gives insight in planet-
disk interactions. Transition disks with large dust cavities are of
particular interest because they cover a small sample of proto-
planetary disks that are thought to be in the last stage of disk evo-
lution and planet formation. The disk evolves during this stage
from gas-rich protoplanetary disk to gas-poor debris disk. The
spectral energy distribution (SED) of transition disks is charac-
terized by a dip in the infrared excess caused by the cavity in the

inner regions of the disk (e.g. Strom et al. 1989; Skrutskie et al.
1990; Espaillat et al. 2014). Imaging of transition disks unam-
biguous establishes if a dust cavity is indeed the origin of the dip
in the infrared excess and can reveal other structures in the disk.
(Sub-)millimeter imaging traces the thermal radiation of large
dust grains in the midplane of a disk. On the other hand, the disk
is optically thick at optical and near-infrared wavelengths such
that scattered light observations trace smaller dust grains in the
surface layers.

HD 135344B (SAO 206462) is an F4Ve (Dunkin et al. 1997)
star that is surrounded by a transition disk which is located in
the Sco OB2-3 (Upper Centaurus Lupus) star forming region at
a distance of 140 ± 42 pc (van Boekel et al. 2005). It is the sec-
ondary stellar component of the visual binary system HD 135344
(SAO 206463) with a separation of 21(cid:48)(cid:48) (Mason et al. 2001).
HD 135344B has been classiﬁed as a group Ib source by Meeus
et al. (2001) for the reason that the spectral energy distribution
(SED) rises in the mid-infrared due to a cool dust component

yet lacks a 10 µm silicate emission feature. Group I sources are
expected to feature a large gap and exhibit mid-IR excess due
to reprocessing of stellar ﬂux by the rim and ﬂared surface of
the outer disk (Maaskant et al. 2013). The infrared excess of the
HD 135344B disk is LIR/L∗ = 0.53 (Dominik et al. 2003). The
main parameters of the system are summarized in table 1.
Analysis of the SED by Brown et al. (2007) suggested that a
large inner cavity with a radius of (cid:39) 45 au is present in the disk.
Dust continuum (sub-)millimeter observations have conﬁrmed
the presence of a dust cavity and a crescent-shaped asymmetry
with a factor of ∼ 2 emission contrast which indicates that large
dust grains are slightly concentrated on one side of the disk or
that the temperature proﬁle is non-axisymmetric (Brown et al.
2009; Lyo et al. 2011; Andrews et al. 2011; Pérez et al. 2014;
Pinilla et al. 2015). ALMA observations of 13CO and C18O re-
vealed a 25 au cavity where the surface density decreases by a
factor of 10000 with respect to the outer disk (van der Marel
et al. 2016). Pérez et al. (2014) measured a ∼ 62◦ position angle
(PA) of the major axis from the 12CO observations with an an-
gular resolution of 265 mas. The total dust mass (amax (cid:46) 1 mm)
of the disk is approximately 10−4 M(cid:12), consistently estimated by
several authors whereas there is no consensus on the total gas
mass of the disk (e.g. Lyo et al. 2011; Carmona et al. 2014; van
der Marel et al. 2016). A gas-to-dust ratio of 4 was derived by
Carmona et al. (2014) which would indicate that a signiﬁcant
fraction of the gas content is depleted. On the other hand, van
der Marel et al. (2016) obtain a gas-to-dust ratio of 80 from re-
cent ALMA observations.

The HD 135344B disk was ﬁrst observed in scattered light
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which showed part of
the outer disk but there was no unambiguously detection of any
substructures in the disk (Grady et al. 2009). Subaru/HiCIAO
H-band PDI observations by Muto et al. (2012) revealed two
spiral arms which were discussed in the context of spiral density
waves. Garuﬁ et al. (2013) carried out VLT/NACO PDI obser-
vations in H- and Ks-band which resolved a cavity with radius
of ∼ 28 au that was interpreted as a region that is carved out by
a forming protoplanet. More recently, angular diﬀerential imag-
ing (ADI) observations with the integral ﬁeld spectrograph (IFS)
of GEMINI/GPI were presented by Wahhaj et al. (2015) which
recovered the spiral arms and new streamer-like features.

Near-infrared-excess in the SED of HD 135344B is an indi-
cator of the presence of dust at small orbital radii (Brown et al.
2007; Carmona et al. 2014). A dust belt at sub-au distance from
the star was conﬁrmed by mid- and near-infrared interferomet-
ric observations with possibly a misalignment of the inner and
outer disk Fedele et al. (2008); Carmona et al. (2014); Menu
et al. (2015). HD 135344B is rotating near break-up velocity and
shows a 5.8 day periodicity in the equivalent width of its Hα
emission (Müller et al. 2011). The accretion rate of the star is
10−8 M(cid:12) yr−1 as estimated by Sitko et al. (2012) from Brγ and
Paβ lines. Therefore, a considerable amount of material is ﬂow-
ing inward from the outer disk through the cavity onto the star.
Multi-epoch spectroscopic and near-infrared photometric obser-
vations show variability over the course of months which could
be the result of thermal instabilities, magnetorotational instabil-
ities or planetary perturbations of the inner disk (Sitko et al.
2012).

Several mechanisms can be responsible for clearing out the
inner disk region of a transition disk. These include planet-disk
interaction (e.g. Rice et al. 2003; Pinilla et al. 2012), photoe-
vaporation by the UV-ﬁeld of the star (Alexander & Armitage
2007), dust growth (Dullemond & Dominik 2005) and accretion
driven by magnetorotational instabilities (Chiang & Murray-

Clay 2007, see however Dominik & Dullemond (2011)). In case
of HD 135344B, the planet-disk interaction scenario seems the
most likely origin of the dust cavity for three reasons. Firstly,
near-infrared excess of the SED and near- and mid-infrared in-
terferometric observations indicate that there is a warm dust
belt located at (sub-)au distance from the star which rules out
any inside-out clearing mechanism (Brown et al. 2007; Fedele
et al. 2008; Carmona et al. 2014; Menu et al. 2015). Secondly,
in the cavity both small and large dust grains are depleted and
dust growth alone can not explain the low surface density of
these two dust populations unless most of the grains are cen-
timeter in size or larger. Thirdly, the scattered light cavity is sig-
niﬁcantly smaller in radius than the observed cavity at (sub)-
millimeter wavelengths (Garuﬁ et al. 2013). The spatial segre-
gation of micron-sized and mm-sized dust grains, i.e. small and
large dust, is a natural outcome of particle trapping by a planet-
disk interaction (e.g. Rice et al. 2006; Pinilla et al. 2012; de Juan
Ovelar et al. 2013). When a protoplanet forms, it carves a gap
in the gas and dust because of the gravitational torque it exerts
on the disk. This results in a locally positive pressure gradient
at the outer edge of the gap which can trap large dust grains at
the pressure maximum but allows the small dust grains to ﬁlter
through with the gas down to smaller radii.

The cavity and spiral arms in the disk of HD 135344B are
fascinating and yet their origin is poorly understood. We aim
to study the morphology and surface brightness of the disk in
great detail to gain better insight in previously observed struc-
tures. This requires high-resolution, high-contrast imaging with

the best sensitivity possible. Therefore, we use polarimetric dif-
ferential imaging (PDI) which is a powerful technique to sup-
press the stellar light ﬂux which is multiple orders of magni-
tude larger than the scattered light from the disk surface. PDI
has been used to image various protoplanetary and debris disks,
with instruments such as VLT/NACO and SUBARU/HiCIAO
(e.g. Quanz et al. 2011; Grady et al. 2013; Avenhaus et al.
2014a). VLT/SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Ex-
oplanet REsearch; Beuzit et al. 2008) and GEMINI/GPI (Gemini
Planet Imager; Macintosh et al. 2008) are part of a new genera-
tion of extreme adaptive optics, high-resolution imaging instru-
ments that have recently become available which allow for direct
imaging of scattered light from protoplanetary and debris disks
(e.g. Benisty et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015; Wagner et al.
2015; Perrin et al. 2015; Rapson et al. 2015).
The principle behind PDI observations is that the stellar inte-
grated light is unpolarized down to a 10−6 fractional polarization
level (Kemp et al. 1987) whereas scattered light from protoplan-
etary dust grains will be polarized (Apai et al. 2004). The single
scattering polarization is determined by the scattering angle and
the dust grain properties such as composition, size, shape and
internal structure. Measurements of the linear Stokes parameters
are inherently diﬀerential and the diﬀerence of two orthogonal
polarization states subtracts the unpolarized light. Consequently,
the smeared point spread function (PSF) of the central star is re-
moved together with the unpolarized scattered light. PDI allows
for very eﬃcient speckle suppression inside the control radius
of the adaptive optics (AO) system if the orthogonal polarization
states are measured simultaneously. In this way, the large bright-
ness contrast of direct and scattered stellar light can be overcome
and the planet forming disk regions down to ∼ 10 au can be re-
solved in a nearby star forming region at a typical distance of
∼ 100 pc.

In this paper, we present R-, I-, Y- and J-band VLT/SPHERE
PDI observations of HD 135344B that provide us with a wealth
of information about the disk morphology and surface bright-
ness. This is the ﬁrst direct imaging observation of polarized
scattered light from the HD 135344B disk at optical wave-
lengths. The dust cavity and spiral arms are detected with un-
precedented sensitivity and angular resolution and several new
disk features have been revealed. We study the disk morphology,
surface brightness and color in the context of planet formation
processes, inner disk dynamics, dust properties and planet-disk
interactions that are traced in the surface and midplane layers.

The paper is structured as follows. The observations and data
reduction are described in section 2. The results are presented in
section 3. We discuss the results in the context of the innermost
disk region, the formation of spiral arms and (sub-)millimeter
observations in section 5. The conclusions are presented in sec-
tion 6.

2. Observations and data reduction
The observations were carried out during the nights of 30 March
2015 (IRDIS Y-band), 31 March 2015 (ZIMPOL R- and I-
band) and 02 May 2015 (J-band) with the VLT/SPHERE instru-
ment which is mounted on the UT3 Nasmyth A platform of the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, Chile. ZIMPOL
(Zurich IMaging POLarimeter; Thalmann et al. 2008; Schmid
et al. 2012) and IRDIS (Infra-Red Dual-beam Imager and Spec-
trograph; Dohlen et al. 2008; Langlois et al. 2014) are the optical
and near-infrared imaging component of SPHERE, respectively.
SPHERE contains an extreme adaptive optics system that was

used for the observations (SAXO; Fusco et al. 2006; Petit et al.
2014).

2.1. SPHERE/ZIMPOL
HD 135344B was observed simultaneously in R-band (λc =
0.63 µm) and I-band (λc = 0.79 µm) with the SlowPol polarimet-
ric imaging mode of ZIMPOL. The instrument applies a polar-
ization modulation to the incoming light and uses a beamsplitter
to separate two orthogonal intensity modulated beams which are
registered each on an individual demodulating detector which
have a ﬁeld of view of 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 × 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. The ZIMPOL detectors have
an eﬀective pixel scale of 3.5837±0.0006 by 3.6045±0.0005 mas
for camera 1 (I-band) and 3.5873 ± 0.0005 by 3.6081 ± 0.0006
mas for camera 2 (R-band) (Ginski et al., in prep.). The diﬀer-
ence in pixel scale for the horizontal and vertical direction is a
result of geometric distortions of the instrument. More speciﬁ-
cally, the toric mirrors in the common path infrastructure (CPI)
(Hugot et al. 2012) introduce an anamorphism between the hor-
izontal and vertical detector direction.

The ZIMPOL observations were carried out with a DIT of
10 s to reach a good S/N for the scattered light of the disk and
not strongly saturate the detector. No coronagraph was used in
order to be sensitive to the innermost disk regions. We estimate
a radius of conﬁdence for our observations of approximately 30
mas. Inside this radius, the data is not usable due to saturation
eﬀects. The central octopole pattern that is visible between 30
and 100 mas in both the Qφ and Uφ images (see ﬁgure 1) is likely
a result of instrumental eﬀects and/or the low-wind eﬀect. This
pattern reduces the SNR ratio very close to the star. Unsaturated
frames were obtained for each half-wave plate (HWP) position
with an additional ∼ 10−1 transmissivity neutral density ﬁlter.
This allows us to estimate the angular resolution of the images
and do a photometric calibration (see appendix A). The seeing
conditions were good with an average value of ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7.

The total integration time per HWP position was 960 s and
the total on-source integration time was 64 min (see table 2).
An additional 40 s integration per HWP position was carried out
with a neutral density ﬁlter. The observations comprised three
dithering positions with steps of 71 mas to minimize the contri-
bution of bad pixels. Four HWP positions were cycled (0◦, 45◦,
22.5◦ and 67.5◦ for Stokes +Q, -Q, +U and -U, respectively)
whereby each HWP position was used successively for two inte-
grations. A total number of 26 complete polarimetric cycles were
carried out and a single polarimetric cycle and single dithering
position was used for the total intensity measurement.

The data products of ZIMPOL were split into their two cam-
eras and polarization states. Standard data reduction routines
were applied including ﬂat ﬁeld, bias frame and bad pixel correc-
tion. The stellar position was determined using an asymmetric
2D Gaussian ﬁt because of the non-square nature of the ZIM-
POL pixels. We have used a correction of −1.188◦ for the rota-
tional oﬀset of the HWP with respect to true north (see equation
2) which is determined from both cameras simultaneously. The
frames have been upscaled by a factor of 2 in vertical-direction
to make the pixels square, the frames are centered with the de-
rived stellar location and non-linear pixels have been mapped
out. Instrumental polarization is corrected by equalising the or-
dinary and extraordinary beam between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 (Avenhaus et al.
2014b). Qφ and Uφ frames (see section 2.3) were obtained for
each HWP cycle and combined with a mean-stacking. Astro-
metric calibration was performed on the ﬁnal Qφ and Uφ images
(Ginski et al., in prep.). A more exhaustive description of the
data reduction technique is provided in the appendix of Aven-

haus et al. (2014b). Note that the crosstalk between the com-
ponents of the Stokes vector is much smaller for VLT/SPHERE
observations than it is for VLT/NACO observations such that a
crosstalk correction is not required.

The angular resolution of the ZIMPOL observations is esti-
mated from a reduced, non-saturated frame. The PSF full width
half maximum (FWHM) is 33.5 mas and 28.5 mas for R- and
I-band, respectively, which are comparable due to the smaller
diﬀraction limit in R-band and the higher Strehl-ratio in I-band.

2.2. SPHERE/IRDIS

In addition to the ZIMPOL PDI observations, we carried out
IRDIS dual-polarization imaging (DPI) observations at two dif-
ferent epochs approximately one month apart. Note that PDI
and DPI are equivalent techniques but there is an instrumen-
tal diﬀerence between ZIMPOL and IRDIS (Thalmann et al.
2008; Langlois et al. 2014). We observed HD 135344B in Y-
band (λc = 1.04 µm) during a HWP experiment which resulted
in an on-source integration of 151 s per HWP position with a
DIT of 0.84 s. The pixel scale of the IRDIS DPI observations
is approximately 12.25 mas per pixel with a 11(cid:48)(cid:48) × 11(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld of
view. The HWP that controls the orientation of the polarization
was cycled through 0◦, 45◦, 22.5◦ and 67.5◦ to obtain the full
linear component of the Stokes vector. We completed 7 polari-
metric cycles with median seeing conditions of ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)9 (see table
2).

Much deeper observations of the HD 135344B disk were car-
ried out in J-band (λc = 1.25 µm) with the DPI mode of IRDIS.
A small apodized Lyot coronagraph is used with an inner work-
ing angle (IWA) of 80 mas. The total integration time per HWP
position is 1152 s with a DIT of 32 s corresponding to 12 com-
pleted polarimetric cycles and a total on-source integration time
of 76.8 min. A non-coronagraphic integration was done at the
start and the end of the observations with a 0.84 s DIT and an ad-
ditional neutral density ﬁlter with an approximate 10−1 transmis-
sivity (the attenuation depends on the photometric ﬁlter). Seeing
conditions were good (∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7) and the spiral arms were visible on

a single DIT. However, the stellar PSF was not perfectly centered
behind the coronagraph although the AO loop was closed.

The ordinary and extraordinary beam were extracted from
the raw frames of the IRDIS detector. Standard data reduction
routines were applied including ﬂat ﬁeld, bias frame and bad
pixel correction. The stellar positions of the coronagraphic J-
band observations were determined from the center frames that
were obtained at the start and the end of the observation using
a waﬄe pattern. A linear interpolation between the two center
frames is used to determine the stellar position in all frames.
For the non-coronagraphic Y-band observations, we have deter-
mined the stellar position by ﬁtting a 2D Moﬀat function to the
saturated PSF proﬁle. We have used a correction of 1.7◦ for the
rotational oﬀset of the HWP with respect to true north (see equa-
tion 2).

Similar to the ZIMPOL observations, the instrumental polar-
ization of our J-band observation is corrected by equalising the
ordinary and extraordinary beam. The instrumental polarization
of the Y-band observations is determined by integrating the ﬂux
in an annulus with an inner radius of 6 pixels and outer radius
of 9 pixels centered on the star for Stokes Q and U separately.
The corresponding total intensity frames are multiplied with the
integrated ﬂux value after which it is subtracted from the Stokes
Q or U image (Canovas et al. 2011). The Qφ and Uφ images are
obtained for each HWP position with a mean-stacking.

The radius of conﬁdence of the J-band observations is ap-
proximately 80 mas, equal to the IWA of the coronagraph. The
angular resolution of the IRDIS J-band images is 38.5 mas. No
unsaturated frames were obtained during our Y-band observa-
tions and a determination of the angular resolution from the sci-
ence data is not possible.

2.3. Azimuthal Stokes parameters
We transform the linear Stokes parameters, Q and U, into their
polar coordinate counterparts, Qφ and Uφ, which are deﬁned as
(Avenhaus et al. 2014b):
Qφ = +Q cos 2φ + U sin 2φ
Uφ = −Q sin 2φ + U cos 2φ,

where φ is the position angle of a location (x, y) in the disk image
with respect to the stellar position (x0, y0). The position angle
is measured positively in counterclockwise direction from the
positive y-axis and is given by

+ θ,

(2)

The total polarized intensity, PI = (cid:112)

where θ corrects for small instrumental oﬀsets such as an angu-
lar misalignment of the HWP. In this way, Qφ > 0 for single
scattered light from astronomical dust grains that introduce ver-
tical polarization at moderate scattering angles. This implies that
the polarization vectors point in azimuthal direction, in contrast
to Qφ < 0 which corresponds to polarization in radial direction.
Q2 + U2, is equivalent to
the Qφ ﬂux when multiple scattering can be neglected. In that
case, the Uφ image does not contain any disk scattered light and
can be used to estimate the noise level of the Qφ image. Multi-
ple scattering eﬀects become more important in highly inclined
disks for which a non-azimuthal polarization component has to
be considered (Canovas et al. 2015). In contrast to PI, Qφ does
not contain any bias from computing the squares of Q and U
components in the presence of noise (Schmid et al. 2006).

3. Results
3.1. Polarized light imagery
Figures 1 and 2 show the ZIMPOL and IRDIS polarized inten-
sity images, respectively, and the corresponding signal-to-noise
(S/N) maps of HD 135344B. The disk is clearly detected and a
great amount of structure is seen with high S/N and unprece-
dented spatial resolution in the Qφ images of all ﬁlters. The left
column shows the unscaled Qφ and Uφ polarized intensity im-
ages on a linear color stretch and with a ﬁeld of view of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)4×1.(cid:48)(cid:48)4.
The R-, I- and Y-band images have been convolved with a 2D
Gaussian kernel with a FWHM of λ/D to reduce shot noise.

The center columns of ﬁgures 1 and 2 show the r2-scaled Qφ
and Uφ images on a linear color stretch and with each pixel mul-
tiplied with the square of the deprojected distance to the stellar
position at the center of the image. If we assume that the disk
is geometrically ﬂat then this correction compensates for the
inverse-square law of the irradiation of the disk by the central
star and discerns the dust density distribution on the disk sur-
face. We assume a disk inclination of 11◦ and a position angle of
the major axis of 62◦ (see table 1).

The pixel values of a high S/N Qφ image will be positive in
the single scattering limit for typical protoplanetary dust and a
modest disk inclination. No negative valued pixels are identiﬁed
in the high S/N disk regions of the unscaled Qφ images. This is
not the case near the center, where PSF smearing and low-wind
eﬀects dominate, and in the outer disk regions were the scattered
light ﬂux becomes comparable to the noise level. The inner disk
is expected to be located at an angular separation of approxi-
mately 10 mas which is smaller than the radius of conﬁdence.
However, the signal pattern in the inner regions of the ZIMPOL
images is expected to contain some of the smeared scattered light
from the inner disk but at this point it is not clear how signiﬁcant
this is with respect to the instrumental signal.
A moderate inclined disk is expected to have a peak-to-peak
ﬂux in the Uφ with respect to the Qφ image of about ∼ 5% due
to multiple scattering of photons (Canovas et al. 2015). For a
nearly face-on detected disk, the Uφ signal will be lower since
forward scattering of large dust grains (2πa (cid:38) λ with a the grain

radius and λ the photon wavelength) reduces the amount of mul-
tiple scattered photons that is directed towards the observer. Al-
though the Uφ image of the high S/N J-band observation seems
not to contain a coherent signal pattern (see ﬁgure 2), a 10 times
harder color stretch shows that there is a non-zero signal resid-
ual (see ﬁgure 3). The hard stretch of the Qφ image in ﬁgure 3
shows a surface brightness asymmetry between the east and west
side of the outer disk which will be further discussed in section
5.3. Also, an increase in surface brightness is visible around the
location of the telescope spider.

We determine the ratio of the azimuthally integrated Uφ and
Qφ signal in 50 linearly spaced annuli around the star between
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05 and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 (see ﬁgure 3). The J-band observation is used for
this analysis because of the high S/N compared to the other pho-
tometric ﬁlters. Here we have used the absolute pixel values such
that the Uφ signal from a cylindrically symmetric disk will not
even out to zero. As expected, the ratio approaches unity both in
the cavity ((cid:46) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2) and the outer most disk region ((cid:38) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7) be-
cause the scattered light ﬂux is similar to the noise level. The
scattered light from the disk region in between is of high S/N
and the Uφ signal is approximately 1% of the Qφ signal. This
could be a detection of a non-azimuthal polarization signal as a
result of multiple scattering in the disk considering the radiative
transfer models by Canovas et al. (2015) which predict ∼ 1− 2%
for a face-on disk orientation.

The SN maps in ﬁgure 1 and 2 are estimated from the Uφ
images. We add the pixel values in linearly spaced annuli around
the location of the star and calculate the standard deviation of
the pixel value distribution within each annulus which yields an
estimate of the noise level in the Qφ image as function of radial
separation from the star. We take the absolute pixel values in the
Qφ image and divide these by the Uφ standard deviation of the
corresponding annulus location which gives us a S/N estimate.
The same radial standard deviation distribution is used for the
S/N map of the Uφ image for which we take again the absolute
pixel value such that the SN map will contain sole positive val-
ues.

3.2. Disk morphology and brightness gradient
The disk is clearly detected from approximately 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 in the
r2-scaled Qφ images of both ZIMPOL and IRDIS (see ﬁgures 1
and 2) and there is a tentative detection of the disk in the J-band
image from 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 to 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 (see ﬁgure 3). We identify a number of
structures in the r2-scaled Qφ images which are related to the
morphology and surface brightness of the disk. The most promi-
nent features are the two spiral arms, the cavity, multiple shadow
features and a positive brightness gradient in SW direction.

The spiral arms are referred to as S1 and S2 following Muto
et al. (2012) and Garuﬁ et al. (2013) (see ﬁgure 4) and can be
traced from the outer disk rim at ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 to ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 (∼28-64 au).
Spiral arm S1 separates from the outer disk rim at a position an-
gle of ∼ 80◦ and spiral S2 at a position angle of ∼ 260◦ and both
spirals span an azimuthal range of ∼ 240◦. The spiral arms are
azimuthally symmetric in their morphology and have a surface
brightness contrast of a factor of 2-3 with the background disk
in the r2-scaled images. There appears a spiral arm branch on
the east side of the disk, also detected by Garuﬁ et al. (2013),
which we label S3. The scattered light cavity, initially revealed
by Garuﬁ et al. (2013), is clearly visible and has an approximate
radius of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 ((cid:39) 25 au). The outer disk orientation and outer
disk rim will be studied in more detail in appendix B. Multiple
shadow features have been discovered with our SPHERE obser-
vations, in particular clearly visible in the r2-scaled J-band im-

linear color stretch with the maximum and minimum value of the color scale a factor 10 smaller compared to ﬁgure 2. The ratio of the azimuthally
integrated Uφ and Qφ polarized surface brightness (right) is of the order of a few percent which suggests that multiple scattering eﬀects are
non-negligible (Canovas et al. 2015). Absolute pixel values are used for the azimuthal integration and the error bars show 5 standard deviations as
derived from the Uφ image. The dashed lines show the 25 au scattered light cavity radius as determined from our SPHERE PDI observations, the 46
au millimeter cavity radius from Andrews et al. (2011) and the outer radius at which the spiral arms are visible in the SPHERE PDI observations.

age due to the large DIT and use of a coronagraph which resulted
in a very high S/N detection of the outer disk. We will elaborate
on this discovery in section 3.5.

The ZIMPOL and IRDIS observations reveal a similar mor-
phology of the disk yet several diﬀerences in surface brightness
are visible. All photometric ﬁlters show in the r2-scaled Qφ im-
age a positive surface brightness gradient in SW direction which
will be discussed in section 5.3. In particular the ZIMPOL im-
ages show a distinct bright wedge-shaped region (see ﬁgure 4).
The mean r2-scaled pixel value in the bright wedge between
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)15 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 is a factor of 3.7 larger than the mean value from
the same sized wedge in opposite direction. The S2 spiral arm is
relatively faint in the ZIMPOL images which could be a shad-
owing eﬀect of the outer disk rim which is more optically thick
at optical wavelengths than it is at near-infrared wavelengths.
Interestingly, the ZIMPOL images show a bright blob in the S2
spiral arm at a position angle of ∼100◦which does not seem to be
aﬀected by the shadowing which could be a result of a local in-
crease in scale height. We speculate that this could be related to
the presence of a protoplanet which releases heat into the disk as
a result accreting gas. The accretion luminosity of a protoplanet
is given by L = GMp ˙M/Rp, with G the gravitational constant, Rp
the planet radius, Mp the planet mass and ˙M the mass accretion
rate. This translates in a 3×10−5 L(cid:12) for a planet with a Jupiter ra-
dius and mass planet and a mass accretion rate of 5 × 10−7 MJup
yr−1 (Uribe et al. 2013). This could locally increase the pres-
sure scale height of the disk and possibly increase the scattered
light ﬂux. Or alternatively, a recent collision of planetesimals or
comets could result in an expanding dust cloud which can also
locally increases the disk height.

3.3. Disk color in polarized light

The fraction of stellar light that scatters from the disk surface to-
wards the observer depends on a number of disk properties such
as size, mass and aspect ratio. Also, dust grain properties includ-
ing the phase function, single scattering albedo and polarizability
aﬀect the amount of polarized scattered ﬂux. We determine the
scattering eﬃciency of the disk from the detector integrated po-
larized intensity in the Qφ image and the detector integrated total
intensity of an (unsaturated) total intensity image which includes

Article number, page 8 of 22

the stellar light. A count rate correction is made for a diﬀerence
in DIT of the Qφ polarized intensity frame and the total intensity
frame. Additionally, we correct the total intensity frame for the
transmissivity of the neutral density ﬁlter that was used. We have
neglected foreground extinction since it will aﬀect the stellar ﬂux
and scattered light ﬂux equally.
We obtain a polarized intensity to total intensity (including
the star) ratio of 3.6 × 10−3 for R-band, 5.3 × 10−3 for I-band
and 9.8× 10−3 for J-band. For this analysis we could not include
the Y-band observations since no unsaturated frames were ob-
tained during the HWP experiment. A comparison of the three
ﬂux ratios indicates that the scattering eﬃciency increases ap-
proximately linearly towards longer wavelengths. From this we
can conclude that the disk integrated polarized intensity is intrin-
sically red in color consistently in R-, I- and J-band which will
be further discussed in section 3.4. Since we have performed a
photometric calibration (see appendix A), we can also determine
the Qφ integrated color of diﬀerent ﬁlter combinations. The re-
sulting colors are [I]− [J] = 1.07 mag, [R]− [J] = 1.89 mag and
[R] − [I] = 0.81 mag.

There is one caveat is this analysis, which is related to the
near break-up velocity of HD 135344B at its equator (Müller
et al. 2011). The rapid rotation will result in gravity darkening of
the stellar surface because the stellar radius at the poles will be
smaller than the equatorial radius which can be of the order of
20% (Aufdenberg et al. 2006). The von Zeipel theorem relates
the eﬀective temperature to the local gravity for all colatitude, θ,
which is given by (von Zeipel 1924)

(cid:33)1/4

for a purely radiative stellar interior. Consequently, a radius in-
crease from pole to equator of 20% corresponds to ∼ 10% de-
crease in eﬀective temperature. Since HD 135344B is observed
almost pole-on (Müller et al. 2011), the star appears bluer to us
then it appears to the dust grains in the disk surface that receive
radiation from the gravitationally darkened part of the star. How-
ever, the eﬀect will not signiﬁcantly alter our result on the color
of the disk in polarized light.

Figure 4 shows a color composite image where we com-
bined ZIMPOL R-band (blue), ZIMPOL I-band (red) and an
equally weighted average of R- and I-band (green). We have

NENET. Stolker et al.: Shadows cast on the transition disk of HD 135344B

which is consistent with the disk integrated color that was ob-
tained in section 3.3.
For small dust grains, the scattering cross section will be sig-
niﬁcantly larger at shorter wavelengths due to the σscat ∼ λ−4
wavelength dependence in the Rayleigh regime. Clearly, this is
not what is observed from the HD 135344B disk which indicates
that larger dust grains dominate the scattering optical depth in
the disk surface. In that case, the scattering phase function will
be more strongly forward peaked at optical wavelengths than at
near-infrared wavelengths which can result in red appearance of
the disk in scattered light (Mulders et al. 2013a).

A more useful diagnostic for interpreting scattered light
emission from optically thick disks is the eﬀective albedo which
is the scattering albedo with the forward scattering peak of
the phase function excluded (Mulders et al. 2013a). A detailed
multi-wavelength study of the optical properties of compact dust
aggregates by Min et al. (2016) showed that the eﬀective albedo
of micron-sized aggregate dust grains increases from optical
to near-infrared wavelengths. Therefore, the red color of the
HD 135344B disk could be the result of dust aggregates residing
in the disk surface which settle less eﬃciently to the disk mid-
plane than compact grains. One should be aware that we study
polarized intensity and not total intensity, so we have to assume
that the degree of polarization is approximately constant at the
observed wavelengths.

The surface brightness proﬁles are similar in overall shape
and the disk is detected in polarized scattered light out to approx-
imately ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7. Two evident maxima are visible along each direc-
tion with the innermost maximum at ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 corresponding to the
outer disk rim, possibly intertwined with a spiral arm. The sec-
ond surface brightness maximum is located around ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 − 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4
and is due to a spiral arm. As pointed out in section 3.2, the S2
spiral arm is relatively faint in the ZIMPOL observations which
is likely a result of a stronger shadowing eﬀect by the outer disk
rim at optical wavelengths than at near-infrared wavelengths.
This explains the relatively large oﬀ-set between the ZIMPOL
and IRDIS surface brightness around ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 of the proﬁle along
the 62◦ position angle.
Interestingly, the proﬁles along the 62◦ and 152◦ position an-
gles show a third maximum around ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)55 which was also de-
tected by Garuﬁ et al. (2013). It is only visible in our J-band
surface brightness proﬁle since these observations were carried
out with a coronagraph and a larger DIT could be used which
resulted in a higher S/N signal from the outer parts of the disk.
This branch from the S2 spiral arm is also visible in the r2-scaled
ZIMPOL images (see ﬁgure 4). It could be a result of diﬀeren-
tial rotation and angular momentum exchange by viscous forces
when the spiral arm pattern velocity is diﬀerent from the local
sub-Keplerian gas velocity. Consequently, material in the spiral
arm can lose or gain angular momentum and drift inward or out-
ward with respect to the spiral arm.

We average the Qφ surface brightness proﬁle in azimuthal di-
rection and ﬁt the slope with a power law function. We chose two
radial regimes, 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4-0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7-0.(cid:48)(cid:48)9, and perform a weighted
least squares ﬁt of a linear function in log-log space. The weights
are given by the standard deviation of the Uφ image for which we
apply the same radial binning as the averaged Qφ proﬁle. The κ1
index (inner disk part) is mainly aﬀected by the disk perturbation
in the spiral arms whereas the κ2 index (outer disk part) probes
the geometry of the disk surface. The best-ﬁt results are pro-
vided in table 3 and the κ2 indices indicate that the surface height
at which the disk in radial direction reaches an optical depth of
unity has a ﬂat and not a ﬂaring shape (Whitney & Hartmann
1992).

POL I-band (red) and the average of R- and I-band (green). Throughout
this work we use a major axis position angle of 62◦ (Pérez et al. 2014).
From the preceding and receding CO lines (Pérez et al. 2014) and as-
suming that the observed spiral arms are trailing, we infer that the near
side is along the southern minor axis. We follow Muto et al. (2012) and
Garuﬁ et al. (2013) with the labelling of spiral arms S1 and S2 and the
spiral arm branch on the east side of the disk is labelled S3.

scaled the I-band image by a factor of 1.05 to correct for the
larger photometric ﬂux in I-band with respect to R-band (Coul-
son & Walther 1995). The disk appears indeed red in color as
expected. A striped pattern in azimuthal direction is present in
the ZIMPOL data which is likely an artifact of the rotation of
the telescope spiders during the observation.

3.4. Surface brightness proﬁles
We use the unscaled Qφ images to obtain radial surface bright-
ness proﬁles along the major and minor axis of the disk which
are shown in ﬁgure 5. A radial cut is made through the disk with
an azimuthal width of 10◦ and 100 linearly spaced bins in radial
direction between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05 and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. The error bars that are shown
are 1 standard deviation determined from the corresponding un-
scaled Uφ image of the same photometric ﬁlter. We deﬁned an-
nuli at the same radial distance and with the same radial width
as the Qφ surface brightness bins and determine the standard de-
viation of the surface brightness distribution of all pixels within
a particular annulus. The Y-band observation is excluded from
the surface brightness proﬁles because a photometric calibration
was not possible.

Figure 5 shows the relative surface brightness contrast of
the polarized scattered light magnitude and the stellar magnitude
(see table 1). This gives an indication of the scattering eﬃciency
of the disk as function of radial separation from the star for each
ﬁlter. Note that the IRDIS photometric calibration (see appendix
A) has a relatively large uncertainty and comparing the surface
brightness between diﬀerent wavelengths can only be done ap-
proximately. In general, the disk scattered light emission appears
to be red in color with local deviations from this overall trend

located in a speciﬁc bin. The major axis proﬁle is shown in the top ﬁgure and the minor axis proﬁle is shown in the bottom ﬁgure. The position
angle of the axis with respect to true north measured in eastward direction is shown in the top left and top right and the colors indicate diﬀerent
photometric ﬁlter. The error bars show 1 sigma uncertainties determined from the corresponding Uφ image by deﬁning an annulus at the same
radial distance and with the same radial width as the Qφ surface brightness bin. We have rejected bins in which the mean Qφ count rate is negative.
Note that the error bars do not include the uncertainty from the photometric calibration.

3.5. Shadow features and indications for variability

A striking discovery of our SPHERE PDI observations is the
presence of multiple shadows that are cast on the outer disk of
HD 135344B. They are visible over a large radial distance with
a modest azimuthal gradient and are identiﬁed by their relatively
low surface brightness. Given the near face-on orientation of the
disk and the narrowness and radial extent of the shadow lanes,
it seems unlikely that the local lowering in surface brightness
is related to a change in dust properties and corresponding (po-
larization) phase function and shadows are the most likely ex-
planation. The narrow shadow lanes have not been detected in
previous scattered light images but an azimuthally broad dip in
the surface brightness was identiﬁed by Muto et al. (2012) and
Garuﬁ et al. (2013) which is also visible in our PDI observations
with high ﬁdelity. In particular the r2-scaled Qφ J-band image
shows well deﬁned locations and shapes of the shadow features
as a result of the high S/N of the image. We show in ﬁgure 6 the

Article number, page 10 of 22

polar mapping of the r2-scaled Qφ images which is a projection
of the Cartesian image onto a polar coordinates grid.

In the r2-scaled J-band polar mapping of ﬁgure 6, we iden-
tify three shadow lanes (A, B and C) at position angles of ap-
proximately 25◦, 165◦ and 300◦, respectively, and additionally a
broader weak shadow (D) which is bound by shadow lanes A and
B. The decrease in surface brightness at the shadow locations is
quantiﬁed in the top right of ﬁgure 8 which shows the radially
integrated surface brightness of the unscaled Qφ J-band image.
This ﬁgure shows that the dim region D is bound by shadows A
and B but seems detached from A and B in terms of integrated
surface brightness. Note that given the almost face-on geometry
of this system (inclination is ∼ 11◦), no strong forward scatter-
ing eﬀect is expected in the surface brightness. Additionally, the
position angle of the major axis is 62◦ (Pérez et al. 2014) such
that the brightest side of the disk is located along the major axis

4. Analysis

4.1. Radiative transfer model

Our PDI observations are carried out during two diﬀerent
epochs which are approximately one month apart from each
other (see table 2). Here we refer to the R-, I- and Y band ob-
servations as epoch 1 and the J-band observations as epoch 2.
Interestingly, a comparison of the polar mappings of the two
epochs in ﬁgure 6 shows indications of variability of shadow fea-
ture C. The dashed lines in the polar mapping correspond with
the dashed line position angles from the radially collapsed Qφ
J-band image in ﬁgure 8. By following the dashed lines in ﬁg-
ure 6 upward from the J-band polar mapping, one can clearly
see that the position and shape of the shadow features are diﬀer-
ent between the two epochs. More speciﬁcally, shadow lane C in
the J-band polar mapping appears to be absent, or shifted to a
larger position angle, in the polar mappings of epoch 1. A pos-
sible explanation for shadow features A, B and D is an warped
inner disk. We will explore this scenario with a radiative transfer
model in section 4.1 and discuss this in section 5.1.

To test the inclined inner disk and disk warp hypothesis, we use
the 3D radiative transfer code MCMax3D to qualitatively repro-
duce shadow lanes A and B and shadow region D. MCMax3D
is an extension of the 2D radiative transfer code MCMax (Min
et al. 2009) which self-consistently calculates the thermal struc-
ture of the disk for a parametric surface density proﬁle of the gas
with an exponential tapering oﬀ and a rounded disk rim (Mulders
et al. 2013b)

where H(r)/r = (H0/r0)(r/r0)ψ is the parametric prescription of
the aspect ratio, H(r) is the pressure scale height, H0/r0 is the as-
pect ratio at reference radius r0 and ψ the ﬂaring index. We use
a power law dust size distribution with index apow with a min-
imum and maximum grain size of amin and amax, respectively.
Grain size dependent dust settling is calculated with a modiﬁed
version of the method by Dubrulle et al. (1995) which assumes
an equilibrium between gravitational settling and turbulent mix-
ing (Woitke et al. 2016). The main parameters for the disk setup
are speciﬁed in table 1 and we adopt the stellar temperature, lu-
minosity, mass and distance from table 4. For the surface density
tapering we use  = γ which corresponds to the self-similar so-
lution (Hartmann et al. 1998).

Our radiative transfer model consists of three diﬀerent zones
which are independent in their disk structure and dust properties.
We refer to those as zone 1, 2 and 3 which correspond to the inner
disk, disk warp and outer disk, respectively (see ﬁgure 7). Zone
2 and zone 3 are separated by a region with zero surface density
which approximates the observed scattered light cavity of our
observations. We neglect the spiral arms and shadow feature C
in our radiative transfer simulation and only aim to model qual-
itatively shadow features A, B and D. The location and shape
of shadow lanes A and B are mainly determined by the radial
extension, orientation, aspect ratio and dust mass of the inner
disk. In addition, the ﬂaring index of the outer disk is important
since a stronger ﬂaring will curve the shape of the shadow lanes
in contrast to a constant aspect ratio disk on which the shadow
boundaries point straight in radial direction and a geometrically
ﬂat disk on which shadows are always cast with an azimuthal
separation of π.

The warped disk region is approximated with a radially nar-
row disk component starting at the outer edge of the inner disk.
The (midplane) inclination of zone 2 is exactly between the ori-
entation of zone 1 and zone 3 and the scale height of zone 2 is
chosen such that it approximately connects the inner disk and
the cavity midplane. Furthermore, we use α = 10−1 for zone 2
to make sure that the dust grains are vertically mixed to approxi-
mate a warped disk region through which dust accretes from the
outer disk midplane towards the inclined inner disk. The dust
mass in zone 2 is chosen such that we obtain a surface brightness
dimming similar to shadow feature D in the J-band observation.
We need a total optical depth through the midplane of zone 2 of
2.6 to achieve this. The inner disk aspect ratio has to be relatively
small in order to produce the narrow shadow lanes A and B. The
relative inclination between the inner disk and outer disk is 22◦.
Although this is a very crude way of modelling a disk warp it
reproduces the morphology of the shadows well.

The results are shown in ﬁgure 8 which includes both the r2-
scaled Qφ image from our IRDIS J-band observations and the
synthetic MCMax3D r2-scaled Qφ image. The simulated Stokes
Q and U images have been convolved with the PSF from our
IRDIS observations before converting the Stokes parameters to
Qφ and Uφ. On the right side of ﬁgure 8, we show the radially
collapsed surface brightness of the unscaled Qφ images from 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1
to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 with 95 evenly spaced position angle bins. The error bars
show 1 standard deviation of the pixel values in the correspond-
ing position angle bin of the Uφ image. For the high S/N MC-
Max3D image, this corresponds to a real spread in the Uφ signal
as a result of multiple scattering eﬀects. For the observed J-band

is used to estimate the orbital radius of the shadow casting material (see
section 5.1).

4.2. Spiral arms as tracers of protoplanets

Spiral arms have been observed in scattered light images of sev-
eral protoplanetary disks, including HD 135344B (Muto et al.
2012; Garuﬁ et al. 2013; Wahhaj et al. 2015), MWC 758 (Grady
et al. 2013; Benisty et al. 2015), HD 100546 (Boccaletti et al.
2013; Avenhaus et al. 2014b), HD 142527 (Casassus et al. 2012;
Rameau et al. 2012; Canovas et al. 2013; Avenhaus et al. 2014a)
and HD 100453 (Wagner et al. 2015). They are caused by local

observer is arbitrary in its rotation around the vertical axis.

perturbations of the disk surface density or scale height but the
origin of spiral arm structures in protoplanetary disks is still un-
der debate. Interestingly, all these disks are in a transition stage
and contain a large dust cavity which could be related to the
observed spiral arms. However, there is an observational bias to-
wards direct imaging of gapped disks, although scattered light
detections of gapless disks do exists (Quanz et al. 2012; Kusak-
abe et al. 2012). Several mechanisms have been proposed which
include planet-disk interactions (Tanaka et al. 2002), gravita-
tional instabilities (Lodato & Rice 2004) and tidal interactions
with a binary companion (Boss 2006).

Low-mass protoplanets trigger density waves at the Lindblad
resonances of the disks they are embedded in (Ogilvie & Lubow
2002). Interference of diﬀerent azimuthal modes results in a one-
armed spiral which can be approximated with linear perturba-
tion theory for the case that Mp/M∗ << (H(r)/r)3, where Mp
is the mass of the protoplanet, M∗ is the stellar mass, H(r) is
the pressure scale height and r is the disk radius. Higher order
perturbation terms become important when Mp/M∗ ∼ (H(r)/r)3
which can lead to the presence of 2nd order spiral arm resonance
(Juhász et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015).

From the reference aspect ratio at the launching point of the den-

We use equation 6 to ﬁt simultaneously spiral arms S1 and S2
in the r2-scaled Qφ J-band image (e.g. Muto et al. 2012; Grady

to be Keplerian with ζ = 3/2 and we use the ﬂaring index, ψ =

theory approximation which requires two protoplanets to explain
the two spiral arms which will be discussed in section 5.2.

We ﬁtted the spiral wake to the radial surface brightness
maxima along the spirals S1 and S2 of the r2-scaled Qφ J-band
image, using 50 and 64 equidistant points in azimuth for S1 and
S2, respectively. The image is deprojected and we do a χ2 mini-
mization of the grid of parameters. We aim to ﬁnd two separate
solutions by restricting the radial position of the protoplanet to
be either inside (10 < r < 300 mas) or outside (300 < r < 1100
mas) the scattered light cavity. The azimuthal coordinate is ﬁtted
over the full 2π azimuth and the aspect ratio parameter is lim-
ited to 0.05 < hp < 0.4 such that it is consistent with radiative
transfer modeling (Andrews et al. 2011; Carmona et al. 2014)
and the temperatures required are still physical. The maximum

orbital radius of the protoplanets in the exterior of the disk is
set to 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 ≈ 154 au. Although arbitrary in its value, the surface
density beyond this radius is likely too low to form in situ pro-
toplanets. The parameter grid consists of 30, 70 and 70 linearly
spaced values for hS1, rS1/rS2 and φS1/φS2.

Table 3 gives an overview of the priors that are used and the
best-ﬁt parameters that have been obtained and ﬁgure 9 shows
the r2-scaled J-band image with an overlay of the best-ﬁt spi-
ral solutions. For the protoplanet solutions inside the cavity, we
are not able to ﬁt the innermost surface brightness maxima due
to the large pitch angles of the spiral arms. This would require a
disk aspect ratio beyond the upper limit which would correspond
to temperatures that are unphysical for a typical protoplanetary
disk, a similar result as for the spiral arms of MWC 758 (Benisty

the cavity, an accretion funnel ﬂow from the inner disk onto the
star, an (aperiodic) outﬂow from the rapidly rotating star or an
inclined circumplanetary disk of a planet orbiting in the vicinity
of the star. From the three observed shadow lanes, shadows A
and B (see ﬁgure 6) are most likely cast by the inner disk for two
reasons. Firstly, shadow C was not detected at the same position
angle in the ﬁrst epoch of observations and precession of the
inner disk is not expected to occur on a monthly timescale. Sec-
ondly, the misaligned inner disk should be connected with the
outer disk by a warped region through which material accretes
and the inner disk replenishes. The star is accreting at a consider-
able rate of 10−8 M(cid:12) yr−1 (Sitko et al. 2012) and a warped region
will cast a (broad) shadow which will approximately be bound
by the shadow lanes that are cast by the inner disk. Our hypoth-
esis is that the warped disk region is responsible for shadow D
which manifests itself as a subtle dimming of the surface bright-
ness. The surface density in the disk warp will be low compared
to the outer disk and a direct detection of scattered light from
this region is not expected given the sensitivity and S/N of our
SPHERE observations.

Shadow lane C was clearly detected in the J-band observa-
tion, but a comparison with the epoch 1 observations showed
that this shadow was not detected or present at a larger position
angle in the R-, I and Y-band observations. We speculate that
this shadow is cast by an accretion funnel ﬂow from the sub-
au inner disk towards the star. The stellar Hα emission exhibits
a variable equivalent width with a 5.8 days periodicity which
could be related to an accretion funnel ﬂow orbiting the star at
the truncation radius of the inner disk (Müller et al. 2011). In that
case, the location of shadow C will be variable on a timescale of
days and could even disappear depending on the orientation of
the accretion funnel ﬂow with respect to the disk and our line
of sight. This would be interesting because HD 135344B has a
weak magnetic ﬁeld (Hubrig et al. 2009) and the star is rotating
near break-up velocity (Müller et al. 2011) which means that no
mechanism such as magnetic braking has prevented the spin-up
by the continuous accretion infall.

A comparison of the location of the shadows of the two
epochs of our SPHERE PDI observations (see ﬁgure 6) shows a
hint of shadow variability. However, the R-, I- and Y-band obser-
vations are of signiﬁcantly lower S/N than the J-band observa-
tions which makes it diﬃcult to compare with high precision the
shadow locations in the polarized scattered light images. Also,
the wavelength dependent dust opacities might alter the shape
of the shadow features. To probe the dynamics of the innermost
disk region, it is possible to use variability of the casted shad-
ows. In particular, an alternation in shape and location of the
shadow features gives an indication of the geometry and vari-
ability timescale of the shadow casting object. For example due
to precession of a warped inner disk, an accretion funnel ﬂow or
a circumplanetary disk (Foucart & Lai 2011; Müller et al. 2011;
Sitko et al. 2012).

Shadows that are cast by material in the vicinity of the cen-
tral star will show an azimuthal gradient when the Keplerian
timescale of this material is similar to or smaller than the time
delay related to the ﬁnite speed of light with which the shadow
traverses the disk. We estimate the disk radius of the material
that casts shadow lane C, which might originate from an ac-
cretion funnel ﬂow. The visible radial extension of this shadow
is approximately 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)35 which corresponds to an 6.8 hr time of
ﬂight. Over this distance, the shadow shows an azimuthal gra-
dient of ∼ 25◦ (see ﬁgure 6) which corresponds to the orbital
rotation while the shadow was traversing the disk with the speed
of light. Translating this into an orbital frequency gives us a ra-

aspect ratio of the protoplanets in the exterior of the disk and
the brightness maxima are traced well by the best-ﬁt spiral arm
coordinates. However, the radial and azimuthal protoplanet co-
ordinate solutions show a degenerate correlation since the proto-
planet coordinates could be located somewhere along the spiral

5. Discussion
5.1. Shadows as a probe for inner disk dynamics
The polarized scattered light
the disk around
HD 135344B that we have obtained with SPHERE show mul-
tiple decreases in surface brightness. We interpret those as shad-
ows that are cast by gas and dust structures in the vicinity of
the star. Interestingly, a comparison of two observation epochs
shows indication of variability of one shadow feature. Even
though SPHERE/ZIMPOL has the smallest radius of conﬁdence
of any direct imaging instrument in the optical and near-infrared
available today, the inner disk lies at an expected angular sepa-
ration of ∼ 7 mas which is well beyond the reach of SPHERE.
Therefore, the shadow features and their variability provide a
unique way of probing the dynamics of the innermost disk
regions. Total intensity images that have been obtained with
SPHERE will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Maire et al.,
in prep.).

The shape and location of the shadow features is determined
by the orientation and geometry of the shadow casting mate-
rial. Possible explanations include an inner disk component with
a relative inclination to the outer disk similar to HD 142527
(Marino et al. 2015), a warp that connects the inner disk and

dius of ∼ 0.06 au. This corresponds to an orbital period of ∼ 4
days which matches well with the 5.7 days periodicity of the Hα
emission found by Müller et al. (2011).

5.2. On the origin of the spiral arms
Mechanisms that can be responsible for spiral arms in protoplan-
etary disks include planet-disk interactions, gravitational insta-
bilities and stellar perturbations. However, which of those sce-
narios is related to the spiral arms that are currently observed is
still debated and we will discuss these scenarios in the context
of HD 135344B.

Protoplanets embedded in a gaseous disk are known to ex-
cite density waves over a range of mth order azimuthal modes
which results in a one-armed spiral by their constructive in-
terference. If the planet-to-star mass ratio is small such that
Mp/M∗ << (H(r)/r)3, then a linear perturbation can be applied
and the shape of the spiral arm is approximated by the analyti-
cal expression of equation 6. When the interaction with the disk
is stronger, the high order perturbations from the mth order az-
imuthal modes have to be considered which requires a non-linear
approach of the perturbation theory (Juhász et al. 2015; Zhu et al.
2015).
Several authors have shown, using 3D hydrodynamical and
radiative transfer simulations, that a massive, Mp/M∗ (cid:38) 10−3,
protoplanet in the exterior of the disk will excite both the m=1
and m=2 spiral arm with the morphology and surface bright-
ness contrast similar to HD 135344B and MWC 758 (Dong et al.
2015; Zhu et al. 2015; Fung & Dong 2015). Our spiral arm
ﬁtting shows that a protoplanet location exterior to the spiral
arms requires a reasonable aspect ratio of the disk compared
to a protoplanet interior of the spiral arms. However, this as-
sumes that each spiral arm is excited by an individual low-mass,
Mp/M∗ (cid:46) 10−3, planet whereas the surface brightness contrast,
pitch angle and symmetry of the spiral arms that are observed in
the HD 135344B disk indicate that a Mp/M∗ (cid:38) 6 × 10−3 proto-
planet has perturbed the disk (Dong et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015;
Fung & Dong 2015).

The gap that is opened by a protoplanet is approximately
equal to the Hill radius, RH = r(q/3)1/3 with q the planet-stellar
mass ratio, but can be as wide as 5 RH (Dodson-Robinson &
Salyk 2011). The millimeter dust on the other hand will accu-
mulate at larger distance and the millimeter gap can be ∼ 10
RH for massive, M (cid:38) 5 MJup, protoplanet (Pinilla et al. 2012).
A massive protoplanet exterior of the spiral arms is expected to
have opened a wide gap that might have been visible with the
current angular resolution of ALMA observations (Pérez et al.
2014; Pinilla et al. 2015). In addition, we detect the disk in po-
larized scattered light out to 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 with no gap detected exterior
of the spiral arms (see ﬁgure 3). This does not mean that no gap
can be present in the exterior of the disk since the gap could be
embedded in case the radius that is cleared by the protoplanet is
smaller than the disk height.

The stability of a protoplanetary disk against self-gravity is
quantiﬁed by the Toomre parameter which is given by (Toomre
1964)

band 7 (0.85 mm) continuum emission as presented by Pinilla
et al. (2015) for which we calculate the total ﬂux density in 20
linearly spaced radial bins from 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 to 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. The ALMA band 9
emission is optically thin throughout the disk (Pinilla et al. 2015)
such that the disk mass is given by

where Fν is the ﬂux density, d is the distance to the source, κν is
the dust opacity and Bν(T) is the Planck function. The millime-
ter opacity is approximated by κν = 0.1(ν/1012Hz) cm2 g−1 from
Beckwith et al. (1990) which implicitly includes a gas-to-dust
ratio of Ξ = 100 and has a typical opacity slope for a proto-
planetary disk in which grain growth has occurred (Testi et al.
2014). It should be noted that Carmona et al. (2014) estimated a
gas-to-dust ratio of 4 for the outer disk of HD 135344B from de-
tailed modelling of line observations in which case the gas would
be strongly depleted in the disk. However, van der Marel et al.
(2016) obtained a gas-to-dust ratio of 80 from CO line observa-
tions with ALMA.
The estimated Toomre parameter is presented in ﬁgure 10
and shows a minimum of Q ∼ 10 around 80 au which is an
order of magnitude above the Toomre criterion when we use a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100. One should be aware that the deriva-
tion of the Toomre parameter contains a number of uncertain-
ties and assumptions. For example, the disk mass depends on
the dust opacities which can diﬀer signiﬁcantly between homo-

geneous spheres and porous aggregates (Min et al. 2016). The
temperature is calculated for an optically thin disk while in re-
ality the disk will become optically thick at the outer disk rim
radius which will lower the Toomre parameter. Also, we have
assumed that the millimeter sized grains contain most of the dust
mass whereas centimeter sized grains will contribute to the total
dust mass as well.

Transition disks are known to harbour large dust cavities and
in some cases spiral arms. The presence of spiral arms could be
related to such a cavity since gas will partially be hold back at
the outer disk rim by the angular momentum exchange with the
cavity carving protoplanet. This could locally push the disk to-
wards an marginally gravitationally unstable regime. A marginal
instability in the HD 135344B disk could have enhanced the am-
plitude and pitch angle of the spiral arms when triggered by one
or multiple protoplanets (Pohl et al. 2015). In that case, a proto-
planet in the dust cavity could be responsible for an large pitch
angle spiral arm. However, a second protoplanet would be re-
quired to explain the second spiral arm and the two protoplanets
need the right coordinates and planet-to-star mass ratios to ex-
plain the amplitude and symmetry of the spiral arms.

Spiral arms can also originate from tidal interaction with a
stellar companion (Quillen et al. 2005; Boss 2006). Although
HD 135344B is part of a binary system, the projected separation
with the HD 135344 is 2940 au and Garuﬁ et al. (2013) argue that
a tidal perturbation would only be possible with an highly eccen-
tric orbit (e > 0.9) in which case the closest approach is ∼ 150
au. In contrast to the recently discovered spiral arms in the disk
of HD 100453 whose stellar companion is at a projected distance
of 120 au in which case a stellar perturbation could be respon-
sible for the observed spiral arms. The visibility timescale of a
density wave that is triggered by a stellar companion on a wide
orbit is governed by the sound speed, τsound ∼ Rout/cs, which
is approximately 5 × 104 yr for HD 135344B. More speciﬁcally,
the density wave traverses the disk with the sound speed and will
not be visible anymore after this timescale when the separation
is again too large for a tidal interaction. The orbital timescale of
the widely separated stellar companion is τorbit ∼ 106 yr which
is signiﬁcantly larger than the sound speed timescale. Conse-
quently, it seems unlikely that a tidal interaction with the stellar
companion caused the spiral arms in the disk of HD 135344B.

5.3. The interplay of surface and midplane
Protoplanetary disks are optically thick at optical and near-
infrared wavelengths such that scattered light observations trace
the disk surface. Depending on the optical depth, disk emission
at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths traces the temperature and/or
surface density of the millimeter dust grains. Here we will dis-
cuss our PDI observations in the context of ALMA band 9 and
band 7 observations by Pérez et al. (2014) and Pinilla et al.
(2015), respectively.

Our PDI observations show an overall positive polarized sur-
face brightness gradient towards the SW side of the disk in the
r2-scaled Qφ images of all photometric ﬁlters. The gradient fol-
lows approximately the major axis and can not be attributed to
forward scattering. In addition, no strong forward scattering ef-
fect is expected given the low inclination of the disk. Thus, the
overal surface brightness gradient is presumably related to the
local aspect ratio of the disk which is not azimuthally symmet-
ric. A local increase in scale height, surface density or turbulence
will alter the eﬀective cross section and optical depth of the disk
which results in a change in scattered light ﬂux directed towards
the observer. Interestingly, the surface brightness asymmetry is

Gaussian kernel to match the angular resolution of the ALMA image by
Pérez et al. (2014). We used the major- and minor axis from the ALMA
beam which are 132 and 94 mas, respectively, and shown on the bottom
left. The overlaid contours show the ALMA Band 9 (0.45 mm) dust

observed on a global scale up to 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 ((cid:39) 140 au) as shown in
ﬁgure 3. We ﬁnd that the integrated surface brightness is 9.2%
larger on the west side of the disk compared to the east side by
adding all Qφ pixel values between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 in two position
angle bins from 45◦ to 135◦ and from 225◦ to 315◦ for east and
west, respectively.

The disk around HD 135344B was estimated to be
marginally optically thick at the peak of the emission of the
ALMA band 9 continuum (0.44 mm) (Pérez et al. 2014) and the
emission from this region is expected to trace the temperature
rather than surface density. The disk emission shows a crescent-
shaped asymmetry with a factor 2 brightness contrast between
the peak of the emission and the opposite side of the disk. ALMA
band 7 (0.89 mm) shows a similar asymmetry but with a rota-
tional oﬀset with respect to the band 9 image (Pinilla et al. 2015).
This could be a result of a diﬀerence in optical depth with band
9 tracing the temperature and band 7 the surface density. Particle
trapping in vortices will be more conﬁned at longer wavelengths
whereas the ALMA observations show a similar azimuthal width
of the asymmetry indicating that the asymmetry might be related
to the spiral arms instead of a vortex (Pinilla et al. 2015)

Figure 11 shows the r2-scaled J-band Qφ image that is con-
volved with the ALMA beam and the contour overlay shows the
ALMA band 9 emission from Pérez et al. (2014). The brightness
maximum of both observations approximately overlap which
could be an indication that the asymmetry in the ALMA observa-
tions are related to the spiral arms in the PDI image (Pérez et al.
2014). More speciﬁcally, the crescent-shaped asymmetry might
be resolved into spiral arms by employing the longest baselines
available for ALMA (Quanz 2015). Note that an oﬀset between
the peak in emission of the scattered light and millimeter emis-

sion is expected due to the inclination and vertical extent of the
disk.

Spiral arms possess an angular pattern velocity which is
equal to the Keplerian angular velocity of the protoplanet by
which it is triggered. Shocks are generated as the spiral arms
traverse the protoplanetary disk and heat release will locally
change the scale height of the disk. Also the gas surface den-
sity is expected to be larger within the spiral arms. It was shown
by Juhász et al. (2015) that density perturbations alone are likely
not enough to explain the surface brightness contrast of the ob-
served spiral arms and an increase in local temperature is re-
quired to make to spiral arms visible. This is in agreement with
the ALMA band 9 image which presumable traces the tempera-
ture of the disk and shows a peak in emission around the location
were the polarized surface brightness is highest. However, it was
argued by Dong et al. (2015) and Zhu et al. (2015) that with 3D
hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations it is possible
to explain the observed surface brightness contrast of the spiral
arms with surface density perturbations alone.

The strength of a planet-induced spiral arm can be assumed
to have a power-law proﬁle in radial direction with respect to the
perturbing protoplanet (Raﬁkov 2002; Juhász et al. 2015). This
could imply that a protoplanet is located in the SW side of the
S1 spiral arm which shows the highest surface brightness con-
trast with respect to the background disk in the r2-scaled images.
More speciﬁcally, a kink is visible in the S1 spiral arm (see ﬁg-
ure 4) which could be related to its launching point (Muto et al.
2012). Fitting of the spiral arms did not result in a solution at the
location of the spiral arm kink but ﬁgure 9 shows that the surface
brightness maxima deviate from the best-ﬁt solutions around this
location.

6. Conclusions
We have carried out VLT/SPHERE polarimetric diﬀerential
imaging observations in R- and I-band with SPHERE/ZIMPOL
and Y- and J-band with SPHERE/IRDIS which revealed the
transition disk around HD 135344B with unprecedented sensi-
tivity and angular resolution. We have studied the morphology
and surface brightness of the disk in the context of the inner disk
dynamics, the origin of the spiral arms, dust grain properties and
the interplay of surface and midplane. We used the 3D radiative
transfer code MCMax3D to explain the origin of shadow fea-
tures A, B and D that were discovered. Our conclusions are:
– Multiple low surface brightness regions are discovered that
we interpret as shadows casts by the innermost disk regions.
An inner disk component that is 22◦ inclined with respect to
the outer disk can explain two of the shadow lanes. In ad-
dition, a fainter disk region which is bound by two shadow
lanes is likely the result of the warped disk region that con-
nects the inner disk and the cavity. The third shadow lane
shows variability in its location between two epochs and ap-
pears to be slightly tilted in azimuthal direction. These prop-
erties point to an accretion funnel ﬂow from the inner disk
onto the star which orbits the star at sub-au distance.

– The large pitch angle and surface brightness contrast of the
spiral arms indicate that the disk might be perturbed by a
massive protoplanet which is able to reveal both the m=1
and m=2 mode of the density wave. Alternatively, the disk
could be marginally gravitationally unstable in which case
two protoplanets can be responsible for both the cavity and
the two spiral arms. However, our Toomre parameter esti-
mate is likely an lower limit and current gas mass estimates

of the outer disk suggest that the disk is not gravitationally
unstable.

– The polarized surface brightness shows a positive gradient
towards the SW side of the disk in the irradiation-corrected
Qφ images. The peak of the r2-scaled scattered light approx-
imately coincides with the millimeter continuum emission
indicating that the temperature and surface density is locally
aﬀected by the passing spiral arm due to shocks that release
heat into the disk environment.

– The disk color in polarized light is red which is an indication
that large dust grains dominate the scattering opacity in the
disk surface for which 2πa (cid:38) λ. The surface dust grains are
expected to have an aggregate structure since large compact
dust grains will settle towards the disk midplane eﬃciently
and not be visible in scattered light.

– As a result of the excellent performance of SPHERE, we
have detected a non-azimuthal polarization signal in the Uφ
image of our J-band observations which is likely the result
of multiple scattered photons in the disk.

Appendix A: Photometric calibration
A photometric calibration is required for a comparison of the
polarized surface brightness of the ZIMPOL and IRDIS detec-
tor. Here we will explain the calibration procedure which has
been carried out slightly in a diﬀerent manner for the ZIMPOL
and IRDIS observations leading to diﬀerences in precision of the
calibration.

For the ZIMPOL photometric calibration, the zero point
magnitude for the R- and I-band ﬁlter is 24.29 and 23.55, respec-
tively (Schmid et al., in prep.). We ﬁrst correct the pixel counts
of both the Qφ and Uφ image for the DIT such that pixel val-
ues are in counts s−1. Next, we calculate the magnitude in each
pixel of our image and translate this into a surface brightness.
The magnitude per pixel of our ZIMPOL observations is given
by (Schmid et al., in prep.)
m∗(F) = −2.5 log ¯C∗(F) + zp(F) − X K1(F) − mmode(F),
(A.1)
where ¯C∗ is the mean count rate in each pixel, K1(F) is the at-
mospheric extinction parameter for a given photometric ﬁlter F,
X is the airmass of our observations and mmode is a correction of
the zero point for the instrument conﬁguration. We use the air-
mass from table 2 with K1(F) = 0.106 mag am−1 for both the R-
and I-band ﬁlter. The instrumental mode correction for SlowPol
mode of ZIMPOL is mmode = −1.93 (Schmid et al., in prep.).
The magnitude per pixel is translated into a surface brightness
with (Quanz et al. 2011)
S = m∗ + 2.5 log A,
where A is the square of the pixel scale in arcsec2 and S is in
mag arcsec−2. The uncertainty in the ZIMPOL photometric cal-
ibration is approximately 10%.

(A.2)

As a photometric check, we determine the magnitude of
HD 135344B from our data and compare this with a literature
value. We use the unsaturated frames that were obtained at the
end of the ZIMPOL observations and correct those for both the
DIT and the response function of the neutral density ﬁlter. We
subtract 0.1 counts s−1 from each pixel to correct for the dark
current level of a 10 s DIT with ZIMPOL as estimated from
the PSF proﬁle. All pixel values in the reduced ﬂux frame are
integrated and we assume this to be the photometric signal of
HD 135344B. From equation A.1, we obtain a magnitude of 8.40
and 7.92 for R- and I-band, respectively, which are very similar
to the literature values given in table 1.

For the IRDIS observations, we carry out a more approxi-
mate photometric calibration as described in Quanz et al. (2011)
which leads to a larger photometric uncertainty than the ZIM-
POL calibration. The J-band observations were carried out with
a coronagraph but non-coronagraphic frames were obtained at
the start and end of the observation. For these integrations, a
smaller DIT was chosen and a neutral density ﬁlter was used to
prevent a saturation of the PSF on the IRDIS detector. The IRDIS
Y-band observations were carried out without coronagraph and
all frames are saturated in the PSF core. No unsaturated frames
were obtained during the HWP experiment and we can not per-
form a photometric calibration for this data set.

We determine the detector integrated count rate from a re-
duced, unsaturated frame in J-band and assume this to be the
photometric signal from HD 135344B. Next, we correct both the
total intensity frame, the Qφ frame and the Uφ frame for their
DIT (see table 2). We use the ﬁlter response curves to correct
the total intensity frame for the transmissivity of the J-band ﬁl-
ter and the neutral density ﬁlter. Now we can estimate the zero

Fig. B.1. Azimuthally averaged polarized surface brightness around the
outer disk rim location. The proﬁles are shown in normalized units and
with arbitrary oﬀsets. We have used 100 and 50 linearly spaced bins
between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)35 for the ZIMPOL and IRDIS data, respectively.
Data points show the mean Qφ value with 1 standard deviation from the
corresponding Uφ bin. A weighted least squares ﬁt of a Gaussian proﬁle
is done for the points between 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 with the weight provided by
1 standard deviation from the Uφ bin. The best-ﬁt values are given in
table 3 and the solid lines in this ﬁgure.

point of the IRDIS J-band observation by comparing the detec-
tor integrated J-band ﬂux with the 2MASS magnitude. The zero
point count rate is given by (Quanz et al. 2011):
IZP = ICR100.4m2MASS ,
where ICR is the detector integrated count rate and m2MASS the
2MASS magnitude of HD 135344B. From the inversion of equa-
tion A.3, we can convert the count rate for each pixel to magni-
tude and subsequently to surface brightness (see equation A.2).
Note that the IRDIS photometric calibration includes a number
of uncertainties and assumptions which leads to an estimated
precision of only 30-40%.

Appendix B: Outer disk rim
The azimuthally averaged polarized surface brightness around
the outer disk rim location is shown in ﬁgure B.1 for R-, I-, Y-
and J-band. The proﬁles are normalized and shown with an ar-
bitrary oﬀset. We perform a weighted least squares ﬁt of a Gaus-
sian proﬁle with the weights given by 1 standard deviation in
the corresponding Uφ bin at the same radius. This provides us
with the radial location of the brightness maximum of the rim
and the width of the brightness proﬁle which is the FWHM of
the Gaussian proﬁle. The derived values are provided in table 3
and are very similar for all ﬁlters. The errors are derived from
the χ2 minimization and are smaller than the spatial uncertainty
from the pixel scales. Spatial segregation of diﬀerent dust grain
sizes is expected to occur around a gap edge as predicted by de
Juan Ovelar et al. (2013). The resolved millimeter cavity is in-
deed larger than the scattered light cavity of the HD 135344B
disk (Garuﬁ et al. 2013). The ZIMPOL and IRDIS observations
do not show evidence of a wavelength dependence in the loca-
tion and width of the outer disk rim.

The scatter light from the outer disk rim peaks at 24.8 au
(see table 3) and the azimuthally averaged proﬁle around the rim
location has a FWHM of approximately 90 mas (12.6 au) and
is resolved with both the ZIMPOL and IRDIS observations (see
section 2). We use the surface brightness of the outer disk rim
to estimate the orientation and possible oﬀ-set of the outer disk
assuming that the deprojected outer rim is circular in shape. For
this, we apply the modiﬁed maximum merit method as described
in Thalmann et al. (2015) which maximizes the surface bright-
ness diﬀerence between two bounded elliptical annuli. We use
the Qφ J-band image which is scaled with the square of the pro-
jected distance in order to not introduce any bias on the inclina-
tion, i, and position angle, Ω, that we want to ﬁt.

We sample 106 ellipses with semi-major axis, a, and semi-
minor axis, b, and with an oﬀset, (x, y), with respect to the cen-
tral star. From each set of (a, b, x, y) we construct two elliptical
annuli which are bounded by (a − δ, b − b
a δ, x, y), (a, b, x, y) and
(a + δ, b + b
a δ, x, y) with an annulus width of δ = 48 mas (the an-
gular resolution of the IRDIS J-band observation). Next, we de-
termine the mean pixel value in each of the two annuli. The merit
function β(a, b, x, y) is deﬁned as the diﬀerence of the mean pixel
value between the outer and inner annulus. Consequently, maxi-
mizing the merit function leads to the largest surface brightness
gradient. The uncertainty in the best-ﬁt solution βmax is deter-
mined by deﬁning a set of solutions for which β > βmax − σβ,
where σβ is the standard deviation of the merits of the unscaled
Uφ image for the same sets of ellipses. For each parameter, we
use the maximum deviation within this set of solutions as the
error estimate.

The best-ﬁt parameters and their uncertainties for the modi-
ﬁed maximum merit method are given in table 3. Clearly, all pa-
rameter solutions are highly degenerate except for the major- and
minor-axis. The reason for this is the near face-on orientation of
the outer disk and azimuthal changes in surface brightness that
are not related to the orientation of the disk. The estimated incli-
nation of the outer disk is (cid:46) 13◦ which is in agreement with typ-
ical literature values for the outer disk inclination (Grady et al.
2009; Dent et al. 2005; Pontoppidan et al. 2008; Pani´c & Hoger-
heijde 2009; Andrews et al. 2011; Lyo et al. 2011).

Appendix C: Spiral arm ﬁtting probabilities
Figure C.1 shows the 2D Bayesian probability distributions of
each set of free parameters that were used for the simultane-
ously ﬁtting of spiral arm S1 and S2 as explained in section
4.2. The marginalized probabilities are shown in the top row
of each column. The Bayesian probabilities are determined with
exp (−χ2/2) from the χ2 solutions and normalized to a probabil-
ity integrated value of unity.
