Thermal Pressures in the Interstellar Medium of the Magellanic Clouds1

Daniel E. Welty1, James T. Lauroesch2, Tony Wong3, Donald G. York1,4

ABSTRACT

We discuss the thermal pressures (nHT ) in predominantly cold, neutral interstellar
gas in the Magellanic Clouds, derived from analyses of the ﬁne-structure excitation of
neutral carbon, as seen in high-resolution HST/STIS spectra of seven diverse sight lines
in the LMC and SMC. Detailed ﬁts to the line proﬁles of the absorption from C I,
C I*, and C I** yield consistent column densities for the 3–6 C I multiplets detected
in each sight line. In the LMC and SMC, N (C Itot) is consistent with Galactic trends
versus N (Na I) and N (CH), but is slightly lower versus N (K I) and N (H2). As for
N (Na I) and N (K I), N (C Itot) is generally signiﬁcantly lower, for a given N (Htot),
in the LMC and (especially) in the SMC, compared to the local Galactic relationship.
For the LMC and SMC components with well determined column densities for C I,
C I*, and C I**, the derived thermal pressures are typically factors of a few higher than
the values found for most cold, neutral clouds in the Galactic ISM. Such diﬀerences are
consistent with the predictions of models for clouds in systems (like the LMC and SMC)
that are characterized by lower metallicities, lower dust-to-gas ratios, and enhanced
radiation ﬁelds – where higher pressures are required for stable cold, neutral clouds.
The pressures may be further enhanced by energetic activity (e.g., due to stellar winds,
star formation, and/or supernova remnants) in several of the regions probed by these
sight lines. Comparisons are made with the C I observed in some quasar absorption-line
systems.

INTRODUCTION

The total interstellar pressure required for hydrostatic equilibrium in the Galactic disk, of
order ptot/k ∼ 2.8 × 104 cm−3K, includes contributions from magnetic ﬁelds, cosmic rays, and
both thermal and turbulent motions of the gas (e.g., Boulares & Cox 1990). Models of interstellar
clouds that include all signiﬁcant heating and cooling processes (e.g., Wolﬁre et al. 1995, 2003)
predict two stable phases for predominantly neutral clouds – a cold neutral phase (CNM), with
T . 200 K, and a warm neutral phase (WNM), with T ∼ 104 K. For Wolﬁre et al.’s (2003)
”standard model” of the local Galactic interstellar medium (ISM), both of those phases can be
present for thermal pressures p/k = nHT ∼ 2.0–4.8 × 103 cm−3K. While the thermal pressure
thus is generally only a minor contributor to the total interstellar pressure, it nevertheless provides
important information on the local physical conditions and processes in the ISM. For example, the
thermal pressure apparently is proportional to both the (larger) turbulent pressure (Joung et al.
2009) and the local heating and star-formation rates (Ostriker et al. 2010).

For relatively cold, neutral gas, the thermal pressure is often estimated via analysis of the
excitation of neutral carbon, for which the populations of the two upper 3P1 and 3P2 ﬁne-structure
levels in the ground electronic state (denoted C I* and C I**, with excitation energies E/k = 23.6
and 62.4 K, respectively) are determined principally by a balance between collisional excitation,
collisional de-excitation, and radiative decay (Jenkins & Shaya 1979). A recent general survey of
the C I absorption and excitation in the Galactic ISM, based on high-resolution UV spectra of 89
stars obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), has indicated that most of the gas traced by C I is characterized by relatively low
thermal pressures, but that there is generally also a small fraction of gas (typically less than 10%)
at much higher pressures (Jenkins & Tripp 2011; hereafter JT11; see also Jenkins & Tripp 2001
and Burgh et al. 2010). The dominant low-pressure component corresponding to the ”center of
mass” of the distribution of C I populations in JT11’s full data set has log(p/k)low ∼ 3.60 (cm−3K),
which corresponds to a local hydrogen density nH = 50 cm−3 for a representative T = 80 K.

The Magellanic Clouds are characterized by lower metallicities [factors of about 2 (LMC) and
5 (SMC) below Solar values], dust-to-gas ratios correspondingly lower than those found in the lo-
cal Galactic ISM (e.g., Welty et al. 2012; Roman-Duval et al. 2014), and generally stronger UV
radiation ﬁelds (e.g., Lequeux 1989; Bernard et al. 2008; Sandstrom et al. 2010). Those environ-
mental diﬀerences are predicted to aﬀect the structure, chemistry, and physical characteristics of
interstellar clouds in the LMC and SMC (e.g., Maloney & Black 1988; Wolﬁre et al. 1995, 2003;
Johansson 1997; Pak et al. 1998). In particular, photodissociation regions are expected to be more
extensive, molecular cores (as traced by CO emission) are expected to be smaller, and somewhat
higher thermal pressures should be needed to maintain stable cold, neutral clouds in such environ-
ments. Some evidence for the predicted higher thermal pressures in diﬀuse atomic and molecular
gas in the Magellanic Clouds may be gleaned from moderate-resolution UV spectra of C I (Welty
et al. 1999a; Koenigsberger et al. 2001; Andr´e et al. 2004), from the elevated J=4,5 populations
of H2 (Tumlinson et al. 2002; Cartledge et al. 2005; Xue et al., in preparation), and from the

– 3 –

rotational excitation of C2 toward one SMC star (Welty et al. 2013). The limited resolution of
the previously reported C I and H2 spectra, however, generally allows only average values of the
excitation to be estimated for those typically complex lines of sight; higher resolution spectra are
needed to determine the characteristics of individual clouds in the LMC and SMC. Higher densities
have also been inferred for denser clouds more closely related to star formation (e.g., van Loon et
al. 2010), consistent with theoretical expectations for lower metallicity systems (e.g., Krumholz et
al. 2009). And while [C I] emission from the ﬁrst excited ﬁne-structure level (3P1 → 3P0; at 609
µm) has been detected at several locations in the LMC and SMC (Stark et al. 1997; Bolatto et al.
2000a, 2000b), with I[CI]/ICO comparable to or slightly greater than the values found for similar
Galactic regions, the total abundance and excitation of C I cannot be directly determined from
those observations.

A more detailed understanding of the abundance and excitation of C I in the Magellanic Clouds
should also aid in understanding the C I seen in some quasar absorption-line systems – many of
which also have sub-Solar metallicities (Songaila et al. 1994; Roth & Bauer 1999; Quast et al. 2002;
Srianand et al. 2005; Jorgenson et al. 2010; Carswell et al. 2011; Ledoux et al. 2015). Detectable
C I may be a useful indicator of the presence of colder, denser gas with higher molecular content
in those more distant systems (Papadopoulos et al. 2004; Srianand et al. 2005; Glover & Clark
2016), and its excitation can provide both information on local physical conditions and constraints
on the redshift dependence of the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

In this paper, we describe analyses of the C I ﬁne-structure excitation in the ISM of the
Magellanic Clouds – based on the C I absorption seen in high-resolution STIS echelle spectra
of seven stars in the LMC and SMC – which indicate systematically higher thermal pressures
there. Section 2 describes the sight line sample, the optical and UV spectra obtained for the seven
stars, and the analysis of the absorption-line proﬁles seen in those spectra. Section 3 presents the
abundances and excitation of C I derived from the UV spectra and the thermal pressures estimated
from the C I excitation. Section 4 discusses the newly derived thermal pressures, in relation to
cloud models and to the environments probed by the seven SMC and LMC sight lines, and makes
comparisons with the C I seen in more distant quasar absorption-line systems. Section 5 gives a
summary of our results and conclusions. Several appendices present the full set of C I proﬁles,
the detailed component structures derived from our proﬁle ﬁts, and compilations of the Galactic
column densities, Magellanic Clouds carbon abundances, and quasar absorber C I column densities
used in the main body of the paper. A subsequent paper will focus on the elemental abundances
and depletions found for ﬁve of these sight lines (Welty et al., in preparation).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Sight lines

Basic data for the seven sight lines included in this study are given in Table 1; some additional
information on nearby (and possibly associated) CO emission and H II regions is given in Table 2.
All seven sight lines have been observed with both HST/STIS and FUSE in the UV – yielding
column densities for both H and H2 (Tumlinson et al. 2002; Cartledge et al. 2005; Welty et al.
2012; Xue et al., in preparation) and for various atomic and molecular species (Friedman et al. 2000;
Welty et al. 2001, 2004, and in preparation; Andr´e et al. 2004; Soﬁa et al. 2006; Tchernyshyov
et al. 2015). The total neutral hydrogen column densities N (Htot) = N (H) + 2N (H2) range from
about 1.1–11.5 × 1021 cm−2, with molecular fractions f (H2) = 2N (H2)/N (Htot) from 0.01–0.63.
All seven have also been observed with ground-based spectrographs, for investigations of various
constituents of the ISM in the SMC and LMC (e.g., Caulet & Newell 1996; Cox et al. 2006,
2007; Welty et al. 2006, 2013; Howk et al. 2012; Welty & Crowther 2010 and in preparation).2
While most of the stars appear to be located in or near H II regions and/or signiﬁcant amounts of
molecular material (e.g., Henize 1956; Davies et al. 1976; Israel et al. 1993, 2003; Bica et al. 2008;
Wong et al. 2011), the sight lines probe a number of diﬀerent regions in the SMC and LMC, and
the interstellar material observed along them exhibits a range of properties:

• Both Sk 13 and Sk 18 are located in the N19 complex of H II regions, supernova remnants,
and molecular gas in the southwest part of the main SMC ”bar”, near DEM 31 and DEM 32,
respectively (Rubio et al. 1993; Rosado et al. 1994; Dickel et al. 2001; Bot et al. 2010).
The sight line to Sk 13 exhibits ”typical” SMC extinction, with no 2175 ˚A bump and a very
steep far-UV rise (Gordon et al. 2003). Soﬁa et al. (2006) have discussed the abundances of
several species detected in the STIS spectra of Sk 13; the overall Ti depletion3 toward Sk 18
is relatively mild, despite the fairly high molecular fraction (Welty & Crowther 2010).

• Sk 143 is located between the northeastern end of the SMC ”bar” and the SMC ”wing” region,
and appears to be associated with the diﬀuse H II region DEM 140. This sight line is unusual
in the SMC, with the UV extinction curve, the dust-to-gas ratio, and the relative abundances
of a number of atomic and molecular species more similar to those found in the local Galactic
ISM (Gordon et al. 2003; Welty et al. 2006, 2012; Cox et al. 2007). To this point, it has

2Some information about these and other SMC and LMC sight lines, with plots of the optical spectra, may
be found at http://astro.uchicago.edu/∼dwelty/mcoptuv.html. Optical/IR images of the regions around each
star and links to the FUSE spectra may be found at the FUSE Magellanic Clouds Legacy Project website
(https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/fuse mc/; Blair et al. 2009; see also Danforth et al. 2002).

3In low-metallicity systems, the depletions are determined relative to the overall metallicity of the system. For the
SMC and LMC, the metallicities have been estimated from the abundances of various elements measured in relatively
young stars and nebulae. For quasar absorption-line systems, the metallicities are estimated from the gas-phase
abundances of typically mildly depleted elements (e.g., Zn, or perhaps O, Si, and/or S), relative to Htot.

both the only detections of Li I, CN, C2, and C3 absorption and the most severe depletion
of Ti known in the SMC; the ratio of the local hydrogen density to the strength of the UV
radiation ﬁeld (nH/IUV) appears to be higher than for other sight lines in the SMC (Welty et
al. 2006, 2013; Welty & Crowther 2010; Howk et al. 2012; see also Soﬁa et al. 2006). CO is
detected in absorption in the STIS spectrum, but has not been detected in emission toward
Sk 143 (Rubio et al. 1993b).

• Sk 155 is the only blue supergiant in the NGC 460b stellar association, located toward the
N84 complex of H II regions and molecular gas in the near ”wing” region of the SMC (Bolatto
et al. 2003; Leroy et al. 2009). There is no apparent associated nebulosity (Testor & Lortet
1987), however, and comparisons of the strengths and velocities of the interstellar emission
and absorption features in this sight line indicate that much of the material (both neutral and
ionized) seen in emission is located behind the star (Welty et al. 2012 and in preparation).
The mild depletions of Mg, Si, and Ti seen for several of the SMC components – compared
to the severe depletions of Fe and Ni – are indicative of depletion patterns unlike those seen
in the local Galactic ISM (Welty et al. 2001 and in preparation; Welty & Crowther 2010; cf.
Soﬁa et al. 2006).

• Sk−67 5 is located in a diﬀuse H II region (N3, DEM 7) in the northwestern part of the LMC.
Friedman et al. (2000) and Andr´e et al. (2004) have discussed the interstellar absorption seen
in early FUSE and optical spectra; analysis of the higher-resolution STIS spectra indicates
that most of the interstellar components exhibit fairly uniform, relatively mild depletions
(Welty et al. 2004 and in preparation; Welty & Crowther 2010).

• Sk−68 73 is a member of the LH 49 association, in the southern part of the N44 complex
of H II regions and molecular gas located in the central part of the LMC, and appears to be
responsible for ionizing the N44H H II region (Megnier et al. 1996; Kim et al. 1998; Chen
et al. 2009). The sight line lies within the contours of CO emission in the recent MAGMA
survey of the LMC (Wong et al. 2011), and CO absorption is detected in the FUSE spectrum
(Welty et al., in preparation). The overall depletion of Ti is slightly more severe than for
several other LMC sight lines with similar f (H2) (Welty & Crowther 2010).

• Sk−70 115, the most luminous star in the LH 117 association (Lucke & Hodge 1970; Massey
et al. 1989), is located near the edge of the LMC2 region (southeast of 30 Dor), and ap-
pears to be associated with the N180 H II region. Other stars in that region (including the
nearby Sk−70 116) exhibit UV extinction curves with a weak 2175 ˚A bump and relatively
steep far-UV rise (Gordon et al. 2003). The various interstellar components exhibit marked
diﬀerences in Ti depletion – severe in the main 220 km s−1 component, but mild in many
of the components at higher velocities (Caulet & Newell 1996; Welty & Crowther 2010); the
relatively mild depletions of Mg and Si in the 220 km s−1 component are reminiscent of the
unusual depletion patterns seen toward Sk 155 (Welty et al. 2004 and in preparation).

2.2. Optical spectra

The good correlations and nearly linear relationships between the column densities of the
trace neutral species C I, Na I, and K I found in the Galactic ISM (Jenkins & Shaya 1979; Welty
& Hobbs 2001) suggest that those three species are similarly distributed and respond similarly to
local physical conditions in the ISM (e.g., density, radiation ﬁeld) – and thus that high-resolution
and/or high-S/N ratio optical spectra of Na I and K I absorption can be used to help interpret
the absorption from C I observed (generally at lower resolution and/or S/N ratio) in the UV.
For the seven sight lines considered in this paper, high-resolution (FWHM = 1.35–2.0 km s−1)
spectra of the Na I D lines near 5890 and 5896 ˚A were obtained with the ESO 3.6 m telescope
and coud´e echelle spectrograph (CES) during runs in 1998 and 2000, while spectra of somewhat
lower resolution (FWHM = 4.5–4.9 km s−1) but much higher S/N ratio were obtained for both
the Na I D lines and the weaker Na I U lines near 3302 ˚A with the ESO VLT-UT2 telescope
and UVES spectrograph in 2003 (Welty et al. 2006; Welty & Crowther 2010 and in preparation).
As described in detail by Welty & Crowther (in preparation), standard procedures within iraf
were used to obtain wavelength-calibrated 1-D extracted spectra from the raw 2-D spectral images.
Normalization of those spectra, measurement of the equivalent widths of the absorption lines, and
initial column density estimates based on the apparent optical depths (AOD) in the observed line
proﬁles were accomplished using a locally developed spectral analysis program (specp).

2.3. UV spectra

The seven Magellanic Clouds stars included in this study are the only ones for which high-
resolution (FWHM ∼ 2.7 km s−1) UV spectra covering a number of the C I multiplets have been
obtained. In each case, use of the STIS E140H echelle grating yielded a spectral segment of about
200 ˚A, centered on the nominal wavelength of the setting (1234, 1271, or 1307 ˚A) – thus including
the seven C I multiplets listed in Table 3.4 As the targets are all relatively faint (and somewhat
reddened), the total exposure times for those E140H settings ranged from about 2.8 hours for
Sk−67 5 (V ∼ 11.3) to about 17.7 hours for Sk 13 (V ∼ 12.5).

The default pipeline-extracted spectra were obtained from the MAST archive5, and the multi-
ple individual spectra for each sight line were combined via sinc interpolation to a common, slightly
over-sampled heliocentric wavelength grid. Because of the relatively low S/N ratios characterizing
the individual E140H spectra, it was generally diﬃcult to discern any systematic relative velocity

4The C I multiplets near 1188, 1192, 1193, 1194 ˚A were not used in this study, as (1) they were not covered in
some of the sight lines, (2) where they were covered, the S/N ratios are generally rather low, and (3) there is often
signiﬁcant blending with Galactic and/or Magellanic Clouds absorption from Cl I (λ1188), S III (λ1190), and/or
Si II (λ1190, λ1193).

oﬀsets among the individual spectra – so no oﬀsets were applied in combining the spectra. (Where
they can be measured, however, such oﬀsets are typically . 0.5 km s−1 for STIS E140H spectra.)
Spectral segments encompassing each of the C I multiplets were normalized via polynomial ﬁts to
the line-free regions in each segment; equivalent widths and AOD column density estimates were
measured for the unblended lines in those normalized spectra. The S/N ratios (per resolution
element) characterizing the spectra, gauged from ﬂuctuations in the continuum regions near the
C I multiplets, range from about 14–17 for Sk 143 to about 46–60 for Sk 155. The normalized
spectra of the C I multiplet near 1328 ˚A are shown, together with the corresponding spectra of
Na I λ5895, in Figures 1 (SMC) and 2 (LMC); the proﬁles of the ground state C I line and the Na I
line are strikingly similar. The spectra of all of the C I multiplets analyzed here (both Galactic
and Magellanic Clouds absorption) are shown in Appendix Figures 7 through 13.

2.4. Fits to line proﬁles

As seen for the local Galactic ISM, sight lines probing the ISM of the SMC and LMC can exhibit
complex structure, even when observed at only moderately high spectral resolution (FWHM ∼ 5
km s−1; e.g., Wayte 1990; Vladilo et al. 1993; van Loon et al. 2013); higher resolution spectra
(FWHM . 3 km s−1) typically reveal numerous narrow, closely-spaced components (Andreani et
al. 1987; Pettini & Gillingham 1988; Welty et al. 1999a, 2006; Welty & Crowther, in preparation).
Multicomponent ﬁts to the line proﬁles of the various C I multiplets were therefore used to obtain
the column densities of the ground and excited ﬁne-structure levels of C I for the components
discernible in our seven sight lines, using the program fits6p (e.g., Welty et al. 2003) and a
variant of that program which can ﬁt multiple, widely separated lines having a common component
structure. Such ﬁts explicitly account for the blending between lines from diﬀerent levels and
between diﬀerent interstellar components, as well as for possible saturation eﬀects in the stronger
absorption features. Potential disadvantages of this approach are the assumption of symmetric
Voigt proﬁles for each component and the somewhat subjective nature of deciding how many
components are present.6

In view of the generally good correlation between the column densities of C Itot

7 and Na I
and the apparent similarity of their line proﬁles (Figures 1 and 2), ﬁts to the highest resolution
Na I D-line proﬁles (Welty & Crowther, in preparation) were used to determine both the number
of components and the widths (b-values) and velocities of those components for the trace neutral
species in each of the sight lines.
In order to facilitate convergence, most of the component b-values
were held ﬁxed (at values determined by manual adjustment) in the ﬁnal iterative ﬁts to the proﬁles.
The b-values and column densities of the strongest Na I components were further constrained by
requiring consistent ﬁts for both the strong D lines (in both CES and UVES spectra) and the much
weaker U lines near 3302 ˚A. The adopted Na I component structures for these SMC and LMC
sight lines are given in Appendix Table 7. Toward the SMC, components at (heliocentric) velocities
less than about 80 km s−1 are assumed to arise in the Galactic disk and halo, while components
at higher velocities arise in the SMC. Toward the LMC, the dividing point between Galactic and
LMC components is assumed to be at about 100 km s−1 – though it is rare to detect absorption
from Na I in the intermediate-velocity gas between 100 and 200 km s−1 (e.g., Lehner et al. 2009;
Smoker et al. 2015; Welty & Crowther, in preparation). The SMC and LMC component Na I
b-values generally lie between 0.4 and 1.2 km s−1 – similar to the range found for most Galactic
Na I components from ﬁts to higher-resolution spectra (Welty et al. 1994; Welty & Crowther, in
preparation). The slightly higher median b-values for this small sample – about 0.8 km s−1 for the

6While the F-test has sometimes been used to determine how many components are required in such ﬁts, the

F-test appears not to be appropriate for that particular decision (Protassov et al. 2002).

7While the term C I in the text generally refers to neutral carbon (in whatever state), we follow JT11 in designating
the speciﬁc, individual column densities of the ground and excited ﬁne-structure states as N (C I), N (C I*), and
N (C I**), and of the total column density of C I (in all states) as N (C Itot).

– 13 –

Galactic components and 1.0 km s−1 for the Magellanic Clouds components, versus the 0.7 km s−1
found by Welty et al. (1994) – can probably be attributed to the lower resolution and modest S/N
ratios characterizing the present spectra.

The component structure derived for Na I was then used to ﬁt the various C I lines from
both ground and excited ﬁne-structure levels – varying only the column densities of the individual
components for each level and the slight overall velocity oﬀsets (generally less than 0.5 km s−1)
between the proﬁles of the diﬀerent multiplets. An instrumental width slightly larger than the
nominal 2.7 km s−1 was adopted, to account for the eﬀects of slight possible (uncorrected) oﬀsets
among the individual spectra contributing to the overall sums. Simultaneous ﬁts were performed
both to the unblended lines from several multiplets (separately for each level) and to all the lines
(from all three levels) for each individual multiplet. As for Na I, it was particularly valuable to
have spectra for C I lines characterized by a wide range in intrinsic strength (spanning a factor of
∼60 in f λ for the ground state lines of the various multiplets; Table 3). Given that range in line
strength, it was possible to derive reasonably well constrained values for both the b-values and the
column densities of the strongest C I components, by requiring consistent column densities for all
the multiplets. The resulting adopted b-values for the strongest C I components are typically ∼
0.1–0.2 km s−1 larger than those found for the corresponding components in Na I – consistent with
the smaller atomic weight of carbon, but perhaps also suggestive of a slightly broader distribution
for C I than for Na I. The column densities of the weaker C I components are relatively insensitive to
the choice of b. The derived component column densities for the ground and excited ﬁne-structure
states of C I are listed in Appendix Table 7; the line proﬁles for those adopted column densities
are shown as the smooth curves in Appendix Figures 7 through 13. The proﬁles computed for the
weaker λ1270 and λ1276 multiplets indicate that the ground state column densities for the main
components in each sight line cannot be much larger than the adopted values listed in Table 7 – so
that the excitation and thermal pressures estimated for those components (below) are unlikely to
be overestimated. The total Magellanic Clouds column densities for H, H2, C Itot, Na I, K I, and
CH are listed in Table 4.

2.5. C I f -values

JT11 found systematic diﬀerences between the f -values derived in their global analyses of
the C I multiplets seen in STIS spectra and the experimental or theoretical f -values reported in
the literature (e.g., Wiese et al. 1996; Morton 2003; Froese Fischer 2006) – with progressively
larger diﬀerences for the weaker multiplets. JT11 explored various possible explanations for the
diﬀerences – primarily related to possible saturation eﬀects for narrow, unresolved components –
but found no resolution. We have compared empirical curves of growth, derived from ﬁts to high-
resolution spectra of Na I and K I (Welty et al. 1994 and in preparation; Welty & Hobbs 2001),
with the equivalent widths of unblended C I, C I*, and C I** lines seen toward X Per, 23 Ori,
HD 62542, and ρ Oph A (Zsarg´o et al. 1997; Welty et al. 1999b and in preparation), for the
f -values listed in Morton (2003), Froese Fischer (2006), and JT11. While the stronger lines (with
the best-determined f -values) generally lie on the ﬂat part of the empirical curves of growth – so
that there is some uncertainty in matching the points to the curves – the comparisons generally
suggest that the f -values for the weaker lines are too low in Morton (2003) and Froese Fischer
(2006), but may be too high in JT11. The ”true” f -values for those weaker lines thus may lie
between the low and high values given in those references – consistent with hints from the slopes of
the relationships between the column densities of C Itot, Na I, and K I (discussed below). Accurate
experimental determinations of the f -values for those weak C I lines would be quite valuable.

While such f -value uncertainties obviously aﬀect the determination of C I column densities,
they can also aﬀect analyses of the excitation. For example, at relatively low thermal pressures
(as are common in the local Galactic ISM), the ground state populations are much higher than
those in the excited states, and the ground state lines in a given multiplet will be more subject
to saturation eﬀects than the corresponding excited state lines in that multiplet. In some cases,
the ground and excited state populations may best be determined from diﬀerent multiplets – but
only if the relative f -values are accurately known. Fortunately, the relative populations of the
C I excited states appear to be higher in the SMC and LMC (as discussed below) – reducing any
diﬀerential saturation eﬀects within each individual multiplet. The C I excitation derived for these
SMC and LMC sight lines thus will not be as sensitive to the choice of f -values as it might be for
local Galactic sight lines. We have adopted the JT11 f -values for this study of the SMC and LMC
– as that choice facilitates comparisons with the C I abundances and excitation that JT11 obtained
for Galactic sight lines.

2.6.

12C/13C ratio

In principle, contributions from the less abundant isotope 13C might aﬀect the proﬁles of
In the local Galactic ISM, the 12C/13C ratio is ∼ 70
the strongest C I velocity components.
(e.g., Sheﬀer et al. 2007; Ritchey et al. 2011; and references therein); the ratio is expected
to be somewhat higher for less evolved systems (e.g., Prantzos et al. 1996). Determination of

– 16 –

that ratio from diﬀerent molecular species (e.g., 12CO/13CO, 12CN/13CN) can be complicated by
fractionation eﬀects, however – depending on factors such as the energetics of the chemical reactions
involved in the creation and destruction of the isotopic variants and possible self-shielding against
photodissociation (for the more abundant variants). Because CH+ must be formed either non-
thermally or at relatively high temperatures, however, the 12CH+/13CH+ ratio should not be
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by fractionation – and so should provide good estimates for the 12C/13C ratio
(e.g., Ritchey et al. 2011). Examination of the available UVES spectra for several of the LMC
sight lines with detections of the strongest λ4232 line of CH+ (Welty et al. 2006) yields only upper
limits for N (13CH+), which imply corresponding 3σ lower limits on the 12C/13C ratio of about 4
(Sk−68 73), 10 (LH10-3061), and 20 (Sk−67 2). Observations of emission from a number of other
molecular species at mm wavelengths, in the N113 star-forming region and the N159 complex of
H II regions in the LMC (Johansson et al. 1994; Wang et al. 2009) and in the N27 compact H II
region in the SMC (Heikkil¨a et al. 1999), have suggested 12C/13C ratios of order 50.

For C I, the lines of 13C I are shifted by only about 0.65, −3.30, and −1.65 km s−1, relative to
those of 12C I, for the multiplets near 1656, 1560, and 1328 ˚A, respectively (Morton 2003); similar
data were not provided for other C I multiplets. While Carswell et al.
(2011) note a possible
detection of 13C I in a component of the z = 1.776 damped Lyα system toward the QSO 1331+170,
with 12C/13C ∼ 20, that weak contribution to the C I absorption had little eﬀect on the inferred
excitation of C I. If 12C/13C & 50 in the Magellanic Clouds, then 13C I would only be (barely)
detectable for the several strongest components in the seven sight lines considered in this study,
and it is unlikely that the derived relative level populations would be signiﬁcantly aﬀected.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Abundance and behavior of C I

In general, the abundances of trace neutral species X I should depend similarly on both the
overall strength of the UV radiation ﬁeld (responsible for photoionization) and the local temperature
and density (which aﬀect the corresponding radiative, dielectronic, and grain-assisted recombination
processes). Some diﬀerences may arise for individual clouds, however, due to diﬀerences in the
wavelength dependence of the photoionization cross sections (if the shape of the UV ﬁeld is very
diﬀerent) and/or in the depletion behavior of each element. Previous comparisons of the abundances
of Li I, C Itot, Na I, and K I in the Galactic ISM, for example, have found roughly linear relationships
between the column densities of those species (e.g., Jenkins & Shaya 1979; Welty & Hobbs 2001);
the shallower slopes for Fe I and Ca I (versus K I) can plausibly be attributed to the increasingly
severe depletion of iron and calcium in the higher column density sight lines (Welty et al. 2003).
The molecular species CH and H2 [for N (H2) & 1018 cm−2] should have similar dependences on
the UV ﬁeld (for photodissociation) and local density (for formation); their column densities also
exhibit roughly linear correlations with N (Na I) and N (K I) in the Galactic ISM (Welty & Hobbs

(C I values from this study). All others are Galactic, with most N (C Itot) values from Burgh et
al. (2010) or JT11; seven of the lowest N (C Itot) vs. N (Na I) are the Galactic values toward our
SMC and LMC targets. The large open star is for HD 62542, which has the largest N (C I) in our
Galactic sample. The solid lines represent the best weighted and unweighted ﬁts to the Galactic
points (not including the Sco-Oph and Trapezium sight lines). The trends with Na I, K I, and CH

2001; Welty et al. 2006).

Figure 3 revisits the relationships between N (C Itot) and the corresponding column densities
of Na I, K I, CH, H2, and Htot, for the Galactic sight lines included in the recent surveys of Burgh
et al. (2010) and JT11 (Appendix Table 8) and for the seven SMC and LMC sight lines examined
in this study (Table 4). The lower end of the relationship between N (C Itot) and N (Na I) is
largely deﬁned by the Galactic components seen toward our seven SMC and LMC stars – which
are quite consistent with an extrapolation of the trend seen at higher column densities in the C I
data from Burgh et al. (2010) and JT11 and with the values found for several lower column density
Galactic sight lines (Jenkins 2002; Meyer et al. 2012). As noted above, N (C Itot) is fairly tightly
correlated (r = 0.91–0.98) with N (Na I), N (K I), and N (CH) in the local Galactic ISM (Table 5).
Both considerations of ionization equilibrium and relative depletions (as noted above) and the
striking similarities in the observed absorption-line proﬁles of the three trace neutral species (in
many sight lines) suggest that those species track each other fairly well in the diﬀuse ISM – so
that the tight correlations among their column densities are not due just to the averaging of many
disparate components over long path lengths. The slopes of the relationships – ∼0.85–0.90 versus
N (Na I), N (K I), and N (CH), and ∼0.7 versus N (H2) – are somewhat smaller than those obtained
previously [e.g., ∼1.1–1.3 versus N (Na I) and N (K I); Welty & Hobbs 2001], however; see also the
comparisons shown in Liszt (2011). The shallower slopes found here likely reﬂect the use of the
JT11 C I f -values – as the higher N (C Itot) values generally are more dependent on observations
of the weaker C I lines, for which the JT11 f -values are progressively larger than those used in
previous studies. Unfortunately, there is very little overlap in sight lines between the recent surveys
and the earlier studies based on data from Copernicus and HST/GHRS (e.g., as collected in Wolﬁre
et al. 2008), and direct comparisons will depend on which C I lines were used in each case.

In the Galactic ISM, both N (Na I) and N (K I) exhibit nearly quadratic relationships with
N (Htot), consistent with considerations of ionization equilibrium (e.g., Welty & Hobbs 2001). In
Figure 3, the relationship between the Galactic N (C Itot) and N (Htot) is similar to those seen for
N (Na I) and N (K I), but (again) with slightly shallower slope (see also Burgh et al. 2010; Liszt
2011). The lower N (C Itot), relative to N (Htot), seen toward HD 147888 (in Sco-Oph) and toward
the Orion Trapezium region stars HD 37021 and HD 37061 is likely due to increased photoionization
of neutral carbon in the stronger-than-average radiation ﬁelds in those regions (consistent with
JT11’s analysis of the C I excitation) – as seen also for N (Na I) and N (K I) there (Welty & Hobbs
2001). The strong C I seen toward HD 62542, which at log N (C Itot) ∼ 15.4 lies slightly above
the mean trends in all ﬁve correlation plots, likely reﬂects the very steep far-UV extinction in that
sight line, which preferentially inhibits the photoionization of neutral carbon relative to that of
other trace neutral species with lower ionization potentials (Cardelli & Savage 1988; Welty et al.,
in preparation).

In the LMC and SMC, the characteristic sub-Solar metallicities, correspondingly lower dust-
to-gas ratios (compared to the local Galactic ISM), and typically somewhat enhanced UV radiation
ﬁelds all should contribute to lower abundances for the various trace neutral species, relative to

– 19 –

N (Htot). Those overall environmental factors are likely to have similar eﬀects on the abundances
of each trace species, however, so that their ratios [N (X I)/N (Y I)] might not diﬀer much from
the typical Galactic values. [The abundances of CH, H2, and the (unknown) carriers of the diﬀuse
interstellar bands appear to have a more complex behavior in the Magellanic Clouds – with de-
pendences on those global factors, on consequent diﬀerences in cloud structure, and also on local
physical conditions (Tumlinson et al. 2002; Cox et al. 2006, 2007; Cox & Spaans 2006; Welty et
al. 2006, 2012, 2013; van Loon et al. 2013; Bailey et al. 2015; see also Vos et al. 2011).]

The plots in Figure 3 indicate that our seven Magellanic Clouds sight lines do agree well with
the Galactic trends for N (C Itot) versus N (Na I) and N (CH), but that they fall slightly below the
Galactic trends for N (C Itot) versus N (K I) and N (H2).8 And, as has been noted for N (Na I),
N (K I), and the equivalent widths of some of the diﬀuse interstellar bands (Welty & Hobbs 2001;
Cox et al. 2006, 2007; Welty et al. 2006), N (C Itot) is generally much lower, relative to N (Htot),
in the LMC and (especially) the SMC than in the local Galactic ISM, by factors larger than
the diﬀerences in metallicity. [For comparison, N (Na I) (with a larger sample of measurements) is
typically lower by factors of order 30 and 100 in the LMC and SMC (respectively), compared to the
values obtained for Galactic sight lines with similar N (Htot) (Welty & Crowther, in preparation).]
The one (known) exception is the unusual SMC sight line toward Sk 143, where C I – like the other
trace neutral and molecular species – is more consistent with the Galactic relationships (Howk et
al. 2012; Welty et al. 2013). The slight general weakness of N (C Itot), relative to N (H2), in the
LMC and SMC may largely reﬂect the diﬀerences in metallicity. The more severe deﬁciencies of
all the trace neutral species, relative to N (Htot), in the Magellanic Clouds appear to be due to the
combined eﬀects of the lower metallicities, generally stronger radiation ﬁelds, and less grain-assisted
recombination (given the lower dust-to-gas ratios and likely smaller fraction of negatively charged
small grains) (Welty & Hobbs 2001; Welty & Crowther, in preparation; see also Weingartner &
Draine 2001; Liszt 2003). In addition, carbon appears to be less abundant than most other heavy
elements in the LMC and SMC, relative to Solar abundances, by factors of order 1.4–1.8 (Appendix
Table 9). For C I, with χion = 11.26 eV, however, the eﬀect of that slightly lower carbon abundance
may be oﬀset somewhat by the steeper far-UV extinction in some LMC and most SMC sight lines
(e.g., Gordon et al. 2003).

8N (K I) appears to be slightly less depressed (relative to the column densities of C I, Na I, H2, and Htot) in both
the Sco-Oph region and the Magellanic Clouds (Welty & Hobbs 2001; Welty & Crowther, in preparation) – but not
in the Trapezium region (so the diﬀerence for K I appears not to be an eﬀect of the strength of the ambient radiation
ﬁeld).

3.2. Excitation of C I

Table 6 lists the relative populations in the two excited C I ﬁne-structure levels, f1 = N (C I*)/N (C Itot)

and f2 = N (C I**)/N (C Itot), for individual components (or component groups) in our seven sight
lines that have well-determined column densities for both the ground and excited levels (from Ta-
ble 7). Figure 4 shows f2 versus f1 for those components, in comparison with the Galactic data
from JT11 (for narrow velocity intervals in their sight line sample) and with a theoretical curve
(very similar to those shown by JT11) giving the relative populations predicted for hydrogen den-
sities ranging from 0.01 to 105 cm−3, the average Galactic (WJ1) interstellar radiation ﬁeld (de
Boer et al. 1973), and a representative temperature of 80 K (Savage et al. 1977; Tumlinson et al.
2002; Welty et al. 2012).9 As discussed by JT11, the curves for higher or lower temperatures follow
similar trajectories to that for T = 80 K, with the points corresponding to a given thermal pressure
nHT located fairly close to each other (for nHT less than about 105 cm−3 K). Stronger radiation
ﬁelds shift the ”origin” of the curves (at the lowest densities) to higher f1 (and slightly higher f2);
see, e.g., Fig. 6 in Jenkins & Shaya (1979). The theoretical curve was generated with the code
used by Welty (2007), updated to use the more recent determinations of collisional excitation and
radiative decay rates employed by JT11. For T = 30, 80, and 300 K, the curves generated by this
code fall slightly below (and/or to the right of) the corresponding curves shown in Fig. 2 of JT11,
and the densities corresponding to a given point along each curve are slightly lower – by 0.18–0.22
dex for the slowly rising part of the curves at lower pressures (0.2 . f1 . 0.4) and by 0.10–0.18 dex
for the nearly vertical part of the curves at higher pressures (0.1 . f2 . 0.4).10 Those oﬀsets were
conﬁrmed by applying our iterative analysis (see below) to a small set of ”components” in JT11’s
Galactic sample, covering the ranges 30 . T . 110 K and 3.0 . log(p/k) . 4.4 (cm−3 K). In order
to facilitate comparisons with the results of JT11, the densities and pressures derived below are
adjusted for those oﬀsets.

Most of the points in JT11’s Galactic sample have f1 . 0.3 and f2 . 0.1, and the ”center of
mass” of all the Galactic points is at about (f1,f2) = (0.21,0.07) – slightly above the theoretical
curves for ”reasonable” temperatures for cold, neutral gas. The points falling above and to the left
of the theoretical curves are thought to be due to contributions from mixtures of low- and high-
pressure gas – dominated in most cases by the lower pressure gas. The four Galactic components
in Table 6 (those with v . 80 km s−1 toward the SMC or v . 100 km s−1 toward the LMC) have
relative ﬁne-structure populations quite consistent with the majority of those in that larger Galactic
sample. As might have been surmised by inspection of the line proﬁles (Appendix Figures 7 through

9In principle, the uncertainties on the column densities of the three ﬁne-structure levels yield a six-sided error box
in the (f1,f2) plane (e.g., Jenkins & Shaya 1979). The error bars in Fig. 4 give the approximate dimensions of those
error boxes – and make the plot slightly less complex.

10Roughly 0.06 dex of the diﬀerence may be due to our neglect of collisions with H2 (which should be reasonable
for most of the components in our small sample), whereas the curves in JT11 assume f (H2) = 0.6 (E. Jenkins 2015,
private communication).

and green circles, respectively) generally exhibit higher excitation – implying higher densities and
thermal pressures.

13), however, the SMC and LMC components exhibit systematically higher excitation than most
of the Galactic points – with f1 ≥ 0.3 and/or f2 ≥ 0.09 in all cases – indicating both systematically
higher densities (or thermal pressures) in those components and generally higher fractions of very
high pressure gas.
[The temperatures for interstellar clouds, as determined from H2, are similar
(on average) in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC (Tumlinson et al. 2002; Welty et al. 2012), so that
such comparisons can be made in terms of either density or thermal pressure.] While two of the
Magellanic Clouds points (Sk 13/v=147.6, Sk−68 73/v=296.4) are fairly close to the theoretical
curve (consistent with gas at a single pressure), most fall well above and to the left of the curve –
within the high-excitation tail of the Galactic distribution – suggesting that they represent mixtures
of gas at diﬀerent pressures.

3.3. Estimation of Thermal Pressures

The excitation of C I in a given sight line depends both on the temperature and density in
the gas and on the strength of the ambient UV radiation ﬁeld – though the eﬀects of the UV
ﬁeld are most signiﬁcant when the densities are relatively low. If the temperature and UV ﬁeld are
known, then values for the pressure/density and for the fractions of low- and high-pressure gas (glow
and ghigh, respectively) can be obtained by comparing the observed (f1,f2) with the appropriate
theoretical curve, with the additional assumption that the point representing (p/k)high is at (f1,f2)
= (0.38,0.49) (Fig. 4; as in JT11). For observed points falling on the theoretical curve, glow =
1.0, and (p/k)low (and thus the local density) can be read directly from the curve. For points in
the ”allowed” region above and to the left of the theoretical curve, the line between the assumed
high-pressure point and the observed point is extended downward to intersect with the equilibrium
curve (for the given T and UV ﬁeld) to obtain values for (p/k)low, and glow and ghigh are determined
from the relative distances between the observed point and the two endpoints (see Fig. 4 in JT11).

While the strength of the UV ﬁeld can be estimated for all seven of our SMC and LMC
sight lines from the excitation of H2 (e.g., Welty et al. 2006), those values depend on the column
densities in the J=4,5 rotational levels, which can be rather uncertain (e.g., Tumlinson et al.
2002). Following JT11, an iterative procedure was therefore employed to obtain estimates for both
the density (and thus the thermal pressure) and the strength of the UV ﬁeld from the observed
excitation of C I in each component, assuming that the temperature obtained from the populations
in the lowest two rotational levels of H2 characterizes the gas traced by C I (for all LMC or SMC
components in the sight line; 80 K was assumed for any Galactic components). In each iteration,
the density is ﬁrst estimated from the C I excitation (as just described), for a given UV ﬁeld
strength (represented as IUV times the ﬁducial WJ1 ﬁeld, with IUV initially set to 1.0). Next,
that density is used to obtain a new estimate for IUV from the ionization equilibrium of carbon,
using an estimate for the column density of singly ionized carbon in that component (column 4 of
Table 6) derived from observations of other little-depleted dominant ions (e.g., O I, P II, S II, and/or

– 25 –

Zn II) via ﬁts to lines from those species in the STIS spectra of our seven targets.11 Contributions
to the electron density from both photoionization of heavy elements and cosmic-ray ionization of
hydrogen, and both radiative and grain-assisted recombination (Weingartner & Draine 2001), are
included in the calculation of ionization equilibrium. The heavy element abundances, cosmic-ray
ionization rate, and grain-assisted recombination rates are scaled by factors of 0.5 and 0.2 for the
LMC and SMC, respectively, to account (approximately) for metallicity-related eﬀects.12 The new
value for IUV is then used to generate a revised theoretical curve for an updated determination of
the pressure/density. Convergence to a solution for the pressure/density and UV ﬁeld is generally
achieved within about 10–20 iterations. The ﬁnal pressure/density values are then adjusted for the
small oﬀsets found in comparisons with the results of JT11 (which also suggest that the derived glow
and IUV listed in Table 6 may be slightly underestimated). Inclusion of cosmic-ray ionization of H
signiﬁcantly increases the inferred electron densities and UV ﬁeld strengths, but has only a minor
eﬀect on the derived pressures/densities. Uncertainties in the ionization equilibrium calculations
(e.g., Weingartner & Draine 2001; Welty et al. 2003) – including those from the estimation of
N (C II) – and inclusion of dielectronic recombination (which may be signiﬁcant for C I at low
temperatures; Badnell 2006) would also aﬀect primarily the derived UV ﬁeld strengths, with little
impact on the derived pressures/densities.

As expected from the observed relative populations in the excited C I ﬁne structure states
(Fig. 4), the four Milky Way components included in Table 6 (toward Sk 18, Sk−68 73, and
Sk−70 115) all have thermal pressures similar to typical Galactic values (JT11) – with log(p/k)low
∼ 3.38–3.75 (cm−3 K) and glow ∼ 0.9–1.0; the corresponding local densities nH range from about 30
to 70 cm−3, for the assumed T = 80 K. The 12 SMC and LMC components in Table 6, however, tend
to be characterized by higher thermal pressures [log(p/k)low ∼ 3.56–5.11 (cm−3 K)] and/or higher
fractions of high-pressure gas (glow ∼ 0.5–1.0); the corresponding densities, for the low-pressure
component, range from about 55 to 2260 cm−3. The derived UV ﬁeld strengths are generally lower
(1 . IUV . 5) than those estimated from H2 excitation – particularly for Sk 13 and Sk 18 – and,
for these higher pressures, have relatively minor eﬀects on the excitation. These general results do
not appear to be biased by the requirement that all three ﬁne-structure levels be securely detected
in those components, as the SMC and LMC components in which the typically weaker lines from
C I** are not detected generally do exhibit higher N (C I*)/N (C I) ratios than the values found
for most of the ”components” in JT11’s Galactic sample – consistent with higher pressures and

11For the SMC components toward Sk 13 and Sk 143, estimates of N (C II) could not be obtained from ﬁts to lines
of other little-depleted species, due to a combination of spectral coverage, low S/N, and/or strongly saturated lines
for the available species. For the four components toward Sk 13, N (C II)/N (C I) = 103 was assumed – similar to the
values found for other SMC and LMC components (and for JT11’s Galactic sample) and consistent with the total
sight line N (C II) estimated from N (Htot) and a depletion of −0.2 dex. For the main component toward Sk 143,
log[N (C II)] = 16.32 (a factor ∼2 less than the value estimated for the total sight line) was assumed. As noted in
the text, the uncertainties in these N (C II) aﬀect primarily the derived IUV – but not the pressures/densities.

densities in the Magellanic Clouds. (Likewise, there is no apparent trend of higher excitation for the
higher column density components in JT11’s Galactic C I data.) Unfortunately, the upper limits
on N (C I**) in the lower column density SMC and LMC components generally cannot distinguish
between the typical Galactic and (higher) Magellanic Clouds pressures.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Thermal Pressures in the SMC and LMC

The values of (p/k)low and glow listed in Table 6 are not the ﬁrst indications of higher thermal
pressures for cool, predominantly neutral diﬀuse atomic and molecular clouds in the ISM of the
Magellanic Clouds:

• Observations of C I absorption in lower resolution spectra of SN 1987A (LMC), AV 95 (SMC),
and Sk−69 246 (LMC) had suggested somewhat higher population of the excited ﬁne-structure
levels there (Welty et al. 1999a; Andr´e et al. 2004) – but both the absolute column densities
and the distribution of the absorption among the various individual components in those sight
lines (unresolved in the UV spectra) are somewhat uncertain.

• Observations of H2 absorption toward SMC and LMC targets have revealed that the relative
populations in the higher H2 rotational levels (e.g., J=4,5) generally are higher in the Mag-
ellanic Clouds than in typical Galactic sight lines (Tumlinson et al. 2002; Andr´e et al. 2004;
Cartledge et al. 2005; Xue et al., in preparation). In principle, those levels can be populated
radiatively, collisionally (e.g., in shocks), or in H2 formation (e.g., Shull & Beckwith 1982). If
photon pumping is primarily responsible for populating the higher J levels (e.g., Jura 1974,
1975), then estimates for both the local hydrogen density nH and the strength of the ambient
UV radiation ﬁeld IUV may be obtained from expressions proportional to N (J=4,5); nH also
depends on the assumed rate coeﬃcient R for H2 formation (e.g., Lee et al. 2002; Welty et
al. 2006). As the temperatures derived for gas in the Magellanic Clouds (from the lowest two
H2 levels) are very similar to those found for the Galactic ISM, the higher J=4,5 populations
in the LMC and SMC suggest that both the density and the thermal pressure are generally
higher there. The uncertainties on N (J=4,5) can be large, however, as the lines from those
levels are often on the ﬂat part of the curve of growth (Tumlinson et al. 2002), and (again)
the multiple individual components present in most sight lines cannot be distinguished in
the lower-resolution FUSE spectra (Welty et al. 2006; Welty & Crowther, in preparation).
For the small sample in Table 6, the pressures estimated from H2 generally agree with those
determined from C I to within factors of about 2.5; the values inferred from H2 are much
higher toward Sk 13 and Sk 18, however.

• Analysis of the C2 rotational excitation in the sight line toward Sk 143 (SMC) has yielded
values for nH and p/k that are 2–4 times higher than those found in most Galactic sight lines

– 27 –

in which C2 is detected (Sonnentrucker et al. 2007; Welty et al. 2013 and in preparation).
The pressure inferred from C2 is slightly higher than the values obtained from C I and H2
(Table 6), consistent with C2 tracing somewhat denser gas. The densities and pressures
obtained from C2 scale with the strength of the radiation ﬁeld in the near-IR, however, which
is often not well constrained.

The pressures and densities inferred here from STIS echelle spectra of C I should be the most
reliable values currently available for cool, predominantly neutral diﬀuse gas in the Magellanic
Clouds – as they are based on the highest resolution UV spectra and are relatively insensitive to
both the typically rather uncertain radiation ﬁeld (in the UV and/or near-IR) and other assumed
parameters.

The higher thermal pressures found for cool, predominantly neutral gas in the Magellanic
Clouds are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of models for systems characterized by
lower metallicities (with correspondingly lower dust-to-gas ratios) and stronger UV ﬁelds (e.g.,
Wolﬁre et al. 1995). In lower metallicity systems, reduced cooling, due to lower abundances of the
usual gas-phase coolants, is at least initially balanced by lower photoelectric heating (less dust)
– as both processes scale (at least roughly) with the metallicity. When the photoelectric heating
becomes less than the heating from X-rays, however, the equilibrium temperature and pressure
required for stable cold, neutral clouds are increased. For metallicities 0.3 and 0.1 times Solar (and
dust-to-gas ratios correspondingly smaller than those in the local Galactic ISM), for example, the
models predict that the minimum pressures would be increased by factors of about 1.3 and 1.8,
respectively (Fig. 6b in Wolﬁre et al. 1995). Similarly, higher densities (and pressures) are required
for the gas-phase coolants to balance the increased heating in clouds subject to stronger ambient
radiation ﬁelds. For radiation ﬁelds enhanced by factors of 3, 10, and 100, the minimum pressures
would be increased by factors of about 2.2, 5.2, and 25, respectively (Fig. 7 in Wolﬁre et al. 1995).
While a dependence on metallicity might suggest that, on average, slightly higher pressures should
be found for the SMC, there is no obvious systematic diﬀerence between the pressures derived for
the LMC and SMC sight lines in this small sample; local environmental factors (including enhanced
radiation ﬁelds) may contribute to the higher pressures in speciﬁc cases.

In the Galactic ISM, higher thermal pressures do tend to be found where the UV radiation
ﬁeld is enhanced (e.g., Fig. 8 in JT11) – with perhaps a slightly steeper dependence than that
predicted by the models of Wolﬁre et al. (1995). In our Magellanic Clouds sample, some of the
lowest pressures [log(p/k)low ∼ 3.64–3.88 (cm−3 K)] – and some of the lowest fractions of very high
pressure gas – are found toward Sk−67 5, which also has fairly low values for IUV (∼ 1–3, as inferred
from both C I and the high-J H2 populations). On the other hand, the sight line toward Sk 143 has
even lower IUV, but both higher pressure [log(p/k)low ∼ 4.03 (cm−3 K)] and a higher fraction of
very high pressure gas. The sight line toward Sk 13 may have somewhat higher IUV (from H2) and
one component with high pressure, but also has several components with relatively low (p/k)low.
The sight line toward Sk 18 has the highest IUV from H2 (∼ 80), but not the highest pressure.
While there is thus no clear relationship between the pressure and the ambient UV radiation ﬁeld

– 28 –

in this small sample, the values for IUV, derived either from the higher-J H2 populations or from
carbon ionization equilibrium, can be rather uncertain (e.g., Tumlinson et al. 2002).

As all of our Magellanic Clouds targets are OB stars, all of the sight lines will contain at least
some ionized gas – which, in principle, might contribute to the observed abundances and excitation
of C I (Jenkins & Shaya 1979). Using ﬂuxes from model stellar atmospheres, Jenkins & Tripp
(2001) calculated that C I column densities up to about 3 × 1013 cm−2 might be seen from the H II
regions of Galactic OB stars. As noted in Table 2, Sk 143 (O9.7 Ib), Sk−67 5 (O9.7 Ib), Sk−68 73
(Of/WN), and Sk−70 115 (O6.5 Iaf) appear to be associated with distinct H II regions; Sk 13
(B2 Ia) and Sk 18 (O7 III) probably contribute to the ionization in the N19 complex; only Sk 155
(O9 Ib) appears to have no associated nebulosity (though some ionized gas is present). Absorption
from Al III, a tracer of ionized gas, is seen at velocities overlapping the main C I components (and
generally over a somewhat wider velocity range) in all seven sight lines. While strong absorption
from Si II* (which can be present in both neutral and ionized gas) is seen at the same velocities
as C I toward Sk 13 and Sk−68 73, fairly strong absorption from O I* and O I** (which trace
predominantly neutral gas) is also present – and the ratio N (O I*)/N (O I**), of order 1.4±0.2
toward Sk−68 73, implies that T . 330 K (e.g., Fig. 15 in JT11). Moderately strong Si II* and
weaker O I* are present toward Sk−70 115, but not at the velocity of the strongest C I; weaker
Si II* is seen toward Sk 18, Sk 143, Sk 155, and Sk−67 5. It thus seems unlikely that ionized regions
contribute signiﬁcantly to the C I observed in these LMC and SMC sight lines – or to the higher
thermal pressures derived from its excitation – especially given the much lower carbon abundances
in the Magellanic Clouds.

Some of the higher thermal pressures in these Magellanic Clouds sight lines, however, may be
related to energetic activity (e.g., due to stellar winds, star formation, and/or supernova remnants)
in the particular regions where the clouds are located. For example, the three sight lines in which
the highest thermal pressures are found all appear to probe complex regions containing both ionized
and molecular gas and showing indications of such energetic activity (see, e.g., the optical and near-
IR images for these sight lines presented on the FUSE Magellanic Clouds Legacy Project website;
Blair et al. 2009). Both Sk 13 and Sk 18 are located in the southwestern part of the SMC ”bar”,
in the N19 complex – which includes a number of H II regions and molecular clumps and several
supernova remnants, producing complex internal kinematics (e.g., Chu & Kennicutt 1988; Rubio
et al. 1993a; Rosado et al. 1994; Dickey et al. 2001); the values of log(p/k)low in the main
components in these two sight lines are 4.82 and 4.32 (cm−3 K), respectively. Even higher thermal
pressure [log(p/k)low ∼ 5.11 (cm−3 K)] is found for the main component toward Sk−68 73, located
in the central part of the LMC in the N44 complex – which also contains a number of ionized and
molecular regions and which shows evidence for fairly recent supernovae (e.g., Meaburn & Laspias
1991; Kim et al. 1998; Naz´e et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2011). Somewhat lower
thermal pressures [log(p/k)low ∼ 3.64–4.03 (cm−3 K)] are found for the simpler, more isolated, more
quiescent regions toward Sk−67 5 and Sk 143, and also toward Sk 155, where much of the gas seen
in absorption apparently is foreground to the ionized and molecular gas seen in emission (Welty

– 29 –

et al. 2012 and in preparation). Even those sight lines, however, exhibit higher thermal pressures
and/or higher fractions of very high pressure gas than those found in most Galactic sight lines in
the JT11 sample. The current sample of Magellanic Clouds sight lines is still very small, however,
and may not be entirely representative of those two lower metallicity galaxies.

4.2. C I in QSO Absorption-line Systems

These results regarding the abundance and excitation of C I in the LMC and SMC may also
inform our understanding of the C I absorption detected in some quasar absorption-line systems –
many of which are also characterized by sub-Solar metallicities. While most QSO absorbers appear
to be due to relatively warm, low density gas, with very low molecular fractions and fairly mild
depletions, the (relatively few) systems in which C I is detected generally contain colder, denser
gas, with higher dust and molecular content (e.g., Srianand et al. 2005; Ledoux et al. 2015). Most
of those systems are either conﬁrmed or likely damped Lyman-α systems [DLAs; with N (H) ≥ 2
× 1020 cm−2] or fairly strong sub-DLAs. Measurements of the excitation of C I in those systems
enable limits to be placed on both the local physical conditions in more distant galaxies and the
redshift dependence of the temperature of the CMB (e.g., Songaila et al. 1994; Ge et al. 1997;
Quast et al. 2002). Ledoux et al. (2015) have measured the equivalent widths of the λ1560 and
λ1656 C I multiplets for 66 systems found in a sample of low-resolution (R ∼ 2000) SDSS spectra
of 41,696 quasars – but higher resolution spectra will be needed to determine accurate column
densities and to assess the ﬁne-structure excitation in those systems. Moderately high resolution
spectra (mostly from Keck/HIRES and/or VLT/UVES) have yielded detections of C I in a smaller
number of systems, and ﬁts to the line proﬁles have yielded column densities for the ground and
excited ﬁne-structure states for the ”individual” components discernible in the spectra (Quast et
al. 2002; Srianand et al. 2005, 2008; Noterdaeme et al. 2007a, 2010, 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2010;
Carswell et al. 2011; Ma et al. 2015). Srianand et al. (2005) performed a simpliﬁed analysis of the
C I excitation for components in eight systems (considering only collisions with atomic hydrogen
and generally assuming T = 100 K) and found somewhat higher pressures than those typically
found in the local Galactic ISM. Jorgenson et al. (2010) used an approach more similar to that
employed by JT11 (assuming ionization equilibrium for carbon, but also solving for T ). For 11
components in six systems, Jorgenson et al. found median values for nH ∼ 70 cm−3, T ∼ 50 K,
and log(p/k) ∼ 3.86 (cm−3 K). That median pressure is nearly a factor of 2 higher than the JT11
Galactic ”center of mass” value and also is higher than the values estimated for those systems from
the excitation of C II. Jorgenson et al. concluded that the C I generally traces a cold, neutral
component in those systems, perhaps in denser clumps than the rest of the neutral material.

Figure 5 compares the column densities of C Itot with those of H2 and Htot, for QSO absorbers
(Appendix Table 10) and for sight lines in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds (from Tables 8
and 4). While the two sets of data are not precisely comparable, due to diﬀerences in the assumed
C I f -values (Sec. E), they are plotted together in order to compare general trends and scatter. In

Fig. 5.— Column density of C Itot versus column densities of H2 (upper left) and Htot (upper right)
and the corresponding ratios of those quantities versus the metallicity indicator [Zn/H] (lower left
, lower right), for QSO absorbers (stars) and for sight lines in the Milky Way (plain crosses) and
Magellanic Clouds. The solid lines in the upper panels are ﬁts to the Galactic data only, as in Fig. 3.
NOTE: The N (C Itot) values for the Galactic and Magellanic Clouds sight lines were obtained using
the f -values derived by JT11, while the values for the QSO absorbers were obtained using f -values
tabulated by Morton (2003) – so the two sets of data are NOT precisely comparable (see Sec. 2.5).
The two sets are plotted together here primarily to compare the QSO absorber values with trends
seen in the Galactic and Magellanic Clouds sight lines. Much of the scatter in the QSO absorber
values seen in the two upper panels may be due to diﬀerences in metallicity among the various
systems – as plots of the ratios in the lower two panels reveal similar, generally increasing trends
with [Zn/H] for the absorbers, the Magellanic Clouds, and our Galaxy.

line systems (blue stars), compared to Galactic values from JT11 (small black dots). The solid black
curve gives the theoretical populations for T = 80 K and the WJ1 radiation ﬁeld; the small circles
along the curve indicate steps in log(nH) of 0.1 dex; the larger open circles indicate log(nH) = 4.0,
3.0, 2.0, 1.0, etc. The lower solid blue curve gives the populations in equilibrium with the Cosmic
Microwave Background, for z = 0 to 5 – representing the minimum (f1,f2) that would be found for
a given z; the solid circles along the curve indicate z = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Some of the QSO absorber
components are consistent with the bulk of the Galactic sample, but most exhibit somewhat higher
excitation. As all the QSO absorbers here are at z < 3.1, the CMB generally plays a fairly minor
role in the excitation.

the two upper panels, there appears to be much more scatter in the QSO absorber values, so that
general trends – like those seen for the Galactic and Magellenic Clouds sight lines – are diﬃcult to
identify (see also Srianand et al. 2005). Much of that scatter, however, may be due to diﬀerences
in metallicity – as seen in comparisons of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds sight lines (Fig. 3); the
absorbers with higher (lower) N (C Itot), for a given N (H2) or N (Htot), tend also to be characterized
by higher (lower) metallicities (as estimated from [Zn/H]13). Some of the scatter could also be due
to diﬀerent amounts of warmer, more diﬀuse neutral gas – containing H but little C I – in the
diﬀerent systems. Moreover, a good correlation between N (C Itot) and N (H2) is not expected
for N (H2) . 1018 cm−2, where the H2 is not fully self-shielded; see, e.g., the analogous plots of
N (Na I) and N (K I) versus N (H2) in Welty & Hobbs (2001). Plots of the ratios N (C Itot)/N (H2)
and N (C Itot)/N (Htot) versus metallicity (the two lower panels in the ﬁgure) reveal similar trends
(higher ratios for higher metallicities) for the QSO absorbers, the Magellanic Clouds, and our
Galaxy [when the four absorbers with highest N (C Itot)/N (H2), which all have N (H2) < 1018 cm−2,
are removed]. For the QSO absorbers, the fairly steep relationship between N (C Itot)/N (Htot) and
metallicity (lower right) should be similar to the relationship between N (C Itot) and N (C II); the
slope (∼ 2) is then consistent with expectations from considerations of ionization equilibrium – just
as for N (C Itot), N (Na I), and N (K I) versus N (Htot) in the Galactic ISM (Sec. 3.1 above; Welty
& Hobbs 2001). Much of the remaining scatter in N (C Itot)/N (Htot), for a given [Zn/H], is likely
due to diﬀerences in the strength and shape of the local radiation ﬁeld (as modiﬁed by the UV
extinction) – as appears to be the case for the Galactic points at [Zn/H] = 0.0.

The top section of Appendix Table 10 lists both total C I column densities and the relative
populations of the excited levels (which should be less sensitive to diﬀerences in adopted f -values),
for 46 ”individual” components (in 19 systems) in which all three C I levels have been detected,
as well as system-wide values for the column densities of H, H2, and C Itot and the metallicity
indicator [Zn/H]. Those systems range in redshift from about 1.1 to 3.3, with total hydrogen
column densities from about 0.8 to 250 × 1020 cm−2, molecular fractions f (H2) from less than 0.01
to nearly 0.3, and metallicities (as gauged from [Zn/H]) from about −1.9 to +0.3 dex. Because
many of the QSO absorbers have metallicities well below Solar and relatively mild depletions of
refractory elements (e.g., from [Fe/Zn]), and because of the expected increase in TCMB at higher
redshifts, those absorbers should be characterized by somewhat higher thermal pressures – and
should exhibit corresponding higher excitation of C I – than those found for most clouds in the local
Galactic ISM (if the local radiation ﬁelds are comparable). Figure 6 compares the C I excitation
in those QSO absorber components with the Galactic values determined by JT11. As in Fig. 4,
the solid black line shows the relative populations predicted for T = 80 K, the standard Galactic
interstellar radiation ﬁeld, and densities ranging from 0.01 to 105 cm−3. The shorter solid blue line
shows the populations that would be obtained if the CMB were the only source of excitation, with
TCMB = 2.725 (1 + z) K, for redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 5 – i.e., giving the minimum (f1,f2) that would

13[Zn/H] = log[N (Zn II)/N (Htot)] − log(Zn/H)⊙, where the Solar zinc abundance log(Zn/H)⊙ = −7.37 dex

(Lodders 2003).

– 33 –

be found for each z (e.g., Fig. 12 in Jorgenson et al. 2010). While about one quarter of the QSO
absorber components exhibit excitation consistent with the bulk of the Galactic C I sample, the
rest have higher values for f1 (> 0.28) and (in many cases) for f2 (> 0.10). The majority of the
QSO absorber components thus do appear to be characterized by somewhat higher C I excitation
(and thus higher thermal pressures), as found for the main LMC and SMC components in our
small sample (Fig. 4, Table 6); similar results have been reported by Srianand et al. (2005) and
Jorgenson et al. (2010). The relative populations in the second excited state (C I**) are smaller,
on average, for the QSO absorbers than for the Magellanic Clouds sight lines, however, suggesting
that the fraction of gas at very high pressures may generally be smaller in the QSO absorbers.
There are no obvious trends of increasing f1 with either decreasing metallicity or increasing z, but
the sample is still very small. In most cases, the CMB does not dominate the excitation of C I,
as most of the components in Table 10 (as well as others in which C I** is not detected) have T01
(for C I) appreciably greater than TCMB(z), and as all the absorbers are at z <3.3 (for which the
predicted minimum f1 and f2 are low; see also Quast et al. 2002; Srianand et al. 2005; Jorgenson
et al. 2010). At z = 3, the calculations of Silva & Viegas (2002) indicate that the excitation to
C I* due to the CMB exceeds that due to collisions only for densities less than about 40 cm−3 (at
T = 100 K). In general, analysis of the ﬁne-structure excitation of C I can yield only upper limits
on TCMB(z) in quasar absorption-line systems.

5. SUMMARY / CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the abundance and ﬁne-structure excitation of C I for seven diverse sight
lines in the Magellanic Clouds, based on analyses of high-resolution UV spectra obtained with
HST/STIS. These are the only Magellanic Clouds sight lines for which high-resolution UV spectra
covering a number of C I multiplets have been obtained. Detailed ﬁts were made to the absorption-
line proﬁles of seven C I multiplets, guided by ﬁts to the corresponding proﬁles of the interstellar
Na I lines in higher resolution and/or higher S/N ratio optical spectra. The combination of high
spectral resolution (for both optical and UV data) and coverage of both weak and strong lines (for
both Na I and C I) enabled the determination of well constrained column densities for the ground
and excited ﬁne-structure states of C I in all seven sight lines.

Comparisons based on a new compilation of column densities of H, H2, Na I, K I, and CH,
for Galactic sight lines in the C I survey of JT11, indicate that the column density of C Itot is
well-correlated (r = 0.91–0.98) with the column densities of Na I, K I, and CH. The slopes of
those relationships, 0.85–0.90 in log-log plots, are smaller than those found previously, due to our
choice of C I f -values. N (C Itot) is somewhat less well correlated (r = 0.72–0.81) with the column
densities of H2 and total hydrogen Htot, likely due to variations in local environmental conditions
(e.g., the ambient UV radiation ﬁeld), which aﬀect the abundances of the trace neutral species. In
the LMC and SMC, N (C Itot) is consistent with the Galactic trends versus N (Na I) and N (CH),
but is slightly lower versus N (K I) and N (H2). Like N (Na I) and N (K I), N (C Itot) is generally

– 34 –

signiﬁcantly lower, for a given N (Htot), in the LMC and (especially) in the SMC – likely due to
the combined eﬀects of the lower metallicities, generally stronger radiation ﬁelds, and less grain-
assisted recombination there. Such metallicity-related eﬀects may account for a signiﬁcant part of
the scatter in plots of N (C Itot) versus N (H2) and N (Htot) for quasar absorption-line systems.

For individual LMC or SMC components with well determined column densities for all three
C I ﬁne-structure states, the implied thermal pressures are typically at least several times higher
than those found for most sight lines in the local Galactic ISM, and, in general, the fractions of gas
at very high pressures also are higher. The highest thermal pressures are found for complex regions
exhibiting increased activity (e.g., from supernova remnants, star formation, and/or stellar winds);
conversely, the lowest thermal pressures are found for simpler, more isolated and/or quiescent
regions. Even those lower thermal pressures are generally higher than typical Galactic values,
however. The higher thermal pressures in the LMC and SMC are consistent with predictions from
models of predominantly neutral clouds in systems with lower metallicities, lower dust-to-gas ratios,
and stronger UV radiation ﬁelds – where higher thermal pressures are needed to obtain stable cold,
neutral clouds. The similarly high C I excitation seen for a number of QSO absorption-line systems
(often with even lower metallicities) likely reﬂects varying combinations of those metallicity-related
eﬀects, local environmental conditions, and the higher temperature of the CMB at higher z. In
general, analysis of the C I ﬁne-structure excitation in quasar absorbers thus can yield only upper
limits on TCMB(z).

A. C I Spectra

Figures 7 through 13 show the STIS spectra of all six of the C I multiplets considered in
this study (Table 3), toward the seven Magellanic Clouds stars in our sample. The corresponding
higher resolution spectra of the Na I λ5895 and λ5889 lines are included at the top and bottom,
respectively, to show the detailed component structure derived for each sight line. The histograms
give the normalized observed spectra, while the smooth curves give the theoretical proﬁles com-
puted using the adopted component structures listed in Table 7 (in each case for the lines of the
given multiplet only), smoothed to the STIS echelle resolution (FWHM ∼ 2.7 km s−1). The tick
marks above the Na I proﬁles denote the detailed component structure; the lower and upper tick
marks above the C I proﬁles denote the locations of the strongest Galactic and Magellanic Clouds
components, respectively, for the ground and excited state lines of each multiplet (marked by o, *,

∗
and
∗ for the main SMC or LMC component). Absorption from the C I ground state at v < 80
km s−1 is from the Galactic disk and halo; absorption from gas at v > 80 km s−1 is from gas in
the SMC; the break point is assumed to be 100 km s−1 for the LMC sight lines.

B. Component Structures for Na I and C I

Table 7 lists the detailed component structures (N , b, v) derived from ﬁts to the high-resolution
CES spectra (FWHM ∼ 1.35–2.0 km s−1) of the Na I λ5895 and λ5889 lines, with the N further
constrained by ﬁts to the corresponding lower-resolution UVES spectra (FWHM ∼ 4.5–4.9 km s−1)
of both those lines and the weaker λ3302 doublet (see Welty et al. 2006 and Welty & Crowther, in
preparation). The b-values of the strongest Na I components were adjusted to yield consistent ﬁts
to both the weak and the strong Na I doublets. The b-values and the relative v were then ﬁxed for
ﬁts to the STIS spectra (FWHM ∼ 2.7 km s−1) of the six C I multiplets, with the b-values of the
strongest components increased slightly to yield consistent ﬁts to both the weakest and strongest
multiplets.

C. Galactic Column Densities

Comparisons of the column density of C Itot with the corresponding column densities of other
interstellar species can provide insights into both the behavior of C I and local physical conditions in
the ISM (e.g., Welty & Hobbs 2001). Unfortunately, data for the usual optical tracers of interstellar
material (Na I, K I, Ca I, Ca II, Ti II, CH, CH+, CN) have not been available (or else have not been
reported) for many of the sight lines analyzed by JT11. Moreover, the UV spectra of a number
of more commonly observed stars with previously reported N (C Itot) (e.g., Jenkins & Shaya 1979;
Jenkins et al. 1983; Wolﬁre et al. 2008) – which often do have data for the optical tracers – have
not been re-analyzed using the f -values adopted by JT11. We have therefore sought to augment the
existing column density data for other species in the JT11 sight line sample by analyzing any existing

– 43 –

optical spectra (from the ESO public archive and/or from an archive of spectra obtained for studies
of the diﬀuse interstellar bands14) and by obtaining new optical spectra with Magellan/MIKE.
Because high-resolution spectra suitable for detailed proﬁle ﬁts are not available in most cases,
the column densities generally were obtained from the equivalent widths and/or AOD integrations
of relatively weak lines in the spectra (e.g., . 15 m˚A for CH). For Na I, all the column density
values greater than 6 × 1013 cm−2 were derived from observations of the weaker λ3302 doublet
(”U” lines) – so that saturation should not be an issue for those highest values. Lower limits to the
column densities are given where no suﬃciently weak lines are available. We have also derived some
new atomic hydrogen column densities from the (damped) Lyman-α absorption seen in the same
UV spectra analyzed by JT11, using the usual continuum reconstruction method. The currently
available column density data for H, H2, Na I, K I, and CH for the JT11 sight line sample are listed
in Table 8.

D. Carbon Reference Abundances

Table 9 lists values of the carbon abundance derived from diﬀerent kinds of objects in the
LMC and SMC, obtained from the literature. Estimates of the Solar carbon abundance appear to
have stabilized at a value of about 8.40 dex, on the usual logarithmic scale in which the hydrogen
abundance is 12.0 (Lodders 2003; Asplund et al. 2009), and most of the LMC and SMC values for
each object type also are in reasonable agreement, given the diﬀerences in samples and methodology
and the typical uncertainties. The values derived from later-type giants and supergiants may be
slightly higher than those obtained from H II regions and earlier-type stars, however. Our adopted
values – 7.95 dex for the LMC and 7.45 dex for the SMC – are consistent with several other recent
estimates also based on values compiled from studies of diﬀerent kinds of objects (e.g., Hunter et
al. 2007; Salmon et al. 2012; Tchernyshyov et al. 2015). Those adopted values are about 0.2 dex
lower, relative to Solar abundances, than the values obtained for most heavier elements – which
are typically about −0.3 dex for the LMC and about −0.7 dex for the SMC (largely from the
same references). While the depletion of carbon in the ISM of the Magellanic Clouds is currently
unknown, it is unlikely to be more severe than the roughly −0.2 dex found for the local Galactic
ISM (e.g., Jenkins 2009).

E. C I in QSO Absorption-line Systems

Table 10 lists the column densities of C I in QSO absorption-line systems that are used in
Figures 5 and 6. The top section of the table lists systems for which all three ﬁne-structure states

14The ESO public archive (at archive.eso.org) contains spectra from FEROS, HARPS, and UVES. The DIB
database (at dib.uchicago.edu/public) contains spectra obtained with the ARC echelle spectrograph (e.g., Friedman
et al. 2011).

have been detected (Quast et al. 2002; Srianand et al. 2005, 2008; Noterdaeme et al. 2007,
2010, 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2010; Carswell et al. 2011; Guimar˜aes et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2015).
The bottom section lists systems for which only total C I column densities are available; in some
cases, the values are for just the ground ﬁne-structure state. In most of the upper systems, the
values are for ”individual” components determined in ﬁts to the absorption-line proﬁles seen in
moderately high resolution spectra (FWHM generally > 5 km s−1) obtained with Keck/HIRES
and/or VLT/UVES. Those references used f -values from Morton (2003) (or similar values from
earlier work), so that the absolute column densities are not directly comparable to those in the JT11
sample. Many of the values were derived primarily from observations of the stronger C I multiplets,
however, for which the diﬀerences in f are relatively small (less than a factor of 2). In many cases,
the inferred C I column densities are not extremely high, so the relative level populations f1 and
f2 may be reasonably well determined. We note, however, that some of the b-values are either
very low or very high, in comparison with those derived from higher resolution spectra of C I
and other trace neutral species in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds – which will aﬀect
the derived column densities. (And, for cases with very low b-values, use of the JT11 f -values
would yield both somewhat larger b and lower column densities.) Some of the points are located
(nominally) outside the ”allowed” region bounded on the left by the line between the minimum
(f1,f2) [set by T (CMB)] and the ”inﬁnite density” point [(0.33,0.56), set by the degeneracies of the
ﬁne-structure levels], and on the right by the range of theoretical curves for ”reasonable” T . The
column densities of H, H2, and the ﬁrst C Itot refer to the entire system, and the derived quantities
f (H2) and [Zn/H] are average values which may not reﬂect the actual conditions in some of the
individual components. For systems where N (Zn II) has not been measured, the [Zn/H] values (in
parentheses) are metallicities estimated from O I, Si II, and/or S II (from the original references).
Systems in the bottom section of the table taken from Srianand et al. (2005) generally do not
exhibit detectable H2 absorption; most of those systems also are characterized by metallicities less
than 0.05 × Solar. The two columns following the fractional populations (f1 and f2) give the
excitation temperatures for C I N (0)/N (1) – as expected from the Cosmic Microwave Background
at the redshift of the absorber and as derived from the ﬁtted column densities.

Note. — Column densities (cm−2) are logarithmic. Limits are 3 σ. The values for N (H), N (H2), f (H2), the ﬁrst N (C Itot),
and [Zn/H] are for the entire system; the values for the second N (C Itot), f1, and f2 are for the components (or component
groups) at redshift zabs within each system. Systems in the lower part of the table do not have complete information on the
excitation of C I – so only the total column density is given. Metallicities given in parentheses were estimated from the column
densities of O I, Si II, and/or S II (in the original references). The values for N (C Itot) in this table were not obtained using
the f -values from JT11, and so are not directly comparable to the values for Galactic and Magellanic Clouds sight lines given
elsewhere in this paper.
