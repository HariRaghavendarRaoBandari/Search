Abstract
We measured the K-series X-rays of the K− p exotic atom in the SIDDHARTA experiment with a gaseous hydrogen target of 1.3
g/l, which is about 15 times the ρSTP of hydrogen gas. At this density, the absolute yields of kaonic X-rays, when a negatively
charged kaon stopped inside the target, were determined to be 0.012+0.004
−0.011 for all the K-series transitions Ktot.
These results, together with the KEK E228 experiment results, conﬁrm for the ﬁrst time a target density dependence of the yield
predicted by the cascade models, and provide valuable information to reﬁne the parameters used in the cascade models for the
kaonic atoms.

1. Introduction

The measurements of the K-series X-rays of kaonic hydrogen K− p and kaonic deuterium K−d atoms give uniquely
the isospin dependent antikaon-nucleon s-wave scattering lengths a0 (I = 0) and a1 (I = 1). Extracted from the energy

spectra, the strong interaction induced energy shifts 1s and widths Γ1s of the ground states of these kaonic atoms are
connected to the s-wave scattering lengths via Deser-type formulae [1, 2]. The SIDDHARTA collaboration succeeded
in giving a precise evaluation of aK− p( = 1
2[a0 + a1]) [3], and is preparing to perform the ﬁrst precision measurement
of the K−d X-rays, to determine the isospin components a0 and a1 by extracting aK−d.
Moreover, a new result on the yield of K− p K-series X-rays is essential to improve the cascade model calculation
of the kaonic hydrogen, which is the most poorly understood among all the hydrogen-like exotic x− p atoms, where
= 0.015 ± 0.005
x− represents ¯p, µ−, π−, or K−. Up to now only the KEK-PS E228 (K pX) experiment obtained YKα
and a Kα to Ktot ratio of 0.27 for a 10 ρSTP hydrogen gas target [4, 5]. The spectra from three earlier experiments
[6, 7, 8] where a liquid target was used, were ambiguous and did not allow a reliable subtraction of the number of
X-ray events. The K− p and K−d K-series X-rays are diﬃcult to measure, ﬁrstly due to their small yields, mainly as
a result of the Stark mixing of the high-lying atomic states, that causes the K− to be absorbed by the nucleus from
excited states, reducing the rate of the transitions to the ground state. A second reason is the large natural width of
the 1s states, which makes a high signal to background ratio hard to achieve. For K− p, results of experiments indicate
a 1s width of ∼500 eV [3, 4, 5, 9]; for K−d, only theoretical predictions exist, which range from 650 eV to 1000 eV
[10, 11, 12].

In this paper, we present the SIDDHARTA experimental result on the kaonic hydrogen K-series X-ray yield,
which together with the K pX result, conﬁrms a density dependence as predicted by multiple cascade calculations
[13, 14, 15, 16]. The new data will contribute to tuning the parameters including the 2p strong-interaction induced
width, which is used in the latest kaonic hydrogen cascade models as the only free input parameter [15, 16, 17].

2. The SIDDHARTA experiment

The SIDDHARTA experiment was performed at the DAΦNE electron-positron collider, where the energies of the
beams were tuned to 510 MeV to produce the φ(1020) meson almost at rest in the laboratory frame. The negatively
charged kaons from the φ → K+K− decay mode have a low kinetic energy of ∼ 16 MeV and a small momentum bite,
being ideal to be stopped in gas state targets. The hadronic background at DAΦNE is substantially lower compared
to the hadronic beam lines. The main component of the DAΦNE background originating from the beam-beam and
beam-gas interactions is composed of minimum ionizing particles (MIPs), which can be separated from the slow K−
by using the time of ﬂight information.

As kaon detectors, we used two slices of 1.45 mm thick plastic scintillators placed about 6 cm above and below
the interaction point (IP), as shown in Fig. 1. The kaon trigger is deﬁned by the coincidence between the two
kaon detectors, which gives an identiﬁcation of the K+K− with an almost back-to-back orientation. A clear separation
between the kaons and the MIPs was achieved, as presented in previous publications of the SIDDHARTA collaboration
[3, 18, 19].

Due to the crossing angle of 50 mrad between the two beams, the φ meson has a boost towards the center of the
accelerator rings. To obtain a uniform momentum distribution for the kaons entering the target volume, we optimized a
mylar degrader to a steps-shape which is thicker towards the center of the accelerator rings [19]. After passing through
the degrader, the kaons enter the vacuum chamber, which contains the target cell and the 144 silicon drift detectors
(SDDs), each with an eﬀective area of 1 cm2. The stopped K−’s form kaonic atoms in highly excited states, and the
subsequent X-rays from the de-excitations are detected by the SDDs with a sub-microsecond timing capability. We
used the time diﬀerence between the SDD events and the kaon trigger to distinguish the kaonic X-rays from the beam
originating background. Multiple foils of copper and titanium were placed inside the setup for the energy calibration
of the SDDs. These foils are irradiated with an X-ray tube from below the setup every few hours in between the
measurements with beam.
For the K− p measurement, the cylindrical target cell was ﬁlled to 0.13 MPa with hydrogen gas, and cooled down
to 23 K. The DAΦNE collider delivered a total amount of beam corresponding to 340 pb−1 integrated luminosity, out
of which during the last 106 pb−1 of the beam time the experimental setup and the DAΦNE accelerator were operating
under stable conditions. Moreover, the conﬁgurations of the degrader, the target, and the kaon detector were ﬁnalized
and ﬁxed during this last part of beam time, after a series of modiﬁcations during the ﬁrst part to optimize the signal to
background ratio. To extract the yields of the kaonic hydrogen K-series transitions, we selected the data corresponding
to these last 106 pb−1 to determine a well-deﬁned systematic error in the comparison to the Monte Carlo simulation.

This data selection criterion is diﬀerent from, but in no conﬂict with, the previous SIDDHARTA publication [3] in
which the complete data set of 340 pb−1 was used in order to achieve the best precision in the strong interaction shift
and width of kaonic hydrogen 1s state. For the data set used in this paper, the target density was 1.3 ± 0.1 g/l, which
is about 15 times ρSTP (the standard density of hydrogen gas at 0 ◦C and 1 atm).

3. The absolute yield of K− p X-rays

To determine the absolute yield Y of the K-series X-rays of the kaonic hydrogen, we ﬁrst determined the detection
eﬃciency of the kaonic X-rays EXP from the data, by normalizing the number of detected X-ray events NX-ray with
the number of kaon triggers Nktrg. From the Monte Carlo simulation with the Geant4 toolkit [20], we evaluated the
MC, given by the number of detected X-ray events NMC
ktrg in the simulation,
assuming each stopped K− leads to a subsequent kaonic X-ray event. The comparison between the two eﬃciencies
gives the absolute yield as :

The energy calibration for each individual SDD was performed using the ﬂuorescence lines of Ti and Cu, following
the same routine introduced in [3, 18]. From the data corresponding to 97 SDDs which were operating stably with
good energy resolution, we selected the events that have a timing coincidence with the kaon trigger as Fig. 2 shows,
and obtained the kaonic hydrogen spectrum shown in Fig. 3. To determine the background of other kaonic X-rays
when the K− stopped inside the target gas container made of Kapton polyimide (C22H10N2O5), the energy spectrum
from the deuterium target exploratory measurement for 100 pb−1 of beam time was included in the analysis, as shown
in Fig. 3.

Figure 3. Simultaneous ﬁt result of the hydrogen and deuterium targets data.

In the analysis we ﬁtted the two spectra simultaneously with a global ﬁt function, using the same parameters for
the shape of the continuous background over the full energy range, and for the relative intensities among the kaonic X-
rays from K− stops inside the materials other than the gas volume. The parameters for the energy dependent detector
resolution are also universal for both spectra. Each transition line of the kaonic atom X-rays from K− stops in the
Kapton or aluminum in the setup is represented by a Gauss function, and the kaonic hydrogen and deuterium lines are
represented as the convolution of a Lorentz function and a Gauss function. The Lorentzian width corresponds to the
width of 1s state and the Gaussian width represents the detector energy resolution at the mean value of the Lorentz
function.

To determine the number of kaonic hydrogen X-rays, the energy range for the ﬁt was chosen to be from 4 keV to
11 keV, which covers all the kaonic hydrogen K-series lines, whose expected transition energies considering only the
electromagnetic interaction are listed in Table 1. In Fig. 3, the ﬁt result shows a distinguishable Kα line and a structure
called Kcomplex which includes all the transitions to 1s from 3d and higher energy levels. Since the individual lines
overlap, the relative intensities can not be uniquely assigned. To handle the uncertainty among the relative intensities
of the Kcomplex lines, an iterative ﬁt procedure was applied in the same way as introduced in [3]. In the last step of the
ﬁt, the 1s shift and width, and the relative intensities of the higher transitions compared to the intensity of K− p Kα are
all free parameters, with the set values given by the results from the last step in the iteration. For kaonic deuterium,
the Kα and Kβ lines are included in the ﬁt, with the 1s shift and width ﬁxed to be 500 eV and 1000 eV without losing
generality and with their intensities as free parameters.
As a quality check of the current analysis, the simultaneous ﬁt determines the 1s state shift and width of kaonic
hydrogen of the selected data set to be (only statistical errors): 1s = −273± 47(stat) eV, and Γ1s = 567± 103(stat) eV,
which are in good agreement with the published results of the SIDDHARTA collaboration using 340 pb−1 of hydrogen
target data [3]: 1s = −283 ± 36(stat) ±6(syst) eV and Γ1s = 541 ± 89(stat) ±22(syst) eV.
The number of Kα events and its statistical error in the K− p spectrum are directly obtained from the results of the
ﬁt, which are listed in Table 2. To evaluate the error for the number of Ktot, however, the large statistical errors of other

transitions as a result of the correlation among their relative intensities must be considered. This error assignment was
done by making use of the covariance matrix associated with the vector of the ﬁt parameters. This matrix is given
by the Minuit processor MINOS when the minimization of the global Chi-square function is achieved [23]. More
speciﬁcally, when we subtracted the parameters that characterize the signal function of the kaonic hydrogen X-rays,
and integrated over the region of interest to get the number of events, the statistical error for the value of the ﬁt
function at each energy bin was evaluated using the signal parameter-vector’s covariance matrix, whose oﬀ-diagonal
components preserve the correlations among the parameters. Details of this application in the analysis are discussed in
[24]. To apply this method, all the parameters in the ﬁnal ﬁt must be free in order to obtain the covariance matrix. Thus
in the analysis we did not refer to the predictions from any cascade calculations to constrain the relative intensities of
the lines in the Kcomplex. The eﬀectiveness of this method is demonstrated in Table 2, in the sense that the statistical
error of the total number of events is not aﬀected by the large uncertainties of the individual Kcomplex lines, after the
correlations are taken into account.

Another correction to the number of Kα and Ktot events was done by taking into account that, when we applied
the events selection based on the SDD timing spectrum in Fig. 2, we estimated that the selected region includes about
84% of the total kaon originating events, indicated by the ratio between the grey area and the whole area of the Vavilov
function that eﬀectively represented the coincidence events. As a result, for Nktrg = (1.09±0.10)×107 kaon triggers in
= 3137 ± 501.
this data set, the number of kaonic hydrogen X-ray events we obtained are: NKα
Using the same method with which NKtot is evaluated and applying the same correction for the timing selection, the
numbers of Kcomplex events is estimated to be NKcomplex

= 835 ± 170 and NKtot

= 2334 ± 508.

3.2. Monte Carlo simulation for MC

A Monte Carlo simulation using the GEANT4 toolkit version 4.9.4 was done to evaluate the X-ray detection
eﬃciency MC. Since in the experiment the positions where the kaons stop are not monitored, we combined the
simulation for the stopping positions of the kaons and the simulation for the X-ray detection eﬃciency of SDDs. This
was realized in the form of a user deﬁned routine in the physics processes for K−-at-rest, by generating at the exact
position where the K− stops an isotropically oriented outgoing photon. In this way the ratio between NX-ray and Nktrg
from the simulation is comparable to the value derived from the experiment.

In the previous publications of the SIDDHARTA collaboration, the proﬁle of the materials that the kaons pass
through from DAΦNE IP until stopping inside the gas volume is listed in detail in [25], and an exhaustive description
of the implementation of the physics processes in the simulation was given in [19].

We initiated the simulation from the generation of the kaon pairs at the DAΦNE IP, with the initial positions
smeared according to the ﬁnite dimension of the crossing region of the beams. Also we considered the momentum
boost due to the beam crossing angle, and the angular distribution of the kaons as a result of a spin-one particle
decaying into two spin-zero particles. The number of events with energy deposit of a few MeV at both kaon detectors
corresponds to the number of kaon triggers NMC
ktrg.

Consequently, by looking at the energy deposited in the same 97 SDDs as used in the data analysis, we counted the
ktrg, we obtained the detection eﬃciency

from the Monte Carlo simulation MC. Over the region of interest from 4 keV to 11 keV, we checked the energy
dependence of the eﬃciency, based on a series of simulation runs with diﬀerent energies for the photons generated
when the K− stops inside the gas volume. The photon energy was smeared with a Lorentz function (550 eV width)
to reproduce the width of the kaonic hydrogen lines, and a Gauss function (60 eV sigma) to reproduce the detector
resolution. The results are plotted in Fig. 4, where the curve is a ﬁt to a second order polynomial function. For the
center value of Kα near 6.2 keV, the eﬃciencies when the mylar degrader thickness was varied by ± 50 µm (which is
the uncertainty of our optimization), are plotted in square dots.

The vertical dashed lines in Fig. 4 mark the energy boundaries of the Kα, Kcomplex, and Ktot, used to assign
their systematic errors of the eﬃciency by making projections onto the ﬁtted curve. For the Kα line, which has
a distinguishable structure in the energy spectrum, the MC is given by the simulation run with the photon energy
centered at 6.198 keV, which is the value taken from the SIDDHARTA result [3]. The boundaries for Kα were chosen
as ± 600 eV from the center energy, since they coincide both with the results of experiments for the 1s width of about
550 eV, and with the energy diﬀerence between Kα and Kβ as shown in Table 1. For the Kcomplex and Ktot, the mean
values for the MC were chosen, without losing generality, as the average of the vertical arrowed segments marked in
Fig. 4, which are 0.0067 for Ktot and 0.0072 for Kcomplex, with the corresponding systematic errors ± 13% and ± 5%.
The systematic error of the Ktot is noticeably larger, due to a wider energy range.
Other factors that contributed to the ﬁnal error in the eﬃciency from the simulation include: the uncertainty of the
target height (± 2%), the uncertainty of the gas density (± 2%) [24], and the statistical error (± 2%). These errors are
added quadratically to the contributions from the degrader thickness uncertainty (+9%−17%) and the energy dependence of
the eﬃciency.

intensities of the overlapping K-complex transitions is evaluated statistically in the analysis, without any reference to
cascade calculations.

Our results, together with the absolute yield of Kα and the Kα/Ktot ratio given by the K pX experiment, conﬁrms
the density dependence for the gas density regime predicted by many cascade calculations. We take as an example the
recent Extended Standard Cascade Model (ESCM) from [15, 16] in Fig. 5, plotted with the results of the K pX and
SIDDHARTA experiments. In this model the broadening eﬀect of the 2p state due to the strong interaction Γhad
2p is the
only parameter to be tuned. By evaluating the kinematics of the captured kaon at the early stage of the cascade with a
classical trajectory Monte Carlo method, the Stark eﬀect and the initial kinetic energy of the kaon in the atomic orbit,
which are introduced as free parameters in the early cascade models [26, 27], are quantitatively estimated [17]. The
X-ray yields have been calculated with the ESCM for muonic, pionic, and antiprotonic hydrogen/deuterium atoms,
and agreements to the experiment data over a wide range of target density were veriﬁed by Jensen and others [16].
We can expect that a comparison between experiment and cascade calculation results for Y(Ktot) / Y(Kα) and Y(Kα)
simultaneously may give an estimation of Γhad
2p , as discussed by Jensen [16]. An improved cascade model will give
a more accurate estimate of the K−d X-ray yields, which is crucial in planning the beamtime and to optimize the
experiment setup of the SIDDHARTA-2 experiment [28].

As a ﬁnal remark, for the discussion about the ratios among the yields, we propose to use the absolute yield of
the Kcomplex instead of Ktot from the experimental point of view, because the error for Y(Kcomplex) / Y(Kα) can be
quantitatively assigned, thanks to a distinguishable Kα line from other transition lines.
