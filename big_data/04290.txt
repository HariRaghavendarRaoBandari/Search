Abstract—Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been
recognized as a promising technique for providing high data rates
in 5G systems. This letter is to study physical layer security in a
single-input single-output (SISO) NOMA system consisting of a
transmitter, multiple legitimate users and an eavesdropper. The
aim of this letter is to maximize the secrecy sum rate (SSR)
of the NOMA system subject to the users’ quality of service
(QoS) requirements. We ﬁrstly identify the feasible region of
the transmit power for satisfying all users’ QoS requirements.
Then we derive the closed-form expression of an optimal power
allocation policy that maximizes the SSR. Numerical results are
provided to show a signiﬁcant SSR improvement by NOMA
compared with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA).

I. INTRODUCTION

NOMA has been recognized as a promising band efﬁcient
candidate for 5G wireless systems [1]. Different from conven-
tional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) such as time-division
multiple access (TDMA), NOMA exploits the power domain
to serve multiple users simultaneously. Early work on NOMA
has mainly focused on the enhancement of spectral efﬁciency.
In [2], [3], different cooperative NOMA schemes have been
investigated, respectively, for improving transmission relia-
bility. In [4], resource allocation has been considered in a
relaying system using the NOMA principle. In [5], multiple-
antenna technologies have been used to further improve the
performance of NOMA systems.

Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications,
information exchange between transceivers is vulnerable to
eavesdropping, which poses a challenge to realize secure
wireless transmission. Recently, physical layer security, which
achieves secure transmissions by exploiting the dynamics in
the physical layer, has drawn considerable attention [6], [7].
Naturally, this new concept of security can be applied to
NOMA in order to realize robust secure transmission.

In this letter, we investigate the maximization of the secrecy
sum rate (SSR) of a SISO NOMA system, where each user has
a predeﬁned quality of service (QoS) requirement. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst effort to study physical layer
security in NOMA. We ﬁrstly identify the feasible region of
the transmit power for satisfying all users’ QoS requirements.
Then we derive the closed-form expression of an optimal
power allocation policy that maximizes the SSR. Numerical
results are provided to show a signiﬁcant SSR improvement
by NOMA compared with conventional orthogonal multiple
access (OMA).

II. SYSTEM MODEL

2

Consider a downlink system consisting of a transmitter, M
legitimate users and a passive eavesdropper. Each node in
the system is equipped with a single antenna. The channel
gain from the transmitter to the m-th user is denoted by
− α
m gm, where gm is the Rayleigh fading channel
hm = d
gain, dm is the distance between the m-th user and the
transmitter, and α is the path loss exponent. Similarly, the
channel gain from the transmitter to the eavesdropper is
− α
modeled as he = d
ge. The instantaneous channel state
e
information (CSI) of each user is known at the transmitter
while that of the eavesdropper is unknown. Without loss of
generality, the channel gains can be sorted as 0 < |h1|2 ≤
|h2|2 ≤ ...|hMe|2 ≤ |he|2 < |hMe+1|2 ... ≤ |hM|2, where
Me denotes the number of the legitimate users whose channel
gains are not greater than that of the eavesdropper. It should be
pointed out that the transmitter neither knows |he|2 nor Me.
the transmitter
broadcasts a linear combination of M signals to its users.
The transmitted superposition signal can be expressed as
m=1 √γmP sm, where sm is the message for the m-th user,
PM
P denotes the total transmit power, and γm represents the
power allocation coefﬁcient, i.e., it is the ratio of the transmit
power for the m-th user’s signal to the total transmit power P .
Each user has a predeﬁned QoS requirement, which demands
the transmitter to send the message to each user with a
minimum data rate, respectively. Meanwhile, the eavesdropper
tries to intercept all legitimate users’ messages1.

Employing the NOMA scheme [1], [8],

A. Achievable Rates of Legitimate Users

The users apply the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) to decode their own signals: the m-th user will ﬁrst
detect the i-th user’s message, i < m, and then eliminate this

1The eavesdropper may be interested only in a speciﬁc user’s message. But
in this work, we make a more conservative assumption that the eavesdropper
intercepts each user’s message, because the transmitter neither knows which
user the eavesdropper wants to wiretap nor the eavesdropper’s CSI.

message from its observed mixture, in a successive way. The
i-th user’s message, i > m, will be treated as noise. Thus, the
achievable rate of the m-th user, 1 ≤ m ≤ M , is given by [8]

We denote Rm

s and Rs represent
the secrecy rate of the m-th user and the SSR, respectively.
In this work, we make a pessimistic assumption that the ﬁrst
m − 1 users’ messages have already been decoded before the
eavesdropper tries to decode the m-th user’s message, which
overestimates the eavesdropper’s capability. Thereby, Rs given
below serves as a lower bound on the SSR correspondingly.

III. SECRECY SUM RATE MAXIMIZATION

In this section, we propose a power allocation policy to
maximize the SSR of the system subject to all users’ QoS

m=1, which
the optimal power allocation coefﬁcients {γ
maximize the SSR, are derived analytically.

We denote Qm as the minimum data rate required by the

Due to the QoS requirements, there must exist a minimum
transmit power, denoted by Pmin, that satisﬁes all users’ QoS
requirements. Then problem (6) is feasible only when P ≥
Pmin. As a result, it is important to identify the feasible region
of the transmit power before dealing with problem (6).

2Particularly, in the considered problem, the secure transmission for the
m-th user, 1 ≤ m ≤ Me, should be guaranteed by using conventional
cryptography implemented at upper layers.

Theorem 1: The objective function in (7a) is minimized

when all the constraints in (7b) are active.

Proof: We prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose
m=1 is
that a set of transmit power of all users’ signals {P ∗

B. Optimal Power Allocation Policy

Having obtained Pmin, we are going to deal with the SSR
maximization problem in (6) given P ≥ Pmin. By substituting

Jm(tm).

(10)

After the reformulation, we can see that problem (6) has two
important properties: 1) the objective function Rs is the sum of
M − Me non-convex subfunctions with a uniform expression;
and 2) the arguments {γm}M
m=1 are coupled with each other
in the constraints (5) in a complicated way.

In the following we propose an algorithm to solve problem
(6) by exploiting the properties of the optimization problem.
Our basic idea is: we ﬁrstly solve the maximization problem of
each subfunction Jm(tm) for Me ≤ m ≤ M − 1 individually
subject to the constraints (6b). Then we prove that the set of the
optimal solutions to each maximization problem possesses a
unique common solution. In other words, we can ﬁnd a unique
solution that simultaneously maximizes Jm(tm) for each m
from Me to M − 1 and satisﬁes all the constraints in (6b),
which consequently solves the problem. More speciﬁcally, let
ℑm represent the set of the optimal solutions that maximize
Jm(tm) subject to all the constraints in (6b), where Me ≤
m ≤ M − 1, then our goal is to prove ℑMe ∩ ℑMe+1 ∩
m=1 is the unique
... ∩ ℑM−1 = {{γ
common solution of the M − Me optimization problems.
We now solve these optimization problems. We ﬁrst trans-
form the original problem of maximizing Jm(tm) by using its
monotonicity. The ﬁrst-order derivative of Jm(tm) is given by

This indicates that Jm(tm) is a monotonically increasing
function of tm. Thus, the maximization of Jm is equivalent
to the maximization of tm. Then, the M − Me optimization
problems mentioned above can be uniformly formulated as

Problem (12) is solved by the following proposition.

Proposition 1: The necessary and sufﬁcient condition for

prove that the constraints in (12b) are active for 1 ≤ i ≤ m and
that the constraint (12c) is active, it is necessary and sufﬁcient
to prove µi 6= 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m and λ 6= 0, respectively. To
this end, we ﬁrstly demonstrate µ1 6= 0 by contradiction:
Supposing µ1 = 0 and setting k = 1 in (14), we obtain

(20)

Obviously, (20) implies that µk = 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ m, because
µ1 = 0 and µk can be calculated sequentially in the order
2, 3, ..., k. However, under the condition that µk = 0, 1 ≤
k ≤ m, we set k = m + 1 in (14) and then obtain λ =
µm+1 + 1 > 0, which contradicts to (19) obtained using the
assumption µ1 = 0. Thus, we conclude that µ1 6= 0 and

λ = µ1 6= 0,

which demonstrates that µk > 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ m, since λ is
a positive number according to (18) and (21). Thereby, the
constraints in (12b) are active when 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
In order to obtain the closed-form solution of problem (12),
we replace PM

is proved to be active. Setting the constraints in (12b) active

for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we have the expressions of {γi}m
of tm given by (13a) and (13b), respectively. According to
(13a), γi can be obtained by recursive calculation in the order
1, 2, ..., m. Thereby, the closed-form expression for the optimal
solution, which maximizes tm, can be obtained when both the
constraints in (12b) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m and the constraint (12c)
are active. The proof is complete.
Based on Proposition 1, which solves problem (12) with
the closed-form solution given by (13), the following theorem
gives the unique solution for maximizing Rs.

the formulas (13a). This implies that more power allocation

The analysis above demonstrates that with P ≥ Pmin, the
optimal power allocation policy for maximizing the SSR of
the NOMA system is to use the extra power (P − Pmin) only
for increasing the M -th user’s secrecy rate. This is because
the M -th user has the best channel condition and thereby it is
most likely to improve the SSR of the system. That is why the
terms he and Me do not appear in the closed-form solution
given by (23), namely, the proposed power allocation policy
does not need the eavesdropper’ CSI.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we provide numerical results to demonstrate
the SSR performance of the NOMA system by using the
proposed power allocation policy. A TDMA system, where the
time slots with equal duration are allocated to users individ-
ually, is used as a benchmark. We randomly generate 50,000
channel realizations with parameters gm, ge ∼ CN (0, 1),
1 ≤ m ≤ M , α = 3, dm = de = 80m, 1 ≤ m ≤ M , and
n = −70 dBm. Particularly, when the value of the transmit
σ2
power P is not in the feasible region, the transmitter will not
send the messages. In other words, when P is not large enough
to satisfy all users’ QoS requirements, we set Rs to zero.

Fig. 1 shows the average SSR versus the transmit power.
One can see that NOMA outperforms conventional OMA
and the performance gain becomes more signiﬁcant as M
increases. This is because, a higher diversity gain is offered
when M is large, and higher spectral efﬁciency is achieved
when more users are served simultaneously.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of the QoS requirements on the
SSR performance. We can see that the SSR decreases as Qm
increases. This is because, the increase of Qm requires the

transmitter to use the extra power for improving the data
rate of the users with poor channel conditions, which will
obviously deteriorate the SSR performance. Further, as Qm
becomes very large, the SSR approaches zero, since P is not
large enough to satisfy all users’ QoS requirements and then
the transmitter does not send the messages to the users.

V. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we studied physical layer security in a SISO
NOMA system, in which each legitimate user has a predeﬁned
QoS requirement. We ﬁrstly identiﬁed the feasible region of
the transmit power for satisfying all users’ QoS requirements.
Then, the optimal power allocation policy for maximizing
the SSR was obtained in closed-form expressions. Numerical
results showed that NOMA has the superior SSR performance
compared with conventional OMA and the performance gain
is more signiﬁcant as the number of users increases. It is worth
pointing out that the highly demanding QoS requirements will
degrade the SSR performance of the system. One promising
future direction is to adopt multiple antenna settings to further
enhance the security of NOMA systems.
