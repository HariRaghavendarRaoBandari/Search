TWO HOMOLOGICAL PROOFS OF THE NOETHERIANITY OF F IG

LIPING LI

Abstract. We give two homological proofs of the Noetherianity of the category F I, a fundamental result
discovered by Church, Ellenberg, Farb, and Nagpal.

1. Preliminaries

The locally Noetherian property of the category FI, whose objects and morphisms are Ô¨Ånite sets and
injections between those sets respectively, was Ô¨Årstly established by Church, Ellenberg, and Farb in [2]
over Ô¨Åelds of characteristic 0, and by them and Nagpal in [3] over arbitrary commutative Noetherian rings.
Another proof of this fundamental result was obtained in [11] by Sam and Snowden using the Gr¬®obner
methods translated from commutative algebra. In this note we provide two new proofs via a homological
approach developed recently in a series of paper [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10] by Church, Ellenberg, Gan, Ramos, Yu
and the author.

Throughout this note we let G be a group, C be the skeletal full subcategory of FIG whose objects
are parameterized by nonnegative integers. Let k be a commutative ring with identity, and C be the k-
linearization of C. By Gn we mean the endomorphism group of the object parameterized by n. We brieÔ¨Çy
call upon the following deÔ¨Ånitions. For details, please refer to [7].

A C-module V is a covariant functor from C to k -Mod, the category of k-modules. We denote Vn the value
of V on the object parameterized by n. Let J be the ideal of C spanned by all non-invertible morphisms in
C. The torsion degree and generating degree of V are deÔ¨Åned respectively as:

td(V ) = sup{n | HomC(kGn, V ) 6= 0},

gd(V ) = td(V /JV ),

where the torsion degree is set to be ‚àí‚àû by convention whenever the above set is empty, and in that case
V is said to be torsionless.

DeÔ¨Ånition 1.1. Let V be a C-module.
kGn-module. It is generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees if gd(V ) < ‚àû.

It is locally Ô¨Ånite if for every n > 0, Vn is a Ô¨Ånitely generated

Remark 1.2. Clearly, a C-module V is Ô¨Ånitely generated if and only if it is locally Ô¨Ånite and generated in
Ô¨Ånite degrees.

DeÔ¨Ånition 1.3. Let V be a C-module. An element v ‚àà V is torsion if one has J nv = 0 for n ‚â´ 0. The
C-module V is torsion if every element in it is a torsion element.

Clearly, a C-module V is torsionless if and only if it has no torsion elements.

Lemma 1.4. Every Ô¨Ånitely generated torsion module has Ô¨Ånite torsion degree.

Proof. Let V be a Ô¨Ånitely generated torsion module. Choose a Ô¨Ånite set of generators {v1, . . . , vs} and
suppose that vi ‚àà VNi . Since these generators are torsion elements, there exist n1, . . . , ns such that J ni vi = 0.
Let n = max{n1, . . . , ns}. Then J nvi = 0 for 1 6 i 6 s. Since V is generated by v1, . . . , vs, one knows

td(V ) 6 max{ni + Ni | 1 6 i 6 s} < ‚àû.

However, if V is only generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees, then td(V ) might be ‚àû. For example, let P = Ce0 where

e0 is the identity of G0. Then the module

V = M

(P/J iP )

i>1

is generated in degree 0, but its torsion degree is ‚àû.

For V ‚àà C -Mod, there is a short exact sequence

where

0 ‚Üí VT ‚Üí V ‚Üí VF ‚Üí 0,

VT = {v ‚àà V | J nv = 0 for n ‚â´ 0}

is the torsion part of V , and VF is the torsionless part of V . Clearly, td(V ) = td(VT ).

Let Œ£ and D be the shift functor and derivative functor introduced in [2] and [1] respectively. The
following result has been described in [8, Proposition 2.4] for Ô¨Ånitely generated FI-modules. However, we
should point out that the result holds in a much more general framework. That is, it holds for any groups
G and any FIG-modules.

Lemma 1.5. Let V be a C-module. Then gd(DV ) = gd(V ) ‚àí 1 whenever DV 6= 0.

Proof. The proof provided in [8] actually works for all C-modules generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees since applying
the shift functor to a projective module generated in a certain degree n we always get a direct sum of
two projective modules generated in degree n and degree n ‚àí 1 respectively, so we only have to show that
gd(DV ) = ‚àû when gd(V ) = ‚àû. In that case, for an arbitrarily large N , one can construct a short exact
sequence

0 ‚Üí V ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí V ‚Üí V ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚Üí 0

such that V ‚Ä≤ is the submodule generated by Li6N Vi. Because gd(V ) = ‚àû, V ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ cannot be 0. Let n be the
minimal number such that V ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
n 6= 0. By deÔ¨Ånition, n > N . Applying the right exact functor D one gets a
i = 0 for i < n ‚àí 1. Therefore, gd(DV ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) > n ‚àí 1.
surjection DV ‚Üí DV ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚Üí 0. Note that DV ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
This forces gd(DV ) > n ‚àí 1 > N . Since N is arbitrarily chosen, one knows that gd(DV ) = ‚àû as well. (cid:3)

n‚àí1 6= 0 and DV ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤

2. Proofs of the main result

In this section we let k be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let G be a Ô¨Ånite group. Note that kGn is
a left Noetherian ring. Denote the category of locally Ô¨Ånite C-modules by C -lfMod. The reader can easily
see that it is an abelian category. Moreover, the shift functor Œ£ preserves locally Ô¨Ånite modules.

Lemma 2.1. A C-module V ‚àà C -lfMod is Ô¨Ånitely generated if and only if gd(V ) < ‚àû. Moreover, if
V ‚àà C -lfMod is torsion, then V is Ô¨Ånitely generated if and only if td(V ) < ‚àû.

Proof. The Ô¨Årst statement follows from Remark 1.2. The only if direction of the second statement follows
from Lemma 1.4, and the other direction of this statement is trivial since for a torsion module one always
has gd(V ) 6 td(V ).
(cid:3)

The following lemma is crucial for proving the main result.

Lemma 2.2. Let k be a commutative Noetherian ring. If V ‚àà C -lfMod is Ô¨Ånitely generated, so is VT . In
particular, td(V ) < ‚àû.

Proof. Since V ‚àà C -lfMod, so is VT as C -lfMod is an abelian category. Moreover, by Remark 1.2, one knows
that gd(V ) < ‚àû, and one has to show that gd(VT ) < ‚àû. We use induction on gd(V ) since this is supposed
to be a Ô¨Ånite number. Nothing needs to show for gd(V ) = ‚àí‚àû, so we suppose gd(V ) = n > 0.

The short exact sequence

induces the following commutative diagram

Note that VF is a torsionless module, so the map Œ¥ is injective according to [1, Lemma 3.6]. Therefore, by
the snake lemma, the bottom row is exact.

Clearly, all modules appearing in this diagram are locally Ô¨Ånite. Moreover, by Lemma 1.5, gd(DV ) <
gd(V ). By the induction hypothesis, (DV )T is a Ô¨Ånitely generated C-module; or equivalently, td((DV )T ) <
‚àû by the previous lemma. Of course, in general one cannot expect D(VT ) ‚àº= (DV )T since DVF might not
be torsionless. However, since Œ£VT is a torsion module (this can be checked easily using the deÔ¨Ånitions of
torsion modules and the shift functor), its quotient D(VT ) is torsion as well. Therefore, D(VT ) is isomorphic
to a submodule of the torsion part (DV )T , so

td(D(VT )) 6 td((DV )T ) < ‚àû.

Consequently, gd(DVT ) < ‚àû. By Lemma 1.5, gd(VT ) must be Ô¨Ånite as well. That is, VT is Ô¨Ånitely generated,
and td(V ) = td(VT ) < ‚àû. The conclusion then follows from induction.
(cid:3)

Now we are ready to give a new proof for the following well known result.

Theorem 2.3. The category FIG is locally Noetherian over any commutative Noetherian ring k.

The Ô¨Årst proof. By a standard homological argument, we only need to show the following statement:
for
n > 0, every submodule V of the projective module Cen is Ô¨Ånitely generated, where en is the identity of the
endomorphism group Gn. Since Cen is obviously a locally Ô¨Ånite C-module, by Lemma 2.1, it suÔ¨Éces to show
gd(V ) < ‚àû.

We use induction on n. If Cen = 0; that is, n < 0, nothing needs to show. Otherwise, the short exact

sequence

induces the following commutative diagram

D(Cen) ‚àº= (Cen‚àí1)n

/ W

/ Œ£W

/ DW

/ 0.

As explained in the proof of [6, Theorem 2.4], the maps Œ± and Œ≤ are injective, and the third column gives
rises to two short exact sequences

0 ‚Üí K ‚àº= ker Œ¥ ‚Üí DV ‚Üí U ‚Üí 0,
0 ‚Üí U ‚Üí (Cen‚àí1)n ‚Üí DW ‚Üí 0

with gd(K) = td(K) = td(W ).

The induction hypothesis and the second short exact sequence tell us that gd(U ) < ‚àû. Since gd(W ) < ‚àû,
the previous lemma tells us that gd(K) < ‚àû. Therefore, from the Ô¨Årst exact sequence we conclude that
gd(DV ) < ‚àû. By Lemma 1.5, gd(V ) < ‚àû. The conclusion then follows from induction.
(cid:3)

In the rest of this note we will give the second proof of the Noetherianity of FIG. For this purpose, we
carefully check the results and proofs in [8, Section 3] and get the following stronger version of [8, Theorem
3.13].

LIPING LI

Theorem 2.4. Let k be a commutative ring and V be a C-module. If both gd(V ) and td(DiV ), 0 6 i 6
gd(V ), are Ô¨Ånite, then Œ£nV is a Ô¨Åltered module for n ‚â´ 0.1

Proof. To prove this result, we use the following key proposition: Let V be a torsionless C-module generated
in Ô¨Ånite degrees. If DV is Ô¨Åltered, so is V . This was proved in [8, Section 3] for Ô¨Ånitely generated C-modules
over Noetherian rings, but the argument actually works for modules generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees over any
commutative ring. Another proof of this fact was recently described in [4].

Now let V be an C-module generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees. Since td(V ) < ‚àû, for N ‚â´ 0, one gets a short

exact sequence

0 ‚Üí Œ£N V ‚Üí Œ£N +1V ‚Üí Œ£N DV ‚àº= DŒ£N V ‚Üí 0,

such that Œ£N V is torsionless, where the isomorphism in the last term follows from [10, Lemma 3.5]. Note
that DV satisÔ¨Åes the required conditions. By the induction hypothesis, DŒ£N V ‚àº= Œ£N DV is Ô¨Åltered. By the
above proposition, Œ£N V is Ô¨Åltered.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.5. This result was proved Ô¨Årstly by Nagpal in [9, Theorem A] for Ô¨Ånitely generated FI-modules
over commutative Noetherian rings, provided that one knows the Noetherianity of FI, which obviously
implies the required condition by Lemma 2.2. In [8] Yu and the author gave another proof under the same
assumptions. Actually, the prerequisite assumption that C is locally Noetherian can be removed since we
only used the conclusion of Lemma 2.2 in the proof. Furthermore, as pointed out by Gan in [4], most
arguments in [8] still work for modules generated in Ô¨Ånite degrees over general commutative rings.

This theorem provides us another proof of the Noetherianity of FIG.

The second proof. Again, take an arbitrary n > 0 and an arbitrary submodule V of P = Cen. One needs to
show that gd(V ) < ‚àû. Consider the short exact sequence

Clearly, all DiW are Ô¨Ånitely generated. By Lemma 2.2, their torsion degrees are Ô¨Ånite. By the previous
theorem, Œ£N W is Ô¨Åltered for a large enough N . Therefore, in the following short exact sequence

0 ‚Üí V ‚Üí P ‚Üí W ‚Üí 0.

0 ‚Üí Œ£N V ‚Üí Œ£N P ‚Üí Œ£N W ‚Üí 0,

all modules must be Ô¨Åltered by [8, Corollary 3.6]. Applying the homology functor one gets a short exact
sequence

0 ‚Üí H0(Œ£N V ) ‚Üí H0(Œ£N P ) ‚Üí H0(Œ£N W ) ‚Üí 0

by [8, Theorem 3.5]; see [8, Section 3] for details. Consequently, gd(Œ£N V ) 6 gd(Œ£N P ) = n. But it is well
known that

Consequently,

so V is Ô¨Ånitely generated.

gd(V ) 6 gd(Œ£V ) + 1.

gd(V ) 6 gd(Œ£N V ) + N 6 n + N < ‚àû,

(cid:3)

We add a few more remarks at the end of this note. A careful reader can see that in the current version of
Theorem 2.4 we added a technical condition that td(DiV ), 0 6 i 6 gd(V ), are Ô¨Ånite. Indeed, for a general
C-module V over an arbitrary commutative ring, the Ô¨Åniteness of gd(V ) does not imply the Ô¨Åniteness of
td(V ), so the conclusion of Lemma 2.2 is no longer true in the wider framework. Consequently, although
gd(Di(V )) < ‚àû if gd(V ) < ‚àû, at this moment we do not know whether td(Di(V )) < ‚àû holds. So we ask
the following question:

Question 2.6. Let k be a commutative ring, and let V be torsionless C-module. Does gd(V ) < ‚àû imply
td(DV ) < ‚àû?

An aÔ¨Érmative answer of this question allows us to replace the tedious condition that all td(DiV ) < ‚àû

in Theorem 2.4 by a much simpler condition that td(V ) < ‚àû. Actually, we have:

Proposition 2.7. Let k be a commutative ring, and let V be a C-module. Then the following statements
are equivalent:

(1) td(DV ) < ‚àû whenever gd(V ) < ‚àû and td(V ) < ‚àû;

1The author thanks Weiqing Li for pointing out that a technical condition is missing from the previous statement of this

theorem.

(2) Œ£N V is Ô¨Åltered for N ‚â´ 0 whenever gd(V ) < ‚àû and td(V ) < ‚àû.

Proof. The direction (1) ‚áí (2) has been established in the proof of Theorem 2.4 since iteratively using (1)
we know that all td(DiV ) are Ô¨Ånite.

Conversely, suppose that Œ£N V is a Ô¨Åltered module for N ‚â´ 0, we have to show that td(DV ) < ‚àû.
By considering the bottom row of the commutative diagram in the proof of Lemma 2.2, it suÔ¨Éces to show
td(DVF ) < ‚àû since td(DVT ) < ‚àû.

Choose a suÔ¨Éciently large N and apply Œ£N to the exact sequence

The Ô¨Årst two terms Œ£nVF and Œ£N +1VF are Ô¨Åltered by (2), so does the third term Œ£N DVF by [8, Corollary
4.3] which still holds for modules with Ô¨Ånite generating degrees over general commutative rings. As a Ô¨Åltered
module, Œ£N DVF must be torsionless. Consequently, td(DVF ) 6 N is Ô¨Ånite.
