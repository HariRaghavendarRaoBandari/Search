The strong coupling regime is observed in a system of two-dimensional electrons whose cyclotron
motion is coupled to an electro-magnetic mode in a Fabry-Perot cavity resonator. The Rabi splitting
of eigenfrequencies of coupled motion is observed both in the cavity reﬂection spectrum and ac
current of electrons, the latter probed by measuring their bolometric photoresponse. Despite the
fact that similar observations of the Rabi splitting in many-particle systems have been described as
a quantum-mechanical eﬀect, we show that the observed splitting can be explained completely by a
model based on the classical electrodynamics.

Introduction. Recent years were marked by a signif-
icant interest in the strong coupling of a collection of
quantum particles to the electro-magnetic modes of a res-
onator. In addition to traditional quantum systems used
in cavity QED experiments such as Rydberg atoms [1–3],
strong coupling regime has been observed in various para-
magnetic [4–7] and ferromagnetic [8–10] electron spin
ensembles, a coupled nuclear-electron spin system [11],
as well as two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) in
semiconductors [12–14]. Strong coupling regime was also
studied theoretically for graphene [15, 16]. The interest
largely comes from the quantum information processing
as strong coupling to a high-Q resonator enables coherent
information transfer between, for example, a qubit and
spin system excitations [17]. The hallmark of the strong
coupling regime is the splitting in the resonator spec-
trum revealed in the signal reﬂected from or transmitted
through the resonator. In case of a collection of N quan-
tum particles this splitting scales as √N and is referred
to as the Rabi spitting. This result is usually derived by
taking into account quantization of the electro-magnetic
ﬁeld in the resonator [18, 19]. Most recently, a model
based on classical electrodynamics was used to success-
fully describe a ferromagnetic system strongly coupled to
a microwave resonator [20]. In this model, a phenomeno-
logical coupling constant K was introduced to relate, on
the one hand, the electrical current in the resonator mod-
eled by the artiﬁcial LCR circuit, and, on the other hand,
the magnetization of the ferromagnetic sample. The nu-
merical value of K was simply adjusted to reproduce the
observed splitting, and its relation to the number of spins
N was not discussed.

In this Letter, we report observation of the strong cou-
pling between cyclotron mode of 2D electrons on the
surface of liquid helium and a 3D microwave cavity res-
onator. The splitting in the eigen spectrum of coupled
motion is observed in the cavity reﬂection signal, as well
as in the ac current of electrons detected by measuring
their bolometric photoresponse. A simple model that
uses, on the one hand, an expression for the ac conduc-

tivity of electrons and, on the other hand, the classical
equations for electro-magnetic ﬁeld in the cavity accounts
for all experimental features including the observed Rabi
spitting. The square-root scaling of the splitting with the
number of electrons follows naturally from our model.

Experimental setup. Measurements were performed
at temperature of T ≈ 0.2 K in a dilution refrigerator
(Fig. 1). Liquid helium-4 was condensed into a vacuum-
tight cylindrical copper cell with internal diameter of
40 mm. A thin sapphire substrate, with three concen-
tric gold electrodes deposited on the top (the Corbino
disk), was placed in the depression which was made in
the center of the cell bottom. The electrodes had diam-
eters of 3.0, 4.26 and 5.2 mm, correspondingly, with the
gap between each adjacent electrodes of about 0.01 mm.
The top of electrodes was positioned at the same level
as the cell bottom. The electrode thickness was about
0.25 µm, and was much smaller than the liquid helium
depth. The cap of the cell was made of copper in the
form of a spherical mirror of radius 9 mm. The spherical
mirror and a ﬂat mirror, formed by bottom electrodes,
constituted a microwave Fabry-Perot resonator with the
distance of about D = 7.4 mm between the spherical
mirror top center point and the ﬂat mirror (Fig. 1a,1c).
The Fabry-Perot resonator was coupled to a microwave
waveguide via a circular aperture in the spherical mirror.
The Fabry-Perot cavity was operated at TEM003 mode
which can be described by the Gaussian beam distribu-
tion [21, 22]. The beam waist w0 was calculated to be
about 2 mm. The microwave electric ﬁeld was parallel
to the liquid helium surface, and the liquid surface was
located in the antinode of TEM003 mode (at distance
h ≈ 0.85 mm above the ﬂat mirror) at which the ampli-
tude of the microwave electric ﬁeld was maximal. The
cavity resonance frequency was ωr/2π ≈ 88.4 GHz, and
Q-factor was measured to be about 900 at low tempera-
tures. The resonator was probed by pulse modulated mi-
crowave pumping at frequency ω with modulation rate
of 5 kHz. The microwave power Pr reﬂected from the
resonator was detected by an indium antimonide (InSb)

Figure 1. (color online) (a) Experimental setup. The Fabry-
Perot cavity resonator loaded with 2DES was enclosed in a
hermetic cell mounted at the mixing chamber of a dilution
refrigerator. The resonator was connected by a waveguide to
the microwave generator, and, through directional coupler, to
InSb detector. The resonator coupling aperture and the room-
side waveguide port were sealed by Kapton thin ﬁlms (K)
glued by Stycast epoxy. Home-made ﬁlters (F) were installed
inside the waveguide to block thermal radiation. Perpendic-
ular magnetic ﬁeld was created by superconducting solenoid.
(b) Power of microwave radiation reﬂected from the resonator
was detected by the InSb hot-electron bolometer. A dc elec-
tric current was applied to the bolometer, and the bolometer
resistance variations were detected by measurements of the
voltage drop across the bolometer. (c) Scheme of the exper-
imental cell. Liquid helium was condensed into the Fabry-
Perot resonator formed by the top spherical mirror (M) and
bottom ﬂat electrodes. Electrons were injected into the cell
by thermal emission from the ﬁlament (F), and 2DES was
formed on the liquid helium surface. The dc conductance
of 2DES could be measured by the contactless technique via
capacitive coupling between 2DES and bottom electrodes.

hot-electron bolometer and synchronously demodulated
by a lock-in ampliﬁer. Sensitivity of the InSb bolometer
was measured to be about 700 V/W.

Free electrons were injected into the cell via thermal
emission from a tungsten ﬁlament mounted inside the cell
(see Fig. 1c) while a positive voltage VB was applied to
the center and middle electrodes of the Corbino disk. In
addition to the electrostatic potential created by biased
electrodes, electrons experience a long-range attractive
force towards free surface of liquid helium due to its po-
larizability. On the other hand, electrons are aﬀected by
a short-range repulsive barrier at the liquid surface due to
the negative aﬃnity of an electron to a 4He atom caused
by the Pauli exclusion principle. Due to the resultant
potential well seen by electrons, a 2DES is formed on
the free surface of liquid helium [23, 24]. These surface

2

electrons (SEs) can freely move along the helium surface,
but their vertical motion is quantized. The correspond-
ing surface energy levels are described by the hydrogen-
like spectrum. The energy diﬀerence between the ground
surface level and the ﬁrst excited level is about 0.55 meV
(≈ 6 K in terms of temperature) in zero electric press-
ing ﬁeld (VB = 0), and it increases with the increase of
pressing ﬁeld due to the linear Stark eﬀect. Therefore,
for typical temperatures used in the experiment SEs oc-
cupy the ground surface level. Density of electrons is
determined from the condition of complete screening of
electric ﬁeld above the surface, ne = ǫ0ǫVB/eh, where
ǫ0 is the vacuum permittivity, ǫ = 1.057 is liquid helium
dielectric constant, and e is the electron charge. The neg-
atively biased outer bottom electrode was used as a guard
ring to prevent electrons from escape. The magnetic ﬁeld
B perpendicular to the liquid surface was created by a
superconducting solenoid, and cyclotron resonance could
be excited by the microwave electrical ﬁeld when the fre-
quency ω matched the cyclotron frequency ωc = eB/me,
where me is the free electron mass.

Strong coupling. Figure 2a shows the reﬂected mi-
crowave power Pr obtained with SEs in the cavity under
typical experimental conditions and plotted as a function
of the microwave probe frequency ω and external mag-
netic ﬁeld in units of ωc. A pronounced avoided cross-
ing in the cavity resonance is found near the degener-
acy point, that is the point where the uncoupled cavity
mode ωr would otherwise cross the uncoupled cyclotron-
resonance mode ωc. Thus, the observed anticrossing be-
havior represents normal-mode splitting in the coupled
system of two oscillators: the cavity mode and the cy-
clotron motion of SEs. For the data presented in Fig. 2a,
we ﬁnd that the value of the splitting between two nor-
mal modes at the degeneracy point is about 2g/2π = 154
MHz. The full linewidth of the cavity mode is about
γ/2π = 100 MHz, and the full linewidth of the cyclotron
mode is approximately ν/2π = 20 MHz. Thus, the co-
operativity C = 4g2/γν ≈ 12 is larger than unity, and,
hence, strong coupling regime is realized in our experi-
ment.

The observed avoided crossing is consistent with the
Rabi splitting eﬀect, which is typically discussed in the
context of similar experiments on strong coupling be-
tween quantum particle ensembles and cavity modes [4–
12, 14, 18, 19]. In our experiment, the latter would be
given by the coupling constant g in the form g = g0√Ne,
where g0 is the coupling strength for a single electron, and
Ne is the total number of electrons coupled to the cav-
ity mode. For nondegenerate SEs occupying the lowest
energy level of cyclotron motion the coupling strength

magnetic length and E0 is the vacuum RMS electric
ﬁeld in the cavity. The latter can be estimated as

is given by (elBE0)/¯h, where lB = p¯h/meωc is the
E0 = p¯hω/2ǫ0V , where V is the cavity mode volume.

and (b) real part of dc admittance of the cell, Re(Y ), as a function of the microwave probe frequency ω and magnetic ﬁeld in
units of ωc. Electron density is ne ≈ 2 × 108 cm−2, and microwave probe power is Pin ≈ 180 nW. Dashed lines correspond to
calculated eigenfrequencies of cavity-ﬁeld-2DES coupled motion with coupling strength g/2π ≈ 77 MHz. Right side: Absolute

beam at the liquid helium surface, S = πw2
The mode volume Vm for Gaussian beam, described
by distribution E(r, z) = E0 × f (r, z), was estimated
numerically by integration over the cavity volume as
Vm = R f 2(r, z)2πrdrdz ≈ 0.02 cm3. Thus, we obtain
estimation value g/2π ≈ 200 MHz, which is comparable
with the experimental value g/2π = 77 MHz. The ob-
served dependence of the splitting on the electron density
is consistent with √Ne scaling (see insert in Fig. 3b).

In addition to microwave cavity reﬂection measure-
ments, we also performed simultaneous detection of the
ac current in the 2DES induced by cavity ﬁeld. Because
it is very diﬃcult to measure such a high frequency cur-
rent directly, we employed its detection using electron
bolometric photoresponse [25]. The method is based on
the eﬀect of heating induced by ac current of SEs on the
electron dc resistivity [26]. The latter could be probed
by measuring the complex admittance of the cell by the
capacitive-coupling (Sommer-Tanner) technique [27, 28]
using the central and middle electrodes of the Corbino

disk, see Fig. 1c. The real part of admittance, which
is proportional to electron dc resistivity, is plotted in
Fig. 2b as a function of ω and ωc. The splitting of cy-
clotron resonance mode ω = ωc, as well as its signiﬁ-
cant broadening, is clearly observed near the degeneracy
point. This measurement directly conﬁrms that the cou-
pling to microwave cavity mode modiﬁes the electron cy-
clotron motion and introduces additional damping due
to decay of the cavity ﬁeld.

Theoretical model. To understand the above results,
we developed a model of 2DES in a simpliﬁed cavity res-
onator, basing on the approach suggested in [29]. In our
model, the motion of coupled system is described by the
following equations [30]

and Ein ∝ √Pin is the electric ﬁeld component of mi-

crowave probe pump. The above equations relate the
microwave electric ﬁeld Ex and electron current density
jx in the 2DES plane through classical electrodynamics
relations and electron ac conductivity σxx = jx/Ex. For
Ein=0, the solutions of Eq. (1) are two damped eigen-
modes with frequencies plotted in Figs. 2a,b by dashed
lines. According to our model the normal mode splitting

For Ein 6= 0, Eq. (1) can be readily solved for given
pump frequency ω. The S11-parameter is given by [30]

S11 = 1 +

where γint and γext are the internal and external loss rates
of the resonator, γ = γint+γext, and δωext is the resonator
frequency shift due to external coupling. For the sake of
comparison with the experiment, |S11|2 and normalized
current density |jx/(σ0Ein)|, where σ0 = nee2/(meν),
are shown in Figs. 2c,d. Clearly, our model completely
accounts for all experimental observations.

A peculiar feature of our experimental results is a
strong dependence of the coupling regime on the mi-
crowave probe power Pin. The normal-mode splitting be-
comes noticeable only at suﬃciently high power, as shown
on Figure 3a,b. We suppose that the observed behavior
is related to the strong non-monotonic dependence of cy-
clotron resonance linewidth ν on the microwave power.
Indeed, the so called Coulomb narrowing of the cyclotron

resonance linewidth with microwave power was observed
and explained in terms of electron heating and increase
of many-electron ﬂuctuating electric ﬁeld experienced by
an electron from its neighbours [32]. This ﬁeld leads to
suppression of electron scattering within the Landau level
(LL), and, therefore, a reduction in ν. For small powers,
the cyclotron resonance linewidth is about 100 MHz [25]
and, since g < ν, γ, the system is not in the strong cou-
pling regime and the normal mode splitting is not ob-
served. With increasing power, reduction in ν allows to
reach the strong coupling regime, and the normal-mode
splitting is observed. Further increase in power leads
to further increase of many-electron ﬂuctuating electric
ﬁeld, which eventually assists the inter-LLs scattering,
resulting in an increase in ν [32, 33]. Correspondingly,
the observed normal-mode splitting diminishes, as shown
in Fig. 3b. The dependence of observed splitting on ν
obtained from our model is in good agreement with the
experiemntal observation, see [30].

In conclusion, we observed strong coupling between the
cyclotron resonance mode of 2D electrons on liquid he-
lium and the microwave cavity mode. The normal-mode
splitting is found in both microwave response and elec-
tron transport measurements, and shows correct scaling
with the number of electrons.
In contrast with usual
quantum-mechanical description of similar observations
in other experiments, our results can be completely ac-
counted for by the classical model. In our experiment,
number of electrons and microwave photon numbers can
be varied in a broad range of values, and, therefore, 2DES
on helium can be potentially utilized as a model system
for studies of diﬀerent regimes of strong light-matter in-
teraction.

FABRY-PEROT RESONATOR WITH 2DES

In our model, the Fabry-Perot Resonator (FPR) is formed by two inﬁnitely large mirrors parallel to xy-plane
located at distance D apart from each other, see Fig. 4. The top mirror (at z = 0) is a partially-reﬂecting mirror
with the (amplitude) reﬂection coeﬃcients r1 and r2 for the wave incident on the mirror from the top and bottom,
respectively. The corresponding transmission coeﬃcients are given by ti = 1 + ri, i = 1, 2. Here, we do not discuss
physical realization of such a mirror. A trivial example is the interface between dielectric media with large dielectric
constant (occupying the half-space z > 0) and vacuum. The bottom mirror (occupying the half-space z < −D)
is a good conductor with ﬁnite electrical conductivity σ, which accounts for internal losses of FPR. The inﬁnitely
large 2D Electron System (2DES) is located in xy plane at distance d < D below the top mirror . The problem of
electro-magnetic (EM) ﬁeld distribution inside and outside the resonator is solved by considering the superposition
of propagating (in z-direction) EM waves and accounting for the boundary conditions at z = −d and −D. We have

E1 = t1Ein + r2E2,
Eout = r1Ein + t2E2,
E1eikd + E2e−ikd = E3eikd + E4e−ikd,

Here, the symbol E stands for the phasor of linearly-polarized (x-direction) electric ﬁeld, jx is the current density in

The third and forth equations in Eqs.(3) express continuity of electric ﬁeld and discontinuity of magnetic ﬁeld,
respectively, at z = −d. The latter is due to non-zero electric surface current in 2DES. The ﬁfth and sixth equations

express continuity of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively, at z = −D. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that
the dielectric constant of liquid helium is equal to 1.
From Eqs. (3) we obtain a relation between the electric ﬁeld in the cavity at z = −d, that is Ex = E1eikd + E2e−ikd,
and the current density jx. Arithmetics is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed if we consider the frequency ω being close to
ω0 = cπ(m + 1)/D, where the mode number m = 0, 1, .. . In addition, we consider that 2DES is located at distance
λ0/4 = cπ/(2ω0) from the second mirror, that is at the antinode of the electric ﬁeld. Finally, we assume that r1 ≈ 1
(that is t1 ≈ 2) and r2 ≈ −1 (that is t2 << 1). Expanding in the ﬁrst order of (ω − ω0)/ω0, pωµ0/(2σ)/η0, and t2,
it is straightforward to obtain

AC CONDUCTIVITY OF 2DES

The second relation between the cavity ﬁeld Ex and current density jx can be written in terms of the longitudinal
conductivity σxx, that is jx = σxxEx. The expression for AC conductivity tensor for 2D electrons in perpendicular
magnetic ﬁeld B (z-direction) can be obtained, for example, in the memory function formalism [33]

where ωc = eB/me is the cyclotron frequency, me is the electron mass, and ne is the electron areal density. The real
part of M (ω) determines the shift of the cyclotron resonance (CR) (usually negligibly small), while the imaginary
part of M (ω) describes the CR linewidth. Deﬁning ν = Im(M (ω)) and neglecting Re(M (ω)), we obtain

NORMAL MODES OF COUPLED SYSTEM OF CAVITY FIELD AND 2DES MOTION

From Eqs. (5) and (8) we obtain a system of coupled equations (we consider the mode with m = 3)

Eq. (10) provides frequencies ω1,2 for eigen modes of the coupled cavity-ﬁeld-2DES motion. The real and imaginary
parts of ω1,2 versus ωc obtained from (10) for ne = 108 cm−2, ν = 108 s−1, ωr/2π = 88.4 GHz, and γint + γext =
4 × 108 s−1 are shown in Fig. 5a,b. Two damped eigen modes exhibit splitting at ωc = ωr. It is instructive to ﬁnd
this splitting for the case of zero losses, that is ν = 0 and γint + γext = 0. In this case, Eq. (10) reduces to

For the sake of comparison with the experiment, it is also helpful to derive expression for the reﬂection parameter

The numerical solutions for |S11|2 and jx/Ein obtained using Eqs. (9,12) for the same conditions as in Fig. 5a,b

are shown and compared with experimental results in Fig. 2 in the main text.

NORMAL-MODE SPLITTING VERSUS DAMPING RATE

The normal-mode splitting, which in the experiment appears in the cavity reﬂection spectrum, shows strong depen-
dence on the damping rate ν. Fig. 5c shows |S11|2 calculated using Eq. (12) for ne = 108 cm−2, ωc/2π = 88.35 GHz,
ωr/2π = 88.4 GHz, γint + γext = 4 × 108 s−1, and several values of ν. The splitting disappears for damping rates
ν >
∼ 109 s−1. This result should be compared with the experimental result shown in Fig. 3a in the main text.
