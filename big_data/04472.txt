ON UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION FOR
INVARIANT EXTENSIONS OF THE

LINEAR LEBESGUE MEASURE

Abstract

The concept of uniform distribution in [0, 1] is extended for a certain
strictly separated maximal (in the sense of cardinality) family (λt)t∈[0,1]
of invariant extensions of the linear Lebesgue measure λ in [0, 1], and it
is shown that the λ∞
t measure of the set of all λt-uniformly distributed
sequences is equal to 1, where λ∞
t denotes the inﬁnite power of the
measure λt. This is an analogy of Hlawka’s (1956) theorem for λt-
uniformly distributed sequences. An analogy of Weyl’s (1916) theorem
is obtained in the similar manner.

Introduction

The theory of uniform distribution is concerned with the distribution of real
numbers in the unit interval (0, 1) and it’s development started with Hermann
Weyl’s celebrated paper [22]. This theory gives a useful technique for numer-
ical calculation exactly of the one-dimensional Riemann integral over [0, 1].

More pricisely, the sequence of real numbers (xn)n∈N ∈ [0, 1]∞ is uniformly
distributed in [0, 1] if and only if for every real-valued Riemann integrable
function f on [0, 1] the equality

holds( see, for example [11], Corollary 1.1, p. 3). Main corollaries of this
assertion successfully were used in Diophantine approximations and have ap-
plications to Monte-Carlo integration (cf.
[22],[24],[23],[11]). Note that the
set S of all uniformly distributed sequences in [0, 1] viewed as a subset of
[0, 1]∞ has full λ∞-measure, where λ∞ denotes the inﬁnite power of the linear
lebesgue measure λ in [0, 1]( cf.
[11], Theorem 2.2(Hlawka), p. 183). For a
ﬁxed Lebesgue integrable function f in [0, 1], one can state a question asking
what is a maximal subset Sf of S each element of which can be used for cal-
culation it’s Lebesgue integral over [0, 1] by the formula (1.1) and whether this
subset has the full λ∞-measure. This question has been resolved positively by
Kolmogorov’s Strong Law of Large Numbers. There naturally arises another
question asking whether can be developed analogous methodology for invari-
ant extensions of the Lebesgue measure in [0, 1] and whether main results of
the uniform distribution theory will be preserved in such a situation. In the
present manuscript we consider this question for a certain strictly separated
1 maximal (in the sense of cardinality) family of invariant extensions of the
linear Lebesgue measure in [0, 1]. In our investigations we essentially use the
methodology developed in works [5], [19], [11].

The rest of the present paper it the following.

In Section 2 we consider some auxiliary facts from the theory of invariant
extensions of the Lebesgue measure and from the probability theory. In Section
3 we present our main results. Section 4 presents historical background of the
theory of invariant extensions of the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure as well
Haar measure in locally compact Hausdorﬀ topological groups. In Section 5
we state a uniform distribution problem for invariant extensions of the Haar
measure in locally compact Hausdorﬀ topological groups.

1The family of probability measures (µi)i∈I deﬁned on the measure space (E, S) is called
strictly separated if there exists a partition {Ei : i ∈ N &Ei ∈ S} of the set E such that
µi(Ei) = 1 for i ∈ I.

2 Some auxiliary notions and facts from the theory of

invariant extensions of the Lebesgue measure

As usual, we denote by R the real axis with usual metric and addition ′′+′′
operation under which R stands a locally compact σ-compact Hausdorﬀ topo-
logical group. We denote by λ the linear Lebesgue measure in R.

Lemma 2.1. ([5], Lemma 6, p. 174) Let K be a shift-invariant σ-ideal of
subsets of the real axis R such that

(∀Z)(Z ∈ K → λ∗(Z) = 0),

where λ∗ denotes an inner measure deﬁned by the linear Lebesgue measure λ.
Then the functional µ deﬁned by

µ((X ∪ Z ′) ∪ Z ′′) = λ(X),

where X is Lebesgue measurable subset of R and Z ′ and Z ′′are elements of
the σ-ideal K,

is a shift-invariant extension of the Lebesgue measure λ.

For the proof of Lemma 2.1, see, e.g., [5], [7].

Lemma 2.2. ([5], Lemma 4, p. 164) There exists a family (Xi)i∈[0,1] of
subsets of the real axis R such that:

1) (∀i)(∀i′)(i ∈ [0, 1] & i′ ∈ [0, 1] & i 6= i′ → Xi ∩ Xi′ = ∅);
2) (∀i)(∀F )(i ∈ [0, 1] & (F is a closed subset of the real axis R with λ(F ) >

0) → card(Xi ∩ F ) = c);

3) (∀I ′)(∀g)(I ′ ⊆ [0, 1] & g ∈ R → card(g + (Si∈I ′ Xi)△(Si∈I ′ Xi)) < c).

Lemma 2.3. There exists a family (µt)t∈[0,1] of measures deﬁned on some
shift-invariant σ-algebra S(R) of subsets of the real axis R such that:

1)

(∀t)(t ∈ [0, 1] → the measure µt is a shift-invariant extension of the

linear Lebesgue measure λ);

2)

(∀t)(∀t′)(t ∈ [0, 1] & t′ ∈ [0, 1] & t 6= t′ → µt and µt′ are orthogonal
2 measures. Moreover, µt(R \ Xt) = 0 for each t ∈ [0, 1], where (Xt)t∈[0,1]
comes from Lemma 2.2. ).

Proof. For arbitrary t ∈ [0, 1], we denote by Kt an shift-invariant σ-ideal
generated by the set R \ Xt. Then it is easy to verify that the σ-ideal Kt
satisﬁes all conditions of Lemma 2.1. Let us denote by µt the shift-invariant

2 µt and µt′ are called orthogonal if there exists X ∈ S(R) such that µt(X) = 0 and

µt′ (R \ X) = 0.

4

A.Kirtadze, G. Pantsulaia, N. Rusiashvili

extension of the Lebesgue measure λ produced by the σ-ideal Kt. We obtain
the family (µt)t∈[0,1] of shift-invariant extensions of the Lebesgue measure λ.
Denote by S(R) the shift-invariant σ-algebra of subsets of the real axis R,

generated by the union

F (R) ∪ L(R) ∪ {Xt : t ∈ [0, 1]},

where

F (R) = {X : X ⊆ R & card(X) < c}

and L(R) denotes the class of all Lebesgue measurable subsets of the real axis
R.

Also, assume that

(∀t)(t ∈ [0, 1] → µt = µt|S(R)).

If we consider the family of shift-invariant measures (µt)t∈[0,1], we can

easily conclude that this family satisﬁes all conditions of Lemma 2.3.

Remark 2.4. Let consider the family (µt)t∈[0,1] of shift-invariant extensions of
the measure λ which comes from Lemma 2.3. Let denote by λt the restriction
of the measure µt to the class

S[0, 1] := {Y ∩ [0, 1] : Y ∈ S(R)},

It is obvious that for each t ∈ [0, 1],
where S(R) comes from Lemma 2.3.
the measure λt is concentrated on the set Ct = Xt ∩ [0, 1] provided that
λt([0, 1] \ Ct) = 0.

The next proposition is useful for our further consideration.

Lemma 2.5. ( Kolmogorov Strong Law of Large Numbers, [19],Theorem 3,
p.379) Let (Ω, S, P ) be a probability space and (ξk)k∈N be a sequence of inde-
pendent equally distributed random variables for which mathematical expecta-
tion m of ξ1 is ﬁnite. Then the following condition

3 Uniformly distribution for invariant extensions of the

Lebesgue measure deﬁned by Remark 2.4

Let consider the family of probability measures (λt)t∈[0,1] and the family
(Ct)t∈[0,1] of subsets of [0, 1] which come from Remark 2.4.

Lemma 3.1. For t ∈ [0, 1], we denote by L([0, 1], λt) the class of λt-integrable
functions. Then for f ∈ L([0, 1], λt), we have

λ∞

Proof. For ﬁxed t ∈ [0, 1], we set

t ),

where

i) F (Ct) = {Ct ∩ Y : Y ∈ S[0, 1]}, where S[0, 1] comes from Remark 2.4.
ii) νt = λt| F (Ct), where λt| F (Ct) denotes restriction of the measure λt to

the sigma algebra F (Ct).

For k ∈ N and (xk)k∈N ∈ C∞

t we put ξk((xi)i∈N ) = f (xk). Then all

conditions of Lemma 2.5 are satisﬁed which implies that

Deﬁnition 3.2. A sequence of real numbers (xk)k∈N ∈ [0, 1]∞ is said to be
λ-uniformly distributed sequence (abbreviated λ-u.d.s.) if for each c, d with
0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we have

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d])

n

= d − c.

(3.1)

We denote by S the set of all real valued sequences from [0, 1]∞ which
are λ-u.d.s. It is well known that ({αn})n∈N ∈ S for each irrational number
α, where {·} denotes the fractional part of the real number(cf. [11], Exercise
1.12, p. 16).

Deﬁnition 3.3. A sequence of real numbers (xk)k∈N ∈ R∞ is said to be
uniformly distributed module 1 if the sequence it’s fractional parts ({xk})k∈N
is λ-u.d.s.

Remark 3.4. It is obvious that (xk)k∈N ∈ (0, 1)∞ is uniformly distributed
module 1 if and only if (xk)k∈N is λ-u.d.s.

Deﬁnition 3.5. A sequence of real numbers (xk)k∈N ∈ [0, 1]∞ is said to be
λt-uniformly distributed sequence (abbreviated λt-u.d.s.) if for each c, d with
0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we have

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d] ∩ Ct)

n

= d − c.

(3.2)

We denote by St the set of all real valued sequences from [0, 1]∞ which are

λt-u.d.s.

In order to construct λt-u.d.s.

for each t ∈ [0, 1], we need the following

lemma.

Lemma 3.6. ( [11], THEOREM 1.2, p. 3) If the sequence (xn)n∈N is u.d.
mod 1, and if (yn)n∈N is a sequence with the property limn→∞(xn − yn) = α
for some real constant α , then (yn)n∈N is u.d. mod 1.

Theorem 3.7. For each t ∈ [0, 1], there exists λt-u.d.s.

Proof. Let consider a sequence (xn)n∈N ∈ (0, 1)∞ which is λ-u.d.s. For
each n ∈ N , we choose such an element yn from the set Ct ∩ (0, xn) that
|xn − yn| < 1
n . This we can do because Ct is everywhere dense in (0, 1).
Now it is obvious that limn→∞(xn − yn) = 0. By Lemma 3.6 we deduce that
(yn)n∈N is λ-u.d.s. Let us show that (yn)n∈N is λt-u.d.s. Indeed, since yk ∈ Ct
for each k ∈ N and (yn)n∈N is λ-u.d.s., for each c, d with 0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we
have

(3.3)

Theorem 3.8. For each t ∈ [0, 1], λt-u.d.s. is λ-u.d.s..

Proof. Let (xk)k∈N be λt-u.d.s. On the one hand, for each c, d with 0 ≤ c <
d ≤ 1 we have

limn→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d])

n

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d] ∩ Ct)

(3.4)

Since (xk)k∈N is λt-u.d.s., we have

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [0, 1] ∩ Ct)

n

= 1.

(3.5)

It is obvious that

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [0, 1])

n

= 1.

(3.6)

The last two conditions implies that

(d − c) + 0 = d − c.

(3.9)

This ends the proof of theorem.

Remark 3.9. Note that the converse to the result of Theorem 3.8 is not valid.
Indeed, for ﬁxed t ∈ [0, 1], let (yn)n∈N be λt-u.d.s. which comes from Theorem
3.7. By Theorem 3.8, (yn)n∈N is λ-u.d.s. Let us show that (yn)n∈N is not
λs-u.d.s. for each s ∈ [0, 1] \ {t}. Indeed, since yk ∈ Ct for each k ∈ N , we
deduce that yk /∈ Cs for each s ∈ [0, 1] \ {t}. The latter relation implies that
for each s ∈ [0, 1] \ {t} and for each c, d with 0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we have

lim
n→∞

#({yk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d] ∩ Cs)

n

= 0 < d − c.

(3.10)

Remark 3.10. For each λ-u.d.s. (yn)n∈N there exists a countable subset T ⊂
[0, 1] such that (yn)n∈N is not λt-u.d.s for each t ∈ [0, 1] \ T . Indeed, since
{Ct : t ∈ [0, 1]} is the partition of the [0, 1], for each k ∈ N there exists a
unique tk ∈ [0, 1] such that yk ∈ Ctk . Now we can put T = ∪k∈N {tk}.

Theorem 3.11. There exists λ-u.d.s which is not λt-u.d.s. for each t ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Let consider a sequence (xn)n∈N ∈ (0, 1)∞ which is λ-u.d.s. Since
{Ct : t ∈ [0, 1]} is the partition of the [0, 1], for each k ∈ N there exists a
unique tk ∈ [0, 1] such that yk ∈ Ctk . Now we can put T = ∪k∈N {tk}. Let
S0 = {s1, s2, · · · } be a countable subset of the set [0, 1] \ T . For each n ∈ N ,
we choose such element yn from the set Csn ∩ (0, xn) that |xn − yn| < 1
n . This
we can do because Ct is everywhere dense in (0, 1) for each t ∈ [0, 1]. Now it
is obvious that limn→∞(xn − yn) = 0. By Lemma 3.6 we deduce that (yn)n∈N
is λ-u.d.s. Let us show that (yn)n∈N is not λt-u.d.s. for each t ∈ [0, 1]. This
follows from the fact that card({yn : n ∈ N } ∩ Ct) ≤ 1 for each t ∈ [0, 1]. By
this reason for each t ∈ [0, 1] and for each c, d with 0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we have

Theorem 3.12. Si ∩ Sj = ∅ for each diﬀerent i, j ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Assume the contrary and let (xk)k∈N ∈ Si ∩ Sj. On the one hand,
for each c, d with 0 ≤ c < d ≤ 1 we have

lim
n→∞

#({xk : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∩ [c, d] ∩ Ci)

On the other hand, for same c, d we have

By Theorem 3.8 we know that (xk)k∈N is λ-u.d.s. which implies that for same
c, d we have

lim

We get the contradiction and theorem is proved.

We have the following version of Hlawka’s theorem(cf. [25] ) for λt-uniformly

distributed sequences.

Theorem 3.13. For t ∈ [0, 1], we have λ∞

t (St) = 1.

Proof. Let (fk)k∈N be a countable subclass of L([0, 1], λt) which deﬁnes a

We have the following analogue of H.Weyl theorem ( cf.

[22] ) for λt-

uniformly distributed sequences.

Theorem 3.14. For t ∈ [0, 1], we put Ct[0, 1] = {˜h(x) = h(x) × χCt(x) : h ∈
C[0, 1]}. Then the sequence (xn)n∈N is λt-u.d.s. if and only if the following

˜h(x)dλt(x)

(3.16)

holds for each ˜h ∈ Ct[0, 1].
Proof. Let (xn)n∈N be λt-u.d.s. and let f (x) = Pk−1
i=1 diχ[ai,ai+1[∩Ct(x) be
a spatial step function on [0, 1] , where 0 = ao < a1 < · · · < ak = 1. Then it
follows from (3.2) that for every such f equation (3.16) holds. We assume now
that ˜f ∈ Ct[0, 1]. Given any ǫ > 0, there exist, by the deﬁnition of the Riemann
integral, two step functions, f1 and f2 say, such that f1(x) < f (x) < f2(x) for
all x ∈ [0, 1] and

Z[0,1]

(f2(x) − f1(x))dλ(x) < ǫ.

Then it is obvious that f1(x)χCt (x) < ˜f (x) < f2(x)χCt (x) for all x ∈ [0, 1]
and

Z[0,1]

(f2(x)χCt (x) − f1(x)χCt (x))dλt(x) = Z[0,1]

(f2(x) − f1(x))dλ(x) < ǫ.

Then we have the following chain of inequalities:

So that in the case of a function ˜f the relation (3.16) holds.
Conversely, let a sequence (xn)n∈N be given, and suppose that (3.16) holds
for every ˜f ∈ Ct[0, 1]. Let [a, b) be an arbitrary subinterval of [0, 1]. Given any

4 Historical Background for invariant extensions of the

Haar measure

4.1 On Waclaw Sierpiniski problem

By Vitali’s celebrate theorem about existence of the linear Lebesgue non-
measurable subset has been shown that the domain of the Lebesgue measure
in R diﬀers from the power set of the real axis R. In this context the following
question was naturally appeared:

”How far can we extend Lebesgue measure and what properties can such

an extension preserve?”

In 1935 E. Marczewski, applied Sierpi´nski construction of an almost invari-
ant set A, obtained a proper invariant extension of the Lebesgue measure in
which the extended σ-algebra had contained new sets of positive ﬁnite mea-
sure.
In connection with this result, Waclaw Sierpiniski in 1936 posed the
following

Problem (Waclaw Sierpi´niski) Let Dn denotes the group of all isomet-
rical transformations of the Rn. Does there exist any maximal Dn -invariant
measure?

The ﬁrst result in this direction was obtained by Andrzej Hulanicki [27] as

follows:

Proposition ( Andrzej Hulanicki (1962)) If the continuum 2ℵ0 is not real
valued measurable cardinal then there does not exist any maximal invariant
extension of the Lebesgue measure.

This result was also obtained independently by S. S. Pkhakadze [18] using

similar methods.

In 1977 A. B. KHarazishvili got the same answer in the one-dimensional

case without any set-theoretical assumption (see [4] ).

Finally, in 1982 Krzysztof Ciesielski and Andrzej Pelc generalized Kharazishvili’s

result to all n-dimensional Euclidean spaces (see [1]).

Following Solovay [20], if the system of axioms ”ZF C & There exists inac-
cessible cardinal” is consistent then the systems of axioms ” ZF &CD & Every
set of reals is Lebesgue measurable” is also consistent. This result implies that
the answer to Waclaw Sierpiniski’s problem is aﬃrmative.

Taking Solovay’s result on the one hand, and Krzysztof Ciesielski and An-
drzej Pelc (or Andrzej Hulanicki or Pkhakadze) result on the other hand, we
deduce that the Waclaw Sierpiniski’s question is not solvable within the theory
ZF &CD.

4.2 On Lebesgue measure’s invariantly extension methods in ZF C

Now days there exists a reach methodology for a construction of invariant
extensions of the Lebesgue measure in Rn as well the Haar measure in a
locally compact Hausdorﬀ topological group. Let us brieﬂy consider main of
them.

Method I.( Jankowka-Wiatr) Following [28], the ﬁrst idea of extending
the Lebesgue measure in Rn to a larger σ-algebra in such a what that it
remains invariant under translations belongs to Jankowka-Wiatr who in 1928
observed that one can add new sets to the σ-ideal of sets of Lebesgue measure
zero and still preserve the invariance of the extended measure. This method
can be described as follows:

Let K be a shift-invariant σ-ideal in the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn

such that

(∀Z)(Z ∈ K → m∗(Z) = 0),

where m∗ denotes the inner measure deﬁned by n-dimensional Lebesgue mea-
sure m. Then the functional m deﬁned by

m((X ∪ Z ′) \ Z ′′) = m(X),

where X is a Borel subset of Rn and Z ′ and Z ′′are elements of the σ-ideal K,
is an Dn-invariant extension of the Lebesgue measure measure m.

Method II.( E. Szpilrajn(E. Marczewski)) By using Sierpi´nski’s decom-
position {A, B} of the R2, E. Szpilrajn noted that the following two conditions

(i) card(A triandle(x + A)) < c, card(A△(x + A)) < c for each x ∈ R2;
(ii) card(A ∩ F ) = card(B ∩ F ) = 2ℵ0 for each closed set F ⊆ R2 whith

m(F ) > 0.

holds true.
Further, he constructed a proper shift-invariant extension m of the Lebesgue

measure m in R2 as follows

m((A ∩ X) ∪ (B ∩ Y )) = 1/2(m(X) + m(y))

14

for X, Y ∈ dom(m).

Method III. ( Oxtoby and Kakutani ) Some methods of combinatorial
set theory have lately been successfully used in measure extension problem.
Among them, special mention should be made of the method of constructing a
maximal (in the sense of cardinality) family of independent families of sets in
arbitrary inﬁnite base spaces. The question of the existence of a maximal (in
the sense of cardinality) ℵ0-independent 4family of subsets of an uncountable
set E was considered by A. Tarski. He proved that this cardinality is equal to
2card(E).

This result found an interesting application in general topology. For ex-
ample, it was proved that in an arbitrary inﬁnite space E the cardinality of
the class of all ultraﬁlters is equal to 22card(E)

(see, e.g., [12]).

The combinatorial question of the existence of a maximal (in the sense of
cardinality) strict ℵ0-independent family of subsets of a set E with cardinality
of the continuum also was investigated and was proved that this cardinality is
equal to 2c.

This combinatorial result found an interesting application in the Lebesgue
measure theory. For example, Kakutani and Oxtoby [3] ﬁrstly constructed a
family A of almost invariant subsets of the circle in such a way that

∩∞
n=1Aǫn

n

has outer measure 1 for an arbitrary sequence {An} of sets from A and ar-
bitrary sequence {ǫn}, ǫn = 0, 1. The putting m(A) = 1/2 for A in A they
obtained an extension of the Lebesgue measure on the circle to an invariant
measure m such that L2(m) has the Hilbert space dimensional equal to 2c.

Using the same combinatorial result, A.B. Kharazishvili constructed a max-
imal (in the sense of cardinality) family of orthogonal elementary Dn-invariant
extensions of the Lebesgue measure (see [5]).

The combinatorial question of the existence of a maximal (in the sense of
cardinality) strict ℵ0-independent family of subsets of a set E with card(Eℵ0 ) =
card(E) was investigated in [15] and it was shown that this cardinality is
equal to 2card(E). Using this result, G.Pantsulaia [13] extended Kakutani
and Oxtoby [3] method for a construction of a maximal (in the sense of
cardinality) family of orthogonal elementary H-invariant extensions of the
Haar measure deﬁned in a locally compact σ-compact topological group with
card(H ℵ0 ) = card(H).

4We say that a family (Xi)i∈I of subsets of the set E is ℵ0-independent if the condition
(∀J)(J ⊂ I & card(J) < ℵ0 → Ti∈J X i 6= ∅) holds, where (∀i)(i ∈ I → (X i = Xi) ∨ (X i =
(E\Xi))). If in addition, this condition holds true for each J with card(J) ≤ ℵ0, then
(Xi)i∈I is called strict ℵ0-independent.

Method IV.( Kodaira and Kakutani method) Kodaira and Kakutani
[10] invented the following method of extended the Lebesgue measure on the
circle to an invariant measure as follows:

Let produce a character π of the circle, i.e. a homomorphism π : T → T in
such a way that the outer Lebesgue measure of its graph Dπ is equal to 1 in
T × T . Then the extended σ-algebra B consists of sets AM = {x : (x, π(x)) ∈
M }, where M is Lebesgue measurable set in T × T and the extended measure
m is m(AM ) = (m × m)(M ). Note that the discontinuous character π becomes
B-measurable. It has been noticed later in [26] that one can produce 2c such
characters so that they all become measurable and L2(m) is of Hilbert space
dimension 2c.

This method have been modiﬁed for n-dimensional Euclidean space in
[15](Received 7. November 1993) for a construction of the invariant extension
µ of the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure such that there exists a µ-measurable
set with only one density point. This result answered positively to a certain
question stated by A.B. Kharazishvili (cf.
[5], Problem 9, p. 200). Know-
ing this result, A.B. Kharazishvili considered similar but originally modiﬁed
method and extended previous result in [6]( Received 15. March 1994) as fol-
lows: there exists an invariant extension µ of the classical Lebesgue measure
such that µ has the uniqueness property and there exists a µ-measurable set
with only one density point..

Method ⋆ . More lately, Kodaira and Kakutani method have been mod-
iﬁed for an uncountable locally compact σ-compact topological group H with
card(H ℵ0 ) = card(H) in [16] as follows: Let E be a set with 2 ≤ card(E) ≤
card(H) and let µ be a probability measure in E such that each X ∈ dom(µ)
for which card(X) < card(E). Let produce a function f : H → E in such a
way that the following two conditions

1) (∀e)(∀F )(e ∈ E & (F is a closed subset of the H with m(F ) > 0) →

cardf −1(e) ∩ F ) = card(E));

2) (∀E′)(∀g)(E′ ⊆ E & g ∈ H → card(g(Se∈E ′ f −1(e))△(Se∈E ′ f −1(e))) <

card(H)).

holds true. Then the extended σ-algebra B consists of sets AM = {x :
(x, f (x)) ∈ M }, where M ∈ dom(m) × dom(µ). Then the extended measure
mµ is deﬁned by mµ(AM ) = (m × µ)(M ). Note that mµ is a non-elementary
invariant extension of the measure m iﬀ the measure µ is diﬀused. It has been
noticed that one can produce 2card(H) such functions so that they all become
measurable and L2(mµ) is of Hilbert space dimension 2card(H).

Note that when card(E) = 2, µ is a normalized counting measure in E
and f : R2 → E is deﬁned by f (x) = χA(x), then Method ⋆ gives Marczewski
method.

16

A.Kirtadze, G. Pantsulaia, N. Rusiashvili

When H = E = T , µ = m and f = π is a character, then Method ⋆ gives

Kodaira and Kakutani method.

Now let us discuss whether Method ⋆ gives Oxtoby and Kakutani method.

In this context we need some auxiliary facts.

Lemma 4.1. ( [17], Theorem 11.1 , p. 158 ) If an inﬁnite set E satisﬁes
the condition

Card(Eℵ0 ) = card(E),

then there exists a maximal (in the sense of cardinality) strictly ℵ0-independent
family (Ai)i∈I of subsets of the space E, such that

card(I) = 2card(E).

Lemma 4.2. ( [17], Lemma 11.2 , p. 163 ) Let H be an arbitrary locally
compact σ-compact topological group, λ be the Haar measure deﬁned on the
group H and let α be an arbitrary cardinal number such that:

α ≤ card(H).

Then there exists a family (Xi)i∈I of subsets of the set H such that:
1) Card(I) = α;
2) (∀i)(∀i′)(i ∈ I & i′ ∈ I & i 6= i′ → Xi ∩ Xi′ = ∅);
3) (∀i)(∀F )(i ∈ I & (F is a closed subset of the space H with λ(F ) > 0) →
card(Xi ∩ F ) = card(H));

4) (∀I ′)(∀g)(I ′ ⊆ I & g ∈ H → card(g(Si∈I ′ Xi)△(Si∈I ′ Xi)) < card(H)).

Lemma 4.3. ( [17], Lemma 11.5 , p. 169 ) Let E be an uncountable base
space with card(Eℵ0 ) = card(E). Then there exists a non-atomic probability
measure P such that the following conditions hold:

a)
b)

(∀X)(X ⊆ E & card(X) < card(E) → P(X) = 0);
the topological weight a(P) of the metric space (dom(P), ρP ) associated

with measure P is maximal, in particular, is equal to 2card(E).

Now put H = G and E = {0, 1}N . For g ∈ G, we put h(g) = (g, i), where
i is a unique index for which g ∈ Xi(cf. Lemma 4.2 for α = card(H) = 2ℵ0).
We set Ai = ∪e∈Xi f −1(e) for i ∈ I. Let P comes from 4.3. Now if we consider
the invariant extension mP of the measure m, we observe that mP (As) = 1/2
for each As ∈ A := {Ai : i ∈ I}. Since A is the family of strictly ℵ0-
independent almost invariant subsets of G, we claim that Method ⋆ gives just
above described Oxtoby and Kakutani method.

Method V. ( Kharazishvili ). This approach, as usual, can be used for
uncountable commutative groups and is based on purely algebraic properties

On uniform distribution for invariant extensions · · ·

17

those groups, which are not assumed to be endowed with any topology but only
are equipped with a nonzero σ-ﬁnite invariant measures. Here essentially is
used Kulikov’s well known theorem about covering of any commutative group
by increasing (in the sense of inclusion) countable sequence of subgroups of G
which are direct sum of cyclic groups (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) (see, for example [8],
[9]).

Deﬁnition 4.4(Krarazishvili) Let E be a base space, G be a group of
transformations of E and let X be a subset of the space E. X is called a G-
absolutely negligible set if for any G-invariant σ-ﬁnite measure µ, there exists
its G−invariant extension ¯µ such that X ∈ dom(¯µ) and ¯µ(X) = 0.

A geometrical characterization of absolutely negligible subsets, due to A.B.

Kharazishvili, is presented in the next proposition.

Theorem 4.5 Let E be a base space, G be a group of transformations of
E containing some uncountable subgroup acting freely in E, and X be an arbi-
trary subset of the space E. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:

1) X is a G-absolutely negligible subset of the space E;
2)

for an arbitrary countable G-conﬁguration 5 X ′ of the set X, there

exists a countable sequence (hk)k∈N of elements of G

hk(X ′) = ∅.

\k∈N

It is of interest that the class of all countable G-conﬁgurations of the ﬁxed
G-absolutely negligible subset constitutes a G-invariant σ-ideal such that the
inner measure of each element of this class is zero with respect to any σ-
ﬁnite G-invariant measure in E. Hence, by using the natural modiﬁcation of
the Method I one can obtain G -invariant extension of an arbitrary σ-ﬁnite
G-invariant measure in E.

In 1977 A. B. Kharazishvili constructed the partition of the real axis R
in to the countable family of D1 -absolutely negligible sets and got the nega-
tive answer to the question of Waclaw Sierpi´niski in the one-dimensional case
without any set-theoretical assumption (see [4]).

Finally, in 1982 Krzysztof Ciesielski and Andrzej Pelc generalized Kharazishvili’s

result to all n-dimensional Euclidean spaces, more precisely, they constructed
the partition of the Euclidean space Rn in to the countable family of Dn
-absolutely negligible sets and got the negative answer to the question of Wa-
claw Sierpi´niski in the n-dimensional case without any set-theoretical assump-
tion (see [1]).

5A subset X ′ of E is called a countable G-conﬁguration of X if there is a countable

family {gk : k ∈ N } of elements of G such that X ′ ⊆ ∪k∈N gk(X).

18

A.Kirtadze, G. Pantsulaia, N. Rusiashvili

By using the method of absolutely negligible sets elaborated by A.Kharazishvili

[5], P. Zakrzewski [29] answered positively to a question of Ciesielski [2] ask-
ing whether an isometrically invariant σ-ﬁnite countably additive measure on
Rn admits a strong countably additive isometrically invariant extension. It is
obvious that this question is generalization of the above mentioned Waclaw
Sierpi´niski problem.

5 Discussion

Let G be a compact Hausdorﬀ topological group and λ be a Haar measure in
H. By B(G) we mean the set of all bounded real-valued Borel-measurable
functions on G. Under the norm ||f || = supg∈G |f (g)| for f ∈ B(G), the
set B(G) forms a Banach space, and even a Banach algebra if algebraic
operations for functions are deﬁned in the usual way. The subset R(G) of
B(G) consisting of all real-valued continuous functions on G is then a Banach
subalgebra of B(G).

Following [11](see Deﬁnition 1.1, p.171), The sequence (xn)n∈N of elements

in G is called λ-u.d. in G if

n→∞ Pn

for all f ∈ R(G).

Note that the theory of uniform distribution is well developed in compact
Hausdorﬀ topological groups (see, for example [11], Chapter 4) as well the the-
ory of invariant extensions of Haar measures in the same groups(see Section
4). Here naturally arise a question asking whether can be introduced the con-
cept of uniform distribution for invariant extensions of the Haar measure in
compact Hausdorﬀ topological groups. We wait that by using similar manner
used in Section 3 and the methodology brieﬂy described in Section 4, one can
resolve this question.
