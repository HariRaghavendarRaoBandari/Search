The Interfacial Energy of a Phase Boundary via a
Lattice-Cell Average Approach

March 10, 2016

Abstract The lattice-cell average of the discrete atomistic energy of a crystal is introduced. It is used to ﬁnd
continuum expressions for surface energies and interfacial energies of coherent phase boundaries in deformed
crystals.

1 Introduction

The description of the atomistic energy of a crystal near the continuum limit entails various difﬁculties, some
of which are geometric in nature. These stem from the discrepancy between the continuum region occupied
by the body, and the discrete collection of lattice points contained in it. The energy in question is

e 3

x∈W ∩e L

z∈W ∩e L

(cid:19) .

Here W ⊂ R3 is the continuous body (macroscopic reference region), L ⊂ R3 is a simple (Bravais) lattice,
e > 0 is a scaling factor proportional to the lattice parameter of the scaled lattice e L, F
: R3 → R is the
interatomic potential for pair interactions and y : W → R3 a macroscopic deformation, which we assume
is followed by all atoms. The discrete body is W ∩ e L. Blanc, LeBris & Lions (Theorem 3, [4]) obtain an
asymptotic expansion of (1) for sufﬁciently smooth diffeomorphisms y:
U((cid:209) y,(cid:209)

y)dx + O(e 2),

G ((cid:209) y,¶W

e → 0.

Ee {y,W } =ZW

W ((cid:209) y)dx + e Z¶W

)dA + e 2ZW

Here the volume integrands, namely the stored energy function W and higher gradient energy function U, are
explicitly determined (see (17) for W ), but the surface energy density G and certain other surface terms of
O(e 2) are not. The reasons for this are geometrical. Given the continuous body W

general equal to the so-called discrete volume e 3#(W ∩e L), the number of lattice points in W

, the volume |W

known as the remainder, is the subject of the lattice point problem in number theory, aspects of which are still
open; e.g., Beck & Robins [2]. Even in simple cases, e.g., W
a sphere, the remainder is highly oscillatory and

R(e ) = |W

its asymptotic expansion in powers of e depends on the e sequence. The representation (2) holds provided
e = e k → 0, as k → ¥
, k ∈ Z, where e k is a putative sequence of scale factors such that the remainder vanishes:
R(e k) = 0. This condition1 points to the geometrical discrepancy between the discrete and continuous bodies
as the culprit for the fact that the asymptotic expansion of the energy in powers of e depends on the choice of
sequence of e → 0. In one dimension, this is demonstrated directly by Mora-Corral [6], who obtains all terms
up to order e 2 and their deprendence on the e -sequence explicitly.

In more than one dimensions, the role of the geometric discrepancy between the continuous and discrete
body is emphasized by Rosakis [7], who reduces the calculation of the energy (1) to certain lattice point prob-
lems. The asymptotic behavior of these depends on whether boundary surfaces are rational (crystallographic)
or irrational. In particular, some terms in the expansion depend on the e -sequence in the rational case, e.g.,
if W
is a smooth strictly convex
in (2), of the form ˆg ((cid:209) y, n) (Proposition
domain. The resulting expression for the surface energy density G
4.3, [7]), is discontinuous at rational values of the boundary normal n and continuous at irrational values. This
explicit form of ˆg is valid for a special choice of sequence, e k = 1/k, k ∈ Z.

is a lattice polyhedron, but not in the irrational case, for example when W

One way to eliminate the discontinuous behavior is to modify the continuous body2 for each e k = 1/k
so that the remainder R(1/k) = 0, namely its volume equals the discrete volume. This is done in a simple
geometrical way, and the result (Proposition 5.1, [7]) is an explicit and continuous surface energy density
function:

g (F, n) = −

|w · n|F (Fw)

w∈L

(4)

for any deformation gradient matrix F with det F > 0 and any unit normal vector n. However, the fact that the
continuous body now depends on e and a special sequence e k = 1/k is required is still awkward.3

Here we propose an alternative approach that eliminates the problems associated with geometric discrep-
ancy between the continuous and discrete body. Typically, one is interested in sums over the discrete body
W ∩ L, of the form

j (x) or

y (x, y).

x∈W ∩L

x∈W ∩L

y∈W ∩L

Choosing j = 1 in the ﬁrst sum gives the lattice point number #(W ∩ L) of W
the body, ff each lattice point has a unit atomic mass. The energy (1) is in the form of the second sum.

, which also equals the mass of

In general, the orientation of the lattice relative to the macroscopic (continuous) body can be determined
by methods such as x-ray crystallography; see, e.g., Zachariasen [8]. In contrast, the exact position of the
lattice relative to the body cannot be ascertained to the same degree, and perhaps it is meaningless to do so, at
least for large enough bodies. This motivates introducing the cell average of quantities deﬁned as sums over
the discrete body, such as (5). That would be the average value of the sum over all possible positions (but ﬁxed
orientation) of the lattice relative to the continuous body W
. The sums in (5) are periodic in lattice translations
L → u + L, u ∈ R3, with period the lattice cell K (deﬁned below in (7)). Thus we let the cell average of the
single sum be

j (x)du :=

−ZK
x∈W ∩(u+L)
: W → R to the whole of R3 arbitrarily, and c W

|K|ZK

x∈L

c W (x + u)j (x + u)du,

is the characteristic function of W

where we have extended j
.
The cell average of the double sum is deﬁned analogously; replace L in both sums in (5) by u + L and take
the average over u ∈ K, see (8) below. Essentially, the cell average is an ensemble average over all possible
positions of the lattice relative to the continuous body.
The advantages are immediate. For example, consider a scaled version of the single sum in (5), the Rie-
j as e → 0, but the higher order terms in its expansion in powers
mann sum e 3 (cid:229)
of e are difﬁcult to characterize explicitly for general W
, as discussed by Guillemin and Sternberg [5].
On the other hand, it is very easy to show that the cell average of the Riemann sum is exactly equal to the
for all e > 0 (see Lemma 1 below). Once averaged, the lattice point problem becomes trivial:
integral RW
1 It does not appear to be known whether such a sequence exists in more than one dimension even in simple cases, such as W

x∈W ∩e L j (x). It approachesRW

2 Given the discrete body—a ﬁnite subset D of e L—there is no unique way of choosing a region W ⊂ R3 (open set or its
closure) that contains it and no other lattice points (i.e., W ∩ e L = D). Thus W can be modiﬁed without changing D or the energy.
3 The modiﬁed continuous body has the physically desirable property that the continuum mass and the discrete mass coincide,

which is is equivalent to vanishing of the remainder (3). See Remark 10 in [7].

the cell average of the discrete volume equals the continuous volume regardless of scale, and there are no
problematic higher order terms. This is encouraging, and we study the cell average of the energy.
In Section 2 we deﬁne cell averages of single and multiple sums on the discrete body W ∩e L, in particular,
the energy (1) of a deformed crystal subject to binary interactions. In effect, this replaces one of the sums by
an integral over W
, and this is advantageous for analytical calculations. The cell average (13) of the energy
is now the integral over the continuous body (instead of the sum over the discrete body) of an energy density
that depends of ﬁnite differences of the deformation; see Corollary 2.

Section 3 contains a calculation of the continuum limit of the cell-averaged energy in case the deformation
is merely Lipschitz, so that it admits sharp phase boundaries (gradient discontinuity surfaces). In the limit we
recover the usual elastic energy, without additional interfacial energies; these are of higher order in e and we
study them later on in Section 5.
Turning to smooth deformations in Section 4, we study the term of order e in the asymptotic expansion of

the energy; this is identical to the surface energy (4) obtained by Rosakis (Proposition 5.1, [7]).

Coherent phase or twin boundaries are modelled in Section 5 as continuous deformations with piecewise
constant gradient that jumps across a plane; the interface is thus sharp. In some situations, atomic displace-
ments due to deformation twins is some crystals appear to be well described by such piecewise afﬁne defor-
mations (down to the atomic scale; an example is shown in Fig. 4(b) of Zhu, Liao & Wu [10]). This suggests
that the Cauchy-Born hypothesis may be appropriate in the case of some twin interfaces, as atoms appear to
follow an afﬁne deformation on either side of the interface, whereas near a free surface there is microscopic
relaxation from the macroscopic deformation. The energy of a piecewise afﬁne deformation contains an inter-
facial term of order e like the surface energy. In one dimension, such a term was obtained by Mora-Corral ([6]
Theorem 6). The result of cell averaging is an explicit representation of the interfacial energy (Proposition 3)
in the form

is the interface with unit normal ˆn and F ± are the limiting values of (cid:209) u (which has a jump across S )
where S
on either side of S . It is noteworthy that the interfacial energy density is expressible completely in terms of
the surface energy density g (F, n) of (4)

We remark that all of the results involving cell averages are free from any sequential depencence issues;

they are valid for an arbitrary sequence of e → 0.

The fully discrete counterparts of the aforementioned surface and interfacial energies are constructed in
Section 6. The discrete surface energy density depends of the way the continuous body is deﬁned (Rosakis
[7] Proposition 5.1). For example, if W
is a lattice polyhedron, which means that its vertices are lattice points,
the discrete surface energy differs from the cell-averaged one, while if W
is altered so at to eliminate the
geometric discrepancy (3) between the continuous and discrete volumes, the resulting surface energy equals
the cell average (Proposition 4). Such a modiﬁcation involves translating the facets of ¶W
, and is not feasible
for a planar phase boundary, which is interior to W
. The discrete interfacial energy involves a ﬁnite sum which
turns out to equal the trapezoidal approximation of an integral that appears in the corresponding cell-averaged
expression. It is then possible to deﬁne an approximating sequence of interfaces, whose Miller indices grow
unbounded as the original orientation is approached. The discrete surface and interfacial energies associated
with this sequence approach the cell average in the limit.

2 The Cell Average Approach

Let L ⊂ R3 be a simple (Bravais) lattice. If ei ∈ L form a lattice basis for L, the set

K =nx ∈ R3 : x =

3(cid:229)

i=1

ziei, 0 ≤ zi < 1o

(7)

is a lattice cell. For subsets P, Q of R3, deﬁne the Minkowski sum P ⊕ Q = {p + q : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q} and write
p + Q = {p} ⊕ Q. For e ∈ R, e P = {e x : x ∈ P}.

The continuous body is a bounded Lipschitz domain W ⊂ R3, the discrete body is W ∩ L. Consider sums
over the discrete body, of the form (5). We introduce the cell average of a sum over the discrete body. That
would be the average value of the sum over all possible positions of the lattice relative to the continuous body
W
. The sums in (5) are periodic in lattice translations L → u + L, u ∈ R3, with period the lattice cell K. Thus
we deﬁne the cell average of the single sum by (6). The cell average of the double sum is taken to be

Remark 1 This easy result is signiﬁcant, as it implies that the remainder associated with the cell-averaged
lattice point problem vanishes identically. The sequence dependence in the asymptotic expansion of the energy
is due to the remainder, so the result suggests that the cell-averaged energy might be free of this problem.
This is conﬁrmed by our results later on, for terms of order e . One can show that O(e 2) terms are sequence-
independent as well.

Remark 2 One of the two summations over W ∩e L in (1) is replaced by integration over W
. It is tempting, but
inappropriate, to perform two successive lattice-cell averages, one for each sum in (1). Instead, by translating
L to u + L in both sums concurrently and averaging over u, we are leaving bond vectors—differences between
lattice points—-invariant. Recall that the energy depends on bond vectors.

Remark 3 The averaged energy (13) has a dual continuum-discrete character. It is no longer a sum over the
discrete body, but an integral over the continuous body, of an energy density; however, prior to taking the limit,
the energy density depends on ﬁnite differences of the deformation, not derivatives, in a discrete fashion.

3 Lipschitz Deformations
In order to ensure global invertibility of y, we will always assume that for some l > 0,

|y(z) − y(x)| ≥ l |z − x| ∀x, z ∈ W

,

(14)

as in Blanc, LeBris & Lions [4]. Suppose now that all atoms in the discrete body follow a prescribed deforma-
tion which we assume to be a Lipschitz homeomorphism of the continuous body. Observe that (14) implies
that y−1 is Lipschitz as well. Hence y is bi-Lipschitz, or

y ∈ C0,1( ¯W

, R3),

y−1 ∈ C0,1(y( ¯W ), R3)

(15)

The interatomic (pair) potential is F

: R3 → R; we assume it satisﬁes the following:

F ∈ C0(R3 \ Ba(0), R),

For each a > 0,

(16)
We set F (0) = 0 to avoid having to write x 6= z in lattice sums. The scaled lattice is e L where e will approach
zero. We assume |K| = 1. If we deﬁne the stored energy function from the Cauchy-Born formula,

|z| > a, C(a) > 0, p > 0.

|F (z)| < C(a)|z|−(3+p),

for all invertible 3 × 3 matrices F, then formally at least, we immediately obtain the limit of the cell-averaged
energy to be (18) below. Proceeding more carefully, we have
Proposition 1 Suppose the deformation y is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism and the interatomic potential F
satisﬁes (16). Then the cell-averaged energy satisﬁes

Proof Because of (14) or the second of (15), |x + e w − x| < l −1|y(x + e w) − y(x)| for all e > 0 and for all

⊓⊔
Remark 4 The proof is simpler and the hypotheses on u and W weaker than those of Theorem 1 in [4]. In
particular u is merely Lipschitz, so phase boundaries are allowed, while W
is only required to be a bounded
measurable domain. On the other hand Blanc & Le Bris [3] only need y ∈ W 1,p(W ) for p > 3 and y−1 Lipschitz
to obtain the limit (18) for the discrete energy.

lime →0 (cid:229) w∈L ge , The result follows from (21), (17).

4 Smooth Deformations. Surface Energy.
In order to avoid some cumbersome technical arguments we suppose that F has ﬁnite (but otherwise arbitrary)
range. In particular, for some R > 0,

F ∈ C1(R3 \ Ba(0), R) for each a ∈ (0, R);

F (z) = 0 for |z| > R;

F (−z) = F (z) for z ∈ R3.

(22)

The last is consistent with the rotational invariance of two-body potentials.
Remark 5 All of our results can be extended to the case of inﬁnite range, provided F and its ﬁrst two deriva-
tives decay fast enough. It is cumbersome and not particularly illuminating to perform this extension.

Remark 6 The cell-averaged surface energy with density (24) is the same as in Rosakis ([7], Proposition 5.1),
but the present computation is far simpler and does not require modiﬁed domains. The cell-averaged surface
energy of Proposition 2 is valid for arbitrary sequences of e → 0.

5 Cell-Averaged Interfacial Energy of a Coherent Phase or Twin Boundary

We calculate the (cell-average of) the energy of a deformation involving a phase boundary, which we model
as a surface of discontinuity of the deformation gradient. The fully discrete energy is obtained later on in
Section 6.

Remark 7 In general, microscopy reveals that actual twinning deformations sometimes appear to be close to
piecewise afﬁne (with a sharp interface at the atomic level) and sometimes seem to be better described by a
smooth transition that extends over a few interplanar spacings. We refer to Ball and Mora-Corral [1], who
propose and study a continuum energy that allows both sharp and smooth interfaces. Here we only consider
sharp interfaces, such as the example shown in Fig. 4(b) of Zhu, Liao & Wu [10].
We suppose that W
:
x · ˆn = 0} is planar with unit normal ˆn. It separates W
: ±x · ˆn > 0} with nonempty
interiors. We let ˆy be a piecewise homogeneous deformation, which seems to describe adequately some cases

, W + ∩W −e and W − ∩W +e

Proof Consider E(w,e ) as in (25), but with ˆy from (27). Pick and ﬁx w ∈ L, and let W ±e = −e w + W ±. The
in (25) decomposes into four subdomains with disjoint interiors: W + ∩ W +e
domain of integration W ∩ W
,
W − ∩W −e
. The integrals over the ﬁrst two can be dealt with exactly as in Proposition
2, so that after summation over w ∈ L, they result in the ﬁrst two terms in (32) below. We calculate the integral
in (25) over the last two sets.
Suppose ﬁrst that w · ˆn > 0. Then W + ∩ W −e = /0, and W − ∩ W +e differs from the oblique slab ˆPe = {x ∈
Rd : x = u + sw, u ∈ S , −e ≤ s ≤ 0} by a set of volume O(e 2). The part of the integral in (25) over this set is
therefore

F (cid:18) ˆy(x + e w) − ˆy(x)

e

Z ˆPe

(cid:19)dx + O(e 2)

For x ∈ ˆPe , ˆy(x +e w) = F +(x +e w), ˆy(x) = F −x. After use of (27) and (28), since u · ˆn = 0, the argument of F
above is seen to be independent of u, and the domain ˆPe can be transformed to Pe = {x ∈ Rd : x = u + z ˆn, u ∈
S , −e w · ˆn ≤ z ≤ 0} by a simple shear. The above integral becomes
|S |Z 0
after setting z = e (t − 1)(w · ˆn), changing the integration variable to t and using (28) to ﬁnd (w · ˆn)a = (F + −
F −)w.

In case w · ˆn = 0, both ˆPe and Pe have measure zero, while the integral above vanishes. The case w · ˆn < 0
is similar and gives the negative of the above result. Combining these cases, summing over all w ∈ L, dividing
by 2 and recalling the deﬁnition (24) we arrive at (32), (31). These are trivially equivalent to (29), (30).
⊓⊔

Remark 8 Note that (29), (30) are equivalent to

¯Ee { ˆy,W } = ¯Ee {y+,W +} + ¯Ee {y−,W −} + e ZS

where y±(x) = F ±x for x ∈ W ±, respectively, and

ˆs (F +, F −, ˆn)dA + o(e ),

(32)

¯Ee {y±,W ±} = |W ±|W (F ±) + e ZW ±

g (F ±, n)dA + o(e ),

while ˆs (F +, F −, ˆn) is the interaction energy (31). Thus the total interfacial energy density s
in (30) is equal
to the sum of the surface energies of the two homogeneous deformations on either side of the interface, plus
the interaction energy ˆs . The main result here is the explicit expression for the interfacial energy (30) in terms
of the surface energies.

Remark 9 In view of (30), the interfacial energy vanishes in the trivial case F+ = F −, since the last (inter-
action) term (apart form the factor of −2) is the average of the surface energy density g (·, ˆn) over all convex
combinations of F + and F −. In view of the continuity of g (·, n), this implies that the interfacial energy ap-
proaches zero as |F+ − F−| → 0, as in a model considered by [1].

6 Discrete versus Cell-Averaged Energies

We compare cell-averaged energies with their fully discrete counterparts. Let L = Z3. A crystallographic
plane is a plane that contains at least three non-collinear lattice points.. A plane is rational if it is parallel to a
crystallographic plane. Rational planes have a Miller normal, one whose components are irreducible integers,
known as the Miller indices of the plane. We assume that W
is a convex lattice polyhedron (the convex hull
of lattice points). Then ¶W
is the union of convex lattice polygons. Each of these is part of a crystallographic
plane. As a result, ¶W

has a Miller normal ¯n ∈ M almost everywhere (except edges), where

M = { ¯n = (h, k, l) ∈ Z3 : gcd(h, k, l) = 1}

(33)

We have the following three-dimensional version of [7], Proposition 3.1 and case (a) of Proposition 5.1:

The bulk elastic energy (18) is identical in its fully discrete and cell-averaged incarnations (Theorem 1 of
Blanc, LeBris & Lions [4] and Proposition 1 above). The surface energy density g ⋄ in (34), (35) differs from
the cel-averaged version g in (24) by the additive term 1
2| ¯n|W (F). Because of this term, g ⋄(F, ·), deﬁned only
for rational normals ¯n ∈ M, cannot be continuously extended to irrational normals (Proposition 4.4 [7]). One
way to cure this pathology is part (ii) of Proposition 4, cf. Proposition 5.1in [7]. The problem is due to the
geometric discrepancy (3) between the continuous and discrete volumes, which for lattice polyhedra is of
order O(e ), the same order as the surface energy itself.

To correct this, it is possible to modify W

to correct the discrepancy; see case (ii) in Proposition 4. One
does this by exploiting the space between crystallographic planes. The distance between two adjacent such
planes with Miller normal ¯n ∈ M is 1/| ¯n|. By pushing each facet of W outwards by half that distance one
produces the augmented domain W k whose discrepancy (36) is of order higher than O(e ). The appropriate
surface energy density for this domain, in the sense of (37), is g , which is free of discontinuities. It also
coincides with the cell-averaged one (24). The reason for this coincidence is that by taking cell averages, in
effect we eliminate the geometric discrepancy as shown by Corollary 1.
Next we compute the discrete energy of a coherent phase boundary. Let the interface S be the intersection
of a crystallographic plane with W
is a
and W + ∩W − = S , so that W ± are closed convex
lattice polygon containing the origin 0 with W + ∪W − = ¯W
lattice polyhedra.
Proposition 5 Suppose W ⊂ R3 is a convex lattice polyhedron with exterior Miller normal ¯n ∈ M, S = P ∩W
where P is a crystallographic plane with Miller normal ˜n ∈ M, ˆy is given by (27) and F
satisﬁes (16). Choose
e k = 1/k, k ∈ Z and let Lk = e kL. Then the discrete (unaveraged) energy (1) satisﬁes

We postpone the proof of Proposition 5 until the end of this section.
In the one-dimensional case, the analogous interfacial energy is obtained by Mora-Corral ([6] Theorem
6). Blanc & Le Bris [3] consider a model in three dimensions where atomic interactions in an interfacial layer
of ﬁnite thickness are harmonic.
The fully discrete surface interfacial energy density with its cell-averaged counterpart appear quite differ-
ent at ﬁrst glance. The difference occurs in the interaction terms ˆt of (40) versus ˆs of (31). On the other hand,
observe that (modulo a multiplicative constant) the term in brackets is formally identical to the trapezoidal
F − F (Fw)dF over a straight path with endpoints F ±, partitioned into
|w · ˜n| subintervals. For a function f : Rn → R, a, b ∈ Rn, K ∈ Z+, the trapezoidal sum of the function f from
a to b with partition number K is

In addition, both discrete densities g ⋄(F, ·) and ˆt (F+, F −, ·) are deﬁned for rational normals. If we approxi-
mate an irrational normal by a sequence of rational ones ¯n j ∈ M, then necessarily | ¯n j| → ¥
and in this limit,
it turns out that the difference between discrete and cell averaged densities disappears. Actually, rational ori-
entations can be approximated by such sequences. This clariﬁes the connection between discrete and cell
averaged energies:
Proposition 6 Given any unit vector n ∈ S2, there is a sequence of vectors ¯n j, j ∈ Z, such that

¯n j ∈ M,

¯n j → n,

| ¯n j| → ¥

(42)

For such a sequence of Miller normals, the corresponding surface and interfacial energy densities approach
their cell-averaged counterparts in the limit as j → ¥

g ⋄(F, ¯n j) = g (F, n).

Proof If n ∈ S2 is irrational, so that there is no m ∈ M with n = m/|m|, the existence of a sequence (42) is
easy. Construct a convergent sequence of rational approximations of the components of n and multiply each
resulting vector with the least common multiple of the 3 denominators to obtain ¯n j.

in (39), (40).

If n ∈ S2 is rational, so that n = m/|m| for some m ∈ M, then there is a lattice (Z3) basis of vectors di ∈ M,
i = 1, 2, 3, such that d1 · m = d2 · m = 0, d3 · m = 1. In fact , letting bi ∈ M, i = 1, 2, 3 be the dual basis vectors,
so that bi · dk = d ik, one has m = b3. Then one may choose ¯n j = b1 + b2 + jb3 for j ∈ Z. Clearly the last two
conditions of (42) hold. To show that ¯n j ∈ M, choose p j = − jd1 + d2 + d3 ∈ Z3 and note that ¯n j · p j = 1 for
j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , so by Bezout’s Lemma, the components of ¯n j are coprime and ¯n j ∈ M.

Having established (42), replace ¯n by ¯n j in (35), and the limit in (43) is trivial by (42).
In view of (41), letting F w(F) = F (Fw), (40) can be written as

Remark 10 The reason for the convergence of discrete to cell-averaged energies in the “large Miller index”
limit (42) is related once again to the geometric discrepancy (3). One may approximate a lattice polyhedron
W by a sequence of rational polyhedra W
in
the sense of (42). Then one can show that the remainder (3) for W
j tends to zero for large j. This is related to
the fact that the interplanar spacing between crystallographic planes with Miller normal ¯n is 1/| ¯n|.

j whose facets have Miller normals that converge to those of W

If we approximate both the outside Miller normal ¯n and the interfacial one ˆn by means of large index

sequences as in (42), then the entire discrete energy (38) converges to its discrete counterpart (29).
Proof of Proposition 5. Consider the piecewise homogeneous deformation (27). Choose e k = 1/k, k ∈ Z and
let Lk = e kL, Ek = Ee k{ ˆy,W } in (1). We split the energy as follows. First we split the outer sum in (1):

Ek = E+

where in the third line, w = k(z − x), L± = {x ∈ L : ±x · ˜n ≥ 0}, L0 = {x ∈ L : x · ˜n = 0}, we have extended the
deﬁnition of ˆy in (27) to all of R3 by letting ˆy(x) = F±x for ±x · ˜n ≥ 0, x ∈ R3. Note also that F +x = F −x for
x · ˜n = 0. The last integral above is o(1/k). The sums over w ∈ L± in the third line above can be extended over
the whole of L after division by 2, the summands being even in w. The fact that the contribution of w ∈ L0 is
counted twice is rectiﬁed by the third term in brackets. The inner sums are independent of x, hence the outer
sum over x ∈ S gives a factor of #(S ∩ Lk). Since S
is a lattice polygon, it is part of a crystallographic plane
containing a two-dimensional lattice with unit cell area equal to the norm | ˜n| of the Miller normal of S , e.g.,

O((kd )−p) term in the remainder is estimated using Lemma 3.2 of [7], since F
satisﬁes (16), in the same
spirit as in the proof of Proposition 3.3 in [7]. The O(d 2/k) estimate is due to the fact the inner sum over z is
bounded, and differs from the one over Lk ∩ (Bd (x) \ W +) ∩ W − only for a set of x near S ∩ ¶W
and having
measure O(d 2), therefore containing O(d 2k) elements (then dividing by k3). The only nonzero contributions
to the sum above are from x ∈ W + with dist(x,S ) < d . Let ˆn = − ˜n/| ˜n|,

and we have used (28). The second sum differs from the one in (52) by a portion near the boundary of S of

The remainders in (52)-(54) and (56) can be rendered o(1/k) by choosing p and d = k−1+z suitably. The total
interaction energy is therefore
