Abstract

We compute the terahertz third-order nonlinear conductance of metallic armchair graphene

nanoribbons using time-dependent perturbation theory. Signiﬁcant enhancement of the intrinsic

nonlinear third-order conductance over the result for intrinsic 2D single-layer graphene is observed

over a wide range of temperatures and sample geometries. We also investigate the nonlinear

response of extrinsic metallic acGNR with |EF| ≪ 200 meV. We ﬁnd that the third-order con-
ductance exhibits a strong Fermi level dependence at low temperatures. A third-order critical

ﬁeld strength of between ∼ 1 and 5 kV/m is computed for the nonlinear Kerr terms as a func-
tion of temperature. For the third-harmonic terms, the minimum critical ﬁeld is computed to be

∼ 5 kV/m.

INTRODUCTION

Graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2D honeycomb lattice, has excellent

electronic, mechanical, thermal and optoelectronic properties.1 The spectrum of graphene is

described by the massless Dirac equation. Due to the many unique properties of graphene,

it is considered a promising material for electronic device applications.

In the terahertz (THz) to far-infrared (FIR) spectral regime, the optical conductance of

graphene based systems has attracted much interest due to the ongoing search for viable

THz devices. Graphene is traditionally a poor conductor in the THz to FIR spectrum,

with universal conductivity σ0 = e2/(4) leading to an absorption of only 2.3% at normal
incidence per graphene layer.2 However, graphene has a number of features that make it

an attractive nonlinear system to study.3–6 These include a tunable Fermi level, and more

importantly a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac point.7,8 This linear dispersion and

the accompanying constant Fermi velocity vF have led to the theoretical prediction of the

generation of higher-order harmonics in graphene.3 Mikhailov and Ziegler have developed

a quasi classical kinetic theory and a quantum theory on the third order nonlinear process

in graphene.9,10 Wright et.al.11 adopted a time dependent perturbation theory to analyse

the linear and third order nonlinear optical response of intrinsic 2D single layer graphene

(2D SLG) with an applied electric ﬁeld of approximately 100 kV/m, which indicates that

the strong nonlinear condunctance makes graphene a potential candidate for THz photonic

and optoelectronic devices. Ang et.al.12,13 investigated the nonlinear optical conductivity

of bilayer graphene (BLG), semihydrogenated graphene (SHG) and Kronig-Penney (KP)

graphene superlattices. Gullans et.al.14 studied the single photon nonlinear mechanism in

graphene nanostructures and showed strong conﬁnement of plasmons and large intrinsic non-

linearity in graphene nanostructures led to signiﬁcant electric ﬁeld enhancement. Hendry

et.al.4 ﬁrst report measurement of the coherent nonlinear optical response of single and

few-layer graphene using four-wave mixing. Their results experimentally demonstrate that

graphene structures exhibits a strong nonlinear optical response in the NIR spectral region.

Harmonic generation, frequency mixing, optical rectiﬁcation, linear and circular photogal-

vanic eﬀect, photon drag eﬀect, photoconductivity, coherently controlled ballistic charge

currents, etc.

in graphene are currently the subject of intense research, and have already

found a number of applications.6 Kumar et.al.15 found third harmonic generation in graphene

2

and multi-layer graphite ﬁlms grown by exfoliation. They found the nonlinear emission fre-

quency matched well with the theoretical prediction and deducted an eﬀective third order

susceptibility on the order of 100 µm2/kV2. Maeng et.al.16 measured the nonlinear conduc-

tivity of gate controlled graphene grown by CVD. Their work show nonlinear conductance

of graphene can be eﬃcient controlled via applied gate voltage and doping. Recently, Hafez

et.al.17 reported experimental results on the carrier dynamics in epitaxially grown mono-

layer graphene17. This work demonstrates that the microscopic mechanisms of nonlinear

eﬀects in graphene can be quite diﬀerent from their counterparts in ordinary semiconductor

systems. The large nonlinear response originating from interband transitions is eight orders

of magnitude stronger than the nonlinear response observed in dielectric materials without

such transitions. These theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the linear

energy dispersion and high electron Fermi velocity in graphene leads to a strongly nonlinear

optical response in the THz to FIR regime for various 2D graphene systems compared with

the counterparts in conventional parabolic semiconductor systems.

While the nonlinear optical properties of 2D graphene structures have been studied ex-

tensively, the nonlinear optical response, which is proportional to the higher powers of the

applied electric ﬁeld, has been much less studied for graphene nanoribbons (GNR). Duan

et.al.18 studied the linear response of intrinsic metallic armchair GNR in the infrared regime

with a linearly-polarized applied electric at low temperatures. Sasaki et.al.19 proposesd op-

tical interband transition selection rules for acGNR with linearly-polarized electric ﬁelds in

the transverse and longitudinal directions. Chung et.al.20 also investigated the interband

selction rules for acGNR. All of this work focused on the linear response of GNR and did

not address the nonlinear response of acGNR at THz frequencies for an applied linearly-

polarized electric ﬁeld in the longitudinal and transverse directions. In general, new physics

(quantization of energy, momentum etc.) emerges when the dimensionality of 2D graphene

is reduced to 1D. Depending on the nature of the edges, there are two types of GNR:

armchair graphene nanoribbons (acGNR) and the zigzag graphene nanoribbon (zzGNR).

Electron dynamics of both acGNR and zzGNR have distinct properties, due to their ge-

ometry and boundary conditions.21,22 Metallic acGNR exhibits a linear band structure in
both tight-binding23,24 and k · p models. Edge states contribute signiﬁcantly to GNR prop-
erties, since in a nanoscale GNR, massless Dirac fermions can reach the ribbon edge within

a few femtoseconds before encountering any other scattering and screening eﬀects, such as

3

electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, the Peierls instability, etc. In general,

the nonlinearity of GNR originates from the redistribution of the Dirac fermions in momen-

tum and energy space induced by the applied electric ﬁeld6. As a consequence, conductivity

components oscillating in time and space, as well as spatially homogeneous steady state com-

ponents are expected to be obtained from the resulting nonequilibrium distribution. Thus

the resulting nonlinear response is sensitive to the applied ﬁeld strength and polarization6.

Therefore, it is important to study the electrodynamics for higher order harmonic gener-

ation with the existence of an applied electric ﬁeld in GNR. In light of recent reports of

the growth of ultra thin acGNR (sub-10 nm) reported by Kimouche et.al.25 and Jacobberger

et.al.26, and the fact that Kimouche et.al.25 show that defects (kinks) do not strongly modify

the electronic structure of ultrathin acGNR, the study of the nonlinear response of these

metallic acGNR is of particular signiﬁcance today.

In this paper, we develop a semi-analytic approach based on the k · p approximation in
the Coulomb gauge to calculate the nonlinear THz response of acGNR under a moderate

applied linearly-polarized electric ﬁeld in the longitudinal and transverse directions. We

use time dependent perturbation theory to do a Fourier analysis of the wavefunction in the

presence of a strong linearly-polarized time-harmonic electric ﬁeld, and obtain the linear

and third-order optical THz response of metallic acGNR.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we begin with the k · p approximation to
obtain the time-independent wave equation and the interaction Hamiltonian with an applied

electric ﬁeld for acGNR, and we present a brief derivation of our semi-analytical approach

to calculate the nonlinear conductance. In Sec. III, we apply our model to calculate the

nonlinear conductance of metallic acGNR. In particular, we compare the nonlinear properties

of single layer metallic acGNR with those of intrinsic 2D SLG. We also propose a correction

to previous work11,27 on the third order Kerr conductance and third-harmonic conductance

in intrinsic 2D SLG. We analyze the third-order nonlinear terms, determine the required

applied electric ﬁeld strength to induce non-negligible nonlinear eﬀects and investigate the

temperature and Fermi level dependence of the nonlinear conductance. Following this, a

brief analysis of the selection rules for nonlinear direct interband transitions in metallic

acGNR is discussed. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section V.

A. H0, ψ0 and the applied ﬁeld Eµ

Graphene is a 2D hexagonal lattice (honeycomb) structure of covalently bonded carbon

atoms. As there are 2 atoms per unit cell, we label them A and B respectively. At low ener-

gies, graphene carriers can be described by the massless Dirac equation. As a consequence,

graphene shows a linear energy band structure near the Dirac points K = 2π

3, 1√3(cid:17) and
3, 1√3(cid:17) of the Brillouin zone. Here a0 is the triangular lattice parameter of the
K′ = 2π
graphene structure.21,22 (a0 = √3acc where acc is the carbon-carbon separation distance in
acGNR and acc = 1.42 ˚A)

The unperturbed k·p Hamiltonian for graphene can be written in terms of Pauli matrices
as H0,K = vF σ · k for the K valley and H0,K ′ = vF σ · k′ for the K′ valley with k(k′)
the perturbation from the center of the K(K′) valley. The corresponding wave functions
are expressed as envelope functions ψK(r) = [ψA(r), ψB(r)] and ψK ′(r) = [ψ′A(r), ψ′B(r)] for
states near the K and K′ points, respectively.

Following the development in21,22, the time-independent (unperturbed) Hamiltonian for

GNR can be written as:

and with Lx the width of acGNR in the x direction, Ly is the length of the acGNR in the y

The electronic properties of acGNR depend strongly on their width Lx.

Let us consider intrinsic, metallic acGNR under an applied ﬁeld E, of frequency ω with

normal incidence. Notice that the time dependent part of the applied ﬁeld e−iωt corresponds

to the absorption process and eiωt corresponds to the emission process. We can choose

the gauge so that the scalar potential ϕ = 0, while the vector potential A = A0e−iωt,so
that the electric ﬁeld is given by E = - ∂A
∂t = iωA = E0e−iωt, and E0 = iωA0. The
interaction with the vector potential is described by writing the canonical momentum k →
k + qA
 . In other words, the total Hamiltonian for graphene in the presence of a normally-
incident electromagnetic ﬁeld can be written as HK = vF σ · (k + qA

B. Current and σµν

In metallic acGNR, we describe the Dirac charged particle in the K and K′ valleys with en-
velope wave functions ψ(r, 0) = [ψA(r), ψB(r), ψ′A(r), ψ′B(r)]T = [hr|Ai ,hr|Bi ,hr|A′i ,hr|B′i]T .
We can then calculate the charge density as: ρ = |ψµ(r, t)|2, where the charge density oper-
ator is given by:

ρop(r) = δ(r − rop)

(5)

After applying the equation of continuity q ∂ρ
Hψµ(r, t) = i ∂ψµ(r,t)

, we obtain the current density:

with µ = x, y indicating the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld component and ν = x, y

We denote n, m, l as the quantum numbers of kx, ky and ω respectively.

In metallic

acGNR, the Fourier series expansion of ψµ(r, t) for the lowest band with an applied ˆµEµe±iωt,

is written:

We then proceed to solve the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation Hψµ(r, t) = i ∂

Due to the orthogonal properties of the basis sets {e−iωt}, we obtain the following recursion
relations for the spinor components:

(ǫ + nω)bl(m) = vF (+iky)al(m) +

For the lowest band in metallic acGNR, the energy of the carriers in the absence of applied

Following this procedure, we arrive at the following individual current density terms:

For our calculation, with an applied electric ﬁeld E = ˆµEµe−iωt, the corresponding mag-
iω e−iωt, which describes the absorption process
in the interband transistion. In what follows, we summarize the characteristics of the non-

linear conductance for all combinations of applied ﬁeld polarization and current direction.

A. Ex

If the applied electric ﬁeld E is linearly polarized along the transverse direction of the

acGNR (ˆx direction), and we investigate the metallic band where kx,n = 0, a zero current

density for the jxx and jxy components is obtained. This result implies there is neither

linear nor third-order nonlinear current in metallic acGNR when an electric ﬁeld polarized

transverse to the longitudinal direction of the nanoribbon is applied.

B. Ey

For the case where the applied electric ﬁeld E is linearly polarized along the longitudinal

direction of the acGNR (ˆy direction), we investigate the metallic band where kx,n = 0, and

arrive at the following expressions for the isotopic nonlinear conductance:

and the quantum conductance g0 = e2

4 . Due to the inversion symmetry inherent in acGNR,

the 2 nd-order current makes no contribution to the total current.

In the discussion below, we compare our results for the nonlinear conductance of metallic

acGNR with those reported by Wright, et.al.11 and Ang et.al.27 for 2D SLG. In Eq. 70 of

Ang et.al.27, they write the expression for the third-order Kerr conductance as:

2 . As both
2 and ǫ = ω contribute to the generation of the third-order Kerr current, we believe
that Eq. 25 is correct. Therefore, we compute g(3)(ω) for intrinsic 2D SLG using Eq. 25 in

ǫ = ω

what follows.

In Eq. 71 of Ang et.al.27, they write the expression for the third-order third-harmonic

Therefore, we compute g(3)(3ω) for intrinsic 2D SLG using Eq. 27 in what follows.

A thorough analysis of our objections to the Wright et.al.11 and Ang et.al. results27 are

provided in the Appendix below.

The total third-order nonlinear conductance for metallic acGNR can be expressed as:

g(3)
yν = g(3)

yν (ω)e−iωt + g(3)

yν (3ω)e−i3ωt + c.c.

(28)

This result shows that for metallic acGNR, the third-order nonlinear conductance is a super-
position of two frequency terms: (i) g(3)

yν (ω), the third-order Kerr conductance, has a single

frequency electron current density term corresponding to the absorption of two photons and
the simultaneous emission of one photon; and (ii), g(3)

yν (3ω), the third-harmonic conductance

term corresponding to the simultaneous absorption of three photons. The complex conjugate

parts in Eq. 28 are for the emission process.

In this paper we consider the case where the length of the ribbon Ly → ∞, and as a
result, we have a quasi continuum of states for the linear bands near the Dirac points in

metallic acGNR. To simplify the discussion, we present results for acGNR20, the armchair

graphene nanoribbon N = 20 atoms wide. The frequency dependent nonlinear conductance
in units of g0 = e2

4 for intrinsic acGNR20, calculated assuming an applied ﬁeld strength
of 10 kV/m, is plotted in Fig. 2, together with the third-order Kerr conductance of 2D

SLG. Both nonlinear terms for intrinsic metallic acGNR20 and 2D SLG decrease rapidly

with frequency. The huge nonlinearities at lower frequencies are associated with the strong
interaction of carriers with low energy photons. The third-order Kerr conductance, g(3)

yν (ω)

for acGNR20 is approximately three orders of magnitude larger than that for 2D SLG. The

exact enhancement factor for nonlinear conductances in metallic acGNR is a function of the

nanoribbon width, and from Eqs. 21, 22 is determined to be vF /ωLx. Due to the thermal
factor cancellation in the expression for the nonlinear third-harmonic conductance, g(3)
tends to be much less than g(3)

yν (ω). When T = 0 K, the third-harmonic conductance is zero

yν (3ω)

for intrinsic acGNR20. For T = 300 K, the third-harmonic conductance is of the same order

as for 2D SLG.

In Fig. 3, we illustrate the temperature and width dependence of the third-order non-

linear conductance for intrinsic metallic acGNR and 2D SLG for an excitation frequency of
1 THz and an applied ﬁeld strength of 10 kV/m. In Figs. 3a and 3b, g(3)
decrease monotonically with temperature T . However, g(3)

yν (3ω) is initially zero at T = 0 K

yν (ω) is shown to

11

and increases to its maximum value (∼ 2 orders of magnitude above that for 2D SLG) at ap-
proximately T = 17 K (the exact location of the maximum is a function of the thermal factor

appearing in the expressions for the conductance). It then decreases at a faster rate then
g(3)
yν (ω) for T > 17 K. The rate of decrease with temperature for g(3)

yν (ω) is approximately

the same as for 2D SLG.

In Figs. 3c and 3d we see that both third-order nonlinear conductance components are

inversely proportional to the width of the acGNR Lx. This dependence of the conductance

on Lx is due to the unitless factor vF /ωLx in Eqs. 21, 22, which implies that the total

quasi-1D nonlinear current is constant and invariant of the nanoribbon width. We see that
for Lx ≃ 100 nm, or acGNR800, g(3)
frequency of 1 THz, which again suggests that metallic acGNR manifests a much stronger
Kerr conductance g(3)

yν (ω) than 2D SLG over a wide range of widths. These ﬁndings suggest

yν (ω) is still greater than that of 2D SLG for an excitation

that metallic acGNR of submicron width is a better candidate than 2D SLG for nonlinear

THz device applications.

In order to evaluate the frequency-conversion device potential of metallic acGNR, we

deﬁne a critical ﬁeld strength E(3)
c,yν(ω, T ) as the ﬁeld strength when the nonlinear conduc-
tance dominates over the linear conductance (|g(3)
yν |/g0 > 1 where g0 = e2/4). In Fig. 4 we
plot the temperature dependence of the critical ﬁeld strength for intrinsic metallic acGNR

assuming a 1 THz excitation frequency. Fig. 4a illustrates the change in critical ﬁeld as a

function of temperature for both intrinsic metallic acGNR and 2D SLG. Due to the thermal
factor cancellation, at low temperatures, the third-order conductance g(3)

yν (3ω) for acGNR20

exhibits a larger critical ﬁeld strength than 2D SLG. As the thermal distribution broadens

with increasing T , the critical strength drops to 10% of the critical ﬁeld strength for 2D
SLG. As the temperature rises further, E(3)
SLG near T = 170 K again. For the Kerr conductance term, the critical ﬁeld E(3)
c,yν(ω, T ),
increases as temperature increases, but it stays ∼ 1 order of magnitude below the critical
ﬁeld for 2D SLG. Further, the relatively small change in critical ﬁeld for g(3)
yν (ω) from T =

c,yν(3ω, T ) increases until it rises above that for 2D

0 K to T = 300 K indicates that metallic acGNR should exhibit excellent frequency conver-

sion eﬃciencies for the optical Kerr process. The small values of the critical ﬁeld exhibited

by metallic acGNR for both Kerr and third-harmonic nonlinearities suggest that these ma-

terials will be excellent for use in the fabrication of nonlinear optical frequency-conversion

devices

12

In Figs. 5 and 6 we study the Kerr g(3)

yν (ω) and third-harmonic g(3)

yν (3ω) conductances

as a function of the Fermi level EF (since the behavior of the system is symmetric for

EF about EF = 0 in Figs. 5a and 6a, we only plot results for positive EF ). For EF
well below the optical phonon energy (∼ 200 meV), we plot the Fermi-level dependence of
yν (ω) and g(3)
g(3)
yν (3ω) assuming a 1 THz excitation at T = 0 K and T = 300 K. Perhaps

the most important observations are for the 0 K case. We see three critical frequencies for

EF /h: 0.5 THz, 1 THz and 1.5 THz. These frequencies correspond to turning oﬀ the thermal
distribution at ω/2, ω and 3ω/2. We note that g(3)

yν (3ω) is nonzero over the ω/2 to 3ω/2

doping window. In this window, only the ω term in the thermal factor N(ω) contributes
to the g(3)
greatly enhance g(3)

yν (3ω). But the enhancement we observe at low temperature for g(3)

yν (3ω) transition. This result suggests that at low temperatures, light doping will

yν (3ω)

disappears near room temperature. Also, the curves for diﬀerent values of EF asymptotically

approach the intrinsic acGNR conductance, as the temperature increases.

In Fig. 7, we compare the conductances g(3)

yν (ω) and g(3)

yν (3ω) of extrinsic acGNR20

(EF /h = 0.7 THz) for diﬀerent temperatures and with the corresponding values for in-

trinsic 2D SLG. For the T = 0 K case, we observe a sharp onset for both the isotropic and

anisoropic Kerr conductances at EF /h = 0.7 THz and a further increase at EF /h = 1.4 THz

for the isotropic Kerr conductance. These changes are due to diﬀerent terms in the thermal

factor turning on at these excitation frequencies (see Table I).

The third-harmonic result is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at T = 0 K.

In this case the con-

ductance turns on abruptly at EF = 2ω/3 (f = 0.467 THz) and turns oﬀ abruptly at

EF = 3ω/2 (f = 1.4 THz). These changes are also due to the relevant terms in the thermal

factor turning on at particular excitation frequencies (see Table I).

For T = 300 K, we note that the extrinsic Kerr conductance is strongly enhanced over

intrinsic 2D SLG, as it is in the intrinsic case. Further, the extrinsic third-harmonic con-

ductance is of the same order as the 2D SLG nonlinear Kerr conductance value. Comparing

the isotropic conductances with their anisotropic counterparts, we note similar behavior at

T = 300 K. These results indicate that for low temperatures, there is a strong enhancement

of the third-harmonic nonlinearity; however at room temperature, the Kerr nonlinearity

dominates.

Finally, it is worth noting the limitations of our approach. The singularity around the

Dirac point in metallic acGNR leads to high mobility, but acGNR can be more prone to edge

defects. Furthermore the k· p approximation is appropriate only at low energies, well below
energies of the order of 2 eV.28 For Fermi energies at this scale, one needs to use a more basic

tight-binding description, and the Dirac physics becomes largely irrelevant. For undoped

and lightly-doped acGNR, the Fermi energy is well away from these energy scales and the

description in terms of the Dirac Hamiltonian should work relatively well. In this paper, we

assume the length of illumination is small compared to the typical THz wavelength, so that

we may treat the spatial electric ﬁeld distribution as a constant over the entire illumination

length. Further, we treat the metallic acGNR with no applied longitudinal bias voltage, so

that the Fermi level does not change across the longtitudinal direction of the nanoribbon. It

will be important to introduce additional eﬀects in the present model such as the ﬁnite extent

of the excitation ﬁeld and the ﬁnite longitudinal size of the nanoribbon, as well as material

eﬀects such as electron-electron, electron-phonon interactions, and other edge eﬀects. These

topics are the subject of our future work.

IV. SELECTION RULES RELATED TO ACGNR

In this section, we discuss the applicability of well-known selection rules for acGNR and

2D SLG to the problem of nonlinear harmonic generation in metallic acGNR. We focus on

the interband transition in the lowest (linear) band (n = 0). The fact that we have nonzero

Jyy and zero Jxx is consistent with the selection rules for acGNR19,20 found by Sasaki et.al.

and HC Chung et.al.

In general, for 2D SLG there is no current in the Jyx and Jxy directions. The current

density for intrinsic 2D SLG can be written:

current in 2D SLG results from that fact that the net sum is zero over all possible angles.

because R 2π

However, as shown above for metallic acGNR, Jyν, σ(i)

µν (m, ω) has the general form:

σ(i)
yν (m, ω) = F (i)

yν (|ky|) cos(θkn,ky)

(30)

For metallic acGNR, we no longer integrate all possible angles as we did for 2D SLG. Due

to the 1D nature of acGNR, we only have θkn,ky = 0, π depending on the sign of ky, and

thus we only evaluate at two angles according to the initial condition given by Eq. 4 when

we evaluate the total current density Jyν for metallic acGNR. As a result, Jyν is not always
zero for all EF , ω and T . For direct interband transitions between states where kx,n 6= 0,
we make a similiar argument as we only require states at ǫ = vF kx,n csc(θkn,ky) to be at
resonance. Thus, we only have the θkn,ky and π − θkn,ky pair as the two solutions. In this
way, we extend the selection rules of the direct interband transition for acGNR to the Jyx

15

case, i.e. kx,n does not change from initial state to ﬁnal state. This is the same requirement

as for Jyy in acGNR.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Kimouche et.al.25 and Jacobberger et.al.26 have succesfully fabricated ultrathin acGNR

with widths Lx < 10 nm. Our calculation of the nonlinear conductance in acGNR suggest

that experimental meansurements of the THz nonlinear response in thin metallic acGNR

should be measurable at relatively low excitation ﬁeld strengths. The relatively small crit-

ical ﬁeld strength at room temperature implies that thin metallic acGNR have signiﬁcant

potential for nonlinear device applications. The striking turn on and turn oﬀ of the third-

order harmonics with small changes in Fermi level at low temperatures suggest that metallic

acGNR could be the the basis for developing a sensitive graphene-based low temperature

detector or oscillator.

In this paper, we have modeled the third-order THz response of metallic acGNR using a

nonlinear semi-analytical approach. The time-dependent Dirac equation for massless Dirac

Fermions is solved via the Fourier expansion method. We have shown intrinsic metallic

acGNR exhibits strong nonlinear eﬀects from the THz to the FIR regime under applied

electric ﬁeld amplitudes less than 10 kV/m. We also describe the behavior of these nonlin-

earities for extrinsic, metallic acGNR. Under certain conditions, metallic acGNR will exhibit

a larger nonlinear conductance, require less applied electric ﬁeld strength to generate mod-

erate strong high harmonics and show better temperature stability than intrinsic 2D SLG.

This opens the potential for use in many device applications for intrinsic and slightly doping

metallic acGNR.

also be symmetric in (a1, a2). Thus, both ω/2 and ω terms must appear in the expression

for the Kerr conductance, Eq. 43.
