ABSTRACT

We present the galaxy luminosity function (LF) of the Abell 119 cluster down to Mr ∼ −14 mag
based on deep images in the u-, g-, and r-bands taken by using MOSAIC II CCD mounted on the
Blanco 4m telescope at the CTIO. The cluster membership was accurately determined based on the
radial velocity information as well as on the color-magnitude relation for bright galaxies and the
scaling relation for faint galaxies. The overall LF exhibits a bimodal behavior with a distinct dip at
r ∼ 18.5 mag (Mr ∼ −17.8 mag), which is more appropriately described by a two-component function.
The shape of the LF strongly depends on the cluster-centric distance and on the local galaxy density.
The LF of galaxies in the outer, low-density region exhibits a steeper slope and more prominent
dip compared with that of counterparts in the inner, high-density region. We found evidence for
a substructure in the projected galaxy distribution in which several overdense regions in the Abell
119 cluster appear to be closely associated with the surrounding, possible ﬁlamentary structure. The
combined LF of the overdense regions exhibits a two-component function with a distinct dip, while
the LF of the central region is well described by a single Schechter function. We suggest that, in the
context of the hierarchical cluster formation scenario, the observed overdense regions are the relics of
galaxy groups, retaining their two-component LFs with a dip, which acquired their shapes through
galaxy merging process in group environments, before they fall into a cluster.

1. INTRODUCTION

According to the hierarchical structure formation
models in the Λ cold dark matter cosmology, clus-
ters of galaxies have been built-up as a result of in-
fall of galaxies and galaxy groups along ﬁlaments into
a cluster and their subsequent merging (West et al.
1995; Faltenbacher et al. 2005; Colberg et al. 2005;
Berrier et al. 2009). Once the galaxies are conﬁned
to a cluster, they are continuously aﬀected by vari-
ous environmental processes, such as the ram pressure,
harassment, and tidal
interaction (Byrd & Valtonen
1990; Park & Hwang 2009; Moore et al. 1996, 1998;
Moss & Whittle 2000; Gnedin 2003; Boselli & Gavazzi
2006; Boselli et al. 2008). On the other hand, the galax-
ies in a group may have already evolved before the
group is assembled into a cluster (i.e., preprocessing;
Zabludoﬀ & Mulchaey 1998; Fujita 2004; McGee et al.
2009; De Lucia et al. 2012; Dressler et al. 2013). An in-
vestigation of the properties and evolution of galaxies in
the smaller, local-scale structures of galaxy groups can
provide insights into the formation and aggregation of
the larger, global-scale structures of galaxy clusters.

For understanding the formation history and evolu-
tion of the galaxies in galaxy clusters, the galaxy lu-
minosity function (LF) is a powerful tool for describ-
ing the fundamental properties of galaxies. In the early
studies, a single Schechter function was suggested as an
analytic form to describe the “universal” LF of galax-
ies in clusters (Schechter 1976) and ﬁeld environment
(Madgwick et al. 2002; Blanton et al. 2005). However,
by using deep and accurate photometry of galaxies, it has
been revealed that the LFs of galaxies in many clusters
possess more complex features, such as dips at interme-
diate luminosities and excess of faint galaxies, making a
two-component LF a better ﬁt to the observed data (e.g.,
Popesso et al. 2006; Mercurio et al. 2006; Ba˜nados et al.
2010; Liu et al. 2011; Yamanoi et al. 2012). Moreover,
it has been suggested that the LF shape varies with the
environment even within a single cluster, providing in-
formation on the formation and subsequent evolution of
galaxies depending on the cluster environmental eﬀects
(Mercurio et al. 2006; Popesso et al. 2006).

Because variations in the galaxy LF are related to the
cluster evolutionary state, the LFs of dynamically young
and unrelaxed clusters are the best indicators for study-
ing the ongoing assembly of galaxy clusters. According
to the hierarchical structure formation scenario, the pres-
ence of substructures in a cluster is a signature of clus-
ter formation processes. An indication of LF variations
across the cluster substructures was found as the LFs of
the substructures exhibit diﬀerent shapes, depending on
their dynamical state (e.g., Yang et al. 2004; Zhang et al.
2011). Except for a few studies, a detailed investigation
on the LFs of dynamically young clusters has not received
proper attention.

2

Lee et al.

In this study, we chose the galaxy cluster Abell 119
to further investigate the galaxy LFs in young clus-
ters, by examining in particular the LF variation as
a function of diﬀerent local densities and regions in
the cluster. The Abell 119 cluster is a nearby (z ∼
0.044), rich cluster of galaxies with a velocity disper-
sion of σv ∼ 800 km s−1 (Melnick & Quintana 1981;
Fadda et al. 1996; Katgert et al. 1996; Valentinuzzi et al.
2011).
It has been suggested that the Abell 119
cluster is a dynamically complex cluster with sev-
eral substructures in the galaxy distribution and the
X-ray surface brightness proﬁle (Fabricant et al. 1993;
Kriessler & Beers 1997; Ramella et al. 2007; Tian et al.
2012). The X-ray data reveal interesting features, such
as the positional oﬀset of 36 arcsec between the X-ray
and optical peaks, X-ray distribution elongated in the
North-East direction, and no indication of an inward
cooling ﬂow (Fabricant et al. 1993; Peres et al. 1998;
Rossetti & Molendi 2010).
In addition, radio obser-
vations detected two radio galaxies with narrow-angle
tails, which might be associated with recent or on-
going merger activities between the cluster and sub-
clusters (Bliton et al. 1998; Feretti et al. 1999). Con-
sequently, many observational results suggest that the
Abell 119 cluster is an example for a dynamically com-
plex, young system (Edge et al. 1990; Vikhlinin et al.
2009; Rossetti & Molendi 2010).

In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the LF of
the Abell 119 cluster, based on a statistically signiﬁcant
sample of member galaxies, constructed from MOSAIC
II CCD observations by using the Blanco 4m telescope at
the CTIO. This paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we describe the observations and the data reduction
process. To construct an accurate LF, we performed the
detection completeness. We also selected cluster mem-
ber galaxies based on the radial velocity information as
well as on the color-magnitude relation for bright galaxies
and the scaling relation for faint galaxies. In Section 3,
we analyze the overall cluster LF and the environmental
dependence of the LFs of galaxies within the Abell 119
cluster. The large-scale spatial distribution of galaxies in
the cluster and the LFs of overdense regions are also ex-
plored. Finally, Section 4 contains the discussion on the
bimodal LFs of dynamically young clusters constraining
the assembly history of galaxy clusters.

2. DATA AND ANALYSIS

2.1. Data

Our investigation makes use of the imaging and the
integrated photometric data of Sheen et al. (2012). As a
part of the survey of galaxies in the nearby, rich Abell
clusters, u-, g-, and r-band deep images of galaxies in
the Abell 119 cluster were taken by using the MOSAIC
II CCD that was mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at
the CTIO (see Sheen et al. 2012 for details). The overall
dimension of the MOSAIC II CCD is 8K × 8K pixels with
the pixel scale of 0.24′′ pixel−1, which corresponds to the
36 × 36 arcmin2 ﬁeld of view. The images are based on a
single MOSAIC II pointing combined from more than ﬁve
dither positions in each ﬁlter (see Table 1 of Sheen et al.
(2012)). The total exposure times of the images were
6000, 5760, and 5760 seconds for the u-, g-, and r-band,
respectively. The average seeing was under 1 arcsec.

After performing basic pre-processings and ﬂux calibra-
tion with standard stars in CDF-S (Smith et al. 2003),
the optical integrated magnitudes of the galaxies were
measured in the AB magnitude system using SExtractor
(Bertin & Arnouts 1996). Objects with CLASS STAR ≤
0.8 from our sample were selected as galaxies. Galactic
foreground extinction was corrected using the reddening
maps from Schlegel et al. (1998). See Sheen et al. (2012)
for more details on the observations, data reduction, and
integrated photometry. For the rest of the analysis in
this paper we used the distance modulus of 36.30, which
is obtained from our radial velocity distribution of galax-
ies by assuming H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1 (see Section 2.3
for details). We also adopted the location of UGC 579
(R.A. (J2000) = 00h 56m 16.1s, Decl. (J2000) = -01◦
15′ 19.1′′) as the cluster center of Abell 119.

2.2. Surface Photometry and Photometric Completeness
For the surface photometry of our sample galaxies, we
cropped the r-band image around each galaxy. All of the
objects detected by the SExtractor, except the galaxy it-
self, were masked using the segmentation image, follow-
ing which the SExtractor was performed again on the
masked image. The background subtracted image was
constructed using the background map returned from
the SExtractor. We determined the surface brightness
proﬁles of our galaxies using the ELLIPSE task in the
IRAF. We ﬁxed the center of the isophote to the one
measured by the SExtractor and set the position angle
and ellipticity as the free parameters.

We ﬁtted the radial surface brightness proﬁles by
the S´ersic functions, using the following equation
(Graham & Driver 2005).

µ(R) = µ0 +

2.5

ln(10) (cid:18) R

h(cid:19)1/n

,

(1)

where µ0 is the central surface brightness and n is the
S´ersic index. The parameter h is the scale-length that
is related to the eﬀective radius (Re) as Re = bnh, with
b = 1.9992n−0.3271 for 0.5 < n < 10 (Graham & Driver
2005). The ﬁtting was performed using the IDL routines
in the MPFIT package (Markwardt 2009). To minimize
the seeing eﬀects, the inner (<1 arcsec) region was ex-
cluded from the ﬁtting. Furthermore, the data points
below the +1σ deviation of the background level were
excluded as well.
In Figure 1, we present examples of
the S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting for a bright (left panel) and a
faint (right panel) galaxy, where the solid curves are the
best-ﬁt S´ersic models.

To study the galaxy LF, completeness corrections have
to be applied to the observed number counts of galax-
ies. To estimate the completeness, we generated 10000
artiﬁcial galaxies by adopting the structural parameters
obtained from the surface photometry of the observed
galaxies. Figure 2 (top panel) shows the r-band central
surface brightness (µ0) and the r-band magnitude (r) of
the objects that were observed in the Abell 119 cluster
(gray dots). The µ0 was obtained from the best-ﬁt S´ersic
model. To construct the artiﬁcial galaxies, ﬁrst, µ0 and r
were randomly selected following the parameter ranges of
the observed galaxies (see red dashed box in the top panel
of Fig.
2). The S´ersic indices (n) were also randomly
selected in the range of 0.5 < n < 4 (Balcells et al. 2007;

of a bright (left panel) and a faint (right panel) galaxy. Red ﬁlled
circles indicate the data used for the S´ersic ﬁt. Blue open circles are
the data points excluded from the ﬁtting; these points are located

the root mean square (rms) deviation of the surface brightness for
each isophote.

Graham & Worley 2008). The eﬀective radii of the arti-
ﬁcial galaxies were calculated with the selected µ0, r, and
n, using the equations of Graham & Driver (2005). Two
hundred ﬁfty out of the 10000 artiﬁcial galaxies were ran-
domly distributed in the observed image and then were
searched and measured using the SExtractor with the
same conﬁguration parameters as those that were used
in our original photometry. This procedure was repeated
for 40 times.

We calculated the detection rate of the artiﬁcial galax-
ies as a function of magnitude (the bottom panel of
Fig. 2). In general, the completeness decreases with the
magnitude (red solid line for the total sample). More
than 80% of the simulated galaxies at r < 22 mag were
recovered by the SExtractor. However, there is signif-
icant incompleteness regarding faint galaxies dropping
below 50% for r > 24 mag. A completeness correction
for the faint galaxies might result in an inaccurate LF
slope. Therefore, we restricted the sample to the galax-
ies with r < 22 mag for the analysis of LFs in the Abell
119 cluster. To examine the spatial variation of the com-
pleteness, we also calculated the detection rate for the
inner (<0.2 deg, blue dotted line) and outer (>0.2 deg,
black dashed line) regions of the cluster. While the com-
pleteness of the inner region appears to be slightly lower
than that of the outer region at faint magnitudes, no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between them was found within the
errors (0.02 ± 0.03% for the mean), implying no severe
spatial dependence of the completeness.

2.3. Membership of galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster
For an accurate derivation of the LF,

it is impor-
tant to deﬁne the cluster membership of galaxies. Al-
though radial velocity information from spectroscopic ob-
servations can be directly used to separate the cluster
members from the background galaxies, this is gener-
ally limited to bright galaxies with high surface bright-
ness. Alternatively, many studies have used a statisti-
cal subtraction of the foreground/background galaxies
based on the galaxy counts in the nearby or blank re-

tion in the LF (Barrena et al. 2012; Pracy et al. 2005;
Popesso et al. 2006). However, this statistical method
is hampered by the density ﬂuctuation around the clus-
ter (e.g., Hradecky et al. 2000). This eﬀect is likely to
be more severe in dynamically young clusters with sub-
structures as well as at the intersections of ﬁlaments
such as the Abell 119 cluster (Fabricant et al. 1993;
Kriessler & Beers 1997; Ramella et al. 2007; Tian et al.
2012, see also Section 3.3).

the
background galaxies with high surface brightness can
be separated from the cluster member galaxies with
low surface brightness. Chiboucas et al. (2010) tested
the success rate for determining the membership of
the Coma cluster galaxies by using scaling relations,
and concluded that this method is reliable even for
faint, low surface brightness galaxies. Here we consider
the available radial velocity information as well as
the color-magnitude relation for bright (r < 19 mag)
galaxies in combination with the scaling relation for
faint galaxies (r > 19 mag), for the selection of the
member galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster.

2.3.1. Bright Galaxies

To determine the spectroscopic membership of bright
galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster, we have collected the

4

Lee et al.

data on the radial velocities of 193 galaxies from the
SDSS DR9 (Ahn et al. 2012). To complete the data for
the galaxies for which radial velocities were not measured
in the SDSS, we added additional 187 galaxies from the
independent spectroscopic measurements available in the
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) and from
previous studies of the Abell 119 cluster (Fabricant et al.
1993; Katgert et al. 1998; Rines et al. 2003; Smith et al.
2004; Cava et al. 2009). Overall, we secured 380 galax-
ies with known radial velocities. These galaxies cover the
magnitude range of 13.6 mag < r < 24.6 mag. To test the
consistency between the SDSS and other data, we exam-
ined the radial velocities of 116 galaxies for which we had
two or more independent radial velocity measurements.
The mean diﬀerence (25 km s−1) between the measured
radial velocities was negligible, within the standard de-
viation (52 km s−1).

Our compiled bright galaxies with available spectro-
scopic radial velocity information are not biased to-
wards a targeted cluster selection. Out of 281 bright
(r < 19 mag) galaxies with spectroscopic data, 137 galax-
ies (∼49%) are from the SDSS in which selected galaxies
are randomly sampled. One hundred thirty-one galaxies
(∼47%) are from Cava et al. (2009). They also selected
a random sample with V < 21.5 mag and B − V < 1.4
mag (i.e., g − r < 1.3 mag) to avoid any bias in the ob-
served morphological type (See section 2 of Cava et al.
2009). Therefore, the majority (∼96%) of our bright
sample galaxies with spectroscopic data are randomly
selected ones without any systematic bias.

The membership assignment of bright galaxies with ra-
dial velocities was accomplished in several steps. First,
the distribution of radial velocities was ﬁtted with a
Gaussian function (black dashed curve in the left panel
of Figure 3), following which the systemic velocity (vsys)
and the velocity dispersion (σv) of the cluster were de-
termined. The virial radius (r200) of the cluster was then
calculated using the equation given by Carlberg et al.
(1997):

√3σv
10H0

r200 =

,

(2)

where the H0 is 73 km s−1 Mpc−1. Second, we exam-
ined the radial velocity distribution as a function of the
cluster-centric distance (right panel of Fig. 3).
In this
distribution, we overplotted a spherical symmetric in-
fall model (solid curves in the right panel of Fig. 3)
using the measured σv and r200 (Praton & Schneider
1994). The infall model encompasses all galaxies in a
cluster whose infall motion is decoupled from the Hub-
ble ﬂow. Only galaxies that were bounded by the in-
fall model lines were selected. Furthermore, the galax-
ies with radial velocities larger than 3σv away from the
vsys (dotted lines in Fig. 3) were also rejected and the
process was repeated iteratively until ensuring conver-
gence. Finally, 193 and 187 out of 380 galaxies were de-
ﬁned as spectroscopic members (Mspec) and background
galaxies (Bspec), respectively. Most spectroscopic mem-
ber galaxies cover a relatively bright magnitude range of
13.6 mag < r < 19.3 mag (see also Figure 4a). Us-
ing the selected sample of Mspec , the ﬁnal values of
vsys, σv, and r200 were determined as 13 319 km s−1,
853 km s−1, and 2.0 Mpc (i.e., 0.63 deg), respectively.

dial velocities of the galaxies as a function of the cluster-centric dis-

are marked by the red ﬁlled circles and blue crosses, respectively.
The background (178) and forground (4) galaxies with large or
small radial velocities were not captured by this plot. The black
solid lines are the caustic curves of the infall model, and the hor-
izontal dotted lines delineate the region of ±3σv away from the
vsys.

The derived vsys and σv are in good agreement with the
previously obtained values (e.g., Fabricant et al. 1993;
Tian et al. 2012). However, our σv is diﬀerent from that
(618 km s−1) reported by Sheen et al. (2012) which was
measured using a bright galaxy sample with Mr < −20
mag. The corresponding distance and distance modulus
of the Abell 119 cluster are 182 Mpc and m− M = 36.30
mag, respectively, consistent with the previously re-
ported values (Melnick & Quintana 1981; Katgert et al.
1996; Valentinuzzi et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2012).

To further determine the membership of bright galax-
ies without available radial velocities (e.g., gray dots in
Figure 4a), we relied on the color-magnitude distribu-
tion of galaxies (Figure 4a). The red sequence (black
solid line) was determined by the linear least square ﬁt-
ting and by the sigma clipping method applied to the
sample of Mspec (red ﬁlled circles):

g − r = −0.030(±0.001)r + 1.234(±0.0237).

(3)

First of all, we rejected galaxies that are redward of
the red sequence (i.e., larger than three times the av-
erage color dispersion of the red sequence, see up-
per dashed line in Fig. 4a), because there is a lack
of cluster member galaxies signiﬁcantly redward of the
red sequence (e.g., Gladders & Yee 2000; Muzzin et al.
2008; Rines & Geller 2008; Lu et al. 2009; Barrena et al.
2012). We considered bright galaxies that are bluer than
this upper red sequence envelope as possible cluster mem-
ber candidates (hereafter Cphot).

We estimated a correction factor that indicates how
many Cphot galaxies without available radial velocities
are true member galaxies (Adami et al. 2007; Yoon et al.
2008). For this, we deﬁned Cspec and Cnonspec as the
galaxies with and without radial velocities respectively,
that are within our selection boundaries (i.e., Cnonspec
= Cphot− Cspec). For a given magnitude, we deﬁned the
correction factor as the ratio of the number of spectro-
scopically conﬁrmed cluster members among the Cspec

Luminosity Function of Abell 119

galaxies to the number of all Cspec galaxies (red solid
curve in Fig. 4b). This ratio gradually decreases from
r ∼ 16 mag faintward, with most Cspec galaxies brighter
than this magnitude being the cluster members. There-
fore, at each magnitude bin, a correction factor can be
applied to the number of Cnonspec galaxies (gray dashed
curve in Fig. 4b) to estimate the fraction of possible
member galaxies among them. Note that we applied this
correction factor only to the bright galaxies with r < 19
mag (vertical dashed line in Fig. 4), because the spec-
troscopic coverage of fainter galaxies drops below 40%,
providing less statistical meaning.

Note that there are a few spectroscopic member galax-
ies with colors redder than the upper red sequence en-
velope in the color-magnitude diagram (see ﬁve galax-
ies brighter than r = 19 mag in Fig. 4(a)). To ac-
count for them, we need to estimate an additional sta-
tistical correction factor that indicates how many galax-
ies with colors redder than this envelope are true mem-
ber galaxies. For this, we considered bright (r < 19
mag) galaxies without available radial velocities, that
are redder than the upper red sequence envelope (here-
after Cnonspec,red). We deﬁned the correction factor
as the ratio of Mspec,red/Cspec,red, where Mspec,red and
Cspec,red are spectroscopic member galaxies and galaxies
with radial velocities, respectively, that are both above
the upper red sequence envelope. For a given magni-
tude bin, this correction factor was applied to the num-
ber of Cnonspec,red galaxies for the number of possible
member galaxies among them. Finally, we obtained 0,
0.6, and 3.1 possible member galaxies for the magnitude
bins of r < 17 mag, 17 mag < r < 18 mag, and 18
mag < r < 19 mag, respectively. To construct the LF
for the bright galaxies, the corrections for Cnonspec and
Cnonspec,red were added to the number Mspec of member
galaxies for each magnitude bin.

2.3.2. Faint Galaxies

The majority of low-luminosity galaxies with low sur-
face brightness exhibit exponential radial proﬁles and
follow a well-known correlation between the central
surface brightness and magnitude (Binggeli et al. 1984;
Ferguson & Sandage 1988; Ferguson 1989). This scal-
ing relation allows to discriminate faint cluster mem-
bers from background galaxies when the no radial
velocity information is available (Karick et al. 2003;
Hilker et al. 2003; Mieske et al. 2007; Rines & Geller
2008; Chiboucas et al. 2010; Boselli et al. 2011). For
a given magnitude, background galaxies have higher
central surface brightness than the cluster members.
In previous studies, this method of membership deter-
mination for faint galaxies was conﬁrmed as reliable,
compared with the direct spectroscopic method (e.g.,
Rines & Geller 2008; Chiboucas et al. 2010).

In Figure 5, we show the peak surface brightness
(µMax) obtained from the SExtractor vs.
the r-band
magnitude of galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster. The
µMax is deﬁned as the surface brightness of the bright-
est pixel in the center of a galaxy (Bertin & Arnouts
1996), which is comparable to the central surface bright-
ness. For reducing the contamination of our sample,
we only considered those galaxies that are blueward
of the +3σ deviation from the red sequence in the
color-magnitude relation (gray dots in Fig. 5). The

ground (Bspec) galaxies, respectively. The gray dots are the galax-

gray dashed curve is for the trend of Cnonspec, which are Cphot
galaxies without radial velocities. The actual number of Cnonspec
galaxies for each magnitude bin is also indicated. Spectroscopic
incompleteness is corrected only for galaxies with r < 19 mag (see
the vertical dashed line).

shape of the scaling relation strongly depends on the
deﬁnition of the adopted surface brightness parameter
(Graham & Guzm´an 2003).
In the case of using the
central surface brightness, the scaling relation presents
a linear relation (see Fig. 12 of Graham & Guzm´an
2003). Therefore, with spectroscopically conﬁrmed mem-
bers in the range of 17 mag < r < 19 mag (−19.3 mag
< Mr < −17.3 mag), a robust least square ﬁtting was
performed in the plane of µMax and r (thin dashed line
in Fig. 5). The +1σ deviation from this relation de-
ﬁnes our upper boundary to properly cover most spec-
troscopic member galaxies (black solid line in Fig. 5).
This sequence separates the possible members (occupy-
ing the region below the black solid line in Fig. 5) from
the background galaxies (above the black solid line in
Fig. 5) in the faint galaxy sample with r > 19 mag.

Distinguishing between member galaxies and back-
ground objects becomes somewhat diﬃcult at faint mag-
nitudes, because the surface brightness measurements
are mainly aﬀected by the spatial resolution of the data
(Karick et al. 2003). In our case, a fraction (30%, 22 of
74) of spectroscopically conﬁrmed background galaxies
(blue crosses in Fig. 5) in the range of 19 mag < r < 22
mag are classiﬁed as member galaxies (i.e., below the
black solid line). For the statistical correction of the
background galaxy contamination at 19 mag < r < 22
mag, we calculated the correction factor at each magni-
tude bin:

that the stars (cyan dots) deﬁned by CLASS STAR > 0.8 exhibit
a tight sequence that is well separated from the galaxies.
where BU and BL are the number of spectroscopic back-
ground galaxies above and below the black solid line of
Fig. 5, respectively. The PU and PL are the numbers
of galaxies without radial velocity information (i,e., gray
dots in Fig. 5) above and below the black solid line, re-
spectively. The correction factors are 0.77, 0.81, and 1.00
for the magnitude bins of 19 mag < r < 20 mag, 20 mag
< r < 21 mag, and 21 mag < r < 22 mag, respectively.
This indicates that 23%, 19%, and 0% of member galax-
ies deﬁned from the scaling relation are contaminated by
background galaxies at 19 mag < r < 20 mag, 20 mag
< r < 21 mag, and 21 mag < r < 22 mag, respectively.
To construct the LF for the faint galaxies, the PL was
multiplied by the correction factor for each magnitude
bin.

We also examined the contamination of foreground
galaxies using bright galaxies with available radial veloc-
ity information. We considered seven bright foreground
galaxies, which are below the lower boundary of the caus-
tic curve or −3σ away from the systemic velocity of the
Abell 119 (see Fig. 3). We deﬁned the foreground galaxy
fraction as the ratio of the number of foreground galaxies
to the number of foreground and spectroscopic member
galaxies (i.e., 200 galaxies). Assuming that the fraction
of foreground galaxies is similar in all luminosity bins,
we suggest that the foreground galaxy contamination to
the faint member galaxy sample is negligible (i.e., about
3.5%).

3. RESULTS

3.1. Galaxy Luminosity Function

Based on 916 galaxies (257 bright and 659 faint galax-
ies) and the detection completeness as well as member-
ship corrections described in the previous section, we

constructed the galaxy LF for the r-band in the range
of 13 mag < r < 22 mag (−23.3 mag < Mr < −14.3
mag), as shown in Figure 6. We ﬁrst ﬁtted the conven-
tional single Schechter function to the LF of all galaxies
(dashed curve in the top panel of Fig. 6):

Φ(M ) = Φ∗10−0.4(M −M ∗)(α+1)e−10−0.4(M −M ∗ )

,

(5)

where Φ∗ is the characteristic number density, M ∗ is the
characteristic absolute magnitude, and α is the faint-
end slope of the LF. The M ∗ may be taken as a mea-
sure of the mean luminosity of giant galaxies, and the
slope measures the relative abundance of faint galaxies.
The observed LF was only moderately represented by
the Schechter function, as revealed by a relatively large
reduced chi-square value (χ2
ν ), and the details of the LF
(in particular an apparent dip at r ∼ 18.5 mag) were not
captured.
On the other hand, a two-component ﬁt (i.e., a
sum of Gaussian and Schechter functions) has been
commonly used for describing the observed LF in
(Driver et al. 1994; Secker & Harris
many clusters
1996; Trentham & Tully
2003;
Mahdavi et al. 2005; Popesso et al. 2006; Ba˜nados et al.
2010; Yamanoi et al. 2012). This ﬁtting much better
describes the LFs of bright and faint galaxy populations.
Following Trentham & Tully (2002), we ﬁtted our data
with a two-component LF:

2002; Hilker et al.

Φ(M ) = Φge−(M −µg )2/(2σg

2)

+ Φ∗10−0.4(M −M ∗)(α+1)e−10−0.4(M −M ∗ )

.

(6)

The contribution of bright giant galaxies is described by
the ﬁrst term of the Gaussian function, which is char-
acterized by normalization (Φg), peak magnitude (µg),
and dispersion (σg). The second term is the Schechter
function that describes the faint dwarf galaxies. The M ∗
is the characteristic magnitude describing the fractional
population of faint galaxies. The Φ∗ and α denote the
normalization and the faint-end slope of the ﬁtted LF,
respectively.

It is clear that the sum of Gaussian and Schechter func-
tions better ﬁts our observed galaxy counts (solid curve
in the top panel of Fig. 6). One interesting feature is the
distinct dip at r ∼ 18.5 mag (Mr ∼ −17.8 mag), which
distinguishes the bright galaxies from the faint ones. The
presence of a dip has been discussed in many studies,
and the dips found in other clusters are present at com-
parable absolute magnitudes (Hunsberger et al. 2000;
Gonz´alez et al. 2006; Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2006;
Popesso et al. 2006; Rines & Geller 2008; Agulli et al.
2014).

Pracy et al. (2005) reported the LF of galaxies in
the Abell 119 cluster using an extensive sample based
on deep, wide-ﬁeld V -band mosaic imaging observa-
tions.
They applied a statistical correction to ac-
count for the contamination by the ﬁeld galaxy popu-
lation. While their observations cover an overall pro-
jected area of 0.85 deg2, corresponding to 9.7 Mpc2 for
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, they only provided the central
LF within 1 Mpc from the cluster center (see their ta-
ble 2), which is comparable to the areal coverage (0.36
deg2 and 3.6 Mpc2 for H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1) of our
observations.
In the bottom panel of Fig. 6, we com-

pare our LF (red ﬁlled circles) within 1 Mpc from the
cluster center with that reported by Pracy et al. (2005)
(open squares). Their V -band LF was converted into
an r-band LF through proper color conversion using the
equation of Lupton (2005)7. The absolute magnitude
was estimated by adopting the distance modulus (36.53
mag) used by Pracy et al. (2005). The general shape
of the LF of Pracy et al. (2005) is quite consistent with
ours, including the dip at r ∼ 18.5 mag.

3.2. The Environmental Dependence of the LF

It has been known that the LFs of galaxies exhibit dif-
ferent shapes and slopes in diﬀerent environments within
the clusters (De Propris et al. 2003; Popesso et al. 2006;
Adami et al. 2007). Before investigating the environ-
mental dependence of the LF in the Abell 119 cluster,
we examined the correlation between the cluster-centric
distance as a measure of the global cluster environment
and the projected local density (ρ10), derived using the
10 nearest neighbor galaxies with Mr < −16 mag, as a
proxy of local environment (see Figure 7). As expected,
ρ10 decreases with increasing the cluster-centric distance.
We ﬁtted the distribution with a King model proﬁle as
deﬁned by Adami et al. (1998b):

σ(r) = σ0


rc(cid:17)2
1 +(cid:16) r

β




+ σb,

(7)

where σ0, rc, β, and σb are the central number density,
the core radius, the slope, and the background density of
the model proﬁle, respectively. Because only the cluster

7 http://www.sdss3.org/dr9/algorithms/sdssUBVRITransform.php

members are considered, we set σb = 0 N Mpc−2. In or-
der to minimize possible contamination due to the exist-
ing sub-clusters on the outskirts of the Abell 119 cluster
(e.g., Tian et al. 2012), only the galaxies bounded be-
tween 0.05 deg and 0.3 deg from the cluster center are
used for the King model ﬁt. As suggested by Tian et al.
(2012), it is evident that some galaxies deviate from the
model proﬁle, with a signiﬁcant density peak for the
cluster-centric distances in the range of 0.3-0.45 deg. The
dominating feature, however, is that the overall galaxy
distribution satisfactorily follows the King model proﬁle
(solid curve in Fig. 7). By dividing our observed ﬁeld
into 16 sub-regions with the same area of 73.4 arcmin2
(see inset of Fig. 7), we identiﬁed eight overdense re-
gions (F1, F2, F3, F6, F7, F9, F12, and F16), in which
the local galaxy densities, considering the bootstrap er-
rors, are above the best-ﬁt King model proﬁle for a given
cluster-centric distance. The region F10 corresponds to
the densest central region of the Abell 119 cluster, in-
cluding the peak in the galaxy density contour map and
the central cluster galaxy UGC 579.

In Figure 8, we show the LFs of galaxies for diﬀerent
environments within the Abell 119 cluster. The inner and
the outer regions of the Abell 119 cluster are deﬁned as
those inside and outside of the 0.20 deg of cluster-centric
distance, respectively, which delimits the area of intra-
cluster medium emitting X-ray emission (see the large
dotted circle and the blue contours in the bottom panel
of Figure 11). We also considered high- and low-density
regions, divided by the local density (log10 ρ10 = 2.1
N Mpc−2) which corresponds to the local galaxy den-
sity at 0.2 deg of cluster-centric distance in the King
model proﬁle in Fig. 7. In all panels, the red ﬁlled circles
and the blue open circles are the data for the galaxies
in the inner/high-density and outer/low-density regions,
respectively.

We attempted to ﬁt the LFs in the diﬀerent environ-
ments using a single Schechter function (dashed lines in
Fig. 8) which allows to examine the variations in the
overall LF shape. Because in all cases the LFs of galaxies
are inadequately ﬁtted by the single Schechter function,
we focused on the slope values for the power-law part.
It is worth noting that the slopes (−1.57/−1.63) for the
outer/low-density regions are systematically steeper than
those (−1.34/−1.28) for the inner/high-density regions
(see Table 1). By contrast, Pracy et al. (2005) found
no signiﬁcant systematic LF slope variations with the
cluster-centric distance in the Abell 119 cluster. We
also ﬁtted the LFs with the two-component function:
red and blue solid curves are for the inner/high-density
and outer/low-density regions, respectively. The LFs for
both environments follow well the two-component func-
tion, with clear dips around Mr = −18 mag, which
is more prominent for the galaxies in the outer/low-
density regions. Moreover, the number ratios of bright
to faint components (Φg/Φ∗) measured from the two-
component function of the inner/high-density regions
(Φg/Φ∗ = 0.14/0.17) are larger than those of the
outer/low-density regions (Φg/Φ∗ = 0.09/0.07). All of
these LF variations, depending on the environmental pa-
rameters, are common for many clusters (e.g., Goto et al.
2005; Mercurio et al. 2003, 2006; Popesso et al. 2006;
Ba˜nados et al. 2010). The best-ﬁt parameters of the sin-

densities and the cluster-centric distances of 16 sub-regions of the Abell 119 cluster, and their sizes correspond to the bootstrap errors. The

and the contours of the distribution of the local projected galaxy density.

gle Schechter function and the two-component function
are listed in Table 1.

We also estimated the number ratio of luminous to
faint galaxies (L/F ratio), which roughly reﬂects the LF
slope. The L/F ratio is a common indicator for inves-
tigating the luminosity segregation of galaxies in a clus-
ter (Andreon 2002; Mercurio et al. 2003; Ba˜nados et al.
2010). To calculate the L/F ratio, we deﬁned “lumi-
nous” and “faint” galaxies as those with Mr < −18 mag
(r < 18.3 mag) and with −18 mag < Mr < −14.3 mag
(18.3 mag < r < 22.0 mag), respectively. Mr = −18
mag corresponds to the magnitude at which the LF ex-
hibits a distinct dip. Figure 9 shows the L/F ratio (top
panels) for all (black ﬁlled circles), red (red open circles),
and blue (blue open diamonds) galaxies, as a function of
the cluster-centric distance (left panel) and the projected
local density (right panel). As expected, in all cases, a
strong dependence of the L/F ratio on the cluster-centric
distance and local galaxy density is evident; the L/F ra-
tio decreases with increasing the cluster-centric distance
and decreasing the local galaxy density, i.e., luminous
galaxies are concentrated toward the cluster center and
prefer high-density regions. The L/F ratio decreases by
a factor of four as we move from the center (<0.1 deg) to
the outer regions (>0.4 deg). This indicates that there
is a signiﬁcant luminosity segregation of galaxies in the
Abell 119 cluster. We also observe that the trends of the
L/F ratio for red and blue galaxies (the deﬁnition is pro-

vided below) are oﬀset (i.e., by ∼20-30%). For a given
environment, the overall fraction of luminous galaxies in
the red sample is higher than that in the blue sample.

By

using

Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut
(BATC) multicolor optical photometry, Tian et al.
(2012)
investigated the faint-to-bright galaxy ratio
(FBR) of the Abell 119 cluster, down to the limiting
magnitude of iBAT C = 19.5 mag, which is comparable
to r = 19.8 mag (Mr = −16.5 mag) (Zhou et al. 2003;
Lupton 2005). In contrast to our results, they found no
signiﬁcant dependence of the FBR on the cluster-centric
distance and local galaxy density.
Following their
deﬁnition of bright (MR < −19.5 mag corresponding to
Mr < −19.3 mag) and faint (−19.5 mag < MR < −16.7
mag corresponding to −19.3 mag < Mr < −16.5 mag)
galaxies, we also examined the variation in the L/F
ratio (gray ﬁlled squares in the top panels of Fig. 9).
Consistent with the conclusions of Tian et al. (2012),
we found no prominent variation in the L/F ratio
and conﬁrmed the rather ﬂat distribution within error
bars. The disagreement between the results of our
analysis and that of Tian et al. (2012) is probably
owing to the diﬀerence between the assumed magnitude
limit, discriminating between bright and faint galaxies.
The magnitude limit (Mr = −19.3 mag) adopted by
Tian et al. (2012) was ∼1 magnitude brighter than
ours, preventing an accurate determination of the faint
end of the LF. Furthermore, the shallow photometry

of Tian et al. (2012) might also be responsible for
uncertainties in the completeness of their faint galaxy
sample.

The blue-to-total galaxy ratio, B/(B+R), where B and
R are the number of blue and red galaxies, respectively,
indicates the evolutionary status of the cluster galaxies as
a function of the environment (Li et al. 2009). The blue
and red galaxies denote those with g − r colors bluer and
redder than the red sequence −3σg−r (see Section 2.3.1),
respectively. In the bottom panels of Fig. 9, we show the
B/(B+R) ratio as a function of the cluster-centric dis-
tance (left panel) and the projected local density (right
panel) for all, bright, and faint galaxies. The B/(B+R)
ratio for all galaxies (black solid line with the black ﬁlled
circles) increases with the cluster-centric distance and
decreases with the local galaxy density. This is in accor-
dance with the well-known observational trend between

morphology (or color) and density, in which red, early-
type galaxies favor the central regions of a cluster with
high densities, while blue, late-type galaxies are more
common on the cluster outskirts with low densities (e.g.,
Dressler 1980; Cooper et al. 2007; Bamford et al. 2009).
We also examined the relative contribution of the
bright and faint galaxy populations to the B/(B+R) ra-
tio. The B/(B+R) ratio of bright galaxies (red dashed
line with the red open squares) is relatively low and does
not exhibit signiﬁcant environmental variations within
the errors, implying that the majority (i.e., ∼80-90%)
of bright galaxies are red, passive galaxies regardless of
the environments in the Abell 119 cluster. On the other
hand, it is interesting to note that the B/(B+R) ratio of
faint galaxies (blue dotted line with the blue open trian-
gles) is more sensitive to the environment, exhibiting a
steeper trend than the bright galaxies. While red, faint

galaxies dominate in the central, high-density regions,
about half of all faint galaxies in the outer, low-density
regions are blue (see also Popesso et al. 2006). Conse-
quently, while red galaxies dominate for both bright and
faint galaxies, in the highest density regions, the frac-
tion of blue galaxies depends strongly on luminosity in
the lower density regions (see also Haines et al. 2007;
Bamford et al. 2009).

for all galaxies and for red galaxies, respectively). On
the other hand, blue galaxies (blue open diamonds) ex-
hibit an almost ﬂat distribution without signiﬁcant varia-
tion in the galaxy number density with the cluster-centric
distance (e.g., Hwang & Lee 2008; Biviano & Poggianti
2009). From the density proﬁles of red and blue galaxies,
we again conﬁrm that the trend of the B/(B+R) ratio for
all galaxies as a function of the cluster-centric distance
and local density (see the bottom panels of Fig. 9) stems
from the steep increase in the number of red galaxies
toward the cluster center.

In order to more speciﬁcally conﬁrm the overall trends
for the L/F and B/(B+R) ratios, we have derived the
variations in the projected radial density proﬁles of
galaxies. For that, we measured the azimuth averaged
surface number density of the galaxies and ﬁtted it with
the projected King model using Equation (6). The ﬁtting
results for subpopulations with diﬀerent color and lumi-
nosity are summarized in Table 2. In the top panel of Fig-
ure 10, the density proﬁles of all (black ﬁlled circles) and
red (red open circles) galaxies are in good agreement with

Both the density proﬁles for the bright (red open
squares) and faint (blue open triangles) galaxies are well
ﬁtted by the King model (bottom panel of Fig. 10). It
is worth noting that the bright galaxies are more cen-
trally concentrated with rc = 0.23 Mpc and σ0 = 241
N Mpc−2, while the faint galaxies become sparser with

tributed (i.e., rc = 0.42 Mpc and σ0 = 269 N Mpc−2).
This is consistent with previous results obtained for other
clusters, in which fainter galaxies have more spatially ex-
tended distributions (Adami et al. 1998a; Andreon 2002;
Pracy et al. 2004; Park & Hwang 2009). Consequently,
the steep increase in the number of luminous galaxies
toward the cluster center, together with a wider distri-
bution of faint galaxies, is responsible for the trend in
the L/F ratio in Fig. 9.

3.3. Spatial Distribution of Galaxies and Luminosity

the

Simulations and observations of

the Universe have revealed that

large-scale
structure of
the
clusters of galaxies are connected through ﬁlamen-
tary networks
(West et al. 1995; Faltenbacher et al.
2005; Colberg et al. 2005; Porter & Raychaudhury 2007;
Berrier et al. 2009). Indeed, the build-up of galaxy clus-
ters is characterized by the accretion of ﬁeld galaxies or
groups of galaxies through ﬁlamentary structures (e.g.,
Adami et al. 2005; Colberg et al. 2005). Furthermore,
there is a connection between the distribution of sub-
structures in the galaxy clusters and the larger scale clus-
ter distributions (e.g., West et al. 1995). Considering the
possible existence of sub-clusters in the Abell 119 cluster
(Ramella et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2012, and see below for
details), it is of interest to examine large-scale structures
around the Abell 119 cluster and to determine the pos-
sible ﬁlamentary structure associated with the cluster.

In the top panel of Figure 11, we show the large-scale
projected distribution of galaxies around the Abell 119

cluster, by using the SDSS DR9 spectroscopic data of
galaxies with available radial velocities. We selected
the galaxies in the velocity range of vsys ± 1σv (i.e.
12 466 km s−1 < vh < 14 172 km s−1, red dots), which is
comparable to the velocity range for our bright member
galaxies, based on the estimated systemic velocity and
velocity dispersion of the Abell 119 cluster, as explained
in Section 2.3. The density distribution of these galaxies
was also superimposed onto contours (see red contours),
which could then be considered as a possible large-scale
structure closely related to the Abell 119 cluster. For
comparison, we also show the galaxies with radial veloc-
ities deviating from the systemic velocity of the Abell
119 cluster: vsys − 3σv < vh < vsys − 1σv (blue crosses)
and vsys + 1σv < vh < vsys + 3σv (green pluses), which
appear to constitute foreground/background large-scale
structure around the Abell 119 cluster. Due to the spa-
tial coverage limit of the SDSS observations, galaxy dis-
tribution in the south direction of the cluster center was
not examined.

A remarkable feature is that a large fraction of galaxies
that have similar radial velocities as the bright member
galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster is distributed along the
northeast direction from the Abell 119 cluster. Moreover,
the distribution of the galaxies extends towards the Abell
116 cluster and the galaxies appear to form a prominent
ﬁlamentary structure, connecting both clusters on the
scale of ∼2.5 deg (i.e., 7.94 Mpc). The large-scale galaxy
distribution suggests that the Abell 119 cluster is embed-
ded in the surrounding ﬁlament of galaxies and clusters.
Considering the statistical studies of large-scale inter-
cluster ﬁlaments (Bond et al. 1996; Colberg et al. 2005;
Tempel et al. 2014), it is tempting to speculate that the
galaxies might have been falling into the Abell 119 clus-
ter along the surrounding structure.

The bottom panel of Fig. 11 shows the spatial dis-
tribution of galaxies within our observed ﬁeld of view.
We also present the contour map of surface density of
the cluster member galaxies (gray contours). While the
member galaxies are mainly concentrated in the central
region within the radius of 0.2 deg (i.e., 0.64 Mpc, see
the large dotted circle) from the cluster center, it is re-
markable that the overall galaxy distribution is some-
what elongated in the northeast direction rather than
exhibiting an isotropic distribution. In addition, we also
present the 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray surface brightness distri-
bution from the ROSAT observations (blue contours) 8.
Note that the X-ray emission is only concentrated in the
central region of the cluster.

In order to further examine the details of the Abell 119
cluster structure, we divided our observed ﬁeld into 16
sub-regions (gray grid in the bottom panel of Fig. 11).
Based on the deﬁnition in Section 3.2 (see also Fig. 7),
we identiﬁed eight overdense regions (F1, F2, F3, F6,
F7, F9, F12, and F16; highlighted with yellow boxes).
Previous studies suggested that the Abell 119 clus-
ter exhibits evidence of substructures in the projected
galaxy distribution and the X-ray surface brightness
proﬁle (Fabricant et al. 1993; Kriessler & Beers 1997;
Ramella et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2012). Most of these sub-
clusters (large crosses) are located in and around these
overdense regions.

(Top) The large-scale distribution of galaxies around the Abell 119 cluster, obtained by using the SDSS DR9 spectroscopic data. The
galaxies in the diﬀerent velocity ranges are denoted by diﬀerent symbols: vsys − 3σv < vh < vsys − 1σv (blue crosses), vsys − 1σv < vh < vsys + 1σv
(red dots), and vsys + 1σv < vh < vsys + 3σv (green pluses). The gray dots show the data for the galaxies with vh < vsys − 3σv or vh > vsys + 3σv .
The red contours represent the density distribution of the galaxies with vsys − 1σv < vh < vsys + 1σv , smoothed by using a Gaussian kernel of 0.1
deg. Abell clusters located in the region are denoted by large open circles with their names indicating the clusters. The large rectangle marks our
observed ﬁeld of view. The scale of 0.5 deg corresponds to 1.59 Mpc at the distance of the Abell 119 cluster (i.e., 182 Mpc). (Bottom) The spatial
distribution of the galaxies in the r-band image of our observed ﬁeld. The gray contours show the logarithmic local galaxy density of the cluster
members. The large dotted circle indicates a 0.2 deg radius from the cluster center. The thin gray grid with labels deﬁnes the 16 sub-regions with
the same area of 73.4 arcmin2 . The central cluster region and the overdense regions are highlighted with red and yellow boxes, respectively. The
large crosses denote the locations of sub-clusters deﬁned in the previous studies (Fabricant et al. 1993; Kriessler & Beers 1997; Ramella et al. 2007;
Tian et al. 2012). The red stars are the post-merger early-type galaxies identiﬁed by Sheen et al. (2012). The 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray surface brightness
distribution from the ROSAT observations is overlaid on the blue contours.

It is interesting to note that the overdense regions are
elongated along the southwest to northeast direction, fol-
lowing the orientation of the large-scale ﬁlament struc-
ture around the Abell 119 cluster, as shown in the upper
panel of Fig. 11. Following West et al. (1995), we com-
pared the orientation of the overdense regions with that
of the larger-scale surrounding matter distribution. The
projected position angle of the overdense regions was de-
termined by the least-square ﬁt to their locations. The
position angles of the two neighbor clusters (Abell 130
and Abell 116) from the center of the Abell 119 clus-
ter were also deﬁned. For each neighbor cluster, we es-
timated the acute angle, deﬁned as the diﬀerence be-
tween the two position angles, which is a measure of
the alignment tendency between the overdense regions of
the Abell 119 cluster and the neighboring cluster. The
acute angles were ∼9 deg and ∼45 deg for the Abell
130 and Abell 116 clusters, respectively. Our results
are in good agreement with those of West et al. (1995),
who reported that the acute angles for 93 clusters are
strongly skewed toward small values (<45 deg), indicat-
ing that sub-cluster pairs tend to have the same orienta-
tion as the surrounding large-scale cluster distribution.
This ﬁnding suggests that anisotropic cluster forma-
tion continues through the merging of sub-clusters along
large-scale ﬁlamentary features in the matter distribution
(Roettiger et al. 1997; Colberg et al. 1999; West et al.
1995; Lee et al. 2014; Paz et al. 2011).

In addition, 13 bright (Mr < −20 mag) post-merger
early-type galaxies (red ﬁlled stars in the bottom panel
of Fig. 11), identiﬁed by Sheen et al. (2012), are shown as
well. About half of them (∼54%) are found in our over-
dense regions, and the rest are located in and around the
central region. This suggests that mergers of galaxies are
more frequent in overdense regions, compared with other
regions such as the cluster outskirts (Cappellari et al.
2011; Boselli et al. 2014). Sheen et al. (2012) proposed
that most of these post-merger early-type galaxies were,
however, formed from galaxy mergers in less-dense group
environments and then entered into the dense cluster re-
gion via dark matter halo mergers. Assuming that our
overdense regions are comparable to galaxy group envi-
ronments, the high frequency of post-merger galaxies in
overdense regions is in good agreement with the picture
that galaxy groups are a suitable environment for dy-
namical encounters and mergers between galaxies (e.g.,
Gottl¨ober et al. 2001; Pipino et al. 2014). Furthermore,
galaxy merging can be accelerated by the perturbative
eﬀects of a collision between a cluster and a group in the
course of accreting a group into a cluster (Bekki 1999;
Dubinski 1999; Gnedin 1999).

In Figure 12, we present the composite LF of all galax-
ies included in the eight overdense regions (red ﬁlled cir-
cles), compared with the LF of the central region (F10,
blue ﬁlled circles). The LF of the central region is sat-
isfactorily explained by using a single Schechter func-
tion (blue solid line). By contrast, the LF of the over-
dense regions can only be adequately ﬁtted by a two-
component function (red solid line). A dip at Mr ∼ −18
mag in the LF of the overdense regions is prominent,
while no such feature is found in the central region. Our
result seems to be in good agreement with previous re-
sults, reporting that two-component LFs with dips are
found in the intermediate- and low-density regions of

clusters, while the high-density region is well represented
by a single Schechter function (e.g., Mercurio et al. 2006;
Popesso et al. 2006; Ba˜nados et al. 2010).

We also estimated the L/F ratios and the B/(B+R)
ratios of the central and overdense regions; the L/F ra-
tios are 0.57 ± 0.12 and 0.26 ± 0.03 and the B/(B+R)
ratios are 0.17 ± 0.04 and 0.37 ± 0.03 for the central
and overdense regions, respectively. These values ap-
pear to be consistent with the global trend found in the
Abell 119 cluster, in which the L/F ratio decreases and
the B/(B+R) ratio increases with increasing the cluster-
centric distance (see Section 3.2). However, the appar-
ent eﬀects of cluster-centric distance and local galaxy
density on the L/F and B/(B+R) ratios are degenerate
(see Fig. 9). In order to evaluate the eﬀect of enhance-
ment of the local galaxy density (i.e., local environment)
on the L/F and B/(B+R) ratios by breaking this de-
generacy, we compared two overdense regions (F1 and
F2) with two underdense ones (F4 and F8) at similar
cluster-centric distances of ∼0.3-0.4 deg from the cluster
center (i.e., similar global cluster environment). The L/F
and B/(B+R) ratios slightly diﬀered for these overdense
and underdense regions: the L/F ratios are 0.16 ± 0.04
and 0.06 ± 0.03 and the B/(B+R) ratios are 0.37 ± 0.07
and 0.56 ± 0.12, for the overdense and underdense re-
gions, respectively. This result suggests that the cluster
galaxies located in the locally overdense regions reach a
higher fraction of luminous, red galaxies, although they
are located at similar cluster-centric distance as the other
galaxies in the outer underdense regions.
In the con-
text of “preprocessing” (Blake et al. 2004; Fujita 2004;
Tanaka et al. 2005; Cooper et al. 2007; McIntosh et al.
2008),
it is understandable that locally higher galaxy
density regions, such as galaxy groups and substructures,
are likely to be already in a more advanced evolutionary
stage, in which the galaxies have completed their star
formation and become more massive, before falling into
the cluster (Li et al. 2009; De Lucia et al. 2012).

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We have presented a detailed analysis of the LF for
galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster using photometric data
taken with the MOSAIC II CCD mounted on the Blanco
4m telescope at the CTIO. Accurate membership assign-
ment of cluster galaxies has been achieved by considering
the galaxy radial velocities as well as the color-magnitude
relation for bright galaxies and the scaling relation for
faint galaxies. The main results of our study are the
following.

(i) The LF of all galaxies in the observed region was
obtained in the r-band for 13 mag < r < 22 mag
(−23.3 mag < Mr < −14.3 mag). The LF exhibits
a clear dip at r ∼ 18.5 mag (Mr ∼ −17.8 mag), and
the sum of a Gaussian and a Schechter function is a
more suitable representation of the data compared
with a single Schechter function. The general shape
of our LF is consistent with that reported in the
previous study by Pracy et al. (2005).

(ii) To investigate the LF as a function of the environ-
ment within the Abell 119 cluster, we compared
the LFs for two diﬀerent regions characterized by
inner, high-density and outer, low-density galaxies.
The overall LF in the outer, low-density regions is
systematically steeper than that in the inner, high-
density region. The dip around Mr = −18 mag
in the outer, low-density regions is more prominent
than that in the inner, high-density region.

(iii) The L/F ratio decreases with increasing the cluster-
centric distance and decreasing the local galaxy
density,
indicating a signiﬁcant luminosity segre-
gation of galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster. The
B/(B+R) ratio for all galaxies increases with in-
creasing the cluster-centric distance and decreases
with increasing the local galaxy density, which is
consistent with the morphology-density and color-
density relations.
the
B/(B+R) ratio is more sensitive to diﬀerent envi-
ronments, exhibiting a steeper trend compared with
that for the bright galaxies.

For the faint galaxies,

(iv) From the variation in projected radial number den-
sity proﬁles of galaxies, we conﬁrmed the overall
trends of the L/F and B/(B+R) ratios as a function
of the cluster-centric distance. The number den-
sity proﬁle for red galaxies is adequately described
by the King model, with a steep increase of these
galaxies toward the cluster center. Blue galaxies
show an almost ﬂat distribution as a function of
the cluster-centric distance. In the number density
proﬁles for the bright and faint galaxies, the bright
galaxies are more centrally concentrated, while the
faint galaxies are more uniformly distributed.

(v) We deﬁned overdense regions as the regions in which
the local galaxy density is above the best-ﬁt King
model proﬁle for a given cluster-centric distance.
We found that the combined LF of overdense re-
gions exhibits a two-component function, with a
distinct dip at Mr ∼ −18 mag, while no such fea-
ture was observed for the central region. We also
compared the L/F and B/(B+R) ratios between

overdense and underdense regions at similar cluster-
centric distances and found that these ratios have
slightly diﬀerent values. This suggests that over-
dense regions are undergoing a diﬀerent stage of
dynamical evolution compared with the underdense
ones, even though both regions are located on the
cluster outskirts.

One of the most noticeable results of our analysis is
that the Abell 119 cluster appears to be closely associ-
ated with a large-scale ﬁlamentary structure: the over-
all galaxy distribution as well as overdense regions in
the Abell 119 cluster are found to be aligned with the
surrounding ﬁlamentary matter distribution on larger
scales (see Fig. 11). This strongly suggests that the
Abell 119 cluster is still
in the stage of cluster as-
sembly through an anisotropic accretion of groups of
galaxies along the ﬁlamentary structure (e.g., West et al.
1995). The overdense regions are likely associated with
subgroups that migrate in perpendicular to the line-of-
sight from the cluster outside, forming elongated struc-
ture along the infall direction (e.g., Vijayaraghavan et al.
2015). It is worth noting that the results of many ob-
servations have supported the possible scenario of a re-
cent or ongoing merger between the main cluster and
sub-clusters in the Abell 119 cluster (Edge et al. 1990;
Bliton et al. 1998; Feretti et al. 1999; Vikhlinin et al.
2009; Rossetti & Molendi 2010). In this respect, we may
be witnessing the epoch of cluster build-up by the assem-
bly of multiple galaxy groups in the context of hierarchi-
cal structure formation.

Mergers between galaxies are expected to be much
more frequent in galaxy groups owing to the slow orbital
motions of the galaxies within such relatively low-density
environments compared with galaxy clusters (Ostriker
1980).
In this respect, galaxy groups exhibit an in-
teresting feature in their galaxy LF owing to the fact
that galaxy mergers change the luminosity distribution
of galaxies and therefore inﬂuence the LF shape. It has
been shown that galaxy groups with low-velocity disper-
sions exhibit dips in their LFs (Miles et al. 2004). A pos-
sible explanation is that dynamical friction causes more
rapid galaxy merging in the center of the group, which
depletes intermediate-luminosity galaxies to form a few
luminous ones, resulting in the distinct dip observed in
the LF (e.g., Trentham & Tully 2002; Miles et al. 2004,
2006). Thus, as the galaxy group evolves, the bright end
of the LF is strongly modiﬁed, while the faint end retains
its initial shape (Miles et al. 2004).

If groups survive on the outskirts of the Abell 119 clus-
ter after they fall into the cluster, they might be seen
as overdense regions in which the local galaxy density is
higher than the mean value at a given cluster-centric dis-
tance. We suspect that the galaxies in these overdense
regions may not yet have experienced the severe environ-
mental eﬀects of the cluster, preserving their dynamically
cold behavior of a group environment. In this way, the
overdense regions can retain their two-component LFs
with a dip, which was shaped in the group environment
before they are fully accreted into the cluster. The lack
of X-ray emission in most of the overdense regions (see
Fig. 11) would also imply that they are not yet virial-
ized, suggesting that most of the galaxy mergers have
taken place in recent epochs. As a result, it would be

likely to observe a two-component LF with a dip in the
overdense regions of the Abell 119 cluster similar to that
found in group environments (see Fig. 12). By contrast,
in the high-density cluster core, high-velocity dispersions
inhibit the merging of dwarf or intermediate-mass galax-
ies to produce luminous galaxies. In addition, the lack
of a dip in the LF of the central region of the Abell
119 cluster can be also attributed to the tidal or colli-
sional disruption of dwarf galaxies near the cluster center
(Mercurio et al. 2006; Popesso et al. 2006).

The above explanation seems to be supported by the
relation between the velocity dispersion of sub-regions
and the diﬀerence between the r-band magnitudes of
the brightest and second brightest galaxy (i.e., ∆m12)
in each sub-region (see Figure 13). The overdense re-
gions (yellow open circles) appear to exhibit systemat-
ically lower velocity dispersions and larger ∆m12 val-
In particular, the overdense regions with no X-
ues.
ray emission (i.e., F1, F2, F3, F12, F16,
large cyan
ﬁlled circle) exhibit a distinctly smaller mean velocity
dispersion (534 ± 148 km s−1) and a larger mean ∆m12
(1.47 ± 0.82 mag) compared with that of the central re-
gion (i.e., 1161 ± 196 km s−1 and 0.02 mag). This result
is consistent with the scenario in which galaxy mergings
are more frequent in a system with low-velocity disper-
sion, leading to a large magnitude gap between bright-
est galaxies (e.g., Miles et al. 2004; Dariush et al. 2007,
2010; Harrison et al. 2012; Gozaliasl et al. 2014).

Further circumstantial support for frequent merging
events in a low-velocity dispersion system comes from
the direct discovery of merger relics in cluster galax-
ies. Sheen et al. (2012) recently reported that a surpris-
ingly large portion (38%) of massive early-type galaxies
exhibit post-merging features in the Abell 119 cluster.
Considering simple theoretical estimations of the merger

timescale as a function of the relative speeds between
galaxies, this is an unexpected result in a cluster envi-
ronment. They suggested that a large fraction of massive
early-type galaxies are formed through galaxy mergers in
a low-density environment such as a galaxy group, and
then fall into the cluster via cluster-group halo merg-
ers. The post-merger features are typically visible in
the current cluster for about a few Gyr (Sheen et al.
2012; Yi et al. 2013; Ji et al. 2014).
In this respect, it
is worth noting that a large fraction (54%) of the post-
merger galaxies in the Abell 119 cluster are detected in
our overdense regions, supporting again the notion that
overdense regions are comparable to the environment of
galaxy groups where galaxy mergers are frequent. Con-
sequently, the bimodal shape of the LFs as well as the
high frequency of post-merger galaxies in the Abell 119
cluster indicate that the group environment is responsi-
ble for “preprocessing” galaxies on smaller scales or in
local structures prior to the assembly of galaxy groups
into the larger global cluster scale. More studies for other
dynamically young clusters are required to conﬁrm the
universal feature of their bimodal LF and then to con-
strain the assembly history of galaxy clusters.
