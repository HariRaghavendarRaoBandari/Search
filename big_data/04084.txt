We studied the optimization scheme for a ﬁrst order correction and the ultra-relativistic case of
a quantum heat engine working whit two non-interacting fermions in a three level system and a
one dimensional box-trap. The cycle under study consists of two adiabatic and two isoenergetics
reversible trajectories in conﬁguration space. Given the possibility to make the speed of the wall
ﬁnite and the existence of a heat leakage between the two energy, we found the correction for the
expression in power output and the eﬃciency previously reported.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of a quantum heat engine was introduced
by Scovil and Schultz- Dubois [30] and has been discussed
extensively in the literature[3–17]. The principal diﬀer-
ence between the classical engine cycles and the quan-
tum version resides in the quantum mechanical nature of
the working substance, which has exotic properties [3, 4].
Several theoretical implementations for a quantum heat
engine have been reported, such as entangled states in a
qubit [17], quantum mechanical versions of the Otto cy-
cle [14, 15], photocells [12, 13] and a strained single-layer
graphene ﬂake [37]. In recent years, it has been proposed
that if the reservoirs are also of a quantum mechanical
nature, these could be engineered into quantum coherent
states [12, 13] or into squeezed thermal states [15], thus
allowing for a theoretical enhancement of the engine ef-
ﬁciency beyond the classical Carnot limit [12, 13, 15].

One of the simplest theoretical implementations for a
quantum heat engine is a system composed of one or more
particles trapped in a one dimensional potential well [3–
9, 25, 33, 34]. The diﬀerent trajectories can be driven
by a quasi-static deformation of the potential well by ap-
plying an external force. The case of the Schr¨odinger
spectrum for two levels and one particle in a Isoenergetic
cycle originally proposed by Bender et al. [3] lead many
studies and publications under that considered replacing
the heat baths with energy baths. The basic idea of this
possibility is that the expectation value of the energy is
a quantity well deﬁned in quantum mechanics [3] . One
of the most interesting studies in a Isoenergetic cycle is
the scheme of optimization proposed by Abe [33], which
consist of the possibility the well width’s movement speed
ﬁnite; this is analogous to making the speed of the piston
ﬁnite in the context of the ﬁnite-time thermodynamics
[25, 33, 34]. This study is extended in the publication of
Wang et al. [34] for two particles and three levels, show-
ing an enhanced value for the power output and includes
the possibility to have a heat leakage Qr between the
two energy baths. The generalization of this problem,
N fermions in M levels, is presented in Ref. [25], which

includes an excellent discussion of the power-law energy
spectrum.

The case of a relativistic regime of the work of Bender
et al [3] is studied in Ref.
[29], which found an analyt-
ical and exact solution for the eﬃciency and showed a
lower value for the case of the ultra-relativistic particles.
Unfortunately the extension for the case of more than
one particle is diﬃcult due to the structure of the en-
ergy spectrum reported in Ref.
[29], which complicates
optimization studies. In the present work, we study the
possibility to using a Taylor series to the power of (λ/L),
in which λ is the Compton wave length and L is the width
of the potential, to ﬁnd an elegant solution to the con-
tribution for the ﬁrst relativistic order correction for two
particles and three levels for one dimensional box and
show how it aﬀects the calculation of the optimization
region. Another important limit of theoretical interest is
the ultra-relativistic case whose spectrum energy is pro-
portional to L−1 in contrast of the Schr¨odinger spectrum
whisch is proportional to L−2. The discussion of this last
case will allow us to enrich the results and conclusions we
obtain for the ﬁrst order correction.

II. A DIRAC PARTICLE TRAPPED IN A

ONE-DIMENSIONAL INFINITE POTENTIAL

WELL

The problem of a Dirac particle in the presence of a
one-dimensional, ﬁnite potential well V (x) is expressed
by the Dirac Hamiltonian operator [22, 23],

ˆH = −icα · ∇ + mc2 ˆβ + V (x)ˆ1.

Here,

ˆαi =(cid:18) 0 ˆσi

ˆσi 0 (cid:19) ,

0

ˆβ =(cid:18) I

0 −I (cid:19)

are Dirac matrices in 4 dimensions, with ˆσi the Pauli ma-
trices. The domain of this operator is D( ˆH) = H, with
H = L2(R) ⊕ L2(R) ⊕ L2(R) ⊕ L2(R) ≡ L2(R, C4) the

ˆH0 = −icα · ∇ + mc2 ˆβ,

where

(3)

Hilbert space of (complex-valued) 4-component spinors
ˆψ(x) = (φ1, φ2, χ3, χ4), where each component φi, χj ∈
L2(R) is therefore a square-integrable function in the un-
bounded domain R. The mathematical and physical pic-
tures are given by considering the singular limit of an
inﬁnite potential well,

V (x) =(cid:26) 0 ,
+∞ ,

|x| ≤ L/2
|x| > L/2

.

the same as

The singular character of the inﬁnite potential well,
which is
in the more familiar
Schr¨odinger case [26], requires a diﬀerent mathematical
statement of the problem. One must to deﬁne a self-
adjoint extension [22, 26, 28, 38] of the free Hamiltonian
particle

that

whose domain D( ˆH0) ⊂ HΩ is a dense proper subset
of the Hilbert space HΩ = L2(Ω) ⊕ L2(Ω) ⊕ L2(Ω) ⊕
L2(Ω) ≡ L2(Ω, C4) of square-integrable (complex-
valued) 4-component spinors in the closed interval x ∈
Ω = [−L/2, L/2]. In general, the domain of ˆH0 and its
adjoint ˆH†0 verify D( ˆH0) ⊆ D( ˆH†0 ) [22]. However, physics
requires that ˆH0 be self-adjoint. The self-adjoint exten-
sion is obtained by imposing appropriate boundary con-
ditions [22, 26, 28, 38] on the spinors at the boundary ∂Ω
of the ﬁnite domain Ω and in the use of a fundamental
discrete symmetry of the Dirac Hamiltonian (parity), as
discussed in detail in Ref.[29]. This approach provide a
physically acceptable spinor-eigen functions, given by

This situation may be of interest in graphene systems,
where conduction electrons in the vicinity of the so-
called Dirac point can be described as eﬀective mass-
less chiral particles, satisfying Dirac’s equation in two
dimensions[18–21].

(10)

The ﬁrst term in Eq.(8) represents the total energy
change due to an iso-entropic process, while the second
term represents a trajectory where the energy spectrum
remains rigid. As in a classical system, we deﬁne a gen-
eralized force Yn = −δW/dyn. For this case, the external
force driving the change in the width of the potential well
must be equal to the “internal pressure” of one dimen-
sional system,

In the context of Quantum Statistical Mechanics, entropy
is deﬁned according to von Neumann [41, 42] as S =

−kB Tr ˆρ ln ˆρ. This entropy vanishes when the density
matrix ρ is of a pure state [27, 33]; we will consider the
Shannon entropy instead of the von Neumann entropy.
The Shannon entropy can be expressed in terms of the
expansion coeﬃcient as

3

n |2 = 1, with a(j)

form P |a(j)

n being the expansion coeﬃ-
cients of jth particle occupying the nth eigenstate. We
can then write the energy of the system as a function of
L as follows

(16)

In our notation, we emphasize explicitly the dependence
of the energy eigenstates {|ψ(L)i} on the width of the
potential well L. The coeﬃcients an are L dependent too,
but in order to simplify our notation we do not explicit
the dependence.

The working substance of our QHE consists of two non-
interacting relativistic particles in a system of three pos-
sible levels operating under a Isoenergetic cycle. The
Isoenergetic cycle, a scheme for a quantum heat-engine
originally proposed by Bender et al. [3, 4], is composed by
two isoentropic and two isoenergetic trajectories. In par-
ticular, during the isoenergetic trajectories, the ”working
substance” must exchange energy with an energy reser-
voir [5, 6]. A possible practical realization of this cy-
cle was proposed in several works [3, 5, 31, 35], where
the working substance exchanges energy with an exter-
nal ﬁeld, which acts as an energy reservoir and plays the
role of heat baths in a traditional quantum heat engine
[34, 35]. During the iso-energetic stage, the level of oc-
cupation changes and at the end of the process, in the
context of maximal expansion (compression), the parti-
cles are localized in the closest upper (lower) level. On
the other hand, during the iso-entropic process, the co-
eﬃcients |an| do not change and represent a strong, suf-
ﬁcient condition for the entropy to remain constant, but
this is not a necessary condition [43]. Then, the occupa-
tion level must not change during this process, and no
heat is exchanged during this stage.

The scheme of this work is illustrated in the Fig 1.
During the ﬁrst stage, 1 → 2 the width of the potential
expands slowly, and the expectation of the Hamiltonian,
12(L) = ED

H remains constant. The total energy of the
system can be rewritten as

where we change the index n to j, and N represents the
total number of particles present. Unfortunately, this
series does not have an analytical expression as found in
the Schr¨odinger problem [25],

where M represents the number of levels present; this ex-
pression is subject to the restriction imposed by Eq.(15).
From Eq.(16), we determine the expression for the force
which is given by

(17)

One of the most important points of the restriction that
can be obtained from the iso-energetic stage is that the
expression of the force can be compacted in a convenient
way.
In this case, the relation cannot be obtained as
it could in case of power-law potentials [36]. However,
the physical interest of this work focuses on found the
relativistic correction of the Wang et al. [34] publication.
To do that, we work with the ﬁrst order correction of
the spectrum given in the Eq.(5), and we develop the
iso-energetic cycle considering the case of N = 2 and
M = 3. On the other hand, we achieve interesting results
when we take the ultra-relativistic limit and compare the
results with the prediction of the general case in potential
with a power-law trap.

A. First Order Correction

For this case we can use a Taylor series for the spec-
2L1 ≪ 1. Then, the initial

the initial energy for the cycle is given by

where G1 ≡ PN

FIG. 1: The four processes of the Isoenergetic cycle schemati-
cally represented. The initial conﬁguration corresponds to the
particle one (1) in the ground state level and the second parti-
cle (2) in the ﬁrst excited state. The ﬁrst process correspond
to isoenergetic expansion from L1 → L2 and are coupled with
an energy bath EH.
In the context of maximal expansion,
when the system is in L2, the ﬁrst particle (1) is in the ﬁrst
excited state and the second particle (2) in the second excited
state. During this process, the system absorbs energy from
EH. Similarly, the third process corresponds to isoenergetic
compression from L3 → L4 coupled with an energy bath EC.
For maximal compression, the particles return to the initial
conﬁguration, and the system releases energy to the energy
bath EC. For the two adiabatic processes (L2 → L3 and
L4 → L1) the entropy remains constant, and the two parti-
cles stay in ﬁxed states.

ﬁrst order correction for the ratio between the diﬀerent
widths of the wall and using an approximation of the

Then, we can compact the force as follows

(46)

(47)

In the context of maximal expansion, when the system is
in L2, we obtain from the Eq.(44) and Eq.(45), L2 = 5
3 L1.

For the process 2 → 3 the system expands adiabati-
cally from L = L2 to L = L3. The system remains in
the initial conﬁguration before this process begins; that
means, |a(1)
3 | = 1 and all other coeﬃcients are
equal to zero. The expected value for the energy through-
out the process is given by E23 = 5πc
L , and the force is
given by F23 = 5πc
L2 .

For the isoenergetic compression, the expectation value

of the Hamiltonian is kept constant as

EC =

Using the same treatment that the presented earlier, it
is easy to show that force is given by

F34(L) =

and under the maximal compression we obtain the rela-
tion L4 = 3

Now we discuss the case of the asymptotic limit of the
spectrum Eq.(5) given by Eq.(7). In this case, the initial
energy of the cycle described previously is given by

EH =

3πc

(43)

Throughout the ﬁrst process, the energy as a function of
L can be rewritten as

For the last process, adiabatic compression, from L4 to
L1, the energy of the system as a function of L is given
by E41 = 3πc
L and the force applied to the wall of the
potential is F41 = 3πc

V. OPTIMIZATION OF THE PERFORMANCE

A. First Order Correction

OF THE HEAT ENGINE

The power output after a single cycle for this case is

7

Upon realizing ﬁnite power, clearly we cannot intro-
duce heat ﬂuxes because we work with energy baths and
not heat baths. The one and only possibility here, pro-
posed by Abe [33], is to make the average speed of vari-
ation of L ﬁnite. It is important to recall that the time
scale of the change of the states is much larger than that
of the dynamical one, /E [25, 33, 34]. Then, the adi-
abatic scheme may be applied. We deﬁne the average
speed of the variation of L as ¯v(t), and it must be slow
enough that the adiabatic scheme remains valid. The to-
tal time of the cycle τ is under study. The total amount
of movement during a single cycle, L0, is given by

L0 = (L2 − L1) + (L3 − L2) + (L3 − L4) + (L4 − L1)

= 2(L3 − L1).

(53)

The total time τ as a function of the average speed is

τ =

L0
¯v

=

2(L3 − L1)

¯v

.

(54)

In this section we discuss the optimization scheme as fol-
lows, ﬁrst we use a deﬁnition of power output, given by
P = W/τ , where W corresponds to the total work along
one cycle discussed in the last section. Second, we de-
ﬁne a dimensionless parameter r = L3/L1 to obtain the
power output and the eﬃciency of the quantum engine
as a function of r. It is convenient to deﬁne the dimen-
sionless power output P ∗(r) = W
sτ , with s a constant for
the model. For P ∗, we can calculate the value r = rmp
which corresponds to the point given by the maximiza-
tion condition ∂P ∗
∂r |r=rmp = 0. On the other hand, the
eﬃciency depends on the heat leakage ˙Qr, which can be
rewritten in the form of Qr = αq, where q it is an ex-
pression that depends on the model, and the parameter
α is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the maximiza-
tion condition for the eﬃciency given by ∂η
∂r|r=rmη = 0 is
strongly aﬀected by the value of the parameter α.

Finally, we present the two cases discussed in the
last section, the ﬁrst order correction and the ultra-
relativistic case and ﬁnd the characteristic curve of P ∗
- η, which describes the two maximum points previously
mentioned. The optimization region of the engine is de-
ﬁned as

ηmp ≤ η ≤ ηmax,

Pmη ≤ P ≤ Pmax.

(55)

For the ﬁrst order correction, we present a table of
values for r = rmp for diﬀerent cases of (λ/2L1)2 (ﬁxed
to do the optimization scheme). We compare these values
with those of a non-relativistic engine and see the eﬀect
of correction in the diﬀerent graphics of interest. For the
Ultra-relativistic case, we obtain an analytical result in
line with that presented in Ref.
[25, 36] for power-law
potentials.

We take the average between the two extreme values for

simplify the discussion.

of non-relativistic particles and the ﬁrst order correction.
The eﬀect is clear: the power output decreases. The to-
tal work under one cycle, given by the Eq.(41), is lower
than that present in Ref.
[34]; these results are coher-
ent with those reported in Ref. [29] which demonstrated
that the total work is less in the case of relativistic parti-
cles. In Table I, we show the diﬀerent values for rmp and
P ∗max starting with the values obtained in [34] and then

non-relativistic case for an example case when λ/L1 is

the two characteristic maximum points for the eﬃciency,
ηmp and ηmax and the two maximum points for the di-
mensionless power output P ∗max and P ∗mη on loop-shaped
curves for P ∗ − η. Therefore, if λ/L1 is ﬁxed, the value
of rmη can be obtained from Eq.(60) and used to replace
this value in the Eq.(57) to obtain P ∗mη. For the same
value of λ/L1 the point rmp can be obtained by calculat-
ing the derivative of the Eq.(57); this can then replace
the value in Eq.(59) to obtain the value of ηmp. Thus
we have a family of loop-shaped curves always limited by
the values presented in the work of Wang et al [34].

The eﬃciency at the maximum power output in the ultra
relativistic limit is lower than the non-relativistic case,
and is line with the result in the ﬁrst order correction
present in this work.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have presented an idea for a ﬁrst or-
der relativistic correction for the calculations presented
in the Ref. [34] and the ultra-relativistic case that used
the power law potentials presented in [25, 36]. We have
shown that the power output decreases and is in agree-
ment with the results for ultra-relativistic calculations.
For the case of the ﬁrst order correction, we have a fam-
ily of function that can be plotted in the characteristic
curve P ∗ − η and provide the values P ∗max, Pmη, ηmp and
ηmax. From Table I, we can see that the dimensionless
power output decreases and the value of rmp increases
from the value rmp = 2.367114902 to rmp = 2.372935642
bringing an expected result if we see the value of the
ultra-relativistic case which is given by rmp ∼ 2.721. The
combination of the kind of power law potentials provides
a non-trivial relation for the force along the Isoenergetic
cycle, but we believe that by exploring some small param-
eters of the model, simpliﬁed version could be obtained.
This could be used to study its aﬀects on a know model
or to address a new problem of interest. On the other

hand, we completed the study whit the ultra relativistic
case, and we plotted our results with the curves for the
case of two particles and two levels studied by Abe [33]
and the work of Wang et al.
[34]. The ultra-relativistic
case provides a power-law spectrum that is generalized in
the works [25, 36], and we present these results to enrich
the discussion.

It is important to check our approximation considering
the case of maximal expansion when L1 → L2, so x → x2.
The ﬁrst particle is in the ﬁrst excited state, and the
second particle is in the second excited sate. Under this
condition, D is ﬁxed in the value D = 13, and we get for

the expression

result of a non-relativistic case [34] as we comment in the
work. Therefore, to ﬁnd an elegant and physical solution,
without loosing important in-
formation. Thus, we can replace the approximate solu-

to obtain

In the context of maximal compression when L3 → L4
