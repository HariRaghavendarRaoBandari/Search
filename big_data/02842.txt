Equilibration of isolated many-body quantum systems with respect to general

distinguishability measures

Universit¨at Bielefeld, Fakult¨at f¨ur Physik, 33615 Bielefeld, Germany

Ben N. Balz and Peter Reimann

We demonstrate equilibration of isolated many-body systems in the sense that, after initial tran-
sients have died out, the system behaves practically indistinguishable from a time-independent
steady state, i.e., non-negligible deviations are unimaginably rare in time. Measuring the distin-
guishability in terms of quantum mechanical expectation values, results of this type have been
previously established under increasingly weak assumptions about the initial disequilibrium, the
many-body Hamiltonian, and the considered observables. Here, we further extend these results
with respect to generalized distinguishability measures which fully take into account the fact that
the actually observed, primary data are not expectation values but rather the probabilistic occur-
rence of diﬀerent possible measurement outcomes.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Does a macroscopic system, prepared in a non-
equilibrium initial state, and evolving in isolation from
the rest of the world, approach a steady state in the
long time limit? Due to quantum revivals, time inver-
sion invariance, and other quite obvious reasons (see Sect.
III A), such a relaxation towards an equilibrium state can
certainly not be true in the strict sense. On the other
hand, “practical equilibration” has been established in
Refs. [1–4] under quite weak conditions in the sense that
the expectation value of quantum mechanical observables
remains extremely close to a constant value for the over-
whelming majority of all suﬃciently late times. In other
words, deviations of expectation values from a steady
long time limit are either so small or so rare that they
can be safely neglected in any real experiment.

Yet, it has been pointed out by Short [2] that these
ﬁndings are still not fully satisfactory since the primary
data in a quantum mechanical measurement are not ex-
pectation values but rather the probabilistic occurrence
of diﬀerent possible measurement outcomes. Indeed, the
exact probabilities of those outcomes are generically not
strictly identical to the presumed steady state values,
hence the diﬀerence unavoidably must become statis-
tically resolvable when repeating the experiment suﬃ-
ciently many times. If such a diﬀerence would already be
recognizable by an experimentally feasible number of rep-
etitions, then practical equilibration in the above sense
would thus no longer hold true. The main purpose of
our present paper is to exclude the latter possibility by
further developing the approach from Refs. [2–4].

Two immediate next questions are: Does the steady
long time limit agree (at least approximately) with the
value predicted by one of the canonical ensembles from
textbook statistical physics? What is the characteristic
time scale governing the relaxation towards equilibrium?
Both questions are clearly of great conceptual as well as
practical importance, and they have been recently ad-
dresses by numerous analytical, numerical, and experi-

mental works, see Refs.
[5–8] for a few representative
examples. Yet, these questions are beyond the scope of
our present paper.

II. GENERAL FRAMEWORK

We focus on time-independent Hamiltonians of the

form

EnPn ,

(1)

H =Xn

where the Pn are projectors onto the eigenspaces of H
with mutually diﬀerent eigenvalues En, and where n runs
from 1 to inﬁnity or to some ﬁnite upper limit.

The main examples we have in mind are isolated
macroscopic systems with, say, f ≈ 1023 degrees of free-
dom. Compound systems, consisting of a subsystem of
actual interest and a much larger environmental bath,
are thus included as special cases. Moreover, our explo-
rations may also be of interest, e.g., for chaotic systems
with few degrees of freedom but with a high dimensional
“active Hilbert space” [9].

As usual, system states (pure or mixed) are described
by density operators ρ and observables by Hermitian
operators A. Expectation values are given by hAiρ :=
Tr{ρA} and the time evolution by ρ(t) = Utρ(0)U †
t with
propagator Ut := e−iHt ( = 1), implying with (1) that

Ut :=Pn Pne−iEnt and hence that

Amn ei(En−Em)t

hAiρ(t) = Xm,n

Amn := Tr{Pmρ(0)PnA} .

(2)

(3)

Similarly as in (1), any given observable A can be writ-

ten in the form

aν Kν ,

(4)

A =Xν

where Kν are the projectors onto the eigenspaces of A
with mutually diﬀerent eigenvalues aν. According to

textbook quantum mechanics, given a system in state
ρ(t), any single measurement of the observable A results
in one of the possible outcomes aν, and the probability
to obtain the speciﬁc outcome aν is given by

kν (t) := Tr{ρ(t)Kν} .

(5)

As an aside, we remark that our present approach could
be readily extended to the so-called positive-operator val-
ued measure (POVM) formalism: The only formal diﬀer-
ence would be that the pertinent operators Kν are then in
general no longer mutually orthogonal, a property which
we never actually exploit in the following.

Finally, we adopt the viewpoint that no experimentally
realistic measurement yields more than, say, 20 relevant
digits. Hence, we can restrict ourselves to observables A
with less than 1020 diﬀerent measurement outcomes aν,
i.e.

ν ∈ {1, 2, ..., NA} , NA < 1020 .

(6)

In view of Eq. (1), the speciﬁc observable A = Pn de-
scribes the population of the (possibly degenerate) energy
level En with expectation value (occupation probability)

pn := Tr{ρ(t)Pn} .

(7)

Since Pn commutes with H from (1), the level popula-
tions pn are t-independent (conserved quantities). Thus
they are entirely determined already by the initial con-
dition (system preparation).

For typical macroscopic systems with f ≈ 1023 degrees
of freedom, the energy levels are unimaginably dense.
Under realistic experimental conditions it is therefore
practically unavoidable to notably populate a number of
energy levels which is exponentially large in f . In turn,
every single level population pn from (7) is expected to be

extremely small (compared to Pn pn = 1) and to typi-

cally satisfy the very rough estimate maxn pn = 10−O(f ).
In the following, we even admit the possibility that one
single energy level exhibits a non-small population, for
instance a macroscopically populated ground state. Ac-
cordingly, we may still expect that

max

′pn = 10−O(f ) ,

III. THE PROBLEM OF EQUILIBRATION

A. Preliminary results

Our preliminary formulation of the problem of equili-
bration consists in the question whether, in which sense,
and under what conditions the expectation value from
(2) approaches a constant value in the long time limit.

It is quite obvious that the expectation value (2) can-
not rigorously converge towards any long time limit apart

2

from trivial cases with Amn = 0 for all m 6= n. More-
over, it is well known that any ρ(t) returns arbitrarily
close to the initial state ρ(0) for certain, suﬃciently late
time points t (quantum revivals).

The only remaining hope is that (2) approximately ap-
proaches some steady value for most suﬃciently large
times t.
Intuitively, if any such a steady asymptotics
is approached at all, then the most promising candidate
appears to be the value which is obtained by averaging
(2) over all times t ≥ 0. Since all energies En are mutu-
ally diﬀerent (see below Eq. (1)), one readily can infer
from (2) that this putative steady state should thus be
given by hAi¯ρ := Tr{ ¯ρA}, where

Pnρ(0)Pn

(9)

¯ρ :=Xn

is a non-negative Hermitian operator of unit trace and
thus a well deﬁned density operator. A result of this
type is derived in Appendix A by combining and reﬁning
techniques originally due to Refs.
[3, 4, 10]. Namely, it
is shown that the following inequality holds for all suﬃ-
ciently large T :

1

T Z T

0

dt [σ(t)]2 ≤ 3 Tr{ ¯ρA2} g max

′pn

n
σ(t) := hAiρ(t) − hAi¯ρ ,

(10)

(11)

where max′
npn is the second largest energy level popula-
tion (see around Eq. (8)) and g represents the maximal
degeneracy of energy gaps,

g := max
m6=n

|{(k, l) : Ek − El = Em − En}| ,

(12)

with |S| denoting the number of elements contained in
the set S. In other words, g is the maximal number of
exactly coinciding energy diﬀerences among all possible
pairs of distinct energy eigenvalues.

In view of (8) and disregarding exceedingly large gap
degeneracies g, the time average on the left hand side in
(10) is extremely small, implying that the deviation (11)
must be very small in modulus for most times t ∈ [0, T ].
In order to quantify this argument, we deﬁne for any
given ǫ > 0 and T > 0 the quantity

(13)

Tǫ :=(cid:12)(cid:12){ 0 ≤ t ≤ T : |σ(t)| > ǫ }(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

where |S| denotes the size (Lebesgue measure) of the set
S. In other words, Tǫ is the measure of all times t ∈ [0, T ]
for which |σ(t)| > ǫ holds true. It follows that [σ(t)]2 > ǫ2
for a set of times t of measure Tǫ and that 0 ≤ [σ(t)]2 ≤ ǫ2
for all remaining times t contained in [0, T ]. Hence the
temporal average on the left hand side of (10) must be
bounded from below by ǫ2Tǫ/T . It follows that for any
given ǫ > 0

Tǫ/T ≤ 3 Tr{ ¯ρA2} g max

n

′pn/ǫ2

(14)

for all suﬃciently large T .

Note that the left hand side of (10) remains unchanged
if A is replaced by A + c 1, where c is an arbitrary real
number and 1 the identity operator. Accordingly, we may
replace also on the right hand side of (10) A by A + c 1
with an arbitrary c. Denoting by amax and amin the
largest and smallest eigenvalues of A (cf. (4) and (6)),
and by ∆A := amax − amin the range of A, we can and
will choose c so that |aν − c| ≤ ∆A/2 for all eigenvalues
aν of A. It follows that Tr{ ¯ρ (A + c 1)2} ≤ (∆A/2)2 on
the right hand side of (10), and likewise in (14), i.e.

Tǫ
T

≤

3 ∆2

A g maxn

′pn

4 ǫ2

(15)

for all suﬃciently large T .

Relation (15) together with (8), (12), and (13) repre-
sents the answer to the above stated, preliminary prob-
lem of equilibration: For any given ǫ > 0 the “true” ex-
pectation value hAiρ(t) deviates from the constant value
hAi¯ρ by more than ǫ for a set of times t ∈ [0, T ], whose
measure Tǫ is bounded by (15) for all suﬃciently large
T . If ǫ as well as the right hand side of (15) are both
suﬃciently small, which is easily feasible in view of (8),
then it follows that hAiρ(t) is practically (within any ex-
perimentally achievable resolution) constant for the over-
whelming majority of all times t ∈ [0, T ]. In particular,
T must be so large that the initial decay process (from
the possibly far from equilibrium initial value hAiρ(0) to-
wards the equilibrium value hAi¯ρ) is accomplished during
a time interval much smaller than [0, T ].

Note that Hamiltonians with degenerate energy gaps
are, loosely speaking, of measure zero among “all” Hamil-
tonians. They only arise in the presence of special reasons
like (perfect) symmetries, additional conserved quantities
(besides H), or ﬁne-tuning of parameters. Generically, all
non-trivial energy gaps Em − En (i.e. those with m 6= n)
are thus mutually diﬀerent, implying g = 1 in (12). Our
above results remain valid even for non-generic cases with
g > 1. Likewise, Hamiltonians with degenerate energy
eigenvalues are in principle non-generic, but still admit-
ted in (1).

In summary, the true system state ρ(t) becomes experi-
mentally indistinguishable from the time independent ap-
proximation ¯ρ for practically all suﬃciently late times t
under very weak conditions on the initial state, the ob-
servable, and the Hamiltonian.

B. Reformulation of the problem

So far, the (non-)distinguishability of ρ(t) and ¯ρ was al-
ways meant with respect to the corresponding two expec-
tation values of the considered observable A. As pointed
out by Short [2], such a distinguishability criterion is not
entirely satisfying since the basic measurable quantities
are not expectation values, but rather the diﬀerent possi-
ble measurement outcomes aν, see above Eq. (5). Hence,
the distinguishability of ρ(t) and ¯ρ should be based on

3

a comparison between the actually observed, random oc-
currence of each outcome aν and the theoretical proba-
bilities kν(t) from (5) and

¯kν := Tr{ ¯ρKν} ,

(16)

predicted for a system in state ρ(t) and ¯ρ, respectively.
Indeed, it may well be that the two states ρ(t) and ¯ρ are
indistinguishable with regard to the expectation value
of A, yet they are easily distinguishable by the frequen-
cies of the measurement outcomes aν when repeating the
same measurement (same system state and same observ-
able) suﬃciently often [2].

Put diﬀerently, the actual problem of equilibration is
to show that the frequencies, with which the diﬀerent
possible measurement outcomes are realized in the true
system state ρ(t), are not incompatible in any statisti-
cally signiﬁcant way with the approximation ¯ρ.

In this statement of the problem, t is tacitly considered
as being chosen arbitrarily but then kept ﬁxed. (In Sect.
V we will extend the scope of our results also to cases
when the measurement is taken at a diﬀerent time in
each repetition). Moreover, the number of repetitions of
the experiment, henceforth denoted as Nrep, must remain
reasonable, say

Nrep < 1030 .

(17)

(This bound is reached for 1012 repetitions per second
during the age of the universe.) To understand why such
an upper bound is needed, we focus on the generic case
that the probabilities (5) and (16) with which the out-
comes aν are realized in the two states ρ(t) and ¯ρ, re-
spectively, are not exactly identical for all ν. In the limit
Nrep → ∞ it then must become apparent with arbitrary
statistical signiﬁcance that the approximation ¯ρ is incom-
patible with the observed measurement outcomes, which
are sampled according to the true system state ρ(t). In
other words, without imposing any upper bound on Nrep,
the two states ρ(t) and ¯ρ would generically be trivially
distinguishable.

Important ﬁrst steps in resolving the above stated
problem of equilibration have been achieved in Ref. [2].
In doing so, the distinguishability of ρ(t) and ¯ρ was quan-
tiﬁed as follows: Imagine that one of the two states ρ(t)
and ¯ρ were randomly chosen with probability 1/2 and
then used to sample one of the diﬀerent outcomes aν ac-
cording to the corresponding probabilities in (5) or (16).
Now, the task is to guess form the observed aν which
state (ρ(t) or ¯ρ) has been chosen, and the probability
that this guess is correct was shown in Ref.
[2] to be
ν=1 |kν (t) − ¯kν |/4. Hence, the latter
quantity was adopted in Ref. [2] as the basic measure to
quantify the distinguishability of ρ(t) and ¯ρ by means of
A.

bounded by 1/2 +PNA

We think that this approach is still unsatisfying in two
respects: (i) The underlying “state guessing task” is not
exactly equivalent to the above formulated “actual prob-
lem of equilibration”: In the actual problem, the out-
comes are always generated by ρ(t), and not by either

ρ(t) or ¯ρ with equal probability. Moreover, the actual
task is not to guess which of the two state was realized
but rather to quantify the compatibility of the state ¯ρ
with the observed measurement outcomes. (ii) The en-
tire approach is limited to single shot measurements, i.e.
to Nrep = 1.
Indeed, already in the case of two repe-
titions of the same measurement, resulting in two out-
comes aν1 and aν2 , it is not clear at all which of the two
states should be guessed according to the above described
strategy from Ref.
[2]. While a restriction like in (17)
still covers all cases of practical relevance, the same is no
longer true for the restriction Nrep = 1 considered in [2].
The main objective of our present paper is to resolve
the above issues (i) and (ii). In doing so, we will even
admit one more generalization. Namely, in every repeti-
tion j, a measurement of a diﬀerent observable Aj may
be performed (but the system state remains the same in
each repetition). In particular, some or even all Aj may
still be identical, but in general they are admitted to be
diﬀerent. In doing so we denote – similarly as in (5) – by
K (j)
the projectors onto the eigenspaces of Aj and by a(j)
ν
the corresponding eigenvalues, where ν = 1, ..., NAj . Fur-
thermore, their probabilities of occurrence are denoted –
similarly as in (5) and (16) – by

ν

ν (t) := Tr{ρ(t)K (j)
k(j)
ν }

if the system is in the state ρ(t) and as

¯k(j)
ν

:= Tr{ ¯ρ K (j)
ν }

(18)

(19)

if the system is in the state ¯ρ. Accordingly, the outcome
of our Nrep measurements can be uniquely speciﬁed by
a Nrep-dimensional vector ~s, whose j-th component sj ∈
{1, ..., NAj } speciﬁes which outcome of Aj was realized
in the j-th measurement. The probability to obtain the
outcome ~s then follows as

pt(~s) :=

Nrep

Yj=1

k(j)
sj (t)

if the system is in the state ρ, and as

¯p(~s) :=

¯k(j)
sj

Nrep

Yj=1

(20)

(21)

if the system is in the state ¯ρ. Finally, with the deﬁnition

Nobs := max

j

NAj

we can conclude from (6) that

NAj ≤ Nobs < 1020

for all j = 1, ..., Nrep.

IV. DISTINGUISHABILITY MEASURES

In essence, the situation encountered above is as fol-
lows: There is a true state ρ(t) (t arbitrary but ﬁxed)
and an approximative state ¯ρ. A series of Nrep measure-
ments of the observables Aj (j = 1, ..., Nrep) is performed
on the system state ρ(t), resulting in one of the possible
outcomes ~s. Within this setup, our key question is: Given
an outcome ~s, does the approximation ¯ρ explain the ob-
served data ~s notably worse than the truth ρ(t) would ex-
plain them, or are ρ(t) and ¯ρ both about equally well (or
badly) compatible with the given data ~s ? If the latter is
the case with very high probability when the entire series
of experiments is repeated many times (i.e. each outcome
~s is realized with probability pt(~s) from (20)), then the
two states ρ(t) and ¯ρ are practically indistinguishable by
means of the considered observables Aj . Put diﬀerently,
the approximation ¯ρ is as good as it possibly can be since
it explains the observations practically as well as the best
possible theory ρ(t) would explain them.

To further substantiate these ideas, let us focus on an
arbitrary but ﬁxed “test” (or “rule”, “strategy”, “cri-
terion”, etc.) by means of which we can (or hope to)
quantify (in whatever way) how much worse (or possibly
better) the approximation ¯ρ is compatible with a given
In doing so, the two states ρ(t)
data set ~s than ρ(t).
and ¯ρ are thus considered as known.
In particular, all
the probabilities from (20) and (21) are explicitly avail-
able and may be exploited by our test at hand. In other
words, ρ(t), ¯ρ, and ~s are the input of the test, which then
acts like a black box to produce an output in the form of
a real number q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s).

Without any signiﬁcant loss of generality we as-
sume that q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) is standardized so that it only
takes values within the interval [−1, 1]. Furthermore,
q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) = 0 indicates that ρ(t) and ¯ρ are (approx-
imately) equally well (or badly) compatible with ~s. Fi-
nally, increasingly positive q-values correspond to an in-
creasing superiority of ρ(t) over ¯ρ in explaining the data
~s, and likewise for negative q-values.

Note that we can never be “100% sure” that ¯ρ is incom-
patible with the data ~s [11]. Hence, any (reasonable) test
can only make certain probabilistic statements (based on
some certain notion of probability, likelihood, conﬁdence,
plausibility, ...) about the compatibility of ¯ρ with ~s, and
likewise for ρ(t).

We also note that for some “strange” (unlikely but not
impossible) experimental outcomes ~s, even the “reality”
ρ(t) may be incompatible (in the above mentioned proba-
bilistic sense) with ~s according to the criteria of the given
test. Likewise, the compatibility of certain ~s with ¯ρ may
actually be better (or less bad) than with ρ(t). Intuitively
(or from a Bayesian viewpoint), it seems plausible that
such cases may be realized whenever ¯p(~s) > pt(~s). They
are quantitatively taken into accounted by the negative
q values.

A particularly simple example is

q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) := f [p(ρ(t)|~s) − p(¯ρ|~s)]

p(ρ(t)|~s) :=

p(¯ρ|~s) :=

pt(~s)

pt(~s) + ¯p(~s)

¯p(~s)

pt(~s) + ¯p(~s)

,

(24)

(25)

(26)

where f [x] is some monotonically increasing functions of
x with f [−1] = −1, f [0] = 0, f [1] = 1, for instance
f [x] = x. (We tacitly restrict ourselves to outcomes ~s
which are realized with non-vanishing probability, hence
the denominators in (25) and (26) are non-zero. We also
note that since p(¯ρ|~s) = 1 − p(ρ(t)|~s), the right hand
side of (24) could equally well be written as a function of
p(ρ(t)|~s) alone.) Within the framework of Bayesian infer-
ence, p(ρ(t)|~s) and p(ρ|~s) in (25) and (26) can be identi-
ﬁed with the posterior probabilities of ρ(t) and ¯ρ, given ~s
has been observed, and assuming equal prior probabilities
for ρ(t) and ¯ρ (i.e., before the observation ~s is available).
Accordingly, (24) may be interpreted as quantifying the
likelihood of ρ(t) compared to that of ¯ρ. We, however, re-
mark that even without adopting a Bayesian viewpoint,
all quantities in (24)-(26) remain well deﬁned and admit
a decent probabilistic interpretation.

Analogously as in (24), one also could, for example,
quantify the compatibility of ρ(t) and ¯ρ with ~s in cases
when all Aj are equal by deﬁning q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) in some
suitable way via the two values which are obtained by
applying a χ2 test to the two “null hypotheses” ρ(t) and
¯ρ.

Returning to the general case of an arbitrary but ﬁxed
test, any given such test may still admit many diﬀerent
reasonable choices of q (e.g. diﬀerent functions f in (24)).
Our ﬁrst key hypothesis is now that for any given test it
is possible to choose a function q so that the quality of
this test is reasonably quantiﬁed by the distinguishability
measure

Q(t) :=X~s

pt(~s) q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) ,

(27)

i.e., by averaging q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) over many experimental
measurement series and weighting every possible out-
come ~s with the frequency pt(~s) with which it is realized.
More precisely, the existence of at least one q-function
is postulated for which a Q-value close to unity indicates
that the given test quite reliably recognizes the incompat-
ibility of ¯ρ with the measurements ~s (which were sampled
according to ρ(t)), while a Q-value close to zero indicates
that there is no way to recognize by means of the given
test any signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the truth ρ(t) and
the approximation ¯ρ when sampling a data set ~s accord-
ing to ρ(t). Note that small negative Q still indicate a
good compatibility of ¯ρ with the measurements, while
non-small negative Q-values are also possible but would
quite plausibly indicate that the given test is futile, or
that one rather should employ −q instead of q.

5

The complete set of all tests which fulﬁll our above
assumptions may still admit some undesirably biased q-
functions. The most trivial example is q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) := 1
for all ~s, yielding the highest possible score of Q(t) = 1.
The only viable way out seems to admit only tests, whose
q-function does not exploit the information that the data
~s were actually sampled according to ρ(t). In particular,
if we would secretly sample ~s not according to ρ(t) but
rather according to ¯ρ, then the very same q-function now
must recognize that ¯ρ explains the data better than ρ(t).
Accordingly, our second key hypothesis is that it is suf-
ﬁcient to focus on tests, whose q-functions satisﬁes the
following additional symmetry property: Imagine many
repetitions of our so far considered experiment. But now,
in every repetition, either ρ(t) or ¯ρ is randomly selected
with probability 1/2 and then used to randomly generate
a measurement outcome ~s with the corresponding prob-
ability (20) or (21).
In this case, we require that the
q-function must be unbiased on the average, i.e.

pt(~s) + ¯p(~s)

2

X~s

q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) = 0 .

(28)

While the above two hypotheses seem diﬃcult or im-
possible to derive from some more fundamental princi-
ples, they appear quite reasonable as they stand and are
thus taken for granted from now on. Their most impor-
tant virtue is that they imply – as demonstrated in detail
in Appendix B – the general rigorous bound

|Q(t)| ≤ Qmax(t) :=

1

2X~s

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)| .

(29)

for the distinguishability measure Q(t) from (27), inde-
pendently of any further peculiarities of the considered
test and the concomitant q-function. This is the ﬁrst
main result of our paper.

In particular, one readily veriﬁes that the example from
(24)-(26) with f [x] = x exhibits the symmetry (28) and
respects the bound (29). More generally, the symmetry
(28) imposes a non-trivial constraint on f [x] and a di-
rect veriﬁcation of (29), (without recourse to Appendix
B becomes diﬃcult.)

In hindsight, the original task to quantify the com-
patibility of ¯ρ with the experimental observations ~s may
have appeared quite daunting since this can be done in so
many diﬀerent ways, most of which one possibly did not
even think of in the ﬁrst place. The appeal of our main
result (29) is that it applies independently of the concrete
manner in which the compatibility is quantiﬁed. In par-
ticular, no explicit knowledge is needed about the best
possible way to quantify the compatibility of ¯ρ with ~s.
The only, very weak and plausible requirements are that
all considered distinguishability measures can be written
in the form (27) for some suitable q function, and that
they respect the symmetry condition (28).

V. FINAL RESULT AND CONCLUSIONS

Acknowledgments

6

The upshot of the previous section is: If we can show
that Qmax(t) from (29) is a small quantity, then there
is no way to experimentally detect any statistically sig-
niﬁcant deviation of the approximation ¯ρ from the true
system state ρ(t). The latter statement applies for an
arbitrary but ﬁxed time t and for an arbitrary but ﬁxed
measurement series A1, ..., ANrep . Hence, if we can show
that the same statement holds simultaneously for all mea-
surement series which satisfy (17) and (23) and for the
overwhelming majority of all suﬃciently late times t then
it follows – analogously as in Sect. III A – that approx-
imating ρ(t) by ¯ρ can be considered as perfect for all
practical purposes.

As detailed in Appendix C, it is indeed possible to show
that a result of the above type holds true. Quantitatively,
the result is analogous to Eqs. (13), (15), stating that

for all suﬃciently large T . This is the main ﬁnal result
of our paper. Its discussion can be conducted along very
similar lines as in Sect. III, hence we only recapitulate
here the main points: On the right hand side of (32), g
denotes the maximal degeneracy of energy gaps from (12)
(with g = 1 for Hamiltonians with a generic spectrum).
Furthermore, max′
npn is the second largest level popu-
lation and, according to (8), is typically exponentially
small in f for a system with f ≫ 1 degrees of freedom. In
view of (17) and (23) we thus can conclude that ǫ in (32)
becomes an extremely small number already for systems
with, say, more than 103 degrees of freedom.
In turn,
the Lebesgue measure (31) of those times t ∈ [0, T ], for
which there possibly may exist a non-negligible chance
to observe a resolvable diﬀerence between ρ(t) and ¯ρ by
some suitable measurement procedure, is – according to
(30) – negligibly small compared to all times t ∈ [0, T ],
provided T is suﬃciently large.

To summarize, the steady state ¯ρ approximates the
true state ρ(t) practically perfectly for all suﬃciently
large times t. While the two states are rigorously speak-
ing never close to each other in some mathematically ob-
vious way, the observable diﬀerences are either unresolv-
ably small or negligibly rare from all practical points of
view.

We ﬁnally note that by admitting the possibility to
employ in every repetition of the experiment a diﬀerent
observable Aj, our approach actually also covers the case
when the measurement is performed in every repetition
at a diﬀerent time point (which strictly speaking applies
to every real experiment). The reason is the usual equiv-
alence of the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures, i.e., a
temporal change of the system state can be replaced by
an equivalent change of the considered observable.

where g is the maximal degeneracy of energy gaps from
(12), and max′
npn is the second largest among all energy
level populations from (7).

Preliminaries

We recall that the Pn in (1) are the projectors onto the
eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian H, where n runs from 1
to inﬁnity or to some upper ﬁnite limit. In other words,
n ∈ I, where the index set I is either equal to N or
of the form {1, ..., L} with a ﬁnite upper limit L ∈ N.
Hence, the projectors Pn satisfy the usual orthogonality
and completeness relations, i.e.,

PmPn = δmnPn

for all m, n ∈ I and

Pn = 1 ,

Xn

(35)

(36)

where 1 is the identity operator and, as in (1), the sum
runs over all n ∈ I. Next we deﬁne

ρn := Pnρ(0)Pn

(37)

and we denote by SO the set of operators which con-
tains all the Pn’s and all the ρn’s.
It follows that all
operators in SO are Hermitian and commute with each
other, hence there must be a common eigenbasis for all
operators contained in SO. In other words, there is an
orthonormalized basis {|γi}D
γ=1, whose dimension D may
be either ﬁnite or inﬁnite, and whose associated projec-
tors Pγ := |γihγ| commute with all operators contained
in SO. As a consequence, also the projectors

X :=

Xγ=1

Y := 1 − X =

|γihγ| ,

(38)

D

Xγ=d+1

|γihγ| .

(39)

commute with all Pn and ρn, i.e.

XPn = PnX , Xρn = ρnX

(40)

for all n, and likewise for Y . With the deﬁnition

˜A := XAX .

(41)

for arbitrary observables A, it follows with (40) that

˜Pn := XPnX = PnX = XPn .

(42)

In particular, if one deﬁnes ˜Amn analogously as in (3)
then one readily veriﬁes that

˜Amn := Tr{Pmρ(0)Pn ˜A} = Tr{ ˜Pmρ(0) ˜PnA} (43)

by exploiting (41), (42), and the cyclic invariance of the
trace.

For any given basis vector |γi, one can infer from (35)
and (36) that Pn|γi equals |γi (eigenvalue 1) for exactly
one index n, and equals the null vector |0i (eigenvalue 0)
for all other indices n. Since d in (38) is ﬁnite, it follows
that at least one and at most d among all the ˜Pn’s in
(42) are not identically zero. Without loss of generality,
we can and will choose the labels n and some suitable
integer N ∈ {1, ..., d} so that ˜Pn is non-zero if an only if
n ∈ {1, ...N }. Furthermore, we can and will choose the
labels γ and n so that the energy level populations pn
from (7) assume their maximal value for n = 1, i.e.,

max

n

pn = p1 .

(44)

Accordingly, the second largest level population can be
written as

max

n

′pn = max
n≥2

pn .

(45)

It follows that ˜Amn in (43) must vanish unless m ≤ N

and n ≤ N . With (2) we thus can conclude that

Tr{ρ(t) ˜A} =

N

Xm,n=1

˜Amn ei(En−Em)t .

(46)

Likewise, one can infer from (9) and (41) that

(cid:12)(cid:12)Tr{B†C}(cid:12)(cid:12)

7

Since ρ(0) is a Hermitian, non-negative operator, there
exists a Hermitian, non-negative operator, which we de-
note by ρ1/2, and which satisﬁes the relation ρ1/2ρ1/2 =
ρ(0). With the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

2

≤ Tr{B†B}Tr{C †C}

(49)

for the scalar product Tr{B†C} of arbitrary operators B
and C (for which all traces in (49) exist), and exploiting
Pm = P 2
m (cf. (35)) and the cyclic invariance of the trace,
we can conclude from (43) that

| ˜Amn|2 = Tr{(Pmρ1/2)(ρ1/2Pn ˜APm)}

≤ Tr{Pmρ(0)Pm} Tr{Pnρ(0)Pn ˜APm ˜A} .(50)

The ﬁrst factor in the last line can be identiﬁed with the
level population pm from (7). In combination with (37),
(41), and (42) we thus obtain

| ˜Amn|2 ≤ pm Tr{ρnXAXPmXAX}

= pm Tr{XρnA ˜PmA} .

(51)

Next, we observe that A ˜PmA as well as ρn from (37)
are both Hermitian, non-negative operators, and that ev-
ery |γi is an eigenvectors of both ρn and X from (38).
Upon employing the basis |γi to evaluate the trace in
(51), one thus obtains

| ˜Amn|2 ≤ pm Tr{ρnA ˜PmA} .

(52)

m = Pm (cf.

With P 2
(35)) and (42) we can infer that
˜Pm = PmXPm. Exploiting the cyclic invariance of
the trace we thus can rewrite the last factor in (52) as
Tr{XB} with B := PmAρnAPm. Since B is a Hermi-
tian, non-negative operator, it follows that Tr{XB} ≤
Tr{B} and by the same steps as before that Tr{B} =
Tr{ρnAPmA}. Altogether, we ﬁnally obtain

| ˜Amn|2 ≤ pm Tr{ρnAPmA} .

(53)

Step 1

In this subsection, we closely follow the line of reason-

ing from Ref. [4]. The main result will be (68).

Due to (38) and (39) it follows for arbitrary density

operators ρ and observables A that

Tr{ ¯ρ ˜A} =

˜Ann .

Together, we thus obtain

˜σ(t) := Tr{ρ(t) ˜A} − Tr{ ¯ρ ˜A}

Tr{ρA} = Tr{(X + Y ) ρ (X + Y ) A}

= R1 + R2 + R3
R1 := Tr{XρXA} ,
R2 := Tr{Y ρ (X + Y ) A} = Tr{Y ρA} ,

R1 = Tr{ρ ˜A} .

(58)

By a similar line of reasoning as in the derivation of

Step 2

In this subsection, we closely follow the line of reason-
ing from Ref. [10], which in turn amounts to a simpliﬁca-
tion of the previous approach from Refs. [3]. The main
results will be (77) and (81).

Denoting the set of unequal label pairs as

G := {(m, n) : m, n ∈ {1, ..., N }, m 6= n}

(69)

and deﬁning for any α = (m, n) ∈ G

Gα := Em − En , vα := ˜Amn ,

(70)

it readily follows with (48) that

˜σ2(t) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(76)

(50) we can rewrite (56) as

|R2|2 ≤ Tr{Y ρY } Tr{AρA} .

(59)

Exploiting that for arbitrary Hermitian, non-negative op-
erators B and C

Tr{BC} ≤ kBk Tr{C} ,

(60)

where kBk denotes the standard operator norm (largest
eigenvalue), the last term in (59) can be rewritten as
Tr{AρA} = Tr{ρA2} ≤ kAk2 Tr{ρ} = kAk2 < ∞ . (61)

The last inequality follows from (4) and (6). Finally we
can conclude from (39) that

Tr{Y ρY } = Tr{Y ρ} =

D

hγ|ρ|γi

Xγ=d+1

and hence from (59) that

|R2|2 ≤ kAk2

D

hγ|ρ|γi .

Xγ=d+1

Analogously, one ﬁnds for R3 from (57) that
|R3|2 ≤ Tr{Y ρY } kAk2 Tr{XρX}

≤ kAk2

D

hγ|ρ|γi .

Xγ=d+1

Next we focus on the two speciﬁc density operators
ρ(t) and ¯ρ from sections II and III A. With the deﬁnition

δ(t) := σ(t) − ˜σ(t)

(66)

it readily follows from (34), (48), (65), and (66) that
|δ(t)| = |Tr{ρ(t)A} − Tr{ ¯ρA} − Tr{ρ(t) ˜A} + Tr{ ¯ρ ˜A}|
≤ |Tr{ρ(t)A} − Tr{ρ(t) ˜A}| + |Tr{ ¯ρA} − Tr{ ¯ρ ˜A}|

Since the number of summands is ﬁnite (cf. (69)), we can
conclude from (72)-(76) that for any given ǫ > 0 there
exists a ﬁnite Tǫ with

(67)

In the last step exploited that hγ|ρ(t)|γi = hγ|¯ρ|γi for all
t and γ, as can be veriﬁed by choosing A = |γihγ| in (2)
and (9).

Observing that kAk is ﬁnite (cf.
(61)) and that
γ=1hγ|¯ρ|γi is monotonically increasing with d and
bounded from above by Tr{ ¯ρ} = 1, it follows from (67)
that for any given ǫ > 0 there exists a ﬁnite d with

for all T ≥ Tǫ.

(cid:10)˜σ2(t)(cid:11)T ≤ ǫ + S

(77)

Next, we consider subsets Gj of G from (69), deﬁned
via the property that all elements α = (m, n) which be-
long to the same subset Gj exhibit identical energy gaps
Gα := Em − En (cf. (70)), while for any pair α ∈ Gj,
β ∈ Gk with j 6= k the corresponding energy gaps Gα and
Gβ are diﬀerent. It follows that the number of subsets
Gj is ﬁnite, say j = 1, ..., J, that G is the disjoint union
of all those subsets Gj , and that each subset Gj contains

a ﬁnite number of elements, which we denote by gj. Re-
calling that g from (12) denotes the maximal number of
degenerate energy gaps it follows that

where, similarly as in (1) and (2), the sums run over the
full range of admitted m and n values. With (7), (36),
(82) we thus obtain

gj ≤ g

Σ1 ≤ max

From the deﬁnition (43) it readily follows that ˜Anm =

sum on the right hand side of (81) over all summands
with m = 1. As a consequence, we can rewrite (81) as

This relation together with (77) is the main result of the

For the sake of convenience only, we have so far as-
sumed that the largest energy level population is given
by p1, see (44). In order to get rid of this convenient but
unnecessary special role of n = 1, we introduce (45) into

Final result

We ﬁrst address the case Tr{ ¯ρA2} = 0. Since A2 as
well as all the summands on the right hand side on (9)
are Hermitian, non-negative operators, it follows that

Step 3

Tr{Pnρ(0)PnA2} = 0

(90)

In this subsection, we closely follow the line of reason-

ing from Ref. [4]. The main result will be (89).

Denoting by Σ1 the partial sum on the right hand side
of (81) over all summands with n = 1 implies with (53)
that

for all n. Similarly as in (50) we can conclude from (3)
that

(9) that Tr{ ¯ρA} =Pn Ann = 0. As a consequence, (33)

Next we turn to the case Tr{ ¯ρA2} > 0 (since ¯ρ and A2
are non-negative, the case Tr{ ¯ρA2} < 0 is excluded). It
follows that

β := g max

n

′pn Tr{ ¯ρA2} > 0 .

(92)

We thus can choose d in (68) do that δ2(t) ≤ β/20 for all
t and hence that

(cid:10)δ2(t)(cid:11)T ≤ β/20

(93)

for all T > 0. Likewise, we can choose ǫ = β/20 in (77),
implying with (89) that

(cid:10)˜σ2(t)(cid:11)T ≤ 2.05 β

for all suﬃciently large T . In view of (66) we can conclude
that

(cid:10)σ2(t)(cid:11)T = (cid:10)˜σ2(t)(cid:11)T + 2 V +(cid:10)δ2(t)(cid:11)T

V := h˜σ(t)δ(t)iT .

(95)

(96)

Observing that hf1(t)f2(t)iT represents a well-deﬁned
scalar product for arbitrary real valued functions f1,2(t),
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies

(94)

(97)

(98)

|V |2 ≤(cid:10)˜σ2(t)(cid:11)T (cid:10)δ2(t)(cid:11)T .

With (93), (94) it follows that |V | ≤ 0.4 β, and with (95)
that

(cid:10)σ2(t)(cid:11)T ≤ 3 β

for all suﬃciently large T . Due to of (75) and (92) we
thus recover (33).

Appendix B

In this appendix we derive the general bound from Eq.

(29) by generalizing the approach of Short in Ref. [2].

We imagine many repetitions of the measurement se-
ries considered in Sect.
IV. As above Eq. (28), in ev-
ery repetition, either ρ(t) or ¯ρ is randomly selected with
probability 1/2 and then used to randomly generate a
measurement outcome ~s according to the corresponding
probability (20) or (21). But in contrast to Sect. IV, the
task is now to guess in every single repetition from the
given data ~s whether ρ(t) or ¯ρ had been used to generate
~s.

This decision problem is a generalization of the one
considered by Short [2] (see also Sect.
III B). It is in
many respects also similar to those considered in Sect.
IV. However, it is crucial to note that it is not identi-
cal and that quantitative statements in one case do not
immediately imply any rigorous conclusions in the other
case (see also Sect. III B). Yet, such rigorous conclusions
are not impossible, as we will now show.

A key observation is that the above speciﬁed problem
assigns well deﬁned, objective probabilities (frequencies
of occurrence) to each of the two “models” ρ(t) and ¯ρ
(namely 1/2 to each of them). As a consequence, the con-
ventional probabilistic (frequentist) approach happens to
coincide with the concepts of Bayesian inference in this
speciﬁc case.

In other words, in every single repetition we are given
the data ~s and we have at our disposition the full knowl-
edge about ρ(t) and ¯ρ, but about nothing else. Now we
are forced to produce a decision based on this informa-
tion. The salient point consists in the observation that

10

for any given ~s the only information of use is the pair
of probabilities pt(~s) and ¯p(~s), following from ρ(t) and ¯ρ
according to (18)-(21). Any other information contained
in ρ(t), ¯ρ, and ~s is of no use for our decision problem.
Obviously (or by invoking Bayesian inference), the best
one can do is to opt for ρ(t) if pt(~s) > ¯p(~s) and vice versa
(any other way of using the two numbers pt(~s) and ¯p(~s)
would not lead to a better decision). In case pt(~s) = ¯p(~s)
we introduce as a third option the answer “undecided”
(alternatively, on could randomly choose one of the two
options with probability 1/2). Counting a correct deci-
sion as 1 and a wrong decision as −1, the success prob-
ability (SP ), i.e. the probability of opting by means of
the above optimal decision strategy for the correct state
minus opting for the wrong state, follows as

SPopt = X~s
+ X~s

pt(~s)

1 + qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)

2

2

¯p(~s)

1 − qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)

2

2

(99)

qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) := 1 if pt(~s) > ¯p(~s)
qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) := −1 if pt(~s) < ¯p(~s)
qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) := 0 if pt(~s) = ¯p(~s) .

(100)

The detailed justiﬁcation is as follows: The ﬁrst factor,
pt(~s)/2, on the right hand side of (99) represents the joint
probability that the random event (ρ(t), ~s) is realized.
The second factor, [1 + qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)]/2 is unity if our
guess was right, zero if it was wrong, and 1/2 if we were
undecided (or randomly picked one of the two options).
Similar considerations apply to the second sum in (99).

Since P~s pt(~s) = P~s ¯p(~s) = 1, it readily follows from

(99) that

SPopt =

1
2

+X~s

pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)

4

qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) (101)

Without loss of generality we can restrict the sum to
summands with pt(~s) 6= ¯p(~s) and rewrite qopt(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)
from (100) for those summands as |pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)|/{pt(~s) −
¯p(~s)}, yielding

SPopt =

1
2

+X~s

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)|

4

.

(102)

Next, we consider the very same decision problem, but
now by employing any of the q-functions from Sect. IV
as follows: If q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) ≥ 0 then we opt with probabil-
ity p+ := q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) for ρ(t) and with with probability
1 − p+ our answer is “undecided” (randomly pick ρ(t) or
¯ρ). Likewise, if q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) < 0 then we opt with prob-
ability p− := −q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) for ¯ρ and with probability
1 − p− we are undecided. Similarly as in (99), the suc-
cess probability of this decision strategy now takes the

form

SP = X~s
+ X~s

pt(~s)

1 + q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)

2

2

¯p(~s)

1 − q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s)

2

(103)

and like in (100) it follows that

11

given set of positive ǫ(j)
ν values the inequality (106) ap-
plies simultaneously for all pairs (j, ν) provided T is suf-
ﬁciently large. Hence, the measure of all times t ∈ [0, T ]
for which |σ(j)
is true for at least one among
all pairs (j, ν) can be estimated from above by

Upon comparison with (104) it follows that SP =
[1 + Q(t)]/2. Since this success probability cannot ex-
ceed the optimal value SPopt
from (102), we obtain
[1 + Q(t)]/2 ≤ SPopt. Likewise, by employing the de-
cision strategy −q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s) instead of q(ρ(t), ¯ρ, ~s), one
recovers [1 − Q(t)]/2 ≤ SPopt. Combining both inequal-
ities implies [1 + |Q(t)|]/2 ≤ SPopt. Together with (102)
this yields our ﬁnal result (29).

Note that in order to derive this result we employed
a diﬀerent decision problem than the one considered in
Sect.
IV. Yet, the so obtained inequality (29) itself is
valid independently of this speciﬁc decision problem.

Appendix C

In this Appendix we provide the derivation of (30)-

(32).

Focusing on any of the projectors K (j)

appearing in
(18) and (19), one readily ﬁnds upon replacing A by K (j)
in (11)-(14) that for any given ǫ(j)

ν > 0

Thus, the Lebesgue measure of all times t ∈ [0, T ] for
which the subsequently derived implications of (111) may
possibly not apply, is bounded by Ttot from (110).

A particularly convenient choice of the quantities ǫ(j)
ν

turns out to be:

ǫ(j)

ν F/Nrep if ¯k(j)

ν = 0 ,

ν > kth

ν )1/2 F/Nrep if kth ≥ ¯k(j)

ν > 0 (113)

(112)

(114)

where the “factor” F and the “threshold” kth are positive
real numbers, whose explicit values will be ﬁxed later.
For the moment, we only require that

0 < F ≤ 1/2 .

(115)

Introducing (112)-(114) into (106) and (110) implies

for all suﬃciently large T that

For any given pair (j, ν) (where j ∈ {1, ..., Nrep} and
ν ∈ {1, ..., NAj }) and any given ǫ(j)
ν > 0, the quan-
tity T (j)
in (108) is the Lebesgue measure of all times

Recalling the notation ~s := (s1, ..., sNrep ) from below
Eq. (19), we divide the set of all possible measurement
outcomes

S := {~s : sj ∈ {1, ..., NAj }, j ∈ {1, ..., Nrep} } (118)

into the two subsets

S′

:= {~s ∈ S : ¯k(j)
:= S \ S′ .

(119)

(120)

12

for arbitrary x in (127). Due to the elementary inequality
ez − 1 ≤ (e − 1)z ≤ 2z for all z ∈ [0, 1] it follows with
(115) that e2F − 1 ≤ 4F and hence with (127) and (133)
that

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)| ≤ 4 F ¯p(~s) .

(134)

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)| .

(123)

Accordingly, Σ′ from (122) can be estimated as

Likewise, the sum over all ~s ∈ S appearing in (29) is split
into two parts according to

Qmax(t) = (Σ′ + Σ′′)/2

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)|

(121)

(122)

Σ′

Σ′′

:= X~s∈S′
:= X~s∈S′′

To evaluate Σ′, we note that ~s ∈ S′, implies ¯k(j)

sj > kth

for all j according to (119) and hence

Σ′ ≤ 4 F X~s∈S′

¯p(~s) ≤ 4 F X~s∈S

¯p(~s) = 4 F .

(135)

|σ(j)

sj (t)| ≤ ¯k(j)

sj F/Nrep

(124)

Next we upper bound Σ′′ in (123) as

according to (111) and (112). With (115) and and Nrep ≥
1 it follows that |σ(j)

sj /2 and with (109) that

sj (t)| ≤ ¯k(j)

sj (t) ≥ ¯k(j)
k(j)

sj − |σ(j)

sj | ≥ ¯k(j)

sj /2

(125)

(20) and (21)
for all j. Thus, all quantities in Eqs.
are positive real numbers, i.e., we can logarithmize those
equations to obtain

Σ′′ ≤ Σ1 + Σ2

Σ1 := X~s∈S′′
Σ2 := X~s∈S′′

pt(~s)

¯p(~s) .

(136)

(137)

(138)

Furthermore, we introduce the following subsets of S
from (117):

x := ln(cid:18) pt(~s)

¯p(~s)(cid:19) =

Nrep

Xj=1

ln  k(j)

sj !

(126)

:= {~s ∈ S : ¯k(j)

sj ≤ kth} ,

(139)

|pt(~s) − ¯p(~s)| = |¯p(~s) (ex − 1)| = ¯p(~s) |ex − 1| .(127)

We ﬁrst focus on the case x ≥ 0. Observing that ln(1+
y) ≤ y for all y > −1, it follows that ln(a/b) = ln(1 + [a−
b]/b) ≤ [a − b]/b for all a, b > 0, and hence with (126),
(109), and (124) that

0 ≤ x ≤

(128)

In conclusion,

|ex − 1| ≤ eF − 1

(129)

where j = 1, ..., Nrep. According to (119) and (120) there
exists for every ~s ∈ S′′ at least one j ∈ {1, ., , , Nrep} with
the property that ¯k(j)
sj ≤ kth. It follows that the union
of all the subsets Sj from (139) reproduce S′′ and hence
that

whenever x ≥ 0 in (127). Turning to x < 0, we observe

follows that

Since ¯k(j)
sj (t) ≤ 2 according to (125) we can conclude
that −x ≤ 2F and with (130) that |ex − 1| < e2F − 1
whenever x < 0 in (127). With (129) we thus obtain

into account (22) and (140) we ﬁnally obtain

|ex − 1| < e2F − 1

(133)

Σ2 ≤ kth Nobs Nrep .

(144)

Similarly as in (140)-(142) it follows with (137) and

(20) that

Nrep

where kth > 0 and F ∈ (0, 1/2] can still be chosen ar-
bitrarily (see below (114)). We thus may choose kth so
that the right hand side of (150) equals ǫ from (117), i.e.,

pt(~s) = X~s∈Sj

Nrep

For all sj appearing in the last sum over ~s ∈ Sj Eq.
(139) implies that ¯k(j)
sj ≤ kth
according to (113)-(115). With (109) and (111) we thus
can infer that

sj ≤ kth and hence that ǫ(j)

sj (t) ≤ ¯k(j)
k(j)

sj + |σ(j)

sj (t)| ≤ ¯k(j)

sj + ǫ(j)

sj ≤ 2 kth . (147)

By combining this result with (146) one ﬁnds exactly as
in (142)-(143) that

Σ(j)

1 ≤ 2 X~s∈Sj

kth

Nrep

Yl6=j

k(l)
sl (t) ≤ 2 kth NAj .

(148)

Like in (144) it follows that Σ1 ≤ 2 kth Nobs Nrep and
with (136) that

Σ′′ ≤ 3 kth Nobs Nrep .

(149)

Introducing (135) and (149) into (121) implies

Qmax(t) ≤ [4F + 3kthNobsNrep]/2 ,

(150)

kth = [2ǫ − 4F ]/3Nobs Nrep .

(151)

Altogether, Eqs.
suﬃciently large T that

(117), (150), and (151) imply for all

Ttot/T ≤ ǫ
Qmax(t) ≤ ǫ

ǫ =

3αN 2
obs N 4
rep
2F 2[ǫ − 2F ]

(152)
(153)

(154)

Finally, we make the choice F = ǫ/3, which is obtained
by minimizing (154) with respect to F . Upon inserting
α from (107) and F = ǫ/3 into (154) and then solving
for ǫ one recovers (32).

As announced below (111), the result (153) is valid for
all t ∈ [0, T ] apart from a subset of [0, T ], whose Lebesgue
measure is bounded by Ttot, and provided T is suﬃciently
large. It follows that T ∗ from (31) cannot exceed Ttot,
i.e. T ∗ ≤ Ttot. Upon comparison with (152), we thus
recover (30).

Strictly speaking, the above conclusions are only valid
if our choice F = ǫ/3 (see below (154)) is self-consistent
with the constraint from (115). Equivalently, this means
that ǫ must be smaller than 3/2. In the opposite case,
i.e., if ǫ in (32) should happen to exceed 3/2, then our
above arguments no longer apply, but obviously (30) is
still trivially fulﬁlled.

[11] At ﬁrst sight, one might think that ¯p(~s) = 0 implies “for
sure” that ¯ρ is incompatible with the data ~s. However,
as shown in Appendix A (see below Eq. (91)), ¯p(~s) = 0
implies pt(~s) = 0, i.e. such an ~s is never realized.
