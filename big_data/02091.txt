Abstract

This paper is devoted to the study of the group Ext(G, H) of all extensions of
topological abelian groups 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 and the group ExtTVS(Z, Y ) of
all extensions of topological vector spaces 0 ‚Üí Y ‚Üí X ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0. We focus on their
behaviour under taking products, countable coproducts, dense subgroups and open
subgroups. Finally, we apply the obtained properties to formulate in a more general
setting some known results in the category of locally compact abelian groups and
to determine conditions in which being a topological vector space is a three space
property.

Introduction

An extension of an abelian group G by an abelian group H is an abelian group X ‚â• H
such that X/H ‚àº= G. In the terminology of homological algebra, an extension of abelian
groups is a short exact sequence 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0. The set of all extensions of
the previous form turns out to be an abelian group and is one of the objects of study of
homological algebra.

In [16] Moskowitz studied for the Ô¨Årst time the homological algebra in the class of
locally compact abelian groups, which we will denote by L. Among other things he found
the injectivities and projectivities of this class. Following his steps, Fulp and GriÔ¨Éth
introduced in [12] the group Ext(G, H) of all extensions 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 in L.
More recently Sahleh and Alijani found several cases in which the group Ext(G, H) is
trivial under various algebraic and topological conditions imposed on G and H ([19],
[20]).

In the framework of functional analysis Kalton, Peck and Roberts provided in [14]
the Ô¨Årst extensive study of the splitting of extensions in the class of complete metrizable

1

topological vector spaces. Several problems involving extensions of diÔ¨Äerent types of
topological vector spaces were also considered by Doma¬¥nski ([8], [9] and [10]). Latterly
Castillo and SimÀúoes ([6]) studied the limit properties of the functor Ext in the category
of complete locally bounded topological vector spaces.

Our purpose is to investigate the group Ext(G, H) of all extensions 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí
G ‚Üí 0 in the class of topological abelian groups and the group ExtTVS(Y, Z) of all
extensions 0 ‚Üí Y ‚Üí X ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0 in the class of topological vector spaces. In sections 3
and 4 we will study the properties of Ext and ExtTVS when we take products, countable
coproducts, dense subgroups and open subgroups. We will apply these properties to the
class L to show that several theorems proven in [12], [19] and [20] can be formulated in
a more general context.

In the Ô¨Åfth section we will use the techniques of section 3 to discuss the following
problem: Given two topological vector spaces Y and Z and an extension of topological
abelian groups 0 ‚Üí Y ‚Üí X ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0, Ô¨Ånd conditions in which we can deÔ¨Åne in X
a compatible topological vector space structure in such a way that 0 ‚Üí Y ‚Üí X ‚Üí
Z ‚Üí 0 becomes an extension of topological vector spaces. This problem was studied by
Cattaneo (see [7]) and by Cabello (see [5]) in several situations in which the completeness
of Z is required. We will show that their results can be proved without making use of
the completeness of Z.

2 Preliminaries

All the topological groups will be HausdorÔ¨Ä. Since we will deal only with abelian groups
we will use additive notation.

Given a topological abelian group G and a point x ‚àà G we will use Nx(G) to denote

a system of neighbourhoods of x in G.

We will denote by œâ the natural numbers, by R the set of real numbers, by P the
prime numbers, by Qp the p-adic numbers and by Zp the p-adic integers. We will use
Greek letters to denote ordinal numbers which will be used as index sets.

Given a topological abelian group G, we will call its completion Ã∫G, analogously,
if f : G ‚Üí H is a continuous homomorphism of topological groups, we will call Ã∫f :
Ã∫G ‚Üí Ã∫H its completion. A topological abelian group is precompact if its completion is
a compact group and it is locally precompact if its completion is locally compact ([17,
9.13]).

A topological abelian group G is called almost metrizable if there exist a compact sub-
set K ‚äÜ G with a countable system of neighbourhoods (see [1, Section 4.3]). Metrizable
topological groups are almost metrizable. A topological abelian group is ÀáCech-complete
if and only if it is almost metrizable and complete ([1, Theorem 4.3.15]). Every locally
compact abelian group is ÀáCech-complete (see [17, Lemma 13.13]).

Given {GŒ± : Œ± < Œ∫} a family of topological abelian groups the coproduct topology on
the direct sum LŒ±<Œ∫ GŒ± is the Ô¨Ånal group topology with respect to the natural inclusions
GŒ≥ ÷í‚Üí LŒ±<Œ∫ GŒ±. If Œ∫ = œâ the box topology and the coproduct topology coincide.

2

We will work with topological vector spaces over the Ô¨Åeld R. A topological vector

space (shortly t.v.s.) is called Fr¬¥echet if it is metrizable, complete and locally convex.

A short exact sequence of topological groups E : 0 ‚Üí H ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 will
be called a extension of topological groups (shortly extension) when both ƒ± and œÄ are
continuous and open onto their images. Two extensions of topological abelian groups
‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 are said to be equivalent
E : 0 ‚Üí H
if there exists a continuous homomorphism T : X ‚Üí X ‚Ä≤ making the following diagram
commutative

œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 and E‚Ä≤ : 0 ‚Üí H

(i. e. T ‚ó¶ ƒ± = ƒ±‚Ä≤, œÄ‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶ T = œÄ). It is known that if such a T exists, it must actually be

a topological isomorphism (the proof of this fact is the same as [9, Lemma A]).

An extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí H ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 splits if and
œÄ0‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 where ƒ±0,
only if it is equivalent to the trivial extension E0 : 0 ‚Üí H
œÄ0 are the canonical maps and H √ó G is endowed with the product topology. Note that
the extension of topological groups E splits if and only if ƒ±(H) splits as a subgroup of
X.

ƒ±0‚Üí H √ó G

If X, Y and Z are topological vector spaces, a sequence E : 0 ‚Üí Y

œÄ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0 is
called an extension of topological vector spaces if it is an extension of topological abelian
groups and the maps ƒ± and œÄ are also linear. An extension of topological vector spaces
splits if and only if it splits as an extension of topological abelian groups.

ƒ±‚Üí X

The following known characterization is essential when dealing with extensions of

topological groups and topological vector spaces.

Proposition 1. Let E : 0 ‚Üí H
(resp. t.v.s.). The following are equivalent:

ƒ±‚Üí X

œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 be an extension of topological groups

(i) E splits.

(ii) There exists a a right inverse for œÄ, i.e. a continuous homomorphism (linear

mapping) S : G ‚Üí X with œÄ ‚ó¶ S = idG.

(iii) There exists a left inverse for ƒ±, i.e. a continuous homomorphism (linear mapping)

P : X ‚Üí H with P ‚ó¶ ƒ± = idH.

In the following lemmas we introduce the push-out and pull-back extensions in the
categories of topological abelian groups and topological vector spaces. We will not prove
these results because the argument is essentially the same as the one used in abstract
abelian groups, with the obvious replacements. For more details see [15, Lemmas 1.2,
1.4 and Theorem 2.1 of chapter III].

‚Üí
X ‚Ä≤ r‚Ä≤
‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 is another extension of topological abelian groups (t.v.s.) that completes
the diagram (1) in the same way, then E and Et must be equivalent.

From now on we will use the notation Et to denote the pull-back extension of an

extension E with respect to a continuous homomorphism t.

Given two topological groups G and H, the set of equivalence classes of extensions
of topological groups of the form 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 will be denoted by Ext(G, H).
We will write Ext(G, H) = 0 when every extension 0 ‚Üí H ‚Üí X ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 splits.

Let E1 : 0 ‚Üí H

ƒ±1‚Üí X1

ƒ±2‚Üí X2

œÄ1‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 and E2 : 0 ‚Üí H

œÄ2‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 be two extensions
of topological abelian groups. Consider the canonical mappings ‚àáH : H √ó H ‚Üí H
[(h, h‚Ä≤) 7‚Üí h + h‚Ä≤] and ‚àÜG : G ‚Üí G √ó G [g 7‚Üí (g, g)] and the extension of topological
œÄ1√óœÄ2‚Üí G √ó G ‚Üí 0. We will deÔ¨Åne the
abelian groups E1 √ó E2 : 0 ‚Üí H √ó H
sum E1 + E2 as the extension ‚àáH((E1 √ó E2)‚àÜG). This operation is called the Baer sum.
The set Ext(G, H) with the operation induced by Baer sum in the equivalence classes
of extensions of topological abelian groups is an abelian group (the proof is essentially
the same as [15, Theorem 2.1 of Chapter III]).

ƒ±1√óƒ±2‚Üí X1 √ó X2

Given two topological vector spaces Y, Z we will call ExtTVS(Z, Y ) to the set of
œÄ‚Üí
equivalence classes of extensions of topological vector spaces of the form 0 ‚Üí Y
Z ‚Üí 0. Taking the operation induced by the Baer sum deÔ¨Åned in the same way, we can
endow ExtTVS(Z, Y ) with an structure of abelian group.

ƒ±‚Üí X

We will say that a complete metrizable topological vector space Z is a K-space if

ExtTVS(Z, R) = 0 (see [14, Chapter 5]).

The following lemma will be very useful. The proof is the same as the one in [15,

Theorem 2.1 of Chapter III].

Lemma 4. Let G, H, Y1 and Y2 be topological abelian groups. Suppose that t1 : Y1 ‚Üí
G and t2 : H ‚Üí Y2 are continuous homomorphisms. Then the following maps are
homomorphisms of abelian groups

Ext(G, H) ‚àí‚Üí Ext(Y1, H)

Ext(G, H) ‚àí‚Üí Ext(G, Y2)

The analogous statement for topological vector spaces and continuous linear mappings is
also true.

3 Properties of the Ext group with respect to open subgroups and

dense subgroups

œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 be an extension of
Lemma 5. ([3, Proposition 3.10]) Let E : 0 ‚Üí H
topological abelian groups. Suppose that the completion of H is a ÀáCech-complete group.

Then the sequence Ã∫E : 0 ‚Üí Ã∫H
‚Üí Ã∫G ‚Üí 0 is an extension of topological abelian
groups.

Theorem 6. Let G, H be topological Abelian groups. If H is ÀáCech-complete then Ext(G, H) ‚àº=
Ext(Ã∫G, H).

Proof. Consider the canonical inclusion I : G ‚Üí Ã∫G. According to Lemma 4 the map

œÜ : Ext(Ã∫G, H) ‚àí‚Üí Ext(G, H)

[E]

7‚àí‚Üí

[EI]

5

is a homomorphism of abelian groups. Let us see that œÜ is an isomorphism.

To prove that œÜ is injective, pick an extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí
H ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí Ã∫G ‚Üí 0 and suppose that EI splits. An easy veriÔ¨Åcation shows that the
œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(G)‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 is an extension of topological abelian
sequence E‚Ä≤ : 0 ‚Üí H ƒ±‚Üí œÄ‚àí1(G)
groups. Furthermore the following diagram is commutative

E :

E‚Ä≤ :

œÄ

/ Ã∫G

/ œÄ‚àí1(G)œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(G)

/ 0

/ 0

According to Lemma 2, E‚Ä≤ must be equivalent to EI. Then E‚Ä≤ splits and applying
Proposition 1 we Ô¨Ånd a continuous homomorphism P : œÄ‚àí1(G) ‚Üí H such that P ‚ó¶ ƒ± =
IdH . Since G is dense in Ã∫G, it is clear that œÄ‚àí1(G) is dense in X. Call R : X ‚Üí H the
canonical extension of P to X. R is a continuous homomorphism satisfying R ‚ó¶ ƒ± = IdH,
hence by Proposition 1, E splits.

To check that œÜ is onto, choose an extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí
Ã∫p
‚Üí Ã∫G ‚Üí 0 is an

H I‚Üí Y
extension of topological abelian groups. The following diagram is commutative

In virtue of Lemma 2, E must be equivalent to (Ã∫E)I hence œÜ([Ã∫E]) = [E]

Theorem 7. Let G be a topological abelian group and let H be a ÀáCech-complete topo-
logical abelian group. Suppose that D is a dense subgroup of G. Then Ext(G, H) ‚àº=
Ext(D, H).

Proof. If D is dense in then G Ã∫D = Ã∫G. By Theorem 6

Ext(D, H) ‚àº= Ext(Ã∫D, H) = Ext(Ã∫G, H) ‚àº= Ext(G, H).

In theorems 3.5 and 3.6 of [12] the authors study situations in which Ext(G, X) = 0
for a Ô¨Åxed G ‚àà L and X varying in a subclass of L. The following corollary is an
application of Theorem 6 on these results.

Corollary 8. Let G be a locally precompact abelian group.
(i) Ext(G, X) = 0 for all totally disconnected X ‚àà L if and only if Ã∫G = (LŒ±<Œ∫ Z)√óRn

for some n ‚àà œâ and an arbitrary ordinal number Œ∫.

(ii) Ext(G, X) = 0 for all connected X ‚àà L if and only if Ã∫G = Rn √ó G‚Ä≤ where n ‚àà Z+

and G‚Ä≤ contains a compact open subgroup having a co-torsion dual.

Proof. (i) Suppose that a locally precompact abelian group G has the property that
Ext(G, X) = 0 for all totally disconnected X ‚àà L. Since ever group in L is ÀáCech-
complete, by Theorem 6 Ext(Ã∫G, X) = Ext(G, X) = 0 for all totally disconnected X ‚àà L.
By [12, Theorem 3.5], Ã∫G = (LŒ± Z) √ó Rn for some n ‚àà œâ and Œ± an ordinal number.
Conversely if Ã∫G = (LŒ± Z) √ó Rn by [12, Theorem 3.5], Ext(Ã∫G, X) = 0 for all totally
disconnected X ‚àà L. Using Theorem 6 we see that Ext(G, X) = Ext(Ã∫G, X) = 0 for all
totally disconnected X ‚àà L.

(ii) Apply the same argument to [12, Theorem 3.6].

In the following examples, we compute several Ext groups:

Example 9. Consider Qd the rational numbers with the discrete topology and D any
‚àº= Œ£a (see
dense subgroup of T. Denote by Œ£a the a-adic solenoid that satisÔ¨Åes Q‚àß
d
[13, 25.4]). According to [11, Exercise 51.7], Ext(Qd, Z) ‚àº= Qœâ. By [12, Theorem 2.12],
d ) ‚àº= Ext(T, Œ£a). Finally, in virtue of Theorem 7, Ext(D, Œ£a) ‚àº=
Ext(Qd, Z) ‚àº= Ext(Z‚àß, Q‚àß
Qœâ.

Example 10. Let G be a product of locally precompact abelian torsion groups. Consider
0 ‚Üí Z ‚Üí R ‚Üí T ‚Üí 0 the canonical extension of T by Z. It is easy to see that [12,
Theorem 2.14] is also valid for topological abelian groups outside the class L, hence we
can consider the classical Hom-Ext exact sequence of abelian groups in this context

0 ‚Üí CHom(G, Z) ‚Üí CHom(G, R) ‚Üí CHom(G, T)

‚Üí Ext(G, Z) ‚Üí Ext(G, R)

CHom(G, R) = 0 because G is a torsion group. According to [3, Corollary 3.15], since
G is a product of locally precompact abelian groups, Ext(G, R) = 0. Then Ext(G, Z) ‚àº=
CHom(G, T).
If we only ask G to be a topological abelian torsion group, the same
argument shows that Ext(G, Z) contains CHom(G, T) as a subgroup.

Theorem 11. Let Y, Z be topological vector spaces. If Y is complete and metrizable
then ExtTVS(Z, Y ) ‚àº= ExtTVS(Ã∫Z, Y ).

Proof. Since Y is complete and metrizable, it is ÀáCech-complete and we are in the condi-
tions of Lemma 5. Notice that if we use Lemma 5 to complete an extension of topological
vector spaces we obtain an extension of topological vector spaces. Having this in mind
we can repeat the proof of Theorem 6 in this context.

The following result generalizes [9, Proposition 4.2]:

Theorem 12. Let Z be a topological vector space and let Y be a complete metrizable
topological vector space. If D is a dense subspace of Z then ExtTVS(Z, Y ) ‚àº= ExtTVS(D, Y )

7

Proof. Proceed as in Theorem 7 using Theorem 11 instead of Theorem 6.

Lemma 13. Let A be an open subgroup of a topological group G and suppose that an
œÄ‚Üí A ‚Üí 0 splits algebraically.
extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí H
Then there exists a group topology œÑ on H √ó G and an embedding f : X ‚Üí (H √ó G, œÑ )

Proof. Since E splits algebraically there exists a group topology œÑ ‚Ä≤ on H √ó A such
ƒ±œÑ ‚Ä≤
that E is equivalent to the extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí H
‚Üí
œÄœÑ ‚Ä≤
(H √ó A, œÑ ‚Ä≤)

Now, consider on H √ó G the group topology œÑ obtained by declaring (H √ó A, œÑ ‚Ä≤)
an open subgroup. An easy veriÔ¨Åcation shows that if we call ƒ±œÑ : H ‚Üí (H √ó G, œÑ ) the
canonical inclusion and œÄœÑ : (H √ó G, œÑ ) ‚Üí G the canonical projection, the sequence
E : 0 ‚Üí H ƒ±œÑ‚Üí (H √ó G, œÑ ) œÄœÑ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 is an extension of topological abelian groups.

Theorem 14. Let G, H be topological abelian groups. Suppose that H is divisible and
that A is an open subgroup of G. Then Ext(G, H) ‚àº= Ext(A, H).

Proof. We will use the same strategy as in Theorem 6. Consider the canonical inclusion
I : A ‚Üí G . According to Lemma 4 the map

œÜ : Ext(G, H) ‚àí‚Üí Ext(A, H)

[E]

7‚àí‚Üí

[EI]

is a homomorphism of abelian groups. Let us see that œÜ is an isomorphism.

To prove that œÜ is injective, pick an extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí
œÄ‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 and suppose that EI splits. Since ƒ±(H) ‚â§ œÄ‚àí1(G), the sequence
ƒ±‚Üí X
œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(A)‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 is exact. The mapping œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(A) is open hence E‚Ä≤

H
E‚Ä≤ : 0 ‚Üí H
is a topological extension. Furthermore the following diagram is commutative:

According to Lemma 2, E‚Ä≤ must be equivalent to EI. Then E‚Ä≤ splits and applying
Proposition 1 we Ô¨Ånd a continuous homomorphism P : œÄ‚àí1(A) ‚Üí H such that P ‚ó¶ ƒ± =
IdH . Since H is divisible we can extend the homomorphism P to a homomorphism R :
X ‚Üí H. Since œÄ‚àí1(A) is open in X and R|œÄ‚àí1(A) = P , R is a continuous homomorphism.
As ƒ±(H) ‚â§ œÄ‚àí1(A), R satisÔ¨Åes that R ‚ó¶ ƒ± = P ‚ó¶ ƒ± = IdH and by Proposition 1, E splits.
To check that œÜ is onto, choose an extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí

where ƒ±œÑ and œÄœÑ are the canonical mappings and E is an extension of topological abelian

(cid:2)(E)I(cid:3) = [E].

Remark 15. In [3, Proposition 3.11] the authors prove that for every ÀáCech-complete
topological abelian group H, if Ext(Ã∫G, H) = 0 then Ext(G, H) = 0. Theorem 6 is a
generalization of this fact. In [2, Corollary 14] it is proven that if A is an open subgroup
of a topological abelian group G and Ext(A, T) = 0 then Ext(G, T) = 0. Theorem 14
generalizes this result.

4 Properties of the Ext group with respect to products and coproducts

Theorem 16.

(i) Let G be a topological abelian group and let {HŒ± : Œ± < Œ∫} be a
family of topological abelian groups. Then Ext(G,QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ±) ‚àº= QŒ±<Œ∫ Ext(G, HŒ±).
(ii) Let Z be a topological vector space and let {YŒ± : Œ± < Œ∫} be a family of topological

vector spaces. Then ExtTVS(Z,QŒ±<Œ∫ YŒ±) ‚àº= QŒ±<Œ∫ ExtTVS(Z, YŒ±).

Proof. (i). Consider for every Œ≤ < Œ∫ the canonical projection pŒ≤ : QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ± ‚Üí HŒ≤.

Given an extension of topological abelian groups E : 0 ‚Üí QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ±

Let us check that œÜ is injective. Take an extension of topological groups E : 0 ‚Üí
pŒ≤‚Üí G ‚Üí 0 splits for
QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ±
every Œ≤ < Œ∫. By Proposition 1 for every Œ± < Œ∫ there exists a continuous homomorphism
tŒ± : P OŒ± ‚Üí HŒ± with tŒ± ‚ó¶ rŒ± = IdHŒ±. DeÔ¨Åne the continuous homomorphism

I((hŒ±)Œ±<Œ∫) = ((ƒ±Œ±(hŒ±))Œ±<Œ∫, 0) and P((xŒ±)Œ±<Œ∫, g) = g. It is easy to check that E is an
extension of topological abelian groups. DeÔ¨Åne for each Œ≤ < Œ∫ the continuous homomor-
phism

Consequently, by Lemma 3, EŒ≤ must be equivalent to the push-out sequence pŒ≤E. Hence
œï([E]) = ([EŒ±])Œ±<Œ∫, which concludes the proof.

(ii). All the steps in the previous part remain valid in the category of topological

vector spaces so we can proceed in the same way.

Remark 17. In [3, Proposition 3.12] it is proved that given a family of topological
abelian groups {HŒ± : Œ± < Œ∫} and a topological group G, Ext(G, HŒ±) = 0 for every Œ± < Œ∫
if and only if QŒ±<Œ∫ Ext(G, HŒ±) = 0. This result is a particular case of Theorem 16.
Corollary 18. Let G be a locally precompact abelian group. Then Ext(G,Qp‚ààP Q
a divisible, torsion-free group for every collection of ordinal numbers Œ±p, p ‚àà P.

Œ±p

Œ±p

Since Qp is ÀáCech-complete, by Theorem 6 Ext(G, Qp) ‚àº= Ext(Ã∫G, Qp) for every p ‚àà P
and

Ext(G,Qp‚ààP Q

Œ±p

p ) ‚àº= Qp‚ààP Ext(Ã∫G, Qp)Œ±p.

Ext(Ã∫G, Qp) is divisible and torsion-free by [20, Corollary 1.5], then Ext(G,Qp‚ààP Q
is also divisible and torsion-free.

Corollary 19. Let be G a locally precompact abelian group. Ext(G, X) = 0 for all
X product of divisible œÉ-compact groups in L if and only if Ã∫G = Rn √ó G‚Ä≤ where n
is a non-negative integer and G‚Ä≤ contains a compact open subgroup K such that K ‚àº=

ordinal numbers and pŒ±, pŒ≤ are prime numbers for all Œ±, Œ≤.

Proof. Suppose that a locally precompact abelian group G has the property that Ext(G, X) =
0 for all X product of divisible œÉ-compact groups in L. In particular Ext(G, X) = 0 for
all X divisible œÉ-compact in L. Since every group in L is ÀáCech-complete, by Theorem
6, Ext(Ã∫G, X) = Ext(G, X) = 0, for all divisible œÉ-compact X ‚àà L. According to [19,
Theorem 2.7], Ã∫G has the desired structure.

Conversely if Ã∫G has the properties described in the statement, in virtue of [19,
Theorem 2.7], Ext(Ã∫G, X) = 0 for all X divisible œÉ-compact group L. By Theorem
6, Ext(G, X) = 0 for every X divisible œÉ-compact in L. Finally, from Theorem 16 we
conclude that the same is true for every X product of divisible œÉ-compact groups in L.

Corollary 20. Let G be a torsion group in L and let H be product of divisible torsion-free
groups in L. Then Ext(G, H) = 0.

Proof. Suppose that H = QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ± with HŒ± divisible, torsion-free and HŒ± ‚àà L for every
Œ± < Œ∫. Since G is locally compact abelian and torsion we know by [13, 24.21] that G
contains an open compact subgroup K. It is clear that K will be a torsion group too.
Applying Theorem 16 and Theorem 14

Ext(G, H) ‚àº= Ext(G,QŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ±) ‚àº= QŒ±<Œ∫ Ext(G, HŒ±) ‚àº= QŒ±<Œ∫ Ext(K, HŒ±).

Finally by [20, Theorem 1.6] Ext(K, HŒ±) = 0 for every Œ± < Œ∫.

œÄŒ±‚Üí GŒ± ‚Üí 0 : Œ± < œâ} be a countable family of
Lemma 21. Let {EŒ± : 0 ‚Üí HŒ±
extensions of topological abelian groups. Consider the coproducts LŒ±<Œ∫ HŒ±, LŒ±<œâ XŒ±,
LŒ±<œâ GŒ± and the natural mappings LŒ±<œâ ƒ±Œ± : LŒ±<œâ HŒ± ‚Üí LŒ±<œâ XŒ± and LŒ±<œâ œÄŒ± :
LŒ±<œâ XŒ± ‚Üí LŒ±<œâ GŒ±. The sequence

LŒ±<œâ œÄŒ±

‚àí‚Üí LŒ±<œâ GŒ± ‚àí‚Üí 0

is an extension of topological abelian groups.

Proof. Straightforward.

Theorem 22. Let H be a topological abelian group and let LŒ±<œâ GŒ± a countable co-
product of topological abelian groups. Then Ext(LŒ±<œâ GŒ±, H) ‚àº= QŒ±<œâ Ext(GŒ±, H).
Proof. Consider the canonical inclusion IŒ± : GŒ± ‚Üí LŒ±<œâ GŒ± and deÔ¨Åne

According to Lemma 2, œÜ is a homomorphism of abelian groups. Let us see that œÜ is an
isomorphism.

To see that œÜ is injective take E : 0 ‚Üí H ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí LŒ±<œâ GŒ± ‚Üí 0 an extension of
topological abelian groups and suppose that EIŒ≤ splits for every Œ≤ < œâ. Pick Œ≤ < œâ.

Take the sequence EŒ≤ : 0 ‚Üí H
EŒ≤ is an exact sequence. Since œÄ|œÄ‚àí1(GŒ≤ ) is open (see [4, Proposition 2, Chapter 5.1])
it follows that EŒ≤ is an extension of topological abelian groups. For every Œ≤ < œâ the
following diagram is commutative

Applying Lemma 2 we deduce that EŒ≤ is equivalent to the pull-back extension EIŒ≤. Then
EŒ≤ splits. By Proposition 1 for every Œ± < œâ there exist a continuous homomorphism
RŒ± : GŒ± ‚Üí œÄ‚àí1(GŒ±) with œÄ ‚ó¶ RŒ± = IdGŒ±. Consider the homomorphism

R : LŒ±<œâ GŒ± ‚àí‚Üí

7‚àí‚Üí PŒ±<œâ RŒ±(gŒ±)

Using the universal property of the coproduct topology we deduce that R is continuous.
Since

Œ±<œâ

RŒ±(gŒ±)(cid:1) = X

Œ±<œâ

œÄ(cid:0)RŒ±(gŒ±)(cid:1) = (gŒ±)Œ±<œâ

we obtain that œÄ ‚ó¶ R = IdLŒ±<œâ GŒ± and E splits.

Let us check that œÜ is onto. Pick a family of extensions of topological abelian groups
œÄŒ±‚Üí GŒ± ‚Üí 0 : Œ± < œâ}. From Lemma 21 we deduce that the sequence

LŒ±<œâ œÄŒ±

‚àí‚Üí LŒ±<œâ GŒ± ‚àí‚Üí 0

is an extension of topological abelian groups. DeÔ¨Åne the continuous homomorphism

P : LŒ±<œâ H ‚àí‚Üí

7‚àí‚Üí PŒ±<œâ hŒ±

and take the push-out extension P LŒ±<œâ EŒ± as in Lemma 3. For every Œ≤ < œâ the
following diagram is commutative

From Lemma 2 and the commutativity of (5) follows that EŒ≤ is equivalent to (P LŒ±<œâ EŒ±)IŒ≤
for every Œ≤ < œâ and therefore œÜ([P LŒ±<œâ EŒ±]) = ([EŒ≤])Œ≤<œâ
Remark 23. It would be interesting to Ô¨Ånd out if Theorem 22 is true for uncountable
coproducts of topological abelian groups. Unfortunately, to prove Lemma 21 it is neces-
sary to use that for every countable family of topological abelian groups {GŒ± : Œ± < œâ},
the coproduct topology on the direct sum LŒ±<œâ GŒ± coincides with the box topology.
It is worth mentioning that Fulp and GriÔ¨Éth proved in [12, Theorem 2.13] that
if {GŒ± : Œ± < Œ∫} is a family of groups in L such that (LŒ±<Œ∫ GŒ±, œÑbox) ‚àà L then
Ext((LŒ±<Œ∫ GŒ±, œÑbox), H) ‚àº= QŒ±<Œ∫ Ext(GŒ±, H) where H ‚àà L and œÑbox is the box topology.

5 Relations between Ext and ExtTVS

Theorem 24. Let E : 0 ‚Üí Y ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0 be an extension of topological abelian
groups. Suppose that Y is a Fr¬¥echet topological vector space and Z is a metrizable
topological vector space. Then X admits a compatible topological vector space structure
in such a way that E becomes an extension of (metrizable) topological vector spaces.

Proof. Metrizability is a three space properties (see [13, 5.38(e)]) hence X is metrizable.
Since Y is metrizable and complete, it is ÀáCech-complete and we can apply Lemma 5
Ã∫œÄ
‚Üí Ã∫Z ‚Üí 0 is an extension of topolog-
to deduce that the completion Ã∫E : 0 ‚Üí Y
ical abelian groups. According to [7, Proposition 2] there exist a compatible topological
vector space structure in Ã∫X and we can regard Ã∫E as an extension of topological vec-
tor spaces. Consider the canonical inclusion I : Z ‚Üí Ã∫Z. The following diagram is
commutative

Since Ã∫E is an extension of topological vector spaces and I is a continuous linear map-
ping, in virtue of Lemma 2, E is equivalent to the pull-back extension of topological
vector spaces (Ã∫E)I : 0 ‚Üí Y ‚Üí P B ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0. Let T : X ‚Üí P B be the topological
isomorphism that witnesses the equivalence of E and (Ã∫E)I. Take in X the topological
vector space structure induced by T . This completes the proof.

Theorem 25. Let E : 0 ‚Üí Y ƒ±‚Üí X œÄ‚Üí Z ‚Üí 0 be an extension of topological abelian
groups. Suppose that Y is a complete locally bounded topological vector space and Z
is a locally bounded topological vector space. Then X admits a topological vector space
structure in such a way that E becomes an extension of (locally bounded) topological
vector spaces.

Proof. X is locally bounded because local boundedness is a three space property (see
[18, Theorem 3.2]). Y is metrizable because every locally bounded HausdorÔ¨Ä topological
vector space is metrizable. Hence Y is in particular almost metrizable and we can apply
Ã∫œÄ
Lemma 5 to deduce that the completion Ã∫E : 0 ‚Üí Ã∫Y
‚Üí Ã∫Z ‚Üí 0 is an extension
of topological abelian groups. Since Z is locally bounded, its completion Ã∫Z is also locally
bounded and we are in the conditions of [5, Theorem 4]. So Ã∫E can be regarded as an
extension of topological vector spaces. From here proceed as in the proof of Theorem
24.

Ã∫ƒ±
‚Üí Ã∫X

Remark 26. Notice that in theorems 24 and 25, when we construct the topological
vector space structure on X, the inclusion X ÷í‚Üí Ã∫X turns out to be a linear map.
Consequently, the multiplication by scalars on X, say ‚àóX : R √ó X ‚Üí X, can be regarded
as the restriction of the multiplication by scalars on Ã∫X, say ‚àóÃ∫X : R √ó Ã∫X ‚Üí Ã∫X.
Completing the topological vector space (X, ‚àóX ) we obtain another topological vector
space (Ã∫X, Ã∫(‚àóX )). Thus the multiplication by scalars Ã∫(‚àóX ) : R √ó Ã∫X ‚Üí Ã∫X coincides

with ‚àóX in R √ó X. Finally, since the continuous homomorphism Ã∫(‚àóX ) coincides with
the continuous homomorphism ‚àóÃ∫X in the dense subgroup R √ó X, we conclude that both
operations are the same.

Corollary 27. Let Y and Z be topological vector spaces.

(i) If Y is Fr¬¥echet and Z is metrizable then Ext(Z, Y ) ‚àº= ExtTVS(Z, Y ).

(ii) If Y is complete locally bounded and Z is locally bounded then Ext(Z, Y ) ‚àº= ExtTVS(Z, Y )

Corollary 28. Let X be an abelian topological group and let œÄ : X ‚Üí Z be an open
continuous homomorphism of X onto a topological vector space Z.

(i) If ker œÄ is a Fr¬¥echet space and Z is metrizable then X is a (metrizable) topological

vector space.

(ii) If ker œÄ is a complete locally bounded topological vector space and Z is locally

bounded then X is a (locally bounded) topological vector space.

Corollary 29. A metrizable topological vector space Z satisÔ¨Åes Ext(Z, R) = 0 if and
only if Ã∫Z is a K-space.
