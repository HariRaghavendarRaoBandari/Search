When impacted by a rigid object, a thin elastic membrane with negligible bending rigidity ﬂoating
on a liquid pool deforms. Two axisymmetric waves radiating from the impact point propagate. In
the ﬁrst place, a longitudinal wave front – associated with in-plane deformation of the membrane
and traveling at constant speed – separates an outward stress free domain with a stretched but ﬂat
domain. Then, in the stretched domain a dispersive transverse wave travels at a wave speed that
depends on the local stretching rate. We study the dynamics of this ﬂuid-body system and we show
that the wave dynamics is similar to the capillary waves that propagate at a liquid-gas interface
but with a surface tension coeﬃcient that depends on impact speed. We emphasize the role of
the stretching in the membrane in the wave dynamics but also in the development of a buckling
instability that give rise to radial wrinkles.

INTRODUCTION

The impact of a solid sphere on a liquid surface is a
scientiﬁc problem that has attracted a considerable in-
terest since the early observations of Worthington [1] of
the dynamics of the cavity formed in the wake of the
sphere. This problem has recently attracted a renewed
interest and the cavity dynamics has been studied in
detail by various authors [2, 3]. Water entry is indeed
an important problem for various applications, including
aerospace science [4] where plane impacts have served as
an early motivation [5, 6], naval engineering [7] or more
recently animal locomotion [8].

In most of the applications cited above, the force ex-
erted on the impacting body by the ﬂuid results mainly
from an inertial response. This means that other types
of eﬀects such as surface tension, gravity or viscosity are
negligible. For an object of characteristic size ri, im-
pacting on a liquid surface (density ρ, kinematic viscos-
ity ν, surface tension σ) with a velocity V , the Weber
number that measures the ratio between inertia and sur-
face tension W e = ρriV 2/σ and the Reynolds number
Re = V ri/ν are very large in the context of these appli-
cations.

The case of small Weber numbers – i.e. surface tension
dominated impacts – has also been studied in the con-
text of the locomotion of small organisms [8, 9]. Small
Weber numbers are obtained for small objects or when
the surface tension is large. The latter situation is en-
countered in particular when an elastic membrane is at
the interface between the liquid and the gas as for a liq-
uid ﬁlled rubber balloon [10]. In this case, the tension
in the thin rubber membrane results from the internal
pressure in the balloon and it can be several orders of
magnitude larger than the typical value for the water/air
interface. Provided that the initial tension is large and
the amplitude of the motion of the surface of the bal-
loon is small, the analogy with a liquid-gas interface is

straightforward. However, in the general case, the ten-
sion in the membrane varies with its local strain typically
through Hooke’s law. Therefore the surface tension coef-
ﬁcient is in general not uniform: it is a dynamical variable
that changes with the longitudinal (or tangential) motion
of the membrane. Similar situations are encountered in
the case of liquid-gas interfaces in the presence of sur-
factants, where longitudinal motion at the interface may
change the local concentration of surfactants and thus
the surface tension [11–14].

In the present paper, we investigate a situation in
which a ﬂoating membrane acts locally like a liquid-gas
interface with a very large surface tension coeﬃcient com-
pared to a liquid-gas interface, such that, for our ex-
periments, the Weber number is smaller than 1. The
Reynolds number is still very large, which allows us to
neglect viscous eﬀects. Gravity can also be neglected.
The membrane is initially ﬂat and tension-free (the small
background stress imposed by the liquid-air surface ten-
sion at the side of the membrane can be neglected). In
this case the surface tension coeﬃcient is not known a
priori, and it results from a coupling between the trans-
verse motion (throughout the text, transverse refers to
the direction normal to the initially ﬂat interface) result-
ing from the impact and the stretching of the membrane
that builds up following the impact. Because of this cou-
pling and because the background stress is negligible, the
problem is considerably more diﬃcult than the classical
problem of wave propagation on stretched membranes
[15]. In the absence of a liquid substrate, the dynamics
has been investigated by various authors in the context of
ballistic impacts [16–18]. These studies have shown that
the displacement in the plane of the membrane and the
transverse displacement are strongly coupled and need to
be determined concomitantly. Furthermore the analysis
has shown that the axisymmetric wave propagation can
be unstable and that wrinkles resulting from a buckling
instability appear.

In a recent paper, we have investigated the two-
dimensional problem [19] of a thin ﬂoating membrane,
made of natural rubber, being impacted by a horizontal
metal rod.
In this context, the stretching response of
the membrane is of the same nature as liquid-gas surface

wave separates a domain where material points are at rest from a domain where they move towards the impact point. The

tension, but shows a surface tension coeﬃcient increasing
linearly with the impact velocity. This two-dimensional
coupled dynamics between the membrane and the liquid
(water) on which it ﬂoats, exhibits self-similar solutions
like the ones observed for a liquid-gas interface [20]. This
surprising fact results from the uniform state of strain
in the membrane, allowing for a straightforward analogy
between an impacted membrane and a ﬂuid interface.
In the present paper, we investigate axisymmetric situa-
tions, for which the simpliﬁcation of a uniform membrane
stress does not hold. Indeed, when a metal ball or a ver-
tical cylinder impacts the membrane, the resulting strain
in the membrane, and therefore the related stresses, are
highly non-uniform, as we shall see.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we de-
scribe the experiments and the phenomenology of the im-
pacted membrane: in particular we emphasize the prop-
agation of two distinct waves, a wave associated with the
in-plane motion of material points of the membrane, that
is decoupled from the hydrodynamics, and a transverse
wave that is accompanied by ﬂuid motion. The wave
dynamics is addressed in details in section III, then the
static membrane equations are solved numerically in sec-
tion IV in order to understand the scaling for the strain
observed in the experiments. Section V discusses the
wrinkling instability of the membrane that develops as
the waves propagate and section VI discusses the decel-
eration of the impactor.

II. EXPERIMENTS

A. Setup

A steel impactor with a hemispherical head of radius
ri = 0.75 or 1.5 or 2.5 mm, impacts transversally a thin
rubber membrane (thickness H in the range 0.15 to 0.30
mm) ﬂoating at the surface of a water tank of dimen-
sions 40 × 40 × 40 cm3.
Impactors are accelerated by
gravity or by a gas gun and they impact the membrane
at speeds in the range 0.3 to 30 m/s. Experiments ad-
dressing the wave dynamics (in particular at low impact
speeds) are conducted with impacting cylinders, that are
suﬃciently heavy to ensure that the impactor does not
decelerate during the experiment. The membrane is a
circular or square sheet of typical dimension (diameter
or side length) of 15 cm. The shape of the membrane is
not relevant since we focus on short-time dynamics, be-
fore waves have had time to interact with the boundary.
The typical duration of an experiment is less than 10 ms
and the dynamics is recorded with a high-speed camera
at typical frame rates of 10000 frames per second.
The membrane is characterized by a stretching modu-
lus Y = E(cid:48)H with E(cid:48) = E/(1 − ν2) where E is Young’s
modulus, ν = 1/2 is the Poisson ratio and H the thick-
ness of the membrane in the reference state. The natural
rubber used in the experiments has a Young modulus
E = 2.6 MPa, and a stretching rate of 500% or more can
be reached. For simplicity and since most of the dynam-
ics occurs at low stretching (below 10% except in a small
area near the impactor), we will assume that the material
response can be accurately described by Hooke’s law (see

MirrorMembraneImpactorAir gun10 mmt=0 mst=0.5 mst=1.5 mst=1.0 ms(b)(a)SpaceTime1 ms10 mm(c)V[21] for references to more complex models in the context
of impacts). A typical value of the stretching modulus
is 720 N/m. Thus, even for low strains  of the order of
10−3, the stresses induced by strains Y  are well above
the stress resulting from surface tension at the liquid-air
interface and the latter will be neglected throughout this
work.

B. Phenomenology

After impact, two waves propagate on the membrane
(ﬁgure 1). They are clearly seen on a spatiotemporal di-
agram showing the position of material points as a func-
tion of time. A material point located at a distance R
from the impact point is ﬁrst reached by a longitudinal
wave front. Behind this wavefront, the material point
moves in the plane of the membrane towards the im-
pact point. The displacement is radial and is denoted
u(R, t). At later times, the material points move in
the transverse direction, the transverse displacement be-
ing denoted w(R, t), experiencing ﬁrst an oscillation of
growing amplitude and later a strong transverse motion
ﬁrst upward and then downward towards the liquid. The
wavefront associated with the longitudinal motion trav-
els at constant speed (ﬁgure 1b). Behind this longitu-
dinal wavefront, the membrane is stretched in a non-
uniform manner:
the stretching increases towards the
impact point. The transverse wavefront travels in the
stretched domain. This out-of-plane displacement occurs
in an area well delimited by a hump, which we use to de-
ﬁne rf (t) (see ﬁgure 2). The transverse wavefront travels
at a speed that decreases with time and its position is well
approximated by the law rf (t) ∼ at2/3 (ﬁgure 1b). This
scaling is typical of surface tension driven ﬂows and it
has been observed for two dimensional impacts on mem-
branes [9, 19, 20]. The coeﬃcient a changes with the
impact speed. This wave dynamics will be discussed in
the next section.

During its extension, the axisymmetric wave pattern
presents an instability and radial wrinkles appear, as seen
in ﬁgure 1a. Such patterns appear frequently on elastic
membranes which are not able to withstand compressive
in-plane stresses [22, 23]. Inside the cavity, wrinkles de-
velop on the curved membrane. The number of wrinkles
does not change as the cavity extends and the wrinkles
extend from the vicinity of the contact with the indenter
to the ridge of the cavity. Outside of the cavity, radial
wrinkles are also present. The number of wrinkles out-
side the cavity is diﬀerent from the number of wrinkles
inside the cavity. We note that there is a transition area
between the cavity and the outer domain on which wrin-
kles are not observed.

III. WAVE DYNAMICS

A. The response of a membrane to transverse

impact

We make the usual assumptions of wave theory (invis-
cid and irrotational ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid) for
which we can use the velocity potential φ(r, z, t). We
assume that the membrane plays the role of an inter-
face and that it can be described as an inﬁnitely thin
sheet whose position is denoted w(r, t) (ﬁgure 2). At this
stage of the problem we assume that the problem is ax-
isymmetric. The velocity potential veriﬁes the continuity
equation ∆φ = 0 in the ﬂuid domain. At the interface,
z = w(r, t), the kinematic boundary condition reads

∂tw + ∂rw ∂rφ = ∂zφ.

To describe the longitudinal wave that propagates
ahead of the transverse perturbation, we ﬁrst consider
the case of in-plane displacement, with w = 0, for which
the motion of the membrane is not coupled to the ﬂuid
(because viscous eﬀects are neglected). Then γ = 0 and
assuming a Hookean behaviour of the membrane,

Ns = Y (s + νθ), Nθ = Y (θ + νs),

equation (3) reads, in the limit of small strains, i.e. for

FIG. 3. Positions of the transverse front for diﬀerent impact
speeds for a membrane of thickness h = 0.21 mm struck by an
impactor of radius ri = 2.5 mm. The scaling law rf = at2/3 is
robust with a coeﬃcient a increasing with the impact speed.

Equations (10) and (11) are the normal and tangential
equilibrium equations for the membrane element respec-
tively. Equation (10) is also a dynamic boundary condi-
tion for the ﬂuid motion, coupled with Bernoulli equation
(2) through the pressure p. We note that the assumption
(ii) cannot be made in the absence of ﬂuid. This case
of the impact on a free membrane has been addressed
before [16–18].

It is instructive to consider the case of a constant and
uniform tension Ns. The ﬂuid pressure is related to the
shape of the membrane through

with c2 = (E(cid:48)/ρs). This equation describes the propa-
gation of a longitudinal (i.e., in-plane) perturbation at
speed c, which is a material constant, observed in the
experiment (ﬁgure 1b).

The full set of equations coupling the membrane and
ﬂuid equations cannot be solved analytically. To gain in-
sight into the physics of the waves we make the following
simpliﬁcations: (i) we neglect the left hand side in equa-
tion (3), i.e., we consider that the in-plane stresses are at
equilibrium up to r = ct, (ii) we also neglect the left hand
side in equation (4) in comparaison with the ﬂuid inertia
(an hypothesis that is valid for waves with a wavelength
larger than the thickness of the membrane). We obtain
the following set of equations for the membrane

which is precisely Laplace’s law. Therefore the analogy
with surface-tension driven ﬂows [20] is straightforward.
In particular, dimensional analysis, reveals that at time
t after impact the characteristic lengthscale associated
with the propagation of the transverse wave reads at2/3 ∼

.

Before further discussing the model, we present quan-
titative experimental results on the propagation of waves
and on the strain ﬁeld in the membrane.

B. Experimental observations

The transverse wave front travels with a well-deﬁned
law rf (t) = at2/3, where the constant a depends on the
impact velocity (ﬁgure 3). Therefore, in analogy with
surface-tension-driven ﬂows, we write for rf

self-similar proﬁles shown in log-log scales. The matching of
the self-similar proﬁle with the boundary condition in r = ri
imposes the shape of the proﬁle w ∼ r−1/2 for r (cid:28) 1.

[19], the local strain f depends on the impact velocity
and we shall study this dependence in section IV.

The experiments also show that, for suﬃcient impact
speeds, or for long times, the transverse displacement
w(r, t) is a self-similar proﬁle of the form

where η depends on impact speed V . This scaling is
also characteristic of surface tension driven ﬂows [20].
Figure 5 shows experimental proﬁles of one experiment,
rescaled according to at2/3 (with a determined on the
experiment) in both directions r and z. A unique curve
is obtained away from the impactor. In the impactor re-
gion, the scaling of equation (15) does not hold, since the
vertical displacement is V t, neglecting the deceleration of
the impactor. The matching condition at the impactor
−V t = w(ri, t) imposes the behaviour of the function W
for small r. To obtain linearity with time, it follows that
W (x) ∼ −x−1/2 and choosing η = V r1/2

measurements of the strain at rf obtained by tracking the
position of material points. The circles and disks correspond
to the strain inferred from the prefactor a obtained from the
ﬁt rf = at2/3. The strain is f = (1/α)ρa3/Y where the
coeﬃcient α = 6.1 is chosen to match the direct measurements
of f . Red disks correspond to impacts on a membrane of
thickness h = 0.14 mm with an impactor of radius ri = 0.75
mm (the same conditions as the red crosses). The black circles
correspond to impacts on a membrane of thickness h = 0.21
mm struck by an impactor of radius ri = 2.5 mm (the data
of ﬁgure 3). The dashed line is a ﬁt of the experimental data
f = δW e1/3, with δ = 0.22. The inset shows the direct
measurements of the strain in rf for diﬀerent times (and thus
diﬀerent rf ) at diﬀerent impact speeds (black squares V = 1.9
m/s, red disks V = 4.3 m/s, blue diamonds V = 9.0 m/s).
The strain f is constant.

where f = s|rf is the radial strain in r = rf (t) and α is
a number. Y f is the local tension in the membrane: it
plays the role of the surface tension. Measurements of the
position of the transverse wavefront (ﬁgure 3) reveal that
the prefactor a is, to a good approximation, constant in
time, or at least exhibits a very slow variation compared
to t2/3. Therefore f should be constant in time. Direct
measurement of the strain s = ((cid:96)−(cid:96)0)/(cid:96)0 were performed
by tracking two neighboring material points drawn on
the membrane and measuring the current distance (cid:96) ((cid:96)0
is the distance in the undeformed state). The strain s
measured in rf is roughly constant (inset of ﬁgure 4).
From these observations, we conclude that the membrane
behaves locally, i.e. in r = rf (t), as a liquid-gas interface,
with a surface tension coeﬃcient Y f .

We observe in the experiments that both the coeﬃcient
a3 obtained by measuring the position of the wavefront
and the strain in r = rf measured by tracking material
points f scale like W e1/3 (ﬁgure 4) where

the transverse displacement and the two strains are

w(r, t) = ηrf W (ξ),

s = Es(ξ),

θ = Eθ(ξ),

(17)

where ξ = r/rf and rf = at2/3. The use of the same
self-similar ansatz for all the ﬁelds is dictated by the fact
that the strain s has to be a constant in the region of
rf in order for a to be a constant. Using the fact that
tan γ = ∂w/∂r = ηW (cid:48)(ξ), the full system of self-similar
equations is written in appendix A.

This reduction to a self-similar system provides a clue
as to why a scaling rf = at2/3 is observed. However there
are a few diﬃculties associated with this approach. First,
the boundary conditions at r = ri and r = ct are not
self-similar. This means that a self-similar solution with
the scalings (17) will not verify the boundary conditions,
and in particular the boundary condition w(ri, t) = −V t
which is fundamental in the present problem. Another
diﬃculty associated with the self-similar approach is that
it does not provide a scaling for the strain. In particular,
the dependence of the strain in r = rf with the impact
speed cannot be determined without computing the full
solution of the problem, which remains a formidable task.
We propose in this section, a simpliﬁed analysis.

In order to explore the main features of the wave dy-
namics – the constant character of the strain in rf and
its scaling with the impact speed – we have solved the
quasi-static membrane equations (7) and (11), using a
proﬁle w compatible with the observed self-similar shape
(15). We choose the form

w(r, t) = −ηrf

sin(Ar/rf )
A(r/rf )3/2

,

(18)

where A = 4.38 such that the ﬁrst maximum is located
in r = rf . Apart from the self-similarity, this shape,
and especially the behavior w(r, t) ∼ r−1/2 for small r,
was chosen such that the boundary condition in ri (equa-
tion 16) is satisﬁed. Our simpliﬁed approach consists in
replacing the highly complex coupling between the mem-
brane and the ﬂuid motion with the feature of the ﬂow –
built in equation (18) – that the transverse wave propa-
gates according to rf (t) = at2/3.

Equations (7) and (11) were solved with a shooting
technique, imposing the boundary conditions s(ri) =
θ(ri) and θ(ct) = 0. The solution is shown in ﬁgure
7. The same physical parameters as the experiment pre-
sented in ﬁgure 5 have been used, and the equations were
solved for the same seven times. Figure 7(a) shows the
values of s in ri, rf and ct as a function of the rescaled
time V t/ri. To a good approximation, the strain s(ri) is
linear in time and s(rf ) is constant. Moreover rescaling
the strain s by V t/ri leads to the collapse of curves for
diﬀerent times, as seen in ﬁgure 8. In the light of these
results and seeking an ansatz with constant s in r = rf ,
compatible with equation (17), we choose the following
representation for the strain ﬁeld:

Despite these observations, the complete analogy with
surface-tension-driven ﬂows is not straighforward be-
cause the strain s in the membrane is not uniform, as
seen in ﬁgure 6. Indeed, the stretching s is large near
the impactor and decreases rapidly as r increases. Thus
a detailed description of the full dynamics, including the
ﬂuid and the membrane must be sought for to obtain a
description of the wave dynamics and in particular to ad-
dress the variation of the coeﬃcient a with impact speed.

IV. SCALING FOR THE STRAIN

We ﬁrst remark that the the full system of equations (1,
2, 10 – 7), together with mass conservation in the ﬂuid
bulk ∆φ = 0, can be written using self-similar ansatz
for which all the terms balance in the equations, appart
from the boundary condition in r = ri. The ansatz for

tal measurements.

in a region enclosing rf . These observations are consis-
tent with the fact that the strain is constant in time in
the vicinity of rf .

To conclude this section, we recall the main results.
The transverse wave front observed in the experiments
travels with a well-deﬁned law rf (t) = (αY f t2/ρ)1/3,
where α is a constant and the strain f ≡ s(rf ) de-
pends on the impact velocity through the scaling law
f = δW e1/3. The prefactor δ and the power 1/3 are
experimental observations, but are also consistant with
a quasistatic membrane solution. This solution of the
simpliﬁed problem is obtained by imposing a vertical dis-
placement of the impactor −V t and a self-similar proﬁle
(18) compatible with the experiments. Using this anal-
ysis of the strain ﬁeld, we now investigate the wrinkles
observed in the experiments.

V. WRINKLING OF THE MEMBRANE

As seen in ﬁgure 1, as the waves extend, the mem-
brane presents an instability and wrinkles appear in two
distinct domains, for r < rf where the membrane is out
of its plane and is curved and for r > rf where the mem-
brane is roughly ﬂat (in its nominal state i.e. before the
instability) but streched. We treat these domains inde-
pendently.

A. Wrinkling instability in the ﬂat domain r > rf

The wrinkles that appear outside the cone are also ob-
served in the absence of a liquid substrate [18]. They
result from a buckling instability that is caused by the
motion of material points towards the impactor in the
domain delimited by the longitudinal wavefront located

squares) measured in r = ri, rf and ct, when solving equa-
tions (11) and (7), as a function of the dimensionless time
V t/ri. The crosses correspond to the hoop strain θ in rf .
The parameters used in the simulation are similar to those of
ﬁgure 5. Note that the strain s in rf varies slowly with time
and its value shows quantitative agreement with the value
9.0 × 10−2 expected from the experiment. (b) Longitudinal

ilar form (with a diﬀerent prefactor). The scaling in
(r/ri)−3/2 agrees with the results in ﬁgure 7(b) and 8
and with the measurements presented in ﬁgure 6. It is
also compatible with the self-similar scaling of equation
(17): taking t = (rf /a)3/2 in equation (19) yields

which is not only compatible with the experimental ﬁt
f = δW e1/3 as a scaling law – as seen in ﬁgure 4 – but
also in a quantitative manner through the prefactor. This
fact is clearly conﬁrmed in ﬁgure 8, where the prefactor
δ3α, where α = 6.1 and
β has been determined as β =
δ = 0.22 are inferred from the experiments (see ﬁgure 4).
Equation (19) with this value for β ﬁts well the numerical
values of the strain as a function of r/ri in a wide region
including rf .
The form (19) is valid on a large domain includ-
ing rf but not near the impactor (r >∼ ri) as seen
in ﬁgure 8. Looking for a generalization of equation
(19), we postulate that the strains behave like s(r, t) =
(V t/ri)Es (r/ri) and θ(r, t) = (V t/ri)Eθ (r/ri). We re-
call that these time and space dependancies are com-
patible with the self-similarity observed experimentally,
provided the function Es and Eθ scale like equation (19)

with diﬀerent wavenumbers. The wrinkles outside the cavity have a well deﬁned wavelength and as the wave propagates new
wrinkles appear (see arrow). (c) The wavelength of wrinkles outside the cavity agrees decreases impact speed according to
equation (23). (d) The number of wrinkles inside the cavity is diﬀerent from the number of wrinkles outside the cavity. It does

in ct and the transverse wave front located in rf . As
a result of the radial motion of the material points, a
compressive hoop stress θ develops. This instability
has been described by Vermorel et al.
[18] in the ab-
sence of the liquid substrate and we adapt the analysis
to describe the present case. As discussed in section IV
the strain near rf is roughly constant with the scaling
θ ∼ s ∼ W e1/3 (ﬁgure 4). We consider the simple
problem of a beam of unit lateral length submitted to the
hoop stress σθ = E(cid:48)θ < 0: the beam here represents the
unfolded (i.e. uncurved) annulus near the radius r >∼ rf .
The dispersion relation for a transverse perturbation on
the beam [24] (not accounting for added mass) is

ρhω2 = σθhk2 +

(22)
and the critical wavenumber is thus given by hkc ∼
(|σθ|/E(cid:48))1/2, leading to a wavenumber of the instability

(23)

This result agrees with our observations as seen in ﬁgure
9c. We note also that, as in the absence of substrate, the
wrinkling instability selects a wavelength, rather than a
number of wrinkles. Thus as the waves propagate, new
wrinkles appear (ﬁgures 1 and 9).

B. Wrinkling instability in the cavity r < rf

Wrinkles are also observed inside the cavity unlike in
the absence of a liquid substrate where they are not ob-
served at least for moderate impact speed (compared to
the speed of sound waves in the material) [18, 21]. During
an experiment the number of wrinkles n observed in the
cavity tends to decrease as waves propagate. The num-
ber of wrinkles is smaller inside the cavity than outside
the cavity: in the last frame of ﬁgure 9 a, the estimated
number of wrinkles is 24 inside the cavity and 42 out-
side (near rf ). Moreover, the variations of n with the
Weber number and with the thickness h do not agree
with the scaling law (23).
In particular, the variation
of the wavelength with the thickness of the membrane
shows a much weaker variation with the thickness h if
any. Such behaviour, and in particular the weak de-
pendence of wavelength with thickness, are observed for
patterns selected far above the threshold of buckling in
stressed membranes [25]. We propose here an analysis
of the pattern for a ﬁnite amplitude of the modulation
of the transverse displacement. We write the transverse
displacement (at a given time)

w(r, θ) = w0(r) + f (r) cos(nθ)

This is a geometrical relation between the amplitude of
the pattern f and its wavenumber n. After having expe-
rienced a buckling instability, the membrane is bent. The
change of elastic energies associated with the wrinkling
take the form of a bending energy for which the strain is
(hκθ) where κθ ∼ (1/r2)∂2w/∂θ2 is the curvature

the Weber number and r(cid:63)

the expected W e−1/6. This discrepancy between the sim-
pliﬁed model and the experimental results may be the
consequence of higher order corrections in ratio s/θ.
The quasistatic analysis used in section IV indicates that
the ratio s/|θ| increases weakly with the Weber number
(s/|θ| ≈ (1 + s W e1/3) where s <∼ 1 is a number).

VI. DECELERATION OF THE IMPACTOR

The propagation of waves on the membrane and in the
ﬂuid is associated with a transfer of momentum from the
impacting object. As a result, the impactor decelerates.
The dynamics of the membrane as the sphere decelerates
is shown in ﬁgure 10. For the three impact speeds pre-
sented in the ﬁgure, the shapes of the membrane exhibit
signiﬁcant diﬀerences: at low impact speed the angle γ
remains moderate, while at intermediate and high im-
pact speeds the angle at the contact with the impactor
(r = ri) reaches π/2. At high impact speeds (ﬁgure 10c)
the shape of the cavity is similar to the case of a non-
wetting sphere impacting a water surface (except for the
absence of pinch-oﬀ) [2]. This behaviour is characteristic
of high Weber numbers (here W e = 3.4). After impact,
the sphere decelerates until it stops and then rebounds.
Figure 10d shows that the maximal penetration grows
linearly with the impact speed. For moderate and high
speeds, the time at which the maximal penetration oc-
curs does not change signiﬁcantly with impact speed as
seen in the inset of ﬁgure 10e where the vertical position
of the impactor has been plotted as a function of time,
for diﬀerent values of the impact speed.

In order to make a simpliﬁed analysis of the motion of
the sphere, we write the equation for the position z of
the impactor

where m is the mass of the impactor and Fi the force
exerted by the impactor on the membrane. The simplest
form for the force is to assume a quasistatic behavior of
the membrane and to write the force

Fi = 2πriY i sin γ(ri, t) ≈ 2πY kz(t)

(32)

where we have used the result of section IV, s(ri, t) =
kV t/ri with V t = z(t) and k = Es(1). We have also
made the approximation sin γ(ri, t) = 1 which is valid if
the impact speed is not too small. Most importantly, we
have assumed that the pressure impulse occurring just
after impact could be neglected in comparaison with the
tension in the membrane. This hypothesis comes from
the fact that the impact force scales like r2
i , whereas the
tension scales like ri. As a consequence, we expect Fi to
be much larger than the impact force, as soon as i is
non-negligeable.

The selected number of wrinkles observed in the exper-
iment actually shows no clear variation with the thick-
ness h, whereas the radius at which wrinkles are observed
scales linearly with the thickness in agreement with the
present analysis (ﬁgure 9). We note however that the
model does not capture the weak dependance of the num-
ber of wrinkles with the Weber number: n increases with

The time scale obtained from the experiments, as the
slope of the curves in ﬁgure 10d is in fair agreement with
the time scale deduced from the quasi-static model: for
the data set D1, we ﬁnd τ ≈ 1.11 ms from the experi-
ments (solid line in ﬁgure 10d), which yields k ≈ 0.070 in
fair agreement with k = s(ri, t)ri/V t = Es(1) ≈ 0.05,
as seen in ﬁgure 8. With k ≈ 0.070 the other data
sets are well approximated by the lines zmax = V τ
(shown as dashed lines in ﬁgure 10d) where τ is com-
puted from equation (33) with the corresponding values
of the mass m and thickness h. Solution (33) is in qual-
itative agreement with the rescaled experimental curves
(ﬁgure 10e), apart from the position of the maximum.
We also note that a discrepancy is observed for the lower
speeds, caused by the variations of γ not accounted for
in the simpliﬁed model. It is also worth mentioning that
after its deceleration, the sphere is accelerated by the
membrane and ﬁnally ejected. Therefore we can mea-
sure a coeﬃcient of restitution. The deceleration and re-
bound dynamics is presented in ﬁgure 11. The coeﬃcient
of restitution increases with impact speed and seems to
have an asymptotic ﬁnite value as V → 0. These features
are also observed in the case of impact of non-wetting
spheres on a water surface [26].

It is interesting to compare the dynamics of the ﬂoat-
ing membrane to the case of an impacted plate. In the
present case, the stretching at the contact with the im-
pactor, that will ultimately (for high speeds) be respon-
sible for the puncturing of the membrane, increases pro-
gressively with time with a time scale ri/V while the de-
celeration occurs at a time scale ∼ (m/Y )1/2. This is dif-
ferent from the case of an impacted plate of thickness h,
characterized by its bending rigidity, where the nominal
curvature V /(ch) is reached very rapidly, within the short
time necessary to establish the Hertzian response of the
plate: this time is typically tH ∼ (h/c)(c/V )1/3(h/ri)1/3
[27].

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the behaviour of a membrane ﬂoating
on a liquid pool impacted by a rigid object. The mem-
brane is initially stress free. Tension in the membrane
develops as a result of the impact and the dynamics of
the transverse wave is coupled with the tension wave. We
have shown that the strain distribution – and therefore
the stress distribution – observed in the experiments on
the membrane is fully consistent with a simpliﬁed the-
oretical model. This model consists in the assumptions
that the transverse wave front travels in the radial direc-
tion with a t2/3 law and that the membrane is, at each

fairly good in this purpose.

We leave here, as a perspective of this work, a deeper
experimental study of the deceleration of the impactor
and the wrinkles growth.
In order to conclude on this
aspect, we shall need to change the material proper-
ties (thickness of the membrane and Young’s modulus,
though the domain of variations is limited by the bending
response that will unavoidably aﬀects the wave dynamics
for thick or rigid membranes) and the liquid properties
(density, kinematic viscosity) in order to disentangle this
complex long-time dynamics. One remaining open ques-
tion that this future work should address is the amount
of energy transfer during the impact. Indeed, quantify-
ing the energy transferred into kinetic energy (inside the
ﬂuid) and elastic energy (in the membrane) should have
many applications.

to describe the shape of the membrane in the region of
the transverse wave as a self-similar function, analog to
surface-tension-dominated free-surface ﬂows. The equiv-
alent local surface tension coeﬃcient, derived from the
theory, is constant in time and increases like the Weber
number to the power 1/3 as observed in the experiments.
Moreover, the theoretical expression for the strain in the
transverse wave region gives a scaling for the wavelength
of the wrinkles observed at long-time, which is in agree-
ment with the experiments. Finally, the model allows
us to understand the deceleration of the impactor : the
agreement between the theory and the experiments is
