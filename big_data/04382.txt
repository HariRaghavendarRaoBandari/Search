SOME RESULTS ON GENERALIZED MULTIPLICATIVE PERFECT NUMBERS

ALEXANDRE LAUGIER, MANJIL P. SAIKIA, AND UPAM SARMAH

Abstract. In this article, we deﬁne k-multiplicatively e-perfect numbers and k-multiplicatively e-superperfect
numbers and prove some results on them. We also characterize the k-T0T ∗-perfect numbers deﬁned by Das
and Saikia (2013) in details.

1. Introduction

A natural number n is said to be perfect (A000396) if the sum of all aliquot divisors of n is equal to
n. Or equivalently, σ(n) = 2n, where σ(k) is the sum of the divisors of k.
It is a well known result of
Euler-Euclid that the form of even perfect numbers is n = 2kp, where p = 2k+1 − 1 is a Mersenne prime and
k ≥ 1. Till date, no odd perfect number is known, and it is believed that none exists. Moreover n is said to
be super-perfect if σ(σ(n)) = 2n. It was proved by Suryanarayana-Kanold [4, 8] that the general form of
such super-perfect numbers are n = 2k, where 2k+1− 1 is a Mersenne prime and k ≥ 1. No odd super-perfect
numbers are known till date. Unless, otherwise mentioned all n considered in this paper will be a natural
number and d(n) will be the number of divisors of n. We also denote by J1, nK, the set {1, 2, . . . , n} and by
N∗, the set N ∪ {0}.
Let T (n) denote the product of all the divisors of n. A multiplicatively perfect number (A007422) is
a number n such that T (n) = n2 and n is called multiplicatively super-perfect if T (T (n)) = n2. S´andor
[5] characterized such numbers and also numbers called k-multiplicatively perfect numbers, which are
numbers n, such that T (n) = nk for k ≥ 2. In this article we shall give some results on other classes of
perfect numbers deﬁned by various authors as well as by us. For a general introduction to such numbers, we
refer the readers to the article [3], which contains various references to the existing literature.

2. k-multiplicatively e-perfect and superperfect numbers
S´andor [6] studied the multiplicatively e-perfect numbers deﬁned below. If n = pa1

is the prime
factorization of n > 1, a divisor d of n is called an exponential divisor (or, e-divisor for short) if d =
pb1
1 ··· pbr
r with bi | ai for i = 1, . . . , r. This notion is due to Straus and Subbarao [7]. Let σe(n) denote
the sum of e-divisors of n, then Straus and Subbarao deﬁne n as exponentially perfect (or, e-perfect for
short) (A054979) if σe(n) = 2n. They proved that there are no odd e-perfect numbers, and for each r, such
numbers with r prime factors are ﬁnite. We refer the reader to the article [6] for some historical comments
and results related to such e-perfect numbers.

r

Let Te(n) denote the product of all the e-divisors of n. Then n is called multiplicatively e-perfect if
Te(n) = n2 and multiplicatively e-superperfect if Te(Te(n)) = n2. The main result of S´andor [6] is the
following.

Theorem 1 (S´andor, [6] Theorem 2.1). n is multiplicatively e-perfect if and only if n = pa, where p is a
prime and a is an ordinary perfect number. n is multiplicatively e-superperfect if and only if n = pa, where
p is a prime and a is an ordinary superperfect number, that is σ(σ(a)) = 2a.

A. LAUGIER, M. P. SAIKIA, AND U. SARMAH

Inspired by the work of others in introducing generalized multiplicative perfect numbers, we now introduce
the following two classes of numbers which are a natural generalization to the concept of e-perfect numbers..
Deﬁnition 2. A natural number n is called k-multiplicatively e-perfect if Te(n) = nk, where k ≥ 2.
Deﬁnition 3. A natural number n is called k-multiplicatively e-superperfect number if Te(Te(n)) =
nk, where k ≥ 2.

Before we characterize these classes of numbers we work on a few examples.

Example 4. There exist 6k-multiplicatively e-perfect numbers with k ∈ N⋆, which have the form (p1·p2·p3)α
provided

σ(α)d(α)2 = 6kα

Before proceeding, we note from S´andor [6] that

(2.1)

Thus, by (2.1), we have

Te(n) = pσ(α1)d(α2)···d(αr )

1

··· pσ(αr )d(α1)···d(αr−1)

r

.

Example 5. There exist k-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers for a nonzero positive even number k.
For instance, by a routine application of (2.1) it can be veriﬁed that there exist

Te((p1 · p2 · p3)α) = (p1 · p2 · p3)σ(α)d(α)2

.

• 20-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)3;
• 24-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)2;
• 32-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)4;
• 48-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)16;
• 64-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)64;
• 110-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)93;
• 168-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form p6
• 216-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)14;
• 234-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)10;
• 252-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)8.

1 · p16

2 or (p1 · p2)27;

In the following, we explain some of these examples. By analysis of the cases above, we notice that
there exist for nonzero positive integers m such that 2m+1 − 1 is prime (and so m + 1 is prime), 8(m + 2)-
multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)2m
Indeed, according to (2.1), we
have

.

and since we assume that m + 1 and 2m+1 − 1 are prime, we have

Te((p1 · p2)2m

) = (p1 · p2)σ(2m)·d(2m) = (p1 · p2)(2m+1−1)·(m+1)

Te(Te((p1 · p2)2m

)) = (p1 · p2)σ((2m+1−1)·(m+1))·d((2m+1−1)·(m+1))
)8(m+2).

= (p1 · p2)2m+1·(m+2)·4 = ((p1 · p2)2m

Moreover, by analysis of the cases above, we can notice that there exist for some odd prime number p,
2p-multiplicatively e-superperfect numbers which have the form (p1 · p2)2p. To see this, by (2.1), we have

Te((p1 · p2)2p) = (p1 · p2)σ(2p)·d(2p) = (p1 · p2)3·(p+1)·4 = (p1 · p2)12·(p+1).

If we can represent p as p = 2mq − 1 with m a nonzero positive integer and q an odd positive integer, then
we have

If q = 3, we have

Te((p1 · p2)2p) = (p1 · p2)2m+2q·3.

Te(Te((p1 · p2)2p)) = (p1 · p2)σ(2m+2·32)·d(2m+2·32) = (p1 · p2)(2m+3−1)·13·(m+3)·3.

GENERALIZED PERFECT NUMBERS

We search a solution such that 2m+3 − 1 is divisible by p = 2m · 3 − 1. That is, an integer x ≥ 1 such that

2m+3 − 1 = xp = x(2m · 3 − 1).

This gives

2m · 8 − 1 = xp
⇒ 3 · 2m · 8 − 3 = 3xp
⇒ (p + 1) · 8 − 3 = 3xp
⇒ (3x − 8) · p = 5.

Since p is a prime this implies that p = 5 and x = 3. Therefore, m = 1 and we recover that

If q is not divisible by 3, then we have

Te(Te((p1 · p2)10)) = (p1 · p2)15·13·12 = ((p1 · p2)10)234.

Te(Te((p1 · p2)2p)) = (p1 · p2)σ(2m+2q·3)·d(2m+2q·3) = (p1 · p2)(2m+3−1)·σ(q)4·(m+3)·d(q)·2

= (p1 · p2)8(m+3)·σ(q)·d(q)·(2m+3−1).

We search a solution such that 2m+3 − 1 is divisible by p. That is, an integer y ≥ 1 such that

2m+3 − 1 = yp = y(2mq − 1).

This will reduce to

If q > 7, then 8 − q < 0 where as (qy − 8) · p > 0. We reach a contradiction meaning that the only possible
values of q are 1, 5, 7. If q = 1, then we have (y − 8) · p = 7. This implies that p = 7, y = 9 and m = 3 and
so on

(qy − 8) · p = 8 − q.

If q = 5, 7, then we get no integral solutions for y.

Te(Te((p1 · p2)2p)) = (p1 · p2)8·6·63 = ((p1 · p2)14)216.

Now, we characterize some of these classes of numbers in the following theorems.

Theorem 6. If n = pa, where p is a prime and a is a k-perfect number, then n is k-multiplicatively e-perfect.
If n = pa, where p is a prime and a is a k-superperfect number, then n is k-multiplicatively e-superperfect.

Proof. We know from S´andor [6], that if n = pa where p is a prime and a is a non-zero positive integer, then
we have

So, if n = pa where p is a prime and a is a k-perfect number, then

Te(n) = pσ(a).

and so

σ(a) = ka,

Te(n) = pka = nk.

Moreover, if n = pa where p is a prime and a is a non-zero positive integer, then we have

So, if n = pa where p is a prime and a is a k-perfect number, then

Te(Te(n)) = Te(pσ(a)) = pσ(σ(a)).

and so

σ(σ(a)) = ka,

Te(Te(n)) = pka = nk.

Theorem 7. Let p be a prime number and let n = pα1
r , with r ∈ N∗ be the prime factorisation of an
integer n > 1 where pi with i ∈ J1, rK are prime numbers and αi ∈ N∗ for all i ∈ J1, rK. n is p-multiplicatively
e-perfect if and only if for each i ∈ J1, rK, we have

In particular, if r = 1, then α1|σ(α1) and we have

We now assume that r ≥ 2. We have

(2.2)

Te(n) = np ⇔

Clearly, if for each i ∈ J1, rK, we have

and

αi = gcd(αi, σ(αi)) Y

d(αj )

j∈J1,rK\{i}

then it can be easily veriﬁed that (2.2) is satisﬁed.

Now we notice that if all αi (i ∈ J1, rK) are equal to 1, then (2.2) is consistent only if p = 1. It is impossible

since p is a prime number. If at least an αi is equal to 1, say α1 = 1, then from (2.2), we have

Then one of d(α2), . . . , d(αr) is equal to the prime p and the others are equal to 1. Say

d(α2)··· d(αr) = p.

and

It implies that

d(α2) = p,

d(α3) = ··· = d(αr) = 1.

Then the equation σ(α2)d(α1)d(α3)··· d(αr) = pα2 of (2.2) gives σ(α2) = pα2. But, for all i ∈ J1, rK\{1, 2},
the equation σ(αi)d(α1)d(α2)··· d(αr) = pαi of (2.2) gives σ(αi) = αi which is not possible since we know
that σ(αi) ≥ αi + 1. So, we must have αi ≥ 2 for all i ∈ J1, rK. Thus,

α1 = α3 = ··· = αr = 1.

d(αj) ≥ 2r−1.

Let gi = gcd(αi, σ(αi)) for all i ∈ J1, rK. So, for each i ∈ J1, rK, there exists two non-zero positive integer
ai, si such that αi = giai and σ(αi) = gisi with gcd(ai, si) = 1. Notice that si > 1. Otherwise, we would
have σ(αi)|αi, a contradiction.

Using the fact that p is a prime and si > 1, we have that k = 1 and we get Y

p = si. Therefore σ(αi) = gip and gcd(p, ai) = 1. Moreover, since σ(αi) ≥ αi + 1, we have

d(αj ) = ai, and

gi(p − ai) ≥ 1

implying that p > ai.

and

gcd(α, σ(α)) = gcd(18, 39) = gcd(3 · 6, 3 · 13) = 3 · gcd(6, 13) = 3 6= α

At this stage, we notice that Theorem 7 can be applied. Let us verify that it is the case. We have

gcd(α, σ(α)) · d(α) = 3 · 6 = 18 = α.

Remark 10. Let n = pα1
i ∈ J1, rK are prime numbers and αi ∈ N∗ for all i ∈ J1, rK. If all αi are primes, then we have

r with r ∈ N∗ be the prime factorisation of an integer n > 1 where pi with

σ(αi) = αi + 1,

and

d(αi) = 2.

Notice that in such a case, Theorem 7 cannot be applied since σ(αi) is not divisible by αi for all i ∈ J1, rK.
From (2.1) we have,

If r = 1, then Te(n) = np1 = p1+α1. If r ≥ 2 and if αi = 2 for all i ∈ J1, rK, then n is a perfect square and
we have

and

n = (p1 ··· pr)2,
Te(n) = n1+2r−2
.

In particular, if r = 2, then Te(n) = n2 meaning that n is multiplicatively e-perfect number.

We now prove a result related to the bounds on the prime p in Theorem 7. For that we will need a few

lemmas which we present below.

Lemma 11. For a positive integer n, let π(n) denotes the number of prime divisors less than or equal to n.
Then,

π(n) < 1.25506n/ ln(n).

Lemma 12. For all n ≥ 2, 2n > n.
Lemma 13. A positive integer n can’t have two distinct prime divisors pm and pn such that n > pm, pn ≥
√n. If pk ≥ √n is a prime factor of n then the power of pk in the prime factorization of n is at most 1.

The proofs of the above three lemmas can be found in any standard book on analytic number theory, for

example [1].
Lemma 14. For a positive integer n, d(n) < 2(n + 1)1.25506√n/ ln(√n).
r be the prime factorization of n. Now let pr ≥ √n. Then by Lemma 13, ar = 0
Proof. Let n = pa1
or 1 and p1, p2 ··· pr−1 < √n. That is there are at least r − 1 primes less than √n. Then r − 1 ≤ π(√n).
But Lemma 11 gives, π(√n) < 1.25506√n/ ln(√n). Then obviously,
r − 1 < 1.25506√n/ ln(√n).
(2.3)
Again notice that, for each pi where i ∈ {1, 2,··· , r − 1}, we get 2 ≤ pi. Now by Lemma 12, n < 2n ≤ pn
i .
Thus for each pi, ai < n. That is (ai + 1) < n + 1. For pr, we have ar = 0 or 1. Hence ar + 1 ≤ 2. Now,

d(n) = (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)··· (ar−1 + 1)(ar + 1).

But we have,

By (2.3) we get,

Hence,

(a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)··· (ar−1 + 1)(ar + 1) < (n + 1)··· (n + 1)2 = 2(n + 1)r−1.

2(n + 1)r−1 < 2(n + 1)1.25506√n/ ln(√n).

d(n) < 2(n + 1)r−1 < 2(n + 1)1.25506√n/ ln(√n).

r = Te(n) and by (2.1),

(2.4)

σ(a1)σ(a2)··· σ(ar)d(a1)r−1d(a2)r−1 ··· d(ar)r−1 = a1a2 ··· arkr.

Now we proceed to prove that k > 2r−1. For this, we notice notice that, for any ai, σ(ai) ≥ (ai + 1) and

d(ai) ≥ 2, as all positive integers has at least two divisors. We get the following inequality,
σ(a1)··· σ(ar)d(a1)r−1 ··· d(ar)r−1 ≥ (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)··· (ar + 1)2r−1 ··· 2r−1.

Substituting the right hand side of (2.4) in the above inequality we get,

a1a2 ··· arkr ≥ (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)··· (ar + 1)(2r−1)r

(a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)··· (ar + 1)

or (k/2r−1)r ≥
or (k/2r−1)r > 1 or k > 2r−1.

Hence we have 2r−1 as a lower bound for k. Now we proceed to set an upper bound.

By Lemma 14 we have for each ai where i ∈ {1, 2,··· , r},

2(ai + 1)1.25506√ai/ln(√ai) > d(ai).

This gives,

2(a1 + 1)1.25506√a1/ln(√a1) ··· 2(ar + 1)1.25506√ar /ln(√ar ) > d(ai)··· d(ar)

or {2(a1 + 1)1.25506√a1/ln(√a1) ··· 2(ar + 1)1.25506√ar/ln(√ar)}r−1 > d(ai)r−1 ··· d(ar)r−1

Now substituting the right hand side of (2.4) in the above inequality we get,

That is,

The bounds on p mentioned in Theorem 15 are not tight and there is further scope to work on such

3. k-T0T ∗-perfect numbers

A divisor d of n is said to be unitary if gcd(d, n/d) = 1. Let T ∗(n) be the product of unitary divisors
of n. Bege [2] has studied the multiplicatively unitary perfect numbers and proved results very similar to
S´andor. Das and Saikia [3] introduced the concept of T ∗T -perfect numbers which are numbers n such

n is called a T ∗0 T -superperfect number if T ∗(T (n)) = n2 and it is called a k-T ∗0 T -perfect number if
T ∗(T (n)) = nk for k ≥ 2. Das and Saikia [3] characterized these classes of numbers. They also introduced
the k-T0T ∗-perfect numbers as the numbers n such that T (T ∗(n)) = nk for k ≥ 2. It is our aim in this

Proof. We will examine in detail the cases where k = 2, 3, 9 leaving to the reader the task to verify the other
statements as the proofs are similar.

We ﬁrst prove that all 2-T0T ∗-perfect numbers have the form n = p3

1. In the following, we will investigate

the diﬀerent subcases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.1) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 8; it gives α1 = 3.
• r = 2: (3.1) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 8 which is equivalent to (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 2; it
is not possible since (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) is odd whereas 2 is even.
• r = 3: (3.1) becomes 8· (4α1 + 1)· (4α2 + 1)· (4α3 + 1) = 8 which is equivalent to (4α1 + 1)· (4α2 + 1)·
(4α3 + 1) = 1; it is not possible since α1, α2, α3 ≥ 1 imply that (4α1 + 1)· (4α2 + 1)· (4α3 + 1) ≥ 125.
• r ≥ 4: (3.1) becomes 2r−3 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 1 which is not possible since 2r−36 |1
for r ≥ 4.

So, only the subcase where r = 1 is valid, which means that if k = 2, then n = p3

Secondly, we now prove that all 3-T0T ∗-perfect numbers have the form n = p5
1. In the following, we will

investigate the diﬀerent subcases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.1) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 12; it gives α1 = 5.
• r = 2: (3.1) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 12 which is equivalent to (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 3; it

is not possible since for α1, α2 ≥ 1, we have (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) ≥ 9.

• r ≥ 3: (3.1) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 3 which is not possible since 2r−26 |3

So, only the subcase where r = 1 is valid, which means that if k = 3, then n = p5

Third, we prove that all 9-T0T ∗-perfect numbers have the form n = p17

will investigate the diﬀerent subcases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.1) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 36; it gives α1 = 17.
• r = 2: (3.1) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 36 which is equivalent to (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 9;
there is a trivial solution which is obtained when α1 = α2 = 1, if at least one of the integers among
the integers α1 and α2 is greater than 2, then (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) > 9 implying that there is no
other solution.
• r ≥ 3: (3.1) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 9 which is not possible since 2r−26 |9
So, only the subcases where r = 1 and r = 2 with α1 = α2 = 1 is valid, which means that if k = 9, then
either n = p17

Proof. According to (3.1), we must solve the equation

2r · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 4p.
In the following, we will investigate the diﬀerent cases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.2) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 4p; it gives α1 = 2p − 1.
• r = 2: (3.2) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 4p; it gives (2α1 + 1)(2α2 + 1) = p; notice that the
conditions α1, α2 ≥ 1 imply that (2α1 + 1)(2α2 + 1) ≥ 9 and so in such a case, p must be necessarily
an odd prime number; notice also that if one of the numbers among the numbers 2α1 + 1, 2α2 + 1
is equal to p, it implies that the other number among the numbers 2α1 + 1, 2α2 + 1 is equal to 1
implying that one of the numbers among the numbers α1, α2 would be zero, which is not compatible
with the conditions α1, α2 ≥ 1; therefore, this case is not possible due to the fact that p is a prime
number which is squarefree.
• r ≥ 3: (3.2) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = p which is not possible since 2r−26 |p

Next, we will examine the diﬀerent cases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.3) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 4pk; it gives α1 = 2pk − 1, which proves the ﬁrst statement.
• r = 2: (3.3) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 4pk; it gives (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = pk; in this case,
since (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) is odd whatever nonzero positive integers α1, α2 are, the prime p must
be odd; if k = 1, then we have (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = p which is not possible for α1, α2 ≥ 1 since
p is a prime number which is squarefee; if k ≥ 2, then according to the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic, since 2αi + 1 ≥ 3 with αi ≥ 1 for i = 1, 2, the equation (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = pk implies

10

that there exists two nonzero positive integers a1, a2 such that 2α1 + 1 = pa1 and 2α2 + 1 = pa2 and
a1 + a2 = k, which proves the second statement.

• r ≥ 3: (3.3) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = pk; in this case, pk must be divisible
by 2 and since p is prime, it entails that p = 2; but then αi · 2r−1 + 1 for all i ∈ J1, rK is divisible by
2; that is impossible since αi · 2r−1 + 1 for all i ∈ J1, rK is odd, which proves the third statement.

Next, we will examine the diﬀerent cases beginning from r = 1.

• r = 1: (3.4) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 4k; it gives α1 = 2k − 1.
• r = 2: (3.4) becomes 4 · (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = 4k; it gives (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = k; in this case,
let k = qβ1
s be the prime decomposition of the odd integer k where qi is an odd prime for
all i ∈ J1, sK with s ∈ N∗ and βi ∈ N∗ for all i ∈ J1, sK with s ∈ N∗; according to the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic, we have 2α1 + 1 = qγ1
s where for all i ∈ J1, sK
with s ∈ N∗, γi, δi ∈ N such that γi + δi = βi; since α1, α2 ≥ 1 (r = 2), there exists at least one
integer among the integers γi (i = 1, . . . , s) which is greater than 1 and there exists at least one
integer among the integers δi (i = 1, . . . , s) which is greater than 1; we must have 2 < qγ1
s < k
s = k/(qγ1
and 2 < qδ1
s ) which follows from the
equation (2α1 + 1) · (2α2 + 1) = k; in the following, we set d = qγ1
s and so qδ1
s = k/d;
accordingly, d is a positive proper divisor of k, 2α1 + 1 = d and 2α2 + 1 = k/d; it gives α1 = (d− 1)/2
and α2 = (k/d − 1)/2.
• r ≥ 3: (3.4) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = k; in this case, k must be divisible by
2; which is impossible since k is odd.

Remark 25. We can notice that in Theorem 24, if d is a positive proper divisor of k, then k/d is also a positive
proper divisor of k. For instance, if k = p2 where p is an odd prime, then there is only one possibility for
d which is consistent with Theorem 24, namely d = k/d = p. Notice that in this case, using Theorem 24,

the two results stated in Corollary 22 can be recovered. Another case which illustrates the fact mentioned
at the beginning of this remark, is when k = pq wher p and q are odd prime numbers. Then the positive
proper divisors of k are p and q. In this case, Theorem 24 implies that all pq-T0T ∗-perfect number for odd

whereas 2m+2−rk for 2 ≤ r < m + 2 is even.
• r = m + 2: (3.5) becomes (α1 · 2m+1 + 1)··· (αm+2 · 2m+1 + 1) = k; if k = 1, then it is not possible
since (α1 · 2m+1 + 1)··· (αm+2 · 2m+1 + 1) > 2(m+2)(m+1) > 1 for m ∈ N∗; so, k > 1; in this case,
let k = qβ1
s be the prime decomposition of the odd integer k where qi is an odd prime for all
i ∈ J1, sK with s ∈ N∗ and βi ∈ N∗ for all i ∈ J1, sK with s ∈ N∗; then according to the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic, for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, we have 2αi + 1 = qγi,1

since for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, αi ≥ 1, for given i ∈ J1, m + 2K, there exists at least one integer among
the integers γi,j (j = 1, . . . , s) which is greater than 1; we must have 2 < qγi,1
s < k; in the
following, for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, we set di = qγi,1
; accordingly, for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, di is a
positive proper divisor of k; we have also k = d1 ··· dm+2 and for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, αi· 2m+1 + 1 = di;
provided for all i ∈ J1, m + 2K, di − 1 is divisible by 2m+1, it gives αi = (di − 1)/2m+1.
• r > m + 2: (3.5) becomes 2r−(m+2) · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = k; which is impossible since
2r−(m+2) · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) for r > m + 2 is even whereas k is assumed to be odd.
So, only the case where r = 1 for odd positive integer k and for nonzero positive integer m and the case
where r = m+ 2 for odd positive integer k which has a multiplicative partition whose members are congruent
to 1 modulo 2m+1 for m ∈ N∗, are possible. This completes the proof.

2r · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 12 · (2p − 1)

First we ﬁnd the possible forms of all 3·(2p−1)-T0T ∗-perfect numbers. In the following, we will investigate

• r = 1: (3.6) becomes 2 · (α1 + 1) = 12 · (2p − 1); it gives α1 = 12p − 5.
• r = 2: (3.6) becomes 4·(2α1 + 1)·(2α2 + 1) = 12·(2p− 1) which is equivalent to (2α1 + 1)·(2α2 + 1) =
3 · (2p − 1); a trivial solution is given by α1 = 1 and α2 = p − 1 (notice that a particular subcase
of this trivial solution is α1 = α2 = 1 which is consistent with (3.6) only if p = 2); more generally,
we must have either 2α1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3) or 2α2 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3); without loss of generality, let
us take 2α2 + 1 = 3k with k an odd positive integer which divides 2p − 1 so that (3.6) is satisﬁed;
then it is not diﬃcult to see that 2α1 + 1 = 2p−1
and we obtain for α1 and α2, the parametrisation
α1(k) = 2p−(k+1)
; notice that the subcase α1 = p − 1 and α2 = 1 is recovered
when k = 1.
• r ≥ 3: (3.6) becomes 2r−2 · (α1 · 2r−1 + 1)··· (αr · 2r−1 + 1) = 3 · (2p − 1) which is not possible since

Secondly we see if there exists an even perfect number which is 3·(2p−1)-T0T ∗-perfect number. According
to the Euclid-Euler theorem, an even perfect number takes the form 2q−1 · (2q − 1), where q is a prime such
that 2q − 1 is a Mersenne prime. Accordingly, an even perfect number corresponds to the case where r = 2

Since the prime factorization of an integer is unique up to the order of the prime factors, without loss
of generality, taking 1 ≤ α2 ≤ α1, since 2 and 2q − 1 are prime, we will have p1 = 2, p2 = 2q − 1 with
α1(k) = q − 1 and α2(k) = 1. Using the parametrization introduced above when r = 2, this system is
2p − (k + 1)

both 2α1 + 1 and 2α2 + 1 are divisible by 3, then there exist two odd positive integers k1 and k2 such that

3k , because 3k1k2 = 2p− 1 when both 2α1 + 1 and 2α2 + 1 are
divisible by 3, this subcase can be recovered. In particular, if k = 1, then it is consistent with the statement
of Theorem 29. Notice that if both 2α1 + 1 and 2α2 + 1 are divisible by 3, then p ≡ 2 (mod 3). Indeed,
since k1 is an odd positive integer, there exists an integer m1 such that k1 = 2m1 + 1. Or, 3k1 = 2p − 1. So,
2p = 3k1 + 1 = 6m1 + 4. It gives p = 3m1 + 2. Notice also that m1 shall be an odd positive integer since p
is necessarily prime so that 2p − 1 be a Mersenne prime.
number.

We conclude that 2p−1 · (2p − 1) is the only even perfect number which is a 3 · (2p − 1)-T0T ∗-perfect

(cid:3)

In this section, we have presented results only on the canonical representation of k-T0T ∗ perfect numbers.
Other techniques may be used to derive results on the bounds of such numbers, but here we do not proceed
in that direction.
