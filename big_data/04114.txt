A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CRITICAL CATENOID

PETER MCGRATH

Abstract. We show that an embedded minimal annulus Σ2
⊂ B3 which in-
tersects ∂B3 orthogonally and is invariant under reﬂection through the coor-
dinate planes is the critical catenoid. The proof uses nodal domain arguments
and a characterization, due to Fraser and Schoen, of the critical catenoid as
the unique free boundary minimal annulus in Bn with lowest Steklov eigen-
value equal to 1. We also give more general criteria which imply that a free
boundary minimal surface in B3 invariant under a group of reﬂections has
lowest Steklov eigenvalue 1.

1. Introduction

A classical theorem of Nitsche [11] states that the only free boundary minimal
disks in the unit ball B3 are ﬂat equators. It is not known whether or not similar
rigidity theorems hold for surfaces with larger genus or number of boundary com-
ponents, but in this direction and Fraser and Li [7] made the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1 (Fraser and Li, [7]). Up to congruences, the critical catenoid is the
unique properly embedded free boundary minimal annulus in B3.

The study of free boundary minimal surfaces in B3 has features in common with
the study of closed minimal surfaces in S3 (see [3] for a recent survey on the latter
topic). A natural counterpart to Conjecture 1 in the setting of embedded minimal
surfaces in S3 - Lawson’s conjecture that the Cliﬀord torus is the only embedded
minimal torus in S3, up to congruences - was recently and spectacularly resolved by
Brendle [2]. Brendle’s proof of the Lawson conjecture gives some reason to believe
that Conjecture 1 may be true. One purpose of this note is to prove the following.

Theorem 1. Let Σ ⊂ Bn, n ≥ 3 be an embedded free boundary minimal annulus.
Suppose Σ is invariant under reﬂection through three orthogonal hyperplanes Πi, i =

1, 2, 3 and ∂Σ ∩(cid:16)Bn \S3

i=1 Πi(cid:17) 6= ∅. Then Σ is congruent to the critical catenoid.

As a consequence, we conﬁrm Conjecture 1 under a stronger hypothesis:

Corollary 1. Let Σ ⊂ B3 be a embedded free boundary minimal annulus, symmetric
with respect to the coordinate planes. Then Σ is congruent to the critical catenoid.

Before Brendle’s proof, earlier work of Ros had established that the conclusion
of the Lawson conjecture held with an additional strong assumption of symmetry
with respect to the coordinate planes. In particular, Ros proved (Theorem 6, [12]):

Theorem 2 (Ros, [12]). Let M ⊂ S3 be an embedded minimal torus, symmetric
with respect to the coordinate hyperplanes of R4. Then M is the Cliﬀord torus.

As Conjecture 1 remains open, we present Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 here as
a natural step towards its resolution. Note that Corollary 1 follows directly from

Theorem 1: if Σ ⊂ B3 is as in Theorem 1, it must be that ∂Σ∩(cid:16)B3 \S3

since otherwise the convex hull property would imply Σ ⊂ Πi for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3},
which would imply Σ is a disk. In fact, the methods used to prove Theorem 1 also
lead to a new proof of Ros’ theorem.

i=1 Πi(cid:17) 6= ∅,

Fraser and Schoen have developed a fruitful connection between free bound-
ary minimal surfaces in Bn and the so-called Steklov eigenvalue problem. One
consequence of their work is the following characterization of the critical catenoid
(Theorem 6.6, [6]):

Theorem 3 (Fraser-Schoen, [6]). Suppose Σ is a free boundary annulus in Bn such
that the coordinate functions are ﬁrst Steklov eigenfunctions. Then n = 3 and Σ is
congruent to the critical catenoid.

In light of this result, to prove Theorem 1, it suﬃces to prove that the lowest
Steklov eigenvalue σ1(Σ) on a free boundary minimal annulus Σ with the assumed
symmetries is 1. For this, we adapt a symmetrization technique of Choe and Soret
[5], who proved that the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the Lawson and
Karcher-Pinkall-Sterling minimal surfaces in S3 is 2. A similar technique was used
to estimate the ﬁrst Steklov eigenvalue for domains in the plane with reﬂectional
symmetries [9].

More generally, we use these techniques to give general conditions on a free
boundary minimal surface Σ ⊂ B3 which guarantee that Σ has lowest Steklov
eigenvalue equal to 1.

Fraser and Schoen [6] have constructed a family {Mn}n∈N of free boundary
minimal surfaces with σ1(Mn) = 1 which are characterized by the fact that they
maximize σ1(Σ)|∂Σ| over all surfaces Σ with genus zero and n boundary compo-
nents. These surfaces are expected to have reﬂectional symmetries, and recently
Folha, Pacard, and Zolotareva [13] have described a family of genus 0 and a family
of genus 1 free boundary minimal surfaces with a large number of boundary com-
ponents which are invariant under a group of reﬂections. The genus 0 family is
expected to coincide with the family {Mn} when n is large; our methods show that
any surfaces with these types of symmetries have lowest Steklov eigenvalue 1. This
supports a conjecture of Fraser and Li [7] that σ1(Σ) = 1 for any embedded free
boundary minimal surface Σ ⊂ B3.

In Section 2, we summarize the connection between free boundary minimal sur-
faces in Bn and the Steklov eigenvalue problem and review some facts about nodal
domains. In Section 3, we prove Theorem 1 and indicate another proof of Ros’ the-
orem. Finally, in Section 4, we investigate free boundary minimal surfaces Σ ⊂ B3
with more general reﬂectional symmetries.

2. The Steklov Eigenvalue Problem and Free Boundary Minimal

Surfaces in Bn

Let (Σn, ∂Σ, g) be a smooth compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. Let
η be the unit outward pointing conormal vector ﬁeld on ∂Σ. The Steklov Eigenvalue
Problem is

3

(1)

( ∆u = 0

∂u
∂η = σu on ∂Σ

in Σ

and we call a function u satisfying (1) a Steklov eigenfunction. The eigenvalues of
(1) are the spectrum of the Dirichlet to Neumann map L : C∞(∂Σ) → C∞(∂Σ)
given by

Lu =

∂ ˆu
dη

where ˆu is the harmonic extension of u to Σ (that is, ∆ˆu = 0 in Σ and ˆu = u
on ∂Σ). It is well known that L is a self-adjoint pseudodiﬀerential operator with
discrete spectrum

0 = σ0 < σ1 ≤ σ2 ≤ . . . .

Furthermore, the ﬁrst nonzero eigenvalue σ1 may be deﬁned variationally by

(2)

where

σ1 = inf

u∈C RΣ |∇u|2
R∂Σ u2 ,

C = {u ∈ C0(Σ) : u 6≡ 0,Z∂Σ

u = 0, and u is piecewise C1}.

If u ∈ C achieves equality in the Rayleigh quotient (2), then u is an eigenfunction
with eigenvalue σ1. Hereafter, we refer to such u as ﬁrst eigenfunctions. See [8] for
more information about the Steklov eigenvalue problem.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Suppose u is a Steklov eigenfunction. The nodal set of u is

A nodal domain of u is a connected component of Σ \ N .

N = {p ∈ Σ : u(p) = 0}.

It is a standard fact (c.f. [4]) that when n = 2, N consists of ﬁnitely many C1
arcs which intersect at a ﬁnite set of points. We call a piecewise C1 curve in N a
nodal line. The following Courant nodal domain type theorem is standard (see [4],
[9]). We provide a proof for the sake of completeness.

Lemma 1. If u is a ﬁrst eigenfunction, then u has exactly two nodal domains.

Proof. Since R∂Σ u = 0 and u 6≡ 0, u has at least two nodal domains. Suppose for a

contradiction that u is a ﬁrst eigenfunction and Ω1, Ω2, Ω3 are distinct, nonempty
nodal domains. We ﬁrst claim that ∂Σ ∩ ∂Ωi 6= ∅ for i = 1, 2, 3. To see this, observe
that if there were an i for which ∂Σ ∩ ∂Ωi = ∅, then the maximum principle would
imply u ≡ 0 on Ωi, and the unique continuation principle for elliptic equations [1]
would imply that u ≡ 0 on Σ, contrary to our assumption.

Therefore, there exist nonzero c1, c2 ∈ R such that the function v deﬁned by

(3)

c1u on Ω1
c2u on Ω2
0

on Σ \ (Ω1 ∪ Ω2)

v =


4

P. MCGRATH

satisﬁes R∂Σ v = 0. Then by construction, v ∈ C. Moreover, since ∂v

integration by parts yields

∂η = σ1v on ∂Σ,

(4)

Z∂Σ

σ1v2 =Z∂Σ

v

∂v

|∇v|2 ,

so v is a ﬁrst eigenfunction by (2). In particular, ∆v = 0 on Σ. On the other hand,
v vanishes on a nonempty open set by (3), so the unique continuation property
implies that v ≡ 0 on Σ, which contradicts our hypothesis.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.2. We say the image of a minimal immersion F : Σ → Bn is a free
boundary minimal surface if F (∂Σ) ⊂ ∂Bn and F (∂Σ) intersects ∂Bn orthogonally.

Abusing notation slightly by identifying Σ with its image under F , the free
boundary condition amounts to the condition that η = X along ∂Σ, where X is the
position vector in Rn. Since the coordinate functions of any minimal immersion
F : Σ → Rn are harmonic and the free boundary condition implies ∂xi
∂η = xi, we
have the following.

Remark 2.3. If Σ ⊂ Bn is a free boundary minimal surface, the coordinate func-
tions x1, . . . , xn are Steklov eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1.

The critical catenoid is a particular scaling of the catenoid in R3 that satisﬁes the
free boundary condition. It may be parametrized by Fcat : [−ρ0, ρ0] × [0, 2π] → R3,
where

Fcat(r, θ) =

(cosh r cos θ, cosh r sin θ, r)

1

ρ0 cosh ρ0

and ρ0 is deﬁned to be the solution of the equation ρ0 tanh ρ0 = 1.

3. Proof of Theorem 1

Let Π ⊂ Rn be a hyperplane and let RΠ : Rn → Rn be orthogonal reﬂection
through Π. We say a surface Σ is invariant under reﬂection through Π, or RΠ-
invariant, if RΠ(Σ) = Σ.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Suppose Σ is RΠ-invariant. We deﬁne operators AΠ, SΠ : C0(Σ) →
C0(Σ) by

(5)

AΠu =

1
2

(u − u ◦ RΠ) , SΠu =

1
2

(u + u ◦ RΠ) .

Clearly AΠu and SΠu are the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of u about Π,

i.e., u = AΠu + SΠu and

AΠ ◦ RΠu = −AΠu,

SΠ ◦ RΠu = SΠu.

If u is a ﬁrst eigenfunction, linearity of (1) and (5) implies AΠu and SΠu are
eigenfunctions, in fact ﬁrst eigenfunctions unless AΠu ≡ 0 or SΠu ≡ 0, respectively.

Lemma 2. If Σ2 ⊂ Rn is RΠ-invariant, σ1 < 1, and u is a ﬁrst eigenfunction,
then u = SΠu.

Proof. Suppose for a contradiction that AΠu 6≡ 0. Then AΠu is a ﬁrst eigenfunc-
tion. By Lemma 1, AΠu has exactly two nodal domains; let Ω be the nodal domain
where u > 0. Since AΠu is antisymmetric, its nodal set N contains Σ ∩ Π and the
second nodal domain is RΠ(Ω). Since Π disconnects Σ, Ω lies on one side of Π.

Deﬁne ϕ := hX, wi, where X ∈ Rn is the position vector ﬁeld and w ∈ Rn is a

5

normal vector to Π such that Ω ⊂ {ϕ > 0}. It follows that RΩ ϕAΠu > 0. Since

AΠϕ = ϕ, we have then

ZΣ

ϕAΠu =ZΩ

ϕAΠu +ZRΠ(Ω)

AΠϕ AΠu = 2ZΩ

(6)

ϕAΠu > 0.

On the other hand, Remark 2.3 implies that ϕ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue

1. Since L is self-adjoint and σ1 < 1, then

(7)

which contradicts (6).

ϕAΠu = 0,

ZΣ

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1. Let Σ2 ⊂ Bn be an embedded, G-invariant free boundary
annulus, where G = hRΠ1 , RΠ2 , RΠ3i. Without loss of generality, we may assume
Πi, i = 1, 2, 3 are the ﬁrst three coordinate planes. By Theorem 3, it suﬃces to
prove σ1(Σ) = 1. For the sake of a contradiction, suppose σ1(Σ) < 1 and let u be
a ﬁrst eigenfunction.

Since ∂Σ∩(cid:16)Bn \S3

i=1 Πi(cid:17) 6= ∅, it follows from the symmetries that ∂Σ∩int(O) 6=

∅, where O = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn : x1, x2, x3 ≥ 0}. Let Γ ⊂ ∂B3 be a boundary
component of ∂Σ. Since Σ is embedded, any intersection of Γ with one of the planes
Πi is orthogonal. Since Σ is an annulus, the symmetries imply there is at least one
such intersection.

Now consider the curve γ := Γ ∩ O. Since Γ is an embedded G-invariant circle,
γ is connected, embedded and intersects exactly two (at ﬁrst possibly indistinct)
coordinate planes Πi, i = 1, 2, 3. We parametrize γ on [0, 1] and may suppose
without loss of generality that γ(0) ∈ Π1. Since Σ is an annulus, the symmetries
imply that γ(1) /∈ Π1. Without loss of generality, we can assume γ(1) ∈ Π2. By the
symmetries, the other boundary component of ∂Σ is RΠ3 (Γ). Since Σ is an annulus,
this implies Σ ∩ Π3 is a circle, and moreover that D := Σ ∩ O is bounded by four
arcs γ, e1, e2, e3, with ei ⊂ Σ ∩ Πi, i = 1, 2, 3. In particular, D is a fundamental
domain for Σ.

We ﬁrst claim that N contains a nodal line ℓ which intersects γ at an interior
point. If not, then u would not change sign on γ, and since u is G-invariant and

D is a fundamental domain for Σ, we would have R∂Σ u 6= 0, which contradicts (2).

There are four cases, depending on whether the second intersection of ℓ with ∂D is
on γ, e1, e2, or e3.

By Lemma 2, N is G-invariant. If ℓ ends on γ, G-invariance of N implies u has
at least 9 nodal domains. If ℓ ends on e1, G-invariance of N implies u has at least 5
nodal domains. In the same fashion, u has at least 5 nodal domains if ℓ ends on e2.
Finally, if ℓ ends on e3, G-invariance of N implies u has at least 4 nodal domains.
(cid:3)

Each of these cases contradicts Lemma 1, so it must be that σ1 = 1.

Similar reﬂection techniques were developed in [5] in the setting of closed em-
bedded minimal surfaces in the round three-sphere S3. These arguments together
with ideas from the proof of Theorem 1 above yield a new proof of a result of Ros
(Theorem 2 above).

Proof of Theorem 2. Suppose M ⊂ S3 is an embedded minimal G-invariant torus,
where G = hΠ1, Π2, Π3, Π4i and Πi, i = 1, . . . , 4 are the coordinate planes in R4.

6

P. MCGRATH

Then Π4 divides M into two embedded annuli which intersect the two-sphere
{(x1, x2, x3, x4) ∈ S3 : x4 = 0} orthogonally and are congruent by the reﬂection
RΠ4. Stereographic projection from (0, 0, 0, 1) gives a conformal identiﬁcation

{(x1, x2, x3, x4) ∈ S3 : x4 ≤ 0} ∼= B3.

Moreover, under this equivalence, M ∩ {x4 ≤ 0} maps to an embedded annulus
Σ which is RΠi-invariant, i = 1, 2, 3 and intersects ∂B3 orthogonally. By the
topological argument in the proof of Theorem 1 above, Σ ∩ O is bounded by four
arcs and is in particular simply connected.

Therefore, the inverse image of Σ ∩ O under stereographic projection is a simply
connected fundamental domain for M . We may then use Theorem 2 from [5] to
conclude the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 of the laplacian on M is 2. By a result of Montiel
and Ros ([10], Theorem 4) this implies M is congruent to the Cliﬀord torus.
(cid:3)

4. Surfaces Σ with General Reflectional Symmetries

The results of this section should be compared with those of Section 4 of [5],
where analogous results are discussed for the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplacian on
embedded minimal surfaces in S3. We assume now that Σ ⊂ B3 is an embedded free
boundary minimal surface invariant under a ﬁnite group of reﬂections G. Moreover,
we assume the pair (Σ, G) satisﬁes the following conditions.

(C1) The fundamental domain W for G in B3 is a tetrahedral wedge bounded

by planes Πi, i = 1, 2, 3 and ∂B3.

(C2) The fundamental domain D := W ∩ Σ for Σ intersects ∂Σ in a single

connected curve γ.

If U ⊂ D and U is a
We do not require at ﬁrst that D is simply connected.
connected component of ˜U ∩ D, where ˜U is a nodal domain, we say U is a nodal
domain in D.

Lemma 3. Let Σ ⊂ B3 be a G-invariant free boundary minimal surface satisfying
(C1) and (C2) and suppose σ1(Σ) < 1. Then D has exactly two nodal domains
U and V , and each ∂U and ∂V has nonempty intersection with ∂B3 and Πi for
i = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. Let u be a ﬁrst eigenfunction and let ˜U , ˜V be the nodal domains for u from

Lemma 1. Because R∂Σ u = 0, D is a fundamental domain for Σ, and D ∩ ∂Σ = γ,

u changes sign on γ. Therefore u has at least two nodal domains in D.

Suppose ˜U ∩ D = U1 ∪ U2 for some relatively open sets U1, U2 in D. Let ˜β :
[0, 1] → ˜U be a path with ˜β(0) ∈ U1 and ˜β(1) ∈ U2. Reﬂecting parts of ˜β by
appropriate elements of G gives rise to a path β : [0, 1] → D with β(0) ∈ U1 and
β(1) ∈ U2. Therefore U1 and U2 are not disjoint and so U := D ∩ ˜U is connected.
The same argument shows V := D ∩ ˜V is connected, hence D has exactly two nodal
domains, U and V .

Suppose for the sake of a contradiction that ∂U ∩ Πi = ∅ for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
By Lemma 2, RΠi( ˜U ) is a nodal domain. Since u takes diﬀerent signs on ˜U and
˜V , Lemma 1 implies that ˜U = RΠi ( ˜U ). Let p ∈ ˜U . Then there exists a continuous
curve β : [0, 1] → ˜U with β(0) = p and β(1) = RΠi(p).

Let H be the index two subgroup of G naturally identiﬁed with the quotient
G/RΠi. In particular, D ∪ RΠi (D) is a fundamental domain for H. After possibly
reﬂecting parts of β by elements of H, we may suppose that β(t) ∈ U ∪ RΠi (U ) for

7

all t ∈ [0, 1]. But Πi disconnects U ∪ RΠi(U ), which implies there is a t0 ∈ (0, 1)
such that γ(t0) ∈ Σ ∩ Πi ⊂ V . This a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4. Suppose Σ2 ⊂ B3 is a G-invariant free boundary minimal surface
satisfying (C1) and (C2). Suppose D is simply connected and ∂D consists of at
most 5 edges. Then σ1(Σ) = 1.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that Σ is as above and σ1(Σ) < 1. Then ∂D
decomposes into a curve γ along ∂B3 and a sequence of no more than four edges
ej, each of which is contained in one of the planes Πi. As in the proof of Theorem 1,
D contains a nodal line ℓ which intersects an interior point of γ. Since D is simply
connected, ℓ divides D. We next claim that N = ℓ. If not, N contains a second
nodal line ℓ′ and either
(i). ℓ′ is a closed curve in D.
(ii). ℓ′ intersects ∂D twice and is disjoint from ℓ.
(iii). ℓ′ intersects ℓ.
Since D is simply connected, each of the above cases implies D has at least three
nodal domains, which contradicts Lemma 3. Therefore, ℓ = N , and so ℓ divides D
into exactly two nodal domains U and V .

Since ∂D consists of at most four edges other than γ, either U or V is bounded
by edges intersecting at most two of the three planes Πi. This contradicts Lemma
3.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2. The surfaces Σn and ˜Σn described by Folha, Pacard and Zolotareva
in [13] have ﬁrst Steklov eigenvalue equal to 1.

Proof. Let {e1, e2, e3} be the standard orthonormal frame for R3. Deﬁne

v1 = − sin(cid:16) π

n(cid:17) e1 + cos(cid:16) π

n(cid:17) e2,

v2 = e2,

v3 = e3

and Gn = hRΠv1 , RΠv2 , RΠv3 i. The surfaces in [13] are invariant under a group of
isometries Sn ⊂ O(3) (c.f. the discussion above Theorem 1.1 in [13]), and it is
straightforward to see that Sn = Gn.

In particular, the fundamental domain D := W ∩ Sn is simply connected and
consists of four edges γ, e1, e2, e3 with γ ∈ ∂B3 and ei ∈ Πvi , i = 1, 2, 3. The
fundamental domain D′
n := W ∩ Σn is a small normal perturbation of Dn and
n consists of four edges γ ′, e′
consequently ∂D′
i ∈ Πvi, i =
1, 2, 3. Thus, Theorem 4 implies σ1(Σn) = 1.

An analogous argument applies to the surfaces ˜Σn, except that the approximately
n := ˜Σn∩W
i ∈ Πvi , i = 1, 2, 3 and e4 ∈ Πv3 . In
(cid:3)

catenoidal neck centered at the origin means the fundamental domain ˜D′
consists of ﬁve edges γ, e′
any case, we may again appeal to Theorem 4 to conclude that σ1( ˜Σn) = 1.

i, i = 1, . . . , 4 with e′

Corollary 2 gives more evidence to the statement in [13] that Σn are likely con-
gruent to a family of surfaces Mn with σ1(Mn) = 1 previously constructed by Fraser
and Schoen (Theorem 5.16, [6]).
