Brain research has been driven by inquiry for principles of brain structure organization and its
control mechanisms. The neuronal wiring map of C. elegans, the only complete connectome available
till date, presents an incredible opportunity to learn basic governing principles that drive structure
and function of its neuronal architecture. Despite its apparently simple nervous system, C. elegans
is known to possess complex functions. The neuronal architecture forms an important underlying
framework which speciﬁes phenotypic features associated to sensation, movement, conditioning and
memory. In this study, with the help of graph theoretical models, we investigated the C. elegans
neuronal network to identify network features that are critical for its control. The ‘driver neurons’
are associated with important biological functions such as reproduction, signalling processes and
anatomical structural development. We created 1D and 2D network models of C. elegans neuronal
system to probe the role of features that confer controllability and small world nature. The simple
1D ring model is critically poised for the number of feed forward motifs, neuronal clustering and
characteristic path-length in response to synaptic rewiring, indicating optimal rewiring. Using
empirically observed distance constraint in the neuronal network as a guiding principle, we created
a distance constrained synaptic plasticity model that simultaneously explains small world nature,
saturation of feed forward motifs as well as observed number of driver neurons. Our model suggests
optimum long distance synaptic connections as a key feature specifying control of the network.

Keywords: C. elegans, neuronal network, feed forward motifs, synaptic plasticity, brain model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quest for understanding broad structural orga-
nization, functional building blocks and mechanisms of
control of nervous systems has been central to neu-
roscience [1]. Vast knowledge of cellular and molec-
ular mechanisms garnered through reductionist studies
over decades, while enriching our understanding of brain
mechanisms, have highlighted the need for holistic per-
spective of neural architecture [2]. This urge to delve
into systems properties has propelled eﬀorts into con-
nectome projects that attempt to map neural wirings to
the ﬁnest detail possible [3–6]. C. elegans connectome is
the only complete neuronal wiring diagram available till
date [3, 7, 8]. Along with the rich understanding avail-
able on the biology of this model organism [9, 10], its
connectome presents an incredible opportunity to learn
basic governing principles that drive structure and func-
tion of neuronal architecture.

Despite its apparently simple nervous system, C. ele-
gans is known to possess complex functions associated to
sensation, movement, conditioning and memory [11, 12].
This multi-cellular nematode has been extensively inves-
tigated to understand neural mechanisms involved in re-
sponse to chemicals, temperature, mechanical stimula-
tion as well as mating and egg laying behaviors [11, 13].
These biological functions have neuronal basis and are
a reﬂection of emergent properties of signal dynamics
over the network. Its nervous system has evolved to con-
fer evolutionary beneﬁts under constant tinkering and is

known to undergo synaptic rewiring during the course of
its life [14]. Beyond the broad evolutionary architecture,
synaptic plasticity oﬀers additional adaptive advantage
to respond to the environment and perhaps to achieve
better functional eﬃciency.

The C. elegans neuronal system could be modelled as a
network and studied for structural properties of its neu-
ronal architecture as well as for network dynamics (Fig-
ure 1). The C. elegans neuronal network (CeNN) has
been mapped to a high resolution with details of its
neurons, their locations and synaptic connectivity [15].
The network, comprising of 277 neurons that are inter-
linked with 2105 synapses, has been studied for its broad
structural features as well as towards identiﬁcation of
motifs that potentially contribute to the dynamics over
the network. Using graph theoretical measures, CeNN
has been observed to have a small world architecture
with small path length and high clustering [16]. This
has been proposed to be due to processes that leave the
network critically poised between absolute order and ex-
treme randomness. The small world nature may render
this neural network (as well as other neuronal systems)
eﬃcient for information dynamics. When probing for net-
work sub-structures that could form the building block
of the CeNN, Milo et al. identiﬁed feed forward motifs
(FFMs) to be signiﬁcantly over-represented [17]. Such
structural building blocks have been suggested to be of
functional relevance to biological systems (in addition to
other networked systems). How exactly such building
blocks may oﬀer functional advantage to networked sys-
tems and whether these entities have evolved to optimize
the building blocks is not clearly understood yet.

show such a network is critically poised for the number
of FFMs, neuronal clustering and characteristic path-
length in response to synaptic rewiring, indicating op-
timal rewiring. We found that synaptic connections be-
tween neurons are characterized with a strong distance
constraint in CeNN. Using this as a guiding principle, we
created a distance constrained synaptic plasticity model
that simultaneously explains small world nature, FFM
saturation and controllability of the network. This model
accounted for the observed number of driver neurons
and also accurately identiﬁed speciﬁc driver neurons.
Thus our model presents realistic process of distance con-
strained synaptic plasticity as a plausible basis of nature
of functional sub-structures and controllability observed
in CeNN.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. C. elegans neuronal network

The nervous system of C. elegans consists of 277 neu-
rons (barring the pharyngeal neurons) which are inter-
connected via electrical and chemical synapses [3, 15].
We constructed CeNN, a graph theoretic model of C. el-
egans neuronal network, comprising of 277 somatic neu-
rons and 2105 synaptic connections. Multiple synaptic
connections between two neurons were merged to yield a
simple directed unweighted graph in which neurons rep-
resent nodes and synaptic connections are links. A typ-
ical neuron in CeNN on an average had 7.59 synaptic
connections.

B. Topological properties of CeNN

We calculated following graph theoretical properties of
the network embodying clustering, compactness, struc-
tural motifs and controllability of the network.

1. Clustering coeﬃcient

Clustering coeﬃcient of a node Ci is deﬁned as ratio of
number of triangles (triangle refers to a three node clique)
made by a node with its neighbours to the maximum
number of triangles that can be formed by them [16].
For a graph G = (V, E) the clustering coeﬃcient of a
node i is deﬁned as follows:

Ci =

| {ejk : vj, vk ∈ Ni, ejk ∈ E} |

ki(ki − 1)

Here, Ni refers to the neighbourhood of node i and ki

represents its connectivity (degree).

(cid:80)n

The average clustering coeﬃcient (C) was calcu-
lated by averaging clustering coeﬃcients of all n nodes:
C = 1
n

i=1 Ci.

FIG. 1. Network structure of C. elegans nervous system.
Functionally relevant driver neurons (34 nodes highlighted in
white) were identiﬁed with maximum matching criterion. Be-
yond explaining the small world nature, saturation of feed
forward motifs and observed number driver neurons, our dis-
tance constrained synaptic plasticity model accurately iden-
tiﬁes speciﬁc driver neurons.

Control systems approach to complex networks pro-
vides a better perspective of dynamics over the network
and ability to steer its ‘state’ [18]. Neuronal architec-
ture of CeNN forms an important underlying framework
which speciﬁes phenotypic features of C. elegans.
Im-
portant behavioural traits as well as cognitive processes
(such as movement, sensation, egg laying, mechanocep-
tion, chemosensation and memory) are known to have
neuronal basis. A network is said to be controllable if it
can be reached to a desired state from any initial state
by providing inputs to certain nodes [18, 19]. The set
of nodes that facilitate such a control are named driver
nodes [18].

By studying genotypic and phenotypic aspects of
CeNN, in our earlier study we have shown that ‘driver
neurons’ are associated with important biological func-
tions such as reproduction, signalling processes and
anatomical structural development [20].
Interestingly,
randomized controls have no driver neurons as compared
to CeNN which presents a sizeable number of driver neu-
rons that are crucial for its control. While earlier studies
have shown connectivity of neurons in CeNN partially
explains the observed number of driver neurons [18], no
model has so far been developed that accounts for its
small world architecture, over-representation of FFMs as
well as controllability.

In this study, we create one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) network models of C. elegans neu-
ronal system to investigate the role of FFMs as build-
ing blocks in conferring controllability and small world
nature. With the help of a simple 1D ring model we

CeNN but the connectivity was random. In DD control
the in-degree and out-degree of each node was also pre-
served in addition to number of nodes and edges.

D. 1D ring model of CeNN

We constructed a ring graph model of CeNN so as
to maximise the number of FFMs while preserving the
number of neurons (n) as well as average neuronal con-
nectivity (k) of CeNN (Figure 2). Starting with n(= 277)
nodes arranged in a circular manner, every node was con-
nected (in anti-clockwise sense) to its next nearest neigh-
bour with a directed edge. The procedure was repeated
to connect every node with its nearest neighbour and
the next nearest neighbour until the out-degree of every
node matched with that of average out-degree of CeNN
(k = 7.59 ≈ 8). This strategy maximises the number
of FFMs to nk(k − 1)/2 in the regular graph model of
CeNN and represents an asymptotic version saturated
with FFMs.

2. Characteristic path-length

Characteristic path-length (L) enumerates compact-
ness, reﬂecting ease of information transfer, of the net-
work. It is deﬁned as the average of shortest path-lengths
among all pairs of nodes in the network.

3. Feed forward motifs

Network motifs are deﬁned as patterns of interconnec-
tions occurring in complex networks at numbers that
are signiﬁcantly higher than those in randomized net-
works [17]. In a three node digraph 13 diﬀerent types of
three node motifs can exist. Angular motifs are linear
three node sub-structures, and triangular motifs com-
prise of three nodes inter-connected with either unidi-
rectional or bidirectional edges. For our studies, we com-
puted number of feed forward motifs, nF F M , (among uni-
directional triangular motifs) that are prevalent in many
real world networks including CeNN [17, 21]. Please see
Section S1 (Figure S1 and Figure S2) of Supplemental
Material for more details. We used the algorithm em-
ployed by Milo et al. for identiﬁcation and enumeration
of frequency of occurrence motifs [17]. The Zscore, indi-
cating signiﬁcance of observed number of FFMs in CeNN,
was calculated by comparing it with random controls:
Zscore = nF F M (CeN N )−nF F M (ER)

.

4. Number of driver neurons

From control systems perspective, driver nodes in a
network are those nodes which when controlled by ex-
ternal input can provide full control over the state of
the network [18]. Analogously, we term driver nodes in
CeNN as driver neurons. Due to their role in control
of network, driver neurons are of functional relevance to
the neuronal network. We computed minimum number
of driver neurons (nD) using maximum matching crite-
rion [18]. A node is said to be matching if any matching
edge is pointing towards it and is unmatched if no match-
ing edge is directed towards it. We implemented maxi-
mum matching algorithm proposed by Pothen et al. to
ﬁnd unique unmatched nodes by augment matching [22].

C. Random controls of CeNN

We constructed two random controls of CeNN viz.
Erd¨os-R´enyi random control (ER) and degree distribu-
tion conserved control (DD) [23, 24]. In ER control num-
ber of nodes and edges were kept the same as that of

FIG. 2. The 1D ring model, with neurons linked for max-
imizing number of feed forward motifs, was rewired with in-
creasing probability of synaptic rewiring. Starting with an
asymptotic model (with 277 nodes and 8 out-going edges)
saturated with FFMs, synaptic rewiring was emulated with
probability p. The model exhibits a spectrum of topological
variations between extreme regularity and randomness. The
ﬁgure shows an illustration for 10 nodes and 2 outgoing edges.
See Figure S3 of Supplemental Material for another illustra-
tion.

To mimic random synaptic plasticity in this simple 1D
model, we rewired every edge in this network with a cer-
tain ‘probability of rewiring (p)’. Every out-going edge
connecting a node to its nearest neighbour was chosen
and rewired randomly with probability p by ensuring that
there were no duplicate edges or self-edges and that the
network is always connected. In the second lap, the pro-
cess was repeated for the edges made with next-nearest
neighbours and so on. All edges are thus exhaustively
considered for rewiring in k laps. For every probability
of rewiring 1000 instances of graphs were created for a
range of p = 10−4 to p = 1. Topological properties (C,
L, nF F M and nD) were computed for every instance of
graph thus generated.

E. Distance constrained models of CeNN

G.

Identiﬁcation of speciﬁc driver neurons

4

We created 2D distance constrained models that, anal-
ogous to distance constraint observed in CeNN, follow a
restraint on synaptic connectivity based on distance be-
tween two neurons. These 2D models are based on posi-
tional data of C. elegans neurons, that have been mapped
to a high resolution [15]. The probability P (d) that two
neurons at a distance d are connected with a synapse ap-
proximately follows a power law pattern observed from
empirical data:

P ∝ d−α

The distance constraint is modulated by the exponent
0 ≤ α ≤ ∞. Here, the distance between neurons i
and j, d(i, j), was calculated as the Euclidean distance:

d(i, j) =(cid:112)(xi − xj)2 + (yi − yj)2.

We created two models of CeNN based on the dis-
tance constraint: Distance constrained random (DCR)
and Distance constrained synaptic plasticity (DCP).

1. Distance constrained random (DCR) model

The underlying framework for DCR model is that of
ER control. Starting with ER (random) control, we
rewired every edge to impose distance constraint for spe-
ciﬁc exponent α. Statistics of topological parameters
were computed over 100 instances. Response of DCR
model was observed by varying the value of exponent
between 0 ≤ α ≤ 3.

2. Distance constrained synaptic plasticity (DCP) model

We obtained the set of speciﬁc driver neurons using
maximum matching algorithm [22]. The success of DCR,
DCP models in accurate identiﬁcation of driver neurons
was measured with the help of F1 score. Using the driver
neurons set identiﬁed from the CeNN (34) as the basis
(Details of driver neurons is provided in Table S7 of Sup-
plemental Material), we identiﬁed true positives (T P )
and true negatives (T N ) (neurons that are correctly clas-
siﬁed) as well as false positives (F P ) and false nega-
tives (F N ) (neurons that were incorrectly marked as
driver neurons, and neurons that were incorrectly marked
as non-driver neurons, respectively) for DCR and DCP
models across 100 instances. The F1 score, which is used
for computing the quality of binary classiﬁcation is de-
ﬁned as,F 1 =

2 T P

2 T P +F P +F N .

III. RESULTS

A. Topological properties of CeNN

Topological features of network provide insights into its
structure and function [25, 26]. Consistent with previous
reports, we observed that C. elegans neuronal network is
a small world network by virtue of high clustering coef-
ﬁcient (C = 0.172) and comparable characteristic path
length (L = 4.018), with respect to its randomized coun-
terpart (C ER = 0.028 and LER = 2.97) (Table I) [16].
Beyond these global topological features, CeNN is known
to be over represented with feed forward motifs [17] that
are functionally associated with mechanisms of mem-
ory [27]. We observed that, FFMs were signiﬁcantly over-
represented in CeNN (Zscore = 151.12) as compared to
those in corresponding random graphs.

In contrast to DCR model, the underlying framework
for DCP model is that of DD control which preserves
the synaptic connectivity of each neuron. Starting with
DD control, every edge was rewired to impose distance
constraint for speciﬁc exponent α and statistics of topo-
logical parameters were computed over 100 instances.

F. Cartesian graph model of CeNN

The deterministic Cartesian graph model of CeNN was
created by ensuring that every neuron is connected to its
spatially nearest neurons. Begining with (n =) 277 neu-
rons placed at cartesian coordinates matching their ob-
served position in the nervous system of C. elegans [15],
every neuron was connected to (k =) 8 spatially nearest
neurons. This model reﬂects preferential deterministic
connections made by a neuron based on its distance from
another neuron.

From control systems perspective CeNN can be con-
trolled through a small set of driver neurons (34) to any
desired state in ﬁnite time [18]. The number of driver
neurons in CeNN is signiﬁcantly higher in comparison
to its random counterpart. Driver neurons in CeNN are
genotypically and phenotypically associated with biolog-
ical functions such as reproduction and maintenance of
cellular processes [20]. This alludes to the fact that driver
neurons serve a critical role in the neuronal architecture
of C. elegans and the number of driver neurons therefore
has functional bearing on its control.

Table I depicts topological features of CeNN that are
potentially critical for specifying its function. Other

than the small world nature, evident from high clustering
among neurons, the CeNN is characterized with signiﬁ-
cantly higher number of driver nodes as well as number
of feed forward motifs. While connectivity (degree) of
neurons (DD) partially explains the increase in FFMs as
well as that in nD, at the same time it cannot account
for observed clustering. No comprehensive model that
can explain all of these functionally relevant features is
hitherto known.

B. 1D ring model of CeNN

To investigate for possible mechanisms that could have
lead to the observed saturation of FFMs, we created a 1D
ring model of CeNN. A directed regular ring graph with
n neurons and k average synapses can have a maximum
of nk(k − 1)/2 FFMs as shown in (Figure 2). Starting
from such a regular ring graph maximally saturated with
7756 FFMs, we simulated random synaptic rewiring to
observe its eﬀect on topological features. In addition to
FFM saturation, the regular graph had very high aver-
age clustering coeﬃcient (C reg = 0.35) as well as charac-
teristic path-length (Lreg = 17.69). From an analogous
undirected Watts and Strogatz model it was anticipated
that with increase in synaptic rewiring the clustering as
well as path-length would decrease to approach that of
random graph asymptotically [16]. This simulation of
synaptic rewiring was also expected to provide insights
into its impact on number of FFMs and driver neurons.
As shown in the Figure 3, with increasing probability of
synaptic rewiring the number of FFMs is unaﬀected up to
p ≈ 0.01 before falling sharply. While this result points
at a critical threshold for number of FFMs in response to
probability of synaptic rewiring, no driver neurons were
presented by the model across the simulation (nD ≈ 0 ∀
0 ≤ p ≤ 1). For 1D ring graph, these results highlight a
critical threshold of rewiring for which the network has
optimum saturation of FFMs. Such a simple model can
only provide topological insights devoid of biological ba-
sis. Search for a more realistic model prompted us to
look for biological constraints that may dictate synaptic
rewiring as well as to build a 2D model that could possi-
bly reveal mechanisms that render observed controllabil-
ity in CeNN.

FIG. 3.
Response of 1D ring model with changing prob-
ability of synaptic rewiring was measured in terms of aver-
age clustering coeﬃcient (C), characteristic path-length (L),
number of FFMs (nF F M ) and number of driver nodes (nD).
For intermediate values of p, the model exhibits small world
phenomenon as well as FFM saturation, but can not account
for controllability (nD = 0 ∀ p). All parameters were normal-
ized with respect to the initial ring graph (p = 0). Error bars
represent standard deviation over 100 instances. Please see
Section S3 of Supplemental Material (Figure S4, Figure S5
and Figure S6) for non-normalized data.

FIG. 4. Empirical distance constrained synaptic connectivity
pattern observed in C. elegans neuronal wiring. The number
of synapses that connect neurons at distance d approximately
follows a power law pattern with an exponent of α = 1.92
(R2 = 0.6).

C. CeNN follows distance constrained synaptic

connectivity pattern

We measured the connectivity pattern in CeNN by
enumerating number of neuron pairs that are synapti-
cally connected and cartesian distance between them. We
observed that the synaptic connections were constrained
by distance as evident from the nature of their data (Fig-
ure 4). The probability of two neurons being connected
approximately scales as a power law (P (d) ∝ d−α), with
presence of a few exceptional long distance connections.

To incorporate this empirical distance constrained con-
nectivity pattern we created more realistic 2D models:
(1) Distance constrained random (DCR) model that adds
distance constraint starting from ER control, and (2)
Distance constrained plasticity (DCP) model that over-
lays the distance constraint starting from the DD control.
Along with the ER and DD random controls these mod-
els allow us to segregate the contribution of degree (con-
nectivity) vis-`a-vis distance constrained synaptic wiring
towards conferring observed topological features upon
CeNN.

FIG. 5. Response of distance constrained models of CeNN (DCR and DCP) with increasing constraint (α) measured in terms
of (a) average clustering coeﬃcient (C), (b) characteristic path-length (L), (c) number of FFMs (nF F M ), and (d) number of
driver nodes (nD). The lower the α more heterogenous are the synaptic lengths (larger proportion of long range synapses). For
α = 0, DCR and DCP models converge to ER and DD controls, respectively. For asymptotic limits of α → ∞ both the models
converge to the Cartesian model, a regular model with saturation of FFMs coupled with high clustering but devoid of driver
nodes. While the small world nature (reﬂected in high clustering and low path-length) and FFM saturation is realized by both
DCR and DCP models, DCP model stands out in reproducing all key features of CeNN for 0.6 ≤ α ≤ 1.8 (highlighted with
gray background). Please see Figure S7, Table S1 and Table S2 of Supplemental Material for details about nature of degree
distributions and associated data.

D. Distance constrained random model

The distance constrained random (DCR) model is a
2D model in which the number of neurons, number of
synapses and neuronal locations were preserved. Start-
ing from initial random connectivity (ER) every synapse
was probabilistically rewired to follow distance constraint
with a certain α (Figure 5). The lower asymptotic limit
of this model converges to ER model for α = 0. With
increasing α the probability of long distance synaptic
connections decreases. For extremely large values of α
this model converges to the Cartesian model in which ev-
ery neuron is deterministically connected to its spatially
nearest neighbours. We varied the value of α between
0 and 3 to assess its impact on the topology of neural
network. We found that the average clustering coeﬃ-
cient, characteristic path-length and number of FFMs
monotonously increase with increasing α. For these pa-
rameters the DCR model was closest to actual neuronal
network of C. elegans for α = 0.6. While this model
took us closer to CeNN, it did not reﬂect controllabil-
ity measured in terms of nD. The driver neurons vanish

for asymptotic limits of α with maximum nD = 15.7 for
α = 0.4. The fact that DD control, in which number
of synapses of every neuron is preserved, matches with
CeNN better in controllability (Table I) prompted us to
create a more reﬁned ‘distance constrained synaptic plas-
ticity model’.

E. Distance constrained synaptic plasticity model

The distance constrained synaptic plasticity (DCP)
model preserves the number of synapses of every neuron
over and above the number of neurons and their loca-
tions. While following the distance constraint, this model
mimics synaptic rewiring that is known to take place
in CeNN [14, 28]. We observed the response of topo-
logical features for varying extent of distance constraint
(0 ≤ α ≤ 3) (Figure 5).
In addition to the clustering
and characteristic path-length, interestingly, this model
successfully realised number of FFMs as well as number
of driver neurons. We found that for an intermediate dis-
tance constraint of α = 0.6 this model is closest to CeNN

7

was signiﬁcantly better compared to DCR model (the ac-
curacy of which was indistinguishable from that obtained
from random sampling) and superior to DD control in the
presence of dominant long distance connections (α ≤ 1).
Thus DCP model is not only closer to real-world network
in terms of number of driver nodes but also accurately
identiﬁed speciﬁc neurons that can drive the network
dynamics.
In summary, the DCP model, that embeds
empirically observed phenomenon of neuronal rewiring
in addition to ﬁxed neuronal connectivity, successfully
recreates topological features of functional relevance to
C. elegans.

IV. DISCUSSION

C. elegans connectome is one of the simplest yet com-
plete neural diagram known to us so far. The neuronal
network of this organism is responsible for many essential
cognitive functions including learning and memory [12].
CeNN seemingly has evolved as a small world network
with high clustering and low characteristic path-length
for functional beneﬁts [16]. Other than the small world
global architecture CeNN is reported to be enriched with
number of feed forward motifs among all possible three
and four node motifs [17]. Our results suggest that the
heterogeneous composition of motifs dictated by FFMs
contributes to increased clustering as well as control of
the network.

Analysis of neuronal architecture of CeNN has revealed
that the network is optimally wired [7, 29] and is dictated
by constraints [8, 30]. Till date a few simple null models
of CeNN have been implemented with network feature
constraints [23, 24]. These studies suggest that neuronal
connectivity plays a key role in rendering clustering as
well as presentation of as many driver neurons as ob-
served in CeNN [18, 24]. None of these models has been
able to explain all network features, especially clustering
and number of driver neurons, claimed to be of biological
relevance [18, 20].

Here, for the ﬁrst time, we present a distance con-
strained synaptic plasticity model that accounts for high
clustering, FFMs saturation and large number of driver
nodes. With a 1D ring model maximized for feed forward
motifs, we show that such a model exhibits critical phe-
nomenon in response to increased probability of synap-
tic rewiring. While this simple model lends interesting
insights into the mechanisms of CeNN architecture, it
cannot capture the aspect of controllability. Rooted in
empirical observation of distance constraint followed in
neuronal connections, we built more realistic 2D distance
constrained models with random connectivity (DCR) and
degree preserved connectivity (DCP). The latter model,
that mimics real-world C. elegans neuronal wiring and
follows a distance constrained synaptic plasticity mech-
anism, comes closest to the CeNN in presenting small
world architecture, dominance of FFMs and nature of
controllability within a narrow range of free variable α.

FIG. 6.
Accuracy of identiﬁcation of speciﬁc driver neu-
rons with changing distance constraint exponent. The DCR
model, with random synaptic connectivity pattern,
fared
poorly. The performance of DCP model was consistently bet-
ter than that of the DCR model indicating the critical role
played by the distance constraint in specifying the control
of the neuronal network. For optimum distance constraint
(α = 0.4) DCP model provides the best match with the real-
ity (F 1 score = 0.77), better than what could be accounted
for by only neuronal connectivity (DD control; indicated with
a dashed line). The spectrum of distance constraint regime
for which DCP model is closet to CeNN (0.6 ≤ α ≤ 1.8) is
highlighted with gray background.

in reproducing number of driver neurons that are criti-
cal for control of the network (Figure 5(d)). This model
presents a narrow range of distance constraint parameter
(0.6 ≤ α ≤ 1.8) for which the small world nature as well
as functionally relevant features of regulatory motifs and
controllability were realistically exhibited. The number
of driver nodes in DCP model was always higher than
those returned by DCR model. For α < 1.8, i.e. in the
presence of strong distance constraint, DCP model re-
turned signiﬁcantly high number of driver nodes higher
than maximally displayed by DCR model. This points
at the role of long distance synaptic connections in con-
ferring observed nature of control in CeNN.

F.

Identiﬁcation of speciﬁc driver neurons

While the DCP model successfully reproduces key
topological features important for function and control
of CeNN (Figure 5), the question is whether it can also
capture speciﬁc neurons implicated in control of the net-
work and not just the number of driver neurons (Fig-
ure 5(d)). We compared speciﬁc neurons identiﬁed by
the minimum driver neurons set obtained from real-world
CeNN with that obtained from distance constraint mod-
els, for varying extent of distance constraint (Figure 6).
Neurons that were consistently identiﬁed as driver neu-
rons over 100 random instances of DCP and DCR models
were distilled (True Positives). The classiﬁcation accu-
racy of these models was assessed using F1 score. Inter-
estingly, we found that the performance of DCP model

The DCP model also successfully captures speciﬁc driver
neurons with impressive accuracy. Our results suggest

that the extent of synaptic plasticity in CeNN is opti-
mized so as to acquire key structural and dynamical net-
work features.

S1. THREE NODE MOTIF CLASSIFICATION

9

Motifs are patterns of local connectivity among nodes that are present in numbers signiﬁcantly higher than expected
by chance. The pattern of connectivity among 13 three node connected digraphs could be divided into angular motifs
and triangular motifs (Figure S1). Angular motifs are linear three node sub-structures, whereas triangular motifs
comprise of three nodes subgraphs with either unidirectional or bidirectional edges. For our studies, we computed
number of feed forward motifs, nF F M , (among unidirectional triangular motifs) that are prevalent in many real world
networks including CeNN. In CeNN, feed forward motifs are most prevalent among all unidirectional motifs as shown
in Figure S2.

FIG. S1. Classiﬁcation of three node subgraphs

FIG. S2. Statistics for unidirectional three node motifs depicting over-representation of feed forward motifs. The Z-Score was
computed in comparison to 100 instances of random controls (ER) of CeNN.

S2. 1D RING MODEL OF CENN

10

Following is an illustration of 1D ring model with 20 nodes and 4 outgoing synapses for every node(n = 20 and

k = 4) (Figure S3).

FIG. S3. Regular graph for maximum number of Feed forward motifs with graph growth. Edges are directed and point from
nodes to nearest neighbours along with neighbour of neighbours and so on. This representation if for n = 20 and k = 4.

S3. RESPONSE OF CENN 1D RING MODEL TO REWIRING

Starting from a 1-D regular ring graph maximally saturated with 7756 FFMs, we simulated random synaptic
rewiring to observe its eﬀect on topological features. In addition FFMs saturation, the regular graph had very high
average clustering coeﬃcient (C reg = 0.35) as well as characteristic path-length (Lreg = 17.69). Figure (S4, S5 and
S6) shows with increasing probability of synaptic rewiring the number of FFMs is unaﬀected up to p ≈ 0.01 before
falling sharply. These are true value ﬁgures from whcih one can estimate the change in number of each parameter
with changing value of p.
