We demonstrate the suppression of photon shot noise dephasing in a superconducting qubit by
eliminating its dispersive coupling to the readout cavity. This is achieved in a tunable coupling qubit,
where the qubit frequency and coupling rate can be controlled independently. We observe that the
coherence time approaches twice the relaxation time and becomes less sensitive to thermal photon
noise when the dispersive coupling rate is tuned from several MHz to 22 kHz. This work provides a
promising building block in circuit quantum electrodynamics that can hold high coherence and be
integrated into larger systems.

INTRODUCTION

Superconducting quantum circuits are a strong can-
didate for quantum computing [1–3] and a convenient
platform for quantum optics [4–6] and quantum simu-
lation [7, 8]. Extensive eﬀorts have been made in the
last decade to isolate these quantum systems from vari-
ous decay channels and noise sources in the environment,
leading to an increase of several orders of magnitude in
energy relaxation time T1 and phase coherence time T2
(ref. 9). State-of-the-art devices have achieved T1 and
T2 in the millisecond regime [10, 11] and pushed gate ﬁ-
delity close to the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum
computing [12]. However, the progress in T2 is slower
than that in T1 and T2/T1 ratios in these devices fall in
the range between 0.5 and 1.5 (refs. 10, 13, and 14). De-
viation from the theoretical limit of T2 = 2T1 indicates
dephasing mechanisms that need to be understood and
circumvented.

In circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) [15, 16],
manipulation and readout of a superconducting qubit are
mediated by its coupling to a transmission line cavity.
When the coupling is dispersive, the cavity causes a pho-
ton number dependent frequency shift of the qubit, char-
acterized by the dispersive coupling rate χ. As a result,
thermal or quantum ﬂuctuations in photon number will
induce dephasing of the qubit. This photon shot noise
dephasing mechanism has been studied theoretically [17]
and experimentally [14] and has become a dominant fac-
tor that limits the coherence time of superconducting
qubits. To further improve T2, high Q (> 106) 3D cavities
have been used to suppress the ﬂuctuation of cavity pho-
tons [10, 18] and careful ﬁltering and thermal anchoring
is needed to reduce thermal photon population [14, 19].
Instead of taming the ﬂuctuations of cavity photons,
we adopt a diﬀerent strategy to suppress photon shot
noise dephasing by eliminating the dispersive coupling
between the qubit and the readout cavity, i.e., by tuning
χ to near zero. This is realized in a tunable coupling
qubit (TCQ) [20, 21], where the qubit frequency and
coupling strength can be tuned independently [22]. We
start with spectroscopic measurements on the TCQ to

demonstrate the independent tunability of its frequency
and dispersive coupling rate. We achieve χ as low as
22 kHz when the dispersive interaction of two diﬀerent
qubit modes is tuned to cancel each other. Next we show
that readout of the qubit state near the zero-χ regime
can be realized by utilizing a higher energy level. Fi-
nally, we perform time domain measurements of T1 and
T2 with injected noise and demonstrate the robustness of
T2 against photon shot noise when χ is near zero.

RESULTS

The TCQ, shown in Fig. 1a, consists of two transmon
qubits [23] strongly coupled to each other via a common
third island. The geometry of the islands are designed
to minimize the electric participation ratios in the mate-
rial interfaces and reduce bulk and surface losses of the
qubit [24]. The two transmons are formed by capaci-
tively shunted SQUID loops and their frequencies can
be tuned by two DC voltages applied to the local mag-
netic ﬂux bias lines. The strong coupling between the
transmon states causes their hybridization and results in
a V-shaped energy diagram shown in Fig. 1b. The one-
excitation manifold contains two collective qubit states
whose frequencies ω± and dipole coupling rates g± can
be tuned as a function of the two ﬂux biases. Tun-
able coupling originates from the interference between
the dipole moments of the two transmons and provides
an extra degree of freedom compared to standard trans-
mon qubits. The two-excitation states acquire diﬀerent
self and cross anharmonicities α± and αc due to the hy-
bridization, which allows us to drive a desired transi-
tion between two states (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1b)
without causing other unwanted transitions. A copla-
nar waveguide (CPW) cavity with resonance frequency
ωr/2π = 7.14 GHz and linewidth κ/2π = 250 kHz is ca-
pacitively coupled to the TCQ to drive and read out the
qubit states.

We operate the TCQ in the dispersive regime, where
the qubit-cavity detunings |∆±| = |ω± − ωr| (cid:29) |g±|, and

Here a, b± denote the annihilation operators for the cav-

pling rates between the qubits and the cavity. The mea-
sured values for the parameters are ω−/2π = 7.25 GHz,
0 <∼ g−/2π < 10 MHz, ω+/2π ≈ 9.80 GHz, g+/2π ≈ 90
MHz, α−/2π = 129 MHz, α+/2π = 239 MHz, and
αc/2π = 358 MHz.
In this work, we use the ground
(|0−0+(cid:105)) and ﬁrst excited (|1−0+(cid:105)) states as the compu-
tational basis, so the logical qubit has frequency ω− and
dispersive coupling rate χ−. The tunability of χ− can be
seen from its explicit expression derived in ref. 20 using
second order perturbation theory,

where χ1,2 correspond to contributions from the two col-
lective qubit states. The ability to vary g± in addition to
∆± allows us to tune χ− in a ﬂexible way. In particular,
when we tune one qubit into the straddling regime [23, 25]
and the other far above the cavity, i.e., g− (cid:28) ∆− < α−
and ∆+ (cid:29) max(αc, g+), χ1 and χ2 have opposite signs
and χ− reaches zero when they cancel each other. In the
experiment, we ﬁx ∆− and use g− as the main control
knob to tune χ−: When g− is large enough, χ1 > |χ2|

and χ− is positive; As we tune down g−, χ1 decreases
and χ− becomes negative when χ1 < |χ2|.

Figure 2 shows the measured data for tuable χ−. Stan-
dard qubit spectroscopy measurement is repeated for dif-
ferent combinations of the two ﬂux biases (Φ1, Φ2) to map
out the constant ω− contour in Fig. 2a. Here, Φ1 is varied
linearly and Φ2 (not shown in the ﬁgure) is determined
by the condition that ω−/2π remains 7.25 GHz when the
intracavity photon number ¯n is small. Along the contour,
the phase shift of the cavity transmission changes sign,
indicating that χ− crosses zero. For larger ¯n, the qubit
frequency is dressed by cavity photons and exhibits an
ac Stark shift [26] of ¯nχ−. The dressed qubit frequency
in Fig. 2b shows clearly that χ− can be tuned to be both
positive and negative, from a few MHz down to below
the cavity linewidth κ/2π = 250 kHz, which cannot be
resolved in the qubit spectroscopy.

As χ− approaches zero, so does the readout contrast
because there is no dispersive shift caused by the |1−0+(cid:105)
state, as is illustrated in Fig. 2 near Φ1 = −0.95. To
achieve eﬃcient readout for small χ−, we adopt a scheme
that utilizes a third state |1−1+(cid:105).
In this scheme, we
apply a transfer pulse at frequency ω+ − αc to the
TCQ, inducing a |1−0+(cid:105) → |1−1+(cid:105) transition, imme-
diately before the readout pulse at frequency ωr. The
|1−1+(cid:105) state provides a measured dispersive shift of
−1.2 MHz around the zero χ− point and can be used
to indirectly read out the logical qubit state. To test
this readout method, we prepare the logical qubit to
a state |ψ(cid:105) characterized by Rabi angle θ1, i.e., |ψ(cid:105) =
cos(θ1/2)|0−0+(cid:105) + sin(θ1/2)|1−0+(cid:105), by sending a Gaus-
sian pulse at frequency ω−. A transfer pulse with Rabi
angle θ2 is then applied as described above, followed by

the readout pulse. The widths of the Gaussian pulses are
ﬁxed at σ = 16 ns and θ1,2 are controlled by the pulse
amplitudes. Figure 3a shows the measured homodyne
signal at χ− ≈ 0 as a function of θ1 and θ2. Rabi oscil-
lations for both |0−0+(cid:105) ↔ |1−0+(cid:105) and |1−0+(cid:105) ↔ |1−1+(cid:105)
transitions are observed, demonstrating coherent trans-
fers between the quantum states. In the absence of the
transfer pulse, no visible contrast is observed because of
small χ− (blue dots in Fig. 3b). As the amplitude of the
transfer pulse is adjusted to θ2 = π, |ψ(cid:105) is transferred
to |ψ(cid:48)(cid:105) = cos(θ1/2)|0−0+(cid:105) + sin(θ1/2)|1−1+(cid:105), which gives
the maximum readout contrast (red crosses in Fig. 3b)
and recovers the Rabi angle θ1. This method allows for
the single qubit control and readout scheme to be per-
formed entirely with microwave pulses, and does not in-
volve dynamical tuning of χ− via fast ﬂux biasing, which
might cause unexpected transient processes that reduce
the qubit coherence. It also allows low pass ﬁltering in
the ﬂux bias lines to reduce magnetic ﬂux noise in the
SQUID loops.

Combining the tunability of χ− and the readout
method, we perform time domain measurements for the
qubit relaxation and coherence time. In addition to the
standard measurement setup, we use a noise source to

mined by the amplitudes of the two drive pulses. (b) Hori-

study the inﬂuence of thermal photon ﬂuctuations on
qubit dephasing. White noise within the bandwidth
7.1375 GHz ± 5 MHz is injected to the device, cover-
ing the cavity but not the qubit, and its power density
determines the intracavity noise photon number nth. In
Fig. 4a, the measured T1 and T2 for χ−/2π = 1.9 MHz are
plotted as a function of the injected noise power. A Hahn
echo pulse is used in measuring T2 to eliminate slow de-
phasing processes caused by ﬂux noise, etc. While T1 ex-
hibits little dependence on the injected noise and remains
8 ∼ 11 µs, T2 drops from 16 µs to 3.5 µs as the noise
power increases, reﬂecting a photon shot noise limited
T2 when χ− is comparable to χ used in normal transmon
devices. Figure 4b shows the result for the same mea-

and T2 = 20 ∼ 22 µs, and no reduction is observed in
either T1 or T2 up to nth = 0.13. To quantitatively ana-
lyze the result, we use the analytic expression for photon

and ﬁt the measured T2 data to equation (3), shown in
the red curves in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, a single linear ﬁtting
parameter converts the output power of the noise source
to the nth values in the x axis; In Fig. 4b we extract
χ−/2π = 22 kHz from the best ﬁt to equation (3).

DISCUSSION

To estimate Γφ, we assume a typical nth = 0.02
(refs. 14 and 26). The small χ− leads to Γφ = 0.25
kHz, corresponding to a photon shot noise limited T2 of
4000 µs. In comparison, to achieve the same level of Γφ
with the same nth in a high Q cavity device would re-
quire κ/2π = 2 kHz (Q ∼ 3× 106). The smallest χ− that
can be achieved is limited by the ﬂux noise in the SQUID
loops, which can be reduced by using smaller loops and
heavy ﬁltering in the ﬂux bias lines. The T1 of the de-
vice is Purcell limited [27] because of the small detuning
between the qubit and cavity, evidenced by a measured
T1 = 21 µs when tuning the qubit to 2.2 GHz below the
cavity, and can be improved by increasing cavity Q or
engineering the cavity spectrum using ﬁlters [28, 29].

Compared to other methods to suppress photon shot
noise dephasing, our approach does not rely on very high
Q cavities and T2 is limited by χ−, which in principle

can be tuned to zero. Gate operation and readout can
be performed conveniently without dynamical control of
the qubit. The planar geometry also makes it easy to in-
tegrate the device into larger cQED systems. The ability
to access and measure the quantum state while main-
taing the high coherence makes the TCQ a promising
building block for the processing and storage of quantum
information.

METHODS

The device is fabricated on a 500-µm-thick sapphire
substrate. The CPW cavity is deﬁned using photolithog-
raphy and reactive ion etching of a 200 nm ﬁlm of nio-
bium sputtered on the sapphire. The TCQ is patterned
using electron beam lithography and the Josephson junc-
tions are made using bridge-free, double-angle evapo-
ration [30]. The chip is mounted and wire bonded to
a printed circuit board and cooled down to ∼ 10 mK
in a dilution refrigerator.
Input signals generated at
room temperature are attenuated and ﬁltered at diﬀerent
stages of the refrigerator. Output signals are ampliﬁed at
4 K and room temperature and acquired by a high-speed
digitizer.
