Introduction

1.
The development of hollow-core photonic crystal ﬁbre (HC-PCF) technology over the past
decade has opened up a vast array of possibilities for new applications. When ﬁlled with gas,
the HC-PCF is a good candidate for frequency stabilization and sensing in demanding envi-
ronments such as ﬁeld operations and space applications, since this provides a compact, low-
weight container for molecular gas while retaining large interaction length between laser light
coupled trough the ﬁbre and the molecules inside the hollow core. Speciﬁcally for satellite-
based LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) measurements, a lightweight laser source with

high stability and accuracy is desirable, since the accuracy of the LIDAR measurement depends
directly on these parameters.
Current state-of-the-art laser frequency stabilisation using gas-ﬁlled hollow-core ﬁbres have
demonstrated a relative long-term instability of about 4× 10−12 and relative short-term insta-
bility of about 2×10−12 for one second averaging time [1–3]. These results were obtained with
acetylene and iodine using saturated absorption spectroscopy, which gives linewidths of typi-
cally 20 MHz. The main limitations to the stability are decoherence due to collisions between
molecules and the inner wall of the HC-PCF as well as excitation of higher order optical modes
in the HC-PCF. Stabilization to Doppler broadened absorption lines has also been demonstrated
in the telecom wavelength range using acetylene [4] as well as in the 2 micron range using CO2
ﬁlled HC-PCF [5], but without the possibility of tuning the offset frequency.

Here, we report on a compact ﬁbre-based laser system at 2.05 microns stabilised to the CO2
P(30) transition at 2050.967 nm using frequency modulation spectroscopy [6] in a gas-ﬁlled
hollow-core ﬁbre. The laser system was developed as a part of a project for the European
Space Agency (ESA) aiming towards satellite-based LIDAR measurements. Several require-
ments on size, accuracy and stability of the system were therefore imposed; all of which
our system meets. The compact ﬁber-based optical setup ﬁts inside a box with dimensions
(25 × 25 × 5) cm3. The laser exhibits an absolute frequency accuracy of better than 5 MHz
√
or 3× 10−8, frequency stability of better than 105 Hz/
τ up to around 1000 s and is tunable
within ±200 MHz from the molecular resonance frequency while retaining roughly this stabil-
ity and accuracy.

2. Experimental Setup
The optical part of the setup consists of a ﬁber-coupled DFB laser (EP2051 series, Eblana
Photonics), an electro-optic modulator (EOM), two HC-PCFs of different length for probing
different molecular transitions, two ferrules per HC-PCF for gas ﬁlling and coupling of light in
and out of the HC-PCF, and a photo detector.

An overview of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The DFB laser comes in a
polarization-maintaining ﬁber-coupled butterﬂy package. Furthermore, a thermo-electric ele-
ment for temperature control at the mK level is integrated in the laser package. The light is split
after the laser using a ﬁber splitter, where 80 % is used as output light (4.3 mW) and 20 % is
used to generate an error signal for locking. The part of the light used for locking is ﬁrst phase
modulated at frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz using a ﬁber-coupled EOM (MPZ2000
series, Photline Technologies).

After modulation, the light is sent through the HC-PCF. The coupling between the PM/SM
ﬁbres used for the laser and the HC-PCF utilizes a ferrule method developed in-house at DFM
[7]. The HC-PCF is inserted into one end of a glass ferrule and an aspheric lens is attached
to the other end for coupling. To ensure optimal, alignment-free coupling the PM/SM ﬁbre
is connected to a free space coupler, which is bonded together with the HC-PCF ferrule. The
alignment and coupling are optimised using a 6-axis translational/rotational stage before gluing.
A glass tube attached to the side of the ferrule is used to ﬁrst evacuate and then ﬁll the HC-PCF
to the desired pressure. After ﬁlling the system is sealed by melting the side tube shut with a
blow torch. After travelling through the HC-PCF, the light is coupled into free space again and
detected on the high bandwidth (12 GHz) photo diode. Around 50 µW of the light reaches the
detector when the laser is tuned off resonance.

The HC-PCF employed in our setup is speciﬁcally designed to increase the frequency stabil-
ity of the laser lock. Mode interference in the HC-PCF has a negative inﬂuence on the frequency
stability, since it causes a varying dependence of the transmission on laser offset frequency,
which distorts the error signal of the lock unpredictably. Therefore, we designed and fabricated

a ﬁber for guidance around 2050 nm with suppression of higher order core modes. The ﬁber is a
7cell HC-PCF with reduced core wall thickness to enable single mode propagation at the short
wavelength region of the bandgap, similar to the one described in [8]. It has a cladding air ﬁlling
fraction of approximately 90 percent, a core diameter of 15 µm and a cladding pitch of 5 µm.

of the higher order mode content can be achieved using white light interferometric measure-
ments as described in references [1,9]. Using the same setup used in the characterization of the
HC-PCFs presented in [1], a windowed Fourier transform analysis can be used to temporally
separate the different modes and determine their effective group index difference with respect
to the fundamental mode. The high order modes travel with a different group velocity along
the HC-PCF with respect to the fundamental mode. This results in a relative delay of the wave
fronts between the modes which causes an interference occurring between the majority of the
light coupled into the fundamental mode and the other modes. A windowed Fourier transform
analysis allows one to separate the different modes in terms of the group velocity different with
respect to the fundamental one. To quantify this, light from a white light source was launched
with high NA into a 50 cm section of the HC-PCF. At the output end of the HC-PCF light was
collected with a single mode ﬁber and the resulting interferogram was recorded using a Yoko-
gawa AQ6375 spectrum analyzer. Figure 3 shows the differential group indices calculated from
the windowed Fourier transform of the interferogram. Here, it can be seen that the current ﬁber
has a higher order mode cut-off at around 2070 nm, below which the ﬁber only supports a single
spatial core mode. The relatively ﬂat response at a differential group index of approximately
0.1 is an artefact of the measurement equipment similar to the one observed in [1].
The complete optical part of the setup ﬁts in a compact box with dimensions (25 × 25 ×
5) cm3. The assembled optical box is presented in Fig. 4. The numbered components in the
ﬁgure are described in Table 1.

For increased versatility, we have produced two different HC-PCFs of different length, both
coupled, ﬁlled and sealed using the ferrule technique. Fiber 1 has a length of L1 = 10 m and was
ﬁlled with 12CO2 to a pressure of P1 = 35 hPa and the second ﬁber has L2 = 100 m and ﬁlled
to P2 = 55 hPa with 13CO2. Each ﬁber is coiled on a copper spool of 8 cm radius and the two
spools are placed on top of each other (see item 12 in Fig. 4). The pressure in the short ﬁber was
selected to optimize the error signal slope for the strong CO2 line at 2050.967 nm. Similarly,
the pressure in the long ﬁber was optimised for a different transition at 2050.7222 nm which
has a line strength roughly a factor 100 weaker than the strong line. Both ﬁbers can be used in
the optical setup by a simple change of input/output ﬁber connectors in the optics box. In this
work, we will concentrate on the results obtained from the short ﬁber with the strong transition
at 2050.967 nm.

The drive current and temperature regulation for the DFB laser is supplied to the optical
assembly from an external box containing all drive and control electronics (not shown in Fig.
4). Similarly, the RF signal driving the EOM is sent from the electronics box to the RF input of
the optical assembly. The signal from the light detected on the RF photo diode is split into DC
and RF parts by a bias-tee outside the box, and the RF signal is ampliﬁed before being mixed
with the LO at the modulation frequency. This produces an error signal used for locking. The
DC signal shows the molecular absorption and is used for frequency calibration and monitoring
of the lock status. The DC and error signals are shown in Fig. 5.

The design also features the possibility to temperature stabilize the spool holding the HC-
PCF (not shown in Fig. 1). This is done using a Peltier element inserted between the spool
and the bottom of the optics box. In the stable laboratory environment, however, it was found
unnecessary to stabilize the temperature. In a more noisy setting, stabilizing the temperature
might prove beneﬁcial to reduce ﬂuctuating transmission variations of the HC-PCF.

The signal processing and locking is controlled by a computer program through a National
Instruments DAQ board. The program can select the modulation frequency from one of two
VCOs in the ranges [250, 400] MHz and [1800, 3200] MHz. The program features the pos-
sibility to lock off resonance at a user-determined offset frequency in the ranges [-200, 200]
MHz and [±1900,±2800] MHz. For the low frequency offset an electronic offset is added to
the error signal obtained with low frequency modulation (∼ 320 MHz, as shown in Fig. 5)
before the PI circuit. This way, instead of locking at the frequency corresponding to the zero
crossing of the error signal, the PI circuit will lock the laser to value of the error signal corre-
sponding to the electronic offset. The relation between the electronic offset and the resulting
offset frequency is obtained by a calibration of the frequency axis in the control program. This
calibration sequence takes place automatically in the program and occurs at user-determined
time intervals.

The ﬁrst step in the calibration sequence is determining the zero detuning. The low frequency
VCO is set to the frequency where the last calibration found the optimum (i.e., largest) slope of

the error signal. The laser current is then scanned by sending a voltage ramp to the modulation
input of the current driver from the DAQ board. From here, the slope is optimised again by
changing the VCO frequency slightly. The slope is obtained by a linear ﬁt around the last
zero crossing value. Once the largest slope is determined, the scan voltage corresponding to
zero frequency offset is determined by the scan voltage where the error signal crosses zero
(corrected by a possible offset determined from residual amplitude modulation (RAM)). After
the zero offset scan voltage has been determined, the high frequency VCO is used to obtain the
scan voltage values for higher offset frequencies. The VCO is set to (2000, 2250, 2500, 2750,
3000) MHz and for each frequency, the corresponding scan voltage is found from the apogee
of a parabolic ﬁt to a zoom on the DC signal’s positive and negative sidebands from the EOM
modulation. After this procedure, eleven pairs of frequency offsets and scan voltage are found,
and a third order polynomium is ﬁtted to the points to relate the scan voltage to a frequency
offset.

3. Results
Once the calibration procedure is completed the laser can be locked at an offset frequency
selected by the user. The control program will then add a suitable electronic offset to the PI
circuit found from the calibration to lock the laser to the corresponding frequency offset from
resonance. The time series of a 65 hour measurement run with different offset frequencies is
shown in Fig. 6. The data was obtained from a frequency counter measuring the beat note

Fig. 6. The time series of the beat note frequency between the system investigated here and
a reference laser locked at resonance to a CO2-ﬁlled Brewster angled glass cell. The offset
frequency is changed every two hours with a re-calibration taking place before changing
the offset frequency. The initial offset is +50 MHz and is increased in steps of +50 MHz
after each re-calibration. After reaching +200 MHz the offset is set to -200 MHz. Note that
negative offset frequencies are also recorded as a positive beat note frequency. The numbers
(1) and (2) refer to selected periods for which the Allan deviation is plotted in Fig. 7.

Since the effective error signal slope decreases away from resonance, large offsets typically
display a higher instability than small offsets. Figure 7 shows the Allan deviation of two repre-
sentative measurements of +50 MHz and +200 MHz offset frequencies marked by (1) and (2)
in Fig. 6. On the times scale considered here (1 - 1000 s), both offset frequencies are mostly

dominated by ﬂicker noise ﬂoor, typically originating from electronic components - the +50
MHz offset at a level of around 6.5 kHz, or 4.4× 10−11 in relative units. The increased level of
ﬂicker noise in the +200 MHz offset for small time scale (around 1 s) corresponds roughly to
the decrease in the error signal slope at this offset (and therefore also a decrease in the signal-
to-noise ratio of the lock). At later times the +200 MHz shows beginning signs of frequency
random walk (the Allan deviation increasing with τ1/2) and frequency drift (increasing with τ),
likely due to systematic effects such as baseline variations.

Figure 8 shows a compilation of the average value of actual offset frequencies for +50 MHz
and +200 MHz set points spanning a total of 16 days. The overall average value with standard
deviation is noted for both +50 MHz and +200 MHz in Fig. 8. While the low frequency offset
value is quite close to the set point, the high frequency value is not. By analyzing different
offsets we observed that the difference from the set point scales linearly with offset frequency
and is due to a 4 % underestimation of the scaling factor from the scan voltage to frequency
offset calibration, most likely due to non-linearity in the laser scan during calibration. This can
be compensated for by correcting the offset in the control software. If such a compensation
is carried out, the actual offset frequency will be within ±2 MHz of the selected value. The
consistency and accuracy of the offset lock is a result of the inherent stability of the error signal
amplitude due to the compact and robust optical system. Combining this with the automatic
calibration procedure ensures that the added electronic offset always corresponds to the desired
frequency.

4. Conclusion
We have demonstrated a compact, ﬁber-based setup for frequency locking of a DFB laser to
a CO2 transition at 2050.967 nm. The frequency of the laser can be locked up to ±200 MHz
away from resonance without the need of a second laser, thus reducing the complexity of the
setup - something especially useful in space applications. An automated calibration sequence
ensures the long term accuracy of the offset frequency. Close to resonance the accuracy of the
locked laser frequency is better than 2 MHz with a stability of 6.5 kHz between 1 and 100
seconds. The current limitation to the short term stability is the signal-to-noise ratio in the error
signal used for locking. This could be improved with more optical power, and a better detec-
tion/ampliﬁcation system. The long term accuracy is mostly dominated by baseline variations
in transmission of the ﬁber as well as residual amplitude modulation from RF pickup in the
ampliﬁcation chain.

When baseline variations in the ﬁber transmission are small, the hollow-core ﬁber is a well-
suited gas cell for locking to weak Doppler broadened molecular lines, since it is possible to
achieve a very long path length (up to at least 100 m) while not being limited by wall collisions
and/or transit time broadening. The gas ﬁlled into the ﬁber is not limited to CO2, it can be ﬁlled
with a large range of molecules relevant for, e.g., atmospheric measurements.
