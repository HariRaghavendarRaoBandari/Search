ABSTRACT

Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars are relatively short
lived (less than a few Myr), yet their cool eﬀective temperatures, high luminosities,
eﬃcient mass-loss and dust production can dramatically eﬀect the chemical enrichment
histories and the spectral energy distributions of their host galaxies. The ability to
accurately model TP-AGB stars is critical to the interpretation of the integrated light

of distant galaxies, especially in redder wavelengths. We continue previous eﬀorts to
constrain the evolution and lifetimes of TP-AGB stars by modeling their underlying
stellar populations. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and near-infrared
photometry taken of 12 ﬁelds of 10 nearby galaxies imaged via the ACS Nearby Galaxy
Survey Treasury and the near-infrared HST/SNAP follow-up campaign, we compare
the model and observed TP-AGB luminosity functions as well as the number ratio of
TP-AGB to red giant branch stars. We conﬁrm the best-ﬁtting mass-loss prescription,
introduced by Rosenﬁeld et al. (2014), in which two diﬀerent wind regimes are active
during the TP-AGB, signiﬁcantly improves models of many galaxies that show evidence
of recent star formation. This study extends previous eﬀorts to constrain TP-AGB

lifetimes to metallicities ranging −1.59 (cid:46) [Fe/H] (cid:46) −0.56 and initial TP-AGB masses
up to ∼ 4M(cid:12), which include TP-AGB stars that undergo hot-bottom burning.

Introduction

Thermally Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars are fascinating in their structural
complexity, their short lifetimes, and the dramatic impacts they have on their host galaxies. TP-
AGB stars are known as important sources of dust (e.g., Gail & Sedlmayr 1985, 1999; Gehrz 1989;
Boyer et al. 2012; Melbourne & Boyer 2013), they chemically enrich their ISM (e.g., Marigo 2001;
Ventura et al. 2001; Karakas & Lattanzio 2007), and they are critical to the interpretation of the
spectral energy distributions of high-redshift galaxies (e.g., Bertoldi et al. 2003; Valiante et al. 2009;
Conroy et al. 2009; Melbourne et al. 2012).

A full comprehension of the TP-AGB phase and its eﬀects on its environment is critical to
understanding galaxies’ near and far infrared light output. However, TP-AGB stellar evolution
is complex, with double shell fusion, large convective events (third dredge up), fusion at the base
of the convective envelope (hot-bottom burning; HBB, for initial TP-AGB masses (cid:38) 3M(cid:12)), and
pulsations that help to create dust and eventually drive the mass loss rate. As a consequence, even
its most basic evolutionary property – the TP-AGB lifetime – diﬀers greatly from set to set of
evolutionary calculations (which can be appreciated in Figure 3 of Girardi & Marigo 2007a).

The strongest observational constraints on TP-AGB lifetimes ﬁrst came from resolved stellar
populations in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; Frogel et al. 1990; van Loon et al. 2005; Girardi &

Marigo 2007a) and then nearby galaxies (Girardi & Marigo 2007a; Rosenﬁeld et al. 2014). The MCs
clusters are natural laboratories for studying the TP-AGB phase as there are many clusters with
well deﬁned main sequence turn-oﬀs (e.g., Gallagher et al. 1996; Holtzman et al. 1999; Geha et al.
1998; Olsen 1999), known distances (e.g., Pietrzy´nski et al. 2013), deep optical and IR observations
(Meixner et al. 2006; Blum et al. 2006), and known metallicities (e.g., Bica et al. 1998; Ferraro
et al. 2006; Dirsch et al. 2000; Hill et al. 2000; Cole et al. 2005; Da Costa & Hatzidimitriou 1998;
Geisler et al. 2003). However, individual MC clusters lack a statistically signiﬁcant population of
TP-AGB stars, which has lead some researchers to combine information from MC clusters based
on age and derive TP-AGB lifetime constraints from ensemble populations (e.g., Frogel et al. 1990;
Girardi & Marigo 2007a; No¨el et al. 2013). This method is now seen as problematic given many
MC clusters happen to be of an age that temporarily boosts the number counts of TP-AGB stars,
falsely signifying a longer lifetime. However, TP-AGB “boosting” does not eliminate MC clusters
or ﬁelds from constraining the TP-AGB, it requires an extra calibration step to determine the
amount of boosting when modeling stellar populations of ∼ 1.6 Gyr (see Girardi et al. 2013).

Outside the MCs, star clusters and ﬁelds containing signiﬁcant numbers of TP-AGB stars
are rarely be observed down to the old main sequence turn-oﬀ; however, modern color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) ﬁtting techniques allow their star formation histories (SFHs) to be well constrained
up to distances of about 4 Mpc for high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (e.g.,
Dolphin 2002; Weisz et al. 2011). Such imaging was obtained via the HST/ACS Nearby Galaxy
Survey Treasury (ANGST; Dalcanton et al. 2009), which surveyed a volume limited sample of ∼ 70
nearby galaxies from 1-4 Mpc in optical ACS and WFPC2 ﬁlters. ANGST galaxies show a wide
diversity of SFHs (see e.g., Weisz et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2013) and present a multitude of
candidate TP-AGB stars at a range of metallicities.

Girardi et al. (2010, hereafter G10) used ANGST galaxies that showed little-to-no recent SF
to constrain lifetimes of low mass, low metallicity TP-AGB stars by suggesting a phase of mass loss
before the onset of dust driven winds (pre-dust). Rosenﬁeld et al. (2014, hereafter R14) extended the
G10 galaxy sample by incorporating near-infrared imaging from a followup HST/SNAP campaign
(AGB-SNAP; Dalcanton et al. 2012) and presented a mass loss prescription that best represents
the optical and near-infrared (NIR) luminosity functions (LFs) of seven galaxies which also showed
little-to-no recent SF. Both studies used the most likely SF history of each galaxy to produce stellar
population synthesis models, which were used to compare the mean predicted TP-AGB lifetimes to
the data using the ratio of TP-AGB stars to red giant branch (RGB) stars (NTP−AGB/NRGB). R14
further performed a calibration of the TP-AGB mass-loss prescriptions by comparing the shapes
of the predicted and observed luminosity functions. However, due to the lack of recent SF in the
selected galaxies in both programs, the TP-AGB stars studied were restricted to initial masses
∼ 0.8 − 2.5M(cid:12) and metallicities −1.54 < [Fe/H] < −0.86. In this paper, we extend the analysis
of G10 and R14 to include 10 more galaxies of the AGB-SNAP sample that show evidence of
recent SF, and probe a metallicity range of −1.59 (cid:46) [Fe/H] (cid:46) −0.56, and an initial mass range of
∼ 0.8 − 4M(cid:12) of stars that may eventually populate the TP-AGB, importantly including TP-AGB

stars that may undergo HBB. The paper is outlined as follows: in Section 2 we brieﬂy describe the
observations, photometry, and data reduction used in this project, and present the re-derivation of
SFHs and a new method of identifying TP-AGB stars in galaxies with recent SF. In Section 3 we
review the R14 TP-AGB model that we test against the observations. We model the data using
population synthesis described in Section 4. We compare the population synthesis models to the
observations in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.

2. Data

2.1. Galaxy Sample

The galaxy sample derives from Melbourne et al. (2012, hereafter M12), who developed 23
resolved stellar source catalogs of 22 galaxies that matched the AGB-SNAP (HST/WFC3) NIR
data with the ANGST (HST/ACS or WFPC2) optical data. We selected 12 ﬁelds of 10 galaxies
from M12 that show evidence of recent SF (and were not one of the 7 galaxies studied in R14).

Detailed information on the galaxies in this study can be found in Dalcanton et al. (2009,
2012). Brieﬂy, they are all dwarf spheroidal or dwarf irregular galaxies with the exceptions of
NGC 2403 and NGC 300. In the case of NGC 2403, we study a deep (WFPC2) ﬁeld in the disk
of the galaxy as well as a shallower halo (ACS) ﬁeld (c.f. Figure 2, Williams et al. 2013) and we
use two ﬁelds of UGC 4305 (HoII) with similar SFH. Some parameters of interest of these galaxies
are presented in Table 1 below, and typical optical-NIR CMDs from the M12 matched catalogs are
presented in Figure 3.

We make use of the ANGST optical data, AGB-SNAP NIR data, the M12 matched catalogs
and the corresponding artiﬁcial star tests (ASTs) in this study. Following the methodology of R14,
we re-calculate the SFHs using the same stellar evolutionary models that we use in our population
synthesis code. In order to have best leverage on the SFH, we use the optical ANGST data which
reaches several magnitudes below the tip of the RGB (TRGB), usually beyond the red clump. The
AGB-SNAP NIR data (as part of the M12 matched catalogs) have a more complete census of TP-
AGB stars than the optical ANGST data so we use them to compare against our simulated stellar
populations. Finally, artiﬁcial star tests are employed in the SFH derivation, applied to make
completeness corrections to the observed LFs (see Figure 6), and used to simulate statistically
similar uncertainties and crowding in the modeled stellar populations. We now brieﬂy discuss the
reduction and photometry of each catalog, and the construction of the M12 four-ﬁlter catalogs.

2.2. Reduction and Photometry

tered and reduced as part of the University of Washington photometry pipeline, which uses the
DOLPHOT package2 (Dolphin 2000) and the ACS, WFC3, or WFPC2 module. Brieﬂy we use
the “good” (gst) star catalogs that apply conservative limits of the DOLPHOT ﬂags: sharpness,
(sharp1 + sharp2)2 ≤ 0.075; crowding, crowd1 + crowd2 ≤ 0.1; signal-to-noise, S/N > 4; and
flag < 8 (i.e., not extended, elongated, highly saturated, or signiﬁcantly cut oﬀ by CCD chip
edges).

We refer the reader to M12 for complete details on the construction of the four-ﬁlter NIR-
optical matched catalog and only outline the methodology here. To create the matched catalogs,
M12 transformed the NIR data set coordinate system to that of the optical using 150 bright,
spatially dispersed red stars in the DOLPHOT output catalogs (which were also input to the
ANGST gst catalogs). The transformation was calculated iteratively (with the MATCH routine
developed by Michael Richmond); ﬁrst they found a linear ﬁt between the coordinate systems and
then used the ﬁt as starting point for a quadratic solution. M12 reports 90% of the stars in the
NIR catalogs are matched to within 0.07(cid:48)(cid:48) of a star in the optical catalogs.

2.3. Star Formation Histories

Star formation histories were calculated using the calcsfh routine in the MATCH package (Dol-
phin 2002). MATCH is a CMD-ﬁtting package that ﬁnds the most likely SFH and metallicity evolution
of an input CMD given an IMF, binary fraction, uncertainties and completeness of the photometry,
and stellar evolution models. We adopted the Kroupa (2001) IMF and a binary fraction of 0.35
with a ﬂat distribution of secondary masses. The faint limits of the photometry were set to the 50%
completeness limit determined by the artiﬁcial star tests, listed in Table 5 of Dalcanton et al. (2009).
For the stellar evolution models, we use a subset of the PAdova TRieste Stellar Evolution Code
(PARSEC V1.2S) stellar evolution tracks (Bressan et al. 2012, 2013) (discussed below). Finally,
we adopted a binning scheme in color-magnitude space of 0.05 and 0.1 respectively, and metallicity
(as log Z) of 0.15 dex. We further allowed MATCH to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting distance and extinction.
However, in the cases where calcsfh did not converge to within 0.05 dex of the distance modulus
or AV value derived from TRGB ﬁtting (Dalcanton et al. 2009), we adopted their values to ensure
the model CMDs agreed to within a pixel of the binned data.

PARSEC was also used in R14 to derive the SFHs since it calculates the ﬁrst thermal pulse
used in the COLIBRI TP-AGB models (Marigo et al. 2013). Since R14, PARSEC has undergone
signiﬁcant updates, the largest of which extended the upper mass limit of the models from 12
M(cid:12) to 350 M(cid:12) in certain metallicities (Tang et al. 2014) and presented new low-mass stellar
evolution models (Chen et al. 2015). To import PARSEC for use in MATCH, we redeﬁned PARSEC
equivalent stellar evolutionary points (i.e., interpolation points along a stellar evolution track) such

2http://purcell.as.arizona.edu/dolphot/

– 6 –

that each track has a uniform number of points and equidistant spacing between them. As MATCH
requires a complete and regular grid in mass and metallicity, this resulted in PARSEC V1.2S in
MATCH having a diﬀerent parameter range than the full PARSEC V1.2S. In MATCH, the PARSEC
V1.2S grid covers a mass range of 0.1 M(cid:12) ≤ M ≤ 120 M(cid:12) which translates to an age range of
3.55 Myr ≤ Age ≤ 15.8 Gyr and a metallicity range from −2.18 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0.42 (the full grid of
PARSEC V1.2S tracks reaches [Fe/H] = 0.6 and younger ages). Finally, the BC transformations
of the stellar models occur within MATCH, and use those speciﬁed in Girardi et al. (2008), which
largely rely on the Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model atmospheres.

With the above parameter search space, we re-ﬁt the program galaxies using the optical data
from ANGST and ASTs described in Dalcanton et al. (2009) and Weisz et al. (2011). Following
the method of G10 and R14, we excluded stars above the TRGB from the ﬁtting (using the TRGB
magnitudes calculated in Dalcanton et al. 2012). While G10 found very small or no diﬀerences in
measured SFH including or not including TP-AGB stars, we excluded them from the data as we
had not yet ported model TP-AGB stars into MATCH and did not want to introduce bias due to the
ﬁtting algorithm ﬁnding high S/N data where there were no model points.

The last four columns of Table 1 list the relative amounts of recent SF and corresponding
average metallicities for the galaxy sample. Cumulative SFHs are shown in Figure 1 with random
uncertainties calculated with the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm implemented as the hybridMC
routine in MATCH and described in Dolphin (2013). All SFH ﬁts are consistent to less than 0.01%
level except for the KDG 73 ﬁt which is consistent to 0.12%.

The program targets already have measured SFH using MATCH (Weisz et al. 2011; Dalcanton
et al. 2012; Melbourne et al. 2012) with the exceptions of the ﬁelds of NGC 2403 and NGC 300
which were separately studied in detail in Williams et al. (2013) and Gogarten et al. (2010). All
of the above previous SFH determinations were calculated with slightly diﬀerent stellar models
(Padua; Girardi et al. 2010; Marigo et al. 2008). Therefore it is worth comparing the published
results to our new SFH derivations.

To compare the SFHs calculated with either the PARSEC or the Padua models, we overplot
the systematic uncertainties from Weisz et al. (2011) in Figure 1. The systematic uncertainties were
estimated by deriving the SFH of a synthetic CMD with a diﬀerent set of stellar evolution models
than were inputted and applying the uncertainties to the galaxy’s SFH solution. For example,
Weisz et al. (2011) produce a synthetic CMD using BaSTI models (Pietrinferni et al. 2004) and
then derive the SFH of that synthetic CMD using Padua models. The oﬀsets between the input
SFH that created the synthetic CMD and the output SFH are related to systematic uncertainties
in the stellar models (for full details of this method, see Dolphin 2012). We include systematic
uncertainties as a visual guide to the range of possible SFHs, though we do not expect diﬀerences
from Padua to PARSEC to be nearly as great as are seen between BaSTI-Padua. Furthermore, it
should be noted that for these data, using one stellar evolution model instead of another will not
produce totally incomparable SFHs (assuming the age, mass and metallicity ranges of the models

– 7 –

are comparable, c.f. Dolphin 2012).

The cumulative SFHs are within uncertainties with the exceptions of NGC 4163 and UGC 5139,
where Weisz et al. (2011) calculate relatively suppressed SF at ages older than ∼ 10 Gyr compared
to our solutions. The discrepancies between PARSEC and Padua SFH solutions for these two
galaxies clearly go beyond the systematic uncertainties calculated by Weisz et al. (2011) at the
oldest ages (and therefore lowest masses, where some of the largest upgrades to the Padua models
occurred, Chen et al. 2014). However, as we now show, the apparently large deviations at old ages
do not aﬀect the relative mass distribution of the TP-AGB and can be neglected for this study.

The top panel of Figure 2 shows the cumulative SFH of UGC 5139 reproduced from Figure
1 which used PARSEC models as input. Over-plotted is the cumulative SFH from Weisz et al.
(2011), who used Padua models as the stellar evolution models in MATCH. In the bottom panel,
the inferred mass distributions calculated using TRILEGAL and the R14 TP-AGB models (see Sec-
tion 4) are shown for each SFH in 0.1 M(cid:12) bins. Despite the clear oﬀsets in the ancient SFR
and mass distribution of the inferred stellar population, the relative TP-AGB mass distribution
hardly changes. Furthermore, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Kolmogoroﬀ 1933; Smirnov 1948)3 of
the TP-AGB mass distribution resulted in DKS statistic of 0.036 and a p-value of 0.9995, there-
fore we can reject the null hypothesis, which indicates that the SFHs from previous studies using
MATCH/Padua give statistically indistinguishable TP-AGB populations compared to those produced
with MATCH/PARSECv1.2s.

2.4.

Identifying TP-AGB Stars

The region of TP-AGB stars in an optical-NIR CMD are easy to identify by eye, as TP-AGB
stars are the brightest and reddest when present (see Figure 3). However the boundary in CMD
space near the TRGB as well as the blue edge of TP-AGB can contain RGB stars and red core
Helium burning (RHeB) stars, respectively. Confusing RGB and RHeB stars as TP-AGB stars
will erroneously increase the apparent number of TP-AGB stars in the observations which will be
interpreted as longer TP-AGB lifetimes.

We exclude RGB and RHeB stars and thereby isolate TP-AGB stars in the following way.
First, to exclude RGB counts in the NTP−AGB/NRGB ratio we continue the method of R14 and
exclude a ±0.2 mF160W band around the TRGB. To minimize the contribution of RHeB stars
counted as TP-AGB we used the M12 matched catalogs to ﬁnd an approximate separation line in
CMD space between TP-AGB stars and the RHeB sequence.

We ﬁrst estimated the RHeB TP-AGB separation line for all of the galaxies stacked together

and then tested its adequacy on each individual galaxy to reﬁne the slope and intercept.

To stack the galaxies, we shifted all the optical-NIR data to absolute magnitudes using the
distance modulii and extinction values (AV ) calculated in Dalcanton et al. (2009) and Dalcanton
et al. (2012) and corrected the AV values to the extinction values of the ﬁlters in question using
coeﬃcients derived from Cardelli et al. (1989) with an extinction curve with RV =3.1 applied to a
G2V star (AF 160W /AV = 0.6056 and AF 814W /AV = 0.2044, see Girardi et al. 2008).

We tested the initial separation line by ﬁtting a double Gaussian distribution as a function of
absolute F 160W magnitude for each ﬁeld within the color limits F 814W −F 160W = [1, 3] using
Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization4. We then calculated the expected numbers of
stars from each Gaussian on each side of the separating line for each magnitude bin within the
color limits.

We set the magnitude bins with the binning algorithm from Knuth (2006) implemented in the
astroML package (Vanderplas et al. 2012). The resulting slope works well in many of the most
populated systems, however it fails in the regime where a single Gaussian can provide a better ﬁt
than a double, a scenario usually due to an under-populated RHeB or a large color dispersion of
the TP-AGB (a sign of an intrinsic metallicity spread).

We also found that the slope calculated worked well for all galaxies, but we needed to further
take into account the intrinsic oﬀsets in the color of the RGB from galaxy to galaxy due diﬀerences
in metallicity. Therefore, we adjusted the separation line to include a TRGB color term. The
resulting line can be reproduced following the equation:

– 12 –

MF160W = −7.0 − 9.03[(MF814W − MF160W) −

(MF814W − MF160W)TRGB] .

An example of this procedure is shown in Figure 3. With this method, we ﬁnd for each ﬁeld,
RHeB stars do not contribute to the TP-AGB by more than 5% and conversely, fewer than 6% of
TP-AGB stars are found in the RHeB region (mean of 3%). We veriﬁed this result using TRILEGAL
in stellar population synthesis mode and added photometric uncertainties from the ASTs (the same
method as discussed below in Section 3). Since we are able to track the individual stellar phases in
the TRILEGAL simulated stellar catalog, we ﬁnd the mean contamination by RHeB stars to be 3%
and the fraction of AGB stars (both TP-AGB and Early-AGB) “lost” to the RHeB region is never
more than 4%.

Stars red-ward of the separation line and brighter than the TRGB are considered TP-AGB
stars in the following analysis. The number of TP-AGB stars identiﬁed in each galaxy ﬁeld is listed
in the ﬁrst two columns of Table 2.

3. TP-AGB Evolution Models

The TP-AGB models tested here are essentially the same as in R14, the full set spans initial
TP-AGB masses from 0.50 < M < 6.0 M(cid:12) and a metallicity range of 0.0005 < Z < 0.06 (−1.48 <
[Fe/H] < 0.60). Obviously, we are limited by the metallicities in the data set and only test the lower
end of the calculated metallicity range. Brieﬂy, the TP-AGB models incorporate the following main
characteristics:

• The conditions at the ﬁrst thermal pulse on the AGB are extracted from PARSEC V1.2S

stellar evolution models.

• The TP evolution is computed with the COLIBRI code which is extensively described in
Marigo et al. (2013). The code includes several innovative features for instance, detailed
nucleosynthesis calculations both during the thermal pulses and the interpulse phase, and on-
the-ﬂy computation of atomic and molecular abundances and their Rosseland mean opacities
(Marigo & Aringer 2009) as the envelope composition changes along the evolution due to
mixing events and/or HBB. A few key processes are parameterized, such as the eﬃciency of
third dredge-up episodes and the eﬃciency of mass loss.

• A complete nuclear network that includes the proton-proton chains, the CNO, NeNa, MgAl
cycles and several (α, γ) and (α, n) reactions is coupled to a time-dependent diﬀusive descrip-
tion of convection to follow the nucleosynthesis in the HBB phases of massive TP-AGB stars.
The concentrations of the most abundant elements in the pulse-driven convection zone (e.g.,
4He, 12C, 16O, 22Ne, 24,25Mg) are also predicted solving a proper nuclear network.

• For the mass loss, we adopt a 2-phase formalism, which includes: the pre-dust phase ( ˙Mpd)
using a modiﬁed version of the Schr¨oder & Cuntz (2005) formula, inspired by the theoret-
ical work of Cranmer & Saar (2011) on Alfv`en waves and atmospheric turbulence; and the
pulsation-assisted dust-driven phase ( ˙Mdd) following a formula similar to Bedijn (1988) but
with parameters calibrated with a sample of Galactic Miras. The super-wind mass-loss ( ˙Msw)
is assumed not to exceed a maximum limit which is determined according to Vassiliadis &
Wood (1993). The largest mass loss between these two prescriptions is adopted as the reported
mass loss.

Low mass TP-AGB stars with the above mass loss prescriptions are fully discussed in R14 so
we remark on the higher mass TP-AGB stars. The evolution of two TP-AGB stars with initial
mass M = 4.0M(cid:12) and metallicities Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.008 ([Fe/H] = −1.18,−0.28) are shown in
Figure 4. Each vertical panel shows a diﬀerent feature as a function of TP-AGB age (motivated by
Vassiliadis & Wood 1993), from top to bottom: the eﬀective temperature, temperature at the base
of the convective envelope, luminosity, surface Carbon to Oxygen ratio (C/O; with a horizontal
dashed line at C/O = 1), stellar mass, and mass loss rate. Vertical dotted lines separate the mass-
loss regimes discussed above. The over luminous structure of the lower metallicity track (second
from the top panel, left side of Figure 4) is an eﬀect of strong HBB which increases with decreasing
metallicity (for a given stellar mass) due to higher temperatures at the base of the convective
envelope.

Pre-dust mass loss is important across the full span of TP-AGB mass and metallicities, though
decreasingly so with increasing metallicity. Figure 5 shows TP-AGB stars with initial masses
between 3 − 5 M(cid:12) (calculated at mass steps of ∆M = 0.2M(cid:12) at two low metallicities (Z =
0.001, 0.008 or [Fe/H] = −1.18,−0.28). The left panels show the fraction of time a TP-AGB star of
a given initial mass spends in the pre-dust, pulsation-assisted dust-driven, and super wind phases.
The right panels shows the amount of mass lost in each of those phases as a function of initial TP-
AGB mass. Generally, the amount of time spent in the pre-dust phase increases with decreasing
initial mass while the amount of mass lost from the pre-dust phase is roughly constant with mass
(with the exception of the high mass Z=0.008 TP-AGB stars, which shows a slight decrease in
mass lost with increasing initial TP-AGB mass). With increasing metallicity, we can expect an
overall decrease in the duration of the pre-dust phase as it becomes easier to make dust at lower
eﬀective temperatures, so the pulsation-assisted dust-driven wind phase will take over sooner. It
is interesting to note the amount of mass lost in the low metallicity pre-dust phase is comparable
to the mass lost in the super wind phase, and at increasing metallicity, the pre-dust winds are
responsible for a comparable amount of mass lost as is lost to the pulsation-assisted dust driven
winds. However, the trends described above are derived with a simpliﬁed prescription for AGB
mass loss. We postpone to future works the application of state-of-the-art dynamical models of
AGB atmospheres (H¨ofner 2008; Bladh et al. 2013; Eriksson et al. 2014) for more accurate and
physically-grounded predictions of the relative eﬀects of the pre-dust wind and the dust-driven
wind as a function of mass an metallicity.

convective envelope, luminosity, C/O ratio (with C/O = 1 as a dotted horizontal line), star mass,
and mass loss rate. HBB is stronger at lower metallicities due to higher temperatures at the base
of the convective zone. HBB does not occur in the higher metallicity TP-AGB star, which exhibits
a constant increase in the C/O ratio and does not show the bell-shape increase in stellar luminosity
exhibited by the lower metallicity star.

Shown are initial masses between 3−5 M(cid:12) at diﬀerent metallicities, Z = 0.001, 0.008 (top, bottom).
Pre-dust mass loss is less eﬃcient than the other phases, however it lasts for the largest proportion of
intermediate-mass TP-AGB lifetimes. This trend makes the mass lost to pre-dust winds comparable
to the mass lost during the dust-driven winds for lower masses and higher metallcities. For higher
masses and lower metallicities, the mass lost in pre-dust winds is comparable to that lost in the
super-wind phase.

4. Modeling the Data

To model the data with TP-AGB stars, we use the population synthesis code TRILEGAL, initially
designed to simulate foreground stars in the Milky Way (Girardi et al. 2005), it is also able to
simulate galaxies of known distance, mean extinction and SFH. TRILEGAL uses as input the PARSEC
V1.2S models. Although such models are computed at constant mass, mass loss during the RGB
is taken into account internally by TRILEGAL at the phase of isochrone construction. We adopt
RGB mass loss described by Reimers (1975) with a multiplicative factor η = 0.2 (Miglio et al.
2012), which typically produces just a modest (of the order of ∼ 0.2 M(cid:12) at most) change in the
initial mass of the RGB and TP-AGB stars considered in this work5.

Since Girardi & Marigo (2007b), TRILEGAL incorporates TP-AGB stars taking into account a
series of their most basic evolutionary and spectral properties. For the present paper, suﬃce it to
mention that the photometric properties are simulated taking fully into account the presence of
L and Teﬀ variations due to the thermal-pulse cycles, and the changes both in the photospheric
spectra and in dust-reprocessing properties taking place as the stars transit between O-rich and C-
rich conﬁgurations (with either C/O<1 or >1, where C/O is the surface carbon-to-oxygen number
ratio). A detailed description of how these processes are implemented can be found in Marigo
et al. (2008) and Aringer et al. (2009). In particular, here we assume the dust properties of the
60% aluminum oxyde + 40% silicate mixture for O-rich stars, and 85% amorphous carbon +
15% silicon carbide mixture for C-rich stars (Groenewegen 2006). In addition, the present code
presents some relatively minor updates that are discussed in Marigo et al. (2016). We ignore the
photometric changes due to the long-period variability, since its eﬀect is relatively small in the NIR,
and since at low metallicities a major fraction of the TP-AGB stars pulsate just in low-amplitude
overtone modes. Therefore, pulsation is not expected to change the bulk numbers nor the LFs of
the TP-AGB stars we predict for the present sample of galaxies.

For each galaxy, we follow the same method as R14, brieﬂy, we sample the random uncertainties
in the SFH to produce ∼ 100 TRILEGAL stellar populations of an arbitrarily large total mass and
apply photometric uncertainty and completeness information from the data by applying ASTs to
each simulation. To account for the mass diﬀerence between our simulation and the observation,
we scale the simulation to match the number of a subset of RGB stars in M12’s four ﬁlter matched
catalogs.

To select the RGB stars to scale the simulation, unlike R14, we can not uniformly apply the
same F 110W −F 160W color cut to exclude possible main sequence contaminants, as the galaxies
in our program also have a large number of RHeB stars. Instead, the RGB subset is deﬁned by a
box in optical-NIR CMD space with magnitude limits set at the F 160W TRGB and 1 mag below.
The blue F 814W−F 160W limit of the RGB box is set at 0.2 mag bluer than the F 814W − F 160W

5As mentioned in passing in R14, the R14 pre-dust mass loss prescription may be too eﬃcient to extend to the

lower luminosities of RGB stars.

– 18 –

TRGB color, which nicely maps to the integrated B-band magnitude, MBT (Karachentsev et al.
2004) as the slope of the RGB is primarily set by the metallicity (e.g, see Section 6 of Dalcanton
et al. 2012). Finally, the width of the RGB box is set to 0.4 mag for galaxies with MBT > −17
and 0.6 mag for galaxies brighter (see Figure 3), as it is reasonable to expect at constant T Type,
higher mass galaxies had more metallicity evolution, and therefore show a larger spread in RGB
color.

5. Analysis

Using many galaxies to constrain TP-AGB evolution has added beneﬁts beyond statistically
large samples of TP-AGB stars. The more galaxies available, the less the resultant constraints are
subject to a speciﬁc TP-AGB population and a speciﬁc SFH. However, these beneﬁts come with
their own limitations, we only derive model constraints from the mean properties of the observed
TP-AGB populations and therefore do not tune models of one speciﬁc combination of age, mass,
and metallicity. Our models are deemed satisfactory when they reach broad agreement to the
largest span of age, metallicity, and mass accessible from our galaxy sample. Below we present
three comparisons of the R14 models to the galaxy sample. First we calculate the relative number
of TP-AGB stars to RGB stars, the NTP−AGB/NRGB ratio; second, we compare the shape of
the observed and predicted LFs, and ﬁnally we compare the ﬂux contribution of TP-AGB stars
compared the integrated F 160W ﬂux of the image.

5.1. Ratio of TP-AGB to RGB Stars

The comparison between the observed and predicted NTP−AGB/NRGB ratio is a rough estimate
how well the predicted mean lifetimes of TP-AGB stars agree with those observed. The general
assumption is that the number of stars in a given portion of a CMD is related to the amount of
time they spend in that portion of the CMD. If by experimental design, the CMD ﬁlters are set
to optimize the separation of stellar evolution phases, this allows researchers to measure relative
lifetimes of diﬀerent evolutionary phases. Table 2 lists the numbers of TP-AGB stars found in the
data (column 1) and predicted in the model (column 2), and the NTP−AGB/NRGB for each ﬁeld
(column 3). The model NTP−AGB/NRGB listed for each ﬁeld is the median of the ∼ 100 TRILEGAL
models (column 4). The fractional diﬀerences between model and data (column 5) serve as a
comparison. Each column also contains Poisson uncertainties. A fractional diﬀerence of 0 would
mean a perfect agreement and negative values indicate a relative overproduction of model TP-AGB
stars compared to the number observed.

From ﬁeld to ﬁeld, the fractional diﬀerence varies largely, from nearly 65% over production
of TP-AGB stars (UGCA 292) to nearly 40% underproduction (KDG 73). Due to uncertainties
in SFH (see Section 2.3) and variations in TP-AGB populations from galaxy to galaxy, it is more

– 19 –

useful to combine the measurements for a rough estimate on the adequacy of the model. Taking
the mean NTP−AGB/NRGB of the data and model shows a fractional diﬀerence of 9%, meaning the
R14 models show good agreement though slightly under predict the mean TP-AGB lifetimes based
on these observations.

5.2. Luminosity Functions in the Optical and NIR

Model and observed LFs are shown in Figure 6. The M12 catalog LFs (dark gray) are complete-
ness corrected using the ANGST and AGB-SNAP ASTs and are shown with Poisson uncertainties
calculated for each magnitude bin. The ∼ 100 model LFs are combined and shown as 67% con-
ﬁdence level intervals shaded in gray. The TP-AGB stars, identiﬁed by the method discussed in
Section 2.4, are shown for the data (red) and for the model (blue) with the same conﬁdence level
intervals as the full LF (shaded blue). Vertical lines in each plot show the TRGB and 0.2 mag region
around the TRGB excluded from the NTP−AGB/NRGB calculations (see Section 2.4). The fainter
vertical line outlines the RGB box magnitude (but not color) limits used to scale the TRILEGAL
simulations. Finally, the top of each panel shows the listing from Table 2 of the number of TP-AGB
and RGB stars observed and modeled as well as the corresponding NTP−AGB/NRGB ratios.

The LFs all follow the same trends, nearly a power-law in the F160W at magnitudes faintward
of the TRGB, and some degree of agreement and spread in the TP-AGB region (brightward of the
TRGB). The departure from a power-law of the observations at faint magnitudes, especially in the
optical (despite being completeness corrected), is due to stars not detected in both F814W and
F160W in the M12 four-ﬁlter matched catalogs. In nearly every galaxy in both ﬁlters, the spread
in the model TP-AGB LF from random SFH uncertainties is consistent with the data TP-AGB
LF. The exceptions are the optical LFs of NGC 300-WIDE1, UGC 4305-1, and UGC 5139 where
the model under-predicts the number of TP-AGB stars ∼ 0.5 mag brighter than the TRGB.

5.3. Flux Contribution of TP-AGB Stars

One issue quantiﬁed by in the M12 study was the over-production of TP-AGB stars using the
Padua models outside of the MCs. With the R14 models, it is worth revisiting the issue of the ﬂux
contribution of TP-AGB stars. Figure 7 is a reproduction of Figure 7 of M12 (gray) with our results
over plotted (blue). Perfect agreement between data and model would be a ratio equaling 1, which
is shown as a black solid horizontal line. Mean values for each model is shown as a dashed line.
The Marigo et al. (2008) model (gray diamonds) emphasize the initial problem of extrapolating
models calibrated in the MCs alone. On average, they over-predict both the number counts of
TP-AGB stars (left panel) and the NIR (F 160W ) TP-AGB ﬂux (right panel). The G10 models
(gray squares), with the introduction of pre-dust mass loss, drastically reduce the oﬀsets apparent
in the Marigo et al. (2008) model. In contrast, the R14 models show the best agreement on average

– 20 –

for both the observed number counts of TP-AGB stars (0.80) as well as the TP-AGB ﬂux (0.90).

Finally, we present the relative age and mass distributions of TP-AGB stars in Figure 8 and a

more detailed distribution of the simulated TP-AGB mass distributions in Figure 9.

6. Conclusions

The potential of using nearby galaxies with resolved SFHs to constrain TP-AGB evolution
was demonstrated in our previous works (G10, R14), in which evolutionary parameters have been
changed in order to improve the agreement between the model predictions and the data. The present
work is intended to continue along this line with the addition of galaxies containing younger pop-
ulations, hence allowing us to calibrate the parameters of TP-AGB stars with larger initial masses
even into the regime of TP-AGB stars that experience HBB. We ﬁnd that the models produced by
R14 show good agreement in most cases, with a few exceptions. First, the NTP−AGB/NRGB ratio,
a proxy for the mean TP-AGB lifetimes, showed a mean fractional diﬀerence data to model of 9%
across the entire galaxy sample. Second, we compared predicted and observed LFs, a more complex
estimate of the TP-AGB lifetimes than the NTP−AGB/NRGB ratio. All but a few cases show consis-
tent agreement to within random SFH uncertainties. Finally, we compared the predicted TP-AGB
ﬂux to the observed and found signiﬁcant improvement compared to older TP-AGB models. The
few problematic cases we ﬁnd (KDG 73, UGCA 292) probably correspond to cases in which the
SFH was not as well measured due to the depth of the photometry and/or the large distance to
the galaxies.

We consider the present R14 models as satisfactory, and that the TP-AGB calibration process
needs new and independent data to proceed, aiming to an even more stringent level of agreement
between data and models.

The fact that the present models satisfactorily reproduce the numbers and LFs of the present
HST optical and NIR data does not necessarily mean that they will equally well reproduce data
in other passbands, even for the same galaxies. As discussed in R14, the present calibration
involved changes mainly in the mass-loss formula, as this was the largest parameter eﬀecting the
lifetime along the TP-AGB. There may be other ways of obtaining similar results via changes in
other processes as well, including dredge-up eﬃciency, the mixing length parameter, along with a
diﬀerent mass-loss formalisms. These alternative ways, however, would probably imply diﬀerent
results for the mid-infrared photometry, which we cannot test with the present observational data
for this sample.

A TP-AGB calibration following a multi-band and multi-parametric approach, applied simul-
taneously to many galaxies, is the clear path forward in understanding the physical properties of
large numbers of TP-AGB stars. This process will be pursued in forthcoming works by our team,
targeting more complete databases in the Magellanic Clouds and in M31, in addition to ANGST
galaxies.
