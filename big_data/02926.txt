Experimental investigation on the uniqueness of a

center of a body

Shigehiro Sakata

March 10, 2016

Abstract

The object of our investigation is a point that gives the maximum value of a potential with a
strictly decreasing radially symmetric kernel. It deﬁnes a center of a body in Rm. When we choose
α−m-center or an
the Riesz kernel or the Poisson kernel as the kernel, such centers are called an r
illuminating center, respectively.

The existence of a center is easily shown but the uniqueness does not always hold. Suﬃcient
conditions of the uniqueness of a center have been studied by some researchers. The main results in
this paper are some new suﬃcient conditions for the uniqueness of a center of a body.

Introduction

Let Ω be a body (the closure of a bounded open set) in Rm. We consider a potential of the form

KΩ(x) =ZΩ

k(r)dy, x ∈ Rm, r = |x − y| .

(1.1)

If the kernel k : (0, +∞) → R is strictly decreasing and satisﬁes the condition (C0
α) (which is detailed
in section 2), then the potential KΩ is continuous on Rm (Proposition 2.1) and has a maximum point
only in the convex hull of Ω (Proposition 2.2). We call a maximum point of KΩ a k-center of Ω in what
follows. The object of our investigation in this paper is a k-center of Ω.

Analytically, the study on k-centers is related to the investigation on the shape of a solution of a
partial diﬀerential equation. When the kernel k(r) is given by the Gauss kernel (4πt)−m/2 exp(−r2/(4t))
with a positive parameter t, we obtain the unique bounded solution of the Cauchy problem for the heat
equation with initial datum χΩ. A (spatial) maximum point of the solution of the heat equation is called
a hot spot. The existence, asymptotic behavior, uniqueness and location of a hot spot were well-studied,
for example, in [1, 2, 5, 10, 12]. When the kernel k(r) is given by the Poisson kernel h(r2 + h2)−(m+1)/2
with a positive parameter h, we obtain the Poisson integral for the upper half-space (up to a constant
multiple). The Poisson integral is a solution of the Laplace equation for the upper half-space. A maximum
point of the Poisson integral was studied in [18].

Geometrically, the study on k-centers is related to Moszy´nska’s radial center. In [13], she introduced

a radial center of a star body A induced by a function φ as a maximum point of the function

ΦA(x) =ZSm−1

φ (ρA−x(v)) dσ(v), x ∈ Ker A.

(1.2)

Here, ρA−x(v) = max{λ ≥ 0|λv + x ∈ A} is the radial function of A with respect to x, and Ker A = {p ∈
A|∀q ∈ A, pq ⊂ A} is the kernel of A. Her motivation for the study on radial centers comes from the

1

optimal position of the origin for the intersection body of a star body. Intersection bodies were introduced
by Lutwak in [11] to solve Busemann and Petty’s problem [4]. We refer to Moszy´nska’s text book [14,
pp. 185–201] for those historical backgrounds in convex geometry. The paper [7] is also a good reference
for the physical meaning of radial centers.

Using the polar coordinate, we rewrite the function ΦA(x) as

ΦA(x) =ZA

φ′(r)r1−mdy + φ(0)σ(cid:0)Sm−1(cid:1) , x ∈ Ker A, r = |x − y| .

(1.3)

When the kernel k(r) is given by the monomial rα−m, k-centers are well-studied.

Putting k(r) = φ′(r)r1−m, we obtain the potential KA. Since the potential KA is deﬁned on Rm even if
A is NOT star-shaped, we can understand that the notion of k-centers is an extension of radial centers.
In [13], when
φ(ρ) = ρα in (1.2), Moszy´nska called a maximum point of ΦA a radial center of order α and showed
that if 0 < α ≤ 1, then every convex body has a unique radial center of order α. In [8], for α > 1, the
uniqueness of a radial center of a convex body was studied but the argument included an error. In [9],
Herburt studied the location of a radial center of order 1. She showed that every smooth convex body
has a radial center of order 1 only in its interior. In [15], O’Hara investigated the potential

the rα−m-potential and deﬁned an rα−m-center of Ω as a maximum point
Ω . In other words, he extended the notion in [13] to a non-star-shaped case. He showed that if

He called the potential V (α)
of V (α)
α ≥ m + 1, then every body has a unique rα−m-center.
On the uniqueness of a k-center in [13, 15], the common idea is to show the strict concavity of the
potential KΩ on the convex hull of Ω (the location of k-centers). But, using Alexandrov’s reﬂection
principle or the moving plane method ([6, 19]), we can restrict a region containing all k-centers smaller
than the convex hull of Ω. We call such a small region the minimal unfolded region of Ω, denoted by
U f (Ω), which was introduced by O’Hara in [15]. When Ω is a convex body, in [2], the minimal unfolded
region was independently deﬁned by Brasco, Magnanini and Salani as the heart of Ω denoted by ♥(Ω).
Hence, in order to show the uniqueness of a k-center, it is suﬃcient to show the strict concavity of KΩ
on the minimal unfolded region.

The minimal unfolded region U f (Ω) is made by the following procedure: Fix a direction v ∈ Sm−1
and a parameter b ∈ R; Let Reﬂv,b denote the reﬂection of Rm in the hyperplane {z ∈ Rm|z · v = b};
By Ω+
v,b = {z ∈ Ω|z · v ≥ b}, we denote the set of all points in Ω whose height in the direction v are not
smaller than b; We repeat to fold the set Ω+
v,b by the reﬂection Reﬂv,b and to gradually decrease the value
b ∈ R until the image is stick out from Ω; Let l(v) be the minimum folding height for v, that is, put

For example, in R2, the minimal unfolded region of the union of the two same-sized discs

is the line segment {(y1, 0)| − 1 ≤ y1 ≤ 1}. Therefore, when we investigate the number of k-centers of
D1 ∪ D2, we should consider the graph of the function KD1∪D2 (λ, 0) for −1 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Then, for a given
concrete kernel, we can draw the graph of KD1∪D2(λ, 0) with the calculator Maple. In such a manner, we
give some examples of the graphs of rα−m-potentials. To be precise, we produce the following examples:

(1) The union of the two same-sized discs (1.7) has two r−1/2-centers.
(2) The set of r−1/2-centers of the annulus {(y1, y2)|1 ≤ y2
(3) The isosceles triangle {(y1, y2)|0 ≤ y1 ≤ 1, |y2| ≤ (tan(π/10))y1} has a unique r−1/2-center.
(4) The cone {(y1, y2, y3)|0 ≤ y1 ≤ 1, y2

center.

From the third example, we see that, in general, the rα−m-potential is not concave on the convex hull of
a body for 1 < α < m + 1. Hence it seems diﬃcult to give a suﬃcient condition for the uniqueness of an
rα−m-center for 1 < α < m + 1.

Our main result in this paper is a suﬃcient condition for the uniqueness of a k-center implying the
α) for some α > 1 (which is

examples (3) and (5). Precisely, if the kernel k satisﬁes the condition (C1
detailed in section 2), and if k′(r)/r is increasing, then the body of revolution

Ω =(cid:8)(y1, ¯y) ∈ R × Rm−1 |0 ≤ y1 ≤ 1, |¯y| ≤ ω (y1)} ,

where ω : [0, 1] → [0, +∞) is a piecewise C1 function with ωm−1 concave, has a unique k-center. This
result immediately implies the uniqueness of an rα−m-center of the body (1.8) for 1 < α < m + 1.
Furthermore, using the same manner as in the above result, we also show that a non-obtuse triangle in
R2 has a unique k-center if k′(r)/r is increasing. We remark that these results on the uniqueness of an
rα−m-center cannot follow from the power-concavity argument as in [1].

2.1 Properties of KΩ

Let us prepare some properties of our potential KΩ from [18] without those proofs.

Proposition 2.1 ([18, Propositions 2.3, 2.6, 4.1 and Corollary 4.2]). Let Ω be a body in Rm.

(1) If the kernel k satisﬁes the condition (C0

α) for some α > 0, then the potential KΩ is continuous on

Rm.

(2) If the kernel k satisﬁes the condition (C1

α) for some α > 1, then the potential KΩ is of class C1 on

Rm, and we have

(3) If Ω has a piecewise C1 boundary, and if the kernel k satisﬁes the condition (C1

then the potential KΩ is of class C2 on Rm \ ∂Ω, and we have

∂KΩ

(x) = −Z∂Ω

k(r)ej · n(y)dσ(y), x ∈ Rm \ ∂Ω,

where n is the outer unit normal vector ﬁeld of ∂Ω, and ej is the j-th unit vector of Rm.

Proposition 2.2 ([18, Proposition 3.2]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. Suppose that the kernel k is strictly
decreasing and satisﬁes the condition (C0
α) for some α > 0. The potential KΩ has a maximum point, and
any maximizer of KΩ belongs to the convex hull of Ω.

Deﬁnition 2.3 ([18, Deﬁnition 3.3]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. A point x is called a k-center of Ω if it
gives the maximum value of KΩ.

2.2 Properties of minimal unfolded regions

Let U f (Ω) be the minimal unfolded region of a body Ω as in (1.6). We introduce some properties of
the minimal unfolded region of Ω from [3, 2, 15, 18] with slight modiﬁcations in our case. (The studies
performed in [3] does not ask for the regularity of k but required the boundedness of k(r) at r = 0+.)
Geometric properties of the minimal unfolded region were also studied in [16].

Remark 2.4 ([15, p. 381]). Let Ω be a body in Rm.

(1) The centroid (the center of mass) of Ω is contained in U f (Ω). Hence U f (Ω) is not empty.

(2) U f (Ω) is contained in conv Ω but, in general, not contained in Ω.

(3) U f (Ω) is compact and convex.

Example 2.5 ([3, Lemma 5], [15, Example 3.4]).

(1) The minimal unfolded region of a non-obtuse tri-
angle is given by the polygon formed by the mid-perpendicular of edges and the bisectors of angles.
In particular, it is contained in the triangle formed by joining the middle points of the edges.

4

(2) The minimal unfolded region of an obtuse triangle is given by the polygon formed by the largest

edge, its mid-perpendicular and the bisectors of angles.

Proposition 2.6 ([18, Proposition 4.9]). Let Ω be a body in Rm. If k is strictly decreasing, then any
k-center of Ω belongs to U f (Ω).

We give a relation between a body Ω and its minimal unfolded region U f (Ω). The idea of the proof
is due to [3, Theorem 1]. To be precise, in [3], Brasco and Magnanini studied geometry of the minimal
unfolded region (heart) of a convex body, but their argument works for a non-convex body with slight
modiﬁcations.
Lemma 2.7. Let Ω be a body in Rm. The minimum folding height l : Sm−1 → R is lower semi-continuous.
Proof. We show that the set {v ∈ Sm−1|l(v) > b} is open in Sm−1 for any b ∈ R. Fix an arbitrary b ∈ R.
Let w ∈ Sm−1 be a direction with l(w) > b.
w,b)∩Ωc has an interior point. We take a point
x from the intersection. Since Ωc is open in Rm, there exists an ε1 > 0 such that the ε1-neighborhood
of x is contained in Ωc. Since Reﬂw,b(Ω+
w,b) is the closure of an open set, x is in its interior or in its
boundary. We only consider the latter case. We can choose a point x′ from the ε1-neighborhood of x
such that x′ ∈ (Reﬂw,b(Ω+
w,b))◦. There exists an ε2 > 0 such that the ε2-neighborhood of x′ is contained
in the interior of Reﬂw,b(Ω+
w,b)∩ Bε1 (x). Hence the ε2-neighborhood of x′ is contained in the intersection
Reﬂw,b(Ω+

We ﬁrst show that the non-empty intersection Reﬂw,b(Ω+

Next, we complete the proof. Let x be an interior point of Reﬂw,b(Ω+

w,b) ∩ Ωc, that is, x′ is an interior point of the intersection.
w,b) ∩ Ωc. Let ξ = Reﬂ−1

constant such that Bε(x) ⊂ Reﬂw,b(Ω+
contained in Ω+

w,b. The continuity of the map

w,b) ∩ Ωc, and ε be a positive
w,b(x), then the ε-neighborhood of ξ is

Sm−1 ∋ u 7→ Reﬂu,b(ξ) = ξ + 2(b − ξ · u)u ∈ Rm

implies the existence of a positive constant δ such that, for any u ∈ Bδ(w) ∩ Sm−1, the ball Bε/2(ξ) is
contained in Ω+

u,b, and we have

which completes the proof.

Reﬂu,b(cid:0)Bε/2(ξ)(cid:1) ⊂ Bε(x) ⊂ Ωc,

For a direction v ∈ Sm−1, we denote the orthogonal complement vector space by v⊥, that is, we let
(2.4)

v⊥ = { z ∈ Rm| z · v = 0} .

We understand that Ω is convex in a direction v if the intersection Ω∩ (Spanhvi + z) is connected for any
point z in v⊥.

Proposition 2.8. Let Ω be a body in Rm.
(1) If there exist p (1 ≤ p ≤ m) independent directions v1, . . . , vp ∈ Sm−1 such that Ω is symmetric in

p and convex in the directions v1, . . . , vp, then we have

the hyperplanes v⊥

1 , . . . , v⊥

(2) If the dimension of the minimal unfolded region of Ω is p (0 ≤ p ≤ m−1), then there exists a direction
w ∈ Sm−1 orthogonal to U f (Ω) such that Ω is symmetric in a hyperplane parallel to w⊥ and convex
in w.

5

Proof. (1) We remark that l(vj) = l(−vj) for any 1 ≤ j ≤ p. Let us show l(vj) = 0 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ p,
which implies

U f (Ω) ⊂

p

\j=1

({z ∈ Rm |z · vj ≤ l (vj)} ∩ {z ∈ Rm |z · (−vj) ≤ l (−vj)} ) =

\j=1

Suppose that we can choose a number j with l(vj) > 0. There exists a height b (0 < b < l(vj)) such

that Reﬂvj ,b(Ω+

vj ,b) ∩ Ωc 6= ∅. We can choose a point x ∈ Ω+

vj ,b such that x′ = Reﬂvj ,b(x) ∈ Ωc.

On the other hand, from the symmetry of Ω in the hyperplane v⊥

j , we have x′′ = Reﬂvj ,0(x) ∈ Ω. By

the convexity of Ω for vj, we have

∅ 6= xx′ ∩ Ωc ⊂ xx′′ ∩ Ωc ⊂ Ω ∩ Ωc = ∅,

which is a contradiction.

(2) Since U f (Ω) is compact and convex, we may assume that U f (Ω) is contained in the p-dimensional
vector space Rp × {0}m−p ⊂ Rp × Rm−p = Rm. By a translation of Rp × {0}m−p, we also may assume
that the centroid of U f (Ω), denoted by GΩ, coincides with the origin.
We ﬁrst show that the minimum value of l is zero. Suppose that l(v) is positive for any v ∈ Sm−1.

By the lower semi-continuity of l, we have

ρ = inf

v∈Sm−1

l(v) = min

v∈Sm−1

l(v) > 0.

Then the m-dimensional ball Bρ(0) is contained in U f (Ω), which is a contradiction. Hence there exists
a direction w ∈ Sm−1 such that l(w) = 0.
Ω is the union of Ω+
empty. Since Ω is a body, Ω \ (Ω+
we have

In order to show the symmetry of Ω with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to w, we show that
w,0)) is not

w,0). Suppose that the set minus Ω \ (Ω+

w,0))

y · wdy =ZΩ

y · wdy = Vol(Ω)GΩ · w = 0,

which is a contradiction. Hence Ω is symmetric in the hyperplane w⊥.

Finally, we show the convexity of Ω in the direction w. We assume the existence of two points x and
x′ in Ω such that the line segment xx′ is parallel to the vector space Spanhwi and contains a point ξ
in Ωc. We may assume (x + ξ) · w > 0. Let b = ((x + ξ) · w)/2. Then, we have ξ = Reﬂw,b(x), which
contradicts to l(w) = 0 < b.
Furthermore, the ﬁrst assertion implies that the direction w is orthogonal to the minimal unfolded

region of Ω.

3 Examples of the graphs

Let Ω be a body in Rm (m ≥ 2) with a piecewise C1 boundary. In this section, in order to investigate

4 Uniqueness of a k-center

Let Ω be a body in Rm. In this section, we investigate the uniqueness of a k-center of Ω. Put

For any a/2 ≤ λ ≤ (1 + b)/2, the ﬁrst and third terms are obviously negative. Therefore, it is suﬃcient
to show the negativity of the second integral.

We ﬁrst consider the case of a/2 ≤ λ ≤ a. We decompose the second integral into

Corollary 4.2. Let Ω and k be as in Theorem 4.1. Then Ω has a unique k-center.
Remark 4.3. When ω(t) = tp, the assumption “ωm−1 is concave” corresponds to 0 ≤ p ≤ 1/(m − 1).
Remark 4.4. In the proof of Theorem 4.1, in order to show the negativity of (∂2KΩ/∂x2
1)(λ, 0), we
decomposed the boundary integral expression of (∂2KΩ/∂x2
1)(λ, 0) into the three integrals over the left
base, the side and the right base. The integrals over the bases were obviously negative, and we showed
the negativity of the integral over the side.

Unfortunately, this argument does not work for any axially symmetric convex body Ω. When we
apply this argument to the cone as in Example 3.4, the boundary integral over the side is not negative
on the minimal unfolded region. In other words, in order to show the negativity of (∂2KΩ/∂x2
1)(λ, 0) for
any axially symmetric convex body Ω, we have to estimate the boundary integral over the bases in more
detail. We could not do it and leave the following problem as a conjecture:

Does an axially symmetric convex body Ω have a unique k-center? More generally, does a
convex body Ω have a unique k-center? We allow to assume some conditions for the kernel k
if necessary.

4.2 Uniqueness of a center of a non-obtuse triangle

Theorem 4.5. Let Ω be a non-obtuse triangle in R2. Suppose that the kernel k is strictly decreasing
satisﬁes the condition (C1
α) for some α > 1. If k′(r)/r is increasing on the interval (d(Ω), D(Ω)), then
the potential KΩ is strictly concave on the minimal unfolded region of Ω.
Proof. For an angle −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, let

Rθ =(cid:18) cos θ − sin θ

cos θ (cid:19) .

We show that the second derivative ∂2KRθ Ω/∂x2

Let O be origin, P the point (1, 0), and Q a point (a, b) with the following conditions:

By an orthogonal action of R2, we may assume that Ω is given by △OP Q. Let A, B and C be the middle
points of the line segments OP , P Q and QO, respectively. We remark that the minimal unfolded region
of Ω is contained in △ABC (see Example 2.5).
denote the point RθP by Pθ, for short, and so on.

We identify the notation zj for the j-th coordinate with the function zj : R2 ∋ (z1, z2) 7→ zj ∈ R. We
We have to consider the following eleven cases about the position of RθΩ (see Figure 9 to 19):

Case I The rotation angle θ is non-negative.

Case I.1 z1(Aθ) ≤ z1(Qθ) ≤ z1(Bθ).
Case I.2 z1(Qθ) ≤ z1(Aθ) ≤ z1(Bθ).
Case I.3.1 0 ≤ z1(Bθ) ≤ z1(Aθ) and the slope of the line PθQθ is non-positive.
Case I.3.2 0 ≤ z1(Bθ) ≤ z1(Aθ) and the slope of the line PθQθ is non-negative.
Case I.4.1 z1(Bθ) ≤ 0 ≤ z1(Aθ) and the slope of the line PθQθ is non-positive.
Case I.4.2 z1(Bθ) ≤ 0 ≤ z1(Aθ) and the slope of the line PθQθ is non-negative.

Case II The rotation angle θ is non-positive.

Case II.1 z1(Cθ) ≤ z1(Aθ).
Case II.2.1 z1(Aθ) ≤ z1(Cθ) ≤ z1(Pθ) and the slope of the line OQθ is non-negative.
Case II.2.2 z1(Aθ) ≤ z1(Cθ) ≤ z1(Pθ) and the slope of the line OQθ is non-positive.
Case II.3.1 z1(Pθ) ≤ z1(Cθ) and the slope of the line OQθ is non-negative.
Case II.3.2 z1(Pθ) ≤ z1(Cθ) and the slope of the line OQθ is non-positive.

We show the negativity of

Zθ = (2x1 − z1 (Qθ) , slope (OQθ) (2x1 − z1 (Qθ))) .

Remark 4.7. In the proof of Theorem 4.5, we showed the concavity of the potential KΩ on the triangle
△ABC. Since the minimal unfolded region is contained in the triangle, we obtained the conclusion.
Unfortunately, this argument does not work for any obtuse triangle (except isosceles triangles). This
is because the minimal unfolded region of an obtuse triangle is not contained in the triangle whose vertices
are the middle points of the edges (see Example 2.5).

The function AΩ(x, h) has a geometric meaning as below: Let x ∈ Rm and h > 0; Deﬁne the map
p(x,h) : Ω → Sm by

The solid angle of Ω at (x, h) is deﬁned as the spherical Lebesgue measure of the image p(x,h)(Ω); Direct
calculation shows that AΩ(x, h) coincides with the solid angle of Ω at (x, h). In other words, the function
AΩ(x, h) gives the “visibility” of Ω at the point (x, h).

˜D(Ω) is a slight improvement of D(Ω), then Ω has a unique illuminating center.

On the other hand, in [20], the function AΩ(x, h) was introduced by Katsuyuki Shibata to give an
answer for PISA’s problem “Where should we put a streetlight in a triangular park?”. Shibata called a
maximizer of AΩ(·, h) an illuminating center of Ω of height h.

a unique illuminating center.

Proposition 5.8. Let Ω be as in Theorem 4.1 or 4.5. For any h > 0, Ω has a unique illuminating center.

Proof. Direct computation shows that the kernel of AΩ satisﬁes the assumption as in Theorem 4.1 or 4.5
for any h.

Remark 5.9. Let us remark the value of Proposition 5.8. We newly proved the uniqueness of an
illuminating center without the assumption of h when Ω cannot be obtained as any parallel body like as
Example 3.3 or Example 3.5.
