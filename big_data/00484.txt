ABSTRACT

A global evolution picture of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is key to understanding almost every
aspect of planet formation, where standard alpha-disk models have been constantly employed for its
simplicity. In the mean time, disk mass loss has been conventionally attributed to photoevaporation
which controls disk dispersal. However, a paradigm shift towards accretion driven by magnetized disk
winds has been realized in the recent years, thanks to studies of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic
eﬀects in PPDs. I present a framework of global PPD evolution aiming to incorporate these advances,
highlighting the role of wind-driven accretion and wind mass loss. Disk evolution is found to be
largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and viscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of
disk evolution is controlled primarily by the amount of external magnetic ﬂux threading the disks,
and how rapidly the disk loses the ﬂux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the disk is able to
hold most of its magnetic ﬂux during the evolution. In addition, because wind launching requires
suﬃcient level of ionization at disk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is
also aﬀected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk lifetime of a few Myrs,
the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass through the wind as through accretion onto the
protostar, and most of the wind mass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional
wind mass loss increases with increasing disk lifetime. Signiﬁcant wind mass loss likely substantially
enhances the dust to gas mass ratio, and promotes planet formation.

1. INTRODUCTION

Global evolution of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is
governed by the processes of angular momentum trans-
port and outﬂow mass loss. These processes directly con-
trol disk structure and evolution, which set the timescales
of disk dispersal and hence planet formation (e.g., see
Armitage 2011; Turner et al. 2014 and Alexander et al.
2014 for reviews). They also strongly aﬀect the evolution
of dust grains, which are building blocks of planets, and
feedback to disk thermal and chemical structures (e.g.,
see Testi et al. 2014 and Henning & Semenov 2013 for
reviews). If planets are formed within the disk lifetime,
planet-disk interaction leads to planet migration, which
is also sensitive to global disk structure and evolution
(e.g., see Baruteau et al. 2014 for a review).
In brief,
a reliable global evolutionary picture of PPD is key to
understanding most processes of planet formation.

Most PPD models used in planet formation re-
search are
constructed upon the viscous α disk
model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), where the underly-
ing assumption is that the disk is turbulent presum-
ably due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI,
Balbus & Hawley 1991). However, the extremely weak
level of ionization introduces strong non-ideal magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) eﬀects that suppress or damp the
MRI in most regions in PPDs, while pure hydrodynamic
mechanisms appear unable to provide suﬃciently level
of turbulent viscosity (e.g., Turner et al. 2014). Angu-
lar momentum transport in PPDs is thus most likely
governed by magnetized disk winds, as demonstrated

xbai@cfa.harvard.edu

in disk simulations that properly taking into account
these non-ideal MHD eﬀects (e.g., Bai & Stone 2013b;
Bai 2013, 2014, 2015; Lesur et al. 2014; Gressel et al.
2015; Simon et al. 2015).
In the mean time, the MRI
may operate in the surface layer of the outer disk, ow-
ing to strong far-UV (FUV) ionization at disk surface
(Perez-Becker & Chiang 2011), which can lead to vig-
orous turbulence and mediate a certain level of viscous
transport of angular momentum (Simon et al. 2013b,a;
Bai 2015).

We note that in the conventional studies of MHD
winds, wind launching generally requires near equiparti-
tion ﬁeld at the disk midplane (e.g., Ferreira & Pelletier
1995). As a result, the disk surface density must be very
low to be consistent the observed disk accretion rates
(e.g., Combet & Ferreira 2008, otherwise, accretion rate
would become too high), making the disk wind scenario
less appealing to account for the mass content of gas and
dust in PPDs. On the other hand, in the aforementioned
more realistic simulations, winds are launched from sev-
eral scale heights above midplane, because the midplane
region is too weakly ionized for suﬃcient coupling be-
tween the gas and magnetic ﬁelds. With much weaker
ﬁeld (magnetic pressure much less than midplane gas
pressure) permitted for wind launching, the new scenario
simultaneously accounts for the accretion rates and mass
budget from observations.

The paradigm shift towards wind-driven PPD evolu-
tion calls for a model framework in replacement of α-
disk models. The aforementioned simulations are all lo-
cal in vertical extent, and hence are unable to provide
reliable estimates of wind kinematics. An initial study

2

X.-N. Bai

by Armitage et al. (2013) took the ﬁtting relations of vis-
cous stress and wind torque from Simon et al. (2013a)’s
outer disk simulations and found slow disk evolution fol-
lowed by rapid dispersal. Disk mass loss was not included
in their study. A more reliable disk evolution framework
would require better determination of the wind torque
and wind mass loss rate, and their dependence on phys-
ical parameters.

Recently, Bai et al. (2016) (hereafter B16) proposed a
physically motivated, semi-analytical 1D model of PPD
disk winds with global treatment of wind kinematics.
The model further takes into account thermodynamical
eﬀects and uniﬁes the classical (cold) MHD disk wind
with photoevaporation. Despite remaining uncertainties
explicitly discussed there, it now becomes possible to in-
corporate the key results into a framework of global wind-
driven PPD evolution, and explore in parallel the role
played by magnetic ﬁelds and thermodynamics. This is
the goal of this paper.

We describe our formalism and methodology in Section
2. In Section 3, we discuss the general angular momen-
tum transport and mass loss processes without evolving
the disk, and study parameter dependence. Disk evolu-
tionary properties are studied in Section 4. We extend
our model to discuss additional eﬀects including level of
disk ﬂaring and X-ray heating in Section 5. Implications
and limitations of our study are discussed in Section 6.
We summarize and conclude in Section 7.

2. A SIMPLIFIED MODEL FOR WIND-DRIVEN PPD

EVOLUTION

We construct a 1 D disk model on the evolution of the
disk surface density Σ(R) as a function of disk cylindri-
cal radius R in the presence of turbulence, wind torque
and mass loss (Section 2.1). In the mean time, we adopt
a simple treatment of disk vertical structure to estimate
the vertical location za where external far-UV (FUV) ra-
diation can penetrate, and zb (≥ za) where the wind is
launched (wind base), based on which we calculate the
transport properties (Section 2.2). Hence, our model can
be considered as 1+1 D. We discuss calculation proce-
dures and model parameters in Section 2.3.

2.1. Disk Evolutionary Equations

We begin by writing down the equations governing the
surface density evolution, incorporating the eﬀects of vis-
˙Macc(R) be the
cosity, wind torque and mass loss. Let
net accretion rate at cylindrical radius R. We adopt the
˙Macc is positive for net accre-
sign convention such that
tion. Let ˙Mloss(R) be the cumulative wind mass loss rate
enclosed within radius R. We will always use its diﬀer-
ential form

˙Mloss(R) ≡ Z R

Ri

∂ ˙Mloss

∂R

dR′ ,

(1)

where Ri is the radius of the disk inner edge beyond
which the wind is launched.

The bulk of PPDs is cold, and unless unrealistically
strongly magnetized, rotation is largely Keplerian, with
speciﬁc angular momentum jK (R) = vKR = ΩKR2,
where vK , ΩK are the Keplerian speed and corresponding
angular frequency. Let ˙Jr(R) be the vertically integrated

total radial angular momentum ﬂux. It is given by

˙Jr = − ˙Macc(R)jK(R) + Wr(R) ,

where

accounts for angular momentum ﬂux generated from in-
ternal stresses, including Reynolds stress, Maxwell stress,
and potentially stress from disk self-gravity (not included
above) in the case of a massive disk that is gravitation-
ally unstable, with overline representing averaging over
the local volume. Here, we follow the α convention, with
cs being disk sound speed. Note that α can be posi-
tion dependent, and we use ˜α to represent an eﬀective,
(density-weighted) vertically-averaged value.

Let ˙Jw(R) be the total vertical angular momentum ﬂux
extracted from the disk (by the MHD wind) enclosed
within radius R. We only use its diﬀerential form:

and λ is called the wind lever arm (dimensionless). For
wind launched from radius R0, the physical meaning
of λ(R0) is that it is the ratio of speciﬁc angular mo-
menta in the wind ﬂow and in the Keplerian disk at
R = R0, and it is related to wind Alfv´en radius RA
by λ ≡ (RA/R0)2 > 1. The ∂Ww/∂R term repre-
sents the excess angular momentum extracted from the
disk, related to the wind torque. In the above, we have
dropped the hydrodynamic term in the deﬁnition of Ww,
which corresponds to the standard deﬁnition of the wind
base zb (Wardle & Koenigl 1993): at the wind base,
vφ(zb) = vK.

This is the master equation that we will solve to study
global disk evolution.1 It clearly generalizes the viscous
evolution equation to include wind-driven accretion and
mass loss terms (the 2nd and 3rd terms on the right
hand side). To evaluate these terms, we must determine
˜α, λ and ∂ ˙Mloss/∂R at each radius, as we do in the next
subsection.

2.2. The Model for Disk Structure, Angular Momentum

Transport, and Mass Loss

We follow and extend the work of B16 and construct
the vertical dimension of our wind model to calculate
wind properties, and the basic picture is illustrated in
Figure 1.

We assume that the disk follows a two-temperature
proﬁle with T = Td in the disk interior and T = Ta
at disk surface (atmosphere), and transitions at verti-
cal height z = za. Both layers are treated as vertically
isothermal. Disk temperature Td is largely determined
by stellar irradiation. We use a power-law temperature
proﬁle similar to the standard minimum-mass solar nebu-
lar (MMSN) model (Weidenschilling 1977; Hayashi 1981)
with

Td = 280 K RAU

−sT ,

(10)

where RAU is radius measured in AU, and sT is the power
law index. By default, we take sT = 1/2, as in the
MMSN model. The corresponding disk isothermal sound
speed cs,d and disk scale height Hd satisfy cs,d/vK =
(Hd/R) ≈ 0.034R1/4
AU. With Hd/R increasing with R,
the disk is ﬂared, as is well known from SED modeling
of T Tauri disks (Chiang & Goldreich 1997).

Disk surface (atmosphere) temperature is largely de-
termined strong heating from stellar far-UV (FUV) ra-
diation and X-rays. For simplicity, we assume it is a
constant factor higher than disk temperature

Ta = f Td ,

(11)

and hence atmosphere sound speed cs,a = √f cs,d.
In
practice, we take f = 3 − 8 in our calculations, con-
sistent with typical results from more detailed thermo-
chemical calculation (e.g., Walsh et al. 2010), as well
as observational constraints from the HD 163296 disk
(Rosenfeld et al. 2013).

In the mean time, FUV is capable of fully ionizing
carbon and sulfur species, leading to an ionization frac-
tion ∼ 10−5−4, and gas and magnetic ﬁelds become well
coupled in the FUV layer (Perez-Becker & Chiang 2011).
We note that X-rays alone generally produces much lower

1 Note that the term involving α is a factor 2/3 of that in a vis-
cous evolution equation. This is because we directly parameterize
α from the Rφ component of the stress tensor TRφ (the terms in
the parenthesis in Equation (3)), whereas assuming Navier-Stokes
viscosity ν, TRφ involves dΩ/dR which yields an extra factor of
3/2.

Fig. 1.— Cartoon illustration of our global PPD evolution model.
The bulk of the disk is cold (thin), where magnetic ﬁelds are poorly
coupled to the gas with very weak level of turbulence. The surface
layer is much warmer and much better ionized due to strong exter-
nal far-UV/X-ray heating/ionization, and the gas is well coupled
to magnetic ﬁelds, enabling MHD wind launching. The cold-warm
interface is marked by za, and we use zb to denote the wind base
where the wind is launched. In general, zb ≈ za unless net vertical
magnetic ﬁeld is not suﬃciently strong.
In this case, the warm
surface layer can become MRI active (achieved at the outer disk),
and zb > za, sandwiching a warm MRI layer. Not reﬂected in this
cartoon picture is that the disk is ﬂared, making FUV radiation
easier to penetrate into the outer disk.

level of ionization in the surface layer (e.g., cf. Figure 1
of Bai 2011). Launching of MHD winds requires suf-
ﬁcient coupling between gas and magnetic ﬁelds, and
hence it mainly relies upon FUV ionization. Let ΣFUV
be the characteristic penetration depth of FUV photons.
Its value is uncertain and depends on the FUV luminos-
ity from the protostar, as well as the abundance of very
small grains. Here we adopt the calculation results by
Perez-Becker & Chiang (2011), quoting

ΣFUV = 0.01 − 0.1 g cm−2 ,

(12)

and treat it as a constant at all radii. The location of
the FUV front is determined by tracing radial rays from
the central star, until the column density traversed by
the rays equals to ΣFUV (see Section 2.2.4 for details).

By default, we assume that the penetration depth of
FUV and X-rays are comparable so that za is determined
by ΣFUV. In other words, we assume the rapid increase
of temperature at z = za is accompanied by a transition
into ideal MHD regime at disk surface.
In reality, X-
rays may be able to provide heating into deeper layers.
This will be discussed in Section 5.2, where we relax this
assumption.

Another important location is the wind base zb, from
which the wind is launched. The wind model of B16
assumed zb = za motivated by numerical simulations
of the inner disk (Bai & Stone 2013b; Gressel et al.
2015). Towards the outer disk, however, FUV can ef-
fectively penetrate deeper into the disk (in terms of
za/Hd) as the disk is ﬂared, and this can make the sur-
face layer subject to the MRI (Perez-Becker & Chiang
2011). A disk wind can also be launched from the sur-
face MRI turbulent layer in the presence of net verti-
cal ﬁeld (Suzuki & Inutsuka 2009; Fromang et al. 2013;
Bai & Stone 2013a; Suzuki & Inutsuka 2014), and local
simulations applicable to the outer PPDs found evidence
that disk outﬂow is launched from a higher position than
the FUV front (Simon et al. 2013a). We describe a pre-
scription in Section 2.2.4 to approximately determine the
location of zb > za in this case, and treat the layer

4

X.-N. Bai

za < z < zb as being MRI active. We apply the B16
model in the wind zone at z > zb, from which we esti-
mate the wind mass loss rate and wind torque. Although
the B16 model was constructed assuming laminar ﬂows
and does not strictly apply to estimate the wind kinemat-
ics of outﬂows launched from a turbulent surface, we as-
sume that it can still provide a reasonable approximation
in terms of wind mass loss rate and angular momentum
transport.

Below, we ﬁrst construct the wind model assuming the
locations of za and zb are known, then we iteratively
determine their locations.

2.2.1. Choice of the B16 Wind Model Parameters

The B16 wind model is constructed from the wind base
zb. Being a wind model that takes into account both
magnetic and thermal eﬀects, the most important param-
eters are the net vertical magnetic ﬁeld strength Bz(R)
threading the disk and wind/atmosphere temperature Ta
(or the atmosphere sound speed cs,a). We treat them as
our main physical parameters, and they correspond to
Bp0 and cs,w deﬁned in the B16 model.

We will discuss our choice of Bz(R) in Section 2.2.3.
Concerning wind temperature Ta, characterized by the
f factor in (11), we apply an additional constraint such
that the ratio of surface sound speed to Keplerian ve-
locity cs,a/vK ≤ 0.2. The B16 model tends to be less
reliable at higher temperature because the slow magne-
tosonic point is generally located below the wind base,
violating the assumptions made there. However, we ex-
pect this compromise to have only minor impact in our
calculations. As discussed in B16 (see their Figure 12),
wind kinematics is not very sensitive to wind tempera-
ture, which we also conﬁrm in our global disk calculations
in Section 3.2.3.

We ﬁx other parameters considered in B16 at their
ﬁducial values, where it was found that the wind so-
lutions are generally not sensitive to these parameters.
In particular, wind properties are not very sensitive to
the ﬁeld inclination angle θ because the wind is warm.
We thus choose representative ﬁeld geometry parameters
θ = 45◦. We also choose the ﬁeld divergence parameter
to be q = 0.25.2 We refer to Section 2 of B16 for further
model details.

2.2.2. Vertical Density Proﬁle

At each radius R, the disk zone at z < za satisﬁes
hydrostatic equilibrium, and gas density proﬁle ρ within
the disk is simply

ρ(R, z) = ρm(R) exp(cid:20) −

z2

2Hd(R)2(cid:21) (z < zb)

(13)

where ρm is midplane gas density. At the location z = za,
pressure balance requires a density jump between the
disk side and the atmosphere side
Td = ρ|z=z+

ρ|z=z−

Ta ,

(14)

2 This parameter characterizes how rapidly ﬁeld strength ap-
proaches the Bp ∝ R−2 scaling (see Equation 2 of B16 for deﬁni-
tion), and the wind solutions do show relatively strong dependence
on q. We choose the ﬁducial number q = 0.25 to avoid more ex-
treme cases (i.e., diverging from launching point with q = ∞ and
ﬁeld lines being parallel to large distances).

a

. While this jump should occur
and we deﬁne ρa ≡ ρ|z=z+
more smoothly in reality where temperature transition is
more smooth, the resulting uncertainty can be absorbed
into ΣFUV. Between za ≤ z ≤ zb, another hydrostatic
equilibrium is maintained as
z2 − z2
ρ(R, z) = ρa(R) exp(cid:20) −
2Ha(R)2(cid:21) (za ≤ z ≤ zb) ,
where Ha = pTa/TdHd is the scale height of the disk

atmosphere. Typically, the wind base is located at sev-
eral disk scale heights above midplane, and regions with
z < zb encloses most of the disk mass. Thus, midplane
density ρm can be determined from surface density Σ
once za is known.

(15)

a

For the purpose of locating the wind base (see Section
2.2.4), we also need the density proﬁle in the vicinity of
the wind base so as to calculate the column densities for
FUV ray tracing. Due to magnetic forces, it can deviate
substantially from hydrostatic equilibrium. From Figure
3 of B16, we see that at ﬁxed wind temperature cs,w =
0.1vK, the wind density proﬁle is almost independent of
wind magnetization up to a substantial distance (∼ 2
times wind launching radius) from the wind base. We
have also veriﬁed this trend with other choices of wind
temperature. For wind launched from radius R0, we ﬁnd
a reasonable ﬁtting formula for gas density proﬁle along
the wind streamline

ρ(R) ≈ ρb(R0) exp(cid:20) −(cid:18) cs,a

vK (cid:19)−0.6r R

R0 − 1(cid:21) ,

(16)

where ρb is gas density at the wind base from (15), and
R is cylindrical radius along the wind streamline. This
formula is accurate to within order unity (most cases
within ∼ 20%) up to R = 2R0 for wind temperature
range cs,a/vK = 0.05 − 0.3. Because this density proﬁle
is solely used for ﬁnding the wind base location, we may
convert it into a vertical density proﬁle at radius R0 and
z > zb for convenience

ρ(R0, z) = ρb(R0) exp(cid:20) −(cid:18) cs,a

vK (cid:19)−0.6r z − zb

R0 (cid:21) , (17)

because FUV photons penetrate through approximately
the same column density in these two cases to reach the
next wind streamline.

2.2.3. Magnetic Flux Distribution and Evolution

Net vertical ﬁeld strength threading the disk Bz is as-
sociated with the poloidal ﬁeld at the wind base Bp0 by
Bz ≈ Bp0 cos θ, where we ﬁx inclination angle θ = 45◦.
It is then reﬂected in the wind base Alfv´en speed vA0 =
Bp0/√4πρb, a crucial parameter in the B16 wind model.
The radial proﬁle of Bz(R), and its time evolution,
however, are largely unconstrained. Attempts to study
magnetic ﬂux transport so far have not considered ef-
fects other than viscosity and Ohmic resistivity, nor
on the eﬀect of wind-driven accretion (Lubow et al.
1994; Okuzumi et al. 2014; Takeuchi & Okuzumi 2014;
Guilet & Ogilvie 2014).3 We here simply consider a phe-
nomenological approach, as adopted in Armitage et al.

3 Guilet & Ogilvie (2012) considered the eﬀect of disk outﬂow

(2013), and assume that magnetic ﬂux is distributed in
such a way that midplane plasma β of the net vertical
ﬁeld,

total magnetic ﬂux ΦB = 2πR Ro

We further consider two scenarios on the evolution of
In the
ﬁrst scenario, we assume ΦB is conserved during disk
evolution. Therefore, as accretion proceeds, disk be-
comes more strongly magnetized.
In the second sce-
nario, we assume that the disk loses magnetic ﬂux in
a way such that ΦB is proportional to total disk mass
Σ(R)RdR. This treatment avoids signiﬁ-
cant accumulation of magnetic ﬂux and results in slower
evolution.

Md = 2πR Ro

Ri

It is conceivable that magnetic ﬂux evolution can have
major impact on global disk structure and evolution,
and our phenomenological treatment bares signiﬁcant
uncertainties. For instance, it has been found that the
MRI can concentrate vertical magnetic ﬂux into ring-like
structures (Steinacker & Papaloizou 2002; Bai & Stone
2014), accompanied by radial pressure variations known
as zonal ﬂows (Johansen et al. 2009a). HL Tau like struc-
tures (ALMA Partnership 2015) may simply be a man-
ifestation of such zonal ﬂows. Before a more reliable
theory of magnetic ﬂux transport is available, we mainly
discuss the general features of wind-driven disk evolution
without focusing on the details in the evolution of surface
density proﬁles, and explore the general role played by
macroscopic parameters such as total magnetic ﬂux and
FUV penetration depth so as to better understand the
interplay between magnetic and thermal eﬀects on disk
evolution and dispersal.

2.2.4. Determining za and zb

Once the vertical density proﬁle is obtained from our
1+1D calculation, we trace radial rays from the ori-
gin (stellar location) with diﬀerent inclination angles θ
(w.r.t. disk midplane) to calculate the column density
Σc(R, z = R tan θ) traversed by these rays. The loca-
tion of the FUV ionization front za is determined by
Σc(R, za) = ΣFUV. While this simple ray-tracing pro-
cedure ignores important eﬀects of scattering and self-
shielding (Bethell & Bergin 2011), particularly on the
Lyman-α photons, which dominates FUV luminosities
(Herczeg et al. 2004), we again expect the uncertainties
can be absorbed into the value of ΣFUV, as a ﬁrst ap-
proximation.

Additionally, knowing the net vertical ﬁeld strength
Bz, we can estimate the plasma β of the net vertical ﬁeld
at z = za: β0(za) = 8πρac2
z . We note that in the
ideal MHD regime, the most unstable MRI wavelength
is given by (e.g., Hawley et al. 1995)

s,a/B2

λm
Ha ≈ 9.18β−1/2

0

.

(19)

Due to the rapid density density drop with height, we
expect the MRI to be able to eﬀectively operate when
λm . Ha. In practice, we assume that the disk surface
becomes MRI turbulent when β0(za) > 50. Otherwise,
we directly set zb = za.

If β0(za) > 50, we would expect the wind to be
launched from higher location from the MRI turbu-
lent layer. We further follow the density proﬁle using
(15) and determine the wind base location zb by setting
β0(zb) = 50. This treatment is by no means rigorous, yet
without better knowledge of the wind launching process
from turbulent disk surfaces and its global kinematics,
we expect it to be a reasonable ﬁrst approximation. Lo-
cal simulations of Simon et al. (2013a) lend support to
this treatment in that following a generalized (yet un-
proved) procedure to determine zb, they found that zb
is located above the FUV ionization front, and becomes
higher when net vertical ﬁeld is weaker. We also note
that in their simulations where the disk becomes largely
laminar (AD30AU1e3 and AD30AU1e4L), β0 at the wind
base is about 35 and 60, which are in rough agreement
with our choice of threshold β0 = 50.

The procedures above to determine za and zb can be
iterated with the vertical density proﬁle calculations de-
scribed in Section 2.2.2. Note that iteration only needs
to be done at the beginning to establish the initial condi-
tion, where convergence can be achieved to within 0.1%
typically within 3-4 iterations. The subsequent disk evo-
lution is suﬃciently slow that no iteration is necessary.

2.2.5. Eﬀective Viscosity

Pure hydrodynamic instabilities, such as the verti-
cal shear instability (Nelson et al. 2013; Stoll & Kley
2014),
convective overstability and baroclinic vor-
tex ampliﬁcation(Klahr & Hubbard 2014; Lyra 2014;
Raettig et al. 2013), and the zombie vortex instability
(Marcus et al. 2014), may operate in certain regions of
PPDs largely depending on disk thermodynamics.
In
general, these instabilities are found to produce very lim-
ited viscous transport with α < 10−3. In this work, we
adopt α = α0 = 2 × 10−4 at locations z < za to repre-
sent residual “viscosity” from such hydrodynamic insta-
bilities. As we shall see, because of the dominant role
played by disk winds, the exact value of α0 adopted here
is unimportant.

If an MRI active zone is present, we set α = α1 = 0.2
in this region (za < z < zb). We choose a relatively
large α because the net vertical ﬁeld at this surface layer
is eﬀectively strong (with β0 of the order 100), and it
is well known from MRI simulations (e.g., Hawley et al.
1995) that the resulting α is larger than zero net ﬂux
case and is of the order 0.1 or higher.

Additionally, while transport by the MRI is suppressed
or strongly damped by non-ideal MHD eﬀects at z < za,
there is still Maxwell stress resulting from either weak
MRI turbulence or large-scale ﬁelds in the outer disk,
and its strength increases with net vertical magnetic ﬂux.
Incorporating all these considerations, we adopt the fol-
lowing form of α in the disk zone at z < za:

αd = Min[Max(5.0β−1

0 , α0), α1] ,

(20)

in their local model though it was treated in the limit Bφ ≪ Bz
at disk surface. We expect PPD wind to lie in the opposite limit.

where the dependence on midplane β0 approximately re-
ﬂects the stress level found from local simulations of lay-

6

X.-N. Bai

ered accretion in the presence of net vertical ﬁeld (e.g.,
Okuzumi & Hirose 2011; Simon et al. 2013a; Bai 2015).
4 This way, the αd value ranges from α0 for the weak ﬁeld
case to α1 for the strong ﬁeld case which joins the α value
in the surface MRI active zone. Although this prescrip-
tion is motivated by the outer PPD gas dynamics, we
simply apply it to the entire disk, allowing α to increase
with net Bz. Towards the inner disk where the Hall
eﬀect is important, this treatment also roughly reﬂects
the fact that the large-scale stress (magnetic braking) re-
sulting from the Hall-shear instability increases with net
vertical ﬂux (Lesur et al. 2014; Bai 2014).5 We further
comment that the overall disk evolution is insensitive to
the exact prescription of α values because, as we will see,
disk evolution is largely wind-driven.

We apply the α values in the disk and surface regions
discussed above to Equation (3), from which an eﬀective
value, ˜α, can be determined. Note that we quote the ˜α
value based on sound speed in the disk interior cs,d.

2.2.6. Wind Mass Loss Rate and Lever Arm

Knowing the poloidal Alfv´en speed and sound speed
vA0 and cs,a at the wind base, we ﬁt the numerical results
presented in B16 to evaluate λ and ∂ ˙Mloss/∂R as needed
to evolve the master equation (9).

The wind mass loss rate is characterized by the dimen-
sionless mass loading parameter µ given by (see Equation
21 of B16)

d ˙Mloss
dR ≈ µ

ρbv2

A0 =

(21)

The wind is considered to be heavily loaded when µ & 1.
Figure 5 of B16 shows the dependence of µ on vA0 for
three diﬀerent wind temperatures, which we ﬁnd can be
well ﬁtted by

,

vK (cid:19)−1.48+0.17 log10(cs,a/vK )−0.1 log10(vA0/vK )
µ = µ0(cid:18) vA0
(22)
where µ0 = 0.5(cs,a/vK)− 0.015. We have also examined
additional wind solutions and conﬁrm that this ﬁtting
formula is accurate as long as cs,a/vK & 0.033 (note that
it becomes unphysical if cs,a/vK ≤ 0.03). For all models
considered in this work, the disk surface is suﬃciently
warm and satisﬁes this condition.

The magnetic lever arm λ is deﬁned as λ = (RA/R0)2,
where R0 is the wind launching radius and RA is the
Alfv´en radius. As shown in Figure 7 of B16, RA/R0
follows a well deﬁned relation with µ. The relation is in-
dependent of wind temperature when the wind is lightly
loaded (µ ≪ 1), and is largely parallel to the correspond-
ing relation in the Weber & Davis (1967) wind. With
these considerations, we obtain a reasonable ﬁtting rela-

4 Dependence of α on β0 is shallower in fully MRI turbulent

disks (Sorathia et al. 2010; Gressel & Pessah 2015).

5 With caveats that the stress level strongly depends on grain
abundance (Xu & Bai 2016), and it only applies when the back-
ground vertical ﬁeld is aligned with disk rotation. Nevertheless, in
our case wind is always the dominant driving mechanism of angu-
lar momentum transport in the inner disk, and the details of the
viscosity prescription does not aﬀect the overall disk evolution.

R0 ≈ p1.5[1 + (0.2µ)−2/3]

[1 + (0.2µ)1/4(cs,a/vK)2]2

(23)

We ﬁnd this ﬁtting relation is accurate for µ up to 100
for the range of cs,a/vK considered in this work (≤ 0.2).
Note that this ﬁtting relation becomes invalid and would
predict RA/R0 < 1 for very large µ and when the wind
is warm.
In reality, the wind would transition into a
pure thermally driven towards higher temperature, and
no longer extracts disk angular momentum. Note that
the results presented in B16 all have µ < 100, partly be-
cause a wind that is too heavily loaded generally violates
the assumptions made there (e.g., the slow magnetosonic
point is located below the wind base). In practice, be-
cause we have imposed the condition β0 ≤ 50 at the
wind base (relatively strong ﬁeld), we never encounter a
situation with µ > 100.

2.3. Calculation Procedures and Model Parameters

As a ﬁducial example and initial condition for our cal-
culations, we consider a disk model with a power-law
radial proﬁle and an exponential cutoﬀ motivated from
sub-millimeter observations (Andrews et al. 2009, 2010)

Σ0(R) = 500 g cm−2R−1

AU · exp (−R/Rd) ,

(24)

where RAU is radius measured in AU. We choose the
cutoﬀ radius to be Rd = 100 AU throughout this work.
The total disk mass is about 0.035 MJ.

Our calculations are carried out on a logarithmic grid
with inner boundary at Ri = 0.1 AU, and outer boundary
at Ro = 1000 AU using 200 grid points. Although the
disk-magnetosphere boundary likely lies further in, we
choose Ri = 0.1 AU because the innermost disk region
(. 0.1− 0.3 AU) is suﬃciently hot for thermal ionization
of Alkali species and is expected to be fully turbulent due
to the MRI (e.g., Desch & Turner 2015). The dynamics
in this region is complex and is very sensitive to disk ther-
modynamics (e.g., Faure et al. 2014; Hirose 2015), yet a
comprehensive picture has not been established (espe-
cially with the addition of MHD disk winds). We do not
attempt to model the dynamics of this region, but we
also point out that this region contains only a very small
fraction of total disk mass and should not aﬀect the bulk
of disk evolution.

The viscous term in Equation (9) is integrated with
standard zero torque boundary conditions. The wind-
driven accretion (advection) term is integrated using the
standard upwind method. We set Σmin = 10−4 g cm−2
as a ﬂoor of surface density.

Our model mainly consists of three sets of parameters.
First, magnetic ﬂux distribution and evolution. We
consider three diﬀerent values initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength, corresponding to plasma β of the net vertical
ﬁeld at midplane β0(z = 0) = 103, 104, 105 and 106, with
β0 = 105 as ﬁducial value. In each case, we evolve the
magnetic ﬂux either assuming ﬂux conservation ΦB =
const, or assuming ΦB ∝ Md.
Second, FUV penetration depth. We consider ΣFUV =
0.01 g cm−1 and 0.1 g cm−1, taking the former as ﬁducial.
Third, disk atmosphere temperature. We consider two
values of f = 3 or f = 8, with the former as ﬁducial (see
Equation (11)).

Global Evolution of PPDs

We will discuss in Section 5 further extensions of our
model, discussing the eﬀect of X-ray heating and the level
of disk ﬂaring.

3. TRANSPORT PROPERTIES IN A STATIC DISK

We begin by discussing the general features without
evolving the disk. We draw the disk surface density pro-
ﬁle from (24) and follow the procedures outlined above to
calculate the main diagnostic quantities related to disk
angular momentum transport and mass loss.

3.1. The Fiducial Model

We ﬁrst discuss the results from our ﬁducial set of phys-
ical parameters with β0 = 105, ΣFUV = 0.01 g cm−2,
Ta = 3Td and sT = 0.5, shown in Figure 2. We focus
our discussion on the solid lines in the Figure, and in
Section 3.1.3 we discuss the eﬀect of wind shielding by
comparing with the dashed lines in the Figure.

3.1.1. Disk Structure

The middle left panel shows the location of the FUV
ionization front za and wind base zb. We can see that
up to R ∼ 50 AU, the two locations coincide with each
other, meaning that the disk is largely laminar up to
this radius, with wind being the dominant mechanism
for angular momentum transport. The value of za/R in-
creases with increasing R, meaning that the FUV ioniza-
tion front traces a ﬂared geometry. On the other hand,
because the disk itself is ﬂared, we see from the inset
that when normalized to disk scale height, the value of
za/Hd decreases with increasing R. This means that the
FUV radiation eﬀectively penetrates deeper (geometri-
cally) towards the outer disk. The value of za/Hd is . 5
at 1 AU, and decreases to ∼ 3.5 at ∼ 100 AU. These
numbers are similar to local disk simulations where the
FUV penetration depth is measured in the vertical do-
main (Bai & Stone 2013b; Simon et al. 2013a).

Deeper penetration of FUVs towards the outer disk al-
lows the MRI to operate at R ∼ 50 AU and beyond in
our ﬁducial model. Correspondingly, the wind base loca-
tion zb no longer coincides with za, and is located higher
in the atmosphere. With za/Hd decreasing with R, the
extent of the MRI zone increases towards larger R, and
hence the value of ˜α increases towards the outer disk and
beyond. Nevertheless, because only a very small fraction
of mass resides in the MRI active zone, the averaged
value ˜α remains relatively small (. 10−3).

3.1.2. Accretion and Mass Loss

We ﬁnd that in the inner disk, the wind Alfv´en radius
(or lever arm) decreases with increasing R. This is a
consequence of zb/Hd getting smaller, and hence when
assuming constant midplane β0, the wind base is less
strongly magnetized (larger plasma β, or smaller vA0/cs,
at the wind base). As a result, the wind becomes less ef-
ﬁcient in transporting angular momentum towards larger
R, and the disk has to lose more mass to maintain its ac-
cretion rate (i.e., higher mass loading). When the MRI
zone is present, because we have have set ﬁxed β0 = 50
at the wind base location, the Alfv´en radius and mass
loading parameter become approximately constants (as
found in B16).

The middle right panel of Figure 2 shows the radial
proﬁles of wind-driven accretion rate, viscous accretion
rate, and wind mass loss rate per logarithmic radii. We
see that clearly, almost the entire disk relies on disk wind
to transport angular momentum. The only exception
is near the disk outer edge, where disk surface density
exponentially falls oﬀ and viscous transport picks up.
Because of the dominant role played by the wind, viscous
disk spread is largely suppressed, except for regions well
beyond the characteristic disk size of Rd = 100 AU.

Although we have made an artiﬁcial assumption that
midplane β0 is constant throughout the disk, the over-
all wind-driven accretion rate is approximately constant
over an extended range of disk radii, indicating that the
system shall approximately maintain a steady state. This
is related to the our initial disk surface density that
we have chosen, where the midplane pressure Pmid ∝
R−11/4. Assuming that the wind-driven accretion rate
depends quadratically on the ﬁeld strength (Wardle 2007;
Bai & Goodman 2009), a constant accretion rate would
z ∝ R−5/2, whose power law index is very close
require B2
to 11/4.
The mass loss proﬁle is best quantiﬁed by the mass loss
rate per logarithmic radii d ˙Mloss/d ln R, which is related
to wind-driven accretion rate by (see B16)

d ˙Mloss(R)/d ln R

˙Macc,w(R)

=

1

2(λ − 1)

.

(25)

As the lever arm λ ≡ [RA(R)/R]2 decreases towards
large R, we see that wind mass loss rate rapidly increases
with R. The mass loss rate per logarithmic radii is nearly
two orders of magnitude below the accretion rate at the
innermost radius, while it can become a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the accretion rate at tens of AU. Thus, we expect
that most of the mass loss in PPDs occurs through the
outer disk via very slow winds, in contrast with observa-
tions which typically can only trace winds launched from
the inner disk (see Section 6.2 for further discussion).

We also note that magnetic ﬁeld geometry from
typical disk wind simulations (e.g., Zanni et al. 2007;
Stepanovs & Fendt 2014) has larger inclination angle
with respect to the disk at small disk radius (θ > 45◦),
while θ becomes smaller towards the outer disk radii. If
we were to relax our assumption of constant ﬁeld inclina-
tion θ = 45◦, this would make λ larger in the inner disk
and smaller in the outer disk (though not by much in a
warm wind, as discussed in B16), and hence strengthen
our conclusion that mass loss is most signiﬁcant in the
outer disk.

Both wind-driven accretion rate and wind mass loss
rate drops when an MRI zone is present. This is can be
qualitatively understood from the middle panel of Figure
12 in B16. With the wind launched from higher location
hence lower density, both accretion and mass loss rates
decreases, and the latter decreases faster. It is this re-
duction of wind transport that leaves rooms for viscous
eﬀect to take over in the outermost region of the disk.

Readers may note a bump at small R in wind-driven
accretion and mass loss rates in Figure 2. This is due to
the inability to properly compute FUV penetration near
the inner boundaries, but it is only a minor eﬀect and
should not aﬀect the overall calculations.

beginning of evolution (t = 0) from our ﬁducial disk model (24). Top left: surface density proﬁle (multiplied by R/AU). Middle left:
location of the wind base zb (black), FUV ionization front za (red), together with disk thickness Hd (green), and disk atmosphere scale

inset. Bottom left: eﬀective viscosity α. Note that we have chosen α0 = 2 × 10−4 as a quiescent value throughout the disk. Larger α values
are due to the onset of the MRI. Top right: ratio of wind Alfv´en radius to wind launching radius. Middle right: wind-driven accretion rate
(red), viscous-driven accretion rate (black), and wind mass loss rate per logarithmic radii (blue). Note viscous accretion rate changes sign
at around R ∼ 140 AU. Bottom right: mass loading parameter of the disk wind. Solid lines correspond to our ﬁducial calculation results.
For comparison, we further show in dashed lines in all panels the results where we assume hydrostatic density proﬁle (15) extends all the
way in the disk atmosphere z > za, instead of using the enhanced density proﬁle (17) beyond the wind base z > zb (which incorporates
magnetic support).

3.1.3. Shielding of FUV by the Wind

Our calculations have incorporated the fact that a
disk wind enhances gas density in the disk atmosphere
compared with the hydrostatic case, using the approx-
imate ﬁtting formula (17). The enhanced density adds
to the column density that FUV radiation has to pen-
etrate, thus providing a certain level of shielding. This
shielding eﬀect has been discussed in the context of sur-
vival of molecules through various stages of disk evolu-
tion (Panoglou et al. 2012). Bans & K¨onigl (2012) fur-
ther pointed out that strong disk outﬂow launched from
the innermost region of PPDs may suppress the wind
launching process at larger radii by shielding FUV/X-
ray photons.

To assess the signiﬁcance of this shielding eﬀect, we
also perform a calculation that simply uses the hydro-
static density proﬁle (15) at z > za, and the results are
shown in dashed lines in Figure 2.

We see that indeed, using hydrostatic density proﬁle

makes FUV radiation penetrate deeper, giving smaller
za at all disk radii. Although the absolute diﬀerence
in za values is small, it can be more clearly seen in the
inset of the middle left panel. Because density drops very
rapidly with height in a Gaussian density proﬁle, a small
diﬀerence in za translates to much larger diﬀerence in the
density ρa there.

Without shielding, we see that the wind mass loss rate
becomes larger by a factor of nearly two. This is because
launching the wind from higher density means that the
wind is eﬀectively less magnetized, and hence become
more heavily loaded (see again from the middle panel of
Figure 12 in B16). Thus, the presence of the wind it-
self helps prevent more severe wind mass loss from the
disk (at a modest level). We also note that the wind
launched from the thermally ionized, fully turbulent in-
nermost disk, can also contribute to this shielding ef-
fect, which is not included in our calculations (see, e.g.,
Bans & K¨onigl 2012).

Fig. 3.— Radial proﬁles of main diagnostics for diﬀerent physical parameters. For comparison, we show results from the ﬁducial model
in dashed lines (from Figure 2), and we vary only one parameter relative to ﬁducial in each column and show results in solid lines. Left:
enhanced net vertical magnetic ﬂux with β0 = 104; middle: deepder FUV penetration depth ΣFUV = 0.1 g cm−2; right: higher disk
atmosphere temperature Ta = 8Td. Top panels show the location of FUV front za and wind base zb, and bottom panels show the radial
proﬁles of wind-driven accretion rate, and viscously-driven accretion rate, and wind mass loss rate.

In addition, we also see that without shielding, the
MRI active zone in the outer disk becomes both radially
broader and vertically thicker. At each radius, a higher
fraction of disk mass is located in the MRI active zone,
resulting in a larger ˜α.

3.2. Parameter Dependence

We discuss in this subsection the role played by in-
dividual physical parameters, including total magnetic
ﬂux (parameterized by midplane β0), FUV penetration
depth (ΣFUV), and atmosphere temperature (character-
ized by Ta/Td). We vary one parameter at a time. The
results are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Note that Figure
4 is exactly analogous to Figure 12 of B16, but applied
to a full disk model. In this Figure, we quote accretion
rate measured at 1 AU (as discussed earlier, accretion
rate proﬁle is largely ﬂat given our magnetic ﬂux pre-
scription). For mass loss, we quote the enclosed mass
loss rate (1) within radius of 1 AU, 10 AU and inﬁnity,
respectively, to exemplify the mass loss proﬁle.

3.2.1. Role of Vertical Field Strength

The left panels of Figure 3 show the eﬀect of enhanced
net vertical magnetic ﬂux, where we choose β0 = 104
at midplane. Because density structure in the vicinity
of the wind base does not change with magnetization
(see Section 2.2.2), the location of za remain largely un-
changed. Due to stronger magnetization, the outer disk
is less prone to the MRI and the MRI active zone shrinks.
While the α value is larger in the disk interior at all radii
to reﬂect potentially enhanced viscous transport (Sec-
tion 2.2.5), and yields higher viscous-driven accretion
rate, wind plays a more dominant role in global trans-
port: even in the disk outer edge, wind-driven accretion
rate overwhelms viscous decretion rate, and hence vis-
cous spread is suppressed.

Stronger vertical ﬁelds leads to much enhanced wind-
driven accretion rate, but only a modest increase in wind

mass loss rate. This eﬀect is better reﬂected in the left
panel of Figure 4, and has also been extensively discussed
in B16. For our ﬁducial parameters (midplane β0 = 105),
the mass loss rate integrated over the entire disk is about
the same as the mass accretion rate. The ratio drops to
∼ 38% and 14% for midplane β0 = 104 and 103 respec-
tively. Thus, level of disk magnetization largely controls
the fractional mass loss rate over accretion rate.

In addition, we see that mass loss from within 1 AU
represents only a very small fraction of total mass loss
rate, about 3 − 6%. This fraction increases to about
20 − 30% for mass loss enclosed with ∼ 10 AU. Thus,
we reinforce the conclusion that most of the mass loss is
achieved at the outer disk, which is probably not easily
observable.

3.2.2. Role of FUV Penetration Depth

The middle panels of Figure 3 shows the eﬀect of en-
hanced FUV penetration depth ΣFUV = 0.1 g cm−2.
Deeper penetration clearly lowers the location of za. In
the inner disk (before the MRI active zone appears), the
wind base density and pressure becomes higher, making
the wind less strongly magnetized. As discussed in B16,
this leads to the development of stronger toroidal ﬁeld,
which drives both higher wind-driven accretion rate, and
higher wind mass loss rate. With a reduction of the
Alfv´en radius, the mass loss rate increases more rapidly.
This trend is more clearly seen in the middle panel of
Figure 4, and is analogous to the middle panel of Figure
12 in B16. This is a manifestation of what we termed
“magneto-photoevaporation” in local wind study of B16
to a global disk model.

In the mean time, deeper FUV penetration enlarges
the MRI active zone both radially and vertically, leading
to enhanced viscous angular momentum transport. From
Figure 3, we see that viscous transport starts to dominate
over the wind at a smaller radius than in our ﬁducial case.
Nevertheless, this radius is still larger than our model
disk size of Rd = 100 AU, and hence wind transport still

dominates the bulk of disk evolution.

We also note that our calculation have ignored external
FUV irradiation, which likely dominates over FUV from
the star at a few tens to ∼ 100 AU scale (Adams et al.
2004), depending on the intensity of the external radia-
tion ﬁeld and stellar FUV luminosity. Such external irra-
diation, if suﬃciently strong, likely allows FUV to pen-
etrate deeper into the outer disk because they are not
shielded by the inner disk. Correspondingly, we would
expect the wind to become less eﬀective in the outer
disk, where viscous transport likely play a more signiﬁ-
cant role.

3.2.3. Role of Atmosphere Temperature

Disk atmosphere temperature mainly aﬀects wind
properties in two ways. First, it directly aﬀects wind
properties via thermodynamics, as studied in detail in
B16. Second, it modiﬁes the surface density structure.
In our two-temperature disk model, a hotter disk sur-
face ﬁrst leads to a smaller density right above the FUV
front due to pressure equilibrium at z = za. On the other
hand, ρ decreases with z much more slowly at z > za.
These two eﬀects turn out to approximately cancel and
only weakly aﬀect the geometric depth of FUV penetra-
tion, as seen from the right panel of Figure 3.

Assuming the atmosphere temperature does not aﬀect
the wind base location, B16 found that the overall wind-
driven accretion rate and wind mass loss rate are rela-
tively insensitive to variations in wind temperature. In-
corporating the changes in surface density structure, our
global calculations show that the same conclusion holds.
Further in Figure 4, we see that both mass accretion rate
and total mass loss rate are very insensitive to Ta/Td.

4. GLOBAL DISK EVOLUTION

In this section, we explore the long-term disk evolution
based on prescriptions described in Section 2.2. We here
mainly focus on the global mass budget, in terms of evo-
lution timescale, fractional mass loss through accretion
and wind, etc., to minimize uncertainties associated with
the magnetic ﬂux distribution and evolution.

4.1. The Fiducial Model

In Figures 5 and 6, we show the time evolution of disk
surface density, and the associated disk mass (Md), ac-
cretion rate and mass loss rate evolution, where accretion
rates are measured at the inner disk boundary. Two sce-
narios of magnetic ﬂux evolution are considered, namely,
either total magnetic ﬂux ΦB ∝ Md, or ΦB is constant.
We see that at early stages, disk evolution proceeds very
similarly in these two scenarios. After about 1 Myrs, the
disk has lost about 30% of its mass through accretion
and wind, and the subsequent evolutionary paths in the
two scenarios diverge.

When assuming ΦB ∝ Md, the accretion rate grad-
ually decreases with time as magnetic ﬂux is lost, and
the evolution slows down. Even after 107 years of evolu-
tion, the disk still possesses about 23% of its initial mass.

Fig. 6.— Left: Time evolution of total disk mass (black), mass accreted to the central protostar (red), and mass lost through the wind
(blue). Right top: time evolution of midplane plasma β0, assumed to be constant at all disk radii. Right bottom: time evolution of
accretion rate at inner boundary (black) and total mass loss rate (red). In both panels, solid lines correspond to the case where total
magnetic ﬂux ΦB is set to be proportional to disk mass Md, while dashed lines represent the case where ΦB is conserved.

We also see that midplane β0 slowly increases with time,
and towards later evolution, wind mass loss rate exceeds
accretion rate.

When assuming ΦB is constant, on the other hand,
we see that accretion rate and mass loss rate maintain
approximately a constant level for ∼ 2 Myrs. This is
because magnetic ﬁeld strength roughly stays constant
in this scenario, which directly regulates accretion rates.
Constant accretion/mass loss rates lead to rapid deple-
tion of disk materials, and we see that total disk mass
plunges down in a runaway manner shortly after t ∼ 2
Myrs. As the majority of disk mass is accreted or lost,
FUV radiation can penetrate substantially deeper, en-
hancing the mass loss process relative to accretion. In
the mean time, the MRI active zone grows and allows
viscous spread to dominate in the outermost disk. The
reduction of accretion rate near the end is a result of the
redistribution of magnetic ﬂux towards the outer disk
(due to viscous spreading).

The two scenarios discussed here can be considered as
two extreme limits on magnetic ﬂux evolution. Rapid
loss of magnetic ﬂux leads to slow evolution and long
disk lifetime, while conservation of magnetic ﬂux leads
to a two-timescale behavior: disk depletion occurs on
timescales much shorter than disk lifetime. The latter
behavior was also discussed by Armitage et al. (2013)
when assuming constant total magnetic ﬂux. The real-
ity may lie in between the two extreme scenarios, which
we use in the next subsection as a way to constrain disk
lifetime.

For comparison, we also show in dash-dotted lines of
Figure 5 results from a pure viscous disk evolution model
assuming constant α = 0.01. Besides the sequential drop
in surface density, disk evolution is characterized by the
expansion of the outer disk (viscous spreading). Over the
course of a few Myrs, the disk size (deﬁned by the radius
above a certain threshold surface density) have expanded

by more than a factor of 2. This is much more signiﬁcant
than that in our ﬁducial disk evolution models, even vis-
cous spreading dominates in the outermost region of the
disk. Thus, we conclude that wind-dominated PPD evo-
lution likely undergoes very little expansion of the outer
disk as compared with viscous evolution models.

4.2. Parameter Dependence

To better quantify the timescale of disk evolution and
the signiﬁcance of mass loss from disk winds, we have
carried out a series of disk evolution calculations scan-
ning the parameter space. Because we have found that
the wind transport properties are the least sensitive to
wind temperature Ta, we ﬁx Ta/Td = 3 in all the calcu-
lations. We consider midplane plasma β0 = 103, 104, 105
and 106, and FUV penetration depth ΣFUV = 0.01 and
0.1 g cm−2.

We do not evolve the disk all the way to the end, but
terminate the evolution when the disk has lost half of its
mass, and call this time half disk lifetime thalf . We do
so mainly because long-term evolution calculations likely
bare large uncertainties due to our ignorance on magnetic
ﬂux evolution. For each set of parameters, we perform
two runs, evolving the disk either assuming magnetic ﬂux
conservation ΦB = const, or ΦB ∝ Md. As discussed
earlier, we may consider these two cases as two extreme
scenarios, which set the lower and upper limits of thalf .6
Similarly, we evaluate fwind, the fractional mass loss from
the wind compared to total mass loss due to both wind
and accretion, over evolution time up to thalf.

In Figure 7, we plot thalf and fwind from all runs in this
parameter study, organized as a function of initial mid-

6 Observationally, disk lifetime is inferred statistically by count-
ing disk fraction (Haisch et al. 2001), which reﬂects full disk life-
time tfull. Based on our results,
if magnetic ﬂux is approxi-
mately conserved during disk evolution, we approximately have
thalf ∼ tfull/2. If the disk loses magnetic ﬂux, then thalf < tfull/2.

plane β0. It best summaries the main results discussed
in this paper.

Disk lifetime is determined by a combination of mass
accretion and mass loss processes.
It mostly depends
on the amount of magnetic ﬂux threading the disks.
For our ﬁducial disk model, midplane plasma β0 ∼ 105
yields 2 × thalf that is in best agreement with obser-
vational constraints of disk lifetime (e.g., Haisch et al.
2001; Fedele et al. 2010) on a few Myr time scale.
It
also supports the interpretation of fossil magnetic ﬁeld
measurement of the solar nebular (Fu et al. 2014). Note
that increasing or reducing the ﬁeld strength by a factor
of only ∼ 3 (a factor ∼ 10 change in β0) would yield disk
lifetime that is either too short or too long.
All calculations with β0 = 105 yield a fractional wind
mass loss fwind around one half (0.3-0.7). Wind mass loss
becomes progressively less important towards stronger
disk magnetization, but such scenario is very unlikely as
constrained by disk lifetime. Therefore, we expect that
wind mass loss plays a rather signiﬁcant role in global
disk evolution.

Enhanced FUV luminosity (hence its penetration)
leads to both enhanced accretion rate, and to a higher
level, outﬂow rates (and hence larger fwind). In our ﬁdu-
cial model, fwind increases from from 0.45 to 0.65 as
ΣFUV increases from 0.01 to 0.1 g cm−2, which mani-
fests what we termed magneto-photoevaporation in B16.
The contrast between mass accretion and outﬂow is more
prominent as the disk becomes more strongly magne-
tized. On the other hand, because of the relatively gen-
˙Macc and ˙Mwind on ΣFUV (see Figure
tle dependence of
4), reduction of thalf is only modest. A factor of 10 dif-
ference in ΣFUV typically leads to a factor of at most 3
diﬀerence in thalf .

5. MODEL EXTENSION

5.1. Level of Disk Flaring

In this subsection, we consider disks that are less
ﬂared, which is expected to aﬀect the penetration of

FUV/X-rays in heating/ionizing the disk surface layer.
Although the temperature structure of PPDs is not well
constrained observationally, this study is in part moti-
vated by the SED-based classiﬁcation of Herbig Ae/Be
disks that show two distinct groups with either ﬂared or
ﬂat geometry (Meeus et al. 2001), It has recently been
found that ﬂared Herbig Ae/Be disks all have large gaps
(Maaskant et al. 2013), and some ﬂat disks may have
small gaps (Menu et al. 2015), suggesting a evolutionary
path starting from ﬂat full disks towards ﬂared transi-
tion disks. Note that this classiﬁcation mainly reﬂects
disk geometry at ∼AU scale, where ﬂat disks are gen-
erally attributed to self-shadowing by puﬀed inner rims
(Dullemond & Dominik 2004). Even many disks are con-
sidered “ﬂat”, they can become ﬂared towards larger
radii (e.g., Rosenfeld et al. 2013 for the HD 163296 disk).
Despite the complications and uncertainties in our under-
standings of disk geometry and temperature structure,
we aim to assess whether they can signiﬁcantly aﬀect
disk wind/transport properties in a qualitative manner
by simply varying the parameter sT . Note that sT = 1
would lead to a constant H/R, which is unlikely to be
realized on a global scale when balancing passive stellar
heating with thermal radiation.

In Figure 8, we compare the results from our ﬁducial
model with normal level of ﬂaring (ﬁducial, sT = 0.5), a
model with less ﬂaring (sT = 0.7), and an almost ﬂat disk
(sT = 0.9). Note that increasing sT makes the disk cooler
towards the outer disk, with smaller disk scale height Hd.
Correspondingly, the geometric location of the FUV front
za becomes lower. On the other hand, we see from the left
panel of the Figure that when normalized to disk scale
height, za/Hd becomes progressively higher as the disk
becomes less ﬂared. This is simply a geometric eﬀect that
at the same z/Hd, sight lines to the central star would
encounter larger column density of gas in a less ﬂared
disk.
In addition, we see that in less ﬂared disks, the
size of the MRI active zone shrinks. This is also natural
consequence of larger za/Hd. With sT = 0.7, the inner
edge of the MRI active zone is already at R > Rd in our

disk model, while for a nearly ﬂat disk with sT = 0.9,
the MRI active zone diminishes: the entire disk becomes
largely laminar.

With larger za/Hd in less ﬂared disks, the wind base
density and pressure is smaller, making the wind base
region eﬀectively more strongly magnetized. As shown
in the right panel of Figure 8, the Alfv´en radius becomes
larger in less ﬂared disks. This means that wind mass
loss rate becomes a smaller fraction of accretion rate (see
Equation (25)). This is also reﬂected in Figure 7, where
we also show results of thalf and fraction mass loss with
sT = 0.7. Overall, the situation for less ﬂared disk is sim-
ilar to the case with smaller ΣFUV: less ﬂared disks lead
to a reduction of both wind-driven accretion rate and
mass loss rate (and hence longer thalf ), but the reduction
of mass loss rate is more signiﬁcant.

5.2. Eﬀect of X-ray Heating

The studies in the preceding sections have implicitly
assumed that X-rays and FUV have similar penetra-
tion depth, as described in Section 2.2. In reality, FUV
penetration depth is very uncertain depending on the
abundance of very small grains, while absorption of X-
ray photons is insensitive to grain abundance, and de-
pends mainly on photon energy (Igea & Glassgold 1999;
Ercolano & Glassgold 2013). For typical photon energy
of 1 keV, the X-ray penetration depth is on the order 1022
cm−2 (e.g., Owen et al. 2010), and it becomes larger for
higher photon energies. This is at least comparable to
the ﬁducial value of ΣFUV = 0.01 g cm−2 that we have
adopted. However, considering the full X-ray spectrum
with the presence of harder X-rays, the overall penetra-
tion depth is likely higher. In this subsection, we relax
our previous assumption and allow X-rays to penetrate
deeper than the FUV. We deﬁne X-ray penetration depth
ΣX ≥ ΣFUV, which determines the location of atmo-
sphere za. Gas temperature is set to T = Td for z < za
and T = Ta for z > za, as before. 7 Let zf be the height

7 We note that in reality, X-ray heating proﬁle is likely much
more smooth than the FUV case, and hence the two-temperature

of the FUV ionization front set by ΣFUV, and zf ≥ za.
The wind base is assumed to be located at zb = zf if gas
is suﬃciently magnetized to suppress the MRI, otherwise,
zb is set to larger values according to the prescription in
Section 2.2.4.

In Figure 9, we compare the results from our ﬁducial
model with ΣFUV = ΣX = 0.01 g cm−2 (solid lines) with
a calculation assuming ΣX = 0.1 g cm−2 (dashed lines).
The left panel shows the value of Alfv´en radius normal-
ized to wind launching radius. We see that despite that
X-rays can heat into deeper regions in the disk, leading to
substantial diﬀerences in disk vertical density and tem-
perature structures, the wind properties resulting from
the two cases are remarkably similar. This is most easily
understood from the example in the right panel, where
we show the vertical pressure proﬁles at 1 AU in the two
cases. With T = Ta at disk surface layer, the density pro-
ﬁle, as well as pressure proﬁle, are in the form of e−z2/H2
a .
If we assume the column densities (from a position at
disk surface) radially towards the star and vertically to-
wards large z are proportional to each other (which ap-
proximately holds for ﬂared disks where column density
is dominated by local contributions), then for a given
ΣFUV, the density and pressure at the FUV ionization
front zf (= zb in this case) are largely unchanged re-
gardless of whether X-rays penetrate deeper or not. In
this example, we ﬁnd the pressure (and density) diﬀer-
ence between the two cases at z = zf is only 15%, which
explains the very small diﬀerence in RA. Therefore, we
conclude that density and pressure at the wind base (and
hence the main wind properties) is largely insensitive to
additional heating by X-rays below the FUV ionization
front. We have also veriﬁed this result using higher at-
mosphere temperature Ta = 8Td, and with larger ΣX up
to 0.5 g cm−2.

proﬁle with a sharp temperature transition at z = za may no longer
be a good approximation. However, we mainly aim at a proof-of-
concept study on the role of deeper X-ray heating, and a two-
temperature treatment should suﬃce for this purpose.

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Relation to Photoevaporation

Photoevaporation has long been considered as the pri-
mary mechanism for the dispersal of PPDs. As a pure
thermal wind, it does not exert a torque to the disk, and
hence would evaporate the disk regardless of internal pro-
cesses of disk angular momentum transport. However, as
MHD wind has been realized to play the dominant role in
disk angular momentum transport, we expect real PPD
winds to be magnetized in nature, and they are exter-
nally heated. Therefore, wind mass loss and angular mo-
mentum transport are intrinsically coupled. They are
both aﬀected by thermal eﬀects, and they jointly deter-
mine global disk evolution.

Incorporating the magneto-thermal disk wind model
of B16, our model has included, in a simple approximate
manner, all major ingredients of the aforementioned new
framework of global disk evolution. Compared with pho-
toevaporation calculations, wind mass loss in our calcu-
lations is directly coupled to angular momentum trans-
port, instead of being treated separately. This leads to
the correlation between disk lifetime and fractional wind
mass loss, as a natural consequence of MHD disk wind.
Photoevaporation calculations are highly sensitive
to the treatment of
thermodynamics, which leads
to considerable discrepancies between diﬀerent mod-
els
those driven by Extreme UV (e.g.,
Hollenbach et al. 1994; Alexander et al. 2006), X-rays
(e.g., Ercolano et al. 2009; Owen et al. 2010), and FUV
(e.g., Adams et al. 2004; Gorti et al. 2009). While our
calculations have treated thermodynamics in a highly
simpliﬁed manner, our main results suggest that wind
mass loss is only modestly sensitive to thermodynamic
eﬀects, whereas the dominant role is played by amount
of magnetic ﬂux. As suggested in B16, a uniﬁed de-
scription of disk wind mass loss would be better termed
“magneto-photoevaporation”.

such as

Photoevaporation has been commonly invoked as an
explanation of (a fraction of) transition disks, a small
fraction of PPDs characterized by the presence of large
inner gaps/holes, by inside-out clearing (see Owen 2015

for a review). In the MHD framework, whether the disk
can be cleared inside-out depends on the details of mag-
netic ﬂux evolution, which remains poorly understood.
For instance, if the inner disk is capable of maintaining
its total magnetic ﬂux (e.g., possibly due to the Hall ef-
fect), while the outer disk loses ﬂux (i.e., as a result of
ambipolar diﬀusion), then inside-out clearing would be a
natural consequence.

6.2. Implications

One important implication of wind mass loss is that
mass is primarily removed from disk surface, while in
low turbulent environment, most dust/solids settle and
reside around disk midplane. The removal of largely
dust-free gas, and in combination with radial drift (e.g.,
Youdin & Shu 2002), can directly enhance the dust-to-
gas mass ratio, creating favorable conditions for plan-
etesimal formation (Johansen et al. 2009b), and particu-
larly allowing for smaller, more strongly coupled dust to
participate in planetesimal formation (Bai & Stone 2010;
Carrera et al. 2015). Dust evolution has been incorpo-
rated in the recent study by Gorti et al. (2015) in the
context of photoevaporation on top of viscous disk evo-
lution, and they found signiﬁcant enhancement of dust-
to-gas ratio as a robust outcome of surface mass loss.
We thus expect the same conclusion to hold in the MHD
wind, or magneto-photoevaporation framework. The fact
that wind mass loss is most signiﬁcant towards the outer
disk implies that the enhancement of dust-to-gas ratio
may proceed from the outer disk inward.

Signatures of wind from PPDs have been routinely ob-
served in the form of blue-shifted emission lines such
as from CO, OI and NeII lines (e.g., Pascucci & Sterzik
2009; Pontoppidan et al. 2011; Herczeg et al. 2011), but
constraining the wind mass loss rate from line data is ex-
tremely diﬃcult.8 Natta et al. (2014) recently reported
˙Mloss/ ˙Macc in the range of 0.1 − 1 with large uncertain-
ties. With typical blueshift of the order a few km s−1 and

8 For the high-velocity jet,

˙Mloss,jet/ ˙Macc is found to be of the

order 0.1 with large uncertainties (Hartigan et al. 1995).

Global Evolution of PPDs

given the excitation conditions, the wind most likely orig-
inates from the inner few AU. Our results suggest that
the inferred mass loss rate only represents a small frac-
tion (< 20 − 30%) of total disk wind mass loss. Within
the uncertainties, the measurements are consistent with
our expectations of

˙Mloss & ˙Macc.

We have discussed in Section 3.1.3 that the column
density in the wind ﬂow can provide shielding for the UV
radiation from the protostar. Wind shielding has also
been discussed in the context of survival of molecules
(Panoglou et al. 2012).
In reality, FUV penetration is
largely determined by the abundance of very small grains
in the disk surface and wind column, which is very
poorly known. We speculate that if very small grains
are suﬃciently abundant at disk surface, they can be
eﬃciently lifted by the wind (e.g., Miyake et al. 2016),
which can substantially enhance the FUV opacity. The
non-detection of turbulent motion towards the outer re-
gion of Herbig Ae disk HD 163296 (Flaherty et al. 2015)
also indirectly suggests that shielding of FUV radiation
may reduce or even quench the MRI zone in the outer
disk. Our ﬁducial choice of a relatively small ΣFUV re-
ﬂects such considerations, but the potentially important
eﬀect of wind shielding calls for further study.

6.3. Limitations and Future Directions

Our global model inherits from the wind model of B16,
thus share the same uncertainties, especially from the
fact that we prescribe the wind geometry instead of solv-
ing cross-ﬁeld force balance. However, as discussed there,
more uncertainties arise from our ignorance about mag-
netic ﬂux distribution, which eventually determines the
wind geometry. Thus, B16 chose to parameterize the
disk geometry and focus on wind physics along prescribed
ﬁeld lines. Our global wind model follows the same logic,
and mainly explores the consequence of the B16 model
at a global scale.

Our wind model may suﬀer from two systematic un-
certainties. The ﬁrst arises from a potentially system-
atic variation of wind geometry with radius. For in-
stance, global wind simulations (e.g., Zanni et al. 2007;
Stepanovs & Fendt 2014) typically ﬁnd that towards
larger radii, the wind inclination angle θ increases, and
wind ﬁeld lines get more divergent. We have adopted
ﬁxed wind geometry parameters θ = 45◦ and q = 0.25
in this work. Based on results from the B16 model,
with ﬁeld lines getting more inclined and more diver-
gent, the Alfven radius (lever arm) would decrease, lead-
ing to more pronounced fractional mass loss towards
the outer disk. The second uncertainty arises from
the extension of the B16 wind model to wind launched
from the MRI active region, whereas the model is in-
tended for a laminar wind. Wind launching in the MRI
case is a robust phenomenon as observed in local sim-
ulations (Suzuki & Inutsuka 2009; Bai & Stone 2013a;
Fromang et al. 2013; Simon et al. 2013a), and the ﬁeld
conﬁguration is fully dominated by the toroidal com-
ponent indicating wind launching by magnetic pressure
gradient, similar to the laminar wind in PPDs discussed
in B16. We thus expect our treatment at least quali-
tatively reﬂects the relation between mass loss and an-
gular momentum transport in this regime, while global
simulations are certainly needed to better calibrate wind

kinematics.

Our calculations parameterize the role of thermody-
namics simply in terms of FUV (and X-ray) penetration,
constant wind temperature and level of disk ﬂaring. In
reality, radiative transfer and photo-chemistry are essen-
tial to better quantify thermodynamical eﬀects. Due to
the important role played by grain opacity, these are
coupled with the size distribution and spatial distribu-
tion of dust grains, which in turn are coupled to disk
dynamics. The interplay among dynamics, dust evolu-
tion, chemistry, and radiation in the system may result
in much richer phenomenology than considered here, and
are worth more in-depth investigations.

The sensitive dependence of wind and transport prop-
erties on magnetic ﬁeld strength calls for better under-
standings of magnetic ﬂux transport, as already dis-
cussed in Section 2.2.3. Moreover, the starting point of
our evolution calculations is motivated from a typical
disk at Class II phase. Disk evolution starts from much
earlier phases, and magnetic ﬂux is well known to control
disk dynamics from the disk formation stage (see Li et al.
2014 for a review). In particular, the Hall eﬀect could
induce a bimodality on initial disk size depending on the
polarity of the background magnetic ﬁeld with respect to
disk rotation axis (Tsukamoto et al. 2015; Wurster et al.
2016), and such bimodality is likely to be carried into all
later phases of disk evolution (Wardle & Salmeron 2012;
Bai 2014, 2015; Simon et al. 2015). How the Hall eﬀect
aﬀect magnetic ﬂux evolution is unknown, but hints for
strong polarity dependence exist from local studies (Bai
2014). Our Figure 7 shows that to reproduce observed
PPD lifetime, the amount of magnetic ﬂux is constrained
to a relatively narrow range. Some feedback and self-
regulation mechanism might be involved in magnetic ﬂux
evolution. Future global simulations of wind-driven disk
evolution with resolved disk microphysics are essential to
address these problems.

7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have constructed a framework to study
global evolution of PPDs that incorporates wind-driven
accretion, wind mass loss, and viscous transport. The
magneto-thermal wind model the B16 is adopted as the
primary ingredient of the framework. The model is mo-
tivated by recent local simulations of PPD gas dynamics
that have properly incorporated disk microphysics, which
suggest that the MRI is largely suppressed in the disk in-
terior and magnetized wind is launched in the externally
heated and ionized surface layer from the FUV ionization
front (Bai & Stone 2013b; Gressel et al. 2015). We fur-
ther consider the fact that the well ionized surface layer
can be subject to the MRI in the outer region of PPDs
(Perez-Becker & Chiang 2011; Simon et al. 2013a), de-
pending on the strength of vertical magnetic ﬁeld ﬁelds
and FUV penetration depth, which contributes to vis-
cous angular momentum transport. Ideally, disk evolu-
tion should be coupled with a procedure for magnetic
ﬂux evolution. The latter is treated phenomenologically
in this work by assuming constant midplane plasma β0,
but can be improved upon better understanding of mag-
netic ﬂux transport in PPDs.

Our main ﬁndings include
• Disk evolution is largely dominated by MHD wind-

driven accretion and mass loss. Contribution from
the MRI can be important in the outermost disk
but viscous spread is suppressed.

• The disk evolution timescale sensitively depends on
the amount of magnetic ﬂux threading PPDs. Disk
dispersal is rapid if the disk is able to retain most of
its magnetic ﬂux during evolution, otherwise, disk
dispersal is gradual.

• Given typical disk lifetime of a few Myrs, the disk
loses comparable amount of mass via disk wind and
accretion. Most of the wind mass loss proceeds
through the outer disk (& 10 AU). Fractional mass
loss via disk wind increases with decreasing disk
magnetization (increasing disk lifetime).

• The depth of FUV penetration and level of disk
ﬂaring are the main thermodynamic factors af-
fecting disk evolution.
Smaller FUV penetra-
tion depth and less ﬂared geometry slightly reduce
wind-driven accretion rate, and more strongly re-
duces fractional wind mass loss.

In addition, the column density in the wind ﬂow can pro-
vide a modest level of shielding to stellar UV radiation,
especially if the wind lifts very small dust grains.

This work represents an initial eﬀort towards modeling
global evolution of PPDs that incorporates realistic disk
physics. At the moment, we have mainly focused on the
evolution of the overall mass budget, and signiﬁcant wind
mass loss likely substantial enhances the disk dust-to-gas
mass ratio and directly promotes planetesimal formation.
Better knowledge on magnetic ﬂux evolution is needed
to make reliable predictions on the details of disk surface
density evolution, allowing for more realistic studies of
planet formation.
