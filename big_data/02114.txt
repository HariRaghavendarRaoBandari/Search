HILBERT SCHEME OF POINTS ON CYCLIC QUOTIENT

SINGULARITIES OF TYPE (p, 1)

´AD ´AM GYENGE

Abstract. In this note we investigate the generating series of the Euler character-
istics of Hilbert scheme of points on cyclic quotient singularities of type (p, 1). We
link the appearing combinatorics to p-fountains, a generalization of the notion of
fountain of coins. We obtain a representation of the generating series as coeﬃcient
of a two variable generating series.

1. Introduction

1.1. Hilbert schemes of points. For a complex quasi-projective surface X and a
positive integer n, let Hilbn(X) be the Hilbert scheme of n points on X parametrizing
the zero-dimensional subschemes of X of length n. As a set, it consists of ideals I
of the ring OX of regular functions on X, such that OX /I is an n-dimensional C-
vector space. The disjoint union of these spaces for all n is denoted as Hilb(X). In
this paper we are interested in the topological Euler-characteristics of the Hilbert
schemes of points on X. We collect these in a generating series:

ZX(q) =Xn≥0

qnχ(Hilbn(X)).

The Hilbert scheme of points on smooth surfaces is an object investigated for a
long time. It has turned out that it carries a rich geometrical structure, see e.g. [4].
By a theorem of Fogarty, it is a smooth variety. The following result of G¨ottsche
gives an expression of the generating series of the Poincar´e polynomial of the Hilbert
schemes of points on X in terms of the Betti numbers of X.

Theorem 1.1 ([2]). If X is a smooth quasi-projective surface, then

where bi(X) is the i-th Betti number of X, and Pt(Y ) =Pi≥0 tibi(Y ).

1.2. Cyclic quotient singularities and orbifolds. Fix a positive integer p. Let
Zp be the cyclic group of order p with generator g and let it act on C2 as: g.x = e
p x,
p y where q is coprime to p. Then we get an action of Zp on C2 which is
g.y = e
totally discontinuous away from the origin. Let X(p, q) denote the quotient variety.
It is called the cyclic quotient singularity of type (p, q).

The Hilbert scheme Hilb(X(p, q)) of points on X(p, q) is the moduli space of ideals
in OX(p,q) = C[x, y]Zp of ﬁnite colength. The case when q = p − 1 is called the type
A singularity. It was considered in [3]. We are now interested in the other extreme
case when q = 1, that is, in calculating

1.3. The result. Our main result is a representation of ZX(p,1)(q) as coeﬃcient of a
two variable generating function. In these two variable generating function continued

fractions appear. We introduce the notation [z0]Pn Anzn = A0.

Theorem 1.3. Let F (q, z) and T (q, z) be the functions deﬁned in (5) and (8) below,
respectively. Then:

ZX(p,1)(q) = [z0]T (q, z)(cid:0)F (q−1, z−1) − (qz)−pF (q−1, (qz)−1)(cid:1) .

(1) For p = 1, X(1, 1) = C2. Then, by Corollary 1.2, ZX(1,1)(q) is

those results, that ZX(2,1)(q) is also equal to

2. Proof

2.1. Torus action on X(p, 1). Let us ﬁx p once and for all. The surface singularity
it carries a (C∗)2-action with an isolated ﬁxed point. On the
X(p, 1) is toric, i.e.
level of regular functions the ﬁxed points are the monomials in

A := OX(p,1) = C[x, y]Zp ∼= C[xp, xp−1y, . . . , xyp−1, yp].

The (C∗)2-action lifts to Hilbn(X(p, 1)) for each n. The action of (C∗)2 on
Hilbn(X(p, 1)) again has only isolated ﬁxed points which are given by the ﬁnite
colength monomial ideals in A.

It is well known that ﬁnite colength monomial ideals inside C[x, y] are in one-to-
one correspondence with partitions and with Young diagrams. The generators of a
monomial ideal are the functions corresponding to those blocks in the complement
of the diagram which are at the corners. Since A ⊂ C[x, y], each ﬁxed point of the
(C∗)2-action on Hilbn(X(p, 1)) corresponds to a Young diagram.

A block at position (i, j) is called a 0-block if i + j ≡ 0 (mod n). We will call a
Young diagram 0-generated if its generator blocks are 0-blocks. The 0-weight of a
(not necessarily 0-generated) Young diagram λ is the number of 0-blocks inside the
Young diagram. It is denoted as wt0(λ). Let P0 be the set of 0-generated Young
diagrams. It decomposes as

where P0(n) is the set of 0-generated Young diagrams which have 0-weight n.

P0(n),

P0 = Gn≥0

Example 2.1. If p = 3, then the following is a 0-generated Young diagram (we also
indicated the generating 0-blocks):

0

0

The 0-weight of this Young diagram is 3.

The generators of any ideal of A, when considered as functions in C[x, y], have to

be invariant under the Zp-action. This implies the following statement.

Lemma 2.2. The monomial ideals inside A of colength n are in one-to-one corre-
spondence with the 0-generated Young diagrams in P0(n).

Corollary 2.3.

ZX(p,1)(q) = Xλ∈P0

qwt0(λ) =Xn≥0

|P0(n)|qn,

where |S| denotes the number of elements in the set S.

2.2. Augmentation of 0-generated Young diagrams. For any 0-generated
Young diagram, we can consider the area which is between the diagram and the
line x + y = c. Here c is an integer congruent to 0 modulo p and it is as small as
possible such that the line x + y = c does not intersect the diagram. In other words,
this line is just the antidiagonal closest to the diagram. The line cuts out the small-
est isosceles right-angled triangle which contains the whole diagram. In the case of
Example 2.1, this looks as follows:

If, for example, p = 1 then the area between the diagram, the x and y coordinate
axes, and the above mentioned antidiagonal, when rotated 45 degrees counterclock-
wise and ﬂipped, is a special type of a fountain of coins as introduced in [5]. An
(n, k) fountain (of coins) is an arrangement of n coins in rows such that there are
exactly k consecutive coins in the bottom row, and such that each coin in a higher
row touches exactly two coins in the next lower row. In our case, the 0-blocks in the
area under consideration (which is colored grey in the diagram above) are replaced
by coins or circles or zero symbols.

We generalize this notion to arbitrary p. An (n, k) p-fountain is an arrangement

of n coins in rows such that

• there are exactly k consecutive coins in the bottom row,
• immediately below each coin there are exactly p+1 “descendant” coins in the

next lower row,

• and p coins among the descendants of two neighboring coins coincide.

4

In other words, we rotate and ﬂip the area between the axes and a speciﬁc antidi-
agonal, and the coins can be placed exactly on the 0-blocks, such that if there is a
coin somewhere, then there has to be coins on all the 0-blocks in the area which have
higher x or y coordinates in the original orientation of the plane. The empty diagram
is considered as a (0, 0) p-fountain.

Continuing the case of Example 2.1 further, the associated (9, 7) 3-fountain is

0

0

0

0

0

Here we also indicated the descendants of the coins in the upper row.

An (n, k) p-fountain is called primitive if its next-to-bottom row contains no empty
positions, i.e. contains k − p coins. In particular, the fountain with p coins in the
bottom row but with no coin in the higher rows is primitive, but the ones with less
than p coins in the bottom row are not primitive. The fountains that appear between
our 0-generated Young diagrams and the diagonals are special because in each case
there is at least one empty position in the next-to-bottom row, so they correspond
exactly to the non-primitive p-fountains.

Let f (n, k) (reps., g(n, k)) be the number of arbitrary (resp., primitive )(n, k) p-

fountains. Let F (q, z) = Pn,k≥0 f (n, k)qnzk (resp., G(q, z) = Pn,k≥0 g(n, k)qnzk) be

the two variable generating function of the sequence f (n, k) (resp., g(n, k)). We will
calculate F (q, z) and G(q, z) by extending the ideas of [5].

By removing the bottom row of a primitive (n, k) p-fountain one obtains a (n −

k, k − p) p-fountain. Therefore,

g(n, k) = f (n − k, k − p)

(n ≥ k, k ≥ p),

and

(1)

We prescribe that

G(q, z) = (qz)pF (q, qz).

(2)

f (0, 0) = · · · = f (p − 1, p − 1) = 1 and g(0, 0) = · · · = g(p − 1, p − 1) = 0.

Let us consider an arbitrary (n, k) p-fountain F , and assume that the ﬁrst empty
position in the next-to-bottom row is the r-th (1 ≤ r ≤ k − p + 1). Then we can split
F into a primitive (m + p − 1, r + p − 1) p-fountain and a not necessarily primitive
(n − m, k − r) p-fountain after the ﬁrst and before the last descendant coin of the
above mentioned missing r-th position. The descendant coins at the second to the
penultimate positions will be doubled.

Sticking to our favorite Example 2.1, the splitting looks as follows:

The dashed line on the left picture indicates the missing coin from the second row
and its descendants. The primitive part is to the left of the right parenthesis, while
the remaining part is to the right of the left parenthesis.

This factorization is unique.

0≤r≤k−p+1

g(m + p − 1, r + p − 1)f (n − m, k − r)

(n, k ≥ p).

The conditions m ≤ n − p + 1 and r ≤ k − p + 1 are equivalent to p − 1 ≤ n − m and
p − 1 ≤ k − r respectively. That is, the other remaining fountain has to have a ﬁrst
row of length at least p − 1. From (2) we see that F (q, z) has the form

F (q, z) = 1 + qz + · · · + (qz)p−1 + . . . .

Then F (q, z) − 1 − qz − · · · − (qz)p−2 is exactly the generating function of fountains,
which have a ﬁrst row of length at least p − 1, that is, which can appear as the second
factor on the right hand side of (3). Therefore,

(qz)−p+1G(q, z)(F (q, z) − 1 − qz − · · · − (qz)p−2)

enumerates all p-fountains for which n, k ≥ p. The generating function of all p-
fountains then satisﬁes
(4) F (q, z) = 1 + qz + · · ·+ (qz)p−1 + (qz)−p+1G(q, z)(F (q, z) −1 −qz −· · ·−(qz)p−2).

Using (4),

(F (q, z) − 1 − qz − · · · − (qz)p−2)(1 − (qz)−p+1G(q, z)) = (qz)p−1.

Then, by (1), the generating function of p-fountains is

F (q, z) =

h(n, k) = f (n, k) − g(n, k),

which gives

for the generating series H(q, z) of the numbers h(n, k).

2.3. Completion of the proof. As mentioned in 2.2, we augment each 0-generated
Young diagram to the smallest isosceles right-angled triangle. The area between
the diagram and the triangle will be a p-fountain. For a ﬁxed p, the hypotenuse of
the possible isosceles right-angled triangles contains lp + 1 blocks, where l is a non-
negative integer. The number of 0-blocks in the triangle with lp + 1 blocks on the
2 + l + 1. Therefore, the two variable generating

series of these triangles is

hypotenuse is P0≤i≤l ip + 1 = p l(l+1)

We will see immediately, that adding the terms with negative l will not aﬀect the

The generating series of 0-generated Young diagrams is then

Taking the coeﬃcient of z0 ensures that the hypotenuse of the triangle and the bottom
row of the p-fountain match together, and also that the terms of T (q, z) with negative
powers of z do not contribute into the result. Putting together Corollary 2.3, (7)and
(9) gives Theorem 1.3.
