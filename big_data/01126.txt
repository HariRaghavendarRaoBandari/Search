We study, using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, the ground state properties of a one
dimensional Rabi-Hubbard model. The model consists of a lattice of Rabi systems coupled by a
photon hopping term between near neighbor sites. The phase diagram consists of only two phases: a
coherent phase and an incoherent one. The Mott phases which are present in the Jaynes-Cummings-
Hubbard model are not observed here due to the presence of non-negligible counter-rotating terms.
We ﬁnd that these two models become equivalent when the detuning is negative and large enough,
or if the counter-rotating terms are small enough.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the possibility to build [1, 2] elemen-
tary cavity quantum electrodynamics systems, whether
formed by an atom in a cavity [3] or by a Josephson junc-
tion coupled to microwave photons on a chip [4], opened
the perspective to build new many body systems from
such elementary cavities.

The Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model [5] is
the simplest model describing such an array of coupled
cavities. Each cavity consists of a two-level system (de-
scribing the atom or the junction) coupled to a unique
mode of the cavity. The cavities are then coupled by
tunneling of photons from one cavity to the next. In this
many-cavity system, it was predicted that a phenomenon
similar to a photon blockade [6] would take place, lead-
ing to a phase transition transition between a coherent
state, where all the cavities are in phase, and an incoher-
ent state where the number of excitations per cavity is
quantized, reminiscent of the Mott-superﬂuid transition
observed in the bosonic Hubbard model [7–11].

In the JCH model description of such a system, the to-
tal number of excitons, N , the sum of the number of pho-
tons Nl and of excited atoms (also referred to as spins)
Ns, is a conserved quantity. However, a complete de-
scription of the interaction between the two-level system
and the photons’ ﬁeld should include, as described by the
Rabi Hamiltonian [12], so-called counter-rotating (CR)
terms that do not conserve the number of excitations.
Neglecting these terms, which is generally called the ro-
tating wave approximation (RWA), is generally valid due
to the very small values of the coupling g between the
ﬁeld and the material device. Compared to the energy
of a photon ωl, g generally ranges from g/ωl ≃ 10−7 in
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments up
to g/ωl ≃ 10−3 in circuit QED [2].
However, it was recently remarked that, for larger val-
ues of g, these CR terms may modify deeply the physics
of these systems [13–15]. In [13], Schiro et al. introduced
the Rabi-Hubbard (RH) model, which is equivalent to the

JCH model with the addition of counter-rotating terms.
This model has diﬀerent symmetry properties from the
JCH model and consequently diﬀerent transitions. The
mean-ﬁeld study performed in [13, 14] shows that it does
not exhibit Mott insulating behavior, but rather an in-
coherent/coherent transition which resembles the super-
radiant transition of the Dicke model [16]. Recent ex-
periments also show the breakdown of the RWA approx-
imation by reaching an ultra strong coupling regime in
circuit QED [17, 18] where g/ωl ≃ 10−1.
In order to address the discrepancies between the RH
and JCH descriptions of such systems, we will use ex-
act quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Whereas
the JCH model has been studied with DMRG [9] tech-
niques that are essentially exact, the RH model has so far
only been studied with mean-ﬁeld approximations. Some
QMC methods are able to tackle the changing number of
excitations of the model and the associated large phase
space. Obtaining exact results for these two models will
allow us to compare them and better understand the role
of the counter-rotating terms in modifying qualitatively
the physics of the system and its phase diagram.

In Section II, we review the model, the technique used
to simulate it and the physical quantities of interest for
this study. In Section III, we present the phase diagram
of the model and compare it with previously known re-
sults, focusing on the case where the detuning is zero. In
Section IV, we discuss in more detail the importance of
the counter-rotating terms and their eﬀects.

II. MODELS AND TECHNIQUES

We study the Rabi-Hubbard model on a one-
dimensional periodic chain with L sites. Each site of
the chain, labelled with index i, represents a cavity (Fig.
1). In each cavity there is a two-level atom represented
as a spin-1/2 and we consider only one photon mode per
cavity. The atom is coupled to the mode with the Rabi-
Hamiltonian [12]. The sites are coupled to each other by

a photon hopping term connecting near neighbor cavities
via the tunnel eﬀect. The Rabi-Hubbard (RH) Hamilto-
nian governing this system is [13]

The ai(a†

tons in the i-th cavity. The σi operators describe the
two-level atoms. The ﬁrst term in Eq.(1) describes the
hopping of photons between cavities; the second term,
which is diagonal, describes the energies of the photons
and the excited atomic states. The third term describes
the exchange between the atom and the photons ﬁeld.

Written in this

the Hamiltonian includes
counter-rotating terms (CR): terms which create two
photons (a†
i+1) in the ﬁrst line of Eq.(1) or which simul-
taneously excite a spin and create a photon (σ+
i ) in the
third, and their Hermitian conjugates. This last term is
often neglected in the treatment of the Rabi model as it
couples states with diﬀerent diagonal energies. The non-
rotating terms in the hopping part of the Hamiltonian
are probably not physical but were studied in [13] and
allow us to study the eﬀects of two diﬀerent non rotating
terms. Ignoring these terms in Eq.(1), what is generally
called the rotating wave approximation (RWA), trans-
forms the model
into the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard
(JCH) Hamiltonian [5]. There is an important qualita-
tive diﬀerence between these models. The JCH model
conserves the number of excitations N = Ns + Nl and
has U(1) symmetry whereas the RH model does not have
such a conservation law and has a simpler Z2 symmetry.
To study the diﬀerences between the JCH and RH
models, we perform exact numerical simulations us-
ing the SGF quantum Monte Carlo algorithm [19, 20].
This numerical technique is able to tackle the non-
conservation of the number of excitations and the large
number of photons present in the RH model. This al-
lowed us the study its phase diagram and simulate sizes
up to L = 30 sites and inverse temperatures βωl ≃ 20.
We chose to study a one dimensional lattice where results
can easily be compared with DMRG studies of the JCH
model [9] and because of the limited number of sites we
can study. To study in more details the eﬀects of the CR
terms, we generalize slightly the forms of the parameters
g and J. The hopping term will then be replaced with

where we introduce separate parameters for the rotating
and counter-rotating terms (gr, Jr and gcr, Jcr, respec-

We measure the number of photons Nl or the total

III. PHASES AND PHASE DIAGRAM AT δ = 0

We start with the Rabi-Hubbard model at δ = 0 and
with: gr = gcr = g and Jr = Jcr = J. We take ωl =
ωs = 1 to ﬁx the energy scale and we study the phase
diagram as J/ωl is varied for a ﬁxed value of g.

We observed, as predicted in [13], that the system un-
dergoes an evolution from an incoherent photon ﬁeld, at
low J, to a completely coherent ﬁeld at large values of
J (Fig. 2). The value of Cl is not zero for small J but
we observe that all the Green functions (see Fig. 3, left)
decrease exponentially in this phase. We will show that
this non-zero Cl is only a ﬁnite size eﬀect.

A striking feature is that Cl almost reaches its satu-
ration value of unity for large J indicating that all the
photons are condensed. This is atypical in one dimen-
sion, where one usually encounters quasi-condensation of
the photons.
In the present case, the condensation is
due to the discrete Z2 symmetry of the RH model. This

is also visible in the behavior of the Green functions in
the coherent phase (Fig. 3, right) where all the Green
functions reach plateaux with constant values at large
distances, instead of the power law decay generally ob-
served in one dimension. Another important feature is
that we observe only the two phases, incoherent and co-
herent photon phases, with no sign of any Mott insulator
where Cl would be zero for commensurate densities. This
result conﬁrms the mean ﬁeld analysis of [13].

for the spin-spin correlations (Fig. 3) which tend to their

FIG. 2: (Color online) Condensate fraction Cl (Eq.(6)) of the
photons as a function of J/ωl for detuning δ = 0. The system
undergoes a phase transition from an incoherent ﬁeld to a
coherent ﬁeld as the coupling J.

The spin-spin correlations follow the behavior of the
condensate fraction (Fig. 4): as the photons become
coherent, the spins couple to the photon ﬁeld and become

FIG. 4: (Color online) Spin-spin correlations Cs (Eq.(8)) at
the maximum distance R = L/2 as a function of J/ωl for
detuning δ = 0 and for diﬀerent sizes. As the photons become
coherent (see Fig. 2), the system becomes “ferromagnetic”.

To determine more precisely the transition point be-
tween the incoherent and coherent phases, we perform
ﬁnite size scaling analysis [21]. This one-dimensional
system has discrete Z2 symmetry and, consequently, its
ground state quantum phase transitions belong to the
classical two-dimensional Ising model universality class.

The order parameter is hai = √Cl (or, equivalently, the

magnetization of the spin along the x-axis). At the crit-
ical point, we expect the order parameter to scale like
L−βc/νc where βc = 1/8 and νc = 1 are the critical ex-
ponents. Hence, ClL2βc/νc is independent of L at the
transition which allows us to determine the critical point
Jc with good precision (Fig. 5).
In addition, we ob-
serve the collapse of curves for diﬀerent system sizes in
the critical region by using the rescaled transition pa-
rameter (J − Jc)L1/νc (Fig. 6). Performing such analysis
for many diﬀerent values of g allows us to determine the
transition line between incoherent and coherent regions
in the (J/ωl, g/ωl) plane.

a universal crossing of the curves. Inset: Zoom on the tran-
sition region. For this value of g, the transition is located
around Jc/ωl ≃ 0.062.

We now analyse the coherent region by doing a sim-
pliﬁed mean-ﬁeld (MF) analysis: we replace all photon
operators ai (a†
i ) by one c-number φ (φ⋆). This is a sim-
ple coherent state approach that should be valid in the
coherent phase when the photon number is large enough
to neglect ﬂuctuations. Our problem is then reduced to
simple one-site MF Hamiltonians H MF

dependent spins coupled to the same perfectly coherent

This reduces to nl ≃ g2/(ωl − 2Jr − 2Jcr)2 for φ ≫ 1
where the approximation should be valid. The number
of photons will then diverge for wl = 2(Jr + Jcr) and
the system becomes unstable for wl smaller than this
limit. Such instabilities are observed in photonic systems,
for example in [10], when the chemical potential is large
enough. Since ωl plays the role of a chemical potential
in our system and as the number of excitations is not
conserved, it is reasonable to ﬁnd such a stability limit.
We used our QMC simulations to study the divergence
of the number of photons as the instability point is ap-
proached, Fig. 7. We observe that nl follows the MF
result for the larger values of the photon density, which
is expected since our approximation is not valid for small
densities. It is very diﬃcult numerically to get closer to
the divergence point because the QMC becomes ineﬃ-
cient when there is a very large number of photons on
a site (typically more than ten or twenty photons per
site). However, there is always a region where the MF
behaviour is observed which conﬁrms that the system is
unstable below a given value of ωl (4J in the case of Fig.
7).

As mentioned above, the ﬁnite size scaling analysis we
performed for diﬀerent values of g, allows us to deter-
mine the phase diagram in the (J/ωl, g/ωl) plane which
we show in Fig. 8. We also redid the mean ﬁeld cal-
culation of Ref.[14] in order to compare with our exact
QMC results. The MF results obtained in [13, 14] pro-
vide a qualitatively correct description of the transition
line throughout the phase diagram. On the other hand,
the simple ansatz Eq.(10) only works well for large J.

The absence of Mott insulating phases when the CR
terms are taken into account, predicted in [14], is then
also observed with our QMC simulations. However the
model used so far [14] introduces unusual CR hopping,
the Jcr term in Eq.(2). In order to investigate the eﬀect of

terms that are large enough, whether in the hopping term
or in the exchange term between the spins and photons, we
recover qualitatively the same diagram with only two phases

simple expression Eq.(10).

this term, we determined the phase diagram with (Jr 6=
0, Jcr = 0) while maintaining the CR term in the on-site
exchange (gr = gcr = g). We ﬁnd a qualitatively similar
phase diagram shown in Fig. 9. This demonstrates that,
when the counter-rotating term is large enough, be it in
the hopping or the exchange terms, the Mott insulating
phases are suppressed. This can be understood by noting
that the CR terms couple states with diﬀerent numbers of
excitations and, consequently, forbid the photon blockade

In the preceding section, we focused on the case with
zero detuning, and found that the CR terms played a
major role in the physics of our system and could not be
neglected. This was expected as the values of g we used
are large (g ≃ ωl). We will now study cases where the
detuning, δ, is non zero or where gcr is smaller than gr to
see if CR terms play an important part in these cases too.
To simplify our study we will keep only the on-site CR
term and set Jcr = 0. We will use the MF approximation
that was used in [14], as it provides qualitatively correct
results, as well as QMC.

We start by comparing the MF phase diagrams of the
JCH and RH models at zero detuning, Fig. 10, in the
(J/g, (µ − ωl)/g) plane, where µ is the chemical poten-
tial. For the JCH model gcr = 0, g = gr and we vary
µ − ωl which acts as the eﬀective chemical potential for
the photons in the grand canonical ensemble. For the
RH model gr = gcr = g and we tune ωl, setting µ = 0.
The notion of canonical or grand canonical ensemble is
not really pertinent for the RH model as the number of
excitations is not a conserved quantity. As mentioned
before, the models have very diﬀerent phase diagrams. If
we introduce positive detuning, δ > 0, that is if ωs > ωl,
we favor photon over spin excitations and this leads to
similar diﬀerences between the two models as we encoun-
tered for δ = 0.

However, if we introduce negative detuning δ < 0, the
physics of the two models becomes equivalent, as shown
in Fig. 11. In both models, we observe a region with no
excitations, a Mott insulator phase for n = 1. However,
we did not observe Mott phase at n = 2. As |δ| becomes
larger (but always negative), the two phase diagrams be-
come more similar. To conﬁrm this MF prediction, we
show some QMC cuts in the phase diagram for negative
detuning in Fig. 12. We observe the similarity of the
behavior in this case with the n = 1 Mott plateau visible
in the JCH and the RH model, with similar width and
the absence of a visible n = 2 plateau. We then conclude
that, for large values of g, the counter-rotating terms can
be neglected only if there is a negative detuning that is
large enough to overcome the coupling between states
with diﬀerent densities of excitations.

V. CONCLUSION

We studied the Rabi-Hubbard model and compared it
with the Jaynes-Cummings model to see how the pres-
ence of counter-rotating terms, that involve ﬂuctuations
of the number of photons, changes the physics of said
models.

For zero detuning, we observed that for large values
of the counter-rotating terms, be they in the hopping

FIG. 10: (Color online) The MF phase diagrams of the RH
and JCH models for δ = 0 at zero temperature. The phase
diagrams are very diﬀerent due to the degeneracy of the spin
and photon energies. The JCH model shows several Mott
insulator (MI) phases with diﬀerent densities n, whereas the
RH model only shows its incoherent/coherent transition.

We now consider directly the eﬀects of the counter-
rotating term by tuning the value of gcr keeping the
other parameters ﬁxed. We will use the zero detuned
case (see Fig. 13). As expected, we ﬁnd that for small
values, gcr/gr = 0.01, the RH model gives results that
are similar to the JCH model (treated in the canonical
or grand canonical ensemble). However for gcr/gr = 0.1,
the CR terms already have a strong eﬀect and modify
the physics by destroying the n = 1 Mott phase. We see,
then, that the physics is very sensitive to the addition of
small counter-rotating terms since, even with gcr an or-
der of magnitude smaller than gr, we obtain a profound
modiﬁcation of the phase diagram.

FIG. 13: (Color online) Number of excitations n as a function
of ωl for diﬀerent values of gcr and ﬁxed Jr and gr, for the
Jaynes-Cummings and Rabi-Hubbard models. We see that
the two models give similar results for gcr/gr = 0.01 but that
the Mott plateau is destroyed even for gcr/gr = 0.1.

or on-site terms, the physics of the two models is com-
pletely diﬀerent as the Mott phases present in the Jaynes-
Cummings are destroyed in the RH model. We also ob-
served that, due the discrete Z2 symmetry of the RH
model, there is a transition between an incoherent phase
and phase with true long range coherence, and we identi-
ﬁed an unstable region in parameter space. These results
are in good qualitative agreement with the MF results
previously obtained by Schiro et al. [13, 14].

Exploring further, we identiﬁed two ways in which the
eﬀects of the counter-rotating terms can be reduced: by

introducing a negative detuning or by directly making the
counter-rotating parameter gcr smaller.
In both cases,
the physics of the RH model approaches that of the JCH
model.

By using arbitrarily large values of the counter-rotating
terms, we depart from most experimental systems that
have very small g parameters and are generally well de-
scribed by the JCH model. Even rather small values of g
can have a big impact on the phase diagrams, as is also
observed in ultra strong coupling experiments [17, 18].

Another important eﬀect in experiments is the pres-
ence of dissipative terms:
losses from the cavity and
gains to compensate those. To obtain a strong coupling
regime between the two-state system and the photons,
these terms are generally small compared to g. However
the system is driven out of equilibrium because of such
eﬀects.

Whereas we expect a Bose-Einstein condensation of
photons at equilibrium, when the system is out of equi-
librium, we expect phase coherence to appear through
a lasing eﬀect. The question of the diﬀerence between
a laser and a Bose-Einstein condensate for photons is
the subject of current debate [22], with the suggestion
that there is a crossover between these two forms of co-
herent states. The QMC technique we use does not al-
low to study non Hermitian Hamiltonians but, including
gain/loss terms that are Hermitian conjugates, we can
address this question.
