Topological cell clustering in the ATLAS calorimeters and its

performance in LHC Run 1

The ATLAS Collaboration

Abstract

The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton–proton col-
lisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based
on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The
cluster formation follows cell signal-signiﬁcance patterns generated by electromagnetic and
hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise
suppression by removing cells with insigniﬁcant signals which are not in close proximity to
cells with signiﬁcant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location
information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending
on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing
calorimeter signal deﬁnition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in AT-
LAS.

The detectable ﬁnal state emerging from the proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
consists of particles and jets which are reconstructed with high precision for physics analyses. In the
ATLAS experiment [1], clusters of topologically connected calorimeter cell signals (topo-clusters) are
employed as a principal signal deﬁnition for use in the reconstruction of the (hadronic) part of the ﬁnal
state comprising isolated hadrons, jets and hadronically decaying τ-leptons. In addition, topo-clusters
are also used to represent the energy ﬂow from softer particles, which is needed for the reconstruction of
full-event observables such as the missing transverse momentum.

The algorithm building the topo-clusters explores the spatial distribution of the cell signals in all three
dimensions to establish connections between neighbours in an attempt to reconstruct the energy and
directions of the incoming particles. The signals from cells determined to be connected are summed,
and are used together with the cell locations to calculate direction, location, and shapes of the resulting
clusters. Calorimeter cells with insigniﬁcant signals found to not be connected to neighbouring cells with
signiﬁcant signals are considered noise and discarded from further jet, particle and missing transverse
momentum reconstruction.

The topo-clusters, while well established in deep inelastic scattering experiments such as H1 [2] at HERA
and in electron–positron collider experiments such as ALEPH [3] at LEP and BaBar [4] at PEP-II, are used
here in an innovative implementation as fully calibrated three-dimensional objects representing the calo-
rimeter signals in the complex ﬁnal-state environment of hadron–hadron collisions. A similar application
in this particular environment, previously developed by the D0 Collaboration, implements the topologic-
ally clustering in the two dimensions spanned by pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle, thus applying
the noise-suppression strategy inherent in this algorithm for jet reconstruction [5]. Several features and
aspects of the ATLAS topo-cluster algorithms and their validations have previously been presented in
Refs. [6–9].

Some of the complexity of the ﬁnal state in hadron–hadron collisions is introduced by particles from
the underlying event generated by radiation and multiple parton interactions in the two colliding hadrons
producing the hard-scatter ﬁnal state. Other detector signal contributions from the collision environment,
especially important for higher intensity operations at the LHC, arise from pile-up generated by dif-
fuse particle emissions produced by the additional proton–proton collisions occurring in the same bunch
crossing as the hard-scatter interaction (in-time pile-up). Further pile-up inﬂuences on the signal are from
signal remnants from the energy ﬂow in other bunch crossings in the ATLAS calorimeters (out-of-time
pile-up).

This paper ﬁrst describes the ATLAS detector in Sect. 2, together with the datasets used for the perform-
ance evaluations. The motivations and basic implementation of the topo-cluster algorithm are presented
in Sect. 3. The computation of additional variables associated with topo-clusters including geometric and
signal moments is described in Sect. 4. The local hadronic calibration (LCW) strategies are presented in
Sect. 5. Section 6 summarises the performance of the topo-cluster signal in the reconstruction of isolated
hadrons and jets produced in the proton–proton collisions at LHC. Performance evaluations with and
without pile-up are discussed in this section, together with results from the corresponding Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations. The paper concludes with a summary and outlook in Sect. 7.

2 The ATLAS experiment

In this section the basic systems forming the ATLAS detector are described in Sect. 2.1, followed in
Sect. 2.2 by a description of the datasets considered in this paper and the corresponding run conditions in
data. The MC simulation setup for ﬁnal-state generation and the simulation of the calorimeter response
to the incident particles is described in Sect. 2.3.

2.1 The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment features a multi-purpose detector system with a forward–backward symmetric
cylindrical geometry. It provides nearly complete and hermetic coverage of the solid angle around the
proton–proton collisions at the LHC. A detailed description of the ATLAS experiment can be found in
Ref. [1].

2.1.1 The ATLAS detector systems

The detector closest to the proton–proton collision vertex is the inner tracking detector (ID). It has com-
plete azimuthal coverage and spans the pseudorapidity1 region |η| < 2.5. It consists of a silicon pixel
detector, a silicon micro-strip detector, and a straw-tube transition radiation tracking detector covering
|η| < 2. The ID is immersed into a uniform axial magnetic ﬁeld of 2 T provided by a thin superconducting
solenoid magnet.

1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector
and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points
upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, φ) are used in the transverse plane, φ being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.
The pseudorapidity is deﬁned in terms of the polar angle θ as η = − ln tan(θ/2).

Figure 1: Cutaway view on the ATLAS calorimeter system.

The ATLAS calorimeter system is illustrated in Fig. 1. It comprises several calorimeters with various
read-out granularities and with diﬀerent technologies. The electromagnetic calorimeter (EM) surrounding
the ID is a high-granularity liquid-argon sampling calorimeter (LAr), using lead as an absorber. It is
divided into one barrel (EMB; |η| < 1.475) and two end-cap (EMEC; 1.375 < |η| < 3.2) regions.
The barrel and end-cap regions also feature pre-samplers mounted between the cryostat cold wall and
the calorimeter modules. The barrel pre-sampler (PreSamplerB) covers |η| < 1.52, while the end-cap
pre-sampler (PreSamplerE) covers 1.5 < |η| < 1.8.
The hadronic calorimeters are divided into three distinct sections. The most central section contains the
central barrel region (|η| < 0.8) and two extended barrel regions (0.8 < |η| < 1.7). These regions are
instrumented with scintillator-tile/steel hadronic calorimeters (Tile). Each barrel region consists of 64
modules with individual azimuthal (φ) coverages of π/32 rad. The two hadronic end-cap calorimeters
(HEC; 1.5 < |η| < 3.2) feature liquid-argon/copper calorimeter modules. The two forward calorimeters
(FCAL; 3.1 < |η| < 4.9) are instrumented with liquid-argon/copper and liquid-argon/tungsten modules for
electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements, respectively.

The ATLAS calorimeters have a highly granular lateral and longitudinal segmentation. Including the pre-
samplers, there are seven sampling layers in the combined central calorimeters (PreSamplerB, three in
EMB and three in Tile) and eight sampling layers in the end-cap region (PreSamplerE, three in EMEC and
four in HEC). The three FCAL modules provide three sampling layers in the forward region. Altogether,
the calorimeter system has about 188 000 read-out channels. The combined depth of the calorimeters
for hadronic energy measurements is more than 10 hadronic interaction lengths (λ) nearly everywhere
across the full detector acceptance (|η| ≤ 4.9). Their absorption power and segmentation allow for very

5

precise energy-ﬂow reconstruction based on the topo-clusters described in this paper, with considerable
exploitation of the topo-cluster shapes for signal calibration purposes. For more details of the calorimeter
read-out structures, absorption characteristics, and cell signal formation, see Ref. [1]. The segmentation
of the read-out structure in the various calorimeter sampling layers, each named by a dedicated identiﬁer
(S calo), is shown in Table 1.
The muon spectrometer surrounds the ATLAS calorimeters. A system of three large air-core toroids, a
barrel and two end-caps with eight coils each, generates a magnetic ﬁeld in the pseudorapidity range of
|η| < 2.7. The muon spectrometer measures the full momentum of muons based on their tracks recon-
structed with three layers of precision tracking chambers in the toroidal ﬁeld. It is also instrumented with
separate trigger chambers.

2.1.2 The ATLAS trigger

The trigger system for the ATLAS detector in Run 1 consisted of a hardware-based Level 1 (L1) trigger
and a software-based High Level Trigger (HLT) [10]. For the evaluation of the topo-cluster reconstruction
performance, samples of minimum-bias (MB) triggered events, samples of events selected by jet triggers,
and samples of events with hard objects such as muons, which are not triggered by the calorimeter, are
useful.
The ATLAS MB trigger [11] used signals from a dedicated system of scintillators (MBTS [12]; 2.1 < |η| <
3.8) at L1 in 2010 and 2011 data-taking. Depending on the run period, it required one hit in either of the
η hemispheres, or one hit in each η hemisphere. In 2012, the MB samples were triggered by a zero-bias
trigger. This trigger unconditionally accepted events from bunch crossings occurring a ﬁxed number of
LHC cycles after a high-energy electron or photon was accepted by the L1 trigger. The L1 trigger rate
for these hard objects scales linearly with luminosity, thus the collision environment generated by the
luminosity-dependent additional proton–proton interactions discussed in Sect. 2.2.1 is well reﬂected in
the MB samples.

For triggering on collision events with jets at L1, jets are ﬁrst built from coarse-granularity calorimeter
towers using a sliding-window algorithm (L1-jets). The events are accepted if they have L1-jets passing
triggers based on (1) the transverse momentum (pT) of individual L1-jets (single-jet triggers) or on (2) the
detection of several such jets at increasing transverse momenta (multi-jet triggers). Those events accepted
by L1 are then subjected to reﬁned jet-trigger decisions based on jet pT and multi-jet topology in the HLT,
now using jets that are reconstructed from calorimeter cell signals with algorithms similar to the ones
applied in the oﬄine precision reconstruction [13].

A Z boson sample is collected from muon triggers at L1. Since the trigger rate and the reconstruction
of the decay properties of the accepted Z → µµ events are basically unaﬀected by pile-up, this sample is
not only unbiased in this respect but also with respect to other possible biases introduced by the ATLAS
calorimeter signals.

2.2 Dataset

The data used for the evaluation of the topo-cluster reconstruction performance are selected from proton–
proton collision events at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 7 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector
in 2010, and at √s = 8 TeV in 2012. The overall amount of high-quality data recorded at those times

corresponds to ∼45 pb−1 in 2010, and ∼20.3 fb−1 in 2012. Peak instantaneous luminosities reached in the
ﬁrst three years of LHC running (LHC Run 1) are shown in Fig. 2(a). Some early data recorded during the
very ﬁrst proton–proton collisions in the LHC in 2009 are considered for the studies of the topo-cluster
reconstruction performance as well. The corresponding events are extracted from approximately 540 000
proton–proton collisions at √s = 900 GeV, recorded during stable beam conditions and corresponding
to about 12 mb−1. Occasional references to 2011 run conditions, where protons collided in the LHC
with √s = 7 TeV and ATLAS collected data corresponding to ∼ 5.1 fb−1, are provided to illustrate the

evolution of the operational conditions during LHC Run 1 relevant to topo-cluster reconstruction. The
speciﬁc choice of 2010 and 2012 data for the performance evaluations encompasses the most important
scenarios with the lowest and highest luminosity operation, respectively.

The unipolar triangular pulse is the current pulse in the
liquid argon generated by fast ionising particles. Its characteristic time is the drift time (charge collection time) td,
with td ≈ 450 ns in the example for the central EMB calorimeter shown here. The shaped pulse is superimposed,
with a characteristic duration of τsignal ≈ 600 ns. The full circles on the shaped pulse indicate the nominal bunch
crossings at 25 ns intervals. The ﬁgure has been adapted from Ref. [14].

2.2.1 Pile-up in data

One important aspect of the contribution from additional proton–proton interactions (pile-up) to the calo-
rimeter signal in data is the sensitivity of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters to this pile-up as a function
of the instantaneous luminosity, and as a function of the signal history from previous bunch crossings.

In the initial phase of data-taking in 2010 the proton beam intensities at LHC were relatively low. The
recorded events contain on average three additional proton–proton interactions, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In
addition, the initial bunch crossing interval of tBX = 750 ns was larger than the window of sensitivity of
the LAr calorimeter, which is deﬁned by the duration τsignal of the shaped signal, with τsignal ≈ 600 ns, as
depicted in Fig. 3 for the typical charge collection time of td = 450 ns in this detector. In later data-taking
periods in 2010 the bunch crossing interval was reduced to tBX = 175 ns, which is within the sensitivity of
the LAr calorimeter signal formation (tBX < τsignal). Nevertheless, the still-low instantaneous luminosity
reduced the amount of energy scattered into the calorimeter in the other bunch crossings to a negligible
contribution with little eﬀect on the signal history.

Throughout operations in 2011 and 2012, the proton beam intensities in the LHC were signiﬁcantly in-
creased, leading to the corresponding increases in the number of pile-up interactions per bunch crossing
shown in Fig. 2(b). At the same time, tBX was reduced to 50 ns. These two changes in the run conditions
introduced a sensitivity of the LAr calorimeter signal to the signal residuals from proton–proton interac-
tions occurring in NPU
BX ≈ 12 preceding bunch crossings at the LHC (out-of-time pile-up), in addition to
pile-up interactions in the current bunch crossing (in-time pile-up). The out-of-time pile-up eﬀect on the
cell signal depends on NPU
The bipolar shape of the LAr calorimeter signal shown in Fig. 3 reduces the overall eﬀect of pile-up,
because it features a net-zero integral over time. This leads to cancellation on average of in-time pile-up

BX ≈ τsignal/tBX and the energy deposited in each of the NPU

BX bunch crossings.

the shaping ampliﬁer, and the choice of a 40 MHz digital sampling frequency of the shaped pulse in the
read-out, the most eﬃcient suppression is achieved for 25 ns bunch spacing in the LHC beams. It is fully
eﬀective in the limit where for each bunch crossing contributing to out-of-time pile-up about the same
amount of energy is deposited in a given calorimeter cell. A small loss of eﬃciency is observed for 50 ns
bunch spacing, due to the less frequent injection of energy by the fewer previous bunch crossings.

Approximately the ﬁrst ten bunch crossings in each LHC bunch train at 50 ns bunch spacing are charac-
terised by diﬀerent out-of-time pile-up contributions from the collision history. This history gets ﬁlled
with signal remnants from an increasing number of bunch crossings with proton–proton interactions the
further the distance of the bunch crossing is from the beginning of the train. The remaining bunch cross-
ings in a train, about 26 of a total of 36 in 2011 and 62 of a total of 72 in 2012, have an out-of-time pile-up
signal contribution which is stable within the bunch-to-bunch ﬂuctuations in the beam intensity. In 2012
data a dedicated cell-by-cell correction is applied in the oﬄine cell signal reconstruction to compensate
for the corresponding variations in the out-of-time pile-up. Further details of the ATLAS liquid-argon
calorimeter read-out and signal processing can be found in Ref. [15].

Even with a constant proton bunch intensity and apart from the bunch train eﬀects, the eﬃciency of
pile-up suppression by signal shaping is reduced by the large ﬂuctuations in the number of additional
interactions from bunch crossing to bunch crossing, and by the diﬀerent energy-ﬂow patterns of the in-
dividual collisions in the time window of sensitivity τsignal in the LAr calorimeters. Consequently, the
signal shows a principal sensitivity to pile-up, even after shaping and digital ﬁltering in the read-out. This
is evident from a residual non-zero cell-signal baseline dependent on the pile-up conditions. This baseline
can lead to relevant signal oﬀsets once the noise suppression is applied, which is an important part of the
calorimeter signal extraction strategy using topo-clusters presented in Sect. 3.

The Tile calorimeter shows very little sensitivity to pile-up since most of the associated (soft particle)
energy ﬂow is absorbed in the LAr calorimeters in front of it. Moreover, out-of-time pile-up is suppressed
by a shorter signal collection time and a short pulse shaping time, reducing the sensitivity of the signal to
only about three bunch crossings at 50 ns intervals [12].

2.2.2 Eﬀect on calorimeter noise

In ATLAS operations prior to 2011 the cell noise was dominated by electronic noise. The short bunch
crossing interval and higher instantaneous luminosity in 2011 and 2012 LHC running added additional
and dominant noise contributions introduced by pile-up and generated by the ﬂuctuations of the in-
stantaneous luminosity and the energy ﬂow patterns from bunch crossing to bunch crossing discussed
in Sect. 2.2.1. The cell noise thresholds steering the topo-cluster formation described in Sect. 3 thus
needed to be increased from those used in 2010 to accommodate the corresponding ﬂuctuations. This is
done by using the nominal energy-equivalent noise σnoise according to

The change of the total nominal noise σnoise and its dependence on the calorimeter region in ATLAS
can be seen by comparing Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c). In most calorimeter regions, the total noise rises
signiﬁcantly above the electronic noise with increasing pile-up activity, as expected. This increase is

2.3 Monte Carlo simulations

The energy and direction of particles produced in proton–proton collisions are simulated using various
MC event generators. An overview of these generators for LHC physics can be found in Ref. [17]. The
samples for comparisons to 2010 data are produced at √s = 7 TeV, while the MC samples for 2012
analysis are generated at √s = 8 TeV. Some conﬁguration details for the inclusive jet and inclusive Z
boson MC samples and the simulated MB samples are given below.

2.3.1 Monte Carlo simulations of signal samples

Simulated signal samples include inclusive jet-production, which is generated using Pythia [18] version
6.425 for 2010 analyses, and Pythia8 [19] version 8.160 for 2012 analysis. Both generators model the
hard sub-process in the ﬁnal states of the generated proton–proton collisions using a 2→2 matrix element

Additional radiation is modelled in the leading-logarithmic
(LL) approximation by pT-ordered parton showers [20]. Multiple parton interactions (MPI) [21], as well
as fragmentation and hadronisation based on the Lund string model [22], are also generated.
For comparisons with 2012 data, samples of Z bosons with Z → µµ are generated. The next-to-leading-
order (NLO) POWHEG [23,24] model is used, with the ﬁnal-state partons showered by Pythia8 using the
CT10 NLO parton distribution function (PDF) [25] and the ATLAS AU2 [26] set of tuned parton shower
and other soft underlying event generation parameters. Pythia8 also provides the MPI, fragmentation and
hadronisation for these events.

2.3.2 Minimum-bias samples and pile-up modelling

The MB samples for 2012 running conditions are generated using Pythia8 with the ATLAS AM2 [26]
set of tuned soft interaction parameters and the MSTW2008LO PDF set [27]. A single, fully simulated
event for that run year is built by overlaying a number NPU of generated MB events onto one generated
hard-scatter event. The actual NPU is drawn from a Poisson distribution around the average number (cid:104)µ(cid:105) of
additional proton–proton collisions per bunch crossing. The value of (cid:104)µ(cid:105) is measured by the experiment as
an average over one luminosity block, which can last as long as two minutes [28], with its actual duration
depending on the central data acquisition conﬁguration at the time of the data-taking. The distribution of
the measured (cid:104)µ(cid:105) over the whole run period is taken into account in this procedure.
The LHC bunch train structure with 72 proton bunches per train and 50 ns spacing between the bunches
in 2012, is also modelled by organising the simulated collisions into four such trains. This allows the
inclusion of out-of-time pile-up eﬀects driven by the distance of the hard-scatter events from the beginning
of the bunch train, as discussed in Sect. 2.2.1. A correction depending on the bunch position in the train is
applied to data and MC simulations to mitigate these eﬀects. Bunch-to-bunch intensity ﬂuctuations in the
LHC are not included in the MC modelling. These are corrected in the data by the correction depending
on the position of the bunch in the train.

2.3.3 Minimum-bias overlay samples for 2012

In addition to the fully generated and simulated MC samples described earlier, samples with events mixing
data and MC simulations are used to study the topo-cluster reconstruction performance. These samples
are produced by overlaying one event from the MB samples collected by the zero-bias trigger described
in Sect. 2.1.2 and a hard-scatter interaction from the MC generator [29–31]. The generated hard-scatter
event is simulated using the detector simulation described in Sect. 2.3.4. The recorded and simulated raw
electronic signals are then overlaid prior to the digitisation step in the simulation. This results in modelling
both the detector noise and the eﬀect of pile-up from data with the correct experimental conditions on
top of the simulated event. Theses samples are useful for detailed comparisons of topo-cluster signal
features in 2012, as they do not depend on limitations in the soft-event modelling introduced by any of
the generators.

2.3.4 Detector simulation

The Geant4 software toolkit [32] within the ATLAS simulation framework [33] propagates the stable
particles2 produced by the event generators through the ATLAS detector and simulates their interactions
with the detector material and the signal formation. Hadronic showers are simulated with the quark-
gluon-string-plasma model employing a quark–gluon string model [34] at high energies and the Bertini
intra-nuclear cascade model [35–37] at low energies (QGSP_BERT). There are diﬀerences between the
detector simulation used in 2010 and in 2012. A newer version of Geant4 (version 9.4) is employed in
2012, together with a more detailed description of the LAr calorimeter absorber structure. These geometry
changes introduce an increase of about 2% in the calorimeter response to pions with energies of less than
10 GeV.

2.4 Hadronic ﬁnal-state reconstruction in ATLAS

The fully reconstructed ﬁnal state of the proton–proton collisions in ATLAS includes identiﬁed individual
particles comprising electrons, photons, muons, and τ-leptons, in addition to jets and missing transverse
momentum (Emiss
). Calorimeter signals contribute to all objects, except for muons. The topo-clusters
introduced in detail in Sect. 3 are primarily used for the reconstruction of isolated hadrons, jets and
Emiss
T

T

.

Jets are reconstructed using topo-clusters, with their energies either reconstructed on the basic (electro-
magnetic) scale presented in Sect. 3.2, or on the fully calibrated and corrected (hadronic) scale described
in Sect. 5.

Additional reﬁnement of the jet energy scale (JES) may include reconstructed charged-particle tracks
from the ID. More details of jet reconstruction and calibration can be found in Refs. [16, 38].

Jets used in the studies presented here are reconstructed in data and MC simulations using the anti-kt jet
algorithm [39] as implemented in the FastJet package [40]. The jet size is deﬁned by the radius parameter
R in the jet algorithm, where both R = 0.4 and R = 0.6 are used. Full four-momentum recombination is
used, restricting the input topo-cluster signals to be positive for a meaningful jet formation. The jets are
fully calibrated and corrected after formation, including a correction for pile-up signal contributions. For
2012, the pile-up correction employs the reconstructed median transverse momentum density in the event
and the area of the jet to subtract the pT contribution from pile-up, following the suggestions in Ref. [41].
In addition, an MC simulation-based residual correction is applied [42].

3 Topological cluster formation and features

The collection of the calorimeter signals of a given collision event into clusters of topologically connected
cell signals is an attempt to extract the signiﬁcant signal from a background of electronic noise and other
sources of ﬂuctuations such as pile-up. This strategy is most eﬀective in a highly granular calorimeter
system such as the one employed by ATLAS. Finely segmented lateral read-out together with longitudinal
sampling layers allows the resolution of energy-ﬂow structures generating these spatial signal patterns,

2 Stable particles are those with laboratory frame lifetimes τ deﬁned by cτ > 10 mm.

thus retaining only signals important for particle and jet reconstruction while eﬃciently removing insig-
niﬁcant signals induced by noise. The signal extraction is guided by reconstructing three-dimensional
“energy blobs" from particle showers in the active calorimeter volume. Individual topo-clusters are not
solely expected to contain the entire response to a single particle all of the time. Rather, depending on the
incoming particle types, energies, spatial separations and cell signal formation, individual topo-clusters
represent the full or fractional response to a single particle (full shower or shower fragment), the merged
response of several particles, or a combination of merged full and partial showers.

3.1 Topo-cluster formation

The collection of calorimeter cell signals into topo-clusters follows spatial signal-signiﬁcance patterns
generated by particle showers. The basic observable controlling this cluster formation is the cell signal
signiﬁcance ς EM
in this cell, as estimated for each run year according to Eq. (1) (with σ EM

Both the cell signal EEM

reconstructs the energy deposited by electrons and photons correctly but does not include any corrections
for the loss of signal for hadrons due to the non-compensating character of the ATLAS calorimeters.

cell and σ EM

Topo-clusters are formed by a growing-volume algorithm starting from a calorimeter cell with a highly
signiﬁcant seed signal. The seeding, growth, and boundary features of topo-clusters are in this algorithm
controlled by the three respective parameters {S , N, P}, which deﬁne signal thresholds in terms of σ EM
and thus apply selections based on ς EM

Useful conﬁgurations employ a S > N ≥ P rule, as reﬂected in the default conﬁguration for ATLAS
indicated above. The default values are derived from optimisations of the response and the relative energy
resolution for charged pions in test-beam experiments using ATLAS calorimeter prototypes [43].

3.1.1 Collecting cells into topo-clusters

Topo-cluster formation is a sequence of seed and collect steps, which are repeated until all topologically
connected cells passing the criteria given in Eqs. (3) and (4) and their direct neighbours satisfying the
condition in Eq. (5) are found. The algorithm starts by selecting all cells with signal signiﬁcances ς EM
cell
passing the threshold deﬁned by S in Eq. (3) from calorimeter regions which are allowed to seed clusters.3
These seed cells are then ordered in decreasing ς EM
cell .

3 Calorimeter cells marked as having read-out or general signal extraction problems in the actual run conditions are not con-

sidered as seeds.

end-cap calorimeter (EMEC), (c) the ﬁrst sampling of the hadronic LAr end-cap calorimeter (HEC), and (d) the ﬁrst
module of the LAr forward calorimeter (FCAL). The spectra are extracted from 2012 zero-bias data at √s = 8 TeV
with an average number of pile-up interactions (cid:104)µ(cid:105) = 28. The dashed lines indicate S = ±4, N = ±2, and P = 0.

Each seed cell forms a proto-cluster. The cells neighbouring a seed and satisfying Eq. (4) or Eq. (5) are
collected into the corresponding proto-cluster. Here neighbouring is generally deﬁned as two calorimeter
cells being directly adjacent in a given sampling layer, or, if not in the same layer, which have at least
partial overlap in the (η, φ) plane. This means that the cell collection for topo-clusters can span modules
within the same calorimeter as well as calorimeter sub-detector transition regions. Should a neigbouring
cell have a signal signiﬁcance passing the threshold deﬁned by the parameter N in Eq. (4), its neighbours
are collected into the proto-cluster as well. If a particular neighbour is a seed cell passing the threshold
S deﬁned in Eq. (3), the two proto-clusters are merged. If a neighbouring cell is attached to two diﬀerent
proto-clusters and its signal signiﬁcance is above the threshold deﬁned by N, the two proto-clusters are
merged. This procedure is iteratively applied to further neighbours until the last set of neighbouring cells
with signiﬁcances passing the threshold deﬁned by P in Eq. (5), but not the one in Eq. (4), is collected.
At this point the formation stops.

The resulting proto-cluster is characterised by a core of cells with highly signiﬁcant signals. This core is
surrounded by an envelope of cells with less signiﬁcant signals. The conﬁguration optimised for ATLAS

(3) to (5). This
particular conﬁguration with P = 0 means that any cell neighbouring a cell with signal signiﬁcance
passing the threshold given by N in Eq. (4) is collected into a proto-cluster, independent of its signal.
Using the correlations between energies in adjacent cells in this way allows the retention of cells with
signals that are close to the noise levels while preserving the noise suppression feature of the clustering
algorithm.

The implicit noise suppression implemented by the topo-cluster algorithm discussed above leads to sig-
niﬁcant improvements in various aspects of the calorimeter performance, such as the energy and spatial
resolutions in the presence of pile-up. Contributions from large negative and positive signal ﬂuctuations
introduced by pile-up can survive in a given event, though, and thus contribute to the sensitivity to pile-up
observed in e.g. the jet response [42], in addition to the cell-level eﬀects mentioned in Sect. 2.2.1. Ex-
amples of the eﬀect of this noise suppression on the cells contributing to zero-bias events recorded with
ATLAS in 2012 are shown in the cell signal-signiﬁcance spectra in Figs. 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), and 5(d) for four
diﬀerent LAr calorimeters in ATLAS.

3.1.2 Treatment of negative cell signals

Negative cell signals in the ATLAS calorimeters are the result of ﬂuctuations introduced predominantly by
pile-up and, to a lesser extend, by electronic noise, as discussed in Sects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. The thresholds
in Eqs. (3) to (5) are applied in terms of the absolute value of ς EM
cell . This means that not only large
positive cell signals can seed a cluster, but also those with large negative signals. In addition, cells with
negative signals can also contribute to the cluster growth control and are added to the envelope around
the topo-cluster core.
The use of cells with EEM
cell < 0 as topo-cluster seeds provides a diagnostic tool for the amount of noise
in the overall calorimeter signal for a given event. At the ﬁxed noise value given in Eq. (1) and used
in Eq. (3), the luminosity-dependent actual noise in the event is reﬂected in the number of topo-clusters
reconstructed with negative seeds. This number serves as an estimator mainly for out-of-time pile-up.
Topo-clusters with negative seeds often have a total energy EEM
cell | (cid:29) P.
This is due to the dominance of the negative seed and the correlation between this seed signal and signals
in the neighbouring cells, which likely also have EEM
cell < 0. If a negative seed signal is generated by
out-of-time pile-up, it is induced by a particle injected into the calorimeter more than 100 ns before the
event. Its residual signal trace is scaled by the negative undershoot of the shaping function shown in
Fig. 3. This particle also injected signiﬁcant energy in the neighbouring cells at the same time, due to
its electromagnetic or hadronic shower, which leads to EEM
cell < 0 in these cells at the time of the event.
For the same reasons, topo-clusters from out-of-time pile-up seeded by EEM
clus > 0,
because they are typically generated by particles injected in past bunch crossings closer in time (within
100 ns). The topo-clusters with EEM
clus < 0 can be used to provide an average global cancellation of
contributions of clusters seeded by positive ﬂuctuations in out-of-time pile-up in full event observables
including Emiss
Clustering cells with EEM
cell < 0 in any topo-cluster, including those containing and seeded by large posit-
ive signals, improves noise suppression due to the local cancellation of random positive (upward) noise
ﬂuctuations by negative (downward) ﬂuctuations within this cluster. Allowing only positive signals to
contribute introduces a bias in the cluster signal, while the random cancellation partially suppresses this
bias.

clus < 0 as well, especially when |ς EM

cell > 0 often yield EEM

[44].

T

16

To reconstruct physics objects such as jets from topo-clusters, only those clusters with a net energy EEM
clus >
0 are considered. The expectation is that clusters with net negative energy have no contribution to the
signal of the reconstructed object, as there is no correlation of the corresponding downward ﬂuctuation
with the ﬁnal state that is triggered and reconstructed.

3.1.3 Cluster splitting

The proto-clusters built as described in Sect. 3.1.1 can be too large to provide a good measurement of
the energy ﬂow from the particles generated in the recorded event. This is true because spatial signal
structures inside those clusters are not explicitly taken into account in the formation. In particular, local
signal maxima indicate the presence of two or more particles injecting energy into the calorimeter in close
proximity.

To avoid biases in jet-ﬁnding and to support detailed jet substructure analysis as well as a high-quality
Emiss
reconstruction, proto-clusters with two or more local maxima are split between the corresponding
T
signal peaks. A local signal maximum is deﬁned by EEM
cell > 500 MeV, in addition to the topological
requirements for this cell to have at least four neighbours and that none of the neighbours has a larger
signal. Also, the location of cells providing local maxima is restricted to cells in the EM sampling layers
EMB2, EMB3, EME2 and EME3, and to FCAL0. This means that for a proto-cluster located completely inside
the electromagnetic calorimeters, or extending from the electromagnetic to the hadronic calorimeters,
splitting is guided by the spatial cell signal distributions in the highly granular electromagnetic calorime-
ters. The cluster splitting is reﬁned in an additional step, where signal maxima can be provided by cells
from the thin EM sampling layers EMB1 and EME1 with a highly granular η-strip read-out geometry, all
sampling layers in the hadronic calorimeters (HEC0 to HEC3, Tile0 to Tile2), and the hadronic forward
calorimeter modules FCAL1 and FCAL2.4 The use of EMB1 and EME1 in the topo-cluster splitting improves
the photon separation in π0 → γγ.
The cluster splitting algorithm can ﬁnd cells which are neighbours to two or more signal maxima. In this
case, the cell is assigned to the two highest-energy clusters after splitting of the original topo-cluster it is
associated with. This means that each cell is only shared once at most, and, even then, is never shared
between more than two clusters.
The sharing of its signal between the two clusters with respective energies EEM
clus,2 is expressed
in terms of two geometrical weights wgeo
cell,2. These weights are calculated from the distances of
the cell to the centre of gravity of the two clusters (d1, d2), measured in units of a typical electromagnetic
shower size scale in the ATLAS calorimeters,5 and the cluster energies,

are displayed in Fig. 6(b). The cells from this module included in any topo-cluster are shown in Fig. 6(c).
This display shows the eﬀectiveness of cluster splitting in tracing signal structures. Comparing Figs. 6(a)
and 6(c) clearly shows the survival of cells with |ς EM
cell | < 2 in the vicinity of more signiﬁcant signals, even
if those are not in the same module (or sampling layer).

3.1.4 Cluster multiplicities in electromagnetic and hadronic showers

One of the original motivations behind any cell clustering is to reconstruct single-particle showers with the
highest possible precision in terms of energy and shape. The immediate expectation is that the clustering
algorithm should be very eﬃcient in reconstructing one cluster for each particle entering the calorimeter.
While this view is appropriate for dense and highly compact electromagnetic showers with relatively small
shower-to-shower ﬂuctuations in their longitudinal (along the direction of ﬂight of the incoming particle)
and lateral (perpendicular to the direction of ﬂight) extensions, hadronic showers are subject to much
larger intrinsic ﬂuctuations leading to large shower-to-shower variations in their shapes and compactness.
Hadrons generated in inelastic interactions in the course of the hadronic shower can even travel signiﬁcant
distances and generate sub-showers outside the direct neighbourhood of the calorimeter cell containing
the initial hadronic interaction. This means that topo-clusters can contain only a fraction of the hadronic
shower.

tromagnetic showers (π0) and hadronic showers (π−) in the central (barrel) calorimeter region are shown
in Fig. 7(a). The dependence of the average Nclus on the pseudorapidity η is displayed in Fig. 7(b).
Neutral pions with Eπ0 = 100 GeV injected into the detector at a ﬁxed direction often generate only one
topo-cluster from largely overlapping electromagnetic showers, as the angular distance between the two
photons from π0→ γγ is small. This is demonstrated by the Nclus distribution for topo-clusters generated
by π0 at |η| = 0.3 in ATLAS in Fig. 7(a) peaking at Nclus = 1, with a probability only slightly larger
than the one for Nclus = 2. In the latter case the two topo-clusters from the π0 are generated by (1)
resolving the two photon-induced showers, (2) a possible residual imperfect signal collection and proto-
cluster splitting in the topo-cluster algorithm, or by (3) accidental inclusion of additional topo-cluster(s)
generated by electronic noise. While the particular reason for the second cluster depends on eﬀects
introduced by local features including the calorimeter read-out granularity and cell noise levels at a given
direction η, hypothesis (1) is found to be least likely as it is observed that the energy sharing between
the two topo-clusters is typically very asymmetric. The leading topo-cluster generated by π0 at 100 GeV
contains very close to 100 % of the total energy in this calorimeter region, indicating that the second and
any further topo-clusters arise from hypotheses (2) and (3).

Figure 7(b) shows the average Nclus as a function of the generated particle direction η = ηgen. Especially
around transition regions at |η| ≈ 1.4 (central to end-cap calorimeters) and |η| ≈ 3.2 (end-cap to forward
calorimeters), which both have reduced calorimetric coverage, Nclus can signiﬁcantly increase due to
reduction or loss of the core signal of the showers.
The number of clusters generated by π− with E = 100 GeV injected at η = 0.3 peaks at Nclus = 3 and has a
more signiﬁcant tail to higher multiplicities, as shown in Fig. 7(a). This is expected for hadronic showers,
where the distance between two inelastic interactions with signiﬁcant energy release is of the order of the
nuclear interaction length λnucl, typically O(10 cm). This can lead to several well-separated topo-clusters.
For example, at 100 GeV incident energy the leading topo-cluster generated by π− contains on average
85 GeV, while the next-to-leading topo-cluster contains about 10 GeV on average. The remaining energy
is distributed among one or more low-energy topo-clusters.

The wider hadronic shower spread introduces a higher sensitivity of Nclus to the calorimeter read-out
granularities and transition regions, as can be seen in Fig. 7(b). The transition regions at |η| ≈ 0.8–1.0,
|η| ≈ 1.4 and |η| ≈ 3.2 aﬀect the topo-cluster formation more than in the case of electromagnetic showers,
not only in terms of the peak Nclus but also in terms of the range in η. In particular the region around
|η| ≈ 0.8–1.0 has a larger eﬀect on Nclus for hadrons than for electromagnetic interacting particles, as
this is the transition from the central to the extended Tile calorimeter introducing reduced calorimetric
coverage for hadrons. The central electromagnetic calorimeter provides hermetic coverage here, without
any eﬀect on Nclus. The sharp drop of Nclus for π− at |η| = 2.5 corresponds to the reduction in calorimeter
cell granularity by a factor of approximately four.

3.2 Cluster kinematics

The cluster kinematics are the result of the recombination of cell energies and directions. The presence
of cells with EEM

cell < 0 requires a special recombination scheme to avoid directional biases.

20

The cluster directions are calculated as signal-weighted barycentres (ηclus, φclus). Using EEM
cell < 0 in this
scheme leads to distortion of these directions, even projecting them into the wrong hemispheres. Ignor-
ing the contribution of cells with negative signals, on the other hand, biases the cluster directions with
contributions from upward noise ﬂuctuations. To avoid both eﬀects, the cluster directions are calculated
with absolute signal weights |EEM

Here Ncell is the number of cells in the cluster, and wgeo

cluster splitting, as given in Eqs. (6) to (8) in Sect. 3.1.3. The direction of each cell is given by (ηcell, φcell),
calculated from its location with respect to the centre of ATLAS at (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0) in the detector
reference frame. The cluster directions are therefore reconstructed with respect to this nominal detector
centre.

with terms involving θclus, the polar angle calculated from ηclus, and φclus.
The massless pseudo-particle interpretation is appropriate as there is no physically meaningful cluster
mass without a speciﬁc and valid particle hypothesis for the origin of the signal. Such a hypothesis seems
to be impossible to obtain from the calorimeter signals alone, especially for hadrons or hadronically
decaying particles, where particle identiﬁcation often requires a measurement of the charge. A topo-
cluster mass could in principle be reconstructed from the cell signals and their spatial distribution, but this
observable is dominated by lateral shower spreading, which does not represent a physically meaningful
mass. It is also highly aﬀected by the settings for the noise thresholds, which control the lateral and
longitudinal spread of the cluster in a given pile-up environment (see Sect. 3.1.1).

In addition, hadronic showers tend to be split more often into two or more topo-clusters, as discussed in
Sect. 3.1.4 for single particles. Also, it is very likely in the proton–proton collision environment at the
LHC that a given topo-cluster contains signals from several particles, especially when located inside a jet,
as a mix of electromagnetic and hadronic showers or shower fragments. These issues make a physical
particle hypothesis very unlikely, and any cluster mass measurement would be very hard to interpret or
validate in relation to a “real” particle.

Figure 8: Schematic view of geometrical moments for topo-clusters.

4 Topo-cluster moments

The shape of a topo-cluster and its internal signal distribution contain valuable information for signal char-
acterisation with respect to its origin, and therefore cluster-based calibrations. The list of reconstructed
observables (“cluster moments”) is long. In this section the focus is on moments used to evaluate the sig-
nal quality in data, to determine the cluster location and size, and to calibrate each cluster. The geometry
relevant to some of the moments is depicted in Fig. 8. Moments which are useful for purely technical
reasons, such as those related to the information about the true energy deposited in the calorimeter in MC
simulations, are not discussed in this paper.

Most moments are deﬁned at a given order n for a given calorimeter cell variable υcell as

All moments use the EM scale signals, and do not depend on any reﬁned calibration. The moment calcu-
lation is restricted to in-time signals, therefore only cells with EEM

is given by Enorm,

Even though higher-order moments can be reconstructed, only centroids (n = 1) and spreads (n = 2) are
used.

4.1 Geometrical moments

Each topo-cluster with at least three cells with EEM
cell > 0 has a full set of geometrical moments. Simple
directional moments (barycentres) and locations (centres of gravity) are available for all clusters. Not
all geometrical moments can be evaluated in a meaningful way for all topo-clusters, mostly due to lack
of relevant information in clusters with few cells. In this case, a default value speciﬁc to each of these
moments is provided.

The location of a topo-cluster is deﬁned by its centre of gravity (cid:126)c in three-dimensional space, as shown
in Fig. 8. This centre is calculated from the ﬁrst moments of the three Cartesian coordinates specifying
the calorimeter cell centres, following the deﬁnition given in Eq. (12). These locations are provided in
the nominal detector frame of reference deﬁned by the interaction point (IP) being located at (x = 0, y =
0, z = 0).

In addition to the absolute location measured by the centre of gravity, the distance λclus of the centre
of gravity from the calorimeter front face, determined along the shower axis (see below and Fig. 8), is
calculated for each topo-cluster.

4.1.2 Directions

The direction of a topo-cluster is given by (ηclus, φclus), reconstructed as given in Eqs. (9) and (10). In
addition, the ﬁrst- and second-order directional moments using ηcell and φcell are calculated using Eq. (12)
with n = 1 and n = 2, respectively. The reference for these directions is the IP discussed above.

The shower axis is a measure of the direction of ﬂight of the incoming particle. It is deﬁned by a principal
value analysis of the energy-weighted spatial correlations between cells with EEM
cell > 0 with respect to the
cluster centre in Cartesian coordinates,

The Cuv ﬁll a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix C = [Cuv]. The eigenvector of C closest to the direction (cid:126)c from the
IP to the centre of gravity of the topo-cluster is taken to be the shower axis (cid:126)s. If the angular distance ∆α
between (cid:126)c and (cid:126)s is ∆α > 20◦, (cid:126)c is used as the shower axis. Figure 8 depicts the geometry of the two axis
deﬁnitions for topo-clusters.

4.1.3 Extensions and sizes

The size of the topo-cluster is calculated with respect to the shower axis (cid:126)s and the centre of gravity (cid:126)c. For
this, cells are ﬁrst located with reference to (cid:126)s and (cid:126)c. The distances of a cell at (cid:126)xi to the shower axis and
the centre of gravity are then given by

ri = |((cid:126)xi − (cid:126)c ) × (cid:126)s|
λi = ((cid:126)xi − (cid:126)c ) · (cid:126)s

(radial distance to shower axis);

(longitudinal distance from shower centre of gravity).

The ﬁrst moment (cid:104)λ(cid:105) calculated according to Eq. (12) with υcell,i = λi and n = 1 is (cid:104)λ(cid:105) = 0 by deﬁnition.
The same equation is used for the ﬁrst moment (cid:104)r(cid:105) of ri (υcell,i = ri, n = 1). The longitudinal and lateral

23

extensions of a topo-cluster can then respectively be measured in terms of the second moments (cid:104)λ2
i (cid:105) and
(cid:104)r2
i (cid:105), again using Eq. (12), but with n = 2. Specifying cluster dimensions in this fashion describes a
spheroid with two semi-axes of respective lengths

As calorimeter technologies and granularities change as function of η in ATLAS, measures representing
the lateral and longitudinal extension of topo-clusters in a more universal and normalised fashion are
constructed. These measures are deﬁned in terms of second moments with value ranges from 0 to 1,

The (cid:104)r2(cid:105)out term is calculated using Eq. (12) with n = 2 and υcell,i = ri, but with ri = 0 for the two most
energetic cells in the cluster. The term (cid:104)r2(cid:105)core is calculated with the same equation, but now with a ﬁxed
ri = rcore for the two most energetic cells, and ri = 0 for the rest. The calculation of the corresponding
terms (cid:104)λ2(cid:105)out and (cid:104)λ2(cid:105)core for m2
long follows the same respective rules, now with υcell,i = λi in Eq. (12) and
λcore for the most energetic cells in (cid:104)λ2(cid:105)core.6
The normalised moments m2

mensions, rather they measure the energy dispersion in the cells belonging to the topo-cluster along the
two principal cluster axes. Characteristic values are m2

getic cells distributed in close proximity along the longitudinal (lateral) cluster extension, and m2

(m2

ues of m2
long (m2
lat) therefore mean short (narrow) topo-clusters, while larger values are indicative of long
(wide) clusters.

The fact that this approximation holds for both the cluster size in η (ση) and φ (σφ) is due to the particular
granularity of the ATLAS calorimeters.

4.2 Signal moments

Topo-cluster moments related to the distribution of the cell signals inside the cluster are useful in determ-
ining the density and compactness of the underlying shower, the signiﬁcance of the cluster signal itself,
and the quality of the cluster reconstruction. These moments thus not only provide an important input
to the calibrations and corrections discussed in Sect. 5, but also support data quality driven selections in

6 The constant parameters λcore and rcore are introduced to ensure a ﬁnite contribution of the highest-energy cells to m2
long and
m2
lat, respectively, as those can be very close to the principal shower axes. The speciﬁc choices λcore = 10 cm and rcore = 4 cm
are motivated by the typical length of electromagnetic showers and the typical lateral cell size in the ATLAS electromagnetic
calorimeters.
7 The ση and σφ in this equation represent the energy-weighted root mean square (RMS) of the respective cell directions ηcell
and φcell. Correspondingly, the full cluster width estimates are closer to 2.35ση and 2.35σφ.

the reconstruction of physics objects. Additional topo-cluster signal quality moments related to instant-
aneous, short term, and long term detector defects introducing signal eﬃciency losses are available but
very technical in nature, and very speciﬁc to the ATLAS calorimeters. Their discussion is outside of the
scope of this paper.

4.2.1 Signal signiﬁcance

The signiﬁcance of the topo-cluster signal is an important measure of the relevance of a given cluster
contribution to the reconstruction of physics objects. Similar to the cell signal signiﬁcance ς EM
cell given in
Eq. (2) in Sect. 3.1, it is measured with respect to the total noise σ EM
noise,clus in the topo-cluster. With the
assumption that the cells in the cluster have incoherent noise, σ EM

noise,clus is deﬁned as

In addition to ς EM
cell of the cell with the highest signiﬁcant signal (the original cluster seed) is available
to further evaluated the topo-cluster. A highly signiﬁcant seed is a strong indication of an important cluster
signal, even if ς EM

clus may be reduced by inclusion of a larger number of less signiﬁcant cell signals.

4.2.2 Signal density

The signal density of the topo-cluster is indicative of the nature of the underlying particle shower. It can
be evaluated in two diﬀerent approaches. First, EEM
clus can be divided by the volume the cluster occupies
in the calorimeter. This volume is the sum of volumes of all cells contributing to the cluster. The signal
density reconstructed this way is subject to considerable instabilities introduced by signal ﬂuctuations
from noise, as large volume cells can be added with a very small signal due to those ﬂuctuations.

The default for topo-cluster calibration is the second and more stable estimate of the topo-cluster signal
density measured by the cell-energy-weighted ﬁrst moment ρclus = (cid:104)ρcell(cid:105) of the signal densities ρcell,i =
EEM
cell,i/Vcell,i of cells i = 1 . . . Ncell forming the cluster. Here Vcell,i is the volume of cell i. The ρclus
variable is calculated using Eq. (12) with υcell,i = ρcell,i and n = 1.
It is much less sensitive to the
accidental inclusion of large volume cells with small signals into the cluster, and is used in the context of
topo-cluster calibration. The corresponding second moment is calculated using Eq. (12) with n = 2. It
indicates the spread of cell energy densities in the topo-cluster, thus its compactness.

25

4.2.3 Signal timing

The topo-cluster signal timing is a sensitive estimator of its signal quality.
It is particularly aﬀected
by large signal remnants from previous bunch crossings contributing to the cluster, or even exclusively
forming it, and can thus be employed as a tag for topo-clusters indicating pile-up activity.
The reconstructed signal EEM
cell in all calorimeter cells in ATLAS is derived from the reconstruction of
the peak amplitude of the time-sampled analogue signal from the calorimeter shaping ampliﬁers. In the
course of this reconstruction the signal peaking time tcell with respect to the 40 MHz LHC bunch crossing
clock is determined as well. The timing tclus of a topo-cluster is then calculated from tcell,i of the clustered
cells i = 1, . . . Ncell according to

4.2.4 Signal composition

The signal shape inside a topo-cluster is measured in terms of energy sharing between the calorimeters
contributing cells to the cluster, and other variables measuring the cell signal sharing. The energy sharing
between the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters is expressed in terms of the signal ratio femc, and
can be used as one of the characteristic observables indicating an underlying electromagnetic shower. The
signal fraction fmax carried by the most energetic cell in the cluster is a measure of its compactness. The
signal fraction fcore of the summed signals from the highest energetic cell in each longitudinal calorimeter
sampling layer contributing to the topo-cluster can be considered as a measure of its core signal strength.
It is sensitive not only to the shower nature but also to speciﬁc features of individual hadronic showers.
These fractions are calculated for each topo-cluster as follows (EMC denotes the electromagnetic calori-
meters8 in ATLAS),

All these moments have a value range of [0, 1].

One of the variables that can be considered for further evaluation of the relevance of the cluster signal
in the presence of pile-up is the energy EEM
cell > 0 only. In particular

the ratio of EEM
clus is sensitive to the negative energy content of a given topo-cluster which
is largely injected by out-of-time pile-up dominated by the negative tail of the bipolar signal shaping
function discussed in Sect. 3.1.2.

4.2.5 Topological isolation

The implicit noise suppression in the topological clustering algorithms leads to signal losses aﬀecting the
calorimeter response to particles, as further discussed in Sect. 5.4. As these signal losses appear at the
boundary of the topo-cluster, corresponding corrections need to be sensitive to whether the lost signals
may be included in another close-by cluster or if they are lost for good. This is particularly important for
jets, where the topo-cluster density can be very high.
The degree of isolation is measured by the isolation moment fiso, with 0 ≤ fiso ≤ 1. A topo-cluster
with fiso = 1 is completely isolated, while a cluster with fiso = 0 is completely surrounded by others.
The isolation measures the sampling layer energy-weighted (EEM
-weighted) fraction of non-clustered
neighbour cells on the outer perimeter of the topo-cluster. It is reconstructed by ﬁrst counting the number
of calorimeter cells Nnoclus
in a sampling layer s neighbouring a topo-cluster but not collected into one

themselves. Second, the ratio Nnoclus

5 Local hadronic calibration and signal corrections

The motivation for the calibration scheme described in this section arises from the intention to provide
a calorimeter signal for physics object reconstruction in ATLAS which is calibrated outside any partic-
ular assumption about the kind of object. This is of particular importance for ﬁnal-state objects with a
signiﬁcant hadronic signal content, such as jets and, to a lesser degree, τ-leptons. In addition to these
discrete objects, the precise reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum requires well-calibrated
hadronic signals even outside hard ﬁnal-state objects, to e.g. avoid deterioration of the Emiss
resolution
due to highly ﬂuctuating (fake) pT-imbalances introduced by the non-linear hadronic response on the EM
scale.

T

The topo-cluster moments provide information sensitive to the nature of the shower generating the cluster
signal. This information can be explored to apply moment-dependent calibrations cluster-by-cluster, and
thus correct for the eﬀects of the non-compensating calorimeter response to hadrons, accidental signal
losses due to the clustering strategy, and energy lost in inactive material in the vicinity of the topo-cluster.
The calibration strategy discussed in some detail in the following is local because it attempts to calibrate
highly localised and relatively small (in transverse momentum ﬂow space) topo-clusters.9 As the local

9 As cells and clusters are localised in the calorimeters, the preferred variables for this space are the azimuth φ and the pseu-
dorapidity η, rather than the rapidity y. As topo-clusters are reconstructed as massless pseudo-particles (see Sect. 3.2), y = ηclus
for the complete object.

27

hadronic calibration includes cell signal weighting, the calibration based on topo-clusters is referred to as
“local hadronic cell weighting” (LCW) calibration.

All calibrations and corrections are derived using MC simulations of single pions (charged and neutral) at
various energies in all ATLAS calorimeter regions. This fully simulation-based approach requires good
agreement between data and these MC simulations for the topo-cluster signals and moments used for
any of the applied corrections in terms of distribution shapes and averages. Reconstructed observables
which are not well-modelled by simulation are not considered. The data/MC comparisons for most used
observables are shown in the context of the discussion of the methods using them.

5.1 General topo-cluster calibration strategy

The LCW calibration aims at the cluster-by-cluster reconstruction of the calorimeter signal on the ap-
propriate (electromagnetic or hadronic) energy scale. In this, the cluster energy resolution is expected to
improve by using other information in addition to the cluster signal in the calibration. The basic calori-
meter signal ineﬃciencies that this calibration must address are given below.
Non-compensating calorimeter response: All calorimeters employed in ATLAS are non-compensating,
meaning their signal for hadrons is smaller than the one for electrons and photons depositing the
same energy (e/π > 1). Applying corrections to the signal locally so that e/π approaches unity on
average improves the linearity of the response as well as the resolution for jets built from a mix of
electromagnetic and hadronic signals. It also improves the reconstruction of full event observables
such as Emiss
, which combines signals from the whole calorimeter system and requires balanced
electromagnetic and hadronic responses in and outside signals from (hard) particles and jets.

T

Signal losses due to clustering: The topo-cluster formation applies an intrinsic noise suppression, as
discussed in detail in Sect. 3.1. Depending on the pile-up conditions and the corresponding noise
thresholds, a signiﬁcant amount of true signal can be lost this way, in particular at the margins of the
topo-cluster. This requires corrections to allow for a more uniform and linear calorimeter response.
Signal losses due to energy lost in inactive material: This correction is needed to address the limita-
tions in the signal acceptance in active calorimeter regions due to energy losses in nearby inactive
material in front, between, and inside the calorimeter modules.

The corrections collected in the LCW calibration address these three main sources of signal ineﬃciency.
The speciﬁcs of the calibrations and corrections applied to correct for these signal ineﬃciencies depend on
the nature of the energy deposit – hadronic (HAD) or electromagnetic (EM). Therefore, the ﬁrst step of the
topo-cluster calibration procedure is to determine the probability 0 ≤ P EM
clus ≤ 1 that a given topo-cluster is
generated by an electromagnetic shower. This approach provides straightforward dynamic scales (cluster-
by-cluster) for the application of speciﬁc electromagnetic (P EM
clus) calibrations and
corrections. For topo-clusters with P EM

exclusive categorisation based on the probability distributions described in Sect. 5.2 can lead to incon-
sistent calibrations especially for low-energy or small (few cells only) clusters, as misclassiﬁcation for

The weights wem-cal
represent the factors applied by the EM or HAD calibration to the cell
signal. The eﬀective representation of all calibration steps in terms of these cell-level signal weights
implements a consistent approach independent of the nature of the actual correction applied at any given
step. As detailed in Sects. 5.3 to 5.5, the weights can depend on the cell signal itself, thus yielding a
diﬀerent weight for each cell. They can also represent cluster-level corrections generating the same weight
for all cells, or a subset of cells, of the topo-cluster. This cell weighting scheme therefore provides not
only the corrected overall cluster energy after each calibration step by weighted cell signal re-summation,
but also the corresponding (possibly modiﬁed) cluster barycentre. Thus the cumulative eﬀect on the topo-
cluster energy and direction can be validated after each step. The steps of the general LCW calibration
are schematically summarised in Fig. 9, and the individual steps are described in more detail below.

The EM calibrations and corrections and their respective parameters are determined with single-particle
MC simulations of neutral pions for a large set of energies distributed uniformly in terms of log(E)
between 200 MeV and 2 TeV, at various directions η. The same energy and η phase space is used for
the corresponding simulations of charged pions to determine the HAD calibrations and corrections. The
signals in these simulations are reconstructed with thresholds corresponding to the nominal σ EM
noise for a
given run period, which reﬂects the pile-up conditions according to Eq. (1) in Sect. 2.2.2. Only electronic
noise is added into the signal formation in the MC simulation, so that the derived calibrations and cor-
rections eﬀectively correct for signal losses introduced by the clustering itself. In particular, additional
signal from pile-up and modiﬁcations of the true signal by out-of-time pile-up are not considered, as these
are expected to cancel on average.

in the text, in a selected bin of the cluster energy EEM
clus and the cluster direction ηclus. The red line indicates the
boundary of the P EM
clus > 50 % selection, below which the topo-cluster is classiﬁed as mostly electromagnetic (“EM-
like”) and above which it is classiﬁed as mostly hadronic (“HAD-like”). The small EM-like area at the edge of the
HAD-like region stems from neutral pions showering late. These areas are typical in regions of the detector where
the second layer of the EM calorimeter is thinner and substantial parts of the shower are deposited in its last layer.
The larger volume of the cells in this last layer leads to the reduced energy density while the position at the back of
the EM calorimeter means a larger λclus.

5.2 Cluster classiﬁcation

As discussed in Sect. 4, most topo-clusters provide geometrical and signal moments sensitive to the nature
of the shower producing the cluster signal. In particular, electromagnetic showers with their compact
shower development, early starting point and relatively small intrinsic ﬂuctuations can generate cluster
characteristics very diﬀerent from those generated by hadronic showers. The latter are in general sub-
jected to larger shower-by-shower ﬂuctuations in their development and can be located deeper into the
calorimeter. In addition, the hadronic showers show larger variations of their starting point in the calori-
meter. A classiﬁcation of each topo-cluster according to its likely origin determines the most appropriate
mix of EM and HAD calibration and correction functions to be applied.

The depth λclus of the topo-cluster (Sect. 4.1.1) and its average cell signal density ρclus (Sect. 4.2.2), both
determined in bins of the cluster energy EEM
clus and the cluster direction ηclus, are found to be most eﬃcient
in classifying the topo-clusters. Using the MC simulations of single charged and neutral pions entering
the calorimeters at various pseudorapidities and at various momenta, the probability for a cluster to be
of electromagnetic origin (P EM
clus) is then determined by measuring the eﬃciency for detecting an EM-like
cluster in bins of four topo-cluster observables,

interacting particles of diﬀerent incident energies.

clus ≈ 2 GeV. This energy
range is dominated by topo-clusters from low-energy hadrons, in addition to clusters from less-energetic
hadronic shower fragments created by the splitting algorithm described in Sect. 3.1.3. For EEM
clus > 2 GeV
the average λclus is increasingly dominated by higher-energy clusters produced by splitting and located in
the electromagnetic calorimeter, thus pulling it to lower values. The rise of (cid:104)λclus(cid:105) for topo-clusters with
EEM
clus (cid:38) 10 GeV reﬂects increasing contributions from energetic hadrons with dense showers generating
high-energy clusters deeper in the hadronic calorimeter. The good agreement between data and MC
simulations for both classes of topo-clusters supports the use of λclus for the cluster classiﬁcation derived
from MC simulations for data [38].

clus shown in Fig. 11(d) shows a similar shape up to EEM

5.3 Hadronic calibration

The hadronic calibration for topo-clusters attempts to correct for non-compensating calorimeter response,
meaning to establish an average e/π = 1 for the cluster signal. The calibration reference is the locally
deposited energy in the cells of a given topo-cluster, which is deﬁned as the sum of all energies released
by various shower processes in these cells. In each of the cells, the signal EEM
cell from this deposited energy
Edep
cell is reconstructed on the electromagnetic energy scale. This yields cell signal weights deﬁned as

wcell =

Edep

(21)

In the case of electromagnetic signals, wcell = wem-cal
≡ 1 by construction of the electromagnetic scale.
In hadronic showers, Edep

the signal, including nuclear binding energies and escaping energy carried by neutrinos. In this case,

Figure 12 shows the ρcell distributions in topo-clusters clustered into jets with the anti-kt algorithm with
a distance parameter R = 0.6, in several diﬀerent regions of the electromagnetic calorimeters in ATLAS
(deﬁned by S calo), for 2010 data and MC simulations. Similar distributions for cells inside the same jets
but located in hadronic calorimeter regions are displayed in Fig. 13. Good agreement between data and
MC simulations is observed in the hadronic sampling layers over the whole ρcell spectrum. Discrepancies
between data and MC simulations mostly in the high-end tails of the ρcell distributions in the electromag-
netic sampling layers indicate slightly more compact showers in the simulation. Overall, the quality of
the modelling of the cell signal densities is suﬃcient for topo-cluster calibration purposes. Both ﬁgures
are taken from Ref. [38].

5.4 Correction for out-of-cluster signal losses

In the process of applying the noise suppression described in Sect. 3.1, cells with small true deposited
energy generated by EM or HAD showers may not be collected into a topo-cluster, either due to lack of
signiﬁcance of their small signal, or due to the absence of a neighbouring cell with a signiﬁcant signal.
The energy losses introduced by this eﬀect are estimated using single-particle MC simulations. A corres-
ponding out-of-cluster correction is determined and applied to nearby topo-clusters. The cells with true
energy not included into clusters are referred to as lost cells.

The challenge in determining this correction is the assignment of the energy deposited in a lost cell to a
certain cluster. As discussed in Sect. 3.1.3 and seen in Fig. 7, hadronic showers in particular can generate
more than one topo-cluster. An algorithm deﬁning an out-of-cluster neighbourhood to search for the lost
cells has been developed for this assignment. This is depicted schematically in Fig. 14. The actual size of
the neighbourhood for a given topo-cluster is determined by the maximum angular distance between the

10 This is because the electromagnetic energy scale reconstructs a signal larger than expected for the deposited energy in case of

pure ionisation, due to the lack of showering.

While the determination of the out-of-cluster correction depends on this assignment algorithm, the applic-
ation of the correction is context dependent. A topo-cluster in a jet is likely to have directly neighbouring
clusters which can capture its out-of-cluster signal loss. It is therefore expected that topo-clusters in jets
need less out-of-cluster corrections than isolated topo-clusters away from other clusters. The degree of
isolation is measured by the isolation moment fiso introduced in Sect. 4.2.5. The out-of-cluster correc-

Figure 15 shows fiso for topo-clusters classiﬁed as either electromagnetic or hadronic in jets reconstructed

observed, both for the details of the respective fiso in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b) and the average as a function
of EEM
clus dependence of fiso is very similar for both kinds of topo-clust-
ers. The peak structure in the fiso distributions shown in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b) is indicative of topo-clusters
which have a large fraction of their energy in one sampling layer in the (regular) ATLAS calorimeter read-
out segmentation with at least 16 cells around the perimeter of clustered cells in a sampling layer. The
isolation of this layer then dominates the overall fiso, as given by Eq. (17) in Sect. 4.2.5.

5.5 Dead material corrections

Particles traversing the inactive (dead) material in front of or between calorimeter modules can deposit
energy in it, thus reducing the measurable energy. This energy loss is addressed on average by the dead
material correction. It is derived with single-particle MC simulations, where the deposited energy in the
dead material outside of the active calorimeter can be calculated. This material is divided into virtual
cells with a pointing geometry in (η, φ). These cells are similar to the ATLAS calorimeter cells, but
typically larger in size. Depending on the particle’s direction of ﬂight, eight distinct regions are mapped
out, as summarised in Table 2. The energy deposited in the dead material cells is determined for charged
and neutral pions at various energies and directions, and almost everywhere correlated with measurable

This weighted energy loss is collected as a function of observables of the associated topo-cluster given
in Table 2. Lost energy deposited in front of the calorimeter is compensated for by applying a correction
proportional to the pre-sampler signals in topo-clusters which contain these signals. In the forward region
the signal in the ﬁrst module FCAL0 of the FCAL is used for this purpose.

energy losses in topo-clusters that are located in the direct neighbourhood of inactive material categorised
as region 8 and that have no other dead material correction applied.

Like the out-of-cluster correction, the dead material correction is a cluster-based correction. It is ex-
pressed in terms of a weight wdm
clus, which is determined from the various correction functions or lookup
tables. The corresponding cell signal weight is the same for all cells of the given cluster (wdm
clus).
This correction therefore does not aﬀect the topo-cluster barycentre or centre of gravity.

5.6 Fully calibrated cluster kinematics

The reconstructed and fully calibrated topo-cluster energy ELCW
clus depends on the EM likelihood of the
cluster, as discussed in Sect. 5.2, and is characterised by ELCW
clus. The cluster direction changes due
to the calibration, because it is calculated from energy-weighted cell directions using Eqs. (9) and (10)
with wgeo
The eﬀective cell calibration weight wcal
applied yields the cluster energy Ecal

All input parameter values used in the LCW calibration are derived from dedicated single-particle MC
simulations. The validity of this calibration is conﬁrmed with data, where the cumulative eﬀect of the
hadronic calibration and the out-of-cluster and dead material corrections on the signal of topo-clusters
found in jets is analysed and compared to corresponding MC simulations. Figure 17 summarises the
quality of the LCW calibration for these clusters, both as a function of the basic cluster signal EEM
clus and
the cluster direction ηclus [38]. Data are compared to MC simulations after the application of the hadronic
cell weights (Ecal

These double-ratios are shown in Fig. 17 as well, and indicate generally good agreement between data

various calibration steps indicate the cumulative eﬀects of transition regions between calorimeters in
ATLAS, due to not only technology changes but also to changes in the read-out granularity. Especially

transition between the central and the end-cap calorimeters at |η| ≈ 1.45, (2) the transition between end-
cap and forward calorimeters at |η| ≈ 3.2, and (3) the upper limit of the ATLAS calorimeter acceptance at

6 Performance of the topo-cluster reconstruction algorithm

The reconstruction performance of the topological cell clustering algorithm in ATLAS can be evaluated
in the context of reconstructed physics objects such as jets or (isolated) single particles. In addition,
features of the topo-cluster signal outside these physics objects can be studied with exclusive samples
of low-multiplicity ﬁnal states without jets. These are preferably selected by muons as those leave only
small signals in the calorimeter, nearly independent of their pT (W → (cid:96)ν or Z → µµ without jets). The
topo-clusters not used in reconstructing hard physics objects reﬂect the calorimeter sensitivity to small
and dispersed energy ﬂows generated by the proton–proton collisions in the LHC, including pile-up. The
level of agreement between data and MC simulations is used in all cases as a metric for the reconstruction
performance.

6.1 Single-particle response

The calorimeter response to single isolated charged hadrons with well-measured momentum in the ID
was determined using proton–proton collision data at √s = 900 GeV in 2009 [45]. The single-hadron
response at higher centre-of-mass energies was determined in 2010 at √s = 7 TeV and in 2012 at √s = 8

TeV. Due to the relatively low luminosities in the 2009 and 2010 run periods, pile-up contributions are
insigniﬁcant in the corresponding data. These measurements provide important validations of the topo-
cluster algorithm and the calorimeter acceptance in general.

The principal observable is the energy-to-momentum ratio E/p. The calorimeter energy E is reconstruc-
ted using the topo-clusters located around the direction of the track of the incoming charged particle with
momentum p, including the ones with EEM
clus < 0. The eﬀect of the axial magnetic ﬁeld is taken into
account by extrapolating the reconstructed tracks into the calorimeter. The energy E is then calculated
by summing the EM-scale energies from all sampling layers s of topo-clusters which have a barycentre
(ηs, φs) within ∆R = 0.2 of the track direction extrapolated to each s, as described in more detail in
Ref. [45]. The sampling layer energies are summed irrespective of their sign, i.e. E < 0 is possible.

The results of the measurement of E/p are shown in Figs. 18(a) and 18(b) for reconstructed isolated tracks
in proton–proton collisions at √s = 900 GeV. The distributions reﬂect the acceptance of the calorimeter
for charged particles in the given momentum ranges. Entries for E/p < 0 indicate that the incoming
track is matched with a topo-cluster generated by signiﬁcant electronic noise. The number of tracks with
no matching calorimeter signal (E = 0 ⇒ E/p = 0) is indicative of none or only a small fraction of the
particle energy reaching the calorimeter, and the signal generated by this energy fraction is not suﬃciently
signiﬁcant to survive the implicit noise suppression in the topo-cluster formation described in Sect. 3.1.
The likelihood PE=0(ddm) to ﬁnd E = 0 for a charged particle passing through inactive material of various
thicknesses ddm, measured in terms of the nuclear interaction length λnucl, is shown in Fig. 19(a) for
isolated tracks within |η| < 1.0 in proton–proton collisions at √s = 900 GeV. The various values of ddm
are extracted from the detector description in the MC simulation using the direction |η| of the incoming
tracks. The data and MC simulations agree well, indicating an appropriate description of the actual
detector geometry in the MC simulation. The likelihood to have no matching signal in the calorimeter
shows the expected increase with increasing inactive material.
The dependence of PE=0 on the track momentum is shown in Fig. 19(b) for isolated tracks with |η| < 0.6.
Good agreement between data and MC simulations is observed, which together with the results displayed

(FTFP_BERT). The results for 2012 data from a dedicated sample with insigniﬁcant pile-up (µ ≈ 0) are

charged mesons and baryons, are available in Ref. [45].

6.2 Eﬀect of pile-up on topo-cluster observables

The topo-cluster reconstruction performance is aﬀected by in-time and out-of-time pile-up. While in-time
pile-up is expected to usually increase the number of topo-clusters with increasing number of reconstruc-
ted vertices (NPV), the out-of-time pile-up leads to cluster signal and shape modiﬁcations introduced by
the calorimeter signal shaping functions described in Sect. 2.2.1.

The high density of very signiﬁcant cell signals generated inside jets in the calorimeter increases the like-
lihood of low-energy pile-up signals to survive in the topo-cluster formation, according to the formation
rules given in Sect. 3.1. Cell signals generated by the energy ﬂow of relatively isolated particles entering
the calorimeter outside jets or (stochastic) jet-like ﬂow structures11 often have less signiﬁcant neighbour-
ing cells and thus contribute less often to topo-clusters. Consequently, the acceptance of the calorimeter
for these particles, many of which are produced by pile-up, is lower than for particles in or around a jet.

In this section the modelling of the pile-up eﬀects on the kinematics and moments used for the LCW
calibration is compared to data for topo-clusters formed inside and outside jets for the conditions during
2012 running. The eﬀect of pile-up on jets reconstructed from topo-clusters is discussed in Sect. 6.3,
together with the stability of topo-cluster-based observables associated with the jet and its composition.

6.2.1 Event selection

The data used for the evaluation of the pile-up eﬀects on topo-cluster kinematics and moments are collec-
ted from Z → µµ events recorded in 2012. As indicated in Sect. 2.1, the corresponding sample is deﬁned
by a muon-based trigger. The additional event selection, applied to both data and the corresponding MC
simulations, requires two muons with pT > 25 GeV within |η| < 2.4 and an invariant mass mµµ of the
muon pair of 80 GeV < mµµ < 100 GeV for the inclusive sample. For the analysis of an exclusive sample
with softer hadronic recoil against the Z boson transverse momentum (pZ
T), events with at least one jet
reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm and a distance parameter R = 0.4 and pT > 20 GeV are removed.
This sample is characterised by a ﬁnal state dominated by in-time pile-up signal contributions, with only
a small number of topo-clusters associated with the hadronic recoil.

Another exclusive sample for the analysis of topo-cluster features in jets is selected by requiring at least
one anti-kt jet with pT > 20 GeV in the event. Like in the selection applied to collect the exclusive sample
without jets, all jets are fully calibrated and corrected, including a correction for pile-up (see Sect. 2.4).
All inclusive and exclusive samples are thus characterised by their stability against pile-up.

6.2.2 Modelling of topo-cluster kinematics in events with pile-up

Detailed data/MC comparisons of topo-cluster kinematics yield signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the meas-
ured and the modelled spectra. The transverse momentum spectra of topo-clusters reconstructed on the
EM scale (pEM
T,clus) for the ﬁnal state of an inclusive Z→ µµ sample, are shown in Fig. 21(a) for the central,

disagreement are an imperfect detector simulation or the modelling of the underlying physics processes
in the MC generator.
Using the data overlay method described in Sect. 2.3.3 improves the data/MC comparison of the pEM
T,clus
spectra signiﬁcantly, especially in the low-pT regime, where pile-up is expected to have a large eﬀect.
This improvement can be seen in Figs. 21(d), 21(e), and 21(f) for the respective ηclus ranges.

6.2.3 Transverse momentum ﬂow in the presence of pile-up

The transverse momentum ﬂow in the Z → µµ sample without jets with pT > 20 GeV is reconstruc-
ted using the exclusive selection deﬁned in Sect. 6.2.1. Topo-clusters are selected by pEM
T,clus > pT,min,
where pT,min ∈ {0, 100 MeV, 250 MeV, 500 MeV, 1 GeV, 2 GeV}. The ﬂow is measured by the average
total transverse momentum (cid:104)ΣpEM
T,clus(cid:105), carried by all or selected topo-clusters in any given direction

The pile-up dependence of the average transverse momentum ﬂow in various detector regions, as ex-
pressed by (cid:104)ΣpEM
T,clus(cid:105)(µ), is shown in Fig. 23. MC simulations predict the ﬂow in the more central detector
regions well, even for the more pile-up-sensitive topo-cluster selection ΣpEM
T,clus > 0 in Figs. 23(a) and
23(b). Larger deviations are observed in Figs. 23(d) and 23(e) for these two regions for topo-clusters
selected with pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV. In the forward region, MC simulations predict higher pT-ﬂow for both
topo-cluster selections, as can be seen in Figs. 23(c) and 23(f). The slope of the (cid:104)ΣpEM
T,clus(cid:105)(µ) dependence
in this region is very similar for data and MC simulations.

The observations in Figs. 21 to 23 indicate that in the case of the fully simulated pile-up the simulation of
the topo-cluster response to the underlying transverse energy ﬂow outside jets suﬀers from MC simulation

6.2.4 Topo-cluster multiplicity in the presence of pile-up

The calorimeter signal occupancy in the exclusive Z→ µµ sample is determined using selected topo-clust-
ers with pEM
T,clus > pT,min and the pT,min values used in Sect. 6.2.3. The relevant observable is the cluster
number density, which is given by the number of topo-clusters per unit η (∂Nclus/∂η). Figure 24 shows
the average (cid:104)∂Nclus/∂η(cid:105)(ηclus) for these topo-cluster selections, for data and MC simulations with fully
simulated pile-up. The shape observed especially for the less restrictive selections with pT,min ≤ 500 MeV
in Figs. 24(a) to 24(d), reﬂects the variations of the calorimeter segmentation and the eﬀect of sub-
detector transition regions on the topo-cluster formation across the full ATLAS acceptance |ηclus| < 4.9.
Generally, MC simulations describe the pT-ﬂow better than the number of clusters. This is expected as the
description of the summed pT-ﬂow is constrained with more weight in the numerical ﬁts for the ATLAS
tunes than the particle number density.

The topo-cluster number density changes rapidly at |ηclus| = 2.5. This is a consequence of the reduction
of the calorimeter cell granularity by about a factor of four in terms of pseudorapidity and azimuth (∆η ×
∆φ), which reduces the number of potential topo-cluster seeds. The granularity change also introduces
more signal overlap between individual particles in any given cell and thus less spatial resolution for the
reconstruction of the corresponding energy ﬂow due to this merging of particle signals. In addition, the
larger cells increase the noise thresholds, as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), which changes the calorimeter
sensitivity. This change of sensitivity can be evaluated by comparing (cid:104)ΣpEM
T,clus(cid:105) with the corresponding

pT-ﬂow expressed by (cid:104)ΣpEM
T,cell(cid:105)(ηcell) is unbiased with respect to noise suppression as none is applied.
Consequently, it is subject to larger ﬂuctuations. Figure 25 shows this measurement for a 2012 MB
data sample with pile-up close to the nominal µ = 30 used for the noise thresholds (see Sect. 2.2.2). It
indicates signal losses due to clustering up to about 50 % for 2.5 < |η| < 4.5, and some signal increase due
to suppression of cells with E < 0, in particular in the end-cap region 1.5 < |η| < 2.5. All topo-clusters
and calorimeter cell signals are accepted for this study.

The geometry eﬀect yields the steep drop in topo-cluster number density at this boundary. Raising the
transverse momentum threshold for accepted topo-clusters increasingly mitigates the geometrical and
noise eﬀects on the cluster number density. The data/MC comparison shows larger deﬁciencies for more

inclusive topo-cluster selections, which capture more signals from pile-up.
It improves as the pT,min
threshold increases, when the selections are dominated by clusters that are generated by harder emissions
than those due to pile-up.

The dependence of the average topo-cluster number on the pile-up activity, here expressed in terms of
µ, is shown for topo-clusters with pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV in Fig. 26. Deﬁciencies of the MC
simulations when compared to data are most noticeable at higher pile-up (larger µ), in particular for the
pEM
T,clus > 0 selection, which is more sensitive to pile-up. It is observed that MC simulations generate
more topo-clusters per pile-up interaction than data in the central and end-cap calorimeter region. This
observation is inverted in the forward calorimeter region, as can be seen in Fig. 26(c).

T,clus > 0 and pEM

These qualitative diﬀerences can arise from the modelling of soft physics, which is tuned with reconstruc-
ted charged tracks in the detector region |η| < 2.5 but is not experimentally constrained in the forward
region. In addition, imperfections in the description of the inactive material in front of the calorimeter
in the detector simulation can change the acceptance for low-energy particles signiﬁcantly in diﬀerent
ways in the various η-regions. Also, mismodelling in the simulation of the (mostly hadronic) lateral and
longitudinal shower spreads in the calorimeters, as e.g. documented in Refs. [48, 49], can lead to diﬀer-
ent topo-cluster splitting behaviour in the diﬀerent calorimeter regions. In particular the increased signal
overlap between particles in the forward region is suspected to introduce a higher sensitivity of the cluster
splitting to the detector simulation.
As can be seen in Figs. 26(d) to 26(f), counting only topo-clusters with pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV introduces
a more similar slope in the cluster number density as a function of µ. The qualitative behaviour of
(cid:104)∂Nclus/∂η(cid:105)(ηclus) in the various detector regions is diﬀerent than for the more inclusive topo-cluster se-
lection, with MC simulation predicting slightly fewer clusters in the central and end-cap regions shown
in Figs. 26(d) and 26(e). In the forward region, data shows overall fewer clusters than MC simulation, as
can be seen in Fig. 26(f), but a very similar number of additional clusters per additional proton–proton
interaction.

6.2.5 Modelling of the topo-cluster depth location in the presence of pile-up

Pile-up is expected to aﬀect cluster moments as well as the overall cluster kinematics. Its diﬀuse en-
ergy emission can not only produce additional topo-clusters, but also change the centre of gravity, the
barycentre, and other cluster shapes. In some cases, pile-up can actually increase the cluster splitting, as
additional local signal maxima can be inserted into a topo-cluster by pile-up. In addition, the increased
cell noise can produce additional signal minima in groups of previously connected cells in the topo-clust-
er. This last eﬀect can be more important for topo-clusters in jets and is discussed in Sect. 6.3. The
topo-cluster depth location λclus discussed here serves as an example for the quality of modelling cluster
moments in the presence of pile-up. Other moments are investigated in the context of jets.
The modelling of λclus in the calorimeter is compared to data in Fig. 27 for the inclusive Z → µµ sample
in the same bins of ηclus used for the study of pT,clus in Fig. 21. The fully simulated events with pile-up
from the minimum-bias simulations show signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the data, while the MC simulations
overlaid with pile-up from data show good agreement with respect to all features of these distributions.

Figure 27: The distribution of the topo-cluster depth location, measured in terms of log10(λclus/λ0), for clusters in

MC simulations including fully simulated pile-up for all topo-clusters within (a) |ηclus| < 0.2, (b) 2.0 < |ηclus| < 2.2,
and (c) 3.8 < |ηclus| < 4.0. The corresponding distributions for MC simulations with pile-up overlaid are depicted
in (d), (e), and (f). The ratios of the distributions for data and MC simulations are shown below the respective
distributions. The shaded bands indicate the statistical uncertainties for MC simulations.

The complex structure of the distributions reﬂects the longitudinal calorimeter segmentation in the various
regions deﬁned by ηclus. For example, the forward direction 3.8 < |ηclus| < 4.0 is covered by the FCAL,
which has three coarse and deep longitudinal segments (approximately 2.5/3.5/3.5 λnucl). This structure
generates topo-clusters preferably in the depth centre of each module, as can be seen in Figs. 27(c) and
27(f). These distributions are dominated by low-energy clusters associated with pile-up interactions such
that the improvement seen by using data overlay is expected.

Similarly to the studies of the kinematic and ﬂow properties of topo-clusters discussed in Sects. 6.2.2 and
6.2.3, more exclusive topo-cluster selections are also investigated. Figure 28 shows data/MC comparisons
of the λclus distributions for clusters within |ηclus| < 0.2 for pEM
T,clus > pT,min with pT,min ∈ {1, 2, 5} GeV,
for MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up and for MC simulations with pile-up from data overlaid.
The MC simulation with overlaid pile-up agrees better with data than the one with fully simulated pile-up,

6.3 Topo-clusters in jets

Jets are important in many analyses at the LHC. Therefore, the performance of the simulation of their
constituents is important, in particular for analyses employing jet substructure techniques or relying on
the jet mass.
In order to study the topo-cluster features in jets and the jet topo-cluster composition,
exclusive jet samples are extracted from data and MC simulation using the Z → µµ and jet selection
described in Sect. 6.2.1. As the jets are globally corrected for pile-up [16], they form a stable kinematic
reference for the evaluation of pile-up eﬀects on the topo-clusters used to reconstruct them. Jets include
only topo-clusters with E > 0, as required by the kinematic recombination.

6.3.1 Jet energy scale and topo-cluster-based response in pile-up

As mentioned above, the fully calibrated four-momentum Pjet of jets reconstructed from topo-clusters is
corrected for pile-up eﬀects. Therefore, the corresponding transverse momentum pT,jet provides a stable
signal for event selections and the kinematics of the true particle ﬂow. The basic jet four-momentum is

the stability of the corrected jet pT scale, Fig. 29(b) indicates the diﬀerent sensitivities of the uncorrected
response to pile-up in the various detector regions. The diﬀerent shapes seen in this ﬁgure are mostly
related to the calorimeter granularity and the speciﬁc shaping functions in the diﬀerent LAr calorimeters.
While the general expectation that every pile-up interaction adds energy to the jet is indicated in the rise
of p LCW
with increasing µ, the dependence of this ratio on µ is less pronounced for jets with
3.5 < |ηjet| < 4.5 in the FCAL calorimeter. This observation is related to the much coarser calorimeter

6.3.2 Topo-cluster multiplicity in jets

Figure 30 shows the distributions of the number of topo-clusters (Njet
clus) in central, end-cap and forward
jets. Distributions are shown using fully simulated pile-up and using data overlay. The discrepancies
between MC simulations and data, while slightly reduced in the simulations employing the pile-up over-
laid from data, generally persist.
The data/MC comparisons of the cluster multiplicity distributions counting only topo-clusters with pEM
T,clus >
1 GeV for the same Z → µµ data and MC simulations are shown in Fig. 31. This comparison is signi-
ﬁcantly improved with respect to Fig. 30, indicating that the number of low-energy topo-clusters in jets
is poorly simulated. The comparison of data to MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up and with

pile-up overlaid from data for the more inclusive cluster multiplicities in Fig. 30 indicates that pile-up is
likely not the main source for the deﬁciencies in the MC simulation, as the comparison does not improve
signiﬁcantly when pile-up is taken from the data. This observation, together with the insensitivity of the
data/MC comparison of the multiplicity of harder topo-clusters to the choice of pile-up modelling in MC
simulations shown in Fig. 31, suggests that the deﬁciencies in the simulation of the low-energy topo-clust-
er multiplicity arise from imperfections in the detector model, response or tuning of the parton shower
and other sources of soft emissions, including multiple parton interactions in the underlying event, rather
than from the modelling of pile-up or electronic noise. Further investigations concerning the distribution
of the topo-cluster location in jets conﬁrm this interpretation and are presented in Sect. 6.3.3.

to merging and suppression of pile-up signals. Figure 32(a) also conﬁrmed are the already mentioned

clus(cid:105) and (cid:104)Ncore

clus with only considering topo-clusters with pEM

shows no observable dependency on pile-up.
Calculating Njet
T,clus > 2 GeV yields the result
for the pile-up dependence of (cid:104)Njet
clus (cid:105) displayed in Fig. 32(c) and Fig. 32(d), respectively.
While both (cid:104)Njet
clus (cid:105) are nearly independent of µ in the central detector region, they show more
complex dependencies on the pile-up activity in the end-cap region. The loss of hard topo-clusters in
both the overall jet and in its core with increasing µ reﬂects additional cluster splitting induced by the
diﬀuse energy ﬂow from pile-up in the end-cap calorimeters. The observations in both the central and the
end-cap regions are well described by MC simulations.

clus(cid:105) and (cid:104)Ncore

A good quality of the MC predictions is also achieved when comparing the number of hard topo-clusters
above the pEM
T,clus threshold in forward jets. This number shows only a small increase with increasing µ,
as shown in Fig. 32(c). This is due to the fact that the cluster splitting behaviour does not change with
increasing pile-up in the coarse granularity of the FCAL. In this module, the residual signal contribution
from pile-up shifts a small number of additional clusters above the 2 GeV threshold, yielding an increase
of about 10 % for both (cid:104)Njet
clus(cid:105) and (cid:104)Ncore
clus(cid:105)(µ) with
and without the pEM
T,clus > 2 GeV selection shows that the cut occasionally removes a topo-cluster from
a forward jet such that (cid:104)Njet
clus(cid:105) is reduced by not more than 15 % for any given µ. The selection aﬀects
(cid:104)Ncore
clus (cid:105)(µ) in a diﬀerent way. While (cid:104)Ncore
clus (cid:105)(µ) ≈ const without the cut, the average number of topo-clust-
ers in the jet core passing the pEM
T,clus selection is smaller by approximately 15 % in the region of lower
pile-up activity, where (cid:104)Njet
clus(cid:105)(µ < 10) ≈ (cid:104)Ncore
clus (cid:105)(µ < 10) both with and without the selection. It is only
about 5 % smaller for higher pile-up, where (cid:104)Njet
clus (cid:105)(µ > 30) independent of the cut, as
can be seen by comparing Figs. 32(b) with 32(d) for forward jets.

T,jet

The distribution of the depth location of all topo-clusters inside anti-kt jets reconstructed with R = 0.4
and with 30 GeV < p LCW+JES
< 40 GeV in Z → µµ events in 2012 data and MC simulations is shown
in Fig. 33. Like for the depth distribution of topo-clusters in the inclusive Z → µµ sample presented in
Fig. 27, the MC simulations with overlaid pile-up data show better agreement with data than the ones
with fully simulated pile-up. The diﬀerences in the jet context are signiﬁcantly smaller than observed for
the inclusive selection.
Applying a pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV cut to the topo-clusters in the jets results in the depth distributions shown in
Fig. 34. This selection also shows better data/MC agreement for the sample with fully simulated pile-up,
an indicator consistent with the better simulation of harder signals observed in e.g. Fig. 28. A noticeable
diﬀerence from the depth distributions obtained from the inclusive sample in Fig. 28(a) is that for topo-
clusters in jets the data/MC agreement in the case of the fully simulated pile-up is already better for the
pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV selection, as can be seen in Fig. 34(a). In addition, comparing Figs. 33 and 34 shows that
the pEM
T,clus > 1 GeV selection predominantly removes topo-clusters at small depth λclus, as the distributions
are depopulated more for smaller values of λclus than for larger ones. This means that mostly topo-clusters
generated by soft particles with little penetration depth into the calorimeters, including those consistent
with pile-up, are removed. The data/MC comparisons are thus less sensitive to pile-up modelling issues,
and therefore show better agreement.

6.3.4 Calibration and signal features of the leading topo-cluster

The leading topo-cluster in a jet is deﬁned as the one with the highest pEM
T,clus. Its moments and its signal
contribution to the jet provide a good reference for the dependence of important topo-cluster calibration
inputs on pile-up. The leading cluster is found in the anti-kt jets reconstructed with R = 0.4 and with
30 GeV < p LCW+JES
< 40 GeV in the 2012 Z → µµ sample in data and MC simulations with full pile-up
simulation.

T,jet

The distributions of the topo-cluster moments relevant to the LCW calibration for the leading cluster in
the jet are shown in Figs. 35(a) to 35(f). The distribution of the overall LCW calibration weight described
in Sect. 5.6 is shown in Figs. 35(g) to 35(i).

The distribution of the depth location of the leading topo-cluster, already discussed for all and selected
topo-clusters in the inclusive Z→ µµ sample in Sect. 6.2.5 and the Z→ µµ sample with jets in Sect. 6.3.3,
is shown in Figs. 35(a), 35(b), and 35(c) for the central, end-cap, and the forward detector region, respect-
ively. As expected from the previous observations, MC simulations agree reasonably well with data. It
is also observed that the leading cluster in the central and end-cap detector regions is most often located

either in the electromagnetic or in the hadronic calorimeters, and rarely between the modules. In the
forward region, the hardest cluster is most often located in the ﬁrst FCAL module.

The signal density ρclus of topo-clusters is deﬁned in Sect. 4.2.2. Figures 35(d) to 35(f) show the ρclus
distributions for the leading topo-cluster in the jet. The complex structures of the signal density distribu-
tions are well modelled. Their shape in the central and end-cap regions is driven by the jet fragmentation.
Jets with a leading photon, or two nearby photons from a neutral pion decay, can produce the lead-
ing topo-cluster with a high signal density, reﬂecting the single or the two largely overlapping compact
electromagnetic shower(s) reconstructed in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeters. Jets with
a leading hadron that reaches the detector typically produce less dense topo-cluster signals in the cor-
responding hadronic shower. For these jets an additional geometric eﬀect is introduced, as the leading
topo-cluster is more likely located in the hadronic calorimeters in ATLAS.12 The typically larger cell
sizes in these detectors introduce lower density signals even for compact showers.

12 In the case of a leading (stable) hadron in the jet, the leading topo-cluster may still arise from a photon, as the selection of
this cluster is performed on the EM scale. This introduces a bias due to e/π > 1, which is nevertheless well modelled in MC
simulations, according to Fig. 35.

The forward detector region has a coarser longitudinal segmentation, with the ﬁrst module FCAL0 closest
to the collision vertex being about 30 X0 and 2.5 λnucl deep [50]. Consequently, most leading topo-clusters
in jets going in this direction are located in FCAL0, as can be seen in the λclus distribution in Fig. 35(c).

The ρclus distribution in Fig. 35(f) therefore does not show the features seen in Figs. 35(d) and 35(e),
because the calorimeter read-out granularity changes smoothly within this module. The hard transitions
between calorimeter modules with very diﬀerent granularity aﬀecting the ρclus distributions in the central
and end-cap regions are absent.

The overall eﬀect of the LCW calibration described in Sect. 5 on the signal scale of the leading topo-
cluster can be measured by the ratio of the basic EM scale signal EEM
clus to the fully calibrated cluster
signal ELCW
clus . The distribution of this ratio is shown for the three detector regions in Figs. 35(g) to 35(i).
The distributions in these ﬁgures are inclusive with respect to the topo-cluster classiﬁcation described in
Sect. 5.2. The shapes observed in the central and end-cap detector regions reﬂect this classiﬁcation of
the leading topo-cluster. The rightmost peak is mostly produced by topo-cluster that are generated by
electromagnetic showers and often classiﬁed as such. In this case the calibration corrections consist of
relatively small out-of-cluster and dead material corrections only, as outlined in Sect. 5. As a consequence,
EEM
clus/ELCW
is closer to unity. Topo-clusters classiﬁed as hadronic receive much larger corrections, and
clus
are more likely to populate the lower side of the EEM
The EEM
clus distribution in the forward detector region shown in Fig. 35(i) does not display these
shapes. This is due to a lack of classiﬁcation power in the coarse geometry of the FCAL. Here most
topo-clusters are classiﬁed as hadronic and receive relatively large corrections. The populated ranges
of EEM
in Figs. 35(g) and 35(h) indicate that the magnitude of the total correction scaling the
basic cluster signal EEM
reaches considerably higher values in
the central region than in the end-cap detector regions. This reﬂects the fact that the incoming particle
energies are higher at larger |η| for a given range in jet pT. Therefore, the calorimeter response to hadrons
relative to the response to electrons and photons (e/π) rises with increasing |η|, and reduces the amount
of correction needed. This should also be observed for the comparison of the end-cap with the forward
region displayed in Fig. 35(i), yet in the FCAL the out-of-cluster and dead material corrections are larger
than the hadronic calibration addressing e/π > 1 and thus dominate the overall LCW calibration.

This means that flead is expected to satisfy 0 < flead < 1. Figure 36 shows the distribution of flead in the
three detector regions. The flead distributions in the central (Fig. 36(a)) and end-cap regions (Fig. 36(b))

flead in the forward detector region shown in Fig. 36(c) displays a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent shape introduced
by the relatively low topo-cluster multiplicity in jets in this region, as shown in Figs. 30(c) and 30(f).

6.3.5 Pile-up dependence of leading topo-cluster signal features

clus/ELCW
The pile-up dependence of the average leading cluster signal fraction (cid:104) flead(cid:105), the average (cid:104)EEM
clus (cid:105)
ratio, and the average depth location of the leading topo-cluster are displayed in Fig. 37. The pile-up
activity is measured in terms of µ for this evaluation. A small linear drop of (cid:104) flead(cid:105)(µ) is observed for
increasing µ in all three detector regions in Fig. 37(a). This signal loss of the leading topo-cluster can
arise from two eﬀects. First, the increase of the out-of-time pile-up contributions due to the rising µ
reduces the signal due to the bipolar signal shaping function employed in the ATLAS LAr calorimeters
(see discussion in Sect. 2.2.1). Second, the increasing in-time pile-up contributions at higher µ and the
increased noise introduced by more out-of-time pile-up leads to additional splitting in the topo-cluster
formation, which can take signal away from the leading cluster in the jets.

13 The particular choice of normalisation in the deﬁnition of flead in Eq. (31) means that even for jets with only one topo-cluster

f mop
lead is expected to be smaller than unity.

Figure 37(b) shows that the overall LCW calibration applied to the leading topo-cluster, measured by
the average ratio (cid:104)EEM
clus (cid:105), in the end-cap and forward detector regions is stable against increasing
pile-up activity. A slight drop can be observed with increasing µ in the central detector region, which
indicates changes in the topo-cluster properties relevant to the LCW calibration introduced by increasing
pile-up. One possible reason for that may be eﬀects on the topo-cluster splitting in this region, as pile-
up can induce spatial energy distributions leading to modiﬁcations in the splitting even for hard signal
clusters.14 The depth location λclus, which enters the LCW calibration in the classiﬁcation step discussed
in Sect. 5.2, is found to be rather stable against pile-up, as shown in Fig. 37(c). The pile-up dependence
of the leading topo-cluster features discussed here are found to be well modelled in MC simulations with

6.3.6 Leading topo-cluster geometry and shapes

The spatial extensions of the leading topo-cluster in a jet are calculated as described in Sect. 4.1. The
distributions of the normalised lateral energy dispersion m2
lat given in Eq. (13) and the normalised lon-
gitudinal energy dispersion m2
long given in Eq. (14) are shown in Fig. 38 for the leading topo-cluster in
jets reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with R = 0.4 and 30 GeV < p LCW+JES
< 40 GeV, in Z → µµ
events in 2012 data and MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up. The lateral extensions represented
by m2
lat are reasonably well modelled in all three detector regions, with some residual discrepancies in
particular in the low-value tails and upper edges of the spectra in the end-cap and forward regions. The
longitudinal extensions measured by m2
long are modelled well in the central and forward detector regions,
but their modelling shows some deﬁciencies in the end-cap region.

The distribution of the leading topo-cluster length measure
(cid:104)λ2(cid:105)
detector regions is shown in Figs. 39(a) to 39(c). The MC simulations reproduce the shape of the
distributions from data well in the central and forward regions, with some deﬁciencies observed in the
end-cap region. The shapes in the central and end-cap region are due to leading topo-clusters contained in
the electromagnetic calorimeters populating the left peak of the distribution (short clusters) and leading
topo-clusters in the hadronic calorimeters populating the right peak with longer clusters. The shape of
the length distribution in the forward region shown in Fig. 39(c) is characterised by a sharp drop on the
(cid:112)
right of the spectrum, which corresponds to the half-depth of cells (225 mm) in the FCAL modules. This
(cid:112)
shows that in this detector region the leading topo-cluster rarely extends into all three FCAL modules, as
(cid:104)λ2(cid:105) > 225 mm. The leading cluster is more likely to share its
indicated by only few topo-clusters with
(cid:104)λ2(cid:105) ≈ 225 mm indicating a near equal
energy between the ﬁrst two modules FCAL0 and FCAL1, with
share and

(cid:112)
(cid:104)λ2(cid:105) < 225 mm indicating that most of the cluster energy is in FCAL0.

(cid:112)

14 In particular, pile-up can introduce an additional signal maximum at the boundary of a relatively dense leading topo-cluster,

which can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on e.g. ρclus and other cluster properties pertinent to the LCW calibration.

The size Rlead
ηφ of the leading topo-cluster in (η, φ) space is calculated from the respective cluster width
estimates ση(φ) given in Eq. (15). Its distributions in various calorimeter regions are shown in Fig. 40. The
Rlead
ηφ distribution in the central region in Fig. 40(a) is consistent with topo-clusters in a calorimeter with a
ﬁne and regular read-out granularity. The double-peak structure in the end-cap region in Fig. 40(b) shows
contributions from leading topo-clusters extending beyond |η| = |ηjet| = 2.5, where the cell granularity
drops sharply by about a factor of four. This generates the right peak in the distribution.15 The Rlead
ηφ distri-
bution in the forward detector region displayed in Fig. 40(c) is consistent with a non-pointing calorimeter
read-out segmentation with smooth transitions in the granularity from about ∆η × ∆φ ≈ 0.15 × 0.15 at
|η| = 3.5 to ∆η × ∆φ ≈ 0.3 × 0.3 for |η| = 4.5.

6.3.7 Pile-up dependence of leading topo-cluster geometry and shapes

The dependence of the geometry and shape of the leading topo-cluster in a jet on the pile-up activity
measured by µ is shown in Fig. 41. No signiﬁcant dependence is observed for the average longitudinal
extension of this cluster shown in Fig. 41(a), the average size of this cluster in (η, φ) space in Fig. 41(b),
and its average lateral energy dispersion, deﬁned in Eq. (13) and displayed in Fig. 41(c).

The data/MC comparison of the average pile-up dependences shows generally acceptable agreement, but
also suggests some residual deﬁciencies likely related to the simulation of the longitudinal and lateral
(hadronic) shower shapes. Corresponding observations are reported in Refs. [48,49,51,52] in the context
of detailed comparisons of ATLAS test-beam data with simulations.

15 The location of this peak is consistent with the change of the cell size in sampling layers EME1 and EME2 of the electromagnetic

end-cap calorimeter at |η| = 2.5, see Table 1.

7 Conclusion

Topological cell signal clusters (topo-clusters) provide a well-understood and calibrated signal deﬁnition
for hadronic ﬁnal-state reconstruction in the ATLAS calorimeters. The principal algorithm generating
these topo-clusters includes a noise-suppression scheme based on signal-signiﬁcance patterns which is
similar to applications in previous experiments. The innovative approach developed for the ATLAS ca-
lorimeters not only employs a highly reﬁned implementation of this algorithm in a high-energy, high-
luminosity hadron collider environment characterised by signiﬁcant collision backgrounds introduced
by pile-up, but also uses the topo-clusters as a signal base for a local hadronic calibration (LCW) in a
non-compensating calorimeter.

Both the topo-cluster formation and the LCW calibration have been validated in collisions without pile-
up recorded in 2010, and in the more active pile-up environments observed in 2011 and 2012 operations.
The residual eﬀects of pile-up on cluster kinematics and observables in data are well controlled in that
they can be reproduced with suﬃcient precision in MC simulations for topo-clusters either inside or
outside jets. The largest observed data–MC diﬀerences mainly arise from imperfect modelling of the soft
collision physics aﬀecting pile-up. Overlaying pile-up from data on generated hard-scatter interactions
in MC simulations yields signiﬁcantly better agreement for most kinematic variables and topo-cluster
moments.

From the LHC Run 1 experience, topo-clusters are now established as a well-performing signal base for
jet and transverse missing momentum (Emiss
) reconstruction in ATLAS. They provide noise suppression
important for a high-quality calorimeter signal, and in this reduce the amount of data needed to represent
the ﬁnal state in the detector. Their spatial resolution allows not only detailed analysis of the energy ﬂow
in the proton–proton collision events as needed for Emiss
reconstruction but also analysis of more localised
energy-ﬂow structures inside jets. This is done routinely in boosted-object reconstruction techniques
applied in jet substructure analysis, with recent examples from ATLAS discussed in Refs. [53–56].
