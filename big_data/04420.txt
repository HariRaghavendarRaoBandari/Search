ABSTRACT
We establish the connection between the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and the dwarf
galaxy candidates discovered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) by building a dynam-
ical model of the MC satellite populations, based on an extensive suite of tailor-made
numerical simulations. Our model takes into account the response of the Galaxy to
the MCs infall, the dynamical friction experienced by the MCs and the disruption of
the MC satellites by their hosts. The simulation suite samples over the uncertainties
in the MC’s proper motions, the masses of the MW and the Clouds themselves and
allows for ﬂexibility in the intrinsic volume density distribution of the MC satellites.
As a result, we can accurately reproduce the DES satellites’ observed positions and
kinematics. Assuming that Milky Way (MW) dwarfs follow the distribution of sub-
haloes in ΛCDM, we further demonstrate that, of 14 observed satellites, the MW halo
contributes fewer than 4 (8) of these with 68% (95%) conﬁdence and that 7 (12) DES
dwarfs have probabilities greater than 0.7 (0.5) of belonging to the LMC. Marginal-
ising over the entire suite, we constrain the total number of the Magellanic satellites
at ∼ 70, the mass of the LMC around 1011M(cid:12) and show that the Clouds have likely
endured only one Galactic pericentric passage so far. Finally, we give predictions for
the line-of-sight velocities and the proper motions of the satellites discovered in the
vicinity of the LMC.

1 INTRODUCTION

Before clues to the nature of the Dark Matter (DM) and the
details of the power spectrum of density ﬂuctuations in the
early Universe were uncovered, it had already been shown
that the small “seed” objects must have collapsed ﬁrst (Pee-
bles 1965) to later spawn the assembly of the larger ones.
From the bottom up, gravity fabricates objects that ap-
pear self-similar across a large range of mass scales (Press &
Schechter 1974) - this is a common feature of an entire class
of structure formation scenarios in an expanding Universe.
For the Cold Dark Matter model in particular, the mass
function of bound DM condensations is demonstrated to ex-
tend as far down as the numerical resolution allows; however,
the levels of sub-structure within sub-structure - so called
sub-sub-haloes - appear slightly depleted (see e.g. Springel
et al. 2008). Nonetheless, even if satellite galaxies are not
simply scaled down versions of their hosts, ΛCDM stipu-
lates that the most massive of the Milky Way (MW) dwarfs

ought to have dark and indeed luminous (e.g. Wheeler et al.
2015) satellites of their own.

The Large Magellanic Cloud is the most massive satel-
lite of the Milky Way and, hence, is an obvious place to probe
the extension of the Cosmological hierarchy to the smallest
galaxy scales. Last year, the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
provided nineteen new entries to the inventory of Galactic
satellites (Koposov et al. 2015a; Bechtol et al. 2015; Drlica-
Wagner et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2015; Kim & Jerjen 2015;
Luque et al. 2015). Given the proximity of the DES sur-
vey area to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC
and SMC, collectively MCs), these new objects appear good
candidates to have been members of the Greater Magellanic
Galaxy, imagined by Lynden-Bell (1976) as the tidally dis-
rupted source of material spanning half the sky, and subse-
quently associated with various satellites of the Milky Way
(Lynden-Bell 1976, 1982; Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell 1995;
D’Onghia & Lake 2008).

Figure 1 is a striking - even if somewhat superﬁcial -
conﬁrmation of the picture conjured by Lynden-Bell (1976).
Here, the on-sky density distribution of the known Galac-
tic dwarf satellites is shown to be dominated by a long
and broad band roughly aligned with the LMC’s proper
motion. Naturally, if the association with the MCs was in-

updated list of McConnachie 2012) within 350 kpc from the MW
centre is shown as a greyscale 2D histogram. The sky is split into
18 pixels along RA and 14 along Dec. Gaussian smoothing with
a FWHM of 1.7 pixels is applied. The red ﬁlled circle marks the
current location of the LMC. The arrow represents the direction

deed real, the over-dense region would be nothing but the
leading (mostly above the Galactic plane) and the trailing
(mostly below) debris tails of the disrupting Magellanic sys-
tem. While this anisotropy has been alluded to on numerous
occasions recently (e.g. Kroupa et al. 2005; Pawlowski et al.
2012), it is rather diﬃcult to assess its true signiﬁcance as
diﬀerent parts of the sky have so far been imaged to dif-
ferent depths. Therefore, to mitigate the selection eﬀects,
we concentrate on the particular patch of the sky where i)
the satellite over-density is at its highest and ii) deep and
contiguous coverage is available, i.e. the DES footprint.

One of the main aims of this work is to establish the
likelihood of association of the DES satellites with the MCs.
One approach in doing this has been to consider analogues
of the LMC in cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-like
halos. Sales et al. (2011) mapped the phase-space distribu-
tion of the subhaloes of one LMC analogue in the Aquar-
ius simulations (Springel et al. 2008) and, though unable to
conﬁrm any clear association with the then known Galactic
satellites, they did predict a concentration of satellites in
the vicinity of the LMC if it has had only one MW pericen-
tric passage. Deason et al. (2015) generalised this by looking
at 25 analogues found in the ELVIS simulations (Garrison-
Kimmel et al. 2014) ﬁnding a trend between LMC accretion
time and the z = 0 phase-space dispersion of its subhaloes.
Their comparison with 9 of the DES satellites suggested a
recent (< 2 Gyr) LMC accretion, and 2-4 satellites of likely
Magellanic origin.

An alternative approach in establishing an association
was taken by Koposov et al. (2015a), who demonstrated
that the region around the LMC is signiﬁcantly over-dense
with satellites under the assumption of an isotropic Galac-
tic distribution. This inconsistency of the DES satellites with
an isotropic MW population is re-iterated in Drlica-Wagner
et al. (2015), who further model the satellites’ 3D spatial dis-
tribution as two spherical components centred on the LMC
and SMC and an isotropic MW background. This suggested

that 20-30% of all known satellite galaxies in the vicinity of
the MW have been associated with the MCs.

The advantage of using zoom-in simulations is that they
paint a self-consistent cosmological picture; the diﬃculty lies
in ﬁnding an LMC analogue with the observed properties.
For example, both Sales et al. (2011) and Deason et al.
(2015) necessarily omit the LMC’s massive companion, the
SMC. Furthermore, a model constructed from an LMC ana-
logue with the incorrect position and velocity cannot take
full advantage of the satellites’ phase-space information, e.g.
Deason et al. (2015) give the probability of association as a
function of 1D distance from the LMC rather than 3D po-
sition. Conversely, the simple 3D model of Drlica-Wagner
et al. (2015) does not include any dynamical eﬀects.

In this work we take a complementary approach, build-
ing a dynamical model which satisﬁes the observed kine-
matics. We do this by performing fast orbit integrations in
analytic potentials, in a similar way to Nichols et al. (2011),
extending the methods used in that work by using an im-
proved dynamical friction model, including the MW’s reﬂex
motion due to the LMC - the importance of which was high-
lighted in G´omez et al. (2015) - and using the most recent
measurements of the Clouds’ proper motions (Kallivayalil
et al. 2013, hereafter K13). We also note the similarity of
our method to Yozin & Bekki (2015).

This paper is organised as follows. First, we give the
details of our simulation setup in Section 2, and describe
the initial conditions, the methods of orbit integration and
the eﬀects of dynamical friction. We present the results of
the spatial distribution modelling of the Magellanic satel-
lites in Section 3 and give the probability of belonging to
the MCs and the MW for each of the recently discovered
objects. Section 4 compares the observed kinematics with
the model predictions and forecasts the line-of-sight veloc-
ities for the objects awaiting follow-up. Taking advantage
of the full simulation suite, we gauge the total mass of the
LMC in Section 5. Finally we discuss the main results and
the limitations of this work and conclude in Section 6.

2 SIMULATIONS

We wish to approximate the z = 0 distribution of satellites
once associated with the MCs. To do this we assume that
satellite dynamics are governed by the gravitational forces of
the MW, LMC and SMC, i.e. we assume that the satellites
can be treated as tracer particles in the combined potential
of the three massive galaxies. This is a reasonable assump-
tion for the satellites we will be considering, which have
luminosities at least 10 magnitudes lower than the SMC.
Having made this assumption we can model the z = 0 Mag-
ellanic satellite distribution by:

(i) initialising the MCs with their observed positions and

velocities today

(ii) rewinding the orbits of the MW, LMC and SMC in
their combined three-body potential, accounting for the ef-
fects of dynamical friction

(iii) introducing a distribution of tracer particles repre-

senting the satellites at some time in the past

(iv) integrating forward the orbits of the tracer particles

in the three-body potential to today

2.1 Galaxy Models

We represent the MW, LMC and SMC with two-component
analytic potentials. The models used are described here and
their parameters are summarised in Table 1.

The ﬁrst component of each galaxy is a Navarro-Frenk-
White (NFW) halo (Navarro et al. 1997). We vary halo virial
(i.e. M200) masses, and assign a mass dependent concentra-
tion
log10 c200 = 1.645 − 0.065 log10 M200,
which is based on the c(M ) relation shown in S´anchez-
Conde & Prada (2014). Compared to the relation shown
there, our Equation (1) takes the mean concentration for
a MW like halo but is less concentrated than a typical
M200 ∼ 109−10M(cid:12) halo. This is required in order that our
MC models do not have masses in tension with observations,
as discussed below.

(1)

The second component of each galaxy is chosen to
satisfy a mass constraint. For the Milky Way we use a
Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disk (Miyamoto & Nagai 1975) with
scale lengths ﬁxed at the values of MWPotential2014 model
described in Bovy (2015), and mass chosen to satisfy the
McMillan (2011) measurement of Vcirc(R(cid:12)) = 239 km s−1
at the solar radius, R(cid:12) = 8.29 kpc. For the LMC we use
a Plummer model (Plummer 1911) of ﬁxed size to sat-
isfy the van der Marel & Kallivayalil (2014) constraint of
M (< 8.7 kpc) = 1.7 × 1010 M(cid:12), and likewise for the
SMC using the Stanimirovi´c et al. (2004) measurement of
M (< 3.5 kpc) = 2.4 × 109 M(cid:12). We use spherical bulges
rather than ﬂattened disks here to avoid the complication of
following disk orientations during galaxy interactions, justi-
fying this departure from reality since we are interested in
the dynamics of satellites in the outer haloes of these galax-
ies, far from their disks.

The only independent parameter varied in our models
is the NFW M200 mass of each galaxy, with ranges shown
in Table 1. We adopt three values for the MW and SMC
(hereafter referred to as Light, Medium and Heavy) and 15
values of LMC mass. We focus our parameter grid this way
since we expect the LMC to exert the dominant force at
the position of many of the observed satellites. With such a

coarse grid in SMC mass, we parametrize it as some fraction
of the LMC - rather than using absolute values - in order
that it exerts similar inﬂuence on the satellite dynamics over
the whole LMC mass range.
For the LMC’s virial mass, our lower bound of 2 ×
1010 M(cid:12) is only slightly larger than the known dynamical
mass (van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014) while our upper
bound of 3× 1011 M(cid:12) is motivated by the Pe˜narrubia et al.
(2016) measurement of the mass of the LMC. This mea-
surement is based on the LMC’s inﬂuence on the barycentre
of the Local Group. We take 15 values of the LMC mass
spaced linearly in this range. The factor of four separat-
ing our lightest and heaviest MWs reﬂects our uncertainty
in this quantity, bounded by values suggested by Gibbons
et al. (2014) and Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2013). With little
prior knowledge of the LMC:SMC mass ratio we take our
smallest ratio to be the 3:1 ratio of their V -band luminosi-
ties (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), and arbitrarily take 10:1
as our most extreme case.

Motivated by the identiﬁcation of the splash-back radius
of cold dark matter haloes beyond which a sharp density
drop is observed (More et al. 2015), we truncate the den-
sity proﬁles of our galaxy models. This physically motivated
truncation also gives more realistic orbits at the large dis-
tances we will consider and gives our NFW proﬁles a ﬁnite
mass. We will require a truncation which gives a continuous
density slope (as discussed in Section 2.4) hence adopt an
exponential truncation following Springel & White (1999),

where ρ(r) is the un-truncated density proﬁle, rT is the trun-
cation radius, rD is a decay radius and  is chosen to give a
continuous slope. The exact value of the splash-back radius
is found to lie in the range 0.8 − 1.5R200 and is a function
of the halo’s accretion history (More et al. 2015). For sim-
plicity, following Kazantzidis et al. (2004), we take a ﬁxed
value of rT = R200 and decay radius rD = 0.1R200.

2.2 Kinematics

The kinematic observations we use for the MCs are shown
in Table 2. Values for the SMC are taken from K13. For
the LMC we use van der Marel & Kallivayalil (2014) over
K13 since the former solves for the proper motion of the
LMC centre-of-mass by simultaneously ﬁtting both proper
motion and radial velocity measurements (PM + Old vLOS
Sample from their Table 1). This is more consistent than the

4

P. Jethwa et al.

approach taken in K13, however the diﬀerence in the ﬁnal
solution is small.

Assuming Gaussian errors on the all values shown in
Table 2, we draw 100 samples from the joint LMC/SMC
distribution and convert them to Galactocentric Cartesian
co-ordinates which form the initial conditions for the MCs
in our simulations. While the MW is initialised at rest at
the origin, it is free to respond to the gravity of the MCs at
later times.

Throughout this work,

for all co-ordinate transfor-
mations we assume the McMillan (2011) measurement of
Vcirc(R(cid:12)) = 239 km s−1 at the solar radius, R(cid:12) = 8.29 kpc,
and the Sch¨onrich et al. (2010) measurement of the sun’s pe-
culiar motion, (U, V, W )(cid:12) = (11.1, 12.24, 2.25) km s−1.

2.3 Dynamical Friction

We include the eﬀect of dynamical friction on the trajec-
tories of our three massive galaxies using Chandrasekhar’s
formula (Binney & Tremaine 2008),

We make the following choices for these quantities. For

while for σ we use the velocity dispersion of its NFW halo,
using the approximate form given by equation 6 of Zentner
& Bullock (2003). For satellite mass we use the M200 of its
dark halo. For the Coulomb logarithm we use



where the use of instantaneous separation, r, in place of
the maximum impact parameter was shown by Hashimoto
et al. (2003) to better reproduce the orbital decay time-scale
compared to using some ﬁxed value.

The length , interpreted as the minimum impact pa-
rameter eﬀectively taking part in dynamical friction, de-
pends on the satellite’s density proﬁle (White 1976). The
scaling  = 1.6rs, where rs is the satellite’s scale length, has
previously been used when modelling the LMC as a Plum-
mer sphere (e.g. Besla et al. 2007; Sohn et al. 2013, K13).
This is derived analytically in Hashimoto et al. (2003), how-
ever they go on to show that  = 1.4rs better ﬁts their
N-body simulation. Given this, and the departure of our
LMC models from Plummer proﬁles, we choose to calibrate
 against N-body simulations of MW/LMC interactions.

To do this, we ran three N-body simulations using the
N-body part of gadget-3 which is similar to gadget-2
(Springel 2005). The LMCs were each made up of an NFW
halo and a Plummer bulge. The NFW components had a
masses of 5, 10 and 15 ×1010M(cid:12) with concentrations of
9.2, 8.66, 9.35 respectively. The Plummer bulges all had
rs = 6.67 kpc with masses of 1.98, 1.41, 1.01×1010M(cid:12) (from

lightest to heaviest LMC) necessary to satisfy the LMC mass
constraint in van der Marel & Kallivayalil (2014). These
were evolved in a halo similar to our Medium MW, with
M200 = 1012M(cid:12) and c200 = 12. We did not include the MW

show the evolution around pericenter of orbital energy (top) and

tions. Dashed lines show the best ﬁtting orbits found by varying
 in the Coulomb logarithm.

disk since it only makes a minor contribution to the density,
and hence to dynamical friction, in the regions of interest.
The NFW halo of the LMC was modelled with 105 particles
with a softening of 200 pc, the Plummer bulge of the LMC
was modelled with 104 particles with a softening of 890 pc
(the optimal Plummer softening from Dehnen 2001). The
NFW halo of the MW was modelled with 106 particles and
a softening of 200 pc. The LMC and MW were initialised
using the procedure described in Kazantzidis et al. (2004).
For the NFW proﬁles, we used a truncation radius of R200
and a decay radius of rD = 0.1R200, extending the proﬁle
to a hard cutoﬀ at R200 + 3rD. For the Plummer proﬁles
embedded in the NFWs we used a hard truncation radius of
R200 + 3rD. We note that we did not adiabatically contract
the NFW when generating the initial conditions so that the
simulations could be directly compared against the model
described in Section 2.5.

The LMCs were initialised at 500 kpc with an entirely
tangential velocity of 32.7 km s−1. A tracer particle on this
orbit would have pericenter at 50 kpc, similar to the real
LMC, after 5.6 Gyr. The MW was initialised at the origin
with zero velocity. Each simulation was run for 7 Gyr and
the orbits of the LMC and MW were computed by locating
their density peaks at each time.

We ﬁt the N-body orbits with MW/LMC orbits calcu-
lated using analytic potentials as described in Section 2.5,
including a dynamical friction force on the LMC and al-
lowing  to vary. Note that in the analytic potential orbits
we include the reﬂex motion of the MW, the exclusion of
which artiﬁcially enhances dynamical friction (White 1983).
We perform the orbit ﬁts in (E, t) space, deﬁning the orbital

Figure 2 shows the N-body and best-ﬁtting analytic po-

ergy and separation as a function of time either side of peri-
center. Note the energy of Equation (5) is deﬁned in the non-
inertial MW frame, resulting in its non-conservation, i.e. the
slow rise seen between 4-5.5 Gyr. The sharp drop in energy
between 5.5-6.5 Gyr is the eﬀect of dynamical friction. For
each of the three LMCs, an  is found which satisfactorily
reproduces the loss of orbital energy and also well describes
the evolution in orbital separation. We summarise the de-
pendence of the optimal  on the NFW scale length rs as

(7)

where scale lengths outside the range 8 < rs/kpc < 14 are
extrapolations beyond our simulated range.

We note that the MW and LMCs used in our N-body
calibration of dynamical friction do not exactly match the
ones we will use in our model of the LMC satellites, i.e. those
in Table 1. We have re-run the N-body simulations with the
MW and LMCs described in Table 1 and ﬁnd a small change
the dependence of  on rs. To check the sensitivity of our
results to our dynamical friction prescription, we re-ran part
of the analysis in Section 3 using the updated  and found no
signiﬁcant change in the LMC and SMC satellite properties.
While Figure 2 shows that our dynamical friction pre-
scription can reasonably reproduce our N-body results, the
application of Chandrasekhar’s formula for soft and massive
galaxies is known to be fraught with uncertainties (White
1983). We acknowledge a number of concerns regarding our
implementation: our extrapolation for  may not be valid,
while our N-body simulations only test one MW host and
one LMC orbit. It is beyond the scope of this work to fully
address all of these issues, however at least for orbits with
a single pericentric crossing, our implementation of Chan-
drasekhar’s formula should capture the magnitude of the
loss of orbital energy.

2.4 Satellite tracers

Our aim is to model the z = 0 distribution of satellites
once associated with either the LMC or SMC. We deﬁne
“satellite once associated with” to mean a satellite galaxy
which at some time in the past was within the virial radius
of its host and has survived as a self-bound entity to z =
0. By restricting to satellite galaxies we can turn to the
properties of subhaloes in cosmological simulations to guide
our assumptions.

To determine when to introduce our satellites, we ask at
what time we expect the MCs to have assembled the bulk of
their subhalo populations. Wetzel et al. (2009) showed that
subhalo occupation number peaks at z ∼ 2.5, albeit for mass

when evolved in their isolated host galaxy. Red shades show the
evolution of the entire population, blue shades show only those
satellites which survive till present day. Dashed lines show the
destruction radius, dotted lines show R200. Note two departures
from orbital isotropy. First, from the onset, due to the density
tapering at large distances, a radial bias exists at r > 2R200.
Second, when satellites are removed within the designated de-
struction radius, a tangential bias sets in at small distances from
the MCs’ centres.

scales an order of magnitude larger than those we consider
for the MCs, with a trend for less massive haloes to have
peak subhalo occupation at earlier times. We therefore take
the earlier time of 11.5 Gyr ago, roughly corresponding to
z ∼ 3, to introduce tracer particles.

For the satellites’ initial spatial distribution we use the
Ludlow et al. (2009) determination of the z = 0 radial num-
ber density proﬁle of all subhaloes of a MW-like host. This
is given by an Einasto proﬁle,

with parameters r−2 = R200 and α = 0.8. We adopt these
values as our “cored ” satellite distribution There are a num-
ber of uncertainties however, in our use of this proﬁle, which
was calculated for MW like host haloes at z = 0, whereas
we initially wish to model lower mass hosts at z ∼ 3. We
therefore also adopt a second, “cusped ” satellite distribution
with Einasto parameters r−2 = 0.1R200 and α = 0.2, which
roughly follows the distribution of dark matter in the NFW
halo, to allow us to gauge the eﬀect of this systematic un-
certainty on our results. The cusped proﬁle is also loosely
motivated by the suggestion from hydrodynamic simulations
that dwarf galaxies exist in a biased population of subhaloes
preferentially concentrated around their host (Sawala et al.
2014). The Einasto α parameters of our cored and cusped
proﬁles bracket that found in the high resolution collisionless
simulations of Springel et al. (2008).

For each MC model described in Section 2.1, we ini-
tially sample 105 radial positions from both the cored and
cusped distributions, out to a maximum radius of 5R200. Al-

lowing for initial radii greater than R200 is a way to include
subhaloes which have not yet been accreted at z = 3 but
are on orbits likely to enter within R200 at some time be-
fore today. Of course, evolving in the external potential of
the MW, many of these budding Magellanic satellites will
never enter the virial radius of their prospective host. We
explicitly exclude these spurious satellites from our results
by insisting that a tracer particle must at some point during
its orbit enter within R200 of its host if it is to be counted
as a satellite.

For both the cored and cusped initial density proﬁles,
and for each MC model, we generate the corresponding
ergodic distribution function by performing an Eddington
inversion (Eddington 1916; Binney & Tremaine 2008) and
checking that the distribution function is nowhere negative.
We note here that the decision to use an exponential trun-
cation, given by Equation (2), over a hard truncation was
driven by the requirement of a continuous density slope when
performing the Eddington inversion. We sample velocities
from the distribution function using the acceptance-rejection
technique (Kuijken & Dubinski 1994), then randomise an-
gles to give initial conditions for a spherical, isotropic, non-
rotating tracer population of satellites.

Figure 3 shows an example of the two initial distribu-
tions, calculated for our 1011M(cid:12) LMC model. We test the
stability of our initial conditions by integrating orbits for 10
Gyr, and plotting the evolution in density and anisotropy
proﬁles of the tracer population at 2 Gyr intervals shown
by the sequence of coloured lines. Both cored and cusped
density proﬁles are suﬃciently stable, with only some mi-
nor evolution observed at small radii for the cored proﬁle.
Within R200 both populations remain isotropic, however at
radii r > 2R200 a radial bias quickly develops. This is due
to the lack of tracers beyond the imposed radial cut oﬀ of
5R200 needed to replenish high angular momentum orbits at
these distances.

To satisfy the criterion of survival until z = 0, we re-
quire that a satellite must not enter within some threshold
“destruction radius” of either MC during its lifetime to avoid
tidal disruption. We pick radii of 5 kpc for the LMC and 3
kpc for the SMC, which are roughly double their respec-
tive half-light radii, recently re-measured in Torrealba et al.
(2016). We assume that this is a reasonable lower bound
for the distance at which tidal disruption occurs, though in
reality this will depend on the satellite’s mass distribution,
with tidal disruption occurring at larger distances for more
extended satellites.

The sequence of blue lines in Fig. 3 show the density and
anisotropy evolution when we only retain satellites which
have survived until the present day. Unsurprisingly, within
R200 these satellites have a tangential bias, since satellites on
very radial orbits are more likely to be tidally disrupted. This
eﬀect is also observed in cosmological simulations (Ludlow
et al. 2009).

2.5 Orbit integrator

Now that we have described our galaxy models and their
satellite distributions, we give the details of our three-body
orbit integration scheme.
Each massive galaxy g ∈ {M, L, S} (where M, L, S stand
for MW, LMC, SMC) is represented by a potential model

Φg(x), position xg(t) and velocity vg(t). We approximate
the acceleration agh(t) of galaxy g due to the force of galaxy
h as the acceleration of a point mass at the position of galaxy
g in the potential of host galaxy h:
agh(t) = −∇Φh(xg(t) − xh(t)).
Note that this approximation is good when the galaxies are
well separated but breaks down when signiﬁcant fractions
of their mass distributions are coincident. Letting aDF
gh be
the dynamical friction drag on galaxy g due to its motion in
galaxy h of Equation (3), the total accelerations of the three
bodies are given by

(9)

aM(t) = aML(t) + aMS(t),
aL(t) = aLM(t) + aLS(t) + aDF
aS(t) = aSL(t) + aSL(t) + aDF

LM(t),
SM(t) + aDF

SL (t),

(10)

(11)

(12)

where we have chosen to include both the dynamical friction
of the MW on both MCs, and the dynamical friction of the
LMC on the SMC. We integrate the equations of motion
using a symplectic leapfrog scheme (Springel et al. 2001)
and adaptive time-steps

(13)

i.e. a hundredth of the shortest dynamical time-scale be-
tween pairs of galaxies. To calculate forces we use the min-
imal C implementations of potentials included in the Galpy
software package (Bovy 2015).

We rewind the three-body orbits to t0 = 11.5 Gyr. At
this time we introduce a tracer particle T with initial con-
ditions

xT(t0) = x(L/S)
vT(t0) = v(L/S)

init + x(L/S)(t0),
init + v(L/S)(t0),

(14)

(15)

init

and v(L/S)

where x(L/S)
are initial conditions sampled from
one of our populations of tracer satellites, which we centre
on the LMC or SMC host as appropriate. Tracer T is inte-
grated forward in the non-static three-body potential, with
acceleration given by

aT(t) = aTM(t) + aTL(t) + aTS(t)

(16)

where we update the positions of the MW, LMC and SMC
by linearly interpolating the stored results of the backwards
integration.

We integrate the tracer orbits forward to today subject
to the following rules. If the tracer ever ventures within the
destruction radius of either the LMC or SMC, we say it
has been tidally destroyed. If the tracer never enters within
R200 of its host, we do not count it as a true satellite. If a
true satellite survives until today we output its position and
velocity, continuing this process until we have output 5000
tracers for each set of our model parameters.

To summarise, of our grid of models comprises

• 135 galaxy mass model combinations
i.e. 3 MWs × 15 LMCs × 3 SMCs
• 100 sampled kinematics for the MCs
• 4 satellite populations
i.e. (cored, cusped) × (LMC, SMC)
• 5000 tracers output for each satellite population

10 Gyr. Each panel shows the distribution of Nperi for a par-
ticular MW/LMC mass combination (masses increasing right-
wards/upwards respectively) and, where visible, broken down by
SMC mass as colours shown in the legend.

The total output is 2.7× 108 tracer particles. Accounting for
tracer particles which enter the destruction radius or never
enter within R200, this requires the calculation of 3.8 × 108
tracer orbits, with a typical run-time of 5× 10−4 s per orbit.

2.6 Orbit Comparison

Before looking at the satellite distributions, we compare our
MW+LMC+SMC orbit integrations with those of K13. Our
method diﬀers from the one employed in that work in nu-
merous ways. In order of importance, these include our use
of:

(i) a non-static MW, free to respond to the LMC’s gravity
(ii) LMC dynamical friction on the SMC
(iii) diﬀerent potential models
(iv) diﬀerent  in Chandrasekhar dynamical friction
(v) van der Marel & Kallivayalil (2014) LMC kinematics

For a subsample of our galaxy mass models, we sample 103
values of the MC kinematics and perform backward orbit in-
tegrations for 10 Gyr, storing various quantities as discussed
below.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the number of peri-
centers undergone between the MW and LMC in the last 10
Gyr, to be compared with Fig. 9 of K13. The results are qual-
itatively similar: Nperi increases as we increase the mass of
the MW and decrease the mass of the LMC. Looking at the
exact numbers predicted, however, we typically predict one
more pericenter than K13 for all LMCs in our 2 × 1012M(cid:12)
MW, and for the lightest LMC in our 1 × 1012M(cid:12) MW.
This is due to our use of a free MW which, as discussed in
G´omez et al. (2015), results in shorter LMC orbital periods.

Figure 5. Time the LMC and SMC remained bound during
their orbit. Each panel shows results as a function of the relative
LMC-SMC proper motion, for a particular MW/LMC mass com-
bination, where we have only considered our light SMC model.
Colours represent the bound time averaged for all orbits in that
proper motion cell.

Importantly, we have checked that artiﬁcially pinning the
MW to the origin reproduces the results of K13.

Figure 5 shows the amount of time the LMC and SMC
were bound during their orbit, deﬁned as in K13 as the
longest duration that the SMC’s orbital energy relative to
LMC is negative. Results are shown for our light SMC
model. The panel with mass combinations most directly
comparable to Fig. 14 of K13 is shown in the lower right.
In both our and K13 distributions, the longest bound states
are found near (µW , µN )(LMC − SMC) ≈ (−1.0, 1.5). Un-
like K13 however, for this particular combination of masses,
we do not ﬁnd any solutions bound for > 2 Gyr, which we
attribute to our inclusion of LMC-SMC dynamical friction.
We do ﬁnd that longer binary states are easily achievable
for lower MW or higher LMC masses, in broad agreement
with Fig. 12 of K13.

3 3D SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION MODEL

Having described our simulations, we will now explain how
we use them to model the 3D spatial distribution of the satel-
lites observed in DES and then compare our model against
the data.

lites in the DES survey (Koposov et al. 2015a; Drlica-Wagner

their luminosity as function of distance, the right panel their
on-sky positions.

To compare our model with the observed satellites re-
quires knowledge of the DES selection function. The esti-
mated detection eﬃciencies of the satellites vary between
1.0 and 0.2 (Drlica-Wagner et al. 2015) dependent on satel-
lite distance, luminosity and size. Given the systematic un-
certainties in determining these parameters (e.g. Koposov
et al. (2015a) and Bechtol et al. (2015) give the luminosity
of Reticulum 2 as MV = −2.7 ± 0.1 and −3.6 ± 0.1 respec-
tively), there will be large uncertainties in reported detection
eﬃciencies. Guided by the sharp boundary between detec-
tion and non-detection in eﬃciency maps calculated for the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (Koposov et al. 2008), we
circumvent this uncertainty by assuming that detection is a
binary decision. Furthermore, we assume that this decision
is determined entirely by distance and luminosity, omitting
any dependence on size. In eﬀect, this means that our re-
sults will not account for any hypothetical population of
undetectably-low surface-brightness dwarfs. Our criteria for
detectability DES is thus

MV < M DES

V,lim(D(cid:12))

= (1.45 − log10(D(cid:12)/kpc))/0.228.

(17)

The slope of this relation is assumed equal to that calculated
for SDSS (Koposov et al. 2009, i.e. Equation (18)) whilst the
intersect is chosen such that all DES satellites lie above this
threshold, as shown in the top left panel of Fig. 6.

In compiling Table 3, we have excluded all likely or
known globular clusters, along with the distant dwarf galaxy
candidate Eridanus 2 which lies beyond the distance range of
our Magellanic satellite distributions (D(cid:12) = 380 kpc). We
also exclude the faintest dwarf candidate Cetus 2, at whose
luminosity (MV = 0 mag) our census of satellites is woefully
incomplete. The inclusion of Cetus 2 would therefore aﬀect
our results in a manner highly dependent on extrapolations
of the luminosity function well beyond current understand-
ing.

To allow for the possibility that some of the observed satel-
lites do not have a Magellanic origin, we include an isotropic
background component of MW satellites in our model. The
radial proﬁle of this component is ﬁxed to the ΛCDM pre-
diction of the distribution of subhaloes, while we allow its
normalisation to vary in a range informed by the number of
dwarfs observed in surveys prior to DES. Here we describe
these choices.

The radial proﬁle of our MW satellite background is
given by the ΛCDM prediction of the number density of sub-
haloes around MW-like host haloes (Springel et al. 2008),
given by an Einasto parameters α = 0.68 and r−2 =
0.81R200, where R200 is the virial radius of our MW model.
We call this (un-normalised) proﬁle νMW(r). In Section 6.1
we will discuss the eﬀect of loosening this assumption on the
radial proﬁle.

We parametrize the normalisation of the MW back-
ground as a fraction of the value required to reproduce the
observed number of dwarfs discovered in SDSS Data Release
5 (DR5, Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008) with luminosities in
the range −7 < MV < −1. These are shown as black points
in Fig. 6 (taken from McConnachie 2012). To determine the
required normalisation we must take into account the de-
tectability threshold of DR5, which can be approximated
as a limiting luminosity as a function of distance (Koposov
et al. 2009),

V,lim(D(cid:12)) = (1.1 − log10(D(cid:12)/kpc))/0.228,

(18)

shown as a black dashed line in the top left panel of Fig. 6.
To determine what fraction of dwarfs are observable
subject to this criterion, we must assume a luminosity func-
tion of dwarf galaxies L(MV ), i.e.
L(MV ) ∝ dn

The ﬁrst term of the right-hand side is given by the sub-
halo mass function, N (M > msub) ∝ m−0.9
sub (e.g. Gao et al.
2004; Springel et al. 2008). For the second term we assume
m∗ ∝ mγ
sub, trying two values γ = 1.9 (Garrison-Kimmel
et al. 2014, from abundance matching) and γ = 3 (Koposov
et al. 2009, from ﬁts to MW dwarfs). Inserting a constant
stellar mass to light ratio and the standard deﬁnition of the
magnitude scale into the third and fourth terms, and intro-
ducing a normalising constant Kγ gives

L(MV ) = Kγ100.36MV /γ.

(20)

where Kγ is chosen to ensure that L integrates to 1 in the
range −7 < MV < −1. The median luminosities for our
two luminosity functions are MV = −2.9 for γ = 3 and
MV = −2.4 for γ = 1.9, i.e. γ = 3 predicts more bright
dwarfs.
The number of observable dwarfs within a distance D(cid:12)
is then given by the integral of the number density over the
DR5 survey volume, V , within that distance, where we inte-
grate the luminosity function down the faintest observable

cluding a 20◦ region either side of the Galactic disc where
detection may be more diﬃcult, exceeds the DR5 area by
a factor of 1.6, but the number of new dwarfs discovered is
a factor of 2 smaller, giving a density less than a third of
that found in DR5. We further highlight this by updating
the bottom left panel with these later discoveries: the new
observed number count (blue histogram), and our model dis-
tribution Nexp (dashed blue line) with a normalisation re-
duced to 1.98 × 10−3 = 0.63NDR5 in order to match the
observed number count within 300 kpc. We then plot the
expected number count of dwarfs over the whole sky given
this normalisation (solid blue line). The dearth of satellites
in these subsequent surveys reduces our prediction of the
total number of MW satellites within 300 kpc from 280 to
180. This reduction of 100 predicted satellites is emphasised
by an arrow in the bottom left panel of Fig. 6.

where V is now the volume within distance D(cid:12) over the
whole sky. For this choice of parameters, we predict 280
dwarfs within 300 kpc in the range −7 < MV < −1.

We will vary the background normalisation about NDR5
to account for possible anisotropy in the MW satellite dis-
tribution. Such anisotropy is already known to exist. We
demonstrate this in Fig. 6 with the addition of dwarf galaxies
discovered in SDSS data releases subsequent to DR5 (Grill-
mair 2009; Belokurov et al. 2009, 2010, blue points), and
the PanSTARRS1 3π survey (PS3π Laevens et al. 2015a,b,

3.2.2 Gaussian Mixture Model

We represent the 3D spatial probability density function
(pdf) of the Magellanic distributions using a Gaussian Mix-
ture Model (GMM) in order to smooth the discrete simula-
tion output. A GMM is a non-parametric density estimator
consisting of a weighted sum of Gaussian components, where
the weights and Gaussian parameters are found by perform-
ing a maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the particle positions output
from our simulations.

For a sample of our simulations we ﬁnd the optimal

number of GMM components, deﬁned as the number which
minimises the Akaike information criterion. Each component
was allowed an unconstrained covariance matrix This opti-
mal number was found to be in the range 7-15, with the
exact solution dependent on a variety of simulation parame-
ters, e.g. LMC satellite distributions which have undergone
1 MW crossing preferred fewer than 10 components, while
those with multiple crossings preferred more than 10. Rather
than performing the costly task of ﬁnding the optimal num-
ber for each particular simulation, we chose to perform our
analysis using 10 components for all of our simulated distri-
butions.

For each combination of mass models we perform a
full expectation-maximization ﬁt for one simulation seeded
from a particular set of MC kinematics, then use the re-
sulting GMM parameters to initialise ﬁts for the remain-
ing simulations which are completed using 30 expectation-
maximization steps. A visual comparison of the samples
drawn from the mixture models with the simulation out-
put demonstrates that this ﬁtting process is suﬃcient to
capture the diﬀerences in distributions as resolved by our
simulations.

3.2.3 Likelihood

We model the observed satellite distribution with three com-
ponents: MW, LMC and SMC. The background MW model
has a radial number density proﬁle,

nMW(r) = fMWNDR5νMW(r),

(23)

where r is Galactocentric distance and fMW is a normal-
isation in units of the SDSS-DR5 satellite density. The
MCs have pdfs, fLMC(x, Θs) and fSMC(x, Θs), estimated
via Gaussian Mixture Model, which are functions of Galac-
tocentric Cartesian satellite position x and are dependent
on simulation parameters Θs = (M, µ) where

M = (MMW, MLMC, MSMC),
µ = (µLMC

W , µLMC

, µSMC

W , µLMC

N

),

(24)

(25)

i.e. the galaxy mass models and the MC proper motions,
respectively. The pdfs further depend on whether the tracer
particles are initialised with either the cored or cusped dis-
tribution. Introducing the parameters NLMC and NSMC,
which we interpret as the total number of satellite galax-
ies which have ever belonged to the LMC or SMC, our
satellite number density model, parametrized by Θ =
(M, µ, fMW, NLMC, NSMC), is given by
F (x, Θ) = nMW(|x|)+NLMCfLMC(x, Θs)+NSMCfSMC(x, Θs).

sitions and luminosities of the 14 satellites in Table 3. In-

3.2.4 Prior PDF

We now deﬁne the prior probability distribution on the
model parameters, P (Θ). We take a uniform prior over our
suite of simulations, in eﬀect imposing a uniform prior over
galaxy mass models (see Table 1) and a Gaussian prior over
proper motion measurements. Our prior on the normalisa-
tion on the MW background fMW is uniform in log in the
range [0.1, 3], where fMW = 1 gives a satellite density com-
parable to that found in SDSS-DR5.

and likewise for the SMC. This prior is uniform in the log
of number of satellite galaxies between zero and an upper
limit which is dependent on the galaxy mass, allowing our
lightest 2×1010M(cid:12) LMC to have up to 20 satellites, whereas
our most massive 3 × 1011M(cid:12) LMC may have up to 300
satellites. We justify this scaling of the feasible number of
satellites with host mass since there is an approximately
linear scaling between the number of subhaloes of a host
halo and the mass of the host observed in ΛCDM simulations
(e.g. Zentner et al. 2005).

As an order-of-magnitude justiﬁcation of our upper
limit on satellite number, we consider the scaling between
the MW and our lightest LMC. Figure 6 shows that the ex-
pected number of satellites within 300 kpc of the MW is
around 200 if we assume a density of satellite galaxies over
the entire sky similar to that found in the SDSS and PS3π
surveys. Our prior allows allow our lightest LMC to have as
many as 20 satellites: a factor of 10 fewer than estimated
for the MW despite being a factor 50 less massive, which we
consider to be a reasonably broad prior given the uncertain-
ties in populating subhaloes with satellite galaxies.

3.3 Results

We now examine the posterior probability distributions of
various parameters of interest. These are calculated by eval-
uating the likelihood function on a grid, then using Bayes’
theorem to calculate posterior probabilities,
P (Θ|dDES) =

L(dDES|Θ)P (Θ)

(cid:82)

then marginalising as appropriate.

Figure 7 shows the marginalised 1D and 2D posterior
pdfs for three of our model parameters: the normalisation of
the MW component, the total number of Magellanic satel-
lites, and the fraction of SMC to LMC satellites. In the 1D
posterior pdfs the black lines show the result marginalised
over two systematic uncertainties tested in our model, i.e.
the initial density proﬁle of MC satellites, and the luminosity
function used.

We ﬁnd that the results are insensitive to the choice of
luminosity function. We show the dependence of the results
on our choice of initial density proﬁle using the coloured
lines in Fig. 7. These show the marginalised posteriors when
we use either the cusped (cyan) or cored (red) proﬁles. We
see that the fully marginalised result more closely follow the
results derived from the cusped proﬁle. This is because, with
9 of our dozen satellites lying within 50 kpc of the LMC, our
ﬁts generically prefer the more centrally concentrated initial
density proﬁle. Having only simulated two density slopes
we refrain from further discussion of the signiﬁcance of this
result. We discuss various other parameters, marginalised
over these systematic uncertainties, below.

Figure 8. 2D satellite membership posterior pdfs, labelled per
panel. The bottom-left/bottom-right/top-left corner of each panel
imply certain membership to the MW/LMC/SMC model compo-
nent respectively. Colours show the logarithmically scaled poste-
rior pdf in the intervening space. Dotted lines demarcate regions
where a satellite is more likely a member of one component than
any other.

3.3.1 The Number of Magellanic Satellites

We constrain the total number of Magellanic satellites to be
70+30
−40, which are the mode and 68% conﬁdence intervals of
the pdf shown in the central panel of Fig. 7. We stress that
this is not an estimate of the number we predict to be still
bound to the MCs today, but refers to the total number of
satellite galaxies which have evolved in the virial radii of
either MC prior to their accretion onto the MW. Many of
these predicted satellites will be in tails of tidally stripped
debris stretching far beyond the current extent of the matter
bound to the MCs.

The bottom right panel of of Fig. 7 shows that we
are unable to constrain the fraction of SMC to LMC satel-
lites. This is in agreement with Drlica-Wagner et al. (2015)
(henceforth DES15).

components of our model distribution, as a function of distance from the relevant host. While there are eight satellites more likely to
have originated in the LMC than the MW, there is only one satellite, Reticulum 3, with a modest probability of originating in the SMC.

3.3.2 The MW background

The left column panel of Fig. 7 shows a preference for a low
MW background. This suggests that most of the DES satel-
lites are unlikely to be drawn from an isotropic MW pop-
ulation. This conclusion was previously reached in DES15
where a simple Kolmogorov-Smirnov test signiﬁcantly re-
jected this hypothesis. This can be seen by eye in the right
panel of Fig. 6, where the on-sky positions of the DES satel-
lites cluster around the MCs.

Quantitatively, our 68% (95%) conﬁdence limits on the
MW background are fMW < 0.40(0.87), in units of the
average satellite density in SDSS-DR5 (discussed in Sec-
tion 3.2.1). We convert this into a constraint on the number
of DES satellites belonging to the MW using the DES15 es-
timate that roughly half of the DES detections would have
been detected in SDSS. Accounting for this extra factor of
two and the DES sky coverage in Equation (21), we arrive
at a 68% (95%) conﬁdence limit that fewer than 4 (8) of the
14 DES satellites shown in Fig. 6 belong to an isotropic MW
background.

Our constraint that fMW < 1 further implies that,
once likely Magellanic satellites are excluded, the underlying
MW satellite population in DES is underdense compared to
SDSS-DR5. The degree of anisotropy is weaker than that
inferred from comparison between SDSS-DR5 and DR10
combined with PS3π (as discussed in Section 3.2.1) and,
of course, presupposes that none of the SDSS-DR5 satellites
themselves have a Magellanic origin.

3.3.3 Magellanic Probability of the DES satellites

We now calculate the probability of each observed satel-
lite belonging to either the LMC or SMC component of our
model. For model parameters, Θ, the probability of a satel-
lite at position x belonging to the LMC component is given
by

pL(x, Θ) =

NLMCfLMC(x, Θs)

F (x, Θ)

,

(31)

where the total model F (x, Θ) is deﬁned in Equation (26).
The SMC membership probability pS(x, Θ) is deﬁned like-
wise. From our simulations, we calculate the probability
P (pL, pS|x, Θ) that a satellite at x has membership proba-
bilites pL and pS for model parameters Θ. The 2D posterior
pdf for a satellite at x to have membership probabilities pL
and pS, marginalised over Θ, is then given by
P (pL, pS|x,dDES) =

where (∗) is given by the denominator of Equation (30).

Figure 8 shows the 2D membership probability pdfs cal-
culated at the position of all 14 DES satellites. Each panel
represents the pdf for an individual satellite. We discuss
three illustrative examples:

• Columba 1’s pdf peaks at PMW = 1 with a little prob-
ability stretching towards LMC membership. Thus, we con-
jecture that Columba 1 is likely a MW satellite.
• Tucana 5’s pdf peaks at PLMC = 1, with a smaller peak
at PMW = 1, and some probability stretching away from the
PMW = 0 axis. It is prudent to suppose that Tucana 5 could
well be stripped from the LMC.
• Reticulum 3’s looks similar to Tucana 5 but has a
prominent streak along PMW = 0, stretching well into the
corner of SMC membership. Therefore, there is some tanta-
lizing evidence the Ret 3 could have been part of the SMC.

The information in Fig. 8 is summarised in Fig. 9 where,
for each DES satellite, we sum the probability in the loci
where it is more likely a member of the MW, LMC or SMC
than either other component (demarcated with dotted lines
in Fig. 8) and plot this as a function of distance from the
relevant host. Note a large number of satellites (likely of the
LMC origin) for which the red ﬁlled symbol (the probabil-
ity of belonging to the LMC) lies above the corresponding
black ﬁlled symbol (the MW membership). For such pairs,

the distances from the LMC and the MW are sorted in an
obvious manner: DLMC < DMW.

Table 4 summarises LMC membership probabilities for
the DES satellites, which we split into three bins comprising
7 likely LMC members, 5 possible members and 2 unlikely
members. Comparing with table 1 of Deason et al. (2015),
we typically assign a slightly greater probability of LMC
membership (∆pLMC ∼ 0.2). We attribute this to the fact
that the relative normalisation of the MW background is a
free parameter in our model, whereas in Deason et al. (2015)
it is ﬁxed by their simulations.

3.3.4 Inﬂuence of the SMC?

Despite not being able to attribute an SMC origin to any of
the DES satellites with a high probability, we can also ask
whether its gravitational force has been inﬂuential for the
orbital history of any of the DES satellites assuming they
have an origin in the LMC satellite population. As a ﬁrst
pass in answering this, we perform a further grid of simula-
tions with no SMC, i.e. we simulate the LMC satellite pop-
ulation in the potential of the MW and LMC only. Then,
over the entire grid of simulations, we calculate the likeli-
hood of the data, dDES, in the two component MW+LMC
model, given by Equation (26) excluding the SMC compo-
nent. Doing this, we discount the possibility that the SMC
has its own satellites, but it still aﬀects results through its
gravitational inﬂuence on LMC satellites.
Starting from a ﬂat prior over the values the mass ra-
tio MLMC/MSMC = (3, 5, 10,∞) (where ∞ means no SMC)
gives a posterior pdf Pposterior = (0.29, 0.26, 0.25, 0.19). The
result does not deviate greatly from the prior, however we
slightly prefer every instance of the LMC populations which
have experienced a massive SMC to those which have not.
This very tentatively suggests that the SMC has had some
inﬂuence over at least one of the DES satellites. We defer
further investigation of this to later work.

3.3.5 Number of MW-LMC Pericenters

We can use the positions of the DES satellites to try to deter-
mine the number of pericenters undergone between the MW
and LMC in the last 11.5 Gyr. Our prior on this quantity,
P (Nperi = n), comes from counting the fraction of MW-
LMC orbits calculated, as described in Section 2.5, which
have exactly n pericenters. Our posterior, given the observed

where the normalisation (∗) is given by the denominator of
Equation (30).

Table 5 shows the results. With the mass models we
have used for the MW and LMC, and the measurements
adopted for the LMC velocity, 64% of our orbit integrations
result in a “ﬁrst-passage” solution, where the LMC has only
recently (<0.1 Gyr ago) completed is ﬁrst pericenter about
the MW. Updated with our knowledge of the positions of
the DES satellites, the probability of a ﬁrst-passage solution
increases to 0.90. This is because at each pericenter the LMC
undergoes an enhanced bout of tidal stripping, making it less
likely to retain the localised concentration of satellites that
has been observed. This echoes the recent result of Deason
et al. (2015), that the DES satellites suggest a recent ac-
cretion of the LMC onto the MW, as well as previous works
which suggested that the LMC is on its ﬁrst infall (e.g. Besla
et al. 2007).

Figure 4 shows that the number of MW-LMC peri-
centers is primarily controlled by the mass of the MW.
Our preference for “ﬁrst-passage” solutions therefore con-
verts into a preference for a low mass MW. For a ﬂat prior
200 = (50, 100, 200)×1011M(cid:12) gives
over the three values, M MW
Pposterior = (0.65, 0.28, 0.07).

3.4 Maximum Likelihood 3D Model

Figure 10 shows the satellite distributions from our maxi-
mum likelihood model. We show the on-sky distribution in
Magellanic Stream (MS) co-ordinates (LMS, BMS) deﬁned
in Nidever et al. (2008), and in Galactocentric r against
LMS in two bins of BMS, for both the LMC and SMC
components. These have been generated from simulations
using a cusped initial satellite distribution, galaxy masses
(MMW, MLMC, MSMC) = (50, 12, 4) × 1010M(cid:12), and com-
bining over all MC proper motions tried. The maximum
likelihood normalisations are fMW = 0.2, NLMC = 70 and
NSMC = 1, for a luminosity function with γ = 1.9. We con-
vert these ﬁgures into the expected number of observed satel-
lites by integrating our satellite density models taking into
account the survey detection limit as given by Equation (17).
Inside the entire DES volume, this results in expected num-
bers of 10.8 observable LMC, 2.7 MW and fewer than 0.1
SMC satellites.

Figure 11 shows the on-sky density of satellites for our
background MW model. The image in (LMS, BMS) shows the

where we have not included a cos(BMS) volume correction
for clarity. Our MW component has a density gradient across
the DES footprint, being ∼ 20% greater in the south west
corner of the DES footprint (i.e. the bottom left corner of
the plot) that the north east. This is due to the relative
proximity of the south west corner to the Galactic center. A
line of sight through this region therefore traverses more of
the MW halo and has a greater probability of encountering
a MW satellite. Our model naturally accounts for this gra-
dient, however we ﬁnd it is not suﬃcient to account for the
observed distribution of the DES satellites and we require a
signiﬁcant Magellanic contribution, as shown in Fig 9.

This maximum likelihood model assigns 12 of the DES
satellites a probability pL > 0.7 of belonging to the LMC,
while the more distant Columba 1 and Indus 2 are most

likely to be MW satellites. The middle left panel of Fig. 10,
we see that see that the distance of Reticulum 3 coincides
with the peak of the distribution of SMC satellites, making
it the only DES satellite with a non-negligible probability
of belonging to the SMC. All other satellites are much more
likely to belong to the background MW population than to
the SMC.

Most of the remainder of the predicted LMC satellites
are located in a leading arm of debris stretching out behind
the Galactic disk. This is shown in equatorial co-ordinates in
Fig. 12, along with the footprints of SDSS, DES and ATLAS
(Shanks et al. 2015) surveys. Much of the predicted lead-
ing arm is currently lacking contiguous coverage, potentially
making the high Galactic latitude portion of the area shown
in the ﬁgure a fruitful region for future satellite searches.
Curiously, despite a rather patchy sky coverage, the Survey
of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH; PI D. Nidever)
has already serendipitously unearthed the Hydra II dwarf
galaxy (Martin et al. 2015) at a position consistent with the
LMC leading tail. The Galactocentric distances of our sim-

albeit extending as far as 300 kpc.

While our model can reproduce the number of satel-
lites discovered, there is tension regarding their distribution
within the DES footprint. The top right panel of Fig. 10
shows that our model predicts a concentration of satellites
within 10 kpc of the LMC, which is not present in the data.
This might be a result of our over-simplistic treatment of the
tidal disruption of satellites. The stellar disk of the LMC ex-
tends beyond 10 kpc from its centre (e.g. van der Marel &

jection of the volume limited by the DES footprint is shown in
grey-scale. The top right panel shows the distribution of root-
mean-squared distances of groups of 7 low BMS satellite analogues
from our simulations, with the observed value in red. We conclude
that the observed plane has a signiﬁcance of 95%

Kallivayalil 2014), hence satellite destruction is likely to oc-
cur at distances greater than the 5 kpc zone-of-avoidance
we have naively imposed in our model. For our maximum
likelihood model, the fraction of particles today within 10,
15 and 20 kpc of the LMC is 3, 8 and 14 % respectively; ac-
counting for destruction of satellite which have, at any time,
entered within these distances would reduce our prediction
of the total number of Magellanic satellites by at least these
proportions.
A further failure of our model is the under-prediction
of satellites in the range −30◦ < BMS < −10◦. Our maxi-
mum likelihood model predicts 1.2 satellites in this range,
whereas 7 are observed. Even allowing for the possibility
that some of these belong to a background MW population,
this suggests an over-density of satellites in a small spa-
tial region compared to expectations from the disruption of
an isotropic LMC satellite population. Furthermore, despite
their on-sky proximity to the SMC, Fig. 9 shows that 5 of
these 7 low BMS satellites (Tucana 2-5 and Grus 2) are in
fact the least likely candidates to have belonged to the SMC.
This is due to their distances (r < 60 kpc) being incompat-
ible with satellites stripped from the SMC halo, as seen in
the bottom left panel of Fig. 10.

3.5 A Plane of LMC Satellites?

We now investigate this hint of an anisotropy in the LMC
satellite population. We investigate whether the seven DES
satellites observed at BMS < 0◦ reside in a coherent struc-
ture, namely a thin plane as has been observed amongst the

satellites of both the MW (e.g. Kroupa et al. 2005) and M31
(Ibata et al. 2013). We test 104 normal vectors spaced uni-
formly around the unit sphere to ﬁnd the plane containing
the LMC which minimises the root-mean-squared (rms) dis-
tance of the seven BMS < 0◦ DES satellites. The resulting
plane has an rms thickness of 2.7 kpc, with a radial extent
of 90 kpc to the most distant satellite, Grus 1. The SMC has
a minimum distance of 2.0 kpc from the plane.

Figure 13 shows the satellite distribution in Galacto-
centric Cartesian co-ordinates ( ˆX, ˆY , Z), which have been
rotated by 20.94◦ about the Z-axis such that the best-ﬁt
plane is edge-on in the ( ˆX, Z) projection. We also show the
projection of the volume limited by the DES footprint, which
appears to coincide with the plane in the ( ˆX, Z) projection.
This is a mere coincidence, since the low BMS satellites do
not lie near the footprint edges, as can be seen in Fig. 10.

We test the signiﬁcance of this observed satellite plane
by comparing to our simulations. We take our maximum
likelihood model and consider all the particles representing
LMC satellites in the box −50◦ < LMS < −25◦, −30◦ <
BMS < −10◦, which number around 104. We then consider
104 random samples of 7 of these particles, insisting that the
particle furthest from the LMC has a distance within 90-
100 kpc, similar to Grus 1 at 93 kpc. We perform the same
plane ﬁtting procedure on the random samples as with the
observed satellites. The top right panel of Fig. 13 shows the
distribution of the resulting rms distances. Finding a plane
at least as thin as the one observed occurs 5% of the time
when sampling from our simulations, i.e. the plane has a
signiﬁcance of 95%.

This calculation does not take into the account the fact
that some of the low BMS satellites may not be genuine
LMC satellites. Figure 9 shows that three of these (Tucana
3, Grus 1 and Grus 2) have MW membership probabilities
> 0.5. None are likely SMC candidates. Accounting for their
uncertain origin, then, would increase the signiﬁcance (and
coincidental nature!) of the observed LMC satellite plane,
since the distance distribution of MW satellites is broader
than that of LMC satellites.

The observation of this plane is thus quite surprising.
Given a population of satellites which is initially distributed
isotropically about the LMC, then evolved in the combined
potentials of the MW, LMC and SMC, it is a rare occu-
rance to ﬁnd 7 satellites - selected on similar criteria to the
observed ones - exhibiting the observed degree of planarity.

4 MODEL FOR THE VELOCITY

DISTRIBUTION

We now consider the velocity information contained in our
model. To recap, the velocities of our simulated satellite are
composed of the orbital velocity of the LMC or SMC about
the MW (or indeed the SMC about the LMC), a dispersion
inherent in our simulated MC haloes, and a component in-
duced by the potential of the MW for any satellite which
has been, or is in the process of being, tidally stripped from
its host. In addition to their conﬁguration-space positions,
satellite velocity information can act as a discriminant of
membership to the MCs, and trace the gravitational poten-
tial of their host at distances unprobed by other luminous
tracers.

coloured symbols show the positions of four DES satellites (given
in the legend of Fig. 9), large/small white circles show the position

In this section we will look at the phase-space dis-
tribution of our maximum likelihood model, then derive
marginalised velocity predictions for the DES satellites as-
suming their membership to the MCs.

4.1 Maximum Likelihood Model for Kinematics

Figure 14 shows a projection of the phase-space distribution
of the LMC and SMC satellite populations of our maximum
likelihood model deﬁned in Section 3.4. We show the dis-
tribution in LMS against vGSR, the line-of-sight velocity in
the Galactic standard of rest (GSR). We also show the posi-
tions of the MCs and the positions of the four DES satellites
with measured line-of-sight velocities which are given in the
rightmost column of Table 6.

Viewed in this projection, all four DES satellites with
measured velocities appear consistent with the simulated
LMC satellite distribution. Furthermore, Tucana 2 and Grus
1 (at LMS ≈ −40◦) have more negative velocities than
Horologium 1 and Reticulum 2 (at LMS ≈ −20◦). This is
consistent with the velocity trend seen in the simulated trail-
ing arm of LMC satellites, bolstering the case for their mem-
bership to this population.

4.2 Comparison to HI gas

Figure 14 also shows is the distribution of HI gas taken from
Nidever et al. (2008) overplotted as black contours. Contour
levels step logarithmically, with line thickness representing
density projected in the (LMS, vGSR) plane. This distribution
comprises gas within the LMC and SMC, a bridge of gas

longitudes LMS < 0◦, and a few complexes comprising the
Leading Arm (LA) at longitudes LMS > 0◦.

We see that the MS gas (at LMS < 0◦) is systematically
oﬀset from the observed LMC satellite velocites by some 100-
150 km s−1. Assuming a scenario where the LMC originally
played host to some or all of the MS gas (as proposed in
Nidever et al. 2008), and the satellites (as proposed here),
this oﬀset may be the result of ram-pressure stripping of
the MS gas by the hot MW halo gas, an eﬀect to which the
satellite orbits remain impervious.

Alternatively, this oﬀset may be the result of the MS
originating in the SMC rather than the LMC. Indeed, the
models of both Besla et al. (2012) and Diaz & Bekki (2012)
show that tidal stripping of gas from the SMC is able to re-
produce morphological and kinematic properties of the MS.
Though these models tidally strip gas from a rotating SMC
disc, whereas we strip satellites from an isotropic spherical
distribution, the fact that the MS and our simulated SMC
satellite kinematics are broadly comparable, as shown in the
top panel of Fig. 14, is reassuring.

We also mention the recent MS production model of
Hammer et al. (2015), which invokes a collision between the
MCs and ram-pressure stripping to successfully reproduce
many morphological and kinematic properties of the MS.
Given the inability of ram-pressure to pull gas in front of
the MC orbits, they propose that the Leading Arm (LA)
may be the result of “successive passages of leading, small
dwarfs that have lost their gas from ram pressure”. Fig. 10
shows that the on-sky positions of the gas complexes com-
prising the LA are comfortably within the scope of our sim-
ulated LMC satellite distribution, hence we believe that the
LA production scenario described in Hammer et al. (2015)
is well accommodated in the picture of Magellanic group in-
fall. Hammer et al. (2015) presuppose that the inferred time
gap between the arrival to the MW of the dwarfs and the
MCs precludes their belonging to group, however this fails
to consider the possibility of very massive (M200 > 1011M(cid:12))
and extended LMC dark halo.

4.3 Velocity predictions

We now predict the velocities of the DES satellites under
the assumption that they were members of one of the MCs,
marginalised over our entire grid of models. For each of our
simulations, Θ, we approximate the local velocity distribu-
tion at position x assuming membership to the LMC popu-
lation - which we call P (v|x, Θ, LMC) - as a normal distribu-
tion with mean and standard deviation given by the veloci-
ties of the ten LMC satellite tracers nearest to x, excluding
any three-sigma velocity outliers. We then marginalise over
model parameters to give velocity pdfs for a satellite at x,
assuming it belongs to the LMC,
P (v|x, dDES, LMC) =

where (∗) is the denominator of Equation (30), and we have
also incorporated the information provided by the positional
data dDES. We derive velocity prediction assuming SMC
membership similarly.

of the DES satellites as labelled in each panel. The y-axis ranges
from 0 to 0.007 in each panel. The red/cyan distributions are
predictions assuming membership to the LMC/SMC populations.
The black vertical lines show measured values.

Table 6 shows our resulting predictions the for line-of-
sight velocity and two components of proper motions in the
solar rest-frame. We report the maximum likelihood values
along with the 68% and 95% conﬁdence intervals. The right-
most column shows measured values where available. Fig 15
shows the predictions assuming LMC membership, trans-
formed into GSR, for the four satellites with measured line-
of-sight velocities. The breadth of these distributions is due
to the combination of the inherent velocity dispersion in our
MC haloes and the spread in possible MC orbital histories.
We see that all four measured velocities are consistent with
being drawn from the LMC population at the 2σ level. In
particular, Horologium 1 lies at the peak of its LMC satellite
velocity prediction, taking its probability of LMC member-
ship beyond reasonable doubt.

The bottom panel of Fig. 15 shows the predictions for
Reticulum 3, the one satellite with a reasonable chance of
belonging to the SMC population based on its position, ac-
cording to Fig. 9. Though the velocity distributions assum-
ing LMC and SMC membership are somewhat coincident, a
measurement of vGSR > 100 km s−1 (i.e. vhel > 270 km s−1)
for Reticulum 3 would increase the likelihood of its belong-
ing to the SMC. As will discuss in Section 6, proper motions
would also help us understand their origin.

5 THE MASS OF THE LMC

While the enclosed mass of the LMC is well constrained at
M (< 8.7 kpc) = (1.7 ± 0.7) × 1010M(cid:12) (van der Marel &
Kallivayalil 2014), its total mass remains largely unknown.
Abundance-matching would suggest that a galaxy with the
stellar mass of ∼ 2.9 × 109M(cid:12), equal to that of the LMC’s
(van der Marel et al. 2002), are likely to reside in haloes
with a virial mass of 2 × 1011M(cid:12) (Moster et al. 2013). Ev-
idence for such a mass, however, is scarce. Circumstantial

evidence comes from models of the Magellanic Stream for-
mation which require the LMC and SMC to form a long-lived
binary pair (Besla et al. 2012), which is the favoured sce-
nario for > 1011M(cid:12) LMCs (K13). Pe˜narrubia et al. (2016)
attempted a direct measurement by modelling the LMC’s
dynamical eﬀect on galaxies in the Local Volume. They in-
ferred a mass 2.5 ± 0.9 × 1011M(cid:12), but stressed this result
must be treated with caution due to the simplifying assump-
tions necessary in their analysis.

The LMC’s satellite galaxies, acting as tracers of its
gravitational potential at large distances, oﬀer a new line of
inquiry. Having demonstrated, in Section 3, that many of
the DES satellites have a high probability of belonging to
such a population of LMC satellites, we will now try to use
them to infer the LMC mass.

5.1 MLMC estimate based on positions only

We ﬁrst ask what constraints we can put on the LMC mass
before assuming membership or otherwise of any satellite
to the LMC population. We calculate the posterior pdf of
MLMC from our three component (MW+LMC+SMC) 3D

spatial distribution model

where (∗) is the denominator of Equation (30).

(36)

The top panel of Fig. 16 shows the result. The poste-
rior is broadly ﬂat, which may be expected when attempt-
ing to constrain a galaxy’s mass without the use of veloc-
ity information. There is, however, a small peak between
4 ≤ MLMC/1010M(cid:12) ≤ 6 whose origin we brieﬂy discuss.

The constraining power at the low mass end is the com-
bined result of two eﬀects. Firstly, our lowest mass LMC
model is likely to play host to the fewest number of satel-
lites, which we impose via the prior shown in Equation (29).
Secondly, the same LMC is also the most likely to undergo
multiple pericentric passages with the MW, seen in Fig. 4, as
a result of the mass dependence of dynamical friction. The
likely fate for the relatively few satellites of a 2 × 1010M(cid:12)
LMC, then, is to be tidally stripped from their host during a
previous close approach with the MW, in slight tension with
the observed concentration of satellites around the LMC.

The constraining power at the high mass end comes
from the extent of the observed satellite distribution. As
can be seen in Fig. 9, 12 out of 14 DES satellites are within

where Equation (28) refers to the original likelihood us-
ing just positional data, FL(x) is LMC component of our
satellite distribution model given by Equation (26), and
P (v|x, Θ, LMC) are the the local velocity distributions ap-
proximated from the simulations as described in Section 4.
We calculate posteriors on MLMC using this new likelihood.
The bottom two rows of Fig. 16 show the result when we
include velocity information. In each panel the dashed and
dotted lines show the results when we use the cored or cuspy
satellite populations respectively, while the solid line shows
the marginalised result. As in Fig. 7, the mean posterior
closely follows the results using the cusped proﬁle since these
typically provide better ﬁts to the data. Despite the variation
between results dependent on our choice of initial satellite
density proﬁle, and a level of noise seeded from noise in our
simulations, we ﬁnd that some trend persists.
The addition of the 3 velocities of likely LMC satellites
leads us to slightly favour masses MLMC < 14 × 1010M(cid:12).
This weak upper bound is mainly driven by Horologium
1 which, as discussed in Koposov et al. (2015b), has a
line-of-sight velocity just 15 km s−1 discrepant from the
value expected at its position if it were stationary with
respect to the LMC. Such a low relative velocity is more
likely to occur in lighter LMCs, which have smaller halo
velocity dispersions. The addition of Grus 1 to our veloc-
ity sample creates a peak in the posteriors in the range
10 ≤ MLMC/1010M(cid:12) ≤ 12, and leads us to strongly dis-
favour the lightest LMC, MLMC = 2×1010M(cid:12), which we dis-
cuss below. Assuming all four satellites do indeed belong to
the LMC, the most likely value and 68% conﬁdence interval
for the LMC halo mass is given by MLMC = 12+8

−7×1010M(cid:12).

5.3 Grus 1

Figure 17 demonstrates how the inclusion of Grus 1 imposes
a lower bound on the LMC mass. We take simulations of a
light and heavy LMC, with masses of 2 and 12 ×1010M(cid:12)
respectively, with all other model parameters kept ﬁxed. For
particles inside the DES footprint, we plot the phase space
distributions in Galactocentric r against vGSR, and over-
plot the phase space positions of the DES satellites with
measured velocities. At the distance of Grus 1, the satellite
distribution for the light LMC does not extend to suﬃciently
negative velocities to accommodate Grus 1, yet it is well
within the scope of the heavy LMC’s distribution.

There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the satellites of
the heavy LMC comprise a hotter population than those of
the light LMC, ﬁlling a larger volume of the available phase
space. The second reason is due to the mass dependence of
the LMC’s orbital history, demonstrated in the right panel
of Fig. 17 where we compare the past orbits of the light LMC
(dashed line) with that of the heavy LMC (solid line). Both
are calculated in the potential of our Light MW model for
z = 0 velocities given by the central values in Table 2. Inte-
grating backwards from this ﬁxed velocity, dynamical fric-
tion accelerates the LMC along its orbit. The heavy LMC,

100 kpc of the LMC, while 9 are within 50 kpc. Given that
our simulated satellite distributions extend out to the virial
radius of their host, we slightly disfavour very massive LMCs
which have virial radii extending far beyond the observed
satellite distribution.

5.2 MLMC estimate using velocity information

We now make the assumption that some of the DES satellites
are indeed satellites of the LMC, and use their measured ve-
locities to constrain its mass. Section 3.3.3 shows that based
on their 3D positions alone, of the four satellites with mea-
sured velocities, three are likely members of the LMC while
one, Grus 1, is a possible member. We therefore perform
this analysis both with and without Grus 1. It is important
to note that our assumption here is that the satellites have
existed in the LMC halo at some point, not the stronger
statement that they are still bound to the LMC today. Our
simulations explicitly include satellites which have been, or
are currently being, tidally stripped from the LMC by the
MW.

To incorporate the velocity information we deﬁne a new
likelihood function. Of the 14 satellites whose positions in
Section 3, we have now assumed that N of these, which have
measured velocities, are LMC satellites. Our new, combined
data set thus comprises

(i) dL = {xL, MV,L, vL}: the positions, luminosities and
(ii) d = {x, MV }: the positions and luminosities of the

velocities of N satellites assumed to belong to the LMC

experiencing more dynamical friction than the light, thus has
a larger (i.e. more negative) velocity than the light LMC at
the same radius. This is reﬂected in the mean velocities of
their satellite distributions.

We now re-consider Grus 1’s inclusion in our velocity
sample. Figure 9 suggests that based on its position, Grus
1 is almost as likely to be a MW as an LMC satellite. We
draw some reassurance that the latter is true from Grus 1’s
velocity, which appears in Fig. 17 to lie above the escape
velocity of a M200 = 1012M(cid:12) NFW halo. Boylan-Kolchin
et al. (2013) (henceforth BK13) showed that it is vanish-
ingly rare for a host halo to contain an unbound subhalo
within ∼ 1.5 virial radii. Assuming a virial mass no greater
than than 1012M(cid:12) for the MW - as has been inferred using
stellar tracers (e.g. Williams & Evans 2015), tidal streams
(e.g. Gibbons et al. 2014) and Local Group kinematics (e.g.
Diaz et al. 2014) - this implies that Grus 1 is very unlikely
to belong to the MW population. Instead, the apparent “un-
boundedness” of Grus 1 is likely the result of its recent accre-
tion in a massive group. At z = 0, such an event is underway
in one out of six simulated haloes in BK13; the LMC serves
as an analogous host to Grus 1 in the MW.

On a similar note, in order to explain the high 3D ve-
locity of Leo I (Sohn et al. 2013), BK13 proposed the al-
ternative hypothesis that the MW halo is signiﬁcantly more
massive than 1012M(cid:12). It may be necessary to re-visit this
conclusion in light of our inference from Section 3.3.1 that
∼ 45 satellites have been accreted with the MCs, i.e. there
likely exists a signiﬁcant contamination to the MW satellite
population.

5.4 Meaning of the Derived Mass

The mass constraints we have derived for the LMC (see Fig.
16) raise the question, how does this mass correspond to the

LMCs mass today? The LMC mass we use in our simulation
aﬀects the satellite distribution today in two ways.

Firstly, the LMC mass aﬀects the dynamics of the MW
and LMC (and SMC). As we discussed in Section 2.1, we use
a constant mass for the MW and LMC (and SMC) during
their 10 Gyr evolution. While their real masses are evolv-
ing over these timescales, if the mass which will eventually
accrete onto the MW remains within the LMC’s orbit and
is reasonably isotropic for most of this time, we can think
of the MW as having a constant mass. Such reasoning also
explains why the Timing Argument, which models the MW
and M31 as un-evolving point-masses for the age of the Uni-
verse, provides a good estimate for the mass of the Local
Group (Li & White 2008). Such an argument also holds for
the LMC. Thus, the mass inferred from the LMC’s dynamics
should be similar to the LMC’s total mass before it began
disrupting in the MW.

Secondly, the LMC’s mass aﬀects the number of LMC
satellites, the radial distribution of these satellites, and their
subsequent dynamical evolution. The number of satellites
assigned to the LMC is guided by the maximum number
of satellites the LMC had which is controlled by the LMC
mass before it began disrupting in the MW. Similarly, the
radial proﬁle of the satellites around the LMC is controlled
by properties of the LMC before infall onto the MW. The
eﬀect of the LMC’s mass on the satellite’s dynamics is diﬃ-
cult to gauge since much of the satellite stripping can occur
within the MW potential, when the LMC has been substan-
tially stripped. Thus, we expect the LMC mass constraints
derived here to correspond to the LMC’s mass shortly be-
fore it began disrupting in the MW. We will compare the
mass estimate here against cosmological zoom-in situations
in future work.

We have built a dynamical model of the satellite populations
of the MCs based on their observed kinematics and incor-
porating assumptions based on the results of cosmological
simulations where required. Speciﬁcally, our model includes
the response of the MW to the in-falling MCs as well as
the eﬀects of the dynamical friction acting on the Clouds.
Given that the initial intrinsic density distribution of the
satellites in each of the Clouds is unknown, we have allowed
for two distinct radial proﬁles. Finally, we have emulated the
eﬀects of tidal shredding by introducing a destruction region
within each Cloud. Our numerical simulation suite samples
over the proper motion values allowed by the recent HST ob-
servations of the MCs and runs across a range of masses for
each of the 3 galaxies (the MW, the LMC and the SMC). We
compared this model against the satellites discovered in the
DES survey. Here we summarise our results, after discussing
the limitations of our model.

6.1 Shortcomings

First and foremost, our simulations lack any treatment of the
mass evolution of the MW, LMC or SMC over their 11.5 Gyr
timespan. A self-consistent treatment of this eﬀect requires
the use of zoom-in high-resolution N-body simulations, but
given our wish to prioritise observed MC kinematics, coupled
with the dearth of LMC analogues in simulated MW-like
haloes (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2013), this precludes the use
of such simulations here.

An alternative approach to model the MW mass evo-
lution is to vary the parameters of analytic potentials (e.g.
as in Yozin & Bekki 2015). We have chosen against doing
this because the majority of our parameter space has the
LMC on its ﬁrst passage about the MW and for these cases,
the mass which the MW will accrete prior to the arrival of
the LMC will at all times have been contained within the
LMC’s orbit. Assuming, for lack of better constraints, that
this mass is isotropically distributed about the MW we may
as well assume it has been concentrated at the MW for the
entirety of the time considered. Such reasoning also explains
why the point mass approximation provides a good estimate
to the mass of the Local Group when employed in the Tim-
ing Argument (Li & White 2008).

For solutions with multiple LMC pericenters, K13 ﬁnd
that including MW mass growth increases the LMC’s orbital
period by ∼ 30% and eccentricity by ∼ 10%. From our N-
body experiments described in Section 2.3, we ﬁnd similar
deviations arise due to the force of tidally stripped LMC ma-
terial on its bound core. Though simple prescriptions exist
for modelling tidal mass loss (e.g. Zentner & Bullock 2003)
and the role of tidally stripped material on subsequent or-
bital evolution (e.g. Fellhauer & Lin 2007), their eﬃcacy for
massive, LMC-like halos is questionable. Pending the de-
velopment of more robust models at these mass scales, the
trustworthiness of our calculated orbits beyond a few Gyr
remains in doubt.

Having said this, since our MC models are grounded in
their observed kinematics, revisions to their orbital history
will least aﬀect the distribution of satellites which have been
stripped most recently from - or indeed are still bound to
- the MCs. On average, these are the satellites nearest by.

A Magellanic Origin of the DES Dwarfs

21

Given the proximity of the DES satellites to the LMC - with
9 out of 14 within 50 kpc - unless explicitly stated below, we
believe that our results should be robust to such revisions of
the MC orbital histories.

Another limitation of our simulations is that, by repre-
senting satellites as tracer particles, they do not allow for
satellite-satellite interactions. In the mass regime of ultra-
faint dwarfs, ∼ 3% of dwarf satellites in MW-like halos have
undergone a major merger since z = 1 (Deason et al. 2014),
which we consider this a small eﬀect justiﬁably omitted from
our model. We note however, the incidence of satellite merg-
ers increases for more massive satellites (Wetzel et al. 2015).
Lastly, our model assumes that the radial distribution
of MW dwarfs follow the radial distribution of subhaloes
in ΛCDM. This assumption is largely untested. The bot-
tom left panel of Fig. 6 shows that dwarfs in SDSS-DR5
(grey histogram) appears more centrally concentrated than
the ΛCDM prediction, even when accounting for observa-
tional limits (black dashed line). Although the addition of
baryons to ΛCDM suggests a ﬂatter, rather than more con-
centrated, distribution of subhaloes (D’Onghia et al. 2010),
we investigate how our conclusions change when we re-run
our analysis using a more concentrated distribution of MW
satellites (Einasto with parameters α = 0.4 and r−2 = 50
kpc, the result of a maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the SDSS-
DR5 dwarfs in Fig. 6). Our prediction for the probability of
an LMC origin for any of the DES satellites drops signiﬁ-
cantly: our 4 best LMC candidates have membership prob-
abilities 0.3 < pL < 0.6, as opposed to 7 with pL > 0.7 in
the earlier analysis. Interestingly, however, our posterior on
the total number of Magellanic satellites retains a peak at
∼70. In short, models with a Magellanic contribution are
still preferred to explain the DES satellites. To break the
degeneracy between the relative sizes of the MW and LMC
contributions will likely require simultaneous consideration
of the dwarf population over the whole sky.

6.2 Principal results

Our main conclusions are summarised below (errors repre-
sent 68% conﬁdence intervals, unless stated otherwise):

(1) The MW dwarf galaxy population, if assumed to fol-
low the ΛCDM radial subhalo distribution, is unable to
reproduce the satellite counts observed in DES. Our 68%
(95%) conﬁdence limits on the contribution of such a Galac-
tic component to the number of satellites observed in DES
is fewer than 4 (8) out of the 14 considered. The posterior
probability distribution for the MW contribution is shown
in the left column of Figure 7.

(2) The MCs have been accreted onto the MW with 70+30
−40
satellite galaxies (middle column of Figure 7), many of which
should reside in the leading arm of debris stretching behind
the Galactic plane. Figure 12 shows exactly where on the sky
one should search to maximize the chances of uncovering this
missing population.

(3) Based on their 3D positions, of the 14 dwarf galaxy
candidates discovered in the DES survey, 12 are possible
(p > 0.5) and 7 are likely (p > 0.7) members of the LMC
satellite population (see Figures 8 and 9, as well as Table 4).
For the four satellites where data is available, all have veloc-
ities consistent with being LMC satellites (see Figure 15).

P. Jethwa et al.

(4) The inﬂuence of the SMC on the properties of the
Magellanic satellite population is minor in our numerical ex-
periment. As a result the total number of the SMC satellites
is unconstrained (see right panel of Figure 7). There is, how-
ever, a weak indication that Reticulum 3 could be considered
as a possible candidate (p = 0.3) to be an SMC satellite. A
measurement of vhel > 100 km s−1 would strengthen this
case (see Fig. 15).

(5) The newly discovered satellites do not uniformly cover
the entire DES footprint: this strong apparent concentra-
tion of dwarfs around the LMC strengthens the case (∆p =
+0.26, p = 0.90) that the LMC has completed exactly one
pericentric passage with the MW (see Table 5).

(6) Seven of the DES satellites considered have correlated
on-sky positions. Surprisingly, these lie in a 3 kpc thick,
90 kpc wide plane passing through the LMC. If we assume
that the satellites are drawn from a population initially dis-
tributed isotropically about the LMC, then evolved to today
in the potentials of the MW, LMC and SMC, the probability
that this is a chance occurrence is p = 0.05. The SMC lies
only 2 kpc from this plane.

−7 × 1010M(cid:12). The necessary assumption here is that the

(7) Assuming that the four satellites with measured ve-
locities are associated with the LMC (for which pprior > 0.7
in three cases and pprior = 0.6 for Grus 1) we can de-
rive a constraint on the mass of the LMC halo of M200 =
12+8
satellites have evolved within the LMC halo prior to their
arrival at the MW, not that they are still bound to the
LMC today. The lower bound rests on Grus 1 taking part in
the Magellanic in-fall. Furthermore, given Grus 1’s relatively
large distance of ∼90 kpc from the LMC, this constraint is
the one most sensitive to possible revisions to the orbital
histories of the MCs.

6.3 Discussion

To verify the Magellanic origin hypothesis, accurate 3D kine-
matics of the newly detected satellites ought to be collected.
As we show above, radial velocities are discerning as the de-
bris follow a particular track in phase-space. However, given
that most of the dwarfs are at distances of order 50 kpc or
further, the information as to the exact direction in which
they are traveling is encoded in the satellites’ proper mo-
tions. It is therefore the astrometric eﬀorts, both current
utilising the HST (see e.g. Kallivayalil et al. 2013; Sohn et al.
2013; Bellini et al. 2014) as well as the forthcoming ones
taking advantage of Gaia and the LSST, that are of utmost
importance. To facilitate the hypothesis testing, we list the
predicted satellites’ line-of-sight velocities and proper mo-
tion values in Table 6.

While it is plausible that the LMC contributed signif-
icantly to the tally of the Galactic satellites by providing
∼70 low-luminosity galaxies within the MW virial radius,
it is unlikely to be responsible for the overall anisotropy of
the dwarf distribution around us. As clearly illustrated in
Figures 6 and 7, the SDSS-DR5 region of the sky appears
to be overdense in satellites compared to the SDSS-DR10
area increment, as well as the PS3π and DES footprints. We
can calculate the number of the SDSS-DR5 objects falling
within the portion of the sky enclosing the bulk the Mag-
ellanic debris in our simulations. The pole of the best ﬁt-
ting debris plane is given by (l, b) = (353◦,−12◦) (see also

Figure 12). Within ±20◦ of this plane, however, there are
only 2 faint (i.e. not classical) satellites - Leo IV and Leo
V. Moreover, the direction of motion of this pair could be
incompatible with that of the MCs, as recently speculated
by Torrealba et al. (2016). Accordingly, as far as the ultra-
faint dwarf galaxies are concerned, their on-sky distribution
appears to be much broader than the tidal tails associated
with the LMC accretion. The asymmetric shape of the dis-
tribution is perhaps more consistent with the (ubiquitous
in ΛCDM) ﬁlamentary accretion rather than a recent group
in-fall scenario.

Nonetheless, the anisotropy of the Galactic satellite dis-
tribution highlighted in this work could aﬀect the estimate
of the total number of the MW satellites within its virial ra-
dius. For example, assuming the satellite density normaliza-
tion stipulated by the number of satellite detections within
the SDSS-DR10, in combination with the detection thresh-
old given by Eq. 18 and the radial distribution given by
Einasto proﬁle as described in Section 3.2.1, results in ∼200
satellites within 300 kpc (compared to ∼300 using the SDSS-
DR5 density normalization, see Figure 6). Thus the ratio
of the total number of dwarf satellites could be as high
as NLMC/NMW ∼ 1/3 while the host mass ratio is only
MLMC/MMW ∼ 1/10. This estimate comes with a large
uncertainty, and as such should be taken with great cau-
tion. If reliably established, the scaling of the number of
satellites with the host mass can oﬀer a glimpse into the
physics of dwarf evolution in group environments, where the
eﬀects of pre-processing have so far been largely neglected
and are currently poorly constrained (see Wetzel et al. 2015).
For example, it is speculated that the low gas temperature
and the remote Local Volume location of the group halo
could enhance the survival chances of the low-luminosity
dwarfs (e.g. D’Onghia & Lake 2008). Additionally, in Mag-
ellanic analogs - compared to the MW analogs with masses of

∼ 1012M(cid:12) - tidal stripping must be suppressed, as only the

very central parts of the host contain densities high enough
to start shredding the orbiting subhaloes. This can be con-
trasted with the recent detection of an extended and highly
substructured stellar halo around the MCs by Belokurov &
Koposov (2016), naively implying that ample stripping has
been taking place in the LMC.

Inspired by the results presented here, the prospects for
the future study are plenty. We envisage a wide imaging
campaign to pick up the remaining LMC dwarfs, comple-
mented by a comprehensive spectroscopic follow-up to con-
strain their orbital properties. In parallel, the eﬀects of the
(lack of) group pre-processing should be pinned down with
the help of high-resolution collisionless and hydrodynami-
cal simulations. Finally, the analysis described here should
be extended to the remainder of the Milky Way’s satellite
population.
