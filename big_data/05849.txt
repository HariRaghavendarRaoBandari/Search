ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LARGEST REAL

EIGENVALUE FOR THE REAL GINIBRE ENSEMBLE.

By Mihail Poplavskyi, Roger Tribe and Oleg Zaboronski

Let ?N ` λmax be the largest real eigenvalue of a random N ˆ N
matrix with independent Np0, 1q entries (the ‘real Ginibre matrix’).
We study the large deviations behaviour of the limiting N Ñ 8 dis-
tribution rλmax ă ts of the shifted maximal real eigenvalue λmax.
In particular, we prove that the right tail of this distribution is Gaus-
sian: for t ą 0,

rλmax ă ts “ 1 ´

This is a rigorous conﬁrmation of the corresponding result of [7]. We
also prove that the left tail is exponential: for t ă 0,

Our results have implications for interacting particle systems. The
edge scaling limit of the law of real eigenvalues for the real Gini-
bre ensemble is a rescaling of a ﬁxed time distribution of annihilat-
ing Brownian motions (ABM’s) with the step initial condition, see
[10]. Therefore, the tail behaviour of the distribution of Xpmaxq
- the
position of the rightmost annihilating particle at ﬁxed time s ą 0
- can be read oﬀ from the corresponding answers for λmax using
Xpmaxq

1. Introduction and the main result. The laws describing the dis-
tribution of eigenvalues of large self-adjoint random matrices near the spec-
tral edge exhibit a large degree of universality. One of the examples is the
celebrated family of Tracy-Widom distributions for the largest eigenvalue
Fβ, β “ 1, 2, 4, which has been originally discovered in the context of Gaus-
sian orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles [16], [17]. These distribu-
tions also describe the scaling limit of the distribution of the largest eigen-
value for non-Gaussian invariant ensembles [3], [4] as well as non-invariant
ensembles of random matrices with independent non-Gaussian entries [15].
Moreover, Fβ appears in the large number of statistical models not directly
related to random matrices, such as random permutations, growth mod-
els belonging KPZ universality class and related asymmetric exclusion pro-
cesses, see [1] for a recent review.

There is a growing body of evidence that edge statistics for eigenval-
ues of non-Hermitian random matrices give rise to new universality classes.
The speciﬁc example we have in mind is the behaviour of real eigenvalues
for the ensemble of random real matrices with independent normal entries
(the so-called real Ginibre ensemble [9]). The law of real eigenvalues in the
edge scaling limit is governed by a Pfaﬃan point process discovered inde-
pendently in [7] and [2]. The same Pfaﬃan point process describes the law
of instantaneously annihilating Brownian motions on the line started with
half-space initial conditions, see [10]. Therefore, the scaling limit of the law
of the largest real eigenvalue for the real Ginibre ensemble is the same as
the law of the rightmost annihilating particle at a ﬁxed time. In this paper
we will analyse the tails of this distribution and show that

where λmax is the position of the maximal eigenvalue measured from the
right edge of the spectrum for the real Ginibre ensemble or it is the position
of the rightmost particle measured in units of ?4t for annihilating Brownian
motions.

Another example is the symmetric exclusion process on Z with half-ﬁlled
initial condition (all sites to the left of zero are occupied at time 0, all sites
to the right of zero are empty). Let Rt be the position of the rightmost
particle at time t. It is shown in [11] that

pRt “ 0q tÑ8„ e´ ζp3{2q?π

which coincides with (1.1) if we identify distance |s| with the diﬀusive scale
?8t. To verify that this agreement is not accidental, we one must compare
pλmax ă sq and pRs2{8 “ 0q for all values of s, not just in the large-
|s| limit, but the very possibility that there is a relation between the real
Ginibre ensemble and the symmetric exclusion process is intriguing.
Let us stress that formula (1.1) is easy to guess given results on bulk
gap probabilities described in Forrester [8]. Building on the paper [5] on gap
probability for annihilating Brownian motion and using the relation between
the bulk statistics for the real Ginibre ensemble and annihilating Brownian
motions with the maximal entrance law initial conditions [18], the author
of [8] showed that the bulk scaling limit of the gap probability for the real
Ginibre ensemble is given by (1.1) if |s| is interpreted as the size of the gap.
As the width of the transition region near the edge of the spectrum is of
order one for the real Ginibre ensemble, it is only natural to guess that (1.1)
stays valid at the edge with edge eﬀects showing only as Op1q terms. The
aim of the current paper is to verify these heuristics rigorously.

The starting point of our investigation is the following Fredholm deter-

minant representation of rλmax ă αs due to Rider and Sinclair [14]1:

Theorem 1.1 (B. Rider and C. D. Sinclair, 2014).

The reader is referred to the original paper for precise deﬁnitions of the
quantities entering the theorem. We mention brieﬂy only that detpI ´ T χtq
should be understood as the Fredholm determinant of the operator T acting
on L2pt,8q and that T is the square of a Hilbert-Schmidt operator, which
implies that T is positive and trace class.
The apparently complicated expression for the factor Γt in the statement
of the Rider-Sinclair theorem is actually rather simple, and cancellations
occur that imply that Γt “ p1 ´ atq. Therefore

expression for pλmax ă αq. Here we present the corrected version. An interested reader
is referred to the appendix for a discussion of the errors and their correction.

In what follows we are going to use the modiﬁed version (1.5) of the

Rider-Sinclair result.

As it turns out, the asymptotic analysis of (1.5) can be greatly simpliﬁed
by assigning a probabilistic interpretation to all the factors. Let pBn, n ě 0q
be the discrete time non-simple random walk with Gaussian Np0, 1{2q in-
crements started at zero. Let

(1.6)

τt “ inf ną0t2n ´ 1 : B2n´1 ă tu,
τ0 “ inf ną0t2n : B2n ą 0u,
τ “ τ0 ^ τt.

$&
%

In words: τ0 is the smallest even time such that Bτ0 ą 0, τt is the smallest
odd time such that Bτt ă t; τ is the minimum of τ0 and τt. Also, let
(1.7)
be the inﬁmum of the random walk pBsqě0 taken over all odd times not
exceeding the exit time τ0. Then we have the following probabilistic restate-
ment of Theorem 1.1:

Iτ0 “ inftBs : s is odd, s ď τ0u

For t ă 0, the above statement provides a rigorous justiﬁcation of (1.1).
The right tail asymptotic (1.10) is actually well known [7] since the prob-
ability of ﬁnding an eigenvalue very far to the right of the spectral edge is
approximately equal to the level density. This part of Theorem 1.3 should be
considered as a test of the Rider-Sinclair answer complemented by careful
bounding of error terms.

As has been already mentioned, the edge scaling limit of the law of real
eigenvalues for the real Ginibre ensemble coincides up to a Brownian rescal-
ing with the law of annihilating Brownian motions on the real line started
with the step initial condition [10]. The step initial condition corresponds to
the maximal entrance law for x ă 0 and zero density of particles for x ą 0.
The maximal entrance law can be realised as the inﬁnite intensity limit of
the Poisson initial distribution of particles for x ă 0, see [10] for precise
deﬁnitions and details. Therefore, Theorem 1.3 yields a simple corollary:

Corollary 1.1. Consider the system of instantaneously annihilating
Brownian motions on the real line started with the step initial condition. Let
Xpmaxq
be the position of the rightmost particle at a ﬁxed time s ą 0. Then

The above result complements the recent study [12] of annihilating Brow-
nian motions near the edge of the distribution, where the average number
of particles in the positive half-line p0,8q has been calculated.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we will prove
Lemma 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. The asymptotic analysis of pλmax ă sq is
carried out in Section 3. All technical lemmas needed for the proof of our
main result are proved in Appendix A. In Appendix B we explain how to
ﬁx the minor errors we found in the original statement of the Rider-Sinclair
Theorem.

2. The proof of Lemma 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. Let us examine
the Γ-factor deﬁned in the statement of the Rider-Sinclair Theorem 1.1.
Throughout the paper we will use the following basic property of the integral
operator T :

some simple changes of variables designed to re-write in terms of the den-
sity of a segment of the Gaussian random walk introduced in Section 1.
The integrand in (2.4) can be identiﬁed with the density for the initial
segment of the walk of length 2m ` 2 pB1, B2, . . . , B2m`2q at the point

Lemma 1.1 and the pre-factor in formula (1.8) of Theorem 1.2 are veriﬁed.
To check the exponent in the right hand side of (1.8), we use Lemma 2.1 to
justify the application of the trace-log formula to the Fredholm determinant
appearing in the Ryder-Sinclair Theorem and the subsequent expansion of
the logarithm:

3.1. Asymptotic expansion for t ă 0: the proof of (1.11). A natural start-
ing point for our analysis is equation (1.9). Firstly, let us investigate the
coeﬃcient of the Optq term, Epδ0pBτ0qq. The event tBτ0 P d0u depends only
on the position of the random walk at even times. Averaging over positions
at odd times we ﬁnd that

rBτ0 P d0s “ r ˜Bt0 P d0s,

where p ˜Bsqsě0 is a Gaussian random walk with Np0, 1q-increments and t0 “

The last expression can be evaluated using the following remarkable combi-

By a Brownian motion analogue, it is clear that each of the terms on the

logarithms cancel. This cancellation follows from the following two results:

It follows from Lemma 3.2 that

Substituting this bound into (A.1) and optimising with respect to m we

random walk ˜Bk “řk

A.2. Lemma 3.1. Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be the Gaussian increments of a
m“1 Xm, k “ 1, 2, . . . , n, conditioned to have ˜Bn “ 0.

In total, there are n! associated random walks corresponding to all permuta-
tions of the increments. All these permutations are equiprobable. Let us say
that two random walks are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other
by a cyclic permutation of the increments. Each equivalence class contains
n random walks. Almost surely, precisely one representative in each of the
classes will stay negative at all times between 1 and n´ 1. To construct such
a random walk, let us pick an arbitrary representative

˜B “ pX1, X1 ` X2, . . . , X1 ` X2 ` . . . ` Xn´1, 0q

of the equivalence class. Let k be the point of global maximum of ˜B. Then
the following cyclic permutation of ˜B is a random walk which stays below
the origin:

pXk`1, Xk`1 ` Xk`2, . . . , Xk`1 ` Xk`2 ` . . . ` Xn ` X1 ` . . . ` Xk´1, 0q.
All other cyclic permutations of ˜B will have at least one point above the
origin.

We conclude that the fraction of random walks conditioned to ﬁnish at
zero which stay below the origin at all times between 1 and n ´ 1 is equal
to pn!{nq{n! “ 1{n. Therefore,

r ˜B1 ă 0, . . . , ˜Bn´1 ă 0| ˜Bn “ 0s “

A.3. Lemma 3.2. Set τ “ τ0 ^ τt. By Wald’s identity [6] (or the op-

tional stopping theorem for random walks):

(A.3)

EpBτq “ EpB0q “ 0.

Therefore,

Let

EpBτ 1τ0ąτtq ` EpBτ 1τ0ăτtq “ 0.

Lτ0 “ Bτ0 , Lτt “ t ´ Bτt

be the positive overlaps (or ‘ladder heights’) of the random walk at the exit
times τ0 and τt correspondingly. It follows from the Wald identity that

Ep1τ0ąτtq “

1

|t| pEpLτ0q ´ EppLτ0 ` Lτtq1τ0ąτtqq

Applying Spitzer’s theorem (see e. g. [6], Chapter XVIII.5) to the Gaus-

sian random walk, we ﬁnd that

EpBτ0q “

,

which implies that

rτ0 ą τts “ Ep1τ0ąτtq “

1

|t|ˆ 1

?2 ´ EppLτ0 ` Lτtq1τ0ąτtq˙

As the second term on the right hand side of the above formula is non-
negative, the upper bound on rτ0 ą τts claimed in Lemma 3.2 is proved.
To establish the lower bound, we apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to
bound EppLτ0 ` Lτtq1τ0ąτtq. Solving the resulting inequality with respect to
Ep1τ0ąτtq we ﬁnd that

Ep1τ0ąτtq ě

The upper bound of Lemma 3.2 will be proved with C “b2?2EpL2
τ0 ` L2
τtq
if we can show that the moments EpL2
τ0q and EpL2
τtq exist. The existence
of moments is an immediate consequence of the following observation: let
Ws „ Np0, sq. Then, for any positive function f on R,
EpfpW1q1W1ą0q ď tEpfpBτ0qq, EpfpBτtqqu ď 2 sup
sPp0,1q
(A.4)

EpfpWsq1Wsą0q.

The desired result follows from the ﬁniteness of the second moment of a
Gaussian distribution.

To prove the lower bound in (A.4), notice ﬁrst that

EpfpBτ0qq “ Epfp ˜Bt0qq,

Let pF W

APPENDIX B: A NOTE ON THE RIDER-SINCLAIR THEOREM.

For all the deﬁnitions, notations and numberings used in this appendix
we refer readers to the original paper [14]. Here we deal only with the case of
even sized matrices, therefore we ﬁx the problems happening in paragraph
4.1 of the paper.

Careful readers could mention that the diﬀerence between the original
statement and our presented one occurs only in the factor Γt. The origin of
this factor is a ﬁnite rank perturbation of the operator Tnχ (see [14, (4.9)]).
We state and ﬁx the following errors here:

(i) the limits of the functions ˜φn, ˜ψn (see [14, (4.15)]) were calculated
incorrectly, and this leads to new deﬁnitions for Gpxq and g pxq and some
changes to the constants contained in the third term of Γt expression as well;
(ii) it was noted in [14, p.1644, last paragraph] that ´ t
˜ψn pxq dx con-
´8
verges to Gptq which is true only up to an additive constant and yields
corrections to the fourth term of Γt expression.
˜ψn pxq.

We start with the right derivation of the limits lim

where P pa, xq “ Γpa,xq
is an incomplete regularized Gamma function. It is

easy to check by using the duplication formula for Gamma functions that
the pre factor in front of P is asymptotically equal to 2´1{2. For the last
factor we use the well known asymptotic formula (see, e.g. [2, (9.16)])

Remark B.1. We would also like to mention that after the corrections

made above that the product

erfcp´yq

becomes consistent with the second term of Sn px, yq scaled limit from [2].

Remark B.2.

In this appendix we continue to use deﬁnitions (B.1),
(B.2) instead of the ones used in Theorem 1.1 to underline the changes one
needs to perform for calculating the right scaling limit of the 2 ˆ 2 determi-
nant detp1 ´ pαi, βjqq1ďi,jď2 (see [14, p.1641-1644]). However, throughout
the paper we use the deﬁnitions for functions g, G stated at the beginning of
the paper. We have boxed the extra terms ‘lost’ in the original paper.

The ﬁrst matrix element pα1, β1q converges to

ˆ 8

t

GpxqpI ´ T χtq´1gpxqdx,

with operators T and χt deﬁned as in Theorem 1.1. The second term pα1, β2q
converges to

pI ´ T χtq´1Gptq ´ Gp8q “ pI ´ T χtq´1Gptq ´

1
?2

.

For the last two terms (see [14, (4.12)]) we ﬁrstly perform the simpliﬁcation
from the original paper by removing all the terms containing cn. Let us
use 0 subscript to denote the new values. Then following [14, p. 1644, last
paragraph] we write

pα2, β1q0 “
