Regularity of Villadsen algebras and characters on

their central sequence algebras

Martin S. Christensen∗

Abstract

We show that if A is a simple Villadsen algebra of either the ﬁrst
type with seed space a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex, or of the second
type, then A absorbs the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially if and only if the
central sequence algebra of A does not admit characters. Additionally,
modifying the construction of Villadsen algebras of the second type, we
provide the ﬁrst example of a unital, simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-
algebra with a unique tracial state which fails the Corona Factorization
Property.

Introduction

Villadsen algebras, introduced by Jesper Villadsen in [37] and [38] respec-
tively, fall into two types and both display properties not previously observed
for simple AH algebras. Together they form a class of unital, simple and
separable AH algebras exhibiting a wide range of exotic behaviour; arbitrary
stable and real rank, arbitrary radius of comparison, and perforation in their
ordered K0 groups and Cuntz semigroups.

The ﬁrst type of Villadsen algebras was introduced in [37] as the ﬁrst
examples of unital, simple AH algebras with perforation in their ordered K0
groups. In particular, they were the ﬁrst examples of simple AH algebras
without slow dimension growth. Modifying the construction, Toms exhibited
for each positive real number r > 0 a unital, simple AH algebra with rate of
growth r (in the sense that the radius of comparison is r). The techniques
introduced by Villadsen also played a crucial role in Rørdam’s construction
in [29] of a simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra in the UCT class con-
taining an inﬁnite and a non-zero ﬁnite projection, the ﬁrst counterexample
to the Elliott conjecture in its previous incarnation. In [34] Toms used a
modiﬁcation of the AH algebras in [37] to provide a particularly egregious
counterexample to the previous Elliott conjecture. Toms and Winter gave
a formal deﬁnition of Villadsen algebras of the ﬁrst type in [36], which in-
cludes Villadsen’s original constructions, and the subsequent modiﬁcations

of Toms in [34] and [35]. In the same paper they conﬁrmed what has later
been named the Toms–Winter conjecture for this class of C ∗-algebras, i.e.,
they show that for a simple Villadsen algebra of the ﬁrst type with seed
space a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex (see Deﬁnition 3.2), the regularity
properties: Jiang-Su stability, strict comparison of positive elements, and
ﬁnite decomposition rank are equivalent. The latter regularity property, or
even the (formally) weaker requirement of ﬁnite nuclear dimension, has since
been proven to suﬃce for classiﬁcation, under the additional assumption of
UCT (the complete proof of this has a long history and is the work of many
hands, but the ﬁnal steps were carried out in [14],[9] and [31]).

The second type of Villadsen algebras was introduced in [38] as the ﬁrst
examples of simple AH algebras with stable rank higher than one. In fact,
every possible value of the stable rank is achieved, i.e., for each 1 ≤ k ≤ ∞
a unital, simple AH algebra Vk is constructed such that sr(Vk) = k, and
the real rank satisﬁes k ≤ RR(Vk) ≤ k + 1. In addition, each C ∗-algebra
Vk has a unique tracial state and perforation in the ordered K0 group, in
particular Vk ⊗ Z 6∼= Vk. Ng and Kucerovsky showed in [19] that V2 has the
Corona Factorization Property, thus providing the ﬁrst example of a simple
C ∗-algebra satisfying this property while having perforation in the ordered
K0 group. The construction also formed the basis for Toms’ counterexample
to the previous Elliott conjecture in [32].

As indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the class of Villadsen alge-
bras form a rich class containing examples of both regular C ∗-algebras and
C ∗-algebras displaying a wide range of irregularity, while still remaining
amenable to analysis. As such, they form a good ’test class’ for statements
concerning simple and nuclear C ∗-algebras.

The central sequence algebra of a unital separable C ∗-algebra A (see Sec-
tion 2.1 for a deﬁnition), which we denote F (A), has featured prominently
in the study of regularity of C ∗-algebras as formalized in the Toms–Winter
conjecture (see for instance [21, 22],[6],[39]). The notation F (A) was intro-
duced by Kirchberg in [16], wherein the deﬁnition of F (A) was extended
to not necessarily unital C ∗-algebras in a meaningful way (for instance,
F (A) is unital whenever A is σ-unital and the assignment A 7→ F (A) is a
stable invariant). In analogy with the von Neumann central sequence alge-
bra of II1-factors, the central sequence algebra detects absorption of certain
well-behaved C ∗-algebras. More precisely, if B is a unital, separable C ∗-
algebra with approximately inner half-ﬂip (i.e., the two factor embeddings
B → B ⊗ B are approximately unitarily equivalent), then A ⊗ B ∼= A if
n=1 B, e.g., when B is
the Jiang-Su algebra Z, then A ⊗ B ∼= A if and only if such an embedding
exists. Signiﬁcant progress in our understanding of the central sequence al-
gebra of stably ﬁnite C ∗-algebras was obtained by Matui and Sato in [21, 22].
In these papers they introduced property (SI), a regularity property which
facilitates liftings of certain properties of a tracial variant of the central se-

there exists a unital embedding B → F (A). If B ∼=N∞

quence algebra to the central sequence algebra itself (see for instance [17,
Proposition 3.9]). Furthermore, they prove that whenever A is a unital, sim-
ple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra with strict comparison, then A has
property (SI) and as a consequence, if A has only ﬁnitely many extremal
tracial states, then Z embeds unitally in F (A) hence A ⊗ Z ∼= A. Prompted
by the analogy with von Neumann II1 factors one might hope that the Mc-
Duﬀ dichotomy (cf. [23]) carries over to C ∗-algebras. However, as proven by
Ando and Kirchberg in [1], the central sequence algebra F (A) is non-abelian
whenever A is separable and not type I. In addition, it can happen F (A)
is non-abelian and contains no simple, unital C ∗-algebra other than C (see
[16, Corollary 3.14]). Hence, non-commutativity of F (A) does not suﬃce to
conclude regularity. Addressing this issue, Kirchberg and Rørdam asked the
following question in [17].

Question 1.1. Let A be a unital and separable C ∗-algebra. Does it follows
that A ⊗ Z ∼= A if and only if F (A) has no characters?

Another question under consideration in the present paper is the follow-
ing: given a unital, simple C ∗-algebra A with a unique tracial state, when
can one conclude that A is regular? In certain situations, a unique tracial
state is suﬃcient to conclude regularity and even classiﬁability by the El-
liott invariant. For instance, Elliott and Niu showed in [10] that if X is a
compact metrizable Hausdorﬀ space and σ is a minimal homeomorphism of
X such that the dynamical system (X, σ) has mean dimension zero and is
uniquely ergodic, i.e., C(X) ⋊σ Z has a unique tracial state, then C(X) ⋊σ Z
is Z stable and classiﬁable (this is not automatic, cf. [13]). Similarly, as
proven by Niu (see [25, Theorem 1.1]) if A is a unital, simple AH algebra
with diagonal maps such that the set of extremal tracial states is countable,
then A is without dimension growth. In particular, any AH algebra of this
type with a unique tracial state has real rank zero (cf. [3]). On the other
hand, as demonstrated in [38], a unique tracial state does not suﬃce to con-
clude neither real rank zero nor Z stability for general AH algebras. It is
therefore natural to ask what (if any) regularity properties are implied by
the existence of a unique tracial state.

The Corona Factorization Property was introduced by Kucerovsky and
Ng in [18] and is related to both the theory of extensions and the question
of when extensions are automatically absorbing (see for instance [20]). It is
a very mild regularity condition, which nonetheless does exclude the most
exotic behaviour. For instance, if A is a separable C ∗-algebra satisfying
the Corona Factorization Property and Mn(A) is stable for some n ∈ N
then A must also be stable (see [26, Proposition 4.7]). Under the additional
assumption that A is simple and has real rank zero it also follows that A
is either stably ﬁnite or purely inﬁnite. Examples of C ∗-algebras failing
the Corona Factorization Property have been provided in the literature.

3

For instance, the C ∗-algebras constructed in [29] and [28] fail the Corona
Factorization Property

The main result of the present paper is that question 1.1 has an aﬃr-
mative answer when A is either a simple Villadsen algebra of the ﬁrst type
with seed space a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex or a Villadsen algebra of
the second type (see Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 4.4 respectively). We also
produce an example of a unital, simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra
with a unique tracial state which fails the Corona Factorization Property
(see section 4.1). While examples of unital, simple, separable and nuclear
C ∗-algebras without the Corona Factorization Property are already known,
as noted above, the example provided here is to the best of the author’s
knowledge the ﬁrst of its kind with a unique tracial state.
In particular,
it is a strong counterexample to the speculation that a unique tracial state
should imply regularity.

2 Background

2.1 The Central Sequence Algebra

Let A be a unital C ∗-algebra, ω be a free ultraﬁlter on N and ℓ∞(A) denote
the sequences (an)n ⊆ A such that supn kank < ∞. The ultrapower Aω of
A with respect to ω is deﬁned by

Aω := ℓ∞(A)/{(an)n ∈ ℓ∞(A) | lim
n→ω

kank = 0}.

Given a sequence (an)n ∈ ℓ∞(A) let [(an)n] ∈ Aω denote the image un-
der the quotient map. There is a natural embedding ι : A → Aω given by
ι(a) = [(a, a, a, . . . )]. Since ι is injective it is often suppressed and A is
considered to be a subalgebra of Aω, a convention we shall follow here. The
central sequence algebra F (A) of A is deﬁned by F (A) := Aω ∩ A′. The no-
tation F (A) was introduced by Kirchberg in [16], wherein the deﬁnition of
the central sequence algebra was extended to (possibly non-unital) σ-unital
C ∗-algebras in a meaningful way. We retain this notation, although only
unital C ∗-algebras are considered here, to emphasize the connection with
Kirchberg’s work. Furthermore, the ultraﬁlter is suppressed in the notation,
since the isomorphism class of (unital) separable sub-C ∗-algebras B ⊆ F (A)
is independent of the choice of free ultraﬁlter. More precisely, if B is a
separable C ∗-algebra and there exists a (unital) injective ∗-homomorphism
B → Aω ∩ A′ for some free ultraﬁlter ω on N, then there exists a (unital)
injective ∗-homomorphism B → Aω′ ∩ A′ for any free ultraﬁlter ω′ on N. In
particular, the question of whether F (A) has characters is independent of the
choice of free ultraﬁlter (see [17, Lemma 3.5]). Whether Aω ∩ A′ ∼= Aω′ ∩ A′
for arbitrary free ultraﬁlters ω and ω′ on N depends on the Continuum
Hypothesis (see [12] and [11, Theorem 5.1]).

4

As described in [17], building on results from [27], there is a useful rela-
tionship between divisibility properties of F (A) and comparability properties
of Cu(A). We rely on an elaboration of this technique to obtain our results.

2.2 Vector Bundles and Characteristic Classes

In order to access the machinery of characteristic classes within the frame-
work of C ∗-algebras we need the following observation: Let K denote the
compact operators acting on a separable, inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space
H, let p ∈ C(X) ⊗ K be a projection and let ξp denote vector bundle over
X given by

ξp := {(x, v) ∈ X × H | v ∈ p(x)}.

It is a consequence of Swan’s Theorem that the assignment p 7→ ξp induces
a one-to-one correspondence of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of
projections in C(X) ⊗ K with isomorphism classes of vector bundles over X,
in such a way that q - p if and only if there exists a vector bundle η over
X such that ξq ⊕ η ∼= ξp. We shall be concerned with the ordering of vector
bundles according to the above described pre-order. For this purpose we
employ the machinery of characteristic classes of vector bundles described
below, a technique pioneered by Jesper Villadsen in [37] and [38].

Given a compact Hausdorﬀ space X and vector bundle ω of (complex)

ﬁbre dimension k, the Chern character c(ω) ∈ H ∗(X) is

c(ω) = 1 +

ci(ω),

∞

Xi=1

where cj(ω) ∈ H 2j(X) is the j’th Chern class for each 1 ≤ j ≤ k, and
cj(ω) = 0 whenever j > k. Furthermore, the top Chern class ck(ω) is the
Euler class e(ω) of ω. The Chern character has the following properties:

(i) If θk denotes the trivial vector bundle of ﬁbre dimension k ∈ N, then

c(θk) = 1 ∈ H 0(X) for any k ∈ N.

(ii) For arbitrary vector bundles ω, η over X we have c(ω ⊕ η) = c(ω)c(η),
where the product is the cup product in the cohomology ring H ∗(X).

(iii) If Y is another compact Hausdorﬀ space and f : Y → X is continuous

then c(f ∗(ω)) = f ∗(c(ω)).

Properties (ii) and (iii) above also holds for the Euler class, while the ﬁrst
property instead becomes e(θk) = 0 for all k ∈ N. This can be deduced from
the above description of the Chern character.

In the following sections it will suﬃce to ﬁnd a reasonably good method
for determining which Chern classes of a vector bundle are non-zero. Such
a method is provided by the following observation: Given any ﬁnite number

5

of ﬁnite CW-complexes X1, . . . , Xn such that H i(Xj) is a free Z-module for
each i and j, it follows from the K¨unneth formula (see [24, Theorem A.6])
that the map

H i1(X1) ⊗ H i2(X2) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H in(Xn) → H i(X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn),

where i =Pn

k=1 ik, given by

a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an 7→ ρ∗

1(a1)ρ∗

2(a2) · · · ρ∗

n(an),

is injective. A particular application of this observation is the following: for
each i = 1, . . . , n let ξi be a vector bundle over Xi such that e(ξi) ∈ H ∗(Xi) is
non-zero for i = 1, . . . , n. Since each H i(Xj) is without torsion, the element
e(ξ1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ e(ξn) is also non-zero, whence

1(ξ1) ⊕ ρ∗

2(ξ2) ⊕ · · · ⊕ ρ∗

1(e(ξ1))ρ∗

2(e(ξ2) · · · ρ∗

n(e(ξn)) 6= 0.

e(cid:0)ρ∗

n(ξn)(cid:1) = ρ∗

We will apply this observation only to the situation where X and Y are
either (S2)k for some k or a complex projective space CP k, in which case
the hypothesis are satisﬁed.

2.3 The Cuntz Semigroup, Comparison and Divisibility

We give a quick introduction to the Cuntz semigroup as deﬁned in [8]. We
restrict our attention to the properties needed in the current exposition, and
interested readers should consult [8] or [2] for a fuller exposition.

Let A be a C ∗-algebra and let a, b ∈ A+. We say that a is Cuntz
dominated by b, and write a - b, if there exists a sequence (xn)n ⊆ A
such that ka − x∗
nbxnk → 0. We say that a is Cuntz equivalent to b, and
write a ∼ b, if a - b and b - a. Let K denote the compact operators on a
separable, inﬁnite dimension Hilbert space and deﬁne

Cu(A) := (A ⊗ K)+/ ∼ .

We write hai for the equivalence class of an element a ∈ (A ⊗ K)+. Then
Cu(A) becomes an ordered abelian semgroup when equipped with the op-
eration

hai + hbi := ha ⊕ bi,

a, b ∈ (A ⊗ K)+

and order deﬁned by hai ≤ hbi if and only if a - b. Additionally, any
upwards directed countable set S ⊆ Cu(A) admits a supremum. Given
x, y ∈ Cu(A) we say that x is compactly contained in y, and write x ≪ y,
if for any increasing sequence (yk)k ⊆ Cu(A) with supk yk = y there exists
k0 ∈ N such that x ≤ yk0. Equivalently, if a, b ∈ (A ⊗ K)+ then hai ≪ hbi if
and only if there exists ε > 0 such that a - (b − ε)+. An element x ∈ Cu(A)
satisfying x ≪ x is said to be compact. Note that hpi is compact whenever
p ∈ (A ⊗ K)+ is a projection.

The following proposition is a strengthening of [17, Theorem 4.9] with
essentially the same proof. Although the strengthening is minor, it is crucial
to Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 4.4.

Proposition 2.1. Let A be a unital, separable C ∗-algebra. If F (A) has no
characters, then for each m ∈ N there exists n ∈ N such that the following
holds: given x, y1, . . . , yn ∈ Cu(A) such that x ≤ myi for all i = 1, . . . , n,
then

x ≤

yi.

n

Xi=1

Proof. It follows from [17, Lemma 3.5] that there exists a unital, separable
sub-C ∗-algebra B ⊆ F (A) such that B has no characters. Hence, [27, Corol-
lary 5.6 (i) and Lemma 6.2] impliy that for each m ∈ N there exists n ∈ N

such that the inﬁnite maximal tensor product C ∗-algebra D := Nk∈N B is
fying myi ≤ h1Di, for all i = 1, . . . , n, and h1Di ≤Pn

weakly (m, n)-divisible, i.e., there exist elements y1, . . . , yn ∈ Cu(D) satis-
j=1 yj. Note that since
B ⊆ F (A) is unital and separable, it follows from [16, Corollary 1.13] that
there exists a unital ∗-homomorphism ϕ : D → F (A). Let P ⊆ Aω denote
the image under the natural map A ⊗max D → Aω. By [17, Lemma 4.1]
the induced map Cu(A) → Cu(P ) is an order embedding, and therefore the
result ﬁnally follows from [27, Lemma 6.1].

3 Villadsen Algebras of the ﬁrst type

In this section we study Villadsen algebras of the ﬁrst type, as deﬁned by
Toms and Winter in [36] based on the construction by Villadsen in [37]. We
prove that for a simple Villadsen algebra A of the ﬁrst type with seed space
a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex, F (A) has no characters if and only if A
has strict comparison of positive elements (Theorem 3.5). We also note in
passing that if A is not an AF algebras, then A has real rank zero if and
only if it has a unique tracial state (Proposition 3.6).

For the readers convenience we recall the deﬁnition of a Villadsen algebra

of the ﬁrst type (see also [36]).

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let X, Y be a compact Hausdorﬀ spaces and n, m ∈ N be
given such that n | m. A ∗-homomorphism ϕ : Mn ⊗ C(X) → Mm ⊗ C(Y )
is said to be diagonal if it has the form

f ◦ λ1

f 7→


0
...
0

0

· · ·

f ◦ λ2

· · ·

. . .
0

0
...
0

f ◦ λm/n

,




7

where each λi : Y → X is a continuous map for i = 1, . . . , m/n. The maps
λ1, . . . , λm/n are called the eigenvalue maps of ϕ.

The map ϕ above is said be a Villadsen map of the ﬁrst type (a
VI-map) if Y = X ×k for some k ∈ N and each eigenvalue map is either a
coordinate projection or constant.

Note that, in contrast with the construction in [37], given a VI map
ϕ : C(X) ⊗ Mn → C(X ×k) ⊗ Mm as above, it is not necessary that the
coordinate projections that occur as eigenvalue maps for ϕ are distinct, nor
that every possible coordinate projection X ×k → X occurs as an eigenvalue
map for ϕ.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀ space and let (ni)i∈N and
(mi)i∈N be sequences of natural numbers with n1 = 1 and such that mi|mi+1
and ni|ni+1 for all i ∈ N. Put Xi = X ×ni. A unital C ∗-algebra A is said
to be a Villadsen algebra of the ﬁrst type (a VI algebra) if it can be
written as an inductive limit

A ∼= lim−→(Mmi ⊗ C(Xi), ϕi),

where each ϕi is a VI map. We refer to the above inductive system as a
standard decomposition for A with seed space X.

Although not required in the above deﬁnition, we shall only consider sim-
ple VI algebras in the present paper. Additionally, we require that the seed
space is a ﬁnite dimensional CW complex. This is a particularly tractable
class of C ∗-algebras, as demonstrated by the following theorem due to Toms
and Winter.

Theorem 3.3 (See [36]). Let A be a simple VI algebra admitting a stan-
dard decomposition with seed space a ﬁnite-dimensional CW complex. The
following are equivalent:

(i) A has ﬁnite decomposition rank.

(ii) A is Z-stable.

(iii) A has strict comparison of positive elements.

(iv) A has slow dimension growth as an AH algebra.

It follows directly from Deﬁnition 3.2 that whenever X is a zero dimen-
sional CW complex, i.e., is a ﬁnite discrete space, the corresponding VI al-
gebra is a unital AF algebra. In the interest of the ﬂuency of this exposition
we shall henceforth assume that dim(X) > 0, since the case dim(X) = 0
often requires separate consideration, and unital, simple AF algebras are
already well-understood. We proceed to introduce some notation.

8

i

For each j ≥ i let π(s)

i,j denote the s’th coordinate projection Xj =
X ×(nj /ni)
→ Xi. Following standard notation, we set ϕi,j := ϕj−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ϕi,
when j > i, set ϕi,i to be the identity map on Mmi ⊗ C(Xi), and ϕi,j to
be the zero map when j < i. It is easy to check that ϕi,j : Mmi ⊗ C(Xi) →
Mmj ⊗ C(Xj) is a VI map whenever j > i. For each j > i let Ei,j denote the
set of eigenvalue maps of ϕi,j, and for each λ ∈ Ei,j let mult(λ) denote the
multiplicity of λ, i.e., the number of times λ occurs as an eigenvalue map of
ϕi,j. Furthermore, let

E(1)
E(2)

i,j := {λ ∈ Ei,j | λ is a coordinate projection},

i,j := {λ ∈ Ei,j | λ is constant}.

We will refer to the eigenvalue maps λ ∈ E(2)
i,j as point evaluations. For each
i < j write ϕi,j = ψi,j ⊕ χi,j, where ψi,j is the diagonal ∗-homomorphism
corresponding to the eigenvalue maps of ϕi,j, which are contained in E(1)
i,j ,
and χi,j is the diagonal ∗-homomorphism corresponding to the eigenvalue
maps of ϕi,j, which are contained in E(2)
i,j . Finally, we deﬁne the following
numbers

N (i, j) := |E(1)

i,j |, α(i, j) := Xλ∈E(1)

i,j

mult(λ), M (i, j) := Xλ∈Ei,j

mult(λ).

In other words, M (i, j) denotes the multiplicity (number of eigenvalue maps)
of ϕi,j, α(i, j) denotes the number of coordinate projections occurring in
ϕi,j while N (i, j) denotes the number of diﬀerent coordinate projections
occurring in ϕi,j. Note that when j > i we have

M (i, j) = M (i, j − 1)M (j − 1, j), N (i, j) = N (i, j − 1)N (j − 1, j),

α(i, j) = α(i, j − 1)α(j − 1, j),

and that 0 ≤ N (i,j)

M (i,j) ≤ α(i,j)

M (i,j) ≤ 1. In particular, the sequences

M (i, j)(cid:19)j>i
(cid:18) N (i, j)

and (cid:18) α(i, j)

M (i, j)(cid:19)j>i

are decreasing and convergent. Furthermore, setting ci = limj→∞

N (i,j)
M (i,j)
α(i,j)
M (i,j) , the sequences (ci)i and (di)i are both increasing
and di = limj→∞
and ci ≤ di for all i ∈ N. In fact, it is easy to check that either ci = 0 for
all i ∈ N or limi→∞ ci = 1. Similarly, either di = 0 for all i or limi→∞ di = 1
(see the proof of [36, Lemma 5.1]).

During the proof of Theorem 3.5 we need the following Chern charac-
ter obstruction, essentially due to Villadsen, and later reﬁned by Toms in
[34],[35] and Toms–Winter in [36]. The proof is implicitly contained in the
proof of [36, Lemma 4.1].

Lemma 3.4. Let A be a Villadsen algebra which admits a standard de-
composition (Ai, ϕi) with seed space a ﬁnite-dimensional CW -complex X
of non-zero dimension. Assume furthermore that for some i ∈ N there
exist a positive element a ∈ C(Xi) ⊗ Mmi , k ∈ N, and a closed subset
Xi ⊇ K ∼= (S2)k such that a|K is Cuntz equivalent to a vector bundle ξ of
(complex) ﬁbre dimension n with non-zero top Chern class cn(ξ). For each
j > i deﬁne a closed subset Ki,j ⊆ Xj by
Ki,j := ×nj/ni

where

and xj ∈ Xi. Let ξj denote the vector bundle over Ki,j corresponding to
ψi,j(a)|Ki,j . Then the nN (i, j)’th Chern class cnN (i,j)(ξj) is non-zero.
Proof. Note that Ki,j ∼= K ×N (i,j) ∼= (S2)×kN (i,j). Since a|K is (equivalent
to) a projection, it follows from the deﬁnition of ψi,j, that ψi,j(a)|Ki,j
is
(equivalent to) a projection. As in the statement above, let ξ denote the
vector bundle corresponding to a|K and ξj the vector bundle corresponding
to ψi,j(a)|Ki,j . We easily deduce that

ξj ∼= Mλ∈E(1)

SinceQN (i,j)

The following theorem is the main result of this section. The proof is
quite similar to the proof of [36, Lemma 4.1]. However, since the statement
of the following theorem is diﬀerent, the proof needs to be modiﬁed, and in
the interest of clarity of the exposition, we include a full proof.

Theorem 3.5. Let A be a simple Villadsen algebra of the ﬁrst type which
admits a standard decomposition (Ai, ϕi) with seed space a ﬁnite-dimensional
CW -complex. Then A has strict comparison (and hence A ⊗ Z ∼= A) if and
only if F (A) has no characters.

Proof. Assume A has strict comparison. Then it follows from Theorem 3.3
that A ⊗ Z ∼= A, whence there exists a unital embedding Z → F (A). Since
Z has no characters it follows that F (A) does not admit a character either.
We show, using Proposition 2.1, that F (A) has at least one character if A
does not have strict comparison.

Fix n ≥ 2. Since A does not have strict comparison it follows from [36,

Lemma 5.1] that

Note that since dim(X) > 0 and A is simple, the number of point evaluations
occurring as eigenvalue maps in ϕi,j is unbounded as j → ∞ for any i ∈ N.
In particular, M (i, j) → ∞ as j → ∞, whence (1) implies dim(Xi) → ∞ as
i → ∞. Hence, we may choose i ∈ N such that dim(Xi) ≥ 3n and

Choose an open subset O ⊆ Xi such that O ∼= (−1, 1)dim(Xi) =: D. Let

Y := {x ∈ (−1, 1)3 | dist(cid:0)x, (0, 0, 0)(cid:1) = 1/2}

11

and

Z := {x ∈ (−1, 1)3 | 1/3 ≤ dist(cid:0)x, (0, 0, 0)(cid:1) ≤ 2/3}.

Let Z0 denote the interior of Z and note that K ⊆ Z0. We identify K and
Z with their homeomorphic images in Xi and note that K ∼= (S2)n. For
each l = 1, . . . , n, let ρl : (S2)n → S2 denote the l’th coordinate projection.
Choose some line bundle ζ over S2 with non-zero Euler characteristic e(ζ) ∈
H 2(S2) (for instance the Hopf bundle), and set ξl := ρ∗
l (ζ). We consider
each ξl to be a vector bundle over K. Furthermore, let θ2 denote the trivial
vector bundle of ﬁbre dimension 2 over K. It follows from [15, Proposition
l=1 ξl, since
the Euler class of the right hand vector bundle is non-zero. We aim to
construct positive elements in A such that the above relationships between
vector bundles persist in Cu(A).

the projection corresponding to P ∗(θ2). Deﬁne elements bl, a ∈ Ai, for
l = 1, . . . , n, by bl := f · pl and a := f · p′. Since f ∈ Ai is central, and
p′ - pl ⊕ pl ⊕ pl for each l = 1, . . . , n, it easily follows that a - bl ⊕ bl ⊕ bl,
for each l = 1, . . . , n. Let

x := hϕi,∞(a)i ∈ Cu(A),

yl := hϕi,∞(bl)i ∈ Cu(A), for l = 1, . . . , n.

Clearly x ≤ 3yl for l = 1, . . . , n. To ﬁnish the proof we need to show
x 6≤ y1 + y2 + · · · + yn, and then Proposition 2.1 (with m = 3) will yield the
desired result.

Letting a be given as above and b = Ln

show that ϕi,∞(a) 6- ϕi,∞(b) in A ⊗ K. It suﬃces to prove that

projection in Ai such that χi,j(b)q = χi,j(b). Setting Q := ψi,j(1)⊕χi,j(b)1/2,
we have

ϕi,j(b) = ψi,j(b) ⊕ χi,j(b) = Q(ψi,j(b) ⊕ q)Q.

(3)

Now, let j > i be given and suppose for a contradiction, that there exists
v ∈ Aj ⊗ K such that kv∗ϕi,j(b)v − ϕi,j(a)k < 1/2. Then, setting w :=

This estimate remains valid upon restriction to any closed subset of Xj.

Let K ⊆ Xi and Ki,j ⊆ Xj be given as in the statement of Lemma
3.4, let ξ denote the vector bundle over K corresponding to b|K , and let ξj
denote the vector bundle over Ki,j corresponding to ψi,j(b)|Ki,j . Note that,

which is non-zero by the K¨unneth formula. It is easily deduced that q|Ki,j
corresponds to the trivial vector bundle θnr, where 0 ≤ r ≤ M (i, j) − α(i, j),
and since a|K ∈ C(K, K) is a constant projection valued function of rank 2
it follows that ψi,j(a)|Ki,j corresponds to the trivial vector bundle θ2α(i,j).
It therefore follows from (4) and [34, Lemma 2.1] that there exists a vector
bundle η of ﬁbre dimension (n − 2)α(i, j) + nr and t ∈ N such that

η ⊕ θ2α(i,j)+t

∼= ξj ⊕ θnr+t.

Applying the Chern character to both sides of the above expression, we ob-
tain that c(η) = c(ξj). In particular, cnN (i,j)(η) = cnN (i,j)(ξj), and therefore
Lemma 3.4 implies that cnN (i,j)(η) is non-zero. Hence rank(η) ≥ nN (i, j),
which implies

nN (i, j) ≤ (n − 2)α(i, j) + nr

≤ (n − 2)α(i, j) + n(M (i, j) − α(i, j))

Before considering Villadsen algebras of the second type let us record the
following proposition, which is an aggregation of results by other authors.
However, it does serve to illustrate the added complexity of Villadsen alge-
bras of the second type (compare with Theorem 4.2), which are less studied
than those of the ﬁrst type.

Proposition 3.6. Suppose A is a simple Villadsen algebra which admits a
standard decomposition with seed space a ﬁnite dimensional CW -complex of
non-zero dimension. Then A has real rank zero if and only if A has a unique
tracial state. Furthermore, in this case, A ⊗ Z ∼= A.

Proof. The proof that real rank zero implies unique tracial state is essen-
tially contained in [36, Proposition 7.1]. Indeed, replacing every instance of
N (i, j) in the cited proof with α(i, j), it follows that if RR(A) = 0, then
α(i,j)
M (i,j) = 0 for all i ∈ N. It is easy to check that this implies that A
limj→∞
has a unique tracial state. Furthermore, the statement that A is Z stable
follows from [36, Proposition 7.1] and a series of results summarized in [36,
Theorem 3.4].

On the other hand, assuming A has a unique tracial state, it follows from
[25, Theorem 1.1] that A has slow dimension growth. There is a simpler
proof for VI algebras, which we choose to omit to keep the exposition at a
reasonable length. Therefore, [3, Theorem 2] implies that A has real rank
zero.

4 Villadsen Algebras of the second type

In this section we study the Villadsen algebras of the second type. We prove
that for each Villadsen algebra A of the second type, F (A) has at least one
character (see corollary 4.4) and that the Villadsen algebra V∞ with inﬁnite
stable rank also fails the ω-comparison property (see Proposition 4.6). In
Section 4.1 we modify the construction to obtain an example of a unital,
simple, separable, nuclear C ∗-algebra with a unique tracial state which fails
the corona factorization property. For the convenience of the reader we
recall the construction from [38].

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let X, Y be compact Hausdorﬀ spaces. A ∗-homomorphism
ϕ : C(X) ⊗ K → C(Y ) ⊗ K is said to be a diagonal map of the second
type if there exists k ∈ N, continuous maps λ1, . . . , λk : Y → X, and mutu-
ally orthogonal projections p1, . . . , pk ∈ C(Y ) ⊗ K such that

ϕ = (idC(Y ) ⊗ α) ◦ ( ˜ϕ ⊗ idK),

where α : K ⊗ K → K is some isomorphism and ˜ϕ : C(X) → C(Y ) ⊗ K is
given by

˜ϕ(f ) =

(f ◦ λi)pi.

i=1, and the maps λi,

Note that in the above deﬁnition we have implicitly used that the C ∗-
algebra C(X) ⊗ K has a natural C(X)-module structure. Since all diagonal
maps appearing from this point on will be of the second type deﬁned above,
we simply refer to them as diagonal maps.

For each l ∈ N let CP l denote the l’th complex projective space, let γl
denote the universal line bundle over CP l, and let Dl denote the unit disc in
Cl. For each integer n ≥ 1, let σ(n) := n(n!) and σ(0) := 1. Furthermore,
let N∞ = N ∪ {∞} and let κ : N∞ × N → N be given by

Proof. We ﬁx an arbitrary k ∈ N∞, and omit k from our notation. For
each n ∈ N, and i = 1, . . . , n let q(n)
∈ An ⊗ K denote the projection
corresponding to the vector bundle ηn,i := π1∗
n,i(κ(k, i)ζi) over Xn, where ζi
is as deﬁned above, and rn ∈ An ⊗ K denote the projection corresponding
to the trivial line bundle θ1. Let q(n)

prove that the projections en, q(n)

(i): It is clear from the expression (6) that θ1 . ξn, where ξn is the vector
bundle corresponding to the unit pn ∈ An. Hence en . 1Vk = ϕn,∞(pn).
For the second statement, recall that ζi = π2∗
i (γκ(k,i)), where γl denotes the
universal line bundle over CP l. Hence it suﬃces to prove that 2κ(k, i)γκ(k,i)
dominates a trivial line bundle, for each i ∈ N. However, this follows from
straightforward dimension considerations. Indeed, since

2rank(2κ(k, i)γκ(k,i)) + 1 = 4κ(k, i) + 1

≥ 2κ(k, i) = dim(CP κ(k,i)),

the desired result follows (see for instance [15, Proposition 9.1.1]).

(ii): First, we introduce some notation. For each l ∈ N and j = 1, . . . , l,
j : Xl → CP κ(k,j) denote the coordinate projection, and note that

let ρl

But since the Euler characteristic of the right hand side is non-zero, this is
a contradiction.

the unit pn ∈ An. Since each q(n)

Corollary 4.4. For each k ∈ N, the central sequence algebra F (Vk) has at
least one character.

Proof. This is a straightforward consequence of Proposition 4.3 parts (i) and
(ii) and Proposition 2.1 (with m = 2).

Remark 4.5. It was proven in [17] that if A is a unital C ∗-algebra with
T (A) 6= ∅ and property (SI), then F (A) has a character if and only if
F (A)/(F (A) ∩ J(A)) has a character (see [17] for a deﬁnition of J(A)).
It follows from the above corollary that this is no longer true, if the assump-
tion of property (SI) is removed. Indeed, let k ∈ N∞ be arbitrary and Nk
denote the weak closure of πτ (Vk) ⊆ B(Hτ ), where πτ denotes the GNS rep-
resentation of Vk with respect to the tracial state τ . Since Vk has a unique
tracial state, it is a straightforward consequence of [30, Lemma 2.1] that

F (A)/(F (A) ∩ J(A)) ∼= N ω

k ∩ N ′.

Here N ω
k denotes the von Neumann ultrapower of N with respect to
the unique tracial state. Since Nk is injective,
it follows from Connes’
classiﬁcation of injective factors (cf. [7]) that N ∼= R, where R denotes
the hyperﬁnite II1 factor.
In particular, there exists a unital embedding
R → F (A)/(F (A) ∩ J(A)) and therefore F (A)/(F (A) ∩ J(A)) does not have
any characters. Hence, the above corollary shows that the assumption of
property (SI) in [17, Proposition 3.19] is indeed necessary.

18

The signiﬁcance of Proposition 4.3 (iii) may not be apparent, but it al-
lows us to compute the radius of comparison for each Vk. The radius of
comparison was originally deﬁned by Toms in [33], but an extended deﬁ-
nition was given in [5] and shown to agree with the original deﬁnition for
all suﬃciently ﬁnite C ∗-algebras, e.g., unital, simple and stably ﬁnite C ∗-
algebras. It follows from results of Toms (speciﬁcally [35, Corollary 5.2] and
[5, Proposition 3.2.4]), that rc(Vk) ≤ k for all k ∈ N∞, while the above
proposition shows that rc(Vk) ≥ k. However, when k = ∞ we can actually
do a little better.

Recall the following deﬁnition from [5]; let D be a σ-unital C ∗-algebra,
let e ∈ D ⊗ K be a strictly positive element and ∞ := hei ∈ Cu(D). Note
that since e ∈ D ⊗ K is strictly positive x - e for all x ∈ D ⊗ K. We say that
D has has ﬁnite radius of comparison with respect to ∞, if Cu(D) ∋ y = ∞
whenever λ(y) = ∞ for all non-zero functionals λ on Cu(D). A functional λ
on Cu(D) is a map λ : Cu(D) → [0, ∞] that is additive, preserves supremum
of increasing sequences and λ(0) = 0. This is a particular instance of a more
general deﬁnition (see [5, Deﬁnition 3.3.2]), but will suﬃce for our purposes.
Furthermore, recall the following deﬁnitions from [26]. Given a C ∗-algebra
A and elements x, y ∈ Cu(A), say that y stably dominates x, and write
x <s y, if there exists k ∈ N such that (k + 1)x ≤ ky. Then Cu(A) has the
ω-comparison property if, whenever x ∈ Cu(A) and (yn)n ⊆ Cu(A) satisﬁes
i=1 yi. It follows from [5, Theorem 4.2.1,
Corollary 4.2.5] that a unital, simple and stably ﬁnite C ∗-algebra D satisﬁes
the ω-comparison property if and only if D has ﬁnite radius of comparison
with respect to ∞.

x ≤ yk, for all k ∈ N, then x ≤P∞

Proposition 4.6. The radius of comparison of V∞ with respect to ∞ is not
ﬁnite. Hence, V∞ fails the ω-comparison property.

Proof. For each n ∈ N, let

Cu(V∞) ∋ xn := hq(n)

1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ q(n)
n i,

i

where each q(n)
is given as in the statement of Proposition 4.3, and u :=
h1V∞i ∈ Cu(V∞). It follows from the proof of Proposition 4.3 part (ii) that
the sequence (xn)∞
n=1 is increasing. Therefore we may set x := supn xn.
Since V∞ is unital, simple and nuclear it follows from [4, Theorem II.2.2]
and Proposition 4.3 part (iii) that

λ(x) = sup

n

λ(xn) = ∞,

for every non-zero functional λ on Cu(V∞). Assume, for a contradiction,
that x = ∞. In particular, u ≤ x and, since u is compact, this implies that
u ≤ xm for some m ∈ N. However, it follows from Proposition 4.3 parts (i)
and (ii) that em ≤ u and em 6≤ xm, and therefore u 6≤ xm.

19

Unfortunately the above proposition does not imply that V∞ fails the
Corona Factorization Property (although this might be true). The con-
struction of a Villadsen algebra of the second type which fails the Corona
Factorization Property is the goal of the next section.

4.1 A C ∗-algebra without the Corona Factorization Property

In this section we construct an example of a unital, simple, separable and
nuclear C ∗-algebra with a unique tracial state which fails the Corona Fac-
torization Property, using a variation on the above construction. While
examples of (simple) C ∗-algebras without the Corona Factorization Prop-
erty are well-known (for instance, the C ∗-algebras constructed in [29, 28]
must fail the Corona Factorization Property), there are, to our knowledge,
no such examples that also have a unique tracial state. The construction
follows the same recipe as the Villadsen algebras of the preceding paragraph,
but we increase the dimension growth to obtain the result.

Deﬁne, inductively, a sequence of numbers (κ(k))k≥0 by κ(0) = 1 and

κ(k) = 2(k + 1)

κ(l),

k ≥ 1.

k−1

Xl=0

For each integer n ≥ 0, set

Xn = CP κ(0) × CP κ(1) × · · · × CP κ(n).

Note that Xn = Xn−1 × CP κ(n) for all n ∈ N and let

π1
n : Xn → Xn−1

and π2

n : Xn → CP κ(n)

denote the coordinate projections. For each l ∈ N, let γl denote the universal
line bundle over CP l, and let ζn denote the induced vector bundle π2∗
n (γκ(n))
over Xn. Furthermore, let ˜ϕn : C(Xn) ⊗ K → C(Xn+1) ⊗ K denote the
diagonal map arising from the tuple (πn+1, θ) ∪ (yn,j, ζn+1)n+1
j=1 , where the
points {yn,j} ⊆ Xn are chosen so that the resulting C ∗-algebra is simple.

Finally, let p0 ∈ C(X0) ⊗ K denote the projection corresponding to the
trivial line bundle over X0, let pn = ˜ϕ0,n(p0), and An := pn(C(Xn) ⊗ K)pn,
and let ϕn denote the restriction of ˜ϕn to An. Deﬁne A to be the inductive
limit of the system {(An, ϕn)}n≥1. As in the last section, if η is a vector
bundle over Xn then

n(η) ∼= π1∗
ϕ∗

n (η) ⊕ (n + 1)rank(η)ζn+1.

(7)

Let ξn denote the vector bundle over Xn corresponding to the unit pn ∈ An.
Then

ξn ∼= θ × σ(1)γκ(1) × · · · × σ(n)γκ(n).

In particular, rank(ξn) = (n + 1)!.

By construction, A is a unital, simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra
and, by arguments very similar to those of [38], it follows that A has a unique
tracial state. We proceed to prove that Cu(A) does not have the Corona
Factorization Property for semigroups which in turn, by [26, Theorem 5.13],
is equivalent to A not having the (strong) Corona Factorization Property.

Theorem 4.7. Let A be the C ∗-algebra constructed above. Then A is a
unital, simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra with a unique tracial state,
such that the Cuntz semigroup Cu(A) does not have the Corona Factoriza-
tion Property for semigroups.

Proof. Recall that γl denotes the universal line bundle over CP l for each
l ∈ N. For each integer n ≥ 0, deﬁne a vector bundle ηn over Xn by

η0 := γκ(0),

and ηn :=

κ(n)

ζn, for n ≥ 1.

For each n ∈ N0, let qn ∈ An ⊗ K denote the projection corresponding to
ηn. Let xn := hϕn∞(qn)i ∈ Cu(A) and e := h1Ai ∈ Cu(A). We show that
j=0 xj. Since e is compact in Cu(A), it
j=0 xj for all k ∈ N. In the interest of brevity,

e ≤ 6xn, for all n ∈ N, while e 6≤P∞
is suﬃcient to prove e 6≤ Pk

for each n ∈ N0, let rn ∈ An ⊗ K denote the projection

rn :=

that is Pn

Fix k ∈ N. For each n ∈ N0, let ωn denote the vector bundle

ωn :=

κ(l)π1∗

over Xn. Then ωn is the vector bundle corresponding to rn. Indeed, this
statement is obviously true for n = 0. Assume the statement is true for

it follows from (7) that

In particular, it follows that ϕ∗

ξn denotes the vector bundle over Xn corresponding to the unit pn ∈ An.
Since the Euler characteristic e(ωn) is non-zero by the K¨unneth formula,
and θ1 - ξn for all n ∈ N it follows that ϕ∗

As e is compact in Cu(A), it therefore follows from continuity of the functor

Fix n ∈ N. By construction of the sequence (κ(k))k∈N, we ﬁnd that

Furthermore, since κ(1) = 6 ≥ 2(1 + 1)! ≥ 1(1 + 1)!, we ﬁnd, by induction,

κ(n) = 2(n + 1)

κ(l) ≥ 2(n + 1)(cid:0)

Hence,

rank(ξn) + dim(Xn) ≤ 3κ(n) = rank(6ηn).

It therefore follows from [15, Theorem 9.1.2, Theorem 9.1.5] that ξn - ηn,
which completes the proof.
