(Dated: March 16, 2016)

In this paper we study segmented strings in AdS3 coupled to a background two-form whose ﬁeld
strength is proportional to the volume form. By changing the coupling, the theory interpolates
between the Nambu-Goto string and the SL(2, R) Wess-Zumino-Witten model.
In terms of the
kink momentum vectors, the action is independent of the coupling and the classical theory reduces
to a single discrete-time Toda-type theory. The WZW model is a singular point in coupling space
where the map into Toda variables degenerates.

INTRODUCTION

Segmented strings in ﬂat space are piecewise linear
classical string solutions: at a given time their shape is
a union of straight string segments. Kinks between the
segments move with the speed of light and their world-
lines form a lattice on the worldsheet. This idea can
be generalized to AdS3 (or more generally to (A)dSn)
where the embedding is built from AdS2 patches [1, 2].
The construction provides an exact discretization of the
non-linear string equations of motion (as opposed to ap-
proximate discretizations used for instance in [3]). For
recent developments, the reader is referred to [4–7].

In [8], the area of segmented strings has been computed
using cross-ratios constructed from the kink momentum
vectors. The cross-ratios were expressed in terms of
purely left-handed (or right-handed) Toda variables. In
this way, classical Nambu-Goto string theory in AdS3
could be reduced to an integrable time-discretized rela-
tivistic Toda-type lattice.

In [5], Gubser pointed out that the segmented string
evolution equations simplify if they are derived from
the SL(2, R) Wess-Zumino-Witten action.
In this the-
ory, strings couple to the three-form ﬁeld strength which
supports the AdS3 geometry.
(For the quantum the-
ory see [9].) If the three-form ﬁeld strength comes from
the Ramond-Ramond sector, then the WZW theory de-
scribes the motion of D1-branes, whereas the Nambu-
Goto action is appropriate for fundamental strings (F1).
In this paper we generalize [8] by considering F1-D1

bound states. Our starting point is the action [6]

where τ1 is the tension.
In order to simplify the for-
mulas, we set the prefactor to one (τ1 = −2). Y M are
coordinates on AdS3, h and G are the worldsheet and
background metrics, respectively. B is the background
two-form with ﬁeld strength proportional to the volume
form of AdS3. Finally, κ is its coupling to the worldsheet.

On causal grounds [6],
[−1, 1]. We can without loss of generality restrict κ to be
non-negative.
The equations of motion derived from (1) are exactly
solved by segmented strings. These can be built by gluing
diamond-shaped worldsheet patches. Each patch borders
four others along null kink lines.

Let us consider the patch in FIG. 1. The four vertices
in the R2,2 embedding space of AdS3 are labeled by Vij .
We have V 2
ij = −1. The boundary of the worldsheet
patch consists of four null kink lines. Let us deﬁne the
following kink momentum vectors

p1 = V01 − V00
p3 = V11 − V10
These vectors satisfy

p2 = V11 − V01
p4 = V10 − V00

(2)

p2
i = 0

and

p1 + p2 = p3 + p4

The latter equation can be interpreted as “momentum
conservation” during the scattering of two massless scalar
particles with initial and ﬁnal momenta p1,2 and p3,4,
respectively.

Let X(σ−, σ+) ∈ R2,2 denote the embedding function
of the string into spacetime where σ± are lightcone coor-
dinates on the worldsheet. The patch is bounded by

X(σ−, 0) = V00 + σ−p4
X(0, σ+) = V00 + σ+p1

From the interpolation ansatz, we have

V11 = X(1, 1).

(4)

This equality constitutes a discrete evolution equation
for segmented strings. The set of points in AdS3 null
separated from both V10 and V01 is a one-dimensional
locus, conveniently parametrized by V11(κ). Note that
at κ = 0, the interpolation ansatz gives an AdS2 patch
embedded into AdS3.

In the next section, we evaluate the action for a single
patch. The action can be written in terms of Mandel-
stam variables corresponding to kink momentum vectors.
Section III computes the Euler character for the string.
Section IV discusses the singular κ = 1 case where the
map into Toda variables degenerates. We ﬁnish with a
short discussion of the results.

This is precisely the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory.

B. Evaluating the action

Let us now evaluate action (1) for our worldsheet

patch. The metric and a canonical B-ﬁeld are

II. THE ACTION OF SEGMENTED STRINGS

The ﬁeld strength three-form is

The value of the action evaluated on the patch is
analogous to a scattering amplitude in four dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.
Instead of the Lorentz symme-
try, however, the action is invariant under the SO(2, 2)
isometry group of AdS3 and R2,2. The only independent
invariants are the Mandelstam variables s = (p1 + p2)2
and u = (p1− p4)2. The patch action then takes the form

Spatch = L2F (cid:16) u
s(cid:17)

where L is the AdS3 radius (henceforth set to one) and
In the following, we
F (x) is a dimensionless function.
will determine this function by evaluating the action for
patches that have been moved into a certain position.

A. Fixing the patch

Using the SO(2, 2) symmetry we can rotate/boost any
patch such that V00, V10, V01 are parametrized by two
numbers c and ˜c as follows

V00 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T
V10 = (1, c,−c, 0)T
˜c, 0)T .
V01 = (1, ˜c,

H = dB0 = −VolAdS3

Since H and the background metric are both SO(2, 2)
invariant, we expect that the patch action will also be
invariant and therefore it can be expressed in terms of
Mandelstam variables.

The κ = 0 case is straightforward and the results were
presented in [8]. At κ 6= 0, however, S(B0) depends sepa-
rately on c and ˜c and thus it cannot be expressed in terms
of Mandelstam variables which are functions of c˜c. This
is due to the fact that the bulk action alone is not gauge-
invariant if the worldsheet has boundaries. In order to
preserve gauge invariance, point particles with opposite
charges must be attached to the string endpoints. These
particles are charged under a one-form gauge ﬁeld A. The
minimal coupling is described by

SA = Z∂Σ

A

where ∂Σ is the worldsheet boundary. The variation of
the bulk worldsheet action under a gauge transformation
Λ can be canceled if we let A transform according to

B → B + dΛ
A → A + Λ

Our strategy will be the following. For a given B, we
choose A such that S + SA is SO(2, 2) invariant (and
thus a function of s, t, u). Clearly, A does not aﬀect
closed string motion because those worldsheets have no
boundaries. Using the gauge transformation above, we
set A = 0. As a result, SA vanishes and the entire patch
action will come from S. When the dust settles, all we
have done was a gauge transformation on B (and we can
forget about SA).

Consider the following B-ﬁeld

B =

1 − t
2z2b−
zb−
with b± ≡ 1 + t2 − 2t − x2 ± z2

dt ∧ dz +

x
zb−

dx ∧ dz

It is gauge-equivalent to B0 and – as we will see – gives
an SO(2, 2) invariant result.

Let us now evaluate (1) on the patch given by the
interpolation ansatz (5) using the expression above for
the B-ﬁeld. The purely geometrical part of the integrand
gives

I1 =

2c˜c

(c˜c (κ2 − 1) σ−σ+ − 1)2

The second term (proportional to the B-ﬁeld) gives

I2 = −κ2I1

(7)

(8)

Integrating I1 + I2 over the patch gives the value of the
action. We get

Spatch = Z 1

dσ−Z 1

dσ+(I1 + I2) = 2 log[1 + c˜c(1 − κ2)]
Combining these results with (6) results in the covariant
formula

Note that the expression is independent of κ.

C. Toda variables

The Mandelstam variables may be expressed in terms
of Toda variables as in [8]. In order to do this, the light-
like kink momenta p are written as products of helicity
spinors. We deﬁne

σµ = (1,−iσ2, σ1, σ3)
pa ˙a = σµ

a ˙apµ

Since p2 = det(pa ˙a) = 0, we can write

pa ˙a = λa˜λ ˙a

We will call λ left-handed spinors and ˜λ right-handed
spinors. In terms of these two-component variables, the
patch action can be written as

Spatch = 2 log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

hλ1, λ4ihλ2, λ3i

hλ1, λ2ihλ3, λ4i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

FIG. 2: Two adjacent patches on the worldsheet. V00 and V12
can be computed using the interpolation ansatz. Then, the
ﬁve left-handed Toda variables aij computed from the diﬀer-
ence vectors will satisfy the Toda-type equation of motion.

There is a similar formula in terms of right-handed
spinors. The spinor modulus drops out of the action.
Thus, by deﬁning the angles αi via

|λi|eiαi := λ1

i + iλ2

i

one can write

Spatch = 2 log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

sin(α1 − α4) sin(α2 − α3)

sin(α1 − α2) sin(α3 − α4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

The α angles are the global Toda variables. Let us further
deﬁne the left-handed Poincar´e Toda variables by

ai := tan αi .

For a kink momentum vector p ∈ R2,2, the left-handed
and right-handed Poincar´e Toda variables are simply
given by

a(p) =

p−1 + p2
−p0 + p1
In terms of these ﬁelds the patch action becomes

p−1 + p2
p0 + p1

˜a(p) =

,

(10)

The total action is then the sum of all patch contributions

(a1 − a4)(a2 − a3)

Spatch = 2 log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(a1 − a2)(a3 − a4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the i, j indices indicate the position of the kink
edge in the two-dimensional lattice (see FIG. 3). The
previously used one-index ak are

a1 → aij
a3 → ai−1,j+1

a2 → ai,j+1
a4 → ai−1,j

and aij sits on a white dot in the lattice, see FIG. 3.

ai,j − ai,j+1
This equation is independent of κ. It has been obtained
in [10] as the equation of motion of a time discretization
of a relativistic Toda-type lattice.

ai,j − ai+1,j

The validity of the above equation of motion can be
checked directly. Let us consider two adjacent patches
as in FIG. 2 and ﬁx four vertices V10, V11, V01, V02 in
R2,2 such that neighboring vertices are lightlike sepa-
rated. The interpolation ansatz (3) then gives1 V00 and
V12. The left-handed Toda variables aij can be computed
from the kink momentum vectors. We claim that these
variables satisfy the above equation of motion.

The calculation is straightforward using a computer al-
gebra program, but the formulas are too large to present
here. Therefore we only sketch the proof. One might
start with the following “forward null triple”

V01 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T
V11 = (1,qc2
V02 = (1,qc2

1 + c2

4, c3, c4)T .

supplemented by another vertex V10 which satisﬁes

V 2
10 = −1

and

(V10 − V11)2 = 0 .

Altogether there are six real constants parametrizing the
vertices. Note that V01 is ﬁxed, but apart from this the
ansatz is generic.
In principle, one could start with a
completely generic null triple ansatz, but then the for-
mulas become prohibitively complicated.
Instead, we
ﬁx V01, and we perform a global SO(2, 2) = SL(2)L ×
SL(2)R transformation on the kink momentum vectors
before the ﬁnal step when the Toda variables are com-
puted. Note that left-handed variables are invariant un-
der SL(2)R and thus it is enough to consider SL(2)L
rotations. The resulting Toda variables do satisfy the
equation of motion.

III. EULER CHARACTER

In this section, for pedagogical reasons, we study the

Euler character

χ =

1

4π Z d2σ√−g R .

Let us consider a worldsheet with torus topology2. Such
worldsheets are known to give χ = 0. In the following,
we will check this result for segmented strings.

Using the interpolation ansatz (3) and σ± = 1
the induced metric is diagonal with components

2 (τ ± σ),

gσσ = −gτ τ =

c˜c

(τ 2 − σ2) c˜c(cid:1)2 .

(cid:0)1 + 1−κ2

4

The Ricci scalar computed from g is constant away from
kink collision vertices

R0 = −2(1 − κ2)

(13)

Let us decompose the Euler character as an integral away
from the vertices plus integrals at the vertices

4πχ = R0Z d2σ√−g +Xi

ZVi

d2σ√−g R .

(14)

Here the sum is over kink vertices and Vi labels an in-
ﬁnitesimally small area around the ith vertex.
Let us momentarily set κ = 0. From the appendix of

[8], we have

ZVi

d2σ√−g R κ=0= 8 log cos

φi
2

where φi is deﬁned such that cos φi is the scalar prod-
uct of the normal vectors of the two space-like separated
patches around the ith collision point.

Denote the kink collision point by XM ∈ R2,2. Then,
two kink momentum vectors emanating from this point
span an AdS2 patch with normal vector [8]

N (α, β) =

1

sin(α−β)×




X0 cos(α − β) − X1 cos(α + β) − X2 sin(α + β)
−X−1 cos(α − β) − X2 cos(α + β) + X1 sin(α + β)
−X2 cos(α − β) − X−1 cos(α + β) + X0 sin(α + β)
X1 cos(α − β) − X0 cos(α + β) − X−1 sin(α + β)
Here α and β are the left-handed global Toda variables
corresponding to the two kink momentum vectors. Using
this formula, φi can be expressed and we arrive at

ground space and then the result was expressed in terms

must be reversed in the formula.

out going to the covering space. Equivalently, one may consider
time-periodic solutions in AdS3.

of AdS3 quantities (i.e. R2,2 normal vectors). The curva-
ture of the target space did not matter since the collision
of kinks was instantaneous. The Christoﬀel symbols can
therefore be neglected in a limit where we zoom in on
the collision point. Similary, we can argue that the three-
form ﬁeld strength can also be neglected in this limit and
thus (15) should be independent of κ.

By performing the sum over kink collisions we get

(16)

where now the indices of aij label positions in the kink
lattice, see FIG. 3. In the RHS, using the results of the
previous section, we recognize twice the total action (12).

Plugging (16) into (14) and using (13) we get

4πχ = −2(1 − κ2)A + 2Stotal

(17)

where A is the worldsheet area. From (7) and (8) the
integrand in the bulk action is

Itotal = I1 + I2 = (1 − κ2)I1

which, after integration, yields Stotal = (1 − κ2)A. Plug-
ging this result back into (17) ﬁnally gives χ = 0.

IV. DEGENERATE WZW LIMIT

Classical solutions for the SL(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten

model are given by

g = g+(σ+)g−(σ−) ∈ SL(2, R)

How can such a (classically) trivial theory be mapped
into the non-trivial Toda-type theory? The answer is that
at κ = 1 the map is not surjective: segmented strings are
mapped into a smaller subspace of the Toda phase space3.
The fact that this point in coupling space is singular can
already be seen from (6) that gives u/s = −1 which is
independent of the c and ˜c patch parameters.
FIG. 3 shows the trivial subspace of the left-handed
Toda phase space. The aij variables sitting on the black
dots depend only on i + j and they are independent of
i − j. This means that the black dots grouped together
(blue shading) have the same values. This is clearly a
lower dimensional subspace. We have not included a sep-
arate (mirror) ﬁgure, but the right-handed variables ˜aij
are similarly degenerate: the ones sitting on white dots
depend only on i − j (and not on i + j).
The calculation is similar to the one in section II D.

Let us sketch the proof of degeneracy discussed above.

3 Note that for strings with |κ| < 1, only positive Toda solutions
play a role. These are the ﬁeld conﬁgurations for which elemen-
tary patch areas (11) are non-negative.

FIG. 3: Kink worldlines form a rectangular lattice on the
string worldsheet. The ﬁeld aij lives on the edges (black or
white dots depending on edge orientation). For κ = 1, the
variables grouped together are equal (blue shading).

Consider the following forward null triple

V00 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T

V10 = (cid:18)1, c1,−c2, qc2
V01 = (cid:18)1, ˜c1,

We now perform a global

R ∈ SO(2, 2) = SL(2)L × SL(2)R

transformation on the kink momentum vectors which
transforms V00 into a generic position. Left-handed vari-
ables are invariant under SL(2)R and thus it is enough
to consider w ∈ SL(2)L rotations. The left-handed Toda
variables computed from the diﬀerence vectors are
w11√˜c1 − ˜c2 + w12√˜c1 + ˜c2
w21√˜c1 − ˜c2 + w22√˜c1 + ˜c2

a1 ≡ a(R(V01 − V00)) =

a4 ≡ a(R(V10 − V00)) =

where a(p) denotes the Poincar´e Toda variable corre-
sponding to a kink momentum vector p, see eqn. (10).

The other two variables a2 and a3 depend on κ. They
are easy to compute, but the formulas are too large to
present here. They satisfy

a2 ≡ a(R(V11 − V01)) κ→1−→ a4
a3 ≡ a(R(V11 − V10)) κ→−1−→ a1

There are degeneracies in the right-handed variables

which can be proven in a similar fashion.

We ﬁnish this section with the following observation.
Let us exchange black and white dots in the lattice. This
duality exchanges patches and kink collision vertices and
changes the string embedding. After the transformation,
left-handed variables sitting on white dots along the same
kink line will be equal. This conﬁguration correspond to
trivial left-moving kinks (edges with black dots), since
they do not cause a time delay when they cross a right-
moving kink. Thus, this string embedding only contains
right-moving shockwaves and in the κ = 0 case it is equiv-
alent to Mikhailov’s construction [11].

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have computed the action of seg-
mented strings in AdS3. The worldsheet is coupled to
a background two-form whose ﬁeld strength is propor-
tional to the volume form. We have used the interpo-
lation ansatz of [6] to parametrize elementary patches.
Segmented string solutions are obtained by gluing the
patches along null boundaries (kink lines).

The null kink momentum vectors in the embedding
space R2,2 can be decomposed using helicity spinors.
Then, the action can be expressed in terms of cross-
ratios of the spinor angles. We have called both these

6

angles and their tangents “Toda variables”. Time evolu-
tion of segmented strings can be described by the evolu-
tion equation of a discrete-time Toda-type lattice. This
equation was presented in section II D.

Interestingly, the ﬁnal form of the action does not de-
pend on the two-form coupling κ. Thus, the theory
in terms of Toda variables treats the classical Nambu-
Goto theory (κ = 0) and the SL(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten
model (κ = 1) on the same footing. However, the latter
theory is a special one, because the map from the seg-
mented string into Toda variables degenerates as κ → 1.
This is seen in FIG. 3: the variables grouped together
will become equal at κ = 1. By performing a duality
that exchanges black and white dots in the lattice, WZW
solutions can be mapped to string solutions with purely
left- or purely right-moving kinks.

The results generalize those in [8] which can be ob-
tained by setting κ = 0. We have not discussed the re-
construction of string embeddings from solutions of the
Toda-like lattice. The procedure should be analogous to
the κ = 0 case.

An interesting question is how these ideas generalize
to other spacetimes (e.g. dSn or AdSn) and what kind of
Toda-like theories one would get by a similar reduction.
We leave this for future work.
