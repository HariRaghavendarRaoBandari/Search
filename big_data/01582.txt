Abstract. In this paper, we study the existence of SRB measures for inﬁnite dimensional dynamical
systems in a Banach space. We show that if the system has a partially hyperbolic attractor with
nontrivial ﬁnite dimensional unstable directions, then it has an SRB measure.

1. Introduction

In smooth ergodic theory of ﬁnite dimensional dynamical systems, SRB measures (named after Sinai,
Ruelle and Bowen who discovered them for uniformly hyperbolic attractors) are technically deﬁned
as those invariant measures which have smooth conditional measures on unstable manifolds, and this
property was in turn characterized as satisfying Pesin entropy formula (which, roughly speaking, is an
equality between entropy and exponential volume expansion rate along unstable manifolds, see [16])
([7]). When the system is dissipative and there is no zero Lyapunov exponent, SRB measures describe
the asymptotic behaviors of orbits with initial points in a positive Lebesgue measure set and thus are
recognized as being physically signiﬁcant. On the other hand, the theory of SRB measures has led to
signiﬁcant new ideas in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ([20]).

Which dynamical systems have SRB measures ? This has always been a challenging problem since
their discovery in the 1970s. Several classes of results have been obtained in this direction, including
partially hyperbolic attractors, H´enon-like attractors, strange attractors arising from Hopf bifurcations
etc. Here we do not try to cover these progresses in detail but rather refer to the survey paper [24],
the relevant Palis conjecture [15] and the book [2].

For better understanding of dynamical behaviors on attractors of dissipative partial diﬀerential
equations, a program of extending the ideas of smooth ergodic theory of ﬁnite dimensional dynamical
systems, especially of SRB measures, to inﬁnite dimensional setting was proposed by Eckmann and
Ruelle [3]. Several progresses have been made in this direction, among them we mention [13], [21],
[23], [9], [10], [11], [12], [8] and [1]. As for existence of SRB measures, we refer to [12] and [8].

As a sequel to [8] which mainly deals with Hilbert spaces, this paper is devoted to the existence of
SRB measures for inﬁnite dimensional systems in a separable Banach space. Employing ideas of [17]
and [25], we construct SRB measures on a partially hyperbolic attractor of a diﬀerentiable map in
such a Banach space with nontrivial ﬁnite dimensional unstable directions. Our aim is to understand
dynamical behaviors of the time-one map or a Poincar´e section map of the solution ﬂow for dissipative
partial diﬀerential equations (for example, a parabolic one) with a Banach phase space such as Lp,
p 6= 2 (see, for instant, [5]). As a consequence of our result, a partially hyperbolic attractor under
consideration is chaotic in the sense that it contains a full weak horseshoe as introduced in [6], since
Pesin entropy formula proved by [1] in case of Banach spaces together with the variational principle
gives positive topological entropy which, by [6], implies existence of such a horseshoe. We remark
that, as in the ﬁnite dimensional case, ﬁnding concrete examples of PDEs or ODEs, to whose time-one
maps or Poincar´e section maps the results are applicable, is possibly a more challenging problem.

In [8], we established the existence of SRB measures and their basic properties for partially hyper-
bolic attractors in a separable Hilbert space, where the Lebesgue measures and Jacobians play key
roles as in all the previous work on SRB measures. In an Euclidean space or a Hilbert space, an inner
product uniquely induces a system of Lebesgue measures in a natural way, and then the corresponding
Jacobians are naturally deﬁned and possess suﬃciently nice properties; while in Banach spaces, there
is no such obvious choice on the systems of Lebesgue measures. In this case, for each ﬁxed system
of Lebesgue measures, it is pointwise deﬁned and only possesses certain regularity. This makes the
method used in [8] not work, since one can not expect the density function of the target measure to
be continuous any more and it is diﬃcult to build the connection between the weak* limit properties
of the pushed forward Lebesgue measures on unstable manifolds and the target SRB properties. To
overcome this, we employ a much more delicate way which is inspired by Rohlin [19]. We need to
reformulate the concept of Lebesgue measures and Jacobians for ﬁnite dimensional objects (such as
subspaces or manifolds) and maps between those objects respectively. Some needed material about
Lebesgue measures in Banach spaces is given in Appendix A. In section 2 we introduce the set-up and
the main result. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of the result.

2. Settings and Main Results

Let (X, |·|) be a separable Banach space, f : X → X be a C 2 map. Let Dfx be the Fr´echet derivative

of f at point x ∈ X. The conditions below are assumed throughout:

C1) f is injective;
C2) There exist an f -invariant compact set Λ, on which Dfx is (i) injective,

and (ii) for all x ∈ Λ

κ(x) := lim sup

n→∞

1
n

log kDf n(x)kκ < 0,

where k · kκ is the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness of an operator;

C3) Λ is an attractor with basin U , i.e., U is an open neighborhood of Λ and

∩n≥0f n(U ) = Λ.

Recall that, for a linear operator T , kT kκ is deﬁned to be the inﬁmum of the set of numbers r > 0
where T (B), B being the unit ball, can be covered by a ﬁnite number of balls of radius r. Since
kT2 ◦ T1kκ ≤ kT2kκkT1kκ and kDf kκ ≤ kDf k is uniformly bounded on Λ, the limit in the deﬁnition
of κ(x) exists for any x ∈ Λ and is a measurable function. Also note that, by deﬁnition, kT kκ = −∞
if T is compact.

Remark 2.1. Note that some well-known results follow from the assumptions above immediately:

(i) By the compactness of Λ, there is always an f -invariant probability measure supported on Λ,

which we denote by µ.

(ii) By applying the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem, there is a full measure set Λ′ ⊂ Λ, on which
the notion of Lyapunov exponents can be introduced, we refer the reader to [13], [23] and [9]
for details.

(iii) Condition C2) implies that, for all x ∈ Λ′, there are at most ﬁnitely many non-negative Lya-

punov exponents.

(iv) Attractors are important because they capture the asymptotic behavior of large sets of orbits.
In general, Λ itself tends to be relatively small (compact and of ﬁnite Hausdorﬀ dimension)
while its attraction basin, which by deﬁnition contains an open set, is quite visible in the phase
space. Notice that our attractors are not necessarily global attractors in the sense of [4] and
[22].

For given x ∈ Λ, we deﬁne the unstable set of x as the following:
W u(x) = {y ∈ X|f −n(y) exists , ∀n ∈ N, |f −n(y) − f −n(x)| → 0 exponentially fast as n → +∞}.

2

By C3), we have W u(x) ⊂ Λ for all x ∈ Λ.

In general, W u(x) is an immersed manifold rather than an embedded one. To avoid these disad-

vantages, one can study the local invariant manifolds deﬁned below:

W u

r(x)(x) = {y ∈ B(x, r(x))| f −n(y) exists for all n ∈ N, |f −n(y) − f −n(x)|e−nλ(x) ≤ C(x), n ≥ 0},

where B(x, r) is the r-ball centered at x, r and C are positive tempered functions and λ is an f -
invariant function. In particular, given an f -invariant measure µ with ﬁnite many positive Lyapunov
exponents, there are measurable tempered functions r, C : Λ → R+ such that for µ-a.e. x ∈ Λ,
W u

r(x)(x) is an embedded ﬁnite dimensional disc with well controlled distortions.

In the current setting, one quick observation is that, for µ-a.e. x

+∞

W u(x) =

f n
f −n(x)(W u

r(f −n(x))(f −n(x))),

[n=0

which implies that W u(x) is an immersed manifold, since W u
injective and diﬀerentiable.

r(·)(·) is ﬁnitely dimensional and f is

By the deﬁnition of W u(x), it is obvious that W u(x) ∩ W u(y) 6= ∅ if and only if W u(x) = W u(y).

So, up to a µ-null set, Sx∈Λ W u(x) form a partition of Λ. Unfortunately, this partition may be not

measurable. We need to introduce the following concepts:

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let µ be an f -invariant Borel probability measure on Λ. A measurable partition P
of Λ is said to be subordinate to the unstable manifolds with respect to µ if, for µ-a.e. x ∈ Λ, one has
that P(x) ⊂ W u(x) (here P(x) denotes the element of P which contains x) and it contains an open
neighborhood of x in W u(x) (endowed with the submanifold topology).

Deﬁnition 2.2. An f -invariant Borel probability measure µ on Λ is called an SRB measure if for
every measurable partition P of Λ subordinate to the unstable manifolds with respect to µ one has

µP

x ≪ Lebx

for µ-a.e. x ∈ Λ, where µP
measure on W u(x) induced by norm of X.

x denotes the conditional measure of µ on P(x) and Lebx denotes a Lebesgue

We call f |Λ to be partially hyperbolic if the following holds: for every x ∈ Λ there is a splitting

which depends continuously on x ∈ Λ with dim Eu

X = Eu

x ⊕ Ecs

x > 0 and satisﬁes that for every x ∈ Λ

where λ0 > 0 is a constant.

The following is the main result we derived in this paper.

Theorem 2.3. If f |Λ is partially hyperbolic, then there exists at least one SRB measure of f with
support in Λ.

In this section, we assume that f |Λ is partially hyperbolic and prove Theorem 2.3.

local unstable manifolds theorem for partially hyperbolic systems.

Lemma 3.1. There exists a continuous family of C 2 embedded k-dimensional discs {W u

δ (x), where du denotes the distance along
the unstable discs, y−k is the unique point in Λ such that f ky−k = y, z−k is deﬁned similarly
and γ0 > 0, 0 < ε0 << λ0 are some constants;

(4) there is 0 < ρ < δ such that, if W u

ρ (x) := Expx(cid:0)Graph(hx|Eu

x (ρ))(cid:1) intersects W u

ρ (x) ⊂ W u

The existence of the local unstable manifold is following from the result of Section 9 in [9]; and to
prove the other parts, since one do not need to use inner product in particular, so the same proof of
Lemma 3.1 in [8] works here, so we omit the proof of this lemma.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 2.3. We construct an SRB measure µ by taking a weak* limit of the average
of a pushed forward Lebesgue measure on a local unstable manifold.

First, since Lebesgue measure deﬁned for a normed space depends on the choice of bases, we set up

a system of piecewisely continuous unit bases of Eu and ﬁx such a system in the rest argument.

Since the splitting X = Eu

x ⊕ Ecs

exists δ > 0 such that one can choose a unit basis ηy = {vi(y)}1≤i≤dim Eu of Eu
with

x varies continuously in x, for any small ǫ ∈ (0, 1) and x ∈ Λ, there
y for any y ∈ B(x, δ) ∩ Λ

(2)

dist(vi(y), span{vj(y)}1≤j≤i−1) > 1 − ǫ, 2 ≤ i ≤ dim Eu

and, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ dim Eu, vi(y) being continuous in y. By Lemma 4.1 of [9], we have that

(3)

dist(vi(y), span{vj(y)}j6=i) ≥(cid:18) 1 − ǫ

2 − ǫ(cid:19)dim Eu−1

(1 − ǫ).

Noting that Λ is compact, there exist ﬁnite points {xi}i∈I where I is a ﬁnite index set such that
Λ ⊂ ∪i∈I B(xi, δ). These balls generate a ﬁnite partition by taking intersections. By choosing basis
properly, we have constructed piecewisely continuous bases of the unstable linear ﬁbres {Eu

x }x∈Λ.

Let J u(x) = | detηx,ηf x(Dfx|Eu

x )| for x ∈ Λ , which is deﬁned by (20) in Section A.

Lemma 3.2. There is a constant C > 0 such that for any x ∈ Λ, y, z ∈ W u

where y−k is the unique point in Λ such that f ky−k = y and z−k is deﬁned similarly.

Proof. The proof is based on the Lipchitz continuity of Df and of the subspaces Eu restricted on
unstable manifolds. Note that, since Λ is compact, f is C 2, and the splitting Eu ⊕ Ecs is continuous,

kDf k, kπuk, kπcsk are uniformly bounded. For sake of convenience, we assume 0 < δ ≤ 1. By applying

Fix a point ˆx ∈ Λ and write L = W u

as i → +∞ for some subsequence {ni}i≥1 of the positive integers. Note that the existence of µ follows
from the compactness of Λ. We will show that such µ is an SRB measure.
Before starting the main proof, for sake of convenience, we ﬁrst assume

λL = µη ˆx ◦ πu

ˆx ◦ Exp−1
ˆx ,

where µη ˆx is the Lebesgue measure on Eu
to see that λL is a well deﬁned Lebesgue measure on L.

Let x ∈ Λ. Set Σx,ε = Expx(Ecs

ˆx induced by unit basis ηˆx. By (1) of Lemma 3.1, it is easy

x (ε))T Λ and let
Vx,ε = [y∈Σx,ε

W u

ρ (y).

By (4) of Lemma 3.1, we know that, when ε is small enough, Vx,ε is a union of pairwisely disjoint
pieces of W u
ρ (y) with y ∈ Σx,ε and it contains a neighborhood of x in Λ. By Lemma 3.1 and the
continuity of the splitting X = Eu ⊕ Ecs, for small enough ǫ > 0, each W u
ρ (y) ⊂ Vx,ǫ can be viewed
as the graph of a C 2 function h′
·k, with h′
y
and ρy varying continuously in y. By tailoring Vx,ǫ a little bit, one can obtain a subset V ′
x,ǫ of Vx,ǫ
such that

x,ǫ = [y∈Σx,ǫ

for some ρ0 > 0 with ρ0 ≤ ρy for all y ∈ Σx,ǫ. It is obvious that V ′
disjoint pieces of W u
we denote W u

x,ε is also a union of pairwisely
ρ (y) with y ∈ Σx,ε and it contains a neighborhood of x in Λ. For sake of simplicity,

x,ρ0(y) = graph(h′

x (ρ0)) for each y ∈ Σx,ǫ.

Since Λ is compact, we have a ﬁnite number of sets of this kind {V ′

x,ǫ} which cover Λ. With a bit
abuse of notation, let V = V ′
x,ε be an arbitrary one of these sets which satisﬁes µ(V ) > 0. Moreover,
since W u
x,ρ0(y) is contained in Λ for every y ∈ Λ, by shrinking ε and ρ0 if necessary, we may assume
that µ(∂V ) = 0 where ∂V is the boundary of V as a subset of Λ. Note that {W u
x,ρ0(y)}y∈Σx,ε produces
a measurable partition of V , which is denoted by ζ. Actually there exist countably many partitions
{ζn}n≥1 of V satisfying that
Par1) For each n ∈ N, ζn consists of ﬁnitely many elements;
Par2) For any A ∈ ζn, A = ∪y∈SW u

x,ρ0 for some S ⊂ Σx,ǫ, and µ(∂A) = 0, where ∂A is the boundary

of A as subset in Λ;

Par3) maxA∈ζn { diameter of A ∩ Σx,ǫ} → 0 as n → ∞.

Let (µ|V )y be the conditional probability measure of µ|V (the restriction of µ to V ) on W u

x,ρ0(y),
and ν be the induced measure of µ|V on quotient space V / ∼ where ∼ is an equivalent relation that
z1 ∼ z2 if and only if there exists y ∈ Σx,ǫ such that z1, z2 ∈ W u
x,ρ0(y). Note that ν also induces a
measure on Σx,ǫ, and, with a little abuse of notation, we will not distinguish them and use ν to denote
both.

It is then easy to see that µ will be an SRB measure if, neglecting a set of µ|V -null set, we have

(10)

(µ|V )y ≪ λu
y

on every piece W u
and without losing any generality, we let

x,ρ0(y), where λu

y is a Lebesgue measure on W u

x,ρ0(y). Again, for sake of convenience

λu
y = µηx ◦ πu

x ◦ Exp−1
x ,

where µηx is the Lebesgue measure on Eu

x induced by the unit basis ηx.

For each n ≥ 0, let

Ln = {z ∈ L : f nz ∈ W u

x,ρ0(y) for some y ∈ Σx,ε but f nL 6⊃ W u

x,ρ0(y)}.

From (3) and (4) of Lemma 3.1, we have that, for any z ∈ Ln, du(z, ∂L) ≤ 4
because, otherwise, for any z′ ∈ W u
3.1,

x,ρ0(y), by (4) of Lemma 3.1, z′ ∈ W u

3 δγ0e−n(λ0−ǫ0). This is
y (δ), then by (3) of Lemma

du(z, z′

−n) ≤ γ0e−n(λ0−ǫ0)du(f nz, z′) ≤

δγ0e−n(λ0−ǫ0),

which implies that z′ ∈ f nL and thus W u
know that λL(Ln) → 0 exponentially fast as n → +∞. Thus

x,ρ0(y) ⊂ f nL, resulting in a contradiction. Therefore, we

For each n ≥ 0, pn : V → (0, +∞) is clearly measurable. Noting that (4) holds, by applying the

where C ≥ 1 is a constant which depends only on the system constants. Therefore, by Lemma 3.2
and the above estimate, we have that there exists a constant C ≥ 1 which depends on the system
constants only such that

Now we prove (10). First, we consider the cylindrical sets

AS,F = [y∈S

Expx(graph(h′

y|F )),

where S ⊂ Σx,ǫ and F ⊂ Eu
given small ǫ′ > 0 there exist a compact set K and an open set U such that

x (ρ0) are Borel subsets. Since µηx is regular and µηx(F ) < ∞, for any

K ⊂ F ⊂ U ⊂ Eu

x (ρ0) and µηx (U ) − µηx (K) < ǫ′.

Consider a Borel set S ⊂ Σx,ǫ satisfying

(15)

µ(cid:0)∂(cid:0)∪y∈SW u

x,ρ0(y)(cid:1)(cid:1) = 0.

We denote ∂S the boundary of S , So the interior of S and S the closure of S as subset of Σx,ǫ. By
Lemma 3.1 and also noting that µ(∂V ) = 0, it is easy to see that

µ(cid:0)∂(cid:0)∪y∈SW u

x,ρ0(y)(cid:1)(cid:1) = µ(∪y∈∂SW u

x,ρ0(y)).

Denote Λk = f k(L \ Lk) ∩ Σx,ǫ. Then, by combining (26), (11), (12), (14) and (15), and by applying

By (15), we have that

Noting that µηx (U ) − µηx(K) < ǫ′ and ǫ′ can be taken arbitrarily small, hence

µ(AS,F ) ≥ µ(AS,F ) − µ(∂(∪y∈S W u
µ(AS,F ) ≤ µ(ASo,F ) + µ(∂(∪y∈S W u

Now we are ready to show that for ν-a.e. y ∈ Σx,ǫ, (µ|V )y ≪ λu

of countably many open subsets of Eu
σ-algebra. Such ξ can be constructed by collecting intersections of Eu
points from a countable dense subset of Eu
containing ξ, it is easy to see that ξd consists of countably many elements. Denote ζ 0

y . Let ξ = {Fn}n∈N be a collection
x (ρ0) such that the minimal σ-algebra containing ξ is the Borel
x (ρ0) with balls centered at
x (ρ0) with rational radii. Let ξd be the minimal algebra
d the minimal
n = {interior of A| A ∈ ζn} and ζn is as in (9). Note that ζ 0
d
consists of countably many elements and induces an algebra on Σx,ǫ \ ∪∞
n=1∂ζn by projection along
unstable ﬁbers, which we denote by ζ 0
Σ,d. The Borel σ-algebra on Σx,ǫ \ ∪∞
n=1∂ζn can be generated by
ζ 0
Σ,d because of properties Par3). Then, by the Carath´eodory Extension Theorem and by employing
the concept of outer measure and property Par2), we have that for any Borel measurable set A ⊂ Σx,ǫ

Then (17) implies that

µηx (F ) ≤ (µ|V )y(AΣx,ǫ,F ∩ W u

x,ρ0(y)) ≤ Cµηx(F ) for ν − a.e. y ∈ Σx,ǫ.

for any y ∈ Σ′,

(18)

C

µηx(F ) ≤ (µ|V )y(AΣx,ǫ,F ∩ W u

x,ρ0(y)) ≤ Cµηx(F ) for each F ∈ ξd.

Then, by applying Carath´eodory Extension Theorem and employing the concept of outer measure
again, we have that for ν-a.e. y ∈ Σx,ǫ and any Borel measurable set G ⊂ W u

(µ|V )y(G) = inf(cid:8)(µ|V )y(AΣx,ǫ,F ∩ W u

xExp−1(G) ⊂ F ∈ ξd(cid:9) .

Also note that µηx(πu

which implies that (10) is true for µ|V -a.e. y ∈ V . Since the Lebsesgue measures deﬁned on an
embedded ﬁnitely dimensional disc are equivalent, the validity of (10) does not depend on the choice
of Lebesgue measure λu

y . The proof is completed.

Appendix A. Lebesgue Measures in Normed Spaces

It is well known that the Lebesgue measure is not intrinsically deﬁned for ﬁnite dimensional normed
spaces. For our purpose in this paper, we need to assign Lebesgue measures for ﬁnite dimensional
subspaces in Banach spaces (which are normed spaces), and for C 1 graphs of maps whose domain
is a ﬁnite dimensional subspace, with which the determinant of linear transformations between these
subspaces are well deﬁned. The following well-known Theorem is due to Haar:

Theorem A.1. If λ is a translation-invariant measure on Rn for which all compact sets have ﬁnite
measure and all open sets have positive measure, then λ is a constant multiple of the Lebesgue measure.

The Radon-Nikodym derivative of one Lebesgue measure with respect to another deﬁned for a given
ﬁnite dimensional normed space is then a positive constant. The following results are not new, but for
sake of completeness, we include the proof here. For a systemic introduction, we refer to the survey
paper [14].

Let V, W be two k-dimensional normed spaces and Rk be the k-dimensional Euclidian space, µ be
the Lebesgue measure on Rk such that µ([0, 1]k) = 1. Let ηV = {vi}1≤i≤k ⊂ V, ηW = {wi}1≤i≤k ⊂ W
be unit bases. Then we deﬁne

LηV : Rn → V, LηV ei = vi, and LηW : Rn → W, LηW ei = wi.

Since LV , LW are linear homeomorphisms, they induce complete measures µηV , µηW and σ-algebras of
Lebesgue measurable sets on V, W respectively, for which all compact sets have ﬁnite measure and all
open sets have positive measure. Let T : V → W be a linear operator (thus bounded since the spaces
have ﬁnite dimension). With µηV and µηW , and also noting that L−1
ηW T LηV is an n × n matrix, we
deﬁne

(20)

det
ηV ,ηW

(T ) = det(L−1

ηW T LηV ).

A immediate consequence of this deﬁnition is the following property: let T1 : V1 → V2 and T2 : V2 → V3
be linear operators between k-dimensional normed linear spaces and η1, η2, η3 be unit basis of V1, V2, V3

respectively, then

The following lemma gives the relation between the norm and determinant of operators.

Obviously, these measures depend on the choice of the bases. However, the ratio of two such
measures can be controlled. We summarize it as the corollary below which follows from Lemma A.2 if
one take V = W and T = id. To save notations, we still use ηV , ηW as two arbitrary unit bases and
µηV , µηW the corresponding induced measures.

Corollary A.3. Suppose min{dist(vi, span{vj}j6=i), dist(wi, span{wj}j6=i)} ≥ α > 0, then there exists
a constant K > 0 such that for any Lebesgue measurable set A ⊂ V with µηV > 0,

In the case of V = W , let T : V → V be such that T (vi) = ui, 1 ≤ i ≤ k where ηV = {vi}1≤i≤k is a

the choice of basis.

Appendix B. Measure Theory

In this section, we include a basic result from measure theory. Let X be a compact metric space,
and denote M(X) the collection of probability measures on X. M(X) is a compact metrizable space

endowed with the weak-∗ topology (measures µi → µ in M(X) if and only ifRX gdµi →RX gdµ for all

continuous functions g : X → R). The following lemma is elementary but we include the proof here
since we need the arguments.

Lemma B.1. Let µi → µ in M(X). Then for any Borel V ⊂ X with µ(∂V ) = 0 one has

Proof. First, we show that for any open set U and closed set F ⊂ U

lim
i→∞

µi(V ) = µ(V ).

lim sup

i→∞

µi(F ) ≤ µ(U ).

It is trivial when F = ∅. Otherwise, by applying Urysohn’s lemma, there exists a continuous function
g : X → [0, 1] with support in U and g(z) = 1 when z ∈ F . Then

lim sup

i→∞

µi(F ) = lim sup

1dµi = lim sup

i→∞ (cid:18)ZX

gdµi −ZX−F

gdµi(cid:19)

i→∞ ZF
i→∞ ZX

≤ lim sup

gdµi =ZX

gdµ ≤ µ(U ).

Note that X − F is open, X − U is closed and X − U ⊂ X − F . Therefore

1 − lim inf
i→∞

µi(U ) = lim sup

i→∞

µi(X − U ) ≤ µ(X − F ) = 1 − µ(F ),

which implies that

lim inf
i→∞

µi(U ) ≥ µ(F ).

12

Also note that U is an Fσ set. Then, by the arbitrariness of F , we have that

(26)

lim inf
i→∞

µi(U ) ≥ µ(U ).

By the arbitrariness of U and applying (26) to X − U , we obtain that for any closed subset F ⊂ X

(27)

lim sup

i→∞

µi(F ) ≤ µ(F ).

For any Borel set V , applying (26) and (27) on V o, the interior of V , and on V , the closure of V ,
respectively, we have that

µ(V o) ≤ lim inf
i→∞

µi(V o) ≤ lim sup
i→∞

µi(V ) ≤ µ(V ).

If µ(∂V ) = 0, then µ(V o) = µ(V ) and the above inequalities become equalities. This competes the
proof.
