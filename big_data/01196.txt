This thesis is devoted to the application of random matrix theory to the study of random sur-
faces, both discrete and continuous; special emphasis is placed on surface boundaries and
the associated boundary conditions in this formalism. In particular, using a multi-matrix
integral with permutation symmetry, we are able to calculate the partition function of the
Potts model on a random planar lattice with various boundary conditions imposed. We pro-
ceed to investigate the correspondence between the critical points in the phase diagram of
this model and two-dimensional Liouville theory coupled to conformal ﬁeld theories with
global W -symmetry. In this context, each boundary condition can be interpreted as the de-
scription of a brane in a family of bosonic string backgrounds. This investigation suggests
that a spectrum of initially distinct boundary conditions of a given system may become
degenerate when the latter is placed on a random surface of bounded genus, effectively
leaving a smaller set of independent boundary conditions. This curious and much-debated
feature is then further scrutinised by considering the double scaling limit of a two-matrix
integral. For this model, we can show explicitly how this apparent degeneracy is in fact
resolved by accounting for contributions invisible in string perturbation theory. Altogether,
these developments provide novel descriptions of hitherto unexplored boundary conditions
as well as new insights into the non-perturbative physics of boundaries and branes.

Introduction

This thesis concerns the application of the theory of random matrices to the foundations of

string theory and the quantum mechanical description of gravitation, or quantum gravity

for short. A major motivation is that the tools of random matrix theory afford us a uniquely

detailed window into the quantum physics of strings and gravity beyond the perturbative

expansion in the string coupling. In particular, geometric objects such as boundaries and

branes acquire a simple interpretation in terms of averages of characteristic polynomials of

random matrices. Below we brieﬂy review the history of work that has intertwined these

subjects, with a view towards the open problems addressed in this work, and subsequently

provide an outline of the following chapters.

1.1 History of the subject

The application of the theory of random matrices to problems in physics was pioneered by

Wigner in the ﬁﬁties of the last century [1]. Since its inception, this ﬁeld has expanded

tremendously and today, the applications of random matrix theory include areas as diverse

as signal processing, number theory in mathematics, RNA folding in biology, and portfolio

optimisation in ﬁnance [2]. In the subsequent decade, Tutte initiated the enumeration of

planar maps [3, 4], deﬁned as graphs embeddable in the plane, modulo homeomorphisms.

1

Chapter1. Introduction

When endowed with a statistical lattice model deﬁned thereon, the detailed knowledge of

the asymptotic properties of maps with a large number of vertices allows a rigorous def-

inition of the path integral for two-dimensional gravity coupled to matter or equivalently,

bosonic string theory in a non-critical target space dimension. The classiﬁcation of bound-

ary conditions that can consistently be imposed on the boundary of the graph then provides

important insights into the spectrum of the theory.

The intimate relationship between the above two subjects ﬁrst emerged when ‘t Hooft

observed that averages of inﬁnite matrices admit an expansion in planar diagrams [5]; the

connection to the enumeration of planar maps was further ﬂeshed out in the seminal works

of Brezin et al. and Bessis et al. [6, 7]. In the eighties, David, Ambjørn et al. and Kaza-

kov et al. exploited these insights to compute obervables in pure two-dimensional quantum

gravity [8, 9, 10, 11] or equivalently, strings propagating in a zero-dimensional target space.

These investigations revealed a powerful connection between the combinatorial problems at

hand and algebraic geometry: for example, using random matrices, Boulatov and Kazakov

discovered that the generating function for planar triangulations, weighted by the partition

function of the Ising model deﬁned thereon, can be obtained as the solution to a polyno-

mial equation [12, 13]. As a result, upon analytic continuation, this generating function

deﬁnes a Riemann surface called the spectral curve – see Figure 1.1 for a cartoon of this

correspondence.

Shortly afterwards, Kazakov introduced a multi-matrix integral that describes the Potts

model on a random lattice [14], which is a generalisation of the Ising model dating back to

[15]. In the same year, a breakthrough by Distler and Kawai allowed for the development

of a complementary description of two-dimensional quantum gravity using Liouville con-

formal ﬁeld theory [16], leading to signiﬁcant efforts to work out the correspondence to the

random matrix description in the following decade: First, Lian and Zuckerman determined

the physical Hilbert space of Liouville theory coupled to the so-called Virasoro minimal

models [17], of which the critical Ising model is a special case. Good agreement with the

2

Chapter1. Introduction

(right).

random matrix description was found following the solution of the so-called two-matrix

model by Daul, Kazakov and Kostov [18]. These developments were preceeded by the dis-

covery of the double scaling limit of matrix models by Douglas and Shenker [19], in which

large maps of arbitrary genus contribute to the asymptoic behaviour.

Then in the mid-nineties, Daul found exact solutions for Kazakov’s random matrix de-

scription of the Potts model on a random lattice [20]. Around the same time, Speicher re-

ported on the connection between sums of independent random matrices and Voiculescu’s

free probability theory [21, 22]. Only a few years later, Carroll, Ortiz and Taylor calculated

the partition function of the Ising model on the randomly triangulated disk for all indepen-

dent boundary conditions by considering the average of the sum of two correlated random

matrices [23, 24], a task still to be completed for the Potts model on random planar maps.

Indeed, for the Potts model on a ﬁxed lattice, a complete set of boundary conditions was

only described a year later by Afﬂeck, Oshikawa and Saleur [25]. With the advent of the

new millenium, a classiﬁcation of boundary conditions for Liouville theory was achieved

by Fateev, the Zamolodchikov brothers and Teschner [26, 27, 28]. Building on this, Seiberg

and Shih subsequently developed the string theoretic interpretation of Liouville theory cou-

3

Chapter1. Introduction

pled to the Virasoro minimal model, in which the boundary conditions correspond to ex-

tended objects called branes [29, 30]. Curiously, a degeneracy in the states describing such

boundary conditions was conjectured, implying that boundary conditions that are distinct

for a matter system on a ﬁxed background can be rendered indistinguishable when coupled

to gravity. This conjecture was later challenged by matrix model calculations performed

by Atkin, Wheater and Zohren [31, 32].

Despite this being a fairly mature research ﬁeld with a well-developed literature, a

complete understanding of the allowed set of boundary conditions and their relationships

has not yet been achieved even for simple models; the work described herein is an attempt

to make progress towards ﬁlling these gaps.

1.2 Outline of the thesis

This thesis is organised as follows: In Chapter 2, we set the stage by introducing the concept

of a matrix model and reviewing the description of boundaries and branes, employing the

connections of random matrices to combinatorics, conformal ﬁeld theory and string theory.

After this prelude, the prerequisites are at hand to present the author’s original contributions

in three main chapters:

We begin by introducing Kazakov’s multi-matrix model with permutation symmetry

that describes the Potts model on a random lattice in Chapter 3. In this context, we gen-

eralise the work of Voiculescu and Speicher [33, 21] to the addition of correlated random

matrices. Using Afﬂeck et al.’s classiﬁcation [25] of boundary conditions for the Potts

model as a guide, this enables us to compute the partition function of the model on the ran-

domly triangulated disk for a whole family of boundary conditions exactly, thus extending

the results [23, 24, 31, 32] for the Ising model obtained by Carroll and others. We deduce

novel relationships between these boundary conditions and investigate the phase diagram

to derive the scaling behaviour of the generating functions when the coupling constants

4

Chapter1. Introduction

approach a critical point. The results of this chapter have been reported in the publications

[34, 35].

In Chapter 4, we take advantage of the scale-invariance arising at the above-mentioned

critical points to develop a description of the scaling functions using conformal ﬁeld the-

ory. The permutation symmetry of the matrix model and the conformal symmetry get en-

hanced to a larger continuous symmetry whose generators satisfy the so-called W -algebra.

We investigate the space of physical states for string worldsheets of both spherical and

disk topology. On the sphere, our treatment extends the work of Lian, Zuckerman and

Bouwknegt [17, 36] on Liouville theory coupled to the aforementioned minimal models,

whose symmetries are captured by the smaller Virasoro algebra. Moreover, on the disk, the

degeneracy of boundary conditions of the latter system observed by Seiberg and Shih [29]

is found to persist in the more general case under study.

In Chapter 5, employing the double scaling limit, we go beyond the conformal ﬁeld

theory description and study the description of branes non-perturbatively for speciﬁc cases.

This will reveal novel and important differences that are not visible in the asymptotic ex-

pansion in the string coupling which follow from a careful counting of independent degrees

of freedom. In particular, we ﬁnd that the above-mentioned degeneracy is resolved upon

inclusion of contributions from maps of unbounded genus and different boundary condi-

tions capture truly independent degrees of freedom, thus potentially resolving the debate

initiated in [31, 32]. The results of this chapter will be part of a forthcoming publication

[37].

Finally in Chapter 6, we summarise the key results that follow from the above investi-

gations and comment on possible further applications and future developments.

Review of the Hermitian Matrix Model

This chapter introduces the so-called Hermitian matrix model. This review will necessar-

ily be incomplete and biased towards the applications in this thesis; more comprehensive

reviews of these topics include [38, 39, 40]. We deﬁne the Hermitian matrix model as a
probability measure for an N × N Hermitian matrix X,

dm (X ) =

1
ZN

e−NtrV (X)dX ,

(2.1)

for a polynomial V (x) = (cid:229)

k+2
m=2 tmxm/m, where dX denotes the integration over independent

components,

dX = (cid:213)

1≤i≤ j≤N

1≤i< j≤N

dReX i
j

dImX i

j .

(2.2)

Here, the partition function ZN normalises expectation values such thatR dm (X ) = 1. The

above measure is invariant under the adjoint action of the unitary group, in components

j −→ ˜X i
X i

j = U i

l U l∗j

, U ∈ U (N) .

(2.3)

When k = 0, dm (X ) deﬁnes the so-called Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) – one of

6

(cid:213)
Chapter2. ReviewoftheHermitianMatrixModel

Wigner’s three ensembles1 [1]. All results in this thesis pertain to the generalisation of

this to the following probability measure on q Hermitian matrices:

dm (X1, X2, . . .Xq) =

1
ZN,q

hi ji

eNtrXiX j ×

q(cid:213)

i=1

e−NtrVi(x)dXi ,

(2.4)

where hi ji denotes the product over distinct i, j. As the main Chapters 3, 4 and 5 will con-
cern the so-called planar, scaling and double scaling limits of the model (2.4), we introduce

these limits in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 below for the simpler model (2.1). In doing so,

we elucidate their connection to random planar maps, boundary conformal ﬁeld theory and

branes in string theory, respectively. Worked examples at the end of each section illustrate

the relative ease with which results free of approximations can be obtained in these limits.

2.1 Planar Limit

In Chapter 3, we will be interested in the large-N spectral density of sums of random
matrices of the form X1 +X2 + . . . Xp, 1 ≤ p ≤ q, distributed according to (2.4). To this end,
we shall discuss the application of the saddle point method in the large N limit in Subsection

2.1.1, ﬁrst discussed in [6]. To pave the way for the interpretation of the measure (2.4) as

a description of the Potts model on a random lattice, we proceed to review the connection

to statistical physics on planar surfaces in Subsection 2.1.2, which will reveal the origin of

the term “planar limit” for N → ¥

.

2.1.1 Saddle point equations

Given a Hermitian random matrix X, we woud like to compute large-N spectral density,

deﬁned as

according to their respective symmetry groups.

i=1 denote the eigenvalues of X.

Introducing U ∈ U (N) such that UXU † is
where {xi}N
diagonal, we can integrate out the off-diagonal components by performing the integration

over the unitary group, allowing us to write the partition function as

ZN =

where D (x) = deti, j x j−1

cycle g ⊂ C. Note that when k is even and Re tk+2 > 0, we can always let X be Hermitian,
i.e. choose g = R. The saddle points are then given by the eigenvalue conﬁgurations

satisfying

V ′(xi) =

1 ≤ i ≤ N .
These are N coupled algebraic equations, with a total of N!(cid:0)N+k

(2.7)

N (cid:1) solutions, where the ﬁrst

factor arises from the invariance under permutations of eigenvalues, and the second from

the dimensionality of the space of integration cycles. Since the left-hand side of (2.7) is

holomorphic, we can anlytically continue this equation for any N. At this stage it is useful
to introduce the Stieltjes transform of r X ,

WX (z) =Zsupp r X

r X (x)

z ∈ C\ supp r X .

(2.8)

By construction, WX (z) computes the average of the trace of the resolvent (z− X )−1 for
large N:

WX (z) =

z− X(cid:29) + O(1/N) .

The normalised spectral density is obtained by inverting (2.8),

Here and in what follows we use the notation f (z)± = lime ց0 f (z ± ie ). We can conse-

quently rewrite the saddle point equation (2.7) as an equation for the Stieltjes transform of

the spectral density,

2.1.2 Statistical physics on planar lattices

The application of matrix integrals to the enumeration of random graphs was pioneered in

[5, 6, 7]. These developments have since been extended signiﬁcantly and we refer the reader

to [39, 40] for a more comprehensive overview of these topics. In his seminal work [5], ‘t

Hooft considered the new matrix integral obtained from ZN by expanding the exponential

in the integrand and reversing the order of integration of summation:

(2.17)

Because each term is polynomial in tm≥3, the above expression can be regarded as a formal
power series in these parameters. The quantity (2.17) is consequently referred to as a

formal matrix integral [41], an a priori different quantity than the convergent expression
(2.6). Equally, throughout this section, we will regard averages h·i as formal power series
in the parameters tm. An application of Wick’s theorem tells us that (2.17) can be evaluated

by a sum over closed fatgraphs, in which a given graph G with l internal lines and nm

vertices of coordination number m comes with a weight

where the contour C encloses supp r X counter-clockwise, we see that WX (z) may be un-
derstood as the generating function for planar maps with connected boundary, i.e. maps of

disk topology, where z is the fugacity of a boundary link. For this reason, WX (z) is also

referred to as the disk function. The partition function of the model on the disk is deﬁned

by dividing by the order of the automorphism group of the boundary – which is simply the

number of boundary links – at each order in z. Equivalently, WX (z) is the ﬁrst derivative of

the disk partition function:

2.2 Scaling limit

In Chapter 3, we will derive scaling limit of averages computed with (2.4); in Chapter 4,

we will study the same system using conformal ﬁeld theory. To set the stage, Subsections

2.2.1 and 2.2.2 therefore introduce this limit and discuss its connection to conformal ﬁeld

theory, respectively.

2.2.1 Phase diagram and critical points

The description of continuous surfaces via the critical behaviour of large random matrices

dates back to the seminal works of David, Ambjørn, Kazakov and collaborators [8, 9, 10,

11]. The planar limit may be understood as the thermodynamic limit of the eigenvalue
statistics: at inﬁnite N, averages are non-analytic in the fugacities {tm}k+2
m=2, which span a k-
dimensional phase diagram. Consequently, power series like (2.19) generally have a ﬁnite

radius of convergence. Tuning a single fugacity t j towards a critical value t j,c such that
we approach a (k− 1)-dimensional critical submanifold, the resulting universal behaviour
can be characterised by the scaling exponent g j of the second derivative of the planar free
energy,

¶ 2
¶ t2
j

F0 = const.× (t j − t j,c)−g j + terms analytic in t j .

(2.24)

Generally, we see from (2.19) that then

13

(cid:229)
Chapter2. ReviewoftheHermitianMatrixModel

NhtrX ji = const.× (t j − t j,c)1−g j + terms analytic in t j ,

(2.25)

which implies that the number of rooted planar maps with n j
bounded by a constant multiple of t−n j

j-gons is exponentially
g j−2 for large n j. In particular, when g j > 0,
the terms analytic in t j are subleading and the average number of j-gons contributing to the

j,c (n j)

average in (2.24) diverges linearly with the distance from the critical point4:

Assigning a ﬁxed length e
of the dimensionful surface area proportional e 2hn ji. Then the scaling limit is obtained by
sending t j → t j,c, e → 0, keeping m = (t j − t j,c)/e 2 and hence the dimensionful area ﬁxed.
For this reason, m

is also referred to as the renormalised cosmological constant. More

to each edge in the dual of G thus yields an expectation value

(2.26)

generally, for higher-order critical behaviour near lower-dimensional critical submanifolds,

the exact relationship between m and the fugacities {tm}k+2

m=2 depends more intrically on the
direction in which we approach the critical submanifold in question and was worked out

by Moore et al. [42], who coined the term conformal background for the scaling limit in
which no other couplings besides m are nonzero. A widely-used diagnostic discriminating
between different universality classes is the scaling exponent g s of the susceptibility

(2.27)

For a single random matrix with the measure (2.1), we can at most arrange for an algebraic

singularity of the form g s = 1/2− k; a more general algebraic singularity g s = −(k + 2)−1
can arise when we choose the measure (2.4) with q = 2 [18].

For graphs with boundaries, we can similarly let the average number of boundary links

t j, that is, for maps with a sufﬁcient number of marked j-gons.

, the disk function WX (z) develops a branch cut located at the support

of the eigenvalue density and the corresonding power series in z displays a ﬁnite radius of

convergence zc. Recalling that z is the fugacity of a boundary link, we introduce by analogy
the boundary cosmological constant via z = zc(1− em B). For 0 > g s > −1, the expansion
of WX (z) near the critical point is then of the form

WX (z) = WX (zc) + e c1m B + e 1−g sc2

Example 2.2.1. Consider again the case k = 2 with even V . Upon setting t2 = 1 and

applying Stirling’s approximation to the coefﬁcients in (2.23), one ﬁnds the number of

rooted planar quadrangulations grows asymptotically as 2/√p × 12nn−5/2, which implies
t4,c = −1/12 and g s = −1/2; this universality class describes a random planar surface

which has been called the “Brownian map” in the mathematics literature [43]. At the criti-

cal point, the spectral density (2.5) is proportional to (8−x2)3/2, so zc = √8. Approaching

this point via the parametrisation

t4 = t4,c(1− e 2m ) ,

z = zc(1 + em B/2) ,

e ց 0 ,

(2.30)

we ﬁnd the following expansion of the disk function:

In the dimensionless variables (2.29), the above can be succinctly summarised as the so-

lution to T3(z )− T2(Q) = 0, where Tn(x) denotes the nth Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst

kind.

Remark 2.2.2. Had we considered cubic V (k = 1), WX (z) would have become the generat-

ing function for rooted planar triangulations. The scaling limit would have given different
values of zc, c1 and c2, but the same value of g s, and the same form z and Q due to the
universality of the Brownian map.

2.2.2 Conformal ﬁeld theory description

Generally, the existence of critical points suggests that the universal properties of the scal-

ing limit can be captured by a scale-invariant ﬁeld theory. To see how this expectation is

borne out in Chapter 4, we will ﬁrst need to recall some crucial results and widespread

terminology. A general introduction to two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory is [44], the

foundations of which will be assumed to be familiar to the reader. Generalities of BRST

cohomology in the context of string theory are reviewed in [45]; for an overview on W -

algebras in conformal ﬁeld theory, see [46].

Distler and Kawai pioneered the deﬁnition of the measure on the space of physically

distinct conﬁgurations of the continuum surface taking advantage of the fact that any two-
dimensional metric g may be written in the conformal gauge g = f ∗(ej ˆg), where the f ∗
denotes the action of a diffeomorphism and the background metric ˆg is speciﬁed by a unique

point in moduli space – the ﬁnite-dimensional compact space of two-dimensional metrics

modulo diffeomorphisms and local Weyl transformations [16]. This change of variables

contributes a Jacobian to the measure which is the product of a contribution from the non-

invariance of the ﬁeld measures under Weyl transformations, leading to the appearance of
the Liouville action for the scalar ﬁeld j and a determinant which as usual can be written

as a functional integral over Grassmann-valued “ghost” ﬁelds b, c of spin -1 and 2; the

measure then displays a residual gauge invariance under the subset of diffeomorphisms

16

Chapter2. ReviewoftheHermitianMatrixModel

which preserve g up to a local Weyl transformation. In complex coordinates z = x + iy,
¯z = x− iy, the algebra of the latter is enlarged by the inﬁnitely many additional generators
ℓn = −zn+1¶ z, n ∈ Z of two copies of the Witt algebra

[ℓm, ℓn] = (m− n)ℓm+n ,

(2.32)

whose subalgebra with |n| < 2 exponentiates to the conformal group SL(2, C)/Z2. One way
to compute observables is via the conformal bootstrap, taking advantage of the fact that

invariance under (2.32) implies differential equations for correlation functions. Another

route represents the algebra (2.32) explicitly on a Fock space, which is the procedure we

shall employ. On the latter, (2.32) is represented only up to a phase, that is by operators Ln

generating the Virasoro algebra, which includes a central term

c
12

(m3− m)d m+n,0

(2.33)

in addition to the right-hand side of (2.32). In particular, when the statistical system deﬁned
on the random surface approaches its critical point, the Liouville ﬁeld j

interacts with an-

other conformal ﬁeld theory, frequently referred to as the matter theory and the total central
charge is given by c = cL + cM − 26, where cL and cM denote the central charges of the two
systems, offset by the negative contribution of the ghost ﬁelds. However, since here (2.32)

describes an algebra of residual gauge transformations arising from partial gauge ﬁxing, it

must be respected exactly so that c must vanish, thus ﬁxing cL given cM. This allows for

an interpretation of this theory as a description of bosonic strings propagating in a cM + 1-

dimensional target space. For this reason, we will sometimes also refer to the random
surface as the worldsheet of the string. As we shall see below, for cM /∈ [1, 25], the sus-
ceptibility exponent is determined by the celebrated Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov

(KPZ) relation [47]:

The subspace of physically distinct states – i.e.

those states in the Fock space that do

not differ by just a gauge transformation – is then obtained from the cohomology of the

nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) operator, whose holomorphic component is

(2.36)

Finite representations of (2.32) with cM ≤ 1 have been classiﬁed and are labelled by pairs
of simply laced Dynkin diagrams [48], constituing the Hilbert space of the so-called min-
imal models. In particular, the values of g s mentioned in the previous section identify the
universality classes describing highest critical point of a single random matrix with the
(A1, A2k) minimal model with cM = 10− 6[k + 2/(2k + 1)] and those of (2.4) with q = 2
with the (Ak+1, Ak+2) minimal model with with cM = 1− 6/[(k + 1)(k + 2)], respectively
coupled to Liouville theory; these will arise as special cases of the construction outlined

below. For an explicit expression for the BRST operator and the space it acts on, let us

ﬁx some deﬁnitions for the matter, Liouville and ghost systems. Because in Chapter 4 we

are looking for a conformal ﬁeld theory description of the scaling limit for (2.4), we will

consider the Wq minimal model as deﬁning the matter theory, which reduces to the afore-

mentioned minimal models for q = 1 and q = 2, respectively. For deﬁniteness, we begin by

discussing each system on the Riemann sphere, allowing us to choose the ﬂat background

dating back to [49] that can be speciﬁed by a positive integer q and a pair of coprime

integers (p, p′); here we describe their free-ﬁeld realisation paralleling the presentation in

In particular, when k is a positive integer and q ≥ 2, all primary ﬁelds come with a positive

root space inner product invariant, the weight (2.45) is invariant under l → wl , for w an

Requiring invariance under Weyl transformations ﬁxes the background charge in terms of
the Liouville coupling b as QL = (b + b−1)/√2; the cosmological constant m
responds to a marginal deformation. The relationship (2.34) can now be inferred by in-

then cor-

specting the change of the action under translations in ﬁeld space: according to the Gauss-

Bonnet theorem, upon shifting j → j + s , the second term in (2.50) contributes 2QLs
the change of the action. Moreover, choosing s = −ln m /(√2b) renders the third term in
(2.50) independent of m . Together with the invariance of the remaining contributions to the
measure, this implies that the partition function on the sphere obeys F0(m ) = m 2−g sF0(1),
where g s = 1− b−2; expressing b as a function of cM then yields (2.34). Since the short-
distance behaviour of ﬁelds is controlled by large negative values of j , we do not expect

to

the exponential interaction term to affect the expression for the central charge and confor-
mal weights. This allows us to set m = 0 throughout the remainder of this section. The

Let us now turn to the description of boundaries in the present context. Conformally in-

variant boundary conditions were determined in [26, 28, 56] for Liouville theory and in

[50, 51] for the Wq minimal model. Let us consider worldsheets with disk topology, and
for concreteness we shall map the disk interior to the upper half plane {z ∈ CP1|Im z > 0}
such that the boundary is located at z = ¯z.

so that in general we do not obtain two boundary states per primary ﬁeld as (2.67) might

suggest. For example, for (q, k) = (3, 1), there are 6 primary ﬁelds, but only 8 independent

boundary states [50].

as an additional marginal coupling as the Liouville action has to be augmented by a bound-

The parameter m B labels a family of Neumann boundary conditions on j along the real

2.3 Double scaling limit

In Chapter 5, we study averages of products of characteristic polynomials in the double-

scaling limit, employing the operator approach developed by Douglas [19] and applied to

the Hermitian two-matrix model by Daul, Kazakov and Kostov [18]. Below we shall deﬁne

the double scaling limit in the context of this formalism. The application of the theory of

monodromy preserving deformations of linear ordinary differential equations [59, 60, 61]

to the present context was developed by Moore [62, 63] – see also [64] for a more recent

discussion. Further details on this formalism can be found in the reviews [38, 39]; the

connection to the theory of integrable systems is reviewed in [65].

In the previous section, we saw that planar maps are an exponentially bounded family,

yielding convergent expressions for series expansions in {tm}k+2
m=3 for generic values of
the latter. Resting on the fact that generating functions for maps of ﬁxed positive genus

display the same radius of convergence, the topological recursion algorithm [66] yields

ﬁnite answers for the free energy Fh for maps of arbitrary genus h from the initial data at

h = 0. For large N, the free energy to all orders can then be estimated by an asymptotic
series12, in the following denoted by ‘≃’:
12Though ﬁnite at each order in 1/N, this estimate is formal because this series, neglecting exponentially

small corrections, has vanishing radius of convergence.

28

ZN ≃ exp  ¥

h=0

N2−2hFh! , N → ¥

.

(2.78)

At the boundary of the domain of analyticity, the scaling relation (2.27) generalises for the

genus-h free energy as

Fh = e (2−g s)(2−2h)Fh(m ) ,

(2.79)

where m
is the renormalised cosmological constant as deﬁned in the previous section. In-
troducing the string coupling gs = e g s−2/N, we recast (2.78) as an asymptotic expansion in
gs,

ZN ≃ exp  ¥

h=0

s Fh(m )! ,

g2h−2

gs → 0 .

(2.80)

We can thus retain signiﬁcant contributions from all topologies even at large N by taking

the double scaling limit N → ¥

, e → 0, keeping gs ﬁxed.

To study this limit effectively, we need a handle on contributions from all worldsheet

topologies that does not rely on the asymptotic expansion (2.80) about zero string coupling.

One way to achieve this is to employ the operator approach [19] for the measure (2.4) with

q = 2 and deg V1 = p, deg V2 = p′ for coprime integers p and p′, whose scaling limit
about the highest critical point is described by the (Ap−1, Ap′−1) minimal model coupled
to Liouville theory [18].
In this context, it is useful to study the exponentiation of the
operator N−1trln(x− X ) encountered in equation (2.21) of Subection 2.1.2: denoting the
contribution from connected surfaces by h·ic, the latter can be written as

hdet(x− X )i = exp(cid:16)Detrln(x−X) − 1Ec(cid:17)

1

n! h(trln(x− X ))nic! .

≃ exp  ¥

n=1

The large-N expansion of the above can be represented graphically as

(2.81)

thus accounting for an arbitrary number of boundaries with the same boundary condition

labelled by x. In the context of string theory, this expectation value is therefore interpreted

as the partition function of a brane at target space position x. More generally, the principal
objects of interest are averages of characteristic polynomials labelled by 1 ≤ n ≤ N,

a n(x) = hdet(x− X1)in×n ,

b n(y) = hdet(y− X2)in×n ,

and drop the subscript when b = −1. A symmetry of particular importance in Chapter 5 is
the duality transformation (p, p′) → (p′, p) as ﬁrst introduced in this context in [67]. From
(2.84) we see this amounts to the interchange of the matrices X1 and X2 – a deﬁnition that

32

Chapter2. ReviewoftheHermitianMatrixModel

extends to ﬁnite N and has been considered in [68, 69, 70, 71] under the name of spectral

duality. We observe that the effect of this transformation on the differential equations (2.91)

and (2.92) is, up to a coefﬁcient, the composition of the charge conjugation (2.94) and a

Laplace transform (2.96), namely

(P, Q) 7−→(cid:16)(−1)p′b −1

p,p′QT , (−1)p′b p,p′PT(cid:17) ,

(2.97)

and thus preserves the string equation (2.90).

We close this section by introducing a few concepts originating from the application of

the inverse monodromy problem to (2.91) and (2.92), which will be useful for the deﬁnition
of the spectral curve and the analysis of the semiclassical limit gs → 0. In brief, deﬁning

(2.100b)

which deﬁnes a Riemann surface Cp,p′(t) = {(z , Q) ∈ C2|G(t;z , Q) = 0}, called the spec-
tral curve14. In the semiclassical limit gs → 0, the coefﬁcients vn(t) and un(t) are approxi-
mately constant. To compare this limit to the results of conformal ﬁeld theory, we need to

choose the conformal background [42] described in Subsection 2.2.1. This limit was ﬁrst

computed in [18], with the result15

G(t;z , Q) =

lim
gs→0

1

2p−1(cid:0)Tp(Q)− Tp′(z )(cid:1) ,

(2.101)

where Tn(x) denotes the nth Chebyshev polynomial. This corresponds to the algebraic

equation satisﬁed by the dimensionless disk amplitude (2.29); as will become evident in
later chapters, the duality transformation (p, p′) → (p′, p) then reduces to the strong-weak
duality b → b−1 of the Liouville part of the conformal ﬁeld theory.
Example 2.3.1. (p, p′) = (2, 1). This describes the double scaling limit of the GUE. The
recursion relations (2.86) are solved by the nth Hermite polynomial Hn,

14This is to be contrasted with the proposal to deﬁne a ‘quantum’ spectral curve by generalising the notion

Sums of Random Matrices and the Potts

Model on Planar Maps

3.1 Overview

We compute the partition function W(p)(z) of the q-states Potts model [15] on a random
planar lattice with 1 ≤ p ≤ q allowed, equally weighted colors on a connected boundary,
where z denotes the fugacity of a boundary link. In the particular cases q = 2 and q = 3,

all of these correspond to boundary conditions of the Ising and Potts lattice models that

were found to be integrable on a ﬁxed lattice by Behrend and Pearce [74]. To this end,

we employ its matrix model formulation (2.4) as proposed long ago by Kazakov [14], who
used it to solve the limits q → 0 and q → 1.

In the particular case of random triangulations, W(1)(z) was ﬁrst found by Daul [20]
and later Zinn-Justin [75] in the saddle point approximation for integer 0 ≤ q ≤ 4, and by
Bonnet and Eynard [76, 77] using the method of loop equations, who found an algebraic

equation for W(1)(z) when arccos((q − 2)/2)/p

is rational; see also [78, 79] for related

results. More recently, the authors of [80] considered a combinatorial approach using the

so-called “loop-gas” representation of the Potts model on planar maps without reference

36

Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

to a matrix integral, from which a pair of coupled functional equations for W(1)(z) and a

function related to W(q)(z) was obtained and solved. For q = 2, the relationship between

W(1)(z) and W(2)(z) has been expressed succinctly from the perspective of the boundary

renormalisation group [23, 24], a picture which later was extended to non-planar geome-

tries [31] and arbitrary face degrees [32]. Indeed, these investigations revealed that different

boundary conditions yield inequivalent algebraic equations satisﬁed by the corresponding

generating functions. However, a systematic understanding of the relationship between dif-

ferent boundary conditions for more general values of q and p appears to be lacking and

herein we report on some progress on this matter.

As will be discussed in Section 3.2, W(p)(z) is given by the Stieltjes transform of the

spectral density of the sum p Hermitian random matrices of inﬁnite size. A more mathemat-

ically inclined characterisation of the problem solved in this chapter thus goes as follows:
q
given a set of Hermitian random matrices {Xi}
i=1 distributed according to (2.4) and a posi-
tive integer p ≤ q, what is the spectral density of the sum X1 +X2 +. . . Xp as N → ¥ ? For the

simpler case of uncorrelated matrices, the answer has been neatly summarised in the con-

text of free probability [21, 22], going back to Voiculescu’s observation of the asymptotic
freeness of Gaussian independent random matrices [33]: given a spectral density r X (z),
deﬁne the R-transform via the functional inverse of its Stieltjes transform WX (z)

RX (z) = W−1

X (z)−

1
z

.

(3.1)

Now assume Y is freely independent from X. Then the free (additive) convolution r X ⊞r Y
is deﬁned by r X+Y . The results of free probability theory [33] state that the latter is obtained
from r X and r Y by

1. computing RX+Y by adding the respective R-transforms,

RX+Y (z) = RX (z) + RY (z) ,

(3.2)

37

Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

2. inverting the relationship (3.1),

W −1

X+Y (z) = RX+Y (z) +

1
z

.

(3.3)

The spectral density for the sum X +Y can then be read off from the imaginary part of the

inverse function,

r X+Y (x) =

1
p Im WX+Y (x)+ .

(3.4)

We follow [81] in referring to the key relationship (3.3) as Voiculescu’s formula. Clearly
q
i=1 distributed according to (2.4) are not freely independent – their cor-
the matrices {Xi}
relations prevent us from applying Voiculescu’s formula to compute the spectral densities

for sums like X1 + X2 + . . .Xp. Our strategy to obtain the disk partition function of the

Potts model involves a suitable generalisation of the R-transform and using it to evaluate

the spectral density and hence W(p)(z).

This chapter is organised as follows: Section 3.2 reviews the matrix model formulation

and deﬁnes the observables of interest. In Section 3.3, we state the main results in Propo-

sitions 3.3.1 and 3.3.6 and discuss how our results reduce to Voiculescu’s formula when

the interactions of the Potts model are turned off. In Section 3.4, we study hard dimers,

the Ising model and the 3-states Potts model on planar triangulations as simple examples in

greater detail. We derive explicit expressions for the spectral curve for given p and compare

our results to the literature where available. In Section 3.5, we proceed to investigate the

phase diagram of the model when 0 < q < 4 and comment on the conformal ﬁeld theory

description of the scaling behaviour associated with the critical points. Finally, we discuss

the implications of our results in Section 3.6.

3.2 Deﬁnition of the model

Following [14, 20, 76, 77], we use the measure (2.4) to compute observables of the q-states

Potts model on a random planar lattice. A distinguishing feature are the exponentials of
trXiX j in (2.4), breaking the overall U (N)× O(q)-invariance of the remaining factors. Here
we conﬁne our study to the case Vi(z) = U (z) + z2/2 ∀i for a ﬁxed polynomial U (z) =
k+2
m=2 tmzm/m, rendering the q states of the statistical system indistinguishable. In this case,
the measure (2.4) remains invariant under the overall symmetries

Xi → U †XiU , U ∈ U (N) ,

and Xi → Xs (i) ,

s ∈ Sq ,

(3.5)

where Sq dentoes the symmetric group of order q!. This is to be contrasted with the “multi-

matrix chain” studied for example in [82, 83], for which Z2 is preserved in place of Sq.

Our deﬁnition includes a subset of the statistical RSOS models on a random lattice, which

are indexed by simply laced Dynkin diagrams [84] and have been described using matrix

integrals by Kostov [85]. In particular, for (q, k) = (2, 1), (2.4) describes the A3 model and

for (q, k) = (3, 1) the D4 model on random triangulations, respectively.

The desired quantities W(p)(z) can now be deﬁned along the lines of our discussion in
Subection 2.1.2 of the previous chapter: Given s ∈ Sq/(Sp× Sq−p), we deﬁne the partition

function of the model on a random lattice with p allowed, equally weighted colors on a

single connected boundary containing a marked point as1

1 ≤ p ≤ q ,

(3.6)

where here and in what follows h·i denotes the average with respect to (2.4) and z denotes
the fugacity of a boundary link. As a result of the permutation symmetry, for given p, all
p(cid:1) partition functions W(p|s )(z) are described by the same function, so
|Sq/(Sp× Sq−p)| =(cid:0)q
that we henceforth abbreviate W(p)(z) := W(p|s 0)(z) for a representative s 0 and denote the

spectral density of the sum X(p|s ) by r

(p)(z). Note that for p = 1, our deﬁnition of W(p)(z)

reduces to the one studied in [14, 20, 75, 76, 77].

We conclude this section with a helpful lemma which expresses the partition function
as single integral over effective matrix variables X0 and P± by a series of integral trans-
formations2. This circumvents a notorious difﬁculty presented by the ﬁrst factor in (2.4),

which leads to a complicated integral over the unitary group when the latter is written as a

function of the eigenvalues of the matrices Xi with i > 0 [14, 20].

Starting from (3.8c), we may use (3.9) to write the action of g + on (g ′+[e−NtrU ])p and

Performing the integration over P− and subsequently X0, we are left with (3.8a). As a
cross-check, it is straightforward to conﬁrm that (3.8a) equals our initial deﬁnition in (2.4)
of ZN,q by writing out the qth power of g ′+[e−NtrU ] as a product of integrals over Xi, i = 1 . . .q
and reversing the order of integration with P+.

3.3 Planar limit

This section is concerned with the explicit evaluation of W(p)(z) in the planar limit and is

organised as follows: Subsection 3.3.1 expresses W(p)(z) via the p-independent spectrum of
√1− e−2hP+ in (3.8a). The latter is then provided explicitly in Subsection
the matrix Y ≡
3.3.2 – a problem ﬁrst solved in [20, 82] and rederived here for arbitrary q 6= 4. Finally, in
Subsection 3.3.3, we discuss how Voiculescu’s formula (3.3) arises as a special case of our

results in the limit of vanishing interaction strength of the Potts model. To streamline the
presentation, for any pair of N × N matrices (X , P), we deﬁne the averages

3.3.1 Saddle point equations

We begin by stating the main result of this section. This rests on Lemmas 3.3.4 and 3.3.5,

which we derive from the q + 1-matrix integral (3.8c) and the pair of 1-matrix integrals

(3.8a), (3.8b) at large N, respectively. After presenting the latter, we conclude this section

with the proof of the main statement.

Proposition 3.3.1. Let the matrix P+ be deﬁned as in Lemma 3.2.1, and set Y =√1− e−2hP+.
Then for N → ¥

(3.14)

Remark 3.3.2. Generally, GY

(p)(z) is a multi-valued function so that we need to specify
the sheet on which (3.13) is evaluated. This ambiguity is ﬁxed by the condition that
limz→¥ z W(p)(z) = 1.

Corollary 3.3.3. When GY

(p)(z) satisﬁes an algebraic equation of the form F(p)(z, GY

(q−p)(z) follows from

Taking N → ¥

and using the deﬁnition (3.12) yields (3.21) as advertised.

Proof of Proposition 3.3.1 and Corollary 3.3.3. We begin by deriving the form of (3.14),

then (3.13). Firstly, the form of (3.14) follows from Lemma 3.3.5 after analytic continua-

tion: Following an argument in [75], we note that the derivative w.r.t. xN of the logarithm
of (3.23) is an entire function of xN, which implies that as N → ¥

X (z) and WX (z) have
the same discontinuity across the real axis. Applying this to our situation, we conclude that

4It is the analysis of this quantity that leads us to the exact solution for WY (z) in the next subsection.

45

(cid:229)
Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

For h > 0, it follows from (3.8a) that Y is Hermitian, so WY (z) has no singularities in

the complex plane away from the real axis. Hence we can analytically continue (3.21) to

z ∈ C\ supp r Y using

lary 3.3.3, observe that according to (3.32), for an algebraic function F in two variables,

(p)(z)(cid:17) = 0 implies F(p)(cid:16)z′ − G(q−p)

Y

(3.33)

since the analytic continuation merely takes us from one solution to the above equation to

another. Evaluating at z′ = GY

(q−p)(z) proves the corollary.

3.3.2 General solution

The main result in Proposition 3.3.1 is expressed via the functional inverse of the quantity

(3.14). Generally, this functional inversion is most easily achieved by means of an explicit
parametric form of WY (z); Proposition 3.3.6 below provides just that for general q 6= 4
when U (z) is cubic, i.e. k = 1.

f (w) holomorphic on C\ [w−, w+] satsifying the homogenous equation

2Re fsing.(w) + (2− q) fsing.(−w) = 0 , w ∈ [w−, w+] .

(3.41)

We recover r Y (z) by inverting the relationship (3.37), which, using the fact that freg.(w) is
analytic, becomes

r Y (z) =

(3.42)

From the above expressions it then follows that for z /∈ [z−, z+], WY (z) is given by

parametrisation into (3.43) completes the proof.

3.3.3 Derivation of Vouiculescu’s formula for free convolution

Here we show how our results imply a non-trivial generalisation of Voiculescu’s formula

for free convolution of probability distributions to a non-free situation. This is essentially

an adaption of the derivation in [81] to the case where the “external” matrix follows a

Gaussian distribution7; gradually turning off the O(q)-symmetry breaking interactions of

the Potts model, our formulae should reduce to Voiculescu’s for free random variables. To

conﬁrm this is the case, it is convenient to consider the slight generalisation of (2.4),

dm (X1, X2, . . .Xq) =

l NtrXiX j ×

l ≥ 0 ,

(3.45)

which reduces to (2.4) for l → 1 and should yield Voiculescu’s formula for l → 08. Then

the following holds for averages with respect to (3.45):

Proposition 3.3.7. Take N → ¥

(3.46a)

(3.46b)

where RM(z) denotes the R-transform (3.1) of WM(z).

Proof. According to Lemma 3.2.1, we can write the partition function in (3.45) via the

7Equivalent results were previously obtained by Zee in [91].
8Of course, the parameter l

is redundant in that we may equivalently obtain (2.4) by a suitable resacling

of Xi and {tm}k+2

m=2; we are thus not departing from the initial parameter space of the model.

(3.51a)

(3.51b)

On the other hand, as can be seen from (3.25) in this limit, the matrix Y will follow a

Gaussian distribution, so its spectral density approaches the semi-circle (2.14). As a result,

51

Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

the spectral density of the rescaled matrix l Y approaches a delta function so that Wl Y (z) →
1/z. Together with the relation GY

Y = id, this means that indeed

X ◦ GX

GMl Y (z)−Wl Y (z) → RM(z)

as l → 0 ,

(3.52)

from comparison with the deﬁnition (3.1). Lastly, inserting the above into (3.49) yields

(3.46b).

For q = 2, (3.46b) indeed gives Voiculescu’s formula (3.3).
It is in this sense that the
function GMl Y (z)− Wl Y (z) lifts the notion of the R-transform, so that (3.49) represents a
nontrivial extension of Voiculescu’s formula to the addition of correlated random matrices,
distributed according to (3.45). It is instructive to compare (3.49) for l = 1 to the expres-

sions in Proposition 3.3.1 of the previous section more explicitly. Since from (3.47a) and

(3.47b)

(3.54)

Hence, for the Sq-invariant case9 Vi(z)≡ U (z)−z2/2 ∀i, our main result in Proposition 3.3.1
further generalises this result to the sum of p ≤ q matrices: the function G(p)
Y (z)−WY (z)
generalises the R-transform of W(p)(z), and (3.14) generalises Voiculescu’s formula.

9The above expressions indicate that the generalisation of Proposition 3.3.1 to l

is straightforward.

3.4 Case studies

Here we consider the cases (q, k) = (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 1), which describe hard dimers,

the A3 and the D4 model on planar triangulations, respectively. For the ﬁrst two models,

the functions W(p)(z) have been known for a while [92, 23, 24] – the fact that our general

formula in Proposition (3.3.1) reproduces these results lends crecedence to our extension

to the D4-model. Unlike models with irrational values of arccos((q− 2)/2)/p , all of these

share the simpliﬁcation that they can be described by polynomial equations: We derive

explicit expressions for the polynomials F(p)(x, y) satisfying

F(p)(cid:16)z, GY

(p)(z)(cid:17) = 0 ,

1 ≤ p ≤ q ,

(3.55)

which deﬁne a family of algebraic curves C(p) = {(x, y) ∈ C2|F(p)(x, y) = 0}. In Appendix
B, we describe the resulting analytic structure of G(p)
(p)(z). The coefﬁcients in
(3.55) may be ﬁxed as follows: As stated in the introduction, herein we restrict ourselves to

Y (z) and GY

solutions for which the spectral densities have connected support, translating into a single

cut in the complex z-plane for the Stieltjes transform W(p)(z). To ensure this property, the

condition that the curve C(p) be of genus zero is sufﬁcient, though not in general necessary,
as is clear from the geometry of Riemann surfaces10. Nonetheless, we remark that this

slightly stronger condition on the solution set guarantees the existence of a (non-unique)

rational parametrisation of the curve. Requiring consistency of the latter with the deduced
asymptotic behaviour for large z in turn determines the constants c(p)
i, j
expressions for F(p)(x, y) entirely as functions of {tm}k+2
m=2.
10See also [93] for a discussion of the relationship between the connectedness of the spectral density and a

that appear in the

vanishing genus of the spectral curve.

3.4.1 (q,k) = (1,2) – Hard dimers

This model describes hard dimers on planar triangulations and was ﬁrst solved on the sphere

by Staudacher [92]. According to (2.4) and (3.8a), the partition function can be written as

both a one- and two-matrix integral,

ZN,1 =Z dX e−Ntr[U(X)−X 2/2]

=Z dY e−NtrY 2/2Z dX e−Ntr[U(X)−XY ] .

(3.56a)

(3.56b)

Using the deﬁntion (3.12) in the planar limit, the above expressions imply the following

relations:

Y (z)+ ,

z = WY (z)− + GX
U′(z) = W(1)(z)− + GY
U′(z) = W(1)(z)− +W(1)(z)+ + z ,

X (z)+ ,

(3.57b)

(3.57c)

The ﬁrst line (3.57a) is indeed consistent with (3.14) in Proposition 3.3.1 and the relations

(3.54) in Subsection 3.3.3. Via the relation GX

Figure 3.1: Integrable boundary conditions for the Ising model (q = 2) on a ﬁxed lattice
are labelled by the nodes of the graph A2 × A3; the dashed line separates two equivalent
choices of a fundamental domain.

This corresponds to the Ising model on planar triangulations, which is the A3 model in

the classiﬁcation of [84] and was ﬁrst solved on the sphere by Kazakov and Boulatov [12,

13] using the much-studied Z2-symmetric Hermitian two-matrix model. The 3 integrable

boundary conditions of this model are captured by the linear combinations of Xi shown in
Figure 3.1 [57]: W(1)(z) captures the S2 ≃ Z2-doublet {I,e }, W(2)(z) the Z2-singlet {s }.

From (3.8a), we see that in this case the partition function can be written as

ZN,2 =Z dX1dX2 e−Ntr[U(X1)+U(X2)]eNtr(X1+X2)2/2
=Z dY e−NtrY 2/2(cid:18)Z dX e−Ntr[U(X)−XY ](cid:19)2

obtain the equivalent one-matrix representation going back to [94],

,

(3.62)

where U′+(z) = t3z2/4 − z − t2(4 − t2)/(4t3) and capital Det denotes the determinant on
N2 × N2 matrices. Using the deﬁntion (3.12) in the planar limit, the above expressions
respectively imply the following set of equations:

z = WY (z)−−WY (z)+ + 2GX

U′(z) = W(1)(z)− + GY
U′(z) = W(1)(z)− + GX2

totic behaviour of GX

(3.65)

Again we may use the above to compute the analytic structure and asymptotic behaviour

that

(3.66b)

Our results reproduce the analytic structure found in [23, 24, 31] as well as the relation

between the p = 1 and p = 2 boundary conditions reported in [32]: at the level of the

polynomial equation, the correspondence with the quantities deﬁned therein is

alent choices of a fundamental domain.

3.4.3 (q,k) = (3,1) – 3-states Potts model

This model is equivalent to the D4 lattice model on planar triangulations, for which W(1)(z)

was ﬁrst calculated by Daul in [20]. The full list of boundary conditions of the D4 lattice
model is given in Figure 3.2 [74, p.60]: W(1)(z) captures the S3-triplet {I,y ,y †}, W(2)(z)
the S3-triplet {e ,s ,s †}, and W(3)(z) the singlet {F}; thanks to Corollary 3.3.3, the spec-
tral curve for the latter also deﬁnes another singlet W(0)(z), which may be conjectured to
describe the one remaing independent boundary condition {N}, though herein we will not
attempt to prove its equvialence to the microscopic deﬁnition given in [74]. From (3.8a),

we see that the partition function can be written as

ZN,3 =Z dX1dX2dX3 e−Ntr[U(X1)+U(X2)+U(X3)]eNtr(X1+X2+X2)2/2

=Z dY e−NtrY 2/2(cid:18)Z dX e−Ntr[U(X)−XY ](cid:19)3

3.5 Critical behaviour

This section discusses the critical behaviour of W(p)(z) for 0 < q < 4. The existence of

a second-order phase transition for the Potts model in this regime has been demonstrated

According to Proposition 3.3.1, it sufﬁces to determine the critical behaviour of WY (z)
for 1 > n > 0. Its possible critical exponents are determined by the multiplicity of the
singularity at the left edge z− of the spectral density r Y (z), which controls the large-order
behaviour of the generating function WY (z).

Let us begin with the case of triangulations covered in Proposition 3.3.6. Then z− = d U
is rational,

when both t2 and t3 are at their critical values t2,c, t3,c, with tm>3 = 0. When n
exact expressions for the critical lines and points can be obtained easily by requiring suf-

ﬁciently many derivatives of the polynomial (3.55) to vanish; the result is depicted for the

example (q, k) = (3, 1) in Figure 3.5. For example, from expressions (3.58), (3.64a) and

(3.72), we ﬁnd

11When q > 4, these critical points do not exist, though presumably another critical point emerges as for

the O(n) model on planar triangulations, for which g s = 1/2 when n > 2 [90, 97].

(3.80)

Let us parametrise the vicinity of this point by eliminating d U in favour of the scaling
parameter e = z− − d U and investigate the limit e → 0. We would like to expand WY (z)
in powers of e , keeping (z− z−)/e ﬁnite. Setting again w(z) = √z− d U, this requires the
expansion of f (w) in (3.43) in powers of √e ≡ w−, keeping w/√e ﬁnite. As we show in
Appendix A, equation (A.21), the terms of O(e n±n /2) in the expansion of fsing.(w) can be
written as

e n±n /2(cid:16)t(±)

n T2n±n (−w/√e ) + u(±)

n U2n±n (−w/√e )(cid:17) ,

(3.81)

where Tn (w) (resp. Un (w)) is the Chebyshev function of the ﬁrst (resp. second) kind as

deﬁned in equation (A.19). Using (A.20), the term of same order in the expansion of the

discontinuity f (w)+ − f (w)− across w/√e ∈ [1,¥ ) becomes

Comparing to (3.42) and requiring that r Y (z) → 0 as z → z− reveals that this expression
must vanish as w → ±√e , which implies that u(±)
n = 0 for all n. Using (z − z−)/e ≡
w2/e − 1 and the relation (3.43) together with

T2−n (cid:16)p1− h (cid:17) + T2−n (cid:16)−p1− h (cid:17) = 2 cos(cid:16)pn

gives the following expansion of WY (z):

ﬁndings [20, 75, 77], namely

g s =

.

(3.86)

In particular, g s = −1/2, −1/3, −1/5 and 0 for q = 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, which

is consistent with Liouville theory interacting with conformal matter of central charges

cM = 0, 1/2, 4/5 and 1 according to (2.34). Whilst in the ﬁrst two cases the conformal ﬁeld

theory is unique, there exist two distinct modular invariants at cM = 4/5, corresponding to

the (A4, A5) Virasoro minimal model and the (A4, D4) minimal model, which admits a

conserved spin-3 current is diagonal under the extended W3-algebra [48, 50]. In light of

the S3-symmetry of the partition function (3.69a) and the resulting spectrum of boundary

conditions [25] – cf. Figure 3.2 – we expect our equations to describe the latter coupled to

Liouville theory, not the former.

3.6 Discussion

Let us summarise our results. Starting from the matrix integral representation of the Potts

model on a random lattice in Lemma 3.2.1, we employed the saddle point apprixomation

64

Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

to express W(p)(z) via the p-independent average WY (z) in Proposition 3.3.1. For the case

of planar triangulations, Proposition 3.3.6 provides an explicit elliptic parametrisation of
the latter for arbitrary q 6= 4. Just as equation (3.8a) deﬁnes an analytic continuation of the
partition function to the complex q-plane, equation (3.14) may thus be used to deﬁne the an-

alytic continuation of W(p)(z) in the complex p- and q-plane. What is more, Corollary 3.3.3
showed that W(p)(z) and W(q−p)(z) can be related algebraically – in the case studies in Sec-
tion 3.4, this resulted in the p- and (q− p)-boundary conditions being described by a single
spectral curve deﬁned by the zero locus of (3.55). Remarkably, equations (3.66a), (3.75a)
(q−p)(z)− z are functional inverses, generalis-
ing the well-known duality12 interchanging the two matrices of the symmetric Hermitian

and (3.75b) indicate that GY

(p)(z)− z and GY

two-matrix model [68, 69].

Our results naturally pave the way for a number of further developments: Firstly, going

beyond the planar limit, as was done in [99] for the O(n) model on random lattices, it

would be interesting to explore if and when the curves deﬁned by (3.55) can be used as a

valid part of the initial data of the topological recursion algorithm [66], which allows to

compute averages to all orders in 1/N. Secondly, for general values of h in Lemma 3.2.1,

the remarkably simple result in Lemma 3.3.4 should enable us to investigate the boundary

renormalisation group ﬂow relating boundary conditions with different p. This ﬂow is

expected to induce a partial order on the spectrum of boundary states in accordance with

the boundary analogue of the c-theorem [100], as conjectured in [101] and ﬁnally proven

by Friedan and Konechny [102]; it would be interesting to derive this fact directly from the

matrix model, thus extending the work of [23, 24, 32].

Finally, it would be instructive to check if the universal results of Section 3.5 can be re-

produced by other means, e.g. by explicitly constructing the corresponding conformal ﬁeld

theory. Remarkably, as exempliﬁed by the case of the D4 model, this appears to require a

12Note that this involution is in general distinct from the Kramers-Wannier duality [98] on the dynamical
lattice: e.g. for q = 3, the latter interchanges p = 1 with p = 3, and p = 2 with p = 0, mixing singlets and
triplets [25].

65

Chapter3. SumsofRandomMatricesandthePottsModelonPlanarMaps

non-diagonal partition function in the Liouville sector in general. From this perspective,

various other corners of the (q, k)-parameter space also warrant more detailed investiga-

tions. Of particular interest would be the computation of the scaling behaviour for strongly

coupled models with q > 4: one might wonder if there exist analogues of the critical points

of the O(n) model on a random lattice with n > 2 reported in [90, 97]. For the models
with q = 52 − 6n for n ∈ {1, 2, 3} in the inﬁnite k limit, cM = 18, 12 and 6, respectively,
and Liouville theory allows a truncation to a tachyon-free spectrum [103, 104]; the matrix

model might help in reconciling the conﬂicting CFT predictions [105] and [106]. Finally,

it might be of interest to enquire about the existence of the ‘t Hooft limit q → ¥
q/(q + k) ﬁxed, which has been studied for the pure Wq minimal models in [107].

The Critical Potts Model Coupled to

Liouville Theory

4.1 Overview

In this chapter, we investigate the spectrum of the Wq conformal minimal models coupled

to gravity in two dimensions. We shall consider the theory on the sphere and the disk.

Requiring the overall conformal anomaly to vanish allows for the interpretation of these

theories as a family of bosonic string backgrounds. A new feature with respect to the so-

called minimal string (i.e., a Virasoro minimal model coupled to Liouville theory) is the

presence of conversed currents with integer spins up to q on the worldsheet which – with the

exception of the stress-energy tensor – remain ungauged. The matter sector consequently

enjoys an extended non-linear symmetry admitting additional globally conserved charges

given by the generators of the so-called Wq algebra. A major motivation for invoking the

latter is that it can be understood as a continuous extension of a discrete symmetry arising

from the continuum limit of a critical statistical model on a random lattice. In particular,
when q ≤ 4, such theories are expected to provide a description of the scaling limit of
the Potts model on a random planar lattice with discrete symmetry group Sq. Unlike two-

67

Chapter4. TheCriticalPottsModelCoupledtoLiouvilleTheory

dimensional W -gravity, which is obtained from these systems by coupling the remaining

currents to higher-spin gauge ﬁelds, and for which the critical target space dimension in-

creases with q [46], the former enter a strong-coupling regime with tachyonic instabilities

when the central charge of the minimal model exceeds one.

The unitary Wq CFTs also provide a dual description of three-dimensional spin-q grav-

ity coupled to scalar matter, with Newton coupling GN = 3
2ℓcM, where cM denotes the
central charge (2.42) of the minimal model and −1/ℓ2 is the cosmological constant: for
example, the torus partition function of the CFT equals the semiclassical partition function

of the gravity theory in thermal Anti-de Sitter space with radius ℓ [107]. The perturbative
excitations of the latter are described by Chern-Simons theory with an sl(q, R)⊕ sl(q, R)-
valued connection; coupling the boundary CFT to Liouville theory such that the overall

conformal anomaly vanishes corresponds to switching from Dirichlet to Neumann bound-

ary conditions for the metric on the boundary of AdS [108]. In this way, our computations

also solve a problem in three-dimensional spin-q gravity with negative cosmological con-

stant, with the boundary metric allowed to ﬂuctuate but the asymptotic behaviour of the
higher spin gauge ﬁelds held ﬁxed. The presence of tachyonic excitations for cM ≥ 1 indi-
cates the perturbative instability of the boundary condition for large enough GN/ℓ.

This chapter is organised at follows: After determining the spectrum of theory on the

sphere in Section 4.2 from the cohomology of the BRST operator associated with the dif-

feomorphism symmetry, we proceed to introduce a family of conformally invariant bound-

ary conditions from the tensor product of the Liouville and minimal model boundary states

Section 4.3. We present evidence that upon analytic continuation of the boundary cos-

mological constant, this construction in fact overcounts the number of distinct boundary

conditions, as has previously been observed for the minimal string in [29]. Lastly, a sum-

mary and discussion of our results is provided in Section 4.4.

68

Chapter4. TheCriticalPottsModelCoupledtoLiouvilleTheory

4.2 Bulk states

Here we discuss the spectrum of physical states on CP1. For q = 2, our results reduce to

those for the Virasoro minimal models coupled to gravity, for which the spectrum was ﬁrst

determined in [17, 109]. These results were rederived in [36] in a more elementary free

ﬁeld formalism and our approach will be close in spirit.

The reparametrisation invariance requires the sum cM + cL + cgh to vanish, which ac-

cording to (2.42) and (2.55) gives a condition on the background charges, ﬁxing the Liou-

ville coupling b for given q, p and p′:

bility exponent g s = 1−b±2 then follows from (2.34). For later comparison with the matrix
model with cubic potential, we print this relationship for the simplest model with k = 1 in
(2.47), i.e. p′ − p = p− q = 1:

M = Q2

(4.2)

The above formula produces the values g s = −1/2, −1/3,−1/5 and 0 for q = 1, 2, 3 and

4, respectively if we pick the negative branch of the square root such that the weak cou-
pling regime 2/3 ≤ b2 ≤ 1 corresponds to 1 ≤ q ≤ 41; the strong-weak duality b → 1/b
permutes these two branches. When (4.1) holds, the BRST charge d deﬁned in (2.35) be-

comes nilpotent and denoting the irreducible Wq-module with conformal dimension (2.45)
by M (l ), we deﬁne the holomorphic part of the physical Hilbert space of the Wq minimal
model coupled to gravity as

(4.3)

where FL(P) and Fgh are deﬁned in (2.58) and (2.64), respectively and Hn denotes the

subspace of Ker d/Im d with ghost number n. In what follows, we shall argue that for a
suitable choice of the fundamental domain B(q)

p,p′, the following result holds:

Proposition 4.2.1. Let the complex C ⊥(l ) be deﬁned as

Then for any l ∈ B(q)
p,p′,

Hn(cid:0)M (l )⊗ FL(P)⊗ Fgh, d(cid:1) ≃ Hn(cid:16)C ⊥(l ), d′(cid:17) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

The Fock space of transverse oscillations F ⊥(P,l ) in the above is deﬁned in (4.11) and l w
is as in (2.49). In particular, the highest-weight states created by the ‘tachyon’ operators

Tl (z) = c(z)V L

are always contained in the cohomology of d′. When P2

normalisable and the sign of the square root can be ﬁxed by the Seiberg bound iP > 0. To

where l = r

labels the dressed identity ﬁeld, for which

(4.7)

Hence, “macroscopic” states with ﬁnite real P are absent from the spectrum only for cM ≤
1, signalling the well-known Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of Liouville theory at cL = 25.

70

Chapter4. TheCriticalPottsModelCoupledtoLiouvilleTheory

When cM > 1, we expect the complex values of g s yielded by (4.2) – and, more generally,
the KPZ relations – to be unreliable.

The result (4.5) follows from an application of the following useful result on doubly

graded complexes:

Lemma 4.2.2 ([110, 111]). Let d and d′ be commuting, nilpotent differentials on a complex
C and suppose Hn(C , d) = 0 for n 6= 0 and Hn(C , d′) = 0 for n 6= 0. Then

Hn(cid:0)H0(C , d′), d(cid:1) ≃ Hn(cid:0)H0(C , d), d′(cid:1) .

(4.8)

The remainder of this section is devoted to demonstrating that in the case at hand, the

conditions in the above lemma are indeed satisﬁed. To this end, we introduce the complex

C (P,l ) = MNi∈ZMw∈Sq

F (P,l w− pp′Niei) ,

l ∈ B(q)
p,p′ ,

(4.9)

where we deﬁned an extended Fock space from the tensor product of (2.48), (2.58) and

(2.64),

F (P,l ) = FM(l )⊗ FL(P)⊗ Fgh .

(4.10)

Firstly, on this complex, we must have d2 = (d′)2 = 0 and also [d, d′] = 0, since d′ acts
nontrivially only on FM(l ) and [d′, LM
0 ] = 0 by construction. Secondly, recall from the
introduction in Subsection 2.2.2 that Hn(C (P,l ), d′) = 0 for n 6= 0 is already implied in
the free-ﬁeld resolution of M (l ) along the lines of [53, 111, 52]. To show applicability of
Lemma 4.2.2, it thus remains to characterise Hn(F (P,l ), d). The result is
Lemma 4.2.3. Pick a basis in root space such that r = (|r |, 0, . . ., 0), and let

commutes with d so that we may restrict our attention to the subspace

Frel(P,l ) = F (P,l )∩ Ker L0 ∩ Ker b0

and determine the so-called relative cohomology of the restriction drel of d to this subspace,

which is [36]

drel = d + b0 (cid:229)

is given by

Hn (F (P,l ), d) = Hn (Frel(P,l ), drel)⊕ c0Hn−1 (Frel(P,l ), drel) .

We observe that dk+ is in fact nilpotent on the extended Fock space and (anti-)commutes
with both b0 and the total energy. We can therefore determine the cohomology dk+ on F
ﬁrst and thereafter restrict to Frel. The procedure to determine the cohomology of dk+ on
F is analogous to that for the critical bosonic string: We distinguish the cases

1. Either p+

n |l iM ⊗|PiL 6= 0 or p−n |l iM ⊗|PiL 6= 0 ∀ n ∈ Z\{0},

2. Otherwise, i.e. p±n±|l iM ⊗|PiL = 0 for a pair of non-zero integers (n+, n−).

(4.23)

where F ⊥(P,l ) is given by (4.11). Finally, we need to restrict to the subspace Frel by

choose a resolution of M (l ) = H0(C (el ), d′) for which (4.25) is never satisﬁed. On the

latter, the operator (4.21) is well deﬁned, thus yielding the same result as in the previous

case.

Remark 4.2.4. It is instructive to see how the known results for the Virasoro minimal model

coupled to gravity are recovered from the above results when q = 2: then the Liouville
coupling satisﬁes b2 = p/p′ and we obtain the particularly simple relationship g s = 1− p′/p
since cM ≤ 1. The Fock module of transverse oscillations F ⊥(l ) reduces to C, with
|l iM ⊗|Pl i ⊗|0igh the only state. Introducing the Kac labels 1 ≤ r < p, 1 ≤ s < p′ by
setting e1 · l w = p′wr− ps, we ﬁnd that the transverse complex (4.4) becomes
span(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:12)l w − N pp′e1; Pl w−N pp′e1(cid:11)(cid:9) ,

The physical states are then given by the cohomology of d′ on C ⊥(r, s), which is exactly

the procedure ﬁrst used in [36] to determine the spectrum; hence we recover the familiar

result of Lian and Zuckerman [17] for the physical states of the Virasoro minimal model

coupled to gravity.

3For q = 2, this simply corresponds to the reﬂection symmetry of the Kac table.

4.3 Boundary states

Using the operator-state correspondence and modular invariance, we associate to each con-
formal boundary condition a “boundary state” in the of Ln − ¯L−n of the physical Hilbert
space; identities in this section are therefore implied to hold modulo BRST exact terms.

Because the Virasoro algebra acts diagonally on the tensor factors in (4.10), conformal in-

variance has to be preserved in each sector independently. Our ansatz for a conformally

invariant boundary state, given l ∈ B(q)

p,p′, is thus the tensor product of (2.67), (2.75) and

(2.77),

|s il = |l iC ⊗|s iFZZT⊗|Bigh .

(4.28)

We now present some evidence that the above deﬁnition actually overcounts the number

of independent boundary conditions if we analytically continue the boundary cosmological

constant (2.73), as was observed in the case q = 2 in [29]. Consider the one-point function
of a tachyon operator (4.6) on the upper half plane with matter boundary condition |s il

on the real line,

hTl il

′(s ) = lim
z,¯z→¥

h0|Tl (z) ¯T¯l (¯z)|s il

In particular, the one-point function of the dressed identity computes the ﬁrst derivative of
the partition function on the disk with boundary condition l ,

the s -dependence of disc one-point functions: Setting l = r

matter conﬁgurations on the boundary. Note that in general, not all the above equations are

independent.

Remark 4.3.1. Once again, it is instructive to consider how our results reduce to those for

the Virasoro minimal model coupled to gravity upon setting q = 2. The root space of SU (2)

is one-dimensional, and the Weyl character formula yields a sum over bsu(2)k ×bsu(2)k+1
representation weights. Explicitly, let the Kac indices (r, s) and (k, l) be deﬁned by e1·l =

where we increment m and n in steps of 2. Hence we conclude that all boundary states can

be replaced with superpositions of the identity Cardy state, in agreement with [29, 112].

Consider (4.46) for (r, s) = (1, 2) and (2, 1), respectively: these imply that as a function

of the variables z and h deﬁned by the relations (2.72) and (2.73), hT1,1i satisﬁes

(4.49)

which is the same equation as (2.101) arising at the critical point of the Hermitian two-

matrix matrix model, the solutions to which are studied in the second part of Appendix

A.

4.4 Discussion

Let us summarise the results of this chapter: in Section 4.2, we determined the the spectrum

of physical states on the sphere using a generalisation of the free-ﬁeld formalism used in

[52, 105]. Our main result as summarised in Proposition 4.2.1 demonstrated the absence

of states that would arise in the cohomology of the usual bosonic string – i.e. free bosons

coupled to gravity – thanks to the symmetries of the model. Nevertheless, the cohomology

includes operators that create boundaries in the worldsheet when the central charge of the

minimal model exceeds one, signalling the expected Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of Li-

ouville theory. Another notable feature that distinguishes the spectrum of the model from

that of the minimal string is that though no state can carry overall spin, when q > 2, the

full Hilbert space does include states with non-zero spins in both the matter and the Liou-

ville sector, a phenomenon which resembles the “deconﬁnement of chirality” described in

[103, 106].

We then introduced a family of conformally invariant boundary conditions (4.28) in

Section 4.3, parametrised by the primary ﬁelds l ∈ B(q)

p,p′ of the Wq minimal model and
the cosmological constant on the boundary. The relation (4.44) following from the sub-

sequent analysis of the one-point function of tachyon operators (4.6) revealed that on the
disk, we can replace any boundary state with a sum over boundary states with l = r and

complex values of the boundary cosmological constant, lending evidence to the fact that

81

Chapter4. TheCriticalPottsModelCoupledtoLiouvilleTheory

the tensor product (4.28) overcounts physically distinct boundary conditions. This gener-

alises the observation made in [29] for the minimal string, to which our results reduce for

q = 2. Moreover, in conjunction with the factorisation of matter and Liouville contribu-

tions, this provided an immediate derivation of a series of functional difference equations

(4.46) obeyed by the tachyon one-point functions.

Our results are also of relevance to the holographic description of higher-spin gravity

with negative cosmological constant alluded to in the introduction. In particular, the CFT

on the disk D deﬁnes the holographic dual of a 3-manifold M3 with ¶ M3 = D∪M2, where
¶ D = ¶ M2 [113]. Notably, this construction has been invoked in [114] for a proposal of
local observables on M3. Unlike [113], where the usual Dirichlet boundary condition is

imposed on the metric on D, here we impose Neumann boundary conditions on both D and

M2. An important consequence of this modiﬁcation is the emergence of the relation (4.44),

rendering boundary conditions corresponding to excited matter states semiclassically in-

distinguishable from a quantum superposition of boundary conditions corresponding to the

matter ground state.

A central question raised by this analysis is whether the degeneracy implied by (4.44)

persists in more complicated amplitudes and thus holds on the entire physical Hilbert space,

as conjectured for q = 2 in [29] and subsequently challenged in [31, 32]: Here we have

only considered one-point functions of tachyons on the disk; to see if the identiﬁcation of

boundary states holds generally on the Hilbert space requires more work. This leads us

to the investigation in the following chapter: there we will consider the case q = 2 and

show how this degeneracy is lifted upon inclusion of ‘inﬁnite-genus’ worldsheets, or more

precisely, effects contributing non-perturbatively in the string coupling constant.

82

Chapter 5

Wronskians, Duality and Cardy Branes

5.1 Overview

Here we consider the double scaling limit of the ensemble (2.4) with q = 2, where V1 and

V2 are polynomials of degree p and p′ respectively. As discussed in the introduction, Sec-

tion 2.2, the universality classes of the critical points in the phase diagram spanned by the

coefﬁcients of V1 and V2 are labelled by pairs (p, p′) of coprime integers and are described

by Liouville theory coupled to a Virasoro minimal model [19, 115, 18].

In Subsection

2.2.2, we saw that the conformally invariant boundary states of Liouville theory fall into

two classes: the discrete set of Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (ZZ) [28] branes, and the

Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov-Teschner [26, 28, 56] (FZZT) brane |s iFZZT de-
ﬁned in (2.75). Their tensor product with the Cardy boundary states |r, siC of the minimal
model yields the complete brane spectrum of the theory. As Seiberg and Shih pointed out
[29], the resulting set of (p− 1)(p′ − 1)/2 distinct FZZT branes – one per primary ﬁeld of
the minimal model – appears to be at odds with the merely two obvious boundary condi-

tions that can be imposed in the matrix model description, corresponding to the resolvents

of the matrices X1 and X2, which compute the partition function of a worldsheet with a

single connected boundary. The solution to this paradox put forward in [29] is based on the

83

Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

conjecture that all boundary states can be written as superpositions of a single boundary

state with analytically continued values of the boundary cosmological constant (2.73):

|s iFZZT⊗|r, siC =

r−1

m=−(r−1)

s−1

n=−(s−1)|s + im/b + inbiFZZT⊗|1, 1iC .

(5.1)

In the above, b2 = p/p′ and we increment m and n in steps of 2.

Indeed, the relation

(4.48) for the one-point functions on the disk derived in the previous chapter is consistent

with this proposal; see also [112, 116, 117, 118, 119] for an extensive amount of evidence.

It was hence concluded that the resolvents of the matrices X1 and X2 sufﬁce to capture

all boundary conditions and there is no contradiction. Later, the X1 + X2-resolvent was

computed directly from the matrix model in [31, 32] for the unitary (p, p + 1) series of
critical points and found to describe the (r, s) = (1, p− 1) boundary condition, where the
validity of (5.1) was challenged for worldsheets of non-planar topology. However, the lack

of an independent construction of the complete brane spectrum in the matrix model has

until now obstructed attempts at a satisfactory solution of these debates.

Here we point out that generally, the analytic continuation of an asymptotic expansion

need not coincide with the asymptotic expansion of the analytically continued function,

which is the well-known Stokes’ phenomenon [120, 121], and we are led to wonder about

the fate of this observation beyond perturbation theory in the string coupling gs. Indeed, in

the operator formalism, the non-perturbative differential equations (2.91) and (2.92) allow

complete sets of p and p′ independent solutions for the Baker-Akhiezer functions, respec-

tively, only one of which describes the double-scaling limit of the expectation value of the

resolvent of X1 resp. X2. It was later discovered that the remaining independent solutions in

fact provide a consistent set of boundary conditions for normal matrices with eigenvalues

supported on appropriate arcs away from the real axis [122, 123], suggesting their relevance

for Stokes’ phenomenon displayed by the resolvent operator. This motivates our study of

the Wronskian for the non-perturbative linear differential equations (2.91) and (2.92). The

84

(cid:229)
(cid:229)
Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

main purpose of this investigation is to answer the questions

1. What differential equations does the Wronskian satisfy?

2. Which new observables are captured by the Wronskian?

The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows: In Section 5.2, we will detail the rea-

soning for considering the Wronskian associated with the system of differential equations

(2.91). Employing a mild generalisation thereof1 dating back to Schmidt [128], we subse-

quently answer the ﬁrst question. We then use the results to turn to the second question,

providing evidence for the conjecture that the set of independent Wronskians is organised

in a Kac table whose entries are in one-to-one correspondence with the primary ﬁelds of the

minimal model. In Section 5.3, we then show how this table reproduces the relation (5.1)

in the semiclassical limit. Together, these observations strongly suggest that the Wronskian
provides a non-perturbative description of the general FZZT brane with (r, s) 6= (1, 1), and
that the degeneracy (5.1) is resolved by additional degrees of freedom whose independence

is invisible in perturbation theory in gs. We close with a discussion of results and possible

further developments in Section 5.4.

5.2 Generalised Wronskian

This section proceeds as follows: In Subsection 5.2.1, we explain how the relation (5.1)

hints at the Wronskian associated with the linear differential equation for the Baker-Akhiezer

function. In Subsection 5.2.2, we derive the analogues of (2.91) and (2.92), allowing us to

introduce an isomonodromy system akin to (2.99a), each of which deﬁnes a spectral curve.
In Subsection 5.2.3, we use the properties of the duality transformation (p, p′) → (p′, p)
to determine the complete set of observables deﬁned by the Wronskian; the fact that a

Kac table for the latter emerges directly from the matrix model without reference to the

1see also [124, 125, 126, 127] for recent work.

85

Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

worldsheet conformal ﬁeld theory provides the ﬁrst piece of evidence that our construc-

tion provides a non-perturbative description of the FZZT branes with general Cardy labels
(r, s) 6= (1, 1), which we will refer to as Cardy branes for short.

5.2.1 Wronskians and Cardy branes

Recall from the introduction that the single-trace operator tr(x− X ) creates a connected
boundary in the worldsheet corresponding to the state |s iFZZT ⊗|1, 1iC, and the determi-
nant operator det(x− X ) creates the associated brane at target space position x. From the
expansion (2.82), it can be seen that a linear combination of such boundary states as in

(5.1) indicates that the matrix model operator corresponding to the general Cardy brane

|s iFZZT ⊗ |r, siC factorises into a product of more elementary operators. Indeed, such a

relation is expected from Polchinski’s general combinatorial picture applied to the present

context [45, 129]. It was proven by Morozov in [65] that the average of a general product

of characteristic polynomials

To proceed, we make the further observation that the translations s → s + im/b + inb

in (5.1) move between sheets of the spectral curve deﬁned by the zero locus of the semiclas-

sical limit of the polynomials (2.100a) – a fact which has been widely discussed, including

[112, 116, 117, 118, 119]. This semiclassical spectral curve provides the initial data for

the topological recursion algorithm described in [66], which computes the asymptotic ex-

pansion of arbitrary correlation function to any ﬁnite order in gs – it thus appears that to
all orders in the perturbative expansion, all p branches {y ( j)(t;z )}p
j=1 of the solution can
indeed be obtained from a single principal branch y (1)(t;z ) by mere analytic continuation
z → e2p iz . This indicates that by performing the asymptotic expansion, we lose the in-

formation required to distinguish one solution from the other. We therefore generalise the

expression (5.4) to account for the complete set of independent solutions {y ( j)(t;z )}p
resp. {c ( j)(t;z )}p′

j=1 to (2.91) resp. (2.92),

(5.5)

We may regard the above as the antisymmetrised ground state wave function of M coin-

cident branes and their duals. Notably, due to the fermionic statistics, the existence of

such “brane stacks” requires the presence of an additional quantum number – the label j

distinguishing the independent solutions.

5.2.2 Differential equations and spectral curve

Here we derive the differential equations satisﬁed by the observables (5.5). We also intro-

duce the corresponding spectral curves and deﬁne an extension of the charge conjugation,

which will turn out useful when we consider the duality transformation (2.97) in the next
∅ (t;z ) with respect to
subsection. To this end, we need to keep track of derivatives of W (n)

Deﬁnition 5.2.1. Denote the set of Young diagrams with n rows by L n and the subset of

n(cid:1) diagrams with at most p− n boxes in each row by L p,n; denote the number of boxes in

(5.15)

Whenever n a > p− n for some a on the right-hand side, we apply Proposition 5.2.4 repeat-
edly to obtain a linear combination of Sl with l ∈ L p,n. Since Mp,n is an abelian group
under addition, it is an Rn-module.

We now look for a suitable generalisation of the isomonodromy description (2.99a) and the
spectral curve (2.100a). To this end, one ﬁrst chooses an ordering on L p,n, for example

(5.16)

We then have the following result:

Proposition 5.2.6. Let ~W (n)(t;z ) = (W (n)

dered according to (5.16). Then there exist(cid:0)p

such that

¶ t ~W (n)(t;z ) = B(n)(t;z )~W (n)(t;z ) ,
¶ z ~W (n)(t;z ) = Q(n)(t;z )~W (n)(t;z ) .

(5.17a)

(5.17b)

Proof. Since ¶ t = S (¶ ), we can use Corollary 5.2.5 to ﬁnd B(n):

To show the existence of Q(n), we use ﬁrst use (5.9b) to expand the right hand side in Schur

polynomials and thereafter apply Corollary 5.2.5.

Deﬁnition 5.2.7. We introduce the characteristic polynomials

(5.18)

Observe that for given n, the spectral curves for C (n)

degree. To pave the way for a deﬁnition of the duality transformation, it is useful to relate

these two systems by extending the deﬁnition of the charge conjugation (2.94) as follows:

For given l ∈ L p,n, we deﬁne complement l ⊥ and conjugate l ∨ via

l ⊥a = (p− n)− l n−a+1 ,
l ∨a = max1≤b≤r {b|l r−b+1 ≥ a} ,

a = 1, . . .n

a = 1, . . . p− n

(5.20a)

(5.20b)

and make the following

Deﬁnition 5.2.8. We deﬁne the charge conjugation

C : Mp,n −→ Mp,p−n ,
7−→ C [W (n)

W (n)

l

] = W (p−n)
C (l )

l

,

(5.21)

where C (l ) = (−1)|l |(l ⊥)∨.

We close this subsection with a few examples illustrating the above construction; to facili-

tate the presentation, we relegate the explicit equations for the Lax operators to Appendix C.

These immediately determine the full non-perturbative spectral curve via Deﬁnition 5.2.7.
Below, we print the corresponding polynomials (5.18) in the semiclassical limit gs → 0.
For later comparison with the conformal ﬁeld theory prediction (5.1), we evaluate this limit

in the conformal background, in which (2.101) holds.

Example 5.2.9. (p, p′) = (3, 2). The only allowed cases n = 1, 2 are equivalent to the 3×3

5.2.3 Kac table and duality

In this section, we provide evidence that the set of differential equations that characterise

the generalised Wronskians for given (p, p′) fall into a Kac table whose entries are in

94

Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

one-to-one correspondence with the (p − 1)(p′ − 1)/2 Cardy states of the (Ap−1, Ap′−1)
minimal model. To keep track of which Baker-Akhiezer function we take the Wronskian

of, we reﬁne our notation as follows:

W (n)

l

[ f ](·) = det

1≤a,b≤n(cid:16)¶ n−a+l n+a−1

t

f ( jb)(t;·)(cid:17) .

(5.30)

l

in W (n)

Moreover, because we are only interested in relations between entire modules {Mp,n}p
whose elements satisfy the same differential equations, we shall at times omit the subscript
l

. Our derivation is based on the property of the Virasoro minimal model that
the duality transformation (2.97) takes the boundary state |r, siC of the (p, p′) model to the
equivalent state |s, riC of the (p′, p) model: Under the assumption that the composition
of the Laplace transform (2.96) with the charge conjugation (5.21) extends this duality

n=1

transformation non-perturbatively, we can ﬁll the entries on the boundary of the Kac table

shown to the left of Figure 5.1 via

(r,1)(z ) = W (r)[y ](z ) ,
(1,s)(z ) = L W (p′−s)[c ](z ) ,

(r,p′−1)(z ) = W (r) [L c ] (z ) ,
(p−1,s)(z ) = L W (p′−s)[L y ](z ) .

(5.31)

Introducing the dual wave functions eY

to the right of Figure 5.1 in the analogous manner:

tries on the boundary of the image of the Kac table under the duality transformation shown

(s,r)(h ) = L C [Y

(r,s)](h ), we can complete the en-

(1,r)(h ) = L W (p−r)[y ](h ) ,
(s,1)(h ) = W (s)[c ](h ) ,

(p′−1,r)(h ) = L W (p−r)[L c ](h ) ,
(s,p−1)(h ) = W (s) [L y ] (h ) .

(5.32)

Let us discuss some evidence in favour of this proposal. Firstly, note that our extension of
the duality transformation C ◦ L evidently preserves the string equation (2.90) and hence

the bulk physics. Secondly, since W (r)[y ] and W (s)[c ] are constant for r ≥ p resp. s ≥ p′,

the corresponding differential equations are trivial and the table in Figure 5.1 is bounded in
the appropriate way. Thirdly, since the (p− 1)th-degree Wronskian for a linear differential
equation of order p satisﬁes the transpose of the originial differential equation, we deduce

from the deﬁnition of the charge conjugation (5.21) that

L C [c ](z ) = L W (p′−1)[c ](h ) = y (z ) ,
L C [y ](h ) = L W (p−1)[y ](h ) = c (h ) ,

(5.33)

where equality means that the corresponding modules are characterised by the same differ-

ential equations; such a relation has also been pointed in [131]. In the same way, it follows

that

C [L c ](z ) = W (p−1)[L c ](z ) = y (−z ) ,
C [L y ](h ) = W (p′−1)[L y ](h ) = c (−h ) .

(5.34)

These relations prove the consistency of our proposal at the corner entries of the table.

Lastly, a consistency check for other entries on the boundary of the table is provided by a

comparison of the spectral curves: after performing a Laplace transform (2.96) and charge

96

Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

conjugation (5.21) on (5.17), we obtain a new isomondromy system of different size, with

operators eB(n)(t;h ) and eQ(n)(t;h ), where now 0 < n < p′. If this system is to provide a

dual description of the same brane, we expect the zero locus of their characteristic polyno-

mial to deﬁne the same spectral curve, i.e.

Below we provide a check of the above relation for a few simple examples.

Taking the semiclassical limit and evaluating in the conformal background, the spectral

is indeed satisﬁed.

5.3 Semiclassical limit

In the previous section, we saw that the generalised Wronskians allow us to deﬁne a set of

averages involving independent degrees of freedom that are in one-to-one correspondence

with the entries on the boundary of the Kac table. Here we study how this table reproduces
the relation (5.1) in the semiclassical limit gs → 0, providing another piece of evidence in
favour of our deﬁnition in Section 5.2.3. Inspection of (2.101) reveals that in the conformal
background, the p solutions to limgs→0 G(1)(t;z , Q) = 0 can be parametrised as z (t ) =
cosh(pt ) and Q = Q( j)(t ), where

Q( j)(t ) = cosh[p′(t − 2p i( j− 1)/p)] ,

1 ≤ j ≤ p .

on the fundamental domain {( j1, j2, . . . jn) | 1 ≤ j1 < j2 < ··· < jn ≤ p}. This is to be
compared with the relation (5.1), which involves the following analytic continuations of
z and h :

z l,k = cosh(cid:2)p(t + ip l/p′ + ip k/p)(cid:3) ,
h k,l = cosh(cid:2)p′(t + ip l/p′ + ip k/p)(cid:3) .

where m and n are incremented in steps of 2, we conclude that the product of the above two

quantities can be written as

dr,s =

S(r,s)(1,1)
S(1,1)(1,1)

.

(5.45)

The numbers dr,s are sometimes called the quantum dimension of the state (r, s); The deﬁ-

nition of Cardy states (2.67) gave rise to the interpretation of these numbers as ground state

degeneracies, and their logarithm as “boundary entropies” – see also the end of Section 4.3

(cid:229)
(cid:229)
Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

of the previous chapter. From the latter, it is evident that the branch jk = k− (n + 1)/2 mod
p gives a description of the (r, s) = (1, n) Cardy brane consistent with the conformal ﬁeld

theory prediction (5.1) when evaluated in the conformal background2, since

Q( j1, j2,... jn)(t ) = d1,nQ(0)(t ) .

(5.46)

However, because the isomonodromy system (5.17) and (5.17) has size(cid:0)p

curve will in general contain other factors besides the above branch. For (r, s) = (1, 2), this

n(cid:1), the spectral

can be seen in the Examples 5.2.10 and 5.2.11, where the spectral curve factorises as

(p, p′) = (4, 3) : G(2)

(p, p′) = (5, 2) : G(2)

We close this section by demonstrating that this observation generalises to arbitrary (p, p′)

according to the following

Proposition 5.3.1. Let Tp(cosht ) = cosh(pt ) denote the pth Chebyshev polynomial of the
ﬁrst kind. Then up to normalisation, the semiclassical curve for n = 2 can be written as

j1, we ﬁnd

Q( j1, j2)(t ) = 2 cos(2p p′a/p)Q( j1+a)(t ) ,

2This result is also consistent with the relation (4.48) derived in the previous chapter.

which is the solution to

(5.50)

We can now distinguish the following two cases:

1. When p is odd, we may choose 1 ≤ j1 ≤ p, 1 ≤ a ≤ (p − 1)/2 as a fundamental

domain, giving the ﬁrst line in (5.48).

2. When p is even, we may choose 1 ≤ j1 ≤ p, 1 ≤ a ≤ (p− 2)/2, together with 1 ≤
j1 ≤ p/2 for a = p/2 as a fundamental domain. Since p′ is odd, Q( j1, j2)(t ) = 0 for
a = p/2, giving the factor Qp/2 in the second line of (5.48). For 1 ≤ a ≤ (p− 2)/2,
Q( j1, j2)(t ) again solves (5.50), giving the remainder of the second line in (5.48).

5.4 Discussion

Let us summarise our results. In Section 5.2, we ﬁrst motivated our deﬁnition of the Wron-

skian (5.6) to describe the independent degrees of freedom arising in the non-perturbative

description outlined in the introduction, Subsection 2.3. We then derived the non-perturbative

differential equations satisﬁed by the latter in Proposition 5.2.4. The construction of the

isomonodromy system using Proposition 5.2.6 consequently allowed for the construction

of the spectral curves according to Deﬁnition 5.2.7. A Kac table of independent branes

with entries in one-to-one correspondence with the primary ﬁelds of the minimal model

then emerged naturally from the properties of the Wronskian in conjunction with the du-

ality transformation (2.97). Finally, in Section 5.3, we then showed how the semiclassical
limit gs → 0 of the Wronskian includes a branch consistent with the degeneracy (5.1) pre-
dicted by conformal ﬁeld theory. Altogether, these results provide ample evidence that due
to Stokes’ phenomenon, the non-perturbative the general Cardy brane with (r, s) 6= (1, 1)
101

Chapter5. Wronskians,DualityandCardyBranes

can not be described by analytic continuation of a single principal solution (r, s) = (1, 1),

but is instead a bound state of independent degrees of freedom, whose wave function is

given by the Wronskian functions (5.6), and more generally (5.31).

There are many possible extensions of this work that we have not touched upon. Various

computations and consistency checks have only been performed for particular examples;

a more general proof of these statements would surely provide deeper insight. We have

also omitted the entries in the bulk of the Kac table. To deﬁne the wave functions for

the corresponding branes, additional successive Wronskian operations must be performed

on products of the Wronskians considered herein; we leave an investigation of this more

complicated case for future work [37]. It would also be interesting to extend our results to

the non-diagonal theories with q > 2 studied in Chapters 3 and 4, which would allow for a

check of the results reported in [132].

Finally, a potential application of our results pertains to the analogy of the Baker-
Akhiezer function y (t;z ) with the correlator of a gauge theory dual to a spacetime with a

horizon [133]. Our results suggest that whilst perturbatively, we can obtain a description

of the physics behind the horizon by analytic continuation through the branch cut in the
complex z -plane, the non-perturbative correlator exhibits Stokes’ phenomenon signalling

the presence of independent degrees of freedom, as also alluded to in [29]. It would be

interesting to explore the implications of our results for this topic, which may pave the way

for an extension of these considerations to more complicated backgrounds such as Wit-

ten’s black hole captured by the SL(2, R)/U (1) coset model [134], which also has a matrix

description [135].

Summary

In this thesis, we have developed novel descriptions of boundary conditions for statistical

models on random surfaces employing the measure (2.4) in the planar, scaling, and dou-

ble scaling limit. We began by introducing each of these limits in Chapter 2, detailing

their connection to statistical physics on planar lattices, conformal ﬁeld theory and ﬁnally

non-perturbative string theory in a low target space dimension. In each of these cases, we

paid particular attention to the description of boundaries in the emsembles of random sur-

faces that arise in these limits. Following this compressed review came the three chapters

containing the bulk of the author’s original work, the main results of which we henceforth

summarise:

In Chapter 3, we derived the large-N spectral density of sums of random matrices of the
form X1 +X2 +. . .Xp, 1 ≤ p ≤ q, distributed according to (2.4) by generalising Voiculescu’s
formula (3.3) to a situation beyond free probability (Proposition 3.3.1) and explained the

interpretation of these quantities as disk partition functions of the q-states Potts model with

p allowed, equally weighted colors on a connected boundary. Besides ﬁnding a remarkable
algebraic relation between the boundary conditions with p and q − p colors (Corollary
3.3.3) and providing an elliptic parametrisation of the general solution for arbitrary q 6= 4
(Proposition 3.3.6), we derived the explicit polynomial equations satisﬁed by the latter for

Chapter6. Summary

speciﬁc examples with q = 1, 2, 3. The scaling relations obtained for these cases were found

to be consistent with a description in terms of Liouville theory coupled to a minimal model

with central charge cM = 0, 1/2 and 4/5, setting the stage for Chapter 4.

Therein, we considered the non-diagonal Wq minimal model with conserved higher-

spin currents coupled to Liouville theory as a description for the universality classes corre-

sponding to the critical points in the phase diagram of the model (2.4). Using the free-ﬁeld

resolution of the Wq-modules, we considered the cohomology of the nilpotent BRST op-

erator associated with worldsheet diffeomorphisms (Proposition 4.2.1) and deduced the

presence of the tachyon operators (4.6) in the spectrum of observables. We proceeded to

consider the one-point function of the latter on the disk and showed that the na¨ıve tensor

product of the Liouville FZZT and matter Cardy states appears to overcount the number

of physically distinct boundary conditions if one allows for complex values of the bound-

ary cosmological constant. This degeneracy provided a simple way to derive a functional

difference equation for the tachyon one-point functions that turned out to agree with the

equations obtained from the scaling limit of the matrix model.

Finally, in Chapter 5, we investigated the double scaling limit of (2.4) for q = 2 to un-

derstand the fate of this degeneracy beyond perturbation theory in the string coupling. We

argued that the resolvent operator may exhibit Stokes’ phenomenon and proposed a gen-

eralised Wronskian as an observable that can resolve the degeneracy non-perturbatively.

Without reference to conformal ﬁeld theory, we determined the differential equations that
govern the Wronskians (Propositions 5.2.4 and 5.2.6) and found a maximum of (p−1)(p′−
1)/2 independent Wronskians, one per Cardy state of the minimal model. Moreover, we

could explicitly show for various examples that each entry of the resulting Kac table consis-

tently reproduces the relation (5.1) predicted by conformal ﬁeld theory (Proposition 5.3.1).

We argued that this is strong evidence that the above-mentioned degeneracy is an artefact

of the asymptotic expansion and the usual determinant operator is insufﬁcient to capture all

information about the theory. Instead, the degeneracy is resolved non-perturbatively by the

104

Chapter6. Summary

independent degrees of freedom comprising the Wronskian.

Altogether, these developments have led to the description of a multitude of nontrivial,

well-deﬁned boundary conditions whose properties, to the knowledge of the author, have

not been previously described in the otherwise vast existing literature on the subject. This

suggests that despite the excellent understanding we have of these models – largely thanks

to their intimate connection to the theory of integrable systems – many of their properties

remain to be worked out. Indeed, as seen from the discussions in Section 3.6, 4.4 and 5.4,

this work has also prompted numerous follow-up questions that warrant further investiga-

tion, including the scaling behaviour of strongly coupled models with cM > 1, the inclusion

of magnetic ﬁelds on the boundary and the extension of the Wronskian to the interior of the

Kac table. It has also hinted at diverse connections to other ﬁelds, such as free probability

theory, higher-spin gravity in three dimensions and physics behind black hole horizons. Ex-

tending the insights of this thesis more comprehensively to some of the more complicated

models may be more challenging; not all of them may share the simplicity of the Hermi-

tian matrix model. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that some features discovered

herein may persist in more generality and it is the hope of the author that this thesis enticed

the reader about the potential of these avenues to further our general understanding of the

mathematical description of random geometry, boundaries and branes.

Auxiliary Saddle Point Problem

The general solution to this equation was ﬁrst described in [90] and we will derive it below;

thereafter we investigate the limit a /b → 0.

f (w(1 + s )) = f (w(1− s )) ,

s ∈ (0, 1)× iR .

Lax Operators

Here we provide the explicit form of the Lax matrices for (p, p′) = (3, 2), (4, 3) and (5, 2),
respectively, with the abbrevation up,z = up − z .
Example C.0.4. (p, p′) = (3, 2). The compatibility condition (2.90) implies u2(t) = 3v2(t)

and u3(t) = 3 ˙v2(t)/2, where v2(t) solves the ﬁrst Painlev´e equation: ¨v2(t) = 6v2(t) +t. For

n = 1, 2, we ﬁnd
