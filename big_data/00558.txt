In order to identify the pairing symmetry with chirality, we study site-selective NMR in chiral
p-wave superconductors. We calculate local nuclear relaxation rate T −1
in the vortex lattice state by
Eilenberger theory, including the applied magnetic ﬁeld dependence. We ﬁnd that T −1
in the NMR
resonance line shape is diﬀerent between two chiral states p±(= px±ipy), depending on whether the
chirality is parallel or anti-parallel to the vorticity. Anomalous suppression of T −1
occurs around the
vortex core in the chiral p−-wave due to the negative coherence term coming from the odd-frequency
s-wave Cooper pair induced around the vortex with Majorana state.

INTRODUCTION

In the study of unconventional superconductors, it is
most important to identify the spin and orbital symme-
try of the Cooper pairs since it is tightly related to the
mechanism of superconductivity. The pairing symmetry
of the ruthenate superconductor Sr2RuO4 is suggested to
be chiral p±-wave1,2, where Cooper pairs have angular
momentum Lz = ±1 for p± = px ± ipy. For experimen-
tal evidence, the spin triplet paring is supported by the
Knight shift measurement3 and the broken time-reversal
symmetry coming from the chiral pair was observed by
µSR4 and polar Kerr eﬀect5 measurements. However,
any experiment to identify the direction of the chirality,
i.e., p+ or p− in Sr2RuO4 is not yet realized, since the
µSR and the polar Kerr eﬀect measurements can only
detect the existence of chirality (Lz = 0 or 6=0).

The spatially resolved NMR measurement6–9 called
site-selective NMR can detect local electronic states re-
lated to the pairing symmetry in the vortex lattice state
by selectively observing the resonance ﬁeld dependence
of the nuclear relaxation rate T −1
in the NMR resonance
line shape. This measurement is complementary method
to the scanning tunneling microscopy measurement, since
the NMR measurement is free from the material surface
condition. From our previous studies for site-selective
NMR10,11, local (T1T )−1 in the vortex lattice state is de-
termined by local density of states (DOS) of electrons
in the s- and dx2−y2 -wave superconductors. As for the
chiral p-wave superconductor, previous theories suggest
that the temperature T -dependence of T −1
is diﬀerent
between p+ and p− states at the vortex center12–14. This
chirality-dependence is caused by the interaction between
the chirality and vorticity, depending on whether the chi-
rality Lz(= ±1) is parallel or anti-parallel to the vorticity
W (= 1) in the vortex state of chiral p-wave superconduc-
tors 15–18.

Recently, the chiral p-wave superconductors have been
attracting much attention as a topological superconduc-
tor, since it has non-trivial topological properties. In this
superconductor, topological defects such as vortex or sur-

face induce Majorana fermions19–21. Majorana fermions
give rise to anomalous electric states such as Majorana
zero mode and non-Abelian statistics of the vortices20. In
addition, the vortex state of chiral p-wave superconduc-
tors also induces odd-frequency Cooper pairs18,22,23. In
particular, the odd-frequency s-wave Cooper pair in the
vortex state of chiral p-wave superconductors is related
to the Majorana fermion23.

The purpose of this paper is that we investigate the
method to identify the pairing symmetry with chiral-
ity by the site-selective NMR measurement.
In chiral
p-wave superconductors, it is signiﬁcant to prove topo-
logical numbers Lz and W as well as local DOS. From
this view point, we study the chirality-dependence of lo-
cal T −1
(r) in the resonance ﬁeld dependence in the vortex
lattice state. We especially focus on anomalous suppres-
sion of T −1
around the vortex core in the chiral p−-wave.
Further, we will discuss reasons for the anomalous sup-
pression of T −1
in the relation to odd-frequency Cooper
pairs induced around the vortex with Majorana state.

II. FORMULATION

We calculate the spatial structure of the vortex lat-
tice state by quasiclassical Eilenberger theory 11,16,24.
The quasiclassical theory is valid when the atomic scale
is enough small compared to the superconducting co-
herence length ξ. For many superconductors including
Sr2RuO4, this quasiclassical condition is well satisﬁed1,2.
Moreover, since our calculations are performed in the
vortex lattice state, distributions of local T −1
and the
resonance ﬁeld are quantitatively obtained as a function
of temperature and applied ﬁeld. Therefore, our calcu-

1

lation method is powerful and reliable tool dealing with
the inhomogeneous spatial structure of superconducting
properties.

As a simple model of Sr2RuO4, we consider the chi-
ral p-wave pairing on the cylindrical Fermi surface, k =
(kx, ky) = kF(cos θk, sin θk), and the Fermi velocity vF =
vF0k/kF. Quasiclassical Green’s functions g(iωn, k, r),
f (iωn, k, r), f †(iωn, k, r) are calculated by solving Eilen-
berger equation

{ωn + v · (∇ + iA(r))} f = ˜∆(r, k)g,
{ωn − v · (∇ − iA(r))} f † = ˜∆∗(r, k)g,

(1)
where g = (1 − f f †)1/2, and v = vF/vF0. The order pa-
rameter is ˜∆(r, k) = ∆+(r)φp+(k) + ∆−(r)φp−(k) with
the pairing function φp±(k) = (kx±iky)/kF = e±iθk for
the chiral p±-wave. r is the center-of-mass coordinate of
the pair. When magnetic ﬁelds are applied along the z
axis, the vector potential is given by A(r) = 1
H×r+a(r)
2
in the symmetric gauge, where H = (0, 0, H) is a uni-
form ﬂux density, and a(r) is related to the internal ﬁeld
B(r) = (0, 0, B(r)) = H + ∇ × a(r). We have scaled
temperature, length, and magnetic ﬁeld in unit of Tc0,
ξ0, and B0, where ξ0 = ¯hvF0/2πkBTc0, B0 = φ0/2πξ2
0
with the ﬂux quantum φ0, respectively. Tc0 is transition
temperature at a zero ﬁeld. The energy E, pair potential
∆ and Matsubara frequency ωn are in unit of πkBTc0. In
the following, we set ¯h = kB = 1.

To determine ∆±(r) and the quasiclassical Green’s
functions selfconsistently, we calculate ∆±(r) by the gap
equation

∆±(r) = g0N0T X0<ωn≤ωcut

, (2)

where (g0N0)−1 = ln T + 2T P0<ωn≤ωcut
n , and we
use ωcut = 20kBTc0. h···ik indicates the Fermi surface
average. For the selfconsistent calculation of the vector
potential for the internal ﬁeld B(r), we use the relation

ω−1

∇ × (∇ × A) = −2T κ−2 X0<ωn

hvIm{g}ik .

(3)

In our calculations, we use the Ginzburg-Landau param-
eter11,24,25 κ = 2.7 appropriate to Sr2RuO4

1,2.

We iterate calculations of Eqs. (1)-(3) in Matsubara
frequency ωn in the square vortex lattice26, until we ob-
tain the selfconsistent results of A(r), ∆(r) and the qua-
siclassical Green’s functions. We consider two states of
p±.
In the p+ state, where chirality and vorticity are
parallel, ∆+(r) is main component and ∆−(r) is induced
around vortices. In the p− state where ∆−(r) is main
component, chirality and vorticity are anti-parallel. The
studies of phase diagram for thermodynamically stable
states have been already reported in Refs.15,16. Accord-
ing to these previous studies, the p− state has a lower free
energy than the metastable p+ state in all T -H range ex-
cept for H = 0. At the H = 0, the chiral p± states are
degenerate in free energy. We study not only the sta-
ble p− state case but also the metastable p+ state case.

2

From our calculation results, the upper critical ﬁeld is
Hc2/B0 = 0.84 at T /Tc0 = 0.5 for the p− state. The p+
state is unstable at H/B0 > 0.31 at T /Tc0 = 0.5, and
changes to the p− state.

Next, using the selfconsistently obtained A(r) and
∆(r), we calculate quasiclassical Green’s functions in real
energy E ± iη instead of iωn. Since we consider the clean
case with long lifetime of quasiparticle, we use enough
small η(= 0.01), maintaining the accuracy of numeri-
cal calculation. We solve Eilenberger equation (1) with
iωn → E ± iη to obtain g(E ± iη, k, r), f (E ± iη, k, r),
f †(E ± iη, k, r). The local DOS N (E, r) is given by
N (E, r) = hRe{g(E + iη, k, r)}ik.
Based on the linear response theory, from the obtained
quasiclassical Green’s functions, the nuclear relaxation
rate T −1

is calculated as11,13

from the DOS term Wgg, and (T1f f T )−1 is the contribu-
tion from the coherence term Wf f .

III. LOCAL NMR RELAXATION RATE

First, we study the T -dependence of local (T1T )−1
shown in Fig. 1 for p± states. For a reference, we
also show the dx2−y2-wave pairing state ˜∆(r, k) =
∆d(r)√2 cos 2θk
11. Outside of vortex core, such as the
midpoint between next nearest neighbor (NNN) vortices
in Fig. 1(a), the T -dependence is similar to the bulk
chiral p-wave superconductors in both p± states. There,
we see exponential T -dependence at low T , reﬂecting the
full gap |φp±| = 1. On the other hand, around the vor-
tex core in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), we see the diﬀerent be-
haviors depending on the chirality directions. In the p+
state, (T1T )−1 is more enhanced with approaching the

vortex center. This enhancement is due to the localized
low energy DOS around the vortex core, and moderate
compared to the dx2−y2-wave pairing state11. However,
the enhancement does not occur in the p− state in Figs.
1(b) and 1(c). The reason of this suppression is related to
the odd-frequency Cooper pairs around the vortex core,
as discussed later.

As shown in Fig. 2, to see the spatial dependence
in detail, we present local (T1T )−1 as a function of ra-
dius r on a line between NNN vortices. Outside of the
vortex core r/ax≥0.2, (T1T )−1 shows almost the same
r-dependence between the p+ and p− states. Inside the
vortex core, it is characteristic that (T1T )−1 is enhanced
in the p+ state, but it is anomalously suppressed in the

decreases as a function of r in the d-wave, but it has
a minimum at r ∼ 0.175ax in the p+ state. The mini-
mum region surrounding the vortex core is also seen in

FIG. 3. (Color online) Solid lines indicate the Redﬁeld pattern
of the NMR resonance line shape, P (B), for the p− state.
Points are for B-dependence of (T1T )−1 for the p+ and p−
states. The dx2−y2 -wave case is also shown. T /Tc0 = 0.5 and
H/B0 = 0.02(a), 0.10(b), 0.20(c). (T1T )−1 is normalized by
the value at Tc. Only data points (T1T )−1≤1.2 are presented
in (a), (b) and (c).

Next, we discuss how the diﬀerence between p+ and p−
states is detected in the site-selective NMR measurement.
From the internal ﬁeld distribution B(r), we theoretically
obtain the Redﬁeld pattern27 of the NMR resonance line

shape, as P (ω) = R δ(ω − B(r))dr, since the intensity

at each resonance frequency ω comes from the volume
satisfying ω = B(r) in a unit cell.
In Sr2RuO4, P (B)
was observed by µSR28.
In Fig. 3(a), with P (B), we
plot local (T1T )−1 as a function of local ﬁeld B(r) at
the same position r. At lower resonance ﬁelds B/H < 1
near the peak of P (B), NMR signals come from outside
of the vortex cores. In this range, (T1T )−1 decreases as
a function of B in both p± states similarly. The tail of
P (B) at higher B is approaching the vortex center. In
this range B/H > 1, we can see the chirality dependence,

i.e., (T1T )−1 increases as a function of B in the p+ state,
but it decreases in the p− state. However, at the low
applied ﬁeld H, the signal of the vortex core contribu-
tion at higher B is weak in P (B). On the other hand, at
higher applied ﬁeld H as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c),
the signal for distinguishing the chirality becomes larger
in P (B), since weight of the vortex core region increases
within the unit cell of the vortex lattice with increasing
H. In Fig. 3(b), (T1T )−1 in the p+ state increases as
a function of B in all resonance ﬁled range, while it is
almost ﬂat in the p− state except for largest B. In Fig.
3(c), (T1T )−1 in both p± states increases as a function
of B. From these calculation results, we can identify the
direction of the chirality i.e., p+ or p− state by measuring
B-dependence of (T1T )−1. In particular, it is important
that we observe the monotonically decreasing or ﬂat be-
havior of (T1T )−1 as a function of B, since this behavior
is realized only in the p− state. And, from the previous
studies15,16, it is expected that the p− state has a lower
free energy than the metastable p+ state in the vortex
state. However, we should be careful about strength of
applied ﬁeld, since B-dependence of (T1T )−1 changes as
shown in Fig. 3(c), when the applied ﬁeld is too high.

IV. RELATION TO ODD-FREQUENCY

COOPER PAIRS

To discuss the reasons for the anomalous suppression of
T −1
around the vortex core in the chiral p-wave supercon-
1
ductors, we present the decomposition of (T1T )−1 to the
DOS term (T1ggT )−1 and the coherence term (T1f f T )−1
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). There, we see that (T1ggT )−1 is
enhanced around the vortex core in both p± states simi-
larly, as in the s- and dx2−y2 -wave cases11. The enhance-
ment reﬂects low energy DOS around the vortex core.
The chirality-dependence appears in negative coherence
term (T1f f T )−1.
In the p− state, negative (T1f f T )−1
cancels the enhancement of (T1ggT )−1, so that (T1T )−1 is
suppressed in the vortex core. In the p+ state, weak sup-
pression of (T1T )−1 in the region surrounding vortex in

FIG. 4. (Color online) r-dependence of (T1T )−1, (T1ggT )−1,
(T1f f T )−1 in (a) the p+ state and (b) the p− state. (T1T )−1,
(T1ggT )−1, (T1f f T )−1 is normalized by (T1(Tc)Tc)−1.
r-
dependence of orbital-decomposed Cooper pair’s amplitude
|Fm(E = 0)| in (c) the p+ state and (d) the p− state. m = s,
p±, and d2±. In all ﬁgures, T /Tc0 = 0.5 and H/B0 = 0.02. r
is radius from the vortex center along the NNN vortex direc-
tion. In the p− state, |Fd2+ (r, E = 0)|∼|Fd2− (r, E = 0)|.

Fig. 2 is also due to the small negative term (T1f f T )−1.
Therefore, in the p+ state, we can say that the (T1ggT )−1
of a normal signal obscures the (T1f f T )−1 of a superﬂuid
response. However, in the p− state, since the superﬂuid
response is enhanced around the vortex core including the
proximity eﬀect of superconductivity, the normal signal
does not obscure the superﬂuid response.

At last, we discuss origin of the negative coherence
term. From Eqs. (4)-(6), s-wave pair can contribute to
the coherence term (T1f f T )−1 since the condition hfik6=0
with Lz = 0. Actually, in conventional s-wave super-
conductor, a Hebel-Slichter peak appears below Tc due
to the coherence term11,29,30. To check this condition,
we calculate orbital-decomposed Cooper pair Fm(E, r) =
hφ∗
m(k)f (E + iη, k, r)ik. In addition to φp±(k), we em-
ploy φs(k) = 1 for the s-wave, and φd2±(k) = e±i2θ
for the chiral d-wave. The obtained s- and d-wave com-
ponents in the chiral p-wave superconductors are odd-

frequency Cooper pair18.
In Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), we
present the r-dependence of |Fm(E = 0, r)|, where the in-
duced s- and d-wave amplitude have large values around
the vortex core. As summarized in Table I, the vorticity
W of the symmetry component Fm with the chirality Lz
is determined by the condition Lz + W = 2 in the p+
state and Lz + W = 0 in the p− state. In the p+ state,
chiral d2+-wave component has W = 0, giving large am-
plitude at the vortex center. Small induced s-wave com-
ponent also appears, but it vanishes at the vortex center
since it has W = 2, as shown in Fig. 4(c).
In the p−
state, the s-wave component has W = 0 thus it has large
amplitude at the vortex center, as shown in Fig. 4(d).
The odd-frequency s-wave Cooper pair determines the
r-dependence of the negative coherence term (T1f f T )−1
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). In particular, at low T limit, we
conﬁrmed that (T1f f T )−1∼−|Fs(E = 0)|2 at the vortex
center from the calculation results.
The previous theoretical study using the Andreev
bound state model showed that T −1
at the vortex cen-
ter is completely zero (T −1
1 ∼0) due to the coherence ef-
fect when the Lz is anti-parallel to the W 14. On the
other hand, previous our study using the Bogoliubov-
de Gennes theory conﬁrmed the relation N (E =
0, r)∝|Fs(E = 0, r)| in the p− state for the vortex core
quasiparticle states with Majorana zero mode23. Consid-
ering these relation, we ﬁnd that the (T1f f T )−1 related to
the odd-frequency s-wave Cooper pair tends to cancel the
local DOS term (T1ggT )−1, since (T1gg(r)T )−1∼N (E =
0, r)2 and (T1f f (r)T )−1∼ − |Fs(E = 0, r)|2 at low T and
H limit (low energy limit). Therefore, the anomalous
suppression of (T1T )−1 is also explained by the nature
of Majorana state. Note that, in our calculation results
at ﬁnite T and H states, (T1T )−1 is not completely zero
around the vortex core, since quasiparticle states diﬀer-
ent from Majorana zero mode also contribute to the NMR
relaxation, as shown in Fig. 2.

When we discuss the inﬂuence of the sub-dominant
components, we have to distinguish the order parameter
∆ and the pair amplitude F . The sub-dominant compo-
nents such as odd-frequency s- and d-wave Cooper pairs
vanish in the order parameter, since the order parameter
is determined by the gap equation of Eq. (2). Therefore,
the qualitatively unique mechanism of negative coher-
ence term related to the odd-frequency Cooper pairs in
the chiral p-wave superconductors does not seriously de-
pend on the details of setting the pairing interaction for
the sub-dominant order parameter.

V. SUMMARY

We have calculated the T -, r- and B-dependence of
the local NMR relaxation rate (T1T )−1 in two chiral p±
states, and dx2−y2-wave as a reference. We have clari-
ﬁed that (T1T )−1 in the p+ state is enhanced with ap-
proaching the vortex center by the contribution of low
energy excitations of the vortex core, but it is anoma-
lously suppressed around the vortex core in the p− state.
This chirality-dependence of local (T1T )−1 may be ob-
served by the site-selective NMR measurement via the
B-dependence of (T1T )−1 in P (B). Further, we have
theoretically found that the anomalous suppression of
(T1T )−1 around the vortex core is due to the negative
coherence term by the induced odd-frequency s-wave
Cooper pair with Majorana state.

We hope that these theoretical estimates of

local
(T1T )−1 will be conﬁrmed by the site-selective NMR
measurement, and will be used for detecting the pairing
symmetry with chirality in the chiral p-wave supercon-
ductors, and natures of odd-frequency Cooper pairs and
Majorana states.
