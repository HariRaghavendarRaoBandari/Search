Co-intercalation is a potential approach to inﬂuence the voltage and mobility with which cations
insert in electrodes for energy storage devices. Combining a robust thermodynamic model with ﬁrst-
principles calculations, we present a detailed investigation revealing the important role of H2O during
ion intercalation in nano-materials. We examine the scenario of Mg2+ and H2O co-intercalation in
nano-crystalline Xerogel-V2O5, a potential cathode material to achieve energy density greater than
Li-ion batteries. Water co-intercalation in cathode materials could broadly impact an electrochem-
ical system by inﬂuencing its voltages or causing passivation at the anode. The analysis of the
stable phases of Mg-Xerogel V2O5 and voltages at diﬀerent electrolytic conditions reveals a range of
concentrations for Mg in the Xerogel and H2O in the electrolyte where there is no thermodynamic
driving force for H2O to shuttle with Mg during electrochemical cycling. Also, we demonstrate that
H2O shuttling with the Mg2+ ions in wet electrolytes yields higher voltages than in dry electrolytes.
The thermodynamic framework used to study water and Mg2+ co-intercalation in this work opens
the door for studying the general phenomenon of solvent co-intercalation observed in other complex
solvent-electrode pairs used in the Li- and Na-ion chemical spaces.

INTRODUCTION

analogues,7,8

Several cathode materials that have shown apprecia-
ble electrochemical performance in Li- and Na-ion bat-
teries are inﬂuenced by the presence of H2O in ei-
ther the cathode structure or the electrolyte. A few
examples of these include the MnO2 polymorphs –
distorted-spinel Mn2O4,1 Hollandite,2 and Birnessite,3,4
Tavorite-FeSO4F,5,6 Prussian-blue
2D
Nb/V carbides,9 and Xerogel-V2O5.10–14 While it is spec-
ulated that structural H2O increases the mobility of the
intercalating redox-active cation by solvation,15,16 a key
challenge has been to establish whether the structural
H2O stays in the electrode or perhaps shuttles with the
cation during electrochemical cycling. More generally,
the co-intercalation of solvent molecules in layered mate-
rials has recently been a focus of great research activity;
for example, the thermodynamically prohibited intercala-
tion of Na+ in graphitic anode electrodes is made possible
by solvent co-intercalation,17 while the spinel → layered
phase transition in MnO2 electrodes is facilitated by wa-
ter intercalation.18

Determining how the presence or co-intercalation of
water in an electrode inﬂuences the intercalation of
cations may help to explain contrasting phenomena such
as high capacities in a few intercalation systems4,19–21
and rapid capacity fade in a few others,22–24 when wa-
ter is present.
In this study, we investigate the role
that H2O plays in the intercalation of Mg2+ in nanocrys-
talline Xerogel-V2O5. Using ﬁrst-principles calculations,
we demonstrate that water co-intercalation with Mg2+
is diﬀerent in wet and dry electrolytes and generally in-
creases the Mg insertion voltage.

While replacing Li+ with a multi-valent ion, such as
Mg2+ coupled with a Mg metal anode, is viewed as a
potential way to achieve higher energy densities than
current Li-ion batteries,25–27 obtaining cathode materi-
als that can reversibly intercalate Mg2+ at high volt-
age and with substantial capacity remains a pressing
challenge.16,28,29 As a known Li-intercalation host,30 and
being one of the few cathode materials that has shown
reversible electrochemical Mg2+ intercalation,4,15,20,31–35
V2O5 is a key component in the design of future multi-
valent cathodes. Although orthorhombic-V2O5 pos-
sesses multiple polymorphs,30 the nanocrystalline bilay-
ered form of Xerogel-V2O5 is expected to have good Mg
mobility owing to electrostatic shielding of the divalent
Mg2+ by the water contained in the structure.15,16

Electrochemical experiments intercalating Mg2+ in
the Xerogel have reported varying voltages and capac-
ities when employing organic36–39 and aqueous40,41 elec-
trolytes, respectively. Imamura et al.36,37 showed Mg in-
sertion in Xerogel-V2O5 using acetonitrile (AN) at volt-
ages and capacities higher than that observed with the or-
thorhombic form33,34 with cyclic performance up to ∼ 40
cycles at a current density of ∼ 17 mA/g. Tepavcevic et
al.38 explored a full-cell arrangement consisting of a Sn
anode, Mg(ClO4)2 dissolved in an AN electrolyte and
a magnesiated Xerogel cathode and showed reversible
Mg intercalation limited by anode capacity. Lee et al.39
compared the electrochemical performance of AN and
an ethylene carbonate: dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC)
mixture as solvents for Mg insertion and reported im-
proved kinetics with AN than EC:DMC. Stojkovi´c et al.40
demonstrated reversible Mg intercalation in aqueous elec-
trolytes with a capacity of ∼ 107 mAh/g at a higher ini-

pared to the experiments with organic electrolytes.36,38
Recently, Vujkovi´c et al.41 reported high capacity reten-
tion (∼ 30 cycles) for Mg2+ cycling in Xerogel under
aqueous electrolytes in comparison to Li+, Na+ or K+.
So far, there have been no theoretical studies under-
taken on the Mg-Xerogel V2O5 system to reveal the role
of water co-intercalation under diﬀerent solvent condi-
tions. In the present work, we describe the Xerogel-V2O5
structure, the phase diagram at 0 K, and voltages as a
function of both Mg and H2O content in the structure.
We investigate whether the structural H2O in the Xe-
rogel shuttles with the Mg2+ ion during cycling at vari-
ous electrolytic conditions and Mg concentrations in the
structure. Finally, we have explored the importance of
electrochemical systems with solvent co-intercalation into
electrodes, leading to solvent-based voltages that can im-
pact the design of future electrolyte-electrode systems.

II. METHODS

To study the eﬀect of H2O on Mg intercalation and
understand possible co-intercalation of H2O with the Mg
ions, we equilibrate the Mg-Xerogel V2O5 system open
to varying amounts of H2O in the electrolyte as governed
by the grand-potential, Φ = GMg-V2O5 − nH2O.µH2O,
with GMg-V2O5, nH2O and µH2O the Gibbs energy of
the Mg-Xerogel V2O5, the number of moles of water
in the Xerogel and the chemical potential of H2O in
the electrolyte, respectively. Grand-potential phase dia-
grams have been used to study open electrochemical sys-
tems before.42,43 While we use Density Functional The-
ory (DFT, see later)44 calculations to obtain values of
GMg-V2O5 at diﬀerent Mg concentrations in the Xerogel
structure, the procedure used to obtain an accurate refer-
ence state for water (µH2O) is detailed in the Supporting
Information (SI).∗#

DFT calculations are performed with the Vienna Ab
Initio Simulation Package,45,46 employing the Projec-
tor Augmented Wave theory47 with an energy cut-oﬀ of
520 eV for describing the wave functions sampled on a
well-converged k -point (6×2×2) mesh. A Hubbard U
correction of 3.1 eV is added to remove the spurious self-
interaction of the vanadium d -electrons.48–50 For calcu-
lating voltages and phase diagrams at 0 K, the Perdew-
Burke-Ernzerhof functional51 in the Generalized Gradi-
ent Approximation (GGA) is employed. Since layered
materials such as Xerogel-V2O5 are bound by van der
Waals interactions that are not well captured by stan-
dard DFT,52,53 the vdW-DF2+U functional54,55 is used
to compute the layer spacing values (b−axis in Figure 1).
However, preliminary investigations31,32,56 have shown

that GGA+U describes the energetics of redox reactions
in layered materials better than vdW-DF2+U.

III. STRUCTURE

As the Mg- and H-positions in the Mg-intercalated Xe-
rogel structure are not known experimentally, we have
combined relevant experimental information with DFT
calculations to obtain for the ﬁrst time an atomic-level
structural description of this system. While Petkov et
al.57 resolved the Xerogel-V2O5 structure by employing
pair distribution functions from X-ray diﬀraction mea-
surements, the positions of the intercalant atom were not
reported. Oka et al.58 described the Mg sites in σ-V2O5,
which has a bilayered arrangement but is diﬀerent from
the Xerogel-V2O5 structure. In order to describe not only
the Mg (intercalant) positions in the Xerogel structure
but also the positions of the water molecules, comprising
the oxygen (Ow) and the hydrogen atoms, we choose the
Ni-intercalated bilayered V2O5 structure as a template
(see Figure 1).59 As Ni and Mg have similar octahedral
coordination preference,60 the initial positions of the Mg
atoms are obtained from the known Ni-positions in the
bilayered structure.59 In this structure, Ni (Mg) is coor-
dinated by 2 oxygen atoms from the VO5 pyramids and
4 Ow atoms as shown in Figure 1. The H-positions for
the intercalated water in the Xerogel are initialized using
a 3-step strategy by placing H-atoms ∼ 1 ˚A away from
the Ow as explained in the SI and then relaxing these
structures with DFT.

Figure 1a and b display the fully relaxed structures of
the fully magnesiated and demagnesiated Xerogel respec-
tively, containing 1 H2O per formula unit of V2O5 (i.e.,
nH2O = 1) on the b−c plane. Two individual V2O5 layers
(red polyhedra in Figure 1) are bound by long interlayer
V−O bonds (∼ 2.66 ˚A) in the fully demagnesiated struc-
ture that lead to the formation of a single ‘bilayer’ of
V2O5, giving rise to the term “bilayered” V2O5. While
each V2O5 bilayer is composed of both VO5 square pyra-
mids and VO6 octahedra, the intercalant atoms and the
H2O molecules are found in the space between two bilay-
ers. In this work the a−, b−, and c−axes indicate the
shortest axis, the inter-bilayer spacing direction, and the
longest axis, respectively.

The orange octahedra in Figure 1a correspond to Mg
atoms (at the center) coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms.
As illustrated in the enlarged version of the Mg coordi-
nation environment (green circles, Figure 1a), each Mg is
bonded to 4 Ow atoms and 2 O atoms of the VOx poly-
hedra (referred to as ‘lattice’ oxygen). While H atoms
(in white) are bound to Ow, the dashed blue lines in
Figure 1a indicate hydrogen-bonding between the water
molecules and the lattice oxygen. The inﬂuence of H2O
molecules on the electronic structure and density of states
in the Mg-Xerogel system is examined in Section 8 of the
SI.

On Mg removal, hydrogen-bonding becomes more

FIG. 1: Structures of the fully magnesiated (xMg = 0.5) and the fully demagnesiated Xerogel, with 1 H2O per formula unit of
V2O5 are displayed in (a) and (b) respectively. The coordination of each Mg by 4 Ow can be observed in the enlarged image in
the green circle, with the dashed blue lines indicating hydrogen-bonding between the water molecules and the lattice oxygen.
The atomic species in the Xerogel structure are labelled in the enlarged image with Ow and Ox indicating the water and lattice
oxygen, respectively.

prominent amongst the H2O molecules than with the
lattice oxygen, as deduced by the shorter O–H bond-
ing distances (∼ 1.6 – 1.8 ˚A) between H and next-
nearest Ow atoms compared to hydrogen and lattice oxy-
gen (∼ 2.2 – 2.6 ˚A), leading to the formation of stable
hydrogen-bonded arrangements in the a− and c− direc-
tions (dashed green square in Figure 1b). The Xerogel
structure in our work is limited to 2 fully occupied Mg
sites for every 8 vanadium sites, hence the maximum Mg
content in the structure is xMg = 0.5 per formula unit
of V2O5, hereafter referred to as the “fully magnesiated”
state. Based on our observations in the Ni-based Xerogel
structure, we assumed a maximum of 4 H2O molecules
for 8 vanadium sites, and nH2O = 1 (per V2O5 formula
unit) is denoted as the “fully hydrated” state.

The inter-bilayer spacing for the fully magnesiated
phase (at nH2O = 1) using GGA+U is ∼ 10.18 ˚A, which
agrees well with ∼ 10.22 ˚A predicted by the vdW-DF2+U
functional, and is similar to the experimental value of
∼ 10.36 ˚A reported for the Ni-intercalated phase.59 The
Mg and H2O positions calculated by GGA+U and vdW-
DF2+U are similar, suggesting that the Mg-O electro-
static interactions dominate the geometry of the bilayer
once Mg is inserted. For the fully demagnesiated phase
(at nH2O = 1), the inter-bilayer spacing computed by
GGA+U (∼ 12.76 ˚A) diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the vdW-
DF2+U value (∼ 11.28 ˚A) and the experimental value of
∼ 11.52 ˚A.57 Although GGA+U overestimates the layer
spacing for the fully demagnesiated Xerogel structure (at
nH2O = 1, as in Figure 1b), the hydrogen-bonded ar-
rangement of H2O molecules is similar to that found with
the vdW-DF2+U functional.

IV. EQUILIBRATION OF THE WATER

CONTENT

Obtaining the equilibrium water content in the Xero-
gel requires one to know the free energy of the cathode
as a function of the water content in the electrolyte, af-
ter which a minimization of the grand potential at the
µH2O of the electrolyte gives the equilibrium amount
of H2O in the cathode. We calculated the free ener-
gies of various Xerogel structures, enumerated in super-
cell volumes twice that of the conventional cell. We
assessed the stability of the enumerated structures at
xMg = 0, 0.25 and 0.5, containing various amounts of
co-intercalated H2O (nH2O = 0, 0.5 and 1), and for sev-
eral water-concentration regimes in the electrolyte (see
Figure S1 in the SI).

The stable Mg-Xerogel V2O5 phases, obtained by min-
imizing the grand-potential at 0 K, are plotted in Fig-
ure 2 as a function of aH2O and the Mg chemical potential
(µMg) with pictorial descriptions provided in Figure S2
in the SI. A high Mg chemical potential, such as µMg = 0
(see Section 6, SI), refers to a highly magnesiated Xerogel
conﬁguration (xMg = 0.5), while decreasing the chemical
potential represents a more oxidizing environment that
leads to demagnesiation (xMg ∼ 0). To explore the eﬀect
of changing electrolytic conditions on the electrochemical
properties of Xerogel-V2O5, we consider three diﬀerent
regimes (separated by dashed lines in Figure 2): i) wet
or aqueous electrolyte, where the water activity, aH2O, is
set to ∼ 1, ii) dry with 10−2 < aH2O < 10−6, and iii)
superdry with aH2O < 10−7. An activity aH2O = 10−4
would correspond to ≈ 10 ppm by weight of water un-
der the ideal solution approximation in solvents such as
glymes61,62. Each colored region in Figure 2 corresponds
to a single stable phase, whose composition is indicated
with a Mgx(H2O)nV2O5 notation. While the lines sepa-
rating the single phase regions indicate the co-existence
of two phases, the triple points correspond to a three

bac(b)bac(a)MgOwHOxVphase co-existence.

FIG. 2: The Grand-potential phase diagram at 0 K of Mg-
Xerogel V2O5 as a function of various electrolytic conditions
and Mg chemical potentials is shown. Each colored region rep-
resents a single phase with the indicated Mg and water con-
tent. The dashed lines display diﬀerent electrolytic regimes,
with µMg = 0 corresponding to full magnesiation.

For a wet electrolyte (aH2O ∼ 1), the ground state
structures as a function of µMg consist of the fully mag-
nesiated − fully hydrated structure (xMg = 0.5, nH2O = 1
per V2O5, blue region in Figure 2), the ‘half’ magnesiated
− half hydrated structure (xMg = 0.25, nH2O = 0.5, yel-
low region), and the fully demagnesiated − dehydrated
structure (xMg = 0, nH2O = 0, red region). Hence, under
these electrolyte conditions, each Mg2+ intercalates with
two H2O molecules and a decrease in Mg content also
corresponds to a decrease of water intercalated. Thus,
when an aqueous electrolyte is used, there is a thermo-
dynamic driving force for the water content to change
with the Mg content.
When Mg2+ intercalation occurs from a dry electrolyte
(10−2 < aH2O < 10−6), the ground state phases are:
xMg = 0.5, nH2O = 0.5 (fully magnesiated − half hy-
drated, pink region in Figure 2), xMg = 0.25, nH2O = 0.5
(half magnesiated − half hydrated, yellow), and xMg =0,
nH2O = 0 (fully demagnesiated − dehydrated, red). The
results demonstrate that in a dry electrolyte, H2O co-
intercalates with Mg for xMg < 0.25, whereas the water
content remains unchanged as more Mg is inserted.
For a superdry electrolyte (aH2O < 10−7) the stable
phases consist of fully dehydrated structures, both at
xMg = 0.5 (fully magnesiated, green region in Figure 2)
and xMg = 0 (fully demagnesiated, red). The absence of
ground state conﬁgurations at intermediate Mg composi-
tions (Figure S1c in the SI) in a superdry electrolyte indi-
cates a phase separating behavior into Mg-rich and Mg-
poor domains. Since the superdry ground states are fully
dehydrated, there is a high driving force for all the water
in the Xerogel to leave the structure. Interestingly, the
activity of H2O in the electrolyte not only inﬂuences the
level of co-intercalation but also controls the nature of the
Mg intercalation. Without water Mg-intercalation occurs

4

as a 2-phase reaction between xMg = 0 and xMg = 0.5,
whereas water in the electrolyte stabilizes intermediate
Mg states.

The ground state structure of V2O5, across the range
of µMg and aH2O considered is the orthorhombic α-
V2O5,30,31 which is consistent with experimental ev-
idence of an irreversible transformation of the Xero-
gel to α-V2O5 at high temperatures,63 suggesting the
metastable nature of the Xerogel.
In fact, the α poly-
morph is lower in energy at xMg = 0 and 0.5 compared
to the dehydrated Xerogel phases (red and green regions
in Figure 2) by ∼ 360 meV/f.u. and ∼ 200 meV/f.u.,
respectively.

Combining the results of Figure 2, we ﬁnd that un-
der wet conditions Mg2+ ions shuttle along with H2O
molecules across Mg concentrations, whereas under dry
conditions H2O co-intercalation only occurs between 0 ≤
xMg ≤ 0.25. Hence, water will not shuttle with Mg un-
der dry conditions and high Mg concentrations (0.25 ≤
xMg ≤ 0.5) in the Xerogel.
In a superdry electrolyte,
there is no H2O within the Xerogel structure. Although
we have discussed the general phenomenon of Mg-H2O
co-intercalation4,15 for the case of Xerogel-V2O5, sim-
ilar models are readily applicable to study solvent co-
intercalation in other layered electrode materials.17

V. EFFECT OF WATER ON THE MG

INSERTION VOLTAGE

FIG. 3: Average Mg insertion voltage for low (red line) and
high (blue) Mg concentrations as a function of the electrolyte
water content (aH2O). Equations on the curves indicate the
change in H2O content in the Xerogel as Mg is inserted in
each electrolytic regime.

In regimes where H2O shuttles with the Mg, the ac-
tivity of water aﬀects the cell voltage, as illustrated by
the average voltage curves computed for Mg insertion
into Xerogel-V2O5 in Figure 3. The voltages as a func-
tion of aH2O, under the wet (cyan background), dry

the phase diagram of Figure 2, using the procedure de-
tailed in the SI.64 The red and blue lines indicate the
voltages for Mg insertion between concentration ranges
of 0 ≤ xMg ≤ 0.25 and 0.25 ≤ xMg ≤ 0.5 respectively.
Thus, at a given aH2O, the values on the red and blue
curves indicate the average voltage that will be observed
between 0 ≤ xMg ≤ 0.25 and 0.25 ≤ xMg ≤ 0.5. The
equations on the voltage curves indicate changes in the
structural H2O content of the Xerogel, as Mg is inserted.
For example, “0.5 ↔ 1” on the blue line for aH2O ∼ 10−1
(wet electrolyte) indicates a variation in nH2O from 0.5 to
1 as xMg increases from 0.25 to 0.5. The slope changes of
the voltage curves, particularly the ones at high Mg con-
centration (blue line), indicate the critical water content
in the electrolyte at which the H2O co-intercalation be-
havior changes. The merging of the red and blue curves
in the superdry region in Figure 3 reﬂects that only a
single voltage plateau for 0 ≤ xMg ≤ 0.5 is found. The
interpretation of the kink on the blue voltage curve ob-
served in the superdry region is given in the SI.

Although Mg intercalation experiments in Xerogel-
V2O5 are normally performed on structures with higher
H2O and Mg content than considered in our structural
model,36–38,63 the calculated voltage curves in Figure 3
qualitatively agree with the experimental voltage features
for Mg insertion in wet,40 and dry electrolytes.36 The cal-
culated voltage for the superdry electrolyte (∼ 2.47 V,
aH2O ∼ 10−8), where the H2O exits the Xerogel dur-
ing Mg cycling, is higher but comparable to α-V2O5 at
low Mg concentrations (∼ 2.44 V).31 Importantly, the
increase in voltages with increase in aH2O, as predicted
by theory (Figure 3), is in good agreement with experi-
mental observations of higher initial voltages in aqueous
(voltage peak at ∼ 3.02 V) compared to dry (peak at
∼ 2.88 V) electrolytes and α-MgxV2O5 (∼ 2.35 V, no
water).34,36,40

VI. DISCUSSION

In this work, we have used ﬁrst-principles meth-
ods based on DFT to investigate Mg intercalation into
Xerogel-V2O5. Speciﬁcally, we have clariﬁed the struc-
ture of the Xerogel, evaluated the phase diagrams for
Mg intercalation under diﬀerent electrolytic conditions
(wet, dry and superdry), and calculated the average volt-
ages for each case. The data presented in this work
not only sheds light on existing experiments in the Mg-
Xerogel system, with possible Mg-H2O co-intercalation,
but also provides a working model for studying solvent
co-intercalation properties in layered materials for bat-
teries and other applications.
Figure 4 displays a phase diagram of the Xerogel
V2O5 − Magnesiated Xerogel V2O5 − H2O ternary sys-
tem, summarizing the results of Figure 2. The base of the
triangle (Figure 4) corresponds to Mg intercalation in the
Xerogel-V2O5 structure in the absence of H2O, or the su-

5

perdry electrolyte, as indicated by the green arrow. The
colored solid lines on the phase diagram represent the
trajectories of stable phases that will form upon mag-
nesiation of the Xerogel-V2O5 structure under diﬀerent
electrolyte conditions. While the solid blue and red lines
correspond to the wet and the dry electrolytes respec-
tively, the purple line indicates the commonality of the
stable phases between wet and dry electrolytes at low Mg
concentrations. The blue and red circles are the stable
states at full magnesiation in a wet and dry electrolyte,
respectively. The purple circle indicates the half magne-
siated − half hydrated ground state common to both the
wet and dry electrolytes.

While initial Mg intercalation up to xMg = 0.25 pulls
H2O into the structure for both wet and dry electrolytes,
further co-intercalation of water with Mg depends more
sensitively on the water content of the electrolyte. Inter-
estingly, the presence of water in the electrolyte changes
the phase behavior of the Mg-Xerogel system from that
of a two phase reaction at a single voltage (superdry) to
one with a capacity over a range of voltages (wet and
dry).

In conventional secondary batteries, where the sol-
vent or electrolyte do not co-intercalate with the redox-
active cation, the voltage depends on the chemical po-
tential diﬀerence of the cation species between the cath-
ode and the anode.64,65 However, our study suggests that
the measured voltages are subjected to change if the
co-intercalation of the solvent/electrolyte with the re-
dox ion occurs, leading to a co-dependence on the sol-
vent/electrolyte chemical potential. As illustrated by
Figure 3, the Mg insertion voltage in the Xerogel is cal-
culated to be ∼ 150 mV higher in a wet electrolyte than
in a dry electrolyte (aH2O ∼ 10−4), in good agreement
with reported higher voltages in aqueous compared to
organic (dry) electrolytes.36,38,40,41 Electrolyte/solvent-
dependent voltages give rise to important design conse-
quences in a battery system, since the voltage generated
can be calibrated based on both the solvent polarity (po-
lar/apolar) and the quantity (wet/dry) of the intercalat-
ing solvent species. Further analysis on the variability
of voltages based on solvents is relevant not only in the
design of improved electrolytes but also in selecting possi-
ble electrolyte-additive combinations that can ultimately
improve the energy density of an electrochemical system.
H2O co-intercalation in Xerogel-V2O5 has three im-
portant technological consequences: i) higher Mg inser-
tion voltages, ii) change in phase behavior from a two
phase regime (superdry) to one with intermediate sta-
ble Mg concentrations (wet, dry) and iii) higher kinetic
rate of Mg insertion originating from the electrostatic
shielding eﬀect of the coordinating water molecules in
the cathode.15,16 Nevertheless, in the case of Mg-ion bat-
teries, where the Mg metal anode is crucial to achieve
energy densities higher than current Li-ion technology,25
the presence of H2O in the electrolyte or coordinated
with the Mg2+ ions could cause passivation at the Mg
anode.28,66,67 While there exist solvents that successfully

metal (e.g., ethers like tetrahydrofuran and glymes29), it
is crucial to understand their fate as a co-intercalant to-
gether with the Mg in the bilayered-V2O5 structure, and
their impact on the Mg insertion voltage and mobility.
More generally, investigations of solvent co-intercalation
properties in other layered materials will be useful and
important in designing the next generation of recharge-
able Li, Na and multi-valent batteries.

trolyte, ranging from full co-intercalation in wet to none
in superdry conditions. Also, we have established the
signiﬁcant impact of water (or solvent) co-intercalation
on the voltages and voltage proﬁles obtained.
