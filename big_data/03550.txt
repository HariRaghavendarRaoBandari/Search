Abstract. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) contains perturbations that are close
to Gaussian and isotropic. This means that its information content, in the sense of the
ability to constrain cosmological models, is closely related to the number of modes probed in
CMB power spectra. Rather than making forecasts for speciﬁc experimental setups, here we
take a more pedagogical approach and ask how much information we can extract from the
CMB if we are only limited by sample variance. We show that, compared with temperature
measurements, the addition of E-mode polarization doubles the number of modes available
out to a ﬁxed maximum multipole, provided that all of the T T , T E, and EE power spectra
are measured. However, the situation in terms of constraints on particular parameters is
more complicated, as we illustrate. We also discuss the enhancements in information that
can come from adding B-mode polarization and gravitational lensing. We show how well one
could ever determine the basic cosmological parameters from CMB data compared with what
has been achieved with Planck, which has already probed a substantial fraction of the T T
information. Lastly, we look at constraints on neutrino mass as a speciﬁc example of how
lensing information improves future prospects beyond the current 6-parameter model.

Introduction

Planck [1], the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP [2]), the Atacama Cosmol-
ogy Telescope (ACT [3]), the South Pole Experiment (SPT [4]) and other cosmic microwave
background (CMB) experiments have measured the CMB with high sensitivity, covering an-
gular scales from essentially the whole sky down to the arcminute regime [5]. It is well known
that the precision with which these measurements are made (together with an understand-
ing of the physics generating the anisotropies) allows us to place very tight constraints on
cosmological parameters. A large number of studies have focused on predicting how well the
parameters can be constrained using existing or future CMB data [6–15]. In this paper we
want to take a rather more global view, and ask just how much constraining power there is
to be mined, or in other words, how much cosmological information there is to extract from
the CMB anisotropies. This will lead us to address questions like:

• How is the overall information content related to the number of CMB modes measured?
• What does polarization add to temperature information?
• How do power spectrum measurements relate to constraints on parameters?
• Is the information ﬁnite, and how far have we progressed towards the goal of measuring

all that is available?
The basic 2015 Planck data set (including fairly conservative masking of the sky, as
well as ﬁtting of foreground signals) gives a temperature power spectrum that is measured
to approximately 750 σ and polarization-related power spectra that are measured to around
280 σ [1]. We might therefore naively expect that there is about 800 σ worth of constraints to
be shared out among the cosmological parameters. However, a check of the Planck-derived
constraints shows that this same data set yields a value for 100θ∗ (a parameterization of the
ratio of the sound horizon to the last-scattering surface distance) that is 1.04103±0.00046 [16],
which corresponds to an almost 2300 σ measurement of θ∗. At the same time, the constraints
on the other ﬁve parameters in the usual set give a quadrature sum of about 120 σ (which is
fairly negligible compared to the θ∗ constraint).

The original motivation for this paper was to ask “how is it that an 800 σ measurement
of anisotropy power leads to a roughly 2300 σ combined constraint on cosmological parame-
ters?” In attempting to answer this question, we hope to illuminate some issues concerning
cosmological parameter constraints in general, and how they might relate to experimental
design in the future.

In this paper we focus on the conventional cosmological-constant-dominated cold dark
matter model, ΛCDM, and a standard 6-parameter set of cosmological parameters: As, the
amplitude of the initial power spectrum; ns, the power-law slope of the initial conditions;
Ωbh2, the baryonic density; Ωch2, the cold dark matter density; θ∗, which we have already
deﬁned; and τ, the optical depth to reionization. Here h is the Hubble parameter today, H0,
in units of 100 km s−1 Mpc−1. Within this model we use the code CAMB [17] to calculate CMB
power spectra.

2 CMB anisotropy information

The word “information” has many diﬀerent meanings. Here, we use the word to mean the
strength of our ability to constrain cosmologies. The total amount of information available

– 2 –

for cosmological surveys is related to the number of observable modes [18, 19]. This situation
has been described in many papers related to measuring the 3-dimensional power spectrum
in order to constrain cosmological parameters [20–24].

The situation for CMB temperature anisotropies is simpler, since it only involves assess-
ing the information content of a purely 2-dimensional sky. On the other hand, as we shall
see the relationship between the modes and the constraints on cosmological parameters is
non-trivial.

Let us start by recalling that the temperature ﬁeld T (θ, φ) on the sky is usually expanded

in terms of spherical harmonics, i.e.,

∞(cid:88)

+(cid:96)(cid:88)

m=−(cid:96)

(cid:96)=2

a(cid:96)mY(cid:96)m(θ, φ),

(2.1)

T (θ, φ) =

where we have removed the monopole (average CMB temperature) and dipole (which is
dominated by our local velocity). Then, provided one goes to suﬃciently high multipoles,
and ignoring eﬀects of beams and masking, one can use the set of a(cid:96)ms as an alternative
representation of the pixels in the map. The power spectrum C(cid:96) is the expectation value of
the variance of the a(cid:96)ms as a function of (cid:96), with each m being equivalent since there are no
cosmologically preferred directions.

If the perturbations are Gaussian then each sky is a realization of this power spectrum.
The scatter among these realizations is known as “cosmic variance.” The cosmic variance in
estimates of the C(cid:96)s on the full sky is

(cid:115)

∆C(cid:96) =

2

(2(cid:96) + 1)

C(cid:96)

(2.2)

(e.g., Ref. [25]). The factor of 2 here is because this is eﬀectively the “variance of the variance,”
and for a Gaussian distribution that is twice the variance. The factor of (2(cid:96)+1) is the number
of m modes for each (cid:96) and if only a fraction fsky is observed, then the approximate eﬀect is
to increase the uncertainty in C(cid:96) so that the “sample variance” is f−1
sky larger [26]. A more
realistic expression can also be written that includes the instrumental noise and beam, as
described in Ref. [27].

For the simple case of an all-sky, noise-free experiment, which measures multipoles per-

fectly up to (cid:96)max, the total square of the signal-to-noise ratio (using Eq. 2.2) is

(S/N )2 ≡ (cid:96)max(cid:88)
(cid:104)

(cid:96)=2

(cid:96)max(cid:88)

(C(cid:96)/∆C(cid:96))2 =

1
2
(cid:96)max((cid:96)max + 2) − 3

(2(cid:96) + 1)

=

Note that this calculation is exactly half the total number of modes, i.e., (cid:80)(2(cid:96) + 1). This

(2.3)

means that in terms of constraints on the power spectrum, each a(cid:96)m mode contributes 1/2 to
the square of the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In other words, estimating the information
in the power spectrum is eﬀectively the same thing as counting modes.

To be clear, we are distinguishing here between trivial information that tells us about
the particular realization of our Universe (which we can continue to measure as precisely as
we wish) and the more valuable information we can extract from our Hubble patch, which

– 3 –

gives us constraints on the background cosmological model. The fact that the CMB sky is
remarkably close to Gaussian allows us to reduce the information contained in the individual
a(cid:96)ms (or equivalently in the particular hot and cold spots on our sky) to estimates of the power
at each (cid:96) (or equivalently the variance among pixels as a function of angular separation). For
Gaussian skies, the amount of information in the power spectrum is directly proportional to
the number of independent modes that can be measured.

Certainly one could regard all the data in a map as being “information,” i.e., the fact that
there is a CMB hot spot in a particular direction is of some consequence, just as it matters that
we live in the Milky Way galaxy, rather than M31. However, we discount these particulars
about our realization, since they do not tell us about our overall cosmological model. So
here, when we say “information,” we are referring to the constraining power for cosmological
models, or more speciﬁcally the signal-to-noise ratio. Clearly there is a relationship between
this “information” and the amount of computer memory required to store the related data,
i.e., the number of bits needed. In a more formal information theoretical sense, the number
of bits required corresponds to the base 2 logarithm of what we are deﬁning as information
(e.g., Ref. [28]) – but here we are talking about signal-to-noise ratio for power spectra, since
that is where parameter constraints come from.

For the case of the CMB each a(cid:96)m is a random number coming from a Gaussian distri-
bution, with mean zero and variance C(cid:96). To estimate the C(cid:96) from a set of observed a(cid:96)ms, it
is suﬃcient to have only a very few bits of information for each a(cid:96)m, since we only need each
a(cid:96)m to help us obtain an estimate of the variance. Hence the amount of cosmological infor-
mation – i.e., the ability to eventually constrain parameters – is determined by the number
of measurable modes times a (roughly) constant (but parameterization dependent) numerical
factor. However, for a particular parameter it may be that some modes are more important
than others; to understand how the information of power spectra maps onto the information
of the cosmological model, we can perform a more rigorous calculation by considering the
Fisher matrix, as we do in the following sections.

3 CMB Fisher information

The previous section considered CMB temperature anisotropies only, but since the CMB sky
can be linearly polarized, there exists additional information in each pixel of a CMB map.
If an experiment can measure the Q and U Stokes parameters (in addition to T ), then in
principle there are two additional pieces of information for each pixel. The most useful way
of describing these additional degrees of freedom is through a geometrical approach, deﬁning
a divergence-like combination, usually called “E,” and a curl-like combination, usually called
“B” [29–31]. T , E, and B ﬁelds can be used to determine auto- and cross-power spectra, and
with parity considerations (at least for cosmological signals) making T B and EB uncorrelated,
we are left with four CMB power spectra from which we can constrain parameters, namely
CT T

, CT E
The T - and E-mode maps have now been well measured [32–38], but estimates of B-
modes are still in their infancy [39]. Moreover, even when primordial B-modes become de-
tectable, we expect them to be small, and hence one will need an experiment with an entirely
diﬀerent sensitivity range to probe the information contained in those modes. For these rea-
sons we will neglect B-modes in most of the discussion of this paper. However, the B-modes
caused by the eﬀects of gravitational lensing have now been detected by several experiments
[38, 40–44], and we will discuss this later in Section 4.

Focusing only on T and E, an important fact is that the two ﬁelds on the sky are not
independent, but contain correlations, which can be measured through the cross-power spec-
trum CT E
. Because of this, it may not be entirely obvious how much additional information
is provided by measurements of CMB polarization – does a measurement of T and E provide
twice as much information as provided by each of them alone? We will answer this question
in the following subsections.

(cid:96)

3.1 The Fisher matrix
The Fisher matrix gives a powerful formalism for describing the information content coming
from observables in terms of underlying parameters (see e.g., Ref. [45]). Under the assumption
of Gaussian perturbations and with negligible instrumental noise, the Fisher information
matrix for CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies is [46]

extend Eq. (3.1) to include them.

which will explain the eﬀects of correlations between parameters.

Let us ﬁrst consider the case in which only the CMB temperature is mapped, i.e., we have
not measured Q and U in this scenario. If we focus on a single parameter p, then the SNR
can be written as

(3.6)

where we sum over all the multipoles (cid:96). For the temperature power spectrum alone, then the

(3.9)

Hence we see that in the simple case of a single parameter that is proportional to the amplitude
of the power spectrum, the constraining power on this parameter from the T T power spectrum
is the same as the mode counting presented in the previous section.

Things are more complicated when we consider general parameters. Figure 1 shows the
squared SNR per multipole for the six parameters of the standard ΛCDM model following
Eq. (3.7), i.e., with all other parameters held ﬁxed.1 The red curves in each panel show the
T T -only case. We can see many details from this curve, illustrating how diﬀerent multipole
ranges aﬀect constraints on each parameter.

Variations due to the parameter As are similar to those we have described for a “scaling
parameter,” but not quite the same. If we looked at the T T spectrum without the eﬀects
of gravitational lensing, then we would ﬁnd that the spectrum scales exactly like Ase−2τ ,
and hence this is the scaling parameter we referred to in Eq. (3.7). Since for Fig. 1 all of the
parameters are held ﬁxed except each one individually, then both As and e−2τ serve eﬀectively
as scaling parameters in the sense of Eq. (3.7). Because of this, the curve for τ looks like the
(cid:96) /d ln τ = −2τ), except for an extra variation at
one for As, multiplied by 4τ 2 (since d ln CT T
the lowest (cid:96)s. When we include lensing in the usual way (as we have done in Fig. 1) then
there are also small wiggles in the As curve, which come from the smoothing eﬀect of lensing
on the peaks and troughs.
For the slope, ns, we see the eﬀect of the “pivot” point at k = 0.05 Mpc−1, which projects
to (cid:96) (cid:39) 550 for T T ; at multipoles around this point there is no constraint on ns. The variations
for most of the other parameters reﬂect the structure of the C(cid:96)s themselves. For example, for

1Gaussianity is not a valid assumption for the low multipoles, and hence the low-(cid:96) part of the plots should

be taken as approximate estimates only.

– 7 –

θ∗ the curve goes to zero near the positions of peaks and troughs (because the gradient of C(cid:96)
is zero there).

The As panel in Figure 1 can serve as a guideline for inferring the sensitivity of a C(cid:96)
to a particular parameter. One can approximately deﬁne the dependency of C(cid:96) to a generic
parameter p, by a polynomial as C(cid:96) ∝ pα, with α = 1 then representing linear dependence,
and we might speak of “less than linear” and “non-linear” as corresponding to α < 1 and
α > 1, respectively. Comparing each of the panels of Figure 1 with As, shows that the set
{Ωbh2, Ωch2, τ} all have a less than linear relation with the C(cid:96)s at (cid:96) (cid:46) 30, while ns exhibits
a non-linear relationship. The parameter θ∗ is non-linear over almost the entire multipole
range (note the diﬀerent y-axis range for this panel). In the high-(cid:96) region, (cid:96) > 30, all of the
parameters (except θ∗) show a mildly less than linear relation, with oscillations close to zero
at some multipoles (and this is even true for θ∗), while ns has a close to linear relation at
(cid:96) (cid:38) 1500.

We will discuss the blue and green (EE and T E) curves in the following subsections.

3.3 EE only

Now consider the situation where only the E-modes are mapped, and hence we only have
access to the EE power spectrum for constraining cosmology. Here the situation is clearly
exactly the same as it was for the T T -only case.

We have the squared SNR for a single parameter p being

Again, the result is just what we expect from mode counting. If we have polarization data
out to some (cid:96)max, then it provides the same constraints on a scaling parameter as having
temperature data out to the same (cid:96)max.

The situation for more general parameters is presented by the blue curves in the panels of
Figure 1. One can see several eﬀects that are similar to the T T case. The situation for As and
τ are essentially the same as for the T T case, with dramatic improvement for τ at low (cid:96) because
of the sensitivity of large-scale polarization to reionization. The constraining power for ns
also has a zero in the EE case, but the pivot k0 projects to a slightly diﬀerent (cid:96) (reﬂecting
the slightly diﬀerent scales with which polarization is sourced compared to temperature). For
the parameters θ∗, Ωbh2, and Ωch2 we see that the constraining power from EE is generally
higher than that for T T (as recently pointed out in Ref. [15] and explained in the next section).
This illustrates the improved parameter constraints from polarization, essentially because of
the sharper acoustic features in polarization.

3.4 TE correlation only

Now let us examine the case where we measure the T E power spectrum only. This is clearly
not a realistic situation, but evaluating it will elucidate some interesting points. The Fisher

For a general parameter p there can be a diﬀerent situation than we saw for T T and

The ﬁrst thing to notice is that in the limit of full correlation the information in T E is directly
given by the information content of T T and EE, as expected. However, we also see that even
in the case of a vanishing r(cid:96), there is still information to be obtained from measuring T E
(this is because the SNR does not vanish as r(cid:96) → 0). This will depend on the behaviour of
the parameter p and speciﬁcally on how r(cid:96) varies as the parameter changes. For a scaling
parameter the information content of T E vanishes when r(cid:96) vanishes, but this is not true in
general.

Details of the parameter SNR2 values per multipole are shown in Figure 1, with the
green curves being for the T E case. Once again, the As panel is helpful in here because we
can see that the dramatic drops in the green curve correspond to the points with r(cid:96) = 0.
Checking the green curve value of these locations at other panels, such as θ∗, reveals that
one gains information by measuring T E even if r(cid:96) = 0 at a speciﬁc angular scale (e.g., see
Figure 1 just below (cid:96) = 1000).

The T E curves are usually lower than the T T and EE curves, simply because the T - and
E-modes are only partially correlated. This is manifested particularly strongly in the τ panel
of Figure 1, where it is clear that T E is much less sensitive to the reionization bump than
EE. However, we see that T E can be higher in some multipole ranges for some parameters,
particularly for Ωbh2 and Ωch2. For example, T E is more sensitive to Ωbh2 than T T in the
range 670 (cid:46) (cid:96) (cid:46) 1920 and more sensitive than EE in the range 810 (cid:46) (cid:96) (cid:46) 1830. In fact
Ref. [15] already pointed out that T E can constrain Ωch2 better than T T by around 15 % –
this would be hard to determine directly from Figure 1, since the ﬁgure does not account for
correlations among parameters (although this is something we do consider in Section 5).

3.5 TT and EE power spectra, no correlation
We would like to understand the basic way that polarization information combines with
temperature information. So let us now consider the simple (although hypothetical) situation
in which we have mapped out E-mode polarization, but when this polarization is uncorrelated
with temperature anisotropies. Under these conditions the covariance matrix of Eq. (3.3) takes
on a simple 2× 2 form. In this case it is easy to verify that the information is exactly doubled
compared with the temperature-only case:

i.e., we obtain a factor of
2 improvement over the temperature-only case. This makes
sense, because uncorrelated E-mode polarization is adding precisely one additional piece of
information for every pixel on the sky, or equivalently, is adding an independent set of aE

modes to the aT

(cid:96)m modes.

3.6 TT and EE correlated, but ignoring TE
The situation in the previous subsection is of course not realistic, because in reality there is
a T E correlation in the CMB anisotropies, and hence there are three distinct power spectra
to determine, CT T

To see how this works, let us ﬁrst of all imagine that although the temperature and
polarization ﬁelds are correlated, we have not measured this correlation (we are imagining
an impractical scenario here where the cosmologist has been careless and ignored T E). We
will again treat the simple case of a scaling parameter. If we just use the 2 × 2 matrix in the

temperature and polarization and is therefore the same as the temperature-only case. On the

as high as 60 %. We also plot 1− M as a function of (cid:96)max; this eﬀectively shows the amount of
information that would be lost by neglecting the T E cross-correlation power spectrum. The
plot shows that this can be as much as 20 %, but for high (cid:96)max is a little under 10 %.

which is similar to the result of the previous section, with M = 1. Therefore, measurements
to some (cid:96)max of the full T T , EE, and T E spectrum have exactly twice as much information as
a temperature-only (or polarization-only) experiment. In appendix A we give a conceptually
simpler derivation of this same result, by transforming to ﬁelds that are uncorrelated by
construction.

In appendix A we present an interpretation of the contributions to the total SNR, which come
from temperature (uncorrelated with polarization), polarization (uncorrelated with tempera-
ture), and the correlation itself, θ(cid:96) (deﬁned in Eq. A.3). Equation 3.32, however allows us to
consider the situation at a scale (cid:96) for which r(cid:96) = 0. In this case we obtain

where the ﬁnal term is given by 4 times Eq. (3.15). We see here (somewhat surprisingly) that
the T E correlation will contribute information even when r(cid:96) = 0, provided that dr(cid:96)/dp (cid:54)= 0.
While Eqs. (3.32) and (A.12) are complete descriptions of the contributions to the in-
formation content of a single arbitrary parameter, they do not contain the details of how
multiple parameters are constrained or how parameter correlations are involved, which we
consider in Section 5.

3.8 Total SNR for a single parameter
To complete this section, let us be more explicit, and give a quantitative example. For a
cosmic-variance-limited experiment up to (cid:96)max = 3000 and covering the entire sky, the total
signal-to-noise ratio in a single scaling parameter is S/N (cid:39) 2100. And if we add E-mode
polarization information, also cosmic-variance-limited to the same (cid:96), we obtain S/N (cid:39) 3000.
An experiment that makes ideal measurements of T and E out to some (cid:96)max has precisely
twice as much information (i.e., constraining power for a scaling parameter) as a T -only
experiment, provided that all of T T , EE, and T E are measured. A parameter with more
complicated C(cid:96) dependence, like θ∗ for example, will have more information from EE due to
its stronger contrast between peaks and troughs. Such a parameter will also have part of its
constraint coming from how the correlation itself changes (an eﬀect that cannot be seen with
a simple scaling parameter).

In terms of constraints on speciﬁc parameters, we know that the situation is more compli-
cated still. For example, polarization data are important for breaking particular degeneracies
[47, 48] (especially for determining the reionization optical depth, τ), and so polarization may
constrain some parameters much better than expected for simply twice as much information.
We have already seen this presented in Figure 1 In Section 5 we will focus on several ΛCDM
parameters and how their correlations aﬀect parameter constraints.

4 Additional CMB information

Before investigating parameter dependence in detail, it is worth noting that some other infor-
mation that could come from the CMB, in addition to the three power spectra we have been
considering.

– 13 –

If one could measure BB to the same (cid:96)max then instead of the full T T + T E + EE
measurement giving twice as many modes as come from T T alone, we would now have 3
times as many modes. In practice we expect primordial B-modes to be quite weak, and it is
extremely unlikely that we could measure this power spectrum beyond the ﬁrst few hundred
multipoles (e.g., Ref. [49]). Hence B-modes are never going to add substantially to the mode
count. On the other hand, any measurement of primordial B-modes would provide a direct
constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that would be better than the indirect constraints from
other power spectra. Hence (as is well known) the constraints on this additional parameter
are dramatically improved through better B-mode experiments.

We have been assuming that the CMB sky contains Gaussian perturbations, but we know
that this cannot be exactly true. Certainly there is hope that we may one day detect non-
Gaussianity from higher-order correlations in the CMB (e.g., Ref. [50]), and here polarization
oﬀers the promise of pushing the uncertainties down. However, we do not expect such a signal
to give a very high SNR (at least compared to the power spectra), since the CMB is clearly
very close to Gaussian.

(cid:96)

One exception to this is that the 4-point function of the CMB sky contains correlations
from the eﬀects of gravitational lensing. This signature allows us to estimate an additional
L , which has already been done to SNR (cid:39) 40 by Planck [43]. If we could
power spectrum, Cφφ
measure this power spectrum to the same maximum multipole as for the temperature and
polarization power spectra, then it would add the same number of modes again. However,
things are not so simple, because the index L for lensing comes from the coupling of modes
at diﬀerent scales, and hence making a noise-free temperature map out to (cid:96)max will not
give a cosmic variance limited measurement of Cφφ
L to L = (cid:96)max. But putting that aside,
lensing will add eﬀectively as many modes as temperature and polarization. Hence there is in
principle
3 times as much information contained in a full CMB mapping experiment (plus
.
some additional information from B-modes) as there is in a measurement purely of CT T
On the other hand, in terms of parameter constraints, the lensing power spectrum has little
dependence on cosmological parameters other than amplitude [51, 52].

√

Since φ is a Gaussian random ﬁeld, its power spectrum has the same statistical properties
as the T or E maps. Therefore, adding lensing to the covariance matrix is similar to adding
EE or T E to T T . One could also consider adding the information coming from lensed B-
modes – but then one would have to account for the fact that these modes are not Gaussian
(since they come from a convolution of E-modes with lensing φ-modes [53]). However, the
addition of lensed B-modes provides little to no improvement on parameters if E-modes and
lensing φ-modes are already accounted for. The reason is an intuitive one: the lensed B-
modes come directly from unlensed E-modes and φ-modes. Thus adding B-modes simply
double counts some combination of the E- and φ-modes (albeit at diﬀerent scales). Thus
adding the lensed B-modes only helps in the noise-dominated case. In Section 5.3 we consider
including lensing φ-modes to our data vector (Eq. 3.1); for the reasons stated above we do
not simultaneously consider lensed B-modes.

5 CMB parameter information

5.1 Relationship with overall SNR
We now discuss the connection between the information in the power spectra and the con-
straints on the 6-parameters of the standard ΛCDM model. One might expect the total SNR
in (cid:96)-space to be very crudely of order the SNR in the parameter space; however, in detail we

– 14 –

do not expect them to be the same. This is due to the degeneracies between parameters and
the sensitivity of subsets of the data to changes in speciﬁc parameters, as well as the impor-
tant fact that the power spectra do not depend linearly on the parameters, as was discussed
already (see Figure 1).

Figure 3. Top: ratio of the total SNR2 in parameters to that in the power spectra for a cosmic-
variance-limited experiment. Note that this quantity is independent of the sky coverage. The red line
shows the results of a temperature-only experiment, the blue line is for a polarization-only experiment,
and the green line shows the results for both temperature and polarization combined. The parameter
set here consists of {Ωbh2, Ωch2, θ∗, τ, As, ns}. Bottom: same as the top panel, except that H0 has been
used as a parameter in place of θ∗, i.e., the parameter set here consists of {Ωbh2, Ωch2, h, τ, As, ns}.

One can think of the Np-dimensional parameter space as a data compression scheme.
This compression reduces the (cid:96) measured power spectrum values and their uncertainties into
Np numbers and their corresponding uncertainties. The power spectra depend linearly on the
parameter As (apart from small lensing eﬀects), and hence if that was the only parameter,
then its SNR would be the same as the SNR for the power spectra, and hence would be the
same as the mode counting exercise discussed in the section 3. However, other parameters
are not “linear” in this sense, and hence can be constrained better or worse than seen for the
simple case of As.

s as a parameter instead of As, then
the SNR would be better by a factor of 2. A more dramatic change will come from considering
ln As rather than As. And in general the standard parameters aﬀect the power spectra in
ways that are fairly diﬀerent from those of a scaling parameter. The most non-linear of the
parameters is θ∗, as was already discussed, since fairly small changes in θ∗ can result in large
changes to the power spectra, because of the relative sharpness of the adiabatic peaks and
troughs. The best way to understand the constraints on parameters in general is to use
the Fisher matrix to investigate what happens for the standard 6-parameter cosmology. In
general, however, we should not be surprised to ﬁnd that the SNR values for some cosmological
parameters only diﬀer by factors of order unity from those of a linearly scaling parameter.

A comparison of the total SNR in parameters with the total SNR in the power spectra
is shown in Figure 3. Here the error bars for each parameter are derived from a Fisher matrix
calculation, assuming a noise-free experiment with sample variance only, with sky coverage of
50 % (picked to approximately match that of Planck). The ﬁducial model used for the Fisher
matrix calculation is ΛCDM with parameters equal to the best-ﬁt values of the Planck-2015
“TT+lowTEB+lensing” combination [16]. The total SNR in parameter pi is

(5.1)

and Eq. 2.3 (including an fsky = 0.5 factor) is used to calculate the total SNR in power
spectra.

Figure 3 (top panel) shows that the total SNR2 in parameters can be a factor of as
much as 100 larger than the total SNR2 in the power spectra. However, this number is highly
dependent on the set of parameters that are chosen and can vary dramatically, e.g., if θ∗
is replaced by H0, as plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 3. The ratio of the total SNR
in parameters to the SNR in the power spectra (temperature and polarization) is close to
unity when H0 is substituted for θ∗. This suggests that the combination of parameters in the
bottom panel of Figure 3 is more “linearly” related to the power spectra than the set in the
top panel. The behaviour seen in this ﬁgure explains the observation made in Section 1 that
the SNR on θ∗ from Planck exceeds the total SNR in the T T power spectrum.

One can learn more about parameter constraints by looking more closely at Figure 3.
Firstly, the relatively poor constraints on the 6-parameter set at low multipoles is a result
of parameter degeneracies, which are not broken until higher multipole data are included.
Secondly, we see that adding polarization data makes a substantial improvement to the overall
constraint on parameters. The more dramatic improvement in the total constraint (green
lines in the ﬁgure) at low multipoles is a result of the well-known ability of CMB polarization
data to break the Ase−2τ degeneracy. Thirdly, the polarization data on their own are more
constraining (for the same (cid:96)max) than the temperature data; this arises essentially because the
polarization power spectra are “sharper” than for CT T
, as has been stressed in other studies
(e.g., Ref. [15]). We also see structure in these SNR curves that clearly reﬂects the shape of
the C(cid:96)s; we shall discuss this further in the next section.

(cid:96)

5.2 Parameter constraints from power spectra
Although the SNR in the power spectra gets eﬀectively shared out among the parameters,
as we have seen this is only very crudely correct, and in practice the detailed constraints on
the parameters will change based on many factors. In particular the parameter constraints

– 16 –

will depend on which power spectra are used, which multipole range is measured, and what
set of parameters was chosen in the ﬁrst place. We need to appreciate that some information
is special for particular parameters, e.g., large-angle polarization for τ; thus we should focus
on the (cid:96)-range that is important for each parameter. We now describe this connection more
comprehensively by showing some examples and comparing with the current uncertainties. It
is important to realize that we are not intending here to make forecasts for speciﬁc experiments
(with particular assumptions about beamsize, noise, foreground contamination, etc.), since
this has been done before.
Instead we are asking the more general question of how good
the parameter constraints could ever become, by comparing the ideal values with current
constraints from Planck.

Figure 4. Cumulative Fisher forecast calculations for the six parameters of the standard ΛCDM
model for a noise-free experiment with fsky = 0.5. The red line is for a temperature-only experiment,
the blue line is for pure polarization, and the green line is for the full power spectra (T T , T E, and
EE). The error bars for each parameter are compared with the Planck-2015 “TT+lowTEB+lensing”

temperature peak positions, while the dashed lines are for temperature troughs. Note that the peaks

EE spectrum.

a temperature-only experiment, while the blue and green lines are for polarization-only and

with the Planck-2015 “TT+lowTEB+lensing” 68 % conﬁdence limits. The vertical solid and

the same as the E-polarization troughs and peaks [36].

sky

The mode-counting argument (of Section 2) tells us that every a(cid:96)m has equal weight
for contributing to the SNR of the power spectrum, but, as we have seen, this is not true
for the parameter SNR, since the C(cid:96)s are not equal in delivering constraints on individual
parameters. For example, while the multipoles around the third T T trough, (cid:96) (cid:39) 900–1100,
are particularly useful for reducing the uncertainty on Ωch2, the information gain from the
(cid:96) (cid:39) 1300–1650 range (from the fourth T T peak to the ﬁfth trough) is almost negligible.

A careful examination of Figure 4 shows that in general the T T troughs are more impor-
tant than the peaks for reducing the error bars (particularly clear when focusing on As and τ,
for example). We also see (in the green lines) that when we add temperature to polarization
the curves are much smoother. This is because the eﬀects coming from the troughs and peaks
of T T more or less cancel with the eﬀects coming from the troughs and peaks of EE.

But there is still the issue to explain of why the T T troughs, which are obviously lower
than the peaks, and therefore (one might expect) carry less information, should give stronger
constraints. By comparing Figure 4 with Figure 5 – which shows the same predictions but
with lensing eﬀects turned oﬀ – one can see that the reason for the importance of the troughs
is the eﬀect of lensing on the T T spectrum. The explanation is that since lensing smooths
the peaks and troughs, while preserving total power, then the relative change from lensing
is larger around the troughs than around the peaks, and hence the troughs can give better
constraints on parameters.
Comparing Figure 4 with Figure 5 also shows that while the lensing of the power spectra
is useful for breaking the As–τ degeneracy, it makes the constraints on the set {θ∗, Ωch2, Ωbh2}
weaker. This is because the peaks and troughs are “sharper” in the unlensed spectra, and are
therefore a better source of information for constraining θ∗. The uncertainties on the matter
densities are also improved as a result of the better constraints on θ∗ and the correlations
among the parameters.

What we have highlighted here is the simple observation that constraints on cosmological
parameters come from two basic factors: the ﬁrst is having power spectra that are sensitive to
changes in parameters (see Eq. 3.32 and Figure 1); the second is the ability for power spectra
to break degeneracies between parameters. In the following subsection we will consider the
eﬀect of adding lensing φ-modes, which generally have weak dependence on cosmological
parameters. Nevertheless, these modes can break parameter degeneracies, which is crucial for
going beyond the 6-parameter model.

5.3 Extended parameters – neutrino mass
We will now choose a speciﬁc example to illustrate how we can think about the relation-
ship between information and parameter constraints. Future CMB observations will target
extensions to the 6-parameter ΛCDM model. In particular, the detection of the sum of the
masses of the neutrino species seems like a realistic (although challenging) possibility in the

ature only, the blue line for polarization only, and the green line for the full T T , T E, and EE spectra.
The y-axis here is the ratio of the uncertainty on each parameter compared with the Planck-2015
“TT+lowTEB+lensing” 68 % conﬁdence limits, at diﬀerent maximum multipoles. The vertical lines

near future [54–56], since the current upper limit on mtot
[16] is only a factor of a few higher
ν
than the 0.06 eV limit imposed by direct measurements of mass diﬀerences (e.g., Ref. [57]).
However, the left panel of Figure 6 shows that such a measurement is not feasible with CMB
temperature or polarization maps alone, because there is not enough information in the power
spectra out to (cid:96) (cid:39) 3000.

Besides the temperature and polarization ﬂuctuations, one can also map the ﬂuctuations
of the gravitational potential or, equivalently, the lensing deﬂection angle. Inclusion of the
lensing power spectrum in the Fisher formalism is discussed in Ref. [58], assuming Gaussian-
ity and ignoring correlations between diﬀerent multipoles. Making similar assumptions, we
ﬁnd that CMB lensing can improve the constraints on the total neutrino mass dramatically,
as is shown in the right panel of Figure 6. Here we have assumed that the CMB lensing
power spectrum, Cφφ
, and its correlations with temperature and E-mode polarization can be

[58]).
Given these assumptions, the full set of CMB power spectra reaches the ﬁducial sensitivity
(corresponding to 60 meV in mass) at (cid:96) (cid:39) 1200,2 and can ultimately measure the mass at
about the 2 σ level. However, there is a very strong degeneracy between the neutrino mass
and the dark matter density (with a correlation coeﬃcient (cid:39) 0.95 at (cid:96)max = 2500), as well
as a fairly strong degeneracy between neutrino mass and ns (with a correlation coeﬃcient
of (cid:39) 0.73). Hence, any additional independent measurement of these parameters – e.g., via
galaxy weak lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations, or redshift space distortions – that can
break these degeneracies will lead to substantial improvement.

compares the results of T T , EE, and the total (T T +T E +EE). The right panel compares the results
for T T + T E + EE with the case when CMB lensing (including cross-power spectra) is also added. It
is assumed here that the CMB lensing spectra can be measured up to the sample variance limit for
fsky = 0.5. The ﬁducial neutrino density used here is Ωνh2 = 0.00064, which corresponds to 60 meV
in mass.

6 Discussion

In terms of mode-counting, the information contained in the CMB anisotropies is clearly
ﬁnite, because it is limited by cosmic variance and the fact that the power spectra damp
at the highest multipoles. For temperature information alone the total SNR in the power

spectrum is ∼(cid:112)fsky/2 (cid:96)max. Planck has measured most of what is available out to (cid:96) (cid:39) 2000,

with ACT and SPT continuing that out to higher (cid:96), but over relatively small fsky, and with
foregrounds making it seem unrealistic to push beyond (cid:96) (cid:39) 3000, say. This means that
although we can continue to measure our CMB sky to ever more sensitive levels, we have
already reached a point where the bulk of the useful information has already been extracted
from the temperature anisotropies.

However, the situation is diﬀerent for polarization information, since the foregrounds
(from galaxies and clusters of galaxies) are very weakly polarized, and hence there is hope
that we should be able to measure the primary polarization anisotropies to much higher

2Here we are using the same multipole symbol, (cid:96), for lensing and temperature or polarization.

at least an order of magnitude more polarization information to extract from the CMB sky.
Moreover, as we have seen, the polarization data can place tighter constraints on parameters in
general, and on some parameters in particular. The BB and φφ power spectra add additional
information, but in practice this is probably a small fraction of what is available from the T -
and E-modes.

Despite the dramatic improvement still expected from CMB polarization, the maximal
SNR in the CMB power spectra is (cid:46) 104 from primary CMB anisotropies. To improve
cosmological parameter constraints we therefore need to go to 3-dimensional surveys (such as
high-z 21-cm ﬂuctuations) where there are considerably more modes [19]. As an illustration
of what this CMB limitation means, let us consider the determination of the curvature of
space, ΩK. The cosmic variance limit is at the 10−5 level, since this is the amplitude of the
curvature perturbation on the Hubble scale [60]. The current uncertainty from CMB data is
at the 10−2 level, and given the above argument, we expect this to only decrease by about
another order of magnitude. Hence, assuming that the Universe is suﬃciently close to being
spatially ﬂat, then we will never be able to determine whether it is ﬂat or curved using CMB
data alone – there is simply not enough information for us to achieve the required SNR level
on ΩK from CMB anisotropies. Ambitious future experiments may probe >∼ 1012 3D modes,
which would in fact allow us to reach below the cosmic-variance limit for the measurement of
ΩK within our observable volume.

The discussion here has focused on the Gaussian primary anisotropies, supplemented
by CMB lensing. However, we should acknowledge that there is also some cosmological
information content in the secondary anisotropies (i.e., cosmic IR background, integrated
Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect, Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀects, etc.). These eﬀects certainly enable further
cosmological information to be measured, not just on the last-scattering surface, but also at
other epochs along the light cone. Nevertheless the additional information seems limited in its
scope for constraining background parameters, because either there is only a modest amount
of information available at all (like in the ISW eﬀect), or the additional information is still
eﬀectively on a 2D surface. The only way to obtain a dramatic improvement in constraining
power will be to pursue methods that are fundamentally 3D.

7 Conclusions

We have taken a pedagogical approach to investigating the information content in CMB
anisotropies, in the sense of constraining the cosmological model. It is clear that for temper-
ature anisotropies, we have already mined a substantial part of what is available, and we are
eﬀectively running out of information. However, for CMB polarization we still have a way to
go, and there may be an order of magnitude more constraining power still to extract from
the CMB sky.

The CMB T T power spectrum has an SNR of approximately(cid:112)fsky/2 (cid:96)max, which can be

thought of as a simple mode-counting calculation. The SNR on a scaling parameter (like As) is
the same, while some parameters (such as θ∗) have a dependence which is “non-linear,” hence
allowing them to be constrained more tightly than the total SNR for the power spectrum as
a whole.

We have shown that the mapping from information about the CMB power spectra to
information about the cosmological parameters has two ingredients, namely the sensitivity of
the power spectra to parameters (Eq. 3.32 and Figure 1), and the ability to break parameter

– 21 –

degeneracies (Figures 4–6). The latter concept will likely become more important as we
explore further data sets to constrain cosmology within and beyond the 6-parameter ΛCDM
paradigm.

√

Temperature and polarization anisotropies are correlated, and hence T E contains infor-
mation that enhances what is there from T T and EE alone. A full measurement of T T , EE,
and T E yields one additional quantity per pixel in the map (compared with just measuring
T ), and hence a total SNR that is
2 times bigger than for T T alone. In addition to gain-
ing back the information lost due to the T E correlation, when one measures all three power
spectra one can also obtains additional information about how the correlation itself changes
(most easily seen in Eq. A.12–A.13). In fact the information gained from the correlation can
sometimes be greater than that from temperature (Ref. [15]) or polarization (Figure 1) alone.
Adding B-modes could in principle give one more quantity for each pixel, although
in practice the primordial signal is expected to be weak. On the other hand CMB lensing
provides an additional map of φ, which provides a whole other set of modes that can be used
to constrain parameters. For the standard ΛCDM model lensing helps to break the As–τ
degeneracy, but for extensions to the standard model (e.g., with neutrino mass included as
an additional parameter) these data could be even more useful in future.

Constraints from the CMB will continue to improve as we measure more modes from
polarization and from lensing. There is certainly a bright near-term future ahead as these
measurements move towards being sample-variance-limited to small angular scales. In the
longer term future there will be other secondary signals extractable from CMB measurements,
but ultimately, to dramatically increase the number of modes probed, one will need to go to
other observables (such as redshifted 21-cm maps), which can provide 3D surveys of our past
light cone.

A Decorrelating T and E

√

As an alternative to the derivation of total CMB information content in Section 3, one can
deﬁne new variables that are uncorrelated, so that the covariance matrix becomes diagonal.
Doing this makes it clear that the improvement in SNR from including E-mode polarization
information is exactly
2, regardless of how T and E are correlated. The change in adding
B-modes is then trivial (since they are uncorrelated with either T or E). The approach we
describe here is for any two correlated data sets, the speciﬁc example will be temperature and
polarization data. Whether they are lensed or not does not change the arguments, although
the addition of lensing data themselves would require a generalization of the method to deal
with the associated correlations.

Note that there are alternative approaches to decorrelating T and E, e.g., by leaving T
unaltered, while removing the correlated part from E [61]; the approach we describe here is
easy to picture as a rotation. The covariance matrix for these new power spectra can simply
be derived by computing the 4-point functions of t and e. However, a much simpler method
is to take the previous covariance matrix (i.e., C) and make the following replacements:
CT T → λT T ; CEE → λEE; and CT E → 0. The covariance and inverse covariance matrices
then become

The interpretation of the terms on the right-hand side is quite clear: the ﬁrst two are the

So we see, as we found in Section 3.7, that depending on the parameter p, there is extra
information to be found from the correlation itself, even if CT E

(cid:96) = 0.

B The fully correlated case

Note that the Fisher formalism we have employed in this paper relies on the covariance matrix
being invertible.
In a realistic experiment this is not an issue, because, regardless of the
true correlation between modes, noise will regularize the problem, such that the covariance
will always be invertible. Additionally, on physical grounds, it is clear that we need not

(cid:96) = 1, when there is no new information from E (and hence the mode count appears to be

(cid:96) → 1). Clearly this situation is hypothetical and hence should not unduly

concern us.
However, there is a similar case where we would have a singular covariance and that is
the case of E-modes, lensing, and lensed B-modes. It is apparent that the lensed B-modes
are completely determined by E-modes and lensing modes, φ. Therefore we can simply ask
what there is to be gained from actually measuring the B-modes. The answer is that (in
principle) there is nothing gained in this measurement! This is true if we assume that a
perfect measurement of E, B, and φ can be performed. From an experimental point of view
this will never really be true, due to the presence of noise (i.e., one can always hope to
beat down the noise in lensed B-modes by actually measuring them). Of course the Fisher-
formalism assumes the model to be correct, so from a theoretical point of view (and looking
beyond standard ΛCDM), measuring lensed B-modes will of course always have merit.
