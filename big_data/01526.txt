We present a numerical study of the many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon within an anisotropic
Heisenberg model with random local ﬁelds. Taking the dynamical spin conductivity σ(ω) as the test case,
we show that ﬁnite-size statistical ﬂuctuations of σ(ω) spectra scale differently for the anisotropy ∆ = 0,
corresponding to the standard Anderson localization, than for the general interacting case ∆ > 0. Except for
the extreme MBL case, numerical results allow for the extraction of the low-ω dependence of the conductivity.
Results for the d.c. value σ0 indicate the crossover into the MBL regime, i.e. an exponential-like variation with
the disorder strength W , while the low-frequency exponent in the crossover regime is α ∼ 1.

The phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL) has
been originally suggested for weak disorders [1, 2], arguing
that interacting systems may exhibit a mobility edge separat-
ing low-energy many-body (MB) localized states from delo-
calized ones. In this respect, there is a clear analogy with the
single particle spectrum that characterizes the Anderson lo-
calization [3–5]. For the localization in noninteracting (NI)
systems the essential ingredient is the phase coherence of
single-particle states. However, the latter becomes lost in
an interacting system due to the scattering among particles.
This makes a proof of the existence of the mobility edge dif-
ﬁcult for models with interaction and most studies concen-
trate on the large disorder limit for which all the MB states
are expected to be localized (for a recent overview and refer-
ences see, e.g., Ref. [6]). Numerical solutions of ﬁnite one-
dimensional (1D) MB quantum systems [7–9] indicate that
in interacting fermion systems strong disorder can effectively
induce the MBL phase. The latter has been characterized by
several novel features: a) The absence of the d.c.
transport
(and in particular of the d.c. conductivity) at any temperature
T [6, 9, 10], b) the Poissonian level statistics in contrast to the
Wigner-Dyson one in generic interacting systems [7, 11–13],
c) generally nonergodic behavior [11, 14–17] and the exis-
tence of conserved local quantities [18, 19], d) a discontinuty
in the one-particle occupation [20], and e) a very slow (loga-
rithmic) growth of the entanglement entropy [21–25] as well
as of the energy upon driving [26, 27]. Besides the theoret-
ical curiosity there are also experimentally relevant systems,
in particular cold atoms in optical lattices, where the MBL
physics has been studied [28, 29], while it might be relevant
also in real materials, e.g., with random spin chains [30].

While the above characteristics appear to be established
deep inside the MBL phase, there evidently remain open ques-
tions. In particular, it is a challenge to establish whether the
transition between the (normal) ergodic and the MBL regime
is a well-deﬁned phase transition [2, 8, 12, 19, 23–25, 31] with
a possible mobility edge in the energy (temperature) spec-
trum [2, 13], or merely a crossover [32]. Closely related is

the proper understanding of the statistical ﬂuctuations of rel-
evant observables when evaluated for ﬁnite systems. While
due to random nature of disorder the Gaussian deviations are
expected in ergodic systems, anomalous Grifﬁths-like statisti-
cal distribution has been claimed within the regime between
the ergodic and the MBL phase [6, 10]. It is quite plausible
that such statistical properties also affect the meaning of cal-
culated dynamical quantities, e.g., the dynamical conductivity
σ(ω) as the most studied one. In the context of the MBL the
most interesting is the d.c. value σ0 = σ(ω → 0) and the
low-frequency behavior,

σ(ω) ∼ σ0 + ζ|ω|α,

(1)

where α ≤ 2 is a nontrivial exponent discussed in sev-
eral studies [6, 10, 33]. Our aim is to clarify properties of
σ(ω) in the intermediate regime between the ergodic and the
MBL phase and for this purpose also to investigate sample-
to-sample ﬂuctuations of σ(ω) in the search for anomalous
behavior indicating distinct phases.

Model and dynamical conductivity. As the MBL prototype
model we consider the 1D anisotropic Heisenberg model with
random local ﬁelds [6, 10, 21, 33, 34],

Periodic boundary conditions are assumed. The model (2) is

fermions with random onsite energies hi, as investigated by
number of authors [7–9, 12, 32]. We use J = 1 as the unit
of energy, while for local random ﬁelds hi we take the uni-
form probability distribution P (|hi| < W/2) = 1/W , being
standard in most studies.

tions of the sample-averaged σ(ω) and its sample-to-sample
ﬂuctuations we use two numerical methods, based on the ex-
act diagonalization (ED). In both of them we restrict our anal-
ysis to the subsector Sz
tot = 0, i.e. the system without a uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst one is the full ED allowing
up to Nst ∼ 104, with eigenvalues/vectors found for each
of Nd samples with random hi. We reach L ≤ 16 and use
Nd ∼ 100. In the special case of ∆ = 0, Eq. (2) transforms
into the (Anderson) model of NI spinless fermions [3–5]. We
solve the latter by the ED within the single-particle basis for
large systems, typically L ∼ 1.6 × 104 sites.

The majority of

the results are obtained via the
microcanonical-Lanczos method (MCLM) [32, 34, 35], best
suited for dynamical quantities at elevated T > 1. Its com-
putational requirements are essentially equivalent to the ones
for the ground-state Lanczos ED, but with an increased num-
ber of Lanczos steps M, in order to improve the frequency
resolution δω. We are able to obtain results for L = 28,
Nst ∼ 4 × 107 and M ∼ 104, where M determines the reso-
lution as δω ∼ L/M. The latter being in our studies typically
δω ∼ 2 × 10−3 > δ. Here δ is the characteristic MB level
separation (e.g., δ ∼ 10−3 for L = 16, and δ ∼ 10−6 for
L = 28). Raw spectra are broadened with Gaussians charac-
terized by the frequency width η. We assume that the calcu-
lated σ(ω) has a macroscopic meaning provided that η > δ,
while for smaller η results become dominated by ﬁnite-size
and level-statistics effects. E.g., for ω <∼ δ, any level repul-
sion necessarily affects frequency dependencies.

Before discussing more delicate issues, we present in Fig. 1
gross results of sample-averaged σ(ω) for the NI (∆ = 0) and
the interacting ∆ = 1 case, respectively, for various disorders
W = 2 − 8, with the resolution ﬁxed to η ∼ 4 × 10−3. For
large W we note that general features are very similar in both
cases [6, 32, 33], e.g., with the location of maxima at ω ∼
1. Essential differences between the two cases occur for low
ω (cid:28) 1. While for ∆ = 0 there is a clear drop towards σ0 = 0
for all W , for ∆ = 1 we ﬁnd a rather broad regime in which
σ(ω) follows the low-ω behavior in Eq. (1), with σ0 > 0 and
α ∼ 1 [32, 34]. This behavior will be elaborated further on.
Fluctuations. To validate the interpretation of sample-
averaged σ(ω), we discuss ﬁrst its relative sample-to-sample
ﬂuctuations,

in Fig. 1) essentially η and
L independent. Still, by varying η and L and by calculating
rη(ω) important information on the MBL physics can be ob-
tained.

Let us start with a coarse-grained description of spectra
η (ω), where η characterizes the frequency bin. Using the
σk
deﬁnition Eq. (4) for rη, we presume that rη is a slowly
varying function within the frequency scale of our interest,
δ (cid:28) η (cid:28) 1. For values of σk
η (ω) that are fully random
between neighboring bins, the lack of correlation leads to a
simple scaling of rη upon increasing the bin-width η → nη

n. Additionally, localization divides the sys-
and rnη = rη/
tem into K = L/l∗
N I independent sections, and therefore the
contribution to each bin in Eq. (3) is given by K independent
variables (spectra), which directly yields self-averaging, i.e.

for the NI ∆ = 0 system in which rη = b(ω)/

are due to ﬁnite number of used realizations).

Spectral correlations spreading over nξ neighboring bins
In particular, upon
change the scaling properties of rη.
increasing the bin-width η → nη one then gets rnη ∝

(cid:112)nξ/n rη. Furthermore, it is clear that for nξ >∼ n all values

η (ω) within the large bin nη remain correlated, behaving
of σk
as a single random variable, rnη ∼ rη. In connection to the
latter behavior, we turn our discussion to properties of rη(ω)
for interacting systems with ∆ = 1, shown in Fig. 3. As
seen in Fig. 3b,c (with the exception of ω → 0 behavior for
W > 6) the interacting case is (similarly as the NI case) char-
acterized by a weak frequency dependence of rη(ω). In con-
trast to the NI case, Fig. 2, however, one observes in Fig. 3c,d
a fundamental difference in the scaling with η. E.g. for ﬁnite
ω = 0.2, as shown in Fig. 3d, rη does not exhibit any signiﬁ-
cant dependence on η over multiple scales, 0.002 ≤ η ≤ 0.1.
This is partly the case also for ω ∼ 0 in Fig. 3c, except well
in the MBL regime W > 6, where ﬂuctuations rη(0) become
larger due to very small (or vanishing) σ0.

ments, m2l =(cid:82) ∞

At present we cannot give a detailed explanation for the
spectral correlations, emerging in the interacting ∆ > 0 case
and leading to correlated bins nξ (cid:29) 1. Still, an evident argu-
ment regarding the role of interaction ∆ > 0 can be given in
terms of frequency moments of σ(ω). For T → ∞, these mo-
−∞ ω2lσ(ω)dω, can be obtained analytically
for L → ∞ assuming the grandcanonical distribution (taking
the sum over all Sz
tot sectors). In particular, one obtains for
arbitrary conﬁguration of hi,

where w = W/(J∆). For large disorder w (cid:29) 1, the contri-
bution to the ﬂuctuations in Eq. (6), associated with the inter-
action ∆, becomes small. It is plausible that higher cumulants
C2l have similar behavior. The crucial difference is that for
the NI (w = ∞) systems there is no dimensionless parameter
which would control ﬂuctuations in Eq. (6), justifying the NI
scaling as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, for ∆ (cid:54)= 0 a new
ﬁnite frequency scale ∆ω > 0 sets in, which is determined by
w and represents the frequency correlations in single-sample
η (ω), leading to η-independent spectra for η < ∆ω. Spec-
σk
tral correlations are also well visible in our numerical results
for interacting ∆ > 0 (not presented). Still, the actual form of
∆ω(w) remains to be understood.

Averaged dynamical conductivity. We now turn to the av-
eraged σ(ω), which are supposed to have macroscopic va-
lidity provided that ﬂuctuations discussed above are modest,
rη(ω) < 1. The central quantity is the d.c. σ0, shown as
function of W in Fig. 4a for L = 28 and η = 0.002. In the
crossover regime 2 ≤ W ≤ 8, two curves for ∆ = 0.5, 1
in Fig. 4a follow qualitatively an exponential dependence,
σ0 ∝ exp(−cW ), where c plausibly increases as the inter-
action ∆ is decreased, consistent with the fact of vanishing σ0
for the NI ∆ = 0 case [32]. While the mean value of σ0 ap-
parently behaves smoothly, relative ﬂuctuations become very
large well within the MBL regime, i.e. rη(0) > 1 (see error
bars Fig. 4a) for W > 6, where we can only give an upper
bound for σ0.
The low-ω exponent α, deﬁned by Eq. (1), is ﬁtted in
Fig. 4b within the window 0 ≤ ω ≤ 0.2, taking into the ac-
count that σ0 can be ﬁnite, unlike in some other studies [6, 10].

son) and the interacting ∆ > 0 systems. The latter ∆ > 0
ﬂuctuations are much smaller, being independent of η, with
the exception of the ω → 0 limit well within the MBL regime
W > 6. This means that even for ﬁnite (small) size sys-
tems the single-sample σk(ω) are rather smooth functions,
provided that one considers variations beyond the level spac-
ing η > δ ∝ exp(−ζL). This property may be qualitatively
understood considering the frequency moments, as given in
Eqs. (6), and consequently attributed to the correlations in
σk(ω) spectra over the characteristic frequency scale ∆ω or
over nξ (cid:29) 1 neighboring frequency bins. However, deep
in the MBL regime W (cid:29) 8, ﬂuctuations may increase over
rη(ω) > 1 for system sizes considered here. In this case, av-
erages may loose their meaning, in particular for ω ∼ 0, in the
analogy to the Grifﬁths-phase arguments [6].

Regarding the nature of the transition into the MBL phase,
our results indicate a crossover rather than a phase transition
at a well-deﬁned critical W = Wc(∆). That is, we observe a
continuously vanishing of σ0 with increasing W . This behav-
ior is qualitatively compatible with a previous result (within
the t-V model) of the steady increase of σ0 ∝ ∆ at ﬁxed
W and ∆ ≤ 0.5 [32]. To establish possibly ﬁnite σ0 > 0
deeper within the MBL phase W > 6 becomes exceedingly
difﬁcult due ﬁnite-size and frequency-resolution effects. Yet,
due to the observed quasi-exponential dependence on W , the
crossover manifests itself quite sharply and so the location of
Wc(∆) in the phase diagram according to our present results
appears quite consistent with previous studies [6–9, 15, 33].

Finally, we comment the results for the exponent α, deﬁned
by Eq. (1). Our ﬁndings that α ∼ 1 in the ergodic regime,
agrees with some previous and recent studies [32–34], indi-
cating an anomalous diffusive transport. In some other con-
texts such a behavior has been traced back to the long-time-
tail phenomena related to the notrivial coupling between hy-
drodynamic modes [37]. However, the origin of such anoma-
lous dynamics in the considered model remains to be clariﬁed.
Moreover, we ﬁnd α ∼ 1 even for W > Wc [33]. Such α in-
dicates that we are dealing with an insulator with anomalous

dielectric susceptibility χ0 = (cid:82) dωσ(ω)/ω2. The latter one

would diverge for σ0 = 0 but α = 1 (even more for even-
tual α < 1), at least within the linear response theory. It has
been recently found that such an anomaly within the MBL
regime might remain valid beyond the linear response [27].
At least our results seem to be far from predicted ’normal’ in-
sulating behavior α ∼ 2, but we should add a caution that the
frequently claimed limiting behavior [4, 6] is hardly observ-
able even within the NI case, as shown in Fig. 5, although the
NI and interacting results are expected to merge in the limit
W (cid:29) Wc(∆).

for the system of L = 16000 sites. The ﬁt is given by σ(ω) ∝
ω2 ln2(b/ω), with b ∼ 1.37.

The standard deviation of α due to sample ﬂuctuations, de-
noted by the error bars, is increasing with W and 1/∆. Still it
should be pointed out, that large relative ﬂuctuations of σ0 do
not affect directly the uncertainty of α. It seems that α ∼ 1
represents a typical behavior, present in a broad range of W in
Fig. 4b. The trend towards larger α > 1 [6] could be observed
only well within the MBL regime W > 6 [33]. According to
the predictions of the Anderson localization [4, 6], one expects
that α → 2 for W (cid:29) 1. In order to show the validity of the
latter, we present in Fig. 5 result obtained for the NI system
with W = 4 and L = 16000 sites. Indeed, the numerical data
can be described by the NI formula, σN I (ω) ∝ ω2 ln2(b/ω).
However, due to quite large b > 1, the simpliﬁed power law
with α = 2 is restricted to very small ω (cid:28) 0.1. Taking into
account that the same result (obtained for very L (cid:29) 100) can
be in larger window reasonably ﬁtted also with α = 1, this
puts some caveats into the interpretation of the above ﬁts with
α ∼ 1 within the MBL regime.

Conclusions. Our results as shown e.g. in Fig. 1, reveal the
fact that general features of σ(ω) for large disorders W > 4
are similar irrespective of the interaction (anisotropy) ∆. That
is, for W (cid:29) 1 ∆ > 0 spectra do not differ from the one
with ∆ = 0. This suggests that a very short (single-particle)
localization length l∗ ∼ 1 in this regime suppresses to a large
extent the MB effects, induced by ∆ > 0. The corrections
due to ∆ > 0 are clearly visible in frequency moments, e.g.
in m2, Eq. (5). In general, however, the ∆ > 0 case is highly
nontrivial [14, 36]. Still, we can speculate on the existence
of a characteristic frequency scale ω < ∆ω, below which the
interaction ∆ (cid:54)= 0 qualitatively changes σ(ω), whereas ∆ω is
vanishing with increasing W at ﬁxed ∆.

When discussing sample-to-sample ﬂuctuations, we should
keep in mind that σ(ω) is a global property. Variations of local
quantities, as e.g. local spin dynamical correlations S(ω) [30],
may be much larger (involving short system segments), even
to the point of a lack of self-averaging in the MBL regime.
