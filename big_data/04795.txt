A YANG-MILLS FIELD ON THE EXTREMAL

REISSNER-NORDSTR ¨OM BLACK HOLE

PIOTR BIZO ´N AND MICHA(cid:32)L KAHL

Abstract. We consider a spherically symmetric (magnetic) SU (2) Yang-
Mills ﬁeld propagating on the exterior of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr¨om
black hole. Taking advantage of the conformal symmetry, we reduce
the problem to the study of the Yang-Mills equation in a geodesically
complete spacetime with two asymptotically ﬂat ends. We prove the
existence of inﬁnitely many static solutions (two of which are found in
closed form) and determine the spectrum of their linear perturbations
and quasinormal modes. Finally, using the hyperboloidal approach to
the initial value problem, we describe the process of relaxation to the
static endstates of evolution for various initial data.

1. Introduction and setup

The global dynamics of a Yang-Mills ﬁeld propagating in a four-dimensional

Minkowski spacetime is well understood: all solutions starting from smooth
initial data at t = 0 remain smooth for all times [1] and decay to zero
as t → ±∞ [2, 3]. The global-in-time regularity holds true in any glob-
ally hyperbolic four-dimensional curved spacetime [4], however the phase
portrait can be richer due to existence of nontrivial stationary solutions
which play the role unstable attractors, as was shown for the Schwarzschild
background [5].

In this paper we consider the evolution of a Yang-Mills ﬁeld on the exterior
of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole. Our study is motivated by
the expectation that an interplay between the conformal structure of the
extremal Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole and the conformal invariance of
the Yang-Mills equations may lead to an interesting behaviour of solutions.
This is a continuation of our studies of how the dissipation-by-dispersion
phenomena, responsible for the relaxation to a stationary equilibrium in
extended Hamiltonian systems, depend on the geometry of the underlying
spacetime [6, 7].

The exterior (i.e., the domain of outer communication) of the extremal
Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole is a globally hyperbolic static spacetime

Hereafter, for typographical convenience we use the abbreviation C = C(x) =

trast to (M, ˆg), the spacetime (M, g) is geodesically complete. It has two
asymptotically ﬂat ends at x = ±∞ (see Fig. 1). Asymptotic ﬂatness is
easily seen in terms of the coordinate ρ = C 2(x) for which we have

We consider an SU (2) Yang-Mills ﬁeld propagating in the spacetime
(M, g). The gauge potential Aµ = Aa
µτa takes values in the Lie algebra
su(2), where the generators τa satisfy [τa, τb] = iabcτc.
In terms of the
Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength Fµν = ∇µAν − ∇νAµ + [Aµ, Aν], the lagrangian
density reads

L = Tr(cid:0)FαβFµνgαµgβν(cid:1)(cid:113)−det(gµν).

In four dimensions the quantity gαµgβν(cid:112)−det(gµν) is invariant under a

conformal transformation gµν (cid:55)→ Ω2gµν, hence if Aµ solves the Yang-Mills
equations in one metric, so does it in any conformally related metric. Taking
advantage of this conformal invariance of the Yang-Mills equations, in the
following we consider only the spacetime (M, g).

(6)

For the Yang-Mills potential we assume the spherically symmetric purely

magnetic ansatz

A = W (τ, x) ω + τ3 cos ϑdϕ , where ω = τ1dϑ + τ2 sin ϑ dϕ ,

(7)

which gives

F = ∂τ W dτ ∧ ω + ∂xW dx ∧ ω − (1 − W 2) τ3 dϑ ∧ sin ϑ dϕ .

(8)
Note that the vacuum is given by W = ±1, while W = 0 corresponds to
the magnetic monopole with unit charge. Inserting the ansatz (8) into (6)
we get the reduced lagrangian density

We know from Chru´sciel and Shatah [4] that solutions of Eq.(10) starting
at τ = 0 from smooth initial data remain smooth for all future times. The
goal of this paper is to describe their asymptotic behaviour for τ → ∞. For
physical reasons our analysis is restricted to solutions with ﬁnite (conserved)

Due to dissipation of energy by dispersion, such solutions are expected to
settle down to critical points of the potential energy, i.e. static solutions of
Eq.(10).

2. Static solutions

Time-independent solutions W = W (x) of Eq.(10) satisfy the ordinary dif-
ferential equation

W (cid:48) + W (1 − W 2) = 0 .

We claim that, besides the constant solution W0 = 1, Eq.(12) has a count-
able family of smooth ﬁnite energy solutions Wn(x) (n ∈ N) with the fol-
lowing properties (which, not very surprisingly, bear remarkable similarities
to the Bartnik-McKinnon solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills equations [9]):

• Wn(x) has n zeros,
• |Wn(x)| < 1 for all ﬁnite x and lim|x|→∞ |Wn(x)| = 1,
• Wn(x) is an even (resp. odd) function for even (resp. odd) n,
• As n → ∞, Wn(x) tend pointwise to W∞ = 0 for any ﬁnite x.

The proof of existence of solutions Wn and their properties is a straight-
forward adaptation of the proof given in [10] in the case of harmonic maps
between 3-spheres (which satisfy the same equation as (12) with the non-
linearity sin(2W ) instead of W (1 − W 2)). Key to the proof is the fact
that Eq.(12) is asymptotically autonomous with the limiting equations for
x → ±∞, W (cid:48)(cid:48)∓ W (cid:48) + W (1− W 2) = 0, having saddle points at W = ±1 and
a spiral at W = 0 (stable at −∞ and unstable at +∞). Using a shooting
method one can show that there exist inﬁnitely many homoclinic and hete-
roclinic orbits connecting the saddle points. The solutions are parametrized
by the coeﬃcients of the stable directions of the saddle points

Wn(x) = 1 − ane−x + O(e−3x).

(13)

We refer the interested reader to [10] for the details. Note that due to the
reﬂection symmetry W (cid:55)→ −W , each solution Wn has a copy −Wn. We
adopt the convention that Wn(∞) = 1. The parameters and energies of
the ﬁrst few solutions are given in Table 1 and their proﬁles are depicted in
Fig. 2.

We turn now to the linear stability analysis of the static solutions Wn(x).
This analysis is essential in understanding the role these solutions may play
in the evolution. Following the standard procedure, we substitute W (τ, x) =
Wn(x) + δW (τ, x) into Eq.(10), linearize and separate the time dependence
δW (τ, x) = eλτ v(x). This yields the eigenvalue problem1

Note that due to the reﬂection symmetry x → −x, the eigenfunctions are
alternately even and odd. We denote them by v(n)
k (x) and the corresponding
eigenvalues by −(λ(n)
k )2 (k ∈ N). We claim that the operator Ln has ex-
actly n negative eigenvalues. For n = 0 this is evident because the potential
in (15) is everywhere positive. For n = ∞ this follows from the fact that
the λ = 0 solution is oscillating at inﬁnity. For any ﬁnite n ≥ 1, one can
obtain a lower bound as follows. Consider the function un(x) := W (cid:48)
n(x).
Diﬀerentiating Eq.(12), one ﬁnds that

˜Ln un = 0 , where

˜Ln = Ln +

by dy/dx = C 2(x), Eq.(15) takes the form of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation
− d2v
dy2 + Vn(x(y))v(y) = −λ2v(y), however this form is not very helpful because the
function x(y) is given only implicitly.

By construction un(x) has (n − 1) zeros, hence from the Sturm oscillation
theorem it follows that the operator ˜Ln has exactly (n − 1) negative eigen-
values. Consequently, the operator Ln, which is the exponentially localized
negative perturbation of ˜Ln, has a least (n− 1) + 1 = n negative eigenvalues
(where ’+1’ stands for the zero eigenvalue of ˜Ln going negative). Numerics
(see Table 2) shows that this lower bound is sharp but it seems hard to
prove this fact rigorously for general n. In the case n = 1, non-existence
of the second negative eigenvalue follows by the Sturm oscillation theorem
from an easy to prove fact that the odd solution solution of Eq.(15) with
λ = 0 is monotone.

3. Hyperboloidal formulation

We will use the method of hyperboloidal foliations and Scri-ﬁxing as de-
veloped by Zengino˘glu [11] on the basis of concepts introduced by Friedrich
[12]. To implement this method we deﬁne a new time coordinate

s = τ − 1
2

(cosh x + ln(2 cosh x))

(17)

and foliate the spacetime by hyperboloidal hypersurfaces Σs of constant s.
These are spacelike hypersurfaces that approach the ’left’ future null inﬁnity
along outgoing null cones of constant advanced time v = τ + 1
2(sinh x + x)
and the ’right’ future null inﬁnity along outgoing null cones of constant
retarded time u = τ − 1

2(sinh x + x). To see this, note that

There is plenty of freedom in choosing a hyperboloidal foliation; the par-
ticular choice (17) is motivated by computational convenience. In terms of
the coordinates (s, x), Eq.(10) takes the form2

is the Bondi-type energy. The formula (21) expresses the radiative loss of
energy through the future null inﬁnities. Since the energy E(s) is posi-
tive and monotone decreasing, it has a nonnegative limit for s → ∞. For
this reason the hyperboloidal formulation is very natural in analyzing re-
laxation processes that are due to the dispersive dissipation of energy. In
the remainder of the paper we describe in detail the convergence to one of
the static solutions Wn(z). We focus our attention on the ﬁrst two static
solutions W0 and W1 because, as follows from the linear stability analysis
in section 2, only these solutions may participate in the evolution of generic
and codimension-one initial data.

2We slightly abuse notation and use the same letter for the function W (τ, x) and any

other function obtained from it by changing the variables.

We return now to the linear perturbation analysis and compute the quasi-

normal modes for W0 and W1. Substituting

W (s, z) = Wn(z) + (1 + z2)λ/2eλsu(z)

into (19) and linearizing, we obtain the quadratic eigenvalue problem (the
purpose of the factor (1 + z2)λ/2 is to simplify the resulting equation)

(23)
We shall compute the quasinormal modes for the ﬁrst two static solutions
W0 = 1 and W1 = z using Leaver’s method3 [14]. We seek solutions in the
form of a power series around the ordinary point z = 0

(cid:88)

u(z) =

ajzj .

(24)

j=0

This series converges for |z| < 1. The discrete values of λ for which the
function deﬁned by the series (24) is analytic at z = ±1 correspond to the
eigenvalues (for real λ > 0) and quasinormal modes (for (cid:60)(λ) < 0). To ﬁnd
those values we need to determine the asymptotics of the coeﬃcients aj for
large j. To this end we substitute the series (24) into Eq.(23) for n = 0, 1
and get the three-term recurrence relation

α0 a2 + β0 a0 = 0 ,
α1 a3 + β1 a1 = 0 ,
αj aj+2 + βj aj + γj aj−2 = 0 ,

j ≥ 2

with

αj = j2 + 3j + 2 ,
βj = −2j2 − (6λ + 2)j − 4λ2 − 3λ + 4 − 12b2
0 ,
γj = j2 + (2λ − 1)j + λ2 − λ − 2 − 12b2
1 ,

where b0 and b1 are the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients of the Taylor expansion of Wn(z)
around z = 0. For n = 0 we have b0 = 1, b1 = 0 and for n = 1 we have b0 =
0, b1 = 1. Even modes satisfy the boundary condition u(0) = 1, u(cid:48)(0) = 0,
hence a0 = 1 and a1 = 0, while for odd modes we have u(0) = 0, u(cid:48)(0) = 1,
hence a0 = 0 and a1 = 1.
The recurrence relation (25) has two linearly independent asymptotic so-
lutions for j → ∞ (in the theory of ﬁnite diﬀerence equations, such solutions
are called Birkhoﬀ’s solutions, see Chapter 8.6 in [16])

(27)
The series (24) converges at z = ±1 if and only if the coeﬃcient of an
exponentially growing term in (27) vanishes. The corresponding solution is
then called a minimal solution of the recurrence relation and denoted amin

To ﬁnd the minimal solution we deﬁne

We solve this system numericaly using the method of lines with an 8th-order
ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme in space and 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration in
time. At the boundaries we use one-sided stencils. Note that there are
no ingoing characteristics at the boundaries, hence no boundary conditions
need, or can, be imposed.
As expected, for generic intial data the solution tends to one of the vac-
uum solutions ±W0. For intermediate times we observe ringdown along the
fundamental quasinormal mode, while for later times the polynomial tail is
seen to dominate (see Fig. 3).

If initial data are close to an unstable static solution, then for early times
we observe an exponentially fast departure from this solution along its prin-
cipal unstable mode. This behaviour, in the case of a small perturbation of
W∞, is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 4. Evolution of time-symmetric initial data W (0, z) =
10−8 exp(−16atanh2z) at a sample point z = 1
2 . For early times
we see the exponential growth along the principal unstable mode
around W∞ with the Lyapunov exponent λ(∞)
1 ≈ 0.73. After-
wards, the evolution proceeds as in Fig. 3.

Since parity is preserved in evolution, solutions starting from odd initial
data cannot tend to W0. Generically, odd solutions converge to W1 (whose
single unstable mode is even and therefore not excited). If we add a small
even admixture of size ε to odd initial data, then W1 appears as an in-

In all cases, the dynamics in the vicinity of static solutions is in excellent
quantitative agreement with the results of linear stability analysis displayed
in Tables 2 and 3.

Finally, we discuss the late time polynomial tails.

In contrast to the
ringdown, which is sensitive to the interior structure of the spacetime and
depends on the ﬁnal attractor, the tails for the Yang-Mills ﬁeld on an asymp-
totically ﬂat spacetime are universal. They decay as s−4 in the interior
(|z| < 1) and as s−2 along future null inﬁnities (z = ±1) [2, 3]. Moreover,
the spatial proﬁles of tails also appear to be universal. This can be seen by

(0.01 tan(z) − 10−24) exp(−16atanh2z) (black) and W (0, z) =

Initially, both solutions evolve together and ring down to W1
along its least damped odd quasinormal mode with frequency
λ ≈ −0.266 + 0.456i. Later, the solution with the small even
admixture departs towards W0 along the unstable mode of W1
with the Lyapunov exponent λ(1)

the following heuristic argument. Consider a solution tending asymptoti-
cally to W0. Substituting

W (s, z) = 1 + s−2f (y), where

y = s(1 − z),

into Eq.(19) and linearizing, we get

y(y + 1)f(cid:48)(cid:48) + (2y − 1)f(cid:48) − 2f = 0.

Discarding the growing solution, we obtain

into Eq.(19) and solving the resulting system of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions iteratively starting from c0(s) = ARs−2. The formula (41) reﬂects
the fact that the decay of the Yang-Mills ﬁeld is not uniform in space (be-
cause the decay along J + is slower than the decay in the interior) . By
the conformal invariance of the problem at hand, the formula (41) holds
for the derivatives of Yang-Mills ﬁeld at the future horizon of the extremal
Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole. This type of instability for solutions of the
wave equation on the extremal Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole was discov-
ered by Aretakis [17, 18] (see also [19] and [20] for a discussion of the rela-
tionship between the behavior of ﬁelds near the future (degenerate) horizon
and the future null inﬁnity).

The numerical evidence conﬁrming the proﬁle (39) and the growth of
higher derivatives along the future null inﬁnity (41) is shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

log-log scale) the transversal derivatives at J +

behaviour (s > 50) agrees with formula (41) for AR ≈ 0.1319.
