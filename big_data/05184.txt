ABSTRACT
We have derived estimators for the linear growth rate of density ﬂuctuations using the cross-
correlation function of voids and haloes in redshift space, both directly and in Fourier form. In
linear theory, this cross-correlation contains only monopole and quadrupole terms. At scales
greater than the void radius, this linear theory is a good match to voids traced out by haloes in
N-body simulations; small-scale random velocities are unimportant at these radii, only tending
to cause small and often negligible elongation of the redshift-space cross-correlation function
near its origin. By extracting the monopole and quadrupole from the cross-correlation func-
tion, we can measure the linear growth rate without prior knowledge of the void proﬁle or
velocity dispersion. We recover the linear growth parameter β to 9% precision from an effec-
tive volume of 3( h−1Gpc)3 using voids with radius greater than 25 h−1Mpc. Smaller voids
are predominantly sub-voids, which may be more sensitive to the random velocity dispersion;
in any case, they introduce noise and do not help to improve the measurement. Adding velocity
dispersion as a free parameter allows us to use information at radii as small as half of the void
radius. The precision on β is then reduced to approximately 5%, even when marginalising
over velocity dispersion. Contrary to the relatively simple redshift-space distortion patterns
in overdensities, our simulated voids show diverse shapes in redshift space, and can appear
either elongated or ﬂattened along the line of sight. This can be explained by the compet-
ing amplitudes of the local density contrast, plus the radial velocity proﬁle and its gradient,
with the latter two factors being determined by the cumulative density proﬁle of voids. The
distortion pattern is therefore determined solely by the void proﬁle and is inevitably differ-
ent for voids-in-clouds and voids-in-voids. This diversity of redshift-space void morphology
complicates measurements of the Alcock-Paczynski effect using voids.

2012; Valageas et al. 2013; Okumura et al. 2015); with care, it is
possible to recover the linear growth rate to 2% precision by in-
cluding this small-scale information (Reid et al. 2014). This aver-
age growth is extracted from the pairwise galaxy-galaxy correla-
tions, which sample peaks and troughs of the matter density ﬁeld;
it remains an open question, at least from the observational point
of view, how the growth of structure depends on the environment.
At a minimum, the growth of density perturbations is expected to
be more rapid in superclusters and lower in voids, simply because
these regions resemble universes with different cosmological pa-
rameters. The scales where such non-linear growth effects become
important will probably differ between different environments. But
the environmental dependence of the growth of structure may have
a more fundamental signiﬁcance, since it could encode informa-
tion about non-standard theories of gravity. Measurements for the
growth at different environment can thus be used as a test for de-
partures from Einstein gravity. As discussed below, such deviations

2

Cai et al.

are frequently expected to be stronger where the matter density is
low, which leads us to investigate the growth of structure in void
environments.

Cosmic voids are large underdense regions of the universe that
are devoid of galaxies. Voids in large-scale structure have great
potential in constraining cosmology and gravity via the following
observables: the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test (Alcock & Paczynski
1979; Lavaux & Wandelt 2012); stacking of voids for the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect (Sachs & Wolfe 1967; Granett et al.
2008; Cai et al. 2014a,b); weak lensing measurement of the mat-
ter distribution in voids (Higuchi et al. 2013; Krause et al. 2013;
Cai et al. 2015; Clampitt & Jain 2015; Gruen et al. 2015); void el-
lipticity as a probe for the dark energy equation of state (Lee & Park
2009; Bos et al. 2012); void density proﬁles and number counts
as a probe of modiﬁed gravity (Clampitt et al. 2013; Lam et al.
2015; Cai et al. 2015; Zivick et al. 2015; Barreira et al. 2015); cou-
pled dark energy (Pollina et al. 2015); the nature of dark matter
(Yang et al. 2015); and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in void clus-
tering (Kitaura et al. 2015; Liang et al. 2015).

The growth of structure around cosmic voids is fundamentally
related to the detailed understanding of some of these observables.
For example, the AP measurement using cosmic voids makes the
underlying assumption that stacked voids are of the same size in
both the transverse and line-of-sight (LOS) direction if the assumed
cosmology is correct – but this assumption is violated by redshift-
space distortions (Lavaux & Wandelt 2012; Sutter et al. 2014). The
effect of peculiar velocities on the observed conﬁguration of voids
must be understood in order to obtain unbiased cosmological AP
measurements. Another example is that the ISW signal associated
with cosmic voids is determined by the local growth rate, which is
affected by possibly nonlinear density and velocity structure.

We will focus here on extracting the growth rate around voids.
The void-mass (or void-galaxy) correlations in redshift space are
the tool we will employ for the measurement. We will follow
closely the methodology of conventional redshift-space distortion
analyses to derive the mapping between redshift-space and real-
space clustering for voids. This will give us a comprehensive pic-
ture of how the redshift-space void-mass correlation function is af-
fected by different aspects of the density and velocities, which will
be essential for understanding how the AP measurement with voids
is affected by redshift-space distortions.

In Section 2, we derive the expression for the redshift-space
void-mass correlation function using linear theory. In Section 3 we
then give examples to explain the complexity of void-mass correla-
tion function. Section 4 focuses on developing a method for mea-
suring the growth around voids and testing it using N-body sim-
ulations. During the preparation of this manuscript, Hamaus et al.
(2015) released a paper on the same topic; we compare our results
at the end of Section 4. We sum up and draw conclusions in Section
5.

2 REDSHIFT-SPACE DISTORTIONS AROUND VOIDS

Although our goal is to derive the expression for the void-mass
correlation function in redshift space in this section, there is no
requirement that the system must be underdense. The derivation
and the results are therefore relevant to the overdense case, i.e.
to the halo-mass correlation function – see e.g. Croft et al. (1999);
Zu & Weinberg (2013).

2.1 Linear theory

The difference between the redshift-space void-mass correlation
function and the pairwise galaxy-galaxy correlation function is that
we are considering the relative peculiar velocities of dark matter
(or dark matter haloes) with respect to one central point, the void
centre. The bulk motion of voids will therefore not affect the void-
mass correlation function within the scales where the bulk velocity
ﬁeld can be considered to be coherent (see Section 4 for further
discussion on this point). With the plane-parallel approximation,
|v/rcaH| ≪ 1 where v is the peculiar velocity of dark matter, rc
is its comoving distance from the observer, a is the scale factor of
the universe and H is the Hubble constant at a, the mapping be-
tween redshift-space and real-space overdensities is

1 + δs(r) = [1 + δ(r)] [1 + u′(r)]−1,

(1)
where δ(r) = ρ(r)/¯ρ − 1 with ¯ρ being the mean density of the
universe and ρ(r) the matter density at r, which is deﬁned with an
origin at the void centre. For δ(r) ≪ 1 and |∂v(r)/∂r| ≪ aH, to
linear order we have

δs(r) = δ(r) − u′(r).

(2)

The distortion term u′(r) is the gradient of the radial velocity pro-
ﬁle around the void centre v(r) projected along the line of sight:

u′(r) = ˆz ·

Eq. (2) then takes the form

f ¯δ(r) + f µ2[δ(r) − ¯δ(r)],

(7)

(8)

where instead of δs(r), we have used the notation ξs
vm(r). This is
because the conditional density ﬂuctuation is identical in meaning
to the cross-correlation function, which gives the fractional ﬂuc-
tuation in the number of cross-pairs. The above equation therefore
shows that the void-mass correlation function in redshift space con-
tains only monopole and quadrupole terms. This is different from
the pairwise galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function, where there is
also a hexadecapole moment. We discuss the reason for this dis-
tinction in greater depth in Section 4.

2.2 Quasi-linear model
The above expression is only valid on the assumption that δ ≪ 1
and that any random dispersion in velocity is small. These as-
sumptions can be relaxed, which leads to the quasi-linear model
(Peebles 1993; Fisher et al. 1994a,b; Fisher 1995). In this model,

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

the redshift-space correlation function is expressed as the convolu-
tion of its real-space version with the probability distribution func-
tion for velocities along the LOS:

where µ = (rπ − vπ/aH)/r, r2 = r2
σ + (rπ − vπ/aH)2. When
δ ≪ 1 and σv(r) is small, linear theory is well recovered (Peebles
1993; Fisher 1995), as we have also explicitly checked.
With the assumption that galaxies or haloes are linearly biased
tracers of dark matter, we can generalise this result to give the void-
galaxy or void-halo correlation function by replacing f with β in
the above equation, where β = f /b, and b is the linear bias for
galaxies or haloes.

2.3 Simulation set up and void deﬁnition

We employ N-body simulations of a ΛCDM model to test the per-
formance of the linear model and later to test our estimator to ex-
tract the linear growth from voids. The simulations are run with
the following parameters: Ωm = 0.24, ΩΛ = 0.76, h = 0.73,
and ns = 0.958 and σ8 = 0.80 (Li et al. 2013). The volume of
the simulation box is (1 h−1Gpc)3 We use all haloes above a min-
imum halo mass of Mmin = 1012.8 h−1M⊙ to ensure that each
halo contains at least 100 particles. We choose to test our analysis at
z = 0, where our halo number density is 3.1×10−4( h−1Mpc)−3,
and the linear halo bias of our halo population is b = 1.7. Voids are
found in the halo ﬁeld with the spherical underdensity algorithm
described in Cai et al. (2015), which is based on the algorithm of
Padilla et al. (2005). The algorithm works on the halo catalogue in
the simulation box by growing maximal spheres from a set of grid
points within which the number density of haloes satisﬁes the cri-
terion ∆ 6 0.2. Void candidates are ranked in decreasing order of
radius. Spheres that overlap with a neighbour by a radius more than
50% of the sum of their radii are rejected. Note that this does not
mean that no sub-voids are allowed. A small void contained in a
large one can still pass this selection criterion, and we expect the
fraction of such sub-voids to increase for smaller voids.

We choose one of the major axes of the simulation box as the
line-of-sight direction and perturb halo positions with their peculiar
velocities assuming the plane-parallel approximation:

s = r + vz/aH,

(10)

where s and r is the redshift-space and real-space comoving coor-
dinates of haloes. vz is the line-of-sight peculiar velocity. We view
our voids along the three major axes of the simulation box, which
effectively increases our sample by a factor of 3. All ﬁgures in our
paper are made in this way unless speciﬁed.

With the halo ﬁeld in redshift space, we measure the redshift-
space void-halo correlation function ξs(σ, π). We rescale the cor-
relation function for each void by the void radius along both the
σ and π directions. Examples of the stacked correlation function
are shown in the top-left panel of Fig. 1, 2, 3 & 4. For all cases,
there are very good agreements between the black contours from
simulations with the white contours from the linear model. A more
quantitative comparison of model and numerical data will be con-
ducted in Section 4.

3 DISTORTION PATTERNS: ELONGATION VS.

FLATTENING

Before we move on to write down estimators for the growth based
on the above models, we ﬁrst use these models and simulations
to understand the distortion pattern of voids in redshift space, i.e.
whether a spherical void should appear elongated or ﬂattened along
the LOS. This is particularly relevant for the AP test, which relies
on measuring the apparent size of voids along the LOS and trans-
verse to it.

In the linear model, the redshift-space void conﬁguration de-
pends on the real-space void proﬁle, the radial velocity proﬁle as
well as its gradients [Eq. (2) & (4)]. From the linear model [Eq. (8)],
the distortion pattern of voids depends solely on the real-space void
proﬁles, as the real velocity and its gradients are both determined
by the void proﬁle. It can be understood by examining the correla-
tion function in the two extreme directions: LOS versus transverse
to the LOS. When µ2 ≪ 1, the correlation function can be approx-
imated by its transverse version, i.e.

ξs
vm(r) = δ(r) +

f ¯δ(r);

1
3

(11)

When µ2 ≈ 1, the correlation function can be approximated by its
LOS version, i.e.

ξs
vm(r) = (1 + f )δ(r) −

f ¯δ(r).

2
3

(12)

Since ¯δ(r) is always negative within the void radius by deﬁnition,
the second term in Eq. (11) is of the same sign as the ﬁrst term, and
it acts to deepen the density contrast in the transverse direction.
The second term in Eq. (12), including the negative sign has the
opposite sign with respect to the ﬁrst term, which itself is boosted
by a factor of (1 + f ). Hence, the amplitude of clustering along
the LOS can be enhanced or reduced, depending on the competing
3 f ¯δ. For haloes, f δ becomes βδ, and for
amplitudes of f δ versus 2
massive haloes with a linear bias of ≈ 2, β is relatively small.
The amplitude of the ﬁrst term in the brackets is usually smaller
than the second one at r < rv. Hence it cancels part of the ﬁrst
term, making the density contrast shallower along the LOS. Both
these two effects act to ﬂatten the void. Therefore, voids usually
appear ﬂattened in redshift space within the void radius. This is
visualised in the top-right panels of Figs 1, 2 & 3. At r < rv, all
the three stacked voids appear ﬂattened, though the amplitudes of
the distortion patterns are relatively weak and difﬁcult to see on the
top-left panels where the full correlation functions from simulation
and the best-ﬁt models are shown.

At radii greater than rv, the distortion pattern depends on
the type of voids. Uncompensated voids are typically embed-
ded in larger-scale underdense environments, which also expand
in an unbound manner. These are the so-called voids-in-voids
(Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004). Here, ¯δ(r) is negative up to large
radii. If the differential proﬁle δ(r) also stays negative at large radii,
the same ﬂattening feature is expected. But if δ(r) turns positive at
some large radius, the distortion pattern becomes elongated. For
uncompensated voids, this happens typically at large radii. So the
general picture for uncompensated voids in redshift space is ﬂat-
tening at relatively small radii (greater than rv) and elongation at
the very large radii when δ(r) becomes positive. Fig. 3 gives an
example of this kind. On the bottom-left panel, the cumulative void
proﬁle ¯δ(r) is negative up to 4rv. The differential void proﬁle in-
dicated by the red dots and red dashed curves remains negative at
r < 2rv and it become weakly positive at r > 2rv. In the top

panel, the ﬂattening feature is seen up to twice the void radius; it
then becomes elongated at larger radii as expected.

In contrast, over-compensated voids are likely to be em-
bedded in overdense environments:
these are voids-in-clouds
(Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004). Here, ¯δ(r) is negative within the
compensation radius rcom, becoming positive for r > rcom. The
differential proﬁle δ(r) must then become positive at r < rcom.
Therefore, at r < rv, the void appears ﬂattened; between rv <
r < rcom it is elongated. At r > rcom, the shape becomes ﬂat-
tened again as both δ(r) and ¯δ(r) remain positive. An example is

given in Fig. 1, where we have selected voids from our simulation
with ¯δ(r) > 0 at r = rv to make sure they are voids surrounded by
large-scale overdense environments. The over-compensation prop-
erty of the stacked voids is also reﬂected by the fact that the mean
radial velocity becomes negative at r > 1.7rv, as shown in the
bottom-right panel of Fig. 1.

When adding a dispersion in velocity according to the quasi-
linear model shown in Section 2.2, we ﬁnd that the correlation func-
tions are weakly elongated along the LOS, and the effect is stronger
at r < rv. In some cases where the dispersion is dominant over the

mean streaming velocity, the interior of voids becomes elongated
rather than ﬂattened. At larger radii, the impact of velocity disper-
sion is found to be negligible.

In summary, peculiar velocities cause complex distortion pat-
terns for voids in redshift space, which can largely be understood
using linear theory. Voids usually appear ﬂattened within the radius
of underdensity according to linear theory, but can be elongated
when velocity dispersion is non-negligible; they may be elongated
or ﬂattened at large radii. This behaviour is mostly determined by
the density proﬁle, as the impact of velocity dispersion is very small

at larger radii. In some cases, the transition between ﬂattening and
elongation is very abrupt. This is different from the relatively sim-
ple distortion patterns for overdensities, where infall streaming mo-
tion causes ﬂattening on large scales and random velocity disper-
sion induces Finger-of-God-like elongation on small scales. This
suggests that the effect of redshift-space distortion on the AP mea-
surement using voids depends strongly on both the void population
and the radius where the size of the void is taken. It is perhaps
over-simplistic to apply a single stretching factor to correct for this

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

effect, as was done in Sutter et al. (2014), given the wide range of
void proﬁles encountered in practice.

The fact that the impact of velocity dispersion is small at large
radii suggest that the linear model without velocity dispersion may
be sufﬁcient to provide good ﬁt for the correlation function at r >
rv. As we will show in the next section, allowance for velocity
dispersion is needed only when ﬁtting at r < rv,

4 MEASURING THE GROWTH RATE

4.1 The growth estimator

The above expression matches to Eq. (8) because the void-mass
correlation function ξ(r) is essentially the real-space density proﬁle
of voids δ(r); thus ¯ξ(r) = ¯δ(r).

With the above pair of moments of the correlation function,

we can estimate the growth rate using the estimator

We can also express these results in Fourier space, again
assuming the plane-parallel approximation. Following Hamilton
(1998), the redshift-space overdensity is mapped into the real-space
overdensity via the redshift-space operator S, δs(r) = Sδ(r),
c )▽−2 and in Fourier
where in the linear regime, S = 1+f (∂2/∂r2
space S = 1 + f µ2
k and
µk = ˆz · ˆk. Since the bulk motion of the void will not show up
in the void-galaxy correlation, and we only require the peculiar
motion of galaxies with respect to the void centre, we only need
to apply one redshift distortion operator to the real-space density
contrast to obtain the void-mass cross-power spectrum in redshift
space:

c )▽−2 = k2

k with (∂2/∂r2

This Fourier expression may seem inconsistent with previous work
on cross-correlations in redshift space, e.g. Mo et al. (1993). Nor-
mally, one would argue that the linear Fourier-space density ﬂuctu-
ation for a single population is ˜δ = b˜δm(1+βµ2), so that the cross-
power for two differently biased tracers is P12 = b1b2Pm(1 +

β1µ2)(1 + β2µ2). Thus apparently a hexadecapole is expected un-
less one of the bias values diverges; this is certainly not the case
for voids from our simulations, where the large-scale linear bias is
approximately −2, as we have found from measuring the real space
void bias from bv = ξvm/ξmm.
This apparent discrepancy is resolved as follows. First, note
that the usual linear expression assumes a local bias, with the den-
sity of the tracer proportional to matter density; this will not ap-
ply on scales of the size of the objects concerned, which is exactly
where we are working. This point can be made in more detail using
the language of the halo model, where we would write the void-
galaxy cross-correlation in real space as

ξvg(r) = ∆v(r) + bvbgξmm(r),

(20)

where the 1-void term ∆v(r) is the mean density contrast around
the voids. When casting this into redshift space, the 2-void term
bvbgξmm(r) indeed generates a hexadecapole as above. As for the
1-void term, normally in the halo model one would consider this
to be predominantly distorted by virialized random velocities. But
for voids, the dominant internal velocities are coherent outﬂow, and
these generate a quadrupole in the cross-correlation function. This
is true even though we have adopted linear theory to calculate the
outﬂow velocity, whereas ‘linear’ would seem to imply the 2-void
term.

In the usual application of this equation to haloes, the 1-halo
term dominates at small separations because the central overden-
sity of haloes is high, whereas ξmm is of order unity there because
it is the linear correlation function. This argument is less applica-
ble here, since ∆v cannot be below −1; but nevertheless the 2-void
term is unimportant near r = rv. The reason for this is exclusion,
which is a condition that applies also to haloes: for objects of a
ﬁnite size, we cannot expect to ﬁnd correlated pairs where the cen-
tres lie very close together. Thus the above halo-model expression
is inaccurate, and the hexadecapole-generating 2-void term will not
contribute on the scales around rv where we concentrate our anal-
ysis. This can be seen in the good agreement between our linear
model with simulations (shown in Figs 1, 2 & 3), verifying empir-
ically that the signal is dominated by the pure-quadrupole 1-void
term 1.

We can now proceed to decompose the redshift-space power
spectrum into Legendre polynomials, where the only two non-zero
moments are ℓ = 0 and 2:

0 (k) = (cid:18)1 +
P s

f

3(cid:19) Pvm(k)

P s

2 (k) =

2f

Pvm(k).

The Fourier-space estimator is therefore:

˜G(f ) =

1 We have also found that the ‘linear’ void bias bv increases with decreas-
ing void radius, consistent with what was found in Chan et al. (2014) and
Hamaus et al. (2014). In principle, at a certain void radius where the void
population has bv ≈ 0, the amplitude β2 from the void-void contribution
will be large, so the hexadecapole is also expected to be large. However, the
(quasi-) linear model may also break down for small void radii, where the
underlying density ﬁeld as well as the galaxy or halo biases are expected to
be non-linear. We leave this as an open question to be investigated in future
work.

lowing, we will use N-body simulations to test the linear estimator
in conﬁguration space.

4.2 Testing the estimator with simulations

We use a sample of voids deﬁned using the halo number-density
ﬁeld to test the performance of the estimator in conﬁguration space.
We have N = 4560 voids with rv > 25 h−1Mpc. The stacked

void-halo correlation function for voids greater than 25 h−1Mpc
is shown in the top-left panel of Fig. 4. The stacked void is un-
derdense within rv. At the edge of the void radius, the overdensity
of haloes rises steeply towards positive values, but it does not be-
come positive until r ≈ 4rv. The stacked void is slightly ﬂattened
within rv and it remains ﬂattened until r ≈ 4rv where δ(r) be-
comes positive. This is expected from the linear-theory analysis in
the previous section, which attributed the distortion pattern to the
competing amplitudes of the local density, radial velocity as well
as its gradient.

We decompose each correlation function into monopole and
quadrupole components. In each radial bin, we extract the correla-
tion function as a function of µ2. The correlation function becomes
noisy in the vicinity of the µ = 1 LOS direction as the volume
per pixel becomes smaller. We remove the part of the correlation
function within 0.5rv around the middle along the LOS in order
to reduce the noise, and ﬁt ξ(r, µ) at each r with Eq. (15). We
then integrate the best-ﬁt monopole ξs
0 using Eq. (6) to obtain the
monopole term as shown in the denominator of Eq. (16).

The monopole-quadrupole decomposition is conducted for all

the individual voids. In principle, we can obtain 4560 × 3 esti-
mates of the growth factor ˜G by taking ratios between quadrupoles
and monopoles. In practice, taking ratios of noisy data is not opti-
mal. To avoid this, we effectively treat the measured monopole as
our model, and rescale it by varying a constant ˜G′ until it is best
matched by the measured quadrupole, i.e.
0(r) − ¯ξs

ξs
2(r) = [ξs

0(r)] ˜G′.

(24)

This can be treated as a minimum-χ2 ﬁtting procedure. Note that
in doing this we made no further assumption beyond linearity, i.e.
the quadrupole-monopole ratio must be a constant if linear theory
applies. This simple assumption allows us to ﬁt for the growth using
the quadrupole and monopole without actually taking their ratio;
and, more importantly, without having any prior knowledge of the
shape of the void-halo correlation function. Of course, we need to
account for the variances and covariances of the monopole and the
quadrupole. It is straightforward to show that the full covariance is

The top-right panel of Fig. 4 shows an example of the full
covariance matrix. The correlation between neighbouring bins can
be at the 50% level at r > rv, dropping to the 10% to 20% level
when radial bins are more than 0.2rv apart. This suggests that the
overlap of volume among different voids is not so strong in our
sample.

The bottom-left panel of Fig. 4 shows the corresponding
quadrupole and monopole from averaging over voids viewed along
all the three major axes of the simulation box. While the ampli-
tude of the quadrupole remains very small at all scales, the ratio
between the quadrupole and monopole is very nearly independent
of radius for r > rv. The measurement inevitably becomes nois-
ier at smaller radii, as there are fewer haloes there, but in general
the ratio drops in this regime and in some cases becomes negative.
This is expected as the impact of velocity dispersion is dominant
over the linear streaming motion, causing the correlation function
to be less ﬂattened or even to become elongated. The linear model
clearly fails at r < rv; in the following, we perform ﬁtting to the
measurement using two different models at r > rv and r > 0.5rv
respectively.

For r > rv, we adopt the linear model. We obtain a best-ﬁt
value for the growth factor G, as indicated by the red, blue and
orange dots with error bars for a volume of 1(Gpc/h)3 and the
black version is for an effective volume of 3(Gpc/h)3. It can be

seen that this is unbiased. The precision of the measurement of the
growth factor G is about 9% for our effective simulation volume of
3(h−1Gpc)3. This translates into a 9% uncertainty in β.

Since large voids have larger volume and contain more haloes
than small ones, they are expected to have higher signal-to-noise
per void. We try weighting voids according to their volume in our
analysis, ﬁnding that the error budget is reduced by ≈ 10% and
the peak of the likelihood is shifted to the left by approximately
8%, which brings in better agreement (within 1σ) with the ﬁducial
value. The precision of the measurement of the growth factor G is
about 8% for the volume of 3(Gpc/h)3, as shown by the likelihood
function computed from exp(−χ2/2) on the bottom-left panel of
Fig. 4. This also translates into a 9% constraint for β as the central
value is slightly lower than the case without weighting.

We ﬁnd that

including voids with radii smaller

than
25 h−1Mpc does not help to reduce the error signiﬁcantly, given
that the number of voids is signiﬁcantly increased, but inclusion
of these voids introduces a bias in the best-ﬁt value of β. This is
possibly because small voids are more likely to be sub-voids: these
essentially sample part of the volume that has already been used,
thus adding no more information other than introducing covari-
ance. In particular, we ﬁnd that these small voids are more likely
to be void-in-cloud objects, i.e. voids that live in overdense envi-
ronments. Such systems tend to have over-compensated proﬁles,
which are more complicated to model, with non-linear effects as-
sociated with the over-compensated wall. Indeed, we have found
that there is a scale-dependent ratio between the real-space void-
halo cross-correlation ξvh and the void-mass cross-correlation ξvm
when smaller voids are included. It may also be that, for such small
voids, neglect of their correlated velocity ﬁeld is not justiﬁed in
the way that applies for the larger voids (see the discussion in Sec-
tion 4.1).

For r > 0.5rv, we ﬁt our measurement with the quasi-linear
model shown in Eq. (9). Void proﬁles are taken from the mea-
sured monopoles and the radial velocity proﬁles are inferred from
linear theory using the monopoles. Motivated by the simulation
results shown in Figs 1-3, we adopt an error function form for
the velocity dispersion proﬁle and allow its amplitude to vary, i.e.
σv(r) = σ0 erf(r/rv), where σ0 is a free parameter. We compute
χ2s in the [G, σ0] 2D parameter space, and the resulting joint con-
straints on σ0 and G are shown on the top-left panel of Fig. 5. The
ﬁducial values are found to be consistent with the measurement
within 1σ. There is, as expected, a degree of correlation between G
and σ0, so that the conditional error on G at ﬁxed σ0 is smaller than
the true error on G, marginalized over σ0; this yields the constraint
on G shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 5. However, because we
are now able to include data at smaller r, the error budget is a fac-
tor of two smaller than when using the linear model with r > rv.
Therefore, our precision on β in this case is ≈ 5%. The green
curve at the bottom panel of the ﬁgure shows our best-ﬁt model,
which matches the data very well throughout the range of scales
shown. The impact of velocity dispersion is indeed only important
at r < rv. So σ0 is constrained mainly by small scales, while β
is sensitive to the clustering throughout the whole range of scales;
this explains why σ0 and β are not completely degenerate. With
this model, we have again found that including smaller voids does
not help to tighten the constraint for the growth. However, includ-
ing these voids can have the effect of biasing the recovered growth
rate above the ﬁducial value, by as much as 20%. We therefore rec-
ommend that practical analyses should be restricted to voids with
rv > 25 h−1Mpc.

Note that our measurement requires no prior knowledge of the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

void proﬁle, and works with quantities that we can directly mea-
sure from the data. The success of the measurement is guaranteed
by the good agreement between the recovered monopole from the
redshift space correlation function with the true answer, as shown
by the overlap between the red dots and the red dashed curves in
the bottom-left panels of Figs 1, 2 and 3. The measurement of these
moments for individual voids is very noisy as each void has its in-
trinsic conﬁguration, but by averaging measurements over all voids
in our sample, we are able to beat down the noise and recover the
monopole and quadrupoles without any obvious bias (e.g. bottom-
left panel of Fig. 4). We have also tested that the best-ﬁt results
remains unchanged when we bin our voids in groups of 10 or 20,
conduct the measurement for each void composite and take the av-
erage.

The simplicity of the linear modelling of void-galaxy cross-
correlations contrasts with the modelling of the redshift-space
galaxy autocorrelation function, which becomes difﬁcult even
at relatively large scales. For example, recent measurements
of the growth rate using the galaxy autocorrelation function
(Samushia et al. 2014; Howlett et al. 2015) restricted their analy-
ses to scales greater than 24 h−1Mpc and 25 h−1Mpc respectively.
This is the same as the minimal void radius in our analysis, but the
autocorrelation analysis requires careful modelling of velocity dis-
persion even to reach these scales, whereas we have seen that it
is unimportant for voids. Adding the dispersion term in the quasi-
linear model allows us to use information down to the much smaller
scales of r = 0.5rv, or 12 h−1Mpc for the void sample where the
results are robust.

4.3 Comparison to Hamaus et al.

During the preparation of this manuscript, two papers on the same
topic were released (Hamaus et al. 2015; Hamaus et al. 2016) [see
also Mao et al. (2016) and Shoji & Lee (2012) where the impact of
redshift-space distortion on void ellipticity is studied in the latter].
Our work is distinct in terms of void deﬁnition, methodology of
measuring the growth as well as the prior assumptions in the model
ﬁtting. Hamaus et al. (2015) and Hamaus et al. (2016) use VIDE
(Sutter et al. 2015), which is based on the watershed algorithm of
ZOBOV (Neyrinck 2008) for HOD galaxies. We employ the spher-
ical underdensity void-ﬁnding algorithm for haloes (Padilla et al.
2005; Cai et al. 2015). Hamaus et al. (2015) and Hamaus et al.
(2016) assumed a 4-parameter model for the void proﬁle (which
largely depends on the void ﬁnding algorithm) and marginalised
over this model. In our methodology, no prior assumption about the
void proﬁles is needed, as we have shown that we can measure the
void proﬁle from the monopole of the data. Our analysis pipeline is
in principle applicable to voids deﬁned from any void-ﬁnding algo-
rithm. Hamaus et al. (2015) assumed a Lorentzian distribution for
the velocity dispersion, and ﬁxed the width of the Lorentzian func-
tion (using the best ﬁt value from their simulations) prior to their
MCMC ﬁtting. In our linear analysis, no model assumption for the
velocity is needed; and in our quasi-linear analysis, we only assume
a functional form for the dispersion proﬁle without ﬁxing anything
further. Hamaus et al. (2015) and Hamaus et al. (2016) have to bin
their voids before ﬁtting, which may come from the restriction that
they have to assume a model for the void proﬁle, and the model
may not be able to describe individual proﬁle. Our analysis is ﬂex-
ible as we have shown that binning our voids in sets of 10, 20 or
not binning at all yields the same results. Hamaus et al. (2015) in-
cluded the distance distortion parameter related to the AP test for
their ﬁtting. We restrict our analysis to a single free parameter of

the growth for the purpose of understanding how the conﬁguration
of voids are affected by peculiar velocity.

Perhaps more importantly,

the results from Hamaus et al.
(2015) for the growth appear to be dominated by systematics and
are strongly biased from their ﬁducial values, whereas our measure-
ment for the growth displays no signiﬁcant bias within our chosen
range of void sizes. We suspect that a possible reason for the bias
in the results of Hamaus et al. (2015) is that they have used all data
including the very interior of voids and in some cases they have
used voids with radii smaller than 10 h−1Mpc. We have excluded
this region (r < 0.5rv) from our ﬁtting and restrict our analysis to
using voids with rv > 25 h−1Mpc.

Finally, our results are also noticeably different from those of
Hamaus et al. (2016) for the best constraint on the growth parame-
ter. Using voids from a volume of 3.5(h−1Gpc)3 from the SDSS
DR11 CMASS galaxy sample, they report constraints on β at the
20% level 2. With a similar volume of 3(h−1Gpc)3 from simula-
tions, our best constraint on β is a few times tighter, i.e. at the 5%
level.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have derived models for the void-halo or void-galaxy corre-
lation function in redshift space as well as their Fourier space ver-
sions. We show that the linear-theory void-halo correlation function
contains only monopole and quadrupole terms, which allows us to
write down an estimator for the ﬂuctuation growth rate based on the
ratio of quadrupole and monopole. We then test the estimator for
voids found using halo density ﬁelds from numerical simulations.
We are able to extract the monopole from the correlation function
in an unbiased fashion at all scales of interest, including the interior
of voids. No prior knowledge of the void proﬁle is needed, as it can
be measured from the data. This approach is to be contrasted with
the work of Ceccarelli et al. (2013) and Paz et al. (2013), who used
SDSS voids to estimate the mean radial velocity proﬁle for voids,
whereas we are able to obtain this from linear theory.

The ratio between monopole and quadrupole provides an un-
biased estimates for the growth parameter β = f /b at r > rv. For
an effective volume of 3(h−1Gpc)3, β is constrained in this way
with 9% precision. Extending the model to allow for a dispersion
of random velocities allows us to apply the quasi-linear model at
smaller scales r > 0.5rv and tighten the constraint for β by a factor
of two. In principle, our estimator is applicable to any void ﬁnding
algorithm, since we have made no assumption beyond linear the-
ory and have no speciﬁc requirement for the void population. We
have noted that this lack of bias contrasts with the results of the re-
cent paper by Hamaus et al. (2015), and we have highlighted some
methodological differences between our studies that may account
for this rather different outcome.

Our models allow us to understand the complex distortion pat-
tern of voids generated by peculiar velocities. We ﬁnd that voids
may appear elongated or ﬂattened along the line of sight at dif-
ferent radii: this can be explained by the competing amplitudes of
the local density, radial velocity proﬁles and their gradients, with
the latter two being determined by the cumulative density proﬁle of
voids in linear theory. Velocity dispersion causes a slight elongation

even with Ωm ﬁxed at the ﬁducial value, the constraint on β would remain
similar.

along the LOS for the correlation function, which counters the ﬂat-
tening effect caused by the streaming motion in the interior of the
void and sometimes reverses it, causing the sign of the quadrupole
to ﬂip. However, the effect of a random velocity dispersion is usu-
ally negligible outside the void radius. Thus the dispersion patten
for voids is complex, and the key element that governs the void dis-
tortion pattern at r > rv is mostly the void proﬁle. In light of this,
the distortion pattern for voids-in-clouds and voids-in-voids are ex-
pected to be different. The picture will change when there is strong
non-linearity, but we have demonstrated that for large voids with
radii greater than 25 h−1Mpc, the quasi-linear model works very
well.

The distortion patterns of voids in redshift space is more com-
plex and is distinct from redshift-space distortions in overdensities.
For overdensities, infall motions cause ﬂattening on large scales
and random velocity dispersions induce elongation along the line
of sight on small scales.

Our study implies that Alcock-Paczynski (AP) measurements
using voids will be affected by peculiar velocity distortions in a
complex manner. Assuming the correct cosmology, the dimension
of voids along the LOS may appear greater or smaller than that in
the transverse direction. It depends on the void population, and for
the same void population there is also a radial dependence. Ulti-
mately, knowing the void proﬁle is the key to understanding the
impact of peculiar velocities on the apparent axial ratios of voids
and on the resulting AP measurement. Fortunately, we have shown
that the redshift-space void proﬁle can be successfully extracted
from the void-halo correlation function. This may provide the key
information to correct for the AP measurement using voids.

A striking conclusion of this study is that the void-galaxy cor-
relation function may be able to provide a high precision on the
growth rate (5% for β for a volume of 3(h−1Gpc)3, comparable
to that obtained from using the LRG autocorrelation function – e.g.
Samushia et al. (2014) found a precision of 10% from a volume
of 2(h−1Gpc)3. This success depends on the applicability of the
quasi-linear model at small scales r ≈ 12 h−1Mpc; this is easier
to achieve using voids, as the signal from extreme overdensities is
then removed, and these are hardest to model. The next step will
be to see if these virtues are maintained when using mock data that
accurately match real galaxy catalogues. If this is indeed the case,
then we will have not only a tool for assessing the robustness of
growth-rate measurements, but also a unique probe of deviations
from standard Einstein gravity, which are expected to reveal them-
selves most strongly in low-density environments.
