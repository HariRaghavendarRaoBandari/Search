and changes in kinetic energy of ∆Ekin = 1.3 × 10−20 J (∆Ekin/e = 83 meV) per
atom were achieved. Guided and decelerated atoms, and those conﬁned in stationary
electrostatic traps, were detected in situ by pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation. The results
of numerical calculations of particle trajectories within the decelerator have been used
to characterise the observed deceleration eﬃciencies, and aid in the interpretation of

1. Introduction

Guides, decelerators and traps for gas-phase atoms and molecules which are based on
two-dimensional arrays of surface-based metallic wires and electrodes [1, 2, 3, 4] oﬀer
several advantages over larger three-dimensional structures. These chip-based devices
(1) permit the generation of a wide range of trap geometries, (2) oﬀer opportunities
for miniaturisation using micro-fabrication techniques, (3) can be readily extended,
e.g., for the deceleration of heavier samples, (4) are suited to operation in cryogenic
environments, and (5) can be integrated with other chip-based devices including, e.g.,
microwave circuits. In this context, a range of chip-based electric guides, decelerators
and traps for atoms and molecules in highly-excited Rydberg states have recently been
developed [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These devices exploit the large electric dipole moments
associated with high Rydberg states, and the forces that can be exerted on samples
in these states using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds [9, 10, 11, 12]. With dipole moments
exceeding 1000 D for states with principal quantum numbers, n > 16, the large electric
ﬁeld gradients that can be generated above surface-based electrode structures permit
eﬃcient deceleration over short distances.

2

The chip-based Rydberg-Stark decelerators and traps that have been implemented
up to now relied upon detection of decelerated or trapped atoms or molecules by pulsed
electric ﬁeld ionisation after exiting the devices. In experiments involving the production
of velocity-controlled beams by acceleration, deceleration or guiding, samples were
detected following a period of free-ﬂight beyond the decelerators [4, 7, 8]. Further, in
experiments in which decelerated atoms were trapped on-chip in stationary electrostatic
traps, it was necessary to reaccelerate the samples oﬀ the chip before detection [4, 5].
This reduced the detection eﬃciency and complicated the interpretation of the rates of
decay of the trapped samples.

In experiments with Rydberg atoms and molecules conﬁned in electrostatic traps
composed of three-dimensional electrode structures, eﬃcient in situ detection of the
trapped samples was achieved by pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation upon rapidly switching
the potentials applied to the trap electrodes [13, 14, 15, 16]. Although detection of
polar CO molecules, in the metastable a 3Π1 state, by resonance-enhanced multiphoton
ionisation directly above a chip-based Stark decelerator has been implemented [17], in
situ detection has so far not been possible in chip-based Rydberg-Stark decelerators.
Here we demonstrate that eﬃcient in situ detection of samples of decelerated and
electrostatically trapped helium Rydberg atoms can be achieved in a chip-based
transmission-line decelerator [8] following the application of pulsed electrical potentials
to the ground-planes of the device. In the deceleration process atoms initially travelling
at 2000 m/s were brought to rest in the laboratory-ﬁxed frame-of-reference upon the
application of accelerations of up to −1.3× 107 m/s2. The mean kinetic energy removed
per atom was therefore ∆Ekin = 1.3 × 10−20 J (∆Ekin/e = 83 meV).

In the following, the apparatus used in the experiments is ﬁrst described in
Section 2. The experimental results are presented in Section 3 and compared to the
results of numerical calculations of particle trajectories within the transmission-line
decelerator. Finally, the main aspects of the paper are summarised in Section 4 and
comparisons are made with previous work in the literature.

2. Experiment

The experiments described here were performed using metastable helium atoms initially
travelling in pulsed supersonic beams. These atoms, in the 1s2s 3S1 level, were prepared
in a dc electric discharge at the exit of a pulsed valve [18]. After passing through a 2 mm
diameter copper skimmer, and a region in which any stray ions or electrons travelling
with the neutral atoms were deﬂected away from the propagation axis of the beam (see,
e.g. [19]), the atoms entered the main part of the apparatus depicted schematically in
Figure 1.

Between the two metallic plates labelled E1 and E2 in Figure 1 the metastable
atoms were photoexcited to n = 48 Rydberg-Stark states using the resonance-enhanced
1s2s 3S1 →1s3p 3P2 →1sns/1snd two-photon excitation scheme. This excitation process
was driven using focussed cw laser radiation with wavenumbers of 25708.5876 cm−1

(≡ 388.9751 nm) and 12698.4967 cm−1 (≡ 787.4948 nm) for each transition, respectively.
Photoexcitation was performed in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld that was switched to
0.2 V/cm for 3 µs at the time of excitation. This was achieved by applying a pulsed
potential of -0.25 V with rise and fall times of 300 ns, to electrode E2 while electrode E1
was maintained at 0 V. In this way 6-mm-long bunches of Rydberg atoms were prepared
in the low-ﬁeld-seeking |n, k(cid:105) = |48, 25(cid:105) Rydberg-Stark state (k is the diﬀerence between
the parabolic quantum numbers n1 and n2 [20]). This state has a positive Stark energy
shift and an electric dipole moment of 4600 D . States with n = 48 were chosen for
the experiments because (1) the transition moments to the outer Stark states with
the largest electric dipole moments were appropriate for eﬃcient photoexcitation and
deceleration, and (2) they had a suﬃciently high threshold for electric ﬁeld ionisation
that ionisation-induced losses during the deceleration process, particularly at the highest

applied accelerations, were minimal.

After photoexcitation the Rydberg atoms travelled toward the transmission-line
decelerator [see Figure 1(a)]. The general design of this decelerator was the same as
that used in previous experiments [8]. The center conductor of the device was composed
of a set of equally spaced, square, copper segments, with dimensions of 1 mm × 1 mm,
and a center-to-center spacing of dcc = 2 mm. The insulating gap between the center-
conductor segments and the decelerator ground planes was 1 mm and the upper-plate
electrode was positioned parallel to, and 4.5 mm above, the resulting two-dimensional
transmission line in the y-dimension. To reduce eﬀects of collisions of decelerated and
trapped Rydberg atoms with the trailing components of the atomic beam the decelerator
was curved in the xz-plane with a radius of curvature of 0.81 m. The two-dimensional
array of decelerator and ground-plane electrodes were prepared by chemical etching of
copper on a FR4 laminate substrate.

To facilitate in situ detection of the Rydberg atoms two 2.5-mm-diameter apertures
were included in the upper-plate electrode of the decelerator. The ﬁrst of these apertures
[A1 in Figure 1(a)] was located on the axis of propagation of the unperturbed atomic
beam, while the second [A2 in Figure 1(a)] was located 10 mm oﬀ axis in the negative x
dimension, directly above the 74th segment of the decelerator center conductor. Rydberg
atoms located within the decelerator structure at the positions of these two apertures
were detected by electric ﬁeld ionisation upon the simultaneous application of pulsed
potentials of +350 V to the two ground planes of the transmission line. Immediately
prior to the application of these ionisation pulses, the potentials on the upper-plate
electrode and all electrodes of the decelerator center-conductor were switched to 0 V. The
resulting He+ ions were accelerated through the appropriate aperture in the upper-plate
electrode and toward a microchannel plate (MCP) detector as depicted in Figure 1(b).
The MCP detector used had a front plate diameter of 25 mm which, with a potential of
-2 kV applied, ensured that helium Rydberg atoms ionised beneath either aperture A1
or aperture A2 were eﬃciently collected for detection. When the decelerator was oﬀ,
the excited Rydberg atoms propagated unperturbed through it and could be detected
upon passing beneath aperture A1. If the decelerator was on, the strong inhomogeneous
electric ﬁelds within it caused atoms which were not conﬁned within one of the moving
traps to be ionised or suﬃciently deﬂected that they were unable to reach aperture A1.
However, if transported through the decelerator while conﬁned in one of the moving
traps, the Rydberg atoms could be detected upon passing beneath aperture A2.

The transmission-line decelerator was operated in the same manner as that
described previously [8]. Arrays of continuously moving electric traps were generated
within the device by applying a set of ﬁve time-dependent, oscillating electrical
potentials, Vi(t), to consecutive segments, i, of the center conductor such that

Vi(t) = V0 cos[ωt − (i − 1)φ],

(1)

where ω is the angular oscillation frequency of the potentials, and φ = 2π/5 is the phase
shift from one center-conductor segment to the next. For all experiments described

here the amplitude of the oscillating potentials was selected to be V0 = 150 V, and the
time-independent potential on the upper-plate electrode, Vu, was set to Vu = −V0/2.

doing so accelerate or decelerate the bunches of atoms conﬁned within them, a time-

3. Results

The operation of this transmission-line decelerator with in situ detection was
investigated by measuring the times of ﬂight of the helium Rydberg atoms from their
position of photoexcitation to the detection apertures A1 or A2 [see Figure 1(a)]. For the
bunches of Rydberg atoms with mean initial longitudinal speeds of 2000 m/s that were
prepared in the experiments, the intensity maxima of the corresponding time-of-ﬂight
distributions were recorded 80.5 µs after photoexcitation when the device was oﬀ.

To determine the optimal time after photoexcitation to activate the oscillating
decelerator potentials, τin, the detection time of ﬂight was set to 80.5 µs, and the signal
associated with atoms guided through the decelerator at a constant speed of 2000 m/s,
while conﬁned in a single travelling trap, was recorded while the activation time of the
decelerator was adjusted. The results of this measurement are presented in Figure 2.
From this data is can be seen that intensity maxima appear in the signal from the guided
atoms every time the decelerator potentials were activated when the bunch of Rydberg
atoms was located at the position of one of the moving traps of the device. Because
the detected atoms initially moved at 2000 m/s, and the spatial separation between the
traps of the decelerator was 5 dcc = 10 mm, the intensity maxima seen in Figure 2 are
separated by the time taken by the atoms to move from the position of one trap to the
next, i.e., 5 µs.

At early activation times, i.e., τin (cid:39) 1 µs, the oscillating decelerator potentials are
active before the Rydberg atoms exit the photoexcitation region through the aperture
in E2 [see Figure 1(a)], and are loaded into the ﬁrst trap of the decelerator as it forms at
the entrance of the device. For τin > 5.7 µs the atoms are located within the decelerator
when the device is activated. The contrast in the signal, between the intensity maxima
and minima, at early times in Figure 2 is evidence that Rydberg atoms that are not
transported through the decelerator while conﬁned in one of the travelling traps are
either ionised or deﬂected suﬃciently that they do not reach either of the detection
apertures at the selected ﬂight time. When a long time elapses between photoexcitation
and activation of the decelerator potentials, i.e., when τin (cid:38) 40 µs, the atoms are no-
longer located above the curved center-conductor of the decelerator when the traps are
generated. As a result, they are not eﬃciently loaded into the travelling traps and
guided to the detection position beneath aperture A2. In this situation some atoms do
reach aperture A1 at the appropriate time of ﬂight for detection but because they are
not guided while conﬁned in one of the travelling traps, the observed signal intensity
does not depend upon the activation time of the decelerator potentials. To maximise
the length of the decelerator used for deceleration of these fast beams of helium, in all
of the measurements described below a decelerator activation time of τin = 0.7 µs was
employed.

The eﬀect of the decelerator on the time-of-ﬂight distributions of the Rydberg atoms
was investigated by recording the integrated He+ signal measured for a range of times of
ﬂight from the excitation position to the in situ detection regions. With the decelerator

oﬀ, the time-of-ﬂight distribution associated with the unperturbed beam of Rydberg
atoms was recorded and is displayed in Figure 3(a-i) (broad black curve). With the
decelerator then activated to guide the trapped atoms at a constant speed of 2000 m/s
to the detection region beneath aperture A2, the narrower and more intense time-of-
ﬂight distribution also displayed in Figure 3(a-i) was recorded. The single intensity
maximum associated with this distribution conﬁrms that the Rydberg atoms were all
transported through the decelerator in one single travelling trap. The reduced width
and increased intensity of the signal, compared to that recorded with the decelerator
oﬀ, is a consequence of the strong conﬁnement of the atoms within the trap as they
were guided.

The trapped atoms transported through the decelerator at constant speed in
Figure 3(a-i) were then decelerated by applying the appropriate frequency chirps to the
oscillating decelerator potentials. For a constant acceleration of at = −0.5 × 107 m/s2

the atoms were decelerated from 2000 m/s to 1550 m/s and arrived at the detection
region beneath aperture A2 after a time-of-ﬂight of 90.5 µs [Figure 3(a-ii)]. The
reduction in the intensity of the signal associated with these decelerated atoms is a
consequence of the eﬀect of the acceleration on the trapping potential experienced
by the atoms, and collisions involving the trapped atoms. Larger accelerations, of
at = −0.9 × 107, − 1.1 × 107 and −1.2 × 107 m/s2 [Figure 3(a-iii) – Figure 3(a-v) as
indicated], resulted in the production of velocity-controlled beams with ﬁnal tangential
velocities of 1080, 735 and 475 m/s, respectively.

Comparison of the experimentally recorded Rydberg atom time-of-ﬂight distribu-
tions presented in Figure 3(a) with the results of numerical calculations of particle
trajectories through the decelerator [Figure 3(b)] oﬀers insight into the origins of the
loss of atoms upon deceleration to lower ﬁnal velocities. These calculations were per-
formed by solving the classical equations of motion of the Rydberg atoms in the moving
frame of reference associated with one single trap of the decelerator. The eﬀects of
acceleration in this reference frame were included through pseudo potentials which were
dependent upon the displacement from the electric ﬁeld minimum of the trap [8, 21, 22].
Throughout the entire guiding and deceleration processes the instantaneous centripetal
acceleration, arising as a result of the curvature of the decelerator, and the applied
tangential acceleration, at, were accounted for [8].

Because the in situ detection regions in the decelerator have very well deﬁned
spatial dimensions, the longitudinal temperature of the excited ensemble of Rydberg
atoms could be accurately determined from the time-of-ﬂight distribution recorded with
the decelerator oﬀ. Using this data the bunch of atoms was found to have a relative
translational temperature in the z dimension of Tz = (cid:104)Ekin(cid:105)/kB = 3 K, where (cid:104)Ekin(cid:105)
is the mean relative kinetic energy of the atoms, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Taking into account the 6 mm longitudinal extent of the excited bunch of atoms, this
temperature matches that reported in other experiments with pulsed supersonic beams
of metastable helium generated with similar discharge sources [5]. The transverse
temperatures of the atoms were determined, from the geometric constraints imposed
by the skimmer and focussed narrow-bandwidth laser beams in the experiments, to be
Tx = Ty = 10 mK. By randomly generating ensembles of Rydberg atoms with these
initial parameters, trajectories in the moving traps of the decelerator were calculated
numerically until the traps reached the detection aperture A2. The corresponding arrival
times of the atoms in this detection region were then used to generate the calculated
time-of-ﬂight distributions presented in Figure 3(b).

In Figure 3(b-i) the calculated intensity of the signal associated with the Rydberg
atom beam when the decelerator was oﬀ, was normalised in the same way as that
recorded experimentally [Figure 3(a-i)]. The result of the particle trajectory calculations
performed for atoms guided at a constant speed of 2000 m/s exhibits an intense, narrow
maximum in the time of ﬂight distribution at a ﬂight time of 80.5 µs. This time-of-ﬂight
distribution is in agreement with that observed in the experimental data if it is scaled
by a factor of 0.5. This scaling accounts for the diﬀerences in the He+ ion extraction

9

eﬃciency from the in situ detection region beneath aperture A1, and that in the region
beneath aperture A2 in the experiment. It also accounts for eﬀects of collisions between
the trapped Rydberg atoms on the eﬃciency with which they are transported through
the decelerator [8]. Neither of these eﬀects are treated in the calculations.

For a tangential acceleration of at = −0.5× 107 m/s2 the intensity maximum in the
corresponding calculated time-of-ﬂight distribution [Figure 3(b-ii)] shifts to the later
time of 90.5 µs, exactly matching that observed in the experiments. The calculated
ﬂight times associated with the intensity maxima upon further deceleration, toward
ﬁnal speeds of 475 m/s, are also in excellent agreement with those in the experimental
data. However, in each case the amplitude of the intensity maxima in the time of ﬂight
distributions [scaled by a factor of 0.25 with respect to the undecelerated distribution as
indicated in Figure 3(b)] is greater in the calculated data than in the experimental data.
The diﬀerences in the signal intensity indicate a loss of atoms from the travelling traps
of the decelerator in the experiments which is not solely a result of their translational
motion. This decay of atoms from the moving traps of the decelerator arises from a
combination of spontaneous emission, eﬀects of blackbody radiation, collisions between
the Rydberg atoms within the traps, and collisions between the trapped Rydberg atoms
and the background gas in the vacuum chamber and is discussed in more detail in
Section 4.

In the case of the most slowly moving beams of Rydberg atoms, decelerated
to 475 m/s,
in Figure 3, 94% of the initial kinetic energy was removed for at =
−1.2 × 107 m/s2. Therefore with a further increase in the acceleration the trapped
atoms could be brought to a stand-still in the laboratory-ﬁxed frame of reference. As
can be seen in Figure 4(b), increasing the acceleration to at = −1.250× 107 m/s2 results
in a ﬁnal tangential velocity of 270 m/s. In this case the decelerated atoms pass beneath
aperture A2 139 µs after photoexcitation. A further adjustment of the acceleration to
at = −1.279 × 107 m/s2 brought the trap to rest directly beneath aperture A2, 156 µs
after photoexcitation [vertical arrow in Figure 4(a)]. The data in this ﬁgure have been
scaled by a factor of 6, highlighting the further loss of trapped atoms over the ﬁnal
period of deceleration.

When the trap in which the Rydberg atoms are decelerated is brought to rest
intensity in the

the absence of collisions and blackbody radiation, the decay rates via spontaneous
emission from the initially excited n = 48 Rydberg-Stark states are on the order of
1000 s−1 (i.e, τ1/e ∼ 1 ms). However, ﬁtting a single exponential function to the data in
Figure 4(a) for times beyond 156 µs results in a decay constant of only 25 µs (dashed red
curve). Because the experiments were performed in a room temperature environment,
contributions from blackbody radiation to the evolution and decay of the trapped atoms
will be signiﬁcant [16, 23]. These eﬀects, particularly those associated with blackbody
photoionisation, and collisions of the trapped Rydberg atoms with the background gas

4. Discussion and conclusions

The time constant of 25 µs associated with the decay of the Rydberg atoms from
the stationary oﬀ-axis electrostatic trap employed in the experiments described here,
although signiﬁcantly shorter than the ﬂuorescence lifetimes of the excited states, is of
a similar magnitude to the time constants reported in previous experiments in which
Rydberg atoms were conﬁned in stationary chip-based traps constructed from similar
materials. For example, in experiments with hydrogen atoms in Rydberg-Stark states
with n = 31 trapped on the atomic beam axis above a surface-electrode decelerator,
decay constants of τ1/e (cid:39) 30 µs were determined [4]. While in similar experiments
with helium atoms in singlet Rydberg states with n = 31, trap decay constants of
τ1/e = 22.7 µs were reported [5]. In both cases, these decay constants were shorter than
the respective, 142 µs and 58 µs, ﬂuorescence lifetimes of the excited states. Because
the atoms were trapped on the axes of the atomic beams in these previous experiments,
collisions with the trailing components of the beams must have played a role in the decay

from the traps [16]. In the experiments reported here, the Rydberg atoms were trapped
oﬀ the axis of propagation of the atomic beam, in a transmission-line decelerator of a
diﬀerent design to the surface-electrode decelerators. However, the materials from which
the chip-based array of decelerator electrodes were fabricated are similar (chemically
etched copper on a FR4 laminate substrate). Because these laminate substrates outgas
in vacuum, we suspect that collisions between the trapped Rydberg atoms and the
gas emanating from the substrates used in the construction of the decelerators play a
signiﬁcant role in the observed trap decay.

Further quantitative information on the rates of decay of atoms conﬁned in the
travelling traps of the decelerator during the deceleration process, can be obtained
by comparing the experimentally recorded and calculated Rydberg atom time-of-ﬂight
distributions presented in Figure 3. This was achieved by determining the ratio of
the peak intensity in each experimentally recorded time-of-ﬂight distribution in this
ﬁgure, Iexp, to that in the corresponding calculated time-of-ﬂight distribution, Icalc. The
dependence of these relative eﬃciencies on the ﬂight time of the atoms is displayed in
Figure 5 (shaded circles). In calculating these relative signal intensities, the dependence
of the deceleration eﬃciency on the applied acceleration is deconvolved, with the result
that the rate of decay of atoms from the travelling decelerator traps is obtained. As can

be seen in Figure 5, to ﬁrst order these data exhibit an exponential decay with a time
constant of 19.2 µs. This is again on the same scale as the time constant associated with
the decay of the Rydberg atoms from the stationary trap [Figure 4(a)]. These results,
together with the observations from previously reported experiments, would therefore
suggest that in future experiments with chip-based Rydberg-Stark decelerators it will
be important to study the eﬀects of the substrate materials on the rates of decay of
trapped atoms and molecules, and possibly reﬁne the construction of the devices using
alternative substrate materials based on the outcomes of this work.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated complete deceleration and in situ detection
of
fast beams of helium Rydberg atoms to zero-velocity in the laboratory-ﬁxed
frame of reference while conﬁned in the travelling electric traps of a transmission-
line decelerator. When brought to rest the samples of decelerated Rydberg atoms
were electrostatically trapped directly above the center conductor of the segmented
electrical transmission line used to generate the deceleration and trapping electric
ﬁeld distributions. These results are expected to be of importance in collision and
spectroscopic studies involving cold Rydberg atoms and molecules, including those at
vacuum–solid-state interfaces [24, 25, 26], and in hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamics
with Rydberg atoms coupled to chip-based microwave circuits [27, 28]. Since the
segmented electrical transmission line of the decelerator used here can be considered
to be composed of a series of coplanar electrical resonators, the results presented in
Figure 4(a) represent a demonstration of electrostatic trapping gas-phase Rydberg atoms
above such a circuit element.
