DOUBLE ROOTS OF RANDOM POLYNOMIALS WITH INTEGER

COEFFICIENTS

OHAD N. FELDHEIM AND ARNAB SEN

Abstract. We consider random polynomials whose coeﬃcients are independent and identically
distributed on the integers. We prove that if the coeﬃcient distribution has bounded support and
its probability to take any particular value is at most 1
2 , then the probability of the polynomial to
have a double root is dominated by the probability that either 0, 1, or −1 is a double root up to
an error of o(n−2). We also show that if the support of coeﬃcient distribution excludes 0 then the
double root probability is O(n−2). Our result generalizes a similar result of Peled, Sen and Zeitouni
[13] for Littlewood polynomials.

Let n ∈ N and let (ξj)0≤j be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random

variables taking values in Z. Deﬁne the random polynomial P = Pn by

In a previous paper, Peled, Sen and Zeitouni [13] showed that if the random variables are supported
on {−1, 0, +1} with maxx∈{−1,0,1} P(ξ0 = x) < 1√3
, then the probability of P to have a double root
in the complex plane is same as having a double root at 0,±1 up to an error of o(n−2). In this
paper, we extend the result for more general integer-valued random variables. Our main result is
the following.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose the coeﬃcient distribution satisﬁes the following conditions.

There exists constant M ≥ 1 such that P(|ξ0| ≤ M ) = 1.

Then we have

P(cid:16)P has a double root(cid:17) = P(cid:16)P has a double root at either 0,−1 or 1(cid:17) + o(n−2) as n → ∞. (4)
Moreover, if P(ξ0 = 0) = 0, then P(cid:16)P has a double root(cid:17) = O(n−2).

We make a few remarks about the above theorem.
(1) When P(ξ0 = 0) = 0, the upper bound in Theorem 1.1 is sharp. When ξi’s are i.i.d.
±1 symmetric Bernoulli and (n + 1) is divisible by 4, then it was shown in [13] that the
probability of having a double root is Θ(n−2).

P(cid:16)P has a double root(cid:17)

(2) We can have a better error bound if we allow the possibility of having double roots other
low-degree roots of unity. More precisely, our proof can be modiﬁed to show that for any
ﬁxed d ≥ 1,

= P(cid:16)P has a double root at 0 or some roots of unity of degree at most d(cid:17) + o(n−2d).

(3) The bounded support condition (2) can be weaken with minor modiﬁcations of our argu-
ments. We did not pursue that here for sake of simplicity. On the other hand, we do not
know how to relax condition (3) on the size of the maximum of atom and it seems that
the current bound 1
2 is a limitation of our proof. In fact, we believe that both conditions
are unnecessary and that the result (4) should hold for any non-degenerate integer-valued
coeﬃcient distribution.

(4) Even though some parts of our proof closely follow the lines of arguments from the paper
of Peled, Sen and Zeitouni [13], extending the result to general integer-valued coeﬃcients,
however, poses a few signiﬁcant challenges. For example, to handle high-degree double
roots, we need a key anti-concentration estimate for P (±2) given in the form of Theorem 1.2.
is one-to-one, which immediately implies the bound that

When the coeﬃcients are ±1-valued, the map (a0, . . . , an) 7→Pi=1 ai2i : {−1, 1}n+1 → Z

P(P (±2) = m) ≤(cid:0) max

x=±1

P(ξ0 = x)(cid:1)n+1.

The paper [13] made use of the above simple observation. But for more general integer-
valued coeﬃcients, we lose such one-to-one property, which makes proving Theorem 1.2
nontrivial. One consequence of this diﬃculty is that the result here requires the maximal
atom of the coeﬃcient distribution to be at most 1
could be
handled.

2 while in [13] atoms up to 1√3

Moreover, the argument used in [13] to deal with low degree roots does not carry over
either. In [13], P was always a monic polynomial and hence its roots were algebraic inte-
gers. For algebraic integers, one can use some partial result (see, e.g., Dobrowolski [5]) on
Lehmer’s conjecture to show that any non-zero algebraic integer is either a root of unity or
has a conjugate which is a bit far (depending on its degree) away from unit circle. In low
degree case, [13] made use of this dichotomy of algebraic integers. In contrast, in our case
we also have to deal with non-monic P , so its roots are algebraic numbers in general. Such
dichotomy is not available for algebraic numbers. For example, there are algebraic numbers
which are not a root of unity and all of its conjugates lie on the unit circle. This requires
new methods for handling such roots which are given in sections 5 and 6.

A key instrument in the proof of the theorem, which may be of independent interest, is the

following anti-concentration bound.
Theorem 1.2. Under condition (3) there exists ε > 0 such that for all n ∈ N large enough we have

max
m∈Z

P(cid:16)P (±2) = m(cid:17) ≤ 2−n( 1

2 +ε).

We proceed as follows. In Section 1.1 we provide some notation and reduce Theorem 1.1 to several
key lemmata. In Section 2 we prove Theorem 1.2. Each subsequent section is then dedicated to
the proof of one of the key lemmata stated in Section 1.1.

1.1. Proof Overview. Preliminaries. Recall that a real number α is called algebraic if it is a
root of a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients. Let A denote the set of algebraic numbers. The
minimal polynomial of α ∈ A is the unique least degree monic polynomial in Q[X] with a root at α.
The algebraic degree of α is the degree of the minimal polynomial of α, which we denote by deg(α).

DOUBLE ROOTS OF RANDOM POLYNOMIALS WITH INTEGER COEFFICIENTS

A real number α is said to be an algebraic integer if all the coeﬃcients of its minimal polynomial
are integers.

We deﬁne Λ(α), the house of α, by

Λ(α) =

max

j∈{1,...,deg(α)} |αj|,

Where α1 = α, . . . , αdeg(α) are the conjugates of α, i.e., the roots of the minimal polynomial of α.
We further deﬁne the associated minimal polynomial of α in Z[x] to be the unique polynomial in
Z[x] of degree deg(α) with a root at α, whose leading coeﬃcient is positive and whose coeﬃcients
are coprime.

Main lemmata. The proof of Theorem 1.1 breaks into several cases.
subsection, we let P be as in Theorem 1.1 with coeﬃcient distribution satisfying (2) and (3).

In what follows in this

We ﬁrst consider the probability of having a double root of algebraic degree and prove the

following result.

Lemma 1.3 (high degree). Given any B > 0, there exist a constant C0 > 0 such that

P(P has a double root α with deg(α) ≥ C0 log n) = O(n−B).

The proof of Lemma 1.3 follows the line of arguments given in [13], which, in turn, was based
on idea that appeared in a work of Filaseta and Konyagin [7]. However, several modiﬁcations are
needed when dealing with general integer-valued coeﬃcients. Most crucially, we need a new anti-
concentration bound (Theorem 1.2) that consumes the bulk of our eﬀort. Let us point out here
that Theorem 1.2 is the only place where Assumption (3) is crucially used.

By virtue of Lemma 1.3, we now have to deal with potential double roots with low algebraic
degree, more precisely, with degree at most C0 log n. In the next lemma we show that the probability
that P has a root at an algebraic numbers of low degree such that one of its conjugates lying at a
distance of at least Ω((log n)−1) from the unit circle is negligible.
Lemma 1.4 (low degree roots far away from the unit circle). For every B > 0 and C0 > 0, there
exists C1 > 0 such that

P(cid:16)P has a root α : deg(α) ≤ C0 log n and Λ(α) > 1 + C1

log n(cid:17) = O(e− Bn

log n ).

For the proof, we use a simple sparsiﬁcation of P to bound the root probability for each ﬁxed
low-degree algebraic number lying far away from the unit circle and then employ a rather crude
union bound. After Lemma 1.4, we next deal with the low degree double roots with small house
(i.e. all of their conjugates lying close to the unit circle). We break this into two cases. First we
consider the case when the degree of the root is at least 5 and we show that

Lemma 1.5 (low degree roots close to the unit circle). For every C0 > 0 and C1 > 0, we have

P(cid:16)P has a root α : 4 < deg(α) ≤ C0 log n and Λ(α) ≤ 1 + C1

log n(cid:17) = o(n−2).

From a standard application of inverse Littlewood-Oﬀord type results, it follows that for any
ﬁxed algebraic number α of degree at least 5, P(P (α) = 0) = Oε(n−5/2+ε), for any ε > 0. This
is shown in Lemma 5.1. More importantly, to prove Lemma 1.5, we need to count the number of
algebraic numbers α such that deg(α) ≤ C0 log n and Λ(α) ≤ 1 + C1
log n . Towards this direction, we
show in Lemma 5.2 that they are at most o(nε) in number for any ε > 0. The counting estimate
makes heavy use of a result of Dubickas [6].

Finally, the next lemma takes care of the potential double roots that have degree at most 4

(excluding 0,±1) and have small house.
Lemma 1.6 (roots with degree at most 4). For every C0 > 0 and C1 > 0, we have

P(cid:16)P has a double root α 6= 0,±1 : deg(α) ≤ 4 and Λ(α) ≤ 1 + C1

log n(cid:17) = o(n−2)

4

OHAD N. FELDHEIM AND ARNAB SEN

It is not hard to see that if α is a root of P for large enough n satisfying the conditions that
deg(α) = O(1) and Λ(α) = o(1), then it must be a unimodular root, i.e., all of the conjugates
of α must lie on the unit circle. Now if α is a root of unity, we closely follow [13] to bound the
probability of having a double root α which involves an application of an anti-concentration bound
due to S´ark¨ozi and Szemer´edi [14]. However, when α is unimodular but not a root of unity, we need
a new argument to bound the probability of having a double root at α. In fact, in Lemma 6.1 we
show that P(P (α) = 0) = O(n−5/2). The argument relies on a powerful anti-concentration bound
by Hal´asz [8].

Clearly, the ﬁrst assertion of Theorem 1.1 is an immediate consequence of lemmata 1.3, 1.4,
1.5, 1.6. To prove the second assertion of Theorem 1.1 , note that since P (ξ0 = 0) = 0, with
probability one, P can not have a root at 0. So, we need to show that
P(P has a double root at ± 1) = O(n−2).

The above bound follows from an application of optimal inverse Littlewood-Oﬀord theorem [18,
Theorem 2.5]. For details, see Lemma A.5 in [4] where the same has been proved under the
assumption that ξ0 has bounded (2 + ε) moment. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.

2. Anti-concentration of P (±2)

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2. As an important ﬁrst step, we will ﬁnd a very useful a

Clearly, the necessary part of Proposition 2.1 is trivial. Most of the reminder of Section 2 is

We write M for the collection of non-negative ﬁnite measures µ on the integers (including the null
measure), which satisfy wµ
1 ≤ µ(Z)/2. Also, for any non-null ﬁnite measure µ on Z, we denote by
¯µ the normalized probability measure ¯µ(·) := µ(·)/µ(Z).

To prove Proposition 2.1 we use the following couple of lemmata.

Lemma 2.2. If µ ∈ M is non-null and µ is supported on at most 3 integers, then ¯µ is a mixture
of at most 3 Bernoulli measures.

Proof. We write

¯µ = w1δπ1 + w2δπ2 + w3δπ3

where w1 ≥ w2 ≥ w3 andP3
µ = (w1 + w2 − w3)(cid:16) 1

2 δπ1 + 1

i=1 wi = 1. We then give the explicit decomposition:

2 δπ1 + 1

2 δπ3(cid:17) + (w2 + w3 − w1)(cid:16) 1

2 δπ3(cid:17).

It is now straightforward to check that each of the weights is non-negative and that equality

indeed holds.

Proof of Proposition 2.1. Write µ1 for the distribution of ξ. Deﬁne a decreasing sequence of ﬁnite
measures (µi)i∈N on Z inductively as follows. Suppose µi has already been deﬁned and µi ∈ M.
An application of Lemma 2.3 to µi with k = 4 yields the decomposition µi = βi + µi+1 with
µi+1(πµi
4 ) = 0 where βi is either the null measure or ¯βi is a Bernoulli measure and µi+1 ∈ M. This
deﬁnes the measure µi+1. Since (µi)i∈N is a decreasing sequence of ﬁnite measures, it has a limiting
measure (possibly null) which we denote by µ∞. Thus we write

µ =Xi∈N

βi + µ∞.

integers, and then apply Lemma 2.2.

All that remains in order to prove the proposition is to show that µ∞ is supported on at most 3
To that end, assume, if possible that, there exists four distinct integers a1, a2, a3, a4 such that

µ∞(ai) > 0 for all i. Set c := min{µ∞(ai) : 1 ≤ i ≤ 4} > 0. For each i ∈ N, deﬁne the set

Li := {x ∈ Z : µi(x) ≥ c}.

Since µi ↓ µ∞, Li ⊇ Li+1 and a1, . . . , a4 ∈ Li for each i. Thus πµi
4 ∈ Li and hence, by the deﬁnition
of the measure µi+1, we have Li ⊆ Li+1 \ {πµi
4 }. This implies that |Li+1| < |Li| for each i. Since
|L1| < ∞, this contradicts the fact that |Li| ≥ 4 for each i. Hence, µ∞ is supported on at most 3
integers.

Using Proposition 2.1 we may reduce Theorem 1.2 to the following proposition.

we ﬁx a sign sequence (σi)1≤i≤n with σi = ±1. In the course of the proof we shall make several
claims whose proofs are given in sections 2.3 and 2.4.
For k ∈ Z we write L(k) for the leading power of 2 in the factorization of k, i.e., L(k) = max{l ∈
Z+ : 2l divides k}. Since (Xi)1≤i≤n are i.i.d. Bernoulli mixtures, following the representation (5),
we can express Xi as

Xi = Ii + Bi∆i,

where (Ii, ∆i)1≤i≤n are i.i.d. random vectors in Z × N and (Bi)1≤i≤n are i.i.d. Ber( 1

Claim 2.5. Let (Bi)1≤i≤n be i.i.d. Ber( 1
2 ) random variables and let (bi)1≤i≤n and (di)1≤i≤n be any
two sequences of integers. Then

Applying Claim 2.5 we have,

P(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:12){L(2i∆i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}(cid:12)(cid:12) = s(cid:17)2−s ≤ 2−n(1/2+ε).

Observing that L(2iσi∆i) = L(2i∆i) for all i, it would suﬃce to show that for large enough n

we have,

Here and in the rest of the proof we let ε be a small positive constant, chosen to satisfy various
constraints which are speciﬁed along the proof.

Taking wi := L(∆i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and W := |{i + wi

By rewriting the LHS of (6) as

P(cid:0)W = s(cid:1)2−s + Xn(1/2+ε)≤s≤n

Plugging (7) into (6) we get that it would be enough to show the existence of ε > 0 such that for
large enough n,

In order to show (8), we use the following lemma.

Lemma 2.6. Let (wi)1≤i≤n be i.i.d. non-negative integer-valued random variables, and deﬁne W =

αn(cid:19)αn ≤(cid:18) α

P(cid:16)W = αn(cid:17) ≤ e−ε′n(cid:18) α

1 − α(cid:19)n(1−α)

.

Proving Lemma 2.6 is the main technical step in the proof of Proposition 2.4, and we devote

Section 2.4 to its proof.

The following claim, whose proof we delay to Section 2.3, captures two technical properties of

the bound obtained in Lemma 2.6.

Claim 2.7. For n ∈ N, we deﬁne a function fn : (0, 1) → R+ as
2n(1/2−α).

fn(α) :=(cid:18) α

1 − α(cid:19)n(1−α)

Then the following hold.
(a) There exists c0 > 1/2 such that fn(α) is strictly monotone increasing in (0, c0).
(b) Let c0 be as in part (a). Then for any c > 0 there exists 0 < δ < c0− 1

2 +δ) < 2cn.
Finally we are fully equipped to demonstrate the existence of ε > 0 such that (8) holds. Let δ′, ε′
be as in part (b) of Lemma 2.6 and let c0 be as in part (a) of Claim 2.7. By part (b) of Claim 2.7,
ε′n
applied to c = ε′/2, we get that there exists δ ∈ (0, c0 − 1
2 . We take
ε := min(c0 − 1
2 ). We are thus left with verifying (8).

Applying Part (a) of Lemma 2.6 and part (a) of Claim 2.7, we get that,

We remark that if our interest was limited to obtaining the theorem for the case ε = 0, it would
have been possible to use only the ﬁrst part of Lemma 2.6, which is, as will become evident, easier
to obtain.

that the values of L(d1), L(d2), . . . , L(dk) are distinct and moreover, L(d1) < L(d2) < ··· < L(dk).

Proof of Claim 2.7. Notice that fn(α) = f1(α)n, and f1(α) > 0 for all α ∈ (0, 1). For Part (a) it is

Thus (19) is satisﬁed with η := 1

Next, we show that W is concentrated around its expectation. To this end we use the concentra-
tion properties of self-bounding functions of independent variables. We write f (w1, . . . , wn) := W ,
gi(w1, . . . , wi−1, wi+1, . . . , wn) := |{wj + j : 1 ≤ j ≤ n, j 6= i}|, and observe that for all i ≤ n we
have,

f (w1, . . . , wn) − gi(w1, . . . , wi−1, wi+1, . . . , wn) ≤ 1.

nXi=1(cid:16)f (w1, . . . , wn) − gi(w1, . . . , wi−1, wi+1, . . . , wn)(cid:17) ≤ f (w1, . . . , wn).

We shall also use the following bound on the probability that P has a root in close proximity to

Denote by B(z0, r) the closed ball in C with center at z0 and radius r.

Lemma 3.3. For any constant B > 0, there exists K > 0 such that

P(cid:16)P has a zero in B(2, n−K) ∪ B(−2, n−K)(cid:17) = O(n−B).

Finally, we need a preliminary claim, bounding the number of roots far away from the unit circle.

Claim 3.4. Let M ∈ N. For any n ≥ 1 and any non-zero polynomial f in Z[x] of the form
i=0 aizi with |ai| ≤ M for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the number of zeros of f with modulus at least 3
is at most 64M .

f (z) =Pn
Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that |an| 6= 0. Let ˜f (z) = znf (z−1) =Pn
i=0 aizn−i be
the reciprocal polynomial of f . Denote by N (f ) the number of z ∈ C for which f (z) = 0 and
2 . Then N (f ) is also the number of z ∈ C for which ˜f (z) = 0 and |z| ≤ 2
|z| ≥ 3

| ˜f (0)| = |an| ≥ 1 we may apply Jensen’s formula (see, e.g., [1, Chapter 5.3.1]) and obtain for any

Proof of Proposition 3.1. Fix 1 ≤ d ≤ n. Let α be an algebraic number of degree deg(α) = d
and let fα be the associated minimal poly of α in Z[x]. Suppose that α is a double root of P . Note
that α cannot be a multiple root of fα, since, otherwise, α is also a root of the polynomial f′α whose
degree is strictly smaller than d, violating the deﬁnition of deg(α). This implies that f 2
α divides P
in Z[x] (by Gauss’s lemma). In particular,

the integer P (a) is divisible by fα(a)2,

for a = ±2.

(23)

Next we obtain a suitable lower bound for max{|fα(2)|,|fα(−2)|}. Denote by C(α) the set of
algebraic conjugates of α (i.e., the set of roots of fα). Each of these conjugates of α must also be
a root of P . So, by Claim 3.4, all but at most 64M of the β ∈ C(α) satisfy |β| ≥ 3

have

E be the event that there is at least one root of P within a distance of n−K from either −2 or 2.
Note that the event E does not depend on α. On the event E c,

identical. Set C1 = ⌈log3 M⌉. Deﬁne a subset of indices J as

4. Roots far from the unit circle

In this section we prove Lemma 1.4. We begin by obtaining the following bound on the probability

that P has a particular root α far from the unit circle.

P(cid:16)P (α) = 0(cid:17) ≤ exp(cid:16)−

n log 2

⌈log(M + 1)/| log |α||⌉(cid:17).

Proof. Assume that |α| > 1. Let ℓ be the minimal positive integer for which

|α|ℓ > M + 1.

Write P (z) = P1(z) + P2(z) with

Since |ξi| ≤ M for all i, the map

is one-to-one. Thus, as P1(α) and P2(α) are independent, we have

P(cid:16)P (α) = 0(cid:17) = EhP(cid:16)P (α) = 0(cid:17) | P2(α))i =

Assumption (3) and the deﬁnition of ℓ imply that

The case when |α| < 1 can be handled similarly. This proves the lemma.

(cid:3)

We also make the following simple observation.

Observation 4.1. Let α be a root of P . Then

(1) The leading coeﬃcient of the associated minimal polynomial of α in Z[x] is at most M ,
(2) Λ(α) ≤ M + 1.

Proof. Write fα for the associated minimal polynomial of α in Z[x] and denote the leading coeﬃcient
of fα by mα. By Gauss’s lemma (see, e.g., [2, Proposition 3.4]), fα|P in Z[x] and, in particular,
mα, the leading coeﬃcient of P , divides ξn. Since |ξn| ≤ M, we get that mα ≤ M .

The fact that Λ(α) ≤ M + 1 is a direct consequence of Rouch´e Theorem.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 1.4. Let us ﬁrst estimate the number of algebraic numbers α such that α is a root
of some random polynomial P of degree n and deg(α) ≤ C0 log n. Write fα for the associated
minimal polynomial of α in Z[x] and denote, as usual, the leading coeﬃcient of fα by mα.
If
α1 = α, α2,··· , αdeg(α) are conjugates of α, we can express fα as

Therefore, by Observation 4.1, we have following crude bound on the coeﬃcients of fα,

ajxn−j.

deg(α)Xj=0

log n , then

max
α∈A

for some C′ > 0 depending on C0 and M . Since aj has to be an integer, there are at most eC log2 n
possibilities for fα(x) for some constant C > 0.

Now, by Lemma 4.1, if α ∈ A with Λ(α) > 1 + C1

A simple union bound over such α (or, more precisely, over the minimal polynomials fα) yields the
lemma.
(cid:3)

5. Roots near the Unit circle

In this section we prove Lemma 1.5. Recall that for α ∈ A, mα denotes the leading coeﬃcient
of the associated minimal polynomial of α in Z[x]. Fix C0, C1 > 0. By Observation 4.1, we need
consider for Lemma 1.5 the following set of potential roots of P .

To prove Lemma 1.5, we employ the following union bound

A :=nα ∈ A : 4 < deg(α) ≤ C0 log n and Λ(α) ≤ 1 + C1
P(cid:16)P (α) = 0(cid:17)

P(cid:16)∃α ∈ A : P (α) = 0(cid:17) ≤ |A| · max

and then proceed to provide upper bounds on maxα∈A P(cid:0)P (α) = 0(cid:1) and on the cardinality of the set

A. This is done using Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 below, whose proofs are presented in Sections 5.1
and 5.2 respectively.

Lemma 5.1. Let α be an algebraic number of degree at least 5. Then for every ǫ > 0 there exists
C > 0 such that

P(P (α) = 0) ≤ Cn− 5

(31)

For any polynomial f ∈ Z[x], let Λ(f ) be the maximum modulii of the roots of f .

Lemma 5.2 (counting integral polynomials with small houses). Let b > 0 and let a ∈ N. Then,
for all d suﬃciently large, the number of polynomials f ∈ Z[x] of degree d with leading coeﬃcient a
such that

is less than exp((ad)2/3+b).

Λ(f ) < 1 +

ad

Note that for every algebraic number α ∈ A, its associated minimal polynomial in Z[x] has
degree at most C0 log n and its leading coeﬃcient is bounded by M . Applying Lemma 5.2 to each
a ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M} and each degree 1 ≤ d ≤ C1 log n with b = 1

6 , we obtain that for every ǫ > 0,

Plugging (31) and (32) into (30), the Lemma 1.5 follows.

|A| = o(nǫ).

5.1. Each root of low degree is unlikely. In this section we prove Lemma 5.1. The proof follows
closely the proof of [10, Lemma 1] adapted for our case (that is, when the random variables ξi’s are
not Bernoulli random variables). The main ingredient of the proof is the ‘inverse Littlewood-Oﬀord
type theorem” of Tao and Vu [15, Theorem 1.9], whose specialization for our case is the following.
Theorem 5.3 (Tao and Vu (2010)). Let (ηi)0≤i≤n be i.i.d. Ber( 1

Then there exists a symmetric generalized arithmetic progression (GAP), all of whose elements are

Recall that in our context a symmetric GAP Q of rank r is a set of the form

Q =( rXi=1

where the dimensions N = (N1, N2, . . . , Nr) are r-tuple of positive integers and the steps u =
(u1, u2, . . . , ur) are r-tuple of elements in C. In particular, if v1 . . . , vr+1 are elements of a GAP of

Proposition 2.1 allows us to represent the random variable ξj as ξj = Ij + ∆jηj where (Ij, ∆j)0≤j≤n
are i.i.d. random vectors taking values in Z × N and (ηj)0≤j≤n are i.i.d. Ber( 1
2 ), independent of
(Ij, ∆j)0≤j≤n. Conditioning on (Ij, ∆j)0≤j≤n yields

P(P (α) = 0) = EP(cid:0) nXj=0

From (34) and (35), it follows that there exists a vector (d0, d1, . . . , dn) ∈ Nn+1 such that

We now apply Theorem 5.3 with A = 5

2 and zj = djαj to obtain a symmetric GAP Q
of rank B ≤ 2A < 5 such that all but O(√n) many of the coeﬃcients djαj belong to Q. Therefore,
for large enough n, there exists j0 ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n} for which dj0+kαj0+k ∈ Q for all k = 0, 1, . . . , 4.
Since the rank of Q is at most 4, there exists a nontrivial integer linear combination that annihilates
the vector (dj0+kαj0+k)0≤k≤4. Hence the algebraic degree of α is at most 4, in contradiction with
our assumption. Hence, the lemma follows.

Proof of Lemma 5.2. The proof of the lemma is an adaptation of the proof of [6, Theorem 1] of
Dubickas to the case of non-monic polynomials. Fix b > 0, and write Fa,d for the collection of
polynomials f ∈ Z[x] of degree d with leading coeﬃcient a which satisfy

Let

S = {(α1(f ), . . . , αd(f )) : f ∈ Fa,d}.

From (37) and from the deﬁnition of Fa,d, we deduce that the set S is (a, d) admissible. To conclude
the proof we bound the maximal size of any (a, d) admissible set.
In [6, Theorem 2], Dubickas
obtained such a bound for the special case when a = 1 using an elementary but clever application
of volume formulas of polytopes, and classical estimates on the number of Gauss integers in a circle.

Theorem 5.5 (Dubickas, 1999). The size of any (1, ℓ) admissible set is Ob(exp(ℓ2/3+b)).

We now use Dubickas’ result as a blackbox to bound the cardinality of (a, d) admissible set. Let

W be an (a, d) admissible set, and writecW for the image of W in Cad under the repetition map

6. Unimodular roots with bounded degree

In this section we will prove Lemma 1.6. Note that there are only ﬁnitely many irreducible
polynomials in Z[x] of degree at most 4 with leading coeﬃcients bounded by M in absolute value
whose roots are all within distance M + 1 from the origin. In particular, for large enough n, all
such polynomials whose roots are in distance 1 + C1
M from the origin, have, in fact, all roots on the
unit circle. Thus to prove the lemma it would suﬃce to show that for any ﬁxed α ∈ A on the unit
circle such that deg(α) ≤ 4 and α 6= ±1,

P(α is a double root of P ) = o(n−2),

(38)

Lemma 1.6 will then follow by applying a simple union bound. If α is an algebraic integer, then it
has to be a root of unity if α and all of its conjugates lie on the unit circle. However, in general,
there are examples of algebraic numbers such that all of their conjugates are on the unit circle yet
they are not roots of unity. For example, consider the quadratic polynomial 3x2− x + 3 whose roots
are 1±√−35
. In fact, any polynomial Pm
i=0 bixi in Z[x] that is self-reciprocal (i.e., bi = bm−i ∀ i)
2Pm−1
which satisﬁes the condition |bm| > 1
k=1 |bk| has all its root on the unit circle [16]. Thus, ﬁrst
begin by addressing roots which lie on the unit circle but which are not root of unity.
Lemma 6.1 (unimodular roots that are not roots of unity). Let α ∈ A be such that |α| = 1 but α
is not a root of unity (i.e., αm 6= 1 for all m ∈ N). Then under Assumption 3,

The proof of Lemma 6.1 is a straightforward application of the following well-known result due

to Hal´asz (see [17, Corollary 7.16], [19, Corllary 6.3 and Remark 3.5]).

P(cid:0)P (α) = 0(cid:1) = O(n−5/2).

Lemma 6.2 (Hal´asz). Let G be an inﬁnite Abelian group. Let m ≥ 1 and a1, a2, . . . , am ∈ G and
let ε1, ε2, . . . , εm be i.i.d. with P(εj = 1) = P(εj = 0) = 1/2. Fix ℓ ∈ N and let Rℓ be the number of
solutions of the equation ai1 + ai2 + ··· + aiℓ = aj1 + aj2 + ··· + ajℓ. Then

Proof of Lemma 6.1. Applying Proposition 2.1 can represent the random variables (ξj)0≤j≤n as
ξj = Ij + ∆jεj where (Ij, ∆j)0≤j≤n are i.i.d. random vectors taking values in Z× N and (εj)0≤j≤n’s
are i.i.d. Ber( 1

by T = {0 ≤ j ≤ n : ∆j = q}. Again, conditioning on (εj)j6∈T , write

We are left with showing that for any deterministic set of indices T ⊆ {0, 1, . . . , n}, we have

Applying Hal´asz’s result (Lemma 6.2) with coeﬃcients (αj)j∈T in C and ℓ = 2, we count the number
of solutions of the equation

αi + αj = αk + αl,

(39)
where i, j, k, l are arbitrary indices in T . Taking the absolute value on the both sides of (39) and
using the fact that |α| = 1, we have |1 + αj−i| = |1 + αl−k|, which implies that either αj−i = αl−k
or αj−i = αk−l, or equivalently j − i = ±(l − k). In case that j − i = l − k, we may write (39) as
αi(1 + αj−i) = αk(1 + αj−i), or equivalently as (αi − αk)(1 + αj−i) = 0. Since α is not a root of
unity, then 1 + αj−1 6= 0. So, we deduce that αi = αk which implies that i = k. Plugging it in
back in j − i = l − k, we also have j = l. Similarly, for the case j − i = k − l, we end up with the
equation (αi − αl)(1 + αj−i) = 0, which, in turn, implies that i = l and j = k. Hence, we conclude
that R2 ≤ 2|T|2 and the claim follows.

From the claim, we obtain that

probability η. From the standard result on the concentration of Binomial random variable, we

know that there exists a constant c > 0, depending on η, such that P(cid:16)|T| ≤ η

Lemma 6.3 (roots of unity). Suppose Assumption 3 holds. Then there exist constants c, C > 0

The proof of the above lemma is very similar to that of Lemma 1.4 in [13] where the similar
bound holds without the additional k exp(−c⌊ n
k⌋) term for any non-constant coeﬃcient distribu-
tion supported on {−1, 0, 1}. However, for the sake of completeness we include here a proof of
Lemma 6.3. The proof of Lemma 6.3 relies heavily on the following classical anti-concentration
bound of S´ark¨ozi and Szemer´edi [14].
Theorem 6.4 (S´ark¨ozi and Szemer´edi). Let (εj)1≤j≤N be i.i.d. Ber( 1

Observe that necessarily deg(α) ≤ k. Set

Conditionally on (∆j)1≤j≤n, deﬁne the random variables (Sr), 0 ≤ r ≤ deg(α) − 1, by

J := {j : 1 ≤ j ≤ n and 0 ≤ (j − 1) mod k ≤ deg(α) − 1},

2⌊ n
It remains to show (38). Let α ∈ A such that |α| = 1, α 6∈ {−1, 1} and deg(α) ≤ 4. First assume
that α is a primitive kth root of unity, that is, αk = 1 and αl 6= 1 for all positive integer l < k. Recall
that deg(α) = ϕ(k) where ϕ is Euler’s totient function, i.e., ϕ(k) = |{1 ≤ j ≤ k : gcd(j, k) = 1}|
(see, for example, Lemma 7.6 and Theorem 7.7 of [12]). By standard estimates (see [11, Theorem
2.9]) there exists some constant c1 > 0 for which

The above bound along with the fact that deg(α) ≤ 4 implies the bound k ≤ C2 for some absolute
constant C2. On the other hand, since α 6= ±1, we have deg(α) ≥ 2. Thus, by Lemma 6.3, we
deduce that P(α is a double root of P ) = O(n−3).
Now assume that α is not a root of unity. As a direct consequence of Lemma 6.1, we also have
that P(α is a double root of P ) = O(n−5/2). This ﬁnishes the proof of the bound (38) and hence
the proof of Lemma 1.6.

7. Open Problems

We conclude the paper with a couple of open problems.

(1) Deﬁne pn+1 := maxa∈Z P(cid:16)Pn(2) = a(cid:17). Then
P(cid:16) m−1Xj=0

P(cid:16)Pn+m−1(2) = a(cid:17) ≥ max

pn+m = max
a∈Z

a∈Z

ξj2j = a(cid:17) max

a∈Z

P(cid:16) m+n−1Xj=m

ξj2j = a(cid:17) = pmpn.

So, it follows from the subadditive property that there exists some λ > 0, depending on the
law of ξ0, such that pn = e−λn(1+o(1)). However, the exact value of λ is completely unknown.
In the special case when the maximum of atom of ξ0 is at most 1
2 , our Theorem 1.2 only gives
a one-sided bound λ > 1
2 log 2 . It would be very interesting to investigate the dependence
of value of λ on the law of ξ0 or, say, on the maximum atom of ξ0.

(2) It would be very interesting to investigate the minimum gap between the roots of a random
polynomial. Note that this problem makes sense even if the coeﬃcient distribution is
continuous. To best of our knowledge, precise quantitive bounds on the minimum gap are
not available even for the i.i.d. Gaussian polynomials.

The authors are very grateful to Ron Peled for numerous helpful conversations and, in particular,

for pointing out the reference [6]. The authors also thank Ofer Zeitouni for insightful comments.
