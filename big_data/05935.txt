An action formalism is developed for the perfect ﬂuid in the Eulerian framework, where theoretical
ﬂaws related with the Clebsch parametrization are removed. The proposed formalism naturally leads
us to interactions of 2 types. One is the gauge interaction on the Clebsch potentials, which yields
the non-Abelian (Abelian) ﬂuid dynamics in a pure manner of the gauge principle. The other is the
interaction on the velocity potentials which convert the rest-mass energy to energies of other ﬁelds
and vise versa.

Introduction.– The action principle, a soul concept in
various branches of theoretical physics, is still in the de-
velopment for ﬂuid mechanics in spite of its long history
of study. Incompleteness arises in the Eulerian descrip-
tion of rotational ﬂow; unlike the Lagrangian-coordinate
framework, the action in the Eulerian description re-
quires the Clebsch parametrization [1–8] of the ﬂuid ve-
locity v, where v is represented as a linear combination
of scalar gradients

v = −∇φ − s∇ψ −

ρ

n

Iβ∇ Iα,

(1)

where φ is the velocity potential, s is the speciﬁc en-
tropy, ψ is the thermasy [4] and ρ is the mass density.
The remaining αs and βs correspond to the Clebsch po-
tentials which are essential for rotational ﬂow [9], n is an
arbitrary positive integer. The Clebsch parametrization
closely relates to constraints in its Lagrangian density:

L = L0 + ρDφ + ρsDψ +

n

XI=1

IβD Iα,

(2)

where D(≡ ∂t + vj ∂j) is the convective derivative. The
free part L0 ≡ 1
2 ρvjvj − U (ρ, s) (U ; internal energy) is
constrained by conservation of ρ, ρs, and Iβ [3, 6–8, 10–
14]. Before going any further, two shortcomings of this
formulation must be addressed. (I) Clebsh parametriza-
tion includes extra degrees of freedom of the Lagrange
multipliers (φ, ψ, and α) of added constraints, which
Schutz (1978) expresses as “too many” and pointed out
the necessity of action principle with minimum number
of variables [8]. (II) Physical interpretation of Clebsch
potentials is still controversial; some identify them as the
Lagrangian-coordinate variables [6, 7, 11], some explain
them from Chern-Simon like gauge [12–14]. Yet, no con-
clusive agreement on the nature of the potentials has
been reached [15].
In any event, any candidate formu-
lation of the action principle in ﬂuid mechanics should
naturally account for the points described above.

In this paper, we propose an action formalism which
settles the ambiguities in the Eulerian description of the

perfect ﬂuid. The proposed action needs only half of
the scalar variables required in the conventional formal-
ism, where the other half are reproduced as canonical
conjugate quantities. As a natural consequence, con-
straints on mass, entropy, and Clebsch potentials do not
appear. The formulation contains a natural generaliza-
tion of the Clebsch parametrization, allowing the intro-
duction of new interactions. One is the gauge interaction
on the Clebsch potentials, which yields non-Abelian ﬂuid
mechanics [10, 16] in a self-consistent manner, where we
ﬁnd the Clebsch potentials describe the charge density
corresponding to SU (n)-gauge symmetry. The other is
the interaction based on the velocity potential, which
convert the rest-mass energy to energies of other types.
Non-relativistic ﬂuid.– Let us start from the non-
relativistic case. We ﬁrst revisit the convection eﬀect
which may be the most characteristic feature of a ﬂuid.
Unlike the other physical ﬁelds, a ﬂuid (or, generally
speaking, continuum) is based on the velocity ﬁeld by
which various physical properties are convected; mass,
electric charge, and other thermodynamic quantities are
convected by this vector ﬁeld with their current in the
form of ρconvv, where ρconv is the density of convective
quantities. Let us consider an action which derives such

convection eﬀect: S[φ, v] = R dtR LF (Dφ)d3x, where φ

is a real scalar ﬁeld; namely the Lagrangian density LF
is given by a real function of Dφ. The Euler-Lagrange
equations are given by

= −∂t

∂LF
∂(Dφ)

−(cid:18) ∂LF

∂(Dφ)

vj(cid:19) ,j = 0

δS
δφ
δS
δvj =

φ,j = 0.

(3a)

(3b)

Eq. (3a) shows the conservation of a convective quan-
tity ∂LF /∂(Dφ). Eq. (3b) suggests that φ may serve
as a potential function to v.
Indeed by incorporating
a quadratic term V(≡ 1
2 vava) into the action, namely
LF (Dφ, V), Eq. (3b) is modiﬁed as a velocity-potential
relation

δS
δvj =

∂LF
∂(Dφ)

φ,j +

∂LF
∂V

vj = 0.

This becomes exactly the potential relation v = −∇φ
when the Langrangian density shares the same depen-
dance in both V and Dφ, i.e. ∂LF /∂V = ∂LF /∂(Dφ).
One could relax this condition so that they are propor-
tional to each other, in this case by rescaling φ in the
equations above we keep the potential relation intact.
Alternatively, we introduce a new quantity ˜Dφ as

˜Dφ = Dφ +

2

M vava,

(4)

and rewrite the Lagrangian density as LF ( ˜Dφ), where
M is a constant. ˜Dφ, to be referred as the kernel here-
after, plays the central role in the later discussions. The
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations read

δS

δvj =

∂LF
∂( ˜Dφ)

(φ,j + M vj) = 0,

(5a)

(5b)

where convection of ∂LF /∂ ˜Dφ and the potential rela-
tion are obtained. Note that Lagrangian density LF ( ˜Dφ)
with the kernel (4) provides the minimum model for a
perfect ﬂuid. The spatial gradient of LF ( ˜Dφ) yields

∂iLF ( ˜Dφ) =

∂LF
∂( ˜Dφ)

∂LF
∂( ˜Dφ)

(vi,t + vi,j vj)

⇔ M

∂LF
∂( ˜Dφ)

(vi,t + vi,jvj ) = −LF ,i,

(6)

where we used Eq. (5b). Eq. (6) is the Euler equation
where M ∂LF /∂ ˜Dφ and LF behave as the mass density
and the pressure respectively. For more clarity, we intro-
duce the canonical momentum of φ as

π =

∂LF
∂φ,t

=

∂LF

∂( ˜Dφ) (cid:16)≡ f ( ˜Dφ)(cid:17) .

Here we shall choose the functional form of LF so that
the inverse function F (≡ f −1); π 7→ ˜Dφ exists; namely,
˜Dφ = F (π). Then the thermodynamic relation between
pressure LF and mass M π is given by (LF ◦ F )(π).
Thus LF ( ˜Dφ) with the kernel (4) describes an irrota-
tional barotropic ﬂuid whose pressure is determined only
by mass density M π. Note that LF is cyclic in φ; it
contains only space-time derivatives of φ, not φ itself so
that its canonical conjugate π naturally conserves as Eq.
(5a), which leads to the conservation of M π.

Rotational non-barotropic ﬂuid is described by the
Lagrangian density LF ( ˜Dφ) with a multiple-component
kernel ˜Dφ given by

˜Dφ = Dφ +

Mvava + C(Dα).

Here φ and α are m- and n-component real scalars re-
spectively, C is a m-component real function of Dα, M
is m-component constant (m 6= n in general):

φ = (1φ, 2φ, · · · , mφ)T , α = (1α, 2α, · · · , nα, )T ,

C = (1C, 2C, · · · , mC)T , M = (1M, 2M, · · · , mM )T ,

where T attached on the right-top side means the trans-
position of matrix components. Hereafter, vectors such
as φ (φT ) are regarded as column (row) vectors, while
the derivative operations such as ∂/∂φ (∂/∂φT ) as rows
(columns). We have two canonical conjugates π and β
given by

where h(≡ ∂C/∂Dα) is m × n matrix. The Euler-
Lagrange equations are given by

δvi = πT φ,i + βT α,i + MT πvi = 0,

(9a)

(9b)

(9c)

where Eq. (9c) is the generalization of Eq. (1). Taking
the spatial derivative of LF ( ˜Dφ) and combined with Eq.
(9c) yield

MT π(cid:0)vi,t + vi,jvj(cid:1) = −LF ,i,

(10)

where F; π 7→ ˜Dφ is the inverse of f. Now MT π behaves
as the mass density. Indeed, (9a) multiplied by M yields
the conservation law as follows:

∂t(MT π) + (MT πvj),j = 0.

Note that the pressure depends on multiple components
of π which may be regarded as the generalized thermo-
dynamic variables. α never aﬀects the thermodynamic
relation (LF ◦ F)(π) but it simply contributes to v as
shown in Eq.
(9c). The ﬂuid Lagrangian density can
be obtained through the computation of the canonical
Hamiltonian density which reads,

HF = πT φ,t + βT α,t − LF

FT (π′)dπ′ (generalized internal en-
HT (β′, π) dβ′ (energy of the Cleb-

h for ﬁxed π. For a special case of m = 2 with a setting
M = (1, 0)T , Eq. (12) is reduced to

From Noether’s ﬁrst theorem, we have T µν
;ν = 0 which
is equivalent to Eq. (16). Now MT π|w|2 and LF act
as the inertial mass density and the pressure respec-
tively; namely the mass density is to be deﬁned by
ρ ≡ MT π|w|2 − LF . Multiplying Eq. (15a) by M yields

(13)

which may be interpreted as the conservation of the rest-
mass density ρ0(≡ MT π|w|) (|w| is the speciﬁc inertial
mass). Eq. (16) is rewritten as the equation for u:

where φ = (φ, ψ)T and π = (ρ, ρs)T . With the exception
of UC , Eq. (13) is identical to that of the conventional-
type Lagrangian density in Eq. (2). The extra UC term
does not bring any novelty since it does not play a role in
the observable dynamics [17], however, it is highly non-
trivial that the last three terms are not added constraints
as in Eq. (2) but naturally emerge through a Legendre
transformation LF [φ, α] → HF [φ, π, α, β]. It should be
emphasized that there is no reason a priori as to why
m and M should take these particular values or LF to
become Eq. (13) for that matter.

Relativistic ﬂuid.– Next, let us generalize the above
formalism to the relativistic case. For this purpose, we

search for the ﬂuid action in ﬂat-space S = R LF ( ˜Dφ)d4x

(we adopt metric signature: gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1)).
Replacing the non-relativistic velocity v with a four-
dimensional time-like vector w, the relativistic kernel is
introduced as follows:

˜Dφ = Dφ +

1
2

Mwαwα + C(Dα),

(14)

where D ≡ wα∂α. In the later discussions we employ the
Greek alphabets for the indices of space-time coordinates.
The Euler-Lagrange equations are given by

δS
δφT = − (πwµ) ,µ = 0,
δS
= − (βwµ) ,µ = 0,
δαT
δS
δwµ = πT φ,µ + βT α,µ + MT πwµ = 0,

(15a)

(15b)

(15c)

where πT ≡ ∂LF /∂( ˜Dφ), βT ≡ πT ∂C/∂(Dα) [18]. Tak-
ing the four-gradient of LF ( ˜Dφ) and combined with Eq.
(15c) yields

MT πwµ,ν wν = −LF ,µ,

(16)

which describes the dynamics of w. Using a normalized
vector u(≡ w/|w|) (uαuα = 1), the energy-momentum
tensor is given by

T µ

(17)

{(ρ + LF )uµuν},ν = −LF ,µ,

(19)

where the thermodynamic relation for pressure is given
by (LF ◦ F)(π).

Let us now consider interaction with other ﬁelds.
These may be divided into two categories; interactions
on φ and α.

1. Interaction on α: Among various possible inter-
actions, here we consider coupling to the gauge sector.
Let α be a SU (n) multiplet, and impose invariance of
the Lagrangian density under SU (n) transformations of
α, where the conjugate β is also a multiplet deﬁned by
β† ≡ πT ∂C/∂(Dα) while φ and M are just multiple-
component real scalars.
In order to incorporate gauge
symmetry into the theory, the associated kernel (14) it-
self must be invariant under local-gauge transformations.
This implies on the one hand, quadratic dependance on
Dα, i.e. C(Υ) with Υ ≡ (Dα)† Dα. And on the other,
that derivatives at kernel to be modiﬁed according to
D(= wν ∂ν → wν Dν), where Dµ ≡ ∂µ − ietaAa
µ is the
gauge-covariant derivative (e, ta, and Aa
µ are the coupling
constant, generator, and gauge ﬁeld, a = 1, 2, · · · , n2−1).
The gauge coupling in the Clebsch term does not aﬀect
the conservation law (15a), so that the rest-mass con-
servation (18) again holds. SU (n)-charge current arises
from the gauge symmetry:

J µ

a = −ie|w|(cid:16)β† taα − α† taβ(cid:17) uµ.

(20)

Taking the four-gradient of LF ( ˜Dφ) yields

{(ρ + LF ) uµuν} ,ν = −LF ,µ + F a

µν J ν
a ,

(21)

ν,µ − Aa

µ,ν + ef a

µAc

bcAb

µν ≡ Aa

where F a
ν is the ﬁeld
strength, f abc is the structure constants of the Lie al-
gebra: [ta, tb] = ifabctc. The non-Abelian ﬂuid dynamics
is formulated in a purely ﬁeld-theoretic manner, while
it had been estimated from classical dynamics of the
electric-charged particle [10, 16, 19]. The non-abelian
ﬂuid Lagrangian follows by adding the corresponding
Yang-Mills kinetic term,

L = LF ( ˜Dφ) −

1
4

F µν
a F a

µν

(22)

with ﬂuid-gauge interaction contained at the kernel ˜Dφ.
The abelian ﬂuid (electric-charged ﬂuid in a normal
sense) is also consistently formulated by imposing the
U (1) symmetry on a complex scalar α.

2. Interaction on φ: As mentioned previously, the ﬂuid
Lagrangian LF is cyclic in φ. This is the exact reason for
rest-mass conservation and so, any interaction containing
φ breaks the conservation. An example of such interact-
ing model may be given by L = LF ( ˜Dφ) + U(φ), where
the kernel is given by Eq. (14). Taking the four-gradient
of LF , we obtain the Euler equation identical to Eq. (19).
Unlike Eq. (15a), π does not conserve, which causes the
breaking of the rest-mass conservation. One possible ex-
ample is Yukawa-type interaction U ∝ ¯ψψφ (φ is a single
scalar for simplicity) that convert the rest-mass energy of
ﬂuid to the energy of the Dirac ﬁeld. Gauge interaction
imposed on φ also leads to this situation, since the mini-
mal interaction includes φ itself multiplied by the gauge
ﬁeld.

Summary.– In this paper, we have provided a formu-
lation of the perfect ﬂuid in the Eulerian description.
In this Lagrangian density LF ( ˜Dφ) is a real function
only dependent on the kernel ˜Dφ composed by dynam-
ical ﬁelds (φ, α), velocity v and constants M. The
Clebsch parameterization is exactly formed by canonical-
conjugate pairs (φ, π) and (α, β), where only the (φ, α)
half are independent variables. This reduction of degrees
of freedom results in the reduction of constraints on ther-
modynamic variables and Clebsch potentials. The rela-
tivistic ﬂuid Lagrangian was discussed, where we consid-
ered interactions based on φ and α. For interaction on
α, we considered gauge interaction, where non-Abelian
(Abelian) gauge coupling yields the exact dynamical
equation (21) for non-Abelian (Abelian) ﬂuid without
any help of classical-particle substratum [10, 16, 19]. Eq.
(20) is simply interpreted that the degrees of freedom in
α are left for the gauge transformation and charge dis-
tribution, which may explain the arbitrariness of n (pair
number of Clebsch potentials); this feature allows ﬂuid to
couple with arbitrary SU (n) gauge ﬁeld. In case of inter-
action on φ, we have unfamiliar but interesting models
that describe creation and annihilation of the rest mass
even in the classical framework. Such mechanism may
be a natural consequence, since we do not postulate the
rest-mass conservation for the ﬁrst place.

Finally let us mention about ﬁeld quantization. Some
pioneers discussed about the quantum ﬁeld theory of
ﬂuid, where excitation of Lagrangian position of ﬂuid el-
ement is the target of quantization [21, 22]. Note that
the Lagrangian picture of ﬂuid implies the rest-mass con-
servation; each world line of a ﬂuid element running from

4

the past to future does not terminate at some points. The
present formalism, on the contrary, is formulated with-
out such picture, and is even able to describe the creation
and annihilation of the rest mass. This suggests the pos-
sibility of another quantum ﬁeld theory of very diﬀerent
type, where ﬂuid itself may be obtained as an excitation
from the vacuum due to interactions with matter and
gauge particles.
