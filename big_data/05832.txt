Abstract

In this work we focus on the technical details of the numerical simulations of the non-
thermal transient Swift J1644+57, whose emission is probably produced by a two-component
jet powered by a tidal disruption event. In this context we provide details of the coupling
between the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and the radiative transfer code. First,
we consider the technical demands of one-dimensional simulations of a fast relativistic jet,
and show to what extent (for the same physical parameters of the model) do the computed
light curves depend on the numerical parameters of the diﬀerent codes employed. In the
second part we explain the diﬃculties of computing light curves from axisymmetric two
dimensonal simulations and discuss a procedure that yields an acceptable tradeoﬀ between
the computational cost and the quality of the results.

Introduction

Tidal disruption events (TDE) of stars by massive black holes [1, 2, 3] provide one of the ways
to detect an inactive massive black hole in the center of a galaxy. Stars whose orbit brings them
too close to a black hole can be disrupted and a large fraction of their mass can be accreted.
This sudden accretion event is expected to produce a luminous UV and X-ray TDE ﬂare [4, 5].
It has recently been argued that TDEs can also produce jets [6, 7, 8]. These jets are expected
to be detectable due to their non-thermal emission, and in radio they are likely to appear as
transients that peak on the timescales of about a year [6, 9] after the tidal disruption.

Swift J1644+57 (SwJ1644 in the rest of the article) is a non-thermal transient detected
It is thought to be prototype of a jetted TDE (jTDE). Its
on March 28th. 2011 [10, 11, 12].
radio emission [13, 14, 15] is long-lived and complex. One of the ﬁrst attempts to explain the
radio emission of Swift J1644+57 using one-dimensional models and relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations[16] assumed that the emission is coming from the shocks that form when the jet
interacts with the circumnuclear medium (CNM). This model is more analogous to a GRB

afterglow than to an AGN1. While the model was successful in explaining the ﬁrst few weeks
of SwJ1644 radio emission, it turns out that the long-term emission is not easily accounted for
by a radio afterglow from a single ultrarelativistic, narrow jet. The reason for this is that the
source rebrightened after >
∼150 days, the time at which the afterglow model predicted a steady
decline[14, Figure 1]. The late time rebrightening implies that additional energy is injected in
the external shock months after the burst[14]. This may happen if, for instance, the jTDE is
accompanied by a powerful mildly relativistic component[18]2.

In this contribution we focus on the numerical and technical aspects of jTDE modeling. In
Section 2 we describe the numerical codes used in the calculations and how they depend on each
other. The Section 3 gives an overview of computational requirements and their consequences
on the kind of models that we were able to produce. The discussion and summary is given in
the Section 4.

2 Numerical codes

SwJ1644 is a distant object (its redsfhit is z = 0.354 [10]), and is thus too small to be resolved
in great detail3. Thus, the only direct observations that we have are the total ﬂuxes for diﬀerent
times and frequencies (i.e., multiwavelength light curves). Nevertheless, when simulating this
source we need to construct a detailed, resolved model of the SwJ1644 jet, simulate its dynamics,
compute its resolved emission, and only in the ﬁnal stage integrate the resolved emission to
compute the total ﬂux to be compared to observations.
In order to achieve this we use two
numerical codes so that the output of the ﬁrst code (MRGENESIS ) is used as an input to
the second one (SPEV ). The former simulates the jet dynamics, while the latter computes its
emission.

2.1 Relativistic hydrodynamics simulations

MRGENESIS is a code developed to solve the equations of relativistic numerical (magneto)
hydrodynamics in the laboratory frame (i.e., a frame at rest with respect to the distant source)4.
The code is massively parallelized using MPI5 and OpenMP6 librararies, and uses the parallel
HDF57 library for ﬁle input and output. We employ a method of lines for our simulations in
which the spatial reconstruction is a based on the third order PPM reconstruction routines[22],
and the time update is performed by means of a third order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme[23].
Numerical ﬂuxes are evaluated with the Marquina ﬂux formula[24]. We simulate SwJ1644 in
two dimensions assuming axisymmetry and discretize the computational domain using spherical
coordinates. The black hole is assumed to be located at the origin and the TDE occurs at scales
that are much smaller than the ones we consider in our work (we simulate neither the TDE nor
the jet launching). We set the beginning of the numerical grid at ∼ 1016 cm. The jet is injected

1Interested readers can ﬁnd details of the model based on the AGN jet-disc symbiosis in Section 2.1 of [17].
We note that [17] assume that the origin of the emission is internal to the jet, as opposed to the external emission
that we advocate.

2For an overview of alternative explanations for late-time rebrightening see Section 2.2 of [18].
3According to our numerical models we predict that SwJ1644 may become resolvable by Very Long Baseline

Inteferometry sometime in the next few years (see Figure 13 in [18]).

drodynamics in [20], and the current parallelized version (MRGENESIS ) that handles ultrarelativistic magnetized
outﬂows in [21].

through the inner boundary in an angular interval [0, θj], assuming a constant Lorentz factor Γj,
and a luminosity whose time dependence is Lj(t) = Lj,0 max[1, (t/t0)]−5/3. t0 is the time during
which the jet luminosity is constant, and the peak lumiosity Lj,0 is computed from the total
jTDE energy EISO through Lj,0 = 2EISO/(5t0). The jet interacts with a CNM that is assumed
to be at rest with a density proﬁle ρcnm = n18mp(r/1018cm)−k, where mp is the proton mass, n18
is the particle number density at 1018 cm and k is the power-law index of the density proﬁle. We
assume that initially both the jet and the external medium are cold. During the simulation we
periodically store the snapshots of the computational grid in order to obtain a suﬃcient coverage
of the jet-CNM interaction to be able to compute the resulting emission with suﬃcient precision
(see Section 3).

2.2 Radiative transfer

Once the relativistic hydrodynamics simulation has ﬁnished, the snapshots it produced are used
by the code SPEV to compute the emission. The spatial distribution of the hydrodynamics
variables needs to be stored with suﬃcient frequency because of the space-time transformations
that need to be performed to compute the observable radiation in the (distant) observer frame.
SPEV [25] is designed to process an arbitrary number of pre-computed sets of hydrodynamic
states of the ﬂuid (i.e., density, pressure, positions, velocities, magnetic ﬁeld) and to compute
the resulting non-thermal emission. The procedure can be summarized as follows:

1. Injection: SPEV uses a set of Lagrangian particles (LPs) as a representation of the
emitting volumes. Each LP has a deﬁned position, shape and velocity. Attached to it
there is a representation of the non-thermal electron (NTE) energy distribution. In SPEV,
new LPs are created each time a snapshot is processed. The position of the shock fronts
that form as a consequence of the jet-CNM interaction is detected, and LPs are injected
into the shocked ﬂuid immediately behind the front. Since the actual process of particle
acceleration occurs on temporal and spatial scales far below the ones we are able to simulate
(see e.g., [26] for a recent review), we use a phenomenological model to link the ﬂuid state
with NTE distribution. The model we use is a standard one [27]: the energy contained in
the NTEs and in the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld are assumed to be fractions ǫe and ǫB of
the shocked ﬂuid thermal energy. The injection spectrum is assumed to be a power-law
in energy n(γ) ∝ γ−p, where p is the power-law index and γ is the NTE Lorentz factor.
We determine the normalization and energy cutoﬀs of the distribution using a numerical
procedure described in detail in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of [28].

2. Transport, evolution and emission: As it processes the snapshots, SPEV transports
the injected LPs, assuming that after they have been injected they move with the ﬂuid.
An exception are the newly injected LPs: between the snapshot in which the particle is
injected and the subsequent one the two edges parallel to the shock front are assumed to
move with diﬀerent velocities (one with the velocity of the shocked ﬂuid and the other one
with the faster velocity of the shock front). This ensures that new LPs correctly represent
the increase in the volume due to newly shocked ﬂuid, regardless of the numerical resolu-
tion or the frequency with which snapshots are stored. Simultaneously, the NTE energy
losses due to synchrotron radiation, as well as the energy gains(losses) due to adiabatic
compression(expansion) are taken into account:

where t, ρ, uB and urad are the time, ﬂuid density, magnetic ﬁeld energy density and

describes an eﬃcient numerical algorithm for solving Eq. 1 for each NTE distribution in
each LP. At the same time that the particles are evolved, their non-thermal emission is
computed (see Section 4 of [25] for a description of an eﬃcient numerical algorithm for
computing synchrotron emission and absorption coeﬃcients, and Section A.2.1 of the same
paper for a description of the way particles in two-dimensional axisymmetric models can
be used to represent three-dimensional emitting volumes). The coeﬃcients computed in
this step are stored in a global array that is used in the ﬁnal step.

3. Solving the radiative transfer equation: After all the snapshots have been processed
and the emission from all LPs has been computed for all times, the time- and frequency-
dependent emission can be computed. We assume that there is a virtual screen (“virtual
detector”, VD) located in front of the source, and the goal is to compute the intensity in
each of the virtual pixels of the VD. This is done by solving the radiative transfer equation

dIν
ds

= jν − ανIν , ,

(2)

where Iν , jν and αν are the speciﬁc intensity, emissivity and absorption coeﬃcient. s is
the distance along the line of sight from the jet to a particular pixel and it relates the
simulation time t to the time of observation T by t = T + (D − s)/c, where D is the
distance from the VD to the source. In other words, for a given T and t, s is the distance
of a LP from which radiation is observed at time T if that LP is emitting at a time t. We
note that Eq. 2 needs to be solved in such a way that s is monotonously increasing from the
jet towards the VD. Therefore, after all the snapshots have been processed, the emission
and absorption coeﬃcients need to be sorted according to their s and then Eq. 2 is solved
for each pixel.

In practice the positions of LPs in steps (i) and (ii) are stored in a set of (large) intermediate ﬁles
(“preprocessor” ﬁles). A postprocessor executes the radiation part of step (ii) by reading the
preprocessor ﬁles and storing the coeﬃcients in memory. After all preprocessor ﬁles have been
postprocessed, the step (iii) is executed. Both preprocessor and postprocessor parts of SPEV
are paralellized using OpenMP. The postprocessor, in particular, needs to be run on a machine
with enough shared memory8 because all information produced in step 2 needs to be held in
memory for the step 3 to correctly compute the intensities.

3 Simulations of Swift J1644+57 jet

As mentioned in Section 2.1, we model SwJ1644 jet in two-dimensions. However, as will be
explained in this Section, the total cost in terms of computing time, disk storage and working
memory of each two-dimensional simulation is high. Therefore, we ﬁrst perform a number of
much less costly tests using a one-dimensional approximation to two-dimensional models. The
goal of those tests is to determine the values of a number of the parameters of the numerical
simulation for which the results are satisfactory. Afterward, the two-dimensional simulations are
performed using the values determined in one-dimensional tests.

3.1 One-dimensional tests

Using MRGENESIS we simulate one-dimensional spherically symmetric jets. For the purpose
of computing their emission with SPEV we assume that their opening angles are θj. We ﬁx all

agement in SPEV.

the physical parameters of the jet (EISO = 4 × 1054 erg, Γj = 10, θj = 0.1 rad, t0 = 5 × 105 s)
and of the external medium (n18 = 60 cm−3, k = 1.5). This corresponds to the inner relativistic
component of the two-component jet in [18]. The numerical parameters that will be varied are9:

• ∆Tsnap: time interval between snapshots (MRGENESIS )

• ∆r: radial resolution (MRGENESIS )

• ∆θ: angular resolution (MRGENESIS 10)

• Nb: number of NTE energy distribution bins (SPEV )

• nx: resolution of the virtual detector (SPEV 11)

We choose as a default set of parameters ∆Tsnap = 8.3×104 s, ∆r = 5×1013 cm, ∆θ = 2×10−3
rad, Nb = 32, nx = 1000. We follow the jet evolution until ∼ 6.7 × 108 seconds. During the
ﬁrst 1.3 × 108 seconds the snapshots are output every ∆Tsnap, and afterward the time interval
increases by a factor 1.002 after every snapshot is output.

Fig. 3.1 shows the light curves for the default model evaluated at 1.4 GHz (red line) and
the consequence of variations in the resolution of the hydrodynamic models, i.e., as a result of
changing ∆r. As can be seen, relatively small diﬀerences of the order of a percent are visible
at early times and after the light curve maximum. The top right panel in Fig. 3.1 shows the
result of changing angular resolution. Here the diﬀerences are somewhat larger, especially when
comparing the lowest and highest resolution (∼ 4% at peak). The middle left panel in Fig. 3.1
shows how the results depend on the number of bins in which NTE energy distribution of each
LP is discretized. We see that the convergence is only achieved for Nb >
∼ 32. In the middle right
panel we can see that the oscillations at early times are due to poor VD resolution. The angular
size of the jet is very small at those times and it is only properly resolved for nx ∼ 104 for a
linear pixel distribution (covering the interval [0, 5 × 1018 cm]), and nx ∼ 103 for a logarithmic
one (covering the interval [1012 cm, 5 × 1018 cm]). In the next section we will explain how we
solved the problem of noise for 2D simulation light curves, especially the oﬀ-axis ones where it
is not feasible to distribute the VD pixels logarithmically. Finally, the bottom left panel shows
the (weak) dependence on ∆Tsnap.

3.2 Two-dimensional simulations

In the previous section we showed how the light curves change as the ﬁve principal numerical
parameters are changed. Most importantly for the 2D simulations, with the previous tests we
have already obtained a very good proxy for the largest values of ∆r and ∆θ we can use in
order to reduce the computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results. In
the ﬁnal simulations showed in [18] we used ∆r = 4 × 1014 cm and ∆θ ≃ 2.6 × 10−3 rad. In this
section we discuss the technical challenges of computing the emission even from these relatively
low-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

The complete two-dimensional evolution is stored in 2412 snapshots. It was fortunate that
HDF5 format permits data compression so that the compressed snapshots occupy ≃ 460 Gbytes.

9We note that the results of a limited number of numerical tests have also been presented in Appendix A of

[18], but here we perform an exhaustive analaysis.

10When performing one-dimensional simulations we create mock two-dimensional snapshots using ∆θ as angular

cell size.

11In these one-dimensional tests we assume that the jet is observed on-axis (viewing angle is 0 degrees), so
that its emission is axially-symmetric and we only need to compute the emission along VD x-axis. For oﬀ-axis
observations a (much more costly) two-dimensional VD calculation is performed [18, Section 5.2]. We comment
in detail on technical challenges of 2D simulations in next section.

Running the preprocessor with the default parameters of Section 3.1 produces 160 (compressed)
intermediate ﬁles. Each of the ﬁrst 159 ﬁles contains the positions, geometry, velocity, magnetic
ﬁeld and the 32 bins of the NT energy distibution of 2.5×106 LPs, while the last ﬁle only contains
≃ 1.9 × 106 LPs. This means that in total there are ≃ 4 × 108 two-dimensional emitting LPs in
step (ii) of the SPEV algorithm (see Section 2.2). Since each of the LPs has to be converted to a
three-dimensional emitting volume, it may contribute to multiple VD pixels and also to multiple
observing times, we soon realized that the realistic upper limit of <
∼1 TByte of RAM on our
shared memory machine12 would not be enough to compute oﬀ-axis images at full resolution.
A remedy to this problem was to artiﬁcially reduce the angular resolution when preprocessing
the hydrodynamic snapshots by a factor of 2 or 4 (this would roughly correspond going from
the second-best to third- of fourth-best angular resolution in top left panel in Figure 3.1.). This
reduces the number of emitting volumes so that even oﬀ-axis radiative transfer calculations could
be performed.

3.2.1 On-axis light curves

For the purposes of the numerical tests we computed the on-axis light curves (in complete analogy
to the tests presented in Section 3.1). Bottom right panel in Figure 3.1 shows on-axis light curves
using the full angular resolution, as well as the result of degrading it by factors of 2 and 4.

In Figure 2 we show a subset of the data that SPEV stores when postprocessing the interme-
diate ﬁles. In this particular case we show all the contributions to the emission at T = 1.4 × 106
seconds and at 15.4 GHz. The data shown originates from LPs emitting at diﬀerent times from
diﬀerent positions (the lower the value of y the earlier the LP had to emit for it to be observed at
1.4 × 106 seconds). In other words, what is shown does not correspond to one particular snapshot
of the jet evolution. Nevertheless, we know that the edge of the emitting region corresponds to
the position of the bow shock of the jet. We also see in the bottom right panel in Figure 2 that
a small region behind the shock is optically thin and most of the contribution to the emission
comes from this region and from the surface at which the emission becomes optically thin (the
transition between light and dark blue regions). Using this type of analysis it is possible to
understand, among other things, why the inverse Compton cooling of the electrons is not very
eﬃcient at low frequencies (though it may be important for higher frequency observations of
SwJ1644, see [30]): the electrons cool after being accelerated by the shock, but since they are
advected behind it, once they enter the opaque region (dark blue), they stop contributing to the
observed emission. Therefore the observer does not see a large eﬀect of the inverse Compton
cooling [18, Section 4.1.2].

3.2.2 Oﬀ-axis light curves

Here we comment on the procedure we use to reduce the numerical noise that shows at early
times (Figure 3.1). As was commented in Section 3.1, the jet is small at early times, so that at a
typical resolution of 1000 points per spatial direction it is very poorly resolved by the VD. Due
to memory limitations we were not able to use VD resolution of 100002. However, the resolutions
of 10002 pixels were feasible. Therefore, we adopted the following procedure:

1. Pre-determine the jet viewing angle θobs and the times Ti (i = 1, .. nt) at which it is to be

observed.

2. Compute the radio images using 1000 × 1000 VD for each Ti in a single calculation.

12We use the machine LluisVives hosted at

It has 30 Xeon 7500
hexacore CPUs clocked at 2.67 GHz and almost 1 TBytes of RAM. For more information see

the part of the emitting volume that is transparent, while the emission in the dark blue region

stored in the global array used by SPEV to compute the intensity in each pixel (see Section 2.2).
The luminosity is obtained by integrating the intensity along vertical lines in the top right panel
(taking into account that the emission is axially symmetric).

3. For each Ti, determine the rectangle that contains 99.99% of the emission. Then expand

the rectangle by a safety margin.

4. For each Ti, independently re-compute the radio image by limiting the VD to the rectangle

computed in the previous step, but using the resolution 1000 × 1000.

The above procedure enables us to compute the emission from early times without numerical
artifacts13. The tradeoﬀ is that we need to postprocess the intermediate ﬁles multiple times: once
in step (ii) and then additional nt times in step (iv). The computing time does not necessarily
scale as nt since, for each Ti, the emission and absorption coeﬃcients are only computed from
those emitting volumes that contribute to the emission, while the rest (typically corresponding to
most of the volume of the model) are ignored. This is made eﬃcient by indexing the intermediate
ﬁles. For a given observing angle the calculations at 8 diﬀerent observing frequencies last ≃ 3 − 5
days.

4 Summary

In this contribution we have discussed the technical details of the one and two dimensional sim-
ulations of the SwJ1644 jet. In Section 2 we explain in detail how the relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations are coupled to the radiative transfer code to produce the synthetic observations (light
curves) that can be directly compared to the observations. In Section 3.1 we show that many
one-dimensional tests can be used to probe the sensitivity of the computed light curves on the
resolution of the hydrodynamic simulations, on the frequency of stored snapshots, on the resolu-
tion of the discretization in energy space and of the virtual detector. The results obtained helped
to determine the resolution of the two dimensional simulation so that its computational cost is
acceptable, but also so that the ﬁnal light curves are as free of numerical artifacts as possible.
This procedure has been successful in enabling us to produce a viable two-component jet model
of the SwJ1644 jet.

13Figures 12-14 in [18] were computed using this procedure. Note that in Figure 14 in [18] the jet size in the
