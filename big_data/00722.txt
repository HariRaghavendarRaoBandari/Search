Abstract

We evaluate two integrals over x ∈ [0, 1] involving products of the function ζ1(a, x) ≡
ζ(a, x) − x−a for ℜ(a) > 1, where ζ(a, x) is the Hurwitz zeta function. The evaluation of
these integrals for the particular case of integer a ≥ 2 is also presented. As an application
we calculate the O(g) weak-coupling expansion coeﬃcient c1(ε) of the Casimir energy for
a ﬁlm with Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions, ﬁrst stated by Symanzik [Schr¨odinger
representation and Casimir eﬀect in renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theory, Nucl. Phys. B 190
(1981) 1-44] in the framework of gφ4

Introduction

The Hurwitz zeta function ζ(a, x), see (1.1), is one of the most fundamental functions in math-
ematics. It has important applications, for example, in number theory [1, 2], probability theory
[3] and in the evaluation of mathematical constants [4]. This function also ﬁnds application in nu-
merous areas of mathematical physics. Examples are in the evaluation of functional determinants
and in gases of free electrons in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, calculations of the Casimir eﬀect
[5] in quantum ﬁeld theory and its analogues in statistical physics and thermal ﬁeld theory at high
temperatures; see e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9] for extensive lists of physical examples.

The Hurwitz zeta function is deﬁned by the series [10, p. 89], [11, Ch. 13]

(1.1)

and elsewhere by analytic continuation, apart from a = 1, where it has a simple pole with unit
residue (see (1.5) below).
In its convergence domain, the series (1.1) converges absolutely and
uniformly. The function ζ(a, x) reduces to the Riemann zeta function when x = 1, viz.

ζ(a, 1) = ζ(a) =

and as x → 0+, its behavior is singular described by ζ(a, x) ∼ x−a.

The relation (1.3) can be regarded as a Taylor expansion of the function on the left-hand side
in powers of z and will be used below in the special cases b = 1 and b = 2. At a = 1, which
is forbidden in (1.3), the poles of the Hurwitz functions cancel on both sides due to the Laurent
expansion

This transforms the formula (1.3) to

ζ(1 + ǫ, z) =

Integrals of Hurwitz zeta functions with respect to the variable x have been discussed by several

authors [14, 12, 15, 16]. In [15]1 (see also [17]), the Hurwitz transform

was considered for a variety of functions f (x), including integer powers of x, trigonometric, expo-
0 |ζ1(a, x)|2dx was
initiated. This problem has been considered further in [18, 19, 20, 21] and papers cited therein, in
a number-theoretic context when a = 1
2 + it and t → ±∞. In this last integral, the auxiliary zeta
function ζ1(a, x) appears, obtained by splitting the singular zeroth term from ζ(a, x):

is (cf. (1.1)) that it is continuous in the whole interval x ∈ [0, 1]. Note that ζ1(a, 0) = ζ(a). It
is easy to deduce from the Wilton formula (1.3) an analogous Taylor expansion for ζ1(a, b − z) by
using its deﬁnition in (1.7) and employing the binomial expansion in the term (b − z)−a. In the
special case of b = 1, to be considered below, this reads

Note that the last formula has a well-deﬁned limit as z → 1 with the left-hand side reducing to
ζ(a), whereas both sides of (1.3) diverge at z = b.

for ℜ(a, b) > 1. The ﬁrst integral has been given in [18, Eq. (5)]2 and [20, Corollary 4]; here we
give a diﬀerent derivation. Both evaluations of the above integrals present apparent singularities
at integer values of a, b ≥ 2 and require a limiting procedure to determine their values for these
special values of the parameters.
As an application of the above two integrals, we give a derivation of the Casimir amplitude
resulting from the attraction of two inﬁnite parallel planes with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
This result was stated without proof in [22, p. 12] and has been derived subsequently by other
means in [23].

Finally, we note that integrals of the same form have been calculated very recently in [24].
They involve a “deformation” of the Hurwitz zeta function ζE(a, x) that contains the extra factor
(−1)k in its deﬁnition given by (1.1). Its relation to the usual ζ(a, x) is [24, Eq. (1.6)]

2. The integral of a product of auxiliary Hurwitz zeta functions

We ﬁrst consider the integral

I(a, b) := Z 1

0

ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, x) dx,

(2.1)

where the parameters a and b satisfy ℜ(a, b) > 1. This region comes from the condition that the
simple series deﬁnition (1.8) of the functions ζ1(a, x) and ζ1(b, x) exists, and there is no additional
constraint due to the convergence of the integral in (2.1). The integrand is a smooth integrable
function everywhere in the integration region [0, 1]. This integral has been evaluated in [18, Eq. (5)]
(see footnote 2) and [20, Corollary 4] with a, b 6= 2, 3 . . . . The main motivation for taking diﬀerent
parameters a and b in the integrand of (2.1) has been in evaluation of the “mean-square” of the
Hurwitz zeta function, when a and b are complex conjugate numbers, especially, a = b∗ = 1
2 + it
(see [14, 18, 19, 20, 21]).
In view of the importance of this problem and for completeness in
presentation, we give here a diﬀerent method of proof.

As in [20] (cf. [20, Eq. (3.1)]), we start by using Atkinson’s dissection [25] to split the double

summation in ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, x) = Pk,n≥1(·) into parts with k = n, k < n, and k > n, which yields

ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, x) = ζ1(a + b, x) +

−1/(1 − z − w).

(ℜ(a + b) > 1).

(2.3)

The second and third terms of (2.2) are similar and so it suﬃces to present the details of only
one of these terms. Choosing to evaluate the third term, we can use the integral representation
(1.10) for the function ζ1 and the Laplace integral

and noting that the factors 1 − e−(t+y) cancel3 in the product of these two results, we can write

Γ(1 − a, t) = Γ(1 − a) − γ(1 − a, t)

where γ(a, x) denotes the lower incomplete gamma function. Performing the integral over t in (2.4)
related to the ﬁrst term of this last equation, we obtain by (1.10)

S = B(a + b − 1, 1 − a) ζ(a + b − 1) −

where B(x, y) is the beta function

(2.5)

3It is actually this cancellation that allowed us to easily ﬁnish the calculation. There has been no such cancellation
in our attempts to calculate the integral J(a, b), considered in the next section, by employing Atkinson’s dissection
in the product ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, 1 − x) in its integrand. For this reason we had to resort to alternative means in the
evaluation of J(a, b) in Section 3.

In the remaining integral over t we use the series expansion [26, Eq. (8.5.1)]

(1 − a)n+1
where again (a)k is the Pochhammer symbol (see (1.4)). So,

(2.6)

Though derived for ℜ(a, b) > 1, this result provides the analytic continuation of I(a, b) into the
whole complex a, b planes except at a = 1 and b = 1 since both sides of (2.6) are analytic functions
of a and b, apart from a = 1, b = 1 where there is a double pole.

Remark 1. The second term in (2.6) coincides with the similar Mikol´as integral of the product of
Hurwitz zeta functions (cf. [20, Eq. (6.4)], [18, Eq. (2)], [15, Eq. (3.2)])

The expression on the right-hand side of (2.6) presents apparent singularities when a, b = 2, 3, . . .
due to the presence of the factors Γ(1 − a), (1 − a)n+1 and Γ(1 − b), (1 − b)n+1 in the last three
terms. However, when a = b these singularities cancel to leave a regular function. The value
of I(a, b) when a = b = m at integer values of m ≥ 2 is obtained by a limiting process and is
considered in the appendix; see also [27]. This yields

Theorem 2. For integer m = 2, 3, . . . , we have the evaluation

It is readily shown that this result is equivalent to that obtained in [27, Theorem 3].

3. The integral of a product of auxiliary Hurwitz zeta functions with

complementary arguments

The second integral we consider is

J(a, b) := Z 1

0

ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, 1 − x) dx

(a, b 6= 1).

(3.1)

As in the case of I(a, b) in (2.1), the integrand in J(a, b) is regular in the whole integration range
x ∈ [0, 1] and the integral converges for any allowed values of a and b. Following the approach
of Andersson [18], we ﬁrst evaluate the integral (3.1) for 0 < ℜ(a, b) < 1 and then extend it into
ℜ(a, b) > 1 by analytic continuation. The result we obtain again presents apparent singularities at
a, b = 2, 3, . . . ; the value of J(a, b) in the special case a = b for integer values of a is derived by a
limiting process similar to that in the appendix.

3.1 Evaluation of J(a, b)

In a similar manner to that employed in [18], we rewrite the integral J(a, b) as follows:

J(a, b) = Z 1
= Z 1

0

0 (cid:2)ζ(a, x) − x−a(cid:3)(cid:2)ζ(b, 1 − x) − (1 − x)−b(cid:3) dx

0 {x−aζ1(b, 1 − x) + x−bζ1(a, 1 − x)} dx

−Z 1

0

x−a(1 − x)−b dx.

(3.2)

An explicit expression for the ﬁrst integral on the right-hand side of (3.2) can be obtained from
the result derived in [15, Eq. (3.4)] given by

Z 1

0

ζ(a, x)ζ(b, 1 − x) dx = B(1 − a, 1 − b)ζ(a + b − 1)

(3.3)

for the region ℜ(a) ≤ 0, ℜ(b) ≤ 0, where B(x, y) is the beta function deﬁned in (2.5). The right-
hand side of (3.3) can be extended to the domain ℜ(a) < 1, ℜ(b) < 1 by analytic continuation;
hence (3.3) is valid for ℜ(a) < 1 and ℜ(b) < 1.
To calculate the second integral in (3.2) we use the Taylor expansion (1.9) and perform a
term-by-term integration. This gives (with 0 < ℜ(a, b) < 1)

A similar result holds for the third integral in (3.2) with a and b interchanged.

Finally, evaluation of the last integral on the right-hand side of (3.2) as B(1 − a, 1 − b) (when

0 < ℜ(a, b) < 1) then yields the result:
Theorem 3. When 0 < ℜ(a, b) < 1, we have the evaluation

Although calculated for 0 < ℜ(a, b) < 1, this result provides the analytic continuation of J(a, b)
into ℜ(a, b) > 1 since both sides of (3.5) are analytic functions of a and b, except at a = 1, b = 1
where there is a double pole.

Zeta function integrals

Again, the expression on the right-hand side of (3.5) presents apparent singularities at a, b =
2, 3, . . ., but these will be shown to cancel when b = a to leave a regular function of a when
ℜ(a) > 1.

3.2 Evaluation of J(a, a) for integer a ≥ 2
We consider the special case of J(a, b) deﬁned in (3.1) when a = b. We let a = m + ǫ, where
m = 2, 3, . . . , and consider the limit ǫ → 0. Using the deﬁnition of the beta function (2.5), we ﬁnd
from (3.5)

J(m, m) = lim

Γ2(1 − m − ǫ)
Γ(1 − s − 2ǫ) {ζ(s + 2ǫ) − 1} +

2Γ(s + ǫ)

ǫ Γ(m)Γ(m + ǫ) {ζ(s + ǫ) − 1}.

In writing D(m+ǫ) in the above form we have used the deﬁnition (1.4) for the Pochhammer symbol
(m + ǫ)m−1 appearing in the n = (m − 1)th term of the sum in (3.7) and temporarily introduced
the shorthand s := 2m − 1 ≥ 3.
When expanding D(m + ǫ) for ǫ ≪ 1, we use the well-known small-parameter expansions of the
Euler gamma function
(3.9)

Γ(z + ǫ) = Γ(z){1 + ǫψ(z) + O(ǫ2)}

where ψ(z) denotes again the psi-function, and, in particular,

Γ(−p + α) =

(−)p
p! α {1 + αψ(p + 1) + O(α2)}

(3.10)

if p is a non-negative integer. We need these two formulas with z = s, z = m, and p = s − 1,
p = m − 1, respectively. By a straightforward calculation we see immediately that the pole
contributions

of the two terms in D(m + ǫ) mutually cancel, and we are left with their ﬁnite parts which combine

2Γ(s)

Γ2(m)(cid:26){ψ(s) − ψ(m)} {ζ(s) − 1} + ζ ′(s) + O(ǫ)(cid:27).

Hence we obtain, by recalling (3.8) and s = 2m − 1,
Theorem 4. For m = 2, 3, . . . , we have the evaluation

4. An application: The Casimir amplitude up to O(g) in the gφ4 ﬁeld theory

In 1981, Symanzik [22] proved the ﬁniteness of the Casimir energy4 E(g, L, µ, ε) of a pair of
parallel plates with Dirichlet boundary conditions to all orders in the perturbation expansion of
the massless gµεφ4
d theory. He considered the (super) renormalizable Euclidean scalar φ4 ﬁeld
theory with the dimensionless coupling constant g in d = 4 − ε space dimensions for ε ∈ [0, 1).
The d − 1 dimensional parallel boundary plates are separated by the distance L. An arbitrary
momentum scale µ of dimension [length]−1 is introduced into the theory; it combines, for example,
with the slab thickness L to form the dimensionless combination µL. The position vector in the
slab x = (r, z) consists of two components: the vector r ∈ Rd−1 is parallel to the boundary planes,
whereas z ∈ [0, L] is the one-dimensional coordinate running in the direction perpendicular to
them.

The Casimir energy density has been given in [22, Eq. (4.5b)] as an inﬁnite series

E(g, L, µ, ε)/A = L−(d−1)hc0(ε) + c1(ε)¯g(g, µL, ε) + O(¯g2)i

(4.1)

in powers of the running coupling constant ¯g = ¯g(g, µL, ε) with computable coeﬃcients cn(ε),
where A is the area of the boundary planes. The coeﬃcient c0(ε) corresponds to the one-loop
. The value of c0(ε)
contribution of the perturbation theory given by the Feynman diagram
can be found in [22, Eq. (4.4)],

along with a sketch of its derivation. Its expansion up to the ﬁrst order in ε is

The coeﬃcient c1(ε) comes from the two-loop, O(g) Feynman diagram

(4.3)

To explain the functions appearing in the integrand it is useful to start with the free-ﬁeld propagator
(Green function) of the massless φ4
d theory in the inﬁnite d dimensional space, Gb(x). It is given
by

Gb(x) = Cx−2+ε

with

C = 1

4 π−2+ε/2Γ(1 − 1

2 ε),

where x is the distance between any two points in Rd. Its (inﬁnite) value at x = 0 is subtracted
from each term of (4.3). Further, the GD(r; z1, z2) is the Dirichlet propagator in the semi-inﬁnite
space conﬁned by a single boundary plane. It is given by

GD(r; z1, z2) = Gb (r;|z1 − z2|) − Gb (r; z1 + z2) ,

4This is a counterpart of the interaction energy between two parallel conducting plates due to zero-point energy
ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld calculated by Casimir in 1948 [5]. For more extended information and
various applications the interested reader may be referred to, for example, [6, 8, 28].

where r = |r1− r2| is the “parallel” distance between the points x1 and x2. Its explicit expression,
though in somewhat diﬀerent notation, is given in [22, Eq. (2.13)]. Finally, the Dirichlet-Dirichlet
Green function in the ﬁlm geometry described at the beginning of the present section is given by
(compare with the previous formula)

GL

D(r; z1, z2) =

∞

Xn=−∞hGb (r;|z1 − z2 + 2Ln|) − Gb (r; z1 + z2 + 2Ln)i .

Again, the “expanded” version of this formula can be found in [22, Eq. (4.7)].

For coincident points x1 and x2 inside the slab, which is needed to construct the O(g) graph

, we have for the combination in the ﬁrst square brackets in (4.3) [22, Eq. (4.8)]

GL
D(0; z, z) − Gb(0) = C (2L)−2+ε [2ζ(2 − ε) − ζ(2 − ε, z/L) − ζ(2 − ε, 1 − z/L)] ,

where the functions ζ(a, x) are the Hurwitz zeta functions deﬁned in (1.1). Finally, for the second
square brackets in (4.3) we have

GD(0; z, z) − Gb(0) = −Gb(2z) = −C(2z)−2+ε

along with a similar expression inside the third brackets.

After giving all these prerequisites for the calculation, Symanzik [22, p. 12] just gave the
ﬁnal result (quoted in (4.11) below) for c1(ε) without referring to any details of the calculation.
However, we ﬁnd these details essential and consequently re-derive his result by using just the
above formulas given in purely coordinate representation.5

To proceed, we express the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (4.3) as

where the related Feynman integrals I0,L and IL,∞ are labeled with respect to their integration
ranges over z. These are given by

(α ∈ (1, 2])

(4.7)

with x = z/L.

For convenience we have introduced the notation α ≡ 2− ε. This will facilitate the comparison
with expressions of the preceding sections. Note that for 0 ≤ ε < 1, which we consider here,
1 < α ≤ 2. The endpoint α = 2 of the interval α ∈ (1, 2] corresponds to the marginal value ε = 0.
Keeping it nonnegative means that we do not move in dimensions d > 4 where the underlying φ4
d
theory becomes non-renormalizable. On the other hand, with the constraint α > 1 all Hurwitz
and Riemann zeta functions appearing in the present section are well deﬁned in the classical sense
of (1.1)–(1.8).

By construction, the improper integral K(α) is convergent and well deﬁned (at least) in the
whole region of the parameter α indicated in its deﬁnition (4.7), with smooth behavior in the limit
α → 2. The ﬁnite value of K(α) at α = 2 directly contributes to the value of the coeﬃcient c1(ε)
at ε = 0 given between (4.8) and (4.9) in [22].

5Ten years after the paper by Symanzik [22], Krech and Dietrich [23] reproduced the coeﬃcient c1(ε) by using

the momentum representation along with dimensional and zeta regularizations.

Zeta function integrals

The calculation of the integral K(α) deﬁned by (4.7) is the main nontrivial task of the present
section. In its integrand, we express each Hurwitz zeta function ζ(α, y) in terms of the auxiliary
function ζ1(α, y) with y 7→ x and y 7→ 1 − x. Thus, some straightforward algebra leads us to

K(α) = −4ζ2(α) + 2I(α) + 2J(α) + 2M (α),

(4.8)

where the integrals I(α) and J(α) are those from (2.1) and (3.1) respectively, and

M (α) = Z 1
0 n(cid:2)x−α + (1 − x)−α − 2ζ(α)(cid:3) [ζ1(α, x) + ζ1(α, 1 − x) − 2ζ(α)] + x−α(1 − x)−αodx .
(4.9)
Note that the integral M (α) is completely symmetric with respect to the transformation x ↔ 1−x.
From the fact that

ζ1(α, x) = ζ(α) − αxζ(α + 1) + O(x2),

ζ1(α, 1 − x) = ζ(α) − 1 + αx [ζ(α + 1) − 1] + O(x2),

it follows that the integrand of M is O(x2−α) + O(1) as x → 0. By symmetry under the trans-
formation x 7→ 1 − x the behavior of the integrand is O((1 − x)2−α) + O(1) as x → 1. Hence the
integral M (α) converges for 1 < α ≤ 2.

Substitution of all explicit evaluations into (4.8) and (4.9) then yields

K(α) = 4ζ2(α) + 2ζ(2α − 1)(cid:26)2B(1 − α, 2α − 1) + B(1 − α, 1 − α)(cid:27) +

2

2α − 1

.

(4.10)

Combining (4.3)–(4.6), (4.5), and (4.10) we obtain, after some straightforward algebra, the ﬁrst-
order contribution to the Casimir energy (4.1)

g(µL)εL−3+εc1(ε) = (cid:8)2−9+2επ−4+εΓ2(1 − ε/2)g(µL)εL−3+ε(cid:9)×

The numerical coeﬃcient of this last equation with α = 2− ε then yields the coeﬃcient c1(ε) given
by

×(cid:8)ζ2(α) + (1 − cos πα)B(1 − α, 2α − 1)ζ(2α − 1)(cid:9) .

for ε ∈ [0, 1), as stated in [22, p. 12].
As we mentioned before, this result has been obtained by other means in [23, Eq. (5.11)], in
the context of statistical physics. There, the constant c1(0) = 2−11/9, see [22, p. 12], enters the
O(ε) term of the ε expansion of the Casimir amplitude for a Dirichlet ﬁlm in the n component

Further ε expansion terms of c1(ε) would contribute to O(ε2) and higher order terms that follow
in (4.12). Further generalizations and extensions of this approach can be found in [6, 29, 30].

5. Concluding remarks

In the present article we have studied the long-standing mathematical problem of calculating the
deﬁnite integrals of products of two Hurwitz zeta functions, ζ1(a, x)ζ1(b, y) with a, b ∈ C and
y = {x, 1 − x} ∈ [0, 1]. The problem statement goes back to the classical work of Koksma and
Lekkerkerker [14], where it was formulated as a mean-value theorem for ζ1(s, x) with s = σ + it
and with special emphasis on the behavior of the integral R 1
0 |ζ1(s, x)|2dx in the asymptotic limit

Zeta function integrals

11

t → ±∞ when σ = 1
2 . In our notation, this problem statement would correspond to the choice
of two complex conjugate parameters a = b∗. An illuminating survey of this problem and its
numerous generalizations can be found in [31].

On the other hand, we noticed a close connection of the above mathematical problem with a
possible way [22] of calculating the Feynman integrals in Euclidean φ4 ﬁeld theories considered in
the space between two parallel planes. Here we considered the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions
imposed on boundary planes, though systems with some other boundary conditions [23, 6] could
be treated in a similar manner. In this context, the case of equal parameters a = b in the zeta
functions ζ1 is of relevance. We recall that the results derived in Section 4 have been recorded
by Symanzik in [22] without proof and the details of his calculation are not known. These results
were reproduced by Krech and Dietrich in [23] in a diﬀerent and much less involved way using
the momentum representation of the same Feynman integrals. To the best of our knowledge, our
derivation of (4.11) in terms of integrals of Hurwitz zeta functions is the ﬁrst derivation of this
formula carried out in this manner.

In doing this, we derived the known result for I(a, b) in a way that apparently has not been
employed by mathematicians for this integral. Also we needed an analogous result for J(a, b),
which has been considered to a lesser extent in the mathematical literature. Both these integrals
were necessary to reconstruct the coeﬃcient c1(ε) from [22, p. 12] in the main result (4.11) of
Section 4. Our motivation for the calculations of Section 4 was to give a computational scheme
for treating more complicated integrals of the same structure, where the functions in the integrand
would be essentially more complicated but have the same analytical properties. Such Feynman
integrals are needed in an eventual calculation of the next-to-leading, two-loop contribution to
the Casimir amplitude for strongly anisotropic critical systems in a ﬁlm geometry with Dirichlet-
Dirichlet boundary conditions. The corresponding one-loop term has been calculated in [30, Sec.
5.3.2].

Finally, we mention that our non-trivial calculations of the integrals considered in this paper

at integer a = b := m ≥ 2 ∈ N appear to be of both academic and practical interest.

Appendix: Evaluation of I(a, a) for integer a ≥ 2

We write (2.6) when a = b in the form

I(a, a) =

1

2a − 1 − 2

Γ(1 − a)
Γ(a) nS(a) − Γ(2a − 1)ζ(2a − 1)o,

(A.1)

where

S(a) =

∞

Xn=0

Γ(n + a)

Γ(n + 2 − a) {ζ(a + n) − 1}

and the common factor −2Γ(1 − a)/Γ(a) has been extracted from the expression in braces. Use
of the well-known result Γ(n + α)/Γ(n + β) ∼ nα−β (n → ∞) shows that the sum S(a) converges
absolutely since the terms are controlled by n2a−22−n as n → ∞.
Considering the sum S(a) for integer a = m ≥ 2, we observe that the function Γ(n + 2 − m)
in the denominator of S(m) has non-positive integer arguments n + 2 − m ≤ 0 and so becomes
singular when n ≤ m − 2. This means that the corresponding part of the sum S(m) vanishes,
and the non-vanishing contributions to S(m) come from the terms with n ≥ m − 1. Thus, upon

application of (1.2) we have

S(m) =

Xn=m−1

Γ(n + m)

Γ(n + 2 − m) {ζ(m + n) − 1} = Γ(2m − 1)

∞

Xk=0

(2m − 1)k

k!

ζ(2m − 1 + k, 2) .

Hence, by (1.3) with a 7→ 2m − 1, b = 2 and z = 1 we ﬁnd

S(m) = Γ(2m − 1)ζ(2m − 1).

(A.2)

Thus, the diﬀerence of terms in braces in (A.1) vanishes and the right-hand side of (A.1) is conse-
quently regular at integer a = m ≥ 2.
We now set a = m + ǫ, where m = 2, 3, . . . , in S(a) and consider the limit ǫ → 0 using the
small-parameter expansions (3.9) and (3.10). At the moment we have α = −ǫ in (3.10) and take
only its pole part into account. By writing S(a) as

S(m + ǫ) =

m−2

Xn=0

Γ(n + m + ǫ)

Γ(−p − ǫ) {ζ(n + m + ǫ) − 1} +

∞

Xn=m−1

Γ(n + m + ǫ)

Γ(q − ǫ)

{ζ(n + m + ǫ) − 1}

with p := m − n − 2 ≥ 0 and q := n + 2 − m ≥ 1 and expanding to ﬁrst order in ǫ, we ﬁnd

m−2

S(a) = S(m) − ǫ

Xn=0

(−)m−n(n + m − 1)! (m − n − 2)!{ζ(n + m) − 1}

+ ǫ

(n − m + 1)!

Υn(m) + O(ǫ2),

where we have deﬁned

Υn(m) := {ψ(n + m) + ψ(n + 2 − m)}{ζ(n + m) − 1} + ζ ′(n + m).

(A.3)

Similarly, for the last term from (A.1) we have by (A.2)

Γ(2a − 1)ζ(2a − 1) = S(m) + 2ǫΓ(2m − 1)(cid:26)ψ(2m − 1)ζ(2m − 1) + ζ ′(2m − 1)(cid:27) + O(ǫ2).

Finally, upon noting that the factor in braces in (A.1) is

Γ(1 − a)

Γ(a)

=

(−)m
ǫ Γ2(m){1 + O(ǫ)},

we then arrive at

I(m, m) =

(A.4)

where Z(m) := ψ(2m − 1)ζ(2m − 1) + ζ ′(2m − 1).
If we diﬀerentiate the well-known result obtained from (1.2) with b = 2, z = 1

The inﬁnite sum in (A.4) can be simpliﬁed by removing the term ζ ′(n+m) contained in Υn(m).

with respect to α, we ﬁnd that

ζ ′(α + k) = Γ(α)ψ(α)ζ(α) −

Then, the contribution from the part of the sum containing ζ ′(n + m) in (A.4) is

(n − m + 1)!

ζ ′(n + m)

(n + m − 1)!
(n − m + 1)!

ψ(n + m){ζ(n + m) − 1}.

Upon substitution of this evaluation in (A.4) we arrive at the result stated in (2.7) in Theorem 2.
