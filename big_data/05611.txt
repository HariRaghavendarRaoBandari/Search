PACS 67.85.Lm – Degenerate Fermi gases

Abstract – Dynamical properties of a few ultra-cold fermions conﬁned in a double-well poten-
tial is studied. We show that the dynamics, which is governed by single-particle tunnelings for
vanishing interactions, is completely diﬀerent for strong interactions. Depending on the details of
the conﬁguration, for suﬃciently strong interactions (repulsions or attractions) the particle ﬂow
through the barrier can be accelerated or slowed down. This eﬀect cannot be explained with
the single-particle picture. It is clariﬁed with direct inspection to the spectrum of the few-body
Hamiltonian.

Introduction. – Due to the remarkable progress in
controlling and engineering systems of ultra-cold gases,
the famous concept of the quantum simulator proposed
by Feynman over 30 years ago [1] is undergoing amaz-
ing renaissance. Many old-fashioned toy-models known
from classical textbooks on quantum theory are realized in
nowadays experiments and their properties can be probed
with very high accuracy [2]. The famous work-horses of
statistical and condensed matter physics like Ising, Heisen-
berg, or Hubbard models, together with plethora of their
variations, are currently accessible in many laboratories
in many diﬀerent conﬁgurations [3, 4]. These experimen-
tal possibilities oﬀer us a direct insight to the structure of
strongly-correlated states of the system not only in statical
but also in dynamical situations. One of the prominent ex-
amples is the in situ observation of the system undergoing
the quantum phase transition [5–7].

Completely new brand of experiments are performed in
the Johim Selim’s group, where ultra-cold mixtures of a
few fermions loaded in an eﬀective one-dimensional trap
are realized [8,9]. The shape of trapping potential together
with the strength of the interaction between particles of
diﬀerent spins can be tuned dynamically and occupations
of the single-particle levels can be measured. This tech-
nique enables one to observe the formation of the Fermi sea
when consecutive particles are added to the system one by
one [9]. In other experiments the fermionization of distin-
guishable particles [10–12] as well as pairing for attractive
forces [13–16] were observed. Recently, many theoretical

results on a few ultra-cold fermions in harmonic conﬁne-
ment were also reported [17–25] and they are awaiting
experimental veriﬁcation.

In the most recent experiment [26] a full control of two
fermions in a double-well potential was achieved. This
achievement, in the light of double-well experiments with
many fermions or bosons [27–34], have opened new pos-
sibility of studying the celebrated Josephson eﬀect [35] in
completely new manner, i.e. from the few-body perspec-
tive. It is expected that upcoming experiments will give
some answers to still opened questions on the dynamical
properties of a few quantum particles [36, 37].

Motivated by these beautiful experiments, here we an-
alyze dynamical properties of the two-ﬂavored mixture
of a few fermions conﬁned in a one-dimensional double-
well potential. We consider a scenario with initially sep-
arated clouds of opposite fermions in distant traps which
are brought nearby instantaneously. This initial state cor-
responds to two magnetic domains of the famous Stoner
model [38] of itinerant ferromagnetism. However, it should
emphasized that this analogy originates in spatial separa-
tion rather than in interactions. Although, in the context
of cold-atoms, predictions of the model were qualitatively
conﬁrmed [39], some open questions are still under debate
and previous conclusions were questioned [40–42]. From
the few-body perspective it is also believed that some pre-
cursors of the Stoner domains can be experimentally ob-
served [25, 37]. The whole analysis is performed with nu-
merically direct and exact method originating in the exact

The model. – We consider an ultra-cold system of
fermions of mass m conﬁned in a one-dimensional double-
well potential and interacting via short-range interactions.
In the second quantization the Hamiltonian has a form:

where H0 = − ¯h2

dx2 + V (x) is the single-particle Hamil-
tonian with an external potential V (x). The ﬁeld operator
ˆΨσ(x) annihilates a fermion with spin σ ∈ {↑,↓} at point
x. Fermionic ﬁeld operators of a given spin obey standard
anti-commutation relations
= 0 and
= δ(x − x(cid:48)). We want to point out that
for the case studied here, dynamical equations generated
by the Hamiltonian (1) do not depend on the commuta-
tion relations assumed between the diﬀerent species atoms.
Typically, as both kinds of atoms belong to the fermion
family, one is tempted to assume anti-commutation rela-
tion between them. Note however, that our Hamiltonian
does not transform one kind of atoms into the other kind,
i.e. is a biquadratic form in ﬁeld operators and the same
dynamical equations will be obtained if commutation rules
are assumed instead (even number of commutation oper-
ations is required). The physical reason for this fact is
that in the model studied, both species are fundamen-
tally distinguishable [43]. In such a case the wave function
does not have to be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric
with respect to exchange of two particles of the diﬀerent
kind. It is quite obvious that the Hamiltonian (1) com-
mutes with the total number of fermions of a given spin

For convenience we model the double-well potential by

which is controlled by one parameter x0 of the dimension
of length. As it is seen, for x0 = 0 the potential has a
form of standard harmonic conﬁnement. For x0 > 0 it is a
symmetric double-well potential formed by two harmonic
conﬁnements of frequency Ω with minima shifted by ±x0.
Then, the barrier of the potential between wells is equal
x2
0/2 (see Fig. 1). One of the advantages of this double-
well model is the fact that the eigenenergies i and the
eigenstates ψi(x) of the single-particle part of the Hamil-
tonian are known and can be expressed by the parabolic
cylinder function (known also as the Webber function)
(see [44] for details). The spectrum of the single-particle
Hamiltonian as a function of the parameter x0 is presented
in Fig. 1. As it is expected, for large x0 a quasi-degeneracy
between even and odd eigenstates is present. In the limit

Fig. 1: Properties of the external potential used to model the
double-well conﬁnement. The parameter x0 simultaneously
controls the distance between wells and the barrier between
them. Note, that independently of x0, each well in the vicinity
of its minimum can be approximated by the harmonic traps
with ﬁxed frequency Ω. (right panel) Eigenergies of the single-
particle Hamiltonian H0 as functions of splitting parameter x0.
For x0 = 0 spectrum of the standard harmonic conﬁnement is
restored. In the limit x0 → ∞ two-fold degeneracy of harmonic
oscillator spectrum is obtained.

x0 → ∞ doubly degenerate spectrum of standard har-
monic oscillator is obtained. For dynamical problems in a
double-well potential it is convenient to introduce basis of
states localized in the left ϕLi(x) and in the right ϕRi(x)
well of the potential. They are simple superpositions of
neighboring eigenstates of the Hamiltonian:

ϕLi(x) = [ψ2i(x) + ψ2i+1(x)] /

ϕRi(x) = [ψ2i(x) − ψ2i+1(x)] /

(3b)
Of course, the localized states {ϕλi} are no longer eigen-
states of the single-particle Hamiltonian. However, its ma-
trix elements in the new basis are quite simple:

Dynamics of two distinguishable particles. – To
get better understanding of the dynamics in the model
studied, ﬁrst let us concentrate on the problem of two
distinguishable particles initially occupying distant wells,
i.e. we assume that initially the few-body state of the
system has the form

This particular state models a well established experimen-
tal scenario – opposite-spin particles are prepared in dis-
tant, not coupled traps and then suddenly they are shifted
closer. Due to the non-vanishing tunnelings the state is no
longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and it evolves in
time. Note, that this preparation procedure is almost in-
sensitive to the interaction strength g, since particles with
opposite spins occupy distant traps. Nevertheless, inter-
action plays a crucial role during the evolution. Therefore,
we can study the properties of the system as a function of
interaction with well established initial state.

The evolution of the system is governed by the many-
body Hamiltonian (6). Numerically, it can be determined
by an exact diagonalization in the many-body basis cut at
some large enough single particle level imax. Obviously,
the cut-oﬀ imax depends on the interaction g. In practice
it is determined by the condition that initial state is re-
constructed by the appropriate superposition of the eigen-
states with the ﬁdelity larger than 99%. After diagonal-
ization, the initial state is decomposed to the eigenstates
of the many-body Hamiltonian |Gi(cid:105) and its evolution is
given explicitly

Ei. With this approach we have an access to the whole
few-body state at any moment of the evolution. From
this point of view the method is exact and gives complete
description of the system.

Properties of the system during the evolution can be
examined in many ways. The simplest is to study the
evolution of the density proﬁles nσ(x) which are diagonal
parts of appropriate single-particle density matrices

(6) for N↑ = N↓ = 1 as a function of interaction coupling g
near the energy of the initial state. In the limit of inﬁnite re-
pulsions the ground-state of the system is doubly degenerated.
One of the states corresponds to the generalized Girardeau
state described in the main text. For particular attractive in-
teractions the degeneracy of the states in the vicinity of initial
state energy is increased. For this interactions an acceleration
of particle ﬂow through the barrier is observed (compare with
Fig. 2.). (right panel) The Schmidt number K denoting an
eﬀective number of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (6) in the
decomposition of the initial state. It is clear that K increases
whenever acceleration in the dynamics is observed.

In the simplest case of noninteracting particles the evo-
lution of the system is determined by the single-particle
tunneling t0 between the lowest single-particle levels. Sim-
ply, both particles oscillate between sites with Rabi fre-
quency t0/¯h (see Fig. 2a).

Situation changes when repulsive interactions are
present in the system. In this case higher single-particle
states, due to the couplings forced by interactions, are
coming into play. Typical behavior for repulsive forces are
presented in Fig. 2b,c. In this case mobility of particles
decreases with interaction strength – for stronger repul-
sions an eﬀective tunneling is strongly suppressed. This
behavior can be well explained with the energy conser-
vation arguments. The initial state (8) has well deﬁned
energy independently of g because the interaction energy,
due to the almost vanishing overlap between the densi-
ties, is negligibly small. The single-particle tunneling leads
to the few-body state in which both particles occupy the
same potential well. In this state the interaction energy
cannot be neglected and it is diﬀerent than the energy of
the initial state. Therefore, tunneling process is strongly
suppressed due to the discrepancy of the energies. The
evolution is allowed only due to the second-order process
in which particles exchange the wells. An eﬀective tunnel-
ing rate of this process is equal to t2
0/U , where U is the
interaction energy in the intermediate state. Therefore it
is suppressed by repulsions.

Generally, the picture drawn for repulsive forces is also
correct for attractions. In this case the conservation of the
energy acts in the same way and strongly suppresses the
exchange dynamics (Fig. 2d,e). However, for some par-

ticular attractions we ﬁnd that Rabi oscillations are accel-
erated (Fig. 2f). It happens for quite large interactions,
far from the perturbative regime. Therefore, this behavior
of the system cannot be explained with any single-particle
picture. The explanation comes from the direct inspection
of the decomposition of the initial state to the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian. The rapid oscillations occur in the
system for interactions at which additional eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian contribute to the state. It is indeed possi-
ble since for attractive forces the energies of excited eigen-
states decrease (left panel in Fig. 3). At the same time an
average energy of the initial state does not change due to
the vanishing overlap mentioned above (in the case stud-
ied it is approximately equal ¯hΩ). To show that this is
indeed the case we calculate an eﬀective number of exact
eigenstates K which contribute to the initial state. The
number is determined in close analogy to the well known
Schmidt number in the theory of reduced density matrices:

K =

1
|αi|4 .

(12)
As it is seen in the right panel in Fig. 3 number K increases
whenever additional eigenstates of the Hamiltonian have
energy close to the energy of the initial state. The contri-
bution of higher states to the initial state of the system has
clearly resonant character. It can be viewed as an eﬀect of
resonant coupling to higher single-particle levels, i.e. the
interaction term responsible for promoting two particles
from the ground to the excited state of a given well is
equal to the energy diﬀerence between them.
If so, the
single-particle tunneling in the excited level contributes
to the ﬂow of particles between sites.
In consequence,
particles tunnel with clearly larger frequency. From this
picture it is quite obvious that in the case of two distin-
guishable particles this mechanism cannot be present on
the repulsive side of interactions – there is no eigenstate
of the system which can contribute to the decomposition
of the initial state. However, in the vicinity of g = 0 the
ground-state of the system is quasi-degenerated (as seen
in Fig. 3). Therefore, the peak in K extends into the g¿0
side.

Many-body dynamics of

initially separated
clouds. – Now, let us concentrate on the situation more
complicated, when two pairs of particles are present. In
analogy to previous case we assume that initially both ﬂa-
vors are conﬁned in distant wells of the potential, i.e. the
few-body state has a form

We choose parameters of the potential in such a way that
an overlap between particles in distant sites is still very
small (here we set x0 = 2 in osc. units). Therefore, the
energy of the state is almost independent of the interaction
strength g and it is approximately equal to 4¯hΩ.

For non-interacting case the dynamics is governed in-
dependently at two energy levels with two diﬀerent tun-
neling rates. In consequence, the number of particles in

In this case the evolution is governed by two diﬀerent single-

lution of occupations has typical two-frequency behavior. (b-c)
Evolution for two example interactions (repulsive and attrac-

particle tunneling is suppressed and oscillations are delayed.
(d) Evolution for two, almost equal, strong attractive interac-
tions g = −1.3 (solid lines) and g = −1.4 (dashed lines). It is
clear that the dynamics in both cases is not comparable and
and some kind of ,,butterﬂy eﬀect” is visible, i.e. small change
in interactions leads to completely diﬀerent evolution of the
system. It is explained by complexity of the Hamiltonian spec-
trum in this region of interactions (see main text and Fig. 5).

particular well changes with characteristic two-frequency
oscillation (Fig. 4a). In the presence of interactions the
dynamics is qualitatively diﬀerent and more complicated
than in the case of two particles. For increasing repulsive
interactions we ﬁnd a characteristic delay in the density
ﬂow (Fig. 4b). However, in the case studied, the delay
is not monotonic with g and a resonant behavior induced
by interactions, previously observed only for attractions,
is present (Fig. 4c). For attractive forces the situation
is even more complicated. For large enough attractions,
small change of g drastically changes the dynamics of the
system and in practice the evolution of the densities is
hard to predict. As an example in Fig. 4d we plot the
evolution of densities for two close interactions g = 1.3
(red, blue lines with points) and g = 1.4 (red, blue dashed
lines). As it is seen, the similarity is visible only for short
time. Later, occupations evolve completely diﬀerently. It
suggests that in both cases the states evolve in completely
diﬀerent way. We conﬁrm this observation also with the
direct inspection of the structure of the state. Of course,

Fig. 5: (color online) (left panel) Spectrum of the many-body
Hamiltonian (6) as a function of interaction strength g for
N↑ = N↓ = 2. For clarity, an expectation energy of the initial
state (13) is marked with red dotted line. Complexity of the
spectrum on the attractive side makes the decomposition of the
initial state to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian completely
unpredictable. Therefore, an evolution of particles through the
barrier is very sensitive to small changes of interaction g (see
Fig. 4). This fact is also well captured by the Schmidt number
K of eﬀective number of eigenstates contributing to the initial
state (right panel). For attractive forces K is very irregular
function of g.

since the state of the system is decomposed eﬀectively to
a ﬁnite number of eigenstates of the system there exists a
ﬁnite period of time after which the system returns to the
initial state. However in practice, this time is very large
and many times larger than any reasonable scale of time
in the problem studied.

This highly nontrivial change in the evolution caused by
a small change of interaction can be explained when the
spectrum of the many-body Hamiltonian is plotted (left
panel in Fig. 5). For repulsive forces there are only a few
eigenstates with the energies close to the energy of the
initial state. Therefore, the dynamics is relatively sim-
ple and predictable. Only for some particular interactions
more eigenstates contribute to the initial state and then
speed-up of the transfer through the barrier is observed.
For attractive forces the spectrum is essentially more com-
plicated and a systematic description of the decomposition
of the initial state to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian
is in practice impossible. This fact is reﬂected in a rapid
changes of the Schmidt number K plotted in the right
panel in Fig. 5. We checked that the same mechanism
of unpredictability is present when small changes in the
double-well potential are considered. Small change of x0
leads to small changes of all parameters of the Hamilto-
nian. However, these small changes lead to a completely
diﬀerent evolution of the system.

At this point it worth noticing that in the spectrum
of the many-body Hamiltonian (6) (left panel in Fig. 5)
there exists the state whose eigenenergy does not depend
on the interaction g. This is a generalization of the well
known Girardeau state to the case of a double-well po-
tential [45, 46]. This state has a form of the single Slater

determinant of the lowest N single-particle orbitals of the
external potential, i.e.
it is totally antisymmetric under
exchange of position of any two fermions independently of
their spin. Consequently, interaction part of the Hamilto-
nian vanishes in this state.

The results obtained may suggest that in the attractive
part of the interactions the dynamics has chaotic features
and can be explained by chaotic properties of the spectrum
of the many-body Hamiltonian. To check this possibility
we have tested the nearest neighbor spacing distribution
for the energy levels in the spectrum for many diﬀerent
interactions. In this analysis we did not ﬁnd any traces
of Wigner distribution. Contrary, the spectrum is close
to the Poisson distribution. Therefore, the system is most
likely not chaotic, although we have access to a limited
number of eigenvalues. The dynamics is complicated and
unpredictable due to the large number of eigenstates of
diﬀerent energies rather than to the quantum chaotic fea-
tures of the spectrum.

Conclusions. – To conclude, in this paper we studied
dynamical properties of a few ultra-cold fermions conﬁned
in a double-well potential modeled with a double oscillator
shape. We have shown that for larger number of fermions
the dynamics is strongly aﬀected by details of the poten-
tial and interaction strength between fermions of opposite
spin. Particularly, ﬂow of the particles through the bar-
rier can be rapidly accelerated or slowed down for small
adjustments of interactions. We have shown that this fact
is closely related to the number of eigenstates of the full
many-body Hamiltonian which has energy close to the av-
erage energy of the initial state. From this point of view
it is quite natural that unpredictability of the dynamics
is much stronger for attractive forces where spectrum of
the Hamiltonian is much more complicated and irregu-
lar. What is worth noticing, we found that also for repul-
sive forces there exists such range of interactions for which
the ﬂow of particles is accelerated. Of course the results
presented are just the ﬁrst step to understand dynamics
of few-particle systems governed by collective correlations
between them. One of the simplest open questions is re-
lated to analogous properties of imbalanced mixture of
fermions of the same or diﬀerent masses. We believe that
our ﬁndings can stimulate upcoming experiments with sys-
tems of a few ultra-cold fermions.
