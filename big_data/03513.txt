Based on fundamental properties of light scattering by a particle we reveal the existence of the
ultimate upper limit for the light absorption by any partial mode. First, we obtain this result for
scattering of a plane wave by a symmetric spherical or inﬁnite cylindrical structure of an arbitrary
radius. Then, we generalize it to an arbitrary ﬁnite obstacle. Importantly, the result is true for any
polarization, any angle of incidence of the plane wave and any type of the structure (homogeneous,
stratiﬁed, or with smoothly variable refractive index). The corresponding maximal partial cross-
section is a universal quantity, which does not depend on the optical constants of the scatterer its
radius, and even its shape.

The problem of laser heating of absorbing particles in
transparent media is important for various applications.
Initially, the interest in this problem was related to the
optical damage to transparent media initiated by such
particles [1, 2]. Then, the area of applications of the
problem has expanded dramatically. Nowadays, it in-
cludes (but is not limited to) broadband solar light ab-
sorption [3, 4], cancer therapy and diagnosis [5, 6], micro-
surgery [7], drug and gene delivery and release [8, 9], and
nanoscale control of temperature distribution [10]. Lo-
cal, nanoscale laser heating of magnetic materials beyond
the Curie temperature may be employed for superhigh-
density data recording and storage [11], etc.

In most of these problems the optimization of the heat-
ing of particles is highly desirable [12–14]. The ﬁrst step
towards the optimization is the selection of the optical
parameters of the scattering particle so that they maxi-
mize the absorption cross-section. A number of publica-
tions have been devoted to this important subject, see,
e.g., [12, 13, 15–20]. Meanwhile, the fundamental ques-
tion, whether there is the ultimate upper limit for the
absorption in light scattering by an obstacle with a given
size and shape, and if so, what is the value of this limit,
still remains open.

It should be emphasized that, while in 1D cases the
absorbed power density in principle cannot exceed the
incident one, 2D and 3D cases are qualitatively diﬀerent.
Speciﬁcally, in the 2D and 3D cases at optical resonances
a scatterer acts as a funnel, collecting the incident ra-
diation from a wide “inlet” in the “upstream” area and
delivering the electromagnetic ﬁeld to a small “outlet” —
the proximity of the scattering obstacle [14, 21]. It may
result in a huge enhancement of the ﬁeld, concentrat-
ing within the scatterer and the power dissipated there.
Thus, the answer to the question about the ultimate ab-
sorption in 2D and 3D is far from obvious.

We should note, that certain speciﬁc cases related to
this question have been discussed already. For example,
in previous publication of one of the authors (MIT) [12]
it has been shown that such a limit indeed exists at the
scattering of a plane, linearly polarized electromagnetic
wave by a small (relative to the wavelength of the inci-
dent light), spatially uniform plasmonic sphere. Similar
results have been reported in Ref. [22]. The correspond-
ing maximal partial scattering cross-section is given by
the following simple expression:

σ((cid:96))
abs max =

(2(cid:96) + 1)π

2k2

,

(1)

where (cid:96) stands for the multipolarity of the plasmonic
resonance ((cid:96) = 1 — dipolar, (cid:96) = 2 — quadrupolar, etc.)
and k designates the wavenumber of the incident light
in a vacuum. The maximal absorption is achieved at
small value of the imaginary part of the particle permit-
tivity, when the partial scattering cross-section becomes
equal to the absorption. Note, that the above expres-
sion for σ((cid:96))
abs max does not depend on the particle radius
and its optical constants. An analogous conclusion may
be made from the results of publication [23], where the
light scattering by an inﬁnite circular cylinder with the
perpendicular incidence of the scattered wave with the
so-called TE polarization has been discussed.

Note also the resent attempts to achieve the total ab-
sorption by a plasmonic nanoparticle irradiated by the
adequately shaped incident beam [24]. A natural exten-
sion of this attempt to the irradiation by a plane inci-
dent wave would be the vanishing of the scattering cross-
section, so that the extinction cross becomes equal to the
absorption one. However, such an equality cannot be the
case, since it contradicts to the optical theorem, stipu-
lating that the extinction cross-section is proportional to
a certain amplitude component of the forward scattered

wave [25, 26]. Thus, any absorption is inevitably accom-
panied by some scattering. It makes the question about
the ultimate absorption closely related to the scattering
problem, see below.

In the present paper we reveal existence of the ulti-
mate upper limit for the absorption of any partial wave
for an arbitrary ﬁnite 3D or 2D single scatter for any po-
larization of the incident wave, its angle of incidence and
material parameters of the scatterer. In particular, our
results remain valid for multi-layered structures and the
ones with a smoothly variable proﬁle of the permittivity.

To begin with, let us discuss the well known exact so-
lutions for the light scattering by a homogeneous sphere
and cylinder [25, 26]. In the case of a sphere the scat-
tering cross-sections may be presented as a series of the
so-called partial cross-sections:

The expression for σsph (b,(cid:96))
is obtained from Eq. (3) by
the replacement a → b. Here a(cid:96) and b(cid:96) are the electric
and magnetic complex scattering coeﬃcients.

The absorption cross-section also may be presented as

an analogous series with the partial cross-section

The case with a cylinder is more cumbersome. The
point is that to ﬁnd the solution of the diﬀraction prob-
lem at an arbitrary angle of incidence of a plane, lin-
early polarized electromagnetic wave the incident radi-
ation should be presented as a sum of the TE and TM
modes. The same is true for the scattered ﬁeld. As a
result, instead of a single scattering and single absorp-
tion cross-section there are four pairs of them (for the
cylinder they are related to a unit length of the cylinder)
corresponding to the following partitions: TE → TE,
TE → TM, TM → TE and TM → TM. It is convenient
to write them as matrix entries, where indices 1 and 2
correspond to the TM and TE modes, respectively. Re-
garding the scattered coeﬃcients, usually, to distinguish
the notations for TM and TE modes from the multipo-
larity index n instead of Arabic 1 and 2 Roman numer-
als I and II are employed [25]. Then, the diagonal and
oﬀ-diagonal elements of the partial cross-sections are as

The scattering coeﬃcients for the sphere are expressed
in terms of the Riccati-Bessel functions. For the cylinder
the Bessel functions are employed. Even in the simplest
case of a spatially homogeneous scatterer the expressions
are cumbersome and will not be presented here. For more
details, see, e.g., books [25, 26].

ij sca and σcyl

A remarkable thing, however, is that Eqs. (3), (5)–(6)
have a similar universal structure. The same is true for
Eqs. (4), (7).
It should be stressed that Eqs. (2)–(7)
and others analogous for components of σcyl
ij abs
are nothing but a direct consequence of the optical theo-
rem [25, 26], presentation of the solution of the Maxwell
equations in the series of spherical (cylindrical) harmon-
ics and orthogonality of the harmonics with diﬀerent val-
ues of (cid:96). The structure of these equations has nothing to
do with the value and/or coordinate dependence of the
complex permittivity of the scatterer  = (cid:48) + i(cid:48)(cid:48) [27],
provided this dependence does not violate the spheri-
cal (cylindrical) symmetry of the one. Such a depen-
dence, if any, aﬀects just the values of the scattering
coeﬃcients. Therefore, Eqs. (3)–(7) are valid for any
spherically (cylindrically) symmetric distribution of , in-
cluding its constant value (a spatially homogeneous scat-
terer); any smoothly variable (r); and a stratiﬁed scat-
terer, consisting of a number of layers with a stepwise
variation of  at transition from one layer to another.

Thus, to maximize any partial absorption cross-section
in a given scattering partition one has to ﬁnd a maximum
of the expression

Re(cid:0)z − |z|2(cid:1) ,

As it has been mentioned above, the speciﬁc values of
the scattering coeﬃcients depend on the size parameter
q = Rk, where R is the radius of the sphere (cylinder),
and the proﬁle (r). However, it is important that all
these coeﬃcients also have a universal structure and may

z =

F

F + iG

≡ 1

1 + iζ

.

(9)

Here ζ ≡ G/F . F and G are rather cumbersome func-
tions [25, 26], whose explicit form is not required here.

To prove the possibility of this presentation of z in
all the cases mentioned above we will follow the gen-
eral arguments of Ref.
[28]. Note that in the non-
dissipative limit with (cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 any partial absorption
cross-section vanishes identically, i.e., |z|2 = Re z. Let
z = µ + iχ. Then, the condition |z|2 = Re z may be
rewritten as 0 ≤ µ2 = µ − χ2 ≤ µ. It results in the con-
straint: 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1.

On the other hand, any real, nonnegative quantity,
does not exceeding unity may be presented as the fraction

µ ≡

F 2

F 2 + G2 ,

(10)

where F and G are real. Eq. (10), together with the
equality χ2 = µ − µ2, which implies

χ ≡ ± F G

F 2 + G2 ,

(11)

bring about Eq. (9).

However, the above proof in based on the vanishing of
the partial absorption cross-section. For this reason it is
valid in the non-dissipative case only. It may seem that at
a ﬁnite (cid:48)(cid:48) the numerator and/or denominator of Eq. (9)
might have additional terms, violating this presentation.
If so, these terms should be proportional to a certain
positive power of (cid:48)(cid:48), since they must vanish at (cid:48)(cid:48) → 0.
Now note that in the initial boundary value problem, de-
scribing the scattering, (cid:48)(cid:48) enters only through  = (cid:48)+i(cid:48)(cid:48),
and any constructive solution of the problem determin-
ing the scattering coeﬃcients does not separate i(cid:48)(cid:48) from
(cid:48). Thus, at a transition from the non-dissipative limit to
the case of ﬁnite dissipation the only way for (cid:48)(cid:48) to enter
Eq. (9) is to do that through the analytical continuation
of real  to the complex plane, i.e., through the formal
replacement (cid:48) → (cid:48) + i(cid:48)(cid:48). It makes the functions F and
G complex, but, naturally, does not violate the structure
of Eq. (9).

Of course, in any speciﬁc case one can arrive at the
same conclusion by means of direct calculations, though
they may be rather cumbersome. An example of these
calculations for the normal incidence of a plane wave on
a stratiﬁed sphere can be found in Ref. [29].

Bearing all this in mind, Eq. (8) may be reduced to

the following form:

Re z − |z|2 = −

y

(1 − y)2 + x2 ,

(12)

where x = Re ζ, y = Im ζ.

3

Since up to a certain positive prefactor Eq. (12) equal
to a partial absorption cross-section, which, by the def-
inition, is a non-negative quantity, the ﬁrst conclusion
we can make is that y = Im G/F ≤ 0. The generic form
of this restriction may be veriﬁed by direct calculations
based upon the explicit expressions for F and G [25, 26].
It is seen straightforwardly that Eq. (12) is maximized
at x = 0 and y = −1. The maximal value is 1/4. Note
also, that at these values of x and y the following equality
holds: |z|2 = Re z−|z|2 = 1/4, i.e., the partial absorption
and scattering cross-sections equal each other.
It is easy to see that, actually, the partial absorption
and scattering cross-sections equal each other at y = −1
and any value of x. However, only at x = 0 this equality
holds at the point of the local maximum of the absorption
cross-section.
Another important point is that at x = 0 and y = −1
iζ = 1, i.e., z = 1/2 being a purely real quantity.
It
provides the opportunity to detect the occurrence of the
ultimate maximal absorption just measuring the value of
the corresponding partial extinction or scattering cross-
section together with the phase shift between the incident
ﬁeld and the one scattered by the obstacle to the corre-
sponding multipolar partition.

Collecting all together we may conclude that
• For the problems in question the ultimate upper
limit for a partial absorption cross-sections exists
indeed.

• The corresponding values for a sphere equal the
one, obtained earlier in Ref. [22, 28] for the case of
a small plasmonic particle, see Eq. (1).

• For a cylinder the maximal partial absorption
cross-section equals π/k at (cid:96) = 0 and double of
that at any other values of (cid:96).

• To maximize the partial cross-section the two con-
ditions: Re(G/F ) = 0 and Im(G/F ) = −1 must be
satisﬁed simultaneously.

• If the conditions Re(G/F ) = 0 and Im(G/F ) = −1
hold, the corresponding partial absorption and
scattering cross-sections equal each other, while the
complex scattering coeﬃcient equals 1/2, becoming
a purely real quantity. In this case the partial scat-
tering cross-section for a sphere is also given by
Eq. (1). For a cylinder it equals π/k ((cid:96) = 0), or
2π/k ((cid:96) (cid:54)= 0). The corresponding extinction cross-
section is double of these values.

There are several important issues to be be clariﬁed in
view of these results. First, the aforementioned analysis
indicates that any partial absorption cross-section for a
single scattering partition cannot exceed the obtained ul-
timate maximal values. However, it does not mean that
these ultimate maxima may be always achieved. Just

opposite — as a rule for actual optical materials the two
conditions Re(G/F ) = 0 and Im(G/F ) = −1 are in-
consistent and cannot hold together. In these cases the
actual maximal values of the partial absorption cross-
section become smaller (sometimes much smaller) than
the obtained ultimate limit.

Second, intuitively it seems that the maximal absorp-
tion should happen close to the resonant frequencies,
when the electromagnetic ﬁeld, corresponding to the res-
onant mode, is maximal. In some cases this is true, in-
deed. For example, for a small (q (cid:28) 1), weakly dis-
sipating ((cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:28) 1) particle functions F and G are al-
most purely real [12]. Then, Re(G/F ) ≈ Re G/Re F
and the condition Re(G/F ) = 0 is satisﬁed in the vicin-
ity of the roots of equation Re G = 0 (function F al-
ways remains ﬁnite). On the other hand, in this case
the characteristic value of F is small (e.g., for a sphere
F (a,(cid:96)) ∼ q2(cid:96)+1, F (b,(cid:96)) ∼ q2(cid:96)+3), while the characteristic
value of G is of the order of unity. Thus, the condition
Re G = 0 approximately deﬁnes the poles of the scatter-
ing coeﬃcients, i.e., the points of resonances, see Ref. [12]
for more details.

However, such cases are rather exceptional. In a gen-
eral, case functions F and G are of the same order of
magnitude, and the roots of the equations Re(G/F ) = 0
and Im(G/F ) = −1 (if any) may have nothing to do with
the resonant frequencies. It should also be stressed that
when F and G are of the same order and the dissipation
is not small, the deﬁnition of the resonances itself is not
trivial and requires clariﬁcation.

crests in the two reliefs are seen clearly. Within the
range of variation of  presented in Fig. 1 there are just
two points of the maxima of the partial absorption cross-
section, namely  ≈ 4.968+i1.362 and  ≈ 14.780+i1.278

It may be expected that the positions of the maxima
of a partial cross-section are associated with those for
the modulus of the amplitude of the corresponding par-
tial mode excited within the scatterer. However, the de-
tailed discussion of this point lies beyond the scope of
the present Letter and will be reported elsewhere, see
also our recent paper [31].

Third, the obtained ultimate limits are the upper
bounds for a partial cross-section for a single scattering

partition, while the net cross-section is a sum of an inﬁ-
nite number of the partial cross-sections, corresponding
to each partition separately. If the maximization condi-
tions Re(G/F ) = 0 and Im(G/F ) = −1 may be satisﬁed
for a number of partitions simultaneously, it may result
in a considerable enhancement of the net cross-section.

Fourth, if a scatterer has additional variable parame-
ters, it provides more freedom to tune the scatterer to the
enhanced absorption. For example, a stratiﬁed scatterer,
consisting of several layers of diﬀerent materials with dif-
ferent thickness, obeys essentially the same rules. In this
case tuning of the thickness of the layers and their per-
mittivities may allow to achieve overlap of the maximal
absorption, produced by diﬀerent modes, i.g., dipolar and
quadrupolar, and to build up a “superabsorber” [32, 33]

10121416180.10.20.30.40.50.6ϵ'Qsca,abssph(a,1)in the same manner as it was suggested in Ref. [23] for a
“superscatterer”.

A few words about the partial scattering and extinction
cross-sections should be added. Up to a ceratin positive
prefactor the former and the latter equal Re z and |z|2,
respectively [21, 25, 28], where z is deﬁned according to
Eq. (8). Bearing in mind that Im ζ ≤ 0, it is easy to see
that both the quantities are maximized at ζ = 0, i.e., at
G = 0, If this condition holds, z = 1 and the scatter-
ing cross-section equals the extinction one. Obviously, it
can happen in the non-dissipative limit only (i.e., only in
this limit the equation G = 0 has physically meaningful
roots). In other words, the ultimate maximal values for
the partial extinction and scattering cross-sections are
realized at (cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 (see Fig. 1) at the resonances corre-
sponding to the anomalous scattering [34, 35].

What happens in the case of an arbitrary scatterer,
which does not possess the spherical, or cylindrical sym-
metry? The multipolar expansion for this case is dis-
cussed in Ref. [36]. The only diﬀerence between this
general case and symmetrical, discussed above is that
violation of the symmetry removes the degeneracy of the
expansion in spherical (cylindrical) harmonics, so that it
occurs of the general type, i.e., the sums in Eqs. (2), (5)
are transformed as follows:

∞(cid:88)

(cid:96)=1

→

∞(cid:88)

(cid:96)(cid:88)

.

(cid:96)=1

m=−(cid:96)

All the rest remains the same. Obviously this transfor-
mation does not aﬀect the general reasoning presented
above.

Thus, we have revealed a new fundamental feature of
the light scattering problem. Based on the optical theo-
rem, which relates the extinction, scattering and absorp-
tion cross-sections, we have proven rigorously the exis-
tence of the ultimate upper limit for the partial absorp-
tion cross-section for every individual scattering mode in
the multipolar expansion for an arbitrary scattering ob-
ject. In particular, we demonstrate our results for light
scattering by a specially uniform sphere or cylinder of
arbitrary sizes and internal structure. We have obtained
the conditions for the limit to be achieved and the simple
explicit expressions for the values of the partial absorp-
tion cross-sections at this limit. It occurs that this value
is a fundamental quantity, which does not depend on the
optical properties of the scatterer and/or its size. We be-
lieve the results shed a new light on this important prob-
lem and may stimulate further study of the phenomenon.
