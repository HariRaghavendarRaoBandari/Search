Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

Caucher Birkar

Abstract. In this paper, we study the linear systems | − mKX | on Fano varieties X with
klt singularities. In a given dimension d, we prove | − mKX | is non-empty and contains an
element with ”good singularities” for some number m depending only on d; if in addition
X is ǫ-lc for some ǫ > 0, then we show that we can choose m depending only on d and ǫ
so that | − mKX| deﬁnes a birational map. Further, we prove Shokurov’s conjecture on
boundedness of complements, and show that certain classes of Fano varieties form bounded
families.

1. Introduction

We work over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Given a smooth projec-
tive variety W , the minimal model program predicts that W is birational to a projective
variety Y with canonical singularities such that either KY is ample, or Y admits a ﬁbration
whose general ﬁbres X are Calabi-Yau varieties or Fano varieties.
In other words, one
may say that, birationally, every variety is in some sense constructed from varieties X with
good singularities such that either KX is ample or numerically trivial or anti-ample. So
it is quite natural to study such special varieties with the hope of obtaining some sort of
classiﬁcation theory. They are also very interesting in moduli theory, arithmetic geometry,
and mathematical physics.

When X is one-dimensional the linear system |KX | determines its geometry to a large
extent. However, in higher dimension, one needs to study |mKX | or | − mKX| for all m ∈ N
(depending on the type of X) in order to investigate the geometry of X. If KX is ample,
then there is m depending only on the dimension such that |mKX| deﬁnes a birational em-
bedding into some projective space, by Hacon-McKernan [12] and Takayama [39]. If KX is
numerically trivial, there is m such that |mKX| is non-empty but it is not clear whether we
can choose m depending only on the dimension. When KX is anti-ample, that is when X is
Fano, in this paper we study boundedness and singularity properties of the linear systems
| − mKX | in a quite general setting in conjunction with Shokurov’s theory of complements.

Eﬀective non-vanishing. Our ﬁrst result is a consequence of boundedness of complements

(1.7 below). We state it separately because it involves little technicalities.

Theorem 1.1. Let d be a natural number. Then there is a natural number m depending
only on d such that if X is any Fano variety of dimension d with klt singularities, then the

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

3

linear system | − mKX | is non-empty, that is, h0(−mKX) 6= 0. Moreover, the linear system
contains a divisor M such that (X, 1

m M ) has lc singularities.

Obviously the statement also holds if we replace Fano with the more general notion of
weak Fano, that is, if −KX is nef and big. The theorem was proved by Shokurov in dimen-
sion two [37].

Eﬀective birationality for ǫ-lc Fano varieties. If we bound the singularities of X, we

then have a much stronger statement than the non-vanishing of 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let d be a natural number and ǫ > 0 a real number. Then there is a
natural number m depending only on d and ǫ such that if X is any ǫ-lc weak Fano variety
of dimension d, then | − mKX | deﬁnes a birational map.

Note that m indeed depends on d as well as ǫ because the theorem implies the volume
vol(−KX) is bounded from below by 1
md . Without the ǫ-lc assumption, vol(−KX ) can get
arbitrarily small or large [14, Example 2.1.1]. In dimension 2, the theorem is a consequence
of Alexeev [3], and in dimension 3, special cases are proved by Jiang [19] using diﬀerent
methods.

Boundedness of certain classes of Fano varieties. Fano varieties come in two ﬂavours:
non-exceptional and exceptional. A Fano variety X is non-exceptional if there is 0 ≤ P ∼Q
−KX such that (X, P ) is not klt. Otherwise we say X is exceptional. In the non-exceptional
case we can create non-klt centres which sometimes can be used to do induction, i.e.
lift
sections and complements from such centres (eg, see 6.8 below). We do not have that luxury
in the exceptional case. Instead we show that there is a ”limited number” of them, that is:

Theorem 1.3. Let d be a natural number. Then the set of exceptional weak Fano varieties
of dimension d forms a bounded family.

Exceptional pairs and generalised polarised pairs can be deﬁned similarly. We will extend
1.3 to such pairs (see 1.10 below) which is important for our proofs. In a diﬀerent direction
we have:

Theorem 1.4. Let d be a natural number, and ǫ and δ be positive real numbers. Consider
projective varieties X satisfying:

• (X, B) is ǫ-lc of dimension d for some boundary B,
• B is big and KX + B ∼R 0, and
• the coeﬃcients of B are more than or equal to δ.

Then the set of such X forms a bounded family.

Hacon and Xu proved the theorem assuming the coeﬃcients of B belong to a ﬁxed DCC
set of rational numbers [16, Theorem 1.3] relying on the special case when −KX is ample
[14, Corollary 1.7]. The theorem can be viewed as a special case of the following conjecture
due to Alexeev and Borisov brothers.

Conjecture 1.5 (BAB). Let d be a natural number and ǫ a positive real number. Then
the set of ǫ-lc Fano varieties X of dimension d forms a bounded family.

The results and ideas developed in this paper will hopefully lead to an eventual proof of
this conjecture. The conjecture is often stated in the log case for pairs (X, B) but it is not
hard to reduce it to the above version. The conjecture has been proved in dimension two
[3], for smooth X [29], for toric X [9], for threefolds of Picard number one and terminal

4

singularities [24], for threefolds with canonical singularities [30], in dimension three with
KX having bounded Cartier index [8], and in any dimension with KX having bounded
Cartier index [14, Corollary 1.8 ].

Next we show 1.5 in lower dimension implies a weak form of 1.5, more precisely:

Theorem 1.6. Let d be a natural number and ǫ a positive real number. Assume Conjecture
1.5 holds in dimension d − 1. Then there is a number v depending only on d and ǫ such
that if X is an ǫ-lc weak Fano variety of dimension d, then vol(−KX ) ≤ v. In particular,
such X are birationally bounded.

In dimension 3, the boundedness of vol(−KX) was proved by Lai [32] for X of Picard
number one and by Jiang [20] in general who also proves the birational boundedness of X in
[19] using diﬀerent methods. Theorem 1.6 gives new proofs of their results since Conjecture
1.5 is known in dimension 2.

Boundedness of complements. Shokurov introduced the theory of complements while
investigating threefold log ﬂips [38, §5]. The notion of complement involves both bound-
edness and singularities of the linear systems | − mKX |. It is actually deﬁned in the more
general setting of pairs. See 2.9 for relevant deﬁnitions.

The following theorem was conjectured by Shokurov [37, Conjecture 1.3] who proved it

in dimension 2 [37, Theorem 1.4] (see also [34, Corollary 1.8], and [38] for some cases).

Theorem 1.7. Let d be a natural number and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational numbers.
Then there exists a natural number n divisible by I(R) and depending only on d and R
satisfying the following. Assume (X, B) is a projective pair such that

• (X, B) is lc of dimension d,
• B ∈ Φ(R), that is, the coeﬃcients of B are in Φ(R),
• X is Fano type, and
• −(KX + B) is nef.

Then there is an n-complement KX + B+ of KX + B such that B+ ≥ B. Moreover, the
complement is also an mn-complement for any m ∈ N. In particular, if we let B = T + ∆
where T = ⌊B⌋, then the linear system

is not empty.

| − nKX − nT − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ |

Here I(R) denotes the smallest natural number so that Ir ∈ Z for every r ∈ R, and
Φ(R) is the set of hyperstandard multiplicities associated to R (see 2.1). Fano type means
(X, G) is klt and −(KX + G) is ample for some boundary G.

Prokhorov and Shokurov [35][34] prove various inductive statements regarding comple-
ments. They [34, Theorem 1.4] also show that 1.7 follows from two conjectures in the same
dimension : the BAB conjecture (1.5 above) and the adjunction conjecture for ﬁbre spaces
[34, Conjectue 7.13]. In dimension 3, one only needs the BAB [34, Corollary 1.7], and this
also can be dropped if in addition we assume (X, B) is non-exceptional.

Both the BAB and the adjunction conjectures are very diﬃcult problems. In this paper
we replace the BAB with its special cases 1.3 and 1.4, and we replace the adjunction conjec-
ture with the theory of generalised polarised pairs developed in [7]. See [36] for Shokurov’s
work on adjunction.

Boundedness of complements in the relative setting. Complements are also deﬁned in
the relative setting for a given contraction X → Z (see 2.9). In particular, when X → Z

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

is the identity morphism, boundedness of complements is simply a local statement about
singularities near a point on X.

Theorem 1.8. Let d be a natural number and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational numbers.
Then there exists a natural number n divisible by I(R) and depending only on d and R
satisfying the following. Assume (X, B) is a pair and X → Z a contraction such that

• (X, B) is lc of dimension d and dim Z > 0,
• B ∈ Φ(R),
• X is Fano type over Z, and
• −(KX + B) is nef over Z.

Then for any point z ∈ Z, there is an n-complement KX + B+ of KX + B over z such that
B+ ≥ B. Moreover, the complement is also an mn-complement for any m ∈ N.

The theorem was proved by Shokurov [37] in dimension 2, and by Prokhorov and
Shokurov [35] in dimension 3. They also essentially show that 1.8 in dimension d fol-
lows from 1.7 in dimension d − 1 [35, Theorem 3.1].

Boundedness of complements for generalised polarised pairs. We prove boundedness
of complements in the even more general setting of generalised polarised pairs. This is of
independent interest but also fundamental to our proofs. It gives enough ﬂexibility for our
inductive arguments to go through unlike Theorem 1.7. For the relevant deﬁnitions, see 2.6
and 2.9.

Theorem 1.9. Let d and p be natural numbers and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational
numbers. Then there exists a natural number n divisible by pI(R) and depending only
on d, p, and R satisfying the following. Assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is a projective generalised
polarised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and M such that

• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc of dimension d,
• B′ ∈ Φ(R) and pM is Cartier,
• X ′ is Fano type, and
• −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef.

Then there is an n-complement KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ of KX ′ + B′ + M ′ such that B′+ ≥ B′.
Moreover, the complement is also an mn-complement for any m ∈ N.

Generalised polarised pairs behave similar to usual pairs in many ways. For example also

see the eﬀective birationality results for polarised pairs of general type established in [7].

Boundedness of exceptional pairs. As mentioned earlier, in order to carry out our

inductive arguments we need boundedness of exceptional pairs as in the next result.

Theorem 1.10. Let d and p be natural numbers and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational
numbers. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be as in Theorem 1.9 and assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional.
Then (X ′, B′) is log bounded.

About this paper. The main tools used in this paper are the minimal model program
[31][6], the theory of complements [35][34][37], creating families of non-klt centres using
volumes [14][15][26, §6], and the theory of generalised polarised pairs [7].

We brieﬂy outline the structure of the paper. In Sections 2, we gather some of the tools
used in the paper, and prove certain basic results. In Section 3, we discuss various types of

6

Caucher Birkar

adjunction, recall some known results, and prove some new results (eg, 3.11, 3.13) crucial
for later sections. In Section 4, we prove 1.2 under some additional assumptions (4.4, 4.5,
4.7). In Section 5, we prove 1.4. In Section 6, we develop the theory of complements for
generalised polarised pairs, and prove various inductive statements (eg, 6.5, 6.8), and discuss
behaviour of boundary coeﬃcients under adjunction for ﬁbre spaces (6.3). In Section 7,
we study exceptional pairs and treat 1.3 and 1.10 inductively (eg, 7.3, 7.5, 7.9, 7.15). In
Section 8, we discuss complements in the relative setting (8.2). In Section 9, we prove 1.6.
Finally, in Section 10, we give the proofs of all the main results except those proved earlier.
It is worth mentioning that some of the results stated for varieties only can be easily

extended to the log case (eg, 1.2, 1.6) but for simplicity we treat the non-log case only.

2. Preliminaries

All the varieties in this paper are deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic

zero unless stated otherwise.

2.1. Hyperstandard sets. For a subset V ⊆ R and a number a ∈ R, we deﬁne V ≥a =
{v ∈ V | v ≥ a}. We similarly deﬁne V ≤a, V <a, and V >a.
Let R be a subset of [0, 1]. Following [34, 3.2] we deﬁne

Φ(R) = {1 −

r
m

| r ∈ R, m ∈ N}

to be the set of hyperstandard multiplicities associated to R. We usually assume 0, 1 ∈ R
without mention, so Φ(R) includes Φ({0, 1}), the set of usual standard multiplicities. Note
that if we add 1 − r to R for each r ∈ R, then we get R ⊂ Φ(R).

Now assume R ⊂ [0, 1] is a ﬁnite set of rational numbers. Then Φ(R) is a DCC set of
rational numbers whose only accumulation point is 1. Let I = I(R) be the smallest natural
number so that Ir ∈ Z for every r ∈ R. If n ∈ N is divisible by I(R), then nb ≤ ⌊(n + 1)b⌋
for every b ∈ Φ(R) [34, Lemma 3.5].

2.2. Divisors and morphisms. Let X be a normal variety, and let M be an R-divisor
on X. We often write H i(M ) instead of H i(X, OX (⌊M ⌋)) and write |M | instead of | ⌊M ⌋ |.
We denote the coeﬃcient of a prime divisor D in M by µDM . If every non-zero coeﬃcient
of M belongs to a set Φ ⊆ R, we write M ∈ Φ. Writing M = P miMi where Mi are the
distinct irreducible components, the notation M ≥a means Pmi≥a miMi, that is, we ignore
the components with coeﬃcient < a. One similarly deﬁnes M ≤a, M >a, and M <a.
Now let f : X → Z be a morphism to a normal variety. We say M is horizontal over Z
if the induced map Supp M → Z is dominant, otherwise we say M is vertical over Z. If N
is an R-Cartier divisor on Z, we often denote f ∗N by N |X .

Again let f : X → Z be a morphism to a normal variety, and let M and L to be R-Cartier
divisors on X, and z ∈ Z. We say M ∼ L over z (resp. M ∼Q L over z)(resp. M ∼R L
over z) if there is a Cartier (resp. Q-Cartier)(resp. R-Cartier) divisor N on Z such that
M − L ∼ f ∗N (resp. M − L ∼Q f ∗N )(resp. M − L ∼R f ∗N ) holds over a neighbourhood
of z.

For a birational map X 99K X ′ (resp. X 99K X ′′)(resp. X 99K X ′′′)(resp. X 99K Y )
whose inverse does not contract divisors, and for an R-divisor M on X we denote the
pushdown of M to X ′ (resp. X ′′)(resp. X ′′′)(resp. Y ) by M ′ (resp. M ′′)(resp. M ′′′)(resp.
MY ).

2.3. Pairs. In this paper a sub-pair (X, B) consists of a normal quasi-projective variety X
and an R-divisor B such that KX + B is R-Cartier. If the coeﬃcients of B are at most 1
we say B is a sub-boundary, and if in addition B ≥ 0, we say B is a boundary. A sub-pair
(X, B) is called a pair if B ≥ 0 (we allow coeﬃcients of B to be larger than 1 for practical
reasons).

Let φ : W → X be a log resolution of a sub-pair (X, B). Let KW + BW be the pulback
of KX + B. The log discrepancy of a prime divisor D on W with respect to (X, B) is
1 − µDBW and it is denoted by a(D, X, B). We say (X, B) is sub-lc (resp. sub-klt)(resp.
sub-ǫ-lc) if every coeﬃcient of BW is ≤ 1 (resp. < 1)(resp. ≤ 1 − ǫ). When (X, B) is a
pair we remove the sub and say the pair is lc, etc. Note that if (X, B) is a lc pair, then the
coeﬃcients of B necessarily belong to [0, 1].

Let (X, B) be a sub-pair. A non-klt place of (X, B) is a prime divisor D on birational
models of X such that a(D, X, B) ≤ 0. A non-klt centre is the image on X of a non-klt
place. When (X, B) is sub-lc, a non-klt centre is also called a lc centre.

2.4. Fano pairs. Let (X, B) be a pair and X → Z a contraction. We say (X, B) is log
Fano over Z if it is lc and −(KX + B) is ample over Z; if B = 0 we just say X is Fano over
Z. The pair is called weak log Fano over Z if it is lc and −(KX + B) is nef and big over
Z; if B = 0 we say X is weak Fano over Z. We say X is Fano type over Z if (X, B) is klt
weak log Fano over Z for some choice of B; it is easy to see this is equivalent to existence
of a big/Z Q-boundary Γ so that (X, Γ) is klt and KX + Γ ∼Q 0/Z.

Assume X is Fano type over Z. Then we can run the MMP over Z on any R-Cartier
R-divisor D on X which ends with some model Y [6]. If DY is nef over Z, we call Y a
minimal model over Z for D, but if there is a DY -negative extremal contraction Y → T /Z
with dim Y > dim T , we call Y a Mori ﬁbre space over Z for D.

Lemma 2.5. Let (X, B) be a projective lc pair and X → Z a contraction onto a smooth
curve. Assume X is Fano type over some non-empty open set U ⊆ Z. Further assume B is
a Q-boundary, KX + B ∼Q 0/Z, and that the generic point of each non-klt centre of (X, B)
maps into U . Then X is Fano type over Z.

Proof. There is a big Q-boundary Γ such that over U we have: (X, Γ) is klt and KX + Γ ∼Q
0. Let (Y, BY ) be a Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B). There is a big Q-divisor ΓY with
coeﬃcients ≤ 1 such that its pushdown to X is Γ, and over U , KY + ΓY is the pullback of
KX + Γ. Replacing Γ with tΓ + (1 − t)B and replacing ΓY with tΓY + (1 − t)BY for some
suﬃciently small rational number t > 0, we can assume ΓY is a boundary. In particular, Y
is Fano type over U . Now replacing (X, B) with (Y, BY ) and replacing (X, Γ) with (Y, ΓY ),
we can assume X is Q-factorial.

Since (X, Γ) is klt over U and since the generic point of every non-klt centre of (X, B)
maps into U , replacing Γ with tΓ + (1 − t)B as above, we can assume (X, Γ) is klt, globally.
Running an MMP/Z on KX +Γ terminates with a minimal model X ′ on which KX ′ +Γ′ ∼Q
0/Z because Z is a curve. Let KX + Γ be the crepant pullback of KX ′ + Γ′. Then (X, Γ)
is sub-klt and KX + Γ ∼Q 0/Z. Note that each component of Γ with negative coeﬃcient
maps outside U . On the other hand, since the generic point of each non-klt centre of (X, B)
maps into U , adding to B a small multiple of the ﬁbre over each point in Z \ U , we can

8

assume Supp B contains the union of the support of all such ﬁbres. Thus replacing Γ with
tΓ + (1 − t)B again, we can assume Γ ≥ 0. Therefore, X is Fano type over Z.
(cid:3)

2.6. Generalised polarised pairs. For the basic theory of generalised polarised pairs see
[7, Section 4]. We recall some of the main notions.

(1) A generalised polarised pair consists of a normal variety X ′ equipped with projective
φ
→ X ′ → Z where φ is birational and X is normal, an R-divisor B′ ≥ 0, and
morphisms X
an R-Cartier divisor M on X which is nef/Z such that KX ′ + B′ + M ′ is R-Cartier, where
M ′ := φ∗M . We usually refer to the pair by saying (X ′, B′ + M ′) is a generalised pair with
φ
→ X ′ → Z and M . Note that if Y → X is a projective birational morphism from
data X
a normal variety, then there is no harm in replacing X with Y and replacing M with its
pullback to Y . On the other hand, when Z is not relevant we usually drop it and do not
mention it: in this case one can just assume X ′ → Z is the identity. When Z is a point we
also drop it but say the pair is projective.

Replacing X we can assume φ is a log resolution of (X ′, B′). We can write

KX + B + M = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)

for some uniquely determined B. For a prime divisor D on X the generalised log discrepancy
a(D, X ′, B′ + M ′) is 1 − µDB. A generalised non-klt centre is the image of a component of
B with coeﬃcient ≥ 1, and the generalised non-klt locus is the union of all the generalised
non-klt centres.

We say (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc (resp. generalised klt)(resp. generalised ǫ-lc) if
every coeﬃcient of B is ≤ 1 (resp. < 1)(resp. ≤ 1 − ǫ). We say (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised
dlt if (X ′, B′) is dlt and if every generalised non-klt centre of (X ′, B′ + M ′) is a non-klt
centre of (X ′, B′). If in addition the connected components of ⌊B′⌋ are irreducible, we say
the pair is generalised plt.

(2) Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a generalised pair as in (1) and let ψ : X ′′ → X ′ be a projective
birational morphism from a normal variety. Replacing φ we can assume φ factors through
ψ. We then let B′′ and M ′′ be the pushdowns of B and M on X ′′ respectively. In particular,

KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ = ψ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′).

If B′′ ≥ 0, then (X ′′, B′′ + M ′′) is also a generalised pair with data X → X ′′ → Z and M .
If (X ′′, B′′ + M ′′) is Q-factorial generalised dlt and if every exceptional prime divisor of ψ
appears in B′′ with coeﬃcients one, we then say (X ′′, B′′ + M ′′) is a Q-factorial generalised
dlt model of (X ′, B′ + M ′). Such models exist if (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc, by [7,
Remark 4.5 (1)].

(3) Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a generalised pair as in (1). Assume that D′ on X ′ is an eﬀective
R-divisor and that N on X is an R-divisor which is nef/Z such that D′ + N ′ is R-Cartier
where N ′ = φ∗N . The generalised lc threshold of D′ + N ′ with respect to (X ′, B′ + M ′) is
deﬁned as

sup{s | (X ′, B′ + sD′ + M ′ + sN ′) is generalised lc}

where the pair in the deﬁnition comes with data X

φ
→ X ′ → Z and M + sN .

(4) We prove a connectedness principle similar to the usual one.

Lemma 2.7 (Connectedness principle). Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a generalised pair with data
φ
→ X ′ → Z and M where X ′ → Z is a contraction. Assume −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef
X
and big over Z. Then the generalised non-klt locus of (X ′, B′ + M ′) is connected near each
ﬁbre of X ′ → Z.

Proof. We can assume φ is a log resolution. Write

KX + B + M = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′).

Let X ′′ be a minimal model of KX + M over X ′ which exists by [7, Lemma 4.4]. We write
KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ for the pushdown of KX + B + M . Then B′′ is anti-nef/X ′. Thus by the
negativity lemma, B′′ ≥ 0. The generalised non-klt locus of (X ′′, B′′ + M ′′) maps onto the
generalised non-klt locus of (X ′, B′ + M ′), hence replacing the latter pair with the former
we can assume X ′ is Q-factorial.

With the above notation, the generalised non-klt locus of (X ′, B′+M ′) is just φ(Supp B≥1).

We can write

−(KX + B + M ) ∼R A + C/Z

where A is ample and C ≥ 0. Replacing φ we can assume φ is a log resolution of (X ′, B′+C ′).
Pick a suﬃciently small ǫ > 0, let G ∼R M +ǫA/Z be general, and let ∆ = B+ǫC +G. Then
KX + ∆ ∼R 0/X ′, so KX + ∆ = φ∗(KX ′ + ∆′). Moreover, Supp B≥1 = Supp ∆≥1. Thus the
non-klt locus of the pair (X ′, ∆′) is equal to the generalised non-klt locus of (X ′, B′ + M ′).
Therefore, the result follows from the usual connected principle [28, Theorem 17.4] because

−(KX ′ + ∆′) ∼R −(1 − ǫ)(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)/Z

is nef and big over Z.

(cid:3)

(5) Let (X ′, B′+M ′) be a projective generalised klt pair. Assume A′ := −(KX ′ +B′+M ′)
is nef and big. We show X ′ is Fano type. Using the notation of (1), let A = φ∗A′. Then
A ∼R H + G where H is ample and G ≥ 0. Take a small ǫ > 0 and a general C ∼R ǫH + M .
Then

KX + B + ǫG + C ∼R KX + B + M + ǫA = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′ + ǫA′),

hence if we let ∆ = B + ǫG + C, then KX + ∆ = φ∗(KX ′ + ∆′) which shows (X ′, ∆′) is klt.
Since −(KX ′ + ∆′) is nef and big, X ′ is Fano type.

(6) Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised lc pair where X ′ is Fano type and
−(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef. Assume X ′′ → X ′ is a birational morphism from a normal
projective variety. Let KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ be the pullback of KX ′ + B′ + M ′ where B′′ is the
pushdown of B and M ′′ is the pushdown of M . We show X ′′ is Fano type too, assuming
every exceptional/X ′ component of B′′ has positive coeﬃcient. There is a Q-boundary Γ′
such that (X ′, Γ′) is klt and −(KX ′ + Γ′) is nef and big. Let KX ′′ + Γ′′ be the pullback
of KX ′ + Γ′. Let ∆′′ = (1 − t)Γ′′ + tB′′ for some t ∈ (0, 1) suﬃciently close to 1. Then
(X ′′, ∆′′ + tM ′′) is generalised klt and −(KX ′′ + ∆′′ + tM ′) is nef and big. Now apply (5).

2.8. Exceptional and non-exceptional pairs. (1) Let (X, B) be a projective pair such
that KX + B + P ∼R 0 for some R divisor P ≥ 0. We say the pair is non-exceptional (resp.
strongly non-exceptional) if we can choose P so that (X, B + P ) is not klt (resp. not lc).
We say the pair is exceptional if (X, B + P ) is klt for every choice of P .

(2) Now let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and
M . Assume KX ′ + B′ + M ′ + P ′ ∼R 0 for some R-divisor P ′ ≥ 0. We say the pair is non-
exceptional (resp. strongly non-exceptional) if we can choose P ′ so that (X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′)
is not generalised klt (resp. not generalised lc). We say the pair is exceptional if (X ′, B′ +
P ′ + M ′) is generalised klt for every choice of P ′. Here we consider (X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) as
a generalised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and M .

2.9. Complements. (1) We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition for usual pairs. Let (X, B) be a pair
where B is a boundary and let X → Z be a contraction. Let T = ⌊B⌋ and ∆ = B − T . An
n-complement of KX + B over a point z ∈ Z is of the form KX + B+ where

• (X, B+) is lc,
• n(KX + B+) ∼ 0 holds over some neighbourhood of z, and
• nB+ ≥ nT + ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ holds over some neighbourhood of z.

From the deﬁnition one sees that

−nKX − nT − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ ∼ nB+ − nT − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ ≥ 0

over some neighbourhood of z which in particular means the linear system

| − nKX − nT − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ |

is not empty over z.

(2) Now let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and M
where B′ ∈ [0, 1]. Let T ′ = ⌊B′⌋ and ∆′ = B′ − T ′. An n-complement of KX ′ + B′ + M ′ is
of the form KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ where
• (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is generalised lc,
• n(KX ′ + B′+ + M ′) ∼ 0 and nM is Cartier, and
• nB′+ ≥ nT ′ + ⌊(n + 1)∆′⌋.

From the deﬁnition one sees that

−nKX ′ − nT ′ − (cid:4)(n + 1)∆′(cid:5) − nM ′ ∼ nB′+ − nT ′ − (cid:4)(n + 1)∆′(cid:5) ≥ 0

which in particular means the linear system

| − nKX ′ − nT ′ − (cid:4)(n + 1)∆′(cid:5) − nM ′|

is not empty. We can also deﬁne complements for generalised pairs in the relative setting
but for simplicity we will not deal with those.

2.10. Bounded families of pairs. A couple (X, D) consists of a normal projective variety
X and a divisor D on X whose coeﬃcients are all equal to 1, i.e. D is a reduced divisor.
The reason we call (X, D) a couple rather than a pair is that we are concerned with D
rather than KX + D and we do not want to assume KX + D to be Q-Cartier or with nice
singularities.

We say that a set P of couples is birationally bounded if there exist ﬁnitely many pro-
jective morphisms V i → T i of varieties and reduced divisors C i on V i such that for each
(X, D) ∈ P there exist an i, a closed point t ∈ T i, and a birational isomorphism φ : V i
99K X
t
such that (V i
t are the ﬁbres over t of the
morphisms V i → T i and C i → T i respectively, and E is the sum of the birational transform
of D and the reduced exceptional divisor of φ. We say P is bounded if we can choose φ to
be an isomorphism.

t ) is a couple and E ≤ C i

t , C i

t where V i

t and C i

A set R of projective pairs (X, B) is said to be log birationally bounded (respectively
log bounded) if the set of the corresponding couples (X, Supp B) is birationally bounded
(respectively bounded). Note that this does not put any condition on the coeﬃcients of
B, eg we are not requiring the coeﬃcients of B to be in a ﬁnite set. If B = 0 for all the
(X, B) ∈ R we usually remove the log and just say the set is birationally bounded (resp.
bounded).

Lemma 2.11. Let P be a bounded set of couples and e ∈ R>0. Then there is a ﬁnite set
I ⊂ R depending only on P and e satisfying the following. Let (X, D) ∈ P and assume
R ≥ 0 is a non-zero integral divisor on X such that KX + D + rR ≡ 0 for some real number
r ≥ e. Then r ∈ I.

Proof. We can choose an eﬀective very ample Cartier divisor A on X such that (X, A + D)
belongs to a bounded set of couples Q depending only on P. Moreover, realising Ad−1 as a
1-cycle inside the smooth locus of X, the intersection number L · Ad−1 makes sense and is
an integer for any integral divisor L. On the other hand, by the boundedness assumption,
(KX + D) · Ad−1 belongs to some ﬁnite set depending only on P. Thus from

(KX + D + rR) · Ad−1 = 0

and the assumption r ≥ e we deduce that R · Ad−1 is bounded from above, hence r belongs
to some ﬁnite set I depending only on P and e.
(cid:3)

2.12. Families of subvarieties. Let X be a normal projective variety. A bounded family
G of subvarieties of X is a family of (closed) subvarieties such that there are ﬁnitely many
morphisms V i → T i of projective varieties together with morphisms V i → X such that
V i → X embeds in X the ﬁbres of V i → T i over closed points, and each member of the
family G is isomorphic to a ﬁbre of some V i → T i over some closed point. Note that we
can replace the V i → T i so that we can assume the set of points of T i corresponding to
members of G is dense in T i. We say the family G is a covering family of subvarieties of X
if the union of its members contains some non-empty open subset of X. In particular, this
means V i → X is surjective for at least one i. When we say G is a general member of G
we mean there is i such that V i → X is surjective, the set A of points of T i corresponding
to members of G is dense in T i, and G is the ﬁbre of V i → T i over a general point of A (in
particular, G is among the general ﬁbres of V i → T i).

Note that our deﬁnition of a bounded family here is compatible with 2.10. Indeed assume
G is a family of subvarieties of X which is bounded according to the deﬁnition in 2.10. Then
there are ﬁnitely many possible Hilbert polynomials (with respect to a ﬁxed ample divisor
on X) of the members of the family. Consider the Hilbert scheme H of X and take the
universal family H → H. There are closed subvarieties T i of H and irreducible components
V i of the reduction of V i, where V i = T i ×H H → T i is the induced family, so that each
G ∈ G is isomorphic to a ﬁbre of V i → T i over some closed point. By choosing the T i
carefully, we can assume that, for each i, the members of G correspond to a dense set of
ﬁbres of V i → T i. Since we obtained V i → T i from the Hilbert scheme, we have an induced
morphism V i → X which embeds in X the ﬁbres of V i → T i over closed points. Therefore,
G is a bounded family of subvarieties according to the deﬁnition in the last paragraph.

The next lemma is useful in applications when we want to replace V i → T i so that

V i → X becomes generically ﬁnite (eg, see the proof of 3.11).

Lemma 2.13. Let f : V → T be a contraction between smooth projective varieties and
g : V → X a surjective morphism to a normal projective variety. Let t be a closed point of
T and F the ﬁbre of f over t. Further assume

(1) the induced map F → X is birational onto its image,
(2) f is smooth over t,
(3) g is smooth over g(ηF ), and g(ηF ) is a smooth point of X where ηF is the generic

point of F .

Let S be a general hypersurface section of suﬃciently large degree passing through t, let
U = f ∗S, and assume U → X is surjective. Then U and S are smooth, U → S is smooth
over t, and U → X is smooth over g(ηF ).

Proof. Let v be a general closed point of F , and let G be the ﬁbre of g over x := g(v). The
scheme-theoretic intersection F ∩ G is the ﬁbre of F → X over x, hence it is the reduced
point {v}, by (1). In particular, TF,v ∩ TG,v = {v} where TF,v and TG,v are the tangent
spaces to F and G at v. On the other hand, F ∩ G is also the ﬁbre of the induced morphism
G → T over t, so the ﬁbre is again just {v}. Now since f is smooth over t, we have an
exact sequence of tangent spaces

0 → TF,v → TV,v → TT,t → 0.

Thus the kernel of the map TG,v → TT,t is TF,v ∩ TG,v, hence TG,v → TT,t is injective.
Therefore, G → T is a closed immersion near v, by Lemma 2.14 below.

Since S is a general hypersurface section of suﬃciently large degree passing through t and
since T is smooth, S is smooth too. Moreover, since G is smooth by (3), S|G is smooth as
well: indeed S|G is smooth outside v by [17, Chapter III, Remark 10.9.2] and also smooth
at v as G is smooth and G → T is a closed immersion near v.

By construction, U → S is smooth over t, and U is a smooth variety outside F . Moreover,
U is smooth at every point of F as F is the ﬁbre of U → S over t which is smooth and
t ∈ S is smooth. Therefore, U is smooth.

Since g is smooth near G, dim G = dim V − dim X. So

dim U ∩ G = dim G − 1 = dim V − dim X − 1 = dim U − dim X

where we think of the scheme-theoretic intersection U ∩ G as the ﬁbre of U → X over
x. Thus U → X is ﬂat over x by [17, Chapter III, Exercise 10.9] which in turn implies
U → X is smooth over x [17, Chapter III, Exercise 10.2] as U ∩ G = U |G = S|G is smooth.
Therefore, U → X is smooth over g(ηF ).

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.14. Let h : X → Z be a projective morphism of normal varieties, x ∈ X be a
closed point, and z = h(x). Assume h−1{z} = {x}, and assume the map on tangent spaces
TX,x → TZ,z is injective. Then h is a closed immersion near x.

Proof. Since h−1{z} = {x}, by considering the Stein factorisation of h, we can see that
h is a ﬁnite morphism over z. Thus shrinking X, Z we can assume h is ﬁnite. Using
h−1{z} = {x} once more, we deduce that every open neighbourhood of x in X contains
the inverse image under h of some open neighbourhood of z in Z. This implies the map on
stalks (h∗OX )z → OX,x is an isomorphism. Thus OX,x is a ﬁnitely generated OZ,z-module
as h∗OX is coherent.

On the other hand, since the map TX,x → TZ,z is injective, the dual map mz/m2

z →
mx/m2
x is surjective where mz and mx are the maximal ideals of OZ,z and OX,x. Now
apply [17, II, Lemma 7.4] to show the homomorphism OZ,z → OX,x is surjective which
implies OZ → h∗OX is surjective near z. Therefore, h is a closed immersion near x since h
is ﬁnite.
(cid:3)

2.15. Potentially birational divisors. Let X be a normal projective variety, and let D
be a big Q-Cartier Q-divisor on X. We say that D is potentially birational [14, Deﬁnition
3.5.3] if for any pair x and y of general closed points of X, possibly switching x and y, we
can ﬁnd 0 ≤ ∆ ∼Q (1 − ǫ)D for some 0 < ǫ < 1 such that (X, ∆) is not klt at y but (X, ∆)
is lc at x and {x} is a non-klt centre.

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

13

If D is potentially birational, then |KX + ⌈D⌉| deﬁnes a birational map [15, Lemma

2.3.4].

2.16. Non-klt centres. (1) The next statement is a variant of [14, Lemma 3.2.3].

Lemma 2.17. Let (X, B) be a projective pair where B is a Q-boundary, and let D ≥ 0 be
a big Q-Cartier Q-divisor. Let x, y ∈ X be closed points, and assume (X, B) is klt near x,
(X, B + D) is lc near x with a unique non-klt centre G containing x, and (X, B + D) is not
lc near y. Then there exist rational numbers 0 ≤ t ≪ s ≤ 1 and a Q-divisor 0 ≤ D′ ∼Q D
such that (X, B + sD + tD′) is not lc near y but it is lc near x with a unique non-klt place
whose centre contains x, and the centre of this non-klt place is G.

Proof. Let φ : W → X be a log resolution. Then φ∗D ∼Q A + C where A ≥ 0 is ample
and general, and C ≥ 0. Let C ′ = φ∗C and D′ = φ∗(A + C). We can assume φ is a log
resolution of (X, B + D + D′). Write

KW + Γs,t = φ∗(KX + B + sD + tD′).

Let T be the sum of the components of jΓ≥0
1,0k whose image contains x. By assumption,
φ(S) = G for every component S of T . Now pick t > 0 suﬃciently small and let s be the
lc threshold of D with respect to (X, B + tD′) near x. Then s is suﬃciently close to 1.
Moreover, jΓ≥0
s,tk whose image contains x, is
a component of T . Now possibly after perturbing the coeﬃcients of C and replacing A, we
s,tk has only one component S such that x ∈ φ(S). Since S is a component
can assume jΓ≥0
of T , we have φ(S) = G.

1,0k, so any component of jΓ≥0

(cid:3)

s,tk ⊆ jΓ≥0

1,tk = jΓ≥0

(2) Let X be a normal projective variety of dimension d and D an ample Q-divisor.
Assume vol(D) > (2d)d. Then there is a bounded family of subvarieties of X such that for
each pair x, y ∈ X of general closed points, there is a member G of the family and there
is 0 ≤ ∆ ∼Q D such that (X, ∆) is lc near x with a unique non-klt place whose centre
contains x, that centre is G, and (X, ∆) is not lc at y [14, Lemma 7.1].

Now assume A is an ample and eﬀective Q-divisor. Pick a pair x, y ∈ X of general closed
points and let ∆ and G be as above chosen for x, y. If dim G = 0, or if dim G > 0 and
vol(A|G) ≤ dd, then we let G′ := G and let ∆′ := ∆ + A. On the other hand, if dim G > 0
and vol(A|G) > dd, then there is 0 ≤ ∆′ ∼Q ∆ + A and there is a proper subvariety G′ ⊂ G
such that (X, ∆′) is lc near x with a unique non-klt place whose centre contains x, that
centre is G′, and (X, ∆′) is not lc at y, by [26, Theorem 6.8.1 and 6.8.1.3] and by Lemma
2.17. Repeating this process d − 1 times, we ﬁnd 0 ≤ ∆(d−1) ∼Q D + (d − 1)A and a
proper subvariety G(d−1) ⊂ G such that (X, ∆(d−1)) is lc near x with a unique non-klt
place whose centre contains x, that centre is G(d−1), (X, ∆(d−1)) is not lc at y, and either
dim G(d−1) = 0 or vol(A|G(d−1)) ≤ dd. In particular, all such centres G(d−1) form a bounded
family of subvarieties of X.

2.18. Numerical Kodaira dimension. For an R-divisor D on a normal projective variety
X, we denote the numerical Kodaira dimension of D by κσ(D), as deﬁned in [33]. If D is
pseudo-eﬀective, a decomposition D = Pσ(D) + Nσ(D) is deﬁned in [33] where Nσ(D) ≥ 0.

Lemma 2.19. Let P be a bounded set of smooth projective varieties X with κσ(KX ) = 0.
Then there is a number l ∈ N such that h0(lKX ) 6= 0 for every X ∈ P.

14

Caucher Birkar

Proof. Perhaps after replacing P, we can assume there is a smooth projective morphism
f : V → T of smooth varieties such that every X ∈ P appears as a ﬁbre of f over some
closed point. Then by [15, Theorem 1.8 (2)], κσ(KF ) = 0 for every ﬁbre F of f . Applying
[11] to the geometric generic ﬁbre and applying semi-continuity of cohomology shows that
there is l ∈ N such that h0(lKF ) 6= 0 for every ﬁbre F .
(cid:3)

2.20. Pseudo-eﬀective threshold.

Lemma 2.21. Let P be a log bounded set of log smooth projective pairs (X, B). Then there
is a number λ > 0 such that if (X, B) ∈ P and if KX is not pseudo-eﬀective, then KX + λB
is not pseudo-eﬀective.

Proof. Perhaps after replacing P, we can assume there exist a smooth projective morphism
f : V → T of smooth varieties and a reduced divisor S on V , which is simple normal crossing
over T , such that if (X, B) ∈ P, then X is a ﬁbre of f over some closed point and Supp B
is inside the restriction of S to X. Replacing B, we can assume B = S|X . Now apply [15,
Theorem 1.8 (2)].
(cid:3)

2.22. Volume of divisors. Recall that the volume of an R-divisor D on a normal projec-
tive variety X of dimension d is deﬁned as

vol(D) = lim sup
m→∞

h0(⌊mD⌋)

md/d!

.

Lemma 2.23. Let X be a normal projective variety of dimension d, D an R-Cartier R-
divisor with κσ(D) > 0, and A an ample Q-divisor. Then limm→∞ vol(mD + A) = ∞.

Proof. Replacing X with a resolution and replacing A appropriately, we can assume X is
smooth. Replacing D with Pσ(D), we can assume Nσ(D) = 0. Let C be a curve cut out by
general members of |A|. By [33, Chapter V, Theorem 1.3], perhaps after replacing A with a
multiple, we can assume C does not intersect Bs | ⌊mD⌋ + A| for any m > 0. In particular,
for each m, there is a resolution φ : W → X such that φ∗(⌊mD⌋ + A) decomposes as the
sum of a free divisor F and ﬁxed part G such that Supp G does not intersect φ−1C. Then

vol(mD + 2A) ≥ vol(⌊mD⌋ + 2A) = vol(φ∗(⌊mD⌋ + 2A)) ≥

vol(F + φ∗A)) ≥ F · (φ∗A)d−1 = φ∗(⌊mD⌋ + A) · (φ∗A)d−1 = (⌊mD⌋ + A) · C.

Since (⌊mD⌋ + A) · C is not a bounded function of m, vol(mD + 2A) is not bounded, hence
limm→∞ vol(2mD + 2A) = ∞ which implies the lemma.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.24. Let d ∈ N and let P be a set of pairs (X, A) where X is smooth projective of
dimension ≤ d with κσ(KX ) > 0, and A is big and base point free. Then for each number
q, there is a number p such that for every (X, A) ∈ P we have vol(pKX + A) > q.

Proof. If the statement is not true, then there exist a number q ∈ N, a strictly increasing
sequence of numbers pi ∈ N, and a sequence of pairs (Xi, Ai) ∈ P such that vol(piKXi +
Ai) ≤ q for every i. Since A is base point free, we may assume A is irreducible. Let Xi → Zi
be the contraction deﬁned by |Ai| and let Ci be the pushdown of Ai. Since vol(Ai) ≤ q, the
couples (Zi, Ci) form a log bounded family. Replacing Xi with an appropriate resolution
of Zi and replacing Ai accordingly, we can assume (Xi, Ai) is log smooth and log bounded.
Replacing the sequence, we can assume there is a projective morphism f : V → T of smooth
varieties and a reduced divisor A ≥ 0 on V which is simple normal crossing over T and
such that for each i, Xi appears as a general ﬁbre of f over some closed point and that
Ai = A|Xi.

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

Fix a general ﬁbre F of f and let AF = A|F . Then by [15, Theorem 1.8 (3)], for each i,

hence

vol(KF +

pi

AF ) = vol(KXi +

1

Ai),

vol(piKF + AF ) = vol(piKXi + Ai) ≤ q.

Pick l so that lAF ∼ HF +LF where HF is ample and LF is big. Then vol(lpiKF +HF ) ≤ ldq.
This contradicts Lemma 2.23.
(cid:3)

2.25. The restriction exact sequence. Let X be a normal projective variety, S a normal
prime divisor and L an integral Q-Cartier divisor on X. We have an exact sequence

where F is an OS-module.

0 → OX (L − S) → OX (L) → F → 0

Lemma 2.26. Assume (X, B) is dlt for some boundary B. Let U be the largest open subset
of X on which L is Cartier. If the codimension of the complement of S ∩ U in S is at least
two, then F ≃ OS(L|S).

Proof. Note that L|S is well-deﬁned up to linear equivalence. Let A be an ample Cartier
divisor on X. Since (X, B) is dlt, by duality [31, Corollary 5.27] and Serre vanishing,
hi(L − nA) = 0 and hi(L − S − nA) = 0 for any i < d = dim X and any n ≫ 0. Thus
hi(F(−nA)) = 0 for i < d − 1 and any n ≫ 0. This implies F is a Cohen-Macaulay sheaf
on S [31, Corollary 5.72]. In particular, F is S2, hence F is determined by F|U ∩S. On the
other hand, OS(L|S) is reﬂexive, hence it is determined by its restriction to S ∩ U . Now
the result follows from the fact that on S ∩ U , F and OS(L|S) are isomorphic.
(cid:3)

2.27. Descent of nef divisors.

Lemma 2.28. Let f : X → Z be a contraction from a smooth projective variety to a normal
projective variety with rationally connected general ﬁbres. Assume M is a nef Cartier
divisor on X such that M ∼Q 0 on the generic ﬁbre of f . Then there exist resolutions
φ : W → X and ψ : V → Z such that the induced map W 99K V is a morphism and
φ∗M ∼ 0/V .

Proof. Since M is nef and M ∼Q 0 on the generic ﬁbre of f , we can ﬁnd φ and ψ so that
φ∗M ∼Q 0/V [25, Proposition 2.1]. Replacing X with W and replacing Z with V , we
can assume M ∼Q 0/Z. Since the general ﬁbres of f are rationally connected, KX is not
pseudo-eﬀective over Z. Running an MMP/Z on KX with scaling of some ample divisor
as in [6], we get a Mori ﬁbre space X ′ → T ′/Z. Since M is Cartier and M ∼Q 0/Z, M ′ is
Cartier, by the cone theorem [31, Theorem 3.7], where M ′ is the pushdown of M . Moreover,
M ′ ∼ 0/T ′ again by [31, Theorem 3.7], hence M ′ is the pullback of some nef Cartier divisor
N ′ on T ′. Let T be a resolution of T ′. Then the general ﬁbres of T → Z are rationally
connected as they are dominated by the general ﬁbres of f . Now replace X with T and
replace M with the pullback of N ′ to T . Then apply induction on dimension.

(cid:3)

2.29. Pairs with large boundaries.

Lemma 2.30. Let (X, B) be a projective klt pair of dimension d, and let M be a nef Cartier
divisor. Let a > 2d be a real number. Then any MMP on KX + B + aM is M -trivial, i.e.
the extremal rays in the process intersect M trivially. If M is big, then KX + B + aM is
also big.

Caucher Birkar

Proof. The fact that any MMP on KX + B + aM is M -trivial follows from boundedness
of extremal rays [23]. The Cartier condition of M is preserved in the process by the cone
theorem. Now assume M is big. Then we can run an MMP which terminates with some
model [6]. Since M is big, the MMP ends with a minimal model otherwise we get a
Mori ﬁbre space Y → T and by boundedness of extremal rays, MY ≡ 0/T which is not
possible. Replacing X with the minimal model, we can assume KX + B + aM is nef. Then
KX + B + a′M is nef for any a′ < a suﬃciently close to a otherwise there is an extremal
ray R such that (KX + B + aM ) · R = 0 and M · R > 0 which contradicts boundedness of
extremal rays. Therefore, KX + B + aM is big.

2.31. Divisors with log discrepancy close to 0.

Lemma 2.32. Let d ∈ N and Φ ⊂ [0, 1] be a DCC set. Then there is ǫ > 0 depending only
on d and Φ such that if (X, B) is a projective pair and D is a prime divisor on birational
models of X satisfying

• (X, B) is lc of dimension d and (X, 0) is klt,
• KX + B ∼R 0 and B ∈ Φ, and
• a(D, X, B) < ǫ,

then a(D, X, B) = 0.

Proof. If the lemma does not hold, then there exist a decreasing sequence ǫi of numbers
approaching 0 and a sequence (Xi, Bi), Di of pairs and divisors as in the statement such
that 0 < a(Di, Xi, Bi) < ǫi. Since (Xi, 0) is klt, there is a birational morphism X ′
i → Xi
+ B′
i be the pullback of KXi + Bi, and let bi = 1 − a(Di, Xi, Bi)
extracting only Di. Let KX ′
which is the coeﬃcient of Di in B′
i. Note that B′
i ∈ Φ′ := Φ ∪ {bi}. Replacing the sequence,
we can assume Φ′ is a DCC set. Now we get a contradiction, by [14, Theorem 1.5], because
{bi} is not ﬁnite.

2.33. Boundary coeﬃcients close to 1. Let d, p ∈ N, ǫ ∈ R>0, and let Φ ⊂ [0, 1] be
a DCC set. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised pair of dimension d with data
φ : X → X ′ and M such that B′ ∈ Φ∪(1−ǫ, 1], pM is Cartier, −(KX ′ +B′+M ′) is a limit of
movable R-divisors, and there is 0 ≤ P ′ ∼R −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) such that (X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′)
is generalised lc. Assume X ′ is Q-factorial Fano type. Let Θ′ be the boundary whose
coeﬃcients are the same as B′ except that we replace each coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1) with 1.
That is, Θ′ = (B′)≤1−ǫ + ⌈(B′)>1−ǫ⌉.

Assuming ǫ is suﬃciently small, depending only on d, p, Φ, we will prove the following.

Run an MMP on −(KX ′ + Θ′ + M ′) and let X ′′ be the resulting model. Then:

(1) (X ′, Θ′ + M ′) is generalised lc,
(2) the MMP does not contract any component of ⌊Θ′⌋,
(3) −(KX ′′ + Θ′′ + M ′′) is nef, and
(4) (X ′′, Θ′′ + M ′′) is generalised lc.

3. Adjunction

In this section we discuss various kinds of adjunction that would be needed in subsequent

sections.

φ
3.1. Divisorial adjunction. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a generalised pair with data X
→ X ′
and M . Assume that S′ is the normalisation of a component of B′ with coeﬃcient 1, and
that S is its birational transform on X. Replacing X we may assume φ is a log resolution
of (X ′, B′). Write

and let

KX + B + M = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)

KS + BS + MS := (KX + B + M )|S

where BS = (B − S)|S and MS = M |S. Let ψ be the induced morphism S → S′ and let
BS ′ = ψ∗BS and MS ′ = ψ∗MS. Then we get the equality

KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′ = (KX ′ + B′ + M ′)|S ′

which we refer to as generalised (divisorial) adjunction. Note that
KS + BS + MS = ψ∗(KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′)

18

Caucher Birkar

It is obvious that BS ′ depends on both B′ and M . When M = 0, we recover the usual
divisorial adjunction.

By [7, Remark 4.7], if (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc, then BS ′ is a boundary divisor on
its coeﬃcients belong to [0, 1]. We consider (S′, BS ′ + MS ′) as a generalised pair
ψ
→ S′ and MS. It is also clear that (S′, BS ′ + MS ′) is generalised

S′, i.e.
which comes with data S
lc if (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc.

Lemma 3.2 (Generalised inversion of adjunction). Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a Q-factorial
φ
→ X ′ and M . Assume S′ is a component of B′ with coeﬃcient
generalised pair with data X
1, and that (X ′, S′) is plt. Let

KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′ = (KX ′ + B′ + M ′)|S ′

be given by generalised adjunction. If (S′, BS ′ + MS ′) is generalised lc, then (X ′, B′ + M ′)
is generalised lc near S′.

Proof. Assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is not generalised lc near S′. We can assume φ is a log
resolution. Write

KX + B + M = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′).

By assumption φ(B>1) intersects S′. Pick α ∈ (0, 1) suﬃciently close to 1, let Γ′ =
(1 − α)S′ + αB′, and write

KX + Γ + αM = φ∗(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′).

Then (X ′, Γ′ + αM ′) is not generalised lc near S′. On the other hand, since (X ′, S′) is plt
and (S′, BS ′ + MS ′) is generalised lc, (S′, ΓS ′ + αMS ′) is generalised klt where

KS ′ + ΓS ′ + αMS ′ = (KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′)|S ′

is generalised adjunction. Thus replacing B′ with Γ′ and M with αM , we can assume
(S′, BS ′ + MS ′) is generalised klt.

Pick an ample divisor A ≥ 0 and an eﬀective divisor C ≥ 0 such that A + C ∼ 0/X ′ and
that S is not a component of C. Let ǫ > 0 be small and pick a general 0 ≤ G ∼R ǫA+M/X ′.
Let ∆ := B +G+ǫC. Then KX +∆ ∼R 0/X ′, hence KX +∆ = φ∗(KX ′ +∆′). In particular,
(X ′, ∆′) is not lc near S′ as ∆ ≥ B. On the other hand, by assumption, (S, BS) is sub-klt
where KS + BS = (KX + B)|S. This implies (S, ∆S) is also sub-klt by construction of ∆
where KS + ∆S = (KX + ∆)|S. Therefore, letting KS ′ + ∆S ′ = (KX ′ + ∆′)|S ′ we see that
(S′, ∆S ′) is klt because KS + ∆S is the pullback of KS ′ + ∆S ′. This contradicts the usual
inversion of adjunction [21].

(cid:3)

The next result is similar to [34, Proposition 3.9].

Lemma 3.3. Let p ∈ N and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational numbers. Then there is a
ﬁnite set of rational numbers S ⊂ [0, 1] depending only on p and R satisfying the following.
φ
Assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is a generalised lc pair of dimension d with data X
→ X ′ → Z and
M , assume S′ is the normalisation of a component of ⌊B′⌋, and assume

• B′ ∈ Φ(R) and pM is Cartier, and
• BS ′ is given by the generalised adjunction

KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′ = (KX ′ + B′ + M ′)|S ′.

Then BS ′ ∈ Φ(S).

Proof. As in [7, Remark 4.8], by taking hypersurface sections, we can reduce the lemma to
the case dim X ′ = 2. Let V be a prime divisor on S′ and assume µV BS ′ < 1. Then as in
the proof of [7, Proposition 4.9], (X ′, B′) is plt near the image of the generic point of V
and the coeﬃcient of V in BS ′ is of the form

µV BS ′ = 1 −

that bi = 1 − ri

Now assume t = 1. Then either m1 ≤ 2, or m1 > 2 and α1 = 1, hence in any case s = s′

where there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for s′. Thus µV BS ′ = 1− s
m1l ∈ Φ(S)
if we choose S so that it contains all such s′. We can then assume t > 1. If mi = 1 for
every i, then there are ﬁnitely many possibilities for s = 1 − Pt
i=1(1 − ri)αi and we let
s′ = s. But if some mi > 1, say for simplicity m1 > 1, then α1 = 1 and mi = 1 for i > 1.

Then s = r1
for some s′ for which there

3.4. Adjunction for ﬁbre spaces. (1) Let (X, B) be a projective sub-pair and let f : X →
Z be a contraction with dim Z > 0 such that (X, B) is sub-lc near the generic ﬁbre of f , and
KX + B ∼R 0/Z. Below we recall a construction based on [22] giving a kind of canonical
bundle formula which we refer to as adjunction for ﬁbre spaces [1][34, §7].

For each prime divisor D on Z we let tD be the lc threshold of f ∗D with respect to (X, B)
over the generic point of D, that is, tD is the largest number so that (X, B + tDf ∗D) is
sub-lc over the generic point of D. Of course f ∗D may not be well-deﬁned everywhere but
at least it is deﬁned over the smooth locus of Z, in particular, near the generic point of
D, and that is all we need. Next let bD = 1 − tD, and then deﬁne BZ = P bDD where
the sum runs over all the prime divisors on Z. By assumption, KX + B ∼R f ∗LZ for some
R-Cartier R-divisor LZ on Z. Letting MZ = LZ − (KZ + BZ ) we get

KX + B ∼R f ∗(KZ + BZ + MZ ).

We call BZ the discriminant part and MZ the moduli part of adjunction. Obviously BZ
is uniquely determined but MZ depends on the choice of LZ. However, MZ is determined
uniquely up to R-linear equivalence.

Now let φ : X ′ → X and ψ : Z ′ → Z be birational morphisms from normal projective
varieties and assume the induced map f ′ : X ′ 99K Z ′ is a morphism. Let KX ′+B′ = φ∗(KX +
B). Similar to above we can deﬁne a discriminant divisor BZ ′, and taking LZ ′ = ψ∗LZ
gives a moduli divisor MZ ′ so that

and BZ = ψ∗BZ ′ and MZ = ψ∗MZ ′.

KX ′ + B′ ∼R f ′∗(KZ ′ + BZ ′ + MZ ′)

20

Caucher Birkar

(2) We want to show MZ depends only on (X, B) near the generic ﬁbre of f , even
birationally. We make this more precise. In addition to the assumptions of (1), suppose we
are given another projective sub-pair (X, B) and a contraction X → Z such that KX +B ∼R
0/Z. Moreover, suppose we have a birational map X 99K X/Z, and suppose there is a
common resolution of X and X on which the pullback of KX + B and KX + B are equal
near the generic ﬁbre over Z. Let BZ ′ and M Z ′ be the discriminant and moduli parts of
adjunction on Z ′ deﬁned for (X, B) and the contraction X → Z.

Lemma 3.5. Under the above notation and assumptions, MZ ′ ∼R M Z ′.
Proof. Replacing both X and X with a common resolution over Z ′, replacing KX + B and
KX + B with their crepant pullbacks, and replacing Z with Z ′ we can assume X = X,
Z ′ = Z, and that B = B near the generic ﬁbre. Then B − B is vertical over Z and
B − B ∼R 0/Z. So B − B = f ∗P for some P on Z. Therefore, by deﬁnition of the
discriminant part, BZ = BZ + P from which we get M Z ∼R MZ because

KZ + BZ + MZ + P ∼R KZ + BZ + M Z .

(cid:3)

(3) When (X, B) is lc over the generic point of Z we have:

Theorem 3.6. Under the notation and assumptions of (1), suppose (X, B) is lc near the
generic ﬁbre of f . Let Z ′ be a suﬃciently high resolution of Z. Then

(i) MZ ′ is pseudo-eﬀective, and
(ii) if B is a Q-divisor, then MZ ′ is nef and for any birational morphism Z ′′ → Z ′ from

a normal projective variety, MZ ′′ is the pullback of MZ ′.

Proof. Let Γ be the boundary divisor obtained from B by removing components that have
negative coeﬃcients or are vertical/Z. Note that over the generic point of Z we have Γ = B.
Let φ : W → X be a log resolution and let ΓW be the sum of the horizontal/Z part of the
reduced exceptional divisor of φ and the birational transform of Γ. We can choose W so
that every lc centre of (W, ΓW ) is horizontal/Z. Running an MMP on KW + ΓW over X
we reach a model X ′ so that (X ′, Γ′) is a Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B) over the generic
point of Z. Let KX ′ + B′ be the pullback of KX + B. Replacing (X, B) with (X ′, B′) and
replacing (X, Γ) with (X ′, Γ′) we can assume (X, Γ) is Q-factorial dlt with every lc centre
horizontal/Z, and that every component of Γ is horizontal/Z.

We prove (ii) ﬁrst. By [5, Theorem 1.4] we can replace X with a model on which KX + Γ
is semi-ample over Z, hence deﬁning a contraction X → Y /Z. Since KX + Γ ∼Q 0/Y ,
by Lemma 3.5, we can replace Z with Y and replace B with Γ, hence assume (X, B) is
Q-factorial dlt. The claim then follows from Fujino-Gongyo [10] (this relies on Ambro [2]
in the klt case).

Now we prove (i). By standard arguments we can ﬁnd Q-divisors Bi and numbers
αi ∈ [0, 1] with P αi = 1 such that B = P αiBi, (X, Bi) is lc over the generic point of
Z, and KX + Bi ∼Q 0/Z. Let Bi
Z ′ be the discriminant and moduli parts deﬁned
for (X, Bi) over Z. Let D be a prime divisor on Z and let ti be the lc threshold of f ∗D
with respect to (X, Bi) over the generic point of D. Then (X, B + (P αiti)f ∗D) is lc over
the generic point of D, hence t ≥ P αiti where t is the lc threshold of f ∗D with respect
to (X, B) over the generic point of D. Then 1 − t ≤ αi(1 − ti) from which we deduce
BZ ≤ P αiBi
Z ′ + P
for some P ≥ 0. Therefore, MZ ′ is pseudo-eﬀective as each M i

Z. Similarly we can prove BZ ′ ≤ P αiBi

Z ′ and M i

Z ′. This shows MZ ′ ∼R P αiM i

Z ′ is nef.

(cid:3)

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

(4) We relate the singularities of (X, B) and (Z, BZ + MZ) though in a rough sense.

Lemma 3.7. Let ǫ ∈ R. Under the notation and assumptions of (1), suppose there is
a prime divisor S on some birational model of X such that a(S, X, B) ≤ ǫ and that S
is vertical over Z. Then there is a resolution Z ′ → Z and a component T of BZ ′ with
coeﬃcient ≥ 1 − ǫ.

Proof. Pick resolutions X ′ → X and Z ′ → Z so that the induced map f ′ : X ′ 99K Z ′ is a
morphism and so that S is a prime divisor on X ′ and its image on Z ′ is a prime divisor T .
Let KX ′ + B′ be the pullback of KX + B. Since a(S, X, B) ≤ ǫ, the coeﬃcient of S in B′ is
at least 1 − ǫ. Thus the lc threshold of f ′∗T with respect to (X ′, B′) over the generic point
of T is at most ǫ. Therefore, the coeﬃcient of T in BZ ′ is at least 1 − ǫ.
(cid:3)

3.8. Adjunction on non-klt centres.

Theorem 3.9 ([14, Theorem 4.2]). Let Φ be a subset of [0, 1] which contains 1. Let X be a
projective variety of dimension d, and let G be a subvariety, with normalisation F . Suppose
we are given a boundary B and an R-Cartier divisor ∆ ≥ 0, with the following properties:

• (X, B) is klt and B ∈ Φ, and
• there is a unique non-klt place of (X, B + ∆) whose centre is G.

Then there is a boundary ΘF on F whose coeﬃcients belong to

such that

{a | 1 − a ∈ LCTd−1(D(Φ))} ∪ {1}

KF + ΘF + PF ∼R (KX + B + ∆)|F

where PF is pseudo-eﬀective.

Now suppose that G is a general member of a covering family of subvarieties of X. Let
ψ : F ′ → F be a log resolution of (F, ΘF ), and let ΘF ′ be the sum of the birational transform
of ΘF and the reduced exceptional divisor of ψ. Then

KF ′ + ΘF ′ ≥ (KX + B)|F ′.

In the theorem D(Φ) is a set associated to Φ with the property: D(Φ) is DCC iﬀ Φ is
DCC [14, 3.4]. The set LCTd−1(D(Φ)) stands for the set of all lc thresholds of integral
eﬀective divisors with respect to pairs (S, Γ) of dimension d − 1 such that Γ ∈ D(Φ).

In the proof of the next two lemmas we recall the construction of ΘF and PF and the

proof of 3.9 following [14] but with more details.

Lemma 3.10. Let (X, B), ∆, G, F, and ΘF , be as in Theorem 3.9 where G is not necessarily
a general member of a covering family. Let M ≥ 0 be a Q-Cartier Q-divisor on X with
coeﬃcients ≥ 1 and such that G * Supp M . Then for every component D of MF := M |F
we have µD(ΘF + MF ) ≥ 1.

Proof. Let Γ be the sum of (B + ∆)<1 and the support of (B + ∆)≥1. Put N = B + ∆ − Γ
which is supported in ⌊Γ⌋. Let φ : W → X be a log resolution and let ΓW be the sum of
the reduced exceptional divisor of φ and the birational transform of Γ. Let

NW = φ∗(KX + B + ∆) − (KW + ΓW ).

Then φ∗NW = N ≥ 0 and NW is supported in ⌊ΓW ⌋. Now run an MMP/X on KW + ΓW
with scaling of some ample divisor. We reach a model Y on which KY + ΓY is a limit
[5, Lemma 3.3]), we
of movable/X divisors. Applying the general negativity lemma (cf.
deduce NY ≥ 0. In particular, if U ⊆ X is the set of points where (X, B + ∆) is lc, then

22

Caucher Birkar

NY = 0 over U and (Y, ΓY ) is a Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B + ∆) over U . Since there
is a unique non-klt place of (X, B + ∆) with centre G, (X, B + ∆) is lc but not klt at the
generic point of G. In particular, we can assume there is a unique component S of ⌊ΓY ⌋
mapping onto G. Moreover, G ∩ U 6= ∅, so G is not inside the image of NY .

Let h : S → F be the contraction induced by S → G. By divisorial adjunction we can

write

KS + ΓS + NS = (KY + ΓY + NY )|S ∼R 0/F

where NS = NY |S is vertical over F . If S is exceptional over X, then let ΣY be the sum
of the exceptional/X divisors on Y plus the birational transform of B. Otherwise let ΣY
be the sum of the exceptional/X divisors on Y plus the birational transform of B plus
(1 − µGB)S. In any case, S is a component of ⌊ΣY ⌋ and ΣY ≤ ΓY . Applying adjunction
again we get KS + ΣS = (KY + ΣY )|S. Obviously ΣS ≤ ΓS.

Now ΘF is deﬁned as follows. For each prime divisor D on F , let t be the lc threshold of
h∗D with respect to (S, ΣS) over the generic point of D, and then let µDΘF := 1 − t [14,
proof of Theorem 4.2]. One then chooses PF to satisfy

KS + ΓS + NS ∼R h∗(KF + ΘF + PF ).

Let ∆F and RF be the discriminant and the moduli parts of adjunction for (S, ΓS + NS)
over F . Since ΣS ≤ ΓS + NS, we have ΘF ≤ ∆F , hence PF − RF ∼R ∆F − ΘF ≥ 0. By
Theorem 3.6, RF is pseudo-eﬀective which implies PF is pseudo-eﬀective too.

Y := ΣY + MY and Σ′

Let Σ′
S = ΣS + MS where MY = M |Y and MS = MY |S. We deﬁne
F similar to ΘF . That is, for each prime divisor D on F , let t′ be the lc threshold of
F := 1 − t′. It
F = ΘF + MF . On the other hand, since the

Θ′
h∗D with respect to (S, Σ′
is easy to see t′ + µDMF = t. This means Θ′
coeﬃcients of M are at least 1 and since S is not a component of MY ,
Y − S(cid:5) .

Supp MY ⊆ Supp ⌊ΣY + MY − S⌋ = Supp(cid:4)Σ′

S) over the generic point of D, and then let µDΘ′

Therefore, Supp MS ⊂ ⌊Σ′

Lemma 3.11. Let (X, B), ∆, G, F, and ΘF be as in Theorem 3.9 where G is a general
member of a covering family of subvarieties. Assume (X, B) is ǫ-lc for some ǫ > 0. Then
there is a sub-boundary BF on F such that KF +BF = (KX +B)|F , that (F, BF ) is sub-ǫ-lc,
and BF ≤ ΘF .
Proof. Step 1. There is a contraction ˜f : ˜V → ˜T of normal projective varieties such that
G is isomorphic to a general ﬁbre of ˜f , and there is a surjective morphism ˜V → X whose
restriction to each ﬁbre of ˜f over a closed point is a closed immersion (see 2.12). In par-
ticular, identifying G with the ﬁbre mentioned, the induced morphism G → X maps G
onto itself. Taking normalisations of ˜V and ˜T , we get a contraction f : V → T of normal
projective varieties such that the ﬁbre of f corresponding to G is just F the normalisation
of G. Taking resolutions of V and T we get a contraction f ′ : V ′ → T ′ of smooth projective
varieties. Letting F ′ be the ﬁbre of f ′ corresponding to F , we see that the induced mor-
phism F ′ → X is birational onto its image. Moreover, we can assume there is a Cartier
divisor P ≥ 0 on X whose support contains Supp B and the singular locus of X and such
that Q′ := Supp g′∗P is relatively simple normal crossing over some open subset of T ′ where

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

23

g′ is the induced map V ′ → X.

Step 2. Fixing G, by construction, f ′ is smooth over t′ = f ′(F ′), g′ is smooth over
g′(ηF ′), and g′(ηF ′) is smooth on X. If g′ is generically ﬁnite let W ′ := V ′ and R′ := T ′. If
not, applying Lemma 2.13, there is a general smooth hypersurface section H ′ of T ′ passing
through t′ so that if U ′ = f ′∗H ′, then U ′ and H ′ are smooth, U ′ → H ′ is smooth over
t′, and U ′ → X is surjective and smooth over g′(ηF ′). Repeating this we get a smooth
subvariety R′ of T ′ passing through t′ so that the induced family W ′ → R′ is smooth
over t′, W ′ is smooth, W ′ → X is surjective and generically ﬁnite and ´etale over g′(ηF ′).
Let QW ′ = Q′|W ′. Then by construction, QW ′|F ′ = Q′|F ′ is reduced and simple normal
crossing. Therefore, near F ′ the divisor QW ′ is reduced and any prime divisor C ′ on F ′ is
contained in at most one component of QW ′.

Step 3. Let KW ′ + BW ′ be the pullback of KX + B to W ′. Here KW ′ and BW ′ are
uniquely determined as Weil divisors (we assume we have already ﬁxed a choice of KX ).
Let W ′ → W → X be the Stein factorisation of W ′ → X. By the Riemann-Hurwitz for-
mula, each coeﬃcient of BW is ≤ 1 − ǫ where KW + BW is the pullback of KX + B. Thus
(W, BW ) is sub-ǫ-lc by [31, Proposition 5.20], hence (W ′, BW ′) is also sub-ǫ-lc. On the other
hand, by our choice of P , any component of BW ′ with positive coeﬃcient is mapped into
P , hence it is a component of QW ′. Moreover, since G was chosen general, it is not inside
Supp KX ∪ Supp P . Thus since W ′ → X is ´etale over g′(ηF ′), F ′ is not inside Supp BW ′
nor inside Supp KW ′. Deﬁning BF ′ = BW ′|F ′ we get KF ′ + BF ′ = (KW ′ + BW ′)|F ′ where
KF ′ = KW ′|F ′ follows from the fact that W ′ → R′ is smooth near F ′ (note that KF ′ is
determined as a Weil divisor). Let KF + BF be the pushdown of KF ′ + BF ′ which satisﬁes
KF + BF = (KX + B)|F .

Step 4. To show (F, BF ) is sub-ǫ-lc, it is enough to show (F ′, BF ′) is sub-ǫ-lc. This in
W ′ and AF ′ = AW ′|F ′. By the last

turn follows if show (F ′, AF ′) is ǫ-lc where AW ′ := B≥0
paragraph, Supp AW ′ ⊆ Supp QW ′, hence

Supp AF ′ = Supp AW ′|F ′ ⊆ Supp QW ′|F ′ = Supp Q′|F ′.

So Supp AF ′ is simple normal crossing as Supp Q′|F ′ is simple normal crossing. Therefore,
it is enough to show each coeﬃcient of AF ′ is ≤ 1 − ǫ. Let C ′ be a component of AF ′ with
positive coeﬃcient. Then there is a component D′ of AW ′ with positive coeﬃcient so that C ′
is a component of D′|F ′. Since D′ is a component of QW ′, by the second paragraph of this
proof, D′ is uniquely determined and D′|F ′ is reduced. Then µD′BW ′ = µD′AW ′ = µC ′AF ′.
But µD′BW ′ ≤ 1 − ǫ because (W ′, BW ′) is sub-ǫ-lc, hence µC ′AF ′ ≤ 1 − ǫ.

Step 5. It remains to show BF ≤ ΘF . Assume C is a prime divisor on F with µCBF > 0.
Let C ′ on F ′ be the birational transform of C. Then µC ′BF ′ > 0. Thus there is a unique
component D′ of B>0
W ′ with positive coeﬃcient such that C ′ is a component of D′|F ′. In
particular, µC ′BF ′ ≤ µD′BW ′ as D′|F ′ is reduced. Let L = cP and let LW ′ = L|W ′ and
LF ′ = L|F ′ where c is a number. Choose c so that µD′LW ′ = 1. Then µC ′LF ′ = µD′LW ′ =
1.

We use the notation of the proof of Lemma 3.10. Recall that we constructed a birational
morphism Y → X which we denote by π, a boundary ΣY , and a component S of ⌊ΣY ⌋
mapping onto G. Let LS = L|S and let t be the lc threshold of LS with respect to (S, ΣS)
over the generic point ηC of C. By construction, µC(L|F ) = µC ′LF ′ = 1, so under h : S → F
the divisor LS is equal to h∗C over ηC. Therefore, µCΘF = 1 − t.

Let s be the lc threshold of L with respect to (X, B) near ν(ηC ) where ν denotes F → G.
Let I be the minimal non-klt centre of (X, B +sL) which contains ν(ηC). Since G * Supp L,
G * I. Let LY = π∗L and write KY + BY = π∗(KX + B). Let IY be a non-klt centre
of (Y, BY + sLY ) which maps onto I. Since ΣY ≥ BY , IY is also a non-klt centre of
(Y, ΣY + sLY ). Note that IY 6= S.

Step 6. In this step we assume X is Q-factorial. We will show t ≤ s. This follows if we
show that some non-klt centre of (S, ΣS + sLS) maps onto C. Let Π be the ﬁbre of π over
a general closed point of ν(C) and let H be the corresponding ﬁbre of S → G. Then Π is
connected, and since X is Q-factorial, Π is inside the union of the exceptional divisors of
π, hence Π ⊂ ⌊ΣY ⌋. Moreover, IY intersects Π.

Let E be the connected component of H which maps into C under S → F . If a component
R of ⌊ΣY ⌋ − S intersects E, then R ∩ S gives a non-klt centre of (S, ΣS + sLS) mapping
onto C (note that (⌊ΣY ⌋ − S) ∩ S is vertical over F ). Assume there is no such R. Then
E = H = Π otherwise since Π is connected, there is a connected chain of curves Z1, . . . , Zr
in Π such that Zi * E, Z1 intersects E, and the chain connects E to some point in Π \ E:
this is not possible because Z1 cannot be inside ⌊ΣY ⌋ − S, so it is inside S, hence it is
inside E as it intersects E, a contradiction. Therefore, IY intersects E, so by inversion of
adjunction IY ∩ S produces a non-klt centre of (S, ΣS + sLS) intersecting E, and the centre
maps onto C as required. Thus we have proved t ≤ s.

Now since (X, B + sL) is lc near ν(ηC), (W ′, BW ′ + sLW ′) is sub-lc over ν(ηC ) which

implies

where D′ is as in Step 5. Therefore,

µD′BW ′ + s = µD′(BW ′ + sLW ′) ≤ 1

µCBF + t ≤ µC ′BF ′ + s ≤ µD′BW ′ + s ≤ 1

which in turn gives µCBF ≤ 1 − t = µCΘF .

Step 7. Finally assume X is not Q-factorial and let X → X be a small Q-factorialisation.
Let B, ∆, G, etc, be the birational transforms of B, ∆, G, etc. We can assume Y → X and
W ′ → X both factor through X → X. Let F be the normalisation of G. Then we have
induced morphisms S → F → F , and we can deﬁne ΘF whose pushdown to F is just ΘF .
Also we can write KF + BF = (KX + B)|F where the pushdown of BF is just BF . Thus it
is enough to show BF ≤ ΘF . Now apply the arguments of Step 6 on X.

3.12. Lifting sections from non-klt centres. We now show that under suitable assump-
tions we can lift sections from a lc centre. This is a key ingredient of the proof of 4.7 in
next section.

Proposition 3.13. Let d, r ∈ N and ǫ ∈ R>0. Then there is l ∈ N depending only on d, r, ǫ
satisfying the following. Let (X, B), ∆, G, F, ΘF , and PF be as in Theorem 3.9 where G is
a general member of a covering family of subvarieties. Assume in addition that

• X is Fano of dimension d, and B = 0,
• ∆ ∼Q −(n + 1)KX for some n ∈ N,
• h0(−rnKX|F ) 6= 0, and
• PF is big and for any choice of PF ≥ 0 in its Q-linear equivalence class the pair

(F, ΘF + PF ) is ǫ-lc.

Then h0(−lnrKX) 6= 0.

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

25

Proof. Step 1. We will use the notation of the proof of Lemma 3.10. First note that
since B = 0 and ∆ is a Q-divisor, ΘF is a Q-boundary, so we can assume PF is a Q-
divisor. Remember that (X, ∆) is lc near the generic point of G. We will show that
under our assumptions G is actually an isolated non-klt centre of (X, ∆). Recall that
⌊ΓY ⌋ has a unique component S mapping onto G. Letting ∆Y = ΓY + NY we have
KY + ∆Y = π∗(KX + ∆) where π denotes Y → X. Let KS + ∆S = (KY + ∆Y )|S . Applying
adjunction for ﬁbre spaces we get

KS + ∆S ∼Q f ∗(KF + ∆F + RF )

where ∆F is the discriminant part and RF is the moduli part. Note that ∆F + RF ∼Q
ΘF + PF .

Assume G is not an isolated non-klt centre. Then some non-klt centre Z 6= S of (Y, ∆Y )
intersects S by the connectedness principle, hence some component of ⌊∆Y − S⌋ intersects
S as the non-klt locus of (Y, ∆Y ) is equal to ⌊∆Y ⌋. This in turn gives a component of
⌊∆S⌋ which is vertical over F as there is a unique non-klt place of (Y, ∆Y ) with centre G.
Applying Lemma 3.7, there is a high resolution F ′ → F so that some component T of ∆F ′
has coeﬃcient at least 1.

Step 2. Pick a suﬃciently small rational number t > 0. Since PF is big, we can assume
PF = AF + CF where AF is ample and CF ≥ 0 both being Q-divisors. Let ΩF = ΘF + CF
and let KF ′ +ΩF ′ be the pullback of KF +ΩF . Then the coeﬃcient of T in tΩF ′ +(1−t)∆F ′
is more than 1 − ǫ. As RF ′ is nef (3.6), we can ﬁnd

0 ≤ JF ′ ∼Q tAF ′ + (1 − t)RF ′

where AF ′ is the pullback of AF . Therefore,

(F ′, tΩF ′ + (1 − t)∆F ′ + JF ′)

is not sub-ǫ-lc. Moreover, as KF ′ + ∆F ′ + RF ′ is the pullback of KF + ∆F + RF and as
KF ′ + ΩF ′ + AF ′ is the pullback of KF + ΩF + AF , we see that

is Q-linearly trivial over F , hence it is the pullback of

KF ′ + tΩF ′ + (1 − t)∆F ′ + JF ′

KF + tΩF + (1 − t)∆F + JF

where JF is the pushdown of JF ′. Therefore,

(F, tΩF + (1 − t)∆F + JF )

is not ǫ-lc.

On the other hand, we have

tΩF + (1 − t)∆F + JF ∼Q tΘF + tCF + (1 − t)∆F + tAF + (1 − t)RF

= tΘF + tPF + (1 − t)∆F + (1 − t)RF ∼Q ΘF + PF .

Moreover, by construction, ∆F ≥ ΘF , hence

tΩF + (1 − t)∆F ≥ tΘF + (1 − t)∆F ≥ ΘF .

This is a contradiction. So we have proved that G is an isolated non-klt centre of (X, ∆)
and that (Y, ∆Y ) is plt near S.

Step 3. Let E = π∗(−rnKX). Then E is integral near S because KX is Cartier near the
generic point of G and because S does not intersect any exceptional divisor of π except S
itself. Let V be a prime divisor on S. If V is horizontal over G, then E is Cartier near the

26

Caucher Birkar

generic point of V . Assume V is vertical over G. We want to show the Cartier index of
E near the generic point of V is bounded. Let p be the Cartier index of KY + S near the
generic point of V . Then µV ∆S ≥ 1 − 1
p and the Cartier index of E near the generic point
of V divides p [38, Proposition 3.9]. Therefore, 1
p ≥ ǫ otherwise we can apply Lemma 3.7
and apply arguments similar to step 1 to choose PF so that (F, ΘF + PF ) is not ǫ-lc which
would give a contradiction. This means that p is bounded depending only on ǫ, hence the
Cartier index of E near the generic point of V is also bounded.

Step 4. Using the notation of the proof of 3.10, ∆Y = ΓY + NY . Pick 2 ≤ l ∈ N and

deﬁne L by the relation

By construction, NY + L is supported in ⌊ΓY ⌋ − S which is disjoint from S by Step 2. As

⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY ⌉ = lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY + L.

KY + ∆Y = π∗(KX + ∆) ∼Q −nπ∗KX
the Q-divisor I = lE − (KY + ∆Y ) is nef and big. We can write

⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY ⌉ = lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY + L

∼Q KY + ∆Y + I − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY + L = KY + ΓY − ⌊ΓY ⌋ + L + I.

Since (Y, ΓY − ⌊ΓY ⌋ + L) is klt, by Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing

h1(⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY ⌉) = 0.

By the previous step, we can choose a bounded l as above such that if U is the largest
open set on which ⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ + S − NY ⌉ is Cartier, then the codimension of S \ (S ∩ U )
in S is at least 2 where we use the fact that ⌊ΓY ⌋ − S + NY does not intersect S and that
E is integral near S. Thus by Lemma 2.26, we have the exact sequence

0 → OY (⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ − NY ⌉) → OY (⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ + S − NY ⌉) → OS(⌈lE⌉|S ) → 0.

Now

⌈lE⌉|S = lE|S = f ∗(−lnrKX|F )

and by assumption, h0(−lnrKX|F ) 6= 0, hence h0(⌈lE⌉|S ) 6= 0. Therefore,

hence h0(⌈lE⌉) 6= 0 which implies h0(−lnrKX) 6= 0.

h0(⌈lE − ⌊ΓY ⌋ + S − NY ⌉) 6= 0

4. Eﬀective birationality

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2 under certain extra assumptions. These special

cases are crucial for the proof of all the main results of this paper.

4.1. Singularities in bounded families.
Proposition 4.2. Let ǫ ∈ R>0 and let P be a bounded set of couples. Then there is δ ∈ R>0
depending only on ǫ, P satisfying the following. Let (X, B) be a projective pair and let T be
a reduced divisor on X. Assume

• (X, B) is ǫ-lc and (X, Supp B + T ) ∈ P,
• L ≥ 0 is an R-Cartier R-divisor on X,
• L ∼R N for some R-divisor N supported in T , and
• the absolute value of each coeﬃcient of N is at most δ.

Then (X, B + L) is klt.

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

27

Proof. We may assume all the members of P have the same dimension, say d. We prove
the proposition by induction on d. Let (X, B), T, L, N be as in the statement for some δ,
and assume (X, B + L) is not klt. First assume d = 1. Then deg L ≥ ǫ, hence deg N ≥ ǫ.
This is not possible if δ is small enough because deg N ≤ δ deg T and deg T is bounded. So
we can assume d ≥ 2.

We can ﬁnd a log resolution φ : W → X of (X, B + T ) such that if we write

KW + BW = φ∗(KX + B) + E

where BW ≥ 0 and E ≥ 0 have no common components, and let TW be the sum of
the birational transform of T and the reduced exceptional divisor φ, then (W, BW ) is ǫ-
lc and (W, Supp BW + TW ) belongs to a bounded set of couples depending only on P.
Let LW = φ∗L and NW = φ∗N . Then there is m ∈ N depending only on P so that
the absolute value of each coeﬃcient of NW is ≤ mδ. Therefore, we can replace P and
replace (X, B), T, L, N, δ with (W, BW ), TW , LW , NW , mδ, hence assume from now on that
(X, Supp B + T ) is log smooth. Moreover, we may replace T so that B and T have no
common components and T is very ample.

Now assume δ is suﬃciently small. Let D be a prime divisor on birational models of X
such that a(D, X, B + L) ≤ 0. We show D is not a divisor on X. Since T is very ample and
T d is bounded, from T d−1 · L = T d−1 · N ≤ δT d we deduce if l is a coeﬃcient of L, then
l ≤ δT d. This shows that D cannot be a divisor on X as we can assume µD(B + L) < 1.
Therefore, D is exceptional/X.

Let V be the centre of D on X. First assume V is not inside Supp B. In this case we
can remove B and assume B = 0. Let H be a general member of |rT | intersecting V where
r is suﬃciently large depending on P. Then H is irreducible and smooth, (X, H) is plt
but (X, H + L) is not plt near any component of V ∩ H. This implies (H, LH ) is not klt
near any component of V ∩ H where LH = L|H [31, Theorem 5.50]. Letting NH = N |H,
we see that NH is supported in TH = T |H with absolute value of coeﬃcients ≤ δ. By
construction, (H, TH ) belongs to a bounded set of couples Q. So applying induction we get
a contradiction as δ can be chosen according to Q depending only on P.

Now assume V is inside some component S of B. Let ∆ = B + (1 − b)S where b = µSB.
Then (X, ∆) is plt and ⌊∆⌋ = S. Moreover, by the arguments of the third paragraph of this
proof we can assume l = µSL < ǫ ≤ 1−b, hence B +L ≤ ∆+L−lS. Thus S and V are both
non-klt centres of (X, ∆ + L − lS), so it cannot be plt near V . Let KS + ∆S = (KS + ∆)|S
and LS = (L − lS)|S . Then (S, ∆S ) is ǫ-lc but (S, ∆S + LS) is not klt. Perhaps after
adding some components to T , we can assume S ∼ S′ where S′ is supported in T and with
bounded coeﬃcients. By construction, LS ∼R NS := (N − lS′)|S is supported on TS := T |S
and the absolute value of each coeﬃcient of NS is at most nδ where n ∈ N depends only
on P. Moreover, (S, Supp ∆S + TS) belongs to a bounded set of couples R depending only
on P. Now applying induction we again get a contradiction.

(cid:3)

4.3. Eﬀective birationality for Fano varieties with good Q-complements.

Proposition 4.4. Let d ∈ N and ǫ, δ ∈ R>0. Then there exists a number v depending only
on d, ǫ, and δ satisfying the following. Assume
• X is an ǫ-lc Fano variety of dimension d,
• m ∈ N is the smallest number such that | − mKX| deﬁnes a birational map,
• n ∈ N is a number such that vol(−nKX) > (2d)d, and

28

Caucher Birkar

• nKX + N ∼Q 0 for some Q-divisor N ≥ 0 with coeﬃcients ≥ δ.

Then m

n < v.

Proof. Step 1. If the proposition does not hold, then there is a sequence Xi, mi, ni, Ni of
Fano varieties, numbers, and divisors as in the statement such that the numbers mi
form
ni
a strictly increasing sequence approaching ∞. Let φi : Wi → Xi be a log resolution so that
the movable part of φ∗
i (−miKXi) is base point free. Let AWi be a general divisor linearly
equivalent to the movable part and let RWi be the ﬁxed part. So φ∗
i (−miKXi) ∼ AWi +RWi.
We denote the pushdown of AWi, RWi to Xi by Ai, Ri respectively. Note that RWi is only
a Q-divisor but Ri is integral.

Step 2. In this step i is ﬁxed. Applying 2.16 (2), there is a bounded covering family of
subvarieties of Xi (as in 2.12) such that for any two general closed points xi, yi ∈ Xi we
can choose a member Gi of the family and choose a Q-divisor 0 ≤ ∆i ∼Q −(ni + 1)KXi
so that (Xi, ∆i) is lc near xi with a unique non-klt place whose centre contains xi, that
centre is Gi, and (Xi, ∆i) is not lc near yi. Note that since xi, yi are general, we can
assume Gi is a general member of the family. Recall from 2.12 that this means the family
is given by ﬁnitely many morphisms V j → T j of projective varieties with accompanying
surjective morphisms V j → X and that each Gi is a general ﬁbre of one of these morphisms.
Moreover, we can assume the points of T j corresponding to such Gi are dense in T j. Let
di := max{dim V j − dim T j}.

If di = 0, that is, if dim Gi = 0 for all the Gi, then −2(ni + 1)KXi

is potentially
birational, hence |KXi − 2(ni + 1)KXi | deﬁnes a birational map [15, Lemma 2.3.4] which
means mi ≤ 2ni + 1 giving a contradiction as we can assume mi/ni ≫ 0. Thus we can
assume di > 0, so there is j such that dim Gi > 0 for all the Gi appearing as general ﬁbres
of V j → T j.

Deﬁne li ∈ N to be the smallest number so that vol(−liKXi|Gi) > dd for all the Gi
with positive dimension. Then we can assume there is j so that if Gi is a general ﬁbre of
V j → T j, then Gi is positive dimensional and vol(−(li − 1)KXi|Gi) ≤ dd.

Step 3. Assume li
ni

is bounded from above by some natural number a. Then after
replacing ni with dani and applying the second paragraph of 2.16 (2), for each i, we can
replace the positive dimensional Gi with new ones of smaller dimension, and replace the
family accordingly, hence decrease the number di. Repeating the process we get to the
situation in which we can assume li
is an increasing sequence approaching ∞ otherwise we
ni
get the case di = 0 which yields a contradiction as in Step 2. On the other hand, if mi
is
li
not bounded from above, then we can assume mi
is an increasing sequence approaching ∞,
li
hence we can replace ni with li in which case li
is bounded and we can argue as before.
ni
So we can assume mi
li

is bounded from above.

In order to get a contradiction in the following steps it suﬃces to consider only those
Gi which are positive dimensional and vol(−(li − 1)KXi |Gi) ≤ dd. By Step 2, there is a
sub-family of such Gi appearing as general ﬁbres of some V j → T j. From now on when we
mention Gi we assume it is positive dimensional and it satisﬁes the inequality just stated.
In particular,

vol(−miKXi|Gi) = (

is bounded from above, so vol(Ai|Gi) is bounded from above where Ai is as in Step 1.

Step 4. For each i pick a general Gi as in the last paragraph and let Fi be its nor-
malisation. By Theorem 3.9 and the ACC for lc thresholds [14, Theorem 1.1], there is a
Q-boundary ΘFi with coeﬃcients in a ﬁxed DCC set Φ depending only on d such that we
can write

(KXi + ∆i)|Fi ∼Q KFi + ∆Fi := KFi + ΘFi + PFi

where PFi is pseudo-eﬀective. By replacing ni and adding to ∆i we can assume PFi ≥ 1
mi
where MFi = Mi|Fi and Mi := Ai + Ri.

MFi

As Gi is among the general members of a covering family of subvarieties, by Lemma 3.11,
we can write KXi|Fi = KFi + ΛFi for some sub-boundary ΛFi such that (Fi, ΛFi) is sub-ǫ-lc
and ΛFi ≤ ΘFi ≤ ∆Fi.

Step 5. Fix a rational number ǫ′ ∈ (0, ǫ) such that ǫ′ < min Φ>0. Let fi : F ′

KFi + ∆Fi ∼Q −niKXi|Fi , 5dMFi ∼Q −5dmiKXi|Fi

and the fact that vol(−(ni + 5dmi)KXi|Fi) is bounded from above, by the end of Step 3.

vol(KFi + ΩFi) ≤ vol(KFi + ∆Fi + 5dMFi)

. This follows if we show ∆Fi + 5dMFi − ΩFi is big.
where ΩFi is the pushdown of ΩF ′
As PFi is big, it is enough to show ΘFi + 5dMFi − ΩFi is big. Note that by Lemma 3.10,
µD(ΘFi + MFi) ≥ 1 for any component D of MFi.

Let D be a component of ΩFi. Then either D is a component of MFi or a component of

ΘFi or D = HFi the pushdown of HF ′

µDΩFi = 1 − ǫ′ < 1 ≤ µD(ΘFi + MFi).

If D is as in the second case but not the ﬁrst case, then

ǫ′ = µDΩFi ≤ µDΘFi ≤ µD(ΘFi + MFi).

So we get ΩFi − 1

Proposition 4.5. Let d ∈ N and ǫ, δ ∈ R>0. Then there exists a number m ∈ N depending

d such that KX + B ∼Q 0 for some Q-divisor B ≥ 0 with coeﬃcients ≥ δ. Then | − mKX|
deﬁnes a birational map.

Proof. If the proposition is not true, then there is a sequence of Fano varieties Xi and
Q-divisors Bi satisfying the assumptions of the proposition but such that if mi ∈ N is
the smallest number so that | − miKXi| deﬁnes a birational map, then the mi form a
strictly increasing sequence approaching ∞. Let ni ∈ N be the smallest number so that
vol(−niKXi) > (2d)d. By Proposition 4.4, there is a number v independent of i such that

KWi + ΣWi + 2(2d + 1)AWi

vol(KXi + Σi + 2(2d + 1)Ai) ≤ vol(KXi + Ri + (4d + 3)Ai)

≤ vol((4d + 3)Ri + (4d + 3)Ai) ≤ vol(−(4d + 3)miKXi)

where Σi is the pushdown of ΣWi. Therefore, (Wi, ΣWi) is log birationally bounded by [15,
Lemmas 3.2 and 2.4.2(4)]. More precisely, if Wi → ˜Wi is the contraction deﬁned by AWi,
then ( ˜Wi, Σ ˜Wi
) is log bounded. Thus perhaps after replacing Wi there is a log resolution
W i → ˜Wi of ( ˜Wi, Σ ˜Wi
) such that the induced map Wi → W i is a morphism and (W i, ΣW i
)
is log smooth and log bounded where ΣW i is the pushdown of ΣWi.

is bounded from above, one can show the coeﬃcients of AW i +RW i are bounded from above
by calculating intersection numbers as in Step 8 of the proof of Proposition 4.4. So if mi is
suﬃciently large, then the coeﬃcients of 1
RW i are suﬃciently small. Therefore,

if we pick ǫ′ ∈ (0, ǫ), then there is a boundary ΓW i supported on ΣW i such that (W i, ΓW i)

Proof. Step 1. If the proposition does not hold, then there is a sequence Xi of Fano varieties
of dimension d and an increasing sequence ǫi of numbers in (0, 1) approaching 1 such that Xi
is ǫi-lc and if mi ∈ N is the smallest number such that | − miKXi| deﬁnes a birational map,
then the mi form an increasing sequence approaching ∞. Let ni ∈ N be the smallest number
so that vol(−niKX ) > (2d)d. First we want to show mi

We apply Steps 1-9 of the proof of Proposition 4.4 in our situation. Recall that those
steps did not use δ and the Ni. We use the notation and assumptions made in those steps.

Step 2. By Lemma 3.11, (Fi, ΛFi) is sub-ǫi-lc. Pick ǫ ∈ (0, 1) so that ǫ < ǫi for every i.
Assume (Fi, ∆Fi) is not ǫ-lc for any i. Then for each i, there is a prime divisor Di on some
birational model of Fi such that a(Di, Fi, ∆Fi) < ǫ. Replacing F ′
i we can assume Di is a
divisor on F ′
≤ 1 − ǫi.
So

which is bounded from below. Therefore, if c is a suﬃciently large number, then (Fi, ∆Fi +
cIFi) is not klt for every i as we can assume µDi(∆F ′
) > 1. Moreover, KFi +∆Fi +cIFi
is ample. Thus (F i, ∆F i + cIF i) is not sub-klt for every i. Letting LFi := (c + 1)IFi, the
pair (F i, ΓF i + LF i) is not klt for every i because

∆F i + cIF i ≤ ΓF i + LF i

(c+1)(ni+1)

= LFi|F ′

where LF i is the pushdown of LF ′
and as the coeﬃcients of the right hand side approach 0 when i goes
LF i
to ∞. Therefore, from now on we can assume (Fi, ∆Fi) is ǫ-lc for every i. Note that the
above arguments show (Fi, ∆Fi) is ǫ-lc for any choice of PFi ≥ 0 in its R-linear equivalence
class.

Now since the ǫi approach 1, we can choose ǫ close enough to 1 so that 1 − ǫ < s for any
0 < s ∈ Φ where Φ is the DCC set to which the coeﬃcients of ΘFi belong. In particular,
ΛFi ≤ 0 for every i otherwise if Di is a component of ΛFi with positive coeﬃcient, then
from ΛFi ≤ ΘFi ≤ ∆Fi we deduce µDi∆Fi > 1−ǫ contradicting the ǫ-lc property of (Fi, ∆Fi).

Step 3. By construction,

KF i + ΛF i +

mi

MF i ∼Q 0

Moreover, any component of ΛF i with positive coeﬃcient is exceptional/Fi, hence a compo-
nent of ΓF i, and its coeﬃcient in ΛF i is at most 1−ǫi. So the coeﬃcients of (ΛF i + 1
MF i)≥0
get arbitrarily small as i gets large. As (F i, Supp ΓF i) is log bounded and

mi

Supp(ΛF i +

MF i)≥0 ⊆ Supp ΓF i,

we can assume KF i is pseudo-eﬀective for every i, by Lemma 2.21.

First assume κσ(KF i) > 0 for every i. Then for each number q there is a number p such
that vol(pKF i +AF i) > q for every i, by Lemma 2.24. This in turn gives vol(pKFi +AFi) > q.
Therefore, both sides of the inequality

go to ∞ as i goes to ∞. But

vol(

and the right hand side is bounded from above, a contradiction. Thus from now on we can
assume κσ(KF i) = 0 for every i.

Step 4. Since κσ(KF i) = 0, there is r ∈ N such that h0(rKF i) 6= 0 for every i, by Lemma
2.19. Then h0(rKFi) 6= 0 for every i, hence rKFi ∼ TFi for some integral divisor TFi ≥ 0.
First assume TFi 6= 0 for every i. Then r(KFi + ∆Fi) ∼Q QFi := r∆Fi + TFi. Thus

(r + 1)(KFi + ∆Fi) ∼Q KFi + ∆Fi + QFi

and (Fi, ∆Fi + QFi) is not klt as QFi ≥ TFi. Therefore, letting LFi := IFi + QFi, noting
LF i ∼R ( ni+1

Now we can assume TFi = 0 for every i. Then

h0(−rKXi|Fi) = h0(−r(KFi + ΛFi)) = h0(−rΛFi) 6= 0

for every i because ΛFi ≤ 0. Thus by Step 2 and Proposition 3.13, perhaps after replacing
r with a multiple, h0(−nirKXi) 6= 0 for every i. Then niKXi + Ni ∼Q 0 for some Ni ≥ 0
with coeﬃcients ≥ 1

is bounded from above. Recall that φi : Wi → Xi is a resolution so that φ∗
i (−miKXi) ∼
AWi +RWi with AWi base point free and RWi the ﬁxed part of φ∗
i (−miKXi). We can assume
AWi is general in its linear system. Since vol(−miKXi) is bounded from above, as in the
proof Proposition 4.5, we can assume there exist log bounded log smooth pairs (W i, ΣW i)
and birational morphisms Wi → W i so that Supp ΣW i contains the exceptional divisors of
Wi 99K Xi and the support of AW i + RW i, the pushdown of AWi + RWi. Moreover, the
coeﬃcients of AW i + RW i are bounded from above.

Let KWi + ΛWi be the pullback of KXi and let KW i + ΛW i be its pushdown on W i. The

RW i)≥0
are suﬃciently small. Thus KW i is pseudo-eﬀective for every i ≫ 0, by Lemma 2.21. This
is a contradiction because KWi is not pseudo-eﬀective hence KW i is not pseudo-eﬀective
for every i. Therefore, mi is bounded as required.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.4

Lemma 5.1. Let (X, B), ∆, G, F, ΘF , and PF be as in Theorem 3.9 where G is not nec-
essarily a general member of a covering family. Assume X is Q-factorial near the generic
point of G, PF is big, and (X, B + ∆) has a non-klt centre intersecting G. Then for any
ǫ ∈ (0, 1) we can choose PF ≥ 0 so that (F, ΘF + PF ) is not ǫ-lc.

Proof. Recall (Y, ΓY + NY ) and (S, ΓS + NS) of the proof of Lemma 3.10. Let I 6= G be a
maximal non-klt centre intersecting G. We can assume some component of ⌊ΓY ⌋ − S maps
onto I. Let x ∈ I ∩ G be a closed point. Since ⌊ΓY ⌋ is the non-klt locus of (Y, ΓY + NY ),
by the connectedness principle, ⌊ΓY ⌋ is connected near the ﬁbre of Y → X over x. Thus

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

35

some component of ⌊ΓY ⌋ − S intersects the ﬁbre of S → G over x, hence (⌊ΓY ⌋ − S)|S 6= 0
which is vertical over F which in turn implies (S, ΓS + NS) has a divisorial non-klt centre
vertical over F . Therefore, by Lemma 3.7, there is a resolution F ′ → F such that if ΩF ′
and RF ′ are the discriminant and moduli parts of adjuction on F ′ for (S, ΓS + NS) over F ,
then ΩF ′ has a coeﬃcient ≥ 1 and RF ′ is pseudo-eﬀective. Since ΩF ≥ ΘF and since PF is
big, taking an average (1 − t)(ΩF + RF ) + t(ΘF + PF ) for some small t ∈ (0, 1) we can ﬁnd
PF ≥ 0 in its R-linear equivalence class so that (F, ΘF + PF ) is not ǫ-lc.

Proof. Step 1. If the statement is not true, then there is a sequence of pairs (Xi, Bi) sat-
isfying the properties listed in Theorem 1.4 such that vol(−KXi) is an increasing sequence
approaching ∞. Taking a Q-factorialisation we can assume Xi is Q-factorial. Note that Xi
is Fano type. Run an MMP on −KXi ∼R Bi and let X ′

we can assume Xi is Fano. Moreover, modifying Bi, we can assume it is a Q-boundary. By
Proposition 4.5, there is m ∈ N such that |−mKXi| deﬁnes a birational map for every i. Let
φi : Wi → Xi be a resolution so that φ∗(−mKXi) decomposes as the sum of a base point free
part AWi and ﬁxed part RWi. Since vol(−KXi) is an increasing sequence approaching ∞,
there is a strictly decreasing sequence ai ∈ Q>0 approaching 0 so that vol(−aiKXi) > (2d)d

Step 2.

In this paragraph, ﬁx i. Applying 2.16 (2), there exists a covering family of
subvarieties of Xi such that for each pair of general closed points xi, yi ∈ Xi there exist a
general member Gi of the family and a Q-divisor 0 ≤ ∆i ∼Q −aiKXi such that (Xi, ∆i) is
lc at xi with a unique non-klt place whose centre contains xi, that centre is Gi, and (Xi, ∆i)
is not lc at yi. Recall from 2.12 that such Gi are among the general ﬁbres of ﬁnitely many
morphisms V j → T j, and we can assume for each j the points on T j corresponding to the
Gi are dense. Since KXi + ∆i is anti-ample, by the connectedness principle, dim Gi > 0.
Let bi ∈ Q be the smallest number so that vol(−biKXi|Gi) ≥ dd + 1 for all the Gi; we can
assume equality is obtained on a subfamily of the Gi which are general ﬁbres of one of the
morphisms V j → T j.

Assume bi is not bounded from below, so we can assume bi is a strictly decreasing sequence
approaching 0. Applying the second paragraph of 2.16 (2), replacing ai with ai+(d−1)bi and
replacing the ∆i, we can replace each Gi with one having smaller dimension. Introducing
new bi as above and repeating the process leads us to the case when bi is bounded from
below otherwise we get the case dim Gi = 0 which is not possible as mentioned above.

In order to get a contradiction, for each i, it is enough to consider a sub-family of the
Gi satisfying vol(−biKXi|Gi) = dd + 1 and which are general ﬁbres of one of the mor-
phisms V j → T j. From now on when we mention Gi we mean one of those. In particular,
vol(−KXi|Gi) is bounded from above as bi is bounded from below.

Step 3. For each i pick a general Gi as in the last paragraph, and let Fi be its normali-
sation. Let F ′
99K Wi is a morphism. Since vol(−KXi|Gi)
is bounded from above, the volume of AF ′
is also bounded from above. By
Theorem 3.9, there is a Q-boundary ΘFi with coeﬃcients in a ﬁxed DCC set Φ depending

Step 4. By the connectedness principle, the non-klt locus of (Xi, ∆i) is connected. Since
(Xi, ∆i) is not lc at some point, the pair has a non-klt centre intersecting Gi but not equal
to Gi. By Lemma 5.1, we can choose PFi ≥ 0 so that (Fi, ∆Fi) is not ǫ′-lc, hence we can

KFi + BFi ∼Q 0 and

IFi = KFi + ∆Fi − (KFi + ΛFi) ∼Q (KXi + ∆i − KXi)|Fi ∼Q −aiKXi|Fi

Proof. (of Theorem 1.4) Taking a Q-factorialisation we can assume X is Q-factorial. Run
an MMP on −KX and let X ′ be the resulting model. Since B is big, −KX ′ is nef and big,
that is, X ′ is a weak Fano. It is enough to show such X ′ are bounded because then there
is a klt n-complement of KX ′ which in turn gives a klt n-complement of KX for some n
independent of X, hence we can apply [16, Theorem 1.3]. So replacing X with X ′ we can
assume X is weak Fano. Now −KX deﬁnes a birational contraction X → X ′′ and replacing
X with X ′′ we can assume X is Fano. Pick ǫ′ ∈ (0, ǫ). Let ∆ = (1 + t)B for some t > 0 so
that (X, ∆) is ǫ′-lc. By [14, Theorem 1.6], it is enough to show (X, ∆) is log birationally
bounded which is equivalent to showing (X, B) is log birationally bounded.

By Proposition 4.5, there is m ∈ N depending only on d, ǫ, δ such that | − mKX| deﬁnes
a birational map. Let φ : W → X be a log resolution so that φ∗(−mKX ) decomposes as
the sum of a base point free AW and ﬁxed part RW . By Proposition 5.2, vol(−KX ) is
bounded from above, hence vol(AW ) is bounded from above. Let ΣW be the sum of the
reduced exceptional divisor of φ and the support of the birational transform of B. Then
vol(KW + ΣW + 2(2d + 1)AW ) is bounded from above because

vol(KX + Σ + 2(2d + 1)A) ≤ vol(KX +

1
δ

B + 2(2d + 1)A) ≤ vol(−rKX)

for some r depending only on d, δ, m where Σ and A are the pushdowns of ΣW and AW .
Therefore, (W, ΣW ) is log birationally bounded by [15, Lemmas 3.2 and 2.4.2(4)] which
implies (X, B) is also log birationally bounded as required.

6. Boundedness of complements

In this section we develop the theory of complements for generalised pairs following
[37][35][34]. We prove various inductive statements before we come to the main result of
this section (6.13).

6.1. General remarks. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised pair with data
φ : X → X ′ and M .

(1) Assume there is B′+ ≥ B′ such that (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is generalised lc, nM is Cartier,
and n(KX ′ + B′+ + M ′) ∼ 0 for some n ∈ N. We show KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ is an n-complement
of KX ′ + B′ + M ′. Writing B′ = T ′ + ∆′ where T ′ = ⌊B′⌋, we need to show nB′+ ≥
nT ′ + ⌊(n + 1)∆′⌋. Let D′ be a prime divisor and b′ and b′+ be its coeﬃcients in B′ and
B′+.
If b′+ = 1, then either b′ = 1 in which case nb′+ = nb′, or b′ < 1 in which case
nb′+ = n ≥ ⌊(n + 1)b′⌋. So assume b′+ < 1, say b′+ = i

n . Then
nb′+ = i = (cid:4)(n + 1)b′+(cid:5) ≥ (cid:4)(n + 1)b′(cid:5) .

(2) Assume X ′ 99K X ′′ is a birational map to a normal projective variety. Replacing X
we can assume the induced map ψ : X 99K X ′′ is a morphism. Let M ′′ = ψ∗M and assume

φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) + P = ψ∗(KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′)

for some P ≥ 0 and B′′ ≥ 0. Suppose KX ′′ +B′′+M ′′ has an n-complement KX ′′ +B′′++M ′′
with B′′+ ≥ B′′. We claim KX ′ + B′ + M ′ has an n-complement KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ with
B′+ ≥ B′. Let C ′′ = B′′+ − B′′, let C ′ = φ∗(P + ψ∗C ′′), and let B′+ = B′ + C ′. Then
n(KX ′ + B′+ + C ′) ∼ 0 and

φ∗(KX ′ + B′+ + M ′) = ψ∗(KX ′′ + B′′+ + M ′′)

hence (X ′, B′+ + C ′) is generalised lc. Now apply (1).

38

(3) Assume X ′ 99K X ′′ is a partial MMP on −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) and B′′, M ′′ are the
pushdowns of B′, M ′. Then there is P ≥ 0 as in (2). Thus if KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ has an n-
complement KX ′′ + B′′+ + M ′′ with B′′+ ≥ B′′, then KX ′ + B′ + M ′ has an n-complement
KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ with B′+ ≥ B′.

6.2. Hyperstandard coeﬃcients under adjunction for ﬁbre spaces. The existence
of S in the next result is similar to [34, Lemma 9.3(i)].

Proposition 6.3. Let d ∈ N and R ⊂ [0, 1] be a ﬁnite set of rational numbers. Assume
Theorem 1.8 holds in dimension d. Then there exist q ∈ N and a ﬁnite set of rational
numbers S ⊂ [0, 1] depending only on d, R satisfying the following. Assume (X, B) is a
pair and f : X → Z a contraction such that

• (X, B) is projective lc of dimension d, and dim Z > 0,
• KX + B ∼Q 0/Z and B ∈ Φ(R),
• X is Fano type over some non-empty open subset U ⊆ Z, and
• the generic point of each non-klt centre of (X, B) maps into U .

Then we can write

q(KX + B) ∼ qf ∗(KZ + BZ + MZ )

where BZ and MZ are the discriminant and moduli parts of adjunction (as in 3.4), BZ ∈
Φ(S), and for any high resolution Z ′ → Z the moduli divisor qMZ ′ is nef Cartier.

Proof. Step 1. Let q = n be the number given by Theorem 1.8 which depends only on d, R.
Then there is a q-complement KX + B+ of KX + B over some point z ∈ U with B+ ≥ B.
Since over z we have KX + B ∼Q 0 and q(KX + B+) ∼ 0, and since B+ ≥ B, we have
B+ = B near the generic ﬁbre of f . Therefore, q(KX + B) ∼ 0 over the generic point of
Z, hence there is a rational function α on X such that qL := q(KX + B) + Div(α) is zero
over the generic point of Z. In particular, q(KX + B) ∼ qL and L is vertical/Z. Since
L ∼Q 0/Z, L = f ∗LZ for some LZ on Z. Let MZ := LZ − (KZ + BZ ) where BZ is the
discriminant part of adjunction for (X, B) over Z. Thus

q(KX + B) ∼ qL = qf ∗LZ = qf ∗(KZ + BZ + MZ )

and MZ is the moduli part of adjunction for (X, B) over Z. Note that MZ is not unique:
it depends on the choice of α and KZ .

Step 2. Our aim until the end of Step 3 is to show the existence of S and to show qMZ is
integral. First we reduce these claims to the case dim Z = 1. Assume dim Z > 1. Let D be
a prime divisor on Z. Let H be a general hyperplane section of Z and G its pullback to X.
Let KG + BG = (KX + B + G)|G. Since G is a general member of a free linear system, each
non-klt centre of (G, BG) is a component of the intersection of a non-klt centre of (X, B)
with G, hence its generic point maps into U ∩ H. Moreover, G is Fano type over U ∩ H.
Let BH be the discriminant part of adjunction for (G, BG) over H. Let C be a component
of D ∩ H. Using inversion of adjunction one can show that µDBZ = µCBH (cf. [4, proof of
Lemma 3.2]). By Lemma 3.3, there is a ﬁnite set of rational numbers T ⊂ [0, 1] depending
only on R such that BG ∈ Φ(T). So applying induction on dimension, there is a ﬁnite set
of rational numbers S ⊂ [0, 1] depending only on d − 1, T hence depending only on d, R
such that BH ∈ Φ(S). Therefore, BZ ∈ Φ(S).

Let g be the induced map G → H. Pick a general H ′ ∼ H and let KH = (KZ +
H ′)|H where the restriction is well-deﬁned as H is a general hyperplane section, and KH is

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

39

determined as a Weil divisor. Letting MH := (LZ + H ′)|H − (KH + BH), we have

q(KG + BG) ∼ qg∗(KH + BH + MH )

hence MH is the moduli part of (G, BG) over H. Moreover, BH + MH = (BZ + MZ )|H ,
hence µC(BH + MH ) = µD(BZ + MZ ) which implies µCMH = µDMZ as µCBH = µDBZ.
Therefore, qµDMZ is integral iﬀ qµCMH is integral. So repeating the process we reduce
the problem to the case dim Z = 1.

Step 3. In this step we assume Z is a curve. By Lemma 2.5, X is Fano type over Z.
Pick a closed point z ∈ Z. Let t be the lc threshold of f ∗z with respect to (X, B). Let
Γ = B + tf ∗z and let (X ′, Γ′) be a Q-factorial dlt model of (X, Γ) so that ⌊Γ′⌋ has a
component mapping to z. Note that KX ′ + Γ′ ∼Q 0/Z. Then there is a boundary B′ ≤ Γ′
such that B′ ∈ Φ(R), ⌊B′⌋ has a component mapping to z, and B∼ ≤ B′ where B∼ is the
birational transform of B. Now X ′ is Fano type over Z and −(KX ′ + B′) ∼Q Γ′ − B′/Z.
Run an MMP on −(KX ′ + B′) over Z and let X ′′ be the resulting model. Then X ′′ is Fano
type over Z, B′′ ∈ Φ(R), and −(KX ′′ + B′′) is nef over Z. Moreover, (X ′′, B′′) is lc, as
(X ′′, Γ′′) is lc and B′′ ≤ Γ′′. By our choice of q which comes from Theorem 1.8, KX ′′ + B′′
has a q-complement KX ′′ + B′′+ over z with B′′+ ≥ B′′. Thus by the arguments of 6.1 in
the relative setting, there is a q-complement KX ′ + B′+ of KX ′ + B′ over z with B′+ ≥ B′.
Pushing KX ′ + B′+ down to X gives a q-complement KX + B+ of KX + B over z with
B+ ≥ B such that (X, B+) has a non-klt centre mapping to z. Now B+ − B ∼Q 0 over z,
hence B+ − B is vertical over Z. Thus over z, the divisor B+ − B is just a multiple of the
ﬁbre f ∗z. Therefore, B+ = B + tf ∗z over z as (X, B+) has a non-klt centre mapping to z.
Recall that the coeﬃcient of z in BZ is 1 − t. Pick a component S of f ∗z and let b and
b+ be its coeﬃcients in B and B+. If m is its coeﬃcient in f ∗z, then b+ = b + tm, hence
t = b+−b
l . If b+ = 1,
l ≤ b+ ≤ q−1
then t = r
q ,
so l ≤ q, hence there are ﬁnitely many possibilities for s. This proves the existence of S.

lm . If b+ < 1, then as s ≥ 0 and as qb+ is integral we get 1− 1

m . Now b = 1− r

l for some r ∈ R and l ∈ N, so t = s

m where s = b+ −1+ r

l ≤ 1− r

Now we show qMZ is integral. By Step 1, q(KX + B) ∼ 0 over some non-empty open
set V ⊆ Z such that Supp BZ ⊆ Z \ V . Let Θ = B + Pz∈Z\V tzf ∗z where tz is the lc
threshold of f ∗z with respect to (X, B). If ΘZ is the discriminant part of adjunction for
(X, Θ) over Z, then ΘZ = BZ + Pz∈Z\V tzz, hence ΘZ is a reduced divisor. Moreover, by
the above arguments, KX + Θ is a q-complement of KX + B over each z ∈ Z \ V , hence
q(KX + Θ) ∼ 0/Z. Therefore, since

q(KX + Θ) = q(KX + B) + q(Θ − B)

∼ qf ∗(KZ + BZ + MZ) + qf ∗(ΘZ − BZ ) = qf ∗(KZ + ΘZ + MZ )

we deduce q(KZ +ΘZ +MZ) is Cartier. This implies qMZ is integral as KZ +ΘZ is integral.

Step 4. It remains to show qMZ ′ is nef Cartier where Z ′ → Z is a high resolution and
dim Z is arbitrary. The nefness follows from Theorem 3.6, so we just need to show qMZ ′
is integral. Let X ′ → X be a log resolution of (X, B) so that X ′ 99K Z ′ is a morphism.
Let U0 ⊆ U be an open set over which Z ′ → Z is an isomorphism. Let ∆′ be the sum
of the birational transform of B and the reduced exceptional divisor of X ′ → X but with
all the components mapping outside U0 removed. We can assume the generic point of any
non-klt centre of (X ′, ∆′) maps into U0. Run an MMP on KX ′ + ∆′ over Z ′ ×Z X with
0 ⊂ Z ′, the
scaling of some ample divisor. By [5, Theorem 1.9], the MMP terminates over U ′
0 the pair (X ′′, ∆′′) is a
inverse image of U0. In fact we reach a model X ′′ such that over U ′

40

Caucher Birkar

0 and X ′′ is Fano type over
Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B), hence KX ′′ + ∆′′ ∼Q 0 over U ′
0. Now by [5, Theorem 1.4][14], we can run an MMP/Z ′ on KX ′′ + ∆′′ which terminates
U ′
with a good minimal model over Z ′ because the generic point of every non-klt centre of
0. Abusing notation, we denote the minimal model again by X ′′
(X ′′, ∆′′) is mapped into U ′
which is Fano type over U ′
0.

Let f ′′ : X ′′ → Z ′′/Z ′ be the contraction deﬁned by KX ′′ + ∆′′. By construction, on a
common resolution W of X and X ′′, the pullbacks of KX + B and KX ′′ + ∆′′ are equal
0 ⊂ Z ′′, the inverse image of U0. Let KX ′′ + B′′ and L′′ be the pushdown to
over U ′′
X ′′ of the pullback of KX + B and L to W , respectively. Let P ′′ = ∆′′ − B′′ which is
vertical and ∼Q 0 over Z ′′, hence it is the pullback of some Q-divisor PZ ′′ on Z ′′. Denote
by ∆Z ′′ the discriminant part of adjunction on Z ′′ deﬁned for (X ′′, ∆′′) over Z ′′. Then
∆Z ′′ = BZ ′′ + PZ ′′ where BZ ′′ is the discriminant part of adjunction on Z ′′ deﬁned for
(X, B) over Z. Moreover,

q(KX ′′ + ∆′′) = q(KX ′′ + B′′ + P ′′) ∼ q(L′′ + P ′′) = qf ′′∗(LZ ′′ + PZ ′′)

= qf ′′∗(KZ ′′ + ∆Z ′′ + MZ ′′)

where LZ ′′ is the pullback of LZ in Step 1, and MZ ′′ = LZ ′′ − (KZ ′′ + BZ ′′) is the moduli
part of both (X ′′, ∆′′) over Z ′′ and (X, B) over Z. Now by Steps 2-3, qMZ ′′ is an integral
divisor, hence qMZ ′ is integral as well which means it is Cartier as Z ′ is smooth.
(cid:3)

6.4. Pulling back complements from the base of a ﬁbration.

Proposition 6.5. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds
in dimension d. Then Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension d for those (X ′, B′ + M ′) such that
there is a contraction X ′ → V ′ so that KX ′ + B′ + M ′ ∼Q 0/V ′, dim V ′ > 0, and M ′ is not
big/V ′.

Proof. Step 1. Replacing (X ′, B′ + M ′) with a Q-factorial generalised dlt model as in 2.6(2)
and applying 6.1(2), we can assume X ′ is Q-factorial. Since M ′ is not big/V ′, X ′ → V ′ is
not birational. After running an MMP/V ′ on M ′ and applying 6.1(2) once more, we can
assume M ′ is semi-ample/V ′. So X ′ → V ′ factors through a contraction f ′ : X ′ → T ′ such
that dim X ′ > dim T ′ and M ′ ∼Q 0/T ′.

By construction, KX ′ + B′ ∼Q 0/T ′, and by assumption X ′ is Fano type. Thus by
Proposition 6.3 (which needs Theorem 1.8 in dimension d) there exist q ∈ N and a ﬁnite
set of rational numbers S ⊂ [0, 1] depending only on d, R such that

q(KX ′ + B′) ∼ qf ′∗(KT ′ + BT ′ + PT ′)

where BT ′ and PT ′ are the discriminant and moduli divisors of adjunction for ﬁbre spaces
applied to (X ′, B′) over T ′, and such that BT ′ ∈ Φ(S) and qPT is nef Cartier for any high
resolution T → T ′. We can assume q is divisible by p.

Step 2. Pick a suﬃciently high resolution ψ : T → T ′ so that the moduli part PT is
nef and it satisﬁes the pullback property of Theorem 3.6 (ii). We consider (T ′, BT ′ + PT ′)
as a generalised pair with data ψ : T → T ′ and PT . It is generalised lc because (X ′, B′)
is lc. Replace X so that the induced map f : X 99K T is a morphism. Since M is nef,
φ∗M ′ = M + E for some exceptional/X ′ and eﬀective Q-divisor E. Since M ′ ∼Q 0/T ′, E
is vertical/T ′, so there is a non-empty open subset of T ′ over which E = 0 and M ∼Q 0.
Since X ′ is Fano type, the general ﬁbres of f ′ are also Fano type, hence they are rationally
connected which in turn implies the general ﬁbres of f are rationally connected [13][40].
Thus perhaps after replacing X and T and applying Lemma 2.28, pM ∼ pf ∗MT for a Q-
divisor MT on T so that pMT is nef Cartier. Moreover, since E is vertical and ∼Q 0 over T ,

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

41

E = f ∗ET for some eﬀective Q-divisor ET . On the other hand, since E is exceptional/X ′,
applying [5, Lemma 3.2] to E over T ′ shows that E is very exceptional over T ′ which in
turn implies ET is exceptional over T ′. In particular, this means MT ′ := ψ∗MT is Q-Cartier
as MT + ET ∼Q 0/T ′. By construction, q(PT + MT ) is nef Cartier and qM ′ ∼ qf ′∗MT ′.

Step 3. Now we consider (T ′, BT ′ + PT ′ + MT ′) as a generalised pair with data ψ : T → T ′
and PT + MT . We show it is is generalised lc. We can assume (T, BT + ET ) is log smooth
where BT is the discriminant divisor on T . By construction

KT + BT + ET + PT + MT = ψ∗(KT ′ + BT ′ + PT ′ + MT ′).

So it is enough to show (T, BT + ET ) is sub-lc which in turn is equivalent to saying that
every coeﬃcient of BT + ET is ≤ 1. Let KX + B be the pullback of KX ′ + B′. Let D
be a prime divisor on T . By deﬁnition of the discriminant divisor, µDBT = 1 − tD where
tD is the largest number so that (X, B + tDf ∗D) is sub-lc over the generic point of D.
Since (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc, (X, B + E) is sub-lc, and since E = f ∗ET , we have
µDET ≤ tD which implies µDBT + µDET ≤ 1.

Step 4. To summarise we have proved: (T ′, BT ′ +PT ′ +MT ′) is generalised lc, BT ′ ∈ Φ(S),

q(PT + MT ) is Cartier, and

q(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) ∼ qf ′∗(KT ′ + BT ′ + PT ′ + MT ′)

is anti-nef. Moreover, T ′ is Fano type as X ′ is Fano type (this follows from [2]). Now by
induction on dimension, KT ′+BT ′+PT ′+MT ′ has an n-complement KT ′+B+
T ′+PT ′+MT ′ for
some n divisible by qI(S) and depending only on dim T ′, q, S such that GT ′ := B+
T ′ −BT ′ ≥
0. So n depends only on d, p, R. Denote the pullback of GT ′ to T, X, X ′ by GT , G, G′
respectively. Let B′+ = B′ + G′. Then

n(KX ′ + B′+ + M ′) = n(KX ′ + B′ + M ′ + G′)

∼ nf ′∗(KT ′ + BT ′ + PT ′ + MT ′ + GT ′) = nf ′∗(KT ′ + B+

T ′ + PT ′ + MT ′) ∼ 0.

Thus by 6.1(1), KX ′ +B′+ +M ′ is an n-complement of KX ′ +B′ +M ′ if we show (X ′, B′+ +
M ′) is generalised lc.

Let C be a prime divisor on some birational model of X ′. Replacing X, T we can
assume C is a divisor on X and that its image on T is a divisor, say D. The pullback of
KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ to X is KX + B + E + G + M . It is enough to show µC(B + E + G) ≤ 1.
Since (T ′, B+

T ′ + PT ′ + MT ′) is generalised lc, and since
KT + BT + ET + GT + PT + MT = ψ∗(KT ′ + B+

T ′ + PT ′ + MT ′)

we have µD(BT +ET +GT ) ≤ 1. Letting tD be as in Step 3 we get µD(ET +GT ) ≤ tD which
implies (X, B + E + G) is sub-lc over the generic point of D. Therefore, µC(B + E + G) ≤ 1
as required.

(cid:3)

6.6. Lifting complements from a non-klt centre.

Proposition 6.7. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension d − 1. Then Theorem 1.9 holds
in dimension d for those (X ′, B′ + M ′) such that

• B′ ∈ R,
• (X ′, Γ′ + αM ′) is Q-factorial generalised plt for some Γ′ and α ∈ (0, 1),
• −(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′) is ample, and
• S′ = ⌊Γ′⌋ is irreducible and it is a component of ⌊B′⌋.

42

Caucher Birkar

Proof. Step 1. The idea is to construct a complement on S′ and then lift it to X ′. We can
assume the given map φ : X → X ′ is a log resolution and that the induced map ψ : S 99K S′
is a morphism where S is the birational transform of S′. By generalised adjunction we can
write

KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′ = (KX ′ + B′ + M ′)|S ′.

By Lemma 3.3, BS ′ ∈ Φ(S) for some ﬁnite set of rational numbers S ⊂ [0, 1] which only
depends on p, R. Restricting KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′ to S′ shows that S′ is Fano type, by 2.6(5).
On the other hand, pMS = pM |S is Cartier. Thus by Theorem 1.9 in dimension d− 1, there
is n ∈ N divisible by pI(S) which depends only on d − 1, p, S such that KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′ has
an n-complement KS ′ + B+
S ′ ≥ BS ′. Then n depends only on d, p, R and
replacing it with nI(R) we can assume it is divisible by pI(R). In particular, nB′ is integral
as B′ ∈ R. We will show there is an n-complement KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ of KX ′ + B′ + M ′ with
B′+ ≥ B′.

S ′ + MS ′ with B+

Step 2. Write

N := −(KX + B + M ) := −φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)

and let T = (cid:4)B≥0(cid:5) and ∆ = B − T . Deﬁne

L := −nKX − nT − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ − nM

which is an integral divisor. Note that

Now write

L = n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ + nN.

KX + Γ + αM = φ∗(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′).

Replacing Γ′ with (1−a)Γ′ +aB′ and replacing αM with ((1−a)α+a)M for some a ∈ (0, 1)
suﬃciently close to 1, we can assume α is suﬃciently close to 1 and B − Γ has suﬃciently
small (positive or negative) coeﬃcients.

Step 3. Let P be the unique integral divisor so that

Λ := Γ + n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ + P

is a boundary, (X, Λ) is plt, and ⌊Λ⌋ = S (in particular, we are assuming Λ ≥ 0). More
precisely, we let µSP = 0 and for each prime divisor D 6= S, we let

which satisﬁes

µDP = −µD ⌊Γ + n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋⌋

µDP = −µD ⌊Γ − ∆ + h(n + 1)∆i⌋

where h(n + 1)∆i is the fractional part of (n + 1)∆. This implies 0 ≤ µDP ≤ 1 for any
prime divisor D: indeed we can assume D 6= S; if D is a component of T , then D is not
a component of ∆ but µDΓ ∈ (0, 1), hence µDP = 0; if D is not a component of T , then
µD(Γ − ∆) = µD(Γ − B) is suﬃciently small, hence 0 ≤ µDP ≤ 1.

We show P is exceptional/X ′. Assume D is a component of P which is not exceptional/X ′.
Then D 6= S, and since nB′ is integral, µDn∆ is integral, hence µD ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ = µDn∆
which implies µDP = −µD ⌊Γ⌋ = 0, a contradiction.

Step 4. Let

A′ = −(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′)

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

43

and let A = φ∗A′. Then

L + P = n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ + nN + P

= KX + Γ + αM + A + n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ + nN + P

= KX + Λ + A + αM + nN

Since A + αM + nN is nef and big, h1(L + P − S) = 0 by the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing
theorem, hence

H 0(L + P ) → H 0((L + P )|S )

is surjective.

Step 5. Let RS ′ := B+

S ′ − BS ′ which satisﬁes

−n(KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′) ∼ nRS ′ ≥ 0.

Letting RS be the pullback of RS ′ we get

nNS := nN |S = −n(KS + BS + MS) = −nψ∗(KS ′ + BS ′ + MS ′) ∼ nRS ≥ 0.

By construction,

(L + P )|S = (n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ + nN + P )|S

∼ GS := nRS + n∆S − ⌊(n + 1)∆S⌋ + PS

where ∆S = ∆|S and PS = P |S.

We show GS ≥ 0. Assume C is a component of GS with negative coeﬃcient. Then there
is a component D of n∆ − ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ with negative coeﬃcient such that C is a component
of D|S. But

µC(n∆S − ⌊(n + 1)∆S⌋) = µC(−∆S + h(n + 1)∆Si) ≥ −µC∆S = −µD∆ > −1

which gives µCGS > −1 and this in turn implies µCGS ≥ 0 because GS is integral, a
contradiction. Therefore GS ≥ 0, and by Step 4, L + P ∼ G for some eﬀective divisor G
whose support does not contain S and G|S = GS.

Step 6. By the previous step,

−nKX ′ − nT ′ − (cid:4)(n + 1)∆′(cid:5) − nM ′ = L′ = L′ + P ′ ∼ G′ ≥ 0

where L′ is the pushdown of L, etc. Since nB′ is integral, ⌊(n + 1)∆′⌋ = n∆′, so

nN ′ = −n(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) = −nKX ′ − nT ′ − n∆′ − nM ′ = L′ ∼ nR′ := G′ ≥ 0.

Let B′+ = B′ + R′. Then n(KX ′ + B′+ + M ′) ∼ 0.

By 6.1 (1), it remains to show (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is generalised lc. First we show

which is equivalent to showing R′|S ′ = RS ′. Since

KS ′ + B+

S ′ + MS ′ = (KX ′ + B′+ + M ′)|S ′

nR := G − P + ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ − n∆ ∼ L + ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ − n∆ = nN ∼Q 0/X ′

and since ⌊(n + 1)∆′⌋ − n∆′ = 0 as n∆′ is integral, we get φ∗nR = G′ = nR′ and that R
is the pullback of R′. Now

nRS = GS − PS + ⌊(n + 1)∆S⌋ − n∆S

= (G − P + ⌊(n + 1)∆⌋ − n∆)|S = nR|S

which means RS = R|S, hence RS ′ = R′|S ′.

By generalised inversion of adjunction (3.2), (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is generalised lc near S′. Let

Ω′ := aB′+ + (1 − a)Γ′ and F = (a + (1 − a)α)M

for some a ∈ (0, 1) close to 1. If (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is not generalised lc away from S′, then
(X ′, Ω′ + F ′) is also not generalised lc away from S′. But then KX ′ + Ω′ + F ′ is anti-ample
and its generalised non-klt locus has at least two disjoint components one of which is S′.
This contradicts the connectedness principle (2.7). Thus (X ′, B′+ + M ′) is generalised lc.
(cid:3)

Proposition 6.8. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds
in dimension d. Then Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension d for those (X ′, B′ + M ′) such that

• B′ ∈ R,
• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is not generalised klt, and
• either KX ′ + B′ + M ′ 6∼Q 0 or M ′ 6∼Q 0.

Proof. Step 1. Taking a Q-factorial generalised dlt model of (X ′, B′ + M ′) we can assume
X ′ is Q-factorial and that (X ′, B′) is not klt. Let X ′ → Z ′ be the contraction deﬁned by
−(KX ′ + B′ + M ′). Running an MMP on M ′ over Z ′ and replacing X ′ with the resulting
model we can assume M ′ is nef/Z ′. Note that since the MMP is an MMP on −(KX ′ + B′),
the non-klt property of (X ′, B′) is preserved. Let X ′ → V ′/Z ′ be the contraction deﬁned
by M ′. If dim Z ′ > 0, then dim V ′ > 0. If dim Z ′ = 0, then again dim V ′ > 0 since in this
case M ′ 6∼Q 0. In particular, if M ′ is not big over Z ′, then we can apply Proposition 6.5.

From now on we can assume M ′ is nef and big over Z ′. Then

−(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′) = −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) + (1 − α)M ′

is globally nef and big for some rational number α < 1 close to 1 which will be ﬁxed
throughout the proof. The contraction deﬁned by −(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′) is nothing but
X ′ → V ′. After running an MMP on B′ over V ′ we can assume B′ is nef over V ′, hence

−(KX ′ + βB′ + αM ′) = −(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′) + (1 − β)B′

is also globally nef and big for any rational number β satisfying α ≪ β < 1. Note that
since the latter MMP is KX ′ +B′-trivial, the non-klt property of (X ′, B′) is again preserved.

Step 2. Since X ′ is Fano type and Q-factorial, (X ′, 0) is klt. Thus since (X ′, B′ + M ′)
is generalised lc, (X ′, βB′ + αM ′) is generalised klt. Let (X ′′, B′′) be a Q-factorial dlt
model of (X ′, B′), and let M ′′ be the pullback of M ′. Writing the pullback of KX ′ + βB′
as KX ′′ + ˜B′′, perhaps after increasing β, we can assume the coeﬃcients of B′′ − ˜B′′ are
suﬃciently small. Replacing X ′, B′, M ′ with X ′′, B′′, M ′′ and renaming ˜B′′ to ˜B′, we have:
(X ′, ˜B′ + αM ′) is generalised klt, −(KX ′ + ˜B′ + αM ′) is nef and big, and the coeﬃcients of
B′ − ˜B′ are suﬃciently small. Moreover, every generalised non-klt centre of (X ′, B′ + αM ′)
is a non-klt centre of (X ′, B′): if D is a prime divisor on birational models of X ′ such that
a(D, X ′, B′ + αM ′) = 0, then a(D, X ′, B′) = 0 because

a(D, X ′, B′ + αM ′) = αa(D, X ′, B′ + M ′) + (1 − α)a(D, X ′, B′).

Step 3. Write

−(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′) ∼Q A′ + G′

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

45

where A′, G′ ≥ 0 are Q-divisors and A′ is ample. First assume that Supp G′ does not
contain any generalised non-klt centre of (X ′, B′ + αM ′). Then, for some small δ > 0,

−(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′ + δG′) ∼Q (1 − δ)(

δ

1 − δ

A′ + A′ + G′)

is ample and (X ′, B′ + δG′ + αM ′) is generalised lc whose generalised non-klt locus is equal
to the generalised non-klt locus of (X ′, B′ + αM ′) which is in turn equal to the non-klt
locus of (X ′, B′). Pick a component S′ of ⌊B′⌋ and let Γ′ = S′ + a(B′ − S′ + δG′) for some
a < 1 close to 1. Then (X ′, Γ′ + αM ′) is generalised plt, ⌊Γ′⌋ = S′, and −(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′)
is ample. Now apply Proposition 6.7.

Step 4. From now on we assume that Supp G′ contains some generalised non-klt centre
of (X ′, B′ + αM ′). Let t be the generalised lc threshold of G′ + B′ − ˜B′ with respect to
(X ′, ˜B′ + αM ′) and let Ω′ := ˜B′ + t(G′ + B′ − ˜B′). As (X ′, ˜B′ + αM ′) is generalised klt,
t > 0. We can assume the given morphism φ : X → X ′ is a log resolution of (X ′, B′ + G′).
Write

and

KX + Bα + αM = φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′)

KX + ˜Bα + αM = φ∗(KX ′ + ˜B′ + αM ′)

from which we get Bα − ˜Bα = φ∗(B′ − ˜B′). Perhaps after replacing ˜B′ with b ˜B′ + (1 − b)B′
for some small b > 0, we can assume the coeﬃcients of Bα − ˜Bα are suﬃciently small.

Let G = φ∗G′. Since Supp G′ contains some generalised non-klt centre of (X ′, B′ + αM ′),

we can assume G and ⌊Bα⌋≥0 have a common component, say T . Now

KX + ˜Bα + t(Bα − ˜Bα + G) + αM = φ∗(KX ′ + Ω′ + αM ′).

Since µT ˜Bα is suﬃciently close to µT Bα = 1, we deduce t is suﬃciently small. Moreover,
letting Ω = ˜Bα + t(Bα − ˜Bα + G) we have

Ω ≤ Bα + tG and ⌊Ω⌋≥0 ⊆ ⌊Bα + tG⌋≥0 = ⌊Bα⌋≥0 .

We will use these observations in Step 6.

Step 5. We show that −(KX ′ + Ω′ + αM ′) is ample. By construction

−(KX ′ + ˜B′ + αM ′) = −(KX ′ + B′ + αM ′) + B′ − ˜B′ ∼Q A′ + G′ + B′ − ˜B′.

Thus

−(KX ′ + Ω′ + αM ′) = −(KX ′ + ˜B′ + t(G′ + B′ − ˜B′) + αM ′)

= −(KX ′ + ˜B′ + αM ′) − t(G′ + B′ − ˜B′)
∼Q A′ + G′ + B′ − ˜B′ − t(G′ + B′ − ˜B′)
A′ + A′ + G′ + B′ − ˜B′)

= (1 − t)(

t

1 − t

which is ample.

Step 6. Assume ⌊Ω′⌋ 6= 0 and pick a component S′ of ⌊Ω′⌋. By Step 4, S′ is a component
of ⌊B′⌋. We then deﬁne Γ′ similar to Step 3 by perturbing the coeﬃcients of Ω′, say by
letting Γ′ = S′ + a(Ω′ − S′) for some a < 1 close to 1, so that ⌊Γ′⌋ = S′, (X ′, Γ′ + αM ′) is
generalised plt, and −(KX ′ + Γ′ + αM ′) is ample. Then we apply Proposition 6.7.

Now assume ⌊Ω′⌋ = 0. Let Ω◦ be the sum of the birational transform of Ω′ and the
reduced exceptional divisor of X → X ′. So Ω◦ −Ω is eﬀective and exceptional/X ′. Running

46

Caucher Birkar

an MMP/X ′ on KX + Ω◦ + αM contracts all the components of Ω◦ − Ω as KX + Ω◦ + αM ≡
Ω◦ −Ω/X ′, hence we reach a model X ′′/X ′ such that if Ω′′ and M ′′ are the pushdowns of Ω◦
and M , then (X ′′, Ω′′ + αM ′′) is a Q-factorial generalised dlt model of (X ′, Ω′ + αM ′). The
exceptional prime divisors of X ′′ → X ′ all have coeﬃcient 1 in Ω′′. Moreover, any prime
exceptional divisor D of X → X ′ not contracted over X ′′ is a component of ⌊Ω⌋≥0, hence a
component of ⌊Bα⌋≥0, by Step 4. Thus if B′′ is the pushdown of Bα, then KX ′′ + B′′ + αM ′′
is the pullback of KX ′ + B′ + αM ′ to X ′′, and B′′ is the sum of the birational transform of
B′ and the reduced exceptional divisor of X ′′ → X ′. Since (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised lc,
M ′′ is the pullback of M ′ and KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ is the pullback of KX ′ + B′ + M ′.

Let ˜∆′′ be the sum of the birational transform of ˜B′ and the reduced exceptional divisor
of X ′′ → X ′. Note that ˜∆′′ ≤ Ω′′ and (X ′′, ˜∆′′ + αM ′′) is generalised dlt. Run an MMP/X ′
on KX ′′ + ˜∆′′ + αM ′′. The MMP ends with X ′ because (X ′, ˜B′ + αM ′) is Q-factorial
generalised klt. The last step of the MMP is a divisorial contraction which contracts a
component S′′ of ⌊Ω′′⌋. Abuse notation and replace X ′′ → X ′ with that last contraction.
By construction, (X ′′, ˜∆′′ + αM ′′) is generalised plt and −(KX ′′ + ˜∆′′ + αM ′′) is ample over
X ′. Deﬁning

Γ′′ = a ˜∆′′ + (1 − a)Ω′′

for a suﬃciently small a > 0 we can check that (X ′′, Γ′′+αM ′′) is generalised plt, S′′ = ⌊Γ′′⌋,
and −(KX ′′ + Γ′′ + αM ′′) is globally ample because

−(KX ′′ + Γ′′ + αM ′′) = −a(KX ′′ + ˜∆′′ + αM ′′) − (1 − a)(KX ′′ + Ω′′ + αM ′′)

and because −(KX ′′ + Ω′′ + αM ′′) is the pullback of the ample divisor −(KX ′ + Ω′ + αM ′).
Now apply Proposition 6.7 to KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.9. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds in
dimension d. Then Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension d for those (X ′, B′ + M ′) such that

• B′ ∈ R, and
• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is strongly non-exceptional.

Proof. By assumption there is P ′ ≥ 0 such that KX ′ + B′ + M ′ + P ′ ∼R 0 and (X ′, B′ +
P ′ + M ′) is not generalised lc. In particular, P ′
6= 0. Modifying P ′ we can replace ∼R
with ∼Q. Let t be the generalised lc threshold of P ′ with respect to (X ′, B′ + M ′). Then
t < 1. Let Ω′ = B′ + tP ′ and let (X ′′, Ω′′ + M ′′) be a Q-factorial generalised dlt model
of (X ′, Ω′ + M ′). Let Θ′′ = Ω′′ − tP ′∼ where P ′∼ is the birational transform of P ′. Let π
denote X ′′ → X ′ and let P ′′ be the pullback of P ′. Then Θ′′ ∈ R, X ′′ is Fano type, and

−(KX ′′ + Θ′′ + M ′′) = −(KX ′′ + Ω′′ − tP ′∼ + M ′′)

= tP ′∼ − π∗(KX ′ + Ω′ + M ′) = tP ′∼ − tP ′′ − π∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)

∼Q tP ′∼ + (1 − t)P ′′.

Run an MMP on −(KX ′′ + Θ′′ + M ′′) and let X ′′′ be the resulting model. Since P ′′ ≥ 0
is nef and non-zero, its pushdown P ′′′ 6= 0, hence −(KX ′′′ + Θ′′′ + M ′′′) is nef but 6∼Q 0.
Moreover, since P ′′ is semi-ample, there is Q′′ ≥ 0 such that KX ′′ + Ω′′ + Q′′ + M ′′ ∼Q 0
and (X ′′, Ω′′ + Q′′ + M ′′) is generalised lc. Therefore, (X ′′′, Θ′′′ + M ′′′) is generalised lc but
not generalised klt.

By 6.1 (3), if KX ′′′ +Θ′′′ +M ′′′ has an n-complement KX ′′′ +Θ′′′+ +M ′′′ with Θ′′′+ ≥ Θ′′′,
then KX ′′ + Θ′′ + M ′′ has an n-complement KX ′′ + Θ′′+ + M ′′ with Θ′′+ ≥ Θ′′ which in
turn gives an n-complement KX ′ + B′+ + M ′ of KX ′ + B′ + M ′ with B′+ ≥ B′. Now apply
Proposition 6.8 to KX ′′′ + Θ′′′ + M ′′′.

Lemma 6.10. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds in
dimension d. Then Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension d for those (X ′, B′ + M ′) such that

• B′ ∈ R, and
• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is non-exceptional.

Proof. By assumption there is P ′ ≥ 0 such that KX ′ + B′ + M ′ + P ′ ∼R 0 and (X ′, B′ +
P ′ + M ′) is not generalised klt. Modifying P ′ we can replace ∼R with ∼Q. We can assume
(X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) is generalised lc otherwise (X ′, B′ + M ′) is strongly non-exceptional, so
we can apply Lemma 6.9. Applying the construction in the proof of Lemma 6.9, by taking
t = 1, and replacing (X ′, B′ +M ′) with (X ′′′, Θ′′′ +M ′′′), we can assume (X ′, B′ +M ′) is not
generalised klt and that X ′ is Q-factorial. Applying Proposition 6.8, we can further assume
M ′ ∼Q 0 and that KX ′ + B′ + M ′ ∼Q 0. In particular, KX ′ + B′ ∼Q 0, M = φ∗M ′ ∼Q 0,
and (X ′, B′) is not klt.

Since X ′ is Fano type, Pic(X ′) and Pic(X) are torsion-free (cf. [18, Proposition 2.1.2]).
Therefore, if r is the Cartier index of KX ′ + B′ + M ′, then r(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) ∼ 0, hence
KX ′ + B′ + M ′ is an rp-complement of itself. Thus it is enough to show r is bounded.
Moreover, pM ∼ 0, so pM ′ ∼ 0, hence we only need to show the Cartier index of KX ′ + B′
is bounded.

By Lemma 2.32, there is ǫ ∈ (0, 1) depending only on d, R such that if D is any prime
divisor on birational models of X ′ with a(D, X ′, 0) < ǫ, then a(D, X ′, B′) = 0. Let X ′′ → X ′
be the birational contraction which extracts exactly those D with a(D, X ′, 0) < ǫ. Then
X ′′ is Fano type and ǫ-lc. Moreover, if KX ′′ + B′′ is the pullback of KX ′ + B′, then all the
exceptional divisors of X ′′ → X ′ appear in B′′ with coeﬃcient 1. Replacing (X ′, B′) with
(X ′′, B′′) we can assume X ′ is ǫ-lc. After running an MMP on KX ′ we can assume we have
a Mori ﬁbre structure X ′ → T ′. Applying Proposition 6.5, we can assume dim T ′ = 0, so
X ′ is an ǫ-lc Fano.

By Lemma 6.9, there is a number n depending only on d such that if Y ′ is any strongly
non-exceptional Fano variety of dimension d with klt singularities, then KY ′ has an n-
complement. We can assume pI(R)|n. On the other hand, by Proposition 4.5, there is
m ∈ N depending only on d, ǫ, R such that | − mKX ′| deﬁnes a birational map. Replacing
n once more we can assume m|n. So | − nKX ′| also deﬁnes a birational map. Replacing
φ : X → X ′ we can assume φ∗(−nKX ′) is linearly equivalent to the sum of a general
base point free divisor A and ﬁxed part R. Then n(KX ′ + 1
n A′) ∼ 0. We claim
(X ′, 1
n A′) is lc. If not, then (X ′, 0) is strongly exceptional, hence by our choice of
n we have an n-complement KX ′ + C ′+ of KX ′. Since nC ′+ ∈ | − nKX ′| and (X ′, C ′+) is
lc, we deduce (X ′, 1
n A′) is also lc because A′ + R′ ∈ | − nKX ′| is a general member.
This is a contradiction.

2n R′ and N ′ = 1

2n A′. Since

2n(KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′) ∼ n(KX ′ + B′)

is klt. Let ǫ′ = min{ ǫ
2n }. We claim (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is ǫ′-lc. If not, then there is some
prime divisor D with 0 < a(D, X ′, ∆′ + N ′) < ǫ′. Then either 0 < a(D, X ′, B′) which
implies ǫ ≤ a(D, X ′, B′) by Lemma 2.32, or 0 < a(D, X ′, 1

a contradiction. So (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is ǫ′-lc. Therefore, X ′ belongs to a bounded family by [14,
Corollary 1.7] as the coeﬃcients of ∆′ + N ′ belong to a ﬁxed ﬁnite set, hence the Cartier
index of KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′ is bounded as required.

Now we can assume (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is not klt. Consider this pair as a generalised pair
with data X → X ′ and N = 1
2n A. It is not generalised klt and obviously N ′ 6∼Q 0, hence
by Proposition 6.8, KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′ is an l-complement of itself for some bounded l which
implies the Cartier index of KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′ is at most l.

6.11. Boundedness of complements.
Construction 6.12 Let (X ′, B′ +M ′) be as in Theorem 1.9 and assume X ′ is Q-factorial.
Let ǫ ∈ (0, 1). Since X ′ is Fano type, −KX ′ is big, hence running an MMP on −KX ′ ends
with a model ˜X ′ such that −K ˜X ′ is nef and big. Take a general Q-divisor ˜C ′ ∼Q −K ˜X ′
with coeﬃcient ≤ 1 − ǫ. Let KX ′ + C ′ be the crepant pullback of K ˜X ′ + ˜C ′. Since X ′ 99K ˜X ′
is also the process of an MMP on C ′ and since ˜C ′ ≥ 0, we get C ′ ≥ 0.

Let D be a prime divisor on birational models of X ′ such that a(D, X ′, C ′) < ǫ. We

claim a(D, X ′, B′ + M ′) < ǫ. Indeed if P ′ ∼Q −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is general, then
a(D, X ′, B′ + M ′) = a(D, X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) = a(D, ˜X ′, ˜B′ + ˜P ′ + ˜M ′)

≤ a(D, ˜X ′, 0) = a(D, ˜X ′, ˜C ′) = a(D, X ′, C ′) < ǫ.

Let X ′′ → X ′ be the extraction of all the prime divisors D such that a(D, X ′, C ′) < ǫ. Let
KX ′′ + B′′ + M ′′ be the pullback of KX ′ + B′ + M ′. Then any component of B′′ which
is exceptional/X ′ has coeﬃcient > 1 − ǫ. Also note that if KX ′′ + C ′′ is the pullback of
KX ′ +C ′, then (X ′′, C ′′) is ǫ-lc in codimension at least two, i.e. any D with a(D, X ′′, C ′′) < ǫ
is already a divisor on X ′′.

Now assume ǫ is suﬃciently small, depending only on d, p, R. Let Θ′′ be the boundary
whose coeﬃcients are the same as B′′ except that we replace each coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1)
with 1 (similar to 2.33). That is, Θ′′ = (B′′)≤1−ǫ + ⌈(B′′)>1−ǫ⌉. Run an MMP on −(KX ′′ +
Θ′′ + M ′′) and let X ′′′ be the resulting model. Then we argue that

• (X ′′, Θ′′ + M ′′) is generalised lc,
• the MMP does not contract any component of ⌊Θ′′⌋,
• −(KX ′′′ + Θ′′′ + M ′′′) is nef,
• (X ′′′, Θ′′′ + M ′′′) is generalised lc, and
• X ′′′ is ǫ-lc.
The ﬁrst four claims follow from 2.33. We prove the last claim. Any component of C ′′
with coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1) is a component of B′′ with coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1], hence a
component of ⌊Θ′′⌋, so it is not contracted by the MMP. Thus (X ′′′, C ′′′) is ǫ-lc in codimen-
sion at least two, hence X ′′′ is ǫ-lc. Note that if (X ′′′, Θ′′′ + M ′′′) is generalised klt, then
⌊Θ′′′⌋ = 0, so C ′′′ has no component with coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1) which implies (X ′′′, C ′′′) is
ǫ-lc in any codimension.

Finally, since B′′ ∈ Φ(R) ∪ (1 − ǫ, 1] and since 1 is the only accumulation point of Φ(R),
there is a ﬁnite set T ⊂ [0, 1] of rational numbers which includes R and which depends only
on ǫ, R such that Θ′′ ∈ T (note that by our choice of ǫ, I depends only on d, p, R).

Proposition 6.13. Assume Theorems 1.8 and 1.10 hold in dimension ≤ d. Then Theorem
1.9 holds in dimension d.

Proof. By induction on d we can assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1. Let
(X ′, B′ + M ′) be as in Theorem 1.9 in dimension d. Replacing (X ′, B′ + M ′) with a Q-
factorial generalised dlt model we can assume X ′ is Q-factorial. Pick a suﬃciently small

number ǫ ∈ (0, 1) as in 6.12. We use the notation and constructions of 6.12. If KX ′′′ +
Θ′′′ + M ′′′ has an n-complement KX ′′′ + Θ′′′+ + M ′′′ with Θ′′′+ ≥ Θ′′′, then we get an
n-complement KX ′′ + Θ′′+ + M ′′ of KX ′′ + Θ′′ + M ′′ with Θ′′+ ≥ Θ′′ which in turn gives an
n-complement KX ′ + Θ′+ + M ′ of KX ′ + Θ′ + M ′ with Θ′+ ≥ Θ′ where Θ′ is the pushdown
of Θ′′. Since Θ′ ≥ B′, KX ′ + Θ′+ + M ′ is an n-complement of KX ′ + B′ + M ′. Therefore,
replacing X ′ with X ′′′, B′ with Θ′′′, M ′ with M ′′′, and R with T, we can assume B′ ∈ R
(where T is as in the end of 6.12).

By Lemma 6.10, we can assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional. Since we are assuming
Theorem 1.10 in dimension d, X ′ is bounded. So there is a bounded number n divisible by
pI(R) such that −n(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef and Cartier. Since X ′ is Fano type, we can use
the eﬀective base point free theorem [27], so we can assume −n(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is base
point free. Now let

G′ ∈ | − n(KX ′ + B′ + M ′)|

be a general member and let B′+ = B′ + 1

7. Boundedness of exceptional pairs

The aim of this section is to treat Theorems 1.3 and 1.10 inductively.

7.1. A directed MMP. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective generalised lc pair with data
φ
→ X ′ and M . Assume X ′ is Fano type and −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef. Let D′ ≥ 0 be
X
an R-divisor on X ′ and N a nef R-divisor on X such that D′ + N ′ is R-Cartier and not
numerically trivial. We run an MMP as follows. Let t be the largest number such that

is nef and

−(KX ′ + B′ + tD′ + tN ′ + M ′)

(X ′, B′ + tD′ + tN ′ + M ′)

is generalised lc. Then either t is the generalised lc threshold of D′ + N ′ with respect to
(X ′, B′ + M ′) or there is an extremal ray R such that

(KX ′ + B′ + tD′ + tN ′ + M ′) · R = 0 and (D′ + N ′) · R > 0.

In the former case we stop. In the latter case, if R deﬁnes a Mori ﬁbre structure, we again
stop. Otherwise we perform the ﬂip or divisorial contraction associated to R and continue
the process. That is, in each step we try to increase t keeping the mentioned nefness and
generalised lc properties and we continue until we hit either a generalised lc threshold or a
Mori ﬁbre structure. Note that in each step we have (KX ′ + B′ + M ′) · R ≤ 0. The process
gives an MMP which we refer to as running an MMP for KX ′ + B′ + M ′ by adding multiples
of D′ + N ′. It terminates with some model X ′′. Let ˜t be the maximum of the t appearing
in the process.

We can see from the deﬁnition that the intersection of

KX ′ + B′ + ˜tD′ + ˜tN ′ + M ′

with each extremal ray in the process is nonnegative. Therefore, replacing φ we can assume
the induced map ψ : X 99K X ′′ is a morphism, and that

ψ∗(KX ′′ + B′′ + ˜tD′′ + ˜tN ′′ + M ′′) ≥ φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + ˜tD′ + ˜tN ′ + M ′).

7.2. Bounds on singularities.

Lemma 7.3. Let d, p ∈ N and Φ ⊂ [0, 1] be a DCC set. Then there is a number ǫ >
0 depending only on d, p, Φ satisfying the following. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be a projective
generalised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and M such that

• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional of dimension d,
• B′ ∈ Φ and pM is Cartier, and
• X ′ is Fano type.

Then for any 0 ≤ P ′ ∼R −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′), the pair (X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) is generalised ǫ-lc.
Proof. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) and P ′ be as in the statement. Since (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional,
(X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) is klt. Taking a Q-factorialisation we can assume X ′ is Q-factorial. Let
D′′ be a prime divisor on birational models of X such that a := a(D′′, X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) is
minimal. We can assume a < 1. Let X ′′ → X ′ be the birational contraction which extracts
exactly D′′; it is the identity morphism if D′′ is already a divisor on X ′. Let KX ′′ +B′′ +M ′′
be the pullback of KX ′ + B′ + M ′, and let P ′′ be the pullback of P ′. Let e and c be the
coeﬃcients of D′′ in B′′ and P ′′ respectively (note that it is possible to have e < 0). By
assumption, e + c = 1 − a.

By 2.6 (6), X ′′ is Fano type. Running an MMP on

−(KX ′′ + B′′ + cD′′ + M ′′) ∼Q P ′′ − cD′′ ≥ 0

we get a model X ′′′ on which −(KX ′′′ + B′′′ + cD′′′ + M ′′′) is nef. We can assume the
induced maps ψ : X 99K X ′′ and π : X 99K X ′′′ are morphisms. Then

π∗(KX ′′′ + B′′′ + cD′′′ + M ′′′) ≥ ψ∗(KX ′′ + B′′ + cD′′ + M ′′).

Next run an MMP for KX ′′′ + B′′′ + cD′′′ + M ′′′ by adding multiples of D′′′, as in 7.1.
Let X be the resulting model on which −(KX + B + ˜cD + M ) is nef for some ˜c ≥ c. We
can assume the induced map ρ : X 99K X is a morphism. By construction,
ρ∗(KX + B + ˜cD + M ) ≥ π∗(KX ′′′ + B′′′ + ˜cD′′′ + M ′′′)
≥ ψ∗(KX ′′ + B′′ + cD′′ + M ′′) ≥ φ∗(KX ′ + B′ + M ′).

This implies (X, B + ˜cD + M ) is klt as (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional. So by deﬁnition of the
MMP in 7.1, there is a Mori ﬁbre structure X → T so that
−(KX + B + ˜cD + M ) ≡ 0/T

and D is ample over T . By construction, the coeﬃcients of B − eD belong to Φ. Now
restricting KX + B + ˜cD + M to the general ﬁbres of X → T and applying [7, Theorem 1.5]
shows that e + ˜c is bounded away from 1. This implies e + c is also bounded away from 1.
That is, there is ǫ > 0 depending only on d, p, Φ such that e + c ≤ 1 − ǫ. So ǫ ≤ a, hence
(X ′, B′ + P ′ + M ′) is generalised ǫ-lc.

7.4. From complements to Theorem 1.3.

Lemma 7.5. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds in
dimension d. Then Theorem 1.3 holds in dimension d.

Proof. Assume the statement is not true. Then there is a sequence Xi of exceptional weak
Fano varieties of dimension d such that no inﬁnite subsequence forms a bounded family.
Replacing Xi we can assume they are Fano varieties. Let ǫi be the minimal log discrepancy
of Xi. Let ǫ = lim sup ǫi.

KXi has an n-complement KXi + Bi, by 6.1 (2). Since Xi is exceptional, (Xi, Bi) is klt. So
the Xi form a bounded family by Theorem 1.4, a contradiction.

7.6. Bound on exceptional thresholds.

Lemma 7.7. Let d, p ∈ N and let Φ ⊂ [0, 1] be a DCC set. Then there is β ∈ (0, 1)
depending only on d, p, Φ satisfying the following. Assume (X ′, B′ + M ′) is a projective
generalised pair with data φ : X → X ′ and M such that

• (X ′, B′ + M ′) is exceptional of dimension d,
• B′ ∈ Φ, and pM is Cartier,
• −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is nef, and
• X ′ is Fano type and Q-factorial.

Then (X ′, B′ + αM ′) is exceptional for every α ∈ [β, 1].

Proof. Step 1. Suppose the lemma is not true. Then there exist a strictly increasing
sequence of numbers αi approaching 1 and a sequence (X ′

as in the statement such that (X ′

Step 4. Now run a partial MMP for KX ′′′

i , as in 7.1, by adding multiples
of M ′′′
i , that is, by increasing αi but not exceeding 1. Denote the resulting model by X i,
and assume the process increases αi to ˜αi (so by assumption, ˜αi ≤ 1). If ˜αi = 1 for every
i, then go to Step 5. Otherwise we can assume ˜αi < 1 for every i. By deﬁnition of the
MMP, either ˜αi is the generalised lc threshold of M i with respect to (X i, Γi), or there is
an extremal ray Ri deﬁning a Mori ﬁbre structure X i → T i such that

i

−(KX i + Γi + ˜αiM i) · Ri = 0

and M i · Ri > 0. Since lim ˜αi = 1, we can assume the former case holds for every i, by [7,
Theorem 1.4], which leads to a contradiction by [7, Theorem 1.5] applied to the restriction
of KX i

+ Γi + ˜αiM i to the general ﬁbres of X i → T i.

Step 5. Now we assume ˜αi = 1 for every i which in particular means −(KX i + Γi + M i)

is nef. Assuming the induced map ρi : Xi 99K X i is a morphism, by 7.1, we have

Proposition 7.13. Let d, m, v ∈ N and let tl be a sequence of positive real numbers. Assume
Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8 holds in dimension d. Let P be
the set of projective varieties X such that

(cid:3)

• X is a klt weak Fano variety of dimension d,
• KX has an m-complement,
• | − mKX| deﬁnes a birational map,
• vol(−KX ) ≤ v, and
• for any l ∈ N and any L ∈ | − lKX |, the pair (X, tlL) is klt.

Then P is a bounded family.

Proof. Step 1. Let X ∈ P. Taking a Q-factorialisation we can assume X is Q-factorial.
Let φ : W → X be a resolution so that φ∗(−mKX ) ∼ AW + RW where AW is base point
free and RW is the ﬁxed part. We can assume AW is a general member of |AW |. Let A, R
be the pushdowns of AW , RW . Since KX has an m-complement and since AW is general,
(X, B+ := 1
m R) is lc, hence KX + B+ is also an m-complement. By Theorem 1.4,
we can assume (X, B+) is not klt. The idea is to construct another complement which is
klt. Replacing m we can assume m > 1 so that we can assume A is not a component of ⌊B+⌋.

m A + 1

Step 2. Let ΣW be the sum of the exceptional divisors of φ and the support of the

birational transform of A + R. Then by Lemma 2.30,

KW + ΣW + 2(2d + 1)AW

is big. Moreover its volume is bounded from above because the right hand side of

vol(KX + Σ + 2(2d + 1)A) ≤ vol(KX + A + R + 2(2d + 1)A) ≤ vol(−(4d + 3)mKX )

is bounded from above where Σ is the pushdown of ΣW . Therefore, (W, ΣW ) is log bira-
tionally bounded by [15, Lemmas 3.2 and 2.4.2(4)] as vol(AW ) is bounded. Thus as in Step
7 of the proof of Proposition 4.4, there is a log bounded family Q of log smooth pairs de-
pending only on d, m, v such that, perhaps after replacing W with a higher resolution, there
is (W , ΣW ) ∈ Q and a birational morphism ψ : W → W with ΣW = ψ∗ΣW . Moreover,
letting AW = ψ∗AW we can assume AW = ψ∗AW . Also note that AW ≤ ΣW , so (W , AW )

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

is log bounded. Thus since AW is big, there is l ∈ N depending only on the family Q such
that lAW ∼ GW for some GW ≥ 0 whose support contains ΣW .

W

Step 3. Let KW + B+

be the crepant pullback of KX + B+ to W . Then (W , B+

sub-lc and Supp B+
⊆ ΣW ⊆ Supp GW . Let G = φ∗ψ∗GW . By construction, lA ∼ G,
W
so G + lR ∈ | − lmKX |. Thus, by assumption, (X, t(G + lR)) is klt where t := tlm. In
particular, this means the coeﬃcients of t(G + lR) belong to a ﬁxed ﬁnite set depending
only on t. Decreasing t we can assume it is rational and that t < 1

Now if (X, 1

lm (G + lR)) is lc, then we let Ω = 1

lm (G + lR) and n = lm. But if it is not lc,
then the pair (X, t(G + lR)) is strongly non-exceptional, hence by Lemma 6.9, there is n
depending only on d, t such that there is Ω ≥ t(G+lR) with (X, Ω) is lc and n(KX +Ω) ∼ 0.

7.14. From complements to Theorem 1.10.

Proposition 7.15. Assume Theorem 1.9 holds in dimension ≤ d − 1 and Theorem 1.8
holds in dimension d. Then Theorem 1.10 holds in dimension d.

Proof. Step 1. Let (X ′, B′ + M ′) be as in Theorem 1.10 in dimension d. It is enough to
show X ′ is bounded because then we can ﬁnd a very ample Cartier divisor H ′ so that
−KX ′ · H ′d−1 is bounded, hence B′ · H ′d−1 is bounded too as B′ · H ′d−1 ≤ −KX ′ · H ′d−1,
and this implies (X ′, B′) is log bounded. Taking a Q-factorialisation we can assume X ′
is Q-factorial. By Lemma 7.3, (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised ǫ-lc for some ǫ > 0 depending
only on d, p, R. In particular, the coeﬃcients of B′ belong to a ﬁnite set depending only on
d, p, R because 1 is the only accumulation point of R. Extending R we can assume B′ ∈ R.
Run an MMP on −KX ′ and let ˜X ′ be the resulting model which is a klt weak Fano.
Then K ˜X ′ has an n-complement for some n depending only on d by applying Lemma 7.5 if
˜X ′ is exceptional or by applying Lemma 6.10 otherwise. This implies KX ′ also has an n-
complement KX ′ + C ′, by 6.1 (3). On the other hand, since (X ′, B′ + M ′) is generalised ǫ-lc

56

Caucher Birkar

and −(KX ′ + B′ + M ′) is semi-ample, ˜X ′ is ǫ-lc. Thus by Proposition 4.5, | − mK ˜X ′| deﬁnes
a birational map for some m depending only on d, ǫ, n which in turn implies | − mKX ′| also
deﬁnes a birational map. Replacing both m and n by pmn, we can assume m = n and
that p divides m, n. Moreover, replacing φ and C ′ we can assume C ′ = 1
m R′ where
φ∗(−mKX ′) ∼ A + R with A base point free and R the ﬁxed part.

m A′ + 1

Let ∆′ := 1

2m A. Then (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is generalised lc
and −(KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′) is nef. Note that the coeﬃcients of ∆′ belong to a ﬁxed ﬁnite set
and 2pmN is Cartier.

2m R′ and let N := 1

2 M + 1

Step 2. Assume (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is non-exceptional. Then by Lemma 6.10, KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′
has an l-complement KX ′ + ∆′+ + N ′ for some l depending only on d, p, m, R such that
G′ := ∆′+ − ∆′ ≥ 0. Then

lm(KX ′ + B′ + 2G′ + M ′) ∼ lm(KX ′ + B′ + 2G′ + M ′) + lm(KX ′ + C ′)

is generalised klt, hence exceptional. Now replace B′ with 1
2 M + 1
with 1
that M is big.

2 ∆′+ and replace M
2 N . Replacing p, R accordingly, we can then assume KX ′ + B′ + M ′ ∼Q 0 and

2 B′+ + 1

Step 3. Now assume (X ′, ∆′ + N ′) is exceptional. By Lemma 7.7, there is a rational
number β ∈ (0, 1) depending only on d, p, m, R such that (X ′, ∆′ + βN ′) is exceptional.
Since N = 1

2m A and A is base point free and big, there is r ∈ N such that

2 M + 1

−r(KX ′ + ∆′ + βN ′) = −r(KX ′ + ∆′ + N ′) + r(1 − β)N ′

is integral and potentially birational where r depends only on d, p, m, β, R. Then

|KX ′ − r(KX ′ + ∆′ + βN ′)|

deﬁnes a birational map by [15, Lemma 2.3.4], hence

|mKX ′ − rm(KX ′ + ∆′ + βN ′)|

also deﬁnes a birational map which implies

| − rm(KX ′ + ∆′ + βN ′)| = |mKX ′ + mC ′ − rm(KX ′ + ∆′ + βN ′)|

deﬁnes a birational map as well. In particular, there is ∆′+ ≥ ∆′ such that

rm(KX ′ + ∆′+ + βN ′) ∼ 0.

Since (X ′, ∆′ + βN ′) is exceptional, (X ′, ∆′+ + βN ′) is generalised klt. Now replace B′ and
M with ∆′+ and βN , respectively. Replacing p, R accordingly, from now on we can then
assume KX ′ + B′ + M ′ ∼Q 0 and that M is big.

Step 4. Let ˜X ′ be as in Step 1 which is the result of an MMP on −KX ′. Since KX ′ +
B′ + M ′ ∼Q 0, we can replace X ′ with ˜X ′, hence assume X ′ is a weak Fano. By Step 1,
KX ′ has an m-complement and | − mKX ′| deﬁnes a birational map. Moreover, by Lemma
7.9, vol(−KX ′) ≤ v for some number v depending only on d, p, R. On the other hand, by

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

Lemma 7.11, for each l ∈ N there is a positive real number tl depending only on d, p, l, R
such that for any L′ ∈ | − lKX ′|, the pair (X ′, tlL′) is klt. Therefore, X ′ belongs to a
bounded family by Proposition 7.13.

8. Boundedness of relative complements

In this section we treat Theorem 1.8 inductively. The results of Sections 6 and 7 rely on

this theorem.

Lemma 8.1. Assume Theorems 1.7 and 1.8 hold in dimension d − 1. Then Theorem 1.8
holds in dimension d for those (X, B) and X → Z such that

• B ∈ R,
• (X, Γ) is Q-factorial plt for some Γ,
• −(KX + Γ) is ample over Z,
• S := ⌊Γ⌋ is irreducible and it is a component of ⌊B⌋, and
• S intersects the ﬁbre over z.

Proof. First we claim that if T is the image of S in Z, then the induced morphism S → T
is a contraction. Let f denote X → Z and let π : V → Z denote the ﬁnite part of the Stein
factorisation of S → Z. Then by the properties of Γ and Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing we
have R1f∗OX (−S) = 0 which implies f∗OX → f∗OS is surjective, and this in turn implies
OZ → π∗OV is surjective because OZ = f∗OX and f∗OS = π∗OV . Therefore, V → T is an
isomorphism and S → T is a contraction.

Let KS + BS = (KX + B)|S which is anti-nef over T . By Lemma 3.3, BS ∈ Φ(S) for
some ﬁnite set S ⊂ [0, 1] of rational numbers depending only on R. Moreover, S is Fano
type over T by restricting KX + Γ to S. Therefore, KS + BS has an n-complement KS + B+
S
over z with B+
S ≥ BS, for some n divisible by I(S) and depending only on d, S: this follows
from Theorem 1.7 in dimension d − 1 if dim T = 0 or from Theorem 1.8 in dimension d − 1
if dim T > 0. Replacing n we can assume it is divisible by I(R).

The idea is to lift the complement KS +B+

S to an n-complement KX +B+ of KX +B over
z with B+ ≥ B. This can be proved by closely following the proof of Proposition 6.7 using
the right notation and by working over some open aﬃne neighbourhood of z (and shrinking
it if necessary). The inversion of adjunction and the connectedness principle required at
the end of the proof are well-known in this setting [21][28, Theorem 17.4].

(cid:3)

Proposition 8.2. Assume Theorems 1.7 and 1.8 hold in dimension d − 1. Then Theorem
1.8 holds in dimension d.

Proof. When (X, B) is klt and −(KX + B) is nef and big over Z, the theorem is essentially
[35, Theorem 3.1].

Step 1. Pick an eﬀective Cartier divisor N on Z passing through z. Let t be the lc
threshold of f ∗N with respect to (X, B) over z. Let Ω = B + tf ∗N and let (X ′, Ω′) be a
Q-factorial dlt model of (X, Ω). Then X ′ is Fano type over Z. There is ∆′ ≤ Ω′ such that
∆′ ∈ Φ(R), some component of ⌊∆′⌋ is vertical over Z intersecting the ﬁbre over z, and
B ≤ ∆ where ∆ is the pushdown of ∆′. Run an MMP/Z on −(KX ′ + ∆′) and let X ′′ be
the resulting model. Since −(KX ′ + ∆′) = −(KX ′ + Ω′) + (Ω′ − ∆′) is pseudo-eﬀective over
Z, the MMP ends with a minimal model, that is, −(KX ′′ + ∆′′) is nef over Z. Moreover,
if KX ′′ + ∆′′ has an n-complement KX ′′ + ∆′′+ over z with ∆′′+ ≥ ∆′′, then KX ′ + ∆′ has
an n-complement KX ′ + ∆′+ over z with ∆′+ ≥ ∆′ which in turn implies KX + B also has

58

Caucher Birkar

an n-complement KX + B+ over z with B+ ≥ B. Since −(KX ′ + Ω′) is semi-ample over Z,
(X ′′, Ω′′) is lc, hence (X ′′, ∆′′) is lc. Replacing (X, B) with (X ′′, ∆′′) we can assume ⌊B⌋
has a component intersecting the ﬁbre over z.

Step 2. Let ǫ > 0 be a suﬃciently small number. Let Θ be the boundary whose coeﬃ-
cients are the same as B except that we replace each coeﬃcient in (1 − ǫ, 1) with 1. Run
an MMP/Z on −(KX + Θ) and let X ′ be the resulting model. Arguing as in 2.33, one can
show we can choose ǫ depending only on d, R so that no component of ⌊Θ⌋ is contracted by
the MMP, (X ′, Θ′) is lc, and that −(KX ′ + Θ′) is nef over Z. Moreover, the coeﬃcients of
Θ′ belong to some ﬁxed ﬁnite set depending only on R, ǫ. If KX ′ + Θ′ has an n-complement
KX ′ + Θ′+ over z with Θ′+ ≥ Θ′, then KX + Θ has an n-complement KX + Θ+ over z with
Θ+ ≥ Θ which in turn implies KX + B also has an n-complement KX + B+ over z with
B+ ≥ B. Replacing (X, B) with (X ′, Θ′) and extending R, from now on we can assume
B ∈ R. In the following steps we try to mimic the arguments of the proof of Proposition 6.8.

Step 3. Since X is Fano type over Z, −KX is big over Z. So since −(KX + B) is nef

over Z,

−(KX + αB) = −α(KX + B) − (1 − α)KX

is big over Z for any α ∈ (0, 1). We will assume α is suﬃciently close to 1. Deﬁne a
boundary ∆ as follows. Let D be a prime divisor. If D is vertical over Z, let µD∆ = µDB
but if D is horizontal over Z, let µD∆ = µDαB. Then (X, ∆) is lc, αB ≤ ∆ ≤ B, ⌊∆⌋ has
a component intersecting the ﬁbre over z, and −(KX + ∆) is big over Z as ∆ = αB near
the generic ﬁbre.

Let X → V /Z be the contraction deﬁned by −(KX + B). Run an MMP on −(KX + ∆)
over V and let X ′ be the resulting model. Perhaps after replacing α with a larger number,
we can assume −(KX ′ +∆′) is nef and big over Z. Replace (X, B) with (X ′, B′) and replace
∆ with ∆′ so that we can assume −(KX + ∆) is nef and big over Z. Let X → T /Z be the
contraction deﬁned by −(KX + ∆).

Let ˜∆ = β∆ for some β < 1. After running an MMP on −(KX + ˜∆) over T we can
assume −(KX + ˜∆) is nef and big over T , hence also nef and big over Z if we replace β
with a number suﬃciently close to 1. Taking a Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B), increasing
α, β if necessary, and replacing KX + ∆ and KX + ˜∆ with their pullbacks we can assume
(X, B) is Q-factorial dlt and that there are boundaries ˜∆ ≤ ∆ ≤ B so that −(KX + ∆)
and −(KX + ˜∆) are nef and big over Z, some component of ⌊∆⌋ intersects the ﬁbre over
z, and that (X, ˜∆) is klt.

Step 4. We can write −(KX + ∆) ∼R A + G/Z where A ≥ 0 is ample and G ≥ 0. Assume
Supp G does not contain any non-klt centre of (X, ∆). Let δ > 0 be suﬃciently small. Since

−(KX + ∆ + δG) ∼R (1 − δ)(

δ

1 − δ

A + A + G)/Z

is ample over Z, by perturbing the coeﬃcients of ∆ + δG we can ﬁnd a boundary Γ such
that (X, Γ) is plt, S := ⌊Γ⌋ ⊆ ⌊B⌋ is irreducible intersecting the ﬁbre over z, and −(KX +Γ)
is ample over Z. So we can apply Lemma 8.1.

Now assume Supp G contains some non-klt centre of (X, ∆). Let t be the lc threshold of
G + ∆ − ˜∆ with respect to (X, ˜∆) over z. Replacing ∆ we can assume ∆ − ˜∆ is suﬃciently
small, hence t is suﬃciently small too. Then letting Ω = ˜∆ + t(G + ∆ − ˜∆), any non-klt

Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties

59

centre of (X, Ω) is a non-klt centre of (X, ∆). By construction,

−(KX + Ω) = −(KX + ˜∆ + t(G + ∆ − ˜∆))

= −(KX + ∆) + ∆ − ˜∆ − t(G + ∆ − ˜∆))

∼R A + G − tG + (1 − t)(∆ − ˜∆)

= (1 − t)(

t

1 − t

A + A + G + ∆ − ˜∆)/Z

which implies −(KX + Ω) is ample over Z because

−(KX + ˜∆) = −(KX + ∆) + ∆ − ˜∆ ∼R A + G + ∆ − ˜∆/Z

is nef and big over Z.

Step 5. If ⌊Ω⌋ 6= 0, then there is a component S of ⌊Ω⌋ ⊆ ⌊B⌋ and there is a boundary
Γ so that (X, Γ) is plt, S = ⌊Γ⌋ intersects the ﬁbre over z, and −(KX + Γ) is ample over
Z. So we can apply Lemma 8.1.

Now assume ⌊Ω⌋ = 0. As in Step 6 of the proof of 6.8 we can assume there is a projective
birational contraction X ′ → X from a Q-factorial variety such that it contracts only one
divisor S′ which intersects the ﬁbre over z, (X ′, S′) is plt, −(KX ′ + S′) is ample over X,
and if we denote the pullbacks of KX + Ω and KX + ∆ by KX ′ + Ω′ and KX ′ + ∆′, then S′
is a component of both ⌊Ω′⌋ and ⌊∆′⌋. Now since −(KX + Ω) is ample over Z, we can ﬁnd
a boundary Γ′ so that (X ′, Γ′) is plt, S′ = ⌊Γ′⌋ intersects the ﬁbre over z, and −(KX ′ + Γ′)
is ample over Z. In addition, if KX ′ + B′ is the pullback of KX + B, then S′ is a component
of ⌊B′⌋. Now apply Lemma 8.1 to .

(cid:3)

9. Anti-canonical volume

In this section we prove Theorem 1.6 which claims that the anti-canonical volumes of ǫ-lc
Fano varieties of a given dimension are bounded. Recall that we proved this boundedness for
exceptional Fano varieties in 7.9. To deal with the non-exceptional case we need Conjecture
1.5 in lower dimension.

Proof. (of Theorem 1.6) Step 1. The birational boundedness claim follows from existence of
v and Theorem 1.2, eg as in Step 7 of the proof of 4.4. If there is no v as in the statement,
then there is a sequence Xi of ǫ-lc Fano varieties of dimension d such that vol(−KXi) is an
increasing sequence approaching ∞. We will derive a contradiction. Fix ǫ′ ∈ (0, ǫ). Then
there exist a decreasing sequence of rational numbers ai approaching 0, and Q-boundaries
Bi ∼Q −aiKXi such that (2d)d < vol(Bi) and (Xi, Bi) is ǫ′-lc but not ǫ′′-lc for any ǫ′′ > ǫ′.
We can assume ai < 1, hence −(KXi + Bi) is ample. Thus for each i, there is a prime
divisor D′
i is a divisor on Xi,
then we let φi : X ′
i → Xi to be a small Q-factorialisation, otherwise we let it be a birational
contraction which extracts only D′
i KXi
i = 1 − ǫ′. Therefore, the
and let KX ′
coeﬃcient of D′

i on birational models of Xi such that a(D′

Step 2. Let Hi be a general ample Q-divisor so that KXi +Bi +Hi ∼Q 0 and (Xi, Bi +Hi)
i which ends with a Mori

In particular, lim si = ∞.

i ≥ bi(ǫ − ǫ′). So there is a number si ≥ bi(ǫ − ǫ′) so that KX ′′

+ siD′′

i ∼Q 0/Zi.

i

Assume dim Zi > 0 for every i and let Vi be a general ﬁbre of X ′′

i → Zi. Since we are
assuming Conjecture 1.5 in dimension ≤ d − 1, Vi belongs to a bounded family as it is an
ǫ′-lc Fano variety. Restricting to Vi we get KVi + siDVi ∼Q 0 where DVi = D′′
i |Vi. This
contradicts Lemma 2.11.

From now on we can assume dim Zi = 0 for every i. By construction,

vol(−KX ′′

i

) ≥ vol(biP ′′

i ) ≥ vol(biP ′

i ) = vol(biBi) > (2bid)d.

Replacing ǫ with ǫ′ and replacing Xi with X ′
i we can assume there is a prime divisor Di on
Xi such that KXi + siDi ∼Q 0 and that the si form an increasing sequence approaching ∞.

Step 3. In this step we ﬁx i. By 2.16 (2), there is a bounded covering family of subvarieties
of Xi such that for any pair of general closed points xi, yi ∈ Xi there exist a member Gi
of the family and a Q-divisor 0 ≤ ∆i ∼Q −aiKXi so that (Xi, ∆i) is lc at xi with a unique
non-klt place whose centre contains xi, that centre is Gi, and (Xi, ∆i) is not lc at yi. As
−(KXi + ∆i) is ample, dim Gi 6= 0 by the connectedness principle.

Let Fi be the normalisation of Gi, and let F ′

99K Wi is
a morphism. By Theorem 3.9, there is a Q-boundary ΘFi with coeﬃcients in a ﬁxed DCC
set Φ depending only on d such that we can write

i → Fi be a resolution so that F ′
i

(KXi + ∆i)|Fi ∼Q KFi + ∆Fi := KFi + ΘFi + PFi

where PFi is pseudo-eﬀective. Increasing ai and adding to ∆i we can assume Pi ≥ 0.

Let DFi := Di|Fi. By Lemma 3.10, each component of DFi has coeﬃcient at least 1 in
ΘFi +DFi. Replacing ∆i with ∆i +Di and replacing PFi with PFi +DFi, we can assume each
component of DFi := Di|Fi has coeﬃcient at least 1 in ∆Fi. Note that we also need to re-
place ai with ai + 1
which we still can assume to form a decreasing sequence approaching 0.
si

Step 4. Pick a rational number ǫ′ ∈ (0, ǫ). By construction, (Fi, ∆Fi) is not ǫ′-lc. Deﬁne
i as follows. Let Si be a prime divisor and let vi be its coeﬃcient in
is the pullback of KFi + ∆Fi. If vi ≤ 0, then let the coeﬃcient of Si
be the minimum of vi and

be zero. But if vi > 0, then let the coeﬃcient of Si in ΣF ′

10. Proofs of main results

Recall that we proved Theorem 1.4 in Section 5 and proved Theorem 1.6 in Section
9. We prove the other main results by induction so lets assume all the theorems in the
introduction hold in dimension d − 1. They can be veriﬁed easily in dimension 1.

Proof. (of Theorem 1.8) This follows from Theorems 1.7 and 1.8 in dimension d − 1, and
Proposition 8.2.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 1.3) This follows from Theorem 1.9 in dimension ≤ d − 1, Theorem 1.8
in dimension d, and Lemma 7.5.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 1.10) This follows from Theorem 1.9 in dimension ≤ d − 1, Theorem
1.8 in dimension d, and Proposition 7.15.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 1.9) This follows from Theorems 1.8 and 1.10 in dimension d, and
Proposition 6.13.

Proof. (of Theorem 1.7) This is a special case of Theorem 1.9.

Proof. (of Theorem 1.1) This is a consequence of Theorem 1.7.
