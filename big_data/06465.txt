On noise-induced synchronization and consensus

of nonlinear network systems under input

disturbances

Giovanni Russo ∗

Abstract

This paper is concerned with the study of synchronization and consen-
sus phenomena in complex networks of diﬀusively-coupled nodes subject
to external disturbances. Speciﬁcally, we make use of stochastic Lyapunov
functions to provide conditions for synchronization and consensus for net-
works of nonlinear, diﬀusively coupled nodes, where noise diﬀusion is not
just additive but it depends on the nodes’ state. The suﬃcient condition
we provide, wich links together network topology, coupling strength and
noise diﬀusion, oﬀers two interesting interpretations. First, as suggested
by intuition, in order for a network to achieve synchronization/consensus,
its nodes need to be suﬃciently well connected together. The second impli-
cation might seem, instead, counter-intuitive: if noise diﬀusion is properly
designed, then it can drive an unsynchronized network towards synchro-
nization/consensus. Motivated by our current research in Smart Cities
and Internet of Things, we illustrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach by
showing how our results can be used to control certain collective decision
processes.

1 Introduction

Over the past years, the study of synchronization and consensus of multiple
interconnected systems has received considerable attention from both the Con-
trol and Physics communities, [4], [15], [3]. This interest has been primarily

motivated by the many potential applications of synchronization and consen-
sus, which span from rendezvous [25] to distributed optimization [7], [30], power
networks [6] and biochemical systems analysis/control [24].

Over the past few years, several suﬃcient conditions have been devised en-
suring, under diﬀerent technical assumptions and using diﬀerent approaches,
synchronization/consensus of complex networks. Examples of such approaches
include passivity-based techniques [2], input-output stability [27], Lyapunov
techniques [12], convergent systems [18], incremental stability, [8], contraction
theory [26] and the Master Stability Function(mainly used within the Physics
Community) [19]. An assumption that is often made in Literature is that the
network of interest is noise-free. This assumption is not realistic for most real
world applications of synchronization and consensus, where noise plays a key
role in destroying or generating those coordinated behaviors. A class of net-
works where noise cannot be neglected is the one where the network nodes
interact with the environment. Such networks are relevant to many applica-
tions in Nature and Technology, with examples ranging from synchronization
of biochemical reactions to coordination of smart devices connected over the
Internet of Things (IoT).

This paper is concerned with the study of synchronization and consensus in
networks where nodes interact with the external environment. This interaction
results in a perturbation of the nodes’ intrinsic dynamics by some external
(white) noise. Speciﬁcally, we will consider networks where nodes’ dynamics
are nonlinear and where the diﬀusion of noise depends on the nodes’ state.
By using stochastic Lyapunov techniques [16], we present a suﬃcient condition
ensuring that the network synchronizes (or achieves consensus) in the presence
of the external noise. We will also show that our condition, which links together
network topology, coupling strength, node and diﬀusion dynamics, has to two
interesting interpretations. First, as expected, the condition implies that in
order for the network to achieve synchronization/consensus, the nodes need
to be strongly connected together so as to overcome a threshold generated by
noise. On the other hand, our result also oﬀers a perhaps counter-intuitive
interpretation as it shows that, under certain assumptions, noise drives the
network to achieve synchronization and consensus. In turn, this implies that, if
properly designed, noise can be turned into a distributed control input to induce
synchronization/consensus.

The paper is organized as follows. We start with introducing the notation
and mathematical preliminaries in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we formalize
the problem statement while, in Section 4, we provide a suﬃcient condition for
network synchronization/consensus. Finally, in Section 5, we apply our result
to study collective decision processes.

Related Work

The problem of analyzing/controlling synchronization and consensus in continuous-
time networks aﬀected by noise is attracting many researchers. For example,
recently, in [31], the consensus problem has been studied for a network of in-

2

tegrators when the information exchanged between nodes is corrupted by some
white noise. Also, in [29], a similar model (i.e.
the so-called drift-diﬀusion
model, DDM) is used to study the dynamics of collective decision processes. In
order to devise their results, in such papers it is assumed that the noise aﬀect-
ing each node is additive with constant diﬀusion rate and that the dynamics
at the network nodes are linear 1-dimensional systems or integrators. Recently,
the assumptions on the nodes’ dynamics have been relaxed in [33]. Speciﬁcally,
in this paper, an approach to study synchronization in networks of nonlinear
nodes subject to additive noise has been presented. However, in order to obtain
their results, the authors recast the synchronization problem as a stochastic
optimization problem and then apply numerical methods to solve it. Interest-
ingly, a large body of literature is emerging which is devoted to study network
dynamics when the external disturbance acting on the nodes is not a white
noise but it is rather the output of some exogenous system, see e.g.
[20] and
[32]. In this case, as shown in e.g.
[14] (see also references therein), nonlinear
nodes’ dynamics can be considered, with the external disturbance aﬀecting the
dynamics via some possibly nonlinear function.

2 Mathematical Preliminaries

2.1 Notation

In this paper, we will denote with In the n×n identity matrix and with 1n×m the
n × m matrix having all of its elements equal to 1. The vector/matrix Frobenius
norm will be denoted with k·kF and the vector/matrix Euclidean norm will be
denoted with |·|. The trace of a square matrix, say A, will be denoted with
tr {A}. Finally, we will denote by M the n-dimensional subspace spanned by
the vector 1n.

2.2 Stochastic diﬀerential equations

Consider an n-dimensional stochastic diﬀerential equation of the form

dx = f (t, x)dt + g(t, x)dB,

(1)

where: (i) x ∈ Rn is the state variable; (ii) f : R+ × Rn → Rn belongs to C 2; (iii)
g : R+ × Rn → Rn×d belongs to C; (iv) B = [B1, . . . , Bd]T is a d-dimensional
Brownian motion. Throughout this paper we will assume that both f and g
obey the local Lipschitz condition and the linear growth condition, see e.g. [17].
This implies that for any given initial condition x(t0) = x0, t ≥ 0, equation (1)
has a unique global solution. We will also assume that f (t, 0) = g(t, 0) = 0 and
the solution x = 0 will be said the trivial solution of (1).

Following [13], [23], we say that a sequence of stochastic variables, {V1, V2, . . .}

converges almost surely (a.s.) to the stochastic variable V if

P(cid:18)(cid:26)w :

lim

n→+∞

Vn(w) = V (w)(cid:27)(cid:19) = 1.

3

That is, the sequence converges to V with probability 1. We are now ready to
give the following deﬁnition which characterizes stability of the trivial solution,
see [16].

Deﬁnition 1. The trivial solution of (1) is said to be almost surely exponentially
stable if for all x ∈ Rn, limt→+∞ sup 1

t log (|x(t)|) < 0, a.s..

Let V (t, x) : R+ × Rn → R+, V (t, x) ∈ C 1×2, i.e. V (t, x) is twice diﬀeren-
tiable with respect to x and diﬀerentiable with respect to t. By the Ito formula
we have:

dV (t, x) = LV (t, x)dt + Vx(t, x)g(t, x)dB,

where: (i) LV (t, x) = Vt(t, x)+Vx(t, x)f (t, x)+ 1
Vx = [Vx1, . . . , Vxn ]; (iii) Vxx is the n × n dimensional matrix having as element
ij Vxixj (where Vxi := ∂V (t, x)/∂xi and Vxixj := ∂ 2V (t, x)/∂xj∂xi). In the rest
of the paper we assume that the diﬀusion function g(t, x) is linear in x. The
following result from [16] provides a suﬃcient condition for the trivial solution
of (1) to be almost surely exponentially stable.

2 tr(cid:8)g(t, x)T Vxxg(t, x)(t, x)(cid:9);(ii)

Theorem 1. Assume that there exists a non-negative function V (t, x) ∈ C 1×2
and constants p > 0, c1 > 0, c2 ∈ R, c3 ≥ 0, such that ∀x 6= 0 and ∀t ∈ R+:
(H1) c1 |x|p ≤ V (t, x)p; (H2) LV (t, x) ≤ c2V (t, x); (H3) |Vx(t, x)g(t, x)|2 ≥
c3V (t, x)2. Then: limt→+∞ sup 1
, a.s.. In particular, if
c3 > 2c2, then the trivial solution of (1) is almost surely exponentially stable.

t log (|x(t)|) ≤ − c3−2c2

2.3 Complex networks

Throughout this paper, we will consider systems interacting over some graph,
G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices (or nodes in what follows) and E is the
set of edges. We assume all the graphs in this paper are undirected and denote
the edge between node i and node j as (i, j). We will denote with Ni the set of
neighbors of node i, i.e. Ni := {j : (i, j) ∈ E}. Let N be the number of nodes in
the network. Then (see e.g. [9]) the Laplacian matrix associated to the graph,
L, is the N × N symmetric matrix deﬁned as L = ∆ − A, where: (i) A is the
adjacency matrix of G; (ii) ∆ is the graph degree matrix. The following Lemma
from [11] will be used in this paper.

Lemma 1. Denote with L the Laplacian matrix of an undirected network. The
following properties hold: (i) L has a simple zero eigenvalue and all the other
eigenvalues are positive if and only if the network is connected; (ii) the eigen-
vector associated to the zero eigenvalue is 1N , i.e.
the N -dimensional vector
having all of its elements equal to 1; (iii) the smallest nonzero eigenvalue, λ2,
satisﬁes λ2 = minvT 1N =0,v6=0

vT Lv
vT v .

In the rest of this paper, λ2 will be termed as the graph algebraic connec-

tivity.

3 Problem statement

Throughout this paper, we will consider stochastic networks described by the
following stochastic diﬀerential equation:

dxi = 


f (t, xi) + σ Xj∈Ni

(xj − xi)


dt + g(t, xi)db,

i = 1, . . . , N,

where: (i) xi ∈ Rn; (ii) f (t, xi) : R+ × Rn → Rn is the smooth nominal
nodes dynamics; (iii) σ is the coupling strength; (iv) b(t) ∈ R is the standard
Brownian process describing the environmental noise acting on the network; (v)
g(t, X) : R+ × RnN → Rn is the smooth n-dimensional vector modeling how the
environmental noise diﬀusesn to the network. Note that network dynamics can
be written in compact form as follows:

dx = [F (t, X) − σ(L ⊗ In)X] dt + G(t, X)db,

(2)

with:

• x = [xT

1 , . . . , xT

N ]T ;

• F (t, X) = [f (t, x1)T , . . . , f (t, xN )T ]T ;

• G(t, X) = [g(t, x1)T , . . . , g(t, xN )T ]T .

The goal of this paper is to address the so-called synchronization problem.

This is formalized with the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2. Let s(t) = 1
stochastic synchronization if

N PN

j=1 xj(t). We will say that network (2) achieves

lim

t→+∞

sup

1
t

log (|xi(t) − s(t)|) < 0

a.s. ∀i = 1, . . . , N.

That is, stochastic synchronization essentially means that all the network
nodes converge towards a synchronous solution that averages the noise diﬀusion
within the network. Also, note that in the case where nodes’ dynamics are
integrator dynamics, then the deﬁnition of stochastic synchronization simply
becomes a deﬁnition for consensus.

A discussion on the model

Equations similar to (2) naturally arise when modeling networked systems from
IoT and biochemical applications. For example, as outlined in Figure 1 (top
panel), IoT applications are typically deployed by interconnecting a number of
smart devices. Each device of the networked system consists of some intrinsic
agent dynamics, which is controlled by a local control algorithm. Typically, the
control algorithm also takes information/data from the external environment

5

and this leads the controller to be aﬀected by an environmental noise. This is
the case of many complex cyber-physical systems, [1], with applications rang-
ing from the coordination of team of quadricopters, [10], to supervisory human
control, [21] and decision-making processes, [29]. Another important instance
where equations similar to (2) arise is when the agents of a networked system are
made up by a number of compartments (see the bottom panel of Figure 1), with
one of the compartments being aﬀected by an external noise. These compart-
mental models are widely used in pharmacology and many other biochemical
applications. For examples, for a biochemical network, each of the compart-
ments might be a subset of biochemical reactions or even macro-systems, like
an organ or blood, [28].

The two classes of networked systems described above can be recast into
equations of the form (2). Speciﬁcally, the function f (t, xi) would model the
noise free component of the i-th agent in a networked system (i.e. the dynamics
of a device or the noise-free compartment ofa compartmental system), while the
function g(xi) would model the sub-components of the nodes’ dynamics which
are aﬀected by the external noise (i.e. the i-th local controller taking inputs
from the external world or a compartment of a compartmental system which is
aﬀected by environmental noise).

4 A suﬃcient condition for stochastic synchro-

nization

Let S = 1n ⊗ s(t). The following result provides a suﬃcient condition ensuring
stochastic synchronization of network (2).

Theorem 2. Assume that the following conditions hold for network (2):

1. there exists some constant, say Kf , such that

(X − Y )T [F (t, X) − F (t, Y )] ≤ Kf (X − Y )T (X − Y ),

, ∀X, Y ∈ RN n, ∀t ∈ R+;

2. there exists some constant, say KG, such that

|G(t, X) − G(t, Y )| ≤ KG |X − Y | ,

∀X, Y ∈ RN n, ∀t ∈ R+;

3. there exists some constant, say ¯KG, such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(X − Y )T (G(t, X) − G(t, Y ))(cid:12)(cid:12)

∀X, Y ∈ RN n, ∀t ∈ R+;

From (2) and (3) we can then get the stochastic diﬀerential equation for e =
X − S. Namely:

where:

de = h ˜F (t, e)i dt +h ˜G(t, e)i db,

(4)

• ˜F (t, e) = F (t, e + S) − σLX − 1

N (1N ×N ⊗ In)F (t, e + S);

• ˜G(t, e) = G(t, e + S) − G(t, S).

Now, note that e = 0 is the trivial solution for (4). In fact:

F (t, S) −

1N ×N F (t, S) = 0,

and, at the same time, ˜G(t, 0) = 0. This means that we can use Theorem 1 to

show network synchronization. To this aim, let V (t, e) = V (e) = 1
Theorem 1 we need to show that there exists c2 ∈ R, c3 ≥ 0, such that c3 > 2c2.

In order to compute the term LV (e), ﬁrst note that Vt(e) = 0. Let’s now

In order to prove this, we will now estimate LV (e) and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
compute the term Ve(e) ˜F (t, e). We have:
Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) = eT (cid:20)F (t, e + S) − σ(L ⊗ In)(e + S) −

and by adding and subtracting F (t, S) = 1N ⊗ f (t, s) we get

Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) =

(1N ×N ⊗ In)F (t, e + S)(cid:21) .

(1N ×N ⊗ In)F (t, e + S)(cid:21) = 0,

while:

Thus:

That is,

Now:

−σ(L ⊗ In)(e + S) = −σ(L ⊗ In)e.

Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) = eT [F (t, e + S) − F (t, S) − σ(L ⊗ In)e] .

Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) = eT [F (t, e + S) − F (t, S)] − σeT (L ⊗ In)e.

Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) ≤

where the last equality follows from Lemma 1. Finally, by hypothesis 1, we have
that

Ve(e) ˜F (t, e) ≤ (Kf − σλ2) eT e = 2 (Kf − σλ2) V (e).

(6)

The next step to estimate LV (e) is that of computing the term

trn ˜G(t, e + S)T Vee ˜G(t, e + S)o .

Since Vee(e) = 1, such a condition simply becomes: 1
Also, recall that for any matrix, say A, we have kAk2

2 trn ˜G(t, e + S)T ˜G(t, e + S)o.
F = tr(cid:8)AT A(cid:9) and thus:
= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
˜G(t, e + S)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

= (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
˜G(t, e + S)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)F

where the last inequality follows from the fact that for any vector, say a, kakF =
|a|. Now, by hypothesis 2, we have:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜G(t, e + S)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and therefore we have:

= |G(t, e + S) − G(t, S)| ≤ KG |e| ,

Remarks on Theorem 2

• Hypothesis 1 is sometimes known in the literature as QUAD. As shown
in [5], this condition can be linked to Lipschitz and contraction conditions
of the vector ﬁeld, [], []. Speciﬁcally, in this latter case, this would imply
Kf < 0;

• Hypothesis 2 implies that the noise diﬀusion is bounded. Note that, by
assumption, the function g(t, x) is linear in X and therefore there exists
some n × n matrix, say Mg(t), such that g(t, x) := Mg(t)x. Hence, the
function G(t, X) can be expressed as G(t, X) := MG(t)X, where MG(t) is
the nN ×nN block-diagonal matrix having on its main diagonal the matri-
ces Mg(t). Now, Hypothesis 2 of Theorem 2 can be characterized in therms
of the eigenvalues of the matrix Mg(t). Speciﬁcally, let λmax(MG(t)) and
λmax(Mg(t)) be the largest (time-varying) eigenvalue of MG(t) and Mg(t),
respectively. Then:

|G(t, X) − G(t, y)| = |MG(t)(X − Y )| ≤ λmax(MG(t)) |X − Y | ,

where the last inequality follows from the fact that MG(t) is a block diag-
onal matrix. Therefore, we have that KG = maxt {λmax(Mg(t))};

• while Hypothesis 3 allows the noise to be persistent. Again, such a con-
dition can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of Mg(t). Speciﬁ-
cally, it can be shown that in this case ¯KG := mint {λmin(Mg(t))}, where
λmin(Mg(t)) is the smaller eigenvalue of Mg(t);

• Finally, Hypothesis 4 links together the algebraic connectivity of the net-
work graph and coupling strength between nodes. Speciﬁcally, such a
condition implies that synchronization is attained if σλ2 > ˜K := Kf +
K 2
. The threshold ˜K depends on the dynamics of the node on noise.

Interestingly, this hypothesis is implying that noise can potentially be
helpful for synchronization. Speciﬁcally, if 2 ¯K 2
g , then the eﬀect of
noise is that of lowering ˜K, thus helping synchronization rather than being
disruptive. We will build upon this idea in Section 5, where we will show
that a common opinion among a set of agent can be forced by inducing a
noise of suﬃciently high intensity within the network.

5 An application: inducing a collective decision

through noise

The problem we consider in this Section is that of understanding whether a
population of interconnected agents which are aﬀected by some external distur-
bance is able to achieve a common decision. Recently, this problem has become
particularly relevant in IoT applications when, based on the local collection of
data (observations), a group of diﬀusively coupled objects, with possibly diﬀer-
ing likelihoods, is in charge of detecting the occurrence of a given event among
two alternatives. This networked system can be modeled with the following
diﬀerential equation:

˙xi = x∗

i − x3

i + Xj∈Ni

(xj − xi),

and ﬁnding conditions for the onset of a collective decision is equivalent to
devising synchronization conditions for the network above. In such a network,
the intrinsic dynamics of the nodes is a bistable system (i.e. x∗
i ) and nodes
are diﬀusively coupled.
In the equation above, the intrinsic dynamics of the
nodes is perturbed by some external white noise, w(t) and, in particular, the
term x∗
i consists of a noise-
free component, rxi, and of a term which is aﬀected by noise and hence acts
as a perturbation on the node dynamics. The equation above can be therefore
recast as the following stochastic diﬀerential equation:

i can be decomposed as rxi + σnxiw(t). That is, x∗

i − x3

dxi = 
rxi − x3


i + Xj∈Ni

(xj − xi)


dt + [σnxi] db.

(10)

Equations similar to (10) also arise in the context of the study of human
performance in a two alternative decision making process. Speciﬁcally, the for-
mation process of an individual can be modeled by the Drift Diﬀusion Model
(DDM), see e.g. [22], [21] and references therein: dx = βdt + σdB, where β ∈ R
is the drift rate, σ > 0 is the diﬀusion rate and x(t) is the opinion at time t.
Recently, in the remarkable work [29] the DDM has been extended to study
collective decisions. In order to do so, the authors used the coupled version of

the DDM: dxi = hβ +Pj∈Ni

(xj − xi)i dt + σbdbi, where: (i) xi is the aggregate

evidence of the i-th agent in the network; (ii) dbi models the (external) noise

11

aﬀecting the data collected by i-th agent; (iii) σb models the strength of noise
diﬀusion on each network node.

We will now use Theorem 2 to study the eﬀects of noise on the capability of
network (10) to achieve a common decision. The ﬁrst step to apply Theorem 2
is to compute the parameters Kf , KG and ¯KG.

Computation of Kf : this parameter can be computed by noticing that
(x − y)(f (x) − f (y)) = (x − y)(r(x − y) − (x3 − y3)) and therefore (x − y)(f (x) −
f (y)) ≤ r(x − y)2. That is, Kf = r.

Computation of KG and ¯KG: note that |G(t, X) − G(t, y)| = |MG(X − Y )|,

where MG is the diagonal matrix having on its main diagonal the terms σn.
Thus, we have |MG(X − Y )| ≤ σn |X − Y |, i.e. KG = σn. Analogously, in

n

order to compute ¯KG it suﬃces to note that (cid:12)(cid:12)(X − Y )T (G(t, X) − G(t, Y ))(cid:12)(cid:12) =
(cid:12)(cid:12)(X − Y )T MG(X − Y )(cid:12)(cid:12) and therefore ¯KG = σn.

Now, following Theorem 2, the network synchronizes (i.e. a common decision
is achieved by the agents) if λ2 > r − σ2
2 . This condition has an interesting
interpretation. Speciﬁcally, it implies that a collective decision can be made
by network (10) if: (i) network nodes are well connected together (i.e. λ2 is
suﬃciently large); (ii) noise is suﬃciently strong (i.e. σn is suﬃciently large). In
order to provide a numerical demonstration for our synchronization condition,
consider a simple network of 5 nodes having a chain topology (i.e. λ2 = 0.38) and
where r = 5. Following our theoretical prediction, the network will synchronize
if σ2
n/2 > r − λ2, i.e. σn > 3. Such a prediction is conﬁrmed by Figure 2, where
the network behavior is shown for diﬀerent values of σn. The time behavior for
the terms σnxi’s is instead shown in Figure 3.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a new suﬃcient condition ensuring that a network
aﬀected by an exogenous white noise synchronizes or achieves consensus. Our
results are based on the use of stochastic Lyapunov functions and this allowed
us to consider networks modeled via Ito stochastic diﬀerential equations, with
nonlinear nodes and with the noise diﬀusion depending on the nodes’ state.
Our result oﬀers two interesting interpretations. First, as intuition might sug-
gest, in order for a network to achieve synchronization/consensus, its nodes
need to be suﬃciently well connected together, i.e. the network needs to have
a suﬃciently higher algebraic connectivity and coupling strength. A second im-
plication might seem, however, counter-intuitive. Speciﬁcally, our result implies
that, if noise diﬀusion is properly designed, then it can drive an unsynchronized
network towards synchronization/consensus. The idea of using noise to control
synchronization/consensus has been motivated by our research in smart cities
and IoT, where a network of smart objects typically needs to take decisions by
observing some local quantity and collecting evidences. In order to show the
eﬀectiveness of our approach, we apply our results to the study of collective de-
cision processes. Speciﬁcally, in accordance with our theoretical predictions, we
show that it is possible to force a collective decision for a network by properly

values of σn. Speciﬁcally, in top left panel, the behavior is shown for σn = 0.1
while in the top right panel the time evolution is for σn = 2. Such values do
not fulﬁll our condition for synchronization. In the bottom panels, instead, the
time behaviors are shown for σn = 4 (bottom left) and σn = 8 (bottom right).
Such values of σn fulﬁll our condition for synchronization and in fact a collective
decision is made by the network nodes. In the ﬁgure, the dashed black lines
(colors online) show the stable ﬁxed points for the nodes’ intrinsic dynamics
(rxi − x3
i ). The initial conditions for the network nodes have been taken from
the standard distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 5.

inducing noise. While this is particularly relevant for IoT applications, where
noise could be used to preserve privacy of a network node, this might also indi-
cate, at a more fundamental level, that the opinion formation of a population
can be driven towards a consensus by ﬂooding the network with a suﬃciently
large amount of noise.
