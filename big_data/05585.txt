We propose the concept of a quantized single-electron source based on the interplay between Coulomb block-
ade and magnetic ﬂux-controllable superconducting proximity effect. We show that ﬂux dependence of the in-
duced energy gap in the density of states of a nanosized metallic wire can be exploited as an efﬁcient tunable
energy barrier which enables charge pumping conﬁgurations with enhanced functionalities. This control pa-
rameter strongly affects the charging landscape of a normal metal island with non-negligible Coulombic energy.
Under a suitable evolution of a time-dependent magnetic ﬂux the structure behaves likewise a turnstile for single
electrons in a fully electrostatic regime.

Synchronized transport of charge quanta has been envis-
aged since the very beginning of single electronics [1], i.e.,
circuits where manipulation of single electrons can be per-
formed. So far a number of quantum effects have been ex-
ploited in solid-state devices to obtain a ﬁne control over elec-
tromagnetic quantities at the quantum information limit [2].
This technology has been exploited in a wide range of appli-
cations, covering on-chip cooling [3–5], single photons detec-
tion [6] and current sources [7]. Edge factors of nowadays
technology with respect to quantum metrology of electric cur-
rent stem from the trade-off between current amplitude and its
accuracy [7, 8], and from the high sensitivity of these struc-
tures to both background charge ﬂuctuations [9] and resid-
ual microwave radiation in the cryogenic setup [10]. Yet,
different approaches have been conceived to overcome these
limitations. Most of them relies on the so-called Coulomb-
blockade effect which can be tuned by a locally-applied elec-
tric ﬁeld through capacitively-coupled gates [7, 8, 11–13],
whereas only few schemes are based on a hybrid electric- and
magnetic-driven clocking [14, 15]. In this latter context it is
also worth mentioning two fully magnetic-ﬁeld-driven con-
cepts, i.e., a ferromagnetic single-electron pump [16], and a
Josephson quantum electron pump [17].

One recent promising proposal is based on the interplay be-
tween the superconducting energy gap and the charging en-
ergy in hybrid single-electron transistors (HSETs) [7, 11].
The turnstile operation of such a device originates from a
time-periodic voltage applied to a gate electrode capacitively-
coupled to a small metallic island, the preferential tunneling
direction through the structure being guaranteed by a ﬁnite
source-drain bias voltage. A different approach has been ap-
plied to two-dimensional electron gas-based charge pumps.
In this context, gate electrodes create the junctions barriers
which are shaped in a time-dependent fashion, allowing trans-
port of a single electron per cycle by taking advantage of the
Coulombic energy of the island [8]. These charge pumps op-
erate in a zero-bias conﬁguration, the directionality of events
being controlled by properly shaping in time the barriers.

On the basis of the above described strategies, and exploit-
ing recent advances in magnetic ﬂux-tunable proximity ef-
fect as an effective building block to implement phase coher-
ent superconductor-normal metal (SN) structures [18–21], we

conducting leads act as source and drain, respectively, whereas the
central gate electrode is capacitively-coupled to the N metal island.
The latter is connected to the lateral proximity N regions via tunnel
junctions. The loops are threaded by Φi (i = 1,2) magnetic ﬂuxes.

SQUISET biased at eV = ∆0 under a sweep of magnetic ﬂux with
Φ1 − Φ2 = Φ0/2. ∆0 is the zero-temperature superconducting en-
ergy gap, and Φ0 is the ﬂux quantum. Φ1 was set to 0.15Φ0 (b),
0.25Φ0(c) and 0.35Φ0(d). The island charging energy (Ec) leads to
a discrete level spacing vertically shifted by the gate electrode (ng =
0.5). For the above schemes we set Ec = ∆0.

put forward the concept of a quantized single-electron turn-
stile where the ﬂux-dependent proximity gap created in a N
nanowire acts as a tunable barrier coupled to a Coulomb-
blockaded island. In such a structure the magnetic ﬂux can
drive an opaque NIS junction to an NIN one, where I denotes

will be referred to as superconducting quantum interference
single-electron transistor (SQUISET).

We investigate a simple design for the SQUISET imple-
mentation by following Fig. 1(a). In particular, we assume
the structure to be symmetrical and composed by two iden-
tical superconduting quantum interference proximity transis-
tors (SQUIPTs) [18, 19] pierced by different magnetic ﬂuxes
Φ1 and Φ2, which play the role of source (1) and drain (2)
electrodes. Furthermore, the SQUIPTs are connected by a
normal metal (N) island through two identical tunnel junctions
of capacitance C and resistance RT. The island is capacitively-
coupled to a gate electrode at voltage Vg via the capacitance
Cg which induces ng = CgVg/e elementary charges on it. The
structure is symmetrically biased with a voltage V , and we
suppose the charging energy (Ec) of the island to be domi-
nated by the capacitance of the junctions, Ec = e2/2CΣ where
CΣ = 2C +Cg ≈ 2C. Each SQUIPT is composed by a super-
conducting loop interrupted by a diffusive N wire of length
L, and negligible transverse dimensions [22]. In the following
we assume the wire as quasi-one-dimensional, and its contacts
with the S ring as perfectly-transmitting interfaces. Moreover,
we consider the case of a short N bridge satisfying the condi-
tion Eth (cid:29) ∆0, where Eth = ¯hD/L2 is the Thouless energy, D
is the wire diffusion constant, and ∆0 is the zero-temperature
order parameter of the S loops. In such a regime an analytic
expression for the wire density of states (DoS) can be derived
therefore simplifying the transistor analysis. In addition, the
SQUISET performance is optimized in this limit since prox-
imity effect in the N wires is maximized. In this case the DoS
νi (i = 1,2) in each N proximized region is given by [23]

νi(E,Φi) =

(E + iΓi)2 − ∆2

E + iΓi
i (T )cos2(πΦi/Φ0)

(1)

where Γi (set to 10−5∆0 in all the calculations) models the in-
elastic scattering rate under the relaxation time approximation
[24], and Φ0 is the ﬂux quantum. From Eq. 1 it follows that
the DoS in the N wires shows a BCS-like shape with a ﬂux-
dependent induced gap, ∆i,g(T,Φi) = ∆i(T )|cos (πΦi/Φ0)|.
In particular, for Φi = Φ0/2 the gap is fully closed.

Insight into the operation principle of the SQUISET can
be gained by looking at Fig. 1(b-d) which shows a sketch
of the device clocking cycle via three energy diagrams corre-
sponding to different magnetic ﬂux values. The discrete en-
ergy levels generated by Ec are depicted in the island whereas
ﬂux-controllable energy gaps ∆i(Φi) are represented in both
source and drain electrodes. By changing the energy distribu-
tion of free and occupied states, the magnetic ﬂux can open
or close independently tunneling channels in the left and right
junction, the bias voltage imposing directionality to single-
electron current.

The ﬂux-dependent tunneling rates between the leads and
the island can be evaluated within the “orthodox theory” of

Equations

(5) are usually represented in a three-
dimensional stability diagram showing the electric current vs
V and ng. Although for the SQUISET the control parame-
ter (Φ1) would require a further dimension for the stability
diagram to be fully illustrated, one can easily follow this ad-
ditional dependence in Fig. 3 where we have selected three
representative conditions. Here the current surfaces have been
colored imposing the red, blue and green color channels pro-
portional to p−1, p0 and p1, respectively. It clearly appears
how not just the boundaries are tuned by the ﬂux but also
the blockade “diamonds” are deformed, and in some way “ro-
tated”, in the V -ng space. The three diagrams are essentially
showing the SQUISET conﬁguration that starts from NINIS-
like state (with Φ1 = 0), passes through a SINIS-like (at
Φ1/Φ0 = 0.25), eventually reaching a SININ-like behavior
(Φ1/Φ0 = 0.5). While in the regions of current interdiction
the island charging conﬁguration (n) is by deﬁnition ﬁxed to
almost unitary values (colored then by a single RGB channel
color), as soon as a ﬁnite current starts to ﬂow the island ex-
periences a time sequence of different n-states resulting in a
intermediate color.

As mentioned before, under particular circumstances

(ng =0.5), the ﬂux parameter can drive the SQUISET into
a charging state [Fig. 1(b)] or into a discharging state [Fig.
1(d)] passing through a blocked state [Fig. 1(c)]. In this situa-
tion the control parameters are then reduced to Φ1 and V only,
and a new kind of stability diagram can be introduced [see
Fig. 4(a)]. Here, the green channel is proportional to p0 and
the blue one to p1 so that it is clear how the device can settle
to different stable regions having the bias threshold |eV| <
2Max [∆1,g(0)|cos (πΦ1/Φ0)| ,∆2,g(0)|sin (πΦ1/Φ0)|] intro-
duced before with a ﬂux periodicity of 1/2Φ0. Figure 4(a)
shows how a closed trajectory in the Φ1−V space, and result-
ing in a single-electron net current per cycle, can be found.

Apart the above stationary approximation, Eq. (4) allows
to calculate [see Fig. 4(b)] the time evolution of the rates af-
fecting the state of the island during a particular magnetic ﬂux
cycle deﬁned, for instance, as

where tri(x) is the triangular waveform function. NΦ denotes
the peak-to-peak amplitude of the time-dependent modulation
in units of Φ0/2 [see the red arrow in Fig. 4(a)]. Equation
(6) is only one of the possible clocking cycles, and it has been
chosen here for the sake of clarity. It drives the induced gaps
in source and drain electrodes from a complete closing to the
situation where the N wires fully inherit a superconducting
behaviour from the S loops. Several ﬂux sequences transfer-
ring one charge per period can be easily found. We note that
even time-dependent cycles yielding an uncomplete closing of
the induced gaps can drive efﬁciently the single-charge clock-
ing mechanism under suitable biasing conditions. From Eq.
(6) the rates are then essentially alternating for the two NIS
junctions [see Fig. 4(b)]; moreover, they are almost constant
in “closed” states and dominated by the intra-gap leakage of
the induced gaps, while in the “open” state they reach a nearly
unitary value in unit of Γ0 ≡ ∆0/e2RT. The origin the leak-
age stems from the smeared DoS [see Eq. (1)] modeling the
environmental-assisted tunneling.

Following the system evolution by solving Eq. (3) we have
calculated the probabilities pn(t) during this particular con-
trol parameter cycle as a function of frequency for eV = ∆0
and ng = 0.5, and starting from a reasonable initial condi-
tion pn(0) = δn,0. After few cycles the system reaches a peri-
odic quasi-equilibrium in which the occupation probabilities
clearly oscillate from p1 to p0 state. In full analogy with the
turnstile behavior of an HSET driven by a radio-frequency
gate voltage, the SQUISET oscillates between p1 ∼ 1state
to p0 ∼ 1state, leaving spurious clocking proportional only
to exponentially-suppressed tunneling events. This particular
cycle is depicted in Fig. 1(b-d) where in Fig. 1(b) the full
branch of the drain DoS reaches the n = 1energy level lead-
ing to a “charging state” where a single quasiparticle can tun-
nel into the island. In the intermediate period, shown in Fig.
1(c), both junctions are in a blockaded state due to the inter-
play between the charing energy and the energy gaps. In Fig.
1(d) the upper, empty branch of the source’s DoS aligns to the

driving it to the initial n = 0state. In this way one electron per
cycle is moved from drain to source generating a net current
equal to (cid:104)I(cid:105) = e f .

Considering an arbitrary ﬂux modulation amplitude NΦ, the
average source-drain current can be obtained by integrating

SQUISET acts thereby in a single-electron turnstile fashion
moving [NΦ ] charges each cycle, being [NΦ ] the NΦ nearest
integer. The maximum generated current is limited by the RTC
time constant associated to a single electron tunneling event
essentially responsible for the missed tunneling errors. This
proportionality holds for the triangular waveform suggested
in Eq. (6) which maximizes the cutoff frequency, superim-
posing an instantaneous current across each junction with a
−1 periodicity in the time domain. In this view, un-
( f · [NΦ ])
der the driving expressed by Eq. (6) the SQUISET realizes
the relation (cid:104)I(cid:105) = [NΦ ]· e f .

For the SQUISET implementation we exploited the pecu-
liar behavior of Eq. (1) making the NIS junctions in a HSET-
like structure tunable by introducing an additional control pa-
rameter, the magnetic ﬂux. The pure quantum nature of ﬂux-
tunable phase interference in a proximized nanowire guides
the single-electron tunneling in the semiclassical regime. In
this view our SQUISET adds new perspectives to metallic sin-
gle electronics introducing different clocking conﬁgurations
which can be of interest as building blocks in ﬁelds other
than quantized current generation, like coherent caloritron-
ics [26–31] or quantum information technology [32]. Fur-
ther investigation on pumping accuracy is crucial including
higher order tunneling processes for which the static condi-
tion ng = 0.5could potentially limit unwanted events to two
orders of magnitude lower than in the SINIS turnstile [33].
Eventually, the coupling with the environmental residual ra-
diation as a source of intra-gap leakage [10] and the back-
ground charge ﬂuctuation sensitivity of the SQUISET as a
fully electro-statical single-electron clocking device [34] are
still unexplored phenomena in the ﬁeld of phase-coherent sin-
gle electronics.
