Geometrical Aspects of non-gravitational interactions

Abstract

In this work we look for a geometric description of non-gravitational forces. The basic
ideas are proposed studying the interaction between a punctual particle and an electromag-
netic external ﬁeld. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of proper space-time, that
allow us to describe this interaction in a way analogous to the one that the general relativity
theory does for gravitation. The ﬁeld equations that deﬁne this geometry are similar to the
Einstein’s equations, where in general, the energy-momentum tensor have information of
both, the particle and the external ﬁeld. In this formalism we consider the particle path as
being a geodesic in a curved space-time, and so, the electromagnetic force is understood in
a purely geometric way.

Introduction

As our knowledge of Physics improves, more and more the general theory of relativity is showing
to be a fundamental theory. Among many important results that could be listed, the recent
detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO experiment [1] is just one example.

Although, when considering non-gravitational interactions there are still some questions to
be answered. An interesting aspect to be observed is the preferential role of the gravitational
interactions in this theory, as all interactions are coupled to the gravity by the gravitational
constant G in the right-hand side of the Einstein equations. A fundamental question is if the
gravitational interaction really is a preferential kind of interaction or if all interactions may be
considered in an equivalent way. Another question that may be posed is how a system where
the gravity is negligible if compared with the other kinds of interactions may be considered in
a geometrical approach. Some interesting results of these ideas at the quantum level have been
shown in [2] and [3]. In this work, this possibility will be studied and the formulation of the
basic ideas will be made in terms of the interaction of a point-like particle with an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

The theory of General Relativity (GR) describes the gravitation as a geometrical eﬀect. In
this way, in absence of non-gravitational forces1, any particle will follow a geodesic path on a
given curved space-time (hereafter s-t) as described by the geodesic equation

Being a geometrical eﬀect, it implies that the evolution of each particle in a gravitational

ﬁeld is independent on their characteristics such as charge, mass or spin.

1In this work, our main interest is in studying interactions other than gravitation.

A diﬀerent situation is the case of a charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic ﬁeld

(hereafter EM ﬁeld), in which the trajectory is determined by

(2)

where m is the mass of the particle and f µ is the Lorentz force which depends on the particle’s
charge. Then, when introducing interactions other than gravitation in the usual formulation of
GR, the dynamics of particles is not (completely) described in geometrical terms.

In this work, we want to eﬀectively describe the electromagnetic interaction as a geometrical
phenomena. That is, we begin with the assumption that the path followed by a charged particle
in presence of an EM ﬁeld, correspond to a geodesic in a certain curved s-t, which we will call
the particle’s proper space-time (proper s-t). Thinking in this way, each particle is in free fall
in its own s-t, which must necessarily depend on the interaction between the particle and its
environment (the external ﬁelds).

Then, we must carefully distinguish between this abstract s-t (the proper s-t) and the s-t
which is perceived by the observer in the laboratory (our s-t). We will call this last one the
background space-time (background s-t).

To our knowledge, there is no theory at present which totally describes the electromagnetic
interaction in a geometric way. Many people have care about this issue, moved for example by
Einstein’s spirit which in its own words is: “The idea that there are two structures of space
independent of each other, the metric-gravitational and the electromagnetic, is intolerable to the
theoretical spirit” (Aspden [4], and Barnett [5]).

Hermann Weyl (Pauli [6], see also [7]), developed a generalized version of Riemann geometry
to describe the electromagnetism in a geometrical way. Even though it was a very deep theory
in which he has able to obtain the Maxwell equations by just using geometry, this formalism
was practically abandoned, as it predicts some eﬀects which are not consistent with observations
(Pauli [6])

It’s not the purpose of this work to give a geometric description of electromagnetism, but
just to gain some insights on how to proceed in order to eﬀectively describe the interaction of a
charged particle and an EM ﬁeld. Some useful results can be obtained with this approach as it
was done for example, in the work of Barros [2, 3, 8], in which by using the spherical symmetry
in the interaction of electron with a proton in the Hydrogen atom, he managed to obtain a
Minkowski-like metric and it allows him to obtain the spectrum of the system which is very close
to the observed one.

This work is organized in four sections. In section 1. we make the weak ﬁeld approximation
and the limit of small velocity to get a ﬁrst relationship between the metric of the proper s-t, the
external EM ﬁeld and the particle mass and charge. Section 2. sets the main ideas on how to
obtain the metric for the proper s-t in more general cases. Section 3 and 4. give the applications
of the present formalism and its comparison with the results of the Special Relativity (SR). In
the last section the conclusions will be drawn.

1 Weak ﬁeld and small velocity limit

1.1 Geodesic equation and Lorentz force

The ﬁrst step in order to construct the proper s-t is to determine it in the weak ﬁeld limit and
its relation with a ﬂat s-t, in a way similar to the one that is done in the General Relativity Theory.

2

In the weak ﬁeld approximation we can think of the proper s-t as described by a metric gµν
which is a small perturbation of the background s-t. For simplicity we shall take this background
s-t to be ﬂat and so described by the Minkowski metric2 ηµν

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

|hµν| (cid:28) 1.

(3)

Here hµν is understood as a two-tensor in the background s-t, and is responsible for the force
on the charged particle (as perceived by the observer). The inverse metric at linear order in h is

gµν = ηµν − hµν,

hµλ = ηµνηλσhνσ,

that is, we rise and lower indices with the background metric.

The Christoﬀel symbols Γµ

ρσ for the metric g are expressed into the usual form

Γµ

ρσ =

gµλ(−gρσ,λ + gλρ,σ + gσλ,ρ),

which can be related to the Christoﬀel symbols ˜Γµ

Unlike ˜Γµ
instead of Aµ

ρσ is a tensor, as we now see. To prove this, it is easier to consider Aµρσ

Aµρσ = − 1

where ∇ means the covariant derivative with respect to the background s-t, that is

∇µhρσ = ∂µhρσ − ˜Γλ

µρhλσ − ˜Γλ

µσhρλ ,

(8)

(9)

and the statement about Aµρσ is veriﬁed. Now the main idea of the proper s-t concept, is that
the particle will follow a geodesic in this curved s-t, so the particle’s path should obey

2This approach is common in perturbation theory for the study of gravitational waves, see: [9, 10, 11, 12].
3In Cartesian coordinates ˜Γµ

ρσ vanishes, but this is not the case in spherical coordinates for example. Using

˜Γµ

ρσ explicitly allows us to easily generalize our present treatment to a curved background s-t.

If we take the limit of small velocities the proper time τ in the background s-t and in the
proper s-t are the same, and we can set τ = t, where t is the time as measured by the observer.
In addition4, dxi/dτ (cid:28) dx0/dτ ≈ c, then by comparing Eq. (11) with Eq. (2) we can say that
the observer in the laboratory will measure a force f µ given by 5

where we used the fact that Aµ

ρσ is symmetric in ρσ.

To continue, let’s stress that we are considering an inertial observer in a ﬂat background s-t,

whose metric in Cartesian coordinates is

ηµν = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).

(13)

Now, if this observer choose any other coordinate system to describe the spatial part, say,

spherical coordinates, but without changing the temporal part, then

where in general ηij = ηij((cid:126)x) (cid:54)= 0 for i (cid:54)= j. Note that if we make a boost this will aﬀect the
time component, but as far as we take the limit of small velocities, we are somehow performing a
Galilean transformation of coordinates, which does not aﬀect the time component of the metric.

Considering this convention we have that in general ˜Γµ

ρσ (cid:54)= 0, but

˜Γ0
µσ = ˜Γλ

µ0 = ˜Γλ

0σ = 0.

Using this fact we can easily compute

∇0hρσ = ∂0hρσ, ∇ih00 = ∂ih00,

situation will be addressed in a future paper.

We want to stress that the EM potential Aµ is a vector in the background s-t, and by
construction hµν is a tensor. Then, it seems that the quantity (h00/2, h0i) cannot be identiﬁed
with a vector as we suggested in Eq. (18). However, as it was said, in this paper we only allow
spatial coordinates transformations (or Galilean transformations)6

and so, Aµ transform as

The transformation for h0µ is given by

(23)

that is, h0µ has the same behavior as Aµ under this restricted group of transformations7. We
leave the discussion about a possible generalization to any group of transformations for a future
paper.

6E.g., we can go from Cartesian (t, x, y, z) to spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ).
7We can also note that this property applies to the covariant derivative. That is, from Eq. (16) we see that

h00 behaves like a scalar while h0i transform like a vector.

5

From Eq. (11) we see that the quantity we can directly measure is Aµ

ρσ, once this is directly
related to the force f µ or to the particle’s path. Then, in accordance with Eq. (8) we can think
of hµσ as an interacting potential. This leads necessarily to a gauge freedom for the tensor hµσ
and so for the metric gµσ.

We can then ask, which is the more general “group” of transformations on hµν that leaves
the dynamics of the particle invariant as perceived by the observer. To start with, we can seek
for which transformations leave the Riemann tensor invariant. This was already solved (see e.g.,
Carroll [9])

hµν → hµν + ∇µξν + ∇νξµ,

ρσ is not invariant under this

(27)

where ξµ is an arbitrary vector8in the background s-t. However, Aµ
general transformation as we will see now. From Eq. (8) we have

(cid:40)

(cid:41)

,

Aµρσ → 1

− ∇µ (hρσ + ∇ρξσ + ∇σξρ)

+ ∇σ (hµρ + ∇µξρ + ∇ρξµ) + ∇ρ (hσµ + ∇σξµ + ∇µξσ)

which leads to

Aµρσ → Aµρσ − ∇ρ∇σξµ,

(28)
and we have used ∇ρ∇σ = ∇σ∇ρ which is valid for a ﬂat s-t, as we assumed to be the case for
the background s-t.

Using this transformation we can easily see that the Riemann tensor is invariant. Substituting

into Eq. (26) we get

Rµνρσ → ∇σ (Aµνρ − ∇ν∇ρξµ) − ∇ρ (Aµσν − ∇σ∇νξµ)

= Rµνρσ.

(29)

Though Aµρσ is not invariant under the full group of transformations (Eq. (27)), if we ﬁx the
three spatial components ξi, then the gauge freedom is due only to ξ0 and we get the restricted
transformation

h0i → h0i + ∇iξ0,
Deﬁning ξ0 = (q/mc) φ, we have the gauge transformation

h00 → h00 + 2∇0ξ0,

(cid:19)

(30)

(31)

which is perfectly consistent with the gauge transformation Aµ → Aµ + ∇µφ, see Eq. (18).

Under this restricted group of transformations the tensor A transform according to (see

Eq. (28))

A0ρσ → A0ρσ − ∇ρ∇σξ0, Aiρσ → Aiρσ ,

and since Aiρσ is invariant, then the force fi (see Eq. (12))

will also be invariant. However the temporal component

which represents the energy transfer is not invariant. We leave the solution of this problem for
a future paper.

In section 1, we used the limit of weak ﬁeld and small velocities to obtain a relationship
between the proper s-t metric and the external EM ﬁeld.
In the next section we go an step
further and to try to tackle the more general case in which the ﬁelds and velocities do not need
be small.

2 Electromagnetic ﬁeld in the proper s-t

In Special Relativity and in Cartesian coordinates, the electromagnetic tensor F µν is totally
deﬁned by the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (cid:126)E, (cid:126)B (See [9, 13, 14, 15])

F 0i ≡ Ei/c, Fij ≡ ˜ijkBk,

(35)

where ˜ijk is the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol, with ˜123 = 1. However, in the
general case, the tensor F µν is not completely deﬁned by (cid:126)E and (cid:126)B, since we need to know the
metric (in this case, ηµν) in order to know F0i and F ij. Let’s study this in more detail.

In a curved s-t we need to use the Levi-Civita tensor, which in four dimensions is given by

(see e.g Carroll [9])

µνρσ ≡ √−g˜µνρσ,

g = det(gµν),

(36)

and once more ˜µνρσ is totally antisymmetric with ˜0123 = 1. The Levi-Civita tensor with upper
indexes is

(37)

(38)

µνρσ ≡ ˜µνρσ√−g

˜0123 = −1.
√−g) the other components Fij. So, in general
F 0i ≡ Ei/c, Fij ≡ 0ijkBk.

,

by the factor

Then, the electric ﬁeld determine the F 0i components, while magnetic ﬁeld determine (except

Nonetheless, a complete knowledge of the EM tensor is only possible with the help of the
metric, e.g., to know F0i = g0µgiνF µν we need not only the metric g as well as the components
F ij, which also depend on Fµν by F ij = giµgjνFµν.

Then, we see that in general the EM tensor Fµν will depend on the particle’s properties
(because of the dependence on gµν) but since the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (cid:126)E e (cid:126)B are external
ﬁelds

Ei = cF 0i,

and Bi ≡ 1
2

0ijkFjk,

(39)

they are independent on the particle’s charge and mass. (cid:126)E and (cid:126)B are not unknown quantities,
they are imposed as external conditions.

To proceed, we shall give three essential statements for a general proper s-t:

The ﬁrst one is that for vanishing external EM ﬁeld ( (cid:126)E = (cid:126)B = 0) the proper s-t must coincide

with the background s-t.

The second one is that, from the point of view of the proper s-t formalism, the charged particle
follows a geodesic in a curved s-t which is determined by the interaction with the external EM
ﬁelds (cid:126)E and (cid:126)B, so it is natural that the EM tensor built through Eq. (39) must satisfy the
Maxwell equations in the proper s-t. That is,

∇µF νµ = µ0J ν,

7

(40)

where hereafter ∇µ is the covariant derivative in the proper s-t, and J ν is the current density
which sources the EM ﬁeld. In addition, in the present work we are interested in the case in
which the charged particle is moving in the vacuum (not in a medium) so we can set J ν = 0.
Note that in the background s-t J ν need not be zero everywhere, but it is only non-zero in places
where our particle of interest in not moving on.

And as a third statement, we will consider that if we apply a force f i to this particle9 the

equation of motion should be

d2xi

3 Applications

(44)

(45)

(46)

In the previous section we have set the basis for obtaining the metric of the proper s-t. In the
remaining of this work we will apply such principles to obtain the proper s-t metric deﬁned in
two cases of interest: a spherically symmetric electric ﬁeld and a constant electric ﬁeld.

3.1 Spherically Symmetric proper s-t

As a ﬁrst application we will consider a particle of charge q in the presence of an external electric
ﬁeld with spherical symmetry. We assume that exist coordinates t, r, θ, φ such that the metric is
diagonal

ds2 = −ea(cid:0)c2dt2(cid:1) + ebdr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2,

(47)

with a and b functions of r alone.

Since we do not know which are the ﬁeld equations that would allow us to obtain the metric,

we can try to gain some information about gµν by trying to solve the Maxwell equations

∇µF νµ = µ0J ν = 0,

(48)

9Here, by force we mean any other interaction that is not explicitly include in the geometry of the proper s-t.

It can be or not of EM type.

whose only non-trivial solution is

∇µF 0µ = ∂rF 0r + Γµ

From the Christoﬀel symbols deﬁnition

Since, E = cF 0r is the electric ﬁeld which is independent on the proper s-t as discussed in

for some constant source charge Q. Using this into Eq. (52) we note that a = −b or

3.2 Field equations

Now that we do know which is the metric for the spherically symmetric case, we can try to ﬁnd
out a ﬁeld equation for the proper s-t which allows us to obtain the metric in any case. We
propose to search for an Einstein-like equation

Gµν = kTµν,

(59)

for some constant k, and for a given energy-momentum tensor Tµν which should depend on the
interaction of the particle with the EM ﬁeld.

By using the metric of the previous section, and ﬁxing the gauge, r0 = ∞, we arrive at

Gθ

θ = Gφ

0 = −Gr

r =

(60)

Note that, in this case the Einstein tensor is traceless, which is also the case for the EM

(61)

so, we can try to use this as the source for our ﬁeld equations. We need however to stress that
this is a gauge dependent statement, as Eq. (60) was obtained in a ﬁxed gauge, and it can be
shown that for a general r0, the metric in Eq. (57) leads to

(62)

that is, the trace of the Einstein tensor does not vanishes.

In addition, the EM tensor in Eq. (61) should be treated as the EM tensor in the proper s-t
not on the background s-t, then indexes should be raised and lowered with the metric gµν not
ηµν. Computing the Eq. (61) for our case, we have

This result was ﬁrst obtained by Barros [8]. Now that we are in possession of the ﬁeld

equations let’s obtain the metric for the case of a constant electric ﬁeld.

3.3 Uniform Electric Field

Let’s consider an electric ﬁeld in the z-axis, which is independent of t, x, y. If we assume that
the line element is diagonal in this coordinate system, then

ds2 = −ea(cid:0)c2dt2(cid:1) + eb(dx2 + dy2) + eddz2,

where a, b and c are functions of z only. By symmetry reasons we choose gxx = gyy.

The Maxwell equations leads to

∇µF 0µ = ∂zF 0z + Γµ

µzF 0z = 0,

10

(65)

(66)

or

ln(eae2bedE2) = constant.

(67)

If now we set E = E0 = constant, then, a + 2b + d = constant, and using the fact that

a = b = d = 0 for E0 = 0, then10

d = −a − 2b.

(68)

With this result, we may compute the Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum tensor,

whose non-vanishing components are

4 Analyzing the equations of motions

In this section we examine the equations of motion in the proper s-t and their consequences on
the dynamics of the particle. The treatment for the spherical case is very similar to the usual
one of the Schwarzschild metric, so we do not detail on this here. The case of proper s-t of a
particle inside a constant electric ﬁeld deserves more attention. From the previous section we
have for (cid:126)E = E0 ˆz (we take without loosing generality E0 > 0)

ds2 = ξ(cid:0)−c2dt2 + dz2(cid:1) + ξ−1(cid:0)dx2 + dy2(cid:1) ,

ξ = [1 + 3λ (z − z∗)]

−2/3 ,

qE0
m0c2 .

(77)
We see that the metric has a singularity at 3λ(z − z∗) = −1. This appears to be totally
opposite to what we expect from translational invariance. However, we will now see that initial
conditions do not allow the particle to reach such singular point.

λ =

As we will show later (see Eq. (82)), setting vz = 0 leads us to a quadratic equation in ξ
which gives two solutions, one with ξ > 0 and other with ξ < 0. The physical solution is that of
positive ξ, then necessarily we have

λ (z0 − z∗) > −1 ,

(78)

where z0 is the coordinate such that vz = 0.

As we can see intuitively and is shown in Figure 1, a positive charge (λ > 0) will move to
the right of z0 due to the action of the electric ﬁeld E0 > 0, and a negative charge will move to
the left. So, for λ > 0 we have z ≥ z0, while for λ < 0 we have z ≤ z0 for all z in the particle’s
trajectory, then we always have λ (z − z0) ≥ 0. As a consequence

λ (z − z∗) = λ (z − z0) + λ (z0 − z∗) ≥ λ (z0 − z∗) > −1 ,

(79)

and therefore the particle never reaches the singularity and in this way it respect the translational
In fact, if we redeﬁne z → ¯z = z − w, then necessarily z0 → ¯z0 = z0 − w and
invariance.
z∗ → ¯z∗ = z∗ − w; consequently ¯z − ¯z∗ = z − z∗.

Figure 1: Direction of motion from the return position z0.

If for example the particle starts at position z1 and goes in direction of z0, then when arriving
at z0 their velocity will change sign, forcing the particle to go back. We will then call z0 the
return position.

We know (see Carroll [9]) that if the metric does not depend on a given coordinate xµ, then

the corresponding momentum

E = −p0 c/m, P = px/m and py.

To have an idea of which order of magnitude in usual units we are talking about, consider the
example given in Bouda and Belabbas [16]. For a dust particle of mass m ≈ 10−14kg, saturation
charge11 q ≈ 10−18C, and c2 = 9 × 1016m2/s2, we have
λ ≈ 10−21E0/V ,

(92)
where V means volts. An electric ﬁeld as intense as E0 ≈ 108V /m is rare in practice (Bouda and
Belabbas [16], see also [17]), for such an intense ﬁeld we have λ ≈ 10−13/m (here m stands for
meter). Then for such a particle moving in a region |∆z| as big as a billion meter size the linear
approximation works quite well and so Eq. (90) coincides with Eq. (91).

Figure 2 compares the two approaches, continuous lines are the SR solutions while dashed
lines are the solutions for the proper s-t. For small values of λz, say λz < 0.1 the two cases agree
very well. We also see that in the proper s-t formalism, the particle approach the limit velocity
v = c, slower than in the SR case.

Figure 2: Velocity vs position. Dotted lines are the prediction of Eq. (90) while continuous lines
are predicted by SR Eq. (91).

4.2 Solution to the equation of motion

In this section, in order to complete our analysis, we obtain the time dependence of the particle’s
path. For simplicity we restrict our calculations to the one dimensional case P = 0, and again
we take z∗ = z0 = 0 (or v∗ = 0).

In this case we have (Eq. (90))

u−2/3 = 1 − v2/c2, → cdt = ±

with u = 1 + 3λz. Then, in terms of u, Eq. (93) yields

Figure 3 shows a set of geodesics for diﬀerent initial conditions: 3λz = 0, 1.5, 3. The cases
3λz = 1.5 and 3λz = 3, start with negative velocity and approach to the return point (in this
case, the origin), then go back to the z > 0 region. The other case is for initial conditions 3λz = 0
and v = 0, so they are always moving away from the origin.

The initial velocities for each case, can be obtained from Eq. (90)

In this plot we explicitly see that due to the initial conditions and the return position, the
particle never approach the region λz < 0 (here z∗ = 0), this makes the proper s-t described by
Eq. (77) free of singularities. We see also that basically each curve is equal to the other up to a
displacement, this agrees with translational invariance as we would expect.

In this work we have introduced the concept of proper s-t as a geometric tool to describe the
interaction between a punctual particle and an electromagnetic external ﬁeld. In this formalism
we have considered the particle path as being a geodesic in a curved space-time, and so, the
electromagnetic force could be understood in a purely geometric way.

With those considerations we have seen in section 1.1 that the geodesic equation in the
proper s-t leads to the Lorentz force in the limit of weak ﬁeld and small velocities. This allowed
us to relate the metric in the proper s-t with the EM potential. In section 2 we have proposed
general statements about the characteristics a the proper s-t beyond the weak ﬁeld approximation
which allowed us to make some applications in section 3. In particular, we have obtained the
ﬁeld equations that deﬁne this geometry which are similar to the Einstein’s equations, where in
general, the energy-momentum tensor have information of both, the particle and the external
ﬁeld. We have seen however, that those ﬁeld equations violate gauge invariance, as they are
only valid in a speciﬁc gauge. This is a question that must be studied more carefully and will
be left for future works. We have also conﬁrmed that the present treatment is compatible with
SR in the limit of small velocities and weak ﬁelds (see section 4.1), that means that the general
behavior of the particle has been obtained. An interesting result is that it is possible to ﬁnd
connexions to the usual formulation, and the conditions in order to observe these connections
are determined. Thinking in these terms, the proposed theory may be seen as a generalization
of the usual theory.
