A BosonSampling device is a quantum machine expected to perform tasks intractable for a
classical computer, yet requiring minimal non-classical resources as compared to full-scale quan-
tum computers. Photonic implementations to date employed sources based on ineﬃcient processes
that only simulate heralded single-photon statistics when strongly reducing emission probabilities.
BosonSampling with only single-photon input has thus never been realised. Here, we report on a
BosonSampling device operated with a bright solid-state source of highly-pure single-photon Fock
states: the emission from an eﬃcient and deterministic quantum dot-micropillar system is demulti-
plexed into three partially-indistinguishable single-photons, with purity 1−g(2)(0) of 0.990 ± 0.001,
interfering in a 6×6 linear optics network. Our demultiplexed source is orders-of-magnitude brighter
than current heralded multi-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion, al-
lowing us to complete the BosonSampling experiment 100 times faster than previous equivalent
implementations. This intrinsic source superiority places BosonSampling with larger photon num-
bers within near reach.

A core tenet of computer science is the Extended
Church-Turing thesis, which states that all computa-
tional problems that are eﬃciently solvable by physi-
cally realistic machines are eﬃciently simulatable with
classical resources. In 2011 Aaronson and Arkhipov in-
troduced BosonSampling, a quantum protocol for ef-
ﬁciently sampling the output of a multimode bosonic
interferometer [1–5]: a problem apparently intractable
with classical computation. When scaled to many bosons
this model of intermediate—i.e. non-universal—quantum
computation will provide the strongest evidence against
the Extended Church-Turing thesis.

The most experimentally accessible boson is the pho-
ton: to date full BosonSampling protocols have been
performed using up to 4 photons [6–10]. These ini-
tial assays are well short of the numbers of single pho-
tons required to probe the Extended Church-Turing the-
sis: scalable photonic technology is required. The three
core technologies needed for scalable quantum photon-
ics are: single-photon sources [11–15]; large interferomet-
ric networks, with current integrated and programmable
technology [16–19]; and eﬃcient photon detection, with
demonstrated number resolution [20, 21], and eﬃciencies
of up to 95% [22].

Scaling of BosonSampling is primarily limited by
photon sources. All
implementations to date used
photons obtained from spontaneous parametric down-
conversion (SPDC), which is far from the ideal source
of single-photon Fock states, |ψ(cid:105)=|1(cid:105), instead produc-

non-heralded 2n-photon source can be built by using n
down-converters, but it can only be used in speciﬁc proto-
cols where the impact of higher photon-numbers is min-
imised [23]; conversely, it can be operated as a heralded
n-photon source by detecting n photons—one from each
down-converter—to herald the presence of their n single-
photon partners. Multi-photon rates for state-of-the-art
pulsed down-conversion sources [24–27], pumped at a
standard 80 MHz repetition rate, range from ∼300 kHz
for 2 photons—yielding heralded single-photons at that
rate—down to ∼3 mHz for 8 photons—yielding 4 her-
alded single-photons at that rate. For as little as 6 her-
alded single-photons, the rate (∼1 per year) becomes less
than the detection rate of gravitational waves [28]. Us-
ing down-conversion to scale BosonSampling to many
single-photons is clearly infeasible.

Quantum-dots in photonic structures [29–33] have
been recently shown to produce long streams of indistin-
guishable single-photons with large emission yields [34,
35]. Eﬃcient temporal-to-spatial demultiplexing of these
sources will enable multi-photon experiments at scales
heretofore impossible. Here we implement a Boson-
Sampling device operated with a bright demultiplexed
source of three highly-pure single-photon Fock states
from the emission of a deterministic quantum dot-
micropillar system [30]. The high source brightness al-
lows us to complete the BosonSampling experiment

FIG. 1. A BosonSampling device with pure single-photons. (a) Second-order autocorrelation function g(2)(∆t) (log
scale). A Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment results in coincidences every 1/RL=12.5 ns: decreased detected events—
antibunching—at ∆t=0 indicates non-classical states of light. An ideal single-photon Fock state has g(2)(0)=0; we measure
g(2)(0)=0.010±0.001, resulting in a single-photon purity 1−g(2)(0) of 0.990±0.001. (b) Experimental setup of BosonSampling
with a solid-state single photon source. Laser pulses centred at 905 nm excite a quantum-dot embedded in a micropillar cavity,
which itself is housed in an optically accessable cryostat (Cryo) system at 13 K. A dichroic mirror (DM), and band-pass ﬁlter
(BP) with 0.85 nm FWHM are used to isolate the emitted single-photons at 932 nm collected in a single-mode ﬁbre (SMF).
A passive demultiplexer composed of beam-splitters with tunable transmittances—half-wave plates (HWP), and polarising
beam-splitters (PBS)—and compensating delay lines of 12.5 ns probabilistically converts three consecutive single photons into
separate spatial modes, where they are directed into the BosonSampling circuit. The scattering linear network is composed of
polarisers (Pol), half-wave plates, a 3×3 non-polarising ﬁbre beam-splitter (FBS), and polarising ﬁbre beam-splitters (PFBS),
which in combination form a 6×6 mode network [6]. Six avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) are used at the output to detect up
to 3-fold coincidence events.

two orders-of-magnitude faster than in previous imple-
mentations. Our results prove solid-state sources an ap-
pealing candidate to constitute the basis for future quan-
tum photonics, in particular for the implementation of
BosonSampling with larger photon numbers.

Source of multiple single-photon Fock states.
Laser pulses with a repetition rate of RL=80 MHz and
wavelength centred at 905 nm provide quasi-resonant
excitation of an InGaAs quantum-dot deterministically
coupled to a micropillar cavity, see refs. [30, 34] for a
detailed description of this quantum dot-micropillar sys-
tem. An optimised collection eﬃciency results in a record
probability per pump-pulse of ﬁnding an spectrally-
isolated single-photon at the output of a single-mode
ﬁber—an absolute brightness—of up to η0=0.14. As
a result, our core source generates up to ∼11 MHz of
single-photons, modulo detector eﬃciencies, from which
3.6 MHz are detected with an avalanche photodiode
(APD) of 32% quantum eﬃciency [34]. The absolute
brightness depends on the laser pump power P accord-
ing to η=η0
ration power. Under quasi-resonant excitation, single-
photon sources based on non-gated quantum dots are
subject to small and random frequency jitter—known
as spectral diﬀusion—due to charges near the solid-state
emitter [36, 37]. This results in the emission of pho-
tons with partial indistinguishability, which in our case
is around 50–70% depending on the exact pump condi-
tions [34]. These values are comparable to that in for-
mer BosonSampling experiments for photons from in-
dependent down-conversion events [6–10]. Our source

(cid:0)1−e−P/P0(cid:1), with P0=150 µW the satu-

sees a small reduction in purity and indistinguishability
with increasing pump power, we thus choose to operate
it at P =1.2P0. At this condition, it exhibits a single-
photon purity 1−g(2)(0) of 0.990 ± 0.001, see Fig. 1a,
where g(2)(∆t) is the second-order autocorrelation func-
tion, ∆t is a time-lapse between two events deﬁning a
coincidence detection, and g(2)(0)=0 holds for an ideal
|n(cid:105)=|1(cid:105) Fock state.
At this point, our source consists of sequentially emit-
ted single-photons in orthogonal temporal modes within
the same spatial mode. Our task now is to demultiplex it
from the temporal to spatial domain, resulting in multi-
ple orthogonal spatial modes containing a single-photon
each with the same temporal mode, thus yielding a mul-
tiple single-photon source. This could be achieved with
an active—temporally-varying—switcher, such that each
of n consecutive single-photons is routed into a diﬀerent
spatial channel. Together with appropriate compensat-
ing delays, this results in a scalable method to demul-
tiplex a photon source to multiple channels by optical
switching.

A simpler alternative is to implement a passive demul-
tiplexer, see Fig. 1b. Here, photon routing occurs by
using an array of n−1 chained beamsplitters with tuned
transmittances as to evenly distribute, with probability
1/n, each single-photon into one of n possible outputs.
The high absolute brightness in our core source allows
us to readily operate sources of 2 and 3 single-photons.
In Table I, we show the detected, and generated—
corrected for detector eﬃciencies—count-rates of our de-
multiplexed n-photon source: n single-photons in the
same temporal mode at the output of n single-mode ﬁ-

The probabilistic demultiplexer is non-scalable,

its
success probability, modulo optical
scales as
1/nn; and the APD’s quantum eﬃciency at these wave-
lengths is ∼30%. Remarkably, even when implemented
with this passive demultiplexer and low-eﬃciency de-
tectors, our count-rates meet those of high-purity non-
heralded SPDC multi-photon sources [24–27].
Since
our source intrinsically produces single—as opposed to
twin—photons, a more relevant comparison is that to
heralded SPDC single-photon rates. In this comparison,
our source’s detected and generated rates are respectively
one and two orders-of-magnitude brighter, for both n=2,
and n=3. (See ref. [38] for more details on our demulti-
plexed sources with both active and passive approaches).
Using this method, 2 and 3 partially-indistinguishable
single-photons are used as inputs into a 6 × 6 ﬁber-
based linear network L consisting of 3 spatial- and 2
polarisation-encoded modes, see Fig. 1b. The relative
temporal delay between photons is ﬁne-tuned as to
erase their temporal distinguishability, and the use of
polarising ﬁbre beam-splitters ensures that they are
indistinguishable in polarisation.

BosonSampling with solid-state photon sources.
We ﬁrst input N =2 single-photons, and characterise
the M =6-mode L network—in general a non-unitary
transfer matrix due to inevitable optical losses—using
the method described in ref. [39], see Supplementary
Material. Following the theoretical model developed in
ref. [40], 2 photons with a degree of indistinguishability
quantiﬁed by I, entering L in inputs {i, j} and exiting
from outputs {k1, k2} lead to a 2-fold coincidence
probability:

tons exit L in diﬀerent modes, so-called no-collision

at these outputs allow us to extract—in a single ex-
perimental run—both the sampling distribution result-
ing from the Boson Sampler—that is, with partially-
indistinguishable photons—and that of a (classical) dis-
tinguishable sampler arising from completely distinguish-
able particles. Given an output conﬁguration k, coin-
cidences detected under the area A0

∆t=0 are subject to two-photon interference: they de-
termine the Boson Sampler distribution by measuring

k. Conversely, photons leading to coincidences
around ∆t= ± l×(12.5 ns), for l integer, do not inter-
fere, and one would expect that these distributions con-
tain information of a classical sampler. Indeed, following
ref. [34], one can deduce that the distinguishable sam-
pler distribution is measured via p(2)

and Ap

events, however, does not provide access to the entire
output distribution, thus to obtain probabilities we nor-
malise the measured distributions to the corresponding
theoretical prediction according to Eq. (1)—that is, the
sum of experimentally obtained probabilities within the
no-collision subspace is matched to that as in theory; and,
given a 2-photon input {i, j}, Ii,j is extracted from the
measured output distribution, see Supplementary Mate-
rial.

Figure 2b shows our 2-photon BosonSampling re-
sults. Experimental distributions for the Boson Sampler
(blue bars) are shown for 3 diﬀerent 2-photon inputs,
and their theoretical distributions (empty bars) are ob-
tained with pair-wise indistinguishabilities I1,2=0.520,
I2,3=0.540, and I1,3=0.643, respectively; in agreement
with independently measured indistinguishabilities via
two-photon interference on a 2× 2 beamsplitter, see Sup-
plementary Material. For the distinguishable sampler
(red bars), the theoretical distribution (empty bars) is
calculated by using Ii,j=0, ∀i, j in Eq. (1). To quantify
the agreement between theory and experiment, we em-
between nor-
malised theoretical and experimental distributions. For
our 2-photon BosonSampling, we ﬁnd an average ﬁ-
delity of F=0.9984±0.0007 across the six sampled distri-
butions in Fig. 2b, where the error here is one standard

FIG. 2. Two-photon BosonSampling. (a) Temporal-correlation measurements at no-collision outputs for 2 photons entering at
diﬀerent inputs. Coincidences around ∆t=0 (blue peaks) result from two-photon interference and are thus governed by Eq. (1).
The position of reduced areas (orange peaks) indicates the temporal distance in emission from the quantum-dot: For inputs
{1, 2}, and {2, 3}, photons were emitted after one laser repetition rate 1/RL=12.5 ns, thus reduced areas appear at ±1/RL;
similarly, appearing at ±25 ns for {1, 3}, with photons emitted separated by 2 laser repetition rates. Coincidences outside ∆t=0
(orange peaks and grey peaks) involve non-interfering photons, thus contain only classical information. (b) Coincidences at
zero delay from the 15 no-collision outputs give the distribution of the Boson Sampler (blue bars), with theoretical distributions
(empty bars) given by I1,2=0.520, I2,3=0.540, and I1,3=0.643, for their respective input; whereas coincidences outside zero delay
determine that of the distinguishable sampler (red bars), with theoretical distribution (empty bars) obtained by assuming zero
indistinguishability in Eq. (1). Note that strong output conﬁgurations in the classical sampler tend to have a larger reduction
when observed in the Boson Sampler. A complete sampled distribution is obtained with 10 minutes integration time; and, in
average, a total of ∼ 40000 2-fold events are collected for any given distribution. Error bars (small light-coloured bars) are
deduced from assuming poissonian statistics in detected events.

FIG. 3. Three-photon BosonSampling. (a) A total of 20 no-collision 3-fold simultaneous coincidences are recorded to obtain
the Boson Sampler distribution (blue bars); the theoretical distribution (empty bars) is obtained from Eq. (2) and by using the
previously determined pair-wise indistinguishability parameters. Error bars (light-coloured bars) are deduced from poissonian
statistics in measured events. We apply the validation of BosonSampling protocol against the uniform sampler (b), and
distinguishable sampler (c). A counter (blue dots) is updated for every 3-fold event and at any point a positive value validates
the data as being obtained from a BosonSampler as opposed to either a uniform or distinguishable sampler, see Methods.
The ﬁnal data set contains a total of 6725 3-fold events collected in 9 hours, that is ∼1000 per 80 minutes; outperforming
previous BosonSampling experiments with 3-fold rates of ∼1000 per 100 hours.

quantity that depends on the permanent, determinant,
and immanants of 3 × 3 submatrices T ; and the ρi,j,
and ˜ρ matrices as explicitly deﬁned in the Supplementary
Material. Eq. (2) reduces to p(3)=|per(T )|2 in the ideal
case of perfect indistinguishability between all particles,
i.e. Ii,j=1, ∀i, j.
Verifying the output distribution of a BosonSam-
pling device involves calculating a number of (modu-
lus squared) matrix permanents. This task is in gen-
eral computationally hard to implement eﬃciently on a
classical computer. The complete result of a large-scale
BosonSampling machine is thus likely to be, even in
principal, unveriﬁable. It has been even argued that a
large-scale BosonSampling experiment will fail to dis-
tinguish its data from the (trivial) uniform distribution—
i.e., one in which every output conﬁguration is equally
probable [41]. In light of this, some methods have been
proposed and demonstrated for the validation of Boson-
Sampling: circumstantial evidence is provided to sup-
port that a BosonSampling machine is indeed function-
ing according to the laws of quantum mechanics, by rul-
ing out that the experimentally obtained data originates
from, e.g., the uniform distribution, or a sampler with
distinguishable particles [19, 42–44]. These protocols are
scalable: it is not needed to observe all output conﬁgura-
tions, which grow exponentially with system size, instead
even modest numbers of multi-fold detected events reveal
the sampling nature of a device.

Figure 3 shows our experimental results for the

In Fig. 3a, the previously

as input for the theoretical distribution (empty bars)
according to Eq. (2), and experimental probabilities

collision events normalised to the theoretical prediction.

we apply the validation of BosonSampling protocol
to our data. We record 3-fold coincidences in steps of
30 seconds, in which time a counter is updated. For
each detected 3-fold coincidence, the counter is either
increased or decreased in one unit, and it is designed,
see Methods, such that after an experimental run a
positive value validates the data as obtained from the
Boson Sampler distribution, whereas a negative counter
indicates it originates from the uniform sampler, see
Fig. 3b, or the distinguishable sampler, see Fig. 3c.

Discussion
We experimentally demonstrated multi-photon inter-
ference with a highly-eﬃcient solid-state source: A
BosonSampling device
implemented with single-
photon Fock states emitted by a deterministic quantum

5

dot-micropillar system. The drastically high eﬃciency
of our source allowed us to sample interferometric
multimode outputs in time-scales 2 orders-of-magnitude
faster than in previous experiments with SPDC sources:
a representative number of 1000 3-fold sampled events,
obtained in ∼100 hours in previous experiments [6–9],
were collected here in 80 minutes. This performance
is attained despite using detectors with half the eﬃ-
ciency of those at down-conversion wavelengths, and an
inherently ineﬃcient demultiplexing approach.

We have directly observed the eﬀect of partial distin-
guishability: Our results follow closely the sampling of
permanents and immanants of matrices with contribu-
tions weighted by pair-wise degrees of indistinguishabil-
ity. Moreover, by exploiting temporal-correlation mea-
surements we showed that both classical and quantum
2-photon sampling distributions can be obtained simul-
taneously, which can be readily extended to multi-fold
temporal-dependent measurements in a larger Boson-
Sampling experiment. Potentially, this could motivate
new validation protocols exploiting statistics that include
this temporal degree of freedom.

The impact of partial distinguishability in Boson-
Sampling has been studied theoretically [40, 45, 46],
and reported experimentally [40]. However,
identify-
ing experimentally this property in isolation is challeng-
ing. Previous experiments with down-conversion exhibit
photon-statistics polluted by higher-order terms [23],
which can be mistakenly interpreted as decreased photon-
indistinguishability. In fact, in many cases these higher-
order terms, and not photon distinguishability, are the
main cause of performance degradation in SPDC-based
protocols [47, 48]. The pathway to maximise indistin-
guishability in eﬃcient solid-state sources is well known:
resonant excitation of the quantum-dot results in near-
optimal values of photon indistinguishability [32, 33], in
which case the obtained output distributions will be close
to the sampling of only permanents—functions belonging
to the #P complexity class, in which the main complexity
arguments of BosonSampling apply.

We believe our results pave the way to the forthcom-
ing advent of quantum-dot based quantum photonics,
in which a future BosonSampling implementation
with eﬃciently demultiplexed and resonantly-pumped
solid-state sources may ﬁnally see the Extended Church-
Turing thesis put to serious test.

Methods
Validation of BosonSampling.
Aaronson and
Arkhipov proposed a protocol to test data against
the uniform sampler [42], as a counterargument to the
claim [41] that a large-scale BosonSampling implemen-
tation would fail to distinguished the experimental data
even from that of the trivial one. The method—used in
Fig. 3b—exploits available information of the sampling
device—the transfer matrix L—to deﬁne an estimator

(cid:12)(cid:12)2

is a constant (uniform) value (cid:12)(cid:12)Li,j

, with Li,j the n×n submatrix
of the m×m transfer matrix in an experiment involving
n bosons in m modes. Unlike the permanent, Pest is eﬃ-
ciently computable—thus, the protocol is scalable—and
yet is correlated with the Boson Sampler probabilities.
For the uniform distribution, the probability of one
photon entering L in input i and exiting in output j
=1/m across any
input/output setting, thus the estimator takes the form
est= (n/m)n.
P u
If the sampling device is functioning
correctly, one expects to observe more probable events
more often; thus the method simply consists of comput-
ing Pest for every event observed, and keeping track of a
counter that is increased in one unit if Pest>P u
est, and
decreased in one unit otherwise. A resulting positive
counter then validates the BosonSampling experiment
by rejecting the hypothesis that the data originates
from the uniform sampler.
Experimental evidence
supporting that this method works, even with small data
samples and experimental imperfections, was reported
in refs. [43, 44].

A diﬀerent protocol to test the data against a distin-
guishable sampler was proposed and demonstrated by
Spagnolo et. al. [43]. This method—used in Fig. 3c—
exploits a key diﬀerence between sampling distinguish-
able or indistinguishable bosons: bosonic bunching. Out-
put conﬁgurations, within the no-collision space, that are
strong in classical distributions tend to have a larger re-
duction in probability when observed in the quantum
regime. As a result, the relative—i.e., normalised in
the no-collision space—probabilities pQ that are higher
within the quantum regime tend to be also numerically
higher than that probability in the classical regime pC:
if the data originates from a Boson Sampler one tends to
observe more conﬁgurations with pQ>pC. The method
then consists on computing pQ, and pC for every event
observed and keeping track of a counter increased in one
unit if pQ>pC, and decreased in one unit otherwise. At
the end of an experimental run a positive counter vali-
dates a correct functioning of the BosonSampling ma-
chine by rejecting the distinguishable sampler hypothesis.
The method is scalable: although it involves classically
computing permanents in pQ, this only needs to be done
for a limited number of observed events, and not for the
exponentially growing conﬁgurations of the entire output
distribution.

The linear network is characterised with the method
introduced in ref. [39]. For all measurements presented
in the main text, inputs 1, 2, and 3 of L are used. The

is taken as that at the global minimum in d. We obtain
I1,2=0.520, I2,3=0.540, and I1,3=0.643, see Fig.S 4.
We carried out time-correlated measurements of two-
photon interference on a 2 × 2 beam-splitter to inde-
pendently verify these degrees of indistinguishability. It
has been shown in ref. [34] that the indistinguishabil-
ity of two photons emitted by a semiconductor quan-

pared to photons emitted with the same polarisation, in
agreement with the obtained values.

III. Three-photon interference

We employ the theoretical model introduced in ref. [40]
to describe the interference of 3 photons, labeled 1, 2, and
3, scattered across a linear network L. In such case, the
probability of detecting a 3-fold coincidence at the output
{o1, o2, o3} of L is:

FIG. 4. Variation distance d between experimental and theoretical distributions. d is a global minimum at I1,2=0.520,
I2,3=0.540, and I1,3=0.643 for its corresponding 2-photon input. The variation distances at these points are respectively
d1,2=0.019, d2,3=0.037, and d1,3=0.023. These values are obtained with both experimental and theoretical distributions
normalised to the non-unity theoretical normalisation factor. When the distributions are normalised to unity, the variation
distances are d1,2=0.028, d2,3=0.049, and d1,3=0.055, respectively.

FIG. 5. Two-photon interference on a 2 × 2 beam-splitter. Temporal-correlation measurements result in a series of peaks
from which the degree of indistinguishability can be directly extracted via I=(R2+T 2 − A0/A)/(2RT ), with R=0.471 the
beam-splitter reﬂectance, T =1−R, A the average peak area outside ∆t=0 (excluding reduced peaks at ∆te), and A0 the peak
area around ∆t=0. See ref. [34] for a derivation of this formula. We obtain I bs
12.5ns=0.6360±0.0063 for ∆te=12.5 ns, and
I bs
25ns=0.6252±0.0065 for ∆te=25 ns. Errors are estimated from propagated poissonian statistics.
