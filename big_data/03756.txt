Observation of robust superconductivity in some of the iron based superconductors in the vicinity
of a Lifshitz point where a spin density wave instability is suppressed as the hole band drops below
the Fermi energy raise questions for spin-ﬂuctuation theories. Here we discuss spin-ﬂuctuation
pairing for a bilayer Hubbard model, which goes through such a Lifshitz transition. We ﬁnd s±
pairing with a transition temperature that peaks beyond the Lifshitz point and a gap function that
has essentially the same magnitude but opposite sign on the incipient hole band as it does on the
electron band that has a Fermi surface.

Theories in which pairing in the Fe-based super-
conductors arises from the scattering of pairs between
hole and electron pockets or between electron pock-
ets by spin-ﬂuctuations are challenged by the high Tc
superconductivity reported in mono-layer FeSe ﬁlms
grown on SrTiO3.[1–4] Scanning tunneling microscopy
experiments[5] as well as ARPES measurements[3, 6] on
these FeSe mono-layers ﬁnd that there are no hole pock-
ets. Furthermore, the ARPES measurements of the vari-
ation of the gap magnitude around the electron pock-
ets [6] makes the possibility of d-wave pairing, arising
from pair scattering between the electron pockets, un-
likely. However, these experiments also report the ex-
istence of an incipient hole band laying 50 to 100meV
below the Fermi energy, implying that the system is just
beyond a Lifshitz transition[7] where the hole Fermi sur-
face has disappeared. In addition, photoemission mea-
surements ﬁnd evidence that superconductivity occurs
in the monolayer FeSe ﬁlm, when SDW order is sup-
pressed by electron doping [3] and density functional the-
ory calculations[8] predict that in the absence of electron
doping, the ground state of the mono-layer FeSe ﬁlm
would have SDW order. Thus, it appears that super-
conductivity is induced in the FeSe mono-layer when the
SDW order is suppressed by a Lifshitz transition arising
from electron doping or strain[3]. Motivated by these
results, we have investigated the suppression of SDW or-
der and the onset of superconductivity near a Lifshitz
transition in a two-layer Hubbard model.

The Hamiltonian for the two layer Hubbard model that

we study is

Here c†
iσn/ciσn creates/annihilates a fermion with spin σ
in the nth layer (n=1 or 2). The intralayer hoping is t, the
interlayer hoping is t⊥ and µ is the chemical potential.

The band structure for this model is

ξk = 2t (cos kx + cos ky) − t⊥ cos kz − µ

(2)

with t⊥/t = 3.5 and µ set so that the site ﬁlling hni =
1.05 is shown in Fig. 1(a). If the ﬁlling is kept constant
as t⊥/t is increased, the system has a Lifshitz transition
such that for t⊥ > 3.67 the hole Fermi surface at the Γ
point disappears as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). We are in-
terested in studying the pairing for parameters such that
the spin density wave (SDW) instability is suppressed by
this Lifshitz transition.

In a random phase approximation (RPA) the spin sus-

ceptibility is given by

χRP A(q, Ωm) =

χ0(q, Ωm)

1 − U χ0(q, Ωm)

,

(3)

with

χ0(q, Ωm) =

T
N X

k,ωn

G0(k, ωn)G0(k + q, ωn + Ωm). (4)

Here T is the temperature, G0(k, ωn) = (iωn − ξk)−1
and ωn = (2n + 1)πT and Ωm = 2mπT are the usual
fermionic and bosonic Matsubara frequencies. For a ﬁxed
ﬁlling, as t⊥/t is increased and the Lifshitz transition
is approached, χ0 which peaks near wavevector (π, π, π)
decreases. For hni = 1.05, we take U = 2.4t so that
the SDW instability determined from Eq.
(3) is sup-
pressed by the Lifshitz transition as shown in Fig. 2.
With this suppression of the SDW order, one can imagine
that superconductivity may appear following the usual
paradigm. However, the Lifshitz transition that has sup-
pressed the SDW instability can also lead to a suppres-
sion of the s± pairing associated with the scattering of
pairs between the electron Fermi surface and the incipi-
ent hole band. For a ﬁxed pairing strength, Tc decreases
as the hole band moves below the Fermi energy[9].

Note that we keep the Fermi surface unchanged in the
dressed Green’s function. For hni = 1.05 and U = 2.4t,
the resulting value of Tc, interpolated from the temper-
ature at which λ crosses to 1, is plotted in Fig. 2 as
a function of t⊥/t. As shown in this ﬁgure, after the
SDW instability is suppressed by the Lifshitz transition,
a pairing transition occurs at a Tc which peaks as t⊥/t
increases and then falls oﬀ as the hole band is pushed
further below the Fermi energy.

The momentum dependence of the superconducting
gap function ∆(k, ω = πT ) ≡ Φ(k, πT )/Z(k, πT ) is
shown in Fig. 3. This is an A1g (s±) state in which the
sign of ∆ changes between kz = 0 and kz = π. One can
see that the magnitudes of the two gaps ∆(kx, ky, kz = 0)
and ∆(kx, ky, kz = π) are comparable even though the
hole band is below the Fermi energy.

In order to understand the peak in Tc that occurs as
the hole band drops below the Fermi energy, it is use-
ful to examine the dependence of Tc on the changes in
χ(q, Ωm) and G(k, ωn) that occur as t⊥/t increases be-
yond the Lifshitz transition. Viewing the Tc at which

the eigenvalue of Eq.
χ(k − k′) and the pair propagator G(k′, ω′
n),
we can calculate the variation in Tc due to the change in
χ when t⊥ increases by ∆t⊥,

We set ∆t⊥ = 0.01t. The results of the calculation are
shown in Fig. 4. Here one sees that the initial increase
in Tc arises from both the changes in χ and G. The
latter eﬀect is associated with an increase in the quasi-
particle spectral weight Z −1(k, ω) on the electron Fermi
surface that occurs as the hole band drops below the
Fermi energy. This increase in the quasi-particle spectral
weight initially ameliorates the decrease in Tc resulting
from the submergence of the hole band. The initial pos-
itive contribution associated with the variation in χ re-
ﬂects the change in the frequency structure of the spin-
ﬂuctuations. As the hole band drops below the Fermi
energy, a gap opens in the low energy qz = π spin ﬂuctu-
ation spectrum and spectral weight is transfered to higher
energies as shown in Fig. 5, which leads to stronger pair-
ing. The ultimate decrease in Tc is due to the decrease
of the pair propagator G(k′, ω′
n) as t⊥/t in-
creases and the hole band drops further below the Fermi
energy, as well as the decreasing strength of the spin-
ﬂuctuations.

To conclude, we have studied a two-layer Hubbard
model with parameters chosen so that a SDW instabil-
ity is suppressed by a Lifshitz transition in which a hole
band at the Γ point drops below the Fermi energy. Here,
we have kept the site ﬁlling ﬁxed and varied the inter-
layer hopping to tune the system through the Lifshitz
point. For a physical system this might by obtained via
strain[3]. Following the suppression of the SDW order,
we ﬁnd the onset of an s± superconducting state whose

FIG. 4. The variation of Tc with changes in χ (solid blue

versus t⊥/t. Here one sees that initially as t⊥/t increases
beyond 3.7 and the SDW order is suppressed, both the change
in χ and the change in GG lead to an increase in Tc. Then, as
t⊥/t increases further and the hole band drops deeper below
the Fermi energy, the changes in both χ and GG lead to a
reduction in Tc.

transition temperature Tc initially increases as the sys-
tem is pushed beyond the Lifshitz point by further in-
creasing t⊥/t. We ﬁnd that this increase in Tc is associ-
ated with both an increase in the quasi-particle spectral
weight and an increase in the strength of the pairing in-
teraction, which are related to the incipient hole band
and the resulting change in the spectral distribution of
the spin-ﬂuctuation. We ﬁnd that the gap function on the
incipient hole band is similar in magnitude but of the op-

the neutron scattering spectrum in the superconducting
state, which is related to the well known spin-resonance
