We perform density functional calculations to investigate the structure of the inter-metallic alloy
FeRh under epitaxial strain. Bulk FeRh exhibits a metamagnetic transition from a low-temperature
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase to a ferromagnetic (FM) phase at 350K, and its strain dependence
is of interest for tuning the transition temperature to the room-temperature operating conditions
of typical memory devices. We ﬁnd an unusually strong dependence of the structural energetics
on the choice of exchange-correlation functional, with the usual local density approximation (LDA)
yielding the wrong ground-state structure, and generalized gradient (GGA) extensions being in
better agreement with the bulk experimental structure. Using the GGA we show the existence of
a metastable face-centered-cubic (fcc)-like AFM structure that is reached from the ground state
body-centered-cubic (bcc) AFM structure by following the epitaxial Bain path. We predict that
this metastable fcc-like structure has a signiﬁcantly higher conductivity than the bcc AFM phase.
We show that the behavior is well described using non-linear elasticity theory, which captures the
softening and eventual sign change of the orthorhombic shear modulus under compressive strain,
consistent with this structural instability. Finally, we predict the existence of an additional unit-
cell-doubling lattice instability, which should be observable at low temperature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The inter-metallic compound FeRh exhibits an un-
usual ﬁrst-order phase transition from an antiferromag-
netic (AFM) structure at low temperature to a ferro-
magnetic (FM) structure above roughly 350 K1,2. The
phase transition is isostructural, with both phase having
the body-centered cubic (bcc) CsCl structure. The AFM
state (Fig. 1a) is characterised by magnetic moments at
the Fe sites of around 3µB and negligible moments at
the Rh sites, while the FM state (Fig. 1b) shows slightly
larger moments (around 3.3µB) on the Fe sites and Rh
3. The phase tran-
also acquires a moment of about 1µB
sition is accompanied by an increase in volume of about
1% and a large drop in resistivity2.

In recent years interest in FeRh has been rejuvenated
following its growth in thin-ﬁlm form, and the associ-
ated potential for integration into device architectures.
A number of technologically promising behaviors exploit-
ing the coupling between magnetism, resistivity and vol-
ume / strain have been demonstrated. These include
magnetic-ﬁeld writing with resistive reading in FeRh
ﬁlms grown on MgO4, small voltage switching between
5
AFM and FM states for FeRh on ferroelectric BaTiO3
and electric-ﬁeld phase and resistivity control for FeRh
on piezoelectric PMN-PT6.

A number of density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lations have already been performed to investigate the
properties of FeRh. Early work based on the local den-
sity approximation (LDA) studied the relative energet-
ics of diﬀerent magnetic phases and found the ground
state to be of type AFM-II (we will refer to this as AFM
in the following)7. At larger than equilibrium volumes
the FM state is energetically preferred within the LDA,
which is consistent with the volume increase associated

(AFM-II) and b) ferromagnetic order.

with the AFM to FM phase transition. Subsequent work
argued that in analogy to Fe, gradient corrected func-
tionals (GGA) are required for the correct description of
FeRh8.
It was shown that while LDA and GGA func-
tionals predict similar structures, the magnetic moments
on Fe in the AFM phase are signiﬁcantly larger and in
better agreement with experiment using GGA9. Later
work showed that close to the transition volume, the
Fe moments are unstable with respect to canting when
treated at the LDA level whereas a semi-local GGA func-
tional stabilises the collinear FM phase10. Using non-
collinear LDA calculations it was argued that the Rh
moment cannot be described within the Stoner picture
as the spin density shows spatial variations around the
Rh atom11. This study also established the importance
of strong Fe-Rh hybridisation and showed that the Fe-
Fe antiferromagnetic interaction is strongly volume de-
pendent, whereas the ferromagnetic Fe-Rh interaction re-
mains fairly constant with volume.

Following the recent interest in coherent epitaxial
strained FeRh ﬁlms, some density functional studies have
been carried out for strained systems. In terms of electri-
cal properties, DFT calculations suggested that injecting
holes does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the relative stability of
the AFM and the FM phases, whereas injecting about
0.4 electrons per formula unit makes the FM phase ener-
getically favourable compared to the AFM phase5. This
was conﬁrmed by calculations of the actual interface be-
tween ferroelectric BaTiO3 and FeRh, in which polarised
BaTiO3 injects electrons and leads to a favouring of the
FM state. The FM magnetic ordering was predicted to
have a signiﬁcantly higher density of states at the Fermi
energy, and hence a higher electrical conductivity, than
the AFM ordering5,6,10–12. No signiﬁcant change of the
density of states at the Fermi energy was found, however,
for small (±0.1 %) strain ranges6. It was also shown that
for very thin ﬁlms (9 layers) the FM state is energetically
favoured over the AFM state9.
Intriguingly, and rele-
vant for the work that we present here, Ref. 5 showed an
unusual energy lowering for the AFM phase under com-
pressive strain at the LDA level, although they did not
comment on its existence or its origin.

Here we report results of detailed DFT calculations of
the structure of FeRh under strain. We are motivated
in part by a lesser known experimental fact about FeRh,
namely that FeRh converts to a face-centered cubic (fcc)
structure when subjected to high velocity impact defor-
mation or other strong deformation such as ﬁling13,14.
The fcc structure reverts to the body-centered cubic (bcc)
FM CsCl structure on heating above 500K and ﬁnally to
the AFM structure when cooling to room temperature,
suggesting a Bain path transformation between the bcc
and fcc structures. Indeed, it has been shown using LDA
TB-LMTO calculations that the AFM fcc state has a
lower energy than the FM bcc state15, but a complete
investigation of the Bain path in the low temperature
AFM phase is lacking.

Our main ﬁnding is that epitaxial strain can con-
vert FeRh from the ground-state AFM bcc phase to a
metastable AFM fcc-like phase by following the epitaxial
Bain path. The behavior manifests in the non-linear elas-
tic constants as a softening of the orthorhombic shear dis-
tortion in the AFM phase under for compressive strain.
We show that the detailed energetics of the conversion is
strongly dependent on the choice of exchange-correlation
functional. Using the GGA, which yields better agree-
ment with experiment, the transition from bcc to fcc-like
structure has a very small energy barrier and the two
phases have very similar energies. We predict that the
conductivities of the two phases will be very diﬀerent,
based on their diﬀerent densities of states at the Fermi
energy. Finally, our calculations reveal a phonon instabil-
ity for the AFM bcc structure, which we predict will lead
to a dimerisation of both Fe and Rh at low temperature.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Our density functional theory calculations were per-
formed using the VASP code16–19 with both the LDA
and PBE20 density functionals. The inﬂuence of corre-
lations was studied using the DFT+U method21 by ap-
plying a rotationally invariant U on the Fe d states22.
Wave functions were expanded in plane waves up to a
kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 550 eV. PAW potentials23,24 with
Fe(4s, 3d, 3p) and Rh(5s, 4d, 4p) treated as valence elec-
trons were used. Reciprocal space was sampled using a
19x19x19 gamma-centred mesh for the 2 atom unit cell
and a 11x11x11 gamma-centred mesh for the 2x2x2 16
atom supercell. These values yield well-converged results
for forces, stress and phonon frequencies. Phonon calcu-
lations were performed using the frozen phonon method
in the phonopy code25. Biaxial strain was applied by con-
straining the length of two of the axes and varying the
length of the third axis to ﬁnd its lowest energy value.

III. RESULTS & DISCUSSION

A. Dependence of properties on the

exchange-correlation functional

Before proceeding to calculate the strain-dependent
structure of FeRh, we make an extensive comparison of
the properties obtained for the bulk system using diﬀer-
ent exchange-correlation functionals, both with literature
data from other DFT calculations, as well as with exper-
iment.

1. Structure and magetism

In ﬁgure 2 we show the energy vs. cubic lattice pa-
rameter for the non-magnetic (NM), antiferromagnetic
(AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases in the cubic CsCl
structure computed using the LDA (panel a) and GGA
(panel b). (Note that the NM case is obtained by not
allowing spin-polarization in the calculation.) Table I
compares our optimised lattice parameters and relative
energies with results of previously published calculations.
According to experiment, the FM phase has a larger
lattice parameter (2.999 Å) than the AFM phase (2.984
Å)3,26. We see this also realised in our results - indepen-
dent of the density functional - as well as all previous
computational studies. Also independent of the func-
tional, the AFM phase is predicted to have a lower energy
than the FM phase, a fact that was also reported by all
previous DFT studies and is in agreement with the exper-
imental low temperature AFM ground state. In general
the values obtained from our calculations agree with pre-
vious reports, the agreement being better for GGA, while
our LDA calculations predict around 6% smaller lattice
parameters than previous calculations. We notice, how-

treme sensitivity of the obtained lattice parameters to
the density functional and other details of the DFT cal-
culations. 2) The FM phase is predicted to be at least 46
meV per formula unit higher than the AFM phase, ex-
cept for the GGA calculations of Ref. 10 where an energy
diﬀerence of only 6 meV was found. Experimentally this
energy diﬀerence has been determined to be 5.34 meV
per formula unit27, which shows that in general DFT
calculations tend to overestimate this energy diﬀerence.
3) Under compression, both functionals tend towards a
cross-over to a non-magnetic state, indicating the pres-
ence of a magneto-volume eﬀect.

ever, that very similar lattice parameters to ours were
found by the most recent LDA study5.

In table I we also report the predicted magnetic mo-
ments. Our computed moments agree well with previ-
ously reported values at the LDA7,10 and GGA8–10 level,
where values of around 3 µB for the Fe and 1 µB for the
Rh moments where reported. These data show that the
computed LDA local Fe magnetic moments are about 0.2
to 0.3 µB smaller than the GGA values for both the AFM
and FM phase.

We make three observations at this point: 1) There
is a spread of -6.6% to +2.5% with respect to experi-
ment in the LDA lattice parameters and from -1.0% to
+2.1% in the GGA lattice parameters respectively. A
general rule of thumb is that LDA systematically under-
estimates lattice parameters, while GGA overestimates
them. This rule is not observed here, hinting at an ex-

To further asses the performance of diﬀerent den-
sity functionals, we report in table II the elastic con-
stants computed by ﬁtting to isostatic as well as volume-
conserving orthorhombic and tetragonal strain in a range
of -5 to +5%28. We show values for the FM and AFM
phases, as well as NM for completeness. For the AFM
phase at the LDA level, the range had to be reduced
to -2.5% to +2.5% in order to obtain a good ﬁt in
the orthorhombic strain case, hinting already that these
second-order elastic constants do not fully capture the
elastic behavior of FeRh and that we might anticipate
unusual strain-dependent behavior.

Experimentally, the AFM phase (ground state in a
Fe0.98Rh1.02 alloy) was measured to have a slightly higher
bulk modulus of 141 GPa than the FM phase (ground
state in Fe1.04Rh0.96) with 133 GPa29. Despite the
slightly diﬀerent composition, we expect the elastic con-

stants in Fe1.00Rh1.00 to be comparable. Our predicted
bulk moduli are higher than these experimental values,
especially at the LDA level, where the values are over-
estimated by a factor of 1.60 and 1.74 respectively for
the AFM and FM phases. The GGA predictions are
closer to experiment but still overestimate by a factor
1.36 and 1.45 respectively. Despite this overestimation,
it is encouraging that the AFM phase is predicted to
have a higher bulk modulus than the FM phase. Our
results are also consistent with previous predictions at
the LDA level (AFM: 214.4 GPa7, 226.8 GPa12, 245.4
GPa10; FM: 201.6 GPa7, 244.0 GPa12, 236.4 GPa10) as
well as the GGA level (AFM: 197 GPa8, 219.4 GPa10;
FM: 193 GPa8, 218.1 GPa10).

The data in table II have two particularly interesting
implications, given that a material is elastically stable
only when C11 − C12 > 0. First, we see that, indepen-
dent of the functional, the NM phase does not satisfy this
criterion and is hence elastically unstable, implying that
FeRh is in fact structurally stabilized by its magnetic in-
teractions. It is somewhat surprising, however, that the
AFM phase is also elastically unstable when using the
LDA functional whereas it is stable using GGA. This in-
complete stabilization could be attributed to the smaller
magnetic moments, which yield reduced magnetic inter-
actions at the LDA level. The FM phase on the other
hand is elastically stable independent of the functional.
We conclude at this point that based on structural pa-
rameters, elastic properties and size of the magnetic mo-
ments, the GGA yields a better description of bulk FeRh
than the LDA. In what follows, therefore we use PBE-
GGA exclusively for calculating the strain-dependent
structure. Since we focus on the ground-state AFM or-
dering, the overestimate of the energy diﬀerence to the
FM phase, which is one inherent problem of the PBE
functional, will not aﬀect our conclusions, but we em-
phasize that care should be taken when considering the

relative stability of the diﬀerent magnetic orderings using
DFT calculations.

B. Epitaxial strain dependence

√

In ﬁgure 3 a) we show the energy evolution of the AFM
phase as a function of epitaxial strain for the PBE func-
tional and for sake of completeness also for the LDA
functional. While under tensile strain both functionals
predict the expected approximately quadratic increase
in energy with increasing strain, the functionals behave
markedly diﬀerently under compressive strain.

Using LDA (Fig. 3b), the bcc CsCl structure of the
AFM phase is merely an inﬂection point in the energy
landscape and we observe a signiﬁcant energy lowering
under compressive epitaxial strain, which is a manifes-
tation of the negative C11 − C12 value reported in ta-
ble II. A similar energy evolution was previously shown
but not commented upon5. Accompanying the reduction
in energy is an increase in the c/a ratio (Fig. 3b) to-
wards
2 = 1.414, indicating that a transition along the
tetragonal Bain path has taken FeRh from the bcc CsCl
structure to an fcc-like structure.

At the GGA level (Fig. 3a), which we concluded above
yields a better description of FeRh, the energy of the
AFM phase increases under compressive strain and the
bcc CsCl structure is predicted to be the ground state.
There exists however a metastable state at -7% strain,
only 3 meV/f.u. higher in energy than the bcc CsCl struc-
ture and reached from the bcc phase by overcoming a
small energy barrier of 5 meV/f.u. This is in agreement
with the experimental ﬁnding that plastic deformation
can induce a transformation from bcc to fcc, which is
reversed upon heating13,14.

Another implication of this result is that FeRh should
exhibit a very non-standard behaviour under compressive
strain. At 0% strain and around 7% strain, one should
consider the material unstrained, but existing in two dis-
tinct phases (bcc and fcc-like respectively). If grown at
intermediate strains, the material could relax into either
of the two phases as the ﬁlm grows thicker, which could
lead to phase coexistence in partially relaxed ﬁlms, rem-
30.
iniscent of the diﬀerent phases occurring in BiFeO3
Fig. 3c) reveals that the volume change is minimal for
the strain range encompassing the two energy minima,
further supporting a phase coexistence scenario.

In Fig. 4 we show the GGA computed electronic den-
sities of states (DOSs) for the bcc a) FM and b) AFM
phases respectively as well as c) the metastable fcc-like
AFM structure at 7% compressive strain. All DOSs are
reported per formula unit of FeRh so that the DOS at the
Fermi energy can be directly compared for the diﬀerent
structures. The much larger DOS at the Fermi energy
for the bcc FM phase compared to the bcc AFM phase
is in agreement with previous calculations8–10. Compar-
ing the DOS for the metastable fcc-like AFM structure
(Fig. 4c) it is interesting to note that this structure has

5

phases.

vanishes for compressive strain slightly below 7%.

The amount of strain where the instability is maxi-
mal as well as where it vanishes are in surprisingly good
agreement with the position of the top of the energy
barrier and the metastable minimum respectively of the
energy curve in Fig. 3a).
It is known that Bain path
transitions can be linked to unstable phonon modes31,
however in the present case, the instability appears only
in a small portion of q-space around the R-point. Such
zone-boundary instabilities cannot be invoked to explain
a Bain path transition, which relies on unstable long
wave-length phonons31. We have veriﬁed that no long
wave-length instability exists along the R-Γ line, which
could mean that the strain match might be a coincidence.
Nevertheless it is interesting to note that both the present
R-point instability as well as an elastic C(cid:48) instability are
represented by transverse [110] modes.

In Fig. 5d) we show the structural distortion associ-
ated with this instability condensed at its most energy-
lowering amplitude for the 5% compressively strained
structure. We see that it corresponds to a dimerisation of
the Rh atoms along the ﬁlm normal and a dimerisation of
the Fe atoms in the strain plane. The distortion results
in an energy lowering of 10.8 meV per FeRh formula unit
at this strain value. In the unstrained cubic bcc struc-
ture the energy lowering is about two orders of magnitude
smaller at only 0.125 meV per formula unit. This small
energy scale suggests that the occurrence of this phe-
nomenon should be limited to very low temperatures,
consistent with this structure not yet having been ob-
served in experiment. Compressive strain could however
trigger the dimerisation at higher temperatures. In terms
of electrical properties, the unstable phonon has the ef-
fect of slightly lowering the DOS at the Fermi energy, at
5% compressive strain going from 0.6 states/eV/f.u.

almost as large a DOS at the Fermi energy as the FM
phase, when considering both up and down spin elec-
trons. An enhancement of the DOS at the Fermi energy
was previously predicted to occur in the FM phase under
compressive strain15. Here we predict that a change from
the AFM bcc to the AFM fcc-like structure will result in
a change in resistivity comparable to that accompanying
the AFM-FM phase transition.

In addition to this elastic instability that manifests un-
der compressive strain, our calculations reveal a lattice
instability in the AFM phase corresponding to dimerisa-
tions of Fe and Rh atoms along perpendicular directions.
In in Fig. 5a) we show the evolution of the phonon spec-
trum, computed using GGA-PBE, as a function of strain.
It can be seen that at 0% strain a lattice instability ex-
ists at the degenerate M and R points that manifests as
an imaginary phonon frequency. Compressive strain lifts
the degeneracy of the M and R point and rapidly sup-
presses this instability at the M point (wave-vector in
the compressively strained plane, see Fig. 5c) while it is
enhanced at the R point (wave-vector with a component
along the elongated out-of-plane axis). In Fig. 5b) we
show the evolution of this R-point frequency with strain.
The instability is initially enhanced up to compressive
strains of 3 to 4% and is then rapidly suppressed and

describe the inter-metallic compound FeRh in a density
functional theory calculation.

C. Non-linear elasticity

Finally we analyze the anomalous elastic behaviour of
the AFM state under compressive epitaxial strain seen
in Fig. 3a in the framework of non-linear elasticity. In
particular, we investigate how the linear elastic constant
C(cid:48) = (C11 − C12)/2 varies with strain, and which or-
ders in the energy expansion we need to include in or-
der to give a good description of the equilibrium AFM
state and the surrounding saddle point region. Our main
ﬁndings are ﬁrst an unusually strong dependence of the
linear elastic constants with strain, with C(cid:48) undergoing
a strong softening under compression, and second that
elastic constants up to ﬁfth order are required to describe
the elastic energy surface. These results conﬁrm that the
ground state of FeRh is proximal to an elastic instability.
Using the GGA exchange-correlation functional that
we established above to give the best description of FeRh,
we performed two series of deformations to extract the
elastic constants: First an isotropic volume distortion
followed by either a volume-conserving monoclinic or or-
thorhombic distortion28. This allowed us to express the
tension/compression asymmetry, which is normally ﬁt-
ted to a Murnaghan-Birch ﬁt32,33, directly in terms of
the higher order elastic constants:

in the

Finally for this section, we present results of computer
experiments to test the role of the size of the magnetic
moments in determining the stability of the AFM phase
with respect to epitaxial tetragonal strain. In order to
check if a further increase of the moments would lead to
a complete stabilisation of the AFM phase, we apply an
on-site Hubbard U correction to the Fe d orbitals. We
emphasize that we do not propose this as a good physical
description of FeRh, but use it as a computational trick to
tune the magnitude of the magnetic moments by mod-
ifying the charge localisation on the Fe atoms. In Fig.
6a), we show the evolution of the energy as a function
of strain for diﬀerent values of U added to a GGA calcu-
lation. As shown above, without this artiﬁcial increase
of the moments (U=0.00 eV), the secondary minimum of
slightly higher energy exists for compressive strain. Upon
increasing U, the secondary minimum disappears around
U∼0.25 eV, but remains visible as a kink in the energy
curve. As is to be expected, increasing U increases the
magnitude of the magnetic moments as shown in Fig.
6b). Going from U=0 eV to 1 eV, increases the moments
by 0.2 µB and more. This conﬁrms indeed that increas-
ing the magnetic moments will completely stabilise the
CsCl structure with respect to tetragonal strain.

Our ﬁndings also conﬁrm our assertion that the addi-
tion of a Hubbard U correction is not a physically appro-
priate description. As we mentioned in the introduction,
experimental evidence supports the existence of an fcc
phase, which can be reached by high energetic deforma-
tions of the material13,14. However, addition of a U >
0.25 to the GGA functional suppresses this state com-
pletely. This leads us to believe that semi-local function-
als without any on-site correction are the best choice to

non-linear elasticity theory see the Appendix). Second,
we performed an isotropic in-plane distortion (ε1) plus
a perpendicular out-of-plane distortion (ε2), correspond-
ing to a biaxial strain state. We then ﬁt the non-linear
elastic energy expression, Eqn. A5, to our DFT database
of energies versus distortions using a simulated annealing
algorithm34. The resulting optimal numerical values of
the non-linear elastic constants are listed in Tab. III. Note
that the chosen distortions do not directly probe all elas-
tic constants. For example C456, C1456, C4455, C11456,
C12456, C14455, C15566 and C44456 do not contribute to
the elastic energies and are therefore omitted from the
ﬁtting process, and others enter only in linear combina-
tions (for example, see Eqns. 1 and 2). Thus caution
should be taken in interpreting the numerical values of
individual higher-order elastic constants. For conciseness
we present results only for the AFM phase.

Fig. 7a shows the change in elastic energy as a func-
tion of the volume-conserving orthorhombic distortion for
diﬀerent isotropic strains. Both the DFT data and the
non-linear elasticity ﬁt are shown, where the zero energy
(at zero orthorhombic strain) is set to the AFM energy
per formula unit of the given isotropic strain. We see that
the C(cid:48) shear modulus changes as a function of isotropic
strain (as does the C44 shear modulus — not shown).
In particular there is a strong softening of the C(cid:48) modu-
lus at negative isotropic strains (corresponding to lattice
contraction). For the FM phase, no softening of the FM
C(cid:48) modulus under isotropic compression was seen and for
the NM phase, the C(cid:48) modulus was always negative indi-
cating a broad regime of elastic instability as suggested
by sec. III A 2.

FIG. 7. a) Change in elastic energy (per formula unit) at
a ﬁnite isotropic strain with respect to a volume conserving
orthorhombic strain for the AFM FeRh system. For each color
the points show the DFT data and the lines the eqn. A5 ﬁt
for a speciﬁc value of isotropic strain. b) Dependence of the
AFM shear moduli C(cid:48) on isotropic strain according to eqn. 2.
Here diﬀerent orders with respect to the isotropic strain are
shown. Convergence under compression is achieved at fourth
order.

Insight into the origin of this behavior can be gained
by writing down the isotropic strain dependence of the
C(cid:48) elastic constant in terms of the higher order elastic
constants. Up to quadratic order with respect to the
isotropic strain, η, this is
(C11 − C12) +
(6C11 + C111 − C123) η +

A similar expression for the C44 constant can also be
obtained.
Inspection of Eqn. 2 reveals that the higher

order elastic constants strongly aﬀect each coeﬃcient of
the η expansion. Not shown are the η3 and η4 terms,
which include respectively the fourth and ﬁfth order or-

contributions up to fourth order in η using the obtained
numerical elastic constants for the AFM state for a range
of negative and positive isotropic strains. We see again
that, consistent with Fig. 7a, C(cid:48) softens on lattice con-
traction, eventually becoming negative at an isotropic
strain of approximately -5%. Thus under a suﬃciently
large isotropic compression the AFM state becomes un-
stable to an orthorhombic distortion. For the considered
range of isotropic compressions, this trend is not seen in
the FM phase.

Finally we note that the elastic constant behaviour of
FeRh is remarkably similar to that of pure bcc Fe, which
also exhibits a C(cid:48) softening to zero under compression,
and has a negative C(cid:48) for the NM phase. For bcc Fe,
this phenomenon is associated with the suppression of
itinerant magnetism under compression, and it has been
pointed out that this is a manifestation of the magneto-
volume eﬀect35–37. As we pointed out earlier, (Fig. 2)
the energies of the AFM, FM and NM phases tend to the
same values for suﬃciently high compressions, and this is
accompanied by a reduction in the size of the magnetic
moments. For example, at an isotropic compression of
5%, the individual Fe moment values of the AFM FeRh
phase are lower than their equilibrium values by approx-

8

imately 10%.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have shown that the GGA exchange-
correlation functional provides a reasonable description
of the known properties of FeRh, in contrast to the LDA
which predicts incorrectly that a competing fcc-like phase
with smaller lattice constant is the ground state, and the
GGA+U method which incorrectly completely destabi-
lizes this competing phase. At the GGA level the fcc-
like state is metastable, consistent with reports of its ex-
istence under high-impact deformation, and we predict
that it can be reached with compressive epitaxial strain.
Due to an enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy,
this fcc-like state shows a decreased electrical resistivity
compared to the bcc AFM phase. We rationalize the be-
havior using non-linear elasticity theory, and predict the
existence of a lattice instability, which should manifest
at low temperatures as a dimerisation of both Fe and Rh
atoms along perpendicular directions.

Appendix A: Non-linear elasticity: deﬁnitions and

ﬁtting procedure

Non-linear elasticity expands the elastic energy to
supralinear order with respect to the deformation ma-
trix, and thus deﬁnes higher than linear order elastic

coeﬃcients. Unlike linear elasticity, non-linear elastic-
ity involves ﬁnite distortions of a material and therefore
allows for the study of C(cid:48) and C44 as a function of an ar-
bitrary distortion. Here we outline non-linear elasticity
theory to ﬁfth order.

The higher order elastic constants depend on the pre-
cise deﬁnition of strain. Here the Lagrangian strain is
used, which gives a measure of the ﬁnite displacement of
a material point38–40. The Lagrangian strain is formally
deﬁned as

(cid:0)JJT − 1(cid:1) ,

(A1)
where the Jacobian matrix, J, is obtained from the linear
strain tensor,

η =

J = 1 + ε.

Thus the Lagrangian strain is
