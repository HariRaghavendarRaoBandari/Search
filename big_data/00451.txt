Recently, there are ground breaking experimental advances in generating 2 dimensional spin-
orbit coupling (SOC) for cold atoms in both continuum and optical lattices. The possible heating
issues in these experiments are well under control, novel magnetic phenomena due to the interplay
between SOC and strong interactions are ready to be investigated. One typical experiment set-up
is to load spinor bosons at integer ﬁllings in an optical lattice subject to a 2d SOC. In the strong
coupling limit, it leads to the Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model (RFHM) which is a new
class of quantum spin models to describe quantum magnetisms in cold atoms or some materials with
strong SOC. In a previous work, we investigate various quantum phenomena of the RFHM along a
solvable line in the SOC parameter space. In this paper, starting from the results achieved along
the solvable line, we study the RFHM in the whole SOC parameter space. Its global phase diagram
displays many novel quantum phenomena such as masses generated from ”order from disorder ”
mechanism, quantum commensurate ( C ) and In-commensurate ( IC ) skyrmion phases, quantum
Lifshitz C-IC transitions, spiral phases, metastable states, hysteresis, devil staircases and fractals,
etc. Connections to the classical Frenkel-Kontorowa (FK) model are explored. Implications to cold
atom systems and so called Kitaev materials with SOC are discussed. Various intriguing perspectives
are outlined.

Extensive research have been lavished to quantum spin
systems with spin SU (2) symmetry in various bi-partite
and frustrated lattices [1–3] or disordered systems [4–7].
One of the current trends is to study the eﬀects of various
kinds of spin-orbit couplings (SOC) [8] in quantum spin
systems [9–11]. Indeed, the investigation and control of
SOC have become the subjects of intensive research in
both condensed matter and cold atom systems after the
discovery of the topological insulators [12, 13].
In the
condensed matter side, there are increasing number of
new quantum materials with signiﬁcant SOC, including
several new 5d transition metal oxides and heterostruc-
tures of transition metal systems [10, 11].
In the cold
atom side, there are very recent ground breaking exper-
imental advances in generating 2d Rashba SOC for cold
atoms in both continuum and optical lattices [14–17].
Generating the 2d SOC is a tremendous advance over
the 1d SOC generated in previous experiments ( for a re-
view, see [18] ), while generalizing 2d SOC to 3d SOC in
these experiments is straightforward. The possible heat-
ing issues in these experiments [14–17] are well under
control, novel magnetic phenomena due to the interplay
between SOC and strong interactions are ready to be in-
vestigated in near future experiments on both fermion
and spinor BEC. It becomes topical and important to in-
vestigate what would be new magnetic phenomena due
to such an interplay in both cold atoms and condensed
matter systems.

In a recent work [19], we studied interacting spinor
bosons at integer ﬁllings loaded in a square optical lat-

tice in the presence of non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds. In the
strong coupling limit, it leads to the Rotated Ferromag-
netic Heisenberg model (RFHM) which is a new class of
quantum spin models to describe quantum magnetisms
in some systems with strong SOC [20–22]. Along a solv-
able line, we identiﬁed an exact spin-orbital entangled
commensurate ground state: the Y-x state. It supports
not only commensurate magnons (C-C0,C-Cπ), but also
a new gapped elementary excitation:
in-commensurate
magnon (C-IC). The existence of the C-IC above a com-
mensurate phase is a salient feature of the RFHM. How-
ever, these magnons are non-relativistic, not embedded
in the ground state and need to be thermally excited.
Under various external probes which introduce quantum
ﬂuctuations into the ground state, they maybe dragged
out and become the seeds to drive possible new classes
of quantum commensurate to In-Commensurate ( C-IC
) transitions. Their dramatic eﬀects under the longitudi-
nal hy and the two transverse ﬁelds hx, hz were throughly
addressed in [23] and [24] respectively. However, the ulti-
mate goal is to investigate the global quantum phenom-
ena in the whole SOC parameter space (α, β) which are
experimentally tunable. We try to achieve such a goal
in this paper. Our main results summarized in the Fig.1
demonstrate that quantum spin systems with SOC opens
a new avenue to explore whole new classes of quantum
commensurate and in-commensurate phases, excitations
and quantum C-IC phase transitions, which may have
wide implications in cold atoms and various materials
with SOC to be discussed near to the end of the paper.

Firstly, starting from the results achieved along the
solvable line (α = π/2, β) [19], we study the RFHM
away from the line until reaching the Rashba limit α = β
where the Hamiltonian has an enlarged spin-orbital cou-
pled C4 × C4 symmetry. Our results are shown in Fig.1.
Any small π/2 − α > 0 introduces quantum ﬂuctua-
tions into the quantum ground state, the classical ground
state remains the Y-x state. The C-C0, C-IC and C-Cπ
magnons all become gapped relativistic quasi-particles,
sneak into the quantum ground states and dominate all
the physical quantities at low temperatures in the Y-
x state. As the π/2 − α increases further, at the Lin-
ear Spin Wave (LSW) order, following the constant con-
tour lines of the C-C0, C-IC and C-Cπ, the Y-x state is
expected to turn into two commensurate phases in the
C-C0 and C-Cπ regimes, some in-commensurate phases
in the C-Cπ regime through the condensations of these
magnons. However, all the C-C0 regime and the C-IC
regime with 0 < k0
y < 2π/3 are pre-emptied by some
in-commensurate phases through a ﬁrst-order transition
line. This line is determined by comparing the classical
ground state energy of the Y-x state with those of the
in-commensurate phases determined from the Frenkel-
Kontorowa (FK) model. So the Y-x state becomes only a
meta-stable state ( just a local minimum in energy land-
scapes ) between the ﬁrst-order transition line and the
putative 2nd-order condensation boundary of the C-C0
and the C-IC magnons.

Secondly, along the diagonal line α = β, we ﬁnd there
is family of U (1) classically degenerate 2× 2 vortex state
in Fig.2 which is a FM state within the XY plane in the
rotated ˜˜SU (2) basis at the Abelian point α = β = π/2.
When performing LSW on the classical degenerate mani-
fold, we ﬁnd the quantum ﬂuctuations at the LSW order
pick up either Y-x state or the X-y state as the quantum
ground state which are related by the C4 × C4 symme-
try. This is manifestation of the ”order from disorder ”
mechanism [2] of previously studied geometrically frus-
trated spin systems in a SOC lattice system. Then we
perform a spin coherent state path-integral calculation
to ﬁnd the gap ∆B opening at ~k = (0, π) along the di-
agonal line. So the spurious relativistic gapless magnons
found at the LSW order acquires a mass ∆B which in-
creases as moving away from the Abelian point. There is
a quantum Lifshitz C-IC transition from the Y-x phase
to an incommensurate phase at α = αic with the 4 or-
bital order wave-vectors (0,±(π−qic)) and (π,±(π−qic))
where qic = (∆B/u)1/2 is the on-set IC orbital order. The
spin structure of this IC phase remains to be determined.
It should be a IC non-coplanar Skyrmion crystal phase
which we name as IC-SkX/Y-x phase. Similarly, starting
form the X-y phase, one can reach the IC-SkX/X-y phase
with the 4 orbital order wave-vectors (±(π − k0
x), 0) and
(±(π − k0

x), π).

Along the diagonal line α = β, by performing classical

2

minimization calculations, we ﬁnd a stable commensu-
rate 3 × 3 non-coplanar SkX phase which respects the
C4 × C4 symmetry. We also determine a putative ﬁrst
order transition point between the non-coplanar SkX and
the collinear Y-x phase at α33. This point is outside
the above quantum Lifshitz transition point α33 < αic.
This fact indicates this putative ﬁrst order transition
must split into two second order transitions with the IC-
SkX/Y-x phase intervening between the 3× 3 SkX phase
and the Y-x phase along the diagonal line. This picture
is further conﬁrmed by the approach from the solvable
line on the right: there is a Y-x state to the IC-SkX/Y-
x phase through the condensations of the C-IC magnons
with 2π/3 < k0
y < π−qic. The diagonal line is the ﬁrst or-
der transition line between the Y-x and X-y phase when
αic < α < π/2 and the IC-SkX/Y-x and IC-SkX/X-y
when α33 < α < αic. So along the diagonal line, there is
any ratio of mixtures of the Y-x and X-y and IC-SkX/Y-
x and IC-SkX/X-y in the two regimes respectively. The
Y-x state becomes only a meta-stable state ( just a local
minimum in energy landscapes ) between the ﬁrst or-
der transition line αic < α < π/2 and the condensation
boundaries of the C-Cπ and C-IC with a tiny window
π − qic < k0
y < π. We extend our calculations to other
simple robust commensurate points α = π/3, π/4, π/5.....
We ﬁnd 3 × 3 is the only co-planar state along the diag-
onal line.
Thirdly, we approach the diagonal line α = β ( the
Rashba limit ) from the bottom Abelian line 0 < α <
˜SU (2) symmetric in the
π/2, β = 0 which becomes
˜SU (2) basis ˜Sn = R(ˆx, 2αn)Sn. At α = π/N, N =
2, 3, 4, 5, 6,··· , we consider a N × 1 spin-orbital structure
commensurate with a lattice with N×M lattice sites. We
reach the incommensurate limit by taking N → ∞ limit.
Any small β < α = π/N breaks the ˜SU (2) symmetry and
selects a co-planar state in Y Z plane. We establish the
classical phase diagram by mapping the systems’s clas-
sical energy functional to the Frenkel-Kontorowa (FK)
model. Near the Abelian point α = β = 0, the system
ends up in some IC phases instead of any commensurate
phases.

The combinations of the approach from the solvable
line (α = π/2, β), the diagonal line ( the Rashba limit )
0 < α = β < π/2 and the Abelian line 0 < α < π/2, β =
0 leads to rather complete understanding of the global
quantum phenomena in the whole SOC parameter space
(α, β). Near to the end, we discuss the implications of our
results on cold atom systems and so called Kitaev mate-
rials with SOC. Some possible far-reaching perspectives
are given.

The RFHM [19] at a generic SOC parameters (α, β) is

FIG. 1.
Phase diagram of the RFHM at a generic (α, β)
in a square lattice. Along the diagonal line away from the
α = β = π/2 Abelian point, there is a quantum Lifshitz tran-
sition at α = αin with the dynamic exponent z = 1, from
the collinear Y-x ( or X-y ) phase to the IC-SkX/Y-x ( or
IC-SkX/X-y ) phase, then a second one from the IC-SkX/Y-
x to the commensurate 3 × 3 SkX crystal phase at α = α33.
It is a bi-critical point where the two second order transition
lines from the 3 × 3 SkX to the IC-SkX/Y-x below the di-
agonal line and to the IC-SkX/X-y above the diagonal line
meet the ﬁrst order transition line between the IC-SkX/Y-x
and IC-SkX/X-y along the diagonal line. M is the multicrit-
ical point located at (αM , βM ) where the (0, ±2π/3) counter
line of the Y-x phase hits the corner of the 3 × 3 SkX crys-
tal. The Y-x state becomes metastable between the ﬁrst or-
der transition line and the second order transition ( dashed )
line due to the condensations of the C − C0 and C-IC with
0 < k0
y < 2π/3. There is a second order transition from the
Y-x phase to the IC-SkX/Y-x phase driven by the conden-
sations of C-IC with 2π/3 < k0
y < π − qic. The Y-x state
becomes metastable again between the ﬁrst order transition (
diagonal ) line and the second order transition ( dashed ) line
( due to the gap opening generated by the order from disor-
der mechanism ) driven by the condensations of the C − Cπ
and C-IC with π − qic < k0
y < π. The devil’s staircases at
β < α = π(1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, ....) = π/N can be obtained
by mapping the N × 1 ansatz into the FK model Eqn.13. The
3×3 SkX is the only non-coplanar commensurate phase along
the diagonal line. All the other regimes are ﬁrst order tran-
sition lines between N × 1 and 1 × N co-planar phase after
N ≥ 4. The IC means in-commensurate phases. Inside the
IC phase, there could also some small devil staircases ( such
as at 2π/5, 2π/7...... ) displaying fractal structures. There is
spurious Mirror symmetry about β = π/4 at the LSW or-
der, but it was spoiled by higher order terms. There are
order from disorder and mass generation phenomena along
α = β, but not along its mirror image α = π/2 − β. The
· · · means that this devil staircase series ends to some IC
phases near the origin α = β = 0. The relevant numbers are

strategy. We ﬁrst explore new and rich quantum phe-
nomena along the solvable line α = π/2, 0 < β < π/2.

Then starting from the deep knowledge along the solvable
line, we will try to investigate the quantum phenomena
at generic (α, β). The ﬁrst step has been achieved in [19],
here, we will achieve the second step. This strategy has
been successful in solving several strongly coupled models
such as Kondo model [25–27] and quantum dimer model
[28, 29].

The RFHM at generic (α, β) has the translational, the
time reversal T , the three spin-orbital coupled Z2 sym-
metries Px,Py,Pz symmetries. Along the solvable line
α = π/2, 0 < β < π/2, as shown in [19, 23], there
is a hidden spin-orbital coupled U (1) symmetry gen-
erated by U1(φ) = eiφ Pi(−1)xSz
i and also the Mirror
symmetry M which consists of the local rotation ˜Si =
R(ˆx, π)R(ˆz, πn2)Si followed by a Time reversal transfor-
mation T , (β, h) → (π/2− β, h). However, any deviation
from the solvable line α 6= π/2 spoils the U (1) symmetry
and the Mirror symmetry. Along the diagonal line α = β,
the Pz symmetry is enlarged to the spin-orbital coupled
C4 × C4 symmetry around the z axis. Of course, along
the bottom Abelian line 0 < α < π/2, β = 0, it has the
˜SU (2) symmetry in the ˜SU (2) basis ˜Sn = R(ˆx, 2αn)Sn.
Because β < α lower-half is related to the β > α upper
half in Fig.1 by the C4 × C4 transformation, so in the
following, we mainly focus on the lower half. We will
approach the global phase diagram Fig.1 from all the
three lines: the solvable line α = π/2, 0 < β < π/2, the
Abelian line 0 < α < π/2, β = 0 and the diagonal line
0 < α = β < π/2.

Naively, the RFHM may not be useful to describe the
magnetism in so called Kitaev materials such as Iridates
or Osmates [11]. However, as shown in [19, 23], the
RFHM can be expanded as Heisenberg- ferromagnetic
Kitaev-DM form with a dominant FM Kitave term which
is indeed the case in these materials. Although the FM
Kitave sign in these materials may originate from the
Hunds rules instead of the spinor bosonic nature of the
underlying microscopic models. Some applications of the
RFHM to these materials have been discussed in [23] and
will be discussed further near to the end of this paper.

Excitation spectra in the Y-x state.

The
ﬁrmly established results and physical insights [19, 23, 24]
achieved on the solvable line (α = π/2, α < β) pave the
way to study the physics at generic (α, β) in Fig.1. Es-
pecially, we will follow how the three kinds of magnons
response and evolve when moving away from the solvable
line.

Making a globe rotation Rx(π/2) to align spin along
the Z-axis and then introducing Holstein-Primakoﬀ
bosons a and b for the two sublattice, we can expand
the Hamiltonian in the powers of 1/√S,
√S(cid:17)2
√S(cid:17)H3 +(cid:16) 1
H = E0 + 2JShH2 +(cid:16) 1

H4 + ···i(2)

where the symbol Hn denotes the n-th polynomial of the

boson operators, E0 = −2N JS2 sin2 α is the classical
ground state energy of the Y-x state. Performing a uni-
tary transformation, then a Bogoliubov transformation
on H2, one can diagonize H2 as:

H2 = E2 + 2Xk

correction to the ground state energy at the LSW or-
2 cos 2β cos ky ±
2 cos2 α cos kx.
Obviously, ω±k = ω±
−k which is dictated by the symme-
tries of the Hamiltonian. Note that to the LSW order,
the dispersion still has the Mirror symmetry under the
β → π/2 − β. However the mirror symmetry will be
spoiled by the higher order terms starting at H3.
As shown in [19], at α = π/2, the Y-x state is the
exact ground state, χk = 0, there is no need for the
extra Bogoliubov transformation, the spin wave disper-
sion reduces to ω±k = λ±k . As shown in [24], any trans-
verse ﬁelds transfer the Y-x state into co-planar canted
states.
In sharp contrast, here, under π/2 − α 6= 0,
the Y-x state remains the classical state, but not the
exact eigenstate anymore and starts to suﬀer quantum
ﬂuctuations.
It is deviation from the line α 6= π/2
which introduces quantum ﬂuctuations. From ω−k , one
can identify the minimum (0, k0
y) of spin-wave disper-
sion. Setting λ = cos(2β)

be shown below, the gapless mode along the diagonal
line and the associated (zx = 1, zy = 2) quantum Lif-
shitz transition are just spurious facts of the LSW. The
mirror symmetry under β → π/2 − β is also a spurious
one.

be important to understand what is the true quantum
ground state along the diagonal line near the Abelian
point α = β = π/2. At the classical level, the 2 × 1 Y-
x stripy state Sy = (−1)x is degenerate with the 1 × 2
X-y stripy state Sx = (−1)y.
In fact, we ﬁnd there is
a family of states called 2 × 2 vortex states in Fig.2:
Si = ((−1)iy cos φ, (−1)ix sin φ, 0) which are degenerate
at the classical level. In general, this family breaks the
C4 × C4 symmetry except at φ = ±π/4,±3π/4. When
φ = 0, π/2,
it recovers to the X-y and Y-x state re-
spectively. Quantum ﬂuctuations ( ”order from disor-
der” mechanism ) are needed to ﬁnd the unique quantum
ground state upto the C4 × C4 symmetry in this regime.
To perform a LSW calculation, one need to introduce a
4 sublattice structure A, B, C, D shown in Fig.2. After
making suitable rotations to align the spin quantization
axis along the Z axis, we introduce 4 HP bosons a, b, c, d

state Sy = (−1)x is the exact quantum ground state [19]
at α = π/2. The 3 × 1 spiral state is close to be a FM
state in the rotated basis ˜Sn = R(ˆx, 2αn)Sn. All the red
arrows in 120◦ structure ( connected by the dashed line ) will
be transformed to a FM state in the rotated basis, the blue
arrows are actual spiral spin orientations which only deviate
slightly from the red arrows. The deviation angles still depend
on the location in the 3 × 1 staircase. The spiral states at
4 × 1, 5 × 1 and other devil’s staircases ( not shown ) can be
similarly constructed. The inset show the spin axis for the
collinear and spiral states. The degeneracy is 2N for odd N
and N for even N . There is also a small magnetization for N
odd and zero one for N even. Bottom layer: the classically

it picks the Y-x state with φ = π/2.
it
picks the X-y state with φ = 0. Setting α = β, the
E0 = −2N JS2(1 − cos 2α) becomes φ independent, indi-
cating the classical degenerate family of states character-
ized by the angle φ. Fortunately, the quantum correction

If α < β,

E2(φ) = Pk,n[ωn(k, φ) − sin2 α] does depend on φ. As
shown in Fig.3a, we ﬁnd that E2(φ) reach its minimum
at φ = 0 ( X-y state ) or φ = π/2 ( Y-x state) which is
related to each other by the C4 × C4 symmetry. Expand-
ing E2(φ) ( in unit of 2JS ) around one of its minima
2 B(α)φ2 +··· , one can identify the
φ = 0, E2(φ) = E0
coeﬃcient B(α) as plotted in the Fig.2b .

FIG. 3. The order from disorder and the gap opening on
the spurious gapless mode along the diagonal line in Fig.1.
(a) The quantum correction to the ground-state energy from
the LSW. φ = 0 corresponds to X-y state and φ = π/2 corre-
sponds to Y-x state. So the quantum ﬂuctuations pick up Y-x
or X-y as the ground state which is related to each other by
the C4 × C4 symmetry. (b) The classical coeﬃcient A(α)/J
and the quantum one B(α)/J. Both vanish at the Abelian
point α = β = π/2 as ∼ (π/2 − α)2 and are monotonically in-
creasing function when moving away from the Abelian point.
The Dashed line is located at α0
in ∼ 0.3661π where the Y-x
state becomes unstable at the LSW order. After incorpo-
rating the gap opening, the α0
in is shifted to a smaller value
αin ∼ 0.3526π.

direct ﬁrst order transition from the Y-x state to the X-y
state along the diagonal line in Fig.1. So along the diag-
onal line, there is any mixture of the Y-x and X-y state.
Similar ﬁrst order transition between vacancy induced
supersolid ( SS-v ) and interstitial induced supersolid (
SS-i ) and any mixtures of the two along the particle-hole
symmetric line were discussed in [30–32].

The spin wave gap generated by the order from
disorder mechanism. The gapless nature of the spin
wave spectrum Eqn.7 and the associated (zx = 1, zy = 2)
quantum Lifshitz transition in Fig.S1a are spurious facts
of the LSW. It will be gapped out by the higher order
terms in the 1/S expansion Eqn.2. The quantum Lif-
shitz transition survives, but with diﬀerent dynamic ex-
ponents. It turns out that the leading order corrections
to the gap at the minimum (π, 0) of the C-Cπ magnons
can be achieved by the spin coherent path integral for-
mulation [3, 33]. A general state can be taken as a FM
state with the polar angle (θ, φ) in the ˜˜SU (2) basis with
~˜˜Si = R(ˆx, πn1)R(ˆy, πn2)~Si at the α = β = π/2 Abelian
point. After transforming back to the original basis using
˜˜S1 = Rz(π)S1, ˜˜S2 = Ry(π)S2, ˜˜S3 = Rx(π)S3, ˜˜S4 = S4,
the state becomes a 2 × 2 vortex state characterized by
the two angles θ and φ. Along the diagonal line, its clas-
sical energy becomes

H0 = J[−2 sin2 α − 2 cos2 α sin2 θ]

(10)

which is, as expected, φ in-dependent. But one can see
any deviation from the Abelian point will pick up the
XY plane with θ = π/2. So it reduces to the 2 × 2
vortex state in Fig.2 used in the ” order from disorder
” analysis in the last section. Expanding around the

minimum H0 = J[−2 sin2 α + 2 cos2 α(θ− π
2 )2 +··· ] gives
the stiﬀness A = 2J cos2 α shown in Fig.3b. Using the
spin coherent state analysis, we can write down the spin
action:

where we put back the spin S, the ﬁrst term is the
spin Berry phase term, A and B are from the classical
analysis in Eqn.10 and the quantum analysis to LSW
order in Eqn.9 respectively. Eqn.11 leads to the gap
∆B = √SAB ∝ √S.
In fact, there are also correc-
tions from the cubic and quartic terms in Eqn.2, but
they only contribute to order of 1 which is subleading
to the √S order in the 1/S expansion [34]. As shown
in Fig.3b, because both A and B are monotonically in-
creasing along the diagonal line, so the gap also increase.
in = arccos(1/√6), When
Plugging their values at α = α0
taking A/J = 1/3, B/J ≈ 0.008 and S = 1/2, we ﬁnd
the maximum gap near the quantum Lifshitz transition
∆B/J ∼ 0.036.
3 × 3 non-coplanar Skyrmion Crystal phase
(SkX) and an in-commensurate SkX phase inter-
vening between the Y-x phase and the 3 × 3 SkX
phase. Near α = β = π/3, it is natural to take a 3 × 3
ansatz: S(ix,iy ) = S(ix+3m,iy +3n) with m, n ∈ Z. We
estimate its classical ground-state energy by minimizing
E3×3({φi, θi}0≤i≤9) over its 18 variables. Along the di-
agonal line (α = β), as long as α is not too small, the
minimization of E3×3 always leads to a C4 × C4 symmet-
ric 3 × 3 SkX state ( See SM) shown in Fig.2. This is in
sharp contrast to the case near α = β = π/2 where the
classical analysis only leads to the degenerate family of
2 × 2 vortex states shown in Fig.2. A quantum ” order
from disorder ” analysis is needed to show the 2 × 2 vor-
tex state phase separates into any mixtures of the Y-x
state and X-y state along the diagnose line.

Comparing the classical ground energy of the 3 × 3
SkX with that of the Y-x state EY −x = −2J sin2 α
leads to a putative ﬁrst order transition between the
two states at α33 ≈ 0.340188π which is smaller than
the putatively second order transition point α0
in =
arccos(1/√6) = 0.36614π between the Y-x state and the
In-commensurate phase at the LSW order. However,
as shown in the last section, there is a gap ∆ opening
along the diagonal line, so the quantum Lifshitz transi-
tion point will shift to a smaller value of α. Because the
spectrum along the qx is non-critical, so one can insert
the gap into the spectrum in Eqn.7 and put qx = 0:

ω−(qx = 0, qy) =q∆2

y)) with q0

Plugging in the values of ∆ and u, we ﬁnd qic ∼ 0.18π
( Fig.S1d ) and the shift is so small that αic ∼ 0.3526π
remains larger than α33 ∼ 0.3402π as shown in Fig.1.
So there must be an In-commensurate phase interven-
ing between the Y-x state and the 3 × 3 state when
α33 < α < αic in Fig.1. The transition from the Y-x
to IC state is a quantum Lifshitz transition with the dy-
namic exponent z = 1 ( Fig. S1d) instead of the one with
(zx = 1, zy = 2) at the LSW order in Fig.S1a. The IC
phase has the 4 orbital order wave-vectors (0,±(π − q0
y))
and (π,±(π − q0
y ≥ qic. The spin structure
of this IC phase remains to be determined.
It should
be a IC non-coplanar Skyrmion crystal phase which we
name as IC-SkX/Y-x phase. Similarly, starting form
the X-y phase, one can reach the IC-SkX/X-y phase
with the 4 orbital order wave-vectors (±(π − q0
x), 0) and
(±(π − q0
x), π). So along the diagonal line α33 < α < αic,
there must be co-existence of the two IC phase with any
ratios ( Fig.1 and its inset ). The Y-x state has the C-
Cπ magnons when α0
in < α < π/2, the C-IC magnons
at the two minima (0,±k0
y < π when
αin < α < α0
in as shown in Fig.S1c. So along the diago-
nal line αic < α < π/2, there must be co-existence of the
Y-x and X-y phases with any ratios ( Fig.1 ). In fact,
α33 also shifts to a smaller value due to the intervening
of the IC-SkX/Y-x phase, but for simplicity, we still use
the same symbol.

y) with π − qic < k0

Similarly we can determine the excitations spectra
above the 3 × 3 SkX. We expect the transition from the
IC-SKY/Y-x state to the 3 × 3 SkX is also a quantum
Lifshitz transition with z = 1. So a putative direct ﬁrst
order transition between the Y-x state and the 3× 3 SkX
splits into 2 second order quantum Lifshitz transitions
with z = 1 with the IC-SkX intervening between them.
The point α = α33 in Fig.1 is a bi-critical point.

Classical devil’s staircases at generic 0 < β <
α < π/2, pre-empty of the magnon condensation
transitions and the meta-stable Y-x phase. Now
we try to understand the global phase diagram Fig.1 from
the whole Abelian line at the bottom 0 < α < π/2, β = 0.
We will establish the classical phase diagram by mapping
its lower half β < α = π/N to the Frenkel-Kontorowa
(FK) model with N ×1 ansatz. We consider a N ×1 spin-
orbital structure commensurate with a lattice with N×M
lattice sites. We will reach the incommensurate limit by
taking N → ∞ limit. Within a general N × 1 ansatz,
applying the local spin rotation ˜Sn = R(ˆx, 2αn)Sn in
Eqn.1 to get rid of the R matrix along the x bonds, writ-
ing the spin as a classical unit vector in the rotated basis
˜Sn = (cos ˜ηn, sin ˜ξn sin ˜ηn, cos ˜ξn sin ˜ηn), we ﬁnd that any
β > 0 picks up ˜ηn = π/2 ( namely, a coplanar state in
˜Y ˜Z plane ) and the trial energy per site is Etri(N × 1) =
N PN
n=1[cos( ˜ξn− ˜ξn+1)− sin2 β cos(2 ˜ξn + 4αn)+ cos2 β]
− J
which can be transformed back to the original frame us-
ing ξn = ˜ξn + 2nα ( so the spins remain in a coplanar

state in the original Y Z plane shown in Fig.2 ).

One can see Etri(N × 1) maps to the 1d Frenkel-
Kontorova (FK) Model discussed in [50] at a ﬁnite size N
with the periodic boundary condition or 2d Pokrovsky-
Talapov (PT) which was used to discuss C-IC transition
in 2d Bilayer quantum Hall systems [52].

Some insights can be achieved from the FK model at
a small β. The kinetic term favors ξn+1 = ξn + 2α, while
the potential term favors ξn = ±π/2. When α = π/2,
this leads to the Y-x state as the exact ground state.
However, when α = π/N, N = 3, 4, 5,··· , frustrations
comes in. At a small β, the kinetic term dominates over
the potential term, so ξn+1 ∼ ξn + 2α still holds approx-
imately as shown for the 3 × 1, 4 × 1, 5 × 1 spiral state
in Fig.2. There are qualitative even-odd diﬀerences: The
net magnetization in the N × 1 unit cell is small, but
non-vanishing for odd N , exactly vanishes for even N .
Odd N always contain ξ0 = ±π/2, but even N do not.
Even N always has a larger stable regime than its previ-
ous odd N − 1. There is a always cyclic degeneracy N for
both even and odd N . The T gives a diﬀerent state for N
odd, but not for even N . so the degeneracy is 2N for odd
N , just N for even N . One can check other symmetries
operations Px,Py,Pz do not generate new states.
For any parameter β < α = π/N , Eq.(13) gives
the best estimation of the ground-state energy as
EN×1 which can be compared to that of the Y-x
min
N∈[1,∞)
state EY −x = −2J sin2 α. If we ﬁnd min EN×1 < EY −x
for some N , then it means Y-x becomes unstable against
some IC phase. Note that even min EN×1 may not give
real ground-state energy, but it does give a upper bound
for the ground-state energy of the IC phase whose precise
nature is diﬃcult to determine using the N×1 ansatz in a
ﬁnite size calculation. The ﬁrst order transition line from
the Y-x to some IC phases is drawn in Fig.1. It matches
very precisely the line achieved from the previous works
[21, 22] using classical Monte-Carlo simulations. It hits
the ±2π/3 contour line inside the Y-x phase at one corner
of the 3×3 SkX phase which is a multi-critical ( M ) point
at (αM , βM ) ≈ (0.33952π, 0.31284π) of several commen-
surate and In-commensurate phases in Fig.1. So all the
C-C0 regime and the C-IC regime with 0 < k0
y < 2π/3 in
the Y-x phase are pre-emptied by some in-commensurate
phases through the ﬁrst-order transition line. So the Y-
x state becomes only a meta-stable state ( just a local
minimum in energy landscapes ) between the ﬁrst-order
transition line and the putative 2nd-order condensation
boundary of the C-C0 and the C-IC magnons found by
the LSW. There is no mirror symmetry anymore beyond
the LSW. For example, the C-Cπ regime at α = β sus-

7

tains gap opening process due to the order from disorder
phenomena. However, its mirror image which is the C-
C0 regime at α = π/2 − β in Eqn.6 sustains no such
phenomena. Of course, the condensation boundary at
0 < β < βM ∼ 0.31284π suﬀers a small shift due to
the higher order terms in Eqn.2. But it is completely
pre-emptied by the ﬁrst order transition anyway.

We also extend our calculations near α = π/2 to
near α = π/3, π/4, π/5,··· to determine the classical
boundaries between these robust commensurate phases
with some in-commensurate phases achieved from the FK
model. In contrast to the Y-x state near α = π/2, these
commensurate phases near α = π/3, π/4, π/5,··· are co-
planar spiral phases shown in Fig.2 instead of a collinear
phase. We ﬁnd even at the classical level, there is a ﬁrst
order transition from the 4 × 1 state to the 1 × 4 state
along the diagonal line. While one need resorts ” order
from quantum disorder” mechanism to select out Y-x and
X-y state as the quantum ground state near α = π/2.
This may be due to the fact that only near α = π/2, the
state is in collinear states, while all the other commensu-
rate states near α = π/N, N > 2 are non-collinear spiral
phases. It turns out the 3 × 3 SkX is the only commen-
surate non-coplanar state along the diagonal line ( see
SM). All the other phases separate into N × 1 and 1× N
co-planar spiral phase. It may be interesting to perform
LSW calculations on some of these spiral phases to see
if the second order phase transitions due to the conden-
sations of these magnons are always pre-emptied by the
ﬁrst-order phase transitions.

Taking N → ∞ limit, one may approach the α = β = 0
Abelian point. It suggests some IC phase near the point.
To test this prediction, we ﬁrst identify a U (1) family of
degenerate classical state which is a FM state within XY
plane. Then by performing a LSW on this degenerate
manifold, the linear term indeed vanishes indicating it
is at least a meta-stable phase, we ﬁnd the spin wave
spectrum always become negative. This fact indicates
the true ground state should be some in-commensurate
phases corresponding to N → ∞ limit in the FK model.
Implications on cold atom experiments and ma-
terials with SOC . Following [19], one can work out the
thermodynamic quantities such as magnetization, uni-
form and staggered susceptibilities, speciﬁc heat at the
low temperatures in all the phases in Fig.1. Similarly,
one can work out various kinds of spin correlation func-
tions at the low and high temperatures. In contrast to
[19],[23], there is no more spin-orbital coupled U (1) sym-
metry away from the line (α = π/2, β), so one need to
calculate the 3 × 3 tensor hSi(~k, ω)Sj(−~k,−ω)i. In the
cold atom contexts, all these physical quantities can be
detected by atom or light Bragg spectroscopies [37, 38],
speciﬁc heat measurements [39, 40] and the In-Situ mea-
surements [41]. In materials, they can be easily measured
by magnetic resonant X-ray diﬀraction or neutron scat-
tering techniques [45–47].

Most recently, using the optical Raman lattice scheme,
the authors in the experiment [17] realized the 2d SOC
with tunable (α, β) in a square lattice. However, so
far, the experiments are still in very weakly interacting
regime where the systems are in various spin-orbital cor-
related superﬂuid states. As estimated in Sec.VII, the
strong coupling regime can be easily realized in a rela-
tively deep optical lattice. It seems the possible heating
issues in such a strong coupling regime are well under
control. So the novel phases and phase transitions in
Fig.1 are ready to be explored in the experiment setup
in [17] and also in [16] using the atomic clock scheme.

Various IC-SkX phase have already been observed
in some materials with a strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) interaction [42, 43].
Indeed, a 2D skyrmion lat-
tice has been observed between hc1 = 50 mT and
hc2 = 70 mT in some chiral magnets MnSi or a thin
ﬁlm of Fe0.5Co0.5Si [44]. An IC-SkX phase was also de-
tected on iridates [45–47] α, β, γ-Li2IrO3. As shown in
[19], the RFHM can be expanded as Heisenberg- fer-
romagnetic Kitaev-DM form. One can estimate their
separate values near α = α0
in in the IC-SkX in the in-
set of Fig.1:
H =
cos 2α = −2/3, so it is an AFM coupling. the Kitaev

D = 2 sin 2α = √5/3. So the model becomes a

dominant FM Kitaev term plus a small AFM Heisenberg
term and a small DM term. So the RFHM could be an al-
ternative minimal model to the Heisenberg-Kitaev-Ising
(J, K, I) model used in [46, 47] or Heisenberg-Kitaev-
Exchange (J, K, Γ) model used in [48, 49] to ﬁt the ex-
perimental data phenomenologically. One common thing
among all the three models is a dominant FM Kitaev
term plus a small AFM Heisenberg term.

y) and (π, k0

As shown in [23], when a longitudinal ﬁeld hy is ap-
plied on the RFHM along the dashed line (α = π/2, β) in
Fig.1, any hy immediately drags out the C-IC magnons
and drives its condensation to an IN-SkX phase with only
two orbital ordering wavevectors (0, k0
y) whose
spin structure can also be determined. However, the
IC-SkX phase in Fig.1 has 4 orbital order wave-vectors
(0,±(π − k0
y)) whose spin structures
are more complicated and will be determined in future
publications. As shown in [24], when a transverse ﬁeld
hx or hz is applied on the RFHM along the dashed line
(α = π/2, β) in Fig.1, only the C − C0 magnons emerge
and drives a transition to a X-FM or Z-FM phase. No
chances to reach any IC-SkX phase. Of course, as shown

in the SM, it is quite possible the ﬁrst order transition
line between the 3 × 3 and the 4 × 1 ( or 1 × 4 ) is also
split into two second order ones with a tiny IC-SkX phase
intervening. The nature of all the IC phases sandwiched
between all the robust commensurate phases in Fig.1 are
still not clear. The IC phase, when expanded, may also
show small staircases at higher rational numbers. Sev-
eral important concepts such as Cantor set and fractal
dimensions can be employed here to understand possi-
ble hierarchy fractal structures in these IC phases. FK
model may be a typical model to study classical C-IC
transition in 1d systems. RFHM may be a typical model
to study quantum C-IC transitions in any dimensions.

One of the original goals to study the eﬀects of SOC in
quantum spin systems [9, 11] is to look for quantum spin
liquid phases which may have a good chance to be sand-
wiched by two commensurate phases. Unfortunately, in
the whole phase diagram in Fig.1, any transitions be-
tween two commensurate phases are either a direct ﬁrst
order or splits into 2 second order one with an intermedi-
ate IC-SKX phase. However, the chances to ﬁnd possible
spin liquids still hold in a honeycomb lattice with the
three SOC parameters (α, β, γ). It is worth to point out
that in the so called Kitaev materials such A2IrO3 with
A = N a2, Li2 or α−RuCl3, so far, only Zig-Zag phase or
IC-SkX phase were observed experimentally [45–47], no
spin liquids have been found. It has been demonstrated
the dominant Kitaev term is extremely fragile against
various kinds of small perturbations [11].
It is the au-
thors opinions that it is extremely unlikely to observe the
Kitaev spin liquid in these so called Kitaev materials. In
view of recent ground breaking experiments generating
2d SOC which can tune various SOC parameters, lattice
geometries and weak to strong interactions [14–17], there
may be some promising platforms to quantum simulate
spin liquid phase in cold atom systems.

Although classical RFHM and RAFHM makes no dif-
ferences [21, 22], the quantum RFHM and RAFHM are
dramatically diﬀerent.
Indeed, as shown in the recent
work [51], the RAFHM along the line (α = π/2, β) show
dramatically diﬀerent phenomena than those in RFHM
in Fig.1. So we expect the RAFHM in the generic case
will also be dramatically diﬀerent and will be investigated
in a future publication.

The quantum Lifshitz transition from the Y-x state to the IC-SkX/Y-x state

In the main text, by the spin-coherent state path integral, we obtained the gap opening in the Y-x state along the

diagonal ˜∆B = J√SAB = 4JSpAB/(16S) = 4JS∆B. Note that in Eqn.M3, the unit of spin wave dispersion at the
LSW order is in the unit of 4JS. Obviously, the magnons always take the relativistic form Eqn.14 to any order of
spin wave expansion, so it is justiﬁed to incorporate the gap ∆B into the spin-wave dispersion ωk at the LSW order.
It leads to Ωk = p∆2
k whose evolution is shown in Fig.4. Plugging in the value of the gap ∆B ∼ 0.036, we
estimate the new quantum critical point is shifted to α = αin = 0.3526π with the onset orbital order qic ∼ 0.18π as
shown in Fig.4d. This is a quantum Lifshitz C-IC transition from the Y-x state to the IC-SkX/Y-x with the dynamic
exponent z = 1.

Classical devil’s staircases at α = π/N, N = 2, 3, 4, 5, · · · .

The classical ground state energies of the α = π/N devil staircases from the FK model are shown in Fig.5. In
fact, every staircase at α = π/N in Fig.5 contains N pieces: α = π
N n, n = 0, 1, 2,··· , N − 1. However, because α
and α′ = π − α ( its image about π/2 ) has the same set of Wilson loops, so they belong to the same equivalent
class and have the same ground state energy. In fact, as shown in Fig.M2, in the N × 1 spiral state at α = π/N ,
ξn+1 ∼ ξn + n(2α) which is a clockwise rotation. So at its image α′ = π − π/N , ξn+1 ∼ ξn − n(2α) which is a

FIG. 5. Classical Energy competition from diﬀerent staircases along the diagonal line α = β. The only collinear state is the
2 × 1 Y-x state. The only non-coplanar state is the 3 × 3 skyrmion crystal state which has lower energy than the 3 × 1 coplanar
state. All the other N × 1, N ≥ 4 states are co-planar states. The N × 1 ansatz means the optimized energy from the N × 1

counter-clockwise rotation. So one can just conﬁne α ≤ π/2, so every staircase in Fig.5 has [N/2] pieces where [...]
means the closest integer which is equal or larger than N/2. Because all the N contain n = 0 which is a FM along
the Y direction, all the α = π/N contains the FM piece near α = 0. As N → ∞, there are always in-commensurate
phases below the FM phase. In fact, as shown in the main text, there is a degenerate family of FM state in the XY
plane along the diagonal line near α = 0. In the spin wave expansion, although the linear term vanishes, the spin
wave spectrum becomes negative indicating its instability against some IC phases.

In fact, there could always be a small regime of IC phases sandwiched between two Commensurate phases along
the diagonal line. For example, when following the 7 × 1 ansatz in Fig.2, we ﬁnd there is a tiny regime between 4 × 1
and the 3 × 3 SkX, π/4 < α = 2π/7 < π/3 state has the lower energy than both, which indicating there could a tiny
regime of an IC phase intervening between the 4 × 1 and the 3 × 3 SkX ( not shown in Fig.5 and Fig.M1 ).

The 3 × 3 SkX and its ordering wavevectors

We determine the spin conﬁgurations of the 3 × 3 SkX along the diagonal line in both real space and momentum

space. It is the only state respecting the C4 × C4 symmetry.

1. The structure in real space
The 3 × 3 SkX along the diagonal line shown in Fig.5 respects the C4 × C4 symmetry. The spin in the center
is along z axis. Due to the C4 × C4 symmetry, there are only two pairs of independent angles (η1, ξ1) and (η2, ξ2)
characterizing the group (S1, S3, S7, S9) and (S2, S4, S6, S8) respectively:

S5 = (0, 0, 1),
S1 = (− cos ξ1 sin η1,− sin ξ1 sin η1, cos η1), S3 = (− sin ξ1 sin η1, cos ξ1 sin η1, cos η1),
S7 = (sin ξ1 sin η1,− cos ξ1 sin η1, cos η1), S9 = (cos ξ1 sin η1, sin ξ1 sin η1, cos η1),
S2 = (− cos ξ2 sin η2,− sin ξ2 sin η2, cos η2), S4 = (− sin ξ2 sin η2, cos ξ2 sin η2, cos η2),
S6 = (sin ξ2 sin η2,− cos ξ2 sin η2, cos η2), S8 = (cos ξ2 sin η2, sin ξ2 sin η2, cos η2),

(18)

For α = β = π/3, the ground state energy per site is EGS = −1.53608J0 and the two pairs of angles are (η1, ξ1) =

(0.59π, π/4) and (η2, ξ2) = (0.49π, 0) leading to the total spin:

Stot =Xi

Si = (0, 0, 0.004088)

12

(19)

which has exact vanishing Sx, Sy components, but still a small non-vanishing Sz component justifying the name SkX.

2. The structure in momentum space

For general 3 × 3 SkX, we can always expand it in terms of its 9 ordering wavevectors 2π

3 (m, n)

Sα(x, y) = Xm,n=0,1,2

mneiφmn ei 2π
ρα

3 (mx+ny)

(20)

where α = X, Y, Z are the spin’s three components. Here, we take the Z component as an illustration.

To make the expression simple, we just set the spin at the center has Sz = 1 and all other spins in Fig.5b are in
the XY plane, so having no Sz components: Sz(2, 2) = 1, Sz(i, j) = 0, for i 6= 2 or j 6= 2 which is more like a meron.

The components in Eqn.20 are:

ρm,n = 1/9, φ =


which leads to a very simple expression:

φ11 φ12 φ13
φ21 φ22 φ23
φ31 φ32 φ33

Sz(x, y) =

9 Xm,n=0,1,2

ei 2π

3 [m(x+1)+n(y+1)]

(21)

(22)

The real spin conﬁguration in Eqn.18 can be similarly computed, but with a more complicated expression. The Sx
and Sy components are be similarly constructed. Note that the 2 × 2 vortex state in Fig. M2 has only two ordering
wavevectors (0, π) and (π, 0), the other two (0, 0) and (π, π) are excluded due to the fact the 2 × 2 vortex state is a
co-planar state instead of a non-coplanar one.
In the Fig.M1, there is a second order transition from the Y-x state to the 3 × 3 SkX state at the M point
through the contour (0,±2π/3). The transition indicates the orbital orderings (π, 0) + (0,±2π/3) = (π,±2π/3) or
(π, 0) + (π,±2π/3) = (0,±2π/3). The former does not belong to the 9 ordering wavevectors of the 3 × 3 SkX state.
But the latter do. Similarly, approaching from the X-y state leads to (±2π/3, 0) ordering wavevectors.
