Recent phenomenological analysis of experimental data on DIS processes induced by charged
leptons and neutrinos/antineutrinos beams on nuclear targets by CTEQ collaboration has conﬁrmed
the observation of CCFR and NuTeV collaborations, that weak structure function F W eak
(x, Q2) is
2A (x, Q2) in a nucleus like iron, specially in the
diﬀerent from electromagnetic structure function F EM
region of low x and Q2. In view of this observation we have made a study of nuclear medium eﬀects
on F W eak
2A (x, Q2) for a wide range of x and Q2 using a microscopic nuclear model.
We have considered Fermi motion, binding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic contributions from
pion and rho mesons and shadowing eﬀects to incorporate nuclear medium eﬀects. The calculations
are performed in a local density approximation using a relativistic nucleon spectral function which
includes nucleon correlations. The numerical results in the case of iron nucleus are compared with
the experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

The Deep Inelastic Scattering(DIS) processes induced by charged leptons and neutrinos/antineutrinos on nucleons
and nuclear targets are important tools to study the quark parton structure of free nucleons and the nucleons when
they are bound in a nucleus. The ﬁrst observation of EMC eﬀect in the DIS of muon [1] from iron target and using
electron beam with various nuclear targets at SLAC [2], discovered that the quark parton distribution of free nucle-
ons are considerably modiﬁed when they are bound in a nucleus. Subsequent DIS experiments performed on many
nuclear targets with charged leptons [3–12] and neutrinos/antineutrinos [13–23] have conﬁrmed the initial results of
EMC eﬀect. These experiments make measurements of DIS cross sections which are theoretically expressed in terms
of nucleon structure functions. The structure functions are determined by making Rosenbluth like separations of
the measured cross section. The electromagnetic DIS cross section induced by charged leptons are given in terms of
two structure functions F EM
(x, Q2) (i=1,2), while the weak DIS cross section induced by neutrinos/antineutrinos
are given in terms of three structure functions F W eak
(x, Q2) (i=1,2,3), Q2 and ν being the four momentum transfer
square and the energy transfer(ν = El − E ′
l), to the target [24]. In the kinematic region of Bjorken scaling of large
ν and Q2, the structure functions F1(x, Q2) and F2(x, Q2) are related by the Callan-Gross relation [25]. Therefore,
in this kinematic region, the electromagnetic DIS cross sections are expressed in terms of only one structure function
chosen to be F EM
(x, Q2)
and F W eak
(x, Q2). The DIS experiments induced by charged leptons have been done using nuclear targets in the
entire region of mass number from light nuclei to heavy nuclei, while the weak DIS experiments induced by neutri-
nos/antineutrinos have been done mainly on medium and heavy nuclei [18–23]. Therefore, it is very important to study
the nuclear medium eﬀects in the cross section and the structure functions determined from these DIS experiments
in order to understand the structure functions of free nucleons and their modiﬁcations in nuclear medium.

Considerable theoretical and experimental eﬀorts have been devoted to understand the nuclear medium eﬀects on
the structure function F2A(x, Q2) in electromagnetic and weak interactions as they play dominant role in determining
the cross sections. A precise knowledge of nuclear medium eﬀects in F EM,W eak
(x, Q2) can give information about the
higher twist eﬀects in the quark-parton distributions of both valence quarks and sea quarks in the free nucleon as well
(x, Q2) which is sensitive only to the valence quarks.
as their modiﬁcations in the nuclear medium in contrast to F W eak
Consequently a comparative study of F EM,W eak
(x, Q2) and F W eak
(x, Q2) gives very useful information about the
properties of sea quarks and their modiﬁcations in nuclear medium.

JLab is using high luminosity electron beams to make cross section measurements with several nuclear targets,
which have resulted in obtaining wealth of new information on the structure functions F EM
2A (x, Q2)
with good precision [10]. Furthermore, the future plan is to perform these measurements using high energy electron
beam of 12 GeV in wide range of x and Q2. In the weak sector, several experiments are going on to study neutrino

oscillation physics and some of them like MINERvA [15, 16] and DUNE [26] are specially designed to precisely measure
neutrino and antineutrino cross sections in the DIS region on some nuclear targets like carbon, oxygen, argon, iron
and lead. The presently available data on electromagnetic nuclear structure functions from various experiments [3–12]
have been phenomenologically analyzed to determine the nuclear medium eﬀects.

In the phenomenological analyses there are few approaches for determining nuclear Parton Distribution Func-
tions(PDFs). The general approach is that nuclear PDFs are obtained using the charged lepton-nucleus scattering
data and analyzing the ratio of the structure functions e.g. F2A
, where A, A′ represent any two nuclei and D
stands for the deuteron, to determine nuclear correction factor. The nuclear correction factor is then multiplied with
free nucleon PDFs to get nuclear PDFs. While determining the nuclear correction factor, the information regard-

F2A′ , F2A

ing nuclear modiﬁcation is also obtained from the Drell-Yan cross section ratio like

σDY

,

σDY

σDY
pA′

, where p stands for

proton beam. Furthermore, the information about the nuclear correction factor is also supplemented by high energy
reaction data from the experiments at LHC, RHIC, etc. This approach has been used by Hirai et al. [27], Eskola et
al. [28], Bodek and Yang [29], de Florian and Sassot [30]. The same nuclear correction factor is taken for the weak
DIS processes. In a recent analysis de Florian et al. [30] have also included ν-A DIS data along with the charged
lepton-nucleus scattering data and Drell-Yan data. Their [30] conclusion is that the same nuclear correction factor
can describe the nuclear medium eﬀect in l±-A and ν-A DIS processes.

In the other approach nuclear PDFs are directly obtained by analyzing the experimental data i.e without using
nucleon PDFs or nuclear correction factor [31]. This approach has been recently used by nCTEQ [32, 33] group in
getting F EM
(x, Q2) by analyzing together the charged lepton-A DIS data and DY
p-A data sets, and separately analyzing ν(¯ν) − A DIS data sets. Their observation is that the nuclear medium eﬀects
on F EM
(x, Q2) in weak interaction in the region of
low x. Thus in this region there is a disagreement between the observation of these two studies [30, 32]. The results of
CTEQ collaboration agree with the observation of CCFR and NuTeV collaborations which had concluded that nuclear
medium eﬀects in F W eak
2A (x, Q2), in the region of x < 0.3. This is the region in which
nuclear medium eﬀects as well as higher twist eﬀect even at the nucleon level may be important. The nuclear medium
eﬀects due to modiﬁcations of sea quark distributions, nuclear shadowing and mesonic contributions are important in
this region.

Theoretically, there have been very few calculations of studying nuclear medium eﬀects in the structure functions
but no serious attempt has been made to make a comparison of F EM
(x, Q2) structure functions
[17, 34–38], therefore, it is highly desirable to make a detailed study of nuclear medium eﬀects on structure functions
in this region. It has been pointed out that these nuclear structure functions are diﬀerent in the region of low x due
to nuclear shadowing eﬀect being diﬀerent in electromagnetic and weak processes. It is expected that the nuclear
shadowing which is caused by the coherent scattering of hadrons produced in the hadronization process of mediating
vector bosons will be diﬀerent in the case of electromagnetic and weak processes. This is because the electromagnetic
and weak interactions take place through the interaction of photons and W ±/Z bosons, respectively, with the target
hadrons and the hadronization processes of photons and W ±/Z bosons are diﬀerent. Moreover, in the case of weak
interaction, the additional contribution of axial current which is not present in the case of electromagnetic interaction
may inﬂuence the behavior of F W eak
(x, Q2) specially if pions also play a role in the hadronization process through
PCAC. Furthermore, in this region of low x, sea quarks and mesons also play important role which could be diﬀerent
in the case of electromagnetic and weak processes. For example, the sea quark contribution, though very small is
not same for F EM
(x, Q2) even at the free nucleon level and could evolve diﬀerently in a nuclear
medium. A comparative study of mesonic contributions in the case of electromagnetic and weak structure functions
should also be made in view of some recent work done for the DIS cross sections [29, 39, 40].

Therefore, a microscopic understanding of the diﬀerence between F EM

(x, Q2) will be very
instructive for studying the nuclear medium eﬀects in DIS processes as emphasized recently at NuInt15 [41] workshop.
In this paper, we have studied nuclear medium eﬀects in the structure functions using a microscopic approach based
on ﬁeld theoretical formalism [42]. A relativistic nucleon spectral function has been used to describe the energy and
momentum distribution of the nucleons in nuclei [43]. This is obtained by using the Lehmann’s representation for
the relativistic nucleon propagator and nuclear many body theory is used to calculate it for an interacting Fermi sea
in nuclear matter. A local density approximation is then applied to translate these results to ﬁnite nuclei. Moreover,
the contributions of the pion and rho meson clouds are also taken into account in a many body ﬁeld theoretical
approach. This model has been earlier used by us to explain the nuclear medium eﬀects in electromagnetic as well
as weak interaction induced processes in the DIS region [39, 40, 44–47]. The present calculations are performed in
a wide range of x and Q2 without using Callan-Gross relation between nuclear structure functions F1A(x, Q2) and
F2A(x, Q2). In Sect. II some basic formalism for the inclusive charged lepton- and neutrino-nucleon/nucleus scattering
has been introduced. In Sect. III the numerical results are presented and discussed for F EM
(x, Q2).
In Sect. IV, we conclude our ﬁndings.

In the limit Q2 → ∞, ν → ∞, x ﬁnite, the structure functions FiN (x, Q2)(i = 1, 2) depend only on the variable x and
satisfy the Callan-Gross relation [25] given by 2xF1N (x) = F2N (x).

The general expression of structure function F2N (x) for electromagnetic interaction is given by,

where x is the fraction of parent’s hadron momentum carried by a quark, fi(x) is the density distribution of quarks,
index i runs over ﬂavors of quarks and ei is the charge of the corresponding quark. If we write the electromagnetic

In the neutrinos/antineutrinos nucleon deep inelastic scattering process, neutrino interacts with a nucleon(N ),

producing a lepton(l) and jet of hadrons(X) in the ﬁnal state:

νl/¯νl(k) + N (p) → l−/l+(k′) + X(p′), l = e, µ

(6)

In the above expression k and k′ are the four momenta of incoming neutrinos/antineutrinos and outgoing lepton
respectively; p is the four momentum of the target nucleon and p′ is the four momentum of hadronic state system X.
This process is mediated by the exchange of virtual boson W ± having four momentum q.

In the following, we describe in brief the various nuclear medium eﬀects, Fermi motion, binding, nucleon correlation,

isoscalarity correction and meson cloud contribution in obtaining the nuclear structure functions.

The relativistic nucleon propagator G(p) in a nuclear medium is obtained by starting with the relativistic free
nucleon Dirac propagator G0(p0, p) which is written in terms of the contribution from the positive and negative
energy components of the nucleon described by the Dirac spinors u(p) and v(p) [42, 43]. Only the positive energy
contributions are retained as the negative energy contributions are suppressed.
In the interacting Fermi sea, the
relativistic nucleon propagator is then written using Dyson series expansion in terms of nucleon self energy ΣN (p0, p)
which is shown in Fig.2. This perturbative expansion is summed in a ladder approximation as

Isoscalarity correction

In many DIS experiments heavier nuclear targets are used where the neutron number (N) exceeds the proton
number (Z), and the density of protons and neutrons are diﬀerent. Historically, the isoscalarity correction in the case
of electromagnetic processes induced by charged leptons are applied by multiplying the experimental results for the
cross section by a factor RA,EM

ISO , given by [12]

RA,EM

ISO =

2 + F ln

2 + (A − Z)F ln

[ZF lp

,

(25)

where F lp

2 and F ln

2 are the electromagnetic structure functions for proton and neutron, respectively.

The resulting cross section per nucleon in the nuclear targets is then compared with the cross section for the isoscalar
nucleon target which is obtained from the deuteron data after applying deuteron corrections. This comparative study
is used to determine the nuclear medium eﬀects. Phenomenologically the nuclear medium eﬀect, thus obtained is
parameterized by a function f (x) (independent of Q2), given by [22, 51]:

f (x) =

2A (x, Q2)

(26)

for isoscalar iron nuclear target and is used for many other nuclei in the medium mass range [12].

2A (x, Q2) is structure function for an isoscalar nuclear target.

This function f (x) is also used to take into account nuclear medium eﬀects for DIS by neutrinos/antineutrinos in

nuclear targets, after applying the following isoscalarity correction in the case of weak interaction processes

3. Mesonic eﬀect

We have also taken into account virtual meson contribution in nuclear medium. This arises due to the presence
of strong attractive nature of nucleon-nucleon interactions, which in turn leads to an increase in the interaction
probability of virtual boson with the meson clouds. To take into account mesonic eﬀect, we have used microscopic
approach by making use of the imaginary part of the meson propagators instead of spectral function, and obtain

For the shadowing eﬀect, we are following the prescription of Kulagin and Petti [37] who have used Glauber-Gribov
multiple scattering theory. By using the above expression(Eq. 33) for weak and electromagnetic nuclear structure
functions we have performed the calculations in carbon, aluminum, calcium, iron, copper, tin and lead nuclei and the
results are presented for diﬀerent kinematic regions of x and Q2.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have considered Fermi motion, binding energy, nucleon correlations using spectral function to evaluate the
structure functions, given in Eqs. 24 and 29 for isoscalar and nonisoscalar nuclear targets, respectively. The mesonic
contributions from pion and rho mesons are calculated using Eq. 30 and Eq. 33 respectively, while shadowing eﬀects
are included using the work of Kulagin and Petti [37]. PDFs parameterized by CTEQ group [48] have been used for
numerical calculations and the evaluations are made at the Next-to-Leading-Order(NLO). This is our full model.

To compare the present results for the structure functions F W eak

2A (x, Q2) with the results of CTEQ
collaboration [55], we have used their CJ12min PDFs set [56]. The calculations are performed for ﬁxed values of
strong coupling constant (αs(MZ) = 0.118 the approximate world average value) and the results are presented along
with the present results obtained using the microscopic model.

In Fig. 3, we present the results for F EM

In this ﬁgure, we show the curves for F EM,W eak

(x, Q2) vs x at diﬀerent values of Q2 viz. 2, 20,
50 GeV 2.
(x, Q2) obtained using the spectral function only, also
including the mesonic contribution, and ﬁnally using the full model which also includes shadowing. The use of nuclear
spectral function which takes into account Fermi motion, binding energy and nucleon correlations, leads to a reduction
of ∼ 8% at x = 0.1; ∼ 18% at x = 0.4; ∼ 3% at x = 0.7 in F EM
(x, Q2) nuclear structure
functions as compared to the free nucleon case. The inclusion of mesonic contributions from pion and rho mesons
leads to an enhancement in these structure functions at low and medium values of x. For example, the enhancement
is ∼ 30% at x=0.1; ∼ 15% at x=0.4; ∼ 0.3% at x=0.7. The inclusion of shadowing eﬀects further reduces these

structure functions and are eﬀective in low region of x ( < 0.1). For example, the reduction is ∼ 10% at x=0.05 and
∼ 5% at x=0.1. Thus, we ﬁnd that the mesonic contributions are sizable in the low and medium values of x, while
the shadowing eﬀects are non-negligible only in the low region of x. Therefore, when mesonic and shadowing eﬀects
are taken along with the nuclear medium eﬀects obtained by using the spectral function there is an overall change in
the numerical results from the free nucleon values which lead to better explanation of experimental data.

Here we have also shown the results obtained by using the prescription adopted by CCFR group [51], where nuclear
correction factor f (x) is obtained by analyzing charged lepton scattering data on isoscalar nuclear targets. In these
analyses nonisoscalar nuclear targets have also been considered after making isoscalarity correction. The nuclear
structure functions are then expressed as a product of free nucleon structure functions and nuclear correction factor
i.e.

In Figs. 4 and 5, we present the results for nuclear structure functions F EM,W eak

(x, Q2) for electromagnetic and
weak interactions in iron nucleus in the Q2 region 1.5 < Q2 < 10 GeV 2 and 15 < Q2 < 55 GeV 2 respectively,
using the full model at NLO. These results are compared with the available experimental data from the experiments
performed with charged lepton beams at JLab [10], EMC [4], SLAC [5–7, 11] and neutrinos/antineutrinos data from
CDHSW [13], CCFR [14], NuTeV [22] measurements. The theoretical results of structure functions shown in various
panels of Figs. 4 and 5 correspond to the central values of the range of Q2 in these ﬁgures. We see that the present
results are consistent with CCFR [14], JLab [10], NuTeV [22] data at medium and high values of Q2 but not in good
agreement at low Q2 with the experiments like CDHSW [13] and EMC [4]. From these ﬁgures, one may also observe
that at low x, EM structure function is slightly lower than the weak structure function which is about ∼ 4% in iron
at x = 0.1, and the diﬀerence decreases with the increase in x and almost becomes negligible for x > 0.3. We ﬁnd
that(not shown here) with the increase in mass number this diﬀerence increases. For example, in lead it becomes
∼ 7% while for low mass nuclei like carbon this diﬀerence becomes ∼ 1 − 2% at x = 0.1. Here we also compare our
results with the results obtained by CTEQ collaboration [48] using CJ12min PDFs [56].

In Fig. 6, we show the ratio R′ =

in various nuclei like 12C, 27Al, 40Ca, 56F e, 63Cu, 118Sn and 208P b
at Q2 = 6, 20, 50 GeV 2. These results are obtained assuming the targets to be nonisoscalar wherever applicable.
One may observe that for heavier nuclear targets like 118Sn and 208P b, the nonisoscalarity eﬀect is larger. This shows

the phenomenological prescription of RA,EM
given in Eqs.25 and 27 for electromagnetic and weak pro-
cesses, respectively. In the present model for the electromagnetic case, the deviation from isoscalarity is less than 1%
at smaller values of x, which increases to around 2 − 3% at higher values of x. The present results are also compared
with the results obtained by using phenomenological prescription given in Eqs.25 and 27. We ﬁnd that the diﬀerence
between the phenomenological approach and the present approach is less than a percent for all values of x.

While in the weak interaction case, we ﬁnd a larger diﬀerence in the results obtained by using phenomenological

for isoscalar nucleon. However, in the presence of non-zero PDFs for charm and strange quarks, this ratio R′

in the region of low x. This diﬀerence is about 2% for the isoscalar nucleon and increases to 6% in the case of 56F e
when the full model is used at NLO. This increase in R′ due to nuclear medium and nonisoscalarity eﬀect is almost
constant with the increase in Q2.

IV. CONCLUSION

2

(x, Q2) may be diﬀerent from F W eak

Recent results of a phenomenological analysis of nuclear structure functions by the CTEQ collaboration [41] sug-
(x, Q2) in iron nucleus specially at low x, have been examined in
gesting that F EM
a microscopic model by studying the nuclear medium eﬀects. The model makes use of local density approximation to
study the eﬀect of Fermi motion, nuclear binding and nucleon correlation eﬀects using a relativistic spectral function
and also includes the contribution of pion and rho mesons. The shadowing eﬀect has been included following the
work of Kulagin and Petti [37]. The results have been compared with the experimental data. It is concluded from
the study that:

2

• The structure functions F EM

2A (x, Q2) and F W eak

(x, Q2) in iron nucleus are almost same for large x i.e x > 0.3,
but are diﬀerent in small x region(x < 0.3). This diﬀerence is found to be very small for isoscalar nuclei, and is
similar to the case of free nucleon, where it is expected to exist due to the presence of heavy ﬂavor quark-parton
(x, Q2) structure functions. Quantitatively
distribution functions, which are diﬀerent in F EM
similar results are obtained even in the presence of mesonic and shadowing eﬀects.

• In the region of low x(x < 0.3), the diﬀerences in F EM

(x, Q2) and F W eak

(x, Q2) structure functions are mainly

due to nonisoscalarity of nuclei which is about ∼ 4% in 56F e and increases to ∼ 7% in 208P b at x = 0.1.

• The present results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results from JLab [10], NuTeV [22]
and CCFR [14] but are higher than the older data of EMC [4] and CDHSW [13] which are at low Q2. The
results are in quantitative agreement with the preliminary results of Narbe et al. [41] where a phenomenological
analyses of F EM
(x, Q2) are performed. It should be noted that in the region of low Q2 other
non-perturbative eﬀects in the nuclear medium may be important. Such eﬀects are beyond the scope of this
work and are not considered here.

Presently ongoing DIS experiments at JLab [57] using charged lepton and MINERvA [16] using neutrino/antineutrino
beams with several nuclear targets in the region of low x and Q2, would be able to determine more precisely the
diﬀerence between F EM
(x, Q2) structure functions. The results presented in this paper will be
helpful in understanding the physics of these diﬀerences in a microscopic model.
