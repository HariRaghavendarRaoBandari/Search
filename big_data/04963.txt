Abstract

We investigate the eﬀect of on-site Coulomb repulsion U on the band gap of the electrically gated
bilayer graphene by employing coherent potential approximation in the paramagnetic state, based
on an ionic two-layer Hubbard model. We ﬁnd that, while either the on-site Coulomb repulsion
U or the external perpendicular electric ﬁeld E alone will favor a gapped state in the bilayer
graphene, competition between them will surprisingly lead to a suppression of the gap amplitude.
Our results can be applied to understand the discrepancies of gap size reported from optical and
transport measurements, as well as the puzzling features observed in angular resolved photoemission
spectroscopic study.

INTRODUCTION

Bilayer graphene shares many of the interesting prop-
erties of monolayer graphene1,2, but provides even richer
physics due to the presence of massive chiral quasiparti-
cles3 and has even wider applications due to the possibil-
ity of controlling an infrared gap through doping and
gating4–8. Although the band gap has now been ob-
served in a number of diﬀerent experiments4–6,9–12, open-
ing a possible way towards realizing graphene-based na-
noelectronic and nanophotonic devices13, long-standing
puzzle regarding the gap amplitude has not been solved
between optical and transport measurements, i.e., while
the gap observed in optics is up to 250 meV10,11, that
derived from transport measurements is down to below
10 meV5,12 upon applied electric ﬁeld perpendicular to
the graphene plane.

Therefore, tremendous eﬀort has been made in un-
derstanding the discrepancy. Possible existences of mid-
gap electronic states generated by material imperfections,
such as vacancy14, disorder15,16, or structural distor-
tions17–19, edge states20,21, were extensively discussed.
These hypotheses are mainly based on a consensus that
the low-energy behavior of electrons in bilayer graphene
is well described by the tight-binding model without elec-
tronic interaction2.

But in fact, bilayer graphene has already been pre-
dicted to be unstable to the electronic interaction at half-
ﬁlling due to a non-vanishing density of state present at
the Fermi level1. And the importance of electronic inter-
action has also been widely noticed experimentally in the
bilayer graphene even in the absence of electric ﬁeld22–25.
Though a number of theoretical studies have been made
in searching the ground state with various symmetry
breakings26–31, to our knowledge, it is still lack of a the-
oretical study concerning the intrinsic and unavoidable
correlation eﬀects induced by electronic interaction32,33
on the gate-induced gap.

Since the inconsistency of gap size between optical and
transport measurements occurs irrespective of whether
there is interaction-driven symmetry breaking,
in this
letter, we will investigate the eﬀects of many-body cor-
relation on the band gap by means of coherent potential
approximation (CPA)34,35 in the paramagnetic state of
gated Bernal stacked bilayer graphene which can be qual-
itatively described by an ionic two-layer Hubbard model.
We will ﬁrst present a phase diagram of the model where
a novel interaction-driven metallic state appears between
band and Mott insulating states. Then we ﬁnd that the
gated bilayer graphene is located in the vicinity of the
phase boundary between the band insulator and the cor-
related metal. The inconsistency of the gap size between
optical and transport measurements2,5,10–12,36 can be re-
solved after many-body correlation is taken into account.
Furthermore, our calculated spectrum reveals that exotic
spectra observed in angular resolved photoemission spec-
troscopic study4,18 can also be simply attributed to the
many-body eﬀect without the need to assume lattice im-
perfection. Our study strongly suggests that many-body
correlation should not be neglected in graphene-based
systems.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, we
describe the ionic two-layer Hubbard model and CPA
method.
In Sec. III, we present our results, including
phase diagram, density of states, self-energies, optical
conductivities, and spectral functions. The relevance of
our ﬁndings to various experimental observations is also
discussed in this section. Finally, we do a summary in
Sec. IV.

2.7 eV is chosen as the unit of the energy, while γ1 and γ3
is ﬁxed at 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively1. We are only
interested in half-ﬁlled case which is corresponding to the
charge neutral point in experiments. The Hamiltonian
without the Hubbard term expressed in momentum space
is given in Appendix A.

It is found that, while the system
is insulating at small or large value of U/t, it is metallic at
intermediate value of U/t. The inset is a blow-up of DOS

By applying the alloy analogy approach38, the system
can be viewed as a disordered alloy where an electron
with spin σ moving on a given layer encounters either
a potential of U/2 at a site with a spin −σ present
or −U/2 without, in addition to the external potential
induced by the electric ﬁeld. Then, the model Hamil-
tonian is replaced by a one-particle Hamiltonian with
disorder potential which is of the form H = H0 +
m,i,σ Em,i,σnm,i,σ where Em,i,σ = U/2 with
probability (cid:104)nm,i,−σ(cid:105) or Em,i,σ = −U/2 with probabil-
ity 1 − (cid:104)nm,i,−σ(cid:105). The Green’s function corresponding
to the one-particle Hamiltonian has to be averaged over
all possible disorder conﬁgurations. The averaging can
not be performed exactly. To solve the alloy problem,
the CPA is used34,35. The details of the CPA method
applied to the ionic two-layer Hubbard model are given
in Appendix B. Here, we should stress that, although
above treatment itself has a few shortcomings39, it re-
mains valuable as a computationally simple theory ca-

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Now, we will show that the Coulomb repulsion does
not always enhance the localization of electrons. On the
contrary, it may surprisingly delocalize the electrons in
the presence of gate ﬁeld. Fig. 1 presents the phase dia-
gram in the U/t−E plane. In the absence of electric ﬁeld,
on-site Coulomb repulsion will enhance the localization of
electrons as generally expected41 and at a critical value of
U/t = 3.5, a single metal-to-insulator transition occurs.
If without interaction, any ﬁnite gate ﬁeld will impose
asymmetry between layers which also leads to a gapped
state1,2. However, at a ﬁxed value of gate voltage, tun-
ing on the on-site Coulomb repulsion will ﬁrst suppress,
rather than enhance, the gapped state. As a result, an
intermediate interaction-induced metallic state appears
sandwiched between two insulating states. The consecu-
tive phase transitions from insulator to metal and then
again to insulator are evident by the evolution of density
of state (DOS) as a function of U/t. Fig. 2 (a) shows
the DOS at a ﬁxed value of gate ﬁeld E = 3 V/nm, cor-
responding to ∆/t = 0.378, for three diﬀerent values of
U/t = 0.5 (insulator), U/t = 3.5 (metal), and U/t = 5.0
(insulator).

Σ(ω) =(cid:80)

The nature of the two insulating states can be identi-
ﬁed by analyzing the charge occupation number on each
layer (not shown) and the total self-energy, deﬁned as
m,i Σm,i(ω) where Σm,i(ω) denotes self-energy
of site i of layer m, in these two phases. It is found from
Fig. 2 (b) that, while the imaginary part of self-energy
is negligibly small at a small value of U/t = 0.5, it be-
comes signiﬁcantly large at a large value of U/t = 5.0
and exhibits a divergent behavior at ω (cid:39) ±∆/2 where
the two layers of bilayer graphene are located. The di-
vergence points to the fact that the scattering rate or the
eﬀective mass of quasiparticles on each layer becomes in-
ﬁnite due to the strong electronic correlation. As the
diﬀerence of charge occupation number between the two
layers almost vanishes at U/t = 5.0, the insulating state
should be dominated by the Mott physics. On the con-
trary, the charge disproportionation between the layers
at U/t = 0.5 remains ﬁnite, while the imaginary part
of self-energy is negligibly small, the insulator is a band
insulator.

The interaction-driven metallic state at half-ﬁlling can
be understood from the atomic limit. For U < eEd,
the ground state has two electrons on each site of layer
2 and none on layer 1 due to the energy minimization,
resulting in a band insulator induced by the asymmetry
of charge distribution between layers. The band gap is
of eEd − U . In the opposite condition where U > eEd,
each site on each layer is occupied by one electron and a

3
Mott insulator is formed with a gap U − eEd. Therefore,
in the atomic limit, we clearly see that the interaction U
suppress the gap of the band insulator down to zero, but
only at a single point U = eEd. This metallic point ob-
tained in the atomic limit will be broaden into a metallic
phase when hoppings are nonzero, as shown in our phase
diagram.

Next, we will show that the long-standing experimen-
tal discrepancy regarding the gap size2,5,10–12,36 can be
resolved after many-body correlation is involved. Fig. 3
(a) exhibits the optical conductivities, (see deﬁnition in
Appendix C), at a ﬁxed electric ﬁeld of E = 3.0 V/nm
for several values of U/t. Compared to the experimental
results at E = 3.0 V/nm11, the calculated optical conduc-
tivity at U/t = 1.1 shows a broad peak below 300 meV,
as observed in the experiment. However, due to the in-
volvement of many-body correlation, the peak position
is not corresponding to the band gap. The gap is only
around 16 meV, corresponding to the edge of the optical
conductivity, which is much smaller than the results de-
rived from optical measurements (∼ 250 meV) where the
peak position is improperly taken as the band gap9–11
based on an assumption that electronic correlation can
be completely ignored. In fact, our result is fairly con-

ments (∼ 10 meV)5,12 and magnetotransport study42, in-
dicating that the discrepancy can be naturally ascribed
to the incorrect interpretations of optical data by free
tight-binding model. Compared to the previous propos-
als14,15,17–21 where midgap states induced by the lattice
imperfection which were not detected in optical conduc-
tivity have to be assumed, our explanation only requires
proper treatment of the inevitable correlation eﬀect32,33.
In Fig. 3 (b), we ﬁxed the strength of on-site Coulomb
repulsion at U/t = 1.1 and tuned the perpendicular
gate ﬁeld43. We ﬁnd that the peak position also shows
monotonous gate tunability as observed in optical mea-
surements11. But the gap does not monotonously de-
crease with reduction of gate ﬁeld. From E = 3.0 V/nm
to 1.4 V/nm at U/t = 1.1, the gap is enhanced, while
starting from E = 1.4 V/nm, the gap shrinks as gate
ﬁeld is reduced. As E is smaller than around 0.5 V/nm,
the system becomes metallic with a Drude peak present
at ω = 0. The metallic state may be detected in gated
bilayer graphene at ﬁnite temperature region where sym-
metry breakings are absent. Similar situation also hap-
pens at diﬀerent values of U/t as shown in Fig. 3 (c)
where peak positions and gaps exhibit diﬀerent behav-
iors as a function of gate ﬁeld.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Spectral function along kx direction
around K point in momentum space. The Lorentzian broad-
ening factor of 40 meV is used in order to simulate the en-
ergy resolution in the angular resolved photoemission spectro-
scopic study. The dotted and dashed lines are the band dis-
persions of Bernal stacked and AA-stacking bilayer graphene,
respectively, at E = 1.6 V/nm and U/t = 0.

Recently, an angular resolved photoemission spectro-
scopic study pointed out that the observed spectrum
may indicate a coexistence of massive and massless Dirac
Fermions induced by a possible imperfection of bilayer
graphene18, such as a twist of the layers relative to each
other which leads to a coexistence of the Bernal stacked
bilayer graphene and the AA-stacking bilayer graphene
where the two layers are exactly aligned19. Here, we

4

would like to demonstrate that the puzzling features in
the spectrum can be well understood without assuming
the lattice imperfection if the on-site Coulomb repulsion
is included. Fig. 4 show the spectral function along kx
direction around K point. Again, U/t = 1.1 is used. The
electric ﬁeld is set to be 1.6 V/nm according to the ex-
periment where the electric ﬁeld is estimated from the
gap at valley K point18. We set a Lorentzian broad-
ening factor of 40 meV to simulate the energy resolu-
tion in the experiment18. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the
spectral function looks like a superposition of the band
structures coming from both the Bernal stacked and the
AA-stacking bilayer graphene. Most importantly, promi-
nent kinks observed experimentally which appear below
and above the Fermi level, (or in other words, the neu-
trality point4,18), are also present in the calculated spec-
trum due to the ﬁnite scattering rate induced by many-
body correlation, without need to assume equal popula-
tion of the AA-stacking and the Bernal stacked bilayer
graphene. Such a feature is distinct from the band struc-
ture of a pure gated Bernal stacked bilayer graphene in
the absence of electronic correlations (See dotted line in
Fig. 4). The vague AA-like bands between gap, derived
experimentally18, may be due to the ﬁnite experimental
energy resolution as well as the ignorance of suppression
of gap by the Coulomb repulsion in experimental analy-
sis.

Finally, we would like to mention that the suppression
of gate-induced band gap by onsite Coulomb repulsion
should always happen even in the presence of symmetry
breaking. This can be ﬁrst conﬁrmed by a mean-ﬁeld cal-
culation within the Hartree-Fock approximation. More-
over, based on results of a similar model, called ionic
Hubbard model, given by quantum Monte Carlo simu-
lations44, we argue that the interaction-driven metallic
state most probably persists even in the presence of mag-
netism.

IV. SUMMARY

In conclusion, we use an ionic two-layer Hubbard
model to study the many-body eﬀect on the gated Bernal
stacked bilayer graphene. We ﬁnd that the on-site
Coulomb repulsion will suppress, rather than enhance,
the gate-induced gap in the bilayer graphene. By consid-
ering the on-site Coulomb repulsion, the fundamental dis-
crepancy of gap size between transport and optical mea-
surements is resolved and the puzzling features observed
in angular resolved photoemission spectroscopic studies
can be well understood, without assumption of lattice
imperfection. However, in order to quantitatively de-
scribe all the experimental results, other eﬀects like non-
local electronic correlations, electron-phonon couplings,
and disorders have to be involved. Our study indicate
that the intrinsic and unavoidable many-body correlation
should be seriously taken into account in graphene-based
devices.

Hubbard38 viewed the electron correlation problem as
a disordered alloy where an electron with spin σ moving
on a given layer encounters either a potential of U/2 at a
site with a spin −σ present or −U/2 without, in addition
to the external potential induced by the electric ﬁeld.

So we can approximate the many-body Hamiltonian

by the one-electron Hamiltonian

here (cid:104)nm,i,σ(cid:105) is the average electron occupancy per site
for sublattice i with spin σ in layer m. The Green’s
function corresponding to the one-particle Hamiltonian
has to be averaged over all possible disorder conﬁgura-
tions. The averaging can not be performed exactly. To
solve the alloy problem, the coherent potential approx-
imation (CPA) is used34,35,45,46, where the disorder po-
tential Em,i,σ is replaced by a local complex and energy-
dependent self-energy.

Okada, Nano Lett. 10, 3888 (2010). Though the variable
range hopping (VRH), typically observed in strongly dis-
ordered two-dimensional systems, was proposed to play a
role in the temperature dependence of conductance in this
reference, it was ruled out in the Ref.12. In addition, Ref.5
shows that the exponent is deviated from 1/3, indicating
that the explanation of VRH to the discrepancy between
transport and optical measurements is questionable.

gated electric ﬁeld, the relative strength of U with respect
to hoppings can be tuned by stretching bilayer graphene

note that the gap in this reference is deﬁned as the screened
electric ﬁeld, which is corresponding to the gap at the val-
ley K point. Considering the Mexican-hat-like band dis-
persion around valley K point, the true gap should be
comparable to what we observed.

43 The reason why we only compare our result with experi-
mental one for E = 3 V/nm is that, in the experimental
paper (Fig. 2 of Ref. 11), only the curve for E = 3 V/nm
clearly shows a prominent peak which can be attributed
to the transition of electrons from the valence band to
the conduction band, in addition to a very sharp spec-
tral feature which is attributed to the zone center G-mode
phonon in graphene. Other curves either do not show any
deﬁnite peak or only present one broad peak with compli-
cated structure which may be due to the mixture of the
peaks contributed from phonons and electrons.
