Abstract. We consider the Schr¨odinger operator Lα on the half-line with a
periodic background potential and a perturbation which consists of two parts:
a summable potential and the slowly decaying Wigner–von Neumann potential
c sin(2ωx+δ)
2 , 1). The continuous spectrum of this operator has
the same band-gap structure as the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed
periodic operator. In every band there exist two points, called critical, where
the eigenfunction equation has square summable solutions. Every critical point
νcr is an eigenvalue of the operator Lα for some value of the boundary param-
eter α = αcr, speciﬁc to that particular point. We prove that for α 6= αcr the
spectral density of the operator Lα has a zero of the exponential type at νcr.

1. Introduction

x

Wigner–von Neumann potential c sin(2ωx)

gives probably the simplest example of
an eigenvalue embedded into the continuous spectrum of the Schr¨odinger operator
on the half-line. The eigenvalue can appear at the point ω2 which is called critical or
resonance point, and appears for only one boundary condition and only if |c| > 2|ω|.
At this point a square summable solution of the eigenfunction equation exists,
and for one value of the boundary parameter it satisﬁes the boundary condition.
This situation is very unstable: the eigenvalue disappears if one slightly changes
the boundary condition or adds a summable perturbation to the potential. This
eigenvalue can be related to resonances, which are poles on the unphysical sheet of
the analytic continuation of the Green’s function, but may or may not exist. It is
meaningful to consider objects that are stable under small perturbations. One can
study properties of the Weyl’s m-function or the spectral density ρ′ of the operator
(which is the derivative of the spectral function [24]).

In the present paper we study properties of the spectral density of the Schr¨odinger

operator Lα deﬁned by the diﬀerential expression

· α ∈ [0, π).

Under these assumptions the operator Lα is self-adjoint [23].
As it was shown by Kurasov and Naboko in [22], the absolutely continuous
spectrum of the operator given by the expression L on the whole real line coincides
with the spectrum of the corresponding unperturbed periodic operator on the whole
line,

(1.6)

Lper : ψ 7→ −ψ′′ + qψ,

domLper = {ψ ∈ L2(R) ∩ H 2

where

λ0 < µ0 ≤ µ1 < λ1 ≤ λ2 < µ2 ≤ µ3 < λ3 ≤ λ4 < ...

(1.8)
In turn, the absolutely continuous spectrum of Lα coincides as a set with the
spectrum of Lper, although the latter has multiplicity two, whereas the former is
simple. Moreover, Kurasov and Naboko in [22] showed that in every band [λj, µj]
or [µj, λj ] there exist two critical points νj+ and νj−. The type of asymptotics of
generalised eigenvectors (solutions of the eigenfunction equation) at these points
is diﬀerent from that type in other points of the absolutely continuous spectrum.
At each of the critical points there exists a subordinate solution and hence each of
these points can be an eigenvalue of the operator Lα as long as this solution belongs
to L2(R+) and satisﬁes the boundary condition. Locations of the points νj± are
determined by the conditions [22]

where k is the quasi-momentum of the periodic operator Lper and {·} is the standard
fractional part function. The condition 2aω

coincide with the endpoints of bands and with each other.

The expression (1.15) was found in [29] and the expression (1.16) for the case
γ ∈ ( 1
2 , 1) is given by Lemma 3.1 of the present paper (for the case γ = 1 a slight
modiﬁcation of this lemma is needed).

In [29] we had the following result.

Proposition 1.2 ([29]). Let the operator Lα be deﬁned by (1.3) and (1.4) where
L is given by (1.1), and let the conditions (1.5) hold with γ = 1. Let ρ′α be the
spectral density of Lα, let νj± and ϕα be deﬁned by (1.9) and (1.10), respectively.
Let νcr ∈ {νj+, νj−, j ≥ 0} be one of the critical points and αcr be deﬁned in
Proposition 1.1. If α 6= αcr, then there exist two non-zero one-side limits

where βcr is given by the expression (1.15).

This means that the spectral density of the operator Lα at a critical point in the
generic situation α 6= αcr has zeroes of the power type, and the power is twice the
rate of decay of the subordinate solution at this critical point. The main result of
the present paper is the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. Let the operator Lα be deﬁned by (1.3) and (1.4) where L is given
by (1.1), and let the conditions (1.5) hold with γ ∈ ( 1

Relation between, on the one hand, the behaviour at inﬁnity of the subordinate
solution (whenever it exists) compared to the behaviour of a non-subordinate one
and, on the other hand, the normal boundary behaviour of the Weyl’s m-function
was, in a general situation, established by Jitomirskaya–Last [16] and Remling [31].
However, in our case it yields only a trivial result: that for α 6= αcr one has
|mα(νcr + iε)| = O(1) and for α = αcr one has |mα(νcr + iε)| ≍ 1
ε as ε → 0+.
Spectral density is related to the boundary behaviour of the Weyl’s m-function,
and one can say in these terms that we study ρ′α(νcr + ε) = 1
π Im mα(νcr + ε + i0)
as ε → 0, which, clearly, can behave quite diﬀerently to Im mα(νcr + iε).
The case γ = 1 was earlier considered in detail by Hinton–Klaus–Shaw [14],
Klaus [17] and Behncke [2, 3, 4]. They included no periodic background potentials.
Hinton, Klaus and Shaw considered instead an inﬁnite sum of Wigner–von Neumann
terms, while Behncke added Dirac operators into consideration. Their methods are
speciﬁc to the models they study, while in [29] we proposed an approach which
is based on reducing the problem to a certain discrete linear system with small
parameter which essentially models the behaviour of solutions of the Schr¨odinger
equation (we call it the “model problem”). This allowed for stating the result in
certain generality and using it to study a discrete analogue, a Jacobi matrix [15, 32].
Condition (1.17) in the formulation of the result is of technical nature. We
would like to note here that in [14] for the case γ = 1 an analogous condition was
imposed on the summable part q1 of the potential, however, with α1 = 1. It was
left as an open question whether this condition could be weakened to include every
q1 ∈ L1(R+), see the question (4 ) in the ﬁnal section of [14]. For the case γ = 1
the answer is positive, as our analysis in [29] suggests. For the case γ ∈ ( 1
2 , 1) we
do not have the answer.

In the case γ ∈ ( 1

2 , 1) we reduce the problem to a model linear diﬀerential, rather
than discrete, system. In fact, it is possible to do the same in the case γ = 1, and
then the idea of the method of [29] would work and should lead to the same result
as there, but in an easier way (however, on this way we would lose the discrete
case). For γ < 1 this idea does not produce the result anymore, but can only be
used at one of the stages (in Section 5). On the whole, the method of the present

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

paper is diﬀerent from the method of [29], which is insuﬃcient for the situation
considered here.

Wigner–von Neumann potentials originally aroused interest as giving an explicit
example of an eigenvalue embedded into continuous spectrum [34]. Since then they
have been studied by many authors (for example, the papers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14, 17,
20, 21, 22, 25, and many more). Embedded eigenvalues created by such potentials
have been observed in experiment, see [7]. Zeroes of density divide the absolutely
continuous spectrum into independent parts and for this reason are sometimes called
pseudogaps.

A paper by Kreimer, Last and Simon [19] should be also mentioned as an example
of the spectral density analysis (in that case of the discrete Schr¨odinger operator
with slowly decaying potential, near the endpoints of the absolutely continuous
spectrum). Results on the behaviour of the spectral density have been recently
used by Lukic [26] to construct test sequences in the proof of higher-order Szeg˝o
theorems for CMV matrices.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the Titchmarsh–
Weyl formula for the spectral density of the operator Lα which was proved in [23].
The formula expresses ρ′α(λ) in terms of asymptotic coeﬃcients of the solution
ϕα(x, λ) as x → +∞. In Section 3 we rewrite the eigenfunction equation of Lα as
a model system with a small parameter ε and express the spectral density in terms
of a certain solution of that system. In Section 4 we transform the model system
to a new form and determine ﬁve regions of the positive coordinate half-line where
asymptotic analysis of solutions as ε → 0 should be carried out in diﬀerent ways.
In Sections 5–9 we consider each of the regions separately and ﬁnd asymptotics
of solutions of the model system. In Section 10 we match the results in order to
obtain the double asymptotics, in the coordinate and in the small parameter, of
the solution of the model system in terms of which the spectral density of Lα was
earlier expressed. In Section 11 we prove the main result of the paper, Theorem
1.1.

We denote by M 2×2(R) and M 2×2(C) matrices of two rows and two columns
with real and, respectively, complex entries and use the following notation for two
basic vectors in C2:

(1.21)

e+ :=(cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19) , e− :=(cid:18) 0
1 (cid:19) .

2. Preliminaries

The spectrum of the periodic Schr¨odinger operator Lper consists of inﬁnitely
many intervals (1.7), see [11, Theorem 2.3.1], where λj and µj are the eigenvalues
of the Sturm–Liouville problem deﬁned by the diﬀerential expression L on the
interval [0, a] with, respectively, periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions.
Let us denote by ∂ the set of the endpoints of the spectral bands of Lper,
(2.1)

∂ := {λj, µj, j ≥ 0},

including the case when the endpoints of the neighbouring bands coincide. Spectral
properties of the operator Lper are related to the quasi-momentum

k(λ) := −i ln  D(λ) +pD2(λ) − 4

2

! ,

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

where the entire function D is the trace of the monodromy matrix of the periodic
equation. We can choose the branch of k so that

k(λ0) = 0, k(µ0) = k(µ1) = π, k(λ1) = k(λ2) = 2π, ...,

k(λ) ∈ R and k′(λ) > 0,
k(λ) ∈ C+,

if λ ∈ σ(Lper)\∂,
if λ ∈ C+,

see [11, Theorem 2.3.1]. The eigenfunction equation of Lper,

−ψ′′(x) + q(x)ψ(x) = λψ(x),

has two solutions ψ+(x, λ) and ψ−(x, λ) (Bloch solutions) which satisfy the quasi-
periodic conditions:

(2.2)

ψ±(x + a, λ) ≡ e±ik(λ)ψ±(x, λ),

Each of them is deﬁned uniquely up to multiplication by a coeﬃcient which depends
on λ. It is possible to choose these coeﬃcients so that for every x ≥ 0 the functions
ψ±(x,·) and ψ′
±(x,·), and hence their Wronskian W{ψ+, ψ−}(·), are analytic in
C+ and continuous up to the set σ(Lper)\∂. Moreover, it is possible for every
λ ∈ σ(Lper)\∂ to have

ψ+(x, λ) ≡ ψ−(x, λ) and iW{ψ+, ψ−}(λ) < 0.

In what follows we assume that such a choice of the coeﬃcients is made. Bloch
solutions can be written in another form:

ψ±(x, λ) = e±ik(λ) x

a p±(x, λ),

where the functions p+(x, λ) and p−(x, λ) are periodic with the period a in the
variable x and have the same properties as ψ±(x, λ) in the variable λ.

It is well known that some of spectral properties of one-dimensional Schr¨odinger
operators can be written in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of their generalised
eigenvectors (see, for example, [12]).
In particular, the spectral density of the
operator can be expressed in terms of the Jost function by the Titchmarsh–Weyl
formula. The eigenfunction equation Lψ = λψ is a small perturbation of the
periodic equation −ψ′′(x) + q(x)ψ(x) = λψ(x) in the sense that asymptotically ϕα
is some linear combination of two Bloch solutions.
Proposition 2.1 ([23]). Let the operator Lα be deﬁned by (1.3) and (1.4) where
L is given by (1.1), and let the conditions (1.5) hold. Let ρ′α be the spectral density
of the operator Lα, and νj±, ϕα, σ(Lper), ∂, ψ± be deﬁned by (1.9), (1.10), (1.7),
(2.1), (2.2), respectively. For every ﬁxed λ ∈ σ(Lper)\(∂ ∪ {νj+, νj−, j ≥ 0}) there
exists Aα(λ) such that, as x → +∞,
(2.3)

ϕα(x, λ) = Aα(λ)ψ−(x, λ) + Aα(λ)ψ+(x, λ) + o(1),
−(x, λ) + Aα(λ)ψ′+(x, λ) + o(1),
ϕ′α(x, λ) = Aα(λ)ψ′
and the following equality (the Titchmarsh–Weyl formula) holds:

(2.4)

ρ′α(λ) =

1

2π|W{ψ+, ψ−}(λ)| |Aα(λ)|2 .

Here Aα is essentially the Jost function Mα (up to a coeﬃcient: Aα(λ) =
− Mα(λ)
W{ψ+,ψ−}(λ) ). This result is a generalisation of the classic Titchmarsh–Weyl (or
Kodaira) formula [18, 33]. A variant of this formula for the Schr¨odinger operator
with Wigner–von Neumann potential without the periodic background (q(x) ≡ 0)

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

8

follows from results of [28]. In the case of discrete Schr¨odinger operator with the
Wigner–von Neumann potential an analogous formula is also known, see [10, 15].

3. Reduction to the model problem

In this section we reduce the eigenfunction equation Lψ = λψ to a specially
constructed linear diﬀerential system and express the modulus of the coeﬃcient Aα
from the Titchmarsh–Weyl formula (2.4) in terms of a certain solution of this new
system.

Lemma 3.1. Let the conditions of Theorem 1.1 hold and let νcr ∈ {νj+, νj−, j ≥ 0}
be one of the critical points.

(q, q1, c, ω, γ, δ and α) and have the following properties:

neighbourhood of the critical point Uj+ so that its closure lies inside the band with
the index j and does not contain the point νj−. Let

bTj+(x, λ) is continuous in λ for every x ∈ [0, +∞) and satisﬁes the estimate

Let us check that the matrix Rcr has real entries. Fix some x ∈ [0,∞) and λ ∈

Ucr. From the expression (3.8) for bR using that q1(x) ∈ R and iW{ψ+, ψ−}(λ) < 0
we see that the matrix bR(x, λ) has the following conjugation property:

bR11(x, λ) = bR22(x, λ), bR12(x, λ) = bR21(x, λ).

This property is preserved for sums or products as well as for real analytic functions
of such matrices. As it is clear from the formulae (3.11), (3.12) and (3.13), this
property holds for the matrices Sn(x, λ), S (1)

By the asymptotic Levinson theorem [8, Theorem 8.1] this system has two solutions

(3.28)

w±cr(x) = exp(cid:18)±

βcrx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (e± + o(1)) as x → +∞.

Since the coeﬃcients of the system are real-valued, w−cr(x) ∈ R2 for every x ∈
[0, +∞) (since w−cr(x) is also a solution which has the same asymptotics and hence
is proportional to w−cr(x) with the coeﬃcient one). So there exists the unique
αcr ∈ [0, π) such that the vector gcr,αcr is proportional to w−cr(0):

gcr,αcr = dcr−w−cr(0),

and hence

wcr,αcr (x, νcr) = dcr−w−cr(x),

From this and (3.28) the asymptotics (3.4) follows, and from it using the relation
(3.27) we get the asymptotics (1.12) of the solution ϕαcr (x, νcr) as x → +∞. For
every α 6= αcr due to (3.28) and since wcr,α(0, νcr) ∦ w−cr(0) we have:

wcr,α(x, νcr) = dcr(α) exp(cid:18) βcrx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (e+ + o(1)) as x → +∞.

The coeﬃcient dcr(α) is a linear functional on R2, the space of initial conditions.
Hence it can be expressed in terms of the scalar product with some ﬁxed vector, or

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

16

in terms of the angle between this vector and the vector(cid:18) sin α

functional vanishes for αcr, therefore it should be

cos α (cid:19). Clearly this

dcr(α) = dcr+ sin(α − αcr)

with some dcr+ ∈ R. From this we get the asymptotics (3.4), and using the relation
(3.27) the asymptotics (1.14) of ϕα(x, νcr) as x → +∞. This completes the proof.

4. The model problem

In this section we study the system (3.2) in the general setting and use only the
objects and the properties that are listed in Lemma 3.1. We pass from the spectral
parameter λ to the small parameter ε0 supposing that the positive constant β,
the remainder matrix R(x, ε0) with possibly complex entries and the vector of the
initial condition f ∈ C2 are given. In such a setting we are able to establish the
asymptotics as x → +∞ and then as ε0 → 0 of solutions of the model system
(4.1)

sin(ε0x) − cos(ε0x) (cid:19) + R(x, ε0)(cid:19) u(x).

We consider this system for ε0 ∈ U0, where U0 is some interval with the midpoint
zero. Let αr, cr > 0 and

r(x) :=

.

We assume the following:

β > 0,
γ ∈ ( 1
R(x,·) for every x ∈ [0, +∞) is continuous in U0,
kR(x, ε)k < r(x) for every x ∈ [0, +∞) and ε0 ∈ U0.



Let us deﬁne for every ε0 ∈ U0 and f ∈ C2 the solution u(x, ε0, f ) of the Cauchy
problem for the system (4.1) with the initial condition

u(0, ε0, f ) = f.

(4.4)
First we need to establish asymptotics of this solution as x → +∞ for every ﬁxed
ε0 ∈ U0. We do this in the same way as in Lemma 3.1.
Lemma 4.1. Let the conditions (4.3) and (4.2) hold, let f ∈ C2 and let u(x, ε0, f )
be the solution of the system (4.1) with the initial condition (4.4).
1. For every ε0 6= 0 and f ∈ C2 there exists a ﬁnite non-zero limit
u(x, ε0, f ).
2. For ε0 = 0 and every f ∈ C2 the following asymptotics holds:

x→+∞

lim

u(x, 0, f ) = exp(cid:18) βx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (Φ(f )e+ + o(1)) as x → +∞,

where Φ is a linear functional in C2. This functional has a one-dimensional kernel
which consists of the vector f− (and its multiples) such that

u(x, 0, f−) = exp(cid:18)−

βx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (e− + o(1)) as x → +∞.

Proof. 1. Just as in the previous section we make a Harris–Lutz transformation

x

u(x) = exp(bTu(x, ε0))u1(x) with
bTu(x, ε0) := −Z +∞
For ε0 6= 0 one has bTu(x, ε0) = O(cid:0) 1
R1(x, ε0) = O(cid:18) 1

with

sin(ε0x′)

u′1(x) = R1(x, ε0)u1(x)

x1+α1(cid:19) as x → +∞,

estimates as in the proof of Lemma 3.1 we arrive at the system

which means that R1(·, ε0) ∈ L1(R+, M 2×2(C)). The asymptotic Levinson theorem
[8, Theorem 8.1] is applicable to this system and yields the existence of two solutions
which have limits e+ and e− as x → +∞. Hence every solution u1(x) has a non-
goes to zero at inﬁnity.
2. If ε0 = 0, then the asymptotic Levinson theorem is directly applicable to the
system (4.1). Using it we conclude that there exists a solution with the asymptotics

zero limit as x → +∞. The same is true for every solution u(x), because bTu(x, ε0)

exp(cid:18)−

βx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (e− + o(1)) as x → +∞.

Let us take as f− the value of this solution at zero. Again by the Levinson theorem
there exists another solution, with the asymptotics

Therefore

exp(cid:18) βx1−γ
u(x, ε0, f ) = exp(cid:18) βx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (e+ + o(1)) as x → +∞.
1 − γ (cid:19) (Φ(f )e+ + o(1)) as x → +∞.

with some coeﬃcient Φ(f ) which depends on f linearly and which is such that
Φ(f−) = 0 and dim ker Φ = 1. From [23, Lemma 4.2, case (2)] one can write out
the formula for Φ:

(4.5)

(cid:3)

This completes the proof.

The main result concerning the model problem is given by the following theorem
u(x, ε0, f ) as ε0 → 0 and which

which establishes the behaviour of the limit

will be proved in Section 10.
Theorem 4.1. Let the conditions (4.3) and (4.2) hold, let f ∈ C2\{0} and let
u(x, ε0, f ) be the solution of the system (4.1) with the initial condition (4.4). The
following asymptotic holds:

Note that the asymptotics of

u(x, ε0, f ) contains Φ(f ) which is responsible
for the behaviour of solutions for the ﬁxed value of the parameter, ε0 = 0. This is
explained by the multiscale nature of the problem: Φ(f ) may be considered as the
result of development of the solution in the “fast” variable x which then enters the
initial condition for the scaled system in the “slow” variable t. We consider this
scaled system below.

x→+∞

4.1. Reformulation. The system (4.1) was used in [29] for study of the case γ = 1.
Let us see why in the present form it is no longer suitable for the case γ ∈ ( 1
2 , 1).
Consider ε0 > 0. Scaling of the independent variable x = t
leads to the system
ε0
which has in some sense the following limit as ε0 → 0+:

sin t − cos t (cid:19) v(t),

t (cid:18) cos t
and the convergence is uniform in t. This system can be further analysed as t →
+∞. If we did the same for the case γ ∈ ( 1

sin t − cos t (cid:19) v(t),

2 , 1), we would come the system

which contains a small parameter at the derivative. This is why the diﬀerence
between the cases γ = 1 and γ ∈ ( 1
2 , 1) is essential. Moreover, in our case one needs
to consider a diﬀerent scale of the independent variable rather than x = ε−1
0 t,
namely x = ε− 1
t. This is not immediately clear: such a substitution does not
eliminate the small parameter from the derivative and leads to growing oscillations

Each of the systems (4.12) and (4.13) has an analytic part (A+

coeﬃcient matrix and a remainder (R+
2 or R−2 ) which is small in some sense. We
will show that these remainders can be ignored away from zero. If there were no
remainders, the well developed analytic theory would work here, see [35, Chap-

ter VIII]. The eigenvalues of both matrices A±2 (t) are the same: q β2

is the turning point for both systems (4.12). At this point eigenvalues of A±2
coincide, and each of two matrices is similar to a Jordan block. The behaviour as
ε → 0+ of solutions of both systems (4.12) has diﬀerent character in the intervals
(0, t0) and (t0, +∞), so one needs to consider these intervals separately. In order
to match the results in these two intervals we consider a small neighbourhood of
the turning point and introduce a diﬀerent (now again “fast”) variable z there.
However, this is still not enough: we need to consider intermediate regions at both
sides of the turning point and use a diﬀerent method there to treat the remainders
R±2 . Only then matching of all the results can be done to trace the behaviour of
u±2 (t, ε, f ) from t = 0 to t = +∞.
following way:

as ε → 0+. Note that due to the oscillations in (4.15) u±2 (t, ε, f ) cannot have limits
as t → +∞, and only limits of their norms exist. This can be interpreted in the
sense that the vector Φ(f )e+ plays the role of the initial condition for the systems
(4.12), and the growth of norms of the solutions u±2 takes place on the interval
(0, t0) at the rate determined by the positive eigenvalue of the matrices A±2 .

4.2. Regions of the half-line. In the next ﬁve sections we analyse the asymptotic
behaviour of solutions of the system (4.12) in ﬁve diﬀerent regions of the positive
half-line. In each of these regions we need to use appropriate transformations in
order to simplify the system. Then we combine the results to match asymptotics,
and this gives the asymptotic behaviour of the limit of the norm of the solution
u+
2 (t, ε, f ) at t = +∞ as ε → 0+. In Section 10 we will see that there is no need to
perform a parallel study for the second system (4.13) and the solution u−2 . We take
points tI−II ∈ (0, t0) and tIV −V ∈ (t0, +∞) suﬃciently close to the turning point
t0. On the interval [tI−II, tIV −V ] we use the variable z = ε− 2
this interval corresponds to [−Z2(ε), Z2(ε)] (travelled in the opposite direction).
We further divide this interval into three regions by the points ±Z0 which in the
variable t correspond to the points tII−III (ε) and tIII−IV (ε). The regions are

ﬁnd a matrix solution and its asymptotics, and for the region V we ﬁnd a family of
solutions determined by their behaviour as t → +∞ and establish their asymptotics
as ε → 0+.
In section devoted to the regions II–V we formulate results in a general form,
that is for systems of the kind of (4.12), imposing diﬀerent suﬃcient conditions on
remainders of these systems. We as well check that these conditions are satisﬁed for
the remainder R+
2 of the system (4.12) itself. In notation for each of these systems
and for other related objects we use indices which correspond to the region that is
considered.

Lemma 5.1. Let the conditions (4.3) and (4.2) hold and let for f ∈ C2 the function
u(x, ε0, f ) be the solution of the system (4.1) with the initial condition (4.4). Let
u+
2 (t, ε, f ) be given by (4.15) with the use of the deﬁnitions (4.9) of t and (4.10) of
ε, and thus be a solution of the system (5.1) where R+
2 (t, ε) is given by (4.14). For
every t ∈ (0, t0) and ε ∈ U the following asymptotics holds:

deﬁned in Lemma 4.1.

ε

First let us prove an a priori estimate.

Lemma 5.2. Let tI ∈ (0, t0). Under the conditions of Lemma 5.1 there exists
c13 > 0 such that for every t ∈ [0, tI ], ε ∈ U and f ∈ C2

immediately gives:

1. KI (ε) → KI (0) as ε → 0+ in the norm of B(L∞((0, tI ), C2)).
2. KI (0)hI,3(ε, f ) → KI (0)hI,3(0, f ) as ε → 0+ in the norm of L∞((0, tI ), C2).

In the expression under the integral SI is summable and hI,3 is point-wise conver-
gent to zero and uniformly bounded by Lemma 5.3. Therefore, by the Lebegue’s
dominated convergence theorem, the integral converges to zero as ε → 0+.
(cid:3)

Now we are able to prove convergence of the solution.

Lemma 5.5. Let the conditions of Lemma 5.1 hold and let uI,3 be deﬁned by (5.13).
For every t ∈ (0, t0) there exists the limit

which satisﬁes the following integral equation on the interval [0, t0) :

uI,3(t, ε, f ) =: uI,3(t, 0, f ),

where KI (0) is given by (5.18), and hI,3(0, f ) is deﬁned in Lemma 5.3.

Remark 5.3. Note that again, as with hI,3(ε, f ), there is no convergence in the
norm of L∞((0, tI ), C2). However, the diﬀerence uI,3(ε, f )− hI,3(ε, f ) converges in
this norm.

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

27

Proof. Take some tI ∈ (0, t0). Let us rewrite the equation (5.19) as

uI,3(ε, f ) − hI,3(ε, f ) = KI (ε)hI,3(ε, f ) + KI (ε)(uI,3(ε, f ) − hI,3(ε, f ))

and then as

uI,3(ε, f ) − hI,3(ε, f ) = (I − KI (ε))−1KI (ε)hI,3(ε, f ).

(5.25)
By Lemma 5.4, due to the boundedness of hI,3(ε, f ) in the norm of L∞((0, tI ), C2)
provided by Lemma 5.5, we have:
KI (ε)hI,3(ε, f ) = (KI (ε) − KI (0))hI,3(ε, f ) + KI (0)hI,3(ε, f ) → KI (0)hI,3(0, f )
as ε → 0+. Since KI (ε) are Volterra operators, the norms k(I − KI (ε))−1k ≤
exp(kKI (ε)k) are bounded as ε → 0+. Therefore
(I −KI (ε))−1 = (I + (I −KI (ε))−1(KI (ε)−KI (0)))(I −KI (0))−1 → (I − KI (0))−1
in the norm of B(L∞((0, tI ), C2)). Hence in the equality (5.25) there exists the
limit

lim
ε→0+

(uI,3(ε, f ) − hI,3(ε, f )) = (I − KI (0))−1KI (0)hI,3(0, f )

in the norm of L∞((0, tI ), C2) which means that uI,3(t, ε, f ) − hI,3(t, ε, f ) has a
limit for every t ∈ [0, tI] and uniformly in t. Since tI was chosen arbitrarily, the
limit exists for every t ∈ (0, t0), however, without uniformity. By Lemma 5.3 for
every t ∈ (0, t0) the function hI,3(t, ε, f ) has a limit as ε → 0+, also not uniform in
t. On the interval [0, tI] we have the equality

uI,3(0, f ) = hI,3(0, f ) + (I − KI (0))−1KI (0)hI,3(0, f ).

Applying I − KI (0) to both sides we arrive at the formula (5.24).

Now we can prove Lemma 5.1.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 5.1. Equation (5.24) is in fact simpler than it looks: it is merely
an equation for the upper component of uI,3 which can be solved explicitly. Indeed,
using the formulae (5.20) and (5.18) for the initial condition and the kernel we get
the equation

and the solution is given by the expression

uI,3(t, 0, f ) = Φ(f )e+ +Z t

There exists the solution uV,2(t, ε, g) of the system (6.13) such that the following
holds.

and the limit is uniform with respect to t ∈ [tV , +∞) for every tV ∈ (t0, +∞).
Proof of the item 1. We can use directly the asymptotic Levinson theorem. The
coeﬃcient matrix of the system (6.13) is summable near inﬁnity: from (6.6) it is
clear that SV ∈ L1((tV , +∞), M 2×2(C)), and RV,1 is summable due to Lemma 6.2.
Conditions of the asymptotic Levinson theorem [8, Theorem 8.1] are satisﬁed which
gives the result. We will prove the item 2. later.

which is also deﬁned by this rule for ε = 0.

Remark 6.1. Until this moment we were following the scheme which was already
used for the region I. This analogy does not go further: the operators KV (ε) do
not converge in the norm of B(L∞((tV , +∞), C2)), while the solutions uV,2(ε, g) do
converge in the norm of L∞((tV , +∞), C2).
Lemma 6.5. Let the conditions of Lemma 6.4 hold, tV ∈ (t0, +∞) and KV (ε)
be the operator in the space L∞((tV , +∞), C2) deﬁned by (6.21) with the use of
expressions (6.18) and (6.19). Operator KV (ε) converges in the strong sense to the
operator KV (0) as ε → 0+, and (I − KV (ε))−1 converges in the strong sense to
(I − KV (0))−1.

Since u ∈ L∞((tV , +∞), C2) was arbitrary, this proves the strong convergence and
thus completes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Now we are able to prove the remaining part of Lemma 6.4.

Proof of Lemma 6.4, item 2. Rewriting the equation (6.20) as

uV,2(ε, g) = (I − KV (ε))−1g

we use Lemma 6.5 to conclude that uV,2(ε, g) → uV,2(0, g) as ε → 0+ in the norm
of L∞((tV , +∞), C2), where
(6.22)
which means that for every g ∈ C2 and t ∈ [tV , +∞), uV,2(t, ε, g) converges as
ε → 0+ to uV,2(t, 0, g) uniformly with respect to t in this interval. Applying the
operator I − KV (0) to both sides of the equality (6.22) we get:

uV,2(0, g) := (I − KV (0))−1g,

Solution of this equation is

diag SV (τ )uV,2(τ, 0, g)dτ.

uV,2(t, 0, g) = g −Z +∞
uV,2(t, 0, g) = exp(cid:18)−Z +∞

t

t

diag SV (τ )dτ(cid:19) g,

which coincides with the expression in (6.15) and thus completes the proof.

(cid:3)

The proof of Lemma 6.1 follows.

Proof of Lemma 6.1. Convergence in (6.9) follows from Lemma 6.4 and substitu-
tion of the limit (6.15) to the relations (6.12) and (6.2). To prove convergence in
(6.10) ﬁrst note that uV (t, ε, g) is bounded as t → +∞, because

kuV (t, ε, g)k ≤ kTV (t)kkuV,2(t, ε, g)k

and uV,2(t, ε, g) is bounded by Lemma 6.4. Then, since

TV (t) →(cid:18) 1
i −i (cid:19) is unitary, by Lemma 6.4 we have the convergence

and the matrix 1√2(cid:18) 1
of the norm: kuV (t, ε, g)k → √2kgk as → +∞. This completes the proof.

In the region I our analysis was based on the fact that the term SI is summable
over the whole interval. Since SI is not summable up to the turning point t0 =
(2β)
γ , the integral containing SI diverges as t approaches t0, so Lemma 5.1 does
not work for the interval (0, t0]. In the same way and for the same reason Lemma 6.1
does not work for the interval [t0, +∞). This can be seen as an eﬀect of the interplay
between the ﬁrst and the second terms in the coeﬃcient matrix of the system (7.3)
which should be taken into account. We do this by scaling the independent variable
near the turning point. To choose the new scale observe that near the turning point

To prove Lemma 7.2 we need to further divide the interval [Z0, Z2(ε)] into two
parts by the point Z1(ε) such that Z1(ε) → +∞ and Z1(ε) = o(ε− 2
3 ) as ε → 0+
which we will choose later, in (7.25). On the ﬁrst subinterval [Z0, Z1(ε)] solutions
of the system (7.8) behave like solutions of the free system (7.15) which does not
contain ε. On the second subinterval [Z1(ε), Z2(ε)] one cannot neglect the terms
3 √z and ε
2
3 z, so the free system should depend on ε. Nevertheless, the answer
ε
in the second subinterval is even simpler, because Z1(ε) → +∞ and solutions are
already in their asymptotic regime as z → +∞.
Remark 7.1. Since we are interested only in the behaviour as ε → 0+ we do not
need to ensure that the inequality Z0 < Z1(ε) < Z2(ε) holds for every ε ∈ U . It is
enough if it holds for suﬃciently small values of ε.

For both subintervals one has to prove that the remainder RII,2 does not af-
fect the asymptotics. Some diﬃculty in showing this is that the second term
of the coeﬃcient matrix has oﬀ-diagonal entries. To get rid of them we use the
Harris–Lutz transformation, although slightly diﬀerent for subintervals [Z0, Z1(ε)]
and [Z1(ε), Z2(ε)]. Let us see how it works generally in the hyperbolic case [13].

7.1. Formulae for the Harris–Lutz transformation. Suppose that we start
with the linear diﬀerential system in C2

u′ = (Λ + S + R)u,

where Λ = diag{λ1, λ2} and Re λ1 > Re λ2. The aim is to transform it to the
system

u′1 = (Λ + diag S + R1)u1

by the substitution u = (I + bT )u1. We suppose that (I + bT ) is invertible. This

gives

(I + bT )u′ = (Λ + ΛbT − bT ′ + S + (SbT + R(I + bT )))u1

This, in particular, implies

(7.20)

If one represents bT as

diﬀerentiation gives

[Λ,bT ] − bT ′ = −Sad.

where [·,·] is the commutator of matrices and

Let Sd := diag S, Sad := S − Sd. We need the following equality:

0 (λ2 − λ1))dx′

! ,

where S12 and S21 are the oﬀ-diagonal entries of the matrix S and the choice of the
domain of integration is determined by the sign of the real part of the exponent.
This eventually gives

where both exponential terms are less than one in modulus. If R is summable and

bT (x) =

means that the transformation eﬀectively eliminates the oﬀ-diagonal terms of V .

and z ∈ [1, Z2(ε)] with Z2(ε) given by (7.14) the matrix bTII (z, ε) given by (7.22)

(7.23)

Proof. Let us choose the point tI−II so close to t0 that for every z ∈ [0, Z2(ε)] it
holds that ε

Lemma 7.8. Let the conditions of Lemma 7.2 hold, Z1(ε) be given by (7.25) and
Z2(ε) by (7.14) with tI−II given by (7.24). If

where the vectors e± are given by (1.21) and the remainder o(1) converges uniformly
with respect to z ∈ [Z1(ε), Z2(ε)].
Proof. First let us eliminate the oﬀ-diagonal entries of the matrix VII (z, ε) with
the Harris–Lutz transformation

(7.54)

uII,2(z) = (I + bTII (z, ε))uII,7(z)

where bTII is given by (7.22). On the one hand, in contrast with the interval

[Z0, Z1(ε)], the transformation depends on ε, because one cannot ignore the dif-
ference between VII (z, ε) and VII (z, 0) anymore. On the other hand, we do not
need to prove convergence to solutions of some other system independent of ε (it is
no longer true that there is convergence to solutions of (7.15)). With the substitu-
tion (7.54) we come to the system

(7.55)

u′II,7(z) = (ΛII,7(z, ε) + RII,7(z, ε))uII,7(z),

where, according to (7.9), (7.12) and (7.20),

we get:

Since 1 − κ = 1−γ

considered, if ε is small enough. Hence Lemma 7.7 yields for both (7.63) and (7.62):

and they are solutions of the system (7.7). Lemma 7.5, expressions (7.57) and
convergence in (7.65) imply that these solutions have asymptotics (7.53). This
completes the proof.

Z1(ε) kRII,7(s, ε)kds → 0

The following trivial lemma helps to match the results in diﬀerent intervals.

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

Lemma 7.9. Let g(ε), f+(ε), f−(ε) be functions of ε deﬁned in some neighbourhood
of the point ε = 0 with values in C2 and such that g(ε) → g, f±(ε) → f+ as
ε → 0, where the vectors f+ and f− are linearly independent and g = c+f+ + c−f−.
Then in the decomposition g(ε) = c+(ε)f+(ε)+c−(ε)f−(ε) the coeﬃcients converge:
c±(ε) → c± as ε → 0.
Proof. Consider scalar products with the vectors orthogonal to f± to immediately
see the result.

Combining the results of Lemmas 7.6 and 7.8 we can now prove Lemma 7.2.

On the ﬁrst part [−Z1(ε),−Z0] of the region IV we treat the system (8.7) as a

In the same way as in the region II due to Lemma 8.4 and the choice of Z1(ε) = 1

one has:

−Z1(ε) keRIV,2(s, ε)kds → 0 as ε → 0+.

Now we can obtain results for the subintervals [−Z1(ε),−Z0] and [−Z2(ε),−Z1(ε)].
Lemma 8.6. Let the conditions of Lemma 8.2 hold and let Z1(ε) be given by (7.25).

Let us now introduce two solutions u±IV,8 of this system which satisfy the following
equations:

They can be rewritten as

For these equalities Lemma 7.7 yields:

eiE2(s,ε)RIV,7(s, ε)e−iE2(s,ε)e±ds

eiE2(s,ε)RIV,7(s, ε)e−iE2(s,ε)(u±IV,8(s, ε) − e±)ds.

−Z2(ε) kRIV,7(s, ε)kds → 0
Λ±IV,7(σ, ε)dσ! u±IV,8(z, ε)

which are solutions of the system (8.6). Lemma 8.5, the expression (8.41) and
convergence in (8.47) imply that these solutions have asymptotics (8.38). This
completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Combining the results of Lemmas 8.6 and 8.7 we now come to the proof of

Lemma 8.2.

due to the choice of Z1(ε) in (7.25). Let us deﬁne for z ∈ [−Z2(ε),−Z1(ε)]

(8.48)

u±IV,2(z, ε) := a±IV exp −Z −Z0

Continuations of the solutionsbu±IV,2(z, ε) to the interval [−Z1(ε),−Z0] have decom-

By Lemma 7.9 we conclude that for z ∈ [−Z1(ε),−Z0]

exp(cid:16)R −Z0
bu±IV,2(z, ε) = (1 + o(1))eu±IV,2(z, ε))

bu±IV,2(−Z1(ε), ε) = e± + o(1),

For every ﬁxed z ≤ −Z0 this means that

Asymptotics of u±IV,2(z, ε) at z = −Z2(ε) are due to Lemma 8.7.

The main term of its coeﬃcient matrix is analytic near the turning point t0 = (2β)
and degenerates as a matrix at t0. Analytic theory for the case RIII ≡ 0 is well
known (see, for example, [35, Chapter VIII]). It suggests the transformation

The problem comes from the remainder RIII,1 which is by no means analytic (we
know that it wildly oscillates), but is small in the integral sense. Analytic theory
would proceed with making the change of the variable τ (t) ∼ const · (t − t0) as
t → t0 and considering

ua(τ ) = P (τ, ε)uIII,1(t(τ ))

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

with the matrix-valued function P analytic in both variables such that the system
(9.4) is transformed into

this system can be further transformed into

Solutions of the latter are expressed in terms of Airy functions: the system has the
following matrix solution:

Ua,1(ζ) =(cid:18) Ai(ζ) Bi(ζ)
Ai′(ζ) Bi′(ζ) (cid:19) .

In our case, due to presence of the remainder RIII,1, such transformations are not
possible. Instead, in this section we show that in the scale of the variable z which
was used in the regions II and IV , on any ﬁxed interval [−z0, z0], the presence of
the remainder RIII does not aﬀect the asymptotics of solutions of the system (9.1).
In terms of the variable t the interval [−Z0, Z0] of the region III corresponds to
the interval [tII−III (ε), tIII−IV (ε)] which shrinks to the turning point t0. Analytic
method of [35] gives the result for a ﬁxed neighbourhood of the turning point in the
scale of the variable t, the result which we do not have here. However, we already
know what happens in the regions II and IV .

Let consider the variable z =

The following lemma is the main result for the region III.

Lemma 9.1. Let c0, z0 > 0 and RIII,2(z, ε) is given by (9.8), (9.5) and (9.3). If

then the system (9.7) has the matrix solution UIII,2(z, ε) such that for every z ∈

First let us estimate the remainder in the system (9.7).

Lemma 9.2. Under the conditions of Lemma 9.1, if

Z z0
−z0 kRIII (t(s, ε), ε)kds = o(cid:16)ε

2

3(cid:17) , then Z z0

−z0 kRIII,2(s, ε)kds → 0

as ε → 0+.
Proof. From the expression (9.8) one immediately has: there exists c29 > 0 such
that for every suﬃciently small ε and every z ∈ [−z0, z0]

Furthermore, due to (9.5), boundedness and bounded invertibility of TIII in the
neighbourhood of the point t0, one has:

2

kRIII,2(z, ε)k ≤ c29(cid:16)ε
kRIII,2(z, ε)k ≤ c30(cid:16)ε

with some c30 > 0, which converges to zero as ε → 0+.

(cid:3)

Now let us see that conditions of Lemma 9.1 are satisﬁed, if RIII = R+
2 .

Lemma 9.3. Let z0 > 0, let R+
and conditions (4.3) and (4.2) hold. Then

We need the following technical lemma, which is simple and standard.

Lemma 9.4. Let A(x, ε) be a n × n matrix-valued function deﬁned for x ∈ [a, b]
and ε from some neighbourhood of zero. Let A(·, ε) ∈ L1((a, b), M n×n(C)) for
every ε and A(x, ε) → A(x, 0) in the norm of L1((a, b), M n×n(C)). If U (x) is a
non-degenerate matrix solution of the system

(9.11)

u′(x) = A(x, ε)u(x),

for ε = 0, then there exist non-degenerate solutions U (x, ε) of this system for all
ε 6= 0 such that U (x, ε) → U (x) as ε → 0 uniformly in x ∈ [a, b].
Proof. Let us look for U (x, ε) = U (x)Y (x, ε). The system (9.11) is equivalent to

Y ′(x) = U−1(x)(A(x, ε) − A(x, 0))U (x)Y (x).
Function U is bounded on the interval [a, b] and its determinant,
det U (x) = det U (a) exp(cid:18)Z x
tr A(t, 0)dt(cid:19) ,

a

is separated from zero, since A(·, 0) ∈ L1((a, b), M n×n(C)). Therefore the function
U−1 is also bounded on [a, b]. Take Y as the solution of the following Volterra
equation:

U−1(t)(A(t, ε) − A(t, 0))U (t)Y (t, ε)dt.

Y (x, ε) = I +Z x
KIII (ε) : Y (x) 7→Z x

Repeating the standard argument on inverting I − KIII (ε) where

U−1(t)(A(t, ε) − A(t, 0))U (t)Y (t, ε)dt

is a Volterra operator in the space L∞((a, b), M n×n(C)) and estimating the norm
of the inverse, we ﬁnally come to the estimate

and

sup

x∈[a,b]kY (x, ε) − Ik ≤ kKIII (ε)kB(L∞(a,b)) exp(kKIII (ε)kB(L∞(a,b)))
kKIII(ε)kB(L∞(a,b)) ≤Z b

a kU−1(t)(A(t, ε) − A(t, 0))U (t)kdt → 0

as ε → 0+. From this the statement of the lemma follows.

Now we are ready to prove Lemma 9.1.

Proof of Lemma 9.1. Due to Lemmas 9.4 and 9.2, we only need to check that the

10. Matching of the results in regions

In this section we prove Theorem 4.1 by putting together results of the previous

ﬁve sections considering RII = RIII = RIV = RV = R+
2 .

For the regions II, III and IV let us, according to Lemmas 7.2, 8.2 and 9.1,
deﬁne solutions u±II , u±IV and UIII (matrix-valued) of the system (4.12) in the
following way :

(10.1)

(10.2)

and

(10.3)

u±II(t, ε) := TII (t)u±II,2(z(t, ε), ε),

u±IV (t, ε) := TIV (t)u±IV,2(z(t, ε), ε)

UIII(t, ε) := TIII (t)(cid:18) 2

0 −ε

3 (cid:19) UIII,2(z(t, ε), ε)

with TII , TIII and TIV given by (7.2), (9.3) and (8.2). These all are solutions of
the same system and hence are linearly dependent with coeﬃcients which depend
on ε. By matching we mean ﬁnding asymptotic behaviour of these coeﬃcients as
ε → 0+. The following lemma matches solutions in the regions II and IV using
the results for the region III.
Lemma 10.1. Let solutions u±II (t, ε) and u±IV (t, ε) of the system (4.12) be deﬁned
by (10.1) and (10.2). One has:

u+

2√2

i
√2

with some αm ∈ C and δ1(ε), δ2(ε), δ3(ε), δ4(ε) → 0 as ε → 0+.
Proof. Linear dependence of solutions can be written in the following form:

u±II (t, ε) = UIII (t, ε)ξ±II (ε),
u±IV (t, ε) = UIII (t, ε)ξ±IV (ε)

with some vector coeﬃcients ξ±II (ε) and ξ±IV (ε), and also in the following form:

+(ε)u+
u+
II (t, ε) = d+
u−II (t, ε) = d−+(ε)u+

IV (t, ε) + d+
IV (t, ε) + d−

−(ε)u−IV (t, ε)

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

with some coeﬃcients d+

coeﬃcients should be related as

ξ−II (ε) = d−+(ε)ξ+

IV (ε) + d+
IV (ε) + d−

−(ε)ξ−IV (ε),
−(ε)ξ−IV (ε).

This can be rewritten in matrix notation as CII (ε) = CIV (ε)D(ε), where

CII :=(cid:0)ξ+

II|ξ−II(cid:1) , CIV :=(cid:0)ξ+

IV |ξ−IV(cid:1) , D :=(cid:18) d+

Therefore if we know ξ±II and ξ±IV , we can calculate d+
D(ε) = CIV (ε)−1CII (ε).

From the expressions (10.1), (10.2) and (10.3) we can write for any solutions uII,2,
uIV,2 and uIII,2 of the systems (7.8), (8.7) and (9.7):

the relations (10.14) and (10.15) together with the facts that λIV = λV are purely

On the one hand, from (10.18), the equalities λI = λII , SI = SII , SIV = SV and
ﬁniteness of the limit in (10.17), we have

On the other hand, from the asymptotics (10.12)

(10.20)

u±I−II (tI−II , ε) → TI(tI−II )e± as ε → 0+.

From this we will now estimate the growth of the norm of the fundamental solution.
Deﬁne for every h ∈ C2 the solution uI−II (t, ε, h) of the system (4.12) on the interval
[tI−II , +∞) with the initial condition

uI−II(tI−II , ε, h) = TI−II(tI−II )h.

The fundamental solution F of the system (4.12) can be written as follows:

F (t, tI−II , ε) = (uI−II(t, ε, e+)|uI−II(t, ε, e−)) T −1

I

(tI−II ),

therefore its norm can be estimated by the norms of solutions uI−II(t, ε, e±). For
them we have from (10.20) by Lemma 7.9:
uI−II (t, ε, e+) = (1 + δ17(ε))u+
uI−II (t, ε, e−) = δ19(ε)u+

I−II (t, ε) + δ18(ε)u−I−II(t, ε),
I−II(t, ε) + (1 + δ20(ε))u−I−II (t, ε)

with some δ17(ε), δ18(ε), δ19(ε), δ20(ε) → 0 as ε → 0+. Therefore (10.19) means
that

t→+∞ kF (t, tI−II, ε)k = o(cid:18)exp(cid:18)Z t0

If one proves that the asymptotics as ε → 0+ of the solution

in the region I, namely at the point tI−II , coincides with the asymptotics of the
solution u+
2 (t, ε, f ) at the same point (which is given by Lemma 5.1), then the rest
follows automatically. This is because Lemmas 6.1, 7.2, 8.2 and 9.1 are directly
applicable to the system (10.21) and the matching procedure (or estimating, in

the case f = f−) works for the solution(cid:18) 1

0 −1 (cid:19) u−2 literally as above. Hence

the asymptotic behaviour of the norm is the same. In the argument of Section 5
every estimate and convergence remain the same as for the case of u+
2 , except the
calculation (5.21). In an analogue of that calculation one ﬁnally arrives at

11. Proof of the main result

In this section we prove Theorem 1.1 putting together everything that was ob-

tained in the previous sections.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Consider the critical point νcr and let α 6= αcr. By Lemma
3.1 there exists the neighbourhood Ucr, and there the eigenfunction equation for
the operator Lα is equivalent to the system

Rewrite this system as

sin(εcr(λ)x)

w′cr(x) =(cid:18) βcr
u′(x) =(cid:18) βcr

xγ (cid:18) cos(εcr(λ)x)
sin(εcr(λ)x) − cos(εcr(λ)x) (cid:19) + Rcr(x, λ)(cid:19) wcr(x).
xγ (cid:18) cos(ε0x)
sin(ε0x) − cos(ε0x) (cid:19) + Rcr(x, λ(ε0))(cid:19) u(x)

sin(ε0x)

with λ(ε0) = ε−1
cr (ε0), which means that λ is parametrised by ε0 so that εcr(λ) = ε0.
Properties of the remainder provided by Lemma 3.1 are such that the conditions

ZEROES OF THE SPECTRAL DENSITY

(4.2) and (4.3) are satisﬁed. By Lemma 4.1 there exists fcr− ∈ C2\{0} such that
the solution ucr(x, 0, f ) has the asymptotics
βcrx1−γ

ucr(x, 0, fcr−) = exp(cid:18)−
ucr(x, 0, f ) = exp(cid:18) βcrx1−γ

1 − γ (cid:19) (Φcr(f )e+ + o(1)) as x → +∞.

and for f ∦ fcr−

In fact, the matrix Rcr has real entries, so fcr− ∈ R2\{0}. Moreover, comparing
these asymptotics with (3.4) and (3.5) provided by Lemma 3.1, we see that

and

fcr− =

gcr,αcr
dcr−

(11.1)
Since α 6= αcr, the vectors gcr,α and fcr− are linearly independent and so, by
Lemma 7.9,

Φcr(fcr,α) = dcr+ sin(α − αcr).

wcr,α(0, λ(ε0)) = (1 + δ21(ε0))gcr,α + δ22(ε0)fcr−

with some δ21(ε), δ22(ε) → 0 as ε → 0. Therefore
(11.2)

wcr,α(x, λ(ε0)) = (1 + δ21(ε0))u(x, ε0, gcr,α) + δ22(ε0)u(x, ε0, fcr−).

By Theorem 4.1 using the relation (11.1) we have

at the asymptotics (1.18) with ccr given by (1.19). This completes the proof. (cid:3)
