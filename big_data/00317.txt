Abstract. The purpose of this work is to study a ﬁnite element method for ﬁnding solutions
to the eigenvalue problem for the fractional Laplacian. We prove that the discrete eigenvalue
problem converges to the continuous one and we show the order of such convergence. Finally,
we perform some numerical experiments and compare our results with previous work by other

1. Introduction and Main Results

Anomalous diﬀusion phenomena are ubiquitous in nature [22, 29], and the study of nonlocal
operators has been an active area of research in diﬀerent branches of mathematics. Such op-
erators arise in applications as image processing [6, 17, 18, 27], ﬁnance [7, 10], electromagnetic
ﬂuids [28], peridynamics [37], porous media ﬂow [2, 11], among others.

One striking example of a nonlocal operator is the fractional Laplacian (−∆)s, deﬁned by

(−∆)su(x) := 2C(n, s)ˆRn

u(x) − u(y)
|x − y|n+2s dy,

x ∈ Rn.

Here the integral is understood in the principal value sense and the normalization constant
C(n, s) is given by

C(n, s) :=

22s−1sΓ(s + n
2 )
πn/2Γ(1 − s)

.

In the theory of stochastic processes, this operator appears as the inﬁnitesimal generator of a
stable L´evy process, see for instance [3, 38]. Moreover, the fractional Laplacian is also one of
the simplest examples of a pseudo-diﬀerential operator, because its symbol is just P (ξ) = |ξ|2s.
An interesting problem concerning the fractional Laplacian is to ﬁnd its eigenvalues on
bounded domains. Namely, to ﬁnd a positive number λ (eigenvalue) and a function u 6≡ 0
(eigenfunction) such that

(1.1)

((−∆)su = λu

u = 0

in Ω,
in Ωc = Rn \ Ω,

where Ω is a bounded smooth domain in Rn and s ∈ (0, 1). Observe that, due to the fact that
pointwise values of (−∆)su depend on the value of u over the whole space, the “boundary”
conditions need to be imposed on the complement of Ω.

Even if Ω is an interval, it is very challenging to obtain closed analytical expressions for
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fractional Laplacian. This motivates the utilization of
discrete approximations of this problem (see, for example, [13, 24, 39]); in this work we consider a
ﬁnite element method. In ﬁrst place, we prove that the discrete eigenvalue problem converges to
the continuous one. Then, we show the order of convergence for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,
both in the energy and the L2-norm. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments and
compare our results with previous work by other authors. These results are in good agreement
with our theory.

The ﬁnite element method is ﬂexible enough to deal with non-convex domains, and enables
us to provide estimates and sharp upper bounds for eigenvalues even in this context. Moreover,
as a consequence of our numerical experiments in the L-shaped domain Ω = [−1, 1]2 \ [0, 1]2,
we conjecture that the ﬁrst eigenfunction for this domain is as regular as the ﬁrst one in any
smooth domain.

Main Results. In order to state our results we need some notations and deﬁnitions. The
natural functional space for the eigenvalue problem (1.1) is

where H s(Rn) is the space of all functions u ∈ L2(Rn) such that

eH s(Ω) :=(cid:8)v ∈ H s(Rn) : supp v ⊂ ¯Ω(cid:9) ,
|v(x) − v(y)|2
H s(Rn) := ¨R2n
|v|2
|x − y|n+2s dx dy < ∞.

hu, vi := C(n, s)¨R2n

Moreover, (V,k · kV) :=(cid:16)eH s(Ω),pC(n, s)| · |H s(Rn)(cid:17) is a Hilbert space with the inner product
Obviously, the constant pC(n, s) has no eﬀect on the deﬁnition of the space; it is included in
order to make the notation simpler in the rest of the paper. The fractional space H s(Rn) can
also be deﬁned for any s > 1. If s = m + σ, where m ∈ N and σ ∈ (0, 1), H s(Rn) is the space
of all functions v ∈ H m(Rm) such that its weak derivatives of order m belong to H σ(Rn). For
more details, see Section 2.

(u(x) − u(y))(v(x) − v(y))

|x − y|n+2s

dx dy.

In this context, the eigenvalue problem (1.1) has the following variational formulation: ﬁnd

λ ∈ (0, +∞) and u ∈ V such that u 6≡ 0 and
(1.2)
where (·,·) : L2(Ω) × L2(Ω) → R is the bilinear form

hu, vi = λ(u, v)

for all v ∈ V,

(u, v) := ˆΩ

u(x)v(x) dx.

In [34], the authors show that there is an inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues {λ(k)}k∈N,

0 < λ(1) < λ(2) ≤ ··· ≤ λ(k) ≤ ··· ,

λ(k) → ∞ as k → ∞,

where the same eigenvalue can be repeated several times according to its multiplicity. The
corresponding eigenfunctions u(k) (normalized by ku(k)kL2(Ω) = 1) form a complete orthonormal
set in L2(Ω). See also [33, 35, 36] and the references therein for further details on the fractional
eigenvalue problem.

Let us now introduce the discrete space. Let Th be a family of triangulations of Ω satisfying

(Regularity)
for any element T ∈ Th, where hT is the diameter of T and ρT is the radius of the largest ball
contained in T . This is the only requirement we need to impose to our family of triangulations.

∃σ > 0 s.t. hT ≤ σρT ,

We consider continuous piecewise linear functions on Th, namely

Vh :=(cid:8)v ∈ V : v(cid:12)(cid:12)T ∈ P1(T ) ∀T ∈ Th(cid:9) .

Our Galerkin approximation consists in looking for discrete eigenvalues λh ∈ R and uh ∈ Vh

such that uh 6≡ 0 and
(1.3)

We can order the discrete eigenvalues of (1.3) as follows

huh, vi = λh(uh, v) ∀v ∈ Vh.

0 < λ(1)

h ≤ λ(2)

h ≤ ··· ≤ λ(k)

h ≤ ··· ≤ λ(dimVh)

h

,

where the same eigenvalue is repeated according to its multiplicity. The corresponding eigen-
functions u(k)
h

h kL2(Ω) = 1) form an orthonormal set in L2(Ω).

(normalized by ku(k)

The purpose of this work is to prove the convergence of this discrete problem to the continuous
one. To this end, we provide a Sobolev regularity result. Namely, using the regularity results of
Grubb [19] and a bootstrap argument, we prove
Proposition 1.1. Let u be an eigenfunction of (−∆)s in Ω with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Then, u ∈ eH s+1/2−ε(Ω) for any ε > 0.

Another important tool is given by considering approximation properties of Πh : V → Vh, the

projection with respect to the k · kV norm. To be speciﬁc,
Proposition 1.2. Let u be an eigenfunction of (1.2). Then, for any ε > 0 there exists a positive
constant C independent of h such that

(1.4)

and

(1.5)

ku − ΠhukV ≤ Ch1/2−ε|u|H s+1/2−ε(Ω),

ku − ΠhukL2(Ω) ≤ Ch1/2+α−ε|u|H s+1/2−ε(Ω).

Here, α = s if s < 1/2 and α = 1/2 − ε if s ≥ 1/2.

Our ﬁrst result concerning the convergence is to determine it in a “gap” distance, that is, we
prove that the discrete eigenvalue problem (1.3) converges to the continuous one (1.2), following
the deﬁnition of convergence given in [21, 5] (see also [4]). More precisely, we deﬁne the gap
between Hilbert spaces E, F ⊂ H by
inf
v∈F ku − vkH ,

ˆδ(E, F ) = max(δ(E, F ), δ(F, E)).

δ(E, F ) =

sup

u∈E,kukH =1

Then, taking H = V, we say that the discrete eigenvalue problem (1.3) converges to the contin-
uous one (1.2) if, for any ε > 0 and k > 0, there is h0 > 0 such that

respectively.

Theorem 1.3. The discrete eigenvalue problem (1.3) converges to the continuous one (1.2).

Having established the convergence of the discrete problem to the continuous one, we aim to
study the order of such convergence. Our procedure is in the same spirit as in [4], and we prove
the following results

Theorem 1.4. Let (u(k), λ(k)) be an eigenpair of multiplicity one. For any ε > 0, there is a
positive constant C independent of h such that

ku(k) − u(k)

h kL2(Ω) ≤ Chα+1/2−ε,

0 ≤ λ(k)

h − λ(k) ≤ Ch1−ε,

and

ku(k) − u(k)

h kV ≤ Ch1/2−ε.

Here u(k)
h

is chosen in such a way that (cid:16)Πhu(k), u(k)

h (cid:17) ≥ 0 and α is given by Proposition 1.2.
Theorem 1.5. Let λ(k) be an eigenvalue of multiplicity m (that is, λ(k) = λ(k+1) = ··· =
λ(k+m−1) and λ(i) 6= λ(k) for i 6= k, . . . , k + m − 1). For any ε > 0, there exists a positive
constant C independent of h such that

0 ≤ λ(j)

h − λ(k) ≤ Ch1−ε ∀k ≤ j ≤ k + m − 1.

Moreover, if u(k) is an eigenfunction associated to λ(k), there is
h ⊕ . . . ⊕ E(k+m−1)

h } ⊂ E(k)

{w(k)

h

such that

and

ku(k) − w(k)

h kL2(Ω) ≤ Chα+1/2−ε

ku(k) − w(k)

h kV ≤ Ch1/2−ε,

where α is given by Proposition 1.2.

Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 and Theorem 1.3 are the key ingredients in the proof of the above

two theorems.

Let us mention at this point that in [4], where the author studies the eigenvalue problem
for the laplacian, the order of convergence of the eigenvalues is proved in ﬁrst place, by using
the min-max formulation and estimate (1.4).
If we followed the sketch of this proof for the
fractional laplacian case we would obtain order 1/2 + s when s < 1/2, which is less than 1. So, in
order to obtain the optimal order we need to prove ﬁrst the convergence of the eigenvalues and
afterwards the order of convergence of the eigenfunctions. In this manner, using both results
and estimate (1.4), we obtain optimal order for the eigenvalues for any 0 < s < 1.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 collects the notation we employ, and reviews
some previous works on the problem under consideration.
In particular, regularity of eigen-
functions is proved. The section concludes with a discussion of certain aspects of ﬁnite element
approximations of the fractional Laplacian. Afterwards, Section 3 deals with the convergence
of the discrete eigenvalue problem to the continuous one in gap distance.
In Sections 4 and
5 the study of the order of convergence is developed, ﬁrst for simple eigenvalues and later for
eigenspaces of dimension greater than one. Finally, numerical experiments are discussed in
Section 6.

2. Preliminaries and Definitions

In this section we review the basic aspects of the problem under consideration. In ﬁrst place,
we set notation regarding Sobolev spaces. Afterwards, we analyze theoretical properties of the
eigenvalue problem (1.1). Regularity results for weak solutions of fractional Laplace equations
are recalled next. The section concludes with the introduction of the ﬁnite element spaces we
work with.
2.1. Sobolev spaces. Given an open set Ω ⊂ Rn and s ∈ (0, 1), deﬁne the fractional Sobolev
space H s(Ω) as

H s(Ω) :=(cid:8)v ∈ L2(Ω) : |v|H s(Ω) < ∞(cid:9) ,
where | · |H s(Ω) is the seminorm
|v(x) − v(y)|2
H s(Ω) := ¨Ω2
|v|2
|x − y|n+2s dx dy.

Obviously, H s(Ω) is a Hilbert space endowed with the norm k · kH s(Ω) = k · kL2(Ω) + | · |H s(Ω). If
s > 1 and it is not an integer, the decomposition s = m + σ, where m ∈ N and σ ∈ (0, 1), allows
to deﬁne H s(Ω) by setting

H s(Ω) :=(cid:8)v ∈ H m(Ω) : |Dαv|H σ(Ω) < ∞ for all α s.t |α| = m(cid:9) .

Let us also deﬁne the space of functions supported in Ω,

For 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, this space may be deﬁned through interpolation,

eH s(Ω) :=(cid:8)v ∈ H s(Rn) : supp v ⊂ ¯Ω(cid:9) .

eH s(Ω) =(cid:2)L2(Ω), H 1

0 (Ω)(cid:3)s .

Moreover, depending on the value of s, diﬀerent characterizations of this space are available

(see, for example [26, Chapter 11]). If s < 1/2 the space eH s(Ω) coincides with H s(Ω), and if

0 (Ω) with respect to the | · |H s(Ω) norm. In
0(Ω). The particular case of s = 1/2 gives

It is apparent that h·,·i deﬁnes an inner product on eH s(Ω). In addition, the norm induced

by it, which is just the H s(Rn) seminorm, is equivalent to the full H s(Rn) norm on this space,
because of the following well known result.

Proposition 2.1 (Poincar´e inequality). There is a constant c = c(Ω, n, s) such that

In [34], the authors prove that for any k ∈ N the eigenvalues of (1.2) can be characterized as

follows:

where V(1) = V and

V(k) :=nu ∈ V : Du, u(j)E = 0 ∀j = 1, . . . , k − 1o

for all k ≥ 2. Therefore, by the min-max theorem,

λ(k) = min

where S(k) denotes the set of all k−dimensional subspaces of V.
In [34], the authors show that λ(1) is simple, see also [12, 25]. Whereas in [16] it is proved
that u(k) ∈ L∞(Ω) for all k ∈ N. Therefore, by [30, Proposition 1.1], u(k) ∈ C s(Rn) for all k ∈ N.
2.3. Regularity results. Given a function f ∈ H r(Ω) (r ≥ −s), let us consider the homoge-
neous Dirichlet problem for the fractional Laplacian,

(2.2)

((−∆)su = f

u = 0

in Ω,
in Ωc.

Existence and uniqueness of a weak solution u ∈ eH s(Ω) of the above equation is an immediate

consequence of the Lax-Milgram lemma. Following Grubb [19], it is possible to obtain Sobolev
regularity results for the solution. In that paper, the author deals with H¨ormander µ−spaces
H µ(s)
; see that work for a deﬁnition and further details. The following result is a particular case
of Theorem 7.1 therein:

p

Theorem 2.2. Let ℓ > s− 1/2 and assume u ∈ eH σ(Ω) for some σ > s− 1/2 and consider a right
hand side function f ∈ H ℓ−2s(Ω). Then, it holds that u ∈ H s(ℓ)(Ω).

In particular, considering ℓ = r + 2s in the previous theorem and taking into account that

H s(r+2s)(Ω)(= eH 2s+r(Ω)

⊂ eH s+1/2−ε(Ω) ∀ε > 0,

(see [19, Theorem 5.4]), we obtain the following:

if 0 < s + r < 1/2,
if 1/2 ≤ s + r < 1,

FE APPROXIMATION FOR THE FRACTIONAL EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

Proposition 2.3. Let f ∈ H r(Ω) for r ≥ −s and u ∈ eH s(Ω) be the solution of the Dirichlet

problem (2.2). Then, the following regularity estimate holds

|u|H s+α(Rn) ≤ C(n, α)kfkH r (Ω).

Here, α = s + r if s + r < 1/2 and α = 1/2 − ε if s + r ≥ 1/2, with ε > 0 arbitrarily small.
Remark 2.4. Assuming further Sobolev regularity in the right hand side function does not imply
that the solution will be any smoother than what is given by the previous proposition. Indeed,
if f ∈ H r(Ω), then Theorem 2.2 gives u ∈ H s(r+2s)(Ω), which can not be embedded in any space
sharper than H s+1/2−ε(Ω) if r + s ≥ 1/2.

Moreover, regularity estimates for eigenfunctions of the fractional Laplacian are derived in
[20, 31]. These estimates are formulated in terms of H¨older norms. Letting d be a smooth
function that behaves like dist(x, ∂Ω) near the boundary of Ω, it is shown that any eigenfunction
u of (1.1) lies in the space dsC 2s(−ε)(Ω), where the ε is active only if s = 1/2 and that u/ds does
not vanish near ∂Ω. This shows that no further regularity than H s+1/2−ε(Ω) should be expected
for eigenfunctions.

Sobolev regularity of eigenfunctions is a consequence of Proposition 2.3.

Proof of Proposition 1.1. Since f = λu ∈ H s(Ω) the case s ≥ 1/4 is a direct consequence of
Proposition 2.3. When s < 1/4 the result follows using a bootstrap argument.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.5. As in Grubb’s work the domain Ω is required to be smooth, we assumed that
hypothesis in the two previous propositions. However, numerical evidence indicates that this
assumption is not necessary (see Subsection 6.2). Observe that the theory of Section 3 does
not necessitate the smoothness of Ω, and that in sections 4 and 5 it is only required in order to
apply Theorem 2.2.

2.4. Finite element approximations. Let Th be a family of shape-regular triangulations of Ω
(see introduction). Observe that for all h > 0 the discrete space Vh is a subset of the continuous
one.

We have the analogous min-max characterization for eigenvalues of the discrete problem,

h = min

where S(k)

h denotes the set of all k dimensional subspaces of Vh.

Remark 2.6. It follows from Vh ⊂ V that

λ(k) ≤ λ(k)
h .

In the remainder of this section, we analyze approximation properties of ﬁnite element spaces.
Consider a quasi-interpolation operator Ih : H l(Ω) → Vh satisfying the following estimate: there
exists C > 0 such that for any w ∈ H l(Ω),
(2.3)

kw − IhwkV ≤ Chl−s|w|H l(Ω).

Quasi-interpolation operators were introduced in [9] (see also [32]), and an estimate like (2.3) is
derived, for example, in [1].

8

Given u ∈ V, recall that by Πhu we denote the projection with respect to the k · kV norm.

Clearly, this is the only function in Vh such that the Galerkin orthogonality

holds, or equivalently,

(2.4)

hu − Πhu, vhi = 0 ∀vh ∈ Vh

ku − ΠhukV = inf

vh∈Vh ku − vhkV.

Observe that if u is the solution of (2.2), then Πhu corresponds to the solution of the corre-
sponding discrete problem on Vh.

Now, we can prove our estimates for the error.

Proof of Proposition 1.2. The ﬁrst inequality follows by combining estimate (2.4), interpolation
inequality (2.3) and Proposition 1.1.

The second one follows from the following Aubin–Nitsche argument. Let w ∈ V be the weak

solution of the boundary value problem

((−∆)sw = u − Πhu

w = 0

in Ω,
in Ωc.

Then, resorting to Galerkin orthogonality again we obtain

ku − Πhuk2

L2(Ω) = hw, u − Πhui ≤ kw − IhwkVku − ΠhukV,

where Ihw ∈ Vh is the interpolator of w.

Taking into account the regularity given by Proposition 2.3 with r = 0, interpolation estimate

(2.3) gives

Finally, using the error estimate (1.4) we obtain

kw − IhwkV ≤ Chα|w|H s+α(Ω) ≤ Chαku − ΠhukL2(Ω).

(2.5)

ku − Πhuk2
and then estimate (1.5) follows.

L2(Ω) ≤ Ch1/2+α−ε|u|H s+1/2−ε(Ω)ku − ΠhukL2(Ω),

(cid:3)

3. Convergence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in gap distance

In this section we prove Theorem 1.3, stating that the discrete eigenvalue problem (1.3)
converges to the continuous one (1.2) in the gap distance (recall the deﬁnition of convergence
given in the introduction). Let us start by deﬁning the solution operators of the continuous and
discrete problems, T : L2(Ω) → V and Th : L2(Ω) → Vh. Given f ∈ L2(Ω), we deﬁne T f ∈ V as
the unique solution of

(3.1)
and Thf ∈ Vh as the unique solution of

hT f, vi = (f, v) ∀v ∈ V,

hThf, vhi = (f, vh) ∀vh ∈ Vh.

Observe that if (u, λ) is an eigenpair, then T (λu) = u and Th(λu) = Πhu.

To prove Theorem 1.3, by [4, Proposition 7.4 and Remark 7.5], we only need to show that

the operators T and Th are compact and

kT − ThkL(L2(Ω),V) → 0 as h → 0.

FE APPROXIMATION FOR THE FRACTIONAL EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

Lemma 3.1. The operators T and Th are compact.
Proof. Let {fk}k∈N be a bounded sequence in L2(Ω). Then, there exists a subsequence of {fk}k∈N
(still denoted by {fk}) and f ∈ L2(Ω) such that fk ⇀ f weakly in L2(Ω). Taking v = T fk in
(3.1), we get

kT fkk2

V = (fk, T fk) ≤ CkT fkkL2(Ω) ∀k ∈ N.

Therefore, by Poincar´e inequality (2.1), we have that {T fk}k∈N is bounded in V. Thus, there
exists a subsequence of {fk}k∈N (still denoted by {fk}k∈N) and u ∈ V such that T fk ⇀ u weakly
in V. Hence

hu, vi = lim

k→∞hT fk, vi = lim

k→∞

(fk, v) = (f, v) ∀v ∈ V,

that is, u = T f.

On the other hand, since the inclusion V ֒→ L2(Rn) is compact, passing if necessary to a

subsequence we may assume

Then,

T fk ⇀ T f weakly in V,
T fk → T f strongly in L2(Rn).
V = (fk, T fk) → (f, T f ) = kT fk2

V

kT fkk2

as n → ∞. Since the space V is uniformly convex, it follows that

T fk → T f strongly in V.

The proof for the operator Th is similar.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. The following norm convergence holds true:

kT − ThkL(L2(Ω),V) → 0 as h → 0.
Proof. For each h, take fh ∈ L2(Ω) such that kfhkL2(Ω) = 1 and

sup

kf kL2 (Ω)=1 kT f − ThfkV = kT fh − ThfhkV.

Then, to prove the result, it is enough to show that for any sequence hk → 0 there is a

subsequence {hkj}j∈N such that

kT fhkj − Thkj

fhkjkV → 0

as j → ∞.

Let {hk}k∈N be a sequence sucht that hk → 0. It follows from kfhkkL2(Ω) = 1 for all k ∈ N
that there exist a subsequence {fhkj}j∈N of {fhk}k∈N and f ∈ L2(Ω) such that fhkj
⇀ f weakly
in L2(Ω). Proceeding as in the proof of Lemma 3.1 (and passing if necessary to a subsequence),
we may assume

Thkj
Thkj

⇀ v weakly in V,

fhkj
fhkj → v strongly in L2(Rn).

On the other hand, it follows from (2.3) that

Ihϕ → ϕ strongly in V,
Ihϕ → ϕ strongly in L2(Rn),

10

for any ϕ ∈ C ∞

0 (Ω). Therefore,

hv, ϕi = lim

which means that v = T f . Then,

(cid:3)

Now we conclude the convergence of the discrete eigenvalue problem to the continuous one in

Proof of Theorem 1.3. The proof follows by Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 and using Proposition 7.4 and

4. Order of convergence: simple eigenfunctions

In this section we assume that λ(k) is an eigenvalue of multiplicity one; in the next section we

extend the discussion in order to tackle the case of multiple eigenfunctions.

In order to simplify, we split the proof of Theorem 1.4 into three lemmas. We ﬁrst estimate

the rate of convergence of u(k)
h

towards u(k) in the L2-norm.

Lemma 4.1. For any ε > 0 there is a positive constant C independent of h such that

ku(k) − u(k)

h kL2(Ω) ≤ Chα+1/2−ε,

(4.1)

where u(k)

is chosen in such a way that(cid:16)Πhu(k), u(k)

:= max
i6=k

and the quantity

.

Then

(4.2)

ku(k) − u(k)

h kL2(Ω) ≤ ku(k) − Πhu(k)kL2(Ω) + kΠhu(k) − ω(k)

h kL2(Ω) + kω(k)

h − u(k)

h kL2(Ω).

We are going to estimate the terms in the right hand side separately.

Given ε > 0, it follows from our regularity estimate (1.5) that there exists C > 0 independent

of h such that

Moreover, since

we have

ku(k) − Πhu(k)kL2(Ω) ≤ Chα+1/2−ε.

Finally, let us show that

Indeed, on one hand we have

Therefore, if we choose the sign of u(k)

as stated in (4.5).

h kL2(Ω) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1 −(cid:16)Πhu(k), u(k)

h (cid:17) ≥ 0, we deduce

h kL2(Ω),

h (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ku(k) − ω(k)

h kL2(Ω) = 1, we have

Thus, estimate (4.1) is obtained by combining (4.2), (4.3), (4.4) and (4.5).

(cid:3)

Our next step is to prove the rate of convergence for the eigenvalues.

Lemma 4.2. For any ε > 0 there is a positive constant C independent of h such that

(4.6)

0 ≤ λ(k)

h − λ(k) ≤ Ch1−ε.

Proof. By Remark 2.6 we only have to prove the second inequality. Developing the inner product

we arrive at

Therefore, by (4.7), (4.8), (1.4) and taking into account that ku(k)

5. Order of convergence: Multiple eigenfunctions

In this section we show the order of convergence in the case of multiple eigenspaces. For
simplicity we prove the case of double eigenvalues, but the argument we carry may be easily
generalized to any multiplicity. We write λ = λ(k) = λ(k+1) and take u(k) and u(k+1) to be two
corresponding orthogonal eigenfunctions. Throughout this section we also employ the notation

αh =(cid:16)Πhu(k), u(k)

h (cid:17) , βh =(cid:16)Πhu(k), u(k+1)

h

(cid:17) , δh =(cid:16)Πhu(k+1), u(k)

and w(k+1)

h

= δhu(k)

h + γhu(k+1)

h

.

As in the previous section, we divide the proof of Theorem 1.5 into three lemmas. The proof

of the ﬁrst one is obtained as in [4], following the lines of Lemma 4.1.

Lemma 5.1. For any ε > 0, there is a positive constant C independent of h such that

(5.1)

ku(j) − w(j)

h kL2(Ω) ≤ Chα+1/2−ε,

j = k, k + 1.

where α is given by Proposition 1.2.

Our next step is to prove the rate of convergence for the eigenvalues.

Lemma 5.2. For any ε > 0, there is a positive constant C independent of h such that

(5.2)

0 ≤ λ(j)

h − λ ≤ Ch1−ε,

j = k, k + 1.

Proof. By Remark 2.6, in order to prove (5.2) we only have to show the second inequality. First
observe that an identity analogous to (4.7) is feasible. More precisely, in this case we have

V − λku(k) − w(k)

h − Πhu(k)k2
h (cid:17) −(cid:16)αhλ(k)

h − βhλ(k+1)

h − Πhu(k)kV ≤ Chkλu(k) − αhλ(k)
kw(k)
h kw(k)

Thus, by the Poincar´e inequality

proof in three cases.

Case 1. There is a positive constant c such that |αh| ≥ c and |βh| ≥ c.

Since αhn → 0 and |βhn| → 1, for n great enough |αhn| ≤ |βhn|, and therefore by (5.6), (5.5)
and the fact that α2

monotone in h (j = k, k + 1), the desired conclusion follows.

h → 1 we have that (5.2) is true for a subsequence. But since {λ(j)

Case 3. There exist subsequences satisfying βhn → 0 and |αhn| → 1.

Observe that changing u(k) by u(k+1), this is just Case 2. This concludes the proof.

(cid:3)

Our last result follows from (5.3), (5.1) and (5.2), in the same fashion as Lemma 4.3.

Lemma 5.3. For any ε > 0, there is a positive constant C independent of h such that

ku(j) − w(j)

h kV ≤ Ch1/2−ε,

j = k, k + 1.

6. Numerical results

In order to illustrate the convergence estimates obtained in Sections 4 and 5, we present the
results of numerical tests for ﬁnite element discretizations of one and two-dimensional eigenvalue
problems. Moreover, in the latter case, some examples in domains that do not satisfy the
hypotheses of Proposition 1.1 are displayed. These examples provide numerical evidence that
the assertion of this proposition still holds true under weaker assumptions about the domain.

Since in general no closed formula for the eigenvalues of the fractional Laplacian is available,

we have estimated the order of convergence by means of a least-squares ﬁtting of the model

λ(k)
h = λ(k) + Chα.

This allows to extrapolate approximations of the eigenvalues as well (in the tables we denote
this extrapolated value of λ(k) as λ(k)

ext).

Throughout this section, the results are compared with those available in the literature. In ﬁrst
place we consider one-dimensional problems, which have been widely studied both theoretically
and from the numerical point of view. Next, we show some examples in two-dimensional domains:
the unit ball, a square and an L-shaped domain. As for the ball, the deep results of [14] allow
to obtain sharp estimates on the eigenvalues, and thus provide a point of comparison for the
validity of the FE implementation. Regarding the square, some estimates for the eigenvalues
are found in [24]. The main interest of the L-shaped domain is that, although it does not
satisfy the “standard” requirements to regularity of eigenfunctions to hold, the numerical order
of convergence is the same as in problems posed on smooth, convex domains.

General estimates for eigenvalues, valid for a class of domains, are obtained by Chen and Song
[8]. In that paper, the authors state upper and lower bounds for eigenvalues of the fractional
Laplacian on domains satisfying the exterior cone condition. Calling µ(k) the k-th eigenvalue
of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditione domain Ω, they prove that there exists a
constant C = C(Ω) such that

C(cid:16)µ(k)(cid:17)s

≤ λ(k) ≤(cid:16)µ(k)(cid:17)s

.

(6.1)

If Ω is a bounded convex domain, then C can be taken as 1/2. It is noteworthy that, due to
the scaling property of the fractional Laplacian, eigenvalues for the dilations of a domain Ω are
obtained by means of λ(k)(γΩ) = γ−2sλ(k)(Ω).

Since we are working with conforming methods, as well as providing approximations, the
discrete eigenvalues yield upper bounds for the corresponding continuous eigenvalues. This is of

special interest in those cases in which theoretical estimates are not sharp, or the non-symmetry
of the domain precludes the possibility of developing arguments such as the ones in [14].

6.1. One-dimensional intervals. Eigenvalues for the fractional Laplacian in intervals have
been studied by other authors previously. In [39], a discretized model of the fractional Laplacian
is developed, and a numerical study of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues is implemented for diﬀerent
boundary conditions. In [23], the authors deal with one dimensional problems for s = 1/2, and
provide asymptotic expansion for eigenvalues. Later, Kwa´snicki [24] extended this work to the
whole range s ∈ (0, 1). Namely, he showed the following identity for the k-th eigenvalue in the
interval (−1, 1):
(6.2)

(1 − s)π

+

Moreover, in that work a method to obtain lower bounds in arbitrary bounded domains is
developed, and it is proved that, on one spacial dimension, eigenvalues are simple if s ≥ 1/2. As
eigenvalues are simple and we are working in one dimension, it is not diﬃcult to numerically
estimate the order of convergence of eigenfunctions in the L2-norm. Indeed, normalizing the
discrete eigenfunctions so that ku(k)
h kL2(−1,1) = 1 and choosing their sign adequately (recall

Section 4), these are then compared with a solution on a very ﬁne grid.

On the other hand, in [13] it is performed a numerical study of the fractional Schr¨odinger
equation in an inﬁnite potential well in one spacial dimension. The authors ﬁnd numerically
the ground and ﬁrst excited states and their corresponding eigenvalues for the stationary linear
problem, which corresponds to the ﬁrst two eigenpairs of our equation (1.1).

In Table 6.1, our results for the ﬁrst 2 eigenpairs are displayed. The extrapolated numerical
values are compared with the estimates from [13, 24]; the orders of convergence are in good
agreement with those predicted correspondingly by (4.6) and (4.1).

Unit ball. Let us consider the fractional eigenvalue problem on the two-dimensional unit ball. In
[15], the weighted operator u 7→ (−∆)s(ω u) is studied, where ω(x) = (1 − |x|2)s
+. In particular,
explicit formulas for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are established. Furthermore, in [14] the
same authors exploit these expressions to obtain two-sided bounds for the eigenvalues of the
fractional Laplacian in the unit ball in any dimension. This method provides sharp estimates;
however, it depends on the decomposition of the fractional Laplacian as a weighted operator,
and the weight ω is only explicitly known for the unit ball.

In Table 6.2, our results for the ﬁrst eigenvalue are compared with those of [14] for diﬀerent
values of s. This comparison serves as a test for the validity of the code we are employing.
As well as the extrapolated value of λ(1) and the numerical order of convergence, for every s
considered we exhibit an upper bound for the ﬁrst eigenvalue. These outcomes are consistent
with those from [14] and the theoretical order of convergence given by (4.6).

Square. Eigenvalue estimates for the case in which the domain Ω is a square in R2 were also
addressed in [24]. However, in order to obtain upper bounds, the method proposed in that work
depends on having pointwise bounds of the Green function for the fractional Laplacian on Ω.
The estimates from [8, 24] are compared with our results in Table 6.3, where numerical orders
of convergence are also displayed.

L-shaped domain. To the authors knowledge, there is no eﬃcient method to estimate eigenvalues
of the fractional Laplacian if the domain Ω lacks symmetry. The bound (6.1) remains valid as
long as Ω satisﬁes the assumptions required, but the range that estimate provides is quite wide.
The main advantage of employing the ﬁnite element method is that it is ﬂexible enough to
cope with a variety of domains. Moreover, as we are working with conforming approximations,
sharp upper bounds for the eigenvalues may be obtained by considering discrete solutions on
reﬁned meshes.

In Proposition 1.1, which states that eigenfunctions belong to eH s+1/2−ε(Ω), it was assumed
that the domain Ω was smooth. For the Laplacian, in order to prove regularity of solutions, it is
customary to assume that Ω is either smooth or at least convex. In those cases, it is well known
that if f ∈ H r(Ω) for some r, then the solutions of the Dirichlet problem with datum f belong
to H r+2(Ω). However, if the domain has a re-entrant corner, solutions are less regular. This
also applies to eigenfunctions: in the L-shaped domain Ω = [−1, 1]2 \ [0, 1]2, the ﬁrst eigenvalue
of the Laplacian is known not to belong to H 3/2(Ω).

Surprisingly, numerical evidence indicates that eigenvalues of the fractional Laplacian on this
L-shaped domain converge with the same order as in the previous examples. This motivates us
to conjecture that eigenfunctions and solutions to the Dirichlet equation (2.2) have the same
Sobolev regularity than in smooth domains.

Our ﬁndings for the ﬁrst eigenvalue are summarized in Table 6.4.
