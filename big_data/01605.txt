High-stress Si3N4 nanoresonators have become an attractive choice for electro- and optomechani-
cal devices. Membrane resonators can achieve quality factor (Q) - frequency (f ) products exceeding
1013 Hz, enabling (in principle) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam
resonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller Q· f products; however, on account of their much
larger Q-to-mass ratio and reduced mode density, they remain a canonical choice for precision force,
mass, and charge sensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at
cryogenic temperatures. Here we explore two techniques to enhance the Q-factor of a nanomechan-
ical beam. The techniques relate to two main loss mechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for
large aspect ratios and f (cid:46) 100 MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios
and f (cid:38) 100 MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D phononic crystal, it is
possible to localize its ﬂexural motion and shield it against radiation loss. Using this method, we
realize f > 100 MHz modes with Q ∼ 104, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply
with unshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the Q· f products of high-order modes
of mm-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape dependence of stress-induced ‘loss-
dilution’, we realize a f ≈ 4 MHz mode with Q · f ≈ 9 · 1012 Hz. Our results can extend room
temperature quantum coherent operation to ultra-low-mass 1D nanomechanical oscillators.

Silicon nitride (SiN) nanomembranes and beams have
emerged as striking exceptions to the empirical Q ∝ V 1/3
scaling of solid-state mechanical oscillators [1]. Much of
the recent history of this development can be traced to
the ‘discovery’ that a commercial TEM slide made of 100
nm-thick LPCVD Si3N4, forming a membrane resonator,
can realize a room temperature Q· f > 6· 1012 Hz as well
as ppm-level optical loss [2, 3]. The former constitutes a
basic requirement for quantum-coherent evolution (since
in this case the oscillator’s frequency f is larger than
its thermal decoherence rate, kBT /hQ), while the lat-
ter enables integration into a high ﬁnesse optical cavity,
allowing for quantum-limited displacement readout and
actuation [4, 5]. Encouraged by these prospects, consid-
erable eﬀort has been made to understand the source of
high Q in SiN ﬁlms. It is now generally accepted to be
the large (∼ 1 GPa) tensile stress resulting from LPCVD,
which increases the elastic energy stored in the ﬁlm with-
out changing the material loss tangent [6–9] (a concept
in fact dating back to mirror pendulum supports in grav-
itational wave interferometers [10]). Exploiting this in-
sight, radio frequency membranes with room tempera-
ture Q · f > 1013 Hz have recently been realized, using a
combination of high order modes [3, 11], stress engineer-
ing [12], and acoustically-shielded supports [13, 14].

In this report we study two strategies for reducing
the dissipation of a high-stress SiN nanobeam, the 1D
analog of a membrane which is in principle capable of
Q· f > 1013 Hz with orders of magnitude lower mass and
signiﬁcantly reduced mode density, making it suitable
for precision mass [16], charge [17], and force [18] sens-
ing, in addition to quantum optomechanics experiments
[2, 19]. The major challenge associated with nanobeams
is their small form factor, which makes it diﬃcult to
transduce their motion. Towards this end, we employ

√
a microcavity-based near-ﬁeld sensor [2] capable of non-
Hz reso-
invasive thermal noise measurements with fm/
lution. Our ﬁrst strategy is to pattern short (< 10 µm),
very-high-frequency (> 100 MHz) nanobeams [20], for
which an important source of loss is acoustic radiation.
To address this challenge, we pattern the nanobeam as
a defect in a 1D phononic crystal (PnC). When the fre-
quency of a beam mode coincides with a band-gap of
the PnC, the latter acts as an acoustic shield, eﬀectively
localizing ﬂexural motion and suppressing radiation loss
[21–23]. Using this strategy, we realize localized ﬂexu-
ral modes with eﬀective mass m < 1 pg, f > 100 MHz
and Q ∼ 104, consistent with internal loss and contrast-
ing sharply with unshielded beams of similar dimensions.

FIG. 2. Simulation of defect modes and the phononic crystal bandgap. (a) Schematic diagram of the device (top view),
consisting of a nanobeam (green) patterned as a defect in a 1D phononic crystal (pink). Unit cell dimensions used in this work
are (h1,L1)=(100 nm,3 µm) for the short segment and (h2,L2)=(1.5 µm,3 µm) for the long segment. The SiN thickness of all
devices is 400 nm. (b) Simulated fundamental eigenfrequency of a defect beam with in-plane thickness h = 100 nm and length
L = 2 − 16 µm. Gray regions indicate bandgaps for in-plane ﬂexural modes. Six representative modes are highlighted; their
FEM-simulated modeshapes are plotted on the left. (c) Dispersion diagram of the phononic crystal. Curves represent diﬀerent
modes of the unit cell, color-coded according to symmetry (red, blue, green, and orange correspond to in-plane, out-of-plane,
breathing, and torsional modes, respectively). Gray regions correspond to pseudo-bandgaps for in-plane modes.

Our second strategy is to study the high order modes of
mm-long nanobeams, which exhibit enhanced Q · f due
to tensile stress. We demonstrate that by appropriate
choice of beam length and mode order, it is possible to
realize m ∼ 10 pg, f ∼ 10 MHz modes with a ‘quantum-
enabled’ Q · f ≈ 1013 Hz, a regime previously accessed
only by m ∼ 10 ng membrane resonators [3, 11, 13].

We ﬁrst consider the device shown in Fig. 1. Here
a high-stress Si3N4 thin ﬁlm has been patterned into a
1D PnC with a beam-like defect at its center. From the
standpoint of the beam, the crystal acts like a radiation
shield [13, 14, 24], the performance of which is deter-
mined by the band structure of the box-shaped unit cell.
A simulation of the dispersion diagram of the unit cell
is shown in Fig. 2c, with lines of diﬀerent color corre-
sponding to modes of the cell with diﬀerent symmetries.
In this work, we consider only in-plane ﬂexural modes
because of their compatibility with displacement read-
out (using the microcavity-based sensor shown in blue
in Fig. 1). Pseudo-bandgaps for in-plane symmetry are
indicated by gray shading in Fig. 2c. The presence of a
bandgap implies strong reﬂection of waves from the PnC.
It also implies the support of localized defect modes. To
illustrate this concept, a simulation of the fundamental
ﬂexural mode of a beam embedded in a 14-element PnC

is shown in Fig. 2b. Dimensions of the beam and unit
cell are given in the caption. The beam’s length is varied
to span the frequency range of the three bandgaps shown
in Fig. 2c. Qualitatively, it is evident that modes which
are well-centered in a bandgap (1,3,5) exhibit strong con-
ﬁnement. Conversely, modes near the edge of a bandgap
(2,4,6) penetrate deeply into the PnC. This is because the
defect modes start to hybridize with the in-plane modes
of the unit cell, shown as red curves in Fig. 2c.

Our central claim is that localized defect modes will
exhibit reduced radiation loss and similar eﬀective mass
relative to unshielded beams. To demonstrate this con-
cept, shielded and unshielded beams of various lengths
were fabricated (see [25]) and tested. To probe mechan-
ical displacement, an elliptical microdisk cavity is pat-
terned next to each beam, separated by ∼ 80 nm. Whis-
pering gallery modes of the microdisk are excited with
a detuned 1550 nm laser ﬁeld using a tapered optical
√
ﬁber, enabling evanescent displacement readout [2] with
an imprecision of ∼ 1 fm/
Hz. All measurements were
performed in a vacuum chamber at 10−4 mbar in order to
reduce gas damping. In conjunction with the relatively
large cavity linewidth of ∼ 1 GHz (mitigating radiation
pressure eﬀects), this enables non-invasive thermal noise
measurements for beams as short as 4 µm.

responding to L ∼ 10 µm, at which the Q of unshielded
beams changes from Q ∝ f−1 to a Q ∝ e−α(f−f0).
By contrast, shielded beams with L < 10 µm exhibit a
roughly constant Q, suggesting a qualitatively diﬀerent
loss mechanism compared to unshielded beams.
To understand the scaling of Q in Fig. 4, we consider
a model of the form Q−1 = Q−1
rad, where Qint and
Qrad are models of loss due to internal friction and ra-
diation of acoustic waves (phonon tunneling [5]) into the
solid-state supports, respectively. We ﬁrst consider inter-
nal loss, adopting a standard model that treats the ﬁlm
as an anelastic plate subject to cyclic loading [6–10]. In
this approach, friction is treated as a delay between in-
ternal strain and stress (i.e., a complex Young’s modulus,
E) [26]. The enhanced Q of stressed ﬁlms is related to
a renormalization of the total elastic energy, viz., adding
tensile stress σ contributes an energy due to elongation,
Uelong ∝ σ, without substantially increasing the energy
stored in bending, Ubend ∝ E (which gives rise to dis-
sipation) [6]. The Q of a stressed ﬁlm is thus enhanced
relative to the unstressed case Q0 = Re[E]/Im[E] by ap-
proximately Q/Q0 ≈ 1 + Uelong/Ubend. The magnitude
of the ‘loss-dilution’ factor Q/Q0 depends on the stressed
mode shape. For the string-like modes of stressed beams
with thickness h (cid:28) L, it can be shown that [6, 8, 9]

and the eﬀective mass is estimated by bootstrapping the lat-

mode #1. Shaded regions correspond to the PnC bandgaps

As a demonstration of spatial mode conﬁnement, the
thermal displacement noise spectrum of a 5 µm-long de-
fect embedded in a 100 µm-long, 14-cell PnC is presented
in Fig. 3. The fundamental in-plane mode of the defect
appears at 74 MHz, situated within a large, spectrally
quiet window coinciding with the pseudo-bandgap of the
PnC. The small eﬀective mass of the defect mode mani-
fests in the relatively large area beneath the thermal noise
peak (cid:104)x2(cid:105) ≈ kBT /(4mπ2f 2). Comparing ((cid:104)x2(cid:105)f 2)−1 for
the defect mode to that of adjacent peaks (green points)
reveals a 1000-fold decrease in m relative to the funda-
mental in-plane mode of the extended structure. Quanti-
tative agreement of this scaling with an FEM simulation
(red points, assuming a point-like probed at the midpoint
of the defect) corroborates an estimated eﬀective mass of
m ≈ 1 pg for the localized mode. The corresponding
ﬁtted mechanical linewidth is γ = 5.1 kHz (Q ≡ f /γ =
1.4 · 104), giving access to a low thermal-noise-limited
force sensitivity of 8πkBT mγ = (0.7 fN/

Hz)2.

√

To assess the performance of the PnC as an acoustic
shield, we have made a comprehensive study of Q vs f
for shielded and unshielded beams of various lengths, us-
ing thermal noise measurements as in Fig. 3. Results
are compiled in Fig. 4. Green and red points corre-
spond to shielded and unshielded beams with lengths
of L = 12.2 − 4.1 µm and 10.5 − 90.5 µm, respectively,
comprising a total of 121 independent devices. The most
striking feature is a sharp transition at f0 ∼ 50 MHz, cor-

at the antinodes of the ﬂexural mode, respectively, which
depends on the mode order, n. The value of λ can be
estimated from the dispersion relation

f (σ, n) ≈ f0n(cid:112)(1 + n2π2λ2),

where f0 ≈ (1/2L)(cid:112)σ/ρ.

Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) are used to model the internal loss
of beams with two widths (h = 120, 300 nm) in Fig. 4
(solid black lines). A value of λ ≈ 5 · (h/L) is obtained
by ﬁtting measurements of f versus n to Eq. (2) (see
Fig. 5). A value of Q0 ≈ 5 · 103 · (h/100 nm) is ob-
tained by bootstrapping to the Q ∝ f−1 scaling of long
(λ (cid:28) 1) unshielded beams. The inferred surface loss
coeﬃcient of Q0/h ≈ 50 nm−1 agrees well with the ﬁnd-
ings of Villanueva et. al.
[9]; however, Q0 cannot be
accessed directly with unshielded beams due the large
deviation from the internal loss model for f (cid:38) 50 MHz
(L (cid:46) 10 µm). Remarkably, the Q of shielded beams
(green points) recovers to the expected internal loss scal-
ing for f ∼ 50 − 200 MHz (L ∼ 4 − 12 µm), suggesting
that the loss mechanism is acoustic radiation.

To conﬁrm that the deviation from the internal loss
model in Fig. 4 is due to acoustic radiation, we have
conducted a no-free-parameter ﬁnite element simulation
using COMSOL (for details see [25]). The geometry and
stress-proﬁle of the beam and PnC are determined from
SEM imaging. The result of the simulation is shown as a
solid blue line Fig. 4 and agrees qualitatively well with the
data. Notably, the cutoﬀ frequency for radiation losses
depends sensitively son the geometry of the beam near
the end-supports, as well as the support pillars (also in-
cluded in the model). Chamfering the beam at its ends,
as shown in Fig. 1 reduces the knee to f ∼ 50 MHz,
which is lower than has been observed for beams of sim-
ilar dimensions with no end-chamfer [20].

Having addressed the challenge of reducing radiation
loss in short, VHF beams, we now study a strategy for
achieving high Q·f while keeping m ﬁxed, by using higher
order modes. Assuming λ (cid:28) 1 and treating n as a con-
tinuous variable in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the maximum

Q · f is obtained at nopt ≈(cid:112)2/(π2λ) and is given by

Therefore high Q· f may be obtained by using high order
modes of long and thin beams. We note that demonstra-
tions of high-stress Si3N4 membranes with Q · f > 1013
Hz also exploit this scaling, with the mode index n in
Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) replaced by n2 → n2 + m2. For

odd-ordered ﬂexural modes of nanobeams with lengths L =

for Q including internal loss (Eq. (1)) and an estimated gas

nanobeams appears to be related to the fact that larger
membranes (L ∼ 1 mm) have been studied [3, 8, 11].

To explore the prediction made in Eq. (3), we have
measured Q(n) and f (n) for odd-ordered modes of un-
shielded beams with thickness h = 100 nm and lengths
varying from L = 0.95−1.28 mm. Results are shown in 5.
To mitigate systematic error associated with the sub-Hz
mechanical linewidths, in this case Q was extracted from
ringdown measurements. To perform a ringdown, the
beam is resonantly excited using a piezo located beneath
the sample chip; the drive is then shuttered oﬀ while dis-
placement is continuously recorded using a network an-
alyzer (with bandwidth B (cid:29) γ). For the longest beam,
L = 1.28 mm, we observe a maximum of Q· f ≈ 9.0· 1012
for n = 21 (f ≈ 4 MHz). We compare this to a model
curve for Q(n) · f (n) (solid black line) based on a value
of λ = 5· h/L estimated by ﬁtting the dispersion relation
f (n) (Eq. (2)). The model predicts Q(nopt) · f (nopt) to
within 10%, but qualitatively overestimates Q for lower
frequencies. This discrepancy is due to gas damping,
which contributes a systematic additional damping of
γgas ≈ 0.15 Hz.

We emphasize that while the concept of PnC acous-
tic shielding has recently been explored in the context of
nanomembranes [13, 14] and nanobeams [24], our results,
to the best of the authors’ knowledge, represent the ﬁrst
explicit demonstration that the intrinsic Q of a nanome-
chanical resonator can be recovered in the presence of
otherwise dominant radiation loss. Moreover, the value of
Q· f ≈ 9.0· 1012 demonstrated in Fig. 5 establishes a new
benchmark for high-stress SiN nanobeams. In conjunc-
tion with the large zero-point motion and sparse mode
density of nanobeams, and building on recent advances in

are furthermore readily extended to alternative materials
such as diamond [28], opening the door for studying the
microphysics of internal loss [29]. PnC-shielded nanores-
onators may also ﬁnd application as high frequency me-
chanical ﬁlters and oscillators [30, 31].

SAMPLE FABRICATION

A. Overview

Nanobeam-microdisk samples as shown in Fig. 1 of the main text are fabricated according to the procedure outlined
in Fig. 1. The process begins with a series of low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) steps on a 4” CZ
Si wafer. 400 nm of stoichiometric Si3N4 (SiN) is deposited at 800◦C, followed by 100 nm of amorphous Si (a-Si) at
500◦C (to be used as a hard mask). The microdisk and nanobeam are patterned on top of the a-Si ﬁlm by electron
beam lithography, in 100 nm of HSQ. The pattern is transfered into the a-Si ﬁlm (creating a hard mask for the
subsequent SiN etch) using a HBr etch process. The pattern is then transfered into the SiN ﬁlm by reactive ion
etching, using an SPTS APS Dielectric Etcher and CHF3 chemistry. The process is concluded by undercutting the
microdisk and nanobeam with KOH, followed by critical point drying.

Fabrication considerations related optomechanical coupling

The fabrication process was developed and optimized with two goals in mind: (1) to minimize the in-plane gap (x)
between the nanobeam and the microdisk and (2) to minimize the sidewall roughness of the microdisk. Small x is
desirable as it gives rise to a large parametric (optomechanical) coupling G = ∂ωc/∂x between the lateral position
of the beam and the frequency ωc of the microdisk whispering gallery mode (WGM) [1]. For beams with in-plane
thickness much smaller than the operating wavelength λ, it can be shown that G ∝ e−x/xev , where xev ∼ λ/10 is the
in-plane evanescent decay length of the WGM [2]. Thus a design gap of x < 100 nm was chosen in conjunction with
an operating wavelength of λ ≈ 1550 nm. Low sidewall roughness is desirable in order to reduce the possibility of

of 31 µm and ellipticity (ratio of the major and minor radii) varying from 1 to 4. WGMs of diﬀerent polarization and radial
order were measured, giving rise observed variation in optical loss for each ellipticity. Red points highlight the best value from
each measurement set.

WGM loss (κ) due to Rayleigh scattering from the disk’s surface [3]. Collectively, increasing G and reducing κ was
crucial to achieving the high sensitivity displacement measurements shown in Fig. 3 and employed in Figs. 4-5 of the
main text. For example, in Fig. 3 of the main text, the thermomechanical signal-to-noise (in this case dominated by
electronic detector noise) is proportional to (G2P/κ)2, where P is the optical input power [1].

The requirements for etching optically smooth sidewalls separated by x < 100 nm depends on the thickness of the
SiN ﬁlm. We chose a t = 400 nm-thick ﬁlm as a compromise between achieving a large WGM evanescence and low
WGM radiation loss. Achieving a vertical x < 100 nm gap thus required etching SiN with an aspect ratio much better
than 1:4. We found that achieving this aspect ratio while maintaining an optically smooth surface was diﬃcult with
standard RIE etching techniques (employing standard e-beam resists), due to mask erosion. It is for this reason that
a-Si was employed as a secondary hard mask. a-Si provides high selectivity (>1:10) relative to SiN in RIE as well as
high resistance to mask erosion. Thus we have achieved gaps as small as x ≈ 80 nm and relatively smooth sidewalls,
characterized by optical quality factors in excess of 105 in the absence of a beam (see Fig. 2). For the results shown
in Figs. 3-5 of the main text, we employed elliptical microdisks with a ﬁxed circumference of approximately 30 µm,
an ellipticity (major radius over minor radius) ranging from 1 to 4, and x = 80 − 200 nm. Typical intrinsic optical
linewidths of κ/2π = 1 − 10 GHz were observed. An estimate of G(x = 100 nm) ∼ 100 MHz/nm is obtained by
approximating the microdisk WGM proﬁle with the analytical form of a microtoroid WGM, as discussed in [2, 4].

II. ACOUSTIC RADIATION LOSS MODEL

A. Overview

The radiation loss model shown in Fig. 4 of the main text was obtained by computing the complex eigenfrequency
spectrum of the mechanical structure surrounded by numerically implemented PML (perfectly matched layer, corre-
sponding to a perfectly impedance matched and aborbing boundary). We used the COMSOL Structural Mechanics
Finite Element Analysis software package for this simulation. The modeled structure is shown in gray in Fig. 2a, and
includes the SiN defect beam, SiN PnC, SiN support pads, the Si pillars beneath each support pad, a half-spherical
section of the Si substrate. The blue shell in Fig. 2a corresponds to the PML. By placing the PML far from the
nanobeam, we ensure that reﬂection of acoustic waves from the supports is accounted for in the simulation. We also
ensure that the size of the PML is large enough that its own reﬂection coeﬃcient is negligible [5, 6]. Visualization of
acoustic radiation into the PML is shown in Fig. 2c. Radiation loss manifests as an imaginary component of each

numerically computed eigenfrequency, Ωm. The eigenfrequency of the defect mode is identiﬁed based on its mode
shape. Radiation-loss-limited Q-factors (blue curve in Fig. 4 of the main text) are obtained from the formula:

Re[Ωm]
2 · Im[Ωm]

The location of the knee point in the model of Qrad versus f in Fig. 4 of the main text depends on the dimensions
of the extended mechanical structure, in particular that of Si pillars and the trapezoidal end-points of the beam (c.f.
Fig. 1a in the main text). The blue curve shown in Fig. 4 of the main text employs dimensions obtained from SEM
imaging and uses no ﬁt parameters.

B. Role of number of unit cells

The acoustic impedance of the PnC depends on the number of unit cells used. We employed a 7-cell PnC to obtain
the results described in the main text. This choice was based on a model of Qrad versus number of cells. An example
is shown in Fig. 4: here a 2.3 µm defect with a frequency of 542 MHz is embedded in the 3rd bandgap of the PnC
described in Fig. 2 of the main text. As illustrated in the ﬁgure, only 3 cells are required to reduce the radiation loss
by a factor of 106, to a value ∼ 6 orders of magnitude larger than Qint; also shielding evidently saturates at ∼ 6 cells.
A conservative choice of 7 cells was made in the experiment to allow for design imperfections.
