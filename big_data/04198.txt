CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

MICHA L MISIUREWICZ† AND SAMUEL ROTH§

Abstract. For a transitive countably piecewise monotone Markov interval map
we consider the question whether there exists a conjugate map of constant slope.
The answer varies depending on whether the map is continuous or only piecewise
continuous, whether it is mixing or not, what slope we consider, and whether the
conjugate map is deﬁned on a bounded interval, half-line or the whole real line (with
the inﬁnities included).

1. Introduction

Among piecewise monotone interval maps, the simplest to understand are the piece-
wise linear maps with the same absolute value of slope on every piece; such maps are
said to have constant slope (and we will usually say “slope” in the meaning “absolute
value of slope”). These maps oﬀer the dynamicist many advantages. For example, if
we wish to compute the topological entropy, we just take the larger of zero and the
logarithm of the slope. If we wish to study the symbolic dynamics and the slope is
larger than one, then no two points can share the same itinerary; this already rules
out wandering intervals.

There are two classic results by which constant slope maps provide a good model for
understanding more general piecewise monotone maps. Nearly ﬁfty years ago, Parry
proved that every topologically transitive, piecewise monotone (and even piecewise
continuous) interval map is conjugate to a map of constant slope [8]. Then, in the
1980’s, Milnor and Thurston showed how to modify Parry’s theorem to remove the
hypothesis of topological transitivity [5]. As long as a piecewise monotone map has
positive topological entropy log λ, there exists a semiconjugacy to a map of constant
slope λ. The semiconjugating map is nondecreasing, preserving the order of points in
the interval, but perhaps collapsing some subintervals down to single points.

It is natural to ask how well the theory extends to countably piecewise monotone
maps, when we no longer require the set of turning points to be ﬁnite, but still require
it to have a countable closure. The theory has to be modiﬁed in several ways. In
contrast to Parry’s result, it is possible to construct transitive examples which are
not conjugate to any interval map of constant slope. Such examples are contained in
the authors’ prior publication [7]. However, those particular examples are conjugate
to constant slope maps on the extended real line [−∞,∞], which we may choose
to regard as an interval of inﬁnite length.
In response, Bobok and Bruin posed
the following problem: Under what conditions does a countably piecewise monotone
interval map admit a conjugacy to a map of constant slope on the extended real line?

The present paper answers this problem, focusing on the Markov case. Section 2
gives the necessary deﬁnitions, then closes with a theorem due to Bobok [2], that
there exists a nondecreasing semiconjugacy to a map of constant slope λ > 1 on
the ﬁnite length interval [0, 1] if and only if the relevant transition matrix admits a
nonnegative eigenvector with eigenvalue λ and summable entries.

We investigate whether eliminating the summability requirement on the eigenvector
might allow for the construction of constant slope models on the extended real line.
We ﬁnd two new obstructions, not present in previous works. We present one example
which is topologically transitive but not mixing (Section 12), and one example which
is mixing but only piecewise continuous (Section 11), and we show for both of these
examples that although the transition matrix admits a nonnegative eigenvector with
some eigenvalue λ, nevertheless there is no conjugacy to any map of constant slope λ.
These are the only two obstructions; under the assumptions of continuity and topo-
logical mixing, we state in Section 3 our main theorem, Theorem 3.1, that a countably
piecewise monotone and Markov map which is continuous and mixing admits a con-
jugacy to a map of constant slope λ on some non-empty, compact (sub)interval of
the extended real line [−∞,∞] if and only if the associated Markov transition matrix
admits a nonnegative eigenvector of eigenvalue λ. Sections 4 through 7 are dedicated
to the proof of Theorem 3.1.

Sections 8 through 10 apply Theorem 3.1 to three explicit examples of continuous
countably piecewise monotone Markov maps. The ﬁrst admits conjugate maps of
constant slope on the unit interval. The second admits conjugate maps of constant
slope on the extended real line and the extended half line. The third does not admit
any conjugate map of constant slope. These sections illustrate a variety of novel
techniques for calculating the nonnegative eigenvectors of a countable 0-1 matrix and
for calculating the topological entropy of a countably piecewise monotone map.

2. Definitions and Background

The extended real line [−∞,∞] is the ordered set R∪{∞,−∞} equipped with the
order topology; this topological space is a two-point compactiﬁcation of the real line
and is homeomorphic to the closed unit interval [0, 1].

There is an exceedingly simple example which illustrates how the extended real
line behaves diﬀerently than the unit interval with respect to constant slope maps.
Consider the map f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] given by f (x) = x2. A conjugate map on the
unit interval must be monotone with ﬁxed points at 0 and 1, and the only constant
slope map with those properties is the identity map. On the other hand, the map
g : [−∞,∞] → [−∞,∞] given by g(x) = x − 1 has constant slope 1 and is conjugate
to f by the homeomorphism h : [0, 1] → [−∞,∞], h(x) = − log2(− log2(x)). Thus,
we achieve constant slope by taking advantage of the inﬁnite length of the extended
real line and pushing our ﬁxed points out to ±∞, see Figure 1.
Suppose f is a continuous self-map of some interval [a, b], −∞ ≤ a < b ≤ ∞, and
suppose there exists a closed, countable set P ⊂ [a, b], a, b ∈ P , such that f (P ) ⊂ P
and f is monotone on each component of [a, b]\ P . Such a map is said to be countably
piecewise monotone and Markov with respect to the partition set P ; the components
of [a, b]\ P are called P -basic intervals, and the set of all P -basic intervals is denoted
B(P ). If additionally the restriction of f to each P -basic interval is aﬃne with slope

of absolute value λ, then we say that f has constant slope λ. This is a geometric,
rather than a topological property, and it is the reason we must distinguish ﬁnite from
inﬁnite length intervals. The class of all continuous countably piecewise monotone
and Markov maps is denoted CPMM. The subclass of those maps which act on the
closed unit interval [0, 1] is denoted CPMM[0,1].
Let us draw the reader’s attention to three properties of the class CPMM. First,
the underlying interval [a, b] depends on the map f and is permitted to be inﬁnite
in length. Second, the map f is required to be globally (rather than piecewise)
continuous; this is essential for our use of the intermediate value theorem. And third,
the set P is required to be forward-invariant. This is the Markov condition; it means
that if I, J are P -basic intervals and f (I) ∩ J 6= ∅, then f (I) ⊇ J.
If f is countably piecewise monotone and Markov with respect to P , then we deﬁne
the binary transition matrix T = T (f, P ) with rows and columns indexed by B(P )
and entries

(1)

T (I, J) =(1,

0,

if f (I) ⊇ J
otherwise.

This transition matrix represents a linear operator on the linear space RB(P ) without
any reference to topology.
In particular, in Theorem 2.1 below, T is not required
to represent a bounded operator on ℓ1(RB(P )), nor even to preserve the subspace
ℓ1(RB(P )) ⊂ RB(P ).
We wish also to study maps which are only piecewise continuous. To that end, we
deﬁne the class CPMMpc which contains any self-map f of any closed, nonempty
interval [a, b] ⊂ [−∞,∞], such that f has the following properties with respect to
some closed, countable set P ⊂ [a, b], a, b ∈ P , namely, that f (P ) ⊂ P , that the
restriction f|I is strictly monotone and continuous for each P -basic interval I ∈ B(P ),
and that for each pair I, J ∈ B(P ), either f (I) ∩ J = ∅ or else f (I) ⊇ J. Note that
this deﬁnition places no continuity requirements on the map f at the points of P .1
Studies on ﬁnitely piecewise continuous maps often require one-sided continuity at the
endpoints of the basic intervals (allowing the map to take 2 values at a single point),

1Although this basically means that we do not care what the values of f at the points of P are,

we still need the assumption f (P ) ⊂ P in order for P to function as a “black hole.”

4

but our countable set P may have accumulation points which are not the endpoint
of any P -basic interval, so such an approach makes no sense here. We deﬁne also
the subclass CPMMpc
[0,1] for those maps which act on the closed unit interval [0, 1],
and we deﬁne the binary transition matrix T = T (f, P ) by the same formula (1) as
before.

We will also have cause to consider the properties of topological transitivity and
topological mixing. We use the standard deﬁnitions, that a map f is topologically
transitive (respectively, topologically mixing) provided that for every pair of nonempty
open sets U, V there exists n0 ∈ N such that f n0(U) ∩ V 6= ∅ (respectively, for all
n ≥ n0, f n(U) ∩ V 6= ∅).
If we ignore the extended real line [−∞,∞] and allow only for maps on the unit
interval [0, 1], then there is already an established necessary and suﬃcient condition
to determine when a map is semiconjugate to a map of constant slope.
Theorem 2.1. (Bobok, [2]) Let f ∈ CPMMpc
[0,1] be a map with partition set P
and transition matrix T , and ﬁx λ > 1. Then f is semiconjugate via a continuous
nondecreasing map ψ to some map g ∈ CPMMpc
[0,1] of constant slope λ if and only if
T has a nonnegative eigenvector v = (vI ) ∈ ℓ1(RB(P )) with eigenvalue λ.
Remark 2.2. The statement of Theorem 2.1 in [2] is for the class CPMM[0,1] of glob-
ally continuous maps, but the proof applies equally well in the piecewise continuous
setting.

We draw the reader’s attention to the requirement v ∈ ℓ1(RB(P )) that the eigen-
vector should be summable. If we read the proof in [2], the reason for this is clear. If
we are given the semiconjugacy ψ to the constant slope map, then we construct the
eigenvector v by setting vI = |ψ(I)| for each P -basic interval I, where |·| denotes the
length of an interval, and therefore the sum of the entries vI is just the length of the
unit interval [0, 1]. Conversely, if we are given an eigenvector v, then we rescale it so
that the sum of entries is 1 and then construct the semiconjugacy in such a way that
|ψ(I)| = vI for all I, obtaining a map g of an interval of length 1.

3. Statement of Main Results

We return now to the question, when does a map f ∈ CPMM admit a nonde-
creasing semiconjugacy ψ to a map g of constant slope on some compact subinterval
of [−∞,∞], whether ﬁnite or inﬁnite in length? It is clear that g must belong to the
class CPMM, because g will necessarily be piecewise monotone and Markov with
respect to ψ(P ) – see [1, Lemma 4.6.1]. Here are the statements of our main results:
Theorem 3.1. Let f ∈ CPMM be a map with partition set P and transition matrix
T , and ﬁx λ > 1. Assume that f is topologically mixing. Then f is conjugate via a
homeomorphism ψ to some map g ∈ CPMM of constant slope λ if and only if
(2)
Theorem 3.2. In the piecewise continuous case (replacing CPMM by CPMMpc),
condition (2) is necessary but not suﬃcient.

T has a nonnegative eigenvector v = (vI) ∈ RB(P ) with eigenvalue λ.

Theorem 3.3. If we replace the hypothesis of topological mixing with the weaker
condition of topological transitivity, then condition (2) is necessary but not suﬃcient.

CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

Remark 3.4. Since the map f in Theorem 3.1 deﬁnes a topological dynamical system
without regard to geometry, there is no loss of generality if we assume that f ∈
CPMM[0,1]. We will make this assumption from now on.

We will start by showing the necessity of condition (2). The same proof applies
in all cases (continuous or piecewise continuous, mixing or transitive). Showing the
suﬃciency of condition (2) in Theorem 3.1 requires much more work. We give an
explicit construction of the conjugating map ψ in several stages. Our construction
begins very much like the proofs of [2, Theorem 2.5] and [1, Theorem 4.6.8], but the
unsummability of v introduces some additional diﬃculties not present in these previ-
ous works. It is the strength of global continuity and topological mixing which allows
us to overcome these diﬃculties. The insuﬃciency of condition (2) in Theorems 3.2
and 3.3 is proved by example in Sections 11 and 12.

4. The Proof Begins

Lemma 4.1. (Bobok) In Theorems 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, condition (2) is necessary.

Proof. This proof is due to private communication with Jozef Bobok. As mentioned
before, we may suppose that f is deﬁned on the ﬁnite interval [0, 1]. Let ψ be the
conjugating map, ψ ◦ f = g ◦ ψ. Deﬁne v by vI = |ψ(I)|, I ∈ B(P ), where |·| denotes
the length of an interval. A priori, we may have |ψ(I)| = ∞; this happens if and
only if I contains one of the endpoints 0, 1 and ψ maps this endpoint to one of ±∞.
(Recall that if 0, 1 are accumulation points of P , then they are not endpoints of any
P -basic interval). We want to show that all the entries of v are ﬁnite. Since g is
monotone with slope of absolute value λ on each ψ(P )-basic interval, we have

|g(ψ(I))| = λ|ψ(I)|,

I ∈ B(P ),

(3)
where if one side of the equality is inﬁnite then so is the other. Let F denote the
collection of all P -basic intervals I such that |ψ(I)| = ∞. If I ∈ F and if f (J) ⊇ I,
then by the conjugacy of f , g and by equation (3), it follows that J ∈ F . Now invoke
topological transitivity and the Markov condition, and it follows that either F = ∅
or F = B(P ).
Suppose toward contradiction that F = B(P ). Then there are neighborhoods of
±∞ on which g is aﬃne with constant slope λ > 1. It follows that at least one of
the points ±∞ is an attracting ﬁxed point, or else they form an attracting two-cycle
(slope larger than 1 in a neighborhood of inﬁnity means that the images of points
close to inﬁnity are even closer to inﬁnity). This contradicts transitivity. We may
conclude that F = ∅ and all entries of v are ﬁnite.

We still need to show that v is an eigenvector for T . Applying equation (3) we have

λvI = λ|ψ(I)| = |g(ψ(I))| = |ψ(f (I))| = XJ⊂f (I)

|ψ(J)| = XJ∈B(P )

TIJ vJ .

(cid:3)

Now we begin the long work of proving the suﬃciency of condition (2) in The-
orem 3.1. Let f , T , be as in the statement of the theorem, ﬁx λ > 1, and sup-
pose T v = λv for some nonzero vector v = (vI) ∈ RB(P ) with nonnegative entries.
We will assume (by Remark 3.4) that f ∈ CPMM[0,1]. We will construct a map

The set Q is backward invariant by construction and forward invariant because
P is forward invariant. Q is a dense subset of [0, 1] because f is mixing. Choose a
basepoint p0 ∈ P and deﬁne ψ on Q by the formula

∞[i=0

The choice of p0 is somewhat arbitrary, but to simplify the proof of Lemma 4.3 (v),
we insist that 0 < p0 < 1 and that p0 is an endpoint of some P -basic interval (i.e.,
p0 is not a 2-sided accumulation point of P ). This is possible because P is a closed,
countable subset of [0, 1] and hence cannot be perfect.

Remark 4.2. In light of equation (4), we ﬁnd that we are constructing a map g on

• a ﬁnite interval [a, b], if P vI < ∞,
• an extended half-line [a,∞], if PI<p0
• an extended half-line [−∞, b], ifPl<p0
• the extended real line [−∞,∞], ifPl<p0
Lemma 4.3. The function ψ : Q → [−∞,∞] has the following properties:
(i) ψ is well-deﬁned; i.e. when x ∈ Pn1 and x ∈ Pn2, the sums agree.
(ii) ψ is strictly monotone increasing.
(iii) If x, x′ ∈ Q belong to an interval of monotonicity of f , then

= ∞.

|ψ(f (x)) − ψ(f (x′))| = λ|ψ(x) − ψ(x′)|,

where if one side of the equality is inﬁnite, then so is the other.

(iv) For arbitrary x, x′ ∈ Q we have

|ψ(f (x)) − ψ(f (x′))| ≤ λ|ψ(x) − ψ(x′)|,

and we allow for the possibility that one or both sides of this inequality are
inﬁnite.

(v) For 0 < x < 1, ψ(x) is ﬁnite.

Proof.

This shows that ψ is well-deﬁned.

(ii) We will use the nonnegativity of the eigenvector v together with the mixing
hypothesis to show that the entries of v must be strictly positive. Strict mono-
tonicity of ψ then follows from the deﬁnition. Since v is not the zero vec-

vI = λ−nPJ(T n)IJ vJ ≥ λ−nvI0 > 0.
(iii) For x, x′ ∈ Q there exists a common value n ≥ 1 such that x, x′ ∈ Pn (since
P0 ⊂ P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ · · · ). Then f (x), f (x′) ∈ Pn−1. By the monotonicity of f
between x, x′, the assignment K = f (J) deﬁnes a bijective correspondence
{J ∈ B(Pn) : J between x, x′} ←→ {K ∈ B(Pn−1) : K between f (x), f (x′)} .
By the deﬁnition of ψ we may sum over those sets and obtain

|ψ(f (x)) − ψ(f (x′))| =XK

λ−(n−1)vf n−1(K) =

λ−(n−1)vf n−1(f (J)) = λ|ψ(x) − ψ(x′)|.

(iv) This is the inequality that survives from (iii) when we allow for folding between
x and x′. To see it, we imitate the proof of (iii), noticing that by the interme-
diate value theorem the assignment K = f (J) attains every interval K between
f (x), f (x′) at least once.

(v) Let x be given, 0 < x < 1. Assume x < p0; the proof when x > p0 is similar. Fix
a P -basic interval J0 with p0 at one endpoint. Because f is mixing, there exists
n such that J0 ∩ f−n((p0, 1)) 6= ∅ and J0 ∩ f−n((0, x)) 6= ∅. By the intermediate
value theorem there exist x1, x2 ∈ J0 with f n(x1) = x and f n(x2) = p0. By (iv)
applied n times, |ψ(x)| ≤ λn|ψ(x2) − ψ(x1)|. But by (ii), |ψ(x2) − ψ(x1)| ≤
|ψ(sup J0) − ψ(inf J0)|. At the two endpoints of J0, ψ takes the ﬁnite values 0
and vJ0 (or possibly −vJ0).

(cid:3)

The main problem to tackle before we can extend ψ to the desired homeomorphism

is to show that the map we have deﬁned so far has no jump discontinuities.
Problem 4.4. Show that for each x ∈ [0, 1],

inf ψ(Q ∩ (x, 1]) = sup ψ(Q ∩ [0, x)),

except that for x = 0 we write ψ(0) in place of the supremum and for x = 1 we write
ψ(1) in place of the inﬁmum.

The resolution of this problem makes essential use of the global continuity of f
as well as the order structure of the interval [0, 1]. Moreover, special treatment is
required for the points x ∈ Q – we must show the continuity of ψ from each side
separately. We do this by introducing a notion of “half-points.” 2

2It is a slight modiﬁcation of the construction from [6]. However, really the idea goes back to the
International Mathematical Olympiad in 1965, where the Polish team was making jokes about the
half-points [a, a) and (a, a].

5. Half-Points

˜Q = (Q × {+,−}) \ {(0,−), (1, +)}, S = ([0, 1] \ Q) ∪ ˜Q

The way to think of this deﬁnition is that we are splitting each point x ∈ Q into
the two half-points (x, +) and (x,−). S is the interval [0, 1] with each point of Q
replaced by half-points. We use boldface notation to represent points in S, whether
half or whole. Thus, x may mean x or (x, +) or (x,−), depending on the context.
Let us extend the dynamics of f from [0, 1] to S. Recall that Q is both forward
and backward invariant. On S \ ˜Q = [0, 1]\ Q we keep the map f without change. To
extend f from Q to ˜Q we deﬁne a notion of the orientation of the map at half-points.
We say that f is orientation-preserving (resp. orientation-reversing) at the half-point
(x, +) if some half-neighborhood [x, x + ε) is contained in some J ∈ B(P ) with f|J
increasing (resp. decreasing). For a half-point (x,−), the deﬁnition is the same,
except that we look at a half-neighborhood of the form (x − ε, x]. It is not clear how
to decide if f is orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing at the accumulation
points of P . It may happen that every half-neighborhood of x contains f (x) in the
interior of its image, so that neither deﬁnition is appropriate. Nevertheless, we deﬁne
the extended map f on ˜Q by the following formula:

(5)

f (x, +) =

f (x,−) =


(f (x), +),
(f (x),−),
(f (x), +),
(f (x),−),
(f (x), +),
(f (x),−),
(f (x), +),
(f (x),−),

if f is orientation-preserving at (x, +)
if f is orientation-reversing at (x, +)
if ∀ε>0 ∃x′∈P∩[x,x+ε) f (x′) > f (x)
otherwise
if f is orientation-reversing at (x,−)
if f is orientation-preserving at (x,−)
if ∀ε>0 ∃x′∈P∩(x−ε,x] f (x′) > f (x)
otherwise

Let us say a few words about the “otherwise” cases. Consider a half-point (x, +)
which does not ﬁt into any of the ﬁrst three cases. We claim that for such a
point, ∀ε>0 ∃x′∈P∩[x,x+ε) f (x′) < f (x).
If not, we would have to conclude that
∃ε>0 ∀x′∈P∩[x,x+ε) f (x′) = f (x). But this is impossible, because the half-neighborhood
[x, x + ε) must contain some P -basic interval J, and by the strict monotonicity of
f|J the two endpoints of this interval have distinct images. Similarly, if a half-point
(x,−) falls into the “otherwise” case, then ∀ε>0 ∃x′∈P∩(x−ε,x] f (x′) < f (x). This is
relevant in the proofs of Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2.

Now we deﬁne a real-valued function ∆ψ on S by the formula

∆ψ(x) =


inf ψ(Q ∩ (x, 1]) − ψ(x)
ψ(x) − sup ψ(Q ∩ [0, x))
inf ψ(Q ∩ (x, 1]) − sup ψ(Q ∩ [0, x))

if x = (x, +) ∈ ˜Q
if x = (x,−) ∈ ˜Q
if x = x ∈ S \ ˜Q

If ∆ψ(x) > 0, then we say that x is an atom for ψ and ∆ψ(x) is its mass. In this

language, Problem 4.4 asks us to show that ψ has no atoms.

The next lemma is an analog of Lemma 4.3 (iii) for a single point (or half-point) x.
We introduced half-points for the purpose of proving this lemma even at the folding
points of f .
Lemma 5.1. Let x ∈ S. Then ∆ψ(f (x)) = λ∆ψ(x).
Proof. Consider ﬁrst the case when x = x is a whole-point, i.e. x ∈ S \ ˜Q. Then x
belongs to the interior of some P -basic interval J. We may choose a sequence yi in
Q ∩ J converging to x from the left-hand side, and a sequence zi in Q ∩ J converging
to x from the right-hand side. Then f (yi) and f (zi) are sequences in Q converging
to f (x) from opposite sides. By the monotonicity of ψ and the deﬁnition of ∆ψ we
have |ψ(zi) − ψ(yi)| → ∆ψ(x) and |ψ(f (zi)) − ψ(f (yi))| → ∆ψ(f (x)). Since J is an
interval of monotonicity of f , the result follows from Lemma 4.3 (iii).
Now consider the case when x = (x, +) or x = (x,−), and suppose an appropriate
half-neighborhood of x is contained in a single P -basic interval J so that f is either
orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing at x. We may repeat the proof from
the previous case, with one modiﬁcation. If x = (x, +), then we take yi to be instead
the constant sequence with each member equal to x. If x = (x,−), then we take zi
to be instead the constant sequence with each member equal to x. Then the rest of
the proof holds as written.

Now consider the case when x = (x, +) and f (x) = (f (x), +), but every half-
neighborhood [x, x + ε) meets P . We will show in this case that ∆ψ(x) and ∆ψ(f (x))
are both zero. Choose points zi ∈ P which converge monotonically to x from the
right and such that each f (zi) > f (x). By continuity, f (zi) → f (x), and after passing
to a subsequence, we may assume that this convergence is also monotone. Now we
calculate ∆ψ(x) using the sequence zi and appealing back to the deﬁnition of ψ.

x and zi there is exactly one j ≥ i such that J lies between zj+1 and zj. But by
Lemma 4.3 (v), when i = 1 we have already a convergent series. Thus, when we
sum smaller and smaller tails of the series, we obtain 0 in the limit. We may apply
exactly the same argument to compute ∆ψ(f (x)) along the sequence f (zi), because
these points also belong to the invariant set P and decrease monotonically to f (x).
There are three other cases in which every appropriate half-neighborhood of x
meets P ; again in each of these cases ∆ψ(x) = 0 and ∆ψ(f (x)) = 0 by similar
arguments.
(cid:3)

The next lemma shows that the intermediate value theorem respects our deﬁnition

of half-points.

Lemma 5.2. Let x1 < x2 be any two points in [0, 1], not necessarily in Q, and let
k ∈ N. Suppose that there exists a point y ∈ S with y strictly between f k(x1) and
f k(x2). Then there exists x ∈ S with x between x1 and x2 such that f k(x) = (y).
Proof. If y = y ∈ S \ ˜Q, we just apply the invariance of Q and the usual inter-
mediate value theorem. If y ∈ ˜Q, then we consider the set A = [x1, x2] ∩ f−k(y).

It is nonempty by the usual intermediate value theorem, compact by the continu-
ity of f k, and contained in Q by the invariance of Q. Suppose ﬁrst that f k(x1) <
If x′ satisﬁes x1 < x′ < min A, then f k(x′) < y by the usual interme-
f k(x2).
It follows that f k(min A,−) =

(y,−). Similarly, f k(max A, +) = (y, +). Thus x may be taken as one of the points
(min A,−), (max A, +). The proof when f k(x1) > f k(x2) is similar, except that
f k(min A,−) = (y, +) and f k(max A, +) = (y,−).

(cid:3)

Now we are ready to solve Problem 4.4.

6. No Atoms

Lemma 6.1. ψ has no atoms; that is, ∆ψ is identically zero.
Proof. Assume toward contradiction that there is a point b ∈ S such that ∆ψ(b) > 0.
For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , let bn := f n(b) ∈ S and denote the corresponding point in [0, 1]
by bn. We denote the orbit of b by Orb(b) = {b0, b1, b2, . . .}. By Lemma 5.1,
(6)
and this grows to ∞ because λ > 1.
If Orb(b) has an accumulation point in the
open interval (0, 1), then the increment of ψ across a small neighborhood of this
accumulation point is ∞, contradicting Lemma 4.3 (v) and we are done. Henceforth,
we may assume that the orbit of b only accumulates at (one or both) endpoints of
[0, 1]. Consider ﬁrst the case when Orb(b) accumulates at only one endpoint of [0, 1],
and assume without loss of generality that limn→∞ bn = 1.

∆ψ(bn) = λn∆ψ(b), n ∈ N

Since f is mixing, it must have a ﬁxed point w with 0 < w < 1. Since bn → 1,
it follows that bn > w for all suﬃciently large n. Thus, after replacing b and b with
their appropriate images, we may assume that bn > w for all n ∈ N. Equation (6)
continues to hold, and it follows that b is not a ﬁxed point for f , so b 6= 1.

Now consider the following claim:

(⋆) For all N ∈ N there exist n > N and a ∈ S

such that a /∈ Orb(b), f (a) = bn, and w < a < bn+1.
The proof of claim (⋆) proceeds in two cases. First, assume that bN < bN +1 <
bN +2 < . . .; i.e., starting from time N, the orbit of b moves monotonically to the
right. Since f is mixing, the interval [bN +1, 1] cannot be invariant, so there must exist
c > bN +1 with f (c) < bN +1. Take n = max{i : bi < c}. Clearly n > N. The relevant
ordering of points is bn−1 < bn < c < bn+1. Since f (bn) > bn and f (c) < bn, it follows
by Lemma 5.2 that there exists a with a between bn and c such that f (a) = bn.
Clearly, a 6= bn−1. It follows that a /∈ Orb(b). Moreover, w < a < bn+1.
The remaining case is that there exists i ≥ N such that bi+1 < bi; i.e., at some
time later than N, the orbit moves to the left. But our orbit is converging to the
right-hand endpoint of [0, 1], so it cannot go on moving to the left forever. Let
n = min{j > i : bj+1 > bj}. We have n > N, and the relevant ordering of points is
bn−1 > bn and bn+1 > bn. Since f (w) < bn and f (bn) > bn, it follows by Lemma 5.2
that there exists a with a between w and bn such that f (a) = bn. Again, we see that
a 6= bn−1, so a /∈ Orb(b). Finally, a < bn+1. This concludes the proof of claim (⋆).

CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

11

Now we apply claim (⋆) recursively to ﬁnd inﬁnitely many distinct atoms between w
and b, each with the same positive mass. At stage 1, ﬁnd n1 and a1 with a1 /∈ Orb(b)
such that f (a1) = bn1 and w < a1 < bn1+1. Now we apply Lemma (5.2) to f n1+1 to
ﬁnd x1 with x1 between w and b such that f n1+1(x1) = a1. Then f n1+2(x1) = bn1,
so by applying Lemma 5.1 and equation (6) we have ∆ψ(x1) = λ−(n1+2)∆ψ(bn1) =
λ−2∆ψ(b). The point x1 will serve as the ﬁrst of inﬁnitely many points between w
and b at which ψ has this particular increment. At stage i, set N = ni−1 and apply
claim (⋆) to ﬁnd ni and ai with ni > ni−1. Again, we can ﬁnd xi with xi between w
and b and f ni+1(xi) = ai, whence ∆ψ(xi) = λ−2∆ψ(b) as before. It remains to check
that the points {xi} are distinct. Observe that f ni+1(xi) = ai does not belong to the
invariant set Orb(b), whereas f ni+2(xi) = bni ∈ Orb(b). By construction, the numbers
{ni} are all distinct. Thus, the points {xi} are distinguished from one another by the
time required to make ﬁrst entrance into Orb(b).
Now we use our atoms to produce a contradiction. By Lemma 4.3 (v), the increment
ψ(b)−ψ(w) is ﬁnite. Choose an integer n large enough that nλ−2∆ψ(b) > ψ(b)−ψ(w).
Consider the points x1, x2, . . . , xn, and let δ be the minimum distance between two
adjacent points of the set {w, b} ∪ {x1, x2, . . . , xn}. For each i = 1, . . . , n there exist
yi, zi ∈ Q with yi < xi < zi and max{zi − xi, xi − yi} < δ/2. Then ψ(zi) − ψ(yi) ≥
λ−2∆ψ(b). By the monotonicity of ψ,

ψ(b) − ψ(w) ≥

n

Xi=1

ψ(zi) − ψ(yi) > nλ−2∆ψ(b) > ψ(b) − ψ(w).

This is a contradiction; in words, we cannot have inﬁnitely many atoms between w
and b all having the same positive mass when the total increment of ψ between w
and b is ﬁnite. This completes the proof in the case that Orb(b) accumulates at only
one endpoint of [0, 1].

Finally, let us say a few words about the case when Orb(b) accumulates at both
endpoints of [0, 1].
In this case, f (0) = 1 and f (1) = 0 by continuity. Again by
continuity, for suﬃciently large n the points bn belong alternately to a small neigh-
borhood of 0 and a small neighborhood of 1. Thus, the subsequence b2n accumulates
only on a single endpoint of [0, 1]. The map f 2 is again topologically mixing. It is
straightforward, then, to modify the above proof to deal with this case, by working
along the subsequence b2n and writing f 2 and λ2 in place of f and λ.
(cid:3)

7. The Rest of the Proof of Theorem 3.1

Having resolved Problem 4.4, we are ready to ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 3.1.

Proof. It remains to show that condition (2) is suﬃcient. We have deﬁned on the dense
subset Q ⊂ [0, 1] a strictly monotone map ψ : Q → [−∞,∞]. In light of Lemma 6.1,
the formula ψ(x) = sup ψ(Q∩ [0, x)) = inf ψ(Q∩ (x, 1]) gives a well-deﬁned extension
ψ : [0, 1] → [−∞,∞]. Strict monotonicity of the extension follows from the strict
monotonicity of ψ|Q and the density of Q. We claim that the extended function ψ is
continuous. It suﬃces to verify for each x that ψ(x) = limy→x− ψ(y) = limz→x+ ψ(z).
By monotonicity of ψ and the density of Q we may evaluate these one-sided limits
using points y, z ∈ Q, and by our deﬁnition of the extended map ψ the claim follows.

12

MICHA L MISIUREWICZ AND SAMUEL ROTH

Finally, from strict monotonicity and continuity, it follows that ψ : [0, 1] → [−∞,∞]
is a homeomorphism onto its image.
Deﬁne a map g : ψ([0, 1]) → ψ([0, 1]) by the composition g := ψ ◦ f ◦ ψ−1. It is
countably piecewise monotone and Markov with respect to ψ(P ). If y = ψ(x) and
y′ = ψ(x′) belong to a single ψ(P )-basic interval, then x and x′ belong to an interval
of monotonicity of f . By Lemma 4.3 (iii) and the density of Q we may conclude that
|g(y) − g(y′)| = λ|y − y′|. This shows that g has constant slope λ.
(cid:3)

8. Constant Slope on the Interval

We present now a map f : [0, 1] → [0, 1], f ∈ CPMM, with the following lin-
earizability properties. For any λ ≥ λmin, where λmin is the positive real root of
λ3 − 2λ2 − λ − 2 (approximately 2.66), there is a map g : [0, 1] → [0, 1] of constant
slope λ conjugate to f . Moreover, the topological entropy of f is equal to log λmin.
However, f is not conjugate to any map of constant slope on the extended real line or
the extended half line. This sharply illustrates the point that for countably piecewise
monotone maps, constant slope gives only an upper bound for topological entropy.

Bobok and Soukenka [4] have constructed a map with similar linearizability prop-
erties, that is, with entropy log 9 and with conjugate maps of every constant slope
λ ≥ 9. However, their example exhibits transient Markov dynamics [3], whereas our
map f exhibits strongly positive recurrent Markov dynamics (in the sense of the Vere-
Jones recurrence hierarchy for countable Markov chains, see [10, 12]). We regard this
as evidence that the existence of constant slope models for a given map is in some part
independent of the recurrence properties of the associated Markov dynamics (but see
the discussion at the beginning of section 10).

To construct the map f , we subdivide the interval [0, 1] into countably many subin-

tervals {Ai}∞i=0, {Bi}∞i=0, {Ci}∞i=0, and D, ordered from left to right as follows:
D < C0 < C1 < C2 < . . . < xf ixed < . . . < B2 < A2 < B1 < A1 < B0 < A0.

We specify the lengths of the intervals Ai, Bi, Ci, D to be equal (respectively) to the
numbers ai, bi, ci, d given in equation (12) below, taking λ = λmin. The partition P
consists of the endpoints of these intervals together with their (unique) accumulation
point, which we denote xf ixed and set as a ﬁxed point for f . We prescribe for f the
following Markov dynamics:

f (D) = [0, 1],

f (C0) = D,

Moreover, we prescribe that our map will increase linearly on each of the intervals
Ai, Ci, and decrease linearly on each of the intervals Bi, D. This completes the
deﬁnition of f ; we present its graph in Figure 2. As we will see, the lengths we chose
for the P -basic intervals comprise an eigenvector for the Markov transition matrix
with eigenvalue λmin. Thus, by construction, f has constant slope λ = λmin > 2.
This allows us to verify that f is topologically mixing. Indeed, let U, V be a pair of

f (Ai) =  ∞[j=i+1
f (Bi) =  ∞[j=i+2

Aj! ∪  ∞[j=i+1
Aj! ∪  ∞[j=i+2

arbitrary open intervals. The iterated images f n(U) grow in size until some image
contains an entire P -basic interval (any interval which does not contain an entire
P -basic interval is folded by f in at most one place, so that its image grows by a
factor of at least λmin/2 > 1, and such growth cannot continue indeﬁnitely in a ﬁnite
length state space). Consulting the Markov transition diagram in Figure 3, we see
that the union of images of any given P -basic interval includes all P -basic intervals
and therefore intersects the open set V .

λai = P∞j=i+1 aj +P∞j=i+1 bj +P∞j=i cj
λbi = P∞j=i+2 aj +P∞j=i+2 bj +P∞j=i cj
λd = P∞j=0 aj +P∞j=0 bj +P∞j=0 cj + d

where ai, bi, ci, and d represent the entries corresponding to the intervals Ai, Bi, Ci,
and D, respectively, and λ represents the eigenvalue. We subtract the ﬁrst equation
of (7) with index i + 1 from the ﬁrst equation with index i to obtain

(7)

(8)

Then we subtract the ﬁrst equation of (7) with index i + 2 from the second equation
with index i + 1 to obtain

λ(ai − ai+1) = ai+1 + bi+1 + ci.

(9)

bi+1 = ai+2 + λ−1ci+1.

Substituting (9) into (8), applying the third equation from (7) to express all ci’s in
terms of c0, and rearranging terms, we obtain

(10)

0 = ai+2 + (λ + 1)ai+1 − λai + λ−i(1 + λ−2)c0

This equation deﬁnes a nonhomogeneous, constant-coeﬃcient linear recurrence re-
lation on the terms ai. The theory of linear recurrence equations tells us that the
general solution to (10) is

where α and β are arbitrary constants and x+, x− are the positive and negative
solutions of the characteristic equation x2 + (λ + 1)x − λ = 0 (they are real because
λ > 0). Observe that the terms ci grow exponentially with rate λ−1, and from the ﬁrst
equation of (7) we have P∞i=0 ci < λa0 < ∞. It follows that λ > 1. Now of the three
exponential terms in (11), the base with the greatest modulus is x− < −1. It follows
that we must take β = 0 to achieve nonnegativity of the terms ai. For λ between 1
and the real root of λ3−λ2−λ−1 we have simultaneously (miracle) that λ−1 > x+ and
that the coeﬃcient of the λ−i term is negative. Nonnegativity of the terms ai forces
us to consider only λ greater than the real root of λ3 − λ2 − λ − 1, and henceforward
we may assume that λ3 − λ2 − λ − 1 > 0 and (what is equivalent) that x+ > λ−1.
Now that we are equipped with equations (9), (11), and the third equation of (7), we
are able to sum the geometric series in the ﬁfth equation of (7), which gives us that
α = x+λ(λ3−2λ2−λ−2)
c0. Again, we invoke nonnegativity of the terms ai to conclude
that λ must be greater than or equal to the real root of λ3 − 2λ2 − λ − 2, which is
approximately 2.66. Combining all of our results so far, using the equality x++1
x+−1 = λ
,
x+
and choosing a scaling constant to clear all denominators, we have that any solution
to the system (7) must be of the form

λ3−λ2−λ−1

λ ∈ [λmin,∞), λmin = the real solution of λ3 − 2λ2 − λ − 2 = 0
x = the positive solution of x2 + (λ + 1)x − λ = 0
α = xλ(λ3 − 2λ2 − λ − 2)
ai = αxi + (λ2 + 1)λ−i
bi = αxi+1 + (λ2 − 1)λ−i
ci = (λ3 − λ2 − λ − 1)λ−i
d = (λ3 − λ2 − λ − 1)λ

Conversely, we can verify that equation (12) does indeed deﬁne a nonnegative solu-
tion to (7). This completes our eigenvector analysis. In light of Theorem 3.1 this
establishes our claims about the existence of constant slope maps conjugate to f for
each λ ≥ λmin.
It is worth noting that the transition matrix T cannot have unsummable nonneg-
ative eigenvectors for the simple reason that the P -basic interval D contains in its
image all P -basic intervals, so that the sum of the entries of any eigenvector must be
λ · d < ∞.
Next, we wish to argue that the topological entropy of f is equal to log λmin.
We begin by recalling the necessary facts from the theory of transitive countable
Markov chains. The Perron value λM of a transitive, countable state Markov chain
is deﬁned [11] by λM = lim(p(n)
uu denotes the number of length n loops
in the chain’s transition graph which start and end at a ﬁxed, arbitrary vertex u;
the limit is independent of the choice of u.
uu count
only the length n ﬁrst-return loops, which start and end at the vertex u but do not
visit u at any intermediate time. It may happen that Φu := lim sup(f (n)
uu )1/n < λM
for some vertex u; then the same inequality holds for every vertex u and the chain is
called strongly positive recurrent [10, Deﬁnition 2.3 and Theorem 2.7]. Moreover, [10,
Proposition 2.4] gives the following equivalence, which allows us to detect strongly

u > 1.

Strongly positive recurrent chains are a special case of recurrent chains, for which
the Perron value is known to be equal to the minimum of the set of eigenvalues for
nonnegative eigenvectors [9, Theorem 2]. The connection to interval maps is given
by [3, Proposition 7], which says that the entropy of a topologically mixing countably
piecewise monotone and Markov map is given by the logarithm of the Perron value
of the corresponding Markov chain.

Consider now the countable state topological Markov chain associated to our par-
ticular map f with its given Markov partition. The transition diagram of this chain
is shown in Figure 3. Denoting its Perron value by λM and applying the results of the
preceding paragraph, we have htop(f ) = log λM . To show that λM = λmin, it suﬃces
to count ﬁrst return paths and prove that the chain is strongly positive recurrent.

Figure 3. The transition diagram.

Let f (n) denote the number of ﬁrst return paths of length n from the vertex
D to itself. To compute these numbers, we organize the collection of all ﬁrst re-
turn paths from D to itself as follows. Using the convention D = C−1, we ﬁnd
(see Figure 3) that each ﬁrst return path may be written uniquely in the form
DxCnCn−1 · · · C0D, where x is a string (perhaps empty) consisting only of A’s and
B’s and n ≥ −1.
in the string x is not Bn, then we de-
clare that DxCnCn−1 · · · C0D has three descendants, namely, DxCn+1Cn · · · C0D,
DxAn+1Cn+1Cn · · · C0D, and DxBn+1Cn+1Cn · · · C0D. But if the ﬁnal symbol in
the string x is Bn, then we declare that DxCnCn−1 · · · C0D has only one descendant,
namely, DxCn+1Cn · · · C0D. This relationship organizes the set of ﬁrst return paths
into a tree (Figure 4), in which each ﬁrst return path traces a unique ancestry back
to the shortest ﬁrst return path DD. Moreover, we may organize this tree into levels,
corresponding to the lengths of the ﬁrst return paths.

If the ﬁnal symbol

Looking again at Figure 4, we see that the problem of computing the growth rate
of the numbers f (n) is the same as computing the growth rate of a population of

gives birth to a white rabbit on its ﬁrst birthday and to twin white and black rabbits
on its second birthday, whereas a black rabbit gives birth to a white rabbit on its
ﬁrst birthday and no additional rabbits. Thus, the sub-population of white rabbits
is growing according to the recurrence relation w(n+3) = w(n+2) + w(n+1) + w(n), while
the total population at generation n is f (n) = w(n) + w(n−2). This yields the closed

conjugates with modulus less than 1. Now the simple observation that w(3) > w(2)
gives us that α 6= 0, and therefore we obtain the limit (f (n))1/n → x1. However, the
sum P f (n)x−n
diverges, because the terms f (n)x−n
are converging to the nonzero
constant α(1 + x−2

9. Constant Slope on the Extended Real Line and Half Line

We present now a map f : [0, 1] → [0, 1], f ∈ CPMM, with the following lineariz-
ability properties. It is conjugate to maps of constant slope λ on the extended real
line (respectively, extended half line) for every λ ≥ 2 +√5 (respectively, λ > 2 +√5).
First, deﬁne a map F : R → R as the piecewise aﬃne “connect-the-dots” map
with “dots” at (k, k − 1), (k + b, k + b + 1), k ∈ Z, where b = (√5 − 1)/2; it is
piecewise monotone and Markov with respect to the set {k, k + b : k ∈ Z}, and it has
constant slope 2 + √5. Moreover, ﬁx a homeomorphism h : (0, 1) → R; if we wish

CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

17

to be concrete, we may take h(x) = ln(x/(1 − x)). Let f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be the map
h−1 ◦ F ◦ h with additional ﬁxed points at 0, 1. Then f is piecewise monotone and
Markov with respect to the set P = {0, 1} ∪ {h−1(k), h−1(k + b) : k ∈ Z}. Figure 5
shows the graphs of F and f together with their Markov partitions.

Figure 5. The constant slope map F : R → R and the conjugate map
f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] with ﬁxed points at 0, 1.
We enumerate the P -basic intervals as follows:

I2k = [h−1(k), h−1(k + b)],
The Markov transitions are given by

We must verify that f is mixing. Let U, V be any pair of nonempty open intervals.
We may assume that the points 0, 1 do not belong to U or V . Passing through the
conjugacy, we may work instead with the map F and the intervals h(U), h(V ). Each
iterated image of h(U) that contains at most one folding point of F is expanded in
length by a factor of at least 1
contains an entire h(P )-basic interval. The Markov transitions are such that the
iterated images of an arbitrary basic interval eventually include any other given basic
interval. This establishes the mixing property.

2(2 + √5) > 1. Therefore some iterated image of h(U)

Let T be the 0-1 transition matrix for the map f and the partition set P . In light
of Theorem 3.1, we wish to ﬁnd all nonnegative solutions v ∈ RB(P ), λ > 1 to the
equation T v = λv. Comparing equation (15) with the deﬁnition of T , we are looking
for all nonnegative solutions to the inﬁnite system of equations

We may regard the matrix Mλ as deﬁning a dynamical system on R2. Then the entries
of v are the orbit of the initial point (vI1, vI2). To obtain nonnegative entries for v,
we must choose the initial point so that the whole orbit (both forward and backward)
remains in the ﬁrst quadrant. We can solve this problem using the elementary theory
of linear transformations on R2. There are 3 cases we must consider – they are

If 1 < λ < 2 + √5, then the eigenvalues of Mλ are complex conjugates and Mλ
“rotates” R2 about the origin.
In this case, no orbit stays in the ﬁrst quadrant.
The diligent reader may verify the implications vI1 ≥ vI2 ≥ 0 =⇒ vI4 < 0 and
vI2 ≥ vI1 ≥ 0 =⇒ vI−1 < 0.
If λ = 2 + √5, then Mλ has unique real eigenvalue 1 with algebraic multiplicity
2 and geometric multiplicity 1. Thus, Mλ acts as a shear on R2 parallel to a line of
ﬁxed points (corresponding to the unique eigenvector of Mλ). The only way to obtain
a whole orbit in the ﬁrst quadrant is to choose the initial point (vI1, vI2) from the line
of ﬁxed points. This yields (up to a scalar multiple) the unique nonnegative solution

vI2k+1 = √5 − 1,

vI2k = 2,

(18)
Applying Theorem 3.1, we recover (up to scaling, and with ﬁxed points at ±∞) the
constant slope map F which started our whole discussion.
If λ > 2 + √5, then Mλ has distinct positive, real eigenvalues whose product is 1.
There are distinct eigenvectors in the ﬁrst quadrant and the origin is a saddle ﬁxed

point. Any initial point (vI1, vI2) chosen between these eigendirections in the ﬁrst
quadrant yields an unsummable, nonnegative v. We can achieve unsummability of v
on one side or on both sides, according as we choose the initial point to lie on one
of these eigendirections or strictly between them. Accordingly, Theorem 3.1 yields a
constant slope map either on an extended half line or on the extended real line, (see
Remark 4.2).

10. No Constant Slope

We construct now a topologically mixing map f ∈ CPMM whose transition matrix
does not admit any nonnegative eigenvectors, summable or otherwise. That means
that f is not conjugate to any map of any constant slope, even allowing for maps on
the extended real line. In terms of the Vere-Jones recurrence hierarchy, our map f
has transient Markov dynamics. Indeed it must, since for recurrent Markov chains
there always exists a nonnegative eigenvector (see [12]). For transient Markov chains,
Pruitt [9] oﬀers a nice criterion for the existence or nonexistence of a nonnegative
eigenvector; our example was inspired by Pruitt’s paper. Other examples of this type
are considered in the forthcoming article [3].

We construct f as follows. Fix a subset N ⊂ N, 1 /∈ N, such that π(n)
n → 0, and
P∞n=0 3−π(n) < 3, where π(n) = #N∩{1, 2, . . . , n}, π(0) = 0. If we wish to be explicit,
we may take N such that {π(n)}∞n=0 is the sequence 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, . . . .
Subdivide [0, 1] into adjacent intervals In = (cid:2) 1
2n(cid:3), n ≥ 0. Let f : [0, 1] → [0, 1]
be the continuous, piecewise aﬃne map with the following properties. For n ∈ N, f
maps In onto In−1 once with slope +2. For n ∈ N \ N f maps In onto In−1 three
times with alternating slopes ±6. Finally, f maps I0 onto the whole space [0, 1] with
slope −2. The idea is illustrated in Figure 10; the choice of N controls which windows
contain only one branch of monotonicity.

We wish to use Theorem 3.1, and therefore we must verify that f is topologi-
cally mixing. Let U be an arbitrary open interval. If an interval is mapped forward
monotonically by f , then its image is an interval of at least twice the length. There-
fore, there is some minimal n0 such that f n0(U) contains a folding point of f . Then
f n0+1(U) contains a point of the form 2−n1. Thus, f n0+n1+2(U) contains a neighbor-
hood of zero, and hence a whole interval In2. Then f n0+n1+n2+3(U) = [0, 1]. This
shows that f is topologically mixing (and even locally eventually onto).

We investigate now the existence of nonnegative eigenvectors for the corresponding
transition matrix. Suppose that there is an eigenvector with some eigenvalue λ > 0.
Let vn denote the sum of the entries corresponding to I 1
n, and let v0 denote
the entry corresponding to the undivided interval I0. Then the eigenvector condition
implies that

By rescaling our vector if necessary, we may suppose that v0 = 1. It follows inductively
. If λ ≥ 3, then P∞n=0 vn ≤ P∞n=0 3−π(n) < 3 by the choice of N,
that vn = 3n−π(n)
which contradicts the last equation of (19). If λ < 3, then vn → ∞ by the choice of N,
so that Pn vn diverges, which again contradicts (19). It follows that our transition
matrix has no nonnegative eigenvectors.
In light of Theorem 3.1, this means that
there does not exist any conjugate map of any constant slope, even allowing for maps
on the extended real line.

11. Piecewise Continuous Case

We turn our attention now to piecewise continuous maps. We ﬁnish the proof
of Theorem 3.2, showing by example the insuﬃciency of condition (2). We begin
by deﬁning two maps f , g on the extended half-line [0,∞] with the same Markov
structure. The P -basic intervals are the intervals Ai = (2i + 2i − 3, 2i+1 + 2i − 2),
Bi = (2i+1 + 2i − 2, 2i+1 + 2i − 1), i = 0, 1, 2, . . .; thus P is the set of endpoints of
these intervals together with the point at inﬁnity. Notice that these intervals have
lengths |Ai| = 2i + 1, |Bi| = 1 and are arranged from left to right in the order
A0 < B0 < A1 < B1 < A2 < B2 < . . .. Both maps f , g will exhibit Markov
transitions as indicated in Figure 8, where an arrow I → J indicates that the
image of interval I includes interval J. For each i, both g|Ai and g|Bi are aﬃne

with slope 2; this completes the deﬁnition of g. Moreover, for all i, f|Bi is aﬃne
with slope 2. However, the deﬁnition of f|Ai
is diﬀerent. For each i, f carries
(2i + 2i − 3, 2i+1 + 2i − 3) (all but the right-most unit of Ai) aﬃnely onto Bi with
slope 2−i, and carries (2i+1 + 2i − 3, 2i+1 + 2i − 2) (the right-most unit of Ai) aﬃnely

CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

onto Ai+1 with slope 2i+1 + 1. This completes the deﬁnition of f . The graphs of both
maps are shown below.

Figure 9. The graphs of the maps f and g.

We claim that the map f is topologically mixing. Indeed, let U, V ⊂ [0,∞] be any
open intervals. If for each i, f i(U) is contained in a single P -basic interval, then either
there are inﬁnitely many indices ij for which f ij (U) ⊂ A0 or there are only ﬁnitely
many (perhaps zero). The ﬁrst case is impossible because the length |f ij+1(U)| must
be greater than the length |f ij (U)| by a factor of at least 2 (consider all possible loops
from A0 to itself in Figure 8 and multiply slopes along the loop). The second case
is impossible because then some image of U must be contained in a set of the form
T∞k=0 f−k(An+k) for some n (look again at Figure 8). But the length of the ﬁnite
intersection TK
f−kAn+k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

k=0 f−k(An+k) is equal to the length of An times the proportion of An
mapped onto An+1, times the proportion of An+1 mapped onto An+2, and so on, up
to the proportion of An+K−1 mapped onto An+K, that is,

which decreases to zero as K → ∞. We conclude that there exists i such that f i(U)
is not contained in a single P -basic interval. Looking now at the graph of f , we can
see that either f i+1(U) or else f i+2(U) contains some interval (0, ε), and in particular,
contains some interval (0, 2−i′). Observe that f 2i′(0, 2−i′) = A0. Let i′′ be such that
V ∩ (Ai′′ ∪ Bi′′) 6= ∅. For all n ≥ i′′ + 3 we have f n(A0) ⊃ (Ai′′ ∪ Bi′′) (look again for
paths in Figure 8). Therefore, for all n ≥ i + 2 + 2i′ + i′′ + 3 we have f n(U) ∩ V 6= ∅.
This concludes the proof that f is topologically mixing.
Next we consider eigenvectors associated with the Markov structure of the map f .
We single out the eigenvalue λ = 2, and we denote by ai, bi, i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the entries

22

MICHA L MISIUREWICZ AND SAMUEL ROTH

of an eigenvector corresponding to the intervals Ai, Bi, i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., respectively. In
particular, we must ﬁnd nonnegative solutions to the inﬁnite system of equations

(cid:26) 2ai = bi + ai+1

2bi = a0

,

i ∈ N.

Since eigenvectors are deﬁned only up to a scaling constant, we are free to ﬁx b0 = 1.
It follows that a0 = 2 and that bi = 1 for all i. Then the entries ai can be computed
inductively as ai = 2i +1. Up to scaling, this is the only eigenvector for the eigenvalue
λ = 2.

Despite the existence of this eigenvector, f is not conjugate to any map of constant
slope 2. Indeed, let ϕ be a homeomorphism of [0,∞] onto a closed (sub)interval of
the extended real line; without loss of generality we may assume that ϕ is orientation-
preserving. Suppose that the conjugate map ϕ ◦ f ◦ ϕ−1 has constant slope 2. By
Lemma 4.1 the lengths of the ϕ(P )-basic intervals must be given by an eigenvector
with eigenvalue 2. Therefore, after rescaling and translating ϕ if necessary, the map
ϕ ◦ f ◦ ϕ−1 is equal to the map g which we have already deﬁned, so that ϕ(Ai) = Ai
and ϕ(Bi) = Bi for all i. In other words, ϕ ﬁxes the entire set P . Let xk denote the
left-hand endpoint of the interval A0 ∩ f−1(A1)∩ . . .∩ f−k(Ak), and let yk denote the
left-hand endpoint of the interval A0 ∩ g−1(A1) ∩ . . . ∩ g−k(Ak). Since ϕ conjugates
f with g, we must have ϕ(xk) = yk for all k. By the same reasoning as we used to
derive equation (20), we have

xk = 2 − 2 × 1
yk = 2 − 2 × 3
Inductively, yk = 2 − 2k+1
2k . We have xk → 2 and yk → 1. Since ϕ(2) = 2, this
contradicts the continuity of ϕ. We conclude that f is not conjugate to any map of
constant slope 2.

Remark 11.1. We can also interpret this example from the point of view of wan-
dering intervals. The map g has a wandering interval A0 ∩ g−1(A1) ∩ g−2(A2) ∩ · · · .
Thus, even though it has constant slope 2 and the right Markov structure, it cannot
be conjugate to the topologically mixing map f .

12. The Mixing Hypothesis

We turn our attention now to maps which are topologically transitive but not
topologically mixing. We ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 3.3, showing the insuﬃciency
of condition (2). We construct a map ˜f in CPMM which is topologically transitive
but not mixing. We give a nonnegative eigenvector v for the transition matrix T , but
prove that ˜f is not conjugate to any map on any subinterval [a, b] ⊂ [−∞,∞] with
constant slope equal to the eigenvalue of v.
Let f and P be as deﬁned in Section 9. We deﬁne ˜f : [−1, 1] → [−1, 1] by the

formula

˜f (x) =(−f (x),
−x

if x ∈ [0, 1]
if x ∈ [−1, 0]

This map ˜f is piecewise monotone and Markov with respect to the set ˜P = P ∪ −P .
Figure 10 shows the graph of ˜f (in bold). Superimposed is the graph of the second

CONSTANT SLOPE MAPS ON THE EXTENDED REAL LINE

iterate ˜f 2. By construction, ˜f 2|[0,1] and ˜f 2|[−1,0] are both isomorphic copies of the
map f . In this sense, ˜f is a kind of dynamical square root of f .

Figure 10. The map ˜f (shown in bold) is transitive but not mixing.
It’s second iterate (superimposed) consists of two copies of the map f
from Section 9 (compare with Figure 5).

We claim that ˜f is topologically transitive, but not topologically mixing. To see the
transitivity, take arbitrary nonempty open subsets U, V of [−1, 1]. After shrinking
these sets, we may assume that U, V are open intervals not containing 0. Consider
ﬁrst the case when U, V ⊂ [0, 1]. By the transitivity of f there exists n such that
U ∩ f−n(V ) 6= ∅, but then U ∩ ˜f−2n(V ) 6= ∅. The case when U, V ⊂ [−1, 0] is
similar. Now consider the case when U ⊂ [0, 1] and V ⊂ [−1, 0]. Using the reﬂected
set −V and the transitivity of f , ﬁnd n such that U ∩ f−n(−V ) 6= ∅. Then U ∩
˜f 2n−1(V ) 6= ∅. The case when U ⊂ [−1, 0] and V ⊂ [0, 1] is similar. This shows
topological transitivity of ˜f . To see that ˜f is not topologically mixing, notice that
the set {n ∈ N : (0, 1) ∩ ˜f−n(0, 1) 6= ∅} consists of only the even natural numbers.
Let ˜T be the 0-1 transition matrix for the map ˜f with respect to the Markov
partition by ˜P . We label the ˜P -basic intervals Ik, Jk, k ∈ Z, where the intervals Ik
are given by equation (14) and the intervals Jk are their reﬂections, Jk = −Ik. Fix
λ = 2 + √5. We ﬁnd all nonnegative solutions v ∈ RB( ˜P ) to the equation ˜T v = √λv.
In light of the Markov transitions, this is the inﬁnite system of equations

If we substitute the last line in equation (21) into the ﬁrst two lines, we recover
equation (16), which for λ = 2 +√5 has (up to scalar multiples) the unique nonnega-
tive solution (18). Therefore (21) has (up to scalar multiples) the unique nonnegative
solution

Now we show that despite the existence of this eigenvector v, there does not exist

[−1, 1] so that a small open interval (−ε, ε) contains inﬁnitely many P -basic intervals.
Thus, ψ(−ε, ε) has inﬁnite length. On the other hand, a nondecreasing homeomor-
phism ψ : [−1, 1] → [−∞,∞] must take ﬁnite values at every interior point of the
interval [−1, 1]. This is a contradiction.
