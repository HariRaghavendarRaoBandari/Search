Abstract. Using ﬁnite difference method, time evolution of a typical metal-molecule-
metal system is studied by introducing a new method to solve general related Volterra
integro−di f f erential equation (IDE). Discretization in time domain is applied for one
dimensional chain tight binding model in several cases by deﬁning a matrixintegro−
di f f erential equation (MIDE). Results are compatible with their analytical counter-
parts and show more accuracy than other numerical methods like Runge Kutta (RK).
Charge transport properties in a trans-polyacetylene chain are found by studying the
time evolution of charge density in it and current-voltage diagram is calculated.

Key words: time evolution, green function, molecular junction, ﬁnite difference method.

1 Introduction

Recently, Metal-Molecule-Metal (MMM) structures (Figure 1) have attracted scientists.
Their vast applications, include electrical, optical, mechanical, etc have led scientists to
produce devices with new abilities and have improved efﬁciencies relative to their pri-
mary counterparts [1–5]. Well predicting behaviour of MMM systems requires investi-
gating time-evolution of their transport properties. Many efforts have been done to inves-
tigate time dependence of transport properties in MMM structures. Generally, Green’s
function formalism and density functional theory, have extensively applied to study time
evolution of MMM structures [6–12]. In the Green’s function formalism, transport prop-
erties of MMM systems can be deduced by applying Green’s function in the energy rep-
resentation, G(E), which can be calculated as follows:

G(E) = [(E+i0+)I− H−Σ(E)]−1

In which H, Σ(E) and E are Hamiltonian of the molecule and self-energy of the system in
energy E, respectively. The Fourier transform of G(E), suggests impulse response (G(t))
as:

G(t) =

e −iEt

¯h G(E)dE

2π¯hZ ∞
−∞

which satisﬁes the Fourier transform of equation (1.1) as follows:

(i¯h

∂
∂t − H−Σ)G(t) = I δ(t)

(1.2)

(1.3)

Taking the energy dependence into account, the product of Σ and G becomes a convolu-
tion in time domain then equation (1.3) can be rewritten as [13]:

(i¯h

∂

∂t − H)G(t)−Z Σ(t−t′)G(t′)dt′ = I δ(t)

(1.4)

Equation (1.4) is a non-homogeneous Volterra IDE [14] with an intractable and time

consuming general solution process.

Finite difference method (FDM), is an applicable scheme to solve coupled equations
[15] and as will be mentioned in section ??, discretization of a differential equation results
some ones. This method has been used to study electronic transport in nanostructures,
for instance Khomyakov et. al. [16] have calculated coherent transport of a nano wire by
wave functions matching in the boundary zones connecting electrods and the scattering
region using FDM.

In this article, using FDM, a simple formalism is proposed to solve equation (1.4).
In this approach, derivative and integrator operators are deﬁned then equation (1.4) is
rewritten in matrix form in the presence of adequate boundary conditions (section ??).

In section ?? this approach is applied to calculate the Green’s function, G(t) for an
inﬁnite 1D chain. Results are calculated in both time-independent and time-dependent
Hamiltonian cases and are compared with their analytical solutions. Beside some numer-
ical comparisons are made between computational errors of our formalism and Dyson
series and RK methods. Finally, this method is used to calculate the charge current in a
system composed of a trans-polyacetylene molecule connected to two semi inﬁnite 1D
metal electrodes.

2 Method

2.1 Construction of the Finite Difference Scheme to solve the Volterra IDE

To solve equation (1.4) generally, consider following Volterra IDE:

d
dt

y(t) = f (t)y(t)+Z t

0

k(t−τ)y(τ)dτ

(2.1)

In which y(t) and f (t) stand for functions of an arbitrary real parameter t and k(t−τ)
represents a convolution between τ and t. In order to perform numerical calculations it is
really lucrative to make a discretization scheme for this IDE which allow us to use FDM.
The grid used for discretization is a set of points {1,2,··· ,nt} where nt is an integer and
shows the number of mesh points in the t domain which may be determined properly
based on the ﬂuctuations of the functions. Commonly, yt, ft and kt are nt dimensional
vectors which contain all information of functions y(t), f (t) and k(t), respectively. Beside
we need two operators; a ﬁrst order derivative operator and an integrator one; which are
represented by Dns
nt×nt, respectively. ns returns to ns-point stencil of a point in
the grid in FDM formalism; the point itself together with its ns−1 neighbours. Clearly
ns must usually choose in such a way that be less than or equal to nt, (ns ≤ nt). Here we
try to introduce these two operators properly.
The ﬁrst derivative of a function y(t) respect to the parameter t at a point ti is usually

nt×nt and Ins

approximated using a ns-point stencil as [17]:

y′(ti) ≈ di,iy(ti)+∑is∈neighborsdi,is y(tis )

(2.2)

The coefﬁcients di,j of this equation, while i and j can be integer numbers in this
set {1,2,··· ,nt}, are well known as Lagrange interpolation coefﬁcients [18] and are used
widely in FDM. These coefﬁcients should be exploited to derive Dns
nt×nt as a matrix whose
elements are zero except those that are di,j. Up to this precision, it is straightforward to
deﬁne the inverse of this derivative operator as an adequate integrator operator, namely
Ins
nt×nt. Uniqueness of this integrator operator imposes a boundary condition. Keeping
in mind the proper initial value condition, which is R 0
0 y(t)dt = 0, we pursue common
procedure in the FDM. For each boundary condition a row and a column are added to

4

integrator matrix [15] so that the ﬁnal integrator operator with boundary conditions is
introduced as:

Ins

(nt+1)×(nt+1) =(cid:18) Dns

In which, the elements of the matrix Bnt×1 are deﬁned as:

Bt,1 = δt,1

nt×nt Bnt×1
B†
nt×1

0 (cid:19)−1

(2.3)

(2.4)

In which δt,1 represents the Kronecker delta function. After inversion, we omit added row
and column of integrator operator with boundary conditions, Ins
(nt+1)×(nt+1), and reshape
it to new one, namely Ins
nt×nt which is integrator operator without boundary conditions. In
addition to bringing forward these two operators, we need to shed light on the right hand
side of the equation (2.1) and its meaning in our method. For the ﬁrst part we propose a
new operator which multiplies y(t) by f (t) and represent it with Mnt×nt. Clearly it must
multiply the same elements of yt by ft. It is satisﬁed by Exploiting the Kronecker delta
function as follows:

Mt,t′ = ft′ δt,t′

(2.5)

In the second part, we must integrate a function which is multiplication of the convolu-
tion function k(t−τ) by y(τ). Hiring the predeﬁned integrator operator and representing
a new integrator operator with convolution factor by Jns
nt×nt, we sufﬁciently introduce a
matrix whose elements are deﬁned as follow:

Jns
t,t′ = kt−t′+1 Ins
t,t′

(2.6)

In which t and t′ go from 1 to ns. We can rewrite equation (2.1) in matrix form using the
operators Dns

nt×nt, Mnt×nt and Jns

nt×nt:

(Dns− M− Jns ).y = 0

(2.7)

Where in it subscripts are omitted for abbreviation and matrices are multiplied in usual
matrix product law.

2.2 Construction of the Matrix Finite Difference Scheme to solve MIDE

To extend our method over matrix domain, retaining their deﬁnitions, we replace the
functions y, f and k with Yn×n, Fn×n and Kn×n, respectively where n is the dimension of
these matrices. The IDE substitutes by its matrix counterpart MIDE as follows:

d
dt

Yn×n(t) = Fn×n(t)Yn×n(t)+Z t

0

Kn×n(t−τ)Yn×n(τ)dτ

(2.8)

All of the matrices are time dependent. Discretization of these matrices in t domain even-
tuates 3D array version of them, namely Yx,x′,t, Fx,x′,t and Kx,x′,t where x, x′ and t are

5

integer numbers. x and x′ belong to set {1,2,··· ,n} and t goes from 1 to nt as pointed
before. Supporting matrix representation, we reshape Yx,x′,t to Yξ,x′, in which ξ sweeps
both parameters x and t. Consequently it becomes a (nt.n)×(n) matrix. For consistency
ξ is deﬁned as:
(2.9)

ξ(t,x) = t+(x−1)nt

By means of our previous deﬁnitions, we construct a new ﬁrst order derivative and
(nt.n)×(nt.n) denotes the ﬁrst order derivative

an integrator operator in this scope. Let Dn,ns
operator whose elements are deﬁned as:

ξ(t,x),ξ′(t′,x′) = δx,x′ Dns
Dn,ns
t,t′

(2.10)

t,t′ is the related matrix entry of Dns

Where Dns
tion (2.2) and δx,x′ is the Kronecker delta function. Suppose In,ns
integrator operator. The elements of this operator are determined as:

nt×nt which was formerly deﬁned in equa-
(nt.n)×(nt.n) stands for the

In,ns
ξ(t,x),ξ(t′,x′) = Kx,x′,t−t′+1 Ins
t,t′

(2.11)

t,t′ represents the proper entry of Ins

In this equation Ins
nt×nt, once was deﬁned in equation
(2.3). Pursuing our procedure we need an adequate operator to multiply Fx,x′,t′ by Yξ,x′.
Let M(nt.n)×(nt.n) represents it. Exerting the Kronecker delta function its elements are
assigned as:
(2.12)

ξ(t,x),ξ(t′,x′) = Fx,x′,t′ δt,t′

M

We put equations (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12) in to the equation (2.8) to achieve its FDM

counterpart as:

(Dn,ns−M−In,ns )Y(nt.n)×(n) = 0(nt.n)×(n)

(2.13)
In which 0(nt.n)×(n) denotes a zero matrix. Generally Y(t) at t = 0 is Y(t = 0) = Y1, i.e.: the
Y1 is an arbitrary n×n matrix at t = 0 with adequate conditions based on our problem.
Finally, we obtained ﬁrst order linear partial integro-differential equation as a system of
linear equations. To digest we get A = Dn,ns−In,ns−M.

Where B imposes boundary condition at t = 0 by following deﬁnition:

Bξ(x,t),x′ = δx,x′δt,1

(2.14)

(2.15)

In which δx,x′ and δt,1 are the Kronecker delta function. It should be noted that X is the
discarded part of the answer after solving the equation (2.14). The remainder of this
paper is reserved for material to exploit the above method.

3 Numerical results

3.1 Studying the electronic transport of a one dimensional system

We start with a simple toy model. As a primarily system consider a simple MMM con-
sists of two-atom molecule connected to two semi inﬁnite 1D leads. As a primarily
system, consider an inﬁnite one dimensional chain of atoms which some part of it may
counts as center part and its two tails as two semi inﬁnite 1D electrodes(see ﬁgure 2). In

Figure 2: (Color online) Schematic illustration of a simple MMM consists of two-atom molecule connected to
two semi inﬁnite 1D leads.

the tight-binding approximation and second quantization representation, Hamiltonian
for the molecule can be written as follows:

H(t) = ∑
x

ǫ0c†

xcx +

′
∑

<x,x′>

tx,x′(t)c†

xcx′

(3.1)

where the summations run over the lattice sites, ǫ0 is the energy of the electrons at site x,
tx,x′ is the transfer energy between site x and x′, and c†
x (cx′ ) is the creation (annihilation)
operator of electrons at site x (x′). The prime on summation symbol omits the cases x=x′.
Σ(t) should be determined to solve equation (1.4). In this method, Σ(t) accounts for the
“interaction” of an open system; namely the center part; with the attached two ideal
semi inﬁnite leads. So the non-vanishing elements of the self-energy matrix (for this
considered system, the ﬁrst and the last elements) will be the conventional self-energy of
an ideal semi inﬁnite 1D chain which in the energy representation can be written as [19]:

Σ(ǫ) =


v2

v2

2 [V−ǫ−ip4−(ǫ−V)2]
2 [V−ǫ+ (ǫ−V)

|ǫ−V|p(ǫ−V)2−4]

|ǫ−V| < 2

|ǫ−V| > 2

(3.2)

In which V is the bias voltage, v is the coupling energy between leads and the central
molecule and ǫ is the energy. Σ(t) will be obtained by the Fourier transform of the Σ(ǫ):

Σ(t) =−iv2 Θ(t)

J1(2t)

t

eiVt

(3.3)

where Θ(t) is the Heaviside function, J1 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and other
parameters are similar to their Fourier transforms.

Rewriting the MIDE form of the equation (1.4) for this system, it will be found:

Σ(t−τ) (cid:19)G(τ)dτ = I δ(t)

(3.4)

Instead of the Green’s function, we continue our approach with time evolution operator
U(t) which has a simple relation with G(t): [G(t) = −iΘ(t)U(t)]. The boundary con-
dition for U(t) at t = 0 is U(0) = ˆ12×2. Finally, to use the FDM for equation (3.4), some
substitutions by replacing Y and Y1 in equation (2.14) with U and ˆ12×2, respectively and
turning K and F in equations (2.11) and (2.12) to self-energy and Hamiltonian matrices.
For numerical calculations, except for mentioned cases, parameters ns = 11 and nt = 1000
are ﬁxed to obtain time evolution operator (TEO) in the certain domain of t; (t = [0,··· ,50]
in this work)

Two major cases are distinguished, a MMM system in the limit of very weak electrods
coupling (isolated molecule), which means no convolution term in equation (3.4) [v = 0
in equations (3.2) and (3.3)] and a traditional MMM system [non-zero convolution term
in equation (3.4)]. The simplest model may consist of two atoms as the central molecule
in which the on-site energy of the electrons ignored and the hopping terms are constant
[ǫ0 = 0 and tx,x′(t) = 1.0 in the equation (3.1)]. For the isolated system, the exact analytical
solution of the equation (3.4) for U(t) can straightforwardly be found as:

U(t) = e−iHt =(cid:18) cos(t) −isin(t)

cos(t) (cid:19)

−isin(t)

(3.5)

In this case the FDM solutions for real and imaginary parts of U(t) are shown in ﬁgures 3
(a) and (b), respectively where in them Ui,j stands for the ith and jth entry of U(t) matrix.
Clearly FDM results for elements of U(t) matrix are in excellent agreement with ones
which obtained from analytical solutions.

The presence of a periodic time dependent perpendicular electric ﬁeld, makes a time
commutative time dependent Hamiltonian with dynamic on-site energies [ǫ0(t)=cos(t)].
Again, The exact analytical solution of the equation (3.4) for U(t) in this case may be
calculated as:

(3.6)

U(t) = e−iR t

0 H(τ)dτ = e−isin(t)(cid:18) cos(t) −isin(t)

cos(t) (cid:19)

−isin(t)

The FDM solutions for real and imaginary parts of U(t) are shown in ﬁgures 3 (c) and
(d). Once more, analytical results are consistent with FDM answers for elements of U(t)
matrix superbly.

In the case of time dependent, non-commutative Hamiltonian in time, a simple case
with vanishing on-site energies; ǫ0(t) = 0 and time dependent phase hopping tx,x′(t) =

e−iΦ(t) are studied. This phase hopping may emerge from an external magnetic ﬁeld or
strain, etc [20]. Regardless of the physical source of this phase, to facilitate the calculation,
a simple time dependent function Φ(t) = Ωt with Ω = 1.0 is selected. Dyson series are
usual method to study this types of Hamiltonian [21] which in compact form, exploiting
time order operator Tτ to respect the time order, it can be noted as [22]:

U(t) = Tτ(e−iR t

0 H(τ)dτ)

(3.7)

Although this equation is not as tractable as its former counterparts, it can be solved
analytically for this speciﬁc Hamiltonian and so its answer will be found as:

Figure 4: Real (a and c), and imaginary (b and d), parts of TEO elements for an isolated (a and b) and
an interacting (c and d) systems, in the case of time dependent non-commutative Hamiltonian in time, as
mentioned in equations (3.7) and (3.4), respectively.

In all three types of systems the elements of the TEO are not only periodic in time but
also non-dissipative which the later one is a natural property of an isolated system. This
may be counted as a good evidence for authenticity of the procedure.

For an “interacting” system which is more interesting, equation (1.4) contains the
convolution term. A simple model may be constructed with vanishing on-site energies;
ǫ0(t)=0 and time dependent hopping tx,x′(t) = e−iΦ(t) with Φ(t)= Ωt for central molecule
and a weak coupling probability between molecule and electrodes; v = 0.2 (as described
in third former isolated system). Unfortunately analytical solution for this system is in-
tractable but its numerical solution using FDM led to calculate real and imaginary parts
of U(t) (ﬁgures 4 (c) and (d), respectively).

Dissipative behaviour of elements of the TEO may be regarded as a good physical

proof for “interacting” nature of the system.

To illustrate both advantages and deﬁciencies of the FDM, comparison of it with
Dyson series method and RK family methods is appropriate. Figure 5 (a) shows the error
estimates for four distinct conditions for a short period of time after its initial condition
t0 = 0. In an isolated system “without any interactions with electrode”; i.e. [v = 0 in equa-
tions (3.2) and (3.3)]; the IDE equation (1.4) is modiﬁed to a trivial partial differential
equation(PDE) so RK family methods may be the best choice to solve it since RK family
methods are faster and more accurate than other ones [dashed line in ﬁgure 5 (a)]. Turn-
ing the “interactions” on, a general Volterra IDE [equation (1.4)] must be solved. Because

10

the RK method is a very rough approximation to calculate an integral, this method devi-
ates rapidly [dashed dot line in ﬁgure 5 (a)]. Power series characteristic of Dyson series
method in time causes it to ﬂuctuate in time faster than FDM. Comparison of dot line
which stands for Dyson series method with solid line which represents the FDM dia-
grams in ﬁgure 5 (a) can clarify it. Therefore in the vicinity of initial condition in time,
both Dyson series method and FDM are applicable but the former one is more accu-
rate. After a long enough period of time, effect of the higher power of time in Dyson
series causes larger ﬂuctuations and more deviations in its solution and only FDM can
be tractable and accurate. All of them are illustrated in ﬁgure 5 (b).

3.2 FDM application to study electronic transport in a trans-polyacetylene

molecule

Investigating charge transport in molecular junctions has been interesting for scientists
[1, 23–26]. Electrical transport properties of a system have a closed relation to the time
evolution of the charge density in it. Consider a MMM system composed of a trans-
polyacetylene molecule which contains 20 atoms as the central molecule and two 1D
ideal semi inﬁnite electrodes (ﬁgure 6), beside the assumption that the coupling energy
between the polyacetylene molecule and each electrode is v = 0.5 and an electric po-
tential difference is applied between leads ∆V = 2volt; the self-energy of each electrode
can be calculated by equation (3.3) in the time representation. Hamiltonian of the trans-
polyacetylene was written in the tight binding approximation and second quantization
representation [27, 28] as below:

′
∑

ǫ0c†

xcx +

H = ∑
x

tx,x′ c†
tx,x′ = t0−2α(−1)min(x,x′) u0

<x,x′>

xcx′

(3.9)

In which the summations run over the lattice sites and the on-site energy of electrons
(ǫ0) is set properly. The hopping terms tx,x′ relate to nearest neighbour sites. There are
three empirical parameters which clarify the magnitude of the hopping integrals. The

carbon-carbon atoms hopping integral related to π orbitals equals to t0 = 2.5eV. The
electron-phonon coupling constant is α=4.1eV ˚A−1 and u0=0.04 ˚A represents the constant
displacement due to Peierls distortion because of dimerization [20, 28]. Applying this
Hamiltonian and using the FDM, the equation (1.4) can be solved numerically. Suppose

11

|ψi,t = 0 > represents a state that an electron exists on ith atom (in the local atomic state i)
at the time t = 0. The TEO traces this state in the next time t as follow:

|ψi,t >= U(t)|ψi,t = 0 >

(3.10)

then the probability density of transition from ith atom at time t = 0 to jth atom at time t
is straightforward as:

Pi,j =| < ψj,t|ψi,t = 0 >|2

(3.11)

Evolution of this probability density in time may interpret as the movement of an electron
wave packet between different atomic states in the system. For instance ﬁgure 7 shows
the evolution of transition probability density from the ﬁrst atomic state, i=1 at time t=0
to all other states at any time (equation (3.11)).

Figure 7: (Color online) Transition probability from the ﬁrst atomic state at time t =0 to other states at time t.

To study charge transport in the system one needs to deﬁne the charge density in it.
Assume qi(t) denotes the charge density of the atomic state i at time t, which is related to
initial charges on all states, qj(0) as:

qi(t) = ∑
j

qj(0)| < ψi,t|ψj,t = 0 >|2

(3.12)

12

while its discrete counterpart can be rewritten in the matrix representation as:

qψ(t) = Pψ(t)qψ(0)

(3.13)

In which Pψ represents the matrix of the transition probabilities between atomic states
and qψ is a vector containing the charge of each one. Applying the TEO on the charge
density one may ﬁnd the propagation of it in the system during a speciﬁc time. For
instance assume, at the initial time (t = 0) one electron is arrived in ﬁrst atom of the
molecule from left lead (qi(0) = δi,1). The snapshots of the qψ(t) at different times are
shown in ﬁgure 8. At the time t = 5.5(AtomicUnit) this electron wave packet collides to
the right lead and diffracts [see the ﬁgure 8(d)] . Some parts of it reﬂected back and others
transferred to the right lead and this process persists in time. The time evolution of the
Hamiltonian eigenstates is useful. Assume |ǫ > denotes the eigenstate with eigenvalue ǫ.
This means that initially the equation (3.14) holds for this state so |ǫ,t = 0 > is calculated
by:
(3.14)

H(0)|ǫ,t = 0 >= ǫ|ǫ,t = 0 >

then its time evolution can be calculated by:

|ǫ,t >= U(t)|ǫ,t = 0 >

(3.15)

Suppose qǫ(t) denotes the charge density in energy level ǫ at time t. Rewriting equa-
tions (3.12) and (3.13) in these new basis, one may found:

qǫ(t) = ∑
ǫ′

qǫ′ (0)| < ǫ,t|ψǫ′ ,t = 0 >|2

and its discrete representation as:

qǫ(t) = Pǫ(t)qǫ(0)

(3.16)

(3.17)

In which Pǫ is a matrix which represents transition probabilities between energy eigen-
states and qǫ denotes a vector contains the charge of these energy levels. Consider half
ﬁlling situation with sorted states as initial state at the time t=0 and deﬁne the Fermi en-
ergy at the middle of the energy difference between highest full state and lowest empty
one, EF = 0.5eV. The snapshots of the time evolution of this initial state were shown in
Figure 9 in several times. During this process, states whose their energy are near the
Fermi energy, lose their charge while others are robust. These lost charges are transferred
to the leads and make a charge current.

To calculate the current, deﬁnition of the total charge in the center part of the system
at any time t is mandatory. This can be properly deﬁned by the summation of total charge
in all atoms of central molecule at any time t, as:

qT(t) = ∑
i

qi(t)

Figure 8: The evolution of a charge density from left to right snapshots in the atomic state basis.

Evolution of this total charge in time illustrates the meaning of the charge current
in the molecule. Three different cases were shown in ﬁgure 10. If the molecule become
separated from the leads, its total charge must be constant which is compatible with
the black dashed line diagram in ﬁgure 10. The red (blue) line diagram refers to the
situation in which the electron is arrived in ﬁrst (last) atom from left (right) lead at time
t = 0. Generally, amount of the charge reduces during the time evolution. At ﬁrst this
charge reduces rapidly and leaks to the leads but then partially increases due to contact
effect. The potential difference between the leads causes the total charge magnitude for
evolution from the left to the right of the molecule be grater than its reverse direction.
When the maximum of the charge density collides to the next lead, these two lines are
tangent to each others during the large reduction due to the charge leaking to the leads
[compare the violet dot line in ﬁgure 7 with ﬁgure 10 at time t = 5.5(AtomicUnit)] and
therefore intersect where direction of the charge ﬂow changes (points c1, c2 and c3). The
difference between the charge magnitude before and after charge leaking, determines net
amount of charge transferred to the leads which makes a charge current. Comparison
between this current interpretation and formal one which relates to the current density
operator is beneﬁcial {j(t) = ¯h
mℑ[ψ†(t)∇ψ(t)]}. The charge ﬂow is plotted in ﬁgure 11.
The extremums in this diagram are equal to collisions of the charge density with leads

which is satisﬁable. Applying this method for the ﬁrst and the last atoms of the molecule,
we calculated the current. All the charge evolutions in these two atoms emerge from
three distinct sources: 1. The initial charges which have remind there yet qL(R)(t), 2. The
charges which depend on other sites qL(R)→R(L)(t), 3. The interaction with the adjacent
lead qL(R)→Ll(r)(t). So we can ﬁnd the total transferred charge from the ﬁrst atom as:

qL(t) = P1,1(t)qL(0)

qL→R(t) =

n
∑
j=2

P1,j(t)qL(0)

qL→Ll (t) = qL(0)−qL(t)−qL→R(t)

and so for the last atom we have:

qR(t) = Pn,n(t)qR(0)

qR→L(t) =

n−1
∑
j=1

Pn,j(t)qR(0)

qR→Lr (t) = qR(0)−qR(t)−qR→L(t)

then the transferred charge from the molecule at any time t is calculated as:

q(t) =

1
2{[qL→R(t)+qR→Lr (t)]−[qR→L(t)+qL→Ll (t)]}

(3.21)

As our computations are in the independent electron approximation, total transferred charge
at every time t, is sum of all transferred charges in any inﬁnitesimal time period δτ. So
we have:

q(t)T = q(t)+q(t−δτ)+q(t−2δτ)+··· ≃Z t

0

q(t−τ)dτ

(3.22)

Therefore its time derivation will give the current [I(t) = d

dt q(t)T]. After a proper
time, for every constant voltage an steady current Is, will pass trough the system. Fig-
ure 12 shows the current diagram at constant voltage v = 5V where the steady current
is Is = 0.96mA. This tranquility time may interpret as a relaxation time, τ, which can be
calculated by ﬁtting the diagram of ﬁgure 12 to a proper function like f (t) = 1−e− t
τ . The
inverse of this relaxation time (τ−1) may be regarded as resistivity (ρ) of this system.

Following this procedure for other voltages, we can ﬁnd the voltage dependent di-
Indeed the relaxation time-voltage, the resistivity-

agrams of these three parameters.

4 Summery

In summery, we propose a new numerical method to study time evolution in physical
systems by using FDM. To solve the correspondent Volterraintegro−di f f erential equation,
ﬁrst we introduced a ﬁrst order derivative and an integrator operators and discretized
them. Using this method we studied the time evolution of a 1D chain Hamiltonian in
different situations and compared our results with Dyson series and Runge Kutta. Our
method not only is compatible with analytical results but also is more accurate than other
numerical methods. Furthermore we study the charge transport in a trans-polyacetylene
chain as a central molecule of a MMM system by considering time evolution of its charge
density and then calculated its current- voltage diagram.

The most signiﬁcant application emerges from this method that has not instantly men-
tioned is that it can properly be applied for time dependent Hamiltonians regardless of
the source of this time dependency. So it not only can be used for time dependent Hamil-
tonian but also may be used for time dependent self-energies related to the electrodes in
MMM system.
