Introduction

b → pK− and Λ0

The availability of large samples of high energy pp collision data has allowed signiﬁcant
improvements in the experimental studies of b baryons. The masses and lifetimes of the Λ0
b,
b and Ξ−
Ξ 0
b particles are all now known to within a few percent or better [1–5], and excited
Λ0
b and Ξb baryons have been discovered [6–8]. However, relatively few decay modes of
the b baryons have yet been studied. In particular, among the possible charmless hadronic
b → pπ− decays [9], the quasi-two-body
ﬁnal states, only the two-body Λ0
b → K 0
b → Λφ decay [10] and the three-body Λ0
S pπ− decay [11] have been observed,
Λ0
b → Λη decay [12]. No decay of a Ξb baryon
while evidence has been reported for the Λ0
to a charmless ﬁnal state has yet been observed. Such decays are of great interest as
they proceed either by tree-level decays involving the Cabibbo-Kobyashi-Maskawa [13, 14]
matrix element Vub or by loop-induced amplitudes, and they are consequently expected to
have suppressed decay rates in the Standard Model. Their study may also provide insights
into the mechanisms of hadronisation in b baryon decays. Moreover, charmless hadronic b
baryon decays provide interesting possibilities to search for CP violation eﬀects, as have
been seen in the corresponding B meson decays [15–19].

b and Ξ 0

In this paper, a search is reported for charmless decays of the Λ0

b baryons
to the ﬁnal states Λπ+π−, ΛK±π∓ and ΛK +K−. The inclusion of charge conjugate
processes is implied throughout, except where the determination of asymmetries is discussed.
Intermediate states containing charmed hadrons are excluded from the signal sample and
c → Λπ+ decay are used as a control sample
studied separately: transitions involving a Λ+
c → ΛK + decays
and to normalise the measured branching fractions, and those with Λ+
provide cross-checks of the analysis procedure. In all cases the Λ baryon is reconstructed in
the pπ− ﬁnal state. Although b baryon decays to the ΛK +π− and ΛK−π+ ﬁnal states can
be distinguished through correlation of the proton and kaon charges, they are combined
together in the ΛK±π∓ sample to improve the stability of the ﬁt to the mass spectra.
b → ΛK−π+ decays are expected to dominate over the modes
The Λ0
with swapped kaon and pion charges, and therefore the results are presented assuming the
suppressed contribution is negligible, as is commonly done in similar cases [16, 17, 20, 21].
No previous experimental information exists on the charmless hadronic decays being
b → Λπ+π− decay are
studied; theoretical predictions for the branching fraction of the Λ0
in the range 10−9–10−7 [22–24].

b → ΛK +π− and Ξ 0

The paper is organised as follows. A description of the LHCb detector and the dataset
used for the analysis is given in Sec. 2. The selection algorithms, the method to determine
signal yields, and the systematic uncertainties on the results are discussed in Secs. 3–5. The
measured branching fractions are presented in Sec. 6. Since signiﬁcant signals are observed
b → ΛK +K− channels, measurements of the phase-space
for the Λ0
integrated CP asymmetry parameters of these modes are reported in Sec. 7. Conclusions
are given in Sec. 8.

2 Detector and dataset

The analysis is based on pp collision data collected with the LHCb detector, corresponding
to 1.0 fb−1 at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011, and 2.0 fb−1 at a centre of mass
energy of 8 TeV in 2012. The LHCb detector [25, 26] is a single-arm forward spectrometer
covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < η < 5, designed for the study of particles containing
b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a
silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-
strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm,
and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of
the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged
particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at
200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter
(IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/pT) µm, where pT is the component of the
momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Diﬀerent types of charged hadrons are
distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons,
electrons and hadrons are identiﬁed by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-
pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.
Muons are identiﬁed by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire
proportional chambers.

The online event selection is performed by a trigger [27, 28], which consists of a
hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by
a software stage, in which all charged particles with pT > 500 (300) MeV/c are reconstructed
for 2011 (2012) data. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a
muon with high pT or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the
calorimeters. For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.5 GeV. The software
trigger requires a two-, three- or four-track secondary vertex with signiﬁcant displacement
from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one charged particle must have
transverse momentum pT > 1.7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from any PV.
A multivariate algorithm [29] is used for the identiﬁcation of secondary vertices consistent
with the decay of a b hadron.

The eﬃciency with which the software trigger selected the signal modes varied during
the data-taking period, for reasons that are related to the reconstruction of the long-lived
Λ baryon. Such decays are reconstructed in two diﬀerent categories, the ﬁrst involving Λ
particles that decay early enough for the produced particles to be reconstructed in the
vertex detector, and the second containing Λ baryons that decay later such that track
segments cannot be formed in the vertex detector. These categories are referred to as long
and downstream, respectively. During 2011, downstream tracks were not reconstructed in
the software trigger. Such tracks were included in the trigger logic during 2012 data-taking;
however, a signiﬁcant improvement in the algorithms was implemented during a technical
stop period. Consequently, the data are subdivided into three data-taking periods (2011,
2012a and 2012b) as well as the two reconstruction categories (long and downstream).
The 2012b sample has the best trigger eﬃciency, especially in the downstream category,

2

and is also the largest sample, corresponding to 1.4 fb−1. The long category has better
mass, momentum and vertex resolution than the downstream category.

Simulated data samples are used to study the response of the detector and to inves-
tigate certain categories of background. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated
using Pythia [30] with a speciﬁc LHCb conﬁguration [31]. Decays of hadronic par-
ticles are described by EvtGen [32], in which ﬁnal-state radiation is generated using
Photos [33]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response,
are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [34] as described in Ref. [35].

3 Selection requirements and eﬃciency modelling

The selection exploits the topology of the three-body decay and the b baryon kinematic
properties, ﬁrst in a preselection stage, with minimal eﬀect on signal eﬃciency, and
subsequently in a multivariate classiﬁer. Each b baryon candidate is reconstructed by
combining two oppositely charged tracks with a Λ candidate. The Λ decay products are
both required to have momentum greater than 2 GeV/c and to form a vertex with low
χ2
vtx. In addition, the tracks must not be associated with any PV as quantiﬁed by the χ2
IP
variable, deﬁned as the diﬀerence in χ2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without
the considered track. The track pair must satisfy |m(pπ−) − mΛ| < 20 (15) MeV/c2 for
downstream (long) candidates, where mΛ is the known Λ mass [36]. The Λ candidate is
associated to the PV which gives the smallest χ2
IP, and signiﬁcant vertex separation is
ensured with a requirement on χ2
VS, the square of the separation distance between the Λ
vertex and the associated PV divided by its uncertainty. A loose particle identiﬁcation
(PID) requirement, based primarily on information from the ring-imaging Cherenkov
detectors, is imposed on the proton candidate to remove background from K 0
S decays. For
downstream Λ candidates pΛ > 8 GeV/c is also required.
The scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the Λ candidate and the two h+h(cid:48)− tracks
is required to be greater than 3 GeV/c (4.2 GeV/c for downstream candidates). The IP
of the charged track with the largest pT is required to be greater than 0.05 mm. The
minimum, for any pair from (Λ, h+, h(cid:48)−), of the square of the distance of closest approach
divided by its uncertainty must be less than 5. The b baryon candidate must have a
good quality vertex, be signiﬁcantly displaced from the PV, and have pT > 1.5 GeV/c.
Furthermore, it must have low values of both χ2
IP and pointing angle (i.e. the angle between
the b baryon momentum vector and the line joining its production and decay vertices),
which ensure that it points back to the PV. Additionally, the Λ and b baryon candidate
vertices must be separated by at least 30 mm along the beam direction.

The candidates are separated with PID criteria (discussed below) into the three
diﬀerent ﬁnal states: Λπ+π−, ΛK±π∓ and ΛK +K−. Candidates where any of the tracks
is identiﬁed as a muon are rejected; this removes backgrounds resulting from semimuonic
b baryon decays, J/ψ → µ+µ− decays, or Λ0
b → Λµ+µ− decays [37]. Decays involving
intermediate Λ+
c baryons are removed from the signal sample with a veto that is applied
c →Λπ+ however, these

b → ΛD0 decay with D0 → h+h(cid:48)− are
around the Ξ +
also removed with a ±30 MeV/c2 window around the known D0 mass.
The b baryon candidates are required to have invariant mass within the range 5300 <
m(Λh+h(cid:48)−) < 6100 MeV/c2, when reconstructed with the appropriate mass hypothesis for
the h+ and h(cid:48)− tracks. To avoid potential biases during the selection optimisation, regions
of ±50 MeV/c2, to be compared to the typical resolution of 15 MeV/c2, around both the
b and Ξ 0
Λ0

b masses were not examined until the selection criteria were established.

Further separation of signal from combinatorial background candidates is achieved
with a boosted decision tree (BDT) multivariate classiﬁer [38, 39]. The BDT is trained
b → Λπ+π− signal sample and data from the sideband region 5838 <
using a simulated Λ0
m(Λπ+π−) < 6100 MeV/c2 for the background. To prevent bias, each sample is split into
two disjoint subsets and two separate classiﬁers are each trained and evaluated on diﬀerent
subsets, such that events used to train one BDT are classiﬁed using the other.

The set of input variables is chosen to optimise the performance of the algorithm, and
to minimise variation of the eﬃciency across the phase space. The input variables for the
BDTs are: pT, η, χ2
vtx of the b baryon candidate; the sum
of the χ2
vtx of the Λ candidate.
Separate BDT classiﬁers are trained for each data-taking period and for the downstream
and long categories.

The optimal BDT and PID cut values are determined separately for each subsample
by optimising the ﬁgure of merit sig/
[40], where a = 5 quantiﬁes the target
level of signiﬁcance in units of standard deviations (σ), sig is the eﬃciency of the signal
selection determined from simulated events, and B is the expected number of background
events in the signal region, which is estimated by extrapolating the result of a ﬁt to the
invariant mass distribution of the data sidebands. In the optimisation of the PID criteria,
possible cross-feed backgrounds from misidentiﬁed decays to the other signal ﬁnal states
are also considered; their relative rates are obtained from data using the control modes
containing Λ+
c decays. The optimised BDT requirements typically have signal eﬃciencies
of around 50 % whilst rejecting over 90 % of the combinatorial background. The optimised
PID requirements have eﬃciencies around 60 % and reject over 95 % (80 %) of π → K
(K → π) cross-feed. If more than one candidate is selected in any event, one is chosen at
random and all others discarded – this occurs in less than 2 % of selected events.
The eﬃciency of the selection requirements is studied using simulated events and, for
the PID requirements, high-yield data control samples of D0 → K−π+ and Λ → pπ−
decays [41]. A multibody decay can in general proceed through intermediate states as well
as through nonresonant amplitudes. It is therefore necessary to model the variation of
the eﬃciency, and to account for the distribution of signal events, over the phase space
of the decay. This is achieved, in a similar way as done for previous studies of b baryon
decays [11, 42, 43], by factorising the eﬃciency into a two-dimensional function of variables
that describe the Dalitz plot [44] and three one-dimensional functions for the angular
variables. Simulated events are binned in these variables in order to determine the selection

4

eﬃciencies. If no signiﬁcant b baryon signal is seen, the eﬃciency corresponding to a
uniform phase-space distribution is used, and a systematic uncertainty is assigned to
account for the variation across the phase space. For modes with a signiﬁcant yield, the
distribution in the phase space is obtained with the sPlot technique [45] with the b baryon
candidate invariant mass used as the control variable, and the eﬃciency corresponding to
the observed distribution is used.

4 Fit model and results

b → Λ+

c h− decays, are determined
All signal and background yields, as well as the yields of Λ0
using a single simultaneous unbinned extended maximum likelihood ﬁt to the b baryon
candidate invariant mass distributions for each ﬁnal state in the six subsamples, which
correspond to the three data-taking periods and two reconstruction categories. The
probability density function (PDF) in each invariant mass distribution is deﬁned as
the sum of components accounting for signals, cross-feed contributions, combinatorial
background and other backgrounds. Fitting the subsamples simultaneously allows the
use of common shape parameters, while ﬁtting the diﬀerent ﬁnal states simultaneously
facilitates the imposition of constraints on the level of cross-feed backgrounds.

Signal PDFs are known to have asymmetric tails that result from a combination of
the eﬀects of ﬁnal-state radiation and stochastic tracking imperfections. The signal mass
distributions are each modelled by the sum of two Crystal Ball (CB) functions [46] with
a common mean and tails on opposite sides, where the high-mass tail accounts for non-
Gaussian reconstruction eﬀects. The peak positions and overall widths of the CB functions
are free parameters of the ﬁt to data, while other shape parameters are determined from
simulated samples, separately for each subsample, and are ﬁxed in the ﬁt to data.

Cross-feed backgrounds are also modelled by the sum of two CB functions. The shape
parameters are determined from simulation, separately for each subsample, and calibrated
with the high-yield data control samples to account for the eﬀects of the PID criteria. In
the ﬁt to data, the misidentiﬁcation rates are constrained to be consistent with expectation.
An exponential function is used to describe the combinatorial background, the yield of
which is treated as independent for each subsample. The shape parameter is taken to be
the same for all data-taking periods, independently for each ﬁnal state and reconstruction
category. In addition, components are included to account for possible backgrounds from b
baryon decays giving the same ﬁnal state but with an extra soft (low energy) particle that
is not reconstructed; examples include the photon that arises from Σ0 → Λγ decay and
the neutral pion in the K∗+ → K +π0 decay. Such partially reconstructed backgrounds
are modelled by a generalised ARGUS function [47] convolved with a Gaussian function,
π− control mode where a nonparametric density
except in the case of the Λ0
estimate is used. The shape parameters are determined from simulation, separately for
the two reconstruction categories but for the data-taking periods combined, and are ﬁxed
in the ﬁt to data.

b → Λπ+π− channel is over 5 σ, the uncertainty on its Dalitz plot
signiﬁcance of the Λ0
distribution is too large for this method of determining the average eﬃciency to be viable.

5 Systematic uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties in the branching fraction measurements are minimised by the
choice of a normalisation channel with similar topology and ﬁnal-state particles. There are
residual uncertainties due to approximations made in the ﬁt model, imperfect knowledge
of the eﬃciency, and the uncertainty on the normalisation channel yield. The systematic
uncertainties are evaluated separately for each subsample, with correlations taken into
account in the combination of results. A summary of the uncertainties assigned on the
combined results is given in Table 2.

The systematic uncertainty from the ﬁt model is evaluated by using alternative shapes
for each of the components, for both the charmless and Λ+
c spectra. The double Crystal Ball
function used for the signal component is replaced with the sum of two Gaussian functions
with a common mean. The partially reconstructed background shapes are replaced with
nonparametric functions determined from simulation. The combinatorial background
model is changed from an exponential function to a second-order polynomial shape. In
addition, the eﬀect of varying ﬁxed parameters of the model within their uncertainties is
evaluated with pseudoexperiments and added in quadrature to the ﬁt model systematic
uncertainty.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty related to the evaluation of the

determined from the eﬀect of ﬂuctuating the eﬃciency, within uncertainties, in each
phase-space bin. The second is determined from the variation of the eﬃciency across the
phase space, and is relevant only for modes without a signiﬁcant signal yield. The third,
from the uncertainty on the kinematical agreement between the signal mode and the PID
control modes, is determined by varying the binning of these control samples. Finally, the
eﬀects of the vetoes applied to remove charmed intermediate states are investigated by
studying the variation in the result with diﬀerent requirements.

B(Λ+
b → ΛK +K− decays is not reliable, owing to the absence
of data in the signal region in the long reconstruction category, a Bayesian approach [51] is
used to obtain an upper limit on the branching fraction of this decay mode. The Ξ 0
b signal
region, 5763 < m(Λh+h−) < 5823 MeV/c2, is assumed to contain the Poisson distributed
sum of background and signal components. The prior probability distribution for the
signal rate is ﬂat, whereas the prior for the background rate is a Gaussian distribution
based on the expectation from the maximum likelihood ﬁt, found by extrapolating the
combinatorial background component from the ﬁt into the signal region. Both of these
prior distributions are truncated to remove the unphysical (negative) region. Log-normal
priors are used for the normalisation mode yield, the signal and normalisation channel
eﬃciencies, and all other sources of systematic uncertainty. The posterior probability
distribution is obtained by integrating over the nuisance parameters using Markov chain
Monte Carlo [52]. For consistency, the same method is used to obtain upper limits on the
branching fractions of all modes which do not have signiﬁcant yields.

which can be slightly diﬀerent for reconstructed signal and control modes, is negligible.

are evaluated in a similar way as for the branching fraction measurements. The total
systematic uncertainty is obtained by summing all contributions in quadrature.

than 3 σ from zero, indicating consistency with CP symmetry.

8 Conclusions

Using a data sample collected by the LHCb experiment corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 3 fb−1 of high-energy pp collisions, a search for charmless three-body decays
of b baryons to the Λπ+π−, ΛK±π∓ and ΛK +K− ﬁnal states has been performed. The
b → ΛK +K− decay modes are observed for the ﬁrst time, and their
b → ΛK +π− and Λ0

branching fractions and CP asymmetry parameters are measured. No evidence is seen
for CP asymmetry in the phase-space integrated decay rates of these modes. Evidence
