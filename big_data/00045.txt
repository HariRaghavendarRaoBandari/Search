Integral dimension of a noetherian ring

1 Introduction

Throughout this paper we always use R to denote a commutative noetherian
ring with an identity. The main purpose of the paper is to introduce a new
notion, integral dimension, for noetherian rings.

Let J be an ideal of R. An element x ∈ J is said to be integral over J, if

there is an equation of the form

xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an = 0

where ai ∈ J i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
It is not diﬃcult to show that the set of all
elements which are integral over J is an ideal of R. We will use J to denote this
ideal, and call it the integral closure of the ideal J. An ideal I with I ⊆ J will
be said to be integral over J.

One of the main interests on J is when J n is contained in a power of J.
Let us recall several remarkable results established in the past years. Rees [Re]
showed that if R is an analytically unramiﬁed local ring and J an ideal of R,
then there is an integer k, depending on J, such that J n ⊆ J n−k for n ≥ k.

Let R be the ring of convergent power series in n variables Z1, · · · , Zn over
the ﬁeld of complex numbers C. Let f ∈ R be a non unit element and J =
(∂f /∂Z1, · · · , ∂f /∂Zn) be the Jacobian ideal of f . It can be proved [cf. HS]
that f is integral over J. Brian¸con and Skoda [BS] showed by analytic method
that f n ∈ J , and this is known as the Brian¸con-Skoda theorem.

Lipman and Sathaye [LS] extended the theorem of Brian¸con-Skoda to arbi-
trary regular rings by purely algebraic method. They proved if R ia a regular
ring of dimension d > 0, then for all ideals J of R, J n ⊆ J n−d+1 for n ≥ d − 1.
Later on, Huneke [ Hu, Theorem 4.13] proved a far reaching result for a
broad class of noetherian rings. For example, He obtained that, for any re-
duced excellent local ring R, there exists an integer k ≥ 0, such that for all
ideals J of R, J n ⊆ J n−k for n ≥ k. The result of Huneke is known as the
uniform Brian¸con-Skoda theorem. Recently, Andersson and Wulcan [AW] pre-
sented global eﬀective versions of the Brian¸con-Skoda-Huneke theorem by ana-
lytic method.

In this paper, instead of considering the integral closure of the power ideal
. We prove in

J n, we will study the power of the integral closure of an ideal J

with the power of J may be easier than that of J n.
Hence the comparison of J
Motivated by this, we introduce the following notion of integral dimension for
noetherian rings.

n

Deﬁnition 1.1 Let R be a noetherian ring. If there exists an integer k ≥ 0
such that for all ideals J of R and for n ≥ k

n

J

⊆ J n−k,

(1.1)

then we deﬁne the integral dimension of R, denoted by i(R), to be the least
integer k such that (1.1) holds for all J and all n ≥ k. If such k does not exist,
then we set i(R) = ∞.

It is obvious that i(R) = k < ∞ if and only if k is the least integer such that

for every pair of ideals J ⊆ I, where I is integral over J,

I n ⊆ J n−k

for n ≥ k. Moreover, we have Qk+1 = 0 for the nilradical Q of R because it is
integral over the zero ideal. Clearly, if R is an artinian ring, then i(R) ≤ l(R),
where l(R) denotes the length of R.

It follows easily from the Lipman-Sathaye theorem, i(R) ≤ d − 1 for every
regular ring of dimension d > 0. The above mentioned result of Huneke implies
that if R is a reduced excellent local ring, then i(R) < ∞.

In this paper, we will prove some basic facts about the behavior of i(R)
under several operations on R. The results show that i(R) behaves well under
operations such as localization and completion.

We will give a lower bound for i(R) in terms of the dimension d of R.
Explicitly, we will show i(R) ≥ d − 1. In particular, it follows from Lipman-
Sathaye theorem, if R is a regular ring of dimension d > 0, then i(R) = d − 1.
We can prove a noetherian ring R with i(R) = 0 if and only if R is a regular
ring of dimension d ≤ 1.

The main goal of the paper is to show that i(R) < ∞ for a large class of
noetherian rings. Recall that a S-algebra R is said to be essentially of ﬁnite
type over a ring S, if R is a localization of a ﬁnitely generated S-algebra. Our
main result of the paper states as follows:

Theorem 3.6 Let R be a noetherian ring of ﬁnite dimension. If R satisﬁes

one of the following conditions, then i(R) < ∞.

(i) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over a local ring S.
(ii) R is a ring of characteristic p, and R is module ﬁnite over Rp.
(iii) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over the ring of integer numbers Z.

In particular, one can conclude from Theorem 3.6, i(R) < ∞ for any noethe-
rian local ring R. It implies that the notion of the integral dimension becomes

2

a well-deﬁned notion and has concrete meaning in the class of local rings. We
do not know whether i(R) is ﬁnite for every noetherian ring R. It seems very
diﬃcult to give an answer to the question in general. However, we can prove
(see, Corollary 2.11) that dim(R) < ∞ if i(R) < ∞. We make the following
conjecture.

Conjecture 1.2 Let R be a noetherian ring of ﬁnite dimension. Then i(R) <
∞.

Huneke [Hu] observed that the uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property plays an
important role in the study of the uniform Artin-Rees property of a noetherian
ring. As pointed out in Theorem 3.2, the ﬁniteness property of integral dimen-
sion is also useful in proving a ring with such uniform Artin-Rees property. The
proof of our main result Theorem 3.6 depends heavily on the uniform Artin-Rees
theorem of Huneke [Hu]. The main technique of Huneke came from the paper
of Lipman and Sathaye [LS] in characteristic 0 and the theory of tight closure
of [HH1] [HH2] in characteristic p. It can not be applied directly to proving a
result more general than Theorem 3.6.

Even for the local case, it would be very interesting to reveal more about the
relationship between i(R) and i(R/aR) for an element a in R with dim(R/aR) =
dim(R) − 1. We guess that they may be related to each other by something
like the multiplicities, e(R) and e(R/(a)) , of the maximal ideals of R and
R/(a). The answer is not known even for i(R) and i(R[X]), where R[X] is the
polynomial ring of R in the variable X. Hence there are a lot of questions about
integral dimension remained for further studying.

2 Basic properties

In this section, we will recall some basic facts about the integral closure
of an ideal, and then presents some properties of the integral dimension i(R).
Some of the results are known, one can ﬁnd in [cf. HS], we will prove them for
convenience of readers.

Let Q be the nilradical of R and Rred be the ring of R modulo Q. Since
there is an integer n such that Qn = 0, it is easy to see that Q is contained in
J for every ideal J of R, and an element x is integral over J if and only if ¯x,
the image of x in Rred, is integral over JRred. Thus we have:

Proposition 2.1 Let J be an ideal of R. Then JRred = JRred.

Integral dependence behaves well under localization:

Proposition 2.2 Let J be an ideal of R. Then for any multiplicatively closed
subset T of R, T −1J = T −1J.

3

Proof. Clearly, T −1J ⊆ T −1J by the deﬁnition of integral dependence. Let
a ∈ T −1J. By the deﬁnition of integral dependence again, there is an equation
of the form

an + a1an−1 + · · · + an = 0

in the ring T −1R, where ai ∈ T −1J i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Choose an element b ∈ T
such that ba ∈ R and bai ∈ J i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Hence we have

(ba)n + a1b(ba)n−1 + · · · + bnan = 0

is an equation with coeﬃcients in R, and there is an element b′ ∈ T such that

b′((ba)n + a1b(ba)n−1 + · · · + bnan) = 0

in R. It shows that

(b′ba)n + a1b′b(b′ba)n−1 + · · · + (b′b)nan = 0

is the desired equation which implies b′ba is integral over J. So a ∈ T −1J, and
T −1J ⊆ T −1J. This proves the proposition.

Corollary 2.3 Let T be any multiplicatively closed subset of R. Then i(T −1R) ≤
i(R).

Proof. If i(R) = ∞, there is nothing to prove. Now, assume that i(R) = k
is ﬁnite. For any ideal K of T −1R, there exists an ideal J of R such that
K = T −1J. By Proposition 2.2, K = T −1J. Note that J
⊆ J n−k for n ≥ k.
Thus, for n ≥ k, we have

n

n

K

n
= (T −1J)

= T −1J

n

⊆ T −1J n−k = (T −1J)

n−k

= K n−k

and it follows that i(T −1R) ≤ k.

It is well-known the dimension of R can be computed as follows:

dim(R) = sup{ dim(Rm) | m a maximal ideal of R},

where Rm denotes the localization of R at the maximal ideal m. Similarly, we
have the following computation for integral dimension.

Corollary 2.4 For a noetherian ring R, i(R) = sup{ i(Rm) | m a maximal ideal of R}.

Proof. Let us set

t = sup{ i(Rm) | m a maximal ideal of R}.

By Corollary 2.3, we have i(R) ≥ t. On the other hand, if t = ∞, then

i(R) = ∞ and thus i(R) = t holds in this case.

Now, assume that t < ∞. For any ideal I of R, we have i(Rm) ≤ t and

(IRm)n ⊆ (IRm)n−t

4

for all for n ≥ t and for any maximal ideal m of R. By Proposition 2.2, IRm =
IRm. It implies

n

⊆ I n−t for n ≥ t, and consequently i(R) ≤ t.

I

for all maximal ideals m. Hence I
This proves the corollary.

Rm ⊆ I n−tRm

Now, we recall a useful tool, the reduction of an ideal, for studying the
integral closure of an ideal. An ideal J ⊆ I is said to be a reduction of the ideal
I, if there exists an integer k such that I k+l = JI k. One important result about
reduction is the following proposition.

Proposition 2.5 Let R be a noetherian ring and J ⊆ I a pair of ideals of R.
Then the following conditions are equivalent.

(i) J is a reduction of I.
(ii) I is integral over J.

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii) By assumption, there is an integer k such that I k+l = JI k. As
R is a noetherian ring, the ideal I k is ﬁnitely generated. Set I k = (a1, a2, · · · , an).
For a ∈ I and i(1 ≤ i ≤ n), write aai = Pn
j=1 aijaj for some aij ∈ J. Let
A = (aij) be the matrix (δij a − aij ), where δij is the Kronecker delta function.
By Cramer’s Rule, det(A)I k = 0. In particular, det(A)ak = 0, and an expansion
of det(A)ak = 0 yields the desired equation of integral dependence of a over J.
Hence I is integral over J.

(ii) ⇒ (i) Suppose that I is integral over J. Write I = (b1, b2, · · · , bs). For

each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ s, there is an equation of the form

i + ci1bni−1
bni

i

+ · · · + cini = 0

where cij ∈ I j for 1 ≤ j ≤ ni. Thus it implies bni
i ∈ JI ni−1. Put k =
Ps
j=1 nj + 1. It is clear that if r1 + r2 + · · · + rs = k, every element of the form
br1
1 br2
2 · · · brs

lies in JI k−1, and this proves that I k = JI k−1.

s

As an easy consequence of the proposition, we have the following result

mentioned in the last section.

Corollary 2.6 Let J be an ideal of R. Then for any integer n, J n ⊆ J

n

⊆ J n.

Proof. It follows from Proposition 2.5, J is a reduction of J. Thus there is an

Let ϕ : R → S be a morphism of noetherian rings. The property of per-
sistence of integral closure states that ϕ(J) ⊆ ϕ(J) for any ideal J of R. This
follows as by applying ϕ to an equation of integral dependence of an element
a over J to obtain an equation of integral dependence of ϕ(a) over the ideal
ϕ(J)S.

Proposition 2.7 Let ϕ : R → S be a faithfully ﬂat morphism of noetherian
rings. Then i(R) ≤ i(S).

Proof. If i(S) = ∞, there is nothing to prove. Now, we assume i(S) = k is ﬁnite.

If R is a local ring with the unique maximal ideal m, we use ˆR to denote
the m-adic completion of R. Since ˆR is faithfully ﬂat over R, i(R) ≤ i( ˆR) by
Proposition 2.7. We prove that this inequality is indeed an equality.

Proposition 2.8 Let (R, m) be a noetherian local ring. Then i(R) = i( ˆR).

Proof. It suﬃces to prove i( ˆR) ≤ i(R) by Proposition 2.7. If i(R) = ∞, there
is nothing to prove. In fact, such case cannot happen, we will prove in the next
section, i(R) is always a ﬁnite number. Now, put i(R) = k, and naturally regard
R as a sub-ring of ˆR. Let K = (b1, b2, · · · , br) be an arbitrary ideal of ˆR.

If K is a m ˆR-primary ideal, then there exists an integer t such that m

t ˆR ⊆ K.
By the deﬁnition of completion of a ring, we can choose elements ai ∈ R such
that bi − ai lies in mt+1 ˆR for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Let J be the ideal of R which is
generated by a1, a2, · · · , ar. Clearly, K ⊆ J ˆR + mK. So it follows that K = J ˆR
by Nakayama lemma. Since the integral closure K of K is also a m ˆR-primary
ideal, there is an ideal I of R, replacing I by I + J, we may assume J ⊆ I, such
that K = I ˆR. By Proposition 2.5, J ˆR is a reduction of I ˆR, and there is an
integer n0 such that I n0+1 ˆR = JI n0 ˆR. As ˆR is faithfully ﬂat over R, we obtain
I n0+1 = JI n0 . Hence for n ≥ k, I n ⊆ J n−k, and consequently

Now, we turn to giving a lower bound for i(R). We will show that if R
is of ﬁnite dimension d > 0, then i(R) is at least d − 1. Let us begin with
recalling Monomial Conjecture of Hochster which asserts that given any system
of parameters x1, x2, · · · , xd of a d-dimensional local ring R, then for all n > 1

(x1x2 · · · xd)n /∈ (xn+1

1

, xn+1

2

, · · · , xn+1

d

).

Hochster proved the conjecture in the equicharacteristic case [Ho1] [Ho2]. In
mixed cases, the conjecture remains undetermined, despite much eﬀort. How-
ever, Hochster [Ho1] pointed out, for any system of parameters x1, x2, · · · , xd
of R, there exists an integer t0, such that for all t ≥ t0, xt
d satisfying
Monomial Conjecture. In particular, we have:

2, · · · , xt

1, xt

6

Lemma 2.9 If R is a noetherian local ring of dimension d > 0, then there
exists a system of parameters x1, x2, · · · , xd of R such that for all n > 0

(x1x2 · · · xd)n /∈ (xn+1

1

, xn+1

2

, · · · , xn+1

d

).

By means of Lemma 2.9, we can prove the following interesting result.

Proposition 2.10 Let R be a noetherian ring dimension d > 0. Then i(R) ≥
d − 1.

Proof. Choose a maximal ideal m of R such that ht(m) = d. It is clear, dim(Rm) =
d. By Corollary 2.3, i(R) ≥ i(Rm). Replacing R by Rm, we may assume R is a
local ring with the maximal ideal m.

If d = 1, it follows from the deﬁnition of integral dimension that i(R) ≥ 0,

and thus the conclusion is true in this case.

Now we assume d ≥ 2. By Lemma 2.9, there is a system of parameters
x1, x2, · · · , xd of R such that the element (x1x2 · · · xd)n is not contained in the
ideal (xn+1

) for any n > 0.

Let us consider the two ideals I = (xd

and J = (xd

By Proposition 2.5, xd−1

is integral over J for i (1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1). It shows I is generated by elements
which are integral over J, and thus I is integral over J.

xd is integral over the ideal (xd

d), and thus xd−1

Suppose that i(R) < d − 1. We must have I d−1 ⊆ J by the deﬁnition of
integral dimension. In particular, it implies the multiplication of the following

(x1x2 · · · xd)d−1 ∈ (xd

d),

and this contradicts the choices of x1, x2, · · · , xd. Therefore i(R) ≥ d − 1, and
this proves the conclusion.

As an immediate consequence of Corollary 2.4 and Proposition 2.10, we have:

Corollary 2.11 Let R be a noetherian ring. If i(R) < ∞, then dim(R) < ∞.

Motivated by Proposition 2.10, we will say a noetherian local ring R of
dimension d is of minimal integral dimension if i(R) = d − 1. It follows from the
Lipman-Sathaye theorem [LS], i(R) ≤ d − 1 for every regular ring of dimension
d > 0. So by Proposition 2.10 , we have:

7

Corollary 2.12 Let R be a regular local ring of dimension d > 0. Then R is
of minimal integral dimension, i.e. i(R) = d − 1.

In the rest of the section, we consider the local ring R with i(R) = 0. Clearly
every ideal of R is integrally closed for such rings. By Proposition 2.10, we have
dimR ≤ 1. If R is an artinian local ring, then every ideal I of R with I 6= R is
integral over the zero ideal 0. So I = 0, and R must be a ﬁeld. For dimR = 1,
we have

Proposition 2.13 Let (R, m) be a noetherian local ring with i(R) = 0. If R is
not a ﬁeld, then R is a one dimensional regular local ring.

Proof. As we point out as above, under the assumption of R, R must be a local
ring of dimension 1. Since every ideal of R is integrally closed, it follows that
R is reduced because the nilradical of R is integral over the zero ideal.

Now, we show that R is a domain. It suﬃces to prove that R has only one
minimal prime ideal. Let P1, P2, · · · , Pr are all the minimal prime ideals of R.

If r ≥ 2, we can choose elements a, b such that

a ∈ P1, a /∈ ∩r

i=2Pi and b ∈ ∩r

i=2Pi, b /∈ P1.

It is obvious ab = 0, (a + b) /∈ P1 and a2 − (a + b)a = 0. It shows a is integral
over the ideal (a + b)R, and thus a ∈ (a + b)R because of (a + b)R = (a + b)R.

Write a = (a + b)c for some c ∈ R. If c /∈ m, then c is a unit of R. So

a + b = c−1a ∈ P1,

and this contradicts the choice of a+b. Hence c ∈ m, and it implies a(1−c) = bc.
Thus

a ∈ ∩r

i=2Pi

because 1 − c is a unit of R, which also contradicts the choice of a. Hence r = 1
and R is a domain.

Let Q(R) be the ﬁeld of the fractions of R. In order to prove that R is a
regular local ring, it suﬃces to show that R is integrally closed in Q(R) [Ma].
b be an element of Q(R) such that a
Let a
b is integral over R, where a, b ∈ R.
Hence there exists an equation of the form

(

a
b

)n + a1(

a
b

)n−1 + · · · + an = 0

where ai ∈ R for (1 ≤ i ≤ n). It yields that

an + a1ban−1 + · · · + bnan = 0.

It implies a is integral over the ideal bR. Since bR is integrally closed, it shows
a ∈ bR, and thus a
b ∈ R. Therefore R is a integrally closed domain, and the
proof of the proposition is complete.

The result of Proposition 2.13 means that a one dimensional noetherian local
ring with minimal integral dimension is a regular local ring. It would be very
interesting to study the properties of local rings with nonzero minimal integral
dimension. We conjecture:

Conjecture 2.14 Let (R, m) be a reduced local ring with minimal integral di-
mension i(R) > 0. Then R is a regular local ring.

3 Main result

In this section, we will present several suﬃcient conditions for a ring
R having ﬁnite integral dimension. Let us begin with recalling the notion of
uniform Artin-Rees property studied by Huneke [Hu].

Let R be a noetherian ring, we say that R has the uniform Artin-Rees
property, if for every pair N ⊆ M of ﬁnitely generated R-modules, there exists
a number k, depending on N, M , such that for all ideal I of R and all n ≥ k

I nM ∩ N ⊆ I n−kN.

First of all, we observe that if R has the uniform Artin-Rees property, then
we can reduce the question when i(R) is ﬁnite to the the reduced case when
i(Rred) < ∞.

Proposition 3.1 Let R be a noetherian ring. Then

(i) i(Rred) ≤ i(R).
(ii) If i(Rred) < ∞, then i(R) < ∞, provided that R has the uniform Artin-

Rees property.

Proof. (i) If i(R) = ∞, we must have i(Rred) ≤ ∞ by (i), and the conclusion
holds in this case.

Now we assume i(R) is a ﬁnite number and put i(R) = k. For any ideal
K of Rred, there is an ideal I with Q ⊆ I such that K = IRred. Note that
n
I

⊆ I n−k for n ≥ k. By Proposition 2.1, K = IRred. So

n

K

= I

n

Rred ⊆ I n−kRred = K n−k

for n ≥ k, this shows i(Rred) ≤ k, and the proof of (i) is complete.

(ii) Let Q be the nilradical of R. If Q = 0, then R = Rred, and there is
nothing to prove. Now, we assume Q 6= 0. Let n0 be the positive integer such
that Qn0 6= 0 and Qn0+1 = 0. Since R has the uniform Artin-Rees property, for
each i(1 ≤ i ≤ n0), there exists integer ki > 0 such that for all ideals I of R and
all n ≥ ki

I n ∩ Qi ⊆ I n−ki Qi.

(3.1)

Put k = i(Rred). By Proposition 2.1, for any ideal I of R, IRred = IRred.

It yields

n

I

Rred ⊆ I n−kRred

for n ≥ k. Equivalently, we have for n ≥ k

n

I

⊆ I n−k + Q.

(3.2)

Since I n−k ⊆ I

n−k

, it shows

n

I

⊆ I n−k + I

Hence if n ≥ k + k1, it follows from (3.1)

n

I

and then by (3.2), we have for n ≥ n − 2k − k1

n

I

In the following, we will use induction on i to prove

n

I

⊆ I n−ik−k1−···−ki−1 + Qi.

for i (2 ≤ i ≤ n0 + 1) and for all n ≥ ik + k1 + · · · + ki−1.

Clearly, the conclusion holds for i = 2 by (3.3). Suppose that

⊆ I n−jk−k1 −···−kj−1 + I

n−jk−k1 −···−kj−1 −kj Qj.

It follows from (3.2) that for n ≥ (j + 1)k + k1 + · · · + kj−1 + kj

n

I

⊆ I n−(j+1)k−k1 −···−kj + Qj+1.

Hence by induction, (3.4) holds for all i(2 ≤ i ≤ n0 + 1). Note that Qn0+1 = 0.
Thus we have shown

⊆ I n−(n0+1)k−k1−···−kn0 .

n

I

for n ≥ (n0 + 1)k + k1 + · · · + kn0 and for all ideals I of R. Therefore i(R) < ∞,
and this ends the proof of (ii).

To give a suﬃcient condition for a ring R having the uniform Artin-Rees

property, Huneke [Hu] studied two ideals T (R) and CM (R) of R.

For an integer k, set Tk(R) = T
I,n

(I n−k : I n), where the intersection is taken

over all n and all ideals I of R. We deﬁne T (R) = S
k

Tk(R). It is clear if k

10

increases, the ideals Tk also increase. Hence T (R) is an ideal of R. If T (R) = R,
we say that R has the uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property. Clearly, R has the
uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property if and only if there exists an integer k ≥ 0
such that for n ≥ k and all ideals I of R

I n ⊆ I n−k.

By Corollary 2.6, one can see easily i(R) < ∞ if R has the uniform Brian¸con-
Skoda property.

We need the following notion of standard complex of free modules to describe
the deﬁnition of the ideal CM (R). Recalling that a complex of ﬁnitely generated
free R-modules F .:

0 → Fn

fn→ Fn−1 → · · · → F1

f1→ F0

is said to satisfy the standard condition on rank if rank(fn) = rank(Fn), and
rank(fi+1) + rank(fi) = rank(Fi) for 1 ≤ i < n. Here we think fi as given
by a matrix Ai, and the rank of fi is the determinantal rank of Ai. Let I(fi)
be the ideal generated by the rank-size minors of Ai. We say that F . satisﬁes
the standard condition on height if ht(I(fi) ≥ i for all i. Note that the height
an ideal I is ∞ if I = R. We deﬁne CM (R) to be the ideal generated by all
elements a ∈ R such that for all complexes F . of ﬁnitely generated free R-
modules satisfying the standard conditions on height and rank, xHi(F .) = 0 for
all i ≥ 1.

As an easy consequence of Buchsbaum-Eisenbud criterion theorem for ex-
actness of a free complex [BE], it follows that CM (R) = R if and only if R is
a Cohen-Macaulay ring. One of the important questions concerning CM (R) is
when CM (R) is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of R. This question
is closely related to the existence of uniform local cohomological annihilators of
R which was introduced by the author [Zh1].

Recall that an element a ∈ R is said to be a uniform local cohomological

annihilator of R, if

(i) a is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of R,
(ii) For every maximal ideal m, a kills the i-th local cohomology module

Hi

m(R) for i < ht(m).

It is known [cf. Zh2] that CM (R) is not contained in any minimal prime ideal
of R if and only if R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator. Moreover,
Zhou proved a noetherian domain of ﬁnite dimension has a uniform local coho-
mological annihilator, provided R is a homomorphic image of a Cohen-Macaulay
ring [Zh1] or R is an excellent ring [Zh2].

By means of T (R/P ) and CM (R/P ) for every prime ideal P of R, Huneke
[Hu] proved an important criterion for rings having the uniform Artin-Rees
property. The same proof of Huneke works for the following criterion, which
replaces the condition T (R/P ) 6= 0 of [Hu, Theorem 3.4] by i(R/P ) < ∞.

Theorem 3.2 Let R be a noetherian ring with inﬁnite residue ﬁelds. Assume
that for all nonzero prime ideals P of R the following conditions hold:

11

(i) i(R/P ) < ∞.
(ii) CM (R/P ) 6= 0.

Then R has the uniform Artin-Rees property.

Combining Theorem 3.2 with the mentioned results of the author [Zh1] [Zh2]

, we have:

Corollary 3.3 Let R be a ﬁnite dimensional noetherian ring with i(R/P ) < ∞
for any prime ideal of R. If R satisﬁes one of the following conditions:

(i) R is an excellent ring.
(ii) R is a quotient ring of a Cohen-Macaulay ring of ﬁnite dimension.

Then R has the uniform Artin-Rees property.

The following remarkable result is proved by Huneke [Hu, Theorem 4.12],
which gives three suﬃcient conditions for rings having the uniform Artin-Rees
property. In particular, the theorem asserts that every local ring has the uniform
Artin-Rees property.

Theorem 3.4 Let R be a noetherian ring of ﬁnite dimension. R has the uni-
form Artin-Rees property if R satisﬁes one of the following conditions:

(i) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over a local ring.
(ii) R is a ring of characteristic p > 0, and R is module ﬁnite over Rp.
(iii) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over the ring of integer numbers Z.

The another remarkable result of Huneke [Hu] is the following uniform

Brian¸con-Skoda theorem [Hu, Theorem 4.13].

Theorem 3.5 Let R be a reduced noetherian ring of ﬁnite dimension. R has the
uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property if R satisﬁes one of the following conditions:

(i) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over an excellent local ring.
(ii) R is a ring of characteristic p > 0, and R is module ﬁnite over Rp.
(iii) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over the ring of integer numbers Z.

Now, we turn to the main result of the paper. By means of Proposition 3.1,
Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.5, we can prove the following main result, which
is a weaker generalization of Theorem 3.5.

Theorem 3.6 Let R be a noetherian ring of ﬁnite dimension. Then i(R) < ∞
if R satisﬁes one of the following conditions:

(i) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over a noetherian local ring.
(ii) R is a ring of characteristic p, and R is module ﬁnite over Rp.
(iii) R is essentially of ﬁnite type over the ring of integer numbers Z.

Proof. (i) By Corollary 2.3, we may assume R is of ﬁnite type over a local ring
(S, m). Let ˆS be the completion of S in the m-adic topology. It is known ˆS is
faithfully ﬂat over S, and thus B = R ⊗S ˆS is of ﬁnite type and faithfully ﬂat
over ˆS. From Proposition 2.7, it suﬃces to prove i(B) < ∞. Replacing R by
B, and S by ˆS, we may assume R is of ﬁnite type over an excellent ring S.

12

Write R = S[X1, X2, · · · , Xr]/I, where I is an ideal of the polynomial ring
S[X1, X2, · · · , Xr]. Let P1, P2, · · · , Pt be all the minimal prime ideals of I. Set
pi = Pi ∩ S for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. It is not diﬃcult to see that

Rred = S[X1, X2, · · · , Xr]/P1 ∩ P2 ∩ · · · ∩ Pt

is of ﬁnite type over the reduced excellent ring S/p1 ∩ p2 ∩ · · · ∩ pt. By Theorem
3.5, Rred has the uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property. In particular i(Rred) < ∞.
Now from Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.1, we conclude i(R) < ∞, and this
proves (i).

(ii) First, we show that Rred is module ﬁnite over (Rred)p.

In fact, let
P1, P2, · · · , Pr are all the minimal prime ideal of R. It is easy to see Rp/(Pi ∩Rp)
p is a prime ideal of Rp.
is naturally isomorphic to (R/Pi)p and Pi ∩ Rp = Pi
Hence the nilpotent ideal of Rp

I = P1 ∩ P2 ∩ · · · ∩ Pr ∩ Rp = P1

p ∩ P2

p ∩ · · · ∩ Pr

p

is an intersection of prime ideals of Rp. Conversely the nilradical ideal J is
clearly contained in I, so I is the nilradical ideal of Rp. It is easy to see P p
i
are all the distinct minimal prime ideals of Rp. Moreover, there is a natural
isomorphism between the rings Rp/I and (Rred)p. So if R is module ﬁnite over
Rp, then Rred is module ﬁnite over Rp/I, and thus is module ﬁnite over (Rred)p.
Now from Theorem 3.5, Rred has the uniform Brian¸con-Skoda property.
In particular i(Rred) < ∞. Now from Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.1, we
conclude i(R) < ∞, and this ends the proof of (ii).

(iii) Clearly, Rred is also essentially of ﬁnite type over the ring of integer
numbers Z. Hence from Theorem 3.5 i(Rred) < ∞. The conclusion follows from
Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.1, and this ends the proof of the theorem.

An immediate consequence of Theorem 3.5 is the following ﬁniteness prop-

erty of i(R) for any noetherian local ring R.

Corollary 3.7 Let R be a noetherian local ring. Then i(R) < ∞.
