Abstract: We investigate the implications of one light eV scale sterile neutrino on
the physics potential of the proposed long-baseline experiment DUNE. If the future short-
baseline experiments conﬁrm the existence of active-sterile oscillations, and the new mixing
angles (θ14, θ24, θ34) turn out to be comparable to θ13, then it can have signiﬁcant impact
on mass hierarchy (MH) and CP-violation (CPV) searches at DUNE. We ﬁnd that the
MH sensitivity still remains above 5σ if the three new mixing angles are all close to θ13.
In contrast, it can decrease to 4σ if the least constrained mixing angle θ34 is close to
its upper limit ∼ 300. We also assess the sensitivity to the CPV induced both by the
standard CP-phase δ13 ≡ δ, and the new CP-phases δ14 and δ34.
In the 3+1 scheme,
the discovery potential of CPV induced by δ13 gets substantially deteriorated compared
to the 3ν framework. In particular, the maximal sensitivity (reached around δ13 = ±900)
decreases from 5σ to 4σ if all the three new mixing angles are close to θ13. It can further
diminish to almost 3σ if θ34 is large (∼ 300). We ﬁnd that the sensitivity to the CPV
generated by the new phase δ14 can reach 3σ for an appreciable fraction of its true values.
Interestingly, θ34 and its associated phase δ34 can inﬂuence the appearance probability via
matter eﬀects which for DUNE are pronounced. Hence, δ34 can also contribute to CPV
provided θ34 is large. Finally, we investigate the capability of reconstructing the two phases
δ13 and δ14. The typical 1σ uncertainty on the reconstructed phase is ∼ 200 (∼ 300) for
δ13 (δ14) if θ34 = 0. The reconstruction of δ14 (but not that of δ13) appreciably degrades if
θ34 is large.

1 Introduction and Motivation

The high energy physics community is devoting enormous eﬀort at the cosmic, intensity,
and energy frontiers to unravel the deep long-standing mysteries of the Universe. At the
forefront of the intensity frontier, ambitious next-generation, long-baseline (LBL) neutrino
oscillation experiments are under consideration [1–5], whose mission will be that of deci-
phering the fundamental properties of these elusive particles, and of the interactions to
which they participate. The main objectives of the LBL experiments are to determine the
leptonic CP-violation (CPV), and to identify the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH). However,
the actual scope of these projects is much broader and to some extent unknown. As a
matter of fact, these setups are potentially able to unveil physics beyond the Standard
Model, which may be disguised in the form of new neutrino interactions or states.

The LBL experiments are high-precision neutrino interferometers, and as such, they
are the best place to study CPV, whose manifestation is intimately related to interference
phenomena. This is clearly the case of the standard 3-ﬂavor CPV, which is observable
through the interference of the oscillations driven by the two distinct (atmospheric and
solar) frequencies. Several non-standard neutrino properties are sources of additional CPV

– 1 –

and the LBL machines would naturally have a pivotal role also in these searches. Interest-
ingly, as ﬁrst evidenced in [6], the LBL experiments may be sensitive to the new CP-phases
arising in the presence of a light sterile neutrino state.

Sterile neutrinos represent one of the simplest and most “innocuous” extensions of the
Standard Model and naturally appear in many mechanisms of generation of the neutrino
masses.
Intriguingly, a series of anomalies recorded at the short baseline experiments,
lends support to the existence of such new neutrino states (see [7–9] for a review of the
topic). These phenomena cannot be accommodated in the 3-ﬂavor framework and require
the existence of a fourth mostly sterile mass eigenstate at the scale of ∼ 1 eV.

A rich and diverse program of new short-baseline (SBL) experiments is underway to test
such a hypothesis (see the review in [10]). The SBL experiments are surely the best place
where to look for light sterile neutrinos. In fact, at the short baselines the characteristic
new ∼ 1 eV2, should show
oscillating behavior driven by the new mass-squared splitting ∆m2
up. On the other hand, the SBL experiments cannot exhaust the exploration of sterile
neutrinos. In particular, they are not sensitive to the new CPV phenomena implied by the
sterile neutrinos, which need long distances to develop at a detectable level. Therefore,
in the eventuality of a discovery of a light sterile neutrino, the LBL setups would play a
complementary role to the SBL experiments, due to their unique sensitivity to the new
CP-phases.

An unavoidable (less desired) byproduct of this circumstance is that the performance
of the LBL machines towards their original targets tends to be deteriorated in the presence
of sterile neutrinos. This is evident for the CPV, since the new CP-phases tend to be
degenerate with the standard CP-phase δ. In addition, the well-known degeneracy between
MH and CPV, already existing in the 3-ﬂavor scheme, is exacerbated in the presence of
the new CP-phases. Consequently, also the MH discovery potential can be appreciably
reduced. Therefore, in view of the potential discovery of a light sterile neutrino at the SBL
experiments, a reassessment of the performance of the planned LBL projects appears to
be mandatory.

The 4-ﬂavor analyses1 [6, 13] of the latest data collected by the two currently running
LBL experiments T2K and NOνA2 have given already some weak hints on the new CP-
phases involved in the 3+1 scheme and have also evidenced the fragility of the present
(weak) indication in favor of the normal hierarchy, which emerges in the standard 3-ﬂavor
framework. In addition, in the recent prospective study [18] of T2K and NOνA, it has
been pointed out that even considering the full exposure regime for such two experiments,
their sensitivity to the standard CP-phase δ and their discovery potential of the neutrino
mass hierarchy are both substantially deteriorated in the presence of a sterile neutrino.
Therefore, the next natural step is to investigate the impact of a sterile neutrino at the
more sensitive next-generation LBL facilities. In the present work, we focus on the proposed

the global 3+1 ﬁts [11, 12].

1Such analyses are performed for realistic values of the new active-sterile mixing angles as indicated by
2In principle (see the 4-ﬂavor analysis performed in [14]), the new CP-phases can impact also the νµ → νe
searches of ICARUS [15, 16] and OPERA [17]. However, the very low statistics prevents to extract any
information on the CP-phases.

Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which is aiming to achieve new heights
in the intensity frontier by shooting a very powerful neutrino beam from Fermilab towards
the Homestake Mine in South Dakota over a distance of 1300 km3. Our work complements
other recent studies performed about DUNE [23–25]. Previous studies on sterile neutrinos
at LBL experiments can be found in [26–34].

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the theoretical frame-
work and present a detailed discussion of the behavior of the 4-ﬂavor νµ → νe transition
probabilities in vacuum and in matter. In section 3, we describe the details of the DUNE
setup and of the statistical analysis. In section 4, we make some important considerations
at the level of the bi-probability and bi-events plots and at the level of the energy spec-
trum, and then we present the results of the sensitivity study of the mass hierarchy in the
3+1 scheme. Section 5 is devoted to the results concerning the CPV discovery potential
and the capability of reconstruction of the CP-phases. Finally, we draw our conclusions in
section 6.

2 Transition probability in the 3+1 scheme

2.1 Theoretical framework

In the presence of a sterile neutrino νs, the mixing among the ﬂavor and the mass eigenstates
is described by a 4 × 4 matrix. A convenient parameterization of the mixing matrix is

(2.1)
where Rij ( ˜Rij) are real (complex) 4 × 4 rotations in the (i, j) plane containing the 2 × 2
submatrix

U = ˜R34R24 ˜R14R23 ˜R13R12 ,

sij ≡ sin θij

˜sij ≡ sije−iδij .

(2.3)

The parameterization in Eq. (2.1) has the following properties: i) When the mixing invoving
the fourth state is zero (θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 0) it returns the 3-ﬂavor matrix in its common
parameterization. ii) With the leftmost positioning of the matrix ˜R34 the vacuum νµ → νe
conversion probability is independent of θ34 and of the related CP-phase δ34 (see [6]).
iii) For small values of θ13 and of the mixing angles involving ν4, one has |Ue3|2 (cid:39) s2

14, |Uµ4|2 (cid:39) s2
|Ue4|2 = s2
34, with an immediate physical interpretation of
the new mixing angles.

3The CERN-Pyh¨asalmi baseline of 2290 km actively studied under the umbrella of the LBNO collab-
oration [19, 20] can also be very sensitive to these issues. The same is also true for the future T2HK
experiment [21, 22], which is a bigger version of T2K.

2.2 Transition probability in Vacuum

In the DUNE setup the matter eﬀects play an important role. However, for the sake of
clearness, before discussing the ﬂavor conversion in the presence of matter we give a brief
sketch of the basic formulae in vacuum. This will help the reader to grasp some new
qualitative features, which emerge solely in the presence to matter. As shown in [6], the
νµ → νe conversion probability can be written as the sum of three contributions

P 4ν

I + P INT

.

(2.4)

The ﬁrst (positive-deﬁnite) term is related to the atmospheric frequency and it gives the
leading contribution to the probability. The second and third terms are driven by the
interference of two distinct frequencies and can have both positive and negative sign. The
ﬁrst of the two interference terms is driven by the standard solar-atmospheric interference,
while the second one is related to the atmospheric-sterile interference. The transition
probability depends on the three small mixing angles θ13, θ14, θ24, whose best estimates,
derived from the global 3-ﬂavor analyses [35–37] (for θ13) and from the 3+1 ﬁts [11, 12] (for
θ14 and θ24), turn out to be very similar and we have approximately s13 ∼ s14 ∼ s24 ∼ 0.15
(see table 1). Therefore, it is meaningful to treat all such three mixing angles as small
quantities of the same order . An other small quantity entering the transition probability
is the ratio of the solar over the atmospheric mass-squared splitting α ≡ ∆m2
31 (cid:39)
±0.03, which can be assumed to be of order 2. Keeping terms up to the third order, in
vacuum, one ﬁnds [6]

where ∆ ≡ ∆m2
31L/4E is the atmospheric oscillating factor, which depends on the baseline
L and on the neutrino energy E. It is important to note that the vacuum expression of the
transition probability does not depend on the third mixing angle θ34 and on the associated
CP-phase δ34. As we will discuss in the next section, this is no more true in the presence
of matter, where such a dependency emerges.

2.3 Transition probability in Matter

In the presence of matter, the Hamiltonian in the ﬂavor basis can be written as

H = U KU† + V ,

where K denotes the diagonal matrix containing the wave numbers

K = diag(0, k21, k31, k41) ,

with ki1 = ∆m2

i1/2E (i = 2, 3, 4) and V is the matrix encoding the matter potential

V = diag(VCC, 0, 0, −VN C) ,

is useful to introduce the new basis

where

¯U = ˜R34R24 ˜R14

is the part of the mixing matrix deﬁned in Eq. (2.1) that contains only the rotations
involving the fourth neutrino mass eigenstate. In this new basis, the Hamiltonian takes
the form

¯H = ¯H kin + ¯H dyn = U3νKU

†
3ν + ¯U†V ¯U ,

where the ﬁrst term is the kinematic contribution describing the oscillations in vacuum,
and the second one represents a nonstandard dynamical term. As shown in [6] (see the
appendix), since |k41| is much bigger than one and much bigger than |k21| and |k31|, one can
reduce the dynamics to an eﬀective 3-ﬂavor system. Indeed, from Eq. (2.16) one has that
the (4,4) entry of ¯H is much bigger than all the other elements and the fourth eigenvalue of
¯H is much larger than the other three ones. As a result, the state ¯νs evolves independently
of the others. Extracting the submatrix with indices (1, 2, 3) from ¯H, one obtains the 3× 3
Hamiltonian

From Eq. (2.19) we see that for vanishing sterile neutrino angles (θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 0) one
recovers the (diagonal) standard 3-ﬂavor MSW Hamiltonian. In general, in the 4-ﬂavor
case, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.19) encodes both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal perturbations.
We can observe that these corrections are formally equivalent to non-standard neutrino

This formal analogy is helpful in understanding the sensitivity to the new dynamical eﬀects
implied by the sterile neutrinos. It is well known that in the νµ → νe channel, which is
relevant to the present discussion, the NSI that play the most important role are εeµ and
εeτ . If one assumes that the three new mixing angles have the same value s2
24 =
34 = 0.025, all the corrections in Eq. (2.20) are very small (|εαβ| (cid:39) 0.01) and they have a
s2
negligible impact. In this case, the dynamics is almost equivalent to that of the standard
3-ﬂavor case. However, if one allows the third mixing angle to assume values close to its
upper bound (θ34 ∼ 300), the elements of the third column of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.20)
can be appreciably larger (|εeτ| (cid:39) |εµτ| (cid:39) 0.04 and |ετ τ| (cid:39) 0.13). In this last case, one
may expect an appreciable dependency of the transition probability on the mixing angle
θ34 and on the associated CP-phase δ34. Therefore, in contrast to the vacuum case, in
matter, the transition probability is sensitive to these two additional parameters. This
behavior has been already pointed out in the analytical treatment presented in [6] (see
the appendix), and successively noticed in the numerical simulations performed in [25]. It
represents an interesting feature, because in favorable circumstances (i.e., a large value of
θ34), the νµ → νe channel may be sensitive not only to the two CP-phases δ13 and δ14
but also to the CP-phase δ34. Hence, the νµ → νe searches may provide full access to the
rich CPV structure of the 3+1 scheme. In order to illustrate the peculiar role of the third
mixing angle, in our numerical study we will consider the following three benchmark cases:
θ34 = 0, θ34 = 90 (i.e., equal to the other two mixing angles θ14 and θ24) and θ34 = 300
(which is a value close to its current upper bound). For clarity, we report these values in
the second column of Table 1.

For the sake of completeness we report the exact expression of the 4-ﬂavor transition

4We stress that this is only a formal analogy. The real NSI are mediated by heavy particles. In contrast,
in the case of sterile neutrinos there is no heavy mediator and the NSI-like structure of the Hamiltonian
is merely related to the fact that we are working in the new basis introduced in Eq. (2.14), which is
rotated with respect to the original ﬂavor basis and is particularly convenient to handle the problem under
consideration. It is worthwhile to mention that a similar analogy has been noticed concerning the solar
neutrino transitions in the presence of sterile species [38].

This expression is completely general, except for the assumption of averaged oscillations,
and connects the 4-ﬂavor transition probability to the amplitudes of the eﬀective 3-ﬂavor
ee ≡ | ¯See|2
system governed by the eﬀective Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.17). We have deﬁned ¯P 3ν
µe ≡ | ¯Seµ|2, where ¯See and ¯Seµ are the transition elements of the evolution operator
and ¯P 3ν
in the rotated basis (for a detailed derivation of Eq. (2.21) see [6]). Note that, in matter,
a dependency of the transition probability on the mixing angle θ34 and on its associated
CP-phase δ34 arises through ¯See and ¯Seµ. For a vanishing value of all the three mixing
angles θ14, θ24, θ34, Eq. (2.21) returns the 3-ﬂavor limit. For small values of the two mixing

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (2.22), apart from a pre-factor close to one, is the three-ﬂavor transi-
tion probability modiﬁed according to the non-standard dynamics encoded by Eq. (2.19).
This modiﬁed 3-ﬂavor probability, in vacuum, returns the standard transition probabil-
ity, which contains the well-known interference term between the atmospheric and solar
oscillations of Eq. (2.6). The second term in Eq. (2.22) has kinematical origin (i.e., it is
non-zero also in vacuum) and originates from the interference of the new large frequency
introduced by the fourth mass eigenstate with the atmospheric and solar splittings. As
shown in [6], only the interference with the atmospheric splitting is appreciable and, in
vacuum, the second term of Eq. (2.22) returns Eq. (2.7). The last term in Eq. (2.22) is of
the fourth order and has negligible impact.

3 Description of DUNE setup and Statistical Analysis

Hosted at Fermilab, DUNE is a next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation exper-
iment which will play an important role in the future neutrino roadmap to unravel the
fundamental properties of neutrino [39–43]. DUNE is a quite ambitious project, and to
accomplish its broad and rich physics objectives as a world-class facility, it is needed to
develop three major components: a) an intense (∼ megawatt), wide-band neutrino beam
at Fermilab, b) a ﬁne-grained, high-precision near neutrino detector just downstream of
the neutrino source, and c) a massive (∼ 40 kt) liquid argon time-projection chamber
(LArTPC) far detector housed deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility (SURF) 1300 km away in Lead, South Dakota. The LArTPC technology is quite
eﬀective for uniform and high accuracy imaging of massive active volumes [44]. One of the
merits of a LArTPC is that it works like a totally active calorimeter where one can detect
the energy deposited by all ﬁnal-state particles, providing an excellent energy resolution
over a wide range of energies inevitable to study the ﬁrst and second oscillation maxima.
We assume a ﬁducial mass of 35 kt for the far detector in our simulation, and consider the
detector properties which are given in Table 1 of Ref.
[19]. As far as the neutrino beam
speciﬁcations are concerned, we consider a proton beam power of 708 kW in its initial

– 7 –

phase with a proton energy of 120 GeV which can deliver 6× 1020 protons on target in 230
days per calendar year. In our simulation, we have used the ﬂuxes which were estimated
assuming a decay pipe length of 200 m and 200 kA horn current [45]. We consider a total
run time of ten years for this experiment which is equivalent to a total exposure of 248 kt
· MW · year. We assume that the DUNE experiment would use half of its full exposure in
the neutrino mode, and the remaining half would be used during antineutrino run. In our
simulation, we take the reconstructed neutrino and anti-neutrino energy range to be 0.5
GeV to 10 GeV. To incorporate the systematic uncertainties, we consider an uncorrelated
5% normalization error on signal, and 5% normalization error on background for both the
appearance and disappearance channels to analyze the prospective data from the DUNE
experiment. We consider the same set of systematics for both the neutrino and antineu-
trino channels which are also uncorrelated. For both νe and ¯νe appearance channels, the
backgrounds mainly arise from three diﬀerent sources: a) the intrinsic νe/¯νe contamination
of the beam, b) the number of muon events which will be misidentiﬁed as electron events,
and c) the neutral current events. Our assumptions on various components of the DUNE
set-up are slightly diﬀerent compared to what have been considered for the Conceptual
Design Report (CDR) reference design in Ref. [40]5. It has been shown in Ref. [40] that
considering the CDR reference beam design and with an exposure of 1320 kt · MW · year,
CPV can be determined for 75% of δ values at 3σ conﬁdence level. We have checked that
similar coverage in δ values for establishing CPV can be achieved with our assumptions
on the DUNE setup if we consider the same amount of exposure and the same oscillation
parameters.

The experimental sensitivities presented in this work are estimated using the GLoBES
software [46, 47] along with its new physics tools. We incorporate the 4-ﬂavor eﬀects both
in the νµ → νe appearance channel, and in the νµ → νµ disappearance channel. The same is
also true for the anti-neutrino mode. We take the neutrino interaction cross-sections from
Refs. [48, 49], where the authors gave the cross-section for water and isoscalar targets. To
obtain cross-sections for LAr, we have scaled the inclusive charged current cross-sections
of water by a factor of 1.06 for neutrino, and 0.94 for anti-neutrino [50, 51]. The details of
the statistical method that we follow in the present work, are exactly similar to what have
been described in section 4 of Ref. [18]. The only diﬀerence that we have in the present
paper is that, we have also analyzed the cases where the active-sterile mixing angle θ34
and its associated CP-phase δ34 are non-zero, since the impact of these parameters can
be signiﬁcant for the DUNE baseline as can be seen from our sensitivity results which we
present in the next sections. Table 1 shows the true values of the oscillation parameters and
their marginalization ranges which we consider in our simulation. For non-zero sin2 θ34, we
take the true values of 0.025 and 0.25 which are well within its allowed range [11, 12]. We
vary the true value of δ34 in its allowed range of [−π, π], and it has been marginalized over
its full range in the ﬁt as needed. We consider the mass-squared splitting ∆m2
41 = 1 eV2,

5But, needless to mention, these assumptions on the beam ﬂuxes, various detector characteristics, and
systematic uncertainties are preliminary, and are expected to evolve with time as our understanding about
the key components of the DUNE experiment is going to be reﬁned/improved with the help of ongoing
R&D eﬀorts.

which is the value currently suggested by the SBL anomalies. However, our results would
(cid:38) 0.1 eV2. For
be unchanged for diﬀerent choices of this parameter, provided that ∆m2
41
such values, the very fast oscillations driven by the new large mass-squared splittng are
completely averaged by the ﬁnite resolution of the detector. For the same reason, DUNE is
insensitive to the sgn(∆m2
41) and we can safely assume a deﬁnite (positive) sign for it. For
the 2-3 mixing angle, we consider the maximal mixing (π/4) as the true value, and in the
ﬁt, we marginalize over the range given in table 1. We marginalize over both the choices of
hierarchy in the ﬁt for all the analyses, except for the mass hierarchy discovery studies where
our goal is to exclude the wrong hierarchy in the ﬁt. We take the line-averaged constant
Earth matter density6 of 2.87 g/cm3 for the DUNE baseline. In our calculation, we do not
explicitly consider the near detector of DUNE which may provide some information on θ14
and θ24, but certainly, the near detector data are not sensitive to the CP-phases in which
we are interested. In our simulation, we have performed a full spectral analysis using the
binned events spectra for the DUNE setup. In the numerical analysis, the Poissonian ∆χ2
is marginalized over the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties using the method of pulls as
described in Refs. [53, 54]. To present the results, we display the 1, 2, 3σ conﬁdence levels

for 1 d.o.f. using the relation Nσ ≡(cid:112)∆χ2. In [55], it was demonstrated that the above

relation is valid in the frequentist method of hypothesis testing.

4 Mass hierarchy discovery potential in the 3+1 scheme

In this section we discuss the sensitivity of DUNE to the neutrino mass hierarchy. As a
ﬁrst step we provide a description at the level of the transition probability and at the level
of signal events aided by bi-probability and bi-event plots. Second, we highlight the role
of the spectral shape information in the hierarchy discrimination. Finally, we present the
results of the full numerical analysis.

4.1 Discussion at the level of bi-probability and bi-events plots

In the 3-ﬂavor framework, the behavior of the transition probability is often represented
with the CP-phase trajectory diagrams in bi-probability space, ﬁrst introduced in [56].
In the recent work [18], such representation has been extended to the 3+1 scheme. This
representation is particularly advantageous as it gives a bird-eye view of the salient features
of a given experimental setup, in particular its sensitivity to the MH. In Figure 1, we
show the bi-probability plots corresponding to the ﬁrst oscillation maximum (E = 3 GeV)
obtained for four values of δ14.
In each panel, we also show the 3-ﬂavor ellipses (black
curves) for the sake of comparison. In both the 3-ﬂavor and 4-ﬂavor ellipses, the running
parameter is the CP-phase δ13 varying in the range [−π, π]. The solid (dashed) curves refer
to NH (IH). In the 3-ﬂavor case the ellipses are basically degenerate with a line, because
at the ﬁrst oscillation maximum only terms proportional to sin δ13 survive in the transition
probability. In contrast, in the 4-ﬂavor case, there are both terms proportional to cos δ13
and sin δ13 (see [18] for details). The orientation and the lengths of the two axes of the

assumed.
In the most general case, when θ34 is non-zero, the geometrical properties of
the ellipses sensibly depends also on the third CP-phase δ34. Such a dependency is more
pronounced when θ34 is large.

From the four bi-probability plots shown in Fig. 1, one can already envisage that

the separation of the two mass hierarchies tends to decrease in the 3+1 scheme. In fact,
for particular values of the CP-phases, the minimal distance between the NH and IH
ellipses decreases with respect to the 3-ﬂavor case. The overall picture can be visualised by
introducing the convoluted bi-probability plots shown in Fig. 2. These plots are generated
by superimposing several ellipses corresponding to all the possible choices of δ14 and δ34. In
the left panel it is assumed θ34 = 0 and δ34 is irrelevant. The right panel is generated with
θ34 = 300 and also the phase δ34 is relevant. The graphs in Fig. 2 may be also seen as dense

right panel). Fig. 2 provides a bird-eye view of the degree of separation of the two neutrino
mass hierarchies in the 3+1 scheme. From the right panel, we can see that for θ34 = 300
there is even a small region of the bi-probability space where the two hierarchies overlap.
One may ask what happens when the integrated spectrum (and not the probability at the
ﬁrst oscillation maximum) is taken into account. Fig. 3, which represents the convolution
plots at the level of the total events, quantitatively answers this question. One can see
that the distance between the blobs corresponding to the two hierarchies tends to further
decrease. In particular, as evident from the right panel of Fig. 3, for θ34 = 300 there is
a sizable region where the two hierarchies overlap. For each point of this region there
are two possible choices of the three CP-phases (one choice corresponding to NH and the
other one to IH). In these cases there is a complete degeneracy between the two hierarchies
at the level of the total number of (both neutrino and antineutrino) events and the total
events information cannot distinguish among NH and IH. The star in the right panel of
Fig. 3, corresponding to 400 νe and 150 ¯νe events for both NH and IH, is a representative
degenerate case, which we intend to discuss in more detail in the following.

4.2 Role of the energy spectrum

The DUNE experiment employs a wide-band energy spectrum, whose shape brings ad-
ditional information to that given by the total number of events. Therefore, even when

there is a complete degeneracy at the level of the total number of events, it is possible to
distinguish the two hierarchies at some conﬁdence level. Figure 4 serves to illustrate this
point. It represents the expected signal event spectrum of DUNE for the νe (left panel) and
¯νe (right panel) appearance channels as a function of the reconstructed neutrino energy.
The red (blue) histogram corresponds to the case of NH (IH). All the spectra are obtained
for θ34 = 300. For the values of the three CP-phases (δ13, δ14, δ34) indicated in the legend,
which are diﬀerent for the two hierarchies, the number of neutrino and antineutrino events
are identical for the two hierarchies. This fact can be visualised in the right panel of the
convoluted bi-events plot shown in Fig. 3, where the two choices of parameters correspond
to the same point (indicated by a star). In this particular case, the distinction between the
two mass hierarchies relies solely upon the diﬀerence in the shape of the energy spectrum,
which, as one can appreciate in Fig. 4, is sizable. Therefore, we expect a good discrimi-
nation potential also for those points which are completely degenerate at the event level.
This will be conﬁrmed by the numerical simulation presented in the following, where we
ﬁnd that the pure-shape information is able to guarantee a minimal 4σ level separation
between the two mass hierarchies. This point makes it evident that a deep understanding
of the systematic uncertainties aﬀecting the shape of the spectrum should be considered
as an important intermediate target of DUNE and of the other new-generation wide-band
LBL experiments.

the three CP-phases (δ13, δ14, δ34) indicated in the legend, which are diﬀerent for NH and IH, the
number of neutrino and antineutrino events are identical for the two hierarchies. This behavior can
be visualized in the right panel of the convoluted bi-events plot shown in Fig. 3, where the two
choices of parameters correspond to the same point (indicated by a star). In this particular case,
the distinction between the two mass hierarchies relies solely upon the diﬀerence in the shape of
the energy spectrum.

4.3 Numerical Results

In our numerical analysis we calculate the DUNE discovery potential of the neutrino mass
hierarchy. This is deﬁned as the conﬁdence level at which one can exclude the false (or
wrong) test hierarchy given a data set generated with the true hierarchy. We have taken
the best ﬁt values of all the parameters as given in table 1. In the 3-ﬂavor scheme, we

have also marginalized over the CP-phase δ14 (and δ34 if θ34 (cid:54)= 0).
In Fig. 5 we show
the discovery potential of excluding the wrong hierarchy as a function of the true value
of δ13. In both panels we have ﬁxed θ14 = θ24 = 90. The left panel refers to θ34 = 0,
while the right panel corresponds to θ34 = 300.
In both cases, we consider NH as the
true hierarchy choice. In each panel, we give the results for the 3-ﬂavor case (thick black
curve) and for the 3+1 scheme (colored curves) for four diﬀerent values of the true δ14
(that is −900, 900, 00 and 1800). In the left panel (corresponding to θ34 = 0) we observe

there is a maximum around δ13 ∼ −900 and a minimum around δ13 ∼ 900. The opposite
is true for the IH (not shown). We can observe that in general there is a deterioration
of the discovery potential for all values of the new CP-phase δ14. However, even in the

(corresponding to θ34 = 300) the situation is qualitatively similar but the deterioration
is quantitatively larger. In particular, in the range δ13 ∈ [450, 1350], the sensitivity can
drop down to the 4σ level. This range corresponds to the region of the space spanned by
the thee CP-phases, where there is a basically a complete degeneracy at the level of the
total number of events (in both neutrino and antineutrino channels) and the distinction
between NH and IH is totally entrusted to the energy spectrum. A concrete example of
this kind has been provided in the previous subsection. To this regard it is important
to underline the fundamental diﬀerence between the experiments (like DUNE) that make
use of an on-axis broad-band neutrino beam and those using an oﬀ-axis conﬁguration
(T2K and NOνA). In this last case, there is basically no spectral information and, as a
consequence, there are regions of the parameters space where the MH discovery potential
is almost zero (see for example Fig. 14 in [18]). In a nutshell, in the oﬀ-axis conﬁguration
one has basically only the events counting at disposal, while in the on-axis case, there is
the extra information coming from the spectral shape. Needless to say, the precondition to
take advantage of this additional information is a good understanding of all the ingredients
that enter the calculation of the event spectrum and a reﬁned treatment of the related
systematic uncertainties.

5 CP-violation searches in the 3+1 scheme

In this section we explore the impact of sterile neutrinos in the CPV searches of DUNE.
In the 3+1 scheme there are three CP-phases, which all can contribute to CPV. We ﬁrst
discuss the discovery potential of the CPV induced by the standard 3-ﬂavor CP-phase
δ13 = δ. We will show that, in general, it tends to deteriorate in the 3+1 scheme with
respect to the 3-ﬂavor scheme. Then, we treat the sensitivity to the CPV induced by the
other two CP-phases δ14 and δ34. Finally, we assess the capability of reconstructing the
two phases δ13 and δ14.

5.1 CP-violation discovery potential

The discovery potential of CPV induced by δ13 is deﬁned as the conﬁdence level at which
one can reject the test hypothesis of no CP-violation from such a CP-phase, i.e. the cases
δ13 = 0 and δ13 = π. In Figure 6 we report the discovery potential as a function of the true
value of δ13. The left (right) panel refers to NH (IH). In both panels, the black dashed curve
corresponds to the 3-ﬂavor case. The red band is obtained in the 3+1 scheme. Both in
the 3-ﬂavor and 4-ﬂavor cases we marginalized over θ23 and over the hierarchy. In the 3+1
scheme we have taken the two mixing angles θ14 = θ24 = 90 while we have ﬁxed θ34 = 0.
In this case, among the two new phases δ14 and δ34, only the ﬁrst one is relevant. Since
its value is unknown we have marginalized δ14 over its allowed range. The variation of δ14
gives rise to the red band. Figure 6 shows that the discovery potential can be substantially
lower than that attained in the 3-ﬂavor framework. In particular for δ13 ∼ ±900, where

The bands displayed in the left, middle and right panels represent the discovery
potential of the CPV induced, respectively, by sin δ13, sin δ14 and sin δ34 in the 3+1 scheme. The
thinner (magenta) bands correspond to the case in which all the three new mixing angles have the
identical value θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 90. The thicker (green) bands correspond to the case in which
θ14 = θ24 = 90 and θ34 = 300. In each panel the two undisplayed CP-phases are assumed to be
unknown and have been marginalized away. The left panel also reports the 3-ﬂavor curve (black
dashed line) for the sake of comparison.

the discovery potential assumes the maximal value, it can decrease from the ∼ 5σ level
(3-ﬂavor case) to the ∼ 4σ level (3+1 case).

In the 3+1 scheme one expects CPV to come also from the two new phases δ14 and
δ34. In the second and third panels of Figure 7 we display the discovery potential of the
CPV induced by such two phases. In the ﬁrst panel, for the sake of comparison, we report
the discovery potential of the standard CP-phase δ13 so that one can have a global view
of the sensitivities. The thinner (magenta) bands correspond to the case in which all the
three new mixing angles have the identical value θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 90. The thicker (green)
bands correspond to the case in which θ14 = θ24 = 90 and θ34 = 300. In each panel the
two undisplayed CP-phases are assumed to be unknown and have been marginalized away.
From the comparison of the three panels we can see that if the three mixing angles have
all the same value θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 90 (see the magenta bands), there is a clear hierarchy
in the sensitivity to the three CP-phases. The standard phase δ13 comes ﬁrst, δ14 comes
next, and δ34 is the last one, inducing a negligible amount of CPV. In particular, we see
that, in the less optimistic cases, corresponding to the lower border of the bands, only
the standard CP-phase δ13 can give rise to a signal stronger than 3σ for an appreciable
fraction of the true values of the phase. This fraction appreciably decreases if θ34 increases
(compare the red band in the left panel of Figure 6 with the two bands in the left panel
of Figure 7). In Table 2, for completeness, we report such a fraction for the three values
of θ34 = 00, 90 and 300 as well as for the 3-ﬂavor case. In the same table we also report
as a benchmark the “guaranteed” discovery potential for the particular value δ13 = −900.

reports the value of θ34 (not relevant for the 3ν scheme). The third column reports the discovery
potential (in units of standard deviations) for the particular value δ13 = −900. The fourth column
reports the coverage at the 3σ level. Note that in the 3+1 scheme, the ﬁgures reported in the third
(fourth) columns represent the minimal “guaranteed” discovery potential (coverage) as derivable
from the lower border of the corresponding band in the left panel of Figs. 6 and 7.

Concerning the second CP-phase δ14 (see the middle panel), the discovery potential spans
over a wide band. In favorable cases one may observe a signal above the 3σ level. However,
the lower border of the band is always below the ∼ 2σ level. This implies that there is not a
guaranteed discovery potential at the 3σ level for such a phase. Finally, let us come to the
third CP-phase δ34, shown in the right panel. In this case, we see that if the mixing angle
θ34 is very big, the sensitivity substantially increases. This behavior can be understood by
observing that the mixing angle θ34 is basically the amplitude of any term proportional to
sin δ34 in the transition probability. We can also observe that the band is thinner for δ34 if
compared to the other two phases. This behavior can be traced in the diﬀerent origin of
the perturbations induced by the mixing angle θ34, which, as we have discussed in section
2, has a dynamical NSI-like origin.

5.2 Reconstruction of the CP-phases

In the previous subsection we have focused our attention on the discovery potential of the
CPV arising from the three CP-phases involved in the 3+1 scheme. However, we deem
it important to pursue the exploration of the CP-phases independently of the amount of
CPV (if any) that they may generate. In principle, any value of the CP-phases is plausible,
including the CP-conserving cases. According to this point of view, one should try to
answer the following question: what is the capability of reconstructing the true values
of the CP-phases. In the following we address this issue, conﬁning our study to the two
CP-phase δ13 and δ14, to which one expects to have a more pronounced sensitivity.

In Figure 8 we have performed this exercise under the assumption θ34 = 0, in which
case the third CP-phase δ34 is irrelevant. In each panel we show the regions reconstructed
around the representative true values of δ13 and δ14. In all cases we have taken the NH as the
true hierarchy in the data and then marginalized over NH and IH in theory. However, we
ﬁnd that the marginalization procedure never selects the wrong hierarchy. Hence, there is
no degeneracy between mass hierarchy and the CP-phases. Similar results (not shown) are
obtained for the IH case. The two upper panels refer to two representative CP-conserving
scenarios [0, 0] and [π, π]. The third and fourth panels refer to two representative CP-

violating cases [−π/2,−π/2] and [π/2, π/2]. The two conﬁdence levels correspond to 2σ
and 3σ (1 d.o.f.). We see that in all cases we obtain a unique reconstructed region at the 3σ
level7. The typical 1σ level uncertainty on the reconstructed CP-phases is approximately
200 (300) for δ13 (δ14). The regions in Fig. 8 should be compared with the analogous ones

7Note that this is true also in the second panel, because the four corners of the square form a connected

region due to the cyclic nature of the two CP-phases.

obtained with the combination of the prospective data of T2K and NOνA (see Fig. 13
in [18]). From such a comparison one can see that DUNE is much more eﬀective in the
reconstruction of the CP-phases. In fact, in the combination of T2K and NOνA, a good
reconstruction is possible only at the 1σ level and, in favorable cases, at the 2σ level. At
higher conﬁdence levels the reconstruction capability basically disappears. In DUNE the

This is imputable both to the higher statistics and to the
spectral shape information attainable from the wide-band neutrino ﬂux, which in T2K and
NOνA is essentially absent due to the oﬀ-axis conﬁguration of the beam.

We close our discussion on the CP-phases by showing the impact of θ34 and of the
ignorance of the related CP-phase δ34 on the reconstruction of the two CP-phases δ13 and
δ14. Figure 9 is analogous to Figure 8 but now it is assumed θ34 = 300. In this case the
transition probability depends also on the third CP-phase δ34. Since it is unknown, one has
to marginalize over this CP-phase when reconstructing the other two phases. As evident
from all panels of Fig. 9, the quality of the reconstruction deteriorates. In particular, the
uncertainty on δ14 substantially increases (roughly doubling from ∼ 300 to ∼ 600) while
that on δ13 remains basically unchanged (still around ∼ 250). Hence, the reconstruction
of the standard CP-phase δ13 is more robust than that of new CP-phase δ14 with respect
to the perturbations induced by a large value of the mixing angle θ34. This behavior can
be traced to the fact that, diﬀerently from δ13, the two new CP-phases δ14 and δ34 both
enter at the dynamical level [see Eqs. (2.19-2.20)], and in particular in the NSI-like matrix
element εeτ ∝ ˜s14˜s∗
34. Therefore, one may expect a certain degree of degeneracy among the
two new CP-phases, which in the marginalization process over the undisplayed CP-phase
δ34, translates into a deterioration in the reconstruction of δ14.

6 Conclusions and Outlook

We have investigated the impact of one light eV scale sterile neutrino on the prospective
data expected to be collected at the planned long-baseline experiment DUNE. We have
found that the discovery potential of the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH), remains well
above the 5σ level if all the three new mixing angles are relatively small (θ14 = θ24 =
θ34 = 90).
In contrast, if the third mixing angle θ34 is taken at its upper limit (θ34 =
300), the MH sensitivity can drop at the 4σ level. Our analysis has clearly shown that
the spectral information attainable from the wide-band spectrum employed by DUNE is
crucial to preserve a good sensitivity to the MH also in the 3+1 scheme. Therefore, a
full understanding of the systematic uncertainties involved in the spectral shape should be
considered as an essential intermediate goal for DUNE. We have also assessed the sensitivity
to the CPV induced both by the standard CP-phase δ13 ≡ δ and by the new CP-phases (δ14
and δ34 in our parameterization). We have found that the performance of DUNE in claiming
the discovery of CPV induced by δ13 is appreciably degraded with respect to the 3-ﬂavor
case. In particular, the maximal sensitivity (reached around δ13 = ±900) decreases from
the 5σ to the 4σ level if all the three new mixing angles are small (θ14 = θ24 = θ34 = 90)
and can drop almost to the 3σ level for θ34 = 300. The sensitivity to the CP-violation
induced by the new CP-phase δ14 can reach the 3σ level for an appreciable fraction of
its true values but never reaches the 4σ level. The sensitivity to the third CP-phase δ34,
which arises exclusively through matter eﬀects, is appreciable only if θ34 is large. We
ﬁnally investigated the capability of DUNE of reconstructing the true values of the two
CP-phases δ13 and δ14. The typical 1σ level uncertainty on the reconstructed CP-phases

– 21 –

is approximately 200 (300) for δ13 (δ14) in the case θ34 = 0. The reconstruction of δ14 (but
not that of δ13) appreciably degrades if θ34 is large.

The discovery of a sterile neutrino at the new short-baseline experiments may be around
the corner and, if realized, it may have formidable consequences for our understanding of
the microcosmos. After the discovery made at the SBL experiments, the LBL machines
will have the crucial role of exploring the rich structure of the enlarged CP-violation sector.
Arguably, it is not by mere chance that some of the most ambitious explorations of the
micro- and macrocosmos are entrusted to interference phenomena. The laser interferome-
ters of LIGO-VIRGO [57] have eventually given their fruits after several decades of eﬀort,
opening up a new window onto the Universe. Similarly, we hope that the new powerful
neutrino interferometers like DUNE may disclose a new door on the microcosmos.
