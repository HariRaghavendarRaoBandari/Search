We study Bell nonlocality in the one-sided device-independent framework native of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) steering. We derive a closed-form necessary and sufﬁcient criterion for systems composed of a qubit and
an untrusted black-box device to violate – under general dichotomic measurements on the qubit – a generic Bell
inequality from a very broad family of linear inequalities with arbitrarily many outputs for the untrusted device
and inputs for both parties. The optimal quantum measurements for maximal violation are also obtained. For 2
inputs and 2 outputs per user, our criterion becomes necessary and sufﬁcient for Bell nonlocality. Furthermore,
in that setting, its form generalizes recently obtained steering inequalities, which allows us to provide useful
feedback from nonlocality to the detection of steering. Finally, our results are directly generalizable to multipar-
tite scenarios. Our ﬁndings constitute a powerful tool for the study of the interplay between EPR steering and
Bell nonlocality, with applications expected in the near future.

Introduction.— Composite quantum systems can display
exotic forms of non-classical correlations, a phenomenon
known under the generic name of quantum nonlocality. For
bipartite systems, quantum nonlocal correlations can appear
in three variants. The ﬁrst one is entanglement, which refers
to inseparability of quantum states (described by density ma-
trices) [1]. The second one is Bell nonlocality [2], the im-
possibility of explaining measurement statistics (described
by joint probability distributions) with local hidden-variable
(LHV) models [3]. The third variant is called Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Steering [4], after the famous EPR
paper [5]. This is an effect by which ensembles of quan-
tum states are remotely prepared by local measurements at
a distant lab [4]. Formally, it is a property of mathematical
objects called assemblages, composed of single-partite prob-
ability distributions (describing the statistics at one lab) and
single-partite density matrices (describing quantum states at
the other lab). EPR steering thus constitutes an intermediate
notion between entanglement and Bell nonlocality [6].

Apart from their fundamental importance, nonlocal corre-
lations are of practical relevance: they are resources for cru-
cial physical tasks in quantum information. A remarkable
example is quantum key-distribution (QKD). Entanglement
is useful for QKD in the device-dependent (DD) scenario of
well-characterized, trusted quantum measurements [7]. Bell

nonlocality is a resource for device-independent (DI) QKD,
i.e., where both experimenters possess untrusted black-box
measurement apparatuses [8]. In turn, EPR steering has been
identiﬁed [9] as a resource [10] for one-sided (1S) DI QKD,
where only one of the parties – say, Alice – has an untrusted
black-box device while the other one – say, Bob – possesses
a trusted quantum platform. Fully (both-sided) DI protocols
relax the need for device characterization totally, but at the
expense of being very demanding experimentally [11]. 1S DI
QKD offers a middle-path alternative, relaxing device char-
acterization only on one side but having, in return, less strin-
gent experimental requirements [12] for unconditionally se-
cure keys [9] than in fully DI QKD.

These developments motivated a great amount of work on
the interplay between the different forms of quantum nonlo-
cality. The ﬁrst problem tackled was that of entangled versus
Bell nonlocal states (those capable of exhibiting Bell non-
locality). All pure entangled states were proven to be Bell
nonlocal [13–16], but mixed Bell local entangled states were
found [17]. Later, necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for ar-
bitrary 2-qubit states to be Bell nonlocal were derived [18].
A long list of improvements and generalizations of these pi-
oneering works then followed (see, for instance, Sec. III.A
of [2] and Refs. therein). The second problem was that of
entangled versus steerable states (those capable of exhibit-
ing EPR steering). Unsteerable entangled states, as well as
Bell local steerable ones, were found [6, 19]. This led to an
impressive amount of work. For instance, the sets of entan-
gled, steerable and Bell nonlocal states were proven inequiv-

alent under general measurements [20]; necessary criteria for
a two-qubit state to be steerable were found [21]; and con-
structive methods to test for unsteerability of a state were de-
veloped [22]. Finally, in addition to the many known steering
inequalities [12, 23–27], a necessary and sufﬁcient criterion
for EPR steering has been recently obtained for minimal-
dimension assemblages [28].

Here we consider a third problem: steerable versus Bell
nonlocal assemblages. We derive a closed-form necessary
and sufﬁcient criterion for a bipartite assemblage to vio-
late, under trusted general measurements [positive operator-
valued measures (POVM)] by Bob, a Bell inequality. The
optimal measurements for the maximal violation are also
given. Our theorems assume that Bob’s measurements are
dichotomic and that his system is a qubit, but are otherwise
general in the number of outcomes for Alice and settings for
both. Furthermore, we make only minimal assumptions on
the Bell inequalities treated, namely, that they are linear and
that their violations do not increase under probabilistic lo-
cal mixings of Bob’s outputs. Thus, many of the most pop-
ular Bell inequalities [29–32] are within the range of ap-
plicability of our criterion. We work in the usual scenario
of non-sequential measurements in the single-copy regime.
Hence, our criteria are to assemblages what the famous cri-
terion of [18] for violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-
Holt (CHSH) inequality [29] are to 2-qubit states, with the
difference that we handle more generic Bell inequalities. In
fact, for 2 inputs and 2 outputs per user, where CHSH vio-
lation and Bell nonlocality are equivalent [33], our criterion
unambiguously characterizes Bell nonlocal assemblages. In-
terestingly, in that setting, our criterion generalizes, in form,
recently obtained steering inequalities [25, 27]. By virtue of
this, we provide insight into the detection of EPR steering
within the framework of Bell nonlocality and explain formal
links between the two problems. Finally, our results are gen-
eralizable to the case of N-partite assemblages [34, 35] with
a single trusted part, so as to cover important multipartite in-
equalities [36–41]. Our ﬁndings constitute a powerful tool
for the study of EPR steering versus Bell nonlocality, with
potential implications in near-future research.

Preliminaries.— We consider two space-like separated
parties, Alice and Bob. Alice’s subsystem is a black box
with unknown internal functioning, which, given an input
x ∈ [i], outputs a ∈ [o], where i, o ∈ N and the notation
[n] := {0, . . . , n − 1}, for any n ∈ N, is introduced. Bob’s
subsystem is a qubit, on which he can perform any trusted
quantum measurement of his choice. The joint state of their
system is speciﬁed by a conditional probability P (a|x), of

(cid:88)

2

Alice getting the output a on input x, associated to a (normal-
ized) conditional quantum state a|x on Bob’s subsystem’s
Hilbert space H. These can be conveniently encapsulated in
an object called assemblage:

Ξ := {σa|x}a∈[o], x∈[i],

(1)
of (subnormalized) conditional quantum states σa|x on H,
with σa|x := P (a|x) a|x.

The assemblage Ξ is said to be unsteerable if it admits a

local-hidden state (LHS) decomposition [6]

σa|x =

P (λ) P (a|x, λ) (λ) ∀ a∈[o]
x∈[i] ,

(2)

λ

where λ is a local-hidden variable (LHV), occurring with
probability P (λ); P (a|x, λ) is a conditional probability of a
given x and λ; and the normalized state (λ) on H is called
an LHS. Any assemblage that does not admit an LHS model
as in Eq. (2) is called steerable.

On the other hand, in the DI scenario of both users pos-
sessing black-box devices, the joint system behavior is de-
scribed by a normalized conditional probability distribution

P := {P (a, b|x, y)}a,b∈[o], x,y∈[i],

(3)
where P (a, b|x, y) is the conditional probability of Alice and
Bob obtaining the output values a and b on input values x and
y, respectively.

In turn, P is Bell local, or, for short, local, if it admits an

LHV decomposition
P (a, b|x, y) =

(cid:88)

λ

P (λ) P (a|x, λ) P (b|y, λ),

(4)

for all a, b ∈ [o] and x, y ∈ [i], with P (b|y, λ) a conditional
probability of b given y and λ. Any joint distribution that
does not admit an LHV model as in Eq. (4) is called Bell
nonlocal, or nonlocal for short. We call L the set of all Bell
local distributions. For ease of notation, we have assumed
that the number of inputs (outputs) is the same, i (o), for
Alice and Bob, but all our results are also valid otherwise.

A sufﬁcient condition for a distribution to be Bell non-
local is the violation of a Bell inequality. Every linear
Bell inequality is represented by a pair {β, βL}, with β :=
{βa,b,x,y ∈ R}a,b∈[o], x,y∈[i] and βL ∈ R, such that

β · P :=

βa,b,x,y P (a, b|x, y) ≤ βL

(5)

(cid:88)

a,b∈[o], x,y∈[i]

any Hermitian operator O on H can be decomposed in a
2 [α 1 + r(O) · σ], where α :=
Bloch-sphere-like form O = 1
Tr[O] ∈ R, σ := (X, Y, Z) is the Pauli-operator vector, and

r(O) := (Tr[O X], Tr[O Y ], Tr[O Z]) ∈ R3.

(8)

If O is a state, r(O) represents its Bloch vector. Finally, for
any r = (x, y, z) ∈ R3, we denote its Euclidean norm by

(cid:107)r(cid:107) :=(cid:112)x2 + y2 + z2.

We can now present our main result, which we prove in

App. A:

Criterion 1 (Criterion for Bell violations). Let Ξ be a
generic assemblage given by Eq. (1) and let {β, βL} be a
well-behaved Bell inequality with dichotomic measurements
for Bob. Then, Ξ violates {β, βL} if, and only if,

(βa,0,x,y − βa,1,x,y) σa|x

for all P ∈ L. Our criterion below holds for all linear Bell in-
equalities whose violations do not increase under local prob-
abilistic mixings of Bob’s outputs, to which we refer, for
short, as well-behaved Bell inequalities. More precisely, lo-
cal mixings map P into a distribution P lm with elements

q(b|b(cid:48), y) P (a, b(cid:48)|x, y) ,

(6)

(cid:88)
where q(b|b(cid:48), y) ≥ 0, with(cid:80)

Plm(a, b|x, y) =

b(cid:48)∈[o]

b∈[o] q(b|b(cid:48), y) = 1, character-
izes the mixing probability for each input y and output b(cid:48).
Hence, {β, βL} is well behaved if β · P lm ≤ β · P for all
P for which β · P > βL. Local mixings can only map local
distributions into local distributions. So, that a Bell violation
does not increase under such mixings is a basic reasonable
property typically satisﬁed by known inequalities (includ-
ing all tight ones and, more generally, all those for which
a constant local weight [42] implies a constant violation).
Examples not satisfying this property can be found among
reducible inequalities that have superﬂuous terms [43].
Finally, we call an assemblage Ξ Bell nonlocal, or, for
short, nonlocal, if there exists a set M := {My}y∈[i] of mea-
b∈[o], with non-negative measure-
ment operators M (b)
y = 1 for
all y ∈ [i], being 1 the identity operator on H, such that the
resulting distribution P Ξ := {PΞ(a, b|x, y)}a,b∈[o], x,y∈[i],

is Bell nonlocal. Additionally, we say that Ξ violates a Bell
inequality {β, βL} if there exists M for which P Ξ violates
{β, βL}. Clearly, every unsteerable assemblage is Bell local
and only steerable assemblages can violate a Bell inequality.
Our deﬁnition of nonlocal assemblages considers only
non-sequential measurements on a single copy of the assem-
blage. For quantum states, it is known that sequential mea-
surements (ﬁlterings) [44, 45], or non-sequential measure-
ments on multiple copies of the state [46–48], can produce
nonlocal correlations from entangled states that would oth-
erwise yield local correlations. In fact, it has even been sug-
gested [49] that every entangled state might be Bell nonlo-
cal in this broader sense. Something similar is expected to
happen with steerable assemblages. However, the conditions
for nonlocality of assemblages in more general measurement
scenarios are outside the scope of the present contribution.
Conditions for Bell violations.— Before our ﬁrst theorem,
we need to introduce some notation. Since dim(H) = 2,

(11)

We emphasize that Eqs.

(9) and (10) involve no opti-
mization over the set of measurements. The measurements
(11) are readily the solution to an optimization over general
(POVM) dichotomic measurements. Our criterion is hence
the equivalent for qubit assemblages of the famous criterion
of [18] for CHSH violation of 2-qubit states, with the differ-
ence that more generic Bell inequalities are covered here. In
fact, since the only signiﬁcant restriction is that Bob’s mea-
surement should have 2 outputs, Criterion 1 applies to many
of the most-widely used Bell inequalities, such as the CHSH
[29] and chained [30, 31] inequalities, as well as the I3322 in-
equality (together with its variants for more outputs for Alice
or more inputs for both) [32]. Moreover, it straightforwardly
generalizes to N-partite assemblages [34, 35] with a single

4

trusted part, covering, e.g., important multipartite [36] and
genuinely multipartite [37–39] Bell inequalities, as well as
(N − 1)-sided DI genuine N-partite entanglement witnesses
[40, 41].

Conditions for 2-input-2-output Bell nonlocality.— As a
crucial application of Criterion 1, we focus on the case of
dichotomic inputs and outputs for both parties. In this sce-
nario, Bell nonlocality is equivalent to a CHSH violation
[33]. Thus, applying Criterion 1 to the CHSH inequality,
we automatically get a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
nonlocality of arbitrary qubit assemblages under dichotomic
measurements with dichotomic outcomes. This is formalized
by the following corollary, whose proof we leave for App. B
(where, in addition, the CHSH inequality is provided).

Criterion 2 (Criterion for 2-input-2-output nonlocality). Let
Ξ be a generic assemblage with i = 2 inputs and o = 2
outputs per party. Then, Ξ is Bell local if, and only if,

Connection to steering inequalities.— In Ref. [25] a steer-
ing inequality for correlators was derived. There, it was
shown that, if B0 and B1 are any two out of the three Pauli
operators in an arbitrary basis of H and Ξ is unsteerable, then

Ref. [27], the authors found out that a violation of Eq. (14)
implies not only that Ξ is steerable but also that it violates
the CHSH inequality (under some measurements for Bob not
necessarily corresponding to B0 and B1).

We can understand the latter implication in the light of
Criterion 2. To this end, we note (see App. C) that Eq. (12)
can be recast as

(cid:104)(A0 + A1)By(cid:105)2 +

(cid:104)(A0 − A1)By(cid:105)2 ≤ 2 ,

where B2 is the third Pauli operator complementary to B0
and B1. Clearly, the left-hand side (lhs) of Eq. (15) is greater
or equal than that of Eq. (14). As a consequence, a violation
of Eq. (14) implies a violation (15) and, therefore, of (12),
consistent with the ﬁndings of Ref. [27].

The difference, of course, is that a violation of Eq. (15)
does not in general imply a violation of Eq. (14). So, while
the former gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for 2-
input-2-output Bell nonlocality, the latter only provides a
sufﬁcient one. Interestingly, one can show (see App. C) that,
in the basis of H in which the Bloch-sphere directions asso-
ciated to B0 and B1 are contained in the plane of topt
and
topt
, the correlators involving B2 in Eq. (15) vanish and the
1
lhss of Eq. (15) and Eq. (14) thus coincide (see Fig. 1).
Conversely, this implies that for every 2-input-2-output Bell
nonlocal assemblage there exists a pair of mutually unbiased

5

bases for which the steering in the assemblage is witnessed
via a violation of (14). This implication was very recently
formally proven in Refs. [50, 51] by other reasonings.

Concluding remarks.— We studied the problem of Bell
nonlocality versus quantum steering in the one-sided device-
independent framework of assemblages. We derived a
closed-form necessary and sufﬁcient criterion for any bipar-
tite qubit assemblage to violate – under general dichotomic
trusted measurements on the qubit – an arbitrary Bell in-
equality subject to very mild constraints and having arbitrar-
ily many outcomes for the untrusted party and settings for
both. The optimal measurements, over the set of dichotomic
POVMs, for the maximal violation were also provided and
turn out to be always rank-1 projective von Neumman mea-
surements. Our criterion is to assemblages what the famous
criterion of [18] for violation of the CHSH inequality is to
2-qubit states, with the difference that we treat more general
Bell inequalities. Indeed, many of the most-widely used Bell
inequalities [29–32] are within the ﬁrepower of our criterion.
For the particular case of 2 inputs and 2 outputs per user,
our criterion unambiguously characterizes all Bell nonlocal
correlations in the assemblage. In that setting, we showed
that, interestingly, the form of the criterion generalizes that

of steering inequalities recently obtained in Refs. [25, 27].
By this, we were able to shed light on the problem of EPR
steering detection within the framework of Bell nonlocality.
Finally, our criterion is generalizable to the case of N-
partite assemblages [34, 35] with a single trusted part, so as
to cover important multipartite [36] and genuinely multipar-
tite [37–39] Bell inequalities, as well as (N − 1)-sided DI
genuine N-partite entanglement witnesses [40, 41]. All our
results hold for the usual scenario of non-sequential mea-
surements on a single copy of the assemblage. A question
that we leave open is that of the conditions for Bell violations
and Bell nonlocality in more general measurement scenarios
[44–49]. Our ﬁndings constitute a powerful tool for the study
of the interplay between EPR steering and Bell nonlocality,
with potential implications in forthcoming research.

is known that, to test for Bell nonlocality of quantum states,
it sufﬁces to examine only von Neumann (rank-1 projective)
measurements [52]. The same happens for Bell violations by
assemblages, which we formalize with the following lemma.
Lemma A1 (Von Neumman measurements are optimal for
dichotomic Bell violations). Let {β, βL} be an arbitrary
well-behaved Bell inequality with dichotomic outputs for
Bob and Ξ a generic qubit assemblage. Then, the maximal
violation of {β, βL} by Ξ is attained under rank-1 projective
measurements.

Proof.— Our proof strategy consists in showing that, for
an arbitrary assemblage Ξ and generic dichotomic POVM
measurements M, the distribution P Ξ, given by Eq. (A1),
obtained from Ξ under M, is equivalent to a distribution ˜P Ξ
– obtained from Ξ under a set ˜M of von Neumann mea-
surements – followed by a local mixing of Bob’s outputs.
Since {β, βL} is well behaved, this implies that if P Ξ vio-
lates {β, βL}, i.e. if β · P Ξ > βL, then β · ˜P Ξ ≥ β · P Ξ,

which implies that the maximal violation is always attained
under von Neumann measurements.
Since, for all y ∈ [i], the POVM measurement operators
are both non-negative, they can be diagonal-

Now, deﬁning the distribution ˜P Ξ such that ˜PΞ(a, b(cid:48)|x, y) :=

, we can write

q(b|b(cid:48), y) ˜PΞ(a, b(cid:48)|x, y) .

(A5)

This, as evident from Eq. (6), is the expression of a local
mixing of Bob’s outputs applied to the von Neumann mea-
surement distribution ˜PΞ.

We can now continue with the proof of Criterion 1. Due to
Lemma A1, we need to maximize the Bell expression (A1)
only over the set of von Neumann measurements, i.e., with
measurement operators M (b)

y of the form

with respect to a ﬁxed basis of H of one’s preference, so that
the vectors ˆsy are the only variables of the optimization.
{ˆsy}y∈[i] are all independent, we get

Using Eqs. (A1) and (A6), and the fact that the vectors

(cid:88)

Note that Ay coincides with the expression inside the brack-
ets of Eq. (10). Then, using that Tr[Ay ˆsy · σ] = r(Ay) · ˆsy,
with the vector function r deﬁned in Eq. (8), the maximiza-
tion is ﬁnally reduced to

max{ˆsy} Tr [Ay ˆsy · σ] = max{ˆsy} r(Ay) · ˆsy .

(A9)

Clearly, the maximum is

(A12)

Substituting Eq. (A12) into Eq. (A6), one obtains the opti-
mal measurement settings of Eq. (11). Using, in turn, Eqs.
(A10) and (A11), one sees that Eq. (A7) is equivalent to the
left-hand side of Eq.(9).

Appendix B: Proof of Criterion 2

In the 2-input, 2-output scenario, by virtue of Fine’s the-
orem [33], Bell nonlocality is equivalent to the violation of
the CHSH inequality, given by

(cid:104)A0 B0(cid:105) + (cid:104)A0 B1(cid:105) + (cid:104)A1 B0(cid:105) − (cid:104)A1 B1(cid:105) ≤ 2 ,

(A13)

change, or by doing both). So, it sufﬁces to show that a vio-
lation of Eq. (12) is equivalent to the violation of any of the
8 symmetries of the CHSH inequality.

In the notation of Eq. (5), the CHSH inequality (A13) is

expressed as

βa,b,x,y = (−1)a+b(−1)x y and βL = 2,

(A14)

y

with i = 2 = o. Its symmetries, in turn, are obtained by
replacing x or y by their negations modulo 2, by applying an
overall sign change to {β, βL}, and by applying any compo-
sition of the three.

Substituting Eq. (A14) in Eqs. (9) and (10) leads to Eqs.
(12) and (13), as the reader can straightforwardly verify. This
shows that the violation of Eq. (12), with the measurement
given by Eq. (13), is equivalent to the viola-
direction topt
tion of the CHSH inequality (A13). Now, note that any of the
other symmetries mentioned above either does not explicitly
introduce any change in Eqs. (12) and (13) or simply cor-
responds to the relabelings topt
y , for
all y ∈ [2], or compositions of the two. None of the latter
alters the statements of Criterion 2. That is, the violation of
given by Eq. (13), is equivalent to the
Eq. (12), with topt
violation of any of the symmetries of the CHSH inequality,
which ﬁnishes the proof.

where ˆvα = ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz, for α = 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

It is now straightforward to see, from the deﬁnition of the
Euclidian norm, that Eq. (12) is equivalent to Eq. (15) for

{B0, B1, B2} the Pauli operators in any basis of H. Further-
more, one can also see that the lhs of inequality (14) is equiv-
alent to the lhs of inequality (12) evaluated at the projections
