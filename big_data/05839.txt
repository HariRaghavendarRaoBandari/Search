Abstract

We investigate solutions (M , g) to Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equations
with positive cosmological constant Λ which admit a smooth past null
inﬁnity I − `a la Penrose and a Killing vector ﬁeld whose associated Mars-
Simon tensor (MST) vanishes. The main purpose of this work is to pro-
vide a characterization of these spacetimes in terms of their Cauchy data
on I −.

Along the way, we also study spacetimes for which the MST does
not vanish. In that case there is an ambiguity in its deﬁnition which is
captured by a scalar function Q. We analyze properties of the MST for
diﬀerent choices of Q. In doing so, we are led to a deﬁnition of “asymptot-
ically Kerr-de Sitter-like spacetimes”, which we also characterize in terms
of their asymptotic data on I −.

Introduction

This is the ﬁrst in a series of at least two papers [22] in which we (resp. some
of us) analyze the asymptotic structure, and a certain initial value problem, for
vacuum solutions of Einstein’s equations

Rµν = Λgµν

(1.1)

on a 4-dimensional spacetime (M , g), where g is smooth and Λ is a (“cosmo-
logical”) constant. We focus on the case Λ > 0 but compare occasionally with
Λ = 0. Spacetime indices are greek, while coordinates in 1 + 3 splits are denoted
by {xα} = {t, xi} (rather than {x0, xi}), with corresponding tensorial indices.

through which the unphysical metric eg and the conformal factor Θ can be

smoothly extended. I is a smooth, not necessarily connected, hypersurface
which consists of two subsets: Future and past null inﬁnity, distinguished by
the absence of endpoints of past or future causal curves contained in (M , g),
In this paper we will normally denote by I − and I + chosen
respectively.

initial value results in this paper starting from I − have obvious “ﬁnal value
counterparts” obtained via replacing I − by I +, “future” by “past”, etc.

In this setting, Friedrich [10, 11] has shown that, in terms of suitable vari-
ables, the ﬁeld equations (1.1) become a regular, symmetric hyperbolic system

and key properties of Cαβγδ and edαβγδ are the following:

These properties, together with stability of solutions of symmetric hyper-
bolic systems, are the key ingredients in uniqueness and stability results of

asymptotically simple spacetimes (fM ,eg) as deﬁned in Def. 9.1. of [12]; the
latter deﬁnition includes the requirements that (fM ,eg) has a compact Cauchy

hypersurface and every maximally extended null geodesic has a past endpoint
on I − and a future endpoint on I +. We give here ﬁrst a uniqueness result for
de Sitter spacetime and then a sketchy version of the stability result (Thm 9.8
of [12]) which applies in particular to de Sitter.

Theorem 1.1

ple spacetime (fM ,eg), then any data for the MCFE on I − which are close
to the data for (fM ,eg) (in terms of suitable Sobolev norms) evolve to an

asymptotically simple spacetime.

A motivation for the present work is to generalize these uniqueness and
stability results to more general solutions of (1.1). Using again properties I.-III.

3

above, it is straightforward to generalize the above results on asymptotically
simple solutions to corresponding “semiglobal” results for any concrete family
of solutions, where “semiglobal” means the domain of dependence of I −. On
the other hand, and needless to say, any fully global results for solutions which
are not asymptotically simple but contain horizons and singularities involve
“cosmic censorship” issues and will be very complicated. The main targets of
the present work are Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) and Kerr-de Sitter (KdS)
spacetimes for which the topology of each connected component of I is R× S2.
Our main achievement is a semiglobal uniqueness result, namely Thm. 1.3, for a
class of solutions which includes Kerr- de Sitter. What makes our result highly
non-trivial is its particular formulation which we expect to be useful for the fully
global problem, for reasons given below.

In this uniqueness result, and from now onwards, we assume that (M , g)

admits a non-trivial Killing vector ﬁeld (KVF) X,

(LX g)µν ≡ 2∇(µXν) = 0 .

(1.4)

Since X µ is a KVF, Fµν := ∇µXν is a two-form: F(µν) = 0.
The main purpose of this assumption is to achieve a simpliﬁcation and to
permit the use of a special technique. However, as an aside we note that the
existence of the isometry might change the character of the stability problem
substantially. To see this on a heuristic basis, consider data for the MCFE on
I − which are at the same time Killing initial data, and which are close to Kerr-
de Sitter in a suitable sense. Now consider the time-evolution of such data, and
assume that the spacetime can be extended beyond its (“cosmological”) Cauchy
horizon (as it is the case for Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter). In this
extension, the isometry should become timelike, and now another conjecture,
namely uniqueness of stationary black-holes, should lead to Kerr-de Sitter in the
region between the event and the cosmological horizon. Extending backwards to
the domain of dependence of I − suggests that the “near Kerr-de Sitter” data
will actually be Kerr-de Sitter in the above setting. Accordingly, the existence of
the isometry, together with reasonable global assumptions, can turn a stability
into a uniqueness problem. This “eﬀect” is of course familiar from uniqueness
results for stationary, asymptotically ﬂat solutions.

While obtaining global results sketched above is far beyond our present
scope, it motivates our local analysis, in particular the use of the so-called
Mars-Simon tensor (MST) [19, 20, 32] in Thm 1.3. This tensor is deﬁned as
follows.

In these expressions ηµνσρ is the volume form of g, ⋆ the corresponding Hodge
dual and Q is a function. Fµν and Cαβγδ are self-dual, i.e. they satisfy F ⋆
µν =
−iFµν and C⋆
αβγδ = −iCαβγδ. The symmetric double two-form Iµνσρ plays a
natural role as a metric in the space of self-dual two-forms, in the sense that
IµνσρW σρ = Wµν for any self-dual two-form Wµν. In connection with this def-
inition and its applications, there now arise naturally two a priori independent
problems:

1. Classify the solutions of (1.1) for which there exists a Q such that the

MST (1.5) vanishes.

2. Prescribe the function Q such that properties I. -III. above (or a subset

thereof) hold for the MST.

Problem 1 has been settled in [19, 20] for case Λ = 0, while the extension
to Λ 6= 0 was accomplished in [23]. The classes of solutions characterized in
this way include Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter, respectively, and these solutions can
in fact be singled out by supplementing the condition Sµνσρ = 0 with suitable
“covariant” conditions.

As to problem 2 for Λ = 0, one sets

Q = 6σ−1

(1.11)

in terms of the “Ernst potential” σ, deﬁned up to an additive complex constant
(called “σ-constant” henceforth) by

∂βσ = 2X αFαβ .

(1.12)

The corresponding MST then in fact satisﬁes a linear, homogeneous, sym-
metric hyperbolic system, irrespective of how the σ-constant has been chosen
[18].
In the asymptotically ﬂat setting the MST vanishes at inﬁnity (which
holds again for any choice of the σ-constant provided that the ADM mass is
non-zero); it vanishes for all Kerr solutions in particular. The σ-constant is
ﬁxed uniquely in a natural way by requiring the Ernst potential to vanish at
inﬁnity. We remark that this symmetric hyperbolic system, or rather the wave
equation which can be derived from it, has been used in uniqueness proofs for
stationary, asymptotically ﬂat black holes [1, 18].

In analogy with (1.3) we now deﬁne

δ := Θ−1Sαβγ

δ.

(1.13)

For Λ > 0, key properties of these tensors can be summarized as follows
(I.-III. is shown in the present work while IV. is a reformulation of a result of
[23]; II. and IV. in fact hold for any sign of the cosmological constant)

(gM ,eg) which is of “Fuchsian type” at I .

IV. When Sαβγδ is required to vanish identically for some Q, then Q = Q0 =

Q(ev).

Conditions I. - III. stated above for the MST should be compared with the
corresponding conditions stated earlier for the Weyl tensor. Unfortunately, or
maybe for a deeper reason, there appears to be no universal deﬁnition of Q
anymore which satisﬁes I. - III. simultaneously.

We proceed with explaining these ﬁndings in some detail, and with describing
their arrangement in the following sections. The function Q0 is introduced in
(2.59), and property I. is shown in Proposition 2.3. Next, Theorem 2.8 gives
αβγδ to vanish on
I . These conditions agree with conditions (i) and (ii) in Theorem 1.3 quoted
below.

On the other hand, in (4.19)-(4.21) we deﬁne a class of functions Q(ev)
αβγδ satisﬁes
a linear, homogeneous symmetric hyperbolic system, which gives property II
(and from which one readily derives a system of wave equations). For the

necessary and suﬃcient conditions on the data in order for eT (0)
for which we show in Section 4.4 that the corresponding MST S(ev)
rescaled tensor eT (ev)

αβγδ we then obtain equations of the same form on gM (cf.

Lemmas 4.13 and 4.11). The appropriate deﬁnition of Q(ev) involves a “σ-
(integration)-constant” (called “a” in (4.11)), and in analogy with the case
Λ = 0 mentioned before there is again a natural way (namely (4.31)) of ﬁxing
the constant from the asymptotic conditions. However, in contrast to the case

Λ = 0, the resulting S(ev)
αβγδ does not vanish automatically on I −, whence T (ev)
αβγδ
is not necessarily regular there. In Deﬁnition 4.5 we call solutions for which
T (ev)
αβγδ (with the optimal σ-constant) can be regularized on I − (and agrees
with eT (0)
ρ on I −) “asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter like”. This class can be
characterized in terms of the data as follows (this is a shortened version of
Thm. 4.3):

and a KVF X. Denote by Y the CKVF induced, in the conformally rescaled
spacetime, by X on I −.

The condition

holds if and only if Y j is a common eigenvector of bCij and Dij, where bCij is

the Cotton-York tensor (2.72) and Dij = dtitj|I −.

This now suggests considering a Cauchy problem for the MCFE on I −,
starting from asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter-like data. However, in contrast to

the evolution equation for the rescaled Weyl tensor edαβγδ, the coeﬃcients in the
evolution equation for eT (ev)
equations for S(ev)

αβγδ are not regular at I and even not necessarily so oﬀ
some neighborhood of I . (Non-regularities may occur already in the evolution
αβγδ). Regarding I , we are now dealing with a linear homoge-
neous Fuchsian symmetric hyperbolic system (Lemma 4.11). Adapting results
available in the literature, we prove in Lemma 4.14 a local uniqueness theorem
for regular solutions of a class of Fuchsian systems which includes the present
αβγδ|I − = 0, which
we call “Kerr-de Sitter-like”. Our preliminary uniqueness result, Lemma 4.15,

now yields local-in-time uniqueness of these solutions, and implies that S(ev)
αβγδ
vanishes near I −. However, this conclusion does not immediately extend to the
whole domain of dependence of I − since the evolution equation is manifestly
regular only in some neighborhood of (and excluding) I −. Nevertheless, the
required result does follow from the classiﬁcation results of [23], so S(ev)
αβγδ ≡ 0
indeed holds on the domain of dependence of I −.
Altogether this yields the following classiﬁcation result for Kerr-de Sitter like
spacetimes in terms of data on I −, which may be considered as counterpart of
the ﬁrst part of 1.1 above:

Theorem 1.3 Let (Σ, h) be a Riemannian 3-manifold which admits a CKVF Y
with |Y |2 > 0, complemented by a TT tensor Dij to asymptotic Cauchy data.
Then there exists a maximal globally hyperbolic Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime (M , g)
which admits a KVF X i with X i|I − = Y i and such that the associated MST
vanishes, and Σ represents past null inﬁnity I − with gij|I − = hij and dtitj|I − =
Dij if and only if

(i) bCij =q Λ

3|Y |2hij) for some constant Cel.

(ii) Dij = Cel|Y |−5(YiYj − 1
We remark that we do not obtain a counterpart to the stability result (part
2 of Thm. 1.1, since (to our knowledge) there is no general result guaranteeing
existence and stability of solutions to Fuchsian systems. Recall also the remark
after (1.4) in connection with the signiﬁcance of the stability problem in the
presence of isometries.

In the ﬁnal Section 5 we analyze the relations between the vanishing of the
rescaled MST (1.13) (or the corresponding condition on the data) and the exis-
tence of other conformal Killing vector ﬁelds on I , and we discuss the extension
of the latter to Killing vector ﬁelds on M . This result, given in Proposition 5.9,

hold irrespectively of the sign (or vanishing) of Λ.

Let us henceforth assume a positive cosmological constant

We consider a connected component I − of past null inﬁnity. As in [25], to which
we refer the reader for further details, we use adapted coordinates (x0 = t, xi)
with I − = {t = 0} and impose a wave map gauge condition with

known that the freedom to choose coordinates near a spacelike hypersurface

eR = 0 ,

The gauge freedom to prescribe eR andes|I − reﬂects the freedom to choose the

coeﬃcients, and the W σ’s are the gauge source functions, which can be arbi-
trarily prescribed [9]. The target metric is introduced for the wave gauge vector

to become a tensor. Here, as in [25], we have chosen ˇgµν to be independent

of t and to agree with egµν on I −. The gauge has been chosen in such a way
that ∂tegµν vanishes on I −, in order to make the computations as simple as

possible. Given arbitrary coordinates the wave map gauge can be realized by
solving wave equations.

Viewing the MCFE as an evolution problem with initial data on I −, the
free data are a (connected) Riemannian 3-manifold (Σ, hij), which represents
I − in the emerging spacetime,1 and a TT tensor Dij (i.e.: trace-free and
divergence-free) which satisﬁes the relation

Dij = edtitj|I −

Theorem 2.1 ([10]) Let (Σ, hij ) be a Riemanian 3-manifold, Dij a symmet-
ric (0, 2)-tensor and Λ > 0. Then, if and only if Dij is a TT tensor, the

2.3.1 A necessary condition for vanishing MST

Our aim is to characterize initial data on a spacelike I − which lead to a vanish-
ing MST. We have not speciﬁed the function Q yet. Nonetheless, let us assume
for the time being that Θ−4Q does not tend to zero at I . Then, it follows from
(2.10) and (2.15) that a necessary condition for the MST to vanish on I is

section we in fact show that

Q = O(Θ5)

(2.56)

2.3.2 Deﬁnition and asymptotic behavior of the MST
In order to analyze the situation where Sµνσρ vanishes, it is natural to deﬁne Q in
such a way that a certain scalar constructed from Sµνσρ vanishes automatically.
This tensor has the same algebraic properties as the Weyl tensor, so all its traces
are identically zero and cannot be used to deﬁne Q. A convenient choice is to
require

SµνσρF µνF σρ = 0 ,

(2.57)

or, equivalently,

QF 4 =

3
2F µνF σρCµνσρ = 6F µνF σρCµνσρ .

(2.58)

The function Q necessarily needs to satisfy (2.58) whenever the MST vanishes.
Let us restrict attention to the case where F 2 has no zeros.
In fact, F 2 =
− 4
3 ΛΘ−2|Y |2 + O(Θ−1), so, at least suﬃciently close to I , it suﬃces to assume
that Y has no zeros on I . Then (2.58) determines Q. From now on this choice
of Q will be denoted by Q0,

Conversely, contraction of (2.84) with Y i yields

that the corresponding KVF would vanish in the domain of dependence of that

vanish at some points. In this case the points where the conformal Killing vector

vanishing so we can prescribe the choice of square root at one point and extend
it by continuity to the whole manifold. Since F 2 does not vanish, no branch
point of the root is ever met and √F 2 is smooth everywhere. Moreover, the
function F 2 has strictly negative real part in a neighborhood of I (see (3.8)
3 Note that in the de Sitter case we have Cαβµν = 0 = Q0, so the MST associated to any

KVF vanishes identically.

below). We can thus ﬁx the square root √F 2 in this neighborhood by choosing

the positive branch near I , namely the branch that takes positive real numbers
and gives positive real values. We will use this prescription for any function
which is non-zero in a neighborhood of inﬁnity.

The following result is proven in [23, Theorems 4 & 6]

Theorem 3.1 Let (M , g) be a Λ-vacuum spacetime which admits a KVF X
such that the MST vanishes for some function Q. Assume further that the
functions QF 2 and QF 2 − 4Λ are not identically zero. Then:
(i) F 2 and QF 2 − 4Λ are nowhere vanishing,
(ii) Q is given by (2.59), i.e. Q = Q0, and

(iii) b1, b2, c and k are constant.

Remark 3.2 If Λ > 0 and (M , g) admits a smooth I , has vanishing MST and
is not locally isometric to the de Sitter spacetime, it follows from (3.5)-(3.8)
below that Q, F 2 and QF 2 − 4Λ will never be identically zero. In other words,
b1, b2, c and k are constant whenever the MST vanishes in a spacetime (M , g)
as above.

Combining Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.2 we obtain the following result:

Lemma 3.3 Let (M , g) be a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime which admits a KVF
X such that the associated MST vanishes for some Q. Assume further that
the function F 2 vanishes at least at one point and that (M , g) is not locally
isometric to the de Sitter spacetime. Then (M , g) does not admit a smooth I .

This lemma is interesting because the classiﬁcation of spacetimes with van-
ishing MST splits into two cases, namely when F 2 is not zero somewhere and
the case when F 2 ≡ 0. Only the ﬁrst case was considered in [23]. The result
above tells a priori that none of the spacetimes which belong to the second class
with Λ > 0, if they exist, will admit a smooth conformal compactiﬁcation.

The above functions (3.1)-(3.3), or rather their restrictions to I , turn out to
be crucial for the classiﬁcation of vacuum spacetimes with vanishing MST (and
conformally ﬂat I , cf. [22]). Our next aim will therefore be to ﬁnd explicit
expressions for them in terms of the data at I under the assumption that
the MST vanishes for some choice of Q. We wish to ﬁnd expressions at null
inﬁnity that make sense (and generally cease to be constant) for any Λ-vacuum
spacetime with a smooth conformal compactiﬁcation and a KVF.

Employing the relations collected in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5 we ﬁnd that,

under the assumption that the MST vanishes,

as functions which are intrinsically deﬁned on some Riemannian 3-manifold,
whence we are led to the following

The spacetime functions c and k, (3.2) and (3.3), have been introduced in
[23] in the setting of a vanishing MST, where they arise naturally as integra-

tion constants. Concerningbc(Y ) andbk(Y ), in general one cannot expect them

to be constant. However, let us assume that the Cotton-York tensor satisﬁes
condition (2.87). Our main result, Theorem 1.3, (which is a reformulation of
Theorem 4.16) now implies the following: Choosing an initial Dij according to
(2.82), (Σ, h) can be extended to a Λ > 0 vacuum spacetime for which Σ rep-
resents I − and to which Y extends as a KVF such that the associated MST
vanishes for some function Q. One then deduces from the results in [23] that c

Lemma 3.5 Let (Σ, h) be a Riemannian 3-manifold which admits a CKVF Y

(2.87) implies that this function is constant, but the proof via the extension of
(Σ, h) to a vacuum spacetime provides an elegant tool to prove that. As already

Λ > 0-vacuum spacetimes which admit a conformally ﬂat I and a KVF w.r.t.
which the associated MST vanishes [22].

and k, and therefore alsobc(Y ) andbk(Y ) are constant:
with |Y |2 > 0 and such that bCij = C|Y |−5(YiYj)tf with C constant. Then the
functionsbc(Y ) andbk(Y ) as given by (3.19) and (3.20) are constant.
In particular in the case of bk(Y ) it is far from obvious that the condition
indicated above, the constantsbc andbk play a decisive role in the classiﬁcation of
3.3 Constancy ofbc(Y )
Let us focus attention on the function bc(Y ). In Section 4.2 we will introduce

admits a CKVF Y , LY h = 2

and Σ is connected, then the proportionality function necessarily takes the form

H = C|Y |−5 where C is a constant, andbc(Y ) is constant over the manifold.

4 Evolution of the MST

4.1 The Ernst potential on I

In this section we make no assumption concerning the MST, so all the results
hold generally for any Λ-vacuum spacetime admitting a KVF X and a smooth
conformal compactiﬁcation.

Using the results of Section 2.1 the so-called Ernst one-form of X, σµ :=

2X αFαµ, has the following asymptotic expansion

Proposition 4.1 Consider a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime which admits a KVF
and a smooth I . Then the Ernst potential σ can be computed explicitly near
I , where it admits the expansion (4.18).

4.2 Alternative deﬁnition of the function Q

In order to derive evolution equations it is convenient (cf. [18] for the Λ = 0-case)
to deﬁne, for each Ernst potential σ, a new function Q = Qev by the following
set of equations,

Qev :=

3J

F 2 ,

.

and all square roots are chosen with the same prescription as explained

above, cf. p. 17. Alternatively, we could have deﬁned R = +(i/2)√F 2. Then

the expression for J would have changed accordingly. The choice (4.20) is
preferable because then the real part of R approaches minus inﬁnity at I , in

25

agreement with the usual behavior of Boyer-Lindquist type coordinates near
inﬁnity in Kerr-de Sitter and related metrics [23]. Note that the deﬁnition of J
above implies the identity

σJ 2 − 2JR + Λ = 0 ,

(4.22)

which will be useful later. The MST associated with the choice Q = Qev will
be denoted by S(ev)
µνσρ.

One remark is in order: In this section we do not assume that the MST vanishes,

(3.13), should be constant. From (4.18) and (4.25) we observe that

Remark 4.2 The expressions (4.27) and (4.28) for Qev rely on the choice of
√R2. The ﬁnal expression (4.29) is however independent of this choice,
R = −
as it must be. This ﬁnal expression ensures that, in an appropriate setting,
Qev coincides with Q0, as will be shown in Theorem 4.16.
It should also be
emphasized that this expression does not admit a limit Λ ց 0. This is because,
when Λ = 0, the function F 2 approaches zero at inﬁnity and the deﬁnition of
square root needs to be worked out diﬀerently.

We have

Qev =( 3

if a 6≡ c(xj ) + ip(xj) ,
if a ≡ c(xj ) + ip(xj) .

(4.30)

The rescaled MST with Q = Qev will be regular on I if and only if Qev =
O(Θ5), i.e. if and only if both functions c and p are constant and the σ-constant
a has been chosen such that

Re(a) = c

and Im(a) = p .

(4.31)

We remark that with this choice of a the function Qev is completely determined.
Note that the potential p will be constant if and only if the covector ﬁeld
Pi vanishes. The constancy of c has been analyzed in Lemma 3.6. Comparison
with (2.67) then leads to the following result, a shortened version of which has
been stated as Theorem 1.2 in the Introduction:

Theorem 4.3 Consider a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime4 which admits a smooth I −
and a KVF X. Denote by Y the CKVF induced, in the conformally rescaled
spacetime, by X on I −. If and only if

kbCklY jY l = 0 (so that the function c = 3

Λbc(Y ) is constant on I −),

kDklY jY l = 0 (so that Pi = 0 whence its potential p is constant),

there exists a unique σ-constant a, given by a = c + ip, which leads via Qev to
µνσρ which is regular at I −. In that case the leading order

terms of Qev = O(Θ5) and Q0 = O(Θ5) coincide,

4.3

(Asymptotically) KdS-like spacetimes

rescaled MST eT (ev)

In Theorem 4.3 we have obtained necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the
µνσρ to be regular at I −. As we shall see in Section 4.4.2, this
tensor satisﬁes a homogeneous symmetric hyperbolic Fuchsian system with data
prescribed at I −. The zero data is such that its propagation stays zero. The
resulting spacetime has vanishing MST and hence either a Kerr-de Sitter metric
or one of the related metrics classiﬁed in [23]. We call such spacetimes KdS-like:

Definition 4.5 Let (M , g) be a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime admitting smooth
conformal compactiﬁcation and corresponding null inﬁnity I . (M , g) is called
“Kerr-de Sitter-like” at a connected component I − of I if it admits a KVF X
µνσρ vanishes

which induces a CKVF Y on I −, such that the rescaled MST eT (ev)

4Since Pi needs to vanish in this setting, Pi is exact and we need not assume that I − is

at I −.

simply connected in order to get a globally deﬁned Ernst potential.

27

Note that also the Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime belongs to the class of
KdS-like space-times. In [22] we analyze in detail KdS-like space-times which
admit a conformally ﬂat I .

The case where the tensor eT (ev)

µνσρ is merely assumed to be ﬁnite at I −
obviously includes the zero case (i.e. Kerr-de Sitter and related metrics) and at
the same time excludes many other Λ-vacuum spacetimes with a smooth I −.
It makes sense to call such spacetimes asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter-like. We
put forward the following deﬁnition:

Definition 4.6 Let (M , g) be a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime admitting smooth
conformal compactiﬁcation and corresponding null inﬁnity I . (M , g) is called
“asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter-like” at a connected component I − of I if it ad-
mits a KVF X which induces a CKVF Y on I −, which satisﬁes |Y |2 > 0, such
that the conditions (i) and (ii) in Theorem 4.3 are satisﬁed, or, equivalently,

such that the rescaled MST eT (ev)

µνσρ is regular at I −.

Remark 4.7 As will be shown later (cf. Corollary 4.17), KdS-like space-times
have a vanishing MST, whence, as shown in Section 2.5, the condition |Y |2 > 0
follows automatically. In the asymptotically KdS-like case, though, the condi-
tions (i) and (ii) in Theorem 4.3 might be compatible with zeros of Y .

An interesting open problem is to classify “asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter-

like” spacetimes.

4.4 Derivation of evolution equations for the (rescaled)

MST

Based on the corresponding derivation for Λ = 0 in [18], we will show that the
MST

S(ev)
µνσρ = Cµνσρ + QevUµνσρ ,

(4.32)

with Qev as deﬁned in (4.19)-(4.21), satisﬁes a symmetric hyperbolic system of
evolution equations as well as a system of wave equations.

4.4.2 A symmetric hyperbolic system satisﬁed by the (rescaled)

MST

We now want to show that the equations (4.61) and (4.63) contain a system of
linear ﬁrst-order symmetric hyperbolic equations in their respective spacetimes.
Given that (4.61) and (4.63) have exactly the same structure, it is enough to
perform the analysis for any one of the two systems, or to a model equivalent

system in a given spacetime. Then, a further analysis of the regularity of the
system (4.63) near I is also needed, and this will be done later in this section.

MST satisﬁes all the algebraic symmetries of the rescaled Weyl tensor we ﬁnd
that this system is equivalent to (cf. [18, 27])

(4.66)

Observe that each of (4.64) and (4.66) contains 8 complex (16 real) in-
dependent equations for only 5 complex (10 real) unknowns, hence they are
overdetermined.

Systems of this type have been analyzed many times in the literature (in
order to see if they comprise a symmetric hyperbolic system), especially in
connection with the Bianchi identities [6, 7]. Here, to check that the systems
(4.64), or (4.66), and therefore (4.61) and (4.63), contain symmetric hyperbolic
evolution equations we use the general ideas exposed in [16], which were applied
to systems more general than –and including– those of type (4.64) or (4.66) and
discussed at length in [31]. The goal is to ﬁnd a “hyperbolization”, in the sense
of [16]. To that end, simplifying the calculations in [31], pick any timelike vector
vµ and contract (4.64) with

− v[αδν

β]v[γv[δδµ]

ǫ]

and add the result to the contraction of (4.66) with

By construction, the righthand side of (4.69) is linear in Jγµν(S) and a fortiori
linear in Sγµνρ, so that its explicit expression is unimportant. The system (4.69)
is symmetric hyperbolic. To prove it, we have to check two properties of Qτ λνγµ
αβδǫ :
it must be Hermitian in λνγµ ↔ αβδǫ, and there must exist a one-form uτ such
that its contraction with Qτ λνγµ

αβδǫ is positive deﬁnite.

31

The ﬁrst condition can be easily checked by ﬁrst noticing that Qτ λνγµ

αβδǫ hap-
pens to be real and then contracting it with two arbitrary self-dual trace-free
double (2,2) forms, say Aλνγµ and Bαβδǫ. The result is

which is manifestly symmetric under the interchange of A and B. Thus, the
matrix of the system (4.69) is Hermitian.

With regard to the second condition, we contract Qτ λνγµ

,
and with uτ . We stress that in this section an overbar means “complex conju-
gation” rather than “restriction to I ”. We get

and note that the expression in brackets is precisely the Bel-Robinson su-
perenergy tensor tτ βλµ of the self-dual Weyl-type tensor Aαβλµ [27, 30].
It
is known that this tensor satisﬁes the dominant property [27, 30], that is,
3 , vµ
2 , vλ
tτ βλµvτ
4 .
Thus, the previous expression is positive for any timelike uτ with the same time
orientation as vτ , as required. Actually, by choosing uτ = vτ it becomes (twice)

which is non-negative, vanishing if and only if so does the full Aαβλµ [30].
In order to see the relation between the found symmetric hyperbolic system
(4.69) and the original equations (4.64) or (4.66), we take into account that
Qτ λνγµ
αβδǫ is non-degenerate as an operator acting on 2-forms in its ”γµ, δǫ” part
so that (4.69) is actually fully equivalent to

3vλ∇[λSτ ν]γµ + 2∇ρSγµ[ν

ρvτ ] = ivλJγµσ(S)ησ

λτ ν + 2Jγµ[ν(S)vτ ] .

There is some redundancy here due to the equivalence of (4.64) and (4.66). To
optimize the expression of this symmetric hyperbolic system we note that, via
the identity (4.65), it can be rewritten as

which is easily seen to be equivalent to

(cid:0)∇ρSγµ[ν

ρ − Jγµ[ν(S)(cid:1) vτ ] = 0
ρ − Jγµ[ν(S)(cid:1) vτ ] = 0

with vβ any timelike vector. The linear symmetric hyperbolic set (4.71) consti-
tutes the evolution equations of our system. Note that, taking into account trace
and symmetry properties, there are precisely 5 complex (10 real) independent
equations in (4.71), which is the number of independent unknowns.

The complete system (4.64) is re-obtained by adding the constraints, which
can be written for any given spacelike hypersurface Σ with timelike normal nµ
as (cf. [31], section 4)

nν (∇ρSγµν

ρ − Jγµν(S)) = 0 .

(4.72)

32

(4.71)

Notice, ﬁrst of all, that only derivatives tangent to Σ appear in (4.72). Observe
furthermore that (4.72) contains 3 complex (6 real) independent equations which
adds up with (4.71) to the number of equations of the original system (4.64),
rendering the former two equations fully equivalent with the latter one. To
check this directly, contract (4.71) with vτ to get

(−v2δσ

ν + vσvν ) (∇ρSγµσ

ρ − Jγµσ(S)) = 0 ,

where

hσ

γ := δσ

γ − v−2vγvσ

(4.73)

is the projector orthogonal to vµ, which immediately leads to (4.64) by taking
into account (4.72)— e.g., by simply choosing vµ pointing along nµ.

As mentioned before, (4.71) contains 5 equations for the 5 complex indepen-
ρ. A convenient way of explicitly expressing this fact is

dent unknowns in Sγµσ
by recalling the following identity

Sαβλµ = 2(cid:2)(hα[λ − v−2vαv[λ)Eµ]β + (hβ[µ − v−2vβv[µ)Eλ]α
σ(cid:3)
σ − iv−2vρηραβσv[λEµ]

−iv−2vρηρλµσv[αEβ]

in terms of the spatial “electric-magnetic” tensor deﬁned for any timelike vτ by

Eβµ := −v−2vαvλSαβλµ.

(4.74)

Observe the following properties

Eβµ = Eµβ, Eβµvµ = 0, E µ

µ = 0.

Thus, Eβµ contains 5 complex independent components and exactly the same
ρ. Note that the density (4.70) is then expressed
information as the full Sγµσ
simply as

Wv(S) = EµνE

µν

.

(4.75)

In any orthonormal basis with its timelike ‘t’-part aligned with vµ, the ﬁve
independent components of Eµν are given simply by
Stijl = iηt

Eij = Stitj ,

where the second equation follows from the self-duality of S. Using this, the

Remark 4.9 An alternative route to arrive at the same result is by using
spinors, see [9, 13].
In this formalism [27] the (rescaled) MST is represented
by a fully symmetric spinor ΥABCD, and equations (4.64) are written in the
following form

∇A

A′ΥABCD = LA′BCD

µνσ

where LA′BCD = LA′(BCD) is the spinor associated to Jγµν(S). Then this is
easily put in symmetric hyperbolic form, writing it as in [13], section 4, for the
Bianchi equations.
Remark 4.10 Note that the denominator QevF 2 + 8Λ in the equation (4.59)
for S(ev)
ρ might have zeros. Furthermore, the Ernst potential may have zeros
so that Qev blows up. An analogous problem arises for eT (ev)
ρ, cf. (4.84) below.
In fact, it follows from (4.18), (4.78), (4.80) and (4.92) below, that this cannot
happen suﬃciently close to I (for Λ > 0). It is not clear, though, whether the
evolution equations remain regular oﬀ some neighborhood of I .
Moreover, it will be shown in the subsequent section that J (eT (ev))αβµ is

As explained in the previous section the system (4.63) splits into a symmetric
hyperbolic system of evolution equations and a system of constraint equations

way to realize such a gauge is to impose the condition (4.88) also oﬀ the initial

for eT (ev)

egtt = −1 ,

egti = 0 .

It is well known that these Gaussian normal coordinates [34] are obtained by
shooting geodesics normally to I ; the coordinate t is then chosen to be an aﬃne
parameter along these geodesics, while the coordinates {xi} are transported
from I by requiring them to be constant along these geodesics.

4.5 Uniqueness for the evolution equation for eT (ev)

Existence of solutions of quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic Fuchsian systems
with prescribed asymptotics at I has been analyzed in the literature mainly
in the analytic case. For the merely smooth case, there exist results by Claudel
& Newman [8], Rendall [29], and more recently Ames et.al. [3, 4]. The results
in these papers involve a number of algebraic requirements, as well as global
conditions in space. It is an interesting problem to see whether any of these
results can be adapted to our setting here, in particular in order to prove a
ν is
prescribed on some domain B of I − and existence and uniqueness of a corre-
sponding solution is shown in the domain of dependence of B. This would also
require studying the impact of the constraint equations and their preservation
under evolution.

4.5.1 A localized uniqueness theorem for symmetric hyperbolic Fuch-

sian systems

Let (M , ˜g) be an (n+1)-dimensional spacetime and I a spacelike hypersurface.
Choose coordinates in a neighborhood of I so that I = {t = 0}, and the metric
is such that ˜gtt = −1 and ˜gti = 0, i = 1,··· , n. Let us consider the ﬁrst order,
homogenous linear symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs

N u = 0

(4.112)

where u : M 7→ Cm is the unknown, At, Ai and N are m × m matrices which
depend smoothly on the spacetime coordinates (t, xi). We assume that Cm
is, at each spacetime point (t, x), endowed with a positive deﬁnite sesquilinear
product hu, vi such that the endomorphisms Aµ(t, x), for µ = t, i, are Hermitian
with respect to this product

hu, Aµvi =DA

µ

u, vE .

Deﬁne N0(x) := N (t = 0, x). Our main assumption is that At + N0 is strictly
positive deﬁnite with respect to h , i at every point p ∈ I . Since both the inner
product and N depend smoothly on t and x, the same holds for a suﬃciently
small spacetime neighborhood of any point p ∈ I . The domain of dependence
of (4.112) is deﬁned in the usual way (namely, the standard deﬁnition in terms
of causal curves, with causality at TpM being deﬁned as k ∈ TpM being future
timelike (causal) iﬀ kt > 0 and Aµ|pkµ is negative deﬁnite (semideﬁnite), where
assumption that k = ∂t is future timelike in this sense.

kµ is obtained from k by lowering indices with respect toeg). We also make the

We want to prove that the PDE (4.112) with trivial initial data on a domain
B ⊂ I vanishes identically in the domain of dependence of B, denoted by
D(B). More precisely
Lemma 4.14 Let B ⊂ I be a domain with compact closure. Let u be a C1 map
u : M 7→ Cm which vanishes at B and solves (4.112). Assume that At and
At + N0 are positive deﬁnite, then u vanishes at D(B).

Proof: The proof is adapted from the basic energy estimate Lemma 2.7 in [3].
Since our setup is simpler, we can use a domain of dependence-type argument,
instead of a global-in-space argument as in [3, 4]. First note that since u vanishes
at t = 0, and it is C1,

∂tu|t=0,x = lim

t→0

u(t, x)

t

:= u1

with u1 : I 7→ Cm continuous. Taking the limit of (4.112) as t → 0 with
(0, x) ∈ B and using u(0, x) = 0 it follows

(At + N0)u1 = 0

=⇒

u1 = 0 ,

because At +N0 is positive deﬁnite, and hence has trivial kernel. Let us consider

where in the ﬁrst equality we have used that Aµ is Hermitian w.r.t. h , i and in
the second equality we have used the fact that u satisﬁes (4.112). Consider now a
domain V ⊂ M bounded by three smooth hypersurfaces-with-boundary B ⊂ I ,
BT ⊂ {t = T} and Σ, whose union is a compact topological hypersurface. Note
that B and BT are spacelike (i.e. their normal is timelike). We choose V so
that Σ is achronal and that its outward normal (deﬁned as the normal one-form
which contracted with any outward directed vector is positive) is past causal.
Consider the domain Vǫ = V ∩ {t ≥ ǫ} for ǫ > 0 small enough. The boundary
splits as ∂Vǫ = Bǫ ∪ Σǫ ∪ BT , with obvious notation.
We integrate ∂µZ µ on Vǫ with respect to the spacetime volume form η =
F dtdx and use the Gauss identity. Denote by n an outward normal to ∂V , then

where dS is the induced volume form on ∂V corresponding to the choice of
normal n. Note in particular that, as a vector, nµ points inwards both on Bǫ
and on BT , so they can be taken simply to be n = ∂t on Bǫ and n = −∂t on
BT , i.e. n = −dt on Bǫ and n = dt on BT . Inserting (4.113) and splitting the

versely, if (i) and (ii) hold, it follows from Theorem 4.3 and Theorem 2.8 that
there exists a choice of the σ-constant a in Qev for which the rescaled MST
αβµν vanishes on I −. It then follows from Lemma 4.15 that it vanishes in
some neighborhood of I −. However, once we know that the MST vanishes in
such neighborhood, it follows from the results in [23] that the metric has to take
one of the local forms given there. But for all these metrics the MST vanishes
globally. So we can conclude that it vanishes in fact in the whole domain of
dependence of I −.

5.2 Properties of the KID equations

In this section we study the case where the KID equations on a spacelike I −
of a Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime admit at least two solutions, as it is the case for
e.g. Kerr-de Sitter, or, more generally, for spacetimes with vanishing MST [23].

Recall the KID equations [25]

LY Dij +

3

Dijb∇kY k = 0 .

Consider two CKVFs Y and ζ on the Riemannian 3-manifold (I −, h) which
both assumed to solve the KID equations. Then also their commutator, which
is obviously a CKVF, provides another (possibly trivial) solution of the KID
equations,

(5.24)

(5.25)

L[Y,ζ]Dij +

1
3

Dijb∇k[Y, ζ]k = 0 .

This reﬂects the well-known fact that KVFs together with the commutator form
a Lie algebra.

Let us continue assuming that Y and ζ are two CKVFs on (I −, h) which
solve the KID equations, and let us further assume that Dij satisﬁes condition
(2.82) (in particular, we assume |Y |2 > 0). Then the KID equations (5.24) for
ζ can be written as (set V := [Y, ζ] and assume Cel 6= 0)

2Y(iVj) + (hij − 5|Y |−2YiYj)YkV k = 0 .

Contraction with Y j yields

Another contraction with Y i gives

0 = |Y |2Vi − 3YiYjV j .

Y kVk = 0 .

Inserting this into (5.27) we ﬁnd that (5.26) is equivalent to

V = [Y, ζ] = 0 .

We have proven the following:

(5.27)

(5.28)

(5.29)

Lemma 5.6 Let (I −, hij) be a Riemannian 3-manifold which admits a CKVF
Y with |Y |2 > 0. Denote by (M , gµν) the Λ > 0-vacuum spacetime constructed
from the initial data hij and Dij = Cel|Y |−5(YiYj − 1
3|Y |2hij), Cel 6= 0. Then
any other vector ﬁeld on (I −, hij ) extends to a KVF of (M , gµν ) if and only if
it is a CKVF of (I −, hij) which commutes with Y .

Remark 5.7 Note that the unphysical Killing equations imply that a KVF in
the physical spacetime can be non-trivial if and only if the induced CKVF on
I is non-trivial (compare [25]).

Remark 5.8 Assume that I is conformally ﬂat. Then it can be shown that
there exists at least one independent CKVF ζ which commutes with Y . It then
follows from Lemma 5.6 that the emerging spacetime admits at least two KVFs.
This provides a simple proof that Λ > 0-vacuum spacetimes with vanishing MST
and conformally ﬂat I have at least two KVFs (cf. [23, Theorem 4]).

Moreover, we have the following

Proposition 5.9 Let (Σ, hij) be a Riemannian 3-manifold which admits a CKVF

Y with |Y |2 > 0. Assume further that its Cotton-York tensor satisﬁes bCij =
C|Y |−5(YiYj − 1
3|Y |2hij), C = const. Then (Σ, hij) admits a second, indepen-
dent CKVF ζ which commutes with Y .

Proof: One more time we use a spacetime argument: There exists a Λ >
0-vacuum spacetime (M , gµν ) with a KVF X such that the associated MST
vanishes, such that (Σ, hij ) can be identiﬁed with past null inﬁnity, and such
that X i|Σ = Y i. It follows from the classiﬁcation results in [23] that (M , gµν)
admits a second independent KVF which commutes with X, and which induces
a CKVF on I − with the asserted properties.
✷

Remark 5.10 The second CKVF ζ may or may not be ς as given in Deﬁnition
5.1. The statement of the Proposition is that, even when ς happens to be
linearly dependent to Y , there is still another independent CKVF on (Σ, hij).

Proposition 5.9 might be useful to classify Riemannian 3-manifolds which

admit a CKVF which is related to the Cotton-York tensor via (2.74).
