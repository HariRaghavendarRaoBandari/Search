Abstract. We give a geometric and graded version of parabolic induction for
modules of semi-simple complex Lie algebras in the BGG-category O in terms
of stratiﬁed mixed Tate motives on the corresponding ﬂag varieties. We also
describe the eﬀect of parabolic induction on the level of Soergel modules.

1. Introduction

1.1. Parabolic Induction. Let g be a semi-simple complex Lie algebra, for ex-
ample sln(C). Choose some parabolic subalgebra p ⊂ g and denote its reductive
Levi factor by l. From any l-module M we can construct a g-module Indg
p M by
extending M trivially on the nilradical of p and then inducing it up. This process
is called parabolic induction and is of general interest in representation theory.

This article is concerned with parabolic induction of modules in regular integral
blocks of category O (see [BGG71], [Hum08]). Translation functors reduce the
situation to the study of a family of functors {Indw} between the principal blocks

Indw := Indg

p Tw·0

0

: O0(l) → O0(g)

parametrised by shortest right coset representatives w of the quotient of the Weyl
groups of g and l.

Our main goal is to provide a geometric and graded version of the functors Indw

in the following sense:

Denote by X and Y the full ﬂag varieties of the Langlands dual algebraic groups
corresponding to g and l. The mixed geometry of these varieties is – via the homo-
topy category of Soergel modules – intimately related to the derived category O’s
of g and l (see [BG86], [Soe90] and [BGS96]). This is made most precise in [SW14]

which provides us with categories Derb,Z
mixed Tate motives on X and Y . They are equivalent to the categories Derb(OZ
and Derb(OZ

(A)(Y ) of so called stratiﬁed
0 (g))

(B)(X) and Derb,Z

0 (l)) of [BGS96]. We denote the functor forgetting the grading by v.

The big advantage of mixed Tate motives is that they are equipped with a
w} by

six-functor formalism. We can hence construct a family of functors {hw,∗p!

Our main result is:

The functors hw,∗p!

of the Indw.

1.2. Soergel Modules and Plan of Proof. In order to proof Theorem 1 we need
to work through the deﬁnition of the degrading maps v which involve as an inter-
mediate step the homotopy category of (graded) Soergel modules. So let CI and C
be the cohomology rings of Y and X. Denote by the preﬁx Proj the full subcategory
of projective modules and by the index w = 0 the full subcategory and weight 0
complexes, see [SW14]. Let furthermore VI and V be the Kombinatorik-functors of
O0(l) and O0(g) (see [Soe90]) as well as HI and H be the hypercohomology functors
for Y and X. If we expand the deﬁnition of the degrading functors v we obtain the
following diagram.

Theorem 2. Let w = s1 · · · sn be a reduced expression of w such that also s1 · · · si
is a shortest right coset representative for all i. Then on the homotopy category
of (evenly graded) Soergel modules both Indw and hw,∗p!
w induce (up to natural
isomorphism) the same functor

where Rsi denotes the Rouquier complex of si.

Theorem 2 immediately implies Theorem 1. We will prove it using induction on

the length of w.

1.3. Structure of the paper. Section 2 will be concerned with category O. We
mainly analyse the interaction of parabolic induction and translation and wall cross-
ing functors.

Section 3 is about the mixed geometry. We deﬁne the maps pw and hw and
sπs,! of wall crossing

w with the geometric analogues π!

study the interaction of hw,∗p!
functors.

In Section 4 we study the eﬀect of Indw and hw,∗p!

w on the homotopy category

of Soergel modules and prove Theorem 1 and 2.

tive discussions and posing the questions treated in this article. I was ﬁnancially

etry”.

2. Representation Theory

We need to ﬁrst ﬁx a lot of notation which is mostly taken from [Hum08, Chapter
9.1.]. Let g ⊃ b ⊃ h be a semi-simple complex Lie algebra with a ﬁxed Borel and
Cartan subalgebra. Denote by h∗ ⊃ Φ ⊃ Φ+ ⊃ ∆ the corresponding root system,
positive and simple roots and by W ⊃ S the associated Weyl group and simple
reﬂections. Each subset I ⊂ ∆ deﬁnes a root system ΦI ⊂ Φ with positive and
negative roots Φ+
I and Weyl group WI ⊂ W generated by simple reﬂections
SI = {sα|α ∈ I}. It also deﬁnes a standard parabolic subalgebra

I and Φ−

p = pI = h ⊕ M

gα,

α∈ΦI ∪Φ+

with nilradical u and reductive Levi factor l = lI . Denote by [l, l] =: gI ⊃ bI ⊃ hI
the maximal semi-simple subalgebra of l with its Borel and Cartan subalgebra and
by z ⊂ h the center of l.

In the following assume all weights to be integral. An integral weight λ will be
called ∆-dominant if hλ + ρ, αˇi ∈ Z≥0 for all α ∈ ∆ and I-dominant if hλ + ρ, αˇi ∈
Z≥0 for all α ∈ I. Here ρ is the sum of all fundamental weights.

We parametrise integral blocks of O(g) and O(l) by ∆-dominant and I-dominant
weights, respectively. For λ ∈ h∗ denote by MI(λ), LI(λ), PI (λ) and M (λ), L(λ),
P (λ) the Verma, simple and indecomposable projective module corresponding to λ
in O(l) and O(g).

Denote by U(−) the universal enveloping algebra. The functor Indg

p of parabolic

induction is deﬁned by
Indg

p : l - Mod → g - Mod, M 7→ U(g) ⊗U (p) M.

The goal of this section is to analyse the functorial properties of parabolic induction
when restricted to particular blocks of O(l) in Section 2.1 and to deﬁne the functors
Indw as well as to study their interaction with translation and wall-crossing functors
in Section 2.2.

GRADED PARABOLIC INDUCTION AND STRATIFIED MIXED TATE MOTIVES

2.1. Functorial properties of parabolic induction and blocks in O. Let us
recapitulate some standard facts about parabolic induction.

Lemma 3. 1.) Indg
2.) Indg

p is exact and restricts to a functor

p has a right adjoint given by M 7→ M u = {v ∈ M |uv = 0}.

3.) For all λ ∈ h∗ we have Indg

p(MI (λ)) = M (λ).

Indg

p : O(l) → O(g).

Now let us study how Indg

p acts on the blocks of O. Denote by W I the set of

shortest right coset representatives of WI \W.

Lemma 4. Let λ ∈ h∗ be ∆-dominant and regular. Then:
1.) We have

(Indg

p)−1(Oλ(g)) = M

w∈W I

Ow·λ(l).

2.) Indg
3.) Also Indg

p |Ow·λ(l) maps projective to projective modules if and only if w = e.

p |Oλ(l) is fully faithful and Indg

p PI (x · λ) = P (x · λ) for all x ∈ WI .

Proof. 1.) The I-dominant weights in the orbit W · λ are precisely the ones of the
form w · λ for w ∈ W I .
2.) The only if part is clear since Indg
p MI(w · λ) = M (w · λ) is only projective if
w = e. For the other direction we check that Indg
p |Oλ(l) has an exact right adjoint
functor. Denote by prλ the projection onto the block Oλ(l). Then prλ(−u) is right
adjoint to Indg
3.) By [SS15, Lemma 5.10] prλ(Indg
faithful and maps indecomposable projectives to such.

p |Oλ(l) and exact, see [SS15, Lemma 5.9, 5.11].

p |Oλ(l)(−)u) ∼= idOλ(l). Hence Indg

p |Oλ(l) is fully
(cid:3)

2.2. Indw and translation functors. For an integral weight ν denote by ν and
νI the unique weight in the W and WI -orbit (with respect to the regular action)
of ν with hν, αˇi ∈ Z≥0 for all α ∈ ∆ and hνI , αˇi ∈ Z≥0 for all α ∈ I .

Let λ and µ be some ∆-dominant or I-dominant weights and ν := µ − λ. Then

the corresponding translation functors are given by

Tµ
Tµ

λ : Oλ(l) → Oµ(l), M 7→ prµ(M ⊗ LI (νI )) and
λ : Oλ(g) → Oµ(g), M 7→ prµ(M ⊗ L(ν)),

where prµ denotes the projection to the corresponding block in O.

For w ∈ W I we deﬁne our main object of study:

Indw := Indg

p Tw·0

0

: O0(l) → O0(g).

So Indw maps MI (x.0) to M (xw.0). Remark 1 will justify this deﬁnition by showing
that the action of Indg
p on all regular integral blocks can be expressed in terms of
the Indw which have the advantage of involving the principal blocks only.

The goal of the rest of the section is to understand the interaction of translation
and wall-crossing functors and the Indw. We start oﬀ our investigation with two
technical lemmata.

Lemma 5. Let M be a l-module and E a ﬁnite dimensional g-module. Let ν1, . . . , νn
be the weights of z on E, ordered in a way that νi ≤ νj (i.e. hνj − νi, αˇi ≥ 0 for

all α ∈ ∆\I) implies i ≤ j. Then (cid:0)Indg

{0} = Nn+1 ⊂ Nn ⊂ · · · ⊂ N1 = (cid:0)Indg

p M(cid:1) ⊗ E has a ﬁltration
p M(cid:1) ⊗ E

with subquotients Ni/Ni+1 ∼= Indg

p (M ⊗ Eνi ).

GRADED PARABOLIC INDUCTION AND STRATIFIED MIXED TATE MOTIVES

5

Proof. The tensor identity yields

(cid:0)Indg

p M(cid:1) ⊗ E = (cid:0)U(g) ⊗U (p) M(cid:1) ⊗ E ∼= U(g) ⊗U (p) (M ⊗ E) .

Now set Mi := Pn

j=i M ⊗ Eνj ; this is clearly a l-submodule of M ⊗ E. Since
furthermore the weights νi are ordered in an ascending way, Mi is also a u and
hence a p-submodule. The Mi deﬁne a ﬁltration of M ⊗ E as a p-module with
subquotients Mi/Mi+1

∼= M ⊗ Eνi .

Let Ni := U(g) ⊗U (pI ) Mi. Using the exactness of parabolic induction and the
tensor identity we see that the Ni deﬁne a ﬁltration with the desired property. (cid:3)

Lemma 6. Let ν ∈ h∗ be some integral weight and ν′ := ν|z. Then, as l-module,
LI (νI ) appears with multiplicity one as direct summand of L(ν)ν ′ .

Proof. Let w ∈ W with ν = w(ν). Write w = xy with x a shortest left coset
representative of W/WI and y ∈ WI . Then one easily proofs y(ν) = νI and
xy(ν) = ν.

Now choose some non-zero v+ ∈ L(ν)y(ν). Then v+ is a highest weight vector

for l since for α ∈ Φ+
I

dimC L(ν)y(ν)+α = dimC L(ν)ν+x(α) = 0

because x(α) ∈ Φ+ and all weights of L(ν) are in ν−Z≥0Φ+. So indeed v+ generates
LI (νI ) as l-module and z acts on it via ν′ = ν|z = y(ν)|z. The multiplicity one
statement follows from dimC L(ν)y(ν) = 1.
(cid:3)

We can now analyse what translating from the principal block to another integral

(but not necessarily regular) block does to Indw.

Lemma 7. Let M ∈ O0(l) and µ some ∆-dominant integral weight. Then there
exists a natural isomorphism

0 Indw M ∼= Indg
Tµ

p Tw·µ

0 M.

Proof. First observe that the statement is true for Verma modules and the exactness
of all involved functors implies equality of characters of the left and right hand side
of the equation. The exactness furthermore allows us to assume that M has a
Verma ﬂag since it can be resolved by modules with a Verma ﬂag.

For abbreviation denote

N := Indw M ⊗ L(µ) = Indg

p Tw·0

0 M ⊗ L(µ).

By applying Lemma 5 to Indw M and L(µ) we see that, for suitable νi ∈ z∗, N has
a ﬁltration with subquotients of the form

Indg

p(cid:0)Tw·0

0 M ⊗ L(µ)νi(cid:1) .

We will show that prµ kills all subquotients of N except for the one with νi = w·µ|z.
For this shortly assume that M = MI(x · 0) for some x ∈ WI and let λ be a weight
of L(µ). Then the only subquotient in the Verma ﬂag of

N = Indw M ⊗ L(µ) = M (xw · 0) ⊗ L(µ)

contained in block Oµ(g) is of the form M (xw · 0 + λ) = M (xw · µ) by [Jan79, Satz
2.10] or [Hum08, Lemma 7.5 and Theorem 7.6]. To not be killed by prµ hence λ
has to be

λ = xw · µ − xw · 0 = xw(µ) and therefore

λ|z = (xw · µ − xw · 0)|z = xw(µ)|z = w(µ)|z.

Using the exactness of all involved functors we see that for general M with a Verma
ﬂag

prµ N = prµ(cid:0)Indg

p(cid:0)Tw·0

0 M ⊗ L(µ)w(µ)|z(cid:1)(cid:1) .

6

GRADED PARABOLIC INDUCTION AND STRATIFIED MIXED TATE MOTIVES

Lemma 6 now ensures that, as l-module, LI (w(µ)I ) appears as a direct summand
of L(µ)w(µ)|z . Hence

prµ N ⊃ prµ Indg

p(cid:16)Tw·0

0 M ⊗ LI(w(µ)I )(cid:17) .

By comparing characters we see that this is actually an equality, and that the right
hand side equals

Indg

p Tw·µ

w·0 Tw·0

0 M ∼= Indg

p Tw·µ

0 M.

The statement follows (the isomorphism is induced by the tensor identity and hence
indeed natural).
(cid:3)

As a ﬁrst application Lemma 7 can be used to express the eﬀect of Indg
regular integral blocks of O(l) in terms of the Indw and translation functors.

p on all

Remark 1. Each regular integral block of O(l) is of the form Ow·µ(l) for a ∆-
dominant µ and w ∈ W I . Restricted to Ow·µ(l) we have the following equivalence
of functors

where we use Tw·µ

0 T0

w·µ

Indg
p

∼= Indg

p Tw·µ

0 T0

w·µ
∼= Id and Lemma 7.

∼= Tµ

0 Indw T0

w·µ

Lemma 7 also serves as ﬁrst step in analysing the interaction of wall-crossing
I » which

functors with the Indw. At ﬁrst we study the case of «a wall outside of h∗
will be used as induction step in the proof of the main theorem.

Lemma 8. Let w ∈ W I and s ∈ W a simple reﬂection with ws > w and ws ∈ W I .
Denote by θs a wall-crossing functor through the s-wall. Namely choose some ∆-
dominant weight µ with stabilizer Wµ = {1, s} and put θs = T0
0 . Then for all
M ∈ O0(l) there is a short exact sequence, natural in M ,

µ Tµ

0
µ and Tµ
where the ﬁrst morphism is the unit of the adjunction between T0
0 .

θs Indw M

Indws M

Indw M

0

Proof. This works analogously to the proof of Lemma 7 by carefully analysing
T0
0 Indw M . The statement is again true for Verma modules and on the level of
characters and we can assume that M has a Verma ﬂag. For abbreviation denote

µ Tµ

0 Indw M ⊗ L(−µ).

N := Tµ
0 Indw M ∼= Indg

By applying Lemma 5 to Tµ
suitable νi ∈ z∗, N has a ﬁltration with subquotients of the form

p Tw·µ

0 M and L(−µ) we see that, for

Indg

p(cid:0)Tw·µ

0 M ⊗ L(−µ)νi(cid:1) .

We will show that pr0 kills all subquotients of N except for the ones with either

(a) νi = w(−µ)|z or
(b) νi = w(s · 0 − µ)|z.

For this shortly assume that M = MI(x · 0) for some x ∈ WI and let λ be a weight
of L(−µ). Then the only subquotients in the Verma ﬂag of

N = Tµ

0 Indw M ⊗ E(−µ) = M (xw · µ) ⊗ E(µ)

contained in O0(g) are by [Hum08, Theorem 7.14.] of the form

(a) M (xw · µ + λ) = M (xw · 0) or

(b) M (xw · µ + λ) = M (xws · 0).

GRADED PARABOLIC INDUCTION AND STRATIFIED MIXED TATE MOTIVES

7

Hence, to not be killed by pr0, λ has to be of the form

(a) λ = xw · 0 − xw · µ = xw(−µ) and therefore

λ|z = (xw · 0 − xw · µ)|z = xw(−µ)|z = w(−µ)|z or

(b) λ = xws · 0 − xw · µ = xw(s · 0 − µ) and therefore

λ|z = (xw · 0 − xws · µ)|z = xw(s · 0 − µ)|z = w(s · 0 − µ)|z.

Abbreviate νa := w(−µ)|z and νb := w(s · 0 − µ)|z (Notice: they are independent
of x). Then νa > νb since w(−µ) − w(s · 0 − µ) = w(αs) ∈ Φ+ \ Φ+
I which is easily
proven using the assumptions on w and s.

Now return to the case of a general M with Verma ﬂag. The above arguments

show that the only subquotients of N not entirely killed by pr0 are

(a) Na := Indg
(b) Nb := Indg

p(cid:0)Tw·µ
p(cid:0)Tw·µ

0 M ⊗ L(−µ)νa(cid:1) and
0 M ⊗ L(−µ)νb(cid:1)

and that Na appears below Nb as subquotients in the ﬁltration of N . Hence there

is a unique direct summand eN of N ﬁtting a short exact sequence

0

Na

eN

Nb

0

such that pr0(N ) = pr0( eN ). Therefore we now have to show pr0(Na) = Indw M

and pr0(Nb) = Indws M . We only do this in the case (b) with νb = w(s · 0 − µ)|z.
Use [Jan79, Satz 2.9] to see that w(s · 0 − µ) is a W-conjugate of −µ and hence
w(s · 0 − µ) = −µ. Apply Lemma 6 to w(s · 0 − µ) which implies that - as l-module
- LI (νbI ) appears as a direct summand of L(−µ)νb . Hence

prµ Nb ⊃ prµ Indg

p(cid:0)Tw·µ

0 M ⊗ LI (νbI )(cid:1) .

By comparing characters we see that this is actually an equality and that the right
hand side equals

Indg

p Tws·0

w·µ Tw·µ

0 M ∼= Indg

p Tws·0

0 M = Indws M.

The same proof works for Na and it is not hard to see that the embedding of Na

in eN can be choosen to be the unit of the adjunction. The statement follows. (cid:3)

Now we come to the second important case of crossing «a wall inside of h∗

I ».
This will be used for the base case concerning Inde of the induction proving the
main theorem.

Lemma 9. Let M ∈ O0(l) and µ ∈ h∗
I a I-dominant integral weight with WI,µ =
{1, s} for some simple reﬂection s ∈ WI . Denote by abuse of notation by θs =
T0
0 the wall-crossing functor for both O0(l) and O0(g). Then there is a natural
isomorphism

µ Tµ

θs Inde M ∼= Inde θsM.

Proof. Everything works the same as in the proof of Lemma 8 for w = e up to and
including the point where νa = w(−µ)|z = −µ|z and νb = w(s · 0 − µ)|z = s · 0 − µ|z
are deﬁned. But this time we do not have νa > νb but νa = νb = 0 since both µ
and s · 0 are in hI . Hence
µ Tµ

0 Inde M = pr0(Indg

0 M ⊗ L(−µ)0) .

p (Tµ

T0

Applying Lemma 6 to −µ shows that LI (−µI ) appears as a direct summand of
L(−µ)0 and again a character argument yields the statement.

3. Mixed Geometry

Let G ⊃ B ⊃ T the Langlands dual algebraic group, Borel subgroup and maximal
torus corresponding to g ⊃ b ⊃ h (we omit the (−)ˇ since we only consider the
Langlands dual). Denote by P ⊂ G the standard parabolic corresponding to p,
its unipotent radical by U and its Levi factor by L. Let A = B ∩ L be the Borel
subgroup of L. For α ∈ Φ denote by Uα ⊆ G the unipotent one-parameter subgroup
with Lie algebra gα.

(B)(X) and Derb,Z

Using the formalism of [CD09], [SW14] deﬁnes categories of stratiﬁed mixed Tate
motives (with respect to the Bruhat stratiﬁcation) on X := G/B and Y := L/A.
Denote them by Derb,Z
(A)(Y ), respectively. For a motive F let F (n)[m]
be its n-th Tate twist and m-th shift. Denote by w the weight structure on
Derb,Z
(A)(Y ), see [SW14, Section 5], and by the index w = 0 their
full subcategories of weight 0 complexes. For a brief description of the six-functor
formalism those categories are equipped with see [SW14, Remark 2.4]. Just think
about them as categories of constructible (with respect to the Bruhat stratiﬁcation)
sheaves with an additional Tate twist and a weight structure.

(B)(X) and Derb,Z

The goal of this section is to construct a geometric analogue of the functors Indw.

In Section 3.1 we start oﬀ by deﬁning for all w ∈ W I maps

Y

under which the Bruhat cell AxA/A in Y corresponds to the Bruhat cell BxwB/B
in X. We also analyse the functorial properties of the functors hw,∗p!
w. In Section

w are related to one another.

w. Denote by U and U −
3.1. Construction and functorial properties of hw,∗p!
the unipotent radical of B and B−, where by B− we denote the opposite Borel.
For x ∈ W deﬁne

Ux := U ∩ xU −x−1 = hUα|α ∈ x(Φ−) ∩ Φ+i ⊂ B.

Let w ∈ W I . Then the following statements hold.

∼= Al(w).
Lemma 10. 1.) As variety Uw
2.) As algebraic groups LUw ∼= L ⋉ Uw.
3.) As variety LUw/A ∼= L/A × Uw.
Proof. Omitted. See [Hum98, Chapter 28] (There Uw is denoted by U ′

w).

Deﬁne

hw : LUw/A → X, gA/A 7→ gwB/B and
pw : LUw/A ∼= Y × Uw → Y, (gB/B, u) 7→ gB/B.

Those maps fulﬁll the desired properties.

Lemma 11. The map hw is well-deﬁned and injective. Furthermore

hw(p−1

w (AxA/A)) = BwxB/B ⊂ X

for all x ∈ WI .

Proof. Follows from standard BN -pair arguments.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

This Lemma also ensures that hw,∗p!
w : Derb,Z

hw,∗p!

w really induces a functor

(A)(Y ) → Derb,Z

(B)(X),

i.e. maps mixed stratiﬁed Tate motives with respect to the Bruhat stratiﬁcation
as deﬁned in [SW14, Section 4] to such. Now we can come to the properties of the
hw,∗p!

w.

Lemma 12. 1.) Let x ∈ WI . Then hw,∗p!
w(DXI AxA/A) = DX BxwB/B, where
AxA/A and BxwB/B denote the constant motives on the Bruhat cells extended by
zero and D the Verdier duality functor.
2.) Let w = e, then hw,∗p!
functor

w = he,∗ is weight exact and restricts to a fully faithful

he,∗ : Derb,Z

(A)(Y )w=0 → Derb,Z

(B)(X)w=0.

Proof. 1.) Follows from Lemma 11.
2.) In this case he : Y ֒→ X is a proper embedding. Hence hx,∗ = hx,! is weight
left and right exact (see [SW14, Theorem 2.13, Remark 2.4]).

for s ∈ S. In this section we will hence study the interaction of the hw,∗p!
w and
π!
sπs,!.

We start with a statement similar to Lemma 8 which will serve as an argument

in the induction step of the proof of our main theorem.

Lemma 13. Let w ∈ W I , s ∈ S with ws > w and ws ∈ W I . Then for F ∈
Derb,Z

(A)(Y ) there exists a distinguished triangle

where the ﬁrst morphism is the unit of the adjunction.

Proof. Abbreviate π := πs. Consider the following diagram where the square is
cartesian and both triangles commute.

Here Z is deﬁned to be the pullback of the square. Since ws > w, πh is injective
we have

Z ∼= π−1(πhw(LUw/A)) = hws(LUws/A) ⊎ hw(LUw/A),

where hws(LUws/A) is open and hw(LUw/A) is closed in Z. The inclusions are
denoted by

Now we apply hw,∗ to the unit of the adjunction (π!, π!) and transform it.

Here we used base change for the upper right equality, iq = id and i! = i∗ as well
as π! = π∗ since both are proper. We claim that the lower morphism is induced
by the counit of the adjunction (i!, i!). By [SW14, Theorem 11.3.]
it suﬃces to
show this in the category of constructible sheaves, where it follows from an explicit

The following statement concerns in parallel to Lemma 9 the case of s ∈ SI and

will too be used in the base case of the induction.

Lemma 14. Let s ∈ SI and denote κs : Y → L/Qs for the minimal parabolic
Qs = A ∪ AsA. Then for F ∈ Derb,Z

(A)(Y ) there is a natural isomorphism

Now use πs,! ∼= πs,∗ and κs,! ∼= κs,∗ since both πs and κs are proper.

4. Soergel Modules and Proof

We need to introduce some notation mostly taken from [Soe90] and [SW14].
Let C and CI be the cohomology rings of X and Y . Denote by P and PI the
antidominant projectives in O0(g) and O0(l), respectively, and let

V = Homg(P, −) : O0(g) → C − Mod and

VI = Homl(PI , −) : O0(l) → CI − Mod

be the Kombinatorik functors. Denote by

H = ﬁn∗ Hom(X, −) : Derb,Z
HI = ﬁn∗ Hom(Y , −) : Derb,Z

(B)(X) → C − ModZ and
(A)(Y ) → CI − ModZ

the hypercohomology functors of X and Y . Here ﬁn denotes the projection to the
point and Hom the internal Hom-motive (see [SW14, Deﬁnition 8.2]). The cate-
gory of (evenly graded) Soergel modules denoted by SMod and SModZ
ev is deﬁned
as the essential image of all projectives and all weight zero complexes under the
Kombinatorik and hypercohomology functor.

As in the introduction let Res : CI − ModZ → C − ModZ be functor induced by
he : XI ֒→ X and the pullback map of cohomology. For s ∈ S there is a complex
of Soergel bimodules

Rs : · · ·

C

called the Rouquier complex. Here h−i denotes the degree shift in C −SModZ and C
sits in cohomological degree −1. The map is induced by the unit of the adjunction
coming from the Frobenius extension C s ⊂ C. The complex acts by tensoring on
the homotopy category of (evenly graded) Soergel modules. The goal of this section
is the proof of
Theorem 2. Let w ∈ W I and w = s1 · · · sn a reduced expression such that s1 · · · si ∈
W I for all i. Then on the homotopy category of (evenly graded) Soergel modules
both Indw and hw,∗p!

w induce (up to natural isomorphism) the same functor

Rsn ⊗C · · · ⊗C Rs1 ⊗C Res(−).

which ﬁnally amounts to our Theorem 1. The proof will work by in induction on
the length of w. We deal with the base case in Section 4.1 and the induction step
in Section 4.2.

4.1. The case w = e. The adjunction (h∗

e, he,∗) immediately yields

Lemma 15. There is an equivalence of functors

Hhe,∗

∼= Res HI : Derb,Z

(A)(Y )w=0 → C − SModZ

Lemma 16. Let s ∈ SI . Then we have an equivalence of functors

Proof. We have the following chain of equivalences of functors Derb,Z

HI ([Soe90, Korollar 2]).

Now use that HI induces an equivalence of categories.

(cid:3)

We want to analyse how Inde interacts with the functors VI and V.

Lemma 17. There is an equivalence of functors

V Inde ∼= Res VI : Proj O0(l) → C − SMod

Proof. One easily sees V Inde MI (0) = C = Res VI MI (0). Now Proj O0(l) is
the Karoubian envelope of its full additive subcategory of projectives of the form
θsn . . . θs1MI (0) where s1, . . . , sn ∈ SI and s1 · · · sn ∈ WI is a reduced expression.
For modules of this form we have

V Inde(θsn . . . θs1MI (0)) ∼= Vθsn . . . θs1 M (0) (Lemma 9)

∼= C ⊗C sn · · · ⊗C s1 C ([Soe90, Korollar 1])
∼= Res(CI ⊗C sn
∼= Res VI (θsn . . . θs1 MI(0)) ([Soe90, Korollar 1])

C) (Lemma 16)

· · · ⊗C

where all isomorphisms are natural. The statement follows for general projectives
by the properties of Karoubian envelopes.
(cid:3)

Since Inde maps projectives to projectives and he,∗ is weight exact, both act on
the homotopy category of projectives and weight 0 complexes by pointwise appli-
cation. Hence Lemma 15 and 17 imply Theorem 1 and 2 in the case w = e.

4.2. Induction Step. Assume that we already constructed the equivalence for a
ﬁxed w ∈ W I with reduced expression w = s1 · · · sn such that s1 · · · si ∈ W I for all
i. Denote Rw := Rsn ⊗C · · · ⊗C Rs1 . Now let s ∈ S with ws > w and ws ∈ W I .
Denote Rws := Rw ⊗C Rs.

In the following Lemmata we will need functorial mapping cones.

In general
this is not possible and is equivalent to the uniqueness of morphisms completing
a certain diagram of distinguished triangles, c.f.
[GM03, IV.7. A Cone]. The
following Lemma gives a suﬃcient condition for this uniqueness.

Lemma 18. Let C be a triangulated category. Then for any commutative diagram
of distinguished triangles of the form

X

X ′

Y

Y ′

+1

+1

Z

f

Z ′

there is a f ∈ HomC(Z, Z ′) completing the diagram to a morphism of triangles. If
HomC(X[1], Z ′) = 0 then f is unique.

Proof. For example [GM03, IV.1 Corollary 5].

(cid:3)

Lemma 19. The following diagram commutes (up to a natural transformation).

Hotb(CI − SMod)

Rws⊗C Res(−)

Hotb(C − SMod)

≀ VI

Hotb(Proj Oo(l))

≀

Derb(O0(l))

Indws

≀ V

Hotb(Proj Oo(g))

≀

Derb(O0(g))

Proof. Let M ∈ Derb(O0(l)) and denote by ∆ the equivalence between the derived
category and the homotopy category of projectives. Then by applying V∆ to the
distinguished triangle induced by Lemma 8 we obtain a distinguished triangle in
Hotb(C − SMod)

V∆ Indw M

V∆θs Indw M

V∆ Indws M +1

Using the induction hypothesis, the fact that θs maps projectives to projectives and
[Soe90, Korollar 1] this is isomorphic to

Rw ⊗C Res VI ∆M

C ⊗C s Rw ⊗C Res VI ∆M

V∆ Indws M +1

and it follows that V∆ Indws M is isomorphic to the mapping cone of the ﬁrst
morphism which is precisely Rws ⊗C Res(VI ∆M ). Here we use that the morphism
Indw M → θs Indw M is induced by the adjunction morphism 1 → θs.

This indeed yields a natural

isomorphism between the mapping cone and
V∆ Indws M since it is unique: By Lemma 18 it suﬃces to show that for all
M, N ∈ Derb(O0(l)) we have

HomDerb(O0(l))(Indw M, Indws N ) = 0.

This is true since both Indw M and Indws N are quasi-isomorphic to a complexes
of modules with Verma ﬂags consisting of M (xw · 0) and M (xws · 0), respectively,
for x ∈ WI . Now use that Extn(M (xw · 0), M (yws · 0)) = 0 for all n and x, y ∈ WI ,
see [Hum08, Theorem 6.11].
