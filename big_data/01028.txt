Abstract: We derive the medium-induced, coherent gluon radiation spectrum associated
with the hard forward scattering of an energetic parton oﬀ a nucleus, in the saturation
formalism and within the Gaussian approximation for the relevant correlators of Wilson
lines. The calculation reproduces the simple expression for the spectrum previously ob-
tained in the opacity expansion formalism, and rigorously speciﬁes its validity range. The
connection between the calculations in the opacity expansion and saturation formalisms is
made apparent. This study may serve as a ﬁrst step in order to implement consistently
induced coherent energy loss and gluon shadowing in ‘saturation-based models’ of hadron
nuclear suppression in proton-nucleus collisions.

Introduction

At collider (RHIC, LHC) energies and at large enough rapidity, the observed suppression
of hadron production rates in proton-nucleus (p–A) with respect to proton-proton (p–
p) collisions, is often attributed to gluon ‘shadowing’, i.e. to the depletion of the gluon
density in the nucleus (with respect to a proton) expected at small x2 . 10−2. Shadowing
is currently either incorporated in nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) obtained
from ﬁts based on DGLAP evolution within collinear factorization, or determined from
non-linear QCD evolution within the saturation formalism (see [1, 2] for topical reviews).
In addition to shadowing, another eﬀect can also suppress hadron production rates,
namely medium-induced coherent radiation in cold nuclear matter [3–10]. As a matter of
fact, in quarkonium production the eﬀect of coherent energy loss was shown [4, 6] to provide
a good description of ﬁxed-target [11] and RHIC [12, 13] J/ψ nuclear suppression data,
as well as successful predictions for the J/ψ suppression later observed in p–Pb collisions

– 1 –

at the LHC [14, 15]. Moreover, when extrapolated to nucleus-nucleus (A–A) collisions,
coherent energy loss in cold nuclear matter proves to be a sizable eﬀect [16], which is
therefore crucial to study in more detail before disentangling the additional ‘hot’ eﬀects
associated with the production of a quark-gluon plasma in A–A collisions.

Shadowing and coherent energy loss are two diﬀerent eﬀects, and should in principle
be both taken into account in nuclear suppression models. However, recent models for
quarkonium nuclear suppression either focus on shadowing eﬀects (in the collinear factor-
ization approach [17–19] or in the saturation formalism [20–22]) and neglect energy loss, or
consider coherent energy loss as the leading eﬀect to which shadowing is added by assum-
ing that the two eﬀects factorize [4, 6]. In order to better quantify the respective roles of
shadowing and energy loss in quarkonium (and more generally hadron) nuclear suppression
in p–A collisions at collider energies,1 a phenomenological approach may consist in looking
for speciﬁc observables sensitive to energy loss, but having a reduced uncertainty on the
precise magnitude of shadowing. For instance, the ratio of p–A nuclear suppression factors
in J/ψ w.r.t. Drell-Yan production could be such an observable [23]. On the theoretical
side, a ﬁrst principle calculation incorporating consistently the physics of both shadowing
and coherent energy loss would be desirable but is still missing.

⊥ ∼ Q2

The saturation formalism should be an appropriate framework to achieve this goal.
However, to our knowledge only one study addressed the theoretical calculation of induced
coherent radiation in this formalism (Ref. [9], see below), and as mentioned above, coherent
energy loss has not yet been incorporated in phenomenological studies of hadron nuclear
suppression based on saturation. Roughly speaking, current saturation models account for
the eﬀects arising directly from multiple soft scatterings in the nucleus, which include small-
x shadowing, but also the eﬀect of nuclear transverse momentum broadening (the ‘Cronin
s, where Qs ≡ Qg is the gluon saturation scale in the nucleus.2 Medium-
eﬀect’), ∆p2
induced coherent energy loss may naively be viewed as ‘next-to-leading’ (since it is formally
∼ O (αs) as compared e.g. to the Cronin eﬀect), but could however be a crucial eﬀect in
hadron nuclear suppression (as suggested by J/ψ suppression in p–A collisions); its speciﬁc
parametric dependence indeed leads to an average induced energy loss proportional to the
energy of the fast radiating parton, hence its expected relevance in forward processes [3].
Medium-induced coherent radiation has previously been studied theoretically by seve-
ral groups, using diﬀerent formalisms and considering diﬀerent particular cases. Ref. [3]
(see also [4]) studied the induced coherent radiation associated with the hard forward
g → Q ¯Q process (mediated by a single hard gluon exchange in the t-channel), the ﬁnal
Q ¯Q pair being a massive pointlike color octet, in a Feynman diagram calculation and at
ﬁrst order in the opacity expansion formalism [24]. Induced coherent radiation was also
studied using a semi-classical method in Refs. [5, 7], at ﬁrst order [5] and all orders [7] in
opacity and in a similar kinematical setup as that of Ref. [3], however for the q → q case
1At ﬁxed-target energies (√s . 40 GeV) the situation for J/ψ nuclear suppression seems relatively clear:
shadowing is expected to be small at those energies, and coherent energy loss is likely to be the dominant
eﬀect, at least at large enough xF [4, 6].

2Throughout this paper we denote the ‘saturation scale’ of a parton a = q, g in the nucleus and in the

proton as Qa and Qap, respectively, and deﬁne the generic saturation scale in the nucleus as Qs ≡ Qg.

of a massless quark experiencing a hard scattering mediated by a color singlet exchange
in the t-channel. In Ref. [8], induced coherent radiation was revisited and derived to all
orders in the opacity expansion, for any 1 → 1 hard forward process. A general expression
for the induced coherent spectrum (encompassing the particular cases studied before) was
found, as well as a simple rule for the overall color factor of the induced spectrum. The
latter reads CR +CR′ −Ct, with CR, CR′ and Ct the incoming, outgoing and t-channel color
charges of the 1 → 1 hard partonic process [8]. Induced coherent radiation associated with
1 → 2 forward processes was also addressed (in the leading-logarithm and large-Nc limits),
for g → q ¯q and q → qg in the saturation formalism [9] and for q → qg and g → gg using the
opacity expansion [10]. In the leading-logarithm approximation, the soft induced coherent
radiation does not probe the size of the ﬁnal two-parton system, and thus only depends
on its total color charge. Hence the conjecture, proposed and explicitly checked for q → qg
and g → gg in Ref. [10], that the spectrum associated with 1 → n hard forward processes
is given by an incoherent sum of spectra associated with 1 → 1 processes, weighted by
the probabilities PR′ for the n-parton state to be produced in color representation R′ in
the hard process. This conjecture is expected to hold for any ﬁnite Nc (but only in the
leading-logarithm approximation) [10].

In view of implementing coherent energy loss in saturation-based phenomenological
models, it is helpful to ﬁrst show how the induced coherent spectrum associated with
1 → 1 hard forward processes, previously derived in Ref. [8] using the opacity expansion,
arises in the saturation formalism. This is the goal of the present study, which may also
serve as a ﬁrst step in order to explore, in the saturation formalism, the above-mentioned
conjecture. We restrict ourselves to 1 → 1 processes where the type a of the energetic
parton is conserved, namely a → a, with a = q (massless quark) or a = g (gluon).3 As
in Ref. [8] we work at ﬁnite Nc and at ‘leading order’ in αs, i.e. we consider the radiation
of a single gluon. Our ﬁnal result (3.8) for the induced coherent spectrum associated with
a → a coincides with the result of Ref. [8], in particular the color factor 2CR −CA obeys the
general rule CR + CR′ − Ct (a → a being mediated by a t-channel color octet hard exchange,
Ct = CA). In the quark case we have 2CF − CA = −1/Nc, and the (induced) radiation
spectrum associated with q → q is thus negative. This somewhat surprising result (which
however has a simple interpretation [8]) is conﬁrmed here within the saturation formalism.
Finally, in the present study we also evaluate the magnitude of expected corrections
to the spectrum (3.8), allowing one to specify its validity range, which question was not
addressed in Ref. [8]. We ﬁnd that (3.8) holds up to values of z (the energy fraction carried
by the radiated gluon w.r.t. to the parton a) where (3.8) is much smaller than its leading
logarithmic behavior ∼ log (1/z) valid at small z, but still larger in order of magnitude than
the expected corrections. Thus, (3.8) predicts the ‘large’-z tail of the spectrum, which is
important for phenomenology.

Our paper is organized as follows.

3From this point of view, the present calculation is less general than in Ref. [8], where hard processes
with a change of the energetic parton type, q → g and g → q, were also considered. Such processes could
certainly be studied within the saturation formalism, but this would require implementing in this formalism
hard scatterings with color triplet exchange in the t-channel.

– 3 –

In section 2, we formulate our observable in coordinate space and arrive at the general
expression of the induced coherent radiation spectrum, see Eqs. (2.16)-(2.19). Within the
Gaussian approximation for the ﬁeld of the nucleus, we extract in section 3 the leading
asymptotics of the coherent spectrum, given by (3.8). For simplicity, the calculation of
section 3 is somewhat formal, but all details of the fully rigorous calculation are given in
appendix B. In section 4 we repeat the derivation of (3.8) in a simpliﬁed and transparent
way, allowing one to connect our calculation performed in the saturation formalism to the
opacity expansion of Ref. [8]. Finally, in section 5 we discuss heuristically how small-x
evolution could be implemented in the calculation of induced coherent energy loss.

2 Medium-induced soft radiation in hard forward parton scattering

2.1 Deﬁnition of observable

We consider an energetic massless parton a = q, g (massless quark or gluon) from a projec-
tile proton that scatters oﬀ a target nucleus A, and later hadronizes in the forward region
of the proton-nucleus (p–A) collision, a(P0) + A → a(P ) + X.4 We consider the limit of
forward scattering, where p+ is arbitrarily large but transverse momenta are limited, and
focus on hard scattering, where the ﬁnal parton transverse momentum p ≡ |p| is much
larger than the gluon saturation scale Qs in the nucleus,

p ≫ Qs .

(2.1)

We aim to derive the medium-induced, soft gluon radiation spectrum associated with
such a scattering of parton a. This amounts to producing an additional gluon in the ﬁnal
state, a(P0) + A → a(P ) + g(P ′) + X, and considering the limit

z ≡

≪ 1 .

The soft radiation energy spectrum is then deﬁned as

where y = ln (p+/p) is the parton rapidity, and dσ(p + A → . . .) is obtained by convoluting

nucleus to be moving in the + and − directions, respectively. The forward region is deﬁned as the proton
fragmentation region, i.e. the region of positive rapidities in the center-of-mass frame of an elementary
proton-nucleon collision, corresponding to large rapidities in the nucleus rest frame. We will set p0 = 0 and
denote p ≡ |p|.

2.2 Uniﬁed formulae for a → a + g forward production

The forward production cross section dσ(pA → ag +X) appearing in the numerator of (2.3)
has been considered before by various authors. We start by quoting the double diﬀerential
cross section derived in the case a = q [25] and a = g [26] for an arbitrary fraction z of the
ﬁnal gluon energy.5 The cross section is given by the same formal expression in the two
cases and reads

The four terms in the bracket of (2.5) arise from the four diagrams contributing to
the squared amplitude of the partonic process a(P0) + A → a(P ) + g(P ′) + X and are
represented in Fig. 1: diagram 1a where the gluon is radiated before the interaction with
the nucleus in both the amplitude and its conjugate (initial state radiation); diagram 1b
where the splitting a → ag happens after the interaction in both the amplitude and its
conjugate (ﬁnal state radiation); diagrams 1c and 1d corresponding to interference terms.
The coordinates of the outgoing parton a and gluon are, respectively, b and x in the
amplitude, and b′ and x′ in the conjugate amplitude. The coordinate of the incoming
parton a is v = zx + (1 − z)b in the amplitude, and v′ = zx′ + (1 − z)b′ in its conjugate.
Finally, S(i) are correlators of Wilson lines which sum up the multiple scattering inter-
actions of the parton and gluon with the target. The correlators relevant to the diagrams
of Figs. 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d read, respectively [25, 26]

in a number of two-gluon exchanges between the (a, g) system and a subset of nucleons in
the nucleus. We represented a particular event where a ﬁrst nucleon interacts elastically in
the amplitude and does not interact in the conjugate amplitude, and a second nucleon that
interacts inelastically. The parton a can radiate the gluon from the initial state (diagram

We stress that in general, the correlators (2.7)-(2.10) depend on the collision energy
of the parton-nucleus scattering, through the average over the nucleus ﬁeld conﬁgurations.
However, within the Gaussian approximation for the nucleus ﬁeld which we use in the

present study, this energy dependence is absent: all correlators of Wilson lines can be
expressed in terms of (energy-independent) two-point correlators of the form given by the
McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model [28], see appendix A. How to implement the energy
dependence (or small-x evolution) will be brieﬂy discussed in section 5.

Since the observable under study deﬁned in (2.3) and (2.4) is inclusive in the gluon

transverse momentum p′, we readily integrate (2.5) over p′, which sets x′ = x and gives

a [b, b′]
(which directly follows from (2.7)), and the fact that the factor in front of the bracket in
the integrand of (2.13) is symmetric under b ↔ b′ (given that the cross section is obviously
an even function of the vector p).

a [b, x, b′, x] = S(2)

Finally, let us emphasize that the cross section (2.13) to produce an additional gluon
obviously vanishes in the absence of interaction with the nucleus, i.e., in the formal limit
S(i) → 1. Thus, (2.13) could be equivalently expressed in terms of T -matrix elements
(T = S − 1) by formally replacing S → T .

2.3 Parton elastic scattering cross section

We will now express the denominator of (2.3) corresponding to parton elastic scattering,
which amplitude squared is shown in Fig. 2. In the quark case, the cross section for elastic
scattering oﬀ a nucleus has been calculated in the saturation formalism in Ref. [29]. In the
notations of the previous section,8 the quark-nucleus scattering cross section (convoluted
with the quark distribution in the proton) is given by

leaving only the 2-point correlator ∝ hTr(UF (b)U †

treated in the same way, leading to the cross section for the elastic scattering of parton a,

The diﬀerential cross section for parton elastic scattering at large p is related to the Fourier

In the large p limit (2.1), the size of the dipole r = b′ − b in (2.15) is small, |r| . 1/p ≪
1/Qs < 1/ΛQCD , and thus much smaller than any nuclear size RA, including that of the
proton Rp ∼ 1/ΛQCD. The above approximation of inﬁnite transverse nuclear size is thus
QCD/p2).

2.4 Master equation

The induced soft radiation spectrum (2.3) is obtained by taking the z ≪ 1 limit of (2.13),
dividing by (2.15) and applying the medium-induced prescription (2.4).

a [b, b′] is a function of b′ − b only, S(2)

Within the approximation of an inﬁnite transverse nuclear size (valid at large p), the
two-point correlator S(2)
a [b, b′] ≡ Sa(b′ − b), where
Sa(x) is given in appendix A, see (A.1). Similarly, the three-point correlator S(3)
a [b, x, v′]
depends only on relative transverse positions, as shown by its explicit expression (A.9) (or
equivalently (A.10)). Changing variable x → x + b′ followed by b′ → b + r in (2.13), and

The expression (2.16) is the induced, soft (z ≪ 1) radiation spectrum associated with the
hard (p ≫ Qs) scattering of a parton a = q, g, as predicted in the saturation formalism.
It is valid in the forward limit (p+ → ∞ at ﬁxed p ≡ |p|), up to ﬁnite size corrections of
relative order ∼ O(Λ2

The two terms in the bracket of (2.16) are, respectively, the combined contribution
from initial state and ﬁnal state radiation (when z ≪ 1 these contributions are identical),
and the contribution from the interference. It will prove useful in the following section to

3 Explicit derivation of the induced soft radiation spectrum

Here we present a brief derivation of (2.18) and (2.19) in the hard scattering limit (2.1).
The calculation of sections 3.1 and 3.2 is somewhat formal, but allows one to rapidly reach
the result, which is conﬁrmed by a more rigorous calculation presented in appendix B,
where the order of magnitude of correction terms is also determined. The ﬁnal result for
the spectrum is summed up in section 3.3, see (3.8).

3.1 Contribution from initial/ﬁnal state radiation

In the hard scattering limit (2.1), the contribution (2.18) from purely initial (ﬁnal) state
radiation can be evaluated as follows. (We recall the notation p = |p|, r = |r|, etc.)

The r-integral in the numerator of (2.18) is dominated by r . 1/p ≪ 1/Qa (where Qa
is the parton saturation scale in the nucleus, see footnote 2), and we can thus approximate
Sa(r) − 1 ∝ Q2
Since the denominator of (2.18) is also ∝ Q2
a (with the same accuracy, see (A.25)), the Qa-
dependence cancels in the ratio, leaving no contribution in the induced spectrum deﬁned

by (2.4), up to terms ∼ O(cid:0)Q2

The latter derivation is somewhat formal because (2.18) is actually ill-deﬁned, the x-
integral in the numerator being logarithmically divergent at large x. A rigorous calculation,
obtained by ﬁrst regularizing this infrared divergence, and presented in appendix B.1,
conﬁrms that the contribution to the induced spectrum from purely initial (ﬁnal) state
radiation is power-suppressed at large p, and allows one to estimate more accurately the
magnitude of this contribution, namely (see (B.7)),

At large p the contribution (3.2) is dominated by r . 1/p ≪ 1/Qa. When x is of the
same order, x ∼ r . 1/p, all dipole scattering factors appearing in (3.2) can be expanded at

Approximating the integrand of (3.2) in the latter domain we get

This is because when r . 1/p ≪ 1/Qa, the small-r expansion of Sa(r) (obtained by expanding (A.8)) is
non-analytic in r, Sa(r) − 1 ∝ Q2
a r2 log(µr). This crucial feature would be lost if performing the small-r
expansion at the level of Eq. (3.4).

Similarly to the previous section, the derivation presented here is quite formal (in par-
ticular, the contribution ∝ δ(2)(p) neglected in (3.4) is actually multiplied by the divergent

sented in appendix B.2 (see (B.18)), up to terms which do not exceed the magnitude of
the contribution from purely initial state radiation given by (3.1).

3.3 Sum up

In summary, in the kinematical limit deﬁned by (2.1) and (2.2), the induced coherent spec-
trum is dominantly given by the interference contribution (3.7). For the sake of simplicity,
let us write the induced coherent spectrum associated with the scattering of parton a oﬀ
nucleus A with respect to a ﬁctitious target obtained by setting Qgp = 0 in (3.7),12

The x-integral in (3.8), which is a function of the three dimensionful parameters µ,
Qg ≡ Qs, and zp, was studied in Ref. [8].13 Here we only quote the parametric limits of
(3.8) at ﬁxed Q2

turns out to be numerically relevant, since it gives a more accurate small-z approximation
to the exact expression (3.8) even for realistic values of the parameters [8].

We stress that the order of corrections to the result (3.8) was not estimated in Ref. [8].
As mentioned in the previous sections and shown in appendix B, those corrections have a
(maximal) magnitude given in (3.1), and are thus power-suppressed at large p. Therefore,

12The spectrum (3.7) relevant to p–A collisions is then simply given by the diﬀerence of the spectrum

(3.8) between a nucleus and a proton target.

13In Ref. [8], the independent parameters were chosen to be zp, µ, and the dimensionless parameter
s/(2µ2) appearing in the expression of Sg(x) (see (A.6)), where L is the path-length of the

not satisﬁed (but still p ≫ Qs), the validity of the spectrum (3.8) is limited to its small-z
logarithmic behavior (3.9). Indeed, at small enough z the latter always dominates over
correction terms such as (3.1), which remain bounded at small z.

4 Comparing the opacity expansion and saturation formalisms

Let us emphasize that the calculation of the induced coherent spectrum (3.8) may look
quite diﬀerent in the saturation formalism (used in the present study) and in the opacity
expansion (used in Ref. [8]). In the saturation formalism, the calculation is performed in
coordinate space and scatterings are resummed (‘exponentiated’) from the start in the two-
point and three-point correlators entering (2.16). In contrast, the calculation of Ref. [8]
is done in momentum space, for a single hard scattering and n soft rescatterings. The
calculation at ﬁrst order in opacity (n = 1) is generalized to any order n by making use of
recurrency relations. Summing over n then leads to the usual exponentiation (producing the
term Sg(x) in (3.8)), which exponentiation thus appears at a later stage of the calculation
when compared to the saturation formalism.

In order to make the equivalence between formalisms more transparent, we show below
how the coherent spectrum derived in [8] is linked to the expression (2.16) in the saturation
formalism. Since we have shown in section 3 that the induced spectrum arises dominantly
from the interference term, we may start from (2.19), and insert the expressions (A.1) and
(A.9) of the correlators. As shown in section 3.2, at large p the two-point correlator in the
denominator of (2.19) can be formally expanded to ﬁrst order in the function ˆΓ (deﬁned in
(A.5)). Expanding then the numerator of (2.19) in ˆΓ, the linear term gives no contribution
to the induced spectrum (for the reason mentioned in section 3.2, see the discussion after
(3.3)), so that we keep only terms of power m ≥ 2 in ˆΓ, corresponding to the contribution
of m scatterings (associated with the symmetry factor 1/m!). We thus rewrite (2.19) as
(note that the ‘induced prescription’ with respect to a ﬁctitious target having Qs = 0 is
now irrelevant)

When expanding the bracket of (4.2), the term ∝ ˆΓ(x)m formally contributes to δ(2)(p)

∝ m ˆΓ(x)m−1 ˆΓ(r), which has a simple physical interpretation. The factor ˆΓ(r) singles out

k(cid:1) ˆΓ(x)m−k ˆΓ(r)k (for 1 ≤ k ≤ m)
which can be dropped at large p, and the terms ∝ (cid:0)m
scale as O(cid:0)( ¯Q2/p2)k(cid:1) (recall that r ∼ 1/p). Thus, the dominant term is given by the term
the hard scattering (with the factor (cid:0)m

expansion used in Ref. [8]. We also remark that the hard scattering factor Rr eip·r ˆΓ(r)

elastic cross sections (see also our comments after (A.25)), leading to

Finally, we stress that it is the chosen kinematical limit (2.1) which leads to the domi-
nance of a single hard exchange (in both the radiative and elastic cross sections), the other
scatterings being soft, independently of the formalism used. The probability to have more

than one hard scattering is suppressed by O(cid:0)Q2

s/p2(cid:1) (at least), which speciﬁes the order

of magnitude of the correction terms to the spectrum (3.8), as shown in section 3 and
appendix B.

5 Outlook: implementing small-x evolution

In this paper, we treated the scattering of the quarks and gluons oﬀ the target nucleus in
the approximation where the exchanged gluons couple eikonally to the incoming partons.
Technically, these exchanges are encoded in products of Wilson lines averaged over the
ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld of the nucleus, see Eqs. (2.7)-(2.10). To arrive at explicit formulae,
we used the Gaussian approximation for the ﬁeld of the target, allowing one to express
all correlators of Wilson lines with the help of two-point correlators having the simple
McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) form [28], see appendix A. As is well-known, those correlators
g = CA ¯Q2 in our convention, see (A.4)),
depend on a saturation scale Qs (with Q2
which in the MV model is independent of the parton-nucleus collision energy.

s = Q2

In principle, the dependence on the collision energy (or energy evolution), could be
readily implemented for a process such as medium-induced gluon radiation. In the nucleus
rest frame and at high collision energy, the incoming parton radiates not only one but many
soft gluons. One may attribute the induced energy loss to the hardest gluon, and factorize
the softer gluons (associated with shorter lifetimes) into the nuclear parton density, which
then captures the energy evolution (also named small-x evolution). How this comes about
technically was shown in detail in the case of the broadening process (in the large-Nc limit)
in Ref. [31], where it was argued that the same should occur for similar semi-inclusive
processes at leading and next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.

Let us describe how small-x evolution could be implemented for the induced energy
loss process. To this aim, imagine we start with a scattering at small rapidity.
In this
low-energy regime, it is legitimate to represent the ﬁeld of the nucleus by a Gaussian ﬁeld,
as in the MV model. Increasing the collision energy by boosting the nucleus leads to a
modiﬁcation of the nucleus ﬁeld driven by the B-JIMWLK equation. Hence the correlators
appearing in the equations should be taken, at high energy, as solutions of the B-JIMWLK
equations. Note that they must be evaluated numerically since no analytical solution to
the latter equations is known. It is possible to simplify the formalism by going to the large-
Nc limit, where all correlators reduce to (sums of products of) two-point functions being
solutions of the simpler Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, which however still needs numerical
evaluation. Moreover, let us stress that in the large-Nc limit, the induced coherent energy
loss (3.8) (derived in the Gaussian approximation) would vanish in the quark case (since
2CF − CA = −1/Nc → 0 when Nc → ∞). Thus, the large-Nc limit is too drastic to address
interesting eﬀects such as a negative induced radiation spectrum associated with the q → q
process, as found in [8] and conﬁrmed by the present study.

In order to address the eﬀect of small-x evolution on induced energy loss (without
relying on the large-Nc limit), one may still assume a Gaussian approximation for the
solution of the evolution itself, which was shown [32] to be practically a good approximation.
Then, it is enough to use the MV form for the two-point functions, but with a saturation
scale now promoted to an x-dependent function.

The value of x that should be used for the evolution of the B-JIMWLK correlators (or
as an argument of the saturation scale in the case of the Gaussian approximation) is the
Bjorken-x associated to a gluon of energy p′+ and typical size x (namely the transverse

– 14 –

size vector appearing in the integration (3.8)) scattering oﬀ a proton (of mass mp) of the
nucleus, namely xB = 1/(2mp x2 p′+) [9].

In summary, we expect the radiation responsible for QCD small-x evolution to be
derived independently of the harder (though still soft compared to the radiating parton)
induced coherent radiation studied in the present paper. However, how this works in
practice remains to be studied. In particular, it is not known for sure to which extent the
modiﬁcation of the induced spectrum arising from small-x evolution would be correctly
captured by replacing the saturation scale Qs appearing in (3.8) by an x-dependent scale
Qs(x). Based on previous studies of other observables, we may expect the latter recipe
to be valid at least in the small-z region, where the parametric behaviour (3.9) of the
spectrum is logarithmic. Numerical studies using an implementation of the B-JIMWLK
equation (see e.g. Ref. [33]) could also help answering such questions.

A Two-point and three-point correlators

In this appendix we consider the generic case of a parton a of color charge CR (with in
practice a = q, CR = CF or a = g, CR = CA), and give explicit expressions of the S-matrix
elements for the scattering of an a¯a dipole and of a color-neutral ag¯a system oﬀ the nucleus.
Throughout this appendix, we assume that the color sources in the nucleus have Gaussian
correlations, which should be valid for asymptotically large nuclei (namely A ≫ 1). We
also assume a uniform distribution of the nuclear matter in the transverse plane.

In section A.1 we quote the coordinate-space expressions of the two-point and three-
point correlators known from previous studies, which also ﬁxes our notations and conven-
tions. In section A.2 we derive the Fourier transform of the two-point correlator in the
large-momentum limit.

A.1 Coordinate-space expressions

two-point correlator

Let us start with the a¯a dipole scattering S-matrix deﬁned in (2.8), namely (the normalized
trace of) the correlator of two Wilson lines separated by the transverse distance x. In the
framework of the Gaussian approximation for the ﬁeld of the nucleus, it takes the well-
known McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) form [28]. Following appendix A.5.1 of Ref. [35] we

(A.4)

The function (A.2) has a logarithmic infrared divergence, but as is well-known, this
divergence is eﬀectively screened by color neutrality at distance scales larger than the
nucleon size ∼ Λ−1
QCD (see for instance the discussion in appendix A of Ref. [30]). We choose
to regularize the divergence by introducing a ‘gluon mass’ µ ∼ ΛQCD, namely by replacing
ℓ2 → ℓ2 + µ2, in the denominator of the propagator appearing in (A.2). The latter thus
becomes

the three-point correlator S(3)
a [b, x, v′] deﬁned in (2.9) (where b, v′ and x are the transverse
coordinates of a, ¯a and the gluon, respectively) may be expressed with the help of the
function ˆΓ. The relevant relations can be found in Ref. [36] (see also Ref. [37], and Ref. [35]
for the particular qg ¯q case). We may cast the results as (with a = q, g)

where Sa(r) is given by (A.6). Note that the integral in (A.11) is perfectly convergent and
well-deﬁned.

When p is large, we expect that only small values of r, namely r . 1/p ≪ 1/µ,
contribute to the integral. In order to compute the large-p asymptotics, we may try and
expand Sa(r) given by (A.8) as a power series16

The n = 0 term in the expression (A.12) gives a contribution ∝ δ(2)(p), which can be
dropped at ﬁnite p. The other terms can be evaluated as follows. In (A.13) we use the
representation

logn(µr) =

(A.14)

integrate over the angle between p and r, and perform the change of variable u = pr in
the remaining integral over r, to obtain

Hn =

du u1+δ J0(u) .

(A.15)

The integral over u can be calculated for values of δ for which it is convergent, and then
analytically continued in the vicinity of δ = 0. We arrive at

(A.16)

15The expression (A.10) of the three-point correlator in terms to the dipole S-matrix element (A.1) simply
arises from the fact that the color factors in (A.9) can always be put in the exponent of an exponential
factor, but this is only formal and (A.10) has no special physical interpretation. In particular, we stress that
in the quark case (a = q), the third term in the exponential of (A.9) is positive (since 2CF − CA = −1/Nc),
and therefore the third factor in the r.h.s. of (A.10) cannot be a true S-matrix element.
16The series (A.12) depends on the integrals Hn, which are actually ill-deﬁned. A mathematically rigo-
rous procedure could consist, for instance, in introducing an exponential cutoﬀ of the form e−εr in the
integral in (A.11) before expanding. Then all terms in the expansion would be well-deﬁned. However, such
complications can be avoided by using analyticity arguments such as the ones used in our derivation of Hn
below.

Here we evaluate the contribution (2.18) of purely initial (ﬁnal) state radiation to the

x2(x+r)2 is divergent and needs to be re-

gularized. First, we note that using the identity

the x-integral can be formally rewritten as a k-integral,

The second equality above follows from the fact that the integral of each term in the ﬁrst

Here we present a more rigorous derivation of the interference contribution (3.2) than that
presented in section 3.2.

First, we perform the change of variable r → r − zx (suggested by the discussion of

section 3.2) in the numerator of (3.2) to obtain (within the limit z ≪ 1)
