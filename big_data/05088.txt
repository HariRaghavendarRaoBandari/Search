DENSITY STABILITY FOR SOME L´EVY-DRIVEN STOCHASTIC

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS.

L. Huang 1

Abstract. We consider a Stochastic Diﬀerential Equation driven by a L´evy process whose L´evy
measure satisfy a tempered stable domination. We study how a perturbation of the coeﬃcients reﬂects
on the density of the solution. We quantify the distance between the densities in term of the proximity
of the coeﬃcients. This extend to the stable case the works of [KKM15], where the noise is Gaussian.

1. Introduction and Main Result

This work is motivated by the recent article of Konakov et al. [KKM15], where the authors studied the
sensitivity of the density of a diﬀusion process with respect to a perturbation on the coeﬃcients. In this paper,
we aim to extend their result, formulated for the Brownian motion to other types of noises. Speciﬁcally to the
class of L´evy processes whose L´evy measure satisfy the domination [H-1] below. For such L´evy process Z, we
consider the following SDE:

We are interested in a perturbation of this equation:

dXt = b(t, Xt)dt + σ(t, Xt− )dZt.

dX n

t−)dZt.

t = bn(t, X n

t )dt + σn(t, X n

(1.1)

(1.2)

We assume that the coeﬃcients b and σ can be obtained as a limit: bn → b and σn → σ, and we aim to control
the distance between the densities of Xt and X n
t . Quantifying such a distance can be useful for applicative
purposes. See [KKM15] for a review of the literature.

The idea is to exploit the parametrix series to obtain explicit representations for the densities. The expansions
can in turn be linked to the coeﬃcients of the SDE. This allows us to control the distance between the densities
using the distance between the coeﬃcients. Let us mention that the parametrix representation proves to be
very useful when tracking the dependency of the density in some parameter of the coeﬃcients. For instance,
we mention the works of Bally and Kohatsu-Higa [BKH14] who discuss regularity of the density with respect
to the coeﬃcients of the SDE.

The parametrix technique for SDEs has been studied in many occurrences. Let us mention the works of
Kolokoltsov [Kol00] who ﬁrst studied the stable case, more recent works of Knopova and Kulik [KK14, KK15],
and Huang [Hua15]. In this paper, we aim to extend the result of Konakov et al. formulated for a Brownian
noise to the setting of [Hua15].

L. HUANG

We denote by [H] the following set of assumptions.

[H-1] (Zt)t≥0 is a symmetric L´evy process without Gaussian part. We denote by ν its L´evy measure. There is
a non increasing function ¯q : R+ → R+, µ a bounded measure on Sd−1, and α ∈ (0, 2) such that:

ν(A) ≤ZSd−1Z +∞

0

1A(sθ)

¯q(s)
s1+α dsµ(dθ) = m(A).

(1.3)

We assume one of the following:
[H-1a] µ has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the sphere.

[H-1b] there exists γ ∈ [1, d] such that µ(cid:0)B(θ, r) ∩ Sd−1(cid:1) ≤ Crγ−1, with γ + α > d, and for all s > 0, there

exists C > 0 such that ¯q(s) ≤ C ¯q(2s).

[H-2] Denoting by ϕZ the L´evy-Kintchine exponent of (Zt)t≥0, there is K > 0 such that :

E(cid:16)eihp,Zti(cid:17) = etϕZ (p) ≤ e−Kt|p|α

, |p| > 1.

(1.4)

[H-3] b, bn : R+ × Rd → Rd are measurable and bounded and σ, σn : R+ × Rd → Rd ⊗ Rd are bounded and
η-H¨older continuous η ∈ (0, 1). Also, when α ≤ 1, we impose b, bn = 0.
[H-4] σ, σn are uniformly elliptic. For all x, ξ ∈ Rd, there exists κ > 1 such that:

κ−1|ξ|2 ≤ hξ, σ(t, x)ξi ≤ κ|ξ|2,

κ−1|ξ|2 ≤ hξ, σn(t, x)ξi ≤ κ|ξ|2.

[H-5] For all A ∈ B, Borelian, we deﬁne the measure:

(1.5)

(1.6)

νt(x, A) = ν(cid:0){z ∈ Rd; σ(t, x)z ∈ A}(cid:1).

We assume these measures to be H¨older continuous with respect to the ﬁrst parameter, that is, for all A ∈ B,

|νt(x, A) − νt(x′, A)| + |νn

t (x, A) − νn

t (x′, A)| ≤ Cδ ∧ |x − x′|η(α∧1)m(A).

[H-6] We assume the following stability conditions. There is a sequence ∆n −→

n→+∞

0 such that

• Stability for the L´evy measures for all A ∈ B, t ≤ T ,

sup
x∈Rd

|νt(x, A) − νn

t (x, A)| + sup
x6=x′

• Stability for the drift coeﬃcient:

|νt(x, A) − νt(x′, A) − νn

t (x, A) + νn

t (x′, A)|

δ ∧ |x − x′|η(α∧1)

≤ ∆nm(A).

sup

|b(t, x) − bn(t, x)| ≤ C∆n.

(t,x)∈R+×Rd

Remark 1.1. The assumptions [H-5] and [H-6] can seem restrictive. However, in the case where σ is real and
a general L´evy measurethis assumption follows from the control in H¨older norm formulated in [KKM15].

It has been shown in [Hua15] that under assumptions [H-1] to [H-5], the parametrix representation for the

densities of (Xt)t≥0 and (X n

t )t≥0 holds. We will use the following notations throughout this paper:

p(t, s, x, z)dz = P(Xs ∈ dz|Xt = x), pn(t, s, x, z)dz = P(X n

s ∈ dz|X n

t = x).

Moreover, the following density bound holds:

p(t, T, x, y) + pn(t, T, x, y) ≤ C ¯p(t, T, x, y) :=

(T − t)−d/α

(cid:16)1 + |y−x|

(T −t)1/α(cid:17)γ+α Q(|y − x|),

where when [H-1a] holds, we take Q = ¯q and set γ = d and when [H-1b] holds, we take ¯Q(ρ) = min(1, ργ−1)¯q(ρ).
The aim of this paper is to quantify the distance between p and pn using ¯p and ∆n. Our main result is the
following:

Theorem 1.1. Fix a ﬁnite time horizon T > 0. There exists C > 0, for all t ≤ T and all x, y ∈ Rd, such that

|(p − pn)(t, T, x, y)| ≤ C∆n ¯p(t, T, x, y).

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we recall the background on the parametrix

technique. In Section 3, we prove the main result, using technical results that we prove in Section 4.

Remark 1.2. The bounded drift assumption comes from the fact that in the Lipschitz case, the density estimate
for the solution of the SDE involves the ﬂow of the ODE associated to the considered SDE. In our case, we
would have to compare the ﬂows θt,T (y) and θn

t,T (y), respectively solutions of the ODEs:

dxt
dt

= b(t, xt),

dxn
t
dt

= bn(t, xn

t ), xT = xn

T = y.

Thus, a comparison of the two ﬂows has to be done. Let us mention a similar procedure developed in [DM10],
where the initial ﬂow is compared to its linearization.

2. The parametrix Setting

In this Section, we recall some facts about the parametrix representation. The reader may consult Kolokoltsov
[Kol00] or Huang [Hua15] for a more extensive presentation. The idea is to set up a parametrix for both the
original SDE (Xt)t≥0 and the perturbed one (X n
t )t≥0, and compare the two representations. To that end, we
deﬁne two frozen processes. Fix a terminal position y ∈ Rd and consider:

˜Xs = x +Z s

t

σ(u, y)dZu, ˜X n

s = x +Z s

t

σn(u, y)dZu.

We omit the dependencies ˜Xs = ˜Xs(t, x, y) and ˜X n

s ) is the candidate to approximate Xs (resp. X n

s (t, x, y) in order to simplify the notations. Formally,
˜Xs (resp. ˜X n
s ). From assumption [H-2], it is clear that the
frozen processes have densities. Those densities depend on the frozen parameter y, and we write ˜p(t, T, x, y) =
˜py(t, T, x, y) (resp. ˜pn(t, T, x, y) = ˜py
Lemma 2.1. Fix a terminal time T > 0. There exist C > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ Rd:

n(t, T, x, y)). The following estimate is proved in [Hua15].

s = ˜X n

˜p(t, T, x, y) + ˜pn(t, T, x, y) ≤ C ¯p(t, T, x, y).

This estimate is established by comparing the frozen process to the driving noise. We know from Sztonyk
[Szt10] that under [H], density estimates holds for the driving process (Zt)≥0. Then, we can transfer the
estimates on the frozen process thanks to the uniform ellipticity of σ, σn. See [Hua15] for details.

The second step in the parametrix technique is to link the frozen process to the initial SDE. To that end, we

deﬁne the integro-diﬀerential operator:

Lt(z, ∇x)ϕ(x) = hb(t, z), ∇xϕ(x)i +ZRd

ϕ(x + σ(t, z)ξ) − ϕ(x) − h∇xϕ(x), σ(t, z)ξi1{|ξ|≤1}ν(dξ).

Observe that when x ∈ Rd is the initial condition of (1.1), then Lt(x, ∇x) is the generator of (Xt)t≥0 and for
y ∈ Rd a ﬁxed terminal point, Lt(y, ∇x) is the generator of the frozen process. With obvious notations, we also
denote Ln
t (z, ∇x) the generators of the perturbed equation, with bn and σn instead of b and σ. We have the
following result.

L. HUANG

Theorem 2.2. Under assumptions [H], XT (resp. X n
and the following representation holds:

T ) has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure,

p(t, T, x, y) =Xk≥0

˜p ⊗ H (k)(t, T, x, y), pn(t, T, x, y) =Xk≥0

˜pn ⊗ H (k)

n (t, T, x, y),

where H(t, T, x, y) =(cid:16)Lt(x, ∇x)−Lt(y, ∇x)(cid:17)˜p(t, T, x, y) and Hn(t, T, x, y) =(cid:16)Ln

Besides, ⊗ denote the space time convolution:

t (x, ∇x)−Ln

t (y, ∇x)(cid:17)˜pn(t, T, x, y).

ϕ ⊗ ψ(t, T, x, y) =Z T

t

duZRd

ϕ(t, u, x, z)ψ(u, T, z, y)dz, ϕ(k)(t, T, x, y) = ϕ(k−1) ⊗ ϕ(t, T, x, y),

and ϕ(0) = Id. Finally, the following density bound holds:

p(t, T, x, y) + pn(t, T, x, y) ≤ C ¯p(t, T, x, y).

We refer to Huang [Hua15] for the proof of this statement. The main idea of the proof is to prove a
regularisation property for H that allows to compensate the singularities induced by the generators. We deﬁne:

ρ(t, T, x, y) = δ ∧ |y − x|η(α∧1) ¯p(t, T, x, y), ¯H(t, T, x, y) =

δ ∧ |y − x|η(α∧1)

T − t

¯p(t, T, x, y).

It has been shown in [Hua15] that: |H(t, T, x, y)| + |Hn(t, T, x, y)| ≤ C ¯H(t, T, x, y). Thus, to control the series,
it suﬃces to control the iterated convolution of ¯p and ¯H. We deﬁne

ρ2k(t, T, x, y) =

ρ2k+1(t, T, x, y) =

(T − t)kω

k!ω2k (cid:16)(T − t)kω ¯p + (¯p + ρ)(cid:17)(t, T, x, y)
(k + 1)!ω2k+1(cid:16)(T − t)(k+1)ω ¯p + (T − t)ω(¯p + ρ) + ρ(cid:17)(t, T, x, y).

(T − t)kω

The following estimate has been proved in [Hua15]. For all t ≤ T , there exists C, C > 1 such that for all
x, y ∈ Rd:

|˜p ⊗ H (m)|(t, T, x, y) + |˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n |(t, T, x, y) ≤ C ¯p ⊗ ¯H (m)(t, T, x, y) ≤ Cmρm(t, T, x, y).

(2.1)

Using the last estimate, we can prove that the parametrix series is absolutely convergent. We can now use this
representation to control the distance between p and pn, in the lines of Konakov et al. [KKM15].

3. Proof of the Main Result

In this section, we prove our main result. We rely on technical results whose proofs are postponed to Section
4. The idea is to compare the two series representations and get an estimate for the diﬀerence of each term
involving ∆n ¯p(t, T, x, y). The proof is very similar to the proof of the convergence of the parametrix series.
Exploiting the parametrix representation for p and pn, we write:

|p(t, T, x, y) − pn(t, T, x, y)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+∞

Xk=0(cid:16)˜p ⊗ H (k) − ˜pn ⊗ H (k)

n (cid:17)(t, T, x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

We now control the series term by term. We proceed by induction. The ﬁrst term above is the diﬀerence

between the frozen densities. Taking β = 0 in Lemma 4.1 gives:

|˜p(t, T, x, y) − ˜pn(t, T, x, y)| ≤ C∆n ¯p(t, T, x, y).

(3.1)

DENSITY ESTIMATES FOR SDES DRIVEN BY TEMPERED STABLE PROCESSES

To control the next terms, observe that we can split for a general m ∈ N:

(3.2)

˜p ⊗ H (m+1) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m+1)

n

= ˜p ⊗ H (m+1) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n ⊗ H + ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

= (cid:16)˜p ⊗ H (m) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n (cid:17) ⊗ H + ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n ⊗ H − ˜pn ⊗ H (m+1)
n ⊗ (H − Hn).

n

We treat the two terms separately. First, we look of an estimate for ˜p ⊗ H (m) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n . We have the

following result:
Lemma 3.1. Fix T > 0. There exists C3.1 > 1 such that for all x, y ∈ Rd, ∀0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)˜p ⊗ H (m) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ∆n(C3.1)mρm(t, T, x, y).

Proof. We set C3.1 = C4.3 × C0, where C4.3 is the constant appearing in Lemma 4.3, and we proceed by
induction.

(H0): The case k = 0 follows from equation (3.1) since ρ(t, T, x, y) > 0.
(Hm ⇒ Hm+1): We split:

˜p ⊗ H (m+1) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m+1)

n

=(cid:16)˜p ⊗ H (m) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n (cid:17) ⊗ H + ˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n ⊗ (H − Hn).

Now we treat the two terms separately. It has been shown in [Hua15] that there exists C0 > 1 such that:

thus we have:

ρm ⊗ ¯H(t, T, x, y) ≤ C0ρm+1(t, T, x, y),

(3.3)

For the second term, we use estimate (2.1) and Lemma 4.3 to get

the estimate follows from the fact that C0 ≤ C4.3 × C0 = C3.1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)˜p ⊗ H (m) − ˜pn ⊗ H (m)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n (cid:17) ⊗ H(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (t, T, x, y) ≤ ∆n(C3.1)mρm ⊗ ¯H(t, T, x, y) ≤ ∆n(C3.1)mC0ρm+1(t, T, x, y),
n ⊗ (H − Hn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(t, T, x, y) ≤ ∆n(C3.1)mC4.3C0ρm ⊗ ¯H(t, T, x, y) ≤ ∆n(C3.1)m+1ρm+1(t, T, x, y).

(cid:3)

For the second part of the right hand side of (3.2), we can use the estimate (2.1) to control |˜pn ⊗ H (m)

n | by ρm
and Lemma 4.3 to control |H − Hn| by ∆n ¯H. We then estimate ρm ⊗ ¯H ≤ Cρm+1, thus we obtain a summable

bound with ∆n in factor. To complete the proof, it remains us point out thatPk≥0(C3.1)kρk < +∞, and that

the sum of the series yields the right hand side in Theorem 1.1.

4. Preliminary results

In this Section, we prove the estimates used un the last section. The proof our main result relies on an
estimation of the diﬀerence between the two parametrix representations. Therefore, we have to control the
diﬀerence of the frozen densities, and the kernels H, Hn.

Lemma 4.1. Let Φt(x, ∇x) be a pseudo-diﬀerential operator, and denote by φt(x, p) its symbol. Assume that
|φt(x, p)| ≤ C|p|β. There exists C > 0 for all t < T , for all x, y ∈ Rd, such that:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Φt(x, ∇x)(cid:16)˜p − ˜pn(cid:17)(t, T, x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C

L. HUANG

Note that taking β = 0 yields estimate (3.1).

To prove this Lemma, we rely on arguments developed in [Hua15]. Keeping the notations, we exhibited
how for ﬁxed times, the frozen process can be linked to the marginals of a L´evy process. Fix 0 < t < T , and
x, y ∈ Rd. Then

˜XT = x +Z T

where (Su)u≥0 is a L´evy process satisfying assumptions [H]. Precisely, let us denote by νS the L´evy measure of
S. There exists µS such that setting σv = σ((T − t)v + t, y), we have:

Exploiting the L´evy-Itˆo decomposition of Su = Mu + Nu, with M martingale and N compound Poisson

process, we can write:

˜p(t, T, x, y) =ZRd

pM (T − t, y − x − ξ)PNT −t(dξ),

where pM designates the density of the martingale and PNT −t (dξ) the law of the compound Poisson process.
The same decomposition holds for ˜X n
T . Now, we point out that the operator Φt(x, ∇x) acts on the variable x,
which is only present in the density of the martingale. Consequently, we have:

Φt(x, ∇x)(cid:16)˜p − ˜pn(cid:17)(t, T, x, y) = ZRd

To prove Lemma 4.1, we establish the following estimates. We refer to the procedure developed in Sztonyk

[Szt10] to see how these estimates can be used to derive the ﬁnal density estimate.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. We prove the ﬁrst estimate by invariance of the Schwartz’s space for the Fourier transform.
The Fourier transform of M writes:

(4.1)

(4.2)

ϕM (p) =ZRd(cid:16)eihp,ξi − 1 − ihp, ξi(cid:17)1{|ξ|≤(T −t)1/α}νS(dξ).

From [H-2], this Fourier transform is integrable, thus we can express the density of M as a Fourier inverse:

pM (T − t, y − x − ξ) =

1

(2π)d ZRd

e−ihp,y−x−ξi exp(cid:16)(T − t)ϕM (p)(cid:17)dp.

Consequently, the action of the pseudo-diﬀerential operator Φt(x∇x) writes:

The last inequality comes from assumption [H-2]. We now turn to the diﬀerence of the exponent ϕM − ϕM n .

Thus, the expression between brackets in (4.3) is in Schwartz’s space uniformly in the parameters λ, t, T, n,

thus so is its Fourier inverse, and estimate (4.1) follows.

We prove the next estimate by induction. We denote ¯νS(dz) = 1{|z|≤(T −t)1/α}νS(dz), the characteristic
measure of the compound Poisson process (Nu)u≥0. We know (see [Szt10]) that the law of (Nu)u≥0 actually

We now turn to the estimate on the diﬀerence of the parametrix kernels H − Hn. We have the following

estimate:
Lemma 4.3. There exists C4.3 > 0 for all t < T , for all x, y ∈ Rd, such that:

|H − Hn|(t, T, x, y) ≤ C4.3∆n

δ ∧ |y − x|η(α∧1)

T − t

¯p(t, T, x, y).

By deﬁnition of the parametrix kernel, we can split:

(H − Hn)(t, T, x, y) = (cid:16)Lt(x, ∇x) − Lt(y, ∇x)(cid:17)(cid:16)˜p − ˜pn(cid:17)(t, T, x, y)

+(cid:16)Lt(x, ∇x) − Lt(y, ∇x) − Ln

t (x, ∇x) + Ln

t (y, ∇x)(cid:17)˜pn(t, T, x, y).

The ﬁrst contribution is controlled by Lemma 4.1, since denoting by lt(z, p), ln
respectively, we have |lt(z, p)| + |ln
Lemma 4.4. There exists C > 0 for all t < T , for all x, y ∈ Rd, such that:

t (z, p)| ≤ C|p|α. Thus, we focus on the second contribution.

t (z, p) the symbols of Lt(z, ∇x), Ln

t (z, ∇x)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)Lt(x, ∇x) − Lt(y, ∇x) − Ln

t (x, ∇x) + Ln

t (y, ∇x)(cid:17)˜pn(t, T, x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C∆n

Proof. We focus on the integro-diﬀerential part of the generator. For the gradient part, the estimate stems from
the stability assumption on b − bn (see [H-6]). We recall the deﬁnition of:

δ ∧ |y − x|η(α∧1)

T − t

¯p(t, T, x, y).

νt(x, A) = ν({z ∈ Rd; σ(t, x)z ∈ A}), νn

t (x, A) = ν({z ∈ Rd; σn(t, x)z ∈ A}).

With this deﬁnition, observe that from the assumption on the L´evy measure, we can write:

= ZRd(cid:16)˜pn(t, T, x + z, y) − ˜pn(t, T, x, y) − h∇x ˜pn(t, T, x, y), zi1{|z|≤C(T −t)1/α}(cid:17)

where we deﬁne:

The proof follows from the upper bound L˜pn(t, T, x, y) ≤ C 1

T −t ¯p(t, T, x, y). From now, we follow the proof
in [Hua15]. The main idea is to split the operator in small and big jump contributions. Let us deﬁne the
following operators:

LM ϕ(x) = Z (T −t)1/α
LN ϕ(x) = Z +∞

(T −t)1/αZSd−1(cid:16)ϕ(x + ρθ) − ϕ(x)(cid:17)¯q(ρ)

dρ
ρ1+α µ(dθ).

Observe that due to the symmetry of µ, we can change the cut-oﬀ function so that the identity holds:

(cid:0)Lt(x, ∇x) − Lt(θt,T (y), ∇x)(cid:1)ϕ(x) ≤ LM ϕ(x) + LN ϕ(x).

We now handle separately the small and big jumps. Let us start with the small jumps. We claim that:

LM ˜p(t, T, x, y) ≤ C

δ ∧ |y − x|η(α∧1)

T − t

¯p(t, T, x, y).

(4.4)

Recalling the notations of [Hua15], the frozen density decomposes as

˜p(t, T, x, y) = pS(T − t, y − x) =ZRd

pM (T − t, y − x − ξ)PNT −t (dξ).

(4.5)

Plugging this identity in the deﬁnition of the operator LM yields:

LM ˜p(t, T, x, y) =ZRd

Observe that since the jumps are truncated, the density of the martingale pM is smooth. Moreover, the

successive derivatives of pM are be controlled as follows:

C(T −t)−d/α, we can take out the density and the integral yields the estimate(cid:12)(cid:12)LN ˜p(t, T, x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C

We can thus focus on the remaining integral. Assume ﬁrst that the diagonal regime holds, that is |x − y| ≤ (T −
t)1/α. In that case, note that ¯p(t, T, x, y) ≍ (T −t)1/α. Also, since we have the global estimate ˜p(t, T, x+ρθ, y) ≤
T −t ¯p(t, T, x, y).
Assume now that the oﬀ diagonal regime holds, that is |y − x| ≥ (T − t)1/α. The regime of ˜p(t, T, x + ρθ, y)
is given by |y − x − ρθ|. Thus, thanks to the triangle inequality, when |y − x| ≤ 1/2ρ, or when ρ ≤ 1/2|y − x|,
the density ˜p(t, T, x + ρθ, y) is oﬀ-diagonal with ˜p(t, T, x + ρθ, y) ≤ C ¯p(t, T, x, y), and we can conclude as in the
diagonal case. Consequently, the problematic case is when ρ ≍ |y − x|. Indeed, in this case, ˜p(t, T, x + ρθ, y)
can be in diagonal regime, when ˜p(t, T, x, y) is still in the oﬀ-diagonal regime.
