Results of experimental investigations of a neutron resonances width in planar waveguides using
the time-of-ﬂight reﬂectometer REMUR of the IBR-2 pulsed reactor are reported and comparison
with theoretical calculations is presented. The intensity of the neutron microbeam emitted from the
waveguide edge was registered as a function of the neutron wavelength and the incident beam angular
divergence. The possible applications of this method for the investigations of layered nanostructures
are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Neutron scattering is a powerful tool for investigations
of magnetic and nonmagnetic solids, polymers and bi-
ological objects. The commonly used beams have the
width of the order of 0.1 - 10 mm. For local investigation
of samples the more narrow beams are required. The var-
ious focusing devices [1] are able to decrease the width of
the neutron beam up to 50 µm. The smaller widths up to
0.1-10 µm can be achieved with the help of planar waveg-
uides, which transform collimated neutron macrobeams
into slightly divergent microbeams compressed in one di-
mension. The production of the unpolarized microbeam
at the steady-state reactors was reported in [2,3] and the
polarized one in [4]. The system of neutron microbeams
at the time-of-ﬂight reﬂectometer was registered in [5].
A combination of nonmagnetic neutron waveguide with
polarized neutron reﬂectometer [6] was used for the in-
vestigations of an amorphous magnetic microwire [7,8] by
the method of spin precession at transmission [9]. The
application of the neutron microbeam for the investiga-
tion of another microstructure outside the waveguide we
termed as Neutron Sonde Microscopy.

Inside a planar waveguide, the resonant enhancement
of the neutron wavefunction density takes place and the
enhanced neutron standing waves are formed. The pla-
nar waveguide is termed also as the resonator. The neu-
tron standing waves method was developed in [10].
It
is based on the theory of neutron resonances in layered
structures described in [11]. The neutron standing waves
can be registered as minima at the total reﬂection plateau
or maxima of a characteristic radiation: gamma-quanta
[12], alpha-particles [13], oﬀ-specular neutron scattering
[14,15], neutron channelling [16] or spin-ﬂip of polarized
neutrons [17].

The phenomenon of the neutron wave propagation
along the guiding layer inside the waveguide is termed as
Neutron Channeling. The theory of neutron channeling
in planar waveguides is described in [18]. The parame-
ter of the neutron wavefunction density decay termed as
the neutron channeling length was measured experimen-
tally in [19,20]. In [21] we proposed the method of Polar-

ized Neutron Channeling for the investigations of weakly
magnetic thin ﬁlms. In this case we register the neutron
microbeam but the investigated system is a weakly mag-
netic layer inside a planar waveguide. The position of
the microbeam peak on the neutron wavelength or the
glancing angle of the incident beam corresponds to the
waveguide structure and nuclear and magnetic potentials
averaged over the guiding layer thickness. But the width
of the microbeam peaks (or resonances) may deliver the
information about dispersion of the nuclear or magnetic
potentials.

In this communication we experimentally investigate
the width of the resonances by registering the neutron
microbeam emitted from the edge of a planar waveguide.

at PSD a two-dimensional map of neutron counts for any
glancing angle of the incident beam. One such a map
for the glancing angle of the incident beam θi = 3.69
mrad is presented in Fig.2. The horizontal axis corre-
sponds to neutron wavelength λ and the vertical one cor-
responds to the outgoing angle θ with respect to horizon.
The specularly reﬂected and direct beams were blocked
by Cd beam-stops as shown in Fig. 1a. The counts
near position of the direct beam correspond to the re-
fracted one. The spots marked by ellipses correspond
to the microbeams of diﬀerent resonance orders n = 0,
1, 2. The space distribution of the neutron microbeam
intensity reﬂects the two-dimensional distribution of the
neutron wavefunction density |Ψn(z, λ)|2 in the waveg-
uide [3], where z is the coordinate perpendicular to the
sample surface and n=0, 1, 2 ... is the resonance order.

scheme of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1a. The
resonant planar waveguide is a multilayer Ni67Cu33(20
nm)/Cu(150)/Ni67Cu33(50)//Si(substrate) with optical
nuclear potential shown in Fig. 1b. At room tempera-
ture the alloy Ni(67 % at.)Cu(33 % at.) is nonmagnetic.
The initial neutron beam falls onto the sample surface
under a grazing angle θi, and tunnels through the upper
layer into the wave guiding layer (channel) made of Cu.
Inside the middle layer the neutron wave density at some
wavelengths is resonantly enhanced. In the potential sys-
tem Fig. 1b three resonances of orders n = 0, 1, 2 can be
observed. The enhanced neutron wave after channeling
along the guiding layer reaches the exit edge and leaks
out through the gap of the width d equal to the thick-
ness of the channeling layer. The outgoing microbeam
has an angular divergence ∆θ, which is determined by
the law of the Fraunhofer diﬀraction ∆θ ∼ λ/d, where
λ is the neutron wavelength. The divergent microbeam
is registered by two-dimensional position-sensitive (PSD)
3He detector with spatial resolution 2 mm. The distance
sample-detector was 4.94 m. The full time-of-ﬂight base
was 33.94 m. The glancing angle of the incident beam
was ﬁxed at 3.69 mrad. The angular divergence of the
incident beam ∆θi has been varied and the width of the
microbeam intensity was measured as a function of the
neutron wavelength.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The parameters of the sample found in a neu-
reﬂectometry measurements were CuO(2.5

tron
nm)/Ni67Cu33(14.9)/Cu(141.7)/Ni67Cu33(53.3)//Si(substrate).
The nuclear potentials were found to be: CuO (45 neV),
upper layer Ni67Cu33 (245 neV), Cu(171 neV), bottom
layer Ni67Cu33 (219 neV), Si (54 neV).

pendence on the neutron wavelength and the scattering angle

With time-of-ﬂight technique it is possible to obtain

FIG. 3: The microbeam intensity integrated around the sam-
ple horizon as a function of the neutron wavelength at various
angular divergence of the incident beam: 0.60, 0.40, 0.20 and
0.10 mrad. The marked peaks correspond to resonances n=0,
1, 2, 3. (a) Narrow region near the sample horizon. (b) The
region outside the sample horizon. (c) Wide region between
the reﬂected and refracted beams.

In Fig. 3a, the dependence of the neutron intensity
registered by PSD on the neutron wavelength is shown for
the several angular divergences (FWHM) of the incident

was integrated over the angular range between specularly
reﬂected and the direct beams marked by two solid lines
in Fig. 2. The strong peak is the resonance order n=0.
The weak peak on the left side marked by the arrow is
the resonance order n=1. It is the part of the peak n=1
because the intensity distribution of this resonance has a
minimum near the horizon direction. One can see that
the width of the peak n=0 decreases with decreasing the
incident beam angular divergence. For the comparison,
in Fig. 3b the neutron intensity integrated outside the
central part near the horizon (Fig. 2) is presented. In
this ﬁgures, the peaks of the resonances n=0 are absent
and the peaks of the resonances n=1, 2, 3 are clearly
seen. The neutron intensity in Fig. 3c is the sum of the
integrated neutron intensities of Figs. 3a and 3b.

In Fig. 4a the width (FWHM) of the resonance n=0
peak of Fig. 3a is shown as a function of the incident
beam angular divergence (FWHM). Points are experi-
mental ones and the solid line is a linear ﬁt. One can see
the linear decrease of the wavelength width with decrease
of the angular divergence of the incident beam. The point
cut-oﬀ by the line on the axis mrad corresponds to the
wavelength width ∆λ=0.0356 ˚A.

To estimate the eigen width of the resonance n=0, we
have to extract the neutron wavelength resolution due to
the reactor pulse width. In Fig. 4b the neutron count
on the detector at the distance 33940 mm is presented as
a function of the time (points are experiment ones and
the line is a Gaussian ﬁt). The ﬁtted width of this peak
(FWHM) is 280 ± 6 (µs). This value of the reactor pulse
width corresponds to the neutron wavelength resolution
δλ=0.0326 ± 0.0014 (˚A) for the time-of-ﬂight method.
Thus, the experimental value of the internal width of
the resonance n=0 can be estimated as ∆λ0,exp= (∆λ −
δλ)=0.0030 ± 0.0014 (˚A).

IV. CALCULATIONS

Here we estimate the intrinsic width of the resonance
peak n=0 using the theory of the resonances [11]. Ac-
cording to this theory the wave function in the resonant
Cu layer can be represented as

where C is some normalization constant, which for conve-
nience is chosen here to be C=10−3, and the wave func-
tion in the channel is given in (1). This intensity for a
given θ=3.69 mrad is shown in Fig. 5. Four resonances
are clearly visible. Of course, their positions depend on
the incidence angle. It is because that Eq. (6) contains
kz, which for thermal neutrons is ≈ θ/λ, where is the
glancing angle of the incident beam, and its value for
thermal neutrons is of the order of 10−3. The larger is
θ, the larger is the resonance wavelength λn in (7).

The experimentally measured resonance peaks pre-
sented in Fig. 3a can be theoretically calculated by the
integration of (11) over the angular uncertainty ∆θ:

n=0, 1, 2, 3 are seen. The curves qualitatively agree with
experimental ones shown in Fig. 3a.

The result is presented in Fig. 6. The calculated peaks
are in good agreement with experimental ones shown in
Fig. 3a. It is also clear that the width of the n-th peak,
Γλn, can be represented as a linear function

Γλn ≈ ∆θλn + ∆λn,

(12)

which decreases with decrease of the angular uncertainty
and in the limit ∆θ=0 gives ∆λn (9) .

One can see that value of the calculated width (9) of
the resonance n=0 coincides with the experimentally es-
timated value within error bar due to the reactor pulse
width.

V. DISCUSSION

Neutron resonances in planar waveguides can be reg-
istered in two ways. One method is to observe minima
on the total reﬂection plateau of the specular reﬂectivity.
Another way is to observe maxima of the secondary radi-
ation such as alpha-particles and gamma-rays or the sec-
ondary channel of the neutron radiation like oﬀ-specular
neutron scattering, spin-ﬂip and the neutron channeling.
The secondary characteristic radiation can be used only
with special matter like 6Li or Gd. The secondary chan-
nel of neutron radiation can be used for many materials:
magnetic and nonmagnetic ones.

The neutron interaction with matter is weak as a
rule. Therefore the dips on the total reﬂection plateau
at resonances in planar waveguides are not deep (see
for instance [14,15]). At some special conditions the
dips at resonances can reach 0.5 of the total reﬂec-
tion [12,13].
It means that in the best case the ra-
tio eﬀect/background =0.5. The typical value is ef-

fect/background =0.1.

In the case of the neutron channeling and the mi-
crobeam registration, the ratio eﬀect/background can be
10 as one can see in Fig. 3a. It is 100 times better. In
the microbeam geometry one can eﬀectively separate the
useful neutrons from the background ones contained in
reﬂected, refracted and direct beams. It gives the possi-
bility to observe a low eﬀect at almost zero level of the
background.

VI. CONCLUSION

The width of the neutron resonances in planar waveg-
uides was investigated experimentally for the ﬁrst time
using the neutron channeling and the registration of
the microbeam emitted from the sample edge. Time-
of-ﬂight technique was used to measure the microbeam
peak width in dependence on the neutron wavelength
and the incident beam angular divergence. The linear
dependence was found. The measured experimental res-
onance peaks are well reproduced in calculations, which
proves that mathematical model for description of reso-
nant channeling is quite correct. We expect that method
of resonant channeling described in this communication
is quite sensitive and can be applied for investigation of
small eﬀects of nuclear or magnetic inhomogeneities of
the matter in layered nanostructures.
