Abstract: We discuss possibilities of measuring CP violation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet
Model by studying eﬀects of one-loop generated ZZZ and ZW W vertices. We discuss a set
of CP-sensitive asymmetries for ZZ and W +W − production at linear e+e−-colliders, that
directly depends on the weak-basis invariant Im J2 that parametrises the strength of CP
violation. Given the restrictions on this model that follow from the LHC measurements,
the predicted eﬀects are small. Pursuing such measurements is however very important,
as an observed signal might point to a richer scalar sector.

Anomalous contributions to trilinear electroweak vector boson couplings have been thor-
oughly studied [1–5] and searched for, at LEP [6], at Fermilab [7–10] and at the LHC
[11–21]. Experimentally, the

(1.2)

coupling is considered more challenging. Both classes may have a CP-violating, as well as
a CP-conserving part.

In the Standard Model (SM), at the tree level, only the γW W and ZW W couplings
are non-zero, whereas all four receive contributions at the one-loop level. In the SM, CP-
violating eﬀects can only be induced via the CKM matrix. However, at one-loop order,
there is no such contribution, since there might be only two relatively complex-conjugated
¯qq(cid:48)W vertices, hence CP-violating phases of the CKM matrix would cancel. An extended
Higgs sector may naturally modify this at the one-loop level, since new sources of CP
violation could enter in a non-trivial way.

As is well known, the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model allows for CP violation, either explicit
or spontaneous [22]. Early work on CP violation in the Higgs sector related it to the
couplings of neutral scalars to the electroweak gauge bosons, as well as to the charged
scalars [23, 24]. The conditions for having CP violation in the model can be expressed in
terms of three invariants, in Ref. [25] denoted Im J1, Im J2 and Im J3. If any one of them
is non-zero, then CP is violated [25] (see also Ref. [26]). Further criteria would allow to
distinguish spontaneous and explicit CP violation [25, 27].

Standard-model contributions to the ZZZ and ZW W vertices have been studied in [28]
and [29], respectively. Since there is some scope for further constraining or even measuring
CP violation in these couplings, we present an updated review of these observables, and
also propose some new ones.

The paper is organized as follows. After a brief review of the model and the basic CP-
violating invariants in section 2, we discuss one-loop contributions to the ZZZ and ZW W
vertices in sections 3 and 4. Selected CP-violating asymmetries that could be measured in
e+e− collisions are discussed in section 5, and concluding remarks are given in section 6.
Technical details are relegated to appendices.

2 The model

We adopt a standard parametrization for the scalar potential of the 2HDM (see, for exam-
ple, [30]) with

Φi =

(vi + ηi + iχi)/√2

ϕ+
i

i = 1, 2.

(2.1)

In the general CP-violating case, the model contains three neutral scalars, which are linear
compositions of the ηi and χi:

η1

with η3 a linear combination of the χi that is orthogonal to the Goldstone ﬁeld G0. Fur-
thermore, the 3 × 3 rotation matrix R satisﬁes

RM2RT = M2

diag = diag(M 2

1 , M 2

2 , M 2

3 ),

(2.2)

(2.3)

– 2 –

where M2 is the neutral-sector mass-squared matrix, and with M1 ≤ M2 ≤ M3.

The weak-basis invariants revealing CP violation were originally expressed by Lavoura,
Silva and Botella [23, 24], in terms of couplings and rotation-matrix elements. The notation
Im Ji, where the invariants were expressed in terms of potential parameters was introduced
by Gunion and Haber [25]. It was recently discussed in more detail by the present authors
[30] (where also Im J3 was replaced by another related invariant which we named Im J30).
The invariant Im J2, which represents CP violation in the mass matrix, can be written as

Im J2 =

(2.4)

where Mi are the neutral Higgs masses, and ei ≡ v1Ri1 + v2Ri2 represents their couplings
to a Z or a W (for a full dictionary of couplings determined by ei, see appendix B of
Ref. [30]).

We shall in this paper focus on processes in which Im J2 is responsible for the CP
violation. This invariant is the only one which does not involve charged scalars. Charged
scalars are involved in processes for which Im J1 and/or Im J30 are responsible for the CP
violation. For the explicit form of these invariants and processes to which they contribute,
we refer to Ref. [30].

3 The ZZZ vertex

Figure 1. The general ZZZ vertex.

One of the simplest vertex functions to which Im J2 contributes, is the eﬀective ZZZ
vertex discussed in appendix A. Since each ZHiHj vertex contains a factor ijk (see ap-
pendix B of Ref. [30]), it follows that i, j, k must be some permutation of 1, 2, 3 and thus
an over-all factor of e1e2e3 will emerge.

CP-violating form factors for triple gauge boson couplings have previously been studied

in the 2HDM in Refs. [31–33].

3.1 Lorentz structure

Phenomenological discussions [2–5] of the ZZZ vertex have presented its most general
Lorentz structure. In Ref. [4] the CP-violating vertex is analyzed, with all Z1, Z2, Z3 oﬀ-
shell. A total of 14 Lorentz structures are identiﬁed, all preserving parity. Some of these

– 3 –

Ref. [34].) We characterize them by momenta and Lorentz indices (p1, µ), (p2, α) and
(p3, β), and let Z1 be oﬀ-shell while Z2 and Z3 are on-shell. In addition, we assume that
Z1 couples to a pair of leptons e+e− and neglect terms proportional to the lepton mass.
Then according to [3] the structure reduces to the form1.

with e being the proton charge, the momenta (p1 incoming and p2, p3 outgoing) and Lorentz

conserves CP.

Our aim is to determine the CP-violating contributions to the ZZZ vertex, hence the
contributions to f Z
4 . Let us here make some qualitative comments. Summing over i, j, k
(see Fig. 12 in Appendix A) one might think that contributions to the triangle diagram
would pairwise cancel because of the factor ijk.
Indeed, the scalar triangle diagrams
do sum to zero, but there are non-vanishing tensor contributions, due to the momentum
factors at the ZHiHj vertices.

Three classes of Feynman diagrams give contributions to the eﬀective CP-violating
ZZZ vertex, all proportional to Im J2. They are triangle diagrams with HiHjHk along the
internal lines, as well as diagrams where one neutral Higgs boson is replaced by a neutral
Goldstone G0 ﬁeld, or a Z,

1Here, we follow the convention of Hagiwara et al [2], which we also adopt in section 4 for the ZW W
vertex by putting 0123 = −0123 = +1, whereas Gounaris et al [3] have chosen the convention where
0123 = +1.

This structure was identiﬁed 20 years ago by Chang, Keung and Pal [32], who studied
the set of diagrams presented in appendices A.1 and A.2. We ﬁnd numerically that our
result for the sum of these diagrams is identical to their result. There are, however, also
diagrams with an internal Z line, arising from the ZZHi vertex which was not included
in their study. These contributions are calculated in appendix A.3, and numerical studies
show that these are actually the dominant contributions.

For the neutral-Higgs masses

factor, e1e2e3/v3, is typically of O(0.1) (only small regions of the parameter space are

of deviation of the H1V V coupling from its SM strength, e1 = v(1− δ), and using e2

Contrary to the ZZZ vertex, the ZW W vertex is present at the tree level, with a

well-known, CP-conserving structure:

(4.1b)

where gZW W = −e cot θW , p1 is incoming while p2 and p3 are outgoing, and in the second
line, we make use of (cid:96) = p2 − p3.
Triangle diagrams discussed in appendix B contribute to the CP-violating ZW +W −
vertex. In fact, they give a contribution proportional to the invariant Im J2, which is one
measure of CP violation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet model [25] (referred to as J1 in earlier
work by Lavoura, Silva and Botella [23, 24]).

4.1 Lorentz structure

Phenomenological discussions [2] of the ZW W vertex have presented its most general
Lorentz structure. We let Z be oﬀ-shell while both W ± are on-shell, again assuming that
Z couples to a pair of leptons e+e− so that we may neglect terms proportional to the lepton
mass. Then according to [2] the structure reads

This quantity was also studied by He, Ma and McKellar [31]. Assuming that they have
used the (−i) prescription in their Eq. (5), we ﬁnd numerical agreement apart from an
overall sign. Furthermore, the result for the imaginary part given in their Eq. (6) is twice
as large as the one in Eq. (5).

5 Asymmetries
We are going to discuss the possibility of testing CP violation at future e+e− colliders [38,
39]. It is assumed that polarizations of the ﬁnal-state vector bosons could be determined
experimentally2. We adopt CP-sensitive observables deﬁned for W +W − and ZZ in [33, 40],
2Investigating angular distributions of the vector boson decay products one can indeed measure their

polarizations.

for the 2HDM.

e+e− → ZZ

5.1
Helicities of the ZZ (and W +W −) pairs can be measured statistically by studying decay
products of the ﬁnal vector bosons. Therefore, we will deﬁne a number of diﬀerential
asymmetries assuming that both the momenta and helicities of the ZZ pair could be
determined. Since our goal is to measure the CP-violating form factor f Z
4 , our asymmetries
will (to leading order) be proportional to f Z

4 . Let us ﬁrst start by considering

by the ﬁrst index λ, and deﬁning γ = √s1/(2MZ) and β2 = 1 − γ−2, we ﬁnd to lowest

These asymmetries are both shown in Fig. 5. The sharp peaks near the forward and
backward directions are due to an interplay of three factors: (1) the near-divergence of the
t-channel propagator, (2) the factor [∆σ∆λ(1 + β2)− 2 cos Θ] of the amplitude (see Eq. (5)
in ref. [32]) and (3) the Wigner functions proportional to 1 ± cos Θ.

The asymmetries AZZ and ˜AZZ are both shown in Fig. 6 for three values of the energy.

sion is forward-backward symmetric. At high energies and intermediate angles, it is well
approximated by AZZ (cid:39) −4γ4ξ Im f Z

6 Discussion

The mixing of CP-even and odd components of the scalar ﬁelds lead to couplings among all
pairs of neutral mass eigenstates and the gauge particles, which in turn lead to loop-induced
trilinear couplings among the electroweak gauge particles, W and Z. The CP-violating part
of these couplings, which we have discussed here, are all proportional to the quantity Im J2.
This quantity Im J2 is proportional to the product of couplings e1e2e3, as well as to the
product of diﬀerences of masses squared, (M 2
3 ), see Eq. (2.4).
Obviously, having all three masses diﬀerent is a necessary, but not suﬃcient condition for
CP violation. Any one of the neutral Higgs particles could be odd under CP, with the
other two even. This would be reﬂected in a vanishing product e1e2e3.

Properties of the Higgs boson observed at the LHC [41–43] match those expected for
the SM. As has been discussed in [30, 44–46], the standard nature of the Higgs boson doesn’t
preclude the presence of interesting relatively low-scale BSM physics. This landscape is
being referred to as the alignment limit. If we take the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson
to be the lightest one, H1, then the alignment limit implies

e1 → v,

e2 → 0,

e3 → 0,

(6.1)

where v = 246 GeV. Hence, in this exact limit, Im J2 vanishes, and the CP-violating eﬀects
discussed in this paper, would all vanish. (Actually, also Im J1 would vanish.) In general,
if we parametrize the deviation of the H1V V coupling from its SM value by δ, such that
e1 = v(1 − δ), then one can show that for small δ

However, the scalar sector of the 2HDM might still oﬀer CP violation in the align-
ment limit, represented by the remaining invariant Im J30 [30]. This quantity can only
be accessed via measurements involving pairs of charged Higgs bosons, and is thus not
easily studied. Thus, for the near future, the best prospects for ﬁnding CP violation in the
2HDM lie probably in these trilinear vector couplings, together with some deviation from
the alignment limit [36, 37, 47, 48].

These eﬀects of CP violation might be worth looking for also at the LHC, where in
Drell–Yan processes a cut on rapidity makes it possible to statistically distinguish the quark
from the antiquark direction [49]. An eﬃciency study might be worthwhile.

Of course, if an eﬀect were to be found in ZZZ or ZW +W − trilinear couplings, at a

level beyond that expected in the 2HDM, that would point to some other new physics.

In the covariant gauge, there are also contributions from triangle diagrams with one of the
Higgs ﬁelds replaced by the Goldstone ﬁeld G0. A representative case is shown in Fig. 13.
There are similar diagrams with a G0 along either of the other two internal lines, but no
diagram with two or three internal G0 lines due to the non-existence of a ZG0G0 coupling.

can not be more than one internal Z-line due to the absence of a tree-level ZZZ vertex.

A.4 Bubble diagrams

There are diagrams with a bubble connecting a Za (a = 1, 2, 3) with an intermediate Hj,
as shown in Fig. 15.

These diagrams contribute terms proportional to Im J2. There are also diagrams with
the internal Z replaced by a G0. However, these diagrams are all scalar, proportional to
pµ
1 gαβ (and similarly for bubbles on the other legs) and will not be further discussed.

A.5 Tadpole diagrams

There are also tadpole diagrams yielding a structure proportional to Im J2. A representative
case is shown in Fig. 16. However, these are canceled by counter terms, in order to give a
vanishing expectation value for the Hj ﬁeld at the one-loop order [50].

B The ZW +W − vertex
Triangle diagrams of the kind shown in Fig. 17 contribute to the CP-violating ZW +W −
vertex. In fact, they give a contribution proportional to the invariant Im J2.

Furthermore, at the SM level, there are contributions from fermion loops. But these

do not contribute to f Z

4 and will be ignored.

C Extracting Im J2 — a case study

We have claimed in Sections 3 and 4 that the contributions to f Z
from the diagrams
4
studied in Appendices A and B are proportional to Im J2. However, Im J2 is not explicit
in the expressions (3.4) and (4.4). The expressions contain the factor e1e2e3, but the
factor (M 2
1 − M 2
1 ) is not explicitly visible. This remaining factor is
“hidden” in the linear combination of C-functions. One readily ﬁnds numerically that the
expressions for f Z
4 vanishes whenever two of the scalars have the same mass, but extracting
the “hidden” factor (M 2
2 −M 2
1 ) analytically is not easily done. Making
some assumptions makes this task easier.

in the asymptotic limit (large s1 ≡ p2

in terms of scalar loop integrals A0, B0 and C0 [51]. The explicit forms of these scalar loop
integrals are all known [52]. They can be expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms.
The resulting expression is very lengthy and complex, so we prepare to study the expression
in the asymptotic limit by introducing new variables:

Both x and y are small in the asymptotic limit. Expanding Σ in power of x and y, we
