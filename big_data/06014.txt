Models of bacterial growth tend to be ‘irreversible’, allowing for the number of bacteria in a
colony to increase but not to decrease. By contrast, models of molecular self-assembly are usually
‘reversible’, allowing for addition and removal of particles to a structure. Such processes diﬀer in a
fundamental way because only reversible processes possess an equilibrium. Here we show at mean-
ﬁeld level that dynamic trajectories of reversible and irreversible growth processes are similar in
that both feel the inﬂuence of attractors, at which growth proceeds without limit but the intensive
properties of the system are invariant. Attractors of both processes undergo nonequilibrium phase
transitions as model parameters are varied, suggesting a uniﬁed way of describing reversible and
irreversible growth. We also establish a connection at mean-ﬁeld level between an irreversible model
of growth (the magnetic Eden model) and the equilibrium Ising model, supporting the ﬁndings made
by other authors using numerical simulations.

Introduction. Physical growth processes can be re-
versible, allowing for the number of particles present in
a system to increase and decrease, or irreversible, allow-
ing only for an increase of particle number. For exam-
ple, bacterial colony growth is usually considered to be
irreversible, because bacteria multiply but do not dis-
appear [1, 2]. By contrast, models of molecular self-
assembly are usually reversible, allowing for particle at-
tachment and detachment [3–6]. The two types of process
are fundamentally diﬀerent in that reversible processes
possess an equilibrium at which growth ceases, while ir-
reversible processes do not. Usually one of these pro-
cesses is chosen to model a particular physical system,
and so comparison between the two is rarely made. Here
we compare reversible and irreversible stochastic growth
processes in a mean-ﬁeld (space independent) setting.
We show that despite their diﬀerences in respect of equi-
librium, the two types of process can display similar be-
havior when growth is allowed to proceed without limit.
Speciﬁcally, ensembles of dynamic trajectories are gov-
erned by attractors in phase space at which the averaged
properties of the system, scaled by system size, are in-
variant. These attractors undergo nonequilibrium phase
transitions as model parameters are varied, suggesting a
uniﬁed way of describing reversible and irreversible pro-
cesses. For one particular irreversible process, a mean-
ﬁeld version of the magnetic Eden model (MEM) [1, 7, 8],
we show that its nonequilibrium phase behavior is that
of the mean-ﬁeld equilibrium Ising model. This ﬁnding
provides additional evidence for a “nontrivial correspon-
dence between the MEM for the irreversible growth of
spins and the equilibrium Ising model” (in distinct spatial
dimensions) conjectured by other authors on the basis of
numerical simulations [7, 8].

Modeling reversible and irreversible growth. We con-

freedom and resolving only the numbers of particles in
the system. By ‘reversible’ we mean simply that parti-
cles may enter and leave the system, and we intentionally
do not require that rates are derived from the principle of
detailed balance. We consider growth of a system com-
posed of two types of particle, labeled ‘red’ and ‘blue’.
The state of the system is deﬁned at any instant by the
number of red particles r and blue particles b it contains,
or equivalently by the system’s ‘size’ N ≡ b+r and ‘mag-
netization’ m ≡ (b− r)/(b + r). We add blue particles to
the system with rate λb, and red particles with rate λr.
We remove blue and red particles from the system with
respective rates γb and γr. For an irreversible process
these latter two rates are zero. We allow rates to de-
pend on the instantaneous magnetization of the system
but not (directly) its size. We impose this requirement in
order to model a notional growth process in which rates
of particle addition and removal to a structure scale with
the size of the interface between the structure and its
environment. We then assume the limit of a large struc-
ture whose interfacial area does not change appreciably
during the growth process, and we divide addition and
removal rates by the (constant) surface area in order to
obtain the rates stated above.

We studied this class of growth processes using a
continuous-time Monte Carlo protocol [9]. To interpret
these simulations we derived a set of analytic expressions
for averages over dynamic trajectories, in the limit of
vanishing particle-number ﬂuctuations (see Sections S1–
S3). Under these conditions the net rates of addition
of blue and red particles are Γb(m) = λb − γb and
Γr(m) = λr − γr. The time evolution of system size
˙N = Γb + Γr. The requirement for equilibrium, by
is
which we mean a zero-growth-rate stationary solution,
is Γb(m0) = 0 = Γr(m0), where m0 is the magneti-
zation of the system in equilibrium. These relations
can be satisﬁed by a reversible process but not an ir-
reversible one, except in the trivial limit of zero addi-
tion rate. Thus only a reversible process has an equi-
librium for which ˙N = 0 = ˙m. However, both types

of process admit a steady-state growth regime for which
˙N > 0 and ˙m = 0. The time evolution of magnetization
is ˙m = N−1 [Γb − Γr − m(Γb + Γr)], which vanishes for

m = m(cid:63) such that

m(cid:63) =

Γb(m(cid:63)) − Γr(m(cid:63))
Γb(m(cid:63)) + Γr(m(cid:63))

.

(1)

Thus there exist nullclines, at which ˙m = 0, in the space
of dynamic growth trajectories. The existence of such
nullclines requires only that net rates of particle addition
are positive, whether or not removal rates vanish, and
so can be displayed by reversible and irreversible pro-
cesses. We shall show that these nullclines can be attrac-
tors, stable with respect to perturbations, and so consti-
tute ﬁxed lines to which dynamic trajectories ﬂow. Fur-
thermore, these attractors undergo nonequilibrium phase
transitions as model parameters are varied.

We now specialize the discussion to two models that
might be regarded as reversibly- and irreversibly growing
versions of the mean-ﬁeld Ising model. The irreversible
stochastic process we consider is a space-independent ver-
sion of the magnetic Eden model [1, 7, 8], closely related
to a model studied in Ref. [10]. Addition of red and blue
particles occurs with rates that are Arrhenius-like in the
energy of interaction between a single particle and the
system, λr = 1
2 emJ+h. Here J is
the interparticle coupling and h a magnetic ﬁeld (we set
m = 0 when N = 0). We allow no particle removals, set-
ting γb = γr = 0. There is therefore no equilibrium. The
analytic evolution equations, averaged over trajectories,
read ˙N = cosh(mJ + h) and

2 e−mJ−h and λb = 1

˙m = N

−1 [sinh(mJ + h) − m cosh(mJ + h)] ,

and admit the nullcline

m(cid:63) = tanh(m(cid:63)J + h).

(2)

(3)

This equation is equivalent to the well-known mean-ﬁeld
expression for Ising model thermodynamics [11, 12]. For
h = 0, Equations (2) and (3) indicate that the nullcline
m(cid:63) = 0 is an attractor for J ≤ Jc = 1 and a repeller
for J > 1. For J > 1 two symmetric attractors emerge
as m(cid:63)± ∼ ±(J − 1)1/2. In other words, these equations
describe a continuous phase transition of dynamic trajec-
tories that are ‘unmagnetized’ for J < 1 and ‘magnetized’
for J > 1, via a critical point at J = 1. Thus, at mean-
ﬁeld level, nonequilibrium trajectories of the magnetic
Eden model possess phase behavior identical to that of
the equilibrium Ising model [13]. This result provides
an analytic connection between models supporting the
ﬁndings of Refs [7, 8], which demonstrated a numerical
equivalence between phase transitions, in distinct spa-
tial dimensions, of Eden and Ising models (see also [2]).
This result also appears to be consistent with general ar-
guments suggesting that probabilistic irreversible cellular
automata with Ising-like symmetry lie in the universality
class of the equilibrium Ising model [14] (see also [6, 15]).

at zero magnetization. Parameters: (a) J = 2.5 and c = 2,

The reversible model we consider is the stochas-
tic process whose ﬂuctuation-free limit is described in
Refs. [16, 17]. We assume constant rates of particle ad-
dition, λb = pc and λr = (1 − p)c, where c is a notional
‘solution’ concentration and p is the fraction of particles
in solution that are blue. To make contact with Ising
model nomenclature we introduce the magnetic ﬁeld h

that these rates are intentionally not designed to sat-

librium. The ﬂuctuation-free evolution equations are

Thus the equilibrium phase behavior of this model is iden-
tical to the nonequilibrium phase behavior (3) of the ir-
reversible model, and to the equilibrium phase behavior
of the mean-ﬁeld Ising model.

Persistently-growing trajectories admit the nullcline

c (m(cid:63) − tanh h) =(cid:0)1 − (m(cid:63))2(cid:1) sinh(m(cid:63)J).

(6)

This nullcline is diﬀerent in detail to that of the irre-
versible model, Eq. (3). However, (6) and (4) describe,
for J < √6, a similar nonequilibrium continuous phase
transition between unmagnetized and magnetized trajec-
tories. The ‘magnetic’ critical exponent is 1/2, as for the
irreversible case, i.e. magnetization emerges for J > Jc
as m(cid:63)± ∼ ±(J − Jc)1/2, where Jc = c is the critical point
of the reversible process.
In Fig. 1 we show the nonequilibrium phase diagrams
derived from (2), (3), (4) and (6). These diagrams indi-
cate the nature of the dynamic attractors m(cid:63) in a space
of model parameters: in regions U and M the stable at-
tractors possess zero and nonzero magnetization, respec-
tively. Both models exhibit phase transitions at which
the nature of the attractors changes qualitatively.

following every Monte Carlo move.

tity var(|M|)/(cid:104)N(cid:105), where M = mN , behaves similarly).
For both models χ displays at the critical point a peak
that increases in height with average system size as
(cid:104)N (t)(cid:105)0.82(1) over the time interval shown (see inset to
Fig. 3(b)). While individual trajectories ﬂow to stable
attractors as time increases, thereby causing var(|m|)
to decrease with time, the same trajectories also ac-
quire more particles, and the combination (cid:104)N(cid:105) var(|m|)
increases with time over the interval simulated. Such
‘sharpening’ of a phase transition with increasing time is
reminiscent of behavior seen in glassy models that display
phase transitions in space-time [18]. In the asymptotic
limit (when N → ∞ and m = m(cid:63) is constant) we expect
the evolution of M = mN to resemble that of a random
walker, and so var(|M|) ∝ t. Thus ensembles of trajec-
tories feel the eﬀect of dynamic attractors, but can in
certain regimes of phase space take considerable time to
reach them.

In some limits the two types of process can be clearly
distinguished. All growth processes must eventually end.
A bacterial colony will run out of food, and a self-
assembled structure will come to equilibrium with its en-
vironment. In this limit the diﬀerence between reversible
and irreversible processes becomes apparent. In Fig. 4 we
show dynamic simulations of the reversible model carried
out in the presence of an additional rule that forbids any
addition that would cause the system to contain more
than 103 particles. During the growth phase dynamic tra-
jectories fall under the inﬂuence of the dynamic attrac-
tor, but when the system size limit is reached trajectories
evolve to an attractor similar to that of the equilibrium
one; see also the line labeled ‘constrained’ in Fig. 3(a).
Trajectories of the irreversible model, in the presence of
a size constraint, simply cease to evolve. The behavior
of the reversible model gives insight into the behavior of
the lattice models of growth of Refs. [16, 17]. These mod-
els obey detailed balance, and so must eventually evolve
to equilibrium, but during a period of growth they dis-
play nonequilibrium behavior consistent with that of a
persistently-growing process. The present results indi-
cate that one can consider dynamic trajectories of a re-
versible growth process to feel the eﬀect of both nonequi-
librium and equilibrium attractors, the relative inﬂuence
of which varies over the lifetime of the trajectory.

Conclusions. We have shown at mean-ﬁeld level that
reversible and irreversible growth processes are similar
in that both admit attractors in the space of dynamical
trajectories. At these attractors growth proceeds without
limit, but averaged intensive properties of the system are
time-invariant. Attractors of both types of process can
undergo similar nonequilibrium phase transitions. We
have also established a connection at mean-ﬁeld level be-
tween an irreversible model of growth (the magnetic Eden
model) and the equilibrium Ising model, supporting the
ﬁndings made by other authors using numerical simu-
lations. There is sustained interest in nucleation and
growth pathways of molecular [19], active [20] and liv-
ing [1] matter. Our results indicate that certain qualita-

as N increases (because, for large N , ﬂuctuations of
particle number change magnetization by an amount

[10]). However,
ensembles of trajectories show behavior characteristic of
a phase transition.
In Fig. 3(a,b) we show averages of
|m(t)| over 105 dynamic trajectories generated at several
diﬀerent values of J. We deﬁne averages of an observable
i=1 Ai(t), where Ai(t) is the
value of A(t) for the ith of K trajectories. Trajectory
averages evolve as t increases toward the attractor. This
evolution is in general slow, because the mobility of
individual trajectories is low:
ignoring ﬂuctuations we
expect small departures (cid:104)δm(t)(cid:105) from the attractor to
decay – above, at, and just below the critical point – as
t−q, (ln t)−1/2, and t2q, respectively, where q = 1 − J for
the irreversible process and q = (c − J)/(c − 1) for the
reversible one.
Trajectory-to-trajectory ﬂuctuations, which are ne-
glected by our analytic expressions, also show behav-
ior characteristic of a phase transition.
In Fig. 3(c,d)
we show the trajectory-to-trajectory ﬂuctuations of mag-

insensitive to details of the microscopic transition rates

S1. STOCHASTIC MODELS OF GROWTH

The stochastic processes described in the main text can be described using a master equation. Consider the probability
P (r, b; t) that a system at time t contains r ≥ 0 red and b ≥ 0 blue particles. For brevity we will write this probability
as P (r, b), with the time-dependence of the function being implicit. We add red particles to the system with rate
λr(r, b) and blue particles with rate λb(r, b), and remove red and blue particles with respective rates γr(r, b) and
γb(r, b). The master equation for this set of processes is

∂tP (r, b) = λb(r, b − 1)P (r, b − 1) − λb(r, b)P (r, b)
+ λr(r − 1, b)P (r − 1, b) − λr(r, b)P (r, b)
+ γb(r, b + 1)P (r, b + 1) − γb(r, b)P (r, b)
+ γr(r + 1, b)P (r + 1, b) − γr(r, b)P (r, b).

We set γb(r, 0) = 0 = γr(0, b) so that we cannot have a negative number of particles of either color. By multiplying
both sides of (S1) by the arbitrary function U (r, b) and summing over b and r we obtain the evolution equation for
the quantity U averaged over dynamic trajectories, (cid:104)U (r, b)(cid:105) ≡

r,b=0 U (r, b)P (r, b):

(cid:80)∞

(S1)

∂t(cid:104)U (r, b)(cid:105) = (cid:104)[U (r, b + 1) − U (r, b)] λb(r, b)(cid:105)
+ (cid:104)[U (r + 1, b) − U (r, b)] λr(r, b)(cid:105)
+ (cid:104)[U (r, b − 1) − U (r, b)] γb(r, b)(cid:105)
+ (cid:104)[U (r − 1, b) − U (r, b)] γr(r, b)(cid:105).
Setting U (r, b) = b gives the rate of change of the mean number of blue particles,

The corresponding equation for red particles is

∂t(cid:104)b(cid:105) = (cid:104)λb(b, r)(cid:105) − (cid:104)γb(b, r)(cid:105).

∂t(cid:104)r(cid:105) = (cid:104)λr(b, r)(cid:105) − (cid:104)γr(b, r)(cid:105).

(S4)

We can obtain closed-form equations for rates of change of particle number by making a mean-ﬁeld approximation,
replacing averages over functions f of r and b with functions f of the averages of r and b, i.e. writing (cid:104)f (r, b)(cid:105) =
f ((cid:104)r(cid:105),(cid:104)b(cid:105)). To simplify notation we then replace (cid:104)r(cid:105) → r and (cid:104)b(cid:105) → b, so that (S3) and (S4) read

˙b = λb(b, r) − γb(b, r);
˙r = λr(b, r) − γr(b, r).

The size of the system is N = r + b, and so its growth rate is

In equilibrium we must have the vanishing of (S5) and (S6), giving

IRREVERSIBLE MODEL OF GROWTH

(S11)

The irreversible model described in the main text allows no particle removal, γb(r, b) = 0 = γr(r, b). Blue particles
are added with an Arrhenius-like rate that assumes Ising-like interaction interaction energies between red and blue
particles with coupling J and magnetic ﬁeld h (we take kBT = 1),

Here the spatial mean-ﬁeld approximation is apparent, i.e. particles ‘feel’ only the average magnetization of the whole
system. We have absorbed the particle coordination number, assumed to be constant, into J. Similarly, red particles

The temporal evolution to the attractor (S16) diﬀers in diﬀerent regimes of parameter space. Consider the case of
vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. For a small departure δm from the attractor, m(t) = m(cid:63) + δm(t), we have from (S14)
N ≈ cosh(m(cid:63)J)t. Inserting this result into (S15) and using (S16) gives

In the unmagnetized region (J < 1) we have m(cid:63) = 0, and so ∂tδm ≈ (J − 1)δm/t. Thus temporal relaxation to the
attractor is algebraic, with a continuously varying exponent: δm ∼ tJ−1. In the magnetized region (J > 1, m(cid:63) (cid:54)= 0)
relaxation to steady-state is also algebraic, δm ∼ tJ(1−(m(cid:63))2)−1. Close to the critical point, where J ≈ 1, we have
from (S16) that (m(cid:63))2 ≈ 3(J − 1)/J 3, and so δm ∼ t2(1−J) to leading order in J − 1. Thus the (moduli of) exponents
two terms on the right-hand side of (S18) vanish. We then have ∂tδm ∝ −(δm)3/t, and so δm ∼ (ln t)−1/2.

either side of the critical point are distinct. At the critical point we have J = 1 and m(cid:63) = 0, in which case the ﬁrst

For the reversible model we have constant rates of particle addition, λb(r, b) = pc and λr(r, b) = (1 − p)c, where c
is a notional ‘solution’ concentration and p is the fraction of particles in solution that are blue. To make contact
with Ising model nomenclature we introduce the magnetic ﬁeld h via p ≡ eh/(2 cosh h). Particle unbinding rates are
Arrhenius-like, appropriate for particles escaping from a structure via themal ﬂuctuations (we take kBT = 1):

where the magnetization of the system is again m ≡ (b − r)/(b + r). We assume that blue particles possess energy
of interaction −s with blue particles and −d with red particles (we have absorbed factors of coordination number,
assumed to be constant, into these energetic parameters). We have deﬁned the parameters Σ ≡ (s + d) /2 and
∆ ≡ (s − d) /2. The prefactor of the exponential ensures that blue particles leave the system with a rate proportional
to their relative abundance in the system. For red particles we choose the unbinding rate

Note that the equilibrium concentration for h = 0 is the same for red (m0 < 0) and blue (m0 > 0) solutions, i.e. c0

In the main text we assume an Ising-like hierarchy for the interaction energies of this model, in which case ∆ = J
and Σ = 0. With these choices Equations (S28), (S30), and (S31) are equations (5), (4), and (6) of the main text

Analysis of (S31), for h = 0, gives rise to Fig. 1(a) of the main text. The function on the right-hand side of (S31)

vanishes at m = 0 and at m = ±1, and has one turning point for positive m and one for negative m. When ∆ < √6

this function takes its largest positive gradient, ∆, at the origin. Therefore it intersects the function cm on the
left-hand side of (S31) three times if c < ∆ (with two non-negative solutions, m±, stable to perturbations of m, and
one, at m = 0, unstable) and only once (at m = 0) if c > ∆. When c = ∆ all solutions lie at m = 0. The solutions
m± move smoothly away from m as c is decreased below ∆, and do so as

Thus at the point c = ∆ (for h = 0 and ∆ < √6) we have a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition separating
zero- and nonzero magnetization solutions to Eq. (S31).
For h = 0 and ∆ ≥ √6 we can have zero, three or ﬁve solutions to (S31), depending on the value of c, and respectively

zero, two and three of those solutions are stable.

As for the irreversible model, temporal relaxation to the attractor m(cid:63) varies by parameter regime. Expanding (S27)
and (S30) for m(t) = m(cid:63) + δm(t) gives, for m(cid:63) = 0,

In the unmagnetized region c > ∆ we then have δm ∼ t
Expanding (S27) and (S30) for m(t) = m(cid:63) + δm(t) and using (S32) reveals that in the magnetized region we have
