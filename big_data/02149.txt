Abstract Clues to the origins and evolution of our Galaxy can be found in the kine-
matics of stars around us. Remnants of accreted satellite galaxies produce over-
densities in velocity-space, which can remain coherent for much longer than spatial
over-densities. This chapter reviews a number of studies that have hunted for these
accretion relics, both in the nearby solar-neighbourhood and the more-distant stellar
halo. Many observational surveys have driven this ﬁeld forwards, from early work
with the Hipparcos mission, to contemporary surveys like RAVE & SDSS. This
active ﬁeld continues to ﬂourish, providing many new discoveries, and will be rev-
olutionised as the Gaia mission delivers precise proper motions for a billion stars in
our Galaxy.

1 Introduction to kinematic streams

At ﬁrst glance the kinematics of disk stars in the solar neighbourhood might appear
to be a smooth distribution, but upon closer inspection one can uncover a wealth of
structure. The fact that this velocity distribution is clumpy has been known for over
a century. The German astronomer J.H. von M¨adler, while carrying out observations
to measure the Sun’s motion, noticed clumping in the distribution of proper motions
(M¨adler, 1846). This collection of stars moving with the same velocity, what we
now refer to as a “moving group”, consists of members of the Pleiades open cluster,
including stars several degrees from the centre of the cluster. This work was build
on by Proctor (1869), who found a further two moving groups - Hyades and Sirius.
The dissection of the local stellar velocity distribution has told us a great deal
about star formation and Galactic structure. Figure 1 presents a contemporary anal-
ysis of the velocity distribution, showing that it is rich in substructure. These mov-

ing groups can be attributed to young open clusters which have not yet dispersed, or
could be due to dynamical effects such as stars trapped at resonance with the Galac-
tic bar or spiral arms (e.g. Dehnen & Binney, 1998; Bovy & Hogg, 2010; Sellwood,
2010; McMillan, 2011). However, neither of these will be explored in this chap-
ter; interested readers are suggested to see Antoja et al. (2010) for a detailed and
comprehensive review on the subject of moving groups. Instead we will here focus
primarily on a third mechanism for creating moving groups, namely the accretion
of extra-galactic systems.

As can be seen from the other chapters in this volume, we know of many tidal
streams in the stellar halo of the Milky Way. However, more diffuse streams, which
are created if the progenitor is less massive, is on a highly eccentric orbit, or was
tidally disrupted in the distant past, are harder to identify as spatial over-densities on
the sky. They can, however, be discovered by exploring higher-dimensional space;

The scale of the top indicates the estimated density in units of stars per bin of 0.5 km/s x 0.01 dex. Figure from Antoja et al. (2008).     On the other hand, a wide range of metallicity was found for each branch, especially for Hercules with a higher metallicity dispersion. The WD revealed a complex relation between kinematics and metallicity (Figure 7). For the three branches of Hyades-Pleiades, Coma Berenices and Sirius the more negative the V components, the higher the mean metallicity. The Hercules branch does not follow the overall pattern of the three main branches. The metallicity of the Hyades-Pleiades branch shows a two-peak distribution ([Fe/H] ~-0.5 and [Fe/H] ~-0.15) which seems related to the kinematic groups of Hyades (more metallic) and Pleiades. To conclude, these observational results suggest ruling out those models that propose that these kinematic structures are remnants of disc star clusters.  5. METHODS TO STUDY THE DYNAMICS OF MOVING GROUPS Studies such as Antoja et al. (2008) (see Section 4) showed that stars in a given group, seem to have a wide range of ages and metallicities, or distributions similar to those observed for the whole sample under study. As this is in contradiction with the hypothesis of cluster disruption, a considerable amount of work has been done in an attempt to explain differently the origin of moving groups. One of the recently explored possibilities is that moving groups are imprints of non-axisymmetric components of the MW: the bar and the spiral arms (Section 2.4).

a stream can that has dispersed in conﬁguration space, may still remain coherent
in phase space. In this chapter the many successful efforts to ﬁnd fainter and more
ancient accretion events will be reviewed, starting with the solar neighbourhood
(Section 2) and moving out to structures in the more distant halo (Section 3).

2 Local kinematic streams

2.1 The Helmi stream

In the 150 years since M¨adler made his initial discovery, many other studies have
identiﬁed kinematic substructures. Some of these, such as the Arcturus or Kapteyn
group, have been proposed to be extra-galactic in origin (we will return to these
later). However, the ﬁrst indisputable accretion remnant was found by Helmi et al.
in their seminal 1999 paper (Helmi et al., 1999), which we will now discuss.

The ﬁrst step to identifying clumping in velocity space is, by deﬁnition, obtaining
a sample of accurate velocities. Large surveys have been crucial in propelling many
ﬁelds in astronomy, from Kapteyn’s visionary international survey of the early 20th
century (Kapteyn, 1906; Kinman, 2000; van der Kruit, 2015), to the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey in the early 21st (York et al., 2000); for a review of many signiﬁcant
results from such surveys in the ﬁeld of Milky Way science, see Ivezi´c et al. (2012).
One of the most important surveys in the past 20 years in the ﬁeld of stellar kinemat-
ics was the Hipparcos mission. This was a European-led satellite mission, launched
in 1989 and operated until 1993, which measured the position of stars to unprece-
dented accuracy. This enabled a catalogue of proper motions and parallaxes to be
constructed for over 100,000 stars (ESA, 1997), although the complex nature of
this task meant that the ﬁnal deﬁnitive catalogue was only published in 2007 (van
Leeuwen, 2007a,b).

Possessing such accurate proper motion data for large numbers of stars enables
statistically meaningful analyses to be done of rare types of stars. For arguably the
ﬁrst time researchers were able to construct signiﬁcant samples of stars from the
halo, which remember constitutes only around 0.5 per cent of the stellar mass in the
solar neighbourhood (Juri´c et al., 2008). With this sample, one could now begin to
search for kinematic over-densities.

The groundwork for Helmi’s discovery was laid in the 1999 paper entitled
“Building up the stellar halo of the Galaxy” (Helmi & White, 1999). This paper
used a combination of numerical simulations and analytic analysis to investigate
the disruption of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into the Milky Way, paying
particular attention to the consequences for the local stellar halo. By analysing the
disruption of the satellite using action-angle variables, they studied how the tidal
stream evolved over 10 Gyr, and showed that the system became phase mixed; at a
particular location (for example in the solar neighbourhood) one might detect mul-
tiple kinematic over-densities from the same progenitor. This is because one (large)

4

progenitor can produce a tidal stream that wraps multiple times around the Milky
Way, and can produce numerous separate clumps in phase space. A simple calcu-
lation shows that if the local stellar halo is entirely made up of debris from 10-100
accreted satellites (of luminosity 1e7 or 1e8 L(cid:12)) then one would expect to ﬁnd a
few hundred separate kinematic streams in the solar neighbourhood, although the
individual stars in these streams would not necessarily be clumped in density.

Given the high quality data that was becoming available at that time, namely the
aforementioned Hipparcos catalogue, Helmi et al. (1999) were able to construct a
catalogue of 97 metal-poor red giants and RR Lyrae stars within 1 kpc of the Sun
(using data compiled by Beers & Sommer-Larsen (1995) and Chiba & Yoshii (1998)
With distances estimated from photometry (to ∼ 20 per cent), radial velocities from
spectroscopy (to ∼ 10 km/s) and proper motions mainly from Hipparcos (to a few
mas/yr), then were then able to analyse the phase-space distribution of this halo
sample.

One then needs to determine the optimal space (combinations of x, y, z, vx, vy,
and vz) in which to identify accretion debris. To do this one normally identiﬁes
integrals of motion, i.e. quantities that are conserved (or approximately conserved)
along an orbit (see section 3.1.1 et seq of Binney & Tremaine, 2008); stream stars are
thus clumped in these quantities. For example, in a spherical potential we know that
the total energy and the three components of angular momentum are all conserved
along an orbit, leading to four integrals of motion. However, the Milky Way is not a
spherical system, particular in the inner regions where the contribution of the disk to
the total potential is important. Fortunately it is close to being axi-symmetric (since
we do not need to worry about the Galactic bar, which is restricted to the inner-
most few kpc). For an axi-symmetric system, there are two integrals of motion:
the energy, and the component of the angular momentum parallel to symmetry axis
(Lz). It can also be shown that the total angular momentum, although not precisely
conserved, varies only slightly for modest amounts of ﬂattening and, importantly,
shows no long-term evolution.

There are small complications to this picture. First, the stars of a satellite galaxy
do not all follow the same precise orbit, due to the internal velocity dispersion of
the system. This means that stars will have a ﬁnite volume in this space deﬁned by
the integrals of motion. Second, the potential of the Milky Way will undoubtedly be
varying over the time-scales under discussion, for example from the build-up of the
disk as gas settles into the equatorial plane of the Galaxy. This leads to an oft-used
term in this ﬁeld - adiabatic invariants (see section 3.6 of Binney & Tremaine, 2008).
These are quantities that are constant for slowly-evolving potentials, i.e. potentials
that vary on time-scales longer than typical orbital periods.

x + L2

and L⊥ =(cid:113)L2

For their analysis, Helmi et al. (1999) chose to use the 2-dimensional space of Lz
y. They did this as the former is conserved for an axi-symmetric
potential and, since L2 = L2⊥ + L2
z and both L and Lz are approximately constant for
stars in a particular tidal stream, the latter is not expected to vary signiﬁcantly. These
two quantities were selected because they are trivial to determine for their sample,
unlike the energy which, although conserved, requires one to assume a model for

gravitational potential. The distribution of Lz and L⊥ is shown in Fig 2. For a local
sample of stars Lz ≈ R(cid:12).vφ , where vφ is the azimuthal component of the velocity.
Since the stellar halo shows no signiﬁcant signs of rotation (e.g. Smith et al., 2009b),
one would expect that the distribution should be symmetric about Lz = 0; clearly
this is not the case at high L⊥, where there is a signiﬁcant cluster of stars in the
region (Lz, L⊥) = (1000, 2000) kpc.km/s. The probability of such a clump of 7 stars
occurring by chance is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. Although their original
halo sample contained only 97 stars, they augmented it with more distant and more
metal-rich stars, obtaining a total of 12 stars that belong to this overdensity.

They also investigated the velocity distribution of this stars from this system (top
panels of Fig. 2; see also Figure 1 of Chapter 1 which shows a subset of the sample
in a slightly different coordinate system). Note that in Helmi’s coordinate system,
positive Lz implies vφ is in the same direction as Galactic rotation, so these stars
have azimuthal velocities similar to the Sun, but with very high vertical velocities (as
can be seen from the top panels of Fig. 2, vz is around 200 km/s). It is also interesting
to see that vz is split into two separate clumps – one moving downward and one
upward. This is most-likely a manifestation of the aforementioned phase-mixing,
where one progenitor can produce multiple streams in phase-space. So although
there are two streams, these stars are all from the same accretion event. Helmi and
collaborators constructed an N-body simulation of this system, which provides a
very good representation of the observed velocity distribution (Fig. 2). This shows
how the progenitor can be almost completely disrupted in conﬁguration space, yet
remain coherent in velocity space. The two separate clumps in vz are reproduced,
as is the spread in vR. The simulation also allows them to estimate the properties of
the progenitor, which they concluded was likely to be similar in size to the Fornax
dwarf spheroidal.

Subsequent studies have conﬁrmed the Helmi stream and increased the number
of member stars, though somewhat reducing the fraction of the halo it comprises (for
example Chiba & Beers (2000); Re Fiorentin et al. (2005); Dettbarn et al. (2007);
Kepley et al. (2007) Later surveys containing fainter stars have enabled us to identify
halo subdwarfs in this system (Klement et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009b), bringing
the total number of members to over 30 out to distances of a few kpc. The reported
fraction of local stellar halo made of Helmi stream debris varies from reference to
reference, probably due to differences in search techniques, but is most likely around
5 per cent. The chemistry of 12 of these stars has been investigated by Roederer et al.
(2010). They ﬁnd a spread in [Fe/H] from −3.4 to −1.5, with detailed abundances
similar to that of the general halo population, concluding that star formation in the
progenitor was truncated before the products of Type Ia supernovae or AGB stars
enriched the inter-stellar medium.

The Kepley reference also introduces a novel way to estimate the age of accre-
tion. They utilise the fact that once the progenitor has become completely phase-
mixed, the total number of stars in the positive and negative vz clumps would be the
same. The observed fraction with positive vz is actually 28 per cent, which means it
is not entirely mixed. By analysing an N-body simulation of the accretion (similar
to the right-panel of Fig. 2), they can tentatively say that it was likely to have been

accreted between 6 and 9 Gyr ago, i.e. not too recently (otherwise the ratio would be
more lopsided) and not too long ago (otherwise the ratio would be closer to unity).

2.2 Other early discoveries

As pointed out in the introduction, moving groups have been studied for many years,
but deﬁnitively determining their origins is not easy. As a consequence, ﬁnding halo
streams in the solar neighbourhood can be a precarious venture. Over-densities, as
their name suggests, can only be identiﬁed as an excess on top of a background
population. However, in this case the background population in question (the Milky
Way disk) is far from a simple homogeneous population; lumps and gradients can
often masquerade as coherent structures and so great care has to be taken in their
classiﬁcation. This problem has afﬂicted many potential stream discoveries and, as
can be seen in this chapter, ambiguities still remain for a number of these.

Various streams, such as Hyades-Pleiades, Hercules and Arcturus, are believed to
be Milky Way stars brought together by resonances in the disk (as mentioned in the
introduction to this chapter). Originally identiﬁed by Eggen (see his 1996 review),
the broad metallicity or age spread of these three streams argues against disruption
of a disk star cluster as the origin, and abundance patterns similar to disk stars dis-
favours the extragalactic scenario, hence the conclusion of a dynamical origin (e.g.
Famaey et al., 2008; Bovy & Hogg, 2010; Fuchs & Dettbarn, 2011). Some of these
are more controversial than others; the Arcturus stream has generated much debate
(e.g. Navarro et al., 2004), but more-recent analyses have shown that the narrow ve-

Kinematically Detected Halo Streams

locity dispersion (Bovy et al., 2009) and chemical inhomogeneity (Williams et al.,
2009; Bensby et al., 2014) favor a dynamical origin. Making deﬁnitive claims about
the origins of such systems is not easy.

Another stream that has been studied extensively is the Kapteyn moving group,
again named by Eggen. The name comes from the fact that the velocities of this
group are similar to that of Kapteyn’s star, which is a well-known very high proper
motion star only 4 pc away from the Sun. This group is on a mildly retro-grade orbit,
moving at around −50 km/s.

Quite early it was speculated that this retro-grade group might be related to the
globular cluster Omega Cen (e.g. Eggen, 1978), which is on a similar orbit. This
cluster is interesting as it appears to possess a broad spread in both chemistry and
age, indicating that it could be the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy (Lee et al., 1999).
This might suggest that this retrograde moving group is in fact the stripped remnants
of the galaxy. A number of works have pursued this hypothesis (see Majewski et al.
2012 for a nice overview of the current situation), including a detailed spectroscopic
analysis of 16 stars by Wylie-de Boer et al. (2010). This latter reference conﬁrms the
similarity in chemistry between the cluster and the moving group, but provocatively
questions whether the group may in fact be material stripped from the host galaxy
of Omega Cen as it was disrupted. The reason is that one would need a signiﬁcant
amount of dynamical friction to bring the system onto its current orbit, something
which would not be possible for an object as small as Omega Cen. However, the
authors acknowledge that their hypothesis is currently unproven; if they are correct
that Omega Cen and the Kapteyn moving group do not originate in the same dwarf
galaxy progenitor, then why the close similarity in chemistry and why the age spread
in the cluster? Clearly more work needs to be done to address this question and fully
understand the connection, especially given that a large fraction of the inner halo
could belong to this moving group (see, for example, Majewski et al. 2012; Fig. 3)
and hence it could have played a signiﬁcant role in the early development of our
galaxy.

2.3 Streams in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey

2.3.1 Pieces of the puzzle

Although Hipparcos was (and still is) clearly a hugely important resource for study-
ing the kinematics of stars in the solar neighbourhood, it was hampered by a lack
of radial velocities. What was needed was a systematic survey of radial velocities,
providing a sample with a well-deﬁned selection function. The Geneva-Copenhagen
survey (Nordstr¨om et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2007, 2009; Casagrande et al.,
2011) produced radial velocities and metallicities for 13,000 nearby stars. Com-
bining these with proper motions and (for the majority of stars) distances from the
Hipparcos mission, resulted in a complete sample of F- and G-type dwarfs within
40 pc and a larger, magnitude-limited sample to around 200 pc. Although this is a

relatively local sample compared to the one analysed in Helmi’s 1999 study, and
contains only a handful of halo stars, the accurate 6D phase-space information al-
lows a detailed analysis of the orbital properties of the stars.

In addition to the Helmi stream, which is the most prominent in the local stel-
lar halo, a number of other candidate streams have been found. Helmi continued
her analysis using this Geneva-Copenhagen survey (Helmi et al., 2006), choosing
a different space to search for accretion debris than in their 1999 study. This time
they chose three parameters, L z (which, as mentioned above, will be conserved in
an axi-symmetric system) and the peri- and apo-centre distances (the minimum and
maximum distance that the star’s orbit comes to the Galactic centre). We will re-
fer to this as the APL space (Fig. 4). Using simulations they showed that disrupted
satellites remain reasonably localised in this space, with the extent depending on
the initial size of the satellite. When projected into the 2D space of apo- versus
peri-centre distance, debris remain contained within a band of constant eccentricity,
implying that the stars approximately retain the eccentricity of their progenitor’s or-

bit. Moreover in this space one can see the different kinematic streams forming as
the satellite becomes phase mixed, although the accuracy required to determine this
is not feasible with current datasets.

One clear drawback of this method is that it relies on a knowledge of the gravita-
tional potential in order to calculate apo- and peri-centre distances. However, as the
sample under investigation is such a small volume, the potential is approximately
constant and hence the orbital parameters are determined by the kinematics, rather
than their location. This means that although the apo- and peri-centre distances may
be slightly off due to an incorrectly chosen potential, this will result in a systematic
shift in this space and will not work to smear out any coherent features.

By comparing the density of stars in this 3D space to Monte Carlo realisations of
a smooth model, they were able to show that their distribution is signiﬁcantly more
structured than what one would expect from a smooth model. They went on to iden-
tify a group of stars with eccentricities around 0.4. This value is clearly inconsistent
with the thin disk, although thick disk stars may posses such high eccentricities.
Folding in metallicities appears to show that this group can be divided into three
separate accretion events, with different trends in vz and age.

Fig. 4 Distribution of overdense cells in the apo-centre/peri-centre/angular-momentum (APL)
space. Each panel shows the distribution of stars in the space of apo- and peri-centre (for different
cuts in the L z angular momentum). Darker colours correspond to higher statistical signiﬁcance of
an excess compared to the smooth background. Notice the group of stars conﬁned within the dot-
ted lines (corresponding to eccentricities between 0.3 and 0.5). As L z increases, the orbits move
outwards in radii. Taken from Helmi et al. (2006).

The process of determining exactly how many distinct groups are contained in
such a discovery is complex and open to interpretation. High-resolution follow-up
studies have analysed the elemental abundance patterns of these stars and suggested
that there may actually be only two distinct groups (Stonkut˙e et al., 2012, 2013;
ˇZenovien˙e et al., 2014); the common abundance patterns suggests that Groups 2 &
3 from the original Helmi et al. (2006) paper may come from the same progenitor.

that more work needs to be done as ages are notoriously difﬁcult for main-sequence
stars. They conclude by speculating that the similarity between the chemical com-
position of stars in these two kinematic groups and in the Milky Way’s thick disk
suggests that the progenitor of this system may be related to the formation of the
thick disk.

The original authors revisited these streams in Helmi et al. (2014), obtaining
high-resolution for even more stars in this eccentricity range (0.3-0.5). Although
they no longer focus on the division proposed in their original paper, they show
that the properties of stars in this eccentricity range are not homogeneous, with an
apparent division around [Fe/H] = −0.4 dex.

2.3.2 Arifyanto & Fuchs

In the same year as the Helmi et al. were mining the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, a
group in Germany Arifyanto & Fuchs (2006) were searching for accretion debris in
a sample of 742 stars based on a catalogue from Carney et al. (1994). This resulted
in the detection of a number of streams, but none are believed to be due to accretion;
three had been previously identiﬁed (Hyades-Pleiades, Hercules and Arcturus; dis-
cussed above) and there was a new discovery, again not conclusively extragalactic
in origin (Ramya et al., 2012).

However, despite not identifying any bone-ﬁde accretion remnants, this paper
warrants discussion here for its approach to identify nearby streams. Using a Kep-
lerian approximation for orbits developed by Dekker (1976), they determine prox-
ies for the total angular momentum and eccentricity, along with a third parameter
corresponding to the inclination of the orbit (see Klement 2010 for a review of this
method). They argue that this three dimensional space is ideal for dissecting velocity
space, as evidenced by their success at ﬁnding the above disk streams. This method
is simple to apply and unlike the previous APL approach does not require orbits to
be calculated, but it is not perfect as it relies on the aforementioned Keplerian ap-
proximation that only holds for spherical potentials. Despite these drawbacks it has
√
proved a popular approach that has been used by numerous authors, mainly by em-
U 2 + 2V 2). Although the approximations
ploying the proxy for the eccentricity (
behind this proxy break down for high eccentricities, overdensities should remain
coherent, and so the simplicity of this approach has resulted in its widespread use.
Another early paper to adopt this technique was Dettbarn et al. (2007), who anal-
ysed the sample of Beers et al. (2000) and found a number of candidate halo streams,
including existing groups (such as the Helmi stream) and some new ones (named,
S1, S2, and S3).

2.4 The modern era

2.4.1 The RAVE survey

11

It should be evident by now that progress in understanding the formation and evolu-
tion of our galaxy rests on large surveys. We will now discuss two inﬂuential surveys
in this ﬁeld from the past decade: the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Both of these have led to numerous discoveries,
as can be seen from this and many other chapters in this volume.

Taking a kinematic census of large populations of the Milky Way requires both
photometric and spectroscopic surveys. Many proper motion catalogues have been
assembled, often by combining various existing ground-based astrometric surveys
(e.g. the Hipparcos catalogue, UCAC4, PPMXL, etc, etc). Spectroscopic surveys
are in some sense rarer as it requires signiﬁcant telescope time to amass spectra for
hundreds of thousands of stars. One of the largest such surveys is the RAVE survey
(Steinmetz et al., 2006), which began in 2003 on the 1.2m UK Schmidt Telescope at
the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Despite not being particularly new (it was around
30 years old when the survey started) or having a large aperture, it had a number of
important assets: the ﬁeld of view was very large (6 degree diameter ﬁeld); it had
relatively high multiplexing capabilities (150 ﬁbers per plate); and, crucially, for
most of the survey it had dedicated use of the telescope. The combination of these
factors allowed RAVE to efﬁciently produce large catalogues of radial velocities and
abundances, resulting in a ﬁnal catalogue of around 500,000 stars in the Southern
hemisphere with magnitude range 9 < I < 12 (the fourth public data release is
presented in Kordopatis et al., 2013). By concentrating on a narrow window around
the calcium triplet region (8410–8795 A) with reasonable resolution (R ˜ 7500),
the radial velocity accuracy is excellent, at around a couple of km/s (see Fig. 29 of
Kordopatis et al., 2013). Furthermore, stellar parameters can be derived at a level of
around a few tenths of a dex for log(g) and metallicity (see Table 2 of Kordopatis
et al., 2013). . For the higher signal-to-noise spectra it is even possible to estimate
abundances for a number of individual elements, such as Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and
Ni (Boeche et al., 2011; Kordopatis et al., 2013). If we are interested in learning
about the kinematics of stars, the ﬁnal piece of information is distances, which can
be estimated by combining the observed stellar parameters with stellar models. This
was ﬁrst undertaken by Breddels et al. (2010) and subsequently reﬁned by Zwitter
et al. (2010) and Binney et al. (2014b).

With all this information in hand, RAVE has proved to be a hugely important
survey for understanding the kinematics of the solar-neighbourhood, for example
Binney et al. (2014a). In terms of streams, the ﬁrst attempt to investigate this was
Seabroke et al. (2008). By looking at stars from a couple of surveys, including
RAVE, they came to the conclusion that there were no massive streams (with hun-
dreds of stars) present in the dataset. They contrasted this to the situation in the
outer halo (see Section 3 of this chapter, as well as other chapters in this volume),
where the system is clearly far from relaxed and contains a number of streams and
substructures. The results here are in agreement with previous studies, for example

12

Martin C. Smith

the work of Gould (2003), which used a sample of 4,000 halo stars with proper mo-
tions to conclude that no more than 5 per cent of the local halo can be made up of a
single stream. At ﬁrst glance this may appear to conﬂict with some estimates for the
density of the Helmi et al. (1999) stream discussed above, but one should note that
their discovery is made up of two separate kinematic streams due to the extensive
phase-mixing (Fig. 2).

Fig. 5 Distribution of kinematic over-densities in RAVE, as presented by Klement et al. (2008).
The upper-left panel shows the full distribution of the observed dataset, which can be compared
to the expected distribution from a smooth model (upper-right) and its corresponding dispersion
(lower-left). By subtracting the data from the model, normalised by the dispersion, one obtained
the distribution of overdensities (lower-right). This reveals known substructures, such as Hercules,
and new ones, such as KFR08. This ﬁgure is taken from the later analysis presented in Klement
et al. (2011).

The ﬁrst attempt to systematically search for small-scale clumping in velocity
space in the RAVE survey was undertaken by Klement et al. (2008), who adopted
the Keplerian approximation described in the previous section. One issue here is
that 6D phase-space is required and, back in 2008, distances has not yet been esti-
mated for RAVE stars. To overcome this issues they made the naive assumption that
the sample would be dominated by main-sequence stars and applied a simple mono-
tonic colour-magnitude relation suitable for dwarf stars. Due to the bright magni-
tudes that RAVE probes, this assumption is rather weak and it was subsequently
found that around half of the stars are likely to be giants or sub-giants (e.g. Binney
et al., 2014b). They later rectiﬁed this issue (Klement et al., 2011), basically ﬁnding

that their results were unchanged. Despite this problem in their original paper, they
were still able to recover a number of existing streams, calculating their signiﬁcance
by comparing to expectations from a smooth background model (Fig. 5). One new
stream (dubbed “KFR08”) was also detected at a level of 3-sigma. Despite being rel-
atively metal-rich (−1 < [Fe/H] < 0) and on a pro-grade orbit (with v phi of around
160 km/s), the high vertical velocity (vertical dispersion being around 100 km/s) in-
dicates that this unlikely to be associated to the disk and is therefore believed to
be the remnant of an accreted satellite. This was later analysed by Bobylev et al.
(2010) in a sample constructed from Hipparcos stars with accurate trigonometric
parallaxes (van Leeuwen, 2007a) and metallicities and ages (Holmberg et al., 2007,
2009); by identifying additional giant stars in this stream they were able to identify
the main sequence turnoff and, through isochrone ﬁtting, determining this is likely
to be a very old stream (likely 13 Gyr in age). We will return to this stream brieﬂy
in the following section, as it is was subsequently conﬁrmed using an independent
data set.

As discussed above, determining the origin of moving groups can be tricky due
to the complex nature of the background in which they reside (i.e. the Milky Way
disk). This difﬁculty is highlighted by another candidate stream identiﬁed by the
RAVE survey, entitled the Aquarius Stream (Williams et al., 2011). Is was discov-
ered through its radial velocity offset from the surrounding population (Fig. 6) –
a cluster of 15 stars localised on the sky and with very similar metallicities. This
old stream was not connected to any other existing structures and they concluded
that it was likely recently stripped material from a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy.
However, despite being relatively close by (most of the stars are within a few kpc),
uncertainties in the distances and proper motions mean that the clumping in angular
momentum space is inconclusive.

At this point detailed abundances are required to deﬁnitely determine the ori-
gin of this stream. Two teams took up this task, one led by Wylie-de Boer et al.
(2012) using the AAT telescope and one led by Casey et al. (2014) using the Mag-
ellan Clay telescope. Unfortunately, instead of clarifying the issue, these studies
raised more questions than they answered. The ﬁrst analysis (Wylie-de Boer et al.,
2012) looked at six member stars, concluding that the exceptionally tight metallicity
spread (σ ([Fe/H]) = 0.1 dex) and abundance ratios unambiguously show that the
Aquarius stream is a disrupted globular cluster. The second analysis (Casey et al.,
2014), on the other hand, looked at ﬁve stars and unambiguously found that this sys-
tem cannot be a disrupted globular cluster, giving their paper the unequivocal title
“The Aquarius comoving group is not a disrupted classical globular cluster”. Af-
ter ﬁnding a wide metallicity spread (σ [Fe/H] = 0.4 dex) that is inconsistent with
a globular cluster and abundance ratios that are inconsistent with a dwarf galaxy,
they conclude that the stars are indistinguishable from the Milky Way ﬁeld pop-
ulation. The coherence in their kinematics may be a result of the perturbation of
the disk when a satellite fell in, but this is just conjecture and their main conclu-
sion is that the chemistry of these stars clearly show that they are not the accreted
remnants of either a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy. The fact that any two studies
disagree is not surprising. What IS surprising is that one cannot easily explain away

14

this discrepancy on the grounds of small number statistics, since these two analyses
have four stars in common! So the fact that very different conclusions have been
reached is hard to reconcile, although the higher signal-to-noise of the Casey et al.
study certainly works in their favour and they consequently argue that the Wylie-de
Boer et al. metallicities may be inaccurate. To conclude, the nature of the Aquarius
stream/group is still open for debate.

Fig. 6 These plots, from Williams et al. (2011), show the disputed Aquarius stream/group. Despite
the strong signature in kinematics (which we see localised at vlos ∼ −200 km/s), it is still argued
whether this is the remnant of a disrupted globular cluster (Wylie-de Boer et al., 2012) or just a
perturbation in the disk (Casey et al., 2014).

2.4.2 The SDSS survey

In terms of studies of the Milky Way, another major survey in the past decade has
been the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The photometric part of the survey has
led to the discovery of a host of new streams and dwarf galaxies, including a new
population ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (see Belokurov 2013 for a recent review). Fur-
thermore it has spurred on many different analyses on the state of the disk both
through its photometry and spectroscopy (for example, see review articles by Ivezi´c
et al. 2012 and Smith et al. 2012).

The sub-project dedicated to stellar spectroscopy, called the Sloan Extension for
Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE; Yanny et al. 2009), was included
in SDSS-II and SDSS-III and collected spectra for nearly 350,000 stars. There were
also a large number of stars targeted in the other sub-projects (over 300,000) and
although they have a very complex selection function, these stars are still useful for
studies of the Milky Way. These SDSS spectra were taken at a much lower resolution
than RAVE (with R ≈ 2000) but with a much broader wavelength coverage (3800-
9200 A). With this data the SDSS team were able to measure stellar parameters

but of course these are harder to determine and, at the time of writing (i.e. Data
Release 12), are yet to be ofﬁcially released as part of the SDSS survey. Despite
not being ofﬁcially released, a number of authors have used these alpha-element
abundances, for example measuring the abundance “knee” of the Sagittarius stream
(de Boer et al., 2014). The spectroscopy has also led to a variety of papers on the
Milky Way disk, most provocatively the series of papers led by Jo Bovy arguing
that the thick disc is not a separate entity from the thin disk (Bovy et al., 2012). The
SDSS survey is still ongoing, with the stellar spectroscopy now undertaken by the
ambitious APOGEE project, which will be discussed later in Section 4.

The search for phase-space substructures in SDSS was undertaken by Klement
et al. (2009) and Smith et al. (2009b), using complimentary datasets and techniques.
Klement et al. took the seventh data release from SDSS and applied the same meth-
ods as used during their search for overdensities in the RAVE survey. Since the
SDSS stars are much fainter than the RAVE stars, proper motions are generally less
precise. Therefore in order to reduce the corresponding uncertainties in tangential
velocities, they decided to focus on stars within 2 kpc of the Sun. They were able to
conﬁrm their candidate overdensity from the RAVE survey (the KFR08 group, dis-
cussed above), further breaking this into two separate groups, one of which is likely
to have a disk origin (R1) and one of which is likely accretion debris (R2). They also
conﬁrm one of the previously mentioned streams from Dettbarn et al. (2007), adding
more members and arguing that this is actually smeared out in phase-space, result-
ing in multiple clumps in their analysis. As with most works, the Helmi stream was
found with very strong signiﬁcance. Finally, two additional candidate halo streams
were identiﬁed (C1 & C3).

At the same time as Klement et al. (2009) were working on their paper, Smith
et al. (2009b) were working on an independent study using SDSS data. Their ap-
proach was complimentary in that it was able to probe much greater distances thanks
to precise proper motions from Bramich et al. (2008). These proper motions were
constructed using the 250 sq. deg. Stripe 82 region of SDSS, which was repeatedly
monitored primarily for the purpose of detecting supernovae. However, the multiple
epochs are also ideal for constructing proper motion catalogues. The fact that the
proper motions come from a single survey avoids the problem of cross-matching
data from separate telescopes with often very different conditions and imaging sys-
tems, signiﬁcantly reducing the systematic errors. Despite the relatively short base-
line (seven years), proper motions were measured to a few mas/yr precision, even
at faint magnitudes. Koposov et al. (2013) updated the catalogue using improved
techniques, reducing the systematic errors even further and obtaining a precision of
around 2 mas/yr. The stunning precision enabled the authors to detect the proper
motion of the Sagittarius stream, even at a distance of 30 kpc.

These accurate proper motions allowed Smith et al. to investigate halo stars out
to 5 kpc, with accuracy around 30-50 km/s for each component of the velocity. The
halo stars were identiﬁed using a reduced proper motion diagram (Fig. 7). This tech-
nique, which uses the proper motion as a proxy for distance, is often used to separate
(nearby) dwarfs from (distant) giants, but is a powerful technique to separate halo
stars from disk stars, as halo stars are faster moving and hence have higher proper

16

motions for a given distance. Although this selection is kinematically biased, it is
easy to correct for this as the cut in reduced proper motion corresponds to a cut in
tangential velocity; from a simple model one can calculate the detection efﬁciency
for stars of a given velocity without accurate distances or luminosity functions. An
additional factor which helps to separate out halo stars is that metal-poor stars are
bluer, meaning that (for a given colour) metal-poor stars are intrinsically fainter
than metal-rich ones by as much as a couple of magnitudes (see, for example, equa-
tion A2 of Ivezi´c et al. 2008; see also Bochanski et al. 2013). Once the halo stars
were identiﬁed photometrically from the reduced proper motion diagram, they were
cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy to provide metallicities and velocities. Dis-
tances were estimated by combing spectroscopic metallicities with the photometric
distance relation of Ivezi´c et al. (2008), amended slightly to include a minor correc-
tion as one approaches the turn-off region (see Appendix B of Smith et al. 2009b
and the Appendix of Smith et al. 2012). Here also the Stripe 82 data were beneﬁcial;
the multiple epochs provide much improved photometric accuracy compared to the
rest of the SDSS footprint (e.g. median (g-i) error was less than 10 mmag), enabling
much more precise photometric distances.

This halo sample was exploited for a variety of studies, including measuring the
tilt of the halo velocity ellipsoid out of the plane (Smith et al., 2009a) and inves-
tigating the global kinematics (Smith et al., 2009b). In the context of this chapter,
the sample was also important for investigating halo substructures. By working in
angular momentum space (Lz, L⊥), the sample shows clear evidence for the Helmi
stream, for the ﬁrst time detecting candidate members up to 5 kpc away (see Fig. 7).
New candidate substructures were also found, dubbed Sloan Kinematic Overdensi-
ties (SKOs). The ﬁrst one of these (SKOa) is particularly interesting - detected as
a weak overdensity of stars with high L⊥, it turned out that the feature coincides
(in angular Lz − L⊥ space) with a number of globular clusters taken from Dinescu
et al. (1999). Figure 10 of Smith et al. (2009b) shows how these four clusters (NGC
5466, NGC 6934, NGC 7089/M2 and NGC 6205/M13) lie apart from the main dis-
tribution, raising the intriguing possibility that SKOa may be either the remains of
tidal debris from one of these clusters or alternatively the remnant of a larger galaxy
which hosted a number of smaller systems (i.e. these clusters, possibly including the
progenitor of SKOa). Such hypotheses are difﬁcult to test, but a detailed abundance
analysis will be able to determine if its chemistry is consistent with any of these four
globular clusters.

The remaining two over-densities, (SKOb & c) arose from a search for distant
systems that are localised on the sky. The orientation of this ﬁeld (it is a long, thin
stripe measuring 2.5x100 deg on the sky) means that coherent streams are likely to
“cut through” this narrow stripe, and so Smith et al. (2009b) sliced the ﬁeld along
its length and searched for clumping in angular momentum space. Of the two over-
densities, the most prominent is SKOb. This has been conﬁrmed using data from
MMT (Smith et al., in prep; see Fig. 8), pinning down the distance to between 4 and
5 kpc. This structure is intriguing because, unlike most of the other halo moving
groups mentioned in this Chapter, it appears to be coherent, i.e. more like a stream
than a moving group. As it is close enough to measure proper motions, this means

Fig. 7 Analysis of kinematic overdensities in SDSS subdwarfs. The left panel shows how the sub-
dwarfs can be selected from a reduced proper motion diagram. The subdwarfs, which are located
within the dotted lines, separate from the disc sequence owing to their fainter intrinsic magnitudes
and greater velocities. The two right panels show the resulting distribution of subdwarfs in angular
momentum space, after subtraction of a smooth halo model. Note the prominent Helmi stream,
located around Jz = −1000 and J⊥ = +2000 kpc km/s. The dotted lines in these panels denote the
detection efﬁciency, which has to be considered as these stars are kinematically selected. Figure

that if we can trace an extension of this system across the sky it will become a 6D
stream, which are very rare and important for modelling the halo (e.g. Koposov
et al., 2010). As with SKOa (and, for that matter, the other overdensities found by
Klement et al. in SDSS), detailed abundances would be useful to better understand
the origins of this system. However, as SDSS photometric data extends to relatively
faint magnitudes, high resolution follow-up studies are prohibitively expensive in
terms of telescope time.

3 Distant halo streams

The above discussion of local halo streams focused on those found using three-
dimensional kinematics. However, once we move beyond the solar neighbourhood,
uncertainties in proper motion prohibit the use of tangential velocities. Tangential
errors scale linearly with distance; for example, a proper motion error of 1 mas/yr
at 1 kpc corresponds to a tangential error of 4.7 km/s, but at 10 kpc this error will
grow to 47 km/s. As a consequence, any detailed structure in phase-space is washed
out. Fortunately radial velocity uncertainties do not scale with distance and so these
can be used to probe large volumes of the halo, with the caveat that it is now harder
to interpret any identiﬁed substructures, as two components of the phase-space are
missing. Also working in our favour is that in the outer halo the mixing times are

(2009b). This ﬁgure shows the radial velocity distribution of stars with distances between 4.2 and

much longer, which allows ancient structures to remain coherent in conﬁguration
space for many Gyr.

The most spectacular and important discovery of halo substructure through ra-
dial velocities is that of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. For many years observers had
found dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, beginning with the Magellanic Clouds,
but one lay hidden behind the bulge of the Milky Way and was only discovered in
1994 (Ibata et al., 1994). This was uncovered serendipitously during a radial veloc-
ity survey of stars towards the Galactic bulge. When analysing the radial velocity
distributions in certain ﬁelds, instead of the expected Gaussian distribution, a sec-
ondary peak was identiﬁed. This peak corresponded to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,
whose systemic radial velocity is offset from the bulge by around 150 km/s. Subse-
quent works have revealed that this dwarf is in the process of being devoured by our
Galaxy, with tidal streams being discovered encircling the entire Milky Way (see
Chapter 2).

At higher latitudes other streams have been identiﬁed by their coherent radial
velocities, including the Cetus polar stream (Newberg et al., 2009), the cold metal-
poor stream of Harrigan et al. (2010) and the high-velocity stream of Frebel et al.
(2013).

One of the most impressive studies of radial-velocity selected substructures in the
halo was led by Kevin Schlaufman in the “ECHOS” series of papers (Schlaufman
et al., 2009, 2011, 2012). Their approach was to take each SDSS/SEGUE spectro-
scopic plate and determine, using robust statistics, whether the radial velocity dis-
tribution of the main-sequence stars matches what one expects for a smooth halo.
This was done using two statistical tests, as described in Section 3.2 of Schlaufman
et al. (2009) and illustrated in Fig. 9. The ﬁrst test compared the radial velocity

histogram to a similar histogram (with the same number of radial velocity measure-
ments) drawn from a smooth model halo. This realization of the smooth halo was
repeatedly resampled in order to test the signiﬁcance of any peaks in the observed
distribution. As can be seen from the upper panel of Fig 9, the grey shaded region
shows the 95 per cent conﬁdence interval from these realisations of the smooth halo
model; the fact that the observation (black histogram) and its error bar do not over-
lap the grey shaded region implies that this is a robust detection. The second test is
based on the cumulative distribution of velocities, which retains more information
than the previous approach (i.e. unlike the previous approach, it avoids any bin-
ning of the data). Again the observed distribution is compared to one drawn from a
smooth model, but this time they compare the steepness of the cumulative distribu-
tion function. This is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 9, where one can see that the
observed slope (given by the black curve) reaches into the high-signiﬁcance regions
(shown by the dark grey region).

Schlaufman et al. applied these techniques to observations of main-sequence halo
stars out to 17.5 kpc on 137 individual spectroscopic plates of SEGUE data. In these
137 lines of sight, they identiﬁed a total of 10 strong candidates (where the number
of false positive detections is estimated to be less than 1) and a further 21 weaker
candidates (estimated to have less than 3 false positives). A number of these are
likely to be detections of existing substructures, such as the Monoceros stream, but
7 of the strong candidates are new detections. Note that this does not translate to 7
new independent halo substructures, as some streams could intersect multiple lines
of sight, but it does show that the halo of the Milky Way is (at least in terms of
its kinematics) lumpy, even in the inner halo where phase mixing should occur on
relatively small time-scales. Schlaufman et al. quantify this “lumpiness,” concluding
that around 34 per cent of the inner halo is in the form of elements of cold halo
substructures (ECHOS) and estimate that there could be as many as 1e3 individual
kinematic groups in the entire inner halo.

The chemical composition of these ECHOS was investigated in the series’ second
paper (Schlaufman et al., 2011). They found that these ECHOS were more iron-rich
and less alpha-enhanced than the smooth halo, concluding that the most-likely origin
is that they were formed from the tidally disrupted debris of relatively massive dwarf
galaxies (Mtot > 1e9 M(cid:12)). In the ﬁnal paper of this series (Schlaufman et al., 2012)
the authors investigated the spatial coherence in [Fe/H] as a function of Galactocen-
tric radius, concentrating only on main sequence turnoff stars from the kinematically
smooth halo (namely SEGUE ﬁelds in which no ECHOS were detected). Although
these ﬁelds are phase mixed and show no kinematic substructures, the chemistry of
these stars can illuminate their origins. By studying the distributions of stars in the
[Fe/H]–[α/Fe] plane they found that the accreted halo becomes dominant beyond
around 15 kpc from the Galactic centre, arguing that at smaller radii the halo is
probably formed from a combination of in-situ star formation and dissipative major
mergers at high redshift.

As the careful work of Schlaufman et al. has shown, statistical studies are im-
portant if we are to dissect the halo of the Milky Way beyond the solar neighbour-
hood, especially when the sky coverage is not contiguous and the sampling of stars

with spectra is sparse. Various tools have been developed, including the 4distance
measure introduced by Starkenburg et al. (2009; see also the similar approach of
Clewley & Kinman 2006). This technique, which is based around the separation of
pairs of stars in four dimensions (angular position on the sky, distance and radial
velocity), has proved inﬂuential for subsequent works (e.g. Cooper et al., 2011; Xue
et al., 2011) and will undoubtedly continue to be used on surveys of distant halo
stars where proper motions are unavailable.

Detected Halo Streams
4 Future prospects

21

Despite extensive progress in identifying kinematic streams, the ﬁeld is far from
exhausted. On the contrary, this decade is likely to see a resurgence in this ﬁeld,
leading to unprecedented insights into the formation of our Galaxy.

From the current generation of spectroscopic surveys, we can expect signiﬁcant
progress in the coming years. In terms of sheer volume of spectra, the Chinese
LAMOST survey is unsurpassed (Deng et al., 2012). By gathering over a million
spectra each year, this spectroscopic survey has great potential. Already one new
candidate kinematic overdensity has been identiﬁed (Zhao et al., 2014) and various
works are analysing substructure in the local velocity distribution, for example the
work of Xia et al. (2015) which is utilising the extreme deconvolution technique
(Bovy Jo et al., 2011).

If we think about the accreted galaxies which built up our stellar halo, they will of
course have a range of masses and accretion times. Their chemical composition will
therefore vary since the amount of enrichment that can take place depends on these
factors (see, for example, Lee et al. 2015). As a consequence, a detailed dissection
of the accretion history of our halo will require both kinematics and chemistry. By
combining dark matter simulations with semi-analytic prescriptions for the star for-
mation and chemistry, it is possible to make predictions for what we may be able
to detect and how much we can infer about our Galaxy’s accretion history from a
given set of of kinematic and chemical abundance data (e.g. Johnston et al., 2008).
There are a number of spectroscopic surveys that operate at resolutions sufﬁ-
cient to carry out detailed chemical abundance analyses, for example the SDSS
project APOGEE (Holtzman et al., 2015), the GALAH survey (Freeman, 2012),
or the Gaia-ESO survey (Gilmore et al., 2012; Randich et al., 2013). These de-
tailed abundances opes up the possibility of “chemical tagging,” whereby abun-
dance ratios are used to disentangle the different formation sites for groups of stars
(Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn, 2002). Clearly these additional dimensions will be
extremely valuable when attempting to identify kinematic substructures in the local
disk, where groups may overlap if one looks at only the 6D phase-space. Although
this technique is ideally suited to ﬁnding moving groups in the disk, as mentioned
above chemistry will allow us to classify halo streams and understand their origins
– in effect carrying out the discovery and follow-up in one step.

As the Gaia satellite begins to deliver scientiﬁc return, there is no doubt that we
are on the cusp of a true revolution in this ﬁeld. This mission, which is led by the
European Space Agency, is collecting high precision astrometry of a billion stars in
our galaxy. All stars in the sky brighter than 20th magnitude will be observed, lead-
ing to exquisite proper motions and parallaxes. The precision is so great that it will
be able to measure distances (through trigonometric parallax) to less than 1 per cent
for ten million stars. In addition to the astrometry, Gaia will provide detailed photo-
metric information (from spectrophotometry) including stellar parameters and, for
stars brighter than around 17th magnitude, spectroscopic information including ra-
dial velocities. A description of the science capabilities can be found in de Bruijne
(2012), although continually updated performance information can be found on the

22

Gaia webpage. The ﬁnal catalogue is expected in 2022, with interim releases before
then.

Clearly such an unprecedented mapping of 6D phase space will open up an en-
tirely new view of the local velocity distribution. While we wait for the ﬁrst Gaia
data to appear, many authors have attempted to estimate what we might be able to
see. One example of this is G´omez et al. (2010), who modelled the Milky Way halo
through the accretion of satellite galaxies, then convolved these with Gaia’s observa-
tional errors. Fig. 10 shows what we may be able to detect in a solar neighbourhood
realization; there are 1e5 stellar halo particles within this sphere of 4 kpc radius, plus
around 20,000 stellar disk particles. Upon applying a detection algorithm to identify
substructure, they conﬁrm 12 separate accretion events, corresponding to around 50
per cent of all disrupted satellites in this volume. For some of these detections the
authors ﬁnd that it should be possible to directly estimate when these satellites were
accreted, exploiting the fact that disrupting satellites form separate clumps in fre-
quency space and the separation of these clumps relate to the time since accretion
(McMillan & Binney, 2008; G´omez & Helmi, 2010). This remarkable feat requires
a large enough sample of stars with accurate parallaxes (typically 50 or more stars
with parallax error less than 2 per cent), but in this realization G´omez et al. predict
that it should be attainable for at least four of their detected satellites. Being able
to determine the time of accretion, together with a detailed analysis of the chem-
istry of these stars, will undoubtedly teach us a great deal about the evolution of star
formation in these earliest galaxies.

With Gaia in mind, a number of other studies have devised methods to search
for substructures. One such work is that of Mateu et al. (2011), who utilise the fact
that (for a spherical potential) streams will fall on great circles as viewed from the
Galactic centre. This is based on an earlier study (Johnston et al., 1996), but by
extending the analysis to include data such that will be available from Gaia (i.e.
parallaxes and kinematics) the method has much greater efﬁcacy. Of course this
technique still requires streams to be conﬁned to orbital planes and, as such, is ill-
suited to the inner halo where the shorter dynamical times lead to signiﬁcant phase
mixing. However, at intermediate distances in the halo where Gaia will still be able
to provide reasonable parallaxes (with distance accuracy of say 30 per cent), this
technique will thrive.

Although Gaia will play a dominant role in the coming decades, it will not pro-
vide all of the answers. The on-board spectroscopy is limited to only the brightest
stars and will not deliver detailed chemistry, meaning that a huge ground-based
follow-up program is required. The realization that this limitation hampered the
scientiﬁc return of the Hipparcos mission, led to the Gaia-ESO survey, and also pro-
vides strong motivation for future instruments, such as Subaru’s Prime Focus Spec-
trograph (Takada et al., 2014), 4-MOST (de Jong et al., 2014), WEAVE (Dalton
et al., 2014) and the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (Simons et al., 2014).

It is fascinating to see how, 150 years since M¨adler and his contemporaries made
their ﬁrst discoveries, the analysis of kinematic substructures is still playing an im-
portant role in understanding the evolution of the Galaxy. M¨adler couldn’t have
imagined that some moving groups could be the relics of other galaxies, but to-

day these substructures are illuminating our knowledge of the earliest galaxies and
hierarchical assembly. As new surveys are undertaken, the census of substructures
becomes more complete. Perhaps in 150 years accretion events such as these will
still be contributing new insights.
