In this talk, I discuss our recent work concerning the construction of non-supersymmetric het-
erotic string models which have exponentially suppressed dilaton tadpoles and cosmological con-
stants, and thus greatly enhanced stability properties. The existence of such models opens the
door to non-supersymmetric string model-building, and I discuss how semi-realistic string mod-
els resembling the Standard Model or any of its uniﬁed variants may be constructed within this
framework. These models maintain modular invariance and exhibit a misaligned supersymmetry
which ensures UV ﬁniteness, even without spacetime supersymmetry. I also discuss the potential
implications for phenomenology.

Stable Non-SUSY Strings

Steven Abel

1. Introduction: Background, motivation, and overview

Recent data from the LHC seems to hint against the most minimal version of supersymmetry
(SUSY), and there has been much recent interest in alternatives. It therefore seems a good moment
to ask what the implications are for string phenomenology, given that SUSY is such an apparently
integral part of string theory.

Perhaps the major hurdle in constructing string models without spacetime SUSY has been that
they are generally unstable, with non-vanishing dilaton tadpoles. However, in recent work [1], we
have been able to demonstrate the existence of non-supersymmetric perturbative heterotic string
models with exponentially suppressed dilaton tadpoles. Such models are therefore virtually free
of dilaton-related stability problems, and from this standpoint are similar to their SUSY cousins.
Moreover, models within this class can even be constructed which resemble the Standard Model
or its various uniﬁed extensions. The existence of such models thus establishes a starting point for
the development of an entirely non-supersymmetric string phenomenology — a phenomenology
for possible physics beyond the Standard Model which is non-supersymmetric at any energy scale
but which nevertheless descends directly from string theory. As such, these models are UV com-
plete, with ﬁniteness ensured through entirely stringy mechanisms (such as modular invariance and
“misaligned SUSY” [2, 3, 4]) which ensure ﬁniteness even without SUSY. This talk is dedicated to
outlining the basic ideas behind these developments, with details to be found in Ref. [1].

There are many reasons why the phenomenology of such non-supersymmetric models is of
interest. Clearly the major stumbling block for phenomenology at the electro-weak scale is the
gauge hierarchy problem, namely the question of how to protect the electro-weak scale against
quantum corrections from the UV completion of the theory. There are many symmetry-based ideas
that have been explored within ﬁeld theory towards solving this problem. However it is known
that string theory provides additional symmetries — modular invariance and misaligned SUSY,
for example — that cannot be seen within an effective ﬁeld theory, except insofar as they might
lead to approximate symmetries (such as non-compact shift symmetries). Moreover, almost all
ﬁeld-theoretic explorations of this subject (barring perhaps ones based on asymptotic safety) lack
the very UV completion that one is trying to protect against. Therefore a successful explanation
within effective ﬁeld theory must be able to shield against any UV completion, regardless of its
properties. Supersymmetry is remarkable in that it protects against UV completions of any kind.
However it is important to ask if UV-complete but non-supersymmetric theories might provide
additional (perhaps subtler) answers to the hierarchy problem.

The results of Ref. [1] demonstrate that hierarchically separated scales can be natural within
the context of non-supersymmetric string theories. Note that we when refer to non-supersymmetric
string theories, we do not mean theories that have spacetime SUSY at the Planck scale, with the
SUSY broken in the low-energy ﬁeld theory via purely ﬁeld-theoretic mechanisms such as, for ex-
ample, gaugino condensation. Rather, we are referring to theories which are non-supersymmetric
at all scales, including their fundamental Planck scales. In such models, whatever supersymme-
try might have otherwise existed has been destroyed through purely string-theoretic steps in the
primordial model-construction process, such as through particular choices of SUSY-breaking com-
pactiﬁcations from ten dimensions that nevertheless respect modular invariance. Such compactiﬁ-
cations are often generalised versions of Scherk-Schwarz compactiﬁcation, and with a slight abuse

of terminology one often speaks of breaking the SUSY “spontaneously” via such compactiﬁca-
tions. The important point, however, is that only these purely string-theoretic construction methods
ensure that the resulting string theory remains UV-ﬁnite with or without supersymmetry. It is mod-
ular invariance which ensures that the fundamental domain for the one-loop integral avoids those
regions corresponding to the UV divergences of ﬁeld theory. More physically, at the level of the
string spectrum, this ﬁniteness is ensured through a hidden so-called “misaligned supersymme-
try” [2, 3, 4] that always remains in the spectrum of any self-consistent string theory, even if super-
symmetry itself is absent. This misaligned SUSY corresponds to a subtle conﬁguration of bosonic
and fermionic states throughout the string spectrum in which no boson/fermion pairing exists, either
exact or approximate, but which nevertheless conspires to produce ﬁnite amplitudes. Given this,
the major accomplishment described in Ref. [1] has been to demonstrate that this UV-ﬁniteness can
be realized within the context of string models which are phenomenologically semi-realistic and
which can tolerate the large separations of scales that are needed for phenomenological purposes.
The ﬁrst step in the hunt for such models is to tackle the issue of dilaton stability. It turns
out that to one-loop order, the problem of dilaton stability is related to the problem of the cos-
mological constant, as sketched in Fig. 1. This is encouraging, since in any non-supersymmetric
string theory the cosmological constant is the ﬁrst quantity that one would like to make hierarchi-
cally smaller than its generic value. Thus, only those special theories in which the cosmological
constant vanishes to leading order have a chance of being consistently stabilised.

. (b) The one-loop one-point dilaton
“tadpole” diagram. In general, the value of the dilaton tadpole is always proportional to L
. As a result, a
non-zero cosmological constant implies a non-vanishing one-loop dilaton tadpole diagram, in turn indicating
a linear term ∼ f
in the effective potential. This ﬁgure, like all ﬁgures in this talk, is adapted from Ref. [1].

The string models in constructed in Ref. [1] have this property as well. Speciﬁcally, the models
in Ref. [1] have exponentially suppressed one-loop cosmological constants. Their dilatons are thus
essentially stable, at least to one-loop order. It is for this reason that these models represent suitable
platforms upon which to build a study of non-supersymmetric string phenomenology.

The rest of this talk will be devoted to a discussion of these models and their properties.
However, I should mention the many other works that have also considered non-supersymmetric
string theories, beginning with the works that originally adapted the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism
to string theory. These include the original studies of the ten-dimensional SO(16)× SO(16) het-
erotic string [5], studies of the one-loop cosmological constants of non-supersymmetric strings [6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], their their ﬁniteness properties [2, 3, 19], and
their strong/weak coupling duality symmetries [20, 21, 22, 23]. There have even been studies of
the landscapes of such strings [24, 25]. All studies of strings at ﬁnite temperature are also im-

plicitly studies of non-supersymmetric strings (for early work in this area, see, e.g., Refs. [26, 27,
28, 29, 30]). In general, the non-supersymmetric string models which were studied were either
non-supersymmetric by construction or exhibited the same kind of spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking that forms the basis of our work [6, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], achieved through
a stringy version of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism [39] — indeed, potentially viable models
within this class were constructed in Refs. [40, 41, 42, 7, 43, 44, 23, 45, 46]. Non-supersymmetric
string models have also been explored in a wide variety of other conﬁgurations [47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60], including studies of the relations between scales in various
schemes [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67].

2. The general framework

2.1 Scherk-Schwarz compactiﬁcation: General properties

The string models of Ref. [1] are constructed through supersymmetry-breaking Scherk-Schwarz
compactiﬁcations from higher dimensions. As such, they therefore share certain properties which
are common to all models in which spacetime supersymmetry is broken in this manner.

As mentioned, models in this class are said to have “spontaneously broken supersymmetry”:
they have, for example, an identiﬁable order parameter for the breaking, namely the compactiﬁ-
cation scale, which we shall refer to generically as 1/R where R is the compactiﬁcation radius.
(In general, this scale will of course depend on all the moduli that describe the compactiﬁcation
manifold; however this simpliﬁcation will be sufﬁcient for our purposes.) Likewise, the cosmologi-
cal constant (which is essentially the vacuum energy density or Casimir energy density) generically
goes like 1/R4. Similarly, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are typically split non-supersymmetrically
with a splitting scale 1/2R. This, for example, is the mass of the gravitino in any of the theories we
construct.

These properties notwithstanding, it is important to emphasise from the outset that the spec-
trum of the resulting theory is truly non-supersymmetric at all energy scales. In particular, there is
no scale beyond which the spectrum appears to be effectively supersymmetric. The winding modes
of the theory have masses proportional to R and so experience gross shifts in their masses which
only increase with R. The same is true at small radius, with winding modes and KK modes inter-
changed, and in the R → 0 limit such theories typically remain non-supersymmetric but become
effectively higher-dimensional, just as they do for R → ¥
. Therefore, the distinction between su-
persymmetric and non-supersymmetric string theories is not merely a question of the energy scale
at which supersymmetry is broken, and as discussed more fully in Ref. [1] it would be wrong to
view non-supersymmetric string models as having been supersymmetric at high energy scales but
subsequently subjected to some sort of SUSY-breaking mechanism at lower energies. That the en-
tirely supersymmetric theory reached at large R is an extra-dimensional one is another indication
of this fact: the gravitino and gaugino masses are the same order as the KK masses, so there is no
scale at which 4D broken supersymmetry provides a good description of the phenomenology.

That said, it does make sense, at least partially, to speak of an effective spontaneously broken
supersymmetric ﬁeld theory, at the lowest orders of perturbation theory. The heavy string modes
provide a threshold contribution to the effective ﬁeld theory which, thanks to the miracle of UV

4

completion, is indeed ﬁnite and well behaved. Indeed, as discussed more fully in Ref. [1], these
properties persist — even without supersymmetry — as the result of a hidden “misaligned super-
symmetry” which neverthless remains in the spectrum of any tachyon-free, non-supersymmetric
closed string model.

The nett result, then, is a theory in which the supersymmetry-breaking terms can be dialed
to any value, even to the string scale itself, with non-supersymmetric threshold effects (such as,
e.g., violations of the non-renormalisation theorem and hard supersymmetry-breaking operators)
becoming more pronounced as the supersymmetry-breaking approaches the string scale. In this
way the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism allows us to parametrically deform the theory away from
one with a supersymmetric content towards an entirely non-supersymmetric one. This property of
interpolation is an integral and important feature of our construction.

2.2 The importance of interpolation: Proto-gravitons and their contributions to L

In order to understand the importance of this interpolation property, let us consider the various
contributions to radiative corrections. In general there can be many different kinds of physical and
unphysical states which contribute to the one-loop partition function,

Z(t ) = t 2

1−D/2(cid:229)

amn qmqn ,

m,n

(2.1)

where q = e2p it
in the usual nome, t 1 ≡ Ret , t 2 ≡ Imt , and anm counts the number of bosons
minus fermions with right- and left-moving worldsheet energies (HR,HL) = (m,n). Level-matched
states with m = n are physical, while those with m 6= n are “unphysical” and contribute only inside
loops. However, every non-supersymmetric string model necessarily contains off-shell tachyonic
states with (m,n) = (0,−1), leading to a0,−1 6= 0. This is a theorem [11] which holds regardless of
the speciﬁc class of non-supersymmetric string model under study and regardless of the particular
GSO projections that might be imposed.

It is easy to understand the origin of these states and their effect on the partition function. We
know that every string model contains a completely NS/NS sector from which the gravity multiplet
arises:

graviton ⊂ ˜y

(2.2)
Here |0iR,L are the right- and left-moving vacua of the heterotic string, ˜y
−1/2 represents the excita-
m , and a
n
tion of the right-moving world-sheet Neveu-Schwarz fermion ˜y
−1 represents the excitation
of the left-moving coordinate boson X n . Indeed, no self-consistent GSO projection can possibly
eliminate this gravity multiplet from the string spectrum. However, given that the graviton is al-
ways in the string spectrum, then there must also exist in the string spectrum a corresponding state
for which the left-moving coordinate oscillator is not excited:

m

m

−1/2|0iR ⊗ a

n
−1|0iL .

proto-graviton:

˜y

m

−1/2|0iR ⊗ |0iL .

(2.3)

This “proto-graviton” state has world-sheet energies (ER,EL) = (m,n) = (0,−1), and is thus off-
shell and tachyonic. Nevertheless, it is always there in the string spectrum along with the graviton.
Normally one ignores such things in phenomenology, ﬁrstly because they cannot appear as
asymptotic states in any scattering (hence they are referred to as “unphysical” which we consider

5

to be something of a misnomer), and secondly because, in a supersymmetric theory, any con-
tribution to the partition function from the proto-graviton is automatically cancelled by an equal
and opposite one from its superpartner, the proto-gravitino. In the context of non-supersymmetric
strings, however, the latter is absent (or lifted to the SUSY-breaking scale). Thus we can quite
generally write the ﬁrst term in the q-expansion of any non-SUSY string theory. As evident from
Eq. (2.3), the proto-graviton states transform as vectors under the transverse spacetime Lorentz
symmetry SO(D− 2). Thus, any non-supersymmetric string theory in D uncompactiﬁed spacetime
dimensions must have a partition function which begins with the contribution

Z(t ) =

D− 2
q

+ ...

(2.4)

One may also easily evaluate the contributions that the various states make to the cosmological
constant. These are given by

(D) ≡ − 1

M DZF

d2t
t 2

2 Z(t )

where M is the reduced string scale and

F ≡ {t : |Ret | ≤ 1

2 , Imt > 0, |t | ≥ 1}

(2.5)

(2.6)

is the fundamental domain of the modular group.

As a toy example, and also to illustrate the general structure of interpolating models, consider
a D = 10 theory compactiﬁed on a twisted circle. Any such (D − 1)-dimensional model has a
partition function that takes the general form [6, 26, 27, 28, 29]

Zstring(t ,R) = Z(1)(t ) E0(t ,R) + Z(2)(t ) E1/2(t ,R)

+ Z(3)(t ) O0(t ,R) + Z(4)(t ) O1/2(t ,R)

(2.7)

where the E0,1/2 and O0,1/2 functions indicate various restricted summations over KK and winding
modes, as described in Sect. III.B of Ref. [1]. The models are considered to be “interpolating”
between two different ten-dimensional models M1 and M2 as R → ¥
and R → 0, respectively,
with Z(1) + Z(2) reproducing the partition function of M1 and Z(1) + Z(3) reproducing the partition
function M2. In this talk we shall be concerned with situations in which M1 has spacetime super-
symmetry but M2 does not. Thus Z(2) = −Z(1), so that there are only three different sectors making
non-supersymmetric contributions to the cosmological constant: E0 − E1/2, O0, and O1/2.
The bose-fermi non-degeneracies (i.e., the values of ann as a function of n) are shown in
Fig. 2 for a speciﬁc model in this class, for different values of the dimensionless inverse radius
a ≡ √a
′/R. This spectral information clearly illustrates the non-softness of the supersymmetry
breaking in such models, namely the fact that no matter how much one might attempt to “re-
store” the supersymmetry by increasing the radius √a
′/R = a → 0, the spectrum remains non-
supersymmetric with amn 6= 0 for all (m,n) as long as R remains ﬁnite. Despite this feature, for
large but ﬁnite R the low-lying spectrum resembles that of a broken-SUSY higher-dimensional
theory (with towers of KK modes and their slightly displaced would-be superpartners), while the
intermediate and heavy spectra are more violently non-supersymmetric and thereby produce im-
portant non-supersymmetric threshold effects.

Figure 2: Degeneracies of physical states for a particular 9D interpolating model described in Ref. [1].
Results are shown for a = 1 (upper left), a = 0.33 (upper right), a = 0.25 (lower left), a = 0.125 (lower
′/R. Within each plot, points are connected in order of increasing world-sheet energy n.
In all cases we see that surpluses of bosonic states alternate with surpluses of fermionic states as we proceed
upwards in n; this behavior is the signal of an underlying “misaligned supersymmetry” [2, 3, 4] which
exists within all modular-invariant non-supersymmetric tachyon-free string theories and which is ultimately
responsible for the ﬁniteness of closed strings — even in the absence of spacetime supersymmetry. For
R = √a
′ (or a = 1), we see that this oscillation between bosonic and fermionic surpluses occurs within the
exponentially growing envelope function |ann| ∼ ec√n associated with a Hagedorn transition. However, as
the compactiﬁcation radius increases (or equivalently as a → 0), we see that a hierarchy begins to emerge
between the oscillator states and their KK excitations; the oscillator states continue to experience densities of
states which are exponentially growing as functions of n, but their corresponding KK excitations are densely
packed within each interval (n,n + 1) and, as expected, exhibit constant state degeneracies.

Within such interpolating models, the contributions to the cosmological constant in the √a

′/R =
a → 0 limit from a given state with world-sheet energies (m,n) in the different E /O-sectors are
found [1] to be as follows:

In this table, D represents the dimensionality of the theory in question prior to the compactiﬁcation
on the twisted circle. At large radii, the leading contribution to the cosmological constant is given
by the nett contribution coming from the massless m = n = 0 physical states. As evident from

thereby recovering the same contribution to the Casimir energy that one would infer in a higher-
dimensional ﬁeld theory. Quite remarkably, however, we see from Table 2.8 that all other con-
tributions to the cosmological constant are exponentially suppressed! Thus, if we can construct
models for which N(0)
, we will have succeeded in constructing string models for which the
cosmological constant is exponentially suppressed.

b = N(0)

b = N(0)

We emphasize that having N(0)

is only a statement about massless states. Moreover,
this requirement does not require an actual supersymmetry, even at the massless level; all that is
required are equal numbers of massless bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Finally, not all
of these degrees of freedom are required to exist in a visible sector — some may carry quantum
numbers that correspond to visible-sector states, while others may carry quantum numbers that
place them in a hidden sector. Neither sector by itself needs to exhibit N(0)
as long as both
sectors together combine to maintain this relation. The generic structure of the low-lying spectrum
for such models is illustrated in Fig. 3.

b = N(0)

It is important to note that when N(0)

, the one-loop cosmological constant is exponen-
tially suppressed even when the contributions from the unphysical states are included. Note that
the contribution from such states is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions D. One
can understand this from the fact that D-dependence requires states to be able to propagate long
distances and thereby “feel” the full spacetime — something which unphysical states are not able
to do. Nevertheless these states still contribute to the cosmological constant because the bottom of
the fundamental domain (i.e., the UV end of the one-loop integral) is curved. Indeed, as noted in
Ref. [1], the contribution from the proto-graviton states with (m,n) = (0,−1) exceeds that of even
∼ 0.54. Thus such interpolating models with R <
the massless (0,0) physical contributions for a <
∼ 2
have little chance of being stable.
All of these observations render the cleanest assumptions about the compactiﬁcation scale
(namely that Mc ≡ 1/R ≈ Mstring) problematic. Indeed, in such models it is not always clear how
to separate oscillator states from KK states and/or winding states; there even exist examples of
such models which transcend the notion of having a compactiﬁcation geometry altogether and
in which no compactiﬁcation geometry can be identiﬁed. For such models we typically obtain

a cosmological constant of order L ∼ Mstring. Of course, even within such string models, there
remains the possibility that L might still vanish through some other mechanism. For example, the
proposals in Refs. [10, 11, 13] all rely on different kinds of symmetry arguments for cancelling L
within closed string models for which Mc ∼ Mstring. Unfortunately, no string models have ever been
constructed exhibiting the symmetries proposed in Refs. [10, 11], and the mechanism proposed in
Ref. [13] may actually fail at higher loops [15, 16].

Figure 3: The structure of the spectrum of a generic interpolating model with suppressed cosmological
constant in the limit of large interpolating radius. States with masses below Mstring (or below n = 1) consist of
massless observable states, massless hidden-sector states, their would-be superpartners, and their lightest KK
excitations. For these lightest states, the nett (bosonic minus fermionic) numbers of degrees of freedom from
the hidden sector are exactly equal and opposite to those from the observable sector for all large radii. Note
that this cancellation of nett physical-state degeneracies between the observable and hidden sectors bears
no connection with any supersymmetry, either exact or approximate, in the string spectrum. Nevertheless,
it is this conspiracy between the observable and hidden sectors which suppresses the overall cosmological
constant and enhances the stability of these strings. For the heavier states, by contrast, the observable and
hidden sectors need no longer supply equal and opposite numbers of degrees of freedom. Nevertheless the
entire theory remains ﬁnite at one-loop order through the misaligned supersymmetry [2, 3, 4] illustrated in
Fig. 2.

The alternative possibility that we are proposing is to consider models in which Mstring is ﬁxed
but Mc is taken to be a free, adjustable variable. Indeed, we can go even further and imagine that
our compactiﬁcation volume is characterized by many different compactiﬁcation scales M(i)
c , each
of which we might consider a free parameter; such a scenario would emerge, for example, if our
d-dimensional compactiﬁcation manifold is a d-torus with different radii of compactiﬁcation Ri,
i = 1, ...,d. In general, as the volume of compactiﬁcation Vd is taken to inﬁnity, we effectively
produce a string model in d additional spacetime dimensions. This higher-dimensional model is
the general equivalent of our M1 above. For closed strings, T-duality then ensures that we also
produce a model in d additional spacetime dimensions as Vd → 0, which is the equivalent of M2.
The model with variable compactiﬁcation volumes can thus be said to interpolate between the two
higher-dimensional endpoint models, M1 and M2, in the same manner as the interpolation between
the two ten-dimensional models above.

Such interpolating models offer a number of distinct advantages when it comes to suppressing
the cosmological constant. Since the model M1 is supersymmetric in our construction, we are
assured that L = 0 when Vd → ¥
. Moreover, since M2 is non-supersymmetric, the spacetime
supersymmetry is broken for all ﬁnite Vd. It is therefore reasonable to assume that we can dial Vd to

9

Stable Non-SUSY Strings

a sufﬁciently large value in order to obtain a cosmological constant of whatever size we wish. Even
more compellingly, however, there is a widespread belief that spacetime supersymmetry, if it exists
at all in nature, is broken at the TeV-scale, with superpartners having masses ∼ O(TeV). Indeed,
as ﬁrst suggested in Refs. [6, 62], these sorts of scenarios with large compactiﬁcation volumes
are relatively easy to incorporate with the interpolating-model framework with Mc ∼ O(TeV). Of
course, there is absolutely no reason within our construction why this value for the radius should
be chosen.

Perhaps even more importantly, we also note that within this construction, the scale of the cos-
mological constant is no longer tied to the effective scale of the supersymmetry breaking. In par-
ticular, although we can consider the scale of supersymmetry breaking in these models to be given
by Mc = 1/R, for models with N(0)
the cosmological constant is exponentially suppressed,
scaling as O(e−4p Mstring/Mc ). This allows Mc to be even larger than O(TeV) without destroying the
all-important stablity of these theories. This additional stability is a precursor of what one might
eventually hope to achieve for scalar masses.

3. Semi-realistic interpolating string models with exponentially small cosmological

constant

3.1 Outline of construction technique

We now outline the construction of our stable semi-realistic non-supersymmetric string mod-
els. For technical reasons it is advantageous to interpolate between M1 and M2 models in six dimen-
sions rather than ﬁve. We therefore begin with six-dimensional models M1 that have N = 1 super-
symmetry. Such models are most conveniently obtained by lifting to six dimensions semi-realistic
four-dimensional N = 1 string models, for example those in Refs. [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]
which are already on the market. Our objective is to retain as far as possible their desirable phe-
nomenological features.

Once we have constructed such suitable models M1, the next step is to compactify back down
to four dimensions. The four-dimensional N = 1 model that results from compactifying back to
four dimensions on a T2/ZZ2 orbifold can be compared with the four-dimensional N = 0 model
that results from a coordinate-dependent compactiﬁcation (CDC) on the same orbifold using the
techniques of Refs. [31, 32, 33].

f

Our ﬁnal step is to take the resulting N = 0 model and introduce modiﬁcations to obtain
b = N(0)
N(0)
, as required to produce exponentially suppressed cosmological constant. There are
several different ways in which this can be done. One way is to alter the ﬁnal Scherk-Schwarz
(CDC) twist but retain the prior GSO symmetry breaking:
this can produce an SM-like model.
By contrast, altering the ﬁnal twist and also removing prior GSO projections can lead to a variety
of additional models: a Pati-Salam-like model, a ﬂipped-SU (5) “uniﬁed” model, and an SO(10)
“uniﬁed” model, each also with N(0)
. The procedure is outlined in Fig. 4. Undoubtedly
these models are only several within an entire new terrain which deserves exploration.

where the Pati-Salam group corresponding to the visible sector is indicated. This model, which has
four quasi-supersymmetric chiral generations of massless untwisted matter but no twisted matter,
has N(0)
f = 416 complex massless degrees of freedom in the untwisted sector. The spectrum
is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Many similar examples can be found.

b = N(0)

4. Phenomenological properties

4.1 Spectrum

The phenomenological structure of models such as those discussed above is very general. First,
for large compactiﬁcation radii, the spectrum itself is arranged according to the characteristic form
sketched in Fig. 3, with visible and hidden sectors together conspiring to produce N(0)
b = N(0)
.
This boson/fermion degeneracy holds only for the low-lying states, however, and disappears at
higher mass levels. This structure is also apparent in the plots of nett bose-fermi number in Fig. 5,
which illustrate the “misaligned-supersymmetry” properties of the above Pati-Salam model for a
variety of different compactiﬁcation radii. Indeed, as the compactiﬁcation radius increases beyond
a certain critical value, we see from Fig. 5 that the entire KK spectrum begins to exhibit a bose-
fermi degeneracy below the string scale — all this despite the fact that the theory is completely
non-supersymmetric at all mass levels and energy scales.

4.2 Cosmological constant

It is also interesting to examine the cosmological constant L (a) of the Pati-Salam model as a
function of the inverse radius a = √a
′/R. Our results are shown in Fig. 6, and are consistent with
the gross features that one would expect from the above discussion: the cosmological constant is
ﬁnite for all radii, exponentially suppressed in the large-radius limit, and radius-independent in the
small-radius limit. This last observation suggests the existence of a zero-radius endpoint model
(a.k.a. M2) with an entirely non-supersymmetric but tachyon-free spectrum — one which most
likely corresponds to a 6D fermionic string constructed with discrete torsion. More surprisingly,
however, just above (but not at) the self-dual radius, we ﬁnd a stable anti-de Sitter minimum. This
turn-over could indicate a restoration of gauge symmetry and/or supersymmetry, and is similar to
the situation encountered in the Type II models of Ref. [38].

4.3 Scalar masses

Finally let us turn to the stringy threshold corrections that generate scalar masses, etc. These
are all in principle calculable. Indeed, at one-loop order, their chief contribution at large radius can
be understood by a ﬁeld-theoretic calculation as it is dominated by the physical modes propagating
in the loops. The string-theoretic calculation of these effects can be carried out in a fashion analo-
gous to the usual gauge beta-function calculation — namely by directly determining the two-point
function for the scalar, but with the appropriate Scherk-Schwarz modiﬁed partition function. As
one might expect, the result no longer vanishes, and the amplitude can be written as

Figure 5: Degeneracies of physical states for the Pati-Salam model with exponentially suppressed cosmo-
logical constant. The inverse radius a = √a
′/R varies from a = 3 (upper left) to a = 0.1 (lower right).
Comparing with Fig. 2, we see that all of the general features associated with interpolating models survive,
including a smoothly growing exponential envelope function for a ∼ O(1) which slowly deforms into a dis-
cretely step-wise growing exponential function as a → 0. This reﬂects the emerging hierarchy between KK
states and oscillator states. However, we also observe a critical new feature which reﬂects the fact that this
model has an exponentially suppressed cosmological constant: the removal or “evacuation” of all non-zero
nett state degeneracies ann for n ≤ 1 for sufﬁciently small a. Thus, for sufﬁciently large radius, the spectrum
of such models develops an exact boson/fermion degeneracy for all relevant mass levels n < 1, even though
there is no supersymmetry anywhere in the spectrum. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 3, this degeneracy does
not occur through a pairing of states with their would-be superpartners, but rather as the result of the bal-
ancing of non-zero nett degeneracies associated with a non-supersymmetric observable sector against the
degeneracies associated with a non-supersymmetric hidden sector.

We can split the contributions into those from massless physical states and those from massive
ones. The term (4pt
2)−1 will be proportional to the overall cosmological constant and is there-
fore exponentially suppressed. The contribution from the massless-sector terms to the canonically

′/R. For large
limit of this model is non-supersymmetric
and tachyon-free. We also see that the entire curve is ﬁnite, which indicates that no tachyons emerge at any
intermediate radii. Thus this model lacks Hagedorn-like instabilities. However we observe that the small-a
behaviour of this curve is radically different from the generic case. First, we see that L does not have the
usual Casimir a4 behaviour, but rather is exponentially suppressed. Second, and somewhat surprisingly, we
observe that L
changes sign as a → 0 increases past unity. Indeed, we see that the cosmological constant
appears to have a stable minimum near (but not precisely at) the self-dual radius, and moreover that the
cosmological constant crosses zero at yet another (slightly higher) radius. It is not clear whether there might
exist enhanced symmetry at either of these speciﬁc radii.

The ﬁrst of these expressions does not necessarily vanish even if its analogue does for the cosmo-
logical constant, because the Higgs couples differently to the states that are projected out by the
CDC. Note, however, the interesting possibility of exponentially suppressed Higgs masses as well.

4.4 Final comment

Steven Abel

To conclude I should comment on several interesting recent developments concerning the
question of large-volume “decompactiﬁcation” in Refs. [90, 91, 92, 93, 94]. The decompactiﬁ-
cation problem (i.e., reaching large volumes while avoiding large gauge couplings) has also been
discussed in the past literature in a somewhat different guise [95]. In the context of Scherk-Schwarz
breaking of supersymmetry, this is to a certain extent a dimensional transmutation of the hierarchy
problem. At ﬁrst glance, achieving order-one couplings in a generic theory appears to require
a ﬁne-tuning of one-loop corrections against tree-level ones. However, there are mechanisms to
overcome this ﬁne-tuning problem that will be presented in forthcoming work [96], some of which
utilize ideas in Ref. [95] and particularly in Ref. [97]. Moreover, one of the strong beneﬁts of the
models constructed in Ref. [1], which have been the focus of this talk, is that they naturally gen-
erate exponentially suppressed scales, so that extremely large volumes may not even be required.
This will be discussed further in Ref. [96]. Clearly a primary objective would then be to extend
exponential suppression to the Higgs mass itself. This will be explored in Ref. [98].
