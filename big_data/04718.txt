1 Introduction

The discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV at the LHC [1, 2] has enhanced
the physics case for the construction of the International Linear Collider (ILC) [3] since
this new machine will allow measuring the properties of the new particle with a precision
unreachable at the LHC. The most crucial properties to measure are the couplings to
other particles since many Beyond Standard Model scenarios predict small variations, of
the order of few percent, with respect to the Standard Model. Hence a high precision
is required to discriminate between models. Although it is relatively easy to measure
the couplings to third generation particles and to bosons, due to their large mass and
therefore coupling, it is very diﬃcult to measure coupling to second generation particles.
The analysis we describe aims at ﬁlling this gap by measuring the coupling of the Higgs
boson to the muons. The presence of the two muons from the Higgs decay in signal events
makes this channel an ideal benchmark for measuring the performance of the tracking
system of the International Large Detector (ILD) [4].
We focussed on the analysis of the νe ¯νeH, H → µ+µ− channel at centre mass energy
of 1 TeV. At this energy the WW-fusion process (Fig 1a) has a larger cross section than
the Higgsstrahlung (Fig 1b), so much that the latter can be neglected. We assumed an
integrated luminosity of 500 f b−1 and polarised beams (Pe−, Pe+) = (−0.8, +0.2). We
considered the ﬁnale states with νe ¯νeµ+µ−, where the two muons were not from an Higgs
decay, as the main background processes. We developed a new analysis starting from the
one published for the Detector Baseline Document (DBD) [5].

2 Software and Monte Carlo Samples

We used the Monte Carlo samples produced by the ILD detector optimisation group for
the DBD. The event generation was performed using WHIZARD v1.95 [6, 7]. PYTHIA [8]
was used for the modelling the fragmentation while the decays of τ leptons were handled
by TAUOLA [9]. The simulation of the ILD detector was carried out with GEANT4 [10].
The event reconstruction was performed using ILCSOFT v01-16 [11] framework while
the analysis used ROOT v5.34.25 [12] and the TMVA [13].
Given the small branching ratio of the Higgs to muon, a dedicated production was gen-
erated forcing the Higgs to decay only to muons in the channel, νe ¯νeH, H → νe ¯νeµ+µ−.
For the backgrounds we only considered those channels that were found to be signiﬁcant
in [5]: νe ¯νeZ → νe ¯νel+l−, the single boson Z leptonic decay, W W/ZZ → νl ¯νll+l−, double
boson W or Z leptonic decay, W W → νµl+ ¯ντ l−, WW scattering, γγ → νe ¯νel+l−, the
machine background. The processes are summarised in Fig 2 with their respective cross
sections.

3 Muons identiﬁcation strategies

The core of the analysis is the identiﬁcation of the two muons coming from the Higgs
boson decay. Since the publication of the DBD, the ILC community improved the par-

them are in common in the two methods.

ticles identiﬁcation which allowed us to use new strategies. We compared three methods
to identify a particle as a muon produced by a Higgs decay. The ﬁrst method is used as
a baseline and is identical to the one used in the DBD [5], this is a simple cut selection
based only on calorimeter information; the second method is an improvement of the ﬁrst
selection method as it also uses the muon tracker; ﬁnally, the third method is based
on a Neural Network as implemented in the Isolated Lepton Tagging Processor (July
version) [14].

The requests to identify a muon for both ﬁrst and second method, are summarised in

Fig 3. For each muon selection method, the following analysis was performed.

4 Analysis strategy

In addition to the requirement of identifying two muons as described above, a series
of cuts was implemented to reject many backgrounds. These cuts are similar to those
described in [5] to allow a direct comparison of the results.

• A cut on the invariant mass of the two muons: |Mll − 125| < 30 GeV.
• A cut on the angle between muons θll > 0.5 rad. The angle distribution is shown in
Fig 4a; it is clear that only background events have an angle smaller than 0.5 rad.
• A cut on the missing energy Emiss > 300 GeV. This quantity is expected to be

larger for signal events than for most background as shown in Fig 4b.

• A cut on the number of charged particles (<4) and on the number of charged

leptons (<3), as no additional charged particles are expected in signal events.

The table shown in Fig 5 shows the number of events passing each cut for every channel.
The ﬁnal column shows the number of selected events normalised to 500 f b−1. A similar
table was produced for each muon identiﬁcation strategy; for simplicity only the second
selection is shown, with the other selections being very similar.

muon identiﬁcation method.

Using these cuts we calculated the signiﬁcance σ, deﬁned as

S√
S + B

where S is the number of signal events and B is the number of background events.
Without further cuts or optimisations the signiﬁcance is σ ≈ 0.54. This poor result is
expected since, at this stage, we have not yet used the strongest discriminating variable,
the Higgs invariant mass. It is worth highlighting the large number of simulated events
that pass the selection as shown in the second column from the right in Fig 5. Because
of this high statistics it was possible to perform a multivariate analysis.

5 Multivariate Analysis

For each muon identiﬁcation methods we compared two multivariate methods imple-
mented in the TMVA. We focussed on the Fisher and the Artiﬁcial Neural Network
(ANN) methods. The variables used as inputs were:

• the angle between muons;

sum of all background events.

• the leading muon energy;
• the subleading muon energy;
• the missing energy;
• the di-muon system energy;
• the leading muon cosθ, where θ is the angle between muon and the beam line;
• the subleading muon cosθ;
• the di-muon system invariant mass;

As shown in Figure 7, a better separation was achieved for the ANN method in com-

parison to the Fisher method.

6 Results

Each muon identiﬁcation method was trained using the full amount of selected events by
that strategy to avoid any bias. The results for the second muon identiﬁcation method
are summarised in Fig 8. The main result is shown in Fig 8b. The signiﬁcance for this
selection is σ ≈ 2.75. This is a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the σ ≈ 2.3
achieved in [5].

The signiﬁcances obtained for the three muon selection strategies are shown in the
table of Fig 9. TMVA applied to the selection used in [5] improved the sensitivity from
2.3 to 2.57. The better muon selection provided by the second method, combined with
the neural network, allowed to reach a sensitivity of 2.75.

We also performed a study on the value of the cut on the mass window of the invariant
of the two muons. Reducing the allowed window also reduces the sensitivity for the
neural network. This is due to the reduced statistics for both signal and background
which limits the training capabilities of the ANN. The results of the study are shown in
the table of Fig 10.

7 Conclusion
We performed the analysis of the H → µ+µ− channel at 1 TeV using the most recent
samples from the ILD detector. By using MultiVariate techniques we increased the
signiﬁcance with respect to the DBD result from σ ≈ 2.3 to σ ≈ 2.57. Combining
the neural network selection with the latest lepton reconstruction, the signiﬁcance was
further improved to σ ≈ 2.7.

It is worth pointing out that this analysis can be further improved using the latest
available Lepton Isolation Tagger which also allows the recovery of photons emitted by
the muons. Further improvements to the MVA can also be implemented and we hope to
include them in the near future.

Finally we would like to stress the fact that this is not the only centre of mass at

which the H → µ+µ− process can be studied, hence the ultimate precision of ILD to this
process is expected to be higher.
