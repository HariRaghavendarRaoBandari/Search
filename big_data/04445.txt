We study the instability of the superconducting state in a mesoscopic geometry for the low
pinning material Mo3Ge characterized by a large Ginzburg-Landau parameter. We observe that in
the current driven switching to the normal state from a nonlinear region of the Abrikosov ﬂux ﬂow,
the mean critical vortex velocity reaches a limiting maximum velocity as a function of the applied
magnetic ﬁeld. Based on time dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations we argue that the observed
behavior is due to the high velocity vortex dynamics conﬁned on a mesoscopic scale. We build up
a general phase diagram which includes all possible dynamic conﬁgurations of Abrikosov lattice in
a mesoscopic superconductor.

INTRODUCTION

Continuos advancements in nanofabrication have per-
mitted exploration and discovery new emergent physical
phenomena when approaching the meso- and nanoscopic
limit.1–4 The stability of the superconducting state un-
der geometrical conﬁnement is now intensively investi-
gated due in part to anomalous mixed state in type-II
superconductors,5,6 as well as for reaching a better per-
formance in their potential applications.7 Unfortunately,
one rarely witnesses the persistence of the non-dissipative
regime up to the depairing current density Jdp, due
to the current induced motion of magnetic ﬂux quan-
tum units (Abrikosov vortices) and the consequent Joule
heating for currents above a critical current Jc < Jdp.
The actual discrepancy between the theoretical expec-
tation and the experimental fact has its origin in the
largely neglected non-equilibrium phenomena occurring
at the core of swiftly moving Abrikosov vortices.8,9 One
of these eﬀects, taking place at intermediate current den-
sities Jc < J∗ < Jdp, consists of a deformation of the
ﬂux quanta core due to the slow healing time of the
superconducting condensate after the passage of a vor-
tex singularity in the condensate.10 As a consequence,
a rapid moving vortex leaves behind a trail of depleted
order parameter which further facilitates the motion of
other vortices thus forming rivers of ﬂux leading to a net
increase of dissipation and triggering an abrupt transi-
tion from the Abrikosov ﬂux ﬂow regime to the normal
state.11,12 No matter which mechanism is responsible for
this current instability,10–15 in this work we show that
in the mesoscopic regime, the average critical velocity
needed to trigger the instabilities is limited by a max-
imum speed value, that is not observed under no con-
ﬁnement. We investigate the so far totally unexplored
mesoscopic regime where the scenario based on pinning
disorder is of no application due to the fact that we

use an extremely weak pinning superconducting mate-
rial, Mo3Ge, in which free ﬂux ﬂow has been recently
conﬁrmed.16 Many studies have been carried out in order
to address other possible competing eﬀects such as the in-
ﬂuence of pinning properties of the intrinsic material17,18
and the artiﬁcially structured superconductors.19 Never-
thelss, in all these cases the geometry of the test sample
has been kept on a macroscopic scale. Here we demon-
strate that the Abrikosov lattice instability is aﬀected
by a signiﬁcant surface barrier in mesoscopic supercon-
ductors. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations
satisfactory reproduce the experimental results and give
a complete overall description of Abrikosov vortex dy-
namics driven at high velocity. This can be a general
example for high velocity dynamics in any diﬀerent con-
text of conﬁned geometry, for example in the dynamics
of magnetic entities such as skyrmions,20 in ﬂows and
mixing in microﬂuidic devices,21 as well as in high speed
impact of ﬂuid within a granular material.22

II. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Vortex pinning properties

Mo3Ge thin ﬁlms were grown on Si/SiO2 substrates
by pulsed laser deposition technique using a Nd:YAG
(λ = 532 nm) pulsed laser of 55 J energy and a repe-
tition rate of 10 Hz. The deposition was performed at a
pressure of 10−7 mbar. Using these parameters a deposi-
tion rate of 1.1 nm/min is achieved. All depositions were
done on Si wafers with an amorphous SiOx top-layer.
Microbridges were obtained by electron beam lithogra-
phy with thickness d = 50 nm, length L = 160 µm and
diﬀerent linewidths w = 5 ÷ 100 µm.23

The superconducting properties strongly depend on
the thickness of the ﬁlms. For 4 nm thick ﬁlms, there

2

orders of magnitude smaller than Hc2.24

Pulsed current-voltage (I-V ) measurements were per-
fomed in order to minimize self-heating eﬀects.17 Since
unavoidable self-heating may aﬀect experimental data,
ﬁrst of all we chose a pulsed biasing mode with a pulse
width of 2.5 ms and an inter-pulse period of 1 s.25

In Fig. 1 the current-voltage (I-V ) curves for the mea-
sured S100 macroscopic strip are shown along with the
data related to the critical current density Jc and the
instability current J∗ as a function of the applied mag-
netic ﬁeld. We note that for the whole ﬁeld range, Jc is
considerably smaller than J∗, and exhibits a very steep
decrease as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. The abso-
lute Jc values of the order of 104 A/cm2 reveal the weak
pinning nature of this material.

B. Vortex lattice instability at the mesoscopic scale

The mesoscopic limit is reached when d (cid:28) λ,26–28 with
λ the London penetration depth, and the sample width
is narrower than the Pearl length w ≤ Λ = 2λ2/d,26
and much wider than the Ginzburg-Landau coherence
length w (cid:29) ξGL. The estimated values of eﬀective co-
herence length and penetration depth at very low tem-
peratures for our Mo3Ge ﬁlms are as low as ξGL (cid:39) 5 nm
and as large as λ = 500 nm, corresponding to a large
Ginzburg-Landau parameter k = 100. The conditions
for the mesoscopic limit are reasonably satisﬁed for our
thin ﬁlms of w = 5 µm being Λ = 10 µm. On
these mesoscopic samples we checked that self-heating
eﬀects can be neglected. Indeed, no hysteresis occurs in
the I-V curves by performing measurements forth and
back (increasing and subsequently decreasing current)
of each curve by current biasing. Moreover, we can as-
sure that the instability point of each curve remains un-
changed and it is always reproducible, although at low
ﬁelds the metastable states can change before the nor-
mal state is reached. We also took into account self-
heating by considering the Bezuglyi-Shklovskij approach
for the term of quasi-particle overheating,13 leading to
the estimate of the threshold magnetic ﬁeld value BT =
0.374ehτE/kBσN d ∼ 3 T, where h is the heat transfer
coeﬃcient to the coolant,29 τE is the quasi-particle relax-
ation time,16 σN is the normal conductivity.23 In other
words, heating eﬀects become signiﬁcant for B > BT ,
out of the ﬁeld range in which the maximum speed limit
of the moving Abrikosov lattice is achieved. In addition,
we derived from the I-V data of Fig. 1a the dissipated
power P ∗ = I∗V ∗, which is an increasing function of the
magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 2. This is the experi-
mental evidence that thermal eﬀects are not determining
the ﬂux ﬂow instability points. Indeed, if this was the
case of a thermal runway, P ∗ should be independent of
magnetic ﬁeld, as already pointed out by Xiao et al..30
We also note that this magnetic ﬁeld dependence has
been predicted by Vina et al.31 on self-heating based cal-
culations. However they deal with an high temperature

is no superconducting transition. For ﬁlms thicker than
25 nm the superconducting transition saturates reaching
values up to 7 K.23 Typical values of the superconduct-
ing parameters for the highest Tc ﬁlm, namely S100, are:
Tc = 6.5 K, Hc2(0) ∼ 9 T, Jc(0) = 0.15 MA/cm2. In
addition it has been shown that usually the irreversible
magnetization loops are already closed at 20 mT, i.e. two

superconductor, YBCO microbridges, in a temperature
range close to Tc, 0.8 < T /Tc < 1, whose normal state
resistivity are several orders of magnitude larger than in
our mesoscopic strips.

In Fig. 3(a) we report the I-V curves as a function of
magnetic ﬁeld for the 5 µm mesoscopic strip Sx at the
lowest temperature T = 1.6 K. The inset shows a single
curve measured at low ﬁeld, in which multiple voltage
jumps are observed in the V (I) branch above the insta-
bility point (I∗, V ∗) and up to the normal current I∗
N . In
this case, the transition to the normal state follows sev-
eral metastable states, instead of being an abrupt voltage
jump.

Being Mo3Ge considered a weak pinning superconduc-
tor, almost linear ﬂux ﬂow branches are also expected
up to high bias current, as it is noticed both for Sx (see
Fig. 3(a)) and the 100 µm strip S100 (see Fig. 1(a)).
From the last point (I∗, V ∗) marked by the arrows in the
continuous branch, we estimate the mean critical veloc-
ity of the moving vortex lattice as v∗ = E∗/µ0H. By
extracting the v∗(µ0H), we obtain a surprising result:
the size reduction down to the mesoscopic scale implies
the change of the critical velocity behavior in a substan-
tial magnetic ﬁeld range µ0H < 0.5 T, as shown in Fig.
3(b) for the case of the 5 µm mesoscopic strip S1 and
the S100 macroscopic one.
Interestingly, from the fact
that v∗ estimations acquired at two diﬀerent tempera-
tures (see Fig. 3(c)) show no diﬀerence, we can suggest
that the observed change in v∗ for the mesoscopic sample
is rather T idependent.

C. Pinning eﬀect on vortex instability

In order to investigate if the observed behavior
v∗(µ0H) in the mesoscopic limit is inﬂuenced by any bulk
pinning, we changed the intrinsic pinning from the weak
Mo3Ge thin ﬁlms to a well known stronger pinning su-
perconductor, namely NbN.

We fabricated a mesoscopic strip of 1 µm width and
10 µm length, realized by e-beam litography on d =
20 nm thin ﬁlm, so that we obtained λ(0) = 400 nm and
Λ = 16 µm. Carrying out the same data analysis per-
formed in the case of the Mo3Ge samples, we obtained
the results collected in Fig. 4, where the critical voltages
of the NbN sample are plotted together with the data
related to the Mo3Ge sample S1. We ﬁnd that even a
strong pinning material on the mesoscopic scale has the
same striking behavior, although on a larger magnetic
ﬁeld range.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

A. Model

Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simula-
tions are used to gain information on the vortex dynam-
ics accounting for the I-V curves observed in the Mo3Ge
mesoscopic superconductor. We use the TDGL model
in its 2D simpliﬁed form, being justiﬁed when the strip
exhibits a large parameter k and it is in the mesoscopic
limit, that is our experimental case. In the mesoscopic
limit current density is reasonably uniform and the mag-

low ﬁelds close to H = 0. This may account for the dif-
ferent behavior of v∗(µ0H) in the mesoscopic strip with
respect to the macroscopic case.

4

In the following we will assume to work in a temper-
ature range so close to Tc, that the phenomenological
TDGL model is supposedly adequate. The 2D TDGL
equation for the complex order parameter ψ = |ψ|eiφ
takes the form:28,34,35

ψ = (∇ − iA)2 ψ +(cid:0)1 − |ψ|2(cid:1) ψ

+ iφ

(1)

coupled with the equation for the electrostatic poten-
tial ∇2φ = div [Im (ψ∗ (∇ − iA) ψ)], where A is the
vector potential associated to the external magnetic
ﬁeld H, φ is the electrostatic potential and the coef-
ﬁcient u = 5.79 governs the relaxation of the order
parameter.33 All physical quantities are measured in di-
mensionless units:28,34,35 the coordinates are in units
of the coherence length ξGL(T ), time is in units of
the relaxation time τ , the order parameter is in units
of the superconducting gap ∆(T ), the vector potential
is in units of Φ0/2πξGL (Φ0 is the quantum of mag-
netic ﬂux), and the electrostatic potential is in units of
φ0(T ) = ¯h/2eτ . In these units the magnetic ﬁeld is scaled
with Hc2(T ) = Φ0/2πξ2
GL and the current density with
j0(T ) = cΦ0/8π2λ2ξGL. The ﬁeld H is applied in the z
direction and the current density J is applied in the y-
direction. We make use of the “bridge” boundary condi-
tion in the y-direction and of an insulator-superconductor
boundary condition in the x-direction.28,34,35

B. Flux ﬂow results

In Fig. 5(a), we show the calculated E(J) curves, in
the low electric ﬁeld range, for several values of mag-
netic ﬁeld H applied perpendicular to the strip. Curves
display a fully linear (at moderate and high ﬁelds) or
nearly linear (at low ﬁelds) ﬂux-ﬂow branch starting at
some critical current Jc in the rather large current range
Jc < J < J∗
l , followed by a deviation from linear behav-
l < J < J∗ and ending
ior in the limited current range J∗
with a more or less abrupt transition to the fully normal
state. The red line is displayed as a guide to the eye
to mark the critical points (E∗
l ) where the departure
from almost linear behavior occurs. The circles mark the
instability points (E∗, J∗) at which the continuos non-
linear branch ends and a very high diﬀerential resistivity
branch (at moderate/high ﬁelds) or a meta-stable branch
(at low ﬁelds) is followed before transition to the normal
state is achieved. The Fig. 5(b) shows the relevant cur-
rent densities J∗
l , J∗, Jc as a function of magnetic ﬁeld.
The average critical velocity of the linear v∗
l /µoH
and nonlinear v∗ = E∗/µoH regimes are plotted as a
function of applied magnetic ﬁeld in Fig. 5(c). In anal-
ogy with experimental data, both critical velocities ex-
hibit a non-monotonic behavior with a maximum at a
certain ﬁeld Hcr, after which a decreasing function of H

netic ﬁeld which is induced by the transport and screen-
ing currents can be usually neglected.26–28 Moreover, in
the model we neglect intrinsic bulk pinning, according to
experimental data.

In the numerical simulations we assume the strip width
equal to w = 160ξL in the x-direction and length L =
80ξL in the y-direction. Experimentally, the phenomenon
we want to describe is found almost independent of tem-
perature, v∗(µ0H, T ), and it is recorded up to the reduced
temperature t = 0.86. At this reduced temperature the
normalized width of the real strips is w = 370ξL.
In-
deed, we use the smaller width w = 160ξL in the simu-
lations either because we checked that vortex dynamics
involved did not change appreciably if such dimensions
were further increased and because would be more cum-
bersome to present snapshots of vortex dynamics cover-
ing the larger width of 370ξL, being vortex cores extended
for only about 3ξL.

We also underline that in the non-mesoscopic regime
with no bulk pinning (see, e.g., Ref.11) the current dis-
tribution is strongly peaked at edges of the strip and the
current-assisted vortex nucleation is present also at ﬁelds
H < HS/2, where HS is the ﬁeld at which static vortices
are present in the strip also for J = 0.27,28,32 In particu-
lar, at zero applied ﬁeld vortices and antivortices nucleate
at edges and annihilate at center of the strip.11 On the
contrary, the region 0 < H < HS/2 of hampered vortex
nucleation is observed in a mesoscopic system compelling
a vortex velocity increase with magnetic ﬁeld from zero
to a maximum value. This region can be hidden in the
macroscopic system, where the ﬁnite (maximum) value
of the average velocity can be achieved already at very

5

of states which in our analysis involves the transition to
the normal state with a more or less pronounced inter-
mittent eﬀect [see snapshot IV and V]. Interestingly, this
intermittence is also observed in the experimental curves
[see inset of Fig. 3(a)]. We should remark that, for the
magnetic ﬁeld range HS/2 < H < HS, there exists a ﬁ-
nite current range where nearly ordered vortex matter is
driven by the bias current. In this lower ﬁeld region vor-
tices can nucleate in the strip only when a quite large
uniformly distributed transport current (∼ Jdp) helps
the screening current to suppress the order parameter
at one of the edges of the strip, thus promoting vortex
nucleation.28,32,36

In Fig. 6 we include the full zoology of vortex lattice
phases in motion, with particular attention on the dy-
namic phase diagram in which non-linearity arises. Here
some well-known phases are reported for completeness:
the static vortex lattice which exists only for J < Jc
and the fully normal phase for J > J∗
N . In the low ﬁeld
region HS/2 < H < HS, Region I corresponds to the
current assisted vortex nucleation with an almost trian-
gular moving vortex lattice, that results in the almost
linear ﬂux ﬂow motion Jc < J < J∗
l . At larger cur-
rents we ﬁnd other two possible nonequilibrium phases,
l < J < J∗) a row-like moving
II and III. In Region II (J∗
vortex lattice can exist with a corresponding ﬁlamentary
displacement of vortices (vortex river). For larger cur-
rents clusters of normal metal phase develop which match
the intermittence phase III with metastable states before
reaching the fully normal phase. In agreement with ana-
lytical predictions presented in Ref. 32, in the ﬁeld range
0 < H < HS/2 transport-current-assisted discrete vor-
tex nucleation is practically absent. Here, we only ob-
serve a disordered bundlelike vortex nucleation and mo-
tion accounting for a strongly nonlinear E(J) branch up
to J∗ (Region IV), followed by a regime (Region V) where
ﬂux bundles are mixed to a clusterized normal phase, as
shown in snapshot V of Fig. 6. At H > HS, Region VI
corresponds to the ordinary linear ﬂux ﬂow accounted by
a moving triangular lattice (snapshot VI). This regular
motion is observed up to a critical current J∗
l resulting
in a nearly linear branch of the E(J) curve. Region VII
marks the nonlinear ﬂux ﬂow motion for J∗
l < J < J∗
accounted for a moving glassy lattice (snapshot VII).
Above the instability current J∗, jumps to high resis-
tivity branches can occur (Region VIII). These branches,
which extend in the range J∗ < J < J∗
kv, are accounted
for a channel-like structure of vortices as shown in snap-
shot VIII, very similar to the one described in Ref. 11.
For J > J∗
kv, the vortex channel structure leads to the
opening of normal channels (see snapshot IX), which are
responsible for a more less abrupt transition to the high-
est resistive state, i.e. the normal state. Fast (kinemat-
ics) vortices surﬁng on channels of very depressed super-
conductivity shown in snapshot VIII were investigated
in detail in Ref. 11 within the generalized TDGL model
that accounts for the non-equilibrium eﬀects through a
parameter γ.33 In our simulations we used the standard

is established, approximately as H−1/2.17 In the follow-
ing we focus on the vortex dynamics accounting for the
E(J) in the magnetic ﬁeld range around Hcr where such
a crossover is found (see Fig. 5(c)) and v∗
max is reached.
In Fig. 5(b) we can distinguish, in the magnetic ﬁeld
range in which the critical velocity is increasing, the “en-
try ﬁeld” H = HS, that is HS = 0.021Hc2. Inspection of
Fig. 5(b) and 5(c) suggests that the crossover ﬁeld Hcr
can essentially be identiﬁed with Hs/2.

C. Nonequilibrium phase diagram

At magnetic ﬁelds larger than the entry ﬁeld HS a reg-
ular Abrikosov vortex lattice is expected to be present
even at J = 0. At ﬁelds HS/2 < H < HS, by increasing
the driving current, vortices nucleate to the left edge of
the strip but start to ﬂow only at some ﬁnite current Jc,
due to the presence of a surface barrier in the system.27,28
Though a triangular vortex lattice is not fully created,
there exists a quasi-ordered motion of vortices [see snap-
shot I in Fig. 6], that results in an almost linear branch in
the E(J) curve up to J∗
l . By further increasing current,
a departure from nearly linear E(J) curve occurs up to
the critical current J∗, and vortex ﬂow transforms to a
row-like structure, as visualized in snapshot II. At cur-
rents larger than J∗ the row structure evolves into normal
channel-like conﬁguration, as shown in snapshot III. This
corresponds to a noisy behavior in the E(J) curve and to
dynamical states in which the presence of vortices is re-
stored at the expense of normal channels (see inset of Fig.
5(a)). For ﬁelds H < HS/2, we note only the sequence

6

identiﬁed the peculiar “entry ﬁeld” H = HS above which a regular vortex lattice can be set in motion, as well as the instability
current density J∗ above which moving ordinary vortices transform in kinematic vortices at moderate/high ﬁelds or ordinary
vortex bundles mixed to clusterized normal regions at low ﬁeld. When present, normal regions expand at expense of vortex
matter with increasing current up to a ﬁnal J∗
N where the system undergoes the transition to the fully normal state. Snapshots
show the evolution of the vortex lattice conﬁguration on increasing the driving current.

TDGL with γ = 0 and, though present, the high re-
sistivity branches accounted for kinematic vortices are
consistently33 recovered only in a current range much
narrower than the one found in Ref. 11.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the framework of vortex dynamics we identify the
limiting behavior of the Abrikosov lattice stability driven
at high vortex velocity in the absence of bulk pinning,
with the only constrain of conﬁned mesoscopic geometry.
The possibility to reach a maximum critical velocity as
a function of the applied magnetic ﬁeld is naturally ex-
plained by the TDGL phenomenological approach, which
allows us to give a complete view of nonequilibrium vor-
tex phases tunable by the external magnetic ﬁeld and/or
the bias current in a dynamic phase diagram. In a meso-
scopic superconductor the physical meaning of such speed
limit to the Abrikosov vortex velocity is strictly con-
nected to the presence of a surface pinning, namely an
edge barrier, which ﬁrst hampers and then delays the
lattice motion, due to the rearrangement of vortices con-
ﬁguration in rows-like ﬂow rather than keeping the usual
ordered triangular vortex lattice in motion. To visual-
ize it, real-space images of the driven lattice show that
motion occurs along channels that are aligned with the
direction of the driving force and periodically spaced in

the transverse direction. Phase slips, however, occur at
the channel boundaries, indicating that channels become
uncorrelated at very high driving current, before the in-
stability takes place. In our case those channels may exist
only at a velocity v < v∗(Hcr) = v∗
max, that is the speed
limit for the moving Abrikosov lattice.

The sequence in which these dynamical phases appear
at high bias currents is usually nontrivial, and the simpli-
ﬁed models of vortices as pointlike classical particles seem
to have missed what a more realistic approach based on
TDGL formalism is able to catch.37

A further comparison of data on weak Mo3Ge super-
conductor with the bulk pinning eﬀects in NbN surpris-
ingly led to similar results, thus conferring to our ﬁnd-
ings even more generality. Our results demonstrate that
geometric reduction on mesoscopic scale can radically
change the dissipative regimes in superconducting ma-
terials, thus improving the performance of those devices
based on superconducting nanostructures.
