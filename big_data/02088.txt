SHAPE PROGRAMMING FOR NARROW RIBBONS OF

NEMATIC ELASTOMERS

VIRGINIA AGOSTINIANI, ANTONIO DESIMONE, AND KONSTANTINOS KOUMATOS

Abstract. Using the theory of Γ-convergence, we derive from three-dimension-
al elasticity new one-dimensional models for non-Euclidean elastic ribbons, i.e.
ribbons exhibiting spontaneous curvature and twist. We apply the models to
shape-selection problems for thin ﬁlms of nematic elastomers with twist and
splay-bend texture of the nematic director. For the former, we discuss the
possibility of helicoid-like shapes as an alternative to spiral ribbons.

1. Introduction

Shape morphing systems are common in Biology. They are used to control
locomotion in unicellular organisms [8, 7] and to produce controlled motions in
plants [12, 16, 19, 31, 5]. Diﬀerential swelling and shrinkage processes, partially
hindered by ﬁbers, lead to dynamical conformation changes which are essential
in the life of many botanical systems [28].
Inspired by Nature, many attempts
have been reported in the recent literature to synthesize artiﬁcial shape-morphing
systems based on synthetic soft materials [29, 24, 20] and the interest in these
phenomena is steadily growing.

A useful tool has emerged in the mathematical literature to describe the me-
chanics of shape programming, namely, non-Euclidean structures (non-Euclidean
plates and rods). These are elastic structures described by functionals which are
minimised when exhibiting nonzero curvature. The relevant energy functionals are
often postulated on the basis of physical intuition [22], but in more recent attempts
they are derived from three dimensional models [27, 23, 3], through rigorous di-
mension reduction based on the theory of Γ-convergence, following the approach
pioneered in [18].

Liquid crystal elastomers provide an interesting model system for the study
of shape programming. They are polymeric materials that respond to external
stimuli (temperature, light, electric ﬁelds) by changing shape [33, 13, 4, 2, 1] and
are typically manufactured as thin ﬁlms [9, 14, 6, 11, 10]. Suitable textures of
the nematic director imprinted at fabrication lead to thin structures with tunable
and controllable spontaneous curvature, see [25, 26, 32]. In particular, for the twist
geometry (nematic director always parallel to the mid-plane of the ﬁlm and rotating
by π/2 from the bottom to the top surface of the ﬁlm) it has been observed both
experimentally and computationally [26, 30] that, depending on the aspect ratio
of the mid-plane, either spiral ribbons (this is the case of large width over length
aspect ratio) or helicoid-like shapes (this is the case of small width over length
aspect ratio) emerge spontaneously.

In this paper, we provide a rigorous mathematical description of thin structures
of nematic elastomers (in the case of twist and splay-bend geometry) where the
minimisers of the deduced energy functionals reproduce the experimentally observed
minimum energy conﬁgurations. Our analysis stems from the combination of two
main results: ﬁrst, we use the 3D-to-2D dimension reduction result in [3] for (non-
Euclidean) thin ﬁlms of nematic elastomers, and, secondly, we use a non-Euclidean

1

version of the 2D-to-1D dimension reduction result of [17], where a corrected version
of the well-known Sadowsky functional is derived for the mechanical description of
inextensible elastic ribbons. The reader is also referred to [21, 15] and all other
papers in the same special issue of the Journal of Elasticity for more material on
the mechanics of elastic ribbons.

Our results show that the technique of rigorous dimensional reduction based
on Γ-convergence, far from being just a mathematical exercise, can provide a tool
to derive, rather than postulate, the functional form and the material parameters
(elastic constants, spontaneous curvature and twist, etc...) for dimensionally re-
duced models of thin structures. We concentrate our discussion on liquid crystal
elastomers, but clearly our method is applicable to more general systems, when-
ever diﬀerential spontaneous distortions in the cross section induce spontaneous
curvature and twist of the mid-line of the rod.

The starting point of the subsequent analysis is a family of non-Euclidean plate
models deﬁned on a narrow strip of width ε cut out from the plane and forming an
angle θ with the horizontal axis (see (2.4) below). In Section 2 we set-up our 2D
model and show that minor modiﬁcations of the results of [17] allow us to derive
in the limit as ε ↓ 0 the 1D model deﬁned in (2.11)–(2.12). Again in Section 2,
we observe that examples of our starting 2D theory are given by twist and splay-
bend nematic elastomer sheets, as obtained from 3D nonlinear elasticity in [3]. The
limiting 1D theory, which is a non-Euclidean rod theory, is then explicitly computed
for twist and splay-bend nematic elastomers in Section 3 and 4, respectively. In
particular, the explicit expression of the limiting energy densities associated with
the rods through their ﬂexural strains around the width axis and the torsional
strains, and the corresponding minimisers, are given in Proposition 3.2 and Lemma
3.3 (in the twist case) and in Proposition 4.1 and Lemma 4.2 (in the splay-bend
case).

2. A non-Euclidean Sadowsky functional

Let ω be an open planar domain of R2. In the framework of a nonlinear plate

theory [18], we consider the bending energy

c1|Aˆv(ˆz) − ¯A|2 + c2 tr2(Aˆv(ˆz) − ¯A) + ¯e

dˆz

(2.1)

ω

associated with a developable surface ˆv(ω), ˆv being a deformation from ω to R3.
In the previous expression, Aˆv(·) ∈ R2×2
sym denotes the second fundamental form of
ˆv(ω), c1 > 0 and c2 > 0 are material constants, and ¯A ∈ R2×2
sym and ¯e represent
a characteristic target curvature tensor and a characteristic nonnegative energy
constant, respectively. Moreover, the notation tr2A stands for the square of the
trace of A. We recall that Aˆv can be expressed as (∇ˆv)T∇ˆν, where ˆν = ∂z1 ˆv∧ ∂z2 ˆv.
In [3], the two-dimensional energy (2.1) has been rigorously derived from a three
dimensional model for thin ﬁlms of nematic elastomers with splay-bend and twist
orientation of the nematic directors along the thickness and the following explicit
formulas have been obtained for ¯A

η0 is a positive dimensionless parameter quantifying the magnitude of the sponta-
neous strain variation along the (small) thickness h0 of the ﬁlm, µ is the elastic
shear modulus, and λ + 2µ/3 is the bulk modulus. Also, the material constants
appearing in (2.1) are given by c1 = µ/12 and c2 = λµ/12. We refer the reader to
[3] for a detailed description of the three-dimensional model and of the splay-bend
and twist nematic director ﬁelds. In Sections 3 and 4 we specialize our results to
the case where the curvature tensor ¯A is of the form (2.2), while in the rest of this
section we focus on a general energy density of type (2.1).

and the notation is meant to remind the reader that, as a function of the matrix
A, Lθ is linear. In the above expression, we have set c = c1 + c2 and we have made
use of the fact that

tr2A = |A|2 + 2 det A,

for all A ∈ R2×2
curvature associated with v(Sε) vanishes, i.e.

sym. In fact, since v is an isometry of the planar strip Sε, the Gaussian

det Av(z) = 0.

we change variables and deﬁne the rescaled version y : S → R3 of v, given by

y(x1, x2) = v(x1, εx2).

The following procedure is rather standard and we use the notation of [17] as, in
the sequel, our proofs will be largely based on this paper. By introducing the scaled
gradient

∇ε· = (∂1 · |ε−1∂2·)

we obtain that ∇εy(x1, x2) = ∇v(x1, εx2) and y belongs to the space of scaled
isometries of S deﬁned as
W2,2

y ∈ W2,2(S, R3) : |∂1y| = |ε−1∂2y| = 1, ∂1y·∂2y = 0 a.e. in S

Similarly, we may deﬁne the scaled unit normal to y(S) by

ny,ε = ∂1y ∧ ε−1∂2y

and the scaled second fundamental form associated to y(S) by
ε−1ny,ε · ∂1∂2y
ε−2ny,ε · ∂2∂2y

In proving the existence of a recovery sequence, we will need the following lemma

In the case where the (physical) energy (2.4) is derived from a three-dimensional
model with a twist-type nematic director ﬁeld imprinted in the thickness of an
elastomeric thin ﬁlm, the characteristic quantities ¯A and ¯e present in (2.4) are
given by ¯AT and ¯eT in formulas (2.2) and (2.3). Correspondingly, the θ-dependent
target curvature tensor ¯Aθ deﬁned in (2.6) becomes

Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.2 apply in particular for the functionals (3.2). As an
easy consequence of the compactness and the Γ-convergence results, via standard
arguments of the theory of Γ-convergence, the following corollary holds. In order

that the convergence in (3.5) can be checked by hand. The minimizing sequences
and the minimizer of J θ

Note that if α = 0, f reduces to the diﬀerentiable function

We now focus on the minimisers of Q

S. As for the twist case, when k = 0 and up
θ
to additive and multiplicative constants, the function Q
S reduces to the function
deﬁned in (3.6), which is minimised at (0, 0). When instead k > 0, diﬀerently from
θ
the twist case we have that for every θ the minimiser of Q
S is a (θ-dependent)
single point, in view of the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2. For every 0 ≤ θ < π, Q

S is minimised precisely at (αS

Proof. Consider the nontrivial case k (cid:54)= 0. A straightforward computation shows

that there are no critical points of Q

We ﬁrst examine the cases θ = 0 and θ = π/2. In these cases we have bθ = 0 and
|aθ| = 1, so that from (4.4) we get β = 0, since (α2 + β2)/α (cid:54)= (kdθ/(2c) in the
interior of VS. Setting β = 0 in (4.3) we then get α = − k
2c (c1aθ + c + c2). Now, an
easy calculation shows that in the case θ = 0 the point (αS
0 ) lies in the interior
of VS and it is the global minimiser of Q
θ
S. On the other hand, in the case θ = π/2
another easy computation show that the the point (−kc2/c, 0) lies in DS and it is
thus not a critical point of our function in the interior of VS. Then, comparing
on the boundaries of DS and US, we ﬁnd that the minimum is
π/2
the values of Q
S
achieved at (αS
π/2, βS
π/2) = (0, 0). Moreover, it can be readily checked that (4.2)
holds for θ = 0 and θ = π/2.
Consider now an arbitrary θ ∈ (0, π) \ {π/2} and note that in this case bθ (cid:54)= 0
and |aθ| < 1. As before, we search for critical points of Q
S in the interior of VS.
From (4.4) we get in particular β (cid:54)= 0. Therefore, we may divide (4.3) by (4.4)
getting

θ

(4.5)
and in turn that |α| = |aθα − bθβ|. Hence, either α = aθα − bθβ or α = bθβ − aθα.
Suppose that the former case holds true or, equivalently, that
