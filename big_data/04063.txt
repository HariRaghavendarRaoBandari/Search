The eﬀects of several dark energy models on gravitational time delay of particles with non-zero
mass are investigated and analytical expressions for the same are obtained at the ﬁrst order accuracy.
Also the expression for gravitational time delay under the inﬂuence of conformal gravity potential
that well describes the ﬂat rotation curve of spiral galaxies is derived. The ﬁndings suggest that i)
the conformal gravity description of dark matter reduces the net time delay in contrast to the eﬀect
of normal dark matter and therefore in principle the models can be discriminated using gravitational
time delay observations and ii)the eﬀect of dark energy/ﬂat rotation curve may be revealed from high
precision measurements of gravitational time delay of particles involving megaparsec and beyond
distance-scale.

INTRODUCTION

The explanation of the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe requires that the bulk of the energy density
in the Universe is repulsive, which is termed as dark energy (DE). On the other hand, galactic rotation curves and few
other observations demand for existence of a non-luminous matter component, dubbed dark matter (DM). Several
independent analysis of astrophysical and cosmological data now ﬁrmly suggest that DE, DM and luminous matter
constitute about 68%, 27% and 5% of the total energy budget of the universe [1].

Out of the several wishful candidates for DE, the simplest candidate is the cosmological constant (Λ). The model
involving cosmological constant, the so called ΛCDM model with a value of Λ nearly 10−56cm−2 and CDM refers to
cold DM, provides an excellent ﬁt to the wealth of high-precision observational data, on the basis of a remarkably
small number of cosmological parameters [2,3,4]. But the physical origin of cosmological constant remains a major
problem. Besides due to its non evolving nature, the ΛCDM model suﬀers from the so-called coincidence problem [5].
Alternative candidates of DE include scalar-ﬁeld models like quintessence [6,4], k-essence [7,8] and phantom ﬁeld [9].
There are also proposals for modiﬁcation of general relativity to account for the accelerated expansion without the
need for DE which include scalar-tensor theories (or equivalently f(R) theories) [10,11], conformal gravity [12], massive
gravity theories [13] including Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld gravity [14], etc. The nature of DM is also
unknown at present but DM is a testable proposition in direct-detection experiments unlike DE. The gravitational
eﬀect of DM within a galaxy depends on the radial density proﬁle of DM. While the ﬂat rotation curve feature implies
a logarithmic gravitational potential, the rotation curve data points for a large sample of spiral galaxies were also
found to describe well by a gravitational potential linear in r [15].

Both DE and DM are expected to inﬂuence gravitational phenomena at all distance scales including those in the
solar system.
In solar system the inﬂuence of DE has been studied mainly through cosmological constant and is
found to be maximum in the case of perihelion shift of mercury orbit where the Λ contribution is about 10−15 of
the total shift [16] and measurements of advances in the perihelia of Mercury imposes an upper limit Λ < 10−42m−2
[17]. On the other hand, analysis of the perihelion precession of Mercury, Earth, and Mars give the upper bound
on the density of DM ρdm < 3 × 10−19 g/cm3 [18]. Note that the rotation curve data suggests that the density of
DM in the Milky Way at the location of solar system is ρdm = 0.5 × 10−24 g/cm3 [19]. DE is mainly eﬀective at
cosmological (megaparsec) scales and as a result the contribution of DE could be signiﬁcant (larger than the second
order term) even in a local gravitational phenomenon when kiloparsec (Kpc) to megaparsec (Mpc) scale distances are
involved, such as the gravitational bending of light by cluster of galaxies [20] or the relativistic accretion phenomena
around massive BHs (see [21] and references therein; [22]), whereas the eﬀect of DM is signiﬁcant at the outer part of
galaxies. Consequently, for large distance scales, astrophysical and cosmological phenomena are likely to be dictated
by DM/DE and hence to probe DE/DM from local phenomena, one has to explore the local gravitational phenomena
involving Kpc to Mpc distance-scale.

The phenomenon of gravitational time delay of an electrically neutral (henceforth termed as just neutral throughout
the rest of the manuscript) particle with non-zero mass such as neutrino/neutron from an extra-galactic source may

2

oﬀer a possibility of studying the inﬂuence of DE/DM as it involves Mpc distance-scale. Here it is worthwhile to
mention that, measurements of gravitational time delay, for example, an extra time delay that light suﬀers while
propagating in gravitational ﬁeld over the time required for light transmission between two points in Minkowski
spacetime, through Doppler tracking of the Cassini spacecraft on its way to the Saturn, currently imposes the most
stringent constraint on the ﬁrst parameterized post-Newtonian parameter γ with γ − 1 < (2.1 ± 2.3) × 10−5 [23].
Note that γ is zero in the Newtonian theory, unity in general relativity, and γ − 1 is considered as a measure of a
deviation from general relativity. However, the eﬀect of cosmological constant on gravitational time delay of photon is
comparatively less and solar system measurements give only the restriction Λ ≤ 10−24m−2 [16]. The eﬀect of DE on
gravitational time delay of photons has already been investigated by Asada [24]. Very recently, the eﬀect of DE/DM
on gravitational time advancement (negative eﬀective time delay) has been investigated by Ghosh and Bhadra [25].
Considering a neutral particle for time delay measurement (as well as other similar eﬀects) is advantageous over photon
due to the fact that the time delay for particle depends also on the mass and energy of the particle, thereby oﬀering
additional control on the measurement [26] and we shall argue later in the discussion section that this additional
control should be useful to study experimentally gravitational time delay involving Kpc distance scale.

In the present work we derive the analytical expression of gravitational time delay for particles having non-zero rest
mass considering the presence of DE and DM and discuss about the experimental feasibility to test DE/DM eﬀects
on time delay experimentally in future. The letter is organized as follows: in the next section we would formulate the
problem mathematically for gravitational time delay corresponding to a neutral particle with non-zero rest mass for
general spherically symmetric static spacetime. In §3 we derive the analytical expression for time delay in presence of
DE/DM considering up to ﬁrst order in M/r and β, where M is the mass of the gravitating object, β is the parameter
describing the strength of DE/DM. In §4 we discuss our results stressing the possibilities of experimental detection
of such eﬀects in a future experiment. Finally, we conclude in §5.

II. GRAVITATIONAL TIME DELAY OF A NEUTRAL PARTICLE WITH MASS

For a general static spherically symmetric metric of the form

where, dΩ2 = dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2 and c the usual speed of light, the geodesic equations for a test particle motion in

equatorial plane around a spherical matter distribution having mass M lead to the following relation

ds2 = c2B(r)dt2 − A(r)dr2 − r2dΩ2

proper time τ and t (dτ 2 = α2 dp2). For particle with non-zero rest mass m, α2 > 0; whereas for particle with zero
rest mass, α2 = 0. At the distance of closest approach rp, dr

dt must vanish, i.e., dr

dt|r=rp = 0. This gives

From Eqs. (2) and (3), we obtain the time required by a particle to traverse a distance from rp to r, which is given

DE/DM

In presence of DE/DM the exterior vacuum spacetime will be no longer Schwarzschild geometry but a modiﬁed

one. Here we shall consider the following form of the metric tensor

symmetric matter distribution on the background of an accelerating universe in DGP braneworld gravity provided

case 4: When n = 2, β1 = β2 = Λ/3 and m = µ the above metric describes the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SDS) or
Kotler space-time which is the exterior space time due to a static spherically symmetric mass distribution in presence
of the cosmological constant Λ with Λ ∼ 10−56cm−2 [30].
Note that m and M have been deﬁned in §2. Using DE/DM led by A(r) and B(r), restricting up to ﬁrst order
correction due to βi (i=1,2), and neglecting the terms of the order M 2 and beyond, P(r, α2) given by Eq. (5) reduces
to the form, given by

For α2 = 0, Eq. (10) with Eq. (13) gives the gravitational time delay for photon which agrees with the results
In deriving the contribution of βi on gravitational time delay
obtained by Asada [24] at the leading order in r.
we ignore the cross terms between M and βi (and higher order terms in βi) since βi is small. However, in some
circumstances the cross terms may be relevant which are given in the appendix.

IV. DISCUSSIONS

The Eq. (10) through Eqs. (11)-(13) imply that DE enhances the time delay eﬀect. Similar eﬀects of DE were
noted earlier for photons [16,24]. For gravitational time delay the inﬂuences of DE is somewhat counter intuitive;
the repulsive nature of DE is expected to act diﬀerently than normal mass. Note that the gravitational bending
angle of photon is reduced by the repulsive nature of DE [31]. The potential linear in radial distance that describes
the ﬂat rotation curves of spiral galaxies well, reduces the net time delay which is opposite to the eﬀect of normal
dark matter on gravitational time delay and hence the conformal gravity description of galactic rotation curve can be
discriminated from normal dark matter from gravitational time delay measurement involving Mpc distance scale, at
least in principle.

The Eq. (10) with Eqs. (11) and (12) suggest that the DE and DM contribution to the time delay eﬀect will be of
the same order to the pure Schwarzschild contribution at distance scale roughly 30 Kpc and 300 Kpc respectively in
our galaxy. Hence to detect the inﬂuences of DE/DM through gravitational time delay eﬀect one needs to conduct
the measurements involving Kpc distance-scale. Experimentally gravitational time delay is studied in solar system by
measuring the round-trip travel time of an electromagnetic signal emitted from the Earth past the Sun to a planet or
satellite and returned back to the Earth. Such a strategy is of course impractical for measuring gravitational time delay
when Kpc scale distance is involved. Instead a feasible approach is to study the time diﬀerence of arrival of neutral
particles with same mass at two (or more) diﬀerent energies from a stellar collapse scenario such as extragalactic
gamma ray bursts (GRBs) or supernova explosions (SNe).

The theories of stellar collapse [32,33] demand that neutrinos of diﬀerent energies should emit in a short pulse of
about 10 msec duration which is also indicated experimentally [34,35]. The photons are expected to emit a few hours
later than the neutrino emission [32,33]. Since gravitational time delay by the galaxy causes a time delay about 5
months [36], so the diﬀerence in arrival times of neutrinos and photons from extragalactic GRBs or SNe also may
probe DE/DM inﬂuence on gravitational time delay. We, therefore, shall evaluate analytical expressions for diﬀerence

in arrival times between neutral particles having non-zero rest mass (such as neutrinos) of two diﬀerent energies and
that between particle and photon.

5

We consider the scenario that the particle/photon is emitted from the source S(R), where ‘R’ represents the radial
coordinate of source ‘S(R)’, reaches the observer O(ro) at ro (here the earth) with the distance of closest approach rp.
All the distances are measured taking the center of the spherical mass distribution with mass M as the center of the
coordinate system. Hence the total transit time is Tn (ro, R) = tn (ro, rp) + tn (rp, R) . The particle/photon emitted
from the source suﬀers a gravitational time delay due to the spherical mass distribution. For the test particle with
mass m and energy ε as received by the observer, the parameter α2 (as described in Eq. (2) ) and other subsequent
o(cid:17) (restricting up to ﬁrst order correction
equations in §2, §3) is given by [26]; α2 = m2
ε1 and ∆Tn|m=0
due to β1). As we wish to focus on highly relativistic particles, we consider ε >> m. Denoting ∆Tn|ε2
as the diﬀerence in arrival times between particles with same mass m but two diﬀerent energies ε1 and ε2 and the
diﬀerence in arrival times between particle with mass m and energy ε and photon, respectively, and restricting to the
ﬁrst order in the expansion of M and m2/ε2, we get the most general expressions (ignoring the cross terms between
M and βi):

To ﬁnd out the DM/DE contribution to gravitational time delay that the signal (like neutrino with mass ‘m’)
suﬀers while travelling from a distant source to the observer on earth about gravitating mass distribution with mass
M , it is necessary to estimate in actual seconds, the quantities ∆T1|m=0
ε1 , explicitly for
terms corresponding to DM and DE, respectively. To compute these terms explicitly due to contribution of DM/DE
as well as to clearly reveal the eﬀects of DM and DE we focus on two (mathematically) simple but practically feasible
scenarios as described hereunder.

m or ∆T2|ε2

m or ∆T1|ε2

ε1 , ∆T2|m=0

In one scenario, the signal originates from a distant-source, and the observer O(ro) is located on the earth at a
distance ro from the center of the spherical mass distribution. This can be represented by the condition R >> rp
and rp ∼ ro; which imply DS >> rp, DS >> ro. Such a scenario will arise, for example, if a signal originates
from a distance local extragalactic source due to supernova explosion like that in the case of SN 1987A and suﬀers
gravitational time delay by our galaxy. Another example of such a scenario is that when the source is an extragalactic
one, situated far away from our local group and the signal from the source suﬀers gravitational time delay due to the
contribution of the local group itself while reaching to the observer on the earth.

Corresponding to this scenario, it can be seen from the Eqs. (16) and (17) that the diﬀerence in arrival time
between particles with same mass but diﬀerent energies ε1 and ε2 with ε2 > ε1 or between particle with mass m
and energy ε and photon is reduced due to cosmological constant; for the ﬂat rotation curve similar aspect is also
noticed from Eqs. (14) and (15). To ascertain the eﬀective contribution to gravitational time delay due to DM/DE
as compared to the pure Schwarzschild contribution for the cases described by the Eqs. (14) to (17), it is necessary
to compute the magnitude of the ratio (χ) between these two contributing terms given in Eqs. (14) to (17). For the

scenario described here, for the DM model, this ratio χ ≈ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
χ ≈(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

In the other scenario, the source S(R) may be situated near to the center of the spherical mass distribution, however,
S(R) is located far away from the observer on the earth. This can be represented by the condition R ∼ rp; which
imply DS ∼ ro, ro >> rp. Such a scenario will arise when a core-collapse extragalactic SNe/GRB occurs near to the
center of our local group and the signal originating from SNe/GRB is detected by the observer on the earth. For the

scenario described here, χ ≈(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for the DM model, whereas for the DE model (described by λ), χ ≈(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

For this scenario, corresponding to DM model describing the galactic rotation curves, the expressions of diﬀerence
in arrival times between particles with same mass but diﬀerent energies ε1 and ε2 with ε2 > ε1 or between particle
with mass m and energy ε and photon are identical to those in earlier mentioned scenario as given by Eqs. (20) to
(21) whereas for cosmological constant model describing DE, the diﬀerences in arrival times are just double to those
in the previous scenario as given in Eqs. (22) and (23). Note that the galactic rotation curve feature reduces the net
time delay, whereas for the cosmological constant, the reverse (enhance) aspect is noticed from Eqs. (16) and (17),
which should be a distinguishing signature between DE and DM.

delay), corresponding to the two scenarios described here, for both DM and DE (described by λ) models. It is to be

time delay (χ) for both DM and DE (described by λ) models is independent of the distance of source from the
observer, as well as of the closest distance of approach, however, only depends on the distance of the observer on earth
from the gravitational mass distribution about which the signal suﬀers time delay. In Table 1 we choose appropriate
gravitating systems (G.M ) and values of mass of gravitating systems about which the signal (like neutrino signal)
suﬀers gravitational time delay, and corresponding values of ro.

In Table 2, we estimate the values of diﬀerences in arrival times for similar choice of gravitating systems as in Table
1. For the case R >> rp, corresponding to our local group, we choose a distant core-collapse SNe emitting neutrinos,
located at a typical distance of ∼ 10 Mpc from the observer on earth whereas for local supercluster we choose the
source at 50 Mpc away. Similarly for the case R ∼ rp, corresponding to our local group, we choose a core-collapse
SNe emitting neutrinos from near to the center of the mass of the local group; for which DS ∼ ro. Corresponding to
our galaxy about which the signal suﬀers gravitational time delay, for the case R >> rp, we choose a SNe neutrino
emitting source to be located at a typical distance of ∼ 50 Kpc from the observer on earth; whereas, for the case
R ∼ rp, we choose a SNe emitting source located near to center of our galaxy. In Table 2, we display the estimated
values of diﬀerences in arrival time corresponding to all three neutrino ﬂavors assuming their masses equal to the
experimentally obtained upper bound limits [36] and between photon (i.e., ∆Tn|m=0
m ,{n = 1, 2}) in seconds, for the
explicit contribution of DM and DE. For νe and νµ, we choose the typical value of energy of the observed signal ε = 10
MeV, however for ντ , we choose the energy of the observed signal to be ε = 100 MeV, owing to the large upper bound
limit of its mass.

When we consider diﬀerence in arrival times of two neutrinos with diﬀerent energies we should get the time delay of
the same order as displayed in Table 2 for diﬀerence in arrival times of photon and neutrino unless two energies are very
close. Measurement of the diﬀerences in arrival times of neutrinos with diﬀerent energies should provide information
about gravitational delay as neutrinos are expected to emit within a second in explosions whereas the time diﬀerence
between the emission of the neutrinos and the optical brightening at the source is somewhat controversial. The results
as displayed in Table 2 suggest that owing to the small upper bound mass of νe measuring gravitational time delay
of electron neutrinos caused by DE/DM is only feasible when the gravitating system is local supercluster or even
larger systems. The distance scale involve is few tens of Mpc which should be detectable by the low energy extension
of ICECUBE [38] and some other upcoming/proposed neutrino telescopes and thereby the results found here is also
physically meaningful. For the mentioned scenarios, the ratio of gravitational time delay caused by DM and DE to
the Minkowskian time delay are βro and Λr2
o/6 respectively which numerically equal to ∼ 10−7 and ∼ 10−11 when the
time delay is caused by our galaxy. If the time delay is caused by the local group, these ratios become ∼ 5× 10−6 and
∼ 5× 10−10 respectively and for local supercluster they take the value ∼ 0.16 and ∼ 5× 10−7 respectively. So a good
idea about the source distance is needed to discriminate the DE/DM contribution on time delay from Minkowskian
and pure gravitational time delay.

V. CONCLUSION

We obtain analytical expression for gravitational time delay of particles with non-zero rest mass in presence of
dark energy/matter. We found that a measurement of gravitational time delay involving Mpc distance-scale should
detect the contribution of galactic rotation curve description under conformal gravity as well as dark energy in terms
of cosmological constant. Hence if such a measurement can be realized in future, it should cross check the validity
of the potential linear in radial distance that describes the ﬂat rotation curve of spiral galaxies consistently. The
magnitude of cosmological constant also may be veriﬁed from such measurements. An interesting observation is
that for cosmological constant description of dark energy, the source distance does not appear in the diﬀerence of
arrival time between particles with same mass but diﬀerent energies or between particle with mass m and photon,
but for some other dark energy models such as the DGP braneworld gravity or massive gravity description the stated
diﬀerence of arrival times do contain source distance term and hence can be very large. This feature, therefore, can
distinguish the alternative dark energy models from cosmological constant, at least in principle.

An important question is which particle to be used for gravitational time delay measurement. Probing gravity
through gravitational time delay eﬀect of high energy neutrons originated outside of our solar system is not feasible

9

owing to their short mean life (∼ 15 minutes); even ultra high energy neutrons (> 1018eV) with Lorentz boosted
lifetime would not travel a distance-scale of not more than 10 Kpc. Neutrinos seem the only viable candidate for
the stated purpose. Being weakly interacting particle, neutrino can provide deeper information about both relic
and distant Universe. They are messenger of extreme conditions inside SN cores. Core-collapse SNe both galactic
and extragalactic are predictable rich sources of neutrinos. Despite the fact that till date SN 1987A is the only
detectable SN source of neutrinos, the present generation neutrino detectors e.g., Icecube neutrino telescope, with
certain conditions, might be able to detect SNe beyond 10 Mpc, while furnishing between 10 and 41 regular core-
collapse SN detections per decade. Besides, high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) which plausibly originate from active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), relativistic extragalactic jets or GRBs located mostly at cosmological distances are other
profuse sources of very high energy neutrinos (> Tev range).

A major problem with neutrino, however, is the uncertainty of their mass as well as its small magnitude. So far the
exact mass of any neutrino ﬂavour is not known; experiments provide only the upper bound of its mass. However,
electron neutrino mass is expected to pin down by the future neutrino experiments such as JUNO [39], KATRIN [40].
Also the study of cosmology leads to some useful information on the mass scale of light neutrinos [1]. Moreover, the
lower bound mass of electron neutrino (few meV) may put some constraint on the dark energy parameters from a
high precision gravitational time delay measurements. Conversely, the supernova neutrino observation may put some
restriction on the mass of the neutrinos, particularly muon and tau neutrinos. There are two (model independent)
approaches of measurement of neutrino mass: time-of-ﬂight measurements and precision investigations of weak decays.
Owing to our imprecise knowledge about poin mass, investigation of weak decays put much more looser upper bounds
on the mass of muon and tau neutrinos. The study of neutrinos from the supernova SN1987a in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, employing the time of ﬂight approach yield upper limits of 5.7 eV (95% CL) on electron neutrino mass [41].
Future detection of neutrinos from supernova explosions is expected to improve the stated limit as well as to impose
new limit on masses of muon and tau neutrinos. Obviously the special relativistic term of equations (14)-(17) will
play the dominant role for imposing the mass constraint. The dark matter contribution, being the second largest
contributor, also may be important, particularly when the gravitating system is local super-cluster or super-cluster
and thereby may set the precision limit of the mass determination.

Appendix A

Here we furnish the correction to the gravitational time delay due to the coupling terms to the ﬁrst order
corresponding to DM/DE models in the Eqs. (10) - (17) (i,e., the cross term between M and βi) . As the correction
due to cross terms will not aﬀect the total transit time or the gravitational time delay considerably, here we only
show the expressions (due to algebraic simplicity) considering the source ‘S(R)’ to be situated far away from the
spherical mass distribution about which the signal suﬀers gravitational time delay, i.e., R >> rp, the scenario already
described in §IV after Eq. (19).

Corresponding to n = 1, 2 for DM/DE, the total transit time T1 (ro, R) and T2 (ro, R) and their corresponding grav-
itational time delay will be enhanced considering the coupling terms to the ﬁrst order by the quantity δt1 (ro, R) |βM
and δt2 (ro, R) |ΛM , respectively, given by
