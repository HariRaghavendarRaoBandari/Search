ABSTRACT

The modern deﬁnition of optical coherence highlights a fre-
quency dependent function based on a matrix of spectra and
cross-spectra. Due to general properties of matrices, such a
function is invariant in changes of basis. In this article, we
attempt to measure the proximity of two stationary ﬁelds by a
real and positive number between 0 and 1. The extremal val-
ues will correspond to uncorrelation and linear dependence,
similar to a correlation coefﬁcient which measures linear links
between two random variables. We show that these ”indices
of coherence” are generally not symmetric, and not unique.
We study and we illustrate this problem together for one-
dimensional and two-dimensional ﬁelds in the framework of
stationary processes.

1. INTRODUCTION

Originally, the coherence of an optical beam measured its
ability to interfere. The beam can be modelled by a ”quasi-
monochromatic” one-dimensional process, which means that
the power spectrum is close to a line at some frequency
ω0/2π. We know that a thin spectral line allows a larger num-
ber of franges than a line with a larger width. The spectral
width is related to the auto-correlation function which de-
creases faster when the width increases. In this simple situa-
tion, the coherence γ (τ ) can be deﬁned as the reduced auto-
correlation function, and then takes the value 1 for τ = 0 ,
and the value 0 for large values of τ, except for the ideal
monochromatic wave, which is always an idealization.

When comparing two one-dimensional processes (the
model is now two-dimensional), the ”complex degree of co-
herence” γ12 (τ ) is deﬁned by [1], [2]

(cid:112)K1 (0) K2 (0)

K12 (τ )

γ12 (τ ) =

(1)

where K1, K2, K12 are the auto-correlations and the cross-
correlation between both processes. We have 0 ≤ |γ12 (τ )| ≤
1 by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, but it is possible that

γ12 (τ ) does not reach the value 1, and the maximal value
has a particular sense. Optical beams have a two-dimensional
electrical ﬁeld orthogonal to the trajectory. The ”mutual co-
herence” between two points P1 and P2 is deﬁned from the
”electric mutual coherence matrix” of correlation and cross-
correlation functions [3]

ing the component i (i = 1, 2) of the ﬁeld at the point Pk
(k = 1, 2) in some orthogonal basis. The ”complex degree of
coherence” is deﬁned by (I1 and I2 are the intensities) [2]

γ (τ ) =

trM (τ )
√
I1I2

.

(3)

It is worth noting that this quantity does not depend on the
orthogonal basis of reference because trM (τ ) , I1, I2 are ma-
tricial invariants [4].

Rather than working with correlations, modern optics con-
sider spectral and cross-spectral matrices [3]. The ”spectral
degree of coherence” has the same shape as (3) except that
it is a function of the frequency ω/2π through the ”electric
cross-spectral density”. Whatever the framework, the ”de-
gree” of coherence is a real or complex quantity which may
depend on the time or on the frequency but which may be
constant. It is the case in a number of domains of physical
or human sciences from astrophysics to demography. Here,
its modulus takes the extreme values 0 and 1 in very particu-
lar circumstances of linkage between the processes taken into
account.

Formulas (1) and (3) were ﬁtted to interferences plans. For
values τ0 such that γ12 (τ0) = 1, powers of processes are
added for the delay τ0. Moreover, this means that both pro-
cesses taken into account can be deduced by a linear operation
characterized by a Linear Invariant Filter (LIF) (see the fol-
lowing section). Conversely, if |γ12 (τ )| cannot take the value
1, this means that some parts of both processes are uncorre-
lated, even if other parts are very strongly linked. It is clear
that the latter parts can lead to interferences from matched

devices, but not the ﬁrst parts. Clearly, it is very important to
study this kind of decomposition, and to deduce measures of
”distances” between processes. We will deduce a reasonable
family of ”indices of coherence”.

Let assume that we look at two beams deﬁned by three un-

correlated processes A, B and C. The beams

D = A + B and E = A + C

(4)

can generate good plans of interference only when the
”intensities” of B and C are weak with respect to A. In such
a decomposition, we see the parts which interfere (A with
itself) and the parts which cannot interfere (B with C and A
for instance). Conversely, to provide such a decomposition
gives strong informations on the ability of beams to interfere.
The notion of coherence has to be put in front of neighboor-
hood, proximity, distance, common points between functions,
random variables, random processes, or family of random
processes. In the framework developed here, Hilbert spaces
of random variables and linear algebra allow the simplest the-
oretical developments.

In this article, we look for an ”index of coherence” which
expresses the proximity of some processes. It will be a posi-
tive number between 0 and 1, the extremal values being re-
served to the uncorrelation and the total dependence. The
next section studies the one-dimensional case, where we look
for links between two one-dimensional processes. The third
section provides a generalization to two-dimensional random
processes. Simple examples are developed in both cases. Ap-
pendices recall used mathematical tools and too long proofs.

2. ONE-DIMENSIONAL CASE

2.1. A family of indices of coherence
1) Let U, V be two stationary random processes with elements
U (t) , V (t) , t ∈ R, power spectral densities sU (ω) , sV (ω) ,
cross-spectrum sU V (ω) (see appendix 1). We assume that the
supports of sU (ω) and sV (ω) are identical.
Let consider the linear invariant ﬁlter (LIF) F with com-

plex gain φ (ω) deﬁned by (see appendix 1)

φ (ω) =

(cid:20) sV U

(cid:21)
(cid:26) A (t) = F [U] (t)

sU

(ω) .

V (t) = A (t) + B (t)

When the processes A and B verify

where HU is the Hilbert space of linear combinations of the
U (t) when t spans R (see appendix 2).

(cid:104)|A (t)|2(cid:105)

(cid:104)|B (t)|2(cid:105)

Formula (6) splits V (t) into two parts, the ﬁrst one A (t)
which belongs to HU (it is a linear combination of the
U (u) , u ∈ R), and the second one B (t) which is orthogonal
to HU (i.e. uncorrelated with the U (u) , u ∈ R).

is weak compared to E

In decomposition (6), V and U are ”neighbouring” when
, which is
E
equivalent to a strong ”coherence” between them. Con-
versely, the ”coherence” is weak when this ratio is too large.
In this context, the ”distance” between V and U is not deﬁned
by a accurate relation taking into account the r.v. U (t) and
V (t) , but a ”distance” between for instance U (t) and HV
(spanned by the set V (u) , u ∈ R). These considerations al-
low to deﬁne ”indices of coherence” which are constants and
not some functions of the time or the frequency. Let consider
ρU V deﬁned by

ρU V =

ρU V = 0 ⇐⇒ V (t) ⊥ HU .

sU

We have ρU V ∈ [0, 1] , and

(8)

(9)

(ω) dω

In the ﬁrst case, the process V can be (linearly) reconstructed
from U, and both processes U and V are orthogonal in the
second case. A (t) is the part of V (t) which is explained by
U i.e. by the set of random variables U (u) , u ∈ R together
than ρU V is a measure of the part of the power of V (t) which
is explained by U.

2) In the case ρU V = 1 (B = 0), both processes are ”co-
herent” (U deﬁnes completely V and conversely), and ”un-
coherent” when ρU V = 0 (U and V are orthogonal). For
ρU V (cid:54)= 0 and 1, they are ”partially coherent”. It is useless
to add the redundant terms ”totally” or ”completely” or other
qualiﬁers [5], [6]. Clearly, ρU V has the qualities that we ex-
pect for an ”index of coherence”. The fact that ρU V is de-
duced from a perfectly deﬁned orthogonal decomposition is a
strong supplementary argument. It is worth noting that, using
(6) , (7)

ρG[U]V = ρU V

(10)
where G is some LIF (with complex gain which does not can-
cel). This equality shows that ρU V measures the proximity
of HU with V (t) . We obtain the same value of the index of
coherence whatever the stationary process chosen in HU .

Unfortunately, this index is not symmetric, except for the

bounds 0 and 1. We have

This quantity has no reason to cancel, except if we add hy-
potheses, for instance the equality of the normalized spectra.
Moreover, the family of ρa deﬁned by

ρa = aρU V + (1 − a) ρV U

(11)

veriﬁes the conditions above when a ∈ [0, 1] . Then, it is
easy to construct families of positive numbers which illus-
trate links between two stationary processes. Obviously, ρ1/2
is symmetric, and it is the only one symmetric provided that
ρU V (cid:54)= ρV U .

3) Now, let assume that the support of sU (and sV ) can be

split in the sets ∆ and ∆(cid:48) of positive measure such that

(cid:26) sU V (ω) = 0, ω ∈ ∆

sU V (ω) (cid:54)= 0, ω ∈ ∆(cid:48).

In decomposition (6) we have at the same time

(cid:40)

(cid:104)|sV U|2

(cid:105)

sA (ω) =

sU

sA (ω) > 0, ω ∈ ∆(cid:48)

(ω) = 0, ω ∈ ∆

which implies 0 < ρU V < 1. By symmetry, it is the same for
ρV U . Obviously, we ﬁnd the same result when the supports of
sU and sV are distinct.

4) Let assume that U and V model an optical beam, where a
source, a direction and a sense of propagation are given. If U
is nearer the source than V, the decomposition (6) is natural,
because we can consider that U is a source for V. In the latter,
we expect to ﬁnd a component closely linked to U added to
a noise which models a loss of information. A and B answer
this question. This point of view is accurately expressed by
(7) and by the index ρU V of (8) rather than by ρV U based on
a decomposition of U (t) .

Whatever the deﬁnition of the index of coherence, based
on the decomposition of one or both processes U and V, it is
clear that the decomposition itself in two processes (for in-
stance A and B) gives more insights about links between the
processes than any index only based on statistical moments.
When the beam is not reduced to a ray but ﬁlls some volume
close to some axis, the relative places of the processes are
more difﬁcult to characterize.

To summarize, we have deﬁned a real and positive index
ρU V which takes its values in [0, 1] and which expresses
the proximity between U and V. We will say that both pro-
cesses are ”coherent” when ρU V = 1, and ”uncoherent”
when ρU V = 0 (rather than fully or completely coherent or
uncoherent). In other cases, they will be ”partially coherent”.
Actually, through (11) , we have shown that ρU V and ρV U
deﬁne a family of indices ρa (0 ≤ a ≤ 1) with the same
properties, added to the symmetry property for ρ1/2.

2.2. Estimation and index of coherence
When the LIF F−1 is well deﬁned, (6) is equivalent to

 W (t) = F−1 [V] (t) = U (t) + C (t)

C (t) = F−1 [B] (t)
U (t) = F−1 [A] (t) .

Both processes U and C are uncorrelated. We look for an
estimation of U from the observation of V (equivalently from
the observation of W). The ”Wiener ﬁlter” N with input W,

output (cid:101)U and complex gain η (ω) , is classically deﬁned by

η =

The normalized error is

This last equality links the index of coherence ρV U with the
relative error in the mean-square estimation of the process
U from the observation of the process V. The errorless re-
construction corresponds to ρV U = 1, and the worse one to
ρV U = 0, as expected.

2.3. Another symmetric index of coherence

The ”spectral degree of coherence at the frequency f” of a
scalar ﬁeld is currently deﬁned by [2], [7] p. 170,

(cid:34)|sU V |2

(cid:35)

sU sV

µ0

U V (ω) =

(ω)

which depends on the frequency f = ω/2π. The quantity
which is sought herein is a constant. The usual method for
reaching this aim is an integration on the frequency axis. But
nothing can assert that

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

µ1

U V =

µ0

U V (ω) dω

veriﬁes the conditions veriﬁed by ρU V . As an example,
U V = ∞ in example 1 of section 2.4.1 with
µ1
sU (ω) = e−|ω|, sN (ω) = e−2|ω|.

For an index which has to characterize a global behavior,
the places which hold a larger power have to be emphazised.

For instance, if we weight the integral which deﬁnes µ1
sV /σ2

V , we obtain the ﬁnite index deﬁned in (8)

U V by

(cid:3) (ω) dω

U V sV

but this index is not symmetric (ρU V (cid:54)= ρV U most of the
time). The symmetry condition is veriﬁed by

because µU V is a real and positive quantity such that 0 ≤
µU V ≤ 1, µU V = 0 if and only if sU V = 0 (U and V are
uncoherent), and µU V = 1 if and only if U and V are coher-
ent. When µU V is different from 0 and 1, it is also true for
ρU V and ρV U . The values of these last quantities are linked
to some information held by the process U about V (t) (or the
converse) through mean-square estimations. We do not have
such a meaning for µU V , which is only built to fulﬁll some
mathematical conditions of normalization and symmetry.

2.4. Examples

2.4.1. Example 1

The simplest model of transmission veriﬁes

V = U + N

where N is a ”noise” uncorrelated with the ”signal” U. About
the decomposition (6) , we ﬁnd (in accordance with intuition)

U = A, N = B

which leads to the index of coherence

ρU V =

U

σ2
U + σ2

The converse is different. ρV U is obtained from the equations
(we rewrite (5) , (6) , (8) inverting U and V)

 φ = sU V

In both situations, we ﬁnd 1 and 0 as limits following the
”ratio” between the ”signal” and the ”noise”. Between these
limits, values of ρU V and ρV U are generally different. As an
example, let assume that (a > 0)

(cid:26) sN (ω) = 1 − |ω| , ω ∈ (−1, 1) and 0 elsewhere
which yields(cid:40) ρU V = 2a

∞), and are not very different for other values of a.

2.4.2. Example 2
Let X be a real process independent of U with characteristic
functions (in the probability calculus sense)

β (τ, ω) = E(cid:2)e−iω(X(t)−X(t−τ )(cid:3)

independent of t, which implies that X is stationary in a sense
stronger than the usual second order one. We deﬁne V by

V (t) = U (t − X (t)) .

X (t) models a random propagation time which can take into
account variations of
the refraction index or other hazards

and ρV U in function of a for λ = 4, 8, 16. As explained
above, ρU V and ρV U are not equal (except for the value 1).

The lack of symmetry is obvious when spectral supports are
not identical. Let assume that sV (ω) does not cancel and
that U is the the result of the low-pass ﬁlter with input V, and
complex gain

In this case, with respect to (6) , we have A = U and B is the
output of a high-pass ﬁlter with input V, and complex gain

Both quantities have no reason to be equal. Moreover, U de-
ﬁnes V, which, in the linear context, is equivalent to B=0 in

formation (the sign function) is nonlinear. This function is not
bijective (V gives few informations about U), but it is not the
reason for the small value of ρU V .

ear tools. The property of ”coherence” depends on the used
mathematical tools. In this example, both processes are ”par-
tially coherent” in the linear framework, but ”coherent” in a
wider context.

2.4.5. Example 5

It can happen that 0 < ρU V = ρV U < 1. It is the case when

U = X + N, V = X + M

where X and (N, M) are uncorrelated with sM = sN (the
processes are assumed real and different from 0).

3. TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE

We know that an optical beam is deﬁned by a support,
a direction of propagation and an electrical ﬁeld orthog-
onal to this direction.
In this section, we consider two-
dimensional processes U = (Ux, Uy) and V = (Vx, Vy)
where the components are taken with respect to an orthog-
onal system Oxyz where Oz is the direction of propagation.
The four-dimensional process (Ux, Uy, Vx, Vy) is assumed
globally stationary with spectral and cross-spectral densities
sUx , ..., sVy , sUxUy , ... and identical spectral supports. We
have to deﬁne an ”index of coherence” between 0 and 1,
which measures the proximity of the two-dimensional ﬁelds
U and V, and which does not depend on the system of coor-
dinates Oxy. As done previously, we will deduce from one
particular index a natural family of available indices of coher-

3.1. A deﬁnition of the index of coherence
As in section 2, we look for the part of V=(Vx, Vy) which
is explained by U=(Ux, Uy). As proved in appendix 3, we
have the following decomposition of V

 Vx = V(cid:48)

V (cid:48)
x (t) , V (cid:48)
V (cid:48)(cid:48)
x (t) , V (cid:48)(cid:48)

x + V(cid:48)(cid:48)

x, Vy = V(cid:48)

y + V(cid:48)(cid:48)
y (t) ∈ HUx + HUy
y (t) ⊥ HUx + HUy

y

(15)

where an element of the set HUx + HUy is the addition of
an element of HUx with an element of HUy (they are the
Hilbert spaces spanned by both processes Ux, Uy). V (cid:48)
x (t) for
instance is a linear combination of the Ux (u) and the Uy (v) ,
and is, in the mean-square sense, the quantity that we can con-
struct from these r.v. and which is the nearest to Vx (t) . The
parts V(cid:48)
y hold informations about Ux and Uy and not
V(cid:48)(cid:48)
x and V(cid:48)(cid:48)
y .

Consequently, V (cid:48)

estimations of Vx (t) and Vy (t) on HUx + HUy . A reasonable
deﬁnition of the index of coherence ρU V between U and V is
given by

and, obviously, as expected, we have ρU V ∈ [0, 1] , with

As explained in section 2, the deﬁnition has no reason to be
symmetric (generally ρU V (cid:54)= ρV U ) and a more general index
of coherence ρa can be deﬁned:

ρa = aρU V + (1 − a) ρV U

(19)
where a ∈ [0, 1] . Like in section 2, we remark that ρ1/2 is
a”symmetric index of coherence”, and it is the only one pro-
vided that ρU V (cid:54)= ρV U .

cesses Ux and Uy are V (cid:48)

◦c (ω) is a complex quantity such that 0 ≤ |◦c (ω)| ≤ 1. The
maximum value is obtained only when

which is a condition which separates the coordinates. Now,
let assume that

Ux (t) = Vx (t) , Uy (t) = 3Vy (t) .

We verify that ◦c (ω) < 1. U and V are ”coherent” in the
sense where either of them deﬁnes the other (and by linear
operations which can be infered). We ﬁnd the same result
when

Ux (t) = Vy (t) , Uy (t) = 3Vx (t)

We have the same drawback for instance when
Ux (t) = Vy (t) , Uy (t) = −Vx (t)

which can correspond to some rotation of a beam.
In this
case, we have ◦c (ω) = 0 when the processes Ux and Uy are
uncorrelated, thought U deﬁnes V perfectly. We see through
these simple examples that the notion of ”coherence” that is
used in this paper is different from the notion deﬁned by (22) .

3.4. Examples

3.4.1. Example 1

Let consider the simple model

V = U + N

where N=(Nx, Ny) models an unpolarized beam, which
means that

sNx = sNy , sNxNy = 0

in any orthonormal basis [5], [6]. If N is uncorrelated with U,
we have, with respect to (15)

3.4.2. Example 2

We consider the model

(cid:26) Vx (t) = Ux (t − X (t))

Vy (t) = Uy (t − X (t))

where X is deﬁned section 2.4.2 by (13). This means that
the propagation is delayed by a quantity which is random and
identical for both components. The processes Vx and Vy can
be decomposed following the sums [8]

(cid:26) Vx (t) = Gx (t) + Yx (t)

(24)

Vy (t) = Gy (t) + Yy (t)

where Gx and Gy are the outputs of LIF with respective in-
puts Ux and Uy and the same complex gain α (ω) . Yx is un-
correlated together with Gx and Gy. The same property is
true for Yy. Consequently,

Yx (t) , Yy (t) ⊥ HUx + HUy .

When considering

we no longer have

U = V − N

U(cid:48) = V, U(cid:48)(cid:48) = −N

because, for instance

E [Nx (t) V ∗

x (u)] = E [Nx (t) N∗

x (u)]

has no reason to cancel, and then we do not have

Nx, Ny⊥HVx + HVy .

The calculus of ρV U is tedious. We obtain, from (16)

i.e. for small variations of the propagation time, and the co-

time (and then for large θ). Computations are harder for ρV U ,
but are possible, knowing the Fourier transforms of

3.4.3. Example 3
When HVx +HVy is included in HUx +HUy, it is clear that
Vx (t) and Vy (t) can be retrieved from (Ux, Uy) which is
equivalent to ρU V = 1. For instance, it is the case when

(cid:26) Vx (t) = D [Ux] (t) + E [Uy] (t)

Vy (t) = F [Ux] (t) − G [Uy] (t)

(27)
where D, E, F, G are well-deﬁned LIF. Conversely, ρV U =
1 if and only when the linear system (27) can be inverted
which is not always possible. For instance, let assume that the
four ﬁlters are bandpass on (−a, a) . We have (with notations

similar to section 3.1)(cid:26) U(cid:48)

Vy (t) = Y (t) (cos θ + sin θ) + Ny (t)

for any θ, following the properties of invariance by rotation.

3.4.5. Example 5

Finally, let Vx, Vy be two real processes, and Ux, Uy the cor-
responding analytic signals [10]. This means that for instance
(the integral is deﬁned in the Cauchy sense)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

Ux (t) = Vx (t) + i

Vx (u)

We know that the analytic signal loses the negative part of the
power spectrum and we easily ﬁnd the formulas

(cid:26) sUx (ω) = 4sVx (ω) , sUy (ω) = 4sVy (ω)

sUxUy (ω) = 4sVxVy (ω) , ω > 0

and 0 for ω < 0. Obviously, ρV U = 1. But Vx (t) and Vy (t)
are the real parts of Ux (t) and Uy (t) and then the former
(real) processes can be deduced from the latter (complex) pro-
cesses. Nevertheless, the operation which transforms a com-
plex function in its real part is not linear, which explains why
ρU V < 1. Actually, we ﬁnd ρU V = 1/2, using (16) and (18).
This last example shows the limitations of linear tools, as ex-
plained section 2.4.4.

4. CONCLUSION

The coherence of a ﬁeld can be deﬁned as a measure of the
proximity between some properties measured at two points of
the ﬁeld. If the ﬁeld is reduced to only one random variable
at each point of the space, a correlation coefﬁcient depending
on coordinates of any couple of points may be a good mea-
sure of coherence, the values 0 and 1 addressing the lack of
dependence and, conversely, the complete dependence. When
the ﬁeld is characterized by one-dimensional stationary pro-
cesses (for instance X and Y at two points), the normalized
cross-correlation (1) is a natural measure of dependence of
X (t − τ ) on Y (t) , though the latter may be inﬂuenced by
the entire set of the X (u) , u ∈ R, and not only by the value
X (t − τ ) of X at t−τ. If the entire process X is observed, and
assuming the stationarity property, formula (1) does not pro-
vide the whole available information held by X about the el-
ements of Y. A positive number which measures global links
between X (t) and the entire process Y (or the converse) ap-
pears to be a better characterization of proximity of both pro-

cesses. It seems equivalent looking for a copy (cid:101)X of X from

Y (an estimation of X (t) on the entire set of the Y (u)) and
conversely, which is an usual procedure in communications.
Obviously, the idea of coherence is linked to the similarity be-
tween the model and the copy. At the next stage, we compute
a distance (the error) between both and we deﬁne an index
of coherence normalizing the latter. We have explained the
main drawback of this construction: it leads to a different in-
dex when X and Y are inverted. Nevertheless, this enables the
deﬁnition of an available linear family of indices. We show
that other constructions can be achieved which lead to a sym-
metric index of coherence. When the ﬁeld is no longer one-
dimensional but two-dimensional, deﬁnitions are generalized.
The main idea is unchanged, which looks for characterizing a
kind of distance between Hilbert spaces respectively spanned
by each of two-dimensional processes. The resulting ”index
of coherence” is still a number between 0 and 1 as expected
and not some function of time or frequency. Examples are
given to cover a sufﬁcient number of situations, and appen-
dices summarize the main results of the stationary process
theory, and detail laborious calculations.

in HU

Let assume that A (t) is the orthogonal projection of V (t) on
HU :

A (t) = prHU

V (t) .

This means that V (t) − A (t) is orthogonal to any U (u) (the
r.v. which generate HU ) :

E [(V (t) − A (t)) U∗ (u)] = 0

We consider three stationary processes Z, W, C. We as-
sume that (Z, W) is stationary, that C has stationary corre-
lations with (Z, W) and that C (t) ∈ HZ + HW (which
means that C (t) is the result of linear operations from Z
and W). We have to justify the drawings of ﬁgure 4, where
µ (ω) , α (ω) , β (ω) , γ (ω) are complex gains of LIF to be
characterized. sZ, sZW ... are the spectral densities and the
cross-spectra.

Using (29) and (30) we obtain

βt (ω) = eiωt

sCW sZ − sCZsZW
sW sZ − |sZW|2

which proves that C2 is the output of a LIF B with input D
and complex gain

β (ω) =

sCW sZ − sCZsZW
sW sZ − |sZW|2

(ω) .

Figure 4 depicts a symmetric equivalent circuit which high-
lights the LIF of complex gain γ (ω) with
sCZsW − sCW sW Z
sW sZ − |sZW|2

γ (ω) =

As a consequence, the power spectrum sC veriﬁes

(cid:104)|sCZ|2sW +|sCW |2sZ−2R[sCW sW Z sZC ]

sC (ω) =
sW sZ−|sW Z|2

(cid:105)

Moreover, the symmetric scheme is unique, provided that the
set of ω such that

|sZW| (ω) (cid:54)=

√

sZsW (ω)

has a positive measure.
4) If C and C(cid:48) have stationary correlations with (Z, W)
and belong to HZ + HW , then (C, C(cid:48)) is stationary and with

sCC(cid:48) (ω) =

a (ω) = [sW sZC(cid:48) − sZW sW C(cid:48)] (ω)
b (ω) = [sZsW C(cid:48) − sW ZsZC(cid:48)] (ω) .

(30)

To summarize, if C and C(cid:48) are stationarily correlated with Z
and W and belong to HZ + HW , they are the outputs of a
”bi-ﬁlter” with perfectly determined components.
5) When the hypothesis C (t) ∈ HZ + HW is suppressed,

we have the decomposition

C2 (t) = prHD

C (t) .

By construction, HZ and HD are orthogonal and HC ⊂ HZ
+HW by hypothesis, which implies

C (t) = C1 (t) + C2 (t) .

The problem is to prove that C2 is the output of a LIF. If
C2 (t) ←→ID βt (ω) , we have

−∞ e−iωu(cid:2)eiωtφ (ω) − [βtsD] (ω)(cid:3) dω = 0.
(cid:82) ∞

E [(C (t) − C2 (t)) D∗ (u)] = 0 ⇐⇒

φ (ω) = [sCW − µ∗sCZ] (ω)

C (t) = C(cid:48) (t) + C(cid:48)(cid:48) (t)
C(cid:48) (t) = prHZ +HW
C (t)
C(cid:48)(cid:48) (t) ⊥ HZ + HW .

C(cid:48) is stationarily correlated with (Z, W) because

E(cid:2)C(cid:48) (t) [aZ + bW ]

∗

(u)(cid:3) = [aKCZ + bKCW ] (t − u) .

As a consequence, the drawings in ﬁgure 4 are available, re-
placing C by C(cid:48) as output (but with the same complex gains
µ, α, β, γ).
