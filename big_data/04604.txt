LOCALIZATION OF THE INTERIOR TRANSMISSION EIGENVALUES

FOR A BALL

VESSELIN PETKOV AND GEORGI VODEV

Abstract. We study the localization of the interior transmission eigenvalues (ITEs) in the case
when the domain is the unit ball {x ∈ Rd : |x| ≤ 1}, d ≥ 2, and the coeﬃcients cj (x), j = 1, 2,
and the indices of refraction nj (x), j = 1, 2, are constants near the boundary |x| = 1. We prove
that in this case the eigenvalue-free region obtained in [16] for strictly concave domains can be
signiﬁcantly improved. In particular, if cj (x), nj (x), j = 1, 2 are constants for |x| ≤ 1, we show
that all (ITEs) lie in a strip |Im λ| ≤ C.

Key words: Interior transmission eigenvalues, eigenvalue-free regions, Dirichlet-to-Neumann

map, Bessel functions

1. Introduction and statement of the result

Let Ω ⊂ Rd, d ≥ 2, be a bounded, connected domain with a C ∞ smooth boundary Γ = ∂Ω.
A complex number λ with Re λ > 0 will be called interior transmission eigenvalue (ITE) if the
following problem has a non-trivial solution:

(cid:0)∇c1(x)∇ + λ2n1(x)(cid:1) u1 = 0 in Ω,
(cid:0)∇c2(x)∇ + λ2n2(x)(cid:1) u2 = 0 in Ω,

u1 = u2, c1∂νu1 = c2∂νu2 on Γ,

(1.1)



where ν denotes the exterior Euclidean unit normal to Γ and cj(x), nj(x) ∈ C ∞(Ω), j = 1, 2,
are strictly positive real-valued functions.
The (ITEs) were ﬁrst studied by Kirsch [6] and by Colton and Monk [2] in the context of
inverse scattering problems. It was shown that the (ITEs) correspond to the frequencies for
which the reconstruction algorithm in inverse scattering based on the so-called linear sampling
methods breaks down. This attracted the attention of many researchers and the number of
publications devoted to the (ITEs) considerably increased in the recent ten years. The reader
may consult the survey [1] for a complete list of references and historical remarks.

It is well-known (e.g. see [14]) that there exists a closed non-symmetric operator, A, associ-
ated in a natural way to the problem (1.1), such that the possible (ITEs) can be considered as
eigenvalues of A. The analysis of the (ITEs) leads to following three problems:

(A) Prove the discreteness of the spectrum of A in C;
(B) Find eigenvalue-free regions in C;
(C) Establish a Weyl formula for the counting function of all (ITEs)

N (r) = #{λj is (ITE),

|λj| ≤ r}.

Note that the problem (A) is now relatively well studied (see [8], [13], [10], [4] and the references
therein). In fact, the problem (A) is reduced to that one of showing that the resolvent of A is
meromorphic with residues of ﬁnite rank. On the other hand, this is true (see [14]) if the inverse
of the operator T (λ) introduced in Section 4 is meromorphic. The latter fact can be proved if
the parametrix of the operator T (λ) in the deep elliptic zone is invertible.

The problems (B) and (C) are more diﬃcult, and they are of some interest for the numerical
analysis of the (ITEs).
In this direction it is interesting to ﬁnd an optimal eigenvalue-free
region and a Weyl formula with optimal remainder. In a recent work [14] the authors showed
that (B) and (C) are closely related each other, and a larger eigenvalue-free region leads to a
Weyl asymptotics with a smaller remainder term. More precisely, the remainder is Oε(rd−κ+ε),
∀ 0 < ε ≪ 1, where 0 < κ ≤ 1 is such that there are no (ITEs) in

nλ ∈ C : Re λ > 1, |Im λ| ≥ C (Re λ)1−κo .

The present paper is devoted to the problem (B). More precisely, we are interested in ﬁnding
as small as possible neighbourhoods of the real axis containing all (ITEs). The ﬁrst result of
this type was obtained in [5] assuming n1(x) > 1 in ¯Ω and n2(x) ≡ 1, c1(x) ≡ c2(x) ≡ 1. For
domains Ω with arbitrary geometry, it has been shown in [15] that under the condition (isotropic
case)

c1(x) ≡ c2(x),

∂νc1(x) ≡ ∂νc2(x), n1(x) 6= n2(x) on Γ,

or the condition (anisotropic case)

there are no (ITEs) in the region

(c1(x) − c2(x))(c1(x)n1(x) − c2(x)n2(x)) < 0

The localization of the (ITEs) has been recently studied in [16] in the case when the boundary

∀ 0 < ε ≪ 1.

(1.4)

The approach in [15] and [16] is based on the construction of a semi-classical parametrix near
the boundary for the problem

((h2∇c(x)∇ + zn(x))u = 0

on Γ,

u = f

in Ω,

(1.5)

where 0 < h ≪ 1 is a semi-classical parameter and z ∈ C with Re z = 1. For domains with
arbitrary geometry the parametrix construction for (1.5) works for |Im z| ≥ h1/2−ǫ, 0 < ǫ ≪ 1,
while for strictly concave domains, by a more complicated construction, one can cover the region
|Im z| ≥ h1−ǫ. It is a challenging problem to construct a semi-classical parametrix for (1.5) when
|Im z| ≥ Ch, C ≫ 1 being a constant.
The purpose of the present paper is to improve the eigenvalue-free region (1.4) in the case
when the domain is the unit ball in Rd, d ≥ 2. Given a parameter 0 < δ ≪ 1, denote Ω(δ) =
{x ∈ Ω : dist(x, Γ) ≤ δ}. Our main result is the following
Theorem 1.1. Let Ω = {x ∈ Rd :
|x| ≤ 1}, d ≥ 2, and suppose that there is a constant
0 < δ0 ≪ 1 such that the functions cj(x), nj(x), j = 1, 2, are constants in Ω(δ0). Assume also

either the condition (1.2) or the condition (1.3). Then, there is a constant C > 0 such that there
are no (IT Es) in the region

If in addition the functions cj , nj, j = 1, 2, are constants everywhere in Ω, then there are no
(IT Es) in a larger region of the form

{λ ∈ C : Re λ > 1, |Im λ| ≥ C log (Re λ)}.

(1.6)

{λ ∈ C : Re λ > 1, |Im λ| ≥ C} .

(1.7)
Remark 1. The eigenvalue-free region (1.6) is still valid if we add a compact cavity K ⊂ Ω
and consider the equation (1.1) in Ω \ K with Dirichlet condition on ∂K.
Indeed, the only
fact needed for our argument is the coercivity of the corresponding Dirichlet realization (see the
operator GD in Section 3), and this is used only in the proof of Lemma 3.4 below.



It is clear from the proof that the fact that the boundary Γ is a sphere is not

essential.
In other words, the eigenvalue-free regions (1.6) and (1.7) are still valid for any
Riemannian manifold Ω = (0, 1) × Γ with metric g = dr2 + r2σ, where r ∈ (0, 1), and (Γ, σ)
is an arbitrary d − 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary, the metric σ being
independent of r.
In the isotropic case when cj ≡ 1, j = 1, 2 and n1 = 1, n2 6= 1 constant, the eigenvalue-free
region (1.7) has been established in the one-dimensional case Ω = {x ∈ R : |x| ≤ 1} (see [13],
[10]). Moreover, the case of the ball {x ∈ Rd :
|x| ≤ 1}, d = 2, 3, and radial refraction indices
have been studied in [8], [3], [4], where spherical symmetric eigenfunctions depending only on
the radial variable r = |x| has been considered. For example, the analysis of such eigenfunctions
in R3 leads to the following one-dimensional problem
r u′ + λ2n(r)u = 0,
r v′ + λ2v = 0,

0 < r < 1,

0 < r < 1,

(1.8)

u′′ + 2
v′′ + 2
u(1) = v(1), u′(1) = v′(1),

where n(r) is a strictly positive function. Among other things, it was shown in [4] that if n(1) = 1
and n′(1) or n′′(1) is non-zero, then there may exist inﬁnitely many complex eigenvalues of the
problem (1.8) lying outside any strip parallel to the real axis. This example shows that in the
isotropic case the condition n(1) 6= 1 (resp. (1.2)) is important to have an eigenvalue-free region
like (1.7).
However, to study all (ITEs) and all eigenfunctions, one has to consider a family of inﬁnitely
many one-dimensional problems. Such an analysis is carried out in [10] in the isotropic case
when the domain is the ball {x ∈ Rd : |x| ≤ 1}, d ≥ 1, and
cj ≡ 1, n1 ≡ 1, n2 ≡ γ 6= 1.

Fν (λ) = γJν (λ)J ′

In this case the (ITEs) are the zeros in C of the family of functions
ν = l + d/2 − 1,
ν (λ),
where Jν denotes the Bessel function of order ν.
It has been proved in [10] that there are
inﬁnitely many real (ITEs) whose counting function has a Weyl asymptotics. When d = 1 a
Weyl asymptotics for the counting function of all (ITEs) is also obtained.

ν (γλ) − Jν (γλ)J ′

l = 0, 1, 2, ...,

To prove Theorem 1.1 we follow the same strategy as in [15], [16], which consists of deriving the
eigenvalue-free region from some approximation properties of the interior Dirichlet-to-Neumann
map (DN). Recall that the interior DN map is a meromorphic operator-valued function, which
maps H 1(Γ) into L2(Γ), with poles lying on the positive real axis. Thus, the eigenvalue-free
region turns out to be the region in which the DN map can be approximated by a simpler

4

operator of the form f (∆Γ), where f is a complex-valued function and ∆Γ denotes the negative
Laplace-Beltrami operator on the boundary Γ equipped with the Riemannian metric induced by
the Euclidean one. With such an approximation in hands, the problem of proving the eigenvalue-
free region is transformed into the much simpler one of inverting complex-valued functions, which
in turn is done using the conditions (1.2) or (1.3) (see Section 4). Therefore, a large portion of the
present paper is devoted to the study of the interior DN map in the case when Ω is a ball. In the
case when the coeﬃcients are constants everywhere in the domain we can express the DN map in
terms of the Bessel functions. We then use the asymptotic expansions of these functions in terms
of the Airy function to get the desired approximation (see Theorem 3.1). Of course, we cannot
proceed in this way when the coeﬃcients are supposed constants only in a neighbourhood of the
boundary. In this latter case we show that the DN map can be approximated by the DN map
associated to the corresponding problem with constant coeﬃcients everywhere and for which we
have an explicit expression in terms of the Bessel functions (see Lemma 3.4).

We expect that the eigenvalue-free regions (1.6) and (1.7) are still true for more general
strictly concave domains, but this is hard to prove because the available semi-classical parametrix
constructions for the DN map lead to the existence of smaller regions (see [16]). We also
conjecture that (1.7) is optimal for a ball and constant coeﬃcients, but this seems diﬃcult to
prove.

2. Some properties of the Bessel functions

We begin this section by recalling some basic properties of the Bessel functions Jν(z) of real

order ν ≥ 0 (e.g. see [9]). The function Jν (z) satisﬁes the equation

Then the function bν (z) = z1/2Jν (z) satisﬁes the equation

where 0 < κ < 1 is a parameter independent of z. Set also ρ(z) = √z2 − 1 with Re ρ > 0. Our
goal in this section is to prove the following

δ1Re λ, ν ≥ 0, we have the estimate

(1 + ν/|λ|)|ψν(λ) − ρ(ν/λ)| ≤ δ.

(1 + ν/|λ|)|ην (λ)| + |eην (λ)| ≤ C ′|λ|1/3e−C|Im λ|.

Proof. Observe ﬁrst that, in view of the formula eην (λ) = ψν (κλ)ην (λ), the bound for |eην (λ)|

follows from that one for |ην(λ)| and the fact that (2.1) implies the bound |ψν (κλ)| ≤ C(1+ν/|λ|).
To prove (2.1) we will consider several cases.

By using the above inequalities, we get

Case 2. ν ≫ 1. We set z = λ/ν. Then 1/ν ≪ |Im z| ≪ Re z. In this case we will use the
asymptotic expansions of the Bessel functions in terms of the Airy function Ai(σ). Recall ﬁrst
that Ai(σ) has the expansion

will use that Ai(−σ) = Ai+(σ) + Ai−(σ), where Ai±(σ) = e±πi/3Ai(cid:0)σe±πi/3(cid:1). By (2.5), for

using that if | arg σ| ≤ ε, Im σ > 0, then −σ ∈ C \ Λε and (−σ)1/2 = −iσ1/2. The analysis of

where the branches take their principal values when z ∈ (0, 1), ϕ, ζ ∈ (0, +∞), and are continu-

The ﬁrst derivatives of ϕ(z) and ζ(z) satisfy

Θ0(δ, δ1) =(cid:8)1 − δ2 ≤ Re z ≤ 1 + δ2, 0 < |Im z| ≤ δ1Re z(cid:9) .

The next lemma is more or less well-known and follows from the properties of the functions ϕ
and ζ studied in [9]. We will sketch the proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 2.3. For every 0 < δ ≪ 1 there is δ1 = δ1(δ) > 0 such that the following properties
hold: For z ∈ Θ1(δ, δ1) we have | arg ζ(z)| = π − O(δ), and

(2.18)
with a constant C > 0 depending on δ. For z ∈ Θ2(δ, δ1) we have | arg ζ(z)| = O(δ). For
z ∈ Θ0(δ, δ1) we have
(2.19)

2|ζ(z)|1/2|Im ζ(z)| ≥ |Re ϕ(z)| ≥ C|Im z|

|Im ζ(z)| ≥ |Im z|.

Proof. We will use the formula

Let z ∈ Θ1(δ, δ1). Then

In this case we also have

Re ϕ(Re z) = 0,

Im ϕ(Re z) ≥ CδRe z.

ϕ′(Re z + iτ Im z) = Oδ(1)

and, in view of (2.16), if ±Im z > 0,

±Im ϕ′(Re z + iτ Im z) ≥ Cδ − Oδ(δ1) ≥ Cδ/2 > 0,

provided δ1 is taken small enough. Thus, by (2.20) we get
−Re ϕ(z) ≥ Cδ|Im z|,

±Im ϕ(z) ≥ (Cδ − Oδ(δ1))Re z ≥ 2−1CδRe z, ±Im z > 0.

This yields Re (∓iϕ(z)) > 0, ±Im (∓iϕ(z)) > 0, and hence 0 < ± arg(∓iϕ(z)) = Oδ(δ1) = O(δ)

provided δ1 is taken small enough. Therefore, by (2.20) we get

|Im ϕ(z)| ≤ Cδ |Im z|

Re z

= Oδ(δ1),

Re ϕ(z) = Re ϕ(Re z) + Oδ(|Im z|) ≥ Cδ − Oδ(δ1) ≥ Cδ/2.

Hence, arg ϕ(z) = Oδ(δ1) = O(δ), which yields

arg ζ(z) =

arg ϕ(z) = O(δ).

Let z ∈ Θ0(δ, δ1). Then we have ζ ′(z) = −21/3 + O(|1 − z|) at z = 1. To prove (2.19) we will
use the formula

For | arg z| ≤ ε, ν → +∞, we have the expansion (see [9]):

for every integer M ≫ 1, where the functions As(ζ), Bs(ζ) are smooth and bounded with their

ℓ = 0, 1.

(2.22)

We will derive now a similar expansion for the ﬁrst derivative of Jν . To this end, observe ﬁrst
that by (2.15) we have

Since |ζ| ∼ |z| as |z| → ∞, |ζ| ∼ log(|z|−1) as |z| → 0, ζ(z) = 21/3(1 − z) + O(|1 − z|2) as z → 1,

|Im z| ≫ ν−1 implies ν|Re ϕ(z)| ≫ 1. Therefore, in this case we can use the estimates (2.9),

3. Some properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map

Let Ω = {x ∈ Rd : |x| ≤ 1}, Γ = ∂Ω and let λ ∈ C with 1 ≪ |Im λ| ≪ Re λ. Given a function

f ∈ H s+1(Γ), let u solve the equation

( (cid:0)∆ + λ2(cid:1) u = 0 in Ω,

on Γ,

u = f

where ∆ is the negative Euclidean Laplacian. Then the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map

is deﬁned by

N0(λ) : H s+1(Γ) → H s(Γ)

N0(λ)f := λ−1∂νu|Γ

12

ν being the unit normal to Γ. Let ∆Γ be the negative Laplace-Beltrami operator on the
boundary Γ equipped with the Riemannian metric induced by the Euclidean one.
In what
follows the Sobolev space H 1(Γ) will be equipped with the semi-classical norm kfkH 1(Γ) =
k(I − |λ|−2∆Γ)1/2fkL2(Γ), where I denotes the identity. For σ ≥ 0, set

2 (cid:19)2! λ−2 − 1 with Re ρ0 > 0.
Theorem 3.1. For every 0 < δ ≪ 1, independent of λ, there are positive constants Cδ, eCδ and
δ1 = δ1(δ) such that for Re λ ≥ eCδ, Cδ ≤ |Im λ| ≤ δ1Re λ, we have the estimate

Let 0 < κ1 < κ2 < 1 be constants and let φ(r) ∈ C ∞

φ(|x|) vanishes near Γ. Denote by H 1

r (Ω) the space equipped with the norm

0 ([κ1, κ2]). Then the function χ(x) =

r (Ω) = kukL2(Ω) + |λ|−1k∂rukL2(Ω),

where r = |x| is the radial variable. It is easy to see that the estimate (2.2) implies the following

satisﬁes the estimate

Lemma 3.2. There exist positive constants C and eC such that the solution u of equation (3.1)

We will now study the DN map in a more general situation. Let c(x), n(x) ∈ C ∞(Ω) be

strictly positive functions and deﬁne the DN map associated to these functions by

where u is the solution to the equation

u = f

We suppose that there exist a constant 0 < δ0 ≪ 1 and positive constants ec and en such that
c(x) =ec, n(x) =en in Ω(δ0). Set

2 (cid:19)2! λ−2 −en/ec with Reeρ > 0.
Theorem 3.3. For every 0 < δ ≪ 1, independent of λ, there are positive constants Cδ, eCδ and
δ1 = δ1(δ) such that for Re λ ≥ eCδ, Cδ log |λ| ≤ |Im λ| ≤ δ1Re λ, we have the estimate
I(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2(Γ)→H 1(Γ) ≤ δ.
Proof. We will compare N (λ) with the DN map eN (λ) deﬁned by

Clearly, we have

ec(cid:19)1/2! .
kN (λ) − eN (λ)kL2(Γ)→L2(Γ) ≤ eC|λ|e−C|Im λ|.

In other words, the estimate (3.2) holds true with N0 and ρ0 replaced by eN and eρ, respectively.
Lemma 3.4. There exist positive constants C and eC such that we have the estimate
(3.10)
Proof. Denote by GD the Dirichlet self-adjoint realization of the operator −n−1∇c∇ on the
Hilbert space L2(Ω, n(x)dx). Let χ1 be a smooth function depending only on the radial variable
such that χ1 = 1 in Ω(δ0/3), χ1 = 0 in Ω \ Ω(δ0/2). Let u1 be the solution to (3.7) and u2 the
solution to (3.9), u1 = u2 = f on Γ. We have

and u1 − χ1u2 = 0 on Γ. Hence

(cid:0)n−1∇c∇ + λ2(cid:1) χ1u2 =(cid:0)en−1ec∆ + λ2(cid:1) χ1u2 =en−1ec[∆, χ1]u2

which implies

u1 − χ1u2 = −(GD − λ2)−1en−1ec[∆, χ1]u2

(3.11)
where γ denotes the restriction on Γ. Let χ2 be a smooth function depending only on the radial
variable such that χ2 = 1 on supp[∆, χ1] and χ2 = 0 in Ω(δ0/4). By (3.11) we obtain

N (λ)f − eN (λ)f = −λ−1γ∂ν(GD − λ2)−1en−1ec[∆, χ1]u2,
kN (λ)f − eN (λ)fkL2(Γ) ≤ C(cid:13)(cid:13)γ∂ν (GD − λ2)−1(cid:13)(cid:13)L2(Ω)→L2(Γ) kχ2u2kH 1

where the Sobolev space H 3/2(Ω) is equipped with the usual norm. Now (3.10) follows from
(3.6), (3.12) and (3.13).

On the other hand, by the trace theorem and the coercitivity of GD we have

Clearly, to prove Theorem 1.1 one has to show that, under the conditions (4.1) or (4.2), T (λ)f =
0 implies f = 0 for λ ∈ Λℓ, ℓ = 1, 2, where

Λ1 = {λ ∈ C : Re λ ≫ 1, 1 ≪ |Im λ| ≪ Re λ}

when the functions cj, nj are constants in Ω,

Λ2 = {λ ∈ C : Re λ ≫ 1, log(Re λ) ≪ |Im λ| ≪ Re λ}

when the functions cj, nj are constants in Ω(δ0), only. Denote by eρj, j = 1, 2, the functions
obtained by replacing the pair (c, n) by (cj, nj) in the deﬁnition of the function eρ introduced in

Section 3. If T (λ)f = 0, λ ∈ Λℓ, ℓ = 1, 2, by Theorems 3.1 and 3.3, respectively, we have for all
δ > 0,

if (4.1) holds, and

if (4.2) holds. On the other hand, one gets

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(1 − |λ|−2∆Γ)1/2 (eρ1(−∆Γ) −eρ2(−∆Γ)) f(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2(Γ) ≤ δkfkL2(Γ)

Hence, under the above conditions, g(σ) 6= 0, ∀σ ≥ 0, and we have the bound

where k = 1 if (4.1) holds and k = −1 if (4.2) holds. This implies that the operator

is bounded on L2(Γ) uniformly in λ. Therefore, in both cases by (4.3) and (4.4) we conclude

kfkL2(Γ) ≤ CδkfkL2(Γ),

∀δ > 0, λ ∈ Λℓ,

with a constant C > 0 independent of δ. Hence, taking δ small enough we deduce from (4.6)
that kfk = 0, which is the desired result.
