Abstract: Motivated by the recent results in arXiv:1601.05679 about the quark-antiquark
potential in N = 4 SYM, we reconsider the problem of computing the asymptotic weak-
coupling expansion of the ground state energy of a certain class of 1d Schrödinger operators
− d2
dx2 + λ V (x) with long-range potential V (x). In particular, we consider even potentials
R dx V (x) < 0 with large x asymptotics V ∼ −a/x2 − b/x3 + ··· . The associated
Schrödinger operator is known to admit a bound state for λ → 0+, but the binding energy
is rigorously non-analytic at λ = 0. Its asymptotic expansion starts at order O(λ), but
contains higher corrections λn logm λ with all 0 ≤ m ≤ n − 1 and standard Rayleigh-
Schrödinger perturbation theory fails order by order in λ. We discuss various analytical
tools to tame this problem and provide the general expansion of the binding energy at
O(λ3) in terms of quadratures. The method is tested on a soluble potential that is fully
under control, and on various non-soluble cases as well. A supersymmetric case, arising in
the study of the quark-antiquark potential in N = 6 ABJ(M) theory, is also exploited to
provide a further non-trivial consistency check. Our analytical results conﬁrm at third order
a remarkable exponentiation of the leading infrared logarithms, ﬁrst noticed in N = 4 SYM
where it may be proved by Renormalization Group arguments. We prove this interesting
feature at all orders at the level of the Schrödinger equation for general potentials in the
considered class.

Introduction

Let us consider the Schrödinger operator in one dimension

H = − d2

dx2 + λ V (x),

x ∈ R, λ > 0.

(1.1)

– 1 –

A variational argument shows that if V (x) ≤ 0, with V (x) < 0 on an open set, and V (x) → 0
at inﬁnity, then H has a bound state for all λ > 0. The lowest eigenvalue E0(λ) is real
analytic for λ > 0 under mild conditions on V [1]. Interesting questions are analyticity at
λ = 0 and the existence of bound states for small λ when V is somewhere positive. 1 The
R dx (1 + x2)|V (x)| < ∞, there is a
unique bound state for small λ. The ground state (binding) energy may be estimated in
this case by the formula

R dx (1 + x2)|V (x)| = ∞, and V (x) ∼ −a|x|−β at
inﬁnity, the results of [11] imply the following. For 2 < β < 3, the estimate (1.2) is still
R dx V (x) ≤ 0.
However, (1.2) is violated because the r.h.s. develops a term λ2 log λ. If 1 < β < 2, there
are inﬁnitely many bound states for any λ > 0 and (1.2) is valid when restricted to the ﬁrst
term only, i.e.

Here, we shall be concerned with the β = 2 case. Further discussion of other long-range
cases may be found in [12, 13] and in the review [14]. Thus, in this paper, we shall address
the problem (1.1) with a potential in the class deﬁned by the conditions

V (x) x→∞∼ −a x−2 − b|x|−3 + ··· ,

(1.4)
and, for simplicity, we shall also assume it to be even V (x) = V (−x). The modiﬁed form
of (1.2) under the conditions in (1.4) has been found in [11] and reads

(1.5)

A non-analytic logarithmic factor enhances the second order term. Standard Rayleigh-
Schrödinger perturbation theory completely fails and this term is inﬁnite. 3 In general,
it is very diﬃcult to recover results like (1.5) from some kind of regularized perturbation
theory. A very illustrative example are crude infrared cutoﬀs like |x| ≤ L. 4 Finite size
1The large λ limit is completely diﬀerent, see for instance [2, 3], although in some cases, scale invariance

connects it to the weak coupling regime [4].

2This short-range case is much simpler [6] and may be treated by standard perturbation theory. For
instance, a quite compact extension of (1.2) to order O(λ4) is discussed in [7–9] and may be easily extended
at higher orders. The ﬁrst term of (1.2) may be found immediately by applying the Feynman-Hellman
theorem [10].

3 It is important to emphasize that we are not dealing with the divergence of the perturbative series due
to a vanishing radius of convergence. The long-distance behaviour of the potential is such that the single
terms in the Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbative expansion are separately divergent.

4 The study of the infrared problems that appear when V (x) is treated as a perturbation of the laplacian
dates back to the initial developments of quantum mechanics. A celebrated example is E. P. Wigner’s
discussion of the hydrogen atom in the classical paper [15], see also [16].

eﬀects may be suppressed at large L but by factors like e−λ g or similar. Expanding ﬁrst in
λ shows that the cutoﬀ dependence is increasingly bad at higher orders.

we can obtain the quark-antiquark potential − 1

A modern application of results like (1.5) is to the study of the quark-antiquark static
potential in ﬂat space for N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU (Nc). 5
The static potential is extracted from a pair of anti-parallel Wilson lines separated by the
6,

distance r [18, 19]. In the planar limit Nc → ∞, with ﬁxed ’t Hooft coupling(cid:98)λ = g2
r Ω((cid:98)λ) from the expectation value of the
associated Wilson loop. The function Ω((cid:98)λ) is known at 3 loops at weak coupling [18, 20–
quark and antiquark. The generalized potential Ω((cid:98)λ, ϑ) has been recently studied in [30] by
results of [30] is the analytic weak coupling expansion of Ω((cid:98)λ, ϑ) up to 7 loops, i.e. at order
(cid:98)λ e−i ϑ. This limit resums the ladder diagrams in the gauge theory and the quark-antiquark

25] and at one loop at strong coupling [26–29]. This construction can be extended by
introducing an angular parameter ϑ that takes into account the relative ﬂavours of the

O(λ7). A particularly interesting limit is the double scaling regime ϑ → i∞ with ﬁxed

means of the Quantum Spectral Curve methods developed in [31]. One of the remarkable

YM Nc

potential is obtained as the ground state energy of a 1d Schrödinger equation with potential
in the class (1.4). In the notation of (1.1), the problem addressed in [30] corresponds to the
speciﬁc potential

whose leading part is a simple exponentiation. The expansion (1.7) and the resummation
(1.8) pose several interesting questions. The ﬁrst is whether the structure of (1.7) is general,

5Another (older) interesting physical application of (1.1) with potential in the class (1.4) occurs in the
study of wetting transition of 2d surfaces [17]. In that context, the interface free-energy density is given in
the thermodynamic limit by the lowest eigenvalue E0 of (1.1) where x denotes the perpendicular distance
of the interface from the substrate, and V (x) is the potential well that localizes the interface below the
transition temperature, related to λ.

6 We introduce a slightly unconventional hat in the notation for the ’t Hooft coupling to avoid confusion
with the coupling λ in (1.1) that we prefer to keep in order to match the conventions in the mathematical
physics literature.

i.e. if it is true that – at least at third order – for all potentials in the class (1.4) one has

(cid:112)−E0(λ) = c1,0 λ + (c2,1 log λ + c2,0) λ2 + (c3,2 log2 λ + c3,1 log λ + c3,0) λ3 + ··· . (1.9)

The second question concerns the general validity of resummation formulas like (1.8). In the
context of the static quark-antiquark potential, resummation of leading and next-to-leading
logarithms has been performed by a Renormalization Group (RG) analysis in [20, 23]. In
particular, leading logarithms simply exponentiate and, since they are computed exactly
by the ladder approximation, this explain the ﬁrst term in (1.8). Nevertheless, it would be
interesting to understand whether such exponentiation is expected for a general potential
and can be determined at the level of the Schrödinger equation. This question is particularly
intriguing because in gauge theories the RG exponentiation – at leading order – encodes
the factorization scale dependence that remains after cancellation between real and virtual
infrared divergences. In the Schrödinger equation, this deep machinery is somewhat absent
and exponentiation of logarithms of λ is less clear and more elusive.
The plan and content of this paper is the following. In Sec. (2), we discuss a fully solvable
potential in the class (1.4) where we provide the expansion of the binding energy at high
order showing that it admits the structure in (1.9) as well as an exponentiation formula
similar to (1.8).
In Sec. (3), we present a ﬁrst simple extension of the result (1.5), by
computing the subleading coeﬃcient c2,0 in (1.9). The derivation is rather straightforward,
but cannot be easily extended at higher orders. To overcome these diﬃculties, we apply
in Sec. (4) the general approach of matched asymptotic expansions to our problem. As a
preparation, Sec. (4.1) is devoted to discuss a toy-model that captures the essence of the
method. Then, in Sec. (4.2), we apply it to the determination of (1.9) and we compute
the complete third order expansion for a general potential. Our main result, summarized
in (4.39) and (4.40), is tested on various solvable and non-solvable examples in Sec. (5).
In particular, Sec. (5.5) presents several high precision numerical tests of the third order
expansions to appreciate its accuracy at small coupling, despite being only asymptotic. As
a ﬁnal test, we discuss in Sec. (6) a consistency check of our expansion, when applied to a
supersymmetric potential arising in the study of the quark-antiquark potential in N = 6
ABJ(M) theory. Finally, our third order expansion suggests exponentiation of the leading
logarithms in the form (see the ﬁrst term of (1.8) as a special case)

In Sec. (7), we prove that this result holds at all orders. Finally, Sec. (8) summarises our
conclusions and outlines possible further directions.

2 A solvable example

The potential (1.6) may be treated by the Quantum Spectral Curve as a special limit. To
improve our knowledge, we also analyze the following solvable case discussed in [11, 32]

in the other terms are not surprising because here the O(x−3) subleading term at inﬁnity
is non zero, and may be important. Collecting data from (1.7) and (2.3), we obtain the

This is what we want to be able to compute for a general potential in the class (1.4).
Of course, the (leading) second order rigorous result (1.5) is fully consistent with the entries
in Tab. (1).

3 The complete second order expansion

A ﬁrst simple extension of the result (1.5) obtained in [11] concerns the determination of
the coeﬃcient c2,0 in (1.9). The analysis in [11] is based on the results of [5] that imply

– 5 –

that the ground state energy E0 = −α2 is obtained from the condition

where Kα is the Birman-Schwinger operator [1]

det(1 + λ Kα) = 0,

Kα(x, y) =

We can expand (3.1) as follows

|V (x)|1/2 e−α |x−y| |V (y)|1/2 sign(V (y)).

The rigorous analysis of [11] leads to the result (1.5) for the λ and λ2 log λ term. If we want
to capture the λ2 term (without logarithmic enhancement), we need to study in details the

For a speciﬁc potential, one can study this integral for α → 0 8, but here we want to discuss
(3.7) in general terms. One straightforward approach is the following. Since V (x) is real,

(cid:101)V (ω)∗ = (cid:101)V (−ω) and U (ω) ≡ |(cid:101)V (ω)|2 is even. The expression (3.7) can be split as follows

For an even potential (cid:101)V (ω) is also even, and then U(cid:48)(0+) = 2(cid:101)V (0)(cid:101)V (cid:48)(0+). Then,

3.3 Leading logarithms at third order
One may attempt to apply this approach to work out the third order contribution to

√−E0, but this is deﬁnitely a non-trivial task, although the leading order term ∼ λ3 log2 λ

is heuristically derived in App. (B). In the next section, we shall introduce an alternative
method that is powerful enough to fully compute the third order expansion and, in principle,
also higher order terms.

4 Matched Asymptotic Expansion, the complete third order

A completely diﬀerent approach is based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions
for boundary layer problems [33, 34]. Although the idea is the same as in the standard
examples of singular perturbation of diﬀerential equations [35], the speciﬁc application to
10 Earlier studies in the
the present setup is rather diﬀerent and somewhat unusual.
context of the quark-antiquark potential may be found in [37, 38]. For the potential VI(x),
this method has been successfully exploited in [21]. The method is fully general and we
shall present its application for a generic potential in the class (1.4). A recent application
to a diﬀerent kind of Schrödinger problem may be found in [39]. 11 We now ﬁrst present a
simple example illustrating the procedure and then apply the method to our case.

4.1 A toy model
Let us consider the ﬁrst order boundary problem

(cid:18)

ψ(cid:48)(x) =

α +

ψ(0) = 1,

(cid:19)

λ

ψ(x),
1 + x
ψ(λ−1) = 1.

Although apparently contrived, this problem captures the essential features of our problem.
We are interested in the λ → 0+ limit and there are two boundary conditions, one in the
UV region, at small x, and one in the IR region, at large x. The two boundary conditions
determine α as a function of λ. Indeed, the exact solution of (4.1) before imposing the
boundary condition at x = λ−1 is

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

Imposing ψ(λ−1) = 1, we obtain the following asymptotic expansion 12

ψ(x) = eα x (1 + x)λ.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

10 The application of matched asymptotic expansion methods to the Schrödinger equation in the semi-
classical limit is of course a text-book topic, see for instance [36] for a clean pedagogical presentation. In
that context, matching is applied around the inversion points.

11 The main new complication to be discussed here is the presence of non-analytic terms in a boundary
problem eigenvalue. This is a feature that, for instance, is absent in the analysis of the Mathieu equation
in [35].

12 We remark that in this simple example, the non-analyticity due to logarithms is limited to the ﬁrst

term, while the remainder is actually a power series with unit convergence radius.

– 9 –

that is the result we want to derive by an alternative route. To this aim, we apply the ideas
of matched asymptotic expansions and look for two approximate solutions of (4.1). The
ﬁrst is ψIR(x) and is valid around x = ∞, with ψIR(λ−1) = 1. The second is ψUV(x) and
must be used around x = 0, with ψUV(0) = 1. The two solutions must be compared by
imposing the symbolic matching

x→∞ ψUV(x) = lim
lim
x→0

ψIR(x).

(4.4)

For this procedure to make sense, the precise meaning of the relation (4.4) is that we need
ψUV(x) (cid:39) ψIR(x) in an intermediate overlap region, as shown in Fig. (1). Besides, in our
application the matching will be imposed perturbatively in λ.

Figure 1. Qualitative picture illustrating the Matched Asymptotic Expansion procedure.

Following this approach, the ﬁrst step is to consider the approximate equation that is

obtained at large x and solve it with the IR boundary condition:

IR(x) =

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(cid:19)

We have kept four terms in the large x expansion of the potential. This is instructive
with the aim of keeping track of the role of the various corrections. In other words, the
coeﬃcients ξ3, ξ4 are useful to identify terms that depend on including (ξ = 1) or excluding
(ξ = 0) a certain subleading part of V . The solution of (4.5) is

Now, we make the educated guess 13

α = A λ2 log λ + B λ3 + ··· ,

(cid:21)

(4.6)

(4.7)

and expand (4.6) at small λ, and ﬁxed x. This is an expansion in powers of λ with possible
powers of log λ. Explicitly, we ﬁnd

ψIR(x) = 1 + λ ψIR,1(x) + λ2 ψIR,2(x) + ··· ,

(4.8)

13 The appearance of a double expansion in λ and log λ is familiar in the context of matched asymptotic

techniques where logarithmic terms are commonly named as switchback corrections [40].

In the UV region, we consider the unmodiﬁed initial problem, but impose only the boundary
condition at x = 0

ψUV(x),

(4.10)

ψUV(0) = 1.

To match (4.8), we solve (4.10) pertubatively in λ, taking into account (4.7),

ψUV(x) = 1 + λ ψUV,1(x) + λ2 ψUV,2(x) + ··· ,

ψUV,n(0) = 0.

(4.11)

This gives immediately

ψUV,1(x) = log(x + 1),

ψUV,2(x) = A x log λ +

1
2

log2(x + 1).

(4.12)

Finally, we attempt to match the two solutions (4.8) and (4.11) by evaluating the ratio

R(x, λ) =

ψIR(x)
ψUV(x)

= 1 + λ R1(x, λ) + λ2 R2(x, λ) + ··· .

(4.13)

The contribution from the UV region must be expanded at large x where the overlap region
is located. Doing so, we obtain at ﬁrst order

R1(x, λ) = (1 − A) log λ +

1 − ξ3
2 x2 +

ξ4 − 1
3x3 +

4x4 − 1

5x5 + ··· .

(4.14)

Thus, we see that matching (Rn = 0) requires A = 1 in agreement with (4.3). This does
not depend on the ξ-terms, i.e. the x−3 and x−4 corrections to V included in (4.5). The
correct choice ξ3 = ξ4 = 1 cancels the various corrections in (4.14), but we repeat that this
is irrelevant to ﬁx A. With the choice A = 1, we can inspect R2(x, λ) and ﬁnd
R2(x, λ) = −B−1+

(4.15)
Again, the coeﬃcient B is ﬁxed at B = −1 in agreement with (4.3). The ﬁrst two subleading
corrections in (4.15) vanish if we include the x−3 correction in (4.5). Doing so, i.e. taking
ξ3 = 1, we get

(4.16)

– 11 –

showing that the inclusion of the x−4 correction in (4.5), i.e. taking ξ4 = 1, cancel two
additional subleading terms.

4.2 Application to the third order correction

We now apply to our main problem the procedure that worked for the toy model (4.1).

is convenient to set α = A(λ) λ and we ﬁnd (cn are constant terms dependent of A, a, b, λ,
but independent of x)

4.2.2 Analysis of the ultraviolet region
In the UV region, we ﬁrst expand the exact equation

− ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) + (α2 + λ V (x)) ψ(x) = 0,

in powers of λ

This leads to

ψ(x) = 1 + λ ψ1(x) + λ2 ψ2(x) + λ3 ψ3(x) + . . . .

ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)
1 (x) = V (x),
ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)
2 (x) = A2 + V (x) ψ1(x),
ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)
3 (x) = A2 ψ1(x) + V (x) ψ2(x),

and so on.

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

Now, we want to solve these equations with the condition ψ(cid:48)
n(0) = 0. The values ψn(0)
are not relevant because they may be absorbed by a redeﬁnition of ψ(x) by a factor that
depends on λ but not on x. We shall choose ψn(0) = 0. Thus, (4.25) has to be solved with

ψn(0) = ψ(cid:48)

n(0) = 0.

(4.26)

Given the solution, we want to expand it at large x and compare with (4.22), after the
educated guess, including switchback logarithmic terms,

A(λ) = c1,0 + (c2,1 log λ + c2,0) λ + (c3,2 log2 λ + c3,1 log λ + c3,0) λ3 + . . . .

(4.27)

To see how this works, let us begin with ψ1(x), i.e. 14

(cid:90) x

ψ1(x) =

dx(cid:48) (x − x(cid:48)) V (x(cid:48)).

Comparing the UV expansion (4.30) with the IR expansion (4.22), we see that we indeed

We present a numerical test of the accuracy of the asymptotic expansions (5.3), (5.6), and
the new (5.10,5.11). The convergence radius of these expansions is expected to be zero, but
looking at suﬃciently small λ, it is possible to appreciate the improvement associated with
the higher order terms. The following tables will present the ﬁrst, second, and third order

expansion of(cid:112)−E0(λ) for the four considered potentials. The last column, labeled exact

is obtained by ﬁnding the ground state in the interval x ∈ [0, L]. 16 For suﬃciently large

6 A further consistency check from N = 6 ABJ(M) theory

Apart from general questions, our initial motivation came from the Quantum Spectral
Curve results on the static quark-antiquark potential in N = 4 super Yang-Mills gauge
theory. Quite recently, new interesting results appeared in the study of the cusp anomalous
dimension in N = 6 ABJ(M) theory. A scaling limit has been identiﬁed where ladder
diagrams dominate and the Bethe-Salpeter equation leads again to a Schrödinger problem
[41]. This problem is studied for generic Wilson loop Euclidean cusp angle ϕ. The anti-
parallel limit ϕ → π is the one relevant for the calculation of the static potential, but
requires some care as it is singular as in N = 4 SYM. On general grounds, it is expected
that the larger amount of supersymmetry should be responsible for cancellation of the non-
analytic logarithms [42]. Technically, in the ladder approximation, this feature is due to
the fact that the Schrödinger potential in the ladder approximation is supersymmetric, i.e.
it has the the structure of Witten’s supersymmetric quantum mechanics [43]. In particular,
the N = 6 ABJ(M) version of the potential (1.6) – relevant for N = 4 SYM – reads 17

The exact bound state wave function is ψ(x) = N exp(−λ

E0 = −λ2, without (logarithmic) corrections. We can put this problem in the form (1.1),
by considering the potential

where µ has to be replaced by λ at the end of the calculation. This is a well-deﬁned
procedure and the replacement µ → λ simply induces a rearrangement of the asymptotic
expansion. Applying (4.39) to (6.2), we obtain the non-trivial expansion at generic ﬁxed µ

of our expansion (4.39).

7 Universal resummation of leading infrared logarithms

The resummation results in (1.8) and (2.4) are consistent with (4.39), (4.40). It is tempt-
ing to conjecture that leading logarithms indeed exponentiate at all orders, i.e. that the
expression

= − V
2

λ e2 a λ log λ,

(7.1)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)LO
(cid:112)−E0(λ)

captures all terms of the form λn+1 logn λ. Exponentiation results like (7.1) appears in
applications of matched asymptotic expansions often together with Renormalization Group
techniques [44–47]. However, a general treatment is missing and we devote this section
to the analysis of (7.1) in our speciﬁc setup. A physical argument for (7.1) is that the
non-analytic logarithms of the coupling are an infrared eﬀect related to the long-distance
behaviour of the potential. This somewhat explains why resummation involves essentially
the coeﬃcient a in (1.4). Nevertheless, it is amusing that some global information about the
potential is needed in the form of the prefactor in (7.1) that depends on V . An interesting
further check of (7.1) may be presented by considering a soluble cut-oﬀ version of the
potential VII(x), as discussed in App. (C).

A general proof of (7.1) may be given exploiting the clever splitting of the Birman-
Schwinger operator (3.2) introduced in [12]. To this aim, we deﬁne the operators Pα, Qα
with integral kernels

Pα(x, y) = − 1
2
Qα(x, y) = − 1

|V (x)|1/2 e−α |x| e−α |y| |V (y)|1/2 sign(V (x)),
|V (x)|1/2

e−α |x−y| − e−α |x| e−α |y|(cid:21)
(cid:20)

|V (y)|1/2 sign(V (x)).

(7.2)

According to the Birman-Schwinger principle [1], the Schrödinger operator in (1.1) has
the eigenvalue −α2 if and only if Pα + Qα has eigenvalue α/λ or, equivalently, if 1 −
λ α−1 (Pα + Qα) is not invertible – compare with (3.1). Since Pα is rank 1, this translates
into the condition

8 Conclusions

In summary, we have reconsidered the one-dimensional Schrödinger problem (1.1) for long-
range potentials in the class (1.4) with the aim of deriving an improved asymptotic expan-
sion of the binding energy of the (unique) bound state that is present at weak coupling.

18 Alternatively, one may replace at this point V by its leading asymptotic and reduce to the problem in

Sec. (2) where computations may be done more explicitly.

– 22 –

Non-analytic terms are present at all orders in the coupling and are of course of infrared
origin. Our setup is the simplest possible where such infrared problems occur and it is
not possible to apply the powerful machinery of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. In par-
ticular, there are no simple cut-oﬀ procedures that capture them accurately ﬁxing the
correct long-distance scales. We computed the general third order asymptotic expansion
by methods coming from boundary layer theory. In principle, similar techniques may be
applied to more diﬃcult problems involving diﬀerent behaviours at inﬁnity, like for instance
V (x) ∼ log(x)/x2 or even log(x)/x3, where the extension is non trivial. It would be quite
interesting to explore similar problems in more than one dimension.

For λ → 0, we have ν → 1/2 and α = O(λ). Thus, (A.2) may be consistently solved
iteratively α = α(0) + α(1) + ··· , i.e.

We can expand these expressions for λ → 0 and introduce the quantity L = log λ + γE −

is essentially F (α) in (3.5). For this quantity we know that its small α → 0+ expansion
has leading term α (# log α + #). 19 There are further correction O(α2), but an analysis
of (3.5) shows that they do not contain log2 α enhancement factors. This means that the
λ3 log2 λ term comes entirely from the very last term of (3.3), i.e.

−

To support the universal exponentiation of the leading logarithms as well as to show how
it cannot be trivially extended to next-to-leading logarithms, we consider the illustrative
problem associated with the following potential

V (x) =

4 (1+|x|)2

if |x| ≤ x0,
if |x| > x0.

x0 > 0,

(C.1)

This is a simple modiﬁcation of VII(x) that replaces it by the constant VII(x0) for |x| ≤ x0.
Thus, the asymptotic behaviour at inﬁnity is unchanged. The study of this example is
useful to see how the global shape of V aﬀects the asymptotic expansion of its ground state
energy. The exact ground state wave function is (with irrelevant arbitrary normalization)

(C.4)
Of course, the expansion (C.4) reduces to (2.3) for x0 = 0 and is consistent with (4.39)
and (4.40) for generic x0 – the prefactor in (C.4) is − 1
2 V . The leading logarithms are
precisely the same as in (2.3). We pushed further the expansion (C.4) identifying the
rational coeﬃcients of the higher leading logarithms and they continue to agree with (2.3).
This strongly supports the exponentiation (7.1), where the prefactor depends on the global
shape of V , while the exponential is universal in the sense that it depends only on the
coeﬃcient of the leading term of V at inﬁnity. Instead, the subleading logarithms depend on
x0 both through the scale entering the deﬁnition of L as well as in the remaining coeﬃcient
of the λn+2 Ln contributions.
