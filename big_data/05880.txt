Abstract

We study the typical collisional velocities in a polydisperse suspension of droplets in two and

three-dimensional turbulent ﬂow and obtain precise theoretical estimates of the dependence of the

impact velocity of particles-pairs on their relative sizes. These analytical results are validated

against data from our direct numerical simulations. We show that the impact velocity saturates

exponentially with the inverse of the particle-size ratios. Our results are important to model

coalescence or fragmentation (depending on the impact velocities) and will be crucial, for example,

in obtaining precise coalescence kernels to describe the growth of water droplets which trigger rain

in warm clouds.

A wide variety of industrial, experimental and natural phenomena – such as volcanic

eruptions, embryonic planetesimals in circumstellar disks and growth of water droplets trig-

gering rain in warm clouds – involves coalescence, collisions, and fragmentation of small,

heavy particles carried by a turbulent ﬂow [1]. Given the ubiquitousness and generality of

particle-laden ﬂows, problems of this class have been the subject of intense research in the

last few years. As a result signiﬁcant progress has been made in our understanding of not

only the appropriate theoretical [2], numerical [3] and mathematical framework [4] to study

such systems but also the nature of coalescence and collisions in both idealised [5] and real-

istic settings [6]. In the last couple of years, for example, several authors have elucidated,

theoretically and in experiments, questions related to the distribution of relative velocities

of approaching particles [7, 8] and the extreme events associated with them. Such studies

are a key building block in helping us to eventually model eﬀective collision kernels which

would be crucial in computing, for example, droplet distributions in warm clouds.

Much of the work related to the issue of approach rates and relative velocities of particle-

pairs deal with systems of identical particles [9–11]. However in nature, the distribution

of particles is typically inhomogeneous. Hence particles of diﬀerent sizes interact with one

another. Furthermore, to critically understand if coalescences dominate – leading to the

growth of larger and larger droplets – an estimate of the strength of impact velocities of

particles with diﬀerent radii is crucial. In particular the role of preferential concentration

(which changes with particle radii) of particles at small scales as well as possible large

velocity diﬀerences due to caustics [12] and the sling eﬀect [13] ought to result in non-trivial

collisional velocities in an inhomogeneous size distribution of particles in a turbulent ﬂow.

Given all of this, it behooves us to ask the rate at which droplets or aggregates grow

in an inhomogeneous size distribution of particles which are carried by the same turbulent

ﬂow. This, it is worth stressing, is the natural setting for processes which are of relevance

in nature and in the most general of laboratory settings. A ﬁrst step in this direction

is to understand how violent the impact velocities amongst diﬀerent particles are in such

polydisperse suspensions. A quantitative measure of this, in turn, will suggest whether the

impact between particle-pairs of radii a1 and a2 will result in a coalescence – leading to a

larger droplet – or fragmentation [14]. Thus, in this paper we address (in two and three

dimensions), numerically and theoretically, the critical question of the dependence of the

impact velocities of particle-pairs on the relative sizes of the particles.

the Kolmogorov time scale.

We consider a ﬂuid ﬂow whose velocity u is a solution to the incompressible Navier–Stokes

equation

∂tu + (u · ∇)u = −∇p + ν∇2u + f , ∇ · u = 0,

(1)

where ν designates the ﬂuid kinematic viscosity. In two dimensions (2D), it is often conve-

nient to re-write this in the vorticity (ω)-stream function (ψ) formulation [15] as

∂tω − J(ψ, ω) = ν∇2ω + fω − µω,

(2)

where J(ψ, ω) ≡ (∂xψ)(∂yω)− (∂xω)(∂yψ) and µ is the coeﬃcient of Ekman friction. At the
point (x,y) the velocity u ≡ (−∂yψ, ∂xψ) and the vorticity ω = ∇ψ.

We now study the dynamics of small inertial particles (droplets) which are suspended in a

turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld obtained as a solution of Eq. (1) in three dimensions (3D) or of Eq. (2) in

2D in the limit of small ν or large Reynolds numbers. We assume that our particles are much

smaller than the Kolmogorov scale η, much heavier than the surrounding ﬂuid, and with a

small Reynolds number associated to their slip velocity. The motion of the i-th particle, in

the turbulent ﬂuid, is damped through a viscous Stokes drag and their trajectories xi(t) are

deﬁned via

The relaxation time τp = 2ρpa2/(9ρfν), where ρp and ρf are the particle and ﬂuid mass

density respectively and a the particle radius, allows us to deﬁne a non-dimensional Stokes

number St = τp/τη; the small time-scale τη is the Kolmogorov time scale and an intrinsic

property of the ﬂuid [16].

We perform direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of Eq. (3) coupled with Eq. (1) in 3D

or Eq. (2) in 2D. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved in a 2π periodic domain (with

the number of collocation points N 3 (3D) or N 2 (2D)) by using a standard pseudospectral

method and a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme for time-marching. We maintain statisti-

cally steady homogeneous, isotropic turbulence via the large-scale forcing f in 2D and by

a constant energy injection in 3D on wavenumbers kinj. The parameters of both sets of

simulations are given in Table I.

with a Stokes time τp; we choose 50 diﬀerent τp in 2D and 20 diﬀerent τp in 3D. We thus

integrate individual particle trajectories for diﬀerent values of τp and the ﬂuid velocity u at

their location is evaluated by linear interpolation. We study the dynamics of the particles

within the framework of ghost collisions and hence we do not perform any real collisions;

results of the eﬀect of collisions will be reported elsewhere [17]. Given the assumption on

the particle sizes, we work within the framework of one-way coupling between the particles

and the ﬂuid and ignore any eﬀect of the particles on the ﬂow.

The impact velocity between colliding droplets, which determines the chance of coales-

cence or fragmentation, is deﬁned as the velocity diﬀerence of the two particles at vanishing

separation. Thence, we deﬁne the impact velocity between two particles, labelled 1 and 2, of
Stokes numbers St1 and St2 as ∆ = (cid:104)|(v2−v1)·ˆr|(cid:105), where the unit vector ˆr deﬁnes the vector
connecting the centers of the two particles, with the constraint that (v2 − v1) · ˆr < 0 which
deﬁne a pair of approaching particles [18]. The averaging (cid:104)·(cid:105) is deﬁned over all colliding
pairs.

In Fig. 1 we show a pseudo-color plot of the amplitude of the impact velocity ∆ as

a function of the Stokes numbers of the colliding particles is shown from our data from

the 2D simulations, with similar results obtained in our 3D DNS. (In this plot and all

subsequent plots, we show ∆ normalised by the Kolmogorov velocity uη = η/τη of the

underlying turbulent ﬂuid.) Qualitatively, it is easy to understand the diagonal (St1 = St2)

behaviour of ∆: The two-particle velocity correlation between particles (when the size of one

particle is ﬁxed and the other varied) attains a maximum when particles are of the same size

(St1 = St2) [19]. Consequently, ∆ attains a minimum when the approaching particles have

the same Stokes number as is clearly seen in Fig. 1. For larger Stokes numbers, ∆ becomes

larger because of the formation of caustics which allow same-sized particles to collide with

5

each other with arbitrarily large velocities.

is our theoretical prediction and the symbols are data from our simulations in 2D and 3D (inset).

The error bars on our numerical data are comparable to the symbol size.

In order to gain a complete understanding of the dependence of ∆ on St1 and St2, it is

useful to return to Eq. (3). Let us consider two particles 1 and 2 with Stokes times τ1 = τ

and τ2 = ατ1 = ατ . We consider the non-dimensional form of Eq. (3) (by including factors

of τη) to obtain

hence |u1 − u2| ≡ σ · r ∼ 0, as |r| → 0 (σ is the gradient of the ﬂuid velocity).

So far we have made only one defensible assumption in deriving Eq. (4) which has to do

with the smoothness of the velocity ﬁeld at small scales. To this extent Eq. (4) is exact in

both 2D and 3D. Let us now explore the various asymptotics of this equation and obtain

theoretical estimates of ∆ for diﬀerent combinations of Stokes numbers which can then be

tested against data from our DNSs in 2D and 3D. The following limits naturally arise in this

case (see Table II for a compact version of these limits): Case 1: α = 1 with no assumption
on St; Case 2: Particle 1 is very small and close to being a tracer (St (cid:28) 1) and α ∼ O(1)
such that St2 (cid:46) 1; Case 3: Particle 1 is still small (St (cid:28) 1) but α (cid:29) 1 such that St2 (cid:29) 1;
and Case 4: For St (cid:38) 1. To obtain the limiting form of ∆ from Eq. (4) in each such case,
we assume that at time t = 0 the particles have come close to each other (without actually

colliding) with a velocity diﬀerence ∆0 and then, over a time τ , they touch.

For α = 1 (Case 1), integrating Eq. (4), we obtain ∆ = ∆0 exp (−τ /St), where (and in
what follows) ∆0 is the constant of integration. In Fig. 2 we test our theoretical prediction

(solid line) against data from our DNSs (symbols) in both 2D and 3D (inset) and ﬁnd

excellent agreement between the two.

We now address the important question of what happens when the two colliding particles
have diﬀerent Stokes numbers. Let us begin with Case 2 where St (cid:28) 1 (v1 ≈ u1) and
α ∼ O(1). In this limit, we can rewrite Eq. (4) as

Since αSt < 1, we can set αSt d∆
where St (cid:28) 1 and α (cid:29) 1 such that αSt > 1, we notice that St(1−α)
leading order since St (cid:28) 1. Thence we obtain ∆ = ∆0 exp (−τ /St2).

dt = 0 and obtain ∆ ∼ St2. In the other limit, Case 3,

Given the strong assumptions made in arriving at the two limits above, it is important

to check our prediction against data from our DNSs. In Fig. 3 we show a representative plot

of the impact velocity ∆ between particles of Stokes number St = 0.005 (2D) and tracers

(3D, inset) [20] with particles of diﬀerent Stokes numbers. We immediately notice that when
St2 (cid:46) 1, ∆ is indeed linear with St2 and the data (symbols) consistent with our theoretical
prediction shown as a blue curve. In the other limit when St2 (cid:29) 1, our data from numerical
simulations is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction ∆ ∼ exp (−1/St2).

FIG. 3. (color online) Representative plot of ∆, shown with symbols from our DNS data, as a
function of St2 for St = 0.005 (cid:28) 1 in 2D and for tracers in 3D (inset). Our theoretical prediction
for St2 < 1 and for St2 (cid:38) 1 are shown by the blue and black solid curves, respectively. The error

bars on our numerical data are comparable to the symbol size.

At this stage it is important to remark about the constant of integration. ∆0 is the

typically velocity diﬀerence with which two droplets come near each other. From very general

conditions, it is likely that ∆0 should depend on turbulent intensity, the spatial dimension,
as well as the relative Stokes numbers of the ﬂuid (when St1, St2 ∼ O(1). However we do not
have an analytical expression for ∆0 and as our theoretical and numerical results suggest,

∆0 is likely to be a constant or an algebraic, sub-dominant prefactor atleast in the range of

Stokes numbers studied here [21].

Let us ﬁnally turn to the situation when St (cid:38) 1 (Case 4). In Fig. 4 we show a repre-
sentative plot of the impact velocity between a particle of Stokes number St = 12.5 (2D)

and St = 20 (3D, inset) with all other particles. From our numerical data we see that

understanding of the functional form of the decrease in ∆ from Eq. (4).

Before concluding, we return to theoretical considerations which are central to this study.

In recent years much work has gone into understanding how large particle aggregates are

formed – mainly through coalescence – from small nuclei particles carried in a turbulent ﬂow.

This question is of fundamental importance when tackling issues as diverse as formation of

large rain droplets in warm clouds, pollutant dispersion and concentration, and the growth of

planetesimals in astrophysics. A stumbling block in a fully self-consistent theory to explain

such accelerated growths is the lack of realistic collision-coalescence kernels for diﬀerent-

sized particles which incorporate both fragmentation and coalescence. A ﬁrst step in this

direction is, of course, determining the dependence of impact velocities of colliding particles

on their sizes. In this paper we show, through theory and simulations, what this dependence

is.

Our results, summarised in Table II, are remarkable in their implication. We show that

the larger particles (large Stokes numbers) do not collide with arbitrarily large velocities with
the smaller, tracer-like particles but actually saturate (∼ exp (−1/St)). This suggests that
in inhomogeneous suspensions, such as the polydisperse droplet distribution in warm clouds,

a run-away growth for large droplets through coalescence (and not fragmenting because of

large velocity diﬀerences) is likely to be the dominant mechanism triggering rain [6, 22].

In conclusion, we have developed a systematic theory, validated through detailed numer-

ical simulations, for the impact velocity of colliding droplets of diﬀerent sizes. Remarkably,

our results seem to be independent of dimension. In particular we have shown that there is

a limiting form for the impact velocity and hence in natural settings coalescence – and not

fragmentation due to large ∆ – should be the dominant mechanism. Therefore this work is

a signiﬁcant step in developing models for coalescing droplets. Important questions related

to Reynolds and Froude number eﬀects is beyond the scope of the present work and the

issue of collision frequencies in polydisperse suspensions is addressed elsewhere [17].
