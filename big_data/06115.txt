CHOW’S THEOREM FOR LINEAR CODES

MARIUSZ KWIATKOWSKI, MARK PANKOV

Abstract. Let Γk(V ) be the Grassmann graph formed by k-dimensional sub-
spaces of an n-dimensional vector space over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq consisting of q
elements and 1 < k < n − 1. Denote by Γ(n, k)q the restriction of the Grass-
mann graph to the set of all non-degenerate linear [n, k]q codes. We describe
maximal cliques of the graph Γ(n, k)q and show that every automorphism of
this graph is induced by a monomial semilinear automorphism of V .

1. Introduction

Let us consider the Grassmann graph Γk(V ) formed by k-dimensional subspaces
of an n-dimensional vector space V over a ﬁeld (not necessarily ﬁnite). The classical
Chow theorem [3] (see also [2, 4, 6, 7, 9]) states that every automorphism of this
graph is induced by a semilinear automorphism of V if 1 < k < n − 1 an n 6= 2k.
In the case when n = 2k ≥ 4, there are also the automorphisms of Γk(V ) related
to semilinear isomorphisms of V to the dual vector space V ∗. For k = 1, n − 1
any two distinct vertices of the Grassmann graph are adjacent and every bijective
transformation of the vertex set is a graph automorphism.

Results of the same nature were obtained in the discipline known as Geometry
of Matrices [9]. Also, there are analogues of Chow’s theorem for Grassmannians
corresponding to Tits buildings of classical types [4, 6]. A generalization concerning
isometric embeddings of Grassmann graphs can be found in [7].

Now, we suppose that V is a vector space over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq consisting of
q elements and consider the restriction of the Grassmann graph to the set of all
non-degenerate linear [n, k]q codes (by [8], it is natural to reduce the study of linear
codes to the non-degenerate case only). Following [5] we denote this restriction by
Γ(n, k)q. Note that two distinct non-degenerate linear [n, k]q codes are adjacent
vertices of this graph if they have the maximal number of the same codewords.

In [5] the path distance on the graph Γ(n, k)q is investigated. In the present
paper, we show that every automorphism of Γ(n, k)q, 1 < k < n − 1 is induced
by a monomial semilinear automorphism of V . Recall that two linear codes are
semilinearly equivalent if there is a monomial semilinear automorphism transferring
one of them to the other. So, our result says that two non-degenerate linear [n, k]q
codes are semilinearly equivalent if and only if they are equivalent vertices of the
graph Γ(n, k)q, i.e. there is an automorphism of this graph transferring one of these
vertices to the other.

The proof of Chow’s theorem is based on the description of maximal cliques in
the Grassmann graph. There are precisely two types of maximal cliques — so-called
stars and tops. A star consists of all k-dimensional subspaces containing a ﬁxed

(k − 1)-dimensional subspace and a top is formed by all k-dimensional subspaces
contained in a ﬁxed (k + 1)-dimensional subspace. Since Γ(n, k)q is a subgraph of
the Grassmann graph, every maximal clique of Γ(n, k)q is the intersection of this
graph with a certain star or a top. However, there are maximal cliques of Γk(V )
which do not intersect Γ(n, k)q or intersect in non-maximal cliques. Also, maximal
cliques of the same type in Γ(n, k)q (the corresponding maximal cliques of Γk(V )
are of the same type) may be of diﬀerent sizes. The detailed description of maximal
cliques of Γ(n, k)q will be given in Section 4. Using this description, we prove our
main result (Theorem 2) in Section 5.

2. Grassmann graph

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld F (not necessarily ﬁnite).
Denote by Gk(V ) the Grassmannian consisting of all k-dimensional subspaces of
V . The Grassmann graph Γk(V ) is the graph whose vertex set is Gk(V ) and two
k-dimensional subspaces are adjacent vertices of this graph if their intersection is
(k − 1)-dimensional. In the cases when k = 1, n − 1, any two distinct vertices of
the Grassmann graph are adjacent. It is well-known that the Grassmann graph is
connected.

A bijection l : V → V ′, where V ′ is a vector space over a ﬁeld F ′, is a semilinear

isomorphism if

for all x, y ∈ V and there is a ﬁeld isomorphism σ : F → F ′ such that

l(x + y) = l(x) + l(y)

l(ax) = σ(a)l(x)

for every a ∈ F and x ∈ V . Every semilinear automorphism of V induces an
automorphism of the graph Γk(V ). In the case when n = 2k, the Grassmann graphs
Γk(V ) and Γk(V ∗) are isomorphic by duality and every semilinear isomorphism of
V to the dual vector space V ∗ induces an automorphism of Γk(V ).

Theorem 1 (W.L. Chow [3]). If 1 < k < n − 1, then every automorphism of
the Grassmann graph Γk(V ) is induced by a semilinear automorphism of V or a
semilinear isomorphism of V to V ∗ and the second possibility is realized only in the
case when n = 2k.

For k = 1, n − 1 the above statement fails. In these cases, every bijective trans-

formation of Gk(V ) is an automorphism of Γk(V ).

The proof of Chow’s theorem is based on the description of maximal cliques in

the Grassmann graph, see, for example, [2, 4, 6, 9].

Let S and U be incident subspaces of V such that dim S < k < dim U . We write
[S, U ]k for the set of all k-dimensional subspaces X satisfying S ⊂ X ⊂ U . In the
cases when S = 0 and U = V , this set will be denoted by hU ]k or [Sik, respectively.
Also, this set is called a line if

dim S = k − 1 and dim U = k + 1.

Note that the lines of the projective space ΠV (the projective space associated
to V ) are subsets of type hU ]1, where U is a 2-dimensional subspace. By the
Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry [1], every bijective transformation
of G1(V ) sending lines to subsets of lines is induced by a semilinear automorphism
of V .

There are precisely the following two types of maximal cliques in Γk(V ):

CHOW’S THEOREM FOR LINEAR CODES

• the stars [Sik, S ∈ Gk−1(V ),
• the tops hU ]k, U ∈ Gk+1(V ).

The intersection of two distinct stars is empty or it contains precisely one element;
the second possibility is realized only in the case when the corresponding (k − 1)-
dimensional subspaces are adjacent vertices of Γk−1(V ). Similarly, the intersection
of two distinct tops is empty or it contains precisely one element and the second
possibility is realized only if the associated (k + 1)-dimensional subspaces are ad-
jacent vertices of Γk+1(V ). The intersection of a star and a top is empty or a line;
in the second case, the corresponding (k − 1)-dimensional and (k + 1)-dimensional
subspaces are incident.

3. Graph of non-degenerate linear codes

Let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld consisting of q elements. Consider the n-dimensional

vector space

V = Fq × · · · × Fq

over this ﬁeld. The standard base of V is formed by the vectors

e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , en = (0, . . . , 0, 1).

Denote by Ci the kernel of the i-th coordinate functional (x1, . . . , xn) → xi.

A linear [n, k]q code is a k-dimensional subspaces of V . Following [8] we consider
non-degenerate linear codes only. A linear [n, k]q code C ⊂ V is non-degenerate if
the restriction of every coordinate functional to C is non-zero, in other words, C is
not contained in any coordinate hyperplane Ci.

All non-degenerate linear [n, k]q codes form the set

C(n, k)q = Gk(V ) \  n
[i=1

Gk(Ci)! .

Recall that the number of k-dimensional subspaces of V is equal to the Gaussian
coeﬃcient

=

(qn − 1)(qn−1 − 1) · · · (qn−k+1 − 1)

(q − 1)(q2 − 1) · · · (qk − 1)

;

in particular, the number of 1-dimensional subspaces and the number of hyperplanes
in V are equal to

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can show that the set C(n, k)q contains

Suppose that 1 < k < n − 1 and denote by Γ(n, k)q the restriction of the
Grassmann graph Γk(V ) to the set C(n, k)q. The graph Γ(n, k)q is connected [5,
Proposition 1].

A semilinear automorphism l of V is called monomial if l(ei) = eδ(i), where δ is
a permutation on the set [n] = {1, . . . , n}. Two linear [n, k]q codes are semilinearly
equivalent if there is a monomial semilinear automorphism of V transferring one

4

of them to the other. Every monomial semilinear automorphism of V induces an
automorphism of the graph Γ(n, k)q.

Our main result is the following analogue of Chow’s theorem.

Theorem 2. If 1 < k < n − 1, then every automorphism of the graph Γ(n, k)q is
induced by a monomial semilinear automorphism of V .

Remark 1. If q is a prime number, then the automorphism group of the ﬁeld Fq
is trivial. Otherwise, this is the cyclic group generated by the Frobenius automor-
phism.

4. Maximal cliques

In this section, we investigate maximal cliques of the graph Γ(n, k)q. We will

always suppose that 1 < k < n − 1.

Let S ∈ Gk−1(V ) and U ∈ Gk+1(V ). Recall that the star [Sik consists of all k-
dimensional subspaces containing S and the top hU ]k is formed by all k-dimensional
subspaces contained in U . If S ⊂ U , then the intersection of the star and the top
is the line [S, U ]k. The intersections of the star [Sik and the top hU ]k with C(n, k)q
are denoted by [Sic

k, respectively.
Stars and tops of Gk(V ) contain precisely

k and hU ]c

[n − k + 1]q and [k + 1]q

elements, respectively. Every line of Gk(V ) consists of q + 1 elements.

Since Γ(n, k)q is a subgraph of Γk(V ), every clique of Γ(n, k)q is a clique of
Γk(V ). So, every maximal clique of Γ(n, k)q is the intersection of C(n, k)q with a
star or a top. However, the intersection of a maximal clique of Γk(V ) with C(n, k)q
may be empty or a non-maximal clique of Γ(n, k)q.

For a (k − 1)-dimensional subspace S and a (k + 1)-dimensional subspace U we
k is a top of C(n, k)q only in the case

will say that [Sic
when this is a maximal clique of the graph Γ(n, k)q.

k is a star of C(n, k)q or hU ]c

4.1. Stars. If S belongs to C(n, k − 1)q, then the star [Sik is contained in C(n, k)q,
i.e. [Sik = [Sic
k is a star of C(n, k)q. In what follows, every such star will be called
maximal. If S does not belong to C(n, k − 1)q, then [Sic
k is a proper subset of [Sik.
Denote by c(S) the number of coordinate hyperplanes containing a subspace S.

For a (k − 1)-dimensional subspace this number is not greater than n − k + 1.

Lemma 1. If S is a (k − 1)-dimensional subspace of V which does not belong to
C(n, k − 1)q, then

|[Sic

k| = (q − 1)c(S)−1 · qn−k−c(S)+1.

Proof. Consider a generator matrix M for the subspace S, i.e. a matrix whose rows

form a base of S. Without loss of generality we can suppose that M =(cid:2) Ik−1 A (cid:3),

where Ik−1 is the identity (k − 1)-matrix and the last c(S) columns of the matrix
A are zero. It must be pointed out that each of the remaining columns of A is
non-zero. A generator matrix for any k-dimensional subspace containing S can be
obtained from M by adding a certain row vector v whose ﬁrst k − 1 coordinates
are 0 and v is not a linear combination of the rows from M . The corresponding k-
dimensional subspace will be denoted by X(v). This is an element of C(n, k)q only

CHOW’S THEOREM FOR LINEAR CODES

5

in the case when the last c(S) coordinates of v are distinct from 0. The remaining
n − (k − 1) − c(S) coordinates may be arbitrary. So, there are precisely

(q − 1)c(S) · qn−k−c(S)+1

possibilities for v. We have X(v) = X(w) if and only if w is a scalar multiple of v.
Therefore, there are precisely

(q − 1)c(S) · qn−k−c(S)+1

q − 1

distinct element of C(n, k)q containing S.

Proof. The statement is obvious if S is an element of C(n, k − 1)q. Consider the
case when S does not belong to C(n, k − 1)q. Lemma 1 shows that

(1)

|[Sic

k| ≥ (q − 1)n−k ≥ (q − 1)2 ≥ q + 1.

Suppose that [Sic
k is not a star of C(n, k)q, i.e. it is a non-maximal clique of Γ(n, k)q.
A maximal clique of Γ(n, k)q containing [Sic
k (since the intersection
of two distinct stars of Gk(V ) contains not greater than one element). Therefore,
[Sic
k is a subset of the line [S, U ]k. By our assumption, S is contained in at least
one coordinate hyperplane Ci. The corresponding k-dimensional subspace U ∩ Ci
belongs to the line [S, U ]k, but it is not an element of C(n, k)q. Since every line of
Gk(V ) consists of q + 1 elements, we have

k is a top hU ]c

|C(n, k)q ∩ [S, U ]k| ≤ q.

The line [S, U ]k contains [Sic

k and the latter inequality contradicts (1).

k is a

Proof. Suppose that S does not belong to C(n, k − 1)q and c(S) ≤ n− k − 1. Lemma
1 implies that

As in the proof of Proposition 1, we establish that [Sic
of Gk(V ) which guarantees that [Sic
k is a star of C(n, k)q.

|[Sic

k is not contained in a line

Consider the case when c(S) = n − k. As in the proof of Lemma 1, we suppose

that a generator matrix of S is M = (cid:2) Ik−1 A (cid:3) and the last n − k columns of

the matrix A are zero. We take the vectors v and w whose ﬁrst k − 1 coordinates
are 0 and whose last n − k coordinates are 1, and also the k-coordinates of v and
w are equal to 1 and 0, respectively. Then [Sic
k consists of X(v) and X(w). Let X
be the k-dimensional subspace spanned by the vectors

v, w + v1, . . . , w + vk−1,

where v1, . . . , vk−1 are the rows of the matrix M . This is an element of C(n, k)q
contained in the (k + 1)-dimensional subspace

U := X(v) + X(w).

On the other hand, X does not contain S. Therefore, [Sic
hU ]c

k. This means that [Sic

k is not a star of C(n, k)q.

k is a proper subset of

MARIUSZ KWIATKOWSKI, MARK PANKOV

If c(S) = n − k + 1, then [Sic

k contains only one element and cannot be a star of
(cid:3)

C(n, k)q.

4.2. Tops. Let U be a (k + 1)-dimensional subspace of V . If it does not belong
to C(n, k + 1)q, then hU ]c
k is empty. Suppose that U ∈ C(n, k + 1)q. Then every
k-dimensional subspace U ∩ Ci is an element of the top hU ]k which is not contained
in hU ]c

k. The subspaces

U ∩ C1, . . . , U ∩ Cn

need not to be mutually distinct, but this collection contains at least k + 1 distinct
elements. The latter follows from the fact that U ∗ is spanned by the restrictions
of the coordinate functionals to U . Since the top hU ]k contains precisely [k + 1]q
elements, we get the following lemma.

Lemma 2. If U ∈ C(n, k + 1)q, then

max{0, [k + 1]q − n} ≤ |hU ]c

k| ≤ [k + 1]q − k − 1.

Proposition 3. If 2k > n, then hU ]c

k is a top of C(n, k)q for every U ∈ C(n, k +1)q.

Proof. Since 2k > n, we have

[k + 1]q − n − (q + 1) ≥

qk+1 − q2

q − 1

− n =

q2(qk−1 − 1)

So, the number of elements in hU ]c

k is not contained in a line of Gk(V ) which gives the claim.

k is greater than the number of elements in a line
(cid:3)

Lemma 3. Let M be a generator matrix of U ∈ C(n, k + 1)q, i.e. a matrix whose
rows form a base for U . Then U ∩ Ci coincides with U ∩ Cj if and only if the
i-column of M is a scalar multiple of the j-column.

Proof. Let v1, . . . , vk+1 be the rows of the matrix M . Consider the k-dimensional
subspace U ∩ Ci and denote by r the smallest number for which vr does not belong
to U ∩ Ci. Let M and L be the sets of all p ∈ {r + 1, . . . , k + 1} such that vp belongs
to U ∩ Ci or does not belong to U ∩ Ci, respectively. Suppose that

M = {m1, . . . , mt} and L = {l1, . . . , ls}.

For every p ∈ {1, . . . , s} the subspace hvr, vlp i is not contained in U ∩ Ci, but there
is the unique non-zero scalar ap such that vr + apvlp belongs to U ∩ Ci. The vectors

(2)

v1, . . . , vr−1, vr + a1vl1 , . . . , vr + asvls , vm1 , . . . , vmt

form a base for U ∩ Ci. Then the i-coordinates of vectors

v1, . . . , vr−1, vm1 , . . . , vmt

are 0. Since U is not contained in Ci, the i-coordinate of vr is a non-zero scalar a
and the i-coordinate of every vlp is equal to −aa−1
p .

Similarly, we establish that the subspace U ∩ Cj is spanned by

v1, . . . , vr′−1, vr′ + b1vl′

, . . . , vr′ + bsvl′

The i-column and the j-column of M are formed by the i-coordinates and j-coordi-
nates of v1, . . . , vk+1, respectively. The vectors (2) and the vectors (3) span the
same k-dimensional subspace if and only if these columns are proportional.
(cid:3)

CHOW’S THEOREM FOR LINEAR CODES

Using Lemma 3, we establish the existence of U ∈ C(n, k + 1)q which does not
contain elements of C(n, k)q. Such elements of C(n, k + 1)q do not deﬁne tops of
C(n, k)q.

Example 1. Consider the linear [7, 3]2 code C whose generator matrix is

The columns of the matrix are mutually distinct and Lemma 3 guarantees that the
coordinate hyperplanes intersect C in 7 mutually distinct 2-dimensional subspaces.
On the other hand, C contains precisely [3]2 = 7 distinct 2-dimensional subspaces.
Therefore, it does not contain non-degenerated linear (7, 2)2 codes. Similarly, if
n = [k + 1]q, then we can construct a matrix of size (k + 1) × n over Fq whose
columns are non-zero and mutually distinct. Let U be the associated element of
C(n, k + 1)q. It contains precisely n = [k + 1]q distinct k-dimensional subspaces.
By Lemma 3, every k-dimensional subspace of U is contained in a certain Ci and
U does not contain elements of C(n, k)q.

Now, we show that hU ]c

k can be a non-empty subset in a line of Gk(V ). In this

case, it is not a top of C(n, k)q again.

Example 2. As above, we suppose that M is a generator matrix for U and
v1, . . . , vk+1 are the rows of this matrix. Consider the set W formed by all non-
zero vectors w = (w1, . . . , wk+1) whose scalar multiples do not appear as columns
in the matrix M . For every such vector w we denote by C(w) the k-dimensional
i=1 aivi, where scalars a1, . . . , ak+1 satisfy

Since w is not a scalar multiple of a certain column from M , the subspace C(w)
is not contained in any Ci (see the proof of Lemma 3). Thus, C(w) is an element
k is formed by all C(w). If w′ is a scalar multiple of w, then
of C(n, k)q and hU ]c
C(w) = C(w′). Suppose that there exist linearly independent vectors

5. Proof of Theorem 2

5.1. Two lemmas and reduction to the case k = 2. As in the previous section,
we suppose that 1 < k < n − 1. Every automorphism of Γ(n, k)q transfers maximal
cliques of Γ(n, k)q to maximal cliques. Recall that maximal cliques of this graph
are stars and tops of C(n, k)q.

Lemma 4. Every automorphism of Γ(n, k)q transfers maximal stars of C(n, k)q to
maximal stars.

Proof. Every maximal star of C(n, k)q contains precisely [n − k + 1]q elements and,
by Lemma 2, a top of C(n, k)q contains [k+1]q −l elements, where l ∈ {k+1, . . . , n}.
In the case when 2k ≤ n, we have

[n − k + 1]q ≥ [k + 1]q

and the number of elements in a maximal star is greater than the number of elements
in a top of C(n, k)q. If 2k > n, then

[k + 1]q − l − [n − k + 1]q ≥

qk+1 − qn−k+1

qn−k+1(q2k−n − 1)

− n ≥

≥ qn−k+1q2k−n−1 − n = qk − n ≥ 2k − n > 0,

i.e. the number of elements in any top of C(n, k)q is greater than the number of
elements in a maximal star. Therefore, an automorphism of Γ(n, k)q cannot transfer
maximal stars to tops of C(n, k)q. Since the number of elements in maximal stars
of C(n, k)q is greater than the numbers of elements in non-maximal stars, maximal
stars go to maximal stars.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5. Every automorphism of Γ(n, k)q transfers stars of C(n, k)q to stars.

Proof. Let f be an automorphism of Γ(n, k)q. Suppose that [Sic
star (S does not belong to C(n, k−1)q) such that f ([Sic
exists S′ ∈ C(n, k − 1)q such that the star [Sic

a non-empty intersection. This intersection consists of the k-dimensional subspace
S + S′. Hence the maximal star

intersects the top hU ]c
every element of the line [S′′, U ]k belongs to C(n, k)q. So, the intersection of [S′′ik

k is the line [S′′, U ]k and we get a contradiction.

Suppose that f is an automorphism of Γ(n, k)q and k ≥ 3. By Lemma 4, f sends
maximal stars to maximal stars and the same holds for the inverse automorphism
f −1. Therefore, f induces a bijective transformation fk−1 of C(n, k − 1)q such that

for every S ∈ C(n, k − 1)q. Then

f ([Sik) = [fk−1(S)ik

fk−1(hU ]c

k−1) = hf (U )]c

k−1

for every U ∈ C(n, k)q. This guarantees that fk−1 is an automorphism of Γ(n, k−1)q
(two distinct elements of C(n, k − 1)q are adjacent vertices of Γ(n, k − 1)q if and
only if there is an element of C(n, k)q containing them).

We apply the above arguments to fk−1 if k − 1 ≥ 3. Step by step, we construct
a sequence fk−1, . . . , f2, where every fi is an automorphism of Γ(n, i)q. As above,
we have

fi(hX]c

i ) = hfi+1(X)]c

i

for every X ∈ C(n, i + 1)q. This implies that

f2(hX]c

2) = hf (X)]c
2

for every X ∈ C(n, k)q. If f2 is induced by a semilinear automorphism l of V , then

f2(hX]c

2) = hl(X)]c
2

for every X ∈ C(n, k)q which means that f (X) = l(X), i.e. f is induced by l. So,
we need to prove Theorem 2 for the case when k = 2.

5.2. Proof of Theorem 2 for q ≥ 3 and k = 2. Let f be an automorphism of
Γ(n, 2)q and q ≥ 3. By Lemma 5, f transfers every star of C(n, 2)q to a star and the
same holds for the inverse automorphism f −1. Proposition 1 shows that f induces
a bijective transformation g of G1(V ) such that

for every P ∈ G1(V ). Then

f ([P ic

2) = [g(P )ic
2

g(hS]1) = hf (S)]1

for every S ∈ C(n, 2)q. In other words, g sends every line of the projective space ΠV
deﬁned by an element of C(n, 2)q to a line. We need to show that g transfers every
line of ΠV to a subset of a line. Then the Fundamental Theorem of Projective
Geometry implies that g is induced by a semilinear automorphism of V . As in
the previous subsection, we establish that f is induced by the same semilinear
automorphism.

It follows from Lemma 1 that the size of a star [P ic

2 depends only on the num-
ber c(P ), i.e. the number of coordinate hyperplanes containing P . Therefore, g
preserves this number, i.e.

c(g(P )) = c(P )

for every P ∈ G1(V ). In particular, g transfers every heii to heδ(i)i, where δ is a
permutation on [n].

Lemma 6. If P ∈ G1(V ) is contained in Ci, then g(P ) is contained in Cδ(i).

Proof. We take any 1-dimensional subspace Q containing a vector Pj6=i ajej such

that each of the n − 1 scalars aj is non-zero. Then

S = heii + Q ∈ C(n, 2)q

and we have

The equality

f (S) = heσ(i)i + g(Q).

c(g(Q)) = c(Q) = n − 1

scalars bj is non-zero.

implies that g(Q) is spanned by a vector Pj6=σ(i) bjej, where each of the n − 1

If g(P ) is not contained in Cσ(i), then g(P ) + g(Q) belongs to C(n, 2)q and the
2 have a non-empty intersection. On the other hand, P
(cid:3)

stars [g(P )ic
and Q both are contained in Ci and the stars [P ic

2 and [g(Q)ic

2 and [Qic

2 are disjoint.

Let S be a 2-dimensional subspace which does not belong to C(n, 2)q. Then it is

contained in a certain Ci. Show that g sends the line hS]1 to a subset of a line.

Let us take two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces P1, P2 ⊂ S. We state that
there exists Q ∈ C(n, 1)q such that the 2-dimensional subspace Q + P1 contains a
certain Q′ ∈ C(n, 1)q distinct from Q. Let x = (x1, . . . , xn) be a non-zero vector of
P1. Since q ≥ 3, there exists a vector y = (y1, . . . , yn), where every yi is non-zero
and distinct from −xi. The 1-dimensional subspaces

Q = hyi and Q′ = hx + yi

are as required. It is clear that

Q + P1, Q + P2, Q′ + P2

form a clique of Γ(n, 2)q which is not contained in a star. Therefore, hS + Q]c
2 is a
top of C(n, 2)q. This top intersects the maximal star [Qi2 in the line [Q, S + Q]2.
Since f ([Qi2) is a maximal star and the intersection of two distinct stars contains
at most one element, f transfers hS + Q]c

2 to a certain top hU ]c
2.

Let P be a 1-dimensional subspace of S. Then P + Q is an element of hS + Q]c
2
and f (P + Q) belongs to hU ]c
2. We get the inclusion g(P ) ⊂ U . On the other
hand, Lemma 6 states that g(P ) is contained in Cδ(i). Therefore, g(P ) is in the
2-dimensional subspace S′ = U ∩ Cσ(i). So, g transfers the line hS]1 to a subset of
the line hS′]1.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, g is induced by a semi-
linear automorphism of V . Since it sends every heii to heσ(i)i, this semilinear
automorphism is monomial.

5.3. Proof of Theorem 2 for q = 2 and k = 2. Let f be an automorphism of
Γ(n, 2)2 and n ≥ 4.

For every subset I = {i1, . . . , ik} ⊂ [n] we deﬁne

PI := hei1 + · · · + eik i.

Since q = 2, each element of G1(V ) is a certain PI . By Proposition 2, the subset
[PI ic
2 is a star of C(n, 2)2 if and only if |I| ≥ 3. We will write X for the subset

CHOW’S THEOREM FOR LINEAR CODES

of G1(V ) consisting of all PI satisfying this condition. It follows from Lemma 5
that f induces a bijective transformation g of X such that PI ∈ X is contained in
S ∈ C(n, 2)2 if and only if g(PI ) is contained in f (S).

By Lemma 1, two stars [PI ic

2 have the same number of elements if
and only if |I| = |J|. Hence, the equality g(PI ) = PJ implies that |I| = |J|. In
particular, g lives ﬁxed P[n] (the 1-dimensional subspace containing e1 + · · · + en).
Also, for every i ∈ [n] we have

2 and [PJ ic

g(P[n]\{i}) = P[n]\{δ(i)},

where δ is a permutation on the set [n]. Therefore, g transfers every PI ∈ X to
Pσ(I) if n = 4. We want to show that the same holds for n > 4.

In this case, for any distinct i, j ∈ [n] the set [P[n]\{i,j}ic

This star has a non-empty intersection with the star [P[n]\{t}ic
when t 6= i, j. This implies that

2 is a star of C(n, 2)2.
2 only in the case

g(P[n]\{i,j}) = P[n]\{δ(i),δ(j)}.

Similarly, we establish that g sends every PI ∈ X to Pσ(I).

Let l be the linear automorphism of V transferring every xi to xσ(i). The compo-
sition l−1f is an automorphism of Γ(n, 2)2 and the associated transformation of X
is identity. In other words, l−1f leaves ﬁxed every star of C(n, 2)2. In the case when
n ≥ 5, every element of C(n, 2)2 is contained in at least two distinct stars. This
means that l−1f is identity, i.e. f is induced by l.

Suppose that n = 4. Then S ∈ C(4, 2)2 is contained in precisely one star if and
only if S = PI + PJ , where I and J are 2-element subsets and I ∪ J = [4]. The
remaining elements of C(4, 2)2 are preserved by l−1f . Consider, for example,

It intersects

S = P{1,2} + P{3,4}.

S′ = P{1,3,4} + P{2,3,4}

precisely in P{1,2}. Then l−1f (S) intersects l−1f (S′) = S′ in a certain 1-dimensional
subspace. Since l−1f transfers every star of C(4, 2)2 to itself, this intersection cannot
be P{1,3,4} or P{2,3,4}; hence it is P{1,2}. Also, S contains P[4] and the same holds for
l−1f (S). So, l−1f (S) contains both P{1,2} and P[4] which implies that it coincides
with S. The same arguments show that l−1f leaves ﬁxed every PI + PJ , where I
and J are 2-element subsets and I ∪ J = [4].
