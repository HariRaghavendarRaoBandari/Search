Abstract

We consider the Ising model between 2 and 4 dimensions perturbed by quenched

disorder in the strength of the interaction between nearby spins. In the interval 2 < d < 4

this disorder is a relevant perturbation that drives the system to a new ﬁxed point of

the renormalization group. At d = 2 such disorder is marginally irrelevant and can be

studied using conformal perturbation theory. Combining conformal perturbation theory

with recent results from the conformal bootstrap we compute some scaling exponents in

an expansion around d = 2.

If one trusts these computations also in d = 3, one ﬁnds

results consistent with experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we

perform a direct uncontrolled computation in d = 3 using new results for low-lying operator

dimensions and OPE coeﬃcients in the 3d Ising model. We compare these new methods

with previous studies. Finally, we comment about the O(2) model in d = 3, where we

predict a large logarithmic correction to the infrared scaling of disorder.

1. Disorder in the Ising Model

Imagine that the interaction strength between nearby spins in the Ising model, Jhiji,
(where hiji denotes that i and j are neighboring spins) is approximately given by some
constant J, but the ﬂuctuations around J are sampled from a normal distribution with

a ﬁxed standard deviation much smaller than J itself. We may say that the interaction

strength is subject to a weak, quenched disorder. Even though the disorder is arbitrarily

weak, it may have profound eﬀects on the infrared behavior of the theory. In particular, at

the phase transition, the critical exponents may change. This problem arises in a variety

of physical applications, see for example [1] for a review. Near the phase transition, one

can study the problem using the tools of Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory.

In the Landau-Ginzburg description of the Ising ﬁxed point, the energy operator,

ǫ(x), corresponds to tuning the temperature slightly away from the critical temperature.

In other words, if we deform the action (i.e. Hamiltonian) at the ﬁxed point as

S → S + hZ ddx ǫ(x),

1

(1.1)

then to ﬁrst order h ∼ T − Tc. In fact, we can promote h to a source, h(x), and imagine
that T − Tc varies in space h(x) ∼ T (x) − Tc. One can alternatively think of h(x) as
corresponding to the deviation of the interaction strength from its mean h(x) ∼ J − J(x).
What we would like to study is the situation where h(x) is a random variable with

Gaussian distribution of width c:

h(x)h(y) ∼ c2δ(x − y).

(1.2)

To study the disordered system we can imagine computing the ordinary free energy F [h(x)]

e−F[h(x)] =Z [Dσ(x)]e−S−R ddxh(x)ǫ(x),

(1.3)

where [Dσ(x)] denotes a path integral over conﬁgurations of Ising spins. The disordered
free energy can be obtained by averaging over h(x):

FD =Z [Dh(x)]F [h(x)]e− 1

2c2R ddxh2(x).

(1.4)

The critical properties of the disordered system can be read from the disordered free energy

as usual.

Let us now review the Harris criterion [2]. From (1.3) we see that it is natural to assign
to h dimension [h] = d − ∆ǫ. Then the dimension of the strength of disorder is obtained
from (1.4) [c2] = d− 2∆ǫ. Therefore, if d < 2∆ǫ disorder decays in the infrared and we say
that it is irrelevant; The critical properties of the phase transition are unaltered by disorder.
If d ≥ 2∆ǫ then disorder is relevant or marginal and may induce a renormalization group
ﬂow to a new ﬁxed point.

Recall that the heat-capacity exponent is deﬁned as

α ≡

d − 2∆ǫ
d − ∆ǫ

,

(1.5)

and therefore disorder is irrelevant if α < 0, marginal if α = 0, and relevant if α > 0.
The case α = 0 is especially interesting as there are logarithms and a beta function for c2

can be deﬁned. Furthermore, one can imagine that in favourable circumstances one can

use the tools of conformal perturbation theory in order to systematically compute critical

exponents in an expansion in α.

In the 3d Ising model we have ∆ǫ ∼ 1.41 and therefore α ∼ 0.11 > 0 which means
that the disorder is relevant. However, in the 2d Ising model ∆ǫ = 1 and thus α = 0, so

2

disorder is marginal. As we will review, it turns out that it is marginally irrelevant. The

conformal bootstrap techniques [3] show that in 2 + ε dimensions, for small enough ε,

∆ǫ = 1 + 0.3ε + O(ε2),

α = 0.4ε + O(ε2).

(1.6)

In other words, the heat capacity is small and positive for ε > 0. In combination with

the fact that the disorder is marginally irrelevant in d = 2, this means that there is a

perturbatively accessible ﬁxed point for small enough ε. Our goal is to compute some of

the simplest properties of this disordered ﬁxed point and compare the naive extrapolation

to d = 3 with experimental and Monte Carlo data. We also attempt an uncontrolled

expansion directly in d = 3 using new results for low-lying operator dimensions and OPE

coeﬃcients in the 3d Ising model, computed with numerical bootstrap techniques.

Since α = 0 also holds true in d = 4, one can study the random bond Ising model in

an expansion around four dimensions [4,5,6]. However, in d = 4 there are two marginal

operators, namely, the strength of disorder (1.4) and also the usual quartic interaction
σ4. The RG ﬂow occurs in a two-dimensional space and one ﬁnds a certain degeneracy at

one loop, namely, one combination remains undetermined. This renders the expansion an

expansion in √d − 4. It is somewhat ineﬀective, at least at low orders. For example, the

sign of the heat capacity in the disordered ﬁxed point evaluated from the ﬁrst nontrivial
order is incorrect.1 (In theories where disorder is relevant in the ultraviolet, one would

generally expect that it would be irrelevant in the infrared. Hence, while in such theories
α ≥ 0 in the ultraviolet, one generally expects that α ≤ 0 in the infrared. This is why
the sign of the infrared heat-capacity exponent is crucial. The statement that we expect
α ≤ 0 can be put on rigorous grounds, see [8].)

In d = 2, there are no marginal operators in the Ising model other than disorder (1.4)

and the expansion is thus expected to be rather eﬀective.

Our strategy in expanding around d = 2 is very similar to the standard epsilon
expansion [9].2 The main conceptual diﬀerence being that we are not expanding around a

Gaussian point in the ultraviolet, rather, we are expanding around a nontrivial ultraviolet

conformal ﬁeld theory (which is, however, quite well understood). The potential utility

1 See, for example, [7] for higher order computations.
2 Recently there was renewed activity and interest in the epsilon expansion, mostly motivated
by potential applications for quantum phase transitions. See, for example, [10-15] and references

therein.

3

of such an expansion for the random bond model has been already foreseen in section 8

of [16]. For other related works see [17-20]. In particular, [17] studied the disordered d = 2

Potts model by an expansion in the number of spin components. The general framework

of a controlled expansion around a nontrivial ﬁxed point with a weakly relevant operator

has had various applications. For example, the computation of central charges in such

renormalization group ﬂows (including in disordered theories) can be found in [21].

2. The Replica Method

A popular approach to studying the disordered free energy (1.4) is via the replica
method. In this note our main interest will be in theories where c2 remains small under
renormalization group transformations and one can thus attempt a series expansion in c2.

In this case, the replica method can be viewed simply as a convenient book-keeping device.

The analytic continuation necessary in the replica method is guaranteed to exist.

We deﬁne

Wn ≡Z [Dh]e−nF[h(x)]e−R ddx h(x)h(x)

2c2

,

(2.1)

where e−F[h(x)] is deﬁned in (1.3). We can compute the averaged disordered free energy
from

In order to compute (2.1) we need a convenient expression for e−nF[h(x)]. For integer

n, this can be achieved by introducing n decoupled copies of the model

(2.3)

where capital Latin indices go over the replicas, A = 1, . . . , n. We therefore have the path

nYA=1

[DσA]e−PA

SA−PAR ddxh(x)ǫA(x).

We solve the h path integral ﬁrst. The equation of motion of h sets h(x) = −c2PA ǫA(x)

and thus

.

Therefore, we have a collection of n identical CFTs perturbed by some operator,

PA,B ǫA(x)ǫB(x), with coupling c2.

The interaction PA,B ǫA(x)ǫB(x) is relevant as long as ∆ǫ < d/2 and marginal if

∆ǫ = d/2. For the Isingd model, it is therefore relevant for 2 < d < 4 and marginal if

d = 2 or d = 4. See Fig 1.

Figure 1: In d = 2, 4 disorder is marginal while in the interval d ∈ (2, 4) disorder is
relevant and drives the theory to a new ﬁxed point. (We will see that the situation in d = 4
is actually more subtle than what the ﬁgure suggests.)

Let us consider the two marginal cases, d = 2 and d = 4, in detail. One has to be

careful about the case when the two indices in the sumPA,B ǫA(x)ǫB(x) coincide, A = B.

In d = 2 the OPE of two energy operators does not contain marginal operators and thus

one can throw away the terms A = B (they only renormalize the energy of the ground

state and do not aﬀect the anomalous dimensions). However, in d = 4 the OPE of two
energy operators (ǫ = 1√2

φ2, φ(x)φ(0) ∼ 1

x2 + . . .) takes the form
2√2
x2 ǫ(0) + ǫ2(0) + . . . ,

(2.6)

where descendants have not been included in the OPE above. Therefore the terms with

A = B can be taken to stand for the ǫ2(0) operator. Since the operatorPA ǫ2

with the permutation symmetry between the replicas, we have to add it to the action.

A is consistent

To summarize, in the two marginal cases corresponding to d = 2 and d = 4, we have

to study the following theories

where in the interaction term between the replicas, the terms with A = B are inter-
preted simply as ǫ2
A(x). We have included the coupling λ2 even though it is marginally
irrelevant in the four-dimensional pure Ising model for reasons that will be clariﬁed

below.

We can study the d = 4 theory using ordinary Feynman diagrams, but the theory in

d = 2 must be studied using conformal perturbation theory. We therefore begin with an

extensive review of some aspects of conformal perturbation theory that will be useful in

what follows.

3. Review of Conformal Perturbation Theory

Consider an operator O with dimension ∆O = d − δ. We will be interested in the
case where O is marginal, corresponding to δ = 0, and also the case where O is slightly
relevant, 0 < δ ≪ 1. We assume that its OPE takes the form

O(x)O(0) ∼

1

x2∆O

+

COOO
x∆O O(0) + . . . .

(3.1)

Of course, the OPE may also contain various relevant operators, and it must contain the

energy-momentum tensor. We will comment on the eﬀects of these terms later.

Imagine deforming the partition function by

egR ddx O(x).

(3.2)

We can determine the beta function for g by demanding that a physical observable be

UV-cutoﬀ independent. A simple observable to compute is the overlap between the state
hO| given by an insertion of

O(∞) ≡ lim
x→∞

x2∆OO(x),

(3.3)

and the state |0ig,V given by deforming the conformal theory with (3.2) in a region of
volume V around the origin (we abuse notation and write V for both the region and its

volume),

|0ig,V ≡ egRV

ddxO(x)|0i.

(3.4)

The restriction of the integral to V ensures that the various integrated operators stay away

from the insertion at inﬁnity. In this way we are studying the renormalization of the unit

operator, i.e. the free energy.

Expanding in g we ﬁnd

hO|0ig,V = hO(∞)i + gZV

ddx ddx1 ddx2hO(x)O(x1)O(x2)O(∞)i + . . . .

Since we are interested in short distance divergences, we can set x = 0 and replaceRV ddx

with a volume factor V , ignoring x-dependent boundary eﬀects in the integrals over x1,2.

Then we have

hO|0ig,V ∼ V g +

(3.6)

where “∼” means that both sides have the same UV-divergences. Here we have used that
the one-point function hO(∞)i vanishes and that hO(0)O(∞)i = 1.

The beta function up to two-loop order can be computed from divergences in the three-

point and four-point functions in (3.6). For later convenience, we review this using two
diﬀerent regulators. First, we consider the marginal case ∆O = d with a cutoﬀ regulator
at the scale µ. Second, we consider the slightly relevant case ∆O = d − δ, δ ≪ 1, using
minimal subtraction of poles in δ.

3.1. Marginal Case with Cutoﬀ Regulator

Suppose that O is marginal, ∆(O) = d. The expansion (3.6) has logarithms depending
on the cutoﬀ. We absorb them by assuming that the eﬀective coupling evolves with scale

as g(µ). We demand that under a renormalization group transformation the logarithms

sum up in such a way that the answer is µ-independent. The beta function is deﬁned as

usual

d

d log µ

g(µ) = β(g(µ)) = β1g2 + β2g3 + . . . .

Let us assume the integrated correlation functions in (3.6) diverge as

ZV

ddx1hO(0)O(x1)O(∞)i ∼ A log µ,

ddx1ddx2hO(0)O(x1)O(x2)O(∞)i ∼ B log2 µ + C log µ.

g3(µ)(cid:0)B log2 µ + C log µ(cid:1)(cid:19) = 0.

with the last equation being the usual consistency condition that relates the logarith-

Γ(d/2) is the volume of the unit (d − 1)-sphere, and hence

β(g) = −

Sd−1COOOg2 + . . . .

(3.12)

Let us explain why A2 = 2

3 B is satisﬁed. In (3.9) we have three regions of divergences,
i.e. from the three points 0, x1, x2 we can choose which pair is the closest in distance. If

|x1| ≪ |x2| < 1 then the OPE in the channel |x1| → 0 will give an integral COOOR ddx1/xd
which needs to be cutoﬀ at |x2| and thus we get Sd−1COOO log(µ|x2|). The remaining

two-loops can be extracted.

The integrated four-point functionR ddx1ddx2hO(0)O(x1)O(x2)O(∞)i can be simpli-

ﬁed since the integrand depends only on conformal cross-ratios. We have the two cross

ratios

u = |x2|2
|x1|2 ,

v = |x1 − x2|2

|x1|2

.

The four-point function can be written as

hO(0)O(x1)O(x2)O(∞)i =

|x1|
We write the integration measure in spherical coordinates,

|x1|2d F(cid:18)|x2|

(3.14)

ddx1ddx2 = Sd−1Sd−2|x1|d−1|x2|d−1 sind−2(Θ)d|x1|d|x2|dΘ,

(3.15)

with Θ being the angle between x1 and x2.

8

It is convenient to perform a change of variables x2 → x2|x1| which brings the integral

to the form

Sd−1Z d|x1|

|x1| Z ddx2F (x2) .

(3.16)

Henceforth, we may redeﬁne F to be the connected four-point function, since the discon-

nected piece does not contribute logarithmic divergences:

hO(0)O(e1)O(x2)O(∞)ic = F (x2),

(3.17)

with e1 = (1, 0, 0, . . .) a unit vector in the 1-direction. The expression (3.16) is diver-
gent. Indeed, it has the double logarithmic divergences that follow from the one-loop beta
function according to (3.11).3 The double-log needs to be carefully subtracted in order to

compute C in (3.10).

A simple trick to subtract the double-log is the following. One can consider generalized

free ﬁeld theory, deformed by a double trace operator. In this theory the beta function is

one-loop exact. Therefore, one can subtract the double-log without aﬀecting the single-log.

This procedure respects all the symmetries. The derivation is in appendix A. This leads

to the following expression

β = −

The coeﬃcient of g3 is now a manifestly convergent integral.4

(x − e1)d(cid:19)(cid:19) g3 + . . . .

(3.18)

3 It is instructive to re-derive the coeﬃcient of the double-log from the expression (3.16). There
are three regions with a C 2
OOO/xd singularity, namely, x2 → {0, 1, ∞}. But the cutoﬀ in the x2
coordinate is rescaled by x1 because of the change of variables. Therefore we get the integral
3C 2

log2(µ), which precisely agrees with (3.11).

|x1| log(|x1|) ∼

4 This is unless there are relevant operators in the OPE of O(x)O(0) (other than the unit
operator). Let us consider one such, normalized (hΨ(0)Ψ(∞)i = 1), relevant operator Ψ of
dimension ∆Ψ < d such that the coeﬃcient CΨ, deﬁned as

OOOR d|x1|

O(x)O(0) ∼

CΨ

x2d−∆Ψ

Ψ(0)

(3.19)

is non-vanishing. This leads to a power divergence in (3.18). We have to tune this away. For
example, in the region that x2 → 0 we simply subtract

(3.20)

Finally, let us explain in what sense the procedure leading to (3.18) is indeed unique.

Diﬀerent schemes correspond to contact terms. And since we are dealing here with inte-

grated correlation functions, (3.8), (3.9), δ-function singularities may contribute. We can

for instance imagine introducing the contact term

O(x)O(y) ∼ α δ(d)(x − y)O(x),

(3.22)

with α some arbitrary coeﬃcient. From (3.6) we see that this amounts to a change of vari-
ables g → g + 1
2 αg2. However, it is well known that the ﬁrst two terms in the beta function
are invariant under this change of variables.5 Therefore, (3.18) is scheme independent.

3.2. Slightly Relevant Case

We will also need to understand the case where O is slightly relevant (∆O = d − δ

with 0 < δ ≪ 1). There are two scenarios that one might consider:
1. We have a family of CFTs where δ is a continuous parameter that can be dialed to

zero. Assuming the CFT data has an analytic power-series expansion in δ, we can

then regulate the deformed theory by minimal subtraction. Speciﬁcally, we compute

integrals like (3.6) as a Laurent series in δ, and then add counterterms to cancel the

poles. Physical observables (like IR scaling dimensions) will be scheme-independent,

More generally, (3.18) is modiﬁed to

(3.21)

If we sum over all the relevant operators, the integral (3.21) becomes convergent. Note that the
OPE of O(x)O(0) necessarily contains the stress tensor, but this leads to no divergence in the
integral (3.18) due to the angular dependence of the leading OPE term.

5 Indeed, assume

βg = β1g2 + β2g3 + . . . .

(3.23)

Now perform an analytic change of variables g′ = g + 1
we have

2 αg2 + . . .. It turns out that α cancels and

βg′ = β1g′2 + β2g′3 + . . . .

(3.24)

and in principle can be computed to arbitrary order using these techniques. An
example of this situation is the usual Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point in 4 − ǫ dimensions.
An example where the spacetime dimension does not vary is the Potts model where q

is regarded as a continuous parameter.

2. We might have an isolated CFT where δ just happens to be numerically small.

In this case, the Laurent expansion of integrals like (3.6) becomes ambiguous be-
yond the leading nonzero order. For example, without an expansion COOO(δ) =
COOO(0) + δC′
OOO(0) + . . . , we cannot compute subleading terms in expressions in-
volving COOO. In this scenario, minimal subtraction does not work. In fact, there is
no scheme-independent expression for subleading corrections to physical observables

in conformal perturbation theory. This is ultimately because the IR theory lives at

the end of a nontrivial RG ﬂow. To learn about it, we must perform a nonpertur-

bative diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian, perhaps using conformal truncation

methods [22] (see also more recent work [23]). An example of this situation is the
disordered 3d Ising model, where δ ≈ 0.18. We will only be able to compute the
leading nonzero contributions to disordered observables as an expansion in δ. In some
cases these contributions occur at one loop, and in others at two loops.6

For the moment, let us assume that scenario (1) is valid, and discuss how to compute

quantities with minimal subtraction. Subsequently, we discuss which quantities are scheme-

independent in scenario (2).

The nonzero value of δ serves as a UV regulator for the integrals that appear in
conformal perturbation theory. Finite results in the limit δ → 0 can be obtained by
subtracting poles in δ. Speciﬁcally, we deform the theory with a bare coupling

g0 = µδ(cid:18)g + g2 a

δ

δ(cid:19) + . . .(cid:19) ,

(3.25)

where the counterterms are chosen to subtract poles in δ. Since the regulator is independent

of µ, physical observables will be µ-independent if g0 itself is µ-independent,

0 =

d log µ

.

(3.26)

6 As we explain in section 8, the disordered 3d Ising model can be also viewed as a perturbation

around (very close to) the disordered O(2) model, thereby making it controllable.

(3.27)

together with the relation between counterterms b = a2.

Plugging the bare coupling g0 into the expansion (3.6) for hO|0ig0,V , and choosing

a, b, c to cancel UV-divergences using minimal subtraction, we obtain

where (. . .)δ−1 means the term proportional to δ−1 in a Laurent expansion in δ.

Let us now give a more precise prescription for computing these quantities. We should
ﬁnd that the results agree with the expressions for βk found in the previous subsection.
From the ﬁrst integral, we easily obtain β1 = − 1
2 Sd−1COOO as before. Note that here
COOO stands for the OPE coeﬃcient evaluated with δ = 0. (This OPE coeﬃcient, and,
more generally, all the other CFT data are allowed to depend on δ smoothly.)

For the second integral, it is convenient to isolate divergences by breaking the inte-

gration into three regions R12, R23, R31 given by

R12 : |x12| < |x13|, |x23|

(3.29)

and cyclic permutations. Each region contributes equally, giving a factor of 3. Within
R12, we may cancel the factor of V and set x1 = 0. We then use rotational invariance to
set x3 = re1, giving

line, we performed the integral over r to obtain an overall pole in δ.7

7 The conformal cross-ratio z in this conﬁguration is given by z = (x · e1) + i|x − (x · e1)e1|, so

that R = {z : |z| < 1, |z| < |1 − z|}.

The remaining integral has a single divergence as x → 0. (Other divergences are not
present because x is restricted to the region R, away from the other operator insertions.)
The form of this divergence can be computed from the O term in the O × O OPE, and it
can be subtracted to give

(3.31)

Since in (3.28) we are instructed to extract the term δ−1, in (3.31) the subtraction is
again with the OPE coeﬃcient evaluated at δ = 0. (As we have explained in the previous
subsection, other prescriptions would diﬀer by contact terms in the OPE of OO but those
cancel out in the ﬁnal answer at this order.) If additional relevant operators are present
in the O × O OPE, we isolate their contributions and integrate by analytic continuation
in their dimensions. This is equivalent to cancelling the associated power-law divergences

with counterterms. Although it is not obvious, one can check by isolating the contribution
of O in the O × O OPE that (3.31) agrees with (3.18) and (3.21) in the limit δ → 0.

The form (3.31) is well-suited for computation using the conformal block expansion.
Because the integral is restricted to the region R, we only need to keep a few terms in the
expansion of hOOOOi to get a good approximation.

3.3. Anomalous Dimensions

It remains to review operator renormalization and anomalous dimensions in confor-

mal perturbation theory. Consider some operator Φ and let us deform the action by

λR ddx Φ(x) (in addition to the deformation by O). As before, we compute the overlap

hΦ|0iλ,g,V and demand that the result is independent of the UV cutoﬀ. We keep terms
that are linear in λ but all orders in g. Let us assume Φ is canonically normalized and has

the OPE

O(x)Φ(0) ∼
We discuss here the marginal case ∆O = d.

CΦΦO

We thus have, analogously to (3.6),

is scheme dependent.
From (3.34) we readily see that this corresponds to the change of variables λ → λ+αλg+....
As long as γΦ,1 6= 0 (i.e. CΦΦO 6= 0), this renders γΦ,2 scheme dependent; the contact term
Φ(x)O(0) ∼ αδ(d)(x)Φ(x) shifts it as γΦ,2 → γΦ,2 + αγΦ,1.

Therefore, we must choose some scheme when providing a formula for γΦ,2. One
possible choice is to cut a small hole around Φ(0) or, equivalently, choose α = 0. As
before we can replace hΦOOΦi with the connected correlator and subtract a contribution
from generalized free ﬁeld theory deformed by a double trace operator. The procedure is

explained in appendix A. One ﬁnds

3.4. Finite RG Flows and Scheme Dependence

Finally, let us comment on which quantities are physically meaningful when δ is small

but ﬁxed. In this case, conformal perturbation theory is only a controlled approximation
at distances x ≪ 1/µ, where µ is the scale associated with the deformation. In particular,
it does not give a controlled expansion for IR quantities like scaling dimensions in the

deformed theory. However, we can proceed (non-rigorously) as follows. Let us pretend
that a continuous family of CFTs with δ → 0 exists, but that we only know the CFT data
at one (small) value δ = δ∗. The data at δ = 0 (where conformal perturbation theory is
well-deﬁned) could then diﬀer by O(δ∗). In practice, this means we can trust quantities
computed with minimal subtraction at leading nonzero order. At subleading order, there

are ambiguities due to our ignorance.

In general, only the leading β-function coeﬃcient β1 and leading anomalous dimension
γΦ,1 are unambiguous in this case. This can be seen explicitly in (3.39): if we redeﬁne COOO
and CΦΦO at order δ, this gives a nontrivial contribution to γΦ,2 at order δ0. However, if
CΦΦO vanishes, then γΦ,2 becomes unambiguous. We will encounter both situations below.

4. The Random-Bond Ising Model with d = 4 − 1
2eε

This section begins by studying the random-bond Ising model in d = 4 (2.8). To that

end, we use conformal perturbation theory at one-loop, as reviewed in the previous section.
We then discuss the model in d = 4 − 1

All we need for the present study are the OPE coeﬃcients in free ﬁeld theory between
2 φ4. Here is a summary of all the

various products of the operator ǫ = 1√2

φ2 and ǫ2 = 1

2eε dimensions.

λ2 = 6λ2(cid:0)3λ2 − 2c2(cid:1) ,
c2 = c2(cid:0)12λ2 − (n + 8)c2(cid:1) .

The reason that the coupling c2 does not by itself lead to a term proportional to λ and vice
versa is easily understood from symmetries: If c2 = 0 then it must remain so because the
n copies are decoupled. If λ2 = 0 it must remain so because the coupling c2 respects an

O(n) symmetry (and not just a permutation symmetry) which is clearly visible in terms

of the microscopic ﬁelds.

Let us now take n → 0 as appropriate for the disordered theory. We get

d

d log µ

λ2 = 6λ2(cid:0)3λ2 − 2c2(cid:1) ,
c2 = 4c2(cid:0)3λ2 − 2c2(cid:1) .

1. If disorder is absent, then the coupling λ2 is marginally irrelevant, which, of course,

is very well known.

16

2. If we take pure Mean Field Theory (i.e. λ2 = 0) in d = 4 and introduce disorder in

temperature, the theory, at least initially, ﬂows to strong coupling because the beta

function for c2 is negative!

3. Disorder renders the coupling λ2 relevant, as the dimension of the interaction propor-

tional to λ2 becomes ∆ǫ2 = 4 − 12c2.

4. The one-loop approximation has a line of ﬁxed points with 2c2 = 3λ2. This degeneracy

disappears at higher orders. This line of ﬁxed points is attractive for λ2 but unstable

under disorder perturbations.

We thus conclude that, strictly speaking, the random-bond mean-ﬁeld-theory in d = 4

is non-perturbative in the infrared. The ﬁxed points on the line 3λ2 = 2c2 are unstable.

Furthermore, they disappear at higher order.
Let us now study the system in d = 4− 1

2eε dimensions. For that, to leading order, we

c2 = −eεc2 + 4c2(cid:0)3λ2 − 2c2(cid:1) .

(4.6)

Unfortunately, because the one-loop approximation has a line of ﬁxed points, there is no

solution with λ2, c2 ∼eε.

If one assumes λ2 = 0 one ﬁnds that the theory ﬂows to strong coupling.

If one

assumes c2 = 0 then one ﬁnds the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point with λ2 = 1
Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point the anomalous dimension of disorder is 4 − 1
that the Wilson-Fisher ﬁxed point is now a UV ﬁxed point. This is consistent with our

18eε. At this
3eε, which means

general picture that disorder is relevant in the Ising model everywhere between 2 < d < 4

(i.e. that the heat capacity in the pure Ising model is positive for all 2 < d < 4). See Fig 1.

A weakly coupled infrared ﬁxed point can be found when one includes higher-order

corrections to (4.6), but this results in an expansion in √
eε, which is less eﬀective than the
standardeǫ expansion. For example, the ﬁrst few nontrivial corrections to the infrared heat

capacity in d = 3 do not give the correct sign. See [7] and references therein.

17

5. Disordered Theories and Conformal Perturbation Theory

In this section we apply the results of sections 2 and 3 to a general conformal ﬁeld

theory in which disorder is a marginal or a nearly-marginal perturbation. The results we

obtain here could be useful in a variety of models, and in particular, they will be useful in

the two sections that follow.

To set up the problem, recall that we are considering the following partition function

Wn =Z

nYA=1

[DσA]e−PA

SA+ c2

2 R ddxPA6=B

ǫA(x)ǫB (x)

,

(5.1)

with SA being the action of some d-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory in which there is

an operator, ǫA, of dimension close to d/2. The n-copies are identical and decoupled if
c2 = 0.

We assume that the unperturbed pure CFT does not have an operator ǫ2, i.e. we

assume that the OPE in the pure theory is of the form

ǫ(x)ǫ(0) =

1

x2∆ǫ

+

Cǫǫǫ
x∆ǫ

ǫ(0) + vanishing as x → 0.

(5.2)

We assume that ∆ǫ is either d/2 or parametrically close to d/2.

The assumption (5.2) renders our discussion inapplicable for non-generic theories like
that of section 4 (which is mean-ﬁeld theory, so the operator ǫ2 exists) or large-N theories,
where if ǫ is a single trace operator then ǫ2 is a double-trace operator. But our discussion

is relevant in many other cases. The non-generic cases can be treated separately as in

section 4. The case of ǫ being a single-trace operator in a large-N theory was treated

in [24]. See also references therein.

For what follows we will need the various OPEs in which the interaction term

We are now ready to proceed with one- and two-loop computations in the replicated

theory.

5.1. One Loop

First, let us assume ∆ǫ = d/2. Then, using (3.12) and the OPE coeﬃcient COOO

found in (5.6) we obtain the beta function

The beta function for the physical disordered theory is obtained by simply substituting

c2(cid:19) = −Sd−1(cid:18)2 −

C2

ǫǫǫ(cid:19) + O(c2).

(5.11)

This shows that in the marginal case, unless the OPE coeﬃcient Cǫǫǫ is larger than 2,

disorder decays back to the pure CFT. It is therefore marginally irrelevant as long as

|Cǫǫǫ| < 2.

(5.12)

It would be nice to know if there are CFTs in which this bound is violated. This should be

possible to answer with numerical bootstrap techniques. In the 2d Ising model, Cǫǫǫ = 0

as a result of the duality between high and low temperatures. Therefore, disorder is

marginally irrelevant. We will discuss this in much more detail soon. For some early work

on the disordered d = 2 model, see [25].

Let us now denote

δ ≡ d − 2∆ǫ

(5.13)

and imagine that δ is parametrically small (i.e. the heat capacity is parametrically small).
As in (3.27), we add to the beta function a linear piece in c2:

= −δc2 + Sd−1(cid:18)2 −

C2

ǫǫǫ(cid:19) c4 + O(c6).

(5.14)

As long as (5.12) holds and 0 < δ ≪ 1, this leads to a weakly-coupled, disordered, ﬁxed
point at long distances with

Sd−1c2

(5.15)

Indeed, if δ ≪ 1, the higher order corrections are suppressed.

We now calculate the heat-capacity exponent of this infrared disordered theory. This

is done by calculating the infrared dimension of ǫ in the disordered theory. In the replica

20

trick, this corresponds to calculating the infrared dimension of E(x) = 1√nPA ǫA(x). Using

(3.37), the dimension in the deformed theory is given by

∆IR
E = ∆ǫ − Sd−1CEEOg∗ + . . .

(5.16)

where in the last line we set n = 0 and used (5.15). We immediately see that, to this

order, the dimension of the energy operator in the infrared is always bigger than in the

ultraviolet.

The disordered heat-capacity exponent in the infrared (at leading order in δ) is

αIR = −

C2

ǫǫǫδ

2d − (d − ∆ǫ)C2

(5.17)

Since this formula is only to be trusted at leading order in δ = d − 2∆ǫ, we can simplify
the denominator and get

αIR = −

C2
ǫǫǫδ
d(2 − 1

ǫǫǫ)

+ . . . .

(5.18)

Note an interesting fact: As long as the OPE coeﬃcient Cǫǫǫ satisﬁes (5.12), the infrared
heat capacity exponent satisﬁes αIR ≤ 0. As reviewed in the introduction, this property
of disordered ﬁxed points is expected on general grounds.

Let us also consider the magnetic susceptibility exponent γIR. This is determined by

the dimension of the spin operator σ(x) in the disordered theory, or correspondingly the

operator S(x) = 1√nPA σA(x) in the replica theory. Since the three-point coeﬃcient CSSO

vanishes (5.9), the one-loop correction to the anomalous dimension of the spin operator

vanishes as well.

Recalling that γ = d−2∆σ

An interesting consequence of these results is that as long as (5.12) is upheld, we have that
γIR > γUV to leading order. As we will mention again in the section that follows, this is

consistent with experimental results.

subtracted the divergence coming from the OPE coeﬃcient COOO. This integral is still
divergent because of the OPE coeﬃcient COOE but this can be subtracted as well according
to the prescription of footnote 5 which we utilize below.

The four-point function in (5.20) can be expressed in terms of the connected four-point

Z ddxhS(0)O(e1)O(x)S(∞)ic,

can be obtained.

6. The Random-Bond Ising Model with d = 2 + ε

We begin with the observation that for small ε the pure and disordered ﬁxed points

are parametrically close. Indeed, using [3] we can compute the dimension of the energy

operator in the pure theory to ﬁrst order

∆ǫ = 1 + 0.3ε + O(ε2).

And therefore the heat capacity exponent

α ≡

D − 2∆ǫ
D − ∆ǫ ∼ 0.4ε + O(ε2).

(6.1)

(6.2)

This is positive for ε > 0 and therefore disorder is slightly relevant for small, positive, ε.

We can thus try to compute various properties of the disordered theory in the infrared.

Because of the general result (5.17), we ﬁnd that the infrared heat capacity exponent

vanishes to leading order in ε. This is because Cǫǫǫ = 0 in d = 2 due to the high-low
temperature duality in the Ising model. Therefore, we get for the disordered heat capacity

exponent

αIR(ε) ∼ ε2.

(6.3)

In other words, the leading order in ε prediction for the heat capacity exponent in the

disordered theory is that the heat capacity exponent vanishes. This is similar to the
degeneracy of the perturbation in q − 2 in [17]. This degeneracy in the ﬁrst order in ε has
already appeared in section 8 of [16].

It would be nice to compute the coeﬃcient of ε2. Clearly the sign of this contribution

is crucial. For that we need to consider ﬁrst the disordered beta function in d = 2 to two

loops. Using section 3, we ﬁnd a result in agreement with [17]:

dc2

d log µ

= −2π(n − 2)c4 + (n − 2)(2π)2c6 + . . .

dλ

d log µ

= −λ(cid:18)1 + 2π(n − 1)c2 −

1
2

(n − 1)(2π)2c4(cid:19) + . . .

(6.4)

(6.5)

where λ corresponds to the coupling that generates correlation functions of the energy

operator.

The one-loop terms are precisely consistent with our (5.10) and (5.14). The vanishing

of the beta function for n = 2 is due to the fact that the deformation ǫ1ǫ2 is exactly
marginal in this case (it is a c = 1 model, called the Ashkin-Teller model).

24

Now let us imagine studying the theory at d = 2+ε with very small ε. We have proven

above that to ﬁrst order in ε the heat capacity in the disordered ﬁxed point vanishes. To go

to 2nd order in ε we need to know the corrections of order ε to the one-loop beta functions

and we need to know the two-loop beta functions. For the two-loop beta functions we can
use the d = 2 Ising values. The error in doing that is of the order of ε3.

So it remains to discuss the corrections in ε to the one-loop beta function. The one

loop coeﬃcient in (6.4) has in general a term C2

ǫǫǫ, see (5.10). Cǫǫǫ = 0 in the 2d Ising
model. If we assume that Cǫǫǫ starts at order ε then we can therefore neglect this in our
computation since this correction is formally of the order of a three-loop contribution.

Hence, our beta functions take the form

dc2

d log µ

= −(d − 2∆ǫ)c2 − 2π(n − 2)c4 + (n − 2)(2π)2c6 + . . .
(n − 1)(2π)2c4(cid:19) + . . .

And hence the infrared dimension of the energy operator is

(6.8)

(6.9)

We can trust this formula to order ε2 so we plug in the expression d−2∆ǫ = 2+ε−2−0.6ε =
0.4ε. Hence we ﬁnd to order ε2

∆IR

ǫ = 1 +

1
2

ε + 0.02ε2 + . . . .

(6.11)

The sign of the second order correction is correct (positive), and it leads to a negative heat

capacity exponent which takes the following form in the expansion in ε:

αIR =

d − 2∆ǫ
d − ∆ǫ ∼ −0.04ε2 + . . . .

25

(6.12)

Upon plugging ε = 1 we get αIR = −0.04, which is well within the range of experimental
and Monte Carlo results as summarized in [26]!

We ﬁnish by considering the dimension of the spin ﬁeld σ to the ﬁrst nontrivial order

in the epsilon expansion. As before, let us ﬁrst consider the anomalous dimension of the

spin ﬁeld in d = 2 as a function of the marginal disorder coupling, c. If we deform the

action by the spin ﬁeld with coeﬃcient M , then we will ﬁnd that the beta function of M

is given by

dM

d log µ

= −M(cid:18) 15

8

+ O(c6)(cid:19) .

(6.13)

The ﬁrst nontrivial contribution arises only at third order in conformal perturbation theory!

The vanishing of the ﬁrst order in perturbation theory is obvious from the fact that σ and

ǫ are orthogonal operators. This has been already explained above (5.19).

The vanishing of the second order in conformal perturbation theory is less obvious.

The term of order c4 is given by D in (5.28). In the 2d Ising model, we have

G(z, z) = hσ(0)ǫ(z)ǫ(1)σ(∞)ic = |1 + z|2

4|z||1 − z|2 −

1

|1 − z|2 .

(6.14)

Plugging this into (5.28), we have checked numerically that the resulting integral vanishes.

It would be nice to understand why this happens. Vanishing of the two-loop contribution
also follows from the analysis of [27], which can be used to extract the c6 term in the
anomalous dimension of σ.

We now need to discuss how (6.13) is modiﬁed in 2 + ε dimensions. The ﬁrst order in

conformal perturbation theory vanishes for all ε due to (5.26) but the second order may
not. Hence, the second order may in general take the form ∼ εc4, which in our Wilson-
Fisher-like ﬁxed point would be comparable with c6. Therefore, we cannot compute this
correction without additional work, but we can already conclude that

∆IR
σ (ε) − ∆σ(ε) = O(ε3).

(6.15)

Thus we can use (6.15) to give the expansion in ε for γIR/γUV containing the ﬁrst

two nontrivial orders in ε. Indeed,

γIR
γUV =

(d − 2∆IR
(d − ∆IR

σ )(d − ∆ǫ)
ǫ )(d − 2∆σ)

.

Therefore, if we neglect corrections of order ε3, we ﬁnd:

γIR
γUV =

.

d − ∆ǫ
d − ∆IR
26

ǫ

(6.16)

(6.17)

This is generally a positive number because ∆IR
ǫ

increases in the infrared relative to ∆ǫ.
If we just use (6.17) directly in d = 3 we ﬁnd that the ratio is γIR/γUV = 1.59/1.48 ∼
1.075− 1.08 while the experimentally measured ratio is around 1.09, so the agreement with
experiment is rather good.

7. An Uncontrolled Computation in d = 3

In the 3d Ising model, the energy operator has dimension ∆ǫ ∼ 1.41, which is rather
close to the Harris bound d/2 = 1.5. One could therefore attempt to compute observables
in a perturbative expansion in δ = d − 2∆ǫ ≈ 0.18. Note that in the 3d Ising model, there
is no nearly marginal operator in the OPE of the energy operator with itself. Indeed, the
next Z2-even operator has dimension ∼ 3.84 [28]. (We give a more precise estimate of this
dimension below.) Therefore, the formalism of the previous section applies.

Of course a perturbative expansion in 0.18 is not rigorously justiﬁed, but given the

observations above, it might be a reasonable approximation. (In the next section we explain

how this can be turned into a rigorous expansion.) The idea behind this approximation is

summarized in Fig 2: Since δ in the Ising model is numerically small, and because there

is no operator of the type ǫ2(x), the disordered Ising ﬁxed point may be viewed as being

close in the RG sense to the pure nontrivial ﬁxed point.

27

It is also interesting that we can perform this purely 3d analysis at all. To apply

conformal perturbation theory to the 3d Ising model, we take dimensions and OPE coeﬃ-
cients from the conformal bootstrap. These results will enable determinations of ∆IR
∆IR

σ (and the corresponding critical exponents) at one and two loops, respectively.

ǫ and

7.1. One Loop

To evaluate αIR using (5.18), we need ∆ǫ and the OPE coeﬃcient Cǫǫǫ in the 3d Ising

model. Using the techniques of [29,30] we ﬁnd8 9

∆ǫ = 1.412625(10),

Cǫǫǫ = 1.532435(19).

(7.1)

More detail on the computation of ∆ǫ and Cǫǫǫ will be reported in [33]. Substituting these

values into (5.18) gives

αIR ≈ −0.166 + O(δ2).

(7.2)

Measurements of the heat capacity in the disordered Ising model yield results around
αIR = −0.05 (see [26] and references therein) and αIR = −0.1 (see [1] and references
therein). We do not quote errors on these numbers since there seems to be a signiﬁcant

spread of results in the literature. The theoretical result (7.2) is somewhat larger in

magnitude than the experimental results, though roughly of the same order (and with the

correct sign).

It is interesting to turn the logic around and use the experimental measurements of

disordered exponents as a way of estimating Cǫǫǫ in the pure theory. The quoted values of
αIR roughly correspond to

Cǫǫǫ ∼ 1.2 − 1.35.

(7.3)

This is a fairly satisfying result for a leading order approximation! Similarly, we can

use (5.19) to obtain another estimate of Cǫǫǫ. The results quoted in the literature are
around γIR = 1.34. In the pure theory we have γUV = 1.23. This leads to an estimate

8 In reference [31] the value Cǫǫǫ = 1.45± 0.30 is obtained. In [32] the value Cǫǫǫ = 1.32± 0.15

is reported.

9 Note that in the d = 2 Ising model, Cǫǫǫ = 0 by the Kramers-Wannier duality. In d = 4,
Mean Field Theory is valid and we get (4.1) Cǫǫǫ = 2√2. The average of these two values is in
the right ballpark for Cǫǫǫ in d = 3.

28

around Cǫǫǫ = 1.2 which is again both satisfactory as a leading-order approximation and
consistent with the estimate from the critical exponent αIR.

It would be interesting to extend the analysis of this section also to correlators of the

stress tensor. For comments about the stress tensor in disordered theories, see [34,35]. One
can readily verify that the ﬁrst correction due to disorder is at least of the order O(c4),
i.e. it is quadratic in the heat-capacity exponent. This suggests the diﬀerence between the

pure and disordered two-point function of the stress tensor will be numerically small in

the 3d Ising model.

7.2. Two Loops

The anomalous dimension of the spin operator

S(x) =

1

√nXA

σA(x).

(7.4)

vanishes at one loop, due to vanishing of the OPE coeﬃcient CSSO. According to the
discussion in subsection 3.4, the two-loop anomalous dimension γS,2 is then scheme-
independent (up to three-loop corrections). We can compute it by considering the in-
tegrated four-point function hSOOSi in the replicated theory. This can in turn be written
in terms of hσǫǫσi in the pure theory,

hS(x1)O(x2)O(x3)S(x4)i =

We will approximate the four-point function and gσǫǫσ(u, v) using the conformal block
expansion, truncated at some large value ∆∗ of the dimension of the exchanged operator.
We have already written the integral (3.39) in such a way that the conformal cross ratio z

is restricted to the region

R = {z : |z| ≤ 1 and |z| ≤ |1 − z|}.

(7.7)

The error from truncating the conformal block expansion at ∆∗ falls exponentially as
|ρ(z)|∆∗, where [36,37]

(7.9)

where the maximum value of |ρ(z)| is achieved at z = 1
In practice, the OPE
coeﬃcients in the Ising model are such that ∆∗ = 6 already gives a good approximation
for the integrals we need, to one part in 10−3.

Thus, to estimate our four-point functions in the region R, we need the OPE coeﬃ-
cients and dimensions of low-lying operators.10 The numerical bootstrap [39] has taught

us that crossing symmetry and unitarity severely constrain these quantities. The usual
procedure is to study N derivatives of the crossing equations around the point z = z = 1
2 .
These N equations, together with unitarity, then determine ∆σ, ∆ǫ and the OPE coeﬃ-
cients Cσσǫ, Cǫǫǫ to high precision [28,40,29,30,33].

We will need information about a few more operators in the conformal block expansion.

To set rigorous bounds on k operator dimensions requires a k-dimensional scan, which

quickly becomes infeasible as k grows. So to estimate the low lying spectrum, we adopt

the non-rigorous approach of [41,40]. For each N , we compute a set of dimensions and OPE

coeﬃcients that solve N derivatives of crossing equations. As N grows, some dimensions

and OPE coeﬃcients for low-lying operators begin to converge, giving an estimate for their

values in the 3d Ising CFT.

To obtain a unique set of dimensions and OPE coeﬃcients for each N , we can ex-

tremize some quantity [42,41]. As we vary the parameters of the extremization problem

(for example, the values of ∆σ or ∆ǫ, the quantity to be extremized, or the number of
derivatives N ), some operator dimensions remain stable, while others jump around. The
“stable” operators have relatively low dimension and large coeﬃcients in the σ × σ, σ × ǫ
and ǫ×ǫ OPEs. Presumably, the stable operators are actually present in the 3d Ising CFT,
while the jumping operators come from the arbitrariness of the extremization procedure

and disappear at the true Ising point, as discussed in [40]. Fortunately for us, the oper-

ators with low dimension and large OPE coeﬃcients are exactly the ones that are most

important for our calculation.

10 When the quantity to be integrated is a linear function of Ising four-point functions, then it
is possible to obtain direct bounds on the integral without computing the operators that appear

in the four-point function [38]. An advantage of this approach is that we obtain precise error bars

on the result. Here, we take the more straightforward route of approximating the entire function

gσǫǫσ(u, v) ﬁrst and then integrating.

30

We guess the “stable” operators by computing a few example spectra and comparing

them. To compute a spectrum we set up a semideﬁnite program (SDP) using the techniques

of [43,44,29], and then solve it using SDPB [30]. The spectrum and OPE coeﬃcients can

be extracted from a combination of the primal and dual solutions of the SDP. More detail

on this process will be reported elsewhere. Our example spectra are computed by ﬁxing

∆σ, ∆ǫ, and θ ≡ arctan(Cǫǫǫ/Cσσǫ) to some values in the allowed region [33] and then
maximizing Cǫǫǫ. Speciﬁcally, we take

(∆σ, ∆ǫ, θ) ∈ {(0.51814834, 1.4126195, 0.96925883), (0.51814861, 1.4126207, 0.96925745),

ℓ=2 is a lower bound on the dimension of Z2-even spin-2 operators, other than the

ℓ=2 > 3, we additionally impose the Ward identity CσσT /CǫǫT =

∆σ/∆ǫ. As in [29,30,33], we also impose that σ, ǫ are the only relevant scalars. The number

of derivatives of the crossing equation used is Λ = 35, in the notation of [30]. The choices

in (7.10) are somewhat arbitrary. It would be interesting to do a more systematic scan

over the full allowed region in [33].

The result (7.15) is in agreement with experimental results based on the critical exponent γ,

0.550(25) [1], but slightly in tension with results for the ratio β/ν in experiment, 0.507(15)

[1], and Monte Carlo, 0.505(23) [26].

Although the results are scheme dependent,

it is nonetheless interesting to apply
formulae from minimal subtraction to compute β2, γE,2 in the 3d Ising CFT. Plugging the
expressions for hOOOOi and hEOOEi in appendix B into (3.31), (3.39), and using the
conformal block expansion, we obtain

The two-loop correction is numerically large — perhaps unsurprising since it is contami-

nated with lower-loop quantities due to our inability to give a scheme-independent deﬁni-

tion. However, it is interesting to note that the two loop correction has the right sign to

push the one-loop result (7.2) closer to experimental determinations.

8. Discussion

We have given two novel ways to understand the random-bond Ising model. The ﬁrst

is a controlled expansion in d = 2 + ε spacetime dimensions. This has the advantage of

being systematically extendable up to arbitrary loop level. At each loop level, we need more

information about the continuation of Wilson-Fisher critical exponents in ε. It would be

extremely interesting to develop the (2 + ε)-expansion directly around the 2d Ising model.

33

(It is understood how to do this for the O(N ) models with N > 2 [45], but, as far as we

know, for the 2d Ising model it is still not known whether this can be done.)

The second method is an uncontrolled expansion in 3−2∆ǫ ≈ 0.18 in the 3d Ising CFT.
With this approach, we can leverage precise conformal bootstrap calculations of 3d Ising

CFT data. However, we cannot perform a controlled expansion to higher orders within

perturbation theory. Nevertheless, the results are encouraging, giving good agreement
with experimental determinations of both ∆dis

and ∆dis
σ .

Both of these methods have signiﬁcant advantages over the √

ǫ

eǫ-expansion around 4

dimensions. For example, both give the correct sign for the disordered head-capacity at
leading order, whereas the √

There is a third, controlled, method that we have not yet explored in detail. It is

∼ 1.51 and therefore the random bond disorder is only very
slightly marginally irrelevant. Logarithmic corrections to the heat capacity would therefore

2d Ising model with random bonds.

If we now imagine that we can study the O(N ) models with continuous N , we see
that for some Nc ∈ (1, 2) (with Nc very close to 2 from below) the random bond disorder
becomes genuinely marginal. One can have a controlled expansion in N−Nc and eventually
try to study the N = 1 model in this way.

It is interesting to consider whether the disordered Ising model can be bootstrapped

directly. Firstly, one can ask whether the disordered theory has conformal symmetry. This

would follow if the deformed n-copy Ising model were conformally-symmetric for each n (as

long as the analytic continuation to n = 0 does not destroy the conformal Ward identities)
and if the limit n → 0 commutes with the infrared limit [24].

34

The 2 + ε expansion shows that conformal symmetry holds perturbatively in ε, and

we suspect it is likely to hold nonperturbatively. Another question is whether the theory

is reﬂection positive. Because it is obtained by analytic continuation in n, there is no
particular reason to expect reﬂection positivity.12 On the other hand, the exclusion plot in
[29] does not immediately apply to the dimensions (∆IR
E ), since the disordered theory

has the additional relevant operatorPA6=B σAσB which can appear in the S × S OPE.13

Perhaps the severe truncation method [48], which does not rely on reﬂection positivity,

S , ∆IR

could shed light on the disordered theory.

Finally, the methods developed here could be used in a variety of other situations.

For example, it is curious that a random boundary magnetic ﬁeld in the d = 2 Ising model

is marginal. It turns out that it is marginally irrelevant [49,50]. This can be used as a

starting point for various interesting calculations in conformal perturbation theory that we

plan to consider in the future. Another example is the random symmetric rank-two tensor

anisotropy in the XY model that one can attempt to study with our methods. In d = 3

this kind of disorder is relevant and it presumably drives the system to a new ﬁxed point.

This is in contrast with the isotropic random-bond disorder in the d = 3 XY model, (8.1),

which is slightly irrelevant.

An outstanding open problem is that of disorder in quantum systems. In that case one

is instructed to consider a time-independent random source. The replica trick allows to

convert this into a non-local-in-time interaction which may be formally relevant, marginal,

or irrelevant. The renormalisation of such non-local Hamiltonians should be studied with

care. One could hope that a systematic conformal perturbation theory can be developed.

Appendix A. Double Trace Deformations of Generalized Free Fields

Consider the following toy example. We assume there exists a generalized free ﬁeld,
Ψ2. We normalize Ψ such that
Ψ2 has a unit-normalized two-point

Ψ, of dimension d/2 and we deform the CFT by fR 1√2
Ψ(x)Ψ(0) ∼ 1
xd + . . .. Therefore, the operator O ≡ 1√2
function. The OPE coeﬃcient COOO is given by

O(x)O(0) ∼

2√2
xd O(0) =⇒ COOO = 2√2.

The connected four-point function is

F (z) = hO(0)O(x)O(e1)O(∞)ic = 4(cid:18)

(x − e1)d(cid:19) .
In this theory, the beta function is one-loop exact. It is given by βf = −√2f 2.

The integrated connected four-point function is thus as in (3.16),

(A.4)

The main point is that we know that in any physical scheme (A.3) does not produce a

single log because the beta function is one-loop exact. Therefore we can subtract this term

to cancel all the double logs in (3.16). We therefore ﬁnd (3.18).

It is also interesting to consider the anomalous dimension of Ψ. In this computation

one encounters the four-point function as in (3.34)

hΨ(0)O(e1)O(x)Ψ(∞)ic = 2(cid:18)

1

xd(x − e1)d +

1

(x − e1)d(cid:19) .

We know that the dimension of Ψ is one-loop exact 14 and therefore A′ = 0 in (3.37). This
implies that there is no single-log in the integral

ρ Z ddz(cid:18)
Z dρ

(z − 1)d(cid:19) .

zd(z − 1)d +
Therefore we can subtract an appropriate combination of (A.3) and (A.5) in order to
remove the log2 divergences from (3.35) as in (3.38).
14 We easily see that CΨΨO = √2 and hence ∆Ψ(f ) = ∆Ψ − √2f .

Appendix C. Regulated Integration Over R

In our two-loop calculations in the minimal subtraction scheme, we must integrate

over the region

R = {x ∈ R3 : |x| ≤ 1, |x| ≤ |e1 − x|}.

(C.1)

The integral should be regulated in such a way that we throw away power law divergences
coming from integrating |x|−a with a > d = 3 at the origin. Furthermore, when terms
|x|−d+δ lead to large contributions ∼ 1
δ , we must compute the integral with high-enough
precision to subtract oﬀ the poles. Our strategy will be to expand the integrand as a sum

of terms so that the integral can be performed exactly for each term. The accuracy of the

result will depend on the number of terms we keep.

Our integrands are most naturally expressed as a series in r, where each term is a

polynomial in η = cos θ, with

reiθ =

z

(1 + √1 − z)2

.

(C.2)

If we truncate the series at order O(rk), the resulting error will go like (2 − √3)k, where
2 − √3 is the maximum value of r over R. Thus, it suﬃces to integrate individual terms

in the expansion,
