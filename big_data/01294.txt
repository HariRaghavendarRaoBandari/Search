Toward a Quantum Theory of Tachyon Fields

Charles Schwartz∗

Department of Physics, University of California

Berkeley, California 94720

Abstract

We construct momentum space expansions for the wave functions
that solve the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for tachyons, recog-
nizing that the mass shell for such ﬁelds is very diﬀerent from what
we are used to for ordinary (slower than light) particles. We ﬁnd that
we can postulate commutation or anticommutation rules for the op-
erators that lead to physically sensible results: causality, for tachyon
ﬁelds, means that there is no connection between spacetime points
separated by a timelike interval. Calculating the conserved charge
and 4-momentum for these ﬁelds allows us to interpret the number
operators for particles and antiparticles in a consistent manner; and
we see that helicity plays a critical role for the spinor ﬁeld. Some
questions about Lorentz invariance are addressed and some remain
unresolved; and we show how to handle the group representation for
tachyon spinors.

Introduction

What of old habits do we keep and what do we change? That is always the
challenging question for theoretical physicists who are seeking to innovate.
The idea of tachyons (faster than light particles) has been a fascination of
some theorists for many decades [1]; but few professional colleagues nowadays
grant that idea much credibility.

Among the many objections have been the claims of negative energy
states, anti-causal behavior, and other bizarrities. My own earlier papers
have shown that if we work with a conserved energy-momentum tensor, we
can resolve questions about negative energy states [2]; and a more recent
study showed how quantum wave packet considerations eliminated the main
complaints about causality violation.[3] That same paper showed the possibly
important contributions of (classical) tachyons to cosmological studies.

When it comes to quantizing tachyons, especially quantizing a tachyonic
ﬁeld theory, the prevalent view [4] is that there is really nothing that propa-
gates faster than light but it is just some unstable state that needs to decay;
and everything conforms to ordinary concepts of causality.

This paper takes just the opposite approach: assume that tachyons might
exist as a particle/ﬁeld system that always propagates faster than light. This
poses several mathematical challenges, and here we show how to manage most
of that. Sections 2 and 3 review basic ideas about the mass shell and solu-
tions of the Klein-Gordon equation. Sections 4 and 5 look at solutions of
the Dirac equation, for ordinary particles and for tachyons; and we note the
suggestion of a critical role for helicity in making a distinction between parti-
cles and antiparticles. Section 6 discusses orthogonality among various plane
wave states for both equations for both types of particles. In Sections 7 and
8 we investigate models of second quantization that may lead to causal com-
mutators or anti-commutators. Causality for ordinary (slow) particles means
that there is no connection between points separated by a spacelike interval
in spacetime, while for tachyons it means just the opposite. In Section 9 we
identify number operators for particles and antiparticles; and in Section 10
we look at Lorentz invariance of our results and raise some further questions.
Section 11 shows how we can handle the group representation problem for
a tachyon spinor; and in Section 12 we summarize what has been achieved
here and look forward to further work.

2 Why canonical quantization is wrong here.

The mathematical procedures known as ”canonical quantization” have built
into them certain mathematical biases that come from assumed physical
behavior of ordinary (slower than light) particles and ﬁelds. I believe that
some of this is shown, or at least implied, in my 1982 paper; but let me go
into this here in some detail. We start with ﬁelds deﬁned in 4-dimensional
spacetime and we want to ask about how they propagate.

For ordinary particles/ﬁelds we assume that some initial solution is con-
tained in some ﬁnite volume of 3-space at an initial time t0 and it will also
be contained in a ﬁnite volume at another time t some ﬁnite distance away.
This assumption makes sense for any particle/ﬁeld that can travel no faster
than the speed of light; but it is not acceptable for a tachyon, which might
travel at arbitrarily high speeds.

For a tachyon ﬁeld, we look for an alternative geometric arrangement
about its propagation that makes sense with the physical understanding that
we mean to describe a particle/ﬁeld that can never propagate slower than
the speed of light. We choose some 2-dimensional surface in 3-dimensional
coordinate space, over all values of the time t. Our initial value assumption
is that the particle (wave packet) will pass through this surface in some ﬁnite
time interval; and we can be sure that it will also pass through any other
parallel surface, located a ﬁnite distance away, in a ﬁnite time interval.

Note that this alternative scheme could not be used for a slower-than-
light particle/ﬁeld because there is the possibility for the particle to be at
rest, thus it may never pass through the second surface.

(Question: Are we free to use either scheme for light?)
This leaves us with the question, for the tachyon ﬁeld, whether this chosen
surface in 3-space is an open surface or a closed surface. In most of this paper
we use an open surface (z= const.); but in the Appendix we chose a closed
surface (r=const). I must admit that I do not have a general answer to this
question.

3 Basic issues

First we review some basic properties of solutions of the free Klein- Gordon
equations for ordinary particles and for tachyons. They will have the space-

2

time behavior in the form of plane waves.

ψ(x, t) = e−ipµxµ = eip·x−iEt,

where, for ordinary particles,

pµpµ = E2 − p · p = E2 − p2 = +m2.

(3.1)

(3.2)

This equation, describes the “mass-shell” and we see that it consists of a
two-sheeted hyperboloid: one with E ≥ m and the other with E ≤ −m.
Under any proper Lorentz transformation, these positive energy and neg-
ative energy states will remain as two distinct sets of solutions. Later, they
will be used to describe particles and anti-particles.

However, when we consider tachyons the mass shell is diﬀerent:

pµpµ = E2 − p · p = E2 − p2 = −m2,

(3.3)

and this is just a single surface - a hyperboloid of one sheet - in four dimen-
sional space. Positive and negative values of E are not separated.

We now introduce spin.

4 Dirac wavefunction for an ordinary particle

For the Dirac equation, we have the familiar free-particle solutions,

ψ(x) = e−ipµxµuh(E, p),

uh(E, p) = N   (E + m)|p, h >

hp|p, h >

!

(4.1)

where |p, h > is a 2-component eigenfunction of the spin in the direction of
p with eigenvalue h = ±1.
With a choice of the normalization constant, N = 1/q2|E + m|, we
calculate the conserved four-current for this wavefunction as,

jµ = ¯ψ γµ ψ = sign(E)(E, p),

(4.2)
where ¯ψ = ψ†γ0. We similarly calculate the components of the conserved
Energy-Momentum tensor 1 as,

T 00 = sign(E)E2,

T µν = (i/4)[ ¯ψ γµ

↔
∂ν ψ + ¯ψγν
T 03 = T 30 = sign(E)Ep,

↔
∂µ ψ],

→

↔
∂ =

(4.3)
T 33 = sign(E)p2, (4.4)

∂ −

←
∂

1Some authors have diﬀerent ways of writing this tensor for the Dirac wavefunction.

This form is simple and manifestly real and symmetric.

3

where we assume that the momentum is in the 3-direction; and all other
components of the tensor vanish.

In both of those calculations we see that the factor sign(E) may cause
some confusion, until we introduce annihilation and creation operators, which
anti-commute with one another, and let us have positive counts of particle
or antiparticle number as well as energy.

5 Dirac wavefunction for a Tachyon

We can start by replacing the mass m in the Dirac equation by an imaginary
im; and we do the same with the plane wave solutions (4.1). We also need a
diﬀerent deﬁnition for the adjoint wavefunction,

¯ψ = ψ†γ0 γ5,

(5.1)

where γ5 is the unit Hermitian matrix that anticommutes with all the γµ.
Then, with the normalization constant N = 1/√2p, we calculate:

jµ = −h(E, p),
(5.2)
Here is the strong suggestion that the helicity of the tachyon wavefunction

T 03 = T 30 = −hEp,

T 00 = −hE2,

T 33 = −hp2.

can serve to distinguish between particle and anti-particle

6 Orthogonalities

Next we want to consider the general superposition of plane waves, for scalar
and spinor wavefunctions.

This will require us to use an orthogonality property that is derived from
a conserved current. Let me show this by deﬁning a generalized conserved
current density that involves any two solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation.

jµ
1,2(x) = iψ∗

1(x)

↔
∂µ ψ2(x) = iψ∗

1(x) [

→

∂µ −

←
∂µ]ψ2(x); ∂µjµ

1,2(x) = 0.

(6.1)

Integrating this local conservation law over a 3-dimensional volume that con-
tains all of the solutions, we have

d

dt Z d3x j0

1,2(x, t) = 0.

4

(6.2)

Let me take two plane wave solutions and put them into this integral. The
integral over d3x requires that the two 3-momenta, p1, p2 be equal. Then
we have only two possibilities : either E1 = E2 or E1 = −E2. But, if it
↔
is the second case, then the operator
∂t gives us a zero result. This is the
orthogonality of positive and negative energy solutions of the Klein-Gordon
equation.

That is easy for ordinary particles. What about tachyons? We need to
reconsider how we choose a three-dimensional surface over which to inte-
grate ∂µ jµ
1,2(x) = 0. We can choose an integral over all time and over a
two-dimensional space such that all of the tachyonic matter in those wave-
functions will pass through that surface over time. The integral over all time
reqires that the two energies be equal. Suppose that the spacial surface is
z = 0: then the integral over x and y will require that px = p′
x and py = p′
y.
z. But we see that jz invlves
This leaves us with the two possibilities pz = ±p′
↔
the operator
∂z; and this will provide us with the complete orthogonality
result.

Now we look at the Dirac equation. Plane wave solutions will lead us
to the same mass-shell picture; but the orthogonality relation comes about
diﬀerently. For ordinary particles we are looking at j0 = ψ†
1ψ2. Looking at
the spinors shown in (4.1) we see that they are orthogonal if p1 = p2 and
h1 = h2 but E1 = −E2.
Finally we turn to the Dirac tachyons. The space-time integrals give us,
as they did with the Klein-Gordon wavefunctions, the possibility of pz = −p′
z.
We are then looking at jz = ψ†
1 σzψ2. If h1 = −h2, we get orthogonality from
the inner product of the Dirac spinors (4.1):

(6.3)
If we have h1 = h2, then we have to look at the 2-component spinors |p,h >.
Here is the relevant theorem.

(E + im)∗(E + im) + h1h2p2 = 0.

< p, h|σ · (p − p′)|p′, h >=< |2pzσz| >= (h − h)p < | >= 0,

and that completes the orthogonality proof for jz.

7 Causal Commutators for Ordinary Fields

For a complex scalar ﬁeld we have the Klein-Gordon wave equation,

[∂2
t − ∇2 + m2]φ(x) = 0;

5

(7.1)

and this leads to the general expansion,

φ(x) = Z

d3k

qω(2π)3 Xǫ

eiǫ(k·x−ωt) aǫ(k),

ω = √k2 + m2,

ǫ = ±1.

(7.2)
The expansion coeﬃcients aǫ(k) are operators that obey some exchange (com-
mutator or anticommutator) relations,

[aǫ(k) , a†

ǫ′(k′)]± = δ3(k − k′) δǫ,ǫ′ ?.

(7.3)

The unknown quantity ? is dimensionless. If we choose to use the anticom-
mutator (plus sign on the brackets), then ? must be positive, for example
+1. If we choose the commutator (minus sign on the brackets), then ? could
be of any sign, for example ? = ǫ is a posible choice.

Now we calculate the bracket of the ﬁeld and its conjugate at two diﬀerent

space-time points.

[φ(x), φ†(x′)]± = Z

d3k

ω(2π)3 Xǫ

If we choose ? = +1, then this integral and sum reduces to

sin(ω(t − t′))

ω

.

(7.6)

This second expresion is causal: the integral vanishes if r > |t − t′|. This
important result may be seen as follows. First extend the k-integral to −∞,
since the integrand is an even function of k. Then note that the integrand
is an analytic function of ω2; thus it is an analytic function of k; and we can
separate cos(kr) = (eikr + e−ikr)/2 and move each contour integral into the
far upper or lower half-plane. If r > |t − t′|, then we get zero.
it will not give this causal result.

The previous integral, from ? = +1, is not an even function of ω and thus

Next, we follow the same line of analysis for the ordinary Dirac equation.

where |k, h > is an eigenfunction of the 2-component Pauli spin matrix dotted
into the direction of the momentum vector k, with eigenvalue (helicity) h =
±1.

We postulate exchange relations for the expansion coeﬃcients (operators),

[bǫ,h(k) , b†

ǫ′,h′(k′)]± = δ3(k − k′) δǫ,ǫ′ δh,h′ ?,

(7.10)

and go on to caculate the commutator or anti-commutator of the ﬁelds,

(7.11)

(7.12)

(7.13)

where we have introduced the adjoint Dirac diﬀerential operator ˜D. The
product D ˜D is equal to the Klein-Gordon operator.

This last expression is causal, just like the one earlier for a scalar ﬁeld
using ? = ǫ. However, if we had chosen ? = ǫ here , our result for the
commutator of the Dirac ﬁelds would not be causal. One may consider this
discussion a (weak and incomplete) proof of the familiar connection between
spin and statistics.

Now we carry out the same study for tachyon ﬁelds.

8 Causal Commutators for Tachyon Fields

In the Klein-Gordon diﬀerential equation we change m2 to −m2 and in the
Dirac equation we change m to im. We also know that the mass shell is quite
diﬀerent and so our expansion of the wavefunctions uses somewhat diﬀerent
variables.

For the complex scalar tachyon,

φ(x) = Z ∞

−∞

dω

√k
(2π)3/2 Z d2ˆk ei(kˆk·x−ωt) a(ω, ˆk),

k = +√ω2 + m2,

(8.1)
where the three-vector k is now decomposed into its magnitude k and its
direction ˆk. We postulate the exchange relations,

[a(ω, ˆk), a†(ω′, ˆk′)]± = δ(ω − ω′) δ2(ˆk − ˆk′) ?,

and this is written so that the as yet unknown ? is dimensionless.

Now the exchange relation for the ﬁelds is,

[φ(x), φ†(x′)]± = Z ∞

−∞

dω

(2π)3 e−iω(t−t′) Z d2ˆk eikˆk·(x−x′) k ?.

If we try ? = 1, the result is,

Z ∞

−∞

dω e−iω(t−t′)

4π

sin(kr)

(2π)3

r

.

(8.2)

(8.3)

(8.4)

This is not causal in any sense.

An alternative choice is ? = η · ˆk, where η is a vector orthogonal to some
chosen surface that is a reference plane for our quantization eﬀorts. This
concept was introduced in my earlier (1982) paper on tachyon particles and
ﬁelds. If we revert to ordinary (slower then light) ﬁelds, then the 4-vector η
could be taken as (1, 0, 0, 0); and the term η · ˆk is equivalent to the factor ǫ
used in the previous section. For tachyons, we might take η = (0, 0, 0, 1) or
another oriented spacelike 4-vector.

Setting ? = η · ˆk, we ﬁnd for the scalar tachyon ﬁelds,

[φ(x), φ†(x′)]− = −i

4π

(2π)3 η · ∇ Z ∞

−∞

dω e−iω(t−t′) sin(kr)

.

(8.5)

This is causal for tachyons. This integral will vanish if |t − t′| > r.

8

In my earlier paper I postulated the scalar ﬁeld commutator to have the
factor ? = η · k/|η · k|, which is diﬀerent from what I have used here. That
may also lead to a formally causal result but the result found above is much
nicer.

Now, we turn to the Dirac tachyon ﬁeld.

ψ(x) = Z ∞

−∞

dω

√2(2π)3/2

e−iωt Z d2ˆk eikˆk·x Xh   ω + im

Then,

[bh(ω, ˆk), b†

h′(ω′, ˆk′)]± = δ(ω − ω′) δ2(ˆk − ˆk′) δh,h′ ?.

(8.6)

(8.7)

For ? = 1, we ﬁnd

[ψ(x), ψ†(x′)]+ =

1

2(2π)3

˜D γ5 (σ · ∇/i) Z ∞

−∞

dω e−iω(t−t′) Z d2ˆk eikˆk·(x−x′) ,

(8.8)
and this integral gives the nice tachyon causal result seen above for the
scalar ﬁeld. So it looks like we can use the anticommutation rules for Dirac
tachyons.

In Appendix A we look at this work in spherical coordinates.

Interpreting the number operators

Combining the formulas from the several previous sections, we calculate
charge and 4-momentum for the ﬁelds in various cases.

For ordinary scalar ﬁelds,

Q = Z d3x j0 = Z d3kXǫ

a†
ǫ(k) aǫ(k) ǫ.

(9.1)

For ǫ = +1, we interpret each a† a as a number operator for particles, with
a annihilating the vacuum state |0 >; and for ǫ = −1, we interchange the
order of operators and take a† as the annihilation operator for antiparticles.
The minus sign between these two number operators says that particle and
antiparticle have opposite charge. And we learn to ignore the inﬁnite constant
left over from the commutator. This is all standard business.

9

For ordinary Dirac ﬁelds, we get this result for the charge,

Q = Z d3x j0 = Z d3k Xǫ,h

b†
ǫ,h(k) bǫ,h(k);

(9.2)

and this for the energy-momentum,

P ν = Z d3x T 0,ν = Z d3kXǫ,h

ǫ b†

ǫ,h(k) bǫ,h(k)(ω, k).

(9.3)

Using the anticommutation rule for changing the order of b and b† for ǫ = −1,
gives us opposite sign of the charge for particles and antiparticles; this also
gives us positive energy for each particle and also for each antiparticle. Again,
zero point charge and energy are thrown away.

Now we look at the tachyons. First, for the scalar ﬁeld,

Qη = Z dt d2x⊥ η · j = Z ∞

∞

dω Z d2ˆk η · ˆk a†(ω, ˆk) a(ω, ˆk);

(9.4)

and for the Dirac tachyon ﬁeld,

Qη = Z ∞

∞

dω Z d2ˆk η · ˆk Xh

h b†

h(ω, ˆk) bh(ω, ˆk).

(9.5)

We look for interpretation of a number operator, like a†a, which will be
read as the number of particles ﬂowing through the surface with normal
η.
(Carefully stated, this is the number of particles per unit interval of
frequency/energy per unit of solid angle in direction of momentum.) For the
scalar ﬁeld, this is just a positive operator. For the Dirac ﬁeld, we see the
factor h appears and so we anti-commute the operators b and b† for h = −1
and then we have positive operators with b† identiﬁed as the destruction
operator for the antiparticle. This is what we had anticipated in Section 4.

Finally, we look at the energy-momentum.

∞

h b†

h(ω, ˆk) bh(ω, ˆk) (ω, k).

P ν

dω Z d2ˆk η · ˆk Xh

η = Z dtd2x⊥ ηµT µ,ν = Z ∞
(9.6)
this appears to give a similarly decent interpretation. If we look at η · P , this
becomes a positive quantity - after that rearrangement of the b’s for h=-1 -
for both particles and antiparticles. This is analogous to the positiveness of
P 0 for ordinary particles.

10

10 Lorentz invariance

Let’s look at a couple of “causal” integrals found in the previous section.

where ω = √k2 + m2 in the ﬁrst integral and k = √ω2 + m2 in the second
integral. The expressions on the right-hand side of these equations depend
on Lorentz-invariant forms involving the space-time coordinate intervals.

= π J0(mS),

Next, some may question whether the use of the reference surface, repre-
sented by the 4-vector η, violates Lorentz invariance. Formally, any change
of coordinate systems should change that vector as well; therefore such forms
as η · ∂ are invariant. Also, it is worth noting that the “canonical” rules for
quantizing an ordinary ﬁeld theory involve a particular choice of a reference
plane, usually t = 0, in which one introduces operators.

The most challenging question about Lorentz invariance of the theory
presented here has to do with the identiﬁcation of helicity as marking the
distinction between particles and antiparticles for the Tachyon Dirac ﬁeld
theory. Is this a Lorentz invariant identiﬁcation? It is common to consider
the following covariant 4-vector,

Sµ =

i
2

ǫµνκλ pν γκ γλ = (σ · p, ip × α − Eσ).

(10.3)

If we take the expectation value of this operator in one of the plane-wave
states described earlier we ﬁnd,

< Sµ >=< 1 > (hp, −hE ˆp);

(10.4)

and it is tempting to say that this expression is a timelike 4-vector (for
tachyons with p2 − E2 = +m2) and therefore the sign of the time component
will not change under a Lorentz transformation. However, if we just start
with a given eigenfunction of helicity and apply a general Lorentz transfor-
mation, then some states of the opposite helicity will appear. Is this a fatal
ﬂaw of the theory? I am unsure. One might consider that the ”conserva-
tion of helicity” is a principle applicable to any free-particle tachyon state,

11

as somewhat analogous to the conservation of electric charge for ordinary
particles. Perhaps this should be regarded as an unresolved question about
what physical properties such particles, if they exist, might have.

In earlier work [3] it was pointed out that the distinction between “ab-
sorption” and “creation” of a tachyon was not a Lorentz invariant concept -
although it is so for ordinary (slower then light) particles. Perhaps a similar
argument applies to the disinction beteen particle and antiparticle (absent
such a conserved quantity like electric charge). Such considerations appear in
familiar theoretical studies [5] of neutrinos in the Majorana representation.
In the limit of Dirac theory with zero mass, that is to say looking at the
Weyl 2-component equation, helicity is a Lorentz invariant. So, one might
predict, if the above theory is accepted, that there may be mixing of particle
and antiparticle in the quantitative amount of order m/p. How might one
detect such a phenomenon, for example, if neutrinos were tachyons, with
mass less than 1 eV?

11 Dealing with der Gruppenpest

There is a familiar line for dismissing tachyons in quantum theory that goes
like this: ”The Little Group for tachyons is O(2,1) and this has no unitary
representations aside from the one-dimensional.”

Let’s examine this problem. The group theory approach for ﬁnding irre-
ducible representations of the Lorentz group (initiated by Wigner many years
ago) starts by identifying a subgroup of Lorentz transformations - called the
Little Group - that leave unchanged the four-momentum of a single particle
state as seen in some particular frame of reference. For a normal (slower
than light) particle this is the rest frame (3-momentum equal to zero) and
the Little Group is O(3), any rotation in 3-space.

For a tachyon, the selected frame of reference sees the particle with energy
equal zero and momentum oriented in some direction, call it the z-axis. That
4-vector is invariant under the following transformations: rotation about the
z-axis and boost in the x-y plane. This Little Group is generated by the
three operators Jz, Kx, Ky which obey the following Lie algebra,

[Jz, Kx] = iKy,

[Ky, Jz] = iKx,

[Kx, Ky] = −iJz,

(11.1)

and it is the minus sign in that last commutator that says this is the group
O(2,1) and not O(3). The invariant form is J 2
y . Now we can easily

z − K 2

x − K 2

12

write down a 2-dimensional complex representation of this Lie algebra, as
follows,

i

Jz =

σ3, Kx =

σ2,

(11.2)

using the standard Pauli spin matrices. We note that two of those operators
are not Hermitian; so, when we form a general operator for the Lie Group,

U = eiαJz+iβKx+iγKy ,

(11.3)

where α, β, γ are arbitrary real parameters, this is not a unitary matrix.

We note the following identity, involving the Hermitian adjoint and the

inverse of this matrix U.

U † = σ3 U −1 σ3.

(11.4)

This leads us to construct a new rule for inner products in the space of
this representation, one that uses σ3 as a metric and leads to the following

Is there any harm caused by introducing a metric into the Hilbert space
of a quantum theory? There may be objections in general but let us see what
is actually involved in the particular situation being studied here, namely,
the state of a single free particle that happens to be a tachyon with spin.
This operator σ3 has eigenvalues ±1; and we recognize this as being exactly
the helicity described in our earlier study of the Dirac equation for a tachyon.
(Remember that the z-direction is the direction of the particle’s momentum
in the selected frame of reference.)

So, here is where we stand. We can handle the Little Group for spin
1/2 tachyons if we use the helicity operator as a metric in the Hilbert space
for a single particle or a single antiparticle. This leads us back to the pre-
vious discussion about helicity being the quantity that deﬁnes particles vs
antiparticles among solutions of the Dirac equation for tachyons.

(I wonder what would happen if we introduced a similar nontrivial metric
- say ǫ, the sign of the energy - in the group theory analysis for ordinary
particles. When we looked at the conserved 4-current for ordinary solutions
of either the Klein-Gordon or the Dirac equations we found such a plus-or-
minus sign in the inner product that is identiﬁed as the charge.)

12 Conclusion and Prospectus

We have achieved substantial success in formulating a consistent quantum
theory for free tachyon ﬁelds. This was achieved by starting with a partic-
ular basis in momentum space, (ω, ˆk), and then selecting commutation or
anticommutation rules that led to explicit tachyon causality.

What physical interpretation do we give to the conserved current density?
For ordinary particles, scalar or spinor, we use jµ(x) to couple to the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld; and so Q = R d3x j0 is identiﬁed with the electric charge

of the particle. In the quantized expressions Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2) we see that
this has one sign for the particle and the opposite sign for the antiparticle.
This is familiar for ordinary particles. What about the tachyons ﬁelds that
we have now quantized? Looking at Eq. (9.5) for the Dirac tachyon, we see
the same sign for Qη for both the particle and the antiparticle. This suggests
that this ﬁeld does not couple to the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
It will be, of
course, a matter of experimental fact whether such a spinor tachyon system
carries electric charge - if such a thing actually exists; but the mathematical
work we present here does make this suggestion. Thus neutrinos, which carry
no net electric charge, are an enticing candidate for tachyonicity.

Earlier theoretical studies of a possible charged tachyon had quite a time
making sense out of Cherenkov radiation that would be expected from such
a particle. If the neutrino is seriously considered as a candidate, one might
ask whether there is some internal charge structure that might lead to such
radiation eﬀects. A recent paper [6] provides some formulas that can be used
to estimate this eﬀect; and, if one assumes a mass around 1 eV for a tachyon
neutrino, it is small in the extreme, even over cosmic time. Another paper
[7] provides a calculation of the gravitational Cherenkov radiation from such
a tachyon and, again, ﬁnds that it is small in the extreme even over cosmic
times.

The KATRIN (KArlsruhe TRitium Neutrino) experiment, now in progress,
will be very relevant to the question of whether the neutrino may be a
tachyon.

What remains to be studied on the theoretical side? Introduce interac-
tions with other ﬁelds; formulate an appropriate extension of the S-matrix;
see how tachyons might be incorporated into the Standard Model of elemen-
tary particles.

Appendix A: Scalar tachyon ﬁeld quantized on a sphere

Let’s try the expansion of a complex scalar ﬁeld for tachyons in terms of

familiar functions for spherical geometry.

φ(x) = Z dωe−iωtXl,m

Ylm(ˆx) [al,m(ω)h(1)

l (kr) + b†

l,m(ω)h(2)

l (kr)],

(A.1)

[al,m(ω), a†

l′,m′(ω′)] = [bl,m(ω), b†

(A.2)
where all other commutators vanish and k = √ω2 + m2. We have separated
the terms representing outgoing waves, h(1)
l ∼ eikr/kr, from incoming waves
h(2)
l = h(1) ∗

l′,m′(ω′)] = ckδ(ω − ω′)δl,l′δm,m′,

.

l

We calculate the commutator of the ﬁeld operators and get:

[φ(x), φ†(x′)] = Z dωe−iω(t−t′) Xl,m
l (kr′) − h(2)

l (kr)h(2)

ck[h(1)

l (kr)h(1)

l (kr′)].

Ylm(ˆx) Y ∗

lm(ˆx′)

(A.3)

If we take the derivative with respect to r′ and then set r′ = r, we get the
analog of the usual equal time commutator of conjugate ﬁelds.

[φ(r, ˆx, t),

∂
∂r

φ†(r, ˆx′, t′)] = −iδ(t − t′) δ2(ˆx − ˆx′)/r2,

(A.4)

with the choice c = 1/(4π).

Moreover, one can show that the general commutator Eq. (A.4) will van-
ish if |t − t′| > |r − r′|, which seems to be an overstatement of the idea that
tachyons always travel faster than light. However, if we look at large r and r′
(very large compared to 1/m), then we might substitute the asymptotic val-
ues for the spherical Hankel functions in that equation and get the following
formula.

[φ(r, ˆx, t), φ†(r′, ˆx′, t′)] ≈ i δ2(ˆx − ˆx′))Z ∞

−∞

dω e−iω(t−t′) sink(r − r′)

2πkrr′

.

(A.5)

This shows an unexpected result that the general commutator vanishes unless
ˆx = ˆx′; and in that context this tachyonic “causal” restriction makes better
sense.

15

There appears to be some delicate math here and we can suspect that
working under the inﬁnite sum over l we have made some careless assump-
tions about convergence.

Consider, for example, this Green’s function for the tachyonic Klein- Gor-

don equation.

G0(x, x′) = Z ∞

−∞

dω e−iω(t−t′) coskR

R

,

R = |x − x′|.

(A.6)

This will vanish if |t−t′| > R, as one sees using arguments given in Section 7.
However, when this is expanded in spherical functions, analogous to (A.4),
the relevant functions are k jl(kr<) nl(kr>), and this would lead us to the
wrong limit: each term in the sum over l vanishes if |t − t′| > |r + r′|.
In summary, we have seen that expanding the ﬁeld in spherical functions
gives a less-than-perfect result for causality of the tachyon ﬁeld operators;
however, we did ﬁnd a perfect analog for the ”equal-time” commutation rule.
By contrast, the earlier work, in Section 8, gave a perfect causal result for the
tachyon ﬁeld operators; but that did not give us the analog of ”equal-time”
commutators.
