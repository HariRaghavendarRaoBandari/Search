The inelastic collapse of stochastic trajectories of a randomly accelerated particle moving in half-
space z > 0 has been discovered by McKean and then independently re-discovered by Cornell et.
al. The essence of this phenomenon is that particle arrives to a wall at z = 0 with zero velocity
after an inﬁnite number of inelastic collisions if the restitution coeﬃcient β of particle velocity is

smaller than the critical value βc = exp(−π/√3). We demonstrate that inelastic collapse takes place

also in a wide class of models with spatially inhomogeneous random force and, what is more, that
the critical value βc is universal. That class includes an important case of inertial particles in wall-
bounded random ﬂows. To establish how the inelastic collapse inﬂuence the particle distribution, we
construct an exact equilibrium probability density function ρ(z, v) for particle position and velocity.
The equilibrium distribution exists only at β < βc and indicates that inelastic collapse does not
necessarily mean the near-wall localization.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The models of a randomly accelerated particles which
collide inelastically with a wall arise naturally in diﬀerent
contexts ranging from driven granular matter to dynam-
ics of conﬁned polymers (see e.g.
[1] and relevant refer-
ences therein). In the simplest one-dimensional model,
a particle is subjected to Gaussian white noise and in-
stantaneously loses a certain part of its velocity at the
moments of reﬂection from the wall. The ﬁrst rigor-
ous results for this problem go back to McKean [2], who
discovered that trajectory tends to touch the origin of
phase space (particle velocity turns zero on the wall) if
the restitution coeﬃcient of particle velocity is smaller
that some critical value. Subsequently, this phenomenon
was named the inelastic collapse and has been extensively
studied in physics [3–9] and mathematics [10, 11] litera-
ture. In particular, it has been established that inelastic
collapse does not necessarily force the particle to remain
at the wall forever [8–11].

More recently there has been signiﬁcant interest in spe-
ciﬁc generalization of the aforementioned classical model,
which includes viscous damping together with inhomo-
geneous noise whose intensity increases with distance to
the wall. First of all, the inhomogeneous generalization is
relevant to the single-particle dynamics in turbulent en-
vironment. Say, for an inertial particle in wall-bounded
turbulence, the intensity of noise term, which is propor-
tional to the ﬂuctuating velocity of the carrier ﬂuid, van-
ishes at the wall due to no-slip boundary condition. An-
other ﬂuid-dynamical application of the model with inho-
mogeneous random force describes the relative motion of
inertial particles in turbulent ﬂows. Surprisingly, it was
found that the critical restitution coeﬃcient, correspond-
ing to the inelastic collapse in the classical homogeneous
model, controls also the localization-delocalization tran-

sition for the inertial particle in viscous sublayer of wall-
bounded turbulence [15] and path-coalescence transition
in relative motion of particles with very large inertia [14].
These ﬁndings have motivated us to consider here the
behaviour of a particle which is accelerated by a random
force with arbitrary intensity proﬁle. We demonstrate
that some results, which was previously derived within
homogeneous model, are valid also for more general sit-
uation. In particular, phenomenon of inelastic collapse
turns out to be universal, although the time needed for
collapse can be either ﬁnite or inﬁnite depending on the
speciﬁc form of inhomogeneity. Moreover, we construct
an exact equilibrium probability distribution for particle
velocity and coordinate which is a zero-ﬂux solution of
the Fokker-Planck equation with inhomogeneous temper-
ature. That distribution corresponds to the non-trapping
boundary condition at the origin of phase space, i.e. the
particle that ﬁnds itself on the wall with zero velocity
does not stay there for later times. The main focus of the
present work is on the localization properties of the par-
ticle in the non-trapping case: does it remain in vicinity
of the wall or escape to inﬁnity? As explained below, the
answer depends on the elasticity of particle-wall collision
and on the spatial proﬁle of noise intensity. The anal-
ysis includes the classical problem with a homogeneous
noise as a particular case. At the end, we discuss how the
presence of viscous damping aﬀect the main conclusions
of our analysis.

II. MODEL FORMULATION

Consider the motion of a particle in one-dimensional
domain z ≥ 0 under an inﬂuence of random force with
spatially inhomogeneous intensity. The particle coordi-
nate and velocity evolve in time accordingly to the fol-

lowing equations

dz
dt

= v,

dv
dt

= ξ,

(1)

in which the Gaussian noise ξ is delta-correlated in time
with a zero mean and the pair correlation function

hξ(z, t1)ξ(z, t2)i = 2κ(z)δ(t1 − t2).

(2)

The noise magnitude κ(z) can be interpreted as a non-
uniform temperature or turbulence intensity. While
many of the results presented here are valid for quite ar-
bitrary z-dependence of κ, we mainly focus our attention
on power-law model

κ(z) = zm, m ≥ 0,

(3)

where index m can be called the inhomogeneity degree.
The uniform case m = 0 has been intensively discussed in
the context of driven granular matter [1]. The model with
m = 2 describes the motion of a single particle near the
minimum of turbulence intensity [12] and the relative mo-
tion of two close particles in a one-dimensional random
ﬂow [13, 14], both in the limit of high inertia. At m = 4
and m = 1 the proﬁle (3) mimics the space-dependent
turbulent diﬀusivity of wall-bounded turbulent ﬂow in
the viscous sub-layer [15] and in the logarithmic layer
[16], respectively.

The boundary condition at z = 0 is inelastically re-
ﬂecting so that at every bounce the particle loses some
part of its wall-normal velocity

v → −βv,

(4)

where 0 < β < 1.
In general, β can be viewed as an
eﬀective restitution coeﬃcient related to energy dissipa-
tion due to collision-induced plastic deformations and/or
particle-wall hydrodynamic interaction [17]. The realis-
tic models for these dissipation processes should involve
β which is a function of the impact velocity. Besides, the
temporal or spatial irregularities at the surface of the wall
may give rise to randomness of this parameter. In this
study we restrict ourselves to an idealized model with the
constant restitution coeﬃcient β.

of the ﬁrst return velocity for diﬀerent proﬁles (3) of noise
intensity: m = 2 (squares) and m = 4 (circles). Solid line
represents the theoretical prediction (8).

where βc = e−π/√3 ≈ 0.163. The distribution (5) is
sharply peaked around the value n ln(β/βc) giving the
typical collision velocity vn ∼ v0(β/βc)n, which exponen-
tially increases with the number of collisions at β > βc,
and exponentially decreases otherwise. Then for β < βc
particle trajectories undergo inelastic collapse, touching
the origin of the phase space after an inﬁnite number of
collisions with probability 1.

Let us demonstrate that Eq. (5) remains valid in the
case of inhomogeneous forcing. The key ingredient in the
original derivation of this formula by Cornell et. al.
[3]
is the velocity distribution P (v|v0) on the ﬁrst return to
the origin for a particle released from z = 0 with velocity
v0 > 0.
In general, this quantity can be expressed as
P (v|v0) = vρ(0,−v) where the probability density func-
tion ρ(z, v) corresponding to the stochastic equations (1)
is the solution of the boundary value problem:

ρ(0, v) =

INELASTIC COLLAPSE

Solving Eqs. (6) and (7) for κ = 1 one obtains the prob-
ability distribution for the velocity of the ﬁrst return:

In [2] and [3] the typical trajectory of randomly accel-
erated particle moving near an inelastic wall was studied
for the case of homogeneous forcing (m = 0). In partic-
ular, considering the particle leaving the wall at z = 0
with the initial velocity v0 > 0, Cornell et. al. derived
analytically the statistical distribution of the return ve-
locity v right after the nth boundary collision [3]. The
corresponding probability density function of u = ln v/v0
in the large n limit is as follows:

In the case of inhomogeneous tempera-
ture, the new variable χ = R z
0 κ(z′)dz′, turns (6) into
−v∂χρ + ∂2
v ρ = 0, while Eq. (7) remains the same. In
other words, the problem is reduced to that with κ = 1
provided κ(z) is integrable at z → 0. Therefore, the
probability distributions (5) and (8) do not depend on
the speciﬁc form of κ(z).

Universality of the distribution (8) for the diﬀerent
proﬁles of noise intensity is conﬁrmed by the direct nu-
merical simulations of the stochastic equations (1), see
Fig. 1.

Based on Eq. (5), we conclude that for a wide class
of models the particle comes to the wall with zero veloc-
ity after inﬁnite number of collisions as long as β < βc.
The dynamics of the trajectory collapse, however, is non-
universal. Let us estimate how long does the collapse take
for diﬀerent power-law proﬁles (3). Since the typical ve-
locity of particle at nth collision is vn ∼ v0(β/βc)n, then
the particle get this velocity at zn ∼ v3/(m+1)
. This esti-
mate is found by comparison of two terms in the rhs of the
Fokker-Planck equation (6). Therefore, time intervals be-
tween collisions can be estimated as Tn ∼ zn/vn. Next,
we write d˜z/dt ∼ (zn+1 − zn)/Tn ∼ ˜z(m+1)/3 ln(β/βc),
where ˜z(t) is the characteristic particle coordinate. For
m 6= 2 one obtains

Thus, the collapse takes inﬁnitely long at m > 2, and ﬁ-
nite time at m < 2. Note also that in the quadratic case
m = 2 our naive estimate gives ln ˜z(t)/˜z0 ∼ ln(β/βc)t,
i.e. the typical distance from the wall exhibits exponen-
tial behaviour; this result is in agreement with an exact
analysis of quadratic model published before [14].

IV. NEAR-WALL LOCALIZATION

What can we learn about the real-space particle dis-
tribution from the collapse transition in the probability
density (5) of reﬂected velocities? For m = 0, Cornell et.
al.
[3] have argued that the particle remains at rest on
the wall once its trajectory in phase space touches the
origin. This statement has been questioned by many au-
thors on the basis of simulations and theoretical analysis
[7–9]. It has been realized that at β < βc the problem is
indeterminate unless we specify the boundary condition
at the origin of phase space [8, 11]. If the collapsed tra-
jectories are set to terminate (trapping condition), then
the origin plays a role of an absorbing point and particle
localization at z = 0 occurs indeed. However, if these
trajectories are not set to terminate (non-trapping con-
dition), after collapse the particle is sent back into the
domain z > 0 with unit probability. Thus, for m = 0,
depending on the boundary condition at the origin one
may obtain either collapsing or non-collapsing solution
at β < βc.

An open problem in the model m = 0 (which we solve
below) is whether the non-collapsing solution is localized
in a vicinity of the wall or the particle eventually escapes
to inﬁnity. In general, it is clear that the possibility of lo-
calization for the non-trapping boundary condition must
depend on the proﬁle of noise intensity — if it turns into
zero at z → 0 fast enough, one may expect the particle

3

to stay near the wall. To address localization for arbi-
trary proﬁle of noise intensity we consider the equilibrium
probability density function ρ(z, v) which is the solution
of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation

− v∂zρ + κ(z)∂2

v ρ = 0,

(10)

supplemented by the inelastic boundary condition

ρ(0, v) = β−2ρ(0,−v/β)

for v > 0,

(11)

which ensures that the outcoming ﬂux of probability ρvdv
for positive v coincides with the incoming ﬂux for −v/β.
Near-wall localization means that the equilibrium real-
space probability distribution n(z) = R +∞
ρ(z, v)dv is
normalizable at z → ∞.
In [15] the boundary value problem (10-11) has been
solved for κ(z) = z4. Here we extend that approach to
construct ρ for arbitrary temperature proﬁle κ(z) which
is only assumed to be integrable at z → 0. Let us intro-
duce a self-similar substitution

−∞

ρ = χ(z)−ah(ζ),

(12)

where

ζ =

v3

9χ(z)

, χ(z) =

z

κ(z′)dz′,

(13)

and a is some scaling index.
Inserting (12) into (10),
it is easy to see that unknown function h satisﬁes the
conﬂuent hypergeometric equation

ζ∂2

ζ h + (2/3 + ζ) ∂ζh + ah = 0,

(14)

whose solutions are the Kummer function M (a, 2/3,−ζ)
and the Tricomi function U (a, 2/3,−ζ). Since the func-
tion M (a, 2/3,−ζ) diverges exponentially at large nega-
tive ζ, one should choose h = U (a, 2/3,−ζ) at ζ < 0.
At positive ζ the function h is a linear combination of
M (a, 2/3,−ζ) and U (a, 2/3,−ζ). Equating the values of
the function h and of its derivative over v at ζ = +0 and
ζ = −0, one obtains
h(ζ > 0) =

Next, exploiting the asymptotic behavior of M and U

at large values of |ζ|, we ﬁnd
h(ζ → +∞) ≈

in which v > 0. Comparing this relation with the bound-
ary condition (11) we obtain the equation

sin(πa) − sin[π(a − 2/3)]

sin(2π/3)

= β3(a−2/3),

(18)

that determines the scaling index a as a function of elas-
ticity coeﬃcient β.

The equation (18) has a solution a = 2/3 at any β,
that gives the probability density function having sym-
metric tails ρ(z, v) ∝ v−2 for v → ±∞. However, this
stationary distribution requires a particle source at the
wall since it has a positive probability ﬂux R dv vρ. In-

deed, multiplying the equation (14) by ζ−1/3, integrating
over ζ and assuming that h tends to zero fast enough at

choice a = 2/3 corresponds to nonzero ﬂux. The zero-
ﬂux solution of Eq. (18) starts from a = 5/6 at β = 0,

ζ → ±∞, we obtain (a − 2/3)R dv vρ = 0. Thus, the
then a decreases as β grows. At β → βc = e−π/√3 one

obtains a = 2/3. When β grows further, exceeding βc,
that branch gives a < 2/3.
In this case the tails of ρ
at v → ±∞ decay slower than v−2 an condition of zero
ﬂux R dv vρ = 0 cannot be satisﬁed. We thus conclude
that the equilibrium probability distribution exists only
for the values of β below the threshold of the inelastic
collapse.

The stationary probability density for the position of
the particle is n(z) = R +∞
ρ(z, v)dv ∝ χ(z)−a+1/3, where
(18) and
the scaling index a(β) is determined by Eq.
varies from 5/6 to 2/3 for 0 ≤ β ≤ βc. For the power-law
temperature proﬁle (3) we obtain

−∞

n(z) ∝

1

z(m+1)(a−1/3) .

(19)

The particle is localized if this distribution is normalis-
able at inﬁnity. Figure 2 represents the phase diagram of
the localization-delocalization transition in β − m plane.

4

Since 2/3 < a ≤ 5/6, distribution (19) is integrable at
z → ∞ for any m ≥ 2. Therefore, for m ≥ 2 the parti-
cle is localized near the wall at β < βc, and delocalized
otherwise. Next, for 1 < m < 2 the distribution (19) is
localized provided β < ˜βc(m), where the critical value ˜βc
is determined by the condition (m + 1)(a( ˜βc)− 1/3) = 1.
Finally, if 0 ≤ m ≤ 1, the spatial density (19) decays at
z → ∞ too slowly and the particle is delocalized even in
the limit of totally inelastic collisions, β → 0 (a = 5/6).
Thus, the region of localization coincides with the re-
gion of inelastic collapse only if the noise inhomogeneity
is strong enough, namely, for m ≥ 2. At 0 ≤ m < 2 one
may obtain a situation when trajectories undergo inelas-
tic collapse, but the particle is nevertheless delocalized.
It is important to remind here that for 0 ≤ m < 2 the
collapse takes a ﬁnite time. It was proved previously for
the particular case of homogeneous noise m = 0 that
after collapse the particle leaves the wall with unit prob-
ability provided the boundary condition in the origin of
phase space is non-trapping (see [11] and relevant refer-
ences therein). The existence of extended (non-collapsed)
equilibrium probability distribution at β < βc indicates
that escape from the wall is possible also for 0 < m < 2
despite the fact that the intensity of the random force
vanishes at z = 0. Then, the delocalization may occur
even at β < βc due to long-distance excursions between
collapse events.

V. VISCOUS DUMPING

Finally, let us examine how the presence of viscous
damping change the localization properties of a randomly
accelerated particle. Now the equations of motion is

dz

τ

= −

+ ξ,

(20)

where τ is the velocity relaxation time. The Fokker-
Planck equation is as follows

− v∂zρ +

τ

∂v(vρ) + κ(z)∂2

v ρ = 0,

(21)

As previously, we should impose the boundary condition
(11) to take into account the inelastic collisions at the
wall.

Particle is localized if there exist an equilibrium prob-
ability distribution ρ(z, v), and the corresponding real-
space probability density n(z) is normalisable at z → ∞.
While we have not been able to construct an exact so-
lution of the boundary-value problem consisting of Eqs.
(21) and (11, the large-z tail of n(z) can be easily found.
The equilibrium state (if any) is characterized by a
balance between the velocity ﬂuctuations imposed on the
particle by the random force and the dissipation of those
ﬂuctuations due to viscous friction and inelastic colli-
sions. To measure the role of temperature inhomogeneity

given distance from the wall, we introduce the following
dimensionless parameter

I(z) =

τ

˜τ (z)

,

(22)

where ˜τ (z) represents the local time scale given by the
time it takes the particle to experience inhomogeneity of
environment. We can estimate ˜τ (z) as the characteristic
scale of inhomogeneity, which is just z in the case of scale-
free proﬁles (3), divided by the typical velocity ˜v(z) of the
particle, i.e. ˜τ (z) = z/˜v(z). Equivalently, parameter I
can be deﬁned as the ratio of the mean free path l(z) ∼
In those regions
˜v(z)τ and the distance to the wall z.
where I(z) ≪ 1, the ﬂuctuation dissipation mechanism
operates locally:
if the velocity distribution at a given
point is perturbed, it will relax to equilibrium via viscous
dumping essentially experiencing the same temperature.
In contrast, when I(z) ≫ 1, the statistics of particle
velocity is far from local equilibrium with noise since the
particle can reach the wall for the time which is much
smaller than velocity relaxation time τ . In this case the
velocity ﬂuctuations are balanced mainly by dissipative
wall collisions.

Let us assume that condition I(z) ≪ 1 is valid. Then
the typical velocity ˜v(z) is determined by the interplay
of the second and the third terms in the rhs of Eq. (21):

˜v(z) ∼ pκ(z)/τ . Using this estimate we obtain the fol-

lowing z-dependence for the parameter (22)

5

A.

0 ≤ m < 2

If 0 ≤ m < 2, then I(z) → 0 at z → ∞. By other
words, the typical free path of the particle at z → ∞
is much smaller than distance to the wall. Therefore,
the approximation of local equilibrium is justiﬁed: the
statistics of particle velocity at large distance from the
wall is determined by the local temperature of noise. Per-
forming adiabatic elimination of velocity in Eq. (21) one
obtains the following gradient transport equation [12, 18]

∂tn = τ 2∂2

z [κn],

(24)

which describes evolution of the real-space probability
distribution n(z, t) on timescales t ≫ γ−1 and at large z.
It is straightforward to ﬁnd the equilibrium solution of
this equation for κ given by (3):

n(z) ∝

1
zm .

(25)

If 1 < m < 2, then the equilibrium solution is normal-
isable at inﬁnity and, thus, the particle is localized. For
0 ≤ m ≤ 1, the solution decays too slowly and the par-
ticle is delocalized. Note that localization properties are
β-independent since at z → ∞ the particle becomes in-
sensitive to the boundary conditions at the wall.

B. m > 2

For m > 2, we have I(z) → ∞ at z → ∞. The parti-
cle placed at arbitrary large distance from the wall can
reach the wall in ballistic manner and for this reason the
local equilibrium is strongly violated. It can be shown
that the viscous dumping is asymptotically negligible at
z → ∞: the region of phase space where the second term
in the rhs of Eq. (21) is important becomes very nar-
row (along v-axis) in comparison with the body of the
velocity distribution (see [15] for more details). There-
fore, to describe approximately the probability distribu-
tion ρ(z, v) at large distances from the wall we can pass
to Eq.
(10). Moreover, the approximate solution can
be drawn to z → 0 (that corresponds to ballistic ﬂights
of the particle to the wall and back) and, thus, it must
satisfy the boundary condition (11). All this means that
the asymptotic behavior of n(z) at large z is given by Eq.
(19). We conclude that the presence of viscous damping
does not change the phase diagram for m > 2: the par-
ticle is localized if β < βc, and is delocalized otherwise.

C. m = 2

I(z) ∝ zm/2−1.

(23)

One needs to consider separately three diﬀerent cases:
0 ≤ m < 2, m > 2 and m = 2.

In the marginal case m = 2, parameter I becomes z-
independent and can be interpreted as a measure of par-
ticle inertia [14]. If I → 0, then the locally-equilibrium
approach gives the proﬁle n(z) ∝ 1/z2, which is nor-
the particle is localized for
malisable at z → ∞, i.e.

any β.
In the opposite limit I → ∞, the zero-friction
approximation is justiﬁed and one obtains localization-
delocalization transition at β = βc as it follows from
the results of the previous section.
It is possible also
to describe the localization properties for any value of
the parameter I. For this aim we should ﬁnd the sign
of the Lyapunov exponent which is deﬁned as λ =
t−1hln z(t)/z(0)i. The negative Lyapunov expo-
limt→∞
nent corresponds to localization: the particle coordinate
exponentially decreases with time. In contrast, the posi-
tive sign of the Lyapunov exponent means delocalization
because the particle coordinate exponentially grows. Ex-
act calculation of λ allows to determine the phase curve
of the localization-delocalization transition in β− I plane
(see Fig. 2 in [14]). Note that the particle is localized for
any I when β < βc. Figure 3 summarizes the results of
this section.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have studied the one-dimensional dynamics of
a randomly accelerated particle colliding with inelastic
boundary at z = 0. In our model the eﬀective tempera-
ture κ of noise may depend on the spatial coordinate z;
the main focus is on the power-law temperature proﬁles
κ = zm, where m ≥ 0, motivated by the ﬂuid-mechanical
applications. A surprising result of our study is universal-
ity of the collapse transition which was previously known
only for the particular case m = 0: at β > βc = e−π/√3
the typical velocity at the moment of nth collision expo-
nentially grows with n → ∞, but for β < βc the collision
velocity exponentially decreases. Thus, if the velocity
restitution coeﬃcient is small enough, then the particle
ﬁnds itself on the wall with zero velocity after an inﬁnite
number of inelastic collisions. This conclusion is valid for
any z-dependence of κ provided it is integrable at z → 0.
For κ = zm with 0 ≤ m < 2, the collapse occurs in a
ﬁnite time.
Another important result of this paper is the exact
equilibrium solution ρ(z, v) of the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion with non-uniform temperature, which has the uni-
versal self-similar form (12). Note, the solution exists

only if β < βc, i.e. the equilibrium state is possible only
below the collapse threshold. On the other hand, the so-
lution is extended in space indicating that in those cases
when inﬁnite number of collisions occurs for a ﬁnite time
the particle can leave the wall after the trajectory col-
lapse. Thus, the inelastic collapse does not necessarily
localize the particle at the wall. Furthermore, based on
the normalization properties of the equilibrium proba-
bility distribution (19) of particle coordinate, we have
concluded that inelastic collapse does not guaranty even
the near-wall localization, see Fig. 2. For m ≥ 2, the par-
ticle indeed becomes localized in vicinity of the boundary
as the restitution coeﬃcient β is getting smaller than βc.
However, if 1 < m < 2, then the particle is localized only
at β < ˜βc(m), where 0 < ˜βc < βc. Finally, in the models
with 0 ≤ m ≤ 1 one obtains delocalization for any β.
We have also analyzed how the viscous dumping mod-
iﬁes the phase diagram of the localization-delocalization
transition, see Fig. 3. Whether or not the particle is
localized does not depends on the presence of viscous
friction when 0 ≤ m ≤ 1 or m > 2. For 1 < m < 2,
however, the friction leads to localization at any value of
the restitution coeﬃcient β. In marginal case m = 2, the
particle is always localized if β < βc, while for β > βc the
answer depends on the dimensionless parameter I which
measures the particle inertia.

The results summarized above raise several questions
for the future studies. Here we have focused on the non-
collapsing solution implying that after collapse the par-
ticle does not remain at rest at the wall and re-enter the
region z > 0. However, in practice, the particles can be
trapped in a surface potential well provided its impact
velocity is small enough. This case corresponds to the
trapping boundary condition at the origin phase space,
the particle trajectory should be set to terminate
i.e.
there.
It might be interesting to calculate the rate at
which particles deposit on the wall due to the inelastic
collapse. At the moment, the answer is known only for
the homogeneous model, see [4, 5]. An even more interest
question concerns the higher-dimensional generalization
of the present analysis. Is there a collapse transition for
an ensemble of inelastically colliding particles placed in
turbulent ﬂow in two or three spatial dimensions? That
issue is of great importance for a variety of applications
ranging from cloud physics to planet formation.
