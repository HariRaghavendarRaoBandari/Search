Abstract

We show the direct analogy between the ghost-free non-linear formulation of massive gravity
and the standard σ-models well understood in the literature. This issue explains why there are
two non-trivial family of solutions for the spherically symmetric case inside the non-linear massive
gravity formulations with two free-parameters α and β. In general, the case β < α2 has a single
physical vacuum state. On the other hand, the case β = α2 contains a natural vacuum degeneracy.
This is in perfect analogy with the σ-model for scalar ﬁelds where depending on the values taken
by the parameters of the theory the vacuum can be single or degenerate.

INTRODUCTION

Massive gravity theories reproduce the idea of a massive graviton in order to explain why
gravity becomes weaker at large scales such that the accelerated expansion of the universe
takes place [1]. The most popular approach for massive gravity theories is the de-Rham-
Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) formulation [2]. Not only because it is ghost-free. But also for
being able to reproduce naturally the appropriate value of the Vainshtein radius which in
this theory (in other theories too) is the scale after which the accelerated expansion of the
universe becomes relevant [3]. This scale is in perfect analogy with the one obtained inside
General Relativity (GR) for the Schwarzschild de-Sitter case (S-dS), where the gravitational
attractive eﬀects of gravity and the repulsive eﬀect of the cosmological constant (Λ) cancel
each other [4]. Inside the scenario of massive gravity, some black-hole solutions have been
derived [5, 6]. Among all the proposals, the most generic and the easiest one to analyze
is the one obtained in [5]. What is remarkable about the solution formulated in [5] is that
it condensates two family of solutions in a single one.
In fact, by deﬁning the two free-
parameters of the theory as α and β, the two family of solutions can be classiﬁed in 1).
Type I: Which corresponds to the condition β < α2. 2). Type II: Which corresponds to
the condition β = α2. Initially, it would seem to be a coincidence the existence of precisely
two family of solutions depending on the parameter combination. However, after some deep
analysis, it is possible to demonstrate that there is a perfect correspondence between the
two families and the notions of vacuum. In fact, an alternative classiﬁcation is 1). Type
I: Corresponding to a unique vacuum in a free-falling frame. 2). Type II: Corresponding
to a degenerate vacuum in a free-falling frame [7]. For simplicity, it is possible to impose
the stationary condition. In any case, in general it is always expected that any deviation
with respect to the stationary condition should come from the perturbations of the metric.
If gravity is included, the two type of solutions can be classiﬁed as follows 1). Type I:
The vacuum is uniquely deﬁned by the fundamental scales of the theory and the location
of the observer with respect to the source. 1). Type II: The vacuum is degenerate and
then the fundamental scales of the theory are arbitrary [7, 8]. Similar results were found
inside bigravity formulations in [9] but analyzed from a diﬀerent perspective. The paper
is organized as follows: In Sec. (II), we analyze the standard σ-model for the scalar ﬁeld,
already formulated in the literature. In Sec. (III), we explain the black-hole solutions in
massive gravity and we classify them depending on the relation between the free-parameters
of the theory for free-falling observers. In Sec. (IV), we repeat the black hole classiﬁcation
but this time including gravity locally, such that the fundamental scales of the theory will
appear. Finally, in Sec. (V), we conclude.

containing the two free-parameters λ and µ. Depending on the value taken by µ2 (or the
relation between the two free-parameters), the vacuum is unique or degenerate. Note that
the previous action is invariant under the group of transformations

Here we will represent this transformation schematically M = O(N) in order to represent
the set of orthogonal matrices deﬁned in agreement with eq. (2). The potential is deﬁned
in agreement with

φi → Rijφj.

The potential has a minimum deﬁned in agreement with the condition

Note that if µ2 < 0, the minimum is located at φi = 0. On the other hand, if µ2 > 0, then
the vacuum is degenerate and located at

This minimum is degenerate and then we can select with arbitrariness the direction of the
vacuum ﬁeld conﬁguration. Normally, the vacuum direction is taken such that

Note that the vacuum is invariant under the subgroup H = O(N − 1), which leaves the
selected axis unchanged. The subgroup only exchange massless particles among themselves
[10]. The dimension of the coset space, deﬁned as M/H, provides the number of broken
generators.

with

v = µ/√λ.

III. MASSIVE GRAVITY BLACK-HOLE SOLUTIONS

The spherically symmetric black-hole in dRGT massive gravity, contains two non-trivial
solutions (not conformal to Minkowski) [5]. The action in massive gravity can be expressed
schematically as

S = (Kinetic) − (P otential),

(7)

where the Kinetic term corresponds to the Einstein-Hilbert action after expanding it up to
second order, in other words, it contains second-order derivative terms in the action as follows

√−gR → (∂h)(∂h). The potential is a term containing non-derivative terms interactions in

the action. In gravity, the ﬁeld is the graviton and it is represented by the perturbations
of the metric gµν = gµνback + hµν, with gµνback representing the background solution. The
action in massive gravity is expressed as

S =

where U(g, φ) is equivalent to

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g(R + m2

gU(g, φ)),

U(g, φ) = U2 + α3U3 + α4U4.

(9)

The exact deﬁnitions of Un, can be found in [2, 5]. As can be observed from the deﬁnition
(9), the potential in massive gravity, also contains two free-parameters as it is the case of
the linear σ-model. It is convenient to re-deﬁne the set of parameters in agreement with

α = 1 + α3,

β = 3(α3 + 4α4).

(10)

With this deﬁnition, the Schwarzschild de-Sitter solutions in massive gravity theories, de-
velop the following results:

ds2 = −f (Sr)dT 2

0 (r, t) +

S2

f (Sr)

dr2 + S2r2dΩ2.

(11)

This generic solution can be classiﬁed in agreement with the following cases

1. Type I: β < α2

In a free-falling frame, where we can deﬁne f (Sr) → 1, the vacuum for this case is unique.

This means that the minimal of the potential deﬁned in agreement with

∂V
∂hµν

= 0,

(12)

where V (g, φ) = √−gU(g, φ) is unique. In other words, the solution for the previous equa-

tion is hµνvac = hµν(α2, β) trivially for the free-falling case. Note that this is connected to
the fact that T ′
0(r, t) = 0 under the free-falling condition previously mentioned for this case
in [5, 7, 8]. Once the parameters of the theory are ﬁxed, then the vacuum is automatically
deﬁned. The vacuum deﬁned in this way is invariant under diﬀeomorphism transformations
and as a consequence, the symmetry is not spontaneously broken in this case. Note that the
free-falling condition eliminates the fundamental scales of the theory, namely, the Newtonian
constant (G) and the graviton mass parameter (m).

2. Type II: β = α2

For this second family of solutions, for the free-falling condition, the vacuum is degenerate

in the sense that the solution for the condition (12) is given by

0(r, t)),

hµνvac = hµν(α, T ′

(13)
0(r, t) arbitrary.Note that here we are assuming the stationary condition ˙T0(r, t) = S.
with T ′
However, this condition is not necessary when we consider perturbations. Here we keep it
for simplicity but in general, the vacuum solution as it is formulated in eq. (13), depends on
˙T0(r, t) too. There is no loss of generality in the stationary condition assumption because all
our arguments related to T ′
0(r, t) can be just repeated for the case when there are deviations
with respect to the stationary condition under the general solution T0(r, t) ≈ St + At(r, t),
as far as the conditions At << 1 and ˙At << 1 are satisﬁed [5, 7, 8]. Note that the
vacuum deﬁned in agreement with eq. (13) is degenerate and is not invariant under the
diﬀeomorphism transformations depending explicitly on the St¨uckelberg functions T0(r, t).
This issue can be observed better if we deﬁne the dynamical metric containing all the degrees
of freedom in agreement with the non-linear St¨uckelberg trick [11]

αβ,

(14)

with Y 0(r, t) = T0(r, t) and Y r = Sr as has been demonstrated in [5, 7]. The diﬀeomorphism
transformations are then deﬁned in agreement with

gµν →

∂f α
∂xµ

∂f β
∂xν gαβ(f (x)),

Y µ(x) → f −1(Y (x))µ.

(15)

Note that the vacuum deﬁnition (13) will not be invariant under the set of transformations
in eq. (15) depending explicitly on the St¨uckelberg function Y α(x). In this case then we say
that the symmetry is spontaneously broken. The broken generators correspond to the set
of transformations containing the explicit dependence on T0(r, t). In this sense, the vacuum
is not unique and we say that the symmetry has been spontaneously broken.

IV.

INCLUDING GRAVITY

When gravity is included, we have to select the location of the observer with respect
to the source. In such a case, we can generalize the result such that f (Sr) ≈ 1 − ǫ, with
ǫ containing the fundamental scales of the theory, namely, G and m.
If we select the
location of the observer with respect to the source in agreement with r ∽ (GM/m2)1/3, then
ǫ = (GMmg)2/3 [7, 8]. However, it is not necessary to specify in principle any location. What
is important for the moment is to keep in mind that ǫ contains the fundamental scales of
the theory. Again here we have two type of solutions and they can be divided in agreement
with the relation between the two free-parameters as follows

3. Type I: β < α2

For which the St¨uckelberg function has to satisfy the constraint [5]

(T ′

0(r, t))2 =

S2(1 − f (Sr))

f (Sr)

(cid:18) 1
f (Sr) − 1(cid:19) .

(16)

If we introduce the result f (Sr) ≈ 1− ǫ, then the previous result can be expanded as follows

for ǫ << 1. Or

|T ′
0(r, t)| ≈ S

∞

Xn=1

ǫn,

|T ′
0(r, t)| ≈ −S

∞

Xn=0

ǫn,

(17)

(18)

for ǫ >> 1. Here however we do not consider the case ǫ >> 1 because it would correspond
to the situation where the observer is located inside the event horizon and the coordinates
used for describing the solution become inappropriate. The case ǫ → 1 corresponds to the
event horizon condition. For the situation with ǫ << 1, the vacuum solutions deﬁned in
agreement with eq. (12) become

5

The vacuum is then uniquely deﬁned by the location of the observer with respect to the
source and by the fundamental scales of the theory.

hµνvac = hµν(α, β, ǫ).

(19)

4. Type II: β = α2

For this situation, the constraint (16) is not satisﬁed. In such a case, the function T0(r, t)
is completely arbitrary. The arbitrariness of the function is then reﬂected on the arbitrariness
of the parameter ǫ deﬁned previously. By continuity in the solutions with respect to the
parameters α and β, still we can assume a polynomial expansion in terms of the fundamental
scales of the theory, or equivalently, in terms of ǫ. Then we can deﬁne at the lowest order
[7, 8]

T ′
0(r, t) ∽ ǫ,

(20)

with ǫ arbitrary. Then the arbitrariness of the function T0(r, t) is equivalent to an arbitrari-
ness in the fundamental scales of the theory, contained inside ǫ. This issue might be relevant
at the moment of locating ﬁxed points inside this theory. The following table illustrates the
analogy between the linear σ-model and the non-linear formulation of massive gravity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have demonstrated the analogy between massive gravity theories and
the scalar σ-models. This fact explains why there are two family of black hole solutions
well deﬁned in agreement with [5]. The family for which β < α2, deﬁnes a unique notion of
vacuum, deﬁned in general by the position of the observer with respect to the source. On
the other hand, the family for which β = α2, corresponds to the case of degenerate vacuum,
where the symmetry is spontaneously broken. When gravity appears, the arbitrariness of
the St¨uckelberg function T0(r, t) for this solution is equivalent to the arbitrariness of the
fundamental scales of the theory G and m. From this perspective, the theory of massive
gravity seems to develop a rich structure at the vacuum level. We have to remark that the
ambig¨uity in the notions of vacuum in massive gravity theories is what create an (apparent)
eﬀect of extra-particle creation at large scales inside these theories even if the physics at
the event horizon level never changes with respect to the GR case [12, 13].
