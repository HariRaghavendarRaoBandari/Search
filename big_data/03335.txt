CONCENTRATION OF TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL

SURFACES IN H2 × R

RICARDO SA EARP AND ERIC TOUBIANA

Abstract. We prove a phenomenon of concentration of total curvature for stable
minimal surfaces in the product space H2 × R, where H2 is the hyperbolic plane.
Under some geometric conditions on the asymptotic boundary of an oriented stable
minimal surface immersed in H2 × R, it has inﬁnite total curvature. In particular,
we infer that a minimal graph M in H2 × R whose asymptotic boundary is a graph
over an arc of ∂∞H2 × {0}, diﬀerent from the asymptotic boundary of ∂M , has
inﬁnite total curvature. Consequently, if M is a stable minimal surface immersed
into H2 × R with compact boundary, such that its asymptotic boundary is a graph
over the whole ∂∞H2×{0}, then it has inﬁnite total curvature. We exhibit an example
of a minimal graph such that in a domain whose asymptotic boundary is a vertical
segment the total curvature is ﬁnite, but the total curvature of the graph is inﬁnite,
by the theorem cited before. We also present some simple and peculiar examples of
inﬁnite total curvature minimal surfaces in H2 × R and their asymptotic boundaries.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we prove a phenomenon of concentration of total curvature for stable
minimal surfaces in the product space H2 × R, where H2 is the hyperbolic plane.
We recall that a minimal surface M immersed in H2 × R has ﬁnite intrinsic total

curvature, or simply ﬁnite total curvature, ifRM K dA is ﬁnite, where K is the (intrinsic)

Gaussian curvature of M.
Our main theorem, see Theorem 4.1, ensures that under some geometric conditions on
the asymptotic boundary, an oriented stable minimal surface immersed in H2 × R (but
not necessarily properly immersed) has inﬁnite total curvature. In particular, we prove
that a minimal graph M in H2 × R whose asymptotic boundary is a graph over an
arc of ∂∞H2 × {0}, diﬀerent from the asymptotic boundary of ∂M, has inﬁnite total
curvature.
Consequently, we infer the following corollary of Theorem 4.1: Let M be an oriented
stable minimal surface immersed into H2 × R with compact boundary (e. g. a minimal
graph with compact boundary), such that its asymptotic boundary is a graph over the
whole ∂∞H2 × {0}. Then M has inﬁnite total curvature (Corollary 4.1).

Furthermore, we deduce that if p∞ ∈ ∂∞M, we have |n3(p)| → 1 if p → p∞, p ∈ M,
where n3 is the third coordinate of the unit normal ﬁeld (Corollary 4.2).
In Section 5 we exhibit an example of a minimal graph such that in a domain whose
asymptotic boundary is a vertical segment the total curvature is ﬁnite, but the total
curvature of the graph is inﬁnite by Theorem 4.1.

We also present some simple and peculiar examples of inﬁnite total curvature minimal
surfaces in H2 × R and their asymptotic boundaries.

We would like to point out that in our previous work, we proved a geometric property of
an oriented stable minimal annuli end M with compact boundary, properly immersed
into H2 × R, see [30]. We introduced the notion of asymptotic boundary of M that is
suitable for our studies, as well. We call the set of points of the asymptotic boundary
of M with ﬁnite (vertical) height, the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary (see Deﬁnition 2.2
below). The main result in [30] ensures that if the end M converges to a vertical plane
and the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M is contained in two vertical lines, then M has
ﬁnite total curvature. If the end of M is embedded we showed that it is a horizontal
graph with respect to a horizontal geodesic γ, or simply a horizontal graph. For a
deﬁnition of a horizontal graph, see, for instance, [12]. Loosely speaking in certain
sense the main result in [30] is a counterpart of the main theorem in the present paper.
Summarizing, we proved in [30] the following geometric behavior, up to a compact part
of M:

• Any equidistant curve of γ intersects the end M at most at one point and it

intersects it transversally ([12, Proposition A.3] and [30, Step 7].

• Let n3 be the third coordinate of the unit normal ﬁeld on M with respect to the
product metric on H2 × R. We have that n3(p) → 0 uniformly when p → ∂∞E
[30, Step 3]. Consequently, the tangent plane throughout the end is nowhere
horizontal.

It will be very interesting to investigate a similar result as in [30], for minimal surfaces
immersed into H2 × R with nonempty non compact boundary. In this direction we
set here the following problem: Find geometric conditions on a minimal surface S
immersed into H2 × R, with nonempty non compact boundary, whose ﬁnite asymptotic
boundary is contained in a vertical line to have ﬁnite total curvature. The example
exhibited in Section 5 suggests this problem.

We remark that a horizontal graph with respect a geodesic γ which is transverse to
the intersecting equidistant curves to γ is stable. A vertical graph (see the deﬁnition,
for instance, in [28]), which is transverse to the intersecting vertical geodesics is stable,
as well. This follows from the classical criterion of stability for minimal surfaces: Let
M be an oriented connected minimal surface immersed into H2 × R. If there exists a
positive smooth function u on a bounded domain Ω of M satisfying Lu = 0, where L
is the stability operator [1, Section 2.2], then Ω is stable [3, Lemma 1.36].

We point out now an important property of a complete minimal surface immersed in
H2 × R: The ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of a complete minimal surface in H2 × R
with ﬁnite total curvature is constituted of vertical lines, see [12, Theorem 2.1 and
Proposition 2.4].
Notice ﬁrst that there are many minimal surfaces in H2 × R whose ﬁnite asymptotic
boundary is the union of regular curves, see, for instance, M. Rodriguez and F. Martin
[18] and the authors [26], [27]. However, there are “local obstructions” to a curve
be the asymptotic boundary of a minimal surface in H2 × R, see [28, Theorem 2.1].
Also, B. Coskunuzer gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition on a ﬁnite collection
of Jordan curves in ∂∞H2 × R to be the asymptotic boundary of a complete area
minimizing surface in H2 × R, [5, Theorem 2.13]. Afterward, B. Kloeckner and R.
Mazzeo generalized this result for a ﬁnite collection of Jordan curves in ∂∞(H2 × R),
[16, Proposition 4.4].
We wish next to describe brieﬂy the behavior of certain minimal surfaces in H2 × R,
for their interesting properties related to the results in this paper: First, we would like
to summarize the example given by F. Morabito and M. Rodriguez [19]: It consists
of a complete minimal surface M in H2 × R, invariant by a discrete group of vertical
translation. The ﬁnite asymptotic boundary is the ﬁnite union of vertical lines in
∂∞H2 × R. It is interesting to note that any nonempty domain S ⊂ M of ﬁnite vertical
height has ﬁnite total curvature. One can choose such S to be a vertical graph. Of
course, the surface M has inﬁnite total curvature, but the total curvature does not
concentrates in a subset S ⊂ M of bounded vertical height whose asymptotic boundary
is a vertical segment. The reader is referred to the constructions due to L. Hauswirth
and A. Menezes [11], to ﬁnd other related results.
Secondly, let us consider now a classical minimal surface M1 in H2 × R which has been
useful as barrier in many papers about minimal graphs theory, see P. Collin and H.
Rosenberg [4, Lemma 1], B. Nelli and H. Rosenberg [21, Errata corrige 4 (b)] and the
authors [28, Theorem 4.1 (3)]. The surface M1 is globally a vertical graph, see [26,
Equation (32)] for an explicit formula. Thus, M1 is stable. The surface M1 has been
characterized by I. Fern´andez and P. Mira [6]. A generalization of M1 was carried out
by the joint work of J. A. G´alvez and H. Rosenberg [9, Proposition 3.1], and by the
work of J. Plehnert [24, Section 3.2].
As a matter of fact, M1 is invariant under an one parameter group of hyperbolic
translations along a horizontal geodesic γ ⊂ H2 × {0}. Let us denote by p∞, q∞ the
asymptotic boundary of γ. Then the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M1 is composed of
two vertical half-lines ∂∞H2 × (0, +∞), issuing from p∞ and q∞, and one of the two
arcs of ∂∞H2 × {0} \ {p∞, q∞}, see [28, Proposition 2.1]. Let S be a nonempty open
subset of M1 whose asymptotic boundary is a vertical segment of the ﬁnite asymptotic
boundary of M1. Since M1 is invariant by horizontal translations, it follows that S has
inﬁnite total curvature.

We observe that in H2 ×R, ﬁnite total curvature of a complete oriented minimal surface
implies ﬁnite index. This is a theorem by P. B´erard and the ﬁrst author in [1]. Notice
that in Euclidean space a famous result of D. Fisher-Colbrie [7] states that a complete
oriented minimal surface has ﬁnite index if and only if it has ﬁnite total curvature.
Notice also that ﬁnite index does not imply ﬁnite total curvature in H2 × R, as the
preceding example shows. The catenoid in H2 × R is another counter-example: It has
inﬁnite total curvature and index one [1, Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 3.5].
We pause momentarily to ask here if the assumption “complete” can be removed from
the B´erard-Sa Earp theorem ? In R3, S.-Y. Cheng and J. Tysk showed that a complete
minimal surface with boundary and with ﬁnite index has ﬁnite total curvature [2,
Theorem 5]. Afterward, A. Grigor’yan and S.-T. Yau generalized this result assuming
only that M is a minimal surface with ﬁnite index, that is they dropped the assumption
of completness [10, Theorem 4.9].

We observe that the two examples above show that when the ﬁnite asymptotic bound-
ary of a minimal surface in H2 × R is a vertical segment then the total curvature may
be ﬁnite or inﬁnite.

2. Finite asymptotic boundary

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Convergence to an asymptotic boundary point of H2). Let y0 ∈ H2
be a ﬁxed point of H2 and let x∞ ∈ ∂∞H2. We denote by [y0, x∞) ⊂ H2 the geodesic
ray issuing from y0 and with asymptotic boundary x∞. For any ρ > 0 we denote by
γρ ⊂ H2 the geodesic intersecting the ray [y0, x∞) orthogonally at point yρ such that
dH2(y0, yρ) = ρ. Let γ+
ρ be the component of H2\γρ which contains x∞ in its asymptotic
boundary: x∞ ∈ ∂∞γ+
ρ .
Let (xn) be a sequence of points of H2. We say that (xn) converges to x∞, denoted by
xn → x∞, if for any ρ > 0 there exists nρ ∈ N such that xn ∈ γ+
We observe that if we choose the Poincar´e disc model of H2, then xn → x∞ if and only
if the sequence (xn) converges to x∞ in Euclidean sense.
Also, let us consider the Poincar´e half-plane model of H2, then in this model ∂∞H2 =
R ∪ {∞}. We have:

ρ for any n > nρ.

• If x∞ ∈ R then xn → x∞ if and only if the sequence (xn) converges to x∞ in

Euclidean sense.

• If x∞ = ∞ then xn → x∞ if and only if |xn| → +∞.

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Asymptotic boundary).

(1) We deﬁne the asymptotic boundary of H2 × R setting:

∂∞(H2 × R) :=(cid:0)∂∞H2 × R(cid:1) ∪(cid:0)H2 × {−∞, +∞}(cid:1) ∪(cid:0)∂∞H2 × {−∞, +∞}(cid:1).

This decomposition means that for a divergent sequence (pn) of H2 ×R there are
three possibilities for converging to inﬁnity (up to extracting a subsequence).
That is, setting pn = (xn, tn) ∈ H2 × R, we have the following cases:

• xn → x∞ ∈ ∂∞H2 (see Deﬁnition 2.1) and tn → t0 ∈ R. We say that

p∞ := (x∞, t0) ∈ ∂∞H2 × R is an asymptotic point at ﬁnite height.

• xn → x0 ∈ H2 and tn → ±∞. That is (pn) converges to

p∞ := (x0, ±∞) ∈ H2 × {−∞, +∞}.

• xn → x∞ ∈ ∂∞H2 and tn → ±∞. That is (pn) converges to

p∞ := (x∞, ±∞) ∈ ∂∞H2 × {−∞, +∞}.

(2) Let Ω ⊂ H2 × R be a nonempty subset. We say that a point p∞ ∈ ∂∞(H2 × R)

is an asymptotic point of Ω if there is a sequence (pn) of Ω converging to p∞.

The set of asymptotic points of Ω, called the asymptotic boundary of Ω, is

denoted by ∂∞Ω.

(3) Let Ω ⊂ H2 × R be a nonempty subset. The set of asymptotic points at ﬁnite

height is called the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary and is denoted by ∂f

∞Ω.

The complement ∂∞Ω \ ∂f

∞Ω is called the non ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of

Ω.

We say that the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary ∂f

∞Ω has bounded vertical height

∞Ω ⊂ {(ei θ, t) ∈ ∂∞H2 × R, |t| < t1}

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Boundary of a surface). Let S ⊂ H2 × R be a surface.

(1) A point p ∈ S is called an interior point of S if there exists a proper embedding
Y : D → H2 × R such that Y (D) ⊂ S and Y (0) = p. The set of interior points
of S is denoted int (S).

(2) We deﬁne the boundary of S, denoted ∂S, as:

where S is the closure of S in H2 × R, we have ∂S ⊂ H2 × R.

∂S := S \ int (S),

3. Geometric Lemmas

The following result describes, in particular, the local behavior at inﬁnity of a minimal
surface M in H2 × R, whose ﬁnite asymptotic boundary is an arc in ∂f
∞M \ ∂∞(∂M),
which is not contained in a vertical line.

Lemma 3.1. Let M be a connected immersed minimal surface in H2 × R. Assume
that:

(1) The ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M is composed of an arc α properly embedded

in ∂∞H2 × R.

(2) There exists an open and simple arc α0 ⊂ α in ∂f

∞M \ ∂∞(∂M) which is not

contained in a vertical line.

We claim that there exists ρ′(ε) > ρε such that

Mρ′(ε) ⊂ H2 × (t0 − ε, t0 + ε).

Indeed, otherwise there would exist a strictly increasing sequence (ρn) such that

• ρn > ρε for any n and ρn → +∞,

• for any n, Mρn intersects (cid:0)H2 × {t0 + ε}(cid:1) ∩ Π+

that the asymptotic point (x∞, t0 ± ε) belongs to the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M,
which gives a contradiction with (1) and (2), with ρ = ρε, and the assumption that p∞
does not belong to a vertical segment contained in α0.
Now we set

By the analytic continuation property, we get that M ⊂ H2 × {t0}, which leads to a
contradiction.
Notice that the same argument shows that, if M is not contained in H2 × {t0}, P +

In our context, it is natural to expect that the area of a minimal surface M in H2 × R
is inﬁnite. More precisely, we derive the following result.

Lemma 3.2. Let M be a minimal surface immersed into H2 × R. Assume that the
ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of the boundary of M is not equal to the ﬁnite asymptotic
boundary of the boundary of M, that is ∂f
∞M. Then M has inﬁnite area.

∞(∂M) 6= ∂f

∞(∂M).

∞M \ ∂f

Proof. By assumption there exists a ﬁnite asymptotic point p∞ of M which is not an
asymptotic point of the boundary of M: p ∈ ∂f
Let (pn) be a sequence of points of M which converges to p∞, see Deﬁnition 2.2. Let
δ > 0 be a ﬁxed real number. Then, since p∞ is not an asymptotic boundary point of
∂M, there exists n0 ∈ N such that dM (pn, ∂M) > 2δ for any n > n0, where dM means
the intrinsic distance on M.
For each n, let D(pn, δ) ⊂ M be the geodesic disc on M centered at pn and with radius
δ. Then for any n > n0 we have D(pn, δ) ∩ ∂M = ∅.
Furthermore, up to extracting a subsequence, we can assume that there exists n1 ∈ N,
n1 > n0, such that D(pn, δ) ∩ D(pm, δ) = ∅ for any m, n > n1.
In an other hand, a result of K. Frensel [8, Theorem 3 and Remark 4] states that there
exists a ﬁxed real number α > 0 such that Area (D(pn, δ)) > α for any n > n1. We
conclude that M has inﬁnite area.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.1. The assumption on the asymptotic boundary in Lemma 3.2 is crucial
as we can see from the following examples.

(1) A geodesic triangle in H2 with one, or more, vertices in the asymptotic boundary
of H2 has ﬁnite area [29, Lemme 2.5.23 and Th´eor`eme. 2.5.24]. We observe that
the asymptotic boundary of the triangle is equal to the asymptotic boundary
of its boundary.

(2) We can construct a domain in H2 with ﬁnite area and whose the asymptotic

boundary is the whole ∂∞H2.

Indeed, consider the Poincar´e disc model of H2. For any ρ > 0 we denote by

Sρ ⊂ H2 the circle centered at 0 with radius ρ.

Let (ρn) be a strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that
ρn → +∞. Now we consider another sequence of positive real numbers (ρ′
n),
n > ρn, such that, calling An the open annulus bounded by the circles Sρn and
ρ′
Sρ′
n, we have:
• the annuli An are mutually disjoint,
• Area (An) < 1

n2 for any n ∈ N∗.

Let y0 ∈ H2, y0 6= 0, be any point on the imaginary axis such that its hyperbolic
distance to 0 is lesser that ρ1/2. We call T the open geodesic triangle with
vertices 0, y0 and 1, observe that this last vertex is the unique vertex of T
belonging to the asymptotic boundary of H2.

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

Then we set U := T ∪ Sn>1 An. By construction U is a domain of H2

satisfying:

• Area (U) is ﬁnite, (since Area (T ) is ﬁnite [29, Lemme 2.5.23]).
• ∂∞U = ∂∞H2 and also ∂∞(∂U) = ∂∞H2.

In particular the asymptotic

boundary of U is equal to the asymptotic boundary of its boundary.

Observe that the domain U is inﬁnitely connected. We can modify slightly
U in order to obtain a simply connected domain. For that we consider a ﬁxed
point x0 ∈ H2, x0 6= 0, on the real axis such that its hyperbolic distance to 0 is
lesser that ρ1/2. We call Σ+ (resp. Σ−) the closed geodesic triangle in H2 with
vertices 0, x0 and i (resp. 0, x0 and −i). We set

Ω := T ∪(cid:0)[k>1

A2k \ Σ+(cid:1) ∪(cid:0)[k>1

A2k−1 \ Σ−(cid:1).

We have by construction Ω ⊂ U, therefore Ω has ﬁnite area. Furthermore:

• Ω is a simply connected domain,
• ∂∞Ω = ∂∞H2 and also ∂∞(∂Ω) = ∂∞H2.

In particular the asymptotic

boundary of Ω is equal to the asymptotic boundary of its boundary.

4. Main Theorem

Theorem 4.1. Let M be a connected and oriented minimal surface immersed in H2× R
(not necessarily complete). As in Lemma 3.1 we assume that

(1) The ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M is composed of an arc α properly embedded

in ∂∞H2 × R.

(2) There exists an open and simple arc α0 ⊂ α in ∂f

∞M \ ∂∞(∂M) which is not

contained in a vertical line.

Assume further that M is stable. Then M has inﬁnite total curvature.
Moreover, let p∞ := (x∞, t0) ∈ ∂∞H2 × R, be any point of α0 which does not belong to
a vertical segment contained in α0. Then |n3(p)| → 1 if p → p∞, p ∈ M, where n3 is
the third coordinate of the Gauss map of M.

Proof. Observe that, taking into account Lemma 3.2, if M is contained in a slice
H2 × {t0} then there is nothing to prove. Thus from now we assume that M is not
contained in a slice.
We recall the Gauss equation of the immersion (see [14, Lemma 4]):

K = Kext − n2
3,

(3)

where K is the Gaussian curvature and Kext is the extrinsic curvature.
Since M is a minimal surface, we have K 6 −n2
3.

By assumption, the ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M is an arc α, and there exists a
simple arc α0 ⊂ ∂f
∞M \ ∂∞(∂M), α0 ⊂ α, which is not contained in a vertical line. Let
p∞ := (x∞, t0) ∈ α0 as in the statement.

For any ε > 0 we consider the minimal surface Sε ⊂ M given by Lemma 3.1.

Claim For any real number c ∈ (0, 1), there exists ε > 0 such that |n3(p)| > c for any
p ∈ Sε. Consequently,

|n3(p)| → 1, if p → p∞, p ∈ M.

Let us assume momentarily that the Claim holds.
Using the Claim above and the Gauss equation (3), we have

ZM

K dA 6ZSε

K dA 6 −c2Area(Sε).

By combining with Lemma 3.2, we deduce therefore that M has inﬁnite total curvature,
as desired. Thus it remains to prove the Claim.

Proof of the Claim.
Assume, by contradiction, that the Claim does not hold. Then, there exists a ﬁxed
number c ∈ (0, 1) such that for any n ∈ N∗ there is a point pn ∈ S1/n satisfying

|n3(pn)| 6 c

(5)

It follows from Lemma 3.1-(6) (or from its proof), that pn → p∞ as n → ∞, see
Deﬁnition 2.2.
Let n0 ∈ N∗ be a positive integer. We have pn ∈ S 1
for any integer n > n0 large
enough. Therefore, up to extracting a subsequence, we can assume that for any n ∈ N∗,
n > n0, we have dM (pn, ∂S 1

) > 1, where dM is the intrinsic distance on M.

From now on we consider the Poincar´e disc model of H2. Letting pn := (xn, tn) ∈
H2 × R, for any n > n0 we denote by Tn the hyperbolic translation on H2 along the
geodesic passing through xn and 0, such that Tn(xn) = 0. We also denote by Tn the
horizontal translation of H2 × R induced by this isometry of H2.
Now we proceed as in the proof of [30, Theorem 2.5].

deduce from [25, Main Theorem] that, far away from the boundary, we have uniform

which does not depend on n, or on n0, such that for any n > n0, a part Σn of Tn(cid:16)S 1

We consider H2 × R as an open set of Euclidean space R3. We deduce from [25,
Proposition 2.3] and from [30, Proposition A.1], that there exists a real number δ > 0,

is the Euclidean graph of a function u deﬁned on the disc centered at point Tn(pn) with
Euclidean radius δ in the tangent plane of Σn at Tn(pn). Furthermore, the norm of the
Euclidean gradient of the function u is bounded above by 1.

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

11

As a matter of fact, from the discussion after the proof of Lemma 2.4 in [3], we get the
following.

Fact: for any r ∈ (0, 1) there exists δ(r) ∈ (0, δ) such that the norm of the gradient

of the function u is bounded above by r on the disc of Euclidean radius δ(r)

(6)

Observe that we can use [3, Lemma 2.4] since we have a priori estimates for the norm of
the Euclidean second fundamental form. Those estimates follow from [30, Proposition
A.1].

Observe that, since dM(cid:16)Tn(pn), ∂Tn(cid:16)S 1
n0(cid:17) = ∅.
can be chosen so that Σn ∩ ∂Tn(cid:16)S 1
Let νn be the unitary normal along Tn(cid:16)S 1

n0(cid:17)(cid:17) > 1 for any n > n0 > 0, the constant δ
n0(cid:17) in the Euclidean metric. We denote

by νn,3 the vertical component of νn. Recall that |n3(pn)| < c for any n > n0 > 0,
see (5). Comparing the product metric of H2 × R with the Euclidean metric, it can
be shown that there exists c′ ∈ (0, 1), which does not depend on n or n0, such that
|νn,3(T (pn))| < c′ for any n > n0 > 0, (see the formula of the unit normal vector ﬁeld
of a vertical graph in the proof of [31, Proposition 3.2]).

This implies that the tangent planes of Σn at points T (pn) have a Euclidean slope
bounded from below uniformly (with respect to n > n0).
We recall that S 1
), see Lemma 3.1, thus the same occurs for
n0
any Σn. We infer therefore a contradiction with the fact (6) above since then, for n0
large enough and n > n0, the surface Σn would intersect H2 × {t0 ± 1

}.

Remark 4.1. As a matter of fact, in Theorem 4.1 the stability assumption is only
used to ensure a priori estimates for the second fundamental form of M. We think that
stability is a hypothesis simpler to handle than bounded second fundamental form
since, for example, any vertical or horizontal minimal graph is stable.

Remark 4.2. Given a bounded function g on ∂∞H2 × {0}, continuous except perhaps
at a ﬁnite set of points S, there exists a minimal entire extension u of g [28, Corollary
4.1, Remark 4 (2)]. We remark that the problem of Dirichlet at inﬁnity (g is continuous)
was solved by B. Nelli and H. Rosenberg [20], [21].
Theorem 4 ensures that these entire graphs have inﬁnite total curvature.
However, the fact that all non trivial (g 6≡ cst) such entire graphs have inﬁnite total cur-
vature, follows directly from Huber theorem [15, Theorem 15], see also [32, Th´eor`eme
2. 4. 10]: In fact, a complete simply connected minimal surface immersed into H2 × R
of ﬁnite total curvature is conformally equivalent to C.

12

R. SA EARP AND E. TOUBIANA

On the other hand, it is well-known that the height function of a minimal surface
M conformally immersed into H2 × R is a harmonic function on M, see for instance
[27, Proposition 7]. Thus, by combining this two facts we derive that the ﬁnite total
curvature assumption would lead to a contradiction, because there is no non constant
bounded harmonic function over C.

Corollary 4.1. Let M be a minimal graph in H2 × R such that its ﬁnite asymptotic
boundary is a graph over an arc of ∂∞H2 × {0} and is diﬀerent from the asymptotic
boundary of ∂M. Then M has inﬁnite total curvature.
Furthermore, for any interior point p∞ of ∂f
|n3(p)| → 1 if p → p∞, p ∈ M.

∞M such that p∞ /∈ ∂f

∞(∂M), we have

Corollary 4.2. Let M be an oriented stable minimal surface immersed into H2×R with
compact boundary (e.g. a minimal graph with compact boundary), whose asymptotic
boundary is a (continuous) graph over the whole ∂∞H2 × {0}. Then M has inﬁnite
total curvature.
Furthermore, if p∞ ∈ ∂∞M, we have |n3(p)| → 1 if p → p∞, p ∈ M.

Remark 4.3. The above Corollary applies to a minimal graph with compact boundary
whose asymptotic boundary is a graph over ∂∞H2 × {0}. We refer to [28, Theorem 5.1]
for a existence result of such graphs, when the boundary is a Jordan curve C ⊂ H2×{0}
satisfying an “exterior circle of radius ρ condition” . So, all of these examples have
inﬁnite (intrinsic) total curvature, by applying the Corollary 4.2.
In the classical case of the end of a catenoid, the above Corollary follows from an
explicit computation carry out in [1, Proof of the Proposition 3.3].

5. A particular example

We consider the Poincar´e disc model of H2. Let θ0 ∈ (0, π/2) be a ﬁxed number. Let
γ ⊂ H2 be the geodesic with asymptotic boundary {1, eiθ0}.
Let U ⊂ H2 be the domain whose boundary is the union of the geodesic rays [0, 1)
and [0, i) with the geodesic γ, whose asymptotic boundary is the asymptotic arc γ∞ :=
{eiθ, θ0 6 θ 6 π/2} of ∂∞H2 with the point 1.
Let A > π be a real number to be chosen later. We consider the Dirichlet problem (P )
on U with boundary data

• 0 on the geodesic rays [0, 1) and [0, i),
• −A on the asymptotic arc γ∞,
• +∞ on the geodesic γ.

Using [28, Theorem 4.1] and the minimal surface M1 described in [28, proposition 2.1
(2)], as in [28, Example 4.1] or as in [31, Theorem 5.1 (n=2)], we can solve the Dirichlet
problem (P ) above and ﬁnd a solution g : U → R whose ﬁnite asymptotic boundary
of the graph, M, is

(cid:16){i} × [−A, 0](cid:17) ∪(cid:16)γ∞ × {−A}(cid:17) ∪(cid:16){eiθ0} × [−A, +∞)(cid:17) ∪(cid:16){1} × [0, +∞)(cid:17)

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

13

and the non ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M is

(cid:16)γ × {+∞}(cid:17) ∪(cid:16){1, eiθ0} × {+∞}(cid:17).

We claim that the following phenomena hold.

Claim 1. Let p∞, q∞ be points in γ∞ such that p∞, q∞ 6= eiθ0, i. Let α ⊂ H2 be the
geodesic whose asymptotic boundary is {p∞, q∞}. We call U1 ⊂ H2 the component of
H2 \ α whose asymptotic boundary is the subarc [p∞, q∞] of γ∞. We have U1 ⊂ U. Let
S1 ⊂ M be the graph of g restrited to U1.
Then it follows from Corollary 4.1 that S1 has inﬁnite total curvature.
Furthermore, we have |n3(q)| → 1 if q → γ∞ \ {eiθ0, i}, q ∈ U1.

Claim 2. Let S2 ⊂ M be a domain such that its asymptotic boundary is a compact

arc of (cid:16){1} × [0, +∞)(cid:17). Then it can be showed that S2 has ﬁnite total curvature.

In order to outline the proof of Claim (2), we state the following facts.

(1) Let V ⊂ U be a subdomain such that its asymptotic boundary is constituted of
zero, one or two points of ∂∞U. If g is constant along the boundary of V , then
g is constant on V , which leads to a contradiction.

To prove this fact we use the maximum principle and the family of complete
minimal surfaces Md, d > 1, described in [28, Proposition 2.1-(1)] and in the
proof of [22, Theorem 3.2].

(2) The function g has no critical points on U.

Indeed, if g would have a critical point p ∈ U, with g(p) = c > −A, then in a
neighborhhod of p, the level set g−1({c}) is constituted at least of four analytic
arcs issuing from p. Observe that any level set of g cannot have end points
in U. Observe also that the asymptotic boundary of the level set g−1({c}) is
included in {1, eiθ0, i}. Therefore, continuing any of the analytic arcs issuing
from p, we obtain a domain V as in item (1), which leads to a contradiction.

(3) For any real number c ∈ (−A, +∞), the level set g−1({c}) is constituted of an
unique simple divergent curve in U and its asymptotic boundary is contained in
{1, eiθ0, i}.

To proof this assertion, we ﬁrst study the diﬀerent possible cases of the level
set g−1({0}). Then for each one of those cases we apply the items (1) and (2).
(4) Using the reﬂection principle along the two geodesic rays starting from the orig-
ine and whose asymptotic boundary are {1} and {i} respectively, we obtain a

complete minimal surface fM ⊂ H2 × R which is a graph. Hence fM is stable

and from [25, Main Theorem] we obtain global upper estimates for the norm of
the second fundamental form of M. Observe that those upper estimates do not
depend on A.

14

R. SA EARP AND E. TOUBIANA

We denote by (0, 1) the open geodesic ray starting at 0 whose asymptotic
boundary is 1. We denote by R the reﬂection in H2 × R with respect to the
geodesic ray (0, 1) and we set M ∗ := M ∪ (0, 1) ∪ R(M). Then M ∗ is a minimal
surface which is a graph over the domain U1 := U ∪ (0, 1) ∪ R(U) of D.

(5) For any ρ > 0 we set Zρ = {ξ ∈ U1, dH2(ξ, γ) < ρ}. Then, for any c ∈ (0, 1)
there exists ρc > 0 such that |n3(ξ)| < c, for any ξ ∈ Zρc. Furthermore the
number ρc does not depend on A.

Indeed, if the assertion is not true, there would exist a sequence (pn) in U1

such that

• dH2(pn, γ) → 0,
• |n3(pn)| > c for any n.

Let ξ0 ∈ γ be any ﬁxed point, we set D1 := {ξ ∈ U, dH2(ξ, ξ0) < 1}.
Observe that for any n large enough we can use a translation Tn along the
geodesic γ to send pn on a point Tn(pn) in the domain D1. By construction we
have that dH2(Tn(pn), γ) → 0. Using the global upper estimates for the norm
of the second fundamental form of M, we can proceed as in the proof of the
Claim in Theorem 4.1 to reach a contradiction. Since those upper estimates do
not depend on A, we obtain also that the number ρc does not depend on A.

(6) From now on, we choose a ﬁxed number c ∈ (0, 1). Let ρc > 0 be the positive
real number given in item (5). We call α ∈ U the geodesic whose asymptotic
boundary is {i, eiθ0}. We denote by MdA, dA > 1, the surface of the family Md,
described in [28, Proposition 2.1-(1)] and in the proof of [22, Theorem 3.2], such
that

• the height of MdA is A,
• MdA is symmetric with respect to the slice H2 × {0},
• for any t ∈ (− A

2 ) the intersection MdA ∩(cid:0)H2 × {t}(cid:1) is an equidistant

curve of the geodesic α.

2 , A

Then, we have M ∩ MdA = ∅. Consequently, we have M ∩ (MdA + (0, 0, t)) = ∅
for any t > 0.

Observe that, using the notations of [28, Proposition 2.1-(1)] we have A =

2H(dA). Moreover the asymptotic boundary of MdA is

Let θ1 ∈ (θ0, π/2) be a ﬁxed number and let β ⊂ H2 be the geodesic whose

asymptotic boundary is {−eiθ1, eiθ1}.

To prove the ﬁrst assertion we consider the hyperbolic translation along the
geodesic β and proceed as in [22, Theorem 3.2]. The second assertion is a
consequence of the ﬁrst one.

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

(7) Let δ0 ⊂ H2 be the geodesic ray issuing from 0 and with asymptotic boundary
{eiθ0}. For any r > 0 we denote by Qr the vertical geodesic plane intersecting
orthogonally δ0 at distance r from 0. Let Q+
r ⊂ H2 × R be the component of
(H2 × R) \ Qr containing eiθ0 in its asymptotic boundary.

Let c ∈ (0, 1) be a ﬁxed number and let ρc > 0 be the positive real number

given in item (5).

Then, if A is large enough, there exists r > 0 so that

(cid:0)M ∩ Q+

r(cid:1) ∩ {t > 0} ⊂ Zρc × [0, +∞).

(7)

The proof of the assertion is based upon the following observation.
Since ρc > 0 does not depend on A, observe that for A > 0 large enough we

have MdA ∩(cid:0)Zρc ×[0, +∞)(cid:1) 6= ∅. For such a number A, using the last aﬃrmation

of item (6) certainly we can ﬁnd a number r > 0 large enough satisfying (7).

Now we pause momentarily to recall some facts derived from [12], [14] and

[30].

Let X : D → H2 × R be a conformal parametrization of M. We set as in [30]
X = (F, h), thus F : (D, geuc) → H2 is a harmonic map and h : D → R is a
harmonic function, where geuc is the Euclidean metric.

Since g has no critical point on U, we have |n3| 6= 1 along M. Therefore we

can deﬁne a real function ω on D by the relation: tanh ω = n3.

We consider also the function φ on D deﬁned by φ := (σ ◦ F )FzF z, where σ
is the conformal factor of the hyperbolic metric of H2. Since F is a harmonic
map, φ is a holomorphic function.

The metric induced on D by the immersion X is

ds2 = 4 cosh2(ω) |φ| |dz|2.

Moreover we have φ(z) = −(hz(z))2, [27, Proposition 1]. Now we deﬁne a
holomorphic function W on D setting

W (z) =Z pφ(z) dz,

where the square root of φ is chosen so that

h = 2 Im W (z)

(8)

(8) The function W is a univalent map, hence W is a holomorphic diﬀeomorphism

between D and the open subset eΩ := W (D) of C.

It follows from item (3) that for any c ∈ (−A, +∞), the level curve h−1({c})
is constituted of an unique simple divergent curve in D. We deduce from item
(2) that h has no critical point. Consequently the conjugate function ∗h is
strictly monotonous along any level curve of h. Combining with Formula (8)
we conclude that W is an univalent map.

16

R. SA EARP AND E. TOUBIANA

(9)

where ∆ is the Laplacian for the Euclidean metric.

Now we deﬁne the function eω on eΩ setting
eω := ω ◦ W −1.
We know from [12, Formula (12)] that the function eω satisﬁes
∆eω = 2 sinheω,
We consider also the new conformal parametrization eX : eΩ → H2 × R of M
given by eX = X ◦ W −1. Denoting by w the coordinate on eΩ, the induced metric
on eΩ reads as
We deﬁne also the function W0 : U → eΩ ⊂ C setting W0 := W ◦ (Π ◦ X)−1,

where Π : H2×R → H2 is the ﬁrst projection. As a matter of fact, W0 is nothing
but the function W read on U, in particular W0 is an open map. Observe also
that by means of the reﬂections with respect to the geodesic rays (0, 1) and
(0, i) issuing from 0 with asymptotic boundary {1} and {i} respectively, the

des2 = 4 cosh2eω(w) |dw|2,

(11)

(10)

map W0 can be extended to a larger open set bU ⊂ D containing U and the

open geodesic rays, and this extended map is still an open map.

Observe also that g = 2 Im W0.
Since g = h ◦ (Π ◦ X)−1, we deﬁne the “conjugate function” ∗g setting
∗g := ∗h ◦ (Π ◦ X)−1. Since g has no critical point on U, we observe that
∗g is strictly monotonous on any level curve of g. From the relation (8) we get
that ∗g = −2 Re W0.

(9) The level curve L0 := g−1({0}) cannot be a simple curve with asymptotic bound-
ary the set {1, eiθ0}. Consequently, the level curve L0 must have one of the
following behaviors.

• ∂∞L0 = {eiθ0, i},
• ∂∞L0 = {eiθ0} and L0 has an end point on [0, 1) ∪ (0, i).
Let us assume, by absurd, that ∂∞L0 = {1, eiθ0}. Let p0 ∈ L0 be a ﬁxed
0 the components of L0 \ {p} with asymptotic

point. We denote by L+
0 and L−
boundary 1 and eiθ0 respectively.

Recall that from item (6) we have ﬁxed a number c ∈ (0, 1) and from item

(5) there exists ρc > 0 such that |n3(ξ)| < c for any ξ ∈ Zρc.

We deduce from item (7) that, up to extracting a compact part, we can

assume that L+

0 ⊂ Zρc and L−

0 ⊂ Zρc.

Since the graph of L+

0 on M has inﬁnite length, the curve W0(L+

0 ) ⊂ eΩ must
have inﬁnite length as well, for the metric des2, see (11).
As |n3| < c on Zρc, we get that the function eω is bounded on Zρc. Thus, the
0 ) ⊂ eΩ ⊂ C must have inﬁnite Euclidean length. We deduce that

Re W0(ξ) → ±∞,

if ξ → 1, ξ ∈ L0.

curve W0(L+

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

17

Without loss of generality, we can assume that Re W0(ξ) → +∞ when ξ → 1,
ξ ∈ L0.

In the same way, and using the fact that Re W0 is strictly monotonous on

any level curve of g, we get that

Re W0(ξ) → −∞,

if ξ → eiθ0, ξ ∈ L0.

Consequently the image of the level curve L0, W0(L0), is the whole real axis in
C: W0(L0) = R ⊂ C. We arrive to a contradiction as follows.

Note that g can be extended across the geodesic ray (0, 1) by means of the
reﬂection principle. Note also that the critical points of the extended map, if
any, are isolated.

Let p1 ∈ (0, i) be a ﬁxed point in the geodesic ray which is not a critical
point of g. Thus W0 is a local diﬀeomorphism near p1. Let O1 be an open
neighborhood of p1 such that W0 is one-to-one on O1. Since W0(L0) = R ⊂ C,
there exists p2 ∈ L0 such that W0(p1) = W0(p2). Now let O2 ⊂ U be any open
neighborhood of p2. As W0 is an open map, we get that W0(O1) ∩ W0(O2) is
an open set containing W0(p2), which gives a contradiction with the fact W0 is
one-to-one on U.

(10) Let U + := {ξ ∈ U, g(ξ) > 0} and let Ω+ := {w ∈ C, Im w > 0}. Then

W0(U +) = Ω+ ⊂ eΩ.

Indeed, for any c > 0 we set Lc := g−1({c}). Thus W0(Lc) is contained in
the horizontal line of Ω+ at height 2c: W0(Lc) ⊂ {w ∈ C, Im w = 2c}, since
g = 2 Im W0.

We can prove in the same way as in the proof of item (9), that W0(Lc) is the

H0(C) and H1(C) and vertical sides V0(C) and V1(C) deﬁned by

• H0(C) is the horizontal segment with end points u0 and u0 + C),
• H1(C) is the horizontal segment with end points u0 + iC and u0 + C + iC,
• V0(C) is the vertical segment with end points u0 and u0 + iC,
• V1(C) is the vertical segment with end points u0 + C and u0 + C + iC,

We choose the following parametrization of V0(C),

γ(t) = u0 + i tC,

t ∈ [0, 1].

Let w = u + iv be the coordinates on eΩ. We deduce from the expression of the
metric des2, see Formula (11), and from [17, Formula (42.8)], that the geodesic

exists a positive constant δ such that for any w ∈ Θ with d(w, ∂Θ) > 2 we have

6. Some examples of infinite total curvature minimal surfaces in

H2 × R and their asymptotic boundary

Next we exhibit complete and non-complete minimal surfaces M generated by verti-
cal graphs, pointing out some geometric properties. For this purpose we choose the
Poincar´e disc model of H2.

Example 6.1. M is non-complete, properly embedded and its asymptotic boundary is
the union of a discrete set in ∂∞H2 × R, with

• either the whole (H2 ∪ ∂∞H2) × {−∞, +∞},

• or a ﬁnite subset of ∂∞H2 × {−∞, +∞} and Sn

H2 is a complete geodesic, i = 1, . . . , n.

i=1 γi × {−∞, +∞}, where γi ⊂

To obtain such a surface we consider, for θ ∈ (0, π/2) the geodesic triangle T with
vertices 0, 1 and eiθ. Let c > 0 be a positive real number. Let γ ⊂ H2 be the geodesic
with asymptotic boundary the points 1 and eiθ.
Let f : γ → R be a continuous and one to one function, such that f (ξ) → 0 if ξ → eiθ
and f (ξ) → c if ξ → 1.
We consider the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation on int(T ) taking

− c on the geodesic ray (0, 1),
− 0 on the geodesic ray (0, eiθ),
− f on γ.

We deduce from [28, Theorem 4.1] that there exists a solution u to this problem. Thus
the graph S of u is a minimal surface whose boundary contains the geodesic rays
(0, 1) × {c} and (0, eiθ) × {0}, the vertical segment {(0, t) ∈ H2 × R, 0 6 t 6 c} and

boundary {−ξi, ξi}, i = 1, . . . , n.

H2 is a complete geodesic, i = 1, . . . , n.

Let θ ∈ (0, π/2) be a ﬁxed number. We denote by Γθ ⊂ ∂∞H2 the closed arc of ∂∞H2
bounded by 1 and eiθ which does not contain i.
Let Dθ ⊂ H2 be the domain bounded by the geodesic rays (0, 1) and (0, eiθ) and whose
asymptotic boundary is Γθ.
Let f : Γθ → R be a continuous and one to one function, such that f (eiθ) = 0 and and
f (1) = c, where c > 0 is a positive number.
We consider the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation on Dθ taking the
boundary data

TOTAL CURVATURE OF MINIMAL SURFACES

21

We deduce from [28, Theorem 4.1] that there exists a solution u to this problem. Thus
the graph S of u is a minimal surface whose boundary contains the geodesic rays (0, 1)
and (0, eiθ) and the vertical segment {(0, t) ∈ H2 × R, 0 6 t 6 c}.
Now we perform the reﬂection of S with respect to the vertical geodesic {0} × R and
with respect to the geodesic rays (0, 1), (0, eiθ) and the new geodesic rays appearing in
this process.
In this way we get a complete and properly embedded minimal surface M invariant by
a discrete group of screw-motions. The ﬁnite asymptotic boundary is composed of to
“helix type” curves. We deduce from Theorem 4.1 that M has inﬁnite total curvature.
To describe the non ﬁnite asymptotic boundary of M we consider two cases.

• If the angle θ/π is irrational then the non ﬁnite asymptotic boundary is the

whole (H2 ∪ ∂∞H2) × {−∞, +∞}.

• If the angle θ/π is rational then the non ﬁnite asymptotic boundary is composed
of a ﬁnite subset {±ξ1, . . . , ±ξn} × {−∞, +∞} of ∂∞H2 × {−∞, +∞} and
i=1 γi × {−∞, +∞}, where γi ⊂ H2 is the complete geodesic with asymptotic

boundary {−ξi, ξi}, i = 1, . . . , n.

Sn

Example 6.3. M is non properly immersed and its asymptotic boundary is an annulus
∂∞H2 × [−a, a], where a > 0.

In order to construct such an example, we proceed as in Example 6.2 above, setting
c = 0, f (1) = a, f (eiθ) = 0 and θ/π is irrational. Observe that this surface is complete
far away from the origin.

Example 6.4. The asymptotic boundary of M is either ∂∞(H2×R)\(D×{−∞, +∞}),
where D is an open geodesic disc of H2 or the whole asymptotic boundary of H2 × R.

We proceed as in Example 6.1 above, now c > 0 is a nonnegative constant and f ≡ +∞
on the geodesic γ.
It can be shown, using [28, Theorem 4.1] that this Dirichlet problem has a solution.
We choose θ such that θ/π is irrational.
After performing all reﬂections we get a minimal surface M. To describe the surface
M we consider two cases.

• c = 0. In this case M is complete far away from the origin and is non properly
immersed. Its asymptotic boundary is ∂∞(H2 × R) \ (D × {−∞, +∞}), where
D ⊂ H2 is the open geodesic disc centered at 0 and such that D ∩ γ = ∅ and
D ∩ γ 6= ∅.

• c > 0.

In this case M is complete, properly immersed, and its asymptotic

boundary is the whole asymptotic boundary of H2 × R.

Example 6.5. M is complete and dense in H2 × R.
Therefore its asymptotic boundary is the whole asymptotic boundary of H2 × R.

We proceed as in Example 6.1 above with the following modiﬁcations.

• f ≡ +∞ on the geodesic γ.

• On the geodesic ray (0, eiθ) we consider the constant boundary data 0.
• On the geodesic ray (0, 1) we consider the boundary data g given by

g =


π on (0, 1/3)
1 on (1/3, 2/3)
0 on (2/3, 1)

We choose θ such that θ/π is irrational.
It can be shown, using [28, Theorem 4.1] that this Dirichlet problem has a solution.
The complete minimal surface M obtained by doing all reﬂections is dense.

All the minimal examples above have inﬁnite total curvature.
