Introduction

In this paper we study two mildly related problems that involve distinct distances in a
point set. The unifying theme of these problems is that they are both based on a common
technical tool (Lemma 2.7 below).

Distinct distances on a curve. The distinct distances problem of Erd˝os [8] asks for
the minimum number of distinct distances spanned by any set P of n points in the plane.

The √n × √n integer grid in the plane induces Θ(n/√log n) distinct distances, and Erd˝os

conjectured that this number is asymptotically tight. In a recent breakthrough, Guth and
Katz [10] proved that every set of n points in the plane spans at least Ω(n/ log n) distinct
distances, which almost matches Erd˝os’s upper bound.

An instance of the problem suggested by Purdy (e.g., see [1, Section 5.5]) asks for the
minimum number of distinct distances spanned by pairs of P1 × P2, where, for each i = 1, 2,
Pi is a set of n points that lie on a line ℓi. Elekes and R´onyai [6] showed that, in contrast with
the general case, this number is at least ω(n), unless the lines ℓ1, ℓ2 are either orthogonal
or parallel to one another (where in the latter cases sets with only O(n) distinct distances
between them can then be constructed). Sharir, Sheﬀer, and Solymosi [14] strengthened
the result by showing that the number of distinct distances spanned by P1 × P2 in the
∗Work on this paper was supported by Grant 892/13 from the Israel Science Foundation, by the Israeli
Centers of Research Excellence (I-CORE) program (Center No. 4/11), and by a Shulamit Aloni Fellowship
from the Israeli Ministry of Science.

non-parallel, non-orthogonal case is at least Ω(n4/3). This result was later generalized by
Pach and De Zeeuw [12] to the case where, for i = 1, 2, Pi is a set of points that lie on some
irreducible constant-degree algebraic curve γi in the plane. They showed that in this case
the number of distinct distances spanned by P1 × P2 is again at least Ω(n4/3), unless γ1, γ2
is either a pair of orthogonal lines, a pair of (possibly coinciding) parallel lines, or a pair of
(possibly coinciding) concentric circles.

The ﬁrst to consider the distinct distances problem (in the plane and in higher dimen-
sions), with points restricted to an arbitrary constant-degree algebraic curve, was Char-
alambides [2]. He showed that if a set P of n points lies on a constant-degree algebraic
curve γ in RD, for any D ≥ 2, then the number of distinct distances spanned by P is
at least Ω(n5/4), unless γ is an algebraic helix, deﬁned as follows (see Charalambides [2,
Deﬁnition 1.5 and Lemma 7.4]).
Deﬁnition 1.1. An algebraic helix is an irreducible algebraic curve γ ⊂ RD which is either
a straight line, or has a parameterization of the form

γ(t) = (a1 cos(λ1t), a1 sin(λ1t), . . . , ak cos(λkt), ak sin(λkt)) ∈ R2k,

for some embedding of R2k in RD, with k ≤ D/2, and where all the ratios λj/λi are rational,
for i, j = 1, . . . , k.

In the plane an algebraic helix is just a line or a circle, so the result of Pach and De Zeeuw
provides a generalization (to the bipartite case) and an improved bound of Charalmbides’
result for the case D = 2.

The ﬁrst main result of this paper is to show that the bound Ω(n5/4) in [2] can be
replaced by Ω(n4/3) also for D > 2, essentially by combining the general result of Raz,
Sharir, and De Zeeuw [13] with the analysis in [2]. More precisely, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 1.2. Let γ be an irreducible constant-degree algebraic curve in RD, for any D ≥ 3.
Then every set P of n points on γ spans at least Ω(n4/3) distinct distances, with a constant
of proportionality that depends only on the degree of γ (and is independent of D), unless γ
is an algebraic helix.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 is given in Section 3.

Subsets with all-distinct distances. A related problem of Erd˝os [8] asks for hd(n), the
maximum t such that every set P of n points in Rd contains a subset S of t points such

that all (cid:0)t
2(cid:1) distances between the pairs of points in S are distinct. Erd˝os conjectured that
h1(n) = (1 + o(1))√n. The set P = {1, . . . , n} gives the upper bound h1(n) = O(√n), while
a lower bound of the form h1(n) = Ω(√n) follows from a result of Koml´os, Sulyok, and
Szemer´edi [11] (see Section 2.1 for a proof of this fact and more details). In two dimensions,
utilizing an important estimate from the work of Guth and Katz [10], Charalambides [3]

proved that h2(n) = Ω((n/ log n)1/3). The √n×√n grid has O(n/√log n) distinct distances
and it follows that h2(n) = O(n1/2/(log n)1/4). In higher dimensions, Thiele [15] showed
that hd(n) = Ω(n1/(3d−2)), and this was recently improved by Conlon et al. [4] to hd(n) =
Ω(n1/(3d−3)(log n)1/3−2/(3d−3)).

Conlon et al. [4] investigated the more general function ha,d(n), the largest integer t such
that any set of n points in Rd contains a subset of t points for which all the non-zero (a− 1)-
dimensional volumes of the (cid:0)t
a(cid:1) subsets of size a are distinct. Note that h2,d(n) = hd(n).
They showed that ha,d(n) = Ω(n
(2a−1)d ) for all (constant) a and d. In addition, and as a
tool for bounding ha,d(n), they introduced a more general notion ha(V, n), for V ⊂ RD a d-
dimensional1 irreducible variety, which is the largest integer t such that any set of n points in
V contains a subset of t points for which all the non-zero (a− 1)-dimensional volumes of the
(cid:0)t
a(cid:1) subsets of size a are distinct. They then consider the quantity ha,d,r(n) := minV ha(V, n),
where the minimum ranges over all d-dimensional irreducible varieties V of degree r. It was
(2a−1)d(cid:17) , with a constant of proportionality that depends on

h2,d,r(n) = Ω(cid:16)n

4

9+12(d−1)(cid:17) ,

where the constant of proportionality depends on d and r.

The proof of Theorem 1.3 is given in Section 4.

The common technical core. As already noted, there is a technical core behind Theo-
rems 1.2 and 1.3, which is an application of a recent result of Raz, Sharir, and De Zeeuw [13]
(which is a strengthened version of the Elekes-Szab´o theorem [7]). More precisely, for our
purposes we need a somewhat stronger version of the result of [13], that we establish in
Lemma 2.7, which is the main technical tool used for our proofs.

Roughly speaking, Lemma 2.7 says that, in the context of distances2 between points
that lie on some constant-degree irreducible algebraic curve, there are two dichotomic types
of curves: The ﬁrst type is of curves that locally behave like a line, in the sense that, by
choosing the right parameterization, the distance between a pair of points p = γ(t), q = γ(s)
on the curve, is given as a function of the diﬀerence s − t of the parameters representing
p and q. An example for a curve of this kind is a circle, say, x2 + y2 = 1, in R2. Fixing
some small arc of the circle, the distance between a pair of points p = eit and q = eis is
determined by |t − s| (namely, kp − qk = 2 sin(|t − s|/2)).

The second kind of curves are those that are “very diﬀerent” from a line. One property
that distinguishes such curves from lines is given in Lemma 2.7(i). As a consequence of our
results, one can specify other properties that distinguish curves γ of the latter kind from
a line. For example, no triangle with vertices supported by γ can be moved along γ while
preserving its edge lengths (a posteriori this follows from the results of Charalambides [2],
but we had to deduce this fact independently in order to show that this indeed characterizes
curves of the second kind).

1By a d-dimensional variety V ⊂ RD we mean here that V = VC ∩ RD, where VC is a d-dimensional

algebraic variety in CD which is the zero set of a system of exactly D − d polynomials of real coeﬃcients.

2In fact, instead of distances one may consider any other constant-degree polynomial function over (R2)2.

3

The diﬀerence between Lemma 2.7 and the result in [13] (see Lemma 2.4 for the relevant
statement), is that the latter result, adapted to our context, is restricted to the “bipartite
case”, where one places a set of point P on some small arc of a curve γ, and another set Q
on some other small arc on γ and consider distances between pairs of points (p, q) ∈ P × Q.
Lemma 2.7 allows one to consider all pairwise distances spanned by a set P .

We view the results in this paper as a new type of applications of the Elekes-Szab´o
theorem. We believe our approach, as well as Lemma 2.7, will be useful in future applications
of this theorem.

2 Preliminary results

2.1 A theorem of Koml´os, Sulyok, and Szemer´edi

A set A = {a1, . . . , an} of positive integers is called B2 (see [9]) if the sums ai + aj are all
distinct. Let Φ(n) denote the maximal size of a B2 set consisting of positive integers not
exceeding n. Erd˝os and Tur´an [9] have shown that Φ(n) = Θ(n1/2). Koml´os, Sulyok, and
Szemer´edi [11] have shown that every set of n positive integers (not necessarily {1, . . . , n})
contains a subset of size at least cΦ(n) which is B2, for some constant c > 0.

We show that the result in [11] can be extended to sets of positive real numbers (not

necessarily integers).3

Lemma 2.1. Let X be a set of n positive real numbers. Then there exists a subset Y ⊂ X
of size Ω(n1/2) which is B2.

For the proof of Lemma 2.1 we adapt some of the lemmas that appear in [11], in order
to reduce the problem of ﬁnding B2 subsets in sets of reals, to ﬁnding B2 subsets in sets of
integers. We then apply the results of [9, 11].

Lemma 2.2. Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of n positive real numbers. Suppose that we can
write xi = kiq + ri, such that q > 0 is an integer, |ri| < |q/4| (where ri is a real number),
ki ∈ N, and ki 6= kj, for every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n. If {k1, . . . , kn} is B2, then X is also B2.

Proof. We claim that xi1 + xi2 = xi3 + xi4 implies that also ki1 + ki2 = ki3 + ki4, for every
distinct 1 ≤ i1, i2, i3, i4 ≤ n. Indeed,

xi1 + xi2 = xi3 + xi4

if and only if

if and only if

which implies

ki1q + ri1 + ki2q + ri2 = ki3q + ri3 + ki4q + ri4,

(ki1 + ki2 − ki3 − ki4)q = −ri1 − ri2 + ri3 + ri4,

|(ki1 + ki2 − ki3 − ki4)q| = |ri2 + ri1 − ri3 − ri4| < q,

3This fact is also mentioned in [4] without a proof. Since we use this fact in our analysis, and for

completeness, we provide a proof.

4

where the last inequality follows by our assumption that |rij| < q/4, for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Thus,

0 ≤ |ki1 + ki2 − ki3 − ki4| < 1.
Since ki1, ki2 , ki3, ki4 are integers, by assumption, this implies

ki1 + ki2 = ki3 + ki4.

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Lemma 2.3. Let X be a set of n real positive numbers. Then there exist q, x0 > 0, and a
subset X ′ ⊂ X of size at least n/4, such that (i) every x ∈ X ′ can be written in the form
x + x0 = kxq + rx, for some integer kx ∈ N and with |rx| < q/4, and (ii) kx 6= ky, for every
x 6= y ∈ X ′.
Proof. For any ﬁxed q, consider the partition of the real line R into the union of the semi-
open intervals [ kq
), for k ∈ Z. Clearly, by choosing q > 0 suﬃciently small, we may
assume that each such interval contains at most a single point of X. Thus, for any such
choice of q, and writing x = kxq + rx with kx ∈ N and 0 ≤ rx < q, we get that each number
kx, with x ∈ X, can appear at most four times, at most once for each of the subintervals
[ kxq
4 + iq
), i = 0, 1, 2, 3. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist a subset
4 , (i0+1)q
X ′ ⊂ X of size at least n/4, and an integer i0 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, such that rx ∈ [ i0q
),
It follows that the numbers kx, for x ∈ X ′, are all distinct. Letting
for every x ∈ X ′.
x0 := (4−i0)q

(which is nonnegative), the lemma follows.

Proof of Lemma 2.1. Let q, x0 > 0 and X ′ ⊂ X be the parameters and subset given by
Lemma 2.3. Put

K := {kx | x + x0 = kxq + rx, 0 ≤ rx < q/4, and x ∈ X ′}.

So K is a set of (at least) n/4 positive integers, and thus, by Koml´os, Sulyok, and Sze-
mer´edi [11], it contains a subset K ′ ⊂ K of size Ω(n1/2) which is B2.

By replacing X with the shifted set X + x0 := {x + x0 | x ∈ X}, we may assume that
x0 = 0 (clearly, for any subset Y + x0 ⊂ X + x0 which is B2, the set Y ⊂ X is also B2 and
of the same size). By Lemma 2.2, the subset Y ⊂ X ′, given by Y = {kxq + rx | kx ∈ K ′},
is B2. Since |Y | = |K ′| = Ω(n1/2), this completes the proof of the lemma.

2.2 Distances between points lying on an algebraic curve

The results in this section essentially follow from the analysis in Raz, Sharir, and De
Zeeuw [13]. The main new observation here is in our formulation of Lemma 2.5.4

Lemma 2.4 (Raz, Sharir, and De Zeeuw [13]). Let F ∈ R[x, y, z] be a constant-degree
irreducible polynomial, and assume that none of the derivatives Fx, Fy, Fz is identically

4The results in [13] characterize bivariate functions with certain properties as having the form f (x, y) =
h(ϕ(x) + ψ(y)), over some domains x ∈ I and y ∈ J. Here it is important for us to have x and y ranging
over the same domain I, shared by both.

zero. Then one of the following two statements holds.
(I) For all A, B ⊂ R, with |A| = |B| = n, we have

|{(a, a′, b, b′) ∈ A × A × B × B | ∃c ∈ R. F (a, b, c) = F (a′, b′, c) = 0}| = O(n8/3).

(II) There exists a one-dimensional subvariety Z0 ⊂ Z(F ), such that for all v ∈ Z(F ) \ Z0,
there exist open intervals I1, I2, I3 ⊂ R and one-to-one real-analytic functions ϕi : Ii → R
with analytic inverses, for i = 1, 2, 3, such that v ∈ I1×I2×I3 and for all (x, y, z) ∈ I1×I2×I3

(x, y, z) ∈ Z(F )

if and only if ϕ1(x) + ϕ2(y) + ϕ3(z) = 0

Let γ be a constant-degree irreducible algebraic curve in RD, and let α(t) = (t, α2(t), . . . , αD(t)),

t ∈ (0, 1), be a real-analytic parametrization of some (relatively open connected) arc α ⊂ γ.

which is the squared distance between the two points on α parameterized by x and y. Let ρi
denote the derivative of the function ρ with respect to its ith variable, for i = 1, 2. Consider
the transformation T : (0, 1)4 → R4, given by

T (x, x′, y, y′) := (ρ(x, y), ρ(x, y′), ρ(x′, y), ρ(x′, y′)).

Let JT stand for the Jacobian matrix of T .

Lemma 2.5. Let γ, α, ρ, and T be as above. Assume that det JT = 0 over (0, 1)4. Then
there exists an open sub-interval I ⊂ (0, 1), such that, for every x, y ∈ I,

ρ(x, y) = h(ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)),

where ϕ, h are some univariate invertible analytic functions deﬁned over I and J := ϕ(I)−
ϕ(I), respectively.

For the proof we need the following technical lemma.

Lemma 2.6. Let γ, α, and ρ be as above. Then either γ is a line, or there exist a′, b′ ∈ (0, 1)
and a ﬁnite subset I0 ⊂ (0, 1) (of size depending on the degree of γ), such that

ρ2(x, b′)ρ2(a′, y)ρ1(a′, b′)ρ1(x, b′)ρ1(a′, y)ρ2(a′, b′) 6= 0,

for every x, y ∈ (0, 1) \ I0.

Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that D is minimal, i.e., that γ is not contained
in any hyperplane in RD. If D = 1, then γ is a line, and we are done. Otherwise, we have

i(a′)(αi(a′) − ξi) = 0.

By our assumption, γ is not contained in H, and hence must intersect it in at most a
constant number of points.

Similarly, the zero set

is given by

D

a′ − y +

i(y)(αi(a′) − αi(y)) = 0,

Note that if (1) holds identically for every y in some open subinterval of J ⊂ (0, 1), then
ρ(a′, y) = c, for some constant c > 0 and for every y ∈ (0, 1). This would imply that γ is
contained in the (d − 1)-dimensional sphere of radius c centered at α(a′) (recall that γ is
irreducible). However, since we assume α(a′) ∈ γ, this leads to a contradiction. Thus H ′
does not contain any portion of α.

Note also that, since γ is an algebraic curve, the squared distance between two points
in RD is a polynomial function in the coordinates of (RD)2, and using the implicit function
theorem to obtain a polynomial expression for the derivative ρ2, H ′ is contained in some
constant-degree (depending on the degree of γ) irreducible algebraic variety V . Since H ′
does not contain any portion of α, it must intersect it in at most a constant number of
points (that depends on the degree of γ).

Deﬁne I(a′) ⊂ (0, 1) to be the ﬁnite set of parameters representing α ∩ (H ∪ H ′), if any

exist.

Next, ﬁx some y = b′ ∈ (0, 1) \ I(a′). Then

ρ1(a′, b′)ρ2(a′, b′) 6= 0,

and, applying a symmetric argument to the one given above, there exists a ﬁnite set I(b′) ⊂
(0, 1) such that

for every x ∈ (0, 1) \ I(b′). Letting I0 := I(a′) ∪ I(b′), this completes the proof of the
lemma.

ρ1(x, b′)ρ2(x, b′) 6= 0,

Proof of Lemma 2.5. If γ is a line the assertion is trivial. We may therefore assume this is
not the case. By assumption, we have

ρ1(x, y)ρ2(x, y′)ρ2(x′, y)ρ1(x′, y′) = ρ2(x, y)ρ1(x, y′)ρ1(x′, y)ρ2(x′, y′),

(2)

for every (x, x′, y, y′) ∈ (0, 1)4.

every (x, y) ∈ I 2,

By Lemma 2.6, there exist a′, b′ ∈ (0, 1) and an open interval I ⊂ (0, 1), such that, for

ρ2(x, b′)ρ2(a′, y)ρ1(a′, b′)ρ1(x, b′)ρ1(a′, y)ρ2(a′, b′) 6= 0

(3)

7

and, in view of (2),

ρ1(x, y)ρ2(x, b′)ρ2(a′, y)ρ1(a′, b′) = ρ2(x, y)ρ1(x, b′)ρ1(a′, y)ρ2(a′, b′),

(4)

for every (x, y) ∈ I 2.

Rearranging (4), we have

ρ1(x, y)
ρ2(x, y)

=

p(x)
q(y)

,

(5)

where

p(x) :=

ρ1(x, b′)ρ2(a′, b′)

ρ2(x, b′)

and q(y) :=

ρ2(a′, y)ρ1(a′, b′)

ρ1(a′, y)

,

and each of them is well deﬁned and nonzero on I. We consider the real-analytic primitives
ϕ, ψ so that ϕ′(x) = p(x) on I and ψ′(y) = q(y) on I. Since, by construction, ϕ′, ψ′ are
nonzero, the inverse mapping theorem implies that each of ϕ, ψ has an analytic inverse on
its image.

We repeat the analysis in [13, Lemma 3.17] to show that the diﬀerential equation (5) im-
poses a restrictive form on ρ(x, y). Express the function ρ(x, y) in terms of new coordinates
(ξ, η), given by

ξ = ϕ(x) + ψ(y),

η = ϕ(x) − ψ(y).

(6)

Since each of ϕ, ψ is an injection in I, the system (6) is invertible in I 2. Returning to the
standard notation, denoting partial derivatives by variable subscripts, we have

ξx = ϕ′(x),

ξy = ψ′(y),

ηx = ϕ′(x),

and ηy = −ψ′(y).

Using the chain rule, we obtain

ρ1 = ρξξx + ρηηx = ϕ′(x)(ρξ + ρη) = p(x)(ρξ + ρη)

ρ2 = ρξξy + ρηηy = ψ′(y)(ρξ − ρη) = q(y)(ρξ − ρη),

which gives

ρ1(x, y)
p(x) −
on I 2. Combining this with (5), we get

ρ2(x, y)
q(y) ≡ 2ρη(x, y),

This means that ρ depends (locally in I 2) only on the variable ξ, so it has the form

ρη(x, y) ≡ 0.

ρ(x, y) = h(ϕ(x) + ψ(y)),

for a suitable analytic function h. The analyticity of h is an easy consequence of the
analyticity of ϕ, ψ, and ρ, and the fact that ϕ′(x) and ψ′(y) are nonzero, combined with
repeated applications of the chain rule (see also [13]). Let

J := {ϕ(x) + ψ(y) | (x, y) ∈ I 2}

and T := {h(z) | z ∈ J}.

We observe that

ρ1(x, y) = h′(ϕ(x) + ψ(y)) · ϕ′(x).

8

As argued above, we have ρ1(x, y) 6= 0 for all (x, y) ∈ I 2, implying that h′(ϕ(x) + ψ(y))
is nonzero for (x, y) ∈ I 2. Therefore, by the inverse mapping theorem, h : J → T is
invertible. In particular, the equation h(c) = 0 has a unique solution c0 over J (c0 exists
since ρ(x, x) = 0 for each x ∈ I, implying that 0 ∈ T ).

Finally, since ρ(x, x) = 0, for every x ∈ I, we must have ψ(x) ≡ −ϕ(x) + c0 over I.

Replacing h by ˜h(z) = h(z + c0), z ∈ I, the lemma follows (for ˜h and ϕ).

We obtain the following analogue of Lemma 2.4.

Lemma 2.7. Let γ, α, and ρ be as above. Then one of the following holds.
(i) For every ﬁnite set A ⊂ (0, 1) of size n,

|{(x, x′, y, y′) ∈ A4 | ρ(x, y) = ρ(x′, y′)}| = O(n8/3).

(ii) There exists an open sub-interval I ⊂ (0, 1), such that, for every x, y ∈ I,

ρ(x, y) = h(ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)),

where ϕ, h are some univariate invertible analytic functions deﬁned over I and J := ϕ(I)−
ϕ(I), respectively.

Proof. Suppose that γ ⊂ RD is given by the system

gi(x1, . . . , xD) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , (D − 1),

where each gi is an irreducible constant-degree D-variate real polynomial.5 For every pair
of points x = (x1, . . . , xD), y = (y1, . . . , yD) ∈ γ of distance δ1/2, with δ ≥ 0, we have

gi(x) = 0,
gi(y) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , (D − 1),
i = 1, . . . , (D − 1),

kx − yk2 − δ = (x1 − y1)2 + ··· + (xD − yD)2 − δ = 0.

The system (7) deﬁnes a two-dimensional variety V in R2D+1. Indeed, given a point
x ∈ γ and a parameter δ ≥ 0, there exists at most O(1) points y ∈ γ such that kx− yk2 = δ
(note that it is impossible for γ to be contained in a sphere of radius δ1/2 centered at x,
since x ∈ γ). So locally V can be described (analytically) by two parameters.

We apply a projection π : R2D+1 → R3 onto the coordinates x1, y1, δ of R2D+1. By
applying (in advance) a generic isometry in RD, we may assume that the pre-image of each
of the elements of π(V ) is ﬁnite. Indeed, applying such generic isometry, we may assume
that γ is not contained in a hyperplane of the form {x = (x1, . . . , xD) ∈ RD | x1 = a}, for
some constant a ∈ R. So γ intersects such hyperplane in at most O(1) points.

By construction, we have

Zα := {(x, y, ρ(x, y)) | (x, y) ∈ (0, 1)} ⊂ π(V ).

Since Zα is a graph of a bivariate analytic function (hence, forms a two-dimensional mani-
fold), and it is contained in a two-dimensional algebraic variety (namely, the Zariski-closure

5Note that by a curve γ ⊂ RD, we mean that γ = γC ∩ RD, where γC is a one-dimensional (irreducible)

algebraic curve in CD which is the zero set of a system of exactly D − 1 polynomials of real coeﬃcients.

of π(V )), it follows that Zα ⊂ Z(F ), where F is some irreducible trivariate real polynomial,
and Z(F ) stands the zero set of F . Note that Z(F ) ⊂ π(V ) ∪ Z ′
0 is an algebraic
variety in R3 which is at most one-dimensional.

0, where Z ′

Finally, we apply Lemma 2.4 to the polynomial F . Assume ﬁrst that property (I) of

Lemma 2.4 holds. Then, for every A ⊂ (0, 1), with |A| = n, we have

|{(a, a′, b, b′) ∈ A4 | ∃c ∈ R. F (a, b, c) = F (a′, b′, c) = 0}| = O(n8/3).

(8)

By construction, Z(F ) identiﬁes with the graph of the function ρ over (0, 1)2. Thus (8)
becomes

|{(a, a′, b, b′) ∈ A4 | ∃c ∈ R. ρ(a, b) − c = ρ(a′, b′) − c = 0}| = O(n8/3),

or

and so property (i) of Lemma 2.7 follows for this case.

|{(a, a′, b, b′) ∈ A4 | ρ(a, b) = ρ(a′, b′)}| = O(n8/3),

Assume next that property (II) of Lemma 2.4 holds for the polynomial F . Since Z0 ∪ Z ′
0
is at most one-dimensional, where Z0 is the excluded set given in property (II), there exists
v = (x0, y0, δ0) ∈ N ⊂ Zα \ (Z0 ∪ Z ′
0), where N is some open neighborhood of v in Zα.
By property (II), there exist open intervals I1, I2 ⊂ (0, 1) containing x0, y0, respectively,
and some neighborhood I3 of δ0, and one-to-one real-analytic functions ϕi : Ii → R with
analytic inverses, for i = 1, 2, 3, such that

(x, y, δ) ∈ Z(F )

if and only if

δ = ϕ−1

3 (ϕ1(x) + ϕ2(y)),

for every (x, y, δ) ∈ I1 × I2 × I3. Equivalently, assuming that I1 × I2 × I3 ⊂ N (by possibly
shrinking them, if needed),

ρ(x, y) = δ

if and only if

δ = ϕ−1

3 (ϕ1(x) + ϕ2(y)),

for every (x, y, δ) ∈ I1 × I2 × I3, or

ρ(x, y) = ϕ−1

3 (ϕ1(x) + ϕ2(y)),

for every (x, y) ∈ I1 × I2.

Observe that in case that the last identity holds, we get
det JT = ρ1(x, y)ρ2(x, y′)ρ2(x′, y)ρ1(x′, y′) − ρ2(x, y)ρ1(x, y′)ρ1(x′, y)ρ2(x′, y′) = 0

for every (x, y) ∈ I1 × I1 × I2 × I2. Since T is analytic, this implies that det JT = 0
identically over (0, 1)4. Applying Lemma 2.5, we get that property (ii) holds for this case.
This completes the proof of the lemma.

3 Distinct distances spanned by point sets lying on an alge-

braic curve

3.1 Proof of Theorem 1.2

Let γ be a constant-degree algebraic curve in RD, and let P be a set of n points on γ. Since
γ has constant degree, Ω(n) of the points of P lie on some connected arc α ⊂ γ, that has

10

a parameterization of the form α(t) = (α1(t), α2(t), . . . , αD(t)), for t ∈ (0, 1), where the αi
are analytic. Thus, we may assume, without loss of generality, that P ⊂ α. By applying
(in advance) an isometry of RD, if needed, we may further assume that α1(t) = t in this
parameterization. Letting A := {t ∈ (0, 1) | α(t) ∈ P}, we get that |A| = |P| = n, and
elements of A correspond injectively to points of P .

Apply Lemma 2.7 to γ, α, ρ, where ρ : (0, 1)2 → R is deﬁned as above. Then one of the

properties (i) or (ii) in Lemma 2.7 holds.

Suppose ﬁrst that property (i) holds. Let ∆ denote the set of (squared) distances

spanned by P . We have

(cid:18)n
2(cid:19) = Xδ∈∆(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)(x, y) ∈ A2 | ρ(x, y) = δ(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12)
≤ |∆|1/2 Xδ∈∆(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)(x, x′, y, y′) ∈ A4 | ρ(x, y) = ρ(x′, y′) = δ(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12)!1/2
≤ |∆|1/2(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)(x, x′, y, y′) ∈ A4 | ρ(x, y) = ρ(x′, y′)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:17)1/2
= O(cid:16)|∆|1/2n4/3(cid:17) ,

where the inequality on the second line is due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and for
the last line we used property (i). Rearranging, we get

which completes the proof for this case.

|∆| = Ω(n4/3),

Suppose next that property (ii) holds. Then there exists an open interval I ⊂ (0, 1), such
that ρ(x, y) = h(ϕ(x) − ϕ(y)), for every x, y ∈ I, where ϕ, h are some univariate invertible
analytic functions deﬁned over I, J := ϕ(I) − ϕ(I), respectively.

Consider the transformation S : I 3 → R deﬁned as

S3(x, y, z) := (ρ(x, y), ρ(y, z), ρ(x, z)).

That is, S maps a triple (x, y, z), which is associated with a triple of points p := α(x), q :=
α(y), r := α(z) on α, to the squared lengths of the edges of the triangle pqr spanned by
this triple. It can be easily checked that the restrictive form of ρ, given by property (ii)
in Lemma 2.7, implies that det JS = 0, for every (x, y, z) ∈ I 3. Hence, for every (a, b, c) =
(ρ(x0, y0), ρ(y0, z0), ρ(x0, z0)) in the image of S, the pre-image S−1(a, b, c) is at least one-
dimensional, and can be interpreted as an (at least) one-dimensional family of triangles
pqr with vertices lying on γ and with (squared) edge lengths a, b, c. By Charalambides [2,
Corollary 7.3], this implies that γ is an algebraic helix.

In more detail, it is shown in [2, Lemma 7.1] that the fact that every triangle can be
moved along the arc α (in the above sense) while preserving its edge lengths implies that
any vertex embedding of any complete graph into α can be moved (i.e., every set of n points
on α can be moved continuously along α, so that the pairwise distances between the points
remain ﬁxed). This is then used [2, Lemma 7.3] to show that, assuming our parameterization
α is of unit-speed, the norm kα(k)(t)k of the kth derivative of α is constant, for every k ≥ 1.

11

A result of D’Angelo and Tyson [5, Corollary 3.8] then implies that γ is a generalized helix
(see [2] for the deﬁnition), which is then, since our γ is algebraic, is shown to be an algebraic
helix [2, Lemma 7.4]. This completes the proof.

4 Distinct distance subsets

4.1 Distinct distance subsets on algebraic curves

For the proof of Theorem 1.3 we use the same inductive argument over the dimension d,
used by Conlon et al. [4] (the relevant theorem is cited here as Lemma 4.2). The new
ingredient in our proof is the following bound on the quantity h2,1,r, which is the case d = 1
in Theorem 1.3. This will form the base case for the induction, and will allow us to improve
the general bound. One can view Theorem 4.1 as an extension of the result of Koml´os,
Sulyok, and Szemer´edi [11] (see Lemma 2.1) to general algebraic curves, instead of the real
line.

Theorem 4.1. For every r ≥ 1, we have

where the constant of proportionality depends on r.

h2,1,r(n) = Ω(cid:16)n

4

9(cid:17) ,

Proof. Let γ be a constant-degree irreducible algebraic curve in RD, and let P be a set of n
points on γ. Since γ has constant degree, Ω(n) of the points of P lie in some connected arc
α ⊂ γ, that has a parameterization of the form α(t) = (t, α2(t), . . . , αD(t)), for t ∈ (0, 1).
Thus, we may assume, without loss of generality, that P ⊂ α. Let A := {t ∈ (0, 1) | α(t) ∈
P}. Then |A| = |P| = n, and elements of A correspond injectively to points of P .

As in Section 2, we deﬁne

ρ(x, y) := (x − y)2 +

D

Xi=2

(αi(x) − αi(y))2,

which is the squared distance between the two points on α parameterized by x and y, and
the transformation T : (0, 1)4 → R4, given by

T (x, x′, y, y′) := (ρ(x, y), ρ(x, y′), ρ(x′, y), ρ(x′, y′)).

Assume ﬁrst that det JT = 0 over (0, 1)4. By Lemma 2.5, ρ can be written as ρ(x, y) =
h(ϕ(x)− ϕ(y)), for some univariate invertible analytic functions h, ϕ. Applying Lemma 2.1
to the image set ϕ(A), and using the invertibility of h and of ϕ, we conclude that, in this
case, there exists a subset A′ ⊂ A of size Ω(n1/2), such that all the nonzero values ρ(x, y),
with x, y ∈ A′, are distinct.

Assume next that det JT is not identically zero over (0, 1)4. By Lemma 2.7, we have

|Q| = O(n8/3), where

Q = Q(A) := {(x, x′, y, y′) ∈ A4 | ρ(x, y) = ρ(x′, y′)}.

12

Let

S(A) := {(x, y, y′) ∈ A3 | ρ(x, y) = ρ(x, y′)}.

Note that since γ is irreducible and constant-degree, for every p ∈ γ, a circle centered at p,
for some point p ∈ γ, intersects γ in at most O(1) points, and thus contains O(1) points of
P . Thus, |S(A)| = O(n2).

We now apply a probabilistic argument similar to the one used in [3]. We take a random
subset A0 ⊂ A, such that each point x of A is chosen in A0 independently, with probability
π. Let Q(A0) and S(A0) be as above. We remove one point from each quadruple in Q(A0)
and one point from each triple in S(A0), and let A′ ⊂ A0 be the resulting set. Then, by
construction, the distances spanned by A′ are pairwise distinct.

We claim that for some choice of A0, the set A′ is large enough. Indeed,

E(|A′|) = E(|A0|) − E(|Q(A0)|) − E(|S(A0)|)

for some constants C1, C2 > 0. Choosing π ≥ C

n5/9 , with C > 0 suﬃciently small, we get

E(|A′|) ≥ πn − π4C1n8/3 − π3C2n2,

E(|A′|) ≥ (C − C1C 4)n4/9 − C2C 3n1/3 = Ω(n4/9).

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.

4.2 Proof of Theorem 1.3

Let Ha,d,r(t) be the inverse function of ha,d,r(n). More precisely, Ha,d,r(t) is the minimum n
such that any set of n points, that lie on some d-dimensional irreducible variety V of degree

a are distinct. Conlon et al. [4] proved the following relation.

r, contains a subset of t points for which all the non-zero volumes of the (cid:0)t
a(cid:1) subsets of size
Lemma 4.2 (Conlon et al. [4]). For all integers r, d ≥ 1 and a ≥ 2, there exist positive
integers r′ and j such that, for all integers t ≥ a,

Ha,d,r(t) ≤ 4jHa,d−1,r′(t)t2a−1.

(9)

Lemma 4.2 implies that

H2,d,r(t) ≤ 4H2,d−1,r(t)t3 ≤ 4d−1H2,1,r(t)t3(d−1).

By Theorem 4.1, we have

H2,1,r(t) ≤ t9/4.
Combining the two inequalities Theorem 1.3 follows.
