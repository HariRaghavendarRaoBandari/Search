Negative magnetoresistance in Poiseuille ﬂow of two-dimensional electrons

Ioﬀe Physical Technical Institute, 194021 St. Petersburg, Russia

P. S. Alekseev∗

At low temperatures, in very clean two-dimensional (2D) samples the electron mean free path for
collisions with static defects and phonons becomes greater than the sample width w. At the same
time, the mean free path for electron-electron collisions might be much less than w. Under such
the conditions the electron transport can be described as a Poiseuille ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid and the
sample resistance is determined by the electron viscosity. We calculate the viscosity coeﬃcients for
2D electrons in magnetic ﬁeld. We show that the decrease of viscosity in magnetic ﬁeld provides a
previously unknown mechanism for negative magnetoresistance of 2D electrons which is temperature-
and size-dependent. This mechanism is likely responsible for giant negative magnetoresistance
recently observed in the ultra-high mobility GaAs quantum wells.

1.

In modern high quality heterostructure samples
with low-temperature mobilities of 2D electrons of the
order of 106 − 107 cm2/V·s the electron mean free path
for collisions with static defects and phonons, l, can be
greater than the sample width w. In this case, the trans-
port properties depend on the character of electron scat-
tering at the sample edges. If the scattering is specular
and the sample has the form of a long rectangle, then,
after several collisions with the edges, an electron will
eventually be scattered by a defect or a phonon. These
processes will determine the resistivity

̺ =

τ =

vF

,

(1)

similar to the usual case when l ≪ w. Here n is the
electron concentration, e and m are the electron charge
and the eﬀective mass, and vF is the Fermi velocity.

In this Letter we will be interested in the situation
when l ≫ w and the scattering of electrons on the sam-
ple edges is eﬀectively diﬀusive (this implies the rough
edges or/and a complex geometry of the edges). Then
the electron transport will depend on the relation be-
tween the mean free path for electron-electron collisions,
lee, and the sample width w. When lee is greater than w,
the scattering at the edges dominates and the transport
mean free path will be of the order of w. The correspond-
ing “ballistic” resistivity is:

̺ =

m

e2nτball

,

τball ∼

w
vF

.

(2)

In the opposite case,
lee ≪ w, which we will con-
sider here, the electron transport should resemble the
Poiseuille ﬂow in conventional hydrodynamics with the
resistance proportional to the electron shear viscosity η ∼
vF lee. This idea was put forward (for three-dimensional
conductors) by R. N. Gurzhi with coauthors a long time
ago [1–3], more recently it was also applied to various
aspects of two-dimensional electron transport [4–9].

If the sample is placed in magnetic ﬁeld and the elec-
tron cyclotron radius Rc is far smaller than the sample

width w, the hydrodynamic approach is applicable even
when lee > w (but herewith lee ≪ l) [2].
Indeed, an
electron moving along the trajectory similar to the circle
with the radius Rc ≪ w does not scatter on the sample
edges, but herewith undergoes all other types of scatter-
ing. The electron viscosity, like other kinetic coeﬃcients
(e. g., conductivity), becomes a tensor depending on
magnetic ﬁeld [10].

Another type of systems with the hydrodynamic mech-
anism of the electron transport was studied in Ref. [11].
The authors of that paper considered a 2D viscous ﬂow
bypassing the defects located one from another at the
distances of the order of d, d ≫ lee. Such the defects can
be treated as elements of the composite border of the
2D electron reservoir. If the electron-electron scattering
dominates, the viscous ﬂow in the regions between the
defects is formed and the sample resistivity ̺ is again
proportional to the viscosity η.

The purpose of this work is to develop the hydrody-
namic approach for the two-dimensional electron trans-
port in magnetic ﬁeld [12]. We calculate the electron
viscosity tensor in a shortcut way similar to the text-
book derivation of the Drude conductivity. The diag-
onal viscosity ηxx decreases with magnetic ﬁeld on a
scale deﬁned by the parameter lee/Rc. This provides
a mechanism for negative magnetoresistance of 2D elec-
trons which is temperature- and sample width-dependent
[13]. The non-diagonal viscosity ηxy determines a non-
zero dispersion of the 2D cyclotron waves [14]. We per-
form the exact calculations of magnetoresistance for the
conventional Poiseuille ﬂow in a long rectangular sample
with rough edges. We argue that our theory is qualita-
tively applicable to a wide class of 2D samples with a
complex geometry of edges or/and with a small concen-
tration of large-radius defects [15].

The temperature-dependent giant negative magnetore-
sistance of 2D electrons in high quality GaAs quantum
wells at low temperatures and moderate magnetic ﬁelds,
reported in several recent publications [16–18], and es-
pecially the “colossal” negative magnetoresistance, ob-

served in Ref. [19], are not understood at the present
time. Some striking features of these experiments are
in a ﬁne agreement with our results, as discussed below,
however so far we are not able to provide thorough cal-
culations of all the microscopic parameters used in this
Letter to ﬁt the experimental data.

2. We recall the simple hydrodynamic approach in
the extreme case when the electron mean free path lee is
much less than the 2D sample width w, while the mean
free path for scattering by phonons and static defects is
much greater than w. Also the sample length L is as-
sumed to be much greater than w. The hydrodynamic
electron velocity V (y), directed along x, obeys the equa-
tion:

∂V
∂t

= η

∂2V
∂y2 +

e
m

E ,

(3)

where η = vF lee/4 is the viscosity of the 2D degenerate
electron gas and E is the electric ﬁeld directed along x.
In the present work we neglect the compressibility and
thermal conductivity eﬀects.

The conventional boundary conditions require V = 0
at y = ±w/2 [20]. This conditions imply that relaxation
of the electron momentum occurs only due to the dif-
fusive scattering at the sample edges. Under stationary
conditions, the solution of Eq. (3) gives the parabolic
velocity proﬁle (as for the usual 3D Poiseuille ﬂow):

V (y) =

eE

2mη(cid:16) w2

4

− y2(cid:17) .

(4)

Integrating the current density jx(y) = enV (y) over y
one obtains the total current I and the resistivity ρ =
Ew/I:

ρ =

m
e2nτ ⋆ ,

τ ⋆ =

w2
12η

.

(5)

Here τ ⋆ is the “eﬀective” relaxation time which, in the
hydrodynamic regime, replaces the normal momentum
relaxation time τ [see Eqs. (1) and (5)]. As τ ⋆ =
(w/vF )(w/3lee), we conclude that the viscosity eﬀect
leads to decrease of resistivity compared with the bal-
listic resistivity (2).

Saying precisely, by the electron-electron scattering
time τee = lee/vF we have to imply the relaxation time
τ2,ee of the second moment of the electron distribution
function (i.e., its harmonics ∼ eimφ with m = ±2, where
φ is the angle of the single electron velocity). For such the
time an estimation was done for an ideal Fermi gas and
the Debye model for screening of the Coulomb potential.
We obtained:

(6)

where T is the temperature, EF = mv2
F /2 is the elec-
tron Fermi energy, and Aee is a number of the order of 1.

FIG. 1: The mean free paths l(T ) and l2(T ) for relaxation
of the electron momentum and the second moment of the
electron distribution function. Calculations are performed
by Eqs. (7), (11), (12), and (21) for the sample studied in
Ref. [19]. The dashed line corresponds to the eﬀective width
of the conductive region wef f = 10 µm.

However, in the typical samples the electron-electron in-
teraction energy is of the same order of magnitude as the
electron kinetic energy. For a system of strongly inter-
acting electrons, calculation of the time τ2,ee within the
Fermi-liquid theory is very laborious [21], but it leads
to the result (21), which is quite similar to Eq. (6) (see
Supplemental Material [22]).

Thus the characteristic features of the ideal viscous
electron transport consist in (i) inverse dependence of re-
sistivity on the square of the sample width, ρ ∼ 1/w2,
and (ii) inverse dependence of resistivity on the square
of temperature T , ρ ∼ η ∼ τ2,ee ∼ 1/T 2. A hint on this
very unusual decrease of resistivity with increasing tem-
perature was recently reported in Ref. [19] in a limited
temperature interval below 5 K.

It should be noted that generally the electron viscosity
is not necessarily related to electron-electron collisions.
Any process providing the relaxation of the second mo-
ment of the electron distribution function (e.g., collisions
with phonons [24] or static defects) gives rise to viscos-
ity. Thus, in fact, the viscosity coeﬃcient η contains the
relaxation time τ2, for which

(7)

where 1/τ2,0 is the residual (i.e., existing at T = 0) relax-
ation rate of the second moment of the distribution func-
tion due to electron scattering on static defects (more
generally, on disorder).

The results given by Eq. (5) are modiﬁed if the momen-
tum relaxation time τ due to interaction with phonons
and static defects is comparable to τ ⋆. In this case, the
usual bulk friction term −V /τ should be added to the

right-hand side of Eq. (3):

The modiﬁed velocity proﬁle can be easily found from

pression for the resistivity [2, 3]:

(9)

For τ ≫ τ ⋆, tanh ξ ≈ ξ − ξ3/3 and the expression for the
resistivity in Eq. (9) reduces to Eq. (5). In the opposite
case, when τ ≪ τ ⋆, tanh ξ ≈ 1 ≪ ξ and one recovers
the usual Drude formula (1) for resistivity deﬁned by
the momentum relaxation time τ . It turns out that the
following simple interpolation formula:

ρ =

τ ⋆(cid:17) ,

(10)

reproduces the expression (9) for any value of τ ⋆/τ with
an accuracy better than 11%. Thus the eﬀect of the
electron viscosity can be regarded as a parallel channel
of electron momentum relaxation.

The values of the momentum relaxation time τph for
electron scattering by acoustic phonons were calculated
by using the results of Ref. [23]. According to that paper,
the momentum relaxation rate is proportional to temper-
ature,

1

τph(T )

= AphT ,

(11)

at T & 4 K and to higher powers of temperature at
T . 4 K (for the structure studied in Ref. [19]). We
estimate that our calculations of τph are valid within an
unknown numerical factor, hopefully of the order of 1.
The uncertainty in τph mostly comes from the unknown
exactly form of the quantum well. For the total bulk
momentum relaxation rate we should use the expression:

1

τ (T )

=

1

τph(T )

+

1
τ0

,

(12)

where the term 1/τ0 does not depend on temperature and
is due to electron scattering on disorder.

Fig. 1 shows the calculated temperature dependencies
of the mean free paths l2 = vF τ2 and l = vF τ according
to Eqs. (7), (11), (12), and (21) for the values of the
parameters τ2,0, Aph, τ0, AF l
ee that will be used further in
the text to ﬁt the experimental data from Ref. [19].

3. We now address our main point: the eﬀects re-
sulting from the dependence of the electron viscosity on
magnetic ﬁeld. In Fig. 2 we illustrate the physical origin
of this dependence. We consider that the magnetic ﬁeld
is directed along the normal to the 2D electron layer:
B = Bez. The internal friction between two layers of the

FIG. 2: The physical origin of the decrease of electron viscos-
ity in magnetic ﬁeld (schematics). Two adjacent layers of the
electron ﬂuid are moving with diﬀerent velocities Vx(y1) and
Vx(y2). The viscous friction is due to the interlayer penetra-
tion of electrons. Without magnetic ﬁeld (a) the penetration
length (deﬁning the viscosity) is of the order of l2. In the mag-
netic ﬁeld B = Bez (b) this length is limited by the cyclotron
radius Rc.

electronic ﬂuid moving with diﬀerent velocities is pro-
vided by the exchange of electrons between these layers.
In the absence of magnetic ﬁeld electrons from one layer
penetrate into another one on a distance which is of the
order of l2 and this is what deﬁnes the viscosity. However,
in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld this distance is limited
by the cyclotron radius Rc. Thus at strong magnetic ﬁeld
the viscosity should tend to zero.

We will use the following expressions for the electron
viscosity tensor ηij (to be derived in Supplemental Ma-
terial [22]):

ηxx =

η

1 + (2ωcτ2)2 ,

ηxy =

2ωcτ2η

1 + (2ωcτ2)2 ,

(13)

where ωc = eB/mc is the cyclotron frequency, and η
is the viscosity at zero magnetic ﬁeld introduced above.
Dissipation of energy in a viscous ﬂuid is proportional to
the coeﬃcient ηxx. The coeﬃcient ηxy is not related with
dissipation similarly as it takes place for the oﬀ-diagonal
component σxy of the conductivity tensor.

The formula for ηxx in Eq. (13) was derived by
M. S. Steinberg for a 3D metal in Ref. [24] (with τ2 cor-
responding to relaxation of the second moment of the
distribution function due to the electron-phonon inter-
action). The existence of the non-diagonal viscosity ηxy
as well as the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects in viscous transport
of two-dimensional electrons to our knowledge were not
considered previously.

For a 2D viscous ﬂow in magnetic ﬁeld we derived (see
Supplemental Material [22]) the hydrodynamic equation,

being a generalization of Eq. (8):

∂V
∂t

= ηxx∆V+[ (ηxy∆V+ωcV)×ez ]+

e
m

E−

V

τ

, (14)

where ∆ = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 is the Laplace operator.
The magnetic ﬁeld enters in Eq. (14) not only through
the Lorenz force directly acting on the electron ﬂow, but
also through the viscosity tensor ηij . Since we neglect
compressibility of the electron ﬂuid, we must assume that
divV = 0.

In the stationary regime and in the absence of the Hall

current, Vy ≡ 0, Eq. (14) for a long sample reduces to:

ηxx

ηxy

d2V
dy2 +

Ey = 0 .

(15)

(16)

Here V = Vx, Ex(y) = const is the electric ﬁeld due to
the applied voltage, and Ey(y) is the Hall electric ﬁeld
corresponding to the condition Vy ≡ 0.

Equation (15) coincides with the stationary version of
Eq. (8) if one replaces η by ηxx. Thus, for the case of
the absence of momentum relaxation in the bulk, 1/τ =
0, the resistivity ρ will be given by Eq.
(5) with the
additional factor [1+(2ωcτ2)2]−1, describing the negative
magnetoresistance. For the case of a nonzero rate 1/τ ,
the resistivity ρ is calculated by Eq. (9), where

ξ = r 3τ ⋆

τ

[1 + (2ωcτ2)2] ,

(17)

or by the analog of Eq. (10):

ρ =

m

e2n(cid:16) 1

τ

+

1
τ ⋆

1

1 + (2ωcτ2)2(cid:17) .

(18)

It is seen from Eq. (18) that the decrease of τ2 and fas-
tening of the relaxation rate 1/τ with temperature leads
to broadening and a shift upwards of the magnetoresis-
tance curve. The increase of τ ⋆ with temperature re-
sults in vanishing of negative magnetoresistance. For
high magnetic ﬁelds, ωcτ2 ≫ 1, and low temperatures
Eqs. (11), (12) and (18) yield a ﬁnite value of the re-
sistance, ̺ = m/e2nτ0, which is related with electron
momentum relaxation on disorder in the bulk. All these
features of the behavior of magnetoresistance are seen at
Fig. 3.

We assumed above that the relaxation times τ0 and
τ2,0 do not depend on magnetic ﬁeld. This assumption
is related with the applicability of classical mechanics to
description of electron scattering on disorder. If the type
of disorder implies only the quantum-mechanical treat-
ment of electron kinetics, one should derive the quan-
tum analogs of Eqs. (13) and (14). This may somewhat
change the behavior of magnetoresistance at low temper-
atures.

4

The Hall voltage can be found by integration of
Eq. (16) over y. However, the ﬁrst term in the left-
hand side of Eq. (16), proportional to the viscosity coef-
ﬁcient ηxy, is of the order of ωc(l2/w)2V at ωcτ2 ≪ 1 or
ωc(Rc/w)2V at ωcτ2 ≫ 1, while the second term is far
greater, being of the order of ωcV . Thus in calculation
of the Hall voltage one should take into account only the
second term, and for the Hall coeﬃcient we obtain the
usual result: RH = 1/nec.

The viscosity coeﬃcient ηxy is essential

for non-
stationary ﬂows. For example, as it is seen from Eq. (14),
ηxy determines dispersion of the cyclotron waves, while
ηxx is responsible for their dissipation. Indeed, if we seek
the solution of Eq. (14) in the wave form: Vk(r, t) =
Ak exp( −i ωkt + i k · r), assuming the absence of electric
ﬁeld, E = 0, and bulk momentum relaxation, 1/τ = 0,
than we easily obtain for the dispersion law:

ωk = ±(cid:0)ωc + ηxyk2(cid:1) − iηxxk2 .

(19)

4. We now discuss the recent experimental results on
giant negative magnetoresistance of 2D electrons [16–
19] in the light of our theory. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates
the experimental magnetoresistance curves obtained in
Ref. [19] for an ultra-high quality GaAs sample at diﬀer-
ent temperatures. For the same temperatures and mag-
netic ﬁelds we calculated the magnetoresistance of that
sample within our theory [see Fig. 3(b)]. Herewith we
used the disorder relaxation times τ0, τ2,0 and the am-
plitudes Aph, AF l
ee in the dependencies τph(T ) [Eq. (12)]
and τ2,ee(T ) [Eq. (21)] as ﬁtting parameters.

Although by the appropriate choice of the ﬁtting pa-
rameters we are able to perfectly reproduce the form of
the experimental curves and their evolution with temper-
ature, it is not possible to obtain in such the procedure
the absolute values of resistance observed in the exper-
iments. The only way to reproduce all the features of
Fig. 3(a) within our theory is to replace the sample width
w by some eﬀective width wef f , wef f < w, which can
be treated as the actual width of the conductive regions
in the sample. In Fig. 3(b) we drew magnetoresistance
at diﬀerent temperatures calculated for the following ﬁt-
ting parameters: τ0 = 4.5 · 10−10 s, τ2,0 = 1.1 · 10−11 s,
Aph = 109 s−1·K−1, AF l
ee = 1.3 · 109 s−1·K−2, and
wef f =10 µm. Herewith the condition of applicability
of the hydrodynamic approach, l2 ≪ wef f , is fulﬁlled at
all the temperatures (see Fig. 1). The used values of Aph
and AF l
ee are in agreement by the order of magnitude with
the result of naive estimation of the parameters Aph and
Aee by Eqs. (6) and (11) for an ideal Fermi gas in the
rectangular quantum well, corresponding to one studied
in Ref. [19].

In the samples where the giant negative magnetoresis-
tance eﬀect was observed there always exist the large-
radius oval defects arising in the process of growth of the
heterostructures [25]. The distance d between the defects

varies in the range 20-100µm [25]. If a viscous 2D elec-
tron ﬂuid ﬂows in the sample with such the defects, one
can expect that at the distances of the order of d the pic-
ture of ﬂuid motion is rather similar to the Poiseuille ﬂow
in a long rectangular sample with the width wef f ∼ d.
The details of the velocity ﬁeld V(r) for such the ﬂow
are very complex, but the general relationship:

related with the crucial role of viscosity, will sustain (see
a qualitative proof of this statement in Supplemental Ma-
terial [22]).

We believe that the relative roles of the processes of
diﬀusive scattering of electrons on the sample edges or
bypassing the large-radius defects by the electron ﬂow
signiﬁcantly change from sample to sample, resulting in
a variety of features of the giant negative magnetoresis-
tance eﬀect (see Refs. [16–19]).

5. In conclusion, a viscosity mechanism for negative
magnetoresistance of 2D electrons has been proposed. It
can be characterized by the two main features: (i) spa-
tial inhomogeneity of the electron momentum relaxation
rate [related with scattering on the rough sample edges or
with bypassing the large-radius defects] and (ii) transfer
of the mean electron momentum due to inhomogeneity of
the velocity ﬁeld V(r). The proposed mechanism is likely
responsible for the eﬀect of giant negative magnetoresis-
tance, observed for ultra-high mobility 2D electrons. Our
theory explains the existence of a magnetoresistance peak
as well as its broadening, shift upwards and disappearing
with temperature. However there are some uncertainties
in interpretation of the available experimental data.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

Relaxation times of 2D electrons

For the case of strongly interacting electrons consid-
eration of the viscous transport should be based on the
Fermi-liquid theory. The time τ2,ee should be treated
as the relaxation time of the second moment of the
quasiparticle distribution function due to quasiparticle-
quasiparticle collisions. It must be calculated from the
quantum kinetic equation for the excitations in the 2D
electron Fermi-liquid. In Ref. [21] it was shown that the
dependence 1/τ2,ee(T ), apart from the T 2 factor related
with the Fermi statistics of the quasiparticles, addition-
ally contains the logarithmic factor:

1

τ2,ee(T )

= AF l
ee

T 2

[ln (EF /T )]2 .

(21)

The coeﬃcient AF l
ee is expressed via the Landau inter-
action parameters, which depend on the relative magni-
tudes of the electron-electron interaction energy EC and
the Fermi energy EF . Unfortunately, the Landau param-
eters cannot be found in a closed form as functions of the
interaction parameter rs = EC /EF .

It should be noted that, even for weakly interacting
degenerate 2D electrons, the dependence of the quantum
lifetime τ0,ee due to the electron-electron scattering con-
tains the logarithmic factor [26]:



τ0,ee(T )

= A0
ee

T 2 ln(2EF /T )

EF

,

(22)

where A0
ee is a numeric constant of the order of 1.
Such the behavior of τ2,ee(T ) and τ0,ee(T ) is related
with the special features of kinematics of quasiparticle-
quasiparticle collisions in the 2D case (see Refs. [21, 26]).
The presence of disorder modiﬁes the probability of
electron-electron scattering. Our estimations show that
such the disorder-assisted contribution to the relaxation
rate of the second moment of the distribution function
is quadratic by the temperature [as the result (6) for an
ideal Fermi gas]: 1/τ da
ee T 2. The value of the
coeﬃcient Ada
ee depends on the strength and the type of
disorder.

2,ee = Ada

We assumed in the main text that the relaxation times
τ0 and τ2,0 for electron scattering on disorder do not de-
pend on magnetic ﬁeld. For example, this is the true
for scattering on the isolated static defects if the elec-
tron collisions are described by the classical mechanics
and the cyclotron radius is far greater than the distance
between neighbor defects [27]. However, for many types
of disorder and intervals of magnetic ﬁeld kinetics of 2D
electrons can be treated only in a quantum mechanical
way. As a result, the bulk conductivity tensor even in
non-quantizing magnetic ﬁelds, ωc ≪ T , is not given by

the Drude formulas [28, 29]. In such the case, the hydro-
dynamic equations, similar by its meaning to Eqs. (13)
and (14), should be derived from the quantum kinetic
equation. The magnetic ﬁeld dependencies of the coeﬃ-
cients in the resulting quantum hydrodynamic equation
will be determined by temperature and the type of the
disorder .

Drude-like derivation of the hydrodynamic

equations in magnetic ﬁeld

Here we present a simple derivation of Eqs. (13) for the
electron viscosity tensor ηij in magnetic ﬁeld and Eq. (14)
for the velocity ﬁeld V(r).

The standard method, which takes many pages of la-
borious calculations, is based on the kinetic equation for
the electron distribution function in the presence of the
external ﬁelds E and B and a space-dependent hydrody-
namic velocity V(r) (see, for example, Refs. [10, 24, 30]).
We will use a simplifying shortcut similar to the Drude
approach to the electron transport where the momentum
relaxation time τ is considered as a given parameter. In
our case this given parameter will be the time τ2 of re-
laxation of the second moment of the distribution func-
tion due to electron-electron and disorder scattering. The
only (but important) advantage of the kinetic equation
approach compared to the Drude-like approach is that
the relevant relaxation times as well as the numerical co-
eﬃcients in ηij are calculated on the way.

The viscosity terms in the hydrodynamic equation can
generally be expressed through the viscous stress tensor
(per one particle) Πij = mhvivji, where v = (vx, vy) the
2D velocity of a single electron and the angular brackets
stand for averaging over the electron velocity distribution
at a given point r = (x, y). The motion equation for
the hydrodynamic velocity V = hvi in the absence of
magnetic ﬁeld is:

m

∂Vi
∂t

= −

∂Πij
∂xj

−

mVi

τ

+ eEi .

(23)

Here and below, summation over repeating indices is as-
sumed. At a time scale much greater than the relaxation
time τ2 the expression for Πij is given by [31]:

Πij = Π(0)

ij = −mηVij ,

Vij =

∂Vi
∂xj

+

∂Vj
∂xi

.

(24)

Using Eqs. (23) and (24) and taking into account that the
electronic liquid is considered as incompressible in the
present study (divV = 0), one obtains the basic Eq. (8).
The value given by Eq. (24) is attained during the time
τ2, as described by the Drude-like equation:

∂Πij
∂t

= −

1

τ2(cid:0)Πij − Π(0)
ij (cid:1) .

(25)

In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld, additional terms will
appear in the equations for ∂Vi/∂t and ∂Πi/∂t, since
now the quantities hvii and hvivj i will change in time
not only because of collisions and the electric ﬁeld, but
also due to the action of the magnetic part of the Lorenz
force: (∂vi/∂t)Lf = ωcǫzikvk. Here ǫlik is the unit anti-
symmetric tensor and z is the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld (which is perpendicular to the 2D electron layer).
Thus for the additional terms in the motion equations
one obtains:

(26)

= ωcǫzikhvki ,

(cid:16) ∂hvii
∂t (cid:17)Lf
(cid:16) ∂hvivji
∂t (cid:17)Lf

= ωc(cid:0)ǫzikhvkvji + ǫzjkhvivki(cid:1) .

The terms (26) should be added to the right-hand side
of Eqs. (23) and (25).

Considering the steady-state solution, we get the fol-

lowing relation:

Πij − ωcτ2(cid:0)ǫzikΠkj + ǫzjkΠik(cid:1) = Π(0)

ij ,

allowing to ﬁnd the components of the tensor Πij :

Πxx = −Πyy =

Πxy = −Πyx =

1 + β2 Π(0)

xx +

1 + β2 Π(0)

xy −

β

1 + β2 Π(0)
xy ,

β

1 + β2 Π(0)
xx ,

(27)

(28)

where β = 2ωcτ2. Here we used the relationship Πii = 0,
which follows from divV = 0 and Eq. (27). The viscos-
ity coeﬃcients are deﬁned from the linear relationship
between the tensors Πij and Vij :

Πij = m (ηxxVij + ηxyǫzikVkj ) ,

(29)

which follows from Eqs. (24) and (28).

With the help of Eqs. (23), (26), (28), and the condi-
tion divV = 0 we arrive to Eqs. (13) and (14) that were
used in the main text.

We have checked that the conventional method based
on the classical kinetic equation gives exactly the same
results as this simple derivation.

2D viscous ﬂow in a media with large-radius defects

As an another possible model to describe the magne-
totransport of 2D electrons in the hydrodynamic regime
one can consider a viscous ﬂow bypassing the static de-
fects with the radius r0 and concentration N , N −1/2 ≫
lee. For the case of the absence of magnetic ﬁeld such
the model was discussed in Refs. [11, 32], where for the
resistivity of the 2D viscous ﬂuid it was obtained ̺ ∼ η
for the large-radius defects, r0 ≫ lee, and

̺ ∼

η

ln(cid:16)N −1/2/ lee(cid:17)

(30)

for the small-radius defects, r0 ≪ lee. Up to the logarith-
mic factor, which cannot be very large for real samples,
this result is similar to the formula (5), obtained for the
Poiseuille ﬂow in a long rectangular sample. The exact
consideration of the ﬂow bypassing large-radius defects
in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld must be done on base of
Eq. (14) with the corresponding boundary conditions on
V(r) and E(r) at the edges of the sample and the edges
of the defects. We believe that such the model will again
yield the general relationship (20), which leads to giant
negative magnetoresistance.

Qualitatively, a viscous ﬂow in a sample with large-
radius defects can be considered as follows. Following to
Ref. [33], we introduce the mean values of the velocity V
and the electric ﬁeld E, which are the results of averaging
of the values V(r) and E(r) by a volume with the size
that is far greater than the distance between defects, d =
N −1/2. The result of such averaging of the value ∆V
can be estimated as −V/d2. Here we make use of spatial
homogeneity of the system at the scales much greater
that d and an oscillating character of the dependence
V(r) with the character period of the order of d. Thus
for the ﬂow in a long rectangular sample with the width
w, w ≫ d, Eq. (15) should be replaced by

− ηxx

V x
d2 +

m

Ex −

which immediately leads to the magnetoresistance (18)
and (20). Let us remind here that Eq. (18) is just the
result of mathematical interpolation of the exact formula
(9), obtained for the conventional Poiseuille ﬂow in the
ﬂat sample.

It is noteworthy that for a ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid in
a sample with the large-radius defects the character of
electron scattering (diﬀusive or specular) on the sample
edges and the defect edges is not essential. Generally
speaking, any violation of the ﬂat geometry (defects, a
curved proﬁle of the sample edges) plays the role of the
diﬀusive scattering in forming a viscous ﬂow.

Comparing Eqs. (5) and (31), we conclude that the
time τ ⋆ = d2/ηxx can be interpreted as the non-local
momentum relaxation time due to the viscosity eﬀect. In
other words, the time τ ⋆ characterizes the mean momen-
tum relaxation when there exist separated regions with
high and low rates of electron momentum relaxation and
the diﬀusion of electron momentum occurs between these
regions.
