Homogenization of a stationary ﬂow of a generalized Newtonian

ﬂuid

Miroslav Bul´ıˇcek, Martin Kalousek, Petr Kaplick´y

March 16, 2016

Abstract

We perform the homogenization process avoiding the necessity of testing the weak formulation of the
initial and homogenized systems by corresponding weak solutions. We show that the stress tensor for
homogenized problem depends on the gradient involving the limit of a sequence selected from a family of
solutions of initial problems.

1 Introduction

Electrorheological ﬂuids are special liquids characterized by their ability to change signiﬁcantly the mechan-
ical properties when an electric ﬁeld is applied. This behavior has been extensively investigated for the
development of smart ﬂuids, which are currently exploited in technological applications, e.g. brakes, clutches
or shock absorbers. Results of the ongoing research indicate their possible applications also in electronics.
One approach for modeling of the ﬂow of electrorheological ﬂuids is the utilization of a system of partial
diﬀerential equations derived by Rajagopal and R˚uˇziˇcka, for details see [11]. This system in the case of an
isothermal, homogeneous, incompressible electrorheological ﬂuid reads

∂tu − div S + div(u ⊗ u) + ∇π = f ,

div u = 0,

(1)

where u is the velocity, S the extra stress tensor, div(u ⊗ u) is the convective term with u ⊗ u denoting
the tensor product of the vector u with itself deﬁned as (uiuj)i,j=1,...,n, π is the pressure and f the external
body force. The stress tensor S is assumed to be dependent on the shear rate Du, where Du denotes
the symmetric part of the velocity gradient. Moreover, the presence of an electric ﬁeld is captured by the
supposed dependence of S on the spatial variable and the growth of S corresponds to |Du|p(·)−1 for some
variable exponent p.

For this setting assuming additionally a periodic variable exponent with a small period ε, it was shown
by Zhikov in [16] that as ε → 0 a subsequence of solutions of initial problems converges to a solution of the
homogenized problem having the extra stress tensor independent of the spatial variable. Zhikov’s approach
is based on the fact that the regularity of solutions of the initial as well as homogenized problem allows to
use these solutions as a test function. In fact, this suﬃcient regularity is ensured by the value of the lower
bound for the variable exponent p. This paper should be regarded as the ﬁrst step on the way that leads to
the removal of this requirement.
Let us introduce the problem, which we will deal with. The domain Ω ⊂ Rd is supposed to be bounded and
Lipschitz and we pick ε ∈ (0, 1). We consider the following stationary version of the problem (1)

− div(cid:16)S(cid:16) x

ε

, Duε(cid:17) − uε ⊗ uε(cid:17) + ∇πε = − div F in Ω,

div uε = 0

in Ω,

uε = 0

on ∂Ω,

(2)

ZΩ

πε = 0,

1

where the external body forces are supposed to be given in the divergence form.

For this problem we establish a homogenized problem

− div(cid:16)bS(Du) − u ⊗ u(cid:17) + ∇π = − div F in Ω,

div u = 0

in Ω,

u = 0

on ∂Ω,

ZΩ

π = 0.

(3)

Our eﬀort will be spent on determining the homogenized stress tensor bS. The situation is similar to the

limit passage in the stress tensor in the proof of the existence of weak solutions of generalized Navier-Stokes
equations. However, one cannot straightforwardly adopt methods, which are successfully applied for existence
proofs, because of oscillations, which occur in the spatial variable of the stress tensor. We prove

Theorem 1.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain, p satisfy Assumption 2.1, S satisfy Assump-
tion 2.2 and F ∈ Lβ ′
sym). Let {(uε, πε)} be a family of weak solutions of the system (2) constructed in
Theorem 3.1. Then a subsequence {(uε′

)} can be selected such that as ε′ → 0

(Ω; Rd×d

, πε′

⇀ u in W 1,β

0

(Ω; Rd),

πε′

⇀ π in Ls(Ω),

where s is determined in (12) and (u, π) is a weak solution of the system (3) with ˆS given by (15).

For the sake of clarity, we recall the meaning of diﬀerential operators appearing in the paper. Let us

consider u : Ω × Y → Rd then

∂xj(cid:19)d
∇xu =(cid:18) ∂ui

i,j=1

, divx u =

∂ui

∂yj(cid:19)d
, ∇yu =(cid:18) ∂ui

i,j=1

, divy u =

∂ui
∂yi

.

dXi=1

We omit the subscript if the function depends on the variable from one domain only. Throughout the paper
the identity matrix is denoted by I. The generic constants are denoted by c. When circumstances require it,
we may also include quantities, on which the constant depend, e.g. c(d) for the dependence on the dimension
d. If we want to distinguish between diﬀerent constants in one formula, we utilize subscripts, e.g. c1, c2 etc.

Let M, N be open subsets of Rd. M ⋐ N means that M ⊂ M ⊂ N , M being compact.

2 Preliminaries

Let us denote Y = (0, 1]d. We summarize assumptions on a function p : Rd → [1, ∞]:

Assumption 2.1.

1. p is Y −periodic,

2. there is β > 2d

d+2 such that

1 ≤ p(y) ≤ β, y ∈ Rd.

The tensor S : Rd × Rd×d

sym → Rd×d

sym is deﬁned as

S(y, ξ) = δ|ξ|β−2ξ + A(y, ξ),

where δ > 0 and A is assumed to fulﬁll:

Assumption 2.2.

1. A is Y −periodic in the ﬁrst variable,

2

(4)

(5)

2. for almost all y ∈ Rd : A(y, ·) is continuous,

3. for all ξ ∈ Rd×d

sym : A(·, ξ) is measurable,

4. for ξ1 6= ξ2 (A(y, ξ1) − A(y, ξ2)) · (ξ1 − ξ2) > 0,

5. there are c1, c2 > 0 : A(y, ξ) · ξ ≥ c1|ξ|p(y) − 1, |A(y, ξ)|p′(y) ≤ c2|ξ|p(y) + 1 p′(y) = p(y)

p(y)−1 .

Further, the following function spaces appear.

0 (Ω; Rd) : div u = 0 in Ω(cid:9) ,

per(Y ) = {u ∈ C∞(Rd) : u Y -periodic},

C∞

C∞

0,div(Ω) =(cid:8)u ∈ C∞
D(cid:0)Ω; C∞

per(Y )(cid:1) the space of measurable functions u : Ω × Rd → R such that for any x ∈ Ω u(x, ·) ∈ C∞

and the map x 7→ u(x, ·) is indeﬁnitely diﬀerentiable with compact support in Ω.

per(Y )

We introduce the following subspace of Lβ(Y ; Rd×d

sym) and its annihilator in Lβ(Y ; Rd×d

sym):

Proposition 2.1. We have the following identiﬁcation for the annihilator of the direct sum Rd×d

sym ⊕ G(Y )

G(Y ) =(cid:8)Dw : w ∈ W 1,β
G⊥(Y ) =(cid:26)V∗ ∈ Lβ ′

(Y ; Rd×d

V∗(y) · V(y) dy = 0(cid:27) .

per (Y ; Rd), div w = 0 in Y(cid:9) ,
sym) : ∀V ∈ G(Y ) ZY
=(cid:0)G⊥(Y )(cid:1)0 =(cid:26)V∗ ∈ G⊥;ZY
. By the deﬁnition of the annihilator, V∗ ∈(cid:0)Rd×d

V∗ = 0(cid:27) .

(cid:0)Rd×d
sym ⊕ G(Y )(cid:1)⊥
Proof. Clearly,(cid:0)G⊥(Y )(cid:1)0 ⊂(cid:0)Rd×d
sym ⊕ G(Y )(cid:1)⊥
sym ⊕ G(Y )(cid:1)⊥
sym, V ∈ G(Y ) RY V∗(η + V) = 0. The choice η = 0 implies V∗ ∈ G⊥(Y ) and
setting V = 0, η =RY V∗ we getRY V∗ = 0.

means that for any η ∈ Rd×d

2.1 Lebesgue spaces with variable exponents

Deﬁnition 2.1. We introduce the modular

ρp,Ω(u) =ZΩ

|u(x)|p(x) dx

for u ∈ L1(Ω). The variable exponent Lebesgue space Lp(·)(Ω) is deﬁned as

and endowed with the norm

We have the following result.

Lp(·)(Ω) = {u ∈ L1(Ω) : ρp,Ω(u) < ∞}

kukLp(·)(Ω) = infnλ > 0 : ρp,Ω(cid:16) u

λ(cid:17) ≤ 1o .

Proposition 2.2. Let Ω ⊂ Rd be bounded. Then the embedding Lp(·)(Ω) ֒→ Lq(·)(Ω) holds if and only if
q ≤ p almost everywhere in Ω.

Proof. See [4, Section 3.3].

2.2 Generalized Orlicz and Sobolev-Orlicz spaces

Deﬁnition 2.2. We say that a function ϕ : Rn → R is a generalized N −function if ϕ is convex, even and
is superlinear, i.e.

lim
|ξ|→0
We deﬁne a conjugate function ϕ∗ to ϕ as

ϕ(ξ)
|ξ|

= 0,

lim

|ξ|→∞

ϕ(ξ)
|ξ|

= ∞.

(6)

ϕ∗(ζ) = sup
ξ∈Rn

{ζ · ξ − ϕ(ξ)}.

We say that the generalized N −function ϕ satisﬁes ∆2−condition if there is C > 0 such that for all ξ ∈
Rn ϕ(2ξ) ≤ Cϕ(ξ).
We introduce the modular

ρϕ,Ω(v) =ZΩ

ϕ(v(x)) dx

Lϕ(Ω; Rn) = {v ∈ L1(Ω; Rn) : ρϕ,Ω (v) < ∞},

kvkLϕ(Ω) = infnλ > 0 : ρϕ,Ω(cid:16) v

λ(cid:17) ≤ 1o .

and deﬁne the Orlicz space

endowed with the norm

The notion of generalized N −function was introduced in [12]. In [13], Orlicz spaces generated by such

functions were introduced and their basic properties were studied.

2.3 Auxiliary tools

Lemma 2.1. Let E ⊂ Rd be a bounded domain and {vn} be a sequence of functions bounded in L1(E).
Then there exists a subsequence {vn′
} ⊂ {vn}, a function v ∈ L1(E) and a sequence of measurable sets
{Ej}, E ⊇ E1 ⊇ E2 ⊇ · · · with |Ej| → 0 such that for each j vn′

⇀ v in L1(E \ Ej ).

Proof. See [3].

Theorem 2.1 (Dunford). Let Σ ∈ Rd be a measurable set. A subset M of L1(Σ) is relatively weakly compact
if and only if it is bounded and uniformly integrable, i.e.
for any θ > 0 there is δ > 0 such that for any

f ∈ M and a measurable K ⊂ Σ with |K| < δ we have RK f < θ.

Proof. See [6, Section III.2 Theorem 15].

Lemma 2.3. Let Σ ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain, q ∈ (1, ∞) and denote Lq

0(Σ) → W 1,q

0(Σ) = {h ∈ Lq :
(Σ; Rd) such that div Bh = h for any

RΣ h = 0}. There exists a continuous linear operator B : Lq

h ∈ Lq

0(Σ).

Proof. See [7, Theorem 10.11].

Theorem 2.2. Let Ω ⊂ Rd be open and Φ : Y × Rd×d

sym → R satisfy:

(i) Φ is carath´eodory, i.e. for all ξ ∈ Rd×d

sym Φ(·, ξ) is measurable, for almost all y ∈ Ω Φ(y, ·) is continuous,

4

(ii) for almost all y ∈ Ω Φ(y, ·) is convex,

(iii) Φ ≥ 0.

Then for every Uε, U0 ∈ L1(Ω × Y ; Rd×d

sym) such that Uε ⇀ U in L1(Ω × Y ; Rd×d

sym), we have that

ε→0 ZΩ

Φ (y, Uε(x)) dx ≥ZΩ×Y

Φ(y, U(x, y)) dy dx.

Proof. See [8, Theorem 4.5], where a more general assertion is proved.

Theorem 2.3. Let X be a Banach space, V be a subspace of X, A be a closed convex functional on X and
A be continuous at some x ∈ X. Then

A is said to be closed if for any a ∈ R {x ∈ X : A(x) ≤ a} is closed.

Proof. See [9, Theorem 14.2], where a more general assertion is proved.

Remark 2.1. We observe that if g is a convex functional on a Banach space X and y∗ ∈ X ∗ then

(g − y∗)(x∗) = sup
x∈X

{hx∗ + y∗, xi − g(x)} = g∗(x∗ + y∗).

(7)

Moreover, if g is closed and continuous at some x ∈ X, V is a subspace of X, we obtain combining Theorem
2.3 and (7)

For f ∈ L1(Rd), we deﬁne the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function as

(M f )(x) = sup

|Br(x)|ZBr (x)

|f (y)| dy,

where Br(x) stands for a ball having a center at x and radius r.

Theorem 2.4. Let Ω ⊂ Rd be open and bounded with a Lipschitz boundary and α ≥ 1. Then there is c > 0
such that for any v ∈ W 1,α

(Ω; Rd) and every λ > 0 there is vλ ∈ W 1,∞

(Ω; Rd) satisfying

(9)

Proof. The similar assertion, formulated for functions that do not vanish on ∂Ω, appeared in [1]. For our
purposes we refer to [5, Theorem 2.3], which for any v ∈ W 1,α
(Ω; Rd) and any numbers θ, λ > 0 ensures the
existence of vθ,σ ∈ W 1,∞

(Ω; Rd) such that

0

and up to a set of Lebesgue measure zero

kvθ,σkL∞(Ω) ≤ θ, k∇vθ,σkL∞(Ω) ≤ c(d, Ω)σ

|{vθ,σ 6= v}| ⊂ Ω ∩ ({M (v) > θ} ∪ {M (∇v) > σ}) .

We pick v ∈ W 1,α
conclude (9)1. Moreover, since we have for any f ∈ Lα(Rd) and σ > 0

(Ω; Rd) and λ > 0. We apply [5, Theorem 2.3] with λ,

2.4 Two-scale convergence

The following concept of convergence was introduced by Nguetseng in his seminal paper [10]: a sequence
{uε} bounded in L2(Ω) is said weakly two-scale convergent to u0 ∈ L2(Ω × Y ) if for any smooth function
ψ : Rd × Rd → R, which is Y −periodic in the second argument,

ε→0ZΩ

lim

uε(x)ψ(cid:16)x,

x

ε(cid:17) dx =ZΩ×Y

u0(x, y)ψ(x, y) dx dy.

(10)

Properties of this notion of convergence were investigated and applied to a number of problems, see [2], and
the concept was also extended to Lp, p ≥ 1. It was shown later that there is an alternative approach, so
called periodic unfolding, for the introduction of the weak two-scale convergence, which allows to represent
the two-scale convergence by means of the standard weak convergence in a Lebesgue space on the product
Ω × Y . In the same manner the strong two-scale convergence is introduced. Since it is known that both
presented notions of the weak two-scale convergence are equivalent, see [15], all properties known for the
weak two-scale convergence introduced via (10) hold also for the second approach. We recall the introduction
of the weak two-scale convergence via periodic unfolding.

Deﬁnition 2.3. We deﬁne functions n : R → Z, r : R → [0, 1), N : Rd → Zd and R : Rd → Y as

n(x) = max{n ∈ Z : n ≤ x}, r(x) = x − n(x),

N (x) = (n(x1), . . . , n(xd)), R(x) = x − N (x).

Then we have for any x ∈ Rd, ε > 0, a two-scale decomposition x = ε(cid:0)N(cid:0) x
ε(cid:1)(cid:1). We also deﬁne for
ε(cid:1) + R(cid:0) x
any ε > 0 a two-scale composition function Tε : Rd × Y → Rd as Tε(x, y) = ε(cid:0)N(cid:0) x
ε(cid:1) + y(cid:1).
Remark 2.2. It follows that Tε(x, y) → x uniformly in Rd × Y as ε → 0 since Tε(x, y) = x + ε(cid:0)y − R(cid:0) x
ε(cid:1)(cid:1).

Deﬁnition 2.4. We say that a sequence of functions {vε} ⊂ Lr(Rd)

1. converges to v0 weakly two-scale in Lr(Rd × Y ), vε

2−s−−⇀ v0, if vε ◦ Tε converges to v0 weakly in

Lr(Rd × Y ),

2. converges to v0 strongly two-scale in Lr(Rd × Y ), vε 2−s−−→ v0, if vε ◦ Tε converges to v0 strongly in

Lr(Rd × Y ).

Remark 2.3. We deﬁne two-scale convergence in Lr(Ω × Y ) as two-scale convergence in Lr(Rd × Y ) for
functions extended by zero to Rd \ Ω.

Lemma 2.4. Let g ∈ L1(Rd; Cper(Y )). Then, for any ε > 0, the function (x, y) 7→ g(Tε(x, y), y) is integrable
and

ZRd

g(cid:16)x,

ε(cid:17) dx =ZRdZY

g(Tε(x, y), y) dy dx.

Proof. See [15, Lemma 1.1]

Lemma 2.5.

(i) Let v ∈ Lr(Ω; CperY ), r ∈ [1, ∞), v be Y −periodic then v(cid:0)x, x
(ii) Let vε 2−s−−⇀ v0 in Lr(Ω × Y ) then vε ⇀RY v0(·, y) dy in Lr(Ω).

ε(cid:1) → v(x, y) in Lr(Ω × Y ) as ε → 0.

(iii) Let {vε} be a bounded sequence in Lr(Ω), r ∈ (1, ∞). Then there is v0 ∈ Lr(Ω × Y ) such that, up to a

subsequence, vε 2−s−−⇀ v0 in Lr(Ω × Y ).

(iv) Let Ω be bounded and vε converge weakly to v in W 1,r(Ω), r ∈ (1, ∞). Then there is v0 ∈ Lr(Ω; W 1,r

per(Y ))
such that, up to a subsequences, vε converges strongly to v in Lr(Ω) and ∇vε converges weakly two-scale
to ∇xv + ∇yv0 in Lr(Ω × Y )d.

(v) Let r ∈ [1, ∞) and Φ : Rd × Rd×d

sym → R satisfy:

(a) Φ is carath´eodory,

6

(b) Φ(y, ·) is Y −periodic, for almost all y ∈ Y Φ(y, ·) is convex,

(c) Φ ≥ 0,Φ(·, 0) = 0.

Then

Proof. As

by deﬁnition of Tε and Y −periodicity of v, the r−mean continuity of v and Remark 2.2 imply

We obtain (ii) if functions independent of y-variable are considered in the deﬁnition (10) of the weak con-
vergence in Lr(Ω × Y ). The assertion (iii) is a direct consequence of the weak compactness of bounded sets
in Lr(Ω × Y ) and Deﬁnition 2.4 1. For the proof of (iv) with r = 2 see [2, Proposition 1.14. (i)], the proof
for general r 6= 2 is analogous.

Let us show (v). It follows from Lemma 2.4 and Theorem 2.2, that for Uε, U0 extended by zero in Rd \ Ω

Hence we conclude (v).

3 Existence of weak solutions of the problems (2) and (3)

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let F ∈ Lβ ′

(Ω; Rd×d

sym), S be deﬁned by (5) and ε > 0 be ﬁxed and denote

Let s be determined by

(12)

We say that a pair (uε, πε) ∈ W 1,β
C∞

0 (Ω; Rd)

0,div(Ω; Rd) × Ls(Ω) is a weak solution of the problem (2) if for any w ∈

ZΩ

(Sε − uε ⊗ uε − πεI) : Dw dx =ZΩ

F : Dw.

(13)

Theorem 3.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain, ε > 0 be ﬁxed, F ∈ Lβ ′
sym), Assumption
2.1 and 2.2 be fulﬁlled. Then there exists a weak solution (uε, πε) of (2). Moreover, there is c > 0 independent
of ε such that

(Ω; Rd×d

kDuεkLβ(Ω) ≤ c,

kπεkLs(Ω) ≤ c.

(14)

Proof. Due to assumptions on the function p, namely its boundedness from above by β, we can adopt the
technique used for the proof in [5, Theorem 3.1].

In accordance with [16] the homogenized tensor ˆS : Rd×d

sym → Rd×d

sym is determined by

ˆS(ξ) =ZY

S(y, ξ + V(y)) dy,

(15)

7

where the function V is a solution of the cell problem: Let ξ ∈ Rd×d
for any W ∈ G(Y )

sym be ﬁxed. We seek V ∈ G(Y ) such that

S(y, ξ + V(y))W(y) dy = 0.

(16)

ZY

Since G(Y ) is reﬂexive and the tensor S is strictly monotone, the existence and uniqueness of V follows using
the theory of monotone operators.

Before we show the existence result for the homogenized problem, we investigate a functional f : Rd×d

sym →

R deﬁned as

f (ξ) = min

V∈G(Y )ZY

|ξ + V(y)|β

β

dy.

(17)

We notice that minimum on the right hand side is always attained since a power of the modulus is convex
and continuous and G(Y ) is reﬂexive.

Lemma 3.1.

(i) f is positive for ξ 6= 0, even and convex,

(ii) there are constants c1, c2 > 0 such that c1|ξ|β ≤ f (ξ) ≤ c2|ξ|β,

(iii) f is a generalized N −function,

(iv) f satisﬁes the ∆2−condition.

Proof. First, we realize that by the deﬁnition of G(Y )

G(Y ) ∩ Rd×d

sym = {0}.

(18)

Then the deﬁnition of f implies f (0) = 0. Let us assume, contrary to (i), that f (ξ) = 0 for some ξ 6= 0. Then
we obtain from the deﬁnition of f that V = −ξ for almost all y ∈ Y , which is impossible due to (18). The
fact that f is even immediately follows since G(Y ) is a subspace of Lβ(Y ; Rd×d
sym). When showing convexity
|ξi+Vi|β
of f , we choose ξ1, ξ2 ∈ Rd×d
dy, i = 1, 2. Then for
λ ∈ (0, 1) we have by the deﬁnition of f and due to the convexity of power of the modulus

sym and ﬁnd V1, V2 ∈ G(Y ) such that f (ξi) =RY

β

f (λξ1 + (1 − λ)ξ2) ≤ZY

|λξ1 + (1 − λ)ξ2 + λV1 + (1 − λ)V2|β

β

≤ λf (ξ1) + (1 − λ)f (ξ2),

i.e. f is convex.
Since f is convex, it is locally Lipschitz continuous. Especially it is Lipschitz continuous and therefore
continuous on the unit sphere SRd×d
sym. Hence f attains its minimum value fmin
and maximum value fmax on SRd×d

, which is compact in Rd×d
. We have for ξ 6= 0 that

sym

f (ξ) = min

V∈G(Y )ZY

sym). Hence we realize |ξ|βfmin ≤ f (ξ) ≤ |ξ|βfmax, i.e. we have shown

since G(Y ) is a subspace of Lβ(Y ; Rd×d
(ii).
To verify that f is an N −function it suﬃces to show its superlinear growth which immediately follows from
inequalities in (ii).
To show that f satisﬁes ∆2−condition, we choose ξ ∈ Rd×d
in (17). Then we obtain due to (4)

The reason why we deal with the generalized N −functions f and f ∗ is that they indicate properties of

the homogenized tensor, namely its coerciveness and growth.
Proposition 3.2. There are constants ˆc1, ˆc2 > 0 such that for any ξ ∈ Rd×d
sym

ˆS(ξ) · ξ ≤ ˆc1f (ξ) − 1,

f ∗(ˆS(ξ)) ≤ ˆc2f (ξ) + 1.

Moreover, ˆS is monotone.

Proof. See [16, Proposition 2].

Regarding to the properties of the functionals f, f ∗, it is meaningful to introduce spaces Lf (Ω) and Lf ∗

(Ω)

in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2. Moreover, we deﬁne

W f

0,div(Ω) = {u ∈ W 1,1

0,div(Ω; Rd) : Du ∈ Lf (Ω)}.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let s be determined by (12). We say that a pair (u, π) ∈ W f
solution of the problem (3) if for any w ∈ C∞

0,div(Ω) × Ls(Ω) is a weak

properties listed in Proposition 3.2, W f
0,div(Ω) is compactly embedded into L2(Ω; Rd) due to the assumed
lower bound for β and Lemma 3.1 (ii), which also implies C∞

4 Proof of the main theorem

Lemma 4.1. Let s be given by (12) and the functions uε, πε, Sε, F be extended by zero on Rd \ Ω for ε > 0.
Let functions πε,1 ∈ Lβ ′

β∗
2 (Rd), πε,3 ∈ Lβ ′

(Ω) be deﬁned as

(Rd), πε,2 ∈ L

πε,1 = div div N (Sε) ,

πε,2 = div div N (F + uε ⊗ uε) ,

πε,3 = πε − πε,1 − πε,2.

Here N (Sε) denotes the componentwise Newton potential of Sε. Then

{πε,1} is bounded in Lβ ′

(Rd),

{πε,2} is precompact in Lq(Rd) for any q ∈ [1, s),

{πε,3} is precompact in Lβ ′

(O) for any O ⋐ Ω.

Proof. Applying the theory of Calderon-Zygmund operators, see [4, Section 6.3], yields the estimate

kπε,1kLβ′ (Rd) ≤ ckSεkLβ′ (Rd)

(20)

(21)

and the precompactness of {πε,2} in Lq(Rd), q ∈ [1, s) since {F − uε ⊗ uε} is precompact in Lq(Rd; Rd×d
sym).
It follows that {πε,3} is a sequence of functions, which are harmonic in Ω and bounded in L1(O) for any
O ⋐ Ω. Hence {πε,3} is precompact in Lβ ′

(O).

Lemma 4.2. Let Sε be deﬁned by (11) and πε,1 be deﬁned in Lemma 4.1 for ε > 0. Then there is a sequence
of measurable sets Ω1 ⊂ Ω2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ωn ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ω with |Ω \ Ωn| → 0 such that for any n ∈ N and θ > 0 there
is δ > 0 such that for any ε and K ⊂ Ωn with |K| < δ

kSεkLβ′ (K) + kπε,1kLβ(K) < θ

β .

(22)

Proof. Let us denote gε = |Sε|β ′
. The apriori estimate (14)1, the growth condition on S and (20)1
imply the boundedness of {gε} in L1(Ω). The application of Chacon’s biting lemma 2.1 on {gε} yields the
existence of sets Ωn ⊂ Ω with |Ω \ Ωn| → 0 and the existence of a subsequence gε′
and a function g ∈ L1(Ω)
such that gε′

⇀ g in L1(Ωn). The equiintegrability of gε on Ωn follows according to Dunford theorem 2.1.

Lemma 4.3. Let s be determined by (12), {(uε, πε)} be a family of weak solutions of (2) and {πε,1} be

assumption on growth of S and Lemma 2.5 (iii).

Let us show (27). The convergence (24) means that for any ψ ∈ D(cid:0)Ω; C∞

divy u0(x, y)b(y)a(x).

Hence for a.a. x ∈ Ω divy u(x, ·)0 = 0 a.e. in Y , i.e. we conclude (27).
We show that for any σ ∈ C∞

ε(cid:1) ∇σ(x)(cid:1) that satisﬁes

Hence (34) and thus (28) follow due to an obvious factRY Dyh(y) = 0.
ε→0 ZΩ

|Du(x) + Dyu0(x, y)|β dy dx ≤ lim inf

|Du(x) + Dyu0(x, y)|β dy dx < ∞.

Similarly, (14)1, the assumption on growth of S, Lemma 2.5 (v) and (ii) together with the deﬁnition of f ∗
imply (31).
Finally, we infer that for any W = Dw ∈ G(Y ) and almost all x ∈ Ω

ZY

π1(x, y)I : W(y) dy =ZY

π1(x, y) divy w(y) dy = 0.

Hence π1(x, ·)I ∈ G⊥(Y ), Lemma 2.5 (v) and (ii) together with the deﬁnition of f ∗ imply (32).

{uε} ⊂ W 1,β

(cid:0)Ω; Rd(cid:1) satisfy

Then there is c > 0 such that for any λ > 0 there is a sequence {uε,λ} ⊂ W 1,∞

Moreover, a subsequence (not relabeled) of {uλ} can be selected such that

Duλ ⇀ Du in Lβ(Ω; Rd×d

Proof. The application of Theorem 2.4 to the sequence {uε} yields for any λ > 0 the existence of a sequence
{uε,λ} ⊂ W 1,∞

(Ω; Rd) satisfying

Utilizing (40), Friedrichs and Korn’s inequalities, we obtain

|Duε|β + λβ|{x ∈ Ω : uε(x) 6= uε,λ(x)}|

which implies (37) due to (36).

The convergence (38) up to a subsequence follows immediately from (40)1. Moreover, the estimate (40)1

and the weak lower semicontinuity of the Lβ−norm imply the existence of a positive constant c such that

kDuλkLβ(Ω) ≤ c.

Hence we can pick a function ˜u ∈ W 1,β

0

(Ω; Rd) such that

uλ ⇀ ˜u in W 1,β(Ω; Rd).

It remains to show ˜u = u. Using the boundedness of the sequences {uε}, {uε,λ} in W 1,β(Ω; Rd) and the
estimate (40)2, we obtain

ZΩ

|uε,λ − uε| =Z{uε,λ6=uε}

Remark 4.1. The improvement of Lemma 4.5 for the case when δ = 0 in (5) requires a variant of Theorem
2.4. The proof of Theorem 2.4 is based on the boundedness of the maximal operator in Lβ(Rd). The above
expressed case of the stress tensor leads to spaces Lp( x
ε ). For the boundedness of the maximal operator on
Lebesgue space with variable exponent p it is necessary to assume that p is log-H¨older continuous, i.e. there
are cplog > 0 and p∞ ∈ R such that for any x, y ∈ Rd

|p(x) − p(y)| ≤

c

log(cid:16)e + 1

|x−y|(cid:17) , |p(x) − p∞| ≤

c

log(e + |x|)

,

see [4, Chapter 4 of Part I]. As estimates of the norm of the maximal operator in the proof of Theorem 2.4
are independent of ε, the same is needed also in the case of Lebesgue spaces Lp( x
ε ). But it is unclear whether
this uniform boundedness of the maximal operator holds or not. In particular, it does not follow from the
log-H¨older continuity of p.

Lemma 4.6. Let {Ωn}, {Sε} be from Lemma 4.2, O ⋐ Ω be arbitrary open and denote ˜Ωn = Ωn ∩ O. Then
for each n ∈ N

S Ej ⊂ Ωn0 and |Ej | → 0 then as j → 0

kSεkLβ′ (Ej ) + kπε,1kLβ′ (Ej ) → 0

(42)

uniformly with respect to ε, which is a direct consequence of Lemma 4.2. For ﬁxed n ∈ N and any ε′ > 0 we
ﬁnd {uε,λ} by Lemma 4.5. Then using the solenoidality of uε we decompose

Z ˜Ωn

Sε : Duε =Z ˜Ωn

(Sε − πε,1I) : Duε =Z ˜Ωn

We want perform the limit passage ε → 0 and then λ → ∞ in both terms on the right hand side of the latter

For the limit passage ε → 0 in II ε,λ we employ Lemma 2.2. Let us pick q ∈ (1, s), where s is determined by
(12). We have for any w ∈ W 1,q′

(O; Rd)

hdiv(Sε − πεI), wi = −ZO(cid:0)F + uε ⊗ uε + (πε,2 + πε,3)I(cid:1) : Dw.

It follows from Lemma 4.1 that {F + uε ⊗ uε + (πε,2 + πε,3)I} is precompact in Lq(O; Rd×d
sym). Therefore
we obtain that {div(Sε + πε,1I)} is precompact in W −1,q(O; Rd). We observe that curl(Duε,λ) = 0. Then
Lemma 2.2 and the convergences (23)4,5 and (38) imply

(Sε − πε,1I) : Duε,λ ⇀ (S − π1I) : Duλ in Lr(O), r > 1

In order to
obtain that we consider U ∈ Lβ( ˜Ωn × Y ; Rd×d
sym)) such that Uk → U in
Lβ( ˜Ωn × Y ; Rd×d
sym). Then we have due to the growth of S and Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem
that S(y, Uk) → S(y, U) in Lβ ′
sym). Therefore one deduce the accomplishment of (46) for
any U ∈ Lβ( ˜Ωn × Y ; Rd×d
sym). Minty’s trick yields that S0(x, y) = S(y, Du(x) + V(x, y)) for almost all
(x, y) ∈ ˜Ωn × Y . Since |Ω \ Ωn| → 0 and O ⋐ Ω was arbitrary, we have for almost all (x, y) ∈ Ω × Y
S0(x, y) = S(y, Du(x) + V(x, y)). Moreover, due to the properties (27) and (28) we obtain that V is a
solution of the cell problem (16) with ξ = Du(x). Consequently, (31) and the deﬁnition of the homogenized
