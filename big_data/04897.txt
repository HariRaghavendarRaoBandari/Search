LOCALLY PIECEWISE AFFINE FUNCTIONS AND

THEIR ORDER STRUCTURE

S. ADEEB AND V. G. TROITSKY

Abstract. Piecewise aﬃne functions on subsets of Rm were stud-
ied in [11, 7, 8, 9]. In this paper we study a more general concept
of a locally piecewise aﬃne function. We characterize locally piece-
wise aﬃne functions in terms of components and regions. We prove
that a positive function is locally piecewise aﬃne iﬀ it is the supre-
mum of a locally ﬁnite sequence of piecewise aﬃne functions. We
prove that locally piecewise aﬃne functions are uniformly dense
in C(Rm), while piecewise aﬃne functions are sequentially order
dense in C(Rm).

This paper is partially based on [3].

1. Piecewise affine functions

We start with a brief overview of aﬃne and piecewise aﬃne functions;

we refer the reader to [11, 7] and [9, Chapter 7] for details.

Fix m ∈ N. By an aﬃne function we mean a function f : Rm → R
of form f (x) = hv, xi+b for some v ∈ Rm and b ∈ R. Its kernel {f = 0}
is an aﬃne hyperplane in Rm. It is easy to see that any two aﬃne
functions which agree on a non-empty open set are equal. We write
A for the vector space of all aﬃne functions on Rm. Clearly, A is a
subspace of C(Rm), the space of all real-valued continuous functions
on Rm.

Let Ω be a convex closed subset of Rm with non-empty interior. Fol-
lowing [9], we call such a set a solid domain. A continuous function
f : Ω → R is called piecewise aﬃne if it agrees with ﬁnitely many

aﬃne functions. That is, there exist f1 . . . , fn ∈ A such that for ev-
ery x ∈ Ω there exists i ≤ n with f (x) = fi(x). Equivalently (see
Deﬁnition 7.10 and Theorem 7.13 in [9]), a function f : Ω → R is piece-
wise aﬃne iﬀ there exist distinct aﬃne functions f1, . . . , fn and subsets
S1, . . . , Sn of Ω such that

(1) on Si, f agrees with fi;
(2) Si = Int Si 6= ∅ for every i;
(3) Int Si ∩ Int Sj = ∅ whenever i 6= j;
(4) Sn

i=1 Si = Ω.

In particular, it follows from (2) that the set {f = fi} has non-empty in-
i=1, and (cid:8)(Si, fi)(cid:9)n
terior for every i = 1, . . . , n. The sets {fi}n
i=1
are called the components, regions, and characteristic pairs of f ,
respectively. The characteristic pairs of f are unique up to re-ordering.
We write PA(Ω) for the space of all piecewise aﬃne functions on Ω.
We put PA = PA(Rm).

i=1, {Si}n

Suppose f ∈ PA(Ω) with characteristic pairs (cid:8)(Si, fi)(cid:9)n

i=1. For each
pair (i, j) with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i 6= j, the set (cid:8)x ∈ Rm : fi(x) = fj(x)(cid:9),
or {fi = fj} is a hyperplane in Rm. Let C be the union of all such
hyperplanes. Then C is a closed set with empty interior. It is easy to
see that the set (Int Ω)\C is open, dense in Ω, and naturally partitioned
into a ﬁnite number of convex open subsets. We call these subsets the
cells of f .

Let K be a cell of f . Since K is disjoint from C, no two components
agree at any point of K. It follows that there exists a component fi
such that f agrees with fi on K, so that K ⊆ Si. It also follows that for
every j 6= i we either have fj(x) < f (x) for all x ∈ K or fj(x) > f (x)
for all x ∈ K.
Example 1.1. Let m = 1 and f (t) = min(cid:8)|t|, 1(cid:9). Then f is piecewise
aﬃne on R, with components f1(t) = t, f2(t) = −t, and f3(t) = 1, and
with regions S1 = [0, 1], S2 = [−1, 1], and S3 = (−∞, −1] ∪ [1, +∞).
Note that S3 is not connected. The cells of f are K1 = (−∞, −1),
K2 = (−1, 0), K3 = (0, 1), and K4 = (1, +∞).

Recall that under pointwise order, the space C(Ω) is a vector lattice.

It is easy to see that PA(Ω) is a (vector) sublattice of C(Ω).

LOCALLY PIECEWISE AFFINE FUNCTIONS

Let A be a subset of a vector lattice V . Recall that

A∨ = (cid:8)x1 ∨ · · · ∨ xn : n ∈ N, x1, . . . , xn ∈ A(cid:9) and
A∧ = (cid:8)x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xn : n ∈ N, x1, . . . , xn ∈ A(cid:9).

If A is a linear subspace of V then A∨∧ = A∧∨ and this set is exactly
the sublattice generated by A in V ; see, e.g., [9, Lemma 1.21].

Since A ⊆ PA and PA is a sublattice of C(Rm), it follows that
A∧∨ ⊆ PA. In fact, [9, Theorem 7.23] asserts that PA = A∧∨, hence
PA is exactly the sublattice of C(Rm) generated by A. Moreover, if Ω is
a solid domain in Rm and f ∈ PA(Ω) with component set F = {fi}n
i=1
then f ∈ F ∧∨ or, more precisely, f agrees with the restriction to Ω of
a function in F ∧∨. Since every function in F ∧∨ is deﬁned on all of Rm,
it follows that every function in PA(Ω) extends to a function in PA.

We write Bm

∞ for the closed unit ball of ℓm
∞:
|xi| ≤ 1(cid:9).

∞ = (cid:8)x ∈ Rm : max
Bm

1≤i≤m

For n ∈ N, we write Ωn for the ball of radius n centred at zero in ℓm
∞;
i.e., Ωn = nBm
∞.

2. Locally piecewise affine functions

A function f : Rm → R is said to be locally piecewise aﬃne if its
restriction to any bounded solid domain Ω is in PA(Ω). The following
lemma is straightforward.

Lemma 2.1. Let f : Rm → R. Then f is locally piecewise aﬃne iﬀ
the restriction of f to Ωn is in PA(Ωn) for every n ∈ N.

We write LPA for the collection of all locally piecewise aﬃne func-
tions on Rm. Clearly, LPA is a sublattice of C(Rm) and A ( PA (
LPA.

Let F ⊂ C(Rm). We say that F is locally ﬁnite if for every compact
set C all but ﬁnitely many functions in F vanish on C. That is, the
set (cid:8)f ∈ F : ∃x ∈ C f (x) 6= 0(cid:9) is ﬁnite. Just as in Lemma 2.1, it is
easy to see that F is locally ﬁnite iﬀ for every n all but ﬁnitely many
functions in F vanish on Ωn. Clearly, any subset of a locally ﬁnite set

4

S. ADEEB AND V. G. TROITSKY

of functions is again locally ﬁnite. Additionally, if F ⊂ C(Rm) is a
locally ﬁnite set of functions, then F ∨, F ∧ and consequently F ∨∧ are
all locally ﬁnite. If F is a sequence, then F is termed a locally ﬁnite
sequence of functions.

It is a standard fact that C(Rm) is not order complete. Yet we have

the following.

Lemma 2.2. Every locally ﬁnite subset of PA has a supremum and an
inﬁmum in C(Rm), which belong to LPA and agree with the pointwise
maximum and minimum, respectively.

Proof. Let F ⊆ PA be a locally ﬁnite set. For every point x ∈ Rm, all
but ﬁnitely many members of F vanish at x. Hence, h(x) = max(cid:8)f (x) :
f ∈ F(cid:9) is deﬁned. Similarly, on every open ball B in Rm, h is the point-
wise maximum of a ﬁnite subcollection of F , so that h is continuous
on B; it follows that h ∈ C(Rm). It follows from the deﬁnition that
h = sup F in C(Rm). It also follows that on every ball, h agrees with
a ﬁnite subset of F , hence h is locally piecewise aﬃne. The proof for
the inﬁmum is similar.
(cid:3)

We write 1 for the constant one function on Rm.

Lemma 2.3. For every ε > 0 there exists f ∈ PA such that 0 ≤ f ≤ 1,
f equals 1 on Bm

∞, and vanishes outside of (1 + ε)Bm
∞.

Proof. Put g(x) = kxk∞ = maxi≤m|xi| for x ∈ Rm. Put h : R+ → R+
so that h is continuous, equals 1 on [0, 1], vanishes on [1 + ε, +∞)
and is aﬃne on [1, 1 + ε]. Let f = h ◦ g. Being the composition of
two piecewise aﬃne functions, f is itself piecewise aﬃne. It is easy to
verify that f satisﬁes the rest of the requirements.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.4. For every 0 ≤ f ∈ LPA there exists a locally ﬁnite
sequence (fi) in PA+ such that f = sup fi.

Proof. Let (cn) be an enumeration of all integer points in Rm. Consider
the “boxes” Kn = cn + Bm

∞ and eKn = cn + 2Bm
∞.

Fix n. Since f is continuous, it is bounded on Kn. Let M > 0 be
such that f (x) < M for all x ∈ Kn. As in Lemma 2.3, we can ﬁnd a
piecewise aﬃne function gn such that 0 ≤ gn ≤ M 1, gn equals M on

LOCALLY PIECEWISE AFFINE FUNCTIONS

5

Kn, and gn vanishes outside eKn. Put fn = f ∧ gn. We will show that
the sequence (fn) satisﬁes all the requirements.

By construction, 0 ≤ fn ≤ f , fn agrees with f on Kn and vanishes
outside eKn. Observe that fn is piecewise aﬃne because on eKn it agrees
with f ∧ gn, which is piecewise aﬃne on eKn and fn vanishes outside
of eKn. The sequence (fn) is locally ﬁnite because for every n the only
members of the sequence that do not vanish on Kn are fn itself and
the members corresponding to the (ﬁnitely many) boxes that meet eKn.
Finally, f = sup fn because 0 ≤ fn ≤ f and fn agrees with f on Kn
for every n.
(cid:3)

3. Characteristic pairs of locally piecewise functions

Recall that every piecewise aﬃne function is determined by its com-
ponents and regions. The following theorem provides a similar charac-
terization for locally piecewise aﬃne functions.

Theorem 3.1. A function f : Rm → R is locally piecewise aﬃne iﬀ
there exist a sequence of distinct aﬃne functions (fi) and a sequence
(Si) of subsets of Rm such that

(1) on Si, f agrees with fi;
(2) Si = Int Si 6= ∅ for every i;
(3) Int Si ∩ Int Sj = ∅ whenever i 6= j;
(4) S∞
(5) every bounded set meets only ﬁnitely many Si’s.

i=1 Si = Rm;

Proof. Suppose that f satisﬁes the ﬁve conditions; show that it is lo-
cally piecewise aﬃne. First, observe that f is continuous. Indeed, sup-
pose that xn → x in Rm but f (xn) 6→ f (x). Passing to a subsequence,

we can ﬁnd an ε > 0 such that (cid:12)(cid:12)f (xn) − f (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) > ε and xn ∈ B(x, 1) for

every n. By (5), the ball B(x, 1) meets only ﬁnitely many Si’s. Hence,
passing to a further subsequence, we may assume that the sequence
(xn) is contained in Si for some i. Since Si is closed, we have x ∈ Si. It
follows that f (xn) = fi(xn) → fi(x) = f (x); a contradiction. Thus, f
is continuous. By (5) again, every bounded solid domain Ω is contained
in the union of ﬁnitely many Si’s; it follows that the restriction of f to
Ω is in PA(Ω), so that f is locally piecewise aﬃne.

6

S. ADEEB AND V. G. TROITSKY

Suppose now that f is locally piecewise aﬃne. Fix n ∈ N. The
restriction of f to Ωn is in PA(Ωn); consider the aﬃne components of
this restriction. By collecting the aﬃne functions associated with Ωn
for all n ∈ N, we produce a sequence (fi) in A such that for every n
there exists kn such that f agrees with f1, . . . , fkn on Ωn. By dropping
repeated terms, we may assume without loss of generality that all the
members in this sequence are distinct.

For every i, put Ui = Int{f = fi} and Si = Ui. Since fi is a
component of the restriction of f to Ωn for some n, it follows that
Ui 6= ∅. It is easy to see that (1) and (2) are satisﬁed. To show (3),
suppose that Int Si meets Int Sj for some i and j. This follows that fi
and fj agree on an open set, hence fi = fj and, therefore, i = j.

Fix x ∈ Rm and take n ∈ N such that x ∈ Int(Ωn). Let K1, . . . , Kl
be the cells generated in Ωn by f1, . . . , fkn. Since Sl
j=1 Kp is dense in
Ωn, we have x ∈ Kp for some p ≤ l. Note that Kp is open and f agrees
with some fi on Kp. It follows that Kp ⊆ Ui and, therefore, x ∈ Si.
This yields (4).

Finally, we will show that Int(Ωn) only meets S1, . . . , Skn; this will
immediately yield (5). Suppose that Int(Ωn) meets Si for some i ∈ N.
It follows that Int(Ωn) meets Ui. This implies that Ui meets Kr for
some r ≤ l. Note that f agrees with fj on Kr for some j ≤ kn. It
follows that fj and fi agree on the non-empty open set Kr ∩ Ui, hence
j = i and, therefore, i ≤ kn.
(cid:3)

As before, the sets {fi}∞

i=1, and (cid:8)(Si, fi)(cid:9) are called the
components, regions, and characteristic pairs of f , respectively.

4. LPA is uniformly dense in C(Rm)

It is of interest whether every continuous function on Rm can be
approximated in some sense by piecewise aﬃne functions. We will
consider two kinds of denseness here: uniform denseness and order
denseness. We start with uniform denseness. It is easy to see that PA
is not uniformly dense in C(Rm) even for m = 1.

LOCALLY PIECEWISE AFFINE FUNCTIONS

Theorem 4.1. LPA is uniformly dense in C(Rm). That is, for every
f ∈ C(Rm) and every ε > 0 there exists h ∈ LPA such that |f − h| ≤
ε1.

Proof. The proof is analogous to that of Theorem 2.4. Let f ∈ C(Rm)
and ε > 0.

First, we consider the case when f ≥ 0. Let (cn) be an enumeration
∞ and

of all integer points in Rm. Consider the “boxes” Kn = cn + Bm
eKn = cn + 2Bm
∞.

j (x) 6= e∗

j (y), where e∗

Fix n. Observe that PA( eKn) is a sublattice of C( eKn). It clearly
contains constant functions. It is easy to see that it separates points.
Indeed, let x, y ∈ eKn with x 6= y. Then xj 6= yj for some j ≤ m. That
is, e∗
j is the j-th coordinate functional. Clearly,
j is an aﬃne function. Since eKn is compact, it now follows from the
e∗
lattice version of Stone-Weierstrass Theorem that PA( eKn) is uniformly
dense in C( eKn), see, e.g., Theorem 11.3 on page 88 of [4]. It follows
that there is hn ∈ PA( eKn) such that (cid:12)(cid:12)hn(x) − f (x)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε for all x ∈ eKn.
Extend hn to a piecewise aﬃne function ˜hn in PA.
Since hn is continuous on eKn, it is bounded on eKn. Let Mn > 0
be such that hn(x) < Mn for all x ∈ eKn. As in Lemma 2.3, we can
ﬁnd gn ∈ PA such that 0 ≤ gn ≤ Mn1, gn equals Mn on Kn, and gn
vanishes outside eKn.
Consider the sequence of functions (cid:0)˜hn ∧ gn(cid:1). Since gn vanishes
outside of eKn, all but ﬁnitely many terms of this sequence vanish on
Kn; it follows that the sequence (cid:0)˜hn ∧ gn(cid:1) is locally ﬁnite. Let h =
˜hn ∧ gn; by Lemma 2.2 this supremum exists, agrees with the
supn
pointwise maximum, and belongs to LPA.

For every n and every x ∈ Kn, we have

h(x) ≥ (˜hn ∧ gn)(x) = hn(x) ∧ Mn = hn(x) ≥ f (x) − ε.

It follows that h ≥ f − ε1, so that h − f ≥ −ε1.

On the other hand, for every n and every x ∈ eKn we have

(˜hn ∧ gn)(x) ≤ hn(x) ≤ f (x) + ε.

8

S. ADEEB AND V. G. TROITSKY

Since ˜hn ∧ gn ≤ gn, it vanishes outside of eKn. It follows that ˜hn ∧ gn ≤
f + ε1. Taking sup over n we get h ≤ f + ε1, so that h − f ≤ ε1.
Therefore, |h − f | ≤ ε1.

Suppose now that f is an arbitrary function in C(Rm). Then f =
f + − f −, with 0 ≤ f +, f − ∈ C(Rm). By the ﬁrst part of the proof, we
ﬁnd h1 and h2 in LPA such that |f + − h1| ≤ ε
1.
Put h = h1 − h2, then

1 and |f − − h2| ≤ ε

2

2

|f − h| ≤ |f + − h1| + |f − − h2| ≤ ε1.

(cid:3)

5. PA is σ-order dense in C(Rm)

Recall that a sublattice F of an Archimedean vector lattice E is said
to be order dense if for every 0 < x ∈ E there exists y ∈ F with
0 < y ≤ x. Equivalently, for every 0 < x ∈ E we have x = sup A where
A = {y ∈ F : 0 ≤ y ≤ x}; see, e.g., [6, Theorem 1.34]. Note that the
set A may be viewed as an increasing net. Therefore, F is order dense
in E iﬀ every element of E+ is the supremum of an increasing net in
F+.

Let f ∈ C(Rm). Suppose that f > 0; that is, f (x) ≥ 0 for every
x ∈ Rm and f (c) > 0 for some c ∈ Rm. It follows easily from Lemma 2.3
that there exists a locally piecewise function h such that 0 < h ≤ f .
This means that PA is an order dense sublattice in C(Rm). It follows
that if 0 ≤ f ∈ C(Rm) then f is the supremum of an increasing net
(fα) in PA, that is, fα ↑ f . This leads to two natural questions.

Question 5.1. Can we replace a net with a sequence?

Question 5.2. How do we deal with non-positive functions?

The answer to the ﬁrst question is related to the countable sup prop-
erty. Recall that a vector lattice E has the countable sup property
if every increasing net (xα) in E with x = sup xα has an increasing sub-
sequence with the same supremum. Thus, to answer the ﬁrst question,
it suﬃces to prove that C(Rm) has the countable sup property.

Recall that for a sequence (xα) in a vector lattice E, the notation
xα ↑ means (xα) is increasing; xα ↑≤ x means xα ↑ and xα ≤ x for

LOCALLY PIECEWISE AFFINE FUNCTIONS

9

every α, and xα ↑ x means xα ↑ and x = supα xα. Note that fα ↑ f
in C(Ω) does not imply pointwise convergence. For f, g ∈ C(Rm), the
notation f < g means f ≤ g and f 6= g. For f ∈ C(Rm) and a solid
domain Ω in Rm, we write f|Ω for the restriction of f to Ω; we view it
as an element of C(Ω).

Lemma 5.3. Let (fα) be a net in C(Rm) and f ∈ C(Rm). Then fα ↑ f
in C(Rm) iﬀ fα|Ωn ↑ f|Ωn in C(Ωn) for every n.

Proof. Suppose that fα ↑ f in C(Rm). Fix n. It is clear that (fα|Ωn)
is an increasing net in C(Ωn) and f|Ωn is an upper bound of this net.
Suppose it is not the least upper bound. Then there exists g ∈ C(Ωn)
such that fα|Ωn ≤ g for every α but g(t0) < f (t0) for some t0 ∈ Ωn.
Since Ωn is a solid domain, we may assume that t0 ∈ Int Ωn. It follows
easily that there exists a neighborhood V of t0 and ε > 0 such that
V ⊆ Int Ωn and g(t) < f (t) − ε for all t ∈ V . Find 0 < h ∈ C(Rm) such
that h(t0) > 0, h(t) < ε for all t ∈ V , and h vanishes outside V . Then
f − h < f , yet fα ≤ f − h for every α; this contradicts f = sup fα.

Conversely, suppose that fα|Ωn ↑ f|Ωn in C(Ωn) for every n. First,
we claim that fα ↑≤ f in C(Rm). Indeed, ﬁx any t0 ∈ Rm. Find n
so that t0 ∈ Ωn. It follows from fα|Ωn ↑ f|Ωn that fα(t0) ↑≤ f (t0). In
particular, f is an upper bound of (fα) in C(Rm).

On the other hand, suppose that g is an upper bound of (fα) in
C(Rm). Fix any n. Then g|Ωn ≥ fα|Ωn ↑ f|Ωn yields g|Ωn ≥ f|Ωn. This
is true for all n; therefore, g ≥ f . It follows that f = supα fα.
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.4. C(Rm) has the countable sup property.

Proof. Let (fα)α∈Λ be a net in C(Rm) indexed by some directed set Λ
such that fα ↑ f for some f ∈ C(Rm). Fix n ∈ N. By Lemma 5.3, we
have fα|Ωn ↑ f|Ωn in C(Ωn). Recall that every vector lattice which ad-
mits a strictly positive functional has the countable sup property; see,
e.g., [5, Theorem 2.6]. Since the Riemann integral is a strictly positive
functional on Ωn, it follows that C(Ωn) has the countable sup prop-
erty. Therefore, the net (fα|Ωn) has a subsequence whose supremum in
C(Ωn) is f|Ωn.

We will now inductively construct a double sequence (αn,k) in Λ

indexed by pairs (n, k) ∈ N2 satisfying the following two conditions

(1) (αn,k) is increasing: if n1 ≤ n2 and k1 ≤ k2 then αn1,k1 ≤ αn2,k2;
(2) for every n we have fαn,k |Ωn

↑ f|Ωn as k → ∞.

For n = 1, let (α1,k)∞
fα1,k |Ω1

k=1 be an increasing sequence in Λ such that

↑ f|Ω1 as k → ∞; it exists by the preceding paragraph.

Suppose that we have constructed αi,k for all i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and all
k. We will now construct αn,k for all k. Find an increasing sequence
↑ f|Ωn in C(Ωn) as k → ∞. Now choose
(βk) in Λ such that fβk |Ωn
αn,1 to be any index greater than β1 and αn−1,1. Choose αn,2 to be any
index greater than β2, αn−1,2, and αn,1. Proceed inductively: once we
have deﬁned αn,1, . . . , αn,k−1, choose αn,k to be any index greater than
βk, αn−1,k, and αn,k−1. This yields

f|Ωn ≥ fαn,k |Ωn

≥ fβk |Ωn

↑ f|Ωn,

↑ f|Ωn in C(Ωn) as k → ∞. Also, it is easy to see that

so that fαn,k |Ωn
(αn,k) is increasing.
Consider (αk,k)∞

k=1. This is clearly an increasing sequence in Λ. If
↑
n ≤ k then αn,k ≤ αk,k, so that fαn,k ≤ fαk,k ≤ f . This yields fαk,k |Ωn
f|Ωn in C(Ωn) as k → ∞. It now follows from Lemma 5.3 that fαk,k ↑ f
in C(Rm).
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.5. For every 0 ≤ f ∈ C(Rm) there exists a sequence (hn)
of positive piecewise aﬃne functions such that hn ↑ f in C(Rm).

Thus, Question 5.1 has the aﬃrmative answer. We now pass to
Question 5.2. We answer it through order convergence. In literature,
there are two slightly diﬀerent deﬁnitions of an order convergent net
in a vector lattice, which are, generally, not equivalent. We refer the
reader to [10, 1, 2]. In our case, it will be irrelevant which of the two
deﬁnitions is used for the following two reasons: ﬁrst, both deﬁnitions
yield the properties that we will be using and, second, by [10], the
two deﬁnitions agree in vector lattices which have the countable sup
property; hence, they agree in C(Rm).

Proposition 5.6. Every function in C(Rm) is the order limit of an
order convergent sequence of piecewise aﬃne functions.

Proof. Let f ∈ C(Rm). Decompose it as f = f +−f −. By Corollary 5.5,
there exist positive sequences (gn) and (hh) in PA such that gn ↑ f +
and hn ↑ f − in C(Rm). It follows that the sequence (gn − hn) converges
in order to f in C(Rm).
