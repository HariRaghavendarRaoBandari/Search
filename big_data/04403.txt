ABSTRACT

Context. 4U 1323-619 is a low mass X-ray binary system that shows type I X-ray bursts and dips. The most accurate estimation of
the orbital period is 2.941923(36) hrs and a distance from the source that is lower than 11 kpc has been proposed.
Aims. We aim to obtain the orbital ephemeris, the orbital period of the system, as well as its derivative to compare the observed
luminosity with that predicted by the theory of secular evolution.
Methods.We took the advantage of about 26 years of X-ray data and grouped the selected observations when close in time. We folded
the light curves and used the timing technique, obtaining 12 dip arrival times. We ﬁt the delays of the dip arrival times both with a
linear and a quadratic function.
Results. We locate 4U 1323-619 within a circular area centred at RA (J2000)= 201.6543◦ and DEC (J2000)= -62.1358◦ with an
associated error of 0.0002◦, and conﬁrm the detection of the IR counterpart already discussed in literature. We estimate an orbital
period of P=2.9419156(6) hrs compatible with the estimations that are present in the literature, but with an accuracy ten times higher.
We also obtain a constraint on the orbital period derivative for the ﬁrst time, estimating ˙P = (8 ± 13) × 10−12 s/s. Assuming that the
companion star is in thermal equilibrium in the lower main sequence, and is a neutron star of 1.4 M⊙, we infer a mass of 0.28±0.03 M⊙
for the companion star. Assuming a distance of 10 kpc, we obtained a luminosity of (4.3±0.5)×1036 erg s−1, which is not in agreement
with what is predicted by the theory of secular evolution. Using a 3D extinction map of the Ks radiation in our Galaxy, we obtain
−0.7 kpc at 68% conﬁdence level. This distance implies a luminosity estimation of (0.8±0.3)×1036 erg s−1, which is
a distance of 4.2+0.8
consistent with the adopted scenario in which the companion star is in thermal equilibrium.

1. Introduction

4U 1323-619 is a low mass X-rays binary system (LMXB) that
was discovered by Forman et al. (1978) and identiﬁed as persis-
tent by Warwick et al. (1981). Periodic dips and type I bursts
were discovered in the European X-ray Observatory Satellite
(EXOSAT) light curves (van der Klis et al. 1985; Parmar et al.
1989). The matter transferred from the companion star, impact-
ing onto the outer accretion disc, forms a bulge of cold (and/or
partially ionised) matter that photoelectrically absorbs part of
the X-ray emission, which comes from the inner region of the
system. The shape of a dip is generally irregular and varies
from one cycle to another. However, the periodic occurrence
of the dips in the light curve is strictly connected to the or-
bital motion of the binary system and the study of their peri-
odicity can give information on the orbital period of the system.
From EXOSAT and BeppoSAX lightcurves, Parmar et al. (1989)
and Bałuci´nska-Church et al. (1999) inferred an orbital period of
2.932(5) hrs and 2.94(2) hrs, respectively. Levine et al. (2011),
studying the RossiXTE/ASM 1.5-12 keV light curve from 1996
to 2011, ﬁnd an orbital period of 2.941923(36) hrs. Although
the light curves of 4U 1323-619 show dips, they do not show
eclipses, which implies that the source has an inclination an-

gle i between 60◦ and 80◦ (Frank et al. 1987). Zolotukhin et al.
(2010), using a Chandra observation performed in continuous
clocking mode, obtain the X-ray position of the source that, how-
ever, suﬀers from the indetermination in one direction because
of the Chandra observational mode. The same authors also es-
timate the X-ray position of the source with an associated error
of 3" using data of the X-ray Multi Mirror (XMM-Newton) mis-
sion. Zolotukhin et al. (2010), analysing the 2MASS catalogue,
identify two possible infrared counterparts of 4U 1323-619 that
are associated with the X-ray position estimated using XMM-
Newton data. From the intersection of the positional error boxes
of Chandra and XMM-Newton, they suggest that the probable
infrared counterpart is a source with a magnitude of 18.12±0.20
in the Ks band.

The spectral analysis of the source shows that the equivalent
column density of neutral hydrogen, NH, is large and depends on
the model used to ﬁt the spectra and on the energy band covered.

NH = (4.0 ± 0.3) × 1022 cm−2 using EXOSAT data. Smale (1995)
suggested that the large extinction to the source also explains
why the optical counterpart has not been detected yet. Further-

more, Bałuci´nska-Church et al. (1999) suggested the possible
presence of a local dust halo surrounding 4U 1323-619. The
main eﬀect of the halo is to absorb part of the source radiation
owing to its optical depth, which depends on the inverse of the
incoming radiation energy (Predehl & Schmitt 1995).

The spectral analysis of 4U 1323-619 also highlights that
the energy spectrum is dominated by a power-law component.
Parmar et al. (1989) found a photon index Γ of the power-
law component of 1.53±0.07, Boirin et al. (2005) obtain a
Γ of 1.9+0.06
−0.10 and, adopting a cut-oﬀ power-law component,
Bałuci´nska-Church et al. (2009) ﬁnd a Γ of 1.67+0.10
−0.03 and an en-
ergy cut-oﬀ of 85+77
−35 keV. Galloway et al. (2008), analysing the
type I X-ray bursts properties of 4U 1323-619 with data ob-
tained with the proportional counter array (PCA) on board the
RXTE mission, only infer an upper limit for the distance from
the source because they do not ﬁnd any evidence of photospheric
radius expansion (PRE). The upper limit is of 11 kpc, assuming a
companion star with cosmic abundances, and of 15 kpc, assum-
ing a pure hydrogen companion star. Furthermore, the same au-
thors show that the light curves demonstrate many double bursts
where the secondary bursts are fainter and suggest that this can
be explained taking into account a mixed composition of hy-
drogen and helium of the companion star, which causes short
recurrence bursts generated by the hydrogen ignition onto the
neutron star. In addition, using EXOSAT/ME data in the energy
band 1.5-11 keV, Parmar et al. (1989) gave a lower limit of 10
kpc for the distance from the source on the basis of the observed
properties of the bursts.

Zolotukhin et al. (2010), studying the photometric properties
of 4U 1323-619 in the IR band and assuming a distance of
10 kpc, ﬁnd a discrepancy of one order of magnitude between
the observed value of the ﬂux and that predicted by a model
that describes the system as an accretion disk illuminated by a
central spherical hot corona, which has a luminosity of 5.2×1036
erg s−1 in the 0.1-10 keV band (Boirin et al. 2005). Based on this
discrepancy, they suggest a distance from the source between 4
and 5 kpc.

In this work, we ﬁnd the ﬁrst orbital linear and quadratic
ephemerides of 4U 1323-619, using all the available X-ray point-
ing observations from 1985 to 2011. We ﬁnd a weak constraint
on the orbital period derivative. We compare the obtained results
with the prediction of the secular evolution of the binary system
(see e.g. King 1988; Verbunt 1993) and suggest that the source
distance is less than 5 kpc (close to 4.2 kpc for a companion star
in thermal equilibrium).

2. Observation and data reduction

To analyse the dips arrival times of 4U 1323-619, we used all
the available X-ray archival data that include RXTE, Chandra,
XMM-Newton, Suzaku, BeppoSAX, EXOSAT and ASCA obser-
vations.

We used the Chandra data of the ObsIDs 13721, 14377,
and 3826. Both the ObsID 13721 and ObsID 14377 data were
collected in December 2011 in timed graded mode, while the
data of the ObsID 3826 were taken in continuous clocking
mode in September 2003. To process the Chandra data we used
CIAO v. 4.7. The observations have been reprocessed with the
chandra_repro routine. We used the ObsID 13721 to obtain an
accurate estimation of the X-ray source position using the Chan-
dra tool tg_findzo. The revised coordinates for 4U 1323-619
are: RA (J2000)= 201.6543◦ and DEC (J2000)= -62.1358◦, with
an associated error of 0.6", which represents the 90% conﬁdence
level Chandra positional accuracy1.
We report the Chandra/HETG image of 4U 1323-619 that was
obtained from the reprocessed level 2 data in Fig. 1. The green
and black circles indicate the X-ray source position shown in
this work and in Zolotukhin et al. (2010), respectively. The in-
frared sources, A and B, suggested by Zolotukhin et al. (2010)
are indicated with crosses and have an error circle with a radius
of 0.2". The B source is located inside a circular area, which has
a radius of 0.2" that has been determined with the 2MASS cat-
alogue. On the basis of our results we conﬁrm that the source
B is the infrared counterpart of 4U 1323-619 as suggested by
Zolotukhin et al. (2010). Hereafter we use the new X-ray Chan-
dra coordinates to apply the barycentric corrections.
We applied the barycentric corrections to the Level 2 events
ﬁle using the axbary tool and extracted the ﬁrst diﬀraction or-
ders and background-subtracted HEG + MEG light curves using
the dmextract tool. To subtract the background from the light
curves, we selected a background events extraction region of 5"
of radius, far away from the real source position.

The available RXTE/PCA observations span a period of
about 13 years (from 1997 to 2011). We produced background-
subtracted light curves, including all the energy channels and
obtained the data from the HEASARC data archive. These light
curves have a temporal resolution of 0.125 s and the barycentric
corrections have been applied using the faxbary tool.
The only available observation of XMM-Newton/Epic-pn is
the ObsID 0036140201 of January 2003, performed in timing
mode. The data have been processed with the epproc tool of the

Fig. 1: Chandra/HETG image of 4U 1323-619. The colour scale
reports the number of photons. The green circle indicates the
X-ray position obtained in this work, while the black circle in-
dicates the position obtained by Zolotukhin et al. (2010) using
XMM-Newton data. The A and B crosses are the two candidate
infrared counterparts identiﬁed by Zolotukhin et al. (2010).

Scientiﬁc Analysis System (SAS) v. 14.0.0 and the barycentric
corrections have been applied with the barycen tool. The
extraction region of the source photons has been chosen on
the basis of the analysis of the histogram showing the number
of photons versus the RAWX coordinate of the image. We
selected a box region with a width of 21 RAWX and centred at
the RAWX coordinate of the peak of the photons’ distribution
(RAWX=36). Thus, we extracted the light curve with the
evselect routine, selecting events with PATTERN≤4 (single
and double pixel events) and FLAG=0 (to ignore spurious
events), in the energy range between 0.5 and 10 keV. We binned
the resulting light curve at 1 s.
The available Suzaku observation of 4U 1323-619 is the ObsID
401002010 of January 2007. This has been processed with the
aepipeline routine and the two available data formats (3X3
and 5X5) have been uniﬁed with each other. We applied the
barycentric corrections to the events ﬁle with the aebarycen
routine. We extracted the 0.2-10 keV light curve using the
xselect tool and adopting a circular region around the bright-
est pixel of the source with a radius of 50". We used a bin time
of 16 s.
We also used the EXOSAT/ME observation performed on
February 1985. The light curve has been extracted in the
energy range between 1 and 8 keV with a bin time of 10 s and
the barycentric corrections have been applied with the ftool

Finally,
the only available observation of BeppoSAX is of
August 1997. The BeppoSAX/MECS light curve has been
extracted with the xselect ftool in a circular region of 4’
of radius, without energy ﬁlters and with a bin time of 4 s.
The barycentric corrections have been applied with the ftool

3. Data analysis

The whole analysed data-set spans a temporal range of about
26 years. All the selected observations have been grouped when
close in time to obtain folded light curves to increase the statis-
tics of the dips. We grouped the Chandra ObsIDs 13721 and
14377. The light curves of these observations are separately
shown in Fig. 2a and 2b with a bin time of 24 s. The curves
have been extracted from the ﬁrst diﬀraction order of the HETG
grating and the individual observations have a duration of about
62 and 80 ks, respectively. In the ObsID 14377 ﬁve dips occur,
plus one more at the beginning of the observation that is only
partially visible. In addition, during the observation 13 721 seven
dips occur, plus one more that is partially visible at the beginning
of the observation. In both observations several Type I bursts oc-
cur. The persistent emission is mainly at about 0.8 counts/s and
the count-rate at the bottom of the dips is close to 0.3 counts/s.
Three RXTE/PCA observations have been ruled out from our
analysis: the observation whose ObsID is P40040-01-02-01 be-
cause the dip is only partially visible in the light curve, as well
as the observations whose ObsIDs are P96405-01-03-00 and
P96405-01-04-00, owing to the lack of dips. We furthermore ex-
cluded four additional RXTE/PCA observations from our anal-
ysis (ObsIDs P96405-01-05-00, P96405- 01-05-01, P96405-01-
05-02, and P96405-01-05-03) and one Chandra observation (Ob-
sID 3826) owing to the fact that their folded light curves show
a high count-rate variability outside the dips that does not allow
us to obtain a valid ﬁt for the dips by using the step-and-ramp
function that we deﬁne below.

After this preventive selection process, we analysed 12 grouped
and barycentric-corrected light curves that contain a total of 95
dips. The observations that we selected for the analysis, as well
as their grouping, are shown in Tab. 1. Bursts were excluded
from each light curve by removing the segments starting 5 s be-
fore the rise time of each burst and ending 100 s after the peak
time. We veriﬁed that the shape of the dips in each light curve
is quite similar from one cycle to another and folded the light
curves with a reference time and a trial period (T f old and P0,
respectively). To estimate the dip arrival time, we adopted the
same procedure used by Iaria et al. (2015). For each light curve
T f old is deﬁned as the average value between the start and stop
time of the observation. We ﬁt the dip in each folded light curve
with a step-and-ramp function that involves seven parameters:
the count-rate before (Y1), during (Y2) and after (Y3) the dip,
and the phases of ingress (φ1 and φ2) and egress (φ3 and φ4) of
the dip. We show the step-and-ramp function ﬁtting the folded
light curve of the joint Chandra observations ObsID 14377 and
ObsID 13721 in Fig. 3.
The phase of the dip arrival has been estimated as φdip =
(φ1 + φ4)/2. The corresponding dip arrival time is given by
Tdip = T f old + φdipP0.
The values of the χ2
red in Tab. 2 are quite high. We can assume
that this is a direct cause of the underestimation of the errors as-
sociated with the ﬁtted data points. The uncertainties of all these
data points can be increased by a constant factor to have a χ2
red
equal to 1, multiplying the uncertainties on the ﬁtting parame-
red of the ﬁt. As a consequence
of this, for the calculations of the uncertainty on the ﬁtting pa-
rameters, all the uncertainties relative to the values of φdip have

ters by a factor equal to the qχ2

red, when the best-ﬁt model gave
red greater than 1. Moreover, we use a trial orbital period
P0 of 10590.864 s and a reference epoch T0 of 10683.4663 TJD
to obtain the delays of the dips’ arrival times with respect to the
reference epoch T0. We choose the values of P0 and T0 arbitrar-
ily, which are similar to those given by Levine et al. (2011). The
values of T f old are shown in Table 1, the best-ﬁt parameters and
the χ2
red obtained by ﬁtting the dips are shown in Table 2. Finally,
the dip arrival times, the cycle and the delays for each observa-
tion are shown in Table 3.
First, we ﬁt the obtained delays as a function of cycles with a lin-
ear function, taking into account only the errors associated with
the delays. The ﬁtting function is

at 68% conﬁdence level.
We also try to ﬁt the delays using a quadratic function:
y(N) = a + bN + cN2,

(3)

where a is the reference epoch correction (∆T0) in seconds, b is
2 P0 ˙P
the orbital period correction (∆P0) in seconds, and c = 1
in units of seconds. The best-ﬁt model parameters are reported
in Table 2. The ﬁt returns a value of the χ2(d.o. f .) of 36.04(9),
while the F-test probability of chance improvement with respect
to the previous linear ﬁt is only of 52%. This suggests that,
adopting the quadratic ephemeris, we do not improve the ﬁt sig-
niﬁcantly. The orbital ephemeris obtained with the quadratic ﬁt
is

y(N) = a + bN,

Tdip(N) = TJD(TDB) 10683.4641(7) +

(1)

where N is the cycle number, b is the correction to the trial orbital
period (∆P0) in seconds, and a is the correction to the trial refer-
ence epoch (∆T0) in seconds. Thus, we obtain a ﬁrst estimation
of the corrections to the reference epoch and to the orbital period.
Taking into account the error associated with the number of the

cycles (∆x), we obtain a total error ∆tot = p(∆y)2 + (b ∗ ∆x)2,

where ∆y is the error associated with the dip arrival time (see
Iaria et al. 2014). We repeated the ﬁtting procedure, obtaining
a χ2(d.o. f .) of 37.81(10). For the same reason adduced before,
the uncertainties of the parameters returned by the linear ﬁt have
red, when the best-ﬁt model gave
red greater than 1. The best-ﬁt model parameters are shown
in Table 4. The orbital ephemeris obtained with the linear model

versus the orbital cycles and, superimposed, two best-ﬁt models,
i.e. the linear and the quadratic ephemeris. At the bottom, the
residuals resulting from the linear ﬁt are shown. The maximum
discrepancy between the delays and the linear best-ﬁt model is
of about 300 s, which is about 2.8% of the orbital period.

To verify the goodness of the linear ephemeris shown in Eq.
2, we folded the RXTE/ASM light curve in the 2-10 keV energy
band. This light curve covers a time interval of 15.5 years (from
5 January 1996 to 24 September 2011) and barycentric correc-
tions have been applied using the faxbary tool. We show the
folded light curve using the reference epoch and orbital period
suggested by Levine et al. (2011) and by our linear ephemeris in
the left and right panels of Fig. 5, respectively. We adopted 14
phase bins per period (each phase bin corresponds to ∼757 s).

4. Spectral analysis

We present the spectral analysis of 4U 1323-619 performed with
INTEGRAL data. This analysis is useful in Sect. 5 when extract-
ing the unabsorbed ﬂux of the source between 0.5 and 100 keV,
to obtain an estimation of the luminosity.
We found a number of INTEGRAL pointings (science windows,
SCW) collected on 2003 July 10–13 in the ﬁeld of 4U 1323-619.
To maximize the spectral response, we selected only SCWs (with
a typical duration of 3 ks) with the source located within 4.5◦ and
3.5◦ from the centre of the IBIS and JEM-X FOVs, respectively.
Thus, we analysed IBIS/ISGRI (Lebrun et al. 2003) data of 80
SCWs and JEM-X2 (Lund et al. 2003) data of 51 SCWs (JEM-
1 was switched-oﬀ at that time) with the standard INTEGRAL
software OSA 10.1 (Courvoisier et al. 2003) We veriﬁed that, in
the JEM-X2 lightcurve, no type-I bursts were present and that
the source ﬂux was almost constant, so that, an averaged spectra
(3-35 keV) has been extracted in 16 channels for a total exposure
time of 156 ks. Because of the faintness of the source in hard X-
rays, the ISGRI spectrum has been extracted by the total (about
198 ks) mosaic image with the mosaic_spec tool in four energy
bins, spanning from 22 keV up to 65 keV.

The spectral analysis was performed using XSPEC v. 12.8.2
(Arnaud 1996). We modelled the joint JEM-X2 and ISGRI spec-
trum with a thermal Comptonisation (nthComp in XSPEC). This
spectral component takes into account the nature of the seed
photons (represented by the inp_type parameter that is equal to
0 for blackbody seed photons or to 1 for disk blackbody seed
photons), the temperature kTbb of the seed photons, the elec-
tron temperature kTe, an asymptotic power-law photon index Γ,
the redshift, as well as a normalisation constant. The absorption
that is due to the interstellar medium has been taken into ac-

count by using the TBabs model with the chemical abundances
of Asplund et al. (2009) and the cross-sections of Verner et al.
(1996). The energy domain of the spectrum, however, does not
enable us to well constrain the value of NH. As a consequence of
this, we ﬁx the column density of neutral hydrogen to the value
found by Parmar et al. (1989), which is also the highest avail-
able in literature. The ﬁt gives a χ2
red of 1.07 with 11 degrees of
freedom. The best-ﬁt parameters are shown in Tab. 5, while the
deconvolved model and the resulting residuals in unity of σ are
shown in Fig. 6.

5. Discussion

We estimated the orbital ephemeris of 4U 1323-619 using the
whole available X-ray archival data from 1985 to 2011. We pro-
duced the linear and quadratic orbital ephemerides, ﬁnding that
the value of the orbital period is 2.9419156(6) hrs. This is com-
patible with previous estimations (see Levine et al. 2011), but
with an accuracy that is ten times higher than that proposed by
Levine et al. (2011).
In a binary system the accretion of matter from the companion
star onto the neutron star is the main mechanism of generation
of radiation. The mass accretion rate, however, is governed by
the angular momentum losses to which the binary system is sub-
jected. The main channels of angular momentum loss are: the

A. F. Gambino et al.: New orbital ephemerides for the dipping source 4U 1323-619: constraining the distance to the source

mass loss from the binary system as a consequence of the accre-
tion, the generation of gravitational waves (especially in close
binaries composed by massive stars), and the magnetic braking,
which consists of a transfer of angular momentum from the com-
panion star to the ionised matter that surrounds it and that inter-
acts with its magnetic ﬁeld. The redistribution of the angular mo-
mentum induced by these interactions causes a variation of the
orbital period of the binary system. As a consequence of this, an
estimation of the orbital period derivative is important to under-
stand the orbital evolution of the system.
As a ﬁrst step towards the extrapolation of an evolutive scenario
for 4U 1323-619, we infer the companion star mass M2. Assum-
ing that 4U 1323-619 is a persistent X-ray source in a Roche
lobe overﬂow regime, as suggested by the long time monitoring
of the RXTE/ASM (see Fig. 7), then the companion star ﬁlls its
Roche lobe and, consequently, the companion star radius R2 is
equal to the Roche lobe radius RL2.
The Roche lobe radius is given by the expression

RL2 = 0.46224 a  m2

m1 + m2!1/3

(5)

,

(6)

= 0.877 m0.807

of Paczy´nski (1971), where m1 and m2 are the NS and compan-
ion star masses in units of solar masses and a is the orbital sep-
aration of the binary system. Assuming that the companion star
belongs to the lower main sequence, we adopt the relation
R2
R⊙
valid for M-stars (Neece 1984). Combining equations 5 and
6 with the third Kepler law and assuming a neutron star
(NS) mass of M1=1.4 M⊙ and the orbital period obtained
from our ephemeris, we ﬁnd that the companion star mass is
M2 ≃0.28±0.03 M⊙. Here we took into account an accuracy of
10% in the mass estimation (see Neece 1984). Our result is com-
patible with 0.25 M⊙, as suggested by Zolotukhin et al. (2010).
Since the companion star mass is 0.28 M⊙ we expect that it is
fully convective and, consequently, it cannot have a magnetic
ﬁeld anchored to it (Nelson & Rappaport 2003). This implies
that magnetic braking as a driving mechanism of the orbital evo-
lution is ruled out. Assuming that the unique mechanism of an-
gular momentum loss in this binary system is due to the gravi-
tational radiation and, considering a conservative mass transfer,
we can infer the secular mass accretion rate by re-arranging Eq.
10 of Burderi et al. (2010), i.e.

where ˙m−8 is the mass transfer rate from the companion star in
units of 10−8 M⊙ yr−1, q is the ratio of m2 to m1, and P2h is the
orbital period in units of two hours. The index n can assume the
values -1/3 or 0.8 and is associated with the internal structure of
the companion star. If the star is in thermal equilibrium, its index
n is 0.8 (the index of the mass-radius relation we adopted in Eq.
6) whilst it is equal to the adiabatic index n = −1/3 otherwise.
The values of ˙m predicted by Eq. 7 are 6.4×10−11 M⊙ yr−1 for
n=0.8 and 1.42×10−10 M⊙ yr−1 for n=-1/3.
Following the theory of secular evolution for X-ray binary sys-
tems, we can write the X-ray luminosity as

˙M the expression of
(see King 1988), where we substitute for
Eq. 7, and assume an NS radius R1 of 10 km. Since we need
to compare the predicted luminosity with the bolometric ob-
served luminosity, we extrapolate the 0.5-100 keV luminos-
ity from all the available observations. For some observations
the spectral analysis of the source was already shown in lit-
erature. Since the energy spectrum in this case is dominated
by a cut-oﬀ power-law component with a cut-oﬀ energy at 85
keV (Bałuci´nska-Church et al. 2009), we only use this spec-
tral component to extrapolate the unabsorbed luminosity, us-
ing the photon index and normalisation values reported in lit-
erature for each observation and ﬁxing the cut-oﬀ energy at 85
keV. We ﬁnd a ﬂux of 3.06×10−10, 3.61×10−10, 3.38×10−10,
and 3.62×10−10 erg cm2 s−1 for the observations taken by
Suzaku (Bałuci´nska-Church et al. 2009), EXOSAT (Parmar et al.
1989), BeppoSAX (Bałuci´nska-Church et al. 1999), and RXTE
(Galloway et al. 2008), respectively. On the other hand, we ex-
tract a ﬂux of 4.7×10−10 erg cm2 s−1 in the 0.5-100 keV energy
band from the XMM-Newton observation, and of 3.3×10−10 erg
cm2 s−1 from the JEM-X/ISGRI observation.
If we consider the 2-10 keV RXTE/ASM light curve spanning
15.5 years of data, from 3 March 1996 (10145 TJD) to 12
September 2011 (15816 TJD), we can observe that the source
maintained a roughly constant count-rate (see Fig. 7). Fitting the
ASM light curve with a constant function, in fact, we obtain a
count rate of (0.483±0.011) c s−1 with a χ2(d.o. f .) =5042(1388).
As a consequence of this, we estimate the mean ﬂux for 4U
1323-619, averaging all the values of ﬂux just obtained. The
mean value of ﬂux is of 3.6×10−10 erg cm2 s−1. To be more con-
servative, we veriﬁed that this result is not sensitive to the spe-
ciﬁc value of NH that was previously used for the JEM-X/ISGRI
ﬁt, which is the maximum available in literature. Adopting the
minimum value of NH available in literature (3.2×1022 cm−2;
Bałuci´nska-Church et al. 2009), we extract a ﬂux of 3.2×10−10
erg cm2 s−1 for the JEM-X/ISGRI observation in the 0.5-100
keV energy band. Again, we obtain a mean value of ﬂux of
3.6×10−10 erg cm2 s−1 averaging all the values of ﬂux obtained
above.
Using the mean ﬂux and adopting a distance of 10 kpc we de-
termine a mean luminosity of (4.3 ± 0.4)×1036 erg s−1 for 4U
1323-619. In this estimation, we took into account an arbitrary
error of 10%. We observe that the luminosity predicted by Eq.
8 can reach a maximum value of 1.7×1036 erg s−1 for n=-1/3,
and a value of 7.5×1035 erg s−1 for n=0.8. We show the mean
luminosity together with that predicted by Eq. 8 in the upper
panel of Fig. 8. From this comparison, we can conclude that,
for a distance of 10 kpc, the observed mean luminosity is not in
accordance with that predicted by the theory of the secular evo-
lution. We note that a wrong distance value could contribute to
the observed inconsistency.

For this purpose, we take into account the 3D extinction map
of the radiation in the Ks band for our Galaxy (Marshall et al.
2006). This map suggests how great the extinction of the radia-
tion is in the direction of the source (l = 307◦, b = 0.5◦) as a
function of the distance. In Fig. 9 we report the extinction pre-
dicted by the model of Marshall et al. (2006) as a function of the
distance from the source. We extrapolated the proﬁle, taking into
account the galactic coordinates of 4U 1323-619. We calculate
the visual extinction using the Güver & Özel (2009) relation
NH = (2.21 ± 0.09) × 1021AV ,
where NH is the equivalent column density of neutral hydrogen
of the absorbing interstellar matter and AV is the visual extinc-
tion of the source radiation. Using the NH value 3.2×1022 cm−2

found by Bałuci´nska-Church et al. (2009), we estimate a visual
extinction of AV =14.5±0.7 mag that is compatible with the value
found by Bałuci´nska-Church et al. (1999). The visual extinction
is related to the extinction of the radiation in the Ks band through
the relation

(Marshall et al. 2006).

(Nishiyama et al. 2008), where AKS is the extinction in the KS
band. With this relation we ﬁnd a value for the extinction of
AKS = 0.90±0.09 mag.
We ﬁtted the proﬁle of the extinction of Fig. 9 with a quadratic
function between 3 and 6 kpc, imposing a null value of the ex-
tinction for a null distance. The ﬁt gives us a χ2
red of 1.38 with
12 degrees of freedom, a linear parameter of 0.10± 0.02, and a
quadratic parameter of 0.028±0.004. The uncertainties are given
with a conﬁdence level of 68%. According to the value of AKS ,
obtained before, we estimate a distance of 4.2+0.8
−0.7 kpc with a con-
ﬁdence level of 68%. This distance is fully in agreement with the
value of distance suggested by Zolotukhin et al. (2010).
Taking into account a distance of 4.2+0.8
−0.7 kpc, we infer a lumi-
nosity of (0.8 ± 0.3)×1036 erg s−1 that is compatible with the
one predicted by Eq. 8 for a n index close to 0.8 and thus for a
thermal equilibrium state of the companion star (see Fig. 8).
A value of luminosity that completely matches the one predicted
by Eq. 8 for n=0.8 is obtained for a distance to the source of
d∼4.17 kpc. According to the Marshall et al. (2006) model (see
Fig. 9), an extinction of 0.88 mag competes for this value of
distance in the Ks band, and thus, by Eq. 10 and Eq. 9, we infer
Av=14.2 mag and NH ∼3.1×1022 cm−2. This value of NH is fully
in agreement with that obtained by Bałuci´nska-Church et al.
(2009).
We also explored a non-conservative mass transfer scenario. We
observe that in the case in which the mass is expelled from the
position of the companion star, for an index n=0.8 and a distance
from the source of 4.2 kpc, the luminosities obtained from the in-
dividual X-ray observations are compatible with the luminosity
predicted by a non-conservative mass transfer theory for a value
of β ≥ 0.8, where β is the fraction of matter accreted onto the
neutron star. This implies that the observations are in agreement
with a scenario in which more than the 80% of the mass is ac-
creted onto the neutron star. Thus, on the basis of the fact that

A. F. Gambino et al.: New orbital ephemerides for the dipping source 4U 1323-619: constraining the distance to the source

only the 20% of mass of the companion star is lost from the sys-
tem, we can conﬁrm that the mass accretion mechanism could
be rightly considered conservative.
To investigate the orbital evolution of the system, we need to
compare the Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale τKH (i.e. the charac-
teristic time to reach the thermal equilibrium for a star) with the
mass transfer time-scale τ ˙M. We calculate the Kelvin-Helmholtz
time-scale adopting the relation

τKH = 3.1 × 107  M2

of Verbunt (1993), together with the mass-luminosity relation for

(12)

of Neece (1984). Moreover, we assume the Neece (1984) mass-
radius relation of Eq. 6 for a main sequence M-type star in equi-
librium. Our estimation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale is of
τKH =9×108 yrs.
On the other hand, we extrapolate the mass transfer time-scale
using the relation

τ ˙M =

m2
˙m

=

,

(13)

where L is the source luminosity. To achieve this, we use the
mean luminosity estimated above during the ASM monitoring,
obtaining a mass transfer time-scale of 4.4×109 yrs. This value
is greater than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale by a factor of
4.9. This implies that the companion star is in thermal equilib-
rium and we can conclude that the mass-radius relation in Eq. 6
has been correctly used, suggesting that the proposed scenario is
self-consistent.
To understand how the binary system is going to evolve, we
estimate the orbital period derivative re-arranging Eq. 4 of
Burderi et al. (2010):

(14)

˙m−8 = 87.5 (3n − 1)−1m2  ˙P−10
P2h ! ,
where ˙P−10 is the orbital period derivative in units of 10−10
s/s and P2h is the orbital period of the system in units of two
hours. Adopting an index n=0.8, we obtain a value of the period
derivative of ˙P ∼ −5.4 × 10−14 s/s that is compatible with the
constraint on the ˙P, which is estimated from our ephemeris, i.e.
(0.8 ± 1.3) × 10−11 s/s. From this result, we can infer that the
orbital period is decreasing and that the system is shrinking as a
consequence of the orbits being Keplerian.

6. Conclusions

We constrain the X-ray source position of 4U 1323-619, ﬁnding
out that the source is located inside a circular area centred at RA
(J2000)= 201.6543◦ and DEC (J2000)= -62.1358◦ and with a ra-
dius of 0.0002◦ (that is 0.6"). This result allows us to conﬁrm the
suggestion of Zolotukhin et al. (2010) that the B source in Fig. 1
is the IR counterpart of 4U 1323-619.
In addition, using observations from 1985 to 2011, we infer for
the ﬁrst time the linear and quadratic orbital ephemerides for 4U
1323-619. We estimate the orbital period of the binary system
with an accuracy ten times higher than that which was proposed

by Levine et al. (2011). We obtain a reﬁned measure of the pe-
riod of P = 2.9419156(6) hrs, in line with previous estimates,
as reported in the literature. We infer for the ﬁrst time a weak
constraint on the orbital period derivative of the system that is of
˙P = (8 ± 13) × 10−12 s/s. Assuming a fully conservative mass-
transfer scenario and that the companion star is an M-type main-
sequence star, we estimate the mass of the companion to be of
0.28±0.03 M⊙. This result suggests that the star is fully convec-
tive and that the magnetic braking mechanism can be ruled out
as an explanation of angular momentum losses from the binary
system, which is therefore driven by the mechanism of gravita-
tional radiation.
We inferred that the companion star transfers matter onto the
neutron star surface via the inner Lagrangian point in a conser-
vative regime. According to the conservative mass-transfer sce-
nario, and taking into account the map of the Ks radiation ex-
tinction in our Galaxy, we estimate a distance of (4.2+0.8
−0.7) kpc at
68% conﬁdence level.
