abstract

According to the gauge/gravity duality conjecture, the thermodynamics of gauge theory
describing D-branes corresponds to that of black branes in superstring theory. We test
this conjecture directly in the case of D0-branes by applying Monte Carlo methods to the
corresponding gauge theory, which takes the form of the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics.
In particular, we take the continuum limit by extrapolating the UV cutoﬀ to inﬁnity. First
we perform simulations at large N so that string loop corrections can be neglected on
the gravity side. Our results for the internal energy exhibit the temperature dependence
consistent with the prediction including the α′ corrections. Next we perform simulations
at small N but at lower temperature so that the α′ corrections can be neglected on the
gravity side. Our results are consistent with the prediction including the leading string loop
correction, which suggests that the conjecture holds even at ﬁnite N.

Introduction

One of the most important directions in theoretical physics is to clarify the quantum nature
of gravity, which is crucial in understanding the beginning of our Universe and the ﬁnal
state of a black hole. Superstring theory is considered the most promising candidate of a
quantum gravity theory due to its UV ﬁniteness in striking contrast to the conventional
ﬁeld theoretical approach to quantum gravity, in which one faces with nonrenormalizable
UV divergences. So far, superstring theory is deﬁned only perturbatively around simple
backgrounds such as ﬂat spacetime, and it does not seem to be straightforwardly applicable
to the studies of a strongly gravitating spacetime such as the black hole geometry. However,
this diﬃculty has been partly surmounted by the discovery of D-branes [1]. Some extremal
black holes were constructed by combining diﬀerent kinds of D-branes, and the origin of
their entropy was understood by counting the microstates of the D-branes [2]. Also there
are several proposals for nonperturbative formulations of superstring theory based on super
Yang-Mills theory in low dimensions [3, 4, 5, 6].

In fact, it is conjectured that superstring theory on the anti-de Sitter background is dual
to four-dimensional N = 4 U(N) super Yang-Mills theory [7], which is realized on a stack of
N D3-branes. This duality has been generalized in various ways, and it is commonly referred
to as the gauge/gravity duality conjecture. The conjecture appears natural considering that
D-branes have two descriptions, one from a gravitational viewpoint, and the other from a
ﬁeld theoretical viewpoint. If this conjecture is true even in the presence of quantum eﬀects
on the gravity side, the quantum nature of gravity can be studied on a ﬁrm ground by
investigating the dual gauge theory.

Among various gauge/gravity duality conjectures that have been proposed so far, we
are interested in the one that has been studied most intensively, which claims that type
II superstring theory in the near horizon limit of the black p-brane geometry is equivalent
to a maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in (p + 1)-dimensions [7, 8]. The super
Yang-Mills theory is realized on N Dp-branes and it is characterized by the rank of the
gauge group N and the ’t Hooft coupling λ = g2
YMN. On the gravity side, N is the number
of black p-branes, and the ’t Hooft coupling is written as λ = (2π)p−2ℓp−3
gsN in terms of
the string coupling constant gs and the string length ℓs = α′1/2. The near horizon limit is
taken by α′ → 0 with λ and the energy scale U of the super Yang-Mills theory kept ﬁnite.
The above gauge/gravity duality has been tested in detail at N → ∞ and λ → ∞. In
this limit, superstring theory is well approximated by supergravity, which makes classical
analyses applicable. While the super Yang-Mills theory becomes strongly coupled in this
region, one can nevertheless extract the information of BPS states, which are protected by
supersymmetry, and conﬁrm the gauge/gravity duality in various ways.

s

A natural question to ask then is whether the gauge/gravity duality conjecture is valid
even for ﬁnite λ or ﬁnite N, or in a non-supersymmetric setup such as ﬁnite tempera-
ture. The analyses in these cases are quite diﬃcult, however, because the supergravity
approximation is no longer valid on the gravity side and we have to include α′ or gs cor-
rections. Furthermore, the lack of supersymmetry gives rise to all kinds of nonperturbative

2

corrections to physical quantities on the gauge theory side, which are too hard to handle
analytically.

The main purpose of this paper is to test the gauge/gravity duality conjecture for
ﬁnite N and λ at ﬁnite temperature. While it is not possible to calculate ﬁnite α′ or
gs corrections in superstring theory in general, the corrections to some physical quan-
tities can be extracted by taking account of higher derivative corrections to supergrav-
ity perturbatively. For instance, in the case of D0-branes, the internal energy including
the leading gs corrections has recently been evaluated analytically [9, 10]. On the other
hand, nonperturbative studies of the super Yang-Mills theory are possible by performing
Monte Carlo simulation. In the case of D0-branes, the super Yang-Mills theory takes the
form of matrix quantum mechanics for M theory [3, 11], which can be studied with rea-
sonable amount of computational eﬀort. In fact, several groups have studied this model
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and compared the obtained results
with the dual gravity predictions. In particular, ﬁnite λ corrections were investigated by
Monte Carlo simulation in refs. [16, 18] and more recently in refs. [24, 25], which raised
some controversies.
In this paper, we ﬁrst address this issue based on new calculation,
which improves our previous analysis [16, 18] by taking the continuum limit.

Then we investigate the 1/N corrections by simulating the same system at small N. This
turns out to be much more diﬃcult than the studies at large N because of the instability
associated with the ﬂat directions in the potential. The bound state of D0-branes is stable
at large N, but it becomes only meta-stable at suﬃciently low temperature for small N. We
extract the internal energy of the meta-stable bound states by introducing a cutoﬀ on the
extent of the D0-brane distribution, which is chosen in such a way that the obtained result
does not depend on it within a certain region. Our results obtained in this way turn out to
be consistent with the analytic result obtained on the gravity side including the leading gs
corrections. This suggests that the gauge/gravity duality holds even at ﬁnite N. In fact,
the instability at ﬁnite N can be understood also on the gravity side. Some of the results
are reported brieﬂy in our previous publication [21].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give an overview of the
black 0-brane thermodynamics, and discuss how ﬁnite λ and ﬁnite N corrections appear in
the internal energy of the D0-branes. In section 3 we explain how we study the D0-brane
quantum mechanics by Monte Carlo simulation. In section 4 we provide numerical tests of
the gauge/gravity duality including ﬁnite λ and ﬁnite N corrections. Section 5 is devoted
to a summary and discussions.

2 Brief review on the black 0-brane thermodynamics

In this section we brieﬂy review the thermodynamics of the black 0-brane in type IIA
superstring theory, which appears in the gauge/gravity duality we are going to test.
In
particular, we derive an expression for the quantity that should be compared with the
internal energy of the dual gauge theory calculable by Monte Carlo methods. Corresponding

3

to ﬁnite λ and ﬁnite N corrections on the gauge theory side, we need to consider how the
black 0-brane thermodynamics is aﬀected by the higher derivative corrections to the low-
energy eﬀective action of type IIA superstring theory.

2.1 The eﬀects of higher derivative corrections on the black 0-

brane thermodynamics

In the low energy limit, the scattering amplitudes of strings in type II superstring theory
can be reproduced correctly by the type II supergravity action. However, if we go beyond
the low energy limit, we have to take into account the eﬀects due to the ﬁnite length ℓs
of strings (α′ corrections) and the eﬀects of string loops (gs corrections). In general, these
eﬀects can be extracted by considering the scattering amplitudes of strings associated with
a Riemann surface with genus n and expanding them with respect to external momenta
[26, 27]. The number of external momenta in the expansion raises the power of α′, whereas
the genus n gives the power of g2
s. The corrections to the type II supergravity action due
to these eﬀects are represented by higher derivative terms, and they are organized in the
form of a double expansion with respect to α′ and gs. Below, we discuss some qualitative
features of the higher derivative terms in type IIA superstring theory.

Treating the type IIA superstring theory perturbatively with respect to two parameters

α′ = ℓ2

s and the dilaton coupling gseφ, one can write its eﬀective action formally as

with an overall coeﬃcient given by 2κ2
mass dimension 2 that appear in the type IIA supergravity action, and O(m,n) represents
higher derivative corrections with mass dimension (2m + 2). All these terms are written in
terms of the massless ﬁelds in the type IIA superstring theory such as the graviton gµν, the
dilaton φ and the R-R 1-form potential Cµ. The structure of the higher derivative terms
can be determined by explicit calculations of scattering amplitudes, which show that the ℓ6
s
and ℓ6
s terms appear as the leading corrections, respectively, at the tree level and at the
one-loop level. It is also known that these terms do not appear from higher loops. Thus we
only have terms in eq. (2.1) with m ≥ 3 for n = 0, 1 and with m > 3 for n ≥ 2 [28].

corrections. In order to solve the above equations of motion for the black 0-brane, we make

of Hi and F1 are ﬁxed by using the solution of E (0) = 0 which are asymptotically ﬂat,
and they involve two parameters r− and α. As we will see below, r− and α are related
to the mass and the charge of the black 0-brane. The subleading terms described by the
functions H (m,n)
can be obtained by solving eq. (2.2) order by order. Note that
the functions for (m, n) = (3, 0) and (m, n) = (3, 1) can be obtained independently of the
other unknowns since they are the leading corrections, respectively, at the tree level and at
the one-loop level.

2.2 Black 0-brane thermodynamics at large N

Let us ﬁrst consider the supergravity approximation, which is valid when the curvature
radius is large compared to ℓs and the eﬀective coupling gseφ is small. Neglecting higher
derivative corrections in eqs. (2.4) and (2.7), the temperature and the internal energy of
the black 0-brane are obtained as

corresponds to α → 0 and r7

using ˜Q = N/(ℓsgs) and (2.6). In that limit, the event horizon rH = r−α, the temperature
˜T and the internal energy ˜E all vanish as long as r− is kept ﬁnite.

bulk gravity. On the other hand, the parameter ˜U0 in (2.9) is proportional to the product
of the string tension 1/2πℓ2
s and the typical length rH, which represents the gauge boson
mass in the gauge theory. Therefore, ﬁxing ˜U0 in the limit corresponds to keeping the
energy scale of the dual gauge theory ﬁnite. Let us also mention that the limit (2.9) can

Since α → 0 and r− → 0, the near horizon limit may be regarded as a special case of the
near extremal limit, in which the temperature ˜T and the internal energy ˜E are kept ﬁnite.
In the near horizon limit, physical quantities can be expressed in terms of ˜U0 and λ.

where the second term comes from the leading α′ correction with (m, n) = (3, 0) and the
third term comes from the next-leading α′ correction with (m, n) = (5, 0). The absence of
c4,0 follows from some knowledge [28] on the structure of the eﬀective action (2.1). The
explicit values of the non-zero coeﬃcients cm,0 are not known so far, however.

In fact, the internal energy of the black 0-brane is aﬀected by the Hawking radiation,
which has not been taken into account in (2.7). However, the energy loss through the
Hawking radiation can be neglected in the near horizon limit, as we show in appendix A.
This is reasonable since the near horizon limit implies the near extremal limit as well.

2.3 Black 0-brane thermodynamics at ﬁnite N

Let us move on to the case with ﬁnite N. Since the eﬀective coupling gseφ given by (2.15)
can no longer be neglected, all the higher order terms in eqs. (2.4) and (2.7) remain. Using
(2.15), each dimensionless term in (2.4) and (2.7) behaves as

(2.18)

The coeﬃcients cm,n can be determined, in principle, by solving the equations of motion
(2.2) that can be derived from the explicit form of the eﬀective action (2.1). Using some
knowledge [28] on the structure of the eﬀective action (2.1), we have cm,1 6= 0 only for
m = 3, 6,· · · and cm,2 6= 0 only for m = 5, 6,· · · , etc..
In general, it is diﬃcult to obtain the higher derivative corrections in the eﬀective
action (2.1). There exists one exception, however, which is the leading correction at one
loop corresponding to (m, n) = (3, 1). In this case, the correction can be obtained [10] by
uplifting the black 0-brane solution to the M-wave solution in eleven dimensions, which is
purely geometrical. Since higher curvature corrections in eleven dimensions are well-known
[29, 30, 31, 32, 33], it is possible to derive the equations of motion and solve them. Using this
result, the internal energy including the leading 1/N 2 correction can be obtained explicitly
as [10]

3 D0-brane quantum mechanics

According to the gauge/gravity duality conjecture, the thermodynamics of the black 0-
brane corresponds to that of the gauge theory describing the D0-brane, which takes the
form of the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics. In order to investigate the thermodynamics,
we use the Euclidean time and compactify it with the periodicity β = 1/ ˜T . Then the action
of D0-brane quantum mechanics at ﬁnite temperature ˜T is given by

which can be obtained formally by dimensionally reducing the action of (9 + 1)d N = 1
U(N) super Yang-Mills theory to (0+1) dimension. We have introduced Xi(t) (i = 1,· · · , 9)

8

The ’t Hooft coupling λ = g2

and ψα(t) (α = 1,· · · , 16), which are bosonic and fermionic N × N Hermitian matrices,
respectively, and the covariant derivative Dt = ∂t − i [A(t), · ] is deﬁned using the U(N)
gauge ﬁeld A(t). The bosonic variables obey periodic boundary conditions Xi(t+β) = Xi(t),
A(t + β) = A(t), whereas the fermionic variables obey anti-periodic boundary conditions
ψα(t + β) = −ψα(t). The 16 × 16 matrices γi in (3.1) act on spinor indices and satisfy the
Euclidean Cliﬀord algebra {γi, γj} = 2δij.
YMN corresponds to λ deﬁned in (2.9) on the dual gravity
side. Since the coupling constant g2
YM in the action (3.1) has mass dimension 3, all dimen-
sionful quantities can be measured in units of λ as we did in (2.14). Note that the expansion
(2.20) is valid when T ≪ 1 and T − 21
10 ≪ N. In particular, the ﬁrst inequality implies that
λ should be large for ﬁxed temperature ˜T . This implies that we need to study the strong
coupling dynamics of the D0-brane quantum mechanics in order to test the gauge/gravity
duality. For that purpose, we apply Monte Carlo methods analogous to the ones used in
lattice QCD.

3.1 Putting the theory on a computer

In order to apply Monte Carlo methods, we have to put the D0-brane quantum mechan-
ics (3.1) on a computer. It is not possible to do it, however, respecting all the maximal
supersymmetry generated by 16 supercharges, which the theory has at zero temperature.
For instance, if one discretizes the time direction, one cannot maintain all the supersymme-
try, since successive supersymmetry transformations induce a translation in time direction,
which is broken by the discretization. The lack of exact symmetry in quantum ﬁeld theories
typically necessitates ﬁne tuning in taking the continuum limit due to UV divergences. This
does not occur, however, in the present case since the system is just a quantum mechanics,
which is UV ﬁnite. Here, instead of discretizing the time direction, we expand the functions
of t in Fourier modes and introduce a mode cutoﬀ Λ after ﬁxing the gauge symmetry [34].
Since the higher Fourier modes omitted in our calculations are suppressed by the kinetic
term, the approach to Λ = ∞ is expected to be fast.

We ﬁx the gauge symmetry by the static diagonal gauge

This constraint is needed to ﬁx the symmetry under large gauge transformations8. The

7In actual simulation, we replace the constraint by maxa(αa)−mina(αa) ≤ 2π. This is practically equiv-
alent to (3.3) unless αa is distributed in the whole region (3.3), which occurs only at very low temperature.
8The gauge transformation acts on the gauge ﬁeld as A(t) → Ω(t)−1A(t)Ω(t)+iΩ(t)−1∂tΩ(t), where Ω(t)
is an N × N unitary matrix which satisﬁes the periodic boundary condition Ω(t + β) = Ω(t). After taking
the static diagonal gauge, one still has to ﬁx the residual symmetry under large gauge transformations,
which correspond to Ω(t) = diag(e2πin1t/β,··· , e2πinN t/β) with n1,··· , nN being integers.

where PfM represents the Pfaﬃan of M, which is complex in general and is denoted
as PfM = |PfM| eiΓ. Since Monte Carlo simulation is applicable only when the path
integral has a positive semi-deﬁnite integrand, we omit the phase factor eiΓ and deﬁne the
expectation value of O(X, α) for the phase-quenched model as

Then, the expectation value with respect to the original theory (3.10) is given by

DO(X, α)Ephase−quenched ≡ R dX dαO(X, α)|PfM| e−Sb

(3.11)

(3.12)

When eiΓ ﬂuctuates rapidly in the simulation of the phase-quenched model, it is diﬃcult
to evaluate (3.12) since both the denominator and the numerator become very small, and
the number of conﬁgurations needed to obtain the ratio with suﬃcient accuracy becomes
huge. This technical problem is called the sign problem.

In the present system, however, it has been reported that the ﬂuctuation of eiΓ is strongly
suppressed at both high temperature and low temperature, and that it can be neglected
throughout the whole temperature region [23, 25]. This can be understood as follows. At
high temperature, the high temperature expansion becomes applicable [35], which implies
that the dynamics of X and α in the Pfaﬃan becomes perturbative. Therefore, the ﬂuctu-
ation of eiΓ becomes less important at high temperature. At low temperature, on the other
hand, the dynamics is dominated by the low momentum modes, for which the kinetic term
(the ﬁrst term) in (3.9) can be neglected. If we omit the kinetic term, we can show that the
Pfaﬃan becomes real. Thus, the eﬀects of eiΓ can be neglected also at low temperature,
which is supported by some numerical evidence [19]. In the present work, we simply omit
the phase factor eiΓ, and use (3.11) to calculate the VEV of observables. See appendix B
of ref. [19] for the details of our algorithm for Monte Carlo simulation.

Let us also comment on how we treat the zero modes. Note that the constant modes
Xi(t) = xi1N (xi ∈ R) of the trace part does not appear in the action (3.1). These modes
should be omitted in the path integral (3.10). We can extract these modes from a general
conﬁguration by

xi =

1

Nβ Z β

0

dt Tr(cid:0)Xi(t)(cid:1) .

(3.13)

In what follows, we assume that these zero modes are ﬁxed by the constraint xi = 0 for
i = 1,· · · , 9. In Monte Carlo simulation, even if we start from a conﬁguration satisfying
the constraint, xi can become nonzero as the simulation proceeds due to accumulation of
round-oﬀ errors. We avoid this by making a projection Xi(t) 7→ X ′

i(t) = Xi(t) − xi1N .

11

3.2 Calculation of the internal energy
The internal energy E = − ∂
using the formula

∂β ln Z of the D0-brane quantum mechanics can be calculated

E = −3T (cid:18)hSbi −

9

2n(2Λ + 1)N 2 − 1o(cid:19) ,

(3.14)

which can be obtained by adapting the one used in the lattice formulation [36] to the present
momentum cutoﬀ formulation. (See appendix C for the derivation.)

A peculiar aspect of the D0-brane quantum mechanics is that the action (3.1) has
ﬂat directions [Xi, Xj] = 0. These are lifted by quantum corrections in the case of the
bosonic model, in which fermionic degrees of freedom are omitted [37]. However, in the
supersymmetric model, the ﬂat directions are not lifted by quantum corrections due to
supersymmetry. As a result, the supersymmetric model contains scattering states, which
form the continuous branch of the energy spectrum, in addition to the normalizable energy
eigenstates, which form the discrete branch of the spectrum.10 Therefore, the path integral
(3.10) is ill-deﬁned as it stands, and we need to consider how to make sense out of it.

In the large-N limit, the path integral (3.10) becomes well-deﬁned analogously to the
well-known example of the Φ3 model [40]. In this case, we may naturally consider that the
well-deﬁned path integral (3.10) actually represents the thermodynamics of the normalizable
states only.

1

The situation becomes subtle at ﬁnite N. Suppose we prepare an initial state with
Xi ∼ 0 having suﬃciently low energy and let it evolve in time quantum mechanically.
It is expected from the Monte Carlo simulation discussed in section 4.2 that the size O =
N Tr(Xi)2 of the state ﬂuctuates for a while around some ﬁnite value depending on the initial
state, and eventually starts to diverge. These meta-stable states are linear combinations of
normalizable states and scattering states. However, if they are long-lived, we can still think
of their thermodynamics by introducing a cutoﬀ O ≤ R2
cut should be chosen to
be the typical size of the meta-stable states for a given energy. This can be achieved in the
path integral formalism by replacing the partition function (3.10) by

cut, where R2

10In ref. [38], the discrete branch of the spectrum is shown to have a new energy scale proportional to
N −5/9 based on the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the relevant O(N ) degrees of freedom in the ﬂat directions.
Based on this observation, the particular power “2.8” of the leading behavior in (2.16) has been understood
theoretically on the gauge theory side. See also ref. [39] for related work on supersymmetric models with
4 and 8 supercharges.

12

It is expected that the internal energy of the cutoﬀ system (3.15) becomes independent of
R2
cut within some region, and the internal energy obtained in that region can be interpreted
as the average internal energy of the meta-stable states for the T and N corresponding to the
partition function (3.15). The typical size of the meta-stable states can be identiﬁed with
the lower end of the region of R2
cut within which the internal energy is constant. Note that
the partition function (3.15) does not represent the thermodynamics of the normalizable
states only unlike the case with N = ∞. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the speciﬁc
heat C = dE
dT corresponding to the internal energy E deﬁned in this way becomes positive.
Since the N eigenvalues of Xi represent the position of the D0-branes, the meta-stable
states can be interpreted as the bound states of D0-branes, which form a black hole. There-
fore, it is expected that the internal energy deﬁned above corresponds to the internal energy
(2.20) of the black hole. Indeed the black hole is stable in the large-N limit, but it becomes
meta-stable at ﬁnite N due to quantum eﬀects corresponding to 1/N 2 corrections. This
can be seen in (2.19), for instance, where the leading 1/N 2 correction makes the speciﬁc
heat negative at suﬃciently low T . This instability can be understood physically as caused
by the repulsive force acting on a test particle near the event horizon due to the quantum
gravity eﬀects at small distances [9].

4 Numerical tests of the gauge/gravity duality

In this section we provide numerical tests of the gauge/gravity duality including ﬁnite λ and
ﬁnite N corrections, which correspond to the α′ and string loop corrections, respectively,
on the gravity side. These corrections are discussed separately in sections 4.1 and 4.2.

4.1 Test including α′ corrections

In this section we provide a test of the gauge/gravity duality in the large-N limit. For that
purpose, we perform Monte Carlo simulation of the D0-brane quantum mechanics (3.1) at
large N and compare the results with the prediction (2.16) obtained on the gravity side.
As long as N > Nc(T ), where Nc(T ) is some critical value depending on T , the instability
mentioned in the previous section does not show up practically during Monte Carlo simu-
lation, and we can calculate various observables by taking an average in a straightforward
manner. The critical value is found to behave as Nc(T ) ∼ 6/T at T & 0.5 [16], which makes
the lower T region diﬃcult to study.
In ref. [18], the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation with N ≤ 17 and Λ ≤ 8 were
compared with the prediction including α′ corrections. The numerical data were ﬁtted by
an ansatz E/N 2 = 7.41 T 2.8 + a T p with p = 4.58(3) and a = −5.55(7), which is consistent
with the prediction p = 4.6 from the gravity side. However, a recent paper [24] repeated the
analysis including data points at lower T with N = 32 using a lattice formulation.11 The

degrees of freedom.

extrapolation to Λ = ∞ with the constant ﬁt and the linear ﬁt. The constant ﬁt is performed
using the data within 6 ≤ Λ ≤ 8, whereas the linear ﬁt is performed by ﬁtting the data to
E/N 2 = a/Λ + b with the ﬁtting range 4 ≤ Λ ≤ 8 for T = 1.0, 5 ≤ Λ ≤ 8 for T = 0.9, 0.8
and 6 ≤ Λ ≤ 8 for T = 0.7, 0.6, 0.5.

values obtained from the same ﬁt was a = −0.90(26) × 10 and p = 4.74(35). In ref. [18], a
one-parameter ﬁt with the power p = 4.6 ﬁxed was also performed, and the coeﬃcient was
determined as a = −5.58(1).
In order to clarify this discrepancy, we improve our previous analysis in ref. [18] by
making extrapolations to Λ = ∞. In Fig. 1 (Left) we plot our results obtained for N = 16
against 1/Λ. We tried both a linear extrapolation E/N 2 = a + b/Λ and a constant ﬁt. The
values at each Λ and the values obtained by the extrapolations are given in Table 1 and 2,
respectively. In Fig. 1 (Right), we plot the internal energy obtained by the extrapolations.
The new results are consistent with the ﬁt E/N 2 = 7.41 T 2.8−5.58 T 4.6 obtained in ref. [18].
In Fig. 2 we plot the diﬀerence between the obtained internal energy and the leading
prediction (2.13) from supergravity. The diﬀerence is normalized by the leading prediction
as y = (7.41 T 2.8 − E/N 2)/7.41 T 2.8 and it is plotted against x = T 1.8. The leading α′
corrections correspond to a linear behavior towards the origin.
Indeed we see a linear
behavior for T ≤ 0.7 consistent with the ﬁt obtained in ref. [18]. On the other hand, the
subleading terms are expected to show up as y = a1x + a2x5/3 + a3x2 + a4x7/3 + · · · . The
solid line and the dashed line are ﬁts to y = a1x + a2x5/3 using the data points within the
range 0.5 ≤ T ≤ 0.7 and 0.5 ≤ T ≤ 0.9, respectively, obtained by the linear ﬁt. In the
latter case, the left-most data point obtained by the constant ﬁt is slightly oﬀ the ﬁtting

temperature as is suggested from the 1/N expansion (2.20). In order to decide which ﬁt is
more appropriate, we clearly need more data at lower temperature with larger N.

4.2 Test including string loop corrections

In this section we test the gauge/gravity duality including string loop corrections. For that
purpose, we need to study the D0-brane quantum mechanics at small N such as N = 3, 4, 5.
As is mentioned at the end of section 3.2, the system has instability at small N associated
with the ﬂat directions in the action. In order to probe the instability, we deﬁne

R2 ≡

Nβ Z β

dt

Xi=1

Tr(cid:0)Xi(t)2(cid:1) ,

(4.1)

which represents the extent of the eigenvalue distribution of Xi’s. In Monte Carlo simu-
lation, we prepare the initial conﬁguration of Xi(t) with small R2 by giving each element
a small Gaussian random number. At suﬃciently low T , we observe that R2 stabilizes as
the simulation proceeds, and ﬂuctuates around some value for a while and then starts to
diverge. This behavior motivates us to consider the partition function (3.15), where R2
is replaced by R2 for simplicity.12 What we do in practice is to add the potential term

max

V =(cid:26) c |R2 − R2

for R2 ≥ R2
for R2 < R2

cut ,
cut ,

to the action, where c and R2

cut are some parameters to be chosen appropriately.

Let us deﬁne the distribution of R2 by

(4.2)

(4.3)

ρ(x) =Dδ(R2 − x)E ,

where the expectation value is taken in the system with the potential (4.2). Figure 3
(Top-Left) shows the distribution ρ(x) obtained from Monte Carlo simulation with N = 4,
T = 0.10, Λ = 10, where we have set c = 100 and R2
cut = 4.2. There is a clear peak around
R2 ∼ 3.5, which indicates the existence of the meta-stable bound states. The long tail at
R2 & 4 represents the run-away behavior caused by the instability. In Fig. 3 (Top-Right)
we plot the internal energy E(x)/N 2 obtained by averaging only over conﬁgurations with
R2 < x for the same set of parameters. We see a clear plateau around x ∼ 4, which conﬁrms
the argument given in section 3.2. Practically, we deﬁne the internal energy of the bound
states by the local minimum of E(x)/N 2 in the plateau region.

The extent of the bound state can be identiﬁed as the lower end of the plateau region,
which we denote as xmin. In practice, we obtain the value of x, at which E(x)/N 2 deviates
from the local minimum by 5%, and similarly the value of x allowing 10% deviation. We use

the average of the two values as an estimate of xmin and the diﬀerence as an estimate of the
ambiguity (“error”). In Fig. 3 (Bottom) we plot xmin thus obtained as a function of T for
N = 4 and Λ = 16 together with the expectation value hR2i obtained from conﬁgurations
with R2 ≤ xmin. We observe that both xmin and hR2i increase as T is lowered. Note that
the quantity hR2i at large N can be obtained without such a cutoﬀ procedure, and it is a
monotonically increasing function of T . (See Fig. 2 of ref. [35], for instance.)
Using the method explained above, we calculate the internal energy of the bound states
for various N, T and Λ. We have studied 0.08 ≤ T ≤ 0.12 for N = 3, 0.07 ≤ T ≤ 0.12 for
N = 4 and 0.08 ≤ T ≤ 0.11 for N = 5. In Table 3, we present our results for the internal
energy obtained at each N, T and Λ. We make an extrapolation to Λ = ∞ assuming that
ﬁnite Λ corrections to the internal energy are given by E = Egauge + const./Λ, from which
we extract the value Egauge in the continuum limit. This extrapolation is performed using
8 ≤ Λ ≤ 16 for T ≥ 0.10 and 10 ≤ Λ ≤ 16 for T < 0.10. Figure 4 (Left) shows the case

Egauge/N 2 obtained from our results by extrapolation to Λ = ∞ is plotted against T . The
curves represent Egauge/N 2 = Egravity/N 2 + (c T −2.6 + ˜c T p)/N 4, where the parameters c, ˜c
and p are obtained by ﬁts as described at the end of section 4.2. The solid, dashed and
dash-dotted lines correspond to N = 5, 4 and 3, respectively.

of N = 4, T = 0.10. In Fig. 4 (Right), we plot our results for Egauge/N 2 obtained in the
continuum limit by extrapolation to Λ = ∞. (The explicit values are given in the right
most column of Table 3.) The curves in this plot are explained at the end of this section.
Let us compare our results with the prediction from the gravity side. Since the α′
corrections are negligible in the temperature regime investigated here, we can compare our
results with (2.19), which we denote as Egravity/N 2 in what follows. Let us also expand the
internal energy of the bound states obtained on the gauge theory side as

Egauge
N 2 = c0(T ) +

c1(T )
N 2 +

c2(T )
N 4 + · · · .

(4.4)

If the gauge/gravity duality holds, the ﬁrst and the second terms above should coincide
with those in (2.19), namely, c0(T ) = 7.41 T 14/5 and c1(T ) = −5.77 T 2/5. In other words,
the diﬀerence of the two quantities Egauge and Egravity should behave as

1
N 2 (Egauge − Egravity) =

c2(T )

N 4 + O(cid:18) 1

N 6(cid:19) .

(4.5)

In Fig. 5 (Left), we plot (Egauge − Egravity)/N 2 against 1/N 4, which can be nicely ﬁtted by a
straight line passing through the origin. We also observe a similar behavior for other values
of T . Thus, we conﬁrm the behavior (4.5), which implies that the gauge/gravity duality
holds including the leading quantum gravity correction. In Fig. 5 (Right), we plot Egauge/N 2
against 1/N 2, which can be ﬁtted nicely by Egauge/N 2 = 7.41 T 2.8−5.76 T 0.4/N 2+const./N 4
as expected from the gauge/gravity duality. On the other hand, we also ﬁnd that the

O(1/N 4) term is actually comparable to the O(1/N 2) term. This is related to the fact that
the coeﬃcient of the 1/N 4 term grows at low T as we see below.
As an alternative analysis, we ﬁt our results for each T with

Egauge/N 2 = 7.41T 2.8 + c1/N 2 + c2/N 4 ,

(4.6)

Let us also discuss the T dependence of c2.

where c1 and c2 are ﬁtting parameters. In Fig. 6, we plot the values of c1 obtained by the
two-parameter ﬁt as a function of T , which agree well with the behavior c1 = −5.76 T 0.4
expected from the gravity side.
In Fig. 6 (Right) we plot the value of
c2 obtained by ﬁtting our data to (4.6) with c1 = −5.76 T 0.4 ﬁxed. From the prediction
from the gravity side (2.18), we ﬁnd that c2 = c T −2.6 + · · · , where the leading behavior
is determined by the (m, n) = (5, 2) term in (2.18). We can actually ﬁt our results to
c2 = c T −2.6 + ˜c T p with c = 0.032(2), ˜c = 0.51(64) × 105 and p = 3.7(6), where the second
term ˜c T p is meant to represent all the subleading terms phenomenologically.13 Therefore we
consider that the T dependence of c2 is also consistent with the prediction from the gravity
side. The curves in Fig. 4 (Right) represent Egauge/N 2 = Egravity/N 2 + (c T −2.6 + ˜c T p)/N 4
with c, ˜c and p obtained above.

13The value for ˜c obtained by the ﬁt looks huge, but it is actually compensated by the high power of T

within the temperature region investigated here.

5 Summary and discussions

In this paper we have performed numerical tests of the gauge/gravity duality conjecture
including the α′ and string loop corrections by using N D0-branes at ﬁnite temperature.
On the gravity side, these are described by the black 0-brane geometry. The leading part is
obtained by the supergravity solution, and the α′ and string loop corrections can be taken
into account perturbatively, which leads to the internal energy of the black 0-brane given by
eq. (2.20). On the gauge theory side, the D0-branes are described by the matrix quantum
mechanics, which has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation.

In the large-N limit, the string loop corrections can be neglected on the gravity side
and the internal energy is given by eq. (2.16). We have improved our previous analysis in
ref. [18] by performing extrapolations to the continuum limit. While our new results are
still consistent with the ﬁt obtained previously, we have also suggested an alternative ﬁt
obtained by taking into account the higher order α′ corrections. More calculations at low
temperature with larger N are required for a deﬁnite conclusion to be reached.

We have also provided a test of the gauge/gravity duality including string loop correc-
tions. In order to see the string loop corrections, we need to study the D0-brane system
with small N such as N = 3, 4, 5. This is diﬃcult because of the instability associated with
the ﬂat directions of the potential. At low temperature, however, we observe from Monte
Carlo simulations that the bound states of D0-branes become meta-stable. We investigate
the thermodynamics of these meta-stable bound states by introducing a cutoﬀ on the ex-
tent of the D0-branes. Indeed we ﬁnd that the internal energy becomes independent of the
cutoﬀ within a ﬁnite region. From this behavior, we were able to obtain the internal energy
of the meta-stable bound states as a function of the temperature, which turns out to be
consistent with the result (2.19) obtained recently on the gravity side including the leading
string loop corrections. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst dynamical evidence that suggests
that the gauge/gravity duality holds at ﬁnite N. (See ref. [41] for studies on kinematical
aspects of the duality including 1/N corrections.)

A particularly interesting future direction would be to investigate the D0-brane system
at even lower temperature with larger N. On the gravity side, it is expected that the black 0-
brane geometry becomes unstable, and undergoes a transition to a black hole moving along
the eleventh direction [8] due to the Gregory-Laﬂamme instability [42]. This corresponds
to a Schwarzschild black hole in eleven dimensions, where the Hawking radiation becomes a
non-negligible eﬀect unlike the case investigated in this paper. The transition temperature
has been obtained as Tc = 0.574N −5/9 + 0.707N −11/9 + · · · including the leading quantum

be able to investigate the conjecture that the same matrix quantum mechanics actually
describes M theory nonperturbatively [3].

A Hawking radiation in type IIA supergravity

The internal energy of the black 0-brane is aﬀected by the Hawking radiation. In order to
estimate the strength of this eﬀect, we consider the Stefan-Boltzmann law in 10-dimensional
spacetime

Since the coeﬃcient vanishes in the ℓs → 0 limit, the energy loss through the Hawking
radiation can be neglected in the present calculation. This conclusion is understandable
since the near horizon limit corresponds to a particular case of the near extremal limit as
we mentioned below eq. (2.10).

B Leading higher derivative corrections at one loop

In this appendix, we brieﬂy review the derivation [10] of the internal energy (2.19) including
the leading higher derivative correction at the one-loop level, which corresponds to the
(m, n) = (3, 1) term in the eﬀective action (2.1).

C Derivation of the formula for the internal energy

by Monte Carlo simulation. Let us ﬁrst rewrite the internal energy E = − ∂

∂β ln Z as

E = −

where β′ = β + ∆β, and represent Z(β′) for later convenience as

Z(β′) =Z [DA′]β ′[DX ′]β ′[Dψ′]β ′ e−S ′

,

(C.1)

(C.2)

where S′ is obtained from S given in (3.1) by replacing β, t, A(t), Xi(t), ψα(t) with β′, t′,
A′(t′), X ′

α(t′). In order to relate Z(β′) to Z(β), we consider the transformation

where the constant factors are motivated on dimensional grounds. As for the path integral
measure, we impose [DX ′]β ′ = [DX]β, [Dψ′]β ′ = [Dψ]β and [DA′]β ′ = [DA]β, which corre-
sponds to subtracting the internal energy for the free theory in the deﬁnition (C.1). Under
this transformation, the kinetic term in S′ reduces to that in S, but the interaction term
transforms non-trivially as

where Sb,int and Sf,int represent the bosonic and fermionic part of the interaction terms,
respectively. Plugging these into (C.1), we get

2hSf,inti(cid:19) .

(C.7)

Thus we are able to express the internal energy E in terms of the expectation values,
which can be calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. However, the second term hSf,inti
is computationally demanding since it involves fermionic matrices. This motivates us to
rewrite it in terms of quantities involving bosonic matrices only.

For that purpose, we consider a change of variables Xi(t) 7→ eǫXi(t) in the partition
function. The kinetic term Sb,kin for the bosonic matrices Xi(t) in (3.1) transforms as
Sb,kin 7→ e2ǫSb,kin, whereas the interaction terms transform as Sb,int 7→ e4ǫSb,int and Sf,int 7→
eǫSf,int. The path integral measure for the bosonic matrices Xi(t) transforms as dX 7→
e9ǫ{N 2(2Λ+1)−1}dX, where the “−1” is due to the fact that the trace part in the constant
mode of Xi(t) does not appear in the action and hence should be omitted. Since the
partition function should be invariant under the change of variables, we obtain the identity

9{N 2(2Λ + 1) − 1} = 2hSb,kini + 4hSb,inti + hSf,inti .

(C.8)

Solving this equation for hSf,inti, and plugging it into (C.7), we obtain the formula (3.14).
When we add the potential (4.2) to the action, the formula (3.14) is modiﬁed by an
extra term coming from the potential. However, in the parameter region investigated in

25

this work, the extra term turns out to be negligible as we brieﬂy discuss below. For this
reason, we use the formula (3.14) with or without the potential (4.2).

For simplicity, we consider introducing the constraint R2 ≤ R2

cut, which corresponds to
cut − R2) in the integrand of the path integral (3.10). Under

inserting an extra factor θ(R2
the transformation (C.3), R2 deﬁned in (4.1) transforms as
