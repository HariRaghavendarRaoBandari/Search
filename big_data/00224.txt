Based on the basic deﬁnition of Fermi energy of degenerate and relativistic electrons,
we obtain a special solution to electron Fermi energy, EF(e), and express EF(e) as a
function of electron fraction, Ye, and matter density, ρ. Several useful analytical formulae
for Ye and ρ within classical models and the work of Dutra et al. 2014 (Type-2) in
relativistic mean ﬁeld theory are obtained using numerically ﬁtting. When describing the
mean-ﬁeld Lagrangian, density, we adopt the TMA parameter set, which is remarkably
consistent with with the updated astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Due to the

importance of the density dependence of the symmetry energy, S, in nuclear astrophysics,
a brief discussion on the symmetry parameters Sv and L (the slope of S) is presented.
Combining these ﬁt formulae with boundary conditions for diﬀerent density regions, we
can evaluate the value of EF(e) in any given matter density, and obtain a schematic
diagram of EF(e) as a continuous function of ρ. Compared with previous study on the
electron Fermi energy in other models, our methods of calculating EF(e) are more simple
and convenient, and can be universally suitable for the relativistic electron regions in the
circumstances of common neutron stars. We have deduced a general expression of EF(e)
and ne, which could be used to indirectly test whether one EoS of a NS is correct in our
future studies on neutron star matter properties. Since URCA reactions are expected
in the center of a massive star due to high-value electron Fermi energy and electron
fraction, this study could be useful in the future studies on the NS thermal evolution.

Keywords: Neutron star; equation of state; electron Fermi energy

1. Introduction

Pulsars are among the most mysterious objects in the universe that provide natural
laboratory for investigating the nature of matter under extreme conditions, and are
universally recognized as normal neutron stars (NSs), but sometimes have been
argued to be quark stars1,2,3 . The equation of state (EoS) of matter under exotic
conditions is an important tool for the understanding of the nuclear force and for
astrophysical applications. The Fermi energy of relativistic electrons EF(e) is one of
most important and indispensable physical parameters in the EoS, and varies with
matter density ρ. The electron Fermi energy inﬂuences directly weak-interaction
processes including modiﬁed URCA reactions4, electron capture5,6,7,8,9 and so on,
in the circumstance of a NS. These inﬂuences will change intrinsic EoS, interior
structure and heat evolution, and even aﬀect the whole properties of the star.

Another important physical parameter aﬀecting internal properties of a NS is
the electron fraction, which is deﬁned as Ye = ne/nB (ne and nB are the electron
number density, baryon number density, respectively, and varies with the high-
density star matter. The value of average electron fraction is about 0.05 for a
common NS4,10. However, to exactly calculate the values of Ye for the neutron star
matter has long been a very challenging task for both the nuclear physics and the
astrophysics community11 due to some uncertainties and artiﬁcial assumptions in
studying structures and properties of NSs. Currently, our knowledge of the electron
fraction mainly comes from the model-dependence EoSs of NSs. For the β- equili-
brated NS matter we have free neutron decay n → p + e− + νe, which are governed
by weak interaction and the electron capture process p+ e− → n+ νe. Both types of
reactions alter Ye, and thus aﬀect the EoS. However, in the currently popular and
reliable EoSs of NSs, neutrinos generated in these reactions are always assumed to
leave the system. The absence of neutrino surely has some inﬂuence on the EoS
and mainly induces a signiﬁcant change on the value of Ye.

As we know, for degenerate and relativistic electrons in β−equilibrium, the
distribution function f (Ee) obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics: f (Ee) = 1/(Exp((Ee −
µe)/kT ) + 1), k represents Boltzmann’s constant, and µe is the electron chemical

potential. If T → 0, µe is also called the electron Fermi energy, EF(e), which
presents the energy of highest occupied states for electrons. The electron Fermi
energy EF(e) has the simple form

ec4(cid:1)1/2
with pF(e) being the electron Fermi momentum. The isoenergetic surface of E =
EF(e) is called the electron Fermi surface12,13,14.

EF(e) = (cid:0)p2

,

In the context of general relativity principle, the matter density is deﬁned as:
ρ = ε/c2, ε is the total energy density, including the rest-mass energies of particles.
Using the basic thermodynamics, we obtain the relation of the total matter pressure
P and matter density ρ in a common NS,

P (nB) = n2
B

,

ρ(nB) = ε(nB)/c2, ⇒ P = P (ρ) .

(2)

From the above equation, it is obvious that P solely depends on ρ. Theoretically,
we can obtain the value of EF(e) by solving EOS in a speciﬁc matter model. In this
paper, we mainly focus on EF(e) and Ye for degenerate and relativistic electrons
inside a common NS, where the magnetic eﬀects on the EoS are ignored.

This paper is arranged as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy review the structure of a
NS. In Sec. 3, we deduce a special solution to EF(e). We apply the special solution
obtained to numerically simulate EF(e) and Ye of a NS within classical models in
Sec. 4, and within the work of Dutra et al. 201415 in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6 we present
comparisons and discussions. The conclusion is presented in Sec.7.

2. Reviewing A NS’ Structure

The structure of a NS includes an atmosphere and four main internal regions: the
outer crust, inner crust, outer core, and inner core. The atmosphere is a thin layer
of plasma which determines the spectrum of thermal electromagnetic radiation of
the star. The geometrical depth of the atmosphere varies from some ten centimeters
in a hot star down to some millimeters in a cold one.

The knowledge of structures and properties of the crust plays an important
role in understanding many astrophysical observations16,17,18,19. The outer crust
consists of nuclei in a Coulomb lattice and electron gas, and has a depth of a few
hundred meters. At ρ ≤ 104 g cm−3, the electron gas may be non-degenerate, and
the ionization may be incomplete; at ρ < 107 g cm−3, the ground state may be
26F e; at ρ ∼ 109 g cm−3, the nuclei capture electrons and become neutron-rich,
56
and at the neutron drip density ρd, the neutrons start to drip from the nuclei and
form a free neutron gas. The neutron drip density ρd is well determined20,21 to be
about 4.3 × 1011 g cm−3.

The inner crust of a NS spans the region from the neutron drip point to the inner
edge separating the solid crust from the liquid core, and has several kilometers deep.

March 2, 2016 1:35 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

LiXH2015y2

The matter of the inner crust in nuclear equilibrium consists of neutron-rich nuclei
in a Coulomb lattice, electrons, and free neutrons. As matter density increases, free
neutrons supply an increasingly large fraction of the total matter pressure P . At
the crust-core transition density, ρt, the baryon number density reaches a critical
value, and nuclei dissolve and merge together.

The outer core consists of neutrons, protons and electrons (hereinafter “npe
system”), spans a density range of about 0.5ρ0 ∼ 2.5ρ0, and has a depth of several
kilometers, ρ0 = 2.8×1014 g cm−3 is the standard nuclear density. At the inner edge
of the outer core small fraction of muons (µ) may appear4, because the electron
Fermi energy could exceed the muon rest-mass energy mµc2 = 105.7 MeV. However,
a deﬁnite boundary between the outer core and inner core has not yet been obtained
due to the uncertainty of crust-core transition density.

The inner core is about several kilometers in radius, and has a central density as
high as ∼ 1015 g cm−3. With still further increase of density, the inner core becomes
energetically more economic if some nucleons transform to exotic particles such as
hyperons, pion condensates, kaon condensates and quarks, etc., when ρ > ρtr,
22. The
here ρtr is the transition density to these exotic particles, which is ∼ 4ρ0
maximum of the inner core density could exceed this transition density, so hyperons,
pion condensates, kaon condensates, quarks and nucleons with large Ye are expected
to exist in the inner core of a NS.

3. Electron Fermi Energy And Its Special Solution

3.1. General relation of EF(e), Ye and ρ

In the interior of a common NS with B ∼ 1010 − 1012 G, the isoenergetic surface
of degenerate and relativistic electrons is a spherical surface, and the microscopic
state number of electrons in a unit volume, Npha, is calculated by

Npha = ne =

F(e).

(3)

where h is Plank’s constant. For the convenience of calculations, we introduce a di-
mensionless momentum of electrons, xe = pF(e)/mec. According to Paulis exclusion
principle, the electron number density is equal to its microscopic state density,

ne = Npha =

where λe = h/mec = 2.4263 × 10−10 cm is the electron Compton wavelength. The
average mass of a baryon mB is deﬁned as

the baryon number of species i. In the interior of a NS, the relation of

Combining Eq.(5) with Eq.(6), we get

The expression above is a general formula for the electron Fermi energy, which is ap-
proximately suitable for relativistic electron matter regions (ρ ≥ 8.6 × 106 g cm−3)
in the whole interior of a common NS. If xe = pe/mec ≫ 1, Eq.(10) can be approx-
imately reduced as EF(e) ≈ 5.16 × 10−3(ρYe)

3.2. Special solution to EF(e)

In this part, in order to obtain a special solution to EF(e), we consider an ideal
n − p − e system under β-equilibrium in the outer core, where electrons are rela-
tivistic, neutrons and protons are non-relativistic. According to Shapiro & eukolsky
(1983)10 (hereinafter “ST-83”), when ρ ≫ 1013 g cm−3, the neutron pressure dom-
inates in the interior of a NS, and ρ ≈ mnnn, then the neutron number density
nn = 1.7 × 1038(ρ/ρ0) cm−3, the charge neutrality requires the proton number
density np = ne = 9.6 × 1035(ρ/ρ0)2 cm−3; β-equilibrium implies momentum con-
servation of pF(p) = pF(e) = 60(ρ/ρ0)2/3 MeV/c), thus the electron Fermi energy

EF(e) = 60(ρ/ρ0)2/3 MeV,

(11)

where pF(p) is the proton Fermi momentum. A simple proof of Eq.(11) is presented
as follows: From the relations of np, ne and nn above, we get

Ye = Yp ≈

≈ 0.005647 × (

where Yp is the proton fraction. Combining Eq.(12) with Eq.(10), we get

The above proof indicates that Eq.(10) is an accurate expression. Inserting Eq.(12)

(14)

The equation above is a special solution to EF(e), which is suitable relativistic
electron matter region of a common NS.

3.3. Test the validity of the special solution

To test the validity of the special solution to EF(e), we will calculate the values of
EF(e) in the work of Baym, Bethe & Pethick (1971)23 (hereinafter “BBP model”)
by using Eq.(14), and will compare our results with those of BBP model. By intro-
ducing a compressible liquid drop model of nuclei, BBP model is more successful
than other models in describing matter in the inner crust, where the system becomes
a mixture of nuclei, free neutrons, and electrons. According to BBP model23, the
total energy density ε and the total matter pressure P of the system are described
by

ε = εe(ne) + nN (WN + WL) + nn(1 − VN nN )Wn ,
P = Pn + Pe + PL

(15)

where nn is the number density of neutrons outside of nuclei (hereinafter “neutron
gas”), and the new feature is the dependence on the volume of a nucleus VN ,
which decreases with the outside pressure of the neutron gas; Pn, Pe and PL are
the neutron gas pressure, electron pressure, and lattice pressure, respectively. The
baryon number density in this model is

nB = AnN + (1 − VN nN )nn

,

(16)

where VN nN and 1 − VN nN are the fraction of volume occupied by nuclei, and the
fraction occupied by neutron gas, respectively. Then EF(e) is determined by

EF(e) =

∂εe
∂ne

=

∂
∂ne

(neEe) = −

(EN + EL).

(17)

The values of EF(e) in BBP model are partly listed in Table 1. The sign ‘†’ denotes
that ρm is the maximum equilibrium density at which the nuclide is present. The
data of columns 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 are cited from Table 2 of Canuto (1974)24. The

In Table 1 the magnitude of | E

calculations are consistent with those of BBP23. From the comparison above, our
method of calculating EF(e) is more simple and convenient than that in BBP model.

Be noted that, as a representative model, BBP model is arbitrarily selected to test
the validity of the speciﬁc solution to EF(e). In this part, other matter models will
no longer be enumerated, due to the restriction of space.

4. Numerically Simulating EF(e) and Y e in A NS (I)

In this Section, we will numerically ﬁt the relation of Ye and ρ in the whole interior of
a NS, according to several reliable EoSs within simple but classical matter models.
Combining the analytic expressions of Ye and ρ with the special solution to EF(e),
we will obtain schematic diagrams of EF(e) vs. ρ in diﬀerent density regions for
relativistic electrons.

4.1. Numerically ﬁtting in the outer crust
By introducing the lattice energy, Baym, Pethick & Sutherland (1971)20 (here-
after “BPS model”) improved on Salpeter’s treatment25, and described the nuclear
composition and EoS for catalyzed matter in complete thermodynamic equilibrium
below ρd. BPS model is one of most successful models describing matter of the
outer crust. According to BPS model, the total energy density ε and the total
matter pressure P are described by

ε = εN + εe + εL,

εL,

(18)

where εN is the energy density of nucleus, εe the energy density of free electrons,
and εL the bcc Coulomb lattice energy in a unit volume. The value of EF(e) is
obtained by solving the following diﬀerential equation,

EF(e) = µe =

Be note that the relation of Ye = Yp = Z/A always approximately holds in BPS
model. From Table 2, it’s obvious that Ye decreases with ρ. Combining Eq.(20) with
the special solution, we plot the diagram of EF(e) and ρ, and compare our results
with those in BPS model. From Fig. 1(b), it’s obvious that EF(e) increases with
ρ in BPS model. Theoretically, employing Eq.(20), we can obtain an approximate
value of EF(e), given a matter density of the outer crust.

4.2. Numerically ﬁtting in the inner crust

The uncertainty of crust-core transition density mainly comes from limited knowl-
edge of EoS, especially the density-dependence symmetry energy of neutron-rich
nuclear matter 26,27. Employing the method of quantum mechanics, Negele & Vau-
therin (1973)28(hereinafter “NV model”) ﬁrstly obtained the value of ρt ∼ 1.32 ×
1014 g cm−3. Recently, Atta & Basu (2014) obtained the value of 1.54×1014 g cm−3
(orρt ∼ 0.0938 fm−3) in the M 3Y nucleon-nucleon eﬀective interaction model29.

Fig. 2. The diagram of Ye vs. Log10ρ in the lower density region in the inner crust. The range
of ρ is (4.3×1011 ∼ 6.25 × 1012) g cm−3; Dot-dashed lines is the ﬁtting curve, and circles denote
the values of Ye and ρ for each individual nuclide in BBP model.

However, Atta & Basu (2014)29 obtained Ye ∼ 0.031, which is very close to the
value Ye ∼ 0.032 in NV model28.

Here we select ρd = 4.3 × 1011 g cm −3, corresponding to Ye ≈ 0.3051 and
EF(e) ≈ 26.2 MeV, in BPS model, and select ρt = 1.32 × 1014 g cm−3 in NV
model. Since the nuclei have dissolved by merging together at the base of the inner
crust, the matter begins to turn into an ideal npe system. From ST-83, we obtain
Ye ≈ 0.0026 and EF(e) ≈ 36.3 MeV at ρ = ρt.

Although the EoS above ρd is reasonably well understood by BBP model, this
model in a higher density region ρ ≥ 1.72 × 1014 g cm−3 was criticized by some
authors24,10,13, due to a monotonic and arbitrary increase of Z with A, which
causes the relation of P and ρ to be changed not much. Thus, we stop listing related
calculations in the higher density region. For convenience, the inner crust can be
roughly divided into two regions: a lower density region, and a higher density region.
The matter in the lower density region is still described by BBP model, whereas
matter in the higher density region is described by an ideal mixed model(hereinafter
“IM model”). With respect to IM model, our main hypotheses are as follows:

(1) Though matter in IM model is also a mixture of nuclei, free neutrons and free
electron gas, the details of nucleon-nucleon interactions may be ignored, due to

March 2, 2016 1:35 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

LiXH2015y2

10 Xing Hu Li, Zhi Fu Gao, Xiang Dong Li, Yan Xu, Pei Wang, and Na Wang

the uncertainty of nuclei compositions in IM model.

(2) The matter in IM model distributes in a range of ∼ 1012 ∼ 1.32 × 1014 g cm−3,

EF(e) grows with ρ smoothly, but the growth is not two much.

(3) Nuclei in IM model are more neutron-rich, and thus the values of Ye are uni-

versally smaller than those in BBP model, given the same matter densities.

(4) The electron fraction steadily decreases with matter density until ρ = ρt. To
insure that EF(e) increases with ρ, and Ye decrease with ρ in IM model, the
initial density of IM model, ρIM, should be 1.0 × 1013 g cm−3, we arbitrarily
select ρm = 6.25 × 1012 g cm−3 for ground state nucleus 170
48 Cd in BBP model
to be ρIM for IM model.

Based on Table 1, we plot a diagram of Ye and ρ in the lower density region of
the inner crust, as shown in Fig. 2. By numerically ﬁtting, we obtain an analytical
expression of Ye and ρ,

Ye = 0.0164 − 214.87e−Log10ρ + 3.67 × 109e−2Log10ρ.

(20)

in the range of 4.3×1011 ∼ 6.25 × 1012 g cm−3. Due to lack of a detailed infor-
mation on IM model introduced by this work, we cannot give an exact formula of
Ye and ρ for the higher density region. However, we mainly focus on the special
solution to EF(e) and its potential applications. We assume that EF(e) grows with
ρ exponentially, and the expression of EF(e) and ρ has a simple exponential form,

EF(e) = A + BeLog10ρ MeV,

(21)

in the higher density region. Employing the boundary conditions: (1) ρ = ρIM =
6.25 × 1012 g cm−3, Ye ≈ 0.0439, EF(e) ≈ 33.43 MeV, (2) ρ = ρt = 1.32 ×
1012 g cm−3, Ye ≈ 0.0026, EF(e) ≈ 36.3 MeV, we obtain the values of two constants,
A = 32.4 and B = 2.882 × 10−6. Combining the special solution of Eq.(14) with
Eq.(22), we obtain an analytical formula,

Ye ≈ 0.005647(

ρ0
ρ

)(0.539 + 4.803 × 10−8eLog10ρ)3,

(22)

in the higher density region. The relations of Ye and ρ, and EF(e) and ρ in the
inner crust are shown in Fig.3.

In addition, we calculate the values of EF(e) and Ye in IM model , as listed in
column 4 and column 5 of Table 3, respectively. The data of columns 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
and 8 are cited from Table 1 in this paper. The data of columns 4, 5, 9 and 10 are
obtained from IM model using Eq.(14) and Eq.(24). From Table 3, IM model may
be superior to BBP model in the higher density region.

4.3. Numerically ﬁtting in the outer core

The numerical simulations in the outer core are usually subject to two distinct
uncertainties:(1) determining the nuclear potential for nucleon-nucleon interaction,
and (2) ﬁnding an appropriate technique for solving the many-body problem. The

As mentioned in Section 3.2, the matter in the outer core contains relativistic
electrons, non-relativistic neutrons, and non-relativistic protons. Here, for the sake
of simplicity, we consider a homogenous ideal npe system under β-equilibrium, and
adopt ST-83 approximation10) as the main method to treat EoS of this system.

trons and muons under β-equilibrium. Here our ﬁrst aim is to deduce an analytical
expression of Ye and ρ in the inner core. A detailed deduction is summarized as
follows:

When EF(e) is high enough, it is energetically favorable for electrons to turn
into muons, so that muons and electrons are in equilibrium: µ− ↔ e−, here we
have as usual assumed that the neutrinos leave the system. Once we know this
equilibrium, thermodynamics does not require us to know any detail of the process
of µ− ↔ e−. Chemical potential equilibrium and charge neutrality give

schematic diagram of Ye and xe in the inner core of a NS. From Fig. 5, it’s obvious
that Ye increases with xe in the inner core of a NS.

The threshold density for muons to appear, ρµ, is also an important issue. When
at ρµ, nµ = 0 that is xµ = 0. Since the electrons are highly relativistic, we can take
xe ≫ 1, Eq.(24) becomes

than 1015 g cm−3), the composition is expected to include an appreciable number
of hyperons, and the nucleon interactions must be treated relativistically. In a real
scenario, matter in the inner core could be more complicated than that of ideal

and ρ. Right, the relation of EF(e) and ρ.

(1) Firstly, in the previous studies, there are too many matter models, some of
which are rather successful and thus representative. By solving the EoSs of these
models (including the above models), we can obtain the relations of EF(e) vs. ρ
and Ye vs. ρ. However, there still exist limitations for each EoS to some extent.
For example, any EoS has a certain application range of matter density, the
resulting values of EF(e) and Ye will deviate from those in the actual scenario
if the EoS is beyond of its application range of density.

(2) Secondly, up to now, we have not obtained a uniform EoS of one certain matter
model, which is excellent in describing the relations of EF(e), Ye and ρ in the
whole interior of a NS. By numerically simulating, we have obtained a set of
analytical expressions for EF(e), Ye and ρ from EoSs. However, this is not our
main purpose. Our ultimate aim is to investigate the whole variation trends in
Ye vs. ρ and EF(e) vs. ρ in the whole relativistic electron matter region of a
NS using these analytical expressions obtained.

(3) Thirdly, as we know, the electron Fermi energy, as well as the electron pressure,
is always continuous in the interior of a NS. From the general formula for
EF(e) (see Eq.(10)), Ye is also a continuous function of ρ in a NS. Utilizing the
boundary conditions and the ﬁtting formula of EF(e), Ye and ρ in four matter

15

regions (the outer crust, inner crust, outer core, and inner core), we obtain the
values of EF(e) and Ye, which are smooth and continuous functions of matter
density, as well shown in Fig.7.

(4) At last, we can see that the electron fraction Ye ﬁrstly decreases in the crust,
then increases in the core (from Fig.7(a)). The decrease in Ye is caused by
increasing neutronization of nuclei, as the depths of the crust increases, whereas
the increase in Ye is due to the fact that, the proton fraction Yp always increases
with the core matter density required by the chemical potential equilibrium
under β− equilibrium, and the charge neutrality gives np = ne + nµ. Be note
that nµ is far less than ne given a matter density. From Fig.7(b), the electron
Fermi energy always increases with matter density, the reason for the increase
in EF(e) is that EF(e) solely depends on ne, which always increases with ρ (for
details see in Sec.6.)

It should be admitted that our method of ﬁtting Ye and EF(e) is somewhat simple,
but is practically convenient. Especially, it is convenient to calculate the value of
EF(e) given a matter density inside a NS.

5. Numerically Simulating EF(e) and Y e in A NS (II)

As mentioned in Sec.4, numerically ﬁtting EF(e) and Ye in the core of a NS are
subject to many uncertainties, including the possibility of neutron and proton super-
ﬂuid, of pion condensation, of phase transitions to quark matter2,3, and the conse-
quences of the ∆ resonances32,33. To date, many of relativistic models34,35,36,37,38
have drawn attentions in investigating EoSs because they are particularly suited for
describing NSs according to the special relativity. The most common among them
is the relativistic-mean- ﬁeld (RMF) theory, which has become a standard method
to study nuclear matter and ﬁnite-nuclei properties.

As an up-to-date representative theoretical work in RMF theory is Dutra et al.
(2014)15, in which 263 RMF models are examined three diﬀerent sets of constraints
related to pure neutron matter, symmetric nuclear matter, symmetry energy, and
its derivatives are used. The authors gave a detailed discussion of these models
when investigating properties like realistic values of the asymmetry energy and
its slope, compressibility and the question that whether the EoS can actually re-
produce 2-solar mass stars, as have been observed in PSR J1615-223039, within
the whole NS interior, and added extensive supernova EOS online tables (like on
http://compose.obspm.fr).

According to RMF theory, baryonic interactions include three cases: (1) ex-
changing three mesons of σ, ω and ρ; (2) exchanging four mesons of σ, ω, ρ and σ;
(3) exchanging ﬁve mesons of σ, ω, ρ, σ∗, φ. In order to provide a new insight into
application of RMF models to the nuclear matter properties, Dutra et al. (2014)
considered the four-meson-exchange baryonic interactions, and divided the RMF
models into seven types regarding their lagrangian density structures: Typ1-1: lin-
ear ﬁnite range models in which A = B = C = α1 = α2 = α
3 = gσ = 0;

In this paper, for the purpose of comparing with the classical models applied
in Sec.4, we will choose Type-2 in Dutra et al. (2014) as a representative RMF
theoretical work. The main merit of Type-2 in Dutra et al (2014) lies in that it
describes well the properties of EoS of a NS in the vicinity of the saturated nuclear
density ρ0.

From Eq.(1) of Dutra et al. (2014), we get the eﬀective lagrangian of Type-2 in

In the work of Dutra et al. (2014), the authors listed more than 130 RMF
models for Type-2. These models have been widely used because of several impor-
tant aspects not always present in non-relativistic models (e.g., intrinsic Lorentz
covariance, appropriate saturation mechanism for nuclear matter and etc). Unfor-
tunately, the authors didn’t present any information on the electron Fermi energy
and electron fraction within these models, due to the restriction of space.

In order to obtain better agreement for the behavior of EOS at high matter
densities with that predicted by the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory,
the parameter set TMA was developed, based on two other widely used parameter
sets, TM1 and TM240. The parameter set TMA has been one of the most successful
modern parameter sets. In this work, we select the parameter set TMA 41,42 for
the mean-ﬁeld Lagrangian density, and list the parameter values in Table 4.

In addition, the properties of ground-state nuclear matter include: the saturation
density ρ0=0.147 (fm)−3, bulk binding energy/nucleon (E/A)∞ = −16.0 MeV, in-
compressibility K = 318.0 MeV, bulk symmetry energy/nucleon asym = 30.68 MeV,
and the eﬀective mass ratio m∗/m = 0.63541,42.

Inserting the above parameters into Eq.(34) and Eq.(35), we get the relation
of ε and P in Dutra et al.(2014) (Type-2), shown as in Fig.8. Here the relation of
c=1 MeV×5.43 × 10−3 fm−1 is used. From Fig. 8, it’s obvious that P increases
with ε in the whole interior of a NS. Inserting EoSs (Eq.(34) and Eq.(35)) into TOV

mass limit of ∼ 1.97MSun for PSR J1615-223039, which indicates our parameter-set
choice (TMA) is rather reliable and successful.

We also calculate the values of EF(e) and Ye in the whole density range in Dutra
et al. (2014)(Type-2), as listed in Appendix B. Based on Tables 5-8 in Appendix B,
we numerically ﬁt the relations of Ye vs. Log10ρ and EF(e) vs. Log10ρ in Dutra et
al. (2014) (Type-2), as shown in Fig.10, and obtain a set of analytical expressions
of

Ye = −0.000012 + 1.213 × 10−9eLog10ρ − 2.51 × 10−15e2Log10ρ + 8.19 × 10−21e3Log10ρ,
Ye = 0.0644 − 1.506 × 10−7eLog10ρ + 1.11 × 10−13e2Log10ρ + 1.84 × 10−20e3Log10ρ,
Ye = −0.188 + 1.85 × 10−7eLog10ρ − 3.59 × 10−14e2Log10ρ + 2.54 × 10−21e3Log10ρ, (37)

for ρ ∼ 6.92 × 1011 − 6.07 × 1013, 6.07 × 1013 − 6.9 × 1014, and 6.9 × 1014 − 2.56 ×
1015 g cm−3, respectively.

Combining Eq.(37) with the special solution of Eq.(14), we plot the diagram
of EF(e) vs. Log10ρ (see the solid-line of Fig.10(b)), and compare our results with
those in Dutra et al.(2014)(Type-2)(see the dotted-line of Fig.10(b)). As shown in
Fig.10(b), the ﬁtted values of electron Fermi energies are well in agreement with
their calculated values, which indicates that the pairs of EF(e) and Ye in Tables 5-8
in Appendix B are suited for the special solution of Eq.(14). In other words, the
special solution of Eq.(14) is equally applicable to RMF models.

We have found that both Ye and EF(e) increase with matter density in Dutra et
al. (2014)(Type-2). Here, the maximum of central density is arbitrarily selected to
be ρ =1.4 fm−3, corresponding to Ye = 0.15570 and EF(e) = 367.40 MeV. Like in
classical models, the increase in EF(e) in RMF theory is also caused by an increase
in electron number density in the core of a NS.

6. Comparisons and Discussions

6.1. Relations of Ye and ρ in diﬀerent models.

The numerical simulations above indicate that the relation of Ye and ρ is model
dependent. In order to see the diﬀerences between relations of Ye and ρ in several
simple classical models (in this work) with those in RMF theory, we produce the
diagrams of Ye vs. Log10ρ in the interior of a NS, as shown in Fig.11. In Fig.11 the
black solid-line is obtained by ﬁtting in Sec.4, and the red solid-line is ﬁtted from
data of Tables 5-8 in Appendix B in this work. for Dutra et al. (2014)(Type-2). By
comparing, some classical models (e.g., BPS and BBP models) may be superior to
RMF theory model in the low-density crustal region. For example, Ye in Dutra et al.
(2014)(Type-2) begins to appear at ρ = 6.92 × 1011 g cm−3, and always increases
with ρ in the high-density range. However, employing the TMA parameter set,
Dutra et al. (2014)(Type-2) will be more excellent than the simple ideal nepµ and
nepµ models when describing the relation of Ye and ρ from EoSs, because nucleon-
nucleon interaction potentials are replaced by meson ﬁelds in RMF theory, rather
than be ignored. It is interesting that Ye in Dutra et al. (2014)(Type-2) grows with
ρ more quickly than in ideal npe and npeµ systems.

In order to make a further comparison, in Fig. 11 we add one blue dot-line ﬁtted
from Shen 200236. In Shen (2002), the author constructed the EoS in a wide NS
density range using RMF theory. At low densities, the Thomas-Fermi approximation
was used to describe the nonuniform matter composed of a lattice of heavy nuclei;
while at high densities, the T M 1 parameter set was adopted. Thus, Ye in Shen
(2002) ﬁrstly increases with ρ, then decreases with ρ. However, since the inclusion
of hyperons softens the EoS considerably at high densities, the maximum of the
stellar mass in Shen (2002) is about 1.6 MSun,(due to the depression of hyperons
on Fermions), which deviates from the observational NS mass limit of ∼ 1.97 MSun
for PSR J1615-223039.

From the comparisons above, the diﬀerences of relations of Ye and ρ between
diﬀerent models are obvious. Despite these diﬀerences, we believe the simulations
and comparisons presented in this work will be useful in studying EF(e) and Ye of
a NS in the future.

6.2. Relation of EF(e) and ne

Though both EF(e) and Ye are deﬁnite functions of ρ. the value of EF(e) is ulti-
mately determined by only parameter ne,

Fig. 12. The relation of EF(e) and ne for relativistic electrons in a common NS.

From Fig. 12, it is easy to see that, the larger the electron number density, the
bigger the electron Fermi energy become. In Fig.12, the dotted line is ﬁtted from
data of Tables 5-7 in Dutra et al. (2014) (Type-2), while the solid line is obtained
from Eq.(38). These two lines are well in agreement with each other which indicates
that our calculations of Dutra et al. (2014)(Type-2) and the model self are surely
correct.

Other Fermi parameters for electrons are also solely determined by ne. For ex-

Fermi momentum, pF(e) = kF = (3π2ne)1/3, and the Fermi kinetic energy of rel-
ativistic electrons, EF
K(e) ≫ mec2), where
kF = (3π2ne)1/3 is the electron Fermi wave-vector. However, the relations of ne and
ρ in diﬀerent density regions of a NS are usually unknown, and the known relations
of ne and ρ depend on EoS in some speciﬁc matter models. Our study on EF(e)
may provide some conveniences in investigating EoS of a NS.

K (e) ≈ cpF(e) = c(3π2ne)1/3, due to EF

6.3. Relations of EF(e), Ye and B

In our previous studies, by introducing the Dirac δ-function in superhigh magnetic
ﬁelds (B ∗ = B/Bcr ≫ 1, Bcr = 4.414×1013 G is the electron critical ﬁeld), we inves-
tigated the eﬀects of strong magnetic ﬁelds on EoS and braking of magnetars44,45.
Since superhigh magnetic ﬁelds can cause an increase in Ye by modifying the
electron phase space, the electron number density will increase with magnetic ﬁeld
strength B. From Table 1 of Gao et al.(2013)13, we obtain the diagrams of Ye vs.
ρ in BPS model in diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds, shown as in Fig. 13. Then, the Fermi

cally ﬁtting the relations between EF(e), Ye and ρ in superhigh magnetic ﬁelds will
be considered in our future work.

7. Conclusions

In this paper we deduced a special solution to Fermi energy of relativistic elec-
trons in a common NS. By numerically simulating, we obtained several analytical
formulae for Ye vs. ρ within classical matter models and Dutra et al.(2014)(Type-2).
As a representative model, BBP model is selected to test the validity of the
speciﬁc solution to EF(e). By comparing, our method of calculating EF(e) is more
simple and convenient than that in BBP model, as well as those in other matter
models.

Using the special solution to EF(e), we can quickly and accurately calculate the
value of Fermi energy for relativistic electrons in any given matter density. The
special solution can be universally suitable for relativistic electrons regions in the
circumstances of common NSs.

By numerically simulating, the special solution to EF(e) has been proved to be
not only suitable for simple classical matter models, but also for and RMF theory
models), though Dutra et al.(2014)(Type-2) was only selected as a presented theory
work. Also, the special solution to EF(e), as well as Eq.(38), could be very useful in
indirectly testing whether one EoS of a NS is correct, because Eq.(38) is the source
of the special solution of Eq.(14).

As an important parameter in EoS of a NS, the electron Fermi energy is surely
of very interest. The special solution to EF(e) introduced by this work will be very
useful in the future study on EoS of NSmatter under extreme conditions, though
our methods of treating EoS when numerically ﬁtting are indeed simple.

Appendix A. Other classical matter models for the crust of a NS

Since BPS model was developed on the basis of the semi-empirical mass formula, it’s
necessary to introduce the work of Bethe, Borner & Sato (1970)47(hereinafterBBS
model) that is a typical semi-empirical-mass-formular model. In BBS model, the

(A.1)

where N is the neutron number, Z is the proton number, and A = N + Z is the nu-
cleon number. The ﬁrst term, the second term, the third term and the fourth term
on the right-hand side of Eq.(A1) denote the volume energy, Coulomb energy, sym-
metry energy and surface energy, respectively; the energy constants c1=16 MeV,
c2=0.72 MeV, c3=24 MeV, and c4=18 MeV. The above equation ﬁts the exper-
imental data very well for A ∼ 4 to 260 after correcting for shell eﬀects and for
Wigner term47. After ignoring the small neutron-proton mass diﬀerence, the elec-
tron chemical potential µe (i.e., the electron Fermi energy) becomes

µe = µn − µp =

From Eq.(15) in BBS model47, we get the relation of A and x,

A =

x−2 = 12.5x−2 .

where x = Z/A. Thus, Ye is simply expressed as a function of A

Ye ≈ Z/A = (

Based on Eq.(A4) and Table 2 in Section 4.1, we plot a schematic diagram of Ye
vs. A for relativistic electrons in BBS model and BPS model, as shown in Fig.9(a).
Combining Eq.(A4) with Table 1 in BBS model47, we plot a schematic diagram of
EF(e) and ρ in BBS model, as shown in Fig.9(b). In this ﬁgure we add the ﬁtting
curve of EF(e) vs. Log10(ρ) from BPS model20.

Fig. 14. Comparisons of BBS model and BPS model in weak ﬁeld limit. Left, the relations of Ye
and A in BBS and BPS models. Right, the relations of EF(e) and ρ in BBS and BPS models.

From Fig. 9, in BBS model the electron fraction Ye is solely determined by
nucleon number A, i.e., Ye monotonously decreases with A; whereas in BPS model

March 2, 2016 1:35 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

Ye is determined by equilibrium nuclei and composition from EoS. The diﬀerence
of EF(e) between these two models increases with matter density. Since the semi-
empirical mass formula will not ﬁt the experimental data when ρ > ρd, we stop
comparing these two models at the higher densities above 4.3 × 1013 g cm−3. In
addition, in BBS model the neutron drip density ρd = 2.8 × 1011 g cm−3, and the
nuclei will disappear suddenly when ρ = 4.34×1013 g cm−3. Due to the introduction
of lattice energy, BPS model is superior to all the semi-empirical mass-formula
models including BBS model.

Considering the limit of the semi-empirical mass formula, Buchler & Barkat
(1971)48 (hereinafter BB model) and Barkat, Buchler & Wheeler (1972)49 (here-
inafter BBW model) calculated the nuclear composition and EOS, and gave the
relation of Z and A and the expression of the surface energy by using Thomas-
Fermi method. However, both of these models cannot give deﬁnite values of A and
A for stable nuclei, and the diﬀerences of surface-energy form between BB, BBW
and BBP models are very large. Employing Hartree-Fock and Thomas-Fermi meth-
ods, Revenhall, Bennett & Pethick (1972)50(hereinafter RBP model) modiﬁed the
surface energy, calculated EoS, and gave the relation of Z and ρ. However, the ex-
pression of Z and ρ in RBW model is similar to that of BB model, but is diﬀerent
from that of BBP model.
