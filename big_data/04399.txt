1. Introduction

J. Lepowsky and R. L. Wilson [LW] initiated the approach to combinatorial
Rogers-Ramanujan type identities via vertex operator constructions of representa-
tions of aﬃne Kac-Moody Lie algebras. In [MP1] this approach is developed further

for sl(2, C)e by using vertex operator algebras and Verma modules. In this paper we

use the same method to construct combinatorial bases for basic modules of aﬃne
Lie algebra of type C(1)
n .

The starting point in [MP1] is a PBW spanning set of a standard (i.e., integrable
highest weight) module L(Λ) of level k, which is then reduced to a basis by using
the relation

xθ(z)k+1 = 0

on L(Λ).

In [MP1] this relation was interpreted in terms of vertex operator algebras and it
was proved for any level k standard module of any untwisted aﬃne Kac-Moody Lie
algebra.

After a PBW spanning set is reduced to a basis, it remains to prove its linear
independence. The main ingredient of the proof is a combinatorial use of relation

xθ(z) d

dz (xθ(z)k+1) = (k + 1)xθ(z)k+1 d

dz xθ(z)

for the annihilating ﬁeld xθ(z)k+1. This relation was also interpreted in terms of
vertex operator algebras.

By following ideas developed in [MP1] and [MP2], in [P1] and [P2] a general
construction of relations for annihilating ﬁelds is given by using vertex operator
algebras, and by using these relations the problem of constructing combinatorial
bases of standard modules is split into a “combinatorial part of the problem” and
a “representation theory part of the problem ”.

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

In this paper we use these results to construct combinatorial bases of basic mod-
ules for aﬃne Lie algebras of type C(1)
n . A major new insight is a combinatorial
parametrization in [PˇS] of leading terms of deﬁning relations for all standard mod-
ules for aﬃne Lie algebra of type C(1)
n . This is, hopefully, an important step towards
a solution of “combinatorial part of the problem” of constructing combinatorial
bases of standard modules for aﬃne Lie algebras.

In ﬁrst nine sections we give a detailed outline of ideas and results involved in
this approach, we introduce notation and recall necessary general results from [P1]
and [P2]. The results from [P1] on relations among relations are formulated in
“untwisted setting”—this may alleviate using the results which are quite technical
in “twisted setting”. In Section 10 we prove Proposition 10.1 which is the starting
point of our construction of combinatorial basis of the basic module L(Λ0) for
aﬃne Lie algebra of type C(1)
In Section 11 we prove linear independence of
n .
combinatorial bases by using the combinatorial result from [PˇS] for counting the
number of two-embeddings. As a consequence, in Section 12 we obtain a series of
combinatorial Rogers-Ramanujan type identities.

We thank Arne Meurman for many stimulating discussions and help in under-

standing the combinatorics of leading terms.

2. Vertex algebras and generating fields

Two formal Laurent series a(z) = P anz−n−1 and b(z) = P bnz−n−1, with

coeﬃcients in some associative algebra, are said to be mutually local if for some
non-negative integer N

(z1 − z2)N a(z1)b(z2) = (z1 − z2)N b(z2)a(z1).

A vertex algebra V is a vector space equipped with a speciﬁed vector 1 called the
vacuum vector, a linear operator D on V called the derivation and a linear map

V → (End V )[[z−1, z]],

v 7→ Y (v, z) =Xn∈Z

vnz−n−1

satisfying the following conditions for u, v ∈ V :

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

unv = 0

for n suﬃciently large,

[D, Y (u, z)] = Y (Du, z) =

d
dz

Y (u, z),

Y (1, z) = idV
Y (u, z)1 ∈ (End V )[[z]] and

(the identity operator on V ),

lim
z→0

Y (u, z)1 = u,

Y (u, z) and Y (v, z) are mutually local.

Haisheng Li showed [L] that this deﬁnition of vertex algebra is equivalent to the
original one given by R. E. Borcherds [B]. A formal Laurent series Y (u, z) is called
the vertex operator (ﬁeld) associated with the vector (state) u, and (2.4) gives a
state-ﬁeld correspondence. For coeﬃcients of vertex operators Y (u, z) and Y (v, z)
we have the commutator formula

(2.6)

[um, vn] =Xi≥0

(cid:18)m
i(cid:19)(uiv)m+n−i.

Let M be a vector space and a(z) and b(z) two formal Laurent series with

coeﬃcients in End M such that for each w ∈ M

(2.7)

amw = 0 and bmw = 0

for m suﬃciently large.

Then for each integer n we have a well deﬁned product

(2.8)

a(z)nb(z) = Resz1 ((z1 − z)na(z1)b(z) − (−z + z1)nb(z)a(z1)) ,

with the convention that (z1 − z)n = zn
1 (1 − z/z1)n denotes a series obtained by the
binomial formula for (1 − ζ)n. If we think of vertex algebra as a vector space given
1, D and multiplications unv, satisfying (2.1)–(2.5), then we can state the theorem
on generating ﬁelds due to Haisheng Li [L]:

Theorem 2.1. A family of mutually local formal Laurent series with coeﬃcients
in End M , satisfying (2.7), generates a vertex algebra with the vacuum 1 = idM ,
the derivation D = d

dz and the multiplications a(z)nb(z).

Vertex operator algebra (see [FLM]) is a vertex algebra V with a conformal

vector ω such that Y (ω, z) =P Lnz−n−2 gives the Virasoro algebra operators Ln ,
with L−1 = D. It is also required that L0 deﬁnes a Z-grading V =` Vn truncated

from below with ﬁnite-dimensional eigenspaces Vn.

For u ∈ Vn we write wt u = n. We shall sometimes use another convention for

writing coeﬃcients of vertex operators,

Y (u, z) =Xn∈Z

u(n)z−n−wt u,

so that u(n) is a homogeneous operator on the graded space V of degree n.

For a vertex operator algebra V we have a vertex operator algebra structure
on V ⊗ V with ﬁelds Y (u ⊗ v, z) = Y (u, z) ⊗ Y (v, z) and the conformal vector
ω ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ω (see [FHL]).

3. Vertex algebras for affine Lie algebras

Let g be a simple complex Lie algebra, h a Cartan subalgebra of g and h , i a
symmetric invariant bilinear form on g. Via this form we identify h and h∗ and we
assume that hθ, θi = 2 for the maximal root θ (with respect to some ﬁxed basis of
the root system). Set

ˆg = aj∈Z

g ⊗ tj + Cc,

˜g = ˆg + Cd.

Then ˜g is the associated untwisted aﬃne Kac-Moody Lie algebra (cf. [K]) with the
commutator

[x(i), y(j)] = [x, y](i + j) + iδi+j,0hx, yic.

Here, as usual, x(i) = x ⊗ ti for x ∈ g and i ∈ Z, c is the canonical central element,
and [d, x(i)] = ix(i). Sometimes we shall denote g ⊗ tj by g(j). We identify g and
g(0). Set

˜g<0 = aj<0

g ⊗ tj,

˜g≤0 = aj≤0

g ⊗ tj + Cd,

˜g≥0 = aj≥0

g ⊗ tj + Cd.

4

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

For k ∈ C denote by Cvk the one-dimensional (˜g≥0 + Cc)-module on which ˜g≥0
acts trivially and c as the multiplication by k. The aﬃne Lie algebra ˜g gives rise to
the vertex operator algebra (see [FZ] and [L], here we use the notation from [MP1])

N (kΛ0) = U (˜g) ⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc) Cvk

for level k 6= −g∨, where g∨ is the dual Coxeter number of g; it is generated by the
ﬁelds

(3.1)

x(z) =Xn∈Z

xnz−n−1,

x ∈ g,

where we set xn = x(n) for x ∈ g. By the state-ﬁeld correspondence we have

x(z) = Y (x(−1)1, z)

for x ∈ g.

The Z-grading is given by L0 = −d.

From now on we shall ﬁx the level k ∈ Z>0, and we shall often denote by V the

vertex operator algebra structure on the generalized Verma ˜g-module N (kΛ0).

4. A completion of the enveloping algebra

Let U = U (ˆg)/(c − k), where U (ˆg) is the universal enveloping algebra of ˆg and
(c − k) is the ideal generated by the element c − k. Note that ˜g-modules of level k
are U-modules. Note that U (ˆg) is graded by the derivation d, and so is the quotient
U. Let us denote the homogeneous components of the graded algebra U by U(n),
n ∈ Z. We take

(4.1)

U(n − i)U(i),

p ∈ Z>0 ,

Wp(n) =Xi≥p

to be a fundamental system of neighborhoods of 0 ∈ U(n). It is easy to see that
we have a Hausdorﬀ topological group (U(n), +), and we denote by U(n) the cor-
responding completion, introduced in [FZ] (cf. also [H], [FF], and [KL]). Then

U = an∈Z

U(n)

is a topological ring.

The deﬁnition (4.1) of a fundamental system of neighborhoods is so designed
that the product a(z)nb(z) of two formal Laurent series with coeﬃcients in U is well
deﬁned by the formula (2.8). Haisheng Li’s arguments in the proof of Theorem 2.1
apply literally and we have:

Proposition 4.1. A family of mutually local formal Laurent series (3.1) with co-
eﬃcients in U generates a vertex algebra V ′ with the vacuum 1 ∈ U, the derivation
D = d

dz and the multiplications a(z)nb(z). Moreover, the linear map

extends uniquely to an isomorphism Y : V → V ′ of vertex operator algebras.

Y : x(−1)1 7→ x(z)

for x ∈ g

The map

Y : V → U [[z, z−1]],

v 7→ Y (v, z) =Xn∈Z

vnz−n−1,

was ﬁrst constructed by I. B. Frenkel and Y. Zhu in [FZ, Deﬁnition 2.2.2] by using
another method. From now on we shall consider the coeﬃcients vn of Y (v, z) for

COMBINATORIAL BASES OF BASIC MODULES FOR C (1)

n

v ∈ V as elements in the completion U. Then for any highest weight ˜g-module M
of level k the elements vn ∈ U act on M , deﬁning a representation of the vertex
operator algebra V on M .

By following the notation in [FF] we set

Uloc = C-span{vn | v ∈ V, n ∈ Z} ⊂ U,

From the commutator formula (2.6) we see that Uloc is a Lie algebra. Let us denote
by U the associative subalgebra of U generated by Uloc. By construction we have
U ⊂ U . Clearly

U = an∈Z

U (n),

where U (n) ⊂ U is the homogeneous subspace of degree n.

5. Annihilating fields of standard modules

For the ﬁxed positive integer level k the generalized Verma ˜g-module N (kΛ0) is
reducible, and we denote by N 1(kΛ0) its maximal ˜g-submodule. By [K, Corollary
10.4] the submodule N 1(kΛ0) is generated by the singular vector xθ(−1)k+11, where
xθ is a root vector in g. Set

R = U (g)xθ(−1)k+11,

¯R = C-span{rn | r ∈ R, n ∈ Z}.

Then R ⊂ N 1(kΛ0) is an irreducible g-module, and ¯R ⊂ U is the corresponding
loop ˜g-module for the adjoint action given by the commutator formula (2.6).

We have the following theorem (see [DL], [FZ], [L], [MP1]):

Theorem 5.1. Let M be a highest weight ˜g-module of level k. The following are
equivalent:

(1) M is a standard module,
(2) ¯R annihilates M .

This theorem implies that for a dominant integral weight Λ of level Λ(c) = k we

have

¯RM (Λ) = M 1(Λ),

where M 1(Λ) denotes the maximal submodule of the Verma ˜g-module M (Λ). Fur-
thermore, since R generates the vertex algebra ideal N 1(kΛ0) ⊂ V , vertex operators
Y (v, z), v ∈ N 1(kΛ0), annihilate all standard ˜g-modules L(Λ) = M (Λ)/M 1(Λ) of
level k.

We shall call the elements rn ∈ ¯R relations (for standard modules), and Y (v, z),

v ∈ N 1(kΛ0), annihilating ﬁelds (of standard modules). It is clear that the ﬁeld

generates all annihilating ﬁelds.

Y (xθ(−1)k+11, z) = xθ(z)k+1

6. Tensor products and induced representations

The vertex operator algebra V has a Lie algebra structure with the commutator

(6.1)

[u, v] = u−1v − v−1u = Xn≥0

(−1)nD(n+1)(unv),

and ˜g<01 is a Lie subalgebra. Moreover, the map

˜g<01 → ˜g<0,

u 7→ u−1,

6

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

is a Lie algebra isomorphism and we have the “adjoint” action

u−1 : v 7→ [u, v]

of the Lie algebra ˜g<0 on V . Since L−1, L0 and y0, y ∈ g, are derivations of the
product u−1v, they are also derivations of the bracket [u, v], and we can extend
the “adjoint” action of the Lie algebra ˜g<0 on V to the “adjoint” action of the Lie
algebra

CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0 ∼=(cid:0)CL−1 + CL0 + g(0)(cid:1) ⋉ ˜g<01.

The subspace

¯R 1 =

nai=0

DiR ⊂ V

is a ˜g≥0-submodule invariant for the action of D = L−1. Then the right hand side
of (6.1) implies that ¯R 1 is invariant for the “adjoint” action of CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0, we
shall denote it by ( ¯R 1)ad.

Hence we have the induced ˜g-module U (˜g)⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc)

( ¯R 1)ad ⊗ V of (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-modules, and we have two maps

¯R 1 and the tensor product

Ψ : U (˜g) ⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc)

¯R 1 → N (kΛ0),

u ⊗ w 7→ uw,

Φ : ( ¯R 1)ad ⊗ V → V,

u ⊗ w 7→ u−1w.

Note that the map Ψ is a homomorphism of ˜g-modules, and that Ψ intertwines the
actions of L−1 and L0. Hence, by restriction, Ψ is a (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-module map.
The following theorem relates ker Φ with induced representations of ˜g:

Theorem 6.1. (i) There is a unique isomorphism of (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-modules

Ξ : ( ¯R 1)ad ⊗ V → U (˜g) ⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc)

¯R 1

such that Ξ(w ⊗ 1) = 1 ⊗ w for all w ∈ ¯R 1.

(ii) The map Φ is is a homomorphism of (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-modules and Φ = Ψ ◦ Ξ.

In particular, ker Φ is a (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-module and

Ξ(ker Φ) = ker Ψ.

We call elements in ker Φ relations for annihilating ﬁelds (cf. [P1], [P2]) since

X : Y (a, z)Y (b, z) : = 0

for X a ⊗ b ∈ ker Φ.

By Theorem 6.1 we may identify the relations for annihilating ﬁelds with elements
of ker Ψ, which is easier to study by using the representation theory of aﬃne Lie
algebras.

7. Generators of relations for annihilating fields

Let {xi}i∈I and {yi}i∈I be dual bases in g. For r ∈ R we deﬁne Sugawara’s

relation

(7.1)

qr =

1

k + g∨ Xi∈I

xi(−1) ⊗ yi(0)r − 1 ⊗ Dr

as an element of U (˜g)⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc)
relation qr does not depend on a choice of dual bases {xi}i∈I and {yi}i∈I .

¯R 1. As in the case of Casimir operator, Sugawara’s

COMBINATORIAL BASES OF BASIC MODULES FOR C (1)

Proposition 7.1. (i) qr is an element of ker Ψ.

(ii) r 7→ qr is a g-module homomorphism from R into ker Ψ.
(iii) x(i)qr = 0 for all x ∈ g and i > 0.

Let us denote the set of all Sugawara’s relations (7.1) by

and let us deﬁne the ˜g-module homomorphism

QSugawara = {qr | r ∈ R} ⊂ ker Ψ,

Ψ0 : U (˜g) ⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc) R → N (kΛ0),

u ⊗ w 7→ uw.

Then we have:

Proposition 7.2. As a (CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-module ker Ψ is generated by

ker Ψ0 + QSugawara .

Let us denote by α∗ all simple roots of ˜g connected with α0 in a Dynkin diagram:

α∗ 6= α0 ,

hα0, α∨

∗ i 6= 0.

For A(1)

n , n ≥ 2, there are exactly two such simple roots, for all the other untwisted

aﬃne Lie algebras ˜g there is exactly one such simple root. In the case ˜g 6∼= sl(2, C)e

we have a root vector xθ−α∗ = [x−α∗ , xθ] in the corresponding ﬁnite-dimensional g.
Since R generates the maximal ˜g-submodule N 1(kΛ0) of N (kΛ0), we have the

exact sequence of ˜g-modules

U (˜g) ⊗U(˜g≥0+Cc) R

Ψ0−−→ N (kΛ0) → L(kΛ0) → 0.

Generators of ker Ψ0 can be determined by using Garland-Lepowsky’s resolution

· · · → E2 → E1 → E0 → L(kΛ0) → 0

of a standard module in terms of generalized Verma modules [GL], or by using
the BGG type resolution of a standard module in terms of Verma modules, due to
A. Rocha-Caridi and N. R. Wallach [RW]:

Proposition 7.3. Let ˜g 6∼= sl(2, C)e be an untwisted aﬃne Lie algebra. Then ker Ψ0

is generated by the singular vector(s)

xθ−α∗ (−1) ⊗ xθ(−1)k+11−xθ(−1) ⊗ xθ−α∗ (−1)xθ(−1)k1,

hα0, α∨

∗ i 6= 0.

By combining Theorem 6.1 and Propositions 7.2 and 7.3 we have a description

of generators of relations for annihilating ﬁelds:

Theorem 7.4. Let ˜g 6∼= sl(2, C)e be an untwisted aﬃne Lie algebra. Then the

(CL−1 ⋉ ˜g≤0)-module ker Φ is generated by vectors

xθ(−1)k+11 ⊗ xθ−α∗(−1)1 − xθ−α∗ (−1)xθ(−1)k1 ⊗ xθ(−1)1,

hα0, α∨

∗ i 6= 0,

1

k+g∨ Xi∈I

yi(0)xθ(−1)k+11 ⊗ xi(−1)1 + L−1(cid:0) 1

k+g∨ Ω − 1(cid:1)xθ(−1)k+11 ⊗ 1.

This description of generators of relations for annihilating ﬁelds has some disad-
vantages when it comes to combinatorial applications. Namely, the obvious relation

xθ(z)k+1 d

dz xθ(z) − 1

k+1

d

dz (xθ(z)k+1)xθ(z) = 0

for the annihilating ﬁeld xθ(z)k+1 comes from the element

(7.2)

q(k+2)θ = xθ(−2) ⊗ xθ(−1)k+11−xθ(−1) ⊗ xθ(−2)xθ(−1)k1

8

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

in ker Ψ. This element q(k+2)θ has length k + 2 in the natural ﬁltration, but when
written in terms of generators described in Theorem 7.4, it is expressed in terms of
elements of length > k + 2. On the other hand, we can obtain from (7.2) both the
singular vector(s)

q(k+2)θ−α∗ = xθ−α∗(−1) ⊗ xθ(−1)k+11−xθ(−1) ⊗ xθ−α∗ (−1)xθ(−1)k1

in ker Ψ0 and the Sugawara singular vector

q(k+1)θ = 1

xi(−1) ⊗ yi(0)xθ(−1)k+11 − 1 ⊗ Dxθ(−1)k+11

k+g∨ Xi∈I

by using the action of ˜g≥0 on ker Ψ:
Lemma 7.5. Let Ω be the Casimir operator for g 6∼= sl(2, C) and λ = (k + 2)θ − α∗.
Then

q(k+2)θ−α∗ = x−α∗ (1)q(k+2)θ,
q(k+1)θ =

k+1

2(k+2)(k+g∨ )(cid:0)Ω − (λ + 2ρ, λ)(cid:1)x−θ(1)q(k+2)θ.

For any untwisted aﬃne Lie algebra ˜g, including sl(2, C)e, the (CL−1 ⋉˜g)-module

ker Ψ is generated by the vector q(k+2)θ. This generator plays an important role in
combinatorial applications.

8. Leading terms

The associative algebra U = U (ˆg)/(c − k) inherits from U (ˆg) the ﬁltration Uℓ,
ℓ ∈ Z≥0; let us denote by S ∼= S(¯g) the corresponding commutative graded algebra.

Let B be a basis of g. We ﬁx the basis ˜B of ˜g,

˜B = ¯B ∪ {c, d},

B ⊗ tj,

¯B = [j∈Z

so that ¯B may also be viewed as a basis of ¯g = ˆg/Cc. Let (cid:22) be a linear order on ¯B
such that

i < j

implies x(i) ≺ y(j).

The symmetric algebra S has a basis P consisting of monomials in basis elements

¯B. Elements π ∈ P are ﬁnite products of the form

π =

bi(ji),

bi(ji) ∈ ¯B,

ℓYi=1

and we shall say that π is a colored partition of degree |π| =Pℓ

i=1 ji ∈ Z and length
ℓ(π) = ℓ, with parts bi(ji) of degree ji and color bi. We shall usually assume that
parts of π are indexed so that

We associate with a colored partition π its shape sh π, the “plain” partition

b1(j1) (cid:22) b2(j2) (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) bℓ(jℓ).

j1 ≤ j2 ≤ · · · ≤ jℓ.

The basis element 1 ∈ P we call the colored partition of degree 0 and length 0, we
may also denote it by ∅, suggesting it has no parts. The set of all colored partitions
of degree n and length ℓ is denoted as P ℓ(n). The set of all colored partitions with
parts bi(ji) of degree ji < 0 (respectively ji ≤ 0) is denoted as P<0 (respectively
P≤0).

COMBINATORIAL BASES OF BASIC MODULES FOR C (1)

Note that P ⊂ S is a monoid with the unit element 1, the product of monomials
κ and ρ is denoted by κρ. For colored partitions κ, ρ and π = κρ we shall write
κ = π/ρ and ρ ⊂ π. We shall say that ρ ⊂ π is an embedding (of ρ in π), notation
suggesting that π “contains” all the parts of ρ.

We shall ﬁx a monomial basis

u(π) = b1(j1)b2(j2) . . . bn(jℓ),

π ∈ P,

of the enveloping algebra U.

Clearly ¯B ⊂ P, viewed as colored partitions of length 1. We assume that on P
we have a linear order (cid:22) which extends the order (cid:22) on ¯B. Moreover, we assume
that order (cid:22) on P has the following properties:

• ℓ(π) > ℓ(κ) implies π ≺ κ.
• ℓ(π) = ℓ(κ), |π| < |κ| implies π ≺ κ.
• Let ℓ(π) = ℓ(κ), |π| = |κ|. Let π be a partition b1(j1) (cid:22) b2(j2) (cid:22) · · · (cid:22)
bℓ(jℓ) and κ a partition a1(i1) (cid:22) a2(i2) (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) aℓ(iℓ). Then π (cid:22) κ implies
jℓ ≤ iℓ.

• Let ℓ ≥ 0, n ∈ Z and let S ⊂ P be a nonempty subset such that all π in S

have length ℓ(π) ≤ ℓ and degree |π| = n. Then S has a minimal element.

• µ (cid:22) ν implies πµ (cid:22) πν.
• The relation π ≺ κ is a well order on P≤0.

Remark 8.1. An order with these properties is used in [MP1]; colored partitions
are compared ﬁrst by length and degree, and then by comparing degrees of parts
and colors of parts in the reverse lexicographical order.

For π ∈ P, |π| = n, set

U P

[π] = C-span{u(π′) | |π′| = |π|, π′ (cid:23) π} ,

U P

(π) = C-span{u(π′) | |π′| = |π|, π′ ≻ π} ,

the closure taken in U(n). Set

U P (n) = [π∈P, |π|=n

U P

[π],

U P = an∈Z

U P (n) ⊂ U .

The construction of U P depends on a choice of (P, (cid:22)). Since by assumption µ (cid:22) ν
implies πµ (cid:22) πν, we have that U P is a subalgebra of U. Moreover, we have a
sequence of subalgebras:

Proposition 8.2.

U ⊂ U ⊂ U P ⊂ U .

As in [MP1], we have:

Lemma 8.3. For π ∈ P we have U P

[π] = Cu(π) + U P

(π). Moreover,

dim U P

[π]/U P

(π) = 1.

For u ∈ U P

By Proposition 8.4 every nonzero homogeneous u has the unique leading term.
For a nonzero element u ∈ U P we deﬁne the leading term ℓt (u) as the leading
term of the nonzero homogeneous component of u of smallest degree. For a subset
S ⊂ U P set

ℓt (S) = {ℓt (u) | u ∈ S, u 6= 0}.

We are interested mainly in leading terms of elements in U ⊂ U P , which have the
following properties:

Proposition 8.5. For all u, v ∈ U P\{0} we have ℓt (uv) = ℓt (u)ℓt (v).

Proposition 8.6. Let W ⊂ U P be a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and let
ℓt (W ) → W be a map such that

Then {w(ρ) | ρ ∈ ℓt (W )} is a basis of W .

ρ 7→ w(ρ),

ℓt(cid:0)w(ρ)(cid:1) = ρ.

Since R is ﬁnite-dimensional, the space ¯R ⊂ U is a direct sum of ﬁnite-dimension-
al homogeneous subspaces. Hence Proposition 8.6 implies that we can parametrize
a basis of ¯R by the set of leading terms ℓt ( ¯R): we ﬁx a map

ℓt ( ¯R) → ¯R,

ρ 7→ r(ρ)

such that

r(ρ) ∈ U (|ρ|), ℓt (r(ρ)) = ρ,

then {r(ρ) | ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R)} is a basis of ¯R. We will assume that this map is such that the
coeﬃcient C of “the leading term” u(ρ) in “the expansion” of r(ρ) = Cu(ρ) + . . . is
chosen to be C = 1. Note that our assumption R ⊂ N 1(kΛ0) implies that 1 6∈ ℓt ( ¯R)
and that ℓt ( ¯R) · P is a proper ideal in the monoid P.

For an embedding ρ ⊂ π, where ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R), we deﬁne the element u(ρ ⊂ π) in U

by

u(ρ ⊂ π) = u(π/ρ)r(ρ).

9. A rank theorem

Let a ∈ V be a homogeneous element. Then we have

Y (a, z) =Xn∈Z

a(n)z−n−wt a ,

a(n) ∈ U (n).

If M is a level k highest weight ˜g-module, then the action of coeﬃcients a(n) on
M makes M a V -module with vertex operators

YM (a, z) =Xn∈Z

a(n)z−n−wt a ,

a(n) ∈ End M.

Then M ⊗ M is a V ⊗ V -module. For a homogeneous element q = a ⊗ b the vertex
operator is deﬁned by

YM⊗M (q, z) = YM (a, z) ⊗ YM (b, z) =Xn∈Z(cid:16) Xi+j=n

a(i) ⊗ b(j)(cid:17)z−n−wt a−wt a .

Since the condition (2.7) is satisﬁed, the coeﬃcient

q(n) = Xi+j=n

a(i) ⊗ b(j)

COMBINATORIAL BASES OF BASIC MODULES FOR C (1)

n

11

is a well deﬁned operator on M ⊗ M . On the other hand, we want to make sense
of this formula for a(i), b(j) ∈ U , where the condition (2.7) is replaced by the
convergence in the completion U. For this reason set

(cid:0)U ¯⊗U(cid:1)(n) = Yi+j=n(cid:0)U (i) ⊗ U (j)(cid:1),

U ¯⊗U = an∈Z(cid:0)U ¯⊗U(cid:1)(n).
denote them as Pi+j=n a(i) ⊗ b(j). For a ﬁxed n ∈ Z we have a linear map

The elements of U ¯⊗U are ﬁnite sums of homogeneous sequences in U ⊗ U , we shall

deﬁned for homogeneous elements a and b by

χ(n) : V ⊗ V →(cid:0)U ¯⊗U(cid:1)(n)
χ(n) : a ⊗ b 7→ Xp+r=n

a(p) ⊗ b(r).

We think of χ(n)(q) as “the coeﬃcient q(n) of the vertex operator Y (q, z)”. We
shall write q(n) = χ(n)(q) for an element q ∈ V ⊗ V and Q(n) = χ(n)(Q) for a
subspace Q ⊂ V ⊗ V .

Since we have the adjoint action of ˆg on U , we deﬁne “the adjoint action” of ˆg

on U ¯⊗U by

[x(m), Xp+r=n

a(p) ⊗ b(r)] = Xp+r=n

[x(m), a(p)] ⊗ b(r) + Xp+r=n

a(p) ⊗ [x(m), b(r)].

Note that we have the action of ˆg on V ⊗ V given by

xi(a ⊗ b) = (xia) ⊗ b + a ⊗ (xib) ,

x ∈ g, i ∈ Z.

As expected, we have the following commutator formula for q(n) = χ(n)(q):

Proposition 9.1. For x(m) ∈ ˆg and homogeneous q ∈ V ⊗ V we have

[x(m), q(n)] =Xi≥0

(cid:18)m
i(cid:19)(xiq)(m + n),

(Dq)(n) = −(n + wt q)q(n).

So if a subspace Q ⊂ V ⊗ V is invariant for ˜g≥0, then

an∈Z

Q(n)

is a loop ˆg-module, in general reducible.

for a ∈ ¯R1 the coeﬃcient a(i) of the corresponding ﬁeld Y (a, z) can be written as
a ﬁnite linear combination of basis elements r(ρ), ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R). Hence each element

Now assume that q =P a ⊗ b is a homogeneous element in ¯R1 ⊗ V . Note that
of the sequence q(n) = χ(n)(P a ⊗ b) ∈(cid:0)U ¯⊗U(cid:1)(n), say ci, can be written uniquely

as a ﬁnite sum of the form

ci = Xρ∈ℓt ( ¯R)

r(ρ) ⊗ bρ,

where bρ ∈ U . If bρ 6= 0, then it is clear that |ρ| + |ℓt (bρ)| = n. Let us assume
that q(n) 6= 0, and for nonzero “i-th” component ci let πi be the smallest possible
ρ ℓt (bρ) that appears in the expression for ci. Denote by S the set of all such πi.
Since q is a ﬁnite sum of elements of the form a ⊗ b, it is clear that there is ℓ
such that ℓ(πi) ≤ ℓ. Then, by our assumptions on the order (cid:22), the set S has the

12

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

minimal element, and we call it the leading term ℓt(cid:0)q(n)(cid:1) of q(n). For a subspace

Q ⊂ ¯R1 ⊗ V set

ℓt (Q(n)) = {ℓt (q(n)) | q ∈ Q, q(n) 6= 0}.

For a colored partition π of set

N (π) = max{#E(π)−1, 0},

E(π) = {ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R) | ρ ⊂ π}.

Note that V ⊗ V has a natural ﬁltration (V ⊗ V )ℓ, ℓ ∈ Z≥0, inherited from the

ﬁltration U ℓ, ℓ ∈ Z≥0. Then we have the following “rank theorem”:

Theorem 9.2. Let Q ⊂ ker(cid:0)Φ | ( ¯R1 ⊗ V )ℓ(cid:1) be a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and

n ∈ Z. Assume that ℓ(π) = ℓ for all π ∈ ℓt (Q(n)). If

(9.1)

N (π) = dim Q(n),

Xπ∈P ℓ(n)

then for any two embeddings ρ1 ⊂ π and ρ2 ⊂ π in π ∈ P ℓ(n), where ρ1, ρ2 ∈ ℓt ( ¯R),
we have a relation

(9.2)

u(ρ1 ⊂ π) ∈ u(ρ2 ⊂ π) + C-span{u(ρ ⊂ π′) | ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R), ρ ⊂ π′, π ≺ π′}.

Combinatorial relations (9.2) for the deﬁning relations r(ρ) of standard modules
are needed for construction of combinatorial bases of standard modules. The left
hand side of (9.1) is, for a given degree n, the total number N (n) of relations needed,
and the right hand side of (9.1) is the number of relations that we can construct
by using the representation theory. As expected, N (n) ≥ dim Q(n).

It should be noted that relations of the form (9.2) are easy to obtain when
ρ1ρ2 ⊂ π. The problem is when two embeddings “intersect”. Such relations for
r(ρ) of the combinatorial form (9.2) are obtained as linear combinations of relations
constructed from “coeﬃcients q(n) of vertex operators Y (q, z)”. In another words,
a relation of the form (9.2) is a solution of certain system of linear equations, its
existence is guaranteed by the condition (9.1).

10. The problem of constructing a combinatorial basis of L(kΛ0)

We shall illustrate the (desired) construction of combinatorial bases of standard

modules on the simpler case of L(kΛ0).

We assume we have an ordered basis B and we deﬁne the order (cid:22) on P by

comparing partitions gradually

(1) by length,
(2) by degree,
(3) by shape with reverse lexicographical order,
(4) by colors with reverse lexicographical order.
Set r(k+1)θ = xθ(−1)k+11. Then, as in [MP1], we have

ℓt (cid:0)r(k+1)θ(n)(cid:1) = xθ(−j − 1)axθ(−j)b

with a+b = k +1 and (−j −1)a+(−j)b = n. Since we can obtain all other elements
r(n) for r ∈ R by the adjoint action of g, which does not change the length and
degree, we have that shapes of leading terms of r(n) remain the same:

with a + b = k + 1 and (−j − 1)a + (−j)b = n. Let us introduce the notation

(10.1)

sh ℓt(cid:0)r(n)(cid:1) = (−j − 1)a(−j)b

D = ℓt ( ¯R) ∩ P<0 ,

RR = P<0\(cid:0)D · P<0(cid:1).

COMBINATORIAL BASES OF BASIC MODULES FOR C (1)

n

13

We shall denote by 1 the highest weight vector in the standard module L(kΛ0) =

N (kΛ0)/N 1(kΛ0).

Proposition 10.1. If for each ℓ ∈ {k + 2, . . . , 2k + 1} there exists a ﬁnite-dimen-

sional subspace Qℓ ⊂ ker(cid:0)Φ | ( ¯R1 ⊗ V )ℓ(cid:1) such that ℓ(π) = ℓ for all π ∈ ℓt (Qℓ(n))

and

Xπ∈P ℓ(n)

N (π) = dim Qℓ(n),

for all n ≤ −k − 2, then the set of vectors

(10.2)

u(π)1 ,

π ∈ RR,

is a basis of the standard module L(kΛ0).

Proof. Since elements in R are of degree k + 1, and there is no element in N 1(kΛ0)
of smaller degree, for ρ ∈ ℓt ( ¯R) we have that r(ρ)1 = 0 whenever |ρ| > −k − 1.
Hence (10.1) implies that ρ ∈ D whenever r(ρ)1 6= 0. Since N 1(kΛ0) = ¯RN (kΛ0) =
U (˜g<0) ¯R1, we have a spanning set of N 1(kΛ0)

u(κ)r(ρ)1 = u(ρ ⊂ κρ)1 ,

κ ∈ P<0 , ρ ∈ D.

For each π ∈ D · P<0 choose exactly one ρπ ∈ D such that ρπ ⊂ π. Since by our
assumptions we can apply Theorem 9.2, for each π ∈ D · P<0 such that π = κ1ρ1 =
κ2ρ2 we have a relation (9.2). Hence, by using induction, we se that

π ∈ D · P<0 ,
(10.3)
is a spanning set of N 1(kΛ0). Since by Proposition 8.5

u(ρπ ⊂ π)1 ,

ℓt(cid:0)u(π/ρπ)r(ρπ)(cid:1) =(cid:0)π/ρπ) · ρπ = π ,

we have that

u(ρπ ⊂ π)1 ∈ u(π)1 + U P

(π) 1,

and by induction we see that the set (10.3) is linearly independent. Hence this set
is a basis of N 1(kΛ0).

In the obvious way we can assign to each colored partition π its weight wt π, and

we have characters

ch N (kΛ0) = Xπ∈P<0

ewt π,

ch N 1(kΛ0) = Xπ∈D·P<0

ewt π.

Hence we have

(10.4)

ch L(kΛ0) = Xπ∈RR

ewt π.

To ﬁnd a basis of L(kΛ0) we start with the PBW spanning set

For π ∈ D · P<0 we have

u(π)1 ,

π ∈ P<0 .

u(π) ∈ u(π/ρπ)r(ρπ) + U P

(π).

Since r(ρπ)1 = 0 in L(kΛ0), we have
u(π)1 ∈ U P

(π) 1 for π ∈ D · P<0,

and by using induction we can reduce the PBW spanning set to a spanning set
(10.2). By the character formula (10.4) this set is linearly independent.
(cid:3)

Remarks. (i) At the moment just a few examples are known where the conditions of

Theorem 9.2 are satisﬁed, the simplest is for the basic sl(2, C)e-module (see [MP1]).

With the usual notation x = xθ, h = θ∨ and y = x−θ, the set of leading terms
ℓt ( ¯R) is:

b1(−j)b2(−j) with colors b1b2 :

yy, yh, hh, hx, xx,

b1(−j − 1)b2(−j) with colors b1b2 :

yy, hy, xy, xh, xx.

If one takes

Q3 = U (g)q2θ ⊕ U (g)q3θ,

then, by using Proposition 9.1 and loop modules, dim Q3(n) = 5 + 7 and (9.1) holds
for all n. If one takes (1, 2)-specialization of the Weyl-Kac character formula on
one side, and (10.4) on the other side, one obtains a Capparelli identity [C].

(ii) The results in Section 9 can be extended to twisted aﬃne Lie algebras (see
[P1]). In such formulation of Theorem 9.2 the equality (9.1) also holds for level 1

twisted sl(3, C)e-modules (see [S]).

(iii) The character formula (10.4) is a generating function for numbers of colored
partitions in RR satisfying “diﬀerence D conditions”, and combined with the Weyl-
Kac character formula gives a Rogers-Ramanujan type identity.

11. Combinatorial bases of basic modules for C(1)

n

We ﬁx a simple Lie algebra g of type Cn, n ≥ 2. For a given Cartan subalgebra

h and the corresponding root system ∆ we can write

∆ = {±(εi ± εj) | i, j = 1, ..., n} \ {0} .

We chose simple roots as in [Bou]

α1 = ε1 − ε2, α2 = ε2 − ε3, · · · αn−1 = εn−1 − εn, αn = 2εn.

Then θ = 2ε1 and α⋆ = α1. By Lemma 7.5 for each degree m we have a space of
relations for annihilating ﬁelds

Q3(m) = U (g)q2θ(m) ⊕ U (g)q3θ(m) ⊕ U (g)q3θ−α∗ (m) .

The Weyl dimension formula for g gives

dim L(2θ) = (cid:18)2n + 3
4 (cid:19),
dim L(3θ) = (cid:18)2n + 5
6 (cid:19),

dim L(3θ − α⋆) =

(2n + 5)(n − 1)

3

(cid:18)2n + 3
4 (cid:19).

(11.1)

(11.2)

(11.3)

(11.4)

Hence we have

dim Q3(m) = dim L(2θ) + dim L(3θ) + dim L(3θ − α⋆) = 2n(cid:18)2n + 4
5 (cid:19).

For each α ∈ ∆ we chose a root vector xα such that [xα, x−α] = α∨. For root
vectors xα we shall use the following notation:

xij
xij
xij

or just

α = εi + εj , i ≤ j ,
α = −εi − εj , i ≥ j ,

With previous notation xθ = x11. We also write for i = 1, . . . , n

xii = α∨

i or just ii .

These vectors xab form a basis B of g which we shall write in a triangular scheme.
For example, for n = 3 the basis B is

13 23 33
13 23 33 33
12 22 32 32

21 11.

In general for the set of indices {1, 2, · · · , n, n, · · · , 2, 1} we use order

1 ≻ 2 ≻ · · · ≻ n − 1 ≻ n ≻ n ≻ n − 1 ≻ · · · ≻ 2 ≻ 1

and a basis element xab we write in ath column and bth row,

(11.5)

B = {xab | b ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n, n, · · · , 2, 1}, a ∈ {1, · · · , b}}.

By using (11.5) we deﬁne on B the corresponding reverse lexicographical order, i.e.

xab ≻ xa′b′ if b ≻ b′ or b = b′ and a ≻ a′ .

(11.6)
In other words, xab is larger than xa′b′ if xa′b′ lies in a row b′ below the row b, or
xab and xa′b′ are in the same row b = b′, but xa′b′ is to the right of xab.

For r ∈ {1, · · · , n, n, · · · , 1} we introduce the notation

△r

and r△

for triangles in B consiting of rows {1, . . . , r} and columns {r, . . . , 1}. For example,
for n = 3 and r = 3 we have triangles △3 and 3△

With order (cid:22) on B we deﬁne a linear order on ¯B = {x(j) | x ∈ B, j ∈ Z} by

(11.7)
With order (cid:22) on ¯B we deﬁne a linear order on P by

xα(i) ≺ xβ(j)

i < j

i = j, xα ≺ xβ.

π ≺ κ if

• ℓ(π) > ℓ(κ) or
• ℓ(π) = ℓ(κ), |π| < |κ| or
• ℓ(π) = ℓ(κ), |π| = |κ|, sh π ≺ sh κ in the reverse lexicographical order or
• ℓ(π) = ℓ(κ), |π| = |κ|, sh π = sh κ and colors of π are smaller than the

colors of κ in reverse lexicographical order.

Lemma 11.1. The set of leading terms of relations ¯R for level 1 standard ˜g-modules
consists of quadratic monomials

xa1b1 (−j)xa2b2(−j),

j ∈ Z,

b2 (cid:22) b1 and a2 (cid:23) a1,

16

MIRKO PRIMC AND TOMISLAV ˇSIKI ´C

and quadratic monomials

xa1b1 (−j − 1)xa2b2 (−j),

j ∈ Z,

b1 (cid:23) a2.

This lemma is a special case of Theorem 6.1 in [PˇS]. The proof for this level one
case reduces to a very simple argument.

Remark 11.2. Note that a quadratic monomial xa1b1 (−j − 1)xa2b2 (−j) is a leading
term of relation if and only if there is r such that

xa1b1 ∈ △r

and xa2b2 ∈ r△.

Theorem 11.3. The set of monomial vectors which have no leading term as a
factor, i.e., the set of vectors

(11.8)

u(π)1 ,

π ∈ RR,

is a basis of the basic ˜g-module L(Λ0).

Proof. By Proposition 10.1 and (11.4) it is enough to show

(11.9)

Xπ∈P 3(m)

N (π) = 2n(cid:18)2n + 4
5 (cid:19) .

In order to simplify the counting of embeddings of leading terms we introduce a
slightly diﬀerent indexation of a triangular scheme for a basis B. By using

(11.10)

k 7→ k k 7→ 2n − k + 1

and matrix notation for rows and columns we can rewrite the basis

B = {xk,l | k ∈ {1, · · · , 2n} , l ∈ {1, · · · , k}} .

We need to count embeddings in (11.9) for m = −3j − 1, −3j − 2 and −3j − 3,
that is, we need to consider three cases:

(I) xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2 (−j)xk3l3 (−j) where xk2 l2 (cid:22) xk3l3
(II) xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2 (−j − 1)xk3l3 (−j) where xk1 l1 (cid:22) xk2l2

(IIIa) xk1l1 (−j − 2)xk2l2 (−j − 1)xk3l3 (−j)
(IIIb) xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2 (−j − 1)xk3l3 (−j − 1) where xk1 l1 (cid:22) xk2l2 (cid:22) xk3l3 .
Denote by N the number of embeddings. During counting embeddings of leading
terms we need to multiply the count by a factor N − 1. We describe calculation of
the ﬁrst case in all details.

The ﬁrst case xk1l1(−j − 1)xk2l2(−j)xk3l3 (−j) where xk2l2 (cid:22) xk3l3 .
Depending on the type and number of embeddings the ﬁrst case is split in the
following ﬁve subcases:

(I1) N = 3; xk1l1 (−j−1)xk2l2(−j), xk1l1 (−j−1)xk3l3(−j) and xk2l2 (−j)xk3l3 (−j)

are leading terms (+ condition xk2l2 6= xk3l3)

(I2) N = 2; xk1l1 (−j−1)xk2l2(−j), xk1l1 (−j−1)xk3l3(−j) and xk2l2 (−j)xk3l3 (−j)

are leading term (+ condition xk2 l2 = xk3l3)

(I3) N = 2; xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2 (−j), xk1l1(−j − 1)xk3l3 (−j) are leading terms

and xk2l2(−j)xk3 l3(−j) not leading terms (+ condition xk2l2 6= xk3l3 )

(I4) N = 2; xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2(−j) not leading term, xk1l1(−j − 1)xk3l3(−j)

and xk2l2(−j)xk3 l3(−j) are leading terms (+ condition xk2l2 6= xk3l3 )

(I5) N = 2; xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2(−j) is leading term, xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk3l3(−j) not
leading term and xk2l2 (−j)xk3l3 (−j) is leading term (+ condition xk2l2 6=
xk3l3 )

Since the xk1l1(−j − 1)xk3l3 (−j) is not leading term then ♯ xk3l3 = k1 − 1 (see

Figure I4) and the sum PI4 is

Subcase (I5): Since in this subcase xk1l1 (−j − 1)xk2l2(−j) is not leading term then
we select entirely free the position of xk1 l1(−j − 1) ∈ △r and xk3l3(−j) ∈ r△. Then
the corresponding setting is

N = 2 ; xk2l2 ≺ xk3l3 ; xk1l1(−j − 1) ∈ △r ; xk3l3(−j) ∈ r△ .

In other two cases counting of embeddings of leading terms is similar and shows
(cid:3)

that (11.9) holds.

12. Combinatorial Rogers-Ramanujan type identities

As a consequence of Theorem 11.3 we have a combinatorial Rogers-Ramanujan
type identities by using Lepowsky’s product formula for principaly specialized char-
acters of C(1)

n -modules L(Λ0) (see [L] and [M], cf. [MP2] for n = 1)

This product can be interpreted combinatorially as a generating function for number
of partitions

of N with parts m satisfying congruence conditions.

(12.3)

fm = 0

if m ≡ 0, ±2 mod 2n + 4.

On the other hand, in the principal specialization e−αi 7→ q1, i = 0, 1, . . . , n, the

sequence of basis elements in C(1)

n

Xab(−1), ab ∈ B, Xab(−2), ab ∈ B, Xab(−3), ab ∈ B,

obtains degrees

|Xab(−j)| = a + b − 1 + 2n(j − 1),

where we prefer row and column indices of basis elements Xab ∈ B to be natural
numbers

b = 1, . . . , 2n,
For example, the basis elements for C(1)

a = 1, . . . , b.

As we see, there are several basis elements of a given degree m,

m = a + b − 1 + 2n(j − 1),

so we make them “distinct” by assigning to each degree m a “color” b, the row
index in which m appears:

For example, for n = 2 we have

mb,

|mb| = m.

so that numbers in the ﬁrst row have color 1, numbers in the second row have color
2, and so on. In general we consider a disjoint union Dn of integers in 2n colors,
say m1, m2, . . . , m2m, satisfying the congruence conditions

(12.7)

{m1 | m ≥ 1, m ≡ 1 mod 2n},
{m2 | m ≥ 2, m ≡ 2, 3 mod 2n},
{m3 | m ≥ 3, m ≡ 3, 4, 5 mod 2n},

. . .

{m2n | m ≥ 2n, m ≡ 2n, 2n + 1, . . . , 4n − 1 mod 2n}

and arranged in a sequence of triangles.

For ﬁxed m and b parameters a and j are completely determined. We see this

easily for the last row

2n2n, . . . , (4n − 1)2n; 4n2n, . . . , (6n − 1)2n; 6n2n, . . . ,

and then for all the other rows as well. So instead of mb we may write mab(−j).

Theorem 12.1. For every positive integer N the number of partitions

N = Xm≥1

mfm

with congruence conditions fm = 0 if m ≡ 0, ±2 mod 2n + 4 equals the number
of colored partitions

(12.8)

N = Xmb∈Dn

a′b′ (−j) such that b ≥ a′, or
a′b′ (−j) such that b ≤ b′, a ≥ a′.

For adjacent triangles corresponding to

. . . , Xab(−j), ab ∈ B, Xab(−j − 1), ab ∈ B,

. . .

in (12.4) and a ﬁxed row r ∈ {1, . . . , 2n} we consider the corresponding two trian-
gles: r△ on the left and △r on the right. For example, for n = 2 and the third row
we have r = 3 and two triangles denoted by bullets:

Then the ﬁrst diﬀerence condition does not allow two parts in a colored par-

tition (12.8) such that

a′b′(−j) ∈ r△ and mb = mab(−j − 1) ∈ △r.

On the other hand, the second diﬀerence condition does not allow two parts in a
colored partition (12.8) such that
b = m′

a′b′(−j), mb = mab(−j)
