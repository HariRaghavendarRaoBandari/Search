ABSTRACT

Low-mass, variable, high-velocity stars are interesting study cases for many aspects of Galactic structure and evolution. Until recently,
the only known high- or hyper-velocity stars were young stars thought to originate from the Galactic centre. Wide-area surveys like
APOGEE and BRAVA have found several low-mass stars in the bulge with Galactic rest-frame velocities larger than 350 km/s. In
this study we present the ﬁrst abundance analysis of a low-mass, RR Lyrae star, located close to the Galactic bulge, with a space
motion of ∼ −400 km/s. Using medium-resolution spectra, we derive abundances (including upper limits) of 11 elements. These
allow us to chemically tag the star and discuss its origin, although our derived abundances and metallicity, at [Fe/H] = −0.9 dex, do
not point toward one unambiguous answer. Based on the chemical tagging, we cannot exclude that it originated in the bulge. However,
combining its retrograde orbit and the derived abundances suggests that the star was accelerated from the outskirts of the inner (or
even outer) halo during many-body interactions. Other possible origins include the bulge itself, or the star could be stripped from a
star cluster or the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy when it merged with the Milky Way.

1. Introduction

RR Lyrae stars are short-period variables that are luminous,
old Population II stars, and therefore ideal for numerous as-
tronomical studies. Owing to their pulsations (with periods of
0.2–1 days) we can determine their distances via the period-
luminosity relation, while their high luminosity allows us to de-
tect them to greater distances in remote systems compared to
what is possible with fainter, less evolved dwarf and giant stars.
RR Lyrae stars have very compact centres containing most
of their mass while very little mass is found in the outer 50%
(in radius) of the star (Smith 1995). The RR Lyrae lie in the
instability strip on the horizontal branch and thus have tem-
peratures between 6100 - 7400 K. Most RR Lyrae stars are
on the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) which means they
are burning He to C in the core. In addition to the core burn-
ing H is fused to He in a shell. The exact chemical composi-
tion, especially the He content, will dictate the evolution and
pulsation properties of these variable stars (Smith 1995). De-
pending on how the RR Lyrae pulsate (fundamental note ver-

sus ﬁrst overtone) they are grouped in three subclasses (Bailey
types); RRab vs RRc where the former shows asymmetric light
curves with larger variations in magnitude compared to the lat-
ter c type which show more smooth low amplitude variations.
According to Smith (1995); Preston (2011) the typical pulsa-
tional velocity of RRab are 60 − 70 km/s (however, larger ampli-
tudes can be reached depending on the star’s V magnitude Liu
1991) while those of RRc only vary with 30 − 40 km/s. Finally,
the multi-mode RRd variables pulsate in both the fundamental
and the ﬁrst overtone and they compose the smallest subgroup
among these three types (Brown et al. 2004). Previous studies
(e.g., Clementini et al. 1995; For et al. 2011; Hansen et al. 2011;
Haschke et al. 2012) have shown that despite the evolved stage
of RR Lyrae stars, they seem to preserve the original surface
composition they were born with for most of the heavy elements
(except for lithium). This makes them excellent study cases for
chemical tagging in the Milky Way as well as in Local Group
galaxies (e.g., Brown et al. 2004; Da Costa et al. 2010).

Their age and low metallicity of the RR Lyrae stars make
them useful probes of the original chemical composition of the
old components of the Milky Way, namely the halo and bulge.
Layden et al. (1996) showed, using a kinematic study, that some
of the more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = −1.0) RR Lyrae stars belong
to the thick disk. This was conﬁrmed by the more recent North-
ern Sky Variability Survey (Kinemuchi et al. 2006) despite their
uncertainties in visual amplitudes and thus V magnitudes. An in-
dication of the Galactic component in which the RR Lyrae could

reside is given by the stellar metallicity. A [Fe/H]> −1.0 might
indicate that the star belongs to the thick disk or bulge, while a
lower value −1.0 to −2.5 would point towards it being an (in-
ner/outer) halo star. When looking towards the central regions of
the Milky Way, metallicity alone becomes an insuﬃcient param-
eter and large surveys have found an overlap of the bulge com-
ponent with the metal-weak thick disk and the inner halo (i.e.,
within 3.5 kpc, e.g., Fulbright et al. 2007; Kunder et al. 2012;
Ness et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2014). This distinction is sig-
niﬁcant, since the inside-out formation of the Galaxy dictates
that the oldest and most (extremely) metal-poor stars should be
found in the very center (Tumlinson 2010), rendering them in-
ner halo stars (by formation and chemistry) that happen to be
located within the bulge. In fact, while still low in numbers,
the very metal-poor “bulge” stars known to date show chemical
abundances that vastly overlap with those of the metal-poor halo
distribution (e.g., Casey & Schlaufman 2015; Koch et al. 2016;
Howes et al. 2015). Their kinematics then indicates that their or-
bits are mainly conﬁned to the inner few kpc of the Galaxy (al-
though the star we consider here is not conﬁned to the innermost
parts).

For this reason the high-velocity star (HVS) investigated in
Kunder et al. (2015) is of particular interest, since it turned out
to be a metal-poor RR Lyrae (type ab) star moving with a high
Galactic rest-frame velocity of −482 km/s on an eccentric orbit
around the bulge and into the halo. Previously, most of the high-
to-hyper-velocity stars were thought to be young (relatively mas-
sive) hot stars originating from the Galactic centre (e.g., Hills
1988; Brown 2015, and references therein). However, the re-
cent SEGUE study by Palladino et al. (2014) used a combina-
tion of radial velocities and proper motions to show that low-
mass F and G stars could be traveling with high enough speed
to allow them to escape the Galaxy, and that these stars did not
originate in the Galactic Centre (see also Kollmeier et al. 2010;
Nidever et al. 2012). Geier et al. (2015) conﬁrmed these ﬁndings
by conducting a kinematic and spectroscopic follow-up of the
fastest known HVS star which travels at ∼ 1200 km/s through the
Galaxy. Moreover, this star (US 708, a hot subdwarf), was found
to be a low-mass, compact He star that on top of its fast space
motion is also a fast rotator (Geier et al. 2015, and references
therein). The recent study by Li et al. (2015) found 19 HVS can-
didate stars in the ﬁrst LAMOST data release, and they suggest
that they may originate from the Galactic bulge. The work by
Kunder et al. 2016 (in press) also ﬁnds a subgroup of high ve-
locity RR lyrae stars in the bulge.

This makes the very evolved RR Lyrae star of Kunder et al.
(2015) an interesting study case, as it is to our knowledge the
ﬁrst high-velocity evolved RR Lyrae star to travel at high speed
between diﬀerent Galactic components (disk, bulge and halo).
Despite its current position close to the bulge, it is believed that
the RR Lyrae star (MACHO 176.18833.411) originates in the
halo, a conclusion reached by tracing back the calculated orbits.
Here we conduct a detailed medium-resolution follow-up study
of this star to trace and understand the origin of this high-velocity
RR Lyrae star.

2. Observations and data reduction

MACHO 176.18833.411 (hereafter m176) was observed three
times during 24 April 2015 using the Echellette Spectrograph
and Imager (ESI; Sheinis et al. 2002 ) at Keck II with a slit
of 0.5" resulting in a resolution of R ∼ 8000. Each exposure
lasted 1800 s and was obtained at phase 0.55 – 0.63 which co-
incides with the minimum light phase (for further details see

Article number, page 2 of 9

Table 1). This star has a stable period of 0.5152d according to
Soszy´nski et al. (2014) and Kunder et al. (2015). With an inte-
gration time of 1800 s, the observations last about 4% of the pul-
sation period. This is approximately a factor of three longer than
the integration times used in For et al. (2011), however, our inte-
gration times are still short enough to avoid smearing of the spec-
tra and the lines maintain a clean Gaussian proﬁle (see Fig. 1).
This star is fairly faint (< V >=17.586), which makes it hard to
obtain a high-resolution, high-S/N spectrum. The OGLE V and
I light curves, as shown in Kunder et al. (2015), clearly show
the characteristic asymmetric variations of an RR Lyrae ab type
variable.

Fig. 1: The spectral region of m176 around the Mg triplet. Over-
all the ﬁt is acceptable, however, we are biased towards measur-
ing strong lines which do not always yield the same abundance
as seen from weaker lines. A few of the weaker, yet blended,
Fe lines are shown here and marked with a ‘*’ (the two redmost
lines).

The data were reduced using the Makee pipeline1, which
conducts standard data reduction operatios such as bias subtrac-
tion, ﬂatﬁelding, wavecalibration including several wavelength
corrections, such as applying air-to-vacuum and heliocentric ve-
locity corrections. Since the spectra were obtained almost at the
same phase, the extracted 1D spectra could be co-added to a sin-
gle spectrum to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Follow-
ing the spectrum was shifted to rest wavelength and the contin-
uum was normalised in IRAF by dividing the spectrum with a
ﬁtted pseudo continuum. The ﬁnal spectrum spans a wavelength
range from ∼ 3800−11000Å. A SNR of ∼ 40 per pixel (or ∼ 130
per Å) was estimated from a spectral region around 7000 Å.

3. Stellar parameters and abundances

The stellar parameters were derived using only the spectra. As
a ﬁrst pass, we measured equivalent widths (EWs) for 17 Fe I
and four Fe II lines. These lines allowed for a ﬁrst rough deter-
mination of the stellar parameters. At this resolution, most Fe
lines are blended or too noisy to be useful for determining the
parameters (see Fig. 1), and we ended up with 13 Fe I and two

Fe II lines (see Table A.1). The remaining 15 useful Fe lines
were used to determine an excitation temperature by requiring
that all Fe I lines yield the same Fe abundance regardless of ex-
citation potential. The microturbulence velocity was set by re-
quiring that all Fe lines produce the same Fe abundance, and
the gravity was ﬁxed by changing this model parameter until
the same abundance values for Fe I and Fe II were obtained.
Since we only have two Fe II lines, this parameter is more uncer-
tain with respect to the other parameters that rely on Fe I mea-
surements. The value obtained for logg is however reasonable
for RR Lyrae stars. The metallicity was updated by synthesis-
ing weaker Fe lines, which yielded a somewhat lower [Fe/H]
value than derived from the strong EW measurements. The ﬁ-
nal set of stellar parameters is (T [K]/logg/[Fe/H]/ξmic [km/s]):
6600 ± 100/2.0 ± 0.3/ − 0.9 ± 0.2/4.5 ± 0.2.

In order to obtain an improved estimate of the gravity, we
use the Yale isochrones (Demarque et al. 2004) and an IDL pro-
gram by Yong et al. (2013). However, the program fails to re-
turn a value for this very evolved RR Lyrae star. The [Fe/H]
from weak line synthesis was conﬁrmed by measuring the bluest
Ca line (8498 Å) in the near-infrared Ca II triplet and insert-
ing the EW into the [Fe/H]-EW(Ca) relation of Gomez et al.
(2011); Wallerstein et al. (2012). Several independent EW mea-
surements yielded a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.85 ± 0.15 which
is in excellent agreement with the weak line value of [Fe/H]
= −0.9. The uncertainty in the Ca EW originates from con-
tinuum placement and to a lesser extent from the proﬁle ﬁtted
(Gauss versus Voigt – note that a Lorentzian should not be used
as it overestimates the EW and in turn the [Fe/H] value).

The stellar abundances were derived using an interpolated
new-ODF (new opacity distribution function) ATLAS9 model
atmosphere (Castelli & Kurucz 2003; Allende Prieto et al. 2004)
in conjunction with MOOG spectrum synthesis code (Sneden
1973, version 2014). We decided to only rely on spectral lines
in the region 5000 – 9000 Å in order to get the cleanest lines
(with fewest blends and lower noise) to derive the best possi-
ble abundances. This, on the other hand, also means that we are
using medium to strong lines for this analysis, since the spec-
trum quality prevents us from using weak lines. By conduct-
ing spectrum synthesis we determine abundances (including up-
per limits) for eleven elements which are listed in Table 2 (see
also Fig. 2). The lines to synthesise were selected from the line
list in Hansen et al. (2011) in order to ﬁnd the lines most likely
detectable in RR Lyrae stars. The synthesis was conducted us-
ing a line list containing atomic data from Sneden et al. (2014);
Hansen et al. (2013); Bergemann et al. (2012); Gallagher et al.
(2012); Ivans et al. (2006); Lawler et al. (2001).

From Table 2 and Fig. 2 the derived abundances and upper
limits for m176 are seen to be in good agreement with values
derived for other RR Lyrae stars. Comparing m176 to the bulge
study by Johnson et al. (2013) the abundances generally could
agree with those derived for bulge stars, however, the level of
α−enrichment also agrees well with values published for the
halo (Cayrel et al. 2004; Nissen & Schuster 2010). The Cr and
Si abundances of m176 are slightly lower than what is reported

for the bulge stars (Johnson et al. 2013). For the Cr abundance
we derived values for three lines, but one of them was more noisy
and yielded a diﬀerent value, which is why we only assigned this
line half weight when calculating the ﬁnal Cr abundance (hence
the 2.5 lines listed in Table 2). The only real outlier is the oxygen
abundance of m176. We used the O-triplet lines at 7774−7777 Å,
which are aﬀected by NLTE and 3D eﬀects (Caﬀau et al. 2008;
Nissen et al. 2014; Steﬀen et al. 2015; Amarsi et al. 2016). Both
corrections would need to be computed exactly for this star.
However, for the Sun the corrected Otrip abundances would in-
crease by ∼ 0.15 dex (Steﬀen et al. 2015), so if we corrected our
O abundance it would most likely still be lower than the abun-
dances derived for the other α−elements.

The abundances seem to indicate that this RR Lyrae star is a
rather normal halo star at [Fe/H] = −0.9 placing it in the more
metal-rich tail of the halo metallicity distribution (Schörck et al.
2009). However, the metallicity also matches the moderately
metal-poor stars in the bulge, where Li et al. (2015) recently
found 19 candicate HVS could originate from; for more details
see Sect. 4 and 4.2. The lines analysed and their atomic data are
presented in the online appendix (Table A.1).

Uncertainties

The abundance uncertainties arise from stellar parameters, con-
tinuum placement, and the quality of the spectral ﬁt which, ow-
ing to the SNR and the medium resolution, is of slightly lower
precision compared to high-resolution, higher SNR spectra. This
results in a line-to-line abundance variation of up to 0.2 dex, as
seen for Fe and <0.11 dex for Mg when using lines weaker than
the Mg triplet lines. (Fig. 1 shows that the strong Mg-triplet
lines are diﬃcult to ﬁt with one single abundance.) The stellar
parameter uncertainties of ±100K/±0.3/±0.2/±0.2km/s result in
an abundance uncertainty of ∼ 0.13 − 0.2 dex depending on the
element. The uncertainty related to the continuum placement is
typically 0.05 and for the spectrum ﬁt it varies from higher SNR
to lower SNR regions from 0.02 – 0.1 dex. By adding all the un-
certainties in quadrature we obtain a total uncertainty of 0.16 –

0.22 dex. For simplicity we adopt an average value of 0.2 dex for
all elements in the ﬁgures.

we now check if pulsations combined with the high velocity can
lead to mass loss from the stellar surface.

Helium

Escapevelocity

The He I line at 5875.6 Å is an interesting absorption feature
as it would tell us about the helium abundance in the star. The
amount of helium is a governing factor in the pulsation and evo-
lution of very evolved stars (such as RR Lyrae stars). The layer in
which helium is being doubly ionised is responsible for absorb-
ing heat during the stellar compression, and, in turn, for driving
and maintaining the pulsations in the so-called γ-mechanism.
However, the helium line is only visible in the maximum light
phase (0.9-1.0), and since we have observed this RR Lyrae at
minimum light, this line is unfortunately not detectable. More-
over, He I and II emission lines are also visible in the rising light
phases or close to the peak, and the line strengths depend on the
pulsation period, velocity amplitude, and metal abundance (for
more details on He line behaviour see Preston 2011).

3.1. Impactofmicroturbulence

Compared to other, less evolved stars the RR Lyrae stars have
high microturbulences, ξmic. Moreover, the medium resolution
and a SNR∼ 40 prevents us from using weak lines, hence we
suspect a few of the strongest lines to be close to saturation.
A higher microturbulent velocity could therefore help desatu-
rate the lines and this would in turn provide more reliable abun-
dances. We therefore test the impact of using Kurucz models
with new opacity distributions, created with microturbulences
of 2, 4, and 8 km/s. The changes are not detectable for most of
the lines we analysed. A few of the stronger, and more sensi-
tive, lines show changes of around 0.05 dex, and in those cases
we produce lines where the Gaussian synthetic line proﬁles are
better broadened and therefore ﬁt the observed spectrum better.
However, thermal broadening remains most important at these
temperatures (which are also somewhat higher in RR Lyrae than
in dwarfs and giants). Only the strongest lines like the Na D lines
show very large diﬀerences when synthesized with a microtur-
bulence of 8 km/s compared to 4 km/s. These lines are aﬀected
by the outer regions of the stellar atmospheres, where the T-p
(temperature-pressure) proﬁles of the diﬀerent models (in ξmic)
diﬀer the most. The Na D lines were diﬃcult to ﬁt, and possibly
saturated, so we do not give this result too much weight, which
is why our [Na/Fe] is an upper limit.

4. Results and Discussion

In order to understand the origin and enrichment of this high
velocity RR Lyrae star we must ﬁrst analyse and interpret our
derived surface abundances. Evolved horizontal branch and RR
Lyrae stars have proven to be trustworthy study cases in galac-
tic archeology studies (e.g., Tautvaisiene 1997; Preston et al.
2006 as well as the two most metal-poor RR lyrae stars studied
Hansen et al. 2011). However, when evolved and expanded giant
stars move with high velocities through the ambient interstellar
medium they might become subject to mass loss, if the outer
layers are not strongly bound (this is, e.g., the case for the lumi-
nous, low-gravity, variable Mira stars, where material from the
outer layers are being removed by ram pressure stripping, e.g.,
Martin et al. 2007). Given the compactness of RR Lyrae stars,
this is unlikely to be of a concern even in fast-moving ones.
But before drawing any conclusions based on the abundances

Article number, page 4 of 9

Is material being stripped from this HVS RR Lyrae star or does
it stay bound? As mentioned in the introduction, the outermost
50% by radius of a typical RR Lyrae star contains ∼0.001 M⊙
which could in principle be stripped from the star. If we assume
a typical RR Lyrae star mass of 0.65–0.8 M⊙ and a radius of
4–6 R⊙, we adopt a mass of 0.7 M⊙ and a radius of 5 R⊙ (Smith
1995; Catelan 2015)2. These allow us to calculate the escape
velocity from the stellar surface using:

Vescape = p2 G M/R = 231.2 km/s

The expansion velocity of the outer layers, in turn, can be
deduced from the change in velocity along the line of sight from
phase 0 to 0.5 which corresponds to the change from minimum
radius to maximum radius. According to the Liu (1991) pulsa-
tional velocity amplitude vs V light amplitude relations, a veloc-
ity of ∼ 90 km/s was estimated based on m176’s V-band am-
plitude of 1.27 mag (see Fig. 1 in Liu). Thus for m176, this
value is Vexpansion ∼ 90 km/s (see Fig. 1 in Kunder et al. 2015).
This means that Vexpansion << Vescape and the surface material
will stay bound owing to the relative compactness of this class
of stars (as conﬁrmed by earlier RR Lyrae star abundance stud-
ies). This conﬁrms that the surface abundances reﬂect the origi-
nal chemical composition and have not been stripped or altered
owing to the combination of the pulsational and high spatial ve-
locity of the star.

HighVelocityStars

As mentioned in the introduction, the ﬁrst HVSs to be detected
were massive, hot stars that originated from the Galactic cen-
tre (Hills 1988). Recent studies (e.g., Palladino et al. 2014) have
shown that low-mass F or G stars can also travel with extremely
high velocities, often exceeding the local Galactic escape veloc-
ity. Thus, stars in a cluster or a binary system can be kicked
out e.g., by a perturbation of the system, such as in a three-
body encounter or a supernova explosion (e.g., Hoogerwerf et al.
2000; Perets 2009; Irrgang et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2013). To
be more speciﬁc, there are several possible formation scenarios
for HVSs: 1) interaction of single-stars with a central massive
black hole (MBH), 2) tidal break-up of binary stars in the vicin-
ity of a MBH, 3) three-body interactions involving single-star
encounters with a binary or cluster of MBHs, 4) double detona-
tion of SN Ia with a close system of a rapidly orbiting low-mass
compact He star and a massive (∼ 1 − 1.2M⊙) CO-white dwarf
(Geier et al. 2015), 5) single degenerate SN type Ia consisting of
a white dwarf and main sequence star (Liu et al. 2013), 6) binary
star disruption in dense, interacting regions like globular clusters
or the Galactic bulge/disk, or 7) tidal disruption of dwarf galax-
ies in the Galaxy (Li et al. 2015, and references therein). The last
case would lead to old rapidly traveling stars.

In all the scenarios involving a binary system, we would ex-
pect some pollution or mass transfer to have taken place. This
could possibly change the original surface composition by en-
hancing the He, carbon and possibly the neutron capture element

2 With these or slightly lower values we would get a logg of ∼ 2.5
which is slightly higher than what we derive from the spectra. This is
an expression of the few strong lines we had to rely on and the bias of
LTE Fe abundance.

abundances. If the star were to be kicked out of a cluster some
slow neutron-capture pollution might be expected. We could de-
rive neither molecular nor atomic C from the medium-resolution
spectra as the star is warm (6600K) and the blue spectra are very
noisy, but our spectra would still have allowed us to detect signif-
icant C-enhancement. Moreover, the [Ba/Fe] abundance is low,
and when comparing this to Fig. 5 in Stancliﬀe et al. (2013) the
mass transfer, if it occurred, would have been much lower than
0.1 M⊙. Thus the surface composition of m1763 would only have
been aﬀected by a negligible amount in the measurable element
abundances.

4.1. Metallicity:Lightcurvevs.spectroscopicmeasurements

All of our spectroscopic measurements are in excellent internal
agreement with each other: based on a representative number of
16 Fe I lines we found [Fe/H] =−0.90 ±0.2 dex, which compares
to the well-calibrated Ca triplet measurement of [Fe/H]CaT =
−0.85 ± 0.15 dex. In contrast, the photometrically derived metal-
licity values suggest this star is considerably more metal-poor. A
Fourier decomposition of the OGLE I-band light curve and the
Smolec (2005) Fourier-[Fe/H] calibration yields a photometric
metallicity of −1.26 dex on the Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) metal-
licity scale, or −1.52 dex on the Carretta et al. (2009) metal-
licity scale. Kunder et al. (2015) performed a Fourier decom-
position on the OGLE V-band light curve and used the widely
adopted Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) Fourier-[Fe/H] calibration to
ﬁnd a photometric metallicity of −1.62 dex on the Carretta et al.
(2009) metallicity scale with a deviation parameter4 Dm = 3.6.
Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) cautioned that relating physical stellar
properties to Fourier parameters is applicable and "reliable" only
if Dm < 3, although some studies have relaxed this criteria to Dm
< 5 (e.g., Cacciari et al. 2005). The disagreement between the
spectroscopic and photometric [Fe/H] may indicate that careful
consideration of the deviation parameters of (bulge) RR Lyrae
stars needs to be taken, which is a limitation when using the
Smolec (2005) calibration, as it does not provide a way to cal-
culate a deviation parameter and hence excludes such a ‘sanity’
check. Ultimately, a larger sample of stars with well determined
spectroscopic metallicities is needed to clarify the discrepancy
between our spectroscopic and the photometrically determined
[Fe/H].

The accuracy of photometric metallicities derived from the
light curve Fourier parameters is not well established for the RR
Lyrae population in the direction of the bulge. We note that ours
is the ﬁrst medium-resolution spectroscopic study of a RR Lyrae
star in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Kunder & Chaboyer
(2008) ﬁnd that a star-to-star comparison between photomet-
ric metallicity of bulge RR Lyrae stars in Baade’s Window
and those from low-resolution spectroscopic metallicities of
Walker & Terndrup (1991) have a dispersion twice as large as
what would be expected from the Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) cali-
brating sample. In contrast, the photometric [Fe/H] determina-
tions of LMC stars compared to that of low-resolution spec-
troscopy agree to within 0.2 dex. It has also been shown that
Fourier components of the light curves of RR Lyrae stars in the
metal-rich bulge clusters NGC 6411 and NGC 6388 give photo-
metric metallicity values that are 0.6 dex more metal-poor than

3 This star may be part of the high velocity dispersion subgroup of RR
Lyrae stars in the bulge (Kunder et al. 2016, subm.).

what is spectroscopically observed (Sandage 2004). This may
indicate that RR Lyrae stars toward the direction of the bulge
have properties distinct from the majority of local ﬁeld RR Lyrae
stars that make up the photometric [Fe/H] calibrating sample
(e.g., diﬀerent α−abundances, helium abundances, or evolution-
ary channel), rendering the photometric [Fe/H] values for these
stars uncertain.

4.2. Chemicalinferencesonthebirthplaceofm176

Using the Besançon model of the Milky Way (Robin et al. 2003),
we ﬁnd that no halo RR Lyrae star more metal-rich than −1.3 dex
should be found towards this direction toward the bulge. As is
known, from stellar population synthesis, it is not as common for
RR Lyrae to be produced from metal-rich systems, so the prob-
ability of metal-rich RR Lyrae forming in a metal-poor system
like the halo is low (Lee 1992; Layden 1995). So if this star is not
a typical bulge object, but a halo star as indicated by kinematics,
then the Galactic halo model implies that an RR Lyrae star with
a relatively high metallicity so close to the bulge suggests that it
could have an extragalactic origin.

The orbits presented in Kunder et al. (2015) seem to indi-
cate that the star (m176) would originate from the halo and
is presently passing through the bulge. However, we do not
know if it came from the outer or inner halo, or if, as the
authors suggest, the star is less likely to originate from the
bulge. A low or high α−abundance allows us to distinguish be-
tween the outer and inner halo (Nissen & Schuster 2010) pop-
ulation. The inner halo shows a metallicity distribution func-
tion peaking around <[Fe/H]>∼ −1.6 with stars on prograde
orbits that are thought to reﬂect the old(est) population of the
Galaxy, while the outer halo is found to have an even lower
mean metallicity with stars on retrograde orbits (Carollo et al.
2007). The latter could point towards stars being stripped from
dwarf galaxies as a result of a galaxy merger where smaller sys-
tems were absorbed into the Galaxy. In either case, the outer
halo is nowadays believed to be built up from smaller sub-
systems (Bullock & Johnston 2005), which would have limited
gas resources, thus a diﬀerent initial mass function for systems
with a lower mass than that of the Milky Way. This would, in
turn, lead to lower α−abundances (e.g., Kobayashi et al. 2006;
Nissen & Schuster 2010). Similarly, the low star forming ef-
ﬁciencies of the dwarf galaxy satellites in question lead to a
downturn in the [α/Fe] ratios already at low [Fe/H], again leav-
ing the impression of strong α-depletions towards higher metal-
licities (e.g., Matteucci & Brocato 1990; Tolstoy et al. 2009;
Hendricks et al. 2014). Hence, a low [Mg/Fe] (∼ 0.2 dex) in a
star on retrograde orbits could point towards an external origin
of a star that is now located in the outer halo, while a high (∼ 0.4)
[Mg/Fe] in a star on a prograde orbit would indicate an old pop-
ulation formed in situ (inner halo).

Nissen & Schuster (2010) presented a large sample of stars
from the thick disk, inner and outer halo, all observed at high
resolution. We compare the abundances of our RR Lyrae star
(m176), which we showed to represent the original birth compo-
sition and remain unmodiﬁed by the stellar evolution and high
velocity, to the study of Nissen & Schuster (2010). Figure 3
shows this comparison for [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe].

This RR Lyrae star lies right between the inner halo and thick
disk stars on one hand and the outer halo stars on the other hand.
In the [Mg/Fe] panel of Fig. 3 the RR Lyrae star (m176) might be
slightly closer to the inner halo/thick disk stars. In (Nissen et al.
2014) C and O abundances were presented for the same sam-
ple as published in their 2010 paper. The oxygen abundance

Fig. 2: Abundances of m176 compared to other RR Lyrae stars observed in a similar phase (around minimum light) as well as bulge
stars. The RR lyrae star studies shown are: Clementini et al. (1995); For et al. (2011); Hansen et al. (2011); Kolenberg et al. (2010);
Haschke et al. (2012) and Johnson et al. (2013) as bulge comparison sample.

we ﬁnd fall ∼ 0.4 dex below their lowest outer halo O abun-
dances. Hence, we need to consider the stellar kinematics to de-
termine whether the star is moving on an prograde or retrograde
orbit. As in Nissen & Schuster (2010) we construct a Toomre di-
agram, where we also compare to their data. The result is shown
in Fig. 4, from which it is clearly seen that m176 moves on a
retrograde orbit that is even more extreme than the stars from
Nissen & Schuster (2010). This indicates that the high velocity
RR Lyrae star, m176, originated from a not too remote part of
the outer halo (this is also feasible compared to the orbit pre-
dictions provided in Kunder et al. 2015). The fact that the star
moves with such a high velocity could indicate that it was orig-
inally kicked out from a binary system or that it is a result of a
galaxy merger event, where a dwarf galaxy would be incorpo-
rated into the Milky Way and some of the dwarf’s stars would
be stripped in the process. This could explain the kinematics and
velocity of the RR Lyrae star m176.

According to de Boer et al. (2015) the ﬁrst stripping from
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy resulted in stream stars with a

mean metallicity of ∼ −1.5 around 11–13 Gyr ago, while a sec-
ond, more metal-rich stream (∼ −0.7) is younger (∼ 5Gyr; see
also Fellhauer et al. (2006)). The fact that RR Lyrae are gener-
ally old Pop II stars is consistent with them being stripped from
a dwarf galaxy (e.g., Sgr) in an early merger event since the age
(> 10Gyr) would allow the star to have been stripped early on. In
addition to this, the earlier study by Monaco et al. (2007) showed
that there is a southern and a northern stream which peak around
< [Fe/H] >= −0.61 and < [Fe/H] >= −0.83, respectively.

In addition, they also found an increasing α−abundance
trend with decreasing metallicity for both the Sgr stream and
main body. Their [Mg/Fe] values span values from ∼ −0.3 to
0.4 dex. By combining the fact that RR Lyrae stars are thought
to belong to an old population, that the Sgr stream consists of
older and younger streams peaking at diﬀerent mean metallici-
ties close to the [Fe/H] = −0.9 we obtained for m176, and that
positive (almost halo-like) [Mg/Fe] values can occur; the strip-
ping from Sgr option remains a viable origin of m176. In fact,
an extragalactic origin has been proposed for peculiar HVSs in

Lastly, we consider that m176 is a “normal” RR Lyrae star
located towards the direction of the bulge, which is on the tail of
the RR Lyrae star velocity distribution. Its spectroscopic [Fe/H]
is what is expected for a RR Lyrae stars located toward the
bulge (e.g., Walker & Terndrup 1991; Pietrukowicz et al. 2015)
as is its distance from the Galactic center. Although it has a
halo-like orbit, it may well be that the majority of “bulge”
RR Lyrae stars reside in an inner halo (e.g., Minniti et al.
1999; Kunder & Chaboyer 2008). This is also suggested by
their spatial distribution (Dékány et al. 2013, although see also
Pietrukowicz et al. 2015). A larger sample of spectroscopically
well-studied bulge RR Lyrae stars, as well as a larger sample of
bulge RR Lyrae stars with space velocities is needed to address
the uniqueness of this star.

5. Conclusion

The high velocity RR Lyrae star, m176, seems at ﬁrst glance to
be a normal halo star from a chemical perspective with a slight
α−enhancement, a normal Cr and Ba abundance and upper limits
that agree well with our understanding of the halo stars and their
chemical imprints. It is remarkable to ﬁnd a variable star from an
old population with a space velocity of −482 km/s with respect to
the Galactic rest frame. It has completed many orbites around the
bulge during its lifetime, hence repeated passages through/near
the bulge, and yet, despite variability and high velocity, it pre-
served the original birth composition for the elements studied
here.

The α−abundances are in good agreement except for O
which needs to be consolidated from high-resolution follow-
up spectroscopy. However, all α−abundances are ≤ 0.3dex and
combined with the LSR velocity this indicates that the star is
likely a halo star on a retrograde orbit, which associates it with
the outer halo. Thus, this star could through stellar interaction
originate from a binary system that interacted with a massive
object, a binary system residing in a stellar cluster at the verge
of the inner/outer halo region, or from dense parts of the bulge
where interactions are more frequent. In all cases, a higher den-
sity will lead to more frequent interactions as well as a higher bi-
nary fraction. The normal Ba abundance and the lack of C seems
to go against this explanation in terms of a binary origin. How-
ever, based on the metallicity and α−abundances we cannot de-
termine at this point if the star was stripped from a system in the
halo or the bulge. Interactions with a binary system, stellar clus-
ter or a dense region in either of these two Galactic components
could result in a HVS. Given the metallicity of ∼ −1 and the cur-
rently growing population of HVS RR Lyrae stars near the bulge
– this would speak in favour of a bulge origin. Another possible
explanation for the origin of m176 is that it was tidally stripped
from a diﬀerent galaxy (a dwarf or an early merger event such
as Sgr) which is supported by the age and the stellar abundances
(low O and Ti).

Higher resolution spectra of this star as well as other low-
mass HVS stars would allow us to perform a more detailed abun-
dance analysis, including weaker lines, of this and similar stars
so that we can look deeper into their formation and origin. This
will be important to understand if there is a population of (HVS)
RR lyrae stars in the bulge region.
