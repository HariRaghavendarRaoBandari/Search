Abstract

We show that there is no (95, 40, 12, 20) strongly regular graph
and, consequently, there is no (96, 45, 24, 18) strongly regular graph,
no two-graph on 96 vertices, and no partial geometry pg(5, 9, 3). The
main idea of the result is based on the star complement technique and
requires a small amount of computation.

Introduction

A k-regular graph of order v is said to be (v, k, λ, µ) strongly regular (SRG
in short) if for any two distinct vertices x, y ∈ V (G) the intersection N (x) ∩
N (y) has cardinality λ if x and y are adjacent and µ otherwise. While
there are certain necessary conditions on v, k, λ, µ there is no general way
to determine whether a (v, k, λ, µ) strongly regular graph exist for a given
choice of v, k, λ and µ. For example, at the time of writing this article, the
existence of a (65, 32, 15, 16) SRG is not settled and is in fact the smallest
case for which the existence of a SRG is not known. See Brouwer’s web-page
[7] for the current state of aﬀairs on the classiﬁcation of SRG’s as well as [8]
for the current initiative of bringing Brouwer’s classiﬁcation into Sage.

Given the diﬃculty of providing a general answer to the existence
of strongly-regular graphs, many results targeting speciﬁc parameters ac-
cumulated over the years.
For example, Haemers showed [12] that
there is no (76, 21, 2, 7) SRG while Degraer ruled out [10] the existence
of a (96, 38, 10, 18) SRG. The problem of determining the existence of

1

(75, 32, 10, 16) and (95, 40, 12, 20) strongly-regular graphs was given a par-
ticular signiﬁcance in [11] for two reasons. On one hand, they fall into
the small class of unresolved cases having less than 100 vertices. Second,
the (non-)existence of (95, 40, 12, 20) strongly-regular graphs determines the
(non-)existence of (96, 45, 24, 18) strongly regular graphs as well as of the
(non-)existence of so called two-graphs on 96 vertices [11, Chapter 11]. Ad-
ditional signiﬁcance is given by the property that the non-existence of this
graphs implies non-existence of so called partial geometry pg(5, 9, 3) (for
the details, see [5]). Certain structural results for this graphs were obtained
through the years. In particular, for a (95, 40, 12, 20) SRG X it was shown
by Makhnev [13] that it does not contain a 20-regular subgraph while Be-
hbahani and Lam [3] showed that the only prime divisors of |Aut(X)| are 2, 3
and 5. A recent result also showed that an independent set of X can only
have cardinality 18. Indeed, if X had an independent set S of size 19, then
the graph X \ S would have been a (76, 30, 8, 14) SRG (see Theorem 9.4.1
in [6]), but the non-existence of a (76, 30, 8, 14) SRG was recently settled by
Bondarenko, Prymak and Radchenko [4].

In [2] we showed that there is no (75, 32, 10, 16) strongly-regular graph.
In this paper we continue our work and use the developed approach to show
the infeasibility of the parameter (95, 40, 12, 20). The outline of the proof
is surprisingly similar to what is presented in [2] and therefore, for the sake
of brevity, we give a slightly shorter overview of the tools that we use, and
refer the reader to [2] for additional references.

2 Preliminaries

In what follows X will denote a (95, 40, 12, 20) strongly regular graph. The
idea of our approach is based on three steps. First, we build a list of graphs
L such that at least one member of L is an induced subgraph of X.
In
addition every graph in L has precisely 20 vertices and does not have 2 as
an eigenvalue - we call such graphs star complements. In the second part we
compute the so called comparability graphs for graphs in L. For our purposes
a comparability graph is a graph with vertex set

V (comp(H)) = {u ∈ {0, 1}n−k | hu, ui = 2 and hu,

−→
1 i = −1} ,

and adjacency deﬁned as

u ∼ v ⇐⇒ hu, vi ∈ {−1, 0} ,

where AH is the adjacency matrix of H. Finally, for every such comparability
graph we show that its clique number is smaller than 75. The theory of star

2

complements then guarantees that X does not exist. See [9] for a general
overview of the star complement technique and [14] for an application of
this approach for classifying (57, 14, 1, 4) SRG’s.

In order to be able to build a small enough list L we use a well-known
interlacing criterion explained in [2]. This is possible since eigenvalues of
strongly-regular graphs are easy to compute:
in particular, X must have
eigenvalues 40, 2, −10 of multiplicities 1, 75, 19, respectively, see [7].

Since the interlacing criterion is by far not suﬃcient, we additionally
need to prove certain structural results about X. This is done in the next
section. Some of the lemmas that follow, rely on small Sage programs that
generate certain induced structure of X. Every statement indicating that it
was obtained computationally is marked in Table 1 that also lists the name
of the corresponding Sage program used in the proof. All the programs
and source code used in the paper can be obtained on the author’s GitHub
page [1].

3 Clique structure of X

The well known Hoﬀman’s inequality [11, pp. 204] bounds the size of a in-
dependent set in a regular graph with a given least eigenvalue. In particular
for our SRG X, Hoﬀman’s bound implies that X must have maximal inde-
pendent set of size 5, thus the clique number of X is at most 5. In addition,
the recent bound on the number of 4-cliques of a strongly-regular graph [4]
implies that the clique number of X is either 4 or 5. In this section we will
show the following:

Proposition 1. If X exists, its clique number is 5. Moreover, every 4-clique
of X is contained in a 5-clique.

Suppose that X has a 4-clique K4 that is not contained in a 5-clique
of X and let ~b = (b0, b1, b2, b3) be a vector where for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 we
denote by bi the number of vertices of V (X) \ V (K4) having precisely i
neighbors in K4. As it was explained and used in [2], a formula from [4]
gives possible candidates for ~b.
In particular, in graph X it must hold
~b ∈ {(3, 28, 60, 0), (1, 34, 54, 2), (2, 31, 57, 1), (0, 37, 51, 3)}.
In the next four
subsections we analyze each possibility for ~b showing that a (95, 40, 12, 20)
SRG with such a conﬁguration does not exists.

3.1 Case (3, 28, 60, 0)

Let us denote with X0, X1, X2 the subsets of vertices in V (X) \ V (K4) that
have, respectively, 0, 1, 2 neighbors in K4. Moreover, denote the vertices in
X0 by x1, x2, x3.

Lemma 1. Every vertex in X2 has precisely two neighbors in X0.

Proof. Let xi ∈ X0. We use an argument that will be repeatedly used in
this paper. Since xi is not adjacent to any of the vertices in K4 it has to
have 20 common neighbors (since X is strongly regular with µ = 20) with
each vertex of K4. Thus there are 4 · 20 paths of length 2 from xi to K4.
On the other hand, xi has 40 neighbors (X is 40-regular) in X0 ∪ X1 ∪ X2.
All the neighbors are in fact in X2, for otherwise they could not form 80
2-paths to K4. Since for j ∈ {1, 2, 3} \ {i} we have |N (xi) ∩ N (xj )| = 20 and
|N (xi)| = 40, it follows

60 ≥ |N (x1) ∪ N (x2) ∪ N (x3)| = 3 · 40 − 3 · 20 + |N (x1) ∩ N (x2) ∩ N (x3)| ,

by the inclusion-exclusion principle. Thus N (x1) ∩ N (x2) ∩ N (x3) = ∅.

Therefore every vertex in X2 is adjacent to precisely two vertices in X0.

For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3 let Xi,j ⊆ X2 be the set N (xi) ∩ N (xj). By the

previous lemma, this sets are disjoint of order 20.

Lemma 2. Each of the graphs X[X1,2], X[X1,3] and X[X2,3] is a disjoint
union of cycles. Moreover the graph X[X1,2 ∪ X1,3 ∪ X2,3] is 22-regular.

Proof. Let v be a vertex of X1,2. We count the number of 2-paths from v to
K4. Since it is adjacent to 2 vertices of it, there must be 2 · 12 + 2 · 20 such
paths. Denote with k the number of neighbors of v in X2. By the previous
lemma, v is adjacent to 2 vertices in X0, thus it is adjacent to 40 − 2 − 2 − k
vertices in X1. Now we count 2-paths:

2 · 12 + 2 · 20 = 2k + 1(40 − 2 − 2 − k) + 0 · 2 + 2 · 3 .

Therefore, v has k = 22 neighbors in X2, and since it is not adjacent to
x3 it must have 20 neighbors in X2 − X1,2 = N (x3). This implies that v has
precisely 2 neighbors in X1,2.

In [13] it was shown that if graph X exists, then it does not have a
20-regular subgraph. Consider the induced subgraph on X2 and remove the
disjoint unions of cycles in X1,2, X1,3, X2,3. We obtain a 20-regular subgraph
and hence this conﬁguration is impossible.

4

3.2 Case (1, 34, 54, 2)

Let X0, X1, X2, X3 be the sets of vertices having 0, 1, 2, and 3 neighbors in
K4, respectively. In particular, let x0 ∈ X0 and x1 6= x2 ∈ X3.

Lemma 3. Vertices x1 and x2 are not adjacent.

Proof. Suppose x1 ∼ x2. There are up to isomorphism only two possible
induced graphs on K4 ∪ {x1, x2}. Moreover, if we add the vertex x0 we
obtain 6 candidate graphs for an induced subgraph of X. None of them
interlaces X, which was checked by a Sage program listed in Table 1.

Lemma 4. Vertex x0 is adjacent to both vertices in X3. Moreover, it has 2
neighbors in X1 and 36 neighbors in X2.

Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose x0 is adjacent to k ∈ {0, 1}
vertices of X3. Let t be the number of neighbors of x0 in X1. By double
counting 2-paths from x0 to K4 we obtain:

4 · 20 = 3k + t + 2(40 − k − t) ,

which gives that k = t. Without loss of generality suppose that x1 is not
adjacent to x0. By counting the number of 2-paths in a similar way we
obtain that x1 has 10 neighbors in X2. But by strong regularity, x0 and x1
must have 20 common neighbors which is not possible since x0, x1 can share
at most k ≤ 1 common neighbors in X1 and 10 common neighbors in X2.
Hence x0 is adjacent to both x1 and x2 and so k = t = 2 and the claim
follows.

In virtue of Lemma 4, let x′

0, x′′

0 be the vertices in X1 that are adjacent

to x0.

Lemma 5. Each vertex x1, x2 has 11 neighbors in X2.

Proof. The lemma follows by double counting 2-paths to K4.

Lemma 6. For i = 1, 2, the vertex xi is adjacent to at least one of the
vertices in {x′

0, x′′

0}.

Proof. By Lemma 5, the vertex xi has 11 neighbors in X2. Since xi is
adjacent to x0, by Lemma 4, it has 12 common neighbors with x0. Thus it
must be adjacent to at least one of x′

0, x′′
0.

Let X −0

2 be the set of vertices in X2 that are not adjacent to x0. Notice

that by Lemma 4, |X −0

2 | = 54 − 36 = 18.

is adjacent to x1, and at most

Proof. Vertex x1 shares at most 2 common neighbors with x0 in X1 (possibly
0 or x′′

0). Thus it must have at least 10 out of 11 neighbors (Lemma 5) in
X2 adjacent to x0. By symmetry, the same claim holds for x2.

that are adjacent to exactly one of the vertices

First, assume it is not adjacent to x1 or x2. Then their common neighbors

2-paths from v to K4 we obtain that v has 20 neighbors in X2. Thus,

its degree in X2 is 18. Thus it’s degree in X −0

is 18 − (19 − t) = t − 1.

Finally, if v is adjacent to x1 and x2, it has degree 16 in X2, thus all

satisfying the structure described in this section.

3.3 Case (2, 31, 57, 1)

Let X0 = {x0, x1}, X1, X2, X3 = {x3} be the sets of vertices having 0, 1, 2,
and 3 neighbors in K4 respectively.

Lemma 10. We have x0 6∼ x1.

Proof. If x0 ∼ x1 then the number of 2-paths from x0 to K4 is at most
3 + 2 · 38 = 79. But since x0 is not adjacent to any vertex of K4, it should
have precisely 4 · 20 2-paths to it.

Lemma 11. x0 ∼ x3 and x1 ∼ x3.

Proof. Suppose x0 is not adjacent to x3 and let N0, N1, respectively, be the
sets of neighbors of x0, x1 in X2. By double counting 2-paths to K4 from x0
and x1 we have |N0| = 40 while |N1| = 40 − 2t where t ∈ {0, 1} depending
on whether x1 is adjacent to x3 or not. Since all the neighbors of x0 are in
X2, we have |N0 ∩ N1| = 20. But this implies |N0 ∪ N1| = 60 − 2t ≥ 58
which is not possible as X2 has cardinality 57.

In
Lemma 12. Vertices x0 and x1 have precisely one neighbor in X1.
particular, the two neighbors are distinct. Moreover, both x0 and x1 have 38
neighbors in X2, 19 of them in common.

Proof. Let t be the number of neighbors of x0 in X1. By counting 2-paths
from x0 to K4 we have

20 · 4 = 3 + t + 2 · (40 − 1 − t) ,

which gives that t = 1, and x0 has 38 neighbors in X2. Same holds for x1.
Let again N0, N1 be the sets of neighbors of x0, x1 in X2. Then |N0 ∪ N1| ≤
57, thus |N0 ∩ N1| ≥ 19. Since x0 and x1 have a common neighbor x3,
|N0 ∩ N1| = 19 and |N0 ∪ N1| = 57. In particular this implies that x0 and
x1 cannot have a common neighbor in X1.

The last two lemmas now imply that X2 can be partitioned into sets

Proof. Vertex x3 has 12 neighbors in X2. On the other hand, it must have

Proof. Pick a vertex v ∈ X 0
2 and let s ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether v is adjacent
with x′
1. Similarly, let t ∈ {0, 1} indicate if v it is adjacent with x3. Let r be
the number of neighbors of v in X2. We count the number of 2-paths from
v to K4:

2 · 12 + 2 · 20 = 2 · 3 + 3t + 2r + (40 − 2 − t − r − 1) .

Thus r = 21 − 2t. Vertex v and x1 must have 20 common neighbors. This
2 is 20 − t − s. We
implies that the number of neighbors of v in X
have that v has (21 − 2t) − (20 − t − s) = 1 − t + s neighbors in X 0
2 which
proves our lemma.

interlaces X.

2 ∪ {x0, x1, x′

1, x3} ∪ K4

3.4 Case (0, 37, 51, 3)

Let again X1, X2 and X3 = {x0, x1, x2} be the respective subsets of vertices
of X with 1,2,3 neighbors in K4. There are three non-isomorphic ways to in-
troduce 3 vertices to K4 by joining each vertex to 3 vertices of K4. Each such
graph G1, G2, G3 can be uniquely described by a tuple ~n = (n1, n2, n3, n4)
counting the number of edges from the i′th vertex of K4 to X3. By relabeling
the vertices of K4 if needed we obtain three tuples (0, 3, 3, 3), (1, 3, 3, 2) and
(2, 2, 2, 3) which we will cover as subcases. In what follows we ﬁrst establish
certain structural claims about the conﬁguration (0, 37, 51, 3).

Lemma 15. The vertices of X3 form an independent set.

8

Proof. No matter how we introduce edges among the vertices of X3 in the
graph K4 ∪ X3 we do not obtain a graph interlacing X.

Lemma 16. Every vertex x ∈ {x0, x1, x2} has 27 neighbors in X1 and 10
neighbors in X2.

Proof. Let x have k neighbors in X1 and l = 40 − 3 − k neighbors in X2. We
count the number of paths of length 2 from x to K4. We have 3 · 12 + 20 =
3 · 3 + k + 2 · (40 − k − 3) and thus k = 27 and l = 10.

Let X 0

2 , X 1

2 , X 3

have proved that |X 0
need not be disjoint.

2 be the neighbors in X2 of x0, x1, x2 respectively. We

2 | ∈ {0, 1}.

Proof. Vertices x0 and x1 have 20 common neighbors, at least 2 of them are
on K4. Each of x0, x1 has 27 neighbors in X1, where |X1| = 37. Thus they
must have at least 17 common neighbors in X1. The latter implies that
they have at most one common neighbor in X2. By symmetry the claim
now holds for |X 0

2 | and |X 1

Lemma 18. For i ∈ {1, 2} the graph induced by X 0

2 \ X i

2 is triangle-free.

2 \ X i

Proof. Assume that there exists a triangle in X 0
2. Together with x0
it forms a K4. Assume this K4 does not extend to a K5. Vertex xi is not
adjacent to any of the vertices of this K4. Thus we have a case of K4 with
some vertices that are not adjacent to it. We have already shown that this
is not possible. On the other hand, if K4 extends to a K5, we have a K5
and a vertex that is adjacent to at most one vertex on it. This is impossible,
since if X has a 5-clique K5 then using the formula of [4] for K5, as we did
for K4, gives us that every vertex in V (X) \ K5 has precisely two neighbors
in K5.

Let X −0

1 | = 27, thus |X −0

Proof. By Lemma 16, |X 0
1 | = 10. For i ∈ {1, 2}, xi and x0
share at least 2 neighbors on K4. Since they are non-adjacent, they share
20 neighbors, thus at most 18 in X1. This implies |X 0
1| ≤ 18, thus
|X 0
1| ≥ 27 + 27 − 18 = 36. Since |X1| = 37 we see that there exist at
most one vertex in X1 that is not adjacent to x0 and not to xi.

1 ∩ X i

1 ∪ X i

1 \ X i

If there is a triangle in the graph X −0

1, this triangle forms a K4 with
x0, while xi is not adjacent to any of its vertices. If this 4-clique is not a
part of a 5-clique the assertion follows since this case has already been dealt
with (a K4 with some vertices not adjacent to it). On the other hand, if
this K4 is a part of a K5, we have an induced subgraph of K5 together with
a vertex that is adjacent to one or none of the vertices on K5. But every
vertex in V (X) \ V (K5) has two neighbors in V (K5) as in Lemma 18. A

contradiction. Hence X

is indeed triangle-free.

Let now v ∈ X −0

neighbors in X1. By counting 2-paths to K4 we get

12 + 3 · 20 = 3 + 3t + j + 2(40 − 1 − t − j),

hence j = 9 + t. Denote with l the number of neighbors of v in X 0

The case analysis carried out in this section resulted in 203 graphs, 190
of them having a star complement as an induced subgraph. The remaining
13 had a subgraph of order 19 with no 2 as eigenvalue. Such subgraphs
were extended in all possible ways and a ﬁnal list of 3225 star complements
was obtained. By computing the respective comparability graphs and their
clique numbers we have determined that none of them has clique number
larger than 74. Hence we deduce Proposition 1.

4 Main result

Let K5 be a 5-clique of X with vertex set {k1, . . . , k5}. As already mentioned
in Lemma 18, results from [4] imply that every vertex of X that is not in
K5 has precisely two neighbors in K5. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 5, let Xi,j be
vertices in V (X)\V (K5) that are adjacent to ki and kj. Since ki and kj
are adjacent, they must have 12 common neighbors, 3 of them already on
K5. Hence V (G) \ V (K5) is partitioned into 10 sets of 9 vertices, namely
X0,1, X0,2, . . . , X4,5.
In what follows we establish structural results about
these partitions.

Lemma 21. For any 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 5 the graph Xi,j is either K9 or K3 ∪ K6
or K3 ∪ K3 ∪ K3 or K3 ∪ K3 ∪ K3.

Proof. Assume there exists an edge e = {x, y} in the graph Xi,j. Then the
vertices {x, y, ki, kj} induce a 4-clique. By the result of the previous section,
every 4-clique is contained in a 5-clique. Clearly, the additional vertex must

11

be in Xi,j. Hence we have proved that every edge e in Xi,j is contained in
a triangle in Xi,j. Let T be a triangle in Xi,j and v ∈ Xi,j a vertex not on
T . Since T ∪ {ki, kj} induces a 5-clique, every vertex not on this 5-clique is
adjacent to exactly 2 vertices on this clique. Since v is adjacent to ki and
kj, it is not adjacent to T and the lemma follows.

As it turns out every pair of triangles in distinct partitions Xi,j, Xk,l

induce quite a regular structure.

Lemma 22. Let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 5, 1 ≤ k < l ≤ 5 and let T, T ′ be two triangles
of Xi,j and Xk,l, respectively. Let c = |{i, j, k, l}|. If c = 3, then the edges
from T to T ′ form a perfect matching. If c = 4, they form a complement of
a perfect matching.

Proof. First assume c = 3. Since T ∪ {ki, kj} forms a 5-clique, every vertex
of T ′ is adjacent to exactly 2 vertices in this 5-clique. Since c = 3, it must
be adjacent to exactly one vertex in T . Similarly, every vertex of T must be
adjacent to exactly one vertex in T ′. Thus, the edges from T to T ′ form a
perfect matching. The case when c = 4 is similar.

Our next lemma shows that not all partitions Xi,j contain a triangle. In

fact at most 7 do.

Lemma 23. There are at least three distinct pairs {i, j}, {k, l}, {m, n} such
that Xi,j , Xk,l and Xm,n are independent sets of X.

Proof. Using Lemma 22 and Lemma 4 we wrote a Sage program generat-
ing all possible graphs on {k1, . . . , k5} and 8 triangles, each contained in a
diﬀerent set Xi,j, for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 5. There are 2 non isomorphic ways to
chose 8 sets for triangles (among 10 sets). All the obtained graph in one
conﬁguration do not interlace X, while in the other conﬁguration only one
graph was found giving rise to 209 comparability graphs. None of them has
a clique of order 75. Thus the lemma follows.

Theorem 1. The graph X does not exist.

Proof. With the help of McKay’s program genbg we generated all graphs of
the form X1,2 ∪ X2,3 ∪ K5, assuming X1,2 and X2,3 are independent sets. By
constructing star complements from the obtained graphs we obtained a list
of 3998479 graphs. By checking the respective comparability graphs it turns
out that none of the them has a 75 clique, hence proving our claim.

5 Final remarks

The presented arguments for the non-existence of a (95, 40, 12, 20) are almost
the same as the one used in showing the non-existence of a (75, 32, 10, 16)
SRG. What is interesting is that in the case of a (95, 40, 12, 20) SRG the
computational aspect is signiﬁcantly smaller. Indeed it takes only about 2
weeks of CPU time on a standard desktop machine to run the computational
parts of the presented result. The two main reasons for this is that the target
star complements of (95, 40, 12, 20) have small order (relative to the order
of X). Finally, when computing the respective clique numbers it is much
easier to prove that the comparability graphs do not have a clique of order
75 as opposed to 56 in the case of a (75, 32, 10, 16) SRG.
