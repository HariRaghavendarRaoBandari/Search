ABSTRACT

DXL (Diﬀuse X-ray emission from the Local Galaxy) is a sounding rocket mission designed to quantify and charac-
terize the contribution of Solar Wind Charge eXchange (SWCX) to the Diﬀuse X-ray Background (DXB) and study
the properties of the Local Hot Bubble (LHB). The detectors are large-area thin-window proportional counters with
a spectral response similar to that of the PSPC used in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). A direct comparison of
DXL and RASS data for the same part of the sky allowed us to quantify the SWCX contribution to all 6 RASS bands
(R1-R7). We ﬁnd that the SWCX contribution at l = 140◦, b = 0◦, where the DXL path crosses the Galactic plane is
32% ± 12%(statistical) ± 5%(systematic) for R1, 45% ± 8% ± 5% for R2, 22% ± 11% ± 4% for R4, 14% ± 12% ± 4%
for R5, and negligible for R6 and R7 bands. We can also estimate the contribution to the whole sky. We ﬁnd that the
average SWCX contribution in the whole sky is 25% ± 10% ± 7% for R1, 30% ± 6% ± 6% for R2, 9% ± 5% ± 2% for
R4, 7% ± 5% ± 1% for R5, and negligible for R6 and R7.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) provides the best
maps of the soft diﬀuse X-ray background (Snowden
et al. 1997). The angular structure of the emission is
consistent with previous maps of the diﬀuse background
but with superior statistics, and after more than 20 years,
they are still the benchmark for all diﬀuse emission stud-
ies.

4 keV (R12) and the 3

However, during the course of the six-month survey it
became apparent there was a signiﬁcant source of back-
ground that was strongly variable on a time scale of ∼12
hours which showed up in the 1
4 keV
(R45) bands (Snowden et al. 1994). The source was un-
known, but since the time variation was short compared
to the observing time for each part of the sky, these “long-
term enhancements” (LTEs) could be empirically sub-
tracted. The excellent agreement with the zero points
of earlier surveys gave some conﬁdence that there were
no large residuals (Snowden et al. 1995). Much later
(after the discovery of X-ray emission from comets), it
was recognized that the LTEs were largely due to Solar
Wind Charge eXchange (SWCX) with atomic hydrogen
in the outermost parts of the Earth’s geocorona (geocoro-

nal SWCX)(Cravens et al. 2001; Lallement 2004; Snow-
den et al. 1994; Cox 1998).
It was soon realized that
there would also be SWCX on interstellar neutral H and
He passing through interplanetary space (Heliospheric
SWCX), and that the much slower time variations in this
component largely precluded its being removed in the
survey analysis (Cox 1998). As a result, all subsequent
studies of soft X-ray background using ROSAT data and,
by extension all other observations, are plagued by the
uncertainty of an unknown SWCX contribution. Studies
suggest that geocoronal and heliospheric SWCX emission
could produce little to all of the observed diﬀuse X-ray
emission (Cravens et al. 2001).

Accurate separation of the Galactic and SWCX con-
tributions to the ROSAT maps is essential to our un-
derstanding of diﬀuse X-ray emission and the structure
of the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood
(Cravens et al. 2009). However despite numerous eﬀorts
an accurate estimation of the heliospheric SWCX con-
tribution has been hindered by the poorly known cross
sections for producing the many X-ray lines from SWCX,
limited data on heavy ion ﬂuxes in the Solar Wind, and
the general spectral similarity of SWCX and thermal
emission (Cravens 2000; Lallement 2004; Koutroumpa
et al. 2006; Snowden et al. 2009; Henley & Shelton 2008;
Crowder et al. 2012; Yoshino et al. 2009).

It is generally accepted that the Diﬀuse X-ray Back-
ground (DXB) observed in the R12 and R45 bands orig-
inates in the following sources:
i) geocoronal and he-
liospheric SWCX, ii) a ∼ 100 parsec (pc) scale million-
degree interstellar plasma in the Local Hot Bubble
(LHB), iii) the 1.5 − 3 × 106K plasma of the Galactic
Halo (GH), and iv) resolved and unresolved extragalactic
sources, including the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium
(Williamson et al. 1974; Sanders et al. 1977; Bloch et al.
1986; McCammon & Sanders 1990; Burrows & Menden-
hall 1991; Fabian & Barcons 1992; Gupta & Galeazzi
2009; Galeazzi & Gupta 2009). Most of the emission
above 1 keV is attributed to the resolved and unresolved
extragalactic point sources well characterized by a power
law model (Mushotzky et al. 2000). A signiﬁcant por-

tion of the emission observed in the Galactic plane in
the R12 band is thought to come from a combination of
SWCX and the LHB, with some contribution from the
more distant sources, particularly at higher Galactic lat-
itudes since soft emission is easily absorbed by interstel-
lar neutrals (McCammon & Sanders 1990). In the fairly
isotropic R45 band, most of the emission is attributed to
the hot gas of the Galactic disk and halo plus a contribu-
tion from SWCX (Smith et al. 2006; Henley & Shelton
2013; Liu et al. 2016).

Calculations show that the SWCX could generate any-
where from 25 to 100% of the R12 and the R45 band
emission (Cravens et al. 2001; Robertson & Cravens 2003;
Koutroumpa et al. 2006, 2007, 2009). In the R45 band,
the SWCX emission was believed bright enough to ac-
count for most of the emission in the plane of the galaxy
where the LHB is least extended (Koutroumpa et al.
2009). Recent measurements indicate that SWCX con-
tributes about 40 % (Galeazzi et al. 2014) and 29%
(Smith et al. 2014) of the R12 band on the Galactic
planes, with the rest attributable to LHB emission.

There are also various estimates of SWCX contribution
to the OVII and OVIII line ﬂux, which partly contribute
to the 3
4 keV band emission. Koutroumpa et al. (2007)
calculated an OVII intensity of 0.3 - 4.6 LU and an OVIII
intensity of 0.02 - 2.1 LU in front of several clouds ob-
served by XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, and used
a time-dependent model of the SWCX to show that the
charge exchange emission was bright enough to account
for the observed intensity. Smith et al. (2006) found 3.5
LU and less than 0.34 LU of OVII and OVIII respectively
in front of a dense molecular cloud, due to LHB and/or
SWCX. Henley & Shelton (2008) estimate 3.8±0.5 LU
(OVII) and 1.4±0.3 LU (OVIII) from SWCX emission.
Gupta et al. (2009) found that during multiple obser-
vations of the same shadowing target, OVII ﬂux varied
between 1.5±0.61 LU and 4.14±0.90 LU, most likely due
to SWCX. Snowden et al. (2009) observed 2.1±1.1 LU
(OVII) and 1.9±0.5 LU (OVIII) at 2σ and 4σ conﬁdence
level respectively from the helium focusing cone in the
heliosphere. Yoshino et al. (2009) estimated 2 LU inten-
sity of OVII due to SWCX. Koutroumpa et al. (2011)
found that SWCX can account for 46% of OVII emis-
sion (0.82 LU) using XMM-Newton observation of the
molecular cloud MBM 12 combined with SWCX models.
Crowder et al. (2012) set an upper limit of 1.2 LU OVII
intensity from heliospheric SWCX.

Here we report the result of the DXL sounding rocket
mission (Galeazzi et al. 2011, 2012; Thomas et al. 2013;
Galeazzi et al. 2014; Uprety 2015), in which we deter-
mine the remaining contributions from SWCX to each
individual RASS band. In section 2 we brieﬂy describe
the characteristics of the DXL mission, in section 3 we
focus on the data analysis, section 4 contains the result
of the investigation, and conclusions are discussed in sec-
tion 5.

2. DXL

The technical details of the DXL mission were de-
scribed in Galeazzi et al. (2011). DXL is a sounding
rocket mission to measure the parameters of the LHB
and SWCX through the spatial signature of their emis-
sion. The main instrument is the DXL detector, which
is composed of two large area (1, 000 cm2 total area)

Fig. 1.— DXL CI (red) and CII (blue) grasp (eﬀective area times
solid angle).

Fig. 2.— We matched DXL bands (dotted) as closely as possi-
ble to the ROSAT bands (solid) for direct comparison. The DXL
bands are labeled as D1 (black), D2 (red), D4 (green), D5 (blue),
D6 (cyan) and D7 (magenta) in correspondence to ROSAT’s R1
(black), R2 (red), R4 (green), R5 (blue), R6 (cyan) and R7 (ma-
genta) bands. The bands are deﬁned by the grasp (a product of
eﬀective area to solid angle in cm2sr as a function of energy.

thin window proportional counters that provide excellent
counting statistics when scanning the sky in the limited
observing time of a sounding rocket ﬂight. In particular,
the DXL grasp at 0.65 keV, the energy of the OVIII line,
is about 7.5 cm2sr (600 cm2 eﬀective area, 6.5◦ × 6.5◦
FOV). The grasps of the two DXL counters are shown
in Figure 1. The payload also carried the ﬁrst prototype
of a wide ﬁeld-of-view soft X-ray camera using microp-
ore reﬂector technology (Collier et al. 2015). DXL was
successfully launched from White Sands Missile Range
in New Mexico on December 12, 2012.

The DXL instrument was inherited and refurbished
from the Wisconsin All Sky Survey program (McCam-
mon et al. 1983). The DXL payload consists of two thin-
windowed, large area proportional counters mounted on
an aluminum frame and supported by the rocket skin.
The counters use a wire-wall design and are ﬁlled with
P10 gas (90% Argon, 10% methane) at about 800 Torr.
The X-rays are mechanically collimated using 2.5 cm
thick, 3 mm cell honeycomb providing a circular ﬁeld of
view of 6.5◦ FWHM. Ceramic magnets embedded in the
collimator provide a magnetic ﬁeld of 150 Gauss within
and above the collimators which intercept electrons that
could either generate scattered X-rays or mimic X-ray
events in the detectors. The detector employs a three-
sided veto for cosmic-ray rejection using anodes at the
sides and back of each main counter.

∼25 km s−1 through the solar system due to the motion
of the Sun through a small interstellar cloud. This ma-
terial, mostly hydrogen atoms with about 15% helium,
ﬂows from the Galactic direction (l,b)∼(3◦,16◦), placing
the Earth downstream of the Sun in early December.
The trajectories of the neutral interstellar helium atoms
are governed primarily by gravity, executing hyperbolic
Keplerian orbits and forming a relatively high-density fo-
cusing cone downstream of the Sun about 6◦ below the
ecliptic plane. Interstellar hydrogen, on the other hand,
also experiences signiﬁcant impact from radiation pres-
sure and ionization, creating a neutral hydrogen cavity
around the Sun, with negligible focusing.
To maximize the signal from SWCX, DXL started
scanning from l = 140◦, b = 0◦, to l = 185◦, b = −17.5◦
and returned, to scan through the predicted location of
the He focusing cone twice (Figure 3).
It then per-
formed a fast 360 degree scan of the sky to normalize
the data outside the cone and to estimate the instru-
ment background (while looking at the Earth). After the
fast scan, the mission again performed two slow scans
between l = 185◦, b = −17.5◦, and l = 140◦, b = 0◦
(Galeazzi et al. 2014). Figure 4 shows the center of the
DXL scan path as a function of time during launch.

3. DATA ANALYSIS

Both DXL and ROSAT measured a combination of
SWCX and non-SWCX emission. For the December 2012
DXL observation, the Earth was in the He focusing cone
and the line of sight was chosen to pass through the dens-
est part of the focusing cone. The ROSAT observation in
the same direction, taken from the ROSAT All-Sky Sur-
vey would have been made in September of 1990, when
the Earth-Sun line was perpendicular to the He focusing
cone. That line of sight did not pass through the focusing
cone (although it did, like all lines of sight include he-
liospheric SWCX emission). Thus the DXL and ROSAT
data contain the same cosmic emission but very diﬀerent
SWCX emission. Given a model of the neutral density
distribution in the heliosphere and measurements of the
solar wind ﬂux during both observations, one can solve
for the true cosmic emission.

The DXL scan path is designed to run close to the
Galactic plane, to minimize any non-local contribution to
the diﬀuse X-ray emission. For both DXL and ROSAT,
the observed ﬂux (F ) contains contributions from the
heliospheric SWCX (S(t)) and the non-SWCX (Mostly
LHB - L). The ROSAT data may also include residual
Geocoronal SWCX (G), while any Geocoronal contribu-
tion to DXL is negligible due to the look direction, which
is directly away from the Sun. We can therefore write the
ﬂux for each mission as:

FRASS((cid:96), b) =SRASS((cid:96), b, t) + LRASS((cid:96), b) + G
FDXL((cid:96), b) =SDXL((cid:96), b, t) + LDXL((cid:96), b)

(1)

where the SWCX count rate S((cid:96), b, t) is the integral along
the line of sight of the product of ion ﬂux, neutral den-
sities, cross sections for producing charge exchange, and
the eﬃciency summed over all of the lines that fall within
the bandpass:

map shows the central region of the cone, with the colorscale cor-
responding to the He density distribution weighted by one over the
distance from the Sun squared ( 1
R2 ) to reﬂect the dilution of the
solar wind as it ﬂows outwards.

Fig. 4.— DXL scan path shown as a function of time in Galactic

co-ordinates.

One side of each counter,

facing the mechanical
collimators,
is covered with a thin X-ray window
(25 cm × 50 cm). For the ﬁrst DXL ﬂight, we used
thin (80-90 mg cm−2) plastic windows supported by a
25 µm thick, 100 lines-per-inch nickel mesh to retain the
counter gas while allowing soft X-ray photons to enter
the counter. The windows are composed of Formvar
(C5H7O2, the registered trade name of the poly-vinyl
formal resin produced by Monsanto Chemical Company)
with an additive, Cyasorb UV-24 (C14H12O4, a trade
name of American Cyanamide), to absorb stellar ultra-
violet photons that could otherwise generate a large non-
X-ray background. Geometrical eﬀects, including the
shadow of the nickel mesh, anticoincidence detectors, col-
limators, magnets, and masks near the ends of the anode
wires reduce the eﬀective aperture of each detector to
about 600 cm2. While the energy resolution of the pro-
portional counters is relatively poor below 1 keV, the car-
bon edge at 0.285 keV in the ﬁlter response allows a clear
separation of the events into diﬀerent bands, roughly cor-
responding to those used for the ROSAT All Sky Survey.
Figure 2 shows the normalized DXL (D1-D7) and RASS
(R1-R7) bands for comparison.

To separate the SWCX contribution from the other
components of the DXB, the DXL mission uses the spa-
tial signature of SWCX emission due to the “He focus-
ing cone”, a higher neutral He density region downwind
of the Sun (Michels et al. 2002; Snowden et al. 2009;
Thomas et al. 2013). Neutral interstellar gas ﬂows at

R2 ds is the integrated neutral column density
along the line of sight, weighted by one over the distance
from the Sun squared ( 1
R2 ) to reﬂect the dilution of the
solar wind as it ﬂows outward. Note that in the equation
above, the assumed stationarity of the ion ﬂux is an ap-
proximation because the ﬂux is known to vary strongly
on timescales of about a day. These ﬂuctuations, how-
ever, are smoothed when averaging over the few-week
transit time through the relevant interplanetary region,
as is evident from the very good agreement between sky
surveys performed by diﬀerent missions in diﬀerent years
(Snowden et al. 1995).

For simplicity, we can rewrite Eq. 4 in terms of two

Direct comparison of DXL and RASS count rates
would require, in general, detailed instrument responses
as well as the spectral shape of the emission. However,
because the DXL and RASS responses are very similar,
the ratio can be parametrized by a single parameter. For

Fig. 5.— DXL/ROSAT rate vs R2/R1 ratio for the R12 band.
The red dots are for counter 1, blue for counter 2. The DXL rates
were calculated by folding various thermal and abundances models
for a wide range of temperatures of the unabsorbed component (to
cover the widest range of ROSAT R2/R1 ratio) through the DXL
response. The temperature and normalization of the absorbed
component, and the photon index and normalization of the power
law were ﬁxed to the best ﬁt values obtained by ﬁtting ROSAT
data at the center of the DXL slow scan region.

example, the ratio between the DXL D1+D2 and the
RASS R1+R2 count rates is adequately parameterized
as a function of R2/R1, almost independently of the un-
derlying spectral model or abundance ratios. The DXL
to RASS count rate conversion was calculated from spec-
tral model ﬁts to the RASS data along the DXL scan
path. That model included an unabsorbed thermal com-
ponent (SWCX+LHB), an absorbed thermal component
(Galactic halo), and an absorbed power law (unresolved
point sources). We evaluated the neutral hydrogen col-
umn density value, required to model the absorption co-
eﬃcient, using the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS)
100 µm data. For the contribution of unresolved point
sources, we used a power law with photon index ﬁxed at
1.4 (Masui et al. 2008; Yoshino et al. 2009). For the un-
absorbed component, we tested the APEC, MEKAL and
Raymond-Smith thermal models11, and Savage & Sem-
bach (1996) and Anders & Grevesse (1989) abundance
models. Once we had determined the best ﬁt, we var-
ied the foreground LHB+SWCX component over a wide
range of temperatures and abundances to determine the
dependence of the conversion function from ROSAT to
DXL (D) upon R2/R1 (Fig. 5). Similar procedures have
been used for the individual R1 and R2 band, R4 and
R5 (using the R5/R4 ratio), and R6 and R7 (using the
R7/R6 ratio).

We can then rewrite Eq. 1 as:
FRASS((cid:96), b) = βRASS(t)× NRASS((cid:96), b) + LRASS((cid:96), b) + G

FDXL((cid:96), b) =C × D×

ferences between the laboratory measured response func-
tion and the ﬂight one (should be consistent with 1),

for each band as a function of Galactic longitude (a good
proxy for scan path) using 1 degree bin along the slow
scan path, and 5 degree bins along the fast scan path. We
also extracted ROSAT data in the six bands for direct
comparison with DXL. ROSAT rates were weighted over
the DXL collimators in 0.1 s steps for the duration of
the whole DXL ﬂight, they were then combined into the
same set of longitude bins used for DXL. Following the
ﬁtting procedure of Galeazzi et al. (2014) we performed a
contemporaneous ﬁt to both DXL counters using Eqs. 8
and 9. We used, as free parameters the constants Ci and
Cii for each counter, the solar wind condition ratio R,
and the SWCX parameter βRASS. The ROSAT (solid
blue line) count rates for R1, R2, R4 and R5 bands, and
DXL (black dots) count rates for D1, D2, D4 and D5
bands are plotted against Galactic longitude in ﬁgures
6 through ﬁgure 9. The respective ﬁgures also show
the best ﬁt lines (solid red ) to DXL data, along with
SWCX contributions to DXL (dashed red) and ROSAT
(dashed blue) bands. Since the RASS data as published
no longer contain the point sources, point source count
rates were added to the ROSAT rates prior to data ﬁtting
to account for the contribution of the point sources to the
DXL rates.

4. RESULTS

The result for the combined RASS R12 band have
already been reported and discussed in Galeazzi et al.
(2014). Here we report our results on all the RASS
individual bands and their implications.
In Galeazzi
et al. (2014), two possible contributions from geocoronal
SWCX and two diﬀerent ratios of H to He compound
cross-sections were used.
In this work, we also tested
diﬀerent values of the contribution G from geocoronal
SWCX to the individual R1 and R2 bands, and we tested
diﬀerent values of the H to He compound cross-section ra-
tio αH
from 1 to 5, as there is theoretical indication that
αHe
the ratio may be much higher (Vasili Kharchenko, pri-
vate communication). What we found is that, while the
diﬀerent values of G and the diﬀerent ratios have a sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect on individual ﬁtting parameters, when the
parameters are combined to determine the total SWCX
contribution, the results are similar. As a consequence,
from here on, we decided to show one nominal set of val-

aThe R12 and R45 results come from independent ﬁts of the data in the two combined bands and are consistent with the sum of the
SWCX contribution from the individual bands.

in the systematic error.

As expected, the SWCX contribution to the RASS R6
and R7 bands was found to be compatible with zero. As
a consequence, for the rest of this paper, we focus only
on the R1-R5 bands. The ﬁtting parameters obtained
in all the bands are presented in Table 1. The table
shows the representative data for the condition when the
ratio of H to He cross-sections was 2 and the geocoronal
contribution was assumed to be 50RU for the R12 band
- evenly split between the two bands - and 0 RU for the
R45 band. As we previously discussed, changes in the
results due to diﬀerent assumptions are included in the
systematic error. Following the same convention used in
Galeazzi et al. (2014), the parameters Ci and Cii are the
ratios of the ﬁtted DXL response to the nominal value
from laboratory conditions for the two DXL counters.

To better understand the contribution of SWCX to the
RASS bands and, more in general to the diﬀuse X-ray
emission, we use the parameters from Table 1 to calcu-
late both absolute (in RU) and fractional SWCX rates.
In particular, in Table 2 we report the SWCX contribu-
tion at l ∼ 140.5o, b ∼ 0, which is were the DXL scan
path intersects the Galactic plane. This is a point in-
dicative of the total SWCX contribution on the Galactic
plane, and can be directly extrapolated from the DXL
results. We also used the expected distribution of neu-
tral H and He from Koutroumpa et al. (2006) to estimate
the average SWCX contribution over the whole sky. We
note that, from Koutroumpa et al. (2006), the average
over the whole sky of the H and He neutral density dis-
tribution is 0.011 cm −3 AU−1 and 0.021 cm−3 AU−1
respectively.

Although we used an independent (and slightly dif-
ferent) procedure to reduce the data, the results in
the combined R12 band are consistent with those al-
ready reported in Galeazzi et al. (2014).
In the R12
band, we ﬁnd that the total SWCX contribution is
131RU ± 14RU (statistical) ± 9RU (systematic) at the
Galactic plane. The combined SWCX contribution is

38% ± 4% ± 3% of the ROSAT count rate at the loca-
tion. An all-sky average puts the count rate of SWCX
at 166RU ± 20RU ± 31RU , which is 27% ± 3% ± 5%.
The Aitoﬀ-Hammer projection of SWCX contribution in
the RASS R12 band is presented in Figure 10. We have
also removed the SWCX contribution from RASS, and
the “updated” ROSAT R12 map is shown in Figure 11.
In the R45 band, SWCX contributions at the Galactic
plane is 7RU ± 4RU ± 1RU , eﬀectively 14%± 7%± 2% of
the observed ROSAT counts. When averaged across the
whole sky, SWCX contribution is 10RU ± 5RU ± 2RU,
or 6% ± 3% ± 1% of the observed rates. The contribu-
tion is certainly not enough to account for all or even
the majority of the total emission in the band as pre-
dicted by some calculations. Most importantly, it seems
that SWCX contributes only a small fraction of the total
diﬀuse emission on the Galactic plane. Non-local compo-
nents, such as Galactic Halo and non-Galactic emission
also provide a negligible contribution to the RASS bands
on the Galactic plane due to neutral hydrogen absorp-
tion. Similarly, the LHB is too cold to contribute signif-
icantly to the R45 band. Using the average temperature
of 0.0903 keV for the LHB, and an emission measure
of 2.55 × 10−3 cm−6 pc from Liu et. al.
(in prepa-
ration), we calculated that the LHB contributes about
6 RU to the R45 on the Galacti plane, which is ∼ 4% of
the average ROSAT rate on the plane. The origin of the
bulk of R45 emission on the Galactic plane thus remain
an open question. It seems that an additional, not yet
identiﬁed source of X-rays must be responsible for about
90% of the total emission on the Galactic plane in the
R45 band. This is a long-standing issue in X-ray astron-
omy, pre-dating the discovery of SWCX (McCammon &
Sanders 1990). Our results conﬁrm that SWCX does
not account for the unexplained emission. The Aitoﬀ-
Hammer projection of SWCX contribution to the RASS
R45 band is presented in Figure 12. We updated the
ROSAT R45 map by removing the SWCX emission as
shown in Fig. 13. Notice that the contribution from
SWCX is very small, and its eﬀect on the RASS map

is barely noticeable.

We also used the “AtomDB Charge Exchange (ACX)”
model (Smith et al. 2014) to estimate the OVII and
OVIII line contributions due to SWCX. Speciﬁcally, we
performed a global ﬁt to our estimated SWCX contribu-
tion to the R1-R5 bands with “solar wind temperature”
(i.e., the temperature of the solar corona responsible for
the solar wind) and normalization as free parameters.
We ﬁnd a solar wind temperature of 1.24± 0.08× 106 K,
within the range of temperatures obtained by Smith
et al. (2014), which gives an OVII/OVIII ratio of 86.
If we assume that the SWCX contribution to the R45
band is dominated by these two lines, this would corre-

spond to OVII and OVIII emissions of 3.2 ± 1.7 LU and
0.037±0.020 LU respectively, which represent upper lim-
its to the oxygen lines emission.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Using data from the DXL sounding rocket mission, we
quantiﬁed the SWCX contribution to the diﬀuse X-ray
background and, speciﬁcally, to the RASS bands. The
contribution was removed from the RASS maps to pro-
duce ”clean” maps of the extra-solar diﬀuse emission.
We also found that, while LHB and SWCX contribute to
the totality of the diﬀuse emission on the Galactic plane
in the R12 band, they account for only ∼ 18% of the
emission observed in the galactic plane in the R45 band.
