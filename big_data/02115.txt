In this work we investigate the two manganese pnictides BaMn2As2 and LaOMnAs, using fully
charge self-consistent density functional plus dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory calculations. These sys-
tems have a half-ﬁlled d-shell, and as a consequence, electronic correlations are strong, placing these
compounds at the verge of a metal-insulator transition. Although they have similar building blocks
in their crystal structure, our analysis shows that the two materials exhibit a very diﬀerent eﬀective
dimensionality, LaOMnAs being a quasi-two-dimensional material in contrast to the much more
three dimensional BaMn2As2. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed diﬀerences in the
N´eel temperature, the band gap, and the optical properties of the manganese compounds under
consideration can be traced back to exactly this eﬀective dimensionality. Our calculations show
excellent agreement with measured optical spectra.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Mott phenomenon, that is, the occurrence of an
insulating state without symmetry breaking, solely due
to electronic correlations, is among the most intensively
studied eﬀects in correlated solid state physics [1]. This
insulating state is not only interesting in its own right,
but also because it is the host for other fascinating phe-
nomena, the best-known example being high temperature
superconductivity in cuprate oxides. There,
injecting
charge carriers into this Mott insulating state by chemical
doping creates a non-Fermi-liquid state which becomes
superconducting at low temperatures [2].

In recent years another class of high-temperature su-
perconductors, the iron-based pnictide and chalcogenide
materials, has been identiﬁed [3].
In contrast to the
cuprates, they are intrinsically multi-band systems with
the whole 5d manifold being relevant for the electronic
properties [4; 5]. These iron-based materials share com-
mon building blocks, the iron-pnictogen or iron-chalcogen
layers, and the electronic conﬁguration of six electrons in
the ﬁve Fe-3d bands, which places them in the “Hund’s
metal” regime [6–8]. As a result of this band-ﬁlling, these
materials have very low coherence scales and sizable cor-
relations, without, however, being close to a Mott metal-
insulator transition.

Since superconductivity arises from quantum ﬂuctua-
tions in the normal state, we must understand the phys-
ical properties of the relevant parent compounds before
we can hope to understand superconductivity.

In this work we therefore investigate the two man-
ganese pnictide compounds BaMn2As2 and LaOMnAs,
which are isostructural to the iron-based superconduc-
tors BaFe2As2 and LaOFeAs, but host only ﬁve electrons
in the ﬁve Mn-3d bands. These systems can be seen
as the pnictide analogue of the undoped parent com-
pounds of the cuprate high-temperature superconduc-
tors [9; 10]. The half-ﬁlled Mn-3d shells of these com-

pounds promote Mott physics [11–13]. Eﬀorts to induce
metallicity by pressure [14] or doping [15–21] have been
to some extent successful. While no superconducting
state has been demonstrated conclusively [14], the man-
ganese pnictides still feature fascinating properties such
as giant magnetoresistance [22; 23], large Seebeck coef-
ﬁcients [24–27] and strongly enhanced magnetism with
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order persisting up to elevated
temperatures [23; 28].

In contrast to the related iron pnictides, both man-
ganese pnictides investigated here are semiconductors, as
shown in optical and conductivity measurements [11; 14;
17; 25–27; 29–31]. When considering an insulating state
in a half-ﬁlled system the question arises whether this
state occurs due to electronic correlations alone (Mott
mechanism), or because of symmetry breaking such as
magnetism (Slater mechanism). In many correlated ma-
terials both mechanisms are at work and sometimes of
similar importance. Furthermore,
it has been shown
that the proximity to a Mott transition can strongly in-
crease the magnetic ordering temperature [32]. For in-
stance, 1111 manganese pnictides including LaOMnAs
(TN ∼ 350 K [22; 24; 33]) and some 122 manganese pnic-
tides, like BaMn2P2 (TN > 750 K [34]) and BaMn2As2
(TN = 625 K [28]), remain ordered well above room tem-
perature. N´eel temperatures of this order naturally call
for a closer investigation of the underlying mechanisms.
We will show that LaOMnAs and BaMn2As2 are in-
deed close the a metal-insulator transition. However,
there are diﬀerences in the eﬀective dimensionality of
the two compounds, which will turn out to be decisive
for their properties. Speciﬁcally, BaMn2As2 crystallizes
in a ThCr2Si2-type structure and shows G-type AFM
(antiferromagnetic in all directions, see Fig. 1 right) and
a large magnetic moment of 3.9 µB/Mn [28]. Likewise,
LaOMnAs, with its ZrCuSiAs structure, features anti-
ferromagnetic Mn planes with a magnetic moment of
3.6 µB/Mn [23; 35], but the coupling between planes is

charge self-consistent calculations we use 10 000 k-points
in the full Brillouin zone (BZ) and employ the standard
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [49] generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation func-
tional.

From the DFT Bloch states we construct projective
Wannier functions for the Mn-3d orbitals in an energy
window from −5.00 eV to 3.40 eV for BaMn2As2. Like-
wise, we choose a window from −5.50 eV to 3.25 eV for
LaOMnAs. Using such a large energy window for the
projections, DMFT beneﬁts from a much better localiza-
tion of the Mn-3d Wannier functions [5; 45; 50], which
plays to the strengths of the DMFT approximation. In
DMFT we work with a full rotationally-invariant Slater
Hamiltonian for the ﬁve Mn-d orbitals with a Coulomb
interaction U = F 0 of 5.0 eV and a Hund’s coupling
J = (F 2 + F 4)/14 of 0.9 eV (F 4/F 2 = 0.625) and
the fully localized limit (FLL) double counting correc-
tion [51]. The TRIQS/CTHYB solver (v1.3) [52], which
is based on continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo in the
hybridization expansion [53; 54], is used to obtain the so-
lution of the impurity model on the Matsubara axis at
an inverse temperature β = 40 eV−1, corresponding to
room temperature. We use the stochastic maximum en-
tropy method [55] for the analytic continuation of the
self-energy to the real-frequency axis. We perform non-
spin-polarized DFT calculations also in the antiferromag-
netic case; thus the magnetic splitting of the Mn-3d spins
is purely introduced by DMFT. To describe the desired
antiferromagnetic state, the same self-energy is taken for
both Mn atoms in the unit cell, but with swapped spins.
We calculate the optical properties within the Kubo
formalism, neglecting vertex corrections (strongly sup-
pressed in DMFT [43; 56]), as implemented in the
TRIQS/DFTTools package [45]. For the optical calcu-
lations we increase the number of k-points to 150 000 for
BaMn2As2 and 100 000 for LaOMnAs in the full BZ. The
frequency-dependent optical conductivity is given by

ferromagnetic (C-type AFM, shown in Fig. 1 left). Al-
though both compounds share Mn-As layers with compa-
rable Mn-Mn distances, the diﬀerent layer stacking and
the larger Mn interlayer spacing turn LaOMnAs into
a quasi-two-dimensional compound [33; 36; 37], while
BaMn2As2 is much more three-dimensional [26; 38].

This paper is organized as follows. Sec. II is dedicated
to an outline of the methods and parameters we use. In
Sec. III, our results on the electronic structure, magnetic
and optical properties are presented and compared to ex-
perimental values where available. Finally, we conclude
in Sec. IV.

II. METHODS

DFT+DMFT [40], the combination of density func-
tional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory
(DMFT) [41–44], is used as theoretical framework for
the electronic structure calculations presented in this pa-
per. Unless otherwise stated, calculations were carried
out with the fully charge self-consistent implementation
of the TRIQS/DFTTools package (v1.3) [5; 45; 46], which
is based on Wien2k (v14.2) [47] and the TRIQS library
(v1.3) [48]. We use crystal structures measured at 300 K
for BaMn2As2 [28] and 290 K for LaOMnAs [22]. The
same crystal structure parameters are used for antiferro-
magnetic and paramagnetic calculations as no structural
phase transition accompanies the magnetic transition in
either compound [23; 28]. For the antiferromagnetic cal-
culations we use the experimentally determined magnetic
orderings (see Fig. 1), which are also predicted by total-
energy DFT calculations [26; 36]. Note that due to the
G-type ordering the magnetic unit cell is doubled in z-
direction in BaMn2As2. For the DFT part of the fully

III. RESULTS

A. Electronic Structure

In this section we present our DFT+DMFT results.
While we focus on the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase,
we also consider the paramagnetic (PM) solution to gain
insight into the origin of the insulating state (Mott or
Slater mechanism).

We start our discussion with the PM spectral functions
in Fig. 2 (top).
In DFT, the total non-spin-polarized
DFT spectral functions (light gray lines) in both com-
pounds are clearly metallic, in contrast to DFT+DMFT,
where the weight at the Fermi level is drastically reduced,
nearly opening a gap. The characteristic structure of
the correlated Mn-3d spectral function (shaded areas in
Fig. 2) is very similar in both compounds and consists
of a heavily smeared-out lower Hubbard band, which hy-
bridizes strongly with As-4p bands along its full width of
about 5.0 eV, and a sharply peaked upper Hubbard band
ranging from 0.0 to about 2.0 eV. The diﬀerences in the

total spectral function below −2.0 eV are explained by
the additional oxygen states present in LaOMnAs (not
explicitly shown here).

The strong electron-electron correlations in the half-
ﬁlled Mn-3d shells place both compounds at the verge
of the Mott metal-insulator transition. This condition is
also illustrated in the orbital-resolved PM spectral func-
tions of the Mn-3d shell (Fig. 3 top row). There, and in
the corresponding self-energies (not shown), we observe
orbital-selective behavior: While the x2−y2 orbital is still
unequivocally metallic, electronic correlations drive the
xz, yz and z2 orbitals close to the insulating phase. The
xy orbital is even more correlated, and already gapped
in LaOMnAs.
It has been shown that in comparison
to BaFe2As2 electronic correlations are much more eﬃ-
cient in BaMn2As2, placing the latter signiﬁcantly closer
to the Mott localization picture [13; 60]. Our paramag-
netic DFT+DMFT results conﬁrm this observation and
extend it to LaOMnAs, which is also more localized than
its itinerant Fe relative [5].

Seeing that for our interaction parameters, paramag-
netic LaOMnAs and BaMn2As2 are close to, but still on
the metallic side of, a Mott insulating phase, we per-
form additional calculations with increased interactions
of U = 6.0 eV and J = 1.0 eV. (Note that in half-ﬁlled
systems an increase of J leads to a decrease of the critical
coupling Uc [8].) However, this increase does not yield
an insulating solution and an even stronger interaction

Since both compounds share the structure of the
Mn-As layers (see Fig. 1), it is natural to ask why the
band gap of BaMn2As2 is narrower. The orbital-resolved
AFM DFT+DMFT spectral functions projected on the
Mn-3d states (Fig. 3 bottom) reveal that the gap is be-
tween the xy orbital on the occupied side and the z2 or-
bital on the unoccupied side in BaMn2As2. On the other
hand, the LaOMnAs gap is solely determined by the de-
generate xz and yz orbitals. Therefore, the determining
factor for the narrower gap can be attributed to the nar-
rowed and shifted spectral contribution of the xy and the
z2 orbitals.
Interestingly, the structural diﬀerence be-
tween the investigated compounds mainly impacts those
two orbitals, as we will see in the next section.

B. Maximally localized Wannier functions

To understand the inﬂuence of the structural diﬀer-
ences on the Mn-3d orbitals, and in further consequence
also on the physical properties, we construct an eﬀec-
tive real-space Hamiltonian for both compounds. For
the present section, we set aside the projective Wannier
functions we use in DFT+DMFT and construct ten max-
imally localized Wannier functions from the non-spin-
polarized Mn-3d bands. This model has the advantage
that it directly provides the eﬀective hopping between
Mn atoms, including all hopping paths over intermediate
atoms (Ba, La, As, O). Thus, it allows us to compare
the two compounds on the same footing. The maximally
localized Wannier functions for the Mn-3d orbitals are
shown in Fig. 5.

The matrix elements of the resulting eﬀective real-
space Hamiltonian as a function of distance are plotted in
Fig. 6. For each pair of Mn atoms all 25 matrix elements
between their ﬁve Mn-3d orbitals are shown. Considering
the in-plane hopping ﬁrst (circles), both materials are de-
scribed by a very similar Hamiltonian, which is expected
due to the shared structure of the Mn-As layers and the
comparable Mn-Mn distance within those layers. Turn-
ing to the interlayer hoppings (triangles), a completely
diﬀerent picture emerges. The Mn atoms in BaMn2As2
couple substantially to their respective neighbors on ad-
jacent planes, in contrast to LaOMnAs, where the inter-
layer coupling is on average more than 25 times lower and
not visible on the shown scale. From this it follows that
LaOMnAs is built up by quasi-two-dimensional Mn-As
layers coupled only very weakly to each other, whereas
BaMn2As2 shows much stronger interlayer coupling.

It bears mentioning that, in BaMn2As2, the interlayer
hoppings follow a diﬀerent decay than the in-plane hop-
pings with distance, visible in the much stronger coupling
for similar atomic distances. The responsible hoppings
for the interlayer coupling can be nearly exclusively at-
tributed to the xy and z2 orbitals, as the coupling of the
xz, yz orbitals is already below 0.05 eV. The x2 − y2
orbitals practically do not contribute to the interlayer
coupling. The largest hopping strength is found between

and antiferromagnetic (right) state of LaOMnAs. The thin

would not be realistic for Mn.

Conversely, the AFM spectral functions do feature
a gap (Fig. 2 bottom). DFT predicts small gaps of
0.1 eV for BaMn2As2 and 0.5 eV for LaOMnAs, consis-
tent with earlier theoretical results [17; 26; 29; 36].
In
DFT+DMFT, the gap remains similar in BaMn2As2 but
is somewhat enlarged in LaOMnAs, to about 0.6 eV. In
the case of BaMn2As2, the strong incoherence, the ﬁnite
temperature and the inﬂuence of the analytic continu-
ation prohibit the statement of an exact value for the
band gap. Nevertheless, the gap is clearly very narrow
in BaMn2As2 and of the same order as the DFT result.
Although the increase in the band gaps, due to the
is smaller than 0.1 eV, elec-
DFT+DMFT treatment,
tronic correlations lead to important diﬀerences in the
spectral functions: First, a strong renormalization of the
bandwidth of the unoccupied Mn states, and second, a
substantial smearing of the occupied Mn spectral weight
(see Figs. 2 and 4).

Experiments indicate that BaMn2As2 has, at least
at low temperatures, an indirect band gap of about
0.03 eV [14; 27; 30; 31]. To our knowledge, the only
experimental results for the LaOMnAs gap are 1.1 eV
from resistivity measurements of a polycrystalline sam-
ple at high temperatures [29] and 1.4 eV for LaOMnAs
thin ﬁlms, deduced from optical absorption spectra [25].
In both materials the fundamental gap is indirect,
and the smallest direct gap occurs at the Γ point. For
BaMn2As2, this direct gap is about 0.7 eV, close to the
recently published value of 0.8 eV [11]. For LaOMnAs, we
ﬁnd a direct gap of about 0.8 eV (see also Fig. 4). Un-
surprisingly, the AFM k-resolved spectral function and
the indirect/direct gaps of LaOMnAs agree well with
DFT+DMFT calculations for the closely related man-
ganese pnictide LaOMnP [61].

out-of-plane coupling indicates that the spatial distance
between the layers is not enough to fully explain the en-
hanced out-of-plane coupling. The second important dif-
ference is the stacking inversion of the Mn-As layers in
BaMn2As2.
In LaOMnAs the As atoms do not sit di-
rectly above each other as they do in BaMn2As2, where
the small As-As distance leads to a simple hopping path
via the As atoms. In the maximally localized Wannier
functions, this can be seen in the electronic weight of the
xy and z2 orbitals on the As atoms in the adjacent layer
(Fig. 5 magniﬁer symbol).

C. N´eel temperature

The highest N´eel temperature TN in a class of com-
pounds is usually found close to the Mott transition. This
was ﬁrst shown for the single-band Hubbard model on the
Bethe lattice [62] and the same argument was recently
found to be valid for the 4d perovskite SrTcO3 [32] with
its exceptionally high transition temperature of 1000 K.
When starting from an itinerant picture, for a model
with bandwidth W , where the interactions of order U
are treated on a mean-ﬁeld level, the transition temper-
ature scales as TN ∼ exp(−W/U ). On the fully localized
side, the adequate picture is the Heisenberg model, where
the scaling is TN ∼ W 2/U . Between these two extreme
cases we can expect a cross-over around U ≈ W , which
coincides with the cross-over from an itinerant to a local-
ized system. These qualitative considerations identify the
Mott transition as a hot-spot for magnetism, and hence,
materials in this critical region are prone to enhanced
transition temperatures.

From the paramagnetic DFT+DMFT spectral func-

ized Wannier orbitals for the Mn-3d shell of BaMn2As2 con-
structed with wien2wannier [58] and Wannier90 [59] and vi-
sualized in VESTA [39]. The xz orbital, which is not shown
here, is related to the yz orbital by crystal symmetry. The
thin lines connect the central Mn atoms to the four nearest
As atoms. The xy and z2 orbitals have signiﬁcant weight also
on the As atoms of the neighboring Mn-As layers. To em-
phasize this contribution, in the magniﬁer symbols we show
it enlarged both by applying a zoom and selecting a smaller
isovalue (by a factor of ten). By contrast, in LaOMnAs, no
weight would be seen on the adjacent Mn-As layers at these
isovalues.

the xy orbitals, followed by xy to z2 and z2 to z2.

The diﬀerence in the interlayer coupling of the Mn-As
layers can be traced back to multiple factors. First, the
distance between the Mn-As layers is much shorter in
BaMn2As2 (6.73 ˚A versus 9.04 ˚A), where they are sepa-
rated only by the rather narrow Ba layer in contrast to
the thicker La-O layer in LaOMnAs (see Fig. 1). The
fact that the in-plane coupling on distances comparable
to the layer distance is substantially smaller than the

hopping in z-direction (by a factor larger than 25), which
will be also reﬂected in an eﬀective J⊥. Band theoretical
estimates and experiments suggest that J⊥/J(cid:107) < 0.015
in LaOMnAs [36] and J⊥/J(cid:107) ≈ 0.1 in BaMn2As2 [38],
with J(cid:107) being the in-plane nearest neighbor exchange
coupling. This supports the conclusion that the reduced
N´eel temperature in LaOMnAs can be attributed to the
lower dimensionality of the system.

D. Optical Properties

Finally, we turn to the optical conductivity σαβ(Ω),
Eq. (1), which will not only exemplify the dimensional
diﬀerences of the investigated compounds, but also allow
a comparison with experimental observations.

Starting with BaMn2As2 (Fig. 8 red markers), we ob-
serve only a weak anisotropy in the optical conductiv-
ity. Besides the depression around Ω ≈ 2.5 eV, there is
not much of a diﬀerence between the in-plane and out-
of-plane contributions, even at small frequencies. This
reﬂects the more isotropic nature of BaMn2As2. A small
Drude peak is present in the in-plane component, which
is in accordance with the observation of a weak metallic
behavior at room temperature in Refs. 30 and 31. On the
contrary, there is no Drude peak in the out-of-plane com-
ponent, indicating that BaMn2As2 is insulating along the
z-direction, in agreement with the optical experiments of
Ref. 31. The optical conductivity of LaOMnAs (Fig. 8
blue markers) in x-direction shows a similar trend, but
is reduced by about 1/3 in comparison to BaMn2As2.
Since σzz(Ω) is strongly suppressed in LaOMnAs, the
total optical conductivity becomes largely dominated by
the in-plane contribution.

The similar in-plane conductivity of both compounds
originates from the common Mn-As layer structure,
though the eﬀect of the structural diﬀerences becomes
apparent in the distinct optical properties in z-direction.
We emphasize that the dimensional diﬀerence is also
visible in the DC conductivity (Ω → 0). The ratio
σxx(0)/σzz(0), which is an indicator for the anisotropy,
is 17 in LaOMnAs, but only 7 in BaMn2As2.

For LaOMnAs the optical conductivity was measured
using ellipsometry for a polycrystalline sample [29]. To
compare the experimental results to our calculations, we
average our theoretical results over all Cartesian direc-
tions to obtain a “polycrystalline conductivity” (Fig. 9).
In general, the DFT result (solid gray line) follows the
trend of the experimental data (black circles), but it
severely overestimates the optical conductivity, at some
points by more than a factor of two. Similarly, a one-
shot DFT+DMFT calculation (dashed blue line), where
DMFT is converged without updating the charge density,
cannot explain the experimental data. Here, the static
spin-splitting leads to a larger gap, which is clearly visible
in the suppressed optical conductivity below 1.5 eV. Ad-
ditionally, the unoccupied Mn states are less correlated
due to smaller electron-electron scattering as compared

tion, we have seen that BaMn2As2 and LaOMnAs
are close to a Mott transition, and their experimen-
tal N´eel temperatures are indeed high, with reports of
317 to 360 K in LaOMnAs [23; 33] and even 625 K in
BaMn2As2 [28]. In Fig. 7 we present our DFT+DMFT
results for the ordered moment as function of tempera-
ture. For BaMn2As2 we ﬁnd an ordering temperature
of around 1350 K. Taking into account the overestima-
tion of the transition temperature expected due to the
mean-ﬁeld character of DMFT [32], which is roughly a
factor of two [32; 63], the prediction of the N´eel temper-
ature in our calculation is in reasonable agreement with
the experimental value. Also, the ordered moment at low
temperatures agrees well with the experimental result of
3.9 µB/Mn [28].

The situation is diﬀerent for LaOMnAs. There, the
experimental ordering temperature is a factor of two
smaller than for BaMn2As2. However, the DFT+DMFT
result is smaller only by about 150 K. This observa-
tion is very similar to recent studies in technetium ox-
ides. In the cubic case (SrTcO3), the local DMFT ap-
proximation works well [32], but for the layered coun-
terpart Sr2TcO4 it overestimates the ordering temper-
ature substantially [64]. The reason is that in quasi-
two-dimensional systems, as is the case for Sr2TcO4 and
also for LaOMnAs, spatial ﬂuctuations become impor-
tant. They in turn decrease the ordering temperature
signiﬁcantly.
In the same way, DFT+DMFT yields a
saturated magnetic moment of 4.0 µB/Mn in contrast to
the measured 3.6 µB/Mn [23; 35].

From another point of view, it is well known that the
strength of the interlayer coupling is a crucial factor inﬂu-
encing the magnetic properties of layered materials [65],
for instance in the copper oxides [66; 67]. In such com-
pounds, the cross-over from a three-dimensional to a lay-
ered system leads to a suppression of the N´eel temper-
ature, as a function of the interlayer exchange coupling
J⊥. As we have observed above, the strong decrease of di-
mensionality in LaOMnAs manifests in a reduction of the

to full charge self-consistency. This results in a diﬀerent
distribution of the optical weight.

On the other hand, in the fully charge self-consistent
treatment, the optical results are not only inﬂuenced by
the modiﬁed spectral function, but also by the altered
velocities of the updated Kohn-Sham bands.
Indeed,
the fully charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations
correctly reproduce the experimental result over a wide
range of frequencies.

However, when only states within Wannier-function
projection window are used (blue dotted line),
DFT+DMFT misses spectral weight relative to experi-
ment above about 2.0 eV. Considering the chosen pro-
jective energy window and the chemical potential of the
correlated subspace, this is clearly due to transitions in-
cluding states outside of the projective energy window.
Therefore, we also calculate the optical conductivity in-
cluding those bands (solid blue line). To this end, we
extend the trace in Eq. (2); now, the spectral function is
a matrix built by a block Aij for the correlated bands,
as well as blocks for uncorrelated bands below and above
the correlated subspace, Aνν(cid:48). Note that Aνν(cid:48) ∝ δνν(cid:48)
is a non-interacting DFT spectral function. The result-
ing optical conductivity yields excellent agreement with
the experimental data up to 3.1 eV. The strong increase
above 3.1 eV is caused by the onset of the La-4f bands,
which are known to be placed much too low in energy by
DFT [51].

The remarkable agreement with experimental data un-
derlines the importance of the fully charge self-consistent
approach, and suggest that our choice of the parameters
U and J is appropriate. Furthermore, the experimen-
tal and theoretical results indicate that the direct band
gap of bulk LaOMnAs might be well below the 1.4 eV
obtained from thin-ﬁlm measurements [25].

shot DFT+DMFT (dashed blue line); compared to experi-
mental data (black circles) from Ref. 29. Above 3.1 eV both
DFT and DFT+DMFT (including the outer window) start
to deviate from the experimental data due to the onset of
the La-4f bands, which are placed much too low in energy by
DFT [51].

IV. CONCLUSION

We investigated the manganese pnictides BaMn2As2
and LaOMnAs in their paramagnetic and antiferromag-
netic phases. The comparison between these two man-
ganates provides a case study of dimensional cross-over:
While BaMn2As2 is quite isotropic with comparable cou-
plings within and between the Mn-As layers, LaOMnAs is
eﬀectively two-dimensional with only a weak residual in-
terlayer coupling. This diﬀerence, which is already visible
in the crystal structure, is substantiated, and its origins
are accounted for, by the maximally localized Wannier
functions for the Mn-3d bands and their hopping am-
plitudes. We demonstrated that diﬀerences in physical
properties such as the N´eel temperature, DC as well as
optical conductivity can be traced back to a large extent
to the diﬀerence in eﬀective dimensionality.

Our fully charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calcula-
tions yielded excellent agreement with the experimental
optical conductivity. Our conﬁdence in the applicability
of the method to our compounds thus conﬁrmed, we es-
tablished that both materials are on the verge of the Mott
metal-insulator transition, which helps explain their high
N´eel temperatures.

Our results constitute an important example where
charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT is demonstrably su-
perior to the one-shot approximation.
