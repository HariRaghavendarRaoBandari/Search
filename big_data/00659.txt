ABSTRACT
Open clusters (OCs) are crucial for studying the formation and evolution of the Galac-
tic disc. However, the lack of a large number of OCs analyzed homogeneously hampers
the investigations about chemical patterns and the existence of Galactocentric radial
and vertical gradients, or an age-metallicity relation. To overcome this, we have de-
signed the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey
(OCCASO). We aim to provide homogeneous radial velocities, physical parameters
and individual chemical abundances of six or more Red Clump stars for a sample of
25 old and intermediate-age OCs visible from the Northern hemisphere. To do so, we
use high resolution spectroscopic facilities (R (cid:62) 62, 000) available at Spanish observa-
tories. We present the motivation, design and current status of the survey, together
with the ﬁrst data release of radial velocities for 77 stars in 12 OCs, which repre-
sents about 50% of the survey. We include clusters never studied with high-resolution
spectroscopy before (NGC 1907, NGC 6991, NGC 7762), and clusters in common with
other large spectroscopic surveys like the Gaia-ESO Survey (NGC 6705) and APOGEE
(NGC 2682 and NGC 6819). We perform internal comparisons between instruments
to evaluate and correct internal systematics of the results, and compare our radial ve-
locities with previous determinations in the literature, when available. Finally, radial
velocities for each cluster are used to perform a preliminar kinematic study in relation
with the Galactic disc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Discs are the deﬁning stellar component of most of late-type
galaxies, including the Milky Way. They contain a substan-
tial fraction of the baryonic matter, angular momentum and
evolutionary activity of these galaxies, such as formation of
stars, spiral arms, or bars, and the various forms of secu-
lar evolution (see van der Kruit & Freeman 2011, for a re-
view). Understanding the formation and evolution of discs

is, therefore, one of the key goals of galaxy formation re-
search. Two complementary approaches are used to study
the growth and evolution of galactic discs over cosmic time.
The ﬁrst one consists in analyzing discs at diﬀerent red-
shifts (e.g. Wisnioski et al. 2015). Although these studies
are limited to global information integrated over the discs
stellar populations, they are able to trace the evolution of
discs properties with time. The second approach, so-called
galactic archaeology, consists on reconstructing the disc evo-
lution through resolving their stellar populations into indi-
vidual stars (e.g. Carrera et al. 2011). The disc evolution is

2

Casamiquela et al.

fossilized in the orbital distribution of stars, their chemical
composition and ages as a function of position: i.e. in form
of radial and vertical gradients. Part of this information may
be diluted through dynamical evolution and radial mixing
in the disc, which is less severe for clusters than for ﬁeld
stars. Therefore, the clusters are more suitable targets for
discs studies.

The disc of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, oﬀers an
excellent testbed for investigating its evolution using all the
power of the galactic archaeology approach. In spite of the
great observational eﬀort performed to unveil the details of
the disc structure, these are still unknown. The vertical den-
sity proﬁle has been characterized as a sum of two expo-
nential components, the so-called thin and thick discs (e.g.
Yoshii 1982; Gilmore & Reid 1983). Recent studies have fo-
cused on dissecting the disc into subsets of stars of very
similar chemical composition, also called mono-abundance
populations (e.g. Ivezi´c et al. 2008). These studies found that
in the solar neighborhood the vertical structure is composed
of a smooth continuum of disc thicknesses (e.g. Bovy et al.
2012). However, the stellar disc population shows a clear bi-
modal distribution in ([Fe/H],[α/Fe]) with two sequences of
high- and low-[α/Fe] (Adibekyan et al. 2012; Nidever et al.
2014). The high-[α/Fe] is more prominent in the inner disc,
while the low-[α/Fe], and in particular its metal-poor end,
dominates in the outer disc. Eggen et al. (1962) suggested
the possibility that the stellar disc formed “upside-down” in
the sense that old stars were formed in a relatively thick
component, or are kinematically heated very quickly after
their birth, while younger populations form in successively
thinner discs. It has been thought for a long time that the
vertical distribution of the disc is the result of some type
of heating either due to satellite mergers (e.g. Abadi et al.
2003) or radial migration (e.g. Sellwood & Binney 2002).
However, late results (e.g. Bird et al. 2013) point to an sce-
nario similar to the early suggestion by Eggen et al. (1962).
The radial structure of the Galactic disc has been in-
vestigated using diﬀerent tracers trying to cover as much
Galactocentric distances as possible. Some of these tracers
are H ii regions (e.g. Balser et al. 2011), B-type stars (e.g.
Daﬂon et al. 2009), Cepheid variables (e.g. Lemasle et al.
2013; Andrievsky et al. 2013; Korotin et al. 2014; Genovali
et al. 2015), planetary nebulae (e.g. Stanghellini & Haywood
2010), or open clusters (OCs, see below) and also main se-
quence (e.g. Nordstr¨om et al. 2004; Cheng et al. 2012; Miko-
laitis et al. 2014) or giant ﬁeld populations (e.g. Hayden et al.
2014; Huang et al. 2015). Although all of them agree on the
existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the sense that
stellar populations are richer towards the inner disk, there
are discrepancies about how this gradient behaves. While the
radial gradient described by OCs ﬂattens at large Galacto-
centric distances (e.g. Carrera & Pancino 2011; Frinchaboy
2013), the Cepheids do not show a slope change in the outer
disc (e.g. Lemasle et al. 2013). These discrepancies can be
partially explained by the fact that each tracer is represen-
tative of stellar populations of diﬀerent age. Until the recent
arrival of large Galactic surveys, most of the studies were
limited by the small sample size. The current large surveys
are also hampered by the lack of accurate distances. This
issue will be improved signiﬁcantly in the near future by the
advent of Gaia space mission data (see Sec. 1.1).

In comparison with other tracers, some of the OCs prop-

erties, such as distances or ages, can be accurately deter-
mined (see Friel 1995, for a review). In fact, most stars, in-
cluding the Sun, are formed in stellar clusters although most
of them are dissolved in the ﬁrst few Myr (e.g. Portegies
Zwart et al. 2010). Those that survive are the more massive
OCs or those that have had less encounters, which contain
the fossil record of the disc formation. Moreover, OCs cover
a wide range of age that allows also to study the evolution
of the disc with time (e.g. Carrera & Pancino 2011; Frinch-
aboy 2013). The number of clusters old enough ((cid:38) 250 Myr)
for such a study will be increased with Gaia observations
making this kind of studies even more promising.

For all these reasons, OCs have been used for a long
time to investigate the Galactic disc, starting from the pio-
neering studies by Janes (1979); Panagia & Tosi (1980). A
review of the early Galactic disc studies using OCs as trac-
ers can be found in Friel (1995). A great observational ef-
fort has been performed to characterize OCs homogeneously
(e.g. Friel et al. 2002a, 2010; Sestito et al. 2008; Donati et al.
2015; Bragaglia & Tosi 2006) and/or to increase the observed
samples (e.g. Twarog et al. 1997; Carrera & Pancino 2011;
Jacobson et al. 2011a,b). All these investigations agree on
the fact that the iron content decreases with increasing ra-
dius as has been found using other tracers (e.g. Lemasle
et al. 2013). Most of the previously cited works were limited
to the inner 15 kpc. However, investigations based on sam-
ples containing clusters at larger Galactocentric distances
(e.g. Carrera & Pancino 2011; Yong et al. 2012; Frinchaboy
2013) found that the gradient appears to ﬂatten from a ra-
dius of about 12 kpc, which is near the dynamical signature
for Galactic co-rotation (L´epine et al. 2011). Moreover, it
seems that the metallicity gradient observed in the inner
disc was steeper in the past and has ﬂattened with time
(Carrera & Pancino 2011; Jacobson et al. 2011b; Yong et al.
2012; Frinchaboy 2013), as it is seen in M 33 (Beasley et al.
2015). No signiﬁcant trends with radius have been observed
in the abundances of other chemical species (e.g. Yong et al.
2012).

1.1 OCCASO in the context of large surveys

Our understanding of the Milky Way in general and the
Galactic disc in particular is going to change signiﬁcantly
in the next years with the Gaia space mission (Perryman
et al. 2001; Mignard 2005; Lindegren 2005). Gaia is a full-
sky scanning satellite observing all stars down to 20th magni-
tude with precisions at the µas level. Parallaxes and proper
motions of individual stars will be as precise as 1% for the
OCs up to a distance of 1.5 kpc, and 10% for almost all
known clusters. Importantly, the faint limiting magnitude
and the high precision will allow the discovery of distant
clusters. However, spectroscopic capabilities to derive chem-
ical abundances are limited due to the low resolution and
the small wavelength coverage of the Gaia RVS.

On the other hand, the Kepler space mission and its
extension K2 is providing asteroseismic data with unprece-
dented detail, which will allow to quantify global properties
of stars such as age, mass and radii to accuracies near 1%
(Gilliland et al. 2010). It is targeting solar-like stars, red
giants, classical pulsating stars, and oscillating stars in bi-
naries and clusters. The advantages of asteroseismology for
clusters are that, unlike estimates of colors and magnitudes,

seismic data do not suﬀer from uncertainties in distance
or extinction and reddening. Asteroseismic observations of
many stars allow testing stellar evolution theory and provide
important constraints on the ages and chemical composi-
tions of stars. K2 data (Howell et al. 2014) is particularly
interesting because it covers a wider area and more clusters
than the original Kepler ﬁeld.

The Gaia and Kepler space observations are being com-
plemented with several ongoing and forthcoming ground-
based spectroscopic surveys. Low- and medium-resolution
spectroscopic surveys (R < 10, 000), such as the RA-
dial Velocity Experiment (RAVE; Conrad et al. 2014), the
Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Explo-
ration (SEGUE; Lee et al. 2008), and Large Sky Area Multi-
Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST; Li et al.
2015) survey, provide radial velocities, together with rough
information about the chemical content of the studied stars.
Large high-resolution spectroscopic surveys (R (cid:38) 20, 000)
such as the ongoing Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Frinchaboy 2013), the
Gaia-ESO Survey (GES; Gilmore et al. 2012; Randich et al.
2013), the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH;
De Silva et al. 2015) and the forthcoming WEAVE (Dalton
et al. 2012) provide detailed information about the chemical
composition, in addition to radial velocities.

However, most of the large high-resolution spectroscopic
surveys do not have dedicated observations of OCs. Except
for a few systems observed for calibration purposes, OCs
stars are targeted only when they fall in the ﬁeld of view
of other targets. This means that the results for most of
the studied clusters are based on observations of one or two
members only. Currently, APOGEE is the only survey sam-
pling the Northern hemisphere. GES and GALAH are oper-
ating in the South, and WEAVE has not yet deﬁned the ob-
servations of OCs and will not start operations until at least
2017. APOGEE is obtaining high-resolution (R ∼ 22, 500)
spectra in the infrared H-band, which allows to sample the
innermost regions of the Galaxy. However, it is sampling
OC stars at any evolutionary stage and it is not observing a
minimum of stars in each cluster. In fact, six or more cluster
members have been analyzed only in 7 of the OCs observed
for calibration purposes. This makes detailed studies of the
Milky Way OCs using APOGEE data diﬃcult.

There are other long-term projects dedicated to the
study of the OCs. The Bologna Open Cluster Chemical Evo-
lution project (Bragaglia & Tosi 2006, BOCCE) uses both
color-magnitude diagram synthesis and high-resolution spec-
tra to infer cluster properties such as age, distance, and
chemical composition. The WIYN Open cluster study (von
Hippel & Sarajedini 1998, WOCS) is also obtaining pho-
tometry, astrometric and spectroscopic data for few nearby
OCs. However, these surveys have been designed to study
each cluster individually and not to provide a sample of OCs
to constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc.

Therefore, GES is the only large survey that has a pro-
gram particularly designed to study the existence of trends
in the Galactic disc. GES is designed to use the FLAMES
capabilities (GIRAFFE+UVES; Pasquini et al. 2002) at the
second VLT unit in order to complement the Gaia mission.
GES clusters observations include 20-25 OCs older than 0.5
Gyr. For them, GES is using the GIRAFFE ﬁbers to de-
rive radial velocities and chemical abundances in stars at

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2016)

any evolutionary stage brighter than V ∼ 19 with a resolu-
tion R ∼ 20, 000. The six UVES ﬁbers, which cover a wave-
length range between 4800 and 7000 ˚Awith a resolution of
47,000, are being used to measure accurate radial velocities
and detailed chemical abundances for the brightest targets,
mostly Red Clump (RC) stars. The UVES observations of
old OCs have been designed to obtain a homogeneous sam-
ple of chemical abundances to study the Galactic disc. Using
stars in the same evolutionary stage avoids the blurring of
the trends due to chemical inhomogenities produced by stel-
lar nucleosynthesis itself, and ensures the homogeneity of
the sample.

such as

Several key OCs

the most metal-rich,
NGC 6791, and the oldest, Berkeley 17, together with several
systems towards the Galactic anticenter or those observed
by the Kepler mission are only visible from the North, thus
will not be observed by GES.

The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances from Spanish
Observatories (OCCASO) survey has been designed to
overcome many of the above caveats. It will obtain accurate
radial velocities and chemical abundances for more than 20
chemical species from high-resolution spectra (R (cid:62) 62, 000)
in Northern OCs using the facilities available at Spanish
observatories. As such, it is a natural complement to the
GES observations from the South and the Gaia mission
from space. The goal of this paper is to present the survey,
its observations, data reduction, and analysis strategies. We
also give a detailed analysis of the radial velocities for the
ﬁrst batch of observations.

The general survey strategy is described in Sec. 2. More
in detail: science drivers of the survey (Sec. 2.1) criteria
used to select the cluster sample (Sec. 2.2), observational
facilities used (Sec. 2.3), observational strategy (Sec. 2.4),
and data reduction procedure (2.5). The ﬁrst data release
is described in Sec. 3, which includes the description of
the observational material (Sec. 3.1), the accuracy on the
wavelength calibration (Sec. 3.2), and the results on the
radial velocities (Sec. 3.3). Finally, an external comparison
of the stars in common with previous works is done in
Sec. 3.4, and a discussion of the results based on the
kinematics of the disc and spiral arms are presented in
Sec. 3.5. A summary is provided in Sec. 4.

2 THE OCCASO SURVEY

2.1 OCCASO science drivers

As discussed in the previous section, the main OCCASO
science driver is the study of the chemical evolution of
the Galactic disc. Therefore, the observations and analysis
strategies have been optimized for this purpose. However,
the OCCASO observational data and results can contribute
to our understanding of other astrophysical questions. Here
we summarize some of these additional science topics that
can be addressed with OCCASO.

• Galactic disc kinematics. The same reasons that make
OCs good chemical tracers of the Galactic disc justify their
use as tracers to investigate the Galaxy dynamics. The ro-
tation curve described by OCs is similar to that derived

4

Casamiquela et al.

from other thin disc populations such as Cepheids, H ii re-
gions or molecular clouds (e.g. Hron 1987; Scott et al. 1995;
Glushkova et al. 1998; Friel et al. 2002b). It seems that the
rotational velocity gradually decreases with age. This is ac-
companied by a smooth increase of the line-of-sigh velocity
dispersion (Hayes & Friel 2014). However, there are several
OCs with unusual kinematics that keep them away from
the disc or the inner regions of the Galaxy. It has been sug-
gested that several OCs in the outer disc could have been ac-
creted during a dwarf galaxy merger. In this sense, two OCs
Saurer 1 and Berkeley 29 have been related to the Galactic
anticenter stellar structure, also known as Monoceros stream
(Frinchaboy et al. 2006). An extragalactic origin has also
been proposed for the most metal-rich known OC, NGC 6791
(Carraro et al. 2006). However, accurate proper motions de-
rived from Hubble Space Telescope data suggest that this
cluster was formed near the Galactic bulge (Bedin et al.
2006). In addition to the chemical abundances OCCASO
will provide radial velocities for observed stars with uncer-
−1 (see Sec. 3.3). These radial
tainties of about 0.5 km s
velocities together with the proper motions provided by the
Gaia mission will allow us to study the three-dimensional
kinematics of the OCs, trace their orbits and relate them to
the spiral structure of the Galactic disc.

• Stellar evolution laboratories. OCs have been widely
used to check the applicability of stellar evolutionary models
and the validity of their physical parameters and prescrip-
tions such as convective overshooting (e.g. Pietrinferni et al.
2004), and rotation (e.g. Carlberg 2014; Lanzafame & Spada
2015). In spite of the progress performed in last years, cur-
rent evolutionary models are not able to completely repro-
duce the colour-magnitude diagrams of many OCs indepen-
dently of their metallicities (e.g. Ahumada et al. 2013). A
possible explanation could be that each cluster has diﬀerent
abundance ratios (Gallart et al. 2005). Stellar evolutionary
models for diﬀerent chemical compositions besides the iron
and α-elements have not been available until very recently
(e.g. VandenBerg et al. 2012). The chemical abundances pro-
vided by OCCASO will help to constrain the parameters of
such.

OCCASO could also contribute in the understanding of
a variety of topics such as the study of the internal dynam-
ics of old (highly evolved) OCs (e.g. Bonatto & Bica 2003;
Davenport & Sandquist 2010), and the detection of signs of
the existence of multiple stellar populations (Geisler et al.
2012; Carrera 2012b; Cunha et al. 2015). However, the small
number of stars sampled in each cluster diﬁcults these kind
of studies from OCCASO data only.

2.2 Clusters and stars selection

We select OCs to observe in OCCASO according to the fol-
lowing criteria:

(i) Visible from the Northern hemisphere
(ii) Ages (cid:38) 0.3 Gyr, since intermediate-age and old
OCs are excellent probes of the structure and chemo-
dynamical evolution of the Galactic disc.

(iii) With six or more stars in the expected position of the

RC area of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)1. In
general, RC stars are clearly identiﬁed even in sparsely
populated CMDs. In some cases, however, it is not easy
to diﬀerenciate a RC star from a Red Giant Branch
(RGB) star in OCs, so for simplicity we refer them as
RC from now on. Selecting RGB stars instead of RC
would not imply abundance changes except maybe for
light elements, e.g C or N. Spectra from these kind
of stars are less line-crowded and therefore, easier to
analyze than those of the brighter giants. Moreover,
targeting objects in the same evolutionary state avoids
measuring distinct abundances for some elements due
to eﬀects of stellar evolution. The requirement of six
stars has been chosen to have reasonable statistics for
the chemical abundances of each cluster.

strained by the available instruments/telescopes.

(iv) With RC magnitude brighter than V ∼ 15 mag, con-
(v) Prioritizing those with ages, metallicities, heights
from the plane, or Galactocentric distances lying in
poorly studied regions of the RGC-[Fe/H], Age-[Fe/H],
z-[Fe/H] diagrams. In this way, we will improve the
sampling homogenity of the Galactic disc.

(vi) Some clusters with previous high-resolution studies
in the literature (e.g. Carrera & Pancino 2011; Car-
rera 2012a; Bragaglia & Tosi 2006), and OCs selected
in other surveys (GES, APOGEE) for comparison pur-
poses.

Following the outlined criteria, we selected a list of 25
candidate OCs, distributed in the RGC-[Fe/H], Age-[Fe/H],
z-[Fe/H] diagrams as seen in Fig. 1. This paper focuses on
the ﬁrst 12 OCs for which observations were completed by
January 2015. Some basic properties of these clusters are
listed in Table 1, and they are represented as red squares in
Fig. 1.

To select individual stars within each cluster we use the
available literature information, with the following proce-
dure:

(a) the targets are ﬁrst selected among the stars located in
the expected position of the RC in the CMD from the
available photometries (see Fig. 2);

(b) membership information based on radial velocities and
proper motions, if available, is taken into account (see
Table 6);

(c) stars already ﬂagged as non-members or spectroscopic

binaries are avoided.

In some cases where membership information is not
available (poor photometry, no prior information about ra-
dial velocities or proper motions), we acquire complementary
medium-resolution spectroscopy. The strategy is to obtain
radial velocities and overall metallicities for a large selection
of objects in the line of sight of the cluster, to constrain the
selection of members (see Carrera et al. 2015, for further
details).

1 Actually, some bright clusters not fullﬁlling this condition were
added to be observed during nights of non optimal weather con-
ditions.

CAFE is installed in a temperature and vibration controlled
room. It oﬀers a maximum resolution of R ∼ 62, 000, and a
spectral coverage of 3900 − 9500 ˚A.
Since only one star can be observed at once in each
of the spectrographs, we distribute our observations among
the three diﬀerent telescopes/instruments according to the
magnitude of the stars. This allows us to develop OC-
CASO on a timeline similar to GES. The brightest tar-
gets (V (cid:54) 13) are assigned to HERMES@Mercator, and the
faintest stars (V > 13) are assigned mainly to FIES@NOT
and CAFE@2.2m CAHA. Current eﬃciency of CAFE is
lower than expected and all the faint stars were ﬁnally moved
to FIES.

2.4 Observational strategy

All stars are observed in at least 3 exposures lasting 80-
3600 s, depending on their magnitude, until a global signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 70 per pixel at λ ∼ 6000 ˚A

within OCCASO. Red squares are the 12 OCs released in this
paper. Solid lines in the middle panel show the linear ﬁt for OCs
inwards and outwards of RGC = 12.5 kpc.

2.3 Observational facilities

There is no easy access for the European community to
a spectrograph with similar multi-object capabilities as
UVES, in the Northern hemisphere. However, at Spanish
Observatories there are several echelle high-resolution spec-
trographs available with resolutions and wavelength cover-
age ranges similar to, or larger than UVES. In particular, for
OCCASO we have selected: CAFE at the 2.2m telescope in
the Centro Astron´omico Hispano-Alem´an (CAHA), FIES at
the 2.5m NOT telescope in the Observatorio del Roque de
los Muchachos (ORM), and HERMES at the 1.2m Mercator
telescope also in the ORM. See Table 2 for a summary of
the instrument characteristics.

The high-resolution Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph
(FIES; Telting et al. 2014) is a cross-dispersed echelle spec-
trograph mounted at the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope
(NOT), and located in the ORM in the island of La Palma
(Spain). FIES is mounted in a heavily isolated building
separated from the NOT building. It is connected to the
Cassegrain focus of the telescope with a ﬁber bundle oﬀer-

is reached. For the faintest targets (V (cid:62) 14), this condition
is relaxed to a SNR ∼ 50. Each run we take a sky expo-
sure to subtract the sky emission lines and, when relevant,
the sky background level (see Sec 2.5). Hot, rapidly rotating
stars were observed twice per run to remove sky absorp-
tion features, like telluric bands of O2 and H2O. Standard
calibration images (ﬂat, bias and arcs) were also taken at
the beginning and end of each night. In general we assign
each cluster to one instrument to maximize the precision in
our measurements. In order to guarantee the homogeneity
of our whole sample, at the beginning of the survey we have
repeated observations of a set of few stars with the three in-
struments. Additionally, Arcturus (α-Bootes) and µ-Leonis,
two extensively studied stars, part of the Gaia Benchmark
stars (Jofr´e et al. 2014; Blanco-Cuaresma et al. 2014; Heiter
et al. 2015) and the APOGEE reference stars (Smith et al.

2013), were observed with the three telescopes for the sake
of comparison. We distribute the target stars among the
observing runs (see Sec 3.1) taking into account their mag-
nitudes, the quality of the nights and the characteristics of
the instruments.

2.5 Data reduction

The ﬁrst part of the data reduction consists in bias sub-
traction, ﬂat-ﬁeld normalization, order tracing and extrac-
tion, wavelength calibration and order merge. This step is
performed with the dedicated pipelines for each instrument:
HERMESDRS for HERMES@Mercator (Raskin et al. 2011),
FIESTool for FIES@NOT (Telting et al. 2014), and the
pipeline developed by J. Ma´ız-Apell´aniz for CAFE@2.2m
CAHA, and used in Negueruela et al. (2014). We have
checked that the results from the pipelines are appropri-
ate: the spectra are correctly extracted, calibration in λ is
realistic and the merging of the orders does not introduce
artefacts and defects in the regions were orders overlap. The
useful range from CAFE spectra is taken as 4500−9000 ˚A to
avoid saturated telluric lines and other instrumental defects
at the red and blue edges. We take the whole wavelength
ranges for HERMES and FIES.

After these initial steps of reduction, the spectra from

the three instruments are handled in the same way. The
established reduction protocol consists in:

(i) Subtraction of sky emission lines using sky exposures.
It was only applied to those cases where the levels of
the sky lines were higher than 3% of the continuum, to
avoid adding noise to the spectra.

(ii) Normalization by ﬁtting the continuum with a poly-
nomial function and radial velocity determination of
the individual spectra using DAOSPEC (Stetson &
Pancino 2008) (see details in Sec. 3.3).

(iii) Correction of telluric features using the IRAF2 task
telluric. To do so we acquire one or two exposures of
a hot, rapidly rotating star (among HR551, HR7235,
HR2198, HR8762 or HR3982, taking into account visi-
bility) in each run. The strong O2 band around 7600 ˚A
in HERMES and CAFE spectra is saturated and can-
not be removed properly.

(iv) Heliocentric correction to account for observer’s mo-

tion is obtained with the IRAF task rvcorrect.

(v) The accuracy of the wavelength calibration is tested
through the measurement of the radial velocity of sky
emission lines. For each run, we measure the radial
velocities of the skylines: 6300.304, 6363.78, 6863.95,
7276.405, 7913.708, 8344.602, and 8827.096 ˚A when
visible, in all sky exposures and/or in target star expo-
sures before applying the heliocentric correction. The
obtained oﬀset, if any, is used to correct the individual
exposures with the IRAF task dopcor (see Sec. 3.2).

(vi) Combination of the single normalized spectra of the
same star and telescope. We use the IRAF task scom-
bine with a median algorithm and a sigma-clipping re-
jection. This aims to reach the maximum SNR for ﬁnal
radial velocity determination and further abundance
analysis.

(vii) Final radial velocity determination and normalization

of the combined spectra using DAOSPEC.

As an example of the results of the reduction proto-
col, we show three regions of the combined and normalized
spectrum of the star NGC 2682 W141 in Fig. 3.

VELOCITIES

In this section we present the radial velocities obtained from
the reduced spectra acquired until January 2015 for the com-
pleted clusters.

3.1 Observational material

OCCASO observations started in January 2013. Until Jan-
uary 2015, we have completed a total of 53 nights of obser-
vations. The number of nights, dates and instrument of each
run are summarized in Table 3 together with the percentage
of time lost due to bad weather, and a description of the
quality of the sky.

2 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Obser-
vatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for
Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation.

3.2 Wavelength calibration accuracy

The wavelength calibration accuracy is key for the radial ve-
locity determination. To re-assess it, we calculate the radial
velocity oﬀsets of sky emission lines as described in Sec. 2.5.
The mean values and standard deviations of the radial ve-
locity oﬀsets are listed in Table 4. We can conclude that:

(i) All FIES runs have negligible oﬀset except for run#1,
−1. The
for which it has a value of 5.09 ± 0.44 km s
pipeline could not be run in the telescope during the
observing run, and it was run a posteriori using a ver-
sion built to be used outside the NOT. The origin of
the oﬀset could be related to the use of inappropriate
calibration images when running the pipeline. We have
corrected the individual spectra of this run using this
value.

(ii) All HERMES oﬀsets are compatible with 0 km s

−1
within the errors. The mean value is −0.28 ±
−1. This oﬀset can be neglected given the
0.11 km s
spectral resolution of the instrument.

(iii) Both runs from CAFE present a roughly constant oﬀ-
set of unknown origin, with a mean value and standard
−1. We have shifted all the
deviation of 2.55± 0.62 km s
spectra from these runs by −2.55 km s

−1.

3.3 Radial velocities

We present here the results of the radial velocities for stars
in the 12 completed clusters (77 stars), and the reference
stars Arcturus and µ-Leo. This is a total of 79 stars from
which 17 have repeated observations with more than one
telescope: 25 were observed with FIES@NOT, 66 were ob-
served with HERMES@Mercator, and 11 were observed with
CAFE@2.2m CAHA.

All radial velocities are measured using DAOSPEC
(Stetson & Pancino 2008). DAOSPEC is a Fortran code that
ﬁnds absorption lines in a stellar spectrum, ﬁts the contin-
uum, identiﬁes lines from a provided linelist, and measures
equivalent widths. DAOSPEC also provides radial velocity
estimates using a cross-correlation procedure based on the
line centers and on their reference laboratory wavelength in

the linelist (i.e., a sort of line mask cross-correlation). To run
DAOSPEC we used the DOOp code (Cantat-Gaudin et al.
2014a), an algorithm that optimizes its most critical param-
eters in order to obtain the best measurements of equivalent
widths (EW). In brief, it ﬁne tunes the FWHM and the con-
tinuum placement among other parameters, through a fully
automatic and iterative procedure.

We built our linelist starting from the public GES
linelist version 3, which contains 47098 lines. However, this
linelist goes from 4700 < λ < 6800 ˚A and our covered spec-
tral range is much wider. Therefore, we extended our linelist
redder than 6800 ˚A using the linelist described in Pancino
et al. (2010). The ﬁnal linelist has 1400 lines, from which
∼1000 (after a sigma clipping rejection criteria) are used
for the radial velocities. Further details will be provided in
Casamiquela et al. (in preparation), where we will release
the linelist together with the physical parameters and indi-
vidual abundance determinations from OCCASO.

We compute radial velocities from both individual and
combined exposures for each star, as mentioned in Sec. 2.5.
Using the combined exposures, we perform a comparison
among the three instruments, and we compute the ﬁnal val-
ues per star. We perform a membership selection after which
we compute the average radial velocity for each of the 12
clusters. Details are given in the following subsections.

3.3.1 Individual exposures

We measure radial velocities from individual exposures af-
ter rectifying the oﬀsets calculated in Sec. 3.2, and once
heliocentric corrections are applied. The values obtained are
listed in Table 5. The ﬁrst, second and third columns denote
the star identiﬁer (taken from WEBDA3), night of observa-
tion, and instrument, respectively; the fourth column indi-
cates the Heliocentric Julian Date (HJD) of the observation;
and the ﬁfth column lists the measured radial velocity and
the uncertainty. The quoted uncertainties are those calcu-
lated by DAOSPEC, which correspond to the line-by-line
radial velocity variance.

The uncertainties on the individual radial velocities are
constrained by the resolution and wavelength range (which
limits the number of lines used) of the instrument, and the
SNR of the spectrum. The distribution of uncertainties is
−1 for
shown in Fig. 4, with median values of 0.6 ± 0.1 km s
−1
−1 for HERMES, and 1.2 ± 0.3 km s
FIES, 0.8 ± 0.4 km s
for CAFE.

Although our observations are not designed to look for
spectroscopic binaries4, we can detect them by comparing
the radial velocity obtained from diﬀerent exposures of the
same star. Individual radial velocities for all stars agree
within the errors but one, NGC 6819 W983, with a radial
−1 from the exposure in the night
velocity of 3.2 ± 0.8 km s
−1 from the three consec-
25 Jul 2013, and −8.3 ± 0.8 km s
utive exposures in the night 29 Jul 2013. We ﬂag this star
as possible spectroscopic binary, (see Sec. 3.3.3 for further
discussions).

There can be other single-line spectroscopic binaries
within our sample that we are not detecting because in most

3.3.3 Final values from combined spectra

The ﬁnal values of the radial velocity for each star are de-
rived from the combined spectra. For the cases of stars ob-
served with several instruments we adopt the weighted mean
of all the determinations, and the mean of the nominal errors
as the uncertainty. These ﬁnal values are found in column
12 of Table 6.

In general, stars have compatible radial velocities within
the same cluster. This is because they were already pre-
selected to be very likely cluster members, as explained
in Sec. 2.2. However, a re-analysis of membership is per-
formed. We ﬂag as non-members those stars which have vr
not compatible at 3σ level of the radial velocity of the clus-
ter. We have used the median and the mean absolute devia-
tion (M AD). We iterate this by rejecting the non-members
and recalculating the median radial velocity, until we ﬁnd a
sample of compatible stars. Under this criterium we ﬂag the
following ﬁve stars:

(i) NGC 1907 W2087 has a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of ∼
−1 with respect to the other stars from the same
60 km s
cluster. The four values from individual exposures of
this star (see Table 5) are compatible with each other,
so probably it is a non-member star or a large period
spectroscopic binary. There is no other measurement
in the literature for comparison.

−1, which is 5.4 km s

(ii) NGC 2539 W233 has a radial velocity of 34.8 ±
−1 above the median of
1.1 km s
the other ﬁve stars. It was already ﬂagged as spectro-
scopic binary by Mermilliod et al. (2008). They obtain
−1.
a variability with the maximum at 28.3±1.1 km s
This value is compatible with ours within 3σ.
−1 un-
der the median of the cluster. The four individual spec-
tra were taken in two consecutive days and the individ-
ual radial velocities are in agreement. It was already
ﬂagged as member spectroscopic binary by Jacobson
et al. (2011b) and Geller et al. (2015).

(iii) NGC 2682 W224 has a radial velocity 6.5 km s

(iv) NGC 6819 W983 has a variable radial velocity as
shown in Table 5 and discussed in Sec. 3.3.1. For this
reason we do not give a ﬁnal value of the radial velocity,
and we do not include it in Table 6. Neither Hole et al.
(2009) nor Milliman et al. (2014) identify this star as
a radial velocity variable, obtaining a ﬁnal radial ve-
−1. Both studies are based
locity of 2.36 ± 0.20 km s
in the same spectra (6 observations) and classify this
star as single sember for having e/i<4 (external error
divided by internal error). If this star was conﬁrmed
to be a cluster binary member, we could consider it in
the abundance analysis of the cluster.

(v) NGC 7762 W0084 has a large diﬀerence of
−1 with respect to the other stars from the
∼ 40 km s
same cluster. Radial velocities obtained from the three
individual spectra acquired in two consecutive nights
are consistent within the uncertainties. There are nei-
ther previous radial velocity measurements nor infor-
mation on membership for this cluster.

Special attention must be payed to NGC 7789. Follow-
ing the iterative procedure described above, two stars should
be rejected: W08260 and W07714. Radial velocities of all
stars in this OC compare well with the literature for stars

in common (Gim et al. 1998; Jacobson et al. 2011b, see Ta-
ble 6), which considers all of them as members. Moreover,
Jacobson et al. (2011b) reported that they ﬁnd a broader
dispersion compared with other OCs. Taking into account
the OC mean radial velocity and dispersion from the three
large samples in the literature (Table 7), all the seven stars
studied here fall inside the distribution. Therefore, we have
decided to keep these two stars as members.

The rest of studied stars from the observed clusters are
compatible with being members of their parent cluster. We
point out that stars NGC 1907 W0133, NGC 6819 W978,
and NGC 7762 W0003, have radial velocities outside of the
3M AD margin of the cluster, but when also considering the
uncertainties on these radial velocities, these stars are still
within the cluster distributions, and are included as mem-
bers in our sample (see Fig. 6). The doubtful cases of mem-
bership will be probably solved when doing the abundance
analysis.

3.3.4 Radial velocities of clusters

The sample of non-spectroscopic binaries and bona-ﬁde
member stars is used to compute the cluster radial velocity.
Median values and M AD are found in Table 7 and plotted
in Fig. 6. We also list in Table 7 previous determinations
of the cluster radial velocity, for those references where a
mean value is given. All values from literature are compati-
ble within 3σ with the ones derived here.

The radial velocity dispersions within each cluster are
−1. The quoted dispersions are
found between 0.3 − 1.7 km s
the result of (a) the precision that we have in our radial ve-
locity determinations (Table 6), which is computed as the
line-by-line radial velocity variance found by DAOSPEC, (b)
a fraction of undetected binaries, and (c) the intrinsic inter-
nal dispersion of each cluster. In most of the cases the dis-
persions in Table 7 are at the level of the quoted precisions.
Only, the dispersion for NGC 6705 is very well above the un-
−1). This can be indicative that either
certainties (1.7 km s
this cluster has a larger fraction of undetected binaries, or
that this is indeed the instrinsic radial velocity dispersion,
and that this OC is kinematically hot. Given that the star by
star comparison of this cluster with the literature is coherent
within the uncertainties (Fig. 7, Table 6), we tend to think
that this is the intrinsic velocity dispersion. Moreover, this
OC is the most massive and youngest cluster in the sample.
Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2014b) selected bona-ﬁde members
−1 from
and found a mean radial velocity of 34.1 ± 1.5 km s
−1 from 536
21 stars (UVES targets), and 35.9 ± 2.8 km s
stars (GIRAFFE targets). Our result conﬁrms the high in-
trinsic velocity dispersion of this cluster.

3.4 Comparison with literature

We compared our ﬁnal values for each star (column 12 of Ta-
ble 6), with previous measurements in the literature, when
available (column 13 of Table 6). Since in most cases our
individual exposures are taken during the same night, this
external comparison is also useful to identify potential spec-
troscopic binaries.

Calculated diﬀerences with each author are shown in
Table 6 (column 14) and illustrated in Fig. 7. We exclude

M AD is assigned as the uncertainty, the number of stars considered as members and used to derive the cluster radial velocity are
written in parentheses. Other determinations of the cluster radial velocity are shown in column 3, and the reference is listed in column 4.
Diﬀerence between OCCASO and literature is computed as ∆v = vr − vr,lit. Notice: larger diﬀerences in the comparisons of NGC 1907
with Glushkova & Rastorguev (1991), and NGC 7789 are commented in the main text (Sec. 3.4 and 3.3.3.)

stars:

with Valitova et al. (1990), and a diﬀerence of only
−1 with Mermilliod et al. (2008). Given the
0.1 km s
small diﬀerences of the other stars in common with
Valitova et al. (1990), we consider this case an out-
lier in this comparison and we exclude it to calculate
the mean diﬀerence with these authors (Table 8). Our
three individual measurements are taken within the
same night (Table 5), so we cannot know if this star
is a spectroscopic binary. A large set of measurements
from Mermilliod et al. (2008) do not show variability.

(ii) NGC 1907 W0062: we ﬁnd a diﬀerence of 4.68 km s

with Glushkova & Rastorguev (1991). We have three
other stars from the cluster NGC 1907 in common with

3.5 Discussion: relation to the disc kinematics

As described in Sec. 2.1, Galactic disc kinematics is one of
the science topics of OCCASO. This section is devoted to
a preliminary analysis with the 12 OCs published here. A
more detailed investigation will be carried out when all ob-
servations will be completed and Gaia proper motions will
be available. Our analysis here is also limited by the small
range of Galactocentric distances of the 12 OCs, mainly in
the range 8–10 kpc. Most of the OCs studied here are lo-
cated in the vicinity of the Local arm. Three of them in the
Perseus arm, and only NGC 6705, is located in the Sagittar-
ius arm (see Fig. 9).

3.5.1 Radial velocity with respect to the GSR and RSR

Rest (LSR), and the circular motion of the LSR. Considering
only the line-of-sight component:

It is well known that the Galactocentric velocity of any
source in the Galactic disc can be described using two com-
ponents: (a) the velocity associated to a circular orbit around
the Galactic center, constrained by the Galactocentric dis-
tance and deﬁning the Regional Standard of Rest (RSR),
and (b) an additional peculiar velocity, the velocity with re-
spect to such RSR. The velocity with respect to RSR tells us
how much the motion of the cluster diﬀers from the Galactic
disc rotation.

One can compute the velocity with respect to the Galac-
tocentric Standard of Rest (GSR) by adding the spatial ve-
locity of the Sun to the measured heliocentric velocity. This
spatial velocity of the Sun is described in the same two com-
ponents: its velocity with respect to the Local Standard of

where vr is the heliocentric radial velocity, (U(cid:12), V(cid:12), W(cid:12)) are
the components of the motion of the Sun with respect to the
LSR, and Θ0 is the circular velocity at the Galactocentric
distance of the Sun R0.

The line-of-sight velocity with respect to the RSR can
be computed by subtracting the circular motion of the RSR
projected onto the line-of-sight:

cluster. Galactocentric distances R are computed from he-
liocentric distances in Dias et al. (2002)7 (see Table 1). Since
no error estimates are given for those distances, we adopted
an uncertainty of 0.2 mag in distance modulus, rather typ-
ical when determining distances from isochrone ﬁtting. The
errors in vGSR are computed taking into account errors in vr,
and the motion of the Sun: Θ0, U(cid:12), V(cid:12), and W(cid:12). The errors
in vRSR are computed taking into account also the errors in
distance modulus.

Figure 8 presents vGSR as a function of Galactic lon-
gitude8. The values corresponding to circular orbits at dif-
ferent radii have been overplotted. There is a good corre-
lation between the Galactocentric distance of each cluster
and the corresponding circular orbits, meaning that line-
of-sight vRSR are small. The obtained values of vRSR and
vGSR are listed in Table 9. The vRSR are in the range of
−1, typical values for the disc popula-
−27 to +24.7 km s
tions. Mean vRSR of the eight clusters located in the Local

arm is −2 km s
Again, rather typical.

We have also computed vRSR using diﬀerent assump-
tions for the Galactic rotation and Sun’s location taken from
Antoja et al. (2011) and Sofue et al. (2009). The mean dif-
ferences of vRSR from the diﬀerent assumptions are smaller
−1, well within uncertainties due to the errors
than 0.4 km s
in radial velocity and distances. Therefore, our vRSR do not
favour one or another Galactic rotation curve or location of
the Sun.

3.5.2 Spatial velocity with respect to RSR

Cluster line-of-sight velocities were combined with proper
motions to derive full spatial velocities. To do so, mean
proper motions were taken from Dias et al. (2014) and are
listed in Table 10. Dias et al. (2014) compared their mean
proper motions with other values in the literature and con-
cluded that mean diﬀerences and standard deviation were
−1. We have assumed uncertainties of
among 1.4–1.7 mas yr
−1 in each proper motion coordinate. The veloc-
1.5 mas yr
ity with respect to RSR in a cartesian Galactocentric frame,
(Us, Vs, Ws), was computed as (more details in the deriva-

IC 4756 and NGC 6633, both in the Local arm, are

circular velocity. Taken together, this may indicate some re-
lationship in their formation. Better uncertainties in proper
motions like the ones that Gaia will provide, and compari-
son of chemical abundances, (which is the main purpose of
OCCASO) will clarify this issue.

Finally, in Fig. 9 we have plotted the spatial distribu-
tion of the 12 OCs in the Galactic plane. The location of
the spiral arms, as derived by Reid et al. (2014), and the
(Us, Vs) components for each cluster have been overplotted.
High-mass star forming regions (HMSFR) studied by Reid
et al. (2014) are also included. We have calculated mean val-
ues and dispersions of the HMSFR (cid:104)Us(cid:105), (cid:104)Vs(cid:105), (cid:104)Ws(cid:105) in each
arm. And we have computed diﬀerences between the OCs
components and these mean values (see last three columns
in Table 10), to see if there exists a hint of dynamical re-
lationship between our OCs and the arms. In general, the
diﬀerences fall inside the 3σ margin except for the clusters
NGC 7789 (Perseus arm), NGC 7762 and NGC 6819 (Lo-
cal arm), and NGC 6705 (Saggitarius arm). We do not ﬁnd
correlations with age, but our sample is limited in number.
Again, precise proper motions of Gaia can help on the in-
terpretation of the kinematics of the studied clusters.

4 SUMMARY

The OCCASO survey has been designed to obtain radial
velocities and homogeneous abundances for more than 20
chemical species for RC stars in a sample of 25 Northern
OCs with ages (cid:38)0.3 Gyr. These data will allow us to prop-
erly analyze the existence of trends with RGC, z and age,
in the Galactic disc. Moreover, our sample of OCs is com-
plementary to GES-UVES observations of intermediate-age
and old Southern OCs. For this reason we include OCs in
common with GES to guarantee homogenity between both
surveys. At the end of both surveys, an homogeneous sample
of chemical abundances for around 50 OCs will be available.
We have collected observational data from high-
resolution spectroscopy during 53 nights of observation us-
ing the ﬁber-fed echelle spectrographs FIES and HERMES
at the ORM, and CAFE at CAHA. We have done a com-
parison among the results from the three instruments used,
obtaining a good agreement within the uncertainties.

The radial velocity analysis has been performed for 77
stars in 12 OCs. We have derived radial velocities from 401
individual exposures. With these values we have found a new
possible spectroscopic binary NGC 6819 W983, which has
never been identiﬁed as a multiple system. We have derived
radial velocities from the combined spectra with SNR(cid:62) 70,
−1. We have used
obtaining uncertainties of 0.5 − 0.9 km s
these values of the radial velocities to conﬁrm or discard
membership from our sample of stars and compute a median
radial velocity for each OC. In particular, we have obtained
radial velocities for OCs never studied before with high-

The radial velocities obtained in this paper agree with
the values from previous authors within the uncertainties,
except for few cases. We have compared the stars in com-
mon with other two large spectroscopic surveys: GES, 6
stars in common with an average diﬀerence of ∆vr =

expected rotation of the Milky Way assuming the rotation
curve derived by Reid et al. (2014).

Adding information of proper motions from Dias et al.
(2002) we have derived full spatial velocities, and we have
compared the non-circular velocities among them. There
seems to be no clear relation of the peculiar velocities among
the OCs from the same spiral arm (except for IC 4756 and
NGC 6633), nor with the peculiar velocities of the high-
mass star-forming regions (Reid et al. 2014) from the same
arms. From our sample we calculate the dispersion in the two
components of the plane velocity: σU and σV = 15 and 24
−1, which is expected for a population of ages 0.8–2.5
km s
Gyr as seen in Holmberg et al. (2009).
