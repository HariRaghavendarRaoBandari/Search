ABSTRACT

Whitbourn & Shanks (2014) have reported evidence for a local void underdense by
≈ 15% extending to 150-300h−1Mpc around our position in the Southern Galactic Cap
(SGC). Assuming a local luminosity function they modelled K- and r-limited number
counts and redshift distributions in the 6dFGS/2MASS and SDSS redshift surveys
and derived normalised n(z) ratios relative to the standard homogeneous cosmological
model. Here we test further these results using maximum likelihood techniques that
solve for the galaxy density distributions and the galaxy luminosity function simul-
taneously. We conﬁrm the results from the previous analysis in terms of the number
density distributions, indicating that our detection of the ‘Local Hole’ in the SGC
is robust to the assumption of either our previous, or newly estimated, luminosity
functions. However, there are discrepancies with previously published K and r band
luminosity functions. In particular the r-band luminosity function has a steeper faint
end slope than the r0.1 results of Blanton et al. (2003) but is consistent with the r0.1
results of Montero-Dorta & Prada (2009); Loveday et al. (2012).

INTRODUCTION

Our local galaxy clustering environment has recently as-
sumed even greater importance with the discovery that the
SNIa Hubble diagram can be ﬁtted by a Universe with an
accelerating expansion rate (Schmidt et al. 1998; Perlmut-
ter et al. 1999). Given the ﬁnely-tuned nature of the vacuum
energy that is implied by cosmological explanations of the
form of the Hubble diagram, (Carroll 2001) then there is
clear motivation to look for other explanations for this ob-
servation. This has led to a variety of activity investigating
whether the local expansion rate is faster than at larger dis-
tances due to the presence of a Local Hole or Void. Indeed,
there have been claims of a local underdensity manifesting as
a local rise in SNIa based measurements of H0 (Zehavi et al.
1998; Jha, Riess & Kirshner 2007). Although some authors
attribute these results to systematics associated with dust
(Conley et al. 2007) these results are consistent with other
work where bulk ﬂows out to z < 0.06 are found using SNIa
(Feindt et al. 2013; Colin et al. 2011; Wojtak et al. 2014) and
the tension between local and CMB determinations of H0
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014 - XVI). Some of the work
in this regard has even focussed on non-Copernican models
with the Local Group positioned at the centre of a large

void (Clarkson & Maartens 2010; Schwarz 2010; Krasi´nski
2014). Here we are investigating a simpler scenario where
the Local Group is at the edge of an underdense region that
covers much of the SGC. Evidence for such a possibility has
been presented by Shanks (1990), Zucca et al. (1997), Met-
calfe et al. (2001, 2006), Busswell et al. (2004) and Frith
et al. (2003); Frith, Outram & Shanks (2005); Frith, Shanks
& Outram (2005); Frith, Outram & Shanks (2006).

Following Frith et al, Whitbourn & Shanks (2014)
(the compansion study to this paper which we will refer
to thereafter as Paper I) have also recently presented ev-
idence for a local void with an ≈ 15% under-density out
to ≈ 150 − 300h−1Mpc. These authors used 6dFGS/2MASS
and SDSS redshift surveys to probe the local region by mod-
elling the n(z) distributions from three large regions of sky
covered by these surveys. They also used the z(m) technique
of Soneira (1979) to make a Hubble diagram based on the
redshift survey galaxies and showed that the data preferred a
model that showed coherent bulk motion out to 150h−1Mpc
compared to a model where the galaxy motions recovered
the CMB dipole within the survey region.

More recently Keenan et al. (2010, 2012); Keenan,
Barger & Cowie (2013), have compared galaxy counts and
luminosity density at high and low redshift and reported
evidence for a 300Mpc void with a 50% underdensity. Alter-
native probes than K-band galaxy surveys have also been
used to study this hypothesis. In particular B¨ohringer et al.

(2015) used the X-ray selected REFLEX II cluster survey.
These authors ﬁnd evidence for signiﬁcant underdensities
with conclusions broadly similar to those of Paper I.

In Paper I we traced the local n(z) using techniques
that assumed the form of the luminosity function from pre-
vious work. The assumed form was also inferred in the r
and K bands from original observations of LF’s as a func-
tion of galaxy morphology/B-V colour in the B band. Here
we return to the issue of the Local Hole now using maximum
likelihood methods (Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson 1988; Cole
2011; Choloniewski 1987) that solve for the galaxy density
run with redshift, φ(z), simultaneously with solving non-
parametrically for the luminosity function. The only param-
eters needed are simple forms for the K-correction and evo-
lution K + E terms.

In particular, we begin by describing the techniques
used in estimating the galaxy luminosity function and the
underlying density ﬁelds. We ﬁrst report the V /Vmax results
for the K-band and relate these results to the number count
slopes reported in Paper I. We then show the K-band lumi-
nosity functions and compare to the Metcalfe et al. (2001,
2006) LF assumed in determining the density proﬁles pre-
sented in Paper I. We proceed by presenting the density
proﬁles estimated in conjunction with the LF’s using ML
methods. We also include similar results for the r band SDSS
sample.

Throughout this paper we use a ﬂat ΛCDM (ΩΛ,0 =
0.7, Ωm,0 = 0.3) cosmology with Hubble constant H = 100h
kms−1 Mpc−1 with h = 0.7.

2 TECHNIQUES

We now brieﬂy describe the methods of estimating the
galaxy luminosity function (LF) used in this paper. Unless
otherwise stated we have estimated non-parametric lumi-
nosity functions using binsizes of dM = 0.5 and dµ = 0.25.

2.1 Non-parametric Luminosity Function

estimation

2.1.1 Vmax Luminosity Function

by a weighting factor (Ilbert et al. 2005). We have used
the magnitude dependent completeness factor described in
Appendix II of Paper I, i.e. 1/f (mi) where f (mi) is the
spectroscopic success function described in Paper I. We can
account for a bright magnitude limit by replacing Vmax by
Vmax −Vmin in the denominator of eq. 1 since this is now the
volume over which the survey is complete at this absolute
magnitude.

Whilst this estimator of the LF is minimum-variance
and maximum likelihood (ML) it is also biased as it assumes
homogeneity and will therefore be aﬀected by LSS (Felten
1976). Importantly, other LF estimators are unaﬀected by
LSS variations hence the diﬀerence between this LF estima-
tor and the others is therefore reﬂective of the presence of
LSS. Although this method oﬀers an estimate of the global
normalisation of the luminosity function, no estimate of the
density run φ(z) is available from this binned LF estimator.

2.1.2 NPML: Choloniewski-Peebles Luminosity Function

An alternative approach is a non-parametric maximum like-
lihood (NPML) method due to PJE Peebles (priv.comm.)
and Choloniewski (1986). The NPML method assumes sep-
arable densities ρi and luminosity function φj with Pois-
son distribution in the brightness-distance modulus plane
(M, µ). The probability for ni,j galaxies to occupy the i, jth
brightness-distance modulus bin is

p(N = nij ) =

exp−ρiφj (ρiφj)nij

nij !

.

(3)

Diﬀerentiating the log likelihood formed from these prob-
abilities gives estimates that can be solved iteratively
(Takeuchi, Yoshikawa & Ishii 2000)

φj =Xi

(5)

We have used the standard 1/Vmax estimator (Kafka 1967;
Schmidt 1968). This method assumes a homogeneous model
and estimates the luminosity function as

On the basis that the cross terms are zero the Fisher matrix
errors are simply

φ(M ) =

where Vmax is the comoving volume associated with the
maximum redshift this galaxy could be observed and
W (Mi − M ) is a window function describing the binning
dM assumed for the luminosity function, i.e.

W (Mi − M ) =(1

0

if − dM/2 6 (Mi − M ) 6 dM/2
if else

(2)

One advantage of this method is the relative ease with which
it can be extended to allow weighting of galaxies. This can
be achieved by replacing the unity argument of the win-
dow function for galaxies in the absolute magnitude bin dM

ρi

φj

(Pj nij )1/2
(Pi nij )1/2

This is a maximum likelihood method which is independent
of inhomogeneity (Choloniewski 1986). Furthermore, it also
oﬀers an estimate of the global normalisation of the luminos-
ity function and the density run φ(z). However the method’s
accuracy is dependent on galaxies being Poisson distributed
across the brightness and distance modulus binning. The va-
lidity of this assumption is improved by smaller bin sizes but
at the expense of possible bias (which increases with smaller
bin sizes) (Choloniewski 1986). We have used dM = 0.5,
dµ = 0.25 for the K band and dM = 0.2, dµ = 0.2 for the r
band.

2.2 Parametric Luminosity Function estimation

The LF and Local Hole

We have also used the C − method of Lynden-Bell (1971)
as updated by Choloniewski (1987). Here the distribution of
galaxies in the (M, µ) plane is used to infer a binned non-
parametric LF.

For a sample sorted from brightest to faintest we con-

struct the C − statistic as (Lynden-Bell 1971),

C − =

M <Mi

µj 6mf −M i

Xmb−M i6µj

wij ,

(8)

where wij is the weight of each galaxy which can be used
to account for incompleteness (Ilbert et al. 2005). We have
again accounted for incompleteness as wij = 1/f (mij ) where
f (mij ) is the spectroscopic success function described in Pa-
per I. The summation is deﬁned by the ranges associated
with the faint (mf ) and bright (mb) magnitude limits.

These C − coeﬃcients can then be related to the cumila-
tive LF Φ(M ) through a recursion relation. This method for
estimating the cumulative LF was modiﬁed by Choloniewski
(1987) who extended it to enable an estimate of the under-
lying LF with a global normalisation and a density proﬁle.
It is this version of the estimator that we use in this study.
Further discussion of the method can found in Choloniewski
(1987), Willmer (1997) and Takeuchi, Yoshikawa & Ishii
(2000).

2.1.4 Joint SWML method

The Efstathiou-Ellis-Peterson (EEP) estimator is a maxi-
mum likelihood (ML) which maximises the probability of
selection (Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson 1988),

p =

hood, L = QN

Here the bounds on the integral are deﬁned by the selection
criteria of the survey. We can therefore calculate the likeli-
i pi, over binned values of the LF to ﬁnd the
ML estimator. This binning of the LF requires the use of
step-functions in describing the ML solution. This step-wise
approach has led to the estimator being described as the
Step-Wise ML method. This method though has recently
been updated by Cole (2011) to jointly estimate the global
normalisation, density proﬁles and the LF (JSWML). It is
this JSWML version of the non-parametric ML method that
is used in this study.

Our implementation of this method is based on a mod-
iﬁed version of the JSWML code provided by Cole et al.
(2001)1. We have used the default settings except for im-
plementing the K+E corrections described in Sec. 3.1, the
speciﬁc cosmological parameters used in this paper and the
absolute magnitude range required.

1 These modiﬁcations resolved issues with the absolute magni-
tude bin centres and the number of redshift bins.

The estimation of Luminosity functions can be analytically
simpliﬁed by assuming a parametric form. This is typically
achieved for galaxies by using a Schechter (1976) ﬁt.

2.2.1 STY Luminosity Function

The Sandage-Tammann-Yahil (STY) method is akin to
the EEP and JSWML methods in that it is a maximum-
likelihood estimator (Sandage, Tammann & Yahil 1979).
i pi, over
a plane of possible values of the Schechter parametrisations
(α, M∗) to ﬁnd the MLE of the LF parameters.

Here though we calculate the likelihood, L = QN

We have evaluated L(α, M∗) over α ∈ [0.8, 1.6] and have
adapted the range for M∗ for each sample on the basis of
the estimated covariance matrix. In both cases we have used
binsizes of 0.01. Incompleteness eﬀects can be accounted for
by weighting each probability as pwi
i where wi is the inverse
of the spectroscopic success function f (m) described in Pa-
per I. For a fuller discussion and a full expansion of the log
likelihood - see (Zucca, Pozzetti & Zamorani 1994; Zucca
et al. 1997). We note that this method estimates Schechter
LF parameters (α, M∗) but does not provide any estimate of
the global normalisation φ∗ or the density proﬁle. It should
also be noted that the accuracy of the STY LF estimates
is dependent on the validity/accuracy of the assumed para-
metric form.

2.3 Luminosity Function and Density Proﬁle

Normalisation

2.3.1 Luminosity Function Normalisation

An LF normalisation is related to the spatial number density
as,

n =Z ∞

−∞

φ(M )dM.

(10)

A minimum variance estimator (n3) was found by Davis &
Huchra (1982) and has been commonly used. However, it
is not an unbiased estimator for inhomogeneous samples as
the number density is also present in the galaxy weighting.
Although this eﬀect is expected to be small (Willmer 1997;
Keenan et al. 2012) we have decided to use an unbiased
estimator of the number density (Davis & Huchra 1982).

0 (N (z)/s(z))dz

n1 = R zf

0 dV

R zf

(11)

Here s(z) is the galaxy selection function and N (z) is the
redshift distribution of galaxies. The disadvantage of this es-
timator is the instability associated with its heavier weight-
ing of higher redshift objects where the selection function is
more uncertain. Various methods such as using medians etc
have been proposed for improving the robustness of these
estimators (de Lapparent, Geller & Huchra 1989). We con-
sider a high redshift cut-oﬀ of zf = 0.04 and zf = 0.075
in the estimation of n1 for the K and r-band respectively
(i.e. approximately the maximum of the respective redshift
distributions). The resulting unbiased estimator n1 can then
be used to normalise φ(M ) following eq. 10.

2.3.2 Density Proﬁle Normalisation

We have considered a variety of methods for normalising
the density proﬁles. In Willmer (1997) it was shown that a
number count type estimator is relatively unbiased as com-
pared to other MLE density estimates. These MLE estimates
showed an ≈ 20% bias towards underestimating density.
The results presented in this study are therefore based on a
number count normalisation derived for each respective LF
estimate. The number count normalisation has been made
by estimating the change in φ∗ required to ﬁt the number
counts (as per the method in Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson
(1988)) and scaling the density proﬁles accordingly.

We have ensured that these number count based results
are consistent with the n1 estimator used in normalising
the LF’s by considering a number density proﬁle estimator
derived from the n1 estimator, i.e. the ratio of the expected
number of galaxies in a redshift shell of thickness dz and the
volume of the redshift shell

n(z)
n1

=

N (z)/s(z)

dz dz

(12)

The results obtained using the unbiased n1 estimator are in
agreement with those shown, but with larger uncertainities.
For further detail of the techniques we use in estimating the
LF and its normalisation - see Johnston (2011).

3 DATA & MODELLING

The imaging and redshift surveys used here are the same as
those used in Paper I, namely 2MASS and SDSS for NIR
and optical imaging and 6dFGS and SDSS for K and r lim-
ited galaxy redshift surveys. We again adopt the Vega pho-
tometric system and use the Local-group rest frame whilst
adopting the transformations outlined in Paper I. We also
reprise the magnitude estimators used in Paper I, i.e. a scale
error corrected form of the ‘k m ext’ magnitude for 2MASS
objects and the ‘cmodel’ magnitude for SDSS objects - see
Whitbourn & Shanks (2014) for further discussion. To min-
imise the eﬀects of incompleteness for the r-band sample we
have employed the more conservative magnitude selection
10<r<17 than was used in Paper I. We have used an ex-
panded 7.5<K<12.5 selection criteria for the K band. We
now use a 7.5<K bright limit rather than the 10<K used
in Paper I in order to maximise sample completeness whilst
avoiding the range aﬀected by 2MASS deblending issues.

We have used a faint absolute magnitude limit of M −
5 log h 6 −18 and M − 5 log h 6 −15 for the K and r band
respectively. We have ensured the accuracy of our modelling
procedures by validating with respect to simulated data.

Within these surveys we again use the same large target
ﬁelds as used in Paper I (see Fig. 1 and Table 3 of Paper
I). These regions are chosen so as to be relatively similar in
their dimensions, whilst being as large as their constituent
surveys’ geometry allows a coherent ﬁeld to be. The largest
ﬁelds possible were preferred since these should minimise
cosmic variance (each represents ≈ 1/15 of the sky). These
ﬁelds were also selected to represent regions of interest such
as the CMB heliocentric dipole pointing and the Great At-
tractor whilst avoiding the galactic plane.

being northern or southern, and use the diﬀerent surveys to
further distinguish the two galactic northern ﬁelds ie: SDSS-
NGC, 6dFGS-NGC and 6dFGS-SGC.

3.1 K-corrections and Evolution

We have followed Paper I in assuming simple representations
of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) K-correction plus evolution
models as used by Metcalfe et al to ﬁt galaxy counts and
colours to much higher redshifts than those discussed here.
For simplicity we have used a simple representation for
the τ = 2.5Gyr, x = 3 and τ = 9Gyr, x = 1.35 K+E
corrections for early-type and late-type galaxies in the K
band. For both types there is little diﬀerence here between
the K- and K+E corrections out to z ≈ 0.3.

In the r-band there is a bigger diﬀerence between the
K and the K+E corrections. We therefore use the average
r-band K+E-correction for early-type and spirals assuming
the same Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models as for K above.
Although there is a slight approximation here involved in
taking an average K+E/K-correction at the z = 0.1 limit of
the range of interest the diﬀerence is only 0.05-0.06mags.

3.2 Error Calculation

To estimate random errors we use 10◦ × 10◦ sub-ﬁelds to
calculate jack-knife errors as used in Paper I. We found the
number of subﬁelds only weakly eﬀect error estimates. The
only exception to this is our use of Fisher matrix errors in
the case of the NPML LF estimator.

4 LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS

4.1 V /Vmax Histograms

Before studying the LF estimates we ﬁrst probe the V /Vmax
statistic. This is of particular interest because it is closely
related to the 1/Vmax LF estimator but is also dependent on
the homogeneity of the sample - see Sec. 2.1.1. The V /Vmax
statistic has been calculated using the 7.5<K<12.5 selection
criteria, incompleteness correction and the K+E prescrip-
tion outlined in Sec. 3.1. The homogeneous expectation is
therefore that the samples are uniformly distributed over
the volume probed and hence the mean V /Vmax = 0.5.

We now show in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 a histogram of this
statistic for the K band data over our three target re-
gions with a binning of d(V /Vmax) = 0.1. We ﬁnd for the
6dFGS-NGC, 6dFGS-SGC and SDSS-NGC regions mean
values of V /Vmax of (0.498 ± 0.008), (0.523 ± 0.007) and
(0.522±0.005) respectively. We conclude that in the 6dFGS-
SGC and SDSS-NGC regions the data is not consistent with
a uniform distribution and is in fact increasing with V /Vmax.
Given that incompleteness eﬀects have been included in the
calculation of Vmax the signiﬁcant excess above the homo-
geneous prediction in the 6dFGS-SGC and SDSS-NGC re-
gions indicates that these samples are being preferentially
distributed at higher redshifts. We therefore conclude that
there is signiﬁcant evidence for an inhomogeneity, and in
particular a local underdensity, on the basis of the V /Vmax
statistic alone.

We will use galactic coordinates to deﬁne the ﬁelds as

We also note that the sloping of the V /Vmax statistic is

closely related to the rising number counts of these samples
as was observed in Paper I. Indeed it is the 6dFGS-SGC re-
gion which has the most pronounced sloping in V /Vmax and
was the most underdense in Paper I. Clearly however deter-
mining the density proﬁle and its run with redshift requires
solving for the density proﬁle. But ﬁrst we now investigate
whether the LF of these samples is consistent with those of
the Metcalfe et al. (2001, 2006) LF assumed in determining
the density proﬁles presented in Paper I.

4.2 K band LF estimates

We next use the LF estimators described in Sec. 2 to esti-
mate the K band LF in our three regions. In Fig. 4, 5 and 6
we show these estimates for the 6dFGS-NGC, 6dFGS-SGC
and SDSS-NGC regions respectively. These LF’s have been
normalised using their respective estimate of n1.

Treating these ﬁelds in turn, we begin with the 6dFGS-
NGC ﬁeld shown in Fig. 4. We ﬁrst note that the LF es-
timators are in agreement with the Metcalfe et al. (2001,
2006) type dependent Schechter LF (green solid line) until
the very bright end (< M∗ − 2). The Metcalfe et al LF is
an optical LF which is translated into the NIR using an as-
sumed mean colour so this agreement was not to be taken for
granted. We also note that the parametric Schechter func-
tion ﬁts provided by the STY method is in agreement with
the other non-parametric LF estimates over much of the
range in absolute magnitude. However, for the very bright
end (< M∗ − 2) the STY result is an underestimate with re-
spect to the nonparametric estimates. We interpret this as
suggesting that Schechter parametrisation of the LF is accu-
rate in the main but does not fully represent the abundance

of very bright objects such as Brightest Cluster galaxies - a
conclusion also reached by other authors (Jones et al. 2006).
For the 6dFGS-SGC region shown in Fig. 5 we see a
similar set of estimates to those obtained in the 6dFGS-
NGC region up until the faint end (< M∗ + 2). The Metcalfe
et al LF is a reasonable ﬁt to all the estimators over all
but the brightest and faintest magnitudes. Indeed, this time
the parametric estimator, the STY method, agrees well with
the non-parametric estimates except for < M∗ − 2 and <
M∗ + 2. We again assign this relative excess of faint objects
and deﬁcit of bright objects relative to the nonparametric
ﬁts as due to a limitation of this parametrisation. We also
note that the Vmax estimator is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
the other estimates. We attribute this to the inhomogeneity
reported in this ﬁeld in Paper I. This is consistent with the
elevated value of hV /Vmaxi = (0.523 ± 0.007) in this region
as discussed in Sec. 4.

Now in Fig. 6 we show the LF estimators for SDSS-NGC
region. We draw similar conclusions to the previous 6dFGS-
SGC region. In particular the V /Vmax LF estimate is again
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the other estimators, especially
at the faint end. We again attribute this to a signiﬁcant in-
homogeneity as indicated in this ﬁeld by the elevated value
of hV /Vmaxi = (0.522 ± 0.005) discussed in Sec. 4. We also
observe that whilst the STY α estimates are mutually con-
sistent between the ﬁelds the diﬀerences in the M∗ estimates,
although small, are signiﬁcant. But in any case the diﬀer-
ences are relatively minor in the sense that the Metcalfe et
al LF is a good representation of all the LF estimators exc-
cept at the bright end. However, we do note that the bright
end excess relative the Schechter parametric ﬁts is less pro-
nounced in this ﬁeld.

We therefore conclude that the Metcalfe et al LF is,

for all three ﬁelds, an adequate ﬁt to the majority of the
K band LF estimators. We take this as providing evidence
supporting our assumption of the Metcalfe et al LF in our
previous study - Paper I - and hence the density proﬁles we
then estimated using number counts. However, we can now
continue this investigation beyond the LF and make use of
the density proﬁles and normalisation information provided
by the various LF estimates to study the homogeneity of our
samples.

5 K BAND NORMALISED NUMBER

DENSITY PROFILES

As outlined in Sec. 2 we can use the NPML, JSWML and
C − methods to estimate the run of the number density pro-
ﬁle. The normalisations used are dependent on the estima-
tor. The proﬁles presented here have been normalised using
their respective LF based number counts. Similar results, at
greater uncertainty, are found when using the n1 unbiased
number density estimator (i.e. eq. 12) calculated using the
corresponding LF. We now present in Fig. 7, 8 and 9 these
number density proﬁles for the 6dFGS-NGC, 6dFGS-SGC
and SDSS-NGC regions respectively.

For the 6dFGS-NGC region (Fig. 7) we observe good
consistency between the various estimates of the number
density run. We can also see the inhomogeneity inferred
from this ﬁeld’s V /Vmax statistic in that locally (z < 0.05)
the proﬁles are typically underdense and then transition to
being reasonably homogeneous. We also observe signiﬁcant
LSS clustering with signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the density
proﬁle at z ≈ 0.048 which we attribute to the Shapley-
8 supercluster. We also note that this proﬁle is similar to

that presented in Paper I (Fig. 3a) for the 6dFGS-NGC ﬁeld
where the Metcalfe et al LF was assumed. This is inline with
the agreement we noted in Sec. 4.2 between the Metcalfe et
al LF and the LF estimates we have made here.

In Fig. 8 we show the number density proﬁle for the
6dFGS-SGC ﬁeld. We again see good agreement between the
diﬀerent estimators of the density proﬁle. However, at high
redshift (z > 0.05) the NPML estimate is signiﬁcantly higher
than the JSWML and C − estimates. This is true for all
three K-band ﬁelds and may therefore be indicative of a lack
of robustness at high redshift for the NPML estimate. All
proﬁle estimates are particularly underdense at local redshift
with the JSWML and C − becoming homogeneous at deeper
redshifts. We again note the agreement with the Paper I
(Fig. 3b) number density proﬁle for this ﬁeld which once
more reﬂects the validity of the Metcalfe et al LF for the
sample in this ﬁeld.

Finally, in Fig. 9 we show the number density proﬁle
for the SDSS-NGC region. Here we see a similar pattern
of agreement between the diﬀerent density proﬁles. The
JSWML, NPML and C − proﬁles are in agreement at low
redshift in showing an underdense proﬁles with signiﬁcant
LSS (which we attribute to Coma at z = 0.023). At deeper
redshifts (z > 0.08) the density proﬁles show evidence of
an extensive overdensity. We return to investigate this issue
using the deeper r band data over the same ﬁeld. However,
we also note that this substantially inhomogeneous proﬁle
is in agreement with the density proﬁle estimated in Paper
I (Fig. 3c).

We have evaluated the corresponding number under-

density indicated by these proﬁles as

· dV

dz dz

The average of the proﬁle number underdensities are
reported in Table 1 for z < 0.05, i.e. ≈ 150h−1Mpc, and z <
0.1, i.e. ≈ 300h−1Mpc in the 6dFGS-NGC, 6dFGS-SGC and
SDSS-NGC regions. Errors have been inferred using jacknife
estimates. We noted earlier the potential lack of robustness
at high redshift for the NPML estimator. We have therefore
disregarded the NPML proﬁles in calculating the z < 0.1
average underdensities.

These results are broadly consistent with the under-
densities reported in Paper I (Table 4) - aside from the
6dFGS-SGC estimate. In this case, both the z < 0.05 (now
0.76 ± 0.05, previously 0.60 ± 0.05) and z < 0.1 results (now
1.02 ± 0.11, previously 0.75 ± 0.04) are less underdense. In-
deed the z < 0.1 result is now consistent with homogeneity,
albeit with larger errors. However, this diﬀerence is relatively
minor in that the results presented here based on number
count normalised number density proﬁles are in agreement
with the 6dFGS-SGC number count underdensity reported
in Paper I (0.76 ± 0.03).

We therefore conclude that the density proﬁles show
evidence for a LSS local underdensity for z < 0.05 which the
SDSS-NGC ﬁeld in particular suggests may extend to deeper
depths (≈ 300h−1Mpc). These conclusions are in agreement
with those presented in Paper I which reﬂects the agreement
found here with the Metcalfe et al LF which was assumed
in that study.

6 r 6 17 LF AND DENSITY PROFILES IN THE

SDSS-NGC REGION

Using the SDSS survey it is possible to go to deeper survey
limits than in the K-band. In particular, following Paper I,
we use an r band limited sample in order to investigate the
SDSS-NGC ﬁeld. We have used a more conservative r-band
magnitude limit of r 6 17 than the r 6 17.2 limit used in
Paper I in order to minimise any potential biasing/issues
associated with spectroscopic incompleteness.

Now in Fig. 10 we show the V /Vmax estimates. We re-
port a mean value of (0.500±0.003). This value is consistent
with the homogeneous expectation and indeed the unifor-
mity in this statistic shows little evidence for an underden-
sity. This is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the slope observed in
Fig. 3 where the K band SDSS-NGC V /Vmax estimates are
shown. A similar and related situation was encountered in
Paper I when comparing the results r and K band counts
over the same ﬁeld. Here it was concluded that the evi-
dence for an underdensity in the r band was more ambigious
and more suggestive of 150h−1 scale underdensity which
was punctuated by the strong clustering associated with the
Coma supercluster. This is potentially consistent with the
broader smoothing eﬀect of the d(V /Vmax) = 0.1 binning
used for the deeper r band sample which may smooth over
local variations in the density proﬁle. We therefore proceed
to investigate r-band LF’s and the resulting density proﬁles.
In Fig. 11 we show the LF estimates for the SDSS-NGC
region r band data. We see that there is good agreement be-
tween the variety of LF estimates except for the very bright-
est objects (< M∗ − 3). We also note that the C − estima-
tor has a shallower faint end slope than compared to our
other LF estimators. However, again, these diﬀerences are
relatively minor in that the Metcalfe et al LF is a good rep-
resentation of our results over a wide range of magnitudes.
We therefore show in Fig. 12 the density proﬁles asso-
ciated with JSWML, C − and NPML LF estimates r-band
SDSS-NGC density proﬁles. The JSWML, C − and NPML
proﬁles are in good agreement in showing underdense pro-
ﬁles with signiﬁcant LSS (which we attribute to Coma at
z = 0.023). At deeper redshifts (z > 0.08) the C −, NPML
and JSWML density proﬁles remain signiﬁcantly inhomo-
geneous. This is consistent with the investigation of fainter
GAMA K band and SDSS r band n(m) and n(z) in Paper
I which indicated that an inhomogeneity could extend be-
yond z = 0.1 in the SDS-NGC region. We also note that
the r-band density proﬁles demonstrate a similar local un-

derdensity (z < 0.08) to that seen over the same ﬁeld in the
K band (see Fig. 9).

Finally, we have evaluated the average number under-
density following eq. 13 with the results shown in Table 2.
We now include the NPML density proﬁles for the z < 0.1
results as there is no evidence of lack of robustness at high
redshift for the r band sample. For z < 0.05 we ﬁnd an aver-
age number underdensity of [0.83 ± 0.05] which is in agree-
ment with the K band SDSS-NGC results in suggesting a sig-
niﬁcant local number underdensity (≈ 150h−1Mpc). Whilst
the z < 0.1 average number underdensity of [0.90 ± 0.03]
indicates a more extensive inhomogeneity on ≈ 300h−1Mpc
scales. Both these results are in agreement with the results
presented in Paper I.

We conclude that the r-band density proﬁles show evi-
dence for an underdensity, which is punctuated by the Coma
cluster producing a strong overdensity. This underdensity is
similar to those observed for the corresponding region in the
K band (Fig. 9) but less than that observed in the K band
over the Southern galactic cap (Fig. 8).

7 DISCUSSION

We note that any estimation of the luminosity function is
strongly dependent on accurate and stable galaxy photom-
etry. Paper I includes a fuller discussion of the photometric
completeness of these samples. However, we have estimated
the eﬀect of magnitude errors on our NIR LF estimation
using the method of Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson (1988)
where the observed LF is described as the convolution of
the true underlying LF with a magnitude error kernel, i.e.
φobs(M ) = g(M ) ⊗ φtrue(M ). Using realistic magnitude er-
ror kernels derived from Fig. A1 of Paper I we ﬁnd that
the eﬀects of magnitude errors on the K-band LF typically
steepen the faint end slope by ≈ 0.1 and similarly to brighten
the characteristic magnitude by ≈ 0.1. We have investigated
the uncertainty this corresponds to in our determination of
the galaxy number density proﬁles by testing the variation
induced in the Cole (2011) density proﬁles if a realistic mag-
nitude error is allowed. We found that the changes were
small, typically < 1 − 2% (K and r band respectively) and
random in nature. It should be noted that larger (≈ 5%)
variations were possible for low and high z (z < 0.01 and
z > 0.1). However, over the redshift range of interest we
conclude that magnitude errors only weakly aﬀect our den-
sity proﬁle estimates.

We again follow Paper I in the treatment of complete-
ness issues. We note that the inclusion of corrections for
incompleteness detailed for the Vmax, C − and STY meth-
ods are relatively minor in determining the LF or number
density proﬁles. Finally, we also again note that we have
used the vc 2MASS quality ﬂag to reject artifact and non-
extragalactic objects. This ensures that ≈100% of objects
7.5<K<12.5 have been visually inspected to ensure a high
purity sample.

An important assumption in this work has been the use
of the K + E prescriptions used in (Metcalfe et al. 2001,
2006). In order to explain the observed underdensity we
would require evolutionary brightening at z ≈ 0.1 or a more
negative K-correction. As was noted in Paper I an argument
against the rise in number density being caused by z ≈ 0.1
galaxy evolution is the rise in number counts across the NIR
and optical bands (B,R,I,H,K) Metcalfe et al. (2001, 2006).
A local under-density produces just this, an approximately
band-independent rise in the bright number counts whereas
evolutionary eﬀects correspond to a greater eﬀect in the
bluer bands and at fainter magnitudes. We also note that
in Paper I we investigated alternative evolutionary models
as well as no evolutionary corrections and found minimal
diﬀerences in the K-band (although not for the r-band) in
terms of derived redshift distributions and number counts.
The three ﬁelds studied here are wide-ﬁeld, with each
representing ≈ 1/15 of the sky. However, they are consid-
erably smaller than the full sky 2MASS sample from which
they are drawn. We note however that Appleby & Shaﬁeloo
(2014) have investigated the isotropy of LF shape estimates
using the 2MPZ, a set of photometric redshifts estimated
in Bilicki et al. (2014) for the 2MASS-XSC sample. These
authors ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence for anisotropy in non-
parametric LF shape estimates. This suggests that the three
ﬁelds used in this study should be representative of the full
2MASS survey. It should be noted that the LF normalisa-
tion was not investigated in this paper so this result is not in

tension with the varying galaxy number density proﬁles pre-
sented in this study. Furthermore, it is also of interest that
these authors report weak evidence for a dipole asymmetry
in parametric LF estimates between the north and south
galactic plane. This is again in agreement with the signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent density proﬁles found for the 6DFGS-SGC,
6DFGS-NGC and SDSS-NGC regions.

Other estimates of the NIR LF using these samples have
been attempted. We therefore now present in Fig. 13 and 14
a comparison to other studies estimates of the Schechter α
and M∗ parameters. In Fig. 13 we show a comparison of the
full φ(M ) because it captures the correlation between the α
and M∗ parameters. We also include in this comparison our
JSWML non parametric LF estimates (SDSS-NGC) so that
any deviations from the Schechter form can be judged. After
normalising to a common and arbritrary number density
(estimated using the Metcalfe et al LF over the range −28 6
M − 5 log(h) 6 −18) we ﬁnd that the K-band LF estimates
are relatively consistent, except at the faint end where there
is greater variance. In particular, the Metcalfe et al LF shows
a much steeper faint-end slope than found by Bell et al.
(2003) using the Vmax estimator with the 2MASS survey. We
attribute this to photometric problems in the early 2MASS
data releases since in the same work the g-band selected NIR
LF was estimated to have a faint end slope of α = −1.33
which is in rough agreement with the steeper slope of the
Metcalfe et al LF.

In Fig. 14 most K-band LF parameterisations occupy
the usual degenerate strip between M ∗ and α. The one that
most deviates from this line is the LF of Jones et al. (2006)
(see also Fig.13). We also note that the variation between
diﬀerent LF estimates is much larger than would be expected
on the basis of the ‘naive’ error ellipses (i.e. the no covariance
case). We do not understand what causes these diﬀerences
but potential causes of diﬀerences are diﬀerent treatment of
ﬂow models, incompleteness, as well as real diﬀerences in
sample selection (magnitude limits, redshift ranges etc).

We have made a similar comparison for r band LF es-
timates in Fig. 15 and 16. We have again normalised to
an arbitrary number density estimated using the Metcalfe
et al LF over the range −25 6 M − 5 log(h) 6 −15. Re-
sults quoted in the r0.1 band (i.e. corrected to a z = 0.1
rest frame as per Blanton et al. (2003)) have been converted
into the r band as r0.1 ≈ r + 0.23 (Nichol et al. 2006). We
ﬁnd results that are consistent with the Metcalfe et al LF.
However the Blanton et al. (2003) and Driver et al. (2012)
estimates show a signiﬁcantly sharper bright end fall oﬀ and
a shallower faint end slope than the Metcalfe et al LF. The
greater uncertainties in the assumed evolutionary model for
the r-band as compared to the K may explain the diﬀerence
with the Driver et al. (2012) LF since the GAMA survey
probes a substantially deeper redshift range than the sam-
ples used in this paper. However, this is an an unlikely ex-
planation for the diﬀerence with the Blanton et al. (2003)
LF, especially as any evolutionary modelling eﬀects would
be expected to primarily aﬀect M∗ estimates. It is therefore
unclear why these results are diﬀerent from those presented
here. However, we agree with the observation of Montero-
Dorta & Prada (2009) that the size of the SDSS sample
has increased considerably since the pre SDSS-DR1 results
used in Blanton et al. (2003). The resulting improvements
in magnitude limits may have resulted in substantial im-

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–13

provements in sample selection. The potential uncertainty
that diﬀerences in the LF correspond to in the number den-
sity proﬁles is indicated by the diﬀerences between the C −,
JSWML and NPML density proﬁles in Fig. 12. This is par-
ticularly relevant in the case of the C − LF estimate where
we ﬁnd a ﬂatter faint end slope than the JSWML or NPML
estimates (see Fig. 11) but nevertheless ﬁnd similar number
density proﬁles.

Again many, r-band LF parameterisations occupy the
usual degenerate strip between M ∗ and α in Fig. 16. The two
that most deviate from this line are the LF’s of Loveday et al.
(2012) and Montero-Dorta & Prada (2009) (see also Fig.15).
However, this small deviation may be attributable to the
correction applied to convert from the r0.1 and r bands. Fig.
16 also conﬁrms the much ﬂatter parametric faint end slope
reported by Blanton et al. (2003) than seen by later authors,
including ourselves.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We have used samples from 6dFGS/2MASS and SDSS to
simultaneously investigate the local LF and galaxy number
density proﬁles. We have studied three large volumes which
cover much of the sky and ﬁnd evidence for an anisotropic
galaxy distribution. In particular we observe a local num-
ber underdensity out to ≈ 150h−1Mpc around our posi-
tion in the Southern galactic cap which both the r and
K band SDSS-NGC samples suggest may extend deeper to
≈ 300h−1Mpc. We have also found evidence that the Met-
calfe et al LF assumed in Paper I is an adequate ﬁt for these
samples and hence the density proﬁles presented there may
be unbiased by this choice. This work also complements pre-
vious studies which have investigated variation of luminosity
density with redshift Keenan et al. (2012); Keenan, Barger &
Cowie (2013) by providing estimates of variation in number
density. The estimate made in Paper I of a ≈ −15% number
underdensity is broadly consistent with the Keenan, Barger
& Cowie (2013) estimate of a ≈ 50% increase in luminosity
between the local universe and z ≈ 0.1.

A signiﬁcant advantage of investigating both the K and
r bands is that an underdensity might be indicated if the ef-
fect is band independent, although a band-dependent result
might still be explained by diﬀerent galaxy clustering bias
applying in the diﬀerent bands. We note that the r-band
SDSS-NGC proﬁle (Fig. 12) shows a similar underdensity
to the corresponding K-band estimate (Fig. 9) with only
small diﬀerences at low redshift. But both are in agreement
in supporting an underdensity continuing beyond z ≈ 0.1.
One important route for continuing the investigation into
the isotropy of the galaxy distribution will be the incorpo-
ration of peculiar velocity ﬁelds. We therefore believe that
the ongoing investigation into the 6DFGS peculiar velocity
ﬁeld as determined using the fundamental plane (and its
comparison to that inferred from PSCz) started in Springob
et al. (2014) will be of particular interest. We note that the
inital analysis presented in Springob et al. (2014) is in agree-
ment with the PSCz estimated density ﬁeld (to a seperately
estimated 2MRS peculiar velocity ﬁeld based on a update
of Erdo˘gdu et al. (2006)) which has a mean underdensity
of -11% within 180h−1Mpc. The density proﬁles presented
here are consistent with such a local underdensity.
