ABSTRACT
We present Str¨omgren photometry of the Galactic Globular Cluster M3 to study its multiple
generations phenomenon. The use of different colour-magnitude diagrams and especially of
the notoriously efﬁcient cy index allowed us to detect a double Red Giant Branch in the cluster
CMD. After decontamination from fore- and background sources, the two sequences turned
out to be equally populated. The two components also show a bimodal radial distribution well
corresponding to that predicted by numerical simulations for clusters living in an intermediate
dynamical evolutive state and with a population with modiﬁed chemical composition that was
born more centrally concentrated than the primordial. The analysis of high-resolution spectra
quantitatively demonstrates that the two detected sequences correspond to the ﬁrst (Na-poor)
generation and the second (Na-rich) generation, thus conﬁrming the importance of synergy
between photometry and spectroscopy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) had been considered the best
example of simple stellar population (e.g., Renzini & Buzzoni
1986). However, in the last decades strong observational evi-
dence has been gathered to prove that this is only a ﬁrst approx-
imation. In fact, GCs host multiple populations of stars differ-
ing in terms of chemical composition (for a recent review see
Gratton, Carretta, & Bragaglia 2012) which also reﬂects in spreads
and splits of the evolutionary sequences in colour-magnitude dia-
grams (CMDs, see e.g., Monelli et al. 2013; Piotto et al. 2015).

totally understood yet

The multiple population phenomenon is very complex
(see Salaris & Cassisi 2014;
and not
Bastian, Cabrera-Ziri, & Salaris
2015).
The most common chemical signature of GCs is the star-
to-star dispersion in light elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al),
and bi- or multi-modality (see
showing anti-correlations
Gratton, Carretta, & Bragaglia (2012)). All
the massive Milky
Way GCs studied so far,1 show the Na-O anti-correlation (see

2015a; Renzini et al.

Carretta et al. 2009a for an extensive database, Bragaglia et al.
2015 and references therein) and some of them also show a
Mg-Al anti-correlation (e.g., Carretta et al. 2009b; M´esz´aros et al.
2015). Up to now, a sub-sample of properly studied (see
Bastian, Cabrera-Ziri, & Salaris 2015b and references therein)
show evidence of
internal helium variation, with extreme
cases being ω-Centauri (Bedin et al. 2004; Piotto et al. 2005;
Dupree & Avrett 2013) and NGC 2808 (D’Antona et al. 2005;
Piotto et al. 2007; Dalessandro et al. 2011; Pasquini et al. 2011;
Milone et al. 2015; Massari et al. 2016).

Much less common is instead an internal dispersion in iron
content, often combined with a dispersion in neutron-capture ele-
ments. Apart from the extreme cases of ω Cen (Norris & Da Costa
1995; Lee et al. 1999; Johnson & Pilachowski 2010; Marino et al.
2011b) and Terzan 5 (Ferraro et al. 2009; Origlia et al. 2011, 2013;
Massari et al. 2014a), with variation larger than 1 dex, several
other clusters show variations of (some) 0.1 dex at most. M54

1 The only exception to date is Ruprecht 106 (Villanova et al. 2013),
which is massive and relatively young. Terzan 8, a GC belonging to

the Sgr dSph, shows a hint of Na enhancement in a minority of stars
(Carretta et al. 2014), while Terzan 7 and Pal 12, another two Sgr clusters,
do not show anti-correlations, albeit on very small samples (Sbordone et al.
2004; Tautvaiˇsien˙e et al. 2004; Cohen 2004).

but see also Lardo, Mucciarelli, & Bastian 2016 who found the
cluster to have only a very small iron-enriched population) belong
to this class of object. For other clusters like M22 (Marino et al.
2011a; Mucciarelli et al. 2015a), NGC3201 (Mucciarelli et al.
2015b) and NGC1851 (Carretta et al. 2011a; Yong & Grundahl
2008) the existence of an intrinsic iron spread is still a matter of
debate. Since a spread in the iron content might only be explained
in terms of supernovae ejecta self-enrichment, for all these clusters
a peculiar origin is usually invoked.

Photometric studies showed that the GC multiple population
phenomenon (in the following, we will refer to the terms popu-
lation and generation without distinction, since it is beyond the
aim of this paper to favour multiple population scenarios which
support multiple episode of star formation as in Decressin et al.
2007; D’Ercole et al. 2008, or which do not, see Bastian et al.
2013) can be addressed in detail using a proper combination of ﬁl-
ters (see e.g. Han et al. 2009; Carretta et al. 2011b; Milone et al.
2012; Monelli et al. 2013). In this sense, one of the best way to
study the multiple populations of GCs comes from medium-band
Str¨omgren uvby photometry. In fact the u and v ﬁlters of this set
cover the spectral region including the NH and CN molecular bands
at 3400 ˚A and 4316 ˚A, respectively, and they are therefore sensi-
tive to variations in the C and N abundances. The proof of the
efﬁciency of Str¨omgren photometry for this kind of study comes
from both observational and theoretical works such as Yong et al.
(2008); Carretta et al. (2011b); Sbordone et al. (2011); Roh et al.
(2011), where the authors built suitable combination of ﬁlters to
enhance the separation among multiple RGB sequences.

In this paper, we focus our attention on the GC M3
(NGC 5272). M3 is a northern, metal-poor GC, with a metal-
licity of about [Fe/H]≃ −1.5 dex (Harris 1996, 2010 edi-
tion), which shows evidence of variation in Na, O, Mg and Al
(Sneden et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2005; Cohen & Mel´endez 2005;
M´esz´aros et al. 2015). Moreover, the analysis of its HB morphol-
ogy performed in Dalessandro et al. (2013) by using HST photome-
try inferred an internal helium spread of ∆Y≃ 0.02. This result has
been recently qualitatively conﬁrmed by Valcarce et al. (2016) us-
ing Str¨omgren photometry. Until now, no high-precision photomet-
ric studies have been dedicated to the search and analysis of multi-
ple populations in this cluster. Only a rough evidence for an anoma-
lous spread of its RGB colour distribution was found by Lardo et al.
(2011) using Sloan photometry, while Piotto et al. (2015) simply
showed the existence of a double RGB in the cluster CMD coming
from the HST UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GC, postponing the
analysis to future papers. For these reasons we exploited deep im-
ages taken with Str¨omgren uvby ﬁlters to provide a complete study
of the multiple generations of stars in M3 and complemented it with
the analysis of high-resolution spectra. Str¨omgren photometry for
M3 has been already used by Grundahl et al. (1999). However, this
photometry is not publicly available and has furthermore been ac-
quired on a small ﬁeld of view (3.8 × 3.8 arcmin2, with the NOT).
Our study covers a much larger ﬁeld of view and we will make the
catalogue available through the CDS2.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect.2 we provide all the
details on the photometric dataset and its reduction, while in Sect.3
we present the results coming from such an analysis. In Sect.4 the
complementary spectroscopic analysis is described and the results

2 PHOTOMETRIC DATA AND ANALYSIS

The photometric dataset analysed in this work consists of a
large sample of archival images obtained with the Isaac New-
ton Telescope - Wide Field Camera (INT-WFC) in medium-band
Str¨omgren ﬁlters. The INT-WFC detector consists of four chips,
with a pixel scale of 0.33 ′′ pixel−1. Each chip covers an area of
23.1′ × 12.1′ and they describe a structured ﬁeld of view where
intra-chip gaps are about 1′ wide, as shown in Fig.1.

The retrieved archival observations belong to different
datasets and cover several nights, from the 22nd of March 2001
to the 9th of May 2006. During these nights several dithered ex-
posures of M3 have been taken in the u, v, b, y Str¨omgren ﬁlters.
Tab.1 summarises the entire dataset, listing the ﬁlters used, expo-
sure times and the total number of exposures analysed.

The pre-reduction of the raw images has been performed by
means of standard procedures and the use of the IRAF3 package,
treating each chip of each exposure separately. For each chip and
ﬁlter, we retrieved from the Isaac Newton Group-ING archive 25
bias and 20 ﬂat-ﬁeld frames per ﬁlter, observed during the analysed
observing runs. We used these samples to compute 3 sigma-clipped
median bias and ﬂat-ﬁeld images by means of the zerocombine
and f latcombine IRAF tasks. The ﬁnal scientiﬁc images have
been obtained using the ccdproc IRAF task.

The photometric reduction has been performed by means of
DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR (Stetson 1987) and reﬁned using ALL-
FRAME (Stetson 1994). In the latter step we used as input for ALL-
FRAME a catalogue of all the sources found in at least three b-band
images, since they were those with the larger number of detections.
After these steps, for each chip and ﬁlter we built a catalogue by
requiring that each star fell in at least two of the reduced single ex-
posures. Since for each ﬁlter at least two short exposures exist, this
choice allowed us to always recover also the brightest stars that sat-
urate in the long exposures. We built a multi-wavelength catalogue

for each chip by matching the single-ﬁlter catalogues and includ-
ing all the stars with at least two measured Str¨omgren magnitudes.
Finally, for each single-chip catalogue we transformed stellar po-
sitions onto the 2MASS astrometric system (Skrutskie et al. 2006)
by using the CataPack software written by P. Montegriffo4 and af-
ter calibrating their magnitudes we merged them together to build
the ﬁnal catalogue. The calibration onto the Str¨omgren system has
been achieved using ten standard stars observed during the night of
the 22nd of March 2001. Their calibrated magnitudes in the uvby
ﬁlters have been taken from the catalogue of Paunzen (2015).

The spatial distribution of the sources that we recovered
through our photometric analysis is shown in Fig.1, where all the
stars are plotted as black dots. The centre of the cluster (RA0 =
13:42:11.38, Dec0 = +28:22:39.1 from Miocchi et al. 2013) is
marked as reference with a red cross, while the red circle describes
the cluster half-mass radius (rhm ∼ 167′′, see Miocchi et al. 2013).
The aim of our work is to study the multiple stellar genera-
tions of M3. This requires high precision in terms of photomet-
ric uncertainties. All the photometric standards have been observed
only with the central chip 4 of the INT camera, and since only few
stars are in common among the adjacent chips, we decided to focus
the following analysis only on chip 4 itself. In this way, the un-
certainties coming from the calibration procedure among the four
chips are avoided, and the covered ﬁeld of view (see the red box in
Fig.1) is still sufﬁciently large to grant a good statistic in terms of
detection. In fact, within the central chip fall 17155 sources, which
correspond to the 79% of the whole sample of sources detected
considering the entire camera. Moreover, the selected chip samples
the central regions of M3 out to ∼ 760 ′′, that is more than 4.5
times the cluster rhm.

3 STR ¨OMGREN CMDS

The four panels of Fig.2 show the behaviour of the photometric
errors σ, deﬁned as the standard deviation of each star magnitude
around the mean of the single-exposure measurements, as a func-
tion of the observed magnitudes. The scale of the plots has been
kept ﬁxed in order to show that in all ﬁlters, magnitudes brighter
than the Main Sequence Turn Off (MS-TO, marked in the Figure
with red arrows) have internal uncertainties smaller than 0.03 mag,
the only exception being the u-band, where the median error at the
MS-TO level is 0.05 mag. The (y, b − y) CMD of M3 is shown in
the left panel of Fig.3. All the evolutionary sequences appear to be
very well deﬁned, from a few magnitudes below the MS-TO to the
RGB-tip, where stars saturate at y < 12.7 mag. The same features
are clearly visible in the (y, v − y) CMD (right panel of Fig.3),
which covers a much wider colour baseline. A qualitative compar-
ison with photometry presented in Grundahl et al. (1999) reveals
no signiﬁcant differences both in terms or the RGB extent and HB
morphology.

As shown in several previous works, a proper combination of
Str¨omgren ﬁlters can unveil the presence of chemical anomalies
in GC stellar populations. The index m1 (deﬁned as m1 =(v −
b)−(b − y), Richter, Hilker, & Richtler 1999) is sensible to the
cluster metallicity. Left panel of Fig.4 shows the (y, m1) CMD
of M3. In this case, the spread of such index is σm1 = 0.06
mag at 16 < y < 16.5, consistent with the photometric errors
in this magnitude range and thus suggesting that M3 is homoge-
neous in terms of global metallicity. On the other hand, the index
δ4 =(u − v)−(b − y) (Carretta et al. 2011b) is able to reveal the
presence of chemical anomalies in the light element abundances
of all the GCs studied so far, regardless of their global metal con-
tent. The right panel of Fig.4 shows the cluster (y, δ4) CMD. The
spread of δ4 at the same magnitude interval as before is σd4 = 0.08
mag, larger than σm1. Since such a value cannot be ascribed to

to N but insensitive to temperature, and which has been exten-
sively used to distinguish between ﬁrst generation (FG) and sec-
ond generation (SG) stars, being well correlated with Na abun-
dances (see e.g. Carretta et al. 2009a). An extensive theoretical
study on the inﬂuence of the typical chemical anomalies observed
in GCs on the behaviour of stellar sequences in Str¨omgren CMDs
has been presented in Sbordone et al. (2011), while Carretta et al.
(2011b) approached the problem from the observational side. Ac-
cording to both theoretical and observational ﬁndings (see Fig.13
in Carretta et al. 2011b to see the expected differences for stars
N-rich and N-poor in different evolutionary phases and of differ-
ent metallicity), cy appears to be the most efﬁcient index to study
the multiple populations in M3 (which has a metallicity of about
[Fe/H]∼ −1.5 dex).

Fig.5 shows the (y,cy) CMD, obtained after excluding all the
sources with a sharpness parameter (deﬁned by DAOPHOT as a
shape-parameter whose value is zero for perfectly round and point-
like sources as expected for stars) | sh |> 0.2. They are also shown
as grey dots in Fig.2.

As immediately evident, in this combination of ﬁlters the
RGB of M3 splits in two separated sequences. The inset high-
lights the colour distribution of RGB stars in the magnitude range
15.3 < y < 17, where the separation appears clearer. Such a dis-
tribution clearly displays two peaks, separated by about 0.05 mag.
According to Carretta et al. (2011b), the left sequence should be
populated by N-poor, Na-poor FG stars, while the right sequence
by N-rich, Na-rich SG stars. Looking at their Figs. 1 and 2, we
note that such a clear bimodal distribution seems rather unusual.
The only case resembling M3 is NGC 288, a slightly metal-richer
and less massive GC. While the different level of N is demon-
strated by photometry, we will come back on Na in Sections 4
and 5. To test the statistical signiﬁcance of this bimodality, we per-
formed a GMM test (Muratov & Gnedin 2010), which conﬁrmed
that the unimodal hypothesis has to be rejected with a probabil-
ity larger than 99.99%. Such a result is conﬁrmed independently

larger photometric errors coming from the introduction of the u-
band (that at the RGB level has uncertainties very similar to those
measured for the other bands, see Fig.2) in the index, we interpret
it as suggestive of an intrinsic spread.

Anthony-Twarog, Twarog, & Craig (1995) used the index
c1 =(u − v)−(v − b), which is sensible to the strength of CN
and CH bands. This colour index has been subsequently used for
example by Grundahl, VandenBerg, & Andersen (1998) to study
the chemical anomalies in the stellar population of M13 or by
Yong et al. (2008) for NGC 6752. The last authors also deﬁned
another index called cy =(c1)−(b − y), which is still sensitive

also by a dip-test. The GMM test also gives as output the prob-
ability for each star to belong to one of the two components. We
assigned each star to FG or SG (blue and red dots in Figure 6, re-
spectively) according to their membership probability. In this way
the right component accounts for 309 stars, that is the 52 ± 3%,
while the left component is made up of 283 stars, corresponding
to the 48 ± 3%. Such an equal (within the uncertainty) distribution
between FG and SG is quite rare among Galactic GCs and to date it
has been observed only in NGC 6362 (see Dalessandro et al. 2014)
and NGC 288 (Carretta et al. 2011b) for which however there is
some discrepancy between population ratios based on photometry
and on spectroscopy (Carretta et al. 2009a). Also NGC 2808 has an
almost equal fraction of FG and SG stars, but this cluster presents
more extreme behaviour and has recently been attributed no less
than ﬁve separate populations (Milone et al. 2015; Carretta 2015).

3.1 Radial distribution

The radial distribution of multiple populations in GCs pro-
vides important information regarding their origin and formation
(Vesperini et al. 2013; Dalessandro et al. 2014; Larsen et al. 2015).
According to the theoretical scenarios proposed so far, the second
population(s) formed from the polluting material ejected by the pri-
mordial one should form in the central regions of a GC, thus ap-
pearing more centrally concentrated (see e.g. Decressin et al. 2007;
D’Ercole et al. 2008; Bastian, Cabrera-Ziri, & Salaris 2015b). So
far, most of the observations (e.g. Carretta et al. 2009b; Lardo et al.
2011; Beccari et al. 2013) have conﬁrmed this prediction. Few
notable exceptions have been recently found, such as NGC6362
(Dalessandro et al. 2014) and NGC6121 (Nardiello et al. 2015),
which do not show signiﬁcant radial differences at any distance
from the cluster centres. This observational evidence can be in-
terpreted as the effect of an efﬁcient dynamical evolution possi-
bly connected with a signiﬁcant stellar mass loss (Vesperini et al.
2013; Dalessandro et al. 2014; Miholics, Webb, & Sills 2015). An-
other unique case so far is represented by M15 (Larsen et al. 2015),
in which FG stars appear to be more centrally concentrated than
SG ones. The authors suggest that this is due to peculiar initial con-
ditions, however alternative explanations have been recently pro-
posed (Henault-Brunet 2015).

To study the radial distribution of multiple populations in M3,
we focus on the RGB only. As a ﬁrst step, following the method
described in Frank et al. (2015), we decontaminated the samples
of FG and SG RGB stars described in Sect.3 using a proper se-
lection in the b − y, c1 and b − y, m1 planes. The insets of Fig.6
show the criteria adopted for such a selection. In the upper inset,
we excluded in the b − y, c1 all the sources with c1 < 0.2 mag
(see ´Arnad´ottir, Feltzing, & Lundstr¨om 2010), while in the lower
inset we kept only stars running parallel to the iso-metallicity line
of the cluster RGB (see Calamida et al. 2007), within ±3σ from
the best-ﬁtting line. After this procedure, 36 stars in the previously
described magnitude interval (15.3 <y< 17) were discarded, but
the SG-to-FG ratio remained unchanged.

At this point, in Fig.7 we plot the radial distributions of the
two decontaminated stellar generations. Overall, the trend observed
for the red sequence is different from the other, as demonstrated
by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test which gives a probability
P> 99.8% that the two distributions are not extracted from the
same population. However, at a closer look this overall trend can be
divided in three separated intervals. Within the innermost 95′′ (i.e.
∼ 0.6 cluster rhm , see Miocchi et al. 2013), the two radial distri-
butions appear very similar (the KS test gives a probability of being

selection criteria are shown in the two inset, where we followed the pre-

identical larger than 94%) and no gradient is found in the trend of
SG-to-FG ratio against distance from the cluster centre (see ﬁrst
two points at 0.2 and 0.6 rhm in the bottom panel of Fig.7). On the
other hand, outside ∼ 0.6 rhm, the FG stars become progressively
less concentrated but more numerous, and the relative number ratio
reaches a minimum at ∼ 2 rhm. At that point, the trend inverts and
the SG-to-FG ratio reaches a value similar to that observed in the
cluster central regions. The ﬁnal overall trend therefore describes a
bimodal behaviour and shows that the two populations are numeri-
cally similar only globally, but not locally.

This result demonstrates that it is crucial to cover the entire
extent or a signiﬁcant portion of a stellar cluster to properly study
the radial distribution of its multiple populations.

The SG-to-FG radial proﬁle of M3 has been previously stud-
ied also by Lardo et al. (2011) based on Sloan photometry. Their
sample did not cover the innermost regions of the cluster due to
stellar crowding, and their analysis starts at r> 100′′, where the two
distributions appear to agree with our ﬁndings. This peculiar bi-
modal proﬁle resembles very well the prediction of Vesperini et al.
(2013) for a cluster with an initially more concentrated SG and
which underwent intermediate dynamical evolution (see their Fig-
ure 7). In this particular case, the mixing of the two generations
has started in the innermost regions, where the relaxation time is
shorter due to the larger number of interacting stars, but has not
reached the entire cluster extent yet, as it happens in the most dy-
namically evolved clusters (see Dalessandro et al. 2014). Such a
dynamical state is also independently conﬁrmed by the radial dis-
tribution of Blue Straggler Stars, that in the dynamical clock frame-
work described by Ferraro et al. (2012) places this cluster among
their Family-II sample (i.e. systems with intermediate dynamical
age).

4 SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS

By using Str¨omgren photometry we have been able to separate two
stellar populations in the cluster M3. As already demonstrated in
previous works (Carretta et al. 2011b; Sbordone et al. 2011), such
a photometric feature indicates that the two populations are char-
acterized by different chemical abundances, in terms of light el-
ements. However, photometry can only give qualitative results in
this respect. In order to quantitatively measure the difference in the
light element abundances for the two populations we need spec-
troscopy. Several previous works in the literature studied the chem-
istry of M3 stars. Therefore we looked for any spectroscopic target
with previously measured abundances that has a counterpart in our
photometric catalogue, and placed it on our CMD to test our ﬁnd-

We retrieved data published by Sneden et al. (2004) and
Cohen & Mel´endez (2005), but their targets are too bright and they
either saturate or are non-linear in our photometry. From the list
of Johnson et al. (2005), we found 27 targets that in our photome-
try are below the non-linearity limit (y= 14.1 mag, anyway fainter
than this value the sequences start to mix together) and divided this
sample into FG, Na-poor and SG, Na-rich stars depending on their
Na abundance with respect to the median5 [Na/Fe]med = −0.07
dex. Johnson et al. (2005) demonstrate that M3 shows not only the
common Na-O anti-correlation, but also that involving Mg and Al,
which is not observed in all clusters and tends to be more evi-
dent in metal-poor and/or massive GCs (e.g. Carretta et al. 2009b;
Cordero et al. 2015). For this reason, we exploited the recently pub-
lished results of M´esz´aros et al. (2015), where the authors mea-

5 This is not what Carretta et al. (2009a,b, 2010b) did. They based the sep-
aration between FG and SG on the minimum Na values in their samples of
RGB stars, increased by 4 times the uncertainty on Na. However, the sam-
ples of stars we are using in the present paper are smaller and the adoption
of a median value looks more robust.

sured [Al/Fe] abundances, and following the same selection cri-
terium we divided their sample into FG, Al-poor and SG, Al-rich
stars, depending on each target Al abundance with respect to the
median [Al/Fe]med = 0.02 dex. The result of these selection is
shown with triangles (Johnson’s targets) and squares (M´esz´aros’
targets) in Fig.8. Blue symbols represent FG targets, while red
symbols show SG ones. RGB stars are marked with ﬁlled sym-
bols, while empty symbols highlight likely AGB and HB stars. The
spectroscopic separation nicely follows that achieved through pho-
tometry. However, despite the good agreement, these targets do not
sample the magnitude interval where the photometric separation is
more neat. Concerned by this fact, we looked for other targets that
could ﬁll such a lack.

We used spectra acquired for a project on RR Lyrae stars in
M3 with the multi-object spectrograph FLAMES (Pasquini et al.
2002) at the ESO-VLT (programme 093.D-0536, PI: Contreras
Ramos), in a series of 7 exposures of ∼ 45 min each with the HR12
setup (5821 - 6146 ˚A, R = 18700), which contains the Na D lines.
Since our aim is to spectroscopically conﬁrm whether the two RGB
sequences we detected in the CMD of M3 correspond to FG and
SG, respectively, we selected only the 17 spectra of the dataset be-
longing to RGB targets. Since these stars were observed as compar-
ison for HB stars, their magnitude is fainter than for the literature
samples and covers the region where the photometric separation is
more evident. The data reduction was performed using the dedi-
cated ESO pipeline which includes bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding,
wavelength calibration, and spectrum extraction. Individual stellar
spectra have been cleaned from sky contribution by subtracting the
corresponding median sky spectrum. Finally, multiple spectra of
each target have been co-added, reaching a signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratio per pixel at about 6000 ˚A of ∼ 50 in the faintest stars and up
to 80 in the brightest ones.

After the pre-reduction, we ﬁrst measured the radial veloc-
ities (vr) of each target to determine their membership to the
cluster. Radial velocities have been obtained by using DAOSPEC
(Stetson & Pancino 2008) and by measuring the position of 34 lines
distributed along the whole spectral range covered by the HR12.
The uncertainties have been computed as the dispersion of the ve-
locities measured from each line divided by the square root of
the number of lines used, and they turned out to be smaller than
0.4 km s−1. The heliocentric corrections have been computed with
the IRAF task RVCORRECT. All the vr measurements and their
uncertainties are summarised in Table 2. The mean velocity of
the sample turned out to be vr = −148.8 km s−1 (σv = 3.4
km s−1), in very good agreement with previous estimates (e.g.
vr = −147.6 km s−1, Harris 1996). Since all of the target ve-
locities lie within ±3σv from the mean velocity of the cluster
(even if we adopt a more robust estimate of σv = 5.6 km s−1,
see McLaughlin & van der Marel 2005) we considered them all as
cluster members.

Effective temperatures (Tef f ) and gravities (log g) have been
determined photometrically. Since not all of our targets have a
counterpart in the Str¨omgren photometric catalogue (three are
missing, see Tab.2), to determine the atmospheric parameters we
projected the location of each target in the optical (V, V-I) CMD
onto a reference isochrone. This CMD is built from two separated
catalogues. One comes from the publicly available HST photome-
try of Sarajedini et al. 2007 and samples the innermost regions of
the cluster, while the other comes from archival MegaCam obser-
vations and samples the outer regions. We selected as isochrone
an α-enhanced model with age of 12 Gyr, Z= 0.001 (correspond-
ing to [Fe/H]≃ −1.6 dex) and standard helium composition re-

trieved from the BaSTI archive (Pietrinferni et al. 2006) and we
placed it onto the CMD assuming distance modulus and redden-
ing by Ferraro et al. (1999). The errors associated to these parame-
ters have been computed as described in Massari et al. (2014b), by
taking into account the uncertainties on the projection arising from
distance modulus (σDM = 0.1 mag), reddening (σE(B−V ) = 0.05
mag) and photometry (σV = σI = 0.02 mag). They turned out to
be of the order of ∼ 70 K for Tef f and 0.1 dex for log g. Unfortu-
nately, for four targets of our sample we were not able to determine
a photometric counterpart, and they have been therefore excluded
from the analysis.

The atmospheric parameters were derived by using photomet-
ric informations because the limited wavelength range covered by
the HR12 does not allow us to use a sufﬁciently large number of FeI
and FeII lines in order to use the fully spectroscopic approach based
on the excitation/ionization balance. We used the code GALA6
(Mucciarelli et al. 2013) to determine the microturbulent velocity
(vturb) by requiring that no trend exists between iron abundances
and line strengths of the lines used, while the photometric temper-
atures and gravities have been kept ﬁxed during the analysis. For
the microturbulent velocity we obtained an average uncertainty of
about 0.2 km s−1 . The atmospheric parameters of the analysed tar-
gets are listed in Table 2.

4.1 Elemental abundances

The abundances of iron have been computed by using GALA. The
EW and the error of each line were obtained using DAOSPEC, iter-
atively launched by means of the 4DAO7 code (Mucciarelli 2013).
The lines considered in the analysis have been selected from suit-
able synthetic spectra at the FLAMES resolution and computed
with the SYNTHE package (Sbordone et al. 2004) by using the
average parameters estimated from photometry and the metallic-
ity derived by Carretta et al. (2009a). The model atmospheres have
been computed with the ATLAS98 code (Castelli & Kurucz 2004).
We adopted the atomic and molecular data from the last release of
the Kurucz/Castelli compilation9 and selected only the lines pre-
dicted to be unblended. The ﬁnal iron abundances of the targets
have been computed as the average of each single line measure-
ment, by rejecting all the lines with an EW uncertainty larger than
20%. The errors have been computed by dividing the line-to-line
dispersion by the square root of the number of lines used. The av-
erage iron abundance for the whole sample of 17 giants is [Fe/H]=
−1.40 dex (σ = 0.09 dex). Such a value is in good agreement with
previous estimates like Carretta et al. 2009a or Cavallo & Nagar
2000, which quote [Fe/H]≃ −1.5 dex, and in excellent agree-
ment with M´esz´aros et al. (2015), who found [Fe/H]= −1.40 dex
(σ = 0.08 dex).

Abundances of NaI have been derived with the spectral syn-
thesis technique performed by using the package SALVADOR
(Mucciarelli et al., in prep) from the lines at 5886 and 5892˚A. The
corresponding internal uncertainties have been computed by means
of Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we added Poissonian
noise to the best-ﬁt synthetic spectrum to reproduce the observed
SNR and then we repeated the analysis. After 1000 Monte Carlo
realizations, the dispersion of the measurements around the mean

value has been adopted as the internal abundance uncertainty. In or-
der to take into account Non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium
(NLTE) effects the abundances derived from the NaI lines have
been corrected according to Lind et al. (2011b). The adopted solar
reference value have been taken from Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
The ﬁnal values together with the related uncertainties are listed in
Table 2.

5 RESULTS

Fig.9 shows the numerical distributions of [Na/Fe] with (upper
panel) and without (lower panel) correction for NLTE effects.
Their dispersions are σLT E
[Na/F e] =
0.24 dex, respectively. These values agree well with the ﬁnding
by Johnson et al. (2005), who found σLT E
[Na/F e] = 0.25 dex and
σNLT E
[Na/F e] = 0.26 dex for a larger sample of 77 stars.

[Na/F e] = 0.19 dex and σNLT E

The two distributions do not show a clear-cut bimodality, but
only a hint of a separation in two groups. For these reason, we
decided to assume the median values of the two distributions to
split the sample in Na-poor (FG) and Na-rich (SG) stars, as done
for the stars retrieved from the sample of M´esz´aros et al. (2015).
Median values are shown in Fig.9 with vertical red dashed lines.
We cross-correlated the spectroscopic targets with our photometric
catalogue, ﬁnding 14 matches (targets IDs, coordinates and mag-
nitudes are listed in Tab.2, where IDspec corresponds to that used
in the spectroscopic archive and IDphot to that used in our photo-
metric catalogue.). Their location in the Str¨omgren (y, cy) CMD is
shown with ﬁlled blue (FG) and red (SG) circles in Fig.8.

The position of the targets follows quite well the bimodality of

the RGB detected photometrically, with all the Na-rich stars located
on the right RGB, and the majority of Na-poor stars distributed
along the left RGB, with only few outliers.

In order to highlight the nice separation of all the spectro-
scopic FG and SG targets, we show their colour distribution in
the inset of the Figure. Two main peaks appear to be very well
deﬁned, and this appearance is conﬁrmed by both the GMM test
and the dip-test, which conﬁrm the bimodality of the distribution
with a statistical signiﬁcance larger than 99.9%. A further conﬁr-
mation of the good correspondence between our photometric and
spectroscopic results comes from the number-ratio of the two pop-
ulations. In fact, from our spectroscopic sample we found that FG
and SG are equal in number within the Poissonian uncertainty, with
the FG accounting for the 56 ± 8% against the 44 ± 11% of SG
stars. This result is in good agreement with our photometric esti-
mate (48 ± 3% of FG and 52 ± 3% of SG members, see Sect.3).
It is also worth noticing that among the 12 AGB targets found in
the literature samples, the number ratio of the two population is
signiﬁcantly different from that measured in our sample along the
RGB. In fact, nine stars appear to belong to the FG and the re-
maining three to the SG, this leading to a 75%-25% ratio. Such a
ﬁnding is interesting because it represents one of the few measure-
ment in the disputed topic concerning the behaviour of GC multi-
ple generations along the AGB. In fact, recently a few metal-poor
GCs were found to show no SG-AGB stars at all. This is the case
for NGC 6752 (Campbell et al. 2013) and for M62 (Lapenna et al.
2015), though in the latter case the lack of SG-AGB stars is possi-
bly due to the small sample of studied stars. However, in several
other cases (Johnson et al. 2015b; Garc´ıa-Hern´andez et al. 2015)
SG-AGB stars have indeed been detected. M3 belongs to the sec-
ond of these groups, since Garc´ıa-Hern´andez et al. (2015) already
found three SG-AGB stars using APOGEE spectra. In this work we
conﬁrm this ﬁnding and we add other three of such rare targets.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we exploited a ground based photometric dataset in
Str¨omgren uvby ﬁlters to study the multiple stellar generations of
the GC M3. The analysis of the CMD built with the cy index has
shown the presence of a double RGB, equally populated in its two
components. The radial distributions of the two populations turned
out to be quite peculiar, with red and blue sequence being com-
pletely mixed up to about the half-mass radius, then changing the
observed trend with the red component staying more centrally con-
centrated out to about ∼ 3.5 rhm, when the two mix again. Such
a trend is predicted to be observed in clusters which experienced
moderate dynamical evolution, and it conﬁrms previous dynamical
age estimate available in literature.

The spectroscopic analysis of a sample of 17 giants observed
with FLAMES, and the comparison with previous abundance mea-
surements available in literature, demonstrated that the photometric
detection of the two RGBs ﬂags the presence of chemically distinct
populations with the FG corresponding to the left sequence and the
SG to the right, as observed in all the other metal-poor and metal-
intermediate clusters studied so far with the Str¨omgren cy index.
We also found three new SG-AGB stars, thus conﬁrming that the
lack of such stars observed in other metal-poor GCs is not an ubiq-
uitous feature.

Our work therefore demonstrates yet again how efﬁcient
Str¨omgren photometry is to study the phenomenon of multiple stel-
lar generations in GCs over the large ﬁeld of view and the large
number of samples stars permitted by ground-based photometric
observations and how important is to couple spectroscopic and pho-
tometric information to characterise globular cluster populations.
