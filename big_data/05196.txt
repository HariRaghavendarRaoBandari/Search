Abstract: We determine (p, q)−string and (p, q)−ﬁve brane solutions of type IIB su-
pergravity using SL(2, Z)−symmetry of the full type IIB superstring theory. We also
determine SL(2, Z)−transformed solution corresponding to the bound state of NS5-branes
and fundamental strings. Then we analyze its near horizon limit and we show that it leads
to the AdS3 × S3 with mixed ﬂuxes.

It is conjectured that the type IIB superstring theory possesses SL(2, Z) non-perturbative
duality. The ﬁrst evidence follows from the manifestly SL(2, R)−invariance of type IIB su-
pergravity eﬀective action [1, 2] for recent excellent review see [3]. Further evidence follows
from the spectrum of non-perturbative objects that are presented in type IIB theory:Dp-
branes with p = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 [4], fundamental string and NS5-brane 1. It was argued that
under S-duality fundamental string maps to D1-brane, D5-brane maps to NS5-brane and so
on. On the other hand we know that macroscopic extend objects are sources of supergrav-
ity ﬁelds and hence it is possible to ﬁnd corresponding background solutions that solve the
supergravity equations of motions. Well known examples of such solutions are fundamental
string solution [9] or NS5-brane solution [10]. Then with the help of the SL(2, R)-covariance
of type IIB supergravity action new solutions corresponding to (p, q)−string was found in
[7]. In fact, an existence of this solution serves as a further evidence of SL(2, Z)−duality
of type IIB string theory. The main idea of this construction is to start with fundamental
string solution and performs SL(2, R) rotation. Then the requirement that the resulting
conﬁguration has to have integer charge in some units ﬁxes entries of this matrix as func-
tions of these charges and asymptotic values of dilaton and Ramond-Ramond one form.
It is important to stress that this solution depends on one harmonic function with mani-
festly SL(2, R)−covariant coeﬃcient. Then this method was applied for the construction
of (p, q)−ﬁve brane backgrounds in [17]. These very interesting backgrounds were analyzed
recently from the (m, n)−string probe point of view in [8] and it was shown that when we

perform SL(2, R) rotation that maps the macroscopic (p, q)−string background to the fun-
damental string background the probe string does not transform in the expected way since
now it carries non-integer charge with respect to NSNS two form. The same situation also
occurs in case of (p, q)−ﬁve brane background. It was suggested there that the resolution
of this puzzle could be found when we consider a full type IIB superstring theory that is
invariant under SL(2, Z)−subgroup of SL(2, R). This paper is devoted to this analysis.

We propose that it is natural to search for the (p, q)−macroscopic string solution
with the presence of the source which is manifestly SL(2, R) covariant (p, q)−string action
[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However the fact that there is no fractional string or D-brane charges
demands that the proper invariant group of type superstring theory is SL(2, Z) rather than
SL(2, R) group and this group should be used for the construction of (p, q)−macroscopic
string and ﬁve brane solutions 2. With the help of this argument we will be able to
ﬁnd supergravity solutions corresponding to (p, q)−macroscopic string and ﬁve branes that
have correct NSNS and RR charges and where the (m, n)−string probe has an expected
properties. We show that these solutions depend on two harmonic functions which is
diﬀerent from the solutions found in [7, 17] which however reﬂects the fact that (p, q)−string
can be considered as the bound state of p−fundamental string and q−D1-branes even if
this bound state is not threshold and hence harmonic superposition rules cannot be applied
for it [23].

As the next step we extend this analysis to the case of NS5-brane whose supergravity
solution has been known for a long time [10]. We perform SL(2, Z) transformation of
this solution and ﬁnd new solution corresponding to (d,−b)-ﬁve brane. This solution
is characterized by two harmonic functions whose parameters depend on the charges of
(d,−b)−ﬁve brane and on the asymptotic values of moduli. We also analyze (m, n)−string
probe in this background and we show that it is equivalent to the dynamics of (m′, n′)-
string in original NS5-brane background where m′, n′ are integers that again explain the
puzzle found in [8].

Finally we consider SL(2, Z) transformed solution of the a bound state of Q5 NS5-
branes wrapped on four torus and Q1 fundamental strings that are smeared over this four
torus [11]. We ﬁnd solution that is characterized by four harmonic functions that depend
on the moduli of this solution and charges with respect to RR and NSNS two forms.
This solution has also an interesting near horizon limit which is AdS3 × S3 with mixed
three form ﬂuxes with integer charges.
Integrability of superstring in this background
was studied recently in [28]. The main idea of this paper is to start with the pure RR
background when the new WZ term that represents the coupling to the NSNS ﬂux is
added. Using this construction many new interesting results were derived [29, 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, 35]. It is important to stress that in all these works the value of NSNS ﬂux can
be interpreted as the deformation parameter that takes any real value from the interval
(0, 1). This is perfectly consistent from the point of view of perturbative string theory
since classical string does not couple to the dilaton. On the other hand this approximation

2Even if ﬁve brane solutions are source free we can consider solutions where the source is covariant
(p, q)−ﬁve brane action [22] that electrically couples to doublets of six forms that are dual to NSNS and
RR two forms.

certainly breaks down when we consider D1-brane in this background that couples to the
dilaton through Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
In order to analyze D1-brane in the AdS3 ×
S3 with mixed three form ﬂuxes we have to have background with explicit values od
dilaton and RR zero form too. It is natural to presume that such a background arises as
the near horizon limit of the SL(2, Z)−transformed solution corresponding to the bound
state of NS-ﬁve branes and fundamental strings. We show that this is really true. More
explicitly, we show that SL(2, Z)-transformation and near horizon limit commutes which
is a generalization of the commutativity of S-duality and near horizon limit found in [14].
Then we study (m, n)−string in AdS3 × S3 background with mixed three form ﬂuxes and
using the fact that the near horizon limit and SL(2, Z)−transformation commutes we can
map this (m, n)−string to the (m′, n′)−string in AdS3 × S3 background with NSNS two
form ﬂux. We show that for the special value of (m, n) charges the (m, n)−string in the
AdS3×S3 background is equivalent to the fundamental string in AdS3×S3 background with
NSNS three form ﬂux that can be described by standard CFT techniques [12, 14, 15, 16].
Of course, this result does not solve the problem of the analysis of fundamental string in
AdS3× S3 with mixed ﬂuxes which is very complicated and deserves very special treatment
[36].

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section (2) we review the basic fact
about type IIB low energy eﬀective theory and suggest the main idea how to derive

SL(2, Z)−transformed solutions of type IIB supergravity equations of motion.
tion (3) we apply this procedure to the case of (p, q)−string background. In section (4)
we perform the same analysis in case of (p, q)−ﬁve brane background and we extend this
analysis to the bound state of NS5-branes and fundamental strings in section (5). In sec-
tion (6) we take the near horizon limit of this solution and analyze its properties. Finally
in conclusion (7) we outline our results and suggest possible extension of this work.

2. SL(2, Z) Covariance of Type IIB String Theory

In this section we review the basic facts about bosonic content of the type IIB low energy
eﬀective action and we present general idea how to ﬁnd SL(2, Z) transformed solution.

The type IIB theory has two three-form ﬁeld strengths H = dB, F = dC (2), where H
corresponds to NSNS three form while F belongs to RR sector and does not couple to the
usual string world-sheet. Type IIB theory has also two scalar ﬁelds that can be combined
into a complex ﬁeld τ = χ + ie−Φ. The dilaton Φ is in the NSNS sector while χ belongs to
the RR sector. The other bose ﬁelds are the metric gM N in Einstein frame and self-dual
ﬁve form ﬁeld strength F5. However this ﬁeld can be consistently set to zero for solutions
that we study in this paper and hence we do not include it to the action. Then it is possible
to write down SL(2, R) covariant form of the bosonic part of type IIB eﬀective action

Let us now introduce an action for (m, n)−string that couples electrically to NSNS and
RR two form and hence can be considered as a source for corresponding ﬁelds. The action
for (m, n)-string has the form 3

S(p,q) = −TD1Z dτ dσ(√mTM−1mq−detgM N ∂αxM ∂βxN +

+ TD1Z dτ dσmT BM N ∂τ xM ∂σxN , m =  m

(2.6)

where TD1 = 1
condition that m transforms as

2πα′ . The action (2.6) is invariant under global transformations (2.4) on

ˆm = Λm .

(2.7)

In this notation m counts the number of fundamental strings while n counts the number
of D1-branes and hence they have to be integer. This fact implies that Λ ∈ SL(2, Z). In
other words SL(2, R) invariance of type IIB low energy eﬀective action is broken to its
SL(2, Z) subgroup due to the charge quantization condition. As a consequence the action
that includes both type IIB eﬀective action and string probe action

S = SIIB + S(p,q)

(2.8)

is invariant under SL(2, Z) group rather than under SL(2, R) group. This fact will have a
crucial consequence for the construction of (p, q)− string and ﬁve brane solutions.

Using this basic presumption we now present the main idea how to derive supergravity

solution with (p, q)−fundamental string as a source. Observe that we can write

  p
q! =  p b

q d!  1

0! ⇒ m(p, q) = Λ(p, q)mF , pd − bq = 1

˜B = ΛT (p, q)B(p, q) .

(2.11)

Then with the manifest SL(2, R) invariance of the Type IIB eﬀective action we ﬁnd that
it has the form

so that ˜M and ˜B have the same functional form as corresponding ﬁelds in case of fun-
damental string as the source so that we denote its value with superscript F and omit
tilde over them.
In other words we ﬁnd following components of M(p, q) and B(p, q)
corresponding to the (p, q)−string as a source:

M(p, q) = Λ(p, q)MF ΛT (p, q) , B(p, q) = (ΛT )−1(p, q)BF .

In this case the electric charge corresponding to this background has the form

In case of solitaire (p, q)−brane we can argue in the similar way with the diﬀerence
that this is a magnetic solution that is source free. Further, the charge transforms in the

element is expressed in string frame. We use the notation when small gM N corresponds to
the Einstein frame metric while GM N corresponds to the string frame metric. Note that
these two metrics are related by rescaling

gM N = e−Φ/2GM N .

(3.2)

Since gM N is invariant under SL(2, Z) transformation we derive relation between trans-
formed and original string frame metrics

ˆGM N = e

Now we are ready to ﬁnd solution that will be deﬁned as SL(2, Z) transformation of the

(3.7)

On the other hand the solution found above still depends on the string coupling gs of the
original solution and non-physical parameters b, d that appear in Λ. However we would like
to express the new solution using the assymptotic values of ˆΦ and ˆχ together with a and
c that correspond to qF
N S charges. In order to do this we take the limit r → ∞ in
e− ˆΦ and ˆχ given in (3.4) and we obtain

As a check note that for a = χ0 = 0 we obtain that ˆH = ˆH′ ≡ H(0,1) and hence

It is instructive to compare this solution with (a, c)-fundamental string solution found
in [7]. The main diﬀerence is that our solution depends on two harmonic functions as
opposite to the solution derived in [7]. In some way this is a reﬂection of the fact that
we have a bound state of D1-brane and fundamental string even if this superposition does
not correspond to the harmonic superposition rule [23] as this bound state is not marginal.
Further, the arguments of the harmonic functions are diﬀerent from the expression used
in [7] which however implies that our solution is deﬁned with the help of SL(2, Z) matrix
rather than SL(2, R) matrix that was used in [7]. As a consequence the solution (3.16)
behaves consistently from the probe (m, n)−string point of view. To see this explicitly let
us consider probe (m, n)−string in this background when the action has the form

S(m,n) = −TD1Z dτ dσ(pmT ˆM−1mq−detˆgM N ∂α ˆxM ∂β ˆxN +

+ TD1Z dτ dσmT ˆBM N ∂τ ˆxM ∂σ ˆxN ,

(3.17)

where ˆgM N is the Einstein frame metric in rescaled coordinates

ˆgM N =

gM N (ˆr) .

(3.18)

ˆgs
s (a − cχ0)2

pc2 + ˆg2

However due to the fact that the pullback of the Einstein metric and two forms is invariant
under rescaling by deﬁnition we can easily use the original variables x instead of ˆx. Then
the probe action has the form

S(m,n) = −TD1Z dτ dσ(pm′2 + n′2e−2ΦFq−detGF

+ TD1Z dτ dσm′BF

M N ∂αxM ∂βxN +

where

m′ =  m′

n′ ! =  dm − bn

−cm + an! .

(3.19)

(3.20)

From the previous action we see that the problem of the analysis of the dynamics of
(m, n)−string in (a, c)−string background is reduced to the analysis of (m′, n′)−string in
the fundamental string background where m′, n′ are evaluated at (3.20). The beautiful
analysis of this problem was performed in [24] and we will not reviewed it here. We also
see that for m = a, n = c we obtain that m′ = 1, n′ = 0 which is again consistent with the
picture of probe F-string in fundamental string background that is rotated by SL(2, Z)
transformation. In other words our solution solves the issue that was found in our previous
paper [8].

4. (d, −b)−Five Brane Solution
In this section we ﬁnd (d,−b)-ﬁve brane solution when we perform SL(2, Z) transformation
of NS5-brane supergravity solution. Recall that this solution has the form [10]

We will argue below that d and b are proportional to N SN S and RR magnetic charges of
ﬁve brane. For that reason we would like to express transformed solution as a function of
d, b together with the string coupling constant ˆgs and assymptotic values of ˆχ(0).

To begin with we note that the transformed line element has the form

dˆs2 =pc2 + d2g2

Now we observe that we can write

Now if we multiply the ﬁrst expression with d and use the fact that ad − bc = 1 we can
express c in terms of χ0, ˆgs, d, b as

c = ˆgsgs(dχ0 − b)

and consequently

gs =

which is in agreement with the general result (2.15). Finally we determine the space-time
dependence of the dilaton

RR = −bqN S5

(4.13)

Now we proceed to the analysis of the probe (m, n)−string in this background. In the same
way as in previous section we ﬁnd that the action has the form

S(m,n) = −TD1Z dτ dσ(pm′2 + n′2e−2ΦNS5q−detGN S5

+ TD1Z dτ dσm′BN S5

M N ∂τ xM ∂σxN ,

M N ∂αxM ∂βxN +

where

m′ =  d −b

−c a !  m

n ! =  dm − bn

−cm + an! .

(4.14)

(4.15)

As we could expect the (m, n)−action in (d,−b)−ﬁve brane background is equivalent to
the action of (m′, n′) string in the background of N S5−brane. The most interesting case
occurs for

m = a , n = c

(4.16)

– 10 –

that implies m′ = 1 , n′ = 0 and hence the action corresponds to the fundamental string
in NS5-brane action. In order to analyze main properties of this conﬁguration we consider
string stretched along x0, x1 directions, impose the static gauge x0 = τ, x1 = σ and ﬁnally
consider time dependent radial coordinate only. Then the induced metric has the form

gτ τ =

˙R2) ,

gσσ =

√gs

H−1/4 , ˙R =

and hence the action (4.14) has the form

S(a,c) = −

1

2πα′ Z dτ dσq1 − HN S5 ˙R2 .

(4.17)

(4.18)

From (4.18) we see that there is no potential for the fundamental string probe in the NS5-
brane background which nicely demonstrates the fact that fundamental string together with
NS5-brane background can form marginal bound state. Expressing in original variables
there is no potential for (a, c)-string in (d,−b)-ﬁve brane background when ad − bc = 1.

Another interesting case occurs for

m = b , n = d

(4.19)

that implies m′ = 0, n′ = 1.
In other words the dynamics of (b, d)−string in (d,−b)-
ﬁve brane background is equivalent to the motion of D1-brane in NS5-brane background.
The dynamics of this conﬁguration was analyzed in [25] and we will not repeat it here.
Finally note that the motion of the general (m′, n′)−string in NS5-brane background is
simple generalization of the case of the electriﬁed brane [26, 27]. Since this generalization
is trivial we will not repeat it here and recommend the original papers for more details.

5. SL(2, Z) Transformation of NS5-brane and F-String Bound State

In this section we perform SL(2, Z) transformation of the supergravity solution with Q1

6, . . . , 9 are identiﬁed with period 2πv1/4α′1/2. Note also that the fundamental strings are
smeared over this four torus.

– 11 –

and we again want to express f1 and f5 as functions of ˆgs and χ0 together with the numbers
that are proportional to the corresponding charges. If we proceed in the same way as in
previous two sections we ﬁnd

ˆf1 = 1 +

16π4α3ˆgsQ1

ˆFmnp = −2bQ5α′(ǫS3)mnp .

As the check of the validity of our solution let us consider S-duality transformation when
a = b = 0 and c = 1, b = −1 that also implies χ0 = 0. Then it is easy to see that the

We are mainly interested in the near horizon limit of the background speciﬁed by
the equations (5.11),(5.12), (5.13) and (5.14) since we expect that it leads to AdS3 × S3
background with mixed ﬂuxes. We do it in the next section.

6. Near Horizon Limit

We consider two ways how to perform the near horizon limit of SL(2, Z) transformed so-
lution of the bound state of N S−ﬁve branes and fundamental strings. In the ﬁrst case we
ﬁrstly take the near horizon limit and then perform the SL(2, Z) transformation. In the
second one we consider opposite situation when we ﬁrstly perform the SL(2, Z) transfor-
mation and then we take the near horizon limit. Finally we compare these two results.

In the ﬁrst case we start with the solution (5.1) and take its near horizon limit r ≪ r1,5

and we obtain the background in the form

ds2 =

r2
r2

(−dt2 + dx2

5) +

r2
r2 (dx2

1 + ··· + dx2

4) + (dx2

6 + ··· + dx2

9) .

Let us rescale the time and x5 coordinate as

r5
r1

dr = dˆt ,

r5
r1

dx5 = dˆx5

so that the line element has the form

ds2 =

r2

L2

while the dilaton is constant and equal to

e−2Φ =

Note that thanks to the rescaling we have

Hr05 = 2

so that the form H can be written using the volume element of AdS3 as

H =

2
L

ǫAdS3 , ǫAdS3 =pdetgAdS3 dr ∧ dˆt ∧ dˆx5 .

The ﬂux from the NS5-brane source has the form

H = 2L2ǫS3 .

Finally we introduce dimensionless coordinates on AdS3 in the following way

ˆt = L˜t ,

ˆx5 = L˜x5

so that ǫAdS3 = L3˜ǫAdS3 and hence we obtain the result

H = 2L2(˜ǫAdS3 + ǫS3)

Since the solution given above is a consistent solution of type IIB supergravity it is

possible to perform SL(2, Z) transformation of this solution. As a result we obtain

Let us now consider the case when we ﬁrstly perform SL(2, Z) duality transformation
and then take the near horizon limit. Explicitly, we begin with the SL(2, Z) transformed

we obtain

ˆH = 2dQ5α′(ǫ gAdS3

+ ǫS3) ,

ˆF = −2bQ5α′(ǫ gAdS3

that agree with ˜H and ˜F . In summary we showed an important result that the near horizon
limit and SL(2, Z) transformation commutes which implies that the AdS3×S3 background
with mixed ﬂuxes can be derived from AdS3 × S3 background through SL(2, Z) rotation.
We will now going to analyze consequences of this result for the dynamics of the probe
string in this background. Using the same arguments as in previous section we ﬁnd the
action in the form

S = −TD1Z dτ dσpm′2 + n′2e−2ΦNSq−det(GN S

To proceed further we use the fact that AdS3 × S3 is isomorphic to the group manifold
G = SU (1, 1) × SU (2). Explicitly, let g is the group element from G. Then it is possible
to write the metric (6.10) as

Our result shows that (a, c)−string in the (d,−b)−mixed ﬂux background has two holomor-
phic and anti-holomorphic currents and can be analyzed in the same way as WZW model
[37] using powerful conformal ﬁeld theory techniques. On the other hand it is important to
stress that (m, n)−string in (d,−b)−background is still classically integrable for any values
of m, n [35].

7. Conclusion

Let us outline results derived in this paper. We found type IIB supergravity solutions
corresponding to (p, q)−string and (p, q)−ﬁve brane backgrounds using SL(2, Z) covariance
of type IIB superstring theory. We showed that these solutions have the correct values of
charges and also that the probe (m, n)−string in this background can be mapped to the
(m′, n′)−string in the original fundamental or NS5-brane background where m′, n′ are
integers whose values are predicted by SL(2, Z) duality of type IIB superstring theory.
We also derived background that arises by SL(2, Z) transformation of the bound state of
Q5 NS5-branes and Q1 fundamental strings. Then we considered its near horizon limit
and argued that it leads to the AdS3 × S3 background with mixed three form ﬂuxes.
Then we analyzed (m, n)−string in given background and we argued that for m = a, n =
c the string equations of motion are equivalent to the conservation of two holomorphic
and antiholomorphic currents and hence this particular case can be analyzed using two
dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory. We mean that this is a very interesting result that
shows that (a, c)−string is natural probe of AdS3 × S3 background with (d,−b)−ﬂuxes.
It would be nice to analyze solutions of
(m, n)−string equations of motion in AdS3×S3 background with mixed ﬂuxes. background.
It would be also nice to analyze integrability of general (m, n)−string in this background in
more details using the manifest covariant form of (m, n)−string action. We hope to return
to these problems in future.

The extension of this work is as follows.
