ABSTRACT

We present a study of the optical properties of the 26 most massive galaxy clusters
selected within the SPT-SZ 2500 deg2 survey. This Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect selected
sample spans a redshift range of 0.10 < z < 1.13. We measure the galaxy radial
distribution, the luminosity function (LF), and the halo occupation number (HON)
using optical data with a typical depth of m∗ + 2 within the band that lies just
redward of the 4000 ˚A break at the cluster redshift. The stacked radial proﬁles are
consistent with a Navarro-Frenk-White proﬁle with a concentration of 2.84+0.40−0.37 for
the red sequence and 2.36+0.38−0.35 for the total population. Stacking the data in multiple
redshift bins shows a hint of redshift evolution in the concentration when both the
total population is used, and when only red sequence galaxies are used (at 2.05σ and
2.81σ, respectively). The stacked LF shows a faint end slope αall = −1.06+0.04−0.03 for the
total and αrs = −0.80+0.04−0.03 for the red sequence population. The redshift evolution of
the characteristic magnitude m∗ is found to be consistent with a passively evolving
Composite Stellar Population (CSP) model over the full redshift range. By adopting
the CSP model predictions for the characteristic magnitude m∗, we explore the redshift
evolution in the faint end slope α and characteristic galaxy density φ∗. We ﬁnd α for the
total population to be consistent with no evolution (0.29σ), while evidence of evolution
for the red galaxies is mildly signiﬁcant (1.08−2.10σ), with a steeper faint end at low
redshifts. The data show that the density φ∗/E2(z) of galaxies with characteristic
magnitude m∗ decreases with redshift, in tension with the self-similar expectation at
a 2.38σ level for the total population, when m∗ is ﬁxed to the model. The measured
HON–mass relation for our sample-wide redshift range has a lower normalization than
previous studies at low redshift. Finally, our data support HON redshift evolution at
a 2.11σ level, with clusters at higher redshift containing fewer galaxies per unit mass
to m∗ + 3 than their low-z counterparts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clusters have long been recognised as important laborato-
ries for the study of galaxy formation and evolution (e.g.,
Spitzer & Baade 1951; Dressler 1980; Butcher & Oemler
1984; De Propris et al. 2003; Andreon 2010). With the ad-
vent of the new generation of mm-wave survey telescopes
like the South Pole Telescope (Carlstrom et al. 2011), the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, Fowler et al. 2007)
and Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011b), it has be-
come possible to select galaxy clusters over large fractions of
the extragalactic sky using the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich
eﬀect (SZE), which arises from the inverse Compton scatter-
ing of CMB photons oﬀ the hot electrons in the intracluster
medium (Sunyaev & Zel’dovich 1972). For the SPT-SZ ar-
cminute angular resolution 2500 deg2 survey, it has been
demonstrated that the cluster samples selected using this
signature are close to mass limited (Reichardt et al. 2013),
extend to at least redshift z = 1.47 (Bayliss et al. 2014)
and have purity exceeding 95% from the SZE selection alone
(Song et al. 2012b; Bleem et al. 2015). These cluster samples,
selected using cluster gas signatures as opposed to cluster
galaxy signatures, are ideal for evolutionary studies of the
cluster galaxy populations.

By studying the evolution of the cluster galaxy lumi-
nosity function (LF) we can address the changes in the clus-
ter populations in a statistical manner. It has been shown,
that while the bright population is consistent with a passive
evolution of the stellar population, the faint-end of the red
sequence LF (rLF) becomes increasingly shallow at higher
redshifts (e.g De Lucia et al. 2007; Gilbank et al. 2008; Rud-
nick et al. 2009). Furthermore, the same studies hint at a
weak correlation of the luminosity function faint end slope
α with mass. At the same time, previous studies have shown
that the Halo Occupation Number (HON), or the integral
of the LF per unit mass, seems to be invariant with redshift
(Lin et al. 2004, 2006), which points to continuous galaxy
transformation within the cluster. This transformation can
also be tracked as a function of the radius, using the concen-
tration evolution of the diﬀerent species. Literature values
at diﬀerent redshifts seem to indicate no evolution when all
galaxies within the virial radius are considered (e.g., Carl-
berg et al. 1997; Capozzi et al. 2012), and while the expecta-
tion is that the brightest red sequence galaxies, which dom-
inate the bright-end of the LF, would be more concentrated
than the fainter component, it is not known whether this ef-
fect is present already at high redshift. All these components
are also used in the framework of the Halo Occupation Dis-
tribution (HOD; Berlind et al. 2003), which describes how
galaxies occupy the cluster as a function of the location,
velocity distribution, and luminosity.

In this work, we extract the radial distribution, lumi-
nosity function and the HON of galaxies in SZE selected
cluster sample to address cluster galaxy evolution questions
cleanly within a uniformly selected sample of the most mas-
sive clusters in the Universe. This work is complementary to
that of Hennig, C. et al. (2016), a study of optical properties
of a larger sample of 74 SZE selected clusters with a lower
average mass within a limited sky area of 200 deg2. Our goal
is to study how the galaxy components, separated into the
red subsample and the full sample within the virial radius,
change over cosmic time. By making reference to previous

sample. Masses where obtained from Bocquet et al. (2015) and
redshifts from Bleem et al. (2015).

studies that have been carried out on X-ray and optically se-
lected cluster samples, we have the opportunity to begin to
address the importance of sample selection in these studies.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
the observations and data reduction. In Section 3, we de-
scribe our tools and the simulations used to test them. In
Section 4 we present the main results of the study of the
galaxy populations in the SPT selected massive cluster sam-
ple. Conclusions of this study are presented in Section 5.
Magnitudes are quoted in the AB system. We assume a
ﬂat, ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70.2 km s−1 Mpc−1, and
matter density ΩM = 0.272, according to WMAP7 + BAO
+ H0 data (Komatsu et al. 2011). Masses are deﬁned as
M∆,crit = 4πr3
3 ∆ρcrit, where ρcrit = 3H 2/8πG is the critical
density of the Universe.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

In this work we use a sample of the most massive galaxy
clusters in the total 2500 deg2 SPT survey area that was
originally presented in Williamson et al. (2011). The sample
consists of 26 galaxy clusters with masses M200,crit > 1.2 ×
1015h

−1
70 M(cid:12) extending to redshift z = 1.13.
The optical photometric and spectroscopic data used in
this paper come from multiple observatories and they have
been processed using several pipelines. The data reductions
for a portion of the dataset are outlined in several papers
(High et al. 2010; Williamson et al. 2011; Song et al. 2012b).
In the following subsections we summarize the data and the
processing and calibration.

2.1 mm-wave Observations

The clusters presented here are the most massive systems
in the SPT-SZ survey area, which consists of a contiguous
2500 deg2 region deﬁned by the boundaries 20h ≤ R.A. ≤
24h, 0h ≤ R.A. ≤ 7h and −65◦ ≤ decl. ≤ −40◦. Mass es-
timation for the clusters has been carried out in a staged
manner, ﬁrst using simulations (Vanderlinde et al. 2010),

and then using a small number of X-ray YX measurements
(Benson et al. 2013; Reichardt et al. 2013). For details on the
SPT data processing there are several papers that describe
the method in detail (Staniszewski et al. 2009; Vanderlinde
et al. 2010; Shirokoﬀ et al. 2011).

2.2 Redshifts and Cluster Masses

Cluster redshifts ﬁrst appeared in the discovery paper
(Williamson et al. 2011), but since then additional spectro-
scopic redshifts have become available for six of these sys-
tems (Song et al. 2012b; Ruel et al. 2014; Sif´on et al. 2013;
Planck Collaboration et al. 2011a). Where possible we use
spectroscopic redshifts. The redshifts are listed in Table 1.
This table contains the SPT cluster name (with reference to
other names where they exist), the SPT sky position of the
cluster (R.A. and Decl.), the redshift (with two signiﬁcant
digits if a photo-z and with three if a spectroscopic redshift),
the SPT S/N, ξ, the estimated cluster mass, the virial radius
in arc minutes, and the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) po-
sition (R.A. and Decl.).

Although Williamson et al. (2011) reported M200,mean
and M500,crit masses for each cluster, we update the val-
ues of M500,crit using the Bocquet et al. (2015) code. We
convert the M500,crit to M200,crit (hereafter M200), using a
Navarro-Frenk-White proﬁle (NFW; Navarro et al. 1997)
and a concentration-mass relation from Duﬀy et al. (2008).
Masses are shown in Table 1 along with the corresponding
angular projected radii at which the cluster density reaches
200×ρcrit, hereafter r200, given the assumed cosmology.

2.3 Optical Imaging

The present cluster sample has been imaged with several in-
struments and telescopes, and with diﬀerent goals in mind:
from shallow photometry for photometric redshift estima-
tions to deep observations for weak lensing analysis (see Ta-
ble 2 for a list of the telescopes/instruments used). Those ob-
servations led to a heterogeneous dataset. To ‘homogenize’
the sample we set a common luminosity limit of m∗ + 2
(m∗ being the characteristic magnitude of the luminosity
function) at 10σ for each cluster, re-observing several of
them in order to achieve this goal. The data reduction is
performed using three diﬀerent pipelines, and they are sum-
marized below.

2.3.1 Mosaic2 Imager

The Mosaic2 imager was a prime focus camera on the Blanco
4m telescope until 2012 when it was decommissioned in
favour of the new wide ﬁeld DECam imager. Mosaic2 con-
tained eight 2048×4096 CCD detectors. However, one of the
ampliﬁers of CCD # 4 had been non-operational for the
last three years coinciding with these observations. Given
the fast optics at the prime focus on the Blanco, the pixels
subtend 0.27(cid:48)(cid:48) on the sky. Total ﬁeld of view is 36.8(cid:48) on a
side for a total solid angle per exposure of ∼0.4 deg2. More

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2016)

details on the Mosaic2 imager can be found in the online
CTIO documentation1.

The data from the Mosaic2 imager for this analysis is
reduced using a development version of the Dark Energy
Survey Data Management Pipeline (DESDM) (Desai et al.
2012). In the DESDM pipeline the data from each night ﬁrst
undergoes detrending corrections, which includes cross-talk
correction, overscan correction, trimming, and bias subtrac-
tion, as well as fringe corrections for i and z bands. Astro-
metric calibration is done using SCAMP (Bertin 2006) and
using the USNO-B catalog as the astrometric reference. Co-
addition is done using SWARP (Bertin et al. 2002). The single
epoch images contributing to the coadd are brought to a
common zeropoint using stellar sources common to pairs of
images. The ﬁnal photometric calibration of the coadd im-
ages is carried out using the stellar color-color locus, with
reference to the median SDSS stellar locus (Covey et al.
2007), as a constraint on the zeropoint oﬀsets between neigh-
boring bands, while the absolute calibration comes from
2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006).

Mosaic2 data has been acquired over the period of 2005
to 2012, both for the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS2 Desai
et al. 2012) and for the SPT targeted cluster followup. A
detailed description of the image corrections, calibration and
typical photometric and astrometric quality appears in Desai
et al. (2012).

2.3.2 WFI, IMACS, and Megacam

Clusters outside the BCS footprint were observed using vari-
ous instruments, including WFI, IMACS and Megacam. For
such observations, the strategy adopted was to adjust the
exposure time to reach a depth of 0.4L∗(m∗ +1) at 8σ, to ob-
tain robust red-sequence photometric redshifts (Bleem et al.
2015). This study required somewhat deeper imaging than
this photometric redshift estimation strategy, so the Wide
Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG 2.2-meter telescope at La
Silla was used to acquire deeper imaging in B−, V −, R−,
and I− ﬁlters. The initial imaging from IMACS on Magel-
lan (Dressler et al. 2003; Osip et al. 2008) was typically deep
enough to use in this study, and did not require additional
observations. We also use g, r, and i band data acquired with
the Megacam imager on Magellan (McLeod et al. 1998) for
an ongoing cluster weak lensing program (High et al. 2012,
Dietrich et al. in prep).

The processing of the WFI and IMACS data were done
with the PHOTPIPE pipeline (Rest et al. 2005; Garg et al.
2007; Miknaitis et al. 2007). WFI data were calibrated in
a procedure analogous to the Mosaic2 data. The colors of
stars in the science data were calibrated via the Stellar Lo-
cus Regression (SLR; e.g., High et al. 2009) technique to
a stellar sequence locus generated from a catalog of syn-
thetic stellar spectra from the PHOENIX library (Brott &
Hauschildt 2005). The synthetic stellar locus was calculated
in the WFI instrument magnitude system using CCD, ﬁl-
ter, telescope, and atmospheric throughput measurements.

As with the other data, the absolute calibrations were mea-
sured with respect to 2MASS point sources in each ﬁeld.

The Megacam data reduction was carried out at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Telescope
Data Center using the SAO Megacam reduction pipeline,
and also calibrated using the SLR technique. See High et al.
(2012) for a more detailed description of the observation
strategy and data processing.

2.3.3 FORS2

For two clusters at z = 0.87 and z = 1.132 in this sample,
we acquired VLT/FORS2 data in b−, I−, and z−band un-
der program Nos. 087.A-0843 and 088.A-0796(A) (PI Bazin),
088.A-0889(A,B,C) (PI Mohr) and 286.A-5021(A) (DDT, PI
Carlstrom). Observations were carried out in queue mode,
and were in clear, although generally not photometric, con-
ditions. The nominal exposure times for the diﬀerent bands
are 480 s (b), 2100 s (I), 3600 s (z). These were achieved by
coadding dithered exposures with 160 s (b), 175 s (I), and
120 s (z). Deviations from the nominal exposure times are
present for some ﬁelds due to repeated observations when
conditions violated speciﬁed constraints or when observing
sequences could not be completed during the semester for
which they were allocated. Data reduction and calibration
was performed with the THELI pipeline (Erben et al. 2005;

Schirmer 2013). Twilight ﬂats were used for ﬂatﬁelding. The
I− and z−band data were defringed using fringe maps made
with night sky ﬂats constructed from the data themselves.
To avoid over-subtracting the sky background, the back-
ground subtraction was modiﬁed from the pipeline standard
as described by Applegate et al. (2014).

The FORS2 ﬁeld-of-view is so small that only a few as-
trometric standards are found in the common astrometric
reference catalogs. Many of them are saturated in our ex-
posures. While we used the overlapping exposures from all
passbands to map them to a common astrometric grid, the
absolute astrometric calibration was done using mosaics of
F606W images centered on our clusters from the complimen-
tary ACS/HST programs 12246 (PI Stubbs) and 12477 (PI
High).

Because the data were generally not taken under pho-
tometric conditions, the photometric calibration was also
carried out using data from the HST programs. We derived
a relation between F814W magnitudes and the FORS2 I
Bessel ﬁlter (Chiu et al. 2016a)
mI − mF814W = −0.052 + 0.0095(mF606W − mF814W) ,

from the Pickles (1998) stellar library, which is valid for
stars with (mF606W − mF814W) < 1.7 mag. After the abso-
lute photometric calibration of the FORS2 I−band from
this relation, the relative photometric calibrations of the

other bands were ﬁxed using a stellar locus regression in the
(mb, mF606W, mI, mz) color-space. The inclusion of F606W
data in this process was necessary because the stellar lo-
cus in (mb, mI, mz) colors has no strong breaks as in the
(g − r, i − z) diagrams.

2.4 Completeness

In the majority of cases the photometry is complete to a
10σ level or better to a depth of m∗ + 2 and no correction
due to incompleteness is necessary. For the small fraction of
the sample for which this limit is not reached, a correction
is applied to enable analysis to a common depth relative
to the cluster galaxy characteristic magnitude. The correc-
tion follows our previous work in Zenteno et al. (2011): We
compare the griz count histograms to the deeper Canada-
France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS, Brim-
ioulle et al. 2008, private communication)3 by dividing both
count histograms. The resulting curve is ﬁt by an error func-
tion, which is used to account for the missing objects as we
approach the m∗ + 2 common depth. All clusters covered by
WFI-BVRI and VLT-Iz bands reach m∗ + 2 to a 10σ level
and no correction is applied in those cases.

3 CLUSTER GALAXY POPULATIONS: TOOLS

Song et al. (2012b) showed that if the SPT positional error
distribution is taken into account, BCGs in the SPT cluster
sample are distributed similarly to BCGs in X–ray selected
samples. Furthermore, several studies have shown the BCG
to be a good proxy for the cluster center, as deﬁned by X–
ray (e.g., Lin & Mohr 2004; Mann & Ebeling 2012) and by
weak lensing (e.g., Oguri et al. 2010), for the general cluster
population. For the following analysis we use the position of
the observed BCG (selected within r200 following Song et al.
2012b) as a proxy for the cluster center (coordinates listed
in Table 1) and its luminosity as a limit on the bright end, to
reduce the foreground contamination. Error bars in variables
are estimated with χ2 statistics, where the conﬁdence limits
are deﬁned as constant ∆χ2 boundaries (Press et al. 1992).

3.1 Radial Distribution of Galaxies

While simulations of dark matter (DM) present a consistent
and clear picture of the DM density proﬁles where the con-
centration depends strongly on redshift but only weakly on
mass (e.g., c(z) = 5.71×(1+z)−0.47(M/Mpivot)−0.084, Duﬀy
et al. 2008), simulations of subhaloes, where the galaxies are
expected to live, are less clear. In DM simulations it is found
that the radial distribution of subhaloes is roughly indepen-
dent of host halo mass and redshift. Also, as massive haloes
sink more rapidly in the cluster potential due to dynamical
friction, they lose mass more rapidly due to tidal stripping
(e.g., Angulo et al. 2009). When baryon physics is included,
the cores of the radial proﬁles steepen as the more tightly

bound baryons survive better in the central regions than DM
only subhaloes (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Dolag et al. 2009).
These processes may have an eﬀect on the observed galaxy
radial proﬁle as well as on the luminosity distribution.

On the observational side, no clear redshift trends have
been found to date. Observations of the galaxy distribution
have been carried out in clusters with diﬀerent redshifts and
masses. For example, using a local sample of 93 groups and
clusters with masses in the 3× 1013M(cid:12) − 2× 1015M(cid:12) range,
and at z < 0.06, Lin et al. (2004, hearafter L04) found a
concentration of cg,200c = 2.9+0.21−0.22 with no evidence of a
mass dependence. At a higher redshift, 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.4,
Budzynski et al. (2012) found cg,200c ≈ 2.6 independently
of both cluster mass and redshift, using 55,121 groups and
clusters from the SDSS-DR7.
Muzzin et al. (2007), using 15 CNOC clusters at 0.19 <
z < 0.55, found a concentration of 4.13 ± 0.57. At a much
higher redshift (z ≈ 1), Capozzi et al. (2012), using 15 clus-
ters with an average mass of M200 = 3.9 × 1014M(cid:12), found
a concentration of cg,200c = 2.8+1.0−0.8, completely consistent
with the lower redshift cluster samples.

Recently, van der Burg et al. (2014, 2015) studied the
evolution of the concentration comparing 60 clusters at
0.04 < z < 0.26 and 10 clusters at 0.86 < z < 1.34, ﬁnding
galaxy density concentrations of cg,200c = 2.31+0.22−0.18 (for the
M∗ > 1010M(cid:12) haloes) and cg,200c = 5.14+0.54−0.63, respectively.
While the low redshift sample agrees with the literature, the
concentration found for the high redshift sample is higher
than expected. As mentioned above, Capozzi et al. (2012)
found a concentration of cg,200c = 2.8+1.0−0.8 at similar red-
shifts but with masses only twice as large as van der Burg
et al. (2015). A larger sample at high redshift is needed to
test if this disagreement is due to strong mass dependence
in the concentration of galaxies in clusters, or due to other
causes. With the exception of van der Burg et al. (2014),
these results appear to point to no evolution in the concen-
tration up to a redshift of 1. We use the SPT-SZ selected
sample to test this picture using a uniformly selected sample
over a broad redshift range. The radial surface density pro-
ﬁles are constructed for both the full population and the red
population. The outer projected radius ranges from one to
three r200, which is the case for most clusters. Red galaxies
are selected if their colour lies within a ±3σ(±0.22) range
around the observed red sequence for that redshift (L´opez-
Cruz et al. 2004, see § 4.2.2 for details). In a larger sample it
is possible to measure the red sequence as a function of red-
shift, and then take a more restrictive approach to deﬁning
the red sequence population (see Hennig, C. et al. 2016).

The radial binning is done in two ways, depending on
how the data are combined and ﬁt. In one conﬁguration all
the data are stacked and ﬁtted to a common radius R200,
and in another a simultaneous ﬁtting on subsamples of indi-
vidual proﬁles (multi-ﬁt hereafter) is performed. We use χ2
statistics (with a number of members per bin of (cid:38) 15) with
a diﬀerent binning for each case. For the multi-ﬁt method,
which involves ﬁtting multiple individual cluster radial pro-
ﬁles, we bin the data in 0.05 × r200 with the ﬁrst bin and
bins beyond r200 being twice as wide. For the stacked case, in
which the individual cluster bins can be much ﬁner, we use
bins of 0.02× r200 size with the ﬁrst one being twice as wide,
up to R200. In addition, as a cross check, we perform individ-
ual ﬁts on single clusters. For the single cluster ﬁt we use bins

As in the latter case, the bins are scarcely populated, and we
use Cash (1979) statistics and a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) Ensemble sampler emcee from Foreman-Mackey
et al. (2013). The results are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

As in Zenteno et al. (2011), we have masked the satu-
rated stars in the ﬁeld and corrected for the eﬀective area
covered. This is done by gridding the data within a radial
bin tangentially by using an angular bin of 2 degrees (i.e.,
dividing the radial bin into 180 tangentially arranged bins).
Bins that fall within masked areas are discarded from the ra-
dial area calculation. Also, as a quality control, if two thirds
or more of the area of the annulus is lost, then the annulus
is discarded. This typically happens at the detector edges.

To compare with previous studies we ﬁt a projected
NFW proﬁle to our radial distribution. This density is mod-
eled as the number of galaxies in a cylinder within rings
divided by the ring area. The number of galaxies in a cylin-
der of radius r can be described analytically by integrating
the NFW proﬁle along the line of sight (e.g., Bartelmann
1996):

where ρs is the central density, rs = r200/cg is the scale
radius, cg is the galaxy concentration and x = cgr/r200. We
can parametrize this as a function of the number of galaxies
within a cylinder of r200 radius:

N r200

Combining this with Eq. 1 we can write the projected num-
ber of galaxies within r200 as a function of N r200

Thus, in the end we ﬁt cg, N r200
cyl (M ) plus a ﬂat background
Nbkg to our data. Note that even if all cluster galaxy
distributions had the same shape, we would still expect the
number of galaxies within the virial region N r200
cyl (M ) to
exhibit a cluster mass dependence.

Due to the heterogeneity of our optical imaging dataset
we have radial proﬁles extending from one to several r200,
and it is not possible to deﬁne a region for background esti-
mation that is uncontaminated by the cluster. We approach

Figure 2. Radial proﬁle of the stacked sample up to r200, using
all galaxies (black) and red sequence galaxies (red). These proﬁles
are well ﬁt by NFW proﬁles with the red subsample somewhat
more concentrated than the full sample, with concentrations of
2.84+0.40−0.37 and 2.36+0.38−0.35, respectively.

this problem in two ways: (1) we simply discard the back-
ground information and combine the data over the region
where all clusters have coverage (∼ 1r200, see Fig. 2) and (2)
we simultaneously ﬁt all clusters making use of the common
NFW shape parameters while marginalizing over individual
cluster backgrounds. That is, we ﬁt each cluster by ﬁxing
a common cg and N r200
but marginalizing over the indi-
cyl
vidual cluster background Nbkg. While in the former case
the χ2
stack comes from the single ﬁt, in the latter, the stack
χ2
stack is calculated as the sum of the individual cluster χ2
i
contributions. Errors are reported as the projection of the
1σ contour for 1 parameter (∆χ2

Although the mass range in the current sample is small
there are mass dependencies which need to be accounted for
in the stacking and multi-ﬁt processes. We do this by varying
N r200
from Eq. 2 as a function of the cluster mass M in the

The individual cluster LF is constructed using sources
within a projected r200, centered on the BCG. We perform
a statistical background subtraction using a background re-
gion at r > 1.5r200. In general, we make use of the photome-
try up to a 10σ level at an m∗ + 2 depth or even deeper. The
projected, background-corrected LF is then de-projected us-
ing an NFW proﬁle with a concentration of ccorr = 2.36 and
ccorr = 2.84, which corresponds to the stack value in Fig. 2
for the full and the red populations, respectively. Finally,
the cluster LF is divided into the diﬀerent magnitude bins
and scaled by the cluster volume in Mpc.

Corrections due to masked regions and background
over-subtraction are applied here as well. In the case of
masked regions within r200 we correct for the missing cluster
galaxies using the NFW proﬁle with the concentration ccorr.
Also, using the same model, we correct for the over subtrac-
tion due to cluster galaxies contaminating the background
dominated region. This over subtraction can be expressed
by an extra term N >1.5r200
clus,true

in the background:

N r200

clus,obs = N r200

total − AN × (N >1.5r200

+ N >1.5r200

(3)

where AN is the area normalization between cluster and
background. Under the assumption that there is no lumi-
nosity segregation and that the galaxy distribution is well
described by an NFW model with a given concentration,
we can connect the over subtraction to the galaxies within
r200 as N >1.5r200
clus,true. Combining with Eq. 3
we have a correction:

clus,true = τ (cg)N r200

clus,obs.

N r200

clus,true =

(1 − AN × τ (cg))

The average correction C is of the order of 1.11.
Finally, two of the clusters have only imaging from
VLT/FORS2 with a FOV of 7(cid:48)×7(cid:48), covering less than
1.5r200. For SPT-CLJ2106-5844 at z=1.131, the back-
ground area is re-deﬁned as the area at r > r200 with a
corresponding correction C, of 1.49. For the cluster SPT-
CLJ0102-4915, this re-deﬁned area is at the detector edge
and an external background is used. As a background area
we use the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS, Scoville
et al. 2007a) data, avoiding regions with known large scale
structures at the cluster redshift (Scoville et al. 2007b)4.

Once the LF is constructed we ﬁt it by the three pa-

rameter Schechter function (SF) (Schechter 1976),

φ(m) = 0.4 ln(10) φ

∗

100.4(m∗−m)(α+1) exp(−100.4(m∗−m)).

We ﬁt the SF to the stack, and to the individual luminosity
functions. In the single cluster case, simulations show that
there is little constraint on m∗ if the three variables are al-
lowed to ﬂoat within our typical luminosity range (see §3.4),
so our approach is to extract the parameters φ∗, m∗, and α
by ﬁxing one parameter and leaving the other two to ﬂoat.
Speciﬁcally, for the m∗ evolution analysis, we ﬁx α. We note
that the three parameters of the Schechter function are cor-
related, so ﬁxing one variable to the wrong value will have
an impact on the free parameter.

red sequence selected galaxies (top panel) and all galaxies (bot-
tom panel) within projected r200. Grey points represent the indi-
vidual cluster ﬁts using Cash statistics, and the ﬁve black points
are representative of the concentrations found by simultaneously
ﬁtting to ensembles of 5 clusters each. The central open circle
corresponds to the concentration extracted from the ﬁt of the
stacked sample up to r200 (see Fig. 2). Open squares in the bot-
tom panel correspond to values found in the literature. There is
some evidence for redshift evolution in the total sample given a
slope of −1.21 ± 0.59, and for the red subsample given the slope
of −1.74+0.62−0.64. The apparent trend is consistent between both the

stacked and the individual data.

3.2 Luminosity Function

As galaxy clusters grow by accreting galaxies from the cos-
mic web over time, these galaxies are also transformed by
processes such as merging and ram pressure stripping, for-
mation of new stars and the aging of their stellar popula-
tions (e.g., Dressler 1980; Butcher & Oemler 1984; Lin et al.
2004; Lopes et al. 2014; Gu et al. 2013). The evolution of
the cluster luminosity function encodes information about
these physical processes and is therefore an important tool.
For example, by studying the bright end of the cluster LF,
which is dominated by luminous early-type galaxies, several
studies have shown that the evolution is consistent with a
passively evolving stellar population (e.g., De Propris et al.
1999; Lin et al. 2006; Andreon et al. 2008; Capozzi et al.
2012), independent of the cluster’s dynamical state (De Pro-
pris et al. 2013). This indicates that the cluster galaxies have

For the stacked LF we ﬁt all three parameters. We
bring the data to a common frame ﬁtting in the space of
m − m∗
model, using a Composite Stellar Population model
(see § 4.2.2 for details). Once the data are brought to this
common frame, they are stacked using an inverse variance
weighted average:

ciated. We obtain N z=0
by correcting it by the evolutionary

factor E2(z), where E(z) =(cid:112)Ωm(1 + z)3 + ΩΛ. This scal-

ing is appropriate for self-similar evolution where the char-
acteristic density within the cluster virial region will scale
with the critical density of the universe.

3.3 Composite Stellar Population Models
Several studies have shown that m∗ evolution can be well
described by a passively evolving stellar population that has
formed at high redshift (e.g., De Propris et al. 1999; Andreon
2006; Lin et al. 2006; De Propris et al. 2007; Mancone et al.
2010). Empirically, these Simple Stellar Population (SSP)
models have been used to predict red sequence colors that
are then used to estimate cluster redshifts with character-
istic uncertainties of δz ∼ 0.025 (e.g., Song et al. 2012a,b).
Generally speaking, in an analysis of cluster galaxy popu-
lations over a broad redshift range it is helpful to have a
model within which the evolution and k-corrections are self-
consistently included to simplify the comparison of cluster
populations at diﬀerent redshifts within the observed bands.
In this analysis we create red sequence CSP models for
Mosaic2 and IMACS griz, WFI BV RI, and VLT BIz bands
using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) SSP models and the
EzGal python interface (Mancone & Gonzalez 2012). The
models consist of an exponentially falling star formation rate
with a decay time of 0.4 Gyr, Salpeter IMF, and a formation
redshift of 3. We use in total six diﬀerent metallicities to
introduce the tilt in galaxy red sequence within the color-
magnitude space. To calibrate these models we adopt the
measured metallicity-luminosity relation for Coma cluster
galaxies (Poggianti et al. 2001; Mobasher et al. 2003). This
procedure then requires a further adjustment of the Coma
L∗ luminosity (Iglesias-P´aramo et al. 2003) brightening it
by 0.2 magnitudes to reproduce the observed colour of the
Coma cluster. This calibrated set of CSP models allows us to
predict the apparent magnitudes and colors of all our cluster
populations within the range of relevant observed bands. As
described in § 4 below, by using the full sample of clusters
we can test whether this set of models is consistent with the
real galaxy populations.

3.4 Simulated Galaxy Catalogs

model(z = 0.35), while φ∗ is set by N r200

To test our methods, ﬁnd the best stacking strategy and
quantify possible biases, we create simulated galaxy catalogs
of a typical cluster. We re-create a galaxy cluster using the
number of galaxies in a cluster of mass M200 = 1.3×1015M(cid:12),
given the expected number of galaxies from measurements of
the halo occupation number (HON at low redshift, L04) and
with a concentration of 3 over a typical angular region on
the sky. This corresponds to a spherical number of galaxies,
within r200 and up to a magnitude of m∗ + 3, of N r200
sph = 335
cyl = 443. Although m∗ + 2 is our
and its projected value N r200
typical depth we extend the cluster counts to m∗ + 5 for
testing purposes. No luminosity segregation is included. We
assign galaxy magnitudes to match an LF with α = −1.2
and m∗ = m∗
sph . The
number of background galaxies used corresponds to 45,000
sources in the m∗ − 3 to m∗ + 5.5 luminosity range with a
brightness distribution equivalent of the CFHTLS r−band
count histogram used in § 2.4. The construction of the radial
proﬁles and luminosity functions is done using the same tools
as for the real clusters, accounting for the masked areas due
to CCD gaps, stars and missing CCDs.
As we mention in § 3.1, the multi-ﬁt stack approach uses
a typical bin size of 0.05r200, while the ﬁrst bin and the bins
beyond r200 are twice as wide. This conﬁguration is chosen
to balance a good number of galaxies ((cid:38) 15) per bin with the
need to have narrow enough bins to be able to constrain cg.
We ﬁt for cg and N r200
and marginalize over each individual
cluster background. We demonstrate this with the multi-
ﬁt method on ﬁve clusters using the region extending up
to 3r200 over 20 realizations, the concentration is recovered
within 1σ (3.09 ± 0.09).

cyl

Another way to use the data is to stack the cluster data
up to a common maximum radius. In this case there are
more galaxies per bin than in the single cluster case, giving
us the chance to explore ﬁner bins and to test that our re-
sults are not biased due to the chosen bin size. The common
maximum radius is reached at ∼ r200, set by the lowest red-
shift cluster. We use a bin set of 0.04, 0.02 and 0.1r200 for
the ﬁrst bin, the bins below r200 and the bins at > r200, re-
spectively. Simulations show that in the case of 25 clusters in
the stack, the input concentration is recovered within 1.5σ
(3.62+0.48−0.41). In comparison, when the same data are stacked
up to 3r200, the input values are recovered well within 1σ.

Using the multi-ﬁt stack binning conﬁguration, we also
test the individual results. Fitting for the radial proﬁle pa-
rameter cg, Ncyl and background in each individual simu-
lated cluster, over the 100 realizations, the weighted mean
of the concentration is recovered well within 1σ (cg =
2.97 ± 0.12). These tests give us conﬁdence that our bin-
ning strategy and our scripts are suited for use in extracting
measurements of the concentration of the galaxy clusters in
this study with biases that are at or below the statistical
uncertainty.
In the case of the luminosity function, we use and ap-
ply the conﬁguration and corrections described in § 3.2 (0.5
mag bin, count correction due to background over subtrac-
tion, star-masked areas, CCD gaps, etc.) to test our scripts
and assess the level of bias and or scatter under this conﬁg-

three SF parameters provides only weak constraints on m∗,
given that the typical depth pushes to m∗ + 2. To overcome
this we ﬁx one of the three parameter and explore the other
two: when α is ﬁxed the weighted mean value recovered for
m∗ is within 1.6σ. Conversely, if m∗ is ﬁxed, α is recovered
well to within 1σ. In the case of the HON, when m∗ is ﬁxed,
the true HON is recovered to 0.6σ and to 3.2σ when α is
the variable ﬁxed to the input value. Accordingly our ﬁrst
choice is to ﬁx m∗ when studying the HON.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Radial Proﬁle

The composite proﬁles for the full and red sequence selected
galaxies in the full sample of clusters are shown in Fig. 2.
The lines trace out the best ﬁt NFW proﬁles, which provide
a good description of the stacked galaxy proﬁles in both
cases. The best ﬁt concentration for the red galaxy sample
is 2.84+0.40−0.37, which is somewhat higher than that for the
total population of 2.36+0.38−0.35. The higher concentration for
the red subsample is consistent with the radial variations of
red fraction found in optical studies of other cluster samples
(e.g., Goto et al. 2004; Verdugo et al. 2012; Ribeiro et al.
2013; Gruen et al. 2013).

2.36+0.38−0.35 is somewhat lower when compared to previous es-
timates 2.9+0.21−0.22 at redshift zero (L04) and 2.8+1.0−0.8 at z ∼ 1
(Capozzi et al. 2012). Given the high masses of our sam-
ple, one may wonder if the diﬀerences reﬂect a mass depen-
dence on the concentration. While in DM simulations more
massive halos have lower concentration, the same simula-
tions do not show such a trend with galaxies. Some analyses
have shown a steep inverse mass dependence with concen-
tration (Hansen et al. 2005), while other analyses (including
many of the same clusters Budzynski et al. 2012) found no
such trend. They attribute the diﬀerence to diﬀerent ap-
proaches in deﬁning the radius in the two studies. van der
Burg et al. (2015) did ﬁnd a steep mass-concentration rela-
tion, although the two cluster samples are at very diﬀerent
redshifts. Nevertheless, for the high mass, low-redshift sam-
ple, the concentration found by van der Burg et al. (2015)
of cg,200c = 2.31+0.22−0.18 is in excellent agreement with ours.
Hennig, C. et al. (2016) used an SPT selected sample with a
lower mass average ﬁnding higher concentrations of 3.59+0.20−0.18
and 5.37+0.27−0.24 for the total and the red galaxy population,
respectively. This overall picture seems to point to a mass-
concentration relation steeper than DM only simulations.

The concentration measured as a function of redshift for
the SPT sample is shown in Fig. 3. The individual cluster ﬁts
are shown in light grey, pointing to an apparent evolution.
The multi-ﬁt over ﬁve bins with ﬁve clusters in each bin
conﬁrms this picture. Fitting a slope and intercept to the red
sample and full subsample we ﬁnd cg,red = 6.03+1.23−1.55 × (1 +
−1.74+0.62−0.64 and cg,all = 5.01+1.02−1.29 × (1 + z)−1.21±0.59 which
z)
correspond to 2.81σ and 2.05σ signiﬁcance respectively, of
a possible evolution. Also, the result from the stack over all
redshifts is consistent with this formula within the errors, as
expected.

4.2 Luminosity Function

Several studies have found that the steepness of the faint end
depends on the band chosen (e.g., Goto et al. 2002, 2005),
as bands bluer than the 4000˚A break are more sensitive to
younger populations. We systematically select the nearest
band redward of the 4000˚A, and are therefore less sensitive
in our study to recent star formation. The bands were chosen
as follows: r-band for 0 < z ≤ 0.35, i-band for 0.35 < z ≤
0.70, z-band for z > 0.70. In the case of BVRI the conditions
were V -band for 0 < z < 0.20, R-band for 0.20 < z < 0.40
and I-band for z > 0.40. For the two clusters with VLT data
(z ≥ 0.7), zGunn was used.

4.2.1 Stacked Luminosity Function

For the stacked LF we use 24 clusters. The two excluded clus-
ters are SPT-CL J2201-5956 which, with a z = 0.098 and
1.5× 1015M(cid:12) mass, has a projected r200 outside of the ﬁeld-
of-view, making it all but impossible to estimate the back-
ground contribution, and SPT-CLJ0555-6406, which has a
star ﬁeld as a foreground that makes the cluster normaliza-
tion unreliable.

As we mentioned in § 3.4, ﬁtting all three variables in
the LF produces large errors in the parameter exploration.
To address this problem, we use m∗ from the model or α
from the stacked LF to explore the remaining two LF pa-
rameters. In spite of the large errors during three parameter
SF ﬁts, we need at a minimum to check that the m∗ evo-
lution is consistent with our passively evolving CSP model.
Doing this we ﬁnd that a linear ﬁt to the observed m∗ distri-
bution as a function of redshift has a zero point of 0.25+0.41−0.41
and a slope of 0.33+1.21−1.20 for the total population. That is,
the normalization of our model is consistent to within the
uncertainties with the data, and the dataset over this broad
range of redshifts provides no evidence for a deviation from
the model. We also compare our model to red only galaxies
ﬁnding a slope of 0.20+0.37−0.37, also providing no evidence of
evolution of m∗ beyond the model. Nevertheless, the zero
point found is 0.54+0.17−0.17 which is signiﬁcant enough to war-
rant further model adjustments to account for the known
covariance between α and m∗. We explore corrections in the
model for the red-only population in § 4.2.2.

We proceed to stack the LF using the model m∗ to
bring all clusters to the same relative reference frame of
m − m∗
model. Next, we combine the data using the weighted
average in each bin (see Eq. 4). The stacked LF, as well
as the individual LFs, for all and red galaxies are shown
in Fig. 4. Data points shown contain contributions from
at least two clusters. The ﬁt to the stacked LF yields
all = 2.24+0.23−0.20 and αall = −1.06+0.04−0.03 for the total pop-
φ∗
rs = 2.21+0.16−0.15 and αrs = −0.80+0.04−0.03 for red
ulation, and φ∗
sequence galaxies.

Our best ﬁt faint end α for these SZE selected clusters
spanning a large range of redshift is consistent with measure-
ments using variously selected samples at diﬀerent redshifts
(Gaidos 1997; Paolillo et al. 2001; Piranomonte et al. 2001;
Barkhouse et al. 2007; Popesso et al. 2005, which provided
measurements of α = −1.09 ± 0.08, −1.11+0.09−0,07, −1.01+0.09−0,07,
−1, and −1.05 ± 0.13, respectively).

Initially φ∗ seems lower than in L04, a previous study.
L04 found a best ﬁt for their data of φ∗ = 4.43 ±
70 Mpc−3 for α = −0.84 ± 0.02 (best ﬁt), but found a
0.11 h3
lower φ∗ = 3.00± 0.04 h3
70 Mpc−3 when α is ﬁxed to= −1.1,
noting that both α’s described well their data. As our sys-
tems are more massive and the slope of the HON is less than
unity it is expected that our φ∗ solution would be lower than
that measured for lower mass systems. L04 also explore this
possibility, using their 25 most massive systems, with mean
mass of M500 = 5.3 × 1014 M(cid:12) ﬁnding α = −0.84 ± 0.03
and φ∗ = 4.00 ± 0.16 h3
70 Mpc−3. Given the dependence of
α and φ∗ shown and the mass range, this result using a red-
shift zero sample of clusters and 2MASS photometry seems
to be consistent with our result. A larger cluster mass range
is needed to carry out a more precise test.

low redshift counterparts of the same mass.

z=3 with a decay time of 0.4 Gyr and a Salpeter IMF tuned
with a range of metallicities to reproduce the tilt of the red
sequence population at low redshift provides a good descrip-
tion of the evolution of the cluster galaxy populations over
a broad range of redshift. It is important to emphasize that
our m∗’s are extracted from the band that is just redward of
the 4000 ˚A break, a band that would be expected to be rel-
atively insensitive to recent star formation. If red sequence
galaxies are used a similar result is obtained. The top panel
of Fig. 6 shows m∗ not evolving within the sample redshift
range (the slope found is −0.25+0.17−0.18). While there is no evi-
dence for evolution of m∗ for the red population, a non-zero
weighted average overall oﬀset of 0.46 is found (and applied
to the panel (a) of Fig. 6). We attribute this diﬀerence to the
m∗ − α covariance and we apply this correction for the red
galaxies only model by dimming the models by the corre-
sponding value. This correction in the model normalization
is important, as by ﬁxing a wrong m∗ model we would infer,
for example, an incorrect α. As a sanity check we remind
the reader that in § 4.2.1 we found an intercept of 0.54+0.17−0.17
for a three parameters SF ﬁtting, in full agreement with the
correction described above.

4.2.3 Evolution of φ∗
The LF normalization (φ∗) is the number of galaxies per
Mpc3 per unit magnitude, and it informs us, once the uni-
versal evolution of the critical density is scaled out, about
possible evolution of the number density of galaxies near
the characteristic magnitude in cluster environment. In our
study we are using the SZE data to give us the cluster mass
M200, the mass within the region of the cluster that has
a mean density of 200 times the critical density. Because
the critical density evolves with redshift as ρcrit ∝ E2(z)
where H(z) = H0E(z), we expect to see a higher character-
istic galaxy density at high redshifts. Thus, to explore for
density evolution beyond this we examine measurements of
φ∗/E(z)2 in the case where α is a free parameter and m∗
comes from the CSP model. Results appear in panel (c) of
Fig. 5 for all galaxies, and Fig. 6 for the red sequence sub-
sample. By ﬁtting a linear relation for both sets of measure-
ments, using m∗ ﬁxed to the model we ﬁnd best ﬁt param-
eters for the slope to be −0.47+0.30−0.29 for the red population,
consistent with no evolution. On the other hand, the total
population with a slope equal to −0.81+0.34−0.34 hints to a possi-
ble evolution at the 2.38σ level, with clusters having a lower
density of m∗ galaxies at higher redshift.
As already mentioned in § 4.2.1, our LF normalization
is consistent with values in the low redshift regime when ac-
counting for the high masses of our clusters. At high redshift
this is among the ﬁrst study of its kind. Our approach to
studying the characteristic galaxy density φ∗ requires good
mass estimates, and until recently these were not available
at redshifts z ∼ 1.

4.2.4 Evolution of the Faint End Slope α

The redshift evolution of the faint end slope α for all galax-
ies and for red galaxies is shown in panels (b) of Fig. 5
and Fig. 6. It can be seen that α changes to less negative
values at higher redshift with 0.29σ and 2.10σ signiﬁcance,

Figure 6. Same as Fig.5 for red sequence galaxies. Panel (a):
There is no signiﬁcant evolution in ∆mag = (m∗
dicating the CSP model provides a good description of cluster
galaxies over this redshift range. Panel (b): Evolution of α is sug-

model − m∗), in-

gested by the data with best ﬁt line having intercept −0.87+0.04−0.04
and slope 0.21+0.09−0.10. Panel (c): φ∗/E2(z) extracted when ﬁxed
m∗ is consistent with no evolution at 1.57σ level.

4.2.2 Evolution of m∗

Several previous studies have shown that the evolution of
m∗ for cluster galaxy populations can be described by a
passively evolving stellar population formed at high redshift
(e.g., De Propris et al. 1999; Andreon 2006; De Propris et al.
2007; ˇSuhada et al. 2012; Stalder et al. 2013). We test this
result by ﬁtting the LF using m∗ and φ∗ as free parameters
while ﬁxing α to the measurement from the stack. We com-
pare the obtained m∗ to a CSP model that is produced as
described in Sec. 3.3 above.
In panel (a) of Fig. 5 we show a comparison between the
observed m∗ and our CSP model. From this ﬁgure and the
1σ (grey) area, it is clear that the data and our CSP model
is in good overall agreement. A linear ﬁt with redshift yields
an intercept of 0.11+0.12−0.13 and a slope of −0.12+0.30−0.29. Thus,
our CSP model of an exponential burst of star formation at

for all and red population, respectively. That is, for the red
population there is weak evidence for fewer low luminosity
cluster galaxies relative to high luminosity cluster galaxies
at high redshift than in the local Universe. The best ﬁt lin-
ear relation has intercept −1.05+0.05−0.05/−0.87+0.04−0.04 and slope
−0.04+0.14−0.14/0.21+0.09−0.10 for all and red population, respectively.
Comparing the results from the total population with
low-z Abell Clusters, in bands redward of the 4000˚A break,
we ﬁnd a consistent picture. For example, Gaidos (1997)
observed 20 Abell Clusters in the R−band obtaining α =
−1.09 ± 0.08. Paolillo et al. (2001) constructed the LF us-
ing 39 Abell Clusters and found α = −1.11+0.09−0,07, in Gunn
r−band. Barkhouse et al. (2007) studied 57 Abell Clusters,
in RC band, constructing the red, blue and total LF. For
the total LF they ﬁnd an agreement with α = −1 in the re-
gion just fainter than m∗ and a steeper α as the photometry
gets deeper, in the range that is not covered by this study.
Also, Piranomonte et al. (2001) examined 80 Abell Clusters
ﬁnding α = −1.01+0.09−0,07 in Gunn r−band.

At higher redshifts, in agreement with low-z studies,
Popesso et al. (2005) used X–ray selected samples at red-
shift ≤ 0.25 and found a faint end slope α = −1.05 ± 0.13,
in r−band, for the brighter part of the LF and with a back-
ground subtraction method similar to our approach. Also, in
the same redshift range, Hansen et al. (2005) showed quali-
tatively that α = −1 is a good ﬁt to X–ray selected clusters
in r−band using SDSS data.

At ever higher redshift, the observational eﬀorts to ob-
tain the LF are more common in the infrared, as it is ex-
pected to track the stellar mass without great sensitivity
to recent star formation. Lin et al. (2006) used 27 clusters
at redshifts 0 < z < 0.9 to ﬁnd the low-redshift faint-
end slope of α = −0.9 qualitatively consistent with their
high redshift sample. Muzzin et al. (2007) found a similar
slope α = −0.84 ± 0.08 with a sample of 15 clusters at red-
shifts 0.2 < z < 0.5. Using Spitzer, Mancone et al. (2012)
found also shallower slopes, with α3.6µm = −0.97 ± 0.28
and α4.5µm = −0.91 ± 0.28 in lower mass clusters or groups
at < z >∼ 1.35. Recently, Chiu et al. (2016b) also used
Spitzer 3.6µm to construct the LF of 46 low mass systems,
within a wide redshift range. They found an LF faint slope
of α ∼ −0.9, within 0.1 < z < 1.02, consistent with no
evolution albeit with large error bars.

The literature points to little evolution of α, with high-
z cluster LFs being shallower (albeit with redder rest frame
bands). Our results show α evolution for the full popula-
tion consistent with no evolution up to redshift 1.1. For the
red population, there are several studies that show that the
red sequence LF slope evolves strongly with shallower α at
higher redshifts (e.g., De Lucia et al. 2004; Goto et al. 2005;
Tanaka et al. 2005; Barkhouse et al. 2007; Stott et al. 2007;
Gilbank et al. 2008; Rudnick et al. 2009). Our ﬁndings show
an evolutionary trend on αred as reported in previous works
at the 2.10σ level. Nevertheless, a closer inspection of panel
(b) of Fig. 6 seems to show that at the high redshift end the
trend is dominated by a single cluster, SPT-CLJ0102-4915,
observed with VLT and with a background subtraction done
with COSMOS data. To estimate the impact of the cluster
we perform a bootstrap resampling of the data, revealing a
similar positive trend in α evolution of 0.15 ± 0.14, but with
a lower signiﬁcance (1.08σ). A larger sample of SZE selected

clusters is needed to strengthen our results, especially in the
high redshift end.

4.3 Halo Occupation Number

We use a homogeneously selected cluster sample to char-
acterize the HON as a function of mass and redshift and
then to examine possible evolutionary trends. The Halo Oc-
cupation Number is obtained by integrating the Schechter
Function.

where the ﬁrst term accounts for the BCG, which is not part
of the LF, V is the cluster virial volume, ylow = Llow/L∗
and α and φ∗ are the values obtained in previous sections.
To compare to previous studies such as L04 we integrate the
LF to m∗ + 3 .

As can be seen in Fig. 7 the range of masses in our sam-
ple is quite small, and so it is not possible to constrain both
normalization and slope of the HON-mass relation. There-
fore, we adopt the slope of 0.87 reported in the literature
for a large sample of low redshift clusters (L04). With this
slope, we measure a normalization of 223.87+5.22−10.06 (1σ un-
certainties), which is lower than the value found by L04 of
267 ± 22.

Furthermore, we look for possible evolution by examin-
ing the ratio between our measured HON and the value at
the same mass obtained at low redshift (L04). In this analy-
sis we enhance the HON errors using the mass uncertainties
and the adopted mass slope of 0.87. Fitting a linear relation
in log space (see panel (d) in Fig. 5) we obtain −0.80+0.38−0.38
and 0.06+0.06−0.05 for the slope and intercept, respectively. Thus,
we ﬁnd evidence at the 2.11σ level that galaxy clusters at
high redshift have fewer galaxies per unit mass to m∗ + 3
than their low-z counterparts. This result is consistent with
Capozzi et al. (2012), where the HON was found to exhibit
a mild evolution.
One concern we have is that our VLT cluster LFs suﬀer
from background over-subtraction. As we mentioned in § 3.4
we use the NFW proﬁle to correct for cluster galaxies in the
deﬁned background region. While in the non-VLT data the
background is deﬁned at r > 1.5r200, for the VLT clusters it
is deﬁned at r > r200, which means that a larger correction is
being made to the measured background. This correction is
at the 12± 4% level for 23 clusters, while for SPT-CLJ2106-
5844 at z = 1.131, this correction is at the 49% level. In the
case of SPT-CLJ0102-4915 at z = 0.87 an external back-
ground is used (COSMOS), rendering a much lower HON
compared to the best ﬁt (see circled right point in Fig. 7),
although not constituting a clear outlier. This suggests that
the contamination corrections we apply to the VLT back-
grounds are not resulting in biased HON estimates. However,
in the complementary analysis of Hennig, C. et al. (2016),
which uses DES imaging data over large regions so that the
background subtraction is less problematic, there is a statis-
tically lower signiﬁcant evidence for redshift evolution.

extracted from the SPT-SZ survey. The VLT data is highlighted with circles. Shaded areas correspond to the 1, 2 and 3 σ errors in
the normalization given a ﬁxed slope of γ = 0.87. We ﬁnd a normalization at Mpivot = 1015M(cid:12) of 223.87+5.22−10.06 (1σ) lower than with
267 ± 22 from L04 (1 σ error contours shown as diagonal lines).

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have studied a cluster sample consisting of the 26 most
massive galaxy clusters selected in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ
survey. The masses range between M200,c = 1.2 × 1015M(cid:12)
and 2.7 × 1015M(cid:12), and the redshift range is broad 0.10 (cid:46)
z (cid:46) 1.13. We use the SZE based cluster mass to deﬁne the
virial region within which we study the optical properties
such as the radial proﬁle, the luminosity function and the
Halo Occupation Number.

The stacked radial proﬁle of the whole sample is
well described by an NFW model with a concentration of
2.36+0.38−0.35 which is low compared to the majority of the re-
sults found in the literature. Diﬀerences between our study
and previous works include the mass range, the redshift
extent and the selection. Using SDSS clusters and groups,
Hansen et al. (2005) found a strong inverse correlation be-
tween mass and concentration which may explain the lower
concentration we see in our high mass sample, although
Budzynski et al. (2012) did not ﬁnd such correlation using
a diﬀerent radius deﬁnition on the same dataset. Further-
more, our low concentration measurement is driven by clus-
ters in the higher redshift bin, which are not represented in

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2016)

most previously published samples (Carlberg et al. 1997; Lin
et al. 2004; Budzynski et al. 2012). A more similar sample
to compare to our higher redshift sample is that in Capozzi
et al. (2012). Although having a lower average mass than
our sample, the concentration found is cg = 2.8+1.0−0.8, which
is consistent with our ﬁndings.

We also stack the red galaxy population– deﬁned us-
ing a colour bin of ±0.22 centered on the red sequence at
each redshift, ﬁnding them to be more concentrated than
the total population at cg,red =2.84+0.40−0.37. A higher NFW
concentration in the red population is expected from the
observed radial distribution of the fraction of red galaxies,
which increases toward the center of the cluster (e.g., Goto
et al. 2004; Verdugo et al. 2012; Ribeiro et al. 2013; Gruen
et al. 2013).

Evidence for the redshift evolution of the concentration
for the full population is weak at the 2.05σ level. In the
case of the red sequence population the redshift evolution
index is −1.74+0.62−0.64, which provides evidence for evolution
at the 2.81σ level, a trend qualitatively in line with DM
only simulations (e.g., Duﬀy et al. 2008). As can be seen
in Fig. 3, this result is strongly dependent on the lowest

redshift cluster bin. A larger sample, in number of clusters
and area coverage, is required to further examine this issue.
The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is ideally suited to address
this question.

The stacked total luminosity function (LF) is well ﬁt
by a Schechter function with Schechter parameters: αall =
−1.06+0.04−0.03 and φ∗
all = 2.24+0.23−0.20. The faint end slope is found
to be consistent with previous studies of local clusters (e.g.,
Gaidos 1997; Paolillo et al. 2001; Piranomonte et al. 2001;
Barkhouse et al. 2007) and cluster at somewhat higher red-
shifts (e.g., Popesso et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2005). Also,
the φ∗ value found is somewhat lower than previous work
(L04, φ∗ = 4.00±0.16 h3
70 Mpc−3 for the case of the 25 most
massive systems, which has a median mass lower than ours),
although when considering the φ∗-α covariance they are in
qualitative agreement. The stacked red-sequence LF (rLF) is
also well ﬁt by a Schechter function with Schechter parame-
ters: αrs = −0.80+0.04−0.03 and φ∗
rs = 2.21+0.16−0.15. The αrs found is
consistent with previous studies (Gilbank et al. 2008; Rud-
nick et al. 2009).

We also ﬁt the LF of individual clusters using αall =
−1.06+0.04−0.03 from the stacked result to study the single clus-
ter m∗ evolution. We use the band which probes the portion
of the galaxy spectrum redward of the 4000 ˚A break over the
full redshift range. The m∗ behaviour with redshift yields a
slope of −0.12+0.30−0.29, indicating that the evolution of the char-
acteristic luminosity in this uniformly selected sample does
not deviate from the CSP model to which we compare. This
model is an exponential burst at z = 3 with decay time of
0.4 Gyr and a Salpeter IMF. This is broadly in agreement
with previous work, which has shown cluster galaxies are
generally well modeled by a passively evolving stellar popu-
lation that formed at redshift z > 1.5 (e.g., De Propris et al.
1999; Lin et al. 2006; Andreon et al. 2008; Mancone et al.
2010).

We used this result, ﬁxing m∗ to the CSP model pre-
dictions in the LF ﬁt to explore the α and φ∗ evolution. In
the case of α evolution, we ﬁnd a slope of −0.04+0.14−0.14, in-
dicating no evolution. In the rLF αred case, it is found to
evolve as 0.21+0.09−0.10, a 2.10σ level evidence for low redshift
clusters having a steeper faint end, indicating an evolution
in the ratio of bright/dwarf galaxies. Nevertheless, this sig-
niﬁcance is greatly reduced if we do a bootstrap resampling
of the data (1.08σ). The normalization φ∗/E2(z) measure-
ments provide no signiﬁcant evidence of redshift evolution
when m∗ is ﬁxed to the model for the red population, and
some evidence (2.38σ) for evolution of the total population.

We measure the HON, the number of galaxies within the
virial region more luminous than m∗ +3, comparing it to the
literature using a N ∝ M γ parametrization, and probing for
redshift trends. Due to the small mass range in our sample,
a simultaneous ﬁt of both the normalization and the slope
does not provide useful constraints. Therefore, we adopt a
slope of γ = 0.87 from the literature (L04) and ﬁt for the
normalization. We ﬁnd a normalization of 223.87+5.22−10.06 at a
mass M200 = 1015M(cid:12), which is lower than the normalization
of 267 ± 22, found in L04 from local clusters.

HON evolution with redshift is found to have a slope of
−0.80+0.38−0.38, providing some evidence (2.11σ) of a preference
for high redshift clusters to be less populated than their
lower redshift counterparts as suggested by Capozzi et al.

(2012) ﬁndings. A bigger sample is needed to investigate
further the HON.

These results are to be further tested as the Dark En-
ergy Survey is completed, enabling us to probe the galaxy
population variations not only with redshift but also with
mass.
