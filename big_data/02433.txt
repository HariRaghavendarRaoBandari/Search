k-TUPLE RESTRAINED DOMINATION IN GRAPHS

ADEL P. KAZEMI

Abstract. Let G be a graph of order n, and let k ≥ 1 be an integer. A
subset S ⊆ V (G) of the vertices of G is a k-tuple restrained dominating
set of G if each vertex in V (G) − S is adjacent to at least k vertices in
V (G) − S and to at least k vertices in S, and each vertex in S is adjacent
to at least k − 1 vertices in S. The minimum number of vertices of such
a set in G is the k-tuple restrained domination number of G. Also, the
maximum number of the classes of a partition of V (G) such that its all
classes are k-tuple restrained dominating sets of G is the k-tuple restrained
domatic number of G.

In this paper, we present some sharp bounds for the k-tuple restrained
domination number of a graph, and calculate it for some of the known
graphs. Also, we mainly present basic properties of the k-tuple restrained
domatic number of a graph.

1. Introduction

All graphs considered here are ﬁnite, undirected and simple. For standard
graph theory terminology not given here we refer to [10]. Let G = (V, E) be a
graph with the vertex set V of order n(G) and the edge set E of size m(G).
The open neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ V is NG(v) = {u ∈ V | uv ∈ E},
while its cardinality is the degree of v. Similarly, the open neighborhood and
the closed neighborhood of a subset X ⊆ V (G) are NG(X) = ∪v∈X NG(v) and
NG[X] = NG(X) ∪ X, respectively. The minimum and maximum degree of
G are denoted by δ = δ(G) and ∆ = ∆(G), respectively. If every vertex of
G has degree k, then G is called k-regular. We write Kn, Cn and Kn1,...,np
for a complete graph or a cycle of order n, or a complete p-partite graph,
respectively, while G[X] denotes the induced subgraph of G by the vertex set
X. The complement of a graph G, denoted G, is a graph with the vertex set

V (G) and two disjoint vertices v and w are adjacent in G if and only if they
are not adjacent in G.

For each integer k ≥ 1, the k-join G ◦k H of a graph G to a graph H of
order at least k is the graph obtained from the disjoint union of G and H by
joining each vertex of G to at least k vertices of H [7]. Also G ◦∗k H denotes
the k-join G ◦k H such that each vertex of G is joined to exactly k vertices of
H.

Deﬁnition 1.1. [6] The complementary prism GG of a graph G is the graph
formed from the disjoint union of G and G by adding the edges of a perfect
matching between the corresponding vertices (same label) of G and G.

For example, the graph C5C5 is the Petersen graph. Also, if G = Kn, the
graph KnKn is the corona Kn ◦ K1, where the corona G ◦ K1 of a graph G is
the graph obtained from G by attaching a pendant edge to each vertex of G.

Domination. The research of domination in graphs has been an evergreen
of the graph theory. Its basic concept is the dominating set and the domination
number. The literature on this subject has been surveyed and detailed in the
two books by Haynes, Hedetniemi, and Slater [4, 5]. A numerical invariant
of a graph which is in a certain sense dual to it is the domatic number of
a graph. Many other variants of the dominating set were introduced and
the corresponding numerical invariants were deﬁned for them, which we here
consider some of them from [3, 7, 8, 9].

Deﬁnition 1.2. [3] Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let G be a graph with
δ(G) ≥ k − 1. A subset S ⊆ V (G) is a k-tuple dominating set, brieﬂy kDS, in
G if for each x ∈ V (G), | N [x] ∩ S |≥ k. The minimum number of vertices of
a kDS in G is the k-tuple domination number γ×k(G) of G.

Deﬁnition 1.3. [7] Let k ≥ 1 be an integer and let G be a graph with
δ(G) ≥ k. A subset S ⊆ V (G) is a k-tuple total dominating set, brieﬂy kTDS,
of G if for each x ∈ V (G), |N (x) ∩ S| ≥ k. The minimum number of vertices
of a kTDS of G is the k-tuple total domination number γ×k,t(G) of G.

Deﬁnition 1.4. [8] In a graph G = (V, E) with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1, a k-tuple total
restrained dominating set S, brieﬂy kTRDS, of G is a k-tuple total dominating
set of G such that each vertex of V − S is adjacent to at least k vertices in
V − S. The k-tuple total restrained domination number γr
×k,t(G) of G is the
minimum cardinality of a kTRDS of G.

The domatic number d(G) and the total domatic number dt(G) of a graph
G were introduced in [1] and [2], respectively. Sheikholeslami and Volkmann in
[9] extended the last deﬁnition to the k-tuple total domatic number as follows.

k-tuple restrained domination in graphs

Deﬁnition 1.5. [9] The k-tuple total domatic partition, brieﬂy kTDP, of G
is a partition D of the vertex set of G such that all classes of D are k-tuple
total dominating sets of G. The maximum number of classes of a k-tuple total
domatic partition of G is the k-tuple total domatic number d×k,t(G) of G.

In a similar way, Kazemi in [8] deﬁned the k-tuple total restrained domatic

number and the star k-tuple total restrained domatic number as follows.

Deﬁnition 1.6. [8] The k-tuple total restrained domatic partition, brieﬂy
kTRDP, of a graph G is a partition D of the vertex set of G such that all
classes of D are k-tuple total restrained dominating sets in G. The maximum
number of the classes of a kTRDP of G is the k-tuple total restrained domatic
number dr

×k,t(G) of G.

In this paper, we introduce and study two new concepts: k-tuple restrained

domination number and k-tuple restrained domatic number.

Deﬁnition 1.7. In a graph G with δ(G) ≥ k − 1, a k-tuple restrained dom-
inating set S, brieﬂy kRDS, is a k-tuple dominating set of G such that each
vertex of V (G) − S is adjacent to at least k vertices of V (G) − S. The k-tuple
restrained domination number γr
×k(G) of G is the minimum cardinality of a
kRDS in G.

Deﬁnition 1.8. The k-tuple restrained domatic partition, brieﬂy kRDP, of a
graph G with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 is a partition of V (G) to some k-tuple restrained
dominating sets of G. The maximum number of the k-tuple restrained domi-
nating sets of a kRDP of G is the k-tuple restrained domatic number dr
×k(G)
of G. Similarly, the star k-tuple restrained domatic number dr∗
×k(G) of G is the
maximum number of the k-tuple restrained dominating sets of a kRDP of G
such that at least one of them has cardinality γr

×k(G).

We recall that the 1-tuple restrained dominating set and the 1-tuple re-
strained domination number γr
×1(G) of a graph G are known as the restrained
dominating set and the restrained domination number γr(G) of G, respec-
tively.

Through this paper, k is a positive integer, and if v is a vertex in G, v
denotes its corresponding vertex in G. Also for the cycle Cn of order n, we
assume V (Cn) = {i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, and E(Cn) = {ij | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and if j ≡ i + 1
(mod n)}.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we calculate γr

×k(G), where
G is Kn, Cn, Cn or a bipartite graph. Also we present some bounds for the
k-tuple restrained domination number of the complete multipartite graph.
Then, in Section 3, we characterize the structure of graphs G that γr
×k(G) =

m, for each m ≥ k, and give upper and lower bounds for γr
×k(G) when G
is an arbitrary graph.
In Section 4, we mainly present basic properties of
the k-tuple restrained domatic number of a graph and give some bounds for
it. Also we give some suﬃcient conditions for that the k-tuple domination
(respectively domatic) number of a graph be equal to the k-tuple restrained
domination (respectively domatic) number of it. Finally, in the last section,
we give some sharp bounds for the k-tuple restrained domination number of
the complementary prism GG in terms of the same numbers of G and G.

The following proposition is useful in our investigation.

Proposition 1.9. (Kazemi [8] 2011) For any graph G with δ(G) ≥ k ≥ 1,
dr
×k,t(G) = d×k,t(G).

2. k-tuple restrained domination in some graphs

In this section, we calculate γr

×k(G), where G is Kn, Cn, Cn or a bipartite
graph. Also we present some bounds for the k-tuple restrained domination
number of a complete multipartite graph. First we state the following obser-
vation.

Observation 2.1. For any graph G of order n,

×k(G) ≤ d×k(G),

×k,t(G) ≤ dr
×k,t(G) ≤ d×k,t(G) ≤ d×k(G),
×k(G) = 1 if δ(G) ≤ 2k − 1,

i. dr
ii. dr
iii. dr
iv. ∆(G) ≥ 2k and γr
×k(G) < n, and so n ≥ 2k + 1,
v. every vertex of degree at most 2k − 1 of G and at least k − 1 of its

×k(G) ≤ n − k − 1 if γr

neighbors belong to every kRDS.

Proposition 2.2. For any integers n > k ≥ 1,

γr

×k(Kn) = (cid:26) n if n ≤ 2k,

k otherwise.

Proof. Observation 2.1 (v) implies that γr
every k-subset of vertices is a kRDS in Kn, we obtain γr
2k + 1.

×k(Kn) = n if n ≤ 2k. Since also
×k(Kn) = k if n ≥
(cid:3)

In the next three propositions, we ﬁnd the k-tuple restrained domination

number of a cycle and its complement.

Proposition 2.3. For any integer n ≥ 3,

and

×2(Cn) = γr
γr

×3(Cn) = n,

γr(Cn) = (cid:26) ⌈ n
3 ⌉ + 1 if n ≡ 2 (mod 3),
⌈ n
3 ⌉

otherwise.

k-tuple restrained domination in graphs

Proof. Observation 2.1 (v) implies that γr
×3(Cn) = n. Now let
n ≡ r (mod 3), where 0 ≤ r ≤ 2. Since the sets S0 = {1+3i | 0 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ n
3 ⌋−1},
S1 = S0 ∪ {n} and S2 = S1 ∪ {n − 1} are restrained dominating sets in Cn
with smallest cardinality, when r is 0, 1, 2 respectively, we obtain

×2(Cn) = γr

γr(Cn) = (cid:26) ⌈ n
3 ⌉ + 1 if n ≡ 2 (mod 3),
⌈ n
3 ⌉

otherwise.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.4. Let n ≥ 4. Then

γr(Cn) = 


4 if n = 4,
3 if n = 5,
2 otherwise.

Proof. If n = 4, then C4 = 2K2, and so γr(C4) = 2γr(K2) = 4, by Proposition
2.2. Let n ≥ 5. Then γr(Cn) ≥ 2. It can easily be veriﬁed that γr(C5) = 3.
Since {1, 4} is a RDS of Cn for n ≥ 6, we obtain γr(Cn) = 2.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.2 implies that γr
γr
×k(Cn), when n ≥ 5 and k ≥ 2.

×2(C4) = 4. In the next proposition we ﬁnd

Proposition 2.5. Let n ≥ 5 and let 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 3. Then

γr

×k(Cn) = 


if n ≤ 2k + 2,

n
k + 2 if 2k + 3 ≤ n ≤ 3k,
k + 1 otherwise.

Proof. Note that Cn is (n − 3)-regular. If n ≤ 2k + 2, then γr(Cn) = n, by
Observation 2.1 (v). Let n ≥ 2k + 3. Then obviously γr
×k(Cn) ≥ k + 1. Let S
be an arbitrary kRDS in Cn. It can easily be veriﬁed that | S |= k + 1 if and
only if there exist at most two vertices i and j in S such that | j − i |= 1, and
for the other diﬀerent vertices t and ℓ, | ℓ−t |≥ 3. Since this holds if and only if
n ≥ 3k + 1, we obtain γr
×k(Cn) ≥ k + 2 if 2k + 3 ≤ n ≤ 3k. Now by considering
the sets S = {1} ∪ {3i + 2 | 0 ≤ i ≤ k} and S′ = {2i + 1 | 0 ≤ i ≤ k + 1} as
k-tuple restrained dominating sets of Cn for n ≥ 3k + 1 and 2k + 3 ≤ n ≤ 3k,
respectively, we obtain

γr

×k(Cn) = (cid:26) k + 2 if 2k + 3 ≤ n ≤ 3k,

k + 1 otherwise.

Now we present some bounds on the k-tuple restrained domination number

of a bipartite graphs.

(cid:3)

A. P. Kazemi

Proposition 2.6. Let G be a bipartite graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1. Then

2k − 2 ≤ γr

×k(G) ≤ n.

×k(G) = 2k − 2 if and only if G is isomorphic to the complete

Further, γr
bipartite graph Kk−1,k−1.
Proof. Let G be a bipartite graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1, which is partitioned
to the independent sets X and Y . Let S be an arbitrary kRDS of G, and let
w ∈ X and z ∈ Y . The deﬁnition of k-tuple restrained dominating set implies
that |S ∩ N (w)| ≥ k − 1 and |D ∩ N (z)| ≥ k − 1. Since N (w) ∩ N (z) = ∅, we
deduce that |D| ≥ 2k − 2 and thus 2k − 2 ≤ γr

×k,t(G) ≤ n.

If G is isomorphic to Kk−1,k−1, then γr

×k(G) = 2k−2, by Observation 2.1 (v).
Now let S be a γr
×k-set of G of cardinality 2k−2. Then |S∩X| = |S∩Y | = k−1.
Since every vertex in X or Y is adjacent to exactly k − 1 vertices in S, we
conclude that X − S = Y − S = ∅. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the complete
bipartite graph Kk−1,k−1.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.7. Let G be a bipartite graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1. If G is not
isomorphic to Kk−1,k−1, then 2k ≤ γr



2k
k + m if n ≥ 2k > m,
n + m if 2k > n ≥ m ≥ k − 1.

Now we present some bounds for the k-tuple restrained domination number

of a complete p-partite graph, when p ≥ 3.

Proposition 2.9. For any integer p ≥ 3, if G is a complete p-partite graph,
then

γr
×k(G) ≥ ⌈

⌉.

Proof. Let G = Kn1,...,np be a complete p-partite graph with the partition
V (G) = X1 ∪ ... ∪ Xp to the independent sets X1, ..., Xp, where |Xi| = ni for
each i. Let n = n1 + ... + np, and let S be an arbitrary kRDS of G, in which
Si = Xi ∩ S and |Si| = si for each i. Since every vertex in Xi is adjacent to

p

at least k − 1 vertices in S − Xi =

Sj, we obtain

Si6=j=1

sj − si ≥ k − 1,

p

for each 1 ≤ i ≤ p. Hence (p − 1)|S| ≥ p(k − 1), and so |S| ≥ ⌈ p(k−1)
S is an arbitrary kRDS of G, we obtain γr

×k(G) ≥ ⌈ p(k−1)

p−1 ⌉. Since

For giving an upper bound for the k-tuple restrained domination number
of a complete p-partite graph G with p ≥ 3, we use the following deﬁnitions
and notations.

Let G = Kn1,...,np be a complete p-partite graph with the partition V (G) =
X1 ∪ ...∪ Xp to the independent sets X1, ..., Xp, where |Xi| = ni for each i. Let
n = n1 + ... + np, and let S be a kRDS of G and let Si = Xi ∩ S, S′
i = Xi − S
and |Si| = si for each i. Consider t(S) as the number of indices i that si < ni
and deﬁne

t0 = min{t(S)|S is a kRDS in G}.

Then t(S) ≥ 1, because t0 = 0 if and only if γr
×k(G) = n. Obviously t(S) ≥ 2.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that si < ni if and only if 1 ≤ i ≤
t(S). Let wj ∈ Xj − S = Xj − Sj for each 1 ≤ j ≤ t(S). Since S is a kRDS of
G, we obtain |N (wj) ∩ (V − S)| ≥ k. Hence for any 1 ≤ j ≤ t(S),

k ≤ |N (wj ) ∩ (V − S)|

Therefore, we have proved the next proposition.

3. Some bounds

In this section, for any integer m ≥ k, we characterize graphs G with
×k,t(G) = m. Then we present some bounds for γr
γr
×k(G) in terms on k, the
order and the size of G.

Theorem 3.1. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1. Then for any integer

×k(G) = m if and only if G = K ′

m of Km with δ(F ) ≥ k and δ(K ′

m or G = F ◦k K ′

Proof. For any integers m ≥ k ≥ 2, let S be a γr
×k(G)-set of cardinality m.
Then every vertex v has at least k or k − 1 neighbors in S if v ∈ V (G) − S or
v ∈ S, respectively. Also, every vertex in V (G) − S has at least k neighbors
in V (G) − S. Thus G[S] = K ′
m of Km with
δ(K ′
If |V (G)| > m, let F be
the induced subgraph G[V (G) − S]. Then δ(F ) ≥ k and G = F ◦k K ′

the deﬁnition of the k-tuple restrained domination number implies that m is
minimum with this property.

Corollary 3.2. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1. Then γr
and only if G = Kk or G = F ◦k Kk, for some graph F with δ(F ) ≥ k.

×k(G) = k if

Proof. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with minimum degree at least k − 1 on n
vertices and with m edges, and let S be a kRDS of G with minimum cardinality.
Since S is also a kDS in G, δ(G[S]) ≥ k − 1 and δ(G[V − S]) ≥ k, we obtain

where m1 and m2 are respectively the number of edges in the induced sub-
graphs G[S] and G[V − S] and m3 is the number of edges connecting vertices
of V − S to the vertices of S. By summing the inequalities, we obtain

m = m1 + m2 + m3 ≥

H = G[S] of order γr
×k(G) and the k-regular graph F = G[V (G) − S] of order
n − γr
×k(G), respectively, while the third equality means that every vertex of
F is adjacent to exactly k vertices of H. Hence equality holds in (3.1) if and
only if G is isomorphic to F ◦∗k H.

As an example, if G is the complete graph K2k+1, then γr

4. Basic properties

In this section, we mainly present basic properties of the k-tuple restrained
domatic number of a graph and give some other bounds on it. First, we give
a proposition which its proof is left to the reader.

Proposition 4.1. For any integers n ≥ k ≥ 1, dr

×k(Kn) = ⌊ n

k ⌋.

Theorem 4.2. If G is a graph of order n with δ(G) ≥ k − 1, then

×k(G) · dr

×k(G) ≤ n.

Moreover, if γr
with d = dr

×k(G), each set Vi is a γr

×k(G)-set.

×k(G) · dr

×k(G) = n, then for each kRDP {V1, V2, ..., Vd} of G

Proof. Let {V1, V2, ..., Vd} be a kRDP of G such that d = dr

×k(G) · dr

If γr
×k(G) = n, then the inequality occurring in the proof becomes
equality. Hence for the kRDP {V1, V2, ..., Vd} of G and for each i, |Vi| =
×k(G). Thus each set Vi is a γr
γr
(cid:3)

×k(G)-set.

An immediate consequence of Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 3.2 now follows.

Corollary 4.3. If G is a graph of order n with δ(G) ≥ k − 1, then

dr
×k(G) ≤

n

,

with equality if and only if G = Kk or G = F ◦k Kk for some graph F with
δ(F ) ≥ k.

Proposition 2.6 and Corollary 2.7 improve the bound given in Corollary 4.3

for bipartite graphs.

Proposition 4.4. Let G be a bipartite graph of order n with δ(G) ≥ k −1 ≥ 1.
If G is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph Kk−1,k−1, then dr
×k(G) =
2k−2 , and if G is not isomorphic to Kk−1,k−1, then dr

×k(G) ≤ n

The next theorem presents a suﬃcient condition for the k-tuple restrained

domatic number of a graph be equal to the its k-tuple domatic number.

Theorem 4.5. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k−1 ≥ 0. If (d×k(G), d×k,t(G)) 6=
(2, 1), then dr

×k(G) = d×k(G).

Proof. If d×k(G) = 1, then dr
×k(G) = d×k(G), by Observation 2.1 (i). Now let
d×k(G) ≥ 3. Let d = d×k(G) and let D = {D1, ..., Dd} be a k-tuple domatic
partition of G. Choose D1 as an arbitrary class of D. Let x ∈ V (G) − D1 =
D2 ∪ D3 ∪ · ∪ Dd. Without loss of generality, let x ∈ D2. As D1 is a kDS of G,
there exists a k-set S1
x ⊆ N (x) ∩ D1. Also since D3 is a kDS of G,
x ⊆ N (x) ∩ D3. We have S3
there exists a k-set S3
x ⊆ V (G) − D1,
because D1 ∩ D3 = ∅. On the other hand, if x ∈ D1, then |N [x] ∩ D1| ≥ k,
because D1 is a kDS of G. Therefore, we have proved that D1 is a kRDS
of G. The set D1 was chosen arbitrarily, therefore D is a k-tuple restrained
domatic partition of G and d×k(G) ≤ dr

Observation 2.1 (i).

Now let d×k(G) = d×k,t(G) = 2. Then dr

×k,t(G) = 2, by Proposition 1.9,

and so

2 = dr

×k,t(G) ≤ dr

×k(G) ≤ d×k(G) = 2,

by Observation 2.1 (i), which implies d×k(G) = dr

×k(G).

Corollary 4.6. Let G be a graph. If (d(G), dt(G)) 6= (2, 1), then dr(G) =
d(G).

The condition (d×k(G), d×k,t(G)) 6= (2, 1) in Theorem 4.5 is necessary. For
×k(G) = 1. In

example, if G = K2k+1, then d×k(G) = 2, d×k,t(G) = 1 but dr
continuation, we present a suﬃcient condition for γr

×k(G) = γ×k(G).

Theorem 4.7. Let G be a graph with δ(G) ≥ k − 1 ≥ 1. If d∗
γr
×k(G) = γ×k(G).

×k(G) ≥ 3, then

Proof. Since every kRDS of G is also a kDS of G, we have γ×k(G) ≤ γr
×k(G).
For the converse inequality, since d∗
×k(G) ≥ 3, let S, S′ and S′′ be three
pairwise disjoint k-tuple dominating sets of G such that S is a γ×k(G)-set.
Since S′ and S′′ are also two k-tuple dominating sets of G, each vertex x ∈
V (G) − S is adjacent to at least k − 1 vertices in S′ and to at least k − 1
vertices in S′′. Also this facts that S′ and S′′ are disjoint and k ≥ 2 imply
that x is adjacent to at least k vertices in V (G) − S. Hence S is a kRDS
of G, and γr
×k(G) ≤ |S| = γ×k(G). The previous two inequalities imply
γr
×k(G) = γ×k(G).
(cid:3)

The converse of Theorem 4.7 does not hold. For example, if 5 ≤ 2k + 1 ≤
×k(Kn) = 2. Also the
×k(G) ≥ 3 in Theorem 4.7 can

n ≤ 3k − 1, then γr
following example shows that the condition d∗
not be replaced by d×k(G) ≥ 3.

×k(Kn) = γ×k(Kn) = k but d∗

Example 4.8.
Let G be a graph of order 16 with V (G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., 16} and

E(G) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8),

(3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (4, 15),
(4, 16), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10), (11, 12), (13, 14), (15, 16)}.

Then γ(G) = 3, because the set {2, 3, 4} is the unique dominating set of
smallest cardinality. Also γr(G) = 4. For example the set {3, 4, 5, 6} is
a restrained dominating set in smallest cardinality. Since each of the sets
{1, 2, 9, 11, 13, 15}, {3, 5, 7, 14, 16} and {4, 6, 8, 10, 12} are three disjoint domi-
nating sets of G, then d(G) ≥ 3.

5. The complementary prisms

First, we calculate the k-tuple restrained domination number of the com-

plementary prism of a regular graph for some integer k.

Theorem 5.1. Let k and ℓ be integers such that 0 ≤ k − 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k − 3. If
G is a ℓ-regular graph of order n, then

γr
×k(GG) ≥ n + k,

with equality if and only if n ≥ ℓ + 2k and V (G) contains a k-subset T such
that for each vertex i ∈ V (G), |N (i) ∩ T | ≥ k − 1 and |N (i) ∩ (V (G) − T )| ≥ k
if i ∈ V (G) − T , and |N (i) ∩ T | ≥ k − 2 otherwise.

Proof. Let V (GG) = V (G) ∪ V (G) such that V (G) = {i|1 ≤ i ≤ n} and
V (G) = {i|1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Let n ≥ 2k + ℓ, and let S be an arbitrary kRDS of
GG. Since each vertex i has degree ℓ + 1 ≤ 2k − 2, Observation 2.1 (v) implies
V (G) ⊆ S. Let i 6∈ S. Then |N (i)∩V (G)∩S| ≥ k−1. If |N (i)∩V (G)∩S| ≥ k,
then we have nothing to prove. Thus let N (i) ∩ V (G) ∩ S = {ji|1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}.
This implies that there exists a vertex t ∈ S − {ji|1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} such that its
corresponding vertex t in G is adjacent to some vertex ji, when 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Hence |S| ≥ n + k. Since S was arbitrary, we obtaion γr

×k(GG) ≥ n + k.

It can easily be veriﬁed by the reader that γr

×k(GG) = n + k if and only
if n ≥ ℓ + 2k and V (G) contains a k-subset T such that for each vertex
i ∈ V (G), |N (i) ∩ T | ≥ k − 1 and |N (i) ∩ (V (G) − T )| ≥ k if i ∈ V (G) − T ,
and |N (i) ∩ T | ≥ k − 2 otherwise.
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.2. Let k and ℓ be integers such that 0 ≤ k − 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k − 3. If
G is a ℓ-regular graph of order n ≤ ℓ + 2k − 1, then γr

×k(GG) = 2n.

Corollary 5.3. For any integer n ≥ 4,

γr

×2(CnCn) = (cid:26) 2n

if n = 4, 5,
n + 2 otherwise.

Corollary 5.4. For any integer n ≥ 5,

γr

×3(CnCn) = (cid:26) 2n

if n = 5, 6, 7,

n + 3 otherwise.

The next theorem gives some lower and upper bounds for γr

×k(GG), where

G is an arbitrary graph.

Theorem 5.5. If G is a graph of order n with min{δ(G), δ(G)} ≥ k − 1, then

γr
×(k−1)(G) + γr

×k(G) + γr
where k ≥ 2 in the lower bound and k ≥ 1 in the upper bound.

×(k−1)(G) ≤ γr

×k(GG) ≤ γr

×k(G),

k-tuple restrained domination in graphs

13

Proof. To prove the lower bound, let k ≥ 2 and let D be a kRDS of GG. Since
every vertex in V (G) (respectively in V (G)) is adjacent to only one vertex in
V (G) (respectively in V (G)), we have a nontrivial partition D = D′ ∪ D′′ such
that D′ is a (k − 1)RDS of G and D′′ is a (k − 1)RDS of G. Hence

γr
×(k−1)(G) + γr

×(k−1)(G) ≤ |D′| + |D′′| = |D| = γr

×k(GG).

To prove the upper bound, let k ≥ 1 and let S and S′ be a γr
×k(G)-set and
×k(G)-set, respectively. Then the set S ∪ S′ is a kRDS of GG, implying

a γr
that

γr
×k(GG) ≤ γr

×k(G) + γr

×k(G).

(cid:3)

Propositions 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and Corollaries 5.3, 5.4 shows that if G = Cn,
then the lower bound in Theorem 5.5 is sharp for k = 3 and 5 ≤ n 6= 7, and
also the upper bound in Theorem 5.5 is sharp for k = 3 and 5 ≤ n ≤ 7, or
(k, n) = (2, 5).
