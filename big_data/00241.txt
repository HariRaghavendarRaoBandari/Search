AN EXTENSION THEOREM FOR CONVEX FUNCTIONS

OF CLASS C 1,1 ON HILBERT SPACES

DANIEL AZAGRA AND CARLOS MUDARRA

Abstract. Let H be a Hilbert space, E ⊂ H be an arbitrary subset
and f : E → R, G : E → H be two functions. We give a necessary
and suﬃcient condition on the pair (f, G) for the existence of a convex
function F ∈ C 1,1(H) such that F = f and ∇F = G on E. We also show
that, if this condition is met, F can be taken so that Lip(∇F ) = Lip(G).

1. Introduction and main results

Throughout this paper H will be a real Hilbert space equipped with inner
product h· , ·i. The norm in H will be denoted by k · k. By a 1-jet (f, G)
on a subset E ⊂ H we understand a pair of functions f : E → R, G :
E → H. Given a 1-jet (f, G) deﬁned on E ⊂ H, Le Gruyer proved in [9]
that a necessary and suﬃcient condition on the jet (f, G) for having a C 1,1
extension F to the whole space H is that

Γ(f, G, E) := sup

x,y∈E(cid:16)qA2

x,y + B2

x,y + |Ax,y|(cid:17) < ∞,

where

Ax,y =

2(f (x) − f (y)) + hG(x) + G(y), y − xi

kx − yk2

and

Bx,y =

kG(x) − G(y)k

kx − yk

for all x, y ∈ E, x 6= y.

This condition is equivalent to

y∈H

sup
a6=b∈E

f (a) − f (b) + hG(a), y − ai − hG(b), y − bi

and in particular Le Gruyer’s Theorem provides a generalization (to the
setting of Hilbert spaces) of Glaeser’s version of the Whitney Extension
Theorem [13, 8] for C 1,1 functions. See also [12] for another generalization

of the C 1,1 version of the Whitney Extension Theorem for functions deﬁned
on subsets of the Hilbert space, and for a proof that the Whitney Extension
Theorem fails for C 3 functions on Hilbert spaces. We also refer to [10] for a
version of the Whitney Extension Theorem for C 1 functions on some Banach
spaces (including Hilbert spaces).

Le Gruyer also shows in [9] that the extension F satisﬁes

Lip(∇F ) = Γ(F, ∇F, H) = Γ(f, G, E).

Our purpose in this paper is to solve an analogous problem for con-
vex functions. In a very recent paper [2], by introducing a new condition
(CW 1,1), see Deﬁnition 1.1 below, we gave a satisfactory solution to this
problem for convex functions of the class C 1,1(Rn) (in fact, for all the classes
C 1,ω(Rn), where ω is a modulus of continuity), with a good control of the
Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the extension in terms of that of G,
namely Lip(∇F ) ≤ c(n) Lip(G), where c(n) only depends on n (but tends to
inﬁnity with n). In this paper we generalize and improve this result for C 1,1
convex functions deﬁned on an arbitrary Hilbert space, showing in particu-
lar that those constants c(n) can be taken equal to 1. Nevertheless, it must
be observed that whereas the proofs in [2] (and of course the proof of the
C 1,1 version of the Whitney Extension Theorem too) are constructive, the
proofs of Le Gruyer’s Theorem in [9] and of the main result in the present
paper (which is strongly inspired by that of Le Gruyer’s) are not, as they
both rely on an application of Zorn’s lemma.

Deﬁnition 1.1. We will say that a pair of functions f : E → R, G : E → H
deﬁned on a subset E ⊂ H, satisﬁes condition (CW 1,1) on E provided that
there exists a constant M > 0 with

f (x) − f (y) − hG(y), x − yi ≥

1
2M

kG(x) − G(y)k2

(CW 1,1)

for all x, y ∈ E.

Remark 1.2. If (f, G) satisﬁes (CW 1,1) on E, then

f (x) ≥ f (y) + hG(y), x − yi

for all x, y ∈ E

and

x6=y, x,y∈E(cid:26) |f (x) − f (y) − hG(y), x − yi|

kx − yk2

sup

,

kG(x) − G(y)k

kx − yk

(cid:27) ≤ M.

In particular G is M -Lipschitz on E.

Proof. The ﬁrst inequality is obvious. For the second one, given x, y ∈ E,
the condition (CW 1,1) gives us the inequalities:

f (x) − f (y) − hG(y), x − yi ≥

1
2M

kG(x) − G(y)k2

and

f (y) − f (x) − hG(x), y − xi ≥

2M

kG(y) − G(x)k2,

the sum of which yields

hG(x) − G(y), x − yi ≥

1
M

kG(x) − G(y)k2,

which in turn implies kG(x) − G(y)k ≤ M kx − yk. On the other hand, using
again (CW 1,1) we obtain

0 ≤ f (x) − f (y) − hG(y), x − yi ≤ hG(y) − G(x), y − xi.

The desired inequality follows by combining the last one with the fact that
G is M -Lipschitz on E.
(cid:3)

The main result of this paper is as follows.

Theorem 1.3. Let E be a subset of H and f : E → R, G : E → H be two
functions. Then there exists a convex function F of class C 1,1(H) such that
F = f and ∇F = G on E if and only if (f, G) satisﬁes condition (CW 1,1)
on E. Moreover, if M > 0 is as in Deﬁnition 1.1, then F can be taken such
that (F, ∇F ) also satisﬁes (CW 1,1) on H with the same constant M.

Equivalently, bearing in mind Remark 1.2, Theorem 1.3 can be reformu-

lated in terms of the Lipschitz constant as follows.

Theorem 1.4. Let E be a subset of H, f : E → R be a function and
G : E → H a Lipschitz mapping. A necessary and suﬃcient condition on
the pair (f, G) for the existence of a convex function F of class C 1,1(H) such
that F = f and ∇F = G on E is that (f, G) satisﬁes condition (CW 1,1) on
E with M = Lip(G). In addition, if this condition is met, F can be taken
such that Lip(∇F ) = Lip(G).

2. Proof of Theorem 1.3

2.1. Necesity. The necessity of condition (CW 1,1) in Theorem 1.3 follows
from the following Proposition.

Proposition 2.1. Let f ∈ C 1,1(H) be convex. Then

f (x) − f (y) − h∇f (y), x − yi ≥

1
2M

k∇f (x) − ∇f (y)k2

for all x, y ∈ H, where

M = M (∇f, H) = sup

x,y∈H, x6=y

k∇f (x) − ∇f (y)k

kx − yk

.

Proof. Suppose that there exist diﬀerent points x, y ∈ H such that

f (x) − f (y) − h∇f (y), x − yi <

1
2M

k∇f (x) − ∇f (y)k2,

and we will get a contradiction.
Case 1. Assume further that M = 1, f (y) = 0, and ∇f (y) = 0. By
convexity this implies f (x) ≥ 0. Then we have

0 ≤ f (x) <

k∇f (x)k2.

DANIEL AZAGRA AND CARLOS MUDARRA

Call a = k∇f (x)k > 0, b = f (x), set

and deﬁne

v = −

1

k∇f (x)k

∇f (x),

ϕ(t) = f (x + tv)

for every t ∈ R. We have ϕ(0) = b, ϕ′(0) = −a, and ϕ′ is 1-Lipschitz. This
implies that

|ϕ(t) − b + at| ≤

t2
2

for every t ∈ R+, hence also that

ϕ(t) ≤ −at + b +

t2
2

for all t ∈ R+,

By assumption we have b < 1

2 a2, and therefore

f (x + av) = ϕ (a) ≤ −a2 + b +

a2
2

< 0,

which is in contradiction with the assumptions that f is convex, f (y) = 0,
and ∇f (y) = 0. This shows that

f (x) ≥

1
2

k∇f (x)k2.

Case 2. Assume only that M = 1. Deﬁne

g(z) = f (z) − f (y) − h∇f (y), z − yi

for every z ∈ H. Then g(y) = 0 and ∇g(y) = 0. By Case 1, we get

g(x) ≥

1
2

k∇g(x)k2,

and since ∇g(x) = ∇f (x)− ∇f (y) the Proposition is thus proved in the case
when M = 1.
Case 3. In the general case, we may assume M > 0 (the result is trivial
for M = 0). Consider ψ = 1
M f , which satisﬁes the assumption of Case 2.
Therefore

1
2
which is equivalent to the desired inequality.

ψ(x) − ψ(y) − h∇ψ(y), x − yi ≥

k∇ψ(x) − ∇ψ(y)k2,

(cid:3)

2.2. Suﬃciency. Now we assume that (f, G) satisﬁes condition (CW 1,1) on
the set E ⊂ H with constant M > 0. If we prove that for any x ∈ H \ E there

exist zx ∈ R and Zx ∈ H such that the pair (ef , eG), deﬁned by ef = f, eG = G
on E and ef (x) = zx, eG(x) = Zx, satisﬁes (CW 1,1) on E ∪ {x} with the

same constant M, then Zorn’s Lemma will imply the existence of a pair
(F, ˜∇F ) satisfying (CW 1,1) on H with constant M. Hence by Remark 1.2,
F will be a convex function of class C 1,1(H) such that F = f, ∇F = G on

C 1,1 CONVEX EXTENSIONS OF CONVEX FUNCTIONS

E and Lip(∇F ) ≤ M , and this simultaneously will complete the proofs of
Theorems 1.3 and 1.4.

To sum up, our only assumption is

(2.1) f (b) − f (a) − hG(a), b − ai ≥

1
2M

kG(a) − G(b)k2

for all a, b ∈ E,

and we have to show that for every x ∈ H \ E there exist f (x) ∈ R and
G(x) ∈ H (denoted above by zx and Zx respectively) such that

f (x) − f (a) − hG(a), x − ai ≥

f (a) − f (x) − hG(x), a − xi ≥

1
2M
1
2M

kG(x) − G(a)k2

and

kG(x) − G(a)k2

for all a ∈ E.

Note that these conditions are equivalent to

f (x) ≥ f (a) + hG(a), x − ai +

f (x) ≤ f (b) − hG(x), b − xi −

1
2M
1
2M

kG(x) − G(a)k2 and

kG(x) − G(b)k2

for all a, b ∈ E.

If we prove the existence of a vector G(x) ∈ H such that

s(x) := sup

≤ I(x) := inf

a∈E(cid:18)f (a) + hG(a), x − ai +
b∈E(cid:18)f (b) − hG(x), b − xi −

1
2M

kG(x) − G(a)k2(cid:19)
kG(x) − G(b)k2(cid:19) ,

1
2M

then it will be enough for us to take f (x) as any number in the interval
[s(x), I(x)].

In what follows we will essentially keep Le Gruyer’s notation because,
although our numbers αa,b, βa,b, Φ((a, b), (c, d)), etc, are diﬀerent from Le
Gruyer’s, they will play a similar role in the proof. Inspired by a strategy in
Le Gruyer’s proof of [9, Theorem 2.6], we will express the condition s(x) ≤
I(x) in the following way.

Lemma 2.2. The inequality s(x) ≤ I(x) is equivalent to

kG(x) − Za,bk2 ≤ αa,b + βa,b,

for all a, b ∈ E,

where

αa,b := M(cid:16)f (b) − f (a) − hG(a), b − ai(cid:17) − 1
βa,b :=(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 1

2(cid:16)G(b) − G(a) + M (x − b)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
2(cid:16)G(a) + G(b) + M (x − b)(cid:17).

Za,b := 1

2

,

2 kG(a) − G(b)k2,

Proof. We have that s(x) ≤ I(x) if and only if, for all a, b ∈ E,

f (a)+hG(a), x−ai+

kG(x)−G(a)k2 ≤ f (b)−hG(x), b−xi−

Multiplying by M we have that

Applying the Paralelogram Law to the left-side term we obtain

Note that, by condition (2.1), the number αa,b of Lemma 2.2 is nonneg-

ative. This allows us to introduce the radii ra,b := pαa,b + βa,b and the

closed balls Ba,b := B (Za,b, ra,b) centered at Za,b and radius ra,b, for every
(a, b) ∈ E2. Hence Lemma 2.2 shows that our problem can be reduced to
showing that

\(a,b)∈E

Ba,b 6= ∅,

because in this case it would be enough to take G(x) as any point in
Ba,b. In fact, thanks to the weak compactness of the closed balls

T(a,b)∈E

in H, this is equivalent to prove

\(a,b)∈F

Ba,b 6= ∅ for every ﬁnite subset F ⊂ E.

Thus, from now on we may and do assume that E is ﬁnite. We now introduce
some new notations:
Φ((a, b), (c, d)) := r2
γ1(a) := G(a),

c,d − kZa,bk2 − kZc,dk2

γ2(a) := G(a) + M (x − a)

(a, b), (c, d) ∈ E2,

for all a ∈ E.

a,b + r2

for all

As in Le Gruyer’s proof of [9, Theorem 2.6], a crucial step consists in showing
an inequality concerning Φ((a, b), (c, d)) and the funcions γ1, γ2.

Lemma 2.3. For every (a, b), (c, d) ∈ E2 we have

Φ((a, b), (c, d)) ≥ −hγ1(a), γ2(d)i − hγ1(c), γ2(b)i.

Proof. Using that

αa,b = M(cid:16)f (b) − f (a) − hG(a), b − ai(cid:17) − 1
αc,d = M(cid:16)f (d) − f (c) − hG(c), d − ci(cid:17) − 1

2 kG(a) − G(b)k2 and
2 kG(c) − G(d)k2

we obtain

αa,b + αc,d

= M(cid:16)f (d) − f (a) − hG(a), d − ai(cid:17) − 1
+ M(cid:16)f (b) − f (c) − hG(c), b − ci(cid:17) − 1
+ M(cid:16)hG(a), d − bi + hG(c), b − di(cid:17)(=: δ1)

2 kG(c) − G(b)k2(= αc,b)

+

1

= αa,d + αc,b + δ1 + δ2.

Of course, because (a, d), (c, b) ∈ E2, condition (2.1) implies that αa,d, αc,b ≥
0. As for δ1, we have that

δ1 = M hG(a) − G(c), d − bi.

8

DANIEL AZAGRA AND CARLOS MUDARRA

Computing term by term in δ2 we obtain

δ2 =

1

2(cid:18) − kG(a)k2 − kG(b)k2 + 2hG(a), G(b)i − kG(c)k2 − kG(d)k2 + 2hG(c), G(d)i
+ kG(a)k2 + kG(d)k2 − 2hG(a), G(d)i + kG(c)k2 + kG(b)k2 − 2hG(c), G(b)i(cid:19)

= hG(a), G(b)i + hG(c), G(d)i − hG(a), G(d)i − hG(c), G(b)i.

Claim 2.4. We have that

δ1 + δ2 = −hγ1(a), γ2(d)i − hγ1(c), γ2(b)i + hγ1(a), γ2(b)i + hγ1(c), γ2(d)i.

Indeed, computing the term in the right side we obtain

= −hG(a), G(d) − hG(b), G(c)i + hG(a), G(b)i + hG(c), G(d)i

−DG(a), G(d) + M (x − d)E −DG(c), G(b) + M (x − b)E
+DG(a), G(b) + M (x − b)E +DG(c), G(d) + M (x − d)E
+ M(cid:16) − hG(c), x − bi − hG(a), x − di + hG(a), x − bi + hG(c), x − di(cid:17)
= δ2 + M(cid:16)hG(c), b − di + hG(a), d − bi(cid:17) = δ2 + δ1,

and this proves our Claim.
On the other hand we note that

γ2(b) − γ1(a) = G(b) − G(a) + M (x − b),

and therefore

βa,b =(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 1

2(cid:16)G(b) − G(a) + M (x − b)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

Similarly we have βc,d =(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) γ1(c)−γ2(d)

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

(2.2)

γ1(a) + γ2(b) = G(a) + G(b) + M (x − b) = 2Za,b

and γ1(c) + γ2(d) = 2Zc,d. These equations show that

Finally, by using ﬁrst Claim 2.4 and then the preceding equation we deduce

Φ((a, b), (c, d)) = αa,b + αc,d + βa,b + βc,d − kZa,bk2 − kZc,dk2

= αa,d + αc,b + δ1 + δ2 + βa,b + βc,d − kZa,bk2 − kZc,dk2
≥ δ1 + δ2 + βa,b + βc,d − kZa,bk2 − kZc,dk2
= −hγ1(a), γ2(d)i − hγ1(c), γ2(b)i.

In order to establish that T(a,b)∈E 2 Ba,b 6= ∅ we ﬁrst have to study the

situation in which at least one of the balls of this family is a singleton.

Lemma 2.5. Suppose that there is (a, b) ∈ E2 with ra,b = 0. Then

(cid:3)

\(c,d)∈E 2

Bc,d = {Za,b}

and, in particular, the intersection is nonempty.

Proof. The hyphotesis ra,b = 0 in particular implies that

γ1(a) = G(a) = G(b) + M (x − b) = γ2(b).

Because 2Za,b = γ1(a) + γ2(b) (see equation (2.2)) we have that Za,b = γ1(a)
and similarly 2Zc,d = γ1(c) + γ2(d). Combining this with the inequality of
Lemma 2.3 we deduce, for all (c, d) ∈ E2,

Φ((a, b), (c, d)) ≥ −hγ1(a), γ2(d)i − hγ1(c), γ2(b)i = −hγ1(a), γ1(c) + γ2(d)i

= −2hγ1(a), Zc,di = −2hZa,b, Zc,di.

On the other hand, by deﬁnition of Φ we have

Φ((a, b), (c, d)) = r2

c,d −kZa,bk2 −kZc,dk2 = r2

c,d −kZa,b −Zc,dk2 −2hZa,b, Zc,di,

and by plugging the last inequality in this expression we easily obtain

kZa,b − Zc,dk2 ≤ r2
c,d

for all

(c, d) ∈ E2.

(cid:3)

Since the preceding Lemma covers the case ra,b = 0 for some (a, b) ∈ E2,
we may suppose from this moment on that ra,b > 0 for all (a, b) ∈ E2. Recall
that we are also assuming that E is ﬁnite. The following Lemma is essentially
a restatement (for P a ﬁnite set and replacing Rn with a Hilbert space) of
[4, 2.10.40, p. 199], whose proof obviously extends for balls in Hilbert spaces
if we bear in mind that they are compact in the weak topology.

Lemma 2.6 (Kirszbraun). For every λ ≥ 0, we denote Ba,b(λ) = B(Za,b, λra,b).
Deﬁne λ0 ≥ 0 as

λ0 := inf(cid:26)λ ≥ 0 : \(a,b)∈E 2

Ba,b(λ) 6= ∅(cid:27).

Then T(a,b)∈E 2 Ba,b(λ0) = {Z0}, where
Z0 ∈ co(cid:8)Za,b : (a, b) ∈ E2

and

kZ0 − Za,bk = λ0ra,b(cid:9) .

We will ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.3 by establishing the following.

Lemma 2.7. With the notation of Lemma 2.6, the number λ0 satisﬁes λ0 ≤
(a, b) ∈ E2} has nonempty
1. In particular, the family of balls {Ba,b
intersection.

:

Proof. If we deﬁne E = {(a, b) ∈ E2 : kZ0 − Za,bk = λ0ra,b}, from Lemma
2.6 we learn that
(2.3)

ξa,b = 1,

ξa,b ≥ 0

for all

(a, b) ∈ E.

Z0 = X(a,b)∈E

By these properties we have that

ξa,bZa,b with X(a,b)∈E
ξa,b(Z0 − Za,b) = X(c,d)∈E
X(a,b)∈E
X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

and therefore

(2.4)

ξa,bξc,dhZ0 − Za,b, Z0 − Zc,di = 0.

ξc,d(Z0 − Zc,d) = 0,

For any (a, b), (c, d) ∈ E we have that kZa,b − Z0k2 = λ2

0r2

a,b and kZc,d −

Z0k2 = λ2

0r2

c,d, and it is also clear that

kZa,b − Zc,dk2 = kZa,b − Z0k2 + kZc,d − Z0k2 − 2hZ0 − Za,b, Z0 − Zc,di.

Hence, multiplying by ξa,bξc,d, taking sums over (a, b), (c, d) ∈ E and using
(2.4) we obtain

ξa,bξc,dkZa,b − Zc,dk2 = λ2

ξa,bξc,d(r2

a,b + r2

c,d),

0 X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

Now we set

∆ : = X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

ξa,bξc,d(cid:0)−kZa,b − Zc,dk2 + r2

a,b + r2

c,d(cid:1)

= (1 − λ2

c,d).

Since all the radii ra,b are positive, it is clear that showing λ0 ≤ 1 is equiva-
lent to ∆ ≥ 0

Claim 2.8. ∆ ≥ 0.

We inmediately see that

∆ = X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

ξa,bξc,d(cid:0)−kZa,bk2 − kZc,dk2 + r2

a,b + r2

c,d(cid:1)+2 X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

On the other hand, by (2.3) we obtain

ξa,bξc,d Φ((a, b), (c, d)).

ξa,bξc,dhZa,b, Zc,di.

kZ0k2 = X(a,b), (c,d)∈E
∆ = 2kZ0k2 + X(a,b), (c,d)∈E
Γ1 := X(a,b)∈E
Γ1 + Γ2 = X(a,b)∈E
ξa,bξc,d Φ((a, b), (c, d)) ≥ − X(a,b), (c,d)∈E

ξa,bγ1(a), Γ2 := X(a,b)∈E
ξa,b(γ1(a) + γ2(b)) = 2 X(a,b)∈E

ξa,bγ2(b)

ξa,bZa,b = 2Z0.

ξa,bξc,d(cid:16)hγ1(a), γ2(d)i + hγ1(c), γ2(b)i(cid:17)

ξa,bγ1(a), X(c,d)∈E

ξc,dγ2(d)E − D X(c,d)∈E

ξc,dγ1(c), X(a,b)∈E

ξa,bγ2(b)E

This implies that

(2.5)

We deﬁne now

(2.6)

X(a,b), (c,d)∈E
= −D X(a,b)∈E

and we easily deduce from equation (2.2) that

Applying Lemma 2.3 we obtain

= −hΓ1, Γ2i − hΓ1, Γ2i = −2hΓ1, Γ2i.

Combining this inequality with equations (2.5) and (2.6) we have

∆ ≥ 2(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

,

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

which implies ∆ ≥ 0. This ﬁnishes the proof of Claim 2.8, and therefore that
of Lemma 2.7 too.
(cid:3)

The proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 are now complete.
