Spin-Glass Models is avoided and transformed into a dynamical crossover. Approaching the ideal
critical point the perturbative loop expansion of the theory is divergent at all orders and I show
that the leading term at any given order is the same of a dynamical stochastic equation, called
Stochastic-Beta-Relaxation (SBR) in EPL 106, 56003 (2014). At variance with the original theory
SBR can be studied non-perturbatively unveiling the avoided nature of the transition and yielding a
description of the dynamical crossover. It is therefore important to establish the connection between
the dynamical ﬁeld theory and SBR beyond perturbation theory. This can be done with the help
of a stronger result according to which the dynamical ﬁeld theory is exactly equivalent to a theory
with quenched disorder. Qualitatively the non-perturbative mechanism leading to the crossover is
therefore the same of SBR. Quantitatively SBR corresponds to make the mean-ﬁeld approximation
once the quenched disorder has been generated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In a recent publication [1] I have introduced a dynamical stochastic equation, called Sotchastic-Beta-Relaxation, that
provides a characterization of the temperature region where dynamical arrest as predicted by ideal Mode-Coupling-
Theory (MCT) for supercooled liquids [2] and mean-ﬁeld discontinuous Spin-Glass (SG) Models [3–5] is avoided and
transformed into a dynamical crossover from relaxational to activated-like dynamics.

As a model of the glass crossover SBR is rather consistent and lack many of the drawbacks of earlier proposal to
amend ideal MCT. Ongoing studies of SBR are unveiling a rich phenomenology and a rather non-trivial characteriza-
tion of the qualitative and quantitative changes occurring at the glass crossover [6, 7], including notably a change in
the spatial structure of dynamical ﬂuctuations characterized by the appearance of strong Dynamical Heterogeneities
and violations of the Stokes-Einstein relationship. Another non-trivial feature is that the increase of the relaxation
time and dynamic susceptibility is accompanied by a decrease of the dynamical correlation length below the crossover
temperature [7], that challenges somehow the classic Adams and Gibbs [9] view that dynamic slowing down is es-
sentially driven by an ever increasing correlation length corresponding to the size of the Cooperatively Rearranging
Regions.

In order to fully appreciate the aforementioned properties one should acknowledge that SBR is not a phenomeno-
logical theory, more precisely the random ﬂuctuations of the temperature that represent its main feature are not
an ad hoc hypothesis but comes out from a rigorous and complex computation starting from clear and falsiﬁable
assumptions. As such SBR stands in a diﬀerent position compared to many theories in the ﬁeld of glassy systems
that are either explicitly phenomenological or at least very speculative. In this paper I present a complete discussion
of this point. The starting point of the argument is that both MCT and discontinuous SG (characterized by one
step of Parisi’s Replica-Symmetry-Breaking (1RSB) [10] ) obey G¨otze’s equation for the critical correlator. This is
a universal mean-ﬁeld equation in the sense that it is a polynomial (quadratic) equation with coeﬃcients that are
regular functions of the external parameters (temperature, pressure, magnetic ﬁeld, etc.). Landau theory suggests
that if the equation holds approaching the singularity then the region close to the would-be singularity itself should
be described by an eﬀective Hamiltonian (being in a dynamical context I ﬁnd it preferable to call it the eﬀective
theory/action) that is simpler than the original microscopic theory. As a ﬁrst guess the eﬀective theory can be de-
termined by integration of the mean-ﬁeld equation requiring that is extremised by its solutions. More precisely the
eﬀective theory is the most general polynomial of the order parameter of the required order (cubic in our case, because
G¨otze’s equation is quadratic) and with the symmetries of the original microscopic problem [35]. This is discussed in
section (II). In the ﬁrst subsection I introduce a ﬁeld-theoretical formulation of the dynamics in order to understand
the properties and symmetries of the order parameter and of the action. Here I discuss the so-called fast-motion (FM)
limit where dynamical correlations and thus the eﬀective theory acquire a Replica-Symmetric(RS)-like structure. In
the second subsection I discuss in more details the nature of dynamical arrest in MCT and 1RSB-SG. I recall the
standard arguments of Landau theory and the need to replace the critical mean-ﬁeld equations with an eﬀective
theory. I then argue that the eﬀective theory is RS-like in the FM limit but it retains this structure also in β-regime

2

where the correlations are not RS-like. In the last subsection the dynamical eﬀective theory is presented. Section
II is essentially introductory and deal mostly with already published work. The following sections are the body of
the paper and are devoted to the study of the GCT. In section III I study the GCT by means of a loop expansion.
I start with the mean-ﬁeld equation, exhibit the bare propagator and then study the Feynman diagrams. As usual,
approaching the ideal critical point each term in the loop expansion is found to be divergent and I demonstrate that
the leading term at any given order is the same of SBR thus providing a detailed proof of a statement that was
condensed in few lines in [1]. The discussion is carried on initially for the zero-dimensional case and it is generalized
to ﬁnite-dimensional systems in the last subsection. I note that the mapping to SBR is proven for all correlation
functions while in ([1]) only the average order parameter was mentioned. At variance with the original theory SBR
can be studied non-perturbatively unveiling the avoided nature of the transition and yielding a description of the
dynamical crossover. It is therefore important to establish the connection between the dynamical ﬁeld theory and
SBR beyond perturbation theory. This can be done with the help of a stronger result, presented in section IV, that
was not discussed in [1]. According to it the dynamical ﬁeld theory is exactly equivalent to a dynamical theory with
quenched disorder. Qualitatively the non-perturbative mechanism leading to the crossover is therefore the same of
SBR. Quantitatively SBR corresponds to make the mean-ﬁeld approximation once the quenched disorder has been
generated and the quality of this approximation depends on the value of a dimensionless constant. In short, section
II is where I lay down our basic assumption, i.e. the fact at the dynamical crossover G¨otze’s critical equation must
be replaced by the Glassy Critical Theory (GCT) deﬁned in eq. (31). Section III and IV present instead rigorous
results that follow from the assumption. In section V I give our conclusions.

II. GLASSY CRITICAL THEORY

A. Dynamical Field Theory

In order to determine the eﬀective theory for the glass crossover I introduce a ﬁeld-theoretical representation of

dynamics. I illustrate the method in the simplest case of a single variable q that obeys Langevin dynamics :

1
Γ0

˙q = −β

dH
dq

+ η , (cid:104)η(t)η(t(cid:48))(cid:105) =

δ(t − t(cid:48)) .

2
Γ0

(1)

The discussion can be easily generalized to systems with many degrees of freedom. In the standard framework [11–14]
one typically sets the initial time of dynamics to minus inﬁnity, here instead I want to compute averages of observables
O[q(t)] starting from an equilibrium initial conﬁguration at time t = 0:

(cid:90) (cid:89)(cid:20)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(cid:104)O(cid:105) ≡ 1
˜Z

dq(t)dG(η(t))δ

− 1
Γ0

˙q − β

dH
dq

+ η

O exp[−βH(q(0))]

(2)

where dG(η(t)) is the Gaussian measure over the thermal noise η [36]. The average over the initial condition implies
that the normalization constant ˜Z is the exactly the partition function. Rewriting the delta function in exponential
form by means of an auxiliary variable ˆq(t) we have:

(3)

(4)

where

(cid:90)

L =

(cid:104)O(cid:105) =

[dq(t)dˆq(t)]O exp[−L]

(cid:90) (cid:89)
(cid:0)ˆq ˙q − ˆq2(cid:1) + ˆqβ

1
Z

(cid:20) 1

Γ0

(cid:21)

dH
dq

+ βH(q(0))

The normalization constant Z is proportional to the partition function at initial time (times an irrelevant numerical
constant). Averages of observables involving the variable ˆq are associated to the response to perturbations of the form
∆H(t) = −h(t)q(t) for times larger than the initial condition (t > 0). For instance it can be easily checked that for:

R(t, t(cid:48)) ≡ δ(cid:104)q(t)(cid:105)
δh(t(cid:48))

= β(cid:104)q(t)ˆq(t(cid:48))(cid:105) t(cid:48) > 0

Responses to perturbation of the initial condition obey the standard Fluctuation-Dissipation-Theorem

R(t) ≡ d(cid:104)q(t)(cid:105)

dh(0)

= β(cid:104)q(t)q(0)(cid:105)c

(5)

(6)

For a generic distribution of the initial condition, causality implies that

R(t, t(cid:48)) = 0 , t(cid:48) > t .

Since the initial condition is equilibrated, correlation functions are time-translational invariant (TTI):

3

(7)

(8)
where C(s) = C(−s). Furthermore the Fluctuation-Dissipation-Theorem (FDT) implies that the response to a
perturbation acting on the initial condition and at all later times up to t(cid:48)(cid:48) < t is given by:

(cid:104)q(t)q(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = C(t − t(cid:48))

(cid:90) t(cid:48)(cid:48)

R(t) +

R(t, t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) = β(cid:104)q(t)q(t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105)c .

The above relationships combined imply:

0+

(cid:104)q(t)ˆq(t(cid:48))(cid:105) =

d

dt(cid:48)(cid:104)q(t(cid:48))q(t)(cid:105) = − ˙C(t − t(cid:48)) (t(cid:48) < t) .

General relationship (valid also for oﬀ-equilibrium initial conditions) in the above formalism are also:

ln(cid:82) exp[−L] = ln Z (the free energy at the initial time) depends only on h(0).

They can be proven computing the derivative of

(cid:104)ˆq(t)(cid:105) = 0 ,(cid:104)ˆq(t)ˆq(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 0 .

ln(cid:82) exp[−L] with respect to ﬁelds h(t) and noticing that
(cid:90)

(11)

(cid:90)

The part of the Lagrangian that depends explicitly on the Hamiltonian can be written in a compact form introducing

a novel cordinate η that has the properties of the product of two Grassmanian variables:

The variables q(t) and ˆq(t) can then be combined into a single variable parameterized by the coordinate a = (ta, ηa):

(9)

(10)

(12)

(13)

(14)

dη = 0 ,

η dη = 1 , η2 = 0

q(a) ≡ q(ta) + ηa ˆq(ta) .

Given a function A(a) ≡ A(ta, ηa), I deﬁne the integral over da as:

(cid:90)

(cid:90) tmax

0+

A(a)da ≡

A(ta, ηa)dηadta + A(0, 0)

where tmax is some maximal time over which we study dynamics whose precise value is irrelevant as long as it is larger
than the larger time separation we want to study. We can write the action as the sum of a kinetic term proportional
to 1/Γ0 and of a potential term:

(cid:90)

dt(cid:0)ˆq ˙q − ˆq2(cid:1) +

(cid:90)

L =

1
Γ0

da β H(q(a))

(15)

where I used δ(η) = η. Note that the generic product q(a)q(b) has four independent components but the various
relationships derived above imply that instead the components of its average can be expressed in terms of the sole
correlation function C(s):

(cid:104)q(a)q(b)(cid:105) = (cid:104)q(ta)q(tb)(cid:105) + (cid:104)q(ta)ˆq(tb)(cid:105)ηb + (cid:104)q(tb)ˆq(ta)(cid:105)ηa + (cid:104)ˆq(tb)ˆq(ta)(cid:105)ηaηb =

= C(|ta − tb|) − ˙C(ta − tb)θ(ta − tb)ηb − ˙C(tb − ta)θ(tb − ta)ηa

(16)

The above structure is very genereal: considering any two observables O1(q), O2(q) one can show that the correlation
(cid:104)O1(q(a))O2(q(b))(cid:105) takes the form of the r.h.s. of (16) with C(t) replaced by the correlation CO1O2(t).
I now introduce the so-called fast motion (FM) limit [13, 15]. In physical terms it amounts to study relaxational
dynamics on an inﬁnitely large timescale so that any two-time correlation (cid:104)q(t)q(t(cid:48))(cid:105) has relaxed to its inﬁnite-
time value limt→∞(cid:104)q(0)q(t)(cid:105). Formally this can be achieved by sending the parameter Γ0 to inﬁnity leading to an
extremely fast microscopic dynamics (hence the name fast motion) so that the memory of the initial condition is lost
instantaneously. One can argue that in the FM limit the time dependence of any two-time correlation is considerably

simpler, the correlation can take just two values depending if the two times are equal or diﬀerent. One can check by
a simple explicit computation that the form (16) becomes:

4

where the delta function is deﬁned with respect to the integral (14) as (cid:82) δ(ab)g(a)da = g(b) and takes the form

(cid:104)q(a)q(b)(cid:105) = δ(ab)(C(0) − C(∞)) + C(∞)

δ(ab) = δ(ta − tb)(ηa + ηb)Q0(ta)Q0(tb) + P0(ta)P0(tb) where the function P0(t) is deﬁned as being equal to one
if t = 0 and zero otherwise. The function Q0(t) is equal to 1 − P0(t) [37]. Higher orders correlations also have a
simpliﬁed structure, for instance a three-point correlation can take three possible values and takes the form:

(17)

(cid:104)q(a)q(b)q(c)(cid:105) = c0 + c1[δ(ab) + δ(ac) + δ(cb)] + c2δ(ab)δ(ac)

(18)

In general the value of an n-point correlation depends only on wheather some indexes coincide. This implies the
following general result: correlations in the FM limit have the same expression of replica-symmetric correlations in
a system of n replicas, where a, b = 1, . . . n, and δ(ab) is the Kronecker delta. I note that using this property one
can establish the connection between dynamics and statics. In particular for solvable models like mean-ﬁeld SG the
statics can be solved by the replica method and one can recover the same results within dynamics by taking the FM
limit [13, 15].

The connection between FM and replica symmetry follows from rather general arguments and holds also when
using Newtonian dynamics with Hamilton’s equations of motion.
In this case the only averaging occurs for the
initial condition, more precisely once the initial conﬁguration of the q is ﬁxed the Maxwell-Boltzmann average over
the momenta p at the initial time generate diﬀerent trajectories in analogy with the diﬀerent thermal histories in
Langevin dynamics. Let us introduce a ﬁeld-theoretical representation of Hamiltonian dynamics considering once
again a single degree of freedom q and its conjugate momentum p. The action (4) becomes for an Hamiltonian
H(q, p):

where Γ0 = 1 but can take any value if we rescale times. Using the same deﬁnitions for a and(cid:82) da introduced above,

+ βH(q(0), p(0))

+ ˆpβ

(19)

(ˆq ˙p − ˆp ˙q) + ˆqβ

dH
dq

L =

dt

we can deﬁne combined variables:

(cid:90)

(cid:20) β

Γ0

(cid:21)

and again decompose the dynamical action into a kinetic and a potential-like term:

q(a) ≡ q(ta) + ηa ˆq(ta) , p(a) ≡ p(ta) + ηa ˆp(ta) ,

(cid:90)

L =

(cid:90)

dt(ˆq ˙p − ˆp ˙q) +

da β H(q(a), p(a))

(20)

(21)

One can check that relationships (5, 6,10,11) hold in this formalism too and so does (16). The FM limit corresponds
to consider very large times scale or equivalently to have very fast microscopic dynamics i.e. sending Γ0 to inﬁnity
and again one can check that all dynamical correlations are RS-like.

B. Glassy Phase Transitions

Both mean-ﬁeld 1RSB-SG and MCT are characterized by phase transitions from a liquid phase to a glassy phase, the
order parameter being a two-time correlation. Although the order parameter is discontinuous, overall the transition is
second-order in nature, notably: i) the correlator displays a square-root singularity, ii) the correlation length diverges
and iii) dynamical ﬂuctuations are also divergent. All these features can be shown explicitly 1RSB-SG [3, 5].
In
both cases the correlations obey the so-called G¨otze’s equation for the critical correlator that displays a square root
singularity. Instead ﬂuctuations are not directly accessible in MCT but the presence of a diverging correlation length
can be demonstrated within Inhomogeneous MCT (IMCT) i.e. studying the response to spatially inhomogenenous
external parameters [16].

MCT and 1RSB-SG are mean-ﬁeld in the sense that the average order parameter near the critical temperature
obeys a polynomial equation with coeﬃcients that are regular functions of the external parameter. To illustrate this
point let us consider the glassy phase, here things are simpler because one can forget about dynamics and study the
long time limit of the correlator. One ﬁnds that it obeys a quadratic equation of the form τ + q2 = 0 where τ vanishes
linearly at the critical temperature and q is the diﬀerence with the value of the correlator ar τ = 0. The equation
leads to the square-root singularity of the solution and is completely general. In particular it does not depend on

the precise nature of the approximations we made: whenever we deal with an approximate closed equation for the
averaged order parameter we will obtain the square-root singularity i.e. mean-ﬁeld behavior.

According to the modern theory of phase transitions the mean-ﬁeld critical exponents can be altered by long-
wavelength ﬂuctuations below the upper critical dimension. This imply that every mean-ﬁeld prediction (including
those of MCT) should be tested against these ﬂuctuations. Within Landau theory one can argue that this problem
can be studied considering an eﬀective Hamiltonian/action for the long-wavelength ﬂuctuations that depends on few
coupling constants. The eﬀective action is a simple polynomial of the order parameter with the symmetries of the
original problem and that is extremized by the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation of state.

5

Let us apply the previous consideration to 1RSB-SG and supercooled liquids. In general the long-wavelength order
parameter is deﬁned in terms of the Fourier transform of the microscopic order parameter at small momenta. In
Spin-Glasses one typically considers the Fourier transform of the microscopic overlap at diﬀerent times:

sx(t)sx(t(cid:48))eipx .

(22)

Q(p, t, t(cid:48)) ≡(cid:88)

x

(cid:90)

In supercooled liquids the natural order parameter is the density-density correlator at diﬀerent times deﬁned as

where the density ﬂuctuations are deﬁned as δρ(x, t) ≡(cid:80)

Φ(p, ∆, t, t(cid:48)) ≡

dDxδρ(x, t)δρ(x + ∆, t)eipx

(23)
i δ(x − xi(t)) − ρ where xi(t) label the position of particle i

at time t. The space coordinate x lies on a lattice for SG systems while it is continuous in liquids.

In both mean-ﬁeld 1RSB-SG and MCT near the critical temperature the correlator is concentrated near a system-
dependent plateau value on the time-scale of the β regime. The deviations from the plateau value in the β regime are
small and critical and they should be identiﬁed with the critical order parameter whose behavior is described by the
eﬀective theory on long wavelengths. Within MCT (but the same scenario is obtained within other treatments [17])
the critical order parameter is actually the projection of the distance from the plateau on a system-dependent critical
mode ˜H∆:

Q(p, t, t(cid:48)) ≈ qδ(p) + g(p, t, t(cid:48)) Φ(p, ∆, t, t(cid:48)) ≈ F∆δ(p) + ˜H∆ gp(t, t(cid:48))

(24)
and the problem is to determine the eﬀective theory obeyed by g(p, t, t(cid:48)) in order to compute the average order
parameter:

Q(p, t, t(cid:48)) ≈ qδ(p) + (cid:104)g(p, t, t(cid:48))(cid:105) Φ(p, ∆, t, t(cid:48)) ≈ ˜F∆δ(p) + ˜H∆ (cid:104)gp(t, t(cid:48))(cid:105)

(25)

Fourier transform of the previous expression with respect to the real space variable ∆ leads to the MCT expression

(cid:104)δρk(t)δρ−k+p(t(cid:48))(cid:105) ≈ Fkδ(p) + Hk (cid:104)gp(t, t(cid:48))(cid:105) .

(26)

From higher order powers of (24) one obtains that higher orders connected correlations are also expressed near the
critical temperature as averages of the critical ﬁeld

(cid:104)Q(p, t, t(cid:48)) . . . Q(p(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105)c ≈ (cid:104)g(p, t, t(cid:48)) . . . g(p(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105)c

(cid:104)δρk(t)δρk+p(t(cid:48)) . . . δρk(cid:48)(t(cid:48)(cid:48))δρk(cid:48)+p(cid:48)(t(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105)c ≈ (cid:104)g(p, t, t(cid:48)) . . . g(p(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105)c Hk . . . Hk(cid:48)

(27)

(28)

The above relationships hold at large distances, i.e. for small values of p while the typical k’s are those of the static
structure factor. A description in terms of an eﬀective theory is valid provided the order parameter is small and
this explain why the present treatment focus on the β regime.
I recall that in order to have small deviations of
the order parameter one needs to consider large enough wavelengths corresponding to p small, indeed deviations on
large p are local and therefore large. The underlying assumption behind Landau theory is that once short-distance
ﬂuctuations are integrated out the eﬀective theory for the long-wavelength ﬂuctuation takes a simple polynomial form.
For instance in the Curie-Weiss model the local spins are Ising and thus have a strongly non-linear distribution while
the total magnetization becomes Gaussian in the thermodynamic limit.

In the ﬁeld-theoretical description of dynamics of the previous section the order parameter can be written as Q(ab)
(I will ﬁrst remove the p-dependence by considering the zero-dimensional case, space-dependence will be reintroduced
later). Let us start considering the eﬀective action in the FM limit. As we saw before, in this limit all dynamical
correlations must assume a RS-like structure, therefore the eﬀective action in the FM limit must be also RS-like.
Furthermore the physics of the problem tells us that the correlator at equal times is not critical, in particular in

6

the context of supercooled liquids this follows from the known fact that the static structure factor Sk is regular as a
function of the temperature while the ergodicity breaking parameter Fk displays a square-root singularity. We can
thus set the ﬂuctuations of Q(aa) to zero imposing without loss of generality Q(aa) = 0. No other symmetries should
be imposed and thus we identify the eﬀective theory with the generic replica-symmetric theory with Q(aa) = 0, this
will be written explicitly below, see expression (31).

The critical properties of this theory in the replica formalism (i.e. when a, b = 1, . . . , n) have been studied in [18].
Unexpectedly it turned out that at all orders in the loop expansion the critical properties of the theory are the same
of a quadratic stochastic equation that is ill-deﬁned beyond perturbation theory. In the following I will also derive
again this result diagrammatically. Within the diagrammatic treatment one can see that the very same mapping to
an ill-deﬁned static stochastic equation holds for dynamics in the FM limit. Indeed in the FM limit all objects are
RS-like and the only diﬀerence between dynamics and replicas occur when we perform integrals over the indexes, but

since we have(cid:82) da = 1 in both cases the result is exactly the same.

As discussed in [1] and [8] in order to obtain a well-deﬁned theory near the avoided singularity one must abandon
the FM limit and consider dynamics on a ﬁnite albeit large timescale, i.e. the β regime. On a ﬁnite time-scale the
action must contain terms depending on 1/Γ0 that break the RS-like structure of the dynamical theory and restore
time ordering leading to a correlation C(t) that is a non-trivial function of time. This can be checked explicitly in
mean-ﬁeld SG models [13, 15]. For this reason is highly non trivial the fact that we can study dynamics in the β
regime using the very same RS-like eﬀective action valid in the FM limit, i.e. without the Γ0-dependent terms. This
is because it was shown in [15] that the mean-ﬁeld dynamical equations in the FM limit admit also non-FM solutions
describing the time evolution of the correlator in the β regime. When written in terms of a dynamical correlator the
equations becomes identical to G¨otze’s equation for the critical correlator thus supporting the assumption that the
GCT is the Landau theory corresponding to MCT. All these technical results will be discussed again in details in
the following section. Therefore it should be clear that the connection between MCT and SBR does not begin at
the microscopic level, but at the level of the MCT equation for the critical correlator. The absence of the Γ0 terms
leads to a spurious time-scale invariance of the theory that can be removed by matching arguments. This time-scale
invariance is a well-known feature of the MCT critical correlator.

C. The Action and the Order Parameter

In this section I deﬁne the mathematical problem I will address in this paper. I consider an order parameter that

is a symmetric two-index object Q(ab) = Q(ba) such that

(cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) ≡ 1
Z

Q(aa) = 0

 Q(ab) . . . Q(cd) exp[−L]

dQ(ab)

(cid:90) (cid:89)

(ab)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:19)

(da db dc dd)Q(ab)Q(cd)

and I want to compute a generic average of the order parameter of the form:

Where the zero-dimensional GCT is deﬁned as:

(cid:18)

(cid:90)

L =

6

w2

(da db)Q3(ab) .

(cid:90)

(29)

(30)

(31)

The coupling constants obey various constraints [38]. The normalization constant Z guarantees that (cid:104)1(cid:105) = 1. Formally
the same action describes the static and dynamical problem, the main diﬀerence being in the nature of the order
parameter Q(ab). An important diﬀerence is that in the dynamical case we need an additional prescription in order
to make the problem of computing averages (30) with action (31) well-deﬁned. I will discuss this point later in the
context of the mean-ﬁeld equation. I note that the symmetries of the action allow the presence of other types of cubic
terms [19] but they are irrelevant for the ﬁnal result as will be brieﬂy discussed in the appendix.
In the static treatment [18, 20] the indexes label
diﬀerent replicas a = 1, . . . , n, and the limit n → 1 must be taken at the end of the computation. As a consequence
the order parameter is a n×n symmetric real-valued matrix. In the dynamical formalism the indexes a and the integral

objects. In the static case the average order parameter is naturally a RS matrix described by a single scalar q(ab) = q,
q(aa) = 0. In the dynamical case we expect on physical grounds that the average order parameter obeys TTI and
FDT and therefore it is parameterized by the form (16) with a function C(t) such that C(0) = 0. In the static case
it is clear that the action is invariant under permutations of the replica indexes and the RS solution is an invariant
too. In the dynamical case by analogy I will deﬁne a matrix Q(ab) with the structure (16) an invariant. In the next
section I will show that the invariant nature of the average order parameter can be proven perturbatively: ﬁrst one
shows that at the mean-ﬁeld level the average can be described by an invariant, then one shows that corrections to
the mean-ﬁeld expression preserve the invariant character at all orders. It is likely that a non perturbative proof can
be found but I leave this for future work [39] In the following we will also use a notion of generalized invariant that
apply to objects that depends on any number of indexes (a, . . . , c). In the replica case it is just a RS tensor while in
the dynamical case the extension is deﬁned in the appendix.

A property of any invariant matrix q(ab) with q(aa) = 0 that will be crucial in the following developments is the

following

(cid:90)

da q(ab) = 0

(32)

In the replica treatment the invariant is RS (q(ab) = q) and the result is just (n − 1)q that vanishes for n = 1. In
dynamics the physical origin of the condition can be traced back to FDT and TTI, at any rate it can be proven
starting from the structure (16) and of C(0) = 0 and it is discussed in the appendix [40]. There are many properties

( e.g. (cid:82) da = 1) like (32) that hold both in the replicated and dynamical formalism (also beyond FM) and allow a

parallel treatment of the two problems. At the technical level this the key to the solution of the dynamical problem.

III. THE LOOP EXPANSION

In this section I will discuss the computation of the averages (30) by means of a loop expansion. I will ﬁrst study the
problem at the mean-ﬁeld level, then study the bare propagator and ﬁnally setup the diagrammatic loop expansion
to compute systematically corrections to mean-ﬁeld. I will then show that the mapping to SBR holds at all orders
for the most diverging term. In the end I will generalize the results to ﬁnite dimension adding a gradient term to the
GCT. I will discuss at the same time the replica and dynamical case. In dynamics the action will be expanded around
the the non-FM solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation of state corresponding to the equation for the critical correlator of
MCT, therefore the equivalence with the replica computation of [18] is lost because the dynamical correlations do not
have the RS-like form (e.g. expression (17) and (18) do not hold) and one must carry each step of the computation
anew.

A. The Mean-Field Solution

The mean-ﬁeld value q(ab) of the average order parameter is given by the solution of the equation ∂L/∂q = 0:

(cid:90)

0 = −τ + m2

(cid:90)

dc[q(ac) + q(bc)] + 2 m3

(dc dd)q(cd) − w1(q2)(ab) − w2 q2(ab)

(33)

The above equation is valid for a (cid:54)= b, and in the summation over the indexes we must recall that q(aa) = 0 [41]. The
equation admits invariant solutions and we will restrict the discussion to them. As a consequence, because of the
property (32) the terms depending on m2 and m3 will not contribute. In the replica treatment the above equation
for a RS solution q(ab) = q reduces to

0 = −τ + 2m2(n − 1)q + 2 m3n(n − 1)q − w1(n − 2)q2 − w2q2

giving for n = 1 and positive values of τ [42]

(cid:114) τ

w1 − w2

.

q =

(34)

(35)

Thus the static treatment at the mean-ﬁeld level implies the existence of a glassy solution for τ > 0 characterized by
a squared root singularity at the critical value τ = 0. In the dynamic case an invariant q(ab) is parameterized by a

real-valued function of time C(t) and the equation can be rewritten as an equation for C(t). As shown in [15] and
explained in the appendix the equation reads:

τ = −w2 C 2(t) + w1

d
dt

C(t − t(cid:48))C(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)

(36)

(cid:90) t

8

(38)

This is the well-known G¨otze equation for the critical correlator in Mode-Coupling-Theory. An important feature of
this equation is that it is time-scale invariant, in the sense that if C(t) is a solution, C(s t) is also a solution for any
real s. Thus strictly speaking the mathematical problem deﬁned by eqs. (31) and (30) is ill-deﬁned dynamically: we
have a family of solutions related by a rescaling of time and we need a prescription to choose one of them. I will
consider the following prescription: The action (and thus the mean-ﬁeld equation) contains additional hidden terms
that aﬀect the small-time behavior of the solution leading to the condition

C(t)ta = 1

lim
t→0

(37)

where the value one is conventional (it can be replaced by any constant through a rescaling of time), but it is crucial
that it does not depend on τ . The prescription can be justiﬁed in physical systems with reference to the previous
section. The hidden terms are those proportional to 1/Γ0 that appear when we abandon the fast motion limit. They
are important for the dynamics at small times but on the time-scale of the β regime their only role is to remove the
time-scale invariance. On the other hand since the precise form of the 1Γ0 terms is irrelevant it is also clear that the
precise nature of microscopic dynamics (Langevin vs. Hamiltonian) is also irrelevant.

Le us recall the main properties of the solution of equation (36). Depending on the sign of τ we have:

C(t) =(cid:112)|τ|/w1 g±(t/τβ) ,

(cid:90) t

where the undetermined constant τβ encodes the time-scale invariance of the solution. The two functions g±(t) obey
the following equation

± 1 = −λ g2±(t) +

d
dt

g±(t − t(cid:48))g±(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)

(39)
were the so-called parameter exponent is given by λ = w2/w1 [15, 22]. The functions g±(t) diverges as 1/ta for t → 0.
√
1 − λ while g−(t) goes to minus
In the large time limit they behave diﬀerently, g+(t) goes to the constant value 1/
inﬁnity as −tb. The exponents a and b are determined by the well-known expression

0

Γ2(1 − a)
Γ(1 − 2a)

λ =

=

Γ2(1 + b)
Γ(1 + 2b)

.

(40)

I recall that the above relationship implies additional constraints on w2/w1 [43] Note that the divergence of the
correlator g±(t) at small times can be considered again a spurious consequence of time-scale invariance and indeed it
is ﬁxed by the presence of the 1/Γ0 terms.

The above prescription in order to choose a unique C(t) allows to express τβ as a function of τ leading to the

well-known MCT scaling law:

τβ = t0

1
τ 1

2 a

(41)

where the constant t0 is model-dependent. I note that in both the static and dynamical treatment the deviations of
the correlator from the plateay value are O(|τ|1/2) in the β regime. Instead we expect on physical grounds that at
any ﬁnite time the variations of the correlator are linear with τ , i.e. they vanish at leading order. This is the physical
origin of the condition q(aa) = 0, as I said already it corresponds to the well-known feature that the static structure
factor in MCT is linear in τ at the transition. In the static treatment time diﬀerences are either zero (a = b) or
inﬁnity (a (cid:54)= b) and q(aa) = 0 is the only consequence. Instead in the dynamical treatment time-scales are not clearly
separated. This leads to the additional implication that the correlator C(t) cannot be O(|τ|1/2) for t → 0, and this
implies that the prescription does not depend on τ leading to the scaling (41).

B. The Bare Propagator

In this subsection I will study the equation for the bare propagator of the theory. Here the time-scale invariance of
the mean-ﬁeld equation leads to the a spurious zero mode in the propagator that is removed by the prescription (37).
From now on all results are presented for the ﬁrst time.

(cid:90)

By expanding the action around the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation I obtain an equation for the bare propagator:

d(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))G(ab)(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))M1(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))(cd) + m2

dc(cid:48) [G(ab)(c(cid:48)d) + G(ab)(cc(cid:48))] + 2m3

(dc(cid:48)dd(cid:48))G(ab)(c(cid:48)d(cid:48)) = δ(ab)(cd) (42)

where M1(ab)(cd) come from the quadratic part of the action i.e. it satisﬁes for a generic matrix v(ab)

d(cd)M1(ab)(cd)v(cd) ≡ −2w2q(ab)v(ab) − w1

dc(q(ac)v(cb) + v(ac)q(cb))

(43)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

The operators M1 and G are deﬁned on the space of symmetric matrices with zero diagonal, therefore eq. (42) and
the above deﬁnition of M1 hold only for a (cid:54)= b. Equation (42) must be supplemented with the condition

matrices Q(ab) with Q(aa) = 0 such that(cid:82) d(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))A(ab)(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))δ(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))(cd) = A(ab)(cd) where the integration over the

that follows from the constraint Q(aa) = 0. In the r.h.s. δ(ab)(cd) is a delta function in the space of symmetric

couples of diﬀerent indexes can be written in terms of integrations over single indexes as

(51)

I recall that in the replica treatment the above result only holds for n = 1, its general expression being n(n − 1)/2.
More technical details on the use of restricted (d(ab)) and unrestricted (da db) integrations are given later.

The exact expression for the bare propagator will be given at the end of this subsection. Let us start by consider

the following quantity:

χ(ab) ≡

d(cd)G(ab)(cd)

(47)

It is easy to see that χ(ab) is the longitudinal susceptibility, i.e. the derivative of the solution of the mean-ﬁeld
equation with respect to τ :

χ(ab) =

dq(ab)

dτ

,

thus its expression can be obtained by derivation with respect to τ of the solution.
χ(ab) = χ and from (35) the derivative yields:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)1/2

χ =

√
1
2

w1 − w2

(48)

In the replica case we have

(49)

In the dynamical case deriving expression (38) we obtain that χ(ab) is an invariant matrix parameterized by a function
χ(t) given by:

χ(t) =

dC(t)

dτ

= ±

where the scaling function f±(x) is given by:

2(cid:112)|τ|w1

1

f±(t/τβ)

f±(t) ≡ g±(t) +

t
a

dg±
dt

(t) .

the above scaling function has already been discussed in Ref. [27], (the additional factor 1/2 in eq. (15) of [27] is a
√
typo). Since the leading correction to the small time behavior 1/ta of g±(t) is O(ta) [2] one obtains that f±(t) = O(ta)
at small times. For large times we have f−(t) ∝ tb and f+(t) = 1/

1 − λ (as in the static case).

It is instructive to check how that the above expressions satisfy the equation for χ(ab) that can be obtained

integrating over d(ab) equation (42). We have:

(cid:90)

d(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))χ(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))M1(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))(cd) + m2

dc(cid:48) [χ(c(cid:48)d) + χ(cc(cid:48))] + 2m3

Note that in both the replicas and the dynamical treatment we have

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

db χ(ab) = 0

10

(cid:90)

(dc(cid:48) dd(cid:48))χ(c(cid:48)d(cid:48)) = 1 .

(52)

(53)

this is because in both cases χ(ab), being the derivative of an invariant matrix with zero diagonal, is itself an invariant
matrix with zero diagonal and thus satisﬁes expression (32). As a consequence the two terms depending on m2 and
m3 vanish. In the replica case then it is immediate to check that the equation is veriﬁed while the dynamical case is
less trivial. We can rewrite χ(ab) in the dynamical case as:

χ(ab) =

1
2 τ

q(ab) +

1

2 τ a

q0(ab)

(54)

where q0(ab) is deﬁned as the invariant matrix parameterized by t dC(t)/dt. The ﬁrst term is already a solution of
eq. (52) because q(ab) is a solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation (33), thus:

d(cd)M1(ab)(cd)q(cd) = −2w1(q2)ab − 2w2q2

ab = 2τ ,

(55)

(cid:90)

thus q0(ab) must be, and indeed is, a zero mode of the operator M1. The origin of this zero mode lies in the time-scale
invariance of the mean-ﬁeld equation discussed previously. This can be seen starting from the fact tha C(s t) is a
solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation for any s and deriving the mean-ﬁeld equation with respect to s at s = 1. Therefore

the equation (cid:82) d(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))χ(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))M1(a(cid:48)b(cid:48))(cd) = 1 leaves the constant in front of the zero mode unspeciﬁed. In order to

ﬁx it we must resort to the prescription of the previous chapter. The very same terms the control the small-time
behavior of the mean-ﬁeld equation will also be present in the equation for the bare propagator and their eﬀect will
be to impose that χ(t) goes to zero at small times leading immediately to ﬁx the constant of the the zero mode to
1/(2τ a). Consistently one may notice that when we obtained χ(ab) by derivation with respect to τ the second term
in (51) came from the derivative of the time-scale τβ which could be ﬁxed removing time-scale invariance using the
small-time prescription.

of the bare propagator diverge as O(1/(cid:112)|τ|) except those corresponding to the massive modes that remain ﬁnite and
can be considered to be zero on the scale O(1/(cid:112)|τ|) of the propagator.

One should identify the modes to which these ﬁnite masses m2 and m3 correspond and argue that their ﬂuctuations
remains ﬁnite at τ = 0, i.e. they are not critical. From a critical point of view one would argue that all components

In order to proceed with the computation of the bare propagator let us observe that the mass matrix in the critical

As we will see in both the statics and dynamics, what happens is quite diﬀerent from these expectations and leads
to the mapping to the stochastic equations. A key observation is that the structure of the ﬁnite terms is the same in
the replicated and dynamical formalism and we can build on results from the SG literature [19]. In particular we can
rewrite the mass matrix M (ab)(cd) as:

M (ab)(cd) = M1(ab)(cd) − m2PA + 4(m2 + m3)NL

where the operators PA and NL are deﬁned as:
(PAφ)(ab) ≡ −

(cid:90)

with (cid:82) daψ(a) = 0. The operator NL is a constant NL(ab)(cd) = 1, it transform any matrix into a constant but it

One can check that PA is a projector P 2
A = PA on the so-called anomalous subspace (in the replica case this is true if
n → 1). This is the space of matrices Q(ab) with Q(aa) = 0 that can be written (for a (cid:54)= b) as Q(ab) = ψ(a) + ψ(b)
is not a projector, instead it is nilpotent N 2

L = 0 . In both dynamics and static this property follows from eq. (46)

11
and it is essential in the following developments, we will see that the NL term will increase ﬂuctuations instead of
reducing them.

To proceed let us make some qualitative considerations. Given that the anomalous sector has a ﬁnite mass we would
expect that the leading divergent behavior of the propagator would not be changed if we just put the corresponding
component to zero. More precisely we could write:

that is equivalent to:

(cid:90)

dc G(ab)(cd) + O(1) =

(dc dd)G(ab)(cd) ≡ 2χ(ab) .

(cid:90)

If we substitute the above expressions into eq. (42) we have:

G(ab)(cd) = −4(m2 + m3)χ(ab)

from which we ﬁnally arrive at:

this implies that G(ab)(cd) has a double pole i.e. while the small mass M1 is O(
susceptibility χ(ab) is O(M−1

that are less divergent, note that upon integration the double-pole contribution in G(ab)(cd) vanishes because of

We will now present the exact expression of the bare propagator. We deﬁne:

power E = 1, 2, 3, 4. Diagrams (i) and (o) are disconnected and contribute to the correlations but not to connected correlations.
Diagrams (f ) and (p) are fully disconnected and does not contribute at all.

where nL is deﬁned as the matrix with all elements equal to one nL(ab) = 1, nL(aa) = 0. Equation (68) holds because
we have NLχ = PAχ = 0, (NL∆M−1)(ab)(cd) = nL(ab)χ(cd) which cancels with the term (∆M χ)(ab)χ(cd) =
nL(ab)χ(cd).

Note that we have derived above the explicit expression for χ(ab) but we cannot write down in explicit form neither
1/∆M nor 1/M1. However in order to proceed we do not need these quantities explicitly. The only information we

will use is that 1/∆M is O(1/(cid:112)|τ|) for |τ| small, i.e. it is less divergent than the leading order O(1/|τ|) term. This
follows because: i) 1/M1 scales exactly as O(1/(cid:112)|τ|) because the mean-ﬁeld solution q(ab) is proportional to(cid:112)|τ|,

ii) PA is a projector and thus it can reduce ﬂuctuations in the anomalous sector without changing the scaling of the
components that remain critical.
Summarizing the key point is that PA is a projector the operator NL is not. As a consequence while the presence
of PA does not change the scaling of 1/∆M with respect to 1/M1, the presence of NL lead to a completely diﬀerent
scaling behavior of G with respect to 1/∆M with appearance of a double pole.

C. The Diagrammatic Loop Expansion

Let us rewrite the GCT in terms of the deviation of the order parameter Q(ab) from the mean-ﬁeld solution q(ab)

(da db dc)δQ(ab)δQ(bc)δQ(ca) − 1
6

w2

(da db)δQ3(ab) .

(72)

where δQ(ab) ≡ Q(ab) − q(ab) and G(ab)(cd) is the bare propagator studied above. We consider now the loop
expansion obtained by using the Taylor series for the terms proportional to w1 and w2. The various terms in the
expansion are given by all Feynman diagrams with vertices of degree three. The diagrams contributing to a correlation
function of the form (30) involving the order parameter to the power E are given by the (inﬁnite) set of diagrams with
E external lines. The generic average of the form (30) picks up contributions from both connected and disconnected
diagrams. Diagrams where there is a disconnected component that does not contain any external line are called fully
disconnected diagrams and do not contribute, being cancelled by the normalization factor (see e.g. [23]). Connected
correlations obtained from the generic correlation (30) corresponds to connected diagrams. In ﬁg. (1) we display some
of the Feynman diagrams that need to be considered for various objects. To any line in a given diagram we must
attach the bare propagator (95) and to any vertex we must attach the contributions given by w1 and w2 in (72). For
instance if we consider the diagram (g) of ﬁg. (1) that contributes to the dressed propagator (cid:104)Q(ab)Q(cd)(cid:105)c we will

(73)

(74)

(75)

Note that the action (31) is written in terms of unrestricted integrals over the coordinates a, b, c, i.e. in principle it
depends also on Q(aa), therefore the condition Q(aa) = 0 must be explicitly enforced whenever we use unrestricted
integrations as we did below eq. (33) and in (44). When evaluating the Feynman diagrams we can use the unrestricted
expressions for the vertexes (as we did above in (73)) because the constraint δQ(aa) = 0 is automatically enforced by
the propagator through the condition G(ab)(cc) = 0.
Given that the propagators attached to the lines diverge as 1/|τ| we expect that each diagram will also be divergent.
In particular the naive expectation would be that each of the four terms above should be divergent as |τ|−4. This
result instead is wrong, because it turns out that the leading O(τ|−4) term has a zero prefactor. In order to see this
let us replace G(ab)(cd) in the above expressions with its most diverging term vχ(ab)χ(cd). We can check that the
summation at each vertex can now be done independently. For a vertex of type w1 we have a contribution given by:

(cid:90)

(dm dn dl)χ(mn)χ(ml)χ(ln) ,

while for a vertex of type w2 we have a contribution(cid:90)

(dm dn)χ3(mn) ,

the key point is that both contributions vanish. This can be seen starting from the property (proved in the appendix)
that given two invariant matrices A(ab) and B(ab) both A(ab)B(ab) and the matrix product (AB)(ab) are also
invariant matrices. Since χ(ab) is a zero-diagonal invariant matrix, χ3(ab) is also a zero-diagonal invariant matrix,
therefore the property (32) implies that the prefactor (75) vanishes. The prefactor (74) can be rewritten in terms of
the matrix χ(mn)(χ2)(mn) which is zero on the diagonal and property (32) can again be used. We have thus shown
that

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(dm dn dl)χ(mn)χ(ml)χ(ln) =

(dm dn)χ(mn)(χ2)(mn) = 0

(76)

In order to see which contributions are non-zero let us now introduce a graphical representation of the propagator
G(ab)(cd) by associating the most divergent term vχ(ab)χ(cd) = O(|τ|−1) to a crossed line and the less divergent
term ∆M−1 = O(|τ|−1/2) to a full line. This representation is borrowed from the literature on the Random-Field
Ising Model (RFIM), see e.g.
[24]. With this convention the diagram, say, (g) of ﬁg. (1) can be rewritten as the
sum of 16 diagrams, see ﬁg. (2), (only nine diagrams are shown because the remaining seven can be obtained by
symmetries). The most diverging contribution is obtained by putting crossed lines on all lines, this corresponds to
diagram (a) in ﬁg. (2). However we have already seen that if we put a crossed line on each of the three legs of a given
vertex we will have a vanishing contribution, either (74) or (75). The above property leads to the following necessary
condition to have a non-zero contribution: each vertex must have at least a full line attached to it. This implies that
both diagrams (a) and (b) in ﬁg. (2) vanish. In order to obtain the maximum degree of divergence of a given cubic
diagram we have to maximize the number of crossed-lines with the constraint that each vertex is connected to a full
line. The necessary condition can be fulﬁlled by connecting the vertices through tree-like (no-loop) structures of full
lines. Indeed suppose that there is a loop of full lines on the Feynman diagram (as in diagrams (g), (d) and (i) in ﬁg.
(2)), we can open the loop by replacing one full line with a crossed line obtaining a more divergent diagram that still
veriﬁes the necessary condition that each vertex has a full line attached to it (respectively (f ), (e) and (h)).

Actually the condition that each vertex must have at least a full line attached to it in order to give a non-zero
contribution is necessary but not suﬃcient. The necessary and suﬃcient condition, that will be discussed in the
appendix, is that if we split the graph into subgraphs by cutting all crossed lines, every subgraph must contain at
least one external line. Therefore the condition of maximal divergence is that each vertex in the diagram must be on a
tree of full lines and each tree must be connected to an external line. With respect to ﬁgure (2) we have the following:

14

FIG. 2: Diagrams contributing to the two point correlation in the crossed lines representation. Seven other diagrams can be
obtained from symmetries. The necessary condition implies that diagrams (a) and (b) vanish, the necessary and suﬃcient
condition implies that diagrams (g) and (e) also vanish. All remaining diagrams give diverging contributions with non-zero
prefactors. The maximal degree of divergence is given by the terms where the full lines are organized on trees, i.e. diagrams
(f ) and (c).

the necessary condition implies that diagrams (a) and (b) vanish, the necessary and suﬃcient condition implies that
diagrams (g) and (e) also vanish. All remaining diagrams give diverging contributions with non-zero prefactors. The
maximal degree of divergence is given by the terms where the full lines are organized on trees, i.e. diagrams (f ) and
(c). It should be clear that the previous discussion applies to any cubic diagram with any number of external legs
and any number of vertices, i.e. at all orders in the loop expansion.

D. Mapping to the Stochastic equation

In the previous subsection we have shown that the leading divergent diagrams are those associated to trees and now
we will proceed to show that these diagrams are precisely those that are generated by the solutions of a stochastic
equation.
Let us rewrite the quadratic part of the action (31) in terms of the operators PA and NL introduced in the subsection

(III B) as:

The last term can be rewritten in terms of random shift of τ using the identity:

and the generic correlation (30) can now be rewritten as

(80)

With the above transformation the analogy with a stochastic equation is much more plausible but one should also
recognize that the two objects are essentially diﬀerent, and indeed, as we will see, only their leading divergent behavior
is the same. An essential property is that independently of s we have Zs = 1 (and also Z = 1) exactly and therefore
it can be dropped from the above expression giving:

(cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) = (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)s

(81)

This implies that while the mapping to a stochastic equation is approximate there is instead an exact mapping to a
problem with Gaussian quenched disorder. The condition Zs = 1 is essential in this mapping because otherwise the
disorder s would not be an independent Gaussian variable, i.e. it would not be quenched. The proof of the identity
Zs = 1 is postponed to the appendix, here we note that in the replicated case it only holds for n = 1 because it
follows from ln Z = O(n− 1) at all orders in the loop expansion, as such it is almost trivial. In the dynamical context
it is closely related to the system being at equilibrium and does not hold for oﬀ-equilibrium dynamics. A detailed
discussion of the mapping to the quenched problem will be given in the next section. While here we will use it to
complete the discussion of the perturbative loop expansion of the previous subsection.
Let us consider the expression of the correlations (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)s before averaging over the disorder. We can also
compute them in a loop expansion. Although s and τ play the same role in Ls in order to make contact with the
loop expansion of the GCT it is appropriate to study the expansion of the correlations in powers of the source s and
of the coupling constants w1 and w2. The mean-ﬁeld solution of the action L0 with zero source is therefore the same
of L because they diﬀer by a term − v
that, as we saw before, is irrelevant for the solution of the
equation. The diﬀerence becomes apparent at the level of the bare propagator which is now given by the sole term
1/∆M . Therefore the correlation function of a product of E Q’s before averaging is given by the sum of all cubic
diagrams with E external lines, bare propagators 1/∆M , the same vertices w1 and w2 and sources s. The sources will
be represented by arrows and we must attach to the body of the arrows a bare propagator 1/∆M and to the head

(cid:0)(cid:82) d(ab)Q(ab)(cid:1)2

the ﬁeld s. In ﬁgure (3) we display some of the diagrams contributing to the two-point correlation (cid:104)Q(ab)Q(cd)(cid:105)s.
The diagram (a(cid:48)) corresponds to the bare propagator 1/∆M . Note that the integration of the indexes at the head of
the arrow can be done explicitly and we obtain for the total contribution of an arrow

d(cd)

1

∆M

(ab)(cd) s = s χ(ab)

(82)

Now we see how from the above diagrammatic expression of (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)s in terms of full lines and arrows we
get after averaging over s the diagrammatic expression of (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) obtained in the previous section in terms
of full and crossed lines. Indeed the Gaussian average over s selects the diagrams with even powers of s, each couples
of sources gives a contribution s2 = v, this can represented graphically by saying that two arrows each one with an
associated term sχ are joined together to form a crossed line associated to a term vχχ. For instance after average
1) diagrams (a(cid:48)) and (b(cid:48)) give precisely the bare propagator of the GCT, eq. (95), ”) diagrams (e(cid:48)) and (f(cid:48)) vanish
(2):
because the average of s is zero, 3) the other diagrams corresponds to diagrams of the GCT shown in ﬁg.
(c(cid:48)) → (d), (d(cid:48)) → (h), (g(cid:48)) → (i), (h(cid:48)) → (c), (i(cid:48)) → (b). Up to this point no approximation has been made, we have
just explained how the exact equation (81) can be veriﬁed at all order comparing the diagrammatic expansions of its
left-hand and right-hand sides.

In the previous section however we have argued that in the critical region where the bare propagator G(ab)(cd)
is large the most diverging contributions of a given cubic diagram (those of ﬁg. (1)) written in the crossed-lines
representation (as in ﬁg. (2)) are those where each vertex belong to tree-like networks of full lines 1/∆M . Since the
process of averaging over s does not alter the structure of the full lines 1/∆M this implies that the most divergent
diagrams had a tree-like structure also before the s averaging, meaning that we can replace (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)s with
its expression computed only with tree-like diagrams.

(cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)tree

s

(83)

A classic ﬁeld-theoretical result is that the sum of all tree-like diagrams is given exactly by the following expression

(cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105)tree

s = qs(ab) . . . qs(cd)

where qs(ab) is the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation in presence of the source s
s )(ab) − w2 q2

0 = −(τ + s) − m2(PAqs)(ab) − w1(q2

s (ab)

(84)

(85)

In the dynamical case we must remember that the above equation is time-scale invariant and leaves qs(ab) undeter-
mined up to a rescaling of time. As discussed before this invariance is removed by the prescription (37) that follows
from the presence of hidden terms in the action controlling the small-time behavior of the order parameter. Since Ls
is obtained by L one can easily see that these terms are also present and therefore the very same prescription must
be used to determine qs(ab).

Let us write down the result explicitly in the static and dynamical case. In the static case for a correlation of order

E we have

where qs is the solution of

(cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) ≈ qE

s

0 = −(τ + s) + (w1 − w2) q2

s → qs =

(cid:114) τ + s

(w1 − w2)

(86)

(87)

Thus we have rederived diagrammatically the result of section of [18]. Note that a real solution qs to the equation
exists only for τ + s ≥ 0 therefore the expression qE
s is ill-deﬁned because it involves an integration over s on the
whole real axes. This suggests that (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) is actually ill-deﬁned in the replica case. In the dynamical case
if we specialize to the correlation part of the order parameter we have:

(cid:104)C(ta, tb) . . . C(tc, td)(cid:105) ≈ Cs(ta − tb) . . . Cs(tc − td)

where Cs(t) is solution of the time-scale invariant dynamical equation

τ + s = −w2 C 2

with the prescription (37). At variance with the replica case the function Cs(t) exists for all values of s and therefore
the average (88) is perfectly well deﬁned. The solution can be written in terms of the two functions g±(t) introduced
before

Cs(t) =(cid:112)|τ + s|/w1gsign(τ +s)(t/(|τ + s|/w1)1/2a)

(90)

The above equations deﬁne SBR in the zero-dimensional case and we have thus proven that at each order in the loop
expansion the leading divergent terms of the GCT are the same of SBR, as anticipated in [1].
Note that in the replica case a correlation (cid:104)Q(ab) . . . Q(cd)(cid:105) of order E takes diﬀerent values depending on the
number of indexes that are diﬀerent but at the leading order this diﬀerences do not show up because all values are
given by qE
s according to (86). These features are corrected by subleading terms that cannot be associated to the
stochastic equation [44]. A similar feature is present in the dynamical case: the l.h.s. of (88) depends on all time
diﬀerences while the r.h.s. depends only on ta − tb, . . . , tc − td, again this property does not hold exactly due to
subleading terms that cannot be mapped to a stochastic equation.

E. Finite Dimension

We now add a space-dependence to the order parameter Qx(ab) with the same properties described in the previous
sections. The standard way to modify the action is to add a term proportional to the squared gradient of the order
parameter, arguing that all other terms depending on spatial derivatives are less important in the critical region.
Thus we are now interested in computing the averages

(92)
and L[Qx] means the action (31) evaluated for Q(ab) → Qx(ab). In order to setup the perturbative computation of
the above averages we perform the same step of the previous section. The mean-ﬁeld equation is the same of (33) plus
an additional Laplacian term ∇2Qx(ab). We will consider a translational invariant solution Qx(ab) = q(ab), and since
the Laplacian is irrelevant in this case the solution q(ab) is the same of the zero-dimensional case discussed in section
(III A). We recall once again that the mean-ﬁeld equation is time-scale invariant and the action must be supplemented
with the prescritpion (37) to have a unique mean-ﬁeld solution. In the space-dependent context we have to generalize
the prescription by assuming that the same local terms are present at each point in space in order to have the same
prescription everywhere and thus a constant mean-ﬁeld solution.

The bare propagator instead is changed with respect to the zero-dimensional case. It is conveniently diagonalized

by going to Fourier space:

and Gk satisﬁes the equation

Gk,k(cid:48)(ab)(cd) = Gk(ab)(cd)δ(k + k(cid:48))

(93)

(94)
that generalizes eq. (68), in particular the quantities ∆M , NL and v have the same deﬁnitions of eq. (68). Similarly
the exact expression of the bare propagator is

(k2 + ∆M + vNL)Gk = I

Gk(ab)(cd) =

1

k2 + ∆M

(ab)(cd) + v χk(ab)χk(cd)

where χq(ab) is the solution of the equation

χk(k2 + ∆M ) = 1

(95)

(96)

The physical meaning of the function χk can be understood considering the response of the system to a space-dependent
perturbation on τ . This can be seen with the following replacement in the action:

(cid:90)

− τ

(cid:20)(cid:90)

d(ab)Qk(ab)

(97)

A uniform value of τx corresponds in Fourier space to τk = τ0 δ(k), meaning that all components of the mean-ﬁeld
solution but k = 0 vanish. A non-constant τx induces a non-constant mean-ﬁeld solution meaning that the components
qk(ab) is diﬀerent from zero also for k (cid:54)= 0. One can see that the susceptibility of qk(ab) to τk(cid:48) at the constant solution
τx = τ is determined by χk, more precisely we have:

= δ(k + k(cid:48))χk(ab)

(98)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)τx=τ

dqk
dτk(cid:48)

(ab)

The above relationship generalizes eq. (48) and can be veriﬁed by deriving the mean-ﬁeld equation with respect to
τk(cid:48) obtaining thus eq. (99) for the susceptibility. Since both in the static and dynamical case the solution qk(ab) in
presence of a inhomogeneous τx is an invariant, the matrix χk(ab) is also an invariant. In the dynamical treatment
the corresponding function χk(t) obeys the following equation

k2χk(t) − 2w2C(t)χk(t) + 2w1

d
dt

C(t − t(cid:48))χk(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) = 1 .

(99)

(cid:90) t

0

At variance with the k = 0 case the function χk(t) does not have a simple expression in terms of the mean-ﬁeld
solution C(t). Note that χk(t) should be naturally identiﬁed with the scaling function for the so-called three-point
susceptibility in the β regime in the context of IMCT, although eq. (99) does not appear explicitly in [16]. A detailed
discussion of χk(t) is not essential here, indeed to continue with the derivation we only need the property that χk(ab)
is an invariant.

We can now repeat the analysis of the leading divergences of the diagrams, except that now each vertex carry a

contribution of a vertex that has three crossed lines at his legs is zero, indeed we have the two contributions

and again both contributions vanish because χk(ab) is an invariant with zero diagonal. Therefore the same necessary
condition leads to the choice of tree-like structures in order to maximize the degree of divergence of a graph. The
analysis of zero-dimensional case can now be extended in a straightforward fashion. One rewrites the quadratic term
in the GCT introducing a quenched space-dependent Gaussian ﬂuctuation s(x) as in (78)

In this way the averages (91) can be rewritten as in (79)

s(x)s(y) = δ(x − y) v .

(cid:104)Qx(ab) . . . Qy(cd)(cid:105) =

(cid:104)Qx(ab) . . . Qy(cd)(cid:105)sZs

Zs

(102)

(103)

Once again one can show that the partition function is equal to one independently of the realization of the random
ﬂuctuations: Zs = 1. This leads to the fundamental result that the GCT is exactly equivalent to a theory with
quenched disorder:

(cid:104)Qx(ab) . . . Qy(cd)(cid:105) = (cid:104)Qx(ab) . . . Qy(cd)(cid:105)s

(104)
The perturbative loop expansion of the GCT is divergent at all orders as τ → ±0 and using the crossed lines
representation one can again argue that the maximally divergent contribution of any given diagram is given by the
necessary and suﬃcient condition discussed above. On the other hand this corresponds to select diagrams that are
tree-like before averaging and these in turn are generated by the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation in presence of
the sources s(x). We have therefore the following

where qx,s(ab) is the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation in presence of the source s(x)

(cid:104)Qx(ab) . . . Qy(cd)(cid:105) ≈ qx,s(ab) . . . qy,s(cd)

0 = −τ − s(x) − ∇2qs,x − w1(q2

s,x)(ab) − w2 q2

s,x(ab) .

(105)

(106)

19

Note that we have not written the term depending on m2 in (85) since it gives a vanishing contribution because the
solution qs,x is an invariant. In the dynamical case we must remember that the above equation is time-scale invariant
and leaves qx,s(ab) undetermined up to a rescaling of time. As discussed before this invariance is removed by the
prescription (37) that follows from the presence of hidden terms in the action controlling the small-time behavior of
the order parameter. Since Ls is obtained by L one can easily see that these terms are also present and therefore the
very same prescription must be used to determine qx,s(ab).

In the static/replicated case the above stochastic equation is rewritten in terms of its RS solution qs,x(ab) = qs,x

where qs,x is the solution of a quadratic stochastic equation:

0 = −τ − s(x) − ∇2qs,x + (w1 − w2)(q2

s,x) .

(107)

This equation does not admit a real solution in ﬁnite dimension in the thermodynamic limit, because even for large
positive values of τ there will be always regions where the local temperature τ + s(x) is negative. We have thus
recovered diagrammatically the resul of [18].

We now turn to the dynamical case, if we specialize, as in zero dimension, to the correlation part of the order

parameter the equation (106) translates into:

(cid:104)Cx(ta, tb) . . . Cy(tc, td)(cid:105) ≈ gs,x(ta − tb) . . . gs,y(tc − td)

where gs,y(t) is the solution of the SBR equation

gs,x(t − t(cid:48))gs,x(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)

(108)

(109)

with the prescription (37). At variance with the static case the function gs,x(t) exists for all values of s(x) and
therefore the dynamical theory is perfectly well deﬁned. The above equations deﬁne SBR in the ﬁnite-dimensional
case and we have shown that at each order in the loop expansion the leading divergent terms of the GCT are the
same of SBR, thus completing the proof of the results anticipated in [1]. As already noted, only the averaged order
parameter was mentioned in [1] while it should be clear from the above discussion that the connection with SBR holds
for all higher order correlation functions as well.

IV. BEYOND PERTURBATION THEORY

Let us summarize the results of the previous section. We started from the the GCT action (31) that at the mean-
ﬁeld level exhibits a dynamical transition. Loop corrections to the mean-ﬁeld expressions are all divergent as we
approach the transition and we have shown that at the leading order the contribution of each diagram is the same
generated by the loop expansion of SBR. Technically this is similar to what happens for the RFIM or for branched
polymers [25].

In general below the upper critical dimension and above the lower critical dimension a system exhibits a diﬀerent
critical behavior from mean-ﬁeld. However one can use the perturbative expansion around the mean-ﬁeld solution to
extract the non-mean-ﬁeld critical exponents by resumming them appropriately. Note that to apply these resummation
techniques one does not need the whole loop expansion but only the leading divergent terms at each order. Thus if
the leading order divergent terms are the same of a stochastic equation one would argue that the critical behavior is
exactly the same. In other words the mapping between the eﬀective theory and the stochastic equation holds only at
the leading order, i.e. it is approximate but it is exact as long as we discuss critical behavior. Indeed in the case of
branched polymers one can show that the critical exponents of the two theories are the same [25].

In the presente context however the situation is quite diﬀerent. Indeed when we consider the GCT beyond mean-
ﬁeld approximation the critical point is avoided and nothing is divergent. As a consequence there is no guarantee that:
ﬁrst, we can replace the actual model under study with the eﬀective GCT, and second we can replace the GCT with
SBR. These kind of problems occur when we are below the lower critical dimensions and are not often considered in
the theory of critical phenomena which is focused by deﬁnition on what happens between the upper and lower critical
dimension.

The ﬁrst problem is generic to any Landau theory and cannot be discussed within the theory itself. It depends
on the system under study whose long-wavelength Hamiltonian must verify two properties: 1) the coeﬃcient τ of
the linear term must vanish for some temperature and 2) higher order terms (quartic and so on) and all other terms
in that are present in full action but not in the GCT can be neglected. A suﬃcient condition for this to happen
is that the system under study exhibits mean-ﬁeld-like critical behavior in some range of temperatures above the
(pseudo)-critical temperature. This is a rather non-trival feature because it means that in that range of temperatures

we can replace the integral of the action (31) with its value on the mean-ﬁeld solution, if this is the we can describe
the critical region, where corrections are important, with the GCT. In practice if a given super-cooled liquid exhibits
approximately the scaling laws of ideal MCT in some range or temperatures then one can expect that GCT provides
an accurate whilst approximate description in the crossover region.

20

The second problem, i.e. the mapping between the GCT and SBR, is less standard. The zero-dimensional case
is the paradigm of the system below the lower critical dimension and therefore it is a good starting point. In the
previous section we have shown that there is an exact mapping between the GCT and a GCT with quenched disorder

where the overline means average over a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance v. The above
formula is the result of an Hubbard-Stratonovich integration combined with the result Zs = Z = 1. We recall that
the importance of this last condition should not be underestimated because otherwise s could not be considered an
independent (quenched) Gaussian variable. The result Zs = 1 is proven in the appendix at all orders in perturbation
theory but it seems to have a deeper physical origin: the fact that system is at equilibrium and therefore TTI holds.
Now we can precisely assess what kind of approximation we are doing when we replace the original GCT with SBR:
it corresponds to study the action Ls at the mean-ﬁeld level i.e. replacing Q(ab) with the solution of the equation
dLs/dQ = 0. The quality of this approximation depends on the coupling constants of the GCT. In order to proceed
let us rescale s to make its variance equal to one. In this case we have

When Ls is rewritten in the above form one can easily argue that perturbative corrections to the mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation are given by an expansion in powers of O(1/C) and therefore the condition for its validity is that the constant
C must be large. Even if C is large, the random ﬂuctuations can be neglected if |˜τ| (cid:29) 1, this is the regime where
not only Ls but also the original GCT (L) are both well described by the mean-ﬁeld approximation. Summarizing if
the constant C is large the GCT can be described by the mean-ﬁeld approximation for large ˜τ , while for ˜τ = O(1)
it cannot be accurately described by the mean-ﬁeld approximation (that would predict an ideal transition at ˜τ = 0)
and one must see the crossover behavior. However the random action Ls can still be approximated at the mean-ﬁeld
level, meaning that the crossover is well described by SBR.
Clearly the condition that C is large is violated if the random temperature ﬂuctuations are too small i.e. v (cid:28) 1, in
this case the mapping to the stochastic equation is not granted and the crossover is described by the pure cubic theory.
Diﬀerent scalings should be considered, the critical region is still given by ˜τ = O(1) but we should set bτ = w1/3
−1/3
and bQ = w
. We note that the condition that C is large is the counterpart for an avoided critical point of to
1
the Harris criterion that, for a genuine critical point, determines weather the disordered and the pure system are in
diﬀerent universality classes [26]. Similarly the condition ˜τ = O(1) should be identiﬁed with the so-called Ginzburg
criterion that identiﬁes the region where the mean-ﬁeld approximation to the Landau theory is wrong and takes a
diﬀerent form depending on weather the Harris criterion is veriﬁed or not.

21

There is at least one case in which the two questions discussed so far can be both answered positively i.e. when
considering ﬁnite-size corrections to mean-ﬁeld models. In this case all coupling constants in the Hamiltonian are
proportional to the system-size, say N , and it follows that higher order terms not present in the GCT are irrelevant
in the crossover region. Furthermore the fact that v and w1 are O(N ) implies:

C = O(N 1/4)

(116)

meaning that the constant C grows with the system-size and therefore can be taken as large as we want by considering
large systems. In particular this implies that SBR describes the ﬁnite-size corrections to the dynamics of mean-ﬁeld
1RSB-SG models. Note that in this case τ is proportional to T − Tc times a O(N ) constant and the crossover region
described by SBR is

|T − Tc| = O(N−1/2)

(117)

while ideal MCT scalings hold outside this region. This scaling is diﬀerent from what happens in a pure cubic theory
where T − Tc = N−2/3 instead and it is again a manifestation that the form of the Ginzburg criterion depends on
weather the Harris criterion is veriﬁed or not.

In the present framework one can also discuss the time scale of the β regime. A Landau theory holds as long as
the order parameter is somehow small. Clearly this condition is violated for small enough times (when the correlator
is approaching the plateau) and for large enough times (when the correlator leaves the plateau). This allows to
rationalize the divergence of the correlator at small and large times as 1/ta and −tb. In both cases the divergences
must be interpreted as the correlator respectively entering and exiting the β regime where the GCT applies. Given
that the order parameter is O(bQ) the time scale of the β regime can be obtained from bQ(t0/τb)−a = 1 where t0 is
the scale of the initial dynamics and it is ﬁnite. This leads to

Note the analogy with (41) that can be obatined from the scaling bQ =

In the following we generalize the above treatment to generic dimension D. We consider the most general case in

which the constant in front of the space derivative term takes a generic value α:

(127)

The zero dimension discussion can now be repeated. If the constant C is large enough the action before disorder
average can be treated at the mean-ﬁeld level and the mapping to SBR is accurate in the crossover region. For
|˜τ| (cid:29) 1 we are outside the crossover region and also the action after averaging, i.e. the GCT, can be treated at
mean-ﬁeld level. In this region the ideal MCT scalings apply, including an apparent O(|˜τ|−1/4) divergence of the
correlation length. The crossover region is identiﬁed by the Ginzburg criterion ˜τ = O(1) that is deﬁned through eq.
(122) provided C is large enough [45].
The C (cid:29) 1 condition is the analog of the Harris criterion and depends on the speciﬁc model considered, however
similarly to the zero-dimensional case one can deﬁne models where both the two conditions discussed previously hold
provided a tunable parameter M is large. Essentially one needs to increase the number of local microscopic interactions
at the price of loosing quantitative contact with realistic models. For spin systems a classic way to achieve this is to
put M spins on each given lattice point, see [28]. For supercooled liquids one should consider long-range interactions
so that each particle interacts with a large number O(M ) of nearby other particles, unfortunately at present no such
model has been developed, see the discussion in [29]. On the other hand the present theory describes the model of
Mari and Kurchan (MK) [29], with M = λD where λ is the lengthscale of the random spatial shift and provides the
description of the crossover at large but ﬁnite λ. In [30] the λ → ∞ version of the model was investigated at ﬁnite
volume and thus corresponds to the zero-dimensional case at ﬁnite N . For large but ﬁnite M the constants v, w1, w2
and α should be O(M ) leading to:

C = O(M

(128)

that reduces to (116) for D = 0. Similarly to (117) the size of the crossover region also shrinks with increasing M as

|T − Tc| = O(1/M

The α and β time scale behavior for increasing M at ﬁxed ˜τ can be derived as before and read:

(129)

(130)

The corresponding scalings at ﬁxed M and changing ˜τ can be derived in the context of SBR [7]. We only quote the
result for τα respectively for ˜τ → −∞ and for ˜τ → ∞

τα = O(|˜τ|−γ) ,

ln τα = O(˜τ 2−D/2)

(131)

Before we noticed that in practice if a system exhibit MCT-like scalings in some range of temperatures then it is
natural to expect that the crossover region is described by the GCT. Now we want to discuss a practical criterion in
order to determine weather the GCT should be described by SBR in the crossover region. Approaching the crossover
region from above one expects that ﬂuctuations (the full propagator) are well described by the bare propagator. The
main feature of the bare propagator is the presence of the so-called double pole term proportional to χ(ab)χ(cd)
which leads to larger dynamical ﬂuctuations with respect to those associated to temperature variations (χ(ab)). On
the other hand the double-pole term would have a subdominant prefactor if the constant C is small and therefore the
fact that one observes ﬂuctuations proportional to χ2 (as reported in some notable case for supercooled liquids [16])
can be taken as an indication that the constant C is large and that the crossover region may be accurately described
by SBR.

We conclude this section noticing the the above scalings with M are singular at D = 8 and make no sense for
D > 8. They were obtained under the implicit assumption that the GCT and SBR admit a canonical continuous limit
in a ﬁeld-theoretical sense and the ill-deﬁned scalings for D > 8 must be taken as an indication that the continuous
limit is not well deﬁned for D > 8.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The starting point of our discussion is the fact that 1RSB-SG and MCT display a dynamical transition with the
same features. In particular the equation for the critical correlator is the same. The transition is second-order in
nature i.e. it is characterized by a diverging correlation length, a classic result in SG and that can be seen through
IMCT. In both cases the transition is mean-ﬁeld in nature, in the sense that the order parameters obeys an equation

23

with coupling constants that are regular functions of the external parameters. This is equivalent to the assumption
that the (Dynamical) Gibbs Free energy (i.e. the integral of the action) has also regular coupling constants. The
theory of phase transitions tells us that this result has to be put under scrutiny and notably fails below the upper
critical dimension. Indeed physics requires that the microscopic Hamiltonian (i.e. the action), not the Gibbs free
energy (i.e.
the integral of the action), has a regular dependence on the external parameter [46]. On the other
hand the theory also tell us that in order to study this problem one has to consider an eﬀective action that is a
simple function (a polynomial) of the order parameter on long wavelength, i.e. a Landau theory. In order to choose
this eﬀective theory we can ﬁrst consider the so-called FM limit, in which all dynamical correlation functions take a
simpliﬁed (RS-like) structure. It follows that in the FM limit the eﬀective action must also display a RS-like form,
indeed in this way one can show that equilibrium dynamics becomes equivalent to a replicated problem with n = 1
replicas. The replicated problem was originally studied in [18] where a mapping to a static stochastic equation was
discovered. The static equation however is ill-deﬁned suggesting that the arrested state is unstable and the transition
is actually avoided as one expects from the physics of supercooled liquids where a crossover is observed instead. In
order to have a well-deﬁned theory of the crossover one must therefore abandon the FM limit and the static replica
treatment that are only deﬁned in the glassy phase. In this case the dynamical correlations do not have the simpliﬁed
RS-like structure and correspondingly the dynamical action must contains additional terms depending explicitly on
the microscopic dynamical scale Γ0. An important technical point however is that the FM/RS mean-ﬁeld equations
admit also non-FM dynamical solutions. At variance with the static case, these solutions exist both above and below
the critical temperature and are precisely the same of the critical correlator in MCT. The absence of Γ0-dependent
terms in the equations induces a spurious time-scale invariance that can be removed invoking matching arguments
with the physics on microscopic times. Formally we supplement the dynamical action with a prescription to remove
time-scale invariance that is justiﬁed by the presence of the hidden Γ0-dependent terms. The identiﬁcation of the
correct eﬀective theory for a given problem can be done in some cases explicitly, but in general it is more satisfactory
to solve the problem invoking some symmetry principle. For 1RSB-SG one can explicitly show that the eﬀective
theory is the GCT given by eq. (31) but for MCT this is not possible at present, because we do not know how to
compute within the theory many quantities, notably four-point correlation functions. On the other hand time-scale
invariance provides us a nice principle to carry on the identiﬁcation, we know that ideal MCT is time-scale invariant
and requiring the eﬀective theory preserves this feature we are naturally led to the GCT.

The main part of the paper was devoted to the study of the GCT. Given that an exact computation of the averages
of the order parameter is not possible we ﬁrst considered a diagrammatic loop expansion. Let us recall that if M is
some large parameter and the coupling constants τ , m2, m3, w1 and w2 are O(M ) (as we discussed in section (IV) the
loop expansion corresponds to an expansion in powers of 1/M . As usual the coeﬃcients of the various powers of 1/M
are divergent as τ → 0 and we have seen that, at any given order 1/M , the leading divergent term is the same that is
generated within a similar loop expansion of SBR. Thus I have provided the proof of the result that was anticipated
in [1] and further discussed in [6]. Note that in that paper only the average two-point function was discussed while
we have shown here that SBR provides a description of higher-order correlations as well, e.g. the four-point function.
In general if the transition is not washed out by the ﬂuctuations one can appropriately re-sum the divergent terms
in the loop expansion and obtain information on the non-mean-ﬁeld critical exponents. Therefore in these cases a
mapping with a stochastic equation would imply an exact connection between the critical exponents. In the present
case however the transition is avoided and we are more in the situation that occurs below the lower critical dimension
so that the mapping between the GCT and SBR is approximate. Furthermore the avoided nature of the transition
within SBR as discussed in [1, 6, 7] is clearly due to non-perturbative eﬀects and one would like to be sure that the
same non-perturbative eﬀects are at work in the GCT, thus establishing a connection between the two theories beyond
perturbation theory. This problem has been discussed in the last section. It turned out that one can establish an exact
mapping between the GCT and a theory with quenched disorder. This allows to understand clearly the approximation
that one is making when going to the GCT to SBR: SBR amounts to make a mean-ﬁeld approximation separately on
each instance once the quenched disorder has been generated. In formulas the exact mapping corresponds to eq. (81)
while the SBR approximation corresponds to eq. (83). Note that the exact mapping with a quenched problem was not
discussed in [1] and it is more signiﬁcant than the mapping with SBR that holds only for the leading divergent term
at each order in the loop expansion. Furthermore the mapping allows a compact quantitative and non-perturbative
discussion of the range of the coupling constants where the mapping to SBR is valid. Besides, even if for some values
of the coupling constants SBR could not applicable quantitatively, it is clear that qualitatively the idea that dynamical
arrest is washed away by random ﬂuctuations of the temperature remains valid. The exact mapping implies that one
can drop the perturbative loop expansion of the second section altogether and study only the quenched theory and
its relation with SBR. I have chosen not to do so because the diagrammatic expansion is very instructive but also
because the mapping with the quenched problem relies on the property Z = Zs = 1 that were proven at all orders
in the appendix. Much as (32) they appear to be a consequence of the system being at equilibrium and thus could
likely be proven non-perturbatively as well.

24

As an additional remark note that while the static replica treatment is insuﬃcient to describe the dynamical
crossover, it is instead applicable to problems where there is a genuine second-order phase transition at the mean-ﬁeld
level, i.e. pinned systems [31]. In the replica case the condition Zs = 1 is almost trivial and allows to establish in a
deﬁnitive way a mapping between pinned systems and systems with quenched random ﬁelds that have been advocated
often in recent literature [31–34].

I conclude noticing that both the GCT and its mapping to SBR are quantitatively correct for Kac models in the
non-trivial limit of the Kac parameter being large but not inﬁnite. This ensure that both objects and the description
of the crossover they provide is consistent from a physical point of view including the less obvious properties.

Appendix A: Invariant Matrices

In the dynamical treatment the order parameter has the structure of a matrix A(b)

A(ab) = CA(ta, tb) + ˜RA(ta, tb)nb + ˜RA(tb, ta)na + XA(ta, tb)nanb .

(A1)

Thus the matrix A(ab) is parameterized by three functions C, ˜R and X and the symmetry A(ab) = A(ba) implies
that C(t, t(cid:48)) = C(t(cid:48), t) and X(t, t(cid:48)) = X(t(cid:48), t), the function ˜R(t, t(cid:48)) instead is not symmetric. When we integrate an
action of the form (31) over the order parameter all components C, ˜R and X to be integrated upon are independent,
however an essential role is played by the notion of invariant in which the matrix is parameterized in term of a single
function CA(s) deﬁned for s ≥ 0:

according to:

A(ab) → CA(s)

CA(t, t(cid:48)) = CA(|t − t(cid:48)|)

˜RA(t, t(cid:48)) = ˜RA(t − t(cid:48)) = θ(t − t(cid:48))

d

dt(cid:48) CA(t − t(cid:48))

XA(t, t(cid:48)) = 0

(A5)

Two important properties that we have used extensively in the paper concern products of invariant matrices. The
ﬁrst one is that given two invariant matrices A and B the product A(ab)B(ab) is also an invariant parameterized by
a function CA(t)CB(t)

The second property is that the matrix product (cid:82) A(ac)B(cb)dc with respect to the integral (cid:82) A(c)dc ≡
(cid:82)

0+ A(tc, ηc)dtcdηc + A(0, 0) is also an invariant (and therefore invariant matrices commute). A straightforward
computation shows that the function CA·B(t) that parameterizes the dot product takes the form:

A(ab)B(ab) → CA(s)CB(s)

(A6)

A(ac)B(cb)dc → CA·B(s) = CA(0)CB(s) + CA(s)CB(0) − d
ds

CA(s − y)CB(y)dy

the critical correlator of MCT. One can easily verify that (cid:82) A(ab)da does not depend on b for an invariant matrix,

The above expression has been used in subsection (III A) to show that the mean-ﬁeld equation gives the equation for

ds + CA(tb) = CA(0)

(A8)

In the case in which the invariant matrix satisﬁes also A(aa) = 0 → CA(0) = 0 we obtain the essential relationship
(32). Note that the property of having CA(0) = 0 is clearly stable under the product. It is also invariant under the
dot product indeed we have:

CA·B(0) = CA(0)CB(0)

(A9)

If the limits CA(∞) and CB(∞) exist we have:

CA·B(∞) = CA(0)CB(∞) + CB(0)CA(∞) − CB(∞)CA(∞)

and one can verify the matching with the corresponding expressions for RS matrices in the limit n → 1

(AB)d = adbb + (n − 1)aof f bof f , (AB)of f = adbof f + bdaof f + (n − 2)aof f bof f

25

(A10)

(A11)

where the subscript d and of f refer to the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal elements of the RS matrices. Thus we see that the
stability of the zero-diagonal condition is speciﬁc of the formalism, it does not hold for n (cid:54)= 1 and for oﬀ-equilibrium
dynamics.

1. Generalized Invariants

Here we consider the notion of generalized invariant. This is a function that depends on many indexes

In the replica case a generalized invariant must be invariant under a permutation of the indexes

A(π(a)π(b)π(c) . . . π(m)) = A(abc . . . m)

A(abc . . . m)

(A12)

(A13)

In the dynamical case we deﬁne an invariant by the following properties: i) It must be time-translational invariant;

ii) the η component associated to the maximum time must vanish, i.e. if, say ta = max(ta, tb, tc . . . td, te) and we

introduce the following notation for the scalar and η components:

A(a, b, c, . . . , d, e) = Asa (ta, b, c, . . . , d, e) + Aηa (ta, b, c, . . . , d, e)ηa

we have:

Aηa (ta, b, c, . . . , d, e) = 0 .

This condition enforces causality: a correlation function is unaﬀected by a perturbation at later times.

iii) if, say, te is the minimum time i.e. te = min(ta, tb, tc . . . td, te) then with the notations above we have:

Aηe (a, b, tc, . . . , d, te) =

d
dte

Ase (a, b, c, . . . , d, te)

(A14)

(A15)

(A16)

Therefore depending on the ordering of the time {ta, tb, tc, . . . , td, te} we have the two relations above for the compo-
nents of the maximum and of the minimum. Note that condition ii) is consistent with causality: a correlation function
is unaﬀected by a perturbation at later times and condition iii) is consistent with FDT. Thus it is natural to expect
that generic equilibrium averages have the structure of generalized invariants.

It can be checked that the product of two invariants is also an invariant in the sense that the three properties above

are veriﬁed. This include that case in which some of the indexes are the same:

Another important property is that the integral of an invariant

(cid:90)

deA(abc . . . de)

A(abc . . . de)B(a(cid:48)bc . . . de)

(A17)

(A18)

(A19)

(A20)

is still an invariant. In order to prove this statement let us assume without loss of generality that when the index e
is integrated out ta is the largest time and td is the smallest time. If we write:

A(a, b, c, . . . , d, e) = Ase (a, b, c, . . . , d, te) + Aηe(a, b, c, . . . , d, te)ηe

we have that

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

deA(abc . . . de) = Ase (a, b, c, . . . , d, 0) +

dteAηe (a, b, c, . . . , d, te) .

Applying the properties ii) and iii) we have:

deA(abc . . . de) = Ase(a, b, c, . . . , d, td) +

26

(cid:90) ta

td

dteAηe (a, b, c, . . . , d, te) .

(A21)

from the above formula we can easily check that the l.h.s remains TTI after the integration. We also see that in the
above expression, ta is always the maximum time therefore the l.h.s. satisﬁes also the causality property ii). In order
to verify the minimum condition we write explicitly the scalar and η components with respect to variable d. Now the
ηd component of (A21) reads:

Aηdse (a, b, c, . . . , td, td) +

dteAηdηe (a, b, c, . . . , td, te) .

(A22)

(cid:90) ta

td

(cid:90)

d
dtd

The derivative of the scalar component of (A21) is made of two terms, the ﬁrst is:

Asesd (a, b, c, . . . , td, td) = Aηdse(a, b, c, . . . , td, td) + Aηesd (a, b, c, . . . , td, td)

(A23)

(cid:90) ta
(cid:90) ta

td

(cid:90) ta

d

where we have used property ii) of A. The second is:

dteAsdηe (a, b, c, . . . , td, te) = −Asdηe (a, b, c, . . . , td, td) +

dte

d
dtd

Asdηe (a, b, c, . . . , td, te) =

= −Asdηe (a, b, c, . . . , td, td) +

dteAηdηe(a, b, c, . . . , td, te) .

(A24)

see that the sum of (A23) and (A24) is equal to (A22), thus proving that the(cid:82) deA(abcd . . . de) veriﬁes the minimum

where the last equality follows from the fact that inside the integral td is the minimum and eq. (A16) applies. We

td

condition (A16).

It is clear that higher order equilibrium correlation functions are associated to generalized invariants much as the
two-time correlations are associated to invariant matrices deﬁned by (16). Since the generic averages (30) are associated
to equilibrium correlation functions they must be generalized invariants, this indeed can be veriﬁed self-consistently
at every order in the expansion around the mean-ﬁeld solution.

Appendix B: The partition function

In this section we want to show that the partition function Zs and Z are both equal to one exactly. In order to
do so we will show that ln Zs is zero on the mean-ﬁeld solution qs(ab) and that corrections to the mean-ﬁeld values
vanish at all orders.
Every term in the actions L and Ls has a RS-like structure. The general RS-like term is formed considering a
product of Q’s where some indexes are equal and integrating over all indexes. According to the previous subsection
it follows that such a procedure leads to a generalized invariant, more speciﬁcally if we consider one Q(ab) in the

product and integrate over all the remaining indexes we will end up with an expression of the form(cid:82) dadbq(ab)E(ab)

where E(ab) is the result of all the other integrations and it is thus an invariant. Since q(aa) = 0, it follows that
q(aa)E(aa) = 0 and therefore the condition (32) implies that the result is equal to zero when evaluated over an
invariant Q(ab). This implies that the result

L[q(ab)] = 0

(B1)

holds for any RS-like action, not only for the cubic actions considered here and also for any invariant q(ab), not only
for the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation. The above result is trivial in the replica case, it follows from the fact that
every RS term is proportional to n − 1 when evaluated on a RS matrix.

Neglecting irrelevant constants the gaussian correction to the mean-ﬁeld result ln Z = 0 is given by the trace of the
logarithm of the bare propagator, Tr ln G. We recall that G is a symmetric matrix on the vector space of symmetric
zero-diagonal matrices therefore ln G is also a matrix on this vector space. At this point it is important to realized
that the bare propagator G is a generalized invariant as a function of its four indexes. We know that it should be so
because of it is associated to an equilibrium four-time correlation, but one can also prove it self-consistently within
the theory noticing that it is the inverse of the mass matrix that it is itself an invariant for an RS-like action. It
follows that ln G is also a generalized invariant. On the other hand the trace of a linear operator A(ab)(cd) is given

by(cid:82) d(ab)A(ab)(ab), therefore if A(ab)(cd) is an invariant it follows that A(ab)(ab) is also an invariant and thus the

27

trace vanish. This is also true for the identity operator for which one has

TrI =

d(ab) = 0

according to eq. (32). It follows that the Gaussian correction is also exactly zero for a generic RS-like action:

1
2

Tr ln G = 0

(B3)
Again in the replica case this result is trivial because the trace of a RS operator M (ab)(cd) is proportional to n(n− 1).
Higher order corrections to ln Z are given by all connected vacuum (no external legs) diagrams, like the ones
shown in the ﬁrst line of ﬁg. (1). Given one these diagrams we have to multiply a propagator G(ab)(cd)for each
leg and then perform the integral over the indexes at the vertex. Since we have G(aa)(cd) = 0 the integrals can be
made on unrestricted indexes. We are integrating a product of generalized invariants thus the result before and after
each integration is also a generalized invariant. If we ﬁx a couple of indexes, say ab, on one internal line G(ab)(cd)
and integrate over all other indexes the result E(ab) will be an invariant with zero diagonal and therefore will give
a vanishing contribution after the ﬁnal integration over dadb according to (32).
It is clear that this result holds
because the bare propagator is invariant and the vertexes are RS-like and therefore it holds also for the generic action
containing all possible RS-like vertices. This shows that all vacuum diagrams generated by a RS-like action give
a vanishing contribution and complete the proof that Z = Zs = 1 exactly. Note that although we have derived
this property diagrammatically it appears to be intrinsically related to the system being at equilibrium. By similar
arguments one can show that the generic averages (30) generated by an RS-like action expanded near the dynamical
mean-ﬁeld solution are generalized invariants as expected on physical grounds.

The previous arguments can be also used to understand the necessary and suﬃcient condition for a non-vanishing
diagram discussed in subsection III C. Indeed a in the crossed line representation each crossed line give a factorized
contribution and can be opened and replaced with a source s that shift τ by an amount
v. Therefore one is left
with the evaluation of some disconnected diagrams. According to the discussion of the previous paragraph if one of
the disconnected diagrams has no external lines it is a diagram that contribute to ln Zs and therefore vanishes. This
implies that in the crossed line representation the necessary and suﬃcient condition for a graph to give a non-zero
contribution is that once the crossed lines are opened each diagram is connected to the external lines.

√

In principle the action (31) may contain additional cubic RS-like terms [19]. The presence of these terms therefore
does not alter the exact mapping between the GCT and the random GCT. At the level of the mean-ﬁeld equation
these terms however do not play any role, similarly to the term proportional to m2 and m3 and therefore they do not
play any role if the mapping to SBR is granted (e.g. for large values of M in the tunable models).
