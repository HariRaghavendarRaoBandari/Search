Abstract

By considering momentum transfer in the Fermi constraint procedure, the stability of the initial

nuclei and fragments produced in heavy-ion collisions can be further improved in the quantum

molecular dynamics simulations. The case of the phase space occupation probability larger than

one is eﬀectively reduced with the proposed procedure. Simultaneously, the energy conservation

can be better described for both individual nuclei and heavy-ion reactions. With the revised version

of the improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD) model, the fusion excitation functions of

16O+186W and the central collisions of Au+Au at 35 AMeV are re-examined. The fusion cross

sections at sub-barrier energies and the charge distribution of fragments are relatively better re-

produced due to the reduction of spurious nucleon emission. The charge and isotope distribution

of fragments in Xe+Sn, U+U and Zr+Sn at intermediate energies are also predicted. More unmea-

sured extremely neutron-rich fragments with Z = 16 − 28 are observed in the central collisions of

238U+238U than that of 96Zr+124Sn, which indicates that multi-fragmentation of U+U may oﬀer

a fruitful pathway to new neutron-rich isotopes.

I. INTRODUCTION

The microscopic dynamics simulations of heavy-ion collisions (HICs) are important not

only for the study of multi-fragmentation process at intermediate energies [1] but also for the

study of fusion reactions at energies near Coulomb barrier. The nuclear multi-fragmentation

process can be used to investigate the liquid-gas phase transition [2, 3], the mechanisms of

fragment production in highly excited nuclear systems [4–6], and as well as the equation of

state (EOS) in asymmetric nuclear matter, e.g. nuclear symmetry energy [8–10]. In addition,

the measurement for the reaction of 25 AMeV 86Kr+ 64Ni [11, 12] and the microscopic

dynamics simulations for Kr+Ni at energies well above the Coulomb barrier but below the

Fermi energy [13] indicates that this kind of reaction at this energy regime may oﬀer a fruitful

pathway to extremely neutron-rich nuclei, towards the neutron-drip line. It is known that

the masses of a large number of extremely neutron-rich nuclei such as three magic nuclei

46Si, 60Ca, 78Ni predicted by the Weizs¨acker-Skyrme (WS4) mass model [14, 15] have not yet

been measured, due to the diﬃculties in producing these nuclei and their short half-lives.

These extremely neutron-rich nuclei play an important role for testing nuclear mass models

and for exploring nuclear symmetry energy. The synthesis of very neutron-rich nuclides

through multi-fragmentation or deep inelastic transfer reactions are therefore of exceptional

importance to advance our understanding of nuclear structure at the extreme isospin limit

of the nuclear landscape.

Although the compression process and the multifragment de-excitation of hot compressed

composite nuclei formed in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate incident energies can be

reasonably well described by the statistical multi-fragmentation (SMM) model [16–18] and

some transport models such as the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model together

with a statistical decay model [19–21], the uncertainty of model predictions especially for the

primary fragments from diﬀerent transport models and the time to combining the statistical

decay model are still large. The stability of the initial nuclei and of primary fragments

produced in HICs should be further tested. As a semi-classical microscopic dynamics model,

the QMD model was proposed for simulating heavy-ion collisions at intermediate and high

energies. In the QMD model, no anti-symmetrization is carried out and its eﬀects are usually

simulated by using a phenomenological Pauli potential [22] and the collision term. To cure

the problem of Fermions in phase space, Reinhard and Suraud proposed a modiﬁcation

2

of the Vlasov equation which guarantees that the semiclassical dynamics obeys the Pauli

principle and relaxes towards a Fermi equilibrium, by introducing a dedicated collision term

[23]. For the purpose of simulating the Pauli exclusion principle, a momentum-dependent

two-body repulsion was introduced in Refs.[24–26]. Although the proposed Pauli potentials

and collision term met with some success, the stability of the model especially for describing

a bound nuclear system after a long time evolution should be further improved. The spurious

nucleon emission in heavy-ion reactions or in an individual heavy bound nucleus becomes

serious in the traditional QMD model after evolution of several hundreds fm/c, which causes

uncertainties in the description of the reaction yields and cross sections.

With great eﬀorts to develop the QMD model, some diﬀerent extended versions of the

QMD model such as IQMD [27, 28], CoMD [29–32], ImQMD [33–36], EQMD [37, 38]

and UrQMD [39, 40] have been proposed in the literature. To extend the QMD model

for the study of heavy-ion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier, the ImQMD

model was proposed in which the standard Skyrme force is adopted for describing not only

the bulk properties but also the surface properties of nuclei, and the phase-space occupa-

tion constraint method is used following the CoMD model to simulate the eﬀects of anti-

symmetrization and to improve the stability of an individual nucleus.
In this constraint
(also called Fermi constraint), the phase space occupation probability ¯fi of the i-th particle
is checked during the propagation of nucleons. If ¯fi > 1, the momentum of the particle i

is randomly changed by a series of two-body ”elastic scattering” between this particle and

its neighboring particles which is similar to the procedure in the traditional collision term

of QMD simulations but neglecting the inﬂuence of nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering cross

sections. The Pauli blocking condition is simultaneously checked after the momentum re-

distribution via the two-body ”elastic scattering”. For each NN collision we evaluate the

occupation probability after the ”elastic scattering”. If the occupation probabilities are both

less than one, the collision is accepted, and rejected otherwise. With these modiﬁcations in

the ImQMD model, the stability of the initial nuclei and fragments is signiﬁcantly improved

[41]. However, there is still a few spurious nucleon emissions for heavy bound systems after

time evolution of a few thousands fm/c and the total energy of the system slightly increases

due to the frequently abrupt change of particle momentum in the two-body ”elastic scatter-

ing”. If neglecting the Fermi constraint, the time evolution by classical equations of motion

in the QMD simulations surely breaks the initial Fermi-Dirac distribution which evolves

3

into a classical Boltzmann one [29]. The Fermi constraint adopted in the previous version

of ImQMD model mainly aﬀects the low momentum part of the momentum distribution.

The long tail (high momentum part) of the momentum distribution which is much longer

than that of the Fermi-Dirac distribution at low temperature can not be eﬀectively improved

since the phase space occupation probability of the particle with high momentum and low

density is generally smaller than one and cannot be constrained with the procedure. It is

therefore necessary to further improve the Fermi constraint for a better description of the

stability and energy conservation.

To further improve the stability of the initial nuclei and fragments, the Fermi constraint

procedure is modiﬁed in the version ImQMD-v2.2 [42] and the momentum transfer (similar

to the two-body inelastic scatter but without new particle production) in the momentum

re-distribution process is simultaneously considered in addition to the ”elastic scattering”

involved in v2.1. According to the Fermi-Dirac distribution at low temperature, the momenta

of any two neighboring nucleons in a nucleus or fragment should not deviate from each

other very large. If the diﬀerence between the momentum of a nucleon and that of its any

neighboring nucleons is larger than Fermi momentum, |~pi − ~pj| > pF , i = 1, 2...N, j 6= i, with

the Fermi momentum pF = 260 MeV/c, a tiny part of momentum ~pft of the nucleon with a

higher momentum will be transferred to the other one. For heavy-ion fusion reactions, the

transfer factor is set as ft = 5×10−6 for the parameter set IQ3a [41] which guarantees that the

total momentum and energy of the system are well conserved in the simulations. It was found

that the consideration of the momentum transfer in the Fermi constraint can signiﬁcantly

reduce the number of spurious emitted nucleons. It is interesting to investigate the inﬂuence

of this kind of momentum transfer on properties of nucleons and density evolution of reaction

system.

In this work, we further check the Fermionic properties of nucleons and energy conser-

vation in the nuclear system during the ImQMD simulations. Simultaneously, we system-

atically investigate the nuclear multi-fragmentation and new isotope production with the

ImQMD-v2.2 model. The structure of this paper is as follows: In sec. II, the mean-ﬁeld

part of the ImQMD model will be introduced. In sec. III, the fusion reaction 16O+186W

and the multi-fragmentation of 197Au+197Au at an incident energy of 35 AMeV will be re-

examined, and the energy conservation will be checked. In sec. IV, we investigate the charge

and isotope distribution of fragments in Xe+Sn, U+U and Zr+Sn at intermediate incident

4

energies. Finally a brief summary is given in Sec. IV.

II. MEAN-FIELD IN ImQMD

In the improved quantum molecular dynamics simulations, both the self-consistently

generated mean-ﬁeld and the momentum re-distribution in the Fermi constraint aﬀect the

movements of nucleons. For the mean-ﬁeld part, each nucleon is represented by a coherent

state of a Gaussian wave packet. The density distribution function ρ of a system reads

ρ(r) = Xi

where σr = σ0+σ1A1/3 represents the spatial spread of the wave packet [43]. The propagation

of nucleons is governed by the mean ﬁeld,

where ri and pi are the center of the i-th wave packet in the coordinate and momentum space,

respectively. Euler algorithm is adopted to compute new positions and momenta at time

t + ∆t. The time step in the ImQMD calculations is set as ∆t = 1 fm/c. The Hamiltonian

H consists of the kinetic energy T = Pi
2m and the eﬀective interaction potential energy U
which is written as the sum of the nuclear interaction potential energy Uloc = R Vloc(r)dr and

of the Coulomb interaction potential energy. Where Vloc(r) is the potential energy density

In the present calculations, the traditional collision term in the QMD simulations (in

which the free or in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross sections are involved) is

switched oﬀ and the initialization of the reaction partners is as follows: to obtain the reason-

able initial nuclei, the nucleon positions are sampled within two hard spheres in which the

neutron-skin thickness is simultaneously considered. With the sampled nucleon positions,

the nuclear potential energy of the nucleus can be calculated. The momentum of the i-th

nucleon is then sampled within the local Fermi sphere with a radius [3π2ρq(ri)]1/3 − wp,

where q = n for neutrons and q = p for protons. wp is to consider the inﬂuence of the width

of the wave-packet in the momentum space and its value is determined by the experimental

binding energy BE (in negative value) of the sampled nuclei. In this work, if the ground

state energy of the nucleus calculated falls into the range of BE ± 0.05 MeV and simul-

taneously the distance between any two identical nucleons in the phase space fulﬁlls the

fm/c are reduced by 50% (to 0.56) for 92Zr and 33% (to 1.75) for 132Sn, respectively. To

understand the reason for the reduction of the spurious emission, we investigate the density

distribution, momentum distribution and phase space occupation probability of nucleons in

an individual nucleus. We ﬁnd that the new Fermi constraint procedure does not signiﬁcantly

aﬀect the density and momentum distribution of the individual bound nuclei. However,
the phase space occupation probabilities ¯fi of nucleons are evidently inﬂuenced, and the
number of ”pseudo” nucleons (with ¯fi > 1) is eﬀectively suppressed. In this work, we check

the probability Pfi>1 of ”pseudo” nucleons in the individual nuclei.

In Fig. 1, we show

the time evolution of the probability Pfi>1 in 132Sn and 197Au. The circles and crosses

denote the results with and without the momentum transfer via ”inelastic scattering” being

considered, respectively. One can see from the ﬁgure that there are about 12% ”pseudo”

nucleons in the individual 132Sn and 16% in 197Au, if only the two-body ”elastic scattering”

being taken into account in the Fermi constraint (v2.1). When the momentum transfer

via ”inelastic scattering” is considered simultaneously, the number of ”pseudo” nucleons is

evidently reduced in both 132Sn and 197Au. It seems that the momentum re-distribution

improves the phase space occupation probability, which is helpful to further reduce the

spurious emission of nucleons in the bound nuclei. The time evolution of the binding energy

of the individual nuclei is also checked. In Fig. 2, we compare the time evolution of the

binding energy per particle of 132Sn and 197Au. We ﬁnd that energy conservation of bound

nuclei can be obviously improved with the new version (v2.2) of ImQMD, by considering

the momentum transfer and introducing a transfer factor ft with a ﬁxed value of 5 × 10−6

in the calculations.

With the ImQMD-v2.2 model, the fusion reaction of 16O+186W and the central collisions

of 197Au+197Au at an incident energy of 35 AMeV are re-examined. In Fig. 3, we show

the time evolution of the energy of the total reaction system. Similar to the cases for the

individual nuclei, the energy conservation can be better described comparing with the results

from the version v2.1. The ﬂuctuation of the binding energy at about 300 fm/c in Au+Au

is due to the violent compression process in which two-body ”scattering” strongly aﬀects

the propagation of nucleons at the densities much higher than the normal density. These

calculations indicate that the modiﬁcation of the Fermi constraint not only improves the

phase space occupation probability of nucleons, but also better describes the time evolution

of system energy. In addition, the fusion excitation function of 16O+186W is calculated with

the two versions of the ImQMD model. The calculation results are shown in Fig. 4. One

sees that at energies below the Coulomb barrier, the results from v2.2 are lower than those

from v2.1 due to the fewer spurious emission in the simulations of v2.2.

In Fig.

5, we show the charge distribution of

fragments in central collisions of

197Au+197Au at an incident energy of 35 MeV per particle and t = 2000 fm/c. The circles

in Fig. 5(a) denote the distributions of the primary fragments directly from the ImQMD

simulations. The curve denotes the experimental data [5]. One sees that for light and inter-

mediate fragments, the results from the two versions are close to each other very much. The

yields of heavy fragments from v2.2 are larger than those from v2.1 due to the reduction of

spurious nucleon emission. The experimental data are reproduced reasonably well. To fur-

ther investigate the inﬂuence of the secondary decay of the excited primary fragments, the

statistical model (GEMINI code with default values [47, 48]) is combined after the ImQMD

simulations. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 5(b). One sees that the exper-

imental data are relatively better reproduced with the version v2.2. We also note that the

results at t = 3000 fm/c are close to those at t = 2000 fm/c. To further see the inﬂuence

of the new Fermi constraint on the compression-expansion process, we investigate the time

evolution of density distribution in the HICs of Au+Au. In Fig. 6, we compare the density

of the reaction partners before touching conﬁguration are more spherical in v2.2 compar-

ing with those in v2.1. At t = 275 fm/c, the neck density is much higher in v2.2. In the

whole compression-expansion process, the elongation of reaction system along x-axis is more

evident in v2.1. It seems that the momentum re-distribution via the two-body ”inelastic

scattering” could also inﬂuence the angular distribution of fragments in the HICs.

IV. PRODUCTION OF NEW ISOTOPES IN MULTI-FRAGMENTATION

With the ImQMD-v2.2 model, we also study the production of new neutron-rich nuclides

in multi-fragmentation process of heavy-ion collisions. We ﬁrst investigate the charge and

isotope distribution of fragments in 129Xe+120Sn at incident energy of 50 AMeV, in which

the experimental data for the charge distribution are available. Here, we focus our investiga-

tions on the primary fragments produced at the central collisions, since the inﬂuence of the

secondary decay (e.g. ﬁssion of fragments) on the charge distribution for the intermediate

time evolution of a few hundreds fm/c. We ﬁnd that the predictions of the ImQMD model

are in good agreement with the data. In Fig. 7(b), we present the isotope distribution of

fragments in logarithmic scale. The solid curve denotes the positions of β-stability line de-

scribed by Green’s formula. We note that the number of neutron-rich fragments produced in

this reaction is larger than that of proton-rich ones. To produce new neutron-rich isotopes,

we also investigate the central collisions of 238U+238U and neutron-rich system 96Zr+124Sn.

Fig. 8 shows the isotope distribution of fragments in the central collisions of 238U+238U and

96Zr+124Sn at an incident energy of 35 AMeV. We create 20000 events for each reaction.

For each event, the microscopic dynamics process is self-consistently simulated till t = 2000

fm/c. Fig. 8 shows the calculated isotope distribution of primary fragments. The squares

present the positions of the three magic nuclei 46Si, 60Ca, 78Ni mentioned previously. From

Fig. 8, some unmeasured extremely neutron-rich fragments with Z = 16 − 28 can be evi-

dently observed in U+U reaction. However, for the central collisions of neutron-rich reaction

system 96Zr+124Sn, almost all fragments produced are located in the region where the nu-

clear masses have already been measured. The estimated production probability for the

unmeasured nuclei 60Ca and 78Ni is smaller than 5 × 10−5 in the cental collisions of U+U at

E = 35 AMeV. According to the predicted isotope distribution of U+U at 35 AMeV, the

production probability of 46Si might be much smaller than that of 78Ni.

FIG. 8: (Color online) Predicted isotope distribution of fragments in 238U+238U and 96Zr+124Sn

at an incident energy of 35 AMeV and b = 1 fm (in logarithmic scale). The curves denote the

β-stability line and the crosses denote the nuclei with known masses in AME2012 [50].

V. SUMMARY

In this work, the Fermionic properties of nucleons are investigated in the ImQMD simu-

lations and the multi-fragmentation process in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies

are explored for producing new neutron-rich isotopes. By introducing the momentum re-

distribution via two-body ”inelastic scattering” in the Fermi constraint procedure, the sta-

bility of initial nuclei and fragments is further improved. The number of ”pseudo” nucleons
(with ¯fi > 1) is eﬀectively suppressed with the modiﬁed procedure in the Fermi constraint.

Simultaneously, the energy conservation of the system is obviously improved in the heavy-ion

reactions and in the individual nuclei. With the revised version ImQMD-v2.2 of the model,

the fusion excitation functions of 16O+186W and the fragmentation in the central collisions

of Au+Au at 35 AMeV are re-examined, and the fusion cross sections at sub-barrier ener-

gies and the charge distribution of fragments are relatively better reproduced. In addition,

the charge and isotope distribution of fragments in Xe+Sn, U+U and Zr+Sn at interme-

diate incident energies are systematically investigated with the ImQMD-v2.2 model. Some

13

extremely neutron-rich fragments with Z = 16 − 28 are evidently observed in the central

collisions of 238U+238U at 35 AMeV, whereas in neutron-rich reaction system 96Zr+124Sn,

almost all fragments produced are located in the region with known masses.
