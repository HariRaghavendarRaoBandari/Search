Two-photon up-conversion aﬀected by inter-molecule correlations

near metallic nanostructure

We investigate an eﬃcient two-photon up-conversion process in more than one molecule cou-
pled to an optical antenna. In the previous work [Y. Osaka et al., PRL 112, 133601 (2014)], we
considered the two-photon up-conversion process in a single molecule within one-dimensional input-
output theory, and revealed that controlling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the eﬃcient
up-conversion with radiative loss in the antenna suppressed. In this work, aiming to propose a way
to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend the model to the case of
multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more than one molecule decreases the up-conversion
probability because they equally share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that
we can overcome the diﬃculty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies that,
without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can enlarge the net probability of
the two-photon up-conversion.

INTRODUCTION

Utilizing absorption saturation of discrete levels in
nanomaterials such as molecules and quantum dots is
a useful way to enhance optical nonlinearities by few
photons1. However, it is necessary to supplement small
absorption cross sections of nanomaterials for photons
with auxiliary systems because the size of nanomate-
rials is tiny compared to the spatial extent of photon
wave functions. Optical cavity is well-known as an ex-
ample of the auxiliary system to enhance interactions be-
tween photons and nanomaterials2,3. Another approach
is to introduce optical antenna that consists of metal-
lic nanostructures.
It produces electric ﬁelds localized
beyond the diﬀraction limit near the metal surface by lo-
calized surface plasmon resonance4,5. By embedding the
nanomaterials near the optical antenna, the nanomate-
rials strongly interact with the localized ﬁelds6,7. Espe-
cially, when metallic nanostructres are set at intervals of
a few nanometers, there exists a “hot spot” near the gap
region where the ﬁeld intensity is enhanced up to 105-
fold8. In such a hot spot, the conventional selection rules
of optical transitions are broken because of high gradient
intensity of the strongly localized ﬁeld9–11. In addition to
the potential as the optical antenna, surface plasmon has
a potential to combine an enormous capacity of photonics
and a miniaturization of electronics12–14. However, due
to the large radiative and nonradiative losses of the plas-
mon15–17, it is diﬃcult to eﬃciently excite nanomaterials
by weak light. If the losses in the antenna are successfully
suppressed, we can expect the antenna-assisted system
to be applied to key technologies in quantum informa-
tion, communication and computation such as visible-to-
telecom frequency conversion of single photons emitted
by a quantum dot18 and single-photon switch19,20.

In the previous work, we theoretically demonstrated
optical linear responses on a antenna-molecule coupled
system and reported that the molecule eﬃciently absorbs

the incident light energy with the loss in the antenna sup-
pressed. This is because the interference in the coupled
modes makes the antenna mode latescent21,22. More-
over, we revealed that this phenomenon is signiﬁcantly
beneﬁcial in nonlinear optical responses23. As a next
step toward applications, we have to explore the way
to enhance the total scattering probability between the
antenna-molecule coupled system and photons. Because
the wavelength of the photon is much larger than the
size of the coupled system, the antenna eﬀect is limited.
In order to overcome the diﬃculty, we consider larger
antenna-molecule coupled system involving more than
one molecule. However, the presence of more than one
molecule seems to disturbs nonlinear processes because of
the inhibition of photon-photon interaction in individual
molecules, i.e., the optical nonlinearity requires incident
light with higher intensity.

In this paper, we analyze the up-conversion process
by two photons in more than one molecule coupled to
an optical antenna in order to investigate the eﬀect of
the presence of the multi-molecules. In consequence, we
conﬁrm that the up-conversion probability under two-
photon irradiation decreases with increasing the num-
ber of molecules. However, we also ﬁnd that the up-
conversion eﬃciently occurs at the optimal inter-molecule
coupling. This is because the inter-molecule coupling
lifts the degeneracy of the energy levels of the molecu-
lar system so that the oﬀending interference due to the
presence of more than one molecule is avoided. Recently,
we reported that the radiation-induced coupling between
molecules nearby a metallic nanostructure can become
considerable even when the inter-molecule distance is
tens of nanometers24. This means that the inter-molecule
coupling in large antenna-molecule system is achievable.
These results indicate that controlling the inter-molecule
coupling provides high-eﬃcient few-photon nonlinear re-
sponses even in the multi-molecular system without in-
creasing the photon number. In addition, utilizing pho-

tons with quantum correlation for two-photon processes
has attracted much attention in terms of not only basic
science but also applications25–30, because entangled pho-
tons are key issues in quantum information technology31
and the generation eﬃciency of them is largely growing
recently32–35. Therefore, we also examine the dependence
of nonlinear optics on photon correlations, and ﬁnd that
the correlated photons facilitate the up-conversion pro-
cess.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we in-
troduce the theoretical formalism to analyze the two-
photon up-conversion process in the system where more
than molecule is coupled to a metallic nanoantenna.
In Sec. III, we show the numerically calculated up-
conversion probabilities, which is enhanced in the suit-
able conditions, and then discuss the essence of the en-
hancement. We also investigate the dependence of up-
conversion on the correlation between input photons.
Our summary and conclusion are provided in Sec. IV.

II. FORMALISM

A. Multi-molecular system coupled to an antenna

We consider the up-conversion process by two photons
in a multi-molecular system coupled to an optical an-
tenna. Although, in this section, we show the most sim-
ple case that the system contains two molecules and an
optical antenna, we can also analyze the up-conversion in
more than two molecules in the same manner. Therefore,
in the following sections, we show the results in the case
that the number of molecules is two, three, and four.

In Fig. 1(a), we show one example of the system setup.
The metallic nanoantenna has two hot spots near which
molecules are embedded. Such a nanoantenna is actually
fabricated using electron beam lithography and lift-oﬀ
technique36. In addition, the recent progress of nanofab-
rication techniques enables us to prepare arrays of metal-
lic nanostructures37–39. It should be noted that the typi-
cal size of the antennas is of the order of 100 nm, which is
small compared to a spatial extent of photons. Therefore,
even though the antenna includes more than one and sep-
arated hot spots, the excitation by a single photon must
be regarded as a single surface plasmon. Therefore, we
consider a simpliﬁed model shown in Fig. 1(b) (in the
case of two molecules). The antenna mode is modeled by
simple boson with the plasmon resonance frequency ωp
and the large radiative decay rate Γp. The molecule A(B)
is considered as a three-level system, in which the states
|mA(B)i and |eA(B)i are dipole-allowed from the ground
state |gA(B)i, and the transition between the state |eA(B)i
and |mA(B)i is dipole-forbidden owing to the parity of the
wave function. The radiative decay rates of the molecule
A(B) are denoted by {γ1A(B) , γ2A(B) , Γ3A(B)}, where the
rates of the forbidden transitions γ2A(B) are much smaller
than the ones of the allowed transitions {γ1A(B) , Γ3A(B)}.
We take the molecule-molecule coupling given by the con-

molecule A(B) {γ1A(B) , γ2A(B) , γ3A(B)} are set to be much
smaller compared with Γp. The constant gpA,pB and gM

pling between emitters located near surface of a metal or
graphene is enhanced through the plasmons24,40,41. The
constant gpA(B) denotes the coupling between the antenna
and the molecule A(B). The total Hamiltonian is

H =Hantenna + Hmolecule + Hphoton

+ Ha−p + Hm−p + Ha−m + Hm−m.

energies are measured from the ground state |gA(B)i.

transformation, e.g., ˜ak =p1/2πR drare−ikr. Input two

photons interact with the coupled system at the origin
(r = 0). The antenna-photon coupling is written within
rotating-wave approximation as

(2)

Ha−p = ipcΓp(p†ar=0 − a†

r=0p).

In the similar manner, the radiations of the photons from
the molecule are

+ h.c..

(3)

The interaction of the molecules with the plasmon ﬁeld
is described as

Ha−m =gpA (σAmgp + σAemp)

+ gpB (σBmgp + σBemp) + h.c.,

(4)

where the localized ﬁeld with spatial gradient is as-
sumed to produce similar intensities of absorptions in
both the dipole-allowed and -forbidden transitions9–11.
The molecule-molecule interaction via the radiation ﬁeld
is written as

Hm−m =gM (σAmgσBgm + σAmgσBme

+σAemσBgm + σAemσBme) + h.c..

(5)

It is known that the coupling between emitters located
near surface of a metal or a graphene is enhanced
through the plasmons40,41. Moreover, the coupling be-
tween molecules that are embedded near gaps of metallic
nanostructures is comparable in magnitude to plasmon-
molecule coupling even when the one molecule is sepa-
rated from the other molecule by tens of nanometers24.
Therefore, we can acquire the inter-molecule coupling of
the near order of the antenna-molecule coupling. We
analyze the up-conversion process by applying the input-
output formalism to this model.

On the other hand, the output state is a superposition

Therefore, the output state vector can be written as

be written as

In calculating the propagators, we employ the method

deﬁne the coherent state as

tial conditions, e.g., hσAge(0)iµ1µ2 = 0, we have solved
these simultaneous equations, and then determined the
propagator by substituting the solutions into Eq. (16).
Then, the up-conversion probability Puc and two-photon
emission probability Ptwo are calculated as

Puc = Z dr|h(r; τ )|2,
Ptwo = ZZ dr1dr2|g(r1, r2; τ )|2,

(19)

(20)

where they satisfy Puc + Ptwo = 1.

related (ρ = 0), and (c) spatially correlated (ρ = 0.8) states.

C.

Input two-photon with correlation

It is known that correlated photons enhance two-
photon process owing to allowing simultaneous excita-
tions, thus utilizing of photons with quantum correla-
tion for two-photon processes has attracted much atten-
tion25–30. Besides, because entangled photons are key
issues in quantum information technology31, the study
of nonlinear responses by the correlated photons is not
only interesting in itself, but also can contribute to fur-
ther development in photoscience. Therefore, in order to
discuss the eﬀect of the photon correlation for the nonlin-
ear process, we assume that the input two-photon wave
function is expressed by bi-variable Gaussian pulse as

f (r1, r2) =

exph− ¯r2

2 −2ρ¯r1 ¯r2

1+¯r2
4(1−ρ2)d2 + i ω0
(2π)1/2d(1 − ρ2)1/4

c (¯r1 + ¯r2)i

,

(21)

where ¯r = r − a is the distance from the initial posi-
tion a, and the parameter ρ denotes the correlation be-
tween two photons. The pulse length d corresponds to
the temporal coherence length of the photon, and recent
experiments reported that entangled photons or single
photon sources generate photons with the long coher-
ence length of 10−4 ∼ 102 m43–48. Although the coher-
ence length of sunlight is approximately several hundreds
of nanometers49, photons with that of the order of cm
are obtained by the spectral ﬁltering technique50. The
frequency of the pulse ω0 is set to the localized surface
plasmon resonance. Figure 2 shows the density plots
|f (r1, r2)|2 for the wave function at (a) ρ = −0.8, (b)
ρ = 0, and (c) ρ = 0.8. When the correlation parameter
ρ is equal to 0, the input two photons can be decoupled.
On the other hand, as ρ gets close to 1 (−1), they are
in strongly correlated (anti-correlated) state. Such an
entangled photon-pair can be actually generated using
spontaneous parametric down-conversion35. We discuss
the dependence of up-conversion processes on the corre-
lation of input two-photon in Sec. III C. In other sections,
we assume that input two-photon is non-correlated, i.e.,
ρ = 0.

III. ENHANCED UP-CONVERSION

We numerically calculate the probability of the up-
conversion in molecules coupled to an antenna. Here-
after we basically assume that the frequencies of the plas-
mon mode and molecules are set to be ωp = ωmA,mB =
ωeA,eB /2. Because the relaxation constant of the plas-
mon mode is large compared to the other rates, we
use Γ3A,3B /Γp = 0.2, γ1A,1B /Γp = 0.01, γ2A,2B /Γp =
0.001. In addition, for simplicity, we assume that both
the antenna-molecule coupling constants are equal, i.e.,
gpA = gpB = gp. We set the pulse length to be dΓp/c = 7,
which corresponds to d = 434 µm for Γp = 20 meV.

A. Eﬀect of inter-molecule correlation

FIG. 4: Coupling dependence of the up-conversion probabil-
ity on the two molecules, which are coupled to an antenna.
The probability is plotted against the antenna-molecule cou-
pling gp and the molecule-molecule coupling gM . We ﬁnd the
optimal ranges for both the couplings.

FIG. 3: Probability of up-conversion is plotted against the
antenna-molecule coupling at the inter-molecule coupling con-
stant (a) gM = 0 and (b) gM /Γp = 0.06. The solid,
dashed, and doted lines express the probability in the case
that the quantum complex system contains two molecules,
three molecules and one molecule, respectively. We ﬁnd that
although the probability reduces with increasing the number
of the molecules, the inter-molecule coupling enhances the
probability.

We investigate the eﬀects of the presence of more than
one molecule on the up-conversion process. The prob-
ability of the up-conversion for inter-molecule coupling
gM = 0 is shown in Fig. 3(a).
In the case of contain-
ing one molecule with in the quantum complex system
(black dotted line), we can see that the probability is en-
hanced at the optimal antenna-molecule coupling, where
the loss of the antenna is suppressed by the quantum in-
terference23. However, as the number of the molecules
within the quantum system increases, the up-conversion
probability decreases. This is because the second and
third molecules inhibit the process of two photons in a
molecule. On the other hand, Figure 3(b) shows the
probability of the up-conversion for inter-molecule cou-
pling gM /Γp = 0.06. In comparison with Fig. 3(a), it is

probability on the two molecules coupled to an antenna. The
probability is shown as functions of the molecule-molecule
coupling gM and the frequency detuning of the input photon

found that the optimal range of the coupling depends on the
frequency detuning.

found that the inter-molecule coupling enhance the prob-
ability. In order to examine the coupling dependence of
the up-conversion process, we show the probability as a
function of the molecule-molecule coupling. At ﬁrst, we
consider the up-conversion in two molecules, which are
coupled to an antenna. Figure 4 shows the probabil-
ity plotted against the antenna-molecule and molecule-
molecule coupling, and reveals that the up-conversion
is enhanced at both the optimal couplings.
In Fig. 5,
the probability is calculated as functions of the molecule-

FIG. 7: Eigenvalues of the coupled modes for the antenna-
molecule coupling constant (a) gp/Γp = 0.1, (b) gp/Γp =
1/4√2, and (c) gp/Γp = 0.3. Here the inter-molecule cou-
pling is ﬁxed to gM = 0. The horizontal axis is the detuning
between the resonant frequency of the antenna mode and that
of the ﬁrst excited state of the molecule |mA(B)i. The upper
(lower) three ﬁgures show the real (imaginary) part of the
eigenmodes. This complex frequency of the dark mode is al-
ways constant because it does not include the antenna mode.
In the upper ﬁgures, one can ﬁnd an anti-crossing (Rabi split-
ting) when gp/Γp is larger than 1/4√2. On the other hand,
when gp/Γp is smaller than 1/4√2, one can ﬁnd a crossing.
Then, the energies of upper and lower branches become equal
at ωp = ωm. In the lower ﬁgures, one can ﬁnd a crossing when
gp/Γp is larger than 1/4√2. Then, the radiative decay rate of
upper and lower branches become equal at ωp = ωm. There-
fore, the two bright modes oscillate in the same frequency and
with the same time constant at gp/Γp = 1/4√2 and ωp = ωm.
This is the condition for the quantum interference in the cou-
pled system.

(imaginary) part of eigenmodes, which corresponds to
the frequency (decay rate) of the coupled modes. Here,
this complex frequency of the dark mode is always con-
stant because it does not include the antenna mode.
The other two modes eﬃciently interfere constructively
and destructively at the crossing point, which appears
at the optimal antenna-molecule coupling. This is be-
cause the two modes oscillate in the same frequency and
with the same time constant. Owing to this quantum
interference in the coupled system, when the destruc-
tive interference occur in the antenna mode, it is pos-
sible to make only the molecular polarization oscillate.
Then, the large loss in antenna is suppressed and we can
achieve the eﬃcient few-photon nonlinear responses23.
However, in the case that more than one molecule is
present, these conditions are not suﬃcient to induce the
high-eﬃcient up-conversion. The reason is explained as
follows. Because input two-photon interacts with a num-
ber of molecules, the expected values of the population
of the individual molecules decrease. Therefore, whereas
photons eﬃciently excite a number of molecules owing to
this quantum interference, strong photon-photon interac-
tion in one molecule, which is of importance to nonlinear
optical processes, is inhibited. Figure 3(a) corresponds
to the above case.

pling gM in the case of containing (a) three molecules and (b)
four molecules within the coupled system.

molecule coupling gM and the detuning of the input pho-
ton energy from the resonances of the plasmon and the
molecule. This result states that the optimal range of
the coupling depends on the frequency detuning. Figure
6 shows the couplings dependence of the up-conversion
probability in the case of containing more than two
molecules within the coupled system. As is the case in
Fig. 4, it is conﬁrmed that there are the optimal ranges of
the both couplings. These results mean that controlling
both the antenna-molecule and the inter-molecule cou-
plings leads to high-eﬃcient up-conversion even though
the number of molecule is more than two.

eigenmodes. In the upper ﬁgures, it is found that the cross-
ing point shifts due to the splitting of the mode frequencies
induced by the molecule-molecule coupling. Accordingly, the
oﬀending interference from the other molecule is avoided.

Figure 8 shows the real and imaginary parts of the
eigenmodes for the diﬀerent molecule-molecule coupling
constants gM , where antenna-molecule coupling is ﬁxed
to gp = 1/4√2. From the upper and lower ﬁgures, one
can see that the crossing point shifts with increasing
the molecule-molecule coupling. This shift is due to the
splitting of the molecular modes induced by the inter-
molecule coupling. Actually, Figure 5 shows that the
optimal energy of input photons for the up-conversion
moves to the higher frequency side with increasing the
inter-molecule coupling. From these results, we interpret
that the degeneracy of the molecular levels is lifted by the
inter-molecule coupling so that the oﬀending interference
due to the presence of more than one molecule is avoided.
Therefore, by controlling both the antenna-molecule cou-
pling and the molecule-molecule coupling, we can achieve
the eﬃcient few-photon nonlinear responses in the pres-
ence of a number of the molecule.

tially. The sequential excitation is of importance to the
up-conversion process. Accordingly, the correlation of in-
put photons spreads the optimal regime of the antenna-
molecule and molecule-molecule coupling for the eﬃcient
up-conversion.

C. Dependence on correlation of input photons

IV. CONCLUSION

We discuss the dependence of the up-conversion on cor-
relations between input two photons. In Fig. 9(a), the
up-conversion probability is plotted as a function of the
input two-photon correlation and the antenna-molecule
coupling.
In Fig. 9(b), the probability is plotted as a
function of the input two-photon correlation and the
molecule-molecule coupling. These ﬁgures show that the
up-conversion process is facilitated when input two pho-
tons are correlated in space, i.e., the correlation param-
eter ρ is close to 1. This is because the spatial correla-
tion allows two photons to interact the coupled system
almost simultaneously and excite the molecules sequen-

Larger antenna-molecule coupled system, which in-
volves more than one molecule, is suitable in order to
enlarge the total scattering probability between photons
with micrometer-scale wavelength and molecules nearby
nanometer-scale metallic antennas. However, the pres-
ence of multiple molecules seems to damage nonlinear
optical processes because of the inhibition of photon-
photon interaction in one molecule, when the system
is irradiated by weak light, which contains only a few
photons. Therefore, we have theoretically studied two-
photon up-conversion in a quantum complex system
where more than one molecule is coupled to a metal-

lic nanoantenna. As a result, we have conﬁrmed that
the probability decreases with increasing the number of
the molecules. However, we have shown that controlling
the inter-molecule coupling, which is enhanced near the
metallic nanoantenna, resolves the diﬃculty by lifting the
degeneracy of the energy levels of the molecular system.
Therefore the total design of the antenna-molecule and
inter-molecular coupling enhances few-photon nonlinear
responses in the large antenna-molecule coupled system.
These results will open new avenues for nonlinear optical
devices to realize single-photon control techniques, e.g.,

wavelength conversion of single photons and single pho-
ton switching.
