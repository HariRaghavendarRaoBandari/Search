Abstract

We derive the four-dimensional low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory governing the moduli space of
strongly coupled superconformal quiver gauge theories associated with D3-branes at Calabi-
Yau conical singularities in the holographic regime of validity. We use the dual supergravity
description provided by warped resolved conical geometries with mobile D3-branes. Information
on the baryonic directions of the moduli space is also obtained by using wrapped Euclidean
D3-branes. We illustrate our general results by discussing in detail their application to the
Klebanov-Witten model.

Introduction

Since its ﬁrst explicit incarnation in string theory [1], holography has been realised in
a huge number of possible string/M-theory models, which are dual to various strongly
coupled theories, either conformal or not. The correspondence has been tested and ex-
tended in an impressing number of possible ways. However there are still many potential
applications of holography to the study of the dynamics of strongly coupled systems.

Consider a strongly coupled theory with a non-trivial moduli space of vacua. If at a
generic vacuum the only massless states are given by the moduli, one expects the low-
energy physics to be codiﬁed by an appropriate eﬀective ﬁeld theory for them. In absence
of a suﬃcient number of (super)symmetries, a purely ﬁeld-theoretical identiﬁcation of
such eﬀective ﬁeld theory constitutes a general hard problem. For instance, in four-
dimensional N = 1 models, while supersymmetry signiﬁcantly helps the evaluation of
the F-terms of the eﬀective theory, there is no general clue on how to face the D-terms
directly in ﬁeld theory. Holography provides a natural alternative strategy. If the theory
admits a holographic dual, one may use it to identify the eﬀective ﬁeld theory, which
we will refer to as the holographic eﬀective ﬁeld theory (HEFT). The aim of the present
paper is to systematically explore this opportunity for a certain broad class of string
theory holographic models.

We will focus on the four-dimensional N = 1 superconformal ﬁeld theories (CFTs)
which can be engineered by placing N D3-branes at the tip of a six-dimensional cone
C(Y ) over a Sasaki-Einstein space Y . Such theories are microscopically described by
N = 1 quiver gauge theories that RG-ﬂow to a ﬁxed point at which the theories become
superconformal. The prototypical example is provided by the Klebanov-Witten (KW)
model [2], which has been generalised in various ways. All these theories have a rich
moduli space of supersymmetric vacua at which some chiral operators get a non-vanishing
vacuum expectation value (vev), the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken and
the dynamics is expected to be describable by an N = 1 eﬀective ﬁeld theory. Thus,
they constitute an ideal laboratory to put the above strategy into practice and, indeed,
we will show how to compute their HEFT.

The holographic realisation of the spontaneously broken phases for our class of models
has been discussed in [3, 4] in the KW model and generalized in [5]. The ten-dimensional
metric is most naturally described as a deformation of AdS5 × Y in Poincar´e coordinates
and contains an internal non-compact warped Calabi-Yau space X. The warping is
sourced by N mobile D3-branes, while X is a resolution of C(Y ).
In particular, the
resolution parameters are naturally associated with the vev of certain baryonic operators
and one can choose them so that the supergravity description of the internal space X is
justiﬁed.

The moduli of these string backgrounds clearly provide the holographic counterpart

3

of the moduli of the dual CFT. These moduli may be regarded as the moduli of a
warped ﬂux compactiﬁcation of the kind described in [6] in which the internal space
has been eventually decompactiﬁed, so to get an inﬁnite four-dimensional Planck mass.
This viewpoint will help us to identify the Lagrangian of the HEFT by starting from
the eﬀective four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity for ﬂux compactiﬁcations found in [7],
which consistently incorporates the eﬀect of ﬂuxes, warping and mobile D3-branes.

We will also investigate the explicit connection between the chiral ﬁelds entering
the HEFT and the vevs of the CFT operators, since the latter should be completely
determined by the former. In this regard, the baryonic operators are particularly subtle.
Still, we will show that a calculation along the lines of [4], see also [5], leads to an explicit
general formula for the baryonic vevs in terms of the HEFT chiral ﬁelds.

Our general results will be explicitly applied to the KW model. We will identify its
HEFT, explaining in some detail the relation with the dual CFT. This will be suﬃcient
to illustrate some key aspects of the general procedure. On the other hand, other models
possess important properties, as for instance the presence of anomalous baryonic sym-
metries, which are not shared by the KW model. These would require a further in-depth
analysis through the investigation of the HEFT of more general explicit models, which
we leave to the future.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the structure of the su-
pergravity vacua we are interested in, corresponding to D3-branes moving on a smooth
non-compact Calabi-Yau. In Section 3 we describe the HEFT, introducing the appro-
priate chiral moduli and presenting the associated K¨alher potential. We also provide an
alternative description of the moduli space in terms of complex-symplectic coordinates.
In Section 4 we compare the HEFT with the dual CFT expectations. In Section 5 we
discuss how to extract baryonic vevs from Euclidean D3-branes, along the lines of [4]. In
Section 6 we illustrate our general results by discussing in detail the Klebanov-Witten
model. Section 7 contains some concluding remarks. Finally, a series of Appendices
containing technical details end the paper.

2 Structure and properties of the string vacua

In this section we describe the general string backgrounds we focus on in the present paper
and discuss the geometrical properties that will be relevant in the following sections.

2.1 Supergravity backgrounds

In this paper we focus on non-compact type IIB backgrounds with Einstein-frame metric

The internal space X is assumed to be a smooth Calabi-Yau that can be obtained
by a crepant resolution of a Calabi-Yau cone C(Y ) over a Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifold Y .
The metric on the singular cone C(Y ) can be written as

See [8] for a discussion on existence and properties of the Green’s function on this class
of non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces.

2.2 Topology, couplings and axionic moduli

The couplings and the closed string axionic moduli of the above class of backgrounds can
be partly identiﬁed by purely topological arguments. The topological properties of X,
which should be regarded as a space with boundary ∂X ≡ Y , are discussed in details in
[5]. Here we review some relevant information.

Every ﬁve-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space Y has the following vanishing Betti num-

bers

which follows from the fact that Y has positive Ricci curvature and Myers’ theorem. On
the other hand, it was proven in [9] that X has vanishing Betti numbers

b1(Y ) = b4(Y ) = 0 ,

(2.11)

b1(X) = b5(X) = b6(X) = 0 .

In addition, we also assume that X has vanishing

b3(X) = 0 .

(2.12)

(2.13)

Such condition, together with (2.12), imply that no four-dimensional particles or domain-
walls can be obtained by wrapping D1-, D3- or D5-branes on one-, three or ﬁve-cycles.
Flat shifts of the gauge potentials B2, C2 and C4 give rise to (non-dynamical) param-
eters and (dynamical) closed string moduli characterising the vacua. Let us start with
B2, C2. Arbitrary ﬂat shifts of these ﬁelds are parametrised by H 2(X; R), but integral
large gauge transformations make them periodic, so that they actually take values in a
b2(X)-dimensional torus.2 Since b1(Y ) = b3(X) = 0, H 1(Y ; R) = H 3(X, Y ; R) = 0 3 and
2 Large gauge transformations of B2 are given by the elements of H 2(X; Z), so that the corresponding
b2(X)-dimensional torus is H 2(X; R)/H 2(X; Z). On the other hand, we avoid writing down the precise
periodicities of the R-R ﬁelds Ck since they are better speciﬁed in the K-theory framework [10] and so,
generically, they cannot be just identiﬁed with the corresponding integral cohomology groups.

3Recall that, for any n-dimensional manifold M with boundary ∂M , Hk(M, ∂M ; Z) describe equiv-

6

we can write the short exact sequence

0 −→ H 2(X, Y ; R) −→ H 2(X; R) −→ H 2(Y ; R) −→ 0 ,

(2.14)
which shows that H 2(X; R) splits into the sum of a ‘boundary’ component H 2(Y ; R) (cid:39)
H3(Y ; R) and a ‘bulk’ component H 2(X, Y ; R) (cid:39) H4(X; R). Hence there are

b2(X) = b3(Y ) + b4(X)

(2.15)
possible deformations of the complex combination C2−τ B2. The deformations counted by
b3(Y ) are non-dynamical and combine with the axio-dilaton τ to give in total b3(Y ) + 1
free complex parameters distinguishing these backgrounds. They can be measured by
integrating C2 − τ B2 on two-cycles contained in Y and, as we will discuss later, they
correspond to the marginal holomorphic gauge couplings in the dual gauge theory. On
the other hand, the deformations of C2 and B2 counted by b4(X) can be considered as
compactly supported and they give in total 2b4(X) dynamical real moduli.

Let us now turn to the moduli associated with C4. A ﬁrst set of such moduli is
parametrised by H 4(X; R) (up to periodic identiﬁcations due to the large gauge trans-
formations). Since b3(X) = b4(Y ) = 0 we can write the short exact sequence

0 −→ H 3(Y ; R) −→ H 4(X, Y ; R) −→ H 4(X; R) −→ 0 ,

(2.16)

which tells us that such b4(X) ﬂat deformations of C4 can be in fact uplifted to com-
pactly supported ones. On the other hand, a key general result of [5] is that, with the
speciﬁc warping boundary condition (2.5), there are additional b3(Y ) C4-moduli. They
correspond to exact shifts ∆C4 = dΛ3 which are compactly supported while Λ3 is not.
Hence Λ3|Y (cid:54)= 0 and dΛ3|Y = 0, so that Λ3|Y parametrise the group H 3(Y ; R) appearing
in (2.16). From (2.16), we can then conclude that there is a total of

dim H 4(X, Y ; R) = dim H2(X; R) = b2(X) = b3(Y ) + b4(X) ,

(2.17)

real C4 moduli.

In the toric case, the crepant resolutions of the toric singular cone C(Y ) can be de-
scribed in terms of the toric diagram 4 which is a convex polygon in the plane with d
alence classes of chains in M which can have a non-trivial boundary on ∂M while H k(M, ∂M ; Z) can
be represented by compactly supported closed k-forms, modulo exact forms dΛk−1, with Λk−1 com-
pactly supported. The (relative) homology groups are related to the (relative) cohomology groups by
Poncar´e duality and the universal coeﬃcients theorem, see e.g. [11]: Hk(M ; Z) (cid:39) H n−k(M, ∂M ; Z),
Hk(M, ∂M ; Z) (cid:39) H n−k(M ; Z) and, modding out the torsion component, Hk(X, Z)free (cid:39) H k(X, Z)free.
4A singular Calabi-Yau toric cone C(Y ) is described by a convex rational cone in R3 generated by
d integral vectors wA ∈ Z3 which lie on a plane in R3. The toric diagram is the convex polygon with
integral vertices that is obtained by projecting the fan on the plane.

integral vertices. The smooth crepant resolutions X of C(Y ) are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the complete triangulations of the toric diagram, where again all triangles
should have integral vertices. If we call I the number of points with integer coordinates
enclosed in the toric diagram, b3(Y ) is given by d − 3, while b4(X) is given by I.

2.3 K¨ahler moduli and harmonic forms

Because of the assumption (2.13), the internal K¨ahler space X has no complex structure
moduli. On the other hand, according to the existence theorems of [12, 13], in any class
of H 2(X; R) there exists a Ricci ﬂat K¨ahler form J which has the appropriate asymptotic
conical behaviour. This means that we can expand the K¨ahler cohomological class [J] as
follows

[J] = va[ωa] ,

(2.18)
where [ωa], a = 1, . . . , b2(X), is a basis of H 2(X; Z). On the one hand, this implies that
∂[J]
∂va = [ωa]. An inﬁnitesimal variation δJ of the K¨ahler form gives a harmonic (1,1) form
[14]. Hence, there must exist a set of harmonic (1,1) forms ωa which are representatives
of the integral cohomology classes [ωa] ∈ H 2(X; Z) and are such that5

The quantisation condition [ωa] ∈ H 2(X; Z) then reads(cid:82)

∂J
∂va = ωa .

In particular, by introducing a basis of two-cycles C a, we must have

C ωa ∈ Z for any two-cycle C.

(cid:90)

b ≡

N a

ωb ∈ Z .

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

In turn, we can write (2.18) in terms of diﬀerential forms as follows

Ca

J = J0 + vaωa ,

where J0 is an exact (1,1) form. Viceversa, if one knows a general parametrisation of
the K¨ahler form J, one can vary it to generate a basis of b2(X) harmonic forms and
then select the appropriate K¨ahler moduli va by imposing (2.19) for a set of harmonic
forms ωa satisfying the quantisation condition (2.20). Notice that the forms ωa, being
harmonic, depend on the K¨ahler moduli va (while their homology classes do not) as well
as J0. Consistency between (2.19) and (2.21) requires that

∂J0

∂va = −vb ∂ωb
∂va .

(2.22)

5More precisely, one should ﬁx a complex coordinate system, write J = Ji¯ dzi∧d¯z¯, and then identify

ωa = ∂Ji¯

∂va dzi ∧ d¯z¯.

8

(cid:90)

Now, because of (2.14) (or, rather, its integral counterpart), we should be able to
split ωa in two sets ˆωα and ˜ωσ, with α = 1, . . . , b4(X) and σ = 1, . . . , b3(Y ), providing
a basis of harmonic representative of H 2(X, Y ; Z) and of the non-compactly supported
elements of H 2(X; Z), respectively.6 Indeed, it is known [15] that H 2(X, Y ; Z) admits a
representation in terms of L2-normalisable harmonic forms, that is, the b4(X) harmonic
forms ˆωα satisfy the normalisation condition

ˆωα ∧ ∗ˆωβ < ∞ .

(2.23)

Actually, one can identify the asymptotic behaviour [5]

X

(2.24)
in the limit r → ∞, where (cid:107)ˆωα(cid:107)2 ≡ ˆωα(cid:121)ˆωα and µ > 0. Clearly (2.24) is compatible with
(2.23).

(cid:107)ˆωα(cid:107)2 ∼ 1
r8+µ

On the other hand, the b3(Y ) harmonic forms ˜ωσ are not L2-normalisable. However,
by using the fact that ˜ωσ asymptotically deﬁne a non-trivial element of H 2(Y ; Z), one
can argue that [5]

(2.25)

(cid:107)˜ωσ(cid:107)2 ∼ 1
r4 .

(cid:90)

This implies that the forms ˜ωρ are normalisable with respect to the warped inner product

e−4A ˜ωρ ∧ ∗˜ωσ < ∞ .

(2.26)

X

We then say that ˜ωρ are Lw
2 -normalisable. Notice that (2.26) is possible only because
of the speciﬁc asymptotic behaviour (2.5) of warping. With an additional constant con-
tribution to e−4A, as it would happen in local models of ﬂux compactiﬁcations (without
taking the near-horizon limit), (2.26) would not hold anymore.

An important observation is that all harmonic 2-forms ωa = (ˆωα, ˜ωσ) are primitive.
Indeed, we can decompose ωa in primitive and non-primitive part, ωa = ωP
a + αaJ, so
a (cid:107)2 + 3(αa)2. Consistency with (2.24) and (2.25) requires that (αa)2
that (cid:107)ωa(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)ωP
3J(cid:121)ωa is a regular harmonic function,
decreases at least as r−4. On the other hand αa = 1
since the contraction with the K¨ahler form J commutes with the Laplacian. Hence αa
necessarily vanishes and ωa is primitive.

6Notice that ˆωα span a cononically deﬁned subspace H 2(X, Y ; Z) ⊂ H 2(X; Z), while the non-
compactly supported basis ˜ωσ canonically span only the quotient space H 2(X; R)/H 2(X, Y ; R) and
so they can be identiﬁed at most up to possible mixed redeﬁnitions ˜ωσ → ˜ωσ + nα
σ ∈ Z. Such
redeﬁnition would imply the mixed redeﬁnition ˆvα → ˆvα − nα

σ ˆωα, with nα

σ ˜vσ of the K¨ahler moduli.

9

(cid:90)

Gab =

(cid:90)

Notice that, of course, the forms ˆωα are Lw

2 -normalisable too, which is consistent with
the fact that the forms ˜ωσ are deﬁned up to linear combinations of ˆωα (see footnote 6).
In particular, this implies that the matrix

e−4Aωa ∧ ∗ωb ≡ −

e−4AJ ∧ ωa ∧ ωb

(2.27)

X

X

is well deﬁned and non-degenerate and can be regarded as a positive deﬁnite metric on
the b2(X)-dimensional space spanned by the complete set of harmonic forms ωa.

In [9] it is shown that H 2(X; Z) is isomorphic to the Picard group of holomorphic
line bundles. This implies that the harmonic forms ωa can be chosen to be Poincar´e
dual to a basis of divisors Da = ( ˆDα, ˜Dσ), which explicitly realise the Poincar´e duality
H 2(X; Z) (cid:39) H4(X, Y ; Z).
In particular, the forms ˆωα are dual to a basis of compact
divisors ˆDα, while ˜ωσ are dual to non-compact divisors ˜Dσ whose boundary ∂ ˜Dσ ⊂ Y
deﬁne non-trivial non-torsional classes in H3(Y ; Z). Furthermore, the matrix (2.20) can
be represented as intersection matrix N a

b = C a · Db.

Since the (1, 1) form J0 appearing in (2.21) is exact, we can write it as7

J0 = i∂ ¯∂k0 ,

(2.28)

where k0 is a globally deﬁned real function. Notice that k0 depends not only on the
coordinates but also on the K¨ahler moduli va and then we will sometime more explicitly
write k0(z, ¯z; v). As we will see, this function plays a crucial role in the description of
the low-energy eﬀective theory describing these vacua.

Analogously, we can introduce the potentials κa(z, ¯z; v) such that

(2.29)
Since ωa deﬁne non-trivial classes in H 2(X; Z), κa(z, ¯z; v) are only locally deﬁned. In
fact, we can regard e−2πκa as a metric on the line bundle O(Da). More explicitly, if
κa(z, ¯z; v) has transition functions

ωa = i∂ ¯∂κa .

κa(z, ¯z; v) −→ κa(z, ¯z; v) + χa(z) + ¯χa(¯z) ,

then a section of the corresponding line bundle O(Da) must transform as

ζa(z) −→ e2πχa(z)ζa(z) .

(2.30)

(2.31)

7Indeed, we can globally write J0 = ∂θ0,1 + ¯∂ ¯θ0,1 with ¯∂θ0,1 = 0. On the other hand, by Lemma 5.5
of [12] we can write θ0,1 = ¯∂f for some globally deﬁned function f so that J0 = ∂ ¯∂f + ¯∂∂ ¯f = 2i∂ ¯∂Im f .
We can then set 2Im f ≡ k0 and obtain (2.28).

10

Notice that k0(z, ¯z; v), as well as each potential κa(z, ¯z; v), is deﬁned up to a v-
dependent function which does not depend on the coordinates. We partially ﬁx such
ambiguity by requiring that

∂k0

∂va = −vb ∂κb
∂va ,

which is indeed compatible with (2.22). Hence, the asymptotic behaviour of ∂k0
∂va is dic-
tated by the asymptotic behaviour of the globally deﬁned functions ∂κb
∂va , which we ﬁx
as follows. By adapting to the present context an an argument given in [7], we ﬁrst
observe that the primitivity of ωa requires, by consistency, that ∂(J(cid:121)ωa)
∂vb = 0. Now,
∂va = −(ωa)i¯ and then
from ∂Ji¯
∂vb = −ωa(cid:121)ωb + J(cid:121) ∂ωa
∂vb ≡ − 1
∂(J(cid:121)ωa)
∂vb , where
∆ ≡ −2iJ(cid:121)∂ ¯∂ is the Laplacian associated with the Calabi-Yau metric on X, so that we
see that the above consistency condition can be written in the form

∂vb . On the other hand J(cid:121) ∂ωa

Since G(x; x(cid:48)) ∼ 1
for r → ∞, the integral on the r.h.s. of (2.34) is indeed well deﬁned.

r(cid:48)4 and J ∧ ωa ∧ ωb ≡ −ωa(cid:121)ωbdvolX diverges slower than r(cid:48)dr(cid:48) ∧ dvolY

Since ωa has speciﬁc boundary conditions (2.24) and (2.25), we see that (2.34) implies

that ∂κa

(2.35)

These boundary conditions as well as (2.32) almost completely ﬁx the possible ambiguity
in k0(z, ¯z; v) and κa(z, ¯z; v), so that each of these functions is now uniquely deﬁned up
to a possible additive constant.

3 The holographic eﬀective ﬁeld theory

We now turn to the supersymmetric holographic eﬀective ﬁeld theory (HEFT) describing
the low-energy dynamics of the supergravity vacua. We obtain it by considering an
appropriate rigid limit of the warped supergravity derived in [7]. A general discussion of
such procedure, which may be applied for more general non-compact warped F-theory
backgrounds, is presented in appendix A. Here we summarise the main points, restricting
the discussion to the holographic vacua which this paper is focused on.

3.1 Chiral moduli

Let us ﬁrst organise the spectrum of the moduli in chiral ﬁelds. There are 3N chiral
ﬁelds zi
I, I = 1, . . . , N , describing the position of the N D3-branes on X in some complex
coordinate system zi. In addition, there are the closed string moduli described in the
previous section. All the moduli can be organised in the chiral ﬁelds summarised in the
following table

Table 1: Chiral ﬁelds parametrising open and closed string moduli.

The chiral ﬁelds βα are obtained by expanding B2 and C2 in the basis of b2(X) =

b4(X) + b2(Y ) harmonic two-forms ωa = (ˆωα, ˜ωσ):

C2 − τ B2 = (cid:96)2

(3.1)

Here λσ denote the non-dynamical complex parameters which, together with the axio-
dilaton τ , parametrise the non-dynamical 1 + b3(Y ) marginal deformations of the back-
ground.

The chiral ﬁelds Reρa and Imρa provide an alternative parametrisation of the K¨ahler
moduli va and the C4 moduli, respectively. At the moment, we just need the explicit
parametrisation of the Reρa:

Iaαβ ≡

ωa ∧ ˆωα ∧ ˆωβ ,

Iaασ ≡

ωa ∧ ˆωα ∧ ˜ωσ .

(3.3)

X

By using the asymptotic behaviours (2.24) and (2.25), one can indeed check that the
above integrals are ﬁnite. Notice that, as already remarked above, the potentials κa(zI, ¯zI; v)
are deﬁned only up to an additive constant, and so is Reρa. The same is true for Imρa,

12

which can be roughly identiﬁed with the expansion coeﬃcients of a ﬂat variation of C4
in a basis of b2(X) four-forms. These forms are dual, in some appropriate sense, to the
harmonic two-forms ωa. Their precise deﬁnition is complicated by the presence of the
non-trivial self-dual ﬁeld-strength F5, but fortunately we will not need it in the following.
A more explicit description of Imρa can be found in Appendix C.

To explicitly see that Reρa provide an alternative parametrisation of the K¨ahler
moduli, we now show that the relations (3.2) can be in principle inverted into relations
expressing va as functions of Reρa, Imβα, zi

(3.5) shows that one can invert the relations (3.2).

3.2 Eﬀective action and K¨ahler potential

We are now ready to discuss the low-energy eﬀective theory. Let us assume that all
the D3-branes in the bulk are not mutually coincident and furthermore that the K¨ahler
metric on X is smooth enough to justify the validity of the two-derivative ten-dimensional
IIB supergravity.8

The eﬀective action can be obtained from the rigid/decompactiﬁcation limit of the
supergravity action derived in [7] – see appendix A. One can then write the HEFT
Lagrangian as

8In fact, the warping becomes very curved close to the isolated D3-branes, which would suggest
a breaking of the leading ten-dimensional supergravity approximation. However, such local geometry
is well approximated by a highly curved maximally supersymmetric AdS5 × S5 background, which is
known to be an exact solution of string theory [16]. This suggests that the two-derivative supergravity
approximation may be used, for our purposes, beyond its most naive regime of validity, and we will be
working with this implicit assumption. See Section 7 for more comments on this point.

The kinetic matrices Gab and Mαβ are ﬁnite exactly because of the conditions (2.23)
and (2.26). Furthermore, note that the kinetic metric for the D3-brane chiral ﬁelds zi
I is
the natural covariant extension of the Calabi-Yau metric on X. This matches the result
obtained by expanding the DBI action of a probe D3-brane and provides a non-trivial
consistency check of the validity of our HEFT.

It remains to show that the eﬀective action (3.8) is consistent with supersymmetry.
This is obvious for LYM, while it is less trivial to demonstrate that we can write Lchiral
in the superspace form

presently show, such K¨ahler potential exists and admits the following simple expression
in terms of the globally deﬁned function k0(z, ¯z; v) introduced in section 2.3:

K = 2π

Notice that this K¨ahler potential is only implicitly deﬁned. Indeed, it depends on the
chiral ﬁelds also through the dependence on the K¨ahler moduli va, which should be
expressed as functions of the chiral ﬁelds ρa, βα and zi

From (3.12), (3.13) and (3.14) and taking into account that K depends on (ρa, ¯ρa) only

Notice that the HEFT described here does not include possible perturbative as well
as non-perturbative string corrections. We postpone to Section 7 more comments on
such corrections. For the moment we just observe that non-perturbative corrections may
a priori generate a non-trivial superpotential, which would signiﬁcantly modify the vac-
uum structure of the HEFT. In the present setting, such corrections could be generated,
if b4(X) (cid:54)= 0, by supersymmetric D3-brane instantons. However, as it can be explicitly
checked from the complete quadratic fermionic eﬀective action derived [17], even if super-
symmetric D3-brane instantons existed, they would always carry at least four fermionic
zero-modes. This indicates that a non-trivial superpotential is never generated.

The HEFT (3.6) breaks down when two or more D3-branes coincide.

Indeed, in
this limit the above moduli do not describe the comple light spectrum of the string
background, which must include an non-abelian N = 4 SYM sector. Such break-down
is invisible at the level of the our second-derivative HEFT. This is consistent with the
non-renormalisation theorem for N = 4 super-Yang-Mills, which well approximates the
D3-brane sector of the HEFT when they are very close.
In any case, at such points
the internal geometry has no pathologies and just develops some larger local AdS5 × S5
throat, which is an exact string theory background [16] and is holographically dual to
the additional N = 4 SYM sector.

3.3 Structure of the moduli space
In this section we discuss in some more detail the structure of the moduli space MSUGRA
of our models, which provides the target space of the non-linear sigma model deﬁning
our HEFT.

The D3-brane positions zi

I parametrise the space
MD3 = SymN X ,

(3.16)
while the chiral moduli βα parametrise a 2b4(X)-dimensional torus Mβ. The additional
b2(X) chiral coordinates ρa (or rather e2πρa) parametrise the ﬁbres of non-trivial line
bundles over MD3 × Mβ. Hence, MSUGRA can be locally identiﬁed with the total space
of the direct sum of such line bundles. This is most easily seen from the K¨ahler metric
on the moduli space, which can be read from the HEFT (3.6):

(3.18)
In order to better understand the global structure of MSUGRA, it is convenient to
parametrise it in a diﬀerent way. We ﬁrst isolate the angular variables φa ≡ Imρa and
cα ≡ Reβα, which we collectively denote by ϕI. They parametrise a b2(X) + b4(X) =
χ(X)−1 dimensional torus U (1)χ−1 describing the R-R ﬂat potentials.9 Together with the
I, the angles ϕI parametrise a space M0. Since the angular variables
D3 brane positions zi
φa are ﬁbered over MD3, M0 can be regarded as a ﬁbration of the torus U (1)χ−1 over
MD3.
Then, we substitute Reρa and Imβα with the coordinates ζI ≡ (va, χα), deﬁned by a

an overall rescaling va → λva, with λ > 0, we also have χα → λχα. Hence ζI = (va, χα)

are aﬀected by subtle K-theory corrections [10], see footnote 2.

parametrise a b2(X) + b4(X) dimensional cone K.10 Actually, the complete moduli space
is given by the extension of K to a larger cone, for instance by connecting diﬀerent
K¨ahler cones by ﬂop transitions. The internal space X is not generically invariant under
such transitions and then the supergravity description generically breaks down at the
transition walls.

We arrive at following global description of the supergravity moduli space MSUGRA:

Clearly, such global structure is obscured by the use of the chiral coordinates (ρa, βα, zi

We can also express such metric in terms of the potential obtained by Legendre

F must be considered as a function of (ζI, zi

In particular, Imβα must be
considered as functions of (va, χα), whose explicit form can be obtained by inverting
(3.20). By using the collective coordinates ζI = (va, χα) and ϕI = (φa, cα) the metric

which shows that the coordinates ζI can be regarded as symplectically paired with the
angles ϕI and that F can be interpreted as a mixed complex-symplectic potential.11

We then obtain two possible descriptions of the geometry of MSUGRA. A mixed
complex-symplectic one and a purely complex one. On the one hand, the complex-
symplectic one appears more ‘natural’ since it better exhibits the global structure (3.21)
of the moduli space, the potential F is not implicitly deﬁned as the K¨ahler potential
K and may even more easily accommodate world-sheet quantum corrections.
In this
sense, one may regard F as the fundamental quantity and derive K as its anti-Legendre
transform. On the other hand, as we discuss in the next section, the chiral coordinates
of the complex formulation can be directly related to the vev of the chiral operators of
the dual CFT. Furthermore, they naturally couple to D-brane instantons and then they
appear more suitable to describe the complete quantum corrected geometry of the moduli
space.

4 CFT moduli space

In this section we compare the description of the supergravity moduli space provided by
the HEFT with the expectations for the moduli space of the dual CFT.

11The above Legendre transform can be interpreted as a duality transformation between chiral and
linear multiplets [18]. Indeed, the function F gives the HEFT in terms of linear multiplets. The linear
multiplets are described by real superﬁelds LI, such that ¯D2LI = D2LI = 0. Each LI contains the
scalar ﬁeld ζI, as lowest component, and a three-form ﬁeld-strength HI which is dual to dϕI. The

HEFT Lagrangian can then be deﬁned as superspace integral(cid:82) d4θF (L, z, ¯z). If b4(X) = 0, its bosonic

terms are as in (A.20), up to replacing the indices A, B with a, b.

18

4.1 Quiver gauge theories

In all the known cases, the CFT corresponds to the IR ﬁxed point of a gauge theory
describing N D3 branes probing the Calabi-Yau singularity C(Y ). This is given by an
N = 1 quiver gauge theory with gauge group

g(cid:89)

G =

SU (N )i ,

(4.1)

i=1

chiral ﬁelds Φa transforming in the bi-fundamental representation of pairs of SU (N )
factors and a certain superpotential W (Φ). 12 The number g of SU (N ) factors correspond
to the Euler characteristic of the resolved space X:

g ≡ χ(X) = 1 + b2(X) + b4(X) .

(4.2)

The theory admit marginal deformations that are parametrised by the gauge and superpo-
tential couplings. Only a part of these couplings are marginal parameters. Geometrically,
we always have at least 1 + b2(Y ) marginal parameters that correspond to the parameters
τ , λσ of the dual string background. Some CFTs have additional marginal deformations,
for example the so-called β-deformation [19], corresponding to string backgrounds where
the internal metric is no more a warped Calabi-Yau.

The moduli space is given by the solutions of the F and D term conditions

∂W
∂Φa

= 0 ,

Dsu(N )i(Φa) = 0 ,

(4.3)
up to gauge equivalence, where Dsu(N )i, i = 1,··· , g, is the moment map for the action of
the group SU (N )i. The D-term condition can be omitted if we mod by the complexiﬁed
gauge group GC. As an aﬃne variety, the moduli space can be indeed written as the
quotient of the manifold of F-term solutions by the complexiﬁed gauge group

(4.4)

By deﬁnition, the coordinate ring of this aﬃne variety is just the set of gauge invariant
chiral operators made with the Φa. The gauge invariant chiral operators are then in one-
to-one correspondence with the holomorphic functions on the moduli space and provide
a complete characterisation of the moduli space as an aﬃne complex variety.

In the toric case, there is an explicit algorithm to write the quiver gauge theory from

the toric data which is discussed in details in [20, 21].

12We consider adjoint ﬁelds as particular cases of bi-fundamentals connecting the same gauge group.

19

4.2 The global symmetries

Of particular importance for us are the global symmetries of the CFT. There are few
general observations that can be made for any quiver. The CFT is the IR limit of the
theory of N D3 branes and, in this limit, eventual abelian gauge groups decouple. Indeed,
the gauge group

(cid:32) g(cid:89)

(cid:33)

˜G =

U (N )i

/U (1) .

(4.5)

i=1

on a set of N D3-branes probing the singularity contains various abelian factors. The N
D3-branes decompose into g = 1 + b2(X) + b4(X) stacks of fractional D3-branes, each
supporting a U (N )i gauge group, and the bifundamental ﬁelds correspond to the massless
states of open strings connecting diﬀerent fractional branes. The diagonal U (1) is always
decoupled and can be modded out as in (4.5).

One is then left with b2(X) + b4(X) U (1) gauge factors in ˜G, only b3(Y ) of which are
non-anomalous. The anomaly of the remaining b2(X) + b4(X)− b3(Y ) = 2b4(X) U (1)’s is
cancelled by a St¨uckelberg mechanism. This can be understood geometrically as follows.
One may roughly interpret b2(X) + b4(X) fractional D-branes as combinations of D5 and
D7 branes wrapping two- and four-cycles of the resolved geometry. The corresponding
U (1)’s gauge R-R axions associated with the Poincar´e dual cohomologies H 4(X, Y ; R) and
H 2(X, Y ; R). However, as we have discussed in section 2.3, while all b4(X) independent
elements of H 2(X, Y ; R) admit an L2-normalisable harmonic representative, only a b4(X)-
dimensional subspace of H 4(X, Y ; R). Prior to the near-horizon limit, only these 2b4(X)
L2-normalisable modes remain dynamical in the four-dimensional eﬀective theory, and
they are exactly the right number to cancel the corresponding gauge anomalies `a la
St¨uckelberg. The remaining b3(Y ) axions, which would be gauged by the non-anomalous
U (1)’s, have inﬁnite kinetic terms and hence decouple in the four-dimensional low-energy
theory.

on C(Y ) are mutually BPS and we can put them in arbitrary position. This implies that
the mesonic moduli space is given, as an algebraic variety, by

Mmes = SymN C(Y )

(4.8)

and it has dimension 3N . It can be parametrised by the D3-brane positions on Y .

The resolution parameters of the Calabi-Yau X enter as FI parameters ξi for the D3-
brane theory (4.5). The moduli space of D3-branes probing X is given by the solutions
of

i ξi = 0. The moduli space is now SymN X and it can be
I on X that are away from the blown-up

locus.

In the IR limit all abelian factors in the D3-brane theory decouple and become global
symmetries of the CFT. More precisely, the b3(Y ) non-anomalous U (1) factors decouple
at low energy, being IR free, while the other 2b4(X) U (1) factors become massive by
the St¨uckelberg mechanism. Hence, at low energy, one is left with the gauge group (4.1)
and b3(Y ) non-anomalous plus 2b4(Y ) anomalous global U (1) symmetries. Such U (1)
classical global symmetries are called baryonic. Simultaneously, the trace part of the
D-ﬂatness condition in (4.7) gets relaxed. One is then left with Dsu(N )i(Φ) = 0, which
can be written as

Du(N )i(Φ) = Vi1N×N ,

Vi =

The operator Vi is the lowest component of the vector multiplet containing the abelian
current corresponding the i-th gauge group. Notice that Vi is not part of a chiral multi-
plet, but it is nevertheless protected when the associated baryonic U (1) symmetry is not
anomalous.

After the near-horizon limit, the above FI parameters ξi can be identiﬁed with the

expectation values of Vi,

ξi = (cid:104)Vi(cid:105) .

we may refer to them as FI moduli. Since they still satisfy(cid:80)

Now the ξi can be regarded as part of the moduli space and, with some abuse of language,
i ξi = 0, they parametrise
g − 1 real directions in moduli space. They naturally pair with the g − 1 Goldstone

bosons associated with the baryonic symmetries. Indeed, in a generic point of the moduli
space, the bi-fundamental ﬁelds Φa have a vev and the abelian global symmetries are
spontaneously broken. More precisely, the b3(Y ) non-anomalous U (1) symmetries are
associated with Goldstone bosons, while the anomalous ones are associated with pseudo-
Goldstone bosons.

We then see that the total moduli space M has complex dimension

dimM = 3N + g − 1 .

(4.13)
Indeed M can be obtained from (4.8), by relaxing the trace of the D-ﬂatness constraints
and by omitting the corresponding U (1) gauge identiﬁcations. This gives us the g − 1
extra complex moduli associated with a complex combination of the FI moduli and the
Goldstone bosons. Holographically, they correspond to the metric, B2, C2 and C4 moduli
of the dual resolved Calabi-Yau, which are dynamical in the near-horizon geometry.
By comparing with Section 3, we can make the identiﬁcation M (cid:39) MSUGRA and set

the correspondence with the string theory moduli given in Table 2.

As we noticed in Section 3, we can use complex as well as complex-symplectic co-
ordinates to describe the moduli space. The HEFT chiral ﬁelds ρa, βα, zi
I provide a
holographic complex parameterisation of the CFT moduli space M. The vev of a gauge
invariant chiral operator is a holomorphic function on M and therefore should be express-
ible as a holomorphic function of ρa, βα, zi
I. On the other hand, one may use the alterna-
tive complex-symplectic coordinates ζI, ϕI, zi
I parametrise the motion
of the D3-branes on the resolved cone X. The angles ϕI = (φa, cα), I = 1, . . . , g − 1,
correspond to the baryonic Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone (real) bosons, while the
symplectic coordinates ζI = (va, χα) can be set in correspondence with FI moduli ξi

At the generic point of the moduli space, the CFT microscopic gauge theory group is
spontaneously broken to N − 1 decoupled U (1) factors, plus the overall diagonal U (1) of
the parent quiver U (N ) theory which, being always decoupled, is usually ignored. Then,
at low energy, there is a total of N trivial and fully decoupled SYM U (1) sectors, which
are represented by the contribution (3.7) to the HEFT.

4.3 Comparison with the AdS/CFT correspondence

In the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, smooth backgrounds with the same bound-
ary asymptotics describe diﬀerent vacua of the same theory. In our case, AdS5 × Y itself
corresponds to the origin of the moduli space M. All other vacua in M are associated
with smooth backgrounds asymptotic to AdS5×Y . As we have discussed, they correspond
to the near horizon geometries of D3-branes moving on the resolved Calabi-Yau.

The non-anomalous baryonic symmetries are easy to identify in terms of the geometry
of Y . They are associated with the massless vectors in the bulk that arise from the
reduction of C4 on Y . There are precisely b3(Y ) of them.
In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the natural objects to consider are the gauge invari-
ant operators. The corresponding bulk ﬁelds arise from the KK spectrum of AdS5 × Y
and from wrapped branes. The chiral KK modes on Y are in one-to-one correspondence
with the mesonic operators with zero baryonic charge. On the other hand, baryonic op-
erators are obtained by wrapping Euclidean D3-branes on non trivial three-cycles Σ ⊂ Y .
A Euclidean D3-brane is supersymmetric when the complex cone C(Σ) is a divisor in
the Calabi-Yau cone C(Y ). The more general classical supersymmetric D3-brane conﬁg-
uration is obtained by considering arbitrary divisors and it is expected that all baryonic
operators in the CFT arise by a geometric quantisation of these classical conﬁgurations
[22, 23]. We can consider also divisors that are trivial and correspond to contractible
three-cycles in Y . The interpretation of the corresponding state is in terms of giant
gravitons [23].

This point of view is particularly useful because every elementary ﬁeld Φ in the quiver
transform in the bi-fundamental or adjoint representation of the gauge group G and
therefore, by a double determinant, we can always construct a gauge invariant operator,
schematically denoted by det Φ. There should exist therefore a conical divisor D in C(Y )
corresponding to the ﬁeld Φ. A D3-brane wrapped on the base of D corresponds to the
operator det Φ. When the base of D in Y is non-trivial, this is a baryonic operator.
When the base is trivial, the operator is equivalent to a complicated linear combination
of mesonic operators.14 This identiﬁcation allows to compute the dimension of a baryonic
operator B associated with a divisor D using purely geometrical data as [24]

N πvol(Σ)
2vol(Y )

,

(4.14)

where Σ ⊂ Y is the base of D.
14The standard example is AdS5 × S5 where all the three-cycles are trivial. The determinant
tions of product of traces, det Φ = (cid:80)
of any elementary adjoint ﬁelds Φ in N = 4 SYM can be written in terms of a linear combina-
n1+...+np=N cn1···np TrΦn1 ··· TrΦnp , using the tensor identity

a1···aN b1···bN = N !δa1

[b1 ··· δaN
bN ].

23

We then expect, in general, a correspondence between elementary ﬁelds and conical
divisors in C(Y ). This correspondence is well understood for toric Calabi-Yau cones
[20, 25, 26, 27, 21, 28].
It allows to reconstruct the quiver gauge theory form toric
data and to compute dimension and R-charges of the elementary ﬁelds in the CFT from
geometry.

More interestingly for us, we can also probe the vev of the baryonic operator as-
sociated with a divisor D by evaluating the Euclidean action of a D3-brane wrapping
the corresponding divisor in the resolved space X [4]. This can be re-interpreted in the
language of our HEFT, as it will be discussed in details in the next Section.

5 Baryonic vevs from Euclidean D3-branes

In the unbroken phase, the chiral baryonic operators are associated with supersymmetric
Euclidean D3-branes (E3-branes) wrapping non-compact divisors of the Calabi-Yau cone
C(Y ) [22, 23]. This correspondence is assumed to remain true even in the baryonic phase,
in which the FI moduli ξi are non-vanishing and the internal space X is correspondingly
resolved into a smooth space.15
In particular, a natural subclass of baryons is associ-
ated with asymptotically conical eﬀective divisors. Hence, according to the prescription
adopted in [4] for the KW theory, the vev of the baryonic operator B with dimension ∆B
associated with an asymptotically conical non-compact divisor D can be extracted from
the schematic semiclassical formula

e−SE3 (cid:39) r−∆B

c

(cid:104)B(cid:105) ,

(5.1)

where rc represents an UV cut-oﬀ that regularises the on-shell action SE3.
The extension of this procedure to more general theories has been discussed in some
detail in [8, 5]. In this section we would like to compute (cid:104)B(cid:105) in terms of our supergravity
chiral ﬁelds ρa, βα, zi
I. We then need to compute SE3 associated with a supersymmet-
ric E3-brane wrapping D and supporting a line-bundle with ﬁxed boundary condition
speciﬁed as follows.

We denote by Σ = ∂D the asymptotic boundary of D and as in [5] we assume that
b1(Σ) = 0, H1(D; Z) = 0 and H 2(D; C) ≡ H 1,1(D; C), which indeed hold for most of the
known explicit examples (e.g. in the toric cases). We then have H1(Σ; Z) ≡ H1(Σ; Z)tor
and we can write the short exact sequence

0 −→ H2(D; Z) −→ H2(D, Σ; Z) −→ H1(Σ; Z)tor −→ 0 .

(5.2)

15This correspondence is valid only at the semiclassical level. More precisely, a baryon is associated
with a state of the Hilbert space which is obtained by quantising the moduli space of the divisor [23].
See later for further discussions on this point.

24

Now, a line bundle L on D is associated with a certain element of H 2(D; Z) by its ﬁrst
Chern class. By Poincar´e duality, we can regard it as a relative two-cycle in H2(D, Σ; Z),
which can have a torsional one-cycle γ ⊂ Σ as boundary. Hence, ﬁxing the boundary
condition for the allowed line bundle L corresponds to ﬁxing such torsional one-cycle
γ ⊂ Σ, which in turn corresponds to ﬁxing the torsional line bundle L|Σ on the boundary
Σ. On the other hand from (5.2) it is clear that there are diﬀerent line bundles with
the same ﬁxed boundary condition. They are counted by the two-cycles in H2(D; Z),
which are Poincar´e dual to compactly supported world-volume ﬂuxes in H 2(D, Σ; Z).
Therefore, on the r.h.s of (5.1) one should actually sum over all line bundles on D which
deﬁne the same ﬂat torsional line bundle on the boundary Σ.

Let us denote by F the world-volume ﬂux associated with the line bundle L plus the
possibile half-integer shift due to the Freed-Witten anomaly, so that 1
2π [F ] = c1(L) +

2c1(D) [29, 30]. This then naturally combines with the B2 ﬁeld into the gauge invariant

(5.3)

A detailed discussion of the supersymmetry of Euclidean D-branes in N = 1 backgrounds
can be found in [31], and the resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the
generalised calibrations of [32, 33]. In our setting, they traslate into the condition that
the E3-brane warps a holomorphic submanifold, as we are assuming, and that F is anti-
self-dual:

(5.4)
In [5] it is argued that, under our topological assumptions, H 2(D, Σ; R) (cid:39) H 2(D; R) (cid:39)
H2
L2(D), so that any element of H 2(D; R) admits an harmonic representative, which is
L2-normalisable with the respect to the metric induced on D.
In particular, we can
choose a basis of L2-normalisable harmonic (1, 1)-forms αk, k = 1, . . . , b2(D), and a basis

of two-cycles C k ⊂ D in H2(D; Z) such that(cid:82)

by following the same argument used for the bulk (1,1)-forms ωa, one can show that also the (1,1)-
forms αk on D are primitive and then anti-self-dual. We then observe that, as in [5], one can write
D αk ∧ αl = [αk]cpt ∪ [αl], where [αk]cpt is a representative of αk in H 2(D, Σ; R). On the other hand,
from the short exact sequence Poincar´e dual to (5.2) we see that, since [αk] ∈ H 2(D; Z) and H 2(Σ; Z)tor
can be non-trivial, [αk]cpt does not necessarily deﬁne an element of H 2(D, Σ; Z). Rather, we can always
choose a minimal nk ∈ Z such that [nkαk]cpt ∈ H 2(D, Σ; Z) (cid:39) H2(D; Z). Hence, in general the entries
of Ikl are just rational.

and parameters.

Let us start with the second term on the r.h.s. of (5.9). By expanding [D] = na[Da] in

We can now pass to the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (5.9). As in [7] (see also [36] for

as follows:

e−4AJ ∧ J ∧ δ2(D) =

We can then use the identity δ2(D) = 1
section of O(D) deﬁning the divisor D = {ζD(z) = 0}, which implies that

2π i∂ ¯∂ log |ζD(z)|2, where ζD(z) is a non-trivial

J(cid:121)δ2(D) = − 1
4π

∆ log |ζD|2 .

(5.15)
In order to make this formula useful notice that, since the harmonic (1,1) form ωD ≡ naωa
is primitive, the associated locally deﬁned potential κD ≡ naκa (such that ωD = i∂ ¯∂κD)
is harmonic: ∆κD = 0. Then we can actually write

where

∆hD ,

J(cid:121)δ2(D) = − 1
4π

hD(x) ≡ log(cid:0)|ζD|2e−2πκD(cid:1) (x) .

(5.16)

(5.17)

This function is nothing but the norm of the holomorphic section ζD and (5.16) tells us
that we can regard hD as a harmonic function on X\D which is ‘sourced’ by the divisor
D.

The advantage of modifying (5.15) in this way is that hD is globally deﬁned, while
log |ζD|2 is only locally deﬁned. Then, we can substitute it in (5.14) and integrate by
parts twice, getting

and rc is a very large UV regulator, which will be eventually sent to ∞. We have implicitly
used the asymptotic warping (2.5) and the fact that the ﬁve-dimensional manifold deﬁned
by {r = rc} coincides with the Sasaki-Einstein manifold Y in the rc → ∞ limit.
In order to compute the behaviour of IΣ(rc) for rc → ∞, we just need the behaviour
of hD(x) at the boundary r (cid:39) rc. In this region the metric is well approximated by the
conical one (2.2). One can then use the expansion hD(x) = hλ
D(r)αλ(y) in an orthogonal
basis αλ of eigenfunctions of the Sasaki-Einstein Laplace operator on Y such that ∆Y αλ =
λαλ, with λ ≥ 0. In particular, we can choose α0(y) ≡ 1 as zero-mode. Clearly, only
such zero-mode contributes to (5.19), which, using also (2.6), becomes

We conclude that 2πIΣ(rc) provides the only (logarithmically) divergent contribution
E3 . By comparing (5.25) with (5.1), we arrive at the identiﬁcation

to SDBI

(5.26)
which is indeed the expected dimension of the baryon B, see (4.14). Hence, as already
argued in [8], the DBI action has the correct divergent contribution to match (5.1).

The complete E3 on-shell action is given SE3 = SDBI

We see that, up to a constant, (cid:104)B(cid:105) is completely determined by the chiral ﬁelds
entering the HEFT in a manifestly holomorphic way, which is indeed one of its expected
properties. The appearance of a theta function depending on the B2 and C2 moduli in
this type of evaluation of the baryonic vev was already pointed out in [5] and is expected
from the general discussion of [37] for the dual ﬁve-brane. Here we have made manifest
its compatibility with structure of our HEFT. The proper understanding of the global
properties of this holomorphic dependence would require a better study of the K-theory
corrections to the R-R periodicities, see footnote 2, which will not be addressed in the
present paper.

We remark that (5.31) gives just a semiclassical formula for the baryonic condensates.
In fact, in order to obtain a more precise identiﬁcation of the corresponding baryonic
operators, one must quantise the E3-brane moduli space, as in [23]. This means that
one must consider (cid:104)B(cid:105) in (5.31) as a section of an appropriate line bundle LB over the
moduli space of the divisor D. This holomorphic section must be considered as a wave-
function in the Hilbert space of BPS E3-branes, which can be expanded in a basis of
global sections of LB, corresponding to a basis of baryonic operators. The coeﬃcients of
this expansion can be then identiﬁed with the vev of the corresponding operators. See
Section 6.4 for an explicit illustration of this procedure for the Klebanov-Witten model.

6 The HEFT of the Klebanov-Witten theory

In this section we focus on the KW model [2], presenting a detailed discussion of its
HEFT. This will illustrate how to concretely apply our general results in a prototypical
example. It would be interesting to extend this analysis to other models, in particular to
understand some aspects, like the anomalous U (1) symmetries, which are not present in
the KW model.

6.1 CFT of the KW model

Let us start by brieﬂy reviewing the structure of the CFT of the KW model and its
moduli space from a ﬁeld theoretical perspective.

The ﬁeld theory describe N D3-branes probing the singular conifold [38]. The gauge
group is SU (N ) × SU (N ), there are four bi-fundamentals ﬁelds Ai and Bp, i, p = 1, 2,
transforming in the representation (N, ¯N ) and ( ¯N , N ) of the gauge group, respectively,
and the superpotential is

W = h ijpq Tr(AiBpAjBq) .

(6.1)

The theory has two SU (2) global symmetries transforming the Ai and Bp independently
as doublets. There is, in addition, a non-anomalous baryonic symmetry transforming the
ﬁelds Ai with charge +1 and the ﬁelds Bp with charge −1.

The classical moduli space is obtained by imposing the conditions (4.3), which in the

present case read

2 − B
†
†
1 + A2A

pqBpAiBq = ijAiBpAj = 0 ,

2) .

(6.2a)

(6.2b)

(6.3)

This operator is non chiral but it is contained in the same multiplet of the current that
generates the baryonic symmetry. Hence its dimension is protected and equal to its
classical value, ∆V = 2. The expectation value of V determines the arbitrary parameter

(6.4)
which is formally equivalent to a FI for the U (N ) × U (N ) theory. As in Section 4, we
will refer to ξ as a FI modulus.

ξ = (cid:104)V(cid:105) ,

Let us ﬁrst discuss the mesonic moduli space (4.7), which is obtained by setting ξ=0.
This is the subvariety of the moduli space which can be detected by purely mesonic
operators

TrAi1Bp1 ··· AinBpn ,

(6.5)
with zero baryonic charge. They are fully symmetric in the indices i1,··· , in and p1,··· , pn
by the F-ﬂatness relations (6.2a). The mesonic operators can be constructed by using as
building blocks the four N by N matrices

ΦU = A1B1 ,

ΦV = A2B2 ,

ΦX = A2B1 ,

ΦY = A1B2 ,

(6.6)

31

which transform in the adjoint representation of the ﬁrst group U (N ) and then have zero
baryonic charge. Using the F-ﬂatness relations (6.2a), one can easily check that they
commute and satisfy the algebraic equation of the conifold as an algebraic variety

ΦU ΦV = ΦXΦY .

(6.7)

Since ΦU , ΦV , ΦX, ΦY commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalised. The corre-
sponding N eigenvalues take values in the space deﬁned by the coordinates (U, V, X, Y ) ∈
C4 satisfying the equation

U V = XY .

(6.8)

This equation deﬁnes the singular conifold. We see that the mesonic moduli space is
the symmetric product of N copies of the singular conifold and it has dimension 3N , in
agreement with (4.8).

On the other hand, according to equation (4.13), the full moduli space has dimension
3N +1, which is parametrised not only by the mesonic operators (6.5) but also by baryonic
ones. Since the ﬁelds transform in the bi-fundamental representation, we can construct
gauge-invariant baryonic operators, the prototype being

generalised the above operators, by replacing each single entry in the epsilon contraction
with a more general composite ﬁeld with the same transformation properties under the
gauge group, for example

(Ai)b1
a1

→

(Ai1Bp1 ··· AikBpkAi)b1
a1 ,

(6.10)

and similarly for (Bp)b1
a1. This gives a pletora of baryonic operators which are obtained by
dressing the elementary baryons (6.9) with mesonic excitations. Mesonic and baryonic
operators are not all independent and satisfy many relations. 18 The set of generators
of the algebra of chiral operators and the Hilbert series of the moduli space have been
investigated in [41, 42, 26].

18Since ΦU , ΦV , ΦX and ΦY in (6.6) are N by N matrices, mesons consisting of more than N such
building blocks can be written in terms of smaller mesons (see for example [39, 40] for a general discus-
sion). Moreover, using the tensor identity a1···aN b1···bN = N !δa1
bN ], we can transform particular
products of baryons into mesons, for example, schematically
U + ···

0 ∼ Tr ΦN

[b1 ··· δaN

(6.11)

We can only do this because the operator on the left hand side has zero baryonic charge.

32

The baryonic operators can see directions in the moduli space which are invisible
to the mesonic operators, ‘resolving’ the conifold singularity of mesonic moduli space.
To have an idea of how this happens, consider the vacua where the vev of any mesonic
operator vanishes. This requires that either Ai or Bp are zero. Consider for example the
case where all Bp = 0. The F-ﬂatness conditions (6.2a) are automatically satisﬁed. The
D-ﬂatness conditions (6.2b) give
†
†
†
†
1A1 + A
2 = A
1 + A2A

(6.12)

A1A

and necessarily ξ > 0. We see that, by modding by the gauge transformation, these equa-
tions imply that the N eigenvalues of the operators A1, A2 describe N points moving on
a P1. The P1 is the exceptional cycle that resolves the conifold singularity. Correspond-
ingly, the vevs of the N + 1 baryonic operators BA
n are generically non-vanishing. These
parametrise the N points moving on the P1 together with an additional complex modulus
which combines the FI modulus and the Goldstone boson associated with the sponta-
neously broken baryonic U (1). As we will see in the following subsections, all these CFT
aspects have a clear holographic counterpart.

6.2 The dual background

The generic vacuum of the KW theory is holographically dual to a IIB solution of the kind
described in Section 2.1, with the resolved conifold as internal space X. The boundary
is then given by the Sasaki-Einstein space Y = T 1,1. X has a complex structure which
is most easily described by using toric homogenous coordinates (Z 1, Z 2, Z 3, Z 4) ∈ C4,
which must be identiﬁed under a U (1) action with charge vector Q = (1, 1,−1,−1) and
must satisfy the D-ﬂatness condition

|Z 1|2 + |Z 2|2 − |Z 3|3 − |Z 4|2 = ξ .

(6.13)

For ξ = 0 one gets the singular conifold, while there are two possible resolutions associated
with ξ > 0 or ξ < 0 respectively, which are related by a ﬂop transition. By comparing
this description with the dual CFT, we see that the complex coordinates (Z 1, Z 2, Z 3, Z 4)
are naturally associated with the elementary chiral operators A1, A2, B1, B2 in the chosen
order. So, as the notation suggest, ξ can be identiﬁed with the FI modulus of the dual
CFT deﬁned in (6.4). In the following we will assume ξ > 0. As a complex space, this
resolved conifold X can be represented as

X (cid:39) C4 − {Z 1 = Z 2 = 0}

,

(6.14)
where C∗ (cid:39) U (1)C acts as follows: (Z 1, Z 2, Z 3, Z 4) (cid:55)→ (αZ 1, αZ 2, α−1Z 3, α−1Z 4) for
α ∈ C∗.

C∗

33

The resolved conifold space X has Betti numbers b2(X) = b3(Y ) = 1 and b4(X) = 0.
In particular, H2(X; Z) is generated by the two-sphere P1 deﬁned by Z 3 = Z 4 = 0. In
fact, as a complex space, X can be alternatively identiﬁed with the total space of the
bundle

OP1(−1) ⊕ OP1(−1) .

(6.15)

On the other hand, in the above toric description the space X inherits also a K¨ahler
structure from the ambient ﬂat metric on C4. This does not coincides with the Ricci-ﬂat
K¨ahler form J on X, but lies in the same cohomology class. This allows to compute

(cid:90)

P1

J = ξ ,

(6.16)

which shows how ξ measures the size of the resolution P1.

We can identify four toric divisors DA = {Z A = 0}. Notice that D1 (cid:39) D2 (cid:39) C2
and D3 (cid:39) D4 (cid:39) OP1(−1). In other words D1 and D2 can be identiﬁed with the ﬁber of
(6.15), while D3 and D4 are obtained by setting to zero one of the two line coordinates
in OP1(−1). Furthermore, these toric divisors deﬁne relative homology classes [DA] ∈
H4(X, Y ; Z) which are identiﬁed as follows [D1] = [D2] = −[D3] = −[D4]. 19

Let us introduce the harmonic form ω which is Poincar´e dual to, say, D1 (or D2).
Then, according to our general discussion – see equation (2.21) – we can decompose the
K¨ahler form on X as follows

where J0 is an exact two-form. Since(cid:82)

J = J0 + v ω ,
(6.17)
P1 ω = P1 · D1 = 1, from (6.16) we see that we can

in fact identify the FI parameter ξ with the (unique) K¨ahler modulus v:

v ≡ ξ .

(6.18)

Hence, in particular, we have

(cid:104)V(cid:105) = v .

(6.19)
The moduli space (3.21) for the KW background has the following structure. M0 is
a U (1) ﬁbration over MD3 = SymN X, with ﬁbral angular variable φ and local complex
I along MD3. The cone K coincides with the one-dimensional K¨ahler cone
coordinates zi
R+ parametrised by v.20 The coordinates (v, φ) are symplectically paired and are Leg-
endre dual to a single chiral coordinate ρ, as described in general in Section 3.3. Hence,
the HEFT will be described by a total of 1 + 3N chiral ﬁelds ρ, zi
I.

19As usual, the homological relations between toric divisors can be reﬁned into linear equivalences, see
e.g. [43]. For instance, D1 + D3 is represented by the zero-locus of Z 1Z 3, which deﬁnes a holomorphic
function on X. Hence D1 and D3 are linearly equivalent, the divisor D1 + D3 corresponds to a trivial
line bundle and is then homologically trivial.
case, the extended K is divided in two chambers, connected by a ﬂop transition.

20This can be extended to the entire real line by adding the other possible small resolution. In this

34

In order to compute the HEFT of the KW model we need the explicit form of J in
complex coordinates. This can be described by identifying X with (6.15) and using two
local patches U± as follows. First introduce two local patches of the base P1, parametrised
by two local coordinates χ and χ(cid:48), such that χ(cid:48) = 1/χ, so that χ = 0 can be identiﬁed
with the North pole and χ(cid:48) = 0 with the South pole. The local patches U± on X are
then provided by the restriction of the ﬁbration (6.15) to these patches on the base P1.
In particular, (χ, U, Y ) and (χ(cid:48), X, V ) denote the coordinates on U+ and U− respectively,
where (U, Y ) and (X, V ) are ﬁbral coordinates along the vector bundle (6.15), related by
X = χU and V = χY .21 They satisfy the constrain XY − U V = 0 and then parametrise
the singular conifold. By expressing (U, V, X, Y ) in terms of the homogeneous coordinates
– see footnote 21 – it is clear that their values at position of the N D3-branes correspond
to the eigenvalues of the mesonic operators (6.6).

We now introduce the radial coordinate

s =(cid:112)(1 + |χ|2)(|U|2 + |Y |2) =(cid:112)(1 + |χ(cid:48)|2)(|X|2 + |V |2) .

(6.20)
The resolved P1 then sits at zero radius s = 0. The K¨ahler form J is speciﬁed by the
(locally deﬁned) K¨ahler potential k(z, ¯z; v), such that J = i∂ ¯∂k. In the patch U+, it is
given by [38, 44]

k(z, ¯z; v) =

(6.21)
and by replacing χ with χ(cid:48) one gets the K¨ahler potential k on U−. The function G(x; v)

(6.25)

More in detail, by integrating ω = i∂ ¯∂κ one gets κ(z, ¯z; v) up to a v-dependent piece.
This can be ﬁxed by requiring the boundary condition (2.35), which uses the conical
radial coordinate r, introduced in (6.28) below. This ﬁxes the form (6.25) for κ(z, ¯z; v).
On U−, κ takes the same form (6.25), up to replacing χ with χ(cid:48).

We can also compute the potential k0 deﬁned as in (2.28) and satisfying (2.32). This

is given by

k0(z, ¯z; v) =

(6.26)

We note that k0 is globally deﬁned on X, accordingly with our general discussion.

It is also useful to recall how to write the metric and K¨ahler form in real conical

coordinates. These are given by ﬁve angular coordinates (ψ, φ1, θ1, φ2, θ2) deﬁned by

λ which sets the (non-dynamical) value of the two-form potentials: C2 − τ B2 = (cid:96)2

6.3 The HEFT

We are now ready to derive the HEFT. We have already said that in addition to the
I = (χI, UI, YI) (in the patch U+) describing the positions of the
3N chiral moduli zi
D3-branes, there is just one chiral modulus ρ.

It is interesting to observe that, as far as the D3-branes are all away from the blown-
I (cid:54)= 0 for all I), the Lagrangian (6.35) remains regular in the limit v (cid:28) 1,
up P1 (i.e. s2

Coming back to the complete HEFT, in addition to being manifestly N = 1 supersym-
metric, it should also be invariant under a non-linear realisation of the superconformal
generators that are spontaneously broken by the vacua at which the HEFT is deﬁned.
Let us explicitly check it for the dilations.

In order to do that, we must identify the scaling dimensions of the ﬁelds entering
the HEFT. This is particularly easy in the KW model since, as discussed above, the
CFT chiral ﬁelds A1, A2, B1, B2 are in natural correspondence with the homogeneous
coordinates Z A. The dimension of the ﬁelds A1, A2, B1, B2 in the CFT is uniquely ﬁxed
to be 3/4 by the SU (2) × SU (2) symmetry and the fact that the quartic superpotential
must have dimension 3. Hence we can assign to Z A a scaling dimension ∆Z = 3
4 and this
= 0 and ∆UI = ∆VI = ∆XI = ∆YI = 3
in turn implies the scaling dimensions ∆χI = ∆χ(cid:48)
2
(see footnote 21), and then also ∆s2
= 3. The scaling dimension of ρ can be determined
by relating it to the the expectation value of the baryonic operators, as we will see in the
next subsection. The result will imply that e−2πρ has scaling dimension 3N
4 . Furthermore,
the real K¨ahler modulus v has scaling dimension ∆v = 2, as one can immediately conclude
from (6.19).23

2, which implies that the supersymmetric Lagrangian(cid:82) d4θK is indeed scale invariant,

It is now easy to explicitly check that the K¨ahler potential (6.33) has scaling dimension

as required.

23By using (6.34) one can check that this is consistent with the scaling dimension 3N

4 of e−2πρ.

6.4 Baryonic condensates

So far, we have only partially provided a CFT interpretation of the supergravity chiral
ﬁelds ρ, zi
I. In particular, we have identiﬁed the HEFT chiral ﬁelds UI, VI, XI, YI with
the N eigenvalues of the mesonic operators (6.6). On the other hand, the expectation
value of a general mesonic operator cannot ‘see’ neither ρ nor the position of D3-branes
sitting at diﬀerent points of the resolution P1.

This additional information is in fact encoded in the vev of the baryonic operators
which, according to the prescription [4] reviewed in Section 5, can be computed by
evaluating the on-shell action of E3-branes on non-compact divisors in X. More precisely,
the diﬀerent baryons with given dimension and charge are associated with diﬀerent states
in the Hilbert space which is obtained by quantising the moduli space of the associated
divisors, as in [23].

In particular, the N + 1 baryons BA

n deﬁned in (6.9) naturally correspond to the
family of divisors obtained by rotating D1 (or D2). The generic divisor in this family is
described by the zero-locus of the polynomial of degree-one:
c1,c2(Z 1, Z 2) ≡ c1Z 1 + c2Z 2 = 0 .
P A

(6.41)

The divisor does not change if we rescale c1 and c2 by the same complex number. Hence
diﬀerent divisors in this family are parametrised by the point [c1 : c2] in a complex
projective space P1
[c1:c2]. In this notation
D1 ≡ DA
[0:1]. Correspondingly, by using the description (6.14) of X, the
polynomials P A
[c1:c2](z) of a non-trivial
line bundle over X, such that D[c1:c2] = {ζ A

c1,c2(Z 1, Z 2) are associated with global sections ζ A

A. We then denote this class of divisors by DA

[1:0] and D2 ≡ DA

[c1:c2](z) = 0}.

In order to evaluate the vev of the baryons BA

in terms of the HEFT chiral ﬁelds,
we use the semiclassical results of Section 5. All the divisors DA
[c1:c2] are diﬀeomorphic
to C2 and have boundaries ΣA
[c1:c2]) = 0 and
[c1:c2]; Z) = 0, so that the corresponding E3-brane can support just a trivial ﬂat
H1(ΣA
connection. Since we have chosen the harmonic form ω to be Poincar´e dual to D1, and
then to any DA

7 Discussion

In this paper we have identiﬁed the holographic eﬀective ﬁeld theory (HEFT) describing
the low-energy dynamics of a large class of strongly-coupled N = 1 CFTs at the generic

41

points of their moduli space, at which the superconformal symmetry is spontaneously
broken. These CFTs corresponds to IR ﬁxed points of quiver gauge theories engineered
by placing N D3-branes at the tip of a Calabi-Yau cone C(Y ) over a Sasaki-Einstein
space Y . Our HEFT is deﬁned, at the two-derivative order, in terms of a non-trivial
K¨ahler potential for an appropriate set of chiral ﬁelds, which parametrise the open and
closed string moduli of the dual holographic background. We have outlined how these
HEFT chiral ﬁelds determine the vev of the CFT chiral ﬁelds. In particular, we have
provided a semiclassical formula for the vev of baryonic operators, extending the results
of [4, 5]. We have also provided an alternative description of the geometry of the moduli
space determined by the HEFT, in terms of a mixed complex-symplectic potential, whose
geometrical interpretation is more transparent and which is more directly connected with
the classical description of the CFT moduli space. Our general results have been explicitly
applied to the Klebanov-Witten model [2].

In the paper we have mostly assumed to be at the generic point in the moduli space,
at which the D3-branes are separated. On the other hand, our HEFT breaks down once
some D3-branes coincide. Indeed, we know that at these points the low-energy theory
must contain some N = 4 SYM sectors. For instance, suppose that all N D3-branes
coincide at a point of coordinates zi
c. The supergravity background is well deﬁned and
close to the coinciding D3-brane it develops a mildly curved AdS5 × S5 background
supporting N units of F5 ﬂux, as in [4]. Such throat corresponds to the appearance of a
SU (N ) N = 4 SYM theory in the IR, to which the UV CFT ﬂows. On the other hand,
as it is clear from the holographic description, the closed string moduli and the open
string center-of-mass moduli zi
c should still appear as dynamical degrees of freedom in
a low-energy eﬀective theory. Assuming that the dynamics of the N = 4 SYM sector
decouples from the moduli dynamics, one may derive an HEFT for the latter just by
substituting all zi
c in the formulas obtained in the present paper. Clearly, this
procedure can be adapted to more general cases in which the D3-branes form smaller
groups.

I with zi

The HEFT has been derived starting from the ten-dimensional supergravity and per-
forming a tree-level dimensional reduction. Hence, a priori, it is valid only for small string
coupling and small curvatures. While we can always justify the tree-level approximation
by choosing a small enough string coupling gs, which is a non-dynamical marginal pa-
rameter, the curvature corrections may become important in some region of the moduli
space. In particular, the internal space of the string background is provided by a smooth
Calabi-Yau resolution X of C(Y ), hosting N back-reacting D3-branes. There are then
two sources of curvature: one associated with curvature of the underlying Calabi-Yau
metric itself and one associated with the warping produced by the D3-branes.

Let us ﬁrst focus on the Calabi-Yau curvature. The K¨ahler moduli va measure, in

42

string units, the Einstein-frame volumes of the two-cycles present in the smooth space
X. Then, the ten-dimensional supergravity approximation we started from is expected to
√
be valid only when the corresponding string-frame volumes are large in string units, i.e.
va (cid:29) 1/
gs. On the other hand, at the level of the HEFT such condition is not sensible,
because of the underlying conformal symmetry. Indeed, if all va are non-vanishing, by an
appropriate dilation we can always make them arbitrarily large. Since under this dilation
the complete HEFT must be invariant, we can always choose to compute it in the regime
in which all va are large enough and the Calabi-Yau geometry is well described by the
leading ten-dimensional supergravity.

We can now turn to the warping. Asymptotically, the warping produces the AdS5×Y
geometry with string frame radius Rst ∼ (cid:96)s(gsN ) 1
4 . As usual, the conditions gs (cid:28) 1 and
Rst/(cid:96)s (cid:29) 1 require the large-N limit with large ‘t Hooft coupling λYM = gsN , which may
be interpreted as a diagonal combination of the quiver gauge couplings. As one moves
closer to the D3-branes, in the generic vacua at which they are not coincident, the space
develops N local strongly curved AdS5 × S5 throats. Even if AdS5 × S5 is an exact string
background [16], one may wonder whether higher order corrections due to such strongly
curved warping can aﬀect the HEFT. We do not have a deﬁnitive answer to this question.
However, we observe that the warping enters as an ‘integrated’ quantity in the HEFT,
eﬀectively disappearing from it and leaving just the dependence on the positions of the
D3-branes which source it. Hence, our HEFT does not ‘see’ such localised divergences.
To further support this idea, we observe that the dilation discussed above stretches
also the distance between the D3-branes. This means that, generically, we can as-
sume that the Calabi-Yau radius of curvature and the mutual distance between the
non-coincident D3-branes is much larger than the string length (cid:96)s. In this case, since
the strongly curved regions are localised around the D3-branes, each D3-brane should be
well approximated by a probe D3-brane on a weakly curved background generated by the
remaining N −1 D3-branes. By consistency, our HEFT should then reproduce the kinetic
metric for the moduli zi
I obtained by considering the I-th D3-brane as a probe. Indeed,
by expanding the corresponding DBI action one gets −2πgi¯(zI, ¯zI)∂µzi
I. Notice that
any explicit dependence on the warping has dropped out and so the probe D3-brane ‘sees’
only the underlying Calabi-Yau metric. This happens basically because of the mutual
BPS-ness of the D3-branes. We see that HEFT Lagrangian (3.8) perfectly matches the
probe expectation.

I∂µ ¯z¯

The above observations suggest that our second derivative HEFT may in fact admit
a broader regime of validity than naively expected. It would be very interesting to check
this possibility more explicitly, by directly studying the implication of the perturbative
higher derivative contributions to the ten-dimensional supergravity. Another source of
correction could come from non-perturbative corrections arising from various kinds of

43

world-sheet or brane instantons.
In this respect, it would be important to inspect in
detail other explicit models, which for instance include anomalous baryonic symmetries.
Indeed, in such cases b4(X) (cid:54)= 0 and there could be potential corrections arising from
supersymmetric D3-brane instantons.

Furthermore, our approach implicitly assumes that, at suﬃciently low energies, our
HEFT massless ﬁelds are decoupled from the massive four-dimensional states which would
be associated to possible normalisable non-zero modes of the internal supergravity con-
ﬁguration. It would be interesting to investigate the spectrum of such non-zero modes
and more explicitly study their impact on the HEFT.

Finally, we observe that the methods of the present paper can have a broader range
of potential applications. For instance, they have an obvious counterpart for the holo-
graphic models which are dual to N = 2 three-dimensional CFTs. Furthermore, the
holographic string backgrounds can be considered as local strongly warped regions of
proper compactiﬁcations and indeed our HEFTs can be generalised to describe local
sectors of phenomenologically motivated string models.

considered in this paper.

consider the axio-dilaton and complex structure moduli as frozen, while there may be
additional axionic moduli, associated with the C2, B2 and the seven-brane Wilson lines.
We will be interested only in the C2 and B2 moduli. However, in order to simplify the
presentation, we initially assume that they are absent.

As explained in [7], the K¨ahler potential is just given by

K = −3 log(4πv0a) .

The deﬁnition of the proper chiral ﬁelds ρA parametrising the K¨ahler deformations (and
the axionic partners) requires the introduction of a set of (locally deﬁned) ‘potentials’
κA(z, ¯z; v) such that

ωA = i∂ ¯∂κA .

A.2 Dual formulation with linear multiplets
Eventually, we want to take the decompactiﬁcation/MP → ∞ limit of the ﬂux compactiﬁ-
cations described in subsection A.1. As we will see, such limit is more naturally described
in the dual formulation in terms of linear multiplets (lA, H A), with lA real scalars and
H A = dbA real 3-forms, which are dual to the chiral multiplets ρA. The scalar component
lA is related to ReρA by (see for instance [45] for a review)

A.3 Rigid limit
We now consider a decompactiﬁcation of the above general setting such that MP → ∞.
Recalling (A.18), we see that the decompactiﬁcation limit can be obtained by sending
v0 → ∞, keeping a and Φ ﬁxed.

From (A.19) it is clear that the parametrisation of the linear multiplets breaks down

in this limit. Hence, it is convenient to rescale them as follows

lA → − 1
4v0

lA ,

H A → − 1
4v0

H A ,

so that we have the new identiﬁcation

lA =

In terms of such rescaled ﬁelds the Lagrangian (A.22) becomes

(A.26)
On the other hand, after the decompactiﬁcation, the universal modulus a as well as Φ
become non-dynamical constant parameters. Hence we can actually substitute (lA, H A)
by new liner multiplets (vA,HA), with vA = alA and HA = aH A, and set Φ = 1, so that
the eﬀective theory becomes

We can now take the decompactiﬁcation/MP → ∞ limit by sending v0 → ∞. Further-
more, we can also take the limit a → 0, which is relevant for the near-horizon geometries
considered in the present paper. It is clear that generically, in such limits, only a subset
of linear multiplets (va,Ha) remain dynamical and do not decouple. These are selected
by the condition that their kinetic terms do not diverge and remain ﬁnite, that is:

Gab ≡

e−4Aωa ∧ ∗ωb < ∞ .

(A.28)

ωA = ωP

We refer to the harmonic forms ωa satisfying (A.28) as Lw

2 -normalisable.

Hence, the rigid low-energy eﬀective theory is given by the restriction of (A.27) to
2 -normalisable linear multiplets (va,Ha). One can then dualise the result back to a
the Lw
rigid supersymmetric Lagrangian using chiral ﬁelds ρa. In fact, one can obtain the dual
Lagrangian directly from (A.15), by keeping just the chiral ﬁelds ρa corresponding to the
Lw
2 -normalisable harmonic 2-forms ωa. By using (A.18) and choosing Φ = 1 as above, we
obtain

Inclusion of B2 and C2 axions

C2 and B2 moduli can be included along the same lines. We ﬁrst need to identify a set
of L2-normalisable harmonic forms ˆωα, such that

(cid:90)

ˆωα ∧ ∗ˆωβ < ∞ .

(A.30)

X

Let us assume that e−4A is at most asymptotically constant as one approaches the bound-
ary of the non-compact X. Then Lw
2 - and L2-normalisable harmonic forms coincide if
e−4A is asymptotically constant, while they can diﬀer when e−4A is asymptotically van-
ishing, as in the holographic backgrounds considered in this paper. In these backgrounds,
the L2-normalisability condition is stronger and the L2-normalisable harmonic forms ˆωα
form a subset of the Lw
2 -normalisable harmonic forms ωa. Hence, as in section 2.3, we
can split ωa in two sets (ˆωα, ˜ωσ), where ˜ωσ are not L2-normalisable, and expand

C2 − τ B2 = (cid:96)2

s (βα ˆωα + λσ ˜ωσ) .

(A.31)

The coeﬃcients βα are dynamical moduli entering the four-dimensional eﬀective theory,
while λσ are ﬁxed non-dynamical parameters. By applying the above rigid limit to the
theory which includes such moduli [7] one arrives at the (rigid) eﬀective Lagrangian (3.8).
Notice that the application of the rigid/decompactiﬁcation limit v0 → ∞ and the
near-horizon limit a → 0 directly on the deﬁnition of chiral coordiantes ρa (A.13) (com-
pleted by the appropriate dependence on the βα moduli [7]) and the K¨ahler potential
(A.11) is more subtle. For the backgrounds considered in the present paper, it is then
easier to directly check that the formulas provided in section 3 – see equations (3.2) and
(3.12) – give the correct eﬀective Lagrangian.

B A useful formula

Take the cone C(Y ) over the Sasaki-Einstein space Y . Y can be regarded as a foliation
parametrised by the variable ψ, whose local transverse space B has a natural K¨ahler
structure jB associated with a transverse metric ds2
B. Then the metric on C(Y ) can be
written as

ds2

C(Y ) = dr2 + r2ds2

Y ,

with

ds2

Y = η2 + ds2

B ,

(B.1)

(B.2)

where η is the contact form, dual to the Reeb Killing vector. Note that dη = jB and η
can be locally written as

η = dψ + C ,

(B.3)

where C is a locally deﬁned 1-form on B, such that dC = 2jB. On C(Y ) we can introduce
the following vielbein and co-vielbein

E1 = ∂r , E2 =

1
r

∂ψ , Ea =

1
r

(B.4)

E1 = dr , E2 = rη , Ea = rea ,

where ea (ea), a = 3, . . . , 6, is a local (co)vielbein on B and Ca = ιeaC. Furthermore we
can choose a co-vielbein ea such that we can write

2

J =

d(r2η) = rdr ∧ η + r2jB = E1 ∧ E2 + E3 ∧ E4 + E5 ∧ E6 .

(B.5)
Consider now a conical non-compact divisor D (cid:39) R+ × Σ, with Σ ⊂ Y and conical
Σ. We would like to express in a more useful form the

D = dr2 + r2ds2

induced metric ds2
quantity

J (D, rc) =

dvolY J(cid:121)δ2(D)

(B.6)
where Yc ≡ {r = rc} is the transversal ﬁve-dimensional slice isomorphic to Y . We can
then make the following manipulations

Yc

(cid:90)

(cid:0)ea − Ca∂ψ

(cid:1) ,

J (D, rc) =

η ∧ jB ∧ jB[J(cid:121)δ2(D)] =

J mn

ιmιn[δ1(Yc) ∧ E2 ∧ J ∧ J] ∧ δ2(D) .

(B.7)

Now, since δ1(Yc) = δ(r − rc)dr and δ2(D) has legs along E3, . . . , E6, we arrive at

J (D, rc) =
