In the global phase diagram of 227 pyrochlore iridates, Pr2Ir2O7 resides in the proximity of a
metal-insulator transition, supporting an anomalous Hall eﬀect below 1.5 K, and the normal state
of this material is described by a parabolic semimetal with quadratic band touching at the Γ point.
For such a parabolic semimetal which is believed to be the parent state of many 227 pyrochlore
iridate compounds, we demonstrate a strong competition between the “spin ice” and “all in-all
out” orders, and based on a Landau theory we construct possible global phase diagrams for this
class of materials. When “spin ice” order has the dominant susceptibility, we show that the low
temperature phase displays an itinerant “3-in, 1-out” order. For a generic model of particle-hole
anisotropic parabolic semimetal, the “3-in, 1-out” order is an admixture of both “spin ice” and “all
in-all out” spin conﬁgurations on Ir tetrahedron. The “3-in, 1-out” order gives rise to a Weyl metal
with two Weyl nodes along one of the eight possible [1,1,1] directions supporting a large anomalous
Hall eﬀect without any appreciable magnetic moment for Ir4+ and Pr3+ ions, as observed in Pr2Ir2O7
at low temperatures. The anomalous Hall conductivity inside the “3-in, 1-out” ordered phase varies
as square root of the magnetization.
Inside the metallic “3-in, 1-out” phase, the “spin ice” and
“all in-all out” components couple to the ﬂuctuating T2g quadrupolar order parameter, leading
to a small nematicity. Since an externally applied strain along [1,1,1] direction induces a static
T2g quadrupolar order, we show how it can amplify the “3-in, 1-out” order, raising the possibility
of observing anomalous Hall eﬀect at higher temperatures. Overall, the physics of Pr2Ir2O7 is
determined by a subtle combination of strong electronic correlation, competing orders and nodal
topology, making it a unique system in the family of 227 pyrochlore iridates.

INTRODUCTION

One of the central themes in condensed matter physics
is the emergence of new phases of matter in interact-
ing many-body systems, which is succinctly captured by
Anderson’s famous dictum “more is diﬀerent”1. This is
equally applicable to classical and quantum phases of
matter. For example, a liquid is an emergent interme-
diate phase between a gas and a solid that can only ex-
ist in an interacting but macroscopically large system of
atoms or molecules. Similarly, magnetism, superﬂuid-
ity, superconductivity are all examples of collective phe-
nomena arising only in thermodynamically large corre-
lated systems, possessing ∼ 1023 constituent particles.
The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking provides
an organizing principle for addressing new phases, and
the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory of local or-
der parameter constitutes a paradigm for describing both
symmetry preserving as well as symmetry breaking states
on an equal footing. The LGW theory also provides a
conceptual framework for understanding the phenomena
of scale invariance and universality for continuous phase
transitions (thermal and quantum) occurring in appar-
ently diﬀerent systems2.

The phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials
such as cuprates, heavy fermions,
iron pnictides and
ruthenates support several competing broken symmetry
phases at low temperatures, and their interplay usually
gives rise to very rich phenomenology over a wide range
of temperatures. As long as the low temperature phases

can be described in terms of spontaneously broken global
symmetry and local order parameters (thus excluding
the exotic spin liquid or fractional quantum Hall type of
phases requiring nonlocal description), the LGW theory
serves as the basic framework for addressing the complex
phase diagrams. Only the strange metal phases occur-
ring in the quantum critical regions are known to defy
the conventional understanding in terms of LGW theory
as well as the canonical description of a metal in terms
of Landau’s Fermi liquid theory2. Therefore, a compre-
hensive understanding of the entire phase diagrams in
strongly correlated materials generally requires comple-
mentary and often fundamentally new theoretical meth-
ods. However, the qualitative understanding of the global
phase diagrams always comes from studying the prevail-
ing broken symmetry phases at low temperatures.

Even though the low temperature phases cannot be
generally described in terms of original strongly inter-
acting electrons, the broken symmetry phase admits an
eﬃcient description in terms of weakly interacting emer-
gent fermionic excitations, known as quasiparticles. The
recent progress in the topological classiﬁcation of free-
fermion Hamiltonians has added a new notion of emer-
gence to this well established description of broken sym-
metry phases. Even after the broken global symmetry is
speciﬁed, the mean-ﬁeld ground state can belong to topo-
logically distinct sectors, and both fully gapped and gap-
less states can admit topological classiﬁcation3–5. Con-
sequently two topologically distinct phases, breaking the
same global symmetry can be separated by a novel quan-

tum phase transition that falls outside the paradigm of
LGW theory. Therefore, the interplay of electronic cor-
relation and topology of quasiparticles is emerging as a
new frontier for modern condensed matter research. The
current work involves a class of correlated iridium oxides.
By focusing on the enigmatic example of Pr2Ir2O7, here
we develop a theory for the global phase diagram of 227
pyrochlore iridates, showing that the system manifests
an intriguing conﬂuence of competing orders, exotic mag-
netism, and topological properties (of chiral Weyl quasi-
particles).

Owing to the comparably strong spin orbit coupling
and on-site Coulomb repulsion for 5d electrons, Ir based
oxides can support metal-insulator transitions (MIT),
diﬀerent magnetic orders, topological phases and exotic
spin liquid behaviors6–8. In this context, 227 pyrochlore
iridate compounds Ln2Ir2O7 (with Ln being a lanthanide
element) have attracted considerable experimental and
theoretical interest9–36. Remarkably it was ﬁrst predicted
in Ref. 10 that an “all in-all out” (AIAO) order can
support topological Weyl quasiparticles. However the
AIAO ordered state does not support anomalous Hall ef-
fect (AHE) due to the preserved cubic symmetry. Given
the tremendous ongoing interest in Weyl semimetal, it
is a natural question to ask whether the notion of Weyl
quasiparticles can provide a resolution of any outstand-
ing problem for a strongly correlated material. It turns

2

Before discussing

the

anomalous properties

out that among all 227 pyrochlore iridates, Pr2Ir2O7 is
the only material that exhibits a large anomalous Hall
eﬀect (AHE) with σH ∼ 103 Ω−1 m−1 along the [1, 1, 1]
direction in the temperature interval 0.3 K < T < 1.5 K
without any appreciable magnetic moment per Pr3+ ion
(< 10−3µB) 22–24.
In addition it displays a metamag-
netic transition only when an external magnetic ﬁeld is
applied along the [1,1,1] direction22,23. These experimen-
tal results have been interpreted as strong evidence for a
metallic, chiral spin liquid phase22–24, which has led to
considerable theoretical activity28–35. Here we will show
that the Weyl quasiparticles of a metallic “3-in, 1-out”
(3I1O) order can produce a large AHE along [1,1,1] direc-
tion without any appreciable magnetic moment, and we
propose that the resulting Weyl metal is capable of ex-
plaining the enigmatic experimental results on Pr2Ir2O7.
of
21–26, we provide some perspectives on the lo-
Pr2Ir2O7
cation of this material in the global phase diagram of
227 pyrochlore iridates.
Irrespective of the actual na-
ture of the lanthanide ion, most of the 227 iridate com-
pounds display insulating ground states9 and presum-
ably AIAO order at low temperatures10–19. For example,
we can compare three adjacent materials with Ln=Eu,
Sm and Nd,
in the global phase diagram of 227 iri-
dates. The ground states of Eu3+, Sm3+ and Nd3+
ions are respectively non-magnetic, dipolar Kramers dou-
blet, and dipolar-octupolar Kramers doublet. But, all
three compounds show MIT and AIAO order. However,
with increasing ionic radius of the lanthanide element
(REu ∼ 1.065˚A, RSm ∼ 1.08˚A, RN d ∼ 1.15˚A), the MIT
temperature (TMI) gradually decreases from 120 K to 117
K to 33 K. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the
correlations among 5d electrons of Ir4+ play the dominant
role in determining the global phase diagram of 227 iri-
dates, while the size of Ln3+ provides the crucial control
parameter for tuning the strength of electronic interac-
tions.
It is worth mentioning that by applying hydro-
static pressure on Nd2Ir2O7, a metal-insulator quantum
phase transition (QPT) can be observed around a critical
pressure pc ∼ 5 GPa20. Similarly substituting Nd3+ with
larger Pr3+ ion (RP r ∼ 1.25˚A) one applies chemical pres-
sure, and TMI can be systematically suppressed to zero
for Nd2−2xPr2xIr2O7 around a critical value xc ∼ 0.820.
Therefore, within the material class of 227 pyrochlore iri-
dates, Pr2Ir2O7 stands out as a unique system that lies
in the proximity of a metal-insulator QPT, but remains
metallic down to the lowest temperatures.

Recent laser ARPES experiments on Pr2Ir2O7 have re-
vealed the existence of a semimetallic phase arising due
to the quadratic band touching between two Kramers
degenerate conduction and valence bands at the Γ point
(k = [0, 0, 0])26. Since the ground state of Pr is a non-
Kramers doublet of Eg character, the localized f elec-
trons possess Ising dipolar moments in addition to Eg
quadrupolar moments27. Due to strong frustration, the
system does not show any magnetic ordering well below
the Curie-Weiss temperature TCW = −20K 21. While a

FIG. 2: (Color online) Possible phase diagrams due to competing SI and AIAO orders as suggested by a phenomenological
Landau theory, where T is the temperature and t ∼ Ec, where Ec is the bandwidth and g is the strength of electronic interaction.
Here m1 and m2 are eﬀective mass parameters in the Luttinger Hamiltonian [see Eq. (2)]. The 3I1O state is an admixture of
TSI and AIAO orders. (a), (b) and (c) describe the generic phase diagrams in the absence of particle-hole anisotropy and an
underlying Fermi surface in the normal state, while those in the presence of a Fermi surface and/or particle-hole asymmetry are
shown in (c), (d) and (e). The red and blue dots respectively denote tetracritical and bicritical points. The green dot represents
a multicritical point where three lines of continuous transitions meet. In (b) and (e) two ordered phases are separated by ﬁrst
order transitions. Both TSI and 3I1O phases support anomalous Hall eﬀect along one of the eight possible [1,1,1] directions.
However inside 3I1O phase, the size of the Hall conductivity decreases with increasing strength of AIAO component. This
prediction can be tested in Nd2−2xPr2xIr2O7. Based on our theory, we expect the strength of AHE to systematically decrease
as x is gradually lowered from 1, and it should vanish around the putative critical doping xc = 0.8 below which the system
presumably displays AIAO order. Based on whether the anomalous Hall conductivity vanishes continuously or discontinuously
one can determine the nature of the transition between 3I1O and AIAO orders and distinguish between phase diagrams in (d)
and (e).

ferromagnetic exchange coupling between dipolar Ising
moments of Pr (mediated by O 2p states28–30) can be
reconciled with spin ice (SI) correlations observed at low
temperatures22–24, it is at odds with the observed anti-
ferromagnetic sign of TCW . Akin to many heavy fermion
compounds, Pr2Ir2O7 shows a resistivity minimum21.
One also ﬁnds spin freezing below 0.3 K22,23.

Generally it is assumed that a Kondo-Heisenberg
Hamiltonian H = HIr,KE + HIr,Int + HP r + HP r−Ir can
describe the low energy physics of this material, where
HIr,KE and HIr,Int respectively correspond to the kinetic
energy and the inter-electron interaction for Ir. The ex-
change interaction between Pr local moments is denoted
by HP r and HIr,P r is the Kondo coupling between itiner-
ant electrons and local moments. Most theoretical pro-
posals have assumed the exchange interaction of Pr as
the dominant energy scale and focused on exotic mag-
netic conﬁgurations (antiferroquadrupolar order of non-
Kramers doublet28,29, Kagome ice31, coexisting magnetic
and quadrupolar order34 and spin liquid35) for Pr3+ lo-
cal moments that can arise due to HP r in the presence of
strong geometrical frustration. Within this scenario, the
AHE arises due to a Berry phase acquired by the innocu-
ous Ir4+ electrons, while moving in a nontrivial magnetic
background of Pr3+ moments. We revisit the important
question of whether Ir or Pr ions play the key role in the
relevant physics here, and come to a diﬀerent conclusion.
In our analysis of Pr2Ir2O7, we depart from this line of
reasoning. Due to the close proximity to MIT, we believe
that HIr,Int provides a comparable or larger energy scale
than the exchange interaction among Pr moments. Hence
we need to address how SI and AIAO orders can compete
in the proximity of MIT. By focusing on HIr,KE +HIr,Int

we investigate the relative stability of AIAO, “2-in, 2-
out” (2I2O) and “3-in, 1-out” (3I1O) conﬁgurations for
Ir-tetrahedron, which are shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel).
For the semimetal phase arising out of HIr,KE we ﬁnd
comparable critical couplings for SI and AIAO orders, as
shown in Fig. 1(d). Depending on the nature of the cu-
bic anisotropy, either order can become the ground state
for moderately strong electronic interaction, while very
large electronic interaction generically prefers AIAO or-
der (see Fig. 2). If the ground state displays a uniaxial SI
order with underlying magnetic moment along ˆx or ˆy or
ˆz direction, the quasiparticles can support AHE in yz or
zx or xy plane respectively (see Sec. III). However when
SI order is favored, an equal superposition of three de-
generate 2I2O conﬁgurations denoted as the triplet spin
ice (TSI) order is energetically favorable due to the cubic
anisotropy. The TSI gives rise to a magnetic moment and
a net chirality (due to noncoplanar spin arrangements)
along one of the eight possible [1,1,1] directions, and a
Weyl semimetal (WSM) with two Weyl nodes along the
[1,1,1] direction. Consequently it can support a large
AHE in a plane perpendicular to [1,1,1], without any
strong magnetic moment for either Ir4+ or Pr3+.

We predict the global phase diagrams of 227 py-
rochlore iridate based on a Landau theory of compet-
ing orders. For an idealized particle-hole symmetric
parabolic semimetal Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c)
capture three possible phase diagrams in the T (temper-
ature) vs. g plane, and g is determined by the strength
of electronic interaction. For a particle-hole asymmetric
parabolic semimetal we show that the TSI order induces
a small component of AIAO order, leading to a general
form of 3I1O state. Given the underlying particle-hole

Fig. 2(c), Fig. 2(d) and Fig. 2(e) are the three possible
generic global phase diagrams of 227 iridates. The 3I1O
state shown in Fig. 2(d) and 2(e) will be accompanied
by a small lattice distortion along [1,1,1] direction, which
causes T2g mechanical strain. Furthermore, we show how
an externally applied T2g strain along [1,1,1] direction can
enhance the 3I1O order and consequently the AHE may
be observable at relatively higher temperatures.

In experiments how the diﬀerent parts of a phase
diagram are accessed will depend on the applied non-
thermal tuning parameters such as hydrostatic pressure,
chemical substitution and magnetic ﬁeld. The generic
phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates, shown in Figs. 2(d)
and 2(e), can be experimentally veriﬁed through the
measurement of anomalous Hall conductivity (σH ) on
Nd2−2xPr2xIr2O7. As the concentration of Nd is gradu-
ally increased in this compound, we expect the strength
of AHE to gradually decrease. Finally across a critical
Nd-doping (xc = 0.8) the system is expected to enter
into the AIAO phase that does not support any AHE20.
Whether σH vanishes continuously (Fig. 2(d)) or discon-
tinuously (Fig. 2(e)) can distinguish these two possibili-
ties. On the other hand metal-insulator QPT induced by
hydrostatic pressure can in principle correspond to either
of the three situations depicted in Figs. 2(c), 2(d) and
2(e). The phase diagram of Fig. 2(c) will show no AHE in
the parabolic semimetal side. Therefore measurement of
AHE or magnetooptical properties are required at p > pc
to determine the actual nature of the metallic state ob-
tained through hydrostatic pressure.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II
we discuss the tight-binding model and the eﬀective low
energy band structure of 5d itinerant electrons of Ir. The
Sec. III is devoted to the discussion of competing mag-
netic order parameters and their chirality due to non-
coplanar spin arrangements, and their coupling to un-
derlying gapless fermions. Here we also describe the
instabilities of a parabolic semimetal toward magneti-
cally ordered ground states. The fermion spectra, nodal
topology, and the possibility of AHE in various magnetic
ground states are discussed Sec. IV. The explanation of
AHE in Pr2Ir2O7 in terms of Weyl metal phase induced
by the 3I1O order is provided in Sec. V. Based on a phe-
nomenological Landau theory we address the competi-
tion among dominant magnetic orders in Sec. VI and
obatin the possible phase diagrams for 227 pyrocholore
iridates.
In Sec. VII we discuss the eﬀects of external
strain and magnetic ﬁelds on the competing orders. We
summarize our ﬁndings and provide some future direc-
tions in Sec. VIII. The technical aspects of deriving the
Luttinger model beginning with a tight-binding Hamil-
tonian and the coupling between itinerant fermions and
magnetic order parameters are respectively provided in
Appendix A and Appendix B.

A. SI, AIAO and 3I1O magnetic orders

ˆbi, where

The task is considerably simpliﬁed if we restrict our-
selves to the dominant magnetic orders such as AIAO, SI
and 3I1O, for which ni ∝ ˆbi, and ˆbis are four unit vectors
directed from the center of the tetrahedron to its four
vertices. Hence we can represent ni = Φi
Φ1 = ϕ + M1 − M2 − M3, Φ2 = ϕ + M1 + M2 + M3,
Φ3 = ϕ − M1 − M2 + M3, Φ4 = ϕ − M1 + M2 − M3,(7)
and the AIAO and the SI order parameters are respec-
tively denoted by an Ising variable ϕ and a three compo-
nent vector M. The component Mj couples to an under-
lying 2I2O conﬁguration, which produces a net magnetic
moment for the Ir-tetrahedron along the C4v direction ˆj
(namely ±ˆx, ±ˆy, ±ˆz). Within the SI manifold, the TSI
order is described by one of the eight possible conﬁgura-
tions with

violating the ice rule (since(cid:80)
causes violation of ice rule, as follows from(cid:80)

giving rise to a 3I1O conﬁguration (see Fig. 1(c)) without
i Φi = 0, where the sum is
over the four sites of the tetrahedron), with a magnetic
moment ∝ |M| along one of the eight C3v directions.
When both TSI and AIAO orders coexist (M (cid:54)= 0, ϕ (cid:54)= 0)
a general form of 3I1O conﬁguration is realized, which
i Φi = 4ϕ.
The magnetic moment for such a coexisting phase is still
determined by |M|. However, compared to a pure TSI
state, the size of the moment will be diminished inside
a coexisting phase. After decoupling the Hubbard inter-
action in terms of ϕ and M, we ﬁnd equal coupling con-
stant U/12 for both AIAO and SI order parameters. How-
ever, the coupling constants for these orders can be made
diﬀerent by considering an extended form of interaction
such as U − V − J model, where J < 0 (> 0) favors
SI (AIAO) order. Next we discuss the direction of mag-
netic moment and chirality for each of these noncoplanar
magnetic orders.

B. Magnetic moment and chirality

We ﬁrst provide the formula for the magnetic mo-
ment of the aforementioned orders. For convenience we
choose four sites of the tetrahedron (j = 1, 2, 3, 4), as
shown in Fig. 3, to be located at r1 = [−1, 1, 1]/2, r2 =
[−1,−1,−1]/2, r3 = [1, 1,−1]/2, r4 = [1,−1, 1]/2, while
the center of the tetrahedron is placed at rc = [0, 0, 0].
The four vectors pointing from the sites to the center of
the tetrahedron are b1 = [1,−1,−1]/2, b2 = [1, 1, 1]/2,

6

which is displayed in Table I for various magnetic con-
ﬁgurations. Notice that C and m point along the same
direction. Next we consider the coupling between the or-
der parameters and the underlying gapless fermions and
address the instabilities of a parabolic semimetal toward
magnetically ordered states.

In the spin ice conﬁguration,
denoted by SIjk, spin at site j and k points away from the
center of the tetrahedron. Inside the 3I1Oj phase, spin at the
jth site points outwards from the center of the tetrahedron,
while spin at remaining three sites point toward the center of
the tetrahedron. A 1I3Oj conﬁguration is obtained by ﬂipping
all spins from a 3I1Oj conﬁguration. Notice that net chirality
of a TSI order, obtained from equal superposition of three SI
order, such as SI13, SI23 and SI34, is aligned along the net
chirality of a 1I3O conﬁguration, 1I3O1 in this case.

where Γbc = [Γb, Γc]/(2i), and Ψ is a four component
spinor. Notice that SI order is an admixture of dipolar
and octupolar quantities (both following T1u representa-
tion of cubic point group), while AIAO order is purely an
octupolar object (following A2u representation). To ad-
dress the competition between these two orders we have
to ﬁnd the condensation energy inside the ordered phase
by computing the fermion determinant. This task can be
simpliﬁed by restricting ourselves to the low energy sub-
space of the quadratically touching bands. Even though
such simpliﬁcation is not appropriate for strong electronic
interactions (comparable to the bandwidth or the spin or-
bit splitting), we still obtain valuable insight regarding
the leading order instabilities of the normal state.

At the leading order, the instability toward magnetic
ordering can be addressed from the bare susceptibilities
of the order parameters. For simplicity let us consider
a particle-hole symmetric parabolic semimetal. The sus-
ceptibility of AIAO and SI order parameters (at zero ex-
ternal frequency and momentum) are respectively given

(10)

We now demonstrate how the magnetic orders with non-
coplanar arrangements of spin give rise to a scalar chi-
rality for each face of the tetrahedron, and a relation be-
tween the net chirality (C) and the underlying magnetic
moment m.

The scalar chiralities through the four surfaces of an
Ir tetrahedron (denoted by index l and enclosed by sites
i, j and k, such that l (cid:54)= i, j, k) are given by

C1 = s2 · (s4 × s3) , C2 = s3 · (s4 × s1) ,
C3 = s2 · (s1 × s4) , C4 = s3 · (s1 × s2) ,

(11)

where sjs are expectation values of the spin operators at
the jth site of the tetrahedron. The net chirality of a
magnetic conﬁguration is deﬁned in the following way.
Let us deﬁne the vector connecting the center of the
tetrahedron and the center of the lth face by Sl, where
S1 = [1,−1,−1]/6, S2 = [1, 1, 1]/6, S3 = [−1,−1, 1]/6,
S4 = [−1, 1,−1]/6. The net chirality of a magnetic order

where Λ is the momentum cutoﬀ, indicating a strong
competition between them. Even though m1 and m2
are not generically equal, long range Coulomb interaction
tends to reduce the eﬀects of cubic anisotropy, leading to
m1 ∼ m2
arises due to the vanishing density of states ρ(E) ∼ √
40–42. The Λ dependence of the susceptibilities

at the band touching point, and the nucleation of any
static order parameter requires a critical strength of in-
teraction. For the isotropic model SI and AIAO orders
have equal critical couplings gc1 = gc2 = 5
2/64 as
shown in Fig. 1(d), where we have deﬁned dimensionless
coupling constants gjmpΛ/(8π22) → gj. However in the
presence of cubic anisotropy (m1 (cid:54)= m2), the degeneracy
of the critical couplings is lifted. For m1 < m2, the SI
ordering requires a smaller critical coupling (gc1 < gc2),
and the semimetal state ﬁrst becomes unstable toward
the SI order. By contrast, m2 < m1 favors AIAO or-
der as the dominant instability with gc2 < gc1. For very
strong Hubbard U (comparable or larger than the micro-
scopic bandwidth ∼ t1), the system is in the Mott limit
and the appropriate description of low energy physics is
provided by an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and
supports AIAO order, irrespective of the anisotropy pa-
rameter α14. This is reﬂected by the AIAO order shown
in Fig. 2 at strong coupling, which is not captured by
the instabilities of a parabolic semimetal. Given the un-
certainties regarding the actual microscopic model, it is
more useful to consider the competition between these
two orders in terms of an eﬀective Landau free energy.
However before discussing the detailed form of Landau
free energy and associated phase diagrams, we consider
the fermion dispersion relations within the broken sym-
metry phases, which allows us to understand the inter-
play between the nodal topology and AHE.

of dj(k)s.

the low energy thermodynamic and transport properties
of the AIAO phase are governed by the linearly dispersing
Weyl fermions. Due to the presence of cubic symmetry,
the net Berry ﬂux through any plane vanishes. Conse-
quently, the AIAO order does not support any AHE. The
absence of AHE is consistent with the absence of a net
chirality for the AIAO order.

B. SI order

The uniaxial SI order gives rise to a nodal ring in ad-
dition to two Weyl nodes. For example, the uniaxial SI
order with M = (0, 0, M3) leads to the spectra

Since magnetic ordering removes the Kramers degen-
eracy of the conduction and valence bands it can give rise
to Weyl nodes. It is worth pointing out that simultane-
ous diagonalization of ﬁve Γj (appearing in the Luttinger
model), three Γ45Γa (a=1,2,3) (describing the SI order)

Consequently, two bands with n = ±1, s = −1 touch
at two Weyl points located at (0, 0,±√
2m2M3/), and
also along a line node in the k3 = 0 plane. Similar co-
existence of two diﬀerent types of nodal quasiparticles
have been discussed in the context of kz(kx ± iky) and
kz(kx ± iky)2 pairings for URu2Si2
45 respec-
tively. The low energy density of states for the line and
the Weyl nodes respectively behave as ρ(E) ∼ |E| and
ρ(E) ∼ E2. Consequently, the thermodynamic proper-
ties for the ordered phase at low temperatures are domi-
nated by the line node. However, the Weyl nodes produce
a quantized 2π Berry ﬂux through the xy plane, leading
to an anomalous Hall current43,46,47

where E is the external electric ﬁeld and ∆k (cid:107) M is the
nodal separation vector pointing from the left handed
Weyl point to the right handed Weyl point. Therefore the
direction of AHE is determined by the direction of the net
magnetic moment and the net chirality. For the uniaxial
SI order with M = (0, 0, M3) we obtain the anomalous
Hall conductivity

Notice that the anomalous Hall conductivity depends on
the square root of the magnetization or the magnetic mo-
ment. The Weyl fermions also give rise to anomalous
thermal Hall and anomalous Nernst eﬀects in the xy
plane, in addition to the polar Kerr eﬀect and Faraday
rotation in optical measurements43,48. However a uniax-
ial SI order can only be nucleated by applying a suﬃ-
ciently strong magnetic ﬁeld along one of C4v axes, as
discussed in Subsection VII B. Due to the presence of a
strong magnetic ﬁeld the notion of AHE becomes moot.
But it still leaves the option of probing the power law be-
haviors of thermodynamic and transport properties due
to the line node (provided the strong ﬁeld does not cause
sharp Landau levels). However, the observed AHE along
[1,1,1] direction in Pr2Ir2O7 cannot be explained in terms
of such a uniaxial SI order, and we have to consider the
nodal topology of TSI and generic 3I1O orders.

Notice that the direction of AHE is fully consistent with
the directions of underlying magnetic moment and net

In the presence of both TSI and AIAO orders, the E-
linear term in the secular equation [see Eq. (17)] leads to
cumbersome analytical expressions for four bands. When
|M| >> |ϕ|, the small AIAO component tends to shift
the reference energies of two Weyl nodes. Therefore the
right and the left handed Weyl fermions respectively pro-
duce electron and hole pockets even at half-ﬁlling.
If
the amplitude of AIAO order is much bigger than the
TSI amplitude |M|, the net Berry ﬂux through the plane
perpendicular to [1,1,1] direction becomes nonzero. How-
ever, the resulting anomalous Hall conductivity is much
smaller than the one found for pure TSI phase. For con-
ventional 3I1O order (corresponding to |ϕ| = M ) we ﬁnd
simpler expressions

for the spectra, from which we can clearly see that the
two Weyl points along [1,1,1] direction are shifted in en-
ergy by an amount ∆E = 2ϕ = 2sgn(ϕ) M . Similar
energy shift also occurs for the other six Weyl points
discussed in the context of AIAO order. Finally, the
particle-hole anisotropy term makes the volume of elec-
tron and hole pockets diﬀerent.

AHE can also arise from purely dipolar ferromagnetic
order, which couples to the parabolic fermions accord-
ing to N · Ψ†JΨ. However due to strong geometrical
frustration the nucleation of conventional ferromagnetic
order is very unlikely and should be preempted by SI or-
der. We note that an important diﬀerence between SI
and ferromagnetic order parameters arises in the nodal
topology of the ordered phase. While the SI order gives
rise to single-Weyl fermions (which are single monopoles
of Berry curvature), the ferromagnetic order leads to
double-Weyl fermions (which are the double monopoles
of the Berry curvature)42. Both single and double Weyl
fermions support AHE and it is diﬃcult to distinguish
them based on the Hall conductivity. However this dif-
ference in nodal topology can be clearly distinguished
by determining the number of surface Fermi arcs (one
vs. two) through ARPES and Fourier transformed STM
measurements. In addition the diﬀerence in nodal topol-
ogy also manifests in the density of states for the low
energy quasiparticles49, which lead to distinct tempera-
ture and frequency dependent response functions. Now
we discuss how 3I1O order can account for the observed
AHE in Pr2Ir2O7.

V. PHYSICS OF Pr2Ir2O7

Based on the discussion in previous section we infer
that any itinerant SI order can give rise to a large AHE.
The amplitude of the SI order parameter (|M|) at T = 0
should be roughly given by kBT ∗ where T ∗ is the onset
temperature for the AHE, which can be estimated in the
following manner. The experimentally observed anoma-
lous Hall conductivity deﬁnes a length scale

l∗ =

e2
h

× 1
σH

≈ 3.8 × 10−8m.

(27)

After equating l∗ with the thermal de Broglie wavelength
for parabolic semimetal at T ∗, we ﬁnd

(cid:19)

(cid:18) h2

2m∗

|M| ≈ kBT ∗ =

× (1/l∗)2 ,

(28)

and m∗ is the eﬀective mass of the quadratically touching
bands. By using experimentally measured m∗ ∼ 6.3 me
where me is the mass of free electron26 we obtain kBT ∗ ∼
0.17 meV and T ∗ ∼ 1.9K. The corresponding magnetic
moment (magnetization × the volume of the unit cell)
per Ir ion can be estimated by employing Eq. (8). We
naturally expect the ratio M/U ≤ 10−4, and the mag-
netic moment of SI order to be |m| ≤ 10−4µB per Ir.

9

Thus experimentally observed large σH and smallness of
moment |m| can be easily reconciled by invoking itiner-
ant SI order. However, the direction of the AHE can only
be understood in terms of itinerant 3I1O order.

Even though a general form of 3I1O order along [1,1,1]
direction will be consistent with the experimentally ob-
served direction of AHE, for extracting qualitative es-
timates of the associated energy scales we will con-
sider the simplest form of 3I1O order, as described by
the [1,1,1] TSI conﬁguration.
If experimentally deter-
mined Hall conductivity 103 Ω−1m−1 is associated with
σxy = σyz = σzx of Eq. (24) the amplitude for TSI order
parameter will be

|M| ≈ 7.2 × 10−31/m1 meV.

Recent ARPES experiment does not ﬁnd any evidence of
strong cubic anisotropy, suggesting m1 ∼ m2 ≈ 6.3 me.
By choosing this value of m1 we will obtain
|M| ≈ 0.13 meV ⇒ T ∗ ≈ 1.5K,

which is consistent with the temperature scale for the on-
22–24. If we rather
set of an AHE, as observed in Pr2Ir2O7
take the maximum value of anomalous Hall conductivity
σH of Eq. (25) to be 103 Ω−1m−1, the amplitude of the
TSI order will be three times smaller and T ∗ ∼ 0.5K.
For 227 iridates the Hubbard U ∼ 1 eV, the estimated
magnetic moment per Ir is ∼ 10−5µB. Since experimen-
tal measurement of magnetization accounts for the net
moment coming from both Ir and Pr sublattices, we now
consider the role of Pr3+ ions.

The small magnetic moment of Ir will produce a small
eﬀective ﬁeld along [1,1,1] direction for Pr ions through
the Kondo coupling.
If the Kondo coupling is antifer-
romagnetic, magnetic moments of Ir and Pr will tend
to align along opposite directions, which can cause fur-
ther suppression of the net magnetic moment of the sys-
tem. Our estimated m is therefore consistent with ex-
perimental bound22–24. When an external magnetic ﬁeld
is applied along [1,1,1] direction, Pr moments will tend
to point along the external ﬁeld due to a larger Zee-
man coupling, while Ir moment will align along [-1,-1,-
1]. Therefore, the sign of AHE can be negative. At
least this occurs for a large value of external magnetic
ﬁeld24. Inside the TSI phase, the induced magnetic mo-
ment on Pr is nonuniversal and can be quite small due
to several reasons. The product of small itinerant Ir mo-
ment and a small scale of Kondo coupling produces a
very tiny eﬀective ﬁeld for Pr ions along [1,1,1] direction,
and it is inadequate to order Pr local moments. This
will certainly be compatible with antiﬀerromagnetic ex-
change coupling between local moments as suggested by
the negative TCW . The moments of Pr ion can also be
suppressed by geometric factors related to the unit cell
and the actual details of the Pr ions. The nonuniver-
sality of magnetic moment for the lanthanide ions have
also been observed inside the AIAO ordered insulating
state. For example, TM I for Tb2Ir2O7 and Er2Ir2O7 are

respectively 130 K and 140 K, but only the Tb3+ ex-
hibits a magnetic moment below T ∼ 40K 50. Therefore
we believe that the most important aspects of Pr2Ir2O7
in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld arise from Ir
sector. Only for a suﬃciently strong external magnetic
ﬁeld the Pr ions will play any important role. Now we
consider the eﬀects of competing SI and AIAO orders
on the global phase diagram of 227 pyrochlore iridates
within the framework of Landau theory.

The form of the Landau free energy and the result-

For simplicity we ﬁrst consider the particle-hole sym-
metric situation, when the band structure is entirely de-
termined by dj(k) and E0(k) = 0. When the Fermi level
is exactly pinned at the band-touching point, the SI and
AIAO orders can only couple through ϕ2M2 term at the
quartic order. The explicit form of the free energy density

both r1 and r2 are allowed to be negative. By contrast,
only AIAO order is allowed for m1 > m2, and only r2
can be negative.

We ﬁrst consider m1 < m2 and a parameter regime
r1 < 0 but r2 > 0 that supports SI order.
In the
SI phase, the cubic anisotropy locks the vector order
parameter M along one of the eight possible C3v di-
rections [±1,±1,±1]. Consequently, the ordered state
does not support Goldstone modes, and it is described
by an O(3) order parameter with Z8 anisotropy. The
√
low temperature ground state exhibits TSI order with
M = (M/

3) [±1,±1,±1], where

(cid:114)

M =

− r1

, and u1 = u(cid:48)

1 + u(cid:48)(cid:48)
1 .

Due to the eight-fold degeneracy, even within the TSI
phase there can be strong ﬂuctuations of the order pa-
rameter, and one may not immediately observe any true
long range order due to domain formation. By contrast,
a pure AIAO order is stabilized when r2 < 0 but r1 > 0,

with ϕ =(cid:112)−r2/(2u2).

The overall structure of the phase diagram crucially de-
pends on the relative strengths of u1u2 and u2
12. When
u1u2 > u2
12, there is a tetracritical point at T = Tc,1 =
Tc,2, where four lines of second order transitions meet.
Apart from the pure SI and AIAO ordered phases, there
is a coexisting phase with both ϕ (cid:54)= 0 and M (cid:54)= 0, which
corresponds to a generic form 3I1O ordered state. This
situation is illustrated in the phase diagram of Fig. 2(a)
drawn in the temperature vs. interaction strength plane,
and the red dot corresponds to the tetracritical point. On
the other hand, for u1u2 < u2
12 the SI and AIAO orders
cannot coexist, and at low temperatures they are sepa-
rated by a ﬁrst order transition, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
Now a bicritical point (marked by the blue dot) is lo-
cated at T = Tc,1 = Tc,2, where two lines of second order
transition and a line of ﬁrst order transition meet. The
phase diagram shown in Fig. 2(c) captures the parameter
regime m1 > m2 that only supports AIAO order. Next
we consider the eﬀects of the particle-hole anisotropy
(E0(k) (cid:54)= 0) and an underlying Fermi surface (µ (cid:54)= 0)
on the phase diagram.

ever for u1u2 < u2
12 the 3I1O state is separated from the
AIAO phase by a ﬁrst order transition at low tempera-
tures, see Fig. 2(e). In the following section we consider
the eﬀects of external strain and magnetic ﬁeld on the SI
and AIAO phases.

VII. EFFECTS OF STRAIN AND MAGNETIC

FIELD

In this section we elucidate the multipolar nature of
the SI (superposition of T1u dipolar and octupolar ob-
jects) and AIAO (A2u octupolar quantity) orders, and
their interplay with time reversal symmetric nematic or
quadrupolar orders in the presence of applied external
strain and magnetic ﬁelds. We consider their eﬀects sep-
arately in the following two subsections.

A. External strain

In the previous section we have emphasized that the
particle-hole anisotropy leads to a generic form of 3I1O
order, which is a superposition of the TSI and AIAO or-
ders. On the general symmetry ground the coexistence
of these two orders can produce lattice distortion (ne-
maticity), which can be seen in the following way. The
SI and AIAO orders can couple to the T2g quadrupolar
order parameter (Qab) according to
f(cid:48) = v|abc|QabMcϕ, where Qab = |abc|(cid:104)Ψ†ΓcΨ(cid:105). (34)

The constant v can be determined by evaluating the
Feynmann diagram (f) in Fig. 4, and only in the pres-
ence of particle-hole anisotropy it can be nonzero. For
simplicity if we assume E0(k) = 0, m1 = m2 = m but
µ (cid:54)= 0 we obtain a simpliﬁed expression

where µ is the underlying chemical potential, ωn = (2n +

12is valid inside the normal
state and in the immediate vicinity of max{Tc,1, Tc,2}
inside the ordered phase. Thus the free energy density is
modiﬁed according to

12 s ϕ M 3,
(31)
where s = sgn(M1M2M3). Notice that su(cid:48)
12M 3 acts as
an external ﬁeld for ϕ. Therefore, the phase diagram
can support only two phases: (i) a general 3I1O order
comprised of coexisting TSI and AIAO and (ii) a pure
AIAO order.

Notice that M = 0 is always a solution of these equations,
which can describe either the normal phase with ϕ =

0 or a pure AIAO phase with ϕ = ±(cid:112)−r2/(2u2) (see

Fig. 2(c)). The pure AIAO phase is stable when r2 is
suﬃciently negative and satisﬁes |r2| > u2|r1|/u12. Now
we show why the pure TSI ordered phase (when r1 < 0
and r2 > 0 or Tc,2 < T < Tc,1) discussed earlier gets
12 (cid:54)= 0. In this regime but
eliminated in the presence of u(cid:48)
just below Tc,1, we can ignore ϕ3 and u12M 2
ϕ terms in
Eq. (32) and ϕ dependence in Eq. (33). Consequently we
obtain

Therefore, in the parameter regime r1 < 0 and r2 > 0,
a small amplitude of TSI (just below Tc,1) induces a
much smaller AIAO component, and the pure TSI phase
gets converted into a generic 3I1O state. When r2 is
gradually tuned toward a negative value, the strength
of ϕ increases, while M systematically decreases. When
u1u2 > u2
12 there is a second order transition between
3I1O and pure AIAO ordered phases, and three lines of
continuous transitions meet at a multicritical point (no

Since both ϕ and M are nonzero for a generic 3I1O order,
their product (as encoded in f(cid:48)) acts as an external ﬁeld
for the T2g quadrupolar order. This in turn produces an
expectation value for Qab, and a mechanical strain of the
form

exy = eyz = ezx (cid:54)= 0.

In the parameter regime r1 < 0 and r2 > 0, but just
below the transition temperature Tc,1, the induced Qab

will be very small and ∝ M 4. However, if we rather apply
an external T2g strain (along [1,1,1] direction), it couples
linearly T2g order parameter.
In turn the induced T2g
order parameter can cause a quadratic coupling between
TSI and AIAO orders (in contrast to the quartic coupling
∝ u(cid:48)
12). Consequently an external strain can amplify the
3I1O order, making it possible to observe the AHE at
higher temperatures. We can estimate the enhancement
of the transition temperature of 3I1O order in the follow-
ing way. When r2 > 0, r1 < 0 (but close to Tc,1), we can

quantiﬁes the strength of external strain. After substi-
tuting this back in the free energy we ﬁnd the following

when Tc,2 << Tc,1. However, the energy scale of external
strain should be smaller than the transition temperature
of the dominant order say Tc,1. This prediction should
be relevant for experiments on thin ﬁlms of Pr2Ir2O7, as
growth process of thin ﬁlms along [1,1,1] direction natu-
rally introduces T2g strain. Next we consider the role of
externally applied magnetic ﬁeld.

B. External magnetic ﬁeld

In addition to breaking time reversal symmetry, an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld (H) also reduces the cubic symme-
try. Therefore, it can couple diﬀerent types of multipo-
lar order parameters. Since the SI order parameter Ma
is built out of both dipolar and octupolar quantities, it
can directly couple to both Ha and H 3
a. By contrast,
a purely octopular AIAO order can only couple to the
product H1H2H3.
In addition the time reversal sym-
metric products HaHb can couple to rotational symme-
try breaking quadrupolar order parameters Qab. Finally
the third order terms H1(H 2
1 ) and
H3(H 2
2 ) can respectively couple to the time rever-
sal symmetry breaking T2u octupolar order parameters

where gjs are appropriate coupling constants. Conse-
quently, a magnetic ﬁeld along [1,1,1] direction can give
rise to a general form of 3I1O order and T2g nematic-
ity. The important eﬀects of the competing orders can
be seen only when the measurements are performed on

12

Nd2−2xPr2xIr2O7, but either on the metallic side x > 0.8
or in the close proximity of the MIT on the insulating
side. Similarly important eﬀects of competing orders
should be observable in ﬁeld dependent measurements on
Nd2Ir2O7 under hydrostatic pressure when p ∼ pc. When
we are deep inside the AIAO ordered phase, the eﬀects of
competing orders will be minimal and a very strong mag-
netic ﬁeld will be required to induce any metal-insulator
transition.

By contrast, a ﬁeld along [0,0,1] direction (or [1,0,0],
[0,1,0]) couples only to the uniaxial SI order parameter
M3 (or M1, M2) and the Eg quadrupolar order param-
eter Q = (Q11 + Q22 − Q33)/4 = (cid:104)Ψ†J 2
3 Ψ(cid:105) ∝ (cid:104)Ψ†Γ5Ψ(cid:105)
according to

f[001] = [g1HM3 + g2H 3M 3

3 ] + g4H 2Q.

(38)

Therefore, a suﬃciently strong ﬁeld along the [0,0,1] di-
rection can overcome the cubic anisotropy, and lead to
the nucleation of uniaxial SI order18,36, together with Eg
nematicity on the metallic side of the global phase dia-
gram. Since AIAO order does not couple to [0,0,1] ﬁeld
direction, it is easier to suppress the AIAO order for such
a ﬁeld orientation. This latter eﬀect has been clearly
demonstrated through a ﬁeld dependent MIT observed
in Nd2Ir2O7

18,36.

Finally an external ﬁeld along [1,1,0] direction modiﬁes

the free energy through the terms

f[110] =

(cid:1) ,

(39)

Based on such couplings we expect a complicated form
of multipolar order in the presence of suﬃciently strong
magnetic ﬁeld along [1,1,0] direction on the metallic side
of the global phase diagram. However due to the presence
of several competing orders it can be diﬃcult to induce
MIT when we are deep inside insulating phase.
It is
worth pointing out that no MIT has been induced in
18,36 for ﬁeld along [1,1,0] direction. Therefore
Nd2Ir2O7
experiments for this ﬁeld orientation has to be carried
out either on the metallic side or in the close proximity of
the MIT for oberving any signiﬁcant eﬀect. Any further
analysis of the eﬀects of external magnetic ﬁeld is left for
future investigation.

VIII. CONCLUSION

We have considered the competition between itinerant
spin ice and all in-all out orders for a parabolic semimetal
that describes the normal state of Pr2Ir2O7 and possibly
other 227 pyrochlore iridates. We show that a general
form of 3I1O order can arise due to the combined ef-
fects of cubic anisotropy and particle hole asymmetry of
the normal state. The 3I1O order gives rise to a Weyl

2(cid:88)

metal and a large anomalous Hall eﬀect along one of the
eight possible [1,1,1] directions without any large local
Pr magnetic moment. The direction of the magnetic mo-
ment and the underlying net spin chirality due to the
noncoplanar spin arrangements coincide and they point
along one of the [1,1,1] directions. The experimentally
observed direction, size, temperature scale, and the mag-
netic moment can be reconciled with an amplitude of
3I1O order, which gives rise to a small magnetic mo-
ment ∼ 10−5µB. The Weyl metal phase is also expected
to support large anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst ef-
fects. We have also considered the eﬀects of external
strain and magnetic ﬁelds on the 3I1O ordered phase,
and suggested that the AHE eﬀect can be stabilized at
higher temperatures by applying weak, external strain
along [1,1,1] direction (T2g strain). This is a concrete
experimentally veriﬁable (or falsiﬁable) prediction of our
theory.

Our phase diagrams in Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(b), Fig. 2(d)
and Fig. 2(e) suggest an intriguing possibility of quantum
phase transitions between a paramagnetic semimetal (or
metal) and an itinerant 3I1O ordered phase. Through a
possible replacement of Pr by larger Ce or La ions such
a QPT may become accessible.
In the presence of an
underlying Fermi surface (Fig. 2(d) and Fig. 2(e)) the
system will most probably exhibit a weak, ﬂuctuation
driven ﬁrst order QPT51. However, one can still observe
quantum critical behavior at higher temperatures. Given
that the Fermi level in this material is extremely close
to the quadratic band touching point, we can gain in-
sight by considering a simpler problem without a Fermi
surface. In the absence of a Fermi surface, the large N
mean ﬁeld theory and renormalization group calculations
suggest a continuous QPT, and the corresponding quan-
tum critical point (QCP) displays non-Gaussian critical
properties. Within a one loop renormalization group cal-
culation, anchored by the large N limit (saddle point),
correlation length and dynamic scaling exponents charac-
terizing the QCP are respectively found to be ν = 1 and
z = 2. However, these exponents do receive corrections
at higher orders and we leave this issue for future studies.
At the quantum critical point, the notion of the well de-
ﬁned quasiparticle pole (of parabolic and Weyl semimet-
als) breaks down, giving rise to non-Fermi liquid behav-
ior. At the itinerant QCP, the gapless fermionic degrees
of freedom are strongly coupled to the gapless bosonic
collective modes (or order parameter ﬁelds). The non-
Fermi liquid nature at the QCP is characterized by the
branch cut in the spectral function.The critical property
of a physical observable (O) (thermodynamic or trans-
port quantity) will generally exhibit a scaling form

O = δxνF(cid:0)εδ−νz(cid:1) ,

(40)
where F is a universal scaling function, the exponent
x describes the anomalous dimension of the observable,
δ = (g − gc)/gc is the reduced distance of the tuning pa-
rameter or the coupling constant from the QCP located
at g = gc, and ε corresponds to either temperature or fre-

13

quency (ω). For example, inside the parabolic and Weyl
semimetals the speciﬁc heat (Cv) respectively behaves
T 3/2 and T 3, while inside the critical fan Cv ∼ T 3/z. On
the other hand, the variations of frequency (temperature)
dependent conductivity in these three regions are re-

So far we have considered a mean ﬁeld description of
the SI and AIAO orders. At best we have alluded to
ﬂuctuation eﬀects that can be treated within a pertur-
bative framework. How can we reconcile such a descrip-
tion with the known classical spin liquid behavior of SI
and the possibility of a chiral spin liquid? The topo-
logical defects of order parameter ﬁelds can play an es-
sential role toward the formation of a possible spin liq-
uid phase. We expect the eight fold degenerate 3I1O
conﬁgurations (on a tetrahedron) to cause strong ther-
mal and quantum ﬂuctuations. The ﬂuctuation eﬀects
on SI manifold (within just the order parameter sector)
can be captured by an O(3) nonlinear sigma model for
Ω = M/|M| augmented by periodic terms reﬂecting the
Z8 cubic anisotropy. Within such description, a disor-
dered phase can exist at ﬁnite temperatures, which is
characterized by vanishing spin stiﬀness for Ω.
In the
absence of stiﬀness, we expect hedgehog singularities of
O(3) model, which will act as monopole excitations. Our
Landau theory for competing SI and AIAO orders sug-
gest that the monopole excitations will be strongly cou-
pled to the AIAO order parameter ﬁeld ϕ. Therefore,
the interplay between SI and AIAO orders can be de-
scribed by an O(4) model with anisotropies that lower
the symmetry to O(3) × Z2. Within such a theory the
monopoles correspond to the smooth SO(4) textures,
N = (cos f (r), sin f (r) ˆr). Even rudimentary descrip-
tions of the interaction between monopoles and itiner-
ant fermions, the resulting fate of the Weyl quasipar-
ticles (obtained at mean-ﬁeld level), and nature of the
putative QCP are incredibly challenging open problems
well beyond the scope of the current work. We have,
however, developed a fairly complete phenomenological
Landau theory describing the generic phase diagrams of
227 pyrochlore iridates, arguing that many of the ob-
served anomalous properties of Pr2Ir2O7 can be under-
stood from an underlying “3-in-1-out” itinerant magnetic
order and Weyl nodes without invoking any large local
magnetic moment and associated Kondo physics.

Appendix A: Derivation of Luttinger Hamiltonian

14

We ﬁrst outline the methodology for projecting out the higher energy bands for obtaining low energy Luttinger
Hamiltonian for noninteracting electrons. In the momentum space the tight-binding Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) can be
compactly written by using 8 × 8 SU (8) generators, obtained by taking direct products of 2 × 2 Pauli matrices σµ
(operating on spin indices) and 4 × 4 SU (4) generators ˆλjs (operating on orbital indices). After projecting out two
fold degenerate conduction bands, the model can be written in term of 6× 6 SU (6) generators, found by taking direct
products of 2 × 2 Pauli matrices σµ and 3 × 3 SU (3) generators ˆtjs. After accounting for spin-orbit splitting we will
arrive at the subspace of quadratically touching bands, where the eﬀective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of
4 × 4 SU (4) generators or Dirac matrices.

The spin independent and spin dependent parts of the tight-binding model respectively become

Therefore, we conclude that M1 and M2 components of the SI order parameter couple to the quadratically touching
bands according to M1Ψ†Γ23Ψ ≡ M1Ψ†Γ1Γ45Ψ and M2Ψ†Γ31Ψ ≡ M1Ψ†Γ2Γ45Ψ respectively (after roating with ˜U ).
By comparing with Eq. (A14) and Eq. (A15) we conclude that SI order parameter is a particular admixture of dipolar
and octupolar quantities following T1u representation.

3-in 1-out: A superposition of AIAO and SI order parameters can be captured through Ψ†[ϕ Γ45 +(cid:80)3

and it corresponds to a general form of 3I1O order. For concreteness we can consider a conventional 3I1O conﬁguration
that couples with underlying fermions according to M1 χ† ˆN1χ where the 8 × 8 matrix

Ferromagnetism: The conventional ferromagnetic order couples with the underlying 8-component fermions accord-
ing to N · χ†σ ⊗ 14×4χ. Since conventional ferromagnetism corresponds to dipolar ordering, we expect it to couple
√
to four component parabolic fermions according to N · Ψ†JΨ. We demonstrate this for N = N0 [1, 1, 1]/
