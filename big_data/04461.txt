ABSTRACT
We present observations of rapid (sub-second) optical ﬂux variability in V404 Cyg during
its 2015 June outburst. Simultaneous three-band observations with the ULTRACAM fast im-
ager on four nights show steep power spectra dominated by slow variations on ∼ 100–1000 s
timescales. Near the peak of the outburst on June 26, a dramatic change occurs and additional,
persistent sub-second optical ﬂaring appears close in time to giant radio and X-ray ﬂaring. The
ﬂares reach peak optical luminosities of ∼ few × 1036 erg s−1. Some are unresolved down
to a time resolution of 24 milliseconds. Whereas the fast ﬂares are stronger in the red, the
slow variations are bluer when brighter. The redder slopes, emitted power, and characteristic
timescales of the fast ﬂares can be explained as optically-thin synchrotron emission from a
compact jet arising on size scales ∼140–500 Gravitational radii (with a possible additional
contribution by a thermal particle distribution). The origin of the slower variations is unclear.
The optical continuum spectral slopes are strongly affected by dereddening uncertainties and
contamination by strong Hα emission, but the variations of these slopes follow relatively sta-
ble loci as a function of ﬂux. Cross-correlating the slow variations between the different bands
shows asymmetries on all nights consistent with a small red skew (i.e., red lag). X-ray repro-
cessing and non-thermal emission could both contribute to these. These data reveal a complex
mix of components over ﬁve decades in timescale during the outburst.

1 INTRODUCTION
ˇ404 is an X-ray binary (XRB) hosting a black hole (BH) with
mass in the range MBH = 8–15 M⊙ (e.g. Khargharia et al. 2010;
Casares & Jonker 2014, and references therein). It came to great
prominence in 1989 as the X-ray nova GS 2023+338 (Makino
1989). Thereafter, it was found to be associated with prior optical
nova eruptions of the source ˇ404 in 1938 and 1956 (e.g. Richter
1989), suggesting repeated long-term outbursts. In June 2015, the
source underwent a brief but proliﬁc outburst, during which it
reached peak brightness levels amongst the brightest in the X-ray
sky, with luminosities rivalling the Eddington value during ﬂares
(Ferrigno et al. 2015; Rodriguez et al. 2015). Its brightness makes
this outburst an excellent laboratory for studying massive accretion
episodes on to black hole XRBs in detail.

Multiwavelength variability can provide important clues
to the physical origin of emission in XRB outbursts. Sev-
eral studies in recent years have pointed out
that rapid mul-
tiwavelength timing observations can break degeneracies be-
tween emission models comprising the accretion disc, the in-
ner hot ﬂow, and the base of the jet (e.g. Kanbach et al.
2001; Uemura et al. 2002; Hynes et al. 2003; Durant et al. 2008;
Gandhi et al. 2010; Casella et al. 2010; Veledina et al. 2011;
Malzac 2014; Drappeau et al. 2015; Uttley & Casella 2014, and
references therein). Yet, the number of black hole XRBs with de-
tections of sub-second variability remains just a few.

The June 2015 outburst of ˇ404 was also accompanied by spec-
tacular multiwavelength variability across the entire electromag-
netic spectrum. The fastest characteristic variability timescales re-
ported so far at any wavelength other than X-rays go down to ∼1 s
(Hynes et al. 2015a; Terndrup et al. 2015, both in the optical). Al-
though faster observations have been carried out, there has been no
report of the detection of signiﬁcant sub-second ﬂaring so far (cf.,
Gandhi et al. 2015a).

In this paper, we present rapid, sub-second imaging obser-
vations of ˇ404 carried out with the ULTRACAM fast imager
(Dhillon et al. 2007) mounted on the 4.2 m William Herschel Tele-
scope (WHT) in La Palma. The data were obtained over four nights
and lead up to the night of 2015 June 25 (2015 June 26 UT) when
the source showed particularly intense radio and X-ray ﬂaring ac-
tivity. We ﬁnd persistent sub-second optical ﬂaring activity on this
night, and contrast this with the preceding nights which were dom-
inated mainly by slower variations with characteristic timescales
of several hundred seconds and longer. This paper places some ﬁrst
constraints on the optical emission processes of the fast ﬂares using
timing and spectral analyses, together with qualitative discussion of
the slow variations. More detailed investigations will be presented
in follow-up works.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Fast optical timing with ULTRACAM/WHT

The observations were carried out over several nights during the
week of 2015 June 19–26, for durations ranging from ∼20 min
to 1.5 hr. Observations on four nights were obtained under clear
skies at low airmass (6 1.1), with photometry being carried out si-
multaneously in the u′, g′ and r′ bands. The observation log for
these nights is presented in Table 1. Other than one night that was
pre-scheduled and coordinated with X-ray observations with the
Swiftsatellite, all observations were carried out on a best-effort ba-
sis during gaps in the normal ULTRACAM observing programme,

sometimes extending into morning twilight in order to maximise
the duration of the observing window. A few additional short ob-
servations were carried out either under worse weather conditions
or in non-standard ﬁlters, and are not analysed herein.

ULTRACAM was used in its fastest ‘drift’ mode, except
on the ﬁrst night when ‘one-pair’ mode was employed. These
modes allow fast, simultaneous photometry within small CCD win-
dows centred on the target and a ﬁeld comparison star within
a few arcmin of V404 Cyg. The window sizes were typically
∼ 50 × 50 pixels. Cycle times depend upon window size and CCD
binning, and range from 78 ms down to 24.1 ms. Dead time was
small for most of the observations which were carried out in drift
mode (≈ 1.1 ms), and is ignored in our analysis here. For the ﬁrst
observation in one-pair mode, dead time is higher (≈ 24 ms) and
constitutes 30 % of the cycle time. Its impact is noted where rele-
vant (speciﬁcally for the power spectra that we will present later).
The ﬁeld star was used to monitor seeing and transparency
variations. But ˇ404 in outburst was brighter than all stars in the
ULTRACAM ﬁeld of view, especially in the redder r′ and g′ ﬁlters
where we have the fastest sampling, so the ﬁeld star is not used for
relative photometry. The u′ band is less sensitive than the other two,
and coadding of frames is employed to provide a gain in signal-
to-noise (S/N). The coadding is performed on-chip, and individual
coadded frames are not saved. On the ﬁrst night, 6 frames were
coadded, and the other nights employed 15 coadds in u′, resulting
in correspondingly lower time resolution.

Data reduction was carried out with the ULTRACAM pipeline
v.9.14 (Dhillon et al. 2007). All frames were bias-subtracted and
ﬂat-ﬁelded. Source photometry was carried out in large circu-
lar apertures (7–14 arcsec diameter) with variable centre positions
tracking the centroid of the source on each frame. The seeing was
typically between 1–2 arcsec during the observations. Sky back-
ground was measured as the clipped mean in an annular aperture.
Photometric errors include Poisson noise and read noise. Pho-
tometric calibration was not the focus of these observations, whose
purpose was to search for optical variability. However, the nights
were clear and an approximate ﬂux calibration was possible us-
ing zeropoints based upon photometric standard stars measured on
some of the nights. The scatter between the nights is ≈ 0.04, 0.005
and 0.01 mag, respectively, in u′, g′ and r′. Photometric calibration
systematic uncertainties and tests are described in the Appendix.
However, note that it is the systematic uncertainties related to the
large line-of-sight reddening that dominate measurements of the
intrinsic shape of the optical spectral energy distribution (SED), as
we will discuss later.

2.2 Optical spectroscopy with BOOTES

Broadband ﬁlters are used in ULTRACAM, with wavelength cov-
erage including contributions from emission lines in addition to the
spectral continuum. The most prominent optical emission line in
the case of V404 Cyg is Hα, which falls in the r′ band. In order
to estimate the relative ﬂux contribution of Hα, we utilised optical
spectroscopic data from BOOTES–2/COLORES. As we will dis-
cuss later, the emission line strength relative to continuum is known
to be strongly variable, so only (quasi)simultaneous data are appro-
priate for such estimates.

BOOTES (acronym of the Burst Observer and Optical Tran-
sient Exploring System) is a world-wide network of robotic
telescopes (Castro-Tirado et al. 1999, 2012), with telescopes lo-
cated in Spain (BOOTES–1, BOOTES–2 and BOOTES–IR), New
Zealand (BOOTES–3) and China (BOOTES–4). Currently, one op-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–20

tical spectrograph is operational in the BOOTES network. This
is COLORES, mounted on the 0.6 m diameter BOOTES–2 tele-
scope. COLORES stands for Compact Low Resolution Spectro-
graph (Rabaza et al. 2014). It is sensitive over the wavelength range
of 3800–11500 ˚A and has a spectral resolution of 15–60 ˚A. The pri-
mary scientiﬁc target of the spectrograph is prompt follow-up of
Gamma Ray Bursts, but it is also used to study optical transients.

BOOTES–2/COLORES observed V404 Cyg on several nights
during the 2015 outburst for 300 s of integration each time
(Caballero-Garcia et al. 2015). Data were reduced using standard
procedures and wavelength-calibrated using arc lamps. The high-
est S/N spectrum was obtained on June 26, starting at UT03:45:13.
This is just over 1 h before the ULTRACAM observations on this
night (Table 1). It is important to note that the spectra are not ﬂux
calibrated, so estimation of the relative strength of Hα can only be
made by modelling the continuum.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Light curves from all nights
The source light curves are shown in Fig. 1. ˇ404 is signiﬁcantly
detected in all bands and on all nights, with count rates varying by
about a factor of 5 in each band across all observations. The source
count rates were found to be high in all cases, exceeding 103 cts s−1
in u′ and 105 cts s−1 in the other two bands. The S/N of the source
is above ≈ 100 per frame in all r′ light curves. The S/N in g′ and
u′ dips as low as ≈ 10 during some of the faintest short periods, but
is typically higher by a factor of a few, at least.

Strong and smooth variations on characteristic timescales of
∼ tens of minutes are present on all nights. We generically refer to
these as the ‘slow variations’ hereafter. Some qualitative changes
are visible between the ﬁrst three nights, with the data on June 21
(here and hereafter, the night of observation is referred to in UTC)
showing a quasi-regular oscillatory pattern on timescales of a few
minutes which are absent on the other nights. The most striking
change, however, occurs on the last night of June 26. In addition to
the slow variations, the light curve on this night is crowded with
short, spiky ﬂares (hereafter, ‘fast ﬂares’ or ‘sub-second ﬂares’) for
the entire duration of about 1200 s. By contrast, the ﬁrst two nights
show no such sharp ﬂares, while the third night (June 25) shows
only a few, isolated periods of ﬂaring, discussed later.

Fig. 2 enlarges the ﬂux-calibrated June 26 lightcurves from all
three bands for clearer comparison. After an initial observation
385.2 s in length (hereafter, epoch 1) on this night showed the pres-
ence of obvious fast ﬂaring activity, the observation was paused,
sped up, and continued for a further duration of 788.6 s (epoch 2).
The g′–r′ colour evolution is also plotted. The slow variations are
seen to have stronger peak-to-peak variability in the bluer ﬁlters.
This is apparent from the fact that the colour is bluer (smaller g′–
r′) when the source is brighter, and redder when fainter. In fact, this
is true for all nights of data, as we will discuss later.1

In contrast to the stronger blue variability of the slow varia-
tions, the ﬁgure clearly shows that the fast ﬂaring is stronger in r′
than in g′. This is apparent from strength of the r′ ﬂares in the
main panel, and the momentary reddening (g′–r′ colour spikes)
at the times of the fast ﬂares in the middle panel. We remind the
reader that the u′ band has an intrinsic time resolution 15 times

lower than the other bands on this night, so is unsuitable for com-
parisons on the fastest timescales. We will analyse the properties of
the fast ﬂares and colour trends in more detail shortly. We also refer
the reader to the supplementary Appendix Fig. A2 which illustrates
this further.

It is worth noting that the sub-second ﬂaring is clearly much
stronger than atmospheric scintillation noise, whose magnitude can
be gauged from the simultaneously-observed comparison star light
curve in the same ﬁgure. The comparison star shows a fractional
r.m.s. (Fvar; Vaughan et al. 2003) of 0.010–0.016 across the bands.
This r.m.s. will include contributions from both Poisson and scintil-
lation noise. Fvar for the source is much stronger, at 0.075–0.096,
over the entire light curve, i.e. over the full Fourier frequency range
(see following sub-section).

3.2 Power spectra

Fig. 3 shows the power spectral densities (PSDs) in rms-normalised
νPν (Frequency × Power) units. The PSDs for the observations on
all nights are compared on an identical scale. PSDs were computed
over long sections of 4096 s for the ﬁrst three nights, and shorter
sections of 256 s and 512 s respectively for epochs 1 and 2 on the
last night, according to the length of the observations. The PSDs
were corrected for constant white noise at high Fourier frequen-
cies using standard formalisms (Vaughan et al. 2003). In addition to
photometric measurement noise, scintillation noise becomes non-
negligible at high Fourier frequencies for ground-based observa-
tions. Osborn et al. (2015) provide estimates of the magnitude of
scintillation noise for the La Palma site, and we used their Eq. 7
to add in this noise component in quadrature for the computation
for white noise. However, the estimates of Osborn et al. are based
upon median atmospheric turbulence proﬁles, so may overestimate
the true white noise component in case of low turbulence. For cases
where the estimated white noise level exceeded the measured PSD
at high Fourier frequencies, we instead used a constant to model the
PSD level at the three highest frequencies and used this as a mea-
sure of the white noise. Finally, a logarithmic frequency binning
was applied.

The ﬁgure shows steeply falling PSDs over the ﬁrst three
nights. Fitting a simple power law model Pν ∝ ν β to these PSDs,
we ﬁnd typically slopes β ranging from ≈ –1.6 to –2 below ∼ 1 Hz.
At the lowest Fourier frequencies ∼< 0.01 Hz, the PSD bends into
an even steeper component. This second component appears espe-
cially prominent on the second night of June 21, when it levels off
on timescales of ∼ 500 s and is likely associated with the repeated
oscillatory behaviour visible in the lightcurve in Fig. 1. In all these
cases, power increases by a small factor in the bluer bands (typ-
ically 1.3 in g′ and 1.7 in u′, respectively, relative to r′). These
are again a reﬂection of the stronger peak-to-peak slow variabil-
ity in the bluer bands apparent in the light curves and highlighted
in the previous section. The effect of dead time is to increase the
noise ﬂoor and alias power towards low Fourier frequencies be-
cause some of the high frequency power is not directly sampled.
This would affect mainly the ﬁrst night of data (obtained in ‘one-
pair mode’; see Observations section) when dead time is signif-
icant. Despite this effect, the behaviour of the PSDs on this night
appears very similar to the other nights. Moreover, a steep red noise
optical PSD has also been reported during the present V404 Cyg
outburst by Hynes et al. (2015b) and Wiersema (2015). Detailed
investigations of these PSDs sampling the slow variations will be
presented in later work.

Here, we focus on the PSDs from the last night of June 26

of observation were separated by a short gap. The light curves have been offset slightly for clarity. This ﬁgure clearly shows the high density of fast ﬂaring
activity, which is strongest in r′, followed by g′. The Top panel shows the comparison star light curve (only r′ is shown for clarity); its small scatter (1.11%
around mean) demonstrates the stability of observing conditions. The middle panel shows the source colour for the g′ and r′ bands which have the highest time
resolution. We remind the reader that the u′ light curve has lower time resolution by a factor of 15 than the other two bands, so is not suitable for comparing
the fast ﬂares with the other bands. Comparing the middle and bottom panels, the slow variations are seen to be bluer (smaller g′–r′ colour) when the source
is brighter, and vice-versa. The instants of the fast ﬂaring are also associated with momentary reddening.

which shows fast ﬂaring activity. The PSDs in the bottom panels
of Fig. 3 show a striking difference with respect to the previous
PSDs, in that they now display a strong and broad hump at the high-
est Fourier frequencies, extending over ∼ 0.1–10 Hz. This hump is
completely absent on the other nights, and the peak power in the
hump is about 100–200 times higher than the power seen during
the previous nights at ∼ 1 Hz. Furthermore, it is now the redder
bands that carry more power above ∼0.05 Hz. At lower frequen-
cies, there is a changeover to the bluer bands dominating the slow
variations – a behaviour that is similar to the previous nights. This
changeover is best visible for the second epoch, where the light
curve duration is longer. This also has ﬁner sampling, allowing the
PSD to be generated over a broad range from 0.002 Hz up to the
Nyquist frequency of ≈ 20 Hz. A steep up-turn is apparent below
the hump around a frequency of 0.01 Hz. We found that when ﬁt-
ting the hump with a Lorentzian component, the lower frequency
part of the PSD required two power laws to describe. In Table 2,
we show the parameters for a double power law plus zeroth order
Lorentzian ﬁt to the g′ and r′ data for this epoch. One of the power
laws is found to be very steep. We caution, however, that the rela-
tively short duration of our light curve does not allow us to model
the low frequencies well, and our model should only be taken as
a parametrization of the PSD shape. The u′ light curve was slower
and the PSD has lower S/N, but it qualitatively obeys the same trend
as g′ and r′.

By integrating the rms-normalised PSD over any given fre-
quency range, the fractional variance of the light curve over that
range can be determined. For the sub-second variability which is
the focus of our work here, the fractional r.m.s. over 1–20 Hz for
the fastest June 26 epoch 2 light curve constitutes 20 % and 12 %
of the total fractional r.m.s. in r′ and g′ reported at the end of § 3.1,
respectively.

3.3 Fast ﬂares

We next investigated the properties of the fast ﬂaring behaviour on
June 26 in more detail. The high density of ﬂaring makes it difﬁcult
to see the ﬂares clearly in Fig. 2. So in Fig. 4, we present zoom-
in plots for the epoch 2 r′ light curve, concentrating on this band
because it is the light curve with the strongest and fastest ﬂaring.

The PSDs for the same data set (Fig. 3) show that ﬂaring on
a range of short timescales ∼< 10 s manifests as a broad continuum
hump in the frequency domain above ∼ 0.1 Hz. Here, we examine
the properties of these fast ﬂares in the time domain. We started
by detrending the light curve in order to normalise out the slow
variations. This was done by using a running 20 s clipped mean to
deﬁne the local continuum count rate at every time bin, and then
dividing by this continuum count rate to create a normalised light
curve. A ﬂare was then deﬁned as one showing at least a 10 σ ﬂuc-
tuation in the normalised count rate light curve, where σ here refers
to the background scatter introduced by atmospheric scintillation,
measured in the comparison star light curve. A selected ﬂare was
also required to be the brightest point within a contiguous inter-
val of 10 s (∆t = ± 5 s around the peak). This was done in order
to select unique ﬂares only and avoid double-counting in case of
complex ﬂare proﬁles. The choice of 10 s as the interval was mo-
tivated by the lower frequency threshold of ∼ 0.1 Hz above which
the Lorentzian hump dominates the PSDs.

We found 74 ﬂares using the above criteria, with a mean ﬂare
peak strength of 23 % above the continuum count rate, and with an
average time interval between ﬂares of 10.6 s. The brightest ﬂare
occurred 369.97 s after start and showed a peak strength ≈ 78%

in count rate (or 0.63 in mag). The lower zoomed panel in Fig. 4
shows this ﬂare in close detail, together with other nearby features.
At half maximum height, the full width of this ﬂare is ≈ 70 ms.
Most ﬂares, including this one, show complex proﬁles with a broad
base and/or multiple neighbouring sub-ﬂares around a narrow core.
We select the 10 brightest ﬂares (highlighted in the central panel of
Fig. 4) for characterisation. Fitting a Gaussian to the mean proﬁle,
we ﬁnd a narrow core with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of 345 (± 1) ms. But as the PSD shows, there is signiﬁcant ﬂaring
on timescales even shorter than this. For instance, choosing ∆t = 1
s (i.e. a contiguous interval of 2 s for unique ﬂare selection), we
ﬁnd 172 ﬂares with a time interval between ﬂares of 4.6 s. Given
the complex ﬂare proﬁles, even higher ﬂare rates can be inferred
by using other methods to deﬁne and count ﬂares. So the brightest
selected ﬂares do not necessarily tell us about the fastest ﬂaring
activity.

We investigated this further by selecting ﬂares that are dom-
inated by an unresolved narrow core. This was done by requiring
that the central single 24 ms time bin at ﬂare peak be at least a factor
of 2 higher (above the continuum count rate) than its immediately
adjacent bins on either side, in addition to being the brightest point
within ± 1 s. Twelve such ﬂares were found, and are plotted aligned
to their peaks and superposed in Fig. 5. The proﬁles are again com-
plex, with sub-ﬂares visible even within ± 1 s. But the mean proﬁle
clearly shows an unresolved peak dominating above a broad base.
This mean proﬁle peaks 17 % above continuum. So there are at least
some ﬂares with cores apparently narrower than 24 ms.

Finally, we highlight two short periods of signiﬁcant sub-
second ﬂaring which occurred on the preceding night of June 25.
These are presented in Fig. 6. These ﬂaring episodes are concen-
trated within ∼ 30–40 s and are remarkable in their sudden appear-

ance and disappearance in the otherwise smooth light curve domi-
nated by the slow variations. We examined the relative strengths of
these ﬂares between the bands, and found that they show stronger
ﬂaring in r′ than in g′, very similar to the fast persistent ﬂaring on
the ﬁnal nights. No such episodes were detected during the obser-
vations on our ﬁrst two nights (June 20 and 21).

3.4 Spectral indices of the fast ﬂares and the slow variations

In sections 3.1 and 3.2, we found that the fast ﬂares are stronger in
the red than the slower variations. An examination by eye of the
strongest ﬂares in Fig. 2 shows that they momentarily redden the
source colour by up to ∆(g′–r′) ≈ 0.1 mag. Here, we quantify the
evolution of the source colour in more detail.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–20

Fig. 7 shows the g′–r′ colour vs. source brightness for every
time bin during the second epoch on Jun 26. There are two clear
regimes visible. The majority of points follow a locus extending di-
agonally upwards to the left, showing a bluer (smaller) colour when
the source increases in brightness. But above this locus, the trend
is reversed, with the source becoming redder (larger g′–r′ colour)
at the instants when it is brightest. These two regimes represent the
slow variations and the fast ﬂares, respectively. The colour changes
by ≈ 0.1 mag in both regimes. Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
to compare the colour distribution of the 10 brightest, unique ﬂares
selected in the previous section with the colours of all the remain-
ing time bins yields a null hypothesis probability of 2 × 10−7, i.e.
the two distributions differ signiﬁcantly.

CAM optical SED of the slow variations and of the fast ﬂares.
The former was constructed by binning all lightcurves to ≈ 1 s.2
This effectively smooths over much of the fastest ﬂaring, leaving
slower light curves dominated by the longer variations. Observed
magnitudes were dereddened assuming AV = 4 mag (Casares et al.
1993; Hynes et al. 2009) and a standard Galactic reddening law
(Cardelli et al. 1989), resulting in u′g′r′ SEDs for each time bin
in the slow (binned) data, whose mean is shown in the ﬁgure. The
fast (unbinned) g′r′ light curves were similarly dereddened and the
total SEDs at the times of the 10 brightest ﬂares extracted. The
mean SED of these ﬂares is also shown in the ﬁgure in red.

The SEDs of both components are found to be rising towards
the red between g′ and r′, with the SED for ﬂares rising more
steeply than the slower variations. Between g′ and u′, the slope
reverse and rises towards the blue for the slow variations. The SED
slopes were quantiﬁed with spectral indices α, deﬁned as Fν ∝ ν α
and measured between the central frequencies of two ﬁlters. For the
mean of the slow variations, we ﬁnd αgr
slow = –0.45 ± 0.09 between
g′ and r′, and αug
slow = +0.37 ± 0.11 between u′ and g′. The quoted
error here is the standard deviation scatter over all time bins. In con-
trast, at the times of the fast ﬂares, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly steeper
mean slope with αgr

fast = –0.68 ± 0.09.

It is important to note that these spectral indices can be
strongly affected by systematic uncertainties on the reddening. A
10% (0.4 mag) error on AV can change the spectral slopes greatly,
as shown in Fig. 7. However, this does not affect the fact that the
fast ﬂares are redder than the slow variations.

The total SED at the times of the fast ﬂares will also include
the contribution from the underlying slow variations, because the
light curves appear to show that the two components are additive.
Therefore, subtracting the total SED at the times of the fast ﬂares
from that of the slow variations would yield an estimate of the un-
derlying variable power law (PL) associated with red ﬂaring activ-
ity, for which we ﬁnd a median αgr
ﬂares = –1.26 with a standard devi-
ation of 0.38. The 10% uncertainty on AV introduces a systematic
uncertainty of 0.50 to this power law.

3.5 Cross-correlating the optical bands

A cursory examination of Fig. 1 shows that the slow variations in all
three optical bands are broadly similar. In addition, the sub-second
ﬂaring appears to occur fully simultaneously in both g′ and r′, as
seen in the superposed light curves from June 26 in Fig. 2. In order
to check for any subtle inter-band lags, we computed the cross-
correlation functions (CCFs) between pairs of light curves on each
night.

We began with the June 26 CCF between the full resolution g′
and r′ light curves. The procedure for CCF measurement has been
described in Gandhi et al. (2010). Since the g′ and r′ light curves
have identical sampling, we simply choose a maximum time delay
(τmax) that we are interested in investigating, and compute the CCF
for all time delays spanning the range of –τmax to +τmax. Uncer-
tainties can be computed by dividing the full light curve into inde-
pendent sections of length 2 × τmax and computing the CCF scatter
between the sections. Since Poisson noise is relatively small, we do
not correct for it here. We checked the CCFs with two methods –
by interpolating the light curves to a regularly sampled grid before

cross correlating, and also by use of the discrete correlation func-
tion (Edelson & Krolik 1988).

The result in shown in Fig. 8 for epochs 1 and 2 for time delays
relevant for the fast ﬂaring activity (in this case, we used τmax = 5 s,
and then zoomed in to the peak for display). The CCFs are largely
symmetric and show a peak strength well over 0.8 at a peak time
delay of 0 s. In other words, there is strong correlation between the
bands, and no obvious systematic time delay, as is also apparent for
the fast ﬂares from the light curves in Fig. 2.

We next focused on the correlations on longer timescales. In
this case, we also include the u′ data which has slower sampling.
We rebinned the u′g′r′ light curves on all nights to a ≈ 1 s sampling
(in multiples of the u′ intrinsic time resolution). We found that, as
we investigated longer and longer sections by increasing τmax, an
interesting asymmetry began to appear prominently, with the CCF
skewed towards positive redder band time lags on all nights. How-
ever, our ﬁnite light curve durations are not long enough to inves-
tigate very long separate sections independently. As an approxima-
tion, one can compute the CCF using the entire light curve duration
(duration = 2 × τmax), as long as one keeps in mind this caveat. In
this case, we have no associated uncertainties for independent sec-
tions.

In Fig. 9, we show these CCFs computed using the full light
curve durations separately for each night. Results are shown for
both the g′ vs. u′ CCFs and the r′ vs. u′ CCFs, zoomed in around
the peak. Again, the CCFs are strongly correlated. The peaks are
clearly much broader than the CCF relevant for the fast ﬂares in
Fig. 8, as we are focusing here on the longer timescales, which are
dominated by the slow variations on these nights.

But all CCFs also show the aforementioned skew towards pos-
itive lags.3 The skew in the r′ CCFs is larger than for g′. A red
skew is indicative of the presence of red lags for the slow vari-
ations (with respect to the bluer photons). In fact, the CCFs on
June 20 peak around lags of ≈ +6 s (r′ vs. u′) and ≈ +3 s (g′ vs.
u′), and on June 21, at ≈ +1 s (r′ vs. u′). Examining various sec-
tions of the light curve individually, we indeed found evidence for
changing CCF lag strengths between sections.

But the CCF lags and shapes also appear to change between
the nights (although the red skew is present in all). This is likely
a reﬂection of non-stationary behaviour of the light curves, which
manifests as the CCF changes. It is clear from Fig. 1 that the slow
variations do show nightly changes, but our light curve durations
do not fully sample these. This evolution needs to be investigated in
detail. This is best done in Fourier space by computing the Fourier
lags and coherence, and by including other long-term optical moni-
toring data gathered during this outburst, which we leave for future
work. We note in passing that a similar skew towards positive time
delays for the redder bands has also been observed in V404 Cyg
during quiescence (Shahbaz et al. 2003).

3.6 Optical spectroscopy

The BOOTES-2/COLORES optical spectrum is shown in Fig. 10.
Strong and single peaked Hα line in emission is the strongest
feature. Hβ appears weaker but is signiﬁcant. He I (5876 ˚A and
6678 ˚A) lines are also observed, in addition to an emission line at
≈ 7100 ˚A that might correspond to He I 7065 ˚A.

2 More precisely, the binning factor was the closest integer multiple of the
u′ time resolution to 1 s which, for this night, is 1.083 s

3 This red skew due to the slow variations also contributes weakly on
June 26, and is faintly visible in Fig. 8, although the CCF in this case is
dominated by the fast ﬂaring.

Figure 9. g′ vs. u′ and r′ vs. u′ CCFs for the nights dominated by the slow variations, computed from light curves binned to 1 s. In this case, the entire light
curve was used for computing the CCFs, and no averaging performed. The panels are zoomed in on the peaks, separately for each night. The lag on the x-axis
is with respect to the u′ in all panels, with a positive value implying a lag of the redder photon with respect to u′.

The equivalent width (EW) of the most prominent Hα
line was measured by ﬁtting a Gaussian line and continuum
model over the wavelength range of 6450–6640 ˚A, and we ﬁnd
EW = 107.9 ± 9.3 ˚A.

In order to estimate the contribution of the line to our r′ pho-
tometry, the spectrum needs to be convolved with the SDSS ﬁl-
ter response. Since our spectrum is not ﬂux calibrated, we mod-
elled the continuum under two extreme assumptions encompassing
a broad range of possible spectral slopes: α = +2 for a blue rising
continuum, and α = –2 for a red continuum (with α being the con-
tinuum slope as before). The modelled continuum is normalised to
that in the observed spectrum at 6563 ˚A, so that the relative strength
of the emission line is preserved at its central wavelength.

We then estimated the emission line contribution by convolv-
ing these spectra with the SDSS ﬁlter response, both with and with-
out the addition of our ﬁtted Gaussian emission line to the model.
The result is that Hα contributes between 8–11 % to the r′ photom-
etry. The magnitude and direction corresponding to a correction of
11 % are illustrated by the grey arrow in the right-hand panel of
Fig. 7.

On this night, we only have a single observation in Hα.
Follow-up observations on the night of June 29 showed variations
in EW(Hα) by factors of ≈ 2 on timescales of tens of minutes
(Caballero-Garcia et al. 2015). So the correction could potentially
be even larger, though it is worth noting that the source was already
signiﬁcantly in decline on June 29 and displaying different charac-
teristics to outburst peak.

4 DISCUSSION

What can we learn about the origin of the source variability dur-
ing the 2015 outburst from the high temporal resolution optical
lightcurves?

Firstly, the source shows strong ﬂuctuations in all bands and
on a variety of timescales. There are at least two components to
the overall variability: 1) relatively slow and smooth variations
with PSD rising steeply towards low Fourier frequencies, and 2)
fast sub-second ﬂaring. Both the Fourier power and spectral colour

of these components changes over the course of the outburst. The
slow variations appear to be present on all nights (Fig. 1). The sub-
second ﬂaring is persistent only on the last night (June 26 UT),
though it does appear sporadically on the night immediately pre-
ceding this (June 25; Fig. 6). The slower variations are bluer when
brighter, whereas the sub-second ﬂaring displays the opposite trend
(Figs. 2, 3).

4.1 Origin of the sub-second ﬂaring

With an orbital period of 6.47 days (Casares et al. 1992), the ex-
pected binary separation in V404 Cyg is ∼ 100 light-seconds, im-
plying a large accretion disc size. So the fast sub-second ﬂares seen
by ULTRACAM are too speedy to be caused by standard repro-
cessing on any extended structures like a disc or outﬂowing mate-
rial. Their steep red spectral slope (§ 3.4) could, instead, be con-
sistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission (although see next

paragraph for further discussion). We observe ﬂaring on a range of
timescales, with some of the sub-second ﬂares being unresolved
down to our best time resolution of 24 ms, which would corre-
spond to a light travel time across 500 RG (Gravitational radii) for
a 9 M⊙ BH. This is consistent with the expected and inferred sizes
of the jet base during hard state outbursts of some other XRBs (e.g.
Markoff et al. 2001, 2003; Casella et al. 2010; Gandhi et al. 2010,
2011; Kalamkar et al. 2015). So, both the characteristic timescale
and the spectral properties of the fast ﬂares can be accounted for
with optically-thin synchrotron emission from a jet. Moreover, if a
single population of particles is emitting broadband radiation span-
ning both g′ and r′, we do not expect any time delay between
the two bands, as observed (Fig. 8). The fact that ﬂaring is per-
sistently present on June 26 implies that the emitting jet zone is
also persistent throughout the length of this observation, at least. A
(quasi)stable compact jet could then be the source of these ﬂares.

Assuming an extinction of AV = 4 mag, we ﬁnd the slope of
the power law of the fast ﬂares (above the slow variations) to
be αgr
ﬂares = –1.3 ± 0.4 (§ 3.4). The distribution of jet plasma ener-
gies (p) is related to the observed spectral slope in the optically-
thin power law as p = 1–2 α (Rybicki & Lightman 1979), implying
p = 3.6 ± 0.8. This is steeper than is typical for optically-thin syn-
chrotron in XRBs, for which α ∼ –0.7 (and p ∼ 2.5) is more com-
mon (e.g. Hynes et al. 2003; Gandhi et al. 2011). Steep power law
slopes have been observed before (cf. the cases of XTE J1550–564,
XTE J1118+480 and Swift J1357.2–0933 where α ≈ –1.3 to –1.5
were observed; Russell et al. 2010, 2013; Shahbaz et al. 2013). A
mixture of thermal and non-thermal particle energies could poten-
tially explain such a slope. Cyclotron-like emission has also been
invoked to explain the fast optical ﬂaring seen in other sources
(Fabian et al. 1982). However, we again stress that reddening in-
troduces a signiﬁcant uncertainty of 0.5 in these optical power law
spectral slopes, potentially making them consistent with optically-
thin synchrotron at face value.

ˇ404 clearly possessed a strong radio jet during the present out-
burst, and our June 26 observations were closely contemporaneous
with a giant radio ﬂare reported by Trushkin et al. (2015a). This
can be seen in Fig. 11 which shows the long-term RATAN 22 GHz
radio light curve measured by Trushkin et al. in the top panel, and a
zoom-in around our June 26 ULTRACAM observation in the lower
panel together with the 13.9 GHz lightcurve from the AMI tele-
scope which also caught the ﬂare. This was the strongest radio ﬂare
of the 2015 outburst. So it is not surprising that there is a jet con-
tribution to the optical emission at this time. It should be noted,
however, that the radio spectral index shows dramatic variations
in time, swinging between positive (optically-thick) and negative
(optically-thin) values (Trushkin et al. 2015). Some of these swings
may be related to time lags between the various frequencies, as
pointed out from radio and sub-mm monitoring by Tetarenko et al.
(2015). If so, then it is non-trivial to extrapolate between the radio
and the optical bands using a simplistic power law, say.

How much power do the optical ﬂares carry? We corrected
the r′
light curve of the source for interstellar extinction of
AV = 4 mag using the standard reddening law of Cardelli et al.
(1989) and computed the peak power in the strongest observed
ﬂare (lower panel of Fig. 4) above the underlying slow mean
as νLν = 4.1 × 1036 erg s−1, or 0.4 % of the Eddington lumi-
the central r′ band wavelength of 6231 ˚A and for
nosity, at
a distance of 2.4 kpc (Miller-Jones et al. 2009). Assuming that
the observed steep power law extends down to a frequency of
1.8 × 1014 Hz where a synchrotron spectral break (νb) was in-
ferred to be present in the hard state of the 1989 outburst by

Russell et al. (2013), the integrated luminosity in the brightest
ﬂare between the assumed break and the g′ band is similar, at
L(νbreak −g′) ≈ 5.4 × 1036 erg s−1. For comparison, we also state
the integrated luminosity in the mean ﬂare SED plotted in Fig. 7,
which is L(νbreak −g′) ≈ 3.0 × 1036 erg s−1 above the underlying
slow SED. In the jet scenario, this represents a lower limit to the
integrated jet radiative power, with contributions at longer wave-
lengths extending to the radio at one end, and at higher frequencies
extending up to the (unknown) cooling break, unaccounted for.

Knowledge of the break frequency (νb) can be used to con-
strain the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the synchrotron emitting
plasma. This has been done in a number of recent works assuming
a single zone plasma under equipartition (e.g. Chaty et al. 2011;
Gandhi et al. 2011; Russell et al. 2013; Tomsick et al. 2015). We
do not detect an obvious break within the ULTRACAM spec-
tral range, but the optically-thin slopes that we measure imply
νb < 4.8 × 1014 Hz (the r′ band central frequency). If we assume
that the fast ﬂares do originate from optically-thin synchrotron
then, using the mean r′ ﬂux for the bright ﬂares (Fig. 7) together
with Eqs. 1 and 2 from Gandhi et al. (2011) for the magnetic ﬁeld
(B) and radius (R) of the emission zone, we ﬁnd B < 1.7 × 105 G
and R >140 RG. Here, we have assumed a scale height of 1 for the
optically-thin region relative to its emission radius R (as deﬁned in
the appendix of Chaty et al. 2011) because the fast ﬂares must arise
from a compact region; however, we note that the above calcula-
tions are quite insensitive to the scale height and the assumption of
equipartition. The above lower limit on R inferred from the SED
is consistent with the upper limit of ∼ 500 RG derived from the
variability timescale of the unresolved ﬂares.

Strong fast ﬂaring is persistent during only one of our four
nights of observation. On the preceding night of June 25, it is spo-
radic and short-lived (Fig. 6). So it is clearly much more tran-
sient as compared to the slower variations which persist on all
nights. Fast ﬂaring unresolved to a time resolution of ∼ 1–2 s was
also found to be brief and sporadic by Hynes et al. (2015a) and
Terndrup et al. (2015), for periods of up to ∼ 25 mins. If the source
of this sporadic variability were also the compact jet, this would
imply strong changes in the compact jet spectrum on timescales
as short as ∼ 100 s, as a result of which the rapidly variable opti-
cal synchrotron component appears and disappears on these times.
Variations in the location of the break frequency have been pre-
viously reported in the infrared SED of GX 339–4 (Gandhi et al.
2011) sampled at timescales of ∼ 90 mins and less. In addition, it
is noteworthy that V404 Cyg itself has also been found to display
dramatic swings in its radio jet spectral index during quiescence on
timescales of tens of minutes (Rana et al. 2015). For completeness,
we note that we cannot rule out a transient clearing (during these
short periods on June 25, and for the full duration of our observation
on June 26) of an otherwise persistent screen of absorbing matter,
which then reveals fast variability in the inner source regions.

We note that our observations were also closely contempo-
raneous with some of the strongest X-ray ﬂaring activity seen in
the 2015 outburst of ˇ404. This is illustrated in Fig.11 which shows
the publicly available long-term 25–200 keV X-ray lightcurve from
the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite
(Kuulkers 2015). The zoom-in on June 26 shows that the ULTRA-
CAM observation coincided with the penultimate strong hard X-
ray ﬂare (at ∼ MJD 57199.2). The next X-ray ﬂare (centred around
∼ MJD 57199.7) was the very brightest ﬂare of the entire 2015 out-
burst, following which the source began its decline to quiescence
(Segreto et al. 2015; Ferrigno et al. 2015; Martin-Carrillo et al.
2015; Sivakoff et al. 2015). In contrast, the source X-ray count rate

during at least two of our prior observations (June 21 and 25) was
fainter by at least an order of magnitude than on June 26. There are
no INTEGRAL observations from the ﬁrst night of June 20. So it
may be that there was strong, fast ﬂaring on June 26 in the optical
because that was when the source was particularly active in radio
and in X-rays. One may speculate that we are observing jet activity
related to the ejections in a ﬁnal, massive ﬂare and source shut-off,
but this needs further investigation.

4.2 Origin of the slow variations

The origin of the slow variations is less clear. They differ from the
sub-second ﬂaring in several aspects. Their characteristic timescale
of several hundred seconds is, of course, orders of magnitude
longer than the fast ﬂares. In addition, they also differ in terms
of their colours (being bluer when brighter, with stronger variabil-
ity power in the bluer bands; Fig. 3) and also appear to be much
more persistent over the entire set of ULTRACAM observations (as
well as other observations; Hardy et al. 2015; Hynes et al. 2015b,a;
Terndrup et al. 2015; Wiersema 2015; Scarpaci et al. 2015). More-
over, there is evidence for positive time delays and skewed CCFs
in the sense of the redder bands lagging the blue (Fig. 9). The long
timescales and red lags argue against optically-thin emission from a
single-zone compact jet, whose emission is likely to vary on much
faster timescales and be correlated between the bands.

The SED spectral slopes are certainly bluer than those of the
fast ﬂares on the night of June 26 (Fig. 7). What about the spectral
slopes on the other nights? Fig. 12 shows αslow(g′, r′) as a function
of ﬂux for the slow variations on all nights. This is similar to the
colour–ﬂux plot for June 26 (Fig. 7), with a larger (positive) spec-
tral slope α here being equivalent to a smaller (bluer) g′–r′ colour.
There are clear and strong variations in spectral slopes on all nights,
with a full range of variations of ∆αslow of ≈ 1.7. Yet, there are
underlying patterns to these variations. In particular, there appears
to be a diagonal locus of variations in the αslow–ﬂux plane, with
slope increasing as the source becomes brighter. The slope of this
variation is approximately similar on all nights, although the ﬁrst
night of June 20 shows a systematic offset from the other nights.4
Furthermore, the night of June 25 shows an additional evolution off
towards the lower left in this plane towards steep negative slopes as
the source dims (this occurs during the sharp ﬂux drop at the end
of the observation on this night; Fig. 1).

Any model for these slow variations must be able to account
for these dramatic spectral slope variations. However, we also cau-
tion that the absolute values of αslow are subject to signiﬁcant
uncertainties. The dereddening uncertainties of 10% discussed in
section 3.4 introduce a systematic shift of ∆αslow = 0.5, denoted
by arrows in the ﬁgure (and also shown as the shaded regions in
the SED of June 26 in Fig. 7). Furthermore, the Hα emission line
contribution was found to be 11% in analysis of our optical spec-
trum quasi-simultaneous on June 26. Removing this can yield the
continuum spectral slope free of Hα, which is larger (bluer) than
αslow(g′, r′) by ∆αslow ≈ +0.39. The magnitude of this correc-
tion is also shown in Figs. 7 and 12. Whereas other emission lines
such as Hβ would affect the other bands, their effect is expected to
be smaller. However, Hα is known to be strongly variable during

the outburst (e.g. Wagner et al. 2015; Munoz-Darias et al. 2015;
Scarpaci et al. 2015; Caballero-Garcia et al. 2015), and a single,
average correction is undoubtedly an over-simpliﬁcation. Given all
these potential systematics, we are cautious about drawing any de-
tailed conclusions about the slow variations, and restrict ourselves
to a more qualitative discussion below.

Can reprocessing explain the ULTRACAM light curves? Us-
ing X-ray observations from the Swiftsatellite carried out simulta-
neously with the June 21 ULTRACAM run, Gandhi et al. (2015b)
found a close correlation between the slow optical and X-ray varia-
tions, with an optical delay on the order of tens of seconds. Specif-
ically, the correlation was found during the time when the oscilla-
tory pattern with a characteristic timescale of a few hundred sec-
onds was present on this night. Such a delay would be consistent
with a reprocessing origin for the expected size of the accretion disc
in V404 Cyg. If so, the oscillatory pattern could potentially result
from X-ray reprocessing.5 But this oscillatory pattern is not obvi-
ously present on the other nights, suggesting that any contribution
from reprocessing may be changing between the nights. This is sup-
ported by the changing nightly optical inter-band time lags found
in our optical data (Fig. 9). Rodriguez et al. (2015) also found evi-
dence of a varying reprocessing contribution from the INTEGRAL
data, with the optical lag varying between ∼0 to 20–30 mins. These
long lags are much larger than the longest possible reprocessing
(light-travel) time for the size of the binary. We also note that the
optical variations across the four nights of our observations are rel-
atively mild as compared to the X-ray variability which is orders
of magnitude larger (see Fig. 11). In other words, the optical varia-
tions do not follow the L1/2
X−ray trend expected from standard disc
reprocessing (van Paradijs & McClintock 1994).

It is also unclear whether scattering and absorption due to in-
tervening matter plays an important role in explaining the optical
variations. X-ray observations suggest that absorption due to a wind
may be high enough to hide the central regions even at high ener-
gies (King et al. 2015; Kuulkers et al. 2015; Motta et al. 2015), in
which case any optical photons from the central regions would also
not escape. But if electron scattering were to dominate, variabil-
ity is expected to be wavelength-independent, which is not what
we observe in the optical. Changing dust reddening in a wind may
be a possibility, but in this scenario, the apparently stable loci of
the spectral slope evolution (Fig. 12) would require reddening lev-
els to be ﬁne-tuned to the ﬂux changes across the different nights,
which seems unlikely. Moreover, the naive expectation would be to
see much stronger optical variations (perhaps orders of magnitude
in ﬂux) in response to a clumpy wind which is dense enough to
signiﬁcantly absorb X-rays. Despite the impressive variability ob-
served, the ULTRACAM data do not show such strong variations,
although we cannot rule out their presence on other nights when we
did not observe.

Using simultaneous optical/radio monitoring, Mooley et al.
(2015) found that the strong and slow optical variations correlate
with variations seen in the radio by the AMI telescope, suggest-
ing a non-thermal contribution to the emission process for the slow
optical variations. Moreover, ﬂux-dependent spectral slope varia-
tions similar to those that we see in Fig. 12 have also been linked
to synchrotron jet emission in other sources (e.g. observations of
XTE J1550–564 by Russell et al. 2010). The magnetic ﬁeld asso-

4 This offset corresponds to a ﬂux offset of ≈ 10% (either a decrease in g′
or an increase in r′ by this factor would shift the locus for this night to be in
agreement with the others, though we could not identify an obvious source
that could introduce such as shift).

5 Which is not to say that other components in the optical light curves are
unrelated to reprocessing, since the ULTRACAM/Swift coverage was only
simultaneous during this period.

ciated with the slow variations is likely to be much lower than the
compact fast ﬂares (Tetarenko et al. 2015 estimate a ﬁeld strength
of ∼ few Gauss). The fact that αslow for the slow variations is
slightly ﬂatter than the αfast values measured for the fast ﬂares
on June 26 (see Fig. 7) could be a result either of mixing of mul-
tiple emission components (non-thermal radiation and reprocess-
ing, say), or a differing distribution of particle energies between
the slow variations and the fast ﬂares.

The ultimate origin of these variations appears to be complex,
and we do not attempt to model them further here. But we empha-
sise that any model for these slow variations must account for their
rather long characteristic timescales. The light travel time for vari-
ations spanning ∼ 100–1000 s is similar to, or even larger than, the
maximal extent of the disc of 1012 cm (or ∼ 7 × 105 RG) inferred
by ˙Zycki et al. (1999) during the 1989 outburst. So if the variations
result from cyclotron or optically-thin synchrotron in an extended,
perhaps multi-zone, plasma (e.g. ejected blobs), these ejecta ought
to be very large, with sizes commensurate with the binary itself.
Instead, the size of an emission zone in a standard viscous thin
disc varying on ∼ 1000 s timescales would be ∼ 3 × 108 cm, or
250 RG (M/9 M⊙) (α/0.1)−1 (h/R/0.1)−2, where α here repre-
sents the viscosity parameter and h/R is the relative disc height
scale (though the observed spectral slopes do not support emission
from a viscous disc alone, as already discussed). If the slow vari-
ations are instead associated with some form of thermal instability
timescale, a larger size scale of ∼ 5000 RG (M/9 M⊙) (α/0.1)−1
is possible (Frank et al. 2002). Accretion rate variations on these
scales, which are much smaller than the overall binary size, could
then manifest in the optical. For instance, synchrotron emission in a
steady jet in which fast variations are ‘smoothed’ out over multiple
emission zones, with only the more substantial longer variations
remaining, is one plausible scenario to explain our observations.

Finally, we note that no strong quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) are found in our PSDs, which are instead dominated by
broadband noise features. This appears to be in contrast to QPOs
seen in the optical and infrared PSDs of other XRBs during hard
state outbursts (e.g. Gandhi 2009; Kalamkar et al. 2015, and ref-
erences therein), although we note that we cannot unambiguously
rule out the presence of low frequency QPOs given the short du-
ration of our lightcurves. In particular, the night of June 21 shows
the oscillatory patterns of variability on timescales of ∼ 200–500 s
(Fig. 1), and found to be correlated with simultaneous X-ray varia-
tions by Gandhi et al. (2015b). There is excess power in the PSDs
on these timescales (Fig. 3), but no sharp QPO-like feature stands
out immediately. So the presence of any precessing hot ﬂow, as in-
ferred in other sources (e.g. Ingram & Done 2011), does not stand
out in our observations. One caveat in this discussion is that our
optical light curves may be diluted by emission lines (in particular
Hα and Hβ which lie in the r′ and g′ bands, respectively), and ex-
tended line emission zones may smooth over underlying continuum
QPO variability.

4.3 Multi-component optical variability in V404 Cyg and

other XRBs

Multicomponent optical variability on short timescales, including
potential contributions from a hot ﬂow, accretion disc reprocess-
ing, and (in several cases) a jet, appear to be a common fea-
ture in many XRBs during the hard state. Strong and fast sub-
second ﬂaring behaviour has been seen in a number of XRBs
during the hard state, in particular GX 339–4 (Motch et al. 1982;
Imamura et al. 1990; Steiman-Cameron et al. 1997; Gandhi et al.

2008; Fender et al. 1997; Gandhi et al. 2010; Casella et al. 2010)
and XTE J1118+480 (Kanbach et al. 2001; Malzac et al. 2004),
where it has been attributed to synchrotron emission from a jet with
increasing dominance towards the red. A steep spectral slope in the
optical has also been observed in XTE J1118+480 during the hard
state with strong jet activity (e.g. Hynes et al. 2003).

On intermediate (∼seconds to mins) timescales, V4641 Sgr
and Swift J1753.5–0127 have shown pronounced optical variations
(Uemura et al. 2002; Durant et al. 2009). Whereas Swift J1753.5–
0127 appears to be dominated by emission from a hot ﬂow
in the optical (Durant et al. 2009; Veledina et al. 2011), those in
V4641 Sgr remain unclear, though a non-thermal origin appears
to be very likely (Uemura et al. 2004). Finally, infrared variations
on timescales of minutes to hours have been extensively stud-
ied in GRS 1915+105 and associated with synchrotron emission
(Fender et al. 1997; Eikenberry et al. 1998). Their characteristic
timescales appear to be quite similar to the slow optical vari-
ations in V404 Cyg. Infrared/X-ray cross-correlations have con-
ﬁrmed this, and ﬁnd that the infrared emission zone can be as-
sociated with a synchrotron-emitting plasma on a large scale of
∼few × 1011 cm (Lasso-Cabrera & Eikenberry 2013).

The fast optical ﬂares seen in GX 339–4 were somewhat
stronger than observed in V404 Cyg, with several of the ∼ 100 ms
r′ and g′ ﬂares during the 2007 hard state observation of GX 339-4
exceeding a factor of 2 above mean (Gandhi et al. 2010). The peak
optical ﬂare luminosities in that outburst reached ∼ 1036 erg s−1,
of the same order as observed for V404 Cyg here. In section 3.4,
we have shown that subtracting the SED at the times of the fast
ﬂares from that of the slow variations on June 26 gives a me-
dian αgr
ﬂares = –1.3 ± 0.4 as an estimate of the variable PL whose
contribution is reddening the ﬂare SEDs. This slope is steeper
than seen in GX 339–4 (Gandhi et al. 2011), but is similar to
those seen in XTE J1118+480 and XTE J1550–564 during outburst
(Russell et al. 2013).

On the other hand, the optical/X-ray CCF strength appears to
be much stronger in V404 Cyg (Gandhi et al. 2015b). As already
discussed, this cannot be entirely ascribed to reprocessing, although
there is strong Hα emission which is likely to dilute the true r′ band
continuum variability (e.g. Wagner et al. 2015; Munoz-Darias et al.
2015; Scarpaci et al. 2015). With an orbital period approximately
four times longer than that of GX 339–4, V404 Cyg’s accretion
disc is also expected to be larger, which sould (in principle) result
in stronger reprocessing and also dilute the strength of any syn-
chrotron jet ﬂares.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have analysed high temporal resolution optical multi-band
(u′g′r′) light curves obtained with ULTRACAM during the
June 2015 outburst. We are able to probe variations over approx-
imately ﬁve orders of magnitude in Fourier frequency. Our main
results are summarised below.

(i) The data show a diverse range of variations on all timescales,
but reveal at least two prominent variability components: (1) ‘slow
variations’ with characteristic timescales of hundreds of seconds,
and (2) ‘fast sub-second ﬂares’ (section 3.1, Figs. 1, 2, 4).

(ii) These components differ in their colours and time lags. The
fast ﬂares show red colours at peak, whereas the slow variations are
stronger in the bluer bands. (section 3.4, Figs. 2, 7).

(iii) The multi-band PSDs are dominated by the slow variations
and rise steeply towards low Fourier frequencies on all nights, but

Figure 11. The top panel shows the INTEGRAL 25–200 keV light curve (based upon Off-line Scientiﬁc Analysis v.10.1) for the ﬁrst ≈ 10 days of the
June 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument (blue; Kuulkers 2015), overlaid with the 22 GHz radio light curve from the RATAN-600
telescope (magenta; Trushkin et al. 2015a). The times of the ULTRACAM observations are highlighted by the orange shaded strips. The bottom panel focuses
on the last night around the ULTRACAM data (shown in red). In addition, the 13.9 GHz light curve from AMI overlapping with our ULTRACAM coverage
is shown in magenta. The ULTRACAM sub-second ﬂaring was caught when the source was very active in both radio and X-rays, in between some of the
strongest multiwavelength ﬂares over the entire outburst.

show a dramatic increase in the ∼ 1 Hz variability power by a fac-
tor of ≈ 100 on the last night of June 26. This night clearly shows
the reversal of the dominant source of variability power above and
below ∼ 0.01 Hz between the faster red variations and slower blue
variations (section 3.2, Fig. 3).

(iv) The fast ﬂares display complex ﬂare proﬁles (Figs. 4, 5), but
show no time lags between g′ and r′ down to the best time resolu-
tion of 24 ms (section 3.3, Fig. 8). In contrast, the cross-correlation
functions of the slow variations are indicative of underlying, weak
red lags of a few seconds (section 3.5, Fig. 9).

(v) We interpret these observables in terms of an optically-
thin synchrotron origin for the fast ﬂares having short character-
istic timescales and high optical luminosities ∼ 1036 erg s−1 (sec-
tion 4.1). The spectral slopes of the fast ﬂares after removing the
underlying slow variations is αgr
ﬂares ∼ –1.3, which is steeper than
typical for optically-thin synchrotron from a compact jet alone,
and could be indicative of a mixture by a thermal particle distri-
bution. However, including systematic dereddening uncertainties,
this slope could also be consistent with αgr

ﬂares ∼ –0.8.

(vi) Under the compact jet scenario, we can place limits on

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–20

the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the synchrotron emission zone of
B ∼< 2 × 105 G, and a zone size R ∼> 140 RG. If the fastest ﬂares
arise within this zone, the variability timescale of the unresolved
ﬂares of < 24 ms implies R ∼< 500 RG (section 4.1).

(vii) These fast ﬂares are prominent and persistent on the night
when the source reached the peak of its outburst in terms of its
observed X-ray ﬂux, and also showed the brightest radio ﬂares
(Fig. 11). They also appear sporadically on the preceding night with
short durations of ∼ 30 s (Fig. 6), which places constraints on the
timescales over which the compact jet spectrum can change dras-
tically, appearing and disappearing in the optical on timescales of
order ∼ minutes or less (section 4.1) – assuming that they do, in-
deed, arise from a compact jet, and their appearance/disappearance
is not controlled by other effects such as changing line-of-sight ab-
sorption/reddening, say.

(viii) On the other hand, the origin of the slow variations is far
from clear. X-ray reprocessing likely plays a role in some of these
variations but appears unlikely to be their sole driver, and there
is suggestive evidence of a non-thermal contribution to the slow
variations also (section 4.2; cf. reports by other authors of changing

(ix) We ﬁnd that the optical spectral slopes can change rapidly
but evolve according to quasi-stable loci across all nights (Fig. 12).
However, we caution that dereddening uncertainties and the con-
tribution of Hα can strongly affect the optical photometric spectral
slopes (section 3.4, 3.6, 4.2).

(x) No obvious QPOs are found in the optical light curves,

There is a wealth of high-quality optical data (especially from small
telescopes) during the 2015 outburst, examination of which should
shed more light on the nature of the slow variations. In addition,
this outburst galvanised much of the XRB community to coordinate
multiwavelength observational efforts (e.g. Knigge et al. 2015), re-
sulting in strictly simultaneous periods of coverage over much of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Cross-correlation of fast optical and
X-ray light curves (e.g. Kanbach et al. 2001; Gandhi et al. 2008;
Durant et al. 2008), and investigation of infrared and radio light
curves (Dallilar et al. in prep.) may help to answer many of the
questions raised herein.

Post-submission of our paper, several new preprints and publica-
tions on the outburst have become public. Their key results rele-
vant to our work are brieﬂy mentioned here. With regard to the ori-
gin of the optical variability, Kimura et al. (2016) present an anal-
ysis of the public optical photometric data gathered by small tele-
scopes covering the majority of the bright part of the outburst, and
show that the slow variations have distinct parallels with the (X-
ray) variability modes identiﬁed in GRS 1915+105. They conclude
that limit cycle oscillations in the inner disc generate X-ray vari-
ations, which are then reprocessed on the outer disc and generate
the slow optical variability observed (Bernardini et al. 2016 simi-
larly interpret the pre-outburst source evolution in terms of a vis-
cous thermal instability). The ∼ minute–timescale oscillatory pat-
tern that we observe on June 21 is similar to what Kimura et al.
term the ‘heartbeat’ oscillation in their light curves. In contrast to
a reprocessing scenario, Mart´ı et al. (2016) tentatively interpret the
source behaviour in terms of synchrotron radiation from expanding
plasmons, again drawing a parallel to GRS 1915+105. These au-

thors also report the presence of redder band lags with respect to
bluer ones, with the lags being around ∼ 1 min (longer than what
we report), but changeable and difﬁcult to pin down. The properties
of jet models have been further investigated by Jenke et al. (2016)
and Tanaka et al. (2016). Based upon modelling of Fermi Gamma
Ray Burst Monitor observations, Jenke et al. propose that X-rays
from a jet could be seeding Compton-upscattering to the Gamma
ray band, similar to the conclusions drawn earlier by Roques et al.
(2015) based upon INTEGRAL analysis. Tanaka et al. (2016) ﬁnd
a low linear optical polarisation degree intrinsic to the source,
and suggest either a disc or optically-thick synchrotron origin for
the optical emission. They also derive constraints on the physical
parameters of the jet (B ﬁeld ∼ 105 G and emission region size
≈ 108 cm) which are of the same order of magnitude as the limits
that we present in section 4.1. Finally, Radhika et al. (2016) study
the Swift/XRT source spectra and conclude that absorption features
and a variable Fe line point to a wind origin.

All the above works, and their (sometimes) disparate con-
clusions, emphasise the complexity of the present outburst of
V404 Cyg. It is important to keep in mind that most of the con-
troversy centres on the variable component that we refer to as the
‘slow variations’. In contrast, the study of the sub-second variations
is unique to our work, and (as we have discussed) their properties
all point to a non-thermal origin, and are consistent with arising in
a compact jet.

It is worth noting the recent launch of the ASTROSAT mis-
sion by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Singh et al. 2014).
Its Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter instrument can pro-
vide exquisite sensitivity at high time resolution. Simultaneous fast
timing capability in the ultraviolet is provided by the Ultra Vi-
olet Imaging Telescope (Kumar et al. 2012). Given the fast opti-
cal variability that we have presented in our work, this combina-
tion of instruments can be very effective for the study of future
XRB outbursts. The approximate 30 year timescale between out-
bursts of V404 Cyg suggests that it may be too optimistic to hope
for another outburst from it any time soon, although we note that
in December 2015, the source did undergo a mini outburst (pos-
sibly a secondary to the June outburst) which was followed up
by several telescopes (e.g. Barthelmy et al. 2015; Lipunov et al.
2015; Jenke et al. 2015; Trushkin et al. 2015b; Hardy et al. 2016),
and whose detailed study will be important. And, as already noted,
V404 Cyg is well known for its variability even in quiescence (e.g.
Shahbaz et al. 2003; Bernardini & Cackett 2014; Rana et al. 2015).
So future observations of V404 Cyg with ASTROSAT could still
prove useful.

A1 APPENDIX

A1.1 Flux calibration

Ideally, one would use the comparison star for photometry. How-
ever, V404 Cyg was the brightest object in the ﬁeld of view during
outburst, especially in the red, and the comparison stars used are
not photometric standards. Therefore, the ULTRACAM ﬂux cal-
ibration is based upon zeropoints derived from measurements of
two photometric standard stars on two nights during the week of
observation. An independent, approximate test of the ﬂux calibra-
tion is possible using AAVSO6 data, which had good overlap with

6 Kafka, S., 2015, Observations from the AAVSO International Database,
http://www.aavso.org

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–20

the ULTRACAM observations on the two nights of June 20 and
25. We also checked against comparison star photometry and com-
puted resulting systematic uncertainties on the ﬂux calibration, all
of which is described below.

The photometric standards were HD 121968 observed on
June 24 in u′, g′ and r′, and GCRV 8758 observed in u′, g′ and z′
on June 26 (we do not use the z′ calibration herein). The zeropoints
measured are 25.02 (u′), 26.96 (g′) and 26.59 (r′), respectively,
on June 24, and 25.09 (u′) and 26.95 (g′) on June 26. These zero-
points apply to an incident rate of 1 electron per second, with gain
factors of 1.16, 1.11 and 1.19 in u′g′r′, respectively. We assumed
zeropoints of 25.09 (u′), 26.95 (g′) and 26.59 (r′) throughout our
work. All observations were carried out not far off zenith, at air-
mass < 1.1. Airmass corrections were applied for each night, using
u′g′r′ extinction coefﬁcients of 0.49, 0.16 and 0.07, respectively.

We checked our calibration by computing the magni-
tudes of
the comparison stars. The comparison star was
URAT1 620-473723 (Zacharias et al. 2015) at RA = 20:24:07.181,
Dec = +33:50:51.66 on June 20, which is also identiﬁed as star
‘C1’ of Udalski & Kaluzny (1991). Hereafter, this is referred to as
‘comparison star 1’. On the remaining nights, the comparison star
was URAT1 620-473466 at RA = 20:23:56.44, Dec = +33:48:16.9
(‘comparison star 2’). The weather conditions were good on all
nights. Comparing the nightly median count rates of comparison
star 2 during June 21–26, we ﬁnd agreement to within 4%, 0.5%
and 1% (standard deviation) in u′, g′ and r′, respectively.

AAVSO reported calibrated Vega magnitudes of V404 Cyg
during the 2015 outburst, mostly in the BV I ﬁlters in the Johnsons-
Cousins system. On June 20 and June 25, there are 19 and 175 re-
ported B observations, respectively, overlapping with the ULTRA-
CAM observing window, and many more in the V I ﬁlters. The
observations were carried out by many different observers, as a re-
sult of which the photometric quality of the data can vary. More-
over, the observations are not strictly simultaneous, so there is some
uncertainty related to variability between observations. However,
the median SEDs computed from these data ought to be represen-
tative of the source, at least for the purposes of our approximate
cross-check against the ULTRACAM calibrations. We computed
the SEDs by interpolating the V I band photometry on to the near-
est B band times, and applying dereddening corrections assuming
an AV = 4 mag and the Cardelli et al. (1989) law, as before. The
median AAVSO SEDs are shown in Fig. A1 for both the nights of
overlap, together with the median ULTRACAM SEDs computed
using the zeropoint ﬂux calibration described above. The agree-
ment in both overall ﬂux and SED shape is encouraging, especially
when one considers the differing bands used, and all the caveats
mentioned above regarding the AAVSO comparison.

Finally, we also cross-checked our ULTRACAM ﬂux cal-
ibration using the known magnitudes of the comparison stars.
Udalski & Kaluzny (1991) list magnitudes of V = 12.817 and
B = 13.523 for comparison star 1. Using the photometric transfor-
mation equations provided by Smith et al. (2002), we ﬁnd SDSS
magnitudes of g′ = 13.128 and r′ = 12.626 (U and/or u′ magnitudes
are generally not available for ﬁeld stars). The SED of V404 Cyg
using these SDSS comparison star magnitudes for count rate cross-
calibration is also shown in Fig. A1, and show good agreement with
the other methods.

For comparison star 2, the reported g′ = 13.372 and r′ = 12.307
in the APASS system (Zacharias et al. 2015). However, using
our zeropoints to obtain calibrated magnitudes, we estimate
g′ = 12.69±0.01 and r′ = 12.41±0.01. The g′ magnitude is brighter
than reported by a very large offset of ≈ 0.7 mag. The reason for

18

P. Gandhi et al.

this discrepancy is unclear, but we note that the APASS-reported
g′ mag is based upon a single observation with no associated
uncertainty. If we instead use the reported B = 13.39±0.40 and
V = 12.438±0.11, the transformed g′ = 12.88 ± 0.22 agrees within
uncertainty with our prediction of g′ = 12.69. The transformed
r′ = 12.14±0.24, on the other hand, is mildly discrepant (brighter)
by ≈ 0.27 mag. The resultant V404 Cyg SEDs using these calibra-
tions are also shown in Fig. A1, as the red points and dotted lines,
and appears redder than derived from the other methods on June 25.
The steeper SED on June 25 is entirely ascribable to the difference
of ≈ 0.27 mag in the mean values of predicted and transformed r′
values. We conﬁrmed that the comparison star magnitudes have in-
herent disparities by additionally using the IPHAS2 catalogue re-
ported Vega magnitudes of R = 12.39, I = 11.947 and transforming
these to SDSS r′ using the equations of Jordi et al. (2006). We ﬁnd
r′ = 12.60, which is, indeed discrepant (fainter) by ≈ 0.46 mag than
the APASS-transformed mag or r′ = 12.14 above, and 0.19 mag
fainter than our prediction of r′ = 12.41. Whether these differences
are due to measurement problems or due to the star being variable
is unknown.

These comparisons suggest differences in the ﬂux calibration
of ≈ 0.2 in g′ and r′, especially on the nights of June 21–26. Given
the issues with the reported comparison star magnitudes discussed
above, the fact that these are not available in u′, and the reasonable
(approximate) agreement of the ULTRACAM photometric stan-
dard based SEDs with the AAVSO SEDs, we prefer the ULTRA-
CAM photometric standard zeropoints for our work. However, this
systematic uncertainty should be kept in mind if one is interested in
the exact SED shapes. Since these are systematic uncertainties, they
do not affect any of the discussion related to the relative variability
in ﬂuxes and spectral indices.

A1.2 Light curves overlay for June 26

Fig. A2 enlarges the ﬂux-calibrated June 26 lightcurves to show an-
other perspective. As compared to Fig. 2, here, the bands have been
overlayed on each other fully by shifting g′ and u′ to the median of
the r′ light curve for relative comparison. The slow variations are
immediately seen to have stronger peak-to-peak variability in the
bluer ﬁlters. We detrended the light curves to isolate the continuum
count rate from the fast ﬂares (detailed in section 3.3), and found
maximum peak-to-peak continuum variations of 0.43, 0.42 and
0.35 mag in u′, g′ and r′, respectively. Furthermore, the stronger
r′ spikes above g′ at the times of the fast ﬂares immediately show
that the fast ﬂaring is stronger in r′ than in g′.

Figure A1. Comparison of three methods to compute SEDs of V404 Cyg, as a test of the ﬂux calibration used. The nights of June 20 (Left) and June 25 (Right)
were used because of the availability of useful AAVSO overlap on these nights. The black points and solid curve denote the median SEDs calculated from the
standard calibrations based upon zeropoints derived from photometric standards, and used throughout the main body of the paper. The blue points and dashed
lines are the SEDs computed from AAVSO data in the Johnsons B, V and Cousins I bands. The red dotted points and lines show the ULTRACAM SEDs
with the ﬂux calibration derived from the reported magnitudes of the comparison stars (comparison star 1 for June 20, and comparison star 2 on June 25).
All SEDs are dereddened assuming AV = 4 mag and the Cardelli et al. (1989) law. The error bars show the standard deviation of ﬂuxes, so denote the full
range of variability. But it should be noted that since the variations in the bands are correlated, the variations of the SED shape are milder. There is reasonable
agreement between the AAVSO and ULTRACAM photometric standards methods, in particular.

to the median of the r′ lightcurve to aid direct colour comparison. The plot clearly shows the stronger peak-to-peak changes for the slow variations in the bluer
bands, contrasted with the stronger r′ sub-second ﬂares as compared to g′. Note that the u′ light curve has lower time resolution by a factor of 15 than the
other two bands, so is not suitable for comparing the fast ﬂares with the other bands.
