Abstract

We discuss a residual freedom of the next-to-leading BFKL eigenvalue that origi-
nates from ambiguity in redistributing the next-to-leading (NLO) corrections be-
tween the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue and eigenfunctions in planar N = 4 super-
Yang-Mills (SYM) Theory. In terms of the remainder function of the Bern-Dixon-
Smirnov (BDS) amplitude this freedom is translated to reshuﬄing correction be-
tween the eigenvalue and the impact factors in the multi-Regge kinematics (MRK)
in the next-to-leading logarithm approximation (NLA). We show that the modiﬁed
NLO BFKL eigenvalue suggested by the authors in Ref. [1] can be introduced in
the MRK expression for the remainder function by shifting the anomalous dimen-
sion in the impact factor in such a way that the two and three loop remainder
function is left unchanged to the NLA accuracy.

The kernel of the BFKL (Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov) [2] equation contains real and virtual
gluon emissions. The virtual gluon emissions are included in the infrared divergent gluon Regge
trajectory. At present, the BFKL kernel is known to the next-to-leading (NLO) [3–17] order
for arbitrary color group representation in both QCD and its supersymmetric extensions. The
infrared (IR) divergences cancel between the real and the virtual part of the kernel than pro-
jected on the singlet color state. This cancellation does not happen for the BFKL kernel in the
adjoint representation, but despite being infrared divergent it can be useful in some applications,
which also determine the way one treats the IR terms. For example, in the Bartels-Kwiecinski-
Praszalowicz (BKP) [18] approach of interacting reggeized gluons one can remove ”halves” of two
gluon trajectories, while in calculations of the corrections to the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) [19]
amplitude one removes trajectory of single reggeized gluon in order to obtain the IR ﬁnite expres-
sion for the remainder function. The eigenvalue of reduced IR ﬁnite BFKL kernel obtained in the
”BDS-like” way is commonly known as the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue. The adjoint BFKL eigen-
value at the leading order was calculated by Bartels, Lipatov and Sabio Vera [20] and its NLO
expression was found by Fadin and Lipatov [21]. Then its higher loop corrections were calculated
order by order [22] and in all orders from near-collinear limit using integrability techniques as
well as a non-trivial analytic continuation from the collinear to Regge kinematics [23, 24].

The BFKL approach to the helicity amplitudes in the Regge kinematics was extensively
studied over the last years [25–46] and was very useful in understanding higher order corrections
of the BFKL eigenvalue and the impact factor. However, already at the next-to-next-to-leading
level the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue was shown to have an alerting feature of having a non-vanishing
limit as ν → 0 after setting the conformal spin n = 0 [30], which in not compatible with existence
of a constant BFKL eigenfunction. It was shown [32] that one way to solve this problem is to
account for corrections to the cusp anomalous dimension in the impact factor. In the previous
paper the authors [1] suggested that a more natural way would be to redeﬁne the notion of
the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue exploiting some ambiguity in its deﬁnition. This ambiguity is
related to the way one removes IR terms as well as how one redistributes the NLO corrections

between the eigenvalue and the impact factor. Moreover, the energy scale in the leading logarithm
approximation is not ﬁxed at the leading order and becomes to be important at the NLO level.
The authors claimed that there is enough freedom to modify the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue in such
a way that the corresponding BDS remainder function remains the same with the next-to-leading
logarithm accuracy. In the present paper we show in details how the freedom of redistributing
NLO corrections between the BFKL eigenvalue and eigenfunctions is realized in the remainder
function as interchanging the corresponding corrections between the eigenvalue and the impact
factor. The paper is organized as follows.
In the next section we discuss the origin of the
freedom of redistributing the NLO corrections between the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions of the
reduced BFKL kernel. Then we show how this freedom is realized in the BDS remainder function
modifying the eigenvalue and the impact factors, and explain why this procedure does not aﬀect
the ﬁnal expression of the remainder function to the NLA accuracy.

2 Residual freedom of BFKL eigenvalue and eigenfunc-

tions

In the multi-Regge kinematics (MRK) the eﬀective summation parameter is a ln s
, where s is
s0
the center of mass energy squared and s0 is some energy scale. The leading contribution is of the
order of (a ln s/s0)L−1, where L is a loop order in the perturbative expansion, while the next-to-
leading contribution is suppressed by one power of log of s, namely a (a ln s/s0)L−2 and commonly
is referred to as the next-to-leading logarithm approximation (NLA). In the present paper we
consider only two and three loop BDS remainder function R6|M RK,2→4 to the NLA accuracy in
MRK for the 2 → 4 gluon scattering. To this accuracy the remainder function is fully determined
by the energy scale s0, the leading-order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO)1 impact factor
as well as the LO and the NLO adjoint BFKL eigenvalue in the planar limit. However, there is a
residual freedom related to redistribution of the NLO correction between the BFKL eigenvalue,
the impact factor and the energy scale. This freedom is equivalent to a freedom of redistributing
the NLO corrections between the BFKL eigenvalue and the eigenfunction in such a way that
the BFKL kernel is not aﬀected. To illustrate this statement we schematically write the reduced
infrared ﬁnite BFKL kernel K in the following form

ω ⊗ φ ⊗ φ∗ = K,

(2.1)

where ω and φ are the eigenvalue and the eigenfunction of the BFKL equation. The reduced
infrared ﬁnite BFKL kernel is obtained by removing the Regge gluon trajectory from the full
infrared divergent BFKL kernel in the adjoint representation of the color gauge group. One uses
the reduced adjoint BFKL kernel in calculations of the BDS remainder function because the
gluon Regge trajectory is built in the BDS amplitude by construction.

1For some historical reasons one says that the scattering amplitude is calculated in the next-to-leading loga-
rithm approximation (NLA), but the corresponding BFKL eigenvalue is the next-to-leading order (NLO) eigen-
value. Same for impact factors.

The eigenfunctions of the LO kernel are also eigenfunctions of the NLO kernel (cf. [47]) for
the singlet case. In the color adjoint BFKL for the reduced kernel the situation is the same,
which allowed Fadin and Lipatov to calculate the NLO eigenvalue [21]. We denote it as follows

and thus according to Ref. [21] it reads

ω = ωLO + a ωN LO

(ωLO + a ωN LO) ⊗ φLO ⊗ φ∗

LO = KLO + a KN LO

(2.2)

(2.3)

for the coupling constant a = g2Nc/(8π2). In their previous paper [1] the authors argued that
the NLO eigenvalue ωN LO can be modiﬁed

ωN LO → ˜ωN LO = ωN LO + ∆ωN LO

(2.4)

to comply with the Hermitean separability properties without aﬀecting the remainder function
to this order. This can be done by pushing some of the NLO corrections to the eigenfunction as
follows 2

(ωLO + a ωN LO + a ∆ωN LO) ⊗ (φLO + a φN LO) ⊗ (φLO + a φN LO)∗ = KLO + a KN LO,

(2.5)

which leaves the kernel KLO + a KN LO unchanged. The possibility of the suggested modiﬁcation
of the NLO eigenvalue ωN LO → ωN LO + ∆ωN LO was criticised by Fadin and Fiore [48] based
on their calculations using only the LO eigenfunction that is naturally inconsistent with BFKL
kernel because

(ωLO + a ωN LO + a ∆ωN LO) ⊗ φLO ⊗ φ∗

LO 6= KLO + a KN LO.

(2.6)

The authors absolutely agree with the conclusion made by Fadin and Fiore that the expression

∆ωN LO ⊗ φLO ⊗ φ∗

LO

(2.7)

on its own does not make much sense, but our statement is equivalent to compensating this term
with the NLO corrections to the eigenfunction in such a way that the kernel is left unchanged. In
calculus this corresponds to passing to another expansion basis for some function, which does not
aﬀect the function itself rather modiﬁes the coeﬃcients of its expansion, the BFKL eigenvalue in
our case. To the best of our knowledge, the uniqueness of the eigenfunction of the NLO BFKL
kernel was never discussed before. We leave the analysis of the uniqueness and possible forms
of the NLO BFKL eigenfunction for our further publications and only want to show how this
residual freedom is realized for the BDS remainder function.

2A similar procedure for NLO eigenfunctions of the singlet BFKL kernel was considered in Refs. [49, 50].

3 Rescaling anomalous dimension

The planar BDS amplitude in N = 4 SYM possesses correction starting at two loop order of the
perturbative expansion. One of the reasons for this is the fact that the analytic properties of
the BDS amplitude are not compatible with cut singularities in the complex angular momentum
plane, called Mandelstam or Regge cuts. The Mandelstam cut contributions cannot be obtained
exponentiating the one loop result, in the way the BDS amplitude is constructed. For the 2 → 4
amplitude with two produced particles k1 and k2 the correction to the BDS amplitude, the so-
called remainder function is a function of three conformal cross ratios ui(i = 1, 2, 3) in dual
momentum space expressed in terms of the Mandelstam invariants as follows

u1 =

ss2

s012s123

, u2 =

s1t3
s012t2

, u3 =

s3t1
s123t2

,

(3.1)

where s, si and sij are related to the center of mass energies, while ti stand for the momentum
transfer. In the multi-Regge kinematics (MRK) s ≫ s012, s123 ≫ s1, s2, s3 ≫ t1, t2, t3 the cross
ratios greatly simplify

1 − u1 → 0, ˜u2 =

u2

1 − u1 ∝ 1, ˜u3 =

u3

1 − u1 ∝ 1

(3.2)

and u1 possesses a phase in the Mandelstam region u1 = |u1|e−i2π. The analytic form of the cor-
rection to the BDS amplitude in the multi-Regge kinematics was introduced by Bartels, Lipatov
and Sabio Vera [20] and its more general form [21, 41] reads

At ﬁrst sight those two representation of the LO eigenvalue are not the same numerically and
even have diﬀerent analytic structure, for example setting ν = 0 and then taking limit n → 0.
However, one should remember that they are always considered under the integral over ν and
the sum over integer n, and thus they are equivalent, which can be shown using the reﬂection
identity of the digamma function.

The adjoint NLO BFKL eigenvalue E(1)

ν,n was calculated by Fadin and Lipatov [21] using LO
eigenfunctions from the reduced infrared safe BFKL kernel in the color adjoint representation in
planar N = 4 SYM. In the most compact form it can be written as follows(cf. [41])

remainder function found by Goncharov, Spradlin, Volovich and Vergu [52] to the Mandelstam
region, and then was redeﬁned by Fadin and Lipatov [21] to ﬁt the energy scale in agreement
with the Regge factorization property.

In Ref. [1] the authors argued that it is possible to modify the NLO eigenvalue

(3.16)

accompanied by a change of the impact factor and the energy scale in such way that the remainder
function in (3.3) remains the same to the next-to-leading logarithm (NLA) accuracy in MRK.
This modiﬁcation of the NLO eigenvalue of the BFKL kernel in the color adjoint representation
was needed to have the Hermitian separability and to establish a non-trivial connection with the
corresponding NLO eigenvalue in the color singlet state. The authors also suggested the exact
form of ∆E(1)

ν,n, namely

2 (cid:19) − ψ(cid:18)1 − iν + |n|
2 (cid:19)(cid:21)

2 (cid:19) − ψ′(cid:18)1 − iν + |n|

Below we show that the required modiﬁcation of the NLO eigenvalue can be made by changing

the anomalous dimension 3 as follows

ν → ν + a f (1)

where

ν,n =

2 (cid:19)(cid:21) .

(3.18)

(3.19)

The change of the integration variable ν does not change the integral in (3.3) thus satisfying
the condition that one modiﬁes the NLO eigenvalue E(1)
ν,n leaving the remainder function R6
unchanged to the NLA order in MRK.

3The anomalous dimension of the twist-2 operators is usually denoted by γ = 1/2 + iν in the BFKL approach.
In our analysis, we deal with the integration variable ν, which we call for simplicity ”the anomalous dimension”.

Figure 1: The plot of f (1)

ν,n as a function of ν for diﬀerent values of the conformal spin n.

One can see from Fig. 1 that the function f (1)

ν,n is well behaved in the region of the integration
over ν and is limited by ±π/2, which makes it to be compatible with the perturbative expansion
in a and negligible for large values of ν in change of variable ν → ν + af (1)
ν,n. In particular, for
n = 0 its asymptotic behaviour is given by

and is likely related to a way one removes the infrared divergent Regge gluon trajectory from the
color adjoint BFKL kernel. In the next section we show how the residual freedom of redistributing
NLO corrections is realized for the remainder function in multi-Regge kinematics.

4 Modifying NLO eigenvalue and impact factor.

In the following we show that a simple change of the integration variable given by (3.18) can
be used to redistribute the NLO corrections between that eigenvalue and the impact factor in
such a way that on one hand the resulting expression naturally incorporates the modiﬁed NLO
BFKL eigenvalue in (3.17) and on the other hand it leaves the whole expression for the remainder
function at two and three loops unchanged to the required NLA accuracy.

We write the relevant integral in (3.3) as follows

and its easy to see that we can absorb the second term in the brackets of (4.10) in the redeﬁnition
of the NLO impact factor4 as follows

Strictly speaking, expanding the integral in (4.1) in powers of the coupling constant a after
the substitution ν → ν + af (1)
ν,n we have also to expand the upper and lower limits of the integral,
which are now some functions of the coupling constant a. However, as it was already mentioned,
both the function f (1)
ν,n and its derivative are limited as ν → ±∞ and thus the terms coming
from the expansion of the upper and lower limits vanishes for any ﬁnite value of a. Another ﬁne
point is the case of n = 0, which has to be considered with a special care because of the infrared
divergences and is to be understood as the principal value of the integral over ν as it was shown
for one loop in the Appendix of Ref. [20].

The new integral representation of the MRK remainder function in (4.13), which naturally
incorporates the modiﬁed NLO BFKL eigenvalue presents the main result of this manuscript.
It is worth emphasizing that the remainder function at two and three loops remains the same
with the NLA accuracy and not aﬀected by redistribution of the NLO corrections between the
eigenvalue and the impact factor.

One can consider other ways of writing (4.13), for example expanding some terms in (4.9).
This would redeﬁne the energy scale function Fw and further change the impact factor, but bring
no new insight into the problem under discussion making the result less transparent.

It is clear that the modiﬁcation of the eigenvalue given in (4.7) and (4.14) does not change
the whole expression for the remainder function to the required NLA accuracy, because it merely
follows from the change of the integration variable. On the other hand the meaning of the variable
ν has been changed and it is related to the original ν through ν → ν + af (1)
ν,n. Those two coincide
at the leading order and slightly diﬀer at the next-to-leading order. The function f (1)
ν,n is limited
by ± π
2 for any value of the original ν and n and thus is signiﬁcant only in a small region of the
integration over ν even for reasonably large values of the coupling constant in the perturbative
expansion. The original meaning of n as a conformal spin remains the same and is not aﬀected
by the change of ν. The dependence of the anomalous dimension on the conformal spin through
f (1)
ν,n can be interpreted as a breaking of the axial symmetry in the complex (w, w∗) plane by
causing the dilation to depend on the angle.

5 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper we discussed a residual freedom of redistributing next-to-leading order corrections
between the eigenvalue and impact factors for color adjoint BFKL in planar N = 4 SYM. This
freedom originates from an arbitrariness in solving the BFKL equation by either the eigenfunc-
tions of the LO BFKL kernel or some other eigenfunctions, that can possess NLO corrections.

11

The full solution is then expanded in the basis of the new eigenfunctions and therefore the
eigenvalue, being a coeﬃcient of this expansion, is modiﬁed under a change of the expansion
basis.

We showed that this residual freedom can be exploited to rewrite the two and three loop
expression for the remainder function at the NLA accuracy in MRK in such a way that it naturally
incorporates the modiﬁed NLO BFKL eigenvalue suggested by the authors in Ref. [1] and is given
by (3.16) together with (3.12) and (3.17). This modiﬁcation requires some redeﬁnition of the
NLO impact factor in the (ν, n) space. The impact factor in the (ν, n) space is a convolution
of the impact factor in the momentum space and the BFKL eigenfunction and it is natural to
expect that a change of the eigenfunction is translated into a change of this convolution even for
same the impact factor in the momentum space. The modiﬁcations to the eigenvalue and the
impact factor are of the same origin and therefore they cancel each other leaving the expression
for the remainder function unchanged.

The main motivation for modifying the NLO BFKL eigenvalue in the color adjoint state was
to restore the Hermitian separability property present in the singlet case. This also helped to
establish a non-trivial connection between the adjoint and the singlet NLO eigenvalues eﬀectively
replacing the alternating sums in singlet eigenvalue by sums of the constant sign. This connects
between the cylindrical topology of the singlet BFKL and the plane topology of the adjoint case.
The empirical recipe of the transition from the singlet to the adjoint eigenvalue may serve
a powerful tool for higher loop calculations provided it holds beyond NLO order.
It is very
encouraging that the known corrections to the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue can be expressed in
terms of the constant sign sums while the only known singlet NNLO BFKL eigenvalue (for zero
value of the conformal spin) calculated by N. Gromov, F. Levkovich-Maslyuk and G. Sizov [53]5
is written in terms of alternating harmonic sums with only one negative index.

The residual freedom of redistributing higher order corrections is also present beyond NLA
accuracy and is not ﬁxed by the choice of the NLO eigenvalue and the impact factors presented
in this paper. This freedom can be exploited to establish a connection between the eigenvalues of
the BFKL kernel in color singlet and adjoint states to all orders in the perturbative expansion.
