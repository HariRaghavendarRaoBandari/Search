Introduction

The purpose of the present paper is to study B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representations with
Littlewood-Paley-type norm equivalence in Sobolev spaces of a mixed smoothness, linear sampling algorithms
on Smolyak grids based on them for recovery of functions from these spaces, and the optimality of these algo-
rithms in terms of sampling width. Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy describe some main results. The historical comments
will be given after.

We are interested in quasi-interpolation sampling representation and sampling recovery of functions on Rd
which are 1-periodic at each variable.
It is convenient to consider them as functions deﬁned in the d-torus
Td = [0, 1]d which is deﬁned as the cross product of d copies of the interval [0, 1] with the identiﬁcation of the
end points. To avoid confusion, we use the notation Id to denote the standard unit d-cube [0, 1]d.

For 0 < p ≤ ∞ and r > 0, denote by W r
p , 1

smoothness r. If 1 < p < ∞ and max( 1
B-spline series

p the Sobolev-type space of functions on Td having uniform mixed
2 ) < r < ℓ − 1, then every function f ∈ W r
p can be represented as

f = Xk∈Zd

qk(f ) = Xk∈Zd

converging in the norm of W r
p , where the coeﬃcient functionals ck,s(f ) are explicitly constructed as linear
combinations of at most m0 of function values of f for some m0 ∈ N which is independent of k, s and f , Nk,s
are the tensor product of integer translates of dyadic scaled periodic B-splines (see Subsection 2.1 for details),
and

I(k) := {s ∈ Zd

+ : sj = 0, 1, ..., 2kj − 1, j ∈ [d]}.

Moreover, for this representation there holds the norm equivalence

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
(cid:18)Xk∈Zd

(1.3)

Let Xn = {xj}n

j=1 a family of n functions on Id. If f is a function
on Td, for approximately recovering f from the sampled values f (x1), ..., f (xn), we deﬁne the linear sampling
algorithm Ln(Xn, Φn, ·) by

j=1 be a set of n points in Td, Φn = {ϕj}n

Ln(Xn, Φn, f ) :=

f (xj )ϕj.

Xj=1

(1.4)

Let B be a (quasi-)normed space of functions on Td. For f ∈ B, we measure the recovery error by kf −
Ln(Xn, Φn, f )kB. Let W ⊂ B. To study optimality of linear sampling algorithms of the form (1.4) for recovering
f ∈ W from n of their values, we will use the sampling width

rn(W, B) := inf

Xn,Φn

sup
f ∈W

kf − Ln(Xn, Φn, f )kB.

Related to the sampling width is the linear n-width which is deﬁned by

λn(W, B) := inf
Λn

sup
f ∈W

kf − Λn(f )kB,

where the inﬁmum is taken over all linear operators Λn of rank n in B. This approximation characterization
was introduced by Tikhomirov [42]. The inequality

rn(W, B) ≥ λn(W, B).

(1.5)

is an eﬃcient tool for the lower estimate of rn(W, B) if λn(W, B) is known.

Denote by U r

p the unit ball in the space W r

p . Signiﬁcant results of the present paper are the following

asymptotic orders for r > 1/2,

rn(U r

2 , L2) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(log n)(d−1)/2,

(cid:19)r

and for 1 < p < q < ∞ and r > max( 1

p , 1

2 ),

rn(U r

p , Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−1/p+1/q

.

(1.6)

(1.7)

The result (1.6) and the particular case of (1.7) where 1 < p < 2 < q < ∞, are solutions to ones of the
outstanding open problems in approximation of functions having mixed smoothness which have been unsolved
since 1963 from the ﬁrst paper by Smolyak [37] on sampling recovery of functions having mixed smoothness
(see [19, Introduction]). The proof of the lower bound is the most diﬃcult requires a new idea and technique
(see Subsection 4.2 for more comments). Moreover, in these cases the asymptotic order of rn(U r
p , Lq) strictly
bigger than the asymptotic order of the linear width [22] for r > 1/2,

λn(U r

2 , L2) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r

,

and for 1 < p < q < ∞ and r > max( 1

2 ),

λn(U r

p , Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−max(1/p−1/2,1/2−1/q)

.

It was also to notice that the asymptotic order (1.6) is the ﬁrst result for which p = q: all the previous results on
the asymptotic order of sampling width rn in the Lq-norm of classes of functions of mixed smoothness bounded
in the Lp-norm, are obtained only for some particular cases of p, q with the strict inequality 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ∞.

For 1 < p, q < ∞, we also obtained the asymptotic order of rn(U r

2 ),
1 , Lq) with r > 1. These results on linear widths of the Sobolev classes together with
p , Lq) with some restriction on the smoothness r, except

p , L∞) with r > max( 1

p , 1

1 , Lq) and λn(U r

and rn(U r
known results closes the problem of linear width λn(U r
the four end cases p, q = 1, ∞.

The proof of the upper bounds in (1.6) and (1.7) is based in the B-spline quasi-interpolation representation
(1.1) with norm equivalence (1.3), and linear sampling algorithms on Smolyak grids as partial sums of the series
in (1.1) which is constructed as follows. For m ∈ N, the well known periodic Smolyak grid of points Gd(m) ⊂ Td
is deﬁned as

Gd(m) := {y = 2−ks : k ∈ Nd, |k|1 = m, s ∈ I(k)}.

Here and in what follows, we use the notations: Z+ := {s ∈ Z : s ≥ 0}; xy := (x1y1, ..., xdyd); 2x := (2x1, ..., 2xd);
i=1 |xi| for x, y ∈ Rd; [n] denotes the set of all natural numbers from 1 to n; xi denotes the ith

coordinate of x ∈ Rd, i.e., x := (x1, ..., xd). For m ∈ Z+, we deﬁne the operator Rm by

|x|1 := Pd

Rm(f ) := X|k|1≤m

qk(f ) = X|k|1≤m Xs∈I(k)

ck,s(f ) Nk,s.

For functions f on Td, Rm deﬁnes the linear sampling algorithm on the Smolyak grid Gd(m)

Rm(f ) = Ln(Yn, Φn, f ) = Xy∈G(m)

f (y)ψy,

where n := |Gd(m)|, Yn := {y ∈ G(m)}, Φn := {ϕy}y∈G(m) and for y = 2−ks, ϕy are explicitly constructed
as linear combinations of at most at most m0 B-splines Nk,j for some m0 ∈ N which is independent of k, s, m
and f .

The sparse grids Gd(m) for sampling recovery and numerical integration were ﬁrst considered by Smolyak
[37]. In [38]–[41] and [10]–[12] Smolyak’s construction was developed for studying the sampling recovery and
sampling width for periodic Sobolev classes and Nikol’skii classes having mixed smoothness. Recently, the
sampling recovery for periodic Sobolev and Besov classes having mixed smoothness has been investigated in
[5, 34, 44]. For non-periodic functions of mixed smoothness linear sampling algorithms on Smolyak grids have
been recently studied in [43] (d = 2), [17, 35], using the mixed tensor product B-splines. The ﬁrst asymptotic
order of sampling width

rn(U r

p,∞, Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−1/p+1/q

(log n)(d−1)/q,

1 < p < q ≤ 2, r > 1/p,

among classes of mixed smoothness was obtained in [10, 11] where U r
smoothness r. For Sobolev classes of mixed smoothness, the ﬁrst asymptotic order of sampling width

p,∞ is the Nikol’skii class of uniform mixed

rn(U r

2 , L∞) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−1/2

(log n)(d−1)/2

was obtained in [40].

In numerical applications for approximation problems involving a large number of variables, Smolyak grids
was ﬁrst considered in [46]. For non-periodic functions of mixed smoothness of integer order, linear sampling

3

algorithms on Smolyak grids have been investigated in [4] employing hierarchical Lagrangian polynomials multi-
level basis. There is a very large number of papers on Smolyak grids and their modiﬁcations in various problems
of approximations, sampling recovery and integration with applications in data mining, mathematical ﬁnance,
learning theory, numerical solving of PDE and stochastic PDE, etc. to mention all of them. The reader can see
the surveys in [4, 31, 25] and the references therein.

Quasi-interpolation based on scaled B-splines with integer knots and constructed from function values at
dyadic lattices, possesses good local and approximation properties for smooth functions, see [9, p. 63–65],
[8, p. 100-107].
It can be an eﬃcient tool in some high-dimensional approximation problems, especially in
applications ones. Thus, one of the important bases for sparse grid high-dimensional approximations having
various applications, are the Faber functions (hat functions) which are piecewise linear B-splines of second order
[4, 25, 27, 26, 28, 24, 3]. The representation by Faber basis can be obtained by the B-spline quasi-interpolation
(see, e. g., [17]).

A central role in sampling recovery of functions having a mixed, or more generally an anisotropic smoothness
play sampling representations which are based on dyadic scaled B-splines with integer knots or trigonometric
kernels and constructed from function values at dyadic lattices. These representations are in the form of a
B-spline or trigonometric polynomial series provided with discrete equivalent norm for functions in H¨older-
Nikol’skii- and Besov-types spaces of a mixed smoothness. By employing them we can construct sampling
algorithms for recovery on Smolyak-type grids of functions from the corresponding spaces which in some cases
give the asymptotically optimal rate of the approximation error. While the quasi-interpolation and trigonometric
sampling representation theorems are already established for H¨older-Nikol’skii- and Besov-types spaces of a
mixed smoothness [11, 14, 17, 18], they are almost not formulated for Sobolev-type spaces of a mixed smoothness.
Only a few particular cases are known for a small uniform mixed smoothness [7, 43]. The relations (1.1) and (1.3)
present a Littlewood-Paley-type theorem on B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representation for periodic
Sobolev-type spaces of arbitrary uniform mixed smoothness. A trigonometric counterpart of this theorem has
been investigated in [6].

Finally, we refer the reader to the survey [19] for various aspects, recent development and bibliography on

sampling recovery of functions having mixed smoothness and related problems.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling repre-
sentation for continuous functions on Td, and prove an explicit formula for the coeﬃcient functionals in this
representation. In Section 3, we prove direct and inverse Littlewood-Paley-type theorem for Sobolev spaces W r
p .
In Section 4, For Sobolev c lasses U r
p , we investigate the sampling recovery in Lq-norm by linear sampling algo-
rithms induced by partial sums of B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representation, optimality of sampling
recovery on Smolyak grids and the asymptotic order of rn(U r

p , Lq) and λn(U r

p , Lq).

2 B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representations

2.1 B-spline quasi-interpolations and sampling representations

In order to construct B-spline quasi-interpolation sampling representations for continuous functions on Td, we
preliminarily introduce quasi-interpolation operators for functions on Rd. For a given natural number ℓ, denote
by Mℓ the cardinal B-spline of order ℓ with support [0, ℓ] and knots at the points 0, 1, ..., ℓ. We ﬁxed an even
number ℓ ∈ N and take the cardinal B-spline M := Mℓ of even order ℓ. Let Λ = {λ(s)}|j|≤µ be a given ﬁnite
even sequence, i.e., λ(−j) = λ(j) for some µ ≥ ℓ
2 − 1. We deﬁne the linear operator Q for functions f on R by

Q(f, x) := Xs∈Z

Λ(f, s)M (x − s),

where

Λ(f, s) := X|j|≤µ

λ(j)f (s − j + ℓ/2).

4

(2.1)

(2.2)

The operator Q is local and bounded in C(R) (see [8, p. 100–109]). An operator Q of the form (2.1)–(2.2) is
called a quasi-interpolation operator in C(R) if it reproduces Pℓ−1, i.e., Q(f ) = f for every f ∈ Pℓ−1, where
Pℓ−1 denotes the set of d-variate polynomials of degree at most ℓ − 1 in each variable.

If Q is a quasi-interpolation operator of the form (2.1)–(2.2), for h > 0 and a function f on R, we deﬁne
the operator Q(·; h) by Q(f ; h) := σh ◦ Q ◦ σ1/h(f ), where σh(f, x) = f (x/h). Let Q be a quasi-interpolation
operator of the form (2.1)–(2.2) in C(R). If k ∈ Z+, we introduce the operator Qk by

Qk(f, x) := Q(f, x; h(k)), x ∈ R,

h(k) := ℓ−12−k.

We deﬁne the integer translated dilation Mk,s of M by

Mk,s(x) := M (ℓ2kx − s), k ∈ Z+, s ∈ Z.

Then we have for k ∈ Z+,

Qk(f )(x) = Xs∈Z

ak,s(f )Mk,s(x), ∀x ∈ R,

where the coeﬃcient functional ak,s is deﬁned by

ak,s(f ) := Λ(f, s; h(k)) = X|j|≤µ

λ(j)f (h(k)(s − j + r)).

Notice that Qk(f ) can be written in the form:

Qk(f )(x) = Xs∈Z

f (h(k)(s + r))Lk(x − s), ∀x ∈ R,

where the function Lk is deﬁned by

Lk := = X|j|≤µ

λ(j)Mk,j .

From (2.4) and (2.5) we get for a function f on R,

kQk(f )kC(R) ≤ kLΛkC(R)kf kC(R) ≤ kΛkkf kC(R),

where

LΛ(x) := = Xs∈Z X|j|≤µ

λ(j)M (x − j − s),

kΛk = X|j|≤µ

|λ(j)|.

For k ∈ Zd

+, let the mixed operator Qk be deﬁned by

Qk :=

Qki,

d

Yi=1

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

where the univariate operator Qki is applied to the univariate function f by considering f as a function of
variable xi with the other variables held ﬁxed. We deﬁne the d-variable B-spline Mk,s by

Mk,s(x) :=

d

Yi=1

Mki,si(xi), k ∈ Zd

+, s ∈ Zd,

where Zd

+ := {s ∈ Zd : si ≥ 0, i ∈ [d]}. Then we have

Qk(f, x) = Xs∈Zd

ak,s(f )Mk,s(x),

∀x ∈ Rd,

5

(2.9)

where Mk,s is the mixed B-spline deﬁned in (2.9), and

ak,s(f ) = (cid:18) d
Yj=1

akj ,sj(cid:19)(f ),

(2.10)

and the univariate coeﬃcient functional aki,si is applied to the univariate function f by considering f as a
function of variable xi with the other variables held ﬁxed.

Since M (ℓ 2kx) = 0 for every k ∈ Z+ and x /∈ (0, 1), we can extend the univariate B-spline M (ℓ 2k·) to an

1-periodic function on the whole R. Denote this periodic extension by Nk and deﬁne

Nk,s(x) := Nk(x − s), k ∈ Z+, s ∈ I(k),

where I(k) := {0, 1, ..., ℓ2k − 1}. We deﬁne the d-variable B-spline Nk,s by

d

Nki,si (xi), k ∈ Zd

+, s ∈ I(k),

Nk,s(x) :=

Yi=1
where I(k) :=Qd

Qk(f, x) = Xs∈I(k)

i=1 I(ki). Then we have for functions f on Td,

ak,s(f )Nk,s(x),

∀x ∈ Td.

(2.11)

(2.12)

Since the function LΛ deﬁned in (2.7) is 1-periodic, from (2.6) it follows that for a function f on T,

kQk(f )kC(T) ≤ kLΛkC(T)kf kC(T) ≤ kΛkkf kC(T),

For k ∈ Zd

+, we write k → ∞ if ki → ∞ for i ∈ [d]). In a way similar to the proof of [18, Lemma 2.2] one

can show that for every f ∈ C(Td),

kf − Qk(f )kC(Td) ≤ C Xu⊂[d], u6=∅

ωu
ℓ (f, 2−k),

and, consequently,

kf − Qk(f )kC(Td) → 0, k → ∞.

(2.13)

For convenience we deﬁne the univariate operator Q−1 by putting Q−1(f ) = 0 for all f on I. Let the

operators qk be deﬁned in the manner of the deﬁnition (2.8) by

qk :=

d

Yi=1(cid:18)Qki − Qki−1(cid:19), k ∈ Zd

+.

(2.14)

From the equation Qk = Pk′≤k qk′ and (2.13) it is easy to see that a continuous function f has the

qk(f ) with the convergence in the norm of C(Td). From the reﬁnement equation

+

for the B-spline M , in the univariate case, we can represent the component functions qk(f ) as

decomposition f = Pk∈Zd

qk(f ) = Xs∈I(k)

ck,s(f )Nk,s,

(2.15)

where ck,s are certain coeﬃcient functionals of f . In the multivariate case, the representation (2.15) holds true
with the ck,s which are deﬁned in the manner of the deﬁnition (2.10) by

ck,s(f ) = (cid:18) d
Yj=1

ckj ,sj(cid:19)(f ).

See [17] for details. Thus, we have proven the following periodic B-spline quasi-interpolation representation for
continuous functions on Td.

Lemma 2.1 Every continuous function f on Td is represented as B-spline series

f = Xk∈Zd

+

qk(f ) = Xk∈Zd

+ Xs∈I(k)

ck,s(f )Nk,s,

(2.16)

converging in the norm of C(Td), where the coeﬃcient functionals ck,s(f ) are explicitly constructed as linear
combinations of at most m0 of function values of f for some m0 ∈ N which is independent of k, s and f .

2.2 A formula for the coeﬃcients in B-spline quasi-interpolation representations

In this subsection, we ﬁnd an explicit formula for the coeﬃcients ck,s(f ) in the representation (2.16) which plays
an important role in the proof of a direct theorem of sampling representation of functions in the Sobolev space
W r
p .

If h ∈ Rd, we deﬁne the shift operator Th for functions f on Td by Th(f ) := f (· + h). Recall that a d-variate

Laurent polynomial is call a function P of the form

P (z) = Xs∈A

cszs,

(2.17)

where A is a ﬁnite subset in Zd and zs :=Qd

operator T [P ]

h by

j=1 zsj

j . A d-variate Laurent polynomial P as (2.17) generates the

T [P ]

h (f ) = Xs∈A

csTsh(f ).

(2.18)

Sometimes we also write T [P ]
operation over operators T [P ]

h = T [P (z)]
h . Thus, in particular, we have

h

. Notice that any operation over polynomials generates a corresponding

We say that a d-variate polynomial is a tensor product polynomial if it is of the form P (z) = Qd

where Pj (zj) are univariate polynomial in variable zj.

j=1 Pj(zj),

Lemma 2.2 Let P be a tensor product Laurent polynomial, h ∈ Rd with hj 6= 0, and ℓ ∈ N. Assume that
T [P ]
h (g) = 0 for every polynomial g ∈ Pℓ−1 Then P has a factor Dℓ and consequently,

T [P ]

h

◦ ∆ℓ

h, P (z) = Dℓ(z)P ∗(z),

where P ∗ is a tensor product Laurent polynomial.

by induction on l. Let P (z) = Pn

Proof. By the tensor product argument it is enough to prove the lemma for the case d = 1. We prove this case
s=−m cszs for some m, n ∈ Z+. Consider ﬁrst the case l = 1. Assume that
T [P ]
h (g) = 0 for every constant functions g. Then replacing by g0 = 1 in (2.18) we get T [P ]
s=−m cs =
0. By B´ezout’s theorem P has a factor (z − 1). This proves the lemma for l = 1. Assume it is true for l − 1 and
T [P ]
h (g) = 0 for every polynomial g of degree at most l − 1. By the induction assumption we have

h (g0) = Pn

T [P ]
h = T [P1]

h

◦ ∆l−1

h , P (z) := (z − 1)l−1P1(z).

(2.19)

7

We take a proper polynomial gl of degree l − 1 (with the nonzero eldest coeﬃcient). Hence ψl = ∆l−1
h (gl) = a
where a is a nonzero constant. Similarly to the case l = 1, from the equations 0 = T [P ]
h (gl) = T [P1]
(ψl) we
conclude that P1 has a factor (z − 1). Hence, by (2.19) we can see that P has a factor (z − 1)l. The lemma is
proved.

Let us return to the deﬁnition of quasi-interpolation operator Q of the form (2.1) induced by the sequence

Λ as in (2.2) which can be uniquely characterized by the univariate symmetric Laurent polynomial

PΛ(z) := zℓ/2 X|s|≤µ

λ(s)zs.

Let the d-variate symmetric tensor product Laurent polynomial PΛ be given by

PΛ(z) :=

For the periodic quasi-interpolation operator

qk(f ) = Xs∈I(k)

ak,s(f )Nk,s

given as in (2.11), from (2.3) we get

ak,s(f ) = T [PΛ]

h(k) (f )(sh(k)).

Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd an explicit formula for the univariate operator Qk(f ). We have for k > 0,

(2.20)

Qk(f ) = Xs∈I(k)

min(1, 2ℓmi) max(1, 2νmi),

∀x ∈ Td, ∀k ∈ Zd

(3.11)

We ﬁrst obtain the univariate case of this inequality which is of the form

q∗
k(fk+m)(x) ≪ P2k+m,ν(fk+m, x) min(1, 2ℓm) max(1, 2νm),

∀x ∈ T, ∀k ∈ Z+, ∀m ∈ Z.

(3.12)

from the inequality for every k ∈ Z+,

|q∗

k(fk+m)(x)| ≪ |ck,s(fk+m)|,

∀x ∈ σ(k, s), ∀s ∈ I ∗(k).

(3.13)

Let x ∈ T and k ∈ Z+ be given. Then by (3.9) there is a s ∈ I ∗(k) such that x ∈ σ(k, s). Notice that
|x − sh(k)| ≤ 2−k. If k = 0, then by Lemma 2.3 we have

c0,s(fk+m) = T [PΛ]

h(0) (fk+m)(sh(0)),

and therefore,

|ck,s(fk+m)| ≪ |fk+m(sh(0))| ≤ sup
|y|≤1

|fk+m(x + y)| ≤ sup
|y|≤1

If k > 0, by Lemma 2.3 we have

Notice that for a continuous function g and a ≥ 0,

P2k,ν(g, x) ≤ 2νaP2k+a,ν(g, x).

All these together give

|ck,s(fk+m)| ≪ P2k,ν(fk+m, x) ≤ 2νmP2k+m,ν(fk+m, x),

∀m ≥ 0.

(3.14)

(3.15)

On the other hand, if m ≥ −k we have by Lemma 3.5 another estimate the trigonometric polynomial fk+m of
degree 2k+m,

|ck,s(fk+m)| ≪ |∆ℓ

h(k) (fk+m)(sh(k))|

≪ min(1, |2k+mh(k)|ℓ) max(1, |2k+mh(k)|ν ) P2k+m,ν(fk+m, sh(k)).

Hence, there holds the inequality

|ck,s(fk+m)| ≪ 2ℓm P2k+m,ν(fk+m, x),

∀m < 0.

Indeed, if m < 0 and m + k ≥ 0,

P2k+m,ν(fk+m, sh(k)) = sup
y∈T

|fk+m(sh(k) + y)|
(1 + 2k+m|y|)ν = sup

y∈T

|fk+m(x + y)|

(1 + 2k+m|sh(k) − x + y|)ν .

Since |x − sh(k)| ≤ 2−k, we have for all m < 0,

1 + 2k+m|sh(k) − x + y| ≥ 1 + 2k+m(|y| − |sh(k) − x|) ≥

(1 + 2k+m+1(|y|),

and consequently, by (3.14),

P2k+m,ν(fk+m, sh(k)) ≤ 2 sup
y∈T

|fk+m(x + y)|
(1 + 2k+m+1|y|)ν ≤ 4P2k+m,ν(fk+m, x)

(3.16)

(3.17)

which together with the equation h(k) = ℓ−12−k and (3.16) proves (3.17) m < 0 and m + k ≥ 0. In the case
m < 0 and m + k < 0, (3.17) is trivial because by deﬁnition fk+m = 0. By combining (3.13), (3.15) and (3.15)
we prove (3.12). The d-variate inequality (3.10) can be easily derived from the univariate inequality (3.12) by
a tensor product argument.

We are now in position to estimate Am(f ). Indeed, putting for m ∈ Zd,

bm :=

bmi,

d

Yi=1

bmi := (2(ℓ−r)mi,

2(ν−r)mi,

if mi < 0;

Let I ∗(k + m; x) be the subset in I ∗(k + m) of all s such that |x − s2−k−m| ≤ ℓ2−k if k + m ≥ 0, and
I ∗(k + m; x) = ∅ if k + m < 0. Then from the equation

For m ∈ Z+, we deﬁne the operator Rm by

Rm(f ) := X|k|1≤m

qk(f ) = X|k|1≤m Xs∈I(k)

ck,s(f ) Nk,s.

For functions f on Td, Rm deﬁnes the linear sampling algorithm on the Smolyak grid Gd(m)

Rm(f ) = Sn(Yn, Φn, f ) = Xy∈G(m)

f (y)ψy,

where n := |Gd(m)|, Yn := {y ∈ G(m)}, Φn := {ϕy}y∈G(m) and for y = 2−ks, ϕy are explicitly constructed
as linear combinations of at most at most m0 B-splines Nk,j for some m0 ∈ N which is independent of k, s, m
and f .

p with g(y) = 0, ∀y ∈ Gd(m), and then estimate from below the norm

g1 := C12−rmm−(d−1)/2 X|k|1=m Xs∈∈I ∗(k)

Nk,s

with a constant C1. Here Nk,s are the d-variate periodic B-splines of ℓ. By the construction one can verify that
g1(y) = 0, ∀y ∈ Gd(m). By applying Theorem 3.2 and the inequality

∀x ∈ Td,

(4.8)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Xs∈∈I ∗(k)

we can see that g1 ∈ U r

This proves the lower bound of the case p ≥ q. For the case p < q, we take a k∗ with |k∗|1 = m and a s∗ ∈ I ∗(k),
and consider the test function

g2 := C22−(r−1/p)mNk∗,s∗

with a constant C2. Similarly to the function g1, we have g2(y) = 0, ∀y ∈ Gd(m), and g2 ∈ U r

4.2 Sampling width

Lemma 4.1 Let r > 0 and 0 < p, p∗, τ ≤ ∞ be such that 1/p + 1/p∗ = 2/τ . Let B be a quasi-normed space of

functions on Td provided the quasi-triangle inequality kf + gkB ≤ C(cid:0)kf + gkB + kf + gkB(cid:1). Then we have

and

(4.12)

Proof. We will prove the relation (4.11). The relation (4.12) can be proven in a similar way with a slight
modiﬁcation. To prove (4.11) we adopt an idea in the proof of the inequality [40, (2.16)]. Without loss of
generality we can assume that p ≤ τ and B is a normed space. Let f be an arbitrary function in U r
τ and
f = Fr ∗ ϕ for some ϕ ∈ Lτ . By the deﬁnition kϕkτ = kf kW r

τ ≤ 1. For arbitrary δ > 0 we put

Theorem 4.3 Let 1 < p < q < ∞ and r > max( 1

rn(U r

p , Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1/p+1/q)

.

(4.13)

Proof. The upper bound of (4.13) already is in Corollary 4.1. We will separately prove the lower bound for the
diﬀerent cases:

(i) 1 < p < q ≤ 2;

(ii) 2 ≤ p < q < ∞;

(iii) 1 < p < 2 < q < ∞ and 1/p + 1/q < 1;

(iv) 1 < p < 2 < q < ∞ and 1/p + 1/q ≥ 1.

The cases (i) and (ii) follow from (1.5) and the inequality

λn(U r

p , Lq) ≫ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1/p+1/q)

(4.14)

proven in [22] (see also [23]).

The case (iii) is derived from the lower bound of rn(U r
p′ , Lq) given by Corollary 4.1, and the inequality (4.11) in Lemma 4.1 for B = Lq:

2 , Lq) proven in the case (ii), and the upper bound of

rn(U r

rn(U r

2 , Lq)2 ≤ 4rn(U r

p , Lq) · rn(U r

p′ , Lq)

provided 1/p + 1/p′ = 1 (p∗ = p′). Indeed, since 2 < q < ∞ and 1 < p′ < q < ∞, we have

(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/2+1/q)

≪ rn(U r

p , Lq) ·(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−1+1/p+1/q

which immediately implies the lower bound for the case (iii).

25

Finally, we treat the case (iv). It is convenient to consider the pairs (1/p, 1/q) in this case as the points in
the triangle D in R2 with vertexes (1, 0), (1, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2). For every m ∈ N, let Dm be the subset in D
of all points (1/p, 1/q) satisfying the additional condition

1
p

+

2m+1 − 1

q

< 2m.

We preliminarily prove by induction on m the lower bound for every pair (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm. We ﬁrst prove it for
m = 1. Denote by D1(ξ) the subset in D1 given by the inequalities

1
p

.

Notice that D1(ξ) is the triangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, 1 − ξ/2) and (ξ/2, 1 − ξ/2) for 4/3 ≤ ξ ≤ 3/2, and the
rectangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, ξ − 1), (3ξ/2 − 1, 1 − ξ/2) and (ξ/2, 1 − ξ/2) for 1 < ξ < 4/3. On the other
hand, D1 is the triangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, 2/3) and (1/2, 1/2) which is given by the inequalities

1
p

+

1
q

≥ 1,

1

3
q

< 2,

1
p

< 1.

Hence, one can check that

D1 = ∪1<ξ≤3/2D1(ξ).

(4.15)

Due to the relation (4.15), it suﬃcient to prove the lower bound for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ D1(ξ) and every
1 < ξ ≤ 3/2. For given (1/p, 1/q) ∈ D1(ξ) and 1 < ξ ≤ 3/2, we deﬁne τ := 2/ξ and p∗ by the equation
1/p + 1/p∗ = 2/τ . Applying the inequality (4.11) in Lemma 4.1 for B = Lq give

rn(U r

τ , Lq)2 ≤ 4rn(U r

p , Lq) · rn(U r

p∗ , Lq).

Since 1 < p∗ < q < ∞, by Corollary 4.1 we have

rn(U r

p∗ , Lq) ≪ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−ξ+1/p+1/q

.

On the other hand, due to the inequality 1/τ + 1/q < 1, we can estimate the lower bound of rn(U r
the case (iii):

τ , Lq) as in

rn(U r

τ , Lq) ≫ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/τ +1/q)

.

Summing up, we obtain

(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/τ +1/q)

≪ rn(U r

p , Lq) ·(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−ξ+1/p+1/q

which immediately implies the lower bound for for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ D1(ξ) and every 1 < ξ ≤ 3/2.

In the next step, assuming that the lower bound holds true for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm−1, we prove it for

(1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm. Denote by Dm(ξ) the subset in Dm given by the inequalities

1
p

+

1
q

≥ 1,

1
p

+

1
q

1 − am(ξ) <

1
q

< am(ξ),

where

am(ξ) :=

2m−1
2m − 1

−

ξ

2(2m − 1)

.

Notice that Dm(ξ) is the triangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, am(ξ)) and (1− am(ξ), am(ξ)) for 1+ 2m−1
and the rectangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, ξ−1), (ξ− am(ξ), am(ξ)) and (1− am(ξ), am(ξ)) for 1 < ξ < 1+ 2m−1

2m+1−1 ≤ ξ ≤ 3/2,
2m+1−1 .

26

On the other hand, Dm is the triangle with vertexes (1, 0), (1, 2m−1
inequalities

2m+1−1 ) and (1/2, 1/2) which is given by the

1
p

+

1
q

≥ 1,

1
p

+

2m+1 − 1

q

< 2m,

1
p

< 1.

Hence, it is easy to check that

Dm = ∪1<ξ≤3/2Dm(ξ),

(4.16)

Due to the relation (4.16), it suﬃcient to prove the lower bound for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm(ξ) and every
1 < ξ ≤ 3/2. For given (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm(ξ) and 1 < ξ ≤ 3/2, we deﬁne τ := 2/ξ and p∗ by the equation
1/p + 1/p∗ = 2/τ . Applying the inequality (4.11) in Lemma 4.1 for B = Lq give

rn(U r

τ , Lq)2 ≤ 4rn(U r

p , Lq) · rn(U r

p∗ , Lq).

Since 1 < p∗ < q < ∞, by Corollary 4.1 we have

rn(U r

p∗ , Lq) ≪ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−ξ+1/p+1/q

.

On the other hand, due to the inclusion (1/τ, 1/q) ∈ Dm−1, we can estimate the lower bound of rn(U r
the induction assumption:

τ , Lq) by

rn(U r

τ , Lq) ≫ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/τ +1/q)

.

Summing up, we obtain

(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/τ +1/q)

≪ rn(U r

p , Lq) ·(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−ξ+1/p+1/q

which immediately implies the lower bound for for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm(ξ) and every 1 < ξ ≤ 3/2, and
consequently, by (4.16) for every (1/p, 1/q) ∈ Dm.

To ﬁnish the proof of the lower bound in the case (iv), where (1/p, 1/q) ∈ D, we notice that

D = ∪m∈NDm.

We will need Ismagilov’s duality theorem [29] which states that for r > 0 and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞ there holds true

the relation

λn(U r

p , Lq) = λn(U r

q′ , Lp′ )

provided 1/p + 1/p′ = 1 and 1/q + 1/q′ = 1.

(4.17)

Theorem 4.4 Let 1 < p < ∞ and r > max( 1

p , 1

2 ). Then we have

rn(U r

p , L∞) ≍ λn(U r

p , L∞) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1/p)

(log n)(d−1)(1−1/p).

(4.18)

Proof. Due to the inequality (1.5) it is suﬃcient to prove the upper bound for rn(U r
p , L∞) and the lower bound
for λn(U r
p , L∞). The upper bound of (4.18) is easily derived from Theorem 4.2 by considering special values
of n = |Gd(m)| ≍ 2mmd−1. The lower bound for the case p = 2 follows from the particular case of (4.17)
λn(U r

1 , L2) and the inequalities

2 , L∞) = λn(U r

λn(U r

1 , L2) ≥ dn(U r

n

(log n)(d−1)/2,

(4.19)

(cid:19)(r−1/p)

27

where dn(W, B) denotes the Kolmogorov n-width of the set W in the normed space B. The second inequality
in (4.19) was proven in [39]. Let us prove the lower bound for the case p 6= 2. The proof is based on the upper
bound of λn(U r

2 , L∞) and the inequality (4.12) in Lemma 4.1 B = L∞:

p′, L∞), the lower bound of λn(U r

λn(U r

2 , L∞)2 ≤ 4λn(U r

p , L∞) · λn(U r

p′ , L∞)

provided 1/p + 1/p′ = 1 (p∗ = p′). Indeed, we have

(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2(r−1/2)

(log n)(d−1) ≪ λn(U r

p , L∞) ·(cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1+1/p)

(log n)(d−1)/p

which immediately implies the lower bound for λn(U r

p , L∞) in (4.18).

Theorem 4.5 Let 1 < q < ∞ and r > 1. Then we have

rn(U r

1 , Lq) ≍ λn(U r

1 , Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1+1/q)

(log n)(d−1)/q.

(4.20)

(4.21)

Proof. This corollary follows from Theorem 4.4 and the particular case of (4.17) λn(U r
1/q + 1/q′ = 1.

1 , Lq) = λn(U r

q′ , L∞) with

Notice that for r > 0 and 1 < p, q < ∞, from the known result [32]

λn(U r

p , L1) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r

and the particular case of (4.17) λn(U r

∞, Lq) = λn(U r

q′ , L1) with 1/q + 1/q′ = 1, it follows that

λn(U r

∞, Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r

.

The last two asymptotic orders together with the results in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 on linear widths of the
p , Lq) with

Sobolev classes together with the other known results [22] close the problem of linear width λn(U r
some restriction on the smoothness r, except the four end cases p, q = 1, ∞.

Denote by U r

p,θ the unit ball in the space Br

p,θ.

Corollary 4.4 Let 1 < q < ∞ and r > 1. Then we have

rn(U r

1,∞, Lq) ≍ λn(U r

1,∞, Lq) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)(r−1+1/q)

(log n)(d−1)/q.

(4.22)

Proof. Due to the inequality (1.5) it is suﬃcient to prove the upper bound for rn(U r
bound for λn(U r
λn(U r

1,∞, Lq) and the lower
1,∞, Lq) proven in [17, Theorem 3.3]. The lower bound for
1,∞ and the lower bound of λn(U r

1,∞, Lq). The upper bound for rn(U r
1 ֒→ Br

1,∞, Lq) follows from the embedding W r

1 , Lq) in Theorem 4.5.

Theorem 4.6 Let r > 1/2. Then we have

rn(U r

2 , L2) ≍ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(log n)(d−1)/2.

(cid:19)r

(4.23)

Proof. The upper bound of (4.23) already is in Corollary 4.1. We prove the lower bound. By the inequality
(4.11) in Lemma 4.1 for B = L∞ for B = L2, p = 2, p∗ = 2/3 and τ = 1, and Lemma 3.3 we have

rn(U r

1 , L2)2 ≤ 4rn(U r

2 , L2) · rn(U r

2/3, L2) ≪ rn(U r

2 , L2) · rn(U r

2/3,∞, L2).

28

Since 0 < 2/3 < 2 < ∞, from [17, Theorem 3.3] we derive that

rn(U r

2/3,∞, L2) ≪ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−3/2+1/2

(log n)(d−1)/2 = (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)r−1

(log n)(d−1)/2.

On the other hand, by Theorem 4.5,

rn(U r

1 , L2)2 ≫ (cid:18) (log n)d−1

n

(cid:19)2r−1

(log n)d−1.

Summing up, we obtain the lower bound of (4.23).

Final remarks. All the results in this paper can be in a natural way extended to the Sobolev space W r
class U r
