In a recent work, the dependence of the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect on the shape
of the fast, weak pulse was investigated and shown to exhibit signiﬁcant, qualitative diﬀerences
between, for example, a Sauter pulse 1/ cosh(ωt)2 and a Gaussian exp(−ω2t2). These results are
now extended to include the subleading ﬂuctuation prefactor.

INTRODUCTION

In [1] the impact of diﬀerent pulse shapes on the
dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger mechanism has
been compared. The Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect is a strik-
ing phenomenon predicted by Quantum Electrodynam-
ics (QED), that describes non-perturbative pair cre-
ation from the QED vacuum by a strong electromagnetic
ﬁeld [2–5]. So far, experimental veriﬁcation has not been
possible, due to the extremely high critical ﬁeld strength
ES = m2/q ≈ 1.3 × 1018 V/m ˆ= 4.6 × 1029 W/cm2 where
pair production is expected for a uniform, static electric
ﬁeld.

An extension that can signiﬁcantly lower this threshold
is dynamical assistance [6], where an additional weak,
time dependent ﬁeld with ¯hω (cid:28) 2mc2 is superimposed
onto a static ﬁeld.

In the following, we will apply the worldline instan-
ton method [7–13] to calculate the full pair production
rate (i.e. the exponent and the prefactor) in the dynami-
cally assisted Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect for diﬀerent shapes
of time dependent pulses. Section II will give a sum-
mary of the method, which is then used in section III to
yield both numerical results without any further approx-
imations and analytical estimates in certain parameter
regions.

II. WORLDLINE INSTANTON METHOD

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy review the worldline instanton
method. For a detailed derivation see, e.g. [11, 12]. We
start out with the vacuum persistence amplitude, which
can be expressed using the eﬀective action ΓM,

(cid:104)0out|0in(cid:105) = eiΓM .

(1)

We use the subscript M to indicate Minkowskian quanti-
ties, in contrast to the Euclidean versions we will mostly
be concerned with in the following.

If the eﬀective action were to gain an imaginary part,
the absolute value of the vacuum persistence would devi-
ate from one, which can be interpreted as the probability
amplitude for pair production:

Pe+e− = 1 − |(cid:104)0out|0in(cid:105)|2 ≈ 2(cid:61)ΓM.

(2)

After analytic continuation, the Euclidean eﬀective ac-

tion can be expressed using the worldline path integral

The worldline instanton approach is a semiclassical ap-
proximation to (3), by evaluating both the path integral
and the integral over T using the saddle point method.
For the path integral, we need to ﬁnd a path x(τ ) with

x(T ) = x(0) that extremizes

for a given T . The Euler-Lagrange equations for this
action functional give the equations of motion

¨xµ = iqFµν ˙xν.

(5)

A solution to (5) that satisﬁes the periodicity conditions
is called a world line instanton, in analogy to the instan-
tons in nonrelativistic quantum tunneling [14].

The saddle point approximation includes an additional
prefactor, arising from the ﬂuctuations around the ex-
tremum. For the path integral, this amounts to the de-
terminant of a second order diﬀerential operator [15]. Re-
markably, this determinant can be found using a ﬁnite
determinant comprised of solutions to a certain initial
value problem (for a derivation using methods of com-
plex analysis, see [16]).

Including the ﬂuctuation prefactor, the saddle point

approximation of the path integral in (3) is given by

The ηµ are solutions to the ﬂuctuation equations of mo-
tion and θ is the Morse index [17] of the ﬂuctuation op-
erator (omitted here for brevity).

Let us now restrict ourselves to time dependent, homo-
geneous electric ﬁelds of constant direction. In particular,

we use the Euclidean four-potential

iA3 =

E
ω

f (ωx4),

leading to the electric ﬁeld

(cid:126)E = Ef(cid:48)(iωt)(cid:126)ez.

(7)

(8)

In this case, both the instanton action and the ﬂuc-
tuation determinant can be found, up to quadrature, in
terms of the function f .

The remaining T -integral can be done explicitly using
the saddle point approximation as well. The imaginary
part of the Minkowski eﬀective action is then completely
determined by the single function

g(γ) =

(9)
where γ = mω/qE is the Keldysh parameter and χ∗ is
determined by the implicit equation

dχ

γ = f (γχ∗).

(10)

Using this function, we ﬁnd our ﬁnal expression for the
imaginary part of the eﬀective action, and thus the pair
production rate:

III. DYNAMICALLY ASSISTED
SAUTER-SCHWINGER EFFECT

We now apply (9), (11) and (12) to the dynamically

assisted Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect.

As in [1], we choose the function

f (χ) = χ + εh(χ),

ε (cid:28) 1,

(13)

representing the sum of a strong, slow ﬁeld (in this case
approximated by a static background) and a weak, faster
proﬁle with Eweak/E = ε,

(cid:126)E = E(1 + εh(cid:48)(iωt))(cid:126)ez.

(14)

Note that in this case, the combined Keldysh parameter
γ = mω/qE depends on the frequency ω of the weak
pulse, but on the ﬁeld strength E of the slow, strong
ﬁeld.

In the remainder of this section, we will choose the

2 erﬁ χ

−2(ωt), hSauter(χ) = tan χ

• Sauter cosh
• Lorentzian (1 + ω2t2)−1, hLorentz(χ) = artanh χ

First, we will numerically calculate g(γ) and Φ(γ) (and
thus (cid:61)ΓM) for these pulse shapes h(χ). In section III B
we will then present analytical approximations for the
pair production rate.

A. Numerical evaluation

The eﬀective action (11) can be evaluated straightfor-
wardly using numerical methods. The only challenge is
solving the implicit equation (10), which, for our choice
of f (13) has the form

χ∗ = 1 − ε
γ

h(γχ∗).

For the cosine and Gaussian proﬁles, h is smooth and a
simple root ﬁnding algorithm converges using basically
any choice of starting point. For the other two proﬁles
however, h diverges (at χ = π/2 or χ = 1 respectively),
so for small ε, the starting points for the root ﬁnding
method have to be chosen with some care.
As soon as χ∗ is found, a standard numerical integra-
tion routine can be used to evaluate (9) and (12), yielding
the eﬀective Action (11).

For the spatial volume, we choose a focal region of
V3 = (1 µm)3 and sum the pair production for each of the
fast pulses while the strong ﬁeld is active (an additional
factor of 1 µm/ω−1). The strong ﬁeld has an intensity of
5 × 1026 W/cm2, corresponding to E ≈ ES/30.

Figure 1 shows the results of this procedure.

In all
cases there is a region of relatively weak dependence on
the frequency of the weak ﬁeld and a region of strong
enhancement, as soon as the Keldysh parameter crosses
a threshold value γcrit. For the cosine and Gauss proﬁles,
this threshold depends on ε, while it is approximately
constant for the Sauter and Lorentz pulses. This is the
same behavior as seen in [1] considering the exponent
only, we can now conclude that the prefactor does not
change this qualitatively.

B. Analytical approximations

To ﬁnd analytical expressions for g(γ) and thus Φ(γ)
and (cid:61)ΓM, we can use diﬀerent approaches for γ < γcrit
and γ > γcrit.

following proﬁles for the time dependent pulses:

Below threshold, we can Taylor-expand g(γ) to ﬁrst

For the Sauter proﬁle, it is unfortunately not possible to
ﬁnd a closed form expression for the integral in G(γ), so
we can not give an analytic expression for its subcritical
behavior.
For γ > γcrit however, the function g(γ) can be approx-
imated in the limit ε (cid:28) 1 for the Sauter and Lorentzian
pulses by geometric considerations [6], leading to

Figure 2 shows the numerical calculation of (cid:61)ΓLorentz
for diﬀerent values of ε, the approximations (21) and (22)
for γ < 1 and (24) for γ > 1. Far above threshold, the
pair production rate converges to the approximation (24),
independent of ε. Closer to the threshold, the geometric
approach breaks down for larger values of ε, although for
ε = 10−2 the numerical values agree with the approxi-
mation very well. As expected, the approximation (21)
below threshold works better, the smaller the expansion
parameter ε gets.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Using the worldline instanton method, we have been
able to numerically calculate and ﬁnd analytical approx-
imations for the pair production rate in the dynamically
assisted Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect. Building on [1], this
now includes the quantum mechanical ﬂuctuation pref-
actor, which is shown not to counteract the mechanism
of dynamical assistance.

Comparing the diﬀerent pulse shapes considered, they
all exhibit the same qualitative behavior. This includes
a region of negligible dependence on the time dependent
ﬁeld up to a threshold value of the Keldysh parameter γ,
beyond which the pair production rate is exponentially
enhanced.

This threshold γcrit is independent of ε for the Sauter
and Lorentzian pulses,
in contrast to the sinusoidally
varying ﬁeld and Gaussian pulse which is caused by the
diﬀerent analytic structure of the ﬁeld proﬁles.
