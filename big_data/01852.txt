The prospect of coupling a two-dimensional
(2D) semiconductor heterostructure to a super-
conductor opens new research and technology op-
portunities, including fundamental problems in
mesoscopic superconductivity [1–3], scalable su-
perconducting electronics [4, 5], and new topo-
logical states of matter [6]. For instance, one
route toward realizing topological matter is by
coupling a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with strong
spin-orbit interaction to an s-wave superconduc-
tor [6–8]. Previous eﬀorts along these lines have
been hindered by interface disorder and unsta-
ble gating [9–11]. Here, we report measure-
ments on a gateable InGaAs/InAs 2DEG with
patterned epitaxial Al, yielding multilayer de-
vices with atomically pristine interfaces between
semiconductor and superconductor [12]. Using
surface gates to form a quantum point contact
(QPC), we ﬁnd a hard superconducting gap in the
tunneling regime, overcoming the soft-gap prob-
lem in 2D superconductor/semiconductor hy-
brid systems [13]. With the QPC in the open
regime, we observe a ﬁrst conductance plateau
at 4e2/h, as expected theoretically for a normal-
QPC-superconductor structure [14]. The realiza-
tion of a hard-gap semiconductor-superconductor
system that is amenable to top-down process-
ing provides a means of fabricating scalable mul-
ticomponent hybrid systems for applications in
low-dissipation electronics and topological quan-
tum information.

Recent work on semiconductor nanowires has oﬀered
evidence for the existence of Majorana zero modes, a
signature of the topological superconductivity [15–17].
A characteristic of the ﬁrst studies in this area was
signiﬁcant subgap tunneling conductance (a so-called
soft gap), attributed to disorder at the semiconductor-
superconductor (Sm-S) interface along with dissipation

[13, 18]. In nanowires, the soft-gap problem was recently
resolved by growing Al epitaxially on InAs nanowires,
yielding greatly reduced subgap conductance [19, 20].
Studies of Sm-S systems based on top-down processed
2DEGs have not addressed the soft-gap issue, but have
demonstrated quantization of critical current [21, 22],
retro-reﬂection by Andreev scattering [23], and spec-
troscopy of a gate-deﬁned quantum dot with supercon-
ducting leads [24, 25], which do not require a hard
proximity-induced gap in the semiconductor.

The two main results presented here are both conse-
quences of the transparent epitaxial Sm-S interface. The
ﬁrst is a doubling of the the lowest quantized conduc-
tance plateau, from 2e2/h in the normal state to 4e2/h
in the superconducting state, as predicted theoretically
[14]. The second is a strong suppression of conductance
for voltages smaller than the superconducting gap when

structures are patterned by standard III-V chemical etch-
ing techniques. An insulating 40 nm Al2O3 layer is de-
posited using atomic layer deposition and metallic gates
(5 nm Ti/50 nm Au) are evaporated onto the device. The
measurements were performed in a dilution refrigerator
with a base mixing chamber temperature Tmc ∼ 30 mK,
using four-terminal lock-in techniques and DC measure-
ments. Two lithographically similar devices were mea-
sured, with similar results.

A scanning electron micrograph of Device 1 is shown
in Fig. 1b. The conductance of the QPC is tuned by neg-
ative voltages applied to the gates. The QPC is located
∼ 150 nm in front of the region where the Al ﬁlm has not
been removed. Figure 2 shows conductance traces for the
two lithographically similar QPCs. In the superconduct-
ing state, both devices show increased conductance at
the plateau of the QPC and suppressed conductance be-
low G ∼ 0.8G0, where G0 ≡ 2e2/h, relative to the normal
state. This behavior is the hallmark of Andreev reﬂection
being the dominant conduction mechanism through the
QPC [14, 28]. Raising the temperature above the criti-
cal temperature of the Al ﬁlm, applying an out-of-plane
magnetic ﬁeld, or applying a bias larger than the gap, all
bring the lowest plateau back to 2e2/h (see Fig. 2). The
dip structure, observed in both samples, at the transition
between conductance plateaus could be caused by mode

the QPC is in the tunneling regime—that is, the de-
tection of a hard superconducting gap in a proximitized
2DEG. Conductance doubling arises from Andreev reﬂec-
tion transferring charge 2e into the superconductor [26].
The hard gap reﬂects the absence of electronic states be-
low the superconducting gap in the semiconductor. Using
gate voltage to control the QPC, we measure conductance
across the transition from weak tunneling to the open-
channel regime and ﬁnd good (but not perfect) agree-
ment with the theory of a normal-QPC-superconductor
structure [14].

The starting material is an undoped InAs/InGaAs het-
erostructure with epitaxial Al as a top layer, grown by
molecular beam epitaxy [12]. A cross-sectional TEM
showing a sharp epitaxial Sm-S interface is shown in
Fig. 1a.
In the devices reported here, the thickness of
the InGaAs barrier was b = 10 nm, and the Al ﬁlm was
a = 10 nm. A Hall ball fabricated on the same wafer with
the Al removed (using Transene D aluminum etch) gave
density n = 3 · 1012 cm−2 and mobility µ = 104 cm2/Vs,
yielding a mean free path le ∼ 230 nm.
In a simi-
lar wafer, weak anti-localization analysis gave a spin-
orbit length lso ∼ 45 nm [12]. The Al ﬁlm has a crit-
ical temperature Tc = 1.56 K, corresponding to a gap
∆0 = 235 µeV, enhanced from the bulk value of Al, and
consistent with other measurements on Al ﬁlms of similar
thickness [27]. The in-plane critical ﬁeld of the Al ﬁlm
is Bc = 1.65 T [12]. Ohmic contacts to the InAs elec-
tron gas are formed by the epitaxial Al directly and mesa

tion in transparency of the already open ﬁrst channel.
A constant contact resistance Rc ∼ 1 kΩ has been sub-
tracted in each viewgraph, a value chosen to move the
ﬁrst plateau in the normal state to G0.

By further depleting the electron gas in the constric-
tion, the device is operated as a tunnel probe of the
local density of states in the InAs 2DEG. This tech-
nique has been applied to studying subgap properties
of semiconductor nanowires coupled to superconductors
[15–17, 19, 29, 30].
In Fig. 3a the QPC voltage is
decreased to gradually transition from the one-channel
regime, where the zero bias conductance is 4e2/h, to
the tunneling regime, where conductance is strongly sup-
pressed for |Vsd| < 190 µV. From these measurements,
the gap in the density of states of the InAs due to the
proximity to the Al is estimated to be ∆(cid:63) ∼ 190 µeV
(measured peak-to-peak). The value of ∆(cid:63) is similar,
but not identical, to the gap in the Al ﬁlm as estimated
from Tc, as discussed above.

In the case of perfect Andreev reﬂection from the su-
perconductor/semiconductor interface, the conductance
of one channel through a constriction proximal to the
interface is given by

Gns = 2G0

G2
nn

(2G0 − Gnn)2 ,

where Gns is the conductance when the ﬁlm is supercon-
ducting, and Gnn is the conductance in the normal state
[14]. In Fig. 3c the prediction in Eq. (1) with no free pa-
rameters (green line) and experimental data are shown.
Here, Gnn is the average conductance for |Vsd| > 0.8 mV,
justiﬁed by the equality of applying a bias and raising
the temperature above Tc, as shown in Fig. 2a. Equation
(1) is consistent with the data over two orders of mag-
nitude in Gns, indicating that the zero bias conductance
up to 4e2/h is well described by the prediction of per-
fect Andreev reﬂection of a single QPC mode. However,
the systematic deviation between data and prediction in
Fig. 3c for Gns < 10−2 2e2/h could be a manifestation of
a small remnant non–zero normal scattering probability.

The shapes of the conductance curves at eVsd (cid:46) ∆(cid:63) in
the tunneling regime (red line in Fig. 3b) are smeared
relative to the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer
(BCS) density of states of a superconductor. This could
be due to broadening of the BCS coherence peaks in the
disordered superconducting ﬁlm formed in the 2DEG un-
der the Al [31], a weak coupling between Al and 2DEG
[18] or the layout of the tunnel probe relative to the prox-
imitized 2DEG [32–34].

The temperature dependence of the conductance in
the Andreev QPC is diﬀerent in the one-channel and
in the tunnel regime (Fig. 4). The one-channel regime
(Fig. 4a,b) has a pronounced kink at T = Tc, presumably
associated with the sudden onset of Andreev enhanced
subgap conductance.
In contrast, the temperature-
dependence in the tunnel regime (Fig. 4c,d) is smeared
close to Tc due to thermally excited quasiparticles.

Fig. 4) by calculating G = (cid:82) dEG(E)(− ∂f

The temperature dependence is simulated (insets in
∂E ) where f is
the Fermi function which accounts for thermal broaden-
ing. The conductance G(E) is calculated by combining
scattering matrices of quasielectrons and quasiholes in
the normal region and Andreev reﬂection at the super-
conductor interface (details given in supplementary ma-
terials). The scattering matrices are calculated using the
numerical package Kwant [35], and the simulation is per-
formed using the device geometry from the micrograph in
Fig. 1b. The temperature dependence of the gap is mod-

eled with ∆(cid:63)(T ) = ∆(cid:63)(cid:112)1 − (T /Tc)2, and the Andreev

reﬂection amplitude is taken from [14]. The simulation
shows good quantitative agreement with the data.

To drive a superconductor/semiconductor device into
a topological regime, one requirement is gµBB > ∆(cid:63),
while the native superconductor retains its gap. Fig-
ure 5 shows the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld dependence of ∆(cid:63),
c ∼ 300 mT
from which an approximate critical ﬁeld B(cid:63)
is extracted. A rough estimate of the g-factor can be in-
ferred by assuming the critical B(cid:63)
c results from Zeeman
energy surpassing the induced superconducting gap, that
c = ∆(cid:63), which yields g ∼ 10, similar to the g-
is gµBB(cid:63)
factor in bulk InAs. In Fig. 5d the zero-bias conductance
is shown for the two diﬀerent in-plane directions, and
the slight direction dependence of B(cid:63)
c could be due to an
anisotropic g-factor in the InAs crystal lattice. The in-
duced gap in the 2DEG disappears at in plane magnetic
ﬁelds signiﬁcantly smaller than the critical ﬁeld of the
Al ﬁlm itself. Taken together with the strong spin-orbit
interaction (lso ∼ 45 nm), allows this superconductor-
2DEG system to be driven into the topological regime,
where the Zeeman energy should close the gap in the
semiconductor, while the parent superconductor retains
its superconducting properties.

bling through a QPC proximal to a superconduc-
tor/semiconductor interface, conﬁrming a long-standing
theoretical prediction [14]. Operated as a gate-tunable
tunnel probe of the local density of states, the QPC shows
a hard superconducting gap induced in the 2DEG. The
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the induced gap compares
favorably with the critical ﬁeld of the superconducting
ﬁlm, opening possibilities to pursue topological states
of matter in one-dimensional structures fabricated from

FINITE BIAS MEASUREMENTS OF THE TRANSITION FROM 4e2/h TO HARD GAP

The data in Fig. 3 of the main text is measured in a DC setup, incrementing the voltage in steps of size 3 µV. The
data is smoothed over 10 steps and the derivative is calculated numerically to obtain the diﬀerential conductance.
A constant contact resistance Rc = 800 Ω is subtracted from the data, moving the conductance at Vg = −8.2 V for
Vsd > 0.8 mV to 2e2/h. The 4-terminal resistance of the device is Rd = 400 Ω with Vg = 0 V. The diﬀerence between
Rc and Rd is most likely dominated by the change of resistivity near the gated region, when the gate is turned on, as
well as the distance from the voltage probe to the QPC region. The voltage probes are located ∼ 15 µm away from
the QPC and the gates overlap the mesa over an area ∼ 1.6 µm2. The normal state conductance is calculated as the
average of G(Vsd) for Vsd in the range [±0.8 mV,±1 mV]. The analysis is largely unaﬀected by changing the averaging
window for values |Vsd| > 0.6 mV. The cuts in Fig. 3b are taken by averaging over a 12 mV (30 mV) window in Vg
for the one-channel (tunneling) regime. Finally, each datapoint in Fig. 3c is calculated as the average over a 10 mV
range in Vg.

MEASUREMENTS ON ALTERNATE WAFER

Under identical growth conditions, a wafer without an InGaAs top barrier (i.e. b = 0 nm) between the epitaxial
aluminum and the InAs quantum well was produced. The density and mobility, measured using a conventional Hall
bar geometry, was n = 4.5 · 1016 m−2 and µ = 4000 cm2/Vs, corresponding to a mean free path of le = 150 nm. In
a lithographically similar device to that shown in Fig. 1 of the main text, we observe a hard superconducting gap
(Fig. S1). When the gates are operated in the quantum point contact regime, we did not observe quantized steps
in conductance. The non-monotonic decrease in conductance at Vsd = 0 mV, believed to be due to disorder in the
2DEG, makes the identiﬁcation of a superconducting gap in this wafer diﬃcult (Fig. S1b).

However, by increasing the temperature (Fig. S2a) or the magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. S2b) we conﬁrm that the gap in the

density of states in Fig. S1 is related to the superconducting properties of the aluminum ﬁlm.

Model for numerical simulations

We calculate the conductance of the junction in two steps. Firstly, we determine the scattering properties of the
normal region which we assume is a 1.1 µm wide channel of length L, where we have taken dimensions from SEM in
Fig. 1b in the main text. It is described by the spinless Hamiltonian,

We model the QPC as two rectangular gates located at x = 400 nm, with the width 2W , separated by the length 2S

Numerical results

For the simulation we adopt the following parameters: chemical potential µ = 143 meV, mean free path le = 230
nm, eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.05me (obtained from k.p calculation of the Fermi velocity for a single mode quantum well
in the growth direction). We also assume Tc = 1.6 K and ∆∗ = 190 µeV. The QPC geometry is set by the parameters:
W = 50 nm (width of gates), S = 75 nm (separation between gates) and d = 50 nm (distance from gates down to the
2DEG).

We consider a system of the geometry similar to the one presented on Fig. 1b of the main text. Here the supercon-

ductor interface is located 230 nm after the QPC.

Figure S4a shows the conductance as a function of the gate voltage. The Gns conductance depicted with the
black curve is quantized in multiplies of 4e2/h as the transport involves transmission of an electron and an Andreev-
reﬂected hole. Figures S4b,c show the Andreev-enhanced spectroscopy curves obtained by varying the injection
energy E. Figure S4b and S4b show, respectively, the calculated ﬁnite–bias properties of the one–channel regime
and the tunneling regime, for several values of the temperature. The value of Vg in the simulations are chosen so the
conductance at zero bias match the data at T > Tc in Fig. 4 of the main text. The low temperature spectroscopy

curves are similar the ones obtained by using the analytic expression of Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) [S5].
However, for energies larger than the gap, the spectroscopy simulations show an increasing trend as a function of E
(cf. the orange curves on Fig. S4b,c where T > Tc), due to an increase of the energy of the injected particle with
respect to the QPC potential. This dependence is pronounced in our geometry, because the slopes of the QPC steps
are less than 50 meV wide, making the conductance sensitive to changes in E on the scale of single meV.
The low temperature one-channel spectroscopy curve shows maxima at |E| (cid:39) ∆ (blue curve in Fig. S4b) while in
the experimental data (cf. Fig. 4a and Fig. 5a of the main text) the curves decrease smoothly as |Vsd| is increased.
Previous theoretical work [S6] showed that the detailed layout of the interface between the normal and superconducting
electrodes (at the scale of the coherence length) impacts the subgap conductance due to interference between two
electrons tunneling through the interface. Moreover, smearing of the superconducting coherence peak [S7] is predicted
to be an eﬀect of disorder present in the superconducting ﬁlm pointing again to the role of normal-superconductor
interface.

The experimental structure consist of an extended 2DEG/superconductor interface created by the InGaAs/InAs
heterostructure covered by Al. In the present calculations, we are limited to an abrupt semiconductor/superconductor
interface. We therefore also consider a case where the distance from the QPC to the interface is increased relative to
the lithographic dimensions.

Figure S5 shows results obtained for a system with 800 nm distance between the QPC gates and the superconductor
interface. In this calculation the scattering region is longer than the mean free path, leading to the peak/dip structures
superimposed on the QPC conductance steps. Similar peaks/dips are observed in the experimental data in Figs. 2a,b
of the main text. The ﬂuctuations are more pronounced in the superconducting case (Gns) due to the Andreev-
enhanced conductance involving traversing the scattering region twice. The resonant features are also visible in the
low temperature spectroscopy curves for energies larger the superconducting gap (cf. Figs. S5b,c), similar to the
experimental curves in Figs. 4 a,c. Comparable pinch oﬀ curves are obtained when the disorder is located before the
QPC, if the distance between the QPC and the superconductor are short.

The most notable feature of the system with extended length between the QPC and the superconductor is a
signiﬁcant reduction of the width of the central peak in the one–channel ﬁnite–bias simulations (blue curve in Fig. S5b).
The rapid drop in conductance is a hallmark of an induced gap, for which the chaotic billiard in the region between
the QPC gates and superconductor has zero density of states. The energy scale at which conductance drops is denoted
Eb, and has the magnitude of Thouless energy [S8, S9], and hence it is inversely proportional to the area between
the QPC and the interface. For |E| > Eb the billiard has a non-zero discrete spectrum and so for Eb < |E| < ∆
the conductance exhibits oscillations due to transport through resonant states which here are smoothed already for
T = 0.1 K due to temperature averaging. The smooth resonances are also present in the low-temperature conductance
curve in the tunneling regime (Fig. S5c).
