ABSTRACT
At redshift larger than 3 there is a disagreement between the number of blazars (whose jet is
pointing at us) and the number of expected parents (whose jet is pointing elsewhere). Now we
strengthen this claim because (i) the number of blazars in the SDSS+FIRST survey increased,
demanding a more numerous parent population, and (ii) the detected blazars have a radio
ﬂux large enough to be above the FIRST ﬂux limit even if the jet is slightly misaligned.
The foreseen number of these slightly misaligned jets, in principle detectable, is much larger
than the radio–detected sources in the FIRST+SDSS survey (at redshift larger than 4). This
argument is independent of the presence of an isotropic radio component, such as the hot spot
or the radio lobe, and does not depend on the bulk Lorentz factor Γ. We propose a scenario
that ascribes the lack of slightly misaligned sources to an over–obscuration of the nucleus by
a “bubble” of dust, possibly typical of the ﬁrst high–redshift quasars.

Key words: quasars: general; quasars: supermassive black holes – galaxies: jets – galaxies:
active – accretion discs

1 INTRODUCTION

Blazars (ﬂat spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs, and BL Lac objects)
produce most of their non–thermal radiation in jets whose plasma
is moving relativistically at small angles θ from the line of sight.
How small must be the viewing angle for a source to be a blazar is
not deﬁned exactly, but we have proposed to use θ < 1/Γ, where
Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the emitting plasma. Under this def-
inition, for a jet pointing in our direction within an angle 1/Γ there
must exist other 2Γ2 sources with their jets pointing elsewhere:
these sources form the parent population of blazars, and are usually
associated with the FR I (low luminosity) and FR II (high luminos-
ity) radio–galaxies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974).

Volonteri et al. (2011; hereafter V11) pointed out the difﬁ-
culties in reconciling the number of blazars observed at high red-
shifts with the number of the expected parent population. The ﬂux
of these sources is less beamed and ampliﬁed with respect to the
aligned sources, and for large enough θ is even de–beamed, but the
extended structures at the end of the jets (hot spots and lobes), that
emit isotropically, could be bright enough to be detectable, espe-
cially if the jet is powerful (FR II type), as are all the jets detected
at high redshifts.

V11 also pointed out that the disagreement between the num-
ber of blazars and their parents occurs only for redshifts z >
∼ 3. This
was based on two cross correlated catalogs: the Fifth Quasar Cata-
log (Schneider et al. 2010) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS;

York et al. 2000) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty–
Centimeters (FIRST; White et al. 1997). The SDSS Quasar Catalog
is a spectroscopic, magnitude limited quasar survey (Mi < 19 or
21 for low– and high–redshift quasars) and FIRST is a VLA radio
survey complete above 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz. The common sky area
is 8,770 square degrees. The quasars belonging to the two samples
(that we will collectively call SDSS+FIRST) have been studied by
Shen et al. (2011). According to this study, and listed in Tab. 2, in
the redshift bin 4 < z < 5 there are 1192 quasars, 49 of which
are radio-detected. Of these, at least 6 are blazars. Above redshift 5
there are 56 quasars, of which 4 are radio–detected, and 2 of these
are blazars.

If we take the 6 blazars with redshift between 4 and 5, we
expect 1200(Γ/10)2 misaligned jets, but we see a total of only 49
radio sources above 1 mJy. Above z > 5, the 2 observed blazars
should correspond to 400(Γ/10)2 parents, but we see a total of
only 4 sources above 1 mJy. These numbers strengthen the problem
pointed out in V11, because, since then, more radio sources in the
SDSS+FIRST turned out to be blazars (see e.g. Sbarrato et al. 2013;
Ghisellini et al. 2014; Sbarrato et al. 2015).

V11 proposed three possible solutions to this disagreement: i)
the bulk Lorenz factor is much lower than what it is at z <
∼ 3. To
reconcile the numbers, we would need Γ = 2, which is inconsis-
tent with the observed properties of high–z blazars; ii) there is a
(yet unknown) bias in the SDSS+FIRST survey against the detec-
tion of high–z radio–loud sources. For instance, the isotropic radio
structure could be young and compact, self–absorbed at frequen-
cies larger than 10 GHz (in the rest frame), and therefore be below

2

G. Ghisellini & T. Sbarrato

the 1 mJy ﬂux detection limit of the FIRST; iii) the SDSS+FIRST
survey misses the detection of a large population of parents because
their optical ﬂux is absorbed by dust. A fourth solution would be
to postulate the absence of the hot spot and lobe in these sources,
or that these structures are very faint in the radio band for redshifts
larger than 3.

In fact, the ∝ (1 + z)4 scaling of the cosmic background ra-
diation (CMB) energy density can greatly affect the radio emission
of extended structures, as explored by Mocz, Fabian & Blundell
(2011) and by Ghisellini et al. (2013; 2015). Consider two sources
at different redshifts, that have the same size, magnetic ﬁeld, and
that are energized by the same injected power. The higher–z source
will have a fainter radio emission and a stronger X–ray luminosity
than the lower–z source. The quenching of the radio emission can
help to reconcile the disagreement between the number of high–z
blazars and the corresponding number of expected parents, but in
this paper we point out that this effect is not enough.

In fact we will point out that also the sources whose jet is
slightly misaligned can produce a ﬂux above the threshold limit of
the radio survey. This is independent of the CMB energy density.
If a jet emits a radio ﬂux of – say – 200 mJy and it is observed
at a given (small) θ, there should be other similar jets observed at
larger viewing angles but whose radio ﬂux is larger than the ﬂux
limit of the survey (in our case, 1 mJy). Even these sources are
missing. The problem is even more severe because we will show
that the expected number of these sources is independent of the
bulk Lorentz factor. We believe that this calls for a revision of our
basic understanding of these high–z sources.

2 SLIGHTLY MISALIGNED JETS

We deﬁne as blazar a source whose jet is observed at a viewing
angle θ 6 1/Γ. At θ = 1/Γ, the Doppler factor is

Assuming that the maximum observable boost is for sin θ ∼

1/Γ → cos θ = β:

Fmax(ν) = δp

maxF ′(ν) = F ′(ν)Γp

The maximum viewing angle θc at which this source can be seen is
set by

Fmin(ν) = δp

minF ′(ν) =

F ′(ν)

[Γ(1 − β cos θc)]p

(4)

Therefore the ratio of the maximum to the minimum ﬂuxes gives:

δ ≡

Fmin(ν)

Smaller angles have larger Doppler factors (at 0◦, δ ∼ 2Γ), but the
probability P to observe a jet pointing exactly at us is vanishingly
small (P ∝ θ2). Assume that a source, in the comoving (primed)
frame, emits a monochromatic ﬂux F ′(ν ′) = F ′(ν/δ). Then the
observer at Earth will see a ﬂux F (ν):

F (ν) = δpF ′(ν)

(2)

The exponent p can have different values. If the emission is a power
law of spectral index α [i.e. F (ν) ∝ ν −α] we have, among the
several possibilities:

• p = 2 + α: in this case the jet emits between two locations
that are stationary in the observer frame. The radiation is emitted
isotropically in the comoving frame. Sometimes this is called the
ﬁnite lifetime jet case.

• p = 3 + α: this is the case of a moving blob, emitting isotrop-

ically in the comoving frame.

• p = 4 + 2α: the jet is a moving blob emitting inverse Comp-
ton radiation using seed photons that are produced externally to the
jet (the so called external Compton mechanism), and that are dis-
tributed isotropically in the observer frame. The inverse Compton
ﬂux is not isotropic in the comoving frame, but it is enhanced in
the forward direction (see Dermer 1995). This changes the pattern
of the radiation as seen in the observer frame with respect to the
previous (p = 3 + α) case.

This gives the maximum viewing angle as:

where the last approximate equality is valid for β → 1. In this limit
the ratio R is not dependent on Γ.

As an example, assume that the brightest radio source in a
sample is a blazar with Fmax(ν) = 100 mJy and the limiting ﬂux
of the same sample is 1 mJy. Assume α = 0 and p = 3. The very
existence of this blazar implies the existence of other [2×1001/3 −
1] = 8.3 observed jets, independent of the presence or absence of
isotropic extended hot spots/lobes. The limiting viewing angle does
depend on Γ, and is θc ∼ 17.5◦ (if Γ = 10) or 8.7◦ (if Γ = 20).

Table 2. Numbers of radio–detected quasars in the SDSS+FIRST spectroscopic sample and number of predicted misaligned objects. We have applied Eq.
8 for each blazars considering its actual radio ﬂux and the limiting ﬂux of 1 mJy of the FIRST survey. For each blazar, there are 2Γ2 ∼ 338(Γ/13)2 jets
pointing in other directions. The number of blazars refers to the objects spectroscopically observed for the construction of the catalog. There are other high–z
blazars in the SDSS+FIRST sky area, that were photometrically detected, but that were not followed up spectroscopically (see Table 1 and Ghisellini et al.
2015).

Extending this approach to all the blazars in a sample, and
adopting for each of them its radio ﬂux Fi(ν) and the same ﬂux
limit (i.e. 1 mJy) we can calculate for each blazar how many
slightly misaligned jets we expect to be observable, and then sum
up to obtain the total expected ratio between the total detectable
sources and the total observed blazars:

3 PREDICTED VS OBSERVED RADIO–LOUD SOURCES

We can apply the calculations detailed in the previous section to
a real ﬂux–limited complete sample. In few previous works, in
fact, we classiﬁed a number of blazar candidates included in the
SDSS+FIRST (Ghisellini et al. 2014; Sbarrato et al. 2012; 2013;
2015). From these studies, we concluded that there are (at least) 6
blazars in the SDSS+FIRST spectroscopic catalog at 4 6 z < 5,
and 2 at z > 5. These are listed in the top part of Tab. 1. Note
that the three sources included in the SDSS+FIRST, but not in its
spectroscopic catalog (classiﬁed in Ghisellini et al. 2015) are here
excluded because they do not have the necessary optical ﬂux to en-
ter the SDSS+FIRST spectroscopic, ﬂux–limited sample. They are
listed in the bottom part of Tab. 1.

We are conﬁdent that these blazars are indeed observed at an
angle θ < 1/Γ. In fact the X–ray ﬂux and spectrum (due to external
Compton) are dependent on the viewing angle in a stronger way
than the radio (synchrotron) ﬂux, as mentioned in §2 (the p–value is
different). At high redshift (and in the absence of a detection in the
γ–ray band), this is the best diagnostic to derive the jet orientation
(see Fig. 3 of Sbarrato et al. 2015 showing how the SED changes
by small changes in the viewing angle). Furthermore, in the case of
B2 1023+25, the small viewing angle and large Lorentz factor were
conﬁrmed by the european VLBI (EVN) observations by Frey et al.
(2015).

The existence of these blazars, compared with the whole
SDSS+FIRST radio–detected sample, highlights a large discrep-
ancy regarding the number of slightly misaligned jets. As listed in
Table 2, the radio ﬂuxes of the 6 blazars allow to predict a total of
616 [6 × Rtot(p = 2)] or 270 [6 × Rtot(p = 3)] jetted sources
detectable in the SDSS+FIRST survey in the 4 6 z < 5 redshift
bin. At z > 5, this number is 72 (p = 2) or 30 (p = 3). We believe
that this is a severe disagreement, because:

(i) the number of expected slightly misaligned objects derived

from the known blazars is robust, because independent of Γ.

(ii) Since the ﬂux comes from the jet, these objects are observed
as point–like sources. This bypasses the problem of associating one
(or two, in the case of a double radio source) radio objects not co-

c(cid:13) 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

incident with a SDSS source. Furthermore, there is no problem as-
sociated with the detection of extended emission.

(iii) All high–z blazars have their optical ﬂux completely dom-
inated by the accretion disc radiation. The synchrotron emission
(that can be depressed more than the radio in slightly misaligned
sources, since α ∼1) does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the op-
tical ﬂux. This implies that slightly misaligned sources should in
principle be included in the SDSS quasar catalog.

(iv) The presence of a dusty torus should not affect the opti-
cal ﬂux, as long as its opening angle is similar to lower redshift
sources. This implies that the optical emission, in a standard sce-
nario, should not be obscured.

4 OBSCURING BUBBLES: A WAY OUT

The discrepancy between the predicted and observed number of
sources that have slightly misaligned jets is serious, and calls for
an explanation. In addition, we are not aware of any instrumental
selection effect strongly biasing our sample. The possibility that
were proposed previously by V11 aimed to account for the lack of
extended and isotropically radio sources, namely the foreseen par-
ent population of high–z blazars. To explain these (still missing)
sources we can envisage two possible reasons: i) the observational
difﬁculty to detect a weak extended radio source at some angular
distance from a point–like optical object and ii) the “radio quench-
ing” effect due to the enhanced CMB radiation energy density that
cools more efﬁciently the emitting electrons through the inverse
Compton mechanisms and that weakens their radio emission.

However, the regions of the jet producing the 1.4 GHz radio
ﬂux ( >
∼ 7 GHz rest frame) are not affected by the “quenching”
of the radio due to the CMB radiation. This is because they have a
magnetic energy density much larger than the CMB one, even tak-
ing into account the Γ2 enhancement due to the relativistic motion
of the emitting plasma.

At z = 4, the CMB energy density is UCMB ∼ 2.6 × 10−10
erg cm−3. In the comoving frame, this is enhanced by a factor
∼ Γ2, thus reaching U ′ = 2.6 × 10−8(Γ/10)2 erg cm−3. Most
of the observed radiation from the jet is produced in a compact
region, where the magnetic ﬁeld is around 3 G, and the observed
self–absorption frequency is νt ∼ 3 × 1012 Hz (rest frame, see e.g.
Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2015). In the case of a ﬂat radio spectrum,
the self–absorption frequency scales as R−1, where R is the dis-
tance from the black hole. This is the same dependence of the dom-
inant component of the magnetic ﬁeld B. Therefore in the region
self–absorbing at 7 GHz (rest frame) B should be ∼ 6 mG, and its
energy density UB = B2/(8π) ∼ 1.4×10−6. Since UB > U ′
CMB,
there is no “quenching” of the synchrotron emission of the jet.

Figure 1. Cartoon of the proposed scenario (not to scale). The grey sphere
is the obscuring bubble, pierced by the jet (in orange). The accretion disc
(blue) and the BLR (brown) are unobscured only if the source is observed
down the jet.

4.1 The proposed scenario

∼ 109M⊙

To solve the tension between predicted and observed sources, we
propose a scenario that follows the ideas put forward by Fabian
(1999). At redshifts larger than ∼4, jetted sources hosting a black
1 are completely (i.e. 4π) surrounded
hole with mass M >
by obscuring material. Only the jet can pierce through this mate-
rial and break out. Observers looking down the jet can see the nu-
clear emission from the accretion disc and the broad emission lines.
For observers looking with viewing angles even only slightly larger
than θj ≈ 1/Γ, the optical emission (including broad lines) is ab-
sorbed, the ﬂux is fainter, and the source cannot enter the SDSS
catalog. The absorbed radiation is re–radiated in the infrared.

Even if the hot spots or the lobes were indeed emitting a radio
ﬂux above the 1 mJy level at the observed 1.4 GHz frequency, there
would be no source in the SDSS to match with if the jet is only
slightly misaligned. The quasi–spherical dusty structure (hereafter
“obscuring” or “dark bubble”) can cover the nuclear region until
the accretion disc radiation pressure blows it away. This can occur
at a threshold luminosity Lth = ηd ˙M c2.

5 DISCUSSION

Let us assume that the obscuring bubbles exist not only in jetted
sources, but are common to all high redshift quasars, including
radio–quiet ones. The evolution in time of the obscuring bubbles
and the central black hole mass could however be different in jetted
and non–jetted sources.

In fact, the presence of a jet could affect the accretion efﬁ-
ciency ηd, deﬁned as Ld = ηd ˙M c2: part of the dissipation of the
gravitational energy could amplify the magnetic ﬁeld instrumental
to launch the jet. In other words, while in the case of non–jetted
AGN the gravitational energy is dissipated only through radiation
from the disc (i.e. ηd = η), radio–loud sources could use a fraction

1 only the quasars with very massive black holes can be detected in the
SDSS

f of the released gravitational energy to heat the disc, and the re-
maining fraction (1 − f ) to launch the jet (Jolley & Kuncic 2008;
Jolley et al. 2009):

ηd = f η

(9)

This condition could lead to different evolution patterns of the ob-
scuring bubbles. If we assume an Eddington–limited accretion until
the obscuring bubble is blown away by the reached Lth, the mass
growth rate of the black hole is:

where mp is the proton mass, σT is the Thomson cross section
and G is the gravitational constant. Therefore the black hole mass
evolves as:

M (t; ηd) = M0 exp(cid:26) 1 − η

ηd

k t(cid:27)

(11)

The threshold luminosity can therefore be expressed as a function
of time:

(13)

Considering the difference in the use of gravitational energy in jet-
ted and non–jetted AGN, there is a clear difference in the time
needed for a source to blow away the dark bubble: if radio–loud
AGN dissipate in radiation only f = 1/2 of the released gravita-
tional energy, radio–loud AGN can get rid of their dark bubbles in
half time, compared to non–jetted sources.

On the other hand, the black hole mass, at the time tth, is inde-
pendent of f. For illustration, let us compare jetted and non–jetted
sources of equal seed black hole mass M0, all emitting at their Ed-
dington luminosity. Jetted sources have black holes that grow faster
(if ηd = f η). Therefore, at any given time, their Eddington lumi-
nosity is larger than that of the radio–quiet ones accreting with the
same total η, but with ηd = η. Fig. 2 shows the growth of the black
hole for different values of η and ηd, assuming that the accretion
starts at z = 20 on a seed black hole mass of 100 M⊙. Assuming
a threshold luminosity of Lth = 1047 erg s−1, this is reached ﬁrst
by the jetted sources. Fig. 2 shows also the case of a total efﬁciency
η = 0.1. Although we note the same trend (jetted sources with
ηd = 0.05 grows faster), we can note that in this case the threshold
luminosity Lth is reached at much larger redshifts. At z > 4, all
jetted sources would have lost their absorbing bubble, and would
be visible. One could also have jetted sources with η = 0.3 (and
a smaller ηd), but radio–quiet sources with η = ηd ∼ 0.1. In this
case the radio–quiet ones could blow out the absorbing bubbles ear-
lier than the jetted sources. This does not affect the general picture
we are proposing, but it seems unlikely that at very early times,
when we have large accretion rates, the spin of the black hole (that
controls the efﬁciency η) is less than its maximum value (Thorne
1974), for all kind of objects. Major mergings could reset the black
hole spin to values smaller than unity, but the rarity of very large
black hole masses and the short available time (of the order of 1
Gyr) makes this possibility unlikely.

Figure 2. Growth of a black hole mass for different values of the total
efﬁciency η and disc efﬁciency ηd. The horizontal dashed line corresponds
to an assumed Lth = 1047 erg s−1. The vertical dashed lines correspond to
the times (bottom axis) and the redshift (top axis) when the disc luminosity
reaches Lth.

In the case we are discussing (all sources have η = 0.3, but ηd
of radio quiet is larger than in radio–loud), we have an interesting
consequence. If we consider very large black hole masses (larger
than 109M⊙), jetted sources becomes fully visible in the optical
at earlier times than radio–quiet objects. Even if the intrinsic ratio
NL/NQ between the number of jetted and non jetted sources were
constant in time (e.g. NL/NQ = 0.1, as at low redshift), we would
infer at z >
∼ 4 a radio–loud fraction larger than NL/NQ from the
blazar population. We stress that this would be true only if we con-
sider large black hole masses, that need ∼ 1 Gyr to blow up the
absorbing bubble. If the critical luminosity Lth is smaller, it can
be produced by a black hole of a smaller mass, that is reached at
earlier times (larger redshifts). In this case, at z ∼ 4, these sources
are all visible, since they have already blown up their bubbles.

This dark bubble scenario makes a simple prediction: most
high–z parents of blazars with large black hole masses should be
absorbed in the optical band, but should be very bright in the in-
frared. In this respect we can look at high–z radio–galaxies. Indeed,
there is already one interesting example, 4C 41.17 (z ∼3.8), that is
extremely bright in the far infrared (with a luminosity exceeding
1047 erg s−1), but fainter in the optical by a factor ∼30 (Seymour
et al. 2007; Chambers et al. 1990; van Breugel et al. 1998; Wu et
al, in preparation). This is not a proof of a 4π absorbing bubble, but
suggests that the absorbing material intercepts a larger fraction of
the visible light, compared to local radio–galaxies.
