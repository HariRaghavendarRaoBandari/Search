Observations of several peculiar, under- and over-luminous type Ia supernovae (SNeIa)
argue for exploding masses widely diﬀerent from the Chandrasekhar-limit. We explore
the modiﬁcation to Einstein’s gravity in white dwarfs for the ﬁrst time in the literature,
which shows that depending on the (density dependent) modiﬁed gravity parameter α,
chosen for the present purpose of representation, limiting mass of white dwarfs could
be signiﬁcantly sub- as well as super-Chandrasekhar. Hence, this uniﬁes the apparently
disjoint classes of SNeIa, establishing the importance of modiﬁed Einstein’s gravity in
white dwarfs. Our discovery questions both the global validity of Einstein’s gravity and
the uniqueness of Chandrasekhar’s limit.

Keywords: Modiﬁed gravity; white dwarfs; supernova type Ia

1. Introduction

Since last few years, we have been exploring physics behind peculiar type Ia su-
pernovae (SNeIa), which are highly over-luminous, and the possible existence of
super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. Our initiation has brought the topic of super-
Chandrasekhar white dwarfs in limelight, with so many papers published following
us.

SNeIa are believed to be triggered from the violent thermonuclear explosion of
a carbon-oxygen white dwarf on approaching its mass the Chandrasekhar limit of
1. SNIa is used as a standard candle in understanding the expansion history
1.44M⊙
of the universe 2. Nevertheless, some of these SNeIa are highly over-luminous, e.g.
SN 2003fg, SN 2006gz, SN 2007if, SN 2009dc 3,4, and some others are highly under-
luminous, e.g. SN 1991bg, SN 1997cn, SN 1998de, SN 1999by 5,6. The luminosity of
the former group (super-SNeIa) implies the existence of highly super-Chandrasekhar
3,4. While, the latter group (sub-
progenitor white dwarfs with mass 2.1 − 2.8M⊙
SNeIa) predicts the progenitor mass to be as low as ∼ M⊙
While we argued, in a series of papers, that highly magnetized white dwarfs
could be as massive as inferred from the above super-SNeIa observations 7–9, they
are unable to explain the sub-SNeIa. All the previous models proposed to describe
them entail caveats. For example, although numerical simulations of the merger
of two sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs reproduce the sub-SNeIa, the underlying
simulated light-curves fade slower than that suggested by observations.

5.

Nonetheless, a major concern is a large number of of models required to explain
apparently the same phenomena, i.e., triggering of thermonuclear explosions in
white dwarfs. Why there are mutually uncorrelated sub- and super-SNeIa in nature?
This is where the proposal of modifying general relativity steps in into the context

of white dwarfs. We will show that modiﬁed general relativity uniﬁes the sub-classes
of SNeIa by a single underlying theory, hence serve as a missing link.

2. Basic equations and formalism

Let us start with the 4-dimensional action as 10

S = Z (cid:20) 1

16π

f (R) + LM(cid:21) √−g d4x,

(1)

where g is the determinant of the spacetime metric gµν, d4x the 4-dimensional vol-
ume element, LM the Lagrangian density of the matter ﬁeld, R the scalar curvature
deﬁned as R = gµνRµν , where Rµν is the Ricci tensor and f is an arbitrary function
of R; in general relativity, f (R) = R.

For the present purpose, we consider the simplistic Starobinsky model 11 deﬁned
as f (R) = R + αR2, when α is a constant. However, similar eﬀects could also be
obtained in other, physically more sophisticated, theories, where α (or eﬀective-
α) is varying (e.g., with density). Now, on extremizing the action Eq.
(1) for
Starobinsky’s model, one obtains the modiﬁed ﬁeld equation of the form

Gµν + α(cid:20)2RGµν +

1
2

R2gµν − 2(∇µ∇ν − gµν (cid:3))R(cid:21) = 8πTµν,

(2)

where Tµν contains only the matter ﬁeld (non-magnetic star), Gµν is Einstein’s ﬁeld
tensor, ∇µ and ∇ν are the covariant derivatives and (cid:3) = ∇µ∇µ (see Refs. 12, 13,
for details).
For the present purpose, we seek perturbative solutions of Eq. (2) (see, e.g.,
Ref. 14), such that αR ≪ 1. Furthermore, we consider the hydrostatic equilib-
rium condition so that gνr∇µT µν = 0, with zero velocity. Hence, we obtain the
diﬀerential equations for mass Mα(r), pressure Pα(r) (or density ρα(r)) and gravi-
tational potential φα(r), of spherically symmetric white dwarfs (which is basically
the set of modiﬁed Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ (TOV) equations). For α = 0,
these equations reduce to TOV equations in general relativity.

As the white dwarf is assumed to be nonmagnetized, we consider EoS, as ob-
tained by Chandrasekhar 1 at extremely low and high densities, P0 = Kρ1+(1/n)
,
where P and ρ of Ref. 1 are replaced by P0 and ρ0 respectively (α = 0: general rela-
tivity) in the spirit of perturbative approach. Here, n is the polytropic index and K
a dimensional constant. The boundary conditions are: Mα(0) = 0 and ρα(0) = ρc
(central mass and density respectively). Note that by varying ρc from 2×105 gm/cc
to 1011 gm/cc, we construct the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs.

3. Results
We show in Figs. 1(a) and (b) that all three Mα − ρc curves for α > 0 overlap
with the α = 0 curve in the low density region. However, as α increases, the region
of overlap decreases, receding to a lower ρc region. At ρc & 108, 4 × 107 and

2 × 106 gm/cc, modiﬁed general relativity eﬀects become important and visible for
α = 2 × 1013 cm2, 8 × 1013 cm2 and 1015 cm2 respectively. At a ﬁxed α, with
the increase of ρc, ﬁrst Mα increases, then by reaching a maximum value starts
decreasing, like the α = 0 (general relativity) case. The maximum mass Mmax
decreases with the increasing α and for α = 1015 cm2 it is as low as 0.81M⊙ (highly
sub-Chandrasekhar). This argues that modiﬁed general relativity has a tremendous
impact on white dwarfs.
In fact, 0.81 . Mmax/M⊙ . 1.31 for all the chosen
α > 0. This is a remarkable ﬁnding since it establishes that even if ρcs for these
sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs are lower than the conventional value at which
SNeIa are usually triggered, an attempt to increase the mass beyond Mmax with the
increase of ρc will lead to a gravitational instability. Subsequently, this presumably
will be leading to a runaway thermonuclear reaction, provided the core temperature
increases suﬃciently due to collapse. Occurrence of such thermonuclear runway
reactions, triggered at a low density as 106 gm/cc, has already been demonstrated 15.
Thus, once Mmax is approached for white dwarfs with α > 0, a SNIa is expected
to trigger just like in the α = 0 case, explaining the sub-SNeIa 5,6, like SN 1991bg
mentioned above.

Figure 1(b) shows that for ρc > 108 gm/cc with α < 0, the Mα − ρc curves
deviate from the general relativity curve due to modiﬁed general relativity eﬀects.
Note that Mmax for all the three cases corresponds to ρc = 1011 gm/cc, what upper-
limit is chosen to avoid possible neutron-drip. Interestingly, all values of Mmax, lying
in 1.8 − 2.7M⊙, are highly super-Chandrasekhar. Thus, while the general relativity
eﬀect is very small (but non-negligible), modiﬁed general relativity eﬀect could
lead to ∼ 100% increase in the limiting mass. The corresponding values of ρc are
large enough, i.e.
larger than ρc corresponding to Mmax of α = 0 case, to initiate
thermonuclear reactions, whereas the respective core temperatures are expected to
be similar. This explains the entire range of the observed super-SNeIa mentioned
above 3,4, assuming the furthermore gaining mass above Mmax leads to SNeIa.

Table 1 ensures the validity of perturbation approach of the solutions, where
we solve the modiﬁed TOV equations only up to O(α). Since the product αR
is ﬁrst order in α, we replace R in it by the zero-th order Ricci scalar R(0) =
8π(ρ(0) − 3P (0)), i.e. Ricci scalar in general relativity (α = 0). For the perturbative
validity of the entire solution, |αR(0)|max ≪ 1 should satisfy. Next, we consider
tt /gtt and g(0)
g(0)
rr /grr (ratios of gµν -s in general relativity and those in modiﬁed
general relativity up to O(α)), which should be close to unity for the validity of
perturbative method 16. Hence, |1 − g(0)
rr /grr|max ≪ 1
should both satisfy. Table 1 indeed shows that all three measures quantifying the
validity of perturbative are at least 2 − 3 orders of magnitude smaller than 1.

4. Possible chameleon-like eﬀect for density dependent model

parameter

we now justify that the eﬀects of modiﬁed general relativity based on a more sophis-
ticated calculation, invoking an (eﬀective) α varying explicitly with density (and
eﬀectively becoming negative), are likely to converge to those described above. Note
that even though α is assumed to be constant within individual white dwarfs here,
there is indeed an implicit dependence of α on ρc, clearly shown in Fig. 1(b) for lim-
iting mass white dwarfs presumably leading to SNeIa. This indicates the existence of
an underlying chameleon eﬀect, which trend is expected to emerge self-consistently

in a varying-α theory.

Let us consider a possible situation where α is varying explicitly with density
and try to relate it with the results presented above. Note the fact that the super-
SNeIa occur mostly in young stellar populations consisting of massive stars (see,
e.g., Ref. 3), while the sub-SNeIa occur in old stellar populations consisting of low
mass stars (see, e.g., Ref. 17). The massive stars with higher densities are likely to
give rise to super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs on collapse, which, on gaining mass,
would subsequently explode to produce super-SNeIa. The low mass stars with
lower densities would be expected to give rise to sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs
on collapse, which furthermore would probably end with sub-SNeIa. Now, let us
assume α to be depending on density in such a way that there are two terms — one
with negative sign dominates at higher densities and the other with positive sign
dominates at lower densities. Hence, when a massive, high density star collapses,
it results in similar to our α < 0 cases; while a low mass, low density star collapse
leads to results like our α > 0 cases. Thus, the same functional form of α could lead
to both super- and sub-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white dwarfs, respectively,
depending on their densities. Of course, the ﬁnal mass of the white dwarf would
depend on several factors, such as, ρc and the density gradient in the parent star,
etc. Interestingly, this description of density dependent α is essentially equivalent
to invoking a so-called “chameleon-f (R) theory”, which can pass solar system tests
of gravity (see, e.g., Ref. 18). This is so because, once α is a function of density,
it is a function of R. Hence, introduction of a density (and hence R) dependent α
is equivalent of choosing an appropriate (more complicated) f (R) model of gravity.
Therefore, a more self-consistent variation of α with density does not invalidate the
results of the constant-α cases, rather is expected to complement the picture.

We must mention that the orders of magnitude of α are diﬀerent between typical
white dwarfs (αWD ∼ 1013 cm2, as used above) and neutron stars (αNS ∼ 109 cm2,
e.g. 14,19). This again argues for the fact that there is an underlying chameleon eﬀect
which causes α to be diﬀerent in diﬀerent density regimes. Now, the quantity αR
would have a similar value in both neutron stars and white dwarfs in the pertur-
bative regime. Hence, due to their higher curvature and density, neutron stars will
harbor a smaller value of α compared to white dwarfs. Roughly, neutron stars are
104 times denser than white dwarfs and, therefore, αNS is 104 times smaller than
αWD. We also emphasize that the current work is an initiation of the exploration of
the eﬀects of modiﬁed gravity in white dwarfs, based on the motivation to explain
observations of peculiar SNeIa. Now, one has to polish the model step by step.

5. Summary

Based on a speciﬁc type of modiﬁed Einstein’s gravity, namely simple Starobinsky
f (R)-model, we show that modiﬁcations to general relativity are indispensable in
white dwarfs, in particular to explain observed data related to their limiting mass.
It remarkably explains and uniﬁes a wide range of SNeIa for which general relativ-

ity is insuﬃcient. Although the present study is based perturbative method, this
is indeed useful as then we have a handle on α characterizing our model, which
has an upper bound from astrophysical observations 20. Hence, depending on the
magnitude and sign of α, we obtain both highly super-Chandrasekhar and highly
sub-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white dwarfs, which furthermore help to estab-
lish them as progenitors of the peculiar super- and sub-SNeIa, respectively. Thus,
a single underlying theory, i.e. an f (R)-model, uniﬁes the two apparently, puzzling,
disjoint sub-classes of SNeIa, hence serves as a missing link. Our discovery raises
two fundamental questions. Is the Chandrasekhar limit unique? Is Einsteins gravity
the ultimate theory for understanding astronomical phenomena? Both the answers
appear to be no!
