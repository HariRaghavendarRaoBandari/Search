We develop an iterative diagonalization scheme in solving a one-body self-consistent-ﬁeld equation
in the transcorrelated (TC) method using a plane-wave basis set. Non-Hermiticity in the TC method
is well handled with a block-Davidson algorithm. We verify the required computational cost is
eﬃciently reduced by our algorithm. In addition, we apply our plane-wave-basis TC calculation to
some simple sp-electron systems with deep core states to elucidate an impact of the pseudopotential
approximation to the calculated band structures. We ﬁnd a position of the deep valence bands is
improved by an explicit inclusion of core states, but an overall band structure is consistent with a
regular setup that includes core states into the pseudopotentials. This study oﬀers an important
understanding for the future application of the TC method to strongly correlated solids.

INTRODUCTION

Density functional theory (DFT) [1, 2] has provided
valuable information of the electronic structure for a wide
range of materials over several decades. However, it is
now well known that popular approximations in DFT
such as local density approximation (LDA) and gener-
alized gradient approximation (GGA) lack accuracy for
strongly correlated systems. One possible strategy to go
beyond is to develop highly accurate DFT functionals.
Such trials have improved the situation to some extent,
but the exact form of the exchange-correlation energy
functional is out of reach owing to its non-trivial nature.

Another strategy is to employ a promising theoretical
framework independent of DFT: wave function theory
(WFT) such as quantum chemical methods [3, 4] and
several ﬂavors of novel quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
methods [4, 5]. WFT explicitly handles a many-body
wave function, which enables systematic improvement of
accuracy. Although this strategy works well for molecu-
lar systems, we have been faced with expensive computa-
tional cost for solids as a result of such an explicit treat-
ment of many-body problems. From this viewpoint, the
transcorrelated (TC) method [6–9], one of WFTs, has
been attracting much attention because of its fascinat-
ing advantages with practical computational cost. The
TC method makes use of a single-particle picture under
an eﬀective Hamiltonian explicitly represented with the
Jastrow correlation factor. For molecular systems, some

recent works have shown a high potentiality of the TC
method [8, 10, 11]. Optimization of the wave function
with a help of Monte Carlo integration [9, 12, 13] and
development of the canonical TC theory [14] are also re-
markable recent innovation. For solid-states calculations,
the TC method is shown to reproduce accurate band
structures [15–17] and optical absorption spectra [18].
The TC method and a related theory have been success-
fully applied also to the Hubbard model [19, 20]. It is
noteworthy that the TC method has a close relationship
with some QMC methods in the sense that both methods
employ the Jastrow correlation factor.

As of now, the TC method has been applied only to
weakly correlated systems in solid-states calculations. To
apply the TC method to strongly correlated solids, it is
necessary to employ an eﬃcient basis set for representing
the one-electron orbitals in the TC method. In the for-
mer studies [15, 16], the TC orbitals are expanded with
the LDA orbitals. Whereas a small number of LDA or-
bitals is required for convergence in weakly correlated
systems, its number will inevitably increase when one
handles localized states, which are not well-described by
LDA. As a matter of fact, we shall see that an enormously
large number of LDA orbitals are sometimes required and
then computational requirement becomes very expensive.
This problem should be resolved for further advance in
the TC method, especially for application to strongly cor-
related systems. Note that because an eﬀective Hamil-
tonian in the TC method is non-Hermitian, whether an
eﬃcient convergence is achieved in the TC method just
like other conventional methods is a non-trivial problem.

In this study, we develop an iterative diagonalization
scheme in solving a one-body self-consistent-ﬁeld (SCF)
equation in the TC method using a plane-wave basis set.
We ﬁnd that a subspace dimension to represent the TC

orbitals drastically decreases compared with the former
LDA-basis approach. This new development enhances
applicability of the TC method to various systems. As
a test, we apply our new algorithm to some simple sp-
electron systems with deep core states (i.e., a part of the
deep core states are not just included in pseudopotentials
but explicitly treated in a many-body wave function) and
clarify how the core electrons aﬀect the TC band struc-
tures. Treatment of core electrons has recently been rec-
ognized as an important issue to be taken care of.
In
the GW method [21–23], it has been pointed out that an
error arising from the pseudopotential is not negligible
in some cases [24–31]. The same situation was reported
also in QMC calculations [5, 32, 33]. In the TC method,
such an eﬀect has not been investigated, but to eluci-
date the impact of core electrons on the band structure
is an important and unavoidable problem. In addition,
because the TC method employs a many-body wave func-
tion common to some QMC methods, such investigation
will provide a valuable information also for the QMC
community. We ﬁnd that an explicit treatment of core
states improves a position of deep valence states whereas
the band structures in upper energy region do not exhibit
large changes, which means that our choice of the Jastrow
factor can provide consistent electronic structures for a
wide energy range whether the core electrons are explic-
itly treated or not. Our ﬁndings in this study encourage
application of the TC method to strongly correlated ma-
terials with d electrons where an explicit treatment of
semi-core sp electrons with the same principal quantum
number will be necessary [31, 32].

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we give a brief introduction of basic features of the TC
method.
In Sec. III, we present a block-Davidson al-
gorithm to solve a one-body SCF equation in the TC
method using a plane-wave basis set.
In Sec. IV, we
demonstrate how eﬃciently our new algorithm works,
and using this algorithm, we compare the band structures
calculated with core electrons explicitly treated in many-
body wave functions and those just included in pseudopo-
tentials for some simple sp-electron systems. Section V
summarizes this study.

II. TRANSCORRELATED METHOD

Since a detailed theoretical

framework of the TC
method was presented in previous papers [6, 8, 9], we just
make a brief review here. In electronic structure calcula-
tions, our objective is to solve the Schr¨odinger equation

where x = (r, σ) denotes a set of spatial and spin coor-
dinates associated with an electron. First, we formally
factorize the many-body wave function Ψ as Ψ = F Φ
where F is the Jastrow factor

F = exp(− N(cid:88)

and Φ is deﬁned as Ψ/F . Next, we perform a similarity
transformation of the Hamiltonian as

HΨ = EΨ ⇔ HTCΦ = EΦ (HTC = F −1HF ).

(4)

In this way, the electron correlation described with
the Jastrow factor is incorporated into the similarity-
transformed Hamiltonian HTC, which we called the TC
Hamiltonian hereafter. A Jastrow function u is chosen
as the following simple form: [5, 17]

with N , V , and ε being the number of electrons in the
simulation cell, the volume of the simulation cell, and the
static dielectric constsant, respectively. Core electrons ef-
fectively included in pseudopotentials are not counted in
the deﬁnition of N , which should be the same as that in
Eq. (2). A choice of ε in this study shall be described
in Sec. IV A. The asymptotic behavior of this function
is determined so as to reproduce the screened electron-
electron interaction in solids 1/(εr) in the long-range
limit [17, 34] and satisfy the cusp condition [35, 36] in the
short-range limit. To satisfy the exact cusp condition for
singlet and triplet pairs of electrons, one should adopt the
operator representation of the Jastrow function, which
introduces troublesome non-terminating series of the ef-
fective interaction in the TC Hamiltonian [37]. Thus we
use the approximated cusp conditions in the same man-
ner as in QMC studies [5]. Because this Jastrow function
captures both the short- and long-range correlations, a
mean-ﬁeld approximation for the TC Hamiltonian is ex-
pected to work well. Here we approximate Φ to be a sin-
gle Slater determinant consisting of one-electron orbitals:
Φ = det[φi(xj)], and then a one-body SCF equation is

also to solids [38]. A detailed description of the BiTC
method can be found in these literatures. In the BiTC
method, we use left and right Slater determinants con-
sisting of diﬀerent one-electron orbitals: X = det[χi(xj)]
and Φ = det[φi(xj)], respectively, with the bi-orthogonal
condition (cid:104)χi|φj(cid:105) = δi,j and the normalization condi-
tion (cid:104)φi|φi(cid:105) = 1. Then a one-body SCF equation be-
comes slightly diﬀerent from Eq. (8) in the sense that
‘bra’ orbitals φ∗(x) are replaced with χ∗(x). Because
the similarity transformation of Hamiltonian introduces
non-Hermiticity, such formulation yields a diﬀerent re-
sult from the ordinary TC method.
In this study, we
investigate both the TC and BiTC methods.

(10)

By solving Eq. (8), one can optimize TC one-electron
orbitals. This procedure costs just the same order as
the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock (HF) method with a help
of an eﬃcient algorithm [16]. By construction, Φ can
be systematically improved over a single Slater determi-
nant [8, 10, 11, 18, 38], which is an important advantage
of the TC method, but in this study, we focus on the case
where Φ is supposed to be a single Slater determinant.

exp[−(cid:80)

We note that the non-Hermiticity of the TC Hamil-
tonian originating from the non-unitarity of the Jastrow
factor is essential in the description of the electron cor-
relation eﬀects. It is obvious that the purely imaginary
Jastrow function u(xi, xj) that makes the Jastrow factor
i,j((cid:54)=i) u(xi, xj)] unitary cannot fulﬁll the cusp
condition and the long-range asymptotic behavior men-
tioned before. Although some previous studies adopted
approximations for the eﬀective interaction in the TC
Hamiltonian to restore the Hermiticity for molecular sys-
tems with a small number of electrons [13, 14], it is un-
clear that such approximation is valid for general molec-
ular and periodic systems. Therefore, in this study, we
explicitly handle the non-Hermiticity of the TC Hamil-
tonian without introducing additional approximations.

We also mention the bi-orthogonal formulation of the
TC method, which we called the BiTC method. The
BiTC method was applied to molecules [10] and recently

In the former studies of the TC method applied to
solid-state calculations, we have used LDA orbitals as
basis functions to expand the TC orbitals in solving the
SCF equation for eﬃcient reduction of computational
cost [15]. This prescription works well if a moderate
number of LDA orbitals are required for convergence
as in previous studies. However, this is not necessarily
the case when we deal with the systems where TC and
LDA orbitals are expected to exhibit sizable diﬀerences,
e.g., for strongly correlated systems. To overcome this
problem, we develop an iterative diagonalization scheme
using a plane-wave basis set. Because the TC Hamil-
tonian is non-Hermitian owing to the similarity trans-
formation, some standard methods such as the conju-
gate gradient (CG) method [39] do not work and so we
adopted the block-Davidson algorithm [40, 41]. Whereas
the block-Davidson algorithm has been successfully ap-
plied to other conventional methods such as DFT, some
modiﬁcations described below are necessary to adopt it
to the TC method.

Figure 1 presents a ﬂow of our calculation. Here we
deﬁne the TC-Fock operator F [φ] as F [φ]φi(x) equals
the left-hand side of Eq. (8). Our algorithm consists of
a double loop. In the inner loop labeled with p, a sub-
space dimension is gradually increased. In the outer loop
labeled with q, the TC-Fock operator is diagonalized in
that subspace and the convergence is checked. Both in-
dices start from 1. Detailed description of the algorithm
is presented below.

tional eﬀort for the TC method owing to the existence
of the three-body terms. Thus we tried two types of the

the next q loop:

value. Trial vectors v included in F [v(1,˜q)] are updated
for every Nupdate loops of q, i.e., ˜q is deﬁned as (the
maximum multiple of Nupdate) +1 not exceeding q. At
the same time as such update, we check convergence for
i where f () is the occupation num-
ber, instead of a bit expensive evaluation of the total en-
ergy in the TC method. f () is always 0 or 1 in this study
but can be a fractional number for metallic systems. If we
store the matrix elements of the one, two, and three-body
terms in the Fock matrix separately, the total energy can
be eﬃciently evaluated and future implementation along
this line is possible, but the present convergence crite-
ria does not arise any problem in this study. For band
structure calculation after an self-consistent determina-
tion of the occupied orbitals[44], we instead check con-
. If convergence is achieved, we once
evaluate the total energy for output and calculation ends.
Otherwise, the q loop is continued.
In principle, other
convergence criteria are also applicable, e.g., that with
respect to the electron density. All updates, evaluation
of matrix elements, generation of new basis, the Gram-
Schmidt orthonormalization, and diagonalization in our
algorithm are performed simultaneously with respect to
the k-points.

C. Other issues

We comment on the choice of the parameters. In this
study, we ﬁxed pmax to be 2, i.e., the max value of the
subspace dimension is 2n. We also ﬁxed Nupdate to be 3
for SCF calculations. We veriﬁed that these choices work
well both for accuracy and eﬃciency in this study.

For the BiTC method, we employ essentially the
same algorithm, but the orthonormalization condition
is replaced with the bi-orthonormalization conditions:
(cid:104)w(1,q)
(cid:105) = 1 (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n)
where w are the left trial vectors [43]. Note that the left
and right eigenvectors are obtained simultaneously in the
subspace diagonalization.

study [17] using an RPA formula were adopted in de-
termination of the Jastrow parameter A (Eq. (6)). Here
we used the same value of the static dielectric constants
independent of the treatment of core states for a fair com-
parison between with-core and without-core calculations.
Note that a value of N (see Eqs. (2) and (6)) is by deﬁ-
nition diﬀerent between with-core and without-core cal-
culations. Here, consistency of N between Eq. (2) and
Eq. (6) is required to describe a screening eﬀect through
the three-body terms in the TC Hamiltonian in a way
presented in our previous study [17].

Experimental

lattice parameters used in this study
were also the same as those in Ref. [17]. LDA calcu-
lations were performed with tapp code [52, 53] to make
an initial guess for TC orbitals. Subsequent TC calcula-
tions were performed with tc++ code [15, 16]. We also
used LDA orbitals as basis functions for TC orbitals in
Sec. IV B to compare its performance with that for cal-
culation using a plane-wave basis set. These calculations
are called LDA-basis and plane-wave-basis calculations
hereafter.

B. Eﬃciency of plane-wave-basis calculation

To see how eﬃciently our new algorithm works, we per-
formed band structure calculations for bulk silicon with
core states. This is because a regular setup, bulk sili-
con without core states, requires only a small number
of subspace dimension both for LDA-basis and plane-
wave-basis calculations and is not appropriate as a test
case here. In Figure 2, we present the convergence be-
havior of the band structure for bulk silicon with core
states in terms of the number of bands n, where the sub-
space dimension for diagonalization is n and npmax = 2n
for LDA-basis and plane-wave-basis calculations, respec-
tively (see Section III). Band gaps between the highest
valence and lowest conduction bands at the Γ point, that
between the highest valence band at the Γ point and the
lowest conduction band at the X point, and the valence
bandwidth at the Γ point are shown here. A cut-oﬀ en-
ergy of plane waves was 256 Ry, and a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point
mesh was used throughout this subsection. Convergence
of the total energy is also shown in Figure 3.

In these ﬁgures, we can see that LDA-basis calcula-
tions require an enormously large number of the sub-
space dimension. Even when we used 800 LDA bands,
the direct gap at the Γ point still exhibits an error of
about 0.8 eV compared with the well-converged value
obtained in plane-wave-basis calculation. Total energy
also shows much slower convergence in LDA-basis cal-
culation than in plane-wave-basis calculation. Because
one needs to take such a huge number of LDA bands
even for bulk silicon when one explicitly takes the core
states into account, LDA-basis calculation for more com-
plex materials such as strongly correlated systems seems
to be intractable both in computation time and memory
requirement. On the other hand, plane-wave-basis cal-

in LDA [49] calculations were used in this study. For Li,
C, and Si atoms, we used two types of pseudopotentials
for each: all-electron or [He]-core for Li and C, and [He]-
or [Ne]-core for Si. In this study, 1s core states of Si are
always included in the pseudopotential and not explicitly
treated. Even in ‘all-electron’ calculations, we used small
core radii (0.9 Bohr for H s state, 0.4 and 0.8 Bohr for
Li s and p states, and 0.2 Bohr for C s and p states,
respectively) for non-local projection. In this study, we
call calculations using smaller-core pseudopotentials for
each atomic species and those using larger-core ones
‘with-core’ and ‘without-core’ calculations, respectively.
We call the occupied states in ‘without-core’ calculations
valence states hereafter.

Singularities of the electron-electron Coulomb repul-
sion and the Jastrow function in the k-space were handled
with a method proposed by Gygi and Baldereschi [50] us-
ing an auxiliary function of the same form as Ref. [51].

plane-wave-basis calculations as noted in Section III, we
only show data for the band structure. We veriﬁed that
about 5 iterations are suﬃcient to obtain convergence
within an error of 0.1 eV for both basis sets in this case.
As for the computation time, one iteration takes about 60
and 22 hours without parallelization on our workstation
for LDA-basis and plane-wave-basis calculations, respec-
tively. Note that LDA-basis calculation with the number
of bands n = 800 still does not achieve suﬃcient con-
vergence as mentioned in the previous paragraph, which
means that, to achieve the same level of accuracy, LDA-
basis calculation needs much longer computation time
and larger memory requirement than plane-wave-basis
calculation.

C. Application to band structure calculations with

core states

As a test of our new algorithm, we investigated the
band structures with core states using a plane-wave ba-
sis set. Because accurate calculation of the total energy
with an explicit treatment of core electrons requires siz-
able computational eﬀort, we concentrate on the band
structures in this study.
In Figure 5, we present the band structures of LiH cal-
culated with the TC and BiTC methods using a 6× 6× 6
k-mesh and n = 20. We used 49 and 169 Ry for the cut-
oﬀ energy of plane waves in without-core and with-core
calculations, respectively. There is almost no diﬀerence
between the TC and BiTC band structures for this ma-
terial. We can see that the position of the valence band
is aﬀected by inclusion of core electrons, which improves
the agreement of the calculated band gap with experi-
mental one as presented in Table I [54]. Band structures
in the upper energy region are almost unchanged between
with-core and without-core calculations.

FIG. 3: Convergence of the total energy for bulk silicon with
core states in terms of the number of bands is presented for
LDA-basis and plane-wave-basis calculations. A line shows
the value corresponding to the rightmost data point for plane-
wave-basis calculations as a guide to the eyes.

culations require a moderate number of bands to achieve
suﬃcient convergence especially for the band structure
calculations.

Figure 4 presents the convergence behavior of the band
structure with respect to the number of iterations for
LDA-basis and plane-wave-basis calculations. LDA-basis
and plane-wave-basis calculations shown here were per-
formed with the number of bands n being 800 and 60,
respectively, where the convergence errors in calculations
with two basis sets are comparable using these values of
n as we have seen in Figs. 2 and 3. The number of it-
eration here denotes that for the outer loop described in
Section III for plane-wave-basis calculations. Since we
did not calculate the total energy at each iteration in

Such
development is a nontrivial task because of the diﬀer-

FIG. 5: (a) TC and (b) BiTC band structures of LiH with
(red solid lines) and without (blue broken lines) an explicit
treatment of the Li-1s core states. Conduction band bottoms
for both band dispersions are set to zero in the energy scale.

FIG. 6: (a) TC and (b) BiTC band structures of β-SiC with
(red solid lines) and without (blue broken lines) an explicit
treatment of the C-1s and Si-2s2p core states. Valence-band
tops for both band dispersions are set to zero in the energy
scale.

We also calculated the band structures of β-SiC as
shown in Figure 6 using a 4 × 4 × 4 k-mesh. Cutoﬀ
energies of 121 and 900 Ry and n = 30 and 40 were used
for without-core and with-core calculations, respectively.
We again see that an explicit inclusion of core electrons
makes the position of the deepest valence band a bit shal-
low. A similar trend is found also for Si, where the over-
estimated valence bandwidth is improved by an inclusion
of core states as presented in Table I. This feature can
be relevant to the observed overestimation of the valence
bandwidth for bulk silicon calculated with the state-of-
the-art diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method [56]. In the
upper energy region, band structures of β-SiC are again
almost unchanged but exhibit some diﬀerences between
with-core and without-core calculations. The diﬀerence
in the BiTC band structures can be interpreted as mere
shifts for each angular momentum. The TC band struc-
tures, on the other hand, show changes that are not con-
stant shifts. Note that these slight changes are natural
because our Jastrow factor is diﬀerent between with-core
and without-core calculations as mentioned before. Fur-
thermore, the LDA core states used to construct our LDA
pseudopotentials should be diﬀerent from those in the
TC and BiTC methods, which naturally can, in princi-
ple, produce complicated changes in the band structures.
In addition, the deep core states explicitly included in
the many-body wave function are expected to dominate
the wave-function optimization, which can aﬀect the ob-
tained eigenvalues in the upper energy region. It is note-
worthy that, nevertheless, the BiTC band structures are
always improved by an inclusion of deep core states as
shown in Table I, for materials we calculated here. The
position of the deepest valence bands is always improved
both for the TC and BiTC methods. Further investiga-
tion for diﬀerent materials is an important future issue.
It is also an important future issue to construct (Bi)TC
pseudopotentials that are free from the aforementioned

ence of the Jastrow factor among with/without-core cal-
culations for solids and atomic calculations required in
constructing the pseudopotentials, but the similarity be-
tween the band structures obtained in with-core and
without-core calculations is a hopeful observation for this
purpose.

V. SUMMARY

In this study, we develop an iterative diagonalization
scheme for solving an SCF equation of the TC method
using a plane-wave basis set. We make use of the block-
Davidson algorithm and verify that our new scheme eﬀec-
tively reduces computational requirement both in mem-
ory and time. Also an inﬂuence of the core states in the
TC calculations is investigated. We ﬁnd that an explicit
treatment of core states improves a position of deep va-
lence states whereas the band structures in upper energy
region do not exhibit large changes, which means that
our choice of the Jastrow factor can provide consistent
electronic structures for a wide energy range whether the
core electrons are explicitly treated or not. Our study
opens the way to further application of the TC method
to the strongly correlated systems.

[44] In the TC method, band structure calculation after the
regular SCF calculation is performed self-consistently.
This is because the singularities of the interaction in the
k-space were handled in the manner that requires the
one-body wave functions on the k-mesh used in the band-
structure plot.

[54] For LiH, note that our LDA pseudopotentials do not in-
clude the non-linear core correction [55] since its mean-
ing is ambiguous in the context of the TC method. This
can be an origin of a diﬀerence for the valence band-
widths obtained by with-core and without-core LDA cal-
culations presented in Table I. For other materials, the
calculated LDA band structures are almost unchanged
