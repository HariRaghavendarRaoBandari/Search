PARTICLE BASIS OF FEIGIN-STOYANOVSKY’S TYPE

SUBSPACES OF LEVEL 1 ˜slℓ+1(C)-MODULES

GORAN TRUP ˇCEVI ´C

Abstract. We construct particle basis for Feigin-Stoyanovsky’s type sub-
spaces of level 1 standard ˜slℓ+1(C)-modules. From the description we obtain
character formulas.

1. Introduction

A problem of ﬁnding a monomial basis of a standard module is part of the
Lepowsky-Wilson’s program of studying Rogers-Ramanujan type identities through
representation theory of aﬃne Lie algebras ([LW], [LP], [MP]). Description of basis
was used to obtain graded dimension of these modules, which gave the sum-side in
Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities.

B. Feigin and A. Stoyanovsky initiated another approach to Rogers-Ramanujan
type identities by considering what they called a principal subspace of a standard
˜sl2(C)-module ([FS]). These subspaces were further studied by G. Georgiev ([G]),
C. Calinescu, S. Capparelli, J. Lepowsky and A. Milas ([CLM1,2], [CalLM1,2,3],
[C1,2]), C. Sadowski ([S1,2]), E. Ardonne, R. Kedem and M. Stone ([AKS]).

Another type of principal subspace, called Feigin-Stoyanovsky’s type subspace,
was introduced and studied by M. Primc who constructed a basis of this sub-
space and from it he obtained basis of the whole standard module ([P1,2]). For
˜slℓ+1(C), these bases were parameterized by (k, ℓ + 1)-admissible conﬁgurations
([FJLMM]), combinatorial objects introduced and further studied by Feigin et al.
in [FJLMM] and [FJMMT], where bosonic and fermionic formulas for characters
were obtained. Primc and M. Jerkovic obtained fermionic formulas for characters
of standard ˜sl3(C)-modules by using intertwining operators and admissible conﬁg-
urations ([J2]), or by using quasi-particle bases [JP]). In our previous work ([T]),
we have used (1, ℓ + 1)-admissible conﬁgurations to combinatorially obtain charac-
ter formulas for Feigin-Stoyanovsky’s type subspaces of level 1 standard ˜slℓ+1(C)-
modules. In this note we use an approach similar to Georgiev and Jerkovi´c and
Primc to construct particle basis for Feigin-Stoyanovsky’s type subspaces of level 1
standard ˜slℓ+1(C)-modules. From this description we immediately obtain character
formulas.

2. Affine Lie algebra ˆslℓ+1(C)

Let g = slℓ+1(C) be a simple ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of type Aℓ. Fix a
Cartan subalgebra h ⊂ g and denote by R the corresponding root system; g has a
root decomposition g = h ⊕ `α∈R gα. Let Π = {α1, . . . , αℓ} be a basis of the root
system R, and let {ω1, . . . , ωℓ} be the corresponding set of fundamental weights,
hωi, αji = δij. Set ω0 = 0 for convenience. Let h·, ·i be a a normalized invariant

bilinear form on g; we identify h with h∗ via h·, ·i. Denote by Q the root lattice, and
by P the weight lattice of g. Also for each root α ∈ R ﬁx a root vector xα ∈ gα.

Let ˜g be the associated untwisted aﬃne Lie algebra ([K]),

˜g = g ⊗ C[t, t−1] ⊕ Cc ⊕ Cd.

Denote by x(m) = x ⊗ tm for x ∈ g, m ∈ Z, and deﬁne formal Laurent series
x(z) = Pm∈Z x(m)z−m−1. Denote by Λ0, . . . , Λℓ fundamental weights for ˜g.

Fix a minuscule weight ω = ωℓ and set

Γ = { α ∈ R | hα, ωi = 1} = {αi + · · · + αℓ | i = 1, . . . , ℓ}.

Denote by γi = αi + · · · + αℓ. Then

g = g−1 ⊕ g0 ⊕ g1,

g0 = h ⊕ X

hα,ωi=0

gα,

g±1 = X

is a Z-gradation of g. Subalgebras g1 and g−1 are commutative.

The Z-gradation of g gives the Z-gradation of the aﬃne Lie algebra ˜g:

˜g = ˜g−1 + ˜g0 + ˜g1,

˜g0 = g0 ⊗ C[t, t−1] ⊕ Cc ⊕ Cd,

˜g±1 = g±1 ⊗ C[t, t−1].

Again, ˜g−1 and ˜g1 are commutative subalgebras. We will call elements γ ∈ Γ colors
and we will say that xγ(−m) is an element of color γ and degree m.

Let L(Λr) be a standard (i.e.

integrable highest weight) ˜g-module of level 1.
Denote by vr the highest weight vector of L(Λr). Deﬁne a Feigin-Stoyanovsky’s
type subspace

W (Λr) = U (˜g1) · vr ⊂ L(Λr).

By Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem, we have a spanning set of W (Λr) consisting of
monomial vectors
(1)

{bvr | b = xℓ(−mℓ,nℓ) · · · x1(−m1,n1) · · · x1(−m1,1), mi,j+1 ≥ mi,j > 0, ni ≥ 0},

where we write xi instead of xγi , for short.

3. VOA construction

We brieﬂy recall the vertex operator algebra construction of standard ˜g-modules
L(Λr) from [FK], [S]. For details and notation we turn the reader to [FLM], [DL]
and [LL].

Consider tensor products VP = M (1) ⊗ C[P ] and VQ = M (1) ⊗ C[Q], where
M (1) is the Fock space for the Heisenberg subalgebra ˆhZ = Pn∈Z\{0} h ⊗ tn ⊕ Cc,
and C[P ] and C[Q] are group algebras of the weight and root lattice with bases
consisting of {eλ | λ ∈ P }, and {eα | α ∈ Q}, respectively. We identify C[P ] with
1 ⊗ C[P ] ⊂ VP .

Space VQ has a structure of vertex operator algebra and VP is a module for this

algebra:

(2)

Y (eλ, z) = E−(−λ, z)E+(−λ, z) ⊗ eλzλǫ(λ, ·),

where E±(λ, z) = exp(cid:16)Pm≥1 λ(±m)z∓m/±m(cid:17), eλ is a multiplication operator,
zλ · eµ = eµzhλ,µi and ǫ(·, ·) is a 2-cocycle (cf. [FLM]).
By using vertex operators, one can deﬁne the structure of ˜g-module on VP by
setting xα(z) = Y (eα, z) for α ∈ R. This gives VQ ≃ L(Λ0) and VQeωr ≃ L(Λr),
with highest weight vectors v0 = 1 and vr = eωr , and VP ∼= L(Λ0) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L(Λℓ).

2

From vertex operator formula (2) one easily obtains the following relations on

L(Λr)

(6)

x2
i (z) = 0,
xi(z)xj(z) = 0,

1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ,
1 ≤ i < j ≤ ℓ,

xi(m)vr = 0, m ≥ −δi≤r,

xr(−1)vr−1 = Ceωℓ+ωr = Ceωℓvr,

for some C ∈ C×. Here, δi≤j is 1 if i ≤ j, 0 otherwise.

For the proof of linear independence we will be using certain coeﬃcients of in-

tertwining operators

Y(eλ, z) = Y (eλ, z)eiπλc(·, λ),

for λ ∈ P , where c(·, λ) is a commutator map (cf.
[DL]). Let λi = ωi − ωi−1 for
i = 1, . . . , ℓ. From Jacobi identity ([DL]) we see that operators Y(eλi , z) commute
with the action of ˜g1. Deﬁne the following coeﬃcients of intertwining operators (cf.
[P3])

[i] = Res z−1−hλi,ωi−1iY(eλi , z),

for i = 1, . . . , ℓ. From (2), it follows (cf. [P3])

(7)

for some C ∈ C×.

[i]vi−1 = Cvi,

We will also be using simple current operators eωi, i = 1, . . . , ℓ. For α ∈ R and

λ ∈ P from (2) we get the following commutation relation

xα(z)eλ = ǫ(α, λ)zhα,λieλxα(z).

By comparing coeﬃcients, we get

xα(m)eλ = ǫ(α, λ)eλxα(m + hα, λi).

In particular, for α = γi and λ = ωj, we get

(8)

xi(m)eωj = ǫ(γi, ωj)eωj xi(m + δi≤j ).

4. Basis of W (Λr)

To reduce the spanning set (1) and to prove linear independence, we need a linear
order on monomials. Deﬁne a linear order xi(n) < xj(m) if either i > j or i = j
and n < m. We assume that in all monomials factors are sorted descendingly from
right to left, like in (1). We compare two monomials b1 and b2 by comparing their
factors from right to left (reverse lexicographic order): b1 < b2 if either b2 = bb1
or b1 = b′
2xj (m)b and xi(n) < xj(m), for some monomials b, b1, b2.
This linear order is compatible with multiplication: if b > c, then ab > ac.

1xi(n)b, b2 = b′

For a monomial b = xℓ(−mℓ,nℓ) · · · xℓ(−mℓ,1) · · · x1(−m1,n1) · · · x1(−m1,1) deﬁne
its degree, weight and length by d(b) = mℓ,nℓ + · · · + mℓ,1 + · · · + m1,n1 + · · · + m1,1,
w(b) = n1γ1 + · · · + nℓγℓ and l(b) = n1 + · · · + nℓ.

Theorem 1. A spanning set of W (Λr) is given by the set of monomial vectors (1)
satisfying initial conditions

(9)

mi,n ≥ 1 + X

i<j

ni + δj≤r

and diﬀerence conditions

(10)

mi,n+1 ≥ mi,n + 2,

1 ≤ n ≤ ni − 1.

3

Proof: Diﬀerence conditions follow from (3): Assume that b doesn’t satisfy (10).
Then b = b′xj(−m)xj (−m′), for some monomial b′ and m′ ≤ m ≤ m′ + 1. By (3)
and (5), on W (Λr) we have
xj(−m)xj (−m′) = C1xj (−m− 1)xj(−m′ + 1)+ · · · + Cm′−1xj (−m− m′ + 1)xj(−1),
for some Ci ∈ C×. Multiply this by b′ to obtain b expressed as a linear combination
of greater monomials of the same degree and weight.

Now assume that b doesn’t satisfy (9); let b = b2xj(−m)b1 where b1 contains all

factors of colors γ1, . . . , γj−1 and

m < 1 + X

i<j

ni + δj≤r.

We will prove that b can be expressed in terms of greater monomials of the same
degree and weight. The proof is done by induction on the length l(b1) = Pi<j ni.
If l(b1) = 0, then (5) gives xj(−m)vr = 0. Now, assume that all monomials a
with l(a1) < l(b1) can be expressed with greater monomials of the same degree and
weight. We can also assume that m = Pi<j ni + δj≤r. Let xk(−n) be the smallest
factor in b1; b1 = xk(−n)b′

1. By (4) and (5) we have

(11)

xj(−m)xk(−n) = C1+δj≤r xj (−1 − δj≤r)xk(−n − m + 1 + δj≤r) + . . .

+ Cm−1xj (−m + 1)xk(−n − 1) + Cm+1xj (−m − 1)xk(−n + 1) + . . .

for some Ci ∈ C. Multiply this with b2b′

1 and obtain

(12)

b = b2xj(−1 − δj≤r)xk(−n − m + 1 + δj≤r)b′

1 + . . .

+ b2xj(−m + 1)xk(−n − 1)b′

1 + b2xj(−m − 1)xk(−n + 1)b′

1 + . . .

On the right-hand side we have monomials

1, b2xj(−m − 2)xk(−n + 2)b′
which are greater than b. But we also have the ﬁrst few monomials

b2xj (−m − 1)xk(−n + 1)b′

1, . . .

1, . . . , b2xj(−m + 1)xk(−n − 1)b′
1.

b2xj(−1 − δj≤r)xk(−n − m + 1 + δj≤r)b′

(13)
Consider their factors xj(−1−δj≤r)b′
1. By the inductive assump-
tion, they can be expressed as linear combinations of greater monomials of the same
degree and weight. Then it is obvious that by multiplying these linear expressions
by b2xk(−n − m + 1 + δj≤r), . . . , b2xk(−n − 1) we obtain linear expressions for
monomials in (13) in terms of greater monomials. Moreover, these monomials will
also be greater than b. Hence, we have expressed b in terms of greater monomial.

Theorem 2. A spanning set

(14)

B = {bvr|b satisﬁes (10) and (9)}

is a basis of W (Λr).

Proof: Let b ∈ B. We ﬁrst prove a particular case: if

Cbvr = 0

then C = 0. We prove this by induction on degree of b. Let xi(−n) be the greatest
factor in b; b = b′xi(−n).

If i ≤ r then, since vr = eωr = eωr v0, we have

Cbvr = Cbeωr v0 = eωr C′Cb′′v0 = 0,

where C′ ∈ C× and b′′ is obtained from b by decreasing degrees of factors of color
γ1, . . . , γr by 1 (see (8)). Since eωr is injective, Cb′′v0 = 0. Monomial b′′ satisﬁes
diﬀerence and initial conditions for W (Λ0) and it is of a smaller degree then b. By
the inductive assumption, we conclude that C = 0.

4

If i > r and n > 1 then use operators [i][i − 1] · · · [r + 1] to obtain

Cbvi = 0.

Then, by (8),

Cbvi = Cbeωiv0 = eωiC′Cb′′v0 = 0,

where C′ ∈ C× and b′′ is obtained from b by decreasing degrees of factors of color
γi by 1 (see (7) and (8)). Again, b′′ satisﬁes diﬀerence and initial conditions for
W (Λ0) and it is of a smaller degree then b. By induction, we conclude that C = 0.

If i > r and n = 1 then use operators [i − 1] · · · [r + 1] to obtain

(see (7)). By (6) and (8), we have

Cbvi−1 = 0

Cb′xi(−1)vi = C′Cb′eωℓvi = eωℓC′′Cb′′vi = 0,

where C′, C′′ ∈ C× and b′′ is obtained from b′ by decreasing degrees of all factors
by 1. Monomial b′′ satisﬁes diﬀerence and initial conditions for W (Λi) and and it
is of a smaller degree then b. By induction, we conclude that C = 0.

Now turn to the general relation of linear dependence:

(15)

Cbbvr = 0.

X

b

Let bmin be the smallest monimial in (15). We use the same operators as in the
previous case to peel down Cbmin bminvr to Cbmin vj, for some j. Note that operators
that we used above at some point annihilate other monomial vectors in (15). We
will get

Cbmin vj = 0

and we conclude Cbmin = 0. We proceed inductively to conclude that all coeﬃcients
Cb in (15) are 0.
(cid:3)
From this combinatorial description of basis of W (Λr) we immediately obtain
character formulas (cf. [J1], [T]): for n1, . . . , nℓ ≥ 0, set α = n1γ1 + · · · + nℓγℓ and
W (Λr )(q) = Pi qicard {b | w(b) = α, d(b) = i}
