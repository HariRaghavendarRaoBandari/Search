dependent missingness in cluster randomised trials

Abstract

Attrition is a common occurrence in cluster randomised trials (CRTs)
which leads to missing outcome data. Two approaches for analysing such
trials are cluster-level analysis and individual-level analysis. This paper com-
pares the performance of unadjusted cluster-level analysis, baseline covariate
adjusted cluster-level analysis and linear mixed model (LMM) analysis, under
baseline covariate dependent missingness (CDM) in continuous outcomes, in
terms of bias, average estimated standard error and coverage probability. The
methods of complete case analysis (CCA) and multiple imputation (MI) are
used to handle the missing outcome data. Four possible scenarios are consid-
ered depending on whether the missingness mechanisms and covariate eﬀects
on outcome are the same or diﬀerent in the two intervention groups. We show
that both unadjusted cluster-level analysis and baseline covariate adjusted
cluster-level analysis give unbiased estimates of the intervention eﬀect only
if both intervention groups have the same missingness mechanisms and the
same covariate eﬀects, which is arguably unlikely to hold in practice. LMM
and MI give unbiased estimates under all four considered scenarios, provided
that an interaction of intervention indicator and covariate is included in the
model when the covariate eﬀects are diﬀerent in the two intervention groups.
MI gives slightly overestimation of average standard error, which leads to a
decrease in power.

Introduction

In cluster randomised trials (CRTs), identiﬁable clusters of individuals such as vil-
lages, schools, medical practices - rather than individuals - are randomly allocated to
each of intervention and control groups, while individual-level outcomes of interest
are observed within each cluster. The number of clusters and/or the cluster sizes
in each intervention group might be diﬀerent. CRTs with equal number of clusters

1

in each intervention group with constant cluster size are known as balanced CRTs.
One important characteristic of CRTs is that outcomes of individuals within the
same cluster may exhibit more similarity compared to the outcomes of individuals
in the other clusters, which is quantiﬁed by intraclass correlation coeﬃcient (ICC),
denoted by ρ. In practice, the resulting value of ICC is typically ranges form 0.001
to 0.05 and it is rare to have ICC above 0.1 [21]. Small values of ICC can lead to
a substantial amount of variance inﬂation factors and cannot be ignored [10, 20].
CRTs are being increasingly used in the ﬁelds of health promotion and health ser-
vice research. Reasons for such popularity may include the nature of intervention
that itself may dictate its application at the cluster level, less risk of intervention
contamination and high administrative convenience [9]. It is well known that the
power and precision of CRTs are lower relative to trials that individually randomise
the same number of individuals. In spite of having this limitation, the advantages
associated with CRTs are perceived by researchers to outweigh the resulting cost in
statistical power and precision in some situations.

Attrition is common in CRTs which leads to missing outcome data, that often
create a problem in the analysis of such trials. Not only do they cause a loss of
information and as a result usually reduce statistical power of the study, but also
they might be a potential source of bias in the parameter estimates [32]. Handling
missing data in CRTs is complicated by the fact that data are clustered. Inadequate
handling of the missing data may result in misleading inferences [28]. A systematic
review [7] revealed that, among all CRTs published in English in 2011, 72% trials
had missing values either in outcomes or in covariates or in both. Only 34% CRTs
of them reported how they handled missing data. One of the reasons may be that
the methodological development for dealing with missing data in CRTs has been
relatively slow in spite of the increasing popularity of CRTs.

The impact of missing data on estimation and inference of a parameter of interest
depends on the mechanism that caused missing data, the method used to handle
missing data, and the choice of statistical methods used for data analysis. In CRTs,
baseline covariates that might be related to the outcome of interest are often collected
and these are sometimes incorporated into the analysis, known as covariate adjusted
analysis. In some CRTs, a plausible working assumption may be that missingness
in outcomes depends on covariates measured at baseline, but not on the outcome
itself, known as covariate dependent missingness (CDM).

This paper addresses the question of under which conditions, using complete
case analysis (CCA), unadjusted cluster-level analysis, baseline covariate adjusted
cluster-level analysis and linear mixed model (LMM) analysis are valid when there is
missingness in a continuous outcome, with the probability of missingness depending
on baseline covariate values. We also compare the performance of these methods
using CCA with the performance of them applied to multiply imputed datasets.
Baseline covariates in CRTs could be either individual-level or cluster level. In this
paper we restrict attention to individual-level baseline covariates, and throughout

2

this paper whenever we say baseline covariate, we mean baseline individual-level
covariate, unless stated otherwise.

This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the ap-
proaches to the analysis of CRTs with complete data. In Section 3, the assumed
missingness mechanism for CRTs is described alongside a discussion about the pre-
vious works on missing data in CRTs. Section 4 describes the methods of handling
missing data in CRTs. In Section 5, we give results which show under what con-
ditions the various analyses give valid inferences. Section 6 describes a simulation
study and presents the results. In Section 7, we conclude with some discussion.

2 Analysis of CRTs with complete data

In this section, before considering the analysis of CRTs with missing outcome data,
we describe the two broad approaches to the analysis of CRTs in the absence of
missing data. These are cluster-level analysis and individual-level analysis.

2.1 Cluster-level analysis

Cluster-level analysis can be done in two ways: unadjusted cluster-level analysis and
baseline covariate adjusted cluster-level analysis. This approach can be explained
as a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage of unadjusted analysis, a relevant summary
measure of outcomes is calculated for each cluster. Then, in the second stage, the
two sets of cluster speciﬁc summary measures obtained in the ﬁrst stage are com-
pared using appropriate statistical methods. The most common one is the standard
t−test for two independent samples (here referred to as cluster-level t− test) with
degrees of freedom (DF) equal to the total number of clusters in the study minus
two. The basis of using this test is that the resulting summary measures are sta-
tistically independent, which is a consequence of the clusters being independent of
each other. In the case of baseline covariate adjusted analysis, an individual-level
regression analysis is carried out at the ﬁrst stage of analysis without considering
clustering of the data [12, 14]. In this ﬁrst stage, all covariates, except the inter-
vention indicator, are considered as explanatory variables into the regression model.
Individual level residuals are then used to calculate the cluster-speciﬁc summary
measures, which are then compared using cluster-level t−test in the second stage
of analysis to evaluate the intervention eﬀect adjusted for baseline covariates. The
main purposes of adjusting for covariates are to increase the credibility of the trial
ﬁndings by demonstrating that any observed intervention eﬀect is not attributed to
the possible imbalance between the intervention groups in term of baseline covari-
ates, and to improve the statistical power [15].

2.2

Individual-level analysis

In individual-level analysis, a regression model is ﬁtted to the individual-level out-
comes, with allowance for the fact that observations within the same cluster are
correlated. Two widely accepted approaches are random eﬀects models and gen-
eralised estimating equations (GEE). Random eﬀects models take into account of
between-cluster variability using cluster-level eﬀects which are assumed to follow a
speciﬁed probability distribution. The parameters of the regression model are es-
timated using maximum likelihood methods together with intervention eﬀect and
other covariates eﬀects, if any. Depending on the parameter of interest and the type
of outcome, the most commonly used random eﬀects models are linear mixed model
(LMM) for continuous outcomes, random eﬀects Poisson regression model for event
rates and random eﬀects logistic regression (RELR) model for binary outcomes [14].
Generalised estimating equations (GEE) oﬀers an alternative to random eﬀects mod-
els that take into account the correlation among the outcomes of the same cluster
using a working correlation matrix. GEEs are easier to ﬁt than random eﬀects mod-
els when the outcome is binary. The GEE method gives estimates of the marginal
(also known as population averaged) intervention eﬀect, whereas RELR gives es-
timates of the conditional (also known as cluster-speciﬁc) intervention eﬀect.
In
GEE, a reasonable large number of clusters in each group is needed to get reliable
results and it is recommended to have at least 40 clusters in the study to get reliable
standard errors of the estimates [22]. With small number of clusters in each group,
GEE may give underestimated standard errors of the estimated intervention eﬀect
using the sandwich variance estimator, that may lead to elevated Type I error.
The adjusted t−test, proposed by Donner and Klar (2000) [10], is a alternative
approach to test the intervention eﬀect for quantitative outcomes by comparing
the means of intervention groups using individual-level data. This test is a simple
extension of the standard t−test, which allows for correlation in outcomes. The
adjusted t−test and the cluster-level t−test are identical for balanced CRTs.

3 Missingness mechanism assumptions for CRTs

In statistical analysis, if there are missing values, an assumption must be made
about missingness mechanism, which refers to the relationship between missingness
and the values of the variables in the data [17]. According to Rubin’s framework
[24], a missingness mechanism can be classiﬁed as (i) missing completely at random
(MCAR), where the probability of a value being missing is independent of the ob-
served and unobserved data, (ii) missing at random (MAR), where conditioning on
the observed data, the probability of a value being missing is independent of the
unobserved data, and (iii) missing not at random (MNAR), where the probability of
value being missing depends on both observed and unobserved data. In this paper,
we will consider the common setting where some outcomes (continuous) are missing.

4

In CRTs, an assumption that may sometimes be plausible is that missingness in
outcomes depends on covariates measured at baseline, but conditional on these, not
on the outcomes itself, known as covariate dependent missingness (CDM). For ex-
ample, blood pressure outcome data could be CDM if missingness in blood pressure
measurement depends on covariates (e.g. age, BMI or weight), but given these, not
on the blood pressure measurement itself. CDM is an example of a MAR mechanism
when covariates are fully observed.

Let Yijl be a continuous outcome of interest for the lth (l = 1, 2, . . . , mij) individ-
ual in the jth (j = 1, 2, . . . , ki) cluster of the intervention group i (i = 1, 2), where
i = 1 corresponds to control group and i = 2 corresponds to intervention group. We
assume that the Yijl follow a linear mixed model given by

Yijl = αi + βiXijl + δij + ijl,

(3.1)

where αi is a constant for ith intervention group, Xijl is a baseline covariate value
for (ijl)th individual, βi is the eﬀect of covariate X on Y in intervention group i, δij
is the (ij)th cluster eﬀect and ijl is the individual error term. We also assume that
the cluster eﬀect (δij) and the individual error (ijl) are statistically independent;
and E (δij) = 0, Var (δij) = σ2
b and σ2
w
are the between-cluster variance and within-cluster variance, respectively. Later we
will sometimes make normality assumptions on these random eﬀects/random errors.
Suppose the covariate X has mean µx. Then

b and E (ijl) = 0, Var (ijl) = σ2

w, where σ2

where ¯Yi = (1/ki)(cid:80)ki

j=1(1/mij)(cid:80)mij

E(cid:0) ¯Yi

(cid:1) = αi + βiµx = µi(say),
l=1 Yijl = (1/ki)(cid:80)ki

¯Yij. Here, ¯Yi and ¯Yij are
the mean outcome of the ith intervention group and the (ij)th cluster, respectively.
With complete data, the cluster-level analysis estimate of the intervention eﬀect,
say ˆθ, is then calculated as

j=1

With complete data, this estimator is unbiased for the true intervention eﬀect, that
is,

Suppose there are some missing values for outcome Y . Deﬁne a missing data indi-
cator Rijl such that

ˆθ = ¯Y1 − ¯Y2.

E(ˆθ) = µ1 − µ2.

(cid:40)

Rijl =

1, if Yijl is observed
0, if Yijl is missing .

Then (cid:80)mij

l=1 Rijl is the number of observed values in the (ij)th cluster. The CDM

assumption can then be expressed as

P (Rijl = 0|Y ij, X ij) = P (Rijl = 0|Xijl),

5

where Y ij = (Yij1, Yij2, . . . , Yijmij ) and X ij = (Xij1, Xij2, . . . , Xijmij ) are the vectors
of the outcomes and the covariate values, respectively, in the (ij)th cluster. In other
words, the missingness of the (ijl)th individual’s outcome Yijl depends only on that
individual’s covariate value Xijl.

4 Methods of handling missing data in CRTs

Common approaches for handling missing data in CRTs include complete case anal-
ysis (CCA), single imputation and multiple imputation (MI). In this paper, we
focused on CCA and MI since they are the most commonly used methods now for
handling missing data. Next we describe these two approaches brieﬂy considering
missingness in outcomes only.

4.1 Complete case analysis

In complete case analysis (CCA), only cases with outcome observed are considered
in the analysis, while cases with missing outcome are excluded. It is widely used be-
cause of its simplicity and is usually the default method of most statistical packages.
It is well known that CCA is valid if data are MCAR or if missingness is indepen-
dent of the outcome, conditional on covariates [17]. Likelihood based CCA is valid
under MAR, if missingness is only in the outcome and all predictors of missingness
are conditioned on in the model [17]. CCA is also valid under MNAR mechanisms
where missingness in a covariate is dependent on the value of that covariate, but is
conditionally independent of outcome [31, 3]

4.2 Single imputation

Instead of discarding incomplete cases, single imputation imputes a single value
for each missing outcome and creates a complete data set. Two choices for single
imputation that have been considered in CRTs are group mean imputation and
cluster mean imputation [29]. In the ﬁrst case, missing outcomes in each intervention
group are replaced by the mean outcome calculated using complete cases (CCs)
pooled across clusters of that group. This approach reduces the variability among
the clusters means [29] and, therefore, gives inﬂated Type I error. In cluster mean
imputation, missing outcomes in each cluster are replaced by the mean outcome
calculated using CCs of that cluster. This approach has been suggested as a good
approach for handling missing outcomes under MCAR by Taljaard et al. [29]. They
showed that cluster mean imputation gives Type I error close to nominal level (5%)
under MCAR, using adjusted t−test with balanced CRTs. However, under MAR
or CDM, adjusted t−test may not be valid. We note that, with balanced CRTs,
the cluster-level t−test and the adjusted t−test are identical with cluster mean
imputation since after imputation the cluster sizes become constant and the cluster

6

means remain unchanged. Consequently, our later results for the validity of cluster
level t-test can also be applied to infer the validity of results after using cluster
mean imputation. One problem with cluster mean imputation is that it distorts the
estimates of between-cluster variability and within-cluster variability, which often
are of interest.

4.3 Multiple imputation

Multiple imputation (MI), ﬁrst proposed by Rubin (1987) [25], is a method of ﬁlling
in the missing outcomes multiple times by simulating from an appropriate model.
The aim of imputing multiple times is to allow for the uncertainty about the missing
outcomes due to the fact that the imputed values are sampled draws for the missing
outcomes. A sequence of Q imputed data sets are obtained by replacing each missing
outcome by a set of Q ≥ 2 imputed values that are simulated from an appropriate
distribution or model. Each of the Q data sets are then analysed as a completed
data set using a standard method. The results from the Q imputed data sets are
then combined using Rubin’s rules [25]. The combined inference is based on a
t−distribution with DF given by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)2

ν = (Q − 1)

1 +

Q

Q + 1

WMI
BMI

,

(4.1)

is the between-imputation variance and WMI

is the average within-
where BMI
imputation variance. This formula for DF is derived under the assumption that
the complete data DF, νcom, is inﬁnite [2].

In CRTs, νcom is usually small as it is based on the number of clusters in each
intervention group rather than the number of individuals. For unadjusted cluster-
level analysis and individual-level baseline covariate adjusted cluster-level analysis,
νcom is calculated as k1 + k2 − 2 for statistical inference using cluster-level t−test
[14] and adjusted t−test [29]. An adjustment is made to the νcom to adjust for
cluster-level baseline covariates using cluster-level analysis. In this case, we reduce
the complete data DF from νcom = k1 + k2 − 2 to νcom = k1 + k2 − 2 − p, where p is
the number of parameters corresponding to the cluster-level covariates in the ﬁrst
stage regression model [14].
When νcom is small and there is a modest proportion of missing data, the
repeated-imputation DF, ν (given in 4.1), for reference t− distribution can be much
higher than νcom, which is not appropriate [2]. In such a situation, a more appro-
priate DF, νadj, proposed by Barnard and Rubin (1999) [2], is calculated as

where

At least four diﬀerent types of MI have been used in CRTs [7]. These are stan-
dard MI which ignores clustering, ﬁxed eﬀects MI which includes a ﬁxed eﬀect for
each cluster in the imputation model, random eﬀects MI where clustering is taken
into account through random eﬀects in the imputation model and within-cluster MI
where standard MI is applied within each cluster. Andridge [1] showed, with bal-
anced CRTs under MCAR and MAR missingness in a continuous outcome with a
single covariate in addition to intervention indicator, that MI models that incorpo-
rate clustering using ﬁxed eﬀects for cluster can result in a serious overestimation
of variance of group means and this overestimation is more serious for small cluster
sizes and small ICCs. This overestimation of variance results in a decrease in power,
which is particularly dangerous for CRTs which are often underpowered [1]. The
MI using random eﬀects for cluster gave slight overestimation of variance of group
means for very small values of ρ. Andridge also showed that using an MI model
that ignores clustering can lead to severe underestimation of the MI variance for
large values of ρ (>0.005). This underestimation of variance leads to inﬂated Type
I error.

Taljaard et al.

[29] examined the performance of MI in a simple set-up con-
sidering balanced CRTs where there are no covariates except intervention indicator
using standard regression imputation, which ignores clustering, and random eﬀects
MI which does account for intraclass correlation. They also considered the Approx-
imate Bayesian Bootstrap (ABB) procedure, proposed by Rubin and Schenker [26],
as a non-parametric MI. In ABB, sampling from the posterior predictive distribution
of missing data is approximated by ﬁrst generating a set of plausible contributors
drawn with replacement from the observed data, and then imputed values are drawn
with replacement from the possible contributors. Two possible uses of ABB in CRTs
are pooled ABB and within-cluster ABB, where the set of possible contributors are
sampled from all observed values across the clusters in each group or from observed
values in the same cluster, respectively. They showed that none of these four MI
procedures tend to yield better power compared to the power of adjusted t−test
using no imputation and cluster mean imputation under MCAR.

In the case of missing outcome under MAR for non-clustered trials, Groenwold et
al. [13] showed that CCA with covariate adjustment and MI give similar estimates so
long as the same set of predictors of missingness are used. The CCA with covariate
adjustment has the advantage of being easier to apply compared to MI.

Ma et al.

[18] examined the performance of within-cluster MI and ﬁxed eﬀect
MI to estimate the intervention eﬀect and its conﬁdence interval through a sim-
ulation study in the case of missing binary outcomes in CRTs.
In within-cluster
MI, standard MI strategies, which includes logistic regression method, propensity
score method and normal based Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, were applied
within each cluster. The ﬁxed eﬀect MI considers a ﬁxed eﬀect for each cluster.
They considered MCAR and CDM mechanisms in balanced CRTs. They showed
that all these strategies give quite similar results for low percentages of missing data

8

or for small value of ICC. But with high percentage of missing data, the standard
MI strategies underestimate the variance of the intervention eﬀect which may re-
sult in inﬂated Type I error. In a subsequent study again by Ma et al.
[19], the
performance of GEE and RELR were compared considering a balanced CRT with
missing binary outcomes using standard MI and within-cluster MI. GEE was found
to perform well - using complete case analysis with small proportion of missing
data; using standard MI with variance inﬂation factor (VIF) less than 3; and using
within-cluster MI with VIF ≥ 3 and cluster size at least 50. They also concluded
that RELR performs well only when the percentage of missing data is small and it
doesn’t perform well with standard MI or with within-cluster MI. In another study,
Caille et al. [5] demonstrated diﬀerent MI strategies for handing missing binary data
in CRTs to assess bias, standard error and coverage probability of the population
averaged intervention eﬀect. They considered CCA, baseline adjusted CCA, single
and multiple imputation approaches. Results showed that MI with RELR model or
with standard logistic regression model gave unbiased estimates of the population
averaged intervention eﬀect and good coverage probability as well, although the lat-
ter method produced slightly lower estimate of coverage probability. All of these
studies done by Ma et al. [18, 19] and Caille et al. [5] considered a relatively high
number of clusters in each intervention group.

5 Analysis of CRTs with missing data

In this section, we describe the unadjusted cluster-level analysis, baseline covariate
adjusted cluster-level analysis and linear mixed model analysis methods using CCs,
and derive conditions under which they give valid inferences under CDM assumption.

5.1 Unadjusted cluster-level analysis using CCs

The mean of the observed outcomes in the ith intervention group can be calculated
as

with observed outcomes, and 1/ηi = E (1/(cid:80)

where µxi1 is true mean of the baseline covariate X in the ith intervention group
among those individuals with observed outcomes, σ2
is the variance of ¯xi1, the
¯xi1
sample mean of X values in the ith intervention group among those individuals
l Rijl). Hence, the estimator (5.1) will
be unbiased if β1 = β2 and µx11 = µx21. In other words, the unadjusted cluster-level
analysis is unbiased only if the two intervention groups have the same missingness
mechanisms and the same covariate eﬀects.

5.2 Adjusted cluster-level analysis using CCs

Let ˆijl be the estimated residual for (ijl)th individual. Then

ˆijl = Yijl − ˆYijl,

where ˆYijl = γ + λXijl is the predicted outcome for the (ijl)th individual. The mean
of the observed residuals of the ith group is given by

given by

l=1 Rijl

(5.4)

We show in Appendix B that

(cid:16)ˆθobs

E

= µ1 − µ2 + β1 (µx11 − µx) − β2 (µx21 − µx) + λ (µx21 − µx11) .

(5.5)

Hence, the estimator (5.4) will be unbiased if (i) β1 = β2 and µx11 = µx21, or if
(ii) λ = β1 = β2. Equation (5.5 ) is derived (see Appendix B) assuming ﬁxed
values of γ and λ instead of their estimates.
In practice, γ and λ are unknown
and must be estimated by ﬁtting a ﬁrst stage regression model for the observed
outcomes, where all covariates except the intervention indicator are included in the
regression model, and clustering is ignored. We are not worried about the estimate
of the intercept parameter γ since the expression (5.5) is independent of γ. If λ is
estimated consistently, then ˆθobs
adj will be a consistent estimator of intervention eﬀect
when in truth λ = β1 = β2. The estimator of λ, say ˆλ, is calculated using CCs,
and will be unbiased (and therefore consistent) if Rijl ⊥ Yijl|Xijl. This is true only

10

when the two intervention groups have the same missingness mechanisms and the
same covariate eﬀects. Therefore, assuming CDM, the baseline covariate adjusted
cluster-level analysis is consistent only if the two intervention groups have the same
covariate eﬀects and the same missingness mechanisms.

The variance of the estimator (5.4) can be written as (see Appendix B for deriva-

tion)

2(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:19)

This shows that when β1 = β2 and the missingness mechanisms are the same in the
two intervention groups, in order for the estimator (5.4) to have minimum variance
one should replace the unknown λ by an estimate of β1 = β2 = β(say).

5.3 Linear mixed model using CCs

Let Z be the intervention indicator which is zero for control group and is one for
intervention group. When it is assumed that the two intervention groups have the
same covariate eﬀects, we ﬁt a LMM with ﬁxed eﬀects of X and Z, and a random
eﬀect for cluster. Then the estimate of the coeﬃcient of Z will be the estimated
intervention eﬀect accounting for X.

If one thinks that the covariate eﬀects could be diﬀerent in the two intervention
groups, an interaction of X and Z must be included in the model. This implies
that the intervention eﬀect varies with X. Then the estimate of the intervention
eﬀect at the mean value of X is known as average intervention eﬀect. Let X∗ denote
the empirically centred variable X − ¯X. If the covariate eﬀects are assumed to be
diﬀerent in the two groups, we ﬁt a LMM with ﬁxed eﬀects of X∗, Z and their
interaction, and a random eﬀect for cluster. The estimate of the coeﬃcient of Z will
then be the estimated average intervention eﬀect.

In the general theory of LMM, the variance of the ﬁxed eﬀects parameter es-
timates, which are calculated based on their asymptotic distributions, are known
to be underestimated for small sample sizes [16]. In practice, for testing hypothe-
ses about ﬁxed-eﬀects parameters, this resulting downward bias is often handled
by using approximate t−statistic and F−statistic [30]. An approximate t−test
can be obtained by approximating the distribution of t−statistic by an appropriate
t−distribution. Satterthwaite [27] proposed an approximation to calculate the DF
of the t−distribution. For testing hypotheses of the form H0 : Lκ = 0, where κ is a
vector of ﬁxed-eﬀects parameters and L is any known matrix, Kenward and Roger
[16] suggested a scaled Wald statistic as well as an F approximation of its sampling
distribution that performs well for small sample size. The suggested statistic uses
an adjusted estimate of the variance-covariance matrix that has reduced small sam-
ple bias than the standard asymptotic variance-covariance estimate. The numerator
DF of the approximate F−distribution equals rank(L) and the denominator DF is
calculated via a satterthwaite - type approximation [30]. For only one ﬁxed eﬀect in

11

the model, Kenward and Roger’s approximation essentially recovers Satterthwaite’s
approximation [16]. Both these approximation are applicable for linear mixed mod-
els and related multivariate normally based models [11]. As far as we are aware no
study has been done to compare these two approximations in CRTs. We have con-
ducted a simulation study to examine the performance of these two approximations
for DF and the complete data DF, νcom = k1 + k2 − 2, for testing hypothesis of ﬁxed
eﬀect in the case of balanced CRTs with only covariate Z (not X). Missingness in
outcome was considered under MCAR and CDM (missingness depends on interven-
tion indicator). A LMM was ﬁtted using both complete data and CCA. We used
z−test and Wald t−test (using Satterthwaite, Kenward-Roger’s and νcom DF) for
testing hypothesis about the ﬁxed eﬀect of Z. Results (not presented in the paper)
showed that the z−test tends to have inﬂated Type I error rates for small k using
both complete data and CCA. The Wald t−test with all the three DFs yields Type
I error rates close to the nominal level at all considered values of k, m and ρ. Both
tests result in acceptable Type I error rate for k > 15.

6 Simulation Study

A simulation study was conducted to investigate the performance of unadjusted and
baseline covariate adjusted cluster-level analyses, LMM and MI under baseline co-
variate dependent missingness in outcomes. The average estimate of intervention
eﬀect, its average estimated standard error (SE) and coverage probability were cal-
culated and compared to each other. We considered balanced CRTs, where the two
intervention groups have equal number of clusters (ki = k) and constant cluster size
(mij = m).

6.1 Data generation and analysis

For each individual in the study a single covariate value X was generated indepen-
dently as X ∼ N (0, 1). Since σ2
x = 1, we can write the coeﬃcient of X in (3.1) as
βi = τiσy, where σ2
y is the total variance of Y within each intervention group and
τi is the correlation coeﬃcient between Y and X in intervention group i. We ﬁxed
σ2
y = 100, α1 = 20 and α2 = 25. Then the outcome Y was generated using the
model

Yijl = αi + τiσyXijl + δij + ijl,

i − ρ)σ2

y) and ijl ∼ N (0, (1 − τ 2

where δij ∼ N (0, ρσ2
y). We chose the cluster size
m = 30 for each cluster. Parameters that were varied in generating the data include
the number of clusters in each group, k = (5, 10, 20, 30) and the unconditional
ICC, ρ = (0.001, 0.05, 0.1). In addition, we considered τ1 = τ2 = 0.5 to have the
same covariate eﬀects in the two intervention groups, and τ1 = 0.4, τ2 = 0.6 to have
diﬀerent covariate eﬀects in the two intervention groups. The missing data indicators

12

Rijl under CDM assumption were generated, independently for each individual,
according to a logistic regression model

(6.1)

logit(cid:0)Rijl = 0(cid:12)(cid:12)Y ij, X ij

(cid:1) = φi0 + φi1Xijl.

The intercept φi0 and slope φi1 were chosen so that Ejl (Rijl) = pi, where pi is
the desired proportion of missing values in intervention group i. The degree of
correlation between missingness and covariate depends on the value of φi1. We used
φ11 = φ21 = 1, which gives odds ratio=exp(1) = 2.72, that is, the odds ratio for
having a missing outcome (Y ) is 2.72 associated with a one unit increase in the
covariate (X) value. Missing data indicators were then imposed to each generated
complete data to get the incomplete data.

Four possible scenarios were considered depending on the eﬀects of covariate on

outcome and missingness mechanism in the two intervention groups.

1. The two intervention groups have the same missingness mechanisms and the

same covariate eﬀects.

2. The two intervention groups have diﬀerent missingness mechanisms but the

same covariate eﬀects.

3. The two intervention groups have diﬀerent covariate eﬀects but the same miss-

ingness mechanisms.

4. The two intervention groups have diﬀerent missingness mechanisms and dif-

ferent covariate eﬀects.

In the ﬁrst and third scenarios, we chose φ10 = φ20 = −1 and φ11 = φ21 = 1 so
that there was 30% missing outcomes in both groups. In the second and fourth sce-
narios, we chose φ10 = −1, φ11 = 1 so that there was 30% missing outcomes in the
control group, and φ20 = 0.5, φ21 = 1 so that there was 60% missing outcomes in the
intervention group. Each generated incomplete data set was then analysed using un-
adjusted cluster-level analysis, baseline covariate adjusted cluster-level analysis and
LMM using CCs. We included the interaction between intervention indicator and
covariate into the LMM in the third and fourth scenarios, where the two intervention
groups have diﬀerent covariate eﬀects.

The R package jomo [23] was used to multiply impute each generated incomplete
data set using MI with number of imputations 20. A random intercept LMM was
used as the imputation model so that the imputation model was correctly speci-
ﬁed. We used 200 burn-in iterations and 10 iterations between two successive draws
after examining, respectively, the convergence of the posterior distributions of the
parameters estimates of the imputation model and the plots of their autocorrelation
functions. The completed data sets were then analysed using LMM. An interaction
between intervention indicator and covariate was included in both the imputation
model and the analysis model when the covariate eﬀects were diﬀerent in the two

13

intervention groups. We always used the restricted maximum likelihood estimation
method to ﬁt the LMM. The Wald t−test with adjusted DF, given in equation 4.2,
with νcom = 2(k − 1) was used to test the null hypothesis of intervention eﬀect. We
had some convergence warning messages ( 33-50 out of 10000 simulations) when the
LMM was ﬁtted using the R package lme4 [4].

6.2 Results

Empirical average estimates of intervention eﬀect, average estimated standard errors
(SEs) and coverage probabilities of nominal 95% interval over 10000 simulation runs
for all the four scenarios are presented in Tables 1 to 4.

When the two intervention groups have the same missingness mechanisms and
the same covariates eﬀects, both the unadjusted and baseline covariate adjusted
analyses gave

unbiased estimates of intervention eﬀect with coverage probabilities very close to
the nominal level (see Table 1). But these two methods gave biased estimates of
intervention eﬀect if the two intervention groups have either diﬀerent missingness
mechanisms or diﬀerent covariate eﬀects or both (see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4,
respectively). These results support our derived results in Section 5.1 and Section
5.2. These results also imply

that the adjusted t−test with cluster mean imputation (described in Section 4.2 )
is not valid under CDM assumption unless the two intervention groups have the
same missingness mechanisms and the same covariate eﬀects. The bias in average
intervention eﬀect estimates could be in either direction. But, in this paper, we
always have downward bias in the reported intervention eﬀect estimates. This is be-
cause we considered, in the data generation process, a positive correlation between
covariate and outcome, and a positive association between covariate and probability
of missingness in outcomes. As a result, a large value of outcome has higher chance
of being missing compared to a low value of outcome. In our simulations the degree
of bias was high if the two intervention groups have diﬀerent covariate eﬀects and
it goes up if, in addition, the two intervention groups have diﬀerent missingness
mechanisms (see Table 3 and Table 4). LMM and MI gave unbiased estimates of in-
tervention eﬀect under all the four considered scenarios, provided that an interaction
of intervention indicator and covariate was included in the model

allow for diﬀerent covariate eﬀects in the two intervention groups (scenario 3 and
4).

The LMM and MI had similar empirical SEs (results not presented) of the inter-
vention eﬀect estimates. But the MI gave slightly overestimation of SEs for small
values of ρ and k, which leads to a decrease in power. This agrees with the results for
variance estimates of group means in previous studies [1]. The LMM gave coverage
probabilities close to nominal level except very small ρ and small k, where it showed
slightly overcoverage.

The average estimates of adjusted DF (νadj), used by MI, over 10000 simulations
runs and the calculated complete data DF (νcom) for scenario 4 are presented in
Table 5. Results showed that there was a severe underestimation of νadj compared
to the νcom, and that the underestimation is more severe for small values of ρ. This
underestimation of νadj with the overestimation of SEs resulted in overcoverage for
MI.

7 Discussion and Conclusion

Cluster randomised trials have increasingly being accepted to evaluate interventions
which are usually applied at the cluster level instead of individual level in health
service research. The risk of attrition in such trials might be high due to lack of
direct contact with participants and often lengthy follow-up period [8].
In such
trials, a plausible working assumption, particularly if baseline covariates are col-
lected which are related to missingness, that missingness in outcome depends on
covariates measured at baseline, but not on the outcome itself, known as covariate
dependent missingness. Adjustment for baseline covariates in CRTs can increase
power to detect a intervention eﬀect. Cluster-level analysis is widely used by ap-
plied researchers because of its simplicity. In this paper, we focused on selection of
an analysis method for CRTs where outcome (continuous) is missing under covariate

dependent missingness. We found that unadjusted cluster-level analysis and base-
line covariate adjusted cluster-level analysis give unbiased estimates of intervention
eﬀect only if both intervention groups have the same missingness mechanisms and
the same covariate eﬀects, which is a very strong assumption about missingness in
CRTs and is arguably unlikely to hold in practice. We therefore caution researchers
that these methods may commonly give biased inferences in CRTs suﬀering from
missingness in outcomes. The LMM and MI gave unbiased estimates of interven-
tion eﬀect regardless of whether missingness mechanisms and covariate eﬀects are
same or diﬀerent in two groups, provided that an interaction between intervention
indicator and covariate was included in the model. According to Groenwold [13],
there is little to be gained by using MI over LMM in the absence of auxiliary vari-
ables. This is due to the fact that when missingness is conﬁned to outcomes, mixed
models ﬁtted using maximum likelihood are fully eﬃcient and valid under MAR.
Consequently, in the absence of auxiliary variables, LMM can be recommended as
the primary analysis approach for CRTs with missing outcomes if one is willing to
assume make the CDM assumption.

Throughout this paper, we have assumed CDM mechanism in a continuous out-
come, which is an example of MAR as our baseline covariate was fully observed.
In practice, we can not deﬁnitely identify on the basis of the observed data which
missingness assumption is appropriate [31, 6]. Therefore, in practice, ideally sensi-
tivity analyses should be performed [6, Ch. 10] to explore whether our inferences
