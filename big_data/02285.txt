ABSTRACT

The large-scale distribution of galaxies is generally analyzed using the two-point correlation function.
However, this statistic does not capture the topology of the distribution, and it is necessary to resort
to higher order correlations to break degeneracies. We demonstrate that an alternate approach using
network analysis can discriminate between topologically diﬀerent distributions that have similar two-
point correlations. We investigate two galaxy point distributions, one produced by a cosmological
simulation and the other by a L´evy walk, that have diﬀerent topologies but yield the same power-law
two-point correlation function. For the cosmological simulation, we adopt the redshift z = 0.58 slice
from Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 2014A) and select galaxies with stellar masses greater than 108M⊙.
The two point correlation function of these simulated galaxies follows a single power-law, ξ(r) ∼ r−1.5.
Then, we generate L´evy walks matching the correlation function and abundance with the simulated
galaxies. We ﬁnd that, while the two simulated galaxy point distributions have the same abundance
and two point correlation function, their spatial distributions are very diﬀerent; most prominently,
ﬁlamentary structures, which are present in the simulation are absent in L´evy fractals. To quantify
these missing topologies, we adopt network analysis tools and measure diameter, giant component,
and transitivity from networks built by a conventional friends-of-friends recipe with various linking
lengths. Unlike the abundance and two point correlation function, these network quantities reveal a
clear separation between the two simulated distributions; therefore, the galaxy distribution simulated
by Illustris is not a L´evy fractal quantitatively. We ﬁnd that the described network quantities oﬀer an
eﬃcient tool for discriminating topologies and for comparing observed and theoretical distributions.

1. INTRODUCTION

Throughout the history of the Universe, various geo-
metrical and topological features have formed, evolved,
and vanished in the cosmic energy and matter distribu-
tion. It is undeniably critical to quantify and measure
such features, since many of them can provide deﬁnitive
probes for constraining important cosmological parame-
ters.

During the past two decades, studies of anisotropic
features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
speciﬁcally acoustic peaks, have motivated the so-called
Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology as a standard
paradigm (e.g., Hinshaw et al. 2013, Aghanim et al.
2015) and made a new step forward in precision cosmol-
ogy. Various experiments (Levi et al. 2013, Delubac et
al. 2015, Zhao et al. 2015), currently beginning or under-
way, are mapping out the expansion history of the Uni-

verse with unprecedented accuracy, by measuring baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO). These experiments will also
result in the most detailed maps of the large-scale galaxy
distribution over a wide range in redshifts, from z ∼ 0 to
z ∼ 3.

The successes of measuring CMB acoustic peaks and
BAO features demonstrate how important the two-point
correlation functions (or power spectra) are for quanti-
fying cosmic structures. Higher order n−point correla-
tion statistics are essential for analyzing cosmic struc-
tures. For example, the three and four point correlation
functions (or, bi- and tri-spectra) can constrain the non-
Gaussianity of primordial quantum ﬂuctuations (Barkats
et al. 2014, Ade et al. 2015); however, these measures are
computationally challenging (e.g., Kulkarni et al. 2007,
Gil-Mar´ın et al. 2015).

Along with the successful n−point statistics, many
topological measurements have been introduced, such as
genus numbers and Minkowski functionals (Gott, Wein-
berg & Melott 1987, Eriksen et al. 2004). To identify
voids and ﬁlaments, various methods have been adapted
from other ﬁelds of science, including minimum-spanning
trees, watersheds, Morse theory, wavelets, and smoothed
Hessian matrices (e.g., Barrow, Bhavsar & Sonoda 1985,
Sheth et al. 2003, Mart´ınez et al. 2005, Arag´on-Calvo
et al. 2007, Colberg 2007, Sousbie et al. 2008, Bond,
Strauss & Cen 2010, Lidz et al. 2010, Cautun et al.
2013). While these topological diagnostics have provided
important insights into the nature of structure in the
Universe, this wide but heterogeneous range of applied
methodologies reﬂects how diﬃcult it is to ﬁnd a consis-
tent and comprehensive framework for quantifying and

2

Hong et al.

measuring the topology of the Universe, in contrast to
the successful n−point statistics.

Many of these studies generate a continuous density
ﬁeld by smoothing the galaxy point distribution and then
measuring geometric topologies of genus numbers and
Minkowski functionals. Our approach, which we term
“network cosmology”, is to characterize the topology of
the discrete point distribution directly using graph the-
ory and network algorithms.

As a pilot study to explore new ways to quantify cosmic
topologies, Hong & Dey (2015; hereafter, HD15) applied
the analysis tools developed for the study of complex
networks (e.g. Albert & Barab´asi 2002, Newman 2010)
to the study of the large-scale galaxy distribution. The
basic idea is to generate a graph (i.e., a “network”) com-
posed of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) from a galaxy
distribution, and then measure network quantities used
in graph theory. In this paper, we demonstrate the util-
ity of these techniques for diﬀerentiating between point
distributions that have identical two-point correlations
but diﬀerent spatial distributions and topologies.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In §2, as a more
speciﬁc introduction to this paper, we oﬀer a general
discussion about what types of features can be measured
from galaxy survey data, the strong and weak points of
n−point statistics, and how network representations of
galaxy distributions can improve our ability to quantify
topological features in the Universe. In §3, we describe
our samples to be investigated, the snapshot of Illustris
data (Vogelsberger et al. 2014A) and L´evy walks with
various parameters. In §4, we present the two-point cor-
relation functions and network measurements from the
samples and discuss the results. Then, we summarize in
§5.

2. GEOMETRIC CONFIGURATIONS VS. TOPOLOGICAL

TEXTURES IN GALAXY SURVEYS

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 present the deﬁnitions of geometry
and topology used in this paper and our overall philoso-
phy in applying methods of network analyses to galaxy
distributions. Readers can skip these sections without
losing the main thread of this paper.

2.1. Geometry vs. Topology

The terms geometry and topoplogy are often used in-
terchangeably in astronomical contexts. Geometry can
be deﬁned as the study of shapes of known metric di-
mensions, whereas topology refers to the intrinsic shape
properties that are invariant to deformation (i.e., ho-
motopic). For example, triangles are 3-sided geometric
shapes that are characterized by the measures of their
angles and sides. However, removing all metric features
from triangles, we can also represent them topologically
as a metric-free structure with three vertices where each
vertext is connected to the other two by two edges. An-
other well-known example is the comparison between a
mug and a donut; these are diﬀerent geometric shapes
with a common topology, the latter measured by a zero
genus number.

Euler characteristics in graphs or genus numbers in
manifolds are mathematically well-deﬁned topological
measures, invariant under homotopy or homeomorphism.
However, most practical measurements are both geomet-
ric and topological, and do not have to be homotopy

invariant in the strict mathematical sense in order to be
topologically meaningful. For example, the set of Roman
alphabets is topological. We can consistently recognize
letters irrespective of font or handwriting since each al-
phabet has its own distinct topology. “i”, “k”, “l” are
topologically very diﬀerent even in mathematically rigor-
ous measures. However, “i” and “j” are indistinct topo-
logically. They are discerned instead by the diﬀerences in
length and curve (angle). The process of reading, i.e., vi-
sually measuring the characteristics of each letter, is pre-
dominantly topological but includes geometric aspects.

In galaxy surveys, n−point statistics are typical mea-
surements, as presented in §1. These are geometri-
cally driven measurements; n−point correlation func-
tions contain speciﬁc information about distances and
angles between galaxies. From a practical standpoint,
this renders n−point statistics computationally challeng-
ing, since computation times are dominated by the han-
dling of geometric information.

If we are only interested in topological features, much
of the geometric information is redundant. For example,
if we need to count all triangles in a friends-of-friends
network from a certain galaxy distribution, we can run
a network algorithm to count all triangular subgraphs.
We do not need to measure the three point statistic for
the problem of only counting triangles. Likewise, if we
are interested in the number of holes for an object, we do
not need to know whether it looks like a mug or a donut.
Therefore, in practical analyses, we need to determine
whether we are interested in quantifying geometric con-
ﬁgurations or topological textures, when extracting mea-
surements from galaxy survey data. Theoretically, a
complete set of n−point statistics can suﬃce to charac-
terize all aspects of a point distribution. However, such
geometric analyses can be very ineﬃcient when our prime
focus is to quantify topological textures of the Universe.

2.2. Continuous Density Function vs. Discrete Point

Distribution

To quantify topological structures of the Universe,
many conventional studies have used geometric topol-
ogy, where a metric topology is well-deﬁned in a con-
tinuous cosmic matter distribution, ρ(x), or its density
contrast, δ(x).
In this approach, discrete observables
such as galaxy or halo distributions, n(x), are considered
as biased samplings of the underlying continuous cosmic
matter distribution. Therefore, we generally smooth this
discrete point distribution to approximate the continuous
mass ﬁeld.

In a diﬀerent and empirical approach, we do not
smooth over the discrete observable, n(x). Instead, we
build a network structure (or, a graph) from this dis-
crete observable, and measure network quantities; hence,
algebraic topology from discrete observables, contrast to
the previous approach of metric topology from contin-
uous observables. Hereafter, we refer to the former as
“DA” (discrete and algebraic) approach, and the latter
as “CM” (continuous and metric) approach.

The CM and DA approaches diﬀer in methodology.
The CM approach is based on diﬀerential geometry and
topology; hence, parameters of geometric shape and
topology are derived from diﬀerentials or integrals of the
density ﬁeld. For example, the Hessian matrix is derived
from partial diﬀerentials of the density ﬁeld. From the

Network Topology

3

eigenvalues of this matrix, the clusters, walls, and ﬁla-
ments of the density ﬁeld are classiﬁed (Arag´on-Calvo
et al. 2007, Bond et al. 2010, Cautun et al. 2013).
Minkowski functionals are deﬁned using integrals of the
density ﬁeld to quantify geometric and topological fea-
tures such as area, perimeter, and genus (Mecke et al.
1994, Park et al. 2005, Hikage et al. 2008, Ducout et al.
2013).

On the other hand, our DA approach (which we refer
to as “network cosmology”) mostly utilizes network al-
gorithms developed and used in computer science, math-
ematics, physics, and sociology. With its roots in Eu-
ler’s brilliant solution to the K¨onigsburg bridge problem
(Euler 1741), network science has grown rapidly during
the last two decades, driven by the growth of comput-
ing power, large databases, and internet infrastructures
(Albert & Barab´asi 2002, Barab´asi 2009, Newman 2010).
Networks can be constructed for studying subjects as di-
verse as the relationships between costarring actors, pro-
tein interactions, paper citations, the food web, power
grids, traﬃc patterns, the world wide web (WWW), etc.
Many network tools have been developed to extract use-
ful information from these various kinds of big data net-
works. We have attempted, therefore, to utilize these
network tools for investigating galaxy survey data. For
example, PageRank was developed for prioritizing the
importance of WWW documents, used in the search en-
gine, Google8 (Page et al. 1999). We can measure these
PageRank s for galaxies, once we build a galaxy network
from galaxy survey data. As we have a friend recom-
mendation from Facebook 9, such a recommendation al-
gorithm also can be applied to our galaxy network. This
is the basic philosophy of our network cosmology.

Early attempts of applying network science tools to
galaxy point distributions made use of percolation meth-
ods and the minimum spanning tree, or MST (see, e.g,
Shandarin et al. 1983AB, Barrow et al. 1985, Colberg
2007). Since these pioneering papers, the tools developed
for analyzing networks have proliferated and mathemat-
ically matured. Our earlier work, HD15, investigated
galaxy distributions using various measures of network
centrality (degree, betweenness, and closeness). In this
paper, we apply the network measures of diameter, giant
component fraction, and transitivity to simulated galaxy
point distributions.

2.3. Degeneracy in Two-point Correlation Function

It has long been reported that observed galaxy popula-
tions exhibit single power-law clusterings within several
tens of megaparsecs in comoving scale (e.g., Davis & Pee-
bles 1983, Shandarin & Zeldovich 1989, Adelberger et al.
2005). Within the cold dark matter paradigm of galaxy
formation, galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying
matter distribution and the clustering properties of dif-
ferent galaxy populations can be diverse, depending on
how galaxies populate their dark matter halos. Analysis
of the two-point correlation function of diﬀerent galaxy
populations has resulted in the idea of the “halo occupa-
tion distribution”; i.e., the probability that a given halo
contains a certain number of galaxies, and has given rise
to various analytic and probabilistic formulations of this

8 http://www.google.com
9 http://www.facebook.com

function (Berlind & Weinberg 2002, Zheng et al. 2005,
Tinker 2007). From these halo occupation studies, there
should be a transitioning scale from the dominance of
the one halo term to the two halo term; hence there is
no need for galaxies to show a single, seamless power-law
clustering trend. The apparent single power-law behav-
ior, especially for low redshift galaxies, is thought to be
due to massive galaxy clusters whose contribution erases
the transition feature (Berlind & Weinberg 2002).

For a single power-law correlation, a couple of methods
have been proposed to generate mock galaxies including
L´evy walks (Mandelbrot 1975) and multi-layered shells
akin to Russian dolls or onion rings (Soneira & Peebles
1978; hereafter, SP78). These models are “statistical”,
since, unlike galaxies in simulations or the real Universe,
their clustering properties do not originate from “gravita-
tional” interaction, but instead from a statistical fractal
realization. These models can be tuned to match both
the abundance and the two-point correlation function of
the observed galaxy distribution.

Now, we raise two questions:
(1) What is the gap between gravitational and statis-

tical realizations?, and

(2) Can we quantify the gap to ﬁnally test how much

statistical models are reliable as mocks?

These are based on doubts about the suﬃciency of in-
formation from abundance and two-point statistics for
testing cosmologies and features that are missing in two-
point statistics.

Interestingly, it is trivial for the human eye to cap-
ture the gap between statistical models and observed
(or simulated) galaxy distributions. SP78 reproduced
a reasonable ﬁrst approximation of the observed galaxy
distribution using their fractal model to match the ob-
served single power-law clustering. And, due to some
visual gap in spatial distributions between their models
and observed galaxies, they remarked on the ability of
the human eye, inherently optimized to detect topologi-
cal patterns rather than mathematical geometries. SP78
note that patterns easily discriminated by the human eye
are diﬃcult to quantify, when compared to mathemati-
cally straightforward n−point statistics. Overall, SP78
implied that there are some features, easily captured by
the human eye, that are not easily quantiﬁed by n−point
statistics.

In this paper, we show that statistical ensembles pro-
duced by L´evy walks do not resemble simulated galaxies
upon visual inspection (§3), agreeing with the same qual-
itative conclusion of SP78. However, to make a new step
forward, we propose that topologically motivated diag-
nostics, especially the network measurements adopted in
what follows, can quantify such eye-capturing features.

To test our proposal, we employ a simple setup, as
follows. First, we adopt simulated galaxies as a cosmo-
logical sample. While there are discrepancies between
observed and simulated galaxies, cosmological hydrody-
namic simulation can provide accurate three-dimensional
positions with realistic galactic properties, appropriate as
a simple pilot study without any observational compli-
cation. Second, we generate a statistical ensemble, using
L´evy walks, to match the two-point correlation function
of the simulated galaxies. The next section, §3, will cover
these two steps and present the spatial distributions of
the simulated and statistical models to show any visual

4

Hong et al.

gap between them. Finally, we measure network quan-
tities for the simulated sample and statistical ensemble
in §4. These network measurements will explain why
we recognize a diﬀerence between statistical and gravi-
tational realizations by sight, while they have practically
the same clustering property. This will lead us to discuss
the limitations of n−point statistics and the potential of
network measurements as complementary topological di-
agnostics.

3. GALAXY DISTRIBUTIONS WITH SINGLE POWER-LAW

CLUSTERING

In this section, we describe the two sets of simulated
galaxy distributions, one resulting from a hydrodynamic
cosmological simulation and the other a fractal generated
by a simple L´evy walk.

3.1. Simulated Galaxies : Illustris Data

The Illustris cosmological simulation is a modern, pub-
licly available simulation that computes the formation
and evolution of both dark matter and baryonic struc-
tures (Vogelsberger et al. 2014AB, Genel et al. 2014,
Nelson et al. 2015). Illustris was performed using sim-
ple models for the complex physics of star formation and
growth of supermassive black holes and associated feed-
back processes (Springel & Hernquist 2003; Springel et
al. 2005; Di Matteo et al. 2005; Sijacki et al. 2007; Vo-
gelsberger et al. 2013). Illustris was run with the moving
mesh code Arepo (Springel 2010), an approach that oﬀers
advantages in ﬂexibility and accuracy compared to other
methods commonly used in cosmology (e.g. Vogelsberger
et al. 2012, Keres et al. 2012, Sijacki et al. 2012, Nelson
et al. 2013, Zhu et al. 2015). It yields one of the best
simulated representations of galaxy morphologies created
within the context of a simulation, and hence provides
a reasonable dataset to mimic the properties of galaxies
resulting from an observational survey.

Speciﬁcally, we chose a single snapshot (# 100) from
Its corresponding redshift is
the Illustris simulation.
0.58, by which time non-linear structures are well-
developed; hence we observe rich topological structures.
The size of the simulation box is 75 h−1Mpc in comoving
coordinates. The resolution of the dark matter mass is
6.26 × 106 M⊙ and the resolution of the baryonic mass
1.26 × 106 M⊙. We selected galaxies with stellar mass
≥ 108M⊙; this yields a sample of 75,050 galaxies. Here-
after, we refer to this sample as “Snap100”.

The top-left panel of Figure 1 shows the two-
dimensional spatial distribution of Snap100, projected
along the z-axis. We can identify rich structures of clus-
ters and ﬁlaments. The red-open diamonds in the top-
right panel of Figure 1 show the two point correlation
function of Snap100, measured using the method from
Landy & Szalay (1993). We do not apply integral con-
straints to any of the samples in this paper, since they
are minor and contribute the same amount due to the
equal survey volume. Power-law slopes can be slightly
shallower, when integral constraints are applied. The
clustering of galaxies in Snap100 is well represented by a
single power-law with the slope, γ ∼ 1.5.

3.2. Statistical Fractal Galaxies : L´evy Walks

A L´evy walk (or a L´evy ﬂight) is a random walk, whose

step-size l follows the distribution

P (> l) = (cid:26) (l0/l)α for l ≥ l0

for l < l0,

1

(1)

where l0 is a minimum step-size and α is a fractal di-
mension. The L´evy walk was introduced by Mandelbrot
(1975) in cosmology as a method for generating a fractal
galaxy distribution. The two-point correlation function
of a L´evy walk follows a power law

ξ(r) = C(l0, α) r−γ,

(2)

where γ = 3 − α and C(l0, α) is a constant determined
by l0 and α .

3.2.1. Periodic Boundary Condition: L´evy Walk in a Box

The typical L´evy walk presented above is an unbound
random walk. To compare a L´evy walk with the cos-
mological simulation, we need to conﬁne the walks to a
cubic box. Hence, we apply a periodic boundary condi-
tion; we refer to this new L´evy walk as “L´evy Walk in
a Box” (LWIB). The periodic boundary condition does
not change the slope of two point correlation function,
γ = 3 − α, but aﬀects the clustering amplitude, C,

ξ(r) = C(l0, α, Ng, L) r−γ,

(3)

where Ng is the total number of L´evy walks and L is
the size of the box. The newly entered walks result-
ing from the periodic boundary condition contribute as
random encounters to the previously occupied walks.
Hence, when increasing Ng, the clustering amplitude,
C(l0, α, Ng, L), decreases in LWIB models. We set Ng =
75, 050 and L = 75 h−1Mpc to compare LWIB with
Snap100.

3.2.2. Proximity Adjustment: Tweaking Small-Scale

Clustering

Although L´evy walks are an elegant way to pro-
duce galaxies following a single power-law clustering, the
caveat is that their power-law clustering property is only
valid for r > l0. All galaxy pairs closer than this mini-
mum length are random encounters resulting in ﬂat clus-
tering for r ≤ l0. The middle panels of Figure 1 show
the spatial distributions of two LWIB models, LWIBa
and LWIBb; their model parameters are summarized in
Table 1. The top-right panel shows the two-point cor-
relation functions of these two models, LWIBa (black)
and LWIBb (grey). The vertical dashed lines represent
the minimum step sizes: l0 = 0.2 (grey) and l0 = 0.24
(black). The two LWIB models match well the two point
correlation function of Snap100 for r > l0. However,
for r ≤ l0, the clustering ﬂatten out due to their intrinsic
limitations, as noted above. To extend the power-law be-
havior to the smaller scales r ≤ l0, we need to make those
random close pairs geometrically more compact. We re-
fer to this small-scale tuning of clustering as “Proximity
Adjustment” (PA).

There are many empirical approaches for determining
the proximity correction. Our method is to require: (1)
the correction to be based on the LWIB, and identical to
the latter in the limit of zero correction; and (2) that the
corrections only be applied on small scales r ≤ l0. We

refer to the models satisfying these two criteria as “L´evy
Walks in a Box with Proximity Adjustment” (LWIBPA).
Speciﬁcally, we choose a simple extension of LWIB for
our LWIBPA model, as follows. First, from the initial
position (or the current position), we generate the next
walk by LWIB with (l0, α). Second, we ﬁnd the nearest
neighbor from the new walk position. Third, if the dis-
tance from the nearest neighbor rmin is larger than the
minimum step size l0, i.e., rmin > l0, then we accept this
walk and proceed to the next iteration.
If rmin ≤ l0,
we calculate a new step size from the new power-law of
(lm, β), where lm < l0.
If this new step size, rnew, is
larger than l0, i.e., rnew > l0, then we discard this PA
process to accept the original LWIB position and proceed
to the next iteration. If rnew ≤ l0, we take a random roll,
µ ∈ [0, 1). If this roll, µ, is larger than our acceptance
threshold, pθ, i.e., µ > pθ, we again discard this PA pro-
cess to accept the original LWIB position and proceed
to the next iteration. Finally, for µ ≤ pθ along with the
previous rmin ≤ l0 and rnew ≤ l0, we accept this PA
correction. We keep the direction between the nearest
neighbor and new walk position to only replace rmin with
rnew. Whether the PA correction is accepted or not, the
next walk is calculated based on the original LWIB posi-
tion. We build this PA recipe in a conservative manner
to keep the new LWIBPA as close as possible to the orig-
inal LWIB. To brieﬂy summarize, our LWIBPA model
is a broken two-power-law model with a threshold of ac-
ceptance probability determining the choice between the
two power laws, and is represented by the ﬁve parameters
(l0, α, lm, β, pθ).

The bottom-panels of Figure 1 show the spatial dis-
tributions of our two LWIBPA models, LWIBPAa and
LWIBPAb, where their parameters are summarized in
Table 1. The top-right panel shows the two point cor-
relation functions of LWIBPAa (green) and LWIBPAb
(blue). These two models are variants of the origi-
nal LWIBa model, sharing the same parameters (l0 =
0.24, α = 1.5); but having diﬀerent acceptance probabil-
ities, pθ = 0.35 for LWIBPAa and pθ = 1 for LWIBPAb.
LWIBa also corresponds to the model of pθ = 0.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Missing Topologies in Two Point Correlation

Function

In the previous section, we described our adopted sim-
ulation sets, Snap100, and L´evy walk recipes, and mea-
sured their two-point correlation functions, as summa-
rized in Figure 1.

LWIBPAa yields a good match to the correlation func-

tion of Snap100, at least to the accuracy of practical
clustering studies. LWIBa and LWIBPAb can be con-
sidered, respectively, as “lower” and “upper” bounds of
correlation functions encompassing suppressed and en-
hanced small scale clustering. LWIBb is a model with
slightly diﬀerent parameters, l0 = 0.2 and α = 1.6, from
LWIBa, demonstrating that the clustering properties of
LWIB models do not change abruptly by choosing pa-
rameters nearby. Hence, the four types of L´evy walk
models illustrated in Figure 1 span a good range of pos-
sible L´evy fractals, comparable to Snap100.

The important point is that while the L´evy walk dis-
tributions reproduce the two-point correlation function
of the galaxy distribution in the Illustris simulation,
none of them mimic the actual spatial distribution of
the Snap100 galaxies. In particular, the L´evy walks fail
to reproduce the ﬁlamentary structure that is so charac-
teristic of actual galaxy distributions. This implies that
L´evy fractals are not appropriate for explaining the struc-
ture of the (simulated) Universe, and two-point statistics
are highly degenerate. As noted in §2, this is because
topological features are elusive in n-point statistics, while
human eyes are more adapted to eﬀectively recognize
topologies of patterns and connectivities. Unlike what
has been believed up to now, that such eye capturing
features are hard to quantify, in the following sections
we describe how such topologies can be measured using
network science tools.

4.2. Network Analysis: Quantifying Missing Topologies

A network is a data structure composed of “vertices”
(or nodes) connected by “edges” (or links); also known as
a graph in mathematics. In the 21st century, network sci-
ence (or graph theory) has becomes one of the most crit-
ical tools in various ﬁelds, such as bioinformatics, com-
puter science, physics, and sociology. In a previous work
(HD15), we explored the use of network measures (be-
tweenness, closeness and degree) to investigate the rela-
tionships between galaxy properties and topology. The
results were promising, but limited by the use of pho-
tometric (rather than spectroscopic) redshifts to char-
acterize the 3-dimensional galaxy distribution. Readers
interested in networks are referred to Newman (2003),
Dorogovtsev & Goltsev (2008), Barth´elemy (2011), and
HD15 for further information.

4.2.1. Linking Length and Friends-of-friends Network

To build a network from a given galaxy population, we
adopt the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) recipe
(e.g. Huchra & Geller 1984, More et al. 2011, HD15).

For a given linking length l, we deﬁne the adjacency

matrix as,

Aij = (cid:26) 1 if rij ≤ l,

0 otherwise,

(4)

where rij is the distance between the two vertices, i and
j. This binary matrix quantitatively represents the net-
work connectivities of the FOF recipe. Many important
network measures are derived from this matrix.

4.2.2. Network Topologies : Diameter, Giant Component,

and Transitivity

We measure three simple scalar quantities, diameter,
giant component, and transitivity, from FOF networks

Figure 1. The top-left panel shows the spatial distribution of the Illustris galaxy distribution at z = 0.58 (“Snap100”) in comoving
coordinates and the middle and bottom panels show L´evy walk galaxies with various parameters, summarized in Table 1. The top-right
panel shows the two point correlation function for each sample. The dashed vertical lines represent the minimum step sizes of L´evy Walk
models. We produce 100 realizations for each L´evy walk and, here, we present 5 measurements (hence, 5 lines for each) to illustrate
ensemble variances. The major diﬀerence, even clear in visual inspection, between the cosmological simulation and L´evy fractals is the
ﬁlamentary structure, which is absent in the L´evy fractal realizations.

Figure 2. The three network measurements, giant component
fraction (top), diameter (middle), and transitivity (bottom) vs.
linking length for the ﬁve models, the Illustris z = 0.58 snapshot
(“Snap100”) (red-open diamonds), LWIBa (black lines), LWIBb
(grey lines), LWIBPAa (green lines), and LWIBPAb (blue lines).
For each L´evy walk model, we plot 5 lines for 5 realizations like in
Figure 1 to illustrate statistical variances. All the three network
measurements show clear separations between Snap100 and L´evy
fractals, implying that L´evy walk models fail to match the topolog-
ical properties of Snap100. The galaxy distribution in the Illustris
simulation is clearly not a L´evy fractal.

for various linking lengths, using the open network li-
brary, igraph (Csardi & Nepusz 2006). Due to their
simple deﬁnitions, these measures are computationally
cheap and widely used in complex networks. The ques-
tion is whether these network science tools can quantify
the topological diﬀerences missed by two point statistics.

The Diameter is the largest path length of shortest-
pathways from all pairs in a network. The path length
is deﬁned as the number of steps to reach from a certain
vertex, i, to another, j. Hence, the pathways of min-
imum path length are the shortest pathways between
the vertices, i and j; generally, there can be multiple
shortest pathways between a pair in an unweighted net-
work. When a linking length is quite small to isolate all
galaxies alone, the diameter is trivially 0. As the link-
ing length is increased, the diameter grows to reach a
certain maximum value. Since, for a very large linking
length, all pairs are connected by a single direct edge (in
the mathematical terms, forming a “complete graph”),
the diameter asymptotically decreases to 1, after reach-
ing the maximum value. Hence, this varying curve of
Diameter vs. Linking Length is a quantiﬁed topology,
depending on pathway structures.

The Giant component is the largest connected sub-
graph in a network. As in the case of diameter, gi-
ant components are trivial for the two extreme linking
lengths. For a small linking length that isolates individ-
ual galaxies, the size of the giant component is 1.
In
the opposite case of a very large linking length forming
a complete graph, the giant component size is equal to
the total number of vertices (galaxies). Hence, the ratio
of the size of the giant component to the total number of
vertices is a fraction that increases from 0 to 1 monoton-
ically with the linking length. The rate of growth of this
ratio depends on topology; if a network has some topo-
logical structures to connect vertices more eﬃciently, the
fraction of the giant component grows faster to reach 1
at a smaller linking length.

Transitivity can be described as a “triangle density”

for a network. It is deﬁned as:

C =

number of closed paths of length two

number of paths of length two

,

(5)

where C denotes the transitivity (Newman 2010). A path
of length two means a “∨” shaped connection; i.e. my
friend-of-friend conﬁguration in a social network. If my
friend-of-friend is my direct friend, this path of length
two forms a closed path of length two; i.e. a triangle
“▽”. Therefore, Equation 5 predicts a higher transitiv-
ity value if there are more triangles in a network. To
some extent, transitivity can be considered as a minimal
(and topological) version of the three point correlation
function.

Figure 2 shows the three network quantities for our 5
samples, Snap100 (red-open diamonds), LWIBa (black
lines), LWIBb (grey lines), LWIBPAa (green lines), and
LWIBPAb (blue lines). As in Figure 1, for each L´evy
walk model we plot 5 lines for 5 realizations to illustrate
statistical variance. The three network quantities are
uniquely determined for a given linking length. Namely,
the three plots of diameter, giant component, and transi-
tivity vs. linking length are self-consistently determined
for a given spatial distribution like n−point statistics
without any further parameter or assumption, except for
their independent variable, linking length.

The top panel of Figure 2 shows the results for gi-
ant component fractions. Now we can quantitatively
discern Snap100 (red-open diamonds) from LWIBPAa
(green lines), though they have (practically) the same

component (red line), visualizing the spatial network structure of the giant component. The linking length is 1.1 h−1Mpc, where the
diameter is maximized. The texture of this Snap100 giant component can be described as “thin, diversifying, and ﬁlamentary”.

abundance and two-point correlation function, shown in
Figure 1. All the other L´evy walk models also fail to
match the growth curve of giant component fractions.
When considering that LWIBa and LWIBPAb are, re-
spectively,
lower and upper bounds of the small-scale
clustering for LWIBPAa (and Snap100), the failures of
all L´evy walk models to match giant component frac-
tions imply the fundamental diﬀerence in the pathway
topology between Snap100 and L´evy fractals; Snap100
has more eﬃcient pathways to connect all galaxies at a
shorter linking length than L´evy fractals. Very likely, this
is due to the ﬁlamentary structures in Snap100, lacking
in L´evy fractals.

The middle panel of Figure 2 shows the diameters. We
can again see clear separations of Snap100 from the L´evy
walk models. Snap100 reaches the maximum diameter,
300, at the linking length, 1.1h−1Mpc, while L´evy walk
models reach the maximum diameters around 200 for
linking lengths near 2.0h−1Mpc. Even for 100 L´evy walk

realizations, none of the L´evy walk models can match the
diameter measurements of Snap100. Hence, both the size
of the giant component and diameter are network mea-
sures that discriminate the L´evy walk topologies from
the Illustris simulation, despite the data sets being con-
structed to have matching abundance and two-point cor-
relation statistics.

The linking length for maximum diameter is related to
the inﬂection point of the growth curve of giant compo-
nent fractions; the rate of growth of the giant component
decreases after reaching the maximum diameter. This
transitioning feature occurs due to the “saturation” of
connecting edges. At ﬁrst (i.e., small linking length val-
ues), increasing the linking length results in adding new
vertices and increasing the size of the connected net-
work components. However, once the largest diameter
is reached, increasing the linking length tends to form
new pathways within the existing structure between more
far-ﬂung members and only slowly increases the overall

Figure 4. The same as Figure 3 but for LWIBPAa. The linking length is 2.0 h−1Mpc, where the diameter for LWIBPAa is maximized.
The texture of LWIBPAa’s giant component (red lines) can be described as “thick, clumpy, and modularized”. The blue lines show the
edges of the giant component (hence, the largest component), and the green lines of the second, third, and fourth largest components, for
the linking length 1.1 h−1Mpc, comparable to Figure 3. While the giant component of Snap100 shows a fully developed global structure
at 1.1 h−1Mpc, the giant component (blue lines) and next largest components (green lines) of LWIBPAa are still localized due to the lack
of topological bridges.

size of the connected structure. Therefore, the diame-
ter is maximized at this critical scale, transitioning from
“growing phase” to “saturating phase”. The previous
percolation studies are closely related to this maximum
diameter scale, though they have not measured these spe-
ciﬁc diameters. If the system size is inﬁnite, the diame-
ter measurements transit from ﬁnite values to an inﬁnity
near this scale.

The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows transitivity re-
sults. Again, none of L´evy walk models mimic the transi-
tivity curve of Snap100. We note that the statistical vari-
ances of transitivity measurements are much smaller than
the other measurements as shown in Figure 2, since a sin-
gle realization of the network is statistically large enough
for counting triangles. Hence, the diﬀerence of transitiv-
ities between Snap100 and L´evy fractals also suggests
that Snap100 is topologically very diﬀerent from L´evy

fractals.

An interesting feature is the diﬀerence of convexities
between Snap100 (concave or “cup”) and L´evy fractals
(convex or “hat”). The transitivities of Snap100 are high
for small linking lengths, then decrease to a minimum
transitivity at 0.4 h−1Mpc as the linking length increases.
After this, the transitivities slowly increase to 0.8. This
transitivity trend of Snap100 is related to the transition
between the one-halo term to the two-halo term in halo
occupation clustering models (Berlind & Weinberg 2002).
For small linking lengths, most triangles form in clus-
ter environments reﬂecting halo substructures. Hence,
these “intra-halo triangles” (i.e., triangles lying within
one halo) dominate the transitivities for small linking
lengths, and result in a decreasing trend from a very
high transitivity. On the other hand, for suﬃciently
large linking lengths, “inter-halo triangles” (i.e., halo-

10

Hong et al.

halo-halo triangles) dominate over intra-halo triangles,
simply because their conﬁgurations are more frequently
found. Since a “∨” shaped conﬁguration becomes a trian-
gle for a larger increased linking length, the transitivities
for inter-halo scales are generally an increasing function.
Therefore, this is potentially a very interesting point.

For L´evy walk models, the origins of triangles are dif-
ferent from Snap100. For scales smaller than the mini-
mum L´evy walk step l0 (0.2 h−1Mpc and 0.24 h−1Mpc in
Table 1), the triangles originate from “random” encoun-
ters or our “proximity adjustment” recipe. For scales
larger than the minimum L´evy walk steps, the fractal
L´evy walks shape the rest of the triangles. Hence, dis-
continuities occur at these breaking scales in transitivity
curves. The typical fractal transitivities increase to reach
maximum values, and then asymptotically decrease to
around 0.75. These convex (or “hat”) trends contrast to
the concave (or “cup”) shape of Snap100.

Figure 3 shows the edges (red lines) connecting galax-
ies in the giant component of Snap100, visualizing the
spatial network structure of the giant component. The
linking length is 1.1h−1Mpc, where the diameter is max-
imized. The texture of this Snap100 giant component
can be described as “thin, diversifying, and ﬁlamentary”.
Figure 4 shows the same as Figure 3 for LWIBPAa. The
linking length is 2.0 h−1Mpc, where the diameter for
LWIBPAa is maximized. The texture of LWIBPAa’s gi-
ant component (red lines) can be described as “thick,
clumpy, and modularized”. The blue lines show the edges
of giant component for the linking length 1.1 h−1Mpc,
comparable to Figure 3. While the giant component of
Snap100 shows a fully developed global structure at 1.1
h−1Mpc, the giant component of LWIBPAa (blue lines)
is still localized due to the lack of topological bridges.
Overall, the structural and topological diﬀerences be-
tween Snap100 and L´evy fractals are well reﬂected in
network structure.

Figure 5 presents two basic schemas to demonstrate
which topological conﬁguration can increase (or de-
crease) the transitivity. We note that variation of tran-
sitivity depends on very complex topological structures.
The schemas are only two possible cases among many.

The top diagram of Figure 5 shows that the new ver-
tex (asterisk) and edges (grey dashed lines) produce four
additional “∨” conﬁgurations, but none of them form a
triangle; hence, transitivity decreases by this new vertex.
This schema provides a possible illustration as to why
Snap100 shows a decreasing transitivity trend at intra-
halo scales. On the other hand, the bottom diagram of
Figure 5 shows that the new vertex and edges form three
additional triangles to increase the transitivity. Basi-
cally a linear chain of walks is less eﬃcient in forming
triangles than a gravitational pull to pack galaxies. This
explains why L´evy walks show smaller transitivities at
small scales than Snap100. However, such low transitiv-
ity values can be restored as the linking length increases
as in the bottom diagram. Hence, the diﬀerent behaviors
of transitivity between Snap100 and L´evy fractals reﬂect
the diﬀerent topological bindings of galaxies (or walks);
i.e., gravitationally packed solid ball vs. linearly tangled
ball.

Decreasing Transitivity

*

Increasing Transitivity

***********

Figure 5. Schemas demonstrating two possible cases to increase
(top) and to decrease (bottom) transitivity values by adding a new
vertex (asterisk) and its edges (dashed-grey lines). In the top di-
agram, the new dashed edge produces 4 additional “∨” conﬁgu-
rations, but none of them form triangles. On the other hand, in
the bottom diagram, three triangles form by the new vertex and
edges. Hence, the diﬀerent convexities of transitivity curves for
Snap100 and L´evy fractals reﬂect the intrinsic diﬀerence of topo-
logical structures.

In this paper we have used a network approach to com-
pare two galaxy distributions with similar two-point cor-
relation statistics but diﬀerent topologies, one derived
from a cosmological simulation and the other from a L´evy
walk. The network measures are computed directly from
the point distribution of the galaxies, unlike past mea-
sures that characterize a smoothed continuous version of
the point distribution. We ﬁnd that the simulated galax-
ies and L´evy walks are statistically diﬀerent in diameter,
giant component, and transitivity measurements, which
shows that L´evy walks fail to mimic the topologies of the
distribution of the simulated galaxies, though they suc-
cessfully match the abundance and two point correlation
function.

This implies that quantiﬁed topologies are important
for testing cosmologies. While n-point statistics are un-
deniably useful diagnostics, their topological complemen-
taries are necessary to properly test cosmologies and to
prevent misinterpretation that could result from over-
simpliﬁed false-positive models.
