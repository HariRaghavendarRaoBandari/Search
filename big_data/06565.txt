Density functionals with the help of MPS

1. Introduction

The formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of density functionals instead of wave
functions, following the ground-breaking works of Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham [1,
2], made numerical simulations of quantum mechanical systems ranging from the
microscopic to the macroscopic world feasible [3, 4, 5]. The usefulness of density
functional theory (DFT) is certiﬁed by the number of works based on the original
publications [1, 2] and on later improvements of the exchange-correlation (xc) energy
density functional Exc [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

DFT in its most widely used form, namely Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT [2], requires
the xc density functional in order to be able to compute ground state energies and
densities. By virtue of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1], all ground state observables are
functionals of the ground state density n, and so Exc = Exc[n]. The ground state energy
E = E[n] of a system can be decomposed into a kinetic, an interaction and a potential
part. By means of a ﬁctitious non-interacting system, namely the KS system, the non-
interacting part of the kinetic energy, T s = T s[n], can be obtained eﬃciently, which
represents a large contribution to the full interacting kinetic energy T . Further, part
of the interaction energy is accounted for by the Hartree energy EH[n]. The potential
part EV [n] can be exactly computed eﬃciently for any ground state density n. Finally,
the remaining part of the total ground state energy deﬁnes the xc density functional,
Exc[n] := E[n] − T s[n] − EH[n] − EV[n]. DFT is in principle exact, but in practice
determining the precise form of the xc density functional is QMA-hard [13]. Therefore,
KS DFT can only make use of approximations of Exc. The enormous success of DFT is
thus deeply connected to the successful construction of good approximations for the xc
energy density functional.

In the history of DFT and quest for a universally applicable approximate Exc [14],
mainly two diﬀerent paths have been followed: one is the non-empirical approach
pioneered by Perdew [15] and the other is the semi-empirical approach initiated by
Becke [8]. The non-empirical approach makes use of exact conditions, that a physical
system must fulﬁll, to ﬁnd approximations for the xc density functional. Within this
approach a “Jacob’s ladder” of functionals was built where each functional on a higher
rung of the ladder is supposed to improve upon the ones on the lower rungs [16, 17].
On the lowest rung of the “Jacob’s ladder” resides the local density approximation
(LDA), which was already introduced by Kohn and Sham in [2]. The higher rungs are
supposed to systematically improve upon the LDA, which, in practice, does not always
happen [17]. Additionally, at the moment, the more precise functionals on the higher
rungs are so much more diﬃcult to compute that further improvements of DFT following
this non-empirical approach seem very hard to achieve. In the semi-empirical approach,
an ansatz for the functional form of Exc is ﬁtted using experimental data, accurate
theoretical reference data, or other constraints. However, often relatively small training
sets are used in these ﬁts and then the resulting functionals can be biased towards their
training [14].

Alternatively, we might obtain further improvements of Exc away from but using
concepts of both the semi-empirical and the non-empirical approach, e.g. by using a
large set of accurate training densities and corresponding values of Exc, and by ﬁtting
an eﬃcient ansatz to these data that includes some exact conditions. Obviously, a
diﬃculty of this alternative scheme is that it requires a possibly large number of
accurate solutions for the quantum many-body problem. However, nowadays, tensor
network states provide precise results for quantum many-body systems, e.g. [18, 19], in
particular with respect to ground state properties. In this article, we want to analyze
the feasibility of constructing an approximate xc density functional of a speciﬁc form,
when large training sets of ground state densities and corresponding values of Exc are
available. The speciﬁc form for the ansatz of our approximation is inspired by the non-
empirical approach [17]: it includes the LDA [2, 20] and allows a systematic improvement
beyond it. For this feasibility study, we focus on discrete lattice problems and the one-
dimensional case, and we use matrix product states (MPS) for the computation of
accurate ground state energies and densities [21, 22].

The structure of this article is as follows. In section 2 we introduce the considered
Hamiltonian and observables. The corresponding exact LDA is presented in section 3.
We then propose, ﬁt, and assess our ansatz in section 4. Finally, in section 5 we conclude
this work and give an outlook.

2. Model

In the following, we consider two species of fermions with long-ranged soft-Coulomb
interaction on a ﬁnite one-dimensional lattice of length L with hard-wall boundary
conditions, as represented by the Hamiltonian:

ˆH := ˆT + ˆW + ˆV

ˆnl,σ := c†
l,σcl,σ is the corresponding occupation number operator and ˆnl := ˆnl,↑ + ˆnl,↓.
The total particle number is denoted by N := hPL
l=1 ˆnli. We obtain ground states with
diﬀerent total particle number by choosing diﬀerent values for the chemical potential
µ, which plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier ﬁxing N. Such a Hamiltonian can
also describe the discretized continuous problem with lattice spacing ∆ when in (2a)

Density functionals with the help of MPS

t is replaced by 1/(2∆2) and in (2b) the denominator p(m − l)2 + 1 is replaced by
p(m − l)2∆2 + 1. The solution for diﬀerent discretizations can be very precisely
computed with MPS [23, 24] and so our approach should yield highly accurate training
densities. Here we see (1) as the Hamiltonian of the problem, and not a discrete version
of a more fundamental one, thus we set t = 1/2 and U = 1 and ﬁx the number of lattice
sites to L = 21 from now on.

On a ﬁnite lattice, densities nl := hˆnli = hˆnl,↑ + ˆnl,↓i can be written into a vector
n := (n1, n2, . . . , nL)T - where T denotes the transpose - such that every density
functional F can be written as a function of such density vectors F = F (n).
In
the following, we will consider the universal Hohenberg-Kohn functional FHK(n), the
Hartree-energy EH(n), and the non-interacting kinetic energy T s(n), e.g. [20]. For the
above Hamiltonian (1) these functionals read:

i.e.
corresponding to (1) with ˆW , and E s(n) denotes the ground state energy of a non-
interacting density n, i.e. corresponding to (1) without ˆW . Knowing the values of these
functionals (3a), (3b), and (3c) for a particular density n allows to calculate the xc
energy Exc for that density:

Exc(n) := FHK(n) − EH(n) − T s(n)

However, given an arbitrary density vector n, only EH(n) is trivial to compute:
FHK(n) requires the knowledge of the external potential as a function of the density,
(n), and T s(n) requires the knowledge of the eﬀective non-interacting Kohn-
vext
l = vext
Sham potential vs
l (n). This process of calculating the external potential vl(n),
in which the ground state has the given density n, is called inversion and can be
performed eﬃciently only in the non-interacting case or for two fermions [25].
In
general, there exists no eﬃcient inversion procedure for the interacting case and we
use a slight modiﬁcation of the iteration proposed in [26, 27]: Aiming at the target
density ntar, we iterate vl(i + 1) = vl(i) + γ(i)(nl(i) − ntar
l ) until ||n(i) − ntar|| -
where || . . .|| denotes Euclidean norm - is below a desired precision threshold. Here,
n(i) is the ground state density in the external potential v(i) at the iteration step
i, and γ(i) > 0 is adjusted during the iterations to speed up the convergence.
Since interacting inversion necessitates several ground state computations to attain an
approximate solution, it is not eﬃcient. Even more sophisticated iteration schemes
cannot circumvent that some densities require incredibly many iterations, i.e. ground

state computations, until convergence [28]. Therefore, in general, interacting inversion
represents a computationally demanding task.

3. Exact LDA

As the exact form of Exc from (4) is not known, in practice, approximations are used.
One of the simplest and most successful approximations is the LDA [2, 20].

The exact LDA eLDA

xc

is deﬁned via the homogeneous electron gas, i.e. via exactly
homogeneous densities n = (n1, n2, . . . , nL)T = (n, n, . . . , n)T in the thermodynamic
limit L → ∞ [2, 20]:

This quantity is then used to approximate the xc energy of a ﬁnite system by

(6)

xc

Because E LDA
(n) is the exact xc energy for exactly homogeneous densities in the
thermodynamic limit, it represents a good approximation for relatively homogeneous
densities on large lattices L >> 1.

Our feasibility study here assumes a relatively small

lattice of size L = 21
with hard-wall boundary conditions, such that ﬁnite size and boundary eﬀects play
a role. We therefore derive our own LDA for this system and do not make use of the
existing results in [29]. Figure 1 shows our exc(n) obtained from numerically exactly
homogeneous densities computed by means of non-interacting (for T s(n)) and interacting
(for FHK(n)) inversions on L = 21 lattice sites for all possible total particle numbers
N = 0, 1, . . . , 42. To allow for an eﬃcient evaluation of E LDA
, we parametrize the
function exc(n) using a ﬁnite number of parameters. A simple way to achieve this is to
assume a polynomial form pd(n) of certain degree d and to ﬁt our results using diﬀerent

xc

Density functionals with the help of MPS

values of d. In the ﬁt of each polynomial pd(n), we impose the physically reasonable
constraint pd(0) = 0 = pd(2), which trivially holds for the exact Exc, as can be seen
in (4): Obviously exc(0) = Exc(0, 0, . . . , 0)/L = 0 because every term in (4) vanishes
independently for zero total particle number, and exc(2) = Exc(2, 2, . . . , 2)/L = 0
because FHK(2, 2, . . . , 2) = EH(2, 2, . . . , 2) and T s(2, 2, . . . , 2) = 0 due to impossible
tunneling. Apparently, our exact LDA exc is well approximated by polynomials of low
degree d since, on the scale of ﬁgure 1, the d = 8 ﬁt seems indistinguishable from the
d = 4 ﬁt.

The LDA resides on the lowest rung of “Jacob’s ladder” [17] and the most successful
approximations of Exc beyond the LDA were built on top of it [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
Analogously, we will use the LDA computed above as our reference, and we will try to
improve upon it with a more general ansatz for the functional.

4. Our ansatz

Our approach for the construction of an improved xc energy approximation consists of
two parts. Firstly, it requires an eﬃcient variational density functional ansatz, denoted
by G, to approximate Exc. Secondly, a set of M external potentials has to be speciﬁed,
which will be called training scenario, such that the corresponding M exact ground state
densities nt, called training densities, and exact values Exc(nt) are used to determine
G by minimizing a cost function

M

d(G) :=

X
t=1 |Exc(nt) − G(nt)|2

over the variational parameters of G.

(7)

We are interested in an ansatz that, ﬁrstly, includes the LDA and, secondly, allows
for a systematic improvement over it by including non-local terms. In this spirit, we
propose a two-site ansatz of the following form:

GX(n) :=

X

X

k=0

Gk(n)

with

Gk=0(n) :=

Gk>0(n) :=

L

X

l=1

L−k

X

l=1

g0(nl)

gk(nl, nl+k)

.

(8)

(9a)

(9b)

For X = 0, we have G(n) = GX=0(n) = Gk=0(n), which is completely analogous to
the LDA (6). And for X > 0, the k > 0 terms allow for a more general dependence on
the density with two-site functions over a range limited by X. In this way, increasing
X allows us to systematically include more non-local information and to go beyond the
local LDA.

Figure 2. Local terms g0(n) from the “homogeneous” training scenario with N = 6
(dotted), 12 (dashed), and 30 (solid), compared to the exact LDA (crosses).

In order to have a practical functional, we want to write it in terms of a discrete
set of variational parameters. Thus we need to restrict the form of the functions gk. For
simplicity we choose here a polynomial form for each term, as we did in the previous
section 3 for the reference LDA.

t=1 |(Exc)t − (Ac)t|2.

s=0 c0

sns

t=1 |Exc(nt) − G(nt)|2 = PM

When G(n) is assumed to be a polynomial of the nl, the variational parameters of
G are the polynomial coeﬃcients. Then the desired argminGd(G), i.e. the argument of d
that minimizes the cost function, results from the solution of linear equations Ac = Exc
where the polynomial coeﬃcients of G are vectorized in c, the exact values are vectorized
in Exc, and the elements in the matrix A establish the correct connection to the cost
function (7): d(G) = PM
We want to emphasize that this approach does not need any computationally
demanding interacting inversion. Because the training densities nt follow from the
training potentials, i.e. from M diﬀerent choices of vext in (3a), we know FHK(nt). While
the calculation of EH(nt) is trivial, T s(nt) is computed via eﬃcient non-interacting
inversion. Thus, all further ingredients for Exc(nt) of (4) are then eﬃciently computable.
The ﬁrst step in our approach is to consider the ansatz G = G0, with g0(nl) :=
Pd
s. The simplest possible,
“homogeneous”, training scenario amounts to setting vext
l = 0, in which case we have
one training density for each possible total particle number N = 1, 2, . . . , 2L, i.e. at
most M = 42 for L = 21. Figure 2 demonstrates how training our local term g0 with
such ground states reproduces the exact LDA. Remarkably, a very good match between
our g0 and the exact LDA is achieved already with M = 30 ground state computations.
This has to be compared to the several thousands of ground state computations that
were required for ﬁgure 1 due to the interacting inversion iteration.

l a polynomial in nl of degree d with coeﬃcients c0

We can understand that the “homogeneous” training scenario leads to the exact
LDA because this scenario contains relatively homogeneous training densities and
because the exact LDA is constructed from exactly homogeneous densities. Now
we want to consider more inhomogeneous densities and for that purpose we propose

are characterized by a

the “step” training scenario shown in ﬁgure 3. This scenario allows us to generate
much larger training sets since we deﬁne it by free choice of: a) the step position
(from l = 2, 3, 4, . . . , 21), b) the step height (from h = 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 2.0), c) the step
orientation (left or right), and d) the total particle number (from N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 30).
We do not include total particle numbers N larger than 30 in this training set because we
want it to contain suﬃciently inhomogeneous densities that become more inhomogeneous
when the step height increases; clearly, for large total particle numbers such as more
than 30 fermions on 21 lattice sites, an increasing step height quickly creates large
homogeneous regions of maximum ﬁlling in the density, i.e. having 2 fermions per lattice
site.

We have investigated two diﬀerent ways of converging G with this “step” training
scenario. In the ﬁrst way, we pick M ground states randomly and study the convergence
of G as a function of M. In the second way, we ﬁx the total particle numbers considered
to N = 1, 2, . . . , 12, take all possible step positions and orientations, and increase M
systematically together with the step height. In both schemes, convergence is quantiﬁed
by comparison of the solution for M with the solution for the largest considered Mmax,
which we ﬁxed to 12800 for the random and to 9612 for the systematic densities. We
can then look at the quantity

ǫ(M) := h|Ci(M) − Ci(Mmax)|/|Ci(Mmax)|i

(10)

i=1 . . . denotes taking the mean value over all P possible values of i.

where Ci(M) denotes the ith parameter of G after training with M densities and
h. . .i := 1/P PP
Figure 4 shows our results for random densities. Interestingly, this training scenario
gives rise to local terms g0 that are very similar to the exact LDA, although many
training densities of this scenario are very inhomogeneous. Furthermore, we can read
oﬀ from the inset of ﬁgure 4 that convergence occurs rapidly.

To go beyond the LDA, we now include the longer-range two-site terms with k > 0

in (8) using a general polynomial ansatz:

gk(nl, nl+k) :=

d

X

s0,sk=0

s0,skns0
ck

l nsk

l+k

,

(11)

i.e. these terms are general degree d polynomials of the density values on 2 lattice
sites separated by distance k. While, as discussed above, for X = 0, our ansatz
G0(n) = PL
l=1 g0(nl) is completely analogous to the LDA of (6), for X > 0, it contains

additional non-local terms, such that, by systematically increasing X in our ansatz
GX(n), we can systematically increase its non-locality beyond the local LDA-like term.
We enforce in our desired solution GX that the terms gk for increasing k are obtained
one after another such that each additional non-local term (i.e. corresponding to the
next larger value of k) is a correction to the previous solution. This means that, for
given X, we ﬁrst minimize (7) only via the parameters c0 which gives G0. Then we
minimize (7) for the remainder E 1
xc(nt) := Exc(nt) − G0(nt) only via the parameters c1
which together with the previous solution c0 gives G1. Then we minimize (7) for the
xc(nt) := Exc(nt) − G1(nt) only via the parameters c2 which together with
remainder E 2
the previous solutions c0 and c1 gives G1. We continue the scheme until we have reached
cX and thus GX . This procedure ensures that each longer-range term is built on top of
all previous shorter-ranged ones, in the same way as the functionals on higher rungs of
“Jacob’s ladder” are more non-local and are built on top of the more local functionals
on the lower rungs [17].

In order to analyze the performance of the ansatz, we adopt now a diﬀerent strategy.
We will now always ﬁt our ansatz GX with the “step” training scenario of ﬁgure 3 and
then we will apply it to completely diﬀerent target densities. For the latter, we choose
ground states of the H2 dissociation problem, i.e. Hamiltonian (1) with total particle
number N = 2 and external potential

physical application that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from our training scenario, we consider

it to be a very good benchmark for our approach.

From now on, the local terms g0(n) in our two-site polynomial ansatz (8) are ﬁxed
to be the exact LDA from ﬁgure 1. And the non-local terms gk>0(n1, n2) are enforced to
fulﬁll gk>0(0, 0) = 0 = gk>0(2, 2) as well as gk>0(n1, n2) = gk>0(n2, n1). These properties
are physically reasonable and they reduce the number of variational parameters, which
turned out to be beneﬁcial for the convergence of our ﬁt. We distinguish two diﬀerent
versions of our ansatz, namely constrained and unconstrained. In our constrained two-
site polynomial ansatz we determine gk>0(n1, n2) under the constraint gk>0(n, n) = 0:
then GX(n) is exact for exactly homogeneous densities n = (n, n, . . . , n)T.
In our
unconstrained two-site polynomial ansatz we do not impose this constraint on the
polynomial coeﬃcients: the unconstrained ansatz has thus more variational parameters
than the constrained ansatz.

Figure 5 shows our results after convergence with M systematic densities. As we
can see in (a), the constrained ansatz leads to a visible improvement over LDA close to
R = 0, but not for larger R. A convergence of the non-local terms can be concluded
from the inset. In (b), the unconstrained ansatz leads to an improvement over LDA for
almost all values of R, but it produces too low energy values close to R = 0. The inset
of (b) demonstrates that convergence of the non-local terms occurs, however, for k > 1
this convergence is slower than in (a). With increasing X, our ansatz systematically
improves the LDA result at speciﬁc values of R: around R = 0 when the constrained
version is used, and at larger R when the unconstrained version is used. Both versions
of our ansatz show a systematic improvement over LDA with increasing X when the
mean energy for all values of R is considered. In fact, such a mean value is the correct
ﬁgure of merit because the cost function (7), minimized for “step” training densities by
our ansatz, is also a mean value of many xc energies.

Clearly, we would like to use GX (n) to compute densities self-consistently via
the KS cycle. A ﬁrst step in this direction is the calculation of the xc potential
vxc
l (n) := −∂Exc/∂nl|n for the exact ground state density n. In the H2 dissociation
problem, the xc potential for larger values of R is particularly interesting, since its
exact form exhibits a characteristic peak that cannot be reproduced by LDA alone [30].
Figure 6 shows our results for R = 5. While our constrained ansatz leads to a potential
that basically coincides with the one from LDA, our unconstrained ansatz leads to a
small systematic improvement with increasing X.

5. Conclusions

We have analyzed the feasibility of constructing semi-empirical approximations for the
xc density functional in the context of a long-range interacting many-electron system on
a one-dimensional lattice. Using numerically exact ground states from MPS simulations,
we proposed to ﬁt an ansatz that includes an LDA-like part plus additional terms of
increasing non-locality, by means of reasonably chosen training densities. We observed
that our ansatz converges systematically within the training scenario. Additionally,
when applied to completely diﬀerent target densities, namely of the H2 dissociation
problem, our ﬁtted ansatz improved upon the LDA systematically. This systematic
improvement was demonstrated for the ground state energies of the H2 problem and for
a xc potential corresponding to a stretched H2 molecule.

In this work, we have tested the eﬀect of a systematic inclusion of non-local
ingredients in the functional using very simple ansaetze for the non-local terms, namely
only two-site dependences, and for the functional form, namely only polynomials, and
we considered only one training scenario. We can construct more elaborate versions
of the ansatz by including other non-local dependences, or using functional forms for
each term that are not restricted to polynomials. In particular, we may add terms that
depend on three variable densities, or impose a functional form in terms of cubic splines.
While such improved ansaetze must deﬁnitely further improve the results reported here,

their dependence on the training scenario and the number of training densities has to be
carefully studied. In a ﬁrst attempt of ﬁtting three-site terms of three variable densities,
we could not observe a clear convergence with as many as ≈ 20000 densities from the
“step” training scenario, clearly indicating that a diﬀerent training scenario has to be
used then.

In this article, we focused exclusively on approximations of the density functional
for the xc energy. However, in principle, any ground state observable can be written as
a functional of the ground state density [1]. Our proposed scheme allows in principle to
also construct systematically density functionals for observables other than the ground
state energy. This fact might now be useful for ultracold atoms in optical lattices since
the densities of these systems have become experimentally accessible with remarkable
resolution [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Measurements of a certain observable which are
diﬃcult to perform with the current techniques might be easier to carry out now when
a density functional would be provided for that observable. Particularly interesting
measurements regard two-dimensional systems with special observables, such as e.g.

special order parameters. The corresponding density functionals could be constructed
with the help of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) [39]. Because experiments are
restricted to ﬁnite system sizes, PEPS algorithms are perfectly suited for the ground
state simulation of such ﬁnite two-dimensional systems, for which they can produce
accurate numerical results [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45].
