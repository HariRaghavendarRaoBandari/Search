Abstract

In this paper, we will consider scattering diagrams in the context of inﬁnite-
derivative theories. First, we examine a ﬁnite-order higher-derivative scalar ﬁeld
theory and ﬁnd that we cannot eliminate the external momentum divergences of
scattering diagrams in the regime of large external momenta. Then, we employ
an inﬁnite-derivative scalar toy model and obtain that the external momentum
dependence of scattering diagrams is convergent as the external momenta be-
come very large.
In order to eliminate the external momentum divergences,
one has to dress the bare vertices of the scattering diagrams by considering
renormalised propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices. Fi-
nally, we investigate scattering diagrams in the context of a scalar toy model
which is inspired by a ghost-free and singularity-free inﬁnite-derivative theory
of gravity, where we conclude that inﬁnite derivatives can eliminate the ex-
ternal momentum divergences of scattering diagrams and make the scattering
diagrams convergent in the ultraviolet.

Scattering diagrams play an important role in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). By
studying scattering diagrams, one can obtain the scattering matrix element and, ul-
timately, the cross section. A cross section that blows up at high energies indicates

1

an unphysical theory. Typically, in non-renormalisable theories, the cross section
blows up at ﬁnite-order, see [1]. For instance, higher than 2-derivative scalar ﬁeld
theories are one such example. Another example is indeed General Relativity (GR);
also, in supergravity, see [2], where high-energy scatterings of gravitons have been
studied. Besides studying whether the amplitudes are ﬁnite or not, there are very
interesting applications in cosmology and in formation of mini black holes in trans-
Plankian scatterings of plane waves [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In all these cases,
the cross section of a scattering diagram, especially involving gravitons, blows up
for large external momenta, i.e., in the ultraviolet (UV). On the other hand, string
theory has been conjectured to be UV-ﬁnite [12]; however, the problem here lies in
higher-order corrections in string coupling gs and α(cid:48), which would naturally induce
corrections beyond Einstein-Hilbert action. Unfortunately, many of these corrections
cannot be computed so easily in a time-dependent cosmological background. Never-
theless, there has been many studies in a ﬁxed background in the context of string
scatterings, see [13, 14], see for details [12, 15]. Indeed, none of these analyses mo-
tivated from strings or supergravity can probe the region of space-time singularity;
neither string theory nor supergravity in its current form can avoid forming a black
hole or cosmological singularity. Besides string theory, there are other approaches
of quantum gravity, such as in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) [16, 17], or in Causal
Set approach [18], where it is possible to setup similar physical problems to study
the behaviour at short distances and at small time scales, as well as high momentum
scatterings.

One common thread in all these quantum and semiclassical approaches is the
presence of non-locality, where the interactions happen in a ﬁnite region of spacetime.
It has been conjectured by many that such non-local interactions may ameliorate the
UV behaviour of scattering amplitudes, see [8, 9, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28], see also Refs. [29, 30, 31, 32] for ﬁnite temperature eﬀects of non-local ﬁeld
theories. It is also expected that any such realistic theory of quantum gravity should
be able to resolve short-distance and small-timescale singular behaviour present in
Einstein’s gravity, both in static and in time-dependent backgrounds. Indeed, close
to the singularity or close to super-Planckian energies, one would naturally expect
higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Such higher-derivative
corrections may as well open a door for non-local interactions in a very interesting
way.

Typically, higher derivatives present a problem of ghost. For instance, it is well
known that a quadratic curvature gravity is renormalisable, but would contain ghosts
by virtue of having four derivatives in the equation of motion. The issue of ghost
persists for any ﬁnite-order, higher than 2-derivative theory for any spin. The issue
of ghosts can be addressed in the context of an inﬁnite-derivative theory of gravity, see
Refs. [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The graviton propagator is deﬁnitely modiﬁed in this case
as compared to the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, if the modiﬁcation is such that
it introduces no new extra propagating degrees of freedom, other than the original

2

massless graviton, then it is possible to avoid ghosts 1.

In particular, in Ref. [35], the authors constructed the most general covariant
construction of quadratic-order gravity with inﬁnite derivatives around Minkowski
background. Similar construction isalso possible around any constant-curvature back-
grounds such as in deSitter and (anti)-deSitter backgrounds [40] 2. In all these con-
structions [35, 40], it is possible to make the graviton propagator ghost free, with no
additions poles, other than the familiar 2 massless degrees of freedom of Einstein-
Hilbert action, by assuming that any modiﬁcation which occur as a result of inﬁnite
derivatives can be expressed by an entire function. An entire function as such does
not introduce any pole in the complex plane. Furthermore, if the choice of an entire
function is such that it falls oﬀ in the UV exponentially, while in the IR the function
approaches unity in order to match the expectations of GR, then it can indeed soften
the UV aspects of gravitational interactions. The fact that the propagator becomes
exponentially suppressed in the UV, also leads to exponential enhancement in the ver-
tex operator by virtue of derivative interactions. The interplay between the vertices
and propagator give rise to this non-locality in gravity in the UV. Indeed, this non-
locality is responsible for some nice properties, such as the resolution of cosmological
and black hole type singularities 3.

For instance, it has been shown that for the above construction, it is possible to
avoid cosmological singularity for a ﬂat Universe Refs. [34, 35, 42, 43, 44], which yields
naturally a UV modiﬁcation for Starobinsky inﬂation [45, 46] 4. It is also possible
to avoid a black hole singularity in the linearised limit; the Newtonian potential is
always ﬁnite in the UV in the limit r → 0, close to the source, see Ref. [35, 47, 48].
In Refs. [49, 50, 51], authors have studied the time-dependent spherical collapse of
matter for such non-local gravity [35], and found that the singularity can be resolved
at a linear regime. Such time-dependent results are remarkable and clearly absent in
Einstein Gravity and in ﬁnite-order higher-derivative modiﬁcations of gravity, such
as in 4th derivative gravity [52, 53].

Furthermore, In Ref. [54], a toy model has been constructed inspired by an inﬁnite-
derivative extension of quadratic order gravity. Within this framework, quantum
properties have been investigated, where UV divergences originating from Feynman
diagrams have been studied explicitly up to 2-loop order, and it was found that the
Feynman diagrams become ﬁnite. A generic prescription was also provided on how
to make higher loops ﬁnite and, in fact, renormalisable [54].

1Inﬁnite derivatives are also present in (open) string ﬁeld theory [38] and in p-adic strings [39].

One would naturally expect them to be present from higher-order α(cid:48) corrections.

2The quadratic curvature action is parity-invariant and torsion-free in both these cases [35, 40].
3In [41], one can see examples of non-local ﬁeld theories which are not inﬁnite-derivative ones;
however, the approach cannot be helpful to address how to ameliorate the singularity problems at
short distances and small time scales.

4For a closed Universe, it is possible to avoid cosmological singularity without introducing inﬁnite
derivatives, but for a ﬂat Universe the underlying problem is indeed hard and requires softening of
gravity in the UV [34, 35].

Inspired by these recent developments, the aim of this paper is to study the high
energy scatterings for ghost-free and inﬁnite-derivative theories. We will study the s,
t, u channels of scattering diagrams for a scalar ﬁeld theory. In this respect we will
be extending some of earlier the computations of Refs. [28] and [54]. We will also
study scattering diagrams within the scalar toy model of inﬁnite-derivative quadratic
curvature ghost-free and singularity-free gravity.
In particular, we will show the
following computations:

1. 2-derivative massless scalar ﬁeld, with higher derivative interactions:
We will consider tree-level scattering diagrams, computed in Euclidean space.
Then, we will look at the external momentum dependence of the scattering
diagram if we insert a 1-loop diagram in the middle. Next, we will replace
the bare propagator in the tree-level diagram with the dressed one and see how
the external momentum dependence of the diagram is modiﬁed. Finally, we will
consider scattering diagrams with dressed vertices and propagators. In all cases,
we will ﬁnd that the scattering diagrams blow up in the UV limit. We will also
compute the scattering diagrams by taking into account dressed propagators
and dressed vertices, and the result would be the same.

2. Inﬁnite-derivative Lagrangian and interactions: The results of the ﬁrst
computation motivate us to study a ghost-free, inﬁnite-derivative Lagrangian
with interaction terms containing inﬁnite derivatives. We will show that the
scattering amplitude still blows up with and without dressed propagator. How-
ever, dressing the vertices by taking renormalised propagator and vertex loop
corrections to the bare vertices eliminates the external momentum divergences
of the scattering amplitudes in the limit of the centre-of-mass energy going to
inﬁnity.

3. Scalar toy model of inﬁnite-derivative, ghost-free and singularity-free
gravity: By taking the cue from our previous computations, we will then
study a scalar toy model motivated from an inﬁnite-derivative, ghost-free and
singularity-free theory of gravity [34, 35, 54]. We will show that a similar con-
clusion holds true for this class of action, where dressing the vertices by taking
both propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices makes, at suf-
ﬁciently high loop order, the external momentum dependence of any scattering
diagram convergent in the UV.

The paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we introduce a ﬁnite-order higher-
derivative scalar ﬁeld theory and examine the UV external momentum dependence
of scattering diagrams. In section 3, we write down an inﬁnite-derivative scalar ﬁeld
theory and study the external momentum dependence of scattering diagrams.
In
section 4, we investigate external momentum dependence of scatterings of a scalar
ﬁeld theory analogue of inﬁnite-derivative theory of gravity, and in section 5, we
conclude by summarising our results.

in appendix A for the deﬁnition of σ) also blows up as s → −∞.

2.1 Dressing the propagator

Since the tree-level amplitude blows up, we should now study the 1-loop, 2-point func-
tion in the propagator for the above interaction, see Eq. (2.1). We can compute the

i.e., in the limit s → −∞, Γ2,1r(−s) ∝ (p1 + p2)8 = s4, where Γ2,1r is the renormalised

Now what if we had an inﬁnite series of loops in the scattering diagrams, see Fig. 5
(top), that is, if we had replaced the bare propagator with the dressed propagator?
As we shall see below, the external momentum dependence of the 1-loop, 2-point
function shall actually determine the UV behaviour of the dressed propagator.

The dressed propagator, see Fig. 5 (top), represents the geometric series of all the
graphs with 1-loop, 2-point insertions, analytically continued to the entire complex

p2-plane. Mathematically, the dressed propagator, (cid:101)Π(p2), is given by [54]

Since we have that Tdressed = T s−channel

, one can verify
that the total cross section σdressed corresponding to Tdressed blows up as s → −∞.
The summary is that the dressed propagator is not suﬃcient to prevent the scattering
diagram from blowing up as s → −∞ since the polynomial suppression coming from
the dressed propagator cannot overcome the polynomial enhancement originating
from the two bare vertices in Fig. 5 (bottom). In subsection 2.2, we shall dress the
vertices to see whether we can eliminate the external momentum divergences of the
scattering diagrams.

After integration with respect to the internal loop momentum k and renormalisation
of the loop integral divergences, i.e., the terms involving powers of Λ, we are left with
a polynomial function of the three external momenta p1, p2, p3. We will require these
computations in the following subsection.

(2.25)

2.2 Dressing the vertices by making vertex loop corrections

to the bare vertices

Based on the results of subsection 2.1.1, suppose we want to dress the vertices by
making renormalised vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-
ends of the scattering diagrams, see Fig. 7. As we saw in Eq. (2.25), both the bare
propagators and the bare vertices can be written in terms of powers of momenta. After
integration with respect to the internal loop momentum k, we obtain a polynomial
expression involving powers of the external momenta p1, p2, p3. As the loop-order
increases, the 3-point function can still be written as a polynomial function of the
external momenta; this happens because, as previously, the (bare) propagators are
polynomials in momenta while the (dressed) vertices are also polynomials in momenta.

Figure 7: 3-point diagram constructed out of lower-loop 2-point & 3-point diagrams. The
dark blobs indicate renormalised vertex corrections and the dashed lines inside the triangle
denote bare internal propagators. The loop order of the dark blob on the left is n while the
loop order of the dark blobs on the right is n − 1. The external momenta are p1, p2, p3 and
3 − p1
the internal (that is, inside the loop) momenta are k + p1

Therefore, we expect the external momentum dependence of the 3-point function, see

momenta, p1, p2, p3, to follow as:

(2.26)

(2.27)

The reason we expect the external momentum dependence of 3-point function to
be given by Eq. (2.26) is that, once all the (lower-) loop subdiagrams have been
integrated out, what remains are polynomial expressions in terms of the corresponding
external momenta. Some of these external momenta can then become the internal
loop momentum in a subsequent higher-loop diagram.

First, let us consider how one can get the largest sum of all the exponents, i.e.,
α + β + γ. Although all the arguments below can be conducted for three diﬀerent sets
of exponents in the three 3-point vertices making up the 1-loop triangle, see Fig. 7,
for simplicity, here we will look at what happens when all the three vertices have the
same exponents.

Clearly, the best way to obtain the largest exponents for the external momenta is
to have the α exponent correspond to the external momenta. Assuming a symmetric
distribution of (β, γ) among the internal loops and considering the n-loop, 3-point
diagram with symmetrical routing of momenta, see Fig. 7, the propagators in the

where p1, p2, p3 are the external momenta for the 1-loop triangle and the superscript
in the α, β, γ indicates that these are coeﬃcients that one obtains from contributions
up to n − 1 loop level. Now, let us proceed to obtain the n-th loop coeﬃcients. We
can read from Eq. (2.29):

αn = βn = γn = αn−1 + 2(βn−1 + γn−1) .

(2.30)

For 3-point bare vertices, we have now α0 = β0 = 1 and γ0 = 0. As n increases, αn,
βn and γn increase; this means that, as the number of loops increases, the external
momentum dependences of the dressed vertices become divergent for large momenta.

If we now dress the vertices by making renormalised vertex loop corrections to the
bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the tree-level scattering diagrams, we will
have, see Fig. 9 (for n ≥ 1, αn = βn = γn),

Since α0 = β0 = 1 and γ0 = 0, using Eq. (2.30), we can see that α1 = 3; therefore,
αn ≥ 3 for n ≥ 1. Hence, we can make the following observations from the above
expressions:

Thus, one can check that the cross section σdressed vertices corresponding to Tvertex corrections =

We see that dressing the vertices by making just vertex loop corrections to the
bare vertices does not ameliorate the external momentum divergences of scattering
diagrams in the UV in our example, see Eq. (2.1). In fact, it makes the divergences
even worse.
In the next subsection, we shall dress the vertices by making both
propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends
of the scattering diagrams.

2.3 Dressing the vertices by making propagator & vertex

loop corrections to the bare vertices

In this subsection, we shall dress the vertices by making renormalised propagator and
vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the scattering
diagrams, see Fig. 8. Again, we expect the external momentum dependence of the
3-point function to be given in the UV limit, i.e., as pi → ∞, where i = 1, 2, 3, by
Eq. (2.26).

As previously, the best way to obtain the largest exponents for the external mo-
menta is to have the α exponent correspond to the external momenta. Assuming
a symmetric distribution of (β, γ) among the internal loops and considering the n-
loop, 3-point diagram with symmetrical routing of momenta, see Fig. 8, the (dressed)

inspecting Eq. (2.36), we have

αn = βn = γn = αn−1 + 2(βn−1 + γn−1) .

(2.37)

For the 3-point bare vertices, we have that α0 = β0 = 1 and γ0 = 0. As n increases,

We see that dressing the vertices by making propagator and vertex loop corrections
to the bare vertices cannot ameliorate the UV external momentum divergences of
scattering diagrams in our toy model example, Eq. (2.1). This motivates us to consider
something very diﬀerent; in the following section, we shall not consider a 2-derivative
theory, but an inﬁnite-derivative massless scalar ﬁeld theory with cubic interaction in
φ. Both the free and interaction parts of the action will contain inﬁnite derivatives.

3 Scatterings in inﬁnite-derivative theory

We saw in section 2 that, within the context of a ﬁnite-order higher-derivative scalar
toy model, we cannot tame the UV external momentum divergences appearing in
scattering diagrams.
In particular, we need to “soften” the external momentum
contributions coming from the dressed vertices; as we saw in subsections 2.2 & 2.3,
dressing the vertices in a ﬁnite-order higher-derivative toy model cannot help us tame
the external momentum divergences of the scattering diagrams. Since this is not
possible for a ﬁnite-order higher-derivative toy model, we shall examine an inﬁnite-
derivative scalar toy model. Therefore, let us consider the following action, which has
a cubic interaction where λ (cid:28) O(1), and treat it perturbatively:

S = Sfree + Sint ,

(cid:90)

where

and

2

(cid:90)

Sfree =

Sint = λ

d4x (φ(cid:3)a((cid:3))φ)

d4x (φ(cid:3)φa((cid:3))φ) .

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

Now, let us demand that the propagator for free action retains only the massless
scalar degree of freedom. In which case, we assume that the kinetic term obtains an
entire function correction. For simplicity, we take such a function to be Gaussian:

a((cid:3)) = e−(cid:3)/M 2 ,

(3.4)

where M is the mass scale at which the non-local modiﬁcations become important.
With this choice, the inﬁnite-derivative theory can be made ghost-free [35, 36]. Such

15

a choice of a((cid:3)) is also well motivated by p-adic strings [39]. The propagator in
momentum space is then given in the Euclidean space, by

Π(k2) =

−i
k2e¯k2 ,

(3.5)

where barred 4-momentum vectors denote ¯k = k/M . The vertex factor for three
incoming momenta k1, k2, k3 satisfying the following conservation law,

k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 ,

(3.6)

is given by

Now, in order to compute the dressed propagator, we have, ﬁrst, to write down

the 1-loop, 2-point function with external momenta p and −p. We have

After renormalising the divergent (in terms of the internal loop momentum kµ)
terms 7, we have that the most divergent part (in terms of the external momentum
pµ) of the 1-loop, 2-point function is given by

iλ2M 4e

Thus, the renormalised 1-loop, 2-point function goes as (1+4¯p−2)e

3.1 Dressing the propagator

Since for large p, the dressed propagator goes as

we observe that the dressed propagator is more strongly exponentially suppressed
than the bare propagator.

Since

iTdressed = λ2V (p1, p2,−p1 − p2)V (−p3,−p4, p1 + p2)(cid:101)Π(−s)
+ λ2V (p1,−p3, p3 − p1)V (p2,−p4, p1 − p3)(cid:101)Π(−t)

, one can verify that the total
cross section σdressed corresponding to Tdressed blows up as s → −∞. We also observe
that the external momentum dependence of Tdressed is less divergent for large external
momenta as compared to the external momentum dependence of Ttree−level (or T1−loop).
To conclude, the use of the dressed propagator ameliorates the external momen-
tum divergences of the scattering diagrams, but this is not suﬃcient by itself.
In
subsection 3.2, we shall dress the vertices to see whether we can eliminate the exter-
nal momentum divergences of the scattering diagrams.

3.2 Dressing the vertices by making vertex loop corrections

to the bare vertices

In this subsection, we shall dress the vertices by making renormalised vertex loop
corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the scattering diagrams,
see Fig. 7. We have that both the bare propagators and the bare vertices can be
written as exponentials in momenta; after integration with respect to the internal
loop momentum k, we obtain an exponential expression where the exponents are in
terms of the external momenta p1, p2, p3. As the loop-order increases, the 3-point
function can still be written as an exponential function of the external momenta; this
happens because, as previously, the (bare) propagators are exponentials in momenta
while the (dressed) vertices are also exponentials in momenta.Thus, in the UV limit,
i.e., as pi → ∞, where i = 1, 2, 3, the 3-point function, again see Fig. 7, can be
written as

where p1, p2, p3 are the three external momenta. The reason we expect the external
momentum dependence of the 3-point function to be given by Eq. (3.18) is that,
once all the (lower-) loop subdiagrams have been integrated out, what remains are
exponential expressions in terms of the three external momenta p1, p2, p3.

The best way to obtain the largest exponents for the external momenta is to
have the α exponent correspond to the external momenta. Assuming a symmetric
distribution of (β, γ) among the internal loops and considering the n-loop, 3-point
diagram with symmetrical routing of momenta, see Fig. 7, the propagators in the

where p1, p2, p3 are the external momenta for the 1-loop triangle, and the superscript

up to n − 1 loop level.

Integrating Eq. (3.22) with respect to the loop momentum k and reminding our-
3, respectively, appearing

selves that αn, βn and γn are the coeﬃcients of ¯p2

that, as n increases, αn, βn and γn increase; this means that, as the number of loops
increases, the external momentum contributions of the dressed vertices become more

We conclude that dressing the vertices by considering just vertex loop corrections
to the bare vertices does not ameliorate the external momentum divergences of scat-
tering diagrams in the UV in our toy model example Eq. (3.1); in fact, it makes
those divergences even worse. In the next subsection, we shall dress the vertices by
considering both propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices.

3.3 Dressing the vertices by making propagator & vertex

loop corrections to the bare vertices

As our next step, let us now consider Tdressed
8. We know that Tdressed diverges as
s → −∞. Let us now dress the vertices by making renormalised propagator and
vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the diagram.

Regarding the dressed propagator, we have (cid:101)Π(p2) U V−→ e−3¯p2/2. Therefore, following

the prescription given in section 3.2, the 3-point function can again be written as an
exponential function of the external momenta; this happens because, as previously,
the (dressed) propagators are exponentials in momenta while the (dressed) vertices
are also exponentials in momenta. Hence, in the UV limit, i.e., as pi → ∞, where
i = 1, 2, 3, the 3-point function Γ3, see Fig. 8, is again given by Eq. (3.18). As
previously, the best way to obtain the largest exponents for the external momenta is
to have the α exponent correspond to the external momenta. Assuming a symmetric
distribution of (β, γ) among the internal loops and considering the n-loop, 3-point
diagram with symmetrical routing of momenta, see Fig. 8, the propagators in the
1-loop triangle are given by

where p1, p2, p3 are the external momenta for the 1-loop triangle, and the superscript
in the α, β, γ indicates that these are coeﬃcients that one obtains from contributions
up to n − 1 loop level.

After integrating Eq. (3.27) with respect to the loop momentum k, one obtains

αn = βn = γn = αn−1 +

(3.28)
8We could equally well consider Ttree−level, T1−loop, etc. By making renormalised propagator &
vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the scattering diagram
under consideration, the external momentum divergences would be eliminated at suﬃciently high
loop order.

For the 3-point bare vertices, we have α0 = 1 and β0 = γ0 = 0. Employing Eq. (3.28),
one then obtains

α1 = β1 = γ1 =

.

(3.29)

2

We observe that α1 + β1 + γ1 = 3
2. We anticipate that the exponents become smaller
as the loop order becomes larger; hence, we posit that the following inequality holds:

αn + βn + γn ≤ 3
2

.

(3.30)

Using Eq. (3.28), we see that Eq. (3.30) is satisﬁed as long as the following condition
is also satisﬁed:

αn−1 +

(βn−1 + γn−1) ≤ 1 .

(3.31)
To recap, we have shown that if, up to loop order n−1, Eq. (3.31) holds, then, at loop
order n, Eq. (3.30) holds too. In order to conclude the recursive argument (see [54]
for more details regarding the recursive argument), we have to show that Eq. (3.31)
holds at loop order n as well. Consequently, we have

< 1 .

(3.32)

We have veriﬁed that Eq. (3.31) does hold at loop order n. As a result, the loops stay
ﬁnite as the loop order increases.

Now, since α1 = β1 = γ1 = 1

2, and using Eq. (3.28),we obtain that, for n = 2,

for n = 3,

for n = 4,

α2 = β2 = γ2 =

α3 = β3 = γ3 =

α4 = β4 = γ4 = −11

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

We conclude that, for n ≥ 4, αn, βn and γn become negative. The fact that αn,
βn and γn become negative for suﬃciently large n should be emphasised, since it is
precisely this negativity which eliminates the external momentum divergences of any
scattering diagram in the UV.

For n = 4, we have the following results:
• We ﬁnd that the most divergent external momentum contribution of the s-

channel, see Fig. 9, goes as

e
which tends to 0 as s → −∞.

goes as

which, again, tends to 0 as s → −∞ for all values of θ.

(3.38)
which, again, tends to 0 as s → −∞ for all values of θ. Hence, for suﬃciently
large n (speciﬁcally, for n ≥ 4), there is no exponential divergence for the s-, t-
and u-channels as s → −∞.

2M 2 = e

108M 2

,

s(213+125 cos θ)

Let us also point out that we do not have to worry about polynomial divergences
in s since any polynomial functions of s will be multiplied by exponential functions
of s and their product will tend to 0 as s → −∞, keeping in mind that exponential
functions always dominate polynomial ones at large values.

Dressing the vertices by making both propagator and vertex loop corrections to the
bare vertices ameliorates and, in fact, completely eliminates, for suﬃciently large n,
the external momentum divergences of any scattering diagram in the UV. In the next
section, we will study an inﬁnite-derivative scalar toy model inspired by a ghost-free
and singularity-free theory of gravity.

4 Scattering in inﬁnite-derivative theories of grav-

ity

Inspired by the results of previous section, let us now investigate scattering diagrams
in the context of inﬁnite-derivative theories of gravity, which is ghost free and singu-
larity free, for brevity we call it BGKM gravity [35]. In [54], we studied the quantum
loops for an inﬁnite-derivative scalar ﬁeld theory action as a toy model to mimic
the UV properties of the BGKM gravity. Expanding the BGKM action around the
Minkowski vacuum 9, one can obtain, for instance, the “free” part that determines the
propagator from the O(h2) terms; hµν denotes a small perturbation around Minkowski
spacetime: gµν = ηµν + hµν. The O(h3) terms determine cubic interaction vertices.
Unfortunately, O(h3) terms are technically challenging and some of the expressions
involve double sums.
Instead of getting involved with too many technicalities, we
shall, therefore, choose to work with a simple toy model action that respects a com-
bination of shift and scaling symmetry at the level of equation of motion. This will

9One could expand the BGKM action and, subsequently, derive the propagator for a diﬀerent
background metric such as AdS [40]. Computing graviton-graviton scattering diagrams in AdS is a
topic for future investigation.

22

allow us to capture some of the essential features of BGKM gravity, such as the com-
pensating nature of exponential suppression in the propagator and an exponential
enhancement in the vertex factor.

The inﬁnite-derivative action that can modify the propagator of the graviton with-

out introducing any new states is of the form [35]

where the Fi’s are analytic functions of (cid:3) (the covariant d’Alembertian operator):

satisfying

n=0

2F1 + F2 + 2F3 = 0 ,

and the constraint that the combination

a((cid:3)) = 1 − 1
2

F2((cid:3))(cid:3) − 2F3((cid:3))(cid:3) ,

is an entire function with no zeroes.
In Eq. (4.4), the fin’s are real coeﬃcients.
Eqs. (4.1)-(4.6) deﬁne the BGKM gravity models. For BGKM gravity, we have the
propagator [35, 36],

Since we know that the ﬁeld equations of GR exhibit a global scaling symmetry,

When we expand the metric around the Minkowski vacuum,

gµν → λgµν .

gµν = ηµν + hµν ,

23

(4.8)

(4.9)

the scaling symmetry translates to a symmetry for hµν, whose inﬁnitesimal version is
given by

hµν → (1 + )hµν + ηµν .

(4.10)

The symmetry relates the free and interaction terms just like gauge symmetry does.
Thus, we are going to use this combination of shift and scaling symmetry,

φ → (1 + )φ +  ,

(4.11)

to arrive at a scalar toy model, whose propagator and vertices preserve the compen-
sating nature found in the full BGKM gravity. Now, let us write down explicitly the
scalar toy model action and the Feynman rules for that action, i.e., the propagator
and the vertex factors. Our scalar toy model action is given by:

For the purpose of this paper, we are going to choose:

where M is the mass scale at which the non-local modiﬁcations become important.
The propagator in momentum space for Eq. (4.13) is then given by

For the above set-up, 1-loop, 2-point diagram, both with zero and arbitrary external
momenta have been computed in Ref. [54], which gives a Λ4 divergence, where Λ

24

is a momentum cut-oﬀ. Further, 1-loop, N -point diagrams with vanishing external
momenta were also computed. The 2-loop diagrams with zero external momenta also
give a Λ4 divergence, suggesting that we do not get new divergences as we proceed
from 1-loop to 2-loop.
In Ref. [54], the authors have computed 1-loop and 2-loop
computations with external momenta and paid extra care in understanding the 1-
loop, 2-point function which appeared as a subdivergence in higher-loop diagrams.

Typically, in the 1-loop, 2-point function, the authors obtained e

3 ¯p2
2 external mo-
mentum dependence in the UV, which indicates that, for ¯p2 → ∞, the 1-loop, 2-point
function tends to inﬁnity. This may appear as an initial setback, but, actually, this
external momentum dependence is what, we believe, makes all higher-loop and higher-
point diagrams ﬁnite once the bare propagators were replaced by dressed propagators.
The dressed propagator is given by (see Ref. [54])

(cid:101)Π(p2) =

Π(p2)

1 − Π(p2)Γ2,1r(p2)

=

−i
p2e¯p2 − M 4

,

f (¯p2)

(4.20)

3 ¯p2

2 as ¯p2 → ∞. For such an external momentum dependence,
where f (¯p2) grows as e
the dressed propagator is more strongly suppressed than the bare one. The ﬁniteness
of all higher-loop and higher-point diagrams became possible because the exponential
suppression in the dressed propagator, which is e− 3 ¯p2
in the UV, overcame the expo-
nential enhancement arising from the vertices. The 1-loop, N -point functions with
zero external momenta became UV-ﬁnite, and so did the 2-loop integrals for vanish-
ing external momenta. The basic reason is simple; even for the 1-loop diagrams, the
suppression coming from the propagators is stronger than the enhancements com-
ing from the vertices. This ensures two things - ﬁrst, it makes the loops ﬁnite and,
second, the UV growth of the ﬁnite diagrams with respect to the external momenta
becomes weaker in every subsequent loops. Thus, ﬁniteness of higher loops is ensured
recursively.

2

With this adequate information, we now concentrate on the scattering problem for
BGKM gravity. We can compute the s, t, u-channels, tree-level scattering diagram
p1p2 → p3p4, see Fig. 1, which is given by in the Euclidean space, as:

Let us again point out that s, t, u are all negative in Euclidean space and satisfy

s → −∞ since |T |2 diverges in that limit.

point function, see Fig. 3, with arbitrary external momenta, which is given by

4.1 Dressing the propagator and the vertices

Similar to the earlier cases, we have found that dressed propagator is more strongly
exponentially suppressed than the bare propagator. Since Π(p2)Γ2,1r(p2) grows with
large momenta, we have, for large p,

(cid:101)Π(p2) → Γ−1

, one can verify that the total
cross section σdressed corresponding to Tdressed blows up as s → −∞. We also observe
that the external momentum dependence of Tdressed is less divergent for large exter-
nal momenta as compared to the external momentum dependence of Ttree−level (or
T1−loop). Hence, the use of the dressed propagator ameliorates the external momen-
tum divergences of the scattering diagrams, but it is not suﬃcient by itself.

dressed

To see whether we can eliminate the external momentum divergences of the scat-
tering diagrams, we will dress the vertices by making renormalised vertex loop cor-
rections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-ends of the scattering diagrams,
see Fig. 7. Following exactly the same prescription as in section 3.2, we obtain the
relation

αn = βn = γn = αn−1 +

1
3

(βn−1 + γn−1) − 1
3

,

(4.37)

which is Eq. (3.23). Since α0 = 1 and β0 = γ0 = 0, we observe that the coeﬃcients
αn, βn and γn increase as n increases; thus, dressing the vertices by keeping the

28

propagators bare and making just vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the
left- and right-ends of the scattering diagrams cannot tame the external momentum
divergences of the scattering diagrams.

For that reason, and as an example, we will now dress the bare vertices at the left-
and right-ends of the scattering diagram whose scattering matrix element is Tdressed
by making both propagator and vertex loop corrections to the said vertices, see Fig. 8.
Following the same reasoning as in section 3.3, αn, βn and γn become negative for
n ≥ 4.

For n = 4, we have the following conclusions:

• As in section 3.3, the most divergent external momentum contribution of the

s-channel, see Fig. 9, goes as

e
which tends to 0 as s → −∞.

which, again, tends to 0 as s → −∞ for all values of θ.

2M 2 = e

(4.40)
which, again, tends to 0 as s → −∞ for all values of θ. Hence, for suﬃciently
large n (speciﬁcally, for n ≥ 4), there is no exponential divergence for the s-, t-
and u-channels as s → −∞. The external momentum divergences of Ttree−level,
T1−loop etc. would also be eliminated following this prescription at suﬃciently
high loop order.

,

We observe that, for suﬃciently large n, dressing the vertices by making both
propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices at the left- and right-
ends of the scattering diagrams makes the external momentum dependence of any
scattering diagram convergent in the UV. By considering renormalised propagator and
vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices, we can eliminate the external momentum
divergences appearing in scattering diagrams in the regime of large external momenta,
i.e., as s → −∞. In contrast, dressing the vertices by considering just vertex loop
corrections to the bare vertices is not suﬃcient. Thus, dressing the vertices by making
both propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices is essential to taming
the external momentum dependences of scattering diagrams in the UV and, as a
result, making the cross sections of those diagrams ﬁnite.

5 Conclusions

The aim of this paper has been to examine the external momentum dependence of
scattering diagrams in the context of inﬁnite-derivative ﬁeld theories and gravity. We
have found that for a ﬁnite-order higher-derivative scalar ﬁeld theory the cross section
of tree-level scattering diagrams blows up at large momenta. Even considering dressed
propagators and dressed vertices, by making propagator and vertex loop corrections to
the bare vertices of the scattering diagrams, is not suﬃcient to eliminate the external
momentum divergences. However, we have noticed that dressing the vertices indeed
softens the cross section a bit. Motivated by these results, we studied an inﬁnite-
derivative, non-local scalar ﬁeld theory with non-local interactions. In this setup, the
propagators are exponentially suppressed and the vertices are exponentially enhanced.

For such non-local interactions, we have found that the tree-level cross section
still blows up in the UV. Also, dressing the propagator is not suﬃcient to tame the
divergence. On the other hand, dressing the bare vertices at suﬃcient loop order
(when the loop order n satisﬁes n ≥ 4) can yield ﬁniteness of the cross section in the
UV. What leads to a ﬁnite cross section is the softening of the vertices. At higher
loop order, the dressed vertices lead to negative exponents, which eﬀectively softens
any high-energy scattering amplitude. As a result, the scattering cross section does
not blow up for large external momenta, which is encouraging as to the inﬁnite-
derivative theories of gravity under consideration We may speculate that for such
cases, scattering scalar wave packets with non-local interactions would not lead to
collapse and, subsequently, formation of black holes. This is indeed an interesting
result which can help us to understand the UV properties of gravity, if gravity itself
were treated non-locally in the UV.

This motivates us to study high-energy scattering diagrams in a scalar toy-model
inspired by the non-local, singularity-free theory of gravity introduced in Ref. [54].
In this case, we were able to demonstrate that dressing the vertices and the propaga-
tors indeed leads to a ﬁnite cross section for the scattering diagrams, which become
convergent in the ultraviolet. This gives rise to a very interesting possibility that
perhaps our recipe could be followed for pure gravity, as in the case of BGKM, to
show that such non-locality indeed softens the trans-Planckian scattering problem
and can avoid forming a black hole singularity. We believe that our results will have
consequences for understanding problems such as collapse of matter forming black
hole singularity and the cosmological singularity problem in a time-dependent setup.

A Deﬁnitions and Conventions in Euclidean Space

Let us deﬁne s = − (p1 + p2)2 = − (p3 + p4)2 = −E2

Moreover, t = − (p1 − p3)2 = − (p2 − p4)2 and u = − (p1 − p4)2 = − (p2 − p3)2. We
have that s, t, u are all negative in Euclidean space and satisfy s = u + t.
