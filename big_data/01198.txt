MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP

SCHEME

MARCO ANTEI AND MICHEL EMSALEM

Abstract. Given a relative faithfully Ô¨Çat pointed scheme over the spectrum
of a discrete valuation ring X ‚Üí S this paper is motivated by the study
of the natural morphism from the fundamental group scheme of the generic
Ô¨Åber XŒ∑ to the generic Ô¨Åber of the fundamental group scheme of X. Given
a torsor T ‚Üí XŒ∑ under an aÔ¨Éne group scheme G over the generic Ô¨Åber of
X, we address the question to Ô¨Ånd a model of this torsor over X, focusing
in particular on the case where G is Ô¨Ånite. We obtain partial answers to this
question, showing for instance that, when X is integral and regular of relative
dimension 1, such a model exists on some model of XŒ∑ obtained by performing
a Ô¨Ånite number of N¬¥eron blow-ups along a closed subset of the special Ô¨Åber of
X. In the Ô¨Årst part we show that the relative fundamental group scheme of
X has an interpretation as the Tannaka Galois group of a tannakian category
constructed starting from the universal torsor.

MARCO ANTEI AND MICHEL EMSALEM

1. Introduction

1.1. Aim and scope. Let S be a Dedekind scheme of dimension one and Œ∑ =
Spec(K) its generic point; let X be a scheme, f : X ‚Üí S a faithfully Ô¨Çat mor-
phism of Ô¨Ånite type and fŒ∑ : XŒ∑ ‚Üí Œ∑ its generic Ô¨Åber. Assume we are given a
Ô¨Ånite K-group scheme G and a G-torsor Y ‚Üí XŒ∑. So far the problem of extending
the G-torsor Y ‚Üí XŒ∑ has consisted in Ô¨Ånding a Ô¨Ånite and Ô¨Çat S-group scheme
G‚Ä≤ whose generic Ô¨Åbre is isomorphic to G and a G‚Ä≤-torsor T ‚Üí X whose generic
Ô¨Åbre is isomorphic to Y ‚Üí XŒ∑ as a G-torsor. Some solutions to this problem, from
Grothendieck‚Äôs Ô¨Årst ideas until nowadays, are known in some particular relevant
cases that we brieÔ¨Çy recall: Grothendieck proved that, possibly after extending
scalars, the problem has a solution when G is a constant Ô¨Ånite group, S is the spec-
trum of a complete discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue Ô¨Åeld
of positive characteristic p, with X proper and smooth over S with geometrically
connected Ô¨Åbers and p ‚à§ |G| ([10], Expos¬¥e X); when S is the spectrum of a discrete
valuation ring of residue characteristic p, X is a proper and smooth curve over S
then Raynaud suggested a solution, possibly after extending scalars, for |G| = p
([19], ¬ß3); when S is the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R of mixed char-
acteristic (0, p) Tossici provided a solution, possibly after extending scalars, for G
commutative when X is a regular scheme, faithfully Ô¨Çat over S, with some extra as-
sumptions on X and Y ([21], Corollary 4.2.8). Finally in [4], ¬ß3.2 and ¬ß3.3 the Ô¨Årst
author provided a solution for G commutative, when S is a connected Dedekind
scheme and f : X ‚Üí S is a smooth morphism satisfying additional assumptions
(in this last case it is not needed to extend scalars) and in [3] the case where G is
solvable is treated. However a general solution does not exist. Moreover we know
that it can even happen that G does not admit a Ô¨Ånite and Ô¨Çat model (see [15],
Appendix B, Proposition B.2 for the positive equal characteristic case or [20], ¬ß3.4
for the mixed characteristic case). What is always true is that G admits at least
an aÔ¨Éne, quasi-Ô¨Ånite (then of Ô¨Ånite type, according to our conventions, see ¬ß1.2),
Ô¨Çat R-group scheme model. Indeed G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup scheme
of some GLn,K ([22], ¬ß3.4) then it is suÔ¨Écient to consider its schematic closure in
GLn,S. In this paper we explain how to solve the problem of extending any G-torsor
when G is any algebraic group scheme over K up to a modiÔ¨Åcation of X. When
X is a relative curve this modiÔ¨Åcation is represented by a Ô¨Ånite number of N¬¥eron
blow-ups of X in a closed subscheme of the special Ô¨Åber of X. For more precise
statements we refer the reader to ¬ß3. The most interesting case is certainly the case
where G is Ô¨Ånite. If we were able to prove that every Ô¨Ånite and pointed torsor over
XŒ∑ admits a model over X then the natural morphism œï : œÄ(XŒ∑, xŒ∑) ‚Üí œÄqf (X, x)Œ∑
(which is always faithfully Ô¨Çat, [5, ¬ß7]) between the fundamental group scheme of
XŒ∑ to the generic Ô¨Åber of the quasi-Ô¨Ånite fundamental group scheme of X would be
an isomorphism. It is known that œï becomes an isomorphism when we restrict to
the abelianized fundamental group scheme (cf. [4]). Here we Ô¨Ånd a partial answer,
extending all Ô¨Ånite torsors, but instead of providing a model over X we provide
a model over some X ‚Ä≤ obtained slightly modifying X, as explained. In order to
approach the question from a diÔ¨Äerent point of view it would be of great interest
to have a tannakian description for œÄqf (X, x), œÄ(X, x) and their universal torsors
bX qf ‚Üí X and bX ‚Üí X. In [14] Mehta and Subramanian provided a Ô¨Årst construc-
tion which works only for schemes deÔ¨Åned over some non-noetherian Pr¬®ufer rings
In ¬ß2 we give a diÔ¨Äerent tannakian
whose function Ô¨Åeld is algebraically closed.

description simply choosing the category of vector bundles on X trivialized by the
universal torsor, whose existence is now known. An intrinsic description, indepen-
dent from the existence of the universal torsor, would be strongly appreciated.

1.2. Notations and conventions. Let S be any scheme, X a S-scheme, G a
(faithfully) Ô¨Çat, aÔ¨Éne1 S-group scheme and Y a S-scheme endowed with a right
action œÉ : Y √ó G ‚Üí Y . A S-morphism p : Y ‚Üí X is said to be a G-torsor if it is
faithfully Ô¨Çat, G-invariant and the canonical morphism (œÉ, prY ) : Y √óG ‚Üí Y √óX Y is
an isomorphism. Let H be a Ô¨Çat, aÔ¨Éne S-group scheme and q : Z ‚Üí X a H-torsor;
a morphism between two such torsors is a pair (Œ≤, Œ±) : (Z, H) ‚Üí (Y, G) where
Œ± : H ‚Üí G is a S-morphism of group schemes, and Œ≤ : Z ‚Üí Y is a X-morphism of
schemes such that the following diagram commutes

Z √ó H

Œ≤√óŒ±

Y √ó G

H-action

G-action

Z

/ Y

Œ≤

(thus Y is isomorphic to the contracted product Z √óH G through Œ±, cf. [7], III, ¬ß4,
3.2). In this case we say that Z precedes Y .

When S is irreducible, Œ∑ will denote its generic point and K its function Ô¨Åeld
k(Œ∑). Any S-scheme whose generic Ô¨Åber is isomorphic to some K-scheme TŒ∑ will
be called a model of TŒ∑. Any morphism which is generically an isomorphism will
be called a model map.

Throughout the whole paper a morphism of schemes f : Y ‚Üí X will be said to
be quasi-Ô¨Ånite if it is of Ô¨Ånite type and for every point x ‚àà X the Ô¨Åber Yx is a Ô¨Ånite
set. Let S be any scheme and G an aÔ¨Éne S-group scheme. Then we say that G
is a Ô¨Ånite (resp. quasi-Ô¨Ånite) S-group scheme if the structural morphism G ‚Üí S is
Ô¨Ånite (resp. quasi-Ô¨Ånite).

Let R be a commutative ring with unity and G an aÔ¨Éne and Ô¨Çat R-group scheme;
we denote by RepR,tf (G) the category of Ô¨Ånitely generated R-linear representations
of G and by Rep0
R,tf (G) the full subcategory of RepR,tf (G) whose objects are free
(as R-modules).

2. A tannakian construction

Throughout this section R will always be a discrete valuation ring, with uni-
formising element œÄ, with Ô¨Åeld of fractions K := F rac(R) and residue Ô¨Åeld k :=
R/œÄR. The generic and special points of Spec(R) will often be denoted by Œ∑ and s
respectively.

Lemma 2.1. Let X be a noetherian scheme over R, T = lim
Ti a projective
limit of X-schemes fi : Ti ‚Üí X aÔ¨Éne over X. We assume that for all i ‚àà I,
H 0(Ti, OTi ) = R. Then H 0(T, OT ) = R.

‚Üê‚àíi‚ààI

Proof. This follows from [13], III, Poposition 2.9.

1We do not need G to be aÔ¨Éne in order to deÔ¨Åne a G-torsor, but it is the only type we encounter

in this paper.

Lemma 2.2. Let j : T ‚Üí Spec(R) be a surjective faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism and
let us assume that the generic Ô¨Åber TŒ∑ of T is such that H 0(TŒ∑, OTŒ∑ ) = K. Then
H 0(T, OT ) = R.

Proof. We Ô¨Årst observe that either H 0(T, OT ) = R or H 0(T, OT ) = K. Indeed

R ‚äÇ H 0(T, OT ) ‚äÇ H 0(T, OT ) ‚äóR K ‚âÉ H 0(TŒ∑, OTŒ∑ ) = K,

the last isomorphism being a consequence of [13, III, Proposition 9.3], and it is not
diÔ¨Écult to check that a R-algebra containing R and contained in K is either R or K.
However if H 0(T, OT ) = K, then the canonical factorisation of f : T ‚Üí Spec(R)
into T ‚Üí Spec(OT (T )) ‚Üí Spec(R) would not be surjective.
(cid:3)

We apply these remarks to the theory of the (quasi-Ô¨Ånite) fundamental group

scheme and its universal torsor that we brieÔ¨Çy recall:

DeÔ¨Ånition 2.3. Let X ‚Üí S be a morphism of schemes endowed with a section
x ‚àà X(S). We say that X has a fundamental group scheme (resp. a quasi-Ô¨Ånite fun-
damental group scheme) if there exists a S-group scheme œÄ(X, x) (resp. œÄqf (X, x))
and a pointed œÄ(X, x)-torsor bX (resp. œÄqf (X, x)-torsor bX qf ) such that for any Ô¨Å-
nite (resp. quasi-Ô¨Ånite) torsor Y ‚Üí X over X, pointed over x, there is a unique
morphism of pointed torsors bX ‚Üí Y (resp. bX qf ‚Üí Y ).

In [5], ¬ß4,¬ß5.1 and ¬ß5.2 we proved the following existence theorems:

Theorem 2.4. Let S be a Dedekind scheme, X ‚Üí S a faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism
locally of Ô¨Ånite type and x ‚àà X(S) a section. Let us moreover assume that one of
the following assumptions is satisÔ¨Åed:

(1) for every s ‚àà S the Ô¨Åber Xs is reduced;
(2) for every z ‚àà X\XŒ∑ the local ring OX,z is integrally closed.

Then X has a fundamental group scheme.

Theorem 2.5. Let S be a Dedekind scheme, X ‚Üí S a faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism
locally of Ô¨Ånite type and x ‚àà X(S) a section. Let us moreover assume that X is
integral and normal and that for each s ‚àà S the Ô¨Åber Xs is normal and integral.
Then X has a quasi-Ô¨Ånite fundamental group scheme.

Notation 2.6. In order to simplify the exposition from now on we will only consider
the case where X satisÔ¨Åes the assumptions of Theorem 2.5. However the statements
proved for the universal œÄqf (X, x)-torsor will also hold for the universal œÄ(X, x)-
torsor and the proofs are exactly the same.

DeÔ¨Ånition 2.7. We say that a quasi-Ô¨Ånite G-torsor over X pointed over x is quasi-
Galois if the canonical morphism œÅ : œÄ(X, x)qf ‚Üí G is schematically dominant
(i.e. R[G] ‚Üí R[œÄ(X, x)qf ] is injective).
It will be furthermore called Galois, if
œÅ : œÄ(X, x)qf ‚Üí G is faithfully Ô¨Çat.

Lemma 2.8. Let us assume that H 0(X, OX ) = R. Let G be a quasi-Ô¨Ånite and
Ô¨Çat group scheme and T ‚Üí X a quasi-Galois G-torsor pointed over x. Then
H 0(T, OT ) = R.

Proof. It is suÔ¨Écient to notice that the generic Ô¨Åber TŒ∑ of T is Galois over XŒ∑
[16, Chapter 2, Proposition 3]). The
(cf.
conclusion follows by Lemma 2.2.
(cid:3)

[5, ¬ß7]), hence H 0(TŒ∑, OTŒ∑ ) = K (cf.

MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP SCHEME

Corollary 2.9. Let us assume that H 0(X, OX ) = R. Then H 0( bX qf , O bX qf ) = R.
Proof. First we observe that for any quasi-Ô¨Ånite and Ô¨Çat R-group scheme G, any
G-torsor over X pointed over x is preceded by a quasi-Galois torsor: it is suÔ¨Écient
to factor the canonical morphism œÄqf (X, x) ‚Üí G as œÄqf (X, x) ‚Üí G‚Ä≤ ‚Üí G where
œÄqf (X, x) ‚Üí G‚Ä≤ is a schematically dominant morphism and G‚Ä≤ ‚Üí G is a closed
immersion. Then the contracted product bX qf √óœÄqf (X,x) G‚Ä≤ gives the desired quasi-
Galois torsor. Hence the universal torsor is isomorphic to a projective limit of quasi-
Galois torsor and the conclusion follows using Lemma 2.8, and Lemma 2.1.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.10. Assumptions being as in Corollary 2.9, the universal œÄ(X, x)qf -
torsor bX qf ‚Üí X induces an equivalence of categories Rep0
R,tf (œÄqf (X, x)) ‚Üí T qf
where T qf denotes the category of vector bundles on X trivialized by bX qf ‚Üí X.

Let Œ∏ : X ‚Üí Spec(R) denote the structural morphism and let j : T ‚Üí X be any
G-torsor for some aÔ¨Éne and Ô¨Çat R-group scheme G, then we denote by G ‚àí V ectT
the category of G-sheaves over T whose objects are locally free as OT -modules; it
is known that the functor j‚àó : V ectX ‚Üí G ‚àí V ectT is an equivalence of categories
and we denote by œÅ : G ‚àí V ectT ‚Üí V ectX a quasi-inverse. As usual, we naturally
associate to j : T ‚Üí X the functor FT : Rep0
R,tf G ‚Üí T , where T denotes the
category of vector bundles on X trivialized by T ‚Üí X, given by œÅ ‚ó¶ (j‚àó ‚ó¶ Œ∏‚àó).
Thus Theorem 2.10 is a consequence of the following more general statement which
somehow generalizes an analog result for torsors over Ô¨Åelds (cf.
[16, Chapter II,
Proposition 3]):

Lemma 2.11. Let G ‚Üí Spec(R) be a Ô¨Çat aÔ¨Éne group scheme and j : T ‚Üí X
a G-torsor such that H 0(T, OT ) = R. The functor FT : Rep0
R,tf G ‚Üí T is an
equivalence of categories.

1 ‚äóRV2)G. Analogously if F1, F2 are two objects of G‚àíV ectT , then HomG‚àíV ecT (F1, F2) =

R,tf G. Then Hom(Rep0

Proof. First we observe that the functor FT is fully faithful if and only if (j‚àó ‚ó¶ Œ∏‚àó) is
faithfully Ô¨Çat: let V1, V2 be two objects of Rep0
R,tf G)(V1, V2) =
(V ‚à®
H 0(T, F ‚à®
Rep0

1 ‚äóOT F2)G. Thus FT is fully faithful if and only if, for any object W of

R,tf G, the natural map

(‚Ä†)

W G ‚Üí H 0(T, j‚àóŒ∏‚àó(W ))G

is an isomorphism. We have the following sequence of isomorphisms (by means of
the projection formula):

H 0(T, j‚àóŒ∏‚àó(W )) ‚âÉ H 0(Spec(R), (Œ∏‚ó¶j)‚àó(Œ∏‚ó¶j)‚àó(W )) ‚âÉ H 0(Spec(R), (Œ∏‚ó¶j)‚àóOT ‚äóRW ) ‚âÉ

‚âÉ H 0(Spec(R), (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóOT ) ‚äóR W ‚âÉ H 0(T, OT ) ‚äóR W

as representations of G, then (H 0(T, j‚àóŒ∏‚àó(W )))G ‚âÉ (H 0(T, OT ) ‚äóR W )G = W G
since we assumed H 0(T, OT ) = R, whence the desired isomorphism (‚Ä†). In order
to prove the essential surjectivity, we argue as follows: let us take a vector bundle
E on X trivialized by j : T ‚Üí X. That implies the existence of a Ô¨Ånitely generated
free R-module M such that E := j‚àóE ‚âÉ (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóM . Again applying the projection
formula we obtain

(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àó(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóM = (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóOT ‚äóR M = M.

6

MARCO ANTEI AND MICHEL EMSALEM

It follows that E ‚âÉ (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àó(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àó(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóM ‚âÉ (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àó(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóE ‚âÉ (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóH 0(T, E). We
now observe that the previous isomorphism (Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àó(Œ∏ ‚ó¶ j)‚àóE ‚Üí E is G-equivariant
and thus FT (H 0(T, E)) ‚âÉ E.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.12. Lemma 2.11 can be generalized further as follows:
let R be any
commutative and unitary ring, q : T ‚Üí Spec(R) a morphism of scheme such that
H 0(T, OT ) = R. Let moreover G be any Ô¨Çat and aÔ¨Éne R-group scheme, acting on
T and let F be any G-sheaf, trivial as a OT -module. Then H 0(T, F ) is a R-linear
representation of G and F ‚âÉ H 0(T, F ) ‚äóR OT as G-sheaves.

Remark 2.13. Notations being as in Lemma 2.11, the tannakian category C over
R (cf.
[11] for a modern and detailed overview) associated to T is the category
of those OX -modules whose pullback over T is isomorphic, as OT -module, to a
Ô¨Ånite direct sum of OT and OT /œÄn, where œÄ denotes a uniformizer of R and n
a natural integer; in this way T would coincide with the full subcategory C0 of
C of rigid objects of C, i.e. objects isomorphic to their double dual. It would be
very interesting and useful to have an inner description of the objects of T (or
equivalently of C) independent from the universal torsor.

3. Existence of a model

3.1. Quotients and N¬¥eron blow-ups. In this section we are going to recall some
results ensuring the existence of quotients of schemes under the action of some group
schemes, under certain assumptions. Those results are essentially contained in [10],
Expos¬¥e V, Th¬¥eor`eme 7.1 and [18], Th¬¥eor`eme 1, (iv), for the Ô¨Ånite case and [18],
Th¬¥eor`eme 1, (v) and [2], Th¬¥eor`eme 7, Appendice 1, for the quasi-Ô¨Åni case. The fact
that quotients (under the action of Ô¨Ånite type group schemes) commute with base
change is ensured by [10, Expos¬¥e IV, 3.4.3.1].

Theorem 3.1. Let T be a locally noetherian scheme, Z a T -scheme locally of Ô¨Ånite
type, H a Ô¨Çat T -group scheme acting on Z in such a way that Z √óT H ‚Üí Z √óT Z
is a closed immersion. Then if one of the following conditions is veriÔ¨Åed

(1) H ‚Üí T is Ô¨Ånite and Z ‚Üí T is quasi-projective,
(2) H ‚Üí T is quasi-Ô¨Ånite and Z ‚Üí T is quasi-Ô¨Ånite,

the sheaf (Z/H)f pqc is represented by a scheme Z/H. Moreover the canonical
morphism Z ‚Üí Z/H is faithfully Ô¨Çat and the natural morphism Z√óT H ‚Üí Z√óZ/H Z
is an isomorphism.

Theorem 3.2. Let T be any locally noetherian scheme, Z a T -scheme locally of
Ô¨Ånite type, H a Ô¨Çat T -group scheme acting on Z such that the natural morphism
Z √óT H ‚Üí Z √óT Z is a closed immersion. Then there exists a largest open U of
Z for which the sheaf (U/H)f pqc is represented by a scheme U/H. Moreover U
is dense in Z and contains the points of Z of codimension ‚â§ 1. Furthermore the
canonical morphisms U ‚Üí U/H is faithfully Ô¨Çat.

Proof. It has been Ô¨Årst stated in [18], Th¬¥eor`eme 1, i) and a proof is contained in
[2], Proposition 3.3.1. The last assertion is just [18], ¬ß4, Proposition 2.
(cid:3)

The conclusion is that, in both cases, Z ‚Üí Z/H and U ‚Üí U/H are H-torsors.

Corollary 3.3. Let S be a Dedekind scheme with function Ô¨Åeld K and X ‚Üí S a
faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism of Ô¨Ånite type. Let moreover G‚Ä≤ be an aÔ¨Éne and Ô¨Çat S-group
scheme, Z a faithfully Ô¨Çat S-scheme provided with a right G‚Ä≤-action œÉ : Z√óSG‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Z

MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP SCHEME

and g : Z ‚Üí X a G‚Ä≤-invariant (i.e. g ‚ó¶ œÉ = g ‚ó¶ prZ) S-morphism such that the
natural morphism Z √óS G‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Z √óX Z is a closed immersion inducing a G‚Ä≤
Œ∑-torsor
structure on ZŒ∑ over XŒ∑. Let U be the largest open of Z as in Theorem 3.2 such
that U/G‚Ä≤ is a scheme; then X ‚Ä≤ := U/G‚Ä≤ is faithfully Ô¨Çat and of Ô¨Ånite type over S
and the natural morphism Œª : X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X is a model map. In particular U ‚Üí X ‚Ä≤ is a
G‚Ä≤-torsor extending the G‚Ä≤

Œ∑-torsor ZŒ∑ ‚Üí XŒ∑.

Proof. By Theorem 3.2, U contains the points of Z of codimension2 ‚â§ 1 so in
particular it contains, for all closed points s ‚àà S, the generic points of the irreducible
components of Zs. As U is the largest open of Z such that U/G‚Ä≤ is a scheme, so in
particular it contains ZŒ∑. Thus U is surjective over S. Hence X ‚Ä≤ is surjective over S
too and it is S-Ô¨Çat and of Ô¨Ånite type because U has the same properties (inherited
by Z). Thus X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X gives rise to the desired model map. The last assertion is
clear.
(cid:3)

We now recall the deÔ¨Ånition of N¬¥eron blow-up. Unless stated otherwise, from

now till the end of section ¬ß3.1 we only consider the following situation:

Notation 3.4. We denote by S the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with
uniformising element œÄ and with fraction and residue Ô¨Åeld respectively denoted
by K and k. As usual Œ∑ and s will denote the generic and special point of S
respectively. Finally we denote by X a faithfully Ô¨Çat S-scheme of Ô¨Ånite type.

According to [6], ¬ß3.2 Proposition 1 or [2], II, 2.1.2 (A), the following statement

holds :

Proposition 3.5. Let S be the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with uni-
formising element œÄ. Let X be a faithfully Ô¨Çat S-scheme of Ô¨Ånite type and let C be
a closed subscheme of the special Ô¨Åber Xs of X and let I be the sheaf of ideals of
OX deÔ¨Åning C. Let X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X be the blow up of X at C and u : X C ‚Üí X denote its
restriction to the open subscheme of X ‚Ä≤ where I ¬∑ OX is generated by œÄ. Then:

(1) X C is a Ô¨Çat S-scheme, u is an aÔ¨Éne model map.
(2) For any Ô¨Çat S-scheme Z and for any S-morphism v : Z ‚Üí X such that
vk factors through C, there exists a unique S-morphism v‚Ä≤ : Z ‚Üí X C such
that v = u ‚ó¶ v‚Ä≤.

DeÔ¨Ånition 3.6. The morphism X C ‚Üí X (or simply X C ) as in Proposition 3.5
is called the N¬¥eron blow up of X at C and property 2 is often referred to as the
universal property of the N¬¥eron blow up.

3.2. Construction of a model. Given an algebraic G-torsor Y ‚Üí XŒ∑ we do not
know whether or not we can Ô¨Ånd a torsor over X, whose generic Ô¨Åber is isomorphic
to the given one. In ¬ß1.1 we have recalled the most important and recent results
that partially solve this problem when G is Ô¨Ånite; here we suggest a new approach
in a much wider context, including the case G of Ô¨Ånite type.

Theorem 3.7. Let S be the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with function
Ô¨Åeld K. Let X ‚Üí S be a faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism of Ô¨Ånite type with X a regular
and integral scheme of absolute dimension 2 endowed with a section x ‚àà X(S). Let
G be a Ô¨Ånite K-group and f : Y ‚Üí XŒ∑ a G-torsor pointed in y ‚àà YxŒ∑ (K), then
there exists an integral scheme X ‚Ä≤ faithfully Ô¨Çat and of Ô¨Ånite type over S, a model

map Œª : X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X and a G0-torsor f ‚Ä≤ : Y0 ‚Üí X ‚Ä≤ extending the given G-torsor Y for
some quasi-Ô¨Ånite and Ô¨Çat S-group scheme G0. Moreover X ‚Ä≤ can be obtained by X
after a Ô¨Ånite number of N¬¥eron blow-ups.

Theorem 3.8. Let S be the spectrum of a Henselian discrete valuation ring R with
function Ô¨Åeld K and with algebraically closed residue Ô¨Åeld. Let X ‚Üí S be a smooth
and surjective morphism with X a connected scheme. Let G be an aÔ¨Éne K-group
scheme of Ô¨Ånite type and f : Y ‚Üí XŒ∑ a G-torsor, then there exists, possibly after
extension of scalars, a connected scheme X ‚Ä≤ smooth and surjective over S, a model
map Œª : X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X and a G0-torsor f ‚Ä≤ : Y0 ‚Üí X ‚Ä≤ extending the given G-torsor Y for
some aÔ¨Éne Ô¨Ånite type and Ô¨Çat S-group scheme G0. If moreover G is Ô¨Ånite then
G0 is quasi-Ô¨Ånite and there exists an open sub-scheme W ‚äÜ X such that X\W
has codimension ‚â• 3 in X and such that X ‚Ä≤ can be obtained from W after a Ô¨Ånite
number of N¬¥eron blow-ups.

Before proceeding with the proofs of Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 we need some pre-

liminary results:

Lemma 3.9. Let S be a Dedekind scheme with function Ô¨Åeld K and X ‚Üí S a
faithfully Ô¨Çat morphism of Ô¨Ånite type with X regular and integral. For any vector
bundle V on XŒ∑ there exist a open subscheme X1 ‚äÜ X containing XŒ∑, where X\X1
has codimension ‚â• 3 in X, such that X1 is faithfully Ô¨Çat and of Ô¨Ånite type over S
and a vector bundle W on X1 such that W|XŒ∑ ‚âÉ V . If moreover dim(X) = 2 then
we can choose X1 = X.

Proof. Let us denote by j : XŒ∑ ‚Üí X the natural open immersion. First of all
we observe that there exists a coherent sheaf F on X such that j‚àó(F ) ‚âÉ V (cf.
for instance [13], II, ex. 5.15). Then F ‚à®‚à®, i.e. the double dual of F , is a coherent
reÔ¨Çexive sheaf. That j‚àó(F ‚à®‚à®) ‚âÉ V follows from the well known fact that j‚àó(F ‚à®‚à®) ‚âÉ
j‚àó(F )‚à®‚à® ‚âÉ V (see for instance the proof of [12], Proposition 1.8). If dim(X) = 2
then by [12], Corollary 1.4 we set W := F ‚à®‚à® which is a vector bundle and this is the
last assertion. As for the higher dimension case we know, again by [12], Corollary
1.4, that the subset C of points where F ‚à®‚à® is not locally free is a closed subset of
codimension ‚â• 3. We call X1 the complementary open subset of C in X to which
we give the induced scheme structure and we thus know that X1 contains XŒ∑ and
has nonempty intersection with Xs for any closed point s ‚àà S, whence the Ô¨Årst
assertion.
(cid:3)

Let T be any scheme;

following [9] (11.6) we associate to any locally free
sheaf V of rank n over T the sheaf IsomOT (O‚äïn
T , V ) which is a GLn,T -torsor
IsomOT (O‚äïn
T , V ) ‚Üí T , thus obtaining a bijective map between isomorphism classes
of locally free sheaves of rank n over T and isomorphism classes of GLn,T -torsors
over T . It is an exercise to prove that this construction base changes correctly (i.e. if
i : T ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí T is a morphism of schemes then i‚àó(IsomOT (O‚äïn
as GLn,T ‚Ä≤-torsors).

T , V )) ‚âÉ IsomOT ‚Ä≤ (O‚äïn

T ‚Ä≤ , i‚àó(V ))

Proof. of Theorem 3.7. We do the following construction: we take any closed
immersion œÅ : G ÷í‚Üí GLn,K for a suitable n (by [22], ¬ß3.4). The contracted product
Z := Y √óG GLn,K via œÅ is a GLn,K-torsor, then Z ‚âÉ IsomOXŒ∑ (On
, V ) for a
XŒ∑
suitable vector bundle V on XŒ∑ (for instance one can choose V := f‚àó(OY )) of rank
n. Let W be a vector bundle on X, as in Lemma 3.9, whose restriction to XŒ∑ is

isomorphic to V ; let Z ‚Ä≤ := IsomOX (On
X , W ) be the corresponding GLn,S-torsor
extending Z. Let us denote by Y and G the schematic closures of Y in Z ‚Ä≤ and G
in GLn,S respectively. We thus obtain the following diagrams

In general neither Y ‚Üí X nor Y ‚Üí S will be faithfully Ô¨Çat, however we can
modify the embedding G ÷í‚Üí GLn,K in order to obtain at least the surjectivity of
Y ‚Üí S (which will be thus faithfully Ô¨Çat). As we will see this will be suÔ¨Écient to
conclude. Let us now pull back the GLn,S-torsor Z ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X over x : Spec(R) ‚Üí X:
we obtain a trivial torsor, whence the existence of a section z‚Ä≤ ‚àà Z ‚Ä≤
x(S) whose
generic Ô¨Åber is z‚Ä≤
Œ∑ ‚àà ZxŒ∑ (K). Let us now call z ‚àà ZxŒ∑ (K) the image of y through
the closed embedding i : Y ÷í‚Üí Z constructed in diagram (1). In general, unless
we are extremely lucky, it will not coincide with zŒ∑, but, as they both live over xŒ∑,
there exists g ‚àà GLn,K(K) such that zŒ∑ = z ¬∑ g. Let us consider the isomorphism
of XŒ∑-schemes œïg : Z ‚Üí Z, z0 7‚Üí z0 ¬∑ g. The composition Œª := œïg ‚ó¶ i : Y ÷í‚Üí Z is
a closed immersion sending y to zŒ∑ and it turns out to be a morphism of torsors
i.e. commuting with the actions of G and GLn,K if we consider the new embedding
‚Ä≤
œÉ : G ÷í‚Üí GLn,K deÔ¨Åned as œÉ : g0 7‚Üí g‚àí1œÅ(g0)g. If we now consider Y
and G
respectively the closure of Œª : Y ÷í‚Üí Z in Z ‚Ä≤ and the closure of œÉ : G ‚Üí GLn,K in
GLn,R, then we observe that the natural morphism u : Y
is a
closed immersion: it follows from the commutative diagram

Proof. of the Theorem 3.8 We repeat the Ô¨Årst part of the proof of Theorem 3.7 in
order to obtain a morphism of torsors i : Y ÷í‚Üí Z, which is a closed immersion,
from the given G torsor to a GLn,K-torsor Z := IsomOXŒ∑ (On

XŒ∑
bundle V over XŒ∑. Now let X1 be as in Lemma 3.9 and W a vector bundle on X1

corresponding GLn,S-torsor extending Z. Let us denote by Y and G the schematic

As R is Henselian with algebraically closed residue Ô¨Åeld and as X1 ‚Üí S is
smooth and surjective there exists a section x1 ‚àà X1(S). If necessary after a Ô¨Ånite
extension of scalars K ÷í‚Üí K ‚Ä≤, YK ‚Ä≤ is pointed over x1,Œ∑; we can thus translate the
problem to R‚Ä≤, the Henselian ring obtained as the integral closure of R in K ‚Ä≤. In
order to ease notations we assume R = R‚Ä≤ from now on and we Ô¨Åx a point y ‚àà Yx1,Œ∑ .
Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.7 we can (and we actually do) assume that
i(y) = z1,Œ∑ ‚àà Zx1,Œ∑ (K) where z1 ‚àà Z1x1(R) is a R-section of Z1 ‚Üí S, which always
exists as we have seen before, hence Y ‚Üí S is faithfully Ô¨Çat. As in the proof of
¬ØY is a closed immersion. Using Corollary 3.3 there
Theorem 3.7, ¬ØY √óS ¬ØG ‚Üí ¬ØY √óX1
exists a largest open U of Z, faithfully Ô¨Çat over S, such that U ‚Üí U/G is a G-torsor
extending the given one. If we set X ‚Ä≤ := U/G, G0 := G and Y0 := U then we obtain
the desired result. If G is Ô¨Ånite the fact that U = Y (we apply to the previous
construction Theorem 3.1 instead of Corollary 3.3) implies the last assertion. (cid:3)
