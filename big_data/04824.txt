Three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant admits stationary black
holes that are not necessarily spherically symmetric. We propose boundary conditions for the near
horizon region of these black holes that lead to a surprisingly simple near horizon symmetry algebra
consisting of two aﬃne ˆu(1) current algebras. The symmetry algebra is essentially equivalent to the
Heisenberg algebra. The associated charges give a speciﬁc example of “soft hair” on the horizon,
as deﬁned by Hawking, Perry and Strominger. We show that soft hair does not contribute to
the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of Ba˜nados–Teitelboim–Zanelli black holes and “black ﬂower”
generalizations. From the near horizon perspective the conformal generators at asymptotic inﬁnity
appear as composite operators, which we interpret in the spirit of black hole complementarity.
Another remarkable feature of our boundary conditions is that they are singled out by requiring
that the whole spectrum is compatible with regularity at the horizon, regardless the value of the
global charges like mass or angular momentum. Finally, we address black hole microstates and
generalizations to cosmological horizons.

INTRODUCTION

The Bekenstein–Hawking (BH) entropy formula for

horizons of area A (GN is Newton’s constant)

SBH =

A
4GN

(1)

has been a source of inspiration for approaches to quan-
tum gravity and led to derivations of the entropy (1)
from a microstate counting [1–5]. Many of these ap-
proaches exploit either the simplicity of (near-)extremal
black holes, or the power of conformal symmetries, or
both. In generic situations, however, the horizon is non-
extremal, not always due to a black hole, and the near
horizon symmetries are not necessarily conformal.

In particular, in ﬂat space both the asymptotic symme-
tries [6–9] and [at least in three dimensions (3d)] the near
horizon symmetries [10, 11] are related with the Bondi–
van der Burg–Metzner–Sachs (BMS) algebra [6, 7]. The
importance of near-horizon BMS symmetries as a means
to understand black holes was recently highlighted in [12].
For related works see [13–20].

In this article we explore the spacetime geometry
around non-extremal horizons, which is universally ap-
proximated by the product of two-dimensional Rindler
space [21] with a compact Euclidean manifold. For sim-
plicity we shall work in 3d. In a co-rotating frame, the
near horizon metric in (ingoing) Eddington–Finkelstein
coordinates is given by

ds2 = −2ar dv2 + 2 dv dr + γ2 dϕ2 + · · ·

(2)

where the constant a is the Rindler acceleration. The
vanishing of the radial coordinate, r = 0, corresponds to
the location of the horizon, v is the advanced time and we
assume periodicity of the angular coordinate ϕ ∼ ϕ + 2π
so that the horizon is compact and has a total area given

by A = H dϕ γ. With no loss of generality we assume a

and γ to be positive, and the ellipsis refers to higher order
terms in the radial coordinate r or to rotation terms (we
shall be more explicit below).

One of our main goals is to explore the near horizon
behaviour of the gravitational ﬁeld. We shall propose
a new set of boundary conditions consistent with (2),
which leads to a very simple near horizon symmetry al-
gebra, the Heisenberg algebra. The associated charges
provide a particular manifestation of “soft hair” in the
sense of [12]. We show that the BH entropy is solely de-
termined by the zero-mode charges and does not receive
a contribution from the soft hair. We then establish how
the near horizon symmetries are linked to the ones at
inﬁnity [9, 22], and interpret our results in the spirit of
black hole complementarity [23–25]. We conclude with a
discussion of black hole microstates and generalizations
to cosmological horizons.

While some of the technical tools available to us are
speciﬁc to 3d, we believe that the general lessons drawn
from our derivations are dimension-independent and thus
shed new light on near horizon symmetries, soft hair,
microstate counting and black hole complementarity.

SOFT HAIRY BLACK HOLES

NEW BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

2

The behaviour of the gravitational ﬁeld in 3d general
relativity with negative cosmological constant Λ = −ℓ−2
around a non-extremal horizon can be described by a
near horizon metric in ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein co-
ordinates [ℓρ = r and f := 1 + ρ/(2aℓ)]

ds2 = −2aℓρf dv2 + 2ℓ dv dρ − 2ωa−1 dϕ dρ

+ 4ωρf dv dϕ +(cid:2)γ2 + 2ρ

aℓ f (γ2 − ω2)(cid:3) dϕ2

(3)

where ω and γ are arbitrary functions of ϕ. The metric
deviates to leading order from (2) in the gρϕ component,
but this can always be gauged away. It turns out, how-
ever, to be convenient keeping it as it is.

The line element (3) is an exact solution of Einstein’s
equations in 3d, since it has constant curvature. The
geometry possesses an event horizon located at ρ = 0.
Since it is not spherically symmetric, the solution gener-
ically describes a “black ﬂower” [26]. In the case of con-
stant ω and γ the solution (3) reduces to the Ba˜nados–
Teitelboim–Zanelli (BTZ) black hole [27, 28]. The metric
(3) does not obey Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions
[22], which motivates us to propose boundary conditions
that accommodate these solutions. This task becomes
remarkably simple in the Chern–Simons formulation.

EINSTEIN GRAVITY AS A CHERN–SIMONS

THEORY

While the metric formulation is closer to our physical
and geometric intuition, the reformulation of 3d Einstein
gravity as Chern–Simons theory is more powerful at a
technical level, which is why we shall use it. The bulk
action reads [29, 30]

ICS =

k

4π Z hA ∧ dA + 2

3 A ∧ A ∧ Ai .

(4)

The coupling constant is given by k = ℓ/(4GN ) and the
connection A decomposes into two sl(2, R) connections
A± with generators [Ln, Lm] = (n − m)Ln+m (n, m =
0, ±1) such that the bilinear form h, i is essentially
the standard one for each sl(2, R), hL1, L−1i = −1,
hL±1, L0i = 0, hL0, L0i = 1
2 , with additional minus signs
for A−.

The metric is determined from the connections A± as

gµν = ℓ2

2 (cid:10)(cid:0)A+

µ − A−

µ(cid:1)(cid:0)A+

ν − A−

ν (cid:1)(cid:11) .

(5)

Before we start we list the length dimensions we are us-
ing. The quantities v, γ, ω, ℓ, GN have length dimension
one, ρ, ϕ, k, A±, Ln are dimensionless and Rindler accel-
eration a has length dimension minus one.

Based on the near horizon behaviour of the metric,
one is naturally led to propose a new set of boundary
conditions, which in terms of the gauge ﬁelds reads

A± = b−1

± (cid:0) d+a
ℓζ± L1) · exp (± ρ

±(cid:1)b±
2 L−1). The auxiliary

(6)

where b± = exp (± 1
connection is given by

a

± = L0(cid:0)±J ± dϕ + ζ ± dv(cid:1)

(7)

with ℓJ ± := γ ± ω. The state-dependent functions J ±
and the (arbitrary but ﬁxed) chemical potentials ζ ± (see
e.g. [31, 32]) depend on ϕ and v in general.

The ﬁeld equations F = dA + A∧A = 0 hold exactly
and yield ∂vJ ± = ±ζ ±′, where prime denotes diﬀerenti-
ation with respect to ϕ.

For simplicity we assume constant chemical potentials.
Then the dynamical ﬁelds J ± become independent of the
advanced time v, and in the particular case of ζ ± = −a,
from (5) one recovers the spacetime metric (3).

CANONICAL GENERATORS

Our next step is to determine the canonical generators
Q[ǫ+, ǫ−] = Q+[ǫ+] − Q−[ǫ−] for arbitrary transforma-
tions ǫ± = ǫ±
i Li that preserve the boundary conditions
(6), (7). In the Regge–Teitelboim approach [33, 34] their
variation is

δQ±[ǫ±] = ∓

k

4π I dϕ η±δJ ±

(8)

with η± = ǫ±
0 . The most general transformations
δǫ± a± = dǫ± + [a±, ǫ±] = O(δa±) that preserve the
boundary conditions (7) imply δJ ± = ±η±′, with
∂vη± = 0. The additional components ǫ±
±1 generate triv-
ial gauge transformations, since they neither appear in
the transformation laws of the dynamical ﬁelds nor in
the variation of the global charges [35].

The global charges are obtained from functionally in-
tegrating (8) and turn out to be ﬁnite, integrable and
conserved in (advanced) time,

Q±[η±] = ∓

k

4π I dϕ η±(ϕ) J ±(ϕ) .

(9)

We highlight that the surface integrals in (9) do not
depend on the radial coordinate ρ, which implies that
the boundary analysis actually holds for any ﬁxed value
ρ = ρ0, regardless of whether ρ0 is close to the horizon or
inﬁnity. As explained below, this is the key in order to es-
tablish the relationship between near horizon symmetries
with the ones at inﬁnity.

NEAR HORIZON SYMMETRY ALGEBRA

The algebra of the global charges captures all bound-
ary condition preserving transformations modulo triv-
ial gauge transformations.
It is determined by the re-
lation δη2 Q[η1] = {Q[η1], Q[η2]}, where {, } denotes
Dirac brackets. Expanding in Fourier modes, J ±

[Xn, Xm] = [Pn, Pm] = [X0, Pn] = [P0, Xn] = 0 (11)
[Xn, Pm] = iδn,m if n 6= 0
(12)

where X0 and P0 are the two Casimirs and all other
Xn, Pn form canonical pairs. Eq. (12) is the Heisenberg
algebra. Thus, we have obtained a surprisingly simple
kinematical Hilbert space.

The near horizon symmetry algebra (10) [or equiva-

lently (11), (12)] is a key result of our work.

SOFT HAIR

The dynamics is governed by the Hamiltonian, whose
is deﬁned by H :=
corresponding surface integral
v = L0ζ ± [30]. For the particu-
Q[ǫ±|∂v ], with ǫ±|∂v = a±
lar choice ζ ± = −a the Hamiltonian is given by H = aP0,
which commutes with all canonical coordinates Xn, Pn,
so that we have trivial dynamics.

We consider now all vacuum descendants |ψ(q)i (la-

such that
Since H commutes with all gen-
the vacuum,

Eψ = hψ(q)|H|ψ(q)i = Evachψ(q)|ψ(q)i = Evac .

(14)

Choosing constant chemical potentials ζ ±, the gen-
eral solution of the ﬁeld equations with our boundary
conditions (6), (7) describes a stationary non spheri-
cally symmetric black hole that carries all of the pos-
sible left and right ˆu(1) charges. The simplest case is
the spherically symmetric one that corresponds to the
BTZ black hole, which only carries zero-mode charges,
J ±
0 = 1
2ℓ (r+ ± r−), where r± are the values of the sur-
face radius at outer/inner horizon [27, 28]. Generic soft
hairy black hole solutions can be obtained from the BTZ
black hole applying a generic “soft boost”, i.e., acting on
it with the full asymptotic symmetry group. Since soft
boost generators commute with the Hamiltonian they do
not change the energy. [65]

Soft hair charges do not contribute to the BH entropy,
which can be readily computed from the Chern–Simons
approach as in [36–39]. In fact, the entropy of a generic
soft hairy black hole is found to be given by

S = 2π(J +

0 + J −

0 ) =

4GN

(15)

This result naturally motivates performing a microstate
counting in the spirit of [1, 3].

LINKING NEAR HORIZON AND ASYMPTOTIC

SYMMETRIES

So far we have taken the perspective of a near horizon
observer. Here we translate our ﬁndings into the lan-
guage of an asymptotic observer. Since the global charges
(9) and their algebra (10) do not depend on the radial
coordinate, the same structure arises at inﬁnity. We clar-
ify below how our analysis manifests itself in terms of the
standard variables in the asymptotic region.

Our near horizon boundary conditions (6), (7) are writ-
ten such that the auxiliary connections a± are in diagonal
gauge, while the standard asymptotic analysis uses the
so-called highest weight gauge. Therefore, we transform
the gauge ﬁelds in (6), (7) to gauge ﬁelds ˆA in the highest
weight gauge. [66]

For a generic choice of an unspeciﬁed chemical poten-
tial µ the asymptotic form of the connection in the high-
est weight gauge is given by [32, 39]

ˆA = ˆb−1(cid:0) d+ˆa(cid:1)ˆb
ˆb = eρL0

ˆaϕ = L1 − 1
ˆat = µL1 − µ′L0 +(cid:0) 1

2 L L−1
2 µ′′ − 1

2 Lµ(cid:1) L−1

(16)

This implies that all descendants of the vacuum have
the same energy as the vacuum, i.e., they are “soft hair”
in the precise sense of being zero-energy excitations [12].
In the derivation above we can replace the vacuum state
|0i by any other state with the same conclusions.

where L and µ are arbitrary functions of t, ϕ.

The problem reduces to ﬁnd a gauge transforma-
tion generated by a group element g, such that ˆa =
g−1 (d+a) g, followed by renaming the advanced time co-
ordinate as v = t. We ﬁnd g = exp (xL1)·exp (− 1
2 J L−1),

where x = x(v, ϕ) fulﬁlls ∂vx − ζx = µ and x′ − J x = 1,
whose on-shell consistency implies

µ′ − J µ = −ζ .

(17)

Therefore, the asymptotic chemical potential µ depends
not only on the near horizon chemical potential ζ but
also on the near horizon charge J . The connections a
and ˆa are mapped to each other provided

L = 1

2 J 2 + J ′ .

(18)

We rephrase now the gravity result (18) algebraically.

If η stands for the parameter generating an arbi-
trary ˆu(1) transformation, δJ = η′, then Eq. (17) im-
plies that the corresponding parameter ε in the highest
weight gauge depends on the global charges and fulﬁlls
ε′ − J ε = −η. Hence, according to (18), the transforma-
tion law of L reads δL = 2Lε′ + L′ε − ε′′′. Expanding in
Fourier modes, Eq. (18) yields

kLn = Xp∈Z

Jn−pJp + iknJn .

(19)

This is a standard (twisted) Sugawara construction [40].
The generators Ln fulﬁll the Virasoro algebra with the
Brown-Henneaux central extension [22]

[Ln, Lm] = (n − m)Ln+m + 1

2 k n3 δn+m, 0 .

(20)

What we have shown above is that the asymptotic
symmetry algebra discovered in [22] is composite from
the near horizon perspective, which can be interpreted
as algebraic manifestation of black hole complementarity
[23–25], in the sense that the same physics is most natu-
rally described in very diﬀerent terms for an asymptotic
and a near horizon observer.

Even though the spin-2 currents fulﬁll the Virasoro
algebra (20), the corresponding global charges actually
span the ˆu(1) current algebra, which we show now ex-
plicitly. From the point of view of an observer at inﬁnity,
by virtue of Eqs. (17) and (18), the variation of the global
charges reads

δQ = −

k

4π I dϕ ε δL = −

k

4π I dϕ η δJ .

(21)

The global charges satisfy the near horizon symmetry al-
gebra (10). Thus, in spite of the fact that the asymptotic
conditions are written in the highest weight gauge, the
global charges do not fulﬁll the Virasoro algebra with the
Brown–Henneaux central extension, because the chemi-
cal potential µ instead of being ﬁxed at inﬁnity without
variation, for our boundary conditions fulﬁll Eq. (17).
In other words, in our case µ explicitly depends on the
global charges, while what remains ﬁxed at inﬁnity is our
chemical potential ζ.

4

spectrum is compatible with regularity of the ﬁelds, re-
gardless the value of the global charges. Indeed, if the
chemical potential ζ is assumed to be constant, and the
topology of the Euclidean manifold is that of a solid
torus, where the contractible cycle corresponds to Eu-
clidean time, regularity of the gauge ﬁeld means that its
holonomy around that cycle has to be trivial, implying

µµ′′ − 1

2 µ′ 2 − µ2L = −2π2/β2 ,

(22)

where β is the length of the thermal cycle. The regularity
condition (22) is solved automatically by virtue of the
equations that deﬁne our boundary conditions, (17) and
(18), provided ζ 2 = 4π2/β2. This last condition is easily
obtained from solving the regularity condition directly in
the diagonal gauge (7) and for ζ 2 = a2 amounts to the
Unruh temperature T = 1/β = a/(2π) [41]. Remarkably,
no global charges are involved in this relationship.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

One can use our near horizon algebra (10) to provide a
microstate counting of the entropy (15) [42]. Entropy can
alternatively be calculated from composite algebras like
the Virasoro algebra that we obtained in the last section.
Indeed, in terms of the Virasoro zero modes L±
0 using
(19) entropy (15) can be written in Cardy-form [43, 44] as

S = 2πqkL+

0 + 2πqkL−

n = 1

0 . Another way to perform a mi-
crostate counting through a composite algebra based on
our near horizon algebra (10) is to use the warped confor-
mal algebra found in [10] [their Eq. (9)], which consists of
a Virasoro and a ˆu(1) current algebra. Introducing gen-
erators Jn and Kn as J ±
2 (Jn ± Kn), the two algebras
are related non-linearly through Yn ∼ Pp∈Z Jn−pKp

and Tn = Jn. Using known results pertaining to two-
dimensional ﬁeld theories invariant under a single Vi-
rasoro and a ˆu(1) current algebra, called warped con-
formal ﬁeld theories [45], the cylinder partition func-
tion written as Z(β, θ) = Tr e−βH+iθJ , with H = Q∂v
and J = Q∂ϕ, enjoys the modular property Z(β, θ) =
Z(2πβ/θ, −4π2/θ), which allows to project the parti-
tion function on the ground state at small imaginary θ
[45], yielding an entropy S = 2πβ H vac/θ + i8π2 J vac/θ.
Assuming the vacuum state has no angular momentum,
J vac = 0, and using H = −∂ ln Z/∂β = 2πH vac/θ estab-
lishes

S = βH =

A
4GN

= SBH .

(23)

Interestingly, this result is independent from H vac. With
β = 2π/a and H = aP0 = 1
8πG , we recover
the BH entropy law (1). This provides a microscopic
explanation for the observation [10] that H is the product
of black hole entropy and temperature.

8πG H dϕ γ = A

One remarkable feature of our boundary conditions is
that they are singled out by requiring that the whole

Our results easily extend to the case of general rela-
tivity in 3d without cosmological constant (ℓ → ∞) [42].

In particular, the ﬂat limit of the metric (3) describes an
interesting class of “soft hairy cosmological spacetimes”
that contains the solutions discussed in [46]. Also in that
case we ﬁnd that soft hair charges do not contribute to
the entropy, which in turn agrees with the asymptotic
state counting in [47, 48]. The asymptotically ﬂat struc-
ture can be recovered in the limit along the lines of [49–
52]. We ﬁnd the near horizon symmetry algebra

The Hamiltonian again commutes with all the generators,
and therefore with all descendants of the vacuum. The
centrally-extended BMS currents [8, 9] are recovered as
composite operators constructed out from (24).

It is clear that the speciﬁcs of our construction, in-
cluding soft hair and black hole complementarity, cer-
tainly apply to diﬀerent 3d gravity theories whose ﬁeld
equations are solved for constant curvature spacetimes,
as it is the case of the massive gravity theories discussed
in [53–56], conformal gravity [50, 57, 58] and generaliza-
tions thereof, as well as for higher spin gravity in AdS
[32, 39, 59–61] or in ﬂat space [51, 52, 62, 63].
It will
be interesting to recover these physical features in four
dimensions [6, 7, 10, 12, 64].

[65] As explained below the softly boosted solution remains
regular. This is in a stark contrast with what occurs if we
apply the same procedure for Brown–Henneaux bound-
ary conditions [22]. This is because once acting on the
solution with a generic Virasoro generator, not only the
energy changes, but the regularity of the boosted solu-
tion is generically spoiled. Indeed, the additional Vira-
soro global charges of the boosted solution cannot be
regarded as soft hair, because they do not commute with
the Hamiltonian.

[66] To reduce clutter we discuss only one chiral part of the

connections, A+ and ˆA+, and drop the superscript +.
