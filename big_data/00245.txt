We demonstrate ampliﬁcation (and attenuation) of a probe signal by a driven two-level quantum system in the
Landau-Zener regime. In the experiment, a superconducting qubit was strongly coupled to a microwave cavity,
the conventional arrangement of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Two different types of ﬂux qubits show a
similar result, lasing at the points where ampliﬁcation takes place. The experimental data are explained by the
interaction of the probe signal with Rabi-like oscillations. The latter are created by constructive interference
of Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) transitions during the driving period of the qubit. A detailed
description of the occurrence of these oscillations and a comparison of obtained data with both analytic and
numerical calculations are given.

Although the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem was extensively
studied already in the 30s of the last century, nowadays, new
phenomena are revealed as a result of dissipation [1], envi-
ronmental noise [2], as well as measurement back-action [3]
on the LZSM interference. It has been shown that interfer-
ometry can be very useful in resolving of both spectroscopic
[4] and dissipative environmental [10] information about an
investigated system. Although LZ tunneling increases the oc-
cupation probability of the excited state, population inversion
cannot be achieved for an isolated two-level system (TLS)
without relaxation, and coupling to a measurement device
(and/or the environment) should depopulate the excited state
even more. Fortunately, what at ﬁrst seems counter-intuitive,
a ”continuous measurement” of the two-level system by a de-
tector or an ”environment” can lead to a signiﬁcant excitation
in spite of the decay [3].

In this Letter, we report on experimental observa-
tion of LZSM interference patterns through the ampli-
ﬁcation/attenuation of a probe signal
(stimulated emis-
sion/absorption) as well as lasing (free emission) by a driven
two-level quantum system in circuit quantum electrody-
namics (cQED) [6, 7]. A qualitative analytical analysis,
which provides the observed contours of the LZSM interfer-
ence patterns, is corroborated by numerical simulations of a
multi-level qubit-resonator system based on adiabatic-impulse
model (AIM) Ref. [17]. The LZSM interference is described
in terms of ”Rabi-like” oscillations, reminiscent of Rabi os-
cillations in a strongly driven two-level system. Recently,
the resonant case, where the Rabi oscillations are adjusted by
driving to match a weak (probe) signal frequency, was exten-
sively studied [11–15]. Similar to the presented experiments,
ampliﬁcation/attenuation of the microwave quantum signals
was observed. Thus, it is quite natural, similar to the use of

Rabi oscillations, to exploit Rabi-like oscillations for process-
ing of microwave quantum signals.

Our experiments were carried out on two different types
of superconducting ﬂux qubits. They are a ﬂux qubit based on
conventional Josephson junctions [14], and a phase-slip (QPS)
qubit, a novel qubit type, based on nanowires made from thin
ﬁlms of niobium nitride (NbN) [15]. The aluminium Joseph-
son junction ﬂux qubit is coupled to a niobium resonator with
resonance frequency ωr/2π ≈ 2.481 GHz, and quality factor
Q ≈ 9 000 for the fundamental half-wavelength mode. The
Josephson qubit tunnelling energy is ∆/h ≈12.2 GHz and
the persistent current is Ip ≈ 35 nA [16]. The quantum phase
slip qubit is a loop sized several microns and patterned from
a thin (about 2 nm thick) ﬁlm of NbN [16]. The persistent
current of the qubit is Ip = 30 nA and the tunnelling energy
∆/h = 6.12 GHz (other details can be found in supplementary
materials). The resonator fundamental frequency is ωr/2π ≈
2.3 GHz, however the measurements presented here are done
at the third mode at ω3/2π = 6.967 GHz, where the quality
factor is Q ≈ 500.

Emission and ampliﬁcation of

the transmitted signal
through the resonator with the qubits are studied under an ex-
ternal off-resonant drive in the LSZM regime. The experi-
mental results are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 for the Josephson
junction qubit and the QPS qubit, respectively. The transmis-
sion of the resonator, measured by a vector network analyzer
(VNA) in Fig. 1(a), and spectral voltage density emitted by
the resonator, measured by a power spectrum analyzer (PSA)
in Fig. 2(a), were characterized as a function of the alternating
drive amplitude Ad and the dc bias of the qubit ε0. The col-
ormaps reveal typical LZSM interference patterns with pecu-
liar maxima and minima. Further, we show that both hetero-
dyne (PSA) and homodyne (VNA) measurements reveal the

transmission coupled to the Josephson junction qubit as a function
of the qubit energy bias and the driving amplitude at frequency
ω/2π = 7.444 GHz. The transmission maxima were obtained by
a Lorentzian ﬁt of the transmission spectra measured. Ampliﬁcation
above a factor of 10 and signiﬁcant bandwidth narrowing is observed
for the ratio ∆/ω ≈ 1.6, which is closer to the slow-passage limit
(see main text). Here: ∆/h = 12.2 GHz and ωr/2π = 2.481 GHz.
(b) Spectral voltage density of the microwave radiation emitted by
the resonator. Solid and dotted black curves correspond to resonator
emission without driving and red dashed and dash-dotted curves cor-
respond to driving set at the working point marked by the cross in
Fig. 1(a). The resonance is shifted by 245 kHz when the driving is
ON. For better comparison the detuning δω is deﬁned as the distance
from the frequency of maximum for each case, driving ON and OFF.
For driving ON a clear increase of emission and bandwidth narrow-
ing is observed. To illustrate the ampliﬁcation, a weak probe signal
was applied (black dotted and dash-dotted curves). For driving ON,
the probe signal is ampliﬁed and the emission is locked at the probe
frequency.

same phenomena – ampliﬁcation and suppression of electro-
magnetic waves passing the resonator. For the red spots shown
in Fig. 1(a), corresponding to areas with high ampliﬁcation of
transmission, we have observed lasing effect - a considerable
bandwidth narrowing of the emitted microwaves from the res-
onator for the qubit driving ON by measuring the power spec-
tral density without probing signal (see the bandwidth of grey
and black solid Lorentzian curves in Fig. 1(b). To demon-
strate the ampliﬁcation in the power spectra measurement, we
apply an additional probing signal with frequency ωp close to
resonance. In the absence of driving, we observed a peak in
the power spectral density corresponding to the probing signal
added to the wide Lorentzian background (grey dashed curve).

FIG. 2: (color online). (a) Spectral voltage density emitted by the
resonator emission with the QPS qubit. LZSM lasing for small ra-
tio ∆/ω = 0.88, which corresponds to the fast-passage limit (see
main text). The position of the resonant ampliﬁcation and attenua-
tion points corresponds to the one- and two- photon Rabi oscillations,
R = ωd with k = 1, 2. Here: ∆/h = 6.12 GHz, ωr/2π ≈ 2.3
Ω(k)
GHz, ω = 3ωr = 6.967 GHz. (b) The squared amplitude of the
transmission through the resonator at ω3 (black triangles), which is
at FWHM 12.2 MHz without driving, determined by the photon de-
cay rate. When the driving at 16.3 GHz is ON, the transmitted signal
is ampliﬁed (red open dots) by a factor of two in power and becomes
narrower, reaching to 9.6 MHz. The measured emission in the same
conditions shows a high and narrow peak of 8.9 MHz width (gray
crosses). The lines correspond to Lorentzian ﬁts of the data.

For driving ON, the probe signal is ampliﬁed and the emission
is locked at frequency ωp visible as energy transfer (the area
between dashed and dash-dotted red line in Fig. 1(b)) to the
peak at ωp. Similarly, the QPS qubit was studied for ampliﬁ-
cation (by VNA) and emission (PSA). Fig. 2(a) demonstrates
transmission versus bias ε0 and driving. The emission is mea-
sured at ω3/2π = 6.967 GHz, while the driving frequency is
ωd/2π = 16.3 GHz. Although the pattern is different in col-
ors, it essentially demonstrates the same behavior. We observe
absorption (blue areas) and emissions as vertical red stripes,
corresponding to different multi-photon processes. Fig. 2 (b)
demonstrates the square amplitude of transmission through
the resonator at ω3 (black triangles), which is 12.2 MHz at
the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) without driving,
determined by the photon decay rate. When the driving at
16.3 GHz is ON, the transmitted signal is ampliﬁed (red open
dots) by a factor of two in power and the FWHM becomes
narrower, reaching to 9.6 MHz. The measured emission un-

The observed experimental results clearly demonstrate am-

a lasing effect at the LZSM interference maxima, since a nar-
rowing of the bandwidth was convincingly detected.

In theory, a driven tunable two-level system can be de-
scribed using Pauli matrices σx,z by the Hamiltonian H(t) =
− 1
2 (∆σx + ε(t)σz), with the constant term ∆ (tunnelling en-
ergy) and the time-dependent one ε(t) = ε0 + A sin ωt, where
A is the bias amplitude of the ﬁeld applied at frequency ω.
The respective Schr¨odinger equation can not be solved analyt-
ically in the general case, and thus a variety of theoretical tools
are applied to this ”simplest non-simple quantum problem”
[18]. Arguably, the most intuitive tool is the adiabatic-impulse
method (AIM); see Ref. [17] and references therein. We con-
sider here the adiabatic limit, following Ref. [17], where the
frequency ω is a small parameter (ω < ∆, A). When driven,
the system follows its eigenstates |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105), for ground and
of the Hamiltonian H are Eg,e(t) = ∓√
excited states, respectively. The corresponding eigenenergies
∆2 + ε2. The en-
ergy levels are depicted in Fig. 3(a). Close to the degeneracy
point, when ε(t) = 0, tunnelling between the two states is
possible. Note, that during one period of driving this point
is reached two times. The probability of tunnelling between
the states is PLZ = exp (−2πδ), known as the Landau-Zener
0 is the adia-
baticity parameter. One can distinguish two extreme regimes:
(i) the slow-passage limit (δ > 1 such that PLZ (cid:28) 1) and (ii)
the fast-passage limit (δ (cid:28) 1 such that 1 − PLZ (cid:28) 1).

ing the gamma function. Numerically, the probability ampli-
tudes from the Schr¨odinger equation may be found, as demon-
strated in the SI. They are plotted in Fig. 3 (b). Note, that
AIM predicts a step-like evolution. In the case of construc-
tive interference, during many driving periods, the upper level
occupation probability increases, up to a maximal value of
P+ = 1. In the long run, this displays an almost periodic be-
haviour, with slow oscillations reminiscent of the Rabi oscilla-
tions, which we will call Rabi-like oscillations. In the general
case (see SI), the AIM allows an analytical solution for the
frequency of these Rabi-like oscillations, which is given by

Rabi-like oscillations, resulting from constructive interference. The
upper-level occupation probability is plotted as a function of time for

the red and black curves were taken as: ε0 = 0; A/∆ = 15.75 and
15.71, ω/∆ ≈ 0.05, which corresponds to PLZ = 0.13 (cid:28) 1. The
Rabi-like oscillations are approximated by the dashed sinusoidal line
with frequency given by Ω (cid:28) ω, see Eq. (1) . Note that these Rabi-
like oscillations appear far from resonance, at ω (cid:28) ∆E/. Position
of the expected resonant interactions between the driven qubit and
the weak probe signal, as deﬁned by Eq. (2), are shown for the slow-
passage limit in (c) and the fast-passage limit in (d). The following
parameters were taken: ωp/2π = 2.5 GHz, ω = 3ωp, ∆/h = 12.2
GHz > ω/2π for (c) and ∆/h = 3GHz (cid:28) ω/2π for (d).

providing energy exchange between the qubit and the res-
onator.

With Eq. (2) the position of expected resonances between
the Rabi-like oscillations and the resonator mode can be pre-
dicted for a qubit coupled to a quantized resonator ﬁeld. These
we plot in Fig. 3 for the slow and fast-passage limit.

The shape of the interference fringes (see Fig. 3) qualita-
tively corresponds to the measured results for the standard
qubit (Fig. 1) and for the QPS qubit (Fig. 2). As we found for
our samples, they work in the slow-passage and in the fast-
passage limit, respectively. Note, this is only given by the
relation of the energy gap and driving frequency, and it is not
a unique feature of the chosen qubit types.

The LZSM theory, which does not include relaxation and
dephasing, does not provide population inversion. However,
certain analogy between driven systems exhibiting Rabi oscil-
lations (”resonant” case) and the Rabi-like oscillations (”off
resonant” case) can be demonstrated. Similar to the resonant
case, when the system’s energy levels are coupled by resonant
interaction (usually with small detuning δ = ω − ωq << ω),
the levels are coupled via LZ transitions, providing level split-

ting proportional to the frequency of the Rabi-like oscillations.
This means that the energy level structure is very similar for
both cases.
In order to analyze the ampliﬁcation and damping by making
use of the interaction picture, the expression for the coupling
between the resonator and the ﬂux qubit Hc = M IqIr (where
M is the mutual inductance between them and Iq and Ir the
respective currents in the qubit and the resonator) should be
transformed to Hc = M IpIr0σz
Ir0 is the zero point current amplitude of the resonator. For
both Rabi and Rabi-like oscillations, periodic change of the
population of the states is expressed as σzeiΩt. If Ω = ω, de-
pending on the sign of the Rabi or Rabi-like frequency, a time
average of Hc will deﬁne whether photons are created (a†) in
the cavity or absorbed (a) from the cavity. A possible sign
change is expected, when in a working point, the ground state
with N photons lays above the excited state with N − 1 pho-
tons. The detailed role of relaxation to the sign of the detuning
and the amplitude of the oscillations requires further analysis.
We demonstrate the applicability of the AIM method by
simulating the time evolution of a strongly driven qubit cou-
pled to the quantized photon ﬁeld of a resonator and calculat-
ing the average photon number ¯n in the resonator as a function
of the qubit energy bias and the driving amplitude in the ab-
sence of a probing signal.
The qubit-resonator system states are presented in the
qubit-photon basis |nq, n(cid:105). The eigenenergies of the system
with n photons are Eg,e + nωr. The energy levels of the
|nq, n(cid:105) eigenstates are depicted in Fig. 4(a). When driving the
system, LZ tunnelling occurs both between |g, n(cid:105) and |e, n(cid:105)
states at  = 0 and between |g, n(cid:105) and |e, k(cid:105) in the vicin-
ity of all multi-photon resonances Eg + nωr = Ee + kωr
where the levels exhibit avoided-level crossings Ωk,n shown
in Fig. 4(a) [19]. A similar system was recently studied in
Ref.[20]. In our model, for simplicity, only multi-photon in-
teractions between the states for n = k + 5 are considered.

For the set of parameters obtained from experiment on the
conventional Josephson junction qubit, the AIM simulation
shows LZSM interference patterns with high average photon
number areas, shown in Fig. 4(b). These patterns agree per-
fectly with the position of the resonances between the Rabi-
like oscillations and the resonator mode given by Eq. (2). To
achieve a better agreement between the numerical model and
the experiment on the Josephson junction qubit, coupling to
additional degrees of freedom is required, as the LZSM in-
terference pattern is strongly inﬂuenced by coupling to a bath
[2]. This can be carried out by the AIM with quantum jumps
that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system
and lead to ﬂuctuations and dissipation [21]. Such approach
could lead to a better understanding of the off-resonant driv-
ing of the qubit with strong dissipation which is important for
many ﬁelds as LZSM interferometry itself, laser science in
semiconductors [22], quantum diffusion [23, 24] etc.

In conclusion, we measured emission and transmission of a
weak signal through a resonator containing a strongly driven
qubit. The qubit experiences Rabi-like oscillations and when

given by Eq. (2). The obtained maximum number of photons in the
resonator is approximately 8 for system parameters: ωp/2π = 2.5

the frequency of these transitions matches the resonant fre-
quency of a resonator or/and of a weak-signal, the number of
photons in the cavity is increased or decreased. This is experi-
mentally observed as either emission (ampliﬁcation) or atten-
uation of the resonator fundamental-mode signal, which can
be referred to as lasing and cooling, respectively. The driven
qubit is described in terms of the LZSM interference, where
the sequential non-resonant non-adiabatic transitions result,
due to the interference, in the Rabi-like oscillations.

Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg-Majorana lasing in circuit QED: Supplemental material

1

AIM was shown to quantitatively well describe dynamics of the two-level quantum system in a broad parameter range [S1–
S5]. This method essentially describes the evolution of a system as the alteration of adiabatic stages of evolution with the
stroboscopic non-adiabatic transitions, also known as Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) transitions [S6], which was
recently studied for a number of quantum systems driven by the different periodical ﬁelds [S5, S7–S10]. In particular, it was
predicted that interference between multiple LZSM transitions can produce periodic oscillations of the level occupations. Quite
recently these oscillations have been observed in the time domain for a spin ensemble by making use of NV centres in diamond
[S4]. Since they are reminiscent of Rabi oscillations, they can be termed as LZSM-Rabi-like oscillations, however, for brevity,
we will call them Rabi-like oscillations.

Oscillations of the level occupation in the resonantly driven two-level quantum systems are a core of different spectroscopic
techniques. One interesting aspect, which was extensively studied recently, is the ampliﬁcation/attenuation of microwave quan-
tum signals [S11–S15]. The Rabi oscillations are adjusted by driving to match the weak (probe) signal frequency, ΩR ≈ ωp.
Then the resonant interaction between the two-level quantum system and the probe signal results in the energy exchange between
these two subsystems. Thus, it is quite natural, similar to the use of Rabi oscillations, to exploit the Rabi-like oscillations for a
processing of microwave quantum signals.

Experiment

Two Josephson junction qubits were fabricated in the central part of a resonator by conventional shadow evaporation technique.
The loop size of the qubits is 5 × 4.5 µm2 and each loop is interrupted by six Josephson junctions, of which the three smallest
are 0.2× 0.3 µm2, 0.2× 0.2 µm2 and 0.2× 0.3 µm2 determine the qubit dynamics. The additional Josephson junction provides
coupling between the qubits as well as a qubit resonator coupling. By applying a certain energy bias, one of the qubits can be set
to a localized state, while the second is in the vicinity of its degeneracy point. This way, we can measure the qubits separately.
The sample was thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator, providing a temperature of about 30
mK during the experiment. Both, the transmission and the spectral power density of the resonator at fundamental angular
eigenfrequency ωr were measured. The transmission was measured by a vector network analyser by a homodyne detection. The
input line was heavily ﬁltered by a set of thermally anchored attenuators at 3K plate (20dB) and at the mixing chamber (-33dB).
The output line was isolated by a cryogenic circulator which was placed between the sample and the self made SiGe cryogenic
ampliﬁer mounted at the 3K-plate. The qubit, biased by an external DC-magnetic ﬁeld, was strongly driven by a microwave
signal generator at frequency ω/2π through an additional coaxial line. The resonance frequency and the quality factor of the
resonator’s fundamental mode were determined from the transmission spectra of the coplanar waveguide resonator taken at a
weak probing. The scheme of our measurement setup is shown in Fig. S1.
Quantum phase slip qubit samples are fabricated using a process similar to Ref. [S16]: First, a NbN ﬁlm of thickness d ≈ 2−3
nm is deposited on a Si substrate by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. Proceeding with the uniform NbN ﬁlm, coplanar
resonator groundplanes as well as the transmission lines for connecting to the external microwave measurement circuit are
patterned in a ﬁrst round of electron beam lithography (EBL) and subsequently metallized in an electron beam evaporator. In a
second EBL step, the loops with constrictions as well as the resonator center line are patterned using a high resolution negative
resist. Reactive ion etching (RIE) in CF4 plasma is then used to transfer the pattern into the NbN ﬁlm.

Theory

In the main text we presented several results for the description of the driven two-level system by the adiabatic-impulse
method (AIM); for more details about this model see Ref. [S17] and references therein. In particular, in the fast-passage limit
this model gives correct expressions for the multi-photon Rabi oscillations in the system, where the correctness is conﬁrmed by
the agreement with the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). This appears as a wonder, since the fast-passage limit is, strictly
speaking, beyond the region of originally assumed validity of the AIM. Moreover, it happened that even in the opposite limit of
slow passage, similar, Rabi-like, oscillations appear. In this Supplementary information section we present in more details how
those results are derived.

mounted to a copper sample holder in Helmholtz geometry . The coils were fed by dc current source (CS) ﬁltered by a carbon powder ﬁlters
placed at 3K plate.

Multiphoton Rabi oscillations

Here we ﬁrst remind the results obtained for the Rabi oscillations in the RWA. First, the textbook example is the weakly-driven
two-level system, with A (cid:28) ∆, which is considered close to the resonance, where the frequency ω is near the characteristic
frequency of the two-level system ωq = ∆E/. With such assumptions the RWA describes Rabi oscillations [S18] with the
frequency

R = Ω2

ΩR0 =

(S1)

Another version of RWA can be developed when the small value is the adiabaticity parameter ∆2/(A · ω) (cid:28) 1, see e.g. in
[S1, S7, S19, S20]. This condition means that ∆ is small, then ∆E ≈ |ε0|. On the other hand, the above condition means that
the driving is strong and that the avoided region is passed fast. In this strong-driving fast-passage limit the system is resonantly
excited at kω (cid:39) ωq, which corresponds to the k-photon transitions with the frequency

From here, in particular, at weak driving, A/ω (cid:28) 1, only the transition with k = 1 is relevant, and with ω ≈ |ε0| ≈ ∆E
and with the asymptote J1(x) ≈ x/2 we obtain Eq. (S1). In the opposite limit of strong driving, A/ω (cid:29) 1, another asymptote

of the Bessel function is relevant: Jk(x) ≈(cid:113) 2

Rabi oscillations in AIM

This subsection and the next one are devoted to the results obtained in AIM in two limiting cases. To start with, we note that
the AIM was analyzed in many publications of which the review can be found in Ref. [S17]. There, and also in Ref. [S1], the
resonance conditions, the width of the resonances, and the frequency of the resulting oscillations were studied. The resonance
condition is written down in Eq. (S4).

In particular, the AIM predicts slow
oscillations of the qubit’s occupation probabilities, see Ref. [S17]. Here the time dependence is given by the factor sin2 nφ,
where n is the number of periods passed and φ is deﬁned by

3

cos φ = (1 − PLZ) cos ζ+ − PLZ cos ζ−,

where ζ± =(cid:101)ζ1±(cid:101)ζ2. If the frequency of these oscillations is smaller than the driving frequency, we can identify the factor sin2 nφ
2 t [S19]. During one driving period, the integer n
with the one corresponding to oscillations with frequency Ω, which is sin2 Ω
changes by unity and this corresponds to changing the time t by one period T = 2π/ω. With this we obtain the relation for the
π |φ|, which together with Eq. (S3) results in the equation (1). In addition, the amplitude of
coarse-grained oscillations: Ω = ω
the Rabi-like oscillations is maximal when the resonance condition for the driven qubit is fulﬁlled [S5, S17]:

(S3)

(1 − PLZ) sin ζ+ − PLZ sin ζ− = 0.

(S4)

So, we have the formula for resonances, Eq. (S4); these resonances can bear constructive or destructive character, and in the
former case the slow oscillations with the frequency Ω (cid:28) ω, as given by (1), can take place. This can be used for arbitrary
parameters, which is illustrated in Fig. 3. However, for deeper understanding it is worthwhile to consider several limiting cases.
Consider ﬁrst the strong-driving fast-passage limit, assuming δ (cid:28) 1, 1 − PLZ (cid:28) 1, and A (cid:29) ε0. Then one can obtain (see

also in Ref. [S17]): (cid:101)ϕS ≈ −π/4 and

(S5)
The approximated resonant condition (S4) gives ζ− ≈ kπ, which corresponds to the k-photon resonance condition, |ε0| ≈ kω
with positive integer k. This means that the resonances take place at ω ≈ ω(k) = |ε0| /k. Consider small deviations δω from
this value, ω = ω(k) + δω/k. Then after some trigonometrical derivations, we obtain the expression for φ. Next we can calculate
the upper diabatic level occupation probability, deﬁned by the equation from Ref. [S5, S17, S19]:

Thus, in this limit we obtain the multiphoton Rabi oscillations; these were analyzed in detail in Refs. [S1, S20, S21]. We note
that Eq. (S7) is in remarkable agreement with the multi-photon Rabi oscillations described by RWA, Eq. (S2). To emphasize
this accord, in this case we denoted Ω ≡ ΩR.

Similarly to the above, one can consider other limiting cases. Here we consider the limit of slow and strong driving with

δ > 1, PLZ (cid:28) 1, and A (cid:29) ∆, assuming in addition ε0 = 0. Then we obtain [S17]: (cid:101)ϕS ≈ −π/4, and

The resonance condition (S4) gives Aω = π

FIG. S2: (color online). The upper-level occupation probability P+(t) as a function of time for non-zero bias. Parameters are the following:
A/∆ = 15.75, ω/∆ = 0.05, ε0 = 5.1 and 5.17 for the blue and red curve respectively.

The constructive interference for m = 2k + 1 results in the Rabi-like oscillations; for illustration see Fig. 3.

Consider the frequency in the vicinity of the constructive resonance: ω = ω(k) + δω/m, where it is slightly shifted from
ω(k) = 2A/πm. Developing in δω, we obtain an expression for φ and then from (S9) we get the coarse-grained oscillations,
described by the upper-level occupation probability P+(t), its average value P and frequency Ω:

P+(t) = P (1 − cos Ωt), P =

This means that at δω = 0 the oscillations are maximal with the frequency deﬁned by the LZ transition probability, Ω0 ∝ √
PLZ,
which makes it much smaller than the driving frequency, Ω0 (cid:28) ω. These approximate formulas are demonstrated in Fig. 3(b) to
quantitatively good describe the exact solution.
We repeatedly emphasize that here we started from the adiabatic picture with small driving frequency ω (cid:46) ∆2/A (cid:28) ∆ and
with small probability of non-adiabatic transitions PLZ (cid:28) 1, and then in the AIM we obtained slow-frequency oscillations.
These oscillations were studied in Ref. [S4] both experimentally and numerically. Here we note that they are described by a
factor sin2 nφ ∼ sin2 Ω
2 t. Accordingly, in this picture such oscillations can be termed as LZSM-Rabi or Rabi-like oscillations.
In addition, other limiting cases can be considered. As another interesting situation, consider slow-passage strong-driving

regime, similar to above, but for non-zero bias ε0. Namely, we assume A (cid:29) ε0 (cid:29) ∆, and obtain: (cid:101)ϕS ≈ −π/2 and

Remarkably, admitting here ε0 = 0, we obtain the correct result, Eq. (S10), even though we assumed here ε0 (cid:29) ∆. Note also
the strong dependence of the Rabi-like frequency Ω0 on the bias ε0. This is demonstrated in Fig. S2; compare this with Fig. 3(b)
plotted for the same parameters but zero bias, ε0 = 0.
