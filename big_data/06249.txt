DISTRIBUTION OF GAPS OF EIGENANGLES OF

HECKE OPERATORS

SUDHIR PUJAHARI

Abstract. In 1931, Van der Corput showed that if for each pos-
itive integer s, the sequence xn+s − xn is uniformly distributed
(mod 1), then the sequence xn is uniformly distributed (mod 1).
The converse of above result is surprisingly not true. The distri-
bution of consecutive gaps of an equidistributed sequence has been
studied widely in literature. In this paper, we have studied the dis-
tribution of gaps of one or more equidistributed sequences. Under
certain conditions, we could study the distribution eﬀectively. As
applications we study the equidistribution of gaps between eigenan-
gles of Hecke operators acting on cusp forms of weight k and level
N , spaces of Hilbert modular forms of weight k = (k1, k2, . . . , kr)
and primitive Maass forms.

1. Introduction

The rich story of equidistribution started in the years 1909-1910 by
the work of P. Bohl [4], H. Weyl [29] and W. Sierpinski [22] where they
studied the distribution of the sequence {nα}, (for an irrational α) on
the unit circle. Here, {x} denotes the fractional part of x. Let us recall
that a sequence of real numbers {xn} lying in the interval [0, 1] ⊆ R
is said to be uniformly distributed or equidistributed with respect to
Lebesgue measure if for any interval [α, β] ⊆ [0, 1], we have

lim
V →∞

1
V

#{n ≤ V : xn ∈ [α, β]} = β − α.

This subject attracted great attention of mathematicians from all
branches of mathematics after Hermann Weyl related the study of
equidistribution to the study of exponential sums in his 1916 paper [30].
Our work is partly motivated by the following result of Van der Cor-
put (see [15], page no. 176): If for each positive integer s, the sequence
{xn+s − xn} is uniformly distributed (mod 1), then the sequence {xn}
is uniformly distributed (mod 1).

We ask the following question:

Question 1. Is the converse of Van der Corput’s result true?

In other words, if {xn} is uniformly distributed (mod 1), then is
it true that for any positive integer s, the sequence {xn+s − xn} is
uniformly distributed (mod 1)?
The answer to the above question is surprisingly no. In fact we will
produce an example of a uniformly distributed (mod 1) sequence such
that for any subsequence, {xn+1−xn} will not be uniformly distributed
(mod 1). For example, consider the well studied sequence {nα}, α is
irrational. Write the sequence as follows:

For a natural number N, deﬁne,

and write them as increasing order as follows:

Aα(N) = {{nα} : n ∈ N},

(1)

Aα(N) = {0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 ≤ · · · ≤ xN ≤ 1}.

In 1957, Steinhaus conjectured the following fact:
#{xi+1 − xi : 1 ≤ i ≤ N} ≤ 3,

where # denotes the cardinality of a set. There are several proofs of the
above conjecture available in literature, but the ﬁrst proof was given
by Vera S´os [23] and [24] in 1958. The above conjecture / theorem is
popularly known as “The three gap theorem”.

In 2002, Vˆajˆaitu and Zaharescu [28] investigated the following ques-

tion:

Question 2. Let Aα(N) be as deﬁned in (1). Erase as many elements
of Aα(N) as one likes. Then, how large is the cardinality of the con-
secutive diﬀerences of the resulting set?

More explicitly, they prove the following:

For any subset Ω of Aα(N), there are no more than (2+√2)√N distinct
consecutive diﬀerences, that is, if

then

B(Ω) = {xi+1 − xi : 1 ≤ i ≤ N, xi ∈ Ω}.

#B(Ω(N)) ≤ (2 + √2)√N .

In 2015, using additive combinatorics A. Balog, A.Granville and J.
Solymosi [1] improved the bound of above result [28] to 2√2N + 1 for
any ﬁnite subset of R/Z. In particular for our concerned sequence, they
proved that

#B(N) ≤ 2√2N + 1.

From the above result, we can conclude that for any subsequence say
{yn} = {y1, y2, y3, ...} of {xn} = {x1, x2, x3, ...}, the consecutive diﬀer-
ence {yi+1 − yi} is not uniformly distributed (mod 1).

In this paper we will show that, if a sequence is equidistributed
in [− 1
2] with respect to a probability measure say µ = F (x)dx (for
deﬁnition see Section 3), then the fractional parts of gaps of all elements
of the sequence will be equidistributed in [0, 1] with respect to the
measure F (x) ∗ F (x) dx, where ′∗′ is the convolution of the measures.
More explicitly, if we have two sequences say {xn}∞
n=1 and {ym}∞
m=1
such that they are equidistributed with respect to probability measures
µ1 = F1(x)dx and µ2 = F2(x)dx respectively in [− 1
2 , 1
2], then the se-
quence of fractional parts of gaps between elements of {xn} and {ym},
that is, {xn − ym}∞
n,m=1 (mod 1) is equidistributed in [0, 1] with respect
to F1(x) ∗ F2(x)dx. We are also able to predict quantitatively the rate
of convergence of the following:

lim
V →∞

1
V 2 #{1 ≤ m, n ≤ V : {xn − ym} mod 1 ∈ [α, β]},

n=1 and {ym}∞
where [α, β] is any subset of [0, 1], whenever {xn}∞
m=1
satisfy some conditions that have been described in Theorem 6. More
generally, we have similar results for r equidistributed sequences. These
results are stated in Section 2 as Theorem 3, 4 and 6. We have discussed
several applications of our results in Section 9.
Let S(N, k) be the space of all holomorphic cusp forms of weight k with
respect to Γ0(N). For any positive integer n, let Tn(N, k) be the nth
Hecke operator acting on S(N, k). Let s(N, k) denote the dimension of
the vector space S(N, k). For a positive integer n ≥ 1, let

{an,i,N , 1 ≤ i ≤ s(N, k)}

denote the eigenvalues of Tn, counted with multiplicity. For any pos-
itive integer n, let T ′
n be the normalized Hecke operator acting on
S(N, k), deﬁned as follows

SUDHIR PUJAHARI

Using results of Murty and Sinha [16], Murty and Srinivas [17] have

recently proved the following results

#{(i, j), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s(N, k) : θp,i,N ± θp,j,N = 0}

= O(cid:18)(s(N, k))2(cid:18) log p

log kN(cid:19)(cid:19) .

Note that taking k and N suﬃciently large, the above result gives a
little evidence towards the Maeda and Tsaknias conjectures. As appli-
cations of our theorems, we can get the measure with respect to which
the diﬀerences of eigenangles of Hecke operators are equidistributed
and as a special case, the above result of Murty and Srinivas. We
could also get an error term (see Section 9, Theorems 12, 14). We have
also discussed similar results for Hilbert modular forms (see Theorems
18, 21) and primitive Maass forms (see Theorems 24, 26). In the case
of Maass forms, we have assumed the Ramanujan bound.

2. Statement of results

Let us start with a result that predicts the Weyl limits of gaps of
equidistributed families. Deﬁnitions are provided in Sections 3 and
Section 4. Here after, for our convenience we will denote [x] as the
fractional part of x.
Theorem 3. Consider {X1n}∞
n=1 to be collec-
tion of r sequences of multisets in [0, 1] such that for i = 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
#Xin → ∞ as n → ∞. For every m ∈ Z, let cim, 1 ≤ i ≤ r denote the
mth Weyl limit of Xin respectively, that is ,

3. Equidistribution

Deﬁnition 7. A sequence of real numbers {xn} lying in the interval
[0, 1] is said to be uniformly distributed or equidistributed with respect
to Lebesgue measure if for any interval [α, β] ⊆ [0, 1], we have

lim
V →∞

1
V

#{n ≤ V : xn ∈ [α, β]} = β − α.

In the year 1916 Weyl [29] proved that the sequence {n2a}, where a
is irrational is equidistributed in the unit interval. In the same paper
he gave a revolutionary criterion for uniform distribution in terms of
exponential sums, which is known as Weyl’s criterion. Explicitly, it
says that, a sequence {xn} is uniformly distributed in the unit interval
if and only if for every m ∈ Z, m 6= 0,

cm := lim

e(mxn) = 0,

where e(t) = e2πit and the cm deﬁned above is called the mth Weyl
limit. For proof of the above theorem see [15], page no. 172.

4. Set equidistribution

Consider ﬁnite multisets An ⊆ [0, 1] with #An → ∞. The sequence
{An} is set-equidistributed with respect to a probability measure µ in
[0, 1] if for every [α, β] ⊆ [0, 1],

5. Fourier Analysis

According to our need, let us recall some facts from Fourier Analysis
in this section. The reader may refer [19] for detail study. For our
convenience, let us deﬁne:

e(x) := e2πix.

Let f be a periodic and integrable function of period 1 on R. The

Fourier series of f is given by

f (x) =

ˆf (n)e (nx) ,

∞Xn=−∞

where ˆf (n) are called the Fourier coeﬃcients, deﬁned as

ˆf (n) :=Z 1

0

f (x)e (−nx) , n ∈ Z.

Let fi, 1 ≤ i ≤ r be r integrable function on R of period 1. Deﬁne
the convolution of r periodic integrable functions of period 1 on R,
denoted as

f1 ∗ f2 ∗ · · · ∗ fr : R → C

8

as follows:

f1(y1)f2(y2) . . . fr(y−y1−y2−· · ·−yr−1)dyr−1dyr−2 . . . dy1.
Among the many interesting properties that convolution of periodic
integrable functions satisﬁes, the following property serves our purpose:

(6)

(f1 ∗ f2 ∗ · · · ∗ fr)∧(n) = ˆf1(n) ˆf2(n) . . . ˆfr(n).

In particular, for r = 2,

(f1 ∗ f2)∧(n) = ˆf1(n) ˆf2(n).

The following theorem can be concluded from the famous Riesz-Fischer
theorem (see [19], page no. 91):

Theorem 9. [Riesz-Fischer]
Let {an} be a sequence of real numbers. If
|an|2 < ∞,

∞Xn=−∞

then there exists a unique periodic square Lebesgue integrable function
f that is f ∈ L2[0, 1] such that

f (x) =

6. Beurling-Selberg polynomials

Let χI(x) be the characteristic function of the interval [a, b] ⊆ R.
For a positive integer M, deﬁne △M (x) to be the Fejer’s Kernel,
deﬁned as below:

△M (x) = X|n|<M(cid:18)1 − |n|

M(cid:19) e(nx) =

9. Applications

In this section we will give several applications of our Theorems.

For (i), let us assume the notations of last part of Section 1.

(i) Distribution of gaps of eigenangles of normalized Hecke
operators T ′
p acting on the space of cusp forms of level N and
weight k.

The recently proved Sato-Tate conjecture in a series of papers
by Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty, Harris, Shepherd-Barron and Tay-
lor [2], [6], [9] says that if f is a normalized Hecke eigenform, then the
family {ap,i,N , 1 ≤ i ≤ s(N, k)} is equidistributed in [−2, 2], as p → ∞
and (p, N) = 1 with respect to the Sato-Tate measure

where

dµ∞ = F (x)dx,

F (x) =

2π

√4 − x2.

In 1997, Serre [21] studied the “vertical” Sato-Tate conjecture by ﬁxing
a prime p and varying N and k. In particular, he proved the following
result: Let Nλ, kλ be positive integers such that kλ is even, Nλ + kλ →
∞ and p is a prime not dividing Nλ for any λ. Then the family of
eigenvalues,

Remark 11. In the same year 1997 Conrey, Duke and Farmer [7]
studied a “vertical” Sato-Tate conjecture by ﬁxing a prime p, N = 1
and varying k.

In 2009, Murty and Sinha [16] obtained the eﬀective version of above
result. Explicitly, they prove the following: Let p be a ﬁxed prime. Let
{(N, k)} be a sequence of pairs of positive integers such that k is even,

The following theorem can be deduced from the above theorem.

= O(cid:18)(s(N, k))r(cid:18) log p

log kN(cid:19)(cid:19) ,

where the implied constant is eﬀectively computable.

In the above theorem for r = 2, we have an interesting consequences.

Its worth mentioning as a theorem.
Theorem 15. For any α ∈ [0, 1],

#(cid:26)(i, j) :(cid:20)±θp,i,N ± θp,j,N

log kN(cid:19)(cid:19) .
(cid:19) = α(cid:27) ≤ #(cid:26)(i, j) :(cid:20)±θp,i,N ± θp,j,N

Since

Remark 16. In particular, if α = 0 we will get the result of Murty
and Srinivas [17]. In the above theorem if α = 0 and N = 1 it gives
evidence towards the famous Maeda conjecture and for N ≥ 1, it gives
evidence towards Tsaknias conjecture as mentioned in introduction.

(ii) Distribution of gaps of eigenangles of Hecke opera-
tors acting on the space of Hilbert modular forms of level N
and weight k = (k1, ..., kr), ki, 1 ≤ i ≤ r are even.
In this section, we will follow notations and presentation from [11].
Here we will apply our theorems to study the distribution of gaps of
eigenvalues of normalised Hecke operator T ′

forms and further to some GL2 automorphic representations, whose

a totally real number ﬁeld with degree d ≥ 2. Let σ1, σ2, ..., σr be the
embeddings of F in to R with valuations ∞1,∞2, ...,∞r respectively.
Let O be the ring of integers of F. For any integral ideal a deﬁne the
ideal norm of a as

Na := |O/a|.

For α ∈ O, deﬁne the absolute norm of α as
N(α) := N((α)).

Let πk be the discrete representation of GL2(R) of weight k (even pos-
itive integer) with trivial central character. Let k = (k1, k2, ..., kr) be
an r tuples of even integers with ki ≥ 4, i = 1, 2, ..., r. For any inte-

above mentioned αiv, i = 1, 2 are called Satake parameters. Using
Ramanujan conjecture see [3] and [18], we know that

λv(π) ∈ [−2, 2].

Let S = {w1, w2, ..., wl} be a set of non-archemedian valuations with
the corresponding prime ideal say qi attached to wi. Let ρwi be a super

(iii) Distribution of gaps between eigenangles of Hecke
operators acting on space of Maass forms.

Let H be the upper half plane in C. Consider Γ = SL2(Z).
The non Euclidean Laplace operator is given by

δx2 +

△ = −y2(cid:18) δ2

The operator △ is invariant under the action of SL2(Z) on H, where
the action of SL2(Z) on H deﬁned as follows:

For any z ∈ H and γ =(cid:18)a b

γz =

Deﬁnition 23. A smooth function f 6= 0 on H is called a Maass form
for the group Γ if
(i) For all γ ∈ Γ and all z ∈ H,

f (γz) = f (z);

(ii) f is an eigen function of above △ that is,

△f = λf,

(iii) There exists a positive integer N such that
f (z) ≪ yN, as y → ∞

We know that the Maass cusp forms span a subspace C(Γ/H) in
L2(Γ/H) and for any positive integer n, the Hecke operator Tn together
with the above deﬁned Laplacian △ forms a commutative family H of
Hermitian operators on L2(Γ/H) with respect to the inner product

we know :

vol(Γ/H)T 2 + O(T log T ).

The Ramanujan conjecture predicts that for any prime p,

|λj(p)| ≤ 2.

At present we are far from above bound. The best bound towards
Ramanujan’s conjecture for Maass forms is due to Kim and Sarnak
(see [12]), that is for any prime p,

|λj(p)| ≤ pθ + p−θ,

where θ = 7
However, in [20], Theorem 1.1 Sarnak showed that for a ﬁxed prime p,

and analogously in [14], Lemma 4.3 Lau and Wang showed that the
above number is

.

In particular, almost all eigenvalues λj(p) (in the sense of density in
j) lie in the interval [−2, 2]. Consider f is a primitive Maass form.
Assuming Ramanujan’s conjecture, write

λj(p) = 2 cos θp,j, θp,j ∈ [0, π]

The following result can be seen as a special case of Theorem 1.2 [20]
and Theorem 1, in [14]:
Let µp be the measure as deﬁned in (8). Then the family

is equidistributed with respect to the measure µp.

Now proceeding just like proof of Theorems 12 and 18 and choosing

M = c log p

log T , we have the required result. (cid:3)

As a consequence of above theorem, we have the following theorem

Theorem 26. For any α ∈ [0, 1],

#(cid:26)0 < tji ≤ T, 1 ≤ i ≤ r :(cid:18)±θj1(p) ± θj2(p) · · · ± θjr (p)

2π

= α(cid:19)(cid:27)

= O(cid:18)(Ω(T ))r(cid:18) log p

log T(cid:19)(cid:19) .

Remark 27. For r = 2, the above theorem gives similar result like
Theorem 14.
