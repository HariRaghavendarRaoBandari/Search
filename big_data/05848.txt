We evaluate the grand potential of a cluster of two molecular species, equivalent to its free energy
of formation from a binary vapour phase, using a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics technique
where guide particles, each tethered to a molecule by a harmonic force, move apart to disassemble
a cluster into its components. The mechanical work performed in an ensemble of trajectories is
analysed using the Jarzynski equality to obtain a free energy of disassembly, a contribution to the
cluster grand potential. We study clusters of sulphuric acid and water at 300 K, using a classical
interaction scheme, and contrast two modes of guided disassembly. In one, the cluster is broken apart
through simple pulling by the guide particles, but we ﬁnd the trajectories tend to be mechanically
irreversible. In the second approach, the guide motion and strength of tethering are modiﬁed in a
way that prises the cluster apart, a procedure that seems more reversible. We construct a surface
representing the cluster grand potential, and identify a critical cluster for droplet nucleation under
given vapour conditions. We compare the equilibrium populations of clusters with calculations
reported by Henschel et al.
[J. Phys. Chem. A 118, 2599 (2014)] based on optimised quantum
chemical structures.

INTRODUCTION

Discussions of the vapour phase often start with an
ideal gas approximation, but such a viewpoint entirely
ignores the existence of molecular clusters that form and
dissolve as a consequence of the weak interactions that
exist between the constituent particles. Were it not
for these ephemeral and often disordered structures, the
vapour would not easily be able to transform itself into
condensed phases when prepared at lower temperatures
or higher densities. The nucleation of such phases in
these circumstances is determined by the kinetics of the
growth and decay of molecular clusters, and considerable
eﬀorts over many years have been devoted to understand-
ing these processes [1–4].

Direct numerical simulation of molecular clustering in
a large computational cell, necessarily with the use of
empirical force ﬁelds, is increasingly being explored (e.g.
[5–10]), though the expense is often very high and the
application to complex species and realistic experimen-
tal conditions is limited. A more thermodynamic point
of view is that even though nucleation is a nonequilib-
rium process, the population kinetics can be framed in
terms of the equilibrium free energies of the molecular
clusters that participate in the sequence of growth and
decay events, together with timescales for collisions be-
tween clusters and monomers [11]. Various modelling
approaches have been used to compute cluster free en-
ergies for species present in the atmosphere, ranging
from highly detailed structural studies based on quan-
tum chemistry [12, 13], to semiempirical descriptions em-
ploying the continuum properties of the condensed phase
[14–16]. Accurate modelling of molecular clusters is a
particularly diﬃcult task, in view of their intrinsic insta-
bility and typical lack of clear structural features such as
crystalline order. Small clusters can be liquid-like and

descriptions made on the basis of their resemblance to
solids might be questionable.

Thermodynamic techniques that make no assumption
of solid-like character exist, and they have often been
employed in a Monte Carlo (MC) setting [17, 18], under
constraints introduced to deﬁne an equilibrium cluster
state [19]. Typically, MC methods involve comparisons
between ensembles of similar clusters, often diﬀering in
size by one molecule, for example. A sequence of such
comparisons allows us to characterise the thermodynamic
properties of an arbitrary cluster, although constructing
such a sequence can be laborious. Molecular dynamics
approaches have also been developed [20–22] where fewer,
or more natural limitations are placed upon the conﬁgu-
rational freedom available to a cluster.

Recently, a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD)
method has been developed that examines the inverse of
a realistic process of cluster formation in order to identify
its thermodynamic stability [23]. The approach employs
the Jarzynski equality [24], according to which the me-
chanical work performed on a system during a nonequi-
librium process can be related to a change in equilibrium
Helmholtz free energy. The method, denoted cluster dis-
assembly, can be regarded as an MD version of thermo-
dynamic integration [25] and it has some intuitively ap-
pealing features [23]. External forces are used to pull a
cluster apart into its constituent molecules in a controlled
or guided fashion. A variation, denoted cluster mitosis,
has also been developed where a cluster is separated into
two subclusters, again to characterise the change in free
energy associated with the process [26]. The methods
have been successfully tested against calculations of free
energies, obtained by other techniques, for model argon
and water clusters.

In this paper we turn our attention to the disassembly
of binary clusters. We determine what is often referred to

as the free energy of cluster formation, which controls the
equilibrium cluster populations in a given mixed molecu-
lar vapour. Technically, we compute the grand potential
of a cluster for a given temperature and chemical poten-
tials of the species. We study clusters of sulphuric acid
and water, since this mixture has received considerable
attention in connection with the formation of aerosols in
the atmosphere [27–29].

In Section II we develop the theory of binary cluster
disassembly and describe how the free energy change as-
sociated with such a process can be linked to equilibrium
cluster populations.
In Section III we discuss the MD
simulations and the Jarzynski analysis that allows us to
determine the free energy of disassembly. We explore two
modes of disassembly processing and show that a ‘pris-
ing’ technique, where molecules are gently eased out of
the cluster, has considerable advantages compared with
a more straightforward separation by steady pulling that
can give rise to mechanical ‘snapping’ or tearing of the
cluster. In Section IV we compare our equilibrium clus-
ter populations with calculations made by Henschel et
[13] on the basis of minimum energy structures ob-
al.
tained from quantum chemistry.
In Section V we give
our conclusions.

II. STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF TETHERED

BINARY CLUSTERS

initially placed at the origin.

The external forces used in the method of cluster dis-
assembly take the form of harmonic tethers that attach
each constituent molecule of the cluster to a dedicated
‘guide’ particle,
In the
molecular dynamics, the guides separate in a prescribed
manner and carry their tethered molecules along with
them. The mechanical work exerted by the guides on the
cluster may be related to a free energy change using the
Jarzynski equality. We therefore start the analysis of the
disassembly by considering the free energy of a binary
cluster in the presence of a weak set of harmonic teth-
ers. We relate this to the free energy of an untethered,
or free cluster, and then to the equilibrium population of
the cluster in a given vapour mixture.

term on the right hand side of Eq. (8) is a correction to
the entropy of the cluster brought about by the tethering,
while the remaining terms are corrections to the energy.

B. Grand potential and equilibrium cluster

densities

We now introduce the grand potential of a free (N, M )

cluster, deﬁned by

ΩNM (T, µ1, µ2) = FF (N, M ) − N µ1 − M µ2,

(9)
where µ1 and µ2 are the chemical potentials of the par-
ticle bath for the two species. The equilibrium densi-
ties of clusters in a binary vapour phase can be shown
[11] to be given by nNM = V −1 exp(−ΩNM /kBT ). We
could express nNM in terms of the density of a monomer
of either species 1 or 2, so that, for example, nNM =
n10 exp(−(ΩNM − Ω10)/kBT ) in terms of the grand po-
tential diﬀerence ΩNM − Ω10 = FF (N, M ) − FF (1, 0) −
(N − 1)µ1 − M µ2, but it is more straightforward to
proceed without introducing the grand potential of a
monomer.

Representing the particle bath as a mixture of ideal
gases with readily calculable chemical potentials, the
cluster grand potential is
ΩNM = FF (N, M ) − N kBT ln(Λ1n1) − M kBT ln(Λ2n2),
(10)
where we introduce bath monomer densities n1 = n10 and
n2 = n01, and where Λs = [h2/(2πmskBT )]3/2 for s =
1, 2. Next, we consider the free energy diﬀerence ∆FD =
Ff − FT between the disassembled, but still tethered,
constituent particles and the tethered cluster. Ff is the
combined free energy of N harmonic oscillators of species
1 and M harmonic oscillators of species 2, which can be
written as:

Ff = −3kBT

where ωf s = (κf /ms)1/2 is the oscillator frequency of

the free energy of disassembly that we extract is actually
∆FMD = Ff − F dist

indistinguishable particles are related through Z dist

is a volume representing the freedom of motion of each
particle about its guide after disassembly. The ﬁnal
tether strengths are taken to be the same for both species,
and the mass dependent initial tether strengths κi1 and
κi2 have been inserted into the last two terms.

When M = 0, the expressions reduce to those pre-
viously derived for the single species case [23]. We
ﬁnd that the grand potential, correctly, has no depen-
dence on  and the equilibrium cluster density nNM =
exp(−(ΩNM + kBT ln V )/kBT ) does not depend on the
system volume V . Note that the equilibrium cluster den-
sities can be expressed in terms of the chemical potential
of a saturated vapour mixture if so desired, which is the
traditional way to proceed in nucleation theory, but here
we avoid such a representation and consider their depen-
dence on the monomer densities n1 and n2 rather than
the saturated densities.

The analysis of binary clusters could easily be extended
to clusters of an arbitrary number of species, if such sys-
tems are of interest.
In the next section we turn our
attention to determining the free energy of disassembly
∆FMD using MD simulation and the Jarzynski equality.

III. DETERMINING THE FREE ENERGY OF

DISASSEMBLY OF BINARY CLUSTERS

A. Simulation details and data analysis using the

Jarzynski equality

We employ a method for cluster disassembly based
upon that developed in earlier work [23]. We study clus-
ters of sulphuric acid and water, ranging in size from
dimers up to a cluster of twelve molecules. Each molecule
is harmonically tethered, initially weakly, to one of a set
of guide particles located at the origin. The tethering
force is applied to the heaviest atom in each molecule,
namely the sulphur in sulphuric acid and the oxygen in
water. A preparatory MD run of 10.5 ns duration is car-
ried out under N V T conditions in which the system is
allowed to equilibrate at 300 K in the presence of teth-
ering and intermolecular interactions. For the sulphuric
acid we used a set of classical interaction potentials devel-
oped by Loukonen et al. [30] based on a series of quantum
chemistry calculations, and the water was described by
the SPC/E-F extended simple point charge model [31].
An ensemble of 1000 equilibrium conﬁgurations was
selected at intervals of 0.01 ns from the equilibrated tra-
jectory, rejecting a very few where a water molecule had
temporarily become detached from the cluster. A further
set of simulations was then carried out, in which the equi-
librated clusters were disassembled through programmed
motion of the guide particles along with variation in the
strength of the harmonic tethers. Such a trajectory over
a time interval τ provides a work of disassembly given by

We employ the Jarzynski equality to relate the work
to the shift in free energy brought about by the change
in Hamiltonian associated with evolution from the ini-
tial to the ﬁnal state of the system. This relationship
is ∆FMD = −kBT ln(cid:104)exp(−W/kBT )(cid:105) where the angled
brackets represent an average over the ensemble of dis-
assembly trajectories [24]. In principle, the free energy

B. Optimising the disassembly protocol

5

We considered two modes of cluster disassembly, and
implemented each for a range of separation times to ex-
amine the convergence of the free energy of disassembly.
We ﬁrst carried out a simple pulling protocol in which the
guide particles separate at a constant speed for the dura-
tion of the simulation. The tethers start to tighten after
20% of the total separation time and reach their maxi-
mum strength at 80%, in a fashion that was successfully
employed in the disassembly of argon clusters [23]. The
radius of the sphere on which all but one of the guide
particles are ﬁnally distributed is 25 Å, and the ultimate
value of the tether strength is 0.60 kJ mol-1Å-2. The ﬁ-
nal guide particle separation was such that the tethered
molecules did not interact signiﬁcantly with one another
and the mean work performed during the separation had
saturated.

However it became apparent that simple pulling typi-
cally disassembled a cluster through a sequence of abrupt
‘snapping’ events. Molecules showed a reluctance to sep-
arate from the cluster, indicated by an increase in the
tether length as its guide particle moved away. This is
illustrated in the left hand image in Figure 1. When
the force on the molecule was strong enough to remove
it from the cluster, the guide particle had moved so far
away that the extracted molecule, after a short relax-
ation period characteristic of the thermostat, had little
further interaction with the cluster. Mechanically, these
extractions were typically irreversible, which also implied
a thermodynamic irreversibility, in the sense that a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the exerted work was converted into
heat and passed to the heat bath. The contrast with ar-
gon cluster separation in earlier work [23] was brought
about by the stronger intermolecular interactions in the
present system.

Consequently, a second protocol that we call ‘prising’
was developed to overcome these problems. It consists of
the following stages, where τ is the separation time:

• t ≤ 0.1 τ: Motion of the guide particles to a dis-
tance of 7.5 Å from the origin, at constant initial
tether strength.

• 0.1 τ < t ≤ 0.6 τ: Guide particles are held station-
ary, while tethers tighten to κf = 3.80 kJ mol-1Å-2.
• 0.6 τ < t: Separation of the guide particles to ﬁnal
positions on a sphere of radius 10.5 Å, at constant
tether strength.

The motivation for this procedure is that if the guide re-
mains in position as the tethers tighten, a molecule can
be separated from the cluster but remains close enough to
allow interaction and also re-attachment. The image on
the right hand side of Figure 1 illustrates a typical con-
ﬁguration from the middle stage in the prising sequence.
Once the tethers are fully tightened and the molecules
prised or eased out of the cluster, having explored a vari-
ety of ways of doing so, the guides resume their outward

Figure 1.
Illustrations of intermediate stages in the disas-
sembly of an NW = 4, NA = 4 cluster of sulphuric acid
and water.
In the image on the left, representing the sim-
ple pulling scheme, the tethers between the guide particles
(large spheres) and the molecules are signiﬁcantly stretched,
while on the right, taken from a prising simulation, molecules
are eased out of the cluster by guides situated at close range
with increasing tether strength. Movies of these disassembly
trajectories are provided in the supplemental material.

change extracted in this way should not depend on the
protocol of disassembly, but in practice there can be a
remnant dependence arising from limited statistical cov-
erage of the range of trajectories, and we shall consider
examples of such dependence in Section III B.

Simulations were performed using a version of the
DL_POLY molecular dynamics package [32], modiﬁed
to implement the time dependent harmonic tethering po-
tentials. The molecules, but not the guides, were coupled
to a Langevin thermostat with a friction coeﬃcient of
0.1 ps-1. We carried out the disassembly procedure on
a set of 46 clusters at 300 K, with the number of wa-
ter molecules, NW , and the number of sulphuric acid
molecules, NA, ranging from 0 to 6, excluding the cases
of a monomer of either species (these labels correspond
to N and M, respectively, in the previous expressions).
During the simulation, one of the guide particles remains
at the origin, while all others are distributed uniformly
on a sphere [33] of time dependent radius appropriate to
the disassembly protocol. The timestep employed in all
cases was 1 fs.

The initial oscillator frequencies for each species are
required to be the same, implying mass dependent ini-
tial tether strengths satisfying κiW /κiA = mW /mA. We
employ a reference initial tether strength ¯κi of 0.09 kJ
mol-1Å-2. This is small enough that the elevation in
energy for a molecule at the edge of the cluster is less
than kBT [23], and slight variations have been shown
elsewhere [26] to have little eﬀect on the extracted clus-
ter free energy. We deﬁne κiW = 2¯κimW /MW A and
κiA = 2¯κimA/MW A, where MW A = mW + mA. Ex-
amples of cluster conﬁgurations during disassembly, to-
gether with their guide particles, are shown in Figure 1.

ulation time required for convergence of the free energy
of disassembly ∆FMD when using the prising protocol.
Note that the ﬁnal tether strength in the prising proto-
col is higher than for simple pulling, so the converged
free energy changes are not expected to be the same for
the two approaches. The most important feature of Fig-
ure 4 is that converged values of ∆FMD are obtained
for shorter simulations using the prising technique. We
present grand potentials of cluster formation in the next
section based on a prising separation time of 15 ns, al-
though shorter times could be used without signiﬁcant
loss of accuracy.

IV. COMPARISON WITH HARMONIC

QUANTUM CHEMICAL APPROACH

order to evaluate the integrals (cid:82) ρs

We now combine the theoretical development given in
Section II (speciﬁcally Eq. (14)) with the numerical eval-
uations of the free energy of disassembly discussed in
Section III. We also require single particle radial density
NM of a free cluster about its centre of mass, in
proﬁles ρs
s in Eq.
(14). As an approximation, we computed these numer-
ically using the initial conﬁgurations of clusters in the
presence of weak tethers prior to disassembly.

Figure 2. The evolution of tether lengths, deﬁned as the dis-
tance between the tethered atom and its associated guide, for
the two disassembly schemes. The cluster consists of NW = 4,
NA = 2 molecules and is separated over a time of 5 ns. Note

cluster towards their guides in the simple pulling scheme, for
example at t ≈ 3.6 ns. The data have been smoothed using a

motion, although we found that little further work was
performed, on average, in the third stage: the molecules
had by then been suﬃciently separated (in contrast to
the 25 Å employed in the simple separation scheme with
much weaker tethering). The ﬁrm but more reversible
removal of the molecules from the cluster would be ex-
pected to lead to lower variance in the work of disassem-
bly.

The diﬀerence between the simple pulling and the pris-
ing protocols is illustrated in Figure 2 for the disassem-
bly of a cluster of four waters and two sulphuric acid
molecules over a period of 5 ns. The lengths of a set of
tethers, deﬁned as the distance between the guide and the
atom to which it is attached, smoothed using a Gaussian
ﬁlter of width 0.15 ns to remove some of the noise, are
shown evolving in time for both protocols. The snapping
behaviour in the simple pulling protocol is evident in the
form of an increasing extension of the tethers followed by
a rapid decrease. For the prising case, the there is more
hopping of molecules between the guide and the cluster,
and the general shortening of the tether length with time
is a consequence of the progressive tether tightening. A
movie that shows the irreversible snapping of a NW = 4,
NA = 4 cluster during the simple pulling mode of disas-
sembly is available in the supplemental material, together
with a movie of the prising scheme.

Work distributions and the extracted free energies of
disassembly are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively,

reduced errors. Note that we should not expect the values of
∆FMD to be the same for each protocol, due to the diﬀerence
in ﬁnal tether strength.

ure 5 we present the grand potential of clusters contain-
ing up to six molecules of each species. We employ sul-
phuric acid and water monomer densities of 2.804× 10−9
and 8.531 × 10−8 Å-3 respectively, (2.804 × 1015 and
8.531 × 1016 cm−3 in more commonly used units) which
were chosen to make the deviations of the surface from
planarity most apparent. The surface has a saddle point
and hence a critical cluster at NA ≈ 4 and NW ≈ 3 for
this case.

It should be emphasised that these monomer densi-
ties do not correspond to conditions for observed particle
nucleation [28, 35]. The acid monomer density is sev-
eral orders of magnitude higher than the typical range of
106−108 cm−3 for sulphuric acid in the atmosphere at 300
K [35]. It is likely that atmospheric particle nucleation
proceeds with the participation of additional molecular
species, so we do not expect to ﬁnd that our model re-
produces such events. Furthermore, it is quite possible
that the microscopic interactions used in this study are in
need of improvement: an extended model that permits
proton transfer has recently been developed and could
be used to rectify some of its deﬁciencies [36]. A similar
situation was encountered in the earlier demonstration
of the cluster disassembly procedure for a single species,
argon [23]. The extracted cluster thermodynamic prop-
erties were consistent with other studies that used the
same Lennard-Jones interactions, but the implied cor-
respondence with experimental nucleation rates for that
substance was known to be poor [3, 37]. Similarly, we
place emphasis here on the successful implementation of
the disassembly procedure and the determination of clus-

units of Å-3. The mesh is interpolated between integer values

ter thermodynamic properties starting from a molecular
interaction scheme rather than a presentation of realistic
correlation with data. Indeed, such is the sensitivity of
cluster populations to details of the interactions, we tend
to regard a comparison with data to be informative of
the molecular interactions rather than predictive of the
experimental outcomes.

The extracted thermodynamic information can be used
as the basis of a kinetic theory of binary nucleation
[15, 38, 39] but our main objective is to compare the
results with a recent thermodynamic analysis based on
optimised cluster conﬁgurations and harmonic thermal
ﬂuctuations obtained from quantum chemistry [13]. We
expect diﬀerences in outcomes since the force ﬁeld we
use is a classical representation of quantum mechanical
interactions and might lack detail such as a description
of molecular dissociation (though this can be remedied
[36]), but equally, the harmonic approach might not cap-
ture the correct entropic contributions to the cluster free
energy since it is fundamentally based on a solid-like con-
ception of each structure. We compare the approaches by
computing the equilibrium populations of clusters. Tech-
nically, these would be clusters in a constrained equilib-
rium where detailed balance is artiﬁcially maintained be-
tween the growth and decay of clusters of all sizes and
compositions. Under the correct kinetics, cluster popu-
lations in a stationary state of steady nucleation may be
related to these equilibrium populations.

We evaluate populations normalised by the popula-
tions of clusters with the same number of acid molecules
but no waters, namely nNM /n0M, in order to make a di-

with the quantum chemical calculations is quite reason-
able, except for the acid tetramer where our approach
cannot account for the striking dominance of the trihy-
drated cluster in the quantum chemical case. It remains
to be seen whether the diﬀerences can be reduced by us-
ing a better classical representation of the interactions, or
by improving the estimation of cluster entropy, or both.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The key to understanding ﬁrst order phase transitions
in complex gaseous mixtures of precursor molecules is to
compute the thermodynamic stability of molecular clus-
ters of various sizes and compositions. Great strides have
been made in recent years in extending quantum chem-
ical methods to this area, but an accurate assessment
of the entropic contributions to the relevant thermody-
namic potentials, for conditions where the clusters are
liquid-like, requires an approach that goes beyond a con-
sideration of harmonic ﬂuctuations, currently implying
lengthy simulation times or a reduction in the level of
treatment from quantum to classical dynamics.

Figure 6. Populations of a variety of clusters of sulphuric acid
and water at two water monomer densities, normalised to sum
to unity for each value of NA (and hence independent of sul-
phuric acid monomer density), calculated using our approach
(light grey) and taken from Henschel et al. [13] (dark grey).

Our approach is to employ a simpliﬁed force ﬁeld for
complex molecules ﬁtted to quantum chemical compu-
tations [30] and then to use a nonequilibrium classical
molecular dynamics procedure to compute the free en-
ergy associated with the disassembly of a cluster into its
constituent molecules, avoiding a harmonic approxima-
tion to the cluster entropy. The separation is brought
about by the motion of guide particles, each of which is
tethered to one of the molecules in the cluster. The ap-
proach oﬀers advantages over typical Monte Carlo meth-
ods since the assessment of the properties of a particular
cluster is more direct. We do not have to go through a
lengthy comparison of ensembles of clusters diﬀering by
only one molecule at a time; instead we immediately re-
fer a cluster to a system of separated, though tethered,
molecules. The approach is intrinsically a nonequilibrium

a cluster in a ﬁnite period of time, driving the system
away from equilibrium. We exploit the Jarzynski equal-
ity [24] to extract equilibrium free energy changes from a
distribution of nonequilibrium work, while taking care to
ensure that the outcomes are independent of the protocol
of manipulation.

In this study, we have extended the method to clusters
consisting of two molecular species, noting that it could
easily be generalised to an arbitrary number. The anal-
ysis speciﬁes the way in which the cluster constituents
should initially be tethered, and how the free energy
of disassembly should be combined with energy and en-
tropy tethering corrections to produce the grand poten-
tial that characterises clusters in a binary vapour. When
presented as a surface, the grand potential conveys the
intuitive idea of a thermodynamic barrier with a critical
cluster and preferred path of formation. Our approach
provides a new way to construct such a surface in a con-
trolled and well deﬁned fashion, and furthermore, our
presentation does not require input of the densities of
vapours in equilibrium with the condensed phase, which
can complicate the formalism.

We have demonstrated the approach by studying the
important binary system of sulphuric acid and water, and
have compared our results with those obtained recently
using optimised conﬁgurations obtained from quantum
chemistry together with harmonic ﬂuctuations. The force
ﬁeld employed is simpliﬁed, and in particular does not
allow proton transfers, but more elaborate models have
recently been developed and could be employed in fur-
ther studies [36]. We give particular attention to eﬃcien-
cies available through a suitable performance of the ma-
nipulation.
Instead of simply pulling the cluster apart
with soft harmonic forces, where disassembly proceeds

9

through a sequence of irreversible and violent snapping or
tearing events, we prise the molecules apart using guide
particles that exert increasingly strong forces while po-
sitioned at close range to the cluster. Such a protocol
favours molecular removal from the cluster in a man-
ner that is mechanically more reversible, which means
that the free energy of disassembly can be obtained from
shorter MD simulations. We required 2-3 days of time
on the multiprocessor Legion computing facility at UCL
to study 46 clusters containing diﬀerent numbers of the
two molecular species.

Our computations do not capture all the dynamic sub-
tleties of a treatment at electronic level, since they are
based on a ﬁtted classical force ﬁeld, but they are very
much faster to perform than ab initio methods, and
should do better in assessing the entropy of a liquid-like
cluster. The comparison between our results and those
of Henschel et al. [13] is very reasonable and this study
will pave the way for further investigations based on im-
proved force ﬁelds [36] and a wider variety of molecular
species [30].
