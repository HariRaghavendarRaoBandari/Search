Introduction

The inverse-square-root potential V (r) = −α/
r is a long-range potential which has both
scattering states and bound states. As a long-range potential, the inverse-square-root po-
tential has a much longer range than the Coulomb potential. Its scattering state has a very
diﬀerent asymptotic behavior from that of the Coulomb potential. Its bound state, other
than that of the Coulomb potential, has no closed classical orbits. An exact solution of the
inverse-square-root potential enables us to investigate the behavior of long-range potentials
deeply.

The inverse-power potential V (r) ∼ 1/rs with 0 < s < 2 is a long-range potential and
has both scattering states and bound states; while V (r) ∼ 1/rs with s ≥ 2 is a short-
range potential and has only scattering states. The short-range power potential, 1/rs with
s ≥ 2, has only scattering states and can be generally treated [1, 2]. The long-range power
potential, 1/rs with 0 < s < 2, only when s = 1, the Coulomb potential, is exactly solved.
In this paper, we present an exact solution of the inverse-square-root potential —– one
other long-range potential.

The ﬁrst thing we need to do is to determine the boundary condition, the value of the
wave function on the boundary. At inﬁnity, for scattering states, the wave function must
equal the large-distance asymptotics; for bound states, the wave function must equal zero.
Diﬀerent long-range potentials have diﬀerent scattering boundary conditions, because
the boundary condition of long-range-potential scattering at inﬁnity is the large-distance
asymptotic solution of the potential and, in general, the asymptotic solutions of diﬀerent
long-range potentials are diﬀerent. Therefore, we have to determine the scattering boundary

condition one by one for various long-range potentials, rather than short-range-potential
scattering in which all potentials have the same scattering boundary condition. For this
reason, in order to solve the inverse-square-root potential, a long-range potential, we need
to solve its large-distance asymptotic solution ﬁrst.

In section 2, we convert the radial equation of the inverse-square-root potential to the
biconﬂuent Heun equation. In section 3, we solve the regular solution and in section 4 we
solve the irregular solution. The exact solutions of bound and scattering states are given
in section 5. The conclusion is given in section 6.

r → ∞, for scattering states, the boundary condition is ul (r → ∞) = u∞

The equation of fl (z), eq. (2.4), is just the so-called biconﬂuent Heun equation [3].

3 Regular solution

The regular solution is a solution satisfying the boundary condition at r = 0. At r = 0, the
boundary condition for both bound states and scattering states is [4]

because the asymptotic solution of the radial equation (2.2) at r = 0 is ul (r) r→0∼ rl+1 [5].

Irregular solution

4
The irregular solution is a solution satisfying the boundary condition at r → ∞. At r → ∞,
the bound state and the scattering state require diﬀerent boundary conditions.

4.1 Scattering boundary condition

The scattering boundary condition is determined by the asymptotic solution of the radial
equation (2.2) at r → ∞. For long-range potentials, the asymptotic behavior is determined
by the potential, so diﬀerent potentials give diﬀerent scattering boundary conditions. As a
comparison, for short-range potentials, the large-distance asymptotic behavior is determined
by the centrifugal potential l (l + 1) /r2 which indeed comes from the kinetic energy rather

– 3 –

than the external potential, so the asymptotic solution and, then, the scattering boundary
condition, are the same for all short-range potentials.

To determine the scattering boundary condition, we ﬁrst solve the asymptotic solution

of the radial equation (2.2).

Writing the radial wave function ul (r) as

ul (r) = eh(r) exp (±ikr)

and substituting into the radial equation (2.2) give the equation of h (r):

h(cid:48)(cid:48) (r) +(cid:2)h(cid:48) (r)(cid:3)2 ± 2ikh(cid:48) (r) =

The leading-order contributions on the right-hand side and the left-hand side of eq. (4.2)
must be the same order of magnitude, so we have

Irregular solution

With the scattering boundary condition at r → ∞, eq. (4.14), we can now determine the
irregular solution which is the solution satisfying the boundary condition at r → ∞.

The biconﬂuent Heun equation (2.4), which relates the radial equation by the sub-
stitution (2.3), has two linearly independent solutions satisfying the scattering boundary
condition (4.14) [3]

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present an exact solution of the spherical symmetry inverse-power potential
√
−α/
r.
It is worthy to emphasized here that we can put a stronger deﬁnition for long-range
potentials:
if the asymptotic behavior of a potential is the same as that of short-range
potentials, i.e., large-distance asymptotics is e±ikr, the potential is a short-range potential.
Under this deﬁnition, the inverse-power potential V (r) ∼ 1/rs with 0 < s < 1 is a long-
range potential, but V (r) ∼ 1/rs with 1 < s < 2 is a short-range potential. Even under
√
such a stronger deﬁnition, the inverse-power potential α/
r is still a long-range potential.
The three-dimensional inverse square root potential is a long-range potential. The
diﬃculty of the study of long-range-potential scattering is that the scattering boundary
condition is determined by the external potential rather than the centrifugal potential as
that in short-range-potential scattering. Scattering boundary conditions for diﬀerent large-
distance potentials are diﬀerent. To seek the scattering boundary condition for long-range
potentials needs to ﬁrst determine the large-distance asymptotic solution. There are some
discussions on the long-range-potential scattering [7–9]. Scattering by combination of known
long-range and unknown short-range potentials is studied by the renormalization-group
method [10]. The late-time dynamics of the wave equation with a long-range potential is
discussed in ref. [11]. The spectral property of scattering matrix of the Schrödinger operator
with a long-range potential is considered in ref. [12]. Scattering on black holes is essentially
a kind of long-range scattering.
[13, 14]. The partial derivative of scattering phase shifts
with respect to wave number k for long-range potentials is given in ref. [4]. There are many

– 8 –

eﬀorts on seeking the scattering phase shift [15, 16]. There are also studies on the orbit
in power-law potentials [17], the screened Coulomb potential, and the isotropic harmonic
oscillator [18]. The number of bound states [19, 20], the number of eigenstates [21, 22], the
conditions for the existence of bound states [23, 24] are also important problems.
