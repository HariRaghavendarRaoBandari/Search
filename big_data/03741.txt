Abstract

A nuciferous graph is a simple graph with a non-singular 0-1 adjacency matrix A such
that all the diagonal entries of A−1 are zero and all the oﬀ-diagonal entries of A−1 are non-
zero. Sciriha et al. conjectured that except K2, no nuciferous graph exists. We disprove this
conjecture. Moreover, we conjecture that there inﬁnitely many nuciferous Cayley graphs.

Introduction

Let G be a simple graph with non-singular 0-1 adjacency matrix A. If all the diagonal entries of
A−1 are zero and all the oﬀ-diagonal entries of A−1 are non-zero, then G is called a nuciferous
graph. The concept of nuciferous graphs has arisen in the context of the quantum mechanical
theory of the conductivity of non-singular carbon molecules in the Source and Sink Potential
model [2]. According to Sciriha [4]:

“In the graph-theoretical Source and Sink Potential model, a molecule is either an
insulator or a conductor for electrons with energy zero. Of particular interest are two
classes of graphs with analogous vertex pairs, i.e., the same behavior for any two-
vertex connection. These are uniform-core (insulating for all two-vertex connections)

1

and nuciferous graphs, which conduct for all two-vertex connections. A graph G in
the ﬁrst class reaches the minimum possible nullity when any two distinct connecting
vertices are deleted.
In the second class, the nullity reaches one, the maximum
possible, when any vertex is deleted.”

To date, the only nuciferous graph known is K2 which we call it the trivial one. In [5] it was
conjectured that there are no others. We disprove this conjecture.

We remark that in [1] weighted graphs that have an adjacency matrix with the required

structure in the inverse as in nuciferous graphs were found.

2 Nuciferous Cayley graphs

Making use of the database of vertex-transitive graphs by Gordon Royle [3] and an exhaustive
computer search, we found several nuciferous graphs. In fact among vertex-transitive graphs
with at most 31 vertices, there are 21 nuciferous graphs. All the 21 nuciferous graphs we found
are Cayley graphs: 6 on 24, 3 on 28 and 12 on 30 vertices. Recall that a Cayley graph Cay(Γ, S)
for a given group Γ and connection set S ⊂ Γ is the graph with vertex set Γ and with u connected
to v if and only if vu−1
∈ S. Table 1 shows the list of nuciferous Cayley graphs up to 31vertices
according to their groups in which Cn and Dn denote cyclic and dihedral groups of order n,
respectively, and Symk and Altk denote the symmetric and alternative groups on k elements,
respectively. We notice that in Table 1 the two degree 7 graphs on Alt4 × C2 are isomorphic to

the two degree 7 on Sym4; all the degree 11 graphs are isomorphic; and the degree 15 graph on
C30 is isomorphic to one of the degree 15 graphs on D30.

Table 2 depicts the adjacency matrix A and the inverse A−1 of one of the two nuciferous
Cayley graphs with 24 vertices on the group Alt4 × C2. Based on our ﬁndings on nuciferous
Cayley graphs we pose the following:

Conjecture 1. There exist inﬁnitely many nuciferous Cayley graphs.
