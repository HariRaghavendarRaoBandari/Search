(Dated: March 8, 2016)

To verify the

eﬀect of geometrical

frustration, we artiﬁcially distort

the triangular
lattice of quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3
[BEDT-TTF:
bis(ethylenedithio)terathiofulvalene] by analogous-molecular substitution and apply 13C NMR of
bulk and substituted sites, electric conductivity, and static magnetic susceptibility measurements.
The results indicate that the magnetic characteristics of the substituted sample are quantitatively
similar to those of the pure sample. Moreover the magnetic characteristics at the substituted sites
are also the same as in the bulk. These results suggest that the observed magnetic properties may
not be due to the geometrical frustration but the importance of disorder.

I.

INTRODUCTION

κ-(BEDT-TTF)2X salts are well-known organic con-
ductors based on bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene
(BEDT-TTF) molecules which form dimers in the con-
duction layer. The compound X − is a monovalent anion,
so the formal charge of BEDT-TTF is +0.5. Although
this is regarded as a quarter-ﬁlled system, the electronic
state of κ-(BEDT-TTF)2X is believed to be half ﬁlled
due to the dimerization of the BEDT-TTF molecules1.

At ambient pressure, the ground state of κ-(BEDT-
TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 [hereafter abbreviated as the (CN)3
salt] is expected to be antiferromagnetic (AF) because
its ratio of U/W is greater than that for κ-(BEDT-
TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl
[hereafter abbreviated as the Cl
salt]2, where U is the eﬀective onsite Coulomb repul-
sion and W is the bandwidth, respectively. Contrary
to the expectation, the (CN)3 salt exhibits no magnetic
ordering3. One possible reason no-AF ordering occurs
in (CN)3 salt is the contribution of geometrical frus-
tration of spins3. From density functional theory, we
know that at room temperature, the ratio of interdimer
transfer integrals t′/t = 0.83 is very close to unity4–6,
where t is the nearest neighbor transfer and t′ is the
second-nearest neighbor transfer, respectively. Moreover,
as the exchange interaction, J(t) = −2t2/U , the ratio of
J(t′)/J(t), is close to unity, suggesting a nearly isotropic
triangular lattice with S = 1/2. In this case, AF order-
ing could be suppressed by the geometrical frustration
of the spins7. However, optical conductivity measure-
ments of (CN)3 salt do not reveal a clear-cut energy gap
at all temperatures8,9, which is expected from a Mott in-
sulator due to the concomitant large U/W . Moreover,
charge instability below 60 K was reported in (CN)3 salt
by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)10,11 and Ra-
man spectroscopy12.

Disorder or randomness is a source of localization in
strongly correlated electron systems. In this case, con-
duction electrons localize by impurity scattering to form
an Anderson insulator. Contrary to a Mott insulator,
no gap appears at the Fermi surface in Anderson insu-
lators. Some theories predict that a soft Hubbard gap

whose density of state with zero density of states at EF
emerges by introducing disorder to the strongly corre-
lated electron system13–15. Due to competition between
electron correlation and randomness, a Mott–Anderson
transition is expected. Recently, the disorder in the an-
ion groups has been suggested to act on the BEDT-TTF
layers via hydrogen bonds, whereby the charge distribu-
tion is altered and domain boundaries appear in (CN)3
salt16. Therefore, the relationship between the physical
properties and disorder in (CN)3 salt is of signiﬁcant re-
search interest.

Experimental observations in (CN)3 salt have been
explained through triangular-lattice or disordered-state
models. Therefore, experimental veriﬁcation is required
to determine whether the observed behavior is due to
the the geometrical frustration of the spins in the trian-
gular lattice or to a disordered state. One approach is to
artiﬁcially distort triangular lattices. To investigate the
disorder eﬀects of the Mott-insulating state, Cl salt was
irradiated by x-ray irradiation, which introduces disorder
and changes the Mott-insulating state of the Cl salt into
a soft-Hubbard-gapped insulating state17 and, simulta-
neously, AF ordering disappears18.

Note that x-ray irradiation mainly aﬀects on the crys-
tal surface owing to the absorption by Cu atoms and pro-
duces free radicals on the surface. Therefore, this tech-
nique is not suited for investigating the magnetic proper-
ties. Moreover, it is unclear whether x-ray irradiation and
anion disorder via hydrogen bonding in pure samples in-
troduces disorder in the conduction plane. An alternative
approach is analogous-molecular substitution to directly
introduce disorder into the conduction layer, which is the
method we use herein. Speciﬁcally, we focus on a unsym-
metric (us-) bis-(ethylenedithio)diselenadithiafulvalene
(BEDT-STF), where in one side of the S in the cen-
tral ring of the TTF skeleton is replaced with Se atoms
(see Fig. 1 (b)). The advantages of substituting BEDT-
STF for BEDT-TTF are that (i) structural distortion is
minimized because BEDT-TTF and BEDT-STF have al-
most the same molecular structure, (ii) the large spread
of Se 4d orbital creates suﬃcient disorder to aﬀect the in-
termolecular transfer integrals, and (iii) the substitution

fraction and uniformity can be determined by elemental
analysis to detect the Se atoms, which exist only at sub-
stituted sites. However, the primary important advan-

FIG. 1. Molecular structures of (a) BEDT-TTF and (b) us-
BEDT-STF.

tage is that the transfer integrals around the BEDT-STF
molecule are modiﬁed by the Se orbitals, which locally
distorts the triangular lattice.

NMR is a microscopic probe that measures the static
and dynamic magnetic properties. The local spin sus-
ceptibility can be determined from the Knight shift K,
and magnetic ﬂuctuations from the spin-lattice relax-
ation rate T −1
. Many previous NMR studies of BEDT-
TTF salts have contributed important information on
these salts19,20. Herein, to elucidate the magnetic prop-
erties of (CN)3 salt, we apply 13C NMR to bulk BEDT-
TTF sites and compare the NMR results of pure samples
with those of BEDT-STF-substituted samples.

Moreover, it is expected that local impurities induce
staggered moments at the center of disorder in the vicin-
ity of antiferromagnetic compounds. However, few NMR
studies of impurity sites exist. To address this void,
we substitute 13C enriched BEDT-STF for non-enriched
BEDT-TTF molecules so that 13C-NMR targets the im-
purity sites.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

Single

of

crystals

κ-[(BEDT-TTF)1−x(BEDT-
STF)x]2Cu2(CN)3 of various stoichiometry (x = 0,
0.05, and 0.06) were prepared by the electrochemical
oxidation21. Using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
with λ-(BEDT-STF)2GaCl4 as a reference, the impurity
fraction x was determined by comparing the intensity of
S atoms to that of Se atoms. Samples with x=0 and 0.05
consisted of 13C-enriched BEDT-TTF and non-enriched
BEDT-STF, and a sample with x = 0.06 consisted of
13C-enriched BEDT-STF and non-enriched BEDT-TTF.
To avoid the Pake-doublet problem22, one side of the
central C=C bond in BEDT-TTF, and that of the
central C=C bond far from Se atoms in BEDT-STF
are enriched with the 13C isotope.
13C-substituted
molecule were prepared through cross coupling23. DC
conductivity was measured along the b axis from room

2

temperature down to 40 K for the pure and x = 0.05
samples by the standard four-point probe technique. DC
magnetization was measured for polycrystalline samples
as a function of temperature from 300 to 2 K in a 2 T
magnetic ﬁeld using a magnetometer that is based on
a superconducting quantum interference device. NMR
experiments were performed for each single crystal in a
7 T magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular to conduction
plane. The NMR shifts are given in ppm relative to
tetramethylsilane. The spin-lattice relaxation rate, T −1,
was measured by the conventional saturation-recovery
method. The linewidths were determined by ﬁtting
peaks to a Lorentz function, and the spin-spin relaxation
rate, T −1
, is deﬁned as the rate corresponding to Lorentz
decay.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Modiﬁcation of transfer integrals

We consider the modiﬁcation of transfer integrals due
to the extended 4d orbital of the Se atoms. The 5 %,
BEDT-STF substitution shown in Fig. 1(b) modiﬁes the
transfer integrals of the aﬀected sites as shown in Fig. 2.
In fact, the transfer integral in the side-by-side direction
of the BEDT molecules of α-(BEDT-STF)2I3 is 46.5%
24. Therefore,
greater than that of α-(BEDT-TTF)2I3
the interdimer transfer integrals around the substituted
dimer may be estimated to be approximately 20% greater
than that of the original dimer. As shown in Fig. 2, 20%
of the triangular lattices are distorted; thus, the result-
ing area of the original triangular lattice is conﬁned to a
radius of 2–3 dimers. To verify the eﬀect of disorder, we
measured the electrical conductivity and compared the
results with those of previous reports.

B. Conductivity

Figure 3 shows conductivity normalized to the data at
room temperature for E k b as a function of temperature
for both samples. In the pure sample, the result is consis-
tent with that of previous report16, whereas the decrease
of the conductivity near room temperature is suppressed
in the x = 0.05 sample. The conductivities of both sam-
ples are ﬁt by the nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNH) and
variable-range-hopping (VRH) equations.

σ(T ) ∝ exp(−∆/T ),
σ(T ) ∝ exp[(−T0/T )1/(d+1)],

where ∆ is the activation energy for the NNH model, T0 is
the activation energy for the VRH model, d is the dimen-
sion of the VRH model, and Tcross is the crossover tem-
perature from the NNH model in the high-temperature
region to the VRH model in the low temperature region.
For the pure sample, the conductivity can be ﬁt by the
NNH model above Tcross, wheareas the VRH model with
d = 2 is suitable below Tcross, as shown in Fig. 3 (a)
where the dashed (solid) line represents the ﬁt with the
VRH (NNH) model (the ﬁtting parameters are given in
Table I). For x = 0.05 sample, the VRH model with d = 1
is suitable compared to d = 2 below Tcross. Conductiv-
ity above Tcross signiﬁcantly diﬀers between the pure and
x = 0.05 samples. For x = 0.05 sample, temperature
dependence of conductivity is not much changed above
Tcross. Although the temperature dependence of the con-
ductivity can be ﬁt by the NNH model, the obtained
value of ∆ is too small to explain the crossover from the
NNH to VRH model. The results indicate that the sub-
stitution enhances conduction and increases Tcross above
that of the pure sample. As BEDT-STF substitution
does not introduce carriers, we must rule out any eﬀect
due to carrier doping. To explain the results for d = 1
and the x = 0.05 sample, we suggest that competition be-
tween electron correlations and randomness possibly play
a role15. For both samples, the VRH ﬁt suggests that
no intrinsic energy gap opens, and the remarkable eﬀect
of substitution was conﬁrmed by studying the transport
properties of the x = 0.05 sample.

C. Static magnetic susceptibility

The static magnetic susceptibility of the pure and
x = 0.05 samples are shown in Fig. 4, along with the
result of previous work3.
In this ﬁgure, the core dia-
magnetic contribution of −4.37 × 10−4 emu/mol f.u.3 is
already subtracted. For x = 0.05 sample, the tempera-
ture dependence is quantitatively fairly similar to that of
the pure sample; both exhibit a hump around 60 K and
rapidly decrease below 20 K. The value of χ = 5 × 10−4
emu/mol f.u. at 300 K is greater than that found for
other κ salts, i.e., χ = 4.5 × 10−4 emu/mol f.u.25 The
static susceptibility remains essentially unchanged on dis-
tortion of the triangular lattice.

D. NMR spectra, line shift and linewidth

Figure 5 shows the NMR spectra at several tempera-
tures for a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the conduc-
tion plane. The left (right) panel shows the results for
the pure (x = 0.05) sample. Two peaks corresponding to
the inner and outer sites26,27 appear in both spectra. For
both samples, linewidth broadens with decreasing tem-
perature and no AF ordering appears, which is consistent
with the previous reports for the pure material10,26.

Figure 6 shows how the NMR lines shift with tem-
perature. Both samples showed similar line shifts that
were proportional to the spin susceptibility. We obtain
the hyperﬁne coupling constants from the δ-χ plot (see
Fig. 7). Table II summarizes the hyperﬁne coupling con-
stants, which are almost the same for both samples. The
hyperﬁne coupling constant of the inner site is negative,
whereas that of the outer site is positive; this is consis-
tent with other κ salts27. As shown in Fig. 4, the ﬁnite
susceptibility at 0 K seems to remain at approximately
half its value at the room temperature, which is evidence
of a spin liquid. Owing to slight paramagnetic impuri-
ties, the spin susceptibility depends on the subtraction of
the paramagnetic impurities. NMR, however, can detect
local spin susceptibility independent of paramagnetic im-
purities. The NMR shift δ is written as

δ = K + σ = Ahf χs + σ

(3)

where K is the Knight shift, Ahf is the hyperﬁne coupling
constant, and σ is the chemical shift. To discuss the spin
susceptibility, the chemical shift of (BEDT-TTF)+0.5 in
this conﬁguration was determined to be σ = 117 ppm
28.

With decreasing temperature, the NMR shift approaches
to the chemical shift.

inhomogeneity of the local magnetic ﬁeld at the corre-
sponding nuclei. The ﬁrst term is inhomogeneous width
caused by the dynamics and the second term is a static
inhomogeneous width caused by the inhomogeneity of the
external and local magnetic ﬁeld. T −1
can detect slow
magnetic ﬂuctuations.
In the pure sample, the NMR
linewidth gradually broadens with decreasing tempera-
ture, whereas T −1
remains constant, indicating that the
broadening is primarily to inhomogeneous broadening26.
The outer site which has a larger hyperﬁne coupling
constant, has a broader NMR line than the inner site.
Below 10 K, further broadening occurs. To determine
the inhomogeneous linewidth ν, the natural linewidth
of 2.8 kHz determined by T −1
is subtracted from the
FWHM (see Eq. 4). The ratio of the inhomogeneous
linewidth νout/νin is approximately 2 from 60 K, where
the linewidth starts to broaden, down to 10 K. This ra-
tio is comparable to the analogous ratio of the hyperﬁne
coupling constant |Aout/Ain| = 1.64. Thus, the linewidth
broadening correlates with the hyperﬁne coupling con-
stants, suggesting that the spin density on molecules is
inhomogeneous. In other words, ∆K = A∆χ.

2

For the x = 0.05 sample, the line broadening is de-
tected, which is greater than that for the pure sample
from 60 to 15 K. As T −1
for the x = 0.05 sample is in-
dependent of temperature, the increase in linewidths is
attributed to an enhanced static inhomogeneity, as for
the pure sample. The ratio of the inhomogeneous NMR
linewidth νout/νin ≃ 2 resembles that of the hyperﬁne
coupling constant |Aout/Ain| = 1.75. This suggests the

2

impurity substitution enhances the disorder.

Next, we focus on the anomalous increase of the
FWHM of the NMR lines in the low-temperature region.
The NMR linewidth of the spin singlet state is expected
to be narrow. However, the FWHM does not decrease at
low temperature. Recently, µSR measurements by Naka-
jima et al., suggested that spins paramagnetically ﬂuctu-
ate in zero magnetic ﬁeld, and the microscopic phase sep-
arates into the singlet phase and the paramagnetic phase
below 3 K29. To explain these results, Nakajima et al.,
invoked microscopic paramagnetic islands surrounded by
a singlet sea with a ﬁnite gap. As the volume fraction of
the singlet sea is much greater than that of the paramag-
netic area, the paramagnetic spin behaves as a magnetic
impurity, contributing only to the linewidth of the non-
magnetic NMR spectrum. Thus, this picture is consis-
tent with the small Knight shift with a broad linewidth.
Therefore, the ﬁnite susceptibility in the static suscepti-
bility measurements and proportionality of the linewidth
to magnetic ﬁeld at low temperature26 might be the con-
sequence of this paramagnetic component.

For x = 0.05 sample, the FWHM also rapidly increases
below 15 K. One possible explanation of this result is
that the impurity substitution induces the AF moment;
however, this can be ruled out becuase if impurities in-
duce the AF moment, the FWHM for x = 0.05 would
be broader than that for the pure sample. However, the
FWHM is almost the same for both samples at 1.7 K,
in contrast to what happens above 15 K. Conversely, the
paramagnetic island proposed by µSR29 is indepedent
of nonmagnetic impurities such as the BEDT-STF, so
the paramagnetic islands are independent of the BEDT-
STF impurities, resulting in a same-amplitude inhomo-
geneous dipole ﬁeld in both samples, and translating into
the same broadening in both samples.

perature dependence of (T1T )−1 of both samples with
the result from a previous measurement of a double 13C
enriched sample under the same conﬁguration26. We
determined T −1
by separately ﬁtting a single exponen-
tial to the inner and outer sites, or by ﬁtting the two-
exponential models to the sum of the spectral intensity
below 20 K by using the ratio, T1,inner/T1,outer = 3, which
was determined at 100 K. This value is typical of κ-
(BEDT-TTF)2X salts.

As temperature decreases, the quantity (T1T )−1 in-
creases and broadly peaks near 8 K. However, note that
recovery curves for both samples deviate from the expo-
nential ﬁts below 6 K, which suggests distribution of T −1
.
This distribution corresponds to the anomalous broaden-
ing below 8 K. Using (T1T )−1 of the pure sample repro-
duces the results of previous work26. On the basis of the
ratio U/W of (CN)3 salt, a AF transition temperature
TN comparable to that of Cl salt is expected. The sup-
pression of the AF transition indicates the characteris-
tics of the geometrical frustration below the temperature
TN = 27 K30 of the Cl salt. However, the temperature
dependence of (T1T )−1 for x = 0.05 sample is quanti-
tatively similar to that of the pure sample, indicating a
lack of the geometrical frustration.

Impurity site in frustrated spin systems are expected to
behave diﬀerently than bulk site. To verify geometrical
frustration, applying NMR to the impurity sites provides
useful information. However, NMR spectra aﬀected by
impurities has been discussed on the basis of using long
tails of spectrum line on the bulk site. Although us-
ing NMR to detect the impurity-site resonances is diﬃ-
cult in frustrated spin systems, we directly observed 13C-
NMR on impurity sites using 13C-enriched BEDT-STF
molecules.

Figure 10 shows NMR spectra from impurity sites at
several temperatures. Two peaks are observed at 100
K. The NMR shift is less than that of the bulk sites,
indicating a small local spin susceptibility. Linewidth
broadening occurs at low temperature and no AF order-
ing appears.

In frustrated spin systems, impurities can induce lo-
cal staggered moments and line broadening is expected
owing to staggered spin density oscillations, as expected
from the AF character of magnetic correlations31,32. Fig-
ure 11 shows the temperature dependence of FWHM of
the NMR lines from impurity sites as a function of tem-
perature. The FWHM of the NMR line of the impurity
site at 1.7 K is less than that of bulk sites, indicating
that the impurities do not induce staggered moments.

FIG. 11. FWHM of NMR line for impurity and bulk sites as
a function of temperature.

Figure 12 shows (T1T )−1 for the bulk and (T1T )−1
scaled for the impurity sites, both as functions of tem-
perature. Each curve is the mean value of the associ-
ated inner and outer sites. Scaling (T1T )−1 for impurity
sites by a factor of two matches well with the results
for (T1T )−1 for the bulk sites.
In Fermi liquid theory,
(T1T )−1 is proportional to the square of the product of
the hyperﬁne coupling constant Ahf and the density of
state N (EF) at the Fermi energy:

Here, N (EF) corresponds to the local spin susceptibil-
ity. The temperature dependence of (T1T )−1 for impu-
rity sites is similar to that for bulk sites, and the scale fac-
tor indicates a small local susceptibility compared with
that of the bulk sites. The qualitatively similar behav-
ior of both sites suggests that the electronic properties at
bulk and impurity sites are described by one-ﬂuid model.
Note that recovery curves deviate from the exponential
ﬁts below 8 K, which suggests distribution of T −1
. The
NMR spectra from impurity sites are similar to those
from bulk sites, indicating that the magnetic behavior
of (CN)3 salt is not due to the geometrical frustration.
Instead, the suppression of the AF transition and the
electronic state of (CN)3 salt may be due to disorder and
electronic correlation, in addition to the ideal geometrical
frustration, as theoretically suggested13–15.

FIG. 12. Temperature dependence of (T1T )−1 for impurity
and bulk sites. (T1T )−1 for the impurity site is scaled by a
factor of two.

Temperature dependence of conductivity of a sample
with impurity fraction x = 0.05 is not much changed
above 200 K, indicating that the substitution enhances
conductivity and leads to a crossover temperature Tcross
that is greater than that of a pure sample. At low tem-
perature, the x = 0.05 sample exhibits VRH-like conduc-
tivity, suggesting that no intrinsic gap opens and that the
sample is not a Mott insulator like the pure sample16.

The NMR spectra reveal no magnetic ordering, and
the spin susceptibility approaches to the chemical shift
below 3 K in both samples. These results are inconsis-
tent with ﬁnite susceptibility from the static magnetic
measurement at low temperature. From 60 to 15 K, the
NMR linewidth of the x = 0.05 sample becomes broader
than that of the pure sample, indicating the BEDT-STF
substitution enhances disorder. The temperature depen-
dence of (T1T )−1 for both samples is quantitatively sim-
ilar. Moreover, the temperature dependence of (T1T )−1
for impurity sites is similar, suggesting that the char-
acteristics of (T1T )−1 are not due to geometrical frus-
tration. NMR spectra from impurity sites suggest a de-
crease in local spin susceptibility and that no staggered
moments are induced. Thus, the results indicate that the
static and dynamic susceptibility do not change, even at
temperatures two orders of magnitude less than the ex-
change interaction J ≃ 250 K. These results are in stark
contrast to the expected eﬀect of the substitution on con-
ductivity. Thus, we suggest that the electronic state of
(CN)3 salt is not only due to the ideal geometrical frus-
tration but also due to the disorder.

We investigated the conductivity and the magnetic
properties of (CN)3 salt by artiﬁcially distorting its trian-
gular lattice by substitution of BEDT-STF, which intro-
