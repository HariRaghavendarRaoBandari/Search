We describe the collective behavior of a system
of many inelastic spherical particles inside a box
which is being periodically vibrated. The box is
shallow, with large horizontal dimensions, while
the height is less than two particle diameters. The
vibrations are not symmetric: the time the box is
moving up is, in general, different to the time it is
moving down. The limit cycles of isolated grains are
largely affected by the asymmetry of the vibration
mode,
increasing the size in phase space of the
chaotic regions. When many grains are placed in the
box, the phase separation between dense, solid-like
regions, coexisting with ﬂuid-like regions takes place
at smaller global densities for asymmetric vibration
proﬁles. Besides, the order parameter of the transition
takes larger values when asymmetric forcing is used.

1. Introduction
Granular systems, characterized by the dissipative collisional dynamics of macroscopic objects
still defy our understanding. When energy is injected at a high enough rate to compensate for the
dissipated energy dynamical states are generated. Granular media, in many aspects, resemble
molecular ﬂuids. However, the energy dissipated at every collision permanently keeps those
systems in a non-equilibrium state. The origin of the non-equilibrium states is that energy injected
by one mechanism—for example collisions with the walls—is dissipated by a different one,
interparticle collisions. A necessary condition for equilibrium would be detailed balance which is
not present in our system.

It has been shown that varying the injection mechanism generates non-equilibrium states
with different properties. For example, the shear viscosity varies from case to case. Compare the
outcomes in Ref. [1], where the Inelastic Hard Sphere model is used in all cases, but the driving
mechanism is different. Hence it is interesting to study the different behaviors of the system when
different energy injection mechanisms are used.

A particular geometry to study granular systems that has gained interest is the quasi two-
dimensional (Q2D) conﬁguration. In this case grains are put in a shallow box: large horizontal
dimensions and a rather small vertical one. The box is vertically vibrated and the spherical grains
gain energy colliding with the top and bottom plates. This energy is partly transfered to the
horizontal directions through collisions.

Using shallow boxes has many advantages. In experiments, it allows the dynamics of the
granular layer to be fully visualized by imaging the system, as all particles can be seen and
recorded with a camera from the top. This makes it possible to accurately study the system in
a microscopic way, as particle’s positions and velocities can be measured for most particles at
any time. Also the collective behavior can be captured [2–6]. Implied by the energy injection
mechanism, the horizontal kinetic energy of the grains can be quite different from the vertical
kinetic energy [7,8].

When the height of the box is less than twice the particle’s diameter we have a particular
and relevant case: no two particles can be on top of one another. Here, gravity does not play
a direct role in the horizontal dynamics and the indirect effects can be controlled and reduced
by means of increasing the dimensionless acceleration of the box. More importantly, gravity is
perpendicular to the eventual directions of phase separation, allowing to discard many known
mechanisms. Nevertheless, experiments and simulations have shown that segregation can also
take place between grains that differ in size or mass [8,9].

It has been observed that a particular phase separation takes place in shallow boxes: grains
form solid-like regions surrounded by ﬂuid-like ones having high contrasts in density, local order
and granular temperature [2]. This phase separation is driven by the negative compressibility of
the effective two dimensional ﬂuid [3] and, depending on the height of the box, it can be either of
ﬁrst or second order [10,11].

In the present article we study the role that the energy injection plays in the phase separation in
Q2D systems. To do so, keeping the material properties and geometry of the system unchanged,
we vary the waveform proﬁle of the vibration. That is, we change the pure sinusoidal proﬁle
where the upward and downward phases are symmetric, to asymmetric proﬁles where both
phases take different times. Under these conditions we ﬁrst analyze the dynamics of isolated
grains looking for the limit cycles that each one of them develops. For the case of an isolated
particle with no top wall see [12–14]. Next we consider dense regimes where the grains interact
so that phase separation may take place. It is found that asymmetric vibration proﬁles increase the
size of the chaotic regions in phase space and also facilitate phase separation. Our main tool are
event driven molecular dynamics simulations, making use of our own quite efﬁcient strategy [15].

(a) System setup
The grains are inelastic hard spheres with rotational degrees of freedom. These particles are in
a vertically vibrated shallow box, namely we consider granular systems in a box with a height
of the order of two particle diameters and much larger horizontal dimensions. Collisions are
characterized by normal and tangential restitution coefﬁcients as well as friction coefﬁcients.

Figure 1. Conﬁguration of the quasi two-dimensional granular system. The box is periodic in the horizontal directions,
while it is conﬁned by the top and bottom hard walls. The inner height is h. Grains are placed inside the box, which is
vertically vibrated with amplitude A and angular frequency ω.

The diameter σ of the particles, the acceleration of gravity g and the mass m of the particles
are used to deﬁne the dimensionless expressions in this article, except that time is measured in
oscillation periods, T = 2π/ω. The horizontal lenghts of the box Lx and Ly will be different in
different simulations, although in all cases they will be large compared with the conﬁnement
height h = Lz, which is taken to be between 1.8σ and 1.82σ. Simulations to study the phase
separations are done with Lz (cid:28) Ly (cid:28) Lx, where the system remains homogeneous in the y
direction, allowing us to measure the density contrast between the solid-like cluster and the
surrounding liquid-like phase. The vibration is characterized by the amplitude A and frequency
ω. Finally, collisions are characterized by the following mechanical parameters: normal and
tangential restitution coefﬁcients rn and rt, while the static and dynamic friction coefﬁcients are
µs and µd. Their speciﬁc values will be given in each case.

(b) Symmetric proﬁles: sinusoidal versus parabolic
It may seem natural to consider sinusoidal vibrations, but we have studied systems for which the
vibration cycle is characterized by four separate parabolic movements in the sense that the height
depends quadratically in time. The acceleration is piecewise constant, with values a = ±8Aω2/π2.
This parabolic movement is described in detail in the next subsection. It will be interesting to
observe that for a given vibration frequency there is a range of amplitudes for which the system
behaves almost as if there were sinusoidal vibrations.

(c) Asymmetric proﬁles
In our studies energy is injected to the system by means of vertically vibrating the box using
asymmetric modes where, again the acceleration is piecewise constant. We deﬁne the asymmetry
coefﬁcient β, (0 < β < 1), which divides the period in two intervals of size βT and (1 − β)T . In the
ﬁrst interval the box moves down with accelerations a = ±2Aω2/β2π2, while in the second one
the box moves up with accelerations a = ±2Aω2/(1 − β)2π2.

The height Z of the top (+) and bottom (-) walls of the box are given by

For β < 1/2 the downwards interval takes a shorter time than the upward movement (left) and conversely for β > 1/2
(right). For β = 1/2 the function α(τ ; β) resembles cos(2πτ /T ).

The control parameters are the asymmetry parameter β, the amplitude A and angular
frequency ω = 2π/T of the oscillations. The latter is characterized by the dimensionless
acceleration Γ = Aω2/g and dimensionless velocity ζ = Aω/√gσ.

3. A single particle in the vibrating box
In the case of shallow boxes it is important to understand ﬁrst the movement of a single particle.
There are conditions under which the particle ends up in permanent contact with the base of the
box. But if Aω2/g is larger than unity such situation cannot occur. Next, it may happen that the
energy injected to the particle by the basis is not enough for the particle to reach the upper wall in
the long term evolution. We consider conditions under which neither of these last two cases can
take place.

If the single particle is left bouncing for a sufﬁciently large time, its angular and horizontal
translation velocities vanish so that
the movement of the particle becomes strictly one
dimensional and the friction coefﬁcients as well as the tangential restitution coefﬁcient become
irrelevant. There is a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies for which the particle reaches
this quite simple limit cycle characterized by two velocities: the velocities with which the particle
bounces off the two horizontal walls.

Increasing the vibration frequency or the amplitude the limit cycle of the single particle reaches
a threshold above which the limit cycle suffers a bifurcation. Now the grain bounces twice at the
top and bottom walls before repeating its movement. Hence the new limit cycle takes twice the
time associated to the limit cycle just before the bifurcation. There is a chain of bifurcations of this
type until the bouncing of the single particle becomes chaotic. Some cases of the resulting limit
cycles are presented in Fig. 3. All this can be appreciated in Figure 4 where it is seen that other
modes appear as the amplitude grows, that is, the particle has more than one bouncing mode for a

Figure 4. Bouncing velocities after colliding with the top and bottom walls of the shallow box once the particle has reached
a steady state. Left: Varying the vibration amplitude A in the case of the sinusoidal (red) and bi-parabolic (blue) symmetric
proﬁles (β = 1/2). Right: Varying the asymmetry parameter β with ﬁxed vibrating amplitude A/σ = 0.3. The asymmetry

on the obtained velocities around β = 1/2 is due to the presence of gravity. In both ﬁgures, ω = 8(cid:112)g/σ, rn = 0.8, and

given value of the amplitude. Figure 4 includes in red the bouncing velocities when the vibration
is sinusoidal with the same frequency and amplitude as our parabolic vibration. To our surprise,
when β = 0.5 the bouncing velocities are almost exactly the same till about A/σ = 0.2.

Figure 5 presents a qualitative picture of the possible outcomes. Different colors are used to
represent the single period, double period, and chaotic motion cases. The comparison shows how
similar is the behavior with sinusoidal and parabolic proﬁles, except that for large amplitudes the
parabolic proﬁles are more regular. In both cases, a band of chaotic motion is present for small
amplitudes.

Using the same analysis, we consider the asymmetric proﬁle, varying the parameter β in the
case where in the symmetric proﬁle the limit cycle consists on a single bounce on the top and
bottom walls. Figure 4 shows that close to the symmetric case (β ≈ 0.5) the limit cycle is perturbed,
keeping its qualitative behavior but changing the values of the bouncing velocities. Further away

values of β ﬁgure 6 shows that the effect of gravity is obvoius in the case of smaller values of ζ

4. Phase separation
In the case of systems composed by a single species of granular matter there are conditions under
which the system separates into high and low density zones [3]. The results of the previous
section illustrate a central point: the form of the vibration—determined by the parameter β—
has an important effect in the way the system behaves. This is illustrated in Figure 7 which shows
a characteristic state of a vibrated granular system in a narrow 3D box: depending on the value
of β the system may or may not present phase separation. Indeed, with all other parameters ﬁxed
to a case where the symmetric case would yield to a state with no phase separation, forcing with
asymmetric proﬁles induces phase separation.

Figure 7. Top view of a shallow system in a rather narrow box (Ly (cid:28) Lx) in a typical state for a system with common
values for all their parameters except for the value of β. Particles are all the same, but they are represented by black
circles if their height is bellow half the height of the box, otherwise they are represented by gray circles. From top down
β = 0.1, β = 0.5 and β = 0.75. The ﬁrst and third cases have notoriously stable phase separated states, showing large
density contrasts. In all cases N = 410, Lx = 90.01σ, Ly = 4.65σ, h = 1.8σ, rn = rt = 0.91, µd = 0.10, µs = 0.17,

ω = 10(cid:112)g/σ, and A = 0.29σ implying ζ = 2.9 and Γ = 29.0.

and vibration parameters ˜ω = ω/(cid:112)g/σ = 3 and A = 0.29σ; ζ = 0.87, Γ = 2.61. The inelasticity and friction grain-

grain and grain-wall coefﬁcients are rn = rt = 0.91 and µd = 0.10, µs = 0.17.

For a quantitative analysis, we deﬁne the contrast observable c, which is the ratio between
the smaller and larger observed area densities: c = (nmax − nmin)/(nmax + nmin). In the case of

transversal strips and calculating the area density in each strip, deﬁned using the projection of
the particles in each 2D strip.

Figure 8 shows that, in agreement with the snapshots in Fig. 7, the density contrast is larger
when β is away from the symmetric case β = 0.5. A transition line can be identiﬁed where there
is steep increase in c. This transition line indicates that away from the symmetric case, a smaller
number of particles is needed to produce the phase separation. This is clearly presented in the
left panel of Fig. 9, where the contrast is shown as a function of the number of particles for three
values of β. A clear transition is observed, with a critical number of particles that is larger for
β = 1/2.

Figure 9-right presents the contrast c as a function of β for a ﬁxed number of particles and
different values of ω. The collapse between the majority of the curves shows that the mayor impact
in the phase separation is the shape of the vibration rather than the energy injection rate.

5. Conclusions
In this article we have studied the role of changing the energy injection proﬁle of the box
in vibroﬂuidized shallow granular media, where the box moves vertically in a periodic way.
With this aim we modify the oscillation proﬁle. Originally, the proﬁle was symmetric with
piecewise constant accelerations, mimicking a sinusoidal oscillation. This proﬁle was changed to
an asymmetric one, still with piecewise constant accelerations, where the downward and upward
phases take different fractions of the oscillation period: β and 1 − β, respectively.
Single isolated grains reach states where the motion is purely vertical. These states can be
periodic in the form of limit cycles with the same period as the box or with a period that is
an integer multiple of the box period. Also chaotic or irregular motion is possible. The effect
of moving toward asymmetric forcing is to increase the region in parameter space where chaotic
motion is observed. Conversely, it is more probable to ﬁnd regular motion with the same period
as the box for the symmetric forcing.

The asymmetric forcing also has an effect on the phase separation between dense and dilute
regions when many particles are placed in the box. The phase separation takes place for smaller

The previous result suggests that other ways
of increasing the asymmetry could also be efﬁcient in producing phase separation. As an extreme
case, we consider a sawtooth proﬁle at high frequency and small amplitude, such that particles
always meet the walls at the same position and approaching the particles with a ﬁxed velocity.
Figure 10 shows that indeed phase separation takes place and high contrast states can be attained.
It remains as an open question if there is a relation between the accessibility to chaotic behavior
for single particles far from the symmetric proﬁle and the enhanced phase separation in the
collective dynamics with many particles.

Figure 10. Top view of a shallow system in a box of square basis. This is a typical state once phase separation has
taken place. The black/grey coloring is as in Fig. 7. The limit of inﬁnitely rapid vibration is taken (A → 0, ω → ∞, while
Aω = V0 = constant) for a sawtooth proﬁle with no gravity. This state was obtained using N = 1732, Lx = Ly = 40σ,
Lz = 1.9σ, rn = rt = 0.7 (grain-grain), rn = rt = 0.999 (wall-grain), and µs = µd = 0.1.

In Ref. [3] it was shown that the origin of the phase separation is a negative compressibility
region in the effective equation of state of the pressure as a function of density p = p(n). This
equation of state emerges as a consequence of the temperature being enslaved to the density
under high vertical conﬁnement, with T (n) a monotonically decreasing function. Then, equations
of state p = p(n, T ) derived from kinetic theory, with positive compressibility can turn into
effective equations of state with negative compressibility and van der Waals loops [17]. An
attempt to understand why is it that for β far from 0.5 a phase separation takes place for lower
densities it would be necessary to study in the stationary regime the enslaving T (n), which will
depend on β. This analysis needs the study of the limit cycles coupled with the three-dimensional
collisions that transfer energy from the vertical to the horizontal degrees of freedom. This analysis,
beyond the scope of this article, is postponed for a further study

The result of the present article as well as others conﬁrm that the properties of non-equilibrium
systems depend not only on the internal dynamics but also on the energy injection mechanism.
Consistent with this it should be said that there is no guarantee that the conclusions raised here
could be valid for other forcing mechanisms.
