Abstract

We discuss the dynamical Dp-brane solutions describing any number of Dp-branes whose relative

orientations are given by certain SU(2) rotations. These are the generalization of the static angled

Dp-brane solutions. We study the collision of dynamical D3-brane with angles in type II string

theory, and show that the particular orientation of the smeared D3-brane conﬁguration can provide

an example of colliding branes if they have the same charges. Otherwise a singularity appears before

D3-branes collide.

INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent brane solutions in string theory were introduced in [1–29] and have

been widely used ever since. But some aspects of the physical properties such as dynamical

p-brane oriented at angles have remained slightly unclear.

The angled Dp-brane solutions was discovered by [30], following the recognition of the

several role of D-brane conﬁgurations in string theory [31–33]. The classical solution on

ten-dimensional spacetime that should be obtained to introduce oriented at angles in string

theories were studied from several points of view in [21, 30, 33, 34]. They have discussed

the link between the supersymmetric conﬁgurations, intersection of brane and the rotation

angles. The other completely consistent computations for angled D-branes were performed

in [31, 32]. The articles [33, 35, 36] give a thorough review of much of what was known in

the late 1990’s.

These results are more transparent if the dynamical Dp-brane solution in string theory is

discussed in terms of supergravity theory, aiming to reduce everything to ordinary higher-

dimensional general relativity. In the present paper, we will construct new solutions with

nontrivial angles in string theory and study the dynamical behavior that one would expect

of a string theory with the time-dependent ﬁelds and branes.

We start by describing the appropriate ansatz of ﬁelds and metric in string theory, and

ﬁnd the solution of dynamical D2-brane with angle in section II A. The solution is straightfor-

wardly generalized from the static angled D2-brane background. This is a good illustration,

and also an important example in order to understand the orientation of a particular type

brane conﬁguration, which is so called the angled D-brane system [30–32].

Using the T-duality map between the type IIA and IIB string theories we can obtain the

dynamical angled D3- and D4-brane solutions in terms of dynamical D2-branes. In section

II B, we study the time evolution of the dynamical D3-brane background in detail, and also

apply this analysis to the D4-brane with rotation angles in sec. II C. We will summarize the

general dynamical N Dp-brane system with angles in sec. II D, and provide more details

about the collision of two D3-brane in the presence of angles in sec. III. Finally, in section

IV is devoted to summary and discussion.

II. DYNAMICAL Dp-BRANE SYSTEM WITH ANGLES

A. D2-brane with angle

In this section, we consider dynamical D2-branes oriented at some angles in ten dimen-

sions. The ten-dimensional spacetime metric depends on time as well as the rotation angles

which describe the orientations of various D2-branes. First, we write down the Einstein

equations under a particular ansatz for ﬁelds, which is a generalization of the metric form of

known static angled D2-brane solutions. Then, we solve the Einstein equations and present

the dynamical solutions explicitly.

The action for the D2-brane system in the Einstein frame is written as

where κ2 is the ten-dimensional gravitational constant, ∗ is the Hodge dual operator in the
ten-dimensional spacetime, and F(4) is 4-form ﬁeld strength. We assume that the 4-form

F(4) in the action Eq. (1) is now given by

F(4) = dC(3),

(2)

where C(3) is the 3-form gauge ﬁeld. After variations with respect to the metric, the scalar

ﬁeld, and the gauge ﬁeld, we obtain the ﬁeld equations,

1. Single D2-brane

First we consider a single D2-brane solution. The geometry of dynamical D2-brane con-

ﬁguration in ten-dimensional spacetime is assumed to be

ds2 = h−5/8(t, z)(cid:0)−dt2 + γijdyidyj(cid:1) + h3/8(t, z)uab(z)dzadzb ,

γijdyidyj = δijdyidyj + f (t, z)h(cid:0)cos θdy1 − sin θdy2(cid:1)2

h(t, z) = 1 + f (t, z) ,

+(cid:0)cos θdy3 + sin θdy4(cid:1)2i , (4b)

(4c)

(4a)

3

where ds2 is the line element in the Einstein frame in ten dimensions, δij

is the four-

dimensional ﬂat Euclidean metric, and uab is the metric of the ﬁve-dimensional space Z

depending only on the ﬁve-dimensional coordinates za. The dilaton ﬁeld and the gauge ﬁeld

strengths are assumed to be

eφ = h1/2 ,

(5a)

(5b)

F(4) = d(cid:2)1 − h−1(t, z)(cid:3) ∧ dt ∧(cid:0)− sin2 θdy1 ∧ dy3 + sin θ cos θdy1 ∧ dy4

− sin θ cos θdy2 ∧ dy3 + cos2 θdy2 ∧ dy4(cid:1) .

We ﬁrst solve the equation for the gauge ﬁeld strength F(4) . Substituting the above

ansatz for the ﬁelds and the metric form into Eq. (3c), we ﬁnd

Then, the function h is given by

∂t∂ah = 0 ,

△Zh = 0 .

h(t, z) = h0(t) + h1(z) .

(6)

(7)

Then we solve the equation for the scalar ﬁeld; Eq. (3b). Using the assumptions (4) and

(5b), we have

where △Z is the Laplace operator on Z. Combining Eq. (8) with Eqs. (6), (7), we ﬁnd

h−3/8(cid:0)∂2

t h − h−1△Zh(cid:1) = 0 ,

∂2
t h0 = 0 ,

△Zh1 = 0 .

(8)

(9)

Finally we analyze the Einstein equations (3a). Using the ansatz (4) and (5), the Einstein

equations become

where Rab(Z) is the Ricci tensor of the ﬁve-dimensional space Z. Hence, the ﬁeld equations

reduce to

h(t, z) = h0(t) + h1(z) ,

∂2
t h0 = 0 , △Zh1 = 0 , △Zf = 0 .

(11a)

(11b)

This is the exact solution of the present system for any given Ricci ﬂat metric uab.

As an example, we set

uab = δab ,

(12)

where δab is the ﬁve-dimensional Euclidean metric. Then we ﬁnd an exact solution for a

single brane solution:

h0(t) = c0t + c1 ,

h1(z) = c2 +

Q1
|za − za

(1)|3 ,

(13)

where c0, c1, c2, Q1, and za
(1) is
the position of D2-brane. The mass of the brane is given by M1 = |Q1|. If, however, some
spatial dimensions of Z space are smeared by the D2-branes, we will ﬁnd

(1) are constants. Q1 is the charge of the D2-brane, and za

h0(t) = c0t + c1 ,

h1(z) = c2 +

Q1
|za − za
(1)|3−dZ

,

(14)

where dZ(< 5) is the smeared dimensions. For the case of dZ = 3, we have to replace h1 with

h1(z) = c2 + Q1 ln|za − za

(1)|3−dZ .

(15)

Although the above exact solution includes the orientation angle θ in the solution, it

is equivalent to a single brane solution without an angle. In fact we ﬁnd that the above

solution is reduced to a single D2-brane solution without an angle if we rotate the y1-y2, and
y3-y4 planes by the angles θ and −θ, respectively, as

2. Two D2-Branes

Next we construct the exact solutions of two intersecting D2-branes with non-trivial

angle . The ten-dimensional metric, scalar ﬁeld and a single 3-form potential are assumed

to be

ds2 = h−5/8(t, z)(cid:0)−dt2 + γijdyidyj(cid:1) + h3/8(t, z)uab(z)dzadzb ,

γijdyidyj = δijdyidyj + f(1)h(cid:0)cos θ1dy1 − sin θ1dy2(cid:1)2 +(cid:0)cos θ1dy3 + sin θ1dy4(cid:1)2i

+ f(2)h(cid:0)cos θ2dy1 − sin θ2dy2(cid:1)2

+(cid:0)cos θ2dy3 + sin θ2dy4(cid:1)2i ,

h(t, z) = 1 + f(1)(t, z) + f(2)(t, z) + f(1)(t, z)f(2)(t, z) sin2 θ ,

eφ = h1/2 ,

(18a)

(18b)

(18c)

(18d)

C(3) = h−1(t, z)dt ∧(cid:2)−(cid:8)f(1) sin2 θ1 + f(2) sin2 θ2 + f(1)f(2) sin2 (θ1 − θ2)(cid:9) dy1 ∧ dy3

+(cid:0)f(1) sin θ1 cos θ1 + f(2) sin θ2 cos θ2(cid:1)(cid:0)dy1 ∧ dy4 − dy2 ∧ dy3(cid:1)
+(cid:8)f(1) cos2 θ1 + f(2) cos2 θ2 + f(1)f(2) cos2 (θ1 − θ2)(cid:9) dy2 ∧ dy4(cid:3) ,

(18e)

where θ = θ2− θ1. The notable property with the non-trivial angle appears in the non-linear
interaction term in Eq. (18c).

In the following, we consider two D2-brane system with the diﬀerent rotation angles
(θ1, θ2) where θ1 6= θ2. We assume (θ1, θ2) = (0, θ) (θ 6= 0) without loss of generality,
because we can always set one angle to be zero by an appropriate rotation of yi-coordinates.

In terms of the ansatz for ﬁelds and metric, the gauge ﬁeld equation (3c) gives

∂t∂af(1) = 0 ,

△Zf(1) = 0 ,

∂t∂af(2) = 0 ,

△Zf(2) = 0 .

From the equation of scalar ﬁeld, we ﬁnd

h−3/8(cid:2)∂2

t h − h−1(cid:8)(cid:0)1 + f(2) sin2 θ(cid:1)△Zf(1) +(cid:0)1 + f(1) sin2 θ(cid:1)△Zf(2)(cid:9)(cid:3) = 0 .

Under our ansatz, the Einstein equations become

where Rab(Z) is the Ricci tensor of the Z space. Then, the ﬁeld equations reduce to

Rab(Z) = 0 ,

f(1)(t, z) = ˜f(1)(t) + ¯f(1)(z) ,

∂2

¯f(1) = 0 , △Z

(22a)

(22b)

¯f(2) = 0 .

(22c)

For a given Ricci ﬂat Z space, we can obtain the exact solution for two D2-brane system
with diﬀerent angles by solving the above equation (22c). As a result, at least one of ˜f(1)
and ˜f(2) must be constant and then only one brane can be time-dependent, i.e., for α = 1

or 2,

˜f(α) = c(α)0 t + c(α)1 ,

(23)

where c(α)0, c(α)1 are constant, and the other ˜f(β) = c(β)1 (β 6= α) are constant.

3. Generalization to N D2-brane system with diﬀerent angles

Following the same procedure as the case of two D2-brane, we can generalize the so-

lution found in the previous section to the N D2-brane system with diﬀerent angles
θα(α = 1,· · · , N). .

The ten-dimensional metric [30, 33] is given by

ds2 = h−5/8(cid:2)−dt2 + γijdyidyj + huab(Z)dzadzb(cid:3) ,

The metric (24) denotes N D2-brane system such that each brane ﬁrst lying in the (y2, y4)
plane rotates by an angle θα (α = 1,· · · , N) in the (y1, y2) and (y3, y4) planes as (ξ, η) →
(eiθαξ, e−iθαη) where ξ = y1 + iy2 and η = y3 + iy4, which rotation belongs to SU(2) group.

(26b)

The assumption for ﬁelds are a straightforward generalization of the case of a static D2-

brane system with certain SU(2) angle, in the type IIA low energy eﬀective string theory

[30, 33]. From the ﬁeld equations, the ten-dimensional metric (24) have to obey

Rab(Z) = 0 ,

f(α)(t, z) = ˜f(α)(t) + ¯f(α)(z) ,

∂2
t

˜f(α) = 0 ,

∂t ˜f(α)∂t ˜f(β) = 0 , (α 6= β) △Z ¯f(α) = 0 .

(27a)

(27b)

(27c)

This gives the exact solution for N D2-brane system with diﬀerent angles for giving Ricci

ﬂat Z space. As two brane system, only one brane can be time-dependent,

˜f(α) = c(α)0t + c(α)1 ,

(28)

where c(α)0, c(α)1 are constant, and the other ˜f(β) = c(β)1 (β 6= α) are constant. The interest-
ing property for the case with the non-trivial angle is the non-linear interaction term found

in Eq. (25a).

B. D3-brane with angle

Next, we study D3-brane system with angle, which is obtained by a T-duality transfor-

mation from the solutions presented in Sec. II A. Let us consider the D2-brane solutions

(24) . To perform a T-duality along the z5 direction, we have to smear and delocalize the

solution in this direction . Hence h does not depend on z5 .

we obtain the metric of dynamical N D3-brane system in ten-dimensional background as

[30, 33]

rotates by an angle θα (α = 1,· · · , N) in the y1-y2 and y3-y4 planes as (ξ, η) → (eiθαξ, e−iθαη)
where ξ = y1 + iy2 and η = y3 + iy4, which rotation belongs to SU(2) group.

Since we apply the T-duality map from the type IIA to the type IIB theory along ζ = z5 ,

This gives the exact solution for N D3-brane system with diﬀerent angles for giving Ricci

˜f(α) = c(α)0t + c(α)1 ,

(34)

where c(α)0, c(α)1 are constant, and the other ˜f(β) = c(β)1 (β 6= α) are constant.

D. Summary of dynamical Dp-brane system with angles and their properties

In order to ﬁnd the conﬁgurations of a higher dimensional Dp-brane system with angles

(p > 5), we can repeat the above procedure by use of T-duality. For instance, the solution

describing angled D5-brane system would have a two-dimensional transverse Z space, and
then the function ¯f(α)(z) is given by the harmonic function ln[za− za
(α)] (dZ = 0) or [za− za
(α)]
(dZ = 1), while the D6-brane system would have the appearance of an anisotropic domain
wall in one-dimensional transverse Z space, and it is not asymptotically ﬂat ( ¯f(α)(z) ∝
[za − za

(α)]).

We just summarize our result for general N Dp-brane system with diﬀerent SU(2) angles

as follows.

dZ = 5 − p, the power function must be replaced by ln|za − za
(α)|. Qα (α = 1 ,· · · , N) are
the charges (or masses) of Dp-branes and each Dp-brane is located at za

(α), respectively.

2. Properties

One important result with non-trivial angles (θα 6= θβ) is that the non-linear interaction

term between branes appears as in Eq. (45a).

From the solution (45), we ﬁnd that the worldvolume of the time-dependent brane system

in ten dimensions for the static observer is given by √−g ∝ h5(p−3)/8. Hence, if c(α)0 < 0,
it is contracting for p ≥ 4 while expanding for p ≤ 2. The world volume is constant for the
D3 brane system. On the other hand, the transverse space to Dp-brane always contracts as

h(p+1)/16. For the case with c(α)0 > 0, we ﬁnd the opposite behavior.

A curvature singularity appears at h = 0 in the ten-dimensional spacetime. The regular

region in ten-dimensional spacetime is obtained for if and only if h > 0. This regular

spacetime region is bounded by curvature singularities.

13

If dZ ≤ 4 − p, although h diverges on the branes, we ﬁnd a regular spacetime at inﬁnity.

For dZ = 5 − p , since we have

¯f(α)(z) = Qk ln|za − za
the harmonic function h diverges at inﬁnity (|za − za
(α)| → ∞) as well as near Dp-branes
(|za − za
(α)| ≈ 0). Hence such a solution may not be physically relevant. For dZ = 6 − p,
the functions h is given by a sum of linear functions of z. Then this solution gives a regular

(α)| ,

(46)

behavior near branes, although the spacetime is not asymptotically ﬂat.

As a result, the physically relevant solutions are classiﬁed by their behaviors into two
classes: dZ ≤ 4 − p and dZ = 6 − p. The collision of branes shows diﬀerent behaviors as we
will see later.

3. Compactiﬁed spacetime

Since some dimensions are homogeneous, we can discuss the dynamics of a compactiﬁed

spacetime. We compactify some dimensions of homogeneous spaces (Y-space, ζ m-space,
and dZ dimensional smeared Z-space). We assume that Y-space, ζ m-space and dc(≤ dZ)
dimensions in smeared Z-space are compacitiﬁed. As a result, we ﬁnd (d + 1)-dimensional

inhomogeneous compactiﬁed spacetime in the Einstein frame as

d+1 = −h− d
ds2

d−1 dt2 + h− 1

d−1 dz2
d ,

(47)

where d = 7 − p − dc.

In the far region from the branes, since h ≈ c(α)0t for c(α)0 > 0, this spacetime expands
as |τ − τ0|− 1
d−2 for d 6= 2 or exp[∓c(α)0(τ − τ0)] for d = 2, where τ is the cosmic time
in the (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime and τ0 is an integration constant, which is given by
(τ − τ0) ∝ t
inhomogeneous (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime, it cannot describe our universe. It does not

2(d−1) for d 6= 2 or (τ − τ0) = ± 1

ln t for d = 2. However, since this is an

c(α)0

d−2

describe a time-dependent black hole system either because of the present too simple brane

conﬁguration[8–10].

In order to discuss cosmology, we must ﬁnd our three space in the homogeneous spaces

(Y-space, ζ m-space, and a subset of dZ dimensional smeared Z-space) by ﬁxing za coordinates

of unsmeared Z-space. This means that our universe is described by a test 3-brane located at

14

some point za = za

(0). If we choose our three space in Y-space, we ﬁnd our four-dimensional

spacetime in the Einstein frame as

ds2

(p+1)dZ

16

4 = h−

(cid:0)−dt2 + dy2
3(cid:1) .
Since h ≈ c(α)0t (c(α)0 > 0), the universe expands as |τ − τ0|−
32−(p+1)dZ where τ is the cosmic
time of our universe. For D3-branes (p = 3), since dZ ≤ 4, the power exponent is always
negative, which shows a power-law inﬂation when τ → τ0[40], except for the case of dZ = 0
which is just a Minkowski spacetime.

(48)

(p+1)dZ

In what follows, using the solutions obtained in this paper, we shall discuss the collision

of D3-branes with diﬀerent angles in ten-dimensional spacetime.

III. COLLISION OF DYNAMICAL D3-BRANE

A. Collision of two D3-branes

We now discuss collision of two D3-branes with diﬀerent angles. The behavior of the
harmonic function ¯f(α)(z) is classiﬁed into two classes depending on the number of smeared
dimensions of the D3-brane, that is, dZ ≤ 1 and dZ = 3, which we will discuss below
separately. For dZ = 2, the harmonic function ¯f(α)(z) diverges both at inﬁnity and near

D3-branes.

1. dZ ≤ 1

The harmonic function h becomes dominant in the limit of za → za

(α) (α = 1 and 2).
Hence, we recover a static spacetime of the Dp-brane system near branes. On the other
hand, the function h depends only on time t in the limit of |za| → ∞. As a result, in the
far region from branes, the homogeneous spacetime is found.

In order to analyze the brane collision, we consider a concrete example as follows: Two

D3-branes are located at za
(2) = (z(2), 0, . . . , 0). We assume that
˜f(1) is time-dependent, and we discuss the time evolution separately with respect to the

(1) = (z(1), 0, . . . , 0) and za

signature of a constant c(1)0 , because the behavior of spacetime strongly depends on it.

Since the spacetime is singular at h(t, z) = 0, the regular spacetime is obtained inside the

15

spacetime region restricted by

where the function f (t, z) is given by with

h(t, z) = 1 + f (t, z) > 0 ,

f (t, z) = c(1)0t + c(1)1 + c(2)1 +

(49)

(50)

We have set ¯c1 = ¯c2 = 0 without loss of generality. Since the spacetime cannot be extended

beyond this region, the regular spacetime with two D3-branes ends on these singular hyper-

surfaces. The solution with c(1)0 > 0 is the time reversal one of c(1)0 < 0, because the time

dependence appears only in the form of c(1)0t. In the following, we consider the case with

c(1)0 < 0.

For c(1)0 < 0 and the appropriate choice of the constant c, if Q1, Q2 > 0, the ten-

is positive everywhere.

dimensional spacetime is nonsingular at the initial time (t = 0) because the function h
In the limit of t → −∞, the ten-dimensional spacetime becomes
asymptotically a time-dependent uniform background except for the cylindrical forms of
inﬁnite throats near branes (|za − za

(α)| ≈ 0).

As time evolves (t > 0), the singularity appears from a far region (|z−z(α)| → ∞) and the
singular hypersurface erodes the region with the large values of |z − z(α)|. As a result, only
the region of near D3-branes remains regular. A singular hypersurface eventually surrounds

each D3-brane individually and then the regular regions near D3-branes splits into two

isolated throats.

In Fig. 1, for the case of dZ = 1, we show the proper distance d(t, θ) between two branes
(1) and za

(2), which is deﬁned by

1, we choose c(1)0 = −1,
Q1 = Q2 = 1 and z(1) = −z(2) = −1.

In Fig.

Fig. 1 shows that a singularity appears earlier as he angle θ increases from 0 to π/2, but

the singularity always appears before the distance d vanishes. Then, a singularity between

two D3-branes forms before they collide each other.

FIG. 1: (a) For the case of Q1 = Q2 in the dynamical D3-branes, the proper distance between
two dynamical D3-branes given in (51) is depicted. We ﬁx dZ = 1 , c(1)0 = −1, Q1 = Q2 = 1,
z(1) = −1 , z(2) = 1 , and c(1)1 = c(2)1 = 1 for the angle 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π . A singularity appears
between two D3-branes and the spacetime split into two isolated brane throats before they collide.
(b) We also show the proper distance d(t) between two dynamical D3-branes for θ = 0 (dashed
curve), θ = π/4 (bold curve) and θ = π/2 (solid curve) from the bottom in the case of dZ = 1 ,
Q1 = Q2 = 1, z(1) = −1 , z(2) = 1, and , c(1)0 = −1 in the dynamical D3-brane system. Although
the proper distance decreases as t increases, the distance is still ﬁnite when a singularity appears.

There is no qualitative diﬀerence when we have the diﬀerent magnitudes of charges. Two

branes approach very slowly, but a singularity eventually appears at a ﬁnite distance and

the spacetime splits into two isolated D3-brane throats.

We should also mention about the case with diﬀerent signs of charges (a system of the D3-

brane and anti D3-brane). If Q1 and Q2 have the diﬀerent signs, we ﬁnd that there always

exists a singularity between two branes. Hence we cannot even set up such a situation from

the beginning. It is, however, not the case for dZ = 3 (See the next subsection).

Hence, we cannot discuss a D3-brane collision in the case of dZ ≤ 1.

2. dZ = 3

Next we consider the case dZ = 3 . We set two D3-branes with a brane charge Q1 at

z = z(1) and the other Q2 at z = z(2). The solution for ¯f(α)(z) is obtained explicitly as

¯f(α)(z) = Qk |z − z(α)| ,

(52)

where Qk and z(α) are constant parameters. We set ¯cα = 0 without loss of generality.

(53)

The proper distance is a monotonically decreasing function of t if we set again c(1)0 < 0 .

We illustrate d(t, θ) for the case of the D3-brane system in Fig. 2. We also depict the proper

distance d(t) for a given angles θ = 0, π/4 and π/2, and the angular dependence of the proper
distance d(θ) at some particular times t = 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 4 and 5 in Fig. 3. We set c(1)0 = −1 ,
c(1)1 = c(2)1 = 1 , z(1) = −1 , z(2) = 1 , and Q1 = Q2 = 1.

FIG. 2: For the case of Q1 = Q2 in the dynamical D3-branes, the proper distance between two
dynamical D3-branes given in (51) is depicted. We ﬁx dZ = 3 , c(1)0 = −1, Q1 = Q2 = 1,
z(1) = −1 , z(2) = 1 , and c(1)1 = c(2)1 = 1 for the 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π . The distance decreases, and then
two D3-branes collide each other. The proper distance rapidly vanishes near two branes collide for
the case of θ = 0 , θ = π , θ = 2π .

The angle dependence is the similar to the case of dZ ≤ 1. The proper distance d between
two branes never vanishes. For the case of the equal charges (Q1 = Q2), however, there is

one exceptional case, which is two D3-brane system with the trivial angle (θ = 0 or π). In

this case, as we can see in Figs. 2 and 3, d vanishes just when a singularity appears. Two

D3-branes collide completely and a singularity appears at the same time. Hence we conclude

that two branes will never collide each other except the case with the trivial angles.

How about the diﬀerent values of charges ? We then show the case with diﬀerent magni-

tudes of charges in Fig. 4. In this ﬁgure, we have just shown the case with θ = 0, which may

give the closest distance when a singularity appears. This ﬁgure shows that any two-brane

system with the diﬀerent magnitudes of charges never collide when a singularity appears.

We also show the proper distance between two branes for the case with diﬀerent signs
of charges such that Q1 = 1 and Q2 = −1 in Figs. 5 and 6 . In this case, it describes the
system of the D3-brane and the anti D3-brane with the same masses of M1 = M2 = 1.

Although two branes approach each other, a singularity always appears before two branes

collide. It is diﬀerent from the case with the same charges (Q1 = Q2), in which two branes

can collide when θ = 0 or π. The proper distance d(t, θ) never vanishes for the present case.

z(1) = −1 , z(2) = 1, and c(1)0 = −1. Although the proper distance decreases as t increases, the
distance is still ﬁnite when a singularity appears at t < 0 . (b)We also depict the snapshots at
t = −4 (dashed line), t = −3 (solid line), t = −2 (bold line), and t = −1 (thick bold line). Although
the proper distance decreases as t increases, the distance is still ﬁnite when a singularity appears

This result does not change even if the magnitudes of two charges are diﬀerent, as we show

in Fig. 7.

We then conclude that for the case of dZ = 3, only two-brane system with the same

charges as well as with the trivial angle (θ = 0 or π) gives a complete brane collision.

IV. DISCUSSIONS

In the present paper, we have discussed the dynamical Dp-brane solution which describes

several Dp-branes oriented at angles with respect to one another. Since the corresponding

background ﬁeld conﬁgurations remain largely unexplored, we have presented one such class

of solutions in the time-dependent Dp-brane background. The dynamical solution which we

have obtained in this paper describes any number of Dp-brane whose relative orientations

are given by certain SU(2) rotations. These are functions of time that becomes static near

D-branes with the simplest possible dependence on the warp factor. In the far region from

angled Dp-brane in the ten-dimensional background, the solutions give purely contracting

or expanding uniform universe. The worldvolume of the time-dependent brane is also either

contracting or expanding in ten dimensions depending on the brane dimensions as well as

the sign of c(α)0 except for D3-brane system. The transverse space is always contracting if

c(α)0 < 0.

We have also discussed the dynamics of angled D3-branes models with applications to

collision of branes. The two D3-branes approach at a angle θ in the direction of spatial

part of world volume coordinates yi. We have studied the dynamics of D3-branes which

have been smeared along the transverse space to D3-branes. If two D3-brane charges are
diﬀerent from each other (Q1 = −Q2), the distance between two D3-branes is still ﬁnite
when a singularity appears. Thus, we cannot describe the collision of two D3-branes in
terms of the solution. For dZ ≤ 1, a singularity again appears before D3-branes collide.

21

Then, the topology of the spacetime eventually changes so that branes are separated by

singular hypersurfaces surrounding each D3-brane. This behavior also appears if Q1 = Q2
and dZ = 3. A singularity forms at θ 6= 0 , π , when the distance is still ﬁnite. On the
other hand, it has been shown that there exists a complete collision where the orientation of

conﬁgurations between two smeared D3-branes with Q1 = Q2 are either 0 or π. This result

may be related to supersymmetry, which may be broken for non-paralell branes.

Although the examples presented in the present paper cannot provide a realistic cos-

mological model, the solution may be utilized to construct a cosmological solution just by

introduction of a test brane universe in higher-dimensions. We may also construct new type

of time-dependent black hole solution with non-trivial angles by setting up more complicated

brane conﬁguration. Those subjects are left for a future works.
