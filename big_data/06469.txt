CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS

OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH

ANITA PASOTTI AND MARCO ANTONIO PELLEGRINI

Abstract. The generalization of the Oberwolfach Problem, proposed by J.
Liu in 2000, asks for a uniform 2-factorization of the complete multipartite
graph Km×n. Here we focus our attention on 2-factorizations regular under
the cyclic group Zmn, whose 2-factors are disjoint union of cycles all of even
length ℓ. In particular, we present a complete solution for the extremal cases
ℓ = 4 and ℓ = mn.

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper, Km×n will denote the complete multipartite graph with
m parts of same cardinality n. If n = 1, we may identify Km×1 with the complete
graph on m vertices Km, while K1×n is a union of n disjoint vertices. So from now
we consider Km×n with m, n > 1. Also, note that Km×2 is nothing but the cocktail
party graph K2m − I, namely the graph obtained from K2m by removing a 1-factor
I, that is, a set of m pairwise disjoint edges.

For any graph Γ we write V (Γ) for the set of its vertices and E(Γ) for the set
of its edges. We denote by (c0, c1, . . . , cℓ−1) the cycle of length ℓ whose edges are
[c0, c1], [c1, c2], . . . , [cℓ−1, c0]. An ℓ-cycle system of a graph Γ is a set B of cycles
of length ℓ whose edges partition E(Γ); clearly a graph may admit a cycle system
only if the degree of each its vertex is even.

A 2-factor of a graph Γ is a set of cycles whose vertices partition V (Γ). A
2-factorization of Γ is a set F of 2-factors such that any edge of Γ appears in
exactly one member of F . Hence the cycles appearing in the 2-factors of F form,
altogether, a cycle system of Γ, called the underlying cycle system of F . A 2-
factorization whose 2-factors are all isomorphic to a given 2-factor is said to be
uniform. When the underlying cycle system of F consists of ℓ-cycles, the uniform
2-factorization is called a Cℓ-factorization. In this paper we focus our attention on
the case ℓ even. In particular we deal with the extremal cases: ℓ = 4 and ℓ = mn.
In the second case one speaks of a hamiltonian 2-factorization, since each 2-factor
is a hamiltonian cycle of Km×n.

The problem of ﬁnding 2-factorizations of Km×n is a natural generalization of
the analogous problem for the complete graph, i.e. of the well-known Oberwolfach
Problem (OP) proposed by G. Ringel in 1967. Even if OP has been devoted of an
extensive research activity, the complete solution has not yet been achieved. How-
ever, many partial existence results are known, see [1] and the references therein.
On the other hand very few results have been obtained about 2-factorizations of

Km×n. The generalization of OP to the multipartite case was proposed by J. Liu
in [10]:

“At a gathering there are m delegations each having n people. Is it
possible to arrange a seating of mn people present at s round tables
T1, T2, . . . , Ts (where each Ti can accommodate ℓi ≥ 3 people and

P ℓi = mn) for a suitable number of diﬀerent meals so that each

person has every other person not in the same delegation for a
neighbor exactly once?”

Liu gave a complete solution for the existence of Cℓ-factorizations of Km×n in
[10, 11]. Bryant et al. in [2] completely solved the case of uniform 2-factorizations
of Km×n whose 2-factors are disjoint union of cycles of even length. We point out
that other generalizations of OP have been considered, for example, see [6, 7, 8,
12, 15, 17]. Here we consider Cℓ-factorizations of Km×n regular under the action
of the cyclic group Zmn.

In general, given an additive group G of order v and a graph Γ such that V (Γ) =
G one can consider the regular action of G on V (Γ) deﬁned by x 7→ x + g, for any
x ∈ V (Γ) and any g ∈ G. A 2-factorization F of Γ is said to be regular under the
action of G if for any F ∈ F and any g ∈ G, we have also F + g ∈ F . If G is a cyclic
group a 2-factorization regular under G is simply said cyclic. A natural reason to
looking for a regular 2-factorization F is that this additional property allows to
economize, sometimes considerably, the description of F ; it suﬃces in fact to give
a complete system of representatives for the G-orbits on F rather than to list all
the 2-factors of F .

We point out that OP has been solved in several cases constructing regular 2-
factorizations, for instance see [4, 5, 13]. The 2-factorizations obtained in [2, 10, 11]
concerning the multipartite case do not have this property. In this paper we provide
the ﬁrst inﬁnite classes of regular (in particular cyclic) Cℓ-factorizations of Km×n.
The main results of the paper are the following theorems, that completely solve the
cases ℓ = 4 and ℓ = mn even.

Theorem 1.1. A cyclic C4-factorization of Km×n exists if and only if one of the
following cases occurs:

(a) m, n are both even;
(b) m is odd, n ≡ 0 (mod 4) and (m, n) 6= (pα, 4), where p is a prime.

Theorem 1.2. Let mn be even. A cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×n
exists if and only if all these three conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) n is even;
(b) if n ≡ 2 (mod 4), then m ≡ 1, 2 (mod 4);
(c) if n = 2, then m 6= pα where p is an odd prime.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we give some preliminaries
results and we talk about the concept of a 2-starter which plays a fundamental
role in all our constructions. Then, in Section 3, we provide necessary conditions
for the existence of cyclic Cℓ-factorizations and in Section 4 we introduce some
auxiliary sets and notation which allow us to illustrate the constructions in a simpler
and more elegant way. Sections 5 and 6 contain direct constructions of cyclic
C4-factorizations of Km×n.
In Section 7 there are direct constructions of cyclic
hamiltonian 2-factorizations of Km×n. Finally, in Section 8 we prove Theorems 1.1
and 1.2, using the results of the previous sections.

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 3

2. Preliminaries

As remarked in the Introduction, a necessary condition for the existence of a
2-factorization of Km is m − 1 even. Hence, a C4-factorization of the complete
graph cannot exist.
On the other hand, about cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorizations the following results
are known.

Theorem 2.1. [4] There exists a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km if and
only if m is odd but m 6= 15, pα with p prime and α > 1.

Theorem 2.2. [9] There exists a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×2 if and
only if m ≡ 1, 2 (mod 4) and m 6= pα with p odd prime and α ≥ 1.

Theorem 2.3. [14] Let m be even; a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×n
exists if and only if

(a) n is even, and
(b) if n ≡ 2 (mod 4), then m ≡ 2 (mod 4).

Now, we recall the deﬁnition of a Cayley graph on a ﬁnite group (G, +) with
connection set Ω, denoted by Cay[G : Ω]. Let Ω ⊆ G \ {0} such that for every
ω ∈ Ω we also have −ω ∈ Ω. The Cayley graph Cay[G : Ω] is the graph whose
vertices are the elements of G and in which two vertices are adjacent if and only
if their diﬀerence is an element of Ω. Note that Km×n can be interpreted as the
Cayley graph Cay[Zmn : Zmn \ mZmn], where by mZmn we mean the subgroup of
index m of Zmn. The vertices of Km×n will be always understood as elements of
Zmn and the parts of Km×n are the cosets of mZmn in Zmn.

Given a graph Γ with vertices in G the list of diﬀerences from Γ is the multiset

so deﬁned:

∆Γ = {±(x − y) | [x, y] ∈ E(Γ)}.

More generally, given a collection γ of graphs with vertices in G, by ∆γ we denote
the union (counting multiplicities) of all multisets ∆Γ with Γ ∈ γ.
If Γ is a 2-
regular graph, i.e. a disjoint union of cycles, we can introduce also the list of
partial diﬀerences. For this purpose the following notation will be useful. Let
c0, c1, . . . , cr−1, x be elements of G, with x of order d. The closed trail

C = [c0, c1, c2, . . . , cr−1,

c0 + x, c1 + x, c2 + x, . . . , cr−1 + x, . . . ,

c0 + (d − 1)x, c1 + (d − 1)x, c2 + (d − 1)x, . . . , cr−1 + (d − 1)x]

will be denoted by

Also, we set

[c0, c1, . . . , cr−1]x.

φ(C) = {c0, c1, c2, . . . , cr−1},

∂C = {±(ch+1 − ch) | 0 ≤ h ≤ r − 2} ∪ {±(c0 + x − cr−1)}.

The multiset ∂C is called the list of partial diﬀerences from C.
More generally, given a collection C of cycles with vertices in G, by φ(C) and ∂C one
means the union (counting multiplicities) of all multisets φ(C) and ∂C respectively,
where C ∈ C.
Notice that the closed trail [c0, c1, . . . , cr−1]x is a cycle if and only if the elements
ci, for i = 0, . . . , r − 1, belong to pairwise distinct cosets of the subgroup hxi of G.

Now, let C = (c0, c1, . . . , cℓ−1) be an ℓ-cycle with vertices in G. The stabilizer
of C under the action of G is the subgroup Stab(C) of G deﬁned by Stab(C) =
{g ∈ G : C + g = C}, where C + g is the cycle (c0 + g, c1 + g, . . . , cℓ−1 + g). The
G-orbit of C is the set Orb(C) of all distinct cycles in the collection {C +g : g ∈ G}.
d −1} and ∂C = {±(ch+1 − ch) | 0 ≤ h < ℓ/d}, where
Then φ(C) = {c0, c1, . . . , c ℓ
d = |Stab(C)|. Note that if d = 1 then φ(C) = V (C) and ∂C = ∆C.

As well as many results about regular 1-factorizations of the complete graph
have been obtained using the notion of a starter, see for instance [3, 16, 18], in
this paper we obtain cyclic 2-factorizations of Km×n using a generalization of the
concept of a 2-starter introduced in [5, Deﬁnition 2.3].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let H be a subgroup of G. A 2-starter in G relative to H is a
collection Σ = {S1, . . . , St} of 2-regular graphs with vertices in G satisfying the
following conditions:

(a) ∂S1 ∪ . . . ∪ ∂St = G \ H;
(b) φ(Si) is a left transversal of some subgroup Hi of G containing the stabi-

lizers of all cycles of Si, for i = 1, . . . , t.

Note that if H = {0} we ﬁnd again the deﬁnition given in [5].

The importance of investigating the existence of 2-starters is explained in the fol-
lowing theorem.

Theorem 2.5. Let H be a subgroup of G. The existence of a G-regular 2-factoriza-
tion of K|G:H|×|H| is equivalent to the existence of a 2-starter in G relative to H.

We omit the proof of the previous theorem since it is an easy generalization of
[5, Theorem 2.4]. In the following, we will apply Theorem 2.5 for G = Zmn and
H = mZmn.

3. Necessary conditions for the existence of cyclic Cℓ-factorizations

First of all, we recall that a trivial necessary condition for the existence of a 2-
factorization of Km×n is that the degree (m− 1)n of each vertex is even. Also, since
we have to organize the ℓ-cycles into 2-factors, ℓ must divide |V (Km×n)| = mn.

Remark 3.1. From our hypothesis ℓ even, by the above trivial conditions it follows
that n must be even.

On the other hand, since we are looking for cyclic Cℓ-factorizations we need also
the necessary conditions for the existence of a cyclic ℓ-cycle system of Km×n, given
in [14].

Theorem 3.2. [14, Theorem 3.3] Let n be an even integer. A cyclic ℓ-cycle system
of Km×n cannot exist in each of the following cases:
(a) m ≡ 0 (mod 4) and |ℓ|2 = |m|2 + 2|n|2 − 1;
(b) m ≡ 1 (mod 4) and |ℓ|2 = |m − 1|2 + 2|n|2 − 1;
(c) m ≡ 2, 3 (mod 4), n ≡ 2 (mod 4) and ℓ 6≡ 0 (mod 4);
(d) m ≡ 2, 3 (mod 4), n ≡ 0 (mod 4) and |ℓ|2 = 2|n|2;

where, given a positive integer x, |x|2 denotes the largest e for which 2e divides x.

If the cycles of the system are all hamiltonian, that is ℓ = mn, we obtain the

following corollary.

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 5

Corollary 3.3. Let n be an even integer. A cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of
Km×n cannot exist if both m ≡ 0, 3 (mod 4) and n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

We remark that if ℓ = 4 from Theorem 3.2 we do not obtain non-existence

results. On the other hand we prove the following.

Proposition 3.4. For any odd prime p and any integer α ≥ 1, a cyclic C4-
factorization of Kpα×4 cannot exist.
Proof. In view of Theorem 2.5 we prove that a 2-starter in Z4pα relative to pαZ4pα
does not exist. By way of contradiction, suppose the existence of such a 2-starter
Σ. Consider d = 4pα−1. By item (a) of Deﬁnition 2.4, there exists S ∈ Σ such that
d ∈ ∂S. In particular, d ∈ ∂C for a suitable 4-cycle C of S. Also, by item (b) of
the same deﬁnition, φ(S) is a transversal for some subgroup H of Z4pα containing
the stabilizers of all cycles of S.

Note that a 4-cycle of type [0]t cannot exist, otherwise t = pα, in contradiction
with item (a) of Deﬁnition 2.4. We point out that this implies that |φ(S)| has to be
even. Since d ∈ ∂C, we may suppose that there are two vertices x, y ∈ φ(S) such
that x − y = d. Recalling that φ(S) is a transversal of H, we obtain that d 6∈ H.

Now, H is a cyclic group, so suppose H = hhi. Hence h ∤ d = 4pα−1 and so
we have three possibilities: h = pα and |H| = 4; h = 2pα and |H| = 2; h = 4pα
and |H| = 1. If |H| ≤ 2, then |φ(S)| ≥ 2pα which implies the absurd |∂S| ≥ 4pα.
So |H| = 4 and |φ(S)| = pα, which is impossible because, as previously remarked,
|φ(S)| must be even.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.5. If there exists a cyclic C4-factorization of Km×n then the following
conditions hold:

(a) n is even;
(b) n ≡ 0 (mod 4) if m is odd;
(c) n 6= 4 if m = pα for some odd prime p.

4. Auxiliary sets and notation

In order to give a uniform construction of cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n for
any choice of admissible values of m and n, it is convenient to ﬁx some notations
and deﬁne auxiliary sets we will use in the present paper.

Given k ∈ Z we denote by kkk the set

kkk =(cid:26) {0, 1, 2, . . . , k} ⊂ N if k ≥ 0,

if k < 0.

∅

Furthermore, if a, b ∈ Z and I ⊆ Z, then a + bI denotes the subset {a + bi : i ∈ I}.
According to this notation, when I = ∅, then a + bI = ∅. For instance, 2 + 5 k3k is
the arithmetic progression {2, 7, 12, 17}.

Our method for constructing cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n is the following.

We ﬁrst construct sets L = {[ai, bi] : i ∈ IL} of edges with ai, bi ∈ (cid:13)(cid:13) mn
in such a way that the largest possible number of even integers in (cid:13)(cid:13) mn

appears in exactly one set ∆L = {±(ai − bi) : i ∈ IL}. Starting from the sets
of edges previously described, we construct 2-regular graphs (cid:3)L, whose connected
components are 4-cycles, as follows. Let

4 − 1(cid:13)(cid:13)
4 (cid:13)(cid:13) \ mZ

(cid:3)L = [i∈IL

[ai, bi]ai+ mn

2

and deﬁne φ(L) = φ((cid:3)L). Notice that

2

− ∆L(cid:17) .

Then, we deal with the remaining even integers (if they exist). Next, we consider

∂((cid:3)L) = (∆L) ⊔(cid:16) mn
4 − 1(cid:13)(cid:13) \ mZ, not appearing in the sets of partial diﬀerences
4 − 1(cid:13)(cid:13) \ mZ consisting of odd integers, we deﬁne for all d ∈ D, the graph
2 − d(cid:9) and that φ(Sd) is a transversal

. Observe that ∂Sd = ±(cid:8)d, mn

the odd integers in (cid:13)(cid:13) mn
D ⊆(cid:13)(cid:13) mn

of the 2-regular graphs, previously constructed. More precisely, given a subset

2

Sd = [0, d] mn
of the subgroup of index 2 in Zmn. Finally, we set
D⋆ = {Sd : d ∈ D} .

We will show that the set Σ of the constructed 2-regular graphs is a 2-starter in
Zmn relative to mZmn. The existence of a cyclic C4-factorization of Km×n follows
from Theorem 2.5.

5. Cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n, m even

In this section, we construct cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n for m even. We

recall that also n must be even.

It is convenient to ﬁx some notation we will use in the next propositions. For

any k, v ∈ N let

Yk(2, I) = ∅,

Yk(2v + 2, I) = {[v − 1 − i, v + 1 + i + km] : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I}
Yk(2v + 1, I) = {[v − i, v + 1 + i + km] : i ∈ kvk \ I}.

if v ≥ 1,

It is easy to see that

∆Yk(2v + 2, I) = {2 + 2i + km : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I},
∆Yk(2v + 1, I) = {1 + 2i + km : i ∈ kvk \ I},
φ(Y0(2v + 2, ∅)) = k2vk \ {v},
φ(Y0(2v + 1, ∅)) = k2v + 1k .

Also, for ﬁxed k ≥ 0 and v ≥ 1, let

Yk(4v) = Yk(4v, {0}) ∪ {[2v − 1, 2v + km], [2v − 2, 4v − 1 + km]};

Yk(4v + 2) = Yk(4v + 2, ∅) ∪ {[2v, 4v + 1 + km]}.

Hence, if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) then

∆Yk(m) = ±(cid:16)4 + km + 2(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

and if m ≡ 2 (mod 4), m > 2, then

In both cases, φ(Yk(m)) is a transversal of the subgroup of index m of Zmn.

Finally, deﬁne also the 4-cycle

Notice that ∂Zk = ∆Zk = ±(cid:8)2 + km, 3 + km, mn

that, when m ≡ 0 (mod 4), φ(Zk) is a transversal of the subgroup of index 4 of
Zmn.

Proposition 5.2. For all even integers m, n, there exists a cyclic C4-factorization
of Km×n.

Proof. We split the proof into ﬁve subcases according to the congruence class of m
modulo 8 and n modulo 4. In view of Lemma 5.1 we may assume m > 4.
Case 1: m, n ≡ 0 (mod 4). Let m ≥ 8 and n = 4t + 4. Let D be the set of the odd

Case 4: m ≡ 0 (mod 8) and n ≡ 2 (mod 4). Let n = 4t + 2. Suppose ﬁrstly m = 8.
In this case, let D = (7 + 8 kt − 1k) ∪ {8t + 1} and deﬁne

Σ = {[0]2n} ∪ {Zk : k ∈ ktk} ∪ {(cid:3)Yk(8) : k ∈ kt − 1k} ∪ D⋆.

Now, suppose m ≥ 16. Let S0 = [0] mn
S4(k) = Zk and for k ∈ kt − 1k take S6(k) = (cid:3)Yk(m). Observe that φ(S2) is a

In all these ﬁve cases, SS∈Σ ∂S = Zmn − mZmn and hence Σ is a 2-starter in

struct the sets necessary to obtain the 2-starter for a choice of m and n.
Case 1: Let m = 16 and n = 8, hence t = 1. We obtain D = (1 + 2 k15k) \
{1, 3, 9, 17, 19, 25} and

Z0 = (0, 2, −1, 61),

Z1 = (0, 18, −1, 45),

Y0(16) = {[5, 9], [4, 10], [3, 11], [2, 12], [1, 13], [0, 14]} ∪ {[7, 8], [6, 15]},
Y1(16) = {[5, 25], [4, 26], [3, 27], [2, 28], [1, 29], [0, 30]} ∪ {[7, 24], [6, 31]}.

Case 2: Let m = 6 and n = 12, hence t = 2. We obtain D = (1 + 2 k8k) \ {3, 9, 15}
and

Y0(6) = {[1, 3], [0, 4]} ∪ {[2, 5]},

Y1(6) = {[1, 9], [0, 10]} ∪ {[2, 11]},

Case 3: Let m = 10 and n = 6, hence t = 1. We obtain

Y2(6) = {[1, 15], [0, 16]} ∪ {[2, 17]}.

S0 = {[1, 13]31, [0, 14]30, [2]17}, Y0(10) = {[3, 5], [2, 6], [1, 7], [0, 8]} ∪ {[4, 9]}

and D = (1 + 2 k6k) \ {5}.
Case 4: Let m = 32 and n = 6, hence t = 1. We obtain S0 = [0]48,

Y1(16) = {[5, 41], [4, 42], [3, 43], [2, 44], [1, 45], [0, 46]} ∪ {[7, 40], [6, 47]},

Z0 = (0, 2, −1, 93),

Z1 = (0, 34, −1, 61),

Y0(32) = {[13, 17], [12, 18], [11, 19], [10, 20], [9, 21], [8, 22], [7, 23], [6, 24], [5, 25],

[4, 26], [3, 27], [2, 28], [1, 29], [0, 30]} ∪ {[15, 16], [14, 31]}.

Hence D = (1 + 2 k23k) \ {1, 3, 17, 33, 35, 41}.
Case 5: Let m = 12 and n = 6, hence t = 1. We obtain S0 = [0]18,

Y1(6) = {[1, 15], [0, 16]} ∪ {[2, 17]},

Z0 = (0, 2, −1, 33),

Y0(12) = {[3, 7], [2, 8], [1, 9], [0, 10]} ∪ {[5, 6], [4, 11]}.

Hence D = (1 + 2 k8k) \ {1, 3, 7, 15}.

6. Cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n, m odd

In this section, we construct cyclic C4-factorizations of Km×n for m odd. By

Corollary 3.5 we have that n ≡ 0 (mod 4).

In order to explain our constructions, we need to deﬁne some other auxiliary

sets. For any v, k ∈ N and any subset I ⊂ N we deﬁne

X e
X o
X e
X o

k (4v + 2, I) = {[2v − 2 − 2i, 2v + 2i + km] : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I},
k (4v + 2, I) = {[2v − 1 − 2i, 2v + 3 + 2i + km] : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I},
k (4v + 4, I) = {[2v − 2 − 2i, 2v + 2 + 2i + km] : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I},
k (4v + 4, I) = {[2v + 1 − 2i, 2v + 3 + 2i + km] : i ∈ kvk \ I}.

Notice that

k (4v + 4, I) = ±{4 + 4i + km : i ∈ kv − 1k \ I},
k (4v + 4, I) = ±{2 + 4i + km : i ∈ kvk \ I},

Proposition 6.1. For any m odd and any n ≡ 0 (mod 8) there exists a cyclic
C4-factorization of Km×n.

Proof. We split the proof into two subcases according to the congruence class of n
modulo 16.
Case 1: n ≡ 0 (mod 16). Let n = 16t + 16, whence mn
4 = 4m(t + 1) = 4v + 4, i.e.
0 ( mn
v = m(t + 1) − 1. We start removing from the sets X e
4 , ∅) the
edges [a, b] such that b − a is a multiple of m. First, take X e
4 , ∅): we have to
remove the edges giving the diﬀerence 4 + 4i = αm for some α ∈ N. Clearly α ≡ 0
(mod 4) and so, setting α = 4j + 4, from 4 + 4i = (4j + 4)m we get i = m − 1 + jm.
Since i ∈ kv − 1k, it turns out that we have to remove the edges [2v−2−2i, 2v+2+2i]

with i ∈ I = m − 1 + m(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:4) v−m

are the elements of the set (2m − 2 + 2m kt − 1k) ∪ (2mt + 4m − 2 + 2m kt − 1k)
which coincides with the set (2m − 2 + 2m k2tk) \ {2mt + 2m − 2}.

m (cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:13) = m − 1 + m kt − 1k. So, the vertices we removed

Now, take X o

some α ∈ N. Clearly α ≡ 2 (mod 4). Setting α = 4j + 2, from 2 + 4i = (4j + 2)m
we get i = m−1
2 + jm. Since i ∈ kvk, it turns out that we have to remove the edges
[2v + 1 − 2i, 2v + 3 + 2i] with i ∈ I = m−1
2 + m ktk. So, the
vertices we removed are the elements of the set (m+2m ktk)∪(2mt+3m+2m ktk) =
m + 2m k2t + 1k.

∂A = ± (m + 2 + 4m ktk) ∪ ± (3m − 2 + 4m ktk)

we obtain

and

φ(A) = (2m − 2 + 2m k2t + 1k) ∪ (m + 2m k2t + 1k).

Let now B = X (4v + 4) ∪ A, whence φ(B) =(cid:13)(cid:13) mn

Indeed ∂S0 ∪ (∪d∈D∂Sd) = Zmn \ mZmn and φ(S0) is a transversal of the subgroup
of index mn

remove the edges giving the diﬀerence 2 + 4i = αm for some α ∈ N. Clearly α ≡ 2
(mod 4) and so, setting α = 4j + 2, from 2 + 4i = (4j + 2)m we get i = m−1

Since i ∈ kv − 1k, it turns out that we have to remove the edges [2v − 2 − 2i, 2v + 2i]
with i ∈ I = m−1
2 +m kt − 1k. So, the vertices we removed
are the elements of the set (2m − 2 + 2m kt − 1k) ∪ (2m − 2 + 2mt + 2m kt − 1k)
which coincides with the set (2m − 2 + 2m k2t − 1k).

Now take X o

4 , ∅): we remove the edges giving the diﬀerence 4 + 4i = αm for
some α ∈ N. Clearly α ≡ 0 (mod 4). Setting α = 4j + 4, from 4 + 4i = (4j + 4)m
we get i = m − 1 + jm. Since i ∈ kv − 1k, it turns out that we have to remove the

edges [2v − 1 − 2i, 2v + 3 + 2i] with i ∈ I = m − 1 + m(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:4) v−m

So, the vertices we removed are the elements of the set (m + 2m kt − 1k) ∪ (2mt +
3m + 2m kt − 1k) = (m + 2m k2tk) \ {m + 2mt}.

∂A = ± (m − 2 + 4m ktk) ∪ ± (3m + 2 + 4m kt − 1k)

we obtain

and

φ(A) = (2m − 2 + 2m k2tk) ∪ (m + 2m k2tk).

Let now B = X (4v + 2) ∪ A, whence φ(B) =(cid:13)(cid:13) mn

relative to mZmn.

Example 6.2. Following the proof of Proposition 6.1 we construct the sets neces-
sary to obtain the 2-starter for two choices of m and n.
Case 1: Let m = 3 and n = 32, hence t = 1 and v = 5. We obtain

B = {[8, 12], [6, 14], [2, 18], [0, 20]} ∪ {[11, 13], [7, 17], [5, 19], [1, 23]}∪

{[9, 16], [3, 22]} ∪ {[10, 15], [4, 21]},

which implies D = {1, 11, 13, 23}.
Case 2: Let m = 5 and n = 40, hence t = 2 and v = 12. We obtain

B = {[22, 24], [20, 26], [16, 30], [14, 32], [12, 34], [10, 36], [6, 40], [4, 42], [2, 44], [0, 46]}∪

{[23, 27], [21, 29], [19, 31], [17, 33], [13, 37], [11, 39], [9, 41], [7, 43], [3, 47], [1, 49]}∪

{[25, 28], [15, 38], [5, 48]} ∪ {[18, 35], [8, 45]},
which gives D = (1 + 2 k24k) \ {3, 5, 15, 17, 23, 25, 35, 37, 43, 45}.

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 11

Lemma 6.3. There exist a cyclic C4-factorization of K15×4 and one of K35×4.

Proof. A 2-starter Σ in Z60 relative to 15Z60 is given by Σ = {S0, S2, S4} ∪ D⋆,
where S0 = (cid:3){[0, 8], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 15], [4, 9]}, S2 = (0, 10, 9, 29) ∪ [1, 8]31, S4 =

A 2-starter Σ in Z140 relative to 35Z140 is given by Σ = {S0, S2, S4, S6, S8} ∪D⋆,
where S0 = (cid:3){[0, 12], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 9], [4, 8], [5, 7], [6, 13]}, S2 = (cid:3){[0, 26], [1, 25],

Proposition 6.4. Let m be an odd integer. There exists a cyclic C4-factorization
of Km×4 if and only if m 6= pα where p is a prime.

Proof. In Proposition 3.4 we have already proved that m 6= pα is a necessary
condition for the existence of a cyclic C4-factorization of Km×4. We now prove the
suﬃciency.

Firstly, write m as a product ab with a < b and gcd(a, b) = 1. In view of Lemma

6.3 we can assume m 6= 15, 35. Now, for all i ∈(cid:13)(cid:13) a−3

2 (cid:13)(cid:13), take the set

Wi = {[b − 2 − j, b + j + 2bi] : j ∈ kb − 2k} ∪ {[b − 1, 2b − 1 + 2bi]}.

Observe that ∆Wi = ±(2 + 2bi + 2 kb − 2k) ∪ ±{2b(i + 1)} and that φ(Wi) is a
transversal of the subgroup of index 2b in Z4m. In particular,

and |B| = b−1

2 . Also, the elements of A are pairwise

We now have to consider four cases, according to the congruence class of a and
b modulo 4. In each of these four cases we start constructing two particular sets of
edges in the following way. Let C be a set of even integers 0 < ck < ab, pairwise
distinct and non-zero modulo 2a, such that N = |C| < a is even. We order such
elements according to the following rule. Consider the euclidean division of ck by
2a and let rk be its the remainder. Take rk0 > rk1 > . . . > rkN −1 and consider the
corresponding elements ck0 , ck1 , . . . , ckN −1. Now let J1 = {[j, j+ckj ] : j ∈ kN − 1k}.
Notice that ∆J1 = ±C and that the elements of φ(J1) are pairwise distinct modulo
2a. The set k2a − 1k \ φ(J1) contains a − N even integers N = x0 < x1 < . . . <
xa−N −1 ≤ 2a − 2 and a − N odd integers N + 1 ≤ ya−N −1 < ya−N −2 < . . . <
y1 < y0 = 2a − 1. Deﬁne J2 = {[xj, yj] : j ∈ ka − N − 1k}. For simplicity, write
the previous edges in the form [zk, wk] with 0 < dk = wk − zk < 2a. Clearly, each
diﬀerence dk appears at most twice in ∆J2. Now, we made the following changes:
(a) if dk1 = dk2 6∈ {b, b − 2a, 3b − 2a}, replace in J2 the edge [zk1, wk1 ] with the

edge [zk1 , wk1 + 2a] (so, we get the diﬀerences dk1 and dk1 + 2a);

(b) if dk1 = dk2 = 3b − 2a (which implies 2a

3 ), replace in J2 the edge
[zk1 , wk1 ] with the edge [zk1, wk1 + 4a] (so, we get the diﬀerences 3b − 2a
and 3b + 2a);

3 < b < 4a

12

A. PASOTTI AND M.A. PELLEGRINI

(c1) if dk = b (which implies b < 2a) appears once in ∆J2, replace in J2 the
edge [zk, wk] with the edge [zk, wk + 2a] (so, we get the diﬀerence b + 2a);
(c2) if dk1 = dk2 = b (which implies b < 2a), replace in J2 the edges [zk1, wk1 ]
and [zk2, wk2 ] with the edges [zk1, wk1 + 2a] and [zk2 , wk2 + 4a] (so, we get
the diﬀerences b + 2a and b + 4a);

(c3) if dk1 = dk2 = b − 2a (which implies 2a < b < 4a), replace in J2 the edge
[zk1 , wk1 ] with the edge [zk1, wk1 + 4a] (so, we get the diﬀerences b − 2a and
b + 2a).

2

Notice that at most one of (c1), (c2) and (c3) can happen and that the new diﬀer-
ences obtained in this process are all less than 6a < ab, since m 6= 15. Call J(C) the
set of edges obtained from J1 ∪ J2 with the previous modiﬁcations. We obtain that
φ(J(C)) is a transversal of the subgroup of index 2a in Z4m and that the elements
of ∆J(C) are pairwise distinct and none of them is an odd multiple of b.

even cardinality M . It follows that F is a subset of B. Let W ′ be the set of edges
by replacing the edge [b − 2 − k, b + k + (a − 3)b] with the edge
obtained from W a−3
[b − 2 − k, b + k + (a − 1)b], whenever fk ≡ 0 (mod 4). Observe that fk ∈ ∆W ′ and

Now, let F = {fk = (a − 1)b + 2 + 2k : k ∈ K}, where K ⊆ (cid:13)(cid:13) b−3
that φ(W ′) = φ(cid:16)W a−3

2 (cid:13)(cid:13) is a set of
2 (cid:17) modulo 2b. After this modiﬁcation, we have to consider
2 − 1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:9), where

the diﬀerences fk − 2b. So, we deﬁne ˜fk = fk − 2b if fk ≡ 0 (mod 4) and ˜fk = fk
otherwise. Let ˜F be the set of such elements ˜fk, that we order as ˜fk0 < ˜fk1 <

Gt = {[0, ˜fk2t], [1, 1 + ˜fk2t+1 ]}. Note that φ(Gt) is a transversal of the subgroup of
index 4 in Z4m and that ∆G(F ) = ± ˜F .
Case 1: a ≡ b ≡ 1 (mod 4). In this case |A| and |B| are both even. We take C = A
and F = B and construct the sets J(A) and G(B). A 2-starter in Z4m relative to
mZ4m can be obtained considering the set

where D is the set of the odd integers in km − 1k not belonging to ∆{Wi, W ′, J(A),
G(B)}.

Case 2: a ≡ b ≡ 3 (mod 4). In this case |A| and |B| are both odd. Let β be an

element of B such that β 6≡ 0, 2bi (mod 2a) for all i ∈(cid:13)(cid:13) a−3

and F = B \ {β} and construct the sets J(C) and G(F ). A 2-starter in Z4m relative
to mZ4m can be obtained considering the set

2 (cid:13)(cid:13). We take C = A∪{β}

Σ =(cid:26)(cid:3)Wi : i ∈(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

where D is the set of the odd integers in km − 1k not belonging to ∆{Wi, W ′, J(C),
G(F )}. Clearly, if a = 3, we have not to consider the sets Wi’s.
Case 3: a ≡ −b ≡ 1 (mod 4). In this case |A| is even and |B| is odd. We take
C = A and F = B \ {ab − 1} and construct the sets J(A) and G(F ). We need
also another set of edges. Let q0 < q1 < . . . < q2a−5 be the elements of the set
k2a − 1k \ {0, a − 2, a − 1, 2a − 1}. Let Q′ be the set of the edges [qj, q2a−5−j + 6a],
where we take [qj, q2a−5−j + 8a] instead of [qj, q2a−5−j + 6a], if q2a−5−j + 6a − qj is
a multiple of b (this can happen at most once).

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 13

If either 1 + 6a or 1 + 8a is a multiple of b, consider the cycle Γ = (0, ab − 1, ab −
2 − 10a, 2ab − 1 − 10a); otherwise let Γ = (0, ab − 1, ab − 2 − 8a, 2ab − 1 − 8a). Notice
that, since m 6= 35, we have 1 + 10a < ab. Let Q be the 2-regular graph (cid:3)Q′ ∪ Γ.
Observe that φ(Q) is a transversal of the subgroup of index 2a in Z4m and that
∆Q contains the even integer ab − 1 and is disjoint from ∆{Wi, W ′, J(A), G(F )}.
A 2-starter in Z4m relative to mZ4m can be obtained considering the set

Σ =(cid:26)(cid:3)Wi : i ∈(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

a − 5

(cid:27) ∪ {(cid:3)W ′, (cid:3)J(A), (cid:3)G(F ), Q} ∪ D⋆,

where D is the set of the odd integers in km − 1k not belonging to ∆{Wi, W ′, J(A),
G(F ), Q}.

Case 4: a ≡ −b ≡ 3 (mod 4). In this case |A| is odd and |B| is even. We take
C = A \ {2b} and F = B and construct the sets J(C) and G(B). Also in this
case, we need another set of edges. Let q0 < q1 < . . . < q2a−5 be the elements of
the set k2a − 1k \ {0, r − 1, r, 2a − 1}, where r is the remainder in the euclidean
division of 2b by 2a. Let Q′ be the set of the edges [qj , q2a−5−j + 6a], where we take
[qj, q2a−5−j + 8a] instead of [qj, q2a−5−j + 6a], if q2a−5−j + 6a − qj is a multiple of
b (this can happen at most once).

If m = 63, i.e. (a, b) = (7, 9), let Γ = (0, 18, 3, 111). Suppose now m 6= 63:

if
either 1 + 6a or 1 + 8a is a multiple of b, let Γ = (0, 2b, 2b − 1 − 10a, 2ab − 1 − 10a);
otherwise let Γ = (0, 2b, 2b − 1 − 8a, 2ab − 1 − 8a). Since m 6= 15, 63, we obtain
1 + 10a < ab. Let Q be the 2-regular graph (cid:3)Q′ ∪ Γ. Notice that φ(Q) is a
transversal of the subgroup of index 2a in Z4m and that ∆Q contains the even
integer 2b and is disjoint from ∆{Wi, W ′, J(C), G(B)}. A 2-starter in Z4m relative
to mZ4m can be obtained considering the set

Σ =(cid:26)(cid:3)Wi : i ∈(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

a − 5

2 (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
(cid:27) ∪ {(cid:3)W ′, (cid:3)J(C), (cid:3)G(B), Q} ∪ D⋆,

where D is the set of the odd integers in km − 1k not belonging to ∆{Wi, W ′, J(C),
G(B), Q}. Clearly, if a = 3, we have not to consider the sets Wi’s and J(C).
(cid:3)

Example 6.5. Let m = 143. Following the proof of Proposition 6.4 we construct
the elements of a 2-starter Σ in Z572 relative to 143Z572. We factorize m as m = ab,
where a = 11 and b = 13 (hence we are in Case 4 of the proof). For any i ∈ k3k let

Wi = {[11 − j, 13 + j + 26i] : j ∈ k11k} ∪ {[12, 25 + 26i]}

and instead of W4 we consider

W ′ = {[0, 128], [1, 127], [2, 126], [3, 125], [4, 124], [5, 123], [6, 122], [7, 147], [8, 120],

[9, 145], [10, 118], [11, 143], [12, 129]}.

We obtain A = {26, 52, 78, 104, 130} and B = {132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142}. Let
C = A \ {26} and construct

J(C) = {[0, 130], [1, 105], [2, 80], [3, 55], [4, 21], [6, 41], [8, 15], [10, 35], [9, 12],

[7, 16], [5, 62]}.

Then we get G(B) = {G0, G1, G2}, where

G0 = {[0, 106], [1, 111]}, G1 = {[0, 114], [1, 135]}, G3 = {[0, 138], [1, 143]}.

(0, 26, 509, 197).

Finally the elements of D are the odd integers of k142k\{3, 7, 9, 13, 17, 25, 35, 39, 57,
65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 83, 85, 89, 91, 117}.

Hence Σ = {(cid:3)W0, (cid:3)W1, (cid:3)W2, (cid:3)W3, (cid:3)W ′, (cid:3)J(C), (cid:3)G(B), Q} ∪ D⋆.

Proposition 6.6. For any m ≡ 1 (mod 4) and any n ≡ 4 (mod 8) with n > 4,
there exists a cyclic C4-factorization of Km×n.

Proof. Let n = 8t + 12. Deﬁne S0 = (cid:3)A where

2 + 2(t + 1)m}, and so φ(S0) is a transversal of

(cid:21)(cid:27) .

Bk = X e

3(m − 1)

2

It is easy to see φ(S2(k)) is a transversal of the subgroup of index 2m of Zmn and
∆Bk = ±(2 + 2km + 2 km − 2k) ∪ ±{m − 2 + 2km}. Let D be the set of the odd

integers in (cid:13)(cid:13) mn

4 − 1(cid:13)(cid:13) \ mZ not belonging to ∆{A, Bk}. Deﬁne

Σ = {S0} ∪ {S2(k) : k ∈ ktk} ∪ D⋆.

We get ∪S∈Σ ∂S = Zmn − mZmn. Hence Σ is a 2-starter in Zmn relative to mZmn.
(cid:3)

Example 6.7. Let m = 9 and n = 12. Following the proof of previous proposition
we obtain A = {[3, 14], [2, 15], [1, 16], [0, 17]} ∪ {[6, 26], [4, 28]} ∪ {[7, 29], [5, 31]} ∪
{[9, 12]} and B0 = {[6, 8], [4, 10], [2, 12], [0, 14]} ∪ {[7, 11], [5, 13], [3, 15], [1, 17]} ∪
{[9, 16]}. Hence, it results D = {1, 5, 19, 21, 23, 25}.

Lemma 6.8. For any n ≡ 4 (mod 8) with n > 4, there exist a cyclic C4-factoriza-

Proposition 6.10. For any m ≡ 3 (mod 4) and any n ≡ 4 (mod 8) with n > 4,
there exists a cyclic C4-factorization of Km×n.

Proof. We split the proof into two subcases according to the congruence class of
m modulo 8. By Lemmas 6.8 and 6.9 we may assume m ≥ 11 and n ≥ 20. Let
n = 8t + 20.
Case 1: m ≡ 3 (mod 8). Firstly, suppose m = 11. If n = 20, deﬁne S0(k) = (cid:3)Ak,
for k = 0, 1, 2, where

A0 = {[0, 18], [4, 14], [6, 12], [8, 10]} ∪ {[1, 21], [5, 17], [7, 15], [9, 13]} ∪

{[11, 20], [2, 25], [16, 19]},

A1 = {[0, 40], [2, 38], [4, 36], [6, 34], [8, 32]} ∪ {[1, 43], [3, 41], [5, 39], [7, 37],

[9, 35]} ∪ {[11, 42]},

A2 = {[0, 54], [1, 53], [2, 52], [3, 51], [4, 50]} ∪ {[11, 64], [12, 63], [13, 62], [14, 61],

[15, 60]} ∪ {[5, 21]}.

Also, deﬁne

S2 = (0, 14, 1, 97) ∪ [2, 9]112 ∪ [3, 8]113 ∪ [5, 6]115.

Notice that φ(S0(k)) and φ(S2) are a transversal of the subgroup of index 22 and of
index 10, respectively, in Z220. It is easy to see that the set Σ = {S0(0), S0(1), S0(2),
S2} ∪ D⋆, where D is the set of the odd integers of k54k \ {11, 33} not appearing
in ∂Si, is a 2-starter in Z220 relative to 11Z220.

So, suppose n > 20. For k ∈ kt + 2k deﬁne S0(k) = (cid:3)Ak where

A0 = X e
Ak = X e

0 (22, {1}) ∪ X o
2k(22, ∅) ∪ X o

for 1 ≤ k ≤ t + 1,

At+2 = Y2t+4(12, ∅) ∪ (11 + Y2t+4(9, ∅)) ∪ {[5, 21]} .

Now let S2 = (cid:3)B ∪ (0, 6, −1, 11n−14

), where

B = Y0 (21, {3, 4, 5, 10}) ∪ {[14, 71], [16, 51]} .

in Z11n relative to 11Z11n.

Notice that φ(S0(k)) and φ(S2) are both transversals of the subgroup of index 22 in
Z11n. One can check that the set Σ = {S0(k) : k ∈ kt + 2k} ∪ {S2} ∪ D⋆, where D

Example 6.11. Let m = 15 and n = 20, hence we are in Case 2 of the proof of
Proposition 6.10. Following such a proof we construct the following sets of edges

A0 = {[12, 14], [10, 16], [8, 18], [6, 20], [4, 22], [0, 26]} ∪

{[13, 17], [9, 21], [7, 23], [5, 25], [3, 27], [1, 29]} ∪ {[2, 41], [19, 54], [15, 28]},

{[13, 47], [11, 49], [9, 51], [7, 53], [5, 55], [3, 57], [1, 59]} ∪ {[15, 58]},

{[21, 82], [20, 83], [19, 84], [18, 85], [17, 86], [16, 87], [15, 88]} ∪ {[7, 29]},

B = {[14, 15], [13, 16], [12, 17], [11, 18], [9, 20], [6, 23], [5, 24], [4, 25], [3, 26],

[2, 27], [1, 28]} ∪ {[7, 40], [22, 79]}.

Hence it results D = {29, 31, 37, 41} ∪ (47 + 2 k4k) ∪ {59}.

7. Existence of a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×n

In this section we consider the existence of a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization
of Km×n with an even number of vertices. By Remark 3.1, n is even and in view
of Theorem 2.3 we can suppose m odd.
Firstly we deal with the case n ≡ 2 (mod 4). By Corollary 3.3, this implies that
m ≡ 1 (mod 4). As observed in the Introduction, Km×2 = K2m − I is the cocktail
party graph; thus we can suppose throughout this section that n > 2, since for
n = 2 we can rely on Theorem 2.2.

The following result will be very useful for our constructions.

Lemma 7.1. Let n ≡ 2 (mod 4). For any odd integer x not divisible by m and
any integer a ≥ 1, [0, x]2a is a hamiltonian cycle of Km×n.

Proof. The thesis immediately follows by [14, Remark 2.3] since the order of 2a in
Zmn is mn
(cid:3)

2 by the hypothesis on m and n.

Remark 7.2. Let n ≡ 2 (mod 4) and let U = {x0, x0+2a0, x1, x1 +2a1, . . . , xb, xb +
2ab} be a set containing odd integers not divisible by m. Then Wu = [0, xu +2au]2au

is a hamiltonian cycle of Km×n for any u ∈ kbk. Obviously, ∂(cid:0)∪b

u=0 Wu(cid:1) = ±U .

The following deﬁnition and lemma are instrumental in proving Theorem 7.5,

where we shall settle the case n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

Deﬁnition 7.3. For all positive integers s, d and all odd integers w ≥ 3, set

R(s, d, w) = s + d(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

w − 3

2 (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

and

ϕ(s, d, w) = |{x ∈ R(s, d, w) : gcd(x, w) = 1}| .

Lemma 7.4. [14, Lemma 4.6] Assume gcd(s, d, w) = 1. If 3 ∤ s when w = 3, then
ϕ(s, d, w) > 0.

Now, we can prove the following.

Proposition 7.5. Let m be an odd integer; let n ≡ 2 (mod 4) and n > 2. Then
there exists a cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×n if and only if m ≡ 1
(mod 4).

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 19

Proof. The non existence immediately follows from Corollary 3.3.
So assume m ≡ 1 (mod 4).
In order to prove the existence we will construct a
2-starter Σ in Zmn relative to mZmn, where each S ∈ Σ is a hamiltonian cycle. We
have to distinguish two cases according to the congruence class of n modulo 8.
Case 1: n = 8t + 10.
For any k ∈ ktk let

(3)

Ak = [0, 4m − 2 + 4km, 2, 4m − 4 + 4km, 4, . . . , 4m − (m − 1) + 4km,

m − 1, 4m − m + 4km, m + 2, 4m − (m + 2) + 4km, m + 4,
4m − (m + 4) + 4km, . . . , 2m − 1, 4m − (2m − 1) + 4km]2m

and

Note that φ(Ak) and φ(B) are transversals of the subgroup of index 2m and of
index m, respectively, of Zmn. Also, we have

∂(cid:18) t

∪
k=0

Ak ∪ B(cid:19) = ± (((2 + 2 k(2t + 2)m − 2k) \ (2m + 2m k2tk)) ∪
2 (cid:27) ∪ ((4t + 4)m + 1 + km − 2k)) .
(1 + 2m k2t + 1k) ∪(cid:26) m + 1

It is easy to see that the number of odd integers of the set Θ =(cid:13)(cid:13) mn

∂(∪kAk ∪ B)) is odd.
Case 1.a: Assume that 3 does not divide m. Consider the set R(2m − 3, 2m, n
2 )
whose elements are all coprime with m. Since gcd(2m − 3, 2m, n
2 ) = 1 and gcd(3,
2m − 3) = 1 we can apply Lemma 7.4. Hence there exists an element κ in R(2m −
3, 2m, n
2 . So κ is coprime with mn and C = [0]κ is a hamiltonian
cycle of Km×n.

2 (cid:13)(cid:13) \ (m(cid:13)(cid:13) n
2(cid:13)(cid:13) ∪

2 ) coprime with n

If m ≥ 13, then the set Θ \ {κ} satisﬁes the condition of Remark 7.2, so we

construct the associated cycles Wu.

The case m = 5 (and hence 2m − 3 = 7) requires a special analysis. If n = 10
take the cycles D0 = [0, 9]2, D1 = [0, 19]2 and, instead of C = [0]κ, take C = [0]13.
It is easy to see that Σ = {A0, B, C, D0, D1} is a 2-starter in Z50 relative to 5Z50.
So we can suppose n ≥ 18. If κ = 20j + 7 with j ∈ ktk the elements of Θ \ {κ}
can be partitioned into 2 sets Θ+ and Θ− of even size containing respectively the
elements of Θ greater than κ and the elements of Θ less than κ. Note that if κ = 7
then Θ− is empty. The sets Θ+ and Θ− satisfy the hypothesis of Remark 7.2, and
hence we construct the cycles Wu as in the remark.

If κ = 10(2j + 1) + 7 with j ∈ kt − 1k take D0 = [0, κ + 10]8, D1 = [0, κ + 12]16,
D2 = [0, κ + 20]4 and D3 = [0, κ + 22]16, which are hamiltonian cycles by Lemma
7.1. The elements of Θ\∂ (C ∪ (∪iDi)) can be partitioned into 2 sets Θ+ and Θ− of
even size containing respectively the elements of Θ greater than κ and the elements
of Θ less than κ. Reasoning as above, we can construct the cycles Wu as in Remark
7.2.

Finally, if κ = 10(2j + 1) + 7 with j = t take D0 = [0, κ − 20]4, D1 = [0, κ − 10]8,
D2 = [0, κ − 4]4 and D3 = [0, κ + 2]16, which are hamiltonian cycles by Lemma 7.1.
The set Θ \ ∂ (C ∪ (∪iDi)) is of even size and satisﬁes the conditions of Remark
7.2, so we construct the cycles Wu.

2 ) whose elements are all coprime with m. Since gcd(2m − 1, 2m, n

Case 1.b: Assume that 3 divides m (which implies m ≥ 9). Consider the set R(2m−
1, 2m, n
2 ) = 1
and gcd(3, 2m − 1) = 1 we can apply Lemma 7.4. Hence there exists an element κ
in R(2m − 1, 2m, n
2 . So κ is coprime with mn and C = [0]κ is a
hamiltonian cycle of Km×n.

2 ) coprime with n

If κ = 4m − 1 + 4jm with j ∈ ktk the elements of Θ \ {κ} can be partitioned, as
above, into 2 sets Θ+ and Θ− of even size. Hence we construct the cycles Wu as in
Remark 7.2.

If κ = 2m − 1 + 4jm with j ∈ ktk take D0 = [0, κ + 6]8. Note that the set
Θ \ ∂ (C ∪ D) can be divided into sets of even size which satisfy the conditions of
Remark 7.2. So, again, we construct the cycles Wu.

In both cases 1.a and 1.b, Σ = {Ai, B, C, Dv, Wu} is a 2-starter in Zmn relative

to mZmn.
Case 2: n = 8t + 6.
Take

(5)

A = [0, 2m − 2, 2, 2m − 4, 4, . . . , m + 1, m − 1]m,

B as in (4) and for any k ∈ kt − 1k take

(6)

Ck = [0, 6m − 2 + 4km, 2, 6m − 4 + 4km, 4, . . . , 5m + 1 + 4km,

m − 1, 5m + 4km, m + 2, 5m − 2 + 4km, m + 4, . . . ,
2m − 1, 4m + 1 + 4km]2m.

Note that

Λ = ∂(A ∪ B ∪ ∪kCk) = ± (((2 + 2 km(2t + 1) − 2k) \ (2m + 2m k2t − 1k)) ∪

(1 + 2m k2tk) ∪(cid:26) m + 1

2 (cid:27) ∪ (1 + 2m(2t + 1) + km − 2k)(cid:19) .

One can check that (cid:13)(cid:13) mn

2 (cid:13)(cid:13) \ (mZ ∪ Λ) is a set satisfying the hypothesis of Remark

7.2. So we construct the cycles Wu.

It is not hard to see that Σ = {A, B, Ck, Wu} is a 2-starter in Zmn relative to
(cid:3)

mZmn.

Example 7.6. Following the proof of Theorem 7.5, we construct a 2-starter Σ in
Zmn relative to mZmn for some choice of m and n.
Case 1.a: Let m = 5 and n = 18. We obtain

A0 = [0, 18, 2, 16, 4, 15, 7, 13, 9, 11]10, A1 = [0, 38, 2, 36, 4, 35, 7, 33, 9, 31]10,

B = [0, 44, 1, 43, 2]5.

It results ∂(A0 ∪ A1 ∪ B) = ± (((2 + 2 k18k) \ {10, 20, 30}) ∪ {1, 11, 21, 31} ∪ {3}
∪{41, 42, 43, 44}) hence Θ = {7, 9, 13, 17, 19, 23, 27, 29, 33, 37, 39}. Note that Θ has
odd size. Since 3 does not divide m we consider R(7, 10, 9) = {7, 17, 27, 37}. We
can choose for instance κ = 17 which is coprime with n
2 = 9, so we take C = [0]17.
Now we have to take the cycles D0 = [0, 27]8, D1 = [0, 29]16, D2 = [0, 37]4 and
D3 = [0, 39]16. It results Θ \ ∂ (C ∪ (∪iDi)) = {7, 9}. So in this case Θ+ = ∅. It
remains to consider only the cycle W0 = [0, 9]2. Hence take Σ = {Ai, B, C, Dv, W0}.
Case 1.b: Let m = 9 and n = 26. We obtain

A0 = [0, 34, 2, 32, 4, 30, 6, 28, 8, 27, 11, 25, 13, 23, 15, 21, 17, 19]18,

CYCLIC UNIFORM 2-FACTORIZATIONS OF THE COMPLETE MULTIPARTITE GRAPH 21

A1 = [0, 70, 2, 68, 4, 66, 6, 64, 8, 63, 11, 61, 13, 59, 15, 57, 17, 55]18,

A2 = [0, 106, 2, 104, 4, 102, 6, 100, 8, 99, 11, 97, 13, 95, 15, 93, 17, 91]18,

B = [0, 116, 1, 115, 2, 114, 3, 113, 4]9.

We have ∂(∪iAi ∪ B) = ±(((2 + 2 k52k) \ {18, 36, 54, 72, 90}) ∪ {1, 19, 37, 55, 73, 91}
∪{5} ∪ (109 + k7k)). Hence Θ = (1 + 2 k53k) \ {1, 5, 9, 19, 27, 37, 45, 55, 63, 73, 81, 91,
99}. Since 3 divides m we consider R(17, 18, 13) = {17, 35, 53, 71, 89, 107}. All
the elements of R(17, 18, 13) are coprime with n
2 . The more convenient choices
are 35, 71 or 107 since in each of these cases we have not to construct the cycle
D0. Choosing κ = 107, we have to take C = [0]107 and following Remark 7.2,
we construct W0 = [0, 7]4, W1 = [0, 13]2, W2 = [0, 17]2, W3 = [0, 23]2, W4 =
[0, 29]4, W5 = [0, 33]2, W6 = [0, 39]4, W7 = [0, 43]2, W8 = [0, 49]2, W9 = [0, 53]2,
W10 = [0, 59]2, W11 = [0, 65]4, W12 = [0, 69]2, W13 = [0, 75]4, W14 = [0, 79]2,
W15 = [0, 85]2, W16 = [0, 89]2, W17 = [0, 95]2, W18 = [0, 101]4, W19 = [0, 105]2.
Hence take Σ = {Ai, B, C, Wu}.
Case 2: Let m = 13 and n = 14. We obtain

A = [0, 24, 2, 22, 4, 20, 6, 18, 8, 16, 10, 14, 12]13,

B = [0, 90, 1, 89, 2, 88, 3, 87, 4, 86, 5, 85, 6]13,

C0 = [0, 76, 2, 74, 4, 72, 6, 70, 8, 68, 10, 66, 12, 65, 15, 63, 17, 61, 19, 59, 21, 57,

23, 55, 25, 53]26.

It results Λ = ∂(A∪B∪C0) = ±(((2+2 k37k)\{26, 52})∪{1, 7, 27, 53}∪(79+k11k)).
Hence we are left to consider k91k \ (13Z ∪ Λ) = (3 + 2 k37k) \ {7, 13, 27, 39, 53, 65}.
Now, following Remark 7.2, we construct the cycles W0 = [0, 5]2, W1 = [0, 11]2,
W2 = [0, 17]2, W3 = [0, 21]2, W4 = [0, 25]2, W5 = [0, 31]2, W6 = [0, 35]2, W7 =
[0, 41]4, W8 = [0, 45]2, W9 = [0, 49]2, W10 = [0, 55]4, W11 = [0, 59]2, W12 = [0, 63]2,
W13 = [0, 69]2, W14 = [0, 73]2, W15 = [0, 77]2. Hence take Σ = {A, B, C0, Wu}.

Now we consider the case n ≡ 0 (mod 4).

Proposition 7.7. Let m be an odd integer; for any n ≡ 0 (mod 4) there exists a
cyclic hamiltonian 2-factorization of Km×n.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst consider the case n = 4. Take A as in (5) so that ∂A =
± ({1} ∪ (2 + 2 km − 2k)).

and C = [0]2m−1. Note that gcd(2m − 1, 4m) = 1. In both cases Σ = {A, C, Fj} is
a 2-starter in Z4m relative to mZ4m.

Suppose now n ≥ 8. We split the proof into two similar cases according to the

congruence class of m modulo 4.

8. Proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2

Proof of Theorem 1.1. “⇒” It is Corollary 3.5.
“⇐” Case (a) is settled in Proposition 5.2. Case (b) is considered in Propositions
6.1, 6.4, 6.6 and 6.10.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. “⇒” It is suﬃcient to apply Theorem 2.2, Remark 3.1 and
Corollary 3.3.
“⇐” It follows from Theorem 2.3 and Propositions 7.5 and 7.7.
