The diagonal entropy was introduced as a good entropy candidate especially for isolated quantum
systems out of equilibrium. Here we present an analytical calculation of the average diagonal
entropy for systems undergoing unitary evolution and an external perturbation in the form of a
cyclic quench. We compare our analytical ﬁndings with numerical simulations of various many-
body quantum systems. Our calculations elucidate various heuristic relations proposed recently in
the literature.

The precision for manipulating quantum systems at-
tained to date has led to the next big question: how do
basic thermodynamics principles operate at very small
scales. Motivated by this question an ever growing ef-
fort has surged attempting to describe quantum thermo-
dynamics of small isolated quantum systems, and their
approach to equilibrium and subsequent thermalization.
The incredible advance in experimental techniques allow-
ing to follow the time evolution of closed quantum sys-
tems [1] has been the main boost of these endeavors. The
relevance of this subject is (at least) twofold. On the one
hand, quantum technologies (e.g. for quantum informa-
tion [2] and quantum simulation [3]) tend to be based
on systems with negligible interaction with the environ-
ment. On the other hand, a complete microscopic ther-
modynamical description of these advances in nonequi-
librium statistical mechanics of such quantum systems
has remained elusive, in part due to the lack of a suit-
able deﬁnition of entropy. Although the von Neumann
entropy SvN = −trρ ln ρ (with kB = 1) is a natural tool
to measure the entropy of a quantum state ρ, it cannot be
used to describe the approach to equilibrium of isolated
quantum systems, since they undergo unitary dynamics.
As an alternative the diagonal entropy (DE)

SD = −(cid:88)

ρnn ln ρnn

(1)

n

was proposed [4], where ρnn are the diagonal elements of
the density matrix in the energy eigenbasis. The DE pos-
sesses most of the expected features of a thermodynamic
entropy, such as additivity, or increase when a system
at equilibrium undergoes an external perturbation [4, 5].
The DE appears to be a fundamental quantity, which
can describe the behavior of a very broad class of out-of-
equilibrium systems. Clarifying the universality or the
speciﬁcities of its properties is therefore an important
goal.

Two universal properties of DE have been proposed
recently. In the case where a system is perturbed by an
external operation during a time τ, one can study the
DE as a function of the duration τ of the perturbation.
In [5] a conjecture was made introducing bounds on the
diﬀerence between the time averaged DE, SD(τ ), and the
DE of the time averaged state ρ(τ ) (denoted as S
),

ρ(τ )

namely

0 ≤ ∆S ≤ 1 − γ, where ∆S def= S

ρ(τ )

− SD(τ )

(2)

and γ = 0.5772 . . . is Euler’s constant. A second property
was numerically uncovered in [6], where a universal re-
lation was found between ∆S and a quantity measuring
localization of the initial state.

The aim of this Letter is to provide analytical sup-
port to both of these observations and to determine to
which extent they are universal. To this end, we derive
an analytical expression for ∆S as an expansion in terms
of average generalized participation ratios (PR), which
characterize the localization properties of the vector of
transition probabilities between the initial and the per-
turbed eigenstates. Using perturbation theory, we an-
alyze the behavior of the ﬁrst terms of this expansion
in the two extreme regimes of localized and delocalized
states. To support our analytical ﬁndings we performed
numerical simulations using two representative physical
models displaying chaotic and integrable regimes. We
show that our truncated expansion of ∆S is accurate in-
dependently of the physical model and of the localization
properties of the eigenfunctions.

The importance of our results is twofold. They pro-
vide a precise analytical value for the time average of
SD and ∆S, improving [5], and giving a tighter bound.
Moreover, they relate the DE to localization properties
of eigenstates of the perturbed system by an explicit and
accurate expression. This should lead to a better under-
standing of the deep connections between Anderson-type
transitions and equilibration characterized by the DE.
It is noteworthy that the DE is uniquely related to the
energy distribution [4] and it is thus (in principle) a mea-
surable quantity. Therefore, it could be relevant in the
experimental description of equilibration and thermaliza-
tion processes which have gained so much attention due
to a ﬂurry of recent breakthroughs (see [7–14] to name
but a few).

For simplicity we consider a cyclic external operation,
where a system, described by a Hamiltonian H = H(λ)
depending on a ﬁxed parameter λ, undergoes a sudden
quench H → H(cid:48) = H(λ + δλ) at time t = 0 and is then
reverted to the Hamiltonian H at time τ. If H is time-
independent, the DE SD(t) of the state ρ(t) is constant

n

Mn(t) =

for t > τ.
It can thus be studied as a function of the
perturbation duration τ, and denoted SD(τ ). For large
enough τ, the system evolving under Hamiltonian H(cid:48) will
have the time to equilibrate, so that SD(τ ) goes to a
constant value that can be estimated by considering the
average SD(τ ). Let us label by |n(cid:105) the basis of normalized
eigenvectors of H (with eigenvalues En), and by |m(cid:105) the
basis of eigenvectors of H(cid:48) (with eigenvalues E(cid:48)
m). We
may consider ﬁnite systems of size N, or truncate our
matrices to a Hilbert space of dimension N. We assume
that at t = 0 the system is in an eigenstate |n0(cid:105)(cid:104)n0| of
H with energy En0. Let U = e−iH(cid:48)τ (  def= 1) be the
evolution operator from time 0 to τ. At time τ the state
is ρ(τ ) = U|n0(cid:105)(cid:104)n0|U†. Its DE can be expressed as
hn = |(cid:104)n|U|n0(cid:105)|2,

SD(τ ) = −(cid:88)

hn ln hn,

(3)

(cid:80)

where hn is the probability to observe the system in
an eigenstate |n(cid:105) at time τ (we have the normalization

Since hn ∈ [0, 1] has ﬁnite support, the knowledge of all
its moments uniquely deﬁnes its distribution P (hn), from
which it is possible to calculate ∆S. Using

to 0 otherwise. From Eq. (6), keeping only terms with

Recalling that (cid:80)

ξ2,

n hn = 1, the quantity ξ2 appears as
the average over PRs (9) weighted by the mean tran-
sition probability hn to go from |n0(cid:105) to |n(cid:105) during the
quench. This ﬁrst resul, Eq. (13), has two consequences.
First, it makes a more precise statement than the con-
jecture ∆S ≤ 1 − γ of (2) by showing that for ﬁnite
dimension N, as the value of ξ2 is ﬁnite, the inequality
∆S < 1 − γ is strictly fullﬁlled. Moreover, while the
equality ∆S = 1 − γ was proved in [5] under some as-
sumptions on the localization properties and in the limit
N → ∞, our result provides a value for the ﬁrst correc-
tion to the diﬀerence between ∆S and its upper bound in
the ﬁnite N case. The second consequence of Eq. (13) is
that it relates the DE to the average PRs of the overlaps
cmn, substantiating the observations of [6].

In Eq. (10) we only kept the ﬁrst two terms in the
k. It is in fact possible
expression of the moments hk
to systematically carry out the calculation by keeping
successive terms in the expression of the moments, as
we show in the Supplemental material. This yields an

The collective angular momentum operators Jz, J± cor-
respond to a pseudospin j = ns/2, and a† (a) are creation
(annihilation) operators of the ﬁeld. The DM undergoes
a superradiant quantum phase transition in the thermo-
dynamic limit (ns → ∞) at λc =
ω0ω/2 [16]. For ﬁnite
ns, there is a transition from Poissonian to Wigner-Dyson
level spacing statistics at λ ≈ λc. This marks a transition
from quasi-integrability at small λ to quantum chaos at
large λ, as is veriﬁed using a semiclassical model in [17].
In our calculations we consider ω = ω0 = 1 (λc = 0.5)
and the quench is implemented by changing λ → λ + δλ.
The second model is a quantum smallworld (SW) sys-
tem with disorder [18, 19]. This is a one-dimensional
tight-binding Anderson model having N = 2nr sites, with
nearest-neighbor interaction and periodic boundary con-
ditions, to which p N shortcut links between sites are
added, connecting p N random pairs of vertices. The
Hamiltonian which describes the quantum version of this
system is

over nearest-neighbors, while the third term describes

with the usual one-dimensional Anderson model where all
states are known to be localized with localization length
l ∼ 1/W 2 for small W [20]. The presence of long-range
interacting pairs for p > 0 induces a delocalization tran-
sition from localized states for large W to delocalized

This expression is the main result of this work. It pro-
vides a connection between the average DE and the
structure of the eigenfunctions – localization on the per-
turbed basis – through the generalized PR (9).
It is
all the more accurate that the higher-order terms are
negligible (which typically is the case in the delocalized
regime, as we discuss below). To distinguish these dif-
ferent orders it will be useful to introduce the quantities
O1 = 1 − γ − ξ2/4, O2 = O1 + (ξ3/9 + ξ22/16) and
O3 = O2 − (11ξ4/96 + ξ32/6 + ξ222/16).
To test the consistency of our analytical results we
study two diﬀerent models. Both of them undergo a
localization-delocalization transition when varying one
parameter. The ﬁrst model is the Dicke model (DM) [15]
describing the dipole interaction of a single mode of a
bosonic ﬁeld, of frequency ω, with ns two-level particles,
with level splitting ω0. The corresponding Hamiltonian

implemented by keeping the shortcut links (ik, jk) ﬁxed
and changing W → W − δW .
To compute ∆S we fully diagonalize H and H(cid:48) to cal-
culate the hn and perform the average (4) over a window
[τ, τ + ∆τ ] for a very large τ. Examples of S
and
SD(τ ) are plotted in the inset of Fig. 1. In the case of
the DM, we take into account the parity symmetry, and
we truncate the phonon basis to a ﬁnite size Nt (we only
consider energies well inside the converged part of the
spectrum).

ρ(τ )

In Fig. 1 we show ∆S for the DM as a function of the
coupling strength λ for two diﬀerent initial states. At
large λ (delocalized regime), order O1 already approxi-
mates ∆S rather well. At small λ (localized regime), O1
and O2 tend to a constant value corresponding to the
fully localized case ξµ → 1, while O3 matches ∆S very
well. The higher the energy, the smaller the localized
plateau is, as illustrated in Fig. 1; this can be understood
by the fact that the quench induces more transitions at
higher energies (see also [6]). In Fig. 2 we present similar
results for the SW model: in the delocalized (small-W )
regime, order O1 gives again a good approximation of
∆S, while in the localized regime O3 gives a very good
approximation for ∆S. Note that Fig. 2 corresponds to
a single disorder and shortcut link realization (we have
checked that the results are equivalent for any realization
with suﬃciently large ∆τ).

of mean return probabilities(cid:80)

In order to understand these features, we consider two
limiting situations. When equilibrium is reached ‘ide-
ally’, the eigenvectors |m(cid:105) of H(cid:48) are uniformly spread
(i. e. delocalized) in the |n(cid:105) basis, thus each overlap is
|(cid:104)m|n(cid:105)|2 ∼ 1/N, so that cmn ∼ 1/N 2 for all m, n. For the
PR this implies ξq,n ∼ N 1−q, and thus ξµ ∼ N lg(µ)−|µ|,
with lg(µ) the number of terms in the sequence µ. In the
opposite case where eigenvectors |m(cid:105) and |n(cid:105) coincide,
all ξµ are equal to 1. These distinct features reﬂect in
the behavior of the moments hk
n (for instance, the sum
hn0 was proposed as a
n0
tool to measure the degree of equilibration of an isolated
quantum system [22]).
In these two extreme regimes ∆S has very distinct be-
haviors. In the delocalized case where ξµ ∼ N lg(µ)−|µ|,
we have for instance ξ2 ∼ 1/N, while the two last brack-
ets in Eq. (15) correspond to terms scaling as 1/N 2 and
1/N 3, respectively. One can thus truncate the sum (14)
to any order by keeping terms with the same power in
N. Order 0 is simply given by the constant 1 − γ, which
coincides with the result of [5]. Keeping the term in 1/N
yields our ﬁrst main result Eq. (13), and as already men-
tioned explains the conjecture of [5].

In the localized case, on the other hand, the expansion
(14) is no longer valid, as each term ξµ is of order 1. How-
ever, the truncation (15) happens to yield a very good
approximation for ∆S, as shown on the physical models
in Figs. 1 and 2, where at small λ or large W the nu-
merically computed ∆S is almost indistinguishable from

4

the expression for O3. This can be understood via the
following perturbation-theory approach. Let us consider
the simplest case of a localized model, where H(cid:48) = H+V
and V is a symmetric matrix with elements of order 1.
Standard perturbation theory for  (cid:28) 1 yields

As the constant in front of 2 in (23) is 1/96, at this order
∆S is essentially equal to 133/144− γ (cid:39) 0.346395, as can
be seen in the ﬁgures in the localized region. At the next
order O3 on the other hand, the constant 167/288 − γ (cid:39)
0.00264545 almost vanishes, while 227/384 (cid:39) 0.591146 is
numerically very close to 2(1 − log 2) (cid:39) 0.613706. Thus
the expression (24) almost coincides with (20), which ex-
plains why the truncation at O3 works so well. Trun-
cation at order 4 (which can be obtained from the gen-
eral result given explicitly in the Supplemental material)
, so that
this approximation is worse than order 3 (and the same
happens at higher orders). O3 thus appears as the op-
timal truncation in the localized regime. As was noted

would yield ∆S (cid:39) 1.2184 − 1.68839(cid:80)

above, this truncation also works quite well in the delo-
calized regime. One sees from the numerical results that
Eq. (15) is in fact a good approximation for ∆S over the
whole range of parameters.

To summarize, there is a quest for a quantum entropy
with all the required properties. The DE is a good can-
didate and here we give an analytical expression for its
time average as a function of eigenvector properties only,
to a very good approximation and independently of the
dynamical properties, in particular of the localization-
delocalization or chaotic-integrable characteristics. Our
results establish the validity of the conjecture of Ref. [5]
and extend its accuracy. These results are relevant in

the relation between many-body localization transition
and the study of equilibration in non-equilibrium isolated
quantum systems.

In this Supplemental material we provide a detailed proof of the general relation Eq. (14) of the main text. We

recall that ∆S is deﬁned as

∆S = −(cid:88)

(cid:88)

hn ln hn +

hn ln hn,

with transition probabilities given by

(cid:88)

n

hn =

m1,m2

To make notations lighter we will drop the index n until the very last equation. The demonstration goes as follows.
First we obtain an expression for the moments hk as sums over integer partitions (section 1). Then, through the
inverse Laplace transform, we can get the distribution P (h) to calculate Eq. (4)
(section 2). To achieve this we
ﬁrst have to reexpress the moments in a way where resummation and simpliﬁcation becomes feasible (section 3), and
ﬁnally obtain the full expression for ∆S (section 4).

= 24 − 72ξ2 + 18(ξ2)2 + 64ξ3 − 33ξ4

(see p. 24 of [1]). The pλ are simply related to the PR deﬁned by Eq. (30) by

m

For λ (cid:96) k, the pλ and mλ are related by the linear relation

cm = h.

by λ (cid:96) k a partition λ = (λ1, λ2, . . .) of k, with λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . and(cid:80)

It is possible to obtain these expressions in a systematic way by introducing integer partitions. It is usual to denote
i λi = k (it can be padded on the right by an
arbitrary number of zeros). The products of ξq appearing in the expressions (27)–(29) for hk correspond to all possible
integer partitions of the integer k. For instance, noticing that ξ1 = 1, the terms ξ4, ξ3ξ1, ξ2
1 contributing
to Eq. (29) correspond to the partitions 4 = 3 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. Following standard textbooks
[1], one can deﬁne several families of symmetric polynomials of the variables cm, 1 ≤ m ≤ N. We set

1 and ξ4

2, ξ2ξ2

mλ =

cσ(λ1)

cσ(λ2)

. . . cσ(λN )

N

,

(31)

where the sum runs over all permutations of (λ1, λ2, . . . , λN ) (see p. 18 of [1]); if N is smaller than the number of
nonzero λi’s then by convention mλ = 0. We also deﬁne the polynomials

(cid:88)

σ

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

pλ = (

cλ1
m )(

cλ2
m ) . . .

(p. 103 of [1]), with Lλµ an invertible lower-triangular matrix of integers indexed by partitions λ, µ, of k.

Taking the k th power of Eq. (26) and keeping only terms where the energies exactly compensate, we get the general

expression of the k th moment as

hk =

P (m1, . . . , mk)cm1cm2 . . . cmk

(35)

(cid:88)

m1,...,mk

with P (m1, . . . , mk) the number of permutations of the mi. We then group together all terms with the same ‘pattern’
of indices, e.g., for k = 3, terms with m1 = m2 = m3 or m1 = m2 (cid:54)= m3 or m1 (cid:54)= m2 (cid:54)= m3, which corresponds to the
diﬀerent integer partitions 3=2+1=1+1+1. The expression (35) simply reduces to

hk =

P 2

λ mλ

(36)

with Pλ the multinomial coeﬃcient associated with (λ1, λ2, . . .) and mλ the symmetric polynomial (31). In order to
relate the mean moments to the PR, we want to express hk by means of the pλ rather than the mλ; inverting the
relation (34) we get

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

λ(cid:96)k

µ(cid:96)k

hk =

λ (L

Setting Zµ =(cid:80)

λ(cid:96)k P 2

λ (L−1)λµ we have the ﬁnal compact expression

hk =

(cid:88)

λ(cid:96)k

(cid:88)

µ(cid:96)k

The Lλµ, and thus the Zµ, can be calculated very easily using mathematical software, while pµ is obtained from
Eq. (33). For instance, one gets for k = 3 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 (where partitions are ordered in that reverse
lexicographic order) the matrix L = {{1, 0, 0},{1, 1, 0},{1, 3, 6}}, and multinomial coeﬃcients P3 = 1, P21 = 3 and
P111 = 6, so that Zµ is the vector (4,−9, 6), which allows to recover indeed Eq. (28).

2. From moments to entropy diﬀerence

The knowledge of the moments (38) allows to reconstruct the probability distribution P (h). Indeed, let

(cid:90) ∞

M (t) =

0

dhP (h)eth

be the moment generating function of P (h). Then M (t) can be expressed as a series

∞(cid:88)

k=0

hk
k!

tk.

M (t) =

It is then possible to get P (h) from inverse Laplace transform of M (t), namely

(cid:90) c+i∞

c−i∞

P (h) =

1
2iπ

dtethM (−t)

with c a real number such that the contour in (41) goes to the right of all poles (the M (−t) comes from the fact
that (39) is not exactly a Laplace transform as there is a factor eth rather than e−th). The entropy diﬀerence ∆S
associated with h is then simply given by

(cid:90) ∞

− h ln h + h ln h = −h ln h +

dhP (h)h ln h.

0

In order to perform the sum over k in (40) we ﬁrst have to rewrite the moments hk under a form where the dependence
on k is more transparent.

3. Reexpressing the moments

(cid:18)k

(cid:19)

s

Zµ = k!

˜Zµ(cid:48)

The aim of this section is to show that Zµ appearing in Eq. (38) can be put under the form

where s = (cid:80)
Zµ = (cid:80)

λ(cid:96)k P 2

µi≥2 µi and µ(cid:48) is the partition of s obtained by removing the 1’s from µ, with ˜Zµ(cid:48) rational numbers.
For instance, for all partitions of the form µ = (211 . . . 1) we have µ(cid:48) = (2) and s = 2. From its explicit deﬁnition
λ (L−1)λµ it is easy to calculate Z2 = −1, Z21 = −6, Z211 = −12, Z2111 = −20 and so on, so that
Eq. (43) holds with ˜Z2 = − 1
4. In the special case of partitions
of the form µ = (111 . . . 1), Eq. (43) can still be satisﬁed by setting µ(cid:48) = (0) and ˜Z0 = 1.

2. Similarly we can compute ˜Z3 = 2

3, ˜Z4 = − 11

In order to show Eq. (43), we start by noting that the Lλµ can be interpreted as the number of ways of adding
together the λi in order to obtain the µi (see [1] p. 103). For example, for k = 3 the partition λ = (111) can yield the
partition µ = (21) by adding two 1’s. There are three diﬀerent ways of doing so, hence the entry L111,21 = 3 given in
subsection 1.

Let λ (cid:96) k be a ﬁxed partition of k such that all λi ≥ 2. From their deﬁnition, the quantities Zµ verify

8 , ˜Z22 = 3

It can be rewritten as a double sum over the number r of 1’s in the partition µ and over partitions µ(cid:48) of k − r not
containing any 1. We thus have

(cid:88)

µ(cid:96)k

(46)

(cid:88)
where we have introduced the notation ˜Zµ = Zµ/(k!(cid:0)k

k(cid:88)

µ(cid:48)

that ˜Zµ in fact only depends on µ(cid:48) and not on r.

(48)

If we adjoin a 1 to the partition λ, we get the partition (λ1), which is a partition of k + 1. For this partition,

Since Lν(λ1) can be interpreted as the number of ways of adding together the νi in order to obtain the elements of
(λ1), which are the λi and the additional term 1, necessarily this additional 1 has to come from a 1 appearing among
the νi. In particular this implies that the term r = 0 in the sum (46) must vanish, and that ν is of the form (µ1).
There are r possible ways of choosing this additional 1 (the total number of 1’s in ν), and then the number of ways
to group the remaining νi = µi to get the λi is precisely Lµλ. Thus Lν(λ1) = L(µ1)(λ1) = rLµλ, and ν(cid:48) = µ(cid:48). Shifting
the sum in (46) yields

k(cid:88)

(cid:88)

which after simpliﬁcation reduces to

Comparing Eq. (48) with Eq. (45) one gets that ˜Z(µ1) = ˜Zµ. Proceeding in the same way recursively one can show
that all ˜Z(µ1...1) are equal: we denote them ˜Zµ(cid:48), which proves Eq. (43).

4. Resummation of contributions

9

We are now in a position to calculate the distribution P (h). Using the above result, Eq. (38) can be rewritten

using the deﬁnition (32) of pλ and the notation µ = (µ(cid:48)11 . . . 1), and with s =(cid:80)

hk =

µ(cid:96)k

k!

,

1µ(cid:48)

µ(cid:48) = (µ(cid:48)

2 . . .) with µ(cid:48)

i. Any given sequence of numbers
i ≥ 2 will contribute to each moment hk with k ≥ s through the partition (µ(cid:48)11 . . . 1) of k with

˜Zµ(cid:48)pµ(cid:48)pk−s

(cid:88)

(cid:19)

The inverse Laplace transform (41) then yields the contribution of µ(cid:48) to the probability distribution P (h). There is
a single pole of order s + 1 at −1/h, whose residue is given by

˜Zµ(cid:48)pµ(cid:48)pk−s
