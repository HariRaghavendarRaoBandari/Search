Abstract

We present 15 new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-43b in the i(cid:48),g(cid:48), and R ﬁlters
with the 1.0-m telescopes of Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network and
the IAC80 telescope. We combine our 15 new light curves with 52 others from literature, to
analyze homogeneously all the available transit light curves of this exoplanet. By extending the
time span of the monitoring of the transits to more than 5 yr, and by analyzing the individual
mid-times of 72 transits, we study the proposed shortening of the orbital period of WASP-43b.
We estimate that the times of transit are well-matched by our updated ephemeris equation, using
a constant orbital period. We estimate an orbital period change rate no larger than ˙P = −0.02±
6.6 ms yr−1, which is fully consistent with a constant period. Based on the timing analysis, we
discard stellar tidal dissipation factors Q∗ < 105. In addition, with the modelling of the transits
we update the system parameters: a/Rs = 4.867(23), i = 82.11(10)◦ and Rp/Rs = 0.15942(41),
noticing a diﬀerence in the relative size of the planet between optical and NIR bands.

Introduction

Exoplanets with ultra short orbital periods ((cid:46)
1 d) are rare. Of the current ∼ 2000 conﬁrmed
exoplanets, 17 objects exhibit orbital periods of

less than 1.3 days (based on the exoplanets.org
public compilation: Han et al. 2014). The most
extreme case of these objects is the Earth-size
planet Kepler-178b, with an orbital period of only
8.5 h (Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013). Also, 8/17
of these planets have radii of ≤ 2 REarth, while
the rest spans between 10 and 20 Earth radii
with masses no larger than than 2 MJupiter, with
the exception of WASP-18b which has an esti-
mated mass of 10 MJupiter (Hellier et al. 2009).
One of these objects is WASP-43b (Hellier et al.
2011), a 0.93 RJupiter size planet with a mass of
1.83 MJupiter, orbiting a K star in only 0.81 d
(Gillon et al. 2012). Since its detection and con-

1

ﬁrmation by the Wide-Angle Search for Planets
(WASP) group, this exoplanet has been studied
intensively. For example, Gillon et al. (2012) re-
ported an extended follow-up which included the
observations of 20 transits with the 0.6 m TRAn-
siting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope
(TRAPPIST) in a I + z ﬁlter, 3 transits with the
Euler telescope (Gunn− r(cid:48) band) and 7 secondary
transits in the NIR (5 in the Sloan − z(cid:48) ﬁlter
with TRAPPIST and 2 in narrow-band ﬁlters at
the ESO Very Large Telescope). This work pre-
sented an estimation of the planet temperature,
Teq = 1440 K, and a re-estimation the planet
mass, 2 MJupiter. Shortly after, Wang et al. (2013)
reported two secondary transit observations, de-
riving a Tplanet ∼ 1850 K. Later, Blecic et al.
(2014) also observed secondary transits with the
Spitzer space telescope. Based on the central
times of Gillon et al. (2012) transits and amateur
data from the Exoplanet Transit Database (Pod-
dan´y et al. 2010), Blecic et al. (2014) reported
for the ﬁrst time a hint of change in the orbital
˙P = −0.095 ± 0.036 s yr−1. Due to
period of
the closeness to its host star and the relative high
stellar brightness (V = 12.4 mag), WASP-43b
is a very suitable target for atmospheric studies.
One example of these studies is the transmission
spectrum observations obtained with OSIRIS in-
strument at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias
(GTC) presented by Murgas et al. (2014). In ad-
dition to the tentative detection of N aI in the
atmosphere of WASP-43b, Murgas et al. (2014)
re-estimated the shortening of the orbital period
to ˙P = −0.15 ± 0.06 s yr−1 by including 5 new
epochs in the analysis. Chen et al. (2014) pre-
sented 7 broad-band simultaneous observations
(from g(cid:48) to K ﬁlter) of a primary and a sec-
ondary transit using GROND instrument at the
2.2m MPG/ESO Telescope, reporting a possible
diﬀerence between the transit depths of the op-
tical and NIR light curves. Furthermore, using
a re-analysis of Gillon et al. (2012) and amateur
data, Chen et al. (2014) also calculated a non-
negligible ˙P = −0.09 ± 0.04 s yr−1. Recently, 6
transits and 5 eclipses observations with WFC3
instrument on board of the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST) were presented to constrain the water
abundance in the WASP-43b atmosphere (Kreid-
berg et al. 2014). These data were revisited by
Stevenson et al. (2014) and Kataria et al. (2015)

2

to map the thermal structure of the planet along
the full orbital phase and to ﬁt a circulation model
of the planet, respectively. Along with these stud-
ies on the exoplanet atmosphere, Stevenson et al.
(2014) reported high precision mid-times for each
transit. Additional transits were also reported by
Maciejewski et al. (2013), 1 epoch in R and 1 with-
out ﬁlter, and Ricci et al. (2015), 7 observations
of 6 diﬀerent epochs in the R, V and i(cid:48) ﬁlters, giv-
˙P = −0.03 ± 0.03 s yr−1.
ing a a new value of
During the writing of this work, 9 new transits
observations of WASP-43b were reported by Jiang
et al. (2015). Combining their data to the liter-
ature transits, they found that the amplitude of
orbital decay is consistent with previous works,
˙P = −0.029 ± 0.008 s yr−1 and therefore, a slow
decreasing rate of the period was not discarded.

Here, we present a total of 15 new transit ob-
servations on 9 diﬀerent epochs. Of these, 14 tran-
sits were obtained with Las Cumbres Observatory
Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network while one
transit was observed with the 0.8m IAC80 Tele-
scope. Combining these new data and all the lit-
erature transits available for WASP-43b, we per-
form an homogeneous analysis of the light curves,
with special focus in the transit times, to probe
the proposed orbital decay. Along with the timing
studies, we also revisited the system and transit
parameters of WASP-43b. In Section 2 we present
our observations,
in Section 3 we describe the
modelling of the transits, in Section 4 we present
the timing analysis of the transits divided in two
parts: in Section 4.1 we present the time analysis
of the 58 transits analyzed in this work while in
Section 4.2 we include into the analysis additional
timing information available for this planet.
In
Section 5 we use our timing results to constrain
the tidal dissipation eﬃciency of WASP-43. Fi-
nally in Section 6 we present our conclusions.

2. Observations

We present 15 new observations, obtained in 9
diﬀerent transit epochs, of the exoplanet WASP-
43b. Of these, 6 events were observed simul-
taneously in the i(cid:48) and g(cid:48) ﬁlters with the 1.0-
m LCOGT Network, other two transits were ob-
served only with the g(cid:48) or the i(cid:48) ﬁlter also at the
1.0-m LCOGT, and one additional epoch was ob-
served in the R band with the 0.8-m IAC80 tele-

scope at Teide Observatory, Spain. The node
of the LCOGT Network located at Cerro Tololo
Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile was
used to observed 6 of the epochs. The 1.0-m
telescopes at the CTIO site are equipped with
Sinistro cameras, with a Field-of-View (FoV) of
27 × 27 arcmin2, a pixel size of 0.389 arcsec, and
a readout time of 51 s without binning. Other two
epochs were observed using the telescopes of the
node at the South African Astronomical Observa-
tory (SAAO). This node was equipped with a Sbig
camera with a FoV of 16×16 arcmin2, a pixel scale
of 0.232 arcsec, and a readout time of 15.5 s when
using the 2 × 2 binning mode. Some of the obser-
vations were taken with the telescopes defocused
in order to increase the number of counts per ob-
ject without reaching the non-linearity regime of
the detectors. The egress of the transit in 2014-
May-26 was lost due to bad weather conditions at
CTIO.

The transit at IAC80 telescope was observed
using the CAMELOT instrument. CAMELOT
has a collector area of 2048x2048 pixels2 with
two readout ampliﬁer channels, a FoV of 10.4x10.4
arcmin2 and a pixel scale of 0.304 arcsec. The ob-
servation was performed using the 500 KHz read-
out speed in both channels without binning, hav-
ing thus a readout time of 4.4 s. Our last ob-
servation was executed in 2016-Feb-04 and corre-
sponds to the transit epoch 2329 (using as E=0 the
reference epoch from Hellier et al. (2011)). With
this observation we extend the monitoring of the
WASP-43b transits to 5.2 yr. The observing log
of each observation is shown in Table 1.

2.1. Reduction and Photometry

All images were processed using the pipeline de-
scribed in Brown et al. (2013). Brieﬂy, the entirely
automated procedure includes bad-pixel masking,
bias subtraction, dark subtraction, ﬂat ﬁeld cor-
rection and astrometric solution. We used cus-
tom made Python pipelines to perform diﬀeren-
tial aperture photometry on the target and sev-
eral stars in the FoV are used as reference. We
choose the best reference stars by identifying the
objects which produce the lowest RMS in the out-
of-transit (oot) data. The size of the aperture and
the ring used to measure the sky background were
also chosen with the same RMS criteria. The ﬁnal
aperture radii were on the range of the 13-20 pix-

3

els, and the radii and widths of the sky rings were
between 18-25 and 10-20 pixels, respectively.

2.2. Literature transits

We have included in our homogeneous analy-
sis all the light curves available in the literature.
We used 23 transits from Gillon et al. (2012), 2
transits from Maciejewski et al. (2013), the 7 light
curves from Chen et al. (2014) of the epoch=499
transit, the 5 transits from Murgas et al. (2014)
and the 7 light curves from Ricci et al. (2015) (ob-
tained in 6 diﬀerent epochs). The epoch and ﬁlter
of each transit is shown in Table 2. We also ﬁt the
8 transits recently reported Jiang et al. (2015) in
order to include their epochs in our timing analy-
sis although we did not use it in Section 3 to derive
the ﬁnal system parameters.

3. Modelling

We used the TAP package (Gazak et al. 2012)
for the simultaneous modelling of all the light
curves. This package allows to ﬁt for orbital and
transit parameters using the analytic function of
Mandel & Agol (2002) to describe the exoplane-
tary transits. TAP also incorporates the wavelet
method of Carter & Winn (2009) to estimate the
correlated noise in the light curves and the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to calcu-
late the uncertainties of the ﬁtted parameters. In
particular the parameters subject to be ﬁtted are:
orbital period (P ), inclination (i), eccentrycity (e),
longitude of the periastron (w), relative distance
to the host star (a/Rs), planet-to-star radii ra-
tio (Rp/Rs), transit mid-time (Tc) and the coeﬃ-
cients of a limb-darkening quadratic law (u1 and
u2). Furthermore, this version also allows to ﬁt
for a time dependent linear function (i.e. Fslope
and Fshif t) in addition to the noise parameters
(σred and σwhite) from the wavelet method, as-
suming that the correlated noise can be described
by a 1/f γ function, where f is the frequency and
γ is assumed to be equal to 1 (see Carter & Winn
(2009) for details). Two diﬀerent methodologies
were employed.

3.1. Method 1: Joint modelling with free

Rp/Rs

In order to explore any variation as a function
of wavelength, in a ﬁrst step we grouped the tran-
sits according to the ﬁlter and telescope and ﬁt
for Rp/Rs and (u1,u2) on each set of light curves.
We modelled i and a/Rs simultaneously in all the
transits, ﬁxing P to 0.81347385 d from Murgas
et al. (2014), and e = w = 0. The midtime of each
transit ( Tc) and the rest of the parameters were
left free to vary individually on each transit. We
used 10 MCMC chains of 105 links each. The re-
sulting parameters were obtained from the median
of the posterior distributions and its respective un-
certainties from the 16 and 84 percentile levels. In
Fig. 1 and 2, we show each transit light curve
and its ﬁnal model for the LCOGT and literature
transits, respectively, and in Table 2 we show the
parameters obtained using TAP. In Figure 3 we
show the values of Rp/Rs for each group of light
curves, which present a very good agreement for
the optical ﬁlters. Only the two transits in I and
i(cid:48) of Ricci et al. (2015) deviate from the rest of
the optical band transits, probably due to the low
quality of these light curves. We also notice that
the NIR transits depths (J-,H- and K- bands) also
deviate signiﬁcantly from the optical values. Chen

et al. (2014) reported a similar deviation in the z(cid:48)-
,H- and K- bands, but their diﬀerences were not
statistically signiﬁcant. A multi-epoch study in
NIR bands would be needed to conﬁrm this ﬁnd-
ing.

3.2. Method 2: Joint modelling with com-

mon Rp/Rs

To take advantage of the large amount of data
we have, we use all the light curves in the mod-
elling to reﬁne the ﬁnal planet parameters. We
repeated the method described in Section 3.1 but
this time ﬁtting Rp/Rs simultaneously for all the
optical and the NIR transits from Chen et al.
(2014). Here we remove some transits from the
joint modelling since we have identiﬁed in the pre-
vious step that its respective Rp/Rs values de-
viates considerably from the rest of the transits.
In particular, we removed from the simultaneous
modelling of Rp/Rs the i(cid:48) and I transits from Ricci
et al. (2015), and the E=538, 554 and 624 tran-
sits from Murgas et al. (2014) whose transit depths
were strongly aﬀected by bad weather and/or tech-
nical issues during observation. We have not in-
cluded in this step the data from Jiang et al. (2015)
since these transits were only available at a ﬁnal
stage of this work. As in method 1, the u1 and u2

−0.00145, 0.15948 ± 0.00004, and
(2015): 0.15988+0.00133
0.15929 ± 0.00045, respectively. On the other
hand, the Rp/Rs derived from NIR transits devi-
ates signiﬁcatively from these measurements (see
Figure 3), even though Stevenson et al. (2014)
value is based on data which cover the J- and H-
ﬁlters.

4. Timing Analysis

For the modelling of our light curves we use
the mid-exposure time of each frame recorded in
Julian Days (UTC). Later on, we transform the
resulting Tc for each transit to Barycentric Julian
Days (BJD) in the Barycentric Dynamical Time
(TDB) standard as suggested by Eastman et al.
(2010). For the literature values we also performed
the necessary transformation of the central times
of their original time standard to BJDT DB. As
mentioned before, we have obtained simultaneous
observations of 6 transits epochs with two 1-m
LCOGT telescopes (3 additional transits were not
observed simultaneously). The mid-times we ob-
tained for each of the simultaneous observations
are consistent within the errors, with the excep-
tion of the transits of epoch 1834, which deviates
by 1.5σ (very likely due to an underestimated error
and/or unaccounted systematics in the g(cid:48) transit).
Furthermore, our retrieved mid-times for the lit-
erature data are also consistent with the original
reported values. The average diﬀerence between
those mid-times is only ∼ 0.35σ.

4.1. Timing results from the mid-times of

our homogeneous analysis

To adjust the mid-times of the 67 transits ob-
tained in Section 3, we used a linear ephemeris
equation of the form:

T (E) = T0 + E × P,

(1)

where the central time of the transit Tc at epoch
E, is calculated with respect to the reference time
T0 using the orbital period P . To update the linear
ephemeris we used the scipy.optimize module of
Python and the emcee MCMC sampler implemen-
tation (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We ﬁt for P
and T0, and estimate its uncertainties using 1000
walkers with 5000 links each. In a ﬁrst step, we
identiﬁed that the two transits of epoch 1469 de-
viate by more than 147 s. As these transits were

Fig. 3.— Here we show the values of Rp/Rs ob-
tained for each set of light curves modelled inde-
pendently. We label each set using the ﬁlter and
author as follow: (a) Murgas et al. (2014), (b)
Maciejewski et al. (2013), (c) Chen et al. (2014),
(d) Ricci et al. (2015), (e) Gillon et al. (2012), (f)
Jiang et al. (2015) and (LCOGT) and (IAC80) are
from this work. The top black solid line and the
grey region correspond to the resulting value, and
its errors, of the joint modelling of all the light
curves (Section 3.2). We unlinked from the joint
modelling the i(cid:48) and I from (d), which deviate
noticeably from the rest of the sets (see text for
details). The lower ﬂat line shows the result from
the joint modelling of the NIR transits: J, H and
K from (c).

coeﬃcients are ﬁtted by groups.
By doing this we obtained Rp/Rs = 0.15942 ±
0.00041 and Rp/Rs = 0.1498± 0.0021 for the opti-
cal and NIR bands, respectively. Additionally, we
obtained i = 82.11± 0.10, and a/Rs = 4.867+0.023
−0.025
from all the light curves. As expected, the val-
ues of a/Rs and i do not diﬀer from those ob-
tained before, but the optical Rp/Rs is one or-
der of magnitude more precise by using the joint
modelling. Regarding the mid-times of each tran-
sit we obtained values fully consistent between the
two methods. Our derived Rp/Rs is also consis-
tent with the values reported by Murgas et al.
(2014), Stevenson et al. (2014) and Jiang et al.

(in parenthesis) were adopted from the 50%, 16%
and 84% percentiles of the drawn posterior dis-
tributions, respectively. The RMS of the timing
residuals is 37 s. The χ2 of this ﬁt is 121, the
reduced-χ2 is 1.93 and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC = 2log(ν) + χ2, where ν is the
number of degrees of freedom) is 130.

To probe for orbital decay, i.e. a shortening of
the orbital period with time, we also explore the
possibility that the transit times can be adjusted
by including a quadratic additional term. There-
fore we ﬁt the transit times using, as in Adams
et al. (2010), the following ephemeris equation:

Tc(E) = T0 + E × P +

1
2

δP × E(E − 1),

(3)

where the new term δP corresponds to the
change rate of the orbital period per epoch−2
(δP = ˙P ×P ). Using the same procedure as in the
linear case, the resulting values of this quadratic
ﬁt are: δP = (0.38 ± 1.90) × 10−10 d epoch−2,
P = 0.81347404(19) d and T0(BJDT DB) =
2455528.868610(66). This new δP , which can be
translated to ˙P = 1.5 ± 7.3 ms yr−1,
is fully
consistent with a constant orbital period.

This quadratic ﬁt has a RM S of 37 s, a χ2 of
121, a reduced-χ2 of 1.96 and a BICquad = 134.
These numbers suggest that the linear equation is
the most likely function to describe the transits of
WASP-43b.

4.2.

Including additional transit mid-times

Although we could not include in our modelling
the transit light curves presented in Hellier et al.
(2011) and Stevenson et al. (2014), we check our
results by using their published mid-times. Since
we do not have any common transit as a com-
parison point we use their reported uncertainties
without scaling them. Thus, we repeat the ﬁt-
ting process using a total of 72 transits, resulting

in the most comprehensive study of the WASP-
43b transits to date. We obtain in this case a
˙P = −0.02 ± 6.6 ms yr−1, consistent again with
the constant orbital period case. Furthermore, in
this case the BIC also favors the linear equation
(BIClin = 353) over a non-constant period sce-
nario (BICquad = 358). Therefore, this new value
˙P rules out deﬁnitively a rapid or slowly pe-
of
riod decay of the WASP-43b exoplanet. Is worth
mentioning that our monitoring includes a transit
in the epoch=2329, which extends the monitor-
ing 381 d beyond the last epoch reported by Jiang
et al. (2015), totaling more than 5 years of follow-
up. Long term monitoring is critical to probe
small amplitude timing variations in the transits
of exoplanets (e.g. see Fig.14 of Birkby et al. 2014;
Hoyer et al. 2016).

Finally, using the 72 transits we calculate the

updated linear ephemeris function:
T (E) = 2455528.868634(46) + E × 0.813473978(35),
(4)
where the RM S of the timing residuals is 35 s,
the reduced-χ2 = 4.9 and the BIC = 353.

The Observed minus Calculated diagram of the
transit mid-times based on this linear ﬁt is shown
in Figure 4, where the open points represent the
literature transits analyzed in Section 3, the gray
points are from Hellier et al. (2011) and Steven-
son et al. (2014), and the red points correspond
to the new transits presented in this work. The
red region corresponds to the 1σ uncertainties of
the linear ﬁt. In this Figure the ﬁtted quadratic
function based on the 72 transits and its 1σ errors
are represented by the solid black line and the blue
light region, respectively. For comparison we plot
with the dashed line the decay function obtained
by Jiang et al. (2015). It is clear that despite the
errors in the mid-times and the dispersion of the
residuals, the most recent epochs do not follow the
proposed ˙P = −28 ms yr−1.

5. Constraints on Q*

Stellar tidal dissipation, usually characterized
through the quality or eﬃciency factor, Q∗, can
drives the planet orbital motion and determine,
for example, the life time before it collides with its
host star (Levrard et al. 2009; Penev et al. 2012).
Therefore, empirical constraints of Q∗ are relevant
for models of formation and evolution of close-in

Fig. 4.— Observed minus Calculated diagram of 72 transit mid-times of WASP-43b. The timing residuals
obtained from the 65 light curves analyzed in this work are shown. The white and red points correspond to
the literature and the new transits presented in this work, respectively, while the gray points represent the
mid-times reported by Hellier et al. (2011) and Stevenson et al. (2014). The timing residuals are based on
our updated linear ephemeris equation (Eq. 4), and the red region represents its ±1σ errors. The solid black
line and the light blue region represent the ﬁtted quadratic function and its uncertainties, respectively. The
dashed line corresponds to the changing period function reported by Jiang et al. (2015).

exoplanets. Measuring the shortening of orbital
periods of transiting exoplanets is a direct way to
estimate Q∗ (e.g. Matsumura et al. 2010; Penev
et al. 2012; Birkby et al. 2014; Hoyer et al. 2016).
For WASP-43, previous studies pointed to Q∗ be-
tween 104 − 1010 (Hellier et al. 2009; Blecic et al.
2014; Jiang et al. 2015). In particular, using the
equations in Birkby et al. (2014), we calculate that
the previous reported ˙P = −30 ms yr−1 implies
a Q∗ ≈ 4 × 104 and therefore a Tshif t ≈ 170 s in
the time arrival of the transits after 5 years. Such
large time deviation is not detected in our O − C
diagram (Figure 4). Now, based on the uncertain-
˙P (±6.6 ms yr−1), we
ties of our estimation of
derive a Q∗ ≈ 2 × 105 and a Tshif t ≈ 39 s after
5 yr which is is consistent with our transit timing,
considering the RM S = 35 s of the time residuals
we obtained. Larger values of Q∗ result, after 5 yr,
in time deviations of smaller amplitude than the
dispersion of the O − C. Thus, for WASP-43 we
can discard Q∗ values smaller than 105. With this
precision in ˙P , and if the dispersion of residuals of

the transit times continues in the 30 s level after
5 additional years (i.e. around the epoch 4500), it
would be possible to probe the Q∗ < 106 limit.

6. Conclusions

With the timing analysis of 72 transit of WASP-
43b, we have estimated that the change rate of
the orbital period is consistent with zero. By ex-
tending the time span of the monitoring to more
than 5 yr, i.e. to 2329 orbits, we have constrained
the orbital decay to ˙P = −0.02 ± 6.6 ms yr−1,
which is 3 order smaller than values previously re-
˙P , we can
ported. Based on our estimation of
discard Q∗ < 105 for WASP-43. Finally, by ﬁtting
together the optical transit light curves we have
a re-estimation of the relative size of the planet,
Rp/Rs = 0.15942 ± 0.00041, a value also consis-
tent with previous studies. We also found a diﬀer-
ence between the Rp/Rs derived from optical and
NIR ﬁlters. We note that the HST data of Steven-
son et al. (2014) cover the 1.1− 1.7µm wavelength

and their reported Rp/Rs is fully consistent with
our optical results. Thus, additional NIR observa-
tions are needed to state deﬁnitively this discrep-
ancy.
