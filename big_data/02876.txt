BLACKBODY RADIATION FROM ISOLATED NEPTUNES

Sivan Ginzburg1, Re’em Sari1,2,3, Abraham Loeb3

Draft version March 10, 2016

ABSTRACT

Recent analyses of the orbits of some Kuiper Belt objects hypothesize the presence of an undiscovered
Neptune-size planet at a very large separation from the Sun. The energy budget of Neptunes on such
distant orbits is dominated by the internal heat released by their cooling rather than solar irradiation
(making them eﬀectively “isolated”). The blackbody radiation that these planets emit as they cool
may provide the means for their detection. Here we use an analytical toy model to study the cooling
and radiation of isolated Neptunes. This model can translate a detection (or a null detection) to a
constraint on the size and composition of the hypothesized “Planet Nine”. Speciﬁcally, the thick gas
atmosphere of Neptune-like planets serves as an insulating blanket which slows down their cooling.
Therefore, a measurement of the blackbody temperature, Teﬀ ∼ 50 K, at which a Neptune emits can
be used to estimate the mass of its atmosphere, Matm. Explicitly, we ﬁnd the relation Teﬀ ∝ M 1/12
atm .
Despite this weak relation, a measurement of the ﬂux at the Wien tail can constrain the atmospheric
mass, at least to within a factor of a few, and provide useful limits to possible formation scenarios of
these planets. Finally, we constrain the size and composition of Planet Nine by combining our model
with the null results of recent all-sky surveys.

INTRODUCTION

The presence of an outer undetected planet in the solar
system has been recently suggested, due to possible evi-
dence of its gravitational inﬂuence on the orbits of Kuiper
Belt objects (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos
2014; Trujillo & Sheppard 2014; Batygin & Brown 2016).
Here we focus on the scenario of a ∼ 10M⊕ planet on a
∼ 700 AU semimajor axis orbit (as we show below, the
distance from the Sun is not important for the planet’s
evolution, as long as it is large enough), as proposed by
Batygin & Brown (2016) (see also Malhotra et al. 2016).
As such a planet cools, the internal ﬂux it releases over-
whelms the incident solar irradiation, and its thermal
evolution is independent of the Sun, as if it were iso-
lated. In particular, it has been argued that the internal
luminosity released by the planet may allow its detection
(Cowan et al. 2016; Linder & Mordasini 2016).

In this paper, we study the cooling of isolated planets
assuming a Neptune-like composition. Speciﬁcally, we
relate the observable surface temperature and luminos-
ity to the mass and composition of the planet. Special
attention is given to the gas atmosphere of the planet,
which governs its cooling rate.

Unlike Linder & Mordasini (2016), we do not assume
any speciﬁc formation scenario, and we do not couple the
atmosphere mass fraction to the planet’s mass. Rather,
we analytically derive scaling laws connecting the lumi-
nosity to the mass of the planet and to the mass of the
gas envelope.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we
present our two layer model for Neptune-like planets and

in Section 3 we calculate its evolution over time. Section
4 relates the observable radiation to the planet’s size and
composition, and derives associated constraints from re-
cent all-sky surveys. Our conclusions are summarized in
Section 5.

2. TWO LAYER NEPTUNE MODEL

Below we present a simpliﬁed model for Neptune-like
planets, which contains the essential ingredients needed
to describe their thermal evolution.

We model the planet as having a rocky and icy core,
which amounts to most of the planet’s mass M and ra-
dius R. The core is surrounded by an atmosphere with a
mass Matm < M and a thickness ∆R < R. The assump-
tion of an envelope mass fraction which is smaller than
unity f ≡ Matm/M (cid:46) 0.5 is natural in the context of the
core-nucleated accretion theory of giant planet formation
(Perri & Cameron 1974; Harris 1978; Mizuno et al. 1978;
Mizuno 1980; Stevenson 1982). According to this theory,
once a rocky core accretes roughly its own mass in gas
from the protoplanetary gas-rich disk, a runaway accre-
tion initiates and the planet quickly evolves into a gas
giant with mass M (cid:29) 10M⊕ (Bodenheimer & Pollack
1986; Pollack et al. 1996; Piso & Youdin 2014; Piso et al.
2015).

We approximate the core as an incompressible ﬂuid
with a constant density. As we show below, the overly-
ing atmosphere dictates a high temperature at the core-
envelope boundary, inhibiting the formation of a solid
crust, and keeping the entire core molten. We there-
fore model the core as convective (i.e. having uniform
entropy), and since it is approximated as incompress-
ible, it is also isothermal. These simpliﬁcations are in
accordance with more sophisticated numerical models of
Uranus and Neptune, in which the density and temper-
ature of the core vary only by a factor of a few, while
the pressure changes by orders of magnitude (Hubbard
& Macfarlane 1980; Guillot & Gautier 2014).

2.1. Gas Atmosphere

We model the atmosphere as an ideal hydrogen and he-
lium gas with a polytropic equation of state P ∝ ργ, with
P and ρ denoting the pressure and density respectively
and γ is the polytropic index. Hydrostatic equilibrium
leads to the following temperature proﬁle as a function
of depth x inside the atmosphere
γ − 1
γ

kBT (x) =

µggx,

(1)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, µg is the mean
molecular mass of the gas and g = GM/R2 is the surface
gravity (with G being Newton’s constant). The equilib-
rium temperature that the solar irradiation dictates at
the outer boundary (in the absence of an internal heat
source), Teq ≈ 10 K, is negligible, as we show below.
Equation (1) relates the temperature at the base of the
atmosphere, which is also the temperature of the adja-
cent core, to the thickness of the atmosphere

where we scale to Neptune’s mass, MN, by taking into
account the slight gravitational compression of the core
and using the relation R ∝ M 1/4 instead of a constant
density relation R ∝ M 1/3 (e.g., Valencia et al. 2006;
Baraﬀe et al. 2014).
For present-day Neptune, Equation (2) predicts Tc ≈
3400 K for ∆R/R ≈ 0.2, similar to numerically calcu-
lated structures (Hubbard & Macfarlane 1980), and en-
suring that the core is molten. We note that the deep
interior of a rocky (or iron) core might solidify due to
the high pressures, but we still model it as isothermal
(see also Hubbard & Macfarlane 1980). Icy cores, on the
other hand, do not solidify at these temperatures (Red-
mer et al. 2011).

3. COOLING AND EVOLUTION

In a radiative envelope, the diﬀusion approximation
sets a temperature proﬁle, T ∝ τ 1/4, as a function of the
optical depth τ (see the Appendix, which also discusses
convective proﬁles). The eﬀective surface temperature
Teﬀ which sets the luminosity is determined at τ ∼ 1
and is given by

with τatm ≡ (cid:82) κρdx estimated by assuming a constant

opacity κ ∼ 0.1 cm2 g−1, which is a reasonable approxi-
mation for the low eﬀective temperatures we ﬁnd below
(Alexander et al. 1989; Bell & Lin 1994). A variable
opacity is discussed in the Appendix. RN is the radius of
Neptune. Combining the results of Section 2.1 (speciﬁ-
cally, Tc ≈ 3400 K) with Equation (3) implies an eﬀective
temperature of Teﬀ ≈ 60 K for present-day Neptune, as-
suming a mass fraction f ∼ 10% (see, e.g., Hubbard &
Macfarlane 1980; Guillot 1999), consistent with obser-
vations (Hildebrand et al. 1985) and numerical models
(Fortney & Nettelmann 2010).

Neptune’s eﬀective temperature is higher than its equi-
librium temperature Teq = 47 K by a factor of 1.27, im-
plying that its internal ﬂux exceeds the incident solar
irradiation by a factor of 1.6 (Pearl & Conrath 1991).
While Neptune is only marginally isolated (the internal
heat is comparable to the solar irradiation), we focus here
on lower equilibrium temperatures Teq ≈ 10 K, for which
the planet can be treated as isolated.

We now proceed and formulate a time-dependent cool-
ing model. Such a model is made simple by noting that
the ratio between the internal and eﬀective temperatures
Tc/Teﬀ remains roughly constant during the planet’s evo-
lution, as seen from Equation (3), following that the
mass of the atmosphere Matm is conserved, the radius
is approximately constant because we assume ∆R < R
(this approximation improves as the atmosphere cools
and shrinks with time; see Section 2.1 and Linder & Mor-
dasini 2016) and we approximate the opacity as constant.

10M⊕ = 0.58MN planet with 14% atmosphere by mass. The nu-
merical results (dashed black line) are taken from Linder & Mor-
dasini (2016) while the analytical model (solid blue line) is accord-
ing to Equation (5) and using R ∝ M 1/4.

In Figure 1 we compare the cooling of our toy model
to numerical calculations by Linder & Mordasini (2016).
While our simple model is not exact (speciﬁcally, Teﬀ ∝
t−0.27 ﬁts the numerical calculations better than our
Teﬀ ∝ t−1/3), the deviations are modest enough so that
the model can provide approximate scaling laws relating
the observed temperature and luminosity of an isolated
Planet Nine to its mass and composition.

4. RELATING OBSERVABLES TO COMPOSITION

In this section we discuss the relation between the ob-
servable blackbody radiation from “Planet Nine” to its
size and composition.

Linder & Mordasini (2016) couple the mass fraction of
the atmosphere to the mass of the planet, using planet
formation simulations (Mordasini et al. 2014), relating
larger values of f to more massive planets, thus leaving
only one parameter. Here we prefer not to make any
prior assumptions on the formation scenario, so we treat
the size and the atmosphere mass of the planet as two
independent parameters.

If we assume a speciﬁc composition, especially of the
core (which dominates both the mass and radius), then
the observed blackbody radius R can be translated into
the planet’s mass M . Since the cooling of the planet is
mediated by its gaseous atmosphere, as explained in Sec-
tion 3, the observed temperature can be used to estimate
the mass of the atmosphere, as explicitly demonstrated
by Equation (5).

In Figures 2 and 3 we demonstrate the relation between
the planet’s eﬀective temperature, its size and its atmo-
sphere’s mass. Due to the weak dependence implicit in
Figure 2 and Equation (5), an accurate measurement of
the temperature is required for a tight constraint on the
atmosphere mass. Such accuracy is possible at the Wien
tail of the spectrum, where the dependence of the Planck
function on the temperature is exponential.

Similarly, using Equations (3) and (5) we estimate the
temperature at the atmosphere-core boundary at the age
of the solar system

Tc ≈ 2700 K

.

If this temperature is below the melting point of ice,
then an insulating solid crust forms and the cooling is no

et al. (2011), with the pressure at the boundary deter-

Fig. 2.— The eﬀective temperature of 4.5 Gyr old planets as
a function of their atmosphere’s mass Matm. The curves follow
Equation (5) for three values of the planet’s radius R in units of
Neptune’s radius: 3/4 (bottom black line), 1 (middle blue line),
and 4/3 (top red line). These radii roughly correspond to planet
masses of 5.4M⊕, 17M⊕ = 1MN, and 54M⊕, respectively, assum-
ing Neptune’s composition and accounting for the gravitational
compression of the core. For each planet size, we display atmo-
sphere masses ranging roughly from 1% to 50% of the planet’s
mass.

from Equation (5) and of the temperature at the atmosphere-core

mass. A solid crust forms below the bottom dashed black line, and
the cooling is no longer dominated by the atmosphere. An upper
mass fraction limit of f ≡ Matm/M ≈ 0.5 (dotted red line) is also
provided, assuming Neptune’s composition and accounting for the
gravitational compression of the core.

et al. (2011), we conclude that a solid crust forms only
when the melting curve of ice ﬂattens, close to 300 K,
reached by atmospheres lighter than ≈ 10−3M⊕, as seen
in Equation (6) and Figure 3.

of 22 µm (solid blue lines) and 350 µm (dashed black lines) of 4.5
Gyr old planets at a distance of 700 AU, as a function of their
radius and atmosphere mass. The 22 µm sensitivity of WISE is 6
mJy (Wright et al. 2010), corresponding to the middle solid blue
line, while the 350 µm sensitivity of Planck is 660 mJy (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2014, 2015), corresponding to the top dashed
black line.

The peak emission of a blackbody at Teﬀ ≈ 50 K is
at a wavelength of λ ≈ 60 µm. In Figure 4 we present
the observable ﬂux density at similar wavelengths using
the temperatures calculated by Equation (5) and Fig-
ure 3, assuming a distance of 700 AU. We also compare
these ﬂux densities to the sensitivities of WISE (Wright
et al. 2010) and Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014,
2015). As seen in Figure 4, a null detection by WISE can
(marginally) constrain the size and atmosphere mass of
Planet Nine (below the middle solid blue line), while a
null detection by Planck is less informative.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Recent studies suggest the existence of an undiscov-
ered Neptune-size planet in the outer solar system. The
formation of one or several such planets is not unnatu-
ral within the context of standard formation theories of
the solar system (Bromley & Kenyon 2014; Kenyon &
Bromley 2015). The cooling radiation of Neptunes on
such distant orbits surpasses the ﬂux they receive (and
re-emit) from the Sun.

In this work we modeled these planets using a simple
analytical two-layer model that consists of a rocky/icy
core and a hydrogen/helium envelope. We examined the
evolution of the planets over time and derived scaling
laws relating their eﬀective temperature to their size and
composition, enabling an interpretation of a future de-
tection (or null detection).

Speciﬁcally, we demonstrated that the eﬀective tem-

perature at a given age, Teﬀ , depends on the mass of the
atmosphere, Matm, since it mediates the planet’s cooling.
Explicitly, we found the relation Teﬀ ∝ M 1/12
atm . Despite
this weak relation, an accurate measurement of the eﬀec-
tive temperature is possible in the Wien tail of the spec-
trum, and it can constrain the mass of the atmosphere
at least to within a factor of a few. Even such a rough
estimate can be useful in distinguishing between gas rich
and mainly rocky/icy planets, providing a clue to their
formation scenario. From Figure 3 we ﬁnd that planets
with atmospheres lighter than ∼ 10−3M⊕ develop a solid
insulating crust with a diﬀerent simple two-layer model,
of a convective core and a conducting crust, being ade-
quate in this case (see, e.g., Stevenson et al. 1983).

The approximate analytical

scaling relations we
present here should be supplemented by more elaborate
numerical models to constrain the mass and composi-
tion of such planets,
if discovered. Nonetheless, this
study provides an intuitive demonstration of what we
are able to learn from future observations. In addition,
we demonstrate that a null detection by recent all-sky
surveys can constrain the size and composition of Planet
Nine.

APPENDIX

CONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERE

In Section 3 we assumed that the atmosphere is ra-
diative and has a constant opacity. Here we treat the
atmosphere more generally, allowing for a variable opac-
ity and convection.

ature proﬁle scales with optical depth τ = (cid:82) κρdx as

Using Equation (1) we ﬁnd that an adiabatic temper-
T ∝ τ (γ−1)/γ if the opacity is constant. Convective in-
stability sets in if the radiative proﬁle T ∝ τ 1/4 is steeper
than the adiabatic one, i.e. γ < 4/3. Therefore, molec-
ular hydrogen (γ = 7/5) is indeed stable against con-
vection and if the opacity is constant, the atmosphere is
radiative.
a power law κ ∝ ρaT b, an adiabatic proﬁle scales as

In the case of a variable opacity, which we model with

T ∝ τ (γ−1)/(γ+a+bγ−b).

(A1)

For the diatomic γ = 7/5 Equation (A1) shows that even
a relatively modest increase of the opacity with depth
(temperature or density) leads to convection. For ex-
ample, if b = 0 then a > 0.2 is convectively unstable,
while if a = 0 then b > 0.5 suﬃces. In this case, the at-
mosphere’s proﬁle will be adiabatic, given by Equation
(A1), and ﬂatter in comparison with a radiative one.
We conclude that the temperature ratio given by Equa-
tion (3), Tc/Teﬀ ∝ τ 1/4
atm, provides an upper boundary to
the steepness of the temperature proﬁle and consequently
our scaling of Teﬀ ∝ M 1/12
atm is also an upper bound to the
dependence on Matm. In the relevant regime, the opac-
ity is almost constant (Alexander et al. 1989; Bell & Lin
1994) so even if the proﬁle is convective, it is not very dif-
ferent from the radiative, T ∝ τ 1/4, chosen for simplicity
above.
