Abstract. We explore the possibility that soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous
X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are powered by highly magnetized white dwarfs (B-WDs). We take a
sample of SGRs and AXPs and provide the possible parameter space in mass, radius, and
surface magnetic ﬁeld based on their observed properties (period and its derivative) and the
assumption that these sources obey the mass-radius relation derived for the B-WDs. The
radius and magnetic ﬁeld of B-WDs are adequate to explain energies in SGRs/AXPs as
the rotationally powered energy. In addition, B-WDs also adequately explain the perplexing
radio transient GCRT J1745-3009 as a white dwarf pulsar. Note that the radius and magnetic
ﬁelds of B-WDs are neither extreme (unlike of highly magnetized neutron stars) nor ordinary
(unlike of magnetized white dwarfs, yet following the Chandrasekhar’s mass-radius relation
(C-WDs)).
In order to explain SGRs/AXPs, while the highly magnetized neutron stars
require an extra, observationally not well established yet, source of energy, the C-WDs predict
large ultra-violet luminosity which is observationally constrained from a strict upper limit.
Finally, we provide a set of basic diﬀerences between the magnetar and B-WD hypotheses
for SGRs/AXPs.

Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are astronomical
objects which exhibit pulsations and their properties are diﬀerent from the rotation powered
radio pulsars and accretion powered X-ray pulsars. SGRs/AXPs are, as of now, most pop-
ularly hypothesized to be isolated, spinning down, highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs)
(magnetar model) [1]. According to this model, emission is powered by the energy stored in
strong magnetic ﬁelds of NSs with the surface ﬁeld Bs ∼ 1014 − 1015G. Such strong magnetic
ﬁelds, however, have not been detected from observed data yet and alternate models like fast
rotating white dwarfs (WDs) have been proposed [2].

AXPs are distinguished from X-ray binaries by their narrow period distribution, soft X-
ray spectrum, faint optical counterparts, and long term spin-down. SGRs, on the other hand,
are observed with their bright and short bursts and hence they are considered as a subclass
of gamma-ray bursts. Based on their persistent X-ray counterparts, SGRs were found to
be very similar to AXPs and hence they are often classiﬁed together, as is in the present
work. The rotational period of the AXPs/SGRs, as of now, lies in a narrow range (2 − 12 s)
compared to that for the ordinary pulsars. Moreover, their generally large spin-down rates,
strong outburst energies and giant ﬂares make them diﬀerent from ordinary pulsars.

Typical rotationally powered energy in AXPs/SGRs is ∼ 1032 − 1034 ergs s−1 while
their X-ray luminosity & 1034 ergs s−1, which rules them out to be considered as rotationally
powered NSs. A NS of radius 10km with Bs ∼ 1014 G and central ﬁeld Bc ∼ 1016 G can
have magnetic energy ∼ 1048 ergs s−1, which could produce the luminosity ∼ 1036 ergs
s−1, in its typical age (if they are associated with supernova remnants or young clusters of
massive stars). Such a high ﬁeld, based on the propagation time of magnetic instability in
the NS surface with Alfv´en speed, explains the short duration of initial spike in giant ﬂares.

Furthermore, the strong ﬁeld explains the conﬁnement of the hot plasma required for the
subsequent tail with a softer spectrum pulsating at the NS rotation period. Other phenomena
being explained due to the existence of large magnetic ﬁeld include short bursts in almost all
AXPs/SGRs with peak luminosity exceeding by a few orders of magnitude the Eddington
limit for a NS and high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).

While the above description generally makes the foundation of magnetar model concrete,
there are certain shortcomings in it. First of all, as of now, there is no evidence for the strongly
magnetized NS — as strong as required for the magnetar model. The inferred/measured
strongest possible ﬁeld, in some occasions, has been only ∼ 1012 G [3–5]. Second, recent Fermi
observations are inconsistent with the predicted high energy gamma-ray emissions in the
magnetars [6]. Third, inferred upper limit of Bs for some magnetars, e.g. SGR 0418+5729,
is quite smaller than the ﬁeld required to explain observed X-ray luminosity. Fourth, it has
been shown (e.g. [7–9]) that the attempt to relate magnetars to the energies of the supernova
remnants or the formation of black holes is not viable. Among other inconsistencies, there are
radio pulsars discovered recently with inferred Bs overlapping with those of AXPs/SGRs, but
without any signature of magnetically powered emissions like bursts/ﬂares. On the contrary,
recently discovered NSs with relatively low inferred dipole ﬁeld exhibit outburst properties
similar to those in AXPs/SGRs. These observations imply that a high magnetic dipole
moment is not a mandatory condition for a magnetar.

In order to remove these shortcomings, at least a part, AXPs/SGRs have been argued
to be magnetized WDs [2], following the idea originally proposed more than two decades
back [10] (see also [11]). Due to their larger radius (∼ 104 km for a typical WD), the
rotationally powered energy for WDs could be quite larger than that for NSs. Hence, these
authors attempted to explain the energy released in AXPs/SGRs through the occurrence
of glitch and subsequent loss of the rotational energy.
Indeed, the possibility of glitch in
WDs, as starquakes, with mass around the Chandrasekhar limit [12] was shown earlier [13]
which explained the mean spin-down rate observed for 1E 2259+586. However, this WD
based model (hereinafter C-WD) is challenged by the observed short spin periods (e.g. [3]).
In addition, due to larger radius, they should exhibit larger ultra-violet (UV) luminosities,
which, however, suﬀer from a deep upper limits on the optical counterparts (e.g. [3, 14]) of
some AXPs/SGRs, e.g. SGR 0418+5729 (see, however, [15]).

Recently, Mukhopadhyay and his collaborators, in a series of papers, have proposed for
the existence of highly (as well as very highly) magnetized WDs [16–21] with mass signiﬁ-
cantly super-Chandrasekhar. Bs of such WDs (hereinafter B-WDs) could be as high as 1012
G and Bc could be 2 − 3 orders of magnitude higher (see [22]).

Any new idea, when proposed, generally is tested with a simplistic model ﬁrst. Once, the
results based on a simplistic model show promise to explain observations and/or experiments,
then more realistic self-consistent models, introducing more sophisticated physics, are intro-
duced in order to ﬁne-tune the original model. Without being an exception, Mukhopadhyay
and collaborators have also followed the same tactics to develop their super-Chandrasekhar
WD model (see [23], which discusses the evolution of this topic so far).

These authors have, so far, approached towards this mission through the following steps.
First, they have considered most simplistic, spherically symmetric, very highly magnetized
WDs in the Newtonian framework, assuming the magnetic ﬁeld to be constant or almost
constant throughout (or modeling, as if, the inner region of white dwarfs) [17]. To assure
stability of such WDs, the authors assumed that the large magnetic ﬁeld in them is tan-
gled/ﬂuctuating in a length scale larger than the quantum length scale such that the average

– 2 –

ﬁeld and hence corresponding magnetic pressure is much smaller than the matter pressure
modiﬁed by the Landau eﬀects [19, 24].

However, it has been speculated in those work itself that with very high ﬁelds the self-
consistent consideration of deformation of WDs would reveal a similar super-Chandrasekhar
mass at lower ﬁelds. In the same model framework, they have also shown that magnetized
WDs altogether have a new mass-limit, 80% larger than the Chandrasekhar-limit [19], in the
same spirit as the Chandrasekhar-limit was obtained [12].

Afterwards, the authors have removed both the assumptions: the Newtonian description
[25, 26]). Note that magnetized WDs could be signiﬁcantly
and spherical symmetry (e.g.
smaller in size compared to their conventional counter-parts [17, 19] and, hence, general
relativistic eﬀects therein may not be negligible. Thus, based on a full scale general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) description [27], they have explored more self-consistent
WDs which are ellipsoid and have revealed similar stable masses, as obtained in the simpler
framework, but at smaller ﬁelds [26, 28], as speculated earlier [17, 24]. In fact, in the later
work [26, 28], the authors are able to show that depending on the ﬁeld proﬁles (which were
chosen self-consistent in accordance with other conditions/equations) and hence magnetic
pressure gradient and magnetic density, maximum mass of a B-WD could be even slightly
higher than that proposed earlier [19], but at high ﬁelds (not very high ﬁelds).

Such WDs are already shown to help in explaining peculiar, over-luminous type Ia su-
pernovae whose progenitor masses are necessarily super-Chandrasekhar. Nevertheless, these
B-WDs are smaller or signiﬁcantly smaller in size, depending on the ﬁeld geometry, compared
to their ordinary counterparts (e.g. polar with Bs ∼ 109 G). Typically their radius can just
be an order or two magnitude(s) higher than that of a NS. As the surface temperatures of
WDs with the change of magnetic ﬁelds are not expected to be signiﬁcantly higher [29] (in
fact could be lower [30]), smaller the radius smaller the luminosity of the WD is. Therefore,
B-WDs should be consistent with the UV-luminosity (LU V ) cut-oﬀ in AXPs/SGRs. More-
over, their typical Bs is consistent with observation, but adequate to explain AXP/SGR
energies as rotationally/spin-down powered energy, unlike magnetars.

Furthermore, B-WDs could be adequate candidates to explain certain peculiar radio
pulsars/transients as white dwarf pulsars (WDPs), e.g. GCRT J1745-3009, which is otherwise
thought to be the prototype of a hitherto unknown class of transient radio sources.

Hence, in the present paper, we explore AXPs/SGRs as B-WDs. Note that the idea to
explore B-WDs as AXPs/SGRs has already been presented by independent groups [31, 32].
Although the evolution of B-WDs could be by accretion, they may appear as AXPs/SGRs
at the exhaustion of mass supply after signiﬁcant evolution. Such WDs’ Bs and R combi-
nation can easily explain AXPs/SGRs as rotationally powered WDs. All the machineries
implemented in the magnetar model can be applicable for B-WDs as well, however, with a
smaller Bs which is physically more viable. As the ranges of radii and magnetic ﬁelds of
B-WDs lie in between those of highly magnetized NSs and C-WDs — neither very extreme
nor ordinary, we propose these ranges to be explored extensively in understanding related
observations (not restricted to AXPs/SGRs and WDPs only), in particular the ones which
remain unresolved yet. Therefore, the present work aims at initiating this venture.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we outline the model to explain
magnetized WDs as rotating dipoles. Subsequently, in §§3 and 4, we explore a few sources
of SGR/AXP and GCRT J1745-3009 as B-WDs respectively.
In §5, we present the basic
diﬀerences between the magnetar and B-WD models. Finally, we end in §6 with summary
and implications.

2 Modelling magnetized white dwarfs as rotating dipoles

Following standard electrodynamics [33], the rate of energy loss from a rotating, magnetized
compact star, assuming it to be a rotating dipole, is [34]

˙Erot = −

µ0Ω4 sin4 α

5πc3

|m|2,

(2.1)

when the variation of dipole moment m arises due to the inclination of magnetic axis with
respect to the rotational axis of the star by the angle α, Ω is assumed to be the angular
frequency of the star at the surface, c the light speed, µ0 the vacuum permeability. Now the
dipole nature of the magnetic ﬁeld can be expressed as

B =

µ0|m|
2πR3 ,

(2.2)

when R is the radius (or average radius if it is spheroid) of the star. However, the above
energy loss rate can be deﬁned as the rate of change of rotational kinetic energy of the star
with moment of inertia I so that

(2.3)

(2.4)

I ˙Ω = ˙Erot,

which leads to

Bs =s 15c3IP ˙P

π2R6 sin2 α

G,

when P is the rotational period and ˙P the period derivative. This is the upper limit of Bs.
As P and ˙P for AXPs/SGRs (and WDPs) are known from observation, Bs can be computed
from a given mass-radius (M − R) relation for rotating B-WDs when α is a parameter. Note
that only that M and R (or equatorial radius Re) are the approprite set from the M − R
relation whose surface angular velocity (Ωeq) corresponds to the observed P . Once Bs is
estimated for an observation, the rotational/dipole energy Erot stored in the star can be
computed. This furthermore quantiﬁes the maximum energy stored in it, if there is no other
source as adopted in the magnetar model.

We explore the possibility to explain the origin of high energy phenomena in AXPs/SGRs
and WDPs by ˙Erot and Bs of B-WDs — there is no need to invoke extraordinary, yet ob-
servationally unconﬁrmed, sources of energy. This is possible because B-WDs have larger I
(due to larger R) than NSs, revealing larger m, which is however small enough to produce
UV-luminosity.

The M − R relations of B-WDs depend on the magnetic ﬁeld [17, 19, 26, 28]. It has
been self-consistently found by GRMHD simulations [26, 28] that ﬁeld decreases from the
central region to the surface at least in 2 − 3 orders of magnitude. As Bc plays the major
role in holding the mass [17], an M − R relation corresponds to the strict value(s) of Bc too.
However, Bs is weakly constrained. A range of Bs corresponds to very similar M and R for a
given Bc, as long as Bc/Bs & 103. Nevertheless, from the solution of stellar structure, a given
M and R corresponds to a given Bc and Bs [17, 19], as well as given Ωeq [28] for rotating
stars. On the other hand, for a given observation (P and ˙P ), a particular set of M , R and
Ωeq corresponds to a particular Bs from equation (2.4), which has to be same/similar to the
value of Bs corresponding to the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle giving rise to chosen M and Ωeq in
the ﬁrst place. This helps in removing the apparent degeneracy in Bs with the solution of
stellar structure. For a given M − R relation, only the combinations of M , R and Ωeq, which
satisfy the above constraint of Bs, are useful for explaining AXPs/SGRs and WDPs. This
outlines the rule followed here.

3 Explaining AXPs/SGRs

We consider nine AXPs/SGRs to estimate the range of possible parameters of B-WDs.
We consider two cases separately. First, we consider models with highly magnetized (with
Bc . 5 × 1014 G) B-WDs considering anisotropic eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld self-consistently
formulated in GRMHD simulations [26, 28]. Subsequently, we assume the B-WDs to be very
highly magnetized (with Bc & 1015 G) and follow the respective approximate models [17, 19].

3.1 B-WDs with high magnetic ﬁelds

We consider a typical M − Re relation, as shown in Fig. 20 of [28], described for poloidal
magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles with Bc = 3.1×1014 G, Re ranging in 1534−1586 km and corresponding
Rp/Re in 0.82 − 0.55 (Rp being the polar radius). If the surface temperature is assumed to
be ∼ 104 K, then LU V ∼ 1029 ergs/s. However, a more self-consistent computation reveals
LU V to be much smaller in the presence of ﬁeld considered here [30]. The observed values of
˙P and Lx for nine SGRs/AXPs are given in Table 1. Figure 1 shows that ˙Erot computed
P ,
based on our model in the range 1 ≤ P/sec ≤ 20 is several orders of magnitude larger than
observed Lx for each source. Note that only one point in each curve (corresponding to ﬁxed
˙P ) in Fig. 1a corresponds to the respective source with observed P , when diﬀerent M in the
M − Re relation corresponds to diﬀerent Ωeq and, hence, diﬀerent P . From Fig. 1b we can
retrieve M and, hence Re, corresponding to the respective source.

Figure 2 shows Bs for the respective sources. As above, only one point in each curve
corresponds to the respective source with known P . The values of Bs, along with their Bc,
are conﬁrming these B-WDs to be excellent storage of magnetic energy. The computed Bs
values turn out to be much higher compared to those in C-WDs (see Fig. 3b, which will
be discussed furthermore in §3.2). Hence, the M − Re relation adequately explains all nine
AXPs/SGRs without requiring an extra-ordinary source of magnetic energy.

0418+5729. For other details, see Table 1.

3.2 B-WDs with very high magnetic ﬁelds

Some of the properties of chosen AXPs/SGRs, particularly useful for the present modelling,
are listed in Table 1. We primarily consider α = 15 which is not observationally much
constrained. However, in some sources, α must be smaller in order to explain observed
data better according to our theory. Indeed, α for SGR 0418+5729 has been argued to be
very small [35]. For such sources, a range of α is tabulated, when smaller the α, larger the
allowed mass range of the WD is. However, a larger α reveals a smaller LU V which argues
the WDs to be more diﬃcult to observe. We also assume the surface temperature of WDs
to be TU V ∼ 104 K and set their radius of gyration assuming the WDs to be semi-solid
sphere/ellipsoid.

Figure 3a shows the M −R combinations for B-WDs, which exhibit 100 . ˙Erot/Lx . 107
from equation (2.1) for the AXPs/SGRs listed in Table 1, explaining them well as rotational
powered pulsars. The corresponding LU V appears to be as small as ∼ 1026 ergs s−1 (see
Table 1). Figure 3b along with Table 1, however, shows that the M − R combinations for
the C-WDs exhibit 1 − 4 orders of magnitude higher LU V .

Figures 4a and 4b show that Bs of the B-WDs is quite stronger compared to that of
the C-WDs. This reveals that B-WDs are better storage of rotational/spin-down/magnetic
energy. They naturally explain AXPs/SGRs without requiring an extra-ordinary source of
magnetic energy. Generally higher the Bs and Bc, higher the M is, which corresponds to a
lower R and hence a lower LU V . However, as shown earlier [17], depending on the central
density, a B-WD of lower R with lower M (∼ 1.5M⊙) can be formed. Therefore, for a given
M , LU V for B-WDs could be smaller than that for C-WDs. Figure 5 shows that a B-WD of
M ∼ 1.45M⊙ can have LU V ∼ 1027 ergs s−1 which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the smallest
possible LU V for a C-WD.

Generally (see Table 1), the expected LU V -s of B-WDs are two orders of magnitude lower

be interesting to concentrate on these sources and measure their UV ﬂux and spectrum,
simultaneously with the X-ray spectrum, so that contributions from putative companions
could be subtracted and the real blackbody emission from the compact objects could be
measured and radius be estimated.

4 Explaining GCRT J1745-3009

GCRT J1745-3009 is a transient radio source in the direction of the galactic center, which
exhibited ﬁve peculiar consecutive outbursts at 0.33 GHz with a period of 77.13 minutes.
Zhang and Gil [36] argued it to be a WDP with a period of 77.13 minutes within 0.8 kpc.
Later on, by color-magnitude analysis, Kaplan et al.
[37] showed that WDs with typical
temperatures (5000 − 20, 000 K) and radii (5000 km) could not be this much close to us and
would be at least at around 2 kpc. This challenged the idea of the source to be a WDP.

Now in the framework of very slowly rotating B-WDs (see Figs. 17 and 18 of Ref. [28]) with
Bs ∼ 3.3 × 1011 − 2 × 1012 G, corresponding R ∼ 1580 − 500 km (depending on whether the
magnetic ﬁeld is high or very high) and central density ∼ 1010 gm cm−3, we revisit all the
calculations, e.g. radius of polar cap and unipolar potential drop therein, done by previous
authors [36], and ﬁnd them to be consistent with WDP idea when the unipolar potential
drop is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that in radio pulsars. However, the
emission altitude turns out to be in accordance with radio pulsars for α ∼ 30 and ∼ 15 for
high and very high ﬁelds respectively. Furthermore, the sum of mean free paths for electrons
to produce inverse-Compton gamma-ray photons and for the photons to attenuate turns
out to be larger than the radius of B-WDs, which rules out the possible pair productions
and explains why GCRT J1745-3009 is dormant before and after the bursting cycles. The
maximum gamma-ray/X-ray ﬂux appears to be only a factor of 4 larger than that obtained
by Zhang and Gil [36] for the same parameters for very highly magnetized B-WDs, which is
still quite small to detect. While for highly magnetized cases it appears to be ∼ 100 times
larger than that obtained by previous authors, it is very consistent with the X-ray ﬂux upper
limit of ∼ 5 × 10−10 ergs s−1 cm−2 [38]. Moreover, the solid angle of radio emission is quite
unknown and is a free parameter in order to reduce gamma-ray/X-ray ﬂux furthermore.
Interestingly,

˙P ∼ 10−14 for such B-WDs which is diﬃcult to measure.

Finally, from the condition of radio luminosity not exceeding the spin-down luminosity
reveals the distance of the source to be . 8.5 kpc (for the same solid angle chosen by the
previous authors), for high magnetic ﬁelds, which is much larger than that predicted by
Zhang and Gil [36] and in accordance with the lower limit predicted by Kaplan et al. [37].
For very high magnetic ﬁelds, the distance turns out to be smaller, but still at least ∼ 1.6
kpc which is larger than that predicted by Zhang and Gil [36]. As shown in §3, such B-WDs
are signiﬁcantly cooler and hence being further away than that predicted by Zhang and Gil
[36], its optical ﬂux will be dimmer to evade detection. This strongly supports the source to
be a WDP.

5 Magnetar versus B-WDs

The magnetar hypothesis is around for quite some time and several observational features
of SGRs/AXPs are worked out under the premise of this hypothesis. While attempting to
explain new observations, sometimes new factors in the magnetar hypothesis are invoked,
which, although not proven, are quite plausible. For example, the period derivatives in mag-
netars are often found to vary, sometimes related to other parameters, like, luminosity and
temperature, and these are explained by invoking the torque exerted by the magnetosphere
(see, e.g., [39]). Many of these explanations can possibly be tailored to suit the B-WD
hypothesis, presented in this work.

Instead of embarking on such an adventure, we enumerate here the most fundamental
and basic diﬀerences between the magnetar model prevailing in the literature and the B-
WD hypothesis presented in this paper, to explain the properties of SGRs/ AXPs. Future
observations can be tuned to pin down these diﬀerences which will help in either identifying
the exciting new objects called B-WD or it will strengthen the magnetar hypothesis.

5.1 Narrow period range and rarity of the objects

The narrow period range and the rarity of the SGRs/AXPs is explained in the magnetar
hypothesis as due to the peculiar conditions required to produce the extremely high magnetic

– 9 –

ﬁeld. They form presumably with a very high spin, and, due to the extremely high magnetic
ﬁeld, spin down very fast to the observed range of periods. At longer periods, they are too
weak to be detected. The B-WDs, on the other hand, are rare objects and their formation
may require still rarer constraint of being able to accrete matter from a low mass companion.
The lower period range would be too fast for a WD, whereas at longer periods they could be
undetectable.

The observational consequence of these would be as follows. In the magnetar hypothesis,
there is a rare possibility of detecting SGRs/AXPs with fast rotation (signiﬁcantly less than a
second), whereas such objects would not be possible in the B-WD hypothesis. Furthermore,
in the magnetar hypothesis, there should be a large number of high magnetic ﬁeld long
period NSs with quite weak emission.
In the B-WD hypothesis, however, slowly rotating
high magnetic WDs could be detected as the progenitors of peculiar Type Ia Supernovae.

5.2 Origin and age

Magnetars necessarily have to be young and should be associated with a young supernova
remnant (SNR). If one measures the space velocities of SGRs/AXPs, from the measured age,
one should be able to identify the recent SNR for each and every SGR/AXP. The B-WDs
would be preferentially seen in dense stellar regions (so that the peculiar high magnetic ﬁeld
WDs capture a low mass companion and increase their core magnetic ﬁeld by accretion), but
they need not be associated with SNR.

5.3 Companion and relic accretion disks

In the B-WD hypothesis, one of the methods to generate higher Bc is by accretion and the
resultant ﬂux freezing in WDs. Hence if B-WDs are the central sources in SGRs/AXPs,
some of these objects may retain a low mass companion and/or relic accretion disks. Being a
recently born NS in a supernova, no such companion or relic accretion disk should be found
in SGRs/AXPs, in the magnetar hypothesis.

5.4 Size

One of the most fundamental diﬀerences in the two models is the size of the compact object.
In the magnetar hypothesis, they are NSs with a size of 8 − 10 km. In the B-WD hypothesis,
they can have a wide range of size ranging from a few tens of km to a few thousands km.
A detailed modelling and understanding of the X-ray spectral components should be able to
resolve the source size.

5.5 Capability of measuring magnetic ﬁelds by latest experiments

Recently launched ASTROSAT and Hitomi satellites are capable of detecting hard X-rays
of energy upto ∼ 100 keV. Hence, they are expected to observe more sources with the
capabilities of wide band spectroscopy. Now the electron Cyclotron resonance energy of
absorption spectrum is to be Ec = 11.6 (Bs/1012 G) keV. Therefore, a compact object with
Bs ∼ 1012 −1013 G is possible to be observed by ASTROSAT/LAXPC and could be identiﬁed
as a B-WD. However, for a NS based magnetar with Bs & 1014 G, Ec & 1000 keV, which is
quite beyond the scope of these satellites.

6 Summary and Implications

We have demonstrated important applications of recently formulated B-WDs [17–19, 21]. The
present work indicates a possibility of wide application of B-WDs in modern astrophysics.
The idea that AXPs/SGRs need sources of energy other than accretion is certainly inevitable,
but the hypothesis that they are highly magnetic NSs, although attractive, did not neatly
ﬁt in with furthermore observations (unlike other ideas in Astrophysics, like, spinning NSs
as radio pulsars and accreting compact objects as X-ray binaries, which quickly established
themselves as paradigms). Apart from the limitations of the magnetar model discussed
earlier, the model does not have natural explanation of several observed features, like, the
narrow period range (and several orders of magnitude range in period derivative), lack of
large proper motion, lack of supernova identiﬁcation for all AXPs/SGRs etc. Hence, it is
very important that other possible explanations for the AXP/SGR phenomena, at least a
part of them, need to be seriously explored. The B-WD concept is an extremely attractive
alternate for AXPs/SGRs. This is because of its range of mass and radius to satisfy diﬀerent
observations.

Recently, the source 1E 2259+586 has been reported to exhibit an anti-glitch [40]. While
the presence of glitch has been explained in the theory of NS, an anti-glitch is diﬃcult to argue
under the same framework. We, however, can speculatively describe it in B-WDs as follows.
As we argued earlier, an equilibrium B-WD will have a larger interior ﬁeld which decays
(starting from the core-crust boundary) down away from the center [20]. However, B-WDs
are expected to encounter continuous mass-loss, along with the decay of its angular velocity
and magnetic ﬁeld exhibiting rotational power. Now, when the surface ﬁeld decays below
a critical value, the stiﬀness of the ﬁeld proﬁle increases signiﬁcantly enough to produce an
outward force arising from the additional gradient of magnetic pressure, say ∼ 2 × 1011 ergs
cm−3 at a radius ∼ 600 km with a density ∼ 109 gm cm−3. This in turn leads to the increase of
the stellar radius in equilibrium and, from the conservation of angular momentum, a decrease
of the frequency with an anti-glitch ∼ −4.5 × 10−8 Hz as observed. Furthermore, above a
critical time scale, the density will decrease appreciably to decrease the inner magnetic ﬁeld
due to continuous mass-loss, when the outer ﬁeld has been already smaller. This in turn
decreases the stiﬀness of the ﬁeld proﬁle and hence the gradient of magnetic pressure. As a
result, this leads to the gravitational power to be suddenly stronger to exhibit glitch. This
cycle may continue depending on the competitive powers between mass-loss and rotational
energy extraction rates.

Another important application of B-WDs has been explaining the peculiar radio tran-
sient GCRT J1745-3009 as a WDP. While earlier authors indeed argued it to be a WDP,
subsequently it was ruled out based on a more accurate prediction of its distance in the
framework of a C-WD. However, considering it to be a B-WD furthermore opens up its pos-
sibility of a WDP, due B-WDs’ larger magnetic ﬁeld and smaller radius which could predict
it to be low luminous and further away and hence dimmer to evade detection.

Now, in order to verify the usefulness of B-WDs, it is important to reﬁne X-ray spectro-
scopic tools to measure the mass and radius of the compact objects in AXPs/SGRs. In the
calculations described in this work, we could only derive a range of possible magnetic ﬁeld
related to the corresponding mass and radius for a given source based on the observed P and
˙P . If, observationally, some parameters could be tied to either mass or radius (even mag-
netic ﬁeld, e.g. by electron Cyclotron absorption line, which would be in the X-ray regime,
unlike the gamma-ray regime of NS based model), then unique solutions and hence deﬁnite

– 11 –

predictions can be made based on the B-WD model.
In the larger astrophysical context,
it is important to examine various observations in the light of the existence of B-WDs and
their creation by the phenomena of ﬂux-freezing. For example, the fact that in the SDSS
survey, the magnetic WDs are found to have, on an average, larger mass compared to the
non-magnetic WDs [29] can be explained naturally if we assume that the magnetic WDs are
generated by accretion (and the resultant contraction in radius and ﬂux freezing). Similarly,
magnetic WDs in cataclysmic variables (CVs) have higher ﬁeld strength below their period
gap (which are evolved systems), again, comes naturally from the fact that evolved WDs,
due to accretion, should have larger mass, lower radius, and higher magnetic ﬁeld. Finally,
a precise mass measurement of evolved CVs should identify a few of them as B-WDs.
