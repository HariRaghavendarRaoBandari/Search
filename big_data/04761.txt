In this work, we estimate the masses of tetraquark states with four diﬀerent ﬂavors by virtue of QCD sum
rules, in both b and c sectors. We construct four [8c]¯bs ⊗ [8c] ¯du tetraquark currents with JP = 0+, and then
perform analytic calculation up to dimension eight in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). We keep terms
which are linear in the strange quark mass ms, and in the end ﬁnd two possible tetraquark states with masses
(5.57± 0.15) and (5.58± 0.15) GeV, which are both close to the recent DØ observation of charged X(5568). We
ﬁnd that their charmed-partner masses lie in (2.54 ± 0.13) and (2.55 ± 0.13) GeV, respectively and are hence
accessible in experiments like BESIII and Belle.

INTRODUCTION

sπ±, B0

Very recently, the DØ Collaboration has reported the ﬁrst
observation of a narrow structure, call X(5568), in the de-
cay chain X(5568) → B0
s → J/ψφ, J/ψ → µ+µ−,
φ → K+K− based on the p ¯p collision data at √s = 1.96 TeV
collected at the Fermilab Tevatron collider [1]. Its mass and
width were respectively measured to be MX = 5567.8±2.9+0.9
−1.9
MeV and ΓX = 21.9 ± 6.4+5.0
−2.5 MeV, and the favored quan-
tum number is JP = 0+. The statistical signiﬁcance including
the look-elsewhere eﬀect and systematic errors is about 5.1
σ. The decay ﬁnal state B0
sπ+ indicate that the component of
X(5568) has to be su¯b ¯d, and this is the ﬁrst observation of
a hadronic state with four diﬀerent ﬂavors. As pointed out
in Ref.[1], considering the large mass diﬀerence between the
mass of the X(5568) and the sum of B0
s and π0, it is diﬃcult
to understand the X(5568) as a molecular bound state with B0
s
and π+.

The observation of X(5568) has immediately inspired ex-
tensive discussions on the possibility of its internal structure.
Very recently, authors investigated the X(5568) as a scalar
tetraquark state using the approach of QCD sum rules [2–
6]. Meanwhile, in Ref.[7], authors constructed a series of
tetraquark currents to calculate the corresponding mass in the
framework of QCD sum rules, and their results support the
X(5568) as a tetraquark state with quantum numbers JP = 0+
or 1+. Wang and Zhu [8] employed the eﬀective Hamilto-
nian approach to calculate the mass of the tetraquark state.
The molecular picture of Xb was carried out in Ref.[9] us-
ing the QCD sum rules, where the Xb(5568) was taken as
the B ¯K bound states. Assumed the X(5568) as the S-wave
B ¯K molecular state, Xiao and Chen discussed the decay of
X(5568) → B0
sπ+ in Ref. [10]. Besides, a number of works
that analyze this exotic X(5568) were accomplished based on
other theoretical methods [11–14].

It should be noted that according to the Quantum Chro-
modynamics (QCD), there exists a tetraquark conﬁguration,
which is composed of two color-octet parts. Since there exits
QCD interaction, it is diﬀerent from the molecular state with
two color-singlet mesons. That is to say, it could decay to
two mesons by exchanging one or more gluons. Therefore,
the study of the color-octet tetraquark state is very important
to reveal the internal structure of the new hadron states, for
example, the newly observed charged X(5568). This is our
motivation for this work.

In this work, we will construct four color-octet tetraquark
currents , and use the QCD sum rules to calculate their masses.
Then, we will discuss the possibility to explain the newly ob-
served charged X(5568) as a tetraquark state.

Primary formulae are presented after the introduction. In
Sec.III, the numerical results and related ﬁgures are shown.
The last section is a short summary.

II. FORMALISM

We study the color-octet tetraquark state with JP = 0+ via
QCD Sum Rules [16–19] in this work. The calculations of the
QCD sum rules are based on the correlator constructed by two
hadronic currents. For a scalar state, the two-point correlation
function is given by

where j(x) is a current with the quantum number JP = 0+:

(1)

Π(q2) = iZ d4xeiq·xh0|T(cid:8) j(x) j†(0)(cid:9)|0i ,
jA(x) =(cid:20)i ¯b j(x)γ5(ta) jksk(x)(cid:21)(cid:20)i ¯dm(x)γ5(ta)mnun(x)(cid:21) ,
jB(x) =(cid:20)¯b j(x)(ta) jk sk(x)(cid:21)(cid:20) ¯dm(x)(ta)mnun(x)(cid:21) ,

where j, k, m, and n are color indices, ta is the generator of the
group S Uc(3). Here, the subscripts A, B, C, and D represent

the currents composed of two 0− color-octet parts, two 0+,
two 1−, and two 1+, respectively. We will take into account all
these currents in the following calculation.

The fundamental assumption of the QCD sum rules is the
principle of quark-hadron duality. Accordingly, on the one
hand, the correlation function Π(q2) is obtained at the hadron
level where the mass and coupling constant of the hadron are
introduced. It may be calculated at the quark-gluon level, in
which the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is employed.
To evaluate the spectral density of the OPE side, the “full”
propagators S q
i j(p) of a light quark (q = u, d or s)
and a heavy quark (Q = c or b) are respectively written with
the vacuum condensates clearly displayed as follows:

To consider the eﬀects induced by the mass of the strange

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the numerical calculation, the values of the conden-
sates and the quark masses are used as [4, 7, 16–20]:mu =
md = 0, ms(2GeV) = (95 ± 5) MeV, mc(mc) = ¯mc =
(1.275 ± 0.025) GeV, mb(mb) = ¯mb = (4.18 ± 0.03) GeV,
h¯qqi = −(0.24±0.01)3 GeV3, h ¯ssi = (0.8±0.1)h¯qqi, hg2
sG2i =
sG3i = 0.045 GeV6, and
0.88 GeV4, h ¯sgsσ · Gsi = m2
0h ¯ssi, hg3
0 = 0.8 GeV2. Here, ¯mc and ¯mb are the running masses of
m2
the heavy quarks in the MS scheme.

To determinate the Borel parameter M2

B and the threshold
parameter s0, we used the following limit constraints, which
is the standard procedure for QCD sum rules analysis. In the
QCD sum rules, for choosing the threshold s0 and the param-
eter M2
B, there are two criteria [16, 17, 19]. First, the conver-
gence of the OPE is retained. Therefore, in order to determine
their convergence, one needs to compare the relative contri-
butions of each term to the total contributions of the OPE

side. The second criterion to constrain the M2
B is that the pole
contribution (PC), deﬁned as the pole contribution divided by
the total contribution (pole plus continuum), is larger than the
continuum contribution. In order to safely eliminate the con-
tributions of the higher excited and continuum states, the PC
is generally greater than 50% [19, 21].

To ﬁnd a proper value for √s0, we carry out a similar anal-
ysis as in Refs. [22, 23]. Since the continuum threshold is
connected to the mass of the studied state by the relation
√s0 ∼ (MX + δ) GeV, where δ is in the range of 0.4 ∼ 0.8
GeV, various √s0 satisfying this constraint are taken into ac-
count. Among these values, one needs then to ﬁnd out the
proper one which has an optimal window for Borel parameter
M2
B. That is, within this window, the physical quantity, here
the tetraquark mass MX, is independent of the Borel parame-
ter M2
B as much as possible. Through the above procedure one
obtains the central value of √s0. However, in practice, in the
QCD sum rules calculation, it is normally acceptable to vary
the √s0 by 0.1 ∼ 0.2 GeV [24, 25], which gives the lower and
upper bounds and hence the uncertainties of √s0.

diﬀerent limit constraints of M2
B. To determine the value of
s0, an analysis similar to Ref. [21] was carried out. The de-

However, we ﬁnd there doesn’t exist a reasonable region

can conclude that these two cases do not correspond to any
tetraquark states.

Eventually, the masses of the tetraquark states with currents

A and C are determined to be

where the mass with the optimal stability is extracted with
errors stemming from the uncertainties of the quark mass, the
condensates, the Borel parameter and the threshold parameter
√s0.

Moreover, we predict their charmed partners with masses

of (2.54 ± 0.13) and (2.55 ± 0.13) GeV, respectively.

IV. SUMMARY

In this work, we estimate the masses of tetraquark states
with four diﬀerent ﬂavors by virtue of QCD sum rules, in both
b and c sectors. We construct four [8c]¯bs ⊗ [8c] ¯du tetraquark
currents with JP = 0+, and then perform analytic calculation

linear in the strange quark mass ms.

The numerical results are respectively (5.57 ± 0.13) GeV
and (5.58 ± 0.13) GeV for case A and C. However, due to the
lack of reasonable windows of the Borel parameter M2
B, case
B and D do not correspond any hadron states. Our results
indicate that two S-wave octet parts can form a resonance,
whereas two P-wave octet parts are not able to form a reso-
nance. Therefore, we can conclude that two [8c]¯bs ⊗ [8c] ¯du
tetraquark states with JP = 1+ should exist and have a de-
generate mass. Detailed analysis will be presented in our next
work.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd two possible tetraquark states with
masses (5.57 ± 0.15) and (5.58 ± 0.15) GeV, which are both
close to the recent DØ observation of charged X(5568). We
ﬁnd that their charmed-partner masses lie in (2.54± 0.13) and
(2.55 ± 0.13) GeV, respectively and are hence accessible in
experiments like BESIII and Belle.
