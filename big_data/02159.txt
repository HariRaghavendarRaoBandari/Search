Entanglement rules for holographic Fermi surfaces

Abstract

In this paper, based on the notion of Gauge/Gravity duality, we explore the
laws of entanglement thermodynamics for most generic classes of Quantum Field
Theories with hyperscaling violation. In our analysis, we note that for Quantum
Field Theories with compressible quark like excitation, the ﬁrst law of entanglement
thermodynamics gets modiﬁed due to the presence of an additional term that could
be identiﬁed as the entanglement chemical potential associated with hidden Fermi
surfaces of the boundary theory. Most notably, we ﬁnd that the so called entangle-
ment chemical potential does not depend on the size of the entangling region and
is purely determined by the quark d.o.f. encoded within the entangling region.

1 Overview and Motivation

In the recent years, the holographic models for non relativistic Quantum Field Theories
with hyperscaling violation [1]-[12] has been found to provide an excellent theoretical
framework in order to describe compressible states of quark matter (distributed over the
so called hidden Fermi surfaces) at strong coupling [13]-[15]. It turns out that for theories
with holographic metals [16]-[17], the total charge density (associated with the boundary
theory) largely dominates over that of the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces.
In
[18]-[19], the authors argue that such a deﬁcit could be made up by considering hidden
Fermi surfaces of fractionalized deconﬁned charged fermionic excitation known as quarks.
In a recent paper [13], the authors ﬁrst pointed out that the presence of such compress-
ible states of quark matter could be identiﬁed by computing the holographic entanglement
entropy (HEE) [20]-[21] for the boundary theory, which instead of showing the usual area
divergence, exhibits the so called logarithmic divergence. These arguments were further
sharpened by the authors in [14], who showed that an emerging infra-red geometry with
arbitrary dynamic exponent (z) and hyperscaling violating parameter (θ) precisely char-
acterizes the presence of such compressible quark matter excitation distributed over the
hidden Fermi surfaces of the boundary theory.

The most natural question that arises in this context is whether there exists any notion
of so called entanglement thermodynamics [22]-[30] for small subsystems associated with
these hidden Fermi surfaces of compressible quark excitation. In other words, whether

one could possibly write down some version of the ﬁrst law of entanglement thermody-
namics in the presence of these fractionalized charged fermionic excitation. Now, in the
presence of these additional quantum numbers (fermionic d.o.f.), the ﬁrst law of entan-
glement thermodynamics must be modiﬁed in order to include a term which should be
analogous to that of the chemical potential term associated with the standard ﬁrst law
of thermodynamic. The question therefore turns out to be whether one could deﬁne such
an entity (which we call entanglement chemical potential) associated with hidden Fermi
surfaces that leads to a modiﬁed ﬁrst law of entanglement thermodynamics and if such
an entity exits then whether it is universal in the same sense as that of the entanglement
temperature. The purpose of the present article is to provide a systematic answer to these
questions based on some concrete holographic computations.

The organisation of the paper is the following: In Section 2, we provide details re-
garding the gravitational set up in the bulk. In Section 3, we explore the modiﬁed ﬁrst
law of entanglement thermodynamics and compute the entanglement chemical potential
associated with compressible states of quark matter. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

2 The background

We start our analysis with a formal description to the gravitational solution in the bulk
spacetime. The action that typically one considers is of the following form [31],

where, H 2 = HmnH mn and F 2 = FmnF mn are the ﬁeld strength tensors corresponding to
two abelian one forms Bm and Am respectively. The ﬁrst abelian two form (Hmn) coupled
with the dilaton (Φ) generates the desired asymptotic solution of the Lifshitz type. On the
other hand, the second Maxwell ﬁeld (Fmn) gives rise to the non linear charged Lifshitz
black brane conﬁguration. Here, V (Φ)(= −2ΛeγΦ) is the so called exponential potential
for the dilaton.

To proceed further, in our analysis we set d = 2. With this the resulting expression
for (non linear) charged hyperscaling violating Lifshitz conﬁguration turns out to be1[31],

the moment we skip details regarding the gauge ﬁelds as well as the dilation proﬁle as they are not
directly required for the present analysis. Interested reader may have a look for their details in [31].

Before we proceed further, let us ﬁrst adopt some suitable radial coordinate (variable)
namely, u = rH/r such that the horizon of the black brane is placed at u = 1 and the
boundary of the space time is located near u → 0. With this choice of coordinates, the

3 Entanglement thermodynamics

The holographic deﬁnition of entanglement entropy could be formally expressed as [20],

SA =

Area(γA)

4GN

(7)

where, γA is the measure of the minimal area of the surface that ends on the boundary.
In order to compute the holgraphic entanglement entropy (HEE), we consider our
subsystem to be a strip of size, V2 = Ll where, 0 < x < l and −L/2 < y < L/2 such
2Although throughout this paper we would try to keep our analysis to be most generic, however,
since the ultimate goal of our analysis is to explore the entanglement thermodynamics associated with
the (hidden) Fermi surfaces of the boundary theory, therefore, in our analysis we would ﬁnally set,
θ = d − 1 = 1 [13]-[14] along with, z = 2 and s = 1. Our choice of s precisely corresponds to the fact
that we are dealing with the linear Maxwell theory instead that of the Power Maxwell theory which we
had started with. However, one could in principle choose other values of s as well and that should not
aﬀect any of the physical consequences of the theory.

In order to proceed further we ﬁrst consider the uncharged case namely, Q = 0. Under
such circumstances, turning on M essentially corresponds to thermal excitation about
the Fermi sea. Considering l to be very small (i.e, uT /rH (cid:28) 1) and expanding f (u)
perturbatively in M, from (9) we ﬁnd,

Eq.(16) precisely determines the universal entanglement temperature associated with
so called Fermi surfaces of the boundary theory at strong coupling and zero chemical
potential. The value of the universal constant c(F ) is ﬁxed by the shape of the entangling
region, which for the present example turns out to be the thin rectangular strip.

In the next subsection, we move on to the scenario with ﬁnite chemical potential which
allows us to consider situations like exciting the system by creating particles even at zero
temperature and therefore to check the validity of the laws of entanglement thermody-
namics associated with Fermi surfaces at ﬁnite chemical potential.

3.2 Case II: Q (cid:54)= 0

In this section, we explore the entanglement thermodynamics associated with (hidden)
Fermi surfaces in the presence of additional conserved (global U (1)) charges and/or ﬁnite
number density of particles in the theory. There could be two possible scenarios under
such circumstances namely, one could consider the change in entanglement entropy due
to the change in temperature at ﬁnite charge density and vice versa. In the following we
consider them one by one.
We ﬁrst compute the change in the HEE due to the change in temperature (TH) at
ﬁxed quark number density (NA) encoded within the subsystem (A). To do that, we ﬁrst
note down the entity, ∆SA at ﬁnite temperature and charge density,

is the most general form of the entanglement chemical potential associated with holo-
graphic Lifshitz theories in the presence of hyperscaling violation. Eq.(29), therefore
suggests that for generic hyperscaling violating theories (with arbitrary z and θ) the en-
tanglement chemical potential is universal, namely it is determined by the size of the
entangling region,

µE ∼ NAlz−θ−1.

(30)

However, we encounter a surprise for a theory with holographic (hidden) Fermi surfaces
(with, z = 2 and θ = 1), where we ﬁnd that unlike the case for the entanglement tem-
perature, the entanglement chemical potential does not at all depend on the size of the
entangling region namely,

µ(F )
E =

(31)

which therefore suggests that the entanglement chemical potential associated with hidden
Fermi surfaces of compressible quark matter is directly proportional to the total number
of quark excitation encoded within the entangling region. Therefore, this leads to the fol-
lowing conclusion that for suﬃciently small entangling regions, the entanglement chemical
potential associated with (holographic) Fermi surfaces is independent that of the size of
the entangling region and is determined solely due to the fractionalized fermionic d.o.f.
associated with compressible quark matter distributed over the hidden Fermi surfaces.

4 Summary and ﬁnal remarks

We now summarize the key ﬁndings of our analysis. In the present paper, we consider
holographic models that describe compressible quark like excitation distributed over hid-
den Fermi surfaces of the boundary theory and explore the laws of entanglement thermo-
dynamics associated with small subsystems in such a conﬁguration. The upshot of our
analysis is the following: We note that in the presence of fermionic excitation, one could
associate quantities like entanglement chemical potential with that of the hidden Fermi
surfaces of the theory and indeed write down a modiﬁed version of the usual entanglement
thermodynamics. Throughout this paper we keep our analysis to be most generic. How-
ever, as a surprise, for small entangling regions, we note that the so called entanglement
chemical associated with compressible quark excitation does not depend on the size of
the entangling region and is solely determined by the total number of quark excitation

7

encoded within that subsystem. This turns out to be the main result of our analysis
and it clearly categories a theory with hidden Fermi surfaces into a separate universality
class from that of the other non conformal theories those have been studied earlier in the
literature [28].
