Some physical systems like the quantum mechanics with magnetic charges or ﬁeld theoretical
models appearing in the context of string theory are formulated in terms of non-associative al-
gebras. Hence, demand non-associative star products for its description. However, unlike its
associative counterpart the situation with non-associative star products is quite unclear. At the
moment it is not evident which condition should be used instead of the associativity in the def-
inition of the non-associative star multiplication. In mathematics, the natural generalization of
the associativity is the requirement that the multiplication should be alternative, the associator
of three elements should vanish if each two of them are equal. We show that for the alternative
closed star product the integrated associator vanishes. In particular, it means that on-shell there
will be no violation of associativity in string scattering amplitudes. We discuss the examples of
the alternative and closed star products. It is constructed the star product corresponding to the
algebra of octonions.

1. Introduction

Star product is an important mathematical tool in theoretical physics with inumerous appli-
cations. Originally it appeared in the context of deformation quantization approach to quantum
mechanics (QM) [1] and is deﬁned as a formal deformation of the usual point-wise multiplication
of smooth functions on some manifold M ,

f ⋆ g = f · g +

(ia )rCr( f ,g) ,

r=1

(1.1)

is a deformation parameter and Cr denote some bi-differential operators. This product

where a
provides a quantization of the bracket, { f ,g} = Pi j(x)¶ i f ¶ jg, if
C1( f ,g)−C1(g, f ) = 2{ f ,g} .

(1.2)

In the classical setting, the associativity of star products, i.e., the requirement that the associator of
any three functions should vanish,

A( f ,g,h) = f ⋆ (g ⋆ h)− ( f ⋆ g) ⋆ h = 0 ,

(1.3)

reﬂects the associativity of compositions of quantum mechanical operators. The condition (1.3)
implies the Jacobi identity (JI) on the bi-vector ﬁeld Pi j(x) and allows to proceed to higher orders,
Cr( f ,g), r > 1. A milestone result in deformation quantization is the Formality Theorem by Kont-
sevich [2] that demonstrates the existence of associative star products and states that each two star
products ⋆ and ⋆′ corresponding to the same Poisson (i.e., satisfying JI) bi-vector Pi j(x) are related
by the gauge transformation

f ⋆′ g = D−1 (D f ⋆ Dg) , D = 1 + O(a ) .

(1.4)

Gauge equivalence classes of star products are classiﬁed by Poisson structures on M .

The interest to star products was boosted by the discovery [3, 4] that the coordinates of string
endpoints attached to a Dirichlet brane in a background B-ﬁeld do not commute, and thefore, star
products are natural to describe correlation functions.
It was found a bit later [5, 6, 7], that in
a non-constant B-ﬁeld, the product should be not only noncommutative, but also nonassociative.
More recently, similar effects were discovered in the closed string sector.
It was demonstrated
[8, 9, 10, 11] that the presence of a non-geometric R-ﬂux leads to a twist of the Poisson structure
and to nonasociativity of corresponding star products. Note, that the mechanism of breaking the
associativity is very similar to the one that was found in the background of a magnetic monopole
[12]. An extended discussion on the relations between the magnetic ﬁeld and the nonassociativity
may be found in [13].

Despite this renewed interest the overall situation with non-Poisson structures and nonassocia-
tive star products remains by far less clear than with their associative counterparts. In this case, the
condition (1.2) can still be imposed, but it is unclear which restriction should be used instead of the
associativity (1.3) to deﬁne the higher order terms in (1.1). Why, for instance, one cannot simply
set, Cr( f ,g) = 0, r > 1, and deﬁne the star product as

f ⋆0 g = f · g + ia { f ,g}?

To answer this question, it is reasonable to follow the standard logic of deformation quantization
and to search for the physical restrictions on the nonassociative models. The requirement that
the physical measurements should not feel the violation of the associativity may serve as such a
restriction. In string theory it can be achieved if, on-shell, when the string equation of motion are
satisﬁed, the integrated associator vanishes, see [7, 14].

In the next section we show that for the closed alternative star product the integrated associator
of three smooth functions, vanishing on the inﬁnity, vanishes. The star product is called closed, if
for Schwartz functions f and g, we have

Z f ⋆ g = Z f · g.

(1.6)

The multiplication map is alternative if the associator vanishes whenever two of its arguments
are equal. It means that the associator of any three elements A( f ,g,h) must be totally antisym-
metric. Since, any associative algebra is automatically alternative, the later condition is a natural
generalization of the associativity. In particular, the star product (1.5) is closed with appropriate
integration measure, but it is not alternative. One may check that for this star multiplication the
integrated associator will not vanish. So, it is not suitable for our aims.

We discuss the existence of the alternative star products corresponding to the arbitrary anti-
symmetric bi-vector Pi j(x). Then we show that the requirement for the star product to be alternative
is invariant under the gauge transformations (1.4), just like it happens in the associative case. Dif-
ferent star products providing quantization of the same bracket reﬂect different quantization pre-
scriptions of the same classical model. Physical consequences of each choice of the quantization
scheme may be different, however the basic principles of the consistency must be the same. That is
why, it is important that the condition restricting the higher order terms in (1.1) should distinguish
the whole class of admissible quantizations.

We consider the examples of alternative and non-associative star products. In the Sec. 3, it
is proposed the explicit expression of the star product corresponding to the algebra of octonions.
Then we provide the gauge transformation D relating this star product to the closed one. Finally,
in the Sec. 4, we discuss the general case of bi-vector Pi j(x). First we describe the construction of
non-associative weakly-Hermitian (i.e., satisfying, (x j ⋆ f )∗ = f ∗ ⋆ x j, for all x j) Weyl star product
[15] and show that it is weakly alternative, meaning that the associator A(xi,x j,xk) is totally anti-
symmetric. Our conjecture is that the Hermitian, ( f ⋆g)∗ = g∗ ⋆ f ∗, Weyl star product is alternative,
A( f ,g,h) is antisymmetric for any functions f , g and h. Then we derive the ﬁrst orders of the gauge
operator D mapping the proposed star product to the closed one. Thus, in lowest orders we give the
explicit formulas for the closed alternative star product providing quantization of a (non)-Poisson

bracket { f ,g} = Pi j(x)¶ i f ¶ jg.
2. Alternative star products

Deﬁnition. According to the above given deﬁnition, the star product is alternative if the asso-

ciator of any three functions vanishes whenever two of them are equal, i.e.,

A( f , f ,g) = 0,
A(g, f , f ) = 0.

These two identities together imply that the associator A( f ,g,h) must be totally antisymmetric. On
the other hand, the Jacobiator,

[ f ,g,h]⋆ = [ f , [g,h]⋆]⋆ + [h, [ f ,g]⋆]⋆ + [g, [h, f ]⋆]⋆,

(2.2)

where [ f ,g]⋆ stands for the star commutator is antisymmetric by deﬁnition. Also, the deﬁnitions
(1.3) and (2.2) mean that

[ f ,g,h]⋆ = A( f ,g,h)− A( f ,h,g) + A(h, f ,g)− A(h,g, f ) + A(g,h, f )− A(g, f ,h).

(2.3)

Since, for the alternative star product the associator should be totally antisymmetric, one ﬁnds

f ⋆ (g ⋆ h)− ( f ⋆ g) ⋆ h =

1
6

[ f ,g,h]⋆, ∀ f ,g,h.

(2.4)

That is, the star product is alternative if and only if the relation (2.4) holds.

Existence. The ﬁrst point we would like to address here is whenever the alternative star
product exists for each non-Poisson bracket (1.2), or the equation (2.4) implies some restrictions
on the bi-vector Pi j(x). The eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) give

{ f ,g} =

f ⋆ g− g ⋆ f

2ia

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a =0

.

(2.5)

For the associative star products the equation (1.3) already in the second order, O(a 2), implies the
JI,

{ f ,{g,h}} +{h,{ f ,g}} +{g,{h, f}} = 0,

(2.6)

which is the consistency condition in this case. It happens that no other restrictions appear and on
any Poisson manifold there exists an associative star product [2].

Applying the same logic to the alternative star multiplication and using the condition (2.4)

instead of the associativity equation (1.3) we end up with

{ f ,{g,h}} +{h,{ f ,g}} +{g,{h, f}} =

[ f ,g,h]⋆
−a 2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a =0

,

(2.7)

which is nothing but the identity due to (1.1), (1.2) and (2.2). Apparently, in the lower orders the
alternative star products do not imply any restriction on the antisymmetric bi-vector Pi j(x). To
prove the existence of the star product in all orders one may provide an explicit construction for
it. The candidate of such a construction is the Weyl star product [15] which we discuss in the last
section.

Gauge invariance. Suppose that the star products ⋆ and ⋆′ are related by the gauge transfor-

mation (1.4). Let us calculate

A′( f ,g,h) = f ⋆′ (g ⋆′ h)− ( f ⋆′ g) ⋆′ h

= D−1(cid:8)D f ⋆ D(cid:2)D−1 (Dg ⋆ Dh)(cid:3)(cid:9)− D−1(cid:8)D(cid:2)D−1 (D f ⋆ Dg)(cid:3) ⋆ Dh(cid:9) .

Since, the gauge operator D is linear, one ﬁnds

A′( f ,g,h) = D−1A(D f , Dg, Dh) .

4

(2.8)

(2.9)

Alternative multiplications

Vladislav Kupriyanov

For the Jacobiators, calculated with respect to the ⋆ and ⋆′, one ﬁnds the similar relation,

[ f ,g,h]⋆′ = D−1[D f , Dg, Dh]⋆ .

(2.10)

The combination of (2.9) and (2.10) gives

[ f ,g,h]⋆′ − 6A′( f ,g,h) = D−1 [[D f , Dg, Dh]⋆ − 6A(D f , Dg, Dh)] = 0,

(2.11)
because of the equation (2.4) and the invertibility of the operator D = 1 + O(a ). This means
that the alternativity condition is invariant under the gauge transformations (1.4). The situation is
similar to the associative case.

Integration. The deﬁnition of the consistent trace functional (integration) on the algebra of
functions endowed with a star product is an important problem. Obviously, for the closed star

products, R f ⋆ g = R f · g, the integrated star commutator and the integrated Jacobiator vanish. If

the star product is also alternative, due to the deﬁnition (2.4),
Z ( f ⋆ g) ⋆ h = Z f ⋆ (g ⋆ h).

(2.12)

For the alternative closed star product the integrated associator vanishes. This result is of great
importance in physics, see e.g. [7, 14]. In particular, it means that on-shell, i.e. if the string equation
of motion are satisﬁed, there will be no violation of associativity in string scattering amplitudes.

Examples. As it was already mentioned in the introduction, any associative star product is

automatically alternative, it can be considered as a trivial example.

The following algebra of brackets appears in the context of both ﬂat non-geometric R-ﬂux in

string theory and QM with magnetic charges,

{xi,x j} = Ri jk pk, {xi, p j} = d i

j, {pi, p j} = 0,

(2.13)

where Ri jk is totally antisymmetric and i, j,k = 1,2,3. In [16] it was demonstrated that the corre-
sponding to (2.13) star product,

f ⋆p g = m 2(cid:18)exp(cid:20) ia

2

Ri jk pk¶ i ⊗ ¶ j(cid:21)exp(cid:20) ia

2

(¶ i ⊗ ˜¶ i − ˜¶ i⊗ ¶ i)(cid:21) f ⊗ g(cid:19) ,

(2.14)

where m 2 is a point-wise multiplication map, and ˜¶ i = ¶ /¶ pi, satisfy the requirement (2.4), i.e., it
is alternative. Then in [17] it was shown that (2.14) is closed and satisfy (2.12). In the terminology
of [17] the properties (1.6) and (2.12) are refered to as 2-cyclicity and 3-cyclicity correspondingly.

3. Star product for octonions

Probably, the most known example of the alternative, but non-associative algebra are the oc-

tonions. Every octonion X can be written in the form

X = X0e0 + X1e1 + X2e2 + X3e3 + X4e4 + X5e5 + X6e6 + X7e7,

(3.1)

where Xi are the real coefﬁcients, e0 is the scalar element, and the imaginary unit octonions ei
satisfy the following multiplication rule:

eie j = −d i je0 + e i jkek,

5

(3.2)

Alternative multiplications

Vladislav Kupriyanov

with e i jk being a completely antisymmetric tensor of the rank three with a positive value +1 when
i jk = 123, 145, 176, 246, 257, 347, 365, and i, j,k = 1 . . . 7. The octonions are neither commutative,
nor associative. The commutator algebra of the octonions is given by

In seven dimensions one has

[ei,e j] := eie j − e jei = 2e i jkek.

e i jke lmk = d ild jm − d imd jl + e i jlm,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where e i jlm is a completely antisymmetric tensor of the rank four with a positive value +1 when
i jlm = 1247, 1265, 1436, etc., One may also represent the tensor with four indices e i jlm as a dual
to the tensor with three indices e kpr through

e i jlm =

1
6

e i jlmkpre kpr,

(3.5)

where e i jlmkpr is the Levi-Civita symbol in seven dimensions, normalized as e 1234567 = +1, see e.g.
[18] for details. Taking into account (3.4), for the Jacobiator we get

[ei, [e j,ek]] + cycl(i jk) = 6e i jklel.

In this section we are interested in the quantization of the bracket:

{xi,x j} = e i jkxk,

i, j,k = 1 . . . 7,

(3.6)

(3.7)

representing the algebra of imaginary octonions.

Vector star product. In [19] in three dimensional case it was proposed the following multi-
plication map. For each two vectors ~p1,~p2 from the unit ball, pi pi ≤ 1, it is assigned the vector
~p1 ⊛ ~p2 by the rule,

~p1 ⊛ ~p2 =q1−|~p1|2 ~p2 +q1−|~p2|2 ~p1 − ~p1 × ~p2,

(3.8)

where |~p| = p~p·~p is the Euclidean vector norm, ~p1 · ~p2 and ~p1 × ~p2 stand for the dot and the

cross products correspondingly. This multiplication is noncommutative, but as we will see below
is associative. Since,

1−|~p1 ⊛~p2|2 =(cid:18)q(1−|~p1|2)(1−|~p2|2)− ~p1 ·~p2(cid:19)2

≥ 0,

(3.9)

the resulting vector ~p1 ⊛ ~p2 also belongs to the unit ball. The above multiplication also can be
deﬁned in seven dimensions, however in this case it will be non-associative, but alternative.

For the associator of three vectors one ﬁnds

A(~p1,~p2,~p3) = (~p1 ⊛~p2) ⊛ ~p3 − ~p1 ⊛ (~p2 ⊛ ~p3)

= (~p1 ×~p2)× ~p3 − (~p1 ·~p2)~p3 − ~p1 × (~p2 × ~p3) + (~p2 ·~p3)~p1.

(3.10)

Alternative multiplications

Vladislav Kupriyanov

In three dimensions due to the identity, ~p1 × (~p2 × ~p3) = (~p1 · ~p3)~p2 − (~p1 ·~p2)~p3, the above ex-
pression vanishes, which means that the vector star product (3.8) is associative. In seven dimensions
the coordinates of the vector ~p1 × ~p2 can be written as
(~p1 × ~p2)i = e i jk p j
1 pk
2,

(3.11)
where e i jk is deﬁned after the eq. (3.2). Taking into account (3.4) one obtains for the associator
(3.10) written in the components,

A(~p1,~p2,~p3)i = −2e i jlm p j
1 pl

2 pm
3 .

(3.12)

It is totally antisymmetric, meaning that in seven dimensions the vector star product (3.8) is no
longer associative, but alternative.

To generalize the vector star product (3.8) for the whole Euclidean space V we introduce the

~k, ki ∈ R.

sin(cid:16) a
2 |~k|(cid:17)
|~k|
2arcsin|~p|

~k =

The inverse map is given by

~p =

For each two vectors~k1,~k2 ∈ V we set:

B(~k1,~k2) =

a

|~p1 ⊛ ~p2|

~p1 ⊛ ~p2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~pa=~ka sin( a

2 |ka|)/|ka|

From the deﬁnition (3.15) one immediately ﬁnds the following properties:
i) B(~k1,~k2) = −B(−~k2,−~k1);
ii) B(~k,0) = B(0,~k) =~k;
iii) B(~k1,~k2) =~k1 +~k2 − a ~k1 ×~k2 + . . .;
iv) in three dimensions the vector multiplication (3.15) is associative,

B(B(~k1,~k2),~k3) = B(~k1, B(~k2,~k3));

while, in seven dimensions it is not associative, but alternative.

The derivation of the expression for B(~k1,~k2) in three space dimensions and its relation with BCH
formula for SU (2) can be found in [20, 21].

Star product. Let us deﬁne the star product as

f ⋆ g(x) = Z d7k1
(2p )7

d7k2
(2p )7

˜f (k1) ˜g (k2)eiB(~k1,~k2)·~x,

(3.16)

where ˜f stands for the Fourier transform of the function f . Due to the properties of the vector
multiplication B(~k1,~k2), the introduced star product is hermitian,

( f ⋆ g)∗ = g∗ ⋆ f ∗,

(3.17)

satisﬁes the stability of the unity, i.e., f ⋆ 1 = 1 ⋆ f = f (x). It provides the quantization of the
bracket (3.7),

= xie i jk¶ j f ¶ kg.

(3.18)

The property (iv) implies that the star product (3.16) is alternative. Consequently, the star commu-
tator [ f ,g]⋆ satisfy the Malcev identity.

Let us calculate xi ⋆ f using (3.16). Since the Fourier transform of xi is the derivative of a Dirac

delta function, we get

Integration. To introduce the trace functional (integration) on the algebra of the star product

ﬁrst we note that ¶ i(cid:0)e i jkxk(cid:1) = 0, due to the antisymmetry of e i jk. Thus, for functions f and g
vanishing on the inﬁnity and the bracket (3.7) one has, R d7x{ f ,g} = 0. That is, it is reasonable

to take the canonical integration as the corresponding trace functional. However, the star product
(3.16) is not closed,

Z d7x[ f ⋆ g− f · g] 6= 0.

(3.22)

To overcome this difﬁculty one may search for the gauge equivalent, in the sense (1.4), star product
which would be closed with respect to the introduced integration. In [22] we did it for the star
product corresponding to the algebra su(2). The procedure of ﬁnding the gauge operator for the

Vladislav Kupriyanov

star product (3.16) is absolutely analogous to [22], except for some coefﬁcients because of the
different dimensions. Here we give only the ﬁnal result. The star product

f ◦ g = D−1 (D f ⋆ Dg) ,

where

(3.24)

(3.25)

By the construction, (3.23) is alternative. Consequently, for this star product the integrated associ-
ator vanishes.

4. Weyl star product

In this section we discuss the quantization of the arbitrary (non)-Poisson bracket, following

[15]. To start with let us introduce some deﬁnitions.

• The ⋆ is called Weyl star product, if it satisﬁes

(xi1 . . . xin ) ⋆ f = (cid:229)

1
n!

Pn

Pn(xi1 ⋆ (. . . ⋆ (xin ⋆ f ) . . .) .

where Pn denotes a permutation of n elements. E.g., for the product of xix j,

(xix j) ⋆ f =

1

2(cid:0)xi ⋆ (x j ⋆ f ) + x j ⋆ (xi ⋆ f )(cid:1) .

• Weak Hermiticity means that for all x j,

(x j ⋆ f )∗ = f ∗ ⋆ x j.

• The star product is strictly triangular, if the r.h.s. of

xi ⋆ x j − x j ⋆ xi

2ia

= Pi j(x),

does not depend on a .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

Proposition 1. For any bivector ﬁeld Pi j there is unique weakly Hermitian strictly triangular Weyl
star product satisfying the stability of unity condition, f (x) ⋆ 1 = 1 ⋆ f (x) = f (x).

The proof of this statement is constructive, see [15]. We present recursion relations that allow to

Up to this order the star product is hermitian and satisﬁes (2.4) for any three function f ,g and h,
i.e., alternative.

Let us discuss an important property of the introduced star product which holds true in all

orders. For the Weyl star product one has by (4.1)

(xix j) ⋆ xk =

1

2(cid:16)xi ⋆ (x j ⋆ xk) + x j ⋆ (xi ⋆ xk)(cid:17) .

On the other hand the stability of the unity,

implies

Which means that

1

Let us call the star product satisfying (4.12) weakly alternative. We have proved that the weakly
Hermitian Wey star product is weakly alternative.

The same way that the weak Hermiticity (4.3) does not necessarily implies Hermiticity, ( f ⋆
g)∗ = g∗ ⋆ f ∗, the weakly alternative star product should not necessarily be alternative. To make the
Weyl star product hermitian one needs to relax the condition (4.4) and admit the corrections in a
2 + O(cid:0)a 4(cid:1). Our conjecture
(renormalization) of the given bi-vector Pi j(x), Pi j → Pi j
is that hermitian Weyl star product is alternative.
k xk, the weakly hermitian star product is also hermitian and
alternative in all orders. The explicit example of non-associative Weyl star product (3.16) which is
hermitian and alternative was given in the previous section.

In this case, the integrated bracket of two Schwartz functions vanishes, R{ f ,g} = 0, implying that

In open string theory one may choose, m = pdet(g + F ), as a Born-Infeld measure.In this case,
that for the Weyl star product (4.5), already in the second order, O(cid:0)a 2(cid:1), the l.h.s. of (4.14) does

not vanish. To give the precise expression of (4.14) we note that because of the identities,

Z dNxm [ f ◦ g− f · g] = O(cid:0)a 3(cid:1) .

(4.21)

Since, the new star product (4.20) is gauge equivalent to the alternative one (4.5), it is also alterna-
tive. Hence, for this star product holds,

Z ( f ◦ g)◦ h = Z f ◦ (g◦ h),

(4.22)

the integrated associator vanishes.

5. Conclusions

We argue that the violation of the associativity in the formulation of some physical models
should not manifest itself on the physical observables. This in turn can be achieved if to require
that the integrated associator vanishes. We show that alternative closed star products satisfy this
condition and consequently are suitable to work with non-associative algebras appearing in physical
context. Some more arguments in favor of alternative star products can be found in [24, 25].

In general case, discussing the quantization of brackets { f ,g} = Pi j(x)¶ i f ¶ jg, we provide the

procedure of the construction and the explicit expressions in ﬁrst orders of the closed alternative
star products. For the linear bracket corresponding to the algebra of imaginary octonions, we obtain
the explicit formula for the star product in all orders.

Finally we note that there are some different approaches in treating the non-associative systems
within the framework of deformation quantization. For exemple, one may require the associativity
of the star product only for the physical observables [26], or introduce new elements to the original
algebra which will make it associative [27].

The extended version of this contribution to the proceedings to the CORFU2015 containing

more technical details and proofs is in preparation.
