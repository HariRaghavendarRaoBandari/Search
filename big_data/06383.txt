We study critical behaviour of disordered magnets: the system with cubic anisotropy and scalar
disorder and that with random direction of anisotropy axis. The quenched disorder is taken into
account by replica method. We derive to ﬁrst order in ǫ approximation the renormalization group
equations taking into account possible replica symmetry breaking.

INTRODUCTION

Wilson and Fisher calculation of the critical exponents
for the scalar φ4 (and X − Y ) model by analysis of the
renormalization group (RG) equations1 was a ground-
breaking discovery. The perturbation expansions of the
beta functions of the RG equations turned out to be ǫ ex-
pansions, and the rules how to calculate the coeﬃcients
in such expansions were formulated. Immediately after
that O(n) model with cubic anisotropy term was studied
by Aharony2 (see also Refs. 3–5). Later the ǫ expansion
was used to derive the RG equations for the vector φ4
model with quenched scalar disorder6–8 (see also Ref. 9).
and for the model with cubic anisotropy and such dis-
order, also for the model with random direction of the
anisotropy axis10.

The quenched disorder was taken into account in the
mentioned above works by the replica method11. This
method was advanced by Dotsenko et al.12, who have
shown that the replica symmetry, assumed in the previ-
ous application of the method to the RG theory, can be
spontaneously broken. (This kind of replica symmetry
breaking (RSB) was previously discovered by Parisi in
the theory of spin glasses13.)

The aim of the present communication is general-
ization of the well known RG equations for the two
anisotropic models mentioned above:
the model with
cubic anisotropy and that with random direction of the
anisotropy axis for the case of RSB. We also hope that
the way we arrive to such generalization will be of some
methodic interest.

II. RG EQUATIONS FOR THE CASE OF

MULTICOMPONENT ORDER PARAMETER

The scalar φ4 model is described by the Hamiltonian

H[φ] =

1
2

(∇φ)2 + τ φ2 + gφ4 = H0 + V,

(1)

where H0 represents the ﬁrst term of the Hamiltonian
and V the two other terms; the space has dimension d.

Considering V as a perturbation one obtains the RG
equations for the parameters of the model14, with the
beta functions being inﬁnite series in the powers of τ
and g. The problem of calculation of the coeﬃcients in
the RG equations has two parts: calculation of momen-
tum (coordinate) integrals and calculation of combina-
toric multipliers.

The integration part of the problem is exactly the same
for a any Hamiltonian with the multicomponent ﬁeld φA
(calligraphic letter can stand for index of any origin) and
quartic interaction.

H[φ] =

(∇φA)2 + V (φA),

(2)

1

2XA

where V is a polynomial function of φA containing terms
of the second and forth degree. Only combinatoric mul-
tipliers of the perturbation series terms depend upon the
speciﬁc Hamiltonian.

More speciﬁcally, each term in the perturbation series
expansion of the beta functions for the generic Hamilto-
nian is the product of that for the scalar φ4 model, given
by integration demanded by the relevant diagram(s), and
the combinatoric multiplier given by contraction of the
interaction (4) demanded by this same diagram(s).

To express this idea we can decompose the ﬁelds as

φA(r) = φ(r) ˆφA,

(3)

where φ(r) is a ﬂuctuating basic ﬁeld, and ˆφA shows, so
to say, ”direction” of the ﬁeld. To solve the combina-
toric part of the problem we can deal with the symbolic
Hamiltonian containing only ˆφA. For example, for the
vector φ4 model we can use

ˆV =Xa

τ ˆφ2

a + uXab

ˆφ2

ˆφ2
b.

In general case we have to operate with

ˆV =Xi

giΦi,

(4)

(5)

where the eﬀective vertices Φi are problem speciﬁc ho-
mogeneous polynomials of the second or fourth degree of
ˆφA ﬁelds.

To ﬁrst order in ǫ the RG equations are

(7)

where ǫ = 4 − d, and Kd = Sd/(2π)d, Sd is the surface of
the sphere of unit radius in d dimensions. Recalling that
the beta functions are due to box and tadpole diagram
respectively we understand that the RG equations for the
generic Hamiltonian can be presented as

and the coeﬃcients cijk are found from the equation

The scheme of the replica method can be described in
the following steps11. First, the measurable quantities
we are interested in should be calculated for integer p.
Second, the analytic continuation of the obtained func-
tions of the parameter p should be made for an arbitrary
non-integer p. Finally, the limit p → 0 should be taken.

Consider O(n) model (the n-component order param-
eter φi(r) (i = 1, 2 . . . , n)) with added cubic anisotropy
and quenched scalar disorder terms. The system is de-
scribed by the following Hamiltonian5,9,11:

where τ = (T − Tc)/Tc. (It is known that ﬂuctuations of
the other two coeﬃcients in the Landau-Ginsburg func-
tional do not inﬂuence critical behavior for small ǫ.9)

B. RG equations

Thus we can deal with

In the lowest order in ǫ we need only cijk expansion
coeﬃcients. Explicitly performing contractions we obtain

ˆV = τ Φ1 +(cid:2)uΦ − ∆Φ + wΨ(cid:3) ,

where

Φ1 × Φ = 4(2 + pn)Φ1
Φ1 × Φ = 4(2 + n)Φ1
Φ1 × Φc = 12Φ1

Φ × Φ = 8(8 + pn)Φ
Φ × Φ = 8(2 + n)Φ + 48Φ
Φ × Φc = 24Φ + 48Φc
Φ × Φ = 8(8 + n)Φ
Φ × Φc = 24Φ + 48Φc
Φc × Φc = 72Φc.

The connection between the parameters of the Hamilto-

in the case considered.

Φ1 × Ψ = 4(1 + p + n)Φ1
Φ × Ψ = 8(1 + p + n)Φ + 48Ψ

The RG equations coincide with those of Ref. 10 (for

generalization including ǫ2 terms see Refs. 15 and 16).

The analog of Eqs. (31) is

IV. RANDOM DIRECTION OF THE

ANISOTROPY AXIS

The random-axis model

H = −JXij

Jij ~Si ~Sj − D0Xi

(~xi ~Si)2

(32)

was introduced by Harris et al.17 to describe the magnetic
properties of amorphous alloys. In Eq. (32) ~Si is an n-
component spin vector located at the lattice site i, Jij is
the exchange interaction, ˆxi is a unit vector which points
in the local (random) direction of the uniaxial anisotropy
at the site i, and D0 is the anisotropy constant.

The Hamiltonian of the model in the continuum ap-
proximation and after the replica trick can be presented
as10

Eqs. (40) - (43) exactly coincide with those from Ref.10.

V. REPLICA SYMMETRY BREAKING

Consider ﬁrst the case of scalar disorder from Section
III. In this case there is one replica non-diagonal eﬀec-
tive vertex – Φ. Hence possible RSB will be taken into
account if we generalize the Hamiltonian (14) in the fol-
lowing way.

(49)

Substituting these equations (and Eqs. (19)-(27) into Eq.
(8) we obtain the RG equations.

We shall write down these equations assuming that the
matrix ∆αβ has a general Parisi RSB structure, and in
the limit p → 0 is parameterized in terms of its diagonal

in the interval 0 < x < 0 (which can be presented as

elements e∆ and the oﬀ-diagonal function ∆(x) deﬁned
∆ = (e∆, ∆(x)).11.

The standard technique of the Parisi RSB algebra is
diﬀerent from ordinary matrix algebra in deﬁning the
product of matrices13 (and we have such product in the
r.h.s. of Eq. (47)). The deﬁnition of the product of Parisi

dxa(x)b(x)

matrices is as follows. Let a = (ea, a(x)), b = (eb, b(x)),
c = (ec, c(x)), and c = ab. Then
ec =eaeb −Z 1
dyb(y)(cid:19) a(x)
c(x) =(cid:18)ea −Z 1

For the case of random anisotropy axis the situation
is very much similar. In this case there are two replica
non-diagonal eﬀective vertices – Φ and Ψ. Hence the
Hamiltonian which takes into account possible symmetry
breaking should be written in the following form.

VI. DISCUSSION

The main result of this paper is the RG equations tak-
ing into account possible RSB for the model with cu-
bic anisotropy and quenched scalar disorder and for that
with random direction of anisotropy axis (Eqs.
(52) -
(55) and Eqs. (57) - (60) respectively).

The natural question is whether RSB occurs for the
transitions we are studying? We will give hear a very
limited answer to this question,
formulating what is
known up to now. RSB possibility was analysed for the
case of ferromagnetic transition in vector φ4 model with
quenched scalar disorder (no cubic anisotropy term)11,12.
For this model it was shown that among the two non-
trivial ﬁxed points of Eqs. (52), (53) with v = 0,7 the
pure RS ﬁxed point (u, ∆) = (ǫ/4K4(n + 8), (0, 0)) is sta-
ble with respect to RSB perturbations for n > 4, same
as it was shown before to be stable with respect to RS
perturbations. On the other hand, the random RS ﬁxed
point (u, ∆) = (ǫ/16K4(n−1), (ǫ(4−n)/64K4(n−1), 0)),
though being stable with respect to RS perturbations for
n < 4, is unstable for RSB perturbations.
It was also
shown that the one-step RSB random ﬁxed point is, with
certain caveats, stable with respect to all perturbations11
for n < 4. The full answer to the questions posed above
for the anisotropic models can be given only after further
research.

As a simple illustration we present on Fig. 1 phase por-
traits of the system (52),(53) without cubic anisotropy
(v = 0) in RS subspace. We see the stable pure ﬁxed
points for n = 5 and the stable random ﬁxed points for
n = 2. In both cases we see the unstable Gaussian ﬁxed
point.

Appendix D: Operator product expansion

Eq.

(8) appear naturally within the operator prod-
uct expansion (OPE) method, another great discovery of
Wilson18 (see also Refs. 19,20; application of this method
to the theory of classical phase transitions is particularly
clearly presented in the book by Cardy5).

The operator product expansion is a universal concep-
tion of quantum ﬁeld theory. The essential idea is that
for any two local operator quantum ﬁelds at points x, y
(we consider Euclidean space) their product may be ex-
pressed in terms of a series of local quantum ﬁelds at any
other point ( which may be identiﬁed with x or y) times
c-number coeﬃcient functions which depend on |x − y|.
This general statement, in particular case that will be
relevant for us, can be presented as follows5,14. Let Φ
(called scaling ﬁeld) be some product of massless free
ﬁelds. Then

is the propagator of the free ﬁelds.(Further on, not to
clutter notation, we’ll omit the colon signs, where it can
not lead to confusion.)

Let us consider a ﬁxed point Hamiltonian H ∗ which
is perturbed by a number of scaling ﬁelds, so that the
partition function is5

where xi is the appropriate natural scaling dimension,
and microscopic cut-oﬀ ac is implied in the integral. Ex-
panding in the powers of coupling we obtain

where all correlation functions are to be evaluated with
respect to the ﬁxed point Hamiltonian H ∗.

We implement the RG by changing the microscopic
cut-oﬀ from ac to (1+dℓ)ac and asking how the couplings
gi should be changed to preserve the partition function Z.
The answer is given by the perturbative RG equations5
