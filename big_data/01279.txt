Weyl semimetals are new states of matter which feature novel Fermi arcs and exotic transport phe-
nomena. Based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, we report that the chalcopyrites CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2,
AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2 are ideal Weyl semimetals, having largely separated Weyl points (∼ 0.05˚A−1)
and uncovered Fermi arcs that are amenable to experimental detections. We also construct a mini-
mal eﬀective model to capture the low-energy physics of this class of Weyl semimetals. Our discovery
is a major step toward a perfect playground of intriguing Weyl semimetals and potential applications
for low-power and high-speed electronics.

Weyl fermions, originally introduced as massless chi-
ral fermions, are described by the Weyl equation[1].
Even though a number of elementary particles were con-
sidered as candidates of Weyl fermions, conclusive evi-
dences of Weyl fermions as elementary particles are still
lacking. Weyl fermions were also proposed as emer-
gent low-energy quasiparticles in condensed matter sys-
tems breaking either time-reversal or spatial-inversion
symmetry [2–16]. One hallmark of Weyl semimet-
als is the existence of Fermi arcs in surface states[3].
So far the only experimentally known Weyl semimet-
als are the TaAs-class compounds,
in which two sets
of inequivalent Weyl points away from the Fermi level
and complex Fermi surfaces were found by ARPES
experiments[17–19]. Experimental evidences of negative
magnetoresistance[2, 20] induced by the chiral anomaly
were also reported[21–26]. However, deﬁnite signatures
of the chiral anomaly in the quantum limit, such as the
linear-B negative magnetoresistance[2, 20, 27] and the
emergent supersymmetry[28], and others[29–32] haven’t
been experimentally observed in known Weyl semimetals,
which is partly due to the facts that the Weyl points are
not all at the Fermi level and that there are coexisting
trivial Fermi pockets. Therefore, it is urgent to discover
ideal Weyl semimetals with only symmetry-related Weyl
points at the Fermi level.

FIG. 1. Crystal structure and Brillouin zone (BZ). (a) The
crystal structure of chalcopyrite compounds ABC2, includ-
ing CuTlSe2, CuTlTe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2, ZnPbAs2 and
ZnPbSb2. The deviation of C atom (green) away from the
center of tetrahedron formed by A and B atoms is denoted
by δu. (b) The top view of the chalcopyrite structure. The
two-fold rotation symmetries (C2x and C2y) and the two mir-
ror symmetries (Mxy and M−xy) are marked. (c) The BZ of
chalcopyrite compounds.

In this work, we focus on a large family of ternary
chalcopyrites ABC2 at stoichiometry, which were of
great interest because of potential applications including
the thermoelectric eﬀect, non-linear optics and solar
cells[33, 34]. Recently, some ternary chalcopyrites were
predicted to be topological
insulators[35]. Here, our
ﬁrst-principles calculations ﬁnd that the chalcopyrite
compounds CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2
are a class of
ideal Weyl semimetals having eight
symmetry-related Weyl points exactly at the Fermi level,

but without any ﬁne tuning. CuTlTe2 and ZnPbSb2
are also Weyl semimetals having eight symmetry-related
Weyl points in energy gaps but have a few coexisting
trivial bands around the N point; consequently they are
not ideal Weyl semimetals at stoichiometry but can be
tuned to be ideal Weyl semimetals by gating or doping.
The ideal Weyl semimetals predicted in the chalcopyrites
are analogous to those in compressively strained HgTe
and half-Heusler compounds[16], but have one important
advantage: external strain is no longer needed to realize

ideal Weyl semimetal phases in these chalcopyrites.
The surface Fermi arcs of these Weyl semimetals on
both the (001) and (010) surfaces are uncovered and
are amenable to ARPES detections. Such ideal Weyl
semimetals provide a promising arena to observe the
weak-ﬁeld linear-B negative magneto-resistance[2, 36],
a signature of the chiral anomaly in the quantum limit,
which is still in debate so far.

Electronic structures
The chalcopyrite compounds share a body-centered-
tetragonal (bct) crystal structure with the space group
2d (I¯42d) which could be obtained by doubling the
D12
zinc-blende structure along the z direction, such that its
lattice constant c is about twice of a, as shown in Fig.
1a. It has two twofold rotation symmetries C2x and C2y
and two mirror symmetries Mxy and M−xy combining
with a proper glide (Fig. 1b). Generally, in the structure
of chalcopyrites ABC2, two A and two B atoms form
a tetrahedron surrounding one C atom. The tetrahe-
dron is slightly tetragonally distorted, characterized by
the ratio of the lattice constants η = c/2a, and the C
atoms is oﬀ the center of the tetrahedron, characterized
by δu = (R2
BC)/a2 where RAC and RBC denote
the distance between C and its nearest A and B atoms
respectively. Heuristically, the zinc-blende HgTe can be

AC − R2

regarded as a special “chalcopyrite” ABC2 with A=Hg,
B=Hg, C=Te, η = 1, and δu = 0. Interestingly, the chal-
copyrite compounds ABC2, where the cubic symmetry
is broken due to the tetragonal distortion (η (cid:54)= 1) and
the internal displacement (δu (cid:54)= 0), can be eﬀectively
considered as a strained HgTe.

The I-III-VI2 and II-IV-V2 chalcopyrite compounds
have sixteen valence electrons per unit cell, naively
indicating an insulating ground state, which is true
for CuInS2 and ZnGeAs2. However, an sp-type band
inversion[37], like in HgTe, exists in many I-III-VI2 and
II-IV-V2 chalcopyrite compounds, which can give rise to
topologically nontrivial state[35]. Notably, as the chal-
copyrite structure is eﬀectively similar to a strained zinc-
blende structure, those chalcopyrite compounds with the
nontrivial band inversion are expected to realize topo-
logical insulators or ideal Weyl semimetals, depending
on the type of the eﬀective strain[16].
Indeed, our
ﬁrst-principles calculations show that CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2,
AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2 are ideal Weyl semimetals with
eight symmetry-related Weyl points at the Fermi level,
and CuTlTe2 and ZnPbSb2 are also Weyl semimetals
with eight symmetry-related Weyl points but coexisting
with trivial Fermi pockets. Four pairs of Weyl points are
pinned either in the kx = 0 or ky = 0 plane because of
crystal symmetries, schematically shown in Fig. 2d.

ample to show the unique feature of symmetry-protected
Weyl points in topologically nontrivial chalcopyrite
compounds I-III-VI2 and II-IV-V2. The band inversion
between the s bands of Cu and Tl and the p bands of
Te around Γ, which makes the p bands of Te dominate
the Fermi level, is shown in Fig. 2a and b. The bands of
CuTlTe2 are very similar to those of HgTe (equivalently
Hg2Te2), except some features due to the tetragonal
distortion in the chalcopyrite structure (η (cid:54)= 1 and
δu (cid:54)= 0). We can see that the top of valence bands
of Hg2Te2, without SOC, are three-fold degenerate,
indicating the degeneracy of px, py and pz orbitals at the
Γ point, shown in Fig. 2c. Contrastively, in CuTlTe2, the
top of valence bands at Γ split into two-fold degenerate
bands (px,y) and one single band (pz), shown in Fig. 2a,
which indicates an eﬀective tensile uniaxial strain along
the c direction. Therefore, CuTlTe2 is expected to be
an ideal Weyl semimetal,
like the strained HgTe[16].
The Weyl point is really seen in the bands of CuTlTe2
with SOC (Fig. 2b, e). There are totally eight Weyl
points which are all related to each other by symmetries,
schematically shown in Fig. 2d. They are conﬁned in
kx = 0 or ky = 0 planes by the C2T = C2 · T symmetry,
where C2 denotes a two-fold rotation C2x or C2y, and
T denotes the time-reversal symmetry. The four Weyl
points in the kx = 0 (ky = 0) plane have the same
chirality, for example, ‘+1’ (‘−1’) in Fig. 2d and e.

Surface states and Fermi arcs
The existence of topologically protected Fermi arcs is one
hallmark of Weyl semimetals. We calculate the surface
states and Fermi arcs of CuTlTe2 through the maximally
localized Wannier functions on the basis of ﬁrst-principles
calculations. The local density of states (LDOS) on the
(001) surface is shown in Fig. 3a. One touching point ( ¯k∗
x,
0) in the ¯X-¯Γ, projected from the two Weyl points (k∗
x, 0,
z ), has a monopole charge ‘−2’. Similarly, the touch-
±k∗
ing point (− ¯k∗
x, 0) also has a monopole charge ‘−2’, while
both (0,± ¯k∗
y) have a monopole charge ‘+2’. Therefore,
one cannot see open Fermi arcs on the (001) surface Fermi
surface because of the monopole charges of ±2. We calcu-
late the Fermi arcs on the (001) surface, shown in Fig. 3b,
where a closed Fermi surface consisting of four individual
Fermi arcs is presented. Most interestingly, the surface
states have the velocities of opposite sign along ¯Γ- ¯M1 and
¯Γ- ¯M2, shown in Fig. 3a, indicating that the closed Fermi
surface consisting of four Fermi arcs is topological diﬀer-
ent from the surface state of topological insulators such
as Bi2Se3[38], where two Fermi velocities along ¯Γ- ¯M1 and
¯Γ- ¯M2 have the same sign.
On the (010) surface, there are six gapless points,
including four points (± ¯k∗
x, ± ¯k∗
z ) with the monopole
charge ‘−1’, and two points (0,± ¯k∗
z ) with the monopole
charge ‘+2’. The open Fermi arcs emerge, as shown in
Fig. 3c, and the zoomed-in parts of Fermi arcs are shown

and ZnPbAs2 are ideal Weyl semimetals with Weyl points ex-
actly at the Fermi level without other coexisting bulk bands.

isting bulk bands around the N point.

in Fig. 3d. The Fermi arcs are consistent with those in
strained HgTe [16]. However, it is worth noticing that
the Weyl points here are well separated, for example,
about 5% of the reciprocal lattice constant between the
two Weyl points (±k∗
x, 0, k∗
z ), which is much amenable
for experimental detections.

Weyl semimetal candidates
In Fig. 4, based on the modiﬁed Becke-Johnson (mBJ)
calculations, the bulk band structures of six chalcopyrite
compounds CuTlSe2, CuTlTe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2,
ZnPbAs2, and ZnPbSb2, are shown, exhibiting similar
band structures. Based on our calculations, they are all
Weyl semimetals with eight symmetry-protected Weyl
points, especially including four ideal Weyl semimet-
als CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2, and ZnPbAs2. For
CuTlTe2 and ZnPbSb2, the bottom of the conduction
bands stays around the N point at the boundary of the
BZ (see Fig. 1c) which is far from the Γ point. Therefore,
although there are trivial bulk bands coexisting with
the Weyl points, the Weyl points are still well separated
from the trivial bands in CuTlTe2 and ZnPbSb2. For all
these six Weyl semimetals, the positions of Weyl points
(±k∗
z ) are calculated by both
standard GGA and mBJ calculations, listed in Table I
in the supplementary information (SI). We can see that
the larger diﬀerence in atomic radius between A and B
atoms in chalcopyrites ABC2 produces the larger k∗
z for
Weyl points, and the larger SOC of C atom results in
larger k∗
x,y. Consequently, Weyl points of CuTlTe2 and
ZnPbSb2 are the most separated among these materials.

The topological nature in these ideal Weyl semimetals
is determined mainly by the low-energy physics near the
Weyl points, which can be captured by a low-energy eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian. Up to the quadratic order of momenta
k, the low-energy eﬀective model can be explicitly writ-
ten down under the restriction to the time-reversal sym-
metry and the lattice symmetry (D2d), as shown in the
SI. Interestingly, we can reach an analytically-trackable
low-energy eﬀective model which can capture the topo-
logical features of these ideal Weyl semimetals:

y) + a2k2

z, Γi are 4× 4
where 0(k) = a0 + a1(k2
matrices given in the SI, and ci, ai, m, v are con-
stants. The eﬀective model can be understood by lower-
ing the symmetry of Luttinger Hamiltonian. The m2Γ5
and kzΓ35 terms break reﬂection and inversion symme-
tries, respectively, rendering a quadratic band-touching
to split into eight Weyl points in the high-symmetry
plane as stated before. The eigen-energy reads E(k) =
2 , where di(k) are given
in the SI. There are eight Weyl points in this eﬀective
Hamiltonian whose locations are given in the SI for cer-
tain range of parameters. The projected Hamiltonian
near one of the Weyl points is described by the Weyl
equations, i.e.,

0(k) ±(cid:2)d2

where the identity matrix part is neglected because
it does not aﬀect the topological properties.
Since
the low-energy physics is captured by the locations
and the Fermi velocities of the Weyl points which can
be determined uniquely by the the eﬀective model, it
correctly captures the low-energy physics in this class of
Weyl semimetals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Appendix A: The methods of the ﬁrst-principles calculations

The ab-initio calculations are carried out in the framework of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-type generalized gradient
approximation of the density functional theory through employing the BSTATE package[39] with the plane-wave
pseudo-potential method. The kinetic energy cutoﬀ is ﬁxed to 340eV, and the k-point mesh is taken as 16×16×16
for the bulk calculations. The spin-orbit coupling eﬀect is self-consistently included. The modiﬁed Becke-Johnson
(mBJ) calculations [40] are used to correct the underestimated band gaps. All the calculations are further conﬁrmed
by the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP).[41] The lattice constants and atoms are fully relaxed with the
total energy cutoﬀ of 1.E − 7 eV. Maximally localized Wannier functions[42, 43] are employed to obtain the ab initio
tight-binding model of semi-inﬁnite systems with the (001) or (010) surface as the boundary[44] to exhibit topological
surface states and Fermi arcs. An iterative method [45, 46] is used to obtain the surface Green’s function of the
semi-inﬁnite system.

Appendix B: The Weyl points in CuTlSe2, CuTlTe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2, ZnPbAs2 and ZnPbSb2

Based on both GGA and mBJ calculations, chalcopyrite compounds CuTlSe2, CuTlTe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2,
ZnPbAs2 and ZnPbSb2 are found to be Weyl semimetal candidates with four pairs of Weyl points in the BZ, including
four ideal Weyl semimetal candidates (CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2). GGA calculations underestimate
the band gap, which means the band inversion is overestimated, but the mBJ calculations could much correct the
band energy, so the conclusion of the ideal Weyl semimetals, in Table S1, is based on mBJ calculations. For the
others, such as, the locations of Weyl points and the separation between Weyl points, we give all results from both
GGA and mBJ to compare.

Appendix C: The eﬀective Hamiltonian

The low-energy physics in the chalcopyrite is dominated by p-state electrons of Te atoms. In the presence of spin
orbit coupling, those states with the total angular momentum J = 3/2 contribute the most degrees of freedom near
the Fermi energy. Thus we construct the eﬀective Hamiltonian from J = 3/2 multiplets. As stated in the main text,
the eﬀective model near the Γ point is dictated by the lattice symmetry (D2d ), and the time reversal symmetry. All
4×4 Hermitian matrices can be represented by sixteen Γ matrices [47], forming ﬁve irreducible representations of D2d

For a reference, we ﬁt these constants to the results of ﬁrst-principle calculations of CuTlTe2 with the normal GGA ,
and the summary is listed in Table S2. The bands from this eﬀective model are calculated and compared with those
from ﬁrst-principles calculations in Fig. S1. If we keep the linear term of vkzΓ35 and neglect the other linear terms in

where the identity part is neglected since it does not aﬀect the topological properties. Clearly, above Hamiltonian
describes a Weyl fermions with the chirality given by χ = sign(−vc2c3). In the ideal Weyl semimetal phase, the low
energy physics is determined by the locations and the Fermi velocities of Weyl points. Therefore, the eﬀective model
in Eq. S10 can capture the topological properties of this class of ideal Weyl semimetals.
