Gravitational Eﬀects on Measurements of the Muon Dipole Moments

Physics Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA

(Dated: March 2, 2016)

Andrew Kobach

If the technology for muon storage rings one day permits sensitivity to precession at the
order of 10−8 Hz, the local gravitational ﬁeld of Earth can be a dominant contribution to
the precession of the muon, which, if ignored, can fake the signal for a nonzero muon electric
dipole moment (EDM). Speciﬁcally, the eﬀects of Earth’s gravity on the motion of a muon’s
spin is indistinguishable from it having a nonzero EDM of magnitude dµ ∼ 10−29 e cm in
a storage ring with vertical magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1 T, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the
expected upper limit in the Standard Model, dµ (cid:46) 10−36 e cm. As a corollary, measurements
of Earth’s local gravitational ﬁeld using stored muons would be a unique test of special and
general relativity with a bonaﬁde quantum mechanical entity, i.e., an elementary particle’s
spin.

I.

INTRODUCTION

While colliders are suitable for producing heavy particles, uncovering precise detail of the underlying
theory is left to precision measurements performed by dedicated experiments. This is particularly true for
the electromagnetic interaction. For example, the interaction between a charged lepton (cid:96) and an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld is

(cid:10)(cid:96)(p + q)(cid:12)(cid:12)J α

(cid:20)
EM(q2)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:96)(p)(cid:11) ∝ u(p + q)

γαF1(q2) +

2m(cid:96)

(cid:21)

F2(q2) − σαβqβγ5F3(q2)

u(p),

(1)

2 [γα, γβ]. When q2 = 0, F1(0) ≡ 1, and the other
where m(cid:96) is the mass of the lepton and σαβ ≡ i
form factors have values F2(0) = a(cid:96), F3(0) = d(cid:96)/e, where a(cid:96) is the anomalous magnetic dipole moment,
and d(cid:96) is the electric dipole moment (EDM).1 The deﬁnition of F1(q2 = 0) is a requirement that the
theory behaves like classical electrodynamics at low energies, and the values of F2 and F3 are purely
quantum mechanical in origin and can be calculated in perturbation theory. Colliders can measure the
gross scattering probability between charged particles, but they are generally insensitive to these higher-
order eﬀects. Dedicated experiments to measure the dynamics of a charged lepton’s spin in external
electromagnetic ﬁelds, on the other hand, can be singular opportunities to discover deviations from the
Standard Model (SM), since theoretical calculations of charged-lepton dipole moments include all physics
in the SM and, in principle, beyond.

Measurements of aµ, de, and dµ serve as the best opportunities to discover new physics. On the other
hand, while the electron is the easiest particle to control, experimentally, the potential to discover new
physics with ae is minimized, because the value of ae is dominated by QED, and not the SM at the
weak scale, due to the lightness of the electron mass [2]. Taus can be produced in appreciable amounts
at collier experiments, but because of its short lifetime, neither aτ nor dτ have yet been measured with
meaningful precision [3–5].
The muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment aµ was best measured to ∼ 0.5 ppm by the (g − 2)µ
experiment at BNL [6], but resulted in about a 2.7σ - 3.6σ discrepancy with the value expected in the
SM, depending on the details of the contributions of the strong interactions [7–12]. Whether or not this is
a sign of new physics may be settled as improved experimental [13, 14] and theoretical techniques [15–23]
are employed.

1 There can be additional terms in Eq. (1) due to toroidal moments, but their values are, in general, gauge dependent for

elementary fermions [1], and will not be considered in this analysis.

2

The SM predictions for the values of de and dµ are minuscule, due to small magnitude of CP-invariance
violation in the SM and the small values of neutrino masses. The CP-invariance violation from mixing
in the quark sector is the dominant contribution to charged-lepton EDMs,2 where a nonzero muon EDM
ﬁrst occurs at the four loops, resulting in the upper limits de (cid:46) 10−38 e cm and dµ (cid:46) 10−36 e cm [24–26].
New physics, then, can easily play a dominant role over the SM in the contribution to the charged-lepton
EDMs. The current limits on the electron and muon EDMs are de < 1.6 × 10−27 e cm (90% CL) and
dµ < 1.05 × 10−19 e cm (95% CL) [27, 28]. While this strong limit on de can imply a stronger limit
on the value of dµ than what is currently experimentally veriﬁed, the naive linear scaling in the SM
de/dµ ∼ me/mµ can be violated in the presence of new physics [29, 30]. New experimental techniques
with stored muons [31] oﬀers opportunities for experiments to improve the limit on dµ by almost 5
orders of magnitude, i.e., down to dµ (cid:46) 10−24 e cm, by choosing the electromagnetic ﬁelds such that the
precession due to aµ is minimized [32, 33]. While further technological advances would be required to
strengthen this limit further, such improvements would be invaluable to ruling out or discovering new
physics that violates CP-invariance.

A measurement of a nonzero muon EDM is often thought to be clear signal of new physics. However,
this might not always be the true. There is a unique relativistic eﬀect for particles in a cyclotron: the
local gravitational ﬁeld will cause the muon’s spin to precess in a way that mimics the dynamics due to a
bonaﬁde dipole moment. For a typical cyclotron with a vertical magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1 T, Earth’s gravity
will induce the same dynamics as a nonzero muon EDM of magnitude dµ ∼ 10−29 e cm, which is about
5 orders of magnitude greater than the upper limit on the SM expectation.

II. GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS ON A STORED MUON

The following is the calculation of the equation of motion for a muon’s spin in constant external
electromagnetic and weak gravitational ﬁelds. The Hamiltonian for a muon with charge q an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld contains the following dipole terms:

Hdipole = −s ·

B(cid:48) +

2mµc

2mµ

where (g − 2)/2 ≡ aµ, and dµ ≡ s(ηq/mc). Here, the primes indicate that these are the ﬁelds perceived
by the particle in its rest frame. The equation of motion in the rest frame of the particle is

These electromagnetic ﬁelds are however not the ﬁelds in the (unprimed) lab frame:

2 Even if other sources of CP-invariance violation are present due from the mixing in the leptonic sector, their contribution

to dµ is very small [24–26].

The equation of motion a particle’s spin in the lab frame can be derived by considering the eﬀect of
well-known Thomas precession of angular momentum:

where t is the time in the lab frame, i.e., τ = γt, and ωT is the Thomas precession frequency:

Here, a is the acceleration of the particle. To calculate the acceleration, one can note that the total

and also that the force on the particle in the lab frame is due to the gravitational and electromagnetic
ﬁelds:

Noting that a ≡ dv/dt and β ≡ v/c, the acceleration is:

Eq. (11) is the well-known precession frequency for the muon’s spin in a constant external electromagnetic
ﬁelds, plus an extra term due to the eﬀects of Earth’s gravity. Interestingly, the precession due to gravity
does not depend on the particle’s mass nor the external electromagnetic ﬁelds, rather only the muon’s
velocity. This is an indication that the eﬀect is purely relativistic, due to the nontrivial dynamics of
angular momentum in accelerating reference frames.

If the particle is stored in a cyclotron lined with detectors, then one can take the diﬀerence between

the spin frequency ωs and the cyclotron frequency [34]

Most cyclotron rings are constructed in a plane, where B is vertical,3 E is radial, and β is azimuthal.
Therefore, since g is also vertical, the gravitational term in Eq. (13) can mimic the motion caused by a
non-zero EDM. When β ≈ 1 and q = e (e being the fundamental electric charge), the magnitude of the
EDM that contributes the same amount as gravity to the precession of the particle is

η ∼ 2mµ|g|

=⇒ dµ ∼ (7 × 10−30 e cm)

Note that the two EDM terms in Eq. (13) that depend on E are negligible compared to the one that
depends on B.

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

With the strong possibility to discover or rule out new physics beyond the SM, signiﬁcant motivation
exists to execute the most precise measurements possible of the values of charged-lepton dipole moments.
Such precision, however, comes at the price of understanding in minute detail the expected behavior of
the experiment on a whole. One such eﬀect is the role of gravity in these experiments. In particular,
gravity will produce a non-trivial eﬀect in relativistic systems with rotating references frames. This
eﬀect can manifest itself in muon storage rings, where the local gravitational ﬁeld alone can cause the
muon’s spin to precess. As calculated in Sec. II, the eﬀect of Earth’s gravity on the precession of a muon
(corresponding to a precession rate of ∼ 10−8 Hz) will fake the signal for a nonzero EDM of dµ ∼ 10−29
e cm in a storage ring with a vertical magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude |B| ∼ 1 T. This gravitational eﬀect
fakes an muon EDM that is much larger than the SM upper limit dµ (cid:46) 10−36 e cm.

The storage ring technology needed to gain this level of precision would require signiﬁcant technological
advances beyond the current state-of-the-art experiments. But if such ability is one day obtained, there
are at least two interesting issues to be addressed. First, if one wishes to gain experimental precision of
the precession rate of a relativistic muon in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld beyond ∼ 10−8 Hz, then
very precise information would be needed regarding the local gravitational eﬀects at the storage ring.
This includes additional assumptions regarding how muons, being solitary second-generation fundamental
particles, interact with gravity. Second, if no new physics is assumed to contribute to the value of dµ,
then it would be a singular opportunity for gravity to be measured by a fundamental particle’s spin,
testing the predictions of special and general relativity with a bonaﬁde quantum mechanical entity.

3 Cyclotrons are constructed such that the magnetic ﬁeld along the ring is parallel to Earth’s gravitational force, e.g., see

Ref. [13].
