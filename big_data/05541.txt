A 15-vertex triangulation of the quaternionic projective plane

Denis Gorodkov

Abstract

In 1992, Brehm and K¨uhnel constructed a 8-dimensional simplicial complex M 8

15 with 15 vertices as a
candidate to be a minimal triangulation of the quaternionic projective plane. They managed to prove that
it is a manifold “like a projective plane” in the sense of Eells and Kuiper. However, it was not known until
now if this complex is PL homeomorphic (or at least homeomorphic) to HP 2. This problem was reduced to
the computation of the ﬁrst rational Pontryagin class of this combinatorial manifold. Realizing an algorithm
due to Gaifullin, we compute the ﬁrst Pontryagin class of M 8
15. As a result, we obtain that it is indeed a
minimal triangulation of HP 2.

Introduction

A triangulation of a PL–manifold is a simplicial complex which is PL homeomorphic to this manifold. A tri-
angulation of a manifold is called (vertex-)minimal if there are no triangulations of the same manifold with
less vertices. The problem of ﬁnding minimal triangulations of a manifold is a classic problem in combinatorial
topology; one can ﬁnd a compilation of the most signiﬁcant results on minimal triangulations in the survey by
F. Lutz [18]. The most interesting examples appear when the minimal triangulation has additional properties
such as a non–trivial symmetry group. One of the well–known examples is the minimal triangulation of RP 2
with 6 vertices. It can be obtained by taking the quotient of the boundary of the icosahedron by the antipodal
involution.
9 with 9 vertices and
proved that this complex is the minimal triangulation of the complex projective plane CP 2. Besides, the sym-
metry group of this complex has order 54. Using similar ideas Brehm and K¨uhnel [3] constructed a 15-vertex
simplicial complex M 8
15) and
conjectured that these complexes are minimal triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane HP 2 where
the PL structure on HP 2 is induced by the canonical smooth structure.

In 1983 K¨uhnel and Banchoﬀ constructed a simplicial complex named CP 2

15 that are PL homeomorphic to M 8

15 and ffM 8

Brehm and K¨uhnel made an attempt to prove that the simplicial complex M 8

15 is PL homeomorphic to HP 2,
but they managed only to prove a weaker statement: M 8
15 is a manifold “like a projective plane”, ie a manifold
that admits a Morse function with exactly 3 critical points. Eells and Kuiper [6] examined this case in detail.
In particular they showed that in dimension 8 such manifolds are distinguished by their Pontryagin numbers.
15 coincide with Pontryagin numbers of HP 2, this
Thus if we prove that Pontryagin numbers of the manifold M 8
will imply that these manifolds are PL homeomorphic, i.e. M 8
15 is a triangulation of HP 2. Moreover, Eells
and Kuiper proved that for any 8-manifold “like a projective plane” its cohomology ring is isomorphic to the
cohomology ring of HP 2, i.e. H ∗(M 8
15, Z) = Z[u]/(u3), deg u = 4. Hence, as an implication of Hirzebruch’s
formula for the signature of an 8–manifold, it is suﬃcient to compute the ﬁrst rational Pontryagin class of M 8
15
to compute its Pontryagin numbers.

As of the time Eells and Kuiper published their paper, there was no approach for computing the ﬁrst
Pontryagin class of a triangulated manifold that would be appropriate for explicit computations. Formulae that
were known by that time ([9, 11, 10, 19, 5, 16]) were not fully combinatorial, i.e. they did not give the posibility
to compute the ﬁrst Pontryagin class using only the combinatorial structure of the triangulation. Moreover, all
these formulae require diﬃcult and laborious computations. The only example of an explicit computation using

In 2004 Gaifullin [12] (cf.

one of these formulae – the Gabrielov–Gelfand–Losik formula [9, 10, 11] – is the computation by Milin [20] of
the ﬁrst Pontryagin class of CP 2
9 .
[13, 14]) constructed an explicit algorithm for computing the ﬁrst rational Pon-
tryagin class of a combinatorial manifold. A combinatorial manifold of dimension n is a simplicial complex K,
such that the link of any vertex of K is PL homeomotphic to the boundary of the n–dimensional simplex. Note
that any PL triangulation of a PL manifold is a combinatorial manifold. This algorithm is fully combinatorial,
i.e. the computation does not need any additional data except the combinatorial structure of the triangulation.

2 Main results

Theorem 1. The ﬁrst rational Pontryagin class p1(M 8
generators of the group H 4(M 8

15, Z) ∼= Z under the natural embedding H 4(M 8

15) is equal to 2u where u is the image of one of the two

15, Z) ⊂ H 4(M 8

15, Q).

Remark 2.1. The results of Kervaire and Milnor [17] imply that the groups of smooth structures on spheres
modulo h-cobordism are trivial up to dimension 6. An easy consequence from this fact is the following: unlike
higher Pontryagin classes, the ﬁrst integral Pontryagin class is a PL invariant and is well-deﬁned for PL manifolds
(cf. [4]). Thus, our theorem can be reformulated in the following way: the ﬁrst integral Pontryagin class p1(M 8
15)
is equal to 2u where u is one of two generators of the group H 4(M 8

15, Z).

Corollary 1. Pontryagin numbers of the combinatorial manifold M 8
numbers of the quaternionic projective plane HP 2.

15 are equal to corresponding Pontryagin

Proof. It follows from the classical Hirzebruch formula that the signature of a closed oriented manifold can be
obtained as a linear combination of Pontryagin numbers of the manifold. For an 8-manifold it looks as follows:

σ(X) =

7p2[X] − p2

1[X]

45

As the cohomology rings of HP 2 and M 8
σ(M 8

15) = σ(HP 2) = 1. It is well-known that p2

1[HP 2] = 4. Thus,

15 are isomorphic, we can choose the orientation on M 8

15 such that

p2
1[M 8

15] = h(2u) ⌣ (2u), [M 8

15]i = 4 = p2

1[HP 2]

Finally, p2[M 8

15] = p2[HP 2] = 7.

It follows from Corollary 1 and from the results of [3, 2, 6] that

Corollary 2. M 8

15 are PL–homeomorphic to HP 2 and are minimal triangulations of HP 2.

15, fM 8

15 and ffM 8

This corollary will be accurately proved in the end of Section 6.
The algorithm for computing the ﬁrst Pontryagin class was implemented on a computer in the general case

using the programming language GAP([15]).

3 Manifolds “like a projective plane”

The classical notion of a Morse function can be generalized for topological or combinatorial manifolds in the
following way. (The author took this generalization from the article [6]. As of today, another non-equivalent
deﬁnition of a Morse function on a combinatorial manifold is used. See [8] for the modern combinatorial Morse
theory.)

Consider one of the ﬁrst assertions of classical Morse theory:

Proposition 1. Let M n be a smooth manifold.
If a ∈ M is a non-critical point of a Morse function
f : M −→ R. Then there is a smooth a–centered coordinate system {xi} such that xn = f (x) − f (a) in a

2

neighbourhood of the point a. If a is a critical point of f , then there is a smooth a–centered coordinate system
{xi} such that

in a neighbourhood of the point a.

(xi)2 +

−

kXi=1

nXi=k+1

(xi)2 = f (x) − f (a)

This crucial statement can be taken as a deﬁnition of a Morse function in the smooth case. In the topological

and combinatorial case one can use this approach, as we can give up the requirement of smoothness.

In the case of a combinatorial manifold K the function f is meant as a function on the geometrical realization

|K| of the manifold.

Definition 3.1. A Morse function on a topological(respectively, combinatorial) manifold X is a continuous
(respectively, piecewise linear) function f : X −→ R, such that in the neighbourhood of any point a ∈ X there
is a continuous a–centered coordinate system {xi}, such that one of the two conditions (1) and (2) is satisﬁed
(respectively, (1) and (2’)):

1. f (x) − f (a) = xn ; such a point a is called ordinary.

i=k+1(xi)2 ; such a point a is called critical of index k in the topologial

2. f (x) − f (a) = −Pk

case.

i=1(xi)2 +Pn

2’. f (x) − f (a) = − max{|x1|, . . . , |xk|} + max{|xk+1|, . . . , |xn|} ; such a point a is called critical of index k

in the combinatorial case.

Remark 3.1. To compare, consider the modern deﬁnition of a combinatorial Morse function from [8]. Let K
be a simplicial complex, S be the set of all simplexes of K and Sd be the set of simplexes of dimension d. A
discrete Morse function on K is a function on S, such that for each σ ∈ Sd

#{τ ∈ Sd+1|τ ) σ and f (τ ) 6 f (σ)} 6 1

#{ν ∈ Sd−1|ν ) σ and f (ν) > f (σ)} 6 1

Most of classical results for Morse theory stay true in the combinatorial case. This deﬁnition is more universal
and more practical than the one we use. In the case of Eells–Kuiper’s deﬁnition most of the results follow from
constructing special deformations, and in the modern deﬁnition most results are ﬁrst of all combinatorial. In
our present work we will use only the deﬁnition from Eells and Kuiper’s article 3.1.

Studying manifolds that allow Morse functions with few critical points is a natural problem. It is well-known
that if there is a Morse function on a manifold with exactly two critical points, then the manifold is necessarily
homeomorphic to a sphere. Eells and Kuiper showed that in the case of three critical points the results are
quite more complicated.

Theorem 2 (Eells, Kuiper [6]). Given a manifold X with a Morse function f : X −→ R with precisely 3 critical
points.

1. Dimension and cohomology. The only possible dimensions of X are n = 0, 2, 4, 8, 16. For n = 0 the
space X consists of three points. For n = 2 the space is homeomorphic to the real projective plane RP 2 .
The cohomology ring H ∗(X, Z) is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the complex (n = 4), quater-
nionic (n = 8) or Cayley (n = 16) projective plane, ie H ∗(X, Z) = Z[u]/(u3) where dim u = n/2.

2. X is a compactiﬁcation of Rn by a sphere Sn/2 .

3. Homotopy type.

For n = 4 only one homotopy type of X CP 2 is possible, for n = 8 there are 6 homotopy types, and for
n = 16 there are 60 of them.

3

4. From the combinatorial point of view, there are inﬁnitely many diﬀerent possible manifolds “like a pro-
jective plane” in dimensions n = 8 and n = 16. They are classiﬁed by their Pontryagin numbers, ie if
two such manifolds have equal Pontryagin numbers, then these manifolds are PL homeomorphic. Some
of these manifolds do not admit a compatible smooth structure.

5. In the case of dimension n = 8 let us present the results more precisely. The Pontryagin number p2

1 of the

manifold X 8 can take the following form

p2
1[X] = 4(2h − 1)2,

where h is an integer parameter, that parameterizes all the X 8. Combinatorial manifolds X 8
compatible smooth structure if and only if h ≡ 4j or h ≡ 4j + 1 modulo 12. Moreover, X 8
belong to the same homotopy class if and only if either h0 − h1 ≡ 0, either h0 + h1 ≡ 1 modulo 12.

h admit a
h0 and X 8
h1

This theorem makes the following deﬁnition natural.

Definition 3.2. A manifold “like a projective plane” is a topological, smooth or combinatorial manifold, such
that there exists, respectively, a continuous, smooth or piecewise linear Morse function with three critical points.

4 Brehm–K¨uhnel complexes

K¨uhnel and Banchoﬀ [3] constructed a special 9-vertex simplicial complex CP 2

properties:

It has several remarkable

1. Among all combinatorial 4-manifolds which are not homeomorphic to the sphere it has the least number

of vertices.

2. Any 3 vertices of CP 2

9 span a simplex contained in the complex (this property is called 3-neighbourliness).

Moreover, 5 vertices of CP 2

9 span a simplex iﬀ the remaining 4 vertices do not span a simplex.

3. This complex is a vertex-minimal triangulation of CP 2.

4. CP 2

Moreover, 9 vertices span a simplex iﬀ the remaining 6 vertices do not span a 5-simplex.

3. The automorphism groups of M 8

15 are isomorphic to A5, A4 and S3 respectively.

The construction of the complexes is based on explicit descriptions of some group actions on the set of

vertices. The actions will be given as subgroups of the permutation group on 15 elements S15.

M = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14}

To deﬁne the remaining 75 8-simplices for each of the complexes, consider the simplexes

L(1) = {3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
N(1) = {3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15}

and take their images under powers of the permutation P .

L(n) = P n−1L(1), N(n) := P n−1N(1)

Finally, denote Ln = L(n) ∪ N(n) and eLn =eL(n) ∪ eN(n).

K1 = L1 ∪ L2 ∪ L3 ∪ L4 ∪ L5;

eL(n) = P n−1T L(1),

eN(n) := P n−1T N(1)

eK1 = eL1 ∪ L2 ∪ L3 ∪ L4 ∪ L5;
eeK1 = eL1 ∪ L2 ∪ eL3 ∪ L4 ∪ L5.

Then the required complexes can be written as

M 8

15 = K0 ∪ K1; fM 8

15 = K0 ∪ eK1; ffM 8

15 = K0 ∪eeK1.

These three complexes are combinatorial manifolds and are PL homeomorphic to each other.
The dimensions n = 2, 4, 8, 16 also appear precisely in the work [2]. The authors consider all combinatorial

manifolds and study the constraints that the number of vertices of a manifold apply on its dimension.

Theorem 3 (Brehm, K¨uhnel [2]). Let M d be a combinatorial manifold with n vertices. Then if n < (cid:24) 3d

then M is PL homeomorphic to a sphere, and if n =

15 is not homeomorphic to the sphere as its cohomology ring is not isomorphic to the

15 is a manifold “like a projective plane”.

In their article Brehm and K¨uhnel conjecture the following:

Conjecture 1 ([3]). M 8

Our main goal is to prove this conjecture.
It follows from Theorems 3 and 2, that

Let us now describe the algorithm of computing the ﬁrst Pontryagin class p1(M 8

15).

5 Gaifullin’s algorithm of computing the ﬁrst Pontryagin class

The results of this section come from Gaifullin’s article [12].

Denote by Tn the abelian group, generated by all isomorphism classes of oriented combinatorial (n − 1)-
spheres (ie hL1i = hL2i if L1 ∼= L2, hLi is the notation for the equivalence class of the sphere L) with relations
h−Li = − hLi where −L is the notation for the sphere L with reversed orientation.

Let f ∈ Hom (Tn, Q), and let K m be an oriented combinatorial manifold. Then denote

f♯(K) = Xσ∈K ,dim σ=m−n

f (hlink σi)σ.

Definition 5.1. A function f : Tn −→ Q is a local formula for a homogeneous polynomial F ∈ Q[p1, p2, . . .] if
for every K the chain f♯(K) is a cycle, such that its homology class is dual to the class F (p1(K), p2(K), . . .).

That is, the coeﬃcient of a simplex σ depends only on the combinatorial type of its “neighbourhood” – the

link.

Our aim is the formula for the ﬁrst Pontryagin class f : T4 −→ Q.

5.1 Bistellar moves

Let K be a combinatorial manifold.

Definition 5.2. Let τ be a simplex, such that τ /∈ K, but all its faces lie in K (we will call such a simplex
empty). Let also sigma ∈ K be a simplex, such that σ ∗ ∂τ is a complex of full dimension in K. Then a ﬂip(also
called a bistellar move or a Pachner move) is a transformation of K that replaces the subcomplex σ ∗ ∂τ by
τ ∗ ∂σ. We will also denote β = βK,σ and call β the bistellar move, associated with σ.

6

Figure 1: Moves in dimension 2

The bistellar moves in dimension 2 are shown on Fig.1.

Theorem 4 (Pachner, [21]). Let K1 and K2 be PL homeomorphic combinatorial manifolds. Then the manifold
K1 can be transformed in the manifold K2 by a ﬁnite composition of bistellar moves and isomorphisms.

Thus, any two combinatorial spheres of the same dimension are connected by a sequence of bistellar moves.
Then it is suﬃcient to show, how does the value f (hLi) change(where L is a combinatorial 3-sphere) under
bistellar moves.

Let βK1,σ : K1 −→ K2 and βK ′

isomorphisms f : K1 −→ K ′
inverse, we will call it inessential, otherwise we will call the move essential.

2, such that f (σ) = τ . If a bistellar move is equivalent to its

5.2 The graph Γ2

Let us deﬁne a new construction – the graph Γn. The vertices of this graph are oriented combinatorial spheres
of dimension n. Two vertices L1 and L2 are connected with an edge if there is an essential bistellar move
β : L1 −→ L2. If there are several non-equivalent bistellar moves between two vertices L1 and L2, then there
are as many edges connecting L1 and L2 as equivalence classes of bistellar moves β : L1 −→ L2.

Now consider, how should the value of the ﬁrst Pontryagin class formula change is we transform a combina-
torial sphere using a bistellar move. Let β : L1 −→ L2 be a bistellar move, where L1 and L2 are combinatorial
3-spheres.

Let v be a vertex of L1. Then we can consider the transformation induced by β on the 2-sphere link L1v.
It is easy to show that this transformation is a bistellar move between 2-spheres link L1v −→ link L2v. Denote
such a move by βv.

Gaifullin [12] constructed a special cohomology class c ∈ H 1(Γ2, Q) and proved the following theorem(for

the explicit construction of the class c see the table lower):

Theorem 5 (Gaifullin, [12]). If f : T4 −→ Q is a local formula for the ﬁrst Pontryagin class, then for each
bistellar move β : L1 −→ L2 the following relation holds true:

f (L2) − f (L1) =Xv

h(βv) ,

where h ∈ C1(Γ2, Q) is a cocycle of the graph Γ2, representing the cohomology class c. For each cocycle h ∈
C1(Γ2; Q), representing the cohomology class c, it is possible to explicitly indicate the function f ∈ Hom (T4, Q),
which is a local formula for the class p1.

To describe explicitly any local formula one should choose a precise representative h of the cohomology class
c. In [12] it is done in the following way. Let us choose for each vertex L of the graph Γ2 a chain ξ, such that
∂ξ{L} = {L} − {∂∆3}. Consider all bistellar moves β1, β2, . . . βr that lower the complexity (deﬁnition in the
beginning of Section 5.3) of the combinatorial sphere L, where for each i βi : L −→ Li. Then assume

The desired cocycle is written by the formula

ξ{L} =

(ξ{Lj } − {βj}).

rXi=1

h({β}) = hc, {β} + {ξL1} − {ξL1}i .

Remark that this choice of the cocycle keeps the formula local, as it depends only on the combiantorial type of
L. To describe explicitly the value of the cohomology class c on a cycle in the graph Γ2 we have to choose a set
of linear generators among all cycles in Γ2.

7

So, a cycle in Γ2 is given, ie a closed sequence of bistellar moves. We will call elementary cycles of the ﬁrst
and second type some special cycles in the graph Γ2. Cycles of the ﬁrst and second type are shown in Fig.2 and
Fig.3 respectively.

The values of the cohomology class c on elementary cycles were constructed in [12], they depend on the
number of triangles neighbouring the vertices whose link change after the bistellar moves. Numbers p, q, r, k,
l on Figures 2 and 3 denote the number of triangles inside the selected angles that contain the corresponding
vertex.

Theorem 5 provides the following algorithm for computig the ﬁrst Pontryagin class.
Consider a simplicial complex K. Choose its orientation.
The algorithm of computing the ﬁrst rational Pontryagin class consists of the following steps:

1. For each (n − 4)-simplex of the complex K, ﬁnd a sequence of bistellar moves that transform the link of

this (n − 4)-simplex into the boundary of a simplex.

2. For each vertex v of the link of each (n−4)-simplex consider link link σ(v). Then all obtained complexes are

combinatorial 2-spheres. Induce the sequences of ﬂips on these complexes as on subcomplexes of link σ.

3. For each obtained chain of ﬂips, that reduce the combinatorial 2-sphere to the boundary of the 3-simplex,
close the chain into a cycle into the complex Γ2 in any way that depends only on the combinatorial type
of the initial sphere.

4. The resulting cycles are cycles in the graph Γ2. Decompose this cycles in linear combinations of elementary

cycles.

5. Count the investment of each elementary cycle, recieve for each σ the number f (hlink σi) and construct

the cycle

f♯(K) = Xσ∈K,dim σ=n−4

f (hlink σi) σ,

representing the homology element that is dual to the ﬁrst Pontryagin class.

The only remaining unexplained step is the decomposition of cycles in the graph Γ2 into linear combinations

of elementary cycles.

In the present article we

We will often use the following notation. Suppose that σ1 and σ2 are simplexes in L, such that ﬂips,
associated with them are deﬁned, and there is no simplex in L, containing both σ1 and σ2. Then denote by
γ(L, σ1, σ2) the following cycle:

L

xβ−1

βσ1−−−−→ L1

We will say that the simplex participates in the bistellar move, if the link of this simplex changes under the

induced transformation.

Definition 5.3. The degree of a vertex v of a simplicial complex K is the number of edges adjacent to this
vertex.

Let us introduce the notion of complexity of a vertex of the graph Γ2 as a combinatorial 2-sphere L with k

vertices.

if L contains at least one vertex of degree 3;
if L contains a vertex of degree 4, but does not contain vertices of degree 3;
if L does not contain vertices of degree 3 and 4.

Now deﬁne the complexity for edges of the graph Γ2 (ie bistellar moves) β : L1 → L2.

a(L) =

a(β) =(max(a(L1), a(L2)),

cycles, then by induction we will be able to represent all the cycle as a linear combination of elementary cycles.
The base of the induction is the empty cycle for complexity of the bistellar moves that is equal to 4 1

On each step we will consider the least possible a for a cycle.
Let a = k + b

6 . Then it is suﬃcient to prove the induction step for each of b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Consider
separately the cases of even and odd b. Each of the cases is illustrated on the right by a corresponding image.
Bistellar moves drawn on the picture are from the initial cycle and from the cycle with a smaller complexity
as well as some auxiliary moves, in some cases the elementary cycles used are also denoted and shown on the
picture.

The case of odd b .

If b is odd the transformations with the biggest complexity in the cycle

β : L1 −→ L2,

join two combinatorial spheres with the same complexity k + b−1
6 . If we are able to decompose each of these
transformations into a linear combination of less complex bistellar moves and elementary cycles, then all the
cycle can be represented as a sum of a cycle from Γ
and elementary cycles. We will process this step for
each of the moves with the biggest complexity separately. Remark that the number of vertices in L1 and L2
coincide, hence β is associated with an edge(not with a vertex). We denote this edge by σ.

b = 1.

If b = 1 both combinatorial spheres L1 and L2 contain vertices of degree 3.

Suppose that there is a vertex v, such that its degree is
equal to 3 in both spheres L1 and L2.
In this case the
cycle γ(L1, σ, v) is well-deﬁned. The support of the chain
β − γ(L1, σ, v) lies in the graph Γk

If there is no such vertex(with degree 3 in both spheres), then
there are such vertices v1 and v2, that the degree of v1 in L1
and L2 is equal to 3 and 4 respectively, and the degree of
v2 is equal to 4 and 3 respectively. Moreover, these vertices
are joined by an edge, because the degree of both of them
changed (one of them increasing, the other one decreasing)
after one bistellar move β associated with the edge σ. Then
the cycle γ(L1, σ, v) is not deﬁned. In this case a cycle δ of
the second type is deﬁned, and the support of the chain β − δ
lies in the graph Γk

If b = 3 both combinatorial spheres L1 and L2 do not contain vertices of degree 3, but contain a

vertex of degree 4. Let us split in two cases.

11

1. Both combinatorial spheres L1 and L2 contain a common
vertex of degree 4. We will denote it by v. Then the vertex v
does not participate in the move β. Consider the tetragon link v. L1
and L2 can not contain both diagonals of this tetragon. The move
β can be associated with the diagonal, but it can not replace one
diagonal of the tetragon link v with the other (if it is the case, then
L1 has 5 vertices and the move β is inessential). Thus, there is a
diagonal of link v that is not contained in both L1 and L2.

Denote one of the vertices of link v, not belonging to this diagonal, by w. In this case the cycle γ(L1, σ, vw)

is deﬁned, and the support of the chain β − γ(L1, σ, vw) lies in Γ

k+ 1

.

2. There are two vertices v1 and v2, participating
in β such that degL1 v1 = 4, degL2 v2 = 4. Moreover,
L1 contains not more than two vertices of degree 4, as
they should participate in the move β. Using Euler char-
acteristic it is easy to show that in this case there are at
least 8 vertices of degree 5 in L1. Then at least one of

these vertices does not belong to link v1S link v2, denote

such a vertex by w. Let us consider the pentagon link w.
L1 can contain at most 2 of its diagonals. Then there
is an edge adjacent to w such that the move, associated
with this edge, is deﬁned. Hence, all the cycle obtained
by commuting this move and the move β is deﬁned. So,
we receive three moves β1, β2 and β3, where each of
them can be represented as a linear combination of ele-
menary cycles and bistellar ﬂips with lower complexity
according to the previous case. The original move β can
be represented in the same way.

b = 5. Each of the combinatorial spheres L1 and L2 does not contain vertices of degrees 3 and 4.

In
this case L1 contains at least 12 vertices of degree 5. Among these 12 vertices there necessarily is a vertex
w such that it does not participate in β. Denote the vertices of link w by u1, u2, u3, u4 and u5 in any cyclic
order around w. From the ﬁve diagonals in the pentagon link w not more than two are present in each of the
combinatorial spheres L1 and L2. This means that there is at least one diagonal, missing from both spheres.
Without loss of generality, let this diagonal be u2u5. Then the elementary cycle γ(L1, σ, wu1) is deﬁned and
the chain β − γ(L1, σ, wu1) has its support in the graph Γ

b = 0. The moves β−1

and β2 reduce the number of vertices. The cycle γ(L1, σ1, σ2) is deﬁned always, if

L has more than 5 vertices. If L has 5 vertices, than the bistellar moves β−1

and β2 are equivalent.

b = 2. The complexes L1 and L2 contain vertices of degree 3, but L does not contain any vertices of degree
3, and contains vertices of degree 4. Then σ1 and σ2 are edges adjacent to some vertices v1 and v2 of degree 4.

If the cycle γ(L, σ1, σ2) is deﬁned, than β1 + β2 − γ(L, σ1, σ2) ∈ Γ
The cycle γ(L, σ1, σ2) is not deﬁned in the following cases:

except one case 5.3 described last.

1. The edges σ1 and σ2 are contained in
a common triangle of the combinatorial
sphere L, and their common vertex has
a degree exceeding 4. If the combinatorial
there L does not contain the edge w1w2 (the
notations are on the picture), then we can ap-
ply the composition of two elementary cycles
of the second type δ1 and δ2. Then new bistel-
lar moves, except two cancelling out, will be
less complex, and the support of the diﬀerence
β1 + β2 − δ1 − δ2 lies in the graph Γ

If the edge w1w2 already lies in L,
then we can delete it, applying a
composition of two elementary cycles
of the ﬁrst type, as shown on the ﬁg-
ure. New vertical bistellar moves,
except two cancelling out, have a
complexity less than a, and new hor-
izontal moves – not exceeding a. The
chain β1 + β2 + γ(L, σ1, w1, w2) −
γ(L, σ2, w1, w2) can be represented
in the desired form using the previ-
ous case for the sum β′
2. Then
β1 + β2 is represented as the sum of
the result for β′

tary cycles and vertical moves with
smaller complexities.

plex of the combinatorial sphere L, and the mutual ver-
tex of these edges is of degree 4. In this case the elementary

β1 + β2 − δ belongs to the graph Γ

3. The edges σ1 and σ2 are not contained in any common simplex, but their
links in L coincide, so the commutation of the bistellar moves βσ1 and βσ2
is impossible. Then there is two diﬀerent possibilities: σ1 and σ2 can have or not a
common vertex. Suppose that these edges do not intersect. Then let w be the vertex as
in the ﬁgure (it is possible that w = v2, this does not change the step of the algorithm).
The edge uw can not belong to the combinatorial sphere L, thus the move β3 = βv1w1 is
deﬁned. According to the previous case, the chain β1 + β3 can be decomposed in a linear
combination of elementary cycles and a chain with its support belonging to the graph
Γk+ 1
6 . The diﬀerence β2 − β3 can be decomposed using the cycle γ(L, σ2, v1w1). Then
the chain β1 + β2 can be decomposed in the same way as β1 + β2 = (β1 + β3) + (β2 − β3)

Now consider the case when σ1 and σ2 have a com-

If the diagonal u1u2 of the depicted
quadrangle does not belong to L then two elemen-
tary moves of the second type δ1 and δ2 are deﬁned,
and the complexity of all new moves except the can-
celling ones is lower than the complexity of β1 and
β2, hence the support of β1 + β2 − δ1 − δ2 belongs to
the graph Γ

Now suppose that the diagonal u1u2 is present in the sphere L. This case can be solved in the same way as
in case (1) (see ﬁgure above). Elementary cycles γ(L, σ1, w1w2) and γ(L, σ2, w1w2) are deﬁned. The chain
β1 + β2 + γ(L1, σ1, w1w2) − γ(L, σ2, w1w2) can then be represented as a sum of moves with complexity less than
a and two moves that can be represented in the desired way according to the precious case. So, we described
all the cases when the cycle γ(L1, σ1, σ2) is not deﬁned.

There is a unique case
4.
when the subtraction of the cycle
γ(L, σ1, σ2) from the chain β1 + β2
does not lower the complexity of
the chain. This happens if the
vertices v1 and v2 participate
in both moves β1 and β2.
In
this case the complexity of β1 +
β2 − γ(L1, σ1, σ2) does not become
lower than the complexity of the
initial chain β1 + β2. If the edge
denoted u1u2 is not present in L,
then two elementary moves of the
second type δ1 and δ2 are deﬁned.
All new moves except for two can-
celling ones have lower complexity
than a, ie the support of the chain
β1 + β2 − δ1 − δ2 belongs to the
graph Γ

If the edge u1u2 is present in the
combinatorial sphere L, then L can
not contain the edge denoted by
w1w2. Consider the chain β1 +β2 −
γ(L1, σ1, σ2). It can be represented
in the desired way, as w1w2 does
not belong to L and we can use
the previous case. Then β1 + β2
can be represented as a linear com-
bination of elementary moves and
moves with lower complexity.

b = 4. The combinatorial sphere L does not contain any vertices of degree 3 and 4, one of the vertices of
both σ1 and σ2 is of degree 5. Let v1 and v2, respectively, be those vertices. L contains not less than 12 vertices
of degree 5, wherein not more than 8 vertices participate in the moves β1 and β2. Hence there is a common
vertex of degree 5 in the three combinatorial spheres L1, L2 and L3. Denote this vertex by v. Among the 5
edges adjacent to v there are at least 3 edges such that moves associated with these edges are deﬁned. Denote
these vertices by e1, e2 and e3. Then the cycle γ(L1, σ1, ei), as well as the cycle γ(L, σ2, ei), is deﬁned for at
least two of three edges ei. Thus there is an i such that both cycles γ(L1, σ1, ei) and γ(L, σ2, ei) are deﬁned.
Then the support of the chain β1 + β2 − γ(L1, σ1, ei) + γ(L, σ2, ei) belongs to the graph Γk+ 1

similar to the case (4) for b = 2.

The last case appears if the degrees
of the vertices v1 and v2 do not de-

chain β1+β2−γ(L1, σ1, ei)+γ(L, σ2, ei).
Then the vertices v1 and v2 belong to
a common edge, as on the ﬁgure. If L
does not contain the edge denoted by
u1u2, then elementary cycles of the ﬁrst
type γ(L, σ1, v1w) and γ(L, σ2, v1w) are
deﬁned, and the support of the chain
β1+β2−γ(L, σ1, v1w)+γ(L, σ2, v1w) be-
longs to the graph Γk+ 1
2 . If L contains
the edge u1u2, then, as in the case (3)
for b = 2, the cycles γ(L, σ1, u1u2) and
γ(L, σ2, u1u2) are deﬁned and the chain
β1 + β2 + γ(L, σ1, u1u2) − γ(L, σ2, u1u2)
is
represented as a sum of moves
with lower complexities and two moves,
where the edge u1u2 is absent.

We proved the theorem stating that

Theorem 6. Any cycle in the graph Γ2 can be represented as a linear combination of elementary cycles.

This theorem has also been proved by Gaifullin [12] using Steinitz theorem, but the proof here is necessary
for the realization as it is completely explicit. The subcases for b = 2 and b = 4 where the cycle β1 + β2 −
γ(L1, σ1, ei) + γ(L, σ2, ei) is not deﬁned, as well as one subcase for b = 3 were added to complete the algorithm
from [13].

In the previous sections the proof of Theorem 1 has been reduced to the computation of p1(M 8

of M 8
15, there still will be more than 60 combinatorial types of link σ4. Hence the computation by hand is labor
intensive. But as this algorithm is completely combinatorial, it can be realized on a computer.

Checking if two given combinatorial spheres are isomorphic is a computationally hard problem. Gaifullin’s
algorithm operates with isomorphism classes of combinatorial manifolds (and bistellar moves). We would like
to avoid checks of sphere isomorphism for the program to work faster and the realization to be easier. Let us

introduce an additional construction for this purpose based on the graph Γ2. Deﬁne the graph eΓ2 as follows.

This graph has as vertices oriented combinatorial 2-spheres with vertices labeled by pairwise distinct natural
numbers (not necessarily successive), up to label preserving isomorphism, and its edges are equivalence classes
of bistellar moves, preserving orientation and respecting the labeling of vertices. If a vertex is added under a
bistellar move then it can have any possible label.

There is a natural map p : eΓ2 −→ Γ2, that forgets the vertex labeling of the sphere. The pull-back
p∗ : C1(Γ2, Q) −→ C1(eΓ2, Q) sends the cocycle h to a cocyle ˜h. We will call elementary cycles in eΓ2 the

The image of any elementary cycle in eΓ2 under the map p is an elementary cycle in Γ2. The algorithm of
cycle decomposition in the graph Γ2 is naturally transorted on the graph eΓ2. As ˜h = p∗(h), the value of ˜h on
an elementary cycle in eΓ2 is equal to the value of h on the image of this elementary cycle under the projection

on Γ2. Hence the values of the cocycle ˜h on elementary cycles are computed in the same way as the values of h.

Let the vertices of the initial complex K be labeled. Consider now the steps of the realization of the ﬁrst

Pontryagin class computation algorithm. The algorithm for a labeled complex consists of the following steps:

1. For every oriented (n − 4)–simplex σ of the complex K ﬁnd a sequence of moves ξσ, respecting the
labeling, that transform the link (with induced orientation) of σ into the boundary of a simplex. This
step is realized with the help of the program BISTELLAR [1] (the programming language is GAP [15]). The
algorithm used in this program is not a full algorithm checking the isomorphism of a given complex and
a combinatorial sphere (even in the 3-dimensional case) because no estimations are known on the time of
work of the program, but it works eﬀectively in all arising examples. The program BISTELLAR explicitly
ﬁnds a sequence of bistellar moves, gradually decreasing the number of vertices of the complex. In the
case of a combinatorial sphere this allows to descend to the boundary of a simplex.

2. For each vertex v of the link of every (n−4)-simplex σ (as well as all new vertices appearing in ξσ) consider
link link σ(v). Then each of the obtained complexes is a combinatorial 2-sphere. Induce the sequences ξσ
of bistellar moves on these complexes as on subcomplexes of link σ preserving the labeling. Denote the
sequence induced on the subcomplex link link σ(v) by ξσ,v. We should be careful about vertices that can
be added to link σ in moves used in ξσ, these new vertices shall also be considered. Denote by V (ξσ) the
set of all vertices that appear in the moves of the chain ξσ.

3. Let us choose a natural way to construct a chain κ(L) of moves between a combinatorial 2-sphere L
and the boundary of the 3-simplex (ie if two isomorphic combinatorial spheres L1 and L2 have the same
labelings, then the chosen chains will be isomorphic and identically labeled). For example, we can apply
the lexicographically ﬁrst possible bistellar move decreasing the complexity of the combinatorial sphere L
and in the same way descend to the boundary of the simplex. For each chain of moves ξσ,v, reducing a
combinatorial 2-sphere to the boundary of a 3-simplex, we have the chain ξσ,v − κ(link link σ(v)) from ∂∆3
to ∂∆3. The resulting simplexes can be labeled in diﬀerent ways. But boundaries of the simplex ∂∆3
labeled in diﬀerent ways can be joined with a sequence of moves respecting orientation in the following
way. Denote our boundaries of the simplex by ∂∆3
2 (with labels
u2, v2, w2 and z2). We will change the labels of the vertices one by one, for example, let us show the
sequence that changes the label u1 into u2. This will be a sequence consisting of three moves (add a vertex
with label u2, then make the vertex labeled u1 be of degree 3, then remove it):

1 (with labels u1, v1, w1 and z1) and ∂∆3

{{u1, v1, w1}, {u1, v1, z1}, {u1, w1, z1}, {v1, w1, z1}} −→

−→{{u1, w1, u2}, {u1, v1, u2}, {v1, w1, u2}, {u1, v1, z1}, {u1, w1, z1}, {v1, w1, z1}} −→
−→{{u1, w1, u2}, {u1, z1, u2}, {v1, w1, u2}, {u2, v1, z1}, {u1, w1, z1}, {v1, w1, z1}} −→
−→{{u2, v1, w1}, {u2, v1, z1}, {u2, w1, z1}, {v1, w1, z1}}

Moreover, we did not use combinatorial spheres with more than 5 vertices. It is easy to verify that new
moves constructing the chain between diﬀerently numerated ∂∆3 give no contribution the value of the
formula. Denote the chain joining ∂∆3

1 and ∂∆3

cohomology groups and compute the ﬁrst Pontryagin number we use the package simpcomp[7].

We need a remark for the step 3. The problem of the constructed chain κ is that it does not preserve the

localness of the formula as it depends on the numeration of the complex

Lemma 1 (Gaifullin, [12]). The homology class in the computation of the ﬁrst Pontryagin class does not
depend on the choice of closure of the chain in the graph Γ2 if the closure depends uniquely on the labeling of
the 2-sphere.

The author wrote a program using the programming language GAP[15] that realizes the algorithm. It takes

a simplicial complex and gives the ﬁrst Pontryagin class as well as the dual to it.
