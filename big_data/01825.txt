Abstract

We develop a new version of the superﬁeld Hamiltonian quantization. The main new
feature is that the BRST-BFV charge and the gauge ﬁxing Fermion are introduced on
equal footing within the sigma model approach, which provides for the actual use of
the quantum/derived antibrackets. We study in detail the generating equations for the
quantum antibrackets and their primed counterparts. We discuss the ﬁnite quantum
anticanonical transformations generated by the quantum antibracket.

Introduction

In the present paper we develop further the Hamiltonian superﬁeld quantization suggested in
[1, 2, 3]. The main new feature is that the BRST-BFV charge and the gauge ﬁxing fermion are
introduced on equal footing within the sigma model approach [4, 5, 6, 7], which provides for the
actual use of the quantum/derived antibrackets. We study in detail the generating equations
for the quantum antibrackets and their primed counterparts, as well as the ﬁnite quantum
anticanonical transformations generated by the quantum antibracket.
In this connection we
note also that the quantum antibrackets yield the eﬀective means of representation of gauge
ﬁelds via suitable BRST operator in the approach recently proposed [8].

As the BRST-BFV supersymmetry plays its fundamental role in the generalized Hamil-
tonian formalism for dynamical systems with ﬁrst-class constraints [9], it appears as a quite
natural idea to use the BRST-BFV superﬁelds as to develop the sigma-model-like approach
speciﬁc to the topological ﬁeld theories. With these regards, we suggest a total superﬁeld ac-
tion as a sum of the two dual sigma models related to the BRST-BFV charge and to the gauge
ﬁxing Fermion, respectively. In this way, we reproduce the superﬁeld covariant derivative in
kinetic part of the Hamiltonian action, while the unitarizing Hamiltonian itself appears in the
speciﬁc form of a supercommutator of the BRST -BFV charge and the gauge ﬁxing Fermion.
The latter general form of the unitarizing Hamiltonian is a characteristic feature of the general-
ized Hamiltonian formalism in its form invariant under reparametrizations of time. Then, the
main observation is that the mentioned general form of the unitarizing Hamiltonian rewrites in
a natural way entirely in terms of the two dual quantum antibrackets known to mathematicians
as ”derived brackets”. That is a ”synthetic” object constructed of double supercommutators of
its entries and the generating nilpotent Fermion. These derived brackets have been introduced
by mathematicians in [10, 11] (for further discussion see also [12, 13, 14]), and then, indepen-
dently, by physicists in [15, 16, 17]. These objects have very nice algebraic properties such as
the generalized Jacobi relations and the modiﬁed Leibnitz rule. In terms of the dual quantum
antibrackets, the unitarizing Hamiltonian splits additively into two commuting parts, which
implies the respective multiplicative splitting as to the evolution operator. We study in detail
the generating equations for all the quantum antibrackets and their primed counterparts as well.

2 Classical action for dual sigma models

Let

zA,

ε(zA) := εA, A = 1, ..., 2N,

(2.1)

be a set of canonical pairs coordinate-momentum of a dynamical system with constraints.

2

Let us consider the two dual partial actions of the respective sigma models for superﬁelds

zA(t, θ), 3

ΣΩ := Z dtdθ[VAθ∂tzA(−1)εA + Ω],
ΣΨ := Z dtdθ[VA∂θzA(−1)εA − Ψ].

Here in (2.2), (2.3) t and θ is a Boson and Fermion time variable,

respectively;

ε(t) = 0,

ε(θ) = 1,

VA = VA(z),

ε(VA) := εA,

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

is a symplectic potential whose shifted vorticity determines the respective covariant symplectic
metric

ωAB := ∂AVB + ∂BVA(−1)(εA+1)(εB +1);

Ω and Ψ is a BRST-BFV charge and a gauge-ﬁxing Fermion, respectively,

ε(Ω) = 1,

{Ω, Ω} = 0,

ε(Ψ) = 1,

{Ψ, Ψ} = 0,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

where a Poisson bracket is deﬁned as usual with the contravariant symplectic metric ωAB inverse
to (2.6),

{F, G} := F

←−
∂A ωAB−→

∂B G.

(2.9)

Now, the complete superﬁeld action is deﬁned as a sum of the partial actions (2.2) and (2.3),

where

Σ := ΣΩ + ΣΨ = Z dtdθ[VADzA(−1)εA + Q],

D := ∂θ + θ∂t,

ε(D) = 1, D2 =

1
2

[D, D] = ∂t,

(2.10)

(2.11)

is a superﬁeld covariant derivative, and a total Fermion generator (”Hamiltonian”),

Q := Ω − Ψ,

ε(Q) = 1,

{Q, Q} = −2{Ω, Ψ},

(2.12)

respectively. The complete action (2.10) yields the following superﬁeld equation of motion

DzA − {Q, zA} = 0.

(2.13)

3Here and in what follows we use the following normalization of Berezin’s integral R dθ θ = 1.

3

Due to (2.11), (2.12), it follows immediately from (2.13)

where

∂tzA + {H, zA} = 0,

H := −

1
2

{Q, Q} = {Ω, Ψ},

(2.14)

(2.15)

is a complete Boson Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian (2.15) provides for correct dynamical
description for general system with ﬁrst-class constraints, being the time sector (q0, p0) included
into the original set (2.1) as well, so that the time ﬁrst-class constraint has the form

T0 := p0 + H0,

(2.16)

with H0(z) being an original Hamiltonian [18, 19].

Now, let us consider in short the supersymmetry properties of the superﬁeld action (2.10).
It appears as a natural idea to consider the ”BRST” variation of the superﬁeld zA(t, θ) in the
form of a θ-translation

δzA(t, θ) := zA←−

∂θ µ .

(2.17)

As far as a Fermion parameter µ is a constant, the Jacobian of the transformation (2.17) equals
to one, because the derivative of the delta function of θ − θ′ equals to one. On the other hand,
by choosing µ in the form

µ :=

i

 Z dtdθ θ δQ(z(t, θ)) ,

(2.18)

with δQ being a ”desired” functional variation of Q (do not confuse with (2.17) !), we ﬁnd the
Jacobian

J = 1 +

i

 Z dtdθ θ (zA←−

∂θ )(δQ(z(t, θ))

←−
∂A)(−1)εA = 1 −

i

 Z dtdθ δQ(z(t, θ)) ,

(2.19)

which reproduces the ”desired” variation of the superﬁeld action (2.10). Here in (2.19), we
have integrated by part over θ

Z dθ θ (zA←−

∂θ )(δQ

∂A)(zA←−
←−

∂θ ) =

←−

∂A)(−1)εA = −Z dθ θ (δQ
∂θ ) = −Z dθ δQ .

←−

= −Z dθ θ (δQ

(2.20)

As to the variation of kinetic part of the superﬁeld action (2.10) under the variation (2.17) with
any µ, it has the form ( ωAB = const(z) )

− µZ dtdθ (∂θzB) ωBA DzA(−1)εA = −µZ dtdθ (∂θzB)(cid:0)ωBADzA(−1)εA + ∂BQ(cid:1).

(2.21)

4

where we have taken into account that

Z dθ (∂θzB)∂BQ = Z dθ ∂θQ = 0.

(2.22)

The expression in the second parentheses in the right-hand side in (2.21) is nothing else but
the left-hand side of the superﬁeld equations of motion for zB(t, θ). Thus we have shown that
the kinetic part of the superﬁeld action (2.10) is invariant under the variation (2.17) with any
µ, at the extremals of the whole superﬁeld action (2.10). On the other hand, the variation of
the rest of the superﬁeld action (2.10) under the variation (2.17) with any µ vanishes trivially
due to (2.22), while the µ (2.18) yields the Jacobian (2.19) that reproduces exactly the ”de-
sired” functional variation of the superﬁeld action (2.10) under the ”desired ” variation δQ. As
usual in the theories with weak global supersymmetries, the statements proven are suﬃcient
to conclude that the superﬁeld path integral constructed of the superﬁeld action (2.10) is inde-
pendent of the ”desired” variations of the gauge ﬁxing Fermion Ψ. The latter conclusion can
be conﬁrmed in an independent way via the well-known proof within the component formalism
(see Appendix).

3 Quantum dynamics and quantum antibrackets

As to the quantum description, we proceed with the operator valued form of the equations
of motion (2.13), (2.14), and the Hamiltonian (2.15), where all Poisson brackets should be
replaced by the respective commutators multiplied by (i)−1,

{F, G} → (i)−1[F, G],

[F, G] := F G − GF (−1)εF εG.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume in what follows below that

(i)−1[zA(t), zB(t)] = ωAB = const(z).

Due to (3.1), the Hamiltonian (2.15) takes the operator valued form

H := (i)−1[Ω, Ψ].

Then the equation of motion for an operator A(z) reads

∂tA = (i)−2[A, [Ω, Ψ]].

For any two operators F and G, let us deﬁne their quantum Ω-antibracket [15]

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(F, G)Ω : =

([F, [Ω, G]] − (F ↔ G)(−1)(εF +1)(εG+1)) =

= [[Ω, F ], G](−1)εF +1 +

5

2

[Ω, [F, G]](−1)εF .

(3.5)

By deﬁnition (3.5) it follows an important formula

[Ω, (F, G)Ω] = [[Ω, F ], [Ω, G]].

(3.6)

These quantum antibrackets have very nice algebraic properties. First of all, we mention their
Jacobi identity in a purely Boson sector

6(B, (B, B)Ω)Ω = [[B, (B, B)Ω], Ω],

ε(B) = 0.

(3.7)

Then we apply the diﬀerential polarization procedure. By choosing the Boson B in the form

B = αF + βG + γH,

(3.8)

where F, G, H are any operators whose Grassmann parities coincide with the ones of the pa-
rameters α, β, γ, respectively, we then apply the operator

∂α∂β∂γ(−1)(εα+1)(εγ +1)+εβ +1,

(3.9)

to the relation (3.7), to derive the general form of the Jacobi identity

(F, (G, H)Ω)Ω(−1)(εF +1)(εH +1) + cycle(F, G, H) = −

1
2

[(F, G, H)Ω(−1)(εF +1)(εH +1), Ω], (3.10)

where

(F, G, H)Ω =

1
3

(−1)(εF +1)(εH +1)([F, (G, H)Ω](−1)εG+εF (εH +1) + cycle(F, G, H)),

(3.11)

is the so-called quantum 3 - antibracket. The generalized Leibnitz rule for the quantum an-
tibracket reads

1

(F G, H)Ω − F (G, H)Ω − (F, H)ΩG(−1)εG(εH +1) =
2 (cid:0)[F, H][G, Ω](−1)εH (εG+1) + [F, Ω][G, H](−1)εG(cid:1) .

=

Now, let us turn again to the double commutator in the right-hand side in (3.4).
remarkable fact that [16, 17]

[A, [Ω, Ψ]] =

((A, Ψ)Ω + (A, Ω)Ψ),

together with4

(3.12)

It is a

(3.13)

[adΩ(Ψ), adΨ(Ω)]A := (Ψ, (Ω, A)Ψ)Ω − (Ω ↔ Ψ) = 0,

(3.14)

4If one does not assume the nilpotency (2.8) as for the gauge Fermion Ψ, then the right-hand side of the
2 [Ψ, Ψ])A, while the formula (3.13) remains the

2 [Ψ, Ψ], A)Ω] = − 1

4 ad(Ω)adΩ( 1

formula (3.14) becomes − 1
same.

4 [Ω, ( 1

which means in turn that the evolution operator

exp{−(i)−1tH},

(3.15)

does factorize into a product of the two commuting operators deﬁned by the respective two
terms in the right-hand side in (3.13), that is

tibracket.

4 Generating operator for higher quantum antibrackets

Let us consider a chain of operators fa and parameters λa,

{fa(z); λa|ε(fa) = ε(λa) := εa, a = 1, ..., n, ...},

to deﬁne the Fermion nilpotent generating operator

Ω(λ) := exp{−F }Ω exp{F }, F := faλa,

ε(Ω(λ)) := 1,

[Ω(λ), Ω(λ)] = 0.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

In terms of the generating operator (4.2) the n − th quantum antibracket is deﬁned as [16]

(fa1, ..., fan)Ω := −Ω(λ)

←−
∂ a1...

←−
∂ an|λ=0(−1)En,

where

In more detail, we have

En :=

[ n−1
2 ]

Xk=0

εa2k+1.

(fa1, ..., fan)Ω = −[...[Ω, fb1], ..., fbn]Sbn...b1

a1...an(−1)En,

with the symmetrizer being deﬁned as

n!Sbn...b1

a1...an := (λbn...λb1←−

∂ a1...

←−
∂ an),

∂a :=

∂
∂λa .

7

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

All the Jacobi relations for higher quantum antibrackets are accumulated in the nilpotency
equation (4.3). In terms of the generating operator (4.2) together with the operator

Ra(λ) := exp{−F }(cid:16)exp{F }

←−

∂ a(cid:17) ,

the following closed set of the generating equations holds

Ω(λ)

←−
∂ a = [Ω(λ), Ra(λ)],

Ra(λ)

←−
∂ b − (a ↔ b)(−1)εaεb = [Ra(λ), Rb(λ)],

Ω(λ = 0) = Ω, Ra(λ = 0) = fa.

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

In turn, these generating equations do imply further equations for primed quantum antibrackets
deﬁned as

(fa1, ..., fan)′

Ω := −Ω(λ)

←−
∂ a1...

←−
∂ an(−1)En.

(4.12)

In particular, for primed quantum 2-antibracket we get

(fa, fb)′

Ω = (Ra(λ), Rb(λ))Ω(λ) −

[Ω(λ), Ra(λ)

←−
∂ b + (a ↔ b)(−1)εaεb](−1)εa.

5 Finite quantum anticanonical transformations

In Section 3, we have already mentioned ﬁnite quantum anticanonical transformations
(3.16), (3.17). Now we are in a position to present such transformations explicitly in their
most general setting. Let λ be a boson parameter, ε(λ) = 0. Given an operator A, deﬁne then
the transformed operator as

to satisfy the equation

A′ := exp{λ adΩ(Ψ)}A,

∂λA′ = (Ψ, A′)Ω, A′(λ = 0) = A.

Its explicit solution has the form [20]

(5.1)

(5.2)

A′ = ˜A(λ) −

where

1

2 Z λ

0

dλ′ exp(cid:26)λ − λ′

2

[Ω, Ψ](cid:27) [Ω, [Ψ, ˜A(λ′)]] exp(cid:26)−

λ − λ′

2

[Ω, Ψ](cid:27) , (5.3)

˜A(λ) = exp{λ[Ω, Ψ]}A exp{−λ[Ω, Ψ]}.

(5.4)

8

By interchanging Ω ↔ Ψ in (5.3), we get the transformation dual to (5.3). In this way, the
operators (3.16), (3.17) are reproduced at

λ = −(i)−2t

2
3

.

(5.5)

Also, notice that the quantum antibracket of the two transformed operators A′ and B ′

satisﬁes the equation [20]

∂λ(A′, B ′)Ω = (Ψ, (A′, B ′)Ω)Ω +

1
2

[(Ψ, A′, B ′)Ω, Ω] ,

(5.6)

that follows from (5.2) for A′ and B ′, together with the Jacobi relation (3.10).

Explicit solution to the equation (5.6) has the form

(A′(λ), B ′(λ))Ω = (A, B)′

Ω(λ) +

1

2 Z λ

0

dλ′ exp{(λ − λ′)adΩ(Ψ)}[(Ψ, A′(λ′), B ′(λ′))Ω, Ω], (5.7)

where all primed operators are deﬁned similarly to (5.1). For instance, the ﬁrst term in the
right-hand side in (5.7) is decoded as

exp{λ adΩ(Ψ)}(A, B)Ω,

(5.8)

not to be confused with (4.13)!

6 Finite transformations of general open group:

integrating arbi-

trary involutions [15, 21]

Let

{φa|ε(φa) := εa = ε(Ta)},

(6.1)

be a set of parameters of gauge transformations generated by the ﬁrst-class constraints Ta
encoded in the BRST-BFV operator Ω. Let us consider the general Lie equation for an operator
valued transformation A0 → A(φ),

A(φ)

←−
∂ a = (i)−1[A(φ), Ya(φ)],

A(φ = 0) = A0,

∂a :=

∂
∂φa ,

ε(Ya) := εa.

Integrability of that equation requires

←−
∂ b − (a ↔ b)(−1)εaεb = (i)−1[Ya, Yb].

Ya

9

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

We choose the operators Ya in the form generated by the one Ω,

Ya(φ) := (i)−1[Ω, Ωa(φ)],

ε(Ωa) := εa + 1.

The form (6.6) implies that

[Ω, A0] = 0 ⇒ [Ω, A(φ)] = 0.

Then, the integrability (6.5) together with the choice (6.6) implies that

A

←−
∂ a = (i)−2(A, Ωa)Ω + (i)−2 1
2

[[A, Ωa], Ω](−1)εa,

(6.6)

←−
∂ b − (a ↔ b)(−1)εaεb = (i)−2(Ωa, Ωb)Ω −

Ωa

2

(i)−1[Ω, Ωab],

(6.10)

In its own turn, the integrability condition (6.10) requires further integrability conditions, and
so on. It is a remarkable fact that all these subsequent integrability conditions are naturally
accumulated in a single quantum master equation

(S, S)∆ = i[∆, S],

ε(S) = 0,

∆ := Ω + ηaπa(−1)εa, ∆2 = 0,

where

with

being momenta canonically conjugated to φa,

πa,

ε(πa) := εa,

and

[φa, πb] = iδa
b ,

ηa,

ε(ηa) := εa + 1,

being new ghost variables viewed as parameters. As we have by deﬁnition

the master equation (6.11) implies

(S, S)∆ = [S, [∆, S]],

[∆, (S, S)∆] = 0 ⇒ [∆, S]2 = 0.

Now, let G be the standard ghost number operator,

[G, Ω] = iΩ.

(6.18)

Let us seek for a solution to the master equation (6.11) in the form of an η -power series
expansion,

S(φ, η) = G + ηa Ωa(φ) +

(6.20)

(6.21)

(6.22)

The coeﬃcient operators Ωa1...an in the expansion (6.19) have the properties

ε(Ωa1...an) = εa1 + ... + εan + n,

[G, Ωa1...an] = −ni Ωa1...an.

In the zeroth and ﬁrst orders in η, the master equation (6.11) is satisﬁed identically. However,
in the second order, it yields exactly (6.10). In the third order in η it yields

(i)−2(Ωa, Ωbc)Ω −

2
3

(i)−1[Ωabc, Ω],

(6.23)

which is exactly the integrability condition to (6.10). A natural automorphism of the master
equation (6.11) is given by

S → S ′ := exp{−(i)−2[∆, Ξ]} S exp{(i)−2[∆, Ξ]},

(6.24)

where Ξ is an arbitrary odd operator. For inﬁnitesimal transformation we have

δS = (i)−2[S, [∆, Ξ]] = (i)−2 2

3(cid:0)(S, Ξ)∆ + (S, ∆)Ξ(cid:1),

δ21S := [δ2, δ1]S = (i)−2[S, [∆, Ξ21]],

Ξ21 = (i)−2(Ξ2, Ξ1)∆.

(6.25)

(6.26)

(6.27)

If the transformation (6.24) acts transitively on the set of solutions to the master equation
(6.11), then the general solution is

S = exp{−(i)−2[∆, Ξ]} G exp{(i)−2[∆, Ξ]}.

(6.28)

11

Now, let us consider the transformation

S(α) := exp{iαF/} S exp{−iαF/},

∆(α) := exp{iαF/} ∆ exp{−iαF/},

(6.29)

(6.30)

where α is an even parameter, and F is an arbitrary even operator. If S and ∆ satisfy the
master equation (6.11), then S(α) and ∆(α) satisfy the transformed master equation

(S(α), S(α))∆(α) = i[∆(α), S(α)].

If F is restricted to satisfy itself the master equation (6.11), i. e.

then

and ∆(α) in (6.30) reduces to

(F, F )∆ = i[∆, F ],

∆′′(α) + ∆′(α) = 0,

∆(α) = ∆ + (i)−1[∆, F ](1 − exp{−α}).

(6.31)

(6.32)

(6.33)

(6.34)

For F = S, in particular, S satisﬁes the master equation (6.11) with ∆ replaced by ∆(α) in
(6.34), where F is replaced by S.

7 Discussion

The main result of the present consideration is that the dynamical evolution of an arbitrary
dynamical system with ﬁrst-class constraints is represented entirely in terms of the two dual
quantum antibrackets related to the two nilpotent Fermion operators, the BRST-BFV charge
and the gauge-ﬁxing Fermion. Although in the standard BRST-BFV scheme there is no need
to impose the nilpotency requirement as to the gauge Fermion, in the sigma model approach
developed above that requirement should be imposed certainly on equal footing upon both the
BRST-BFV charge and the gauge ﬁxing Fermion. If one allows for the gauge-ﬁxing Fermion
operator to deviate from being nilpotent, then the closed character of the description in terms
of the dual quantum antibrackets will be failed immediately. It should be noticed however that
the standard properties of gauge invariance in the physical sector remain maintained in the
latter case, as well.

be a component expansion to the superﬁeld in the left-hand side of the ﬁrst in (A.1). First, let
us reproduce in terms of the component expansion (A.1) the above Jacobian (2.19). The θ -
translation (2.17) takes the form

θ → θ + µ,

where the ”parameter” µ is chosen in the form of the functional (2.18),

µ =

i

 Z dtdθ θ δQ(z(t, θ)) =

i

 Z dt δQ(z0(t)).

Here, the translation (A.2) induces the component variations

δzA

0 (t) = µzA

1 (t),

δzA

1 (t) = 0.

Due to the choice (A.3), the variations (A.4) yield the Jacobian

J = 1 +Z dt (δzA

0 (t))

Thus, we have reproduced exactly the Jacobian (2.19) within the component formalism.

By substituting the component form (A.1) into the superﬁeld action (2.10), we get

Σ = Z dt(cid:20)1

Under the variation in the ﬁrst in (A.4), the variation of kinetic part of the action Σ (A.6)
reads

Z dt µzB

1 (ωBA∂tzA

0 + ∂BzA

1 ∂AQ(z0)).

(A.7)

Here in (A.7), the second term does not contribute actually due to the nilpotency property

(zA

1 ∂A)2 = 0.

(A.8)

The expression inside the parentheses in (A.7) is nothing else but the left-hand side of the
motion equation for zB
0 as to the action Σ (A.6). Thus, the expression (A.7) is a component
counterpart to (2.21).

Within the path integral

Z =: Z Dz0Dz1 exp(cid:26) i



Σ(cid:27) ,

by taking the Gaussian integral over z1, one arrives at the expression

Z = Z Dz0p sDet (ω) exp(cid:26) i



Σ0(cid:27) ,

where the zero-th sector action Σ0 is given by

Σ0 := Z dt(cid:20) 1

where the Hamiltonian in the zero-th sector is given by

{Q, Q}(z0).

(A.9)

(A.10)

(A.11)

(A.12)

As usual, the Gaussian integral over z1 is equivalent, up to the constant factor of p sDet (ω),

to eliminating the z1 component by resolving the classical equation for z1,

in the form

which is equivalent to

ωBAzA

1 (−1)εA + ∂BQ(z0) = 0,

zA
1 = −ωAB∂BQ(z0)(−1)εA,

zA
1 = {Q, zA

(A.13)

(A.14)

(A.15)

By substituting the latter into the component action (A.6), we get exactly the zero-th sector
action (A.11).

Now, let us consider the inﬁnitesimal BRST-BFV transformation,

δzA

0 := {zA

0 , Q(z0)}µ.

(A.16)

As far as a BRST- BFV parameter µ is a constant, the action (A.11) and the measure in (A.10)
are invariant under the transformation (A.16). Then let us choose in (A.16) the µ in the form

µ :=

i

 Z dtδQ(z0),

(A.17)

where δQ is the desired functional variation of Q. As the µ (A.17) is not a *function* of the
phase variables z0(t), the action (A.11) remains invariant under the transformation (A.16),
(A.17). However the functional (A.17) yields the following inﬁnitesimal Jacobian to the latter
transformation,

J := 1 −

i

 Z dt{Q, δQ}(z0),

(A.18)

which is exactly the desired functional variation of the action (A.11). Thus, we have shown
that the integral (A.9) remains stable under the desired functional variations δQ.
