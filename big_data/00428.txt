Abstract

This paper is devoted to existence and non-existence results for generalized tran-
sition waves solutions of space-time heterogeneous Fisher-KPP equations. When the
coeﬃcients of the equation are periodic in space but otherwise depend in a fairly gen-
eral fashion on time, we prove that such waves exist as soon as their speed is suﬃciently
large in a sense. When this speed is too small, transition waves do not exist anymore,
this result holds without assuming periodicity in space. These necessary and suﬃcient
conditions are proved to be optimal when the coeﬃcients are periodic both in space
and time. Our method is quite robust and extends to general non-periodic space-time
heterogeneous coeﬃcients, showing that transition waves solutions of the nonlinear
equation exist as soon as one can construct appropriate solutions of a given linearized
equation.

Introduction

We are concerned with transition waves solutions of the space-time heterogeneous reaction-
diﬀusion equation

∂tu − Tr(A(x, t)D2u) + q(x, t) · Du = f (x, t, u),

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

Here D and D2 denote respectively the gradient and the Hessian with respect to the space
variables. We assume that the terms in the equation are periodic in x, with the same period.
The matrix ﬁeld A is uniformly elliptic and the nonlinearity f (x, t,·) vanishes at 0 and 1.
The steady states 0 and 1 are respectively unstable and stable.

When the coeﬃcients do not depend on (x, t), equation (1) becomes a classical homo-
geneous monostable reaction-diﬀusion equation. The pioneering works on such equations
are due to Kolmogorov, Petrovski and Piskunov [12] and Fisher [11] in the 30’s, when
f (u) = u(1 − u). They investigated the existence of travelling wave solutions, that is,
solutions of the form u(x, t) = φ(x · e − ct), with φ(−∞) = 1, φ(+∞) = 0, φ > 0. The
quantity c ∈ R is the speed of the wave and e ∈ SN −1 is its direction. Kolmogorov, Petrovski
and Piskunov [12] proved that when A = IN , q ≡ 0 and f = u(1−u), there exists c∗ > 0 such
that (1) admits travelling waves of speed c if and only if c ≥ c∗. This property was extended
to more general monostable nonlinearities by Aronson and Weinberger [2]. The properties
(uniqueness, stability, attractivity, decay at inﬁnity) of these waves have been extensively
studied since then.

An increasing attention has been paid to heterogeneous reaction-diﬀusion since the 2000’s.
In particular, the existence of appropriate generalizations of travelling waves solutions has
been proved for various classes of heterogeneities such as shear [9], time periodic [1], space
periodic [3, 7, 29], space-time periodic [20, 16], time almost periodic [24] and time uniquely
ergodic [26] ones, under several types of hypotheses on the nonlinearity. Now, the topical
question is to understand whether reaction-diﬀusion equations with general heterogeneous
coeﬃcients admit wave-like solutions or not. A generalization of the notion of travelling
waves has been given by Berestycki and Hamel [4, 5].
Deﬁnition 1.1. [4, 5] A generalized transition wave (in the direction e ∈ SN −1) is a positive
time-global solution u of (1) such that there exists a function c ∈ L∞(R) satisfying
c(s)ds, t(cid:17) = 0,

c(s)ds, t(cid:17) = 1,
uniformly with respect to t ∈ R 1. The function c is called the speed of the generalized
transition wave u, and φ(x, t) := u(x + eR t

0 c(s)ds, t) is the associated proﬁle.

The proﬁle of a generalized transition wave satisﬁes

u(cid:16)x + eZ t

It is clear that any perturbation of c obtained by adding a function with bounded integral is
still a speed of u, with a diﬀerent proﬁle. Reciprocally, if ˜c is another speed associated with

means that

u, then it is easy to check that t 7→R t

0 (c− ˜c) is bounded. Obviously, all the notions of waves
used previously when the coeﬃcients belong to particular classes of heterogeneities can be
viewed as transition waves.

The existence of such waves have been proved for one-dimensional space heterogeneous
reaction-diﬀusion with ignition-type nonlinearities (that is, f (x, u) = 0 if u ∈ [0, θ)∪{1} and
f (x, u) > 0 if u ∈ (θ, 1)) in parallel ways by Nolen and Ryzhik [21] and Mellet, Roquejoﬀre
and Sire [15], and their stability was proved in [14]. For space heterogeneous monostable
nonlinearities, when f (x, u) > 0 when u ∈ (0, 1) and f (x, 0) = f (x, 1) = 0, transition
waves might not exist [19] in general. Let mention that this justiﬁed the introduction of the
alternative notion of critical travelling wave by the ﬁrst author in [17] for one-dimensional
equations. Some existence results have also been obtained by Zlatos for partially periodic
multi-dimensional equations of ignition-type [30].

When the coeﬃcients only depend on t in a general way, the existence of transition waves
was ﬁrst proved by Shen for bistable nonlinearities [25] (that is, nonlinearities vanishing at
u = 0 and u = 1 but negative near these two equilibria) and for monostable equations with
time uniquely ergodic coeﬃcients [26]. The case of general time heterogeneous monostable
equations was investigated by the two authors in [18]. As observed in [18], the notions of
least and upper mean play a crucial role in such frameworks.

Deﬁnition 1.2. The least mean (resp. the upper mean) over R of a function g ∈ L∞(R) is
given by

⌊g⌋ := lim

As shown in Proposition 3.1 of [18], the deﬁnitions of ⌊g⌋, ⌈g⌉ do not change if one
replaces limT →+∞ with supT >0 and inf T >0 respectively in the above expressions; this shows
that ⌊g⌋, ⌈g⌉ are well deﬁned for any g ∈ L∞(R). Notice that g admits a uniform mean hgi,
that is hgi := limT →+∞
g(s)ds exists uniformly with respect to t ∈ R, if and only if
⌊g⌋ = ⌈g⌉ = hgi. This is the case in particular when the coeﬃcients are uniquely ergodic.
Note that if c and ˜c are two speeds associated with the same wave u, then c − ˜c has a
bounded integral and thus ⌊c⌋ = ⌊˜c⌋.
The two authors proved in [18] that when A ≡ IN , q ≡ 0 and f only depends on (t, u)
and is concave and positive with respect to u ∈ (0, 1), there exists a speed c∗ > 0 such that
for all γ > c∗ and |e| = 1, equation (1) admits a generalized transition wave with speed
c = c(t) in the direction e such that ⌊c⌋ = γ, while no such waves exist when γ < c∗.

When the coeﬃcients not only depend on t in a general way but also on x periodically,
some of the above results have been extended. Assuming in addition that the coeﬃcients
are uniquely ergodic and recurrent with respect to t and that A ≡ IN , Shen [28] proved the
existence of a speed c∗ such that for all γ > c∗, there exists a generalized transition waves
for monostable equations with speed c

The case of space periodic and time general monostable equations was ﬁrst studied by
the second author and Ryzhik [23], under the additional assumption that the dependences
in t and x are separated, in the sense that A and q only depend on x, periodically, while f

3

only depends on (t, u). They proved both the existence of generalized transition waves of
speed c such that ⌊c⌋ > c∗ and the non-existence of such waves with ⌊c⌋ < c∗. Moreover,
they provided a more general non-existence result, without assuming that the dependence
on x of A and q is periodic.

The aim of the present paper is to consider the general case of coeﬃcients depending on

both x and t. As in [23], we assume the periodicity in x only for the existence result.

2 Hypotheses and results

2.1 Statement of the main results

Throughout the paper, the terms in (1) will always be assumed to satisfy the following
(classical) regularity hypotheses:

(A is symmetric, uniformly continuous,
∀(x, t) ∈ RN +1, αI ≤ A(x, t) ≤ αI,
∃ 0 < α ≤ α,
q is bounded and uniformly continuous on RN +1,

(f is a Caratheodory function on RN +1 × [0, 1],
∃δ > 0, f (x, t,·) ∈ W 1,∞([0, 1]) ∩ C 1([0, δ)), uniformly in (x, t) ∈ RN +1.

(3)

(4)

(5)

The assumption that q is uniformly continuous is a technical hypothesis used in the proofs
to pass to the limit in sequences of translations of the equation. It could be replaced by
div q = 0. We further assume that f is of monostable type, 0 being the unstable equilibrium
and 1 being the stable one. Namely,

∀(x, t) ∈ RN +1,
∀(x, t) ∈ RN +1,
inf

∀u ∈ (0, 1),

f (x, t, 0) = 0,

f (x, t, 1) = 0,

f (x, t, u) > 0.

(x,t)∈RN +1

(6)

(7)

(8)

In order to derive the existence result, we need some additional hypotheses. The ﬁrst one is
the standard KPP condition:

∀(x, t) ∈ RN +1, u ∈ [0, 1],

f (x, t, u) ≤ µ(x, t)u,

(9)

where, here and in the sequel, µ denotes the function deﬁned as follows:

Conditions (8), (9) imply that inf µ > 0. The second condition is

µ(x, t) := ∂uf (x, t, 0).

∃C > 0, δ, ν ∈ (0, 1],

∀x ∈ RN , t ∈ R, u ∈ (0, δ),

f (x, t, u) ≥ µ(x, t)u − Cu1+ν.

(10)

4

Note that a suﬃcient condition for (10) to hold is f (x, t,·) ∈ C 1+ν([0, δ]), uniformly with
respect to x, t. The last condition for the existence result is

∃l = (l1, . . . , lN ) ∈ RN
+ ,

∀t ∈ R, u ∈ (0, 1), A, q, f are l-periodic in x,

(11)

where a function g is said to be l-periodic in x if it satisﬁes

∀j ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ∀x ∈ RN ,

g(x + ljej) = g(x),

(e1, . . . , eN ) being the canonical basis of RN .

When we say that a function is a (sub, super) solution of (1) we always mean that it
is between 0 and 1. We deal with strong solutions whose derivatives ∂t, D, D2 belong to
some Lp(RN +1), p ∈ (1,∞). Many of our statements and equations, such as (1), are under-
stood to hold a.e., even if we omit to specify it, and inf, sup are used in place of ess inf, ess sup.

The main results of this paper consist in a suﬃcient and a necessary conditions for the

existence of generalized transition waves, expressed in terms of their speeds.
Theorem 2.1. Under the assumptions (3)-(11), for all e ∈ SN −1, there exists c∗ ∈ R such
that for every γ > c∗, there is a generalized transition wave in the direction e with a speed c
such that ⌊c⌋ = γ.

The minimal speed c∗ we construct is explicitly given by (29), (34) and (37). A natural
question is to determine whether our construction gives an optimal speed or not, that is,
do generalized transition waves with speed c such that ⌊c⌋ < c∗ exist? One naturally starts
with checking if our c∗ coincides with the optimal speed known to exist in some particular
cases, such as space-time periodic or space independent. In Section 2.3 we show that this is
the case. The answer in the general, non space-periodic, case is only partial. It is contained
in the next theorem, where, however, we can relax the monostability hypotheses (8)-(9) by

(cid:22) inf

x∈RN

µ(x,·)(cid:23) > 0,

(12)

and we can drop (7), (10) as well as (11). We actually need an extra regularity assumption
on A:

A is uniformly H¨older-continuous in x, uniformly with respect to t.

(13)

This ensures the validity of some a priori Lipschitz estimates quoted from [22], that will be
needed in the sequel. It is not clear to us if such estimates hold without (13).
Theorem 2.2. Under the assumptions (3)-(6), (12)-(13), for all e ∈ SN −1, there exists
c∗ ∈ R such that if c is the speed of a generalized transition wave in the direction e then
⌊c⌋ ≥ c∗.

We point out that no spatial-periodicity condition is assumed in the previous statement.
In order to prove Theorem 2.2 we derive a characterization of the least mean - Proposition 4.1
below - that we believe being of independent interest. The deﬁnition of c∗ is given in Section
4. Of course, c∗ ≤ c∗ if the hypotheses of both Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 are fulﬁlled. We do not

5

know if, in general, c∗ = c∗, that is, if the speed c∗ is minimal, in the sense that there does not
exist any wave with a speed having a smaller least mean. When the coeﬃcients are periodic
in space and time or only depend on time, we could identify the speed c∗ more explicitly
(see Section 2.3 below). Indeed, we recover in these frameworks some characterizations of
the speeds identiﬁed in earlier papers [16, 18, 23], which were proved to be minimal. In the
general framework, we leave this question open.

Finally, we leave as an open problem the case ⌊c⌋ = c∗, for which we believe that gener-

alized transition waves still exist.

2.2 Optimality of the monostability assumption

The assumption (8) implies that 0 and 1 are respectively unstable and stable. Let us discuss
the meaning and the optimality of this hypothesis, which might seem strong. Actually, as
we do not make any additional assumption on the coeﬃcients, we can consider much more
general asymptotic states p− = p−(x, t) < p+ = p+(x, t) in place of 0 and 1, and try to
construct generalized transition waves v connecting p− to p+. Indeed, if p± are solutions to
(1), with p+ − p− bounded and having positive inﬁmum, then the change of variables

v(x, t) − p−(x, t)
p+(x, t) − p−(x, t)
leads to an equation of the same form, with reaction term

u(x, t) :=

˜f (x, t, u) :=

f (x, t, up+ + (1 − u)p−) − uf (x, t, p+) − (1 − u)f (x, t, p−)

p+ − p−

.

The new equation admits the steady states 0 and 1. Moreover, assuming that u 7→ f (x, t, u)
is strictly concave, then ˜f satisﬁes conditions (8), (9), the latter following from the inequality

∀u ∈ (0, 1),

u(p+ − p−)∂uf (x, t, p−) ≥ f (x, t, up+ + (1 − u)p−) − f (x, t, p−).

This shows that, somehow, the concavity hypothesis of the nonlinearity with respect to u is
stronger, up to some change of variables, than the positivity hypothesis of the nonlinearity.
Let us illustrate the above procedure with an explicit example where p− ≡ 0. Consider
(14)

the equation

with µ periodic in x, bounded and such that inf µ > 0. The later condition implies that the
solution 0 is linearly unstable (actually, it can be relaxed by (12), see the discussion below).
Then one can check that there is a time-global solution p = p(x, t) which is bounded, has a
positive inﬁmum and is periodic in x. Let u := v/p. This function satisﬁes

∂tv = ∆v + µ(x, t)v − v2,

x ∈ RN ,

t ∈ R,

∂tu = ∆u + 2∇p

p · ∇u + p(x, t)u(1 − u),

which is an equation of the form (1) for which (9)-(11) hold, at least if, for instance, µ is
uniformly H¨older-continuous, since then ∇p is bounded by Schauder’s parabolic estimates,
and inf p > 0.

6

Following this example, one can wonder whether (8) is an optimal condition (up to some
change of variables) for the existence of transition waves. It is well-known that other classes
of nonlinearities, such as bistable or ignition ones, could still give rise to transition waves
(see for instance [3]). Thus, this question only makes sense if one reduces to the class of
nonlinearities which are monostable, in a sense. Let us assume that f satisﬁes (6), (7) and
that 0 is linearly unstable, in the weak sense that (12) holds. Then, using the properties
of the least mean derived in [18], one can construct arbitrarily small subsolutions u = u(t)
and thus, as 1 is a positive solution, there exists a minimal solution p of (1) in the class of
bounded solutions with positive inﬁmum. One could then check that our proof still works
and gives rise to generalized transition waves connecting 0 to p. Indeed, condition (8) only
ensures that p ≡ 1. As a conclusion, the positivity hypothesis (8) is not optimal: one could
replace it by (12) but then the generalized transition waves we construct connect 0 to the
minimal time-global solution, which might not be 1.

Since for the existence of positive solutions it is suﬃcient to require (12) rather than
inf µ > 0, one may argue that, in order to guarantee that 1 is the minimal time-global
solution with positive inﬁmum, hypothesis (8) could be relaxed by

∀u ∈ (0, 1), (cid:22) min

x∈RN

f (x,·, u)(cid:23) > 0.

(15)

This is not true, as shown by the following example. Let p ∈ C 1(R) be a strictly decreasing
function such that p(±∞) ∈ (0, 1). Let f satisfy f (t, p(t)) = p′(t). It is clear that f can be
extended in such a way that (15) holds; however p is a time-global solution of ∂tu = f (t, u)
with positive inﬁmum which is smaller than 1.

Finally, if 0 is linearly stable, in the sense that

(cid:24) sup

x∈RN

µ(x,·)(cid:25) < 0

(16)

holds, and (9) is satisﬁed, then there do not exist generalized transition waves at all, and,
more generally, solutions to the Cauchy problem with bounded initial data converge uni-
formly to 0 as t → ∞.
Indeed, as an easy application of the property of the least (and
upper) mean (39), one can construct a supersolution u = eσ(t)−εt, for some σ ∈ W 1,∞(R)
and ε > 0. The convergence to 0 of bounded solutions then follows from the comparison
principle.

2.3 Description of the method and application to particular cases

The starting point of the construction of generalized transition waves consists in ﬁnding an
explicit expression for the speed. This is not a trivial task in the case of mixed space-time
dependence considered in this paper. We achieve it by an heuristic argument, that we now
illustrate.

Suppose that u is a generalized transition wave in a direction e ∈ SN −1. Its tail at large

x · e is close from being a solution of the linearized equation around 0:
∂tu − Tr(A(x, t)D2u) + q(x, t) · Du = µ(x, t)u.

(17)

7

It is natural to expect the tail of u to decays exponentially. Thus, since the equation is
spatially periodic, we look for (the tail of) u under the form

u(x, t) = e−λx·eηλ(x, t),

with ηλ positive and l-periodic in x.

(18)

Rewriting this expression as

shows that the speed of u, namely, a function c for which (2) holds, should satisfy

for some C independent of (x, t) ∈ RN × R. Clearly, this can hold true only if the ratio
between maximum and minimum of ηλ(·, t) is bounded uniformly on t. This property follows
from a Harnack-type inequality, Lemma 3.1 below, which is the keystone of our proof and
actually the only step where the periodicity in x really plays a role. It would be then natural
to deﬁne c(t) := 1
dt lnkηλ(·, t)kL∞(R). The problem is that we do not know if this function is
λ
bounded, since it is not clear whether ∂tηλ ∈ L∞(RN +1) or not. We overcome this diﬃculty
by showing that there exists a Lipschitz continuous function Sλ such that

≤ β.
We deduce that the function c deﬁned (almost everywhere) by c := S′
λ is bounded and it is an
admissible speed for the wave u. The method described above provides, for any given λ > 0,
a wave with speed c = cλ for the linearized equation which decays with exponential rate λ.
It is known -for instance in the case of constant coeﬃcients- that only decaying rates which
are “not too fast” are admissible for waves of the nonlinear reaction-diﬀusion equation. In
Section 3.3, we identify a threshold rate λ∗. In the following section we construct generalized
transition waves for any λ < λ∗, recovering with the least mean of their speeds the whole
interval (⌊cλ∗⌋ , +∞). We do not know if the critical speed c∗ := ⌊cλ∗⌋ is optimal, nor if
an optimal speed does exist. However, we show below that this is the case if one applies
the above procedure to some particular classes of heterogeneities already investigated in the
literature.

In the case where the coeﬃcients are periodic in time too, the class of admissible
speeds has been characterized by the ﬁrst author in [16] (see also [6]). Following the
method described above, we see that an entire solution of (17) in the form (18) is given

by ηλ(x, t) = ek(λ)tϕλ(x, t), where (cid:0)k(λ), ϕλ(cid:1) are the principal eigenelements of the problem2

∂tϕλ − Tr(AD2ϕλ) + (q + 2λAe)Dϕλ − (µ + λ2eAe + λq · e)ϕλ + k(λ)ϕλ = 0 in RN × R,
ϕλ > 0,
ϕλ is periodic in t and x.


2 The properties of these eigenelements, which are unique (up to a multiplicative constant in the case of

(20)

ϕλ) are described in [16] for instance.

8

Actually, the uniqueness up to a multiplicative constant of solutions of (17) in the form (18),
provided by Lemma 3.1 (proved without assuming the time-periodicity), implies that ηλ has
necessarily this form. Thus, Sλ(t) := k(λ)
λ t satisﬁes (19), whence the speed of the wave for the
linearized equation with decaying rate λ is cλ ≡ k(λ)/λ. Since the cλ are constant (and then
they have uniform mean), it turns out that the threshold λ∗ we obtain for the decaying rates
coincides with the minimum point of λ 7→ cλ (see Remark 1 below). We eventually derive
the existence of a generalized transition wave for any speed larger than c∗ := minλ>0 k(λ)/λ,
which is exactly the sharp critical speed for pulsating travelling fronts obtained in [16]. To
sum up, our construction of the minimal speed c∗ is optimal in the space-time periodic
framework. On the other hand, the deﬁnition of c∗ in Section 4 below could also easily be
identiﬁed to this speed and thus Theorem 2.2 implies that there do not exist generalized
transition waves with a speed c such that ⌊c⌋ < minλ>0 k(λ)/λ. We therefore recover also
the non-existence result for pulsating travelling fronts. Only the existence of fronts with
critical speed is not recovered.

In the case investigated by the authors in [18], namely, when A ≡ IN , q ≡ 0 and f does
0 µ(s)ds+λ2t. As a function Sλ we can
λR t
λ lnkηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN ) = 1
0 µ(s)ds + λt, which is Lipschitz continuous. Whence
λ is a speed of a wave with decaying rate λ. In this case the critical decaying

not depend on x, one can easily check that ηλ(t) = eR t
simply take 1
cλ(t) := λ + µ(t)

rate λ∗ is equal to p⌊µ⌋ (see again Remark 1) and thus we have c∗ = 2p⌊µ⌋. This is the

same speed c∗ as in [18], which was proved to be minimal.

Under the assumptions made by Ryzhik and the second author in [23], that is, A and q
only depend on x (periodically) and f only depend on (t, u), the speeds c∗ derived in the
present paper and in [23] coincide, and thus it is minimal, in the sense that there do not
exist any generalized transition wave with a lower speed.

When A ≡ IN and q, f are periodic in x and uniquely ergodic in t, then one can prove
that the same holds true for the function ∂tηλ/ηλ by uniqueness, and thus α ⌊cα⌋ could be
identiﬁed with the Lyapounov exponent λ(α, ξ) used by Shen in [28], where ξ is the direction
of propagation. We thus recover the same speed c∗ as in [28] in this framework, which was
not proved to be minimal since Shen did not investigate the nonexistence of transition waves
with lower speed in [28]. Note that this identiﬁcation is not completely obvious. However, as
the formalism of the present paper and [28] are very diﬀerent, we leave these computations
to the reader.

Lastly, let consider the following example, where one could indeed construct directly the

generalized transition waves:

∂tu − ∂xxu − q(t)∂xu = µ0u(1 − u),

(21)

with q bounded and uniformly continuous and µ0 > 0. This equation satisﬁes assumptions
(3)-(12). The change of variables v(x, t) := u(x −R t
0 q, t) leads to the classical homogeneous
Fisher-KPP equation ∂tv−∂xxv = µ0v(1−v). This equation admits travelling wave solutions
of the form v(x, t) = φc(x − ct), with φc(−∞) = 1 and φc(+∞) = 0, for all c ≥ 2√µ0.
Hence, equation (21) admits generalized transition waves u(x, t) = φc(x − ct +R t
0 q, t) of
speed c − q(t) if and only if c ≥ 2√µ0. That is, the set of least mean of admissible speeds is

9

[2√µ0 − ⌈q⌉ , +∞). Computing c∗ in this case, one easily gets
cλ(t) = λ − q(t) + µ0/λ

ηλ = ηλ(t) = eλ2t−λ R t

0 q(s)ds+µ0t,

and

c∗ = 2√µ0 − ⌈q⌉ .

One could check that c∗ coincides with this value too, meaning that Theorems 2.1 and 2.2
fully characterize the possible least means for admissible speeds, except for the critical one.

3 Existence result

Throughout this section, we ﬁx e ∈ SN −1 and we assume that conditions (3)-(11) hold.
Actually, condition (8) could be weakened by (12), except for the arguments in the very
last part of the proof in Section 3.4. As already mentioned in Section 2.2, these arguments
could be easily adapted to the case where (8) is replaced by (12), leading to transition waves
connecting 0 to the minimal solution with positive inﬁmum.

3.1 Solving the linearized equation

We focus on solutions with prescribed spatial exponential decay.

Lemma 3.1. For all λ > 0, the equation (17) admits a time-global solution of the form (18).
Moreover, ηλ is unique up to a multiplicative constant and satisﬁes, for all t ∈ R, T ≥ 0,

with C > 0 only depending on a constant bounding |λ|, |l|, α−1, α, N and the L∞ norms of
µ and q.

The function (x, t) 7→ e−λx·eηλ(x, t) is a solution of the linearization of (1) near the
unstable equilibrium. We will show in the next section that it is somehow a transition
wave solution of the linearized equation, in the sense that it moves in the direction e with
a certain speed. Due to hypothesis (9), we could use it as a supersolution of the nonlinear
equation. Then, in Section 3.3, in order to construct an appropriate subsolution, we will
need to restrict to exponents λ less than some threshold λ∗. We will eventually derive the
existence of transition waves in Section 3.4.

As mentioned in Section 2.3, Lemma 3.1 is the only point where the spatial periodicity
hypothesis (11) is used. If the coeﬃcients were depending in a general way on both x and t
and if one was able to construct a solution ηλ of equation (25) for which there exists C > 0
such that for all T > 0, (x, t) ∈ RN +1, one has:

1
C kηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN )e−CT ≤ ηλ(x, t + T ) ≤ Ckηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN )eCT ,

(24)

10

then the forthcoming other steps of the proof still apply and it is possible to construct a
generalized transition wave solution of the nonlinear equation (1). We describe this exten-
sion in Section 3.5 below. It would be very useful to determine optimal conditions on the
coeﬃcients enabling the derivation of a global Harnack-type inequality (24) for the linearized
equation. We leave this question as an open problem.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. The problem for ηλ is

∂tηλ = Tr(AD2ηλ) − (q + 2λAe) · Dηλ + (µ + λ2eAe + λq · e)ηλ,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

(25)

We ﬁnd a positive, l-periodic solution to (25) as the locally uniform limit of (a subsequence
of) solutions ηn of the problem in RN × (−n, +∞), with initial datum ηn(−n,·) ≡ mn, where
mn is a positive constant chosen in such a way that, say, supx∈RN ηn(0, x) = 1.
Let us show that any l-periodic solution ηλ to (25) satisﬁes (22) and (23). For given

t0 ∈ R, the function

parabolic comparison principle and derive (22). Let C denote the periodicity cell QN

By parabolic Harnack’s inequality (see, e.g., Corollary 7.42 in [13]), we have that

∀t ∈ R, max

x∈C

ηλ(x, t − 1) ≤ ˜C min

(26)

for some ˜C > 0 depending on a constant bounding |λ|, |l|, α−1, α, N and the L∞ norms of
µ and q, and not on t. On the other hand, the comparison principle yields, for T ≥ 0,
µ(x, s)ds(cid:19) .

from which (23) follows by (22).

It remains to prove the uniqueness result. Assume that (17) admits two positive, l-
periodic in x solutions η1, η2. As shown before, we know that they both satisfy (22) and
(23). We ﬁrst claim that there exists K > 1 such that

∀t ∈ R, x ∈ RN , K −1η2(x, t) ≤ η1(x, t) ≤ Kη2(x, t).

(27)

Let h > 0 be such that η1 ≤ hη2 at t = 0.
for t ≤ 0,
minx∈RN η1(x, t) ≤ h maxx∈RN η2(x, t), because otherwise the parabolic strong maximum

It follows that,

11

principle would imply η1 > hη2 at t = 0. Whence, applying (23) with T = 0 to both η1 and
η2, we ﬁnd a positive constant K such that

∀t < 0, max

x∈RN

η1(x, t) ≤ K min

x∈RN

η2(x, t).

This proves the second inequality in (27), for t < 0, whence for all t ∈ R by the maximum
principle. The ﬁrst inequality, with a possibly larger K, is obtained by exchanging the roles
of η1 and η2. Now, call

k := lim sup
t→−∞

max
x∈RN

η1(x, t)
η2(x, t)

We know from (27) that k ∈ [K −1, K]. Consider a sequence (tn)n∈N such that

tn = −∞,

η1(x, tn)

Deﬁne the sequences of functions (η1

∀i ∈ {1, 2}, n ∈ N,

n(x, t) :=

.

We deduce from (22) and (23) that the (η1
uniformly bounded from below away from 0 in, say, RN×[−2, 2]. The same is true for (η2
by (27). Thus, by parabolic estimates and periodicity in x, the sequences (ηi

Call An := A(·,· + tn), qn := q(·,· + tn), µn := µ(·,· + tn). As A and q are uniformly
continuous, (An)n and (qn)n converge (up to subsequences) to some functions ˜A and ˜q in
loc(RN +1), whereas (µn)n converges to some ˜µ in the L∞(RN +1) weak-⋆ topology. Hence,
L∞
passing to the weak Lp

loc(RN +1) limit in the equations satisﬁed by the (ηi

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

∂t ˜ηi = Tr( ˜AD2 ˜ηi) − (˜q + 2λ ˜Ae)D ˜ηi + (˜µ + λ2e ˜Ae + λ˜q · e)˜ηi,

Clearly, these equations hold almost everywhere because all the terms are measurable func-
tions. That is, the ˜ηi are strong solutions. Moreover,

˜η1 ≤ k ˜η2,

max
x∈RN

˜η1(x, 0)
˜η2(x, 0)

= k.

The strong maximum principle then yields ˜η1 ≡ k ˜η2. As a consequence, for any ε > 0, we
can ﬁnd nε ∈ N such that, for n ≥ nε, (k− ε)η2
n at t = 0. These inequalities
hold for all t ≥ 0, again by the maximum principle. Reverting to the original functions we
obtain (k − ε)η2 < η1 < (k + ε)η2 for t ≥ tn and n ≥ nε, from which, letting n → ∞ and
ε → 0+, we eventually infer that η1 ≡ kη2 for all t ∈ R.

n < (k + ε)η2

n < η1

12

In the particular case T = 0, the inequality (23) reads

min
x∈RN

ηλ(x, t) ≥ C max

x∈RN

ηλ(x, t).

(28)

Notice that, in contrast with standard parabolic Harnack’s inequality, the two sides are
evaluated at the same time. This particular instance of (23) will be sometimes used in the
sequel.

Until the end of the proof of Theorem 2.1, for λ > 0, ηλ stands for the (unique up to a

multiplicative constant) function given by Lemma 3.1.

3.2 The speeds of the waves
Lemma 3.2. There is a uniformly Lipschitz-continuous function Sλ : R → R satisfying (19).
Proof. Properties (22)-(23) yield the existence of a constant β > 0 such that

∀t ∈ R, T ≥ 0,

For all n ∈ N, we deﬁne Sλ on [n, n + 1] as the aﬃne function satisfying

(cid:12)(cid:12) lnkηλ(·, t + T )kL∞(RN ) − lnkηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ β(1 + λ2)T.

Sλ(n) =

Sλ(n + 1) =

λ

lnkηλ(·, n + 1)kL∞(RN ).

Then for all t ∈ (n, n + 1),

Hence, Sλ is uniformly Lipschitz-continuous over R. Moreover, if t ∈ [n, n + 1], one has

Hence, t 7→ Sλ(t) − 1

cλ(t) := S′

λ(t),

(29)

belongs to L∞(R). We will use it as a possible speed for a transition wave to be constructed.

Let us investigate the properties of the least mean of the (cλ)λ>0. It follows from (19)

We have seen in Section 2.3 that, when the coeﬃcients are periodic in t, one can take
Sλ(t) := (k(λ)/λ)t, whence cλ ≡ k(λ)/λ. It follows that λcλ = k(λ), and we know from
the arguments in the proof of Proposition 5.7 part (iii) in [3] that the function k is convex.
In the general heterogeneous framework considered in the present paper, we use the same
arguments as in [3] to derive the Lipschitz continuity of the function λ 7→ λ⌊cλ⌋.
If the
functions cλ admit a uniform mean then these arguments actually imply that λ 7→ λ⌊cλ⌋ is
convex, but we do not know if this is true in general.
Lemma 3.3. The functions λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋ and λ 7→ ⌈cλ⌉ are locally uniformly Lipschitz contin-
uous on (0, +∞).
Proof. Fix Λ > 0 and −Λ ≤ λ0 ≤ Λ. Let λ1 be such that |λ1 − λ0| = 2Λ. For j = 0, 1, the
function vj(x, t) := e−λj x·eηλj (x, t) satisﬁes (17). Hence, setting vj = ewj , we ﬁnd that

For τ ∈ (0, 1), the function w := (1 − τ )w0 + τ w1 satisﬁes, for x ∈ RN , t ∈ R,

∂twj − Tr(cid:0)AD2wj(cid:1) + q · Dwj = µ + Tr(cid:0)ADwj ⊗ Dwj(cid:1),
∂tw − Tr(AD2w) + q · Dw = µ + Tr(cid:16)A(cid:0)(1 − τ )Dw0 ⊗ Dw0 + τ Dw1 ⊗ Dw1(cid:1)(cid:17)

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

≥ µ + Tr(ADw ⊗ Dw).

As a consequence, ew is a supersolution of (17) and then, since

ew(x,t) = e−((1−τ )λ0+τ λ1)x·eη1−τ

λ0 (x, t)ητ

λ1(x, t),

λ0 ητ

the function η1−τ
λ1 is a supersolution of (25) with λ = λτ := (1 − τ )λ0 + τ λ1. We can
therefore apply the comparison principle between this function and ηλτ and derive, for t ∈ R,
T > 0,

kηλτ (·, t)kL∞(RN ) ≤ kη1−τ
kηλτ (·, t + T )kL∞(RN )

λ0 ητ
minx∈RN η1−τ

minx∈RN ηλ1(x, t) (cid:19)τ
≤(cid:18)kηλ0(·, t + T )kL∞(RN )

λ0 ητ

.

Whence, using the inequality (28) for ηλ0 and ηλ1 (with the same C depending on Λ), we
obtain

kηλτ (·, t + T )kL∞(RN )
kηλτ (·, t)kL∞(RN ) ≤ C −1(cid:18)kηλ0(·, t + T )kL∞(RN )

kηλ0(·, t)kL∞(RN ) (cid:19)1−τ(cid:18)kηλ1(·, t + T )kL∞(RN )

Consider the function Γ deﬁned by Γ(λ) := λ⌊cλ⌋. It follows from (30) and (33) that

Γ(λτ ) ≤ lim

If the (cλ)λ>0 admit uniform mean, the above inequality and (30) imply that Γ is convex.
Otherwise, we can only infer that

We have therefore shown that

Γ(λτ ) ≤ (1 − τ )Γ(λ0) + τ λ1⌈cλ1⌉.

∀τ ∈ (0, 1), Γ(λτ ) − Γ(λ0) ≤ τ (λ1⌈cλ1⌉ − λ0⌊cλ0⌋).

Thus, by (31) and (32) there exists a constant K > 0, depending on A, q, µ, such that

∀τ ∈ (0, 1), Γ(λτ ) − Γ(λ0) ≤ K(Λ2 + 1)τ.

This proves the Lipschitz continuity of Γ on [−Λ, Λ], because |λτ − λ0| = 2Λτ , concluding
the proof of the lemma.

The same arguments lead to the local Lipschitz continuity of λ 7→ ⌈cλ⌉.

3.3 Deﬁnition of the critical speed

In order to deﬁne the critical speed c∗, we introduce the following set:

Λ := {λ > 0 : ∃k > 0, ∀0 < k < k, ⌊cλ − cλ+k⌋ > 0}.

(34)

Lemma 3.4. There exists λ∗ > 0 such that Λ = (0, λ∗). Moreover, the function λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋ is
decreasing on Λ.
Proof. Fix λ0, λ1 > 0. For τ ∈ (0, 1), we set λτ := (1 − τ )λ0 + τ λ1. Taking the ln in (33),
and recalling that cλ = S′

λ with Sλ satisfying (19) yields

Whence,

t

Z t+T
λτZ t+T

t

[(1 − τ )λ0cλ0 + τ λ1cλ1 − λτ cλτ ] ≥ ln C − 4λτ β.

(cλ0 − cλτ ) ≥ τ λ1Z t+T

t

(cλ0 − cλ1) + ln C − 4λτ β.

Dividing both sides by T , taking the inf on t ∈ R and then the lim as T → +∞, we derive
(35)

⌊cλ0 − cλτ⌋ ≥ τ

λ1
λτ ⌊cλ0 − cλ1⌋ .

∀τ ∈ (0, 1),
If, instead, we divide by −T , we get
∀τ ∈ (0, 1),

⌊cλτ − cλ0⌋ ≤ τ

λ1
λτ ⌊cλ1 − cλ0⌋ .

(36)

15

Analogous estimates hold of course for the upper mean. The characterization of Λ follows
from these inequalities, by suitable choices of λ0, λ1 and τ . We prove it in four steps.

Step 1. Λ 6= ∅.

The ﬁrst inequality in (31), together with (12), yield

λ→0+ ⌊cλ − c1⌋ ≥ lim
lim

λ→0+ ⌊cλ⌋ − ⌈c1⌉ = +∞.

There exists then 0 < λ < 1 such that ⌊cλ − c1⌋ > 0. Applying (35) with λ0 = λ, λ1 = 1, we
eventually infer that ⌊cλ − cλ+k⌋ > 0, for all 0 < k < 1 − λ, that is, λ ∈ Λ.
By (31) we obtain

Step 2. Λ is bounded from above.

λ→+∞⌊c1 − cλ⌋ ≤ ⌊c1⌋ − lim
lim

λ→+∞⌊cλ⌋ = −∞.

There exists then λ′ > 1 such that, for λ > λ′, ⌊c1 − cλ⌋ < 0. Hence, for k > 0, applying
(36) with λ0 = λ + k, λ1 = 1 and τ = k/(k + λ − 1), we derive

⌊cλ − cλ+k⌋ ≤

k

(k + λ − 1)λ ⌊c1 − cλ+k⌋ < 0.

Namely, λ /∈ Λ and thus Λ is bounded from above by λ′.
Let 0 < λ′ < λ and k > 0. Using ﬁrst (35) and then (36) we get

Step 3. If λ ∈ Λ then (0, λ] ⊂ Λ.
⌊cλ′ − cλ′+k⌋ ≥(cid:18)

k + λ − λ′(cid:19)(cid:18) λ + k

k

λ′ + k(cid:19)⌊cλ′ − cλ+k⌋ ≥(cid:18) λ + k

λ′ + k(cid:19) λ

λ′ ⌊cλ − cλ+k⌋ .

Thus, λ ∈ Λ implies λ′ ∈ Λ.
Step 4. sup Λ /∈ Λ.
Let λ∗ := sup Λ and k > 0. For all n ∈ N, there exists 0 < kn < 1/n such that
(cid:4)cλ∗+1/n − cλ∗+1/n+kn(cid:5) ≤ 0. For n large enough, we have that 1/n + kn < k and then,
by (35),

Whence,

λ∗ + k

k − 1/n(cid:19)(cid:18)

λ∗ + 1/n + kn(cid:19)(cid:4)cλ∗+1/n − cλ∗+k(cid:5) .
0 ≥(cid:4)cλ∗+1/n − cλ∗+1/n+kn(cid:5) ≥(cid:18) kn
⌊cλ∗ − cλ∗+k⌋ ≤(cid:4)cλ∗+1/n − cλ∗+k(cid:5) +(cid:6)cλ∗ − cλ∗+1/n(cid:7) ≤(cid:6)cλ∗ − cλ∗+1/n(cid:7) .

Using the the analogue of (36) for the upper mean, we can control the latter term as follows:

1/n

1/n

(cid:6)cλ∗ − cλ∗+1/n(cid:7) ≤

λ∗ + 2/n(cid:6)cλ∗/2 − cλ∗+1/n(cid:7) ≤

λ∗ + 2/n(cid:0)(cid:6)cλ∗/2(cid:7) −(cid:4)cλ∗+1/n(cid:5)(cid:1) ,

which goes to 0 as n → ∞ (recall that λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋ is continuous by Lemma 3.3). We eventually
infer that ⌊cλ∗ − cλ∗+k⌋ ≤ 0, that is, λ∗ /∈ Λ.
It remains to show that λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋ is decreasing on Λ. Assume by contradiction that
there are 0 < λ1 < λ2 < λ∗ such that ⌊cλ1⌋ ≤ ⌊cλ2⌋. The function λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋, being

16

continuous, attains its minimum on [λ1, λ2] at some λ. Since ⌊cλ1⌋ ≤ ⌊cλ2⌋, we can assume
that λ ∈ [λ1, λ2). The deﬁnition of Λ implies that there exists λ′ ∈ (λ, λ2) such that
⌊cλ − cλ′⌋ > 0. Whence

⌊cλ′⌋ ≤ ⌊cλ⌋ + ⌈cλ′ − cλ⌉ = ⌊cλ⌋ − ⌊cλ − cλ′⌋ < ⌊cλ⌋ .

This is impossible.

We are now in position to deﬁne the critical speed c∗:

c∗ := ⌊cλ∗⌋ ,

(37)

where λ∗ is given in Lemma 3.4.

Remark 1. When the terms in (1) are periodic in time, resuming from Section 2.3, we know
that the speeds (cλ)λ>0 are constant and satisfy cλ ≡ k(λ)/λ, where k(λ) is the principal
eigenvalue of problem (20). Hence,

⌊cλ − cλ+κ⌋ =

k(λ)
λ −

k(λ + κ)

λ + κ

.

As λ 7→ k(λ) is strictly convex (see [16]) and, by (31),

lim

λ→+∞

k(λ)

λ

= +∞,

lim
λ→0+

k(λ) = lim
λ→0+

λcλ ≥(cid:22) min

x∈RN

µ(x,·)(cid:23) > 0,

straightforward convexity arguments yield that λ∗ given by Lemma 3.4 is the unique min-
imizer of λ 7→ k(λ)/λ. Therefore, c∗ = minλ>0 k(λ)/λ, which is known to be the minimal
speed for pulsating travelling fronts (see [16]).

3.4 Construction of a subsolution and conclusion of the proof

In order to prove Theorem 2.1, we introduce a family of functions (ϕλ)λ>0 which play the
role of the spatial periodic principal eigenfunctions in the time-independent case. For λ > 0,
let ηλ be the function given by Lemma 3.1, normalized by kηλ(·, 0)kL∞(RN ) = 1. We deﬁne

ϕλ(x, t) := e−λSλ(t)ηλ(x, t).

By (19) and (28), there exist two positive constants Cλ, β such that

∀x ∈ RN , t ∈ R, Cλ ≤ ϕλ(x, t) ≤ eλβ.

(38)

We will make use of the following key property of the least mean, provided by Lemma 3.2

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Fix γ > c∗. Since the function λ 7→ ⌊cλ⌋ is continuous by Lemma 3.3
and tends to +∞ as λ → 0+ by (31), and Λ = (0, λ∗) by Lemma 3.4, there exists λ ∈ Λ such
that ⌊cλ⌋ = γ. The function w deﬁned by

is a generalized supersolution of (1).

w(x, t) := min(cid:0)e−λx·eηλ(x, t) , 1(cid:1)

In order to construct a subsolution, consider the constant ν in (10). By the deﬁ-
nition of Λ, there exists λ < λ′ < (1 + ν)λ such that ⌊cλ − cλ′⌋ > 0. We then set
ψ(x, t) := eσ(t)−λ′ (x·e−Sλ(t)+Sλ′ (t))ηλ′(x, t) , where σ ∈ W 1,∞(R) will be chosen later. We
have that

∂tψ − Tr(A(x, t)D2ψ) + q(x, t) · Dψ − µ(x, t)ψ = [σ′(t) + λ′(cλ(t) − cλ′(t))] ψ.

Since ⌊λ′(cλ − cλ′)⌋ = λ′ ⌊cλ − cλ′⌋ > 0, by (39) we can choose σ ∈ W 1,∞(R) in such a way
that K := inf R(σ′ + λ′(cλ − cλ′)) > 0. Hence,

∂tψ − Tr(A(x, t)D2ψ) + q(x, t) · Dψ ≥ (µ(x, t) + K)ψ,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

We deﬁne:

v(x, t) := e−λx·eηλ(x, t) − mψ(x, t),
where m is a positive constant to be chosen. By computation,

e−λx·eηλ(x, t) − mψ(x, t) = e−λ(x·e−Sλ(t))(cid:16)ϕλ(x, t) − mϕλ′(x, t)eσ(t)−(λ′ −λ)(x·e−Sλ(t))(cid:17) .

Since ϕλ, ϕλ′ satisfy (38) and σ ∈ L∞(R), it follows that, choosing m large enough, v(x, t) ≤ 0
if x · e − Sλ(t) ≤ 0, and that v is less than δ ∈ (0, 1] from (10) everywhere. If v(x, t) > 0,
and then x · e − Sλ(t) > 0, we see that

∂tv − Tr(A(x, t)D2v) + q(x, t) · Dv − µ(x, t)v ≤ −mKψ

where, for the last inequality, we have used (38) and the fact that λ′ < (1 + ν)λ. As a
consequence, by hypothesis (10), for m suﬃciently large, v is a subsolution of (1) in the set
where it is positive.

Using again (38), one computes:

v(x + Sλ(t)e, t) = e−λx·e(cid:16)ϕλ(x + Sλ(t)e, t) − mϕλ′(x + Sλ(t)e, t)eσ(t)−(λ′ −λ)x·e(cid:17)

≥ e−λx·e(cid:16)Cλ − mCλ′eλ′β+kσk∞−(λ′−λ)x·e(cid:17).

Hence, taking R large enough, one has:

v(x + Sλ(t)e, t) ≥ e−λR(cid:16)Cλ − mCλ′eλ′β+kσk∞−(λ′−λ)R(cid:17) =: ω ∈ (0, 1).

Consequently, the function v deﬁned by

v(x, t) :=(cid:26)

v(x, t)

max(cid:0)ω, v(x, t)(cid:1)

if
if

x · e ≥ Sλ(t) + R,
x · e < Sλ(t) + R,

is continuous and, because of (8), it is a generalized subsolution of (1). Moreover, since
v ≤ w and w(x + Sλ(t)e, t) ≥ e−λRCλ > ω if x · e < R, one sees that v ≤ w. A solution
v ≤ u ≤ w can therefore be obtained as the limit of (a subsequence of) the solutions (un)n∈N
of the problems

(cid:26) ∂tun − Tr(A(x, t)D2un) + q(x, t) · Dun = f (x, t, un),
un(x,−n) = w(x,−n),

x ∈ RN , t > −n

The strong maximum principle yields u > 0. One further sees that

Our aim is to show that ϑ = 1. We know that ϑ ≥ ω > 0, because u(x, t) ≥ v(x, t) ≥ ω if
x · e < Sλ(t) + R. Let (xn)n∈N in RN and (tn)n∈N in R be such that

For n ∈ N, let kn ∈ QN

∂tvn − Tr(A(x, t + tn)D2vn) + q(x, t + tn) · Dvn = f (x, t + tn, vn),

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

By parabolic estimates, one can show using the same types of arguments as in the proof of
Lemma 3.1 that (vn)n∈N converges (up to subsequences) locally uniformly to some function
v satisfying

∂tv − Tr( ˜A(x, t)D2v) + ˜q(x, t) · Dv = g(x, t) ≥ 0,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R,

19

where ˜A and ˜q are the strong limits in L∞
loc(RN×R) of (a
subsequence of) A(x, t + tn), q(x, t + tn) and f (x, t + tn, vn(x, t)) respectively, the inequality
g ≥ 0 coming from hypothesis (8). Furthermore, letting y be the limit of (a converging
subsequence of) (yn)n∈N, we ﬁnd that v(y, 0) = ϑ and

loc(RN +1) and g is the weak limit in Lp

∀x ∈ RN , t ∈ R,

v(x, t) = lim
n→∞

u(x + xn + eZ tn

cλ(s)ds − yn, t + tn) ≥ ϑ.

As a consequence, the strong maximum principle yields v = ϑ in RN ×(−∞, 0]. In particular,
g = 0 in RN × (−∞, 0). Using the Lipschitz continuity of f (x, t,·), we then derive for all
(x, t) ∈ RN × (−∞, 0):
0 = lim

f (x, t + tn, vn(x, t)) = lim

f (x, t, ϑ).

n→+∞

f (x, t + tn, ϑ) ≥ inf

(x,t)∈RN +1

∀T > 0,

This, by (8), implies that either ϑ = 0 or ϑ = 1, whence ϑ = 1 because ϑ ≥ ω > 0.

3.5 A criterion for the existence of generalized transition waves

in space-time general heterogeneous media

As already emphasized above, our proof holds in more general media, without assuming that
the coeﬃcients satisfy (11), that is, without the space periodicity assumption. We then need
to assume that the linearized equation admits a family of solutions satisfying some global
Harnack inequality. We conclude the existence part of the paper by stating such a result.
We omit its proof since one only needs to check that the previous arguments still work.

Theorem 3.5. In addition to (3)-(10), assume that there exists λ > 0 such that for all
λ ∈ (0, λ), there exists a Lipschitz-continuous time-global solution ηλ of

∂tηλ = Tr(AD2ηλ) − (q + 2λAe)Dηλ + (µ + λ2eAe + λq · e)ηλ,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R

satisfying

1
C kηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN )e−CT ≤ ηλ(x, t + T ) ≤ Ckηλ(·, t)kL∞(RN )eCT ,

for some C = C(λ) > 0 and for all T > 0, (x, t) ∈ RN +1.
Then there exists λ∗ ∈ (0, λ) such that for all γ > c∗ := (cid:4)S′
continuous function satisfying (19), there exists a generalized transition wave with speed
cλ = S′
λ such that ⌊cλ⌋ = γ.

λ∗(cid:5), where Sλ is a Lipschitz

4 Non-existence result

Our aim is to ﬁnd bounded subsolutions to the linearized problem

∂tu − T r(cid:0)A(x, t)D2u(cid:1) + q(x, t) · Du = µ(x, t)u,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R,

(40)

20

in order to get a lower bound for the speed of travelling wave solutions. We recall that
no spatial-periodic condition is now assumed. Looking for solutions of (40) in the form
u(x, t) = e−λ(x·e−ct)φ(x, t), with λ and c constant, leads to the equation

(Pλ + cλ)φ = 0,

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R,

(41)

where Pλ is the linear parabolic operator deﬁned by

Pλw := ∂tw − T r(cid:0)A(x, t)D2w(cid:1) +(cid:0)q(x, t) − 2λA(x, t)e(cid:1) · Dw

−(cid:0)λ2eA(x, t)e + λq(x, t) · e + µ(x, t)(cid:1)w.

We consider the generalized principal eigenvalue introduced in [8]:

κ(λ) := infnk ∈ R : ∃ϕ, inf ϕ > 0, sup ϕ < ∞, sup|Dϕ| < ∞, Pλϕ ≤ kϕ, in RN × Ro,

(42)
where the functions ϕ belong to LN +1
loc (RN +1), together with their derivatives ∂t, D, D2 (and
then the diﬀerential inequalities are understood to hold a.e.). This is the minimal regularity
required for the maximum principle to apply, see, e.g. [13].
Taking ϕ ≡ 1 in the above deﬁnition we get, for λ ∈ R,
RN +1 |q||λ| − inf

κ(λ) ≤ −αλ2 + sup

(43)

RN +1

µ.

We now derive a lower bound for κ(λ). Assume by way of contradiction that there exists a
function ϕ as in the deﬁnition of κ(λ), associated with some k satisfying

k < −αλ2 − sup

RN +1 |q||λ| − sup

RN +1

µ.

For β > 0, the function ψ(x, t) := e−βt satisﬁes

Pλψ
ψ ≥ −β − αλ2 − sup

RN +1 |q||λ| − sup

RN +1

µ.

Hence, β can be chosen small enough in such a way that the latter term is larger than k,
that is, Pλψ ≥ kψ. The function ψ is larger than ϕ for t less than some t0, whence ψ ≥ ϕ
for all t by the comparison principle. It follows that ϕ → 0 as t → +∞, which is impossible
since ϕ is bounded from below away from 0. This shows that κ(λ) > −∞.

We can now deﬁne c∗ by setting

c∗ := − max

λ>0

κ(λ)

λ

.

(44)

This deﬁnition is well posed if κ(0) < 0 because κ(λ)/λ → −∞ as λ → +∞ by (43), and we
know from [8] that λ 7→ κ(λ) is Lipschitz-continuous 3. Let us show that (12) implies that

3 The coeﬃcients are assumed to be H¨older continuous in [8], but one can check that it does not matter

in the proof of the continuity.

21

κ(0) < 0 and then that c∗ is well deﬁned and ﬁnite. Writing a positive function ϕ in the
form ϕ(t) := e−σ(t), we see that

µ(x, t)(cid:19) ϕ.
Thus, (39) implies that, for given ε > 0, there exists σ ∈ W 1,∞(R) such that

P0ϕ = −(σ′(t) + µ(x, t))ϕ ≤ −(cid:18)σ′(t) + inf

x∈R

P0ϕ ≤ −(cid:18)(cid:22) inf

x∈RN

µ(x,·)(cid:23) − ε(cid:19) ϕ.

Therefore, if (12) holds, taking ε < ⌊minx∈RN µ(x,·)⌋ we derive κ(0) < 0.
The proof of Theorem 2.2 proceeds in two steps. In the following section we show that
the average between 0 and +∞ of the speed of a wave cannot be smaller than c∗. More
precisely, we derive

Proposition 4.1. Assume that (3)-(6) hold and that κ(0) < 0. Then, for any nonnegative
supersolution u of (1) such that there is c ∈ L∞(R) satisfying (2), there holds

.

In this statement, the notion of (sub, super) solution is understood as in the deﬁnition of
κ(λ): u, ∂tu, Du, D2u ∈ LN +1
loc (RN +1). Notice that the least mean of a function is in general
smaller than the average between 0 and +∞.
In the last section, we establish a general
property of the least mean that allows us to deduce Theorem 2.2 by applying Proposition
4.1 to suitable time translations of the original problem.

4.1 Lower bound on the mean speed for positive times

We start with constructing subsolutions with a slightly varying exponential behaviour as
x · e → ±∞. These will be then used to build a generalized subsolution with an arbitrary
modulation of the exponential behaviour. The term “generalized subsolution” refers to a
function that, in a neighbourhood of each point, is obtained as the supremum of some family
of subsolutions. Then, using the fact that the generalized subsolutions satisfy the maximum
principle, we will be able to prove Proposition 4.1.

Lemma 4.2. Let c, λ ∈ R be such that κ(λ) + cλ < 0. There exists then ε > 0 and M > 1
such that, for any z ∈ R, (40) admits a subsolution v satisfying

if x · e − ct ≥ z,

1
M

e−(λ+ε)(x·e−ct) ≤ v(x, t) ≤ Me−(λ+ε)(x·e−ct),
inf

v(x, t) > 0,

if x · e − ct ≤ z − 1,

1
M

e−(λ−ε)(x·e−ct) ≤ v(x, t) ≤ Me−(λ−ε)(x·e−ct).

22

Proof. By the deﬁnition of κ(λ), there is a bounded function ϕ with positive inﬁmum satis-
fying

Pλϕ ≤ kϕ,

x ∈ RN , t > T,

for some k < −cλ. It follows that v(x, t) := e−λ(x·e−ct)ϕ(x, t) is a subsolution of (40). Fix
z ∈ R and consider a smooth function ζ : R → R satisfying

ζ = λ − ε in (−∞, z − 1],

ζ = λ + ε in [z, +∞),

0 ≤ ζ ′ ≤ 3ε,

|ζ ′′| ≤ hε,

where ε > 0 has to be chosen and h is a universal constant. We deﬁne the function v by
setting v(x, t) := e−(x·e−ct)ζ(x·e−ct)ϕ(x, t). Calling ρ := x · e − ct, we ﬁnd that

[∂tv − aij(x, t)∂ijv + qi(x, t)∂iv − µ(x, t)v]eρ ≤(Pζ + cζ)ϕ

+ C[(1 + ρ + ρ|ζ| + ρ2|ζ ′|)|ζ ′| + ρ|ζ ′′|],

where ζ, ζ ′, ζ ′′ are evaluated at ρ and C is a constant depending on N, c and the L∞ norms
of aij, q, µ, ϕ, Dϕ. The second term of the above right-hand side is bounded by H(ε), for
some continuous function H vanishing at 0. The ﬁrst term satisﬁes

(Pζ + cζ)ϕ ≤ (Pλ + cλ)ϕ + C((ζ − λ) + |ζ 2 − λ2|) ≤ (k + cλ)ϕ + C(ε + 2|λ|ε + ε2).

We thus derive

∂tv − aij(x, t)∂ijv + qi(x, t)∂iv − µ(x, t)v ≤ eρ[(k + cλ)ϕ + Cε(1 + 2|λ| + ε2) + H(ε)].

Since k < −cλ and inf ϕ > 0, ε can be chosen small enough in such a way that v is a
subsolution of (40).
Lemma 4.3. Let λ, λ, c ∈ R satisfy λ < λ and

max
λ∈[λ,λ]

(κ(λ) + cλ) < 0.

Then there exists a generalized, bounded subsolution v of (40) satisfying

lim
r→−∞

sup

v(x, t)eλ(x·e−ct) = 0,

x·e−ct<r

lim
r→+∞

sup

v(x, t)eλ(x·e−ct) = 0.

x·e−ct>r

∀r1 < r2,

inf

r1<x·e−ct<r2

v(x, t) > 0.

(45)

Proof. For λ ∈ [λ, λ], let ελ, Mλ be the constants given by Lemma 4.2 associated with c and
λ. Call Iλ the interval (λ− ελ, λ + ελ). The family (Iλ)λ≤λ≤λ is an open covering of [λ, λ]. Let
(Iλi)i=1,...,n be a ﬁnite subcovering and set for short εi := ελi, Mi := Mλi. Up to rearranging
the indices and extracting another subcovering if need be, we can assume that

∀i = 1, . . . , n − 1,

λi+1 − εi+1 < λi − εi < λi+1 + εi+1 < λi + εi.

Let v1 be the subsolution of (40) given by Lemma 4.2 associated with λ = λ1 and z = 0. Set
z1 := 0, k1 := 1 and

M1M2

23

k2 :=

e(λ2+ε2−(λ1−ε1))(z1−1)

.

Consider then the subsolution v2 associated with λ = λ2 and z equal to some value z2 < z1−1
to be chosen. We have that

if x · e − ct = z1 − 1,

v1(x, t)
v2(x, t) ≥

if x · e − ct = z2,

k1v1(x, t)
k2v2(x, t) ≤ (M1M2)2e(λ2+ε2−(λ1−ε1))(z2−z1+1).

Since λ2 + ε2 > λ1 − ε1, we can choose z2 in such a way that the latter term is
less than 1. By a recursive argument, we ﬁnd some constants (zi)i=1,...,n satisfying
zn < zn−1 − 1 < · · · < z1 − 1 = −1, such that the family of subsolutions (vi)i=1,...,n given by
Lemma 4.2 associated with the (λi)i=1,...,n and (zi)i=1,...,n satisﬁes, for some positive (ki)i=1,...,n,

∀i = 1, . . . , n− 1,
The function v, deﬁned by

if x · e − ct < zn,

is a generalized subsolution of (40) satisfying the desired properties.

Proof of Proposition 4.1. Let u, c be as in the statement of the proposition, and call
0 c(s)ds, t). Since φ(x, t) → 1 as x · e → −∞, uniformly with respect to

φ(x, t) := u(x + eR t
t ∈ R, one can ﬁnd ρ ∈ R such that

φ(x, t) > 0.

We make now use of Lemma 3.1 in [23], which, under the above condition, establishes a lower
bound for the exponential decay of an entire supersolution φ of a linear parabolic equation
(notice that the diﬀerential inequality for φ can be written in linear form with a bounded
zero order term: f (x, t, φ) = [f (x, t, φ)/φ]φ). The result of [23] implies the existence of a
positive constant λ0 such that

φ(x, t)eλ0x·e > 0.

t∈R

By the deﬁnition of c∗, the hypotheses of Lemma 4.3 are fulﬁlled with λ = 0, λ = λ0 and
c = c∗ − ε, for any given ε > 0. This is also true if one penalizes the nonlinear term f (x, t, u)
by subtracting δu, with δ small enough, since this just raises the principal eigenvalues κ(λ)
by δ. Therefore, Lemma 4.3 provides a function v such that, for h > 0 small enough, hv
is a subsolution of (1). We choose h in such a way that, together with the above property,
hv(x, 0) < u(x, 0). This can be done, due to the lower bounds of u(x, 0) = φ(x, 0), because v
is bounded and decays faster than e−λ0x·e as x· e → +∞. Applying the parabolic comparison

24

principle we eventually infer that hv < u for all x ∈ RN , t ≥ 0. It follows that u satisﬁes
(45) with c = c∗ − ε for t > 0. We derive, in particular,
u(cid:16)h(c∗ − ε)t −Z t

which, in virtue of the second condition in (2), implies that

This concludes the proof due to the arbitrariness of ε.

4.2 Property of the least mean and proof of Theorem 2.2

Roughly speaking, the least mean of a function is the inﬁmum of its averages in suﬃciently
large intervals. We show that, in some sense, this inﬁmum is achieved up to replacing the
function with an element of its ω-limit set. The ω-limit (in the L∞ weak-⋆ topology) of a
function g, denoted by ωg, is the set of functions obtained as L∞ weak-⋆ limits of translations
of g.
Proposition 4.4. Let g ∈ L∞(R) and let ωg denote its ω-limit set (in the L∞ weak-⋆
topology). Then

⌊g⌋ = min

˜g∈ωg(cid:18) lim

t→+∞

˜g(s) ds(cid:19) .

Proof. We can assume without loss of generality that ⌊g⌋ = 0. Clearly, any ˜g ∈ ωg satisﬁes
⌊˜g⌋ ≥ ⌊g⌋, whence

lim inf
t→+∞

˜g(s) ds ≥ ⌊˜g⌋ ≥ ⌊g⌋ = 0.

Our aim is to ﬁnd a function ˜g ∈ ωg satisfying
t Z t

˜g(s) ds ≤ 0.
We claim that, for any n ∈ N, there exists tn ∈ N such that

g(s) ds ≤ j.

Assume by way of contradiction that this property fails for some n ∈ N. By the deﬁnition

K Z τ +Kn
On the other hand, there is j ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that nR τ +j
h ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that nR τ +j+h
g(s) ds > h, hence nR τ +j+h

g(s) ds <

A contradiction follows taking K > 2nkgkL∞(R). The claim is proved. The L∞ weak-⋆ limit

∀j ∈ N,

Z j

˜g(s) ds = lim

The deﬁnition of ωc gives a sequence (tn)n∈N in R such that c(· + tn) ⇀ ˜c as n → +∞ for
the L∞ weak-⋆ topology. For n ∈ N, consider the functions

c(s)ds, t + tn(cid:17),

un(x, t) := u(cid:16)x + eZ tn

c(s)ds, t + tn(cid:17),

∀(x, t) ∈ RN +1, u ∈ [0, 1],

f (x, t, u) ≥ (µ(x, t) − ε)u(m − u).

It follows that the un satisfy

∂tun − Tr(An(x, t)D2un) + qn(x, t)Dun ≥ (µn(x, t) − ε)un(m − un),

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

On the other hand, the Lp parabolic interior estimates ensure that the sequences (∂tun)n∈N,
(Dun)n∈N, (D2un)n∈N are bounded in Lp(Q) for all p ∈ (1,∞) and Q ⋐ RN +1. Hence, by
the embedding theorem, (un)n∈N converges (up to subsequences) locally uniformly in RN +1
to some function ˜u, and the derivatives ∂t, D, D2 of the (un)n∈N weakly converge to those
loc(RN +1). Therefore, letting ˜A, ˜q be the locally uniform limits of (subsequences of)
of ˜u in Lp
(An)n∈N, (qn)n∈N and ˜µ be the L∞ weak-⋆ limit of (a subsequence of) (µn)n∈N, we infer that

∂t ˜u − Tr( ˜A(x, t)D2˜u) + ˜q(x, t)D˜u ≥ (˜µ(x, t) − ε)˜u(m − ˜u),

x ∈ RN , t ∈ R.

Hence, ˜u is a supersolution of an equation of the type (1) whose terms satisfy (3)-(5) and
(6). Moreover, it is easily derived from the deﬁnition of the speed c and the L∞ weak-⋆
convergence to ˜c, that ˜u satisﬁes (2) with c replaced by ˜c, uniformly with respect to t ∈ R.

In order to apply Proposition 4.1 to the function ˜u, we need to show that ˜κ(0) < 0, where
λ 7→ ˜κ(λ) is deﬁned like λ 7→ κ(λ), but with ˜A, ˜q, ˜µ − ε in place of A, q, µ respectively.
Namely, the κ(λ) are the principal eigenvalues in the sense of (42) for the operators ˜Pλ
deﬁned as follows:

˜Pλw := ∂tw − T r(cid:0) ˜A(x, t)D2w(cid:1) +(cid:0)˜q(x, t) − 2λ ˜A(x, t)e(cid:1) · Dw

−(cid:0)λ2e ˜A(x, t)e + λ˜q(x, t) · e + ˜µ(x, t) − ε(cid:1)w.

This will be achieved by showing that

whence ˜κ(0) < 0 as soon as ε < −κ(0) (recall that κ(0) < 0 by (12)). Let us postpone for a
moment the proof of (48). Applying Proposition 4.1 to ˜u yields

∀λ > 0,

˜κ(λ) ≤ κ(λ) + ε,

from which ⌊c⌋ ≥ c∗ follows by the arbitrariness of ε.
It remains to prove (48). Let k > κ(λ). By deﬁnition (43) there exists ϕ such that
inf ϕ > 0, ϕ, Dϕ ∈ L∞(RN × R) and Pλϕ ≤ kϕ in RN × R. We would like to perform
on ϕ the same limit of translations as done before to obtain ˜u from u. This would yield
a function ˜ϕ satisfying ˜Pλ ˜ϕ ≤ (k + ε) ˜ϕ. But this argument requires the Lp
loc estimates of
the derivatives ∂t, D, D2 of the translated of ϕ, which are not available because ϕ is a
subsolution and not a solution of an equation. However, it is possible to replace ϕ with a
solution of a semilinear equation of the type Pλw = g(w) in RN × R, with g smooth and
such that g(w) ≤ (k + ε)w, which satisﬁes the same properties as ϕ, as well as the desired
additional regularity properties. This is done in the proof of Theorem A.1 of [23], whose
arguments can be exactly repeated here. We can therefore apply the translation argument
that provides a function ˜ϕ such that ˜Pλ ˜ϕ ≤ (k + ε) ˜ϕ. Moreover, inf ˜ϕ > 0 and sup ˜ϕ < ∞.
In order to be able to use ˜ϕ in the deﬁnition of ˜κ(λ) and derive ˜κ(λ) ≤ k + ε, we only need to
have that sup|D ˜ϕ| < ∞. This property does not follow automatically from the Lp estimates
and the embedding theorem as in the elliptic case treated in [23]. This is the reason why we
need the extra assumption (13) on A. Indeed, we use Theorem 1.4 of [22], with, using the
same notations as in [22], F the nonlinear operator associated with equation Pλw = g(w),
Hypothesis 1.2 of [22] being satisﬁed since A satisﬁes (13), q is bounded and f = f (x, t, u) is
bounded with respect to (x, t, u) ∈ RN × R × [0, 1], and Hypothesis 1.3 being satisﬁed with
ϕ(x, t) := eM t(1 + |x|2) and M large enough. Hence, we get a uniform L∞ bound on Dw,
where w is the solution of Pλw = g(w). Using w instead of ϕ, we get that this bound is
inherited by ˜ϕ and we therefore deduce ˜κ(λ) ≤ k + ε. As k > κ(λ) is arbitrary, we eventually
get (48).
