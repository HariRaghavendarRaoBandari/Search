Cosmic rays are the highest energy particles found in nature. Measurements of the mass

composition of cosmic rays between 1017 eV and 1018 eV are essential to understand whether

this energy range is dominated by Galactic or extragalactic sources. It has also been proposed

that the astrophysical neutrino signal1 comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic

rays of these energies2. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air showers) in

the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of the atmospheric depth

of the shower maximum, Xmax

3, or the composition of shower particles reaching the ground4.

Current measurements5 suffer from either low precision, or a low duty cycle and a high en-

ergy threshold. Radio detection of cosmic rays6–8 is a rapidly developing technique9, suitable

for determination of Xmax

10,11 with a duty cycle of in principle nearly 100%. The radiation

is generated by the separation of relativistic charged particles in the geomagnetic ﬁeld and a

negative charge excess in the shower front6,12. Here we report radio measurements of Xmax
with a mean precision of 16 g/cm2 between 1017 − 1017.5 eV. Because of the high resolution in

Xmax we can determine the mass spectrum and ﬁnd a mixed composition, containing a light
mass fraction of ∼ 80%. Unless the extragalactic component becomes signiﬁcant already be-

low 1017.5 eV, our measurements indicate an additional Galactic component dominating at

this energy range.

Observations were made with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR13), a radio telescope con-

sisting of thousands of crossed dipoles, with built-in air shower detection capability14. LOFAR

records the radio signals from air showers continuously while running astronomical observations

simultaneously. It comprises a scintillator array (LORA), that triggers the readout of buffers, stor-

5

ing the full waveforms received by all antennas.

We have selected air showers from the period June 2011 - January 2015 with radio pulses
in at least 192 antennas. The total uptime was ∼150 days, limited by construction and commis-

sioning of the telescope. Showers that occurred within an hour from lightning activity, or have a

polarisation pattern that is indicative of inﬂuences from atmospheric electric ﬁelds are excluded

from the sample15.

Radio intensity patterns from air showers are asymmetric due to the interference between ge-

omagnetic and charge excess radiation. They can be reproduced from ﬁrst principles by summing

the radio contributions of all electrons and positrons in the shower. We use the radio simulation

code CoREAS16, a plug-in of CORSIKA17, which follows this approach.

It has been shown that Xmax can be accurately reconstructed from densely sampled radio

measurements18. We use a hybrid approach, simultaneously ﬁtting the radio and particle data. The

radio component is very sensitive to Xmax, while the particle component is used for the energy

measurement.

The ﬁt contains four free parameters: the shower core position (x,y), and scaling factors

for the particle density fp and the radio power fr.

If fp deviates signiﬁcantly from unity, the

reconstructed energy does not match the simulation and a new set of simulations is produced. This

procedure is repeated until the energies agree within uncertainties. The ratio between fr and fp

should be the same for all showers and is used to derive the energy resolution of 32% (see Figure

6

1).

The radio intensity ﬁts have reduced χ2-values ranging from 0.9 to 2.9. All features in

the data are well reproduced by the simulation (see Extended Data Figs. 1-5), demonstrating that

the radiation mechanism is now well-understood. The reduced χ2-values exceeding unity may

indicate remaining uncertainties in the antenna response, atmospheric properties, or limitations of

the simulation software.

Radio detection becomes more efﬁcient for higher-altitude showers that have larger foot-

prints. The particle trigger, however, becomes less efﬁcient since the number of particles reaching

the ground decreases. To avoid a bias, we require that all the simulations produced for a shower

pass the trigger criteria. Above 1017 eV this cut removes 4 showers from the sample. At lower

energies, this number rapidly increases, and we exclude all showers below 1017 eV from this anal-

ysis.

Furthermore, we evaluate the reconstructed core positions of all simulated showers. Showers

with a mean reconstruction error above 5 m are rejected. This cut does not introduce a composition

bias, because it is based on the sets of simulated showers, and not on the data. The ﬁnal event

sample contains 118 showers.

The uncertainty on Xmax is determined independently for all showers18, and has a mean value

of 16 g/cm2 (see Extended Data Figure 6). Figure 2 shows our measurements of the average

Xmax, which are consistent with earlier experiments using different methods. The high resolution

7

for Xmax per shower allows us to derive more information on the composition of cosmic rays, by

studying the complete shape of the Xmax distribution. For each shower, we calculate:

a =

(cid:104)Xproton(cid:105)− Xshower
(cid:104)Xproton(cid:105)−(cid:104)Xiron(cid:105)

(1)

where Xshower is the reconstructed Xmax, and (cid:104)Xproton(cid:105) and (cid:104)Xiron(cid:105) are mean values predicted by the

hadronic interaction code QGSJETII.0419.

The cumulative probability density function (CDF) for all showers is plotted in Fig. 3. First,

we ﬁt a 2-component model of proton and iron nuclei, with the mixing ratio as the only free

parameter. To calculate the corresponding CDFs we use a parametrisation of the Xmax distribution

ﬁtted to simulations based on QGSJETII.04. The best ﬁt is found for a proton fraction of 62%, but
it describes the data poorly with a p-value of 1.1× 10−6.

A better ﬁt is achieved with a four-component model (p+He+N+Fe), yielding a p-value of

0.17. While the best ﬁt is found for a Helium fraction of 80%, the ﬁt quality deteriorates only

slowly when replacing helium by protons. This is demonstrated in Figure 4 where the p-value is

plotted for four-component ﬁts where the fractions of helium and proton are ﬁxed, and the ratio

between N and Fe is left as the only free parameter. The total fraction of light elements (p+He) is in

the range [0.38,0.98] at 99% conﬁdence level, with a best ﬁt value of 0.8. The heaviest composition

that is allowed within systematic uncertainties still has a best ﬁt p+He fraction of 0.6, and a 99%

conﬁdence level interval of [0.18, 0.82]. The online method section contains information about the

systematic uncertainties and the statistical analysis.

8

The abundances of individual elements depend on the hadronic interaction model. The Xmax

values predicted by EPOS-LHC20 are on average 15-20 g/cm2 higher than QGSJETII.04 (see

Fig. 2). This coincides with the separation between, for example, protons and deuterium or be-

tween helium and beryllium. We therefore prefer to present our result as a total fraction of light

elements, instead of placing too much emphasis on individual elements.

Recent results for the Pierre Auger Observatory indicate that the cosmic ray composition at

1018 eV, just below the ankle, can be ﬁtted with a mixture of protons and either helium (QGSJET.II04)

or nitrogen (EPOS-LHC)3. With decreasing energy, their proton fraction drops, while their helium
(or nitrogen) fraction rises, down to the threshold energy of 7· 1017 eV. An extrapolation of this
trend to our mean energy of 3· 1017 eV connects smoothly to our best ﬁtting solution in which

helium dominates.

KASCADE-Grande has reported an ankle-like feature at 1017.1 eV, where the spectral index
for light elements changes to γ = −2.79±0.084. However, they ﬁnd a light particle (p+He) fraction
below 30% at 3× 1017 eV (based on their Figure 4), considerably lower than our value. In con-

trast to LOFAR and Auger, their composition measurements are based on the muon/electron ratio.

Auger has reported a muon excess compared to all commonly used hadronic interaction models21.
Inaccurate predictions of muon production, or (cid:104)Xmax(cid:105), can be the cause of the discrepancy in the

fraction of light particles between LOFAR and KASCADE-Grande.

If the knee in the all-particle spectrum near 3× 1015 eV corresponds to the proton or helium

cut-off of the main Galactic cosmic-ray population, the corresponding iron cut-off would lie at most

9

at an energy 26 times larger. If this population still dominates at 1017 eV, the mass composition

should be dominated by heavy elements at that energy. Therefore, the large component of light

elements observed with LOFAR must have another origin.

In principle, it is possible that we observe an extragalactic component. In that case the ankle

in the cosmic-ray spectrum, slightly above 1018 eV, does not indicate the transition from Galactic

to extragalactic origin. Instead, it can be explained as the imprint of pair production on the cosmic

microwave background on an extragalactic proton spectrum22. However, since this feature only

appears for a proton-dominated ﬂux it is in tension with our data that favours a mixture of light

elements.

A second Galactic component, dominating around 1017 eV, can be produced by a class of

extremely energetic sources (Galactic exatrons), like the explosions of Wolf Rayet stars into their

stellar winds23, or past Galactic gamma-ray bursts24. Alternatively, the original Galactic population

could be reaccelerated by the Galactic wind termination shock25. Such scenarios predict mixtures

of light elements, consistent with our results.

Event selection Cosmic ray detection at LOFAR continuously runs in the background during

astronomical observations. When 16 out of the 20 scintillator stations of the LORA particle array
detect a signal, a trigger is issued and the ring buffers of all active antennas within a ∼ 1 km

radius are stored for ofﬂine analysis14. Which antennas are active depends on the settings of the

astronomical observation. For this analysis we have selected showers that were measured with at

least 4 antenna stations (corresponding to at least 192 antennas) in the low band (30 - 80 MHz after

ﬁltering)

The trigger and selection criteria introduce a composition bias. This bias is removed with a

cut based on dedicated sets of simulations that are produced for each observed shower. These sets

contain 50 proton and 25 iron showers, that span the whole range of possible shower depths. A

shower is only accepted when all simulations in its set pass the triggering and selection criteria.

This anti-bias cut removes many showers below 1017 eV, but only 4 above that energy. In this

analysis, we restrict ourselves to the higher-energy showers and impose a cut on energy Ereco >

1017 eV.

The energy cut itself is another potential source of compositional bias, as the reconstructed

energy might be dependent on the depth of the shower. However, in our reconstruction approach

this effect is very small because energy and Xmax are ﬁtted simultaneously. Extended Data Fig-

ure 7 shows distributions of the ratio between true and reconstructed energy for proton and iron
simulations. The systematic offset between the two particle types is of the order of ∼ 1%.

26

We used data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute to check for lightning

storm conditions during our observations. When lightning strikes have been detected in the North

of the Netherlands within an hour from a detection, the event is ﬂagged and excluded from the

analysis. The presence of electric ﬁelds in the clouds can severely alter the radio emission even in

the absence of lightning discharges30. The polarisation angle of the radio pulse is very sensitive

to the nature of the emission mechanism 15, 31 and is used as an additional veto against strong ﬁeld

conditions.

Finally, a quality cut is imposed on the sample in order to only include showers that have a

core position and arrival direction that allows accurate reconstruction. We use the dedicated sets

of simulations produced for each shower to derive uncertainties on core position, energy and Xmax.

These three values are highly correlated, so a single cut on the core uncertainty of σcore < 5 m is

sufﬁcient.

The quality cut is based on the dedicated sets of simulations. These sets are produced for a

speciﬁc combination of core position and arrival direction. Therefore, the quality cut is effectively

a cut on position and direction, and does not introduce a composition bias.

Furthermore, we stress that there is no cut on the quality of the reconstruction of the actual

data. By applying the cuts described above we obtain a sample of 118 showers that are ﬁtted

to the simulation yielding reduced χ2-values in the range 0.9-2.9. Deviations from unity can be

ascribed to uncertainties in antenna response, atmospheric properties like the index of refraction,

or limitations of the simulation software.

27

Reconstruction The energy and Xmax of the shower are reconstructed with the technique described

in Buitink et al. (2014)18.

Statistical uncertainty The statistical uncertainty on the power measurements of individual an-

tennas include three contributions. First, there is contribution from the background noise which

is a combination of system noise and the Galactic background. Secondly, there is a contribution

from uncertainties in the antenna response model. There can be differences between the responses

of antennas, either because of antenna properties (e.g. cross-talk between nearby antennas), or be-

cause of signal properties (e.g. polarisation). Since these ﬂuctuations are different for each shower

core position and arrival direction, they are essentially random and included as a 10% statistical

uncertainty on the power. A third contribution is due to the error introduced by interpolating the

simulated pulse power. Strictly speaking this is not a measurement uncertainty, but it must be taken

into account when ﬁtting the data to simulation. The interpolation error is of the order of 2.5% of

the maximum power18. The three contributions are added in quadrature and produce the one sigma

error bars shown in Extended Data Figures 1-5.

The statistical uncertainty on Xmax is given by the quadratic sum of the uncertainties due

to reconstruction technique and the atmospheric correction. The former is found by applying our

analysis to simulated events with added Gaussian noise, where the noise level is determined from

the data.

In the CORSIKA simulations the standard US atmosphere model was used. The recon-

structed shower depth is corrected for variations in the atmosphere using data from the Global

28

Data Assimilation System (GDAS) of the NOAA National Climatic Data Center. We follow a

procedure developed by the Pierre Auger collaboration32. This typically leads to adjustments of

the order of 5–20 g/cm2. Remaining uncertainty after correction if of the order of 1 g/cm2

The index of refraction of air is a function of temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity.

Using local weather information the ﬁnal data sample was split in two equal size groups corre-

sponding to conditions with relatively high or low index of refraction. The mean reconstructed
Xmax of these groups deviate from the mean by ±5 g/cm2, and we adopt this value as an additional

statistical uncertainty. Because the refractivity used in simulation corresponds to dry air there is

also an associated systematic error (see below).

The total statistical uncertainty on Xmax is found by adding above factors in quadrature. A

distribution of the uncertainty for the showers in our ﬁnal sample is shown in Extended Data

Figure 6.

The energy resolution is 32% and is found by comparing energy scaling factors of the radio

power and particle density ﬁt (see Figure 1).

Systematic effects The data has been subjected to several tests to ﬁnd the systematic uncertainty

on the reconstructed values for Xmax:

• Zenith angle dependence The ﬁnal data sample is split into two groups of equal size by

selecting showers with a zenith angle below or above 32 degrees. For both groups the mean

29

reconstructed Xmax is calculated, yielding deviations from the mean value of ±8 g/cm2. This

spread is larger than expected from random ﬂuctuations alone and is included as a systematic

uncertainty. The dependence on zenith angle may be related with atmospheric uncertainties

(see below).

• Index of refraction of air As explained above, the index of refraction changes because of

differences in atmospheric conditions. Fluctuations on Xmax due to changing humidity are

of the order of 5 g/cm2 with respect to the mean. However, the index of refraction that was

used in the radio simulations corresponds to dry air, and is a lower bound to the actual value.

Therefore, the real value of Xmax can be higher than the reconstructed value but not lower,

and we adopt an asymmetrical systematic uncertainty of +10 g/cm2.

• Hadronic interaction model Since the reconstruction technique is based on full Monte Carlo

simulations, it is sensitive to the choice of hadronic interaction model that is used. It has

been shown with a comparison between QGSJETII.04, SYBILL 2.1, and EPOS-LHC, that
the uncertainty due to model dependence is ∼ 5 g/cm2. Note that the uncertainty on the

composition due to different models (in other words: on how to interpret the measured Xmax

values) is of course larger.

• Radiation code For this analysis we have used the radiation code CoREAS in which the

contributions of all individual charges to radiation ﬁeld are added together. The advantage

of this microscopic approach is that it is completely model-independent and based on ﬁrst

principles. ZHAireS34 is another microscopic code and gives very similar results35. To cal-

culate the emission CoREAS uses the end-point formalism36, while ZHAireS is based on the

30

ZHS algorithm37. Both formalisms are derived directly from Maxwell’s equations and have

been shown to be equivalent38. The other difference between CoREAS and ZHAires is that

they take the particle distribution from different air shower propagation codes (CORSIKA

and AIRES respectively) that internally use different hadronic interaction models. Since

the radiation formalisms themselves are equivalent, small differences between CoREAS and

ZHAireS are most likely due to differences in the hadronic interaction models used to sim-

ulate the particle interactions. The choice of radiation code does therefore not introduce an

additional systematic uncertainty on top of the uncertainty to hadronic interaction models that

is already included. A comparison study with LOFAR data did also not show any evidence

for a systematic offset between the codes and will be published in an upcoming paper.

The remaining small dependence of Xmax on zenith angle is possibly related to the index of refrac-

tion. Showers with different inclination angles have their shower maximum at different altitudes,

and therefore different local air pressure and index of refraction. Therefore, increasing the index

of refraction used in simulations will result in a zenith-dependent change in reconstructed Xmax.

This possibly removes the observed dependence of the composition on zenith angle. Correctly

taking into account a complete atmospheric model for the proﬁle of the refractivity of air is subject

of further study. Here, we treat the effect conservatively by adding the ﬁrst two contributions to

the uncertainty linearly. The other two contribution are independent and are added in quadrature,
yielding a total systematic uncertainty of +14/− 10 g/cm2.

31

The systematic uncertainty on the energy reconstruction with the LORA particle detector

array is 27%, which includes effects due to detector calibration, hadronic interaction models, and

the assumed slope of the primary cosmic-ray spectrum in the CORSIKA simulations33, 39

Statistical analysis For each observed shower, we calculate:

a =

(cid:104)Xproton(cid:105)− Xshower
(cid:104)Xproton(cid:105)−(cid:104)Xiron(cid:105)

(2)

where Xshower is the reconstructed Xmax, and (cid:104)Xproton(cid:105) and (cid:104)Xiron(cid:105) are mean values predicted by

QGSJETII.0419. Thus a is an energy-independent parameter that is mass sensitive. A pure proton

composition would give a wide distribution of a centered around zero, while a pure iron composi-

tion gives a narrower distribution around unity.

From the measurements we construct a cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the fol-

lowing Monte Carlo approach. A realisation of the data is made by taking the measured values

for the energy and Xmax, adding random ﬂuctuations based on the statistical uncertainty of these

parameters, and calculating the a parameters and the corresponding CDF. By constructing a large

number of realisations with different random ﬂuctuation, we can calculate the mean CDF and the

region that contains 99% of all realisations. These are indicated in Figure 3 as the solid blue line

and the shaded region respectively.

We ﬁt theoretical CDFs based on composition with two or four mass components to the data.

The test statistic in the ﬁt is the maximum deviation between the data and the model CDFs. The

p-value is given by the probability of observing this deviation, or a larger one, assuming the ﬁtted

32

composition model.

We ﬁrst use a two-component model of proton and iron nuclei, where the mixing ratio is the

only free parameter. The best ﬁt is found for a proton fraction of 62%, but it describes the data
poorly with a p-value of 1.1× 10−6.

A better ﬁt is achieved with a four-component model (p+He+N+Fe), yielding a p-value of

0.17. While the best ﬁt is found for a Helium fraction of 80%, the ﬁt quality deteriorates only

slowly when replacing helium by protons. This is demonstrated in Figure 4 where the p-value

is plotted for four-component ﬁts where the fractions of helium and proton are ﬁxed, and the

ratio between N and Fe is left as the only free parameter. The solid line in this Figure contains the

parameter space where p > 0.01. We construct a 99% conﬁdence level interval on the total fraction

of light elements (p+He) by ﬁnding the two extreme values of this fraction that still lie within the

p > 0.01 region.

The total fraction of light elements (p+He) is in the range [0.38,0.98] at 99% conﬁdence level,

with a best ﬁt value of 0.8. The heaviest composition that is allowed within systematic uncertainties

(see above) still has a best ﬁt p+He fraction of 0.6, and a 99% conﬁdence level interval of [0.18,

0.82].
