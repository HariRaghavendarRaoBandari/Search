The study of the Brownian motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic ﬁelds ﬁelds
has many important applications in plasma and heavy ions physics, as well as in astrophysics. In
the present paper we consider the electromagnetic radiation properties of a charged non-relativistic
particle in the presence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, of an exterior non-electromagnetic potential,
and of a friction and stochastic force, respectively. We describe the motion of the charged particle
by a Langevin and generalized Langevin type stochastic diﬀerential equation. We investigate in
detail the cases of the Brownian motion with or without memory in a constant electric ﬁeld, in
the presence of an external harmonic potential, and of a constant magnetic ﬁeld. In all cases the
corresponding Langevin equations are solved numerically, and a full description of the spectrum of
the emitted radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is obtained. The Power Spectral
Density (PSD) of the emitted power is also obtained for each case, and, for all considered oscillating
systems, it shows the presence of peaks, corresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.

INTRODUCTION

equation, the Langevin equation [7–11]

The stochastic motion of particles in diﬀerent physi-
cal systems, and under the inﬂuence of various forces,
is a fundamental area of research in plasma physics, as-
tronomy, condensed matter physics, and biology [1, 2].
In particular, the motion and the radiation of charged
particles play a key role in the understanding of the nu-
clear fusion processes in the tokamak plasmas.
In the
presence of an external electric ﬁeld, in a fully ionized
plasma, electrons with energies higher than certain crit-
ical values of the energy are continuously accelerated at
very high-energies. These electrons are called runaway
electrons [3].

The study of runaway electrons, and in particular of
their radiation, represents a ﬁeld of great importance in
diﬀerent areas of research such as astronomy, accelera-
tors, or nuclear fusion.

An important physical problem in plasma and fusion
physics is the anomalous transport in a magnetically con-
ﬁned plasma in a region where the magnetic surfaces are
destroyed [7]. One of the basic methods in the study of
the anomalous transport is based on the analogy between
the transport problem and the random walk or Brownian
motion theory [7, 8]. For this case, the starting point is
the equation of motion of a charged test particle, feeling
the action of a magnetic ﬁeld and of interparticle colli-
sions. The latter are represented by a random force and
the equation of motion becomes a stochastic diﬀerential

dt2 = ~F h~r(t), ˙~r(t), ti + ~η(t),

(1)

where ~F h~r(t), ˙~r(t), ti is the systematic (”average”) force

acting on the article, and ~η(t) is a random force modeling
the eﬀects of the interparticle collisions. The anomalous
transport in plasmas is usually attributed to the magnetic
ﬂuctuations in a very strong ”basic” magnetic ﬁeld ~Bo,
which undergoes small ﬂuctuations in a perpendicular
direction.

The Langevin equation Eq. (1) gives a correct physical
and statistical description of the random Brownian mo-
tion only in the large time limit. This requires that the
considered time intervals must be large enough as com-
pared to the characteristic relaxation time of the velocity
autocorrelation function [11]. The description of the dy-
namics of a homogeneous system without restriction on
a time scale can be realized by generalizing the Langevin
equation. This generalization implies the introduction
of a systematic force term with an integral kernel, which
substitutes the simple friction term [12]. From a physical
point of view the convolution term describes the memory,
or the retardation eﬀects. From an astrophysical point
of view such a term can be used to model the stochastic
oscillations of the accretion disks [13] in the presence of
colored noise [14, 15].

The study of the Brownian motion of charged parti-
cles in magnetic ﬁelds based on the Langevin equations
with the dynamic friction proportional to the particle
velocity was initiated in [16], where the diﬀusion of ions
in plasma across the magnetic ﬁeld, with the stochastic-
ity arising from the ﬂuctuations of the electric ﬁeld was

considered. In this work the mean square displacement
was found in the limit of long times. These studies were
further extended in [17, 18], where it was shown that
for a special symmetry of the dynamical friction matrix
for Larmor periods of the order of the relaxation time
across the magnetic ﬁeld the diﬀusion takes place as an
ordinary Brownian motion, uninﬂuenced by the presence
of the external magnetic ﬁeld. The investigation of the
Brownian motion of charged particles in stochastic mag-
netic ﬁelds via the use of the Langevin and generalized
Langevin equation has become an active ﬁeld of research
with many potential applications in astrophysics, plasma
physics, and condensed matter [19–24]. The electromag-
netic radiation in small-scale random magnetic ﬁelds (jit-
ter radiation) and its spectrum, as well as the supplemen-
tary acceleration produced by the random variations of
the Lorentz force were considered in [25]-[33].

An interesting phenomenon, that was studied recently,
indicates the presence of long-time tails and resonant
peaks, in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium correlation
functions for the velocity of the Brownian particle as de-
scribed by the generalized Langevin equation [34]. In [35–
37] it was pointed out that resonant stochastic behavior
with a single peak and multi-peaks can be found in PSD
curves of the stochastically oscillating accretion disks, de-
scribed by both standard and generalized Langevin equa-
tions.

It is the purpose of the present paper to consider
the electromagnetic radiation of charged, non-relativistic
particles, in stochastic motion under the eﬀect of some
random exterior forces, in the presence of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, of an external non-electromagnetic po-
tential, and interacting with the environment by means
of interparticle collisions, described as a friction force. To
describe the motion of the particle we use the Langevin
equation, describing the non-relativistic motion of a
Brownian particle. Due to the friction force, the par-
ticles in Brownian motion lose energy to the medium,
but simultaneously gain energy from the random kicks of
the external environment, modeled by the random force,
as well as from the external non-electromagnetic, electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. The electromagnetic power emit-
ted by the particles is proportional to the square of its
acceleration, which can be computed directly from the
Langevin equation.

In our study we compute the electromagnetic radiation
for four physical models. The ﬁrst case we investigate is
the Brownian motion of a charged particle in a constant
electric ﬁeld (case I). Therefore the Langevin equation
contain three force terms, the friction force, the electric
force, and an external stochastic force. We obtain the
stochastic power emitted by the particle, as well as the
corresponding power spectral density. As a second case
we consider the Brownian motion of a particle in a har-
monic potential (case II). The emitted electromagnetic
power as well the power spectral density is obtained. For
the case of a charged particle with memory in a har-
monic potential, described by the generalized Langevin

2

equation, we present the displacement, velocity distribu-
tion, the electromagnetic power, and the power spectral
density (case III). Finally, a full analysis of the Brownian
motion of a charged particle in a constant magnetic ﬁeld
is presented (case IV), including the computation of the
electromagnetic emitted power, and of the power spectral
density. In all cases we obtain the total emitted electro-
magnetic power, as well as its statistical properties, from
the numerical solution of the Langevin equation.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Section II
we introduce the Langevin equation describing the mo-
tion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
and in an external, non-electromagnetic potential, and
we present the basic relation for the stochastic power
emitted during the motion. In Section III we consider in
detail the numerical algorithms and the solutions of the
Langevin and generalized Langevin equations describing
the Brownian motion of a charged particle in a constant
electric ﬁeld, in an exterior harmonic potential, and in
a constant magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. We discuss and
conclude our results in Section IV.

II. STOCHASTIC EQUATION OF MOTION OF
CHARGED PARTICLES AND THE NUMERICAL

ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING THE LANGEVIN

EQUATIONS

The equation of motion of a charged particle with mass
m, charge Ze, and velocity ~v in electric ~E(t) and mag-
netic ﬁeld ~B(t) ﬁelds, experiencing damping and random
acceleration is given by [7]-[11]

Ze

= Ze ~E(t)+

d~v
mch~v(t) × ~B(t)i−ν~v(t)+∇V +~η(t), (2)
dt
where ν is an eﬀective collisions frequency, −ν~v(t) is the
damping term, and V is an external potential, corre-
sponding to the presence of non-electromagnetic forces.
Eq. (2) is a stochastic diﬀerential equation, known as
the A-Langevin equation [7]-[10]. Generally, there are
two stochastic functions in the A-Langevin equation: the
stochastic electric and magnetic ﬁelds ~E(t) and ~B(t), and
the random acceleration η(t). To close the system of
equations, the stochastic properties of these functions
should be deﬁned. Generally, one assumes that both
are Gaussian processes, which means that the ﬁrst and
the second order correlation functions provide a complete
statistical description of these functions [7]. However,
in the following we consider the case in which all the
stochastic eﬀects, coming from the electric or magnetic
ﬁelds, or from the random medium, can be encoded in
the stochastic acceleration term η(t). Therefore in the
present analysis we keep only one stochastic term in the
Langevin equations.

For the random acceleration ~η(t) we chose ﬁrst the

white noise approximation, i.e.,

(cid:10)η(t)i(cid:11) = 0,Dη (t1)i η (t2)jE = Aδij δ (t1 − t2) .

(3)

The equilibrium thermal velocity vth is related to the
collisions frequency ν and value A as v2
th = (A/2) ν. This
relation is valid for charged particles in a magnetic ﬁeld
as well, since equilibrium thermal velocity is not aﬀected
by the Lorenz force.

An extension of the Langevin equation Eq.

(2) was
proposed by Kubo [12], with the dynamical friction be-
coming frequency dependent. The generalized Langevin
equation in the presence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds is
given by

where the friction function γ (t − t′) represents now the
retarded eﬀect of the frictional force.
The total electromagnetic power P emitted by a mov-

ing charge is, in the non-relativistic limit [38],

P =

c3 ~a2,

(5)

where ~a = d~v/dt is the acceleration of the particle. By
taking into account that for a charged particle moving
in a magnetic ﬁeld the acceleration is given by Eq. (2),
we obtain for the total electromagnetic power emitted by
the stochastically moving particle the expression

P =

,

(6)

where ~v(t) is obtained as a solution of Eq. (2). If the mo-
tion of the charged particle in stochastic motion can be
described by the generalized Langevin equation Eq. (4),
then the electromagnetic power emitted by the particle
is given by

P =

(7)

An important physical and statistical parameter is the
steady-state mean autocorrelation function of the emit-
ted electromagnetic power by the particle in Brownian
motion, and which is deﬁned as

CP P (cid:0)˜t(cid:1) = lim

t→∞(cid:10)P (t)P (cid:0)t + ˜t(cid:1)(cid:11) .

(8)

The Fourier transform of the mean autocorrelation
function is called the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of
the power.

In the following we will consider the numerical solu-
tions of the Langevin equations Eqs. (2) and (4), re-
spectively [39, 40]. In order to obtain the numerical so-
lutions we introduce a set of dimensionless coordinates

(cid:0)θ, q, V, W, ¯Ω, L(cid:1), where θ represents the dimensionless

time, q the dimensionless displacement, V the dimen-
sionless velocity, W is the dimensionless frequency, ¯Ω is
the dimensionless Larmor frequency, and L is the dimen-
sionless power, respectively.

Due to their deﬁnition (detailed in the following sec-
tions for each case), these dimensionless parameters
quantify the relative inﬂuence of deterministic param-
eters versus the amplitude of the noise in the system.
Results will generally be discussed as a function of these
parameters, thus one should keep in mind that the inﬂu-
ence of the noise amplitude is embedded in them.

The results and discussions of the numerical simula-

tions are grouped into three categories:

1. direct results, which are the dimensionless displace-

ment q(θ) and the velocity V (θ),

2. the luminosity (emitted power) L(θ), representing
an indirect result but which can be at least quali-
tatively directly compared with observations, and

3. statistical characteristics, used to compare between
diﬀerent results and between diﬀerent parame-
ter sets characterizing the physics of the system.
We considered methods and approaches commonly
used by astronomers to analyse observational data
[41, 42]:

(a) the statistical characteristics of the (simu-
lated) light curve; the mean µ provides infor-
mation about the injected energy, the stan-
dard deviation σ provides information about
the dispersion of data with respect to the
mean value, the skewness s is an indicator
of the lack of symmetry of the distribution of
values, with a positive skewness indicating a
distribution with a long right tail, while a neg-
ative skewness indicates a distribution with a
long left tail, and the kurtosis κ measures the
concentration of data around the peak and in
the tails versus the concentration in the ﬂanks,
with a normal distribution having κ = 3;

(b) what is called ﬁrst order statistics, i.e., based
on autocorrelation of the data; we will dis-
cuss the PSD, obtained by taking the Fourier
transform of the ensemble averaged correla-
tion function of L(θ);
in cases where it is
appropriate, we discuss also the possible ap-
pearance of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs)
which we characterize in terms of their quality
factor Q (also sometimes called coherence of
oscillation). Q is deﬁned as the ratio between
the frequency f0 at which the maximum of
the peak occurs and the width of the peak at

4

half-maximum intensity; generally, in astro-
nomical nomenclature, if Q is very large, the
oscillation is stricly periodic, if Q decreases
towards the value 2, the feature represents a
QP O and if Q < 2 the signal is usually la-
belled as noise [42]. There is not one single
number or even set of numbers that can be
used to fully characterize a PSD of a light
curve coming from a source with non-periodic,
non-deterministic behaviour; thus a very im-
portant component of PSD analysis is the vi-
sual inspection of the PSD curve.

According to the central limit theorem, they should both
have Gaussian distributions in the steady state [11]. The
variances of these distributions are independently known,
for the x distribution should obey the diﬀusion law, and
the velocity distribution should be Maxwell-Boltzmann.

Thus we must have (cid:10)x2(cid:11) = 2Dt, and m(cid:10)v2(cid:11) = KBT ,

where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and T the abso-
lute temperature [7, 11]. By calculating these variances
via the Langevin equation, we can relate the parameters
c0 = A/dt and ν to physical properties. Hence we have
c0/2mν = kBT , and ν = kBT /mD [7, 11].

All results are obtained after mediation over 103
stochastic realisations, and all PSDs were computed
starting from a baseline of 103 timesteps.

III. ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION OF

CHARGED PARTICLES IN STOCHASTIC

MOTION

In the present Section we consider the properties of the
electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles
in random media, whose equations of motion are given
by Langevin or generalized Langevin type equations. In
particular, we analyze the total emitted power, and the
power spectrum for charged particles in Brownian mo-
tion in the presence of an electric ﬁeld, in Brownian mo-
tion in the presence of a harmonic potential, for charged
particles obeying a generalized Langevin type equation
with memory, and for the stochastic motion of particles
in constant magnetic ﬁelds.

A. Radiation of a charged particle in Brownian

motion in the presence of an electric ﬁeld

1. Equations and physics

The simplest possible stochastic motion of a charged
particle with Z = 1 and mass m is the one-dimensional
Brownian motion in the presence of an external electric
ﬁeld, ~E 6= 0, in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld ~B = 0. In
the following we restrict or analysis to the case of the con-
stant electric ﬁeld, ~E = constant. The random motion of
the particle is described by the Langevin equation

To treat ξA as a random acceleration we must consider
an ensemble of systems, and deﬁne the random accelera-
tion through its ensemble averages [9],

hξA(t)i = 0,hξA (t1) ξA (t2)i =

A
dt

δ (t1 − t2) .

(10)

Due to the ensemble interpretation, the velocity v and
the position x of the particle are stochastic variables.

2. The energy balance equation

We deﬁne the average kinetic energy of the particle as

EK =

m
2 hv2i.

(11)

Multiplying both sides of the Langevin equation Eq. (9)
by mv we obtain

m
2

d
dt

v2 + mνv2 = mevE + mvξA.

(12)

Taking the average of the above equation we obtain

d
dt

EK = hmvξAi − 2νEK,

(13)

where we have assumed that E = constant, and < v >=
0. In Eq. (13) the term hmvξAi represents the average
work done on the system, while the term −2νEK gives
the rate of the energy dissipation, which, for a charged
particle, is due to the electromagnetic radiation. There-
fore we obtain the relation

hPi =

2
3

e2
c3 ha2i = 2νEK.

(14)

The average work done on the system can be obtained
as hmvξAi = mc0/2, and therefore the energy balance
equation becomes

d
dt

EK =

mc0
2 − 2νEK,

EK(t) =

mc0

4ν (cid:0)1 − e−2νt(cid:1) .

In the limit of large times, limt→∞ EK (t) = mc0/4ν =
constant, and therefore we obtain for the average of the
emitted electromagnetic radiation the expression

hPi =

mc0

= m2νkBT.

3. Numerical approach and simulated light curves

The diﬀerential equations are brought to a dimension-

less form, by the following transformations

;

the collision frequency in Brownian Motion;

• dimensionless time: θ = νt; ν = 1/τ , where ν is
• dimensionless displacement: q = x(cid:0)Aτ 3(cid:1)−1/2
• dimensionless velocity V = v/vT , where vT =
√Aτ ;
• dimensionless acceleration ad =pτ /c0 ≡ dV /dθ;
• dimensionless emitted power ¯P = 3
P ≡ a2
d;
• dimensionless electric ﬁeld ¯E = Eepτ /c0.

The dimensionless equation describing the motion of a

τ c3

2

(Ze)2c0

Brownian particle in a constant electric ﬁeld is

dV (θ)

dθ

= −V (θ) + ¯E + ¯ξA(θ),

(18)

where

(cid:10) ¯ξA(θ)(cid:11) = 0,(cid:10) ¯ξA (θ1) ¯ξA (θ2)(cid:11) =

1
dθ

δ (θ1 − θ2) .

(19)

We shall continue to denote the dimensionless emitted
power by L(θ) and interpret it as the luminosity produced
by a charged particle in Brownian Motion.

To produce the numerical solution for the displace-
ment, velocity and radiation pattern, Eqs. (18)-(19) and

V (θ) =

dq
dθ

;

ad(θ) =

dV
dθ

; L(θ) = a2

d(θ),

(20)

are used, together with a ﬁrst order Euler scheme. The
variables are discretised in the usual manner, the di-
mensionless timestep θ is discretised in units of h, such
that θn = nh, where n is an integer number. Accord-
ingly, all the other variables depending on θ become, e.g.,
V (θ) = V (nh) ≡ Vn.

For example, for the velocity, the discretised equation

Vn+1 − Vn

h

= −Vn + ¯E + ψn

becomes, in update form

Vn+1 = Vn + h(−Vn + ¯E + ψn),

(21)

(22)

where ψn is a number drawn at each timestep from
N (0, h−1), where N (µ, σ2) is a normal distribution of
mean µ and variance σ2.
The initial conditions are q(0) = ad(0) = 0 and
V (0) = V0. For the purpose of studying the case when
one injects a high energetic electron into a distribution
of plasma versus what happens the case when one in-
troduces a thermalized electron, two regimes of initial

5

velocities will be considered: V0 ∼ 103 and V0 ∼ 1 re-
spectively.
To summarize, we obtain numerical solutions for the
variables {q, V, L}, where the parameter space is given
by { ¯E, V0}. For consistency, dθ = h = 0.01 throughout.
The power emitted by a charged particle in stochas-
tic one-dimensional motion in a constant electric ﬁeld is
represented, for two distinct sets of initial conditions, in
Fig. 1; for comparison purposes, also included is
the solution to Eq. 18 without noise (i.e., ¯ξA = 0).
For the motion of a charged particle in a constant elec-
tric ﬁeld, subjected to a friction force proportional to the
velocity, we expect that the amount of radiated energy is
and increasing function of the input energy; the inﬂuence
of the input energy is considered here either by modifying
|E|, or by modifying the initial conditions. The expected
behavior is indeed recovered by our simulations, as can
be seen both in Fig. 1 and by consulting the column 3
of Table I. For the parameter space considered in this
work, it can be seen that adding a noise component is
enough not only to balance loss by friction, but in fact
to dramatically increase the energy output of the system
(Fig. 1). It thus becomes apparent that the energy radi-
ated in this context is due to the energy received by the
electron as random kicks in its Brownian motion. So,
when it comes to mean values of the LC vector, they are
higher than for the noiseless case and it is not as easy
to discriminate between those corresponding to diﬀerent
values of the electric ﬁeld. The random kicks play a very
eﬃcient role in homogenizing the behavior of the charged
particle.

4. Statistical characteristics of results

The statistical characteristics (here and elsewhere in
the paper) are based on a baseline of 103 timesteps, even
if for presentation purposes we show only portions of
the data vector. Table I contains numerical values for
the points in the parameter space covered by our sim-
ulations. These numerical values may be used to dis-
criminate between diﬀerent light curves as follows: it is
noticed that the mean value increases with the value of
the electric ﬁeld (consequence of increasing energy injec-
tion), i.e. both values for E ∈ {−7, 7} are higher than
for E = 1, but the value for which the charge has the
same sign as the applied electric ﬁeld is larger. Also, the
(overall) mean is always higher by approximately 6% for
the explosive initial conditions (ICs) than for the thermal
ICs. However, ICs have a dramatic eﬀect on the disper-
sion, as expected. The standard deviation increases by
300% for the explosive ICs. Also dramatic is the eﬀect
on the skewness and kurtosis, as can be noticed from the
values in the last two columns. Note that for the thermal
case, the skewness and kurtosis have values very close to
their theoretical values for a gaussian process, i.e. 0 and
3 respectively.

the noiseless diﬀerential equation is included. The colors are for diﬀerent values of ¯E ∈ {±7, ±5, 1}, corresponding to e > 0 and
e < 0, respectively. The terms ”thermal” and ”explosive” refer to initial conditions of V0 = 0.1 and V0 = 100 respectively. For
the thermal case with noise, the curves have been multiplied by 10−2 for presentation purposes. For the thermal case without
noise, the lower curve is for ¯E = 1, the next two are for ¯E = ±5 and the following two for ¯E = ±7.

propriateness of studying curves such as the LC for the
explosive case by means of these statistical characteris-
tics. When studying the behavior of systems, one usually
uses data which has been cleaned for the transitory part,
i.e., data produced by the system in equilibrium. This
is unfeasible in astronomy and astrophysics from at least
two points of view: astronomers do not have the luxury
of observing many diﬀerent realisations of an identically
prepared system and some of the most interesting physics
in astrophysics is the one pertaining to the transitory
state. Characteristics such as the skewness and kurto-
sis can clearly oﬀer at least an idea on the nature of the
source.

For the case of a charge moving in a constant electric
ﬁeld while subjected to relatively small Brownian kicks
(recall that ¯E may be interpreted as the ratio between the
inﬂuence of the electric energy with respect to the energy
injected by Brownian motion) the PSDs are generally ﬂat
curves (Fig. 2), reﬂecting the fact that the noise content
is trivial. Also included is the PSD of the noiseless
counterpart. The actual value of the ¯E free parameter
has little importance for both the qualitative and quan-
titative look of the PSD in both initial condition cases.
There is no feature in the PSD which indicates a charac-
teristic frequency nor features that look like QPOs, but
this is what we would expect for this case.

The physical characteristics of the particle motion de-
pends on the sign of the quantity 1−4W 2. If 1−4W 2 < 0,
the particle will oscillate at the natural damped fre-
quency ω = √4W 2 − 1/2.

The same numerical algorithm as in Section III A 3 is
employed, i.e., we discretise the equations and implement
an Euler scheme for the update equations. We obtain
numerical solutions for the variables {q, V, P}, where the
parameter space is given by { W, V0}.
The time variation of the electromagnetic radiation
emitted by a charged particle in stochastic motion in a
harmonic potential is represented in Fig. 3; the noiseless
counterpart is given in Fig. 4.

For the motion of a charged particle, undergoing fric-
tion in an external potential, we would expect that the
light curve is a sinusoidal-like curve, with the amplitude
decreasing in time. This indeed can be seen in Fig. 4.
Naturally, since the friction remains constant, the posi-
tion of the peaks depends on the value of W ; also, the
mean value of the LC is an increasing function of W ,
as more energetic electrons emit more energy when sub-
jected to otherwise identic conditions; this can be seen
in column 3 of Table II. When the noise is turned on
(Fig. 3), the random kicks are very eﬃcient at homo-
geneizing the behavior of the charged particle for the
thermal case: there is little diﬀerence between the LCs
for W 2 varying across 3 orders of magnitude. However,

3. Statistical analysis of results

Table II contains the analysis of the statistical charac-
teristics for the case of a charged Brownian particle, with
friction, in a harmonic potential of dimensionless equiv-
alent frequency W . As expected, the mean value of the
power output increases as W 2 increases and is larger con-
sistently for a larger energy input through the diﬀerent
ICs. In the case of the dispersion, while for the thermal
case the change is of ≈ 3.4% for diﬀerent values of W ,
in the explosive case, the dispersion changes by ≈ 140%
for diﬀerent values of W . The skewness is pronounced
for the thermal case, but rather constant with varying
W . For the explosive case, the skewness is almost zero
for W 2 = 1, but increases by two order of magnitude for
W 2 = 5.

A technical note regarding the reading of the PSD,
namely the clariﬁcation of the meaning of a feature ap-
pearing at log f = x; the calculation of the PSD is based
on taking the correlation between the values of the LC
j timesteps apart. When calculating the associated fre-
quency, one has to take into account that we meshed the
temporal axis in quanta of h = 0.01, such that in fact the
value x in the PSD corresponds to a period T = 102−x.
Conversely, if one expects periodicity with some period
τ = 2π/ω, then the connection between ω and x is given
by x = 2 − log(2π/ω).
Since the motion is periodic, we expect that the PSD
will display well deﬁned peaks at the frequencies cor-
responding to W . This can be seen in Fig. 6;
for
W 2 ∈ (0.01, 10), the quantity log f =∈ (0.2, 1.7). One

can see that the theoretical behavior is indeed recovered
by the simulations. When the noise is turned on, these
general features characterizing the LC are recovered in
the PSD as well. For both IC cases, the power is greater
than for the noiseless case and generally greater for the
explosive conditions; diﬀerent values of W 2 produce clear
signatures in the PSD of the explosive LC. The PSD con-
tains no new feature brought on by noise, but the existing
peaks are widened, as one would expect from the inter-
action with a heath bath.

In the presence of a colored noise, which accounts for
the general memory and retarded eﬀects of the frictional
force, and on the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorems, the
motion of a charged particle in a harmonic potential is
described by the generalized Langevin equation, which in
the one-dimensional case can be written as

the variables
{q, V, P}, where the parameter space is given by { W, V0}
and we set ¯α and ¯C to some ﬁxed values.
The dimensionless displacement and velocities of the
stochastic motion with memory of the charged particle
are presented in Figs. 7 and 8. The electromagnetic
power emitted by the particle is shown in Figs. 9-11; each
of the ﬁgures also includes the noiseless counter-
part.

For the case of a charged particle moving in an exter-
nal potential, while undergoing friction with memory, we
expect LCs with a sinusoidal-like appearance while the
amplitude is decreasing in time; also, the means and pe-
riod depend on the W 2 parameter. When the friction is
constant, we see that for W 2 < 1 the emission is friction
dominated, while for W 2 > 1 the emission is oscillation
dominated. If W 2 is kept ﬁxed and the friction kernel
amplitude ¯α is varied, it is seen (Fig. 11 and Table IV)
that the mean value of the LC is an increasing function of
¯α. This might be a consequence of the fact that a larger
memory kernel means that more energy is stored in the
system.

When the noise is turned on, the overall energy in-
jected, and thus emitted by the charged particle is in-
creased. When W 2 is kept constant, there is a point in
parameter space in which the system switches from fric-
tion dominated to noise dominated, as can be seen in
Fig. 11 right, upper group of LCs.

3. Statistical analysis of results

Tables III and IV contain the analysis of the statis-
tical characteristics for the case of a charged Brownian
particle, with a memory friction kernel, in a harmonic
potential of dimensionless equivalent frequency W . As
for the other cases, the mean value of the emitted power
is larger in the case of explosive conditions, in this case
by two orders of magnitude; it varies, within the same

10

ICs, by approximately 3% for the thermal case and by
approximately 4% for the explosive case. The same com-
ment can be made about the dispersion, The novelty here
is that the skewness and kurtosis vary very little with the
change of ICs; they signiﬁcantly depart from their corre-
sponding Gaussian values.

The very interesting consequence is seen clearer in the
PSD: since for W 2 = 0.0005 the value of log f = −0.44,
than the new feature appearing in the PSD (Fig. 16) is
a signature of the memory existent in the system, due
to the friction kernel. The position of the peak shifts
as ¯α increases, thus as the amplitude of the memory in-
creases, the motion becomes correlated over longer times-
pans. When the noise is turned on, the PSDs for W 2 > 1
(Fig. 13 compared with Fig. 14) are adequate to fully see
the eﬀects of the various inﬂuences present in the system;
for this set of W 2, the value of log f ∈ 1.55, 1.90, which
cannot be seen as such in either of the plots. However,
there is a feature for smaller values of log f , and the po-
sition of this feature moves to the right as W 2 increases.
When W 2 is constant and the friction varies (Fig. 15) the
position of the additional peak stays roughly the same
with respect to the noiseless case, however the height of
the peak becomes larger. We infer that this happens
because, due to the memory of the friction, the system
is not eﬃcient in instant radiation of its energy, and a
correlation appears, overwriting the expected periodicity
and producing a new one.

The equation of motion of a charged particle in a mag-

x + a2

simple calculation for the noiseless case (Eqs. (50)-(51))
shows that the contribution to the LC from the x and
y = e−2θ(1 + ¯Ω2) is obviously not
y directions, a2
periodic. So there is a very clear diﬀerence between the
observational signature of a charged particle moving in
an external harmonic potential (previous two cases) and
that of a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic
ﬁeld.

The motion of a charged particle in a constant mag-
netic ﬁeld while undergoing friction is expected to pro-
duce a light curve with an intensity which is decaying
in time, with mean value depending on the energy in-
jected in the system, through the IC and the value of the
magnetic ﬁeld. This is indeed recovered in Fig. 20 and
column 3 of Table V. When a noise component is turned
on, the energy level is generally enhanced and thus in
this parameter space it seems that the energy radiated
from charged particles generally comes from the random
kicks these particles are subjected to.

3. Statistical analysis of results

Table V contains the analysis of the statistical char-
acteristics for the case of a charged Brownian particle
undergoing friction in a magnetic ﬁeld. Even in the case
of thermal injection, there is a dramatic increase in the
mean power output with little variation of the dimen-
sionless Larmor frequency ¯Ω. In the explored parameter
space, for ﬁxed magnetic energy content, the power out-
put does not signiﬁcantly change even if the emission
occurs following and explosion. This insensitivity on ICs
for ﬁxed ¯Ω can also be seen for the dispersion and for the
kurtosis. The skewness, however, changes sign, although
generally keeping the same absolute value to within a few
percent.

Since, as argued above, no periodicity is expected in

the LC, the PSD for the noiseless case is featureless
(Fig. 22). When the noise is turned on, the PSD is still
generally smooth and the eﬀect of the noise is seen in the
overall increase of power at all frequencies (Fig. 21). The
numerical value of ¯Ω inﬂuences the spectral power, i.e.,
the relative inﬂuence of the power for a ﬁxed frequency
grows with growing ¯Ω.

IV. DISCUSSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS

In the present paper we have considered the radiation
properties of charged particles in Brownian motion. To
model the electromagnetic emissivity properties of the
particles we have adopted the Langevin and the gener-
alized Langevin equation, respectively, which give a full
description of the particle-external environment system.
In order to solve the Langevin equations we have adopted
a numerical approach, based on the use of some numerical
integrators. Due to the stochastic, random distribution
of the physical parameters of the particles, complex radi-
ation patterns can be generated in the presence of some
random forces generated by the particle environment. In
particular we have found that for speciﬁc oscillation fre-
quencies some peaks are present in the PSD curves of the
emitted electromagnetic radiation for charged Brownian
particles moving in external harmonic potentials. The
presence of resonant stochastic peaks in the PSD of the
energy emission can be used to explain astrophysical ob-
servations. For example, in [36, 37] it was shown that the
simulated PSD curves of luminosity for stochastically os-
cillating general relativistic disks [43] have the same pro-
ﬁle as the observed PSD of black hole X-ray binaries in
the low-hard state. Hence resonant eﬀect in the accre-
tion disk oscillations may provide an alternative inter-
pretation of the persistent low-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations in astrophysical systems. The stochastic elec-

tromagnetic radiation model, representing an interplay
between deterministic and stochastic processes, includ-
ing resonance phenomena, could also be used to explain
strongly peaked astrophysical eﬀects in black hole-binary
systems.

Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are a commonly
occurring phenomenon in astrophysical observations,
with many kHz QPOs detected in the light curves of neu-
tron stars and black hole sources [44]. Since the orbital
frequencies of high frequency QPOs lie in the range of or-
bital frequencies of geodesics just few Schwarzschild radii
outside the central massive source [45]. This observation
strongly suggest that the QPOs could be related to the
orbital motion of particles in an accretion disk [46]. An
interesting theoretical model explaining the QPO prop-

erties is the Abramowicz-Kluzniak resonance model [47],
which starts from pointing out the importance of the
observed 3:2 frequency ratio, and that the commensu-
rability of frequencies may be a clear signature of the
existence of resonance in the astrophysical system. From
observational point of view the fact that for kHz QPOs
the frequencies scale with 1/M , where M is the mass of
the central object, provide a strong support to the idea
that they are due to orbital oscillations [45]. By adopting
the above approach it follows that from a mathematical
point of view QPOs can be modelled by analyzing the
time evolution of perturbed nearby Keplerian geodesics,
which can be described by the equations [45]

¨z(t) + ωθz(t) = f [ρ(t), z(t), r0, θ0] ,

(58)

¨ρ(t) + ωrρ(t) = g [ρ(t), z(t), r0, θ0] ,

(59)

where z(t) and ρ(t) denotes the small deviations from
the circular orbit (r0, θ0), ωθ and ωr are the epicyclic fre-
quencies, while the functions f and g describe the cou-
plings between particle motion and external perturba-
tions. However, the astrophysical model described by
Eqs. (58) and (59) does not take into account the com-
plexity of the processes taking place in the central re-
gions of accretion disks, like, for example, the Magneto-
Rotational Instability induced turbulence. Therefore a
stochasticized version of Eqs. (58) and (59) was proposed
in [45], with the evolution of the perturbations described
by the stochastic equations

¨z(t) + ωθz(t) − f [ρ(t), z(t), r0, θ0] = σzβ(t),

(60)

¨ρ(t) + ωrρ(t) = g [ρ(t), z(t), r0, θ0] ,

(61)

where σz is a constant, while β(t) is a continuous Gaus-
sian white-noise process, with zero mean, and unit vari-
ance, respectively. In this model the noise term acts only
along the vertical direction. By using the above equations
it is possible to show that the presence of the stochas-
tic noise can trigger the appearance of resonances in the
epicyclic oscillations of nearly Keplerian disks [45]. From
a mathematical point of view Eqs. (60) and (61) are sim-
ilar to the oscillation equations considered in the present
paper, without the dissipation term included. Hence the
present approach may allow the study of more general
QPO models, in which the complex physical behavior of
the central region of the accretion disks may be modelled
by stochastic diﬀerential equations involving dissipative
and memory eﬀects.

For cases II and III, preliminary calculations show
that aside from the qualitative similarity to observational
QPO signatures, some of the peaks have a Q factor which
is larger than 2, but not much; however, the industry of
accurate and un-debatable calculation of Q factors from
nontrivial, multi-peaks PSD is beyond the purpose of this
paper and we reserve it for future work.

We point out that in the parameter space considered in
this paper, there was no additional feature in the PSDs
calculated for cases where there was no reason to expect
periodicity, i.e.
the ﬁrst and last. When there was a
periodic behavior embedded in the system, the complex
interplay between noise, friction, memory and a harmonic
potential lead to the appearance of a new feature in
the PSD, with QPO characteristics.

Another possible astrophysical application of the mod-
els developed in the present paper can be related to

18

the study of the properties of the Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs). GRBs are very powerful, sudden, and short
cosmic gamma-ray emissions, from astrophysical sources
situated at cosmological distances. The typical energy
ﬂuxes in GRBs range from 10−5 to 5 × 10−4 erg cm−2,
while the time intervals during which the gamma ray
emissions take place are of the order of 10−2 to 103 s
[48, 49]. Non-thermal photons are also observed in GRB
explosions, and their presence is usually explained by ei-
ther synchrotron emission, or inverse Compton scatter-
ing by relativistic electrons in strong magnetic ﬁelds [49].
The electrons, obeying a power-law distribution, are as-
sumed to have been accelerated to relativistic energies in
the shocks generated in the optically thin regions of the
matter outﬂowing from the explosion center. A possible
alternative to the synchrotron radiation model for ex-
plaining the non-thermal radiative properties of GRBs is
represented by the jitter radiation model. In this model
the radiation originates from relativistic electrons accel-
erated in strong stochastic magnetic ﬁelds [30]-[33]. On
the other hand the physical characteristics of the radia-
tion in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds, or a turbulent cosmic
medium, can be studied by using the Langevin equation
description, together with the numerical methods devel-
oped in the present approach to the problem of the ra-
diation emission by charged particles in Brownian mo-
tion. Therefore the theoretical models introduced in the
present paper may contribute to a better understand-
ing of the astrophysical processes taking place during the
main explosive phase, or during the afterglow of the GRB
explosions.

The astrophysical implications of the methods and re-
sults obtained in our theoretical and numerical analysis
will be explored in detail in a future publication. In the
present paper we have only presented some basic theoret-
ical tools that can be used for the in-depth modelling and
comparison of the astrophysical observations of stochasti-
cally varying luminosity sources with the theoretical pre-
dictions of the physical models.
