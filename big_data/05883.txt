Abstract

We make an attempt to identify regions in a Type II Two-Higgs Doublet Model, which correspond

to a metastable electroweak vacuum with lifetime larger than the age of the universe. We analyse

scenarios which retain perturbative unitarity up to Grand uniﬁcation and Planck scales. Each point in

the parameter space is restricted using Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as ﬂavor

and precision electroweak constraints. We ﬁnd that substantial regions of the parameter space are thus

identiﬁed as corresponding to metastability, which compliment the allowed regions for absolute stability,

for top quark mass at the high as well as low end of its currently allowed range. Thus, a two-Higgs

doublet scenario with the electroweak vacuum, either stable or metastable, can sail through all the way

up to the Planck scale without facing any contradictions.

1 Introduction

With the observation of a scalar resonance around 125 GeV at the LHC [1, 2], and hence its identication

with a Higgs boson, the particle spectrum of the Standard Model (SM) appears to be complete. However,

issues ranging from the existence of Dark Matter (DM) to the pattern of neutrino mass continue to suggest

physics beyond the SM. While the quest for such new physics remains on, a rather pertinent question to

ask is whether the SM by itself can ensure vacuum stability at scales above that of electroweak symmetry

breaking. This is because the Higgs quartic coupling evolving via SM interaction alone tends to turn negative

in between the Electroweak (EW) and Planck scales, thereby making the scalar potential unbounded from

below. This exact location of this instability scale crucially depends on the pole masses of the top quark and

the Higgs. A recent next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) study [3, 4] ﬁnds that absolute stability up to the

Planck scale requires [3]

Mh[GeV] > 129.4 + 1.4(

Mt[GeV] − 173.1

0.7

) − 0.5(

αs(MZ) − 0.1184

0.0007

) ± 1.0th

(1.1)

The updated measurements of the Higgs and top quark masses [REF] hint towards a metastable vacuum

scenario. Such a scenario leads to an additional minimum in the potential, which is deeper than the elec-

troweak vacuum [5]. However the lifetime of the latter is less than the age of the universe, thus enabling the

present day vacuum to be consistent with the well tested electroweak theory.

In general, vacuum instability can be alleviated by introducing additional bosonic degrees of freedom,

which can oﬀset the downward evolution of the quartic coupling of the SM. Such a possibility has indeed

been explored in the context of various non-minimal Higgs sectors. One example would be the case of the

celebrated Two-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). Diﬀerent types of 2HDM oﬀer interesting phenomenology

at present and future colliders and, are consistent with ﬂavor physics constraints, and are part and parcel of

supersymmetric theories. In one of our earlier works, we showed in context of a Type-II 2HDM that the EW

vacuum can be rendered stable till the Planck scale even for a top pole mass at the high end of the allowed

band [6]. Moreover, this can be achieved without running into conﬂict with perturbativity or unitarity at

high scales.

A 2HDM is set has one more vital feature. The Yukawa couplings of the SM fermions can be diﬀerent

compared to the SM values, in a 2HDM. The role of the coupling for the same Mt can thus produce a
diﬀerent eﬀect to the evolution to the quartics. A stable vacuum till the Planck scale is achieved with

speciﬁc combinations of the boundary conditions, i.e, given in terms of the model parameters. This raises

the question, is there a possible metastable vacuum in a 2HDM? Can such a balance between the bosonic

and fermionic eﬀects be struck that indeed leads to an additional minimum of the scalar potential, while

prolonging the lifetime of the EW vacuum to a safe level? This is the question we precisely seek to answer

in this work.

Metastability in context of certain non-minimal Higgs scenarii has been looked into in the recent times

and along with the attempts of embedding successful cold dark matter canditates in the parameter space

that leads to a stable/metastable vacuum. These studies however confront inert scalars that do not mix

with the SM Higgs owing to some discrete symmetry, and moreover, the Higgs-top coupling also remains

unchanged with respect to the SM. The implications could be diﬀerent in a 2HDM where EWSB is triggered

when both the doublets receive vacuum expectation values (vev). Two possibilities open thus up: (a) The

scalar potential could furnish additional neutral minima around the TeV scale ballpark in the slice spanned

2

by the neutral ﬁelds in the two doublets, and, (b) Additional minimum can appear when the scalar potential

is improved by Renormalisation Group (RG) eﬀects. In the process of looking for such possibilities, we take

into account miscellaneous constraints coming from Higgs signal strengths, ﬂavor issues and electroweak

precision observables.

The paper has the following plan. In Sec. 2, we review the salient features of the 2HDMs. Sec. 3 is

dedicated to a discussion on how a metastable vacuum can arise, and on the completion of its lifetime. We

also present an outline of the tunnelling probability computation in the same. Sec. 4 presents an overall

strategy on how to look for a metastable vacua, and, also an account of the various experimental and

theoretical constraints taken while doing so. The numerical results are highlighted in Sec. 5 and ﬁnally the

study is concluded in Sec. 6.

This scenario in general has the possibility of CP-violation in the scalar sector, through the phases in

m12, λ5, λ6 and λ7. We choose m12 to be real here, moreover the terms proportional to λ6 and λ7 have been
neglected in the present study.

In a general two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), a particular fermion can couple to both Φ1 and Φ2.
However this would lead to the ﬂavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) at the tree level1. One way to
avoid such FCNC is to impose a Z2 symmetry, such as one that demands invariance under Φ1 → −Φ1 and
Φ2 → Φ2. This type of symmetry puts restrictions on the scalar potential. The Z2 symmetry is exact as
long as m12, λ6 and λ7 vanish, when the scalar sector also becomes CP-conserving. The symmetry is said
to be broken softly if it is violated in the quadratic terms only, i.e., in the limit where λ6 and λ7 vanish but
m12 does not. Finally, a hard breaking of the Z2 symmetry is realized when it is broken by the quartic terms
as well. Thus in this case, m12, λ6 and λ7 all are non-vanishing in general.

We focus on a particular scheme of coupling fermions to the doublets. This scheme is known in the

literature as the Type-II 2HDM, where the down type quarks and the charged leptons couple to Φ1 and the
R → −ψi
up type quarks, to Φ2 [18]. This is ensured through the discrete symmetry Φ1 → −Φ1 and ψi
R,
where ψ is charged leptons or down type quarks and i represents the generation index.

1In context of a typical ﬂavour changing scenario, it has been shown recently that the FCNCs are stable under RG evolution

mostly.

Since the basis used in V (Φ1, Φ2) allows mixing between the two doublets, the physical states are obtained by
diagonalising the charged and neutral scalar mass matrices. There are then altogether eight mass eigenstates,
three of which become the longitudinal components of the W ± and Z gauge bosons. Of the remaining ﬁve,
there is a mutually conjugate pair of charged scalars (H±), two neutral CP even scalars (H, h) and a neutral
pseudoscalar (A), given there is no CP-violation. Otherwise, a further mixing between (H, h) and A becomes

unavoidable. The compositions of the mass eigenstates H and h indeed depend on the mixing angle α.

The quartic couplings are conveniently expressed in terms of the physical masses and mixing angles as,

The existence of a large number of scalar degrees of freedom makes the vacuum landscape of a 2HDM more

elaborate and intriguing compared to the SM. Here we are conﬁning ourselves to the situation when the

vacuum breaks neither electric charge nor CP. Under such circumstances, the EWSB conditions appear as,

It has been reported in [7] that the above conditions can lead to several solutions, and at most two non-

degenerte minima. In other words, apart from the EW minimum in which the universe currently resides

4

1 + v2

2 = 246 GeV2, named N ), there exists another minimum somewhere around (v2

(v2
named N(cid:48)). Ref. ﬁnds the diﬀerence of depths of the tree level scalar potential at the two minima to be,

Thus there exists the tantalizing possibility that the 2HDM oﬀers such parameter points for which a neigh-
bouring vacuum could actually be deeper than the one which corresponds to the observed W− and Z−
boson masses. The EW minimum then loses its status as the global munimum and has been termed the

panic vacuum in [7]. In those cases, computing the lifetime of tunnelling to the non-EW minimum from

the EW one becomes the pertinent task. If the tunnelling lifetime turn out to be higher than the age of

the universe, the non-EW minimum cannot be ruled out. However, thanks to the data from the LHC on
Higgs signal strengths, the model points admitting VN(cid:48) − VN < 0 are more or less ruled out [7, 8]. However,
a new landscape of vacua can still open up if one investigates the renormalisation-group improved eﬀective

potential in place of the bare tree-level one. In the context of the SM, it can be understood as follows: The
SM quartic coupling turns negative at some energy scale 108−11 GeV (exact location of the scale depends
on the choice of the initial conditions), after which it again starts rising owing to the bosonic eﬀects coun-

terbalancing the negative top-Yukawa drag. The fallout of this is the emergence of a new minimum beyond

the scale where the quartic coupling ﬁrst becomes negative. It should be noted that the direction of the EW

vacuum uniquely decides the direction in which the high-scale vacuum is formed.

In a 2HDM, on the other hand, one has to handle the additional complication of having a higher number

of ﬁeld directions. In addition, the eﬀects of the various interaction terms make it imperative to incorporate

the eﬀects of radiative corrections induced by the 2HDM. Therefore, we choose to analyse the one-loop

corrected eﬀective potential in place of the tree level potential. One thus writes

Vef f (h1, h2) = Vtree(h1, h2) + V1loop(h1, h2)

(3.4)

Here, Vtree(h1, h2) and V1loop(h1, h2) denote the tree level and 1-loop parts of the eﬀective potential, calcu-
lated along the h1 − h2 subspace.

For example, , the tree level potential reads

Studies on the high-scale validity of a 2HDM in the past were mostly conﬁned to investigating absolute

stability [9–12] Some studies connecting higher dimensional operators to Higgs metastability have occured

in the past [13, 14]. The main theme of this work is to investigate possible high scale vacua in the context

of 2HDM using the prescription suggested by Coleman. Vef f (h1, h2) depends on two variables, and hence,

5

determining a classical solution interpolating the two vacua, even numerically, becomes an extremely chal-

lenging task. Furthermore, a generic classical path may not qualify as a ”bounce” [15, 16], i.e, it might not

pass through the top of a barrier separating two vacua. Coleman’s presciption does not apply in such a case.
However, one can alway choose to look for additional minima along a particular ray in the h1 − h2 plane.
Under this approximation, the eﬀective potential is reduced to a function of a single variable again(that

particular linear combination of h1 and h2). In models such as Type I or Type II 2HDM, the Z2 symmetry
of the Yukawa interactions implies that the top quark always couples to Φ2. Thus it is the coupling λ2 that
experiences the maximum downward pull due to the Yukawa interactions and can consequently can turn

negative at high scales in spite of starting with a positive value at the input scale. It therefore makes sense

to look for additional minima in the h2 direction only. This approach is similar to what [17] opts in context
of an inert doublet model.

We study the behaviour of the Vef f (h1, h2) in the limit where h1 (cid:39) v and h2 >> h1, m12. In this limit,

the squared masses have the following simpliﬁed expressions:

condition for the loss of stability of the EW vacuum. There is in general an extended set of conditions for

stability in a 2HDM [18]. However, one can easily verify that the remaining conditions for stability in a

2HDM are violated, if at all, at low scale itself. Such violation, on the other hand, leads to the disappearance

of the EW minimum as a whole. This cannot be a situation appropriate for metastability, and therefore the

consitions other than λ2 < 0 need not be used as signs for loss of stability.

4 A metastable vacuum and the 2HDM parameter space.

4.1 Analysis strategy.

As has been already in the previous section a look-out for an additional vacuum at high scales requires one

to study the evolution of the the various interaction strengths under under renormalization group equations.

The values of the quartic couplings at the electroweak scale are, of course, connected with the masses and

mixing angles in the scalar sector. A careful measurement of the signal strengths of the 125 GeV at the LHC

has revealed that the resonance has couplings strikingly similar to the SM ones. These observations have
their ramiﬁcations on the 2HDM parameter space. Thus together with the requirement of having mh (cid:39) 125
GeV, we also arrange for β − α (cid:39) π
2 is
the well known alignment limit [19] in a 2HDM, in which the couplings of h to fermions and gauge bosons

2 , in order to comply with these results from the LHC (β − α = π

become exactly equal to the SM ones). We choose to describe a 2HDM parameter point in terms of the
parameters (tan β, mh, mH , mA, mH +, α) basis. There are additional constraints to satisfy as outlined in the
next few subsections,

4.1.1 Perturbativity, unitarity and vacuum stability

For the 2HDM to remain a perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory at a given energy scale, one must impose the
4π (i = t, b, τ ) at that scale2. This translates into upper

conditions |λi| ≤ 4π (i = 1, . . . , 7) and |yi| ≤ √

bounds on the running couplings at low as well as high scales.

A more sophisticated version of such bounds comes from the the requirement of partial wave unitarity
in longitudinal gauge boson scattering. The 2→2 amplitude matrix corresponding to scattering of the
longitudinal components of the gauge bosons can be mapped to a corresponding matrix for the scattering

of the goldstone bosons [20, 21]. The theory respects unitarity if each eigenvalue of the aforementioned

amplitude matrix does not exceed 8π.

2The conditions are slightly diﬀerent for the two types of couplings. The reason becomes clear if we note that the perturbative

scattering processes is |yi|2

When the quartic part of the scalar potential preserves CP and Z2 symmetries, the aforementioned

eigenvalues are discussed in [20–22].

The condition to be discussed next is that of vacuum stability. For the scalar potential of a theory

to be stable, it must be bounded from below in all possible directions. This condition is threatened if the

quartic part of the scalar potential, which is responsible for its behaviour at large ﬁeld values, turns negative.

Avoiding such a possibility till any given scale ensures stability of the vacuum up to that scale. Vacuum

stability in context of a 2HDM has been discussed in detail in [7]

Demanding high-scale positivity of the 2HDM potential along various directions in the ﬁeld space leads

to the following conditions on the scalar potential. [18, 23],

When a second vacuum arises, we go for a test of metastability of the electroweak vacuum using vsc2 alone.

The reason for this has already been discussed at the end of section 3.

4.1.2 Oblique parameters and ﬂavor constraints.

A 2HDM contributes to the electroweak precision obsevables through the participation of the additional

scalars in loops. For example, the oblique S, T and U parameters receive contributions ∆S, ∆T and ∆U

repectively from the 2HDM. The most constraining amongst these is ∆T which reads,

We have ﬁltered the model points through the constraint ∆T = 0.05 ± 0.12 following [24]. On the
restrictions coming from the ﬂavor physics side, measurement of the b → sγ leads to mH + ≥ 315 GeV in
case of the Type-II 2HDM [25]. In case of Type-I, there is no such lower bound. The constraint mH + ≥ 80
GeV originating from direct searches however still persists.

5 Results and discussions.

Model points that successfully negotiate all the aforesaid constraints are allowed to evolve under RG, till

some scale Λ (say). Λ is essentially identiﬁed as the scale where perturbative unitarity is destroyed, and can

be interpreted as the scale up to which no physics over and above the extended Higgs sector is required.

If there is an additional, lower vacuum before Λ, the time scale for tunneling from the EW vacua to the

new one must therefore be larger than the age of the universe. It is intuitively expected that higher is Λ,

tighter becomes the parameter space that is allowed at the electroweak scale. This is indeed conﬁrmed by the

ﬁndings reported in REF. Of course the points leading to a metastable EW vacuum are identiﬁed through a

detailed scan of the parameter space. However, the fate of a particular model point at high scales is sensitive

to the value of the top quark mass taken. With this in view, we propose the benchmarks listed in Table 1.

in Fig 1 The chosen benchmarks diﬀer in their perturbative be-

haviour at high scales, although all of them have the common feature that the EW vacuum turns metastable,

or even unstable for Mt = 175 GeV. In other words, the Type-II 2HDM may turn non-perturbative beyond
a scale Λ, even though a vacuum deeper than the EW one might be encountered someplace intermediate

between the electroweak scale and Λ. Besides, although it is worth identifying those parameter points that

keep the EW vacuum metastable all the way till the GUT or Planck scales, we also include for completeness

in the benchmarks, two points where a 2HDM loses its perturbativity at a much lower scale. For instance
dt = 0 occurs around 6.2 × 106 GeV (The scale at

albeit it remains perturbative till 1011 GeV.

remind the reader that the strength of the top quark Yukawa coupling depends not only on the pole mass,

but also on tanβ. This becomes crucial in deciding the fate of the EW vacuum at high scales. For instance,

BP5 experiences a higher t-quark negative pull compared to BP4 owing to a lower value of tanβ in BP5,

even though the quartic couplings at the input scale are at the same ball-park for the two cases. BP6 is a

ﬁne-tuned parameter point that is perturbative till the Planck scale, and for which the EW vacuum is stable,

metastable or unstable for Mt = 171 GeV, 173 GeV and 175 GeV respectively. For the sake of completeness,
we display the behaviour Vef f (h2) for Mt = 173 GeV case in Fig 2.

Model points are randomly sampled in the following speciﬁed ranges,

tan β ∈ [0.1, 20.0]
mH , mA, mH +, m12 ∈ [0, 1200 GeV ]

(5.1)

A condition forbidding the loss of perturbativity/unitarity at scale Λ is imposed throughout the scan.

The following broad features emerge from Fig 3 and Fig. 4 The results are shown for Fig. 3 onwards two
representative values of Λ, namely 1016 GeV (Fig.3) and Λ = 1019 GeV (Fig.4).

(i) Perturbativity puts stringent constraints on the splitting amongst the masses. In fact, for Λ = 1019
GeV the masses are near-degenerate. This eﬀect can be attributed to the fact that for a large mass a split-

ting, the couplings are already large at the input scale, leading to a blow-up soon after. An individual mass

does nor get bounded from the above however. Thus, a perturbative theory till high scale automatically

respects the T-parameter constraint.

(ii) A smaller tanβ for the same Mt implies an enhanced fermionic contribution to the evolution of λ2,
and hence it favors a metastable vacuum over an absolutely stable one. Consequently, tanβ is bounded from

below in order to prevent tunelling to the lower vacuum. Moreover, one would apprehend that the bound

by obtained by demanding absolute stability of the EW vacuum to be the stronger than the one obtained
when one allows for a metastable scenario. For instance, for Mt = 171 GeV, the lower bounds read (cid:39) 2.1
and (cid:39) 2.5 for the two cases.
(iii) The lower bound on tanβ of course depends on the choice of Mt. For instance the parameter point
parametrised in terms of the masses and tanβ indeed shall have diﬀerent evolution trajectories for two

diﬀerent values of Mt. This is reﬂected in the upper and lower plots of Fig 3, where one witnesses a tighter
lower bound, for both the ”stable” as well as ”metastable” models. Of course, in this case too, absolute

stability yields a stronger bound than metastability. For this value of Mt, any model with tanβ < 2.6 yields
a tunneling lifetime lower than the age of the universe.

(iv) Although the lower bound on tanβ should also depend on the Λ chosen, it hardly changes with respect
to the 1016 GeV value for Λ = 1019 GeV. Only the number of allowed points shrinks to some extent, other
essential features are unchanged.

In the plane of tanβ vs masses, it is expected that a particular parameter point responsible for a metastable
EW vacuum can always be found in the vicinity of a point that leads to absolute stability, tanβ ≥ 3.0. This
gets conﬁrmed by an inspection of Fig. 4. This can be understood from the fact that any enhanced fermionic

contribution due to a higher tanβ can always be cancelled by an appropriately increased bosonic contribution

through a slight tweak in the masses . Of course, one also has to keep the couplings perturbative in doing

Such a ”ﬁne-tuned” existence of a metastable EW vacuum is not a surprise and is always expected in

the case of an extended Higgs sector, such as the 2HDM.

We take another approach where diﬀerent scalar masses are ﬁxed within speciﬁc narrow ranges, and allow

tanβ to vary. This approach turns useful in demarcating the ”stable” region from the ”metastable”. We

thus propose two central values of 500 GeV and 1000 GeV and allow only a 2 GeV split about that. Fig. 5

presents the results for this choice.

2HDM II refers to a Type II 2HDM.

For masses around 500 GeV and Mt = 171 GeV, the metastable points mostly cluster in the low tanβ
region. They get largely disfavored at larger tanβ. Since the bosonic contribution to RG evolution is now
restrained, absolute stability demands tanβ ≥ 3.0. For Mt = 175 GeV however, lower bound on tanβ for
both stability as well as metastability goes up, stability completely ruled out for tanβ ≤ 5.0 for instance.
Thus, for Mt = 175 GeV, the proportion of metastable model points is higher compared to what is seen for
Mt = 175 GeV. The robustness of this claim is veriﬁed by the plots for masses (cid:39) 1000 GeV, which depict
the same qualitative behaviour. Having pointed out the crucial role played by the parameter tanβ, we close

6 Summary and outlook

This work highlights the possibility of a metastable EW vacuum in a popular 2HDM framework. While the

occurrence of a panic vacuum in a 2HDM is by and large disfavored by the latest data from the LHC, we

observe that a global minimum at high scales is indeed possible, iﬀ RG eﬀects are incorporated into the

scalar potential. This is found to happen in the direction of the scalar ﬁeld h2, because λ2 can be driven to
negative values at high scales . We have reported our ﬁndings in context of a type II 2HDM.

We remark that it is the relative strengths of the fermionic and bosonic contributions in the RG improved

potential that seals the fate of the EW vacuum where we currently reside. The introduction of additional

bosonic degrees of freedom further introduces a tension between vacuum stability on the one hand, and,

high-scale perturbativity on the other. This tension can be responsible for substantial constraints on the

parameter space.

In a 2HDM, the strength of the fermionic contribution is controlled by not only the top quark pole mass,

but also tanβ. Based on the results of this work, one would always expect a metastable model point in the

vicinity of a point allowing for absolute stability. However, tanβ picks up a lower bound from the requirement

of metastability, which is tightened when one demands absolute stability of the EW vacuum. The sensitivity

of the results to the top pole mass has also been emphasized.

A pertinent extension would be to include ﬁnite temperature corrections to the 2HDM scalar potential

and, study its impact on vacuum stability.
