ABSTRACT

this approximation requires a minimum of only(cid:0)N +O

(cid:1) calculations: e.g. a quadratic spectral model (O = 2),

Stellar spectra depend on the stellar parameters and on dozens of photospheric elemental abundances. Simul-
taneous ﬁtting of these N ∼ 10 − 40 model labels to observed spectra has been deemed unfeasible, because
the number of ab initio spectral model grid calculations scales exponentially with N . We suggest instead the
construction of a polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order O for the model ﬂux at each wavelength. Building
which can then ﬁt N = 20 labels simultaneously, can be constructed from as few as 231 ab initio spectral
model calculations; in practice, a somewhat larger number (∼ 300 − 1000) of randomly chosen models lead to
a better performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation to ab initio spectral models only over a
limited portion of label space, which will vary case by case. Yet, taking the APOGEE survey as an example, we
found that one single quadratic PSM provides a remarkably good approximation to the exact ab initio spectral
models across much of this survey: for random labels within that survey the PSM approximates the ﬂux to
within 10−3, and recovers the abundances to within ∼ 0.02 dex rms of the exact models. We suggest that this
enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label ﬁtting of spectra with computationally expensive ab
initio models for stellar spectra, such as non-LTE models.

1. FITTING STELLAR SPECTRA

The spectra of stars encode an enormous amount of infor-
mation, mainly about the stars’ current physical state and the
composition of the chemical elements in their photosphere.
But the number of stellar labels6 that fully specify a spec-
trum is large: a handful of stellar parameters and much of the
periodic table. We know that stellar spectra with S/N∼ 100
and R ∼ 20,000 − 40,000, currently emerging for 104−6 ob-
jects from various surveys, contain the information to con-
strain 10–40 labels, at least for stars with favorable effective
temperatures, ∼ 4000K–7000K (e.g., Smiljanic et al. 2014;
García Pérez et al. 2015; Sheinis et al. 2015). The accuracy
and precision of label estimates for vast stellar samples mat-
ters greatly for understanding the formation of the Milky Way,
stellar physics, and the origin of the chemical elements (e.g.,
Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002; Rix & Bovy 2013; Frebel
& Norris 2015).

A principled determination of these stellar labels requires
to ﬁt the data with physical model spectra, in which the stellar
labels constitute 10–40 model parameters. The calculation of
such ab initio spectral models (a.i. models) through radiative
transfer calculations has a storied tradition (for an overview,
see Smiljanic et al. 2014; García Pérez et al. 2015). Current
a.i. models vary by the degree of physical simpliﬁcation they

6 We use the term “labels” to mean the union of stellar parameters and
photospheric elemental abundances, because in the current context these two
classes of stellar attributes are being treated equivalently.

apply: LTE vs non-LTE; plane-parallel vs spherical geometry;
1D, averaged 3D, or full 3D; static vs time dependent. And
these models vary by the extent and robustness of the atomic
data that underlie the radiative transfer.

The computation of a.i. models is expensive, all the more
so if the simplifying assumptions are dropped. This is why
“brute force” ﬁtting of spectra with a.i. models (of, say, 10–
40 labels) is unfeasible for the foreseeable future: most ap-
proaches to ﬁtting a.i. models to observed spectra have relied
on pre-computing grids of a.i. spectra in the N -dimensional
label space, and then interpolating between them pixel-by-
pixel, e.g., quadratically (i.e., 2nd-order) or cubic (i.e., 3rd-
order) as in Allende Prieto et al. (2006, 2014). But for any
number of grid points, M ≈ 3−5, in each label-dimension, the
total number of a.i. model calculations required grows expo-
nentially with the dimension N of label space: Ntot ∝ MN ∝
exp(N · lnM). Established approaches have coped with this
in practice by ﬁtting models spectra ﬁrst in a 3–6 dimensional
sub-space of N , and subsequently ﬁtting one (or two) further
label at a time, holding the initial labels ﬁxed. This approach
has important limitations with with state of-the-art data: ﬁrst,
Ting et al. (2016) (hereafter T16) has shown that more than
just 2 or 3 elemental abundances affect the atmosphere struc-
ture, and hence are physically covariant with the basic stellar
parameters; second, physical correlations and data-driven co-
variances are known to exist among (abundance) labels, but
cannot be estimated when ﬁtting one label at a time; third, to
mitigate against unaccounted covariances, established ﬁtting
approaches have often focused on unblended lines, thereby
under-exploiting the information content of the data by a large
factor (T16).

T16 proposed a way to overcome this impasse by employ-
ing more linear algebra in the ﬁtting, to save on a.i. model
calculations; in this Letter we take this idea a step further.
T16 proposed to tessellate the space of stellar labels into a ﬁ-
nite set of regions (dubbed linear Taylor-spheres, or 1OTS).
Within each 1OTS the a.i. model ﬂux at each wavelength

2

can be described sufﬁciently well by a linearized spectral
model (LSM), linearized (in all labels) around the a.i. model
spectrum at a ﬁducial label value (see also Recio-Blanco
et al. 2006). T16 showed that such LSM can sufﬁciently ap-
proximate the exact model spectra within a 1OTS. Together
with the ﬁnite number of Taylor-spheres, required to cover
any given spectral survey (e.g., ∼ 150 for the APOGEE red
clumps), this leads to a dramatic reduction in the total num-
ber of a.i. model calculations: simultaneous ﬁtting of 10–40
labels should then be feasible.

Here we point out a rather obvious extension of this idea,
which yields even greater computational savings:
the con-
struction of approximate model spectra, where the predicted
ﬂux at each pixel by a polynomial in all labels away from
a ﬁducial model spectrum. This idea had been put forth by
Prugniel et al. (2011) for empirical spectra, who did, however,
not pursue its potential of ﬁtting many labels simultaneously.
We denote such approximate polynomials spectral models as
PSM, to distinguish them from the a.i. models themselves. It
is important not to think of these PSM as a Oth-order inter-
polation between a pre-calculated grid of a.i. models (as e.g.,
Prugniel et al. (2011) did for a PSM in three labels), as this
grid ∝ exp(N · lnMgrid) a.i. model calcu-
would still require MN
lations. Instead, one should think of determining the (near)-
smallest number of a.i. model spectra (speciﬁed by N labels)
one needs to calculate in order to construct a Oth-order ap-
proximation to the a.i. model spectra. The simpliﬁcation and
speed-up of such spectral ﬁtting compared to T16 arise from
the fact that a single PSM can approximate the a.i. model
spectra over a much larger volume in label space.
In the subsequent Sections we ﬁrst derive that the minimal
number of a.i. models needed to construct a PSM of order O
and then illustrate heuristically how well, and over what vol-
umes in label space, these PSMs approximate the a.i. models.

2. A POLYNOMIAL MODEL APPROXIMATION FOR AB INITIO

MODEL SPECTRA OF STARS

Following T16, we suppose that an a.i. modeling “machin-
ery” can predict the normalized ﬂux of a synthetic spectrum,
fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)), given a set of stellar labels, (cid:96). We assume that
the a.i. model spectra change from point to point in label-
space, but do so smoothly or differentiably at every wave-
length. Then the a.i. model spectrum at any (cid:96) sufﬁciently
close to an model grid point (cid:96)∗ (within a 1st-order Taylor-
sphere or 1OTS, in the nomenclature of T16) can therefore
be described with high accuracy by a linear spectral model
(LSM, see T16):

flin(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) (cid:39) fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗) + ∆(cid:96)T · −→g (λ|(cid:96)∗),

where −→g (λ|(cid:96)∗) ≡ −→∇(cid:96)fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗).
In principle, specifying a LSM merely requires 1+N model
calculations, but T16 showed a a factor of a few more is
needed to explore the actual extent of the 1OTS. This LSM
approximation, flin, can obviously be generalized to a polyno-
mial spectra model (PSM):

(1)

fPSM(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) (cid:39) fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗) + ∆(cid:96)T · −→g (λ|(cid:96)∗)
+ ∆(cid:96)T · H (λ|(cid:96)∗)· ∆(cid:96) + ... ,

(2)

where we will focus on 2nd-order, both for astrophysical rea-
sons (it may work well enough) and to avoid cumbersome
notation. Such a PSM holds for every one of the K wave-
lengths λ. One may think of it as a model with K 0th-order

O

(cid:1).

terms, fPSM(λk|(cid:96)∗), then K × N 1st-order terms, and ﬁnally
K ×N (N + 1)/2 2nd-order terms. The number N (N + 1)/2
arises because of the symmetry of H. In total that makes for

(3)
unknown terms. For more general PSM of order O, one has

K × Ntot ≡ K ×(cid:0)1 +N + N · (N + 1)/2(cid:1)
K × Ntot = K ×(cid:0)N +O
(cid:1) different
If we compute a.i. models fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗ +∆(cid:96)) at(cid:0)N +O
points in label space, ∆(cid:96), we have created exactly K × Ntot
left-hand-side terms to solve exactly for the terms that specify
the PSM. Note that strictly speaking −→g (λ|(cid:96)∗) and H (λ|(cid:96)∗)
are not exactly the “gradient” and the “Hessian”, but merely
the 1st and 2nd-order coefﬁcients that solve the equation.
Compared to the 1OTS, we have to calculate 1+N /2 times
more a.i. models for any one quadratic PSM. But if the the
region in label space around (cid:96)∗ over with this quadratic PSM
works is sufﬁciently larger, an important speed-up over the
the (set of) LSM should result. Calculating somewhat more
a.i. models than this minimum, and solving Eq.2 in a least
squares sense, makes for a much better conditioned solution
for a PSM, as we show below.

3. VERIFICATION OF PSM ACCURACY, USING KURUCZ MODELS

FOR APOGEE-LIKE SPECTRA

Strictly verifying the validity of the PSM approximation,
like any approximation to a high-dimensional function, would
be of enormous computational expense. Here, too, escaping
the curse of dimensionality comes at a price: relying on the
physically plausible assumption that spectral ﬂux changes can
be approximated by polynomials for modest label changes;
and settling for heuristic and approximate ways to explore the
extent in label space over which a single PSM is useful.

As in T16, we can set out for a pragmatic test of the PSM
approximation. To be speciﬁc, we use Kurucz model spec-
tra that resemble in resolution and wavelength coverage the
APOGEE spectra; the arguments should hold qualitatively for
other surveys, but need to be tested case-by-case. In total, the
DR12 data release of the APOGEE (Alam et al. 2015; Holtz-
man et al. 2015) provides 17 labels for each star (Teff, logg
and 15 elemental abundances) while ﬁxing vmacro = 6km/s and
adopting a logg − vturb relation for vturb. A quadratic PSM for
19 labels requires a minimum Ntot = 210 a.i. model calcula-
tions. We chose the reference label, (cid:96)∗, to be the APOGEE
DR12 sample median in each of the 19 labels, providing
fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗) in Eq.2. The vast majority of targets in APOGEE
are disk stars with all [X/H] > −1, and we restrict our PSM
veriﬁcation to this regime. We then drew 209 ∆(cid:96) at ran-
dom from the APOGEE DR12 catalog. For the labels vturb
and vmacro we adopted the same logg − vturb relation from
APOGEE with a spread of 0.2km/s, and a distribution in
vmacro uniform across 3km/s – 8km/s. We convolved spec-
tra to the APOGEE resolution assuming the combined LSF
from APOGEE and using codes from APOGEE-TOOLS (Bovy
2016), and continuum normalized spectra the same way as
The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015). This provided the remaining
209 left-hand sides of Eq.2 to solve exactly for the −→g (λ|(cid:96)∗)
and H (λ|(cid:96)∗), fully speciﬁes fPSM(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) from Eq.2.
As expected by construction of the PSM, fPSM(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96))
matches the a.i. model at all the 210 ∆(cid:96) exactly. This min-
imally constructed PSM also provides good approximations
to fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) for other ∆(cid:96). Empirical experimentation

Figure 1. Quality of the (quadratic) PSM approximation: a single PSM was constructed using 250 or 1,000 a.i. model spectra (cf.
the absolute minimum
number of 231), calculated at label points (“objects”) drawn randomly from those in the APOGEE survey (Alam et al. 2015; Holtzman et al. 2015). The panels
illustrate different PSM – a.i. model comparisons, for 10,000 other objects drawn from the labels of the APOGEE survey. The top left panel shows for a limited
wavelength section the average of the exact a.i. model spectra and of the PSM, which appear indistinguishable. The bottom left panel shows the ensemble average
(absolute) difference between the a.i. model and the PSM ﬂux (the approximation error), as a function of wavelength. For each one of the 10,000 objects there is
a pixel-by-pixel distribution of these approximation errors, which is shown in the top right panel for the pixel-by-pixel average approximation error. The bottom
right panel ﬁnally shows the distribution across all objects of their (pixel-by-pixel) median approximation error. Note that there are rare cases (objects of very
high [Fe/H], where the approximation is only good to a median of 1%. Taken together, however, this shows that a single PSM approximates the exact a.i. model
spectra typically to within 10−3 for objects with a label distribution resembling that of the entire APOGEE survey (which merely serves as an illustration here),
over the 10,000 labels of the median. Constructing the PSM from 1000 instead of 250 random label points leads to a better PSM approximation.
showed that slightly over constraining Eq 2 worked better: we
calculated fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) for 250 and 1000 ∆(cid:96) drawn from
APOGEE, and solved for the right hand side of Eq.2 in a least
squares sense to determine the PSM coefﬁcients.
There are two ways in which one can quantify how well
the PSM, fPSM(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)), approximates fa.i.(λ|(cid:96)∗ + ∆(cid:96)) for
any ∆(cid:96) drawn from APOGEE: how well do the ﬂuxes match,
e.g.in a mean absolute deviation? And, at what accuracy level
does the PSM approximation affect the label recovery?

Fig.1 illustrates how well an a.i. model spectrum of ran-
dom star in APOGEE is can be approximated by the PSM
in a mean absolute deviation sense. On average the PSM-
predicted ﬂux at any wavelength for a random star within
APOGEE is within 10−3 or 10−3.5 of that for its a.i. model
spectrum, depending on whether we used 250 or 1000 a.i.
model calculations to construct the PSM. Fig 2 shows how
much (or, how little) the PSM approximation, calculated here
on the basis of 250 or 1000 a.i. models, affects the label recov-
ery across an APOGEE-like survey. The labels were recov-
ered by a least squares ﬁt of the PSM to noiseless a.i. models,
ﬁtting all 19 labels simultaneously. These were then com-
pared to the actual labels of the respective a.i. models. With a
single PSM, most labels are recovered as accurate as claimed
precisions of current spectral surveys. More quantitatively the
quality of the PSM label recovery is well-tracked by the infor-
mation content that the spectra contain about any one label:
following T16, this is quantiﬁed by the Cramer-Rao bound
(for S/N∼ 100) using either only the APOGEE wavelength
windows for certain elements or the whole spectrum.

The PSM appears heuristically as a better approximation
when calculated on the basis of more a.i. model calculations,
presumably for two reasons: the system of linear equations
in Eq.2 becomes better conditioned; and a better sampling of
label-space better mitigates any break-down of the polyno-
mial approximation. Both factors must play a role: when we
restrict the label range over which we ﬁrst construct and then
test the PSM, the PSM label recovery is even closer to the ex-
act solution. Yet, the PSM constructed on the basis of 1000
(compared to 250) a.i. model calculations is still performing
better. How many models to calculate for the PSM construc-
tion, and over which portion of label space to apply it will
therefore depend in practice on the computational expense of
the a.i. models and the desired label accuracy. Nonetheless,
Fig.1 and Fig.2 demonstrate that with calculating only 250 (or
1000) a.i. models one can construct a single (quadratic) PSM
that performs remarkably well in approximating results from
exact model spectra at random 19-dimensional label location
across much of APOGEE survey.

4. PROSPECTS AND LIMITATIONS

We have shown the advantages for spectral model ﬁtting of
generalizing the local linear expansion of a.i. model spectra
laid out in T16 to higher order, constructing polynomial spec-
tral models (PSM) that approximate the variations of the pre-
dicted spectral ﬂux at each wavelength as a polynomial func-
tion of the labels. This reduces the calculation of the model
spectra needed in simultaneous ﬁtting of many stellar labels to
observed spectra to linear algebra. Compared to established

actual labels of the exact spectrum: PSM-induced errors in the label recovery by the PSM approximation are typically 0.02 dex (when considering the label range
of the APOGEE survey). The dashed and solid lines show the theoretically achievable label precision at S/N= 100 (the Cramer-Rao bound; see T16), when
using the APOGEE wavelength windows, or the full spectrum. A single PSM approximation can be used for ﬁtting all labels simultaneously across much of the
APOGEE survey, without inducing serious systematic errors. The red line indicates typical APOGEE DR12 precisions.
approaches that ﬁrst calculate grids and then interpolate, the
dramatic gain in constructing a PSM comes from the much
more benign scaling of the computational effort with increas-
with O = 2, as opposed to ∝ exp(N · lnM). The way these
PSM are constructed are mathematically very much analo-
gous to data-driven The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015), where
a quadratic spectral model is derived form observed spectra.

of the required training set in The Cannon: we should expect

this makes it plausible that The Cannon could constrain 19 la-
bels from a training set of 10,000 (Casey et al. 2016).

The heuristic veriﬁcation of the PSM approximation, along
with the framework laid out in T16, means that there should
be no longer serious technical obstacles to determining stel-
lar labels in large surveys to what amounts to ﬁtting all labels
with a.i. model spectra simultaneously. The accommodation
of label correlation facilitates the extraction of abundance in-
formation from blended spectral features. For any given data
set this should allow higher precision and accuracy.

Of course, constructing PSMs is not a panacea: while a sin-
gle PSM appears to sufﬁce for the much of APOGEE survey,
this is presumably because APOGEE has targeted stars in a
rather restricted portion of label space: giant stars in a narrow
temperature range. Yet, even there, constructing a separate
PSM for the metal-poor regime may be advisable. Second, it
is probably worth exploring the PSM approach to higher or-
der in at least some of the labels. Perhaps most importantly,
any ﬁtting based on a.i. spectral models can only work as well
as the physics behind them. Insufﬁcient atomic data or the re-
strictions of the LTE approximation remain untouched by the
ideas laid out here. Nonetheless, we feel that T16 and this
paper lay out a path that may help in doing justice to the enor-
mous information content of present and future stellar spec-
troscopy surveys.
