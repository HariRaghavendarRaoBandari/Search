Stability for a magnetic Schr¨odinger operator on

a Riemann surface with boundary

Joel Andersson

Leo Tzou

March 4, 2016

Abstract

We consider a magnetic Schr¨odinger operator (∇X )∗∇X + q on a com-
pact Riemann surface with boundary and prove a log log-type stability
estimate in terms of Cauchy data for the electric potential and magnetic
ﬁeld under the assumption that they satisfy appropriate a priori bounds.
We also give a similar stability result for the holonomy of the connection
1-form X.

Introduction

Let (M, g) be a compact Riemann surface with boundary ∂M . We will consider
a connection ∇X on a complex line bundle over M , with connection 1-form X.
By the associated connection Laplacian we mean the diﬀerential operator

∆X := (∇X )∗∇X = (d + iX)∗(d + iX) = − ⋆ (d ⋆ +iX ∧ ⋆)(d + iX),

where d denotes the exterior derivative, i = √−1 and ⋆ is the Hodge star with

respect to the metric g. In particular, when X is real valued, ∆X is often called
the magnetic Laplacian associated with the magnetic ﬁeld dX. We will restrict
our attention to the case of real-valued X in this work.

(1.1)

By adding a complex-valued potential q we get the magnetic Schr¨odinger

operator associated with the couple (X, q)

L = LX,q := ∆X + q.

(1.2)

We denote by H s(M ) the Sobolev space containing functions on M with s
derivatives in L2(M ). The Cauchy data space CL of L is deﬁned by
ν u)|∂M ∈ H 1/2(∂M ) × H−1/2(∂M ); u ∈ H 1(M ), Lu = 0}, (1.3)
CL := {(u,∇X
where ν denotes the outward pointing unit normal vector ﬁeld to ∂M and
∇X
ν u := (∇X u)(ν) is the normal derivative associated with X.
In this work we assume that we are working with two diﬀerent magnetic
Schr¨odinger operators Lj := LXj ,qj and their corresponding Cauchy data spaces
Cj := CLj , j = 1, 2. Assuming certain a priori bounds for the norms of Xj and
qj, we illustrate that if the Cauchy data spaces are suﬃciently similar, then so
are the qj:s and Xj:s respectively. The main results of this paper are:

1

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that q1, q2 are complex-valued functions and X1, X2 are
real-valued 1-forms such that for some p > 2,

kqjkW 1,p(M) ≤ K,

kXjkW 2,p(T ∗M) ≤ K,

j = 1, 2.

(1.4)

Denote by Cj := CLj the Cauchy data spaces as deﬁned in (1.3) for the corre-
sponding magnetic Schr¨odinger operators Lj := LXj ,qj , as deﬁned in (1.1)-(1.2).
Then if the distance d(C1,C2) is small enough, there is an α > 0 such that

kq1 − q2kL2(M) + kd(X1 − X2)kL2(Λ2(M)) ≤

where C = C(K, M, α).

By interpolation it is then also quite immediate to deduce:

Corollary 1.2. If in addition to the assumptions in Theorem 1.1 we have for
some k ≥ 3

kqjkHk(M) ≤ K,
Then there is an α > 0 such that

kXjkHk(T ∗M) ≤ K,

j = 1, 2.

where C = C(K, M, β), 0 ≤ s < k.

These results further quantify the uniqueness results by Guillarmou and
Tzou from 2011, [7]. They showed that the Cauchy data of the magnetic
Schr¨odinger operator LX,q uniquely determines the potential q and uniquely
determines the connection X up to so-called gauge isomorphism. This result
was extended, by the same authors together with Albin and Uhlmann [1], to
identiﬁcation of coeﬃcients (up to gauge) in elliptic systems in 2013. We have
borrowed plenty of notations and conventions from these works.

The main idea in [7] is to rewrite Lju = 0 to ¯∂-systems with matrix-valued
potentials, and then apply the idea by Bukhgeim [2]. In the identiﬁability case,
one is able to do this due to certain orthogonality condition on the boundary
which allows one to judiciously choose conjugation factors so that they agree
on the boundary.
In this work the orthogonality condition will only be an
approximate one and we quantify the boundary conditions of the conjugation
factors by this approximate orthogonality condition (see Section 5). This process
unfortunately causes the extra logarithm in the end result.

Another additional feature which we must consider is the uniformity of the
estimates in the stationary phase expansion. As such we must construct slightly
diﬀerent phase functions than in [7] to be used in these solutions and reﬁne
several estimates from mentioned works. This work is done in Section 2.

To see that the Cauchy data space cannot determine the couple (X, q) com-
pletely, consider introducing a real-valued function f (say in H 2(M )) whose
restriction to the boundary ∂M is zero. Then the Cauchy data spaces associ-
ated with the magnetic Schr¨odinger operators LX,q and LX+df,q can be seen to
coincide.

2

In [7] it is shown that the Cauchy data space determines the relative coho-
mology class of X. This is done through a number of steps. First by showing
that C1 = C2 implies that d(X1− X2) = 0 and q1 = q2. If M is simply connected
this would imply that X1 and X2 diﬀer by an exact 1-form. Furthermore, by
boundary determination, ι∗∂M (X1 − X2) = 0, where ι∗∂M denotes pullback by
inclusion to the boundary. In the case of a more general Riemann surface, not
necessarily simply connected, there are further obstructions so that X1 and X2
may no longer only diﬀer by an exact 1-form. Namely, if E is a complex line
bundle over M and there is a so-called unitary bundle isomorphism F : E → E
that preserves the Hermitian inner product and satisﬁes ∇X1 = F ∗∇X2 F with
F = Id on E|∂M it can again be seen that C1 = C2. Having such a unitary bundle
isomorphism corresponds to multiplication by a function F on M with the prop-
erties |F| = 1 and F|∂M = 1. This is again equivalent with ι∗∂M (X1 − X2) = 0
on ∂M , d(X1 − X2) = 0 and that all periods of X1 − X2 is an integer multiple
of 2π. I.e. for every closed loop γ in M it holds that

Zγ

(X1 − X2) ∈ 2πZ.

(1.8)

In this case one can deduce that

X1 − X2 = df + 2π

where nk ∈ Z, {ωk}N
k=1 which is a basis for the ﬁrst relative cohomology
H 1(M, ∂M ), dual to {γj}N
j=1 which are some non-homotopically equivalent
loops on M , f is a function whose restriction to the boundary ∂M is zero
and δjk is the usual Kronecker delta.

In our framework we quantify the above statement by showing:

Theorem 1.3. There is an α > 0 such that if d(C1,C2) is small enough, then
for every closed loop γ in M it holds that

where C = C(K, M, p, α).

The above result is a consequence of Theorem 1.1 and the Picard-Lindel¨of
Theorem. Some precaution is needed when deﬁning relevant functions on M
since in our case X1 − X2 is not necessarily closed, compare with [7]. This
introduces extra complications and a suitable expression for X1 − X2 is derived
to quantify its distance from an exact gauge (see Section 6).
We also refer to [8] for more background on the Calder´on inverse problem
for Schr¨odinger operators in dimension 2. In particular, [5] proves uniqueness
for the usual Schr¨odinger operator ∆g + q on a Riemann surface and [6] handles
the corresponding partial data case. For similar results in Euclidean domains,
see [15, 12, 11]. Related stability estimates can also be found in [16, 17]. A con-
structive method for the reconstructing an isotropic conductivity on a Riemann
surface was ﬁrst obtained in [9].

2 A primer on Riemann surfaces

We aim here to give only a brief introduction to the geometry of compact Rie-
mann surfaces and refer to the books [3, 4, 13] for more comprehensive treat-
ments.

For a closed Riemann surface (M, g) we denote by Λk(M ), k = 0, 1, 2 the
bundles of complex-valued k-forms on M . In particular, Λ0(M ) contains func-
tions on M and Λ1(M ) = CT ∗M is the complexiﬁed cotangent bundle on M ,
containing 1-forms.

The Hodge star induces a natural splitting (in the sense of vector spaces) of

the cotangent bundle

Λ1(M ) = Λ1,0(M ) ⊕ Λ0,1(M ),

where Λ1,0(M ) = T ∗1,0M := ker(⋆ + i) and Λ0,1(M ) = T ∗0,1M := ker(⋆ − i)
are eigenspaces to ⋆ corresponding to it’s eigenvalues ±i. We say that a 1-
form belonging to Λp,q(M ) is of type (p, q) ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 1)}. In holomorphic
coordinates, z = x+i y in a chart (U, φ), the Hodge star ⋆ : Λk(M ) → Λ2−k(M ),
acts according to:

⋆(u dz + v d¯z) = −i u dz + i v d¯z,

where u, v are functions. So locally Λ1,0(M ) is spanned by dz while Λ0,1(M ) is
spanned by d¯z. We have the natural projections

π1,0 : Λ1(M ) → Λ1,0(M ), ω 7→ ω1,0 = π1,0ω,
π0,1 : Λ1(M ) → Λ0,1(M ), ω 7→ ω0,1 = π0,1ω,

and by deﬁnition ⋆ω1,0 = −i ω1,0 and ⋆ω0,1 = i ω0,1.
cording to

A Hermitian inner product can be deﬁned on the vector space Λk(M ) ac-

hλ, ηiL2(Λk(M)) :=ZM

λ ∧ ⋆¯η,

λ, η ∈ Λk(M ).

(2.1)

We will often assume that our functions and forms belong to certain Sobolev
spaces. Recall that for non-negative integers k and 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, a function f is
said to belong to the Sobolev space W k,p(M ) if it is k times weakly diﬀerentiable
and all partial derivatives up to order k belong to Lp(M ). For k = 2 we use
the common notation H k(M ) := W k,2(M ), or H s(M ) when considering non-
integers s = k, and for k = 0 we have Lp(M ) = W 0,p(M ). For a more thorough
discussion on Sobolev spaces we refer to e.g. Section 1.3 of [18], that also covers
the spaces W k,p(Λl(M )) that we also consider in the cases l = 1, 2.

2.1 Cauchy-Riemann operators on M
Next we will introduce the Cauchy Riemann operators ∂, ¯∂ as mappings of k-
forms to (k + 1)-forms, k = 0, 1.

On functions their action is deﬁned by

∂f := π1,0df,

¯∂f := π0,1df.

In holomorphic coordinates this is simply

∂f := ∂zf dz,

¯∂f := ∂¯zf d¯z,

4

where

∂z =

1

2(cid:18) ∂

∂x − i

∂

∂y(cid:19) ,

∂¯z =

1

2(cid:18) ∂

∂x

+ i

∂

∂y(cid:19)

are the usual Wirtinger derivatives. The space of holomorphic functions over
M is denoted by H(M ) and consists of functions f that satisfy ¯∂f = 0.

On 1-forms we deﬁne

∂ω := dπ0,1ω = dω0,1,

¯∂ω := dπ1,0ω = dω1,0.

In coordinates this is

∂(u dz + v d¯z) = ∂v ∧ d¯z,

¯∂(u dz + v d¯z) = ¯∂u ∧ dz.

It is clear that d = ∂ + ¯∂ holds for both functions and 1-forms. The adjoints of
∂ and ¯∂ are simply given by ∂∗ = i ⋆ ¯∂ and ¯∂∗ = −i ⋆ ∂ respectively. We can
now deﬁne the Laplacian of a function f on M by
∆f := −2i ⋆ ¯∂∂f = δdf

where δ = d∗ is the codiﬀerential, i.e. the adjoint of d with respect to the inner
product, and the ⋆ is the induced Hodge star that maps 2-forms to 0-forms.

2.2 Existence of suitable phase functions on M

We will now construct functions that are holomorphic and Morse, with uni-
formly bounded from below Hessian outside a neighborhood of their stationary
points. These functions will be used as phase functions in latter arguments that
allow us to estimate the degeneracy near stationary points. This must be taken
into account when deriving correct remainder estimates in e.g. stationary phase
expansions.

Start out with any Φ ∈ H(M ) which is Morse, meaning that if ˆp ∈ M is a
stationary point, ∂Φ(ˆp) = 0, then the Hessian ∂2
pΦ(ˆp) 6= 0. For the construction
of such functions see [5]. Suppose that {p1, . . . , pn} is the set of stationary
points of Φ and for k = 1, . . . , n denote by pj,k, j = 1, . . . , mk the set of points
for which the values Φ(pj,k) coincide with the critical values Φ(pk). Then we
have the following lemma:

Lemma 2.1. Let Φ be a holomorphic Morse function on a compact Riemann
surface M with boundary, having critical points {pk}n

k=1 ⊂ M , and let
Pcv = {pj,k ∈ M ; Φ(pj,k) = Φ(pk), j = 1, . . . , mk, k = 1, . . . , n}

be the set of points where the values of Φ coincides with a critical value. For
any δ > 0 we let Nδ be a neighborhood of Pcv deﬁned by:

Bj,k,δ, Bj,k,δ = φ−1(B(φ(pj,k), δ)),

Nδ =[j,k

where (U, φ) are charts such that φ : U → C and

B(φ(pj,k), δ) = {z ∈ C;|z − zj,k| < δ, zj,k = φ(pj,k)} ⊂ φ(U ).

5

Then for any ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ there exists a holomorphic Morse function Φ ˆp with a
critical point at ˆp such that at all critical points p of Φ ˆp there is a c > 0 such
that

|∂2
pΦ ˆp(p)| ≥ cδ4,

uniformly in ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ.
Proof. The sought after function will be deﬁned by

Φ ˆp(p) := (Φ(p) − Φ(ˆp))2,

ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ.

Then

∂Φ ˆp(p) = 2(Φ(p) − Φ(ˆp))∂Φ(p),

so clearly ∂Φ ˆp(ˆp) = 0, and we will show that Φ ˆp is Morse. Observe that, in a
coordinate system (U, φ) containing p = φ(z)

∂2
z Φ ˆp(φ−1(z)) = 2(∂zΦ(φ−1(z)))2 + 2(Φ(φ−1(z)) − Φ(ˆp))∂2

z Φ(φ−1(z)).

Suppose that p ∈ M is a point such that

0 = ∂Φ ˆp(p) = 2(Φ(p) − Φ(ˆp))∂Φ(p).

Then, since ˆp is bounded away from critical values of Φ, we have the following
two mutually exclusive cases

1. ∂Φ(p) = 0 in which case p = pk for some k ∈ {1, . . . , n} or,
2. Φ(p) = Φ(ˆp).

In case 1, we have with zk = φ(pk),

∂2
z Φ ˆp(φ−1(zk)) = 2(Φ(φ−1(zk)) − Φ(φ−1(ˆz)))∂2

z Φ(φ−1(zk)),

z Φ(φ−1(zk)) =
and since Φ is Morse there is a holomorphic chart in which ∂2
ak 6= 0. Also since ˆp /∈ Nδ, Φ(pk) − Φ(ˆp) 6= 0 and furthermore (for small enough
δ > 0 and ˆp close enough to pk) we have in local coordinates,

|Φ(φ−1(zk)) − Φ(φ−1(ˆz))| = |ak||zk − ˆz|2 + O(|zk − ˆz|3).

(Observe that |Φ(pk) − Φ(ˆp)| → 0 only if ˆp → pj,k for some pj,k ∈ Pcv, and thus
|Φ(pk)− Φ(ˆp)| = |Φ(pk)− Φ(pj,k) + Φ(pj,k)− Φ(ˆp)| = |Φ(pj,k)− Φ(ˆp)|.) Since we
only have ﬁnitely many critical points we can thus choose an a > 0, such that
in a coordinate where p = φ(z)

z Φ ˆp(φ−1(z))| > aδ2,
|∂2

for all ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ, for p ∈ M : ∂Φ(p) = 0.

In case 2, when Φ(p) = Φ(ˆp) it follows that p 6= pk for any k, since ˆp /∈ Nδ.
Furthermore,

z Φ ˆp(φ−1(z)) = 2(∂zΦ(φ−1(z)))2.
∂2

Clearly the right hand side approaches 0 only when p → pk for some k ∈
{1, . . . , n} and we have by a similar argument as in case 1 that

|z − zk| ≥

1
c|Φ(φ−1(z)) − Φ(φ−1(zk))| =

1
c|Φ(φ−1(ˆz)) − Φ(φ−1(zk))|

= |ak||ˆz − zk|2 + O(|ˆz − zk|3)

c

,

6

where c > 0 is the Lipschitz constant for Φ◦φ−1. So the lower bound |ˆz−zk| ≥ δ
will yield a lower bound on |z − zk| & δ2, hence near pk we have (in local
coordinates)

|∂zΦ(φ−1(z))| = 2|ak||z − zk| + O(|z − zk|2) ≥

√b|ˆz − zk|2 = √bδ2.

Thus for p near pk we can again choose b > 0 such that

|∂2
z Φ ˆp(φ−1(z))| > bδ4,

for all ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ, for p ∈ M : Φ(p) = Φ(ˆp),

and this holds uniformly in ˆp ∈ M \ Nδ.
Remark 2.2. When the Riemann surface M is of a particularly simple type,
e.g. if it is a equipped with a global holomorphic coordinate z (such as when M
is just a domain in C) we do not need the construction in the above lemma.
Since in the latter case it holds that for every ˆz = φ(ˆp), Φ(z) = (z − ˆz)2 is a
Morse holomorphic function with a critical point at ˆz.

We are going to use the method of stationary phase with the above con-
structed phase function in order to later derive estimates. For convenience we
replace δ by √δ in the above lemma, i.e. we consider the phase function Φ = Φ ˆp
pΦ ˆp| ≥ cδ2. Recall that C∞0 as usual denotes smooth and
on M \ N√δ, where |∂2
compactly supported functions/form. The dependence on the parameters h and
δ will be important.

Lemma 2.3 (Stationary phase). Suppose ψ is a smooth function and K ⊂ C
z ψ(ˆz)| ≥ δ2 > 0.
is a set containing only one critical point ˆz of ψ and that |∂2

Proof. This follows from [10], Theorem 7.7.5.

2.3 The inverses of ∂ and ¯∂

Section 2 in [7] contain lemmas regarding the construction and boundedness of
right inverses of the Cauchy-Riemann operators. These results ensures that the
constructed solutions to the Dirac-systems that are considered in the paper are
well-behaved. As we will use a very similar approach in Section 3, we recite
some of these essential lemmas below.

Lemma 2.4 (Right inverse to ¯∂, [7]). There exists an operator

¯∂−1 : C∞0 (Λ1,0(M )) → C∞(M )

such that

7

(i) ¯∂ ¯∂−1ω = ω for all ω ∈ C∞0 (Λ1,0(M )).
(ii) If χj ∈ C∞0 (M ) are supported in complex charts Uj, bi-holomorphic to a
bounded open set Ω ⊂ C with complex coordinate z, and such that χ =
P χj is equal to 1 on M , then as operators

(2.2)

¯∂−1χ =X ˆχj ¯T χj + K,

where ˆχj ∈ C∞0 (Uj) are such that ˆχjχj = χj, K has smooth kernel on
M × M and ¯T is given in the complex coordinate z ∈ Ui by

¯T (f d¯z) =

1

π ZC

f (ζ)
z − ζ

dζ ∧ d¯ζ.

(2.3)

(iii) ¯∂−1 is bounded from Lp(Λ1,0(M )) to W 1,p(M ) for all p > 1.

So by (ii), the inverse can be expressed by the usual Cauchy operator, which
is called ¯T here, plus a smoothing term, in local coordinates. A similar result
for ¯∂∗ is given by
Lemma 2.5 (Right inverse to ¯∂∗, [7]). Let ¯∂∗ : W 1,p(Λ0,1(M )) → Lp(M ), then
there exists an operator

¯∂∗−1 : C∞0 (M ) → C∞(Λ0,1(M ))

such that
(i) ¯∂∗ ¯∂∗−1ϕ = ϕ for all ϕ ∈ C∞0 (M ).
(ii) If χj ∈ C∞0 (M ) are supported in complex charts Uj, bi-holomorphic to a
bounded open set Ω ⊂ C with complex coordinate z, and such that χ =
P χj is equal to 1 on M , then as operators

(2.4)

¯∂∗−1χ =X ˆχjT χj + K,

where ˆχj ∈ C∞0 (Uj) are such that ˆχjχj = χj, K has smooth kernel on
M × M and T is given in the complex coordinate z ∈ Ui by

T f (z) =(cid:18) 1

π ZC

f (ζ)
¯z − ¯ζ

dζ ∧ d¯ζ(cid:19) d¯z.

(2.5)

(iii) ¯∂∗−1 is bounded from Lp(M ) to W 1,p(Λ0,1(M )) for all p > 1.

Here we again observe that (ii) says that the inverse can be expressed as
a Cauchy-type operator plus a smoothing term, in local coordinates. For the
proof we again refer to [7]. The main use of Lemma 2.4 and 2.5 in [7] is to
prove Lemma 2.6 and 2.8. We could also make use of Lemma 2.4 and 2.5 in
order to prove estimates for the solutions of the ¯∂-systems we will consider in
later sections. In order to prove Theorem 1.1 we will require more reﬁned and
explicit estimates than what is needed in order to prove identiﬁability of the
pair (X, q), so this is another reason for restating also the above lemmas.

8

Let us now assume that M is strictly contained in some larger surface N .
Suppose p, q ∈ [1,∞] and deﬁne the continuous extension operator from M to
N by

E : W k,p(Λ0,1(M )) → W k,p

c

(Λ0,1(N )),

where W k,p
(Λ0,1(N )) denotes the subspace of compactly supported type (0, 1)-
forms in W k,p(Λ0,1(N )), k = 1, 2, with a range made of type (0, 1)-forms with
support in Nδ = {n ∈ N ; d(n, ¯M ) ≤ δ} for some δ > 0. We also denote by

the restriction map from N to M .

R : Lq(N ) → Lq(M )

ψ ωkLq(M) ≤ Ch1/qkωkW 1,p(Λ0,1(M)),

1 ≤ q < 2,
2 ≤ q ≤ p.

(2.6)

(2.7)

By interpolation, there is thus an ε > 0 and C > 0 such that for all ω ∈
W 1,p(Λ0,1(M ))

k ¯∂−1

ψ ωkL2(M) ≤ Ch1/2+εkωkW 1,p(Λ0,1(M)).

(2.8)

As we will be required to use the special phase functions constructed in
Lemma 2.1 we state below a more explicit version of the above lemma in order
to see the δ-dependence.

Lemma 2.7 (Reﬁnement of Lemma 2.2 from [7]). Let Φ ˆp be a holomorphic
ψ := R ¯∂−1e−2iψ/hE
Morse function as in Lemma 2.1 and let ψ = Im Φ ˆp. Deﬁne ¯∂−1
where ¯∂−1 is the right inverse of ¯∂ : W 1,p(M ) → Lp(Λ0,1(M )). Let p > 2, then
there are constants ε > 0, C > 0 independent of h and ˆp such that for all
ω ∈ W 1,p(Λ0,1(M )),

k ¯∂−1

ψ ωkL2(M) ≤

Ch1/2+ε

δ4

kωkW 1,p(Λ0,1(M)).

Proof. The proof is identical to that of Lemma 2.2 in [7], with the addition that
Lemma 2.1 is applied when doing estimates of

1

| ¯∂ψ| ≤

c

δ2|z − ˆz|

near a critical point z0. One observes that there will be no terms in which the δ-
dependence is worse than δ−4 (using also part 1 of Lemma 2.3 when estimating
the smoothing part of ¯∂−1).

The ﬁnal lemma of this section follows Lemma 2.6, and is proved in exactly
the same way, but for a corresponding ¯∂∗−1
ψ . Here the restriction and exten-
sion operators must be interpreted in a diﬀerent way, namely that R′ restricts
sections of Λ0,1(N ) to M and E′ is a continuous extension from W k,p(M ) to
W k,p

(N ), k = 0, 1 where the functions in its range are supported in some Nδ.

Inverse boundary problems for systems

Our approach mimic the idea of Bukhgeim [2] that makes it possible to study a
ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator represented by a matrix instead of (1.2).

¯∂-system

The idea is to consider the bundle Σ(M ) := Λ0(M ) ⊕ Λ0,1(M ) and the
(3.1)

(D + V )U = 0,

where

D =(cid:20) 0

¯∂

¯∂∗

0 (cid:21) ,

V =(cid:20) Q+ A′

A Q− (cid:21) , U =(cid:18) u

ω0,1 (cid:19) ∈ Σ(M ).

The operator D is often called a Dirac operator and is formally self-adjoint.
The potential V will be built up by functions Q± on the diagonal and 1-forms
A, A′ on the antidiagonal. The action of V on Σ(M ) must be interpreted in the
correct way, e.g. in our case it will be of the form

V =(cid:20) Q ⋆( ¯A ∧ ·)
−1

A

(cid:21) , A ∈ Λ0,1(M ).

10

Hence

V U =(cid:18) Qu + ⋆ ¯A ∧ ω0,1
uA − ω0,1

(cid:19) .

In [7] it is assumed that V is a diagonal endomorphism of Σ(M ). This
condition was relaxed in [1] and we will mainly follow the methodology of this
work in this section.

The inner products on Λ0(M ) and Λ1(M ) induce a natural inner product

on Σ(M ) as

where the two inner products in the right hand side are deﬁned by (2.1).

h·,·iL2(Σ(M)) := h·,·iL2(M) + h·,·iL2(Λ1(M))

(3.2)

We will make use of the following boundary integral identity, which is easily

proved by integration by parts.

Lemma 3.1. Suppose that U′ is a solution to the system (D + V ∗)U′ = 0 in
M . Then

where

h(D + V )U, U′iL2(Σ(M)) = hU, U′i∂M ,
hU, U′i∂M :=Z∂M
ι∗∂M(cid:16)u ⋆ ω′0,1 − ⋆ω0,1u′(cid:17) .

In the above, ι∗∂M denotes pullback by inclusion and

U =(cid:18) u

ω0,1 (cid:19) , U′ =(cid:18) u′

ω′0,1 (cid:19) .

Our goal will be to reduce to the case when V is in fact diagonal. This
is the situation ﬁrst studied by Bukhgeim in the planar case in [2], laying the
foundation to the manifold version in Proposition 2.5 in [1]. In our case, due
to the modiﬁed phase function Φ that we must resort to, our version of that
proposition reads:

Proposition 3.2. Let Φ ˆp be a holomorphic Morse function as in Lemma 2.1.

1. If

V =(cid:20) ˜Q 0

˜F (cid:21) ,

0

˜Q ∈ L∞(M ), ˜F ∈ W 1,p(M ),

for some p > 2, then there exist solutions to (D + V )Fh = 0 on M of the
form

Fh =(cid:18)

eΦ ˆp rh

e ¯Φ ˆp (b + sh), (cid:19)

for any anti-holomorphic one form b and so that for some ε > 0

krhkL2(M) + kshkL2(M) ≤

Ch1/2+ε

δ4

.

(3.3)

2. If instead ˜Q ∈ W 1,p(M ) for some p > 2 and ˜F ∈ L∞(M ), then there

exists solutions to (D + V )Gh = 0 on M of the form

Gh =(cid:18) eΦ ˆp (a + rh)

e ¯Φ ˆp sh,

(cid:19)

for any holomorphic function a and so that for some ε > 0, (3.3) still
hold.

11

Sketch of proof. The proof closely resembles the one Proposition 2.5 in [7] but
makes use of the reﬁned Lemma 2.7 (or similar) instead of Lemma 2.2 in [7]
(and it’s variants respectively). There are some details that we in particular
would like to highlight.

We make use of that the mentioned lemmas contain very explicit expressions
for the remainder terms rh ∈ Λ0(M ), sh ∈ Λ0,1(M ). It can be seen, as in [7],
that the remainder terms must solve the system

(rh + ¯∂−1

sh + ¯∂∗−1

ψ ( ˜F sh) = − ¯∂−1
ψ ( ˜Qrh) = − ¯∂∗−1

ψ ( ˜F b)
ψ ( ˜Qa).

(3.4)

In the case ˜Q ∈ L∞(M ), ˜F ∈ W 1,p(M ) we can choose a = 0 and it follows that
rh must satisfy

(I − Sh)rh = − ¯∂−1

ψ ( ˜F b), Sh := ¯∂−1

ψ

˜F ¯∂∗−1

ψ

˜Q.

(3.5)

The idea is now to solve through a Neumann series. From Lemma 2.6 and 2.8
it follows that kShkL2→L2 = O(h1/2−ε), 0 < ε < 1/2, c.f. Lemma 2.4 in [1]. We
remark that also this result (or the corresponding Lemma 3.1 in [7]) must be
modiﬁed slightly. However, as we will later require that hεδ−7/2 to be small for
some (preferebly as large as possible) 0 < ε < 1/2. This will ensure that the
bound:

Ch1/2−ε

kShkL2→L2 ≤

δ4

still makes the Neumann series argument valid. Furthermore we may establish
the estimate (3.3) in an analogous way. So we can solve equation (3.5) for small
h,

rh = −

Xj=0

˜F b.

(3.6)

The above rh ∈ Lq(M ) for any q ≥ 2 and substituting this solution into the
equation for sh in (3.4) we get

sh = − ¯∂∗−1

ψ ( ˜Qrh).

(3.7)

Now another application of Lemma 2.6 and 2.8 gives the L2-estimates in Propo-
sition 3.2. The case of ˜Q ∈ W 1,p(M ), ˜F ∈ L∞(M ) is proved by a similar
argument after choosing b = 0.

3.1 The distance between Cauchy data for systems

We would like to compare the Cauchy data for diﬀerent potentials V1, V2 in a
meaningful and quantitative manner. One standard method is to use a pseudo-
distance inspired by the so-called Hausdorﬀ distance.

Recall the deﬁnition of the Cauchy data spaces CLj , as in (1.3). Assuming

that uj ∈ H k(M ) solves

(Ljuj = 0,
uj|∂M = fj,

12

(3.8)

for fj ∈ H k−1/2(∂M ), for some k ≥ 1. Then ∇Xj
we may consider a norm on CLj deﬁned by,

ν uj = gj ∈ H k−3/2(∂M ) and

k(fj, gj)kHs(∂M)⊕Hs−1(∂M) := kfjkHs(∂M) + kgjkHs−1(∂M),

s ≥ 1/2.

Then we set, for (fj, gj) ∈ CLj ,

d((f1, g1), (f2, g2)) := k(f1, g1) − (f2, g2)kHs(∂M)⊕Hs−1(∂M)

kf1kHs(∂M)

and deﬁne

d(CL1,CL2) := max(sup

CL1

inf
CL2

d((f1, g1), (f2, g2)), sup
CL2

inf
CL1

d((f2, g2), (f1, g1))) .

Correspondingly for the system formulation, we think of the Cauchy data
CV is made up of boundary values ι∗∂M (u, ⋆ω)T for H k-solutions U = (u, ω)T to
(D + V )U = 0. We may consider CV being a subset of H s(∂M ) ⊕ H s−1(∂M ),
whose norm we can use to introduce a distance when considering two potentials.
Suppose we have two traces, (fj, λj )T ∈ CVj , j = 1, 2, then we can consider the
quantity

d∂M ((f1, λ1), (f2, λ2)) := k(f1, λ1) − (f2, λ2)kHs(Σ(∂M))

kf1kHs(∂M)

.

The H s(Σ(∂M ))-norm is deﬁned, for s ≥ 1/2, by
k(f, λ)kHs(Σ(∂M)) := kfkHs(∂M) + kλkHs−1(Λ1(∂M)), U = (f, λ)T ∈ Σ(∂M ).
Then we can deﬁne a distance between Cauchy data as

d′(CV1,CV2 )

= max(sup

CV1

inf
CV2

d∂M ((f1, λ1), (f2, λ2)), sup
CV2

inf
CV1

d∂M ((f2, λ2), (f1, λ1))) .

Proposition 3.3. If (D+Vj )Uj = 0 are the system formulations of the problems
Ljuj = 0, then

d′(CV1 ,CV2) ≤ d(CL1 ,CL2).

Proof. Pick any (fj, gj) ∈ CLj , then fj = uj|∂M , gj = ∇Xj
ν uj|∂M where uj ∈
H k(M ) solves Ljuj = 0. Then the corresponding solutions Uj = (uj, ωj) to
(D +Vj)Uj = 0 has Cauchy data (uj|∂M , ι∗∂M ⋆ωj) = (uj|∂M , ι∗∂M π0,1∇Xj uj(ν)).
So clearly,

kι∗∂M ⋆ ωjkHk−3/2(Λ1(∂M)) ≤ k∇Xj

ν uj|∂MkHk−3/2(∂M),

so d∂M ((f1, ι∗∂M ⋆ ω1), (f2, ι∗∂M ⋆ ω2)) ≤ d((f1, g1), (f2, g2)).

We will from now on use the notation d(C1,C2) = d(CL1 ,CL2) and not bother
much with estimates that could be expressed with d′(CV1,CV2 ) instead. However,
we will still need the deﬁnition of d′ when we later will solve a diagonalized

13

version of the problems (D + Vj )Uj = 0 and in that case Proposition 3.3 will
become weaker.

Furthermore, we will from now on only consider the case when k = 1 (or

s = 1/2), in which case

d((f1, g1), (f2, g2)) = kf1 − f2kH 1/2(∂M) + kg1 − g2kH−1/2(∂M)

,

d∂M ((f1, λ1), (f2, λ2)) = kf1 − f2kH 1/2(∂M) + kλ1 − λ2kH−1/2(Λ1(∂M))

.

kf1kH 1/2(∂M)

kf1kH 1/2(∂M)

4 System reduction and estimates

Suppose now that we are given two magnetic Schr¨odinger operators Lj :=
LXj ,qj , j = 1, 2. Introduce Aj := π0,1Xj, Bj := π1,0Xj, where π0,1 and π1,0
are the projections discussed in Section 2. We ﬁrst observe that we can rewrite
Lj from the form (1.2) into

Lj = −2i ⋆ (∂ + i ¯Aj∧)( ¯∂ + iAj) + Qj, Qj = − ⋆ dXj + qj.

(4.1)

If αj are primitive functions in the sense that ¯∂αj = Aj (the existence of such
αj is guaranteed by Lemma 2.4), then we can furthermore rewrite (4.1) (using
integrating factor) to

Lj = 2e−i ¯αj ¯∂∗ei ¯αj e−iαj ¯∂eiαj + Qj.

(4.2)

In order to abbreviate, let us denote by Fj = eiαj , then we can once again
rewrite (4.2) as

Lj = 2 ¯Fj ¯∂∗ ¯F −1

j F −1

j

¯∂Fj + Qj, Qj = − ⋆ dXj + qj .

(4.3)

Introducing ω = ( ¯∂ + iAj)u we see that we can rewrite the second order

partial diﬀerential equations Lju = 0 as the ﬁrst order ¯∂-system

(cid:20) Qj/2 −i ⋆ (∂ + i ¯Aj ∧ ·)

¯∂ + iAj

or equivalently

ω (cid:19) =(cid:18) 0

0 (cid:19) .

(4.4)

Using notations from Section 3 we can abbreviate (4.4) by (D + Vj)U = 0. By
a similar argument leading to the form (4.3) of Lj we can also observe that we
can split the system (4.4) further into (c.f. [1])

˜ω (cid:19) =(cid:18) Fj u

¯F −1

˜ω (cid:19) =(cid:18) 0

0 (cid:19) ,

(4.5)

Denoting the potential matrix in (4.5) by ˜Vj, the system can be abbreviated as
(D + ˜Vj) ˜U = 0. Now we are in the case discussed above, with diagonal potential
matrices, that was treated by Bukhgeim.

Suppose now that we have a solution to (D + ˜V1) ˜U 1

h = 0, then by Proposition

3.2 we can assume that the solution has the form

˜U 1

h =(cid:18) eΦ/h(a + r1

e ¯Φ/hs1
h

h)

(cid:19) .

It follows that a solution to (D + V1)U 1

h = 0 can be found on the form

U 1

h =(cid:18) F −1

1 eΦ/h(a + r1
h)

¯F1e ¯Φ/hs1
h

(cid:19) ,

(4.6)

where a is an arbitrary holomorphic function.

Similarly, a solution to (D + V ∗2 )U 2

h = (D + V2)U 2

h = 0 can be found on the

form

U 2

h =(cid:18) F −1

2 e−Φ/hr2
h
¯F2e− ¯Φ/h(b + s2

h) (cid:19) .

(4.7)

Suppose now that Uh is a solution to (D + V2)Uh = 0, and U 1

h, U 2

h are the

solutions described above. Then by Lemma 3.1

h(D + V2)U 1

h, U 2

hiL2(Σ(M)) = h(D + V2)(U 1

h − Uh), U 2

hiL2(Σ(M))
= hU 1

h − Uh, U 2

hi∂M .

At the same time it is also true that

h(D + V2)U 1

h, U 2

hiL2(Σ(M)) = h(V2 − V1)U 1

h, U 2

hiL2(Σ(M)).

So we have derived the boundary integral identity
hiL2(Σ(M)) = hU 1

h(V2 − V1)U 1

h, U 2

h − Uh, U 2

hi∂M ,

(4.8)

(4.9)

from which we will derive an estimate in order to compare Cauchy data for the
potential matrices Vj and their diagonalized counterparts ˜Vj , in the sense of
(4.4)-(4.5). First we show the following auxiliary estimate.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that there is a constant K > 0 such that for some p > 2,

max{kqjkW 1,p(M),kXjkW 2,p(Λ1(M))} ≤ K.

(4.10)

and consider the systems corresponding to the problems Lju = 0 as described in
(4.4). Then the boundary integral identity (4.9) implies the following inequality
for small h > 0, δ > 0:

where C = C(K, M, p), c > 0, Aj = π0,1Xj, d(C1,C2) is the distance between
Cauchy data for the problems Lju = 0 and a, b, Fj are the quantities deﬁned
above appearing in the solutions U j

h, j = 1, 2 of the systems.

Remark 4.2. Let us ﬁrst remark on the a priori estimate (4.10). Under the
assumptions

Aj ∈ C1+r ∩ W s,p(Λ0,1(M )),
Qj ∈ W 1,q(M ),

q > 2,

p > 1, r + s > 1, r /∈ N, sp > 4,

(4.12)

(4.13)

we will have that ˜Vj ∈ W 1,q(End(Σ(M ))), c.f. [1].

Furthermore, the assumption

max{kqjkW 1,p(M),kXjkW 2,p(Λ1(M))} ≤ K,

for some

p > 2.

implies in particular that

max{kQjkW 1,p(M),kAjkW 1,p(Λ0,1(M))} ≤ K

(4.14)

holds. Then by Sobolev embedding and elliptic regularity (for ¯∂, see e.g. Theo-
rem 4.6.9 in [14]), it follows that

max{kQjkL∞(M),kAjkL∞(Λ0,1(M))} ≤ K,
kαjkL∞(M) ≤ C0kAjkW 1,p(Λ0,1(M)) ≤ C0K ≤ C,

kFjkL∞(M) ≤ eC0K ≤ C, C = C(K, M, p).

(4.22)

The proof is ﬁnished by rearranging the terms in (4.9) and applying the triangle
inequality.

The next step is to estimate the Sobolev norms of the solutions appearing
in the right hand side of (4.22). This requires a quite detailed discussion but
will yield results that we will use more than once.

4.1 H 1-estimates of solutions to (D + V )U = 0
We will need to estimate solutions of systems (D + V )U = 0 in H 1-norm sense.
For the general (non-diagonal) potentials V , that we must consider, we saw that
solutions were given by (4.6) and (4.7). Our goal will be to establish:

Proposition 4.3. Let U1, U2 be the solutions given in Proposition 3.2 with
˜Q, ˜F ∈ W 1,p(M ), p > 2. Then there are constants c > 0, D = D(K, M, p) > 0
such that
(4.23)

max{kU1kH 1(M,Σ(M)),kU2kH 1(M,Σ(M))} ≤ Dec/h,

for small h > 0.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst recall what we mean with the H 1-norm of some U = (u, ω0,1)T ∈
Σ(M ).

L2(Λ1(M)) + k∇ω0,1k2

where we are free to choose the holomorphic function a and antiholomorphic
1-form b. We start by observing that there is a constant c > 0 so that

|e±Φ/h| ≤ ec/h,

since ϕ = Re Φ is harmonic. By the a priori assumptions on the Aj:s in (4.12)
and the discussion leading to (4.16), we will also have no trouble bounding the

ﬁrst order partial derivatives of the Fj by some constant depending on the a
priori bounding constant K.

We need to be a bit careful with the remainders rj

h. By studying the
system (3.4) and invoking elliptic regularity we can however see that we are in
no danger, assuming suﬃcient regularity on ˜Q, ˜F . Rewriting the system we see
that,

h, sj

(rh = − ¯∂−1
sh = − ¯∂∗−1

ψ ( ˜F (b + sh)),
ψ ( ˜Q(a + rh)).

Now it is more clear that the right hand side should belong to H 1(M ). To
get an estimate, observe that by writing out the operators as in Section 2,
ψ = R′ ¯∂∗−1e2iψ/hE′ we have (on M ) that for small
¯∂−1
ψ = R ¯∂−1e−2iψ/hE, ¯∂∗−1
enough h > 0 (by Lemma 2.4(i), 2.5(i) and Proposition 3.2),

k ¯∂rhkL2 = k ¯∂ ¯∂−1e−2iψ/hE( ˜F (b + sh))kL2 ≤ CK(kbkL2 + krhkL2) ≤ C,
k∂shkL2 = k∂ ¯∂∗−1e2iψ/hE′( ˜Q(a + rh))kL2 ≤ CK(kbkL2 + krhkL2) ≤ C.

Furthermore,

k∂rhkL2 = k∂ ¯∂−1e−2iψ/hE( ˜F (b + sh))kL2 ≤ CK(kbkL2 + krhkL2) ≤ C,
k ¯∂shkL2 = k ¯∂∂−1 ⋆ e2iψ/hE( ˜Q(a + rh))kL2 ≤ CK(kbkL2 + krhkL2) ≤ C.

since ∂ ¯∂−1, ¯∂∂−1 are bounded operators (related to the so-called Beurling trans-
form) on Lp(M ). In local coordinates the kernels are of Calder´on-Zygmund type,
modulo smoothing terms by Lemma 2.4 and 2.5, c.f. [19].

Remark 4.4. Continuing the argument in the above proof it is in fact also more
or less almost immediate that if ˜Q, ˜F ∈ W k,p(M ), k ≥ 1, p > 2, then

krhkHk(M) + kshkHk(M) = O(h1−k).

the last equality follows since b is antiholomorphic. Thus we have shown

where Cj is the Cauchy data associated with the operators Lj = LXj ,qj , as deﬁned
in (??), and a ∈ H(M ), b ∈ Λ0,1(M ).

Later we will choose δ = (log | log d(C1,C2)|)−ε′ for some ε′ < 1/2 + ε so that

(4.26) can be replaced by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with 0 < β < 1/2 + ε − ε′γ′ where γ′ > 0 can be choosen arbitrarily small. We
will from now on assume that this choice of δ has been made and use (4.27) in
place of (4.26) when referring to Lemma 4.5.

5 Reduction to diagonal system

One of the key observations in [1] is that if C1 = C2, then choosing a = 1

Z∂M

ι∗∂M(cid:0)F2F −1

1

⋆ b(cid:1) = 0.

(This is also a consequence of Lemma 4.5 of course.) The following lemma is
then used extensively:
Lemma 5.1 (Lemma 2.8 in [1]). A complex-valued function f ∈ H 1/2(∂M )
is the restriction of a holomorphic function if and only if for all 1-forms η ∈
C∞(M, Λ1,0(M )) satisfying ¯∂η = 0,

f ι∗∂M η = 0.

Z∂M

The proof can be found in [7] where the above result is contained in Lemma
4.1. One must show that the harmonic extension of f is actually holomorphic,
and this can be done by considering the so-called Hodge-Morrey decomposition
of (0, 1)-forms.

Using the above lemma, the authors are thus able to conclude that (F −1

2 F1)|∂M
is indeed the restriction of a holomorphic function. Hence they may reduce the
case of a general matrix potential Vj to the diagonalized case ˜Vj.

Clearly, we are not in the same situation here so we need to motivate a

similar reduction step in a slightly diﬀerent way.

19

5.1 Auxiliary estimate

Let us introduce the subspace

U = {ω = ι∗∂M

¯b; ¯∂b = 0, b ∈ Λ1(M )},

of X = H 1/2(Λ1(∂M )) (or H s(Λ1(∂M )), for any s ≥ 0) and argue abstractly
from the viewpoint of Hilbert space theory. Consider the following subspace of
the dual space X∗,

ker U := {x∗ ∈ X∗; x∗(x) = 0 for all x ∈ U}.

Take a Schauder basis {x∗n}∞n=1 such that ker U = span{x∗n}∞n=1 and a dual basis
{xn}∞n=1 (deﬁned by x∗n(xm) = δmn). Now we claim that

X = U ⊕ span{xn}∞n=1.

Indeed, suppose there is 0 6= x∗ ∈ X∗ is such that x∗(x) = 0 for all x ∈
U⊕span{xn}∞n=1. Then in particular x∗(xn) = 0 for all n ∈ N. Thus x∗ /∈ ker U ,
but at the same time we must have x∗(x) = 0 for all x ∈ U and thus x∗ ∈ ker U .
An obvious contradiction unless x∗ = 0. To see that it is indeed a direct sum,
pick x ∈ U ∩ span{xn}∞n=1, then x =P anxn ∈ U , but then 0 = x∗n(x) = an for
all n ∈ N.
Now take another Schauder basis {yn}∞n=1 such that span{yn}∞n=1 = U and
a dual basis {y∗n}∞n=1 ⊂ X∗, then we can in a very similar way show that

Introducing the projection

X∗ = ker U ⊕ span{y∗n}∞n=1.

we have by the above splitting of X∗ = H−1/2(Λ1(∂M )) that any linear func-
tional on X may be written

π : X∗ → ker U

Now we claim that

x∗ = πx∗ + (1 − π)x∗.

k(1 − π)x∗k = sup

kxk≤1|(1 − π)x∗(x)| = sup

kxk≤1
x∈U

|(1 − π)x∗(x)|.

This equality follows since (1−π)x∗(xn) = 0, n ∈ N since (1−π)x∗ ∈ span{y∗n}.
In particular, if we consider the linear functional

Af : H 1/2(Λ1(∂M )) → C, Af [ω] :=Z∂M

f ω,

f ∈ H−1/2(∂M ),

we can interpret Lemma 4.5 as

k(1 − π)(F2F −1

1

)|∂MkH−1/2(∂M) ≤

C

| log d(C1,C2)|β ,

since the operator norm of A(1−π)(F2F −1
equals the norm in the left hand
side by the argument above. Furthermore, by the a priori assumptions in (4.12)-
(4.17), we have for some δ′ > 0, and interpolation

)|∂M

1

k(1 − π)(F2F −1

1

)|∂MkHr (∂M) ≤

C

| log d(C1,C2)|γ(α,β) ,

20

where 0 < α < 1, 0 < γ(α, β) < (1 − α)β and r > 3/2.

Now we have arrived at a stage where we have

F2F −1

1 = (1 − π)F2F −1

1 + πF2F −1

1

and by Lemma 5.1 we know that
πF2F −1

1

|∂M = G|∂M ,

Thus

which is equivalent with

F2|∂M = F1(1 − π)F2F −1

1

¯∂G = 0.

|∂M + F1G|∂M

F2|∂M − ˜F1|∂M = F1(1 − π)F2F −1

1

|∂M ,

˜F1 = F1G.

Clearly it also holds that

¯∂ ˜F1 = iA1 ˜F1,

¯∂F2 = iA2F2

and by our calculations above and a priori assumptions on the Aj :s

k(F2 − ˜F1)|∂MkHr (∂M) ≤

C

| log d(C1,C2)|γ .

So by Sobolev embedding we can conclude the following lemma:
Lemma 5.2. Let ˜F1, F2 be as deﬁned above, then there is a 0 < γ ≤ 1/2 such
that
(5.1)

C

k(F2 − ˜F1)|∂MkC 1(∂M) ≤

| log d(C1,C2)|γ ,

where C = C(K, M, p) and d(C1,C2) measures the distance between the Cauchy
data spaces as deﬁned above.

5.2 An inequalty between Cauchy data

From (4.6)-(4.7) we see that solutions to systems (D + Vj )Uj = 0 is related to
the corresponding system (D + ˜Vj ) ˜Uj = 0 with diagonalized potentials ˜Vj (in
the sense described above) via

˜U1 =" ˜F1

¯˜F −1

The next lemma relates the distances for Cauchy data for the diagonalized po-
tential ˜Vj and the Cauchy data for the corresponding partial diﬀerential equa-
tions with the pairs (Xj, qj).

Lemma 5.3. Suppose that we have reduced the boundary value problems for
Ljuj = 0 to boundary value problems with diagonal potential matrices (D +
˜Vj) ˜Uj = 0 as above. Then the distance of Cauchy data corresponding to the
diagonalized problems is bounded in terms of the distance between Cauchy data
for the initial problem according to

1 ω1 − ¯F −1

2 ω2)kH−1/2(Λ1(∂M))

Starting with the ﬁrst term
k( ˜F1u1 − F2u2)|∂MkH 1/2(∂M) ≤ k ˜F1|∂MkC 1(∂M)k(u1 − u2)|∂MkH 1/2(∂M)

where the last inequality follows from Lemma 5.2. Similarly, the second term
satisﬁes

Adding (5.2) and (5.3) we get

≤ Ck((u1 − u2)|∂M , ι∗∂M ⋆ (ω1 − ω2))kH 1/2(Σ(∂M))

+ C k(u2|∂M , ι∗∂M ⋆ ω2)kH 1/2(Σ(∂M))

.

| log d(C1,C2)|γ

This implies that

k˜u2|∂MkH 1/2(∂M)

k((˜u1 − ˜u2)|∂M , ι∗∂M ⋆ (˜ω1 − ˜ω2))kH 1/2(Σ(∂M))
≤ C k((u1 − u2)|∂M , ι∗∂M ⋆ (ω1 − ω2))kH 1/2(Σ(∂M))

| log d(C1,C2)|γ! ,
since F −1
is bounded from below and kι∗∂M ⋆ω2kH−1/2(∂M) ≤ Cku2|∂MkH 1/2(∂M).
As we have a bijective correspondence between solutions to the Lj, Vj and ˜Vj
problems, it follows that

ku2|∂MkH 1/2(∂M)

d′(C ˜V1

,C ˜V2

) ≤ C(cid:18)d(C1,C2) +

1

| log d(C1,C2)|γ(cid:19)

which is what we wanted to prove.

The important conclusion of Lemma 5.3 is that small diﬀerences in Cauchy
data for the non-diagonalized Vj-case implies small diﬀerences in Cauchy data
for the diagonal counterparts. This will allow us to deduce stability by consid-
ering the latter case.

22

5.3 Estimates for the potential q and magnetic ﬁeld dX

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 (and 1.2). Recall our
a priori assumptions (1.4):

kqjkW 1,p(M) ≤ K,

kXjkW 2,p(T ∗M) ≤ K,

j = 1, 2.

If Cj are the Cauchy data spaces as deﬁned in (1.3) for the corresponding mag-
netic Schr¨odinger operators Lj := LXj ,qj , as deﬁned in (1.1)-(1.2). Then if the
distance d(C1,C2) is small enough, there is an α ∈ (0, 1/2) such that

kq1 − q2kL2(M) + kd(X1 − X2)kL2(Λ2(M)) ≤

C
logα log

d(C1,C2)

,

(5.4)

where C = C(K, M, α).

We will split up the proof into three parts, using our reduction to a diagonal

system as described in the above sections.

Suppose that ˜U 1

h, ˜U 2

h are the earlier constructed H 1-solutions to

(D + ˜V1) ˜U 1

h = 0,

(D + ˜V ∗2 ) ˜U 2

h = 0

respectively and that ˜Uh solves (D + ˜V2) ˜Uh = 0. By Lemma 3.1 we then have

h( ˜V2 − ˜V1) ˜U 1
To abbreviate we introduce

h, ˜U 2

hiL2(Σ( ¯M)) = h ˜U 1

h − ˜Uh, ˜U 2

hi∂M .

˜F (cid:21) =(cid:20) |F2|−2Q2/2 − |F1|−2Q1/2

˜V =(cid:20) ˜Q 0
−|F2|2 + |F1|2 (cid:21) = ˜V2 − ˜V1.
Lemma 5.4. For p0 ∈ M \ N√δ there is an ε > 0 (that can be chosen uniformly
with respect to p0) such that

0

0

max{| ˜Q(p0)|,| ˜F (p0)|} ≤

C

δ7(log(1/H))ε , where H = | log d(C1,C2)|−γ,

and C = C(K, M, p, γ, ε), δ > 0, 0 < γ ≤ 1/2.
Proof. We will consider two cases, ﬁrst when the solutions ˜U j

h are of the forms

From the discussion in Section 4 and Lemma 5.3, we also have the estimate

(5.10)

|h( ˜V2 − ˜V1) ˜U 1

(5.11)

where we recall that

H =

1

| log d(C1,C2)|γ ,

for some 0 < γ ≤ 1/2.

Combining either (5.6)-(5.7) or (5.9)-(5.10) with (5.11), we get

|Che2iψ(p0)/h ˜Q(p0)|a(p0)|2| ≤ C
|Dhe−2iψ(p0)/h ˜F (p0)|b(p0)|2| ≤ C

δ7 (h1+ε + ec/hH),
δ7 (h1+ε + ec/hH),

Equivalently,

max{| ˜Q(p0)|,| ˜F (p0)|} ≤

C
δ7 (hε + ec/hH).

(5.12)

Now, since we assume that H > 0 is very small, we can choose

and get from (5.12),

h = c((1 − ε) log(1/H))−1

max{| ˜Q(p0)|,| ˜F (p0)|} ≤

C

δ7(log(1/H))ε

(5.13)

24

for some large enough C = C(K, M, p, ε).

To justify (5.9) for the terms that are not immediately obvious we use ar-

gumets similar to those in [7], e.g.

ZM

˜F e−2iψ/hb ∧ ⋆s2

h =ZM

ψ ( ˜Q2r2

˜F e−2iψ/hb ∧ ⋆− ¯∂∗−1

¯∂−1
ψ ( ˜F e−2iψ/hb) ∧ ⋆ ˜Q2r2

h

and use Lemma 2.7 and Proposition 3.2. Similarly one shows (5.6).

Next we will prove an L2-estimate where we take care of those exceptional

points that are not included in Lemma 5.4.

Lemma 5.5. There is an ε > 0 such that

k|F1| − |F2|kL2(M) ≤

C

| log H|2ε/15 , where H =

1

| log d(C1,C2)|γ ,

C = C(K, M, p, γ, ε) and 0 < γ ≤ 1/2.
Proof. By Lemma 5.4

| ˜F (p)| = ||F1(p)|2 − |F2(p)|2| ≤

C

δ7| log H|ε ,

p ∈ M \ N√δ.

(5.14)

It follows from this and the priori assumptions (1.4) that there is a C =
C(K, M, p, γ, ε) such that

k|F1|2 − |F2|2k2

||F1|2 − |F2|2|2 dVg

L2(M) =ZM\N√δ
≤ Vg(M )(cid:18)

||F1|2 − |F2|2|2 dVg +ZN√δ
δ7| log H|α(cid:19)2

C

+ Cδ2 ≤ C(δ−14| log H|−2ε + δ).

Choosing δ = | log H|−2ε/15, we get

k|F1|2 − |F2|2kL2(M) ≤ C| log H|−2ε/15.

(5.15)

Using that

|F1| − |F2| = |F1|2 − |F2|2
|F1| + |F2|

together with the fact that |F1| + |F2| is uniformly bounded from below we can
then also to conclude that

k|F1| − |F2|kL2(M) ≤ C| log H|−2ε/15.

(5.16)

In the last steps of the proof we indicate how to also get higher Sobolev

regularity estimates.

25

Proof of Theorem 1.1/1.2. Since we assume that Xj ∈ T ∗M, j = 1, 2 are real-
valued, we can decompose Xj = Aj + Aj, and then

dXj = dAj + dAj = dπ0,1Aj + dπ1,0Aj = ∂Aj + ¯∂Aj.

Let now αj be the primitive functions we introduced earlier, that is in the sense
that ¯∂αj = Aj and Fj = eiαj . Then

∂Fj = i∂αjFj ,
∂Fj = −iAjFj ,

¯∂Fj = iAjFj,
¯∂Fj = −i ¯∂αjFj.

Observe that −∂ ¯∂ = ¯∂∂ on functions so ∂ ¯∂αj = ∂Aj and −∂ ¯∂αj = ¯∂∂αj = ¯∂Aj.
Consider now

¯∂[|Fj|2] = i|Fj|2(Aj − ¯∂αj),

∂ ¯∂[|Fj|2] = i|Fj|2dXj − 4 ∂|Fj| ∧ ⋆ ¯∂|Fj|.

This implies that

∂ ¯∂(|F1|2 − |F2|2) = i|F1|2 d(X1 − X2) + i(|F1|2 − |F2|2) dX2

The above is equivalent with

− 4(cid:0)∂(|F1| − |F2|) ∧ ⋆ ¯∂|F2| + ∂|F1| ∧ ⋆ ¯∂(|F1| − |F2|)(cid:1) .

i|F1|2d(X1 − X2) = ∂ ¯∂(|F1|2 − |F2|2) − i(|F1|2 − |F2|2) dX2

or rewritten,

+ 4(cid:0)∂(|F1| − |F2|) ∧ ⋆ ¯∂|F2| + ∂|F1| ∧ ⋆ ¯∂(|F1| − |F2|)(cid:1) ,

d(X1 − X2) = −i|F1|−2∂ ¯∂(|F1|2 − |F2|2) − |F1|−2(|F1|2 − |F2|2) dX2
− 4i|F1|−2(cid:0)∂(|F1| − |F2|) ∧ ⋆ ¯∂|F2| + ∂|F1| ∧ ⋆ ¯∂(|F1| − |F2|)(cid:1) .

Next, under the assumptions that kFjkH 2+η (M) ≤ K for some η > 0, then by
Sobolev interpolation,

(5.17)

k|F1| − |F2|kHs(M) ≤ C| log H|−ε′ ,
k|F1|2 − |F2|2kHs(M) ≤ C| log H|−ε′ ,

(5.19)
for some 0 < ε′ < 2(1 − α)ε/15, α > 0 and 0 < s < 2 + η. Then from (5.17) we
can conclude that there is an s′ ≥ 0 so that

(5.18)

kd(X1 − X2)kHs′ (M) ≤ C| log H|−ε′ .

(5.20)

Similarly we want to give an estimate for the potentials qj, starting from

k ˜QkL2(M) = kQ2/(2|F2|2) − Q1/(2|F1|2)kL2(M) ≤ C| log H|−2ε/15,

(5.21)

where Qj := − ⋆ dXj + qj, j = 1, 2. Some simple algebra and using that the |Fj|
are bounded away from zero one can see that

kQ1 − Q2kL2(M) = kq1 − q2 − ⋆d(X1 − X2)kL2(M) ≤ C| log H|−2ε/15.

from which it simply follows, similarly as above, that

kq1 − q2kHs′ (M) ≤ C| log H|−ε′ .

(5.22)

For s′ = 0 we get Theorem 1.1, and η > 1 would allow for larger s′ > 0.

6 Stability for the holonomy

We ﬁnally focus our attention towards the holonomy of the 1-form X := X1 −
X2. We can for every closed loop γ based at any m ∈ M , consider parallel
transport for the connection ∇X = d + iX on the bundle M × C. This deﬁnes
an isomorphism P X
: C → C, so we may view P X
γ as a non-zero complex
γ
number and deﬁne the holonomy group of ∇X at m by

Hol(∇X , m) := {P X

γ ∈ C \ {0}; γ is a closed loop based at m}.

For real X, P X
γ
When the curvature dX = 0 there is a natural group morphism

is in fact unitary and it can be observed that P X

γ = ei Rγ X .

m : π1(M, m) → Hol(∇X , m),
ρX

where π1(M, m) is the ﬁrst fundamental group, consisting of equivalence classes
of closed curves up to homotopy. The morphism ρX is called the holonomy
representation into GL(C) and it is trivial if and only if P X
γ = 1 for all closed
loops based at m, independent of m. We will show Theorem 1.3, or more
precisely:

Zγ

inf

k∈Z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

X − 2πk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ |γ|ω(d(C1,C2)),

where ω = ω(x) = C(log | log x|)−ε → 0 as x → 0, C = C(K, M p, ε). Thus the
holonomy representation is in this sense close to being trivial.

Proof ot Theorem 1.3. Let us again consider the functions Fj and deﬁne the
new function

Θ := F1F −1

.

Then ¯∂Θ = i(A1 − A2)Θ and hence ∂Θ−1

= i(A1 − A2)Θ−1

. This implies that

¯∂Θ
Θ

+

∂Θ−1
Θ−1 = i(A1 − A2) + i(A1 − A2) = i(X1 − X2) = iX.

By (5.19) and Sobolev embedding, ||F1|2 − |F2|2| ≤ ω, so

Multiplying the above inequality with |F1−1

| we equivalently have

|F1F1 − F2F2| < ω.
F −1

2

|F1F −1

2 − F2F1−1

| = |Θ − Θ−1

| < ω,

since the F −1

j

are bounded away from zero. So we may write

Θ−1

= Θ + θ,

|θ| < ω.

Thus we have,

¯∂Θ
Θ

+

∂Θ−1
Θ−1 =

¯∂Θ
Θ

+

∂(Θ + θ)

Θ + θ

=

¯∂Θ
Θ

+

∂Θ
Θ

+

Θ∂θ − θ∂Θ
Θ(Θ + θ)

=

dΘ
Θ

+ ˜θ = iX,

27

where |˜θ| . ω by Sobolev embedding (Xj ∈ W 2,p, p > 2 implies that Fj ∈
W 3,p ⊂ C1,α for some α > 0).
Let now γ be any closed curve on M , it will be made up of a ﬁnite number
of non-self-intersecting loops. So without loss of generality we can assume that
γ is made up of a single simple loops. We will show that for any such loop,

dΘ
Θ ∈ 2πiZ,

Zγ
≤(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Zγ

(6.1)

≤ |γ|ω,

and hence it will follow that

inf

k∈Z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Zγ

X − 2πk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which is what we want to show.

iX −Zγ

=(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Zγ

˜θ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

To show (6.1), suppose we remove a small subarc γq,p between two points
q, p ∈ γ, so that we are left with another arc γp,q consisting of the remaining
points on γ between p and q. Suppose then that we take a simply connected
tubular neighborhood N (γp,q) around γp,q. In this neighborhood,

is well-deﬁned (since the 1-form dΘ
of calculus,

Θ is closed) and by the fundamental theorem

g(q) :=Z q

p

dΘ
Θ

,

dg(q) =

dΘ

(q).

Furthermore, g(p) = 0 so we can try to ﬁnd a unique solution to this initial
value problem. Take a parametrization of γ = γ(t) so that γ(0) = p, γ(1) = q.
Let f (t) := Θ(γ(t)), then f′(t) = hdΘ(γ(t)), γ′(t)i = f (t)hdg(γ(t)), γ′(t)i. Now
f (0) = Θ(p) and solving the initial value problem for f hence yields

f (t) = Θ(p)eg(γ(t)).

Then Θ(q) = Θ(p)eg(q). Taking the limit as q → p (strictly enlarging the
neighborhood N (γp,q)) we thus ﬁnd

1 = exp(cid:18)lim

q→pZ q

p

dΘ

Θ (cid:19) .

We can then conclude that (6.1) must indeed be true and the theorem follows.
