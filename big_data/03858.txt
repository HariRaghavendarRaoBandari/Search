Abstract

The quasi-free neutron knockout reaction on 6He is investigated to discuss the dineutron corre-

lation in the ground state. In the present work, the momentum distributions of the two emitted

neutrons are calculated with the α + n + n three-body model and the simple reaction model,

and the eﬀects of the knockout process via the 5He resonance and the target dependence in the

momentum distributions are discussed. From the calculation, it is found that a clear signature of

the dineutron correlation can be obtained by choosing the kinematical condition to exclude the

process via the 5He resonance, while the inclusion of the 5He resonance drastically changes the

momentum distributions. It is also shown to be important to use the proton target in the quanti-

tative discussion on the dineutron correlation by the knockout reaction. In addition to theoretical

arguments, a possible experimental setup to determine the dineutron correlation via the quasi-free

knockout reaction is considered.

INTRODUCTION

A two-neutron halo structure observed in 6He, 11Li, and so on is one of the most interesting

topics in neutron-rich nuclei [1, 2]. Two-neutron halo nuclei are the Borromean systems,

in which no binary subsystems have bound states, and have been extensively studied from

both theoretical and experimental sides to understand their exotic binding mechanisms.

Theoretically, two-neutron halo nuclei have been studied by using the core + n + n three-

body models [3–12]. From the three-body model calculations, the importance of correlations

between halo neutrons has been suggested in their bindings [3, 7]. It has been also shown that

such a two-neutron correlation in the ground state is characterized as a spatially-correlated

neutron pair, the so-called dineutron [3, 6, 8, 10].

In order to experimentally investigate the correlation between halo neutrons through the

excitation mechanism of two-neutron halo nuclei, Coulomb breakup reactions have been

employed [13–18]. The cross sections in the Coulomb breakup reactions are found to have

a low-lying peak just above the breakup thresholds. This peak has been expected to be

responsible to properties of weakly-bound halo neutrons. In addition, the cluster sum rule

of the E1 transition has been discussed to be useful to investigate the ground-state structure

of the dineutron [19]. The Coulomb breakup reaction is dominated by the E1 transition,

and the E1 transition strength is deduced from the Coulomb breakup cross section. The

cluster sum rule value of the E1 transition depends only on the geometrical conﬁguration

of halo neutrons in the ground state. Thus, the spatial correlation between halo neutrons

has been discussed from the E1 sum rule value. Actually, for the 11Li case, the opening

angle between two halo neutrons was derived as 48+14

−18 degrees from the observed Coulomb

breakup cross section [18]. The observed opening angle indicates the spatial correlations of

two halo neutrons.

In spite of the advantages, it is shown, from theoretical sides, that the Coulomb breakup

reactions have uncertainties in extracting the information on the ground-state structure

of two-neutron halo nuclei. Firstly, it is indicated that the low-lying peaks in the cross

sections are governed by strong ﬁnal-state interactions (FSIs) and the sequential decay via

the core + n resonance dominates the low-lying peak [11, 12]. This fact shows that the

geometrical conﬁguration in the ground state cannot be extracted from the observables

other than the cluster sum rule value. In addition, the cluster sum rule value itself has an

2

uncertainty coming from the excited components of the core nucleus in the ground state of

two-neutron halo nuclei: In the cluster sum rule, the core nucleus is assumed to be inert.

However, it is shown that in the 11Li case the sum rule value is reduced by about 15 % by

taking into account the 9Li core excitation [12]. To discuss the ground-state structure such

as the dineutron more quantitatively, other kinds of reactions are required.

The knockout reaction is another useful tool to investigate the ground-state structure of

nuclei. In fact, for two-neutron halo nuclei 11Li and 14Be, the one-neutron knockout reaction

was employed by bombarding them on the 9Be target, and contributions of S- and P-states

were discussed by using the angular distributions of the emitted neutrons [20]. In the results

of Ref. [20], the relative contributions of diﬀerent partial waves in 11Li were determined by

taking into account the interference between diﬀerent parity partial waves, which appears as

the asymmetry in the angular distribution. The interference between diﬀerent parity waves

is a key for the dineutron correlation, but the dineutron correlation was not discussed in

Ref. [20]. It is interesting to discuss the dineutron correlation from the asymmetry in the

angular distribution of the knocked-out neutron from the two-neutron halo nuclei.

The purpose of this work is to investigate a possibility to extract more quantitative and

more reliable information of the dineutron correlation in Borromean nuclei by means of

the proton-induced neutron knockout reaction. Throughout the paper, 6He is taken as an

example, but the method presented here is applicable to any Borromean nuclei. In the one-

neutron knockout reactions of two-neutron halo nuclei, the other halo neutron is immediately

emitted because of the Borromean nature. We calculate the momentum distributions of two

emitted neutrons, and discuss the spatial correlation between the neutrons. In particular,

we calculate the distribution of the opening angle between the momentum vectors of the

two emitted neutrons.

In discussing the spatial correlations, we consider the quasi-free condition to minimize

the FSIs in the knockout reaction. In the quasi-free condition, the knocked-out neutron with

high-momentum transfer is almost free from the FSIs, and hence, it carries out information

on the ground-state structure. Furthermore, it is essential to use a probe which enables

us to see the inner part of the two-neutron wave function to obtain a clear signature of

the dineutron correlation from the knockout reaction. In this work, we show that a proton

target is suitable for such a probe in contrast to heavy ions which makes the reaction much

peripheral.

3

It is also important to minimize the eﬀect of the knockout process via the 5He resonance

to discuss the dineutron correlation in 6He. If the knockout reaction is dominated by the

process via the 5He resonance, the opening angle distribution is governed by the 3/2− single-

particle orbit corresponding to the 5He resonance. Such a dominance of the single spin-parity

orbit suppresses the asymmetry in the distribution, because the asymmetry comes from

the interference between diﬀerent parity single-particle orbits.

In this work, we estimate

the eﬀect of the process via the 5He resonance on the distributions, and try to ﬁnd the

kinematical condition to exclude the contribution from the knockout process via the 5He

resonance.

In the last part, a possible experimental setup that suﬃces all the requirements placed

by the theoretical arguments is considered. A high-momentum transfer, high statistics, and

availability to pin down the state of the core are the keys.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy explain the α + n + n three-body

model for 6He and the calculation of the knockout reaction. Next, we show the calculated

momentum distributions and discuss the eﬀect of the knockout process via the 5He resonance

and target dependence in the momentum distribution. From the calculated distributions, we

show the possibility of direct measurement of dineutron in 6He. In addition to theoretical

arguments, a possible experimental setup to determine the dineutron correlation via the

quasi-free knockout reaction is considered. All the results and discussions are summarized

in Sec. IV.

II. MODEL

A. α + n + n three-body model for 6He

Before discussing the knockout reaction, we explain the α + n + n three-body model

for 6He brieﬂy. To solve the relative motion of the α + n + n system, we employ the

orthogonality condition model (OCM) [21].

In the α + n + n OCM, the wave function for 6He is described as

Φ6He = Φαχnn,

(1)

where the wave function of the α core is expressed as Φα. The α core is described by the

harmonic oscillator wave functions for the (0s1/2)4 conﬁguration, whose oscillator length bc

4

is taken as 1.4 fm to reproduce the observed charge radius of 4He.

The relative wave function of the α + n + n system is obtained by solving the following

Schr¨odinger equation;

ˆHχnn = Eχnn.

(2)

The Schr¨odinger equation in Eq. (2) is accurately solved with a few-body technique. Here,

we employ the variational method called the hybrid-V T model whose detailed explanation

is given in Ref. [7].

The total Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) is given by

ˆH =

3

Xi=1

ˆti − ˆTcm +

2

Xi=1

ˆVαn(ξi) + ˆVnn + ˆVPF + ˆVαnn,

(3)

where ˆti and ˆTcm are kinetic operators for the i-th particle and the center-of-mass motion

in the α + n + n system, respectively. For two-body interactions for α-n and n-n, we use

the eﬀective interactions which reproduce the scattering observables for each subsystems.
We use the KKNN potential [22] for ˆVαn, where ξi is the relative coordinate between the
α particle and the i-th neutron. For ˆVnn, we use the Minnesota force [23] whose exchange

parameter is taken as 0.95.

The Pauli principle between the α core and neutrons is taken into account by the so-called
pseudo potential ˆVPF. The pseudo potential is a projection operator to remove the Pauli

forbidden state φPF from the relative motion between the α and neutrons and is given by

ˆVPF = λ|φPFihφPF|.

(4)

The Pauli forbidden state is deﬁned as the 0s orbits occupied by the α core. The strength

λ is taken as 106 MeV in the present calculation.

In the α + n + n OCM, the ground state of 6He is slightly underbound by using only the

two-body interactions. To reproduce the ground-state properties, we introduce the eﬀective

αnn three-body interaction [11, 29], which is given by

ˆVαnn = V3e−µ(ξ2

1 +ξ2

2),

(5)

where V3 and µ are determined to reproduces the observed binding energy and matter radius

of the 6He ground state. We here take V3 and µ as −1.503 MeV and 0.07/b2

c fm−2. The

ground-state properties obtained with the three-body interaction is listed in TABLE. I.

(7)

in the post-form representation, where φ0 is a plane wave between the target and projectile.
The interaction in the ﬁnal state, ˆVf , is the sum of the interactions between proton and each
constituent particle in 6He. The wave functions of 6He in the initial ground state and the

ﬁnal scattering one is represented by Φgs and Ψ6He, respectively. The initial scattering wave

between the target and projectile is given by ψ. The relative coordinates and momenta in

Eqs. (6) and (7) are deﬁned as shown in Fig. 1.

In the present calculation, we use the simple reaction model, in which the knockout

process via the 5He resonance and the absorption eﬀect by the target nucleus are taken into

account. We approximately describe the initial scattering wave ψ as

ψ(P0, R) = D(R)eiP0 ·R,

(8)

where D(R) is the dumping factor coming from the absorption by the proton target and

is calculated with the eikonal approximation. Furthermore, we take into account only the

p-n interaction as a residual interaction for the neutron knockout by a proton target, and
hence, the other interactions in ˆVf are operated on the wave function in the ﬁnal state φ0.

Operating these interactions on the ﬁnal-state wave function, φ0 is transformed as

φ0(P, R) → ψ′(P, R) = D′(R)eiP·R,

(9)

7

where D′(R) is calculated in similar to that in the initial state.

When we employ the zero-range interaction for the p-n one, we obtain the T -matrix in

Eq. (7) as

TP0(k, K, P) = V0DΨ6He(k, K, r, ρ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜D(ρ)eiq·ρ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Φgs(r, ρ)E,

where V0 is the strength of the p-n interaction and q is related to the transferred momentum
as q = 5(P0 − P)/6. The dumping factor ˜D(ρ) in Eq. (10) is given by

(10)

˜D(ρ) = D(cid:18)5

6

ρ(cid:19) · D′(cid:18)5

6

ρ(cid:19) .

(11)

Considering the quasi-free condition, we describe the scattering wave function of 6He,

Ψ6He, as

Ψ6He(k, K, r, ρ) = ψα-n(k, r) ⊗ eiK·ρ.

(12)

The relative motion between the knocked-out neutron and the rest is described by a plane

wave since the knocked-out neutron is free from the FSIs in the quasi-free condition. The

5He residue is expressed by the exact scattering wave function of α + n, ψα-n, to take into

account the process via the 5He resonance in the knockout reaction. The wave function ψα-n

is solved with the same α-n interaction as used in Eq. (3). By combining Eqs. (10) and (12),

we obtain

From Eq. (13), we also deﬁne the following T -matrix;

˜D(ρ)eiq·ρ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

TP0(k, K, P) = V0Dψα-n(k, r) ⊗ eiK·ρ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

III. RESULTS

A. Dineutron correlation in the ground state

Before discussing the momentum distribution in the knockout reaction, we ﬁrst show the

momentum distribution of the ground state of 6He to see the dineutron correlation in the

momentum space. The ground-state momentum distribution is calculated by taking the
dumping factor ˜D(ρ) as unity and switching oﬀ the α-n interaction in the ﬁnal states. We

thus replace the scattering wave function of α + n, ψα-n(k, r), with the plane wave eik·r in

Eq. (14).

The calculated momentum distribution is shown in Fig. 2. From the deﬁnition of the

momentum distribution in Eq. (16), the distribution shown in Fig. 2 is nothing but the

Fourier-transformed ground-state wave function of 6He. One sees that the momentum dis-

tribution in Fig. 2 has a two-peaked structure and the strength at around (kα-n, θ) = (0.4

fm−1, 135 degrees) is enhanced compared to the other peak. This enhancement is clearly

understood to come from the dineutron correlation in the ground state of 6He.

This dineutron correlation in the momentum space is also seen in the opening angle

distribution. We calculate the dW/dθ given by Eq. (18) with switching oﬀ the α-n interaction

in the ﬁnal state and taking the dumping factor as unity. The result is shown in Fig. 3. The

distribution in Fig. 3 has a two-peaked structure as expected from the result in Fig. 2. The

peak at θ > 90 degrees, corresponding to the dineutron correlation is slightly higher than

that to the cigar-like one at θ < 90 degrees.

The dineutron correlation seen in the opening angle distribution of Fig. 3 is found more

clearly in the momentum distributions with the ﬁxed relative momentum for α + n, kα-n. In

Fig. 4, we show the momentum distribution with the ﬁxed values of kα-n. Here, we choose

two momenta: kα-n = 0.2 and 1.0 fm−1. At kα-n = 0.2 fm−1, one sees that the signiﬁcant en-

hancement at larger angles corresponding to the dineutron correlation, while the distribution

at kα-n = 1.0 fm−1 shows the enhancement at smaller opening angle corresponding to the

cigar-like conﬁguration. This result shows that the dineutron correlation in the ground state

is developed in the surface region of 6He, which corresponds to small momentum between

the α core and neutron.

In our calculation, the asymmetry in the distributions in Fig. 4 dominantly comes from

the interference between the (0p3/2)2 and (1s1/2)2 components. In the ground state of 6He,

the relative phase between (0p3/2)2 and (1s1/2)2 is changed as kα-n ∼ 0.5 fm−1 due to the fact

that the single-particle wave function of 1s1/2 has a node at kα-n ∼ 0.5 fm−1. This change in

the relative phase makes the interference patterns at kα-n = 0.2 and 1.0 fm−1 diﬀerent from

each other.

B. Eﬀect of knockout process via the 5He resonance

To investigate the eﬀect of the process via the 5He resonance on the momentum distri-

bution in the knockout reaction, we switch on the α-n interaction in the ﬁnal states, and

calculate the momentum distribution. Here, we focus our discussion on the eﬀect of the

process via the 5He resonance, and the absorption in the knockout reaction is neglected by
taking the dumping factor in Eq. (10) as ˜D(ρ) = 1.

The calculated momentum distribution is shown in Fig. 5. We see that the inclusion of

the 5He resonance changes the distribution drastically, compared to the result in Fig. 3. The

distribution is concentrated on the kα-n ∼ 0.2 fm−1 region and has symmetric two-peaked

structure with respect to θ = 90 degrees. This shape of the distribution shows that the

knockout reaction of 6He is dominated by the process via the 5He(3/2−) resonance. The

resonance energy of 5He(3/2−) is coincident with kα-n ∼ 0.2 fm−1 and the symmetric two-

peaked structure comes from the (p3/2)2 conﬁguration of the two emitted neutrons, which is

favored by the process via the 5He resonance.

Furthermore, in the opening angle distribution shown in Fig. 6, we cannot ﬁnd any

signature of the enhancement of the dineutron correlation. By including the process via the

5He resonance, the distribution is changed to have the largest peak at θ < 90 degrees and the

contribution from the dineutron correlation becomes smaller than that from the cigar-like

one.

From the results in Figs. 5 and 6, it is shown that the inclusion of the 5He resonance

drastically changes the distributions and disturbs to ﬁnd the signature of the dineutron

correlation from the knockout reaction of 6He. To clarify the signature of the dineutron

correlation in the knockout reaction of 6He, it is important to minimize the eﬀect of the

process via the 5He resonance on the momentum distribution.

For this purpose, we calculate the distributions by ﬁxing the relative momentum between

the α + n. Here, we choose the oﬀ-resonant relative momentum for the α + n subsystem.

with ﬁxed kα-n. The red (solid) and blue (dotted) lines represent the distributions for kα-n = 0.1

and 0.4 fm−1, respectively.

The angular distributions calculated with kα-n = 0.1 and 0.4 fm−1, which are respectively

smaller and larger than the α-n relative momentum corresponding to 5He(3/2−) resonance,

are shown in Fig. 7. The patterns of the distributions are similar to those in Fig. 4. For

the smaller momentum, kα-n = 0.1 fm−1, the distribution shows a clear signature of the

dineutron correlation at θ > 90 degrees, while the distribution for the larger momentum,

kα-n = 0.4 fm−1, shows the cigar-like peak.

The results in Fig. 7 show that the information on the spatial correlation in the 6He

ground state survives in the quasi-free neutron-knockout reaction by choosing the kinemat-

ical condition to exclude the knockout process via the 5He resonance. The asymmetric

pattern in the momentum distribution is clearly conﬁrmed by ﬁxing kα-n even if the knock-

out process via the 5He resonance dominates the neutron-knockout reaction of 6He. On the

other hand, the opening angle distribution calculated by integrating over kα-n is not helpful

to investigate the spatial correlation such as dineutron.

C. Eﬀect of the absorption by the target nucleus on the momentum distributions

We estimate the eﬀect of the absorption by the target nucleus on the momentum distri-

butions. First, we show the dumping factor used in the present calculation. In Fig. 8, the

dumping factor for the proton target, given in Eq. (11), is shown in comparison with that

for the 12C target for reference. From the results in Fig. 8, we see that the proton target is

Using the dumping factors shown in Fig. 8, we calculate the momentum distributions with

ﬁxed values of kα-n. Here, to see the target-dependence of the momentum distributions, we

calculate the distributions not only for the proton target but also for the 12C one. In Figs. 9

and 10, we show the calculated distributions for kα-n = 0.1 and 0.4 fm−1, respectively, in

comparison with the distributions without the dumping factor. The absorptions by the

target nuclei reduce the strengths of momentum distributions both at kα-n = 0.1 and 0.4

fm−1. It is also seen that the absorptions are stronger at higher kα-n, which corresponds to

the interior region of the two-neutron wave function, and the reduction of the strength at

higher kα-n is much serious for the 12C case. For kα-n = 0.4 fm−1, the strength at the peak

position for 12C is 7.37 times smaller than the case without absorption, while that for the

proton is 1.72 times smaller than that. These trends are naturally understood by the shapes

of the dumping factors shown in Fig. 8.

Furthermore, as seen in Figs. 9 and 10, the asymmetry in the momentum distributions

is suppressed as the absorption becomes stronger. This fact indicates that the use of the

proton target is essential to investigate the spatial correlation of halo neutrons in the quasi-

free knockout reactions. To determine the asymmetry in the momentum distributions of the

two emitted neutrons quantitatively, the transparent target such as a proton provides us with

D. Experimental approaches to the two-neutron correlation

We have clariﬁed advantages of the proton-induced neutron knockout reaction in inves-

tigation of two-neutron correlations in Borromean nuclei. The experimental extraction of

15

signatures of the two-neutron correlation discussed above demands (i) selection of the (p, pn)

events with a suﬃciently large momentum transfer, (ii) high statistics to divide the opening

angle distribution according to kα-n, and (iii) a kinematically complete measurement to tag

contribution from the excited core states. In the following, an inverse kinematics experi-

ment with a hydrogen target is considered. A recoil proton and a knocked-out neutron are

detected dedicated detectors placed sideways. A decay neutron and a residual ion after the

(p, pn) reaction are analyzed with a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer, such as the

SAMURAI [30] at RIBF and the ALADIN at GSI, equipped with high-eﬃciency neutron

detector arrays.

In order to suppress possible eﬀects of three-body FSIs, momenta of the recoil proton

and the knocked-out neutron should be suﬃciently larger than nucleon Fermi momentum

in a nucleus which is about 1.3 fm−1. This condition can be fulﬁlled by using beams with

incident energies higher than 200 MeV/nucleon and by restricting the recoil proton energy

to be higher than 80 MeV. Radioactive nuclear beams at more than 200 MeV/nucleon are

available at the RI Beam Factory in Japan and the GSI in Germany at present and at the

FRIB in USA in near future.

Selection of the high-momentum transfer condition necessarily accompanies a small cross

section. The proton-neutron elastic scattering cross section in the energy and momentum

transfer regions considered is about 0.5 mb/sr while it is considerably large at forward angles.

In order to obtain suﬃcient statistics in an momentum distribution at each kα-n for the

small cross section, the experiment demands unprecedentedly high luminosity, typically, of

1029 cm−2sec−1. This can be realized with high-intensity radioactive nuclear beams with an

intensity of 105−6 sec−1 and a thick liquid hydrogen target with a thickness of 1023−24 cm−2.

An example of the latter is the MINOS[31]: The MINOS is a device consisting of a very

thick liquid hydrogen target and a time projection chamber surrounding the target. The

target thickness can be changeable and as much as 1024 cm−2. Determination of the vertex

position with the time projection chamber allows one to correct the energy loss of the beam

and the residual ions in the target and thus to enable high luminosity experiments without

a signiﬁcant loss of experimental resolutions.

The high luminosity enables tagging of the excited core contribution in the Borromean

nuclei. Eﬀects of unbound core states, which are considered to be signiﬁcant in 11Li, can be

explored with an invariant mass spectroscopy of the excited core states. On the other hand,

16

those of bound excited core states, being more important in heavier Borromean nuclei, can

be tagged through γ-ray detection with a high-eﬃciency scintillator array. New data on

the eﬀects of excited cores should reveal unexplored aspects of Borromean nuclei and bring

about a better understanding of the two-neutron correlation in the nuclei.

IV. SUMMARY

We here investigated the dineutron correlation in 6He by using the quasi-free neutron

knockout reaction. In the present analysis, we calculated the momentum distributions of

two emitted neutrons, and compared them with those in the ground state to discuss the

spatial correlation between halo neutrons. The calculated momentum distributions show

the diﬀerent patterns from the ground-state distributions due to the knockout process via

the 5He(3/2−) resonance. To minimize the eﬀect of the process via the 5He resonance on the

momentum distributions, we have also shown the momentum distributions by choosing the

oﬀ-resonance region for the α-n relative momentum. By selecting α-n relative momentum

to exclude the process via the 5He resonance, the distributions show similar patterns to

the ground-state ones. For the lower α-n relative momentum, the calculated distribution

shows a clear enhancement at larger opening angle between the momenta of the two emitted

neutrons. This result suggests the spatially-correlated neutron pair at surface region of the

halo nucleus 6He. In addition, we discussed the eﬀect of the absorption by the target nucleus

on the momentum distributions. From the calculation, it is shown that the absorption by the

target reduces not only the magnitude of the momentum distribution but also asymmetry

in the distribution. Our results indicate that the use of the proton target, which is the most

transparent probe sensitive to neutrons, is essential to investigate the spatial correlation of

halo neutrons. Furthermore, we also discuss a possible experimental setup to suﬃce all the

requirements placed by the theoretical arguments.
