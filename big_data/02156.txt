Junction systems of odd-frequency (OF) superconductors are investigated based on a mean-ﬁeld
Hamiltonian formalism. One-dimensional two-channel Kondo lattice (TCKL) is taken as a concrete
example of OF superconductors. Properties of normal and Andreev reﬂections are examined in a
normal metal/superconductor junction. Unlike conventional superconductors, normal reﬂection is
always present due to the normal self energy that necessarily appears in the present OF pairing
state. The conductance reﬂects the diﬀerence between repulsive and attractive potentials located
at the interface, which is in contrast with the preexisting superconducting junctions. Josephson
junction is also constructed by connecting TCKL with the other types of superconductors. The
results can be understood from symmetry of the induced Cooper pairs at the edge in the presence
of spin/orbital symmetry breaking. It has also been demonstrated that the symmetry argument for
Cooper pairs is useful in explaining Meissner response in bulk.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Odd-frequency (OF) superconductivity [1–5], which is
characterized by pair potential or pair amplitude with
odd functions in time and frequency, has been recognized
as a candidate of intriguing quantum states of matter.
While its realization has been theoretically proposed in a
variety of systems [6–10] there has been a long-standing
problem: a thermodynamic instability arises if we apply
a conventional approach to OF superconductivity which
has succeeded in describing ordinary even-frequency (EF)
superconductors [11, 12]. At the same time, the sign of
electromagnetic response function is reversed from the
usual diamagnetic one, indicating a paramagnetic Meiss-
ner response and negative superﬂuid density. Therefore,
its realization in bulk of condensed matter has been ques-
tioned. On the other hand, without such diﬃculties the
OF superconductivity can exist as a surface state. While
the ordinary EF superconductivity is dominant in bulk,
the OF pairing state is present as an induced state [13–
16]. It has been reported that the paramagnetic Meissner
response [17–20] is observed in this induced OF pairing
state [21].

Recent theoretical studies show that the OF pairing
can also be stabilized in a bulk, if we reconsider some
conditions which are usually assumed in the theory of
conventional superconductors. Namely, the sign arising
from the OF pair potential ∆(−ω) = −∆(ω), which
causes the thermodynamic instability, can be canceled
by introducing an additional sign. One of the solutions
is to re-examine the conjugate relations of the frequency-
dependent pair potential [22–24]. Using a path-integral
formalism, it has been shown in Refs. 23 and 24 that
the problem can be resolved by using an unusual con-
jugate relation for pair potential, and consequently a
description based on Hermitian mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian
is impossible. Subdominant even-frequency pairings in-
duced in inhomogeneous systems such as surface or de-
fect have been classiﬁed for this kind of OF pairing based

on symmetry arguments [25]. With this situation, how-
ever, recently Josephson junctions have also been studied
by Fominov et al. and peculiar properties are revealed
[26]. Whereas a real current is obtained for the junction
with EF superconductor, the current becomes imaginary
if we make a junction with paramagnetic OF supercon-
ductivity realized at e.g. the edges of p- or d-wave super-
conductors. Furthermore, an electromagnetic response
function shows that the superﬂuid weight becomes com-
plex number when these diamagnetic and paramagnetic
odd-frequency pairings coexist [26]. These unphysical be-
haviors at least indicate that the conventional approach
fails in describing the coexistence of the above OF super-
conductor.

On the other hand, it has also been established that
there is another type of stable OF superconductivity,
which can be described in the mean-ﬁeld theory with
Hermitian Hamiltonian. Here, the additional minus sign
to resolve the thermodynamic problem comes from a spa-
tially oscillating phase of the pair amplitude [11], which
is called staggered pairing [27, 28]. The existence of stag-
gered OF pairing has been clearly demonstrated in the
two-channel Kondo lattice (TCKL) [29, 30]. In this pa-
per, for a deeper understanding of this type of OF super-
conductors, we take TCKL as a concrete example and
explore novel properties of the junction systems to clar-
ify the diﬀerence from already known superconductors.

Superconducting states are classiﬁed by internal struc-
tures of the Cooper pairs [31–33]: even (E) or odd (O)
in time (frequency), triplet (T) or singlet (S) in spin
space, even (E) or odd (O) in real space (momentum),
and even (E) or odd (O) in orbital space. To be con-
sistent with Fermi-Dirac statistics, the exchange symme-
try of these indices must be odd in total. Hence, we
can have eight classes of symmetry of Cooper pair la-
beled by ESEE, ESOO, ETOE, ETEO, OTEE, OTOO,
OSOE, and OSEO. We additionally consider uniform and
staggered spatial modulation patterns for pairing states.
There is a similar state called pair density wave (PDW)

which also has a spatially oscillating pair amplitude [34–
41]. If the modulation appears in a staggered manner,
PDW is identiﬁed as the staggered pairing or η-pairing
[42–46]. These pairing states are characterized by a ﬁ-
nite center-of-mass momentum. Recently, the Amperean
pairing, where the electrons with same momentum are
paired, is theoretically proposed in the context of pseudo
gap phase in cuprate [47, 48]. This state also carries
a ﬁnite center-of-mass momentum. While these concepts
have been developed without relation to OF pairing, here
we demonstrate that these spatially modulated states are
closely connected to it.

With spatial modulations of pair amplitudes, OF and
EF components mix. Table I summarizes the pairing
states. Even when OF and EF pair amplitudes coexist,
we can clearly deﬁne the OF superconductivity in some
situations, since the pair potential can have only OF com-
ponent. Indeed this is the case realized in TCKL as will
be discussed in this paper. It will also be demonstrated
that the symmetry argument is quite useful to discuss
Meissner response of OF superconductors and Josephson
junctions.

In this paper we discuss the staggered OF supercon-
ductivity in TCKL based on a mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian.
The model and bulk properties are discussed in Secs. II
and III, which can be applied to systems in arbitary di-
mensions. Junctions in one dimension are made using OF
superconductors and normal metal to investigate charac-
teristics of Andreev reﬂection (Sec. IV) and Josephson
current (Sec.V). We summarize the obtained results in
Sec. VI.

We begin with the two-channel Kondo lattice [49, 50]

whose Hamiltonian is given by

HTCKL = Xijσm

iσmcjσm

(−tij − µδij )c†
2 Xiσmm′

τi · c†

+

iσmσmm′ ciσm′

(1)

where ciσm (c†
iσm) is an annihilation (creation) opera-
tor of electrons at site i with spin σ =↑,↓ and orbital
m = 1, 2. We deﬁne the 2 × 2 Pauli matrix σ and the
localized pseudospin operator τi at site i. This model
is known as an eﬀective model for f -electron systems
with non-Kramers conﬁguration, and can be applicable
to some Pr- and U-based compounds [50]. Since in f -
electron systems the spin and orbital are coupled and the
total angular momentum is a good quantum number, the
index σ physically describes a Kramers index, which is
connected by the time-reversal symmetry, and the orbital
m a non-Kramers index. For simplicity we call σ “spin”,
and m “orbital” in the following. The hopping integrals
are given by tij = t for the nearest neighbor sites and
otherwise zero. In Secs. II and III we consider a general
simple bipartite lattice such as a cubic lattice and do not
restrict ourselves to a one-dimensional chain.

In the previous study [29], TCKL has been investi-
gated by the dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory, and the exis-
tence of the OF superconductivity has been numerically
demonstrated. The corresponding eﬀective mean-ﬁeld
theory has also been successfully constructed [30], which
qualitatively describes the pairing state at low temper-
atures. In this framework, we ﬁrst rewrite the localized
pseudospin-operator τi by introducing pseudofermion as
2Pmm′ f †
τi = 1
imσmm′fim′ with the local operator con-
straint Pm f †
imfim = 1 at every site. In the mean-ﬁeld
theory, this constraint is satisﬁed only in the mean value:
Pmhf †
imfimi = 1. The interaction term is decoupled by
the mean-ﬁeld approximation. This procedure is depen-
dent on the spin:

where we have deﬁned the antisymmetric tensor ǫ = iσy
and the staggered ordering vector Q = (π, π,··· ) with
the lattice constant being unity. The vector Ri repre-
sents the position of site i. The mean-ﬁeld potential V
is determined by the self-consistent equation

V = −

4 hc†

i↑mfimi =

3J
4 hci↓mfim′iǫmm′eiQ·Ri

(4)

Here the middle part (diagonal quantity) and last part
(oﬀ-diagonal quantity) can be diﬀerent in general. How-
ever, the diﬀerence causes the channel symmetry break-
ing [30] and is energetically unfavorable away from half

ﬁlling [29]. Hence we take the same value as in Eq. (4),
which corresponds to the U(1) symmetry breaking with-
out any other spontaneous symmetry breaking. This
point can also be justiﬁed because the dynamical mean-
ﬁeld theory, which takes full account of local correlation
eﬀects, shows the qualitatively same results at low en-
ergies and low temperatures. For simplicity, in the fol-
lowing of this paper we neglect the self-consistency of
the equation, and we take the mean-ﬁeld V as an input
parameter.

At half ﬁlling, this pair is likely to be formed since both
the wave vectors k and −k − Q can be placed on the
Fermi surface. In fact, this pairing state can exist away
from half ﬁlling, even though the direct pair between k
and −k − Q cannot be formed on the Fermi surface of
conduction electrons. This is because the condensation
energy is gained not by the pair between conduction elec-
trons, but by the pair between conduction electron and
pseudofermion as shown in Eq. (5). The energy gain
is an increasing function of a size of Fermi surface, and
hence the transition temperature becomes maximum at
half ﬁlling [29].

From the expression of Eq. (4) one might think that the
present pairing is an even-frequency pairing, since there
is no time dependence in the pairing amplitude. How-
ever, the pseudofermions are nothing but virtual degrees
of freedom, and must be traced out to evaluate physical
quantities. This is because the fermionic operator fim
is introduced to describe the localized pseudospin and
such fermion does not exist in the original Hamiltonian.
Accordingly experimentally measurable physical quan-
tities should not directly include these pseudofermions.
The relevant order parameter is then given by a time-
dependent pairing amplitude composed only of conduc-
tion electrons as seen below.

The mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian is explicitly written down

as [30]

(5)

Here the phase of the pair amplitude is ﬁxed. We can also
consider self energies from Green functions [30]. After
tracing out the pseudofermion degrees of freedom, the
normal and anomalous self energies (pair potential) for
conduction electrons are given by

Σi(z) =

∆i(z) =

respectively, where z = ε + iη for real frequencies (η is
positive inﬁnitesimal) and z = iεn = (2n+1)πiT for Mat-
subara frequencies. This expression explicitly demon-

3

strates the realization of staggered OF superconductiv-
ity: the pair potential has only odd-frequency compo-
nent. As seen in Eq. (7) the staggered pairing is regarded
as both “Fulde-Ferrell (FF)” and “Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(LO)” states [51, 52]. While the spatial modulation is
slowly varying in FFLO pairing, the spatial oscillation in
TCKL is much faster than that in FFLO state.

We show that the staggered property of pair amplitude
can be removed by the local gauge transformation only
for σ =↓ deﬁned by ci↓m −→ ci↓meiQ·Ri. With this the
Hamiltonian is transformed as

(8)

Thus the staggered nature is completely washed away for
inﬁnite system. At the same time the sign of the hop-
ping of an electron with ↓-spin is reversed. While we
have emphasized that the staggered nature is important
for the thermodynamically stable OF superconductivity,
the present argument shows that it is not the only way.
Namely the eﬀect from the staggered phase can be re-
placed by the sign diﬀerence between hoppings of elec-
trons with the two spins. With this Hamiltonian, the
normal and anomalous self-energies are given respectively
by

Σi(z) = ∆i(z) =

(9)

Note that we now obtain the uniform OF state, with
spin-symmetry breaking.

III. COOPER PAIRS FORMED IN TCKL

Before we study junction systems,

let us discuss
the symmetry of Cooper pairs formed in bulk of
TCKL. The time-dependent pairing amplitude deﬁned
by Fkk′σσ′mm′(τ ) = −hTτ ckσm(τ )ck′ σ′m′i has the follow-
ing structure [30]:

Fkk′σσ′mm′(τ ) = ǫσσ′ ǫmm′δ−k−Q,k′Fk(τ ),

(10)

where Tτ is an imaginary-time ordering operator and
O(τ ) = eτ H Oe−τ H .
Eq. (10) means the stag-
gered spin-singlet orbital-singlet pair. From the Fermi-
Dirac statistics we have the relation Fkk′ σσ′mm′(τ ) =
−Fk′kσ′σm′m(−τ ), which leads to

F−k−Q(τ ) = −Fk(−τ ).

(11)
An explicit form of Fk(τ ) can be found in Ref. 30, but it
is not necessary in this paper.
With spatial modulations, EF and OF components
should be mixed due to a broken translational invariance.
To see this explicitly in TCKL, we deﬁne

F ±
kk′σσ′mm′(τ ) = Fkk′ σσ′mm′(τ ) ± Fkk′σσ′mm′(−τ ),

(12)

TABLE II:
Induced pairs in addition to the original
OSEO+ESOO pairs when symmetry breaking ﬁelds are
present in TCKL. The components in the diﬀerent brackets
are not identical in the presence of the symmetry breaking
ﬁelds.

where F + and F − correspond to the EF and OF pair
amplitudes, respectively. We can show that the exchange
of the two wave vectors results in

F ±
k′kσσ′mm′(τ ) = ∓F ±

kk′σσ′mm′(τ )

(13)

As seen from Eq. (13), the exchange symmetry of real
space is odd for EF pair and even for OF pair. For
both spin and orbital indices, the exchange symmetries
are odd. Thus the existing pairs in bulk of TCKL are
OSEO and ESOO (see also Tab. I). We note that the
primary component is OSEO which arises from purely
odd-frequency pair potential in Eq. (7), and ESOO is a
secondarily induced pair.

We comment also on induced pairs in addition to the
original pairs OSEO+ESOO when symmetry breaking
ﬁelds are present. If we apply the Zeeman ﬁeld, it mixes
up the spin-singlet and spin-triplet. The induced pairs
are then ETEO+OTOO. In a similar manner, when we
apply the external orbital ﬁeld, which corresponds to
a uniaxial pressure, the orbital-odd and even parts are
mixed, which causes ESEE and OSOE pairs. In addition
we can also consider another symmetry-breaking ﬁeld.
This is called spin-orbital ﬁeld, and breaks both spin and
orbital symmetries but their product remain unbroken.
In this case the induced pairs are OTEE+ETOE. These
properties are summarized in Tab. II, and are important
to understanding the Josephson junction as will be dis-
cussed in Sec. V.

For transformed Hamiltonian given in Eq. (8), the OF
pair has a uniform character. In terms of the classiﬁca-
tion in Tab. I, the transformed state belongs to uniform
OSEO. Since the spin symmetry is broken in this picture,
the uniform pair with ETEO is mixed at the same time.
Thus the secondarily induced pairs are transformed from
ESOO to ETEO by the local gauge transformation.

In the following we explain how the OF pairs in TCKL
give the ordinary diamagnetic Meissner eﬀect, although
the odd-frequency superconductors have long been con-
sidered to give a paramagnetic Meissner kernel. While
the numerical calculation [30] shows the diamagnetic re-
sponse, here we discuss it by focusing on the structure of
the Meissner kernel and do not enter the details. Follow-
ing the derivation in Ref. 30, only the anomalous part
contributes to the Meissner kernel K xx which can be

written in the form

K xx = −2e2T Xnkk′σσ′mm′

vx
kvx

k′

× F †

kk′ σσ′mm′ (−iεn)Fkk′ σσ′mm′(iεn),

(14)

where e is an electric charge, and we deﬁne the veloc-
ity vx
k = ∂εk/∂kx along the x-direction. We have also
introduced the ‘daggered’ anomalous Green function by
F †
kk′σσ′mm′(τ ) = −hTτ c†
k′ σ′m′i. From Hermitic-
ity of the Hamiltonian, we have the relation

kσm(τ )c†

F †
kk′ σσ′mm′ (−iεn) = F ∗

k′kσ′σm′m(iεn)

(15)

This relation can be explicitly shown by using the spec-
tral representation. We assume the inversion symmetry
in the original lattice: ε−k = εk.

Let us consider the conventional spin-singlet s-wave
(EF) superconductor as a reference. The anomalous
Green’s function has the structure in the form

kk′ σσ′ (iεn) = δ−k,k′ ǫσσ′F BCS
F BCS

k

(iεn).

(16)

Here we do not have to know the detailed functional form
of F BCS
. The orbital degree of freedom is not included
here. The Meissner kernel is then given by

k

K xx = −2e2T Xnkσ

vx
kvx

−k(ǫ2)σσ|F BCS

k

(iεn)|2

(17)

−k = −vx

For the velocity we have the relation vx
k, which
gives the minus sign.
In addition, another sign comes
from the spin factor (ǫ2)σσ = −1, and hence in total the
electromagnetic response is diamagnetic: K xx < 0. On
the other hand, if we had s-wave spin-triplet OF super-
conductivity, there would be no sign from spin-factor.
Hence in this case the sign of the Meissner kernel is re-
versed to give a paramagnetic response (or sometimes
called negative Meissner eﬀect). For p-wave supercon-
ductors, the minus sign comes from spatial part,
i.e.
−k = −F BCS
F BCS
Now we consider the kernel in TCKL. Substituting
Eq. (10) into Eq. (14), we obtain

, instead of spin part.

kvx

−k−Q(ǫ2)σσ(ǫ2)mm

K xx = −2e2T Xnkσm
× F ∗

−k−Q(iεn)Fk(iεn)

(18)

Although the factors from spin and orbital parts give the
minus sign as (ǫ2)σσ = (ǫ2)mm = −1, the sign oper-
ates twice and does not aﬀect the total Meissner kernel.
For the velocity, we have vx
k originating from
εk+Q + εk = 0, which gives no minus sign in contrast to
the above s-wave spin-singlet superconductor. We fur-
ther transform the expression in terms of EF and OF
pair amplitudes F ±
k (iεn) originating from Eqs. (10) and
(12). Using the relation in Eq. (11), the ﬁnal expression
is written as

−k−Q = vx

K xx = 2e2T Xnk

(vx

k)2(cid:2)|F +

k (iεn)|2 − |F −

k (iεn)|2(cid:3) .

(19)

Namely the OF pair (OSEO) gives a diamagnetic contri-
bution and the EF pair (ESOO) shows a paramagnetic
response, which is contrary to the standard wisdom. Al-
though it is not trivial to determine which parts give the
dominant contribution, the numerical calculation shows
that the OF part is more dominant to give the total dia-
magnetic response [30]. This fact implies the importance
of the OF pair in TCKL.

The characteristic diamagnetic response by OF pairs
in TCKL is closely related to vx
k with ﬁnite
center-of-mass momentum Q. Otherwise we would have
another minus sign from vx
k and then the OF
pair gives paramagnetic contribution. This point has also
been numerically demonstrated in Ref. 30.

−k = −vx

−k−Q = vx

At the end of this section,

let us also consider the
Meissner kernel in the modiﬁed TCKL given by Eq. (8).
In this case the uniform pair amplitudes have the form

instead of Eq. (14). The important point here is that the
velocity is dependent on spin: vk↑ = vk and vk↓ = −vk.
Substituting Eq. (20) into the kernel (21), we obtain the
essentially same result as Eq. (19) which shows diamag-
netic response. While we have no staggered phase here,
the additional minus sign comes from the spin-dependent
velocity. Thus we have explicitly demonstrated that the
staggered nature is not the only way to stabilize OF su-
perconductivity.

IV. N/S JUNCTION

In this section we consider a tunneling conductance in
normal metal (N)/superconductor (S) junction, where S
is a superconducting TCKL in one dimension. Tunnel-
ing conductance can be calculated based on the Blonder-
Thinkham-Klapwijk theory [53], and a similar method
is developed also in the tight-binding system [54, 55].
We choose the bulk wave functions of TCKL satisfying
a proper boundary condition and calculate both the An-
dreev and normal reﬂections in this N/S junction. For
simplicity we take the half-ﬁlled case (µ = 0) in the fol-
lowing, and qualitatively same results can be obtained
for µ 6= 0.
The mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian introduced in the previous
section can be decomposed into two sets of subsystems:
(ck1↑, c†
−k−Q,2↑, fk↓) with Q =

−k−Q,2↓, fk↑) and (ck1↓, c†

with εk = −2t cos k and |ukp|2 + |vkp|2 + |wkp|2 = 1.
The dispersion relation is illustrated in Fig. 1. When we
take another subsystems, the behaviors discussed in this
section remain unchanged. We note that the gapless part
αk0 contributes to the diamagnetic Meissner kernel [30].
This is possible because the Fermi surface is composed
of both electron and hole to form a Bogoliubov particle,
as is distinct from an ordinary metal.

Now we consider the N/S junction. The normal metal
with V = 0 and staggered OF pairing state with V 6= 0
in Eq. (5) are placed at the left- (i ≤ −1) and right-hand
(i ≥ 1) sides, respectively. When the (↑, 1) conduction
electron with the energy E > 0 is injected from the left,
the wave function in N is written in the vector form as

ψN(i) = 1

0! eiqi + a 0

1! e−iqi + b 1

0! e−iqi.

(25)

The results for E < 0 are obtained from the ones for
E > 0 by using the particle-hole symmetry. The coeﬃ-
cients a and b correspond to Andreev and normal reﬂec-
tion weights, respectively. The wave vector q is deter-
mined by the condition E = εq. Here we have only the
two components because the localized pseudofermions
are decoupled in N. A part of injected electron transmits

(a)

relations. This situation is similar to a usual quantum
mechanics which requires smooth wave functions at the
boundary. We consider the extrapolated wave functions
ψN(1) and ψS(0) which satisfy the relations [54]

EψN(−1) = ˆtψN(0) + ˆtψN(−2) + ˆHloc,V =0ψN(−1)
EψS(1) = ˆtψS(0) + ˆtψS(2) + ˆHloc,V ψS(1)

metal in (a). In (b) the Josephson current is calculated at the
two sites located at the center of the chain.

By solving these equations we can explicitly derive the
coeﬃcients a, b, c, d and the wave function ψ(0) at the
interface.

The normal reﬂectance A, Andreev reﬂectance B, and

transmittances C, D of quasiparticles are deﬁned by

group velocity appear. We note that ˜k becomes imagi-

nary for E < −t + √t2 + 2V 2 ≡ Ec, where it exists as a

Here we consider the barrier potential v at the edge of
the normal metal. The present setup of the system is
schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a).

We assume the sites for i ≤ −1 and for i ≥ 1 are de-
scribed by the wave functions ψN(i) and ψS(i), respec-
tively. At the sites i = −1, i = 0 and i = 1 we have the
relations

EψN(−1) = ˆγψ(0) + ˆtψN(−2) + ˆHloc,V =0ψN(−1)

(28)

Eψ(0) = ˆγψN(−1) + ˆγψS(1) + ˆvψ(0)
EψS(1) = ˆγψ(0) + ˆtψS(2) + ˆHloc,V ψS(1)

(29)

(30)

The diagonal matrices are made from Eqs. (5) and (27)
as ˆt = diag (−t, t), ˆγ = diag (−γ, γ) and ˆv = diag (v,−v).
These matrices are 2 × 2 matrices, and they operate for
the upper two components of ψS, since pseudofermions
have no inter-site hopping. We also deﬁne the matrix
ˆHloc,V which originates from the local part of Eq. (5).
The function ψ(0) cannot be described in general by ei-
ther ψN or ψS due to the presence of the potential v.
To determine the coeﬃcients we need to have another

where the factor 4 originates from spin and orbital de-
grees of freedom and h is the Planck constant. The con-
dition A > B means the existence of an excess current
due to Andreev reﬂection, or Cooper pair tunneling into
the S part. We note that in actual systems the energy is
given by E = eV0 with electric charge e and bias voltage
V0.

We ﬁrst discuss the N/S junction for the v = 0 case.
Figure 3 shows the reﬂectances and transmittances de-
ﬁned by Eqs. (33–36). We take the hybridization strength
Γ0 ≡ V 2/t = 10−4t, and the gap is then Ec ≃ Γ0. In the
high transmissivity limit with γ = t for E < Ec shown
in Fig. 3(a), a half of the injected electron transmits into
the TCKL superconducting state (C = 1/2). The other
half is reﬂected into the normal metal both as electron
(B = 1/4) and hole (A = 1/4). This behavior is in con-
trast to the ordinary s-wave superconductor, where the
perfect Andreev reﬂection (A = 1) can be observed. For
small γ case, the energy dependence is modiﬁed while the
behavior at low energy remains nearly unchanged.

The presence of normal reﬂection in TCKL is related to
the form of the mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian given by Eq. (5).

FIG. 4: (Color online) Conductances for the systems with (a)
repulsive (v > 0) and (b) attractive (v < 0) barrier potentials.
We take γ = t.

Namely, the gapped structure in spectrum has the char-
acters of both hybridization (normal) gap and supercon-
ducting (anomalous) gap. Consequently both the normal
and anomalous self energies are present as in Eqs. (6) and
(7), which cause normal and Andreev reﬂections simulta-
neously. Another characteristic behavior diﬀerent from
ordinary superconductors is that the transmittance into
the superconducting TCKL is ﬁnite even at zero energy.
This is due to the presence of the Fermi surface as shown
in Fig. 1. Hence bound states e.g. in S/N/S junction or
at vortex core are unlikely formed even in the clean limit
at low temperatures.

Now we consider the situation with ﬁnite barrier poten-
tial at the edge of the normal metal. The conductances
are shown in Fig. 4 for γ = t, where we normalize them by
the normal conductivity σN = 16(e2/h)t2γ 2/(t2 + γ 2)2.
It is characteristic that the peaked structure is observed
for v > 0 while there is no such behavior for v < 0. The
eﬀect of the sign of the barrier potential is remarkable
near the gap edge (E = Γ0), but it is irrelevant in the
low-energy limit.

ple form.

The solutions at low energies can be obtained in a sim-
In the limit with E ≪ Γ0 ≪ t, we can use
the relations q = k ≃ π/2 + E/2t, ei˜k ≃ tE/2V 2 and
u˜k+ ≃ E/2V . We then explicitly derive the reﬂectances

The magnitude of the reﬂectance of Andreev reﬂection
is enhanced with increasing energy E for v > 0 and is
diminished for v < 0, while the normal reﬂection shows
the inverse behavior. Thus the results are sensitive to the
setup at the boundaries. By contrast, the conventional
spin-singlet s-wave superconductor does not show such a
sign-sensitive behavior for barrier potential, and there is
no diﬀerence between repulsive and attractive potentials.
On the other hand, for suﬃciently large magnitude of
potentials both with v > 0 and v < 0, the line shape
of the resulting conductance becomes similar to that of
the local density of states (LDOS) at the edge as will be
shown in Fig. 5(a). This nonzero value of σ/σN at zero
energy clearly characterizes the present superconducting
state as distinct from ordinary superconductors.

The present conductance in TCKL is also diﬀerent
from that in spin-singlet d-wave or spin-triplet p-wave
superconductor junctions [56].
In these junctions, sur-
face Andreev bound state (SABS) produces a zero bias
conductance peak [57, 58] and the magnitude of odd-
frequency pairing amplitude is signiﬁcant at the surface
[59, 60]. On the other hand, in the present tunneling
spectroscopy of TCKL, the presence of the odd-frequency
pairing does not produce a clear zero bias conductance
peak.

V. JOSEPHSON JUNCTION

The staggered OF pairing state of TCKL is coupled
to the other types of superconductors in Josephson junc-
tions. We consider the simple spin-singlet s-wave super-
conductivity (ESEE), whose Hamiltonian is given by

Hs-wave = Hc + ∆Xiσσ′

ǫσσ′ c†

iσc†

iσ′ + H.c.

(42)

in one dimension. The conduction electron part is written
as Hc. As we mentioned in the introduction, there is
a paramagnetic OF superconductivity which is induced
only at the edge from EF superconductivity in bulk. Here
as one of such examples we take the spin-triplet px-wave
superconductor (ETOE). The Hamiltonian is explicitly
written as

Hpx -wave = Hc + ∆Xiσσ′

σσ′ c†
σx

iσc†

i+1,σ′ + H.c.

(43)

When we make an edge with this Hamiltonian, the local
(s-wave) electron pair is generated at the edge. Since
the spin structure of this pair is a triplet or even with
respect to the spin exchange, the time dependence of the

pair must be odd (OTEE). This induced OF pair at the
surface which is closely connected to the Andreev bound
state [60].

The Josephson junction can be constructed by con-
necting TCKL with one of the above superconductors.
The Hamiltonian of this system is given by H = HL +
HR + HI each of which describes the semi-inﬁnite left-
hand system (i ≤ −1), semi-inﬁnite right-hand system
(i ≥ 2) and the middle junction part, respectively. We
take the spin-singlet s- or spin-triplet px-wave supercon-
ductors as HL and the TCKL as HR. The Hamiltonian
for the junction part is given by

The present setup of the system in one dimension is

rent I is calculated at the center of this junction:

I = ieγIXσ

i=1,σci=0,σi

(45)

Here the Josephson current is well deﬁned because the
gauge-symmetry breaking terms are not included at the
junction region, and the equation of continuity locally
holds only by quasiparticle ﬂow.

The Josephson current can be calculated by using the
semi-inﬁnite Green function [61–63]. As an alternative
method one can approximate this by the Green function
at the edge of the ﬁnite chain. We take the number of
sites as N = 105 in the following. The semi-inﬁnite left-
and right-hand surface Green functions ˆgL
∞(z)
are explicitly derived from the Hamiltonians (42) and
(43), which can be written in a Nambu matrix form with
respect to spin/orbital index. The local Green functions
at the site i = 0 and 1 without the connection by γI are
given by

respectively. The indices 0 and 1 mean the site index at

from Eq. (44) in a manner similar to N/S junction. Using
these quantities, the Green functions at the junction are
given by

(a,b) and ∆ = 0.01t for (c,d). The inﬁnitesimal imaginary
part η is taken as η = 10−4t.

respectively, for TCKL. The values are normalized by
ρ0 = 1/2πt which is the density of states for a normal
metal. In contrast to the conventional spin-singlet s-wave
superconductor, the LDOS is nonzero at the Fermi level.
This is because the half of the Bogoliubov particles in
the OF pairing state have an energy gap and the oth-
ers still have the Fermi surface as shown in Fig. 1. The
frequency dependence of the real part of pair amplitude
(or anomalous Green function) shown in Fig. 5(b) is odd
with respect to real frequency. These behaviors are sim-
ilar to the ones in bulk [30]. Although here we cannot
see EF components, it appears as the inter-site Green
functions.

On the other hand, the LDOS at the edge of the spin-
triplet px-wave superconductor has the sharp peak as
shown in Fig. 5(c), which is known as a consequence of
the Andreev bound state [56–58]. This non-trivial local-
ized edge state is formed when the sign of the gap func-
tion felt by quasiparticle is reversed at the reﬂection pro-
cess. Figure 5(d) displays the local pair amplitude which
is odd in frequency (OTEE), although in bulk only the
spin-triplet px-wave EF pair (ETOE) is formed [14, 60].
Let us discuss how the edge state is connected to the
bulk state. Figure 6 shows the spatial dependence of the
LDOS at the Fermi level. Here the LDOS at the Fermi
level has the spatial dependence in the form

FIG. 6: (Color online) Spatial dependence of LDOS at the
Fermi energy. The edge is located at i = 0. The parameters
are same as the ones in Fig. 5.

where ρA and ρB are smooth functions in space. This os-
cillating behavior in a staggered manner originates from
half-ﬁlled situation with µ = 0, and the period of oscil-
lation changes for µ 6= 0 reﬂecting the change of Fermi
wave vectors. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the LDOS at the
edge of TCKL is continuously connected to the bulk. A
slow relaxation is characteristic for the metallic state, and
is consistent with the presence of Fermi surface in su-
perconducting state of TCKL. (In numerical simulation,
the healing length, which may be physically regarded as
mean free path, is given by ∼ t/η with small but ﬁnite
η.) Hence the character of this zero-energy state can be
regarded as similar to the one in bulk TCKL. For the
spin-triplet px-wave superconductor shown in Fig. 6(b),
on the other hand, the zero-energy state located at the
edge vanishes quickly as we go into the bulk state. This
edge state has a diﬀerent character from the bulk state
in this case.

With these preliminaries, now we consider the Joseph-
son junction. In the following we consider the zero barrier
potential case (v = 0) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The phase of the pair amplitude in the left-hand sys-
tem is taken as ϕL = ϕ, while it is set as zero in the
right-hand system as illustrated in Fig. 2. We begin with
the spin-singlet s-wave superconductor/TCKL junction.
However, the Josephson current completely vanishes in
the present simple setup. As explained later, the absence
of Josephson current is related to the fact that symme-
tries of the induced pairs located at the edges do not
match between the left- and right-hand sides.

In order to have ﬁnite current, the simplest modiﬁca-
tion without changing bulk properties, is to change the

ing ﬁnite currents is to modify the bulk nature of TCKL

with keeping the tunnel matrix γ′

(called the setup (ii) in the following) This term breaks
the orbital symmetry and experimentally corresponds to
the uniaxial pressure eﬀect. When we make the junc-
tion in real materials, some stress should be applied to
the edge of TCKL. Hence the eﬀect of Eq. (52) will rea-
sonably appear. For simplicity we take H = h in the
following, but this assumption does not aﬀect qualitative
aspect of the results.

Figure 7 shows the phase ϕ dependence of Josephson
currents, which is normalized by I0 = eγI(|∆|/γI)2. Let
us ﬁrst discuss the case with the setup (i). As shown
in Fig. 7(a), the Josephson current has the functional
form of I ∝ sin 2ϕ for spin-singlet s-wave superconduc-
tor/TCKL junction. This indicates that the ﬁrst-order

coupling vanishes in this case. The Josephson current for
the spin-triplet px-wave superconductor/TCKL junction
have the form I ∝ sin ϕ as seen in Fig. 7(b). On the other
hand, the results are changed for the setup (ii) as shown
in Fig. 7(c,d). The ﬁrst-order coupling survives for s-
wave superconductor/TCKL junction, while it vanishes
in the junction using px-wave superconductor.

These behaviors can be qualitatively understood by
considering the two-site model (zero-dimensional system)
that simulates the edges of right- and left- superconduc-
tors. Here we focus on the case with the setup (ii), and
the more detailed analysis including the setup (i) is given
in Appendix. The local spin-singlet s-wave pairing ﬁeld
term is given by Eq. (42), and the pairing ﬁeld for TCKL
by Eq. (5). We directly connect these two sites by the
matrix deﬁned by the third line of Eq. (44). The Joseph-
son current is explicitly evaluated as

I = 4e(γ′)2 sin ϕ T Xn

where Γm(z) = V 2/(z + σz
mmH) is the orbital-dependent
hybridization function. For h = H = 0 the anoma-
lous Green function of TCKL is a purely odd function
with respect to frequency, but the even-frequency com-
ponent mixes in the presence of orbital ﬁelds. From these
expressions it is clear that the Josephson current be-
comes zero if we take zero orbital ﬁeld (h = H = 0).
With ﬁnite orbital ﬁeld, on the other hand, F L and F R
have the same parity in frequency space, and the ﬁrst-
order contribution to the Josephson current becomes ﬁ-
nite. Namely, the induced EF pair in TCKL contributes
to the Josephson coupling. For spin-triplet px-wave su-
perconductor/TCKL junction, the Josephson coupling is
expressed by odd-frequency spin-triplet s-wave (OTEE)
and odd-frequency spin-singlet s-wave (OSEO) pairing.
Then, the ﬁrst-order contribution with respect to γ′ van-
ishes. Thus we obtain consistent results with numerical
calculations for a chain discussed above.

Next we discuss the above Josephson junction from
symmetry point of view. Originally, the OSEO+ESOO
pairs are present in TCKL without any ﬁeld as discussed
in Sec. III. On the other hand, for spin-singlet s-wave
superconductor the ESEE pair and the induced OSOE
pair are present at the edge.
In a similar manner the
ETOE and induced OTEE pairs exist for spin-triplet px-
wave superconductor. Thus, no symmetries match be-
tween TCKL and the other superconductors, and the
ﬁrst-order coupling in Josephson junction becomes zero.
In fact, this vanishing current persists to higher orders.

10

To explain this behavior, we must specify the component
of orbital-triplets in s- and px-wave superconductors. In
the present setup, since we do not include the orbital
degrees of freedom explicitly, the triplet component is
identiﬁed as Tz = 1 or −1 and no Tz = 0 component.
Thus the mismatch between orbital-singlet in TCKL and
orbital-triplet (Tz = ±1) in s- and px-wave superconduc-
tors gives exactly zero current in the present system.
With the tunnel matrix in the setup (i), the spin-
orbital symmetry breaking is present and the induced
pair is OTEE+ETOE according to Tab. II. Hence, the
ﬁrst-order Josephson coupling survives for px-wave su-
perconductor/TCKL junction, but it vanishes for s-wave
superconductor/TCKL case.
Similarly, with uniaxial
pressure in the setup (ii), the ESEE+OSOE pairs are
newly generated at the edge of TCKL, where orbital-
triplet component include Tz = 1. Hence the ﬁrst-
order contribution to Josephson current becomes nonzero
for TCKL/spin-singlet s-wave superconductor junction.
Since we rely only on the symmetry of Cooper pairs, the
above discussion should be applicable also to systems in
higher dimensions.

Finally we make a comment on the eﬀect of a barrier
potential v at the junction part (i = 0, 1). The phase ϕ
dependence of the currents with repulsive and attractive
potentials are shown in Fig. 7. The functional forms are
not inﬂuenced qualitatively by the sign of v, since the bar-
rier potential does not create any new species of Cooper
pairs. In addition, we do not observe the diﬀerence be-
tween v > 0 and v < 0. This behavior is consistent with
results in the N/S junction: the sign of the barrier po-
tentials does not aﬀect the behaviors in the low-energy
limit as shown in Fig. 4.

VI. SUMMARY

We have investigated the staggered OF pairing real-
ized in TCKL from a symmetry point of view. Although
the pair potential is purely odd function with respect
to time (frequency), both OF and EF components of
pair amplitude are present due to the absence of trans-
lational invariance even in the bulk. The existing pairs
in bulk are identiﬁed as primary OSEO and secondary
ESOO. We have also shown that a local gauge transfor-
mation changes the staggered state into uniform one with
spin-symmetry broken state. The mechanism for the dia-
magnetic Meissner eﬀect has been explained by focusing
on the symmetry of pair amplitude and structure of the
Meissner kernel. In addition to time/spin/space/orbital
structures of Cooper pairs, the ﬁnite center-of-mass mo-
mentum, which aﬀects the sign of the velocity, plays an
important role for diamagnetic response.

The N/S junction has been constructed and it is shown
that the normal reﬂection is always present in addition
to Andreev reﬂection. This behavior is in contrast with
ordinary BCS superconductors, where only the Andreev
reﬂection is observed for high transmissivity limit. The

diﬀerence lies in the presence of normal self energy in the
superconducting state of TCKL. Due to a ﬁnite density of
states, the transmittance into TCKL is also nonzero even
at low energies. Hence the bound state at e.g. supercon-
ducting vortex core is unlikely to be formed. When we
consider the barrier potential at the interface, the con-
ductance shows the diﬀerence between attractive and re-
pulsive potentials, although no such diﬀerence is observed
in conventional superconductors.

We have also investigated the Josephson junction us-
ing Green function formalism. We connect TCKL both
with spin-singlet s-wave and spin-triplet px-wave pairing
states. Here a uniaxial pressure eﬀect is considered for
TCKL, which is naturally expected at the edge of real
materials. For TCKL/spin-singlet s-wave superconduc-
tor junction, the relative phase ϕ dependence of Joseph-
son current becomes I ∝ sin ϕ. It becomes I ∝ sin 2ϕ for
TCKL/px-wave superconductor junction, where no ﬁrst-
order coupling appears. These Josephson currents can
be qualitatively described by a zero-dimensional system.
The symmetry of the pairs induced at the edge is a key
ingredient to understand the current phase relations of
Josephson junctions.

Here HL and HR simulate the edge of the s-wave super-
conductor and TCKL, respectively.

The tunnel matrix is given by Eq. (51), and the current

is simply deﬁned by

We can solve this model analytically, which helps us un-
derstand the basic properties of Josephson junction. We

The other contributions to current can also be calculated
in a similar manner. From the above equations, we can
obtain Eq. (53).

1 = γ′

For the special case with γ′

function matrixPm

2 = γ′ and H = h = 0,
namely without any symmetry breaking ﬁelds, the Green
ˆGm becomes diagonal. Correspond-
ingly, the anomalous parts in the second term of the
Eq. (A6), which is relevant to higher-order Josephson
couplings, are eﬀectively dropped from the equation and
the Josephson coupling terms vanish in general. This
behavior is consistent with the results discussed in Sec.
V.
