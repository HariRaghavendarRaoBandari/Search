Abstract

In this paper we develop a cost-beneﬁt analysis of a major research infrastructure, the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest-energy accelerator in the world, currently operating at
CERN. We show that the evaluation of beneﬁts can be made quantitative by estimating their
welfare eﬀects on diﬀerent types of agents. Four classes of direct beneﬁts are identiﬁed, according
to the main social groups involved: (a) scientists; (b) students and young researchers; (c) ﬁrms
in the procurement chain and other organizations; (d) the general public, including onsite and
website visitors and other media users. These beneﬁts are respectively related to the knowledge
output of scientists; human capital formation; technological spillovers; and direct cultural eﬀects
for the general public. Welfare eﬀects for taxpayers can also be estimated by the contingent
valuation of the willingness to pay for a pure public good for which there is no speciﬁc direct use
(i.e., as non-use value). Using a Monte Carlo approach, we estimate the conditional probability
distribution of costs and beneﬁts for the LHC from 1993 until its planned decommissioning in
2025, assuming a range of values for some critical stochastic variables. We conservatively esti-
mate that there is around a 90% probability that beneﬁts exceed costs, with an expected net
present value of about 2.9 billion euro, not considering the unpredictable applications of scientiﬁc
discovery.

Introduction

1
Cost-beneﬁt analysis (CBA) is widely used by governments and economists to evaluate the
socio-economic impact of investment projects;
it requires the forecasting of inputs, outputs,
and their marginal social values (MSVs) in order to determine the expected net present value
(N P V ) of a project. CBA theory is reviewed for example by Drèze and Stern 1987, 1990,
Johansson 1991, Boardman et al. 2006, Florio 2014, and Johansson and Kriström 2015. In this
framework, a project is desirable if its social beneﬁts exceed costs over time. This approach is
well developed for conventional infrastructure and is supported for example by the World Bank,
the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the OECD, and other national and
international institutions (Baum and Tolbert, 1985 and World Bank 2010; European Commission
2014, European Investment Bank 2013, and OECD 2015; for the WHO, see Hutton and Rehfuess,
2006).

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), our case study, is the biggest experimental machine in
the world (CERN 2009). This, arguably, is a stringent test of the practical applicability of the
Florio and Sirtori (2015) methodology, because of the very large scale of the project, its long
time horizon, its peculiar international management, and ﬁnally because the LHC’s physics is
basic science, at present without any predictable economic application.

The structure of the paper is the following: in the next section we brieﬂy present the object
of our analysis, the LHC, and why it poses a challenge for CBA; in section 3 we introduce our

Until now, the application of CBA to research infrastructure (RI) has been hindered, however,
by claims that the unpredictability of future economic beneﬁts of science creates a diﬃculty for
any quantitative forecasts. For example OECD 2014 (p.12), in a recent study of the social
impact of CERN, states that a qualitative approach is preferred because of possible criticism
of quantitative methods. In a survey of past experience, Martin and Tang (2007, p.15)—while
noting substantial advances in empirical analysis of the diﬀerent channels through which research
expenditures spill over to society—conclude that it is impossible to compare the diﬀerent channels
of propagation of the social beneﬁts of science, or to provide “a quantitative answer to the question
of how the overall level of beneﬁts from basic research compares with the level of public investment
in such research.” They suggest that quantitative forecasts would lead to underestimation of the
beneﬁts, and cite Feller et al. 2002, who report that according to survey data, “ﬁrms investing
in university research do not attempt to make any cost-beneﬁt analysis of this investment on the
grounds that it would be too complex and costly.”

We acknowledge that CBA of research infrastructure is complex and that there is a risk
of underestimation of beneﬁts. Nevertheless, given the importance and the increasing cost of
science, the potential advantages for decision-makers of exploring new ways to measure and
compare social beneﬁts and costs of large-scale research infrastructure cannot be exaggerated.

What follows is an application of the CBA framework developed by Florio and Sirtori
(2015), and Florio et al (2016) and should be seen as a way to explore its feasibility in practice.
There are two important caveats. First, we are not claiming that decisions on funding scientiﬁc
projects should be based exclusively on their measurable socio-economic impact, as there clearly
are several other considerations at stake (the scientiﬁc case itself, strategic and ethical issues,
etc.). Second, our approach is conservative, because it deliberately leaves out several qualitative
evaluation issues. In particular, a novelty of our approach is to make a sharp distinction between
what is measurable and what is not measurable and to focus exclusively on the former. We
shall show that even leaving aside what cannot be predicted in quantitative terms, including the
long-term eﬀect of a discovery, a proper CBA model can still be applied to large-scale research
infrastructure with interesting empirical ﬁndings.

CBA model; section 4 brieﬂy describes data sources and methods; section 5 is about estimation
of costs; section 6 deals with the direct value of publications to scientists; section 7 presents
the social beneﬁts of technological externalities; section 8 considers the human capital eﬀects of
the LHC; section 9 oﬀers a forecast of the cultural eﬀects; section 10 enlarges the scope of the
analysis to non-use beneﬁts; and section 11 concludes.

2 The Large Hadron Collider
The LHC is currently the largest particle accelerator in the world. A particle accelerator is a
device in which particles (protons and atomic nuclei, in the case of the LHC) are accelerated
and made to collide with a target or with each other, with the goal of studying the structure
of matter. Particles are accelerated by subjecting them to electric ﬁelds and are collimated into
focused beams by magnetic ﬁelds. Particle beams travel in a pipe in which a vacuum has been
established and are brought to collide in experimental areas in which the debris from the collisions
is accurately measured by devices called detectors, which allow for an accurate reconstruction of
what has happened during the collision.

The main goal of the LHC is to study the precise nature of the forces that govern fundamental
interactions at the shortest distances that are currently accessible, which requires the colliding
particles to hit each other at the highest possible energy.

In operation since 2009, a ﬁrst goal was reached with the discovery in 2012 of the “Higgs
boson,” at the time the only major missing piece of information in the existing theory of fun-
damental interactions. Current research involves both investigating the properties of the newly
discovered Higgs boson and searches for deviations from the current theory, which is believed to
be incomplete, and is foreseen to continue for at least about another decade.

The LHC was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Construc-
tion work lasted from 1993 to 2008. The LHC is the largest element of a chain of machines
that accelerate particles to increasingly higher energies—the CERN accelerator complex. The
accelerator complex is developed, maintained, and operated by CERN. This facility is exploited
by the experimental Collaborations that perform experiments in the areas where collisions occur.
Each experiment is based on a detector, designed, built, and operated by a Collaboration that
involves both the participation of CERN and of scientists from a number of institutions (univer-
sities and research labs) from several countries. Four main experiments exploit LHC collisions;
the two largest ones both involve several thousand scientists from several hundred institutions in
almost ﬁfty countries. The corresponding detectors are roughly the size of a ten-story building.
When observing particle collisions, the four experiments produce about 1 GB of data per second,
which are either analyzed inside by LHC Collaborations or sent to a number of other computer
centers around the world, connected through the worldwide LHC computer grid.

This context is particularly challenging for cost-beneﬁt analysis for several reasons. First,
this is a very large infrastructure by all measures: number of people involved, physical size,
cost. Also, it has an especially complicated structure due to the intricate interplay of accelerator
and detectors in the experimental Collaborations between the host laboratory (CERN) and its
participating institutions, with the large number of countries and diﬀerent kinds of organizations
involved (universities, research labs, national academies). This poses diﬃcult cost apportionment
and aggregation issues when attempting to estimate costs and beneﬁts.

Second, the life-span (both past and future) of the facility is quite long: this requires both
retrospective evaluation and appraisal techniques, since capital costs for the LHC were incurred
starting from 1993 and the generation of both operating costs and beneﬁts are expected to
continue for some years in the future.

Third, because the LHC is an infrastructure for fundamental research, the evaluation of its

beneﬁts cannot be based on an estimate of the applications of its discoveries.

In view of all this, we will argue that the application of a CBA model to the LHC is a form
of validation of the model itself, in that the successful application of the model in this context
guarantees that the model will be able to handle more conventional or simpler situations, such
as infrastructure of a more applied nature, of a smaller scale, and with a simpler legal and
organizational structure.

3 The model
In general, an investment project passes a CBA test if N P V > 0. If Bti
beneﬁts and costs incurred at various times ti,

N P V =

(cid:88)

i

Bti − Cti
(1 + r)ti

,

and Cti

are respectively

(1)

with r the social discount rate, needed to convert a future value at t in terms of a reference
level at t = 0. We do not explicitly include an expectation operator in this notation, but all the
variables should be considered as stochastic and are taken here at their mean values, given their
probability distribution functions. In turn, B and C include i = 1, 2, . . . , I input and output
ﬂows, each occurring at time t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , T and valued by shadow prices reﬂecting their MSVs
(Drèze and Stern 1987, Florio 2014).

In order to address the evaluation problem quantitatively, we build on the model developed
by Florio and Sirtori (2015), and Florio et al (2016) to which the reader can refer for details
of the approach, including a review of previous related literature. Borrowing some ideas from
environmental CBA (Johansson 1995, Johansson and Kriström 2015, Pearce et al. 2006, Atkinson
and Mourato 2008), Florio and Sirtori (2015) break down the N P V of an RI ( N P VRI) into
two parts: net use-beneﬁts, i.e., net beneﬁts to those who “use”’ in diﬀerent ways the services
delivered by the LHC ( N P Vu); and the present non-use value of the LHC, i.e., its value for
people who currently do not use its services, but who derive utility by just knowing that new
science is created ( Bn), such that:

), and the economic value of beneﬁts (P VBu

N P VRI = N P Vu + Bn = (P VBu − P VCu) + (QOV0 − EXV0) .

(2)
The ﬁrst term on the r.h.s., N P Vu, is the time discounted sum of (negative) capital and op-
), in turn determined by asking
erating costs (P VCu
who the direct beneﬁciaries of the RI are. It is an intertemporal value, i.e., it has the structure
of Eq. (2). The Bn term captures two types of non-use values related to future discoveries: their
quasi-option value ( QOV0) (Arrow and Fisher 1974), which is related to any future, but unpre-
dictable economic beneﬁt of new knowledge; and an existence value (Johansson and Kriström,
2015 p.25), which is related to pure new knowledge per se ( EXV0). Bn is an instantaneous
value, i.e., it refers to time t = 0.

In order to determine N P Vu, here, as in Florio and Sirtori (2015), we ask ﬁrst who the direct
beneﬁciaries of an RI are and thus identify four classes of beneﬁts, related to social groups: (a)
scientists; (b) students and post-docs; (c) ﬁrms in the supply chain of the LHC and other organi-
zations; (d) general public exposed to LHC outreach activities. Starting from (a), the ability to
publish new research ﬁndings is the core beneﬁt to scientists, both project insiders and outsiders
(SC); (b) beneﬁts for students and post-docs in terms of future salary and job opportunities
arise from human capital formation, because of the skills gained and the reputational eﬀects of

their training experience at the RI (HC); technological externalities (c) are beneﬁts to ﬁrms
both in the supply chain of the project procurement and to external ﬁrms involved in technology
transfer and also to other organizations and businesses that save costs because of spillovers from
the research infrastructure activities (T ); (d) cultural eﬀects are enjoyed by outreach beneﬁcia-
ries, including those visiting the facilities and related exhibitions elsewhere, those who access
websites and social media, and those who enjoy the general media exposure of LHC activities
and discoveries (CU). Costs are determined as the sum of the economic value of capital (K),
labor cost of scientists (LS) and other staﬀ (LO), and operating costs (O)1.

Of the two components of the non-use value Bn, the quasi-option value QOV0 is very un-
certain. In principle it would include serendipity eﬀects or any other long-term impacts that
cannot be predicted now in terms of probabilities (Knight 1964). The standard deﬁnition of
QOV in earlier literature is related to irreversibility (the fact that certain projects deﬁnitively
change a site or some stock of resources), uncertainty of demand for alternative projects (for
which probabilities can, however, be guessed), and the value of delaying a decision to acquire
additional information. In fact, Johansson (1995) and Pearce et al. (2006) suggest that QOV
should not be included among the beneﬁts, but considered separately as an information issue.
Moreover, the LHC is already running and our CBA is not fully ex-ante, hence there is no scope
now to evaluate the option to delay the start-up or other technological options (discussed by
Schopper 2009). While in certain domains and for certain research projects it might be possible
in principle to compute a QOV, this does not seem appropriate for the LHC. Nobody can say
ex-ante what is the use-beneﬁt for society of (possibly) discovering supersymmetric particles or
the possible direct uses of the knowledge that the Higgs boson exists. Hence the social cost of
delaying such discovery is fully unknown; also unknown is the direct beneﬁt of having generated
such knowledge before it would have been possible otherwise.

We thus take QOV0 as not measurable for the LHC; we just assume that it is non-negative
and we set it to zero. This is the main conservative assumption of our method of computing the
N P V . We suspect that our assumption implies an underestimation of the social beneﬁts, but
it also has the advantage of removing an immeasurable object from the analysis, an issue that
would otherwise be a source of purely speculative guesses.

However, the existence value EXV0 is measurable in principle.

It is the social beneﬁt of
knowledge per se, without any direct use. This is a pure public good, not conceptually diﬀerent
from other Samuelsonian (non rival, non excludable) global public goods, such as the integral
conservation of natural habitats, of biodiversity, or of cultural heritage, considered separately
from any direct economic exploitation of the protected goods. In environmental CBA, the exis-
tence value is the beneﬁt of preserving something known to exist (European Commission 2014,
Pearce et al. 2006); in the Florio and Sirtori (2015) framework, it is the beneﬁt of knowing that
something exists.

The standard welfare economics theory for a pure public good is that it is socially optimal to
provide such a good when the sum of the willingness to pay (WTP) by taxpayers is equal to the
social cost of provision (Myles 1995, Johansson and Kristöm 2015). Thus, EXV can be proxied
by an empirical estimation of WTP of knowledge per se by the general public. We cannot exclude
the possibility that in eliciting the WTP there may be a mixture of EXV and perceived QOV,
for which however the information is not available to the respondents (see Catalano et al. 2016).
1 In principle, negative externalities and other non-market related eﬀects should also be considered. In the
case of the LHC, we assume that these are either negligible (there is no pollution arising from the infrastructure,
as it is mostly located around one hundred meters underground, and is carefully inspected for radioprotection) or
unpredictable to date (external impact of major accidents or decommissioning costs, as the latter would depend
on technical decisions possibly taken beyond 2040).

In sum, our social accounting2 is

(cid:88)

N P V =

(SCti + T Eti + HCti + CU ti) − (Kti + LSti + LOti + Oti)

i

(1 + r)ti

+ EXV 0.

(3)

Each variable in Eq. (3) is split into several contributions determined by other variables (e.g.,
scientists’ salaries on the cost side, or additional proﬁts of RI suppliers on the beneﬁt side, etc.),
and it is treated as stochastic, as is further explained in the next section.

4 Data and methods
The empirical analysis supporting the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of the LHC is
supported by several sources of data, which are reported in detail below in the presentation of
each cost or beneﬁt item. The main categories are: (a) accounting data and expert analysis of
capital and operating expenditures, including in-kind contributions; (b) scientometric data to
estimate trajectories of publications and their impact in a speciﬁc domain; (c) ﬁrms’ survey data
on technological spillovers expressed in terms of increased sales and cost savings, or increased
proﬁts; expert analysis of the technological content of procurement; company accounting data
for industries involved in procurement; and expert analysis of the cost savings or other quantiﬁ-
able eﬀects of open source software or other technological spillovers; (d) survey data and other
statistical evidence of the expected or ex-post eﬀects on salaries of former students and early
career scientists; (e) statistics about on-site visitors, web access, use of social media, exposure
to traditional media, and data on travel costs, opportunity costs of time, and other information
related to cultural eﬀects; (f) contingent valuation data through survey of samples of potential
taxpayers about their WTP for potential discoveries related to a speciﬁc project.

Financial costs (interest rates arising from borrowing, taxes, and other cash transfers) have
not been included, as they are monetary transactions that do not create value within the society
at the aggregate level. These are not welfare eﬀects, as stated by CBA guidelines adopted by
national and international organizations. They would be part of a ﬁnancial analysis, which is
not our objective. We have also excluded the opportunity cost of public funds, as this would
be related to a marginal eﬀect of distortionary taxation, which for international grants (the
way the LHC is funded) is usually not considered. Moreover, there has been no special grant to
CERN by the Member States for the purpose of building and operating the LHC, which has been
funded by the regular CERN budget, loans, and—for the detectors— by a very large number of
contributions, including in-kind, by CERN member and non-member states (on both issues, see
European Commission 2014).

The data collection required in-depth interviews of more than 1500 people, including PhD
candidates and former LHC students, non-LHC-related students in ﬁve European universities,
experts at CERN and elsewhere, company managers and “head hunters” (i.e., talent recruiters
of CERN students and young researchers), collection and analysis of more than one hundred
documents (mostly internal CERN and Collaboration reports, but also previous technical reports
and research papers), and access to diﬀerent statistical databases, including the analysis of large
samples of company accounts data from the Orbis international dataset (BvD).

The evidence collected has then been structured in the form of a computable model in matrix
form, where each cell corresponds to a beneﬁt or cost variable and a year from 1993 to 2025,
and beyond for certain variables, such as human capital eﬀects. Past missing data in some years
have been estimated and data for future years forecast by simple models, as explained in detail
below.

2 For further details on this model, see Florio and Sirtori (2015).

While in general for past data and for minor items the baseline has been taken as determin-
istic, for the critical forecasts a probability distribution function (PDF) has been assigned, based
either on the sample information or on expert assessment of possible ranges of values around
the baseline. In practice, only some critical variables need to be treated as stochastic (European
Commission 2014). For a total of 19 variables (as reported below in the relevant section) a PDF
has been assumed based on expert data evaluation. To simplify computation, we often assumed
that a normal distribution is adequately proxied by a triangular PDF3 (maximum, minimum,
and mode value, not always with symmetric tails), but in other cases we considered that diﬀerent
distributions were more appropriate. We have tested that in general using (truncated) normal
distributions or other continuous PDFs within a ﬁxed range would not signiﬁcantly change our
results. Finally, we have determined the PDF for the N P V as for Eq. (3) by running a Monte
Carlo simulation (10,000 draws conditional on the stochastic variables).

Monte Carlo methods are the standard approach for the CBA of infrastructure (Eckhardt
1987, Pouliquen 1970, Salling and Leleur 2011, European Commission 2014, Florio 2014) as
they allow estimating the expected value of the variable of interest, with the overall forecasting
accuracy conditional on the residual error of the assumed PDF of the input variables and with
Monte Carlo error that has limit zero for inﬁnite draws. As some decision makers (European
Commission 2014) are accustomed to consider performance variables in the form of the internal
rate of return (IRR, i.e., the value of r such that N P V = 0) or the beneﬁt/cost ratio, we
have run Monte Carlo simulations on these variables as well. Thus, we are able to generate a
conditional PDF of the N P V , the IRR, and the B/C ratio4.

In the next sections, for each contribution on the r.h.s. of Eq. (3) we present our estimation

of the corresponding present value (PV).

5 Costs
LHC costs include past and future capital and operational expenditures born by CERN and the
Collaborations for building, upgrading, and operating the machine and conducting experiments,
including in-kind contributions, for which there exists no integrated accounting. Three categories
of costs have been considered: i) construction capital costs, ii) upgrade capital costs5, and iii)
operating costs. We have estimated CERN costs from the start (1993) up to 2025, while for the
diﬀerent Collaborations (having diﬀerent reporting systems) we have reconstructed costs using
their own ﬁnancial reports, supplemented by our assumptions for years after 2013. Integrated
past ﬂows have been capitalized to t0 = 2013 with a 0.03 social discount rate (in line with
European Commission, 2014). Future costs have been discounted to 2013 euro values by a 0.03
social discount rate as well.

In detail, we have estimated capital and operational expenditures related to LHC as follows.
Budgetary allocations from CERN to LHC have been recovered from data communicated to us
by the CERN Resource Planning Department, drawing from the CERN Expenditure Tracking
(CET) system (account category, type, year, program at 31 March 2014). These data cover all
CERN program and subprogram expenditures in current CHF, from January 1993 to 31 Decem-
ber 2013. The programs include: Accelerators, Administration, Central Expenses, Infrastructure,
Outreach, Pension Fund, Research, and Services. Cost for each program is disaggregated in var-
3 While we mostly use triangular PDF for computational reasons, we have checked that our overall results are

robust if we use other distributions.

4 Details of the MC simulations are available from the authors for all the variables.
5 Only upgrade costs related to the so-called “Phase 1” have been considered, these being sustained to optimize

the physics potential of LHC experiments for operation at higher luminosity.

ious subprograms (e.g., under Accelerators there are 19 subprograms, such as the SPS Complex,
LHC, LEP, General R&D, etc.). In turn, each of these items shows expenditures on materials,
personnel, ﬁnancial costs, and others, broken down into recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure.
We have excluded ﬁnancial costs (such as bank charges and interests) for the reasons explained
in the previous section; we have then identiﬁed the expenditure that can be attributed to the
LHC, rather than other CERN activities.

In many cases, it was necessary to estimate an apportionment share to the LHC of the expen-
diture for each item. To double-check these accounting data, we have interviewed CERN staﬀ in
diﬀerent departments to ask whether the internal reporting actually covered all the expenditures
attributable to the LHC. The results of this data collection process are provided in Table 16.
Some overheads are not recorded in internal reporting as being related to speciﬁc accelerators or
programs. However, as the LHC to some extent increased CERN’s administrative costs, given
the observation of past trends before the start-up of LHC operations, we have attributed 10% of
CERN Administration, Central expenses, Administrative and Technical personnel to the LHC.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of apportioning a higher share of overhead costs to LHC
shows that the N P V remains positive up to a 75% share attributed to LHC, without changing
any other hypothesis. We have identiﬁed scientiﬁc personnel costs of CERN from the reports of
CERN Personnel Statistics, available for each year. The share of this part of the personnel every
year is between 19% in 1993 and 32% in 2013. This share of costs is assumed to balance with the
contribution of CERN scientists to the direct value of the LHC publications, similarly to what
we assume for non-CERN scientists in the Collaborations. We discuss this assumption in detail
in the next section, where we discuss the valuation of scientiﬁc output (publications and other
forms).

To these direct CERN costs we have added past in-kind contributions from member and non-
member states7. We have not included any forecasts of further in-kind contributions in future.
The forecast for 2014-2025 of CERN expenditures has been communicated to us by CERN staﬀ8.
For the expenditures of the Collaborations, we have focused the analysis on the four main
experiments (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb), as the remaining ones (LHCf, FELIX, FP420, HV-
QF, MOEDAL, TOTEM) are comparatively quite small in terms of capital and operating costs.
The beneﬁts of these experiments are also excluded from the computation of the N P V . Our
sources for the main four experiments have been the Resource Coordinators of each Collabo-
ration9. Forecasts of future expenditures of the Collaborations have been based on the same
6 Current CHF values have ﬁrst been accounted in constant 2013 CHF by considering the yearly change
of average consumption prices from IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2013), then expressed in eu-
ros at the exchange rate 1 CHF = 0.812 e (European Central Bank, average of daily rates for year 2013:
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/eurofxref-graph-chf.en.html).

7 These are mainly in the form of equipment made available for free to CERN by third parties and for which
in Annual Accounts (Financial Statements) 2008 (CERN/2840 CERN/FC/5337) a cumulative asset value of 1.47
MCHF is recorded, combining in kind-contribution to the LHC machine and the detectors. The attribution year
by year of this cumulative ﬁgure has been done assuming the same trend as for CERN procurement expenditures.
8 Based on the Draft Medium Term Plan 2014 (personal communication April 2 2014). Again, we have
implemented an apportionment to LHC of each expenditure item. As all values were given to us in constant CHF
2014, these were ﬁrst converted to CHF 2013 and then future values discounted to 2013 levels by the 0.03 rate.
9 We have analysed the expenditure data particularly from these sources: CMS Summary of Expenditure for
CMS Construction for the Period from 1995 to 2008 (CERN-RBB-2009-032); CMS upgrade status report (CERN-
RBB-2014-056); Draft Budget for CMS Maintenance & Operations in the Year 2014 (CERN-RBB-2013-086); Ad-
dendum No. 6 to the Memorandum of Understanding for Collaboration in the Construction of the CMS Detector
(CERN-RBB-2013-070/REV); Addendum No. 7 to the Memorandum of Understanding for Collaboration in the
Upgrade of the CMS Detector (CERN-RBB-2013-127); Addendum No. 8 to the Memorandum of Understanding
for Collaboration in the Upgrade of the CMS Detector (CERN-RBB-2013-128); Memorandum of Understanding
for Maintenance and Operation of the ATLAS Detector (CERN-RBB-2002-035); ATLAS Upgrade Status Report

sources. When only cumulative data at a certain year were available, the yearly distribution has
been interpolated linearly. In the same way, some missing yearly data for the LHCb Collaboration
have been interpolated.

We have not considered the cost implications of new projects—the High Luminosity Project
and of the LHC Upgrade Phase 2—as they mostly will run after our time horizon. To avoid
double counting, the CERN contributions to the Collaborations have been excluded from their
total expenditures. Similarly to what we assume for CERN, the scientiﬁc personnel cost of the
Collaborations (paid by their respective institutes) has been taken as balancing the marginal
cost valuation of the scientiﬁc publications attributed to each experiment and excluded from the
grand total of cost; see the next section regarding this point.

The overall trend of cumulated LHC-related CERN and Collaboration expenditures is shown
in Fig. 1. While we consider the information up to 2013 as given, we treat the forecasts from
2014-2025 as stochastic. We have assumed a normal distribution of the total future cost (2014-
2025) with mean equal to101.97 Ge and a standard deviation compatible with mean ±50% as
asymptotic values. This range is based on in-depth interviews with experts at CERN and analysis
on the most optimistic and pessimistic future cost scenarios11.

Summing up: after including the value of in-kind contributions, we have reconstructed the
time distribution of LHC costs over 1995 to 2008 (see Fig. 1), while CERN costs unrelated to
LHC and costs for future upgrades have been excluded, as their beneﬁts will occur beyond our
time horizon. Our ﬁnal estimate for the expected mean value of the total cost of the LHC over
33 years (1993-2025) is (cid:104)K + LO + O(cid:105) = 13.5 G e, net of scientiﬁc personnel cost12. Here and
in the next sections, the mean value refers always to the outcome of the Monte Carlo process
after 10,000 draws.

6 Beneﬁts to scientists: the value of publishing
We start our discussion of beneﬁts with one that turned out to be small, when properly measured:
the beneﬁt of academic publishing per se. In fact, the core beneﬁt of the LHC to scientists is
the generation of experimental data that sustain the opportunity to publish new research. It is
important to clarify that we are not valuing here the wider social impact of the actual content
of the publications, i.e., of the scientiﬁc value per se or of its future practical use (if any), but
we focus only on the direct eﬀect of publications for science insiders, a special social group.

We brieﬂy elaborate on this issue. The paper by Peter Higgs, introducing in a short paragraph
the theory of a massive boson, was published in 1964, about the same time as papers by other
2013-2014 (CERN-RBB-2014-022); Request for 2014 ATLAS M&O Budget (CERN-RBB-2013-079); Memoran-
dum of Understanding for Maintenance and Operation of the LHCb Detector (CERN-RRB-2002-032.rev-2008);
Addendum No. 01 to the Memorandum of Understanding for the Collaboration in the Construction of the LHCb
detector (CERN/RBB 2012-119A.rev-2014); Status of the LHCb upgrade (CERN-RRB-2014-033); RRB Apr.2014
(CERN-RRB-2014-039); for ALICE data, the source is a personal communication (May 7 2014) comprising data
such as Core Expenditure 2007-2013, Construction costs, including Common Fund, per system, M&O A-budget
and B-budget. Fifteen more reports have been processed by us for the analysis of costs (a detailed list is available

physicists now acknowledged as leading to a similar theoretical prediction. It took nearly 50 years
to conﬁrm this intuition experimentally at the LHC. Nobody currently knows if and when the
theoretical prediction of a new particle decades ago, its recent experimental discovery, and further
precision measurements in future, will lead to any practical application. We know, for example,
that more than one hundred years after the pathbreaking articles by Alfred Einstein (1905 and
1916), practical applications of the theories of special and general relativity, respectively, are now
widespread, e.g., in any GPS device. However, this ex-post (after one hundred years) knowledge
is not helpful to evaluate ex-ante the social impact of a speciﬁc publication, or of any number of
publications: it only suggests that there is a non-zero chance that any substantial new knowledge
will have an economic impact, which seems a reasonable assumption.

Instead, for the scientists, either CERN employees or those hired by the universities and other
institutes participating in the experiments, the direct beneﬁt of publications in principle is mea-
surable by the track record of past publications. In this perspective, the beneﬁt of publications
is proxied by its impact on the scientiﬁc community. This beneﬁt has a limited impact on the
overall balance of the social impact of the LHC. This is not surprising because, ﬁrst, the scientiﬁc
community of high-energy physicists and related ﬁelds is small relative to other social groups;
and because we are not including here the value of knowledge to society per se as embodied in
the publication (see our discussion of non-use beneﬁts for the taxpayers).

The observable demand to publish and to access scientiﬁc publications does not provide a
set of market prices that can be used to estimate the marginal willingness to pay by science
insiders. For example, the subscription prices of journals are usually paid by libraries for their
users, the open source fee for some journals may be paid by research funds, many papers are
available for free (e.g., the more than one million pre-prints available in the ArXiv repository
for physics). The usual alternative to estimating WTP by revealed or stated preferences is the
marginal cost approach to the estimation of beneﬁts (European Commission 2014). Hence, a
publication produced by LHC insider scientists ( L0) has a value that is on average equal (or
not less) to its production costs (scientiﬁc personnel costs). In other words, the marginal social
value of a “statistical” publication is the average marginal cost of producing such a publication.

Assuming linearity of publication production respect to time (which is well documented by the
stability of the average coeﬃcient of number of publications per researcher per year in each ﬁeld—
see Carrazza et al. 2014), this fact has the interesting consequence that the scientiﬁc personnel
cost is balanced by the beneﬁt of the publications. Thus, with a considerable advantage in terms
of estimation of costs and beneﬁts, the two amounts can be assumed to cancel out; and therefore
neither the beneﬁts nor the costs are explicitly included in the CBA. While some evaluator may
try separately to estimate the cost and beneﬁts (in our narrow meaning) of the publications (and
similar products, such as preprints, conference abstracts, etc.) and further reﬁne the analysis,
this estimation in the LHC case would be an overwhelming task, given the large numbers of
scientists involved in the experiments at any point of time (around 10,000).

Hence, we exclude from the beneﬁts the ﬁrst round of publications L0, those from the LHC
insiders, and consider then only the additional beneﬁts arising from papers ( L1) by non-LHC
scientists citing L0 papers, with the direct beneﬁt of further papers (L2) citing L1 papers in
turn considered to be negligible (to be conservative), but including their citations to L1 papers.
We proxy the MSV of L1 papers through the average salary received by an average scientist for
the time spent on doing research and writing a paper. Our forecast of outputs is based on an
estimate of publication trajectories obtained through a statistical model over a period of N = 50
years, starting in 2006. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. We explain below the procedure
in detail.

The past (1993-2012) number of LHC-related scientiﬁc publications L0 (including CERN
and Collaborations) has been extracted from the inSPIRE database (http://inspirehep.net/) by
Carrazza et al. 2014. The data include both published articles and preprints. Citations of these
up to 2012 have been retrieved from the same source. In order to forecast the number EL0 of L0
publications 2013-2025, we have applied a double exponential model (Bacchiocchi and Montobbio
2009, Carrazza et al. 2014). This model is based on a calibration of the publishing trajectory of
the LHC predecessor at CERN, the LEP accelerator. It takes the form:

EL0(t) = α1α2e−β1(T−t)(cid:104)

1 − e−β2(T−t)(cid:105)

,

(4)

• α1 = 65000 is the expected total number of authors of publications during the entire time

span considered;

• α2 = 2 is a proxy of their productivity;
• β1 = 0.18 and β2 = 0.008 are two parameters determining the shape of the curve, based

on the observed pattern of publications related to the LEP;

• T = 50 is the total number of years;
• t = (0, . . ., 50) is the number of remaining years from 2006, the start year of estimations,

to the end of the simulation period (2056).

All the parameters are estimated from the data, except β1 and β2 .

The forecast of the number of L1 publications over the years 2013-2050 has been based on
observed pattern of average number of citations per paper (inSPIRE data), without assuming
any new spike after the one related to the discovery of Higgs boson. This is again a conservative
assumption, because it amounts to saying that nothing of importance will be discovered by the
LHC until 2025.

We have then estimated the citations to L1 papers by L2 papers. Again, the number of L2
papers until 2012 is based on inSPIRE, while to forecast 2013-2050 we assume 4 citations per

Figure 2: Economic value (constant ke 2013) per year of citations to L0 and L1 papers; value
of L1 papers; value of downloads of L0 papers.

paper, in line with the previous years. To these ﬁgures we have added total arXiv downloads for
the ﬁeld of High Energy Physics13, which we used for 1994-2013, while in order to forecast until
2050 we have assumed the same average in future as the past (64 downloads per paper). This
average number of downloads has been applied to L0 papers.

To sum up, the direct beneﬁts for insiders of the science community are thus: the value of
L1 papers; the value of L1 citations and downloads to L0 papers; and the value of L2 citations
to L1 papers. As mentioned, the value of L0 papers cancels out their production cost and it is
not included. The value of L2 papers and beyond, and citations to them, is considered to be
negligible. All values are discounted at the 3% social discount rate.

After the baseline estimations, risk analysis has been performed on the total PV of the
publications. To perform a Monte Carlo simulation, a PDF for the following variables has been
assumed: number of references to L0 papers in papers L1; percentage of time of scientists devoted
to research papers produced per year per average salary of non-LHC scientists; time per download
time per citation.

The resulting total present value of the publications has a mean 277 Me. The value of
publications (net of L0) per se pays back only a tiny fraction of around 2% of the total cost (net
of scientiﬁc personnel costs).

7 Beneﬁts to students and post-docs: human capital formation
We have estimated that beneﬁciaries of human capital formation (Schopper 2009, Camporesi
2001) at the LHC over the time period 1993-2025 include nearly 36,800 early-stage researchers
(ESR): around 19,400 students and 17,400 post-docs (not including participants in summer
schools or short courses). Consistent with the literature on marginal returns to education (see,
e.g., Harmon 2011) the beneﬁt arising from ESR experience at the LHC is valued as the present
value of the LHC-related incremental salary earned over the entire work career (see Fig. 3). This
eﬀect obviously is not the full future salary of former ESR, but it is an estimation of the LHC
“premium” eﬀect on future earnings.

We have considered ﬁve types of ESR: CERN doctoral students; CERN technical students;
CERN fellows; users under 30 years; and users between 30 and 35 years. The sources of data are
the yearly reports of CERN Personnel statistics from 1995 until 2013. We have estimated the
number of incoming students year by year for each type and average stay, based on past data

13 Data have been provided to us by Cornell University Library upon request.

available at the CERN Human Resources Department and from interviews with staﬀ. Future
incoming student ﬂows have been extrapolated from past trends and checked with CERN. The
HR Department records all types of students and post-docs, but we need an apportionment of
these ﬂows to the LHC. We have computed such apportionments with data from the Collabora-
tions and additional interviews at CERN, leading to the following estimates: 30% of the total
ﬂows (for the period 1993-1998); 50% (1999-2001); 70% (2002-2007); and 85% (2008-2025). The
resulting ﬁgures have then been attributed to each of the ﬁve types, based on the historical
distribution, in order to derive the ﬂow of annual incoming students over the years 1993-2025.

Ideally, in order to estimate the economic beneﬁt to each of these types of ESR, we would
have needed a sample of former LHC students of diﬀerent cohorts in their present occupation
and a control group of non-LHC peers. However, given that most of the actual ﬂows of incoming
ESR at the LHC occurred in recent years, i.e., after the startup of experiments in 2008, the
latter information is not available. Hence, our strategy was to make an estimation based on
two samples, respectively of current and former students and post-docs. A survey, directed at
both students and former students, was performed between May and October 2014 and in March
2015 through an on-line questionnaire and direct interviews at CERN. The details of the survey,
including the questionnaire, are available in Catalano et al. (2015a). The survey strategy was to
elicit both expectations of current students at the LHC and evaluations from former students,
now employed in diﬀerent jobs, including outside academia. Information from 384 interviewees
coming from 52 diﬀerent countries has been collected: 75% of respondents are male; 38% are
20-29 years old, 43% are 30-39 years old, the remaining are more than 40 years old; 65% of
respondents are related to the CMS Collaboration and 22% to ATLAS, while the remainder are
in other experiments or LHC-related research at CERN. Each respondent has answered questions
on a number of individual characteristics, his/her perception of the skills acquired at the LHC,
and ﬁnally on an ex-ante (students) or ex-post (former students) perceived LHC premium on
their salary. We assume that former ESR have some knowledge of job market opportunities and
can compare their expectations with those of their peers. We have found that the two sample
averages for the premium eﬀect are strikingly similar, as can be seen in Fig. 3. This suggests
that information on job opportunities and salaries is widespread and convergent (this is, after
all, a relatively small international network of young researchers with close formal and informal
linkages). Given that the former ESR at the LHC have gained actual experience of the post-LHC
career market, we have focused on the premium declared by the respondents who have already
found a job: the sample average is equal to 9.3% .

This percentage premium has been applied to the average annual salary at diﬀerent expe-

by experience level (entry, mid-career, experienced, and late career) for diﬀerent jobs in the
USA14 grouped in four broad sectors:
industry, research centers, academia, others (the latter
including, for instance, ﬁnance, computing, and civil service). A distribution of the number of
CERN students across these broad sectors has been retrieved based on earlier work by Camporesi
(2001) and other sources15. The four aforementioned career points have been interpolated with
a logarithmic function.

Given the average salary in each broad sector, the LHC premium declared by interviewees,
and the above-assumed shares of students ﬁnding a job in each sector, we have computed a
job eﬀect component of the human capital formation beneﬁt. Considering that the diﬀerence

14 See, e.g., http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Electronics Engineer/Salary)
15 For CERN technical students we have assumed that only 10% will go either to research centres or in academia,
and 45% respectively in the other two sectors; for the other students, we have assumed a destination in research
and academia for 60% and 20% each for the others.
Interviews with experts (including “head hunters” who
regularly monitor the CERN students) have conﬁrmed this distribution.

and forecasts. Centre: estimation of future average salaries (left); current employment sector

between the pay in research and academia and the two other sectors combined is between 13%
and 18% (increasing with the level of experience), and that 14% of the former students who
have participated in the survey have been diverted to better-paid jobs in industry or other
sectors (consistent with earlier ﬁndings by Camporesi 2001), an additional small premium of
between 2-3% (triangular PDF with average and mode both equal to 2.5%) has been applied,
because of the composition eﬀect across occupations. The resulting combined 11.8% premium
has been attributed to an average student over a career spanning 40 years, with the implication,
for example, that the cohort of 2025 students will enjoy the beneﬁt up to 2065. Interestingly,
this ﬁgure is well in the range of the returns to higher education in the literature (for a review
of more than 50 years of empirical research, see Montenegro and Patrinos 2014, who ﬁnd the
highest returns for tertiary education). The total number of ESR, in turn, has been taken as a
triangular PDF with maximum and minimum equal to ±15% of the mode and mean, based on
available data. All values are discounted, which, because of the long time span, roughly halves
the cumulative beneﬁt in comparison with its undiscounted value.

The resulting mean value of the corresponding beneﬁts is (cid:104)HC(cid:105) = 5.5 G e. This social
beneﬁt pays back 41% of the total LHC social cost and this is the largest component on the
beneﬁt side.

8 Beneﬁts to ﬁrms and other organizations: technological spillovers
There are two main types of beneﬁciaries of LHC on the business side: ﬁrms in the procurement
chain, because of learning-by-doing eﬀects; and other ﬁrms or professional organizations acquiring

knowledge for free. In both cases, these eﬀects can be described as externalities related to the
transfer of knowledge to third parties outside or beyond any contractual relations with the CERN.
Proﬁts to ﬁrms directly arising from procurement to CERN are part of the LHC costs and are
not considered a social beneﬁt (assuming that there was no idle capacity in the ﬁrms). Thus, the
beneﬁts to LHC-related supplier ﬁrms consist of incremental proﬁts gained through additional
sales to third parties, after the procurement contract with CERN, thanks to technology transfer
and knowledge acquired “for free.” Such eﬀects become particularly important the more co-
designed is the technology, particularly because CERN almost never patents its own inventions,
a famous example being the World Wide Web (Schopper 2009, Boisot et al. 2011). We have
brieﬂy mentioned in section 2 the scope and scale of technological innovation related to building
and maintaining the LHC, in collaboration with a large number of ﬁrms involved (more than
1500, see below).

We have estimated the incremental proﬁts based on LHC-related procurement orders (cate-
gorized according to activity and technological intensity codes), which we forecast up to 2025,
and then used these values to determine incremental turnover for the suppliers through estimates
of economic utility/sales ratios from Bianchi-Streit et al. 1984 and Autio et al. 2003 (based on
surveys to CERN suppliers) and EBITDA margins data (a measure of gross proﬁts/sales ra-
tio) for companies in related sectors, extracted from the ORBIS database (BVD) of companies
balance sheets16 (see Fig. 4).

We explain here the estimation process in some detail. The total value of CERN procurement
by year and by activity code has been recovered from the CERN Procurement and Industrial
Services Companies (personal communication, October 2013). A sample of 300 orders exceed-
ing 10, 000 CHF in nominal value has been extracted from a data set provided to us by the
aforementioned CERN oﬃce. Each sampled order has been classiﬁed (with the help of expert
CERN staﬀ) according to a ﬁve-point scale: 1) “very likely to be oﬀ-the-shelf products with low
technological intensity”; 2) “oﬀ-the-shelf products with an average technological intensity”; 3)
“mostly oﬀ-the-shelf products, usually high-tech and requiring some careful speciﬁcations”; 4)
“high-tech products with a moderate to high speciﬁcation activity intensity to customize product
for LHC”; 5) “products at the frontier of technology with an intensive customization work and
co-design involving CERN staﬀ.” An average technological intensity score has been attributed to
each CERN activity code; we have classiﬁed as high-tech the codes with average technological
intensity class equal or greater than 3. This led to the identiﬁcation of 23 high-tech activity
codes.

Procurement value has then been computed only for orders related to these codes, which
turned out to be 35% of the total of procurement expenditures. This would be only 17% if we
exclude orders below 50, 000 CHF and 58% if we include orders below this threshold and for other
activity codes. We took a triangular distribution with average and mode model equal to 35%
and minimum and maximum as the above range. A share of 84% of yearly total expenditures
of Collaborations is attributed to external procurement, using the same share as CERN. This
share has been used also for the future forecasts of both CERN and the Collaborations up to
2025, based on the previous forecast of cost trends.

For the Collaborations, which are known to include a signiﬁcantly higher share of high-tech
orders, we assume a triangular distribution of the share of high-tech procurement with aver-
age and mode equal to 58% and with minimum set to 40% and maximum to 75%, based on
expert assessment. We have then identiﬁed 1,480 benchmark ﬁrms from the ORBIS database
in the year 2013 and in six countries (Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, UK, USA). These
countries were selected because they received 78% of the total CERN procurement expenditure

16 https://orbis.bvdinfo.com

between 1995 and 201317 . In selecting this sample, we have considered companies whose pri-
mary activity matches with the corresponding CERN activity codes18. After having observed the
EBITDA margin sample distribution, we have computed an average (13.1%) and standard devia-
tion EBITDA, weighted by country, and used these parameters to deﬁne a normal distribution of
the EBITDA. We have then estimated the incremental turnover over 5 years by the LEP average
utility/sales ratio to be equal to 3, based on the results of Bianchi-Streit et al. 1984 and Autio
et al. 2003, which in turn are within the range of other studies as reported in Table 2. Based
on these sources, we assumed a triangular distribution with mode equal to the mean, minimum
1.4, maximum 4.2. This ratio has been applied to the high-tech procurement of both CERN
and Collaborations. We have ﬁnally computed the additional sales times EBITDA margin, thus
estimating the incremental proﬁts of ﬁrms in the LHC supply chain in other markets.

Further beneﬁts to businesses or organizations providing LHC services come from software
developed for analyzing the LHC experimental data and made available for free: ROOT (about
25,000 users in 2013 outside physics, mostly in the ﬁnance sector) and GEANT4 (used, e.g., in
medicine for simulating radiation damage in DNA). The beneﬁts of the externality are estimated
as the avoided cost for the purchase of an equivalent commercial software application (ROOT) or
the cost required for development of an analogous tool (GEANT4). The details of our approach
are as follows.

The number of ROOT users outside the high-energy physics community were estimated on
the basis of yearly download statistics of the software code19 as well as interviews and personal
communications with CERN Physics Department staﬀ. We then forecast future trends based on
extrapolations of calibrated estimates of CERN staﬀ on the basis of past yearly downloads. This
leads to a baseline forecast of 55,000 outside users in 2025. This has been taken as a stochastic
variable with a triangular distribution and a range of ±20% about equal average and mode. The
number of new users by year has been estimated based on data provided by CERN staﬀ. The
market prices of several comparable commercial software codes have then been analyzed. The
range of avoided costs, depending on computing needs, goes from zero (if the R open-source
statistical analysis code was used instead) to 17 ke per year for a one-year license20. We have
assumed a triangular yearly cost-saving PDF for each ROOT user, with average and mode equal
to 1.5ke, minimum set to 1 ke and maximum to 2 ke. Based on interviews with experts, we have
assumed a trapezoidal PDF for the number of usage years, with two modes equal respectively
to 3 and 10; minimum 0; maximum 20, based on actual data inspection. The number of users,
times the avoided cost per year, is then discounted and summed to compute the PV of the
ROOT-related beneﬁt.

For GEANT421 we have identiﬁed about ﬁfty research centers, space agencies, and ﬁrms in
which it is routinely used (not including a substantial number of hospitals that use GEANT4 for
medical applications). Out of this list, we have made a distinction between the 38 centers that
contributed in some form to the development of the code versus the remaining ones. The avoided
cost is based on the production cost of GEANT4 (around 35 Me up to 2013, provided by CERN

staﬀ and generated using SLOCcount22; the total CERN contribution to this cost is estimated
to be 50%. The avoided cost for the aforementioned 38 centers is reduced to the contribution
they actually provided (assumed to be the same for each centre, thus 50% of 35 Me divided by
38), while it is the full GEANT4 cost for the remaining ones. A forecast to 2025 and a yearly
avoided cost has then been estimated. The total cumulated avoided cost has been taken as a
symmetric triangular PDF ±30% about a mode and mean both equal to 2.8 Ge.

To sum up: the total mean value of the technological beneﬁts is (cid:104)T E(cid:105), of which around 62%
arises from open software and the remainder from incremental proﬁts for ﬁrms because of sales
to customers other than CERN. The technological beneﬁts pay back 39% of the total cost.

9 Beneﬁts to the general public: visits to LHC and other direct

cultural eﬀects

There are direct cultural beneﬁts of the LHC to the general public visiting CERN and taking
advantage of its exhibitions, websites, and outreach activities, including their impact on the
media. The general valuation criteria for these beneﬁts has been the revealed preference of the
WTP, estimated in diﬀerent ways. The details of our estimation are as follows.

The key social groups that we have considered are: (a) onsite CERN visitors; (b) visitors
to CERN travelling exhibitions; (c) people reached by media reporting LHC-related news; (d)
visitors to CERN and Collaborations websites; (e) users of LHC-related social media (YouTube;
Twitter; Facebook; Google+); (f) participants in two volunteer computing programs.

(a) Beneﬁts for on-site visitors are determined using the revealed preference method (Clawson
and Knetsch 1966), with the MSV of the time spent in travelling obtained from HEATCO23
data (see Fig. 5). Data for onsite visitors since 2004 to 2013 have been provided to us by the
Communication Groups of CERN and by each Collaboration. The forecast to 2025 has been
extrapolated by a constant yearly value, based on the trend observed in the previous years. We
have estimated an 80% overlap between visitors to LHC experiment facilities and the permanent
CERN Exhibitions (Microcosm and Universe of Particles in the Globe of Science and Innovation);
moreover, only 80% of visitors to CERN have been attributed to the LHC.

The value of travelers’ time is based on HEATCO for each member state and for some non-
members. Based on the distribution of visitors by country and mode of transportation, we have
estimated an overall distribution of visitors based on the following PDF: trapezoid distribution
for air travelers (minimum equal to 5; maximum equal to 45, ﬁrst mode equal to 22 and second

Right: beneﬁts to personal, visitors, social media users and website visitors. The valuation of the
beneﬁt is based on the segmentation of visitors in three areas of origin with increasing distance
from CERN (see Fig. 5), and by average travel costs for each zone, based on seven origin cities
taken as cost benchmarks. For each zone, a transport mode combination and length of stay have
been assumed (see Fig. 5). The three zones and the share of visitors for each zone are based on
data provided by the CERN Communication Group (personal communication October 2013);
additional costs have been estimated including for accommodation and meals (data extracted
from the CERN website).

mode equal to 27, all in e/hour: there are two modes because of the diﬀerence between the two
main origin groups and this suggests using a trapezoid PDF); triangular distribution for travel
by car and train (mean and mode equal to 18; minimum 6 and maximum 30).

(b) For the CERN travelling exhibitions, we have used the number of past visitors as provided
by CERN (between 30,000 and 70,000 for the period 2006-2013). We have assumed a constant
number of 40,000 visitors per year during from 2014 to 2035. The WTP is prudentially assumed
to be just 1 e per visitor (assuming local transport).

(c) For the beneﬁt of LHC coverage in the media, we have conservatively considered only
the news spikes on September 10 2008 (ﬁrst run of LHC) and July 4 2012 (announcement of
the discovery of the Higgs boson)24. We have estimated, based on some interviews, that the
average time devoted to each LHC news per head is 2 minutes. We have treated the audience
number as a stochastic variable, assuming a triangular distribution (minimum zero, maximum
one billion, average and mode equal to 0.5 billion). The value of time of the target audience has
been estimated based on current GDP per capita in the average CERN Member States and the
USA (for 2013, using IMF data), and the number of working days per year (8 hours times 225
working days). This is treated as a stochastic, triangular distribution, with minimum equal to
3 e; maximum 42 e, and mode and mean equal to 17 e.

(d) We have estimated the number of website visitors on the basis of historical data on
hits until 2013-2104 (source CERN and Communication Groups in the main Collaborations).
Our forecast is conservatively based in assuming that the value at the last available observation
remains constant. The beneﬁt comes from the number of minutes per hit from users of the
websites, estimated to be a triangular distribution with average and mode equal to 2 minutes,
and ranging from 0 to 4 minutes.

(e) Further beneﬁts come from LHC-related social media and website visits, with the MSV of
time of the general public proxied by the hourly value of per capita GDP (see Fig. 5). For social
media usage, we recovered data provided by CERN and Collaborations, attributing to the LHC
80% of the hits to CERN-related social media and 100% of those related to the Collaborations.
We used historical data until 2014 and for the subsequent years we have taken the last year’s data
as constant. The average stay time is assumed for all social media to be distributed according to
a triangular distribution with average and mode equal to 0.5 minutes per capita, ranging from
zero to one minute. Time is then valued as above.

(f) Finally, some CERN projects exploit computing time donated from volunteers to run
simulation of particle collisions, with WTP revealed by time spent. Two such LHC-related
programs are SIXTRACK and TEST4THEORY, where outsiders donate to CERN the machine
time and capacity of their own computers and are then able to access some data and to join a
social network. The stock number of volunteers in 2013 has been provided by the CERN PH
Department (personal communication); based on this information, we have assumed a rate of
increase from the program start years (respectively 2007 and 2001). A forecast of the future
volunteer stock has been given to us to 2025 by the same source; again, we have assumed a
yearly rate of change over the years 2014-2025. The opportunity cost is the time to download,
install, and conﬁgure the programs (15 minutes per capita una tantum) and the time spent in
forum discussions (15 minutes per month per capita). Again, time is valued as above.
The total mean value of the above mentioned cultural eﬀects is (cid:104)CU(cid:105) = 2.1 Ge. This value

contributes around 16% against the total cost.

10 Non-use beneﬁts: scientiﬁc knowledge as a public good
As mentioned in section 2, beyond the direct beneﬁts accruing to certain social groups, there is
a non-rival and non-excludable beneﬁt, i.e., a public good arising from the LHC’s discoveries.
This is not connected to any speciﬁc use of such discoveries, but only to the social preference for
knowing that such new knowledge will be available; this is a non-use value:

“A resource or a service might be valued even if it is not consumed. Such values are referred
to as non-use values, bur sometimes they are labeled passive-use or intrinsic values.
If
the project being evaluated aﬀects non-use values this should be reﬂected in the cost-beneﬁt
analysis . . . among these are existence values” (Johansson and Kriström, 2015, pp 24-25).

The empirical estimation of non-use value in environmental and cultural economics is gener-
ally based on contingent valuation approaches and their variants. The issue is discussed in some
detail in Florio and Sirtori (2015). The benchmark methodology in the literature is the NOAA
1993 panel (Arrow et al. 1993), but there have been several advances since then (see Carson
2012 for a review and Johansson and Kriström, Ch. 9). We wish to determine social preferences
for the non-use value of LHC discoveries, a public good with yet unknown practical use.

. . .

We have thus designed a contingent valuation study tailored to our problem.

Ideally, a
random sample of taxpayers in the CERN Member States and in other countries (e.g., notably
the USA) supporting the LHC in diﬀerent forms would be needed. An in-depth survey, as
recommended by the NOAA panel, needs personal interviews of a representative sample of the
population, but in our case spreading a manageable sample across many countries and types
of individuals would be too costly and not necessarily more reliable than performing a more
focused survey. Hence, we have targeted university students for in-depth personal interviews
in four CERN Member States as representative of future taxpayers with tertiary education.
Referring to students in experimental economics and political science is common practice (see,
e.g., Druckman and Kam 2011). In fact, to be conservative, we have assumed that all taxpayers
with less than tertiary education would be willing to contribute nothing to scientiﬁc discovery by
the LHC as a pure public good. Surely, in this way, we grossly understate the social preferences,
as at least some people with less than tertiary education may have a positive WTP. The results
were used to guess the WTP of taxpayers with tertiary education in CERN Member States and
from non-Member States.

This survey on WTP for the LHC-related public good was undertaken in Milan in October-
November 2014 and in Exeter (UK), Paris (France), and A Coruña (Spain) in February-March

2015: 1027 questionnaires were collected. The average time spent answering the questionnaire
(28 questions) was about 25 minutes25. The respondent was ﬁrst given a one-page summary of
the LHC Wikipedia page as an information set. The geographical distribution of respondents
was 40% from Italy and 20% each from Spain, France, and the UK. Out of the total number
of respondents, 85% were 19-25 years old, while the remainder were more than 26 years old.
Out of the respondents 57% were females. A share of 64% were in the humanities and social
sciences, with the remainder in science-related curricula. Questions included: household compo-
sition, family income, personal income, high-school background, previous knowledge of research
infrastructure, source of information, if any, on the LHC and the Higgs boson discovery, whether
the respondent has ever visited CERN, interest in science, willingness to pay for LHC research
activities a ﬁxed lump-sum or a yearly economic contribution over 30 years, in pre-set discrete
amounts (zero, 0.5, 1, 2 e)26. Only answers to the last question (yearly contribution) are used
here, while all the other variables have been used for a detailed statistical analysis by Catalano
et al (2016).

We have then taken the sample average yearly WTP, weighted by the number of respondents
by country, for only those respondents who declared a positive annual WTP, these comprising
73% of the total. This has given us a sample distribution with three discrete values (0.5, 1,
and 2 e), and mode and maximum equal to 2. Each annual WTP has then been multiplied
(undiscounted, as this is an instant variable) by 30 years. This per capita WTP has been applied
to 73% of respondents between 18-74 years of age with at least tertiary education coming from
CERN Member States, determined by data from Eurostat 2013 (see Fig. 6). We have then added
to the previous target population an additional 21% from CERN non-member states, reﬂecting
the share of onsite visitors to CERN from non-member states (visitor statistics provided by
CERN staﬀ as a personal communication). We have treated the per capita WTP as a stochastic
variable, assuming a truncated triangular probability distribution with maximum and mode equal
to 2 e and minimum equal to 0.1 e, reﬂecting the sample distribution for non-zero values.

The undiscounted mean non-use value is found to be (cid:104)EXV0(cid:105) = 3.2 Ge, paying back around

24% of total costs.

11 Summary of results and concluding remarks
Based on the forecasts of social costs and beneﬁts in the previous sections, we have determined
the probability distribution of the net present value of the LHC as for Eq. (3) by running a Monte
Carlo simulation (10,000 draws conditional to the PDF of the nineteen stochastic variables men-
tioned above27). Each draw generates an N P V estimate in a state of the world supported by a
random set of the possible values taken by the model stochastic variables. The number of vari-
ables we have considered for the Monte Carlo simulation and the number of draws are largely
in excess of what is usually done in the evaluation of large-scale investment projects by interna-
tional and national bodies (Florio 2014, OECD 2015), e.g., for high-speed rail infrastructure that
faces considerable uncertainty and optimism bias (Flyvbjerg et al. 2003). While we have been
prudent, and even pessimistic, in our assumptions, caution is necessary in the interpretation of
the ﬁnal results, which we will brieﬂy summarize and discuss here. As with any forecast covering

25 For the questionnaire and other details, see Catalano et al. 2016.
26 As we did not consider a higher range of values, this truncates the right tail of the distribution in such a way
that in fact we are underestimating the WTP. To double-check the preferences, the questionnaire included also a
question on the WTP a lump sum contribution of 30 euros in a “referendum-like” format, as recommended by the
NOAA panel and in Catalano et al. (2016); we use this alternative “referendum” question format to double-check
the results reported here.

the long run, there is obviously some residual uncertainty, but we are conﬁdent that residual
estimation errors are mostly in the direction of underestimating the net social beneﬁt of the
LHC. This was deliberate, as we have preferred to be conservative.

The total present value to 2025 of operating and capital expenditure of the LHC is estimated
at 13.5 Ge (net of the cost of scientiﬁc personnel). In terms of contributions to the sum of the
social beneﬁts (16.4 Ge), the present value of the human capital eﬀects and of technological
spillovers are the most important ones, and of similar size, each contributing around one third
of the beneﬁts. Adding the tiny secondary eﬀect of the publications (net of the direct value
of LHC research outputs), around 68% of the socio-economic beneﬁts is related to professional
activities (within ﬁrms, academia, and other organizations), while the remaining beneﬁts spill
over to the general public, either as a direct cultural eﬀect (a private good) or as a pure public
good (a non-use beneﬁt). Any other (if any) unpredictable social beneﬁts of future applications
of scientiﬁc discoveries at the LHC are excluded from our analysis; they will remain as an extra
bonus for future generations, donated to them by current taxpayers.

The ﬁnal PDF and cumulative probability distribution for the N P V are shown in Fig. 7.
We ﬁnd that the expected N P V of the LHC is around 2.9 Ge, with a conditional probability
of a negative N P V smaller than 9% with a 3σ Monte Carlo error below 2%. The expected
beneﬁt/cost ratio is around 1.2 and the expected internal rate of return is 4.7% 28.

We have thus shown how a social CBA probabilistic model can be applied to evaluate a
large-scale research infrastructure project, based on empirical methods. The main novelty of this
contribution is that we show the feasibility, following the Florio and Sirtori (2015) approach, of
a quantitative valuation of the socio-economic impact of such infrastructure in a way consistent
with ﬁrst principles of applied welfare economics. The way we respectively deﬁne and apply
the distinction between the use and non-use beneﬁts of research infrastructures, and of the
measurable and non-measurable impacts, are also novel relative to the previous literature, as
discussed in Florio and Sirtori (2015). Moreover, our treatment of risk, while based on standard
Montecarlo methods, shows a way to forecast some stochastic variables typical of a CBA model
28 The N P V would be lower if an opportunity cost of public funds is considered because of distortionary
taxation, but it would still be positive for the typical current range in developed countries. In fact, European
Commission (2014) does not recommend introducing a correction for the opportunity cost of public funds for
projects funded by grants supported by international transfers, because it would not be clear which is the relevant
source of funding. For example, if it is sovereign debt in Europe, for most of the core Member States of the CERN
the real interest rate on such debt for 30 years bonds would be largely below the social discount rate that we
use and below the long-term rate of growth of GDP. A sensitivity analysis can ascertain the relative impact of
lowering the social discount rate and of increasing the total cost by a correction factor related to the opportunity
cost of public funds, but we leave this and other sensitivity analysis issues for further research.

Clearly the LHC is a special, albeit important case of an RI, because of the long time of
construction and operation, the high number of scientists, students and post-docs involved, the
large number of ﬁrms in the supply chain, the externalities from the open access to software,
the wide coverage in the media and the attraction of onsite visitors, and the nature of a frontier
basic research facility. However, we believe that the role of a case study in social science is to
suggest new avenues of inquiry. As stated by Flyvbjerg (2006 p.219):

“A scientiﬁc discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a disci-
pline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an
ineﬀective one.”

It would hence be necessary to expand further the evaluation of the socio-economic impact
of RIs to other large-scale facilities, including those in applied science. An example of the latter
is a recent study of the CNAO particle accelerator for hadron therapy (Pancotti et al. 2015),
which uses, in the context of medical research, the same methodology we apply here. The
proportion and scale of the costs and beneﬁts may be diﬀerent elsewhere, but we believe that
the main ingredients of a CBA of research infrastructure are well represented in the LHC case;
hence replication can be attempted if data are available. Further studies on a range of diﬀerent
facilities, in diﬀerent science and technology domains, and in diﬀerent countries, are needed to
conﬁrm our intuition.
