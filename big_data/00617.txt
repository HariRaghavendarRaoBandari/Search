Removing the stabilization parameter

in ﬁtted and unﬁtted symmetric

Nitsche formulations

Christoph Lehrenfeld ∗

March 3, 2016

In many situations with ﬁnite element discretizations it is desirable or nec-
essary to impose boundary or interface conditions not as essential conditions –
i.e. through the ﬁnite element space – but through the variational formulation.
One popular way to do this is Nitsche’s method. In Nitsche’s method a stabi-
lization parameter λ has to be chosen “suﬃciently large” to provide a stable
formulation. Sometimes discretizations based on a Nitsche formulation are
criticized because of the need to manually choose this parameter. While in the
discontinuous Galerkin community variants of the Nitsche method – known as
“interior penalty” method in the DG context – are known which do not require
such a manually chosen stabilization parameter, this has not been considered
for Nitsche formulations in other contexts. We introduce and analyse such a
parameter-free variant for two applications of Nitsche’s method. First, the
classical Nitsche formulation for the imposition of boundary conditions with
ﬁtted meshes and secondly, an unﬁtted ﬁnite element discretizations for the
imposition of interface conditions is considered. The introduced variants of
corresponding Nitsche formulations do not change the sparsity pattern and
can easily be implemented into existing ﬁnite element codes. The beneﬁt of
the new formulations is the removal of the Nitsche stabilization parameter
λ while keeping the stability properties of the original formulations for a
“suﬃciently large” stabilization parameter λ.

1 Introduction

Nitsche’s method was originally introduced in [1] and has been applied in many diﬀerent
contexts in order to weakly enforce interface or boundary conditions. The idea is to

impose boundary or interface conditions not into the ﬁnite element space as essential
condition but to change the variational formulation to achieve the condition at least in a
weak sense. For the boundary value problem −∆u = 0 in Ω with u|∂Ω = 0 the classical
Nitsche variational formulation is: Find u ∈ Vh such that

∂Ω

uv ds = 0 ∀ v ∈ Vh,

where Vh is a ﬁnite element space with Vh ⊂ H 1(Ω) and ∂nvh ∈ L2(∂Ω) for all vh ∈ Vh.
Here h is the characteristic mesh size and λ is a parameter that has to be chosen suﬃciently
large. The criticism on Nitsche’s method is sometimes related to this parameter λ and
the “suﬃciently large” condition. Although theoretical error analyses can give a precise
lower bound on the choice of λ in practice the parameter is typically chosen by estimating
the order of magnitude or a trial and error approach. If the parameter is chosen too
small, the formulation gets unstable. If however the stabilization parameter is chosen too
large the condition number of the system matrix increases and error bounds degenerate.
A suitable choice for λ is speciﬁcally diﬃcult if problems with a large contrast in the
diﬀusion parameter are considered.

In this paper we focus on unﬁtted ﬁnite element discretizations with a weak enforcement
of interface or boundary conditions with a symmetric Nitsche-type formulation.
In
unﬁtted ﬁnite element methods a computational mesh is used which is not aligned to
the geometries with respect to which a solution to a PDE should be approximated. We
consider an elliptic interface problem with an unﬁtted interface. To transition into this
problem we also consider the model problem which has been considered in the original
paper [1], a Poisson problem on domain with a ﬁtted boundary.

We give a brief overview on the literature of ﬁtted and especially unﬁtted discretizations
using Nitsche’s method. Nitsche’s method has a close relation to (stabilized) Lagrange
multiplier methods. This connection allows to derive suitable Nitsche formulations from
stabilized Lagrange multiplier formulations and has been nicely discussed in [2, 3, 4].

While we want to focus on symmetric Nitsche-type formulations we mention the
papers [5, 6, 7] which investigate non-symmetric Nitsche formulations and get rid of
the “suﬃciently large” condition on λ, [5], or the whole penalty term, [6, 7]. We aim at
achieving the same goal with a symmetric formulation.

Many discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes – especially the (symmetric) interior
penalty method [8] – have a very close relation to Nitsche’s method. The continuity of
the solution is not build into the ﬁnite element space but has to be implemented by the
variational formulation. For DG schemes for elliptic problems many variants are known,
cf. [9] for an overview of diﬀerent methods. Among them there exist versions which get
rid of the parameter λ and are able to provide consistency, continuity, symmetry and
stability. The approach discussed in this paper is in the same virtue as the DG method
presented in [10, 11] and analyzed in [12].

For unﬁtted interface problems a stable Nitsche formulation has been introduced in
the original paper [13]. One important aspect of this method is the choice of a geometry-
dependend averaging operator which is crucial for stability. We detail on this method
below. Many discretization are based on this formulation, for instance [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

problems (left) and an unﬁtted interface problem (right).

The major contribution of this paper is the introduction of new ﬁnite element for-
mulations for the weak imposition of boundary and interface conditions for ﬁtted and
unﬁtted meshes. These new formulations inherit the stability from known Nitsche-type
formulations but remove the stabilization parameter λ.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we introduce notation for Nitsche-type
formulations and their analysis. Based on a common framework we present Nitsche-type
formulations from the literature and discuss their theoretical properties in Section 3.
Modiﬁed formulations which get rid of the penalty parameter λ are then introduced and
discussed in Section 4. The modiﬁed formulations involve a lifting operator. That an
implementation of this lifting operator is practically feasible is shown in Section 5.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Problem classes

We consider two classes of problems on which Nitsche’s method is applied, cf. Fig. 1. A
Boundary value problem with a boundary-ﬁtted mesh and an elliptic interface problem
with an interface-unﬁtted mesh. In Section 3 we introduce suitable Nitsche-type ﬁnite
element formulations which are known to be stable for both problems. To provide stability
diﬀerent versions of trace inverse inequalities play an important role. The stability of the
classical Nitsche method for the model problem can be shown based on standard trace
inverse inequalities for polynomials. For the interface problem with an interface-unﬁtted
mesh a special weighting in the Nitsche method is required to obtain a similar result.

Remark 1. We do not consider the case of an interface problem with a ﬁtted mesh as
the same techniques as for the Poisson problem with a boundary-ﬁtted mesh can directly
be carried over. Further the case of an unﬁtted boundary value problem is not consider.
Existing stable Nitsche-type formulations for this problem introduce a second stabilization
term with a second stabilization parameter, cf. [19]. With the techniques discussed in
this paper it is not clear how to remove also this parameter.

2.2 Uniﬁed notation for Nitsche formulations
In both cases we assume to have a domain ˜Ω on which a shape regular simplex tri-
angulation Th is available. Throughout the paper we assume quasi-uniformity with a
characteristic mesh size h. This restriction simpliﬁes the presentation but is not essential
and can be generalized by exchanging h with a localized version, hT , a characteristic

with bilinear and linear forms which are yet to be deﬁned. Here, the bilinear form a(·,·)
is responsible to provide consistency with respect to the volume terms, i.e. the inner
part of the domain(s). The bilinear form N c(·,·) is responsible for the consistency w.r.t.
boundary terms stemming from partial integration of the elliptic operator. The second
term which involves N c(·,·) is added for symmetry (or adjoint consistency) reasons.
Finally N s(·,·) is a term added to provide stability. In the standard formulation, we have

N s(·,·) = N s

2.3 Analysis of (symmetric) Nitsche formulations

The analysis of corresponding Nitsche’s methods uses standard arguments. With coerciv-
ity, continuity and consistency of the bilinear form w.r.t. suitable spaces and norms a
C´ea-like Lemma can be obtained. We brieﬂy introduce the three criteria – in terms of
the equations (A)-(D) below – together with the notation for the involved norms and
spaces. The criteria are fulﬁlled for both formulations mentioned below.
We use the notation a (cid:46) b (a (cid:38) b) if there exists a constant c independent of
discretization or material parameters such that a ≤ cb (a ≥ cb). If a (cid:46) b and a (cid:38) b we
write a (cid:39) b.

Coercivity The crucial component with respect to the stabilization parameter λ is
coercivity. For suﬃciently large λ all considered Nitsche formulations provide that the
following holds:

A for all uh ∈ Vh with |||v|||A :=(cid:112)a(v, v) + N s(v, v).

A(uh, uh) (cid:38) |||uh|||2

(A)

In the analysis a stronger norm is needed to bound the ﬂux terms in the bilinear form
N c(·,·). We denote this norm by |||·||| and require that there holds

|||vh||| (cid:39) |||vh|||A for all vh ∈ Vh,

(B)

so that (A) yields A(uh, uh) (cid:38) |||uh|||2 for all uh ∈ Vh.

4

Continuity On the space Vh + Vreg with Vreg so that A(u, v) (especially N c(u, v)) is
well-deﬁned for u, v ∈ Vreg we then have continuity in the sense that

A(u, v) (cid:46) |||u||| |||v||| u, v ∈ Vh + Vreg.

(C)
Consistency With u ∈ Vreg the solution of the original problem and uh ∈ Vh the solution
to the discrete one, we demand Galerkin orthogonality, i.e.
A(u − uh, vh) = 0 for all vh ∈ Vh.

(D)

With these consistency, continuity and coercivity results we have a version of the

well-known C´ea Lemma:
Lemma 1. Let u ∈ Vreg be the solution to the original problem and uh ∈ Vh the solution
to the discrete one. If the equations (A)-(D) are fulﬁlled, then there holds

|||u − uh||| (cid:46) inf
vh∈Vh

|||u − vh|||.

(2)

Below, in Section 4 we propose an alternative to the stabilization form (1) of the form

N s(·,·) = N s

nn(·,·) + N s

1 (·,·)

where N s

nn(·,·) is responsible to provide non-negativity in the sense that

A(u, u) − N s

1 (u, u) (cid:38) a(u, u)

1 (·,·) is only required to provide that A(·,·) induces
which implies (A) with λ = 1. Then, N s
a norm. The scaling of this term is however independent of any stability requirement.
In the following section we specify the problem classes and the bilinear forms, spaces
and norms corresponding to suitable discretization which are known to be stable (for
suﬃciently large λ).

3 Stable Nitsche formulations

In the following subsections we will introduce suitable discretizations for the considered
problems and show the conditions (A)-(D).

3.1 Nitsche formulation for a boundary value problem with a

body-ﬁtted mesh

In the ﬁtted case we have ˜Ω = Ω and the model problem is
− ∆u = f in Ω, u = g on ∂Ω

(3)

In this case the Nitsche’s method, as introduced in [1], takes the form of (N) with

a(u, v) = (∇u,∇v)Ω, N c(u, v) = (−∂nu, v)∂Ω and N s(u, v) = N s

λ(u, v) =

λ
h

(v, v)∂Ω.

5

We brieﬂy verify (A)-(D) with respect to suitable spaces and norms. As the ﬁnite element
space Vh we consider a standard ﬁnite element space of continuous piecewise polynomials
up to degree k. The stronger norm on Vh + Vreg with Vreg = H 2(Ω) is

|||u|||2 = |||u|||2

A + h(cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2
∂Ω,

and continuity on Vh + Vreg with respect to |||·||| follows directly with Cauchy-Schwarz, so
that we have (C). Consistency follows directly from partial integration, so that also (D)
holds. An essential estimate to prove (A) is the following trace inverse inequality:

h(cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2

∂Ω∩T ≤ h(cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2

∂T ≤ ctr(cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2
T ,

u ∈ P k(T ), T ∈ Th

with a constant ctr only depending on the shape regularity of the element T and the
polynomial degree k, cf. [20]. Assuming that ctr denotes the upper bound of the shape
regularity constant on all elements in the mesh, then we can easily show (B) and the
estimate

2N c(uh, uh) ≤ 2h

from which we deduce (A) for λ suﬃciently large ( for instance λ > 16ctr).

3.2 Nitsche formulation for an interface problem with an unﬁtted

mesh

For the case of an unﬁtted interface we assume ˜Ω = Ω but have an additional internal
interface Γ ⊂ Ω which separates Ω into two disjoint sub-domains Ω1 and Ω2 which are
unﬁtted, i.e. not aligned with the mesh. Inside the domains only diﬀusion takes place,
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient α may however be discontinuous across the interface Γ. On the
boundary we consider homogeneuous Dirichlet conditions to be implemented as essential
conditions. This simpliﬁes the presentation. For a weak imposition of the boundary
conditions, we refer to the treatment of the case in section 3.1. At the interface two
conditions are posed: continuity of the solution and conservation of the ﬂux.

− α∆u = f in Ωi,

u = 0 on ∂Ω,

[[u]] = 0 on Γ,

[[−α∂nu]] = 0 on Γ.

(5)

In unﬁtted FEM a famous formulation of the problem goes back to the original paper
[13]. The ﬁnite element space depends on Γ and is deﬁned as Vh = V 1
h where
h = Wh|Ωi is the ﬁctitious domain ﬁnite element space related to domain Ωi with the
V i
underlying standard ﬁnite element space Wh which again is the space of continuous
piecewise polynomial functions. The variational formulation proposed in [13] can be
casted into the form of (N) with
a(u, v) = (α∇u,∇v)Ω1∪Ω2, N c(u, v) = ({{−α∂nu}}, [[v]])Γ and N s(u, v) =
([[u]], [[v]])Γ.
where [[·]] is the usual jump operator across the interface Γ. The averaging operator {{v}} =
κ1v|Ω1 +κ2v|Ω2 takes an important role to provide stability. With Vreg := H 2(Ω1)∪H 2(Ω2)

and the norm |||u|||2 = |||u|||2
Γ one easily shows (C) and (D). It remains to
show (A) and (B). In the following we assume that a stable weighting is used, so that
the following inverse estimate holds:
Γ∩T ≤ ctrαi(cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2

u ∈ P k(Ti), Ti := T ∩ Ωi,

for a constant ctr only depending on the shape regularity of T (not Ti!), the polynomial
degree k and the diﬀusion parameter αi. We note that a carefully chosen stabilization
parameter λ in N s(u, v) = N s
λ(u, v) scales with ctr and hence with the diﬀusion parameter
α.
For piecewise linears (k = 1) and the weighting κi = |Ti|/|T| the inverse inequality has
been proven in [13]. For higher order discretizations we refer to the discussion of weightings
that lead to stable discretizations in [21, Remark 6]. Analogously to the estimates in (4)
this allows to prove (A) and (B). Together with the optimal approximation properties of
Vh, see also [13], we can obtain optimal order error bounds provided that λ is chosen
suﬃciently large.

4 Modiﬁed formulations to remove the parameter λ

by an index T , e.g. aT (·,·), so that a(·,·) =(cid:80)

In the following we introduce a new stabilization bilinear form based on a lifting operator
and reestablish (A)-(D) with this new parameter-free stabilization term and λ = 1 in the
penalty term. For the formulations in the Sections 3.1-3.2 the bilinear forms a(·,·), N c(·,·)
and N s(·,·) can easily be decomposed into element contributions which are indicated
aT (·,·). We introduce and analyse
the modiﬁed formulation for the ﬁtted Poisson case and afterwards translate it to the
unﬁtted interface problem.

T∈Th

4.1 The modiﬁed formulation for the ﬁtted Poisson problem
The discrete local lifting operator L(·)
On elements which are located at the boundary we introduce an element-wise lifting into
the space of polynomials which are orthogonal to constants, P k
0 (T ) := P k(T ) \ P 0(T ).
The lifting is deﬁned element-wise as

LT : H 1(T ) → P k

aT (LT (u), v) = N c

T (v, u) ∀v ∈ P k

0 (T ),

LT (u) ⊥ P 0(T ) and LT (u) = 0 if u|∂Ω∩T = 0. We redeﬁne a(u, v) :=(cid:80)

(6)
We note that LT is an element-local operator and that (6) also holds for v ∈ P k(T )
as aT (·, w) = N c
T (w,·) = 0 for w ∈ P 0(T ). Further, by construction there holds
aT (u, v) with
aT (u, v) = (∇u,∇v)T , i.e. in a broken sense so that a(·,·) is also well deﬁned for only
element-wise H 1(T ) functions. On elements which are not located at the boundary we
set LT (·) = 0 and deﬁne the global lifting

0 (T )

Note that in general L(u) is discontinuous across element interfaces. With the deﬁnition

of the lifting we have a(L(u), v) = N c(v, u) for all v ∈ V disc

Analysis of the modiﬁed Nitsche formulation for ﬁtted boundary value problems
The lifting allows to characterize the nonsymmetric term N c(·,·) in terms of the symmetric
bilinear form a(·,·) and the lifting operator applied on one of the arguments. This
characterization will help to control N c(·,·) in terms of a(·,·) and a new symmetric
bilinear form involving the lifting. We exploit this in the following central result.

Lemma 2. The bilinear form
Ann(u, v) := a(u, v) + N c(u, v) + N c(v, u) + 2a(L(u),L(v))
,

is non-negative in Vh and there holds Ann(uh, uh) ≥ 1
Proof. Consider uh ∈ Vh. Then with Young’s inqualitywe have
2N c(uh, uh) = 2a(L(uh), uh) ≤ 2a(L(uh),L(uh))+

control on the semi-norm(cid:112)a(u, u). In order to have control of a reasonable norm, i.e.

nn(u, v) is well deﬁned on H 1(Ω). The bilinear form Ann(u, v) only oﬀers
1 (·,·). Note
in order to have control on the boundary values, we add the bilinear form N s
however that we can choose λ = 1 (or any other positive number) as the only purpose of
this part is to add control on the boundary integral. Due to the lifting part in a(L(·),L(·))
λ(·,·) is no longer needed to control the non-symmetric terms N c(·,·).

With

1 (·,·)

A∗(u, v) := A(u, v) as in (N) with N s(·,·) = 2a(L(·),L(·)) + N s
we can directly conclude the following corollary from which (A) follows.

Consistency in the form of (D) immediately follows from the fact that L(u) = 0 for
u|∂Ω = 0. One might get the impression that the trace inverse inequality constant ctr does
not play a role in the formulation with A∗(·,·). That this is not true becomes obvious if
we investigate the continuity of the bilinear form a(L(·),L(·)). We have
aT (L(u),L(u)) = N c

T (L(u), u) ≤ (cid:107)∇L(u)(cid:107)Γ∩T(cid:107)u(cid:107)Γ∩T ≤ c

and hence we have (B) and (C) with constants depending on ctr. We see that the
constant from the trace inverse estimate is still very important and enters the error
analysis. However, we do not need to estimate the constant ctr explicitly and hence get
rid of the penalty parameter λ and the “suﬃciently large” condition.

4.2 The modiﬁed formulation for the unﬁtted interface problem

The idea from the previous section can be carried over to unﬁtted interface problems. For
this case the idea has already been introduced in [22, Section 2.2.3.2]. We deﬁne a lifting
operator similar to (6), but use the space of piecewise polynomials which are orthogonal
to constants on each sub-element, P k
0 (Ti), i = 1, 2}. On
cut elements we set

0 (T1,2) := {v ∈ L2(T ), v|T1 ∈ P k

LT : H 1(T1 ∪ T2) → P k

0 (T1,2), s.t.

(9)
on uncut elements we set LT (·) = 0. Overall we again have a(L(u), v) = N c(u, v) ∀v ∈ Vh.
With this property Lemma 2, Corollary 3 and (8) can directly be carried over and we
have (A), (B) and (C). For (D) we note that L(u) = 0 if [[u]] = 0.

0 (T1,2),

aT (LT (u), v) = N c

T (v, u) ∀v ∈ P k

5 Implementational aspects
In this section we want to explain that the implementation of the bilinear form 2a(L(·),L(·))
is fairly simple. We explain the procedure for the case of the ﬁtted Poisson problem. It
however easily translates to the unﬁtted interface problems (or similar problems). To
implement the element-local lifting wh = LT (uh) of a local ﬁnite element function uh and
an element T that is located at the boundary, we solve for wh with uh, wh ∈ P k(T ), such
that

∀vh ∈ P k(T )

(10)

aT (wh, vh) + kT (wh, vh) = N c

T (vh, uh),

with the bilinear form

kT (wh, vh) := h−(d+2) (wh, 1)T (vh, 1)T

which is taylored to eliminate the kernel {uh|T = const}. By testing with a constant
function one easily sees that if wh solves (10), we have kT (wh, vh) = 0 for all vh ∈ P k
0 (T ).
Instead of adding kT (·,·) any other approach which makes (10) uniquely solvable and
T (vh, uh) for all vh ∈ P k(T ) is possible. Note that the local element
ensures aT (wh, vh) = N c
matrices A and Nc corresponding to the bilinear form aT (·,·) and N c
T (·,·) have to be
computed anyway. The only new component, the rank 1 element matrix K corresponding
to kT (·,·) is easily obtained by scaling of a corresponding element matrix with respect
to a reference element. We thus get the coeﬃcients w of the local lifting (wi = L(ϕi))
as w = L · u with L = (A + K)−1NT
c . The overall element contribution to the bilinear
form A∗(·,·) in matrix notation is

A + Nc + NT

c + 2 · LT AL + Ns,1

1 (·,·). The element matrix corre-
where Ns,1 is the element matrix corresponding to N s
sponding to the original formulation, cf. Section 3.1, takes the form A + Nc + NT
c + λNs,1.
We note that the only additional eﬀort of the new formulation is in the computation of
the local matrices K, L and 2 · LT AL.

6 Numerical example

We consider a simple numerical example to compare the original and the modiﬁed method.
The impact of a penalty parameter that has been chosen too large is small for the ﬁtted
case as diagonal preconditioning gives robustness of the linear system with respect to λ. As
this is not true for the unﬁtted interface problem, cf. [18], we consider the discretization of
an unﬁtted interface problem and take an example from [21, Section 4.1]. On the domain
Ω = [2.01, 2.01]2 we consider the interface Γ = {(cid:107)x(cid:107)4 = 1} which is approximated with a
piecewise planar reconstruction Γh. We choose the diﬀusion coeﬃcients (α1, α2) = (1, 2)
so that the solution has a kink across Γ. For the approximation of the solution we
consider the ﬁnite element formulation as in Section 3.2 with k = 1, i.e. piecewise linear
functions and the modiﬁed formulation as in Section 4.2. The right hand side and the
Dirichlet data are chosen such that the solution is given as

(cid:26) 1 + π

We consider a uniform triangular grid obtained by dividing a rectangular 16 × 16 mesh
into triangles which results in 512 unknowns. Note that this implies a very shape regular
mesh. We computed the spectral condition number κ of the diagonally preconditioned
system matrix for diﬀerent values of λ. The results are shown in Table 1. We observe

parameter λ.

Table 1: Dependency of the conditioning of the Nitsche formulation on the penalty
that the standard discretization with N s(·,·) = N s
λ(·,·) is only stable for values λ > 8.
Within a range of one order of magnitude the condition number seems to be essentially
independent of λ. However, for λ ≥ 256 the condition number increases linearly with
1 (·,·) we
λ. For the modiﬁed (parameter-free) formulation with N s(·,·) = N nn(·,·) + N s
obtain a condition number of 86.9, i.e. a condition number which is close to an optimal
choice of λ.
Independent of λ (for λ ≥ 16) we further observed optimal order of convergence for
the L2(Ω) and the H 1(Ω1 ∪ Ω2) norm of the error. This holds also true for the modiﬁed
formulation. Further, we observed that the error seems to be essentially independent
of the choice of λ. This does not hold for the L2(Γ) norm of the jump which decreases
linearly with increasing λ.

7 Conclusion

We presented an approach to eliminate the penalty parameter from symmetric Nitsche
formulations. Modiﬁed Nitsche formulations have been proposed which are based on
well-known formulations from the literature. The new formulations inherit the good
properties while the stability of the formulations no longer depends on a stabilization
parameter that has to be chosen suﬃciently large. We explained the procedure for two
important applications of Nitsche’s method and demonstrated its potential on a simple
numerical example.
