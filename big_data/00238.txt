Abstract

We demonstrate that SDYM equations for the Lie algebra of one-
dimensional vector ﬁelds represent a natural reduction in the frame-
work of general linearly degenerate dispersionless hierarchy. We deﬁne
the reduction in terms of wave functions, introduce generating relation,
Lax-Sato equations and the dressing scheme for the reduced hierarchy.
Multidimensional case is also discussed.

Introduction

This work is connected with the class of equations containing quasiclassical
self-dual Yang-Mills equations. Let us consider a Lax pair

L = ∂t1 − λ∂y1 + A1,
M = ∂t2 − λ∂y2 + A2,

(1)

where A1, A2 belong to some Lie algebra, λ is a complex variable (spectral
parameter). Commutativity condition for operators (1) implies the existence
of potential F , A1 = ∂y1 F , A2 = ∂y2F , satisfying the equation

∂t1 ∂y2 F − ∂t2 ∂y1 F − [∂y1 F, ∂y2 F ] = 0.

For the case of matrix Lie algebra this is a well-known (complexiﬁed) self-
dual Yang-Mills equation (see, e.g., [1], [2]). For the case of Lie algebra of
i=1 vi∂xi, equation (2) represents (N + 4)-dimensional
‘quasiclassical’ self-dual Yang-Mills equations for the coeﬃcients of vector
ﬁeld F (see [3], [4])

vector ﬁelds, F =PN

∂t1 ∂y2 vi − ∂t2 ∂y1 vi −

NXj=1

(∂y2 vj)∂xj ∂y1 vi = 0,

(3)

where 1 6 i 6 N , which for two-dimensional Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds
reduces to six-dimensional heavenly equation [3].

In this work we will consider mainly one-dimensional vector ﬁelds, F =

v∂x, then linear equations corresponding to Lax pair (1) are

∂t1Ψ = (λ∂y1 − (∂y1 v)∂x)Ψ,
∂t2Ψ = (λ∂y2 − (∂y2 v)∂x)Ψ,

(4)

and compatibility conditions (3) take the form of one ﬁve-dimensional equa-
tion

∂t1 ∂y2 v − ∂t2 ∂y1 v − (∂y1 v)(∂x∂y2 v) + (∂y2 v)(∂x∂y1v) = 0.

(5)

Performing dimensional reduction ∂y1 = ∂x, ∂t1 = ∂y2(= ∂y) (respectively,
considering Ψ = Ψ(λ, x + y1, t1 + y2, t2 = t)), we come to linear equations

∂yΨ = (λ∂x − vx∂x)Ψ,
∂tΨ = (λ∂y − vy∂x)Ψ

corresponding to (2+1)-dimensional equation [5]

vtx = vyy + vxvxy − vyvxx,

(6)

(7)

which is a simple representative of a class of linearly degenerate (or weakly
nonlinear) dispersionless integrable equations (see [6], [7], [8])), connected
with the so-called universal hierarchy of Shabat and Martinez Alonso [9]. A
more general geometric setting for the reduction of Diﬀ(S1) SDYM equations
to equation (7) was presented in [10].

Our main purpose is a description of the hierarchy connected with equa-
tions (4) and its generalizations in the framework of general multidimen-
sional dispersionless hierarchy, using the technique developed in [11], [12],
[13]. We will demonstrate that hierarchies of this type represent a rather

2

natural reduction of generic linearly degenerate dispersionless case. We will
also discuss an immersion of ‘universal’ hierarchy of Shabat and Martinez
Alonso [9] to multidimensional hierarchies connected with equations of the
type (4), (5).

A natural language to consider multiple commuting ﬂows or the whole
hierarchy for equations connected with commuting vector ﬁelds is a language
of distributions. A distribution ∆ is an K-dimensional subbundle of the
tangent bundle of smooth N -dimensional manifold, possessing a basis of K
smooth vector ﬁelds V1, . . . VK. Taking local coordinates x1, . . . , xN , we can
. A distribution ∆ is called
involutive if [∆, ∆] ⊂ ∆ (in the sense of commutation of vector ﬁelds).
According to Frobenius theorem for vector ﬁelds, for the case of involutive
distributions a system of partial diﬀerential equations

write the basis as Vi = PN

k=1 vk

i ∂k, ∂k = ∂

(8)

locally admits M = N −K (we will call M a codimension of the distribution)
independent solutions f1, . . . , fM . After some renotation of variables, the
basic vector ﬁelds can always be chosen in a form

Vi =

∂
∂ti

−

MXk=1

vk
i ∂k,

1 6 i 6 K

(9)

where local variables are now t1, . . . , tK, x1, . . . , xM . For the involutive (inte-
grable) case the basic vectors Vi commute, each subset of basic vectors gives
a subdistribution with the same codimension (in remaining variables), and
the Jacobian of functions f1, . . . , fM over variables x1, . . . , xM is not equal
to zero. The distribution is tangent to the level surfaces of the functions
f1, . . . , fM and is uniquely deﬁned by these functions.

The basis of the form (9) is a good starting point to consider the system of
commuting ﬂows, where the variables t1, . . . , tK are ‘times’ of the ﬂows. One
more ingredient we need to consider dispersionless integrable equations is
holomorphicity. We suggest that coeﬃcients of the basis vk
i depend holomor-
pically on the spectral variable λ. In the present work, we consider mostly
the simplest case of polynomial coeﬃcients. Then commutativity (or, more
generally, involutivity) of vector ﬁelds provides equations for the coeﬃcients
of polynomials. Solutions of equations (8) f1, . . . , fM depend in this case on
the spectral parameter, and we call them wave fuctions (using the terminol-
ogy common in the theory of integrable equations). A general wave func-
tion is given by the expression Ψ(λ, x) = F (λ, f1(λ, x), . . . , fM (λ, x)), and

3

the transformation between two sets of basic wave functions is deﬁned by M
functions of M +1 variables. This transformation deﬁnes functional freedom
in the Riemann-Hilbert problem (see below) and indicates that (maximal)
dimensionality of integrable equations corresponding to the distribution of
codimension M is M + 2.

Let us consider linear equations (6) from this viewpoint. These equa-
tions correspond to basic vectors of two-dimensional distribution in three-
dimensional space of variables x, y, t. Involutivity is provided by equation
(7), and, according to Frobenius theorem, equations (6) admit one indepen-
dent solution (wave function) Ψ(λ, x, y, t), and a general solution is given
locally by the function F (Ψ, λ). The function Ψ can be found in the form
of series in λ,

Ψ = Ψ0 +eΨ,

Ψ0 = λ2t + λy + x,

Ψn(x, y, t)λ−n,

(10)

∞Xn=1

eΨ =

where the coeﬃcients Ψn(x, y, t) are deﬁned recursively through linear equa-
tions (6). Linear equations (6) can be also rewritten in the form correspond-
ing to standard basis structure (9),

∂yΨ = (λ∂x − vx∂x)Ψ,
∂tΨ = (λ2∂x − λvx∂x − vy∂x)Ψ,

which can be extended to the inﬁnite hierachy of the form

∂tn Ψ = (λn − Pn−1)∂xΨ,

1 6 n < ∞,

(11)

where Pn−1 are polynomials in λ of the order n − 1 with the coeﬃcients
depending on x and times. Solution (10) retains its structure, with Ψ0
generalized to the inﬁnite set of times,

Ψ = Ψ0 +eΨ, Ψ0 =

λktk,

∞Xk=0

eΨ =

Ψn(t)λ−n,

(12)

∞Xn=1

and x = t0, y = t1, t = t2. Codimension of correspondinq distribution is
1 for any restriction to the ﬁnite set of times, basic vectors for the case of
involutive distribution are commuting and commutation condition for any
pair of them gives a closed (2+1)-dimensional system for the coeﬃcients of
corresponding polynomials. The hierarchy can be also written in recursive
form, which continues the basic set of the form (6),

∂tn Ψ = (λ∂tn−1 − vtn−1 ∂x)Ψ,

1 6 n < ∞, x = t0.

(13)

This hierarchy is a simplest example of linearly-degenerate dispersionless
hierarchy, it corresponds to the so-called universal hierarchy of Shabat and
Martinez Alonso [9] for positive times. The picture of the hierarchy can be
developed starting from the wave function in the form of series (12) and
formulating the dynamics in terms of the series, or, equivalently, in terms of
hydrodynamic type chains [5].

Let us proceed now to the initial SDYM equation for the Lie algebra of
one-dimensional vector ﬁelds (ﬁve-dimensional quasiclassical SDYM equa-
tion) (4), (5). Codimension of the distribution is three, and equations (4)
should have three independent solutions. One of these solutions is of the
form (10),

Ψ = x +

∞Xn=1

Ψn(t)λ−n,

(14)

and two others are trivial,

Ψ1 = λt1 + y1, Ψ2 = λt2 + y2.

In [12], [13] we developed a picture of general multidimensional dispersion-
less hierarchy corresponding to N wave functions of the form (12) with N
inﬁnite sets of times. From this viewpoint, equation (5) is connected with
a special reduction of general linearly degenerate 5-dimensional dispersion-
less hierarchy, characterised by the condition Ψ1 = Ψ1
0. Thus
two of the wave functions are analytic (polynomial for ﬁnite set of vari-
ables). In terms of initial Lax pair (1) the general case corresponds to the
presence of generic terms with derivatives ∂y1, ∂y2 in both vector ﬁelds A1,
A2 (and then in F ), that corresponds to canonical structure of general ba-
sis for the distribution (9). In the reduced case some of the coeﬃcients of
vector ﬁelds are equal to zero, and reduction is characterised by the pres-
ence of analytic (polynomial) wave functions. The functional freedom in
the Riemann-Hilbert problem for the reduced case is one function of four
variables (see below), that corresponds to the fact that the reduction is not
dimensional, and the reduced systems preserves the dimensionality ﬁve.

0, Ψ2 = Ψ2

There exists an interesting direct immersion of (2+1)-dimensional hi-
erarchy (11), (13) to the ﬁve-dimensional system (5), (4).
Indeed, let us
consider a pair of linear equations (13) corresponding to two distinct pairs
of times tn, tn−1 and tk, tk−1,

∂tnΨ = (λ∂tn−1 − vtn−1 ∂x)Ψ,
∂tk Ψ = (λ∂tk−1 − vtk−1 ∂x)Ψ

5

This system exactly corresponds to linear system (4). Thus, having a depen-
dence of solution of the (2+1)-dimensional hierarchy (11) on two arbitrary
distinct pairs of higher times, we get a special solution to ﬁve-dimensional
equation (5). Thus equation (5) plays a role of ’intertwiner’ for higher ﬂows
of the hierarchy associated with the distribution (11), (13). A similar phe-
nomenon is known for the case of SDYM hierarchy [1].

1.1 Towards general multidimensional case

Let us consider ﬁrst a simple characteristic example which demonstrates
some distinctive features of quasiclassic SDYM case, connected with the
fact that corresponding distributions are rather special, starting from three-
dimensional distribution with the basic equations

∂t1Ψ = (λ∂y1 − vy1 ∂x)Ψ,
∂t2Ψ = (λ∂y2 − vy2 ∂x)Ψ,
∂t3Ψ = (λ∂y3 − vy3 ∂x)Ψ.

(15)

Codimension of this distribution is 4, and we expect integrable systems of
(maximal) dimension 6. However, taking compatibility condition for any
pair of equations (15), we get equations of dimension 5. This phenomenon
is connected with presence of polynomial solutions Ψ1 = λt1 + y1, Ψ2 =
λt2 + y2, Ψ3 = λt3 + y3 (the fourth function of the basic set is generic,
of the form (14)). Lax pair for some integrable equation is obtained from
the distribution (containing several commuting ﬂows) by restriction to some
subset of variables (or, more generally, by restriction to some submanifold)
to obtain two-dimensional distribution, which is especially simple for the
basis of the form (9). For the case of generic wave functions, the number
of wave functions and respectively the codimension of the distribution is
preserved, and we get R + 2-dimensional equations. However, if there exist
special wave functions independent on some of the variables (like in the
present example), they may drop out in the process of restriction of the set
of variables, then the codimension of the distribution and respectively the
dimensionality of the system will be less then maximal.

One of the ways to get 5-dimensional system in this case is a restriction of
the set of variables. Let us consider a restriction to submanifold x = const.
The distribution in this case is two-dimensional and consists of the vectors,
not containing ∂x, the basis can be obtained from (15), taking appropriate
linear combinations. In terms of the basic equations, we can express ∂xΨ

6

from the ﬁrst equation in (15),

∂xΨ = −

1
vy1

(∂t1 − λ∂y1)Ψ.

Substituting this expression into third and and second equations of the sys-
tem (15), we obtain

(∂t2 − λ∂y2)Ψ =

(∂t3 − λ∂y3)Ψ =

vy2
vy1
vy3
vy1

(∂t1 − λ∂y1)Ψ,

(∂t1 − λ∂y1)Ψ,

(16)

the compatibility condition for this system (the commutativity of the basic
vectors of the distribution) gives a quasilinear equations of second order,

vy3(vy2t1 − vy1t2) + vy1(vy3t2 − vy2t3) + vy2(vy1t3 − vy3t1) = 0.

(17)

Remark. This six-dimensional quasilinear equation of the second order is
connected with the two-component ﬁrst order quasilinear system [14]

f gy1 − gfy1 + fy3 − gy2 = 0,
gft1 − f gt1 + gt2 − ft3 = 0,

associated with a Lax pair

(∂t2 − λ∂y2)Ψ = f (∂t1 − λ∂y1)Ψ,
(∂t3 − λ∂y3)Ψ = g(∂t1 − λ∂y1)Ψ,

linear system (16) and equation (17) are obtained by the substitution [15]

f =

vy2
vy1

,

g =

vy3
vy1

.

Another way is to make a restriction to a slightly more involved sub-
manifold, the advantage of this way is that it can be easily generalized to an
arbitrary number of the basic equations of the form (15). Let us consider
a restriction of the distribution (15) to submanifold y2 = t3 = τ . Then we
get 2-dimensional distribution in the space of 6 variables t1, y1, t2, τ , y3, x
with a basis

∂t1Ψ = (λ∂y1 − (∂y1 v)∂x)Ψ,
∂t2Ψ = (−λ2∂y3 + λ∂τ + (λ(∂y3 v) + u)∂x)Ψ,

(18)

7

and a compatibility condition gives a six-dimensional system of equations
for two functions u, v,

uy1 − vy3t1 − vy1τ + vy1 vy3x − vy1xvy3 = 0,
vy1t2 − ut1 + vxy1u − vy1 ux = 0.

The considered example gives us some insight into the structure of gen-
eral multidimensional quasiclassical SDYM hierarchy for the Lie algebra of
one-dimensional vector ﬁelds. We will now give a sketch of general picture,
which will be developed in more detail below.

For the case of (M + 2)-dimensional hierarchy, M > 3, corresponding
to distribution of codimension M (and, respectively, equations of maximal
dimensionality M + 2) we have M − 1 inﬁnite series of variables tk
n, 1 6 k 6
M − 1, 1 6 n < ∞ and a variable x (one-dimensional vector ﬁeld variable).
The hierarchy is deﬁned by linear equations

corresponding to the basic vectors of the distribution in recursive form.
Equations (19) have M − 1 analytic (polynomial for ﬁnite number of times)
solutions

and one solution of the form (14),

Ψ = x +

Ψn(t, x)λ−n.

Ψk =

∞Xn=1

To obtain equations of maximal dimensionality M + 2 in the framework
of this hierarchy, it is possible to apply the scheme of restriction to the
submanifold used to derive system (18), which is easily generalized to the
multidimensional case. The structure of the Lax pair in this case is

∂t1 Ψ = (λ∂y1 − (∂y1 v)∂x)Ψ,

∂t2 Ψ = M −2Xn=1

λn∂τn + PM −3∂x! Ψ,

(20)

where we have M + 2 variables t1, y1, t2, τk, 1 6 k 6 M − 2, x, and PM −3 is
a polynomial in λ of the order M − 3. Compatibility of this equations gives
(M + 2)-dimensional closed system for v and coeﬃcients of the polynomial
PM −3.

2 Quasiclassical SDYM type hierarchies as a re-

duction of general multidimensional case

In this section we will demonstrate that quasiclassical SDYM type hierar-
chies represent a simple and natural reduction of general linearly degenerate
multidimensional dispersionless hierarchy. We deﬁne this reduction in terms
of wave functions of polynomial distribution describing the hierarchy. We
will introduce generating relations and the dressing scheme for the reduced
hierarchy. The functional freedom in the reduced dressing scheme (number
of variables of the functions deﬁning the dressing data) doesn’t change in the
process of reduction, indicating that multidimensional universal hierarchy is
of the same dimensionality as initial general case.

2.1 Polynomial linearly degenerate multidimensional disper-

sionless hierarchy

Equations of the class we consider here are usually represented as com-
mutation relations for a pair of vector ﬁelds (Lax pair) with coeﬃcients
holomorphic with respect to the spectral variable, they are usually called
dispersionless (or quasilinear) integrable equations. In general, vector ﬁelds
contain a derivative over spectral variable (e.g., dispersionless KP equation).
A picture of general multidimensional dispersionless integral hierarchy, start-
ing from the properties of the wave functions, generating relation in terms
of diﬀerential N -form and Lax-Sato equations, was developed in [12], [13]

In this work we consider Lax pairs with a spectral variable entering
vector ﬁelds only as a parameter (there is no derivative over spectral variable
in vector ﬁelds). We will use the term linearly degenerate for this case.
Sometimes it is called weakly nonlinear, in twistor theory the term hyper-
CR case is also used. Typical representatives of this class are Pleban´ski
heavenly equations and equation (7).

First, we will outline the picture of linearly degenerate dispersionless
hierarchy, using the description given in [13] for the general dispersionless
hierarchy, starting from wave functions and generating diﬀerential M -form.
The involutive distribution of vector ﬁelds of codimension M can be

deﬁned through the diﬀerential form [16], [17]

ΩM = dΨ1 ∧ dΨ2 ∧ . . . dΨM ,

where the functions Ψi are level functions for integral surfaces of the distri-
bution, i.e., integral surfaces are given by intersection of level surfaces for

9

these functions. These functions are annulated by vector ﬁelds considered
as diﬀerential operators, and thus they are solutions of linear equations of
the hierarchy (‘wave functions’). For the general hierarchy [13] the functions
Ψi depend on the set of times t and a spectral parameter λ, diﬀerentials do
not contain dλ, and level functions (wave functions) are formal series in λ

The hierarchy is generated by the relation

(cid:0)J −1dΨ1 ∧ dΨ2 ∧ . . . dΨM(cid:1)− = 0

(22)

where (· · ·)− denotes the projection to the part of (· · ·) with negative powers
in λ (respectively (· · ·)+ projects to nonnegative powers) and J = det(∂jΨi)i,j=1,...,M .
Reduction J = 1 corresponds to volume-preserving (divergence-free vector
ﬁelds) case. Relation (22) implies Lax-Sato equations deﬁning the dynamics
of wave functions over higher times, moreover, it is equivalent to the set of
Lax-Sato equations [13].

Generating relation represents a polynomiality condition for the coeﬃ-

cients of the form

eΩM = J −1dΨ1 ∧ dΨ2 ∧ . . . dΨM ,

leading to the polynomiality of integrable distribution corresponding to this
form. This condition can be provided using Riemann-Hilbert problem (see
below).

To construct polynomial vector ﬁelds belonging to the integrable distri-
bution corresponding to relation (22), it is convenient to use the following
observation [12]:
Proposition 1. For arbitrary vector ﬁeld ˆV in the space of variables t with
coeﬃcients polynomial in λ and Ψ = (Ψ1, . . . , ΨM ), where functions Ψi of
the form (21) satisfy generating relation (22),

( ˆV Ψ)+ = 0 =⇒ ˆV Ψ = 0.

This observation gives an opportunity to construct polynomial vector
ﬁelds belonging to the integrable distribution (linear operators of the hier-
archy) in the spirit of Manakov ring technique [18], controlling only ‘singular’

10

part of the result of action of the operator on wave function (here it is a mul-
ticomponent function). First, we can introduce a basic set of vector ﬁelds
ˆV i
n = λn∂i, where ∂i = ∂
, Then for arbitrary derivative over higher time
∂xi
n = ∂

Introducing the Jacobian matrix

it is possible to write the hierarchy in the Lax-Sato form

(compare to (3)), reﬂecting the fact that our generic (M+2)-dimensional
hierarchy can be naturally immersed into a special (M+4)-dimensional hi-
erarchy (see below).

The dressing scheme

It is easy to see that ˜ΩM is invariant under diﬀeomorphism

(Ψ1, . . . , ΨM ) → F(λ, Ψ1, . . . , ΨM )

Let us consider functions Ψk holomorphic inside and outside the unit circle
(we denote components Ψk
out correspond to the series intro-
duced above), having a discontinuity on it. If they satisfy a nonlinear vector
Riemann-Hilbert problem (nvRHp)

in and Ψk

out, Ψk

(Ψ1, . . . , ΨM )in = F(λ, Ψ1, . . . , ΨM )out,

(26)

then the form ˜ΩM is holomorhic in all the complex plane.

Thus nvRHp gives a tool to construct forms ˜ΩM , generating integrable
distributions with holomorphic (meromorhic) coeﬃcients and solutions to
corresponding involution equations. See [11], [12], [13] for more detail, non-
linear vector ¯∂ problem can be also used in the dressing scheme.

2.2 Description of the class of reductions

In this work we consider a class of reductions of general hierarchy (22), (23)
characterised by the condition that M − P , 1 6 P < M , of the series Ψk
nλn (for ﬁnite subsets of times
are equal to ‘vacuum’ functions Ψk
they are polynomial)

Generating relation (22) for the reduced hierarchy takes the form

where the Jacobian is eﬀectively taken for the set of functions Ψ1, . . . , ΨP .
Lax-Sato equations (23) have rather special structure in this case, taking
into account that the only nonzero entries of last M −P lines of the Jacobian
form the unity matrix.

Reduction (27) is characterized rather simply in terms of the dressing
scheme (26). The dressing data for this scheme are represented by the
diﬀeomorphism F. Let us take a diﬀeomorphism that gives an identical
transformation for last M − P components,

F k(λ, Ψ1, . . . , ΨM ) = Ψk, P < k 6 M.

Then the functions Ψk, P < k 6 M , don’t have a discontinuity on the unit
circle and are analytic in the complex plane, thus leading us to reduction
(27). The Riemann-Hilbert problem is then written for the ﬁrst P functions
Ψk,

Ψq

in = F q(λ, Ψ1, . . . , ΨP , ΨP +1

0

, . . . , ΨM

0 )out,

1 6 q 6 P

The functional freedom of the dressing data is p functions of M +1 variables,
that indicates that reduced equations are generically M +2-dimensional, like
equations of unreduced hierarchy.

However, if we consider the hierarchy with complete initially introduced
set of times t1, . . . , tM, we discover that the hierarchy contains subhierar-
chies with diﬀerent dimensionalities (diﬀerent number of independent vari-
ables in corresponding equations). Geometrically this is due to the fact that
some of the level functions Ψi deﬁning integral surfaces for vector ﬁelds are
rather special and depend only on some subset of the variables of the hier-
archy (level functions Ψi = Ψi
0). Thus, we can choose some subsets of the
variables of the hierarchy (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), for which the eﬀective number of
level functions is less than M , then the codimension of corresponding distri-
bution is less than M , and dimensionality of corresponding equations of the
hierarchy (involutivity equations) is less than M + 2. It would be interesting
to study geometry of distributions for this hierarchy, which is probably de-
scribed locally in terms of some special submanifolds of the Grassmannian
[16]. However, in our examples we will try to choose special subsets of times
to get rid of this degeneracy and obtain M + 2-dimensional equations.

The case M = 4, P = 2 after additional divergence-free reduction leads
to the six-dimensional heavenly equation [3]. For P > 2, M = P + 2 we get
equation considered in [11], [4]. We are planning to discuss these cases in
more detail later.

The multidimensional reduced hierarchies considered in this work cor-
respond to the choice P = 1, i.e., we have one nontrivial function Ψ and
several vacuum functions Ψi
0. Vector ﬁelds in this case are eﬀectively one-
dimensional, and corresponding hierarchies can be considered as multidi-
mensional extensions of Shabat-Mart´ınez Alonso universal hierarchy [9].

2.3 Universal hierarchy

Universal hierarchy of Shabat and Mart´ınez Alonso [9] for ‘positive’ times
is a general hierarchy described in subsection 2.1 for M = 1. In this case we
have one wave function Ψ,

Ψ = Ψ0 +eΨ,

generating equation (22) acquires the form

Ψn(t)λ−n,

∞Xn=1

and Lax-Sato equations are

Ψ0 =

tnλn,

eΨ =

∞Xn=0
(cid:0)Ψ−1
x dΨ(cid:1)− = 0,
∂nΨ =(cid:0)(Ψx)−1λn(cid:1)+

(28)

(29)

∂xΨ,

where x = t0, ∂n = ∂
∂tn

. The ﬁrst two ﬂows

∂yΨ = (λ − vx)∂x,
∂tΨ = (λ2 − vxλ − vy)∂x,

where y = t1, t = t2, v = Ψ1(t), give a Lax pair for (2+1)-dimensional
equation (7),

vxt = vyy + vxvxy − vxxvy,

discussed in the Introduction.

The Riemann-Hilbert problem (26) for the dressing scheme associated

with universal hierarchy looks like

Ψin = F (λ, Ψout).

The properties of solutions and inverse problem for equation (7) were re-
cently studied in [19].

Lax-Sato equations (29) can be represented in recursive form (13),

(∂n − λ∂n−1)Ψ = −(∂n−1v)∂xΨ, n > 1.

(30)

14

2.4 Four-dimensional universal hierarchy

Let us consider a reduction of the four-dimensional hierarchy (Section 2.1,
M = 2) characterised by the condition

Ψ2 = Ψ2
0,

We drop higher times t1
n, n > 1 to get rid of (2+1)-dimensional part of the
hierarchy corresponding to universal hierarchy for these times and consider
two wave functions

Ψ = x +

∞Xn=1

Ψn(t)λ−n, Ψ1 =

tn+1λn,

∞Xn=0

generating relation (22) for this case reads

(Ψ−1

x dΨ ∧

λndtn+1)− = 0.

(31)

∞Xn=0

Lax-Sato equations of reduced hierarchy can be extracted from general Lax-
Sato equations (23) and have a rather special structure

∂n+1Ψ = (λn∂y −(cid:0)(Ψx)−1Ψyλn(cid:1)+

∂x)Ψ,

(32)

where y = t1. They can also be represented in a very simple recursive form,
implied by Prop. 1,

(∂n+1 − λ∂n)Ψ = −(∂nv)∂xΨ, n > 1.

(33)

First two ﬂows in recursive form

(∂t − λ∂y)Ψ = −(vy)∂xΨ
(∂w − λ∂t)Ψ = −(vt)∂xΨ,

where t = t2, w = t3, give a Lax pair for a four-dimensional equation

vwy = vtt + vyvxt − vyxvt.

(34)

Riemann-Hilbert problem for the dressing scheme associated with this case
is

Ψin = F (λ, Ψout,

λntn+1),

(35)

and the dressing data is represented by the function of three variables
F (λ, X, Y ), that corresponds to the functional freedom for Cauchy prob-
lem for equation (34).

Immersion of universal hierarchy into four-dimensional uni-
versal hierarchy

There exists a natural immersion of universal hierarchy into four-dimensional
universal hierarchy. On the level of distributions it manifests itself in the
fact that the basis (30) can be represented as the basis (33) plus one extra
vector (for n = 0). Codimension of distribution (30) is 1, and codimension
of distribution (33) equals 2, respective dimensionality of involutivity equa-
tions (equations of the hierarchy) is 3 and 4. Having solutions of equations
of universal hierarchy depending on some set of higher times, we obtain
solutions of four-dimensional universal hierarchy.

This immersion has also a simple interpretation in terms of generating
equation and dressing scheme. Let us have a solution of generating equation
for universal hierarchy (28),

x dΨ(cid:1)− = 0,
(cid:0)Ψ−1
∞Xn=0
λntn +eΨ,

Ψ =

Ψn(t)λ−n,

∞Xn=1

eΨ =

then the function Ψ′ = x + eΨ satisﬁes generating equation (31) for four-

dimensional universal hierarchy

(Ψ′−1

x dΨ′ ∧

because, evidently,

∞Xn=0

λndtn+1)− = 0,

(Ψ′−1

x dΨ′ ∧

λndtn+1)− = (Ψ−1

x dΨ ∧

λndtn+1)− = 0

∞Xn=0

∞Xn=0

In terms of the dressing scheme the immersion corresponds to some special
choice of the dressing data for the problem (35), namely

F (λ, X, Y ) = G(λ, X + λY ),

which allows to get (special) solutions of four-dimensional universal hierar-
chy from solutions of universal hierarchy.

2.5 Five-dimensional universal hierarchy

Let us take P = 1, M = 3 and consider the series

Ψ = x +

and Lax-Sato equations (23) split into two copies of Lax-Sato equations for
the four-dimensional universal hierarchy (32),

∂1

∂2

n+1Ψ = (λn∂y1 −(cid:0)(Ψx)−1Ψy1λn(cid:1)+

∂x)Ψ,

∂x)Ψ,

1, y2 = t2

where y1 = t1
. Taking ﬁrst two ﬂows of this hierarchy,
we get linear equations (4) and ﬁve-dimensional quasiclassical SDYM equa-
tion (5). Thus, equations (36) represent Lax-Sato equation of the hierarchy
associated with ﬁve-dimensional quasiclassical SDYM equation.

with the dressing data represented by the function of four variables.

2.6 Multidimensional reduced hierarchy

Let us consider multidimensional case P = 1, M > 3, corresponding to M
wave functions (with only P = 1 nontrivial)

and

Ψ = x +

∞Xn=1

Ψn(t, x)λ−n

Ψk =

Hilbert problem

Ψin = F (λ, Ψout,

tM −1
n+1 λn)

∞Xn=0

with the dressing data represented by the function of (M + 1) variables,
that indicates that maximal dimensionality of equations of the hierarchy is
(M + 2).

Each of Lax-Sato equations (37) is three-dimensional. To extract (M +
2)-dimensional equation in the framework of this hierarchy, it is necessary to
perform a restriction to some submanifold of variables to get rid of degener-
acy. The geometric origin of this degeneracy was explained in subsection1.1,
where we have demonstrated how to perform a restriction to submanifold
and obtain 6-dimensional equation for the case M = 4 (15). The scheme
of restriction can be easily generalized to multidimensional case. Let us
consider a system of lowest order Lax-Sato equations (37)

∂tk Ψ = (λ∂yk − (∂yk v)∂x)Ψ,

1 6 k 6 M − 1,

(38)

with the set of variables tk = tk
1, x. Codimension of distribution
(38) is equal to M , which corresponds to the codimension of the hierarchy.
Let us restrict this set of variables to (M + 2)-dimensional submanifold

2, yk = tk

y2 = t3 = τ1,
. . .
yk+1 = tk+2 = (−1)k+1τk,
. . .
yM −2 = tM −1 = (−1)M −2τM −3,
yM −1 = (−1)M −1τM −2

18

with the variables x, t1, t2, y1, τ1, . . . , τM −2. Restriction of the distribution
corresponding to equations (38) to the tangent space for this submanifold
gives a 2-dimensional distribution (Lax pair)

∂t1 Ψ = (λ∂y1 − (∂y1 v)∂x)Ψ,

∂t2 Ψ = M −2Xn=1

λn∂τn + PM −3∂x! Ψ,

where PM −3 is a polynomial in λ of the order M − 3. Compatibility of these
equations (commutativity of vector ﬁelds) gives (M + 2)-dimensional closed
system for v and coeﬃcients of the polynomial PM −3.
