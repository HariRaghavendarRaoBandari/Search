BRENDLE’S INEQUALITY ON STATIC MANIFOLDS

XIAODONG WANG, YE-KAI WANG

ABSTRACT. We generalize Brendle’s geometric inequality considered in [2] to static manifolds.
The inequality bounds the integral of inverse mean curvature of an embedded mean-convex hy-
persurface by geometric data of the horizon. As a consequence, we obtain a reverse Penrose
inequality on static asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds in the spirit of Chru´sciel and
Simon [9].

We say (M n, g, f ) is a static manifold if (M, g) is a complete Riemannian manifold, f is a

1. INTRODUCTION

positive function on M ({f = 0} = ∂M if ∂M 6= φ), and satisﬁes the static equations
(1)
(2)
Here Λ is called the cosmological constant. By normalization, we assume Λ = ǫn with ǫ ∈
{1, 0,−1}.

f Rij − DiDjf + ∆f gij = 0,
∆f = −Λf.

Interests in static manifolds are motivated by general relativity. The (Lorentzian) metric

¯g = −f 2dt2 + g

solves the (Lorentzian) vacuum Einstein equations with cosmological constant Λ on (−∞,∞)×
M. An extensive study has been done on 3-dimensional static manifolds with zero cosmological
constant and asymptotically ﬂat at inﬁnity (see [5, Assumption 1, page 148]). The case of black
hole boundary is completely classiﬁed: (M, g, f ) is isometric to the exterior Schwarzschild
solution [11, 15, 5, 7]. Recently, Cederbaum and Galloway solved the case of photon sphere
boundary [8]. On the other hand, the static n-body problem is far from settled, see [6]. A better
understanding of the behavior of the static potential [10, 13] would be crucial.

In [2], Brendle considers a class of warped product manifolds (M, g) that includes the (anti)

de Sitter-Schwarzschild manifold. Here M = [0, ¯r) × N and
g = dr ⊗ dr + h(r)2gN .

The assumptions Brendle imposes on the warping factor essentially require that f (r) = h′(r)
satisﬁes

and f (0) = 0. Brendle proves a geometric inequality

Applications of this inequality include the classiﬁcation of embedded constant mean curva-
ture hypersurfaces [2] and a sharp Minkowski inequality [4] on (anti) de Sitter-Schwarzschild
manifolds.

M. Eichmair observes that the ﬁrst inequality holds on static manifolds (see the footnote on
page 257 of [2]). The main result in this note is a generalization of the second inequality to the
static manifolds.

Theorem 1.2. Let N be a connected component of ∂M and Σ be an embedded hypersurface
that is homologous to N, so that ∂Ω = Σ ∪ N. Assume that the scalar curvature of N satisﬁes

and Σ has positive mean curvature with respect to the outward normal of Ω. Then

Starting from section 3, we study the implications of (5) on (M, g, f ) with various bound-
ary conditions. When the cosmological constant is negative, a major open problem in general
relativity is to classify all asymptotically hyperbolic (see Section 4 for the deﬁnition) static
manifolds. The only known case is when ∂M = φ, Boucher-Gibbons-Horowitz [3], J. Qing
[14] and the ﬁrst author [16] showed that the hyperbolic space is the only solution.

We observe that the integral

approaches negative ADM mass when Σ approaches inﬁnity. Hence, (5) can be regarded as a
reverse Penrose inequality.

Corollary 1.3. Let (M, g, f ) be an asymptotically locally hyperbolic static manifold with a
connected boundary N. Assume (10) holds on N. Then we have an upper bound for the mass

Chru´sciel and Simon [9] suggest that such inequality can be combined with a Penrose-type
inequality to obtain uniqueness results of static manifolds. We refer to [12] for a realization of
this program when the mass aspect function is nonpositive.

Let us turn to the case of positive cosmological constant. Besides the hemisphere with stan-
dard round metric and f = cos θ, we have the family of de Sitter-Schwarzschild manifolds as
models. It is a warped product with M = [s1, s2] × Sn−1 and

g =

1
f 2 ds2 + s2g0

where f = √1 − s2 − ms2−n and s1, s2 are two positive roots of f. The equator of the hemi-
sphere and {s = s2} in de Sitter-Schwarzschild manifold are called cosmological horizons in
physics literature. The presence of them makes the classiﬁcation problem qualitatively different
from that of zero or negative cosmological constant. We recommend the introduction of [1] for
the current status in dimension 3. Here we only mention the main result in [1]:

Theorem 1.4. [1, Theorem D] Let (M 3, g, f ) be a compact simply connected static manifold
with connected boundary and scalar curvature 6. If
4π

|∂M| ≥

then (M 3, g, f ) is equivalent to the standard hemisphere.

Motivating by de Sitter-Schwarzschild manifolds, we relate the geometric quantity of two

horizons in a static manifold.

Corollary 1.5. Let (M, g, f ) be a static manifold with positive cosmological constant. Suppose
that M is diffeomorphic to N × [s1, s2]. Let N1 = N × {s1} and N2 = N × {s2} be the two
connected components of ∂M. Assume that
RN1 > n(n − 1)

and RN2 < n(n − 1).

Then we have

The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing basic facts on static manifolds (Section
2), we prove Theorem 1.2 in Section 3. As applications to Theorem 1.2, we prove Corollary 1.3
in Section 4 and Corollary 1.5 in Section 5 respectively.

2. GEOMETRY NEAR THE HORIZON

We assume that (M, g, f ) is an n-dimensional static manifold with connected boundary N.

Let D be the Levi-Civita connection of g. The static equations now read

f (Rαβ − nǫgαβ) = DαDβf
∆gf = −nǫf

where ǫ ∈ {1, 0,−1}. Static equations imply that R = ǫn(n−1) and |Df| is a positive constant
κ on N. Moreover, N is totally geodesic.

Deﬁnition 2.1. The constant κ is called the surface gravity of the horizon N.

Let r be the distance function from N. We ﬁx a tubular neighborhood UN of N that is
diffeomorphic to N × [0, r0). Fixing a coordinate system {xi} on N, we henceforth work on
N × [0, r0) with coordinates {r, xi} instead of UN. The expansion of the static potential is given
by

(8)
We can choose r0 sufﬁciently small such that f ≥ 1
sion

f = κr + O(r3).

Let ˜g denote the induced metric of N. Since N is totally geodesic, the metric has the expan-

2κr in N × [0, r0).

where g(2) is a symmetric two-tensor on N. Direct computation shows Rirjr|r=0 = −g(2)

3. BRENDLE’S GEOMETRIC INEQUALITY ON STATIC MANIFOLDS

We closely follow the presentation of [2, Section 3] and omit the arguments that are identical.
The new ingredients are Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.4. Lemma 3.1 is an improvement of Lemma
3.6 in [2]. While Proposition 2.3 in [2] is not available in our case because we only have an
approximate conformal Killing vector ﬁeld X near horizon, we replace it by Lemma 3.4.

We recall some deﬁnitions from [2]. Let Σ be a closed, embedded, orientable, mean-convex
hypersurface that is homologous to N. Let Ω be the domain enclosed by Σ and N. Consider
f 2 g. For each point p ∈ ¯Ω, we denote by u(p) = dˆg(p, Σ) the distance
the Fermat metric ˆg = 1
of p from Σ with respect to the metric ˆg. Let Φ : Σ × [0,∞) → ¯Ω be the normal exponential
map with respect to ˆg. Namely, for each point x ∈ Σ, the curve t 7→ Φ(x, t) is a geodesic with
respect to ˆg with

Φ(x, 0) = x,

= −f (x)ν(x).

Φ(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

A = {(x, t) ∈ Σ × [0,∞) : u(Φ(x, t)) = t}

A∗ = {(x, t) ∈ Σ × [0,∞) : (x, t + δ) ∈ A for some δ > 0}.

Lemma 3.1. For any 0 < σ < 1, there exist a number τ1 > 0 with the following property: if p
is a point in {u ≥ τ1} and α is a unit-speed geodesic with respect to ˆg such that α(0) = p and
α(u(p)) ∈ Σ, then |α′(0)| = f (p) and
(cid:28) ∂

, α′(0)(cid:29) ≥ f (p) − cf (p)3−σ,

where c is a constant independent of u(p).

Moreover, we have

uj → u in C∞loc(W ), where W = Φ(A∗ ∩ (Σ × (τ − 1, τ + 1))).

4. A REVERSE PENSORE INEQUALITY ON ASYMPTOTICALLY LOCALLY HYPERBOLIC

STATIC MANIFOLDS

Recall that we assume that M has connected boundary. In this section, we further assume

that (M, g) is asymptotically hyperbolic.

Deﬁnition 4.1. (M, g) is conformally compact if there exists a Riemannian manifold ( ¯M, ¯g)
such that

(1) ¯M = M ∪ ∂∞M,
(2) there exists a deﬁning function ρ ∈ C∞( ¯M) for ∂∞M. Namely, ρ−1(0) = ∂∞M and
dρ 6= 0 on ∂∞M.
(3) ¯g = ρ2g is a smooth metric on ¯M .
It is well-known that ¯g induces a well-deﬁned conformal class on ∂∞M.

Deﬁnition 4.2. A static manifold (M, g, f ) is asymptotically locally hyperbolic if

(1) (M, g) is conformally compact,
(2) There is an Einstein metric g0 in the conformal class [¯g|∂∞M ]. We normalize g0 such
that Ric(g0) = (n − 2)kg0 with k ∈ {−1, 0, 1}
(3) f−1 is a deﬁning function and f−2g|∂∞M = g0.

We say (M, g, f ) is asymptotically hyperbolic if the conformal boundary (∂∞M, [¯g|∂∞M ]) is
conformal to (Sn−1, [g0]) where g0 is the standard metric on Sn−1.

We remark that if (M, g) is conformally compact, the sectional curvature approaches −1 at
inﬁnity. Therefore, an asymptotically hyperbolic static manifold must have negative cosmolog-
ical constant.
Example 4.3. [12, Deﬁnition 1.2] Let (N, g0) be an (n − 1)-dimensional Einstein manifold
with Ric(g0) = (n − 2)kg0. Let m ∈ R be large enough so that the function

has a positive zero. Let sm be the largest zero of V 2, and deﬁne the metric

s2 + k − 2ms2−n =: V (r)2

1

k + s2 − 2ms2−n ds2 + s2g0

deﬁned on (sm,∞) × N. Let (M, g) be the metric completion of this Riemannian manifold.
(M, g, V ) is a 1-parameter family of asymptotically locally hyperbolic static manifolds. We say
that (M, g, V ) is a Kottler space with conformal inﬁnity (N, g0) and mass m.

. It is easy to see that the Kottler space with zero mass is conformally ﬂat

One implication of (23) is a reverse Penrose inequality on asymptotically locally hyperbolic

static manifold.

Corollary 4.4 (Corollary 1.3). Let (M, g, f ) be an asymptotically locally hyperbolic static man-
ifold with a connected boundary N. Assume (10) holds on N. Then we have an upper bound
for the mass of (M, g):

reads

Corollary 5.1 (Corollary 1.5). Let (M, g, f ) be a static manifold with positive cosmological
constant. Suppose that M is diffeomorphic to N × [s1, s2]. Let N1 = N × {s1} and N2 =
N × {s2} be the two connected components of ∂M. Assume that

Then we have

Proof. Let r be the distance function from N2 and Σr be the level sets of r. Since RN2 <
n(n − 1), Σr has positive mean curvature with respect to − ∂
∂r when r is sufﬁciently small.
Since ∆gf = −nf, the divergence theorem implies
