Abstract: We present a detailed study of the Entanglement Entropy (EE) of excited
states in all closed rank one subsectors of N = 4 SYM, namely SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2).
Exploiting the techniques of the Coordinate and the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz we obtain the
EE for spin chains with up to seven magnons, at leading order in the coupling expansion
but exact in the length of the spin chain and of the part of it that we cut. Focusing on the
superconformal primary operator with two magnons in the BMN limit, we derive analytic
and exact, in the coupling λ(cid:48), expressions for the Renyi and the EE. The interpolating
functions for the Renyi and the EE monotonically increase as the coupling increases from
the weak coupling λ(cid:48) → 0 regime to the strong coupling λ(cid:48) → ∞ regime. This results to a
violation of a certain bound for the EE that is present at weak coupling and conﬁrms the
physical intuition that entanglement increases when the coupling increases.

1 Introduction

One of the most intriguing features of a quantum system is that of entanglement. When
a physical system is in an entangled state local measurements at one point may instan-
taneously aﬀect the result of local measurements at distant points. A universal measure
of entanglement is the Entanglement Entropy (EE). It can be deﬁned for any quantum
ﬁeld theory or many-body system and unlike correlation functions is a non-local quantity.
Suppose we are given a quantum system, e.g. a quantum ﬁeld theory in d + 1 dimensions.
Furthermore, suppose that we split the system in two parts, D and its complementary DC.
Assuming that the full Hilbert space of the theory H can be written as the direct product
of the Hilbert spaces of the parts D and DC, namely H = HD ⊗ HDC , one can deﬁne the
reduced density matrix (RDM) of region D in the following way
ρD = T rDC ρ , where ρ = |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ,

(1.1)
if the system is in a pure quantum state |ψ(cid:105). Then the EE is deﬁned as the von Neumann
entropy of the reduced density matrix, which as can be seen from (1.1) is obtained when
we trace out the degrees of freedom of the complementary region DC

SEE(D) = − Tr(cid:2)ρD log ρD

(cid:3) .

(1.2)

Physically, the EE indicates to what extend the two subsystems, D and DC, are correlated.
Equivalently, one can also interpret the EE as the entropy measured by an observer sitting
in the region D who has no access to information about the subsystem DC.

Furthermore, since the EE is deﬁned as the von Neumann entropy one should expect
that it is, somehow, related to the degrees of freedom of the system under consideration.
This expectation is fully realised in the context of two dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories
(2d CFTs) where the universal piece of the EE is proportional to the central charge [1, 2].
Indeed, for a one-dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions at the critical
point, the EE for an interval of length l is given by

where c is the central charge of the corresponding CFT, a is a UV cuf–oﬀ and L is the length
of the whole system. Based on the holographic proposal of Ryu & Takayanagi (RT) [3, 4]
for the EE of a higher dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory, it seems that the proportionality
between the EE and the central charge of a CFT in four dimensions also holds. The
holographic proposal for calculating the EE has been proved for spherical entangling regions
[5] and there are supporting arguments based on the notion of generalised entropy [6].

As opposed to the thermal entropy, the EE is non-vanishing at zero temperature.
Therefore, we can employ it to probe the quantum properties of the ground state for a
given quantum system. Additionally it can be used as an order parameter for the study of
quantum phase transitions at zero temperature [7, 8].

The vast majority of the results obtained so far in the literature have been devoted to
the entanglement properties of the vacuum state. Comparatively, very little is known about
the behaviour of the EE when the system under consideration is in an excited state (see for
example [9])1. The aim of this work is to contribute towards this direction. In particular,
we will focus our attention at one of the mostly studied conformal ﬁeld theories, namely the
maximally supersymmetric ﬁeld theory in four dimensions N = 4 SYM. It is well-known
that the operators of N = 4 SYM can be mapped to states of an integrable spin-chain,
while the dilatation operator can be mapped to a long-range spin-chain Hamiltonian whose
eigenvalues give the spectrum of the dilatation operator [11]. Furthermore, through the
AdS/CFT correspondence [12] (for a set of pedagogical introductions see [13, 14]) the gauge
theory operators are dual to certain string states propagating on the AdS5×S5 background
with the energies of the string states being equal to the dimension of the dual ﬁeld theory
operator.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we will analytically calculate the
EE of excited states with two magnons in all closed rank one subsectors of N = 4 SYM,
namely SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2). Our calculation will be performed using the formalism
of Coordinate Bethe Ansatz (CBA) and will be leading in the coupling expansion (our
states will be the eigenstates of the one-loop dilatation operators) but exact in the length
of the spin chain and of the part of it we cut, namely D.

In Section 3 we will calculate the EE of the superconformal primary operator with
two excitations in the BMN limit. We will derive an analytic expression for the EE of
which is exact in the coupling λ(cid:48) = g2
J 2 . This will allows us to analyse the eﬀect
of long-range interactions of the spin chain on the EE. In particular, we will see that the
EE of a part of the spin chain is a monotonically increasing function of the coupling which
saturates to a constant value as λ(cid:48) → ∞ when keeping the length of the chain we cut ﬁxed.
This results to a violation of a certain bound for the EE that is present at weak coupling.
Thus, one of our main conclusions is that, as it is physically anticipated, the entanglement
between parts of the chain becomes stronger as one increases the coupling λ(cid:48), at least for
the superconformal primary operator with two excitations.

In Section 4 we will employ integrability and more precisely the powerful formalism
of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) in order to calculate numerically the EE of excited
states with up to seven magnons in the SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2) subsectors. Finally, in
Section 5 we will present our conclusions along with directions for future research.

2 Entanglement entropy of two magnons in the three rank one closed

subsectors of the N = 4 spin chain

As discussed in the introduction, it is of the outmost importance to calculate the EE for
the excited states of any physical system. This task is extremely diﬃcult but it could
provide highly non-trivial information about the physical system under consideration. For
example, the EE can be viewed as the order parameter characterising the phase transitions
which the system might undergo, (see e.g. [8]).

In this section, and having the AdS/CFT correspondence in mind, we will focus on
the case of two magnons propagating in the N = 4 SYM spin chain. In particular we will
consider operators in each of the three rank one closed subsectors of N = 4 SYM, namely
SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2). We will derive analytic expressions for any two magnon state
in all the aforementioned sectors by employing the CBA.

As is well known, the problem of ﬁnding the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the
dilatation operator of N = 4 SYM can be solved by mapping this operator to the Hamil-
tonian of a certain integrable long-range spin chain. Then one can apply the method of
Perturbative Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (PABA) to solve for the eigenstates and the eigen-
values. If one is restricted to the one loop case, then the powerful technique of the ABA
can be employed. It is this method that we will use in the following to obtain the EE for
spin chains with diﬀerent lengths and up to seven magnons.

2.1 Entanglement Entropy of the vacuum

We will take the operator corresponding to the vacuum state to be

Ovac ∼ Tr(cid:2)ZL(cid:3) .

(2.1)

– 3 –

This is a BPS operator whose engineering dimension is L. This dimension is not altered
by quantum corrections. The corresponding spin chain state is given by

L(cid:89)

| ↓(cid:105)vac =

⊗| ↓(cid:105)i .

(2.2)

i=1

When the system is in the ground state (2.2) the EE of any part of the spin chain D is
zero, i.e. SEE(D) = 0, since (2.2) can be written as a direct product of states at each site.

2.2 Entanglement Entropy of a state with one magnon

It is straightforward to consider the case where the wavefunction of the system is that of a
giant magnon with momentum p. Although this is not a legitimate state since the cyclicity
of the trace will necessarily set p = 0, one can consider this state as a building block of
states with more than one excitations. In a spin chain language the eigenstate of a giant
magnon is given by

|ψ(cid:105)magnon ∼ L(cid:88)

eipl | ↑l(cid:105) where

| ↑l(cid:105) =

l−1(cid:89)

⊗| ↓(cid:105)i ⊗ | ↑l(cid:105) ⊗ L(cid:89)

⊗| ↓(cid:105)i .

(2.3)

l=0

i=1

i=l+1

One can then use (2.3) to calculate the entanglement of a part of the chain with length
N to the rest of the spin chain. It is straightforward to show that the corresponding EE
reads [15]

S1m

EE(N ) = log

N

N − L

− L
N

.

(2.4)

Notice that this expression is independent of the momentum p with which the giant magnon
propagates.
In what follows we will see that the EE of any eigenstate of the one-loop
Hamiltonian in the SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2) sectors with M magnons, will have as an
upper bound the single magnon entropy of (2.4) multiplied by the number of magnons M

EE (N ) ≤ M S1m

EE(N ) .

(2.5)

2.3 Entanglement Entropy of a state with two magnons

After this warm up we will now turn to the case of two magnons propagating in the
SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2) spin chains. The ﬁrst step is to write the expression for the
wavefunction in the CBA. This reads

(cid:88)

1≤x1<x2≤L

|ψ(cid:105) =

ψ(x1, x2)|x1, x2(cid:105) with

ψ(x1, x2) = ei(p1x1 + p2x2) + S(p2, p1) ei(p2x1 + p1x2) .

(2.6)

In (2.6) L denotes the length of the spin chain, x1 and x2 the positions where the two
magnons are sitting and p1 and p2 = − p1 = − p are their momenta. Finally, S(p2, p1)
denotes the two-body scattering matrix in the sector under consideration. We will substi-
tute its speciﬁc value only at the end of the calculation and this will allow us to treat all
three sectors simultaneously.

– 4 –

The next step consists in splitting the spin chain in two parts, one from site number 1
to site number N which we will call part D and one from site number N + 1 to site number
L which we will call the complementary part of D, namely DC. Then one should take the
trace of the complete density matrix ρ = |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| with respect to the degrees of freedom of
the complementary part DC to obtain the reduced density matrix (RDM) corresponding
to the part D, that is

ρD = T rDC ρ .

(2.7)

In order to perform the tracing one has to distinguish three cases.

We should mention that λ1 and λ2 are the two eigenvalues of the 2× 2 matrix appearing in
(2.17) while α and β are given in (2.18). A few important comments are in order. Firstly,
the expression (2.20) gives the EE for all three closed rank one subsectors. The diﬀerence
between the three sectors enters through the diﬀerent values of the scattering matrices and
the corresponding quantisation of the momenta. Namely, we have

SSU (2)(p1, p2) =

(2.13), for instance) should be replaced by (cid:80)

Notice also that the sums over x1 and x2 appearing in all expressions above (see equation
when considering the SL(2) sector
since in this case both derivatives may sit at the same Z ﬁeld. Secondly, we should stress
that equation (2.20) gives the leading contribution to the EE in the coupling expansion.
As is well known, the N = 4 SYM dilatation operator and as a result its eigenvalues
receive corrections order by order in perturbation theory. These corrections will also aﬀect
the value of the EE. Our calculation, in this section, gives the leading term in the weak
coupling expansion of the EE. However, it is exact as a function of the spin chain length
L.

x1≤x2

Given the general expressions for the Renyi Entropy (2.19) and the EE (2.20), we are
now in position to plot the EE as a function of the size of the part of the spin chain we
cut. In ﬁgure 1 we present the EE for an excited state with two magnons in the SU (2)
sector. The quantum number specifying the momenta of the magnons is set to n = 1. The
results for the other two sectors are similar. On the left part of the ﬁgure one can see the
plot of the EE as a function of the position that we split the spin chain in two parts, D
and its complement DC. In the same plot we have also drawn twice the EE of a single
magnon, which is the upper bound for the EE of any state involving two magnons. One
can see that the bound is saturated at a two symmetric points, one on the left and one on
the right of the middle of the chain (see also the right part of Figure 7)2. To illustrate this
point we present the normalised EE, that is the ratio of (2.20) over twice the EE of the
single magnon, on the right part of the ﬁgure 1. In ﬁgure 2 we present the dependence of

2This is not the case for the SL(2) subsector where the bound is saturated when we cut the spin chain

in two equal parts, see Figure 9.

Figure 1. In this ﬁgure we present the EE for an excited state with two magnons in the SU (2)
sector. On the left part of the ﬁgure it is the plot of the EE as a function of the position that we
split the spin chain in two parts, D and its complement DC. In order to simplify notation and to
be able to compare spin chains with diﬀerent number of sites we normalize the horizontal axis and
plot with respect to the ratio of the splitting point divided by the length of the spin chain. In all
the subsequent plots of the EE the horizontal axis will be in units of this “normalized splitting”.
The black curve is twice the EE of a single magnon while the magenta dots represent the actual
computation of the EE, using (2.20), when the scattering of the two magnons is taken into account.
On the right part of the ﬁgure, in order to illustrate the saturation points, we present the normalized
EE (i.e. dividing (2.20) by twice the EE of a single magnon). The calculations are for mode number

the diﬀerence between the aforementioned bound and the EE of two magnon excited state
on the mode number n, which characterises the excited state. Generically, as one moves
towards the centre of the chain the diﬀerence oscillates with an amplitude that decreases.
Furthermore, as one increases the mode number from one to four the bound is saturated
for speciﬁc values of the length of the domain D for which the EE we calculated. If we
exclude the trivial cases where D is either the empty set or when D is the whole chain
the number of the saturation points is 2n, that is twice the excitation number. A ﬁnal
comment concerns the expected fact that the plots for the EE are symmetric with respect
to the centre of the spin chain. This is a consequence of the well-known fact that the EE’s
of D and of its complementary DC are equal SEE(D) = SEE(DC) when the state which
describes the system as a whole D ∪ DC is a pure state.

The aim of the next section will be to analyse the eﬀect of interactions to the EE. To
this end we will focus on the BMN limit of AdS5 × S5 and ﬁnd the exact, in the coupling,
expression for the EE.

3 All-loop Entanglement and Renyi Entropies of the superconformal pri-

mary operator with two excitations in the BMN limit

One of the most interesting limits of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the so-called BMN
limit [16]. The reason is that in this limit, known as the Penrose or pp-wave limit on the
gravity side, the Green-Schwarz superstring action for type IIB strings becomes quadratic
in the light-cone variables and as a result one can solve for the superstring spectrum

exactly. This result provides an all-orders prediction for the anomalous dimensions of
certain operators with large R-charge [17] which are dual to the string states propagating
in the pp-wave background. Subsequently, one can study the dynamics of the theory by
employing string ﬁeld theory to construct the three-string vertex (see [18–20] and references
therein) and compare the so-obtained string amplitudes to the corresponding three-point
correlators [21–23]3.

3.1 The superconformal primary operator with two impurities in the BMN

limit

In this subsection, we will brieﬂy review the construction of the superconformal primary
state involving two excitations (impurities) on both the string and gauge theory side. The
full supermultiplet based on this primary state was constructed in [27] at leading order in
the coupling expansion. In what follows, we will closely follow [22, 28]. The main idea is to
use the action of the superalgebra on the states of the theory in order to resolve the operator
mixing appearing in the wavefunction of the primary operator. More precisely, consider
the non-BPS highest weight state (HWS) with two impurities which we will denote by On.
By deﬁnition this state should be annihilated by the sixteen superconformal generators

3For weak/strong coupling comparisons of three-point correlators see also [24–26].

[S,On(x = 0)] = 0

and

[Q,On(x = 0)] (cid:54)= 0 .

(3.1)

The action of the remaining sixteen supersymmetry generators, collectively denoted here
by Q, on the HWS generates the whole supermultiplet with two impurities. Equation (3.1)
should be implemented order by order in perturbation theory since the superconformal
charges receive quantum corrections [22, 28]. However in the pp-wave limit the 32 super-
charges can be straightforwardly constructed order by order in the string coupling. What
is important for us is that their leading in gs expressions are known to all-orders in the
eﬀective Yang-Mills coupling λ(cid:48) = g2
Y M N is the ’t Hooft coupling while J
is the large R-charge of the operator which correspond to the angular momentum of the
point-like string orbiting around one of the equators of the ﬁve-sphere S5 of the parent
AdS5 × S5 background. Demanding that the full set of the 16 superconformal charges an-
nihilates the HWS one can determine the form of the latter to all orders in λ(cid:48). The details
of this construction can be found in [28]. The result for the two-impurity HWS reads

One important comment is in order. Notice that the HWS string state, as well as the
corresponding ﬁeld theory operator On, exhibits the important feature of mixing between
diﬀerent kinds of excitations, namely bosonic and fermionic states (operators) mix among
each other as long as the mixing states have the same quantum numbers.

Needless to say that this construction can be generalised to HWS with more than two

impurities.

3.2 Exact in λ(cid:48) Entanglement Entropy

Our aim in this section is to derive, based on (3.2), an analytic expression for the EE of
the two impurity primary operator which is exact in the BMN coupling λ(cid:48). This expression
will be an interpolating function from the weak coupling regime λ(cid:48) → 0 to the strong
coupling regime λ(cid:48) → ∞. We should stress that our result is exact in the strict BMN

limit and generically will receive 1/J corrections. It would be interesting to calculate these
corrections by going to the near-BMN limit.

The ﬁrst step towards this end is to rewrite (3.2) as an operator of N = 4 SYM. An
important observation is that due to mixing of diﬀerent kinds of impurities this operator
can not be restricted in one of the closed subsectors of N = 4 SYM but ”lives” in the full
P SU (2, 2|4) superalgebra. The ﬁeld theory operator which is dual to the string state (3.2)
can be written as follows

In (3.4) ψA (with A = 1, 2, 3, 4) denote the four fermions of N = 4 SYM while α = 1, 2
and ˙α = 1, 2 are spinor indices over which we sum. Furthermore, N0 = N
8π2 where N is the
number of colours. We should mention that in order to translate the string state (3.2) to
the ﬁeld theory operator (3.4) we have used the prescription of [28]. Namely, we have used
the following dictionary

is the sum of the ﬁrst two terms on the r.h.s. of (3.4). The string state on the

the corresponding gauge theory operator. In a similar fashion the term with the fermionic
oscillators in (3.2) corresponds to a ﬁeld theory operator with four fermions

theory operator are normalised to one. Since the two-point functions of operators involving
fermions or/and vector impurities have non-trivial space-time structure we have used the
prescription of [23, 29]. Once is given an operator it is possible to deﬁne the barred one,
which is the conjugate of the initial operator followed by an inversion.
It is then this
operator which is used in the calculation of the two-point function. This prescription is
motivated by the radial quantisation in two-dimensional CFT’s and results to two-point
functions which can be easily normalised to one.

One can now use the following relation

(3.8)

as well as the analogous equation for the fermionic term to rewrite (3.4) as a spin chain
wavefunction. To achieve this one should take into account the fact that p1 = p = −p2 =
2πn/J << 1 and as a result to leading order in the large J expansion e±ip ≈ 1 and

cos(cid:0)πn/(J + 3)(cid:1) ≈ 1. Furthermore, we will make use of the following correspondence

In conclusion the wavefunction of the non-BPS primary operator with two excitations can
be written in the spin chain language as (we suppress the index ”sp” since from now on we
will be using only the spin chain wavefunctions) follows

A couple of important comments are in order. As is stressed in [17] the N = 4 SYM
spin chain is dynamic in the sense that the length of the chain in not ﬁxed since diﬀerent
impurities have diﬀerent scaling dimensions. Indeed as can be seen from (3.4) the number
of Z ﬁelds is not the same in all terms. We should mention that each of the kets written in
(3.10) describe two excitations in the appropriate number of Z ﬁelds dictated by (3.4). The
dynamic nature of the spin chain may result to a situation where both vector impurities
lie in the domain D but the scalar impurities lie on in D and one in its complementary.
This can happen when both excitations are close to the boundary of D. In what follows
we will ignore such circumstances since their contribution will be 1/J suppressed in the

– 12 –

BMN limit. As second related comment concerns the exact form of (3.4). As is well-known
the exact expression for the eigenstate of the dilatation operator will have non-asymptotic
terms where the two impurities will be close to each other. As it happens with the two-point
functions one can show that these terms give a contribution which is also 1/J suppressed
with respect to the contributions coming from the asymptotic terms and as such can be
ignored in the strict BMN limit where J → ∞. Finally, let us notice that the state (3.4)
may, in principle, be taken from considering the scattering of two scalar impurities with a
double copy of the SU (2|2) scattering matrix of [17].

We are now in position to write down the RDM originating from the wavefunction
above. As usual we will be cutting the spin chain into two parts. One part is from site 1 to
site N , which is the domain D of which the EE we intend to calculate, while the remaining
part is the complementary DC whose degrees of freedom we have to trace out in order to
obtain the RDM. Furthermore, as in the case of two magnons at weak coupling (see section
2) by |ψD(cid:105) we denote the wavefunction of the part D when both magnons sit in the region
D, while by |ψC
D(cid:105) we denote the wavefunction of the complementary region DC when both
(cid:33)
magnons sit in the region Dc. After these explanations the RDM can be written as

from each other.

A couple of comments are in order. The ﬁrst term in the ﬁrst line of (3.13) originates
from the partition where both magnons are in the region D, while the second term from
the partition where both magnons are in the complementary region DC. Furthermore, the
second line of (3.13) comes from part of the wavefunction which has a single impurity ¯Z.
Finally, the rest of the expression originates from the partition where one of the magnons
is in the region D and one in the complementary DC.

where all quantities are deﬁned in section 2. We should only add that A(1) = ASU (2) and
B(1) = BSU (2) are the SU (2) weak coupling expressions for A and B deﬁned in section 2 but
with SU (2) scattering matrix set to one, i.e. SSU (2)(p2, p1) = 1. Similarly, A(2) = ASU (1|1)
and B(2) = BSU (1|1) are the SU (1|1) weak coupling expressions for A and B deﬁned in
section 2 but with SU (1|1) scattering matrix set to minus one, i.e. SSU (1|1)(p2, p1) = −1.
Before we continue with the η → 1 limit and the calculation of the EE, we would like to
comment on the coeﬃcients of the diﬀerent contributions in (3.14) (namely scalar, fermion
and vector) and their η dependence.

The second line of (3.13) gives the last term in (3.14). The third line of (3.13) gives
the part of the third term in (3.14) which is proportional to 2η. This happens since i = 1, 2
so we have to raise two to the η-th power, i.e 2η. The fourth and ﬁfth lines of (3.13) give
the penultimate term in (3.14). Since α = 1, 2 and ˙α = 1, 2 we have to multiply Un by four

(cid:1)η. In the same fashion, since µ = 1, 2, 3, 4,

and then raise to the η-th power, i.e (cid:0)4 × U 2
(cid:16)

(cid:17)η

the ultimate term in (3.13) has to be multiplied by four and then raised to the η-th power,

where (cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105)SU (2) and (cid:104)ψ|ψ(cid:105)SU (1|1) denote the inner product for the eigenstate of the one-
loop dilatation operator in the SU (2) and SU (1|1) sectors, respectively. These are deﬁned
in section 2.

Now having at hand the analytic expressions for both the Renyi entropy (3.14) and
the EE (3.15), we will probe the parametric space and extract interesting qualitative be-
haviours. As can be seen from both (3.14) & (3.15) both quantities depend on the position
we split the spin chain in two parts (D and its complement DC), the coupling constant
λ(cid:48) and the mode number n characterising the excited state4. In ﬁgure 3 we present the
EE for an excited state with n = 1 in the BMN limit. On the left part of the ﬁgure it is
the plot of the EE as a function of the normalised splitting of the spin chain, for diﬀerent
values of λ(cid:48). As can be seen from the plot (the correspondence colour/λ(cid:48) is explained in the
caption of the ﬁgure) the EE increases as we increase the value of the coupling. To fully
realise/visualise this EE ﬂow from the UV to IR, on the right part of ﬁgure 3 we present
the EE as a function of the coupling λ(cid:48), for diﬀerent values of the splitting point of the spin

4Renyi entropy depends also on the order η.

Figure 3. In this ﬁgure we present the EE for an excited state with two magnons in the BMN
limit. The mode number of the state is taken to be n = 1. On the left part of the ﬁgure it is the
plot of the EE as a function of the normalised splitting of the spin chain, for diﬀerent values of
λ(cid:48). The correspondence between colour and λ(cid:48) is the following: Red ⇒ λ(cid:48) = 0, Green ⇒ λ(cid:48) = 0.1,
Yellow ⇒ λ(cid:48) = 1 & Magenta ⇒ λ(cid:48) = 5. On the right part of the ﬁgure we present the EE ﬂow from
the IR (lower values of λ(cid:48)) to the UV (higher values of λ(cid:48)) as we change the splitting point of the
spin chain. In order to compare the diﬀerent curves we have normalised each one by dividing with
the EE for λ(cid:48) → ∞. In this way all the curves approximate to one. The correspondence between
colours and normalised splitting (e.g. N/L) of the spin chain is the following: Red ⇒ 0.5, Green
⇒ 0.1, Yellow ⇒ 0.01 & Magenta ⇒ 0.001.

Since the EE is related to the central charge of the underlying CFT, this monotonically
decreasing behaviour of the EE along the RG ﬂow from λ(cid:48) → ∞ to λ(cid:48) → 0 could be related
to the existence of a c-theorem [31, 32], which connects through an RG ﬂow a ﬁxed point
in the UV with another ﬁxed point in the IR.

As we pointed out in (2.5) and veriﬁed with the calculations of the EE for the three
diﬀerent rank one sectors in section 2, the EE of a single magnon multiplied by the number
of impurities (two in our case) appears to be an upper bound for the EE. As can be seen
from the two plots of ﬁgure 4 this bound is violated as soon as we move away from the
λ(cid:48) → 0 limit. In order to underline the violation of this bound for ﬁnite λ(cid:48) in ﬁgure 4 we
plot the the diﬀerence between the EE in the BMN limit and twice the EE of the single
magnon, when we increase the mode number (from mode number one/left to two/right),
for diﬀerent values of λ(cid:48). As can be seen from the plots, when the coupling increases it is
possible to ﬁnd pieces of the spin chain with EE that violate the bound and as we increase
the value of λ(cid:48) more and more pieces acquire EE that violate the bound. Gradually all
the pieces of the spin chain will violate the bound and the bigger is the mode number the
faster (i.e. with lower value of λ(cid:48)) this violation will be implemented. The smaller the part
of the chain we cut the more we have to increase the value of λ(cid:48) to violate the bound. In

between color and Renyi order is the following: Red ⇒ η = 1, Green ⇒ η = 2, Blue ⇒ η = 5

dividing with the Renyi entropy for λ(cid:48) → ∞. The correspondence between color and Renyi order
is the following: Red ⇒ η = 1, Green ⇒ η = 2 & Magenta ⇒ η = 10.

In ﬁgure 6 we highlight the ﬂow of the Renyi entropy from the UV to IR (besides that
of the EE that we already saw in ﬁgure 3). In this ﬁgure we present the normalised Renyi
entropy (see (3.18) for the deﬁnition of this normalisation) ﬂow (of diﬀerent orders) from
the IR (lower values of λ(cid:48)) to the UV (higher values of λ(cid:48)), as we change the normalised
splitting. From these plots it is clear that increasing the order (or decreasing the length of
the spin chain we cut) decreases the diﬀerence between the IR and the UV values of the
Renyi entropy.

4 Entanglement Entropy from the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz

In this section we concentrate on the case where there is an arbitrary number of excitations
(magnons) propagating in the spin chain. In such a case the method used in the previous
section for the case of two magnons becomes cumbersome because of the large number of
excitations. However, it is the formalism of ABA that comes to rescue in this occasion.
Following the same reasoning as before, we split the spin chain of length L in two pieces.
The ﬁrst piece which we call D contains the sites from 1 to N , while its complementary DC
contains the sites from N + 1 to L. In the ABA language the wavefunction |ψ(cid:105) describing
the excited state is characterised by a set of M numbers {ui}, i = 1, 2, ..., M . The ui’s are
called the rapidities of the M magnons and for an on-shell state they should satisfy the
Bethe equations of the corresponding sector. Thus,

|ψ(cid:105) = |{ui}(cid:105) =

H(a, ¯a)|al(cid:105) ⊗ |¯ar(cid:105) ,

(4.1)

(cid:88)
a(cid:83) ¯a = {ui}

where the sum is over all the possible partitions of the M magnons into two sets. If for
example we have two magnons, as in the cases of the CBA we worked so far, the possible
partitions are ({},{u1, u2}) , ({u1},{u2}) , ({u2},{u1}) & ({u1, u2},{}). The set of magnons
with rapidities al are sitting in the left part of the spin chain, that is in region D, while the
set of magnons with rapidities ar are sitting in the complementary region of the chain, that

– 18 –

�����λ′��������������������������������������������λ′���������������������������������������is DC. The function H(a, ¯a) describes the weight of each partition, it is diﬀerent in each
rank one subsector of the N = 4 SYM and its form is given by (for the various functions
appearing in (4.2) see also Appendix A)

Starting from (4.1) it is now straightforward to evaluate the RDM

for the basis ¯cr

(cid:88)

¯cr

|¯cr(cid:105)(cid:104)¯cr| = Ir .

Here we should stress that because the scalar product of two states involving diﬀerent
numbers of magnons is zero the RDM can be written as a sum of terms each of which
has a deﬁnite number of excitations m in the region D. Subsequently, for each of these
terms one has to sum over all possible partitions of the full set of rapidities into two sets,
one having m excitations and its complementary having M − m excitations. Notice that
the scalar products appearing in the second line of (4.3) are generic oﬀ-sell products, since
none of the sets of rapidities ¯ar nor ¯br satisfy the Bethe equations for the complementary
region of the spin chain. This scalar product is given in terms of the recursion relation in
equation (A.10). The normalisation constant κ is obtained by demanding the condition

A ﬁnal comment concerns the dimensionality of the matrices F (m), f (m) and g(m). The
dimensionality of each of these square matrices depend on the number m of magnons sitting
in the region D and is given by

d(m) ≡

M !

m!(M − m)!

.

(4.7)

As we will see in a while it is the matrices F (m) which one has to diagonalise in order to
calculate the EE. As a result the numerical complexity of the calculation grows not with

– 19 –

the number of the sites of the region D of which the EE we are after, but like 2M , that is
with the number of magnons running in the spin chain. This advantage is related to the
fact that we have employed the powerful technique of the ABA and not that of the CBA.
We are now in position to evaluate the η-th power of the RDM and take its trace to

obtain the Renyi Entropy of the region D as follows

Thus we see that in order to evaluate the Renyi entropy we need to diagonalise the matrices
κ F (m) and sum their eigenvalues after they are raised to the ηth power. By taking the
η → 1 limit of the Renyi entropy it is straightforward to show that the EE is given by

Thus, as mentioned above, it is enough to diagonalise each of the matrices κF (m). If we
denote the eigenvalues of each of these matrices by λ(m)
i with i = 1, 2, . . . , d(m) then the
EE of the part D of the spin chain can be ﬁnally written as

In the ﬁnal expression (4.10), the EE of each one of the three rank one sectors of
N = 4 SYM is a function of the length of the spin chain, the position we split it in two
parts (D and its complement DC) and the number of excitations (magnons). In ﬁgures 7
& 8 we focus on the SU (2) sector of the theory. On the left part of ﬁgure 7 we plot the
EE of a spin chain with 14 sites as a function of the position of the splitting point. We
plot the EE for diﬀerent number of magnons, from two to seven. At this point we should
point out that there is a perfect match of the EE for the two magnons, between the CBA
and the ABA calculations (for all the three rank-one subsectors). That was a non-trivial
consistency check for the calculations that we present.

The Bethe roots we use in the calculation of the EE are coming after solving the Bethe
equation, with the recursive method of [34], and distribute themselves along two disjoint
cuts on the complex plane5. As can be seen from this plot the EE increases as we increase
the number of the magnons, but the qualitative behaviour remains the same. It increases
as the splitting point approaches the middle of the chain and it is symmetric under the
change N (splitting point) → L − N .

The recursive method we are using for the calculation of the Bethe roots is not converg-
ing when the number of magnons is more than half of the length of the spin chain, but this

is not the only reason we constrain our calculation/analysis to seven magnons (for 14 sites).
Even if we had the Bethe roots for eight or more magnons, reaching the thermodynamic
limit (which was our initial motivation in employing the very eﬃcient ABA formulation)
is a very complicated numerical task. As we mentioned before, the calculation of the EE
for M magnons in a spin chain boils down to diagonalising matrices with dimension d(m).
This means that either a very powerful machine is needed or the problem needs to be
formulated in a diﬀerent basis when the number of magnons increases.

Figure 7. In this ﬁgure we present the EE of an excited state in the SU (2) sector. On the left
part of the ﬁgure it is the plot of the EE as a function of the normalised splitting of the spin chain.
On the right part of the ﬁgure it is the plot of the normalised EE (i.e. the EE for M magnons
divided by M times the EE of one magnon) again as a function of the normalised splitting. The
diﬀerent colours for the bullets in both plots correspond to diﬀerent number of magnons present in
the spin chain. The correspondence between colour and number of magnons is the following: Red
⇒ 2 magnons, Green ⇒ 3 magnons, Blue ⇒ 4 magnons, Black ⇒ 5 magnons, Cyan ⇒ 6 magnons
& Magenta ⇒ 7 magnons.

On the right panel of ﬁgure 7 we plot the normalised EE (i.e. the EE for M magnons
divided by M times the EE of one magnon) again as a function of the position of the
splitting point. We plot the EE for diﬀerent number of magnons and the behaviour is
diﬀerent to the one we noticed before. Now increasing the number of magnons decreases the
normalised EE. This plot captures the growing importance of scattering in the entanglement
of a state. Increasing scattering (by increasing the magnons) decreases the entanglement.
Notice also in the same plot, that the EE for two magnons saturates the bound (i.e. the
ratio is exactly one) not in the middle of the spin chain but at the splitting points 5 and
9. The maximum of the curve of the normalised EE is not in the middle also for the three
magnons, but eventually as we increase their number this maximum moves to the centre.
Until now we kept constant the length of the spin chain, modifying the number of
the magnons. In ﬁgure 8 we change this perspective, keeping constant the number of the
magnons while changing the length of the spin chain. As can be seen from all the plots of
ﬁgure 8, where we present the normalised EE (this is the only quantity that make sense
to compare) for diﬀerent number of magnons (from two to seven) when the length of the
spin chain changes, the behaviour is almost universal. When the number of the magnons
is small (from two to four) the curve almost does not change as we change the length of

length of the spin chain changes from L = 12 to L = 20. The correspondence between colour and
length of the spin chain is the following: Red ⇒ L = 12, Green ⇒ L = 14, Blue ⇒ L = 16, Black
⇒ L = 18 & Magenta ⇒ L = 20.

the spin chain. Increasing the number of the magnons, we notice two eﬀects depending on
the length of the part of the spin chain we cut: When the length of the cut piece is small
the EE increases when we increase the length of the spin chain, while the opposite happens
for the EE when the cut piece is close to the half of the spin chain.

In ﬁgures 9 and 10 we complete the computation of the EE for the three rank one
sectors of N = 4 SYM by repeating the calculation for the SL(2) and the SU (1|1) sec-
tors, respectively. In order to numerically perform these computations we use the same
MATHEMATICA code as for the SU (2) sector only changing accordingly the deﬁnitions
for the functions f , g, a & d, as they appear in equations (A.4) & (A.6), as well as the

– 22 –

������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������corresponding scattering matrices for the calculation of the Bethe roots.

Figure 9.
In this ﬁgure we repeat the calculations that we presented in ﬁgure 7, but for an
excited state in the SL(2) sector. The Bethe roots are sitting in two cuts on the real axis. The
correspondence between colour and number of magnons is the following: Red ⇒ 2 magnons, Green
⇒ 3 magnons, Blue ⇒ 4 magnons, Black ⇒ 5 magnons, Cyan ⇒ 6 magnons & Magenta ⇒ 7
magnons.

The results for the EE of the SL(2) sector are similar to the ones of the SU (2) sector.
We should mention that we have chosen the excited states for which the Bethe roots are
sitting in two symmetric cuts on the real axis. In the plots of the normalised EE there
are though some diﬀerences. Notice that the EE for two magnons saturates the bound in
the middle of the spin chain and not in some other points as in the SU (2) case. Also the
maximum of the curve of the normalised EE is in the middle of the spin chain until we
have ﬁve magnons, but as we increase their number this maximum is not in the middle
any more. This is the inverse picture with respect to the observations of the SU (2) sector,
for the normalised EE.

Figure 10.
In this ﬁgure we repeat the calculations that we presented in ﬁgure 7, but for an
excited state in the SU (1|1) sector. The correspondence between colour and number of magnons is
the following: Red ⇒ 2 magnons, Green ⇒ 3 magnons, Blue ⇒ 4 magnons, Black ⇒ 5 magnons,
Cyan ⇒ 6 magnons & Magenta ⇒ 7 magnons.

The EE of the of the SU (1|1) sector has some diﬀerences with respect to the other two,

– 23 –

����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������namely of the SU (2) & SL(2). As can be seen already from the left plot of ﬁgure 10 the
EE, in absolute numbers, in this sector is much less than the other two sectors. Of course
the Bethe roots are diﬀerent from sector to sector but here, and also in the similar plots
for the other two sectors, we have set the mode number to one when solving the Bethe
equations. The diﬀerence in the quantitative behaviour of the SU (1|1) sector is reﬂected
more in the right plot of ﬁgure 10. Here the normalised EE never saturates the bound,
even for the case of the two magnons, and moreover the maximum of the curve is when we
cut the the shortest possible piece of the spin chain. The minimum of the curve is always
when we cut the spin chain in the middle. Finally, in agreement with the other two sectors
increasing the number of magnons decreases the normalised EE.

Closing this section we should mention the following. The EE besides the length, the
splitting position and the number of magnons depends also on a mode number, which is
coming through the solution of the Bethe equation and characterises the Bethe roots. We
have checked that the qualitative behaviour of the EE does not change as we change this
mode number, even though the absolute numbers are altered.

5 Conclusions and future directions

The aim of this paper was to exploit integrability in order to shed some light to the
behaviour of the Entanglement and Renyi Entropies of the N = 4 SYM spin chain. Gener-
ically, the Entanglement and Renyi Entropies depend on the lengths of the spin chain and
of the domain of it that we cut, as well as on the details of the excited state whose entropy
we are after. These details are the number of propagating magnons, their rapidities and the
particular sector on which we focus. Furthermore, since the dilatation operator of N = 4
receives quantum corrections its eigenstates and the associated with them Entanglement
and Renyi Entropies will depend on the ’t Hooft coupling λ. Our goal was to address these
questions about how the EE depends on the aforementioned parameters.

After providing the reader with the results for the EE of the vacuum and the single
magnon state we analytically calculated the EE of excited states with two magnons in
all closed rank one subsectors of N = 4 SYM, namely SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2). Our
calculation was performed using the formalism of the Coordinate Bethe Ansatz and was
leading in the coupling expansion (our states were eigenstates of the one-loop dilatation
operators) but exact in the length of the spin chain and of the part of it we cut.

Y M N
J 2 = λ

In Section 3 we calculated the EE of the superconformal primary operator with two
excitations in the BMN limit. We derived an analytic expression for the EE which is exact
in the coupling λ(cid:48) = g2
J 2 and interpolates between the weak λ(cid:48) = 0 and strong
coupling regimes λ(cid:48) → ∞. This allowed us to analyse the eﬀect of long-range interactions
of the spin chain on the EE. We have found that the EE of a part of the spin chain is a
monotonically increasing function of the coupling which saturates to a constant value as
λ(cid:48) → ∞ when we keep the length of the chain we cut ﬁxed. This results to a violation
of a certain bound for the EE that is present at weak coupling. Thus, one of our main
conclusions is that, as it is physically anticipated, the entanglement between parts of the

– 24 –

chain becomes stronger as one increases the coupling λ(cid:48), at least for the superconformal
primary operator with two excitations.

In Section 4 we employed integrability, and more precisely the powerful formalism of
the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz in order to calculate numerically the EE of excited states with
up to seven magnons in the SU (2), SU (1|1) and SL(2) subsectors. In the SU (2) and SL(2)
subsectors we have focused on excited state corresponding to 2-cut solutions of the Bethe
equations. Although the absolute value of the EE increases with the number of magnons,
its normalised value, that is the EE for an M magnon excited state divided by M times
the EE of one magnon, decreases with the the number of magnons. Some diﬀerences in
the behaviour of the EE as a function of the magnon number for the two bosonic sectors
are scrutinised in Section 4. The diﬀerent statistics of excited states in the SU (1|1) sector
lead to a diﬀerent qualitative behaviour of the normalised EE. In this sector the normalised
EE never saturates the bound, even for the case of the two magnons, and moreover the
maximum of the curve is when we cut the the shortest possible piece of the spin chain.
The minimum of the curve is always when we cut the spin chain in the middle. Finally,
in agreement with the other two sectors increasing the number of magnons decreases the
normalised EE.

A number of very interesting questions remain to be answered. First of all from the
perspective of the AdS/CFT correspondence it is important if the calculation of Section 4
for the SU (2) and SL(2) sectors could be performed for a larger number of magnons, as
well as for longer spin chains. This would allow one to approach the thermodynamic limit
in which case the spin chain states will be dual to certain semi-classical string solutions.
However, it seems that for this to be achieved a reformulation of the problem will be needed.
In particular one should need to obtain expressions for the product of two oﬀ-shell states in
the thermodynamic limit. One can then address the question of what is the precise relation
between the entropy calculated from the spin chain approach and the one which one may
calculate from the dual solutions of the non-linear σ–model 6. The same question can be
asked about the exact in λ(cid:48) EE which we have calculated in Section 3. Furthermore, it
would be interesting to generalise the calculation of Section 3 to the case of superconformal
primary operators with more than two excitations. Another direction would be to calculate
the 1

J corrections to the BMN EE by considering the near BMN limit.
One could also employ the Perturbative Bethe Ansatz technique to calculate the g2

Y M N
corrections to the EE, as an order by order expansion in perturbation theory. One should of
course interpret the fact that eigenstates of the dilatation operators (and as a consequence
the corresponding EE) will be scheme-dependent. Notice that such a complication is absent
both in the BMN limit considered in Section 3 and in the leading in g2
Y M N calculations of
Section 4.

6One comment is in order. Notice that while in our calculations the EE is always ﬁnite (even at the
BMN limit where J → ∞) while in all the ﬁeld theory calculations that appear in the literature (see e.g.
[36]) for free ﬁeld theories the EE is divergent when the cut-oﬀ a is sent to zero.

In order to simplify the expressions we introduce the following shorthand notation

F (ui − vj) ,

F (ui − uj) .

(A.8)

F a ≡ (cid:89)

uj∈ a

F (uj) ,

F a¯a ≡(cid:89)

ui ∈ a
vj ∈ ¯a

< ≡ (cid:89)

F aa

ui, uj ∈ a

i < j

Now we can write the expression for the function H(a, ¯a), that weights the diﬀerent parti-
tions of the spin chain, according to the algebraic normalizations of [37]

H(a, ¯a) = f a¯a da

r a¯a
l ,

(A.9)

where al and dr are deﬁned as in equations (A.1), (A.4) & (A.6), but using instead of L
the lengths for the left and the right subchain respectively.

Scalar Product

In order to compute the RDM we need to evaluate the scalar product between two Bethe
wavefunctions for arbitrary {u} and {v}. A recursion relation for such an expression is
computed analytically in references [37] and [38]. Here, for completeness, we present the
outcome of that computation.

Consider two Bethe states, which are parametrized by ui and vi, with i = 1, . . . , N .
The scalar product SN ({v},{u}) ≡ (cid:104){v∗}|{u}(cid:105) is given by the following recursion relation
bn SN−1 ({v1, . . . , ˆvn, . . . , vN},{ˆu1, u2, . . . , uN})

SN ({v1, . . . , vN},{u1, . . . , uN}) =

(cid:88)

cn,m SN−1 ({u1, v1, . . . ˆvn, . . . , ˆvm, . . . vN},{ˆu1, u2, . . . , uN}) ,

(A.10)

n

−(cid:88)

n<m

where a Bethe root with a hat means that it is omitted. The deﬁnitions for bn and cn,m
are the following

bn = g(u1 − vn)a(vn)d(u1)

f (u1 − vj) f (vj − vn) + (u1 ↔ vn) ,

(A.11)

N(cid:89)

j(cid:54)=n

cn,m = g(u1 − vn) g(u1 − vm) a(vm) d(vn) f (vn − vm)

N(cid:89)

j(cid:54)=n,m

f (vn−vj) f (vj−vm) + (n ↔ m) .

(A.12)

Using (A.10) and substituting the corresponding expressions for the functions f (u), g(u), a(u)
and d(u) (from either (A.1), (A.4) or (A.6)), it is possible to calculate the scalar product
for any of the rank one subsectrors.
