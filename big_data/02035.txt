We investigate the magnetic minibands of a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene (BLG)
and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) by numerically diagonalizing a two-band Hamiltonian that
describes electrons in BLG in the presence of a moir´e potential. Due to inversion-symmetry breaking
characteristic for the moir´e potential, the valley symmetry of the spectrum is broken, but despite
this, the zero-energy Landau level in BLG survives, albeit with reduced degeneracy. In addition,
we derive eﬀective models for the low-energy features in the magnetic minibands and demonstrate
the appearance of secondary Dirac points in the valence band, which we conﬁrm by numerical
simulations. Then, we analyze how single-particle gaps in the fractal energy spectrum produce a
sequence of incompressible states observable under a variation of carrier density and magnetic ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

Long-period moir´e patterns are characteristic of well-
aligned graphene heterostructures with hBN. They oﬀer
an experimentally-viable route [1–3] to observe fractal
magnetic miniband spectra generic for electrons in two-
dimensional superlattices in strong magnetic ﬁelds [4–
6]. These fractal miniband spectra, also known as Hof-
stadter’s butterﬂies [7], reﬂect the fact that the trans-
lational symmetry of a lattice, suppressed by the pres-
ence of a magnetic vector potential
in the electron’s
Schr¨odinger equation, is restricted to magnetic ﬁeld val-
ues Bp/q = (p/q)φ0/S corresponding to a rational frac-
tion p/q of magnetic ﬂux quantum φ0 = h/e per unit
cell area S of the lattice [4–6]. The generic features of
fractal magnetic miniband spectra have been observed
[1, 3, 8, 9] and modeled [8, 10–16] in monolayer graphene
heterostructures with hBN, where the properties of Dirac
electrons at the conduction/valence band edge allow for
a straightforward interpretation of experimental observa-
tions, and have also been studied in slightly misaligned
pairs of graphene ﬂakes [17, 18]. Modeling of the fractal
magnetic miniband spectra of a bilayer graphene/hBN
heterostructure is much more limited [13], even though
one of the ﬁrst observations of this phenomena was in
this system [2].

In this Article, we study fractal magnetic minibands in
bilayer graphene (BLG) subject to a moir´e superlattice
perturbation due to an hBN underlay. The low-energy
Hofstadter butterﬂy spectra of a BLG-hBN heterostruc-
ture is dominated by bands related to the degenerate
“zero-energy” Landau level (LL) states n = 0 and n = 1
of unperturbed BLG [19]. We use a symmetry-based ap-
proach to model the inﬂuence of hBN on electrons in
BLG, and we show that the spectra in BLG-hBN is a su-
perposition of two very diﬀerent miniband spectra asso-
ciated with electrons in opposite valleys (Brillouin zone
corners) of BLG’s band structure: the miniband spec-

trum in one valley is only weakly broadened by the super-
lattice potential and incorporates one unperturbed n = 0
LL, while the miniband spectrum in the other valley is
widely broadened. This valley asymmetry arises from
spatial inversion symmetry breaking produced by the fact
that the moir´e perturbation only directly aﬀects one of
the two BLG layers. Since the zero energy LL states re-
side on diﬀerent layers in opposite valleys, in one valley
they are strongly inﬂuenced by the moir´e perturbation,
but in the other valley they are not.

These qualitative features agree with the results of the
tight-binding model of Moon and Koshino [13]. In ad-
dition, we characterize diﬀerent types of moir´e superlat-
tice perturbations including the possibilities that the per-
turbation creates potential asymmetry between the car-
bon atoms in BLG or introduces a spatial modulation of
the nearest-neighbor carbon-carbon hopping amplitude.
Hence, we ﬁnd that the Dirac point at the conduction-
valence band edge can be either gapless or gapped, and
that a secondary Dirac point can appear in the valence
band of BLG-hBN. Our model Hamiltonian is presented
in Section II and its numerical diagonalization in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, including methodology, re-
sults and discussion, is described in Section III, where
we also derive simple eﬀective Hamiltonians to describe
low-energy features in the magnetic minibands and, also,
an eﬀective Hamiltonian to describe the secondary Dirac
point. In Section IV, we show how gaps in the fractal en-
ergy spectrum are manifest as observable incompressible
states under a variation of carrier density and magnetic
ﬁeld.

BLG can be described [19] using a simpliﬁed two-band
Hamiltonian, which can be obtained from Eq. (1) by a
Schrieﬀer-Wolf projection onto the basis of Bloch states
residing on A1 and B2 sublattices. For a BLG-hBN het-
erostructure, such a projection results in [22],

II. MOIR´E SUPERLATTICE HAMILTONIAN

A. Four band model

To describe the sublattice (A/B) and bottom/top
(1/2) layer composition of electron states in Bernal-
stacked BLG on a hBN underlay, we write down their
Hamiltonian [19] as a 4 × 4 matrix,

and the 2 × 2 Pauli matrices σ1,2,3 act in the space of
sublattice components. The term v ˆp·σ on the diagonal
takes into account the electrons’ Dirac spectrum in each
layer where v (cid:39) 108 cm s−1 [20] is the Dirac velocity,
ˆp = −i∇ + eA, [∇× A]z = −B, σ = (σx, σy), and  = 1,

The term ˆMξ in Eq. (1) accounts for the moir´e su-

which is closest to the hBN (layer ‘1’) [22]. Within the

), where ˆRϕ describes anti-clockwise
rotation by angle ϕ, δ ≈ 1.8% takes into account the rel-
ative lattice mismatch between graphene and hBN [23], θ
is the misalignment angle between the two hexagonal lat-
tices and l = 2.46 ˚A is the lattice constant of graphene.
For θ (cid:28) 1, b = |bm| ≈ 4π√
δ2 + θ2 so that the en-
ergy scale vb obtains its minimum value of vb ≈ 0.35 eV
at θ = 0. The strength of the various terms included
in ˆMξ are controlled by separate dimensionless parame-
ters, ui=0,3,1, which describe in turn an electrostatic po-
tential which does not distinguish between the two car-
bon sublattices (u0), a sublattice-asymmetric part of the
potential (u3), and a spatial modulation of the nearest-
neighbor carbon-carbon hopping amplitude (u1).

B. Two band model

One of the most interesting features of electrons in
BLG at strong magnetic ﬁelds is the degeneracy of two
orbital LLs, with n = 0 and n = 1, which appear at  = 0,
the edge between the valence and conduction band. The
mixing of these degenerate LLs by the moir´e superlat-
tice potential determines the main features of the lower-
energy part of the magnetic miniband spectrum, shown
in Fig. 1 for several diﬀerent choices of moir´e perturba-
tion parameters ui. These low-energy electron states in

Examples of the zero magnetic ﬁeld K-valley band-
structure of moir´e perturbed BLG with θ = 0 are dis-
played in the left panels of Fig. 1. These spectra were
calculated by numerical diagonalization of the Heisen-
berg matrix constructed from Hamiltonian (2) in a basis
of unperturbed plane wave states. The corresponding
dispersion in the K(cid:48)-valley is obtained using the relation,
K(cid:48)(k) = K(−k), which follows from the time-reversal
symmetry of Hamiltonians (1) and (2) for B = 0.
Each panel in Fig. 1 corresponds to a diﬀerent set of
moir´e perturbation parameters {u0, u1, u3}. The choice
of parameters used in the top panel corresponds to the
predictions of a pair of microscopic models, one based
on hopping between graphene carbon atoms and hBN
atoms, the other on scattering of graphene electrons by
the quadropole electric moments of nitrogen atoms. In-
terestingly, these two models predict the same relative
values for the moir´e potential parameters [10],

(sDP) is produced between the red and blue minibands
in the valence band of the upper left panel of Fig. 1. Sig-
natures of this feature were observed experimentally in
Ref. [2].

The other panels in Fig. 1 illustrate the inﬂuence of
each ui parameter taken individually and they exemplify
for u0,1,3 = {0.15, 0, 0}, the
three additional scenarios:
original Dirac point is gapped and there is no sDP (in
the two valence bands closest to zero energy); for u0,1,3 =

A. Methodology

Here we describe the numerical diagonalization of
Hamiltonian (2) in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. To

simplify this calculation, we take account of the hexag-
onal symmetry of the moir´e pattern and use a non-
orthogonal coordinate system [11] r = (x1a1 + x2a2)/a,
where a1 = 4πb1× ˆlz/(

are direct moir´e lattice vectors and a = |a1|.

In general, the magnetic vector potential A(x1) breaks

ﬂux φ = SB = p

of this, we consider a unit cell of the magnetic super-

moir´e superlattice in both directions (hence its area is q2
times larger) [4, 11]. The magnetic translational group

B. Results and discussion

The main panels of Fig. 1 show the magnetic spectrum
of the BLG-hBN heterostructure for the four choices of
moir´e perturbation described above. For small ﬂux, the
magnetic miniband spectra can be traced to the sequence
of Landau levels for moir´e perturbed BLG. Near zero en-
ergy, the gap at the original Dirac point is seen in the
magnetic spectra of the top two panels. The presence
or absence of a secondary Dirac point (depending on the
particular parameter set) is also clearly reﬂected in the
magnetic spectra at small ﬂux at the corresponding en-
ergy. At a higher ﬂux, the Landau levels broaden and
split, forming a fractal pattern, with the most striking
features around zero energy.

For all parameter sets, the valley symmetry of the spec-
trum, preserved in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, is
lifted. This is because the moir´e perturbation only af-
fects the layer of BLG that is adjacent to the hBN and,
thus, it breaks inversion symmetry. In conjunction with
time-inversion symmetry breaking by a magnetic ﬁeld,
this allows the energy spectra for electrons in valleys K
and K(cid:48) to be diﬀerent [13]. In particular, note that, in
the absence of the perturbation, the distribution of the
wave function among the layers is, for a given Landau
level, exactly inverted in the two valleys, Eqs. (5,6). The
moir´e potential aﬀects only the wave function component
in the layer adjacent to hBN, hence breaking the layer
symmetry and leading to valley-asymmetric spectra with
a gap.

Importantly, the spectrum in the valley for which the
wave function sits on the layer further from the substrate
contains a zero-energy Landau level completely decou-
pled from the rest of the spectrum (shown as a red line
in the K(cid:48)-valley in Fig. 1). The spinor structure Eq. (5)
of the two zero-energy states, n = 0, 1, for unperturbed
electrons shows that the states in valley K (K(cid:48)) are local-
ized on the bottom (top) graphene layer only [19]. Since
the moir´e perturbation does not directly inﬂuence the
top layer, it does not couple the n = 0 state in the K(cid:48)
valley to any other state and, thus, the n = 0 state in this
valley always persists. This coexistence of a zero-energy
LL and a fractal spectrum of magnetic sub-bands creates
a unique opportunity to observe the interplay between
electron-electron interaction and Hofstadter’s quantiza-
tion [9, 24].

{0.032,−0.063,−0.055} (upper panel), the B = 0 mini-
band spectrum displays a slightly gapped sDP found in
the ﬁrst valence miniband, which produces a sequence
of LL including tilted zeroth LLs, at the correspond-
ing energy and weak magnetic ﬁelds ( ≈ −0.22 vb
φ/φ0 (cid:46) 0.2). We shall discuss the sDP further in Sec-
tion III D (a similar feature is present in the lower mid-
dle panel). For potential modulation taken in isolation,
u0,1,3 = {0.15, 0, 0}, the band structure obeys six-fold ro-
tation symmetry in each valley (left upper middle panel),
in contrast to all other band structure images which only
display symmetry under three-fold rotation. For the spa-
tial modulation of the carbon-carbon hopping amplitude,
u0,1,3 = {0, 0.15, 0} (lower middle panels), the spectrum
at both zero magnetic ﬁeld and ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld
obeys electron-hole symmetry, and the zeroth LL and
ﬁrst LL of the original Dirac point are completely de-
generate in both valleys (discussed in Section III C). For
the sublattice-asymmetric potential, u0,1,3 = {0, 0, 0.15}
(lower panel), the bands at zero magnetic ﬁeld are sym-
metric under the operation which combines electron-hole-
reﬂection and a rotation by π/3, which is reﬂected in the
electron-hole symmetry of the magnetic miniband widths
in a magnetic ﬁeld. Additionally for this perturbation, we
ﬁnd that the magnetic miniband structure around  = 0
can form gapless linear or quadratic Dirac points, which
produce sequences of LLs in the magnetic miniband spec-
trum, best visible around φ/φ0 = 2 in the K(cid:48)-valley and
φ/φ0 = 1 in the K-valley (also see Section III C).

C. Eﬀective model of low energy features in the

magnetic minibands

The main features of the broadened magnetic mini-
band spectrum around zero energy at a simple fraction
φ/φ0 = 1/q can be described by truncating the basis of
Bloch functions Eq. (7) to the zeroth and ﬁrst LL only,
yielding eﬀective Hamiltonians,

the ﬁgure. The computed dispersion surfaces display a
wide array of possible forms, including the possibility of
gapless linear or quadratic Dirac points for the super-
lattice perturbation ui=0,1,3 = {0, 0, 0.15}vb. These fea-
tures are found either in the K(cid:48)-valley whenever p in
φ/φ0 = p/q is even (Fig. 2C), or in the K-valley when-
ever p in φ/φ0 = p/q is odd (Fig. 2D).
For the perturbation with ui=0,1,3 = {0, 0.15, 0}vb
two zero-energy LLs of Hamiltonian (2) remain unper-
turbed (lower middle panel
in Fig. 1), which is re-
ﬂected in the fact that all matrix elements in Hamil-
tonians (8)-(9) vanish.
In this case, Hamiltonian
(2) obeys the “electron-hole” symmetry σz ˜Hξσz =
− ˜Hξ, which implies that its matrix elements must
obey (cid:104)nα
(k)(cid:105). Con-
sequently, the resulting Heisenberg matrix has at least
2p + 1 linearly dependent rows, resulting in zero-energy
eigenvalues which are 2p-fold degenerate. As the u1 only
perturbation can be considered to be a periodic pseudo-
magnetic ﬁeld [10], it could alternatively be created using
an Abrikosov lattice, i.e., a vortex structure generated
from a type-II superconductor in a magnetic ﬁeld. Such
a system is also expected to possess degenerate zero en-

D. Eﬀective models for the secondary Dirac points

FIG. 3:
The Landau level spectra of the valence band
secondary Dirac point (sDP) the perturbation u0,1,3 =
{0.032,−0.063,−0.055},
obtained from either Hamilto-
nian (12) for the κ(cid:48) and κ corners (red and blue dots) or
Hamiltonian (2) (black dots). The grey solid lines are the
Landau levels of the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (13), using
ﬁtted parameters E0 = −0.22vb, ∆κ = −0.0057vb, ˜v = 0.38v,
¯M = −0.97ev/b, and ˜M = −1.45ev/b.

Here we give an analytical description of the almost
gapless sDP found at the corner superlattice Brillouin
zone in the valence band in the top row of Fig. 1. To do
this, we note that zone folding using Bragg vectors bm
brings together three degenerate plane wave states |ζκ(cid:105),
|ζ(κ + b2)(cid:105) and |ζ(κ + b1)(cid:105)to each of the two inequivalent

Figure 3 shows the LL spectra of Hamiltonian (12) us-
ing blue(red) dots for the −κ(κ) corner, where the signa-
ture of an almost gapless sDP is evident at  ≈ −0.22 vb
for the −κ corner. To calculate this spectra, we diagonal-
ized the Heisenberg matrix of Hamiltonian (12) in a basis
consisting of the products of magnetic oscillator functions
(4) with the standing waves states (11), ϕn(k2)Φi, where
we take i = 1, 2, 3, and n = 0··· nmax, where is nmax
suﬃciently large that the resulting spectrum converges.
Any eigenstates with a large weight on high-index mag-
netic oscillator functions, ϕn(k2) with n (cid:38) (bλB)2, are
discarded because they violate the k · p approximation
used to construct Hamiltonian (12). Also, to improve
the comparison of its LL spectra with that of Hamilto-
nian (2), we calculate the moir´e perturbation correction

to the band-edge energies, 1,2,3, using a higher order of
perturbation theory than is explicit in Eq. (12).

The result of numerical diagonalization of the two band
Hamiltonian (2) is displayed using black dots in Fig. 3.
The two spectra agree well, conﬁrming that Eq. (12) is
a good description of the sDP. Moreover, we can diag-
onalize Hamiltonian (12) for arbitrarily small magnetic
ﬁelds, where the size of the Heisenberg matrix of mag-
netic Bloch functions (7) needed to diagonalize Hamilto-
nian (2) becomes prohibitively large.

The energy of the“zeroth” LL originating from the sDP
in Fig. 3 depends on the magnetic ﬁeld, due to a non-
zero magnetic momentum generated from the inﬂuence
of a third band (residing mainly on Φ3 for Hamiltonian
(12)) that mixes with the LLs of the ﬁrst two bands. For
the parameter set u0,1,3 = {0.032,−0.063,−0.055}, this
third band is separated by a large gap from the sDP,
which permits the approximate two band description for
the sDP,

where the parameters for the energy shift E0, gap ∆κ,
eﬀective velocity ˜v, and magnetic momentums M and
˜M can be ﬁtted to the result of numerically diagonaliz-
ing Eq. (2). Such a ﬁtting is illustrated in Fig. 3 using
the grey lines, and produces the best accuracy for low
indexed LLs.

IV. MAGNETIC MINIBAND SPECTRUM AND
COMPRESSIBILITY OF 2D ELECTRON LIQUID

IN BLG-HBN HETEROSTRUCTURES

Fig. 4 shows the maps of incompressible states for each
parameter set in Fig. 1, created by ﬁlling the correspond-
ing magnetic miniband spectrum with electrons. A larger
gap is depicted with a darker color, resulting in lines, the
gradient of which corresponds to the ﬁlling factor. For
the regions shown in yellow, the gap is negligibly small
as a result of incomplete ﬁlling of a magnetic miniband,
each of which can accommodate a density δρ = 1/(πpλ2
B)
of electrons (including spin degeneracy). In contrast, the
unperturbed zero-energy Landau level present in the K(cid:48)
valley accommodates electron density of δρ0 = 1/(πλ2
B),
creating a large gapless region portrayed in red. Because
of its large electron capacity at exactly zero energy, the
presence of this zero-energy mode should be clearly visi-
ble in capacitance measurements. Electron-hole symme-
try is displayed in the plots for u0,1,3 = {0, 0.15, 0} (lower
left), and u0,1,3 = {0, 0, 0.15} (lower right), whereas it is
absent in the upper two plots.

Many of the largest gaps in the magnetic spectrum
plots (Fig. 1) occur between the zeroth and ﬁrst LLs of
Dirac points (whether original or secondary). In the map
of incompressible states, these large gaps are manifest as
a solid blue line, which intersect the B = 0 axis at a
density ρS = 4m, where m = 0 for the main Dirac point

FIG. 4: Density-magnetic ﬁeld diagram showing incompress-
ible electron states in the magnetic minibands, calculated for
the same parameters as Fig. 1. Larger gaps are shown us-
ing a darker color, yellow represents a vanishing gap, and red
represents the particular gapless states associated with the
zero-energy Landau level.

or m = ±1 for an sDP at the edge of the ﬁrst conduc-
tion/valence miniband. For example, there is a (gapped)
sDP in the valence band of the magnetic spectrum for the
moir´e perturbation u0,1,3 = {0.032,−0.063,−0.055} (up-
per panel in Fig. 1). In the upper panel of Fig. 4, the gap
between the two zeroth LLs of this sDP is represented as
a blue vertical line, which starts from (ρS = −4, B = 0),
whereas the two gaps between the zeroth and ﬁrst LLs
are shown as two tilted blue lines, with gradients of ±2.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have shown that the presence of
the hBN substrate lifts the valley degeneracy of bilayer
graphene, producing diﬀerent magnetic Hofstadter’s but-
terﬂies in each valley. The zero-energy Landau level lo-
cated on the layer furthest from the hBN substrate re-
mains unaﬀected by the moir´e perturbation, which makes
the BLG/hBN spectrum unique in comparison to other
known magnetic spectra, for which all Landau levels split
into sub-bands. We investigated the inﬂuence of dif-
ferent possible characteristics of moir´e perturbation in-
cluding an electrostatic potential which does not distin-
guish between the two carbon sublattices, a sublattice-
asymmetric part of the potential, and a spatial modula-
tion of the nearest-neighbor carbon-carbon hopping am-
plitude, and we identiﬁed how they give rise to diﬀer-
ent features in the electronic spectra including gapped or
overlapping bands, or bands connected by a secondary

8

Dirac point. In addition to determining the fractal elec-
tronic spectra by numerical diagonalization of a model
Hamiltonian, we also derived simple eﬀective Hamiltoni-
ans to describe low-energy features in the magnetic mini-
bands and to describe the secondary Dirac point. Finally,
we showed how gaps in the fractal energy spectrum lead
to the formation of incompressible states that may be ob-
served under a variation of carrier density and magnetic
ﬁeld.
