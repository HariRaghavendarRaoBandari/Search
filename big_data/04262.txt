On the basis of the Usadel equation we study a multi-terminal Josephson junction. This junction is com-
posed by “magnetic” superconductors Sm which have singlet pairing and are separated from the normal
n wire by spin ﬁlters so that the Josephson coupling is caused only by fully polarized triplet components. We
show that there is no interaction between triplet Cooper pairs with antiparallel total spin orientations. The
presence of an additional singlet superconductor S attached to the n wire leads to a ﬁnite Josephson cur-
rent IQ with an unusual current–phase relation. The density of states in the n wire for different orientations
of spins of Cooper pairs is calculated. We derive a general formula for the current IQ in a multi-terminal
Josephson contact and apply this formula for analysis of two four-terminal Josephson junctions of different
structures. It is shown in particular that both the “nematic” and the “magnetic” cases can be realized in
these junctions. In a two-terminal structure with parallel ﬁlter orientations and in a three-terminal struc-
ture with antiparallel ﬁlter orientations of the “magnetic” superconductors with attached additional singlet
superconductor, we ﬁnd a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the critical current. Also, in these
structures, the critical current shows a Riedel peak like dependence on the exchange ﬁeld in the “magnetic”
superconductors. Although there is no current through the S/n interface due to orthogonality of the sin-
glet and triplet components, the phase of the order parameter in the superconuctor S is shown to affect the
Josephson current in a multi-terminal structure.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, there has been an increasing in-
terest in studying the Josephson effect in Josephson junc-
tions (JJ) of different types.
Interesting effects have been
observed in JJs consisting of superconductors (S) and fer-
romagnetic layers (F). The authors of Refs. 1 and 2 have
predicted long ago that in JJs of the S/F/S type, the criti-
cal current Ic may change sign and the so-called π-state can
be realized. However, only recently the sign reversal of Ic
has been observed experimentally.3–9 The unusual state in
S/F/S JJs is caused by the action of an exchange ﬁeld h in F
on spins of Cooper pairs penetrating into the ferromagnet F
from the singlet superconductors due to the proximity ef-
fect. This action leads to spatial oscillations of the wave
function of Cooper pairs f and consequently to the sign
change of Ic. Combination of π- and 0-Josephson contacts
allows one to construct a so-called φ-contact, that is, the
junctions with a ﬁnite arbitrary phase difference φ in the
ground state.10–12 Such JJs have a high potential for appli-
cations, for example, in realization of the so-called Q-bits.13
Another interesting effect occurs in multilayered S/F JJs
if the magnetization vectors M in different F layers are not
collinear or the magnetization in the ferromagnet F is not
uniform (helical ferromagnet or ferromagnet with a do-
main wall).14–16 In this case, triplet Cooper pairs arise in the
S/F system with the total spin S parallel to M in an F layer
which is almost “transparent” for these pairs. Even if this
ferromagnet is strong, the penetration depth can reach a
pD/T (in diffusive case) in con-
large value of the order ξ ≃
pD/h for singlet
trast to a short penetration length ξh ≃
Cooper pairs or for the triplet ones with the total spin S per-

pendicular to the vectors M (only such Cooper pairs arise
in the case of uniform magnetization). The triplet Cooper
pairs with S ∥ M can be called the long-range triplet compo-
nent (LRTC). The Josephson effect caused by the LRTC has
been observed in many experiments on S/F JJs with non-
homogeneous M in ferromagnetic layer(s)17–26 and exten-
sively studied in theoretical works, see, e.g., Refs. 27–34 and
many other papers cited in reviews Refs. 15 and 35, and es-
pecially in Ref. 36. Spin non-dissipative current also arises
in such JJs, and therefore these structures with the triplet
spin-polarised component may be used in superconduct-
ing spintronics.35,36 A special attention is paid nowadays to
the study of spin-orbit interaction in S/F structures which is
necessary for achieving so-called Majorana states.37–39

Many works are related with strong efforts to detect these
exotic quasiparticles—the so-called Majorana fremions—
in condensed matter with the help of Josephson junctions
as the latter represent a sensitive and convenient tool to
achieve this goal. These particles, which are identical to
their antiparticles, were predicted long ago,40 but only rel-
atively recently it has been shown that they can exist in con-
densed matter.41 In particular, the Josephson coupling may
be realized through the Majorana fermions leading to the
so-called fractional Josephson effect, i.e., the Josephson cur-
rent IJ is related to the phase difference ϕ as (see Refs. 42–45)

Although some indications on the existence of the Majorana

fermions have been obtained in experiments,47–51 further
work is needed to make decisive conclusions.

In this case, the phase relation of the Josephson current is
rather unusual,66

In principle, the current-phase relation can be more com-
plicated in different types of JJs and contain many higher

harmonics, IJ ∝ Pn≥0 In sin[(2n + 1)ϕ].52,53

Interesting physics and new possibilities for application
occur in multi-terminal S/n or S/F structures. Additional
terminals in the JJs allow one to control and to tune the
critical Josephson current. For example, a sign-reversal
of the Josephson critical current has been observed in
multi-terminal S/n/S JJs with two additional lateral nor-
mal terminals54 when voltage was applied to these nor-
mal terminals. Theoretically, this nonequilibrium effect
has been predicted and studied in Refs. 55–57. An in-
verse effect—a modulation of the conductance between
normal reservoirs in the presence of the phase difference
between superconductors—has been observed earlier by
Petrashov et. al.58,59

Four-terminal JJs with all superconducting reservoirs
have been studied in Refs. 60–64. The Josephson cou-
pling between different superconductors has been provided
through the n or F wires connecting the reservoirs. It has
been shown that the critical current Ic may be tuned by
varying the phase difference between lateral superconduct-
ing reservoirs. The case of two short F wires connecting the
superconductors has been studied in Ref. 63. The length
of the F wires has been supposed to be shorter than ξh so
that the singlet component penetrated into the F wires due
to the proximity effect. Since the magnetisations in crossed
wires have been assumed to be perpendicular to each other,
not only singlet component but also the LRTC existed in
the ferromagnetic wires. The Josephson effect arose due to
a complicated interaction between the LRTC with spin-up
and spin-down Cooper pairs and the singlet one.

In our recent works,65,66 we studied the Josephson effect
in two- and three-terminal Sm/Im/n Josephson contacts in
which superconducting reservoirs Sm represent “magnetic”
superconductors separated from the normal n wire by a
spin ﬁlter Im.
[In experiment, the spin ﬁlter may be re-
alized by a magnetic insulator or half metal which lets to
pass triplet Cooper pairs with only a certain orientation of
the total spin S.]
Investigating the Josephson junction of
the types Sm/Im/n/Im/Sm and Sm/F/n/F/Sm (where F rep-
resents a strong ferromagnet) we showed that there is a
great difference between them.65 The second type of JJs can
be called nematic as the strong ferromagnet F passes the
triplet Cooper pairs with spin-up and spin-down orienta-
tion (the ﬁlter axes are oriented along the z-axis), while the
ﬁrst one is denoted as “magnetic” type since the direction
of the vector S is determined by the orientation of the ﬁl-
ter axes h.
In particular, if the h vectors are antiparallel
to each other, there is no Josephson coupling between the
right and left superconductors Sm and the Josephson cur-
rent is zero, IJ = 0.
If an additional terminal in the form
of a singlet superconductor is attached to the n wire in the
Sm/Im/n/Im/Sm contact, the Josephson current can ﬂow be-
tween the S and the Sm reservoirs, while in the absence of
any of the three terminals there is no Josephson current.

IJ = Ic sin(2ϕ) ,

(3)

where ϕ = (χR + χL)/2− χS, and χR(L), χS are the phases of
the right (left) “triplet” Sm superconductors and the singlet
superconductor, respectively.

One visualizes the case of the Josephson coupling via Ma-
jorana fermions as “fusion” of a pair of Majorana fermions.
In case of two Sm superconductors and one singlet super-
conductor, we have a transformation of two singlet Cooper
pairs into two triplet Cooper pairs with antiparallel to-
tal spins S (a supersinglet) which are transferred to the
right (left) superconductor Sm. Thus, different number of
Cooper pairs participate in the Josephson coupling—one
half in the Majorana case, Eq. (1), one Cooper pair in the
conventional Josephson effect, Eq. (2), or two Cooper pairs
in the case considered in Ref. 66 with the current-phase re-
lation Eq. (3).

The Josephson effect in the latter case can be seen as
an extension of the family of n-fermion condensate caused
Josephson effect with according adaptation of the phase de-
pendence with the sequence given by Eqs. (1), (2) and (3),
i.e., the phase dependence is represented by sin(nϕ/2), re-
spectively.

In this Paper, we consider generic multi-terminal Joseph-
son junctions consisting of only Sm superconductors [see
Fig. 1 (a)], or of Sm superconductors plus a singlet super-
conductor [see Fig. 1 (b)]. The ﬁrst system allows one
to study interaction of fully polarized triplet components,
while in the second one we can obtain both—the nematic
case with the conventional Josephson relation IQ (ϕ), Eq. (2),
and also the magnetic case with unusual current-phase re-
lation IQ(ϕ), Eq. (3). We show, in particular, that the triplet
components with opposite spin direction created by the left
and right superconductors SmL and SmR do not interfere in
SmL/n/SmR or in SmL/F/SmR JJs at any interface transparen-
cies.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we de-
scribe the system under consideration and present basic
equations. In Section III, the simplest two-terminal system
of the Sm/n/Sm or Sm/I/Sm type will be studied, where Sm
is a “magnetic” superconductor separated from the normal
wire n by a spin-ﬁlter. The Sm/I/Sm contact is a tunnel junc-
tion with a thin insulating layer I. A general formula for the
Josephson current IQ in a multi-terminal Josephson junc-
tion in the limit of a high Sm/n interface resistance will be
presented in Section IV. We use this formula in Section IV A
to brieﬂy describe the Josephson effect in a four-terminal
contact consisting only of Sm superconductors (that is, only
fully polarized triplet components exist in the n wire). The
more interesting case of a four-terminal junction with one
singlet superconductor and three Sm superconductors hav-
ing different orientations of the h vectors is considered in
Section IV B where the expression for the current is obtained
based on the derivation of the general expressions. In Con-
clusions, we summarize and discuss the obtained results.

tool

The convenient

to describe the system under
consideration is the method of quasiclassical Green’s
functions.70–73 This technique has been widely used for
studying mesoscopic multi-terminal S/n structures.74–79 In
the considered diffusive case, these functions obey the Us-
adel equation,80 which in the n wire has the form

−∇( ˆg∇ ˆg )+

1

2

κ2
ω[ ˆX30 , ˆg ] = 0,

(4)

where κ2
ω = ω/D with the diffusion coefﬁcient D, and
ω = (2n + 1)πT is the Matsubara frequency. In the consid-
ered case of the exchange ﬁeld acting on the spins of elec-
trons, the Green’s function ˆg is a 4× 4 matrix in the particle-
hole and spin spaces. The matrix ˆXi j = ˆτi · ˆσ j
is a ten-
sor product of the Pauli matrices ˆτi and ˆσ j (i , j = 0, 1, 2, 3)
which operate correspondingly in the particle-hole and spin
space, respectively, and the 0-th Pauli matrix is just the unity
2× 2 matrix. Moreover, the matrix quasiclassical Green’s
function ˆg obeys the normalization condition

ˆg · ˆg = 1.

(5)

As in our previous works,65,66 we use a representation
for the matrix Green’s functions ˆg suggested by Ivanov and
Fominov.81 These Green’s functions are related to those in
Refs. 14 and 15, ˆgBVE, via the transformation ˆg = U · ˆgBVE ·U †
with U = (1/2)(1+ i ˆX33)· (1− i ˆX03).
Equation (4) is complemented by boundary conditions
at the interfaces Sm/n and S/n. They have the form [see
Refs. 82, and 83, as well as Eq. (4.7) in Ref. 84]

Lν ˆg ∂ν ˆg|ν=±Lν = ±rν[ ˆg , ˆΓν ˆGν ˆΓν]|ν=±Lν ,

(6)

where rν = Lν/p2σRb,ν, with the conductivity of
the
n wire σ and the n-Sm interface resistance at Lν per unit
area Rb,ν. The matrix coefﬁcient ˆΓ describes the electron
transmission with a spin-dependent probability T↑,↓. If the
ﬁlters let to pass only electrons with spins aligned paral-
lel to the z axis, then ˆΓ = T ˆ1+ U ˆX33 so that the probabil-
ity for an electron with spin up (down) to penetrate into
the n wire is T↑,↓ ∝ T ± U . We assume that U = ζT with
ζ = ±1, and that the coefﬁcients T and U are normalized,
p2. The S/n interface between the conventional
T = |U | =
superconductor and the normal metal were is assumed to
be spin independent so that ˆΓ = ˆ1 and rS = L/σRS.
We have to ﬁnd a solution of Eq. (4) taking into account
the normalization and boundary conditions Eqs. (5) and (6).
This can be easily done in the case of a short normal wire,
pD/T holds. Then, integrat-
i.e., when the condition L ≪
ing Eq. (4) over the coordinate along the normal wire with
account for the boundary conditions yields the equation

[ ˆΛ , ˆg ] = 0,

(7)

where the matrix ˆΛ = ˆΛn + ˆΛm is a sum of contributions of
the normal wire and Sm superconductors, ˆΛn = rω ˆX30 with
rω = ωL2/D. The matrix

ˆΛm = Xν

II. MODEL AND BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a multi-terminal Josephson junction (JJ)
which consists of “magnetic” superconductors with or with-
out one conventional singlet BCS superconductor (see
Fig. 1). All superconductors are connected by a normal
n wire or ﬁlm. The “magnetic” superconductors are formed
by a conventional superconductor covered by a thin ferro-
magnetic layer F with an exchange ﬁeld h. Due to the prox-
imity effect the singlet component penetrates from the su-
perconductor into the F ﬁlm, and also a triplet component
arises under the action of the exchange ﬁeld h. As is well
known (see, e.g., reviews Refs. 15, 16, and 36), in the case of
homogeneous magnetization M (with M ∥ h), the vector of
the total spin of triplet Cooper pairs S lies in the plane per-
pendicular to M. Thus, in case of a good contact between
the S and F layers, the S/F bilayer can be considered as a
“magnetic” superconductor with a built-in exchange ﬁeld h
that has the amplitude heff = |h|dF/(dF + dS) and a nonzero
projection onto the z axis, where dF(S) are the thicknesses
of the F and S layers, respectively.67 The F layer is separated
from the n wire (or ﬁlm) by a ﬁlter that passes electrons only
with a certain spin direction, say, parallel or antiparallel to
the z axis (ﬁlter axis). As a ﬁlter, one can use thin layers
of strongly polarized magnetic insulator, for example EuO68
and DyN or GdN ﬁlms.69

is related to the Green’s functions in the ν-th “magnetic”
superconductor ˆGm via ˆΛν = rν[ ˆΓ· ˆGm · ˆΓ]ν, or in the sin-
glet superconductor via ˆΛS = rS ˆGS.
The Green’s func-
tion ˆGν ≡ [ ˆΓ· ˆGm · ˆΓ]ν in the Sm superconductors have the
form65,66

ˆGν = g+

ˆX30 + g−

ˆX33 + ˆFν ,

(9)

where the condensate Green’s function in the “magnetic”
superconductor ˆFν with the phase χν is deﬁned as

ˆFν = f− exp[i χν ˆX30]· ˆXν ,

where

(10)

(11)

(12)

f± = [ f (ω+ i h)± f (ω− i h)]/2,
g± = [g (ω+ i h)± g (ω− i h)]/2,

with f (ω) = (∆/ω)· g (ω) = ∆/pω2 + ∆2. The form of the

ˆXν depends on the chirality of

matrices
the triplet
component66 and on the direction of the ﬁlter axes, i.e., on
the sign of ζ. In the case of the x- or y-chirality (i.e., the
vector h is directed along the x- or y-axis, respectively) this
matrices have the form

ˆXx (ζ) = ˆX11 − ζ ˆX22 ,
ˆX y (ζ) = ˆX12 + ζ ˆX21 .

(13)

(14)

In the case of the x-chirality, the ﬁlter lets to pass Cooper
pairs with spin up if ζ = +1 and the Sm/n interface is trans-
parent only for the Cooper pairs with spin down if ζ = −1,
and vice versa for the y-chirality. One can show that
terms given by ˆXx (+1) describe correlators of the form
∝ 〈 ˆc↑ ˆc↑(t )〉 while those given by ˆXx (−1)—correlators of the
form ∝ 〈 ˆc↓ ˆc↓(t )〉; correspondingly, describe the terms given
by ˆX y (−1) correlators of the form ∝ 〈 ˆc↑ ˆc↑(t )〉 while those
given by ˆX y (+1)—correlators of the form ∝ 〈 ˆc↓ ˆc↓(t )〉.
in the n wire
(here, ˆgd and ˆf are diagonal and, respectively, off-diagonal
in the Gor’kov-Nambu space parts of ˆg ), one can easily ﬁnd
the Josephson charge IQ current at the interface of the ν-th
terminal, which is given by the expression

Knowing the Green’s function ˆg ≡ ˆgd + ˆf

IQ|ν = i arν(2πT )Xω

Tr{ ˆX30 · [ ˆf , ˆFν]} ,

(15)

where a = σ/(16eL), and σ is the conductivity of the n wire.
To begin with, we consider the simplest case of a two-
terminal Josephson junction,
i.e., the Sm/n/Sm contact
schematically sketched in Fig. 2.

III. TWO-TERMINAL JOSEPHSON CONTACT

FIG. 2.
(Color online.) Schematic representation of a simple
Sm/n/Sm Josephson junction. The ﬁlters Fl, denoted by blue layers
attached to the n wire, can be oriented parallel (ζR = ζL) or antipar-
allel (ζR = −ζL).

rR = rL ≡ rm ≪ 1). There, it has been shown that the Joseph-
son current is zero in case of antiparallel (ζR = −ζL) and is
ﬁnite in JJs with parallel (ζR = ζL) ﬁlter axes orientations.
Here, we show that in case of a short normal wire or a thin
pD/πT ), this statement remains valid for
n ﬁlm (L ≪ ξT =
arbitrary transmittance coefﬁcient rm.
In addition to the
Josephson current, we calculate also the density of states
(DOS) in the n wire for parallel (ζR = ζL) and antiparallel
(ζR = −ζL) ﬁlter axes orientations.
We need to solve Eq. (7), where the matrix ˆΛ = ˆΛn + ˆΛm
is a sum of two matrices, ˆΛn and ˆΛm = ˆΛL + ˆΛR. The matri-
ces ˆΛR(L) at the right (left) Sm/n interfaces are related to the
Green’s functions ˆGm in “magnetic” superconductors as

ˆΛn = 2rω ˆX30 ,

ˆΛR(L) = rm[ ˆΓ· ˆGm · ˆΓ]R(L) .

(16)

(17)

The Green’s function ˆGm ≡ ˆRπ/2,2 · ˆGm · ˆR†

π/2,2 in the Sm
superconductor is related to the Green’s function ˆGm in
a superconductor with a uniform exchange ﬁeld h ori-
ented along the z-axis by means of the rotation ma-
trix ˆRπ/2,2 = cos(π/4)+ i ˆX02 sin(π/4).
The form of the
rotation matrix means that we assume for deﬁnite-
ness the x-chirality for the triplet component in both
Sm superconductors.66 Thus, we ﬁnd for ˆΛR(L)

ˆΛR(L) = rR(L)[g+( ˆX30 + ζR(L) ˆX03)+ f− exp(i χR(L) ˆX30)· ˆXR(L)] ,
(18)
where ˆXR(L) is one of the matrices deﬁned in Eqs. (13)
and (14), depending on the chirality of the triplet compo-
nents generated by the the right, respectively, left Sm super-
conductor. The ﬁnal results do not depend on the type of
chiralitiy and, thus, we assume them to be equal.

A.

Josephson current in Sm/Fl/n/Fl/Sm junctions

Knowing the matrix ˆg , we can ﬁnd the density of

states ν(ε) in the normal wire wire,

The dc Josephson effect in this system has been con-
sidered in our previous work65 under assumption of a
small transparency of the right (left) Sm/n interfaces,

ν(ε) = ℜ¡Tr{ ˆX30 ˆg }|ω=−i ε¢

and the Josephson current IQ in the system,

IQ = i a(1/4)(2πT ) Xω=0
= i a(1/4)(2πT ) Xω=0

Tr{ ˆX30[ ˆg , ˆgR]}

(20)

Tr{ ˆX30[ ˆf , ˆfR]} ,

where ˆgR(L) = ˆg (±Lx ) are the Green’s functions at the right
(left) Sm/n interface while ˆf and ˆfR are the condensate
(off-diagonal in the particle-hole space) parts of the Green’s
functions in the n wire and in the right Sm, respectively.

Equation (7) can be solved for an Sm/n/Sm Josephson
junction in a general case, but we present here simple an-
alytical results for some particular cases. The details of the
derivation in each case are provided in the Appendix A.

a. Antiparallel ﬁlter orientation (ζR = −ζL ≡ ζ). The

density of states is calculated from Eqs. (19) and (A3),

ν(ε) = ℜ£(1+ γ2

|ω=−i ε¤ ,

(21)

with γa deﬁned in Eq. (A4). In this case of antiparallel ﬁlter
orientation, the DOS does not depend on the phase differ-
ence ϕ = χR − χL. In Fig. 3, we plot the energy dependence
of the DOS for both the conﬁgurations of the ﬁlters.
In the considered system with antiparallel spin ﬁlter axes
the Josephson current is zero at any transparencies of the
Sm/n interfaces,

IQ = 0.

(22)

b. Parallel ﬁlter orientation (ζR = ζL ≡ ζ). The density

of states, Eq. (19), in this case is given by

One can see that the phase dependence of Ic leads to ap-
pearance of higher harmonics in the Josephson current, i.e.,
the current IQ in Eq. (24) can be written as

In Fig. 3, we plot the energy dependence of the DOS for
both the conﬁgurations of the ﬁlters, i.e., parallel [panels (a),
(c), and (e)] and antiparallel [panels (b) and (d)]. The top
row displays the DOS for different values of h = |h|. Ad-
ditional parameters ϕ and rm are ﬁxed. In both the cases
the peaks are located at ε = |∆0 ± h|. The middle row shows
the DOS for different values of rm with ﬁxed ϕ and h. The
bottom row shows the DOS for different values of ϕ in the

The top row displays the DOS for different values of h = |h|,
i.e., h = 0 (black dotted line); h = 0.5∆0 (green long-dashed line);
h = 1.0∆0 (black solid line); h = 1.8∆0 (blue short-dashed line).
Additional parameters are cos ϕ = 1.0 and rm = 0.25. In both the
cases the peaks are located at ε = |∆0 ± h|. The middle row shows
the DOS for different values of rm, i.e., rm = 0.1 (red solid line);
rm = 0.5 (black dashed line); rm = 1.0 (green dash-dotted line); the
black dotted line indicates ν = 1. Here, cos ϕ = 1.0 and h = 0.5∆0.
The bottom row shows the DOS for different values of cosϕ = 1.0 in
the case of parallel orientation of ﬁlters, i.e., cos ϕ = 0 (black dotted

cos ϕ = 1.0 (blue dash-dotted line). Here, h = 0.5∆0 and rm = 0.25.
In the case of antiparallel ﬁlter orientation, there is no dependence
of DOS on ϕ.

In the case of antiparallel ﬁlter orientation, there is no de-
pendence of DOS on ϕ. Observe that the dependence ν(ε)
is similar for parallel and antiparallel ﬁlter orientations—
excluding the dependence of the amplitude of DOS on the
phase which is there for the parallel case, but absent in the

6

rents in the considered systems with that in a conventional
Josephson junction of the S/n/S type, we now present the
DOS and the critical current for such a junction. Again, the
details of the derivation are provided in the Appendix A.

The coefﬁcient a is the same as in Eq. (25) and related with
the critical current Ic via Eq. (28).

As concerns the temperature and h dependence of the
critical current Ic for the parallel ﬁlter axes given by Eq. (28),
we see that the temperature dependence is not monotonous
and has a maximum at a temperature below Tc. Similar
dependencies have been obtained for a ballistic Josephson
junction with spin-active interfaces.27,36 This maximum has
been interpreted as a contribution of the Andreev bound
states to the Josephson current. In our diffusive case there
are no Andreev bound states, so this explanation is not uni-
versal. In our system, it is related to a singularity in the DOS
and in the Green’s functions at h = ∆. This singularity re-
sembles the Riedel singularity on the I -V characteristics if
a voltage V is applied to a junction.85 To some extent, from
the mathematical point of view, the voltage V is analogous
to the exchange ﬁeld h. The form of the I -V curve for an
S/F/S Josephson contact has been found in Ref. 86.

In order to make the nature of the maximum in the
Ic(T ) dependence more clear, we present in the next sub-
section the critical current for different tunnel JJs with
“magnetic” superconductors with and without spin ﬁlters.

B.

Josephson current in tunnel Sm/Fl/I/Fl/Sm junctions

As has been found earlier, a singular behavior of the
Green’s functions in Sm/I/Sm junctions with antiparallel
orientations of the h vectors leads to an enhancement of
the critical Josephson current.67 The Josephson current in
Sm/I/Sm JJs is given again by Eq. (20) with ˆf = ˆfL and

ˆfL(R) = exp(i χL(R) ˆX30)[ f+

Josephson contact with antiparallel ﬁlter directions, IQ = 0, see
Eq. (22). Top panels show the temperature dependence of Ic for
different values of h = |h|, i.e., h = 1.5∆0 (blue dash-dotted line);
h = 1.0∆0 (red solid line); h = 0.5∆0 (black dashed line). Notice-
ably, at h < ∆0, the temperature dependence of Ic is nonmono-
tonic and has a maximum at some temperature. The bottom pan-
els display the dependence of Ic on h at T = 0 resembling the
Riedel peak.85 Other parameters are cos ϕ = 1.0 and rm = 0.25.

Thus, in order to experimentally distinguish the both
cases, it is safer to rely on measurements of the Joseph-
son critical current displayed in Fig. 4 in the left column,
[panels (a) and (c), from Eq.(25)], for parallel ﬁlter conﬁg-
uration. In the case of antiparallel ﬁlter orientation, IQ = 0,
see Eq. (22). We compare the dependence of the Josephson
critical current with the case of a so-called TST-contact with
T denoting the “magnetic” superconductor with ﬁlters ori-
ented antiparallel and S is an additional singlet supercon-
ducting reservoir attached to the normal wire.66 Top pan-
els show the temperature dependence of Ic for different val-
ues of h with ﬁxed ϕ and rm. Noticeably, at h < ∆0, the
temperature dependence of Ic is nonmonotonic and has a
maximum at some temperature. The bottom panels display
the dependence of Ic on h at T = 0 resembling the Riedel
peak,85 but in our case, the role of the voltage V is played by
the exchange ﬁeld h in the weak ferromagnet Fw responsi-
ble for creation of the triplet component. Also, the location
of the peak is given by h = ∆ in contrast to V = 2∆ as it is the
case in the Riedel singularity.85

In order to facilitate the comparison of the critical cur-

The critical current Ic,m↑↑ in Eq. (35) in an Sm/Fl/I/Fl/Sm
contact with parallel ﬁlter axes has a peak as a function of h
and, contrary to Ic↑↑(h) and Ic↑↓(h), has a maximum in the
temperature dependence. This behavior is similar to the
case illustrated in Figs. 4 (a) and 4 (c) for the critical Joseph-
son current Ic in an Sm/Fl/n/Fl/Sm contact, see Eq. (25).

IV. CHARGE CURRENTS IN MULTI-TERMINAL SYSTEMS

In this section, we consider a multi-terminal Josephson
junction of a type shown in Fig. 1 and calculate the charge
currents through n different Sm/n interfaces assuming coef-
ﬁcients rn as small parameters. We consider a system with
many Sm superconductors and with one singlet supercon-
ductor S, which is coupled to the n wire via the coefﬁcient rS .
The transmittance of the S/n interface can be arbitrary, i.e.,
the coefﬁcient rS varies from 0 (no coupling) to ∞ (perfect
S/n interface). In this case, the solution of Eq. (7) is given by

δ ˆf =

where E = q ˜G 2

the phase of the singlet superconductor, and the func-
tions ˜GS and FS are deﬁned in Eq. (A17).

Using Eqs. (18) and (37), we ﬁnd the correction to the con-
densate Green’s function in the n wire due to the presence of
“magnetic” superconductors Sm given by the matrix ˆΛm,

(33)

(34)

where D(ω) = (ζ+Rζ−R)(ζ+Lζ−L). Both critical currents, Ic↑↑
and Ic↑↓, occur due to tunneling of singlet and triplet com-
ponents.

We present here also the expression for the critical cur-
rent in a Sm/Fl/I/Fl/Sm contact, where Sm/Fl is a “mag-
netic” superconductor Sm with a spin ﬁlter Fl. Then, the
Josephson current us caused only by tunneling of triplet
Cooper pairs.

Cooper pairs with the total spin parallel to the x axis

rent is

Ic,m↑↑ ∝ −(2πT ) Xω≥0ℑ¡ζ+R¢ℑ¡ζ+L¢±D(ω) .

(35)

In case of antiparallel ﬁlter axes, we again have

Ic,m↑↓ = 0.

(36)

The critical current Ic↑↑(h) has no peak as a function
of h, while at low temperatures the critical current Ic↑↓(h),
Eq. (34), has a sharp peak similar to the one shown in
Fig. 4 (c). Both currents, Ic↑↑ and Ic↑↓ decay monotonously
with increasing temperature.

Using Eqs. (39)–(41) one can easily calculate the cur-
rents IQ|n and Inn′ . The expressions for Inn′ have different
forms depending on whether the matrices ˆXn and ˆXn′ cor-
respond to different or equal chiralities.66 We assume that
the n-th terminal corresponds to the x-chirality, ˆXn = ˆXx
[see Eq.(13)]. Then, for equal chiralities ( ˆXn = ˆXn′ ) we ob-

ϕnn′ = χn − χn′ .
If the triplet components at the n-th and n′-th termi-
nals correspond to different chiralities, e.g., ˆXn = ˆXx and
ˆXn′ = ˆX y [see Eq.(14)], we ﬁnd

bitrary multi-terminal structure with “magnetic” supercon-

, Eqs. (42) and (43).

Now, we discuss general properties of the partial cur-
rents I xx
In the absence of
the singlet superconductor S (in which case B = 0) only the
ﬁrst terms in Eqs. (42) and (43) are ﬁnite. These terms turn
to zero in the case of antiparallel ﬁlter axes (ζn = −ζn′ ). If
these axes are parallel, the ﬁrst term in Eq. (42) determines
a usual Josephson current while the ﬁrst term in Eq. (43) de-
scribes a spontaneous current which exists in the absence of
the phase difference and has a direction depending on the
spin ﬁlter orientation ζn = ±1.
In the presence of the superconductor S (B 6= 0) the sec-
ond terms in Eqs. (42) and (43) are not zero in the case
of antiparallel ﬁlter axis. The second term in Eq. (42) is
a “Josephson”-like current66, whereas the second term in
Eq. (43) determines a spontaneous current. The phase
dependence of the second term in Eq. (42) at ζn = −ζn′ ,
Inn′ ∝ B(1− ζn ζn′ ) sin Φnn′, coincides with that in Ref. 88,
where the Josephson coupling occurred due to Majorana
modes. We apply Eqs. (42) and (43) to study the behavior
of three- and four-terminal Josephson contacts.

FIG. 6.
(Color online.) Cross-geometry setup with a singlet su-
perconductor when (a) bottom and left superconductors are con-
nected (thus, χL = χB); (b) bottom and right superconductors are
connected (thus, χR = χB). The blue arrows indicate the direction
of ﬁlters which let to pass triplet Cooper pairs with spins directed
parallel to the particular ﬁlter axis.

FRL = FRB = FLB ≡ F0, i.e., all Sm superconductors are
identical (generalization to a more general case of dif-
ferent Sm is trivial), we obtain for the setup displayed
in Fig. 5 (a):

F0 A´ sin ϕRL = −IB ,

IR = ³rRrL Xω≥0
IL = IR + IB = 0.

(44)

(45)

Equation (45) shows that no current ﬂows through
the left Sm superconductor.
The bias current
Ibias = IR = Ic sin(χR − χB) ﬂows through the usual
SmB/n/SmR JJ, and the critical Josephson current Ic is
given by the term in the square brackets. Note that
all the currents IL,R,B are the currents ﬂowing from
the n-wire into a corresponding superconductor. This
means that a negative IB is the current which ﬂows
from the superconductor SmB into the n-wire provid-
ing the continuity of the electric current.

A. Three-terminal all-triplet Sm/Fl/n/Fl/Sm junction

(b) In this system, Fig. 5 (b), the currents vanish,

First, we consider a simple case of a three-terminal
Josephson junction consisting only of Sm superconduc-
tors, that is, only triplet components exist in the n wire
[cf. Fig. 1 (a)].
In the case of parallel ﬁlter axes the be-
havior of the system under consideration is similar to that
of an ordinary multi-terminal system consisting of singlet
superconductors.60–63

More interesting is the case when triplet Cooper pairs
coming from the L-reservoir and from B- and R-reservoirs
(L, R, and B stand for, respectively, left, right, and bottom)
have oppositely oriented spins. One can easily calculate the
current through each interface from Eq. (42) taking into ac-
count that the coefﬁcient B is zero, B = 0.
We consider two cases shown in Fig. 5: (a) the left Sm
is connected with the bottom Sm superconductor so that
χL = χB; and (b) the right Sm is connected with the bottom
Sm superconductor so that χR = χB.

(a) Using Eq. (42) and setting, for the sake of simplicity,

IR = IB = IL = 0.

(46)

In this case, the system is an insulator for dissipa-
tionless current because the right and bottom Sm su-
perconductors may be considered as a single spin-up
Sm superconductor which does not “talk” to the left
spin-down superconductor SmL.

B. Four-terminal Sm/Fl/n/Fl/Sm junctions with a singlet

superconductor

Next, consider the four-terminal JJ shown in Fig. 6.

It
consists of a singlet superconductor S and three Sm su-
perconductors [right (R), left (L) and bottom (B)] creating
triplet components with equal chiralities (also, we assume
ζR = ζB = −ζL = 1) and connected by an n wire. We consider
again two cases: (a) the phases of the left and bottom Sm
superconductors are equal, χL = χB (if in the loop shown in

9

Comparison of Eqs. (50) and (51) shows that although
the singlet superconductor S is electrically discon-
nected from the circuit (no current ﬂows through the
S/n interface due to different symmetry of singlet and
triplet components), it strongly affects the critical cur-
rent of the system.

(b) SL In the case SL, when there is an additional connection
between the S superconductor and the left Sm super-
conductor [see Fig. 7 (b) with dashed line connecting
S and the left Sm only], one has χS = χL, while χR = χB.
Then, we obtain Ibias = IL and
IL = −2rR Xω≥0

F0B£rB + rR¤ sin ϕRL ≡ −I (b)

c sin ϕRL .

(52)

(b) SRB In the case SRB, when there is an additional con-
nection between the S superconductor and the right
Sm superconductor [see Fig. 7 (b) with dashed
line connecting S and the right Sm only], one has
χS = χR = χB. Then, the current IR is
F0B£rB + rR¤ sin ϕRL ≡ I (b)
IL = 2rR Xω≥0

c sin ϕRL .

(53)

We see that the critical current has different sign in
these two cases.

Note that the system in Fig. 6 (b) corresponds to the
“magnetic” case considered in Ref. 65 and the Josephson
current is similar to that obtained in Ref. 66 for a three ter-
minal Josephson junction. The case (a) corresponds to “ne-
matic” case since the spins of the triplet Cooper pairs com-
ing from the SL and SB superconductors have opposite di-
rections.

The case of different chiralities can be studied analo-

gously.

V. CONCLUSION.

We have considered the dc Josephson effect in a diffusive
multi-terminal Josephson junction which consists of some
“magnetic” superconductors and one singlet superconduc-
tor connected via a normal wire n. The “magnetic” super-
conductors are separated from the n wire by spin ﬁlters so
that only fully polarized triplet Cooper pairs can penetrate
into the n wire from these superconductors. We have shown
that if the spin ﬁlters in the two-terminal Sm/n/Sm Joseph-
son junctions are antiparallel, there is no current at arbi-
trary Sm/n interface transparency. The presence of an addi-
tional s-wave singlet superconductor terminal S results in a
ﬁnite Josephson current ﬂowing from the S superconductor
to the Sm superconductors; one can speak of conversion of
two singlet Cooper pairs into two triplet pairs with antipar-
allel total spins. The obtained unusual current–phase rela-
tion is compared with those which take place in other types
of Josephson contacts, for example, in JJs with the coupling
due to Majorana modes.88 Also, we have calculated the den-
sity of states in the normal wire for different types of two-
terminal JJs and compared the DOS for nematic and mag-
netic cases.

FIG. 7. (Color online.) Same cross-geometry setup with a singlet
superconductor as in Fig. 6 but in addition, in each case the super-
conductor S is connected to the left, respectively, right supercon-

[in (a)], SL, SRB [in (b)].

where Φ0 is the magnetic ﬂux quantum); and (b) the phases

Using Eqs. (41)–(43), we obtain for the Josephson currents

IL = −2rL Xω≥0
IR = rR Xω≥0
IB = rB Xω≥0

F0B£rR sin ΦLR + rB sin ΦLB¤ ,
F0£ArB sin ϕRB − rLB sin ΦRL¤ ,
F0£ArR sin ϕBR − rLB sin ΦBL¤ ,

(49)

where ϕBR = −ϕRB = χB − χR, ΦLR = ΦRL = χR + χL − 2χS,
ΦLB = ΦBL = χR + χL − 2χS, and we assume again that
FXY = F0 = (2πT )a fX− fY−E −3.
One can see that IL = IR + IB, i.e., in the applied approx-
imation of a small Sm/n interface transmittance, no cur-
rent ﬂows through the singlet S superconductor although
the phase of superconductor S affects the currents IR,L,B.

Consider furthermore the two different cases for an ad-
ditional connection of the S superconductor to the super-
conductors Sm (see Fig. 7), that is, for different relations be-
tween phases χS and χR,L,B.

(a) SLB In the case SLB, when there is an additional connec-
tion between the S superconductor and the left Sm su-
perconductor [see Fig. 7 (a) with dashed line con-
necting S and the left Sm only], one has χS = χL = χB.

ing S and the right Sm only], one has χS = χR, while
χL = χB. Then, the current IR is

A general formula for the Josephson current is derived
for the case of multi-terminal JJs under assumption that
the Sm/n interface transparencies are small. We applied
this formula for analysis of four-terminal JJs of different
types. Both, nematic and magnetic cases,65 can be real-
ized with the aid of the considered four-terminal JJs. In a
two-terminal structure with parallel ﬁlter orientations and
in a three-terminal structure with antiparallel ﬁlter orienta-
tions of the “magnetic” superconductors with attached ad-
ditional singlet superconductor, we ﬁnd a nonmonotonic
temperature dependence of the critical current. Also, in
these structures, the critical current shows a dependence on
the exchange ﬁeld in the “magnetic” superconductors with a
Riedel-like peak. We analyzed also Sm/n JJs when only fully
polarized triplet component exist in the n wire.

We showed also that, in the applied ﬁrst approximation in
the transmission coefﬁcient for Sm/n interfaces, no current
ﬂows through the singlet superconductor S due to orthogo-
nality of the triplet and singlet components, i.e., one can say
that the superconductor S is electrically disconnected from
the circuit. Nevertheless, the phase χS in the superconduc-
tor S affects the Josephson current in the system.

All effects discussed above can be observed on systems
that have been already studied experimentally.17–26,89–92 As
spin ﬁlters, one can use either magnetic insulating layers
or conducting magnetic half-metals.17,18,89 Some proper-
ties of ferromagnet/superconductor structures with a half-
metallic layers have been analyzed in a recent publication.93
In particular, the authors of Ref. 93 calculated the critical
temperature Tc of S/F/HM structures (where HM denotes
a half-metal), which have been studied experimentally on
MoGe/Cu/Ni/CrO2 hybrids,94 and analyzed the Josephson
effect in S/F/HM/F/S junctions. They have shown that a
spontaneous phase difference (ϕ-junction) arises in these
junctions (a similar effect has been predicted in Refs. 27
and 65).

Multiterminal JJs considered in the current Paper open
new routs to vary the types of the current–phase relations
for the Josephson current and to control the spin current.

the current IQ in Eq. (A14) can be written as

Ic = 2ar 2

S (2πT ) Xω≥0

F 2
S
q1+ γ2

c(ϕ)

.

IQ =

∞

Xn=1

In sin[(2n + 1)ϕ] .

(A16)

The coefﬁcient a is the same as in Eq. (A15) and related with
the critical current Ic via Eq. (A20).

87 The spin current ISp|n can be calculated in an analogous way
substituting Tr© ˆX30£ . . .¤ª by Tr© ˆX03£ . . .¤ª in the expression for
the charge current. We restrict ourselves with the calculation
of the electric current because experimental technique for ob-
serving the spin current is yet not as well developed as for
the charge current. Calculations of the spin current for some
special simpler cases of considered structures have been per-
formed in Refs. 65 and 66.
