The two-dimensional electron gas that forms at the interface of the band

insulators LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO) has attracted a great deal of atten-

tion due to the rich landscape of competing physical phenomena that have been

observed, including superconductivity, magnetism, gate-tunable spin-orbit in-

teraction, and gate-tunable superconductor-to-insulator and metal-to-insulator

transitions. Here we report low-temperature magnetotransport studies of (111)

LAO/STO interface samples. We ﬁnd that the transport properties are strongly

anisotropic. The anisotropy manifests itself in the longitudinal resistance, but

also unexpectedly in the Hall coeﬃcient as well as the capacitance, and is

accentuated by exposure to ultraviolet light, which disproportionately aﬀects

transport along one surface crystal direction. Furthermore, analysis of the low-

temperature Hall coeﬃcient and the capacitance as a function of back gate

voltage indicates that in addition to electrons, holes contribute to the electrical

transport. The origin of the hole conduction is not clear at present.

Most studies so far have been on (001) oriented LAO/STO,1–21 but (110) and (111)

LAO/STO interfaces, which have diﬀerent symmetries and consequently band structure,

are just beginning to be explored.22–24 However, detailed studies of either system as a func-

tion of gate voltage have not been reported. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the

(001), (110) and (111) oriented LAO/STO interfaces that raise the possibility of interesting

new behavior. Speciﬁcally, the symmetries of the band structure at each interface are dif-

ferent. In particular, the orbitals at the (111) interface have hexagonal symmetry (see Fig.

1(a)),25,26, with corresponding potentially novel properties.27 Thus it is of interest to study

the properties of the (111) LAO/STO interface in detail.

To this end, we have fabricated and performed low temperature magnetotransport mea-

surements on 20 monolayer (ML) (111) LAO/STO interface samples. Details of the growth

of the ﬁlms by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is described in Methods. While a number of

diﬀerent samples were measured, here we focus on measurements on one 5x5 mm2 chip on

which four Hall bars were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The substrates are cut so that
one edge is along the [1¯10] crystal direction, and the mutually orthogonal edge is along the
[¯1¯12] crystal direction; thus two of the Hall bars have their lengths along the [1¯10] direction,
and the other two are aligned along the [¯1¯12] direction. X-ray measurements were used to

determine the actual crystal orientation, which is marked in Fig. 1(b). While all four Hall

bars were measured, Hall bars oriented along the same crystal direction have essentially

identical measured properties. Consequently, we show here data for only the two Hall bars

whose electrical contacts are marked in Fig. 1(b).

Figure 2(a) shows the longitudinal sheet resistance R(cid:3) of these two Hall bars at 4.4 K

as a function of the voltage Vg applied to the STO substrate. The most striking aspect of

the data is that the resistance is highly anisotropic: while the resistances of both Hall bars

are roughly the same at large positive Vg, they start to diverge at small positive Vg, and
diﬀer by more than a factor of 6 at Vg = −60 V. This anisotropy is even larger at millikelvin
temperatures, with the resistance in the [¯1¯12] direction changing little, while the resistance
in the [1¯10] direction increases substantially with decreasing temperature (not shown). As

with the (001) samples, the measured resistance is hysteretic in Vg. This hysteresis is likely

due to defect states that can take hours to relax, particularly at large negative Vg, where

the samples are more resistive. On stopping the Vg sweep, the resistance relaxes in time to a

value between the up and down sweeps. Experimentally, we ﬁnd that the average of the up-

and down-sweep curves at diﬀerent sweep rates fall on top of each other (see Supplemental

Information); we consider this averaged curve a measure of the long time-scale behavior

of the system. Consequently, in what follows, we shall present averaged curves for the Vg

dependence of the longitudinal resistance (as shown in Fig. 2(a)) and the capacitance.

Further evidence of anisotropic behavior can be found in the Hall coeﬃcient RH, which

we determine by measuring the Hall resistance in a magnetic ﬁeld H applied perpendicular

In the range µ0H ∼ ±400 mT, the measured
Hall resistance is linear. We deﬁne the Hall coeﬃcient RH as the slope of the Hall resistance

vs. H. The solid symbols in Fig. 2(b) show RH as a function of Vg for both Hall bars. For

a single band of charge carriers, RH = 1/nq, where n is the areal density of the carriers,

and the sign of RH is indicative of the sign of the carrier charge. The sign of RH in our

samples at all Vg is electron-like, but the dependence of RH on Vg is not as expected for a

single band of electrons, or even multiple bands of electrons. As Vg is increased, one expects

that more electrons would be drawn to the interface, so that the electron density ne would

increase. The increase in ne should lead to a decrease in the longitudinal resistance, as we
observe, but it should also lead to a decrease in |RH| ∼ 1/ne with increasing Vg. Instead,
an increase in |RH| with Vg is observed for both Hall bars. This can only occur if holes in
addition to electrons contribute to the transport. We note that in earlier experiments on

(001) LAO/STO samples, a similar anomalous dependence of RH on Vg was also observed,5
while other experiments observed a non-monotonic dependence on Vg.11 In the present case,

while the magnitude and overall trend of RH is the same for both crystal orientations, the
detailed dependence on Vg is diﬀerent: while |RH| for the [¯1¯12] direction saturates at large
positive Vg and decreases rapidly at negative Vg, |RH| for the [1¯10] direction shows a roughly
linear dependence, with a reproducible jump in |RH| between Vg = 20 V and Vg = 30 V.

In order to model the dependence of RH, we ﬁt the data to the simplest two-band model

with one electron band and one hole band:

(1)
where R(e,h) = ∓1/(n(e,h)e) are the Hall coeﬃcients and σ(e,h) = n(e,h)eµ(e,h) are the conduc-
tivities of the electrons and holes respectively. Here n(e,h) and µ(e,h) are the corresponding

areal densities and mobilities. Details of the ﬁtting procedure and numerical values of the ﬁt

parameters are given in the Supplementary Information. In general, the ratio ne/nh is about
50 for the [1¯10] direction, but ∼ 103 for the [¯1¯12] direction, showing that electrons contribute
more to the transport in the [1¯12] direction. We are unable to ﬁt the Vg dependence of RH

with the analogous equation for two electron bands for any sensible range of parameters, so

we conclude that both electron and holes must contribute to the electrical transport. Note

that the anisotropy in RH is unexpected if the same bands contribute to transport in both

directions, unless the mobilities of charge carriers in these bands along the two directions

5

are also anisotropic, or unless diﬀerent bands contribute to transport in the two diﬀerent

directions.

In addition to R(cid:3) and RH, we also measured the Vg dependence of the capacitance C

between the back gate and each individual Hall bar. To measure C, we superpose a small

amplitude ac voltage on Vg, and measure the resulting ac current drained from one contact of

the Hall bar. A detailed analysis shows that the component of the ac current in quadrature

to the applied ac voltage is a direct measure of C. (Details of the measurement technique and

analysis can be found in the Supplementary Information.) For a low-density two-dimensional

carrier gas, C is the series combination of the conventional geometric capacitance Cg and the
so-called quantum capacitance CQ = e2S(dn/dE),3,4 which is associated with the change in

chemical potential resulting from the induced charge. Here S is the area of the capacitor and

dn/dE the density of states. Cg can be determined by measuring the capacitance between

the back gate and a large metallic electrode deposited directly on the etched STO substrate

of the same chip. We ﬁnd that Cg is large, but more important, varies by less than 1 part
in 105 over the full range of Vg (see Supplementary Information), so that any variation of C

with Vg is related to CQ, and hence dn/dE. Figure 2(c) shows C for the two Hall bars as

a function of Vg. Comparison of the magnitude of C between two diﬀerent Hall bars is not

meaningful (see Supplementary Information), so here we concentrate on the dependence of

C on Vg. For both crystal directions, C (and by extension dn/dE) is larger at positive Vg in

comparison to negative Vg, so that we might expect the measured resistance to be smaller at

positive Vg, as is observed. C for both Hall bars appears to saturate at negative Vg; indeed
the [1¯10] Hall bar shows hints of an increase in C with decreasing Vg below Vg ∼ −60 V, a
feature that is more prominent on some of the other samples we have measured. For a purely

electron-like dn/dE, one would expect to see a monotonic decrease in C with decreasing Vg:

the saturation or increasing C that we observe at negative Vg is further evidence that holes

participate in electrical transport.

The data of Fig. 2 show that there is a clear diﬀerence in the transport characteristics
between the [1¯10] and [¯1¯12] crystal directions. A closer look shows that for the [1¯10] direction,
a distinct transition seems to occur at Vg ∼ 20 V. This is seen in the Hall data, where there
is a sharp drop in RH that is observed in multiple devices. The feature in RH is correlated
with a corresponding drop in C vs Vg for the [1¯10] direction in comparison to the [¯1¯12]

6

direction; Vg ∼ 20 V is also roughly the voltage below which the resistances of the two
crystal orientations start to diverge strongly. Band structure calculations and ARPES data

indicate that the bottom of the conduction bands in both directions should be at the same

energy, so that one might expect to see similar gradual changes in both directions until the
common band edge is reached. We believe our data suggests that the band edge in the [1¯10]
direction is at higher energy than the band edge in the [¯1¯12] direction, and that conduction

below the band edge is determined by transport through defect states.

of the devices (R(cid:3), RH and C) after irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light under ambient

conditions for 15 minutes. (Details of this treatment can be found in the Supplementary
Information.) This treatment appears to disproportionately aﬀect transport in the [1¯10]
direction for Vg (cid:46) 20 V. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the data for the two crystal

same as that shown in Fig. 2.) For R(cid:3), the resistance in both directions at negative Vg
after UV irradiation increases. In the [1¯10] direction, the pre- and post-UV R(cid:3)’s start to
diverge signiﬁcantly below Vg ∼ 20 V, while the diﬀerence in the pre/post UV R(cid:3) for the
[¯1¯12] direction grows steadily over the entire Vg range. More notable diﬀerences can be seen
in RH and C. While RH for the [¯1¯12] direction shows little change after UV treatment, RH
for the [1¯10] direction starts to decrease in comparison with the pre-UV values for Vg (cid:46) 20
V: at Vg = −40 V, RH is close to 0. However, the changes in C are most striking. For
the [1¯12] direction, C before and after UV exposure is approximately the same, except for

a small range of Vg above 65 V. (Note that here, comparison of the magnitudes of C are
meaningful, as the data are for the same Hall bar, and S has not changed.) For the [1¯10]

direction, however, C drops oﬀ sharply as one goes from positive to negative Vg, indicating
a corresponding drop in dn/dE at around Vg ∼ 20 V, the same voltage range at which the
diﬀerences between pre- and post-UV in the measured RH and R(cid:3) become apparent. These

data strongly suggest that the number of electrons available to participate in transport at
Vg (cid:46) 20 V for the [1¯10] direction decrease substantially after UV irradiation. As we noted
before, the data suggest that we reach the band edge at higher Vg for the [1¯10] direction in
comparison to the [¯1¯12] direction; the diﬀerences in pre- and post-UV measurements suggest

further that the states that contribute to conduction below the band edge are reduced by

the UV treatment.

In summary, we observe strongly anisotropic transport characteristics in (111)-oriented

LAO/STO along two orthogonal crystal directions. The gate dependence of the Hall data

show that holes in addition to electrons contribute to the conductivity, which has not been

reported previously. The transport characteristics can be modiﬁed by UV treatment, which

aﬀects transport along the two orthogonal crystal directions in diﬀerent ways. Our results

indicate that clarifying the role of defect states is critical to understanding transport in

8

these conducting interfaces.

Methods

The samples were prepared by pulsed laser deposition using a KrF laser (λ = 248 nm). A

LAO single crystal target is used for deposition. During the deposition, the laser repetition

is kept at 1 Hz, laser ﬂuence at 1.8 J/cm2, growth temperature at 650 degrees Celsius, and

oxygen pressure at 1 mTorr. The deposition is monitored by in-situ reﬂection high energy

electron diﬀraction (RHEED).

The Hall bars were patterned using photolithography that deﬁned an etch mask used for

subsequent argon ion milling, which etched down to the bare STO, leaving the LAO on top

of the Hall bars. A subsequent photolithography step deposited a Au ﬁlm on the electrical

contacts to enable visual location of the contacts for wirebonding. Au was also deposited on

the bare etched STO, which enabled us to measure the geometric capacitance as described

in the Supplementary Information, and also to conﬁrm that the bare STO itself did not

become conducting after the ion milling step.

The samples were measured in a home-built liquid helium cryogenic insert, a Kelvinox

MX100 dilution refrigerator, and a Kelvinox 300 dilution refrigerator, although the results

reported here are only at liquid helium temperatures. All measurement rigs were equipped

with superconducting solenoids that permitted measurement of the Hall eﬀect. To mea-
sure the electrical characteristics of the Hall bars, an ac current of amplitude ∼20 nA was
introduced using a home-built low noise current source with output impedance > 1012 Ω,

and the resulting longitudinal or transverse voltage was detected with a lock-in ampliﬁer

after a ﬁrst-stage ampliﬁcation stage with gain 10-100 using a custom-built low noise voltage

ampliﬁer. Due to the very high resistances of the devices, particularly at low temperatures

and negative Vg, the ac excitation frequency was in the range of 1-2 Hz.

After the ﬁrst round of measurements are made on the devices, we exposed the device

to UV radiation using a homemade exposure system that utilizes UV ﬂuorescent tubes to

expose the sample, which was held 1 mm away from the tube at room temperature and

atmosphere. After 1 minute of exposure the R(cid:3) of the sample rose from 133 kΩ to 141

kΩ. This change relaxed back to the initial state over the 4-5 hours at room temperature.

If cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures or lower the sample stays at a stable resistance

value over all measured time scales, or until it is brought back to room temperature. Longer

exposures, of up to 15 minutes, yield a change in room temperature R(cid:3) of up to 214kΩ and

relax over increasingly longer time scales.

I. X-RAY CHARACTERIZATION

To determine the crystal orientation of the Hall bars shown in Fig. 1(b) of the manuscript,

we utilized a Photonic Science Laue X-ray camera. The sample was mounted on a goniometer

stage for precise alignment. The images were ﬁt using the commercial PSL software provided

with the camera, which allowed simultaneous determination of both Hall bar orientations

on the substrate, which are as marked in Fig. 1(b) of the main manuscript.

II. HYSTERETIC BEHAVIOR OF SHEET REISTANCE AND CAPACITANCE

As mentioned in the main text, we consider the average of the up and down gate voltage

sweeps of the sheet resistance and the capacitance as a measure of the long-term behavior

of the Hall bars. This is because both the sheet resistance R(cid:3) and the capacitance C show

relaxation over long time scales, which manifests itself as hysteresis when Vg is swept. The

relaxation times are typically longer at lower temperatures and higher resistances. If the gate

voltage sweep is stopped at a speciﬁc point, RH and C will drift to a value corresponding

to the average of the up- and down-sweep traces at that value of Vg and at that sweep rate.

At millikelvin temperatures and at large negative Vg, this drift can take place over hours or

even days. We speculate that this relaxation is due to defect states that relax slowly to lower

energy conﬁgurations over long time scales. Experimentally, we ﬁnd that as the sweep rate

the same. This is shown in Fig. S4, which shows two diﬀerent RH vs. Vg hysteresis loops

taken over 16 hours and 24 hours, and the respective averages over the up and down sweeps,

which are essentially identical. Thus, the averaged curves are measures of the long-term

behavior of the devices.

III. ANALYSIS OF GATE DEPENDENT HALL COEFFICIENTS

To analyze the gate dependence of the Hall coeﬃcients shown in Fig. 2 and 3 of the

main text using Eq. (1) of the main text, we assume that the electron and hole densities

ne and nh have a linear dependence on Vg. We also make the simplifying assumption that

the mobilities of the electrons and holes µe and µh are independent of Vg. Thus, there are

nominally 6 parameters that can be varied to obtain a ﬁt of RH as a function of Vg: the

values of ne and nh at Vg = 0, the assumed linear slopes dne/dVg and dnh/dVg, and the

mobilities µe and µh. We use the measured value of the 2D conductivity σ = 1/R(cid:3) as a

function of Vg to reduce the number of parameters by one, since σe + σh = σ, using as a 5th

ﬁtting parameter the ratio of mobilities µr = µe/µh, subject to the constraint that ne(Vg)eµe

+nh(Vg)eµh = σ(Vg). The parameters obtained from the ﬁts before and after UV exposure

are given in the tables below:

IV. CAPACITANCE MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS

In order to measure the the capacitance, we use a technique similar to one that has

been previously used by other groups to measure the capacitance of GaAs/AlGaAs two-

dimensional electron gases1–4. We superpose a 100 mV ac voltage on the dc back-gate

voltage (see Fig. S5(a)). This is done by summing a dc voltage and an ac voltage from the

oscillator of an EG&G digital lock-in ampliﬁer with a home-made summing ampliﬁer, the

output of which is used to drive a Kepco 100/1 power supply/ampliﬁer. The output of the

Kepco is then applied in turn to the back-gate. One contact of the Hall bar is connected to

the input of of a home-made current preampliﬁer whose output is fed to the input of the lock-

in ampliﬁer. It is important to ensure that all other contacts of the Hall bar remain open,

so that the only current that can ﬂow is to the current preampliﬁer. The signals that are in

phase and in quadrature with the ac voltage applied to the back gate are then monitored as

a function of Vg. The Kepco has a reasonably ﬂat frequency response up until approximately

2.5 kHz; for the greatest sensitivity, we desire to operate at the highest frequency possible,

hence the capacitance data for this work was taken at a frequency of 2.3 kHz. Under these

circumstances, the quadrature signal is a direct measure of the capacitance, as we show

below. We have tested this measurement conﬁguration on standard capacitors attached to

our cryogenic inserts with values close to the measured capacitances of our sample, and

the measured values agree within less than 1 % with their values measured on the bench

with commercial capacitance bridges. In addition to ensuring that our measurement setup

is accurate, this also indicates that the capacitance of the wires going down the cryogenic

insert do not signiﬁcantly alter the measured capacitance.

A capacitor with some leakage can be described as a pure capacitance C in parallel

with a low conductance G. The admittance Y of this parallel arrangement is then simply

Y = G + jωC, where we have employed engineering notation, so that the quadrature signal

is a direct measure of the capacitance. However, the conducting interface can also have

appreciable resistance depending on Vg, and in order to determine whether this resistance

might account for the anisotropy in the measured capacitance that we observe, we have

modeled the sample as a transmission line with a capacitance per unit length c = C/L, a

conductance per unit length g = G/L, and an interface resistance per unit length rs = Rs/L,

as shown in Fig. S5(b) (here L is the total length of the sample). The transmission line

Figure 6 shows the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary components of Y
measured for the [1¯10] Hall bar for Vg = 0V at 4.4 K. The ﬁts are quite reasonable; we

believe that the small discrepancy between the ﬁts and data is due to the phase dependence

sweep. The values of Rs and G are also reasonable: Rs agrees to within 10 % of the measured

resistance of the sample at that value of Vg, which we consider good agreement. The values
obtained for G are ∼ 10−15 S. In fact, the ﬁts are insensitive to G in this range, and we take
G = 0 in our further analysis. With G = 0, Eq. S2 gives the following expressions for the
real and imaginary components of Y (Y = Y (cid:48) + jY (cid:48)(cid:48))

FIG. 7. Solid symbols: Capacitance obtained by simultaneously ﬁtting the real and imaginary

components of the measured admittance to Eq. S3 at each value of Vg, for both Hall bars at 4.4K.

Solid lines are the measured quadrature component divided by ω.

We have used Eq. S3 to ﬁt the real and imaginary parts of the measured admittance as

a function of gate voltage. The solid symbols in Fig. S7 show the capacitance C obtained

from simultaneously ﬁtting the real and imaginary parts of Y to Eq. S3. For comparison, we
show the measured imaginary component Y (cid:48)(cid:48)/ω. The curves for both samples are identical,
showing that the resistance of the interface Rs does not aﬀect the measured capacitance,
and that the imaginary component of the admittance is simply Y (cid:48)(cid:48) = ωC. In fact, this is the
limit of Eq. S3 for ωRsC << 1. Consequently, we can determine the capacitance directly
from the quadrature signal. It should be noted that the insensitivity of Y (cid:48)(cid:48) to Rs in our

not due to the anisotropy in the sheet resistance of the two Hall bars.

IV.1. Geometric capacitance

To determine the geometric capacitance Cg, we have measured the capacitance between

the back gate and a gold contact placed on top of the etched STO part of the chip. The gold

contact is 150 µm by 3 mm long. Figure S8 shows Cg as a function of Vg at 4.4 K. While
there is some hysteresis, Cg varies by less than 1 part in 105, showing that Cg is essentially

independent of Vg.

The capacitance that we measure between the back gate and a Hall bar sample includes

the entire area of the Hall bar, which in addition to the Hall bar itself, also includes the

voltage and current contacts on which we make the wire bonds. In fact, the area of the

contacts is a substantial fraction of the total area of the device. However, the wire bonds

punch through to the interface gas, decreasing the area of the capacitor, and since the each

wire bond is diﬀerent, the eﬀective area of each Hall bar capacitor is diﬀerent. Consequently,

we cannot compare the absolute values of the measured capacitance of two diﬀerent Hall

bars. However, for the same Hall bar before and after UV irradiation, a comparison is

meaningful, since we do not remove the wire-bonds during the irradiation process.
