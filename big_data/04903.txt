A voltage pulse of a Lorentzian shape carrying a half of the ﬂux quantum excites out of a zero-
temperature Fermi sea an electron in a mixed state, which looks like a quasi-particle with an
eﬀectively fractional charge e/2. A prominent feature of such an excitation is a narrow peak in the
energy distribution function laying exactly at the Fermi energy µ. Another spectacular feature is
that the distribution function has symmetric tails as above as below µ, which results in a zero energy
of an excitation. This sounds improbable since at zero temperature all available states below µ are
fully occupied. The resolution is lying in the fact that such a voltage pulse excites also electron-hole
pairs which free some space below µ and thus allow a zero-energy quasi-particle to exist. I discuss
also how to address separately electron-hole pairs and a fractionally charged zero-energy excitation
in experiment.

Introduction.– Recent realization of a triggered single-
electron source [1–10] opens a new era for a coherent elec-
tronics [11–18] by allowing it to go quantum much like a
quantum optics. The analogues of the famous quantum
optics eﬀects were successfully demonstrated with single
electrons in solid state circuits such as partitioning of
electrons [7, 19–21] in Hanbury-Brown and Twiss geom-
etry and quantum-statistical repulsion of electrons [7, 22]
in Hong-Ou-Mandel geometry. Tomography of a single-
electron state [23] and a preparation of few-electron Fock
states [20, 24, 25] are already reported.

An essential diﬀerence from quantum optics is that
single electrons are injected into an electron wave-guide
with another electrons such as, for instance, a quantum
Hall edge channel [26–28]. During such an injection the
source can excite an electron system and the resulting
excitations can mask injected electrons. However if the
protocol of injection is properly chosen [29] no spurious
excitations appear. This was clearly demonstrated theo-
retically [30–32] and experimentally [7] in the case where
single electrons are excited by applying a voltage pulse
V (t) across a ballistic conductor.
It was shown that a
voltage pulse of a Lorentzian shape with quantized Fara-

day ﬂux, ϕ ≡ (e/)(cid:82) dtV (t) = 2πn (where e is the elec-

tron charge,  is Plank’s constant, n is an integer), excites
only n electrons (or holes, if n < 0) with no accompa-
nying electron-hole pairs. These excitations were named
levitons.[7] While if the ﬂux is not quantized, ϕ (cid:54)= 2πn,
then what is excited is rather a messy state with a diver-
gent number of quasi-particles, both electrons and holes.

Here I show, however, that the ﬂux ϕ = π is especial.
The Fermi sea excited by a Lorentzian voltage pulse with
a half-integer ﬂux hosts an exotic single-particle excita-
tion, which cannot exist in equilibrium, see Fig. 1. Such
an excitation has an eﬀective charge e/2, hence I name
it a half-leviton (HL). Importantly, an electron-hole state
(which is also excited because the ﬂux is not quantized)

is indispensable for existence of HLs. This is so since the
state of a half-leviton is a superposition of states with
energies laying from both sides of the Fermi energy µ,
below and above it. At zero temperature all the state
below the Fermi energy are fully occupied and only ex-
cited holes (belonging to electron-hole pairs) free some
states below µ and allow a half-leviton to be formed.

HLs
require necessarily accompanying electron-hole
pairs; FCCPs are fractional charge quasi-particles in a
pure state, while HLs are rather quasi-particles with an
integer charge e being in a mixed state such that an
eﬀective charge is e/2; FCCPs carry a positive energy
(counted from the Fermi energy), while HLs have a zero
energy.

The last circumstance allows HL to annihilate (with-
out breaking a phase coherence) its anti-particle, which
is excited by a voltage pulse carrying a ﬂux of an oppo-
site sign, see Fig. 2. Such a coherent annihilation on a
wave splitter is impossible with ordinary quasi-particles,
electrons and holes, whose energies lie above and below
the Fermi energy, respectively. Therefore, they can be
annihilated only as a result of inelastic processes, which
generally break phase coherence. The elastic collisions
of ordinary single electrons and holes do not lead to an-
nihilation [34–37] unless in speciﬁc setups. For instance,
where an electron emitted by one source is passed by and
reabsorbed by the another source attempting to emit a
hole.[38] Another example is a setup where energies of
electrons and holes are aligned but the success rate of
annihilation is small.[39] A possibility for a perfect coher-
ent annihilation of particles on a wave splitter predicted
here opens a route for entangling Fock states with diﬀer-
ent number of fermions in solid-state quantum circuits.
Half-leviton.– To characterize quasi-particles arising
in a one-dimensional chiral or ballistic system of non-
interacting spinless electrons under the action of a dy-
namic excitation, an electron source, we introduce the
excess ﬁrst-order correlation function [40, 41]. This func-
tion is deﬁned as the diﬀerence of electronic correla-
tion functions with the source on and oﬀ, G(1) (1; 2) =

In-
coming electrons are described by the Fermi distribution
function with the chemical potential µ and temperature
θ. We will utilize the wide band approximation, when
all the relevant energy scales are small compared to µ
and the spectrum of electrons of the Fermi sea can be
linearized around the Fermi energy. In such a case the
excess correlation function depends on a reduced time
tj ≡ tj − xj/vµ (with vµ the Fermi velocity) rather than
on space and time coordinates separately.

If quasi-particles are excited by a time-dependent volt-
age V (t), then at zero temperature the excess correlation
function is, [42]

The ﬁrst term, gHL, is factorized into the product of two
terms dependent on a single time each.
It describes a
single-particle excitation since all corresponding higher-
order correlation functions are identically zero.[43] I call
it a half-leviton because it is excited by a half voltage
pulse, which excites a leviton [7], and mark corresponding
quantities by a subscript HL. This excitation carries a
charge q(cid:63)
a charge is fractional one needs to note that the state
of HL is a mixed state. This follows from the fact that
the purity coeﬃcient [42] calculated for gHL is less then

HL = e(cid:82) dtgHL (t; t) = e/2. To understand why
one: PHL =(cid:82) dtgHL (t1; t) gHL (t; t2) /gHL (t1; t2) = 0.5 .

Since q(cid:63)
HL = ePHL one can say that the state in question
corresponds to a single-particle with an integer charge
e appearing with probability PHL and a vacuum state
appearing with probability 1− PHL. Threfore, q(cid:63)
HL is an
eﬀective charge.
Using the purity coeﬃcient we can write, gHL (t1; t2) =
PHLΦ∗
HL(t1)ΦHL(t2), and ﬁnd that a corresponding
single-particle wave function ΦHL(t) can be chosen real-
valued,

and normalized to one,(cid:82) dt|ΦHL(t)|2 = 1. Note that this

wave function is symmetric in time, ΦHL(t) = ΦHL(−t).
The second term in Eq. (2) describes electron-hole ex-
citations (hence a subscript eh), which do not carry any
charge, Ieh(t) ≡ eg(1)
eh (t; t) = 0. Their presence can be
veriﬁed via the shot noise measurement [7, 19] or with
the help of an interference current [44, 45]). Electron-
hole pairs do carry energy injected by a voltage pulse
into an electron system. In contrast, HL does not carry
any energy. To show this let us go over from time domain
to energy domain and introduce the energy distribution
function for excited particles, see, e.g. Ref. 46:

f () =

where  is an energy counted from the Fermi energy. The
function f () is a probability density to ﬁnd an excited
particle with energy . Using a correlation function given
in Eq. (2) we ﬁnd,

f () = fHL() + feh(),

In the last equation I used g(1)

The distribution function is normalized such that

(cid:82) df () = PHL. Electron-hole pairs do not contribute to
(cid:82) dfeh() = 0. To get separately the number of either

this equation. The reason is the following. By virtue of
deﬁnition, electron and hole contributions to the excess
correlation function and, correspondingly, to the distri-
bution function feh() have opposite signs. As a result

electrons or holes we have to integrate feh() over either
positive or negative energies only.
The distribution function of a half-leviton is shown in
Fig. 1. This function is even in energy, fHL() = fHL(−)
and, therefore, it does not contribute to the energy of
excitations (cid:104)(cid:105) = (cid:104)(cid:105)HL + (cid:104)(cid:105)eh,

dfHL() = 0.

(6)

This is why I call a half-leviton a zero-energy excitation.
In contrast, a true leviton, excited by a voltage pulse

with n(cid:63) = 1, has a non-zero energy, (cid:104)(cid:105)L =(cid:82) dfL() =

/(2Γτ ),[32] see the inset to Fig. 1 for leviton’s distribu-
tion function fL().

Note that HL’s energy is zero on average only but it
does ﬂuctuate. This fact diﬀers HL from quasi-particles
in Majorana zero modes in topological insulators and su-
perconductors, whose energy is strictly zero, see, e.g.,

(cid:90)

(cid:104)(cid:105)HL =

3

Refs. [47, 48]. In addition HL is charged while a Majo-
rana fermion is neutral.
The distribution function for electron-hole pairs is an
odd function of energy, feh() = −feh(−). There-
fore, namely electron-hole pairs do carry (excess) energy,
which is pumped by a time-dependent voltage V (t) into
the Fermi sea:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:48)=t

This energy is a quarter of the energy of a leviton.

The same result follows also from a time-dependent
heat current, JQ(t), induced by a voltage pulse.[49] At
zero temperature one can ﬁnd quite generally [50] that
a charge current I(t) = eg(t; t) and a heat current, both
induced by a voltage pulse in a single-channel chiral or
ballistic conductor, comply with the Joule law,

JQ(t) = RqI 2(t),

(8)

where Rq = h/(2e2) is the charge relaxation resis-
tance [51], the B¨uttiker resistance [52]. Heat is nothing
but the excess energy carried by excitations.[53] Indeed,

(cid:82) dtJQ(t) = /(8Γτ ), which agrees with Eq. (7).

The fact that the Joule law, Eq. (8), works in the
present case is remarkable, since charge and heat are
carried by diﬀerent pieces of the excited state, HL and
electron-hole pairs, respectively. Actually these pieces
can be separated in experiment. To show this let us ﬁrst
consider what is excited by a voltage pulse of an opposite
sign.

What is changed is the sign of a charge of a single-
electron excitation, which now I call an anti-half-leviton
(aHL).

surement made on G(1)

of a half-leviton.

Note that the excess ﬁrst-order correlation function
contains all information about excitations, their charge,

energy, ﬂuctuations, coherence times, etc. The correla-
tion function is additive and, therefore, it is speciﬁcally
suitable for the electron-hole pairs elimination procedure
outlined above. The correlation function can be directly
measured with the help of an interference current as it
was suggested in Refs. 41, 54. Moreover, the distribu-
tion function fHL(), Fig. 1, can be measured using al-
ready available experimental tools, quantum dots as en-
ergy ﬁlters.[55] The level width of a quantum dot restricts
the precision of measurement of a zero-energy peak. An-
other factor limiting a precision is a non-zero temperature
of the Fermi sea.

symmetric around  = 0.

Conclusion.– Dynamically perturbed Fermi sea can
host exotic zero-energy excitations with an eﬀectively
fractional charge.
In this Letter I discussed an exam-
ple of such a quasi-particle, which can be excited by a

line), k = 10 (blue dashed line), and k = 20 (black short-
dashed line). For a voltage pulse with width 2Γτ = 30 ps [7]

nique that was used to generate levitons [7, 23]. A single
particle with an eﬀective charge e/2, a half-leviton (HL),
is excited together with a cloud of electron-hole pairs,
which, however, can be isolated and used as the reference
point for studying HL. A half-leviton is described by a
single-particle state, which is mixed in equal proportions
with the vacuum state hence a fractional charge. This
single-particle state is a coherent superposition of states
with energies symmetrically placed near the Fermi en-
ergy. Therefore, the energy of HL counted from the Fermi
energy is zero. The wave function of HL is real-valued
and, therefore, it remains the same when we go over to
an anti-HL, a particle excited by a voltage pulse with
ϕ = −π. These properties enable HL and anti-HL to an-
nihilate each other while colliding at an electronic wave
splitter, what paves a way for entangling fermionic Fock
states with diﬀerent number of particles. Dynamic exci-
tation of an electron many-particle system is an exciting
and promising platform for quantum coherent electron-
ics, which “...does not require delicate nanolithography,
considerably simplifying the circuitry for scalability” [7].
