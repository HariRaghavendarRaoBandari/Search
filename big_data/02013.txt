Abstract

We study the semi-leptonic and non-leptonic decays of Bc meson to D-wave charmonia, namely,
ηc2(11D2), ψ2(13D2), and ψ3(13D3). In our calculations, the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter method
is applied to achieve the hadronic matrix elements. This method includes relativistic corrections
which are important especially for the higher orbital excited states. For the semi-leptonic decay
channels with e as the ﬁnal lepton, we get the branching ratios B[Bc → ηc2e¯νe] = 5.87 × 10−4,
B[Bc→ψ2e¯νe] = 1.54 × 10−4, and B[Bc→ψ3e¯νe] = 3.5 × 10−4. The transition form factors, forward-
backward asymmetries, and lepton spectra in these processes are also presented. For the non-leptonic
decay channels, those with ρ as the lighter meson have the largest branching ratios, B[Bc→ηc2ρ] =
8.13 × 10−4, B[Bc→ψ2ρ] = 9.62 × 10−5, and B[Bc→ψ3ρ] = 4.14 × 10−4.

1. Introduction

In 2013, the Belle Collaboration reported the evidence of a new resonance X(3823) in the B
decay channel B±→X(→χc1γ)K ± with a statistical signiﬁcance of 3.8σ [1]. And very recently, the
BESIII collaboration veriﬁed its existence with a statistical signiﬁcance of 6.2σ [2]. Both groups
got the similar mass and the ratio of partial decay width for this particle. On one hand, this state
has a mass of 3821.7 ± 1.3(stat) ± 0.7(syst) MeV/c2, which is very near the mass value of the 13D2
charmonium predicted by potential models [3, 4]; on the other hand, the electromagnetic decay
channels χc1γ and χc2γ are observed while the later one is suppressed, which means the 11D2 and
13D3 charmonia cases are excluded.

To conﬁrm the above experimental results and compare with other theoretical predictions, study-
ing the properties of D-wave charmonia in a diﬀerent approach is deserved. In this work we study
the ψ2(13D2) and its two partners ηc2(11D2) and ψ3(13D3) in the weak decays of Bc meson which
has attracted lots of attention since its discovery by the CDF Collaboration at Fermilab [5]. Unlike
the charmonia and bottomonia which are hidden-ﬂavor bound states, the Bc meson, which consists
of a bottom anti-quark (¯b) and a charmed quark (c), is open-ﬂavor. Besides that, it’s the ground
state, which means it cannot decay through strong or electromagnetic interaction. So the Bc meson
provides an ideal platform to study the weak interaction.

The semi-leptonic and non-leptonic transitions of the Bc meson into charmonium states are
important processes for Bc meson. Experimentally, only those with J/ψ or ψ(2S) as the ﬁnal
charmonium have been detected [6]. As the LHC accumulates more and more data, the weak
decay processes of Bc meson to charmonia with other quantum numbers have the possibility to be
detected. That is to say, this is an alternative way to study the charmonia, especially those have
not yet been discovered, such as ηc2(11D2) and ψ3(13D3). Theoretically, the semi-leptonic and non-
leptonic transitions of the Bc meson into S-wave charmonium states are studied widely by several
phenomenological models, such as the relativistic constituent quark model [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
the non-relativistic constituent quark model [13], the technique of hard and soft factorization [14]

and QCD factorization [15], QCD sum rules [16], Light-cone sum rules [17], the perturbative QCD
approach [18, 19], and NRQCD [20, 21]. There are also some theoretical models to study the processes
of Bc decay to a P -wave charmonium [22, 8, 23, 24, 25, 26], while we lack the information of Bc
decay to a D-wave charmonium.

Here we will use the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) method to investigate the exclusive semi-leptonic and
non-leptonic decays of the Bc meson to the D-wave charmonium. This method has been used to study
processes with P -wave charmonium [22, 26]. As is known to all, the BS equation [27] is a relativistic
two-body bound state equation. To solve BS equation of D-wave mesons and get corresponding wave
function and mass spectra, we use the instantaneous approximation, that is, we solve the Salpeter
equations [28] which has been widely used for bound states decay problems [29, 30, 31]. Here we will
not give the details of these equations, and just use the result given by our previous work [32].

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we present the general formalism for semi-
leptonic and non-leptonic decay widths of Bc into D-wave charmonia.
In Section 3 we give the
analytic expressions of the corresponding form factors given by the BS method. In Section 4 the
numerical results are achieved and we compare our results with others’. Section 5 is a little summary
of this work. Bulky analytical expressions of hadronic matrix element and the form factors for decay
processes with 11D2 charmonium are presented in the Appendix.

2. Formalisms of Semileptonic and Nonleptonic Decays

In this Section we will derive the formalism for the calculation of both semi-leptonic and non-

leptonic decay widths of the Bc meson.

2.1. The Semi-leptonic Decay

The semi-leptonic decays of Bc meson into D-wave charmonia are three-body decay processes.
We consider the neutrinos as massless fermions. The diﬀerential form of the three-body decay width
can be written as

(1)

dΓ =

64π3M 3|M|2dm2

12dm2

23,

where M is the mass of Bc; m12 is the invariant mass of ﬁnal c¯c meson and neutrino which is deﬁned
as m2
12 = (PF + pν)2; m23 is the invariant mass of ﬁnal neutrino and charged lepton, which is deﬁned
as m2
23 = (pν + pℓ)2. Here we have used PF , pν and pℓ to denote the 4-momentum of ﬁnal c¯c meson,
neutrino, and charged lepton, respectively. M is the invariant amplitude of this process. In above
equation we have summed over the polarizations of ﬁnal states.

2.1.1. Form Factors

factors t1 ∼ t4 has the same form with 1D2 just si replaced with ti. For the J = 3 meson, the
hadronic matrix element can be described by form factors h1 ∼ h4 as below

hc¯c|hµ

bc|Bci = eαβγP αP β(h1P γP µ + h2P γP µ

F + h3gγµ + ih4ǫµγP PF ),

where eαβγ is the polarization tensor for the meson with J = 3 [33]. The expressions of these form
factors are given in the next section.

where Ni are described by form factors si, ti or hi (see Appendix A). By using Eq. (6) and Eq. (7),
we can write LµνHµν as follow

LµνHµν = 8N1(cid:0)2P ·pℓP ·pν − M 2pν·pℓ(cid:1) + 16N2(P ·pℓPF ·pν + PF ·pℓP ·pν − pν·pℓP ·PF )

One can check that AF B has the same value for the decays of B+
c mesons. Its numerical
results are given in Section 4. The momentum spectrum of charged lepton in the semi-leptonic
decays is also an important quantity both experimentally and theoretically, which has the form

2.2. The Non-leptonic Decay

In this subsection, we will deal with the non-leptonic decays in the framework of factorization
approximation [34, 35] . The Feynman diagram of the non-leptonic decay of Bc meson is showed in
Fig. 2. In this work we only calculate the processes when X is π, ρ, K, or K ∗.

where c1(µ) and c2(µ) are the scale-dependent Wilson coeﬃcients. Ois are the relevant four-quark
local operators, which have the following forms

O1 = [Vud( ¯dαuα)V −A + Vus(¯sαuα)V −A](¯cβbβ)V −A,
O2 = [Vud( ¯dαuβ)V −A + Vus(¯sαuβ)V −A](¯cβbα)V −A,

(13)
(14)

where we have used the symbol (¯q1q2)V −A = ¯q1γµ(1 − γ5)q2; here α and β denote the color indices.
We will use the factorization approximation to calculate the non-leptonic Bc decays. The decay
amplitude is factorized as the product of two parts, namely, the hadronic transition matrix element
and an annihilation matrix element

3. Hadronic Matrix Element

In this Section we will calculate the hadronic matrix element using the BS method. According
bc|Bci can be directly

to Mandelstam formalism [37], the hadronic transition matrix element hc¯c|hµ

In the above expression, χ(P, q) and χ(PF , q′) stand for the BS wave functions of the Bc meson
and the ﬁnal charmonium, respectively; χ is deﬁned as γ0χ†γ0; q and q′ are respectively the inner
relative momenta of Bc and c¯c system, which are related to the quark (anti-quark) momentum p(′)

iPF + (−1)(i+1)q′ (i = 1, 2). Here we used the symbols
αi = mi
i are masses of the constituent quarks in the initial
and ﬁnal bound states, respectively (see Fig. 1). Here we have m1 = mb, m2 = m′
1 = mc. As
there is a delta function in the ﬁrst line of the above equation, the relative momenta q and q′ are
related by q′ = q − (α2P − α′
By using the instantaneous approximation [28], the BS interaction kernel does not depend on
the time component qP (= P · q/M) of the inner relative momentum q. After ﬁnishing the counter
integral over qP , we obtain [26]

In our calculation, the ﬁnal charmonium states are 1D2(2−+), 3D2(2−−), or 3D3(3−−). The Salpeter
wave functions are constructed by considering the spin and parity of the corresponding mesons [38].
We will take the 1D2(2−+) state as an example to show how to do the calculation and achieve form
factors. The results of other mesons will be given directly.

The general wave function of 1D2 states can be written as [39]

where η is the angle between q and pF .

Replacing the wave function ϕ++(1D2) by ϕ++(3D2) or ϕ++(3D3), and repeating the procedures
above, we can get the form factors for the transition of Bc to ψ2(13D2) or ψ3(13D3) charmonium. We

will not give the bulky analytical expressions but only present the form factors for the decays to 3D2
and 3D3 charmonia graphically (see Fig. 3).

4. Numerical Results and Discussions

By solving the Salpeter equations, we can get the wave functions of Bc, ηc2(11D2), ψ2(13D2), and
ψ3(13D3). For the interaction kernel we use the Cornell potential. The model parameters we used
are as before [39]. The Bc mass and lifetime are MBc = 6.276 GeV and τBc = 0.452 × 10−12 s [6].
The values of CKM matrix elements are Vbc = 0.041, Vud = 0.974, and Vus = 0.225. For the ψ2(13D2)
meson, which has been found experimentally to be X(3823) [1], it has the mass Mψ2 = 3.823 GeV.
For ηc2(11D2) and ψ3(13D3), we take their masses to be Mηc2 = 3.837 GeV and Mψ3 = 3.849 GeV [43],
respectively. Among the three D-wave charmonia we calculated here, ψ2(13D2) and ηc2(11D2) are
expected to be quite narrow since there are no open charm decay modes. Both of them are just
above the threshold of D ¯D while below D ¯D∗. However, the conservation of parity forbids the D ¯D
channel. So the dominant decay modes are expected to be electromagnetic ones. For ψ2(13D2), the
total width are estimated to be ∼ 0.4 MeV [41]. The predominant EM decay channel of this particle
is ηc2(11D2)→ hc(1P )γ, which is about 0.3 MeV [4, 42]. For ψ3(13D3), although its mass is above the
D ¯D threshold, the decay width is estimated to be less than 1 MeV [43, 44]. The reasons are that
the phase space is small and there is a F -wave centrifugal barrier. The radiative width for the main
EM transition ψ3(13D3)→γχc2 is ∼ 0.3 MeV.
In Fig. 3(a)∼ Fig. 3(c), we show the form factors si, ti and hi which change with (P − PF )2. To
make the form factors have the same dimension, we have divided s3, t3 and h3 by M 2
Bc. One can
see that for the J = 2 case, compared to the other three form factors, s3 and t3 change very slow as
(P − PF )2 increases. For ηc2, s1 and s2 are increasing functions, while s4 is a decreasing function.
For ψ2, t1 (t2 and t4) is decreasing (increasing) function. For the J = 3 case, namely, ψ3, h1 and
h3 (h2 and h4) are decreasing (increasing) functions. we can see that except ηc2, for which only one
form factor is negative, other two cases have two negative form factors, respectively. One also notices
these form factors are smooth enough. This is important for the calculation of non-leptonic decays,
which depends sensitively on one speciﬁc point of the form factors.

From the results of form factors, we can get the branching ratios of Bc exclusive decays. The
semi-leptonic decay widths of Bc to D-wave charmonia are list in Tab. I. Our result for the branching
ratio of the channel Bc→ψ2e¯νe is 1.5×10−4, which is larger than those of Refs. [8, 9] and Ref. [13]. For
the channel with τ as the ﬁnal lepton, our result is very close to that in Ref. [8], but more than two
times larger than those of Refs. [9, 13]. The method used in Ref. [13] is non-relativistic constituent
quark model. Both Ref. [8] and Ref. [9] used the same relativistic constituent quark model whose
framework is relativistic covariant while the wave functions of mesons are simply assumed to be the
Gaussian type. As to our method, although the instantaneous approximation leads to the lost of
part of the relativistic covariant, the wave functions are more reasonable. For the ηc2 and ψ3 cases,
we get B(Bc→ ηc2e¯νe) = 5.9 × 10−4 and B(Bc→ ψ3e¯νe) = 3.5 × 10−4 which are larger than that of
the ψ2 case. From this point, the former two channels have more possibilities to be detected in the
future experiments.

As an experimentally interested quantity, the numerical results for the forward-backward asym-
metry AF B are list in Tab. II. For the Bc→ ψ2ℓ¯ν channel, our results are consistent with those in
Ref. [13] but larger than those in Ref. [8]. We notice that for all the cases when ℓ = e, µ, and τ ,
AF B(ψ2) is negative. For the Bc → ηc2ℓ¯ν channel, when ℓ = e, AF B(ηc2) is negative, while for the
Bc → ψ3ℓ¯ν channel, when ℓ = e and µ, AF B(ψ3) is negative. For the absolute value of this quan-
tity, when ℓ = e, we have AF B(ηc2) < AF B(ψ3) < AF B(ψ2). For the sake of completeness, we also
plot Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 to show the spectra of decay widths varying along cos θ and 3-momentum |pℓ|
of the charged lepton, respectively. Here we do not give the result of µ mode which is almost the
same as that of ℓ = e. For the angular distribution in Fig. 4, we can see when ℓ = e, dΓ/(Γd cos θ)
decreases monotonously for ψ2 when cos θ varies from −1 to 1, but reaches the maximum value for ηc2
and ψ3 in the vicinity of 0. When ℓ = τ , all the three distributions are monotonic functions (for ηc2

and ψ3, the angular spectra are increasing functions, while for ψ2, it’s a decreasing function). As to
the momentum distribution (see Fig. 5), one can see the results of ηc2 and ψ3 are more symmetrical
than that of ψ2, especially for ℓ = e. These results will be useful to the future experiments.

The non-leptonic decay width of Bc to D-wave charmonia are list in Tab. III. In the calculation,
the decay constants of the charged mesons are fπ = 130.4 MeV, fK = 156.2 MeV [6], fρ = 210 MeV,
and fK ∗ = 217 MeV [9]. The factorization method is used and the decay widths are expressed with
Wilson coeﬃcients. In this paper we choose a1 = 1.14 [6]. The branching ratios of the non-leptonic
decays list in Tab. IV. For the channels with ψ2 as the ﬁnal charmonium, when the light meson is
pseudoscalar, the branching ratio is smaller than that of Ref. [9] but about 20 times larger than that
of Ref. [13]. While for the channels with vector charged mesons, the branching ratios are about 2
times and 5 times larger than those of Ref. [9] and Ref. [13], respectively. Within all non-leptonic
channels, those with ρ as the charged meson have the largest branching ratios, which have more
possibilities to be discovered by the future experiments.

5. Summary

In this work we calculated semi-leptonic and non-leptonic decays of Bc into the D-wave charmonia,
namely, ηc2(11D2), ψ2(13D2), and ψ3(13D3), whose decay widths are expected to be narrow. The
results show that for the semi-leptonic channels with the charged lepton to be e or µ, the branching
ratios are of order of 10−4. For the non-leptonic decay channels, the largest branching ratio is also of
order of 10−4. These results can be useful for the future experiments to study the D-wave charmonia.
