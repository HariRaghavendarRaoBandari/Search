Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most dynamic phenomena in our solar system. They abruptly disrupt the continuous
outﬂow of solar wind by expelling huge clouds of magnetized plasma into interplanetary space with velocities enabling
to cross the Sun-Earth distance within a few days. Earth-directed CMEs may cause severe geomagnetic storms when
their embedded magnetic ﬁelds and the shocks ahead compress and reconnect with the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The transit
times and impacts in detail depend on the initial CME velocity, size, and mass, as well as on the conditions and coupling
processes with the ambient solar wind ﬂow in interplanetary space. The observed CME parameters may be severly aﬀected
by projection eﬀects and the constant changing environmental conditions are hard to derive. This makes it diﬃcult to fully
understand the physics behind CME evolution, preventing to do a reliable forecast of Earth-directed events. This short
review focusing on observational data, shows recent methods which were developed to derive the CME kinematical proﬁle
for the entire Sun-Earth distance range as well as studies which were performed to shed light on the physical processes
that CMEs encounter when propagating from Sun to Earth.

1 Introduction

The initiation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can be de-
scribed as disrupted equilibrium, which becomes somehow
unstable and starts to erupt (for a recent review on CME
initiation models see e.g. Webb & Howard 2012). Due to
the successive stretching of magnetic ﬁeld lines magnetic
reconnection may set in, enabling fast as well as slow re-
conﬁguration processes (Forbes 2000). Slow magnetic re-
conﬁguration processes presumably dominate high up in the
corona launching so-called stealth CMEs (Robbrecht et al.
2009). The observed CME front is formed due to plasma-
pileup and compression of plasma (e.g., Ontiveros & Vourl-
idas 2009; Vourlidas et al. 2013). With peak acceleration
values of more than 600 m s−2 (for statistics see e.g., Bein
et al. 2011), CMEs abruptly disrupt the continuous outﬂow
of solar wind. Together with their embedded magnetic ﬁeld
(magnetized plasma clouds) and shocks ahead, CMEs prop-
agate into interplanetary (IP) space with velocities of a few
hundred to a few thousand km/s (e.g., Yashiro et al. 2004)
and may cause severe space weather eﬀects when inter-
acting with the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (see e.g., Pulkkinen
2007; Schwenn 2006, and references therein). Even ther-
mospheric responses in terms of a neutral density increase
are observed due to CME-Earth interactions (e.g., Guo et al.
2010; Krauss et al. 2015). The transit times to reach a dis-
tance of 1 AU is of about one to ﬁve days, and depends on
the CME’s initial velocity, size, and mass, as well as on the

conditions of the ambient solar wind ﬂow in IP space (see
e.g., Bothmer & Daglis 2007).

The measurement of characteristic CME parameters
such as speed, width, propagation direction, are usually
executed from single vantage points, hence, from obser-
vations projected onto the plane-of-sky (e.g., Hundhausen
1993). Therefore, all derived values are severely aﬀected
by projection eﬀects (see e.g., Burkepile et al. 2004; Cre-
mades & Bothmer 2004). Of special interest are halo CMEs,
i.e. CMEs propagating towards the observer especially at
Earth, that were subject to a large number of studies using
the coronagraphs aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Obser-
vatory launched in 1995 (SoHO; Brueckner et al. 1995).
The question arose whether halo CMEs would be diﬀer-
ent compared to limb CMEs (Chen 2011). Such questions
can only be answered when using multipoint observational
data, as from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
launched in 2006 (STEREO; Howard et al. 2008). In a re-
cent study Kwon et al. (2015) showed that halo CMEs do
not reﬂect the actual size of a CME but that of the fast shock
wave around the magnetic structure (cf. Figure 1). Using 3D
speeds from STEREO, the uncertainties in estimated arrival
times of CMEs could be decreased by up to a factor of two
compared to projected speeds as derived from single space-
craft data (e.g., Colaninno et al. 2013; Mishra & Srivastava
2013; Shi et al. 2015). In this respect, STEREO observa-
tions opened a new observational window and enabled for
the ﬁrst time to study in detail the consequences of projec-
tion eﬀects, and as such this could largely improve the un-
derstanding of CMEs.

2 Kinematic evolution of CMEs

Close to the Sun, the propelling Lorentz force, as a conse-
quence of magnetic reconnection (Chen 1989, 1996; Kliem
& T¨or¨ok 2006), triggers the CME. In IP space, it is the drag
acceleration owing to the ambient solar wind ﬂow that dom-
inates the propagation behaviour of a CME (e.g., Cargill
et al. 1996; Chen 1996; Vrˇsnak 1990). Figure 2 shows a
schematic view on the evolution of a CME (see also Figure 1
in Zhang & Dere 2006). According to studies by Zhang
et al. (2001, 2004), the kinematical evolution of CMEs is
divided into a three-phase scenario. The (1) CME initia-
tion starts with a slow rising motion of the duration of some
tens of minutes, followed by the (2) impulsive or major ac-
celeration phase, during which the maximum of accelera-
tion and speed is reached. The ﬁrst two phases clearly hap-
pen in the inner corona at distances below 2 Rs (St. Cyr
et al. 1999; Vrˇsnak 2001), where the maximum accelera-
tion peak is found below <0.5 Rs (Bein et al. 2011; Zhang
& Dere 2006). As most of CMEs are accompanied by ﬂares
(Yashiro et al. 2006), the energy release of ﬂares is an im-
portant parameter for better understanding the driving pro-
cess of CMEs, e.g. by measuring the high energetic hard X-
ray (HXR) ﬂux of CME associated ﬂares, it is found that the
HXR proﬁle is almost synchronized with the CME acceler-
ation phase indicating a ﬂare-CME feedback relation (Tem-
mer et al. 2010, 2008). During the (3) propagation phase
into IP space, the CME gets ﬁnally adjusted to the speed of
the ambient solar medium (e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2000).
In this respect the CME mass as well as its cross-section
(width) is an important parameter (e.g., Vrˇsnak et al. 2010),

Fig. 2
Schematic view on the dynamic evolution of a
CME with focus on the early evolution close to the Sun. The
energy release of the associated ﬂare as measured by the
hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂux is synchronized with the CME ac-
celeration phase, the measured soft X-ray ﬂux (SXR) goes
along with the CME speed until its maximum.

and using STEREO data the 3D mass can be calculated (see
Colaninno & Vourlidas 2009). From a statistical study, the
evolution of CME mass m can be described by Eq.1 which
shows that the CME mass depends on the observed height
h of the CME front, its initially ejected mass m0 (i.e., the
proper CME mass ejected from the low corona without oc-
culter eﬀect), and the size of the coronagraph occulter hocc
(Bein et al. 2013).

(cid:16)

1 − (hocc/h)3(cid:17)

m(h) = m0

+ ∆m(h − hocc)

(1)

From this an increase in CME mass is derived with
∆m(h)∼2%–6% within a height h=10–20 Rs and an ini-
tial CME mass of m0 = 1014g–1016g at a distance < 3 Rs.
These results have also important implications for studies
on global energetics of ﬂares and CMEs (see e.g., Emslie
et al. 2012).

2.1 The early evolution of CMEs

Only detailed height-time proﬁles covering the early evo-
lution of the CME close to the Sun enable us to study
the impulsive acceleration phase of a CME. To derive the
entire kinematical proﬁle of a CME, usually plane-of-sky
measurements are used from coronagraph data allowing
views to very low distances from the Sun (e.g., from Mauna
Loa observatory), or combined on-disk/oﬀ-limb, e.g., in the
EUV or SXR wavelength regime, and coronagraph observa-
tions (e.g., Temmer et al. 2008; Vrˇsnak et al. 2007b). Such
studies showed how low in the corona the maximum of
the CME acceleration peak is reached (see also Gallagher
et al. 2003; Zhang & Dere 2006). A further study using
STEREO observations to derive the 3D kinematical pro-
ﬁles of CMEs revealed that the CME reaches its maximum
acceleration typically below 2 Rs and that the acceleration

proﬁles of CMEs associated with prominences are diﬀerent
from those without (Joshi & Srivastava 2011). The statis-
tical study by Bein et al. (2011) demonstrated that CMEs
starting at lower heights also reach their peak acceleration
at lower heights and that CMEs that are accelerated at lower
heights reach higher peak accelerations (cf. Figure 3). A di-
rect consequence of lower CME initiation heights is that the
larger magnetic ﬁeld yields to a stronger Lorentz force and
shorter Alfv´en time scales making the acceleration process
more impulsive. Such a scenario is supported from the re-
sult that compact CMEs are accelerated more impulsively
(Vrˇsnak et al. 2007a). This clearly shows that characteristic
CME properties are set already low in the solar atmosphere.

2.2 Measuring CMEs in IP space

For large distances from the Sun (>30 Rs) the analysis of
CME observational data, e.g., using STEREO heliospheric
imagers, becomes more complicated. CMEs are extended
and optically thin objects, when observing them at large
distances from the Sun, the plane-of-sky assumption is not
valid anymore leading to a more complex treatment of ge-
ometry and Thomson scattering eﬀects (Howard & Tappin
2010). In order to derive the kinematical proﬁles of CMEs
covering the Sun-Earth distance range the measured elon-
gation needs to be converted into radial distance. Several
methods have been developed, either using single or multi-
ple spacecraft data, assuming that the CME has a radial out-
ward motion from the source region on the Sun and a cer-
tain front geometry (e.g., point-like, circular, elliptic). For
CMEs of small width we may use the ﬁxed-φ approxima-
tion (e.g., Rouillard et al. 2008; Sheeley et al. 1999). As
the method works poorly for wider CMEs (Kahler & Webb
2007; Rouillard et al. 2009), the Harmonic-Mean method
was proposed by Lugaz et al. (2009) and Howard & Tap-
pin (2009). Extensions to these methods were developed in-
troducing the fact that CMEs evolve in a self-similar man-
ner (SSE Davies et al. 2012; M¨ostl & Davies 2013). Other
stereoscopic reconstruction methods include Tangent-to-a-
sphere (TAS; Lugaz et al. 2010) or geometric triangulation
applied on Heliospheric Imager data (GT; Liu et al. 2010),
or 3D mask ﬁtting (Feng et al. 2012). A constraint to the
elongation measurements may be given by the additional
use of in-situ data, provided the CME is observed remotely
and in-situ (see e.g., Rollett et al. 2012).

The most important parameter for all of those methods
is the propagation direction of a CME. To derive this, a vast
amount of techniques was established using diﬀerent obser-
vational data sets from two or more vantage points by dif-
ferent spacecraft. Simple tools, as the tie-point reconstruc-
tion or triangulation are applied (e.g., Liu et al. 2009; Mal-
oney et al. 2009; Mierla et al. 2009; Temmer et al. 2009).
More sophisticated methods cover the forward ﬁtting of a
model CME to white light images (see Thernisien 2011;
Thernisien et al. 2006; Wood et al. 2009). By deriving the
CME mass from diﬀerent vantage points, also the 3D prop-
agation direction is obtained (Bein et al. 2011; Colaninno &

Vourlidas 2009). Another method applies polarization data
and ratio techniques (de Koning et al. 2009; Moran 2009).
In general, triangulation methods work better for distances
close to the Sun, since line-of-sight eﬀects are more eﬀec-
tive as the CME expands. A major drawback for most of
these methods is the a priori assumption of the CME ge-
ometry that needs to be applied, hence, errors in kinemat-
ics and direction may be large. Even polarization measure-
ments show large scatter when inﬂuenced by non-polarized
plasma material for e.g. the embedded ﬁlament (see Mierla
et al. 2009).

2.3 Eﬀects of the ambient environment on CME
propagation

The kinematical proﬁles, as derived with the methods de-
scribed afore, clearly revealed that the environmental con-
ditions in which a CME is embedded plays a major role
in the CME propagation behaviour (e.g., Manchester et al.
2004). Close to the Sun, eﬀects of the ambient magnetic
ﬁeld become evident as observational signatures of CME
rotation during which most probably an adjustment to the
ambient magnetic ﬁeld structure is taking place (see e.g.,
Panasenco et al. 2013; Vourlidas et al. 2011; Yurchyshyn
et al. 2009, 2001). Inﬂuences of magnetic ﬁeld pressure gra-
dients are also observed as longitudinal/latitudinal deﬂec-
tion, i.e. as non-radial outward motion of the CME when
observed close to the Sun (Bosman et al. 2012; Burkepile
et al. 1999; Byrne et al. 2010; Foullon et al. 2011; Mac-
Queen et al. 1986; M¨ostl et al. 2015). Further out in IP
space, the CME propagation is strongly dependent on the in-
teraction with the ambient solar wind (see recent studies by
e.g., Mays et al. 2015; Rollett et al. 2014; Savani et al. 2010;
Temmer et al. 2011) and the solar wind drag eﬀect becomes
dominant as CMEs which are faster than the solar wind, are
slowed down, and those that are slower get accelerated (e.g.,
Gopalswamy et al. 2001; Vrˇsnak & Gopalswamy 2002).

To interpret the kinematical evolution in IP space, the
analytical drag based model (DBM) is widely used (Vrˇsnak
et al. 2014; Vrˇsnak & ˇZic 2007; Vrˇsnak et al. 2013). The
drag acceleration is given by Eq. 2 with r the radial distance

of the CME leading edge and γ = cdAρSW/m. γ is the so-
called drag parameter depending on A the area of the CME
cross-section (as can be derived from 3D reconstructions),
ρSW the ambient density, m the CME mass and cd the dimen-
sionless drag coeﬃcient (for details see Cargill 2004). Due
to the fact that the background solar wind speed and density
may reveal strong gradients such as high speed solar wind
streams or other CMEs, the advanced version of the DBM
provides a distance dependent solar wind speed as well as
density, that can be adjusted to interpret strong changes in
the CME kinematics (see ˇZic et al. 2015).

The DBM shows that without knowing the spatial dis-
tribution of solar wind parameters, we may not be able to
fully understand the CME propagation behaviour and con-
sequently to forecast their arrival times and impact speeds at
certain distances in IP space. Taking into account the varia-
tions in solar activity, the CME occurrence rate ranges from
about 0.3 per day (solar minimum activity phase) to 4–5
per day (solar maximum activity phase) (e.g. St. Cyr et al.
2000). With transit times of the order of one to ﬁve days
and propagation speeds of about 500–3000 km/s, we may
expect especially during times of high solar activity, dom-
inating ﬂuctuations due to successive CME eruptions. This
preconditioning is a very important aspect and several well
observed events could be studied revealing that conditions
in IP space are subject to constant change and as such pro-
vide diﬀerent circumstances for every CME. For example,
it was found that CMEs ahead may “clear the way”, mak-
ing follow-up events super-fast (Liu et al. 2014; Temmer
& Nitta 2015). On the other hand, successive CMEs head-
ing towards similar directions, may merge and form com-
plex ejecta of single fronts (e.g., Burlaga et al. 2002; Gopal-
swamy et al. 2001; Wang & Sheeley 2002; Wu et al. 2007).
The CME-CME merging process is assumed to be re-
vealed in radio observations as strong enhancement in type
II bursts (see e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2001, 2002; Hillaris
et al. 2011; Kahler & Vourlidas 2014). The eﬀects of such
complex CME entities at Earth’s magnetosphere cover ex-
tended periods of negative Bz (e.g. Farrugia et al. 2006;
Wang et al. 2003) making such CMEs more geoeﬀective
and causing more intense geomagnetic storms compared
to isolated single events (e.g. Burlaga et al. 1987; Dum-
bovi´c et al. 2015; Farrugia et al. 2006; Xie et al. 2006).
Observational evidence for the interaction process itself is
hard, if not impossible, to derive e.g. the kinematical pro-
ﬁles from remote sensing data point out a strong decelera-
tion starting already hours before the actual CME leading
edges are observed to get merged. From this we can in-
fer that a transfer of momentum is taking place (see e.g.,
Farrugia & Berdichevsky 2004; Lugaz et al. 2009; Mariˇci´c
et al. 2014; Mishra & Srivastava 2015; Mishra et al. 2015).
An extremely well documented CME-CME interaction are
the events of August 1–2, 2010 which was studied in detail
by various authors (Harrison et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012;
Mart´ınez Oliveros et al. 2012; M¨ostl et al. 2012; Temmer

Fig. 4
Strong changes in the kinematical proﬁles at far

ues are derived for interacting CMEs (CME1=CME ahead,

gate further as entity. Adapted from Temmer et al. (2012).

et al. 2012). Recent results indicate that the interaction pro-
cess might be tightly related to the location of the magnetic
ﬂux rope, as the slower CME ahead actually presents an
MHD obstacle in terms of increased magnetic tension, den-
sity, and pressure as well as decreased speed. Since the mag-
netic ﬂux rope is usually covering a smaller area of the en-
tire CME-shock structure (e.g., Kwon et al. 2015), we ob-
serve a locally deformed frontal structure for those regions
where the ﬂux ropes interact, while other regions, mainly
the shock, may freely propagate (Temmer et al. 2014). In
conclusion, the observational data reveal only the conse-
quences of CME-CME interaction, that is not suﬃcient to
fully understand and describe the physics of the merging
process.

3 Summary and conclusions

Owing to the wealth of observational data from multiple
vantage points starting with the STEREO-era in 2006, CME
properties could be studied in more detail than before. From
the full CME kinematical proﬁles, covering in detail their
early evolution close to the Sun, it was found that CME
properties are set in the low corona. These initial CME prop-
erties (speed, acceleration) can be obtained from full-disk
observations (e.g., EUV, SXR), and are important parame-
ters to study, as they have an inﬂuence on the further propa-
gation behaviour in IP space, and as such, may serve as fore-
casting proxies (see e.g., Bein et al. 2012; Berkebile-Stoiser
et al. 2012; Temmer et al. 2008). Especially the ambient
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration controls the CME kinematics
close to Sun. The CME shape/directivity/speed might be es-
timated by large-scale magnetic ﬁeld reconstructions over-
lying the CME source region (see e.g., Thalmann et al.
2015). Therefore, reliably measuring the magnetic ﬁeld

characteristics in the corona from remote sensing data will
become the challenge for future missions.

The methods which were developed to derive the direc-
tion of motion of CMEs, deliver crucial input for calculat-
ing the radial distance and kinematical evolution of CMEs
in IP space from observational data. Using combined obser-
vational and model results, the evolution of CMEs can be
interpreted in terms of changes of the ambient solar wind
parameters. From this it is found that the CME characteris-
tics and the environmental conditions dominate the prop-
agation behaviour and actual transit times of CMEs. For
better understanding the physics behind the coupling pro-
cesses between CMEs and the ambient solar wind, spe-
cial focus and interest lies in CME-CME interaction events.
They are known to form complex magnetic structures pro-
ducing more strong geomagnetic eﬀects for Earth-directed
CMEs than isolated ones, and during times of enhanced so-
lar activity, CME-CME interaction may take place quite of-
ten, causing a preconditioning of IP space. Certainly, the
increase in magnetic tension forces due to the ﬂux rope in-
teraction plays a key role, and intensiﬁes the drag force of
the ambient ﬂow resulting in a strong deceleration of sub-
sequent CMEs. However, it is the lack of plasma and mag-
netic ﬁeld parameters at the site where the interaction takes
place that hinders us to get a more close insight into the
physical processes. The in-situ instruments aboard Solar Or-
biter, which will travel at close distances (<0.28 AU) to the
Sun and Solar Probe Plus, approaching the Sun as close as
∼10 Rs (both planned to be launched end 2018) will be of
major interest and might give a complementary view on the
CME-CME merging processes. More detailed CME-CME
interaction studies may greatly improve the modeling of the
propagation behaviour of CMEs in IP space.

The constant change and incomplete knowledge of the
background conditions to which CMEs are exposed, pre-
vent a major improvement in space weather forecasting. In
this respect, models may need a permanent update in al-
most real-time to simulate the actual solar wind conditions
in IP space, ﬁnally enabling us to reliably forecast the arrival
times and impact speeds of CMEs at Earth.
