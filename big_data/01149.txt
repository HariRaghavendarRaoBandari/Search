Abstract

We consider Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group and present a com-
plete non-perturbative evaluation of the path integral (the partition function and
certain expectation values of Wilson loops) on Seifert ﬁbred 3-Manifolds. We use
the method of Abelianisation.
In certain cases the path integral can be seen to
factorize neatly into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts. We obtain closed
formulae of this factorization for the expectation values of torus knots.

1 Introduction

Chern-Simons theory with a complex gauge group GC (viewed as a complexiﬁcation of
some compact gauge group G) has been under study since it was ﬁrst considered in
[31]. Formal aspects of gauge ﬁxing for semi-simple gauge groups appeared in [2] and
a Hamiltonian version of quantization appears in [11]. In the case of GC = SL(2, C)
Chern-Simons theory appears as a gravitational theory in three dimensions [32, 17] in
ﬁrst order formalism. The ‘volume conjecture’ which relates certain (limits of) quantum
knot invariants to the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement [20, 24] renewed
interest in complex Chern-Simons theory. This is mainly for hyperbolic manifolds (or
knots).

Rather more recently the 3d-3d correspondence [15] and [12, 13] has revived the study
of Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group and in particular requires one to
know the partition function on manifolds which are not necessarily hyperbolic. Short of
having an ab initio derivation, many of the results are in fact conjectural and are used
to test, rather than to prove the veracity of, the proposed correspondence.

In the study of the quantum theory canonical quantization of the complexiﬁed theory
has its diﬃculties. The phase space is the symplectic manifold of ﬂat GC connections on
a Riemann surface Σ up to gauge transformations. That moduli space has the standard
description

MC(Σ) = Hom(π1(Σ), GC)/AdGC

(1.1)

As explained by Witten [31], rather than quantizing this non-compact space,one alter-
native is to consider instead the space of ﬂat G connections, up to gauge equivalence,

M(Σ) = Hom(π1(Σ), G)/AdG

(1.2)

and square integrable sections of a pre-quantum line bundle over this space. Dealing
directly with the quantization of (1.1) has been pushed forward in [14] and in particular
in [18], where an integral grading of the inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space into ﬁnite
dimensional subspaces has been given.

One of our aims here is to instead perform the path integral directly (foregoing the
canonical procedure completely). In a series of papers we have evaluated the Chern-
Simons partition function with compact and simply connected gauge group on (and
invariants for certain links in) Seifert ﬁbered 3-manifolds [6, 7, 8] (by a suitable gauge
ﬁxing and pushing the problem down to a 2-dimensional Abelian gauge theory). While
we have applied these ideas to three dimensional BF theory [32, 5] in [7, 10] we have
not dealt with the complex case.

The computations that we perform are for Seifert 3-manifolds and Seifert manifolds are
never hyperbolic. There are, however, advantages to this choice of 3-manifold. For the
most part the situation here is vastly simpliﬁed as (with suitable gauge ﬁxing) almost all

1

of the path integrals that we encounter are Gaussian (with sources). The ﬁnal answer
for the partition function with complex gauge group takes a very simple form (7.6) as
an integral over the complex Cartan subalgebra and a summation whose range depends
on the order |d| of H1(M, Z),

(1.3)

The integrand involves the Ray-Singer torsion (cid:98)τM of the 3-manifold with connections

in the complexiﬁed group and the exponent I n(t, t) is a polynomial of degree two in
the integration variables. The complex parameter t = k + is is the complex ‘level’ or
coupling constant of the theory. The circle V -bundle of the line V -bundle L over S2
with N orbifold points is the 3-manifold M in question. Note that (1.3) is very similar
to (a square of) the general formula given [22], except that we have an integral rather
than a sum to perform over one of the factors. The continuous variable reﬂects the
non-compact nature of the gauge group.

Another motivation for this work is to understand the holomorphic factorization of GC
Chern-Simons theory [33]. The path integral under consideration may be written as

(cid:90)

(cid:0)itI(C ) + itI(C )(cid:1)

Z[M, t, t] =

DC DC e

(1.4)

where the overline indicates complex conjugation. The natural question is how close are
we to being able to make sense of a factorization of the path integral into holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic parts

Z[M, t, t] ?= Z[M, t] . Z[M, t]

(1.5)

where

(cid:90)

Z[M, t] =

DC e (itI(C ))

and

Z[M, t] =

(cid:90)

(cid:0)itI(C )(cid:1)

DC e

and if such partition functions are to make sense what ‘contour’ path integrals are being
performed on the right hand side? It turns out that around a given ﬂat connection (1.5)
holds in perturbation theory.
In [16], equation (1.6), and [33], equation (2.27), it is
shown that the correct formula is

n(ρ, ρ) Zρ[M, t] . Zρ[M, t]

(1.6)

Z[M, t, t] =

1
|W|

(cid:88)

ρ,ρ

for some numbers n(ρ, ρ), where ρ labels the solution to the ﬂatness equation, and for
particular contours. We will discuss below, under which circumstances and in which
sense our exact non-perturbative result (1.3) displays this holomorphic factorization.

In the next section we introduce Chern-Simons theory with a complex gauge group
proper, taking it to be the complexiﬁcation GC of a compact gauge group G. There

2

we point out that there exists a symmetry of the path integral under the exchange

t ↔(cid:98)t which in part motivates holomorphic factorization. Various formal limits of the

coupling constants k and s are considered in section 3. These limits allow us to get
an understanding of what may be gleaned from allowing for a complex gauge group.
Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to our choice of gauge and choice of manifold. We note
that the choice of gauge is unitary and so avoids the pitfalls outlined in [2] of the more
usual Lorentz gauge.

In section 6 we integrate out the ﬁbre dependence of all the ﬁelds leaving us with an
eﬀective two dimensional Abelian gauge theory (6.15). This theory can also be seen
to formally factorize into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components and we see
that the Ray-Singer torsion enjoys this factorization. In section 7 we integrate all non-
constant modes in the two dimensional theory to be left with the ﬁnite dimensional
integral (1.3). This integral is such that the integrand factorises into holomorphic and
anti-holomorphic parts itself and so we have been able to follow the factorization at
each step of the evaluation of the path integral. In particular for (1.3) factorization, at
least for certain M , is based upon the fact that the following integral
− d2
4b

− c2
4a

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:90)

(1.7)

may be expressed as the product of two contour integrals (not closed contours)

d2z exp(cid:0)az2 + bz2 + cz + dz(cid:1) =
dz exp(cid:0)az2 + cz(cid:1) .

e (−iπ/2) .

(cid:90)

exp

π√−ab
(cid:90)
dz exp(cid:0)bz2 + dz(cid:1)

(1.8)
for example with both Γ and Γ(cid:48) being the real axis. These last formulae immediately
imply that the ‘holomorphic’ factor of the GC theory is just the partition function of
the G theory (at least up to framing and a change of level) once we sum over n.

Γ(cid:48)

Γ

Given that we have established factorization the question of what we are summing
over (or what does n represent geometrically) arises. In section 8, by comparing with
expectations of the s → ∞ limit, we are also able to show that, at least in that limit,
the sum is over particular ﬂat Abelian connections. At least for the Lens spaces this is
in keeping with the expectations of [16, 14, 33].

While one can perform the integral (1.3) exactly (we have done it for the Lens spaces)
it is instructive to use the factorization formula (1.8) to evaluate the holomorphic and
anti-holomorphic parts separately. As expected, up to framing dependent phases and a
shift in the level, these calculations agree for GC = SL(2, C) with those of the partition
function SU (2). We perform the calculations on M (n, 0, (a1, b1), (a2, b2)) (Seifert man-
ifolds with N = 2 orbifold points on the base S2) giving a redundant (diﬀeomorphic)
description of large numbers of Lens spaces in section 9. This description allows us to
evaluate the expectation values of Torus knots (in S3, though it is also just as easy to
evaluate them in Lens spaces).
Somewhat less obvious is factorization for Seifert manifolds with N ≥ 3 exceptional
ﬁbres. We do not claim to have shown this, though (1.3) holds. However, in the s → ∞

3

limit holomorphic factorization holds (with the holomorphic theory being a kind of
‘square root’ of BF theory).

For the future, we note that the techniques used here can equally well be used to evaluate
the partition functions and observables in Yang-Mills theory with complex gauge group
and the GC/GC model (at least on S2) and for supersymmetric theories.

2 Complex Chern-Simons Theory

Let G denote a simple and simply connected compact Lie group and let GC be its
complexiﬁcation. Consider a 3-manifold M and the trivial GC bundle over it PC =
M × GC. Let AC be the aﬃne space of connections on PC. The Chern-Simons action
is,

I(t,(cid:98)t) =

for C ∈ AC and with t,(cid:98)t ∈ C (but not necessarily complex conjugates). The over-

line indicates minus Hermitian conjugation (which is the same as complex conjugation
within the trace). We may write

C = A + iB, A , B ∈ Ω1(M, Lie G)

(2.2)

where both A and B are anti-Hermitian. Under this split the action becomes

I(k, s) =

A ∧ dA +

A ∧ A ∧ A − B ∧ dA B

(cid:19)

where t = k + is,(cid:98)t = k − is. We let I denote the Chern-Simons action for the compact

(2.4)
As the exponential of the action should be invariant under G ⊂ GC transformations we
must have that k ∈ Z, however, this imposes no constraint on s ∈ C. Unitarity of the
theory is another issue. As explained in [31] unitarity for a Euclidean theory amounts
to requiring that the argument of the path integral under a change orientation is the
same as complex conjugation. Consequently, on putting the manifold dependence in

I(t,(cid:98)t) (2.1),

− I(M, t,(cid:98)t) = I(−M, t,(cid:98)t)

There are two choices for s which lead to a unitary theory [31]:

4

1. s ∈ R with C −→ C under orientation reversal or
2. s ∈ iR and under a reversal of orientation C −→ C

The unitary theory that we consider here is the one where s ∈ R so that(cid:98)t = t.
2.1 A Symmetry t ↔(cid:98)t
an interchange of t ↔(cid:98)t. This transformation is independent of the unitarity conditions
just described. The interchange t ↔(cid:98)t amounts to saying that the theory is invariant

We note that by simply sending B → −B in (2.2) we are exchanging C ↔ C so that the
theory (providing one’s regularization preserves this transformation) is invariant under

under s → −s.

3 Various Limits

One may get a feel for what the invariants are by taking various limits of the parameter
s that appears in the theory. This provides some intuition for the formal structure of the
theory. For the rest of this section the 3-manifold M is taken to be a rational homology
sphere (QHS), H1(M, Q) = 0, so that the moduli space of ﬂat GC connections is a set of
isolated points. M being a QHS means that we do not have to worry about zero modes
associated with ﬂat directions in the path integral.

3.1 The s −→ 0 Limit

A potential source of zero modes are solutions to the equations

dA B = 0

(3.1)

however, by our choice of M , we do not have to confront solutions to this equation
about a ﬂat connection A . This means that I(k, 0) is a perfectly good action in this
case. Performing the Gaussian Integration over B (including gauge ﬁxing) gives, up to
a phase,

(cid:112)τM (A )

(3.2)

where τM is the Ray-Singer torsion on M of the given ﬂat connection. The phase that
one gets from this path integral exactly compensates that that one would get on a
perturbative evaluation of the path integral over A [2].

While it is pleasing to see the Ray-Singer Torsion (3.2) arise, its presence in a non-
perturbative treatment of the path integral complicates matters. The argument of the
torsion in general is not a ﬂat connection and the integral over the space of G connections
A now has its measure given by (3.2) which is in principle very complicated.

3.2 The s −→ ∞ Limit
To ensure that exp (iI(k, s)) does not oscillate wildly as s −→ ∞ we also scale

B −→ B/s

Then the leading terms in the action become

which is a combination of BF and Chern-Simons theories. Had we kept higher order
terms in 1/s we would have been able to develop a perturbation theory in this limit.
Formally, the measure of the theory in this limit together with the scaling (up to π

factors) goes as(cid:89)

for i some complete basis indexing set of the forms that appear in the path integral.
This is not quite right, as we have not taken the volume of the gauge group into account.
A correct analysis will require us to multiply the measure by a factor so that the right
hand limit in (3.4) is what one obtains. One can see the problem directly in (1.3) where
the proposed limit always gives zero. We will come back to this in Section 8.

Notice that for consistency in this limit we need also to make the Wigner-In¨on¨u group
contraction

GC → IG

(3.5)

The path integral is straightforward to perform and, at least formally, one obtains that
the partition function is

Z(k,∞) =

exp (ikI(A )) . τM (A )

(3.6)

(cid:88)

where M is the moduli space of ﬂat G connections on M . One can do better and also
formally evaluate the expectation value of Wilson loops of the G connection A ,

(3.7)

In section 9 of [7] and in [10] we were able to evaluate the path integral explicitly for
certain Seifert manifolds (for example the computation gives the explicit form of the
Ray-Singer torsion for each ﬂat connection). One may also obtain explicit expressions
with the insertion of Wilson loops which wrap along the ﬁbre of M and the class of Wil-
son loops include those involving B with ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensional representations
[10].

Before leaving this example we note that there is no extra phase arising from performing
the Gaussian integrals in this limit. This is completely in line with the observations of
Bar-Natan and Witten [2].

6

3.3 The k −→ 0 Limit
The k −→ 0 limit greatly simpliﬁes the action of the ﬁnite dimensional theory that we
arrive at, as one can see in (8.3).
This limit is interesting from the gravitational view point as, if one considers B to be a
(possibly singular) dreibein, the action is that of gravity with a cosmological constant
[32]. Predominantly, the manifolds of current interest for applications to quantum
gravity are non-compact and require considerations like boundary conditions, an issue
we do not discuss here. However, there is also, via the 3d-3d correspondence at k = 0
[26], a relationship between complex Chern-Simons theory and the superconformal index
of an associated 3d N = 2 theory. This comparison requires one to take s purely
imaginary and thus requires us to analytically continue our results to that regime.

4 Contact 3-Manifolds and Gauge Conditions

Technically we will need to make use of two facts having to do with gauge ﬁxing. The
ﬁrst fact is that one can impose that the component φ of the connection C along the ﬁbre
direction of the Seifert manifold can be gauge ﬁxed to be constant along the ﬁbre. The
second fact is that one may then, at a price, conjugate φ into a Cartan sub-algebra of the
Lie algebra of the compact group [9]. Once the gauge ﬁxing has been performed one ﬁnds
that the evaluation can be pushed down to a problem in two dimensional Abelian gauge
theory. One decomposes the connection in terms of Fourier modes (along the ﬁbre)
and then one integrates over all the massive Fourier modes of the connection leaving
an eﬀective theory on the (orbifold) base. Obviously the integration over the inﬁnite
number of Fourier components of the connection requires its own set of techniques.

To set notation we let g be the Lie algebra of the compact group G, t a Cartan subalgebra
and k the complement to t in g,

g = t ⊕ k

(4.1)

Likewise the complexiﬁcation of g, gC, is then the Lie algebra of GC and we let tC be
the complexiﬁcation of t so that we have

gC = tC ⊕ kC

(4.2)

All 3-manifolds admit a contact structure, that is M can be equipped with a globally
deﬁned one-form κ such that κ∧dκ (cid:54)= 0. When M is considered to be a contact manifold
(M, κ),(and M now not necessarily a QHS), there is a natural decomposition of the
tangent bundle and consequently of the cotangent bundle so that we may decompose
connections as

A = A + κ φ, B = B + κ λ .

(4.3)

7

Given a contact structure one also has a Reeb vector ﬁeld K such that

ιKκ = 1,

ιKdκ = 0

(4.4)

When M is Seifert 3-manifold we take κ to be the connection 1-form and K the generator
of S1 on M .

Given this decomposition (4.3) the action becomes

κ ∧ Tr(cid:2)−A ∧ LφA + B ∧ LφB − 2λ dAB + 2φ dA + dκ(cid:0)φ2 − λ2(cid:1)(cid:3)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

Furthermore, we also impose the conditions that along the ﬁbre the connection is in the
Cartan subalgebra of GC,

ιKC kC = 0 ⇒ φk = 0, λk = 0

(4.9)

We will impose these conditions in a unitary manner. Let D be a gC-valued 0-form and
add to the action

(cid:90)

M

Tr(cid:2)D ∗ ιKdιKC + D ∗ ιKdιKC(cid:3)

as Lagrange multiplier ﬁelds imposing (4.8). Notice that this is a real choice and that
the components of D that do not depend on the ﬁbre direction of M do not enter. We
let E and F be gC-valued 0-form ghost ﬁelds, so that the ghost action becomes

As long as we agree to not include LK zero modes we may simplify the ghost action to,

We also want to impose that the now constant ﬁelds lie in the Cartan subalgebra. We
use the constant kC part of D to do that,

(cid:90)

Tr(cid:2)D ∗ C + D ∗ C(cid:3)

(4.13)

M

The ghost terms are then correctly incorporated in (4.12) where we understand that the
only components of the ghosts which do not appear are those constant along the ﬁbre
and simultaneously take values in the Cartan subalgebra.

5 Seifert Rational Homology Spheres

The 3-manifolds of interest are circle V -bundles over 2 dimensional orbifolds Σ of genus
g -shortly we will ﬁx on the base being P1 with N orbifold points. The Seifert manifold
is written as M [deg L, g, (a1, b1), . . . , (aN , bN )] where the ai are the isotropies of the
orbifold points, the bi are the weights of the line V -bundle at the orbifold points and
deg L is the degree of that line bundle. The local model at each orbifold point, for the
associated line V-bundle, is

(z, w) (cid:39) (ζ.z, ζ b.w),

ζ a = 1

(5.1)
The Seifert manifold is smooth if gcd(ai, bi) = 1 for each i. It is an ZHS iﬀ the line
bundle L0 that deﬁnes it satisﬁes

c1(L0) = ±

1

g = 0,

(5.2)
one consequence of these conditions is that gcd(ai, aj) = 1 for i (cid:54)= j. If one takes a
tensor power of this line V-bundle, L⊗d
c1(L⊗d

then the Seifert manifold is a QHS with
0 ) = ±

g = 0,

(5.3)

a1 . . . aN

and

|d| = |H1(M, Z)|

(5.4)

We want to make contact with the L(p, q) notation used for Lens spaces. It is a theorem
that all Seifert manifolds satisfying (5.3) with N ≤ 2 are Lens spaces (see [25] page 99).
Indeed all Seifert manifolds satisfying (5.2) with N ≤ 2 are S3. Fix N = 2 and recall
that for a Lens space L(p, q) the order of the ﬁrst integral homology group is |p| so that
we may identify p with d in (5.3). This gives us a formula, namely

Let r and s be integers satisfying ra1 − s(na1 + b1) = 1 then

q = ra2 − sb2

6 Calculation of the Determinants

The calculation of the ratio of the determinants in the GC theory is very similar to
that for gauge group G [8]. We will concentrate mostly on the diﬀerences with that
exposition.

The ratio of determinants that we wish to evaluate is, see (5.5) of [8],

while the ghost operator is

H (M, k) ⊗ Ω1

H (M, k)

and neither of these are diagonal, though both are Hermitian. As usual we decompose
the space of forms into modes along the circle direction as

Ω1

H (M, k) =

Ω1(Σ, L⊗n ⊗ Vk), Ω0(M, k) =

Ω0(Σ, L⊗n ⊗ Vk),

(6.4)

(cid:77)

(cid:77)

and we also decompose the charge space into roots

Vk = ⊕αVα

(6.5)

On expanding the ﬁelds A and B in terms of Fourier modes and charges (concentrating
on those that take values in the complement of the Cartan subalgebra) we may write
the operators in matrix form as

∗κ ∧ i(cid:98)L(φ, λ)

(cid:32)

the factor of (k2+s2)−1/2 is there so that the measure for the ﬁelds is simply(cid:81)

k(n + iα(φ)) − siα(λ)
−s(n + iα(φ)) − kiα(λ)
−s(n + iα(φ)) − kiα(λ) −k(n + iα(φ)) + siα(λ)

however, there is still a factor of

Given an operator T one may deﬁne the absolute value of its determinant following [30]

to take their square. The matrix square of (6.6) is

(cid:2)(n + iα(φ))2 + (iα(λ))2(cid:3) . I2×2
(cid:2)(n + iα(φ))2 + (iα(λ))2(cid:3) . I2×2

where I2×2 is the two by two identity matrix and the matrix square of (6.8) is

Though these last two expressions appear to be the same one must recall that they act
on diﬀerent spaces of forms. Nevertheless, they may be ‘holomorphically factorized’ as

[n + iα(φ) + α(λ)] . [n + iα(φ) − α(λ)] . I2×2

(6.11)

Following through the same reasoning as presented in section 5 of [8] we ﬁnd that the
absolute value of the ratio of determinants (6.1) is simply

(cid:112)τM (φ + iλ, a1, . . . , aN ) .(cid:112)τM (φ − iλ, a1, . . . , aN )

Incidentally, this calculation implies that the Ray-Singer torsion for non-unitary ﬂat

connections,(cid:98)τM , factorises holomorphically, at least for these Seifert manifolds and for

these particular Abelian connections.

We have not explicitly calculated the phase of the determinants but one way to see that
there is no overall phase correction is to note that both matrices (6.6) and (6.8) are
traceless. Being traceless means that the two eigenvalues are of the same absolute value
but with the opposite sign and so cancel each others contribution in the evaluation of
the η invariant.

Having integrated out all the non-zero modes in the S1 direction of M and all those
zero modes in the kC part of the Lie algebra, we are left with an Abelian theory on the
orbifold base of the ﬁbration,

The sum over rank(G) U (1) bundles is there to take into account the non-triviality of
the Abelian gauge ﬁxing, so that A is a connection on a product of trivial line bundles
over Σ. We have not speciﬁed the range of the summation as that depends on the choice
of 3-manifold. In the next section we will pick a certain class of 3-manifolds.

Notice that the form of (6.15) with action (6.17) still suggests a ‘holomorphic’ factor-

We could have included a phase factor that only depends on the gauge group and on
the 3-manifold M in the deﬁnition of the holomorphic partition function -providing it
cancels against a similar phase from the anti-holomorphic partition function.

7 Finite Dimensional Integrals

At this point we must make an assumption about the 3-manifold M . The Abelian theory
(6.15) has zero modes in that elements B ∈ H1(Σ, it) do not appear in the argument of
the path integral. There are also A zero modes but large gauge transformations would
ensure that they are compact directions. To avoid this issue we assume that the genus
of Σ is zero.

With this assumption the path integral (6.15) can be simpliﬁed further on noting that
integration over A and A imply that dΦ = 0.

(7.3)

under

Φ −→ Φ + 2πirP, n −→ n + dr

(7.4)
and provided that Tr (r r) ∈ 2Z the exponential in (7.1) is invariant under these trans-

formations. On taking P = (cid:81) ai the Ray-Singer torsion (cid:98)τM is also invariant under

(7.4). These transformations correspond to shifts by the integral lattice I of t (not the
complexiﬁed integral lattice for which there is no such invariance).

One should also consider the action of the Weyl group which acts naturally on t as well
as on tC. This is a symmetry of ﬁnite dimensional theory as it is part of the (ungauged)
gauge group. On quotienting out by these residual invariances we have either of two
formulae. One by using the symmetry to reduce the integrals to tC/I (cid:111) W , the other to
restrict the range of the summation. Consequently,

and there is either a restriction on the range of summation or on the integration. We
could have also introduced a phase into the deﬁnition, but prefer not to. This has
consequences for the interpretation of the factorization formula as we will see. The
contour tΓ needs to be deﬁned. In the case of Lens spaces one may take it to be tΓ = t.

The Ray-Singer Torsion τM (Φ) (6.13) diverges at the zeros of the sine function (6.14)
when the number of orbifold points is such that N +2g > 2. This means that the torsion

(cid:98)τM will also have poles. The zeros of sin (x + iy) are at (x, y) = (mπ, 0) for m ∈ Z.

If one ﬁrst makes use of the symmetry (7.4) to restrict the range of integration of Φ,
actually of φ, then the integrals to be performed over φ range from over −πP ≤ φ ≤ πP
for each component in the Cartan subalgebra. The sum over the integers n then implies
that kφ − sλ = rπ for r ∈ Zrk. The singularities occur at (φ, λ) = (mπ, 0) whence at
φ = rπ/k = mπ so that the divergences are at k|r. For compact gauge group G the
divergences are at (k + cg)|r (but we do not see the shift in the level in GC). We may
give the charged gauge ﬁelds (those in the orthocomplement of tC) a small mass while
preserving the maximal torus symmetry of the action. As for Chern-Simons theory with
compact gauge group G this means that at λ = 0 we have the ratio

sin2 (iα(φ))/ sinN (iα(φ) + )

(7.12)

which is non-singular on the walls, indeed vanishes there.

8 Summing over Flat Connections

A comparison of (7.8) with our formula for compact G (6.2) in [8] shows that we have

ZG[M, k] =

(8.2)

In passing to (8.1) one is losing some information as t is a Gauss integer, so it has
integral real part, while 2(k + cg) is even.

The summation in the factorization formulae is over an integer which, presently, appears
to have no geometric signiﬁcance from the point of view of the original theory. Here
we will show that, quite miraculously, the summation is at least in a limit over certain

14

ﬂat connections. To establish this relationship we will need to take a closer look at the
large s limit.
In components the action of the ﬁnite dimensional integral for any Seifert QHS M is

I n(t, t) = Tr [(kφ − sλ)in] + c1(L) Tr

(φ2 − λ2) − s
2π

φλ

4π

In order to compare with the large s limit of Section 3 we must scale λ −→ λ/s in which
case the action goes over to

I n(t, t) −→ Tr [(kφ − λ)in] + c1(L) Tr

φ2 − 1
2π

φλ

4π

Unfortunately, the scaling multiplies the integral with a prefactor of |s|−rk(G), which in
the limit means that the path integral vanishes. In order to pass to the BF theory we
must multiply the path integral by |c1(L⊗d
0 )s|rk(G) and we presume that this has been
done.

This scaling also turns the argument of the Ray-Singer Torsion from Φ to φ,

(cid:98)τ 1/2
M (Φ) −→ τM (φ)

(8.5)

As λ now only appears in the action (8.4), the integral over λ imposes the condition

c1(L⊗d

0 ) φ = −2πin

that is

φ = 2πin

P

as a delta function constraint. In this way we obtain for the partition function

(8.6)

Some things about this result requires comment. Note that we do not attempt to
sum over ﬂat connections at all, yet the ﬁnal sum may be interpreted as that over ﬂat
Abelian connections. We have introduced a sum over non-trivial U (1) bundles in (6.17)
which may be viewed as arising from background connections with values in the Cartan
subalgebra of G which are Yang-Mills connections (that is they satisfy the Yang-Mills
equations) with the explicit connection being

A = 2πP

n
d

κ, FA = 2πnω and dA ∗ FA = 0

(8.8)

As explained by Atiyah and Bott [1] section 6 and, in a version closer to our needs, in
section 5 of Beasley and Witten [4] there is a close relationship between the space of ﬂat
connections on M a circle bundle over Σ and Yang-Mills connections on Σ. To explain

15

N(cid:89)

(cid:19)

N(cid:89)

this we need the generators and relations deﬁning the various fundamental groups. As
M is a QHS the generators of π1(M ), ci, i = 1, . . . , N and h satisfy

[ci, h] = 1,

caj
j hbj = 1, and

cj = hn

(8.9)

j=1

clearly h is central and when h = 1 these relations reproduce those of the fundamental
group of the orbifold Σ. Yang-Mills connections on Σ correspond to having a central
extension of the fundamental group according to [1], while in [4] it is noted that as

1 −→ Z −→ π1(M ) −→ π1(Σ) −→ 1

(8.10)

that the extra generator h in π1(M ) then provides that extension. In turn the Yang-Mills
connection (8.8) provides us with a representation of the extension h

Given an m-dimensional representation,

S1

ρ : π1 (M (n, 0, (a1, b1), . . . (aN , bN ))) −→ GLm(F)

(8.12)

the Reidemeister torsion for a Seifert manifold M is given by [21] (see Lemma 4.3 there
and note our deﬁnition of the torsion is the inverse of the one used there)

τM (ρ) = det (ρ(h) − I)2−N

det (ρ(hsicri

i ) − I)

where

i=1

aisi − biri = 1

(8.13)

(8.14)

Our representation (8.11) is into the diagonal matrices so that by (8.14) and the homo-
topy relations (8.9) we have that

ρ(hsicri

i ) = ρ(h)si−ribi/ai = ρ(h)1/ai

(8.15)

so that

(cid:89)

τM (ρ) =

4 sin (2πP α(r)/d)2−N

N(cid:89)

(8.16)

We are, therefore, able to understand the partition function (8.7) as being given by a
sum over ﬂat connections as required by (3.6), however, not a sum over all possible
ﬂat connections but rather over a class of Abelian ﬂat connections. To complete the
comparison we also note that the exponent in (8.7) is just the evaluation of the Chern-
Simons action on the ﬂat connection of interest.

16

In summary one interprets the summation as being over Abelian connections for all
allowed M then (1.6) holds where the representations ρ arise from very special ﬂat
connections, namely those that are Abelian, are in the Cartan subalgebra of G and
correspond to the generator h. For such ρ we would then also have that n(ρ,ρ) = 1,
and that the factors Zρ
M [t] are, in some way, the complex Chern-Simons theory exactly
evaluated about our preferred Abelian connection. In the following section we show in
which sense that this is the case for Lens spaces.

9 Some Calculations on L(p, q) with GC = SL(2, C)

In this section we will derive some exact formulae for the partition function on L(p, q)
with complex gauge group SL(2, C). A bit further on we consider the expectation
value of some knots too. These calculations allow one to see the explicit dependence
on framing. We represent these Lens spaces as Seifert manifolds either with one or two
exceptional ﬁbres.

3-manifold, M (n, 0, (a1, b1), (a2, b2)) with n chosen so that c1 = ±1/a1a2. The standard
Hopf ﬁbration corresponds to a1 = a2 = 1, b1 = b2 = 0 and n = ±1. As r = 0 we have
a very simple integral to perform indeed. By writing the product of the sine functions
as sums of exponentials we arrive at

where q = a and p = na + b ([25] page 99). That is we let (a1, b1) = (1, 0) and

Notice that this expression is not necessarily invariant under r → r + p. Apart from
a phase and an overall factor related to the order of the Weyl group this expression
does, however, compare favourably with that of Jeﬀrey [19] Theorem 3.4. on taking
t = 2(k + 2).

As we have the explicit s dependence of the path integral in terms of known functions
we may extend the formulae to the complex s plane.

9.2

Inclusion of Knots

There is great advantage in having diﬀerent ﬁbrations represent the same topological
space. Given a Seifert ﬁbred 3-manifold the ﬁbre over a regular point of the base is a
Torus knot Ka1, a2. The type of Torus knot depends on the choice of ﬁbration. This
means that Wilson loops in the vertical direction can be invariants for diﬀerent knots
in the same manifold by changing the ﬁbration. This approach was used by Beasley
in [3] in a study of Chern-Simons theory with knot invariants within the context of
non-Abelian localisation. In a ﬁnite dimensional representation R, the possible Wilson

Once we have diagonalised then path ordering is no longer required and, with the
Cartan subalgebra being made up of diagonal matrices, such traces are just ﬁnite sums
of exponentials of Φ or Φ. For example if we ﬁx on GC = SL(2, C) then in a, ﬁnite

evaluate expectation values of products of Wilson loops, at least in the case of Lens
spaces.
As before, for simplicity, we ﬁx on GC = SL(2, C) and on S3. We consider Torus
knots of the form Ka1, a2 and to do so we consider S3 to be given by the Seifert ﬁbration
M (n, 0, (a1, b1), (a2, b2)) while ensuring that the ﬁrst Chern class of the ﬁbration satisﬁes
c1 = ±1/a1a2. The Ka1, a2 Torus knot is then a generic ﬁbre of M (n, 0, (a1, b1), (a2, b2)).

One can compare this with the formula for G = SU (2), [23, 29].

The perturbative holomorphic partition function with the inclusion of the ﬁgure eight
knot, shown in Figure 2, for an inﬁnite dimensional representation, was determined in
[14] but our methods, unfortunately, do not extend to give a non-perturbative evaluation
in this case.

9.3 Beyond Lens Spaces

We begin this section with an observation on the partition function in the large s limit
(8.7), namely that it can be written in factorized form since we can take the root of the

19

Ray-Singer Torsion. This suggests, that in this limit at least, the partition function for
general Seifert manifolds also factorises.

The large s limit makes no sense in (8.1) as s has been set to zero there. What real
theory does the factorization correspond to then? We need a theory that gives us as
its ‘holomorphic’ part the square root of the Ray-Singer Torsion evaluated at a ﬂat
connection. One possibility is an action which includes a Chern-Simons term and a BF
term to land on ﬂat connections but such a theory leads to the Ray-Singer Torsion and
not its square root. This situation can be remedied with the addition of

(cid:90)

Tr(cid:0)ψdAψ + ρdAρ(cid:1)

(9.9)

M

to the action where ψ and ψ are Grassmann odd Lie algebra valued 1-forms and ρ is a
Grassmann even Lie algebra valued 1-form. This term is, by itself, not gauge invariant
under gauge transformations for the new ﬁelds, e.g. under ρ → ρ + dAσ but can be
compensated for by transforming B (by shifting it by a multiple of [ρ, σ] in this case).

We should point out that the derivation of the path integral is also correct when the
3-manifold is S2 × S1 even though this is not a QHS. The components φ and λ are now
those along the S1 direction and one sets p = 0 in (7.1) and subsequent formulae. This
path integral is usually normalised to unity (as in the compact case one is counting
conformal blocks).
The restriction that the Seifert manifold be a QHS comes from the fact that we have
no control over Abelian B modes that are simultaneously constant on the ﬁbre and
harmonic on the base. These modes are not damped in the path integral and so lead to
a divergence. The corresponding A modes are compact and so do not give rise to any
diﬃculty.

G.T. would like to thank S. Gukov for suggesting that it might be of interest to apply
Abelianization to complex Chern Simons theory (at the Recent Advances in Topological
Quantum Field Theory meeting in Lisbon in 2012) and for many useful comments on a
preliminary version of this paper. The work of MB is partially supported through the
NCCR SwissMAP (The Mathematics of Physics) of the Swiss Science Foundation. The
knots in Figures 1 and 2 were drawn using the PSTricks knot macro pst-knot created
by Herbert Voß.
