Abstract

We present predictions for the inclusive production of bottom jets in proton-antiproton collisions

at 1.96 TeV and proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV. The bottom quark is considered massless. In

this scheme, we ﬁnd that at small transverse momentum (pT ) the ratio of the next-to-leading order

to the leading-order cross section (K factor) is smaller than one. It increases with increasing pT and

approaches one at larger pT at a value depending essentially on the choice of the renormalization

scale. Adding non-perturbative corrections obtained from PYTHIA Monte Carlo calculations leads

to reasonable agreement with experimental b-jet cross sections obtained by the CDF and the CMS

collaborations.

INTRODUCTION

The cross section for producing jets in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron

Collider (LHC) constitutes an important testing ground of perturbative Quantum Chromo-

dynamics (QCD) and oﬀers information for the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs).

So far, all predictions for LHC experiments, and also for Tevatron experiments, have been

found in very good agreement with the measurements. In these predictions, the contribu-

tions of heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are included. Since they are usually only a few

percent of the total jet production cross sections and considering the experimental error, it

is not clear, whether the heavy quark jets are satisfactorily described by perturbative QCD

(pQCD) calculations.

To test these heavy quark contributions, it is necessary to compare to cross sections for the

production of particular heavy quark jets. Such measurements have been done recently by

the CDF collaboration [1] at the Tevatron and the CMS [2] and ATLAS [3] collaborations

at the LHC. The CDF measurement of the inclusive b-jet production cross section in p¯p
collisions is performed for jets with rapidity y in the range |y| ≤ 0.7 and for transverse
momenta pT in the region 38 < pT < 400 GeV, for events, in which the decay vertex of the

b-hadron is directly reconstructed. For this, the cone-based-iterative MidPoint algorithm is
applied. This algorithm is used for jet reconstruction in the y − φ space, assuming a cone
radius of 0.7. Further details on b-jet identiﬁcation through secondary vertex reconstruction

can be found in Ref. [1].

As a ﬁrst step in a perturbative approach, one can, roughly speaking, describe the data

by a leading order (LO) calculation plus parton shower plus hadronization, where the latter

two are non-perturbative eﬀects.

In this sense, next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations

are part of the parton shower, which has to be treated accordingly, when higher-order

calculations are explicitly included and multiplicative factors for the correct treatment of

the non-perturbative eﬀects have to be identiﬁed.

The measured b-jet production cross section from CDF is compared to the leading-order

PYTHIA-TUNE A Monte Carlo [21] program predictions with the CTEQ5L PDF, ﬁnding

reasonably good agreement between data and PYTHIA predictions [1], and to NLO pQCD

predictions by Frixione and Mangano [4]. This theoretical NLO prediction is based on the

massive quark scheme or ﬁxed ﬂavor number scheme (FFNS), in which bottom quarks ap-

2

pear in the ﬁnal state only, but not as partons in the initial state. Here, the comparison is

done applying a b-quark pole mass mb = 4.75 GeV, the CTEQ6M PDF, renormalization and
factorization scales µR and µF set to µ0 = pp2

b/2, and with a cone-based algorithm

T + m2

using cone size R = 0.7 and Rsep = 1.3. Furthermore, it includes an additional correc-

tion factor for non-perturbative contributions, i.e., contributions from underlying event and

hadronization processes equal to 1.2 at low pT and equal to 1.0 for pT > 140 GeV. The data

and theoretical cross sections are found in approximate agreement, most of the data points

lie above the theoretical predictions by nearly 50%.

At the LHC, two collaborations, CMS [2] and ATLAS [3], have measured inclusive b-jet

cross sections at 7 TeV center-of-mass (c.m.) energy. In this work, we shall concentrate on

the comparison with the CMS data [2]. The jet transverse momentum in the cross sections

presented by CMS lies between 18 < pT < 200 GeV for several rapidity intervals in the range
0.0 < |y| < 2.2. To obtain the bottom jets, the anti-kT algorithm [5] with R=0.5 is used
experimentally, as well as in the theoretical NLO calculations [4]. In the CMS experiment,

b-jets are identiﬁed by ﬁnding the secondary decay vertex of the b-hadrons. The measured

cross sections have been compared to the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator [6], and to the

MC@NLO [7, 8] Monte Carlo generator which is essentially based on the FFNS NLO cross

sections [4] with the subsequent Monte Carlo HERWIG generator [9] which contains shower

and hadronic corrections. The MC@NLO predictions are below the data in the central
region (|y| < 1.0) for low pT by approximately a factor of 1.5 to 2.0. The predictions from
the PYTHIA generator agree with the data at high pT , but overestimate the cross section

in the pT region below 50 GeV.

It is clear that the PYTHIA and also the MC@NLO prediction depend on the amount

of hadron corrections contained in these two Monte Carlo generators and it is not known

which amount originates from the underlying leading-order or next-to-leading order hard

perturbative QCD cross sections, the parton shower and the hadronic corrections.

It is the purpose of this work to ﬁnd out the NLO perturbative QCD cross section

for inclusive b-jet production at the Tevatron and the LHC center-of-mass energies and

to supplement the NLO predictions with estimates of the hadronic corrections.

In our

calculation, the bottom quark is considered massless, like all other quarks u, d, s and c. So

the calculations are performed in the zero-mass variable-ﬂavor-number scheme (ZM-VFNS)

as in our work on charm jets [10]. Such a framework has also been considered previously

3

by Banﬁ et al.

[11, 12]. They started from the NLOJET [13, 14] program, which is an

alternative to calculate jet cross sections in hadron-hadron collisions, where one sums over

all ﬂavors of outgoing partons. This program was modiﬁed in such a way that only b quarks

(or c quarks) appear in the ﬁnal state. In addition, they changed the jet algorithm for b

quarks. Unfortunately, this new jet algorithm for heavy quarks has not been used in the

analysis of the experimental data yet. It is not clear whether this can be realized.

In Sec. 2, we shall describe the theoretical framework and outline the PDF input for the

initial state. Section 3 contains our results for the bottom-jet cross section. In this section,

we also show a comparison with the single-inclusive jet cross section measured by the CDF

collaboration at the Tevatron. Conclusions and summary are presented in Sec. 4.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND PDF INPUT

As in our publication on charm jets [10], we rely on previous work on dijet production in
the reaction γ + p → jet+ X [15, 16], in which cross sections for inclusive one-jet and two-jet
production up to NLO for both, the direct and the resolved contributions are calculated.

The resolved part of this cross section routine can be used for p¯p or pp collisions replacing the

photon PDF by the (anti)proton PDF. The routine [15, 16] contains quarks of all ﬂavours

up to and including the bottom quark, as well as the gluon. This routine has been modiﬁed

in such a way that at least one bottom quark appears in the ﬁnal state, in the same way as

we did for the charm quark for charm jets in [10].

The routine [15, 16] is written for massless quarks, i.e. also the bottom quark is considered

massless. This is justiﬁed as long as the transverse momentum pT of the produced jets is

large enough, i.e. for p2

T ≫ m2
b.

For our prediction of the inclusive b-jet cross section, we employ the MSTW2008NLO

[17] PDF (central value) of the Durham collaboration. The chosen asymptotic scale para-
meter Λ(5)

s (mZ) = 0.118. We choose the renormalization

= 0.262 GeV corresponds to α(5)

M S

scale µR = ξRpT and the factorization scale µF = ξF pT , where pT is the largest transverse

momentum of the two or three ﬁnal state jets. ξR and ξF are dimensionless scale factors,

which are varied around ξR = ξF = 1 in a manner to be speciﬁed later. The center-of-mass
energy of the proton-proton collisions is taken as √s = 7 TeV as for the data of CMS [2],
and as √s = 1.96 TeV for the p¯p collisions as for the data of CDF [1].

4

The experimental data of CDF have been read oﬀ from the publications in Ref. [1]. Since

the bin size in pT was not speciﬁed there, we did our calculation with a bin size of ∆pT = 10

GeV and plotted the CDF data for ﬁxed pT values. The bin size in pT for the CMS data is
taken from Ref. [18]. The CMS data [2] appear for ﬁve bin sizes in |y| between 0 < |y| < 2.2.
In our comparison with these data, we shall limit ourselves to the two most central bin
sizes: 0 < |y| < 0.5 and 0.5 < |y| < 1.0, where the discrepancy with the MC@NLO [7, 8]
predictions is the largest.

III. RESULTS

A. Comparison with CDF data

We start with the predictions for and the comparison to the inclusive b-jet production

data obtained by the CDF Collaboration at the Tevatron [1]. In order to check our program,
we have ﬁrst calculated the cross section dσ/dpT dy for p + ¯p → single jet + X in the pT
range 54 < pT < 700 GeV and with rapidity |y| < 0.1 in pT bins as chosen by CDF [19]
for their measurement. Correction factors that approximately account for non-perturbative

contributions from the underlying event and fragmentation of partons into hadrons as given

in Ref. [19] were multiplied to the theoretical results. These non-perturbative correction

factors are estimated using the PYTHIA-TUNE A Monte Carlo routine [20, 21]. The cor-

rection factors decrease with increasing pT and lie below 1.2. The jets in the CDF analysis,

as in our calculations, are deﬁned with the kT algorithm [22, 23] with the radius R=0.7.

Our results are shown in Fig. 1, and compared to the CDF data [19]. The agreement

is satisfactory. Deviations occur for small pT and for the largest pT bin. The scales are

µR = µF = pT /2 and the theoretical error in our calculations has been estimated by varying

µR = µF by a factor of 2 up and down as usual. As seen in Fig. 1, most of the data points

lie inside the theoretical error band. Our results can also be compared to the theoretical

curves in Ref. [19] which have been calculated with the JETRAD routine [24] and the PDF

set CTEQ6.1M [25] instead of the more modern PDF CT10 [26] used in our work. These

diﬀerent choices of PDFs may explain small diﬀerences in the NLO predictions in [19] as

compared to our calculation.

The results for the inclusive b-jet cross sections at √s = 1.96 TeV are shown in Fig. 2

in LO pQCD and as K factors, where K is the ratio of the NLO to the LO cross section

K = (dσ/dpT dy)N LO/(dσ/dpT dy)LO as a function of pT . The scales for the LO cross sections

are chosen as in [1], namely ξR = ξF = 0.5 (default, full line), ξR = ξF = 0.25 (upper broken

line) and ξR = ξF = 1.0 (lower broken line). In Fig. 2, we have also plotted the data for the

inclusive b-jet cross section as measured by CDF [1]. These data in numerical form have

been read from the publication in [1]. As we can see, the corresponding LO cross sections

are smaller than the experimental data by approximately a factor of 2 for low pT and 4 for

the largest pT bin. The LO cross sections are multiplied with the hadronization correction

factor 1.2 as reported in [1].

If as usual, i.e.

for jet cross sections of all ﬂavors, the NLO corrections would increase

the b-jet cross sections by factors 2 to 3, we would have approximate agreement with the

data. Unfortunately, this is not the case as we can see from Fig. 2 in the right frame. The

K factors are smaller than 1 for small pT and approach values of 1 for larger values of pT

depending on the choice of scales. For the scale choice ξR = 2.0, ξF = 1.0 (full line) this

occurs at pT = 250 GeV and for the larger scale ξR = 4.0, ξF = 2.0 at pT = 150 GeV (upper

broken line). For the usual scale choice ξR = ξF = 1.0 the K factor is smaller than 1 in

the whole considered pt range up to pT = 300 GeV (lower broken line). The reason for the

K factor to be smaller than 1 at small pT lies in the fact that at these pT values the jet

cross section for all ﬂavors as in Fig. 1 has large contributions from the hard scattering cross
sections for light quarks as for example gg → q ¯qg, where q stands for u, d, s, c quarks. Of
course, these contributions are missing in the b-jet cross section. At larger pT , these light

quark contributions are presumably less important.

These results can be compared to the b-jet cross sections obtained in the FFNS, which

can be found in Ref. [1] and which have been calculated with the NLO routine in Ref. [4].

These theoretical results show the expected scale dependence, i.e. smaller scales for µR = µF

lead to larger cross sections. The scale µR = µ0/2 is chosen as the default scale, µR = µ0/4

for the maximal and µR = µ0 for the minimal cross section. In our case with massless b

7

quarks, it is just the opposite, increasing the scale µR leads to larger b-jet cross sections,

since the NLO corrections are reduced with increasing µR. Second, the agreement between

theory and data in Ref. [1] is best for µR = µ0/4 in the range of pT > 80 GeV and for

µR = µ0/2 if pT < 80 GeV, whereas in our case for all considered scales the data lie above

the predicted cross sections.

Our NLO cross sections are shown in Fig. 3, now for the scale choices: ξR = 4.0, ξF = 2.0

(full line), ξR = 8.0, ξF = 4.0 (upper broken line) and ξR = 2.0, ξF = 1.0 (lower broken

line). The ﬁrst and the last of these scale choices agree with those made for the K factor

calculation in Fig. 2 (right frame). The choice of a larger renormalization scale, of course, has

the eﬀect that the NLO corrections to the cross section are reduced. At large pT , the b-jet

cross section for all three scales is almost the same as in the LO approximation (see Fig. 2,

left frame) as to be expected from the K factors in Fig. 2 (right frame). For these results,

the jet algorithm is the cone algorithm with R = 0.7 and Rsep = 1.3 which is considered

best to represent the cone choice in the experimental analysis [4]. As PDF we have chosen

the MSTW2008NLO version [17]. The NLO curves in Fig. 3 are compared to the data for

inclusive b-jet cross sections as measured by CDF [1]. The agreement is similar as for the

LO cross sections (see Fig. 2 left).

The cross-section calculations in the FFNS and in the ZM-VFNS behave quite diﬀerently,

which follows already from the diﬀerent scale dependence. The reason for this though is not

known yet and would require a more detailed investigation, which is beyond this work.

One possible reason might be that in our approach with massless bottom quarks, there are

additional NLO contributions to the b-jet cross section originating from the b-quark PDF of

the proton (antiproton) not present in the FFNS, since there it would amount to a NNLO

contribution.

The unusual behaviour of the theoretical NLO prediction in comparison with the CDF

data might be explained by missing non-perturbative hadronic and underlying event contri-

butions. The CDF data have been compared in Ref. [1] also with the PYTHIA-TUNE A

[21, 27] predictions and good agreement has been found up to pT = 200 GeV. The PYTHIA

Monte Carlo routines are based on LO hard production matrix elements and LO PDFs. Our

LO predictions have been done with the same PDF [17] as for our NLO predictions and the

results are shown in Fig. 2 left frame. The diﬀerent choice of PDFs should have only little

inﬂuence in this case. We saw in that ﬁgure that the LO cross section is nearer to the CDF

data and similar to the NLO cross section. According to Ref. [1], the PYTHIA prediction

and the CDF data agree more or less, so that the diﬀerence between PYTHIA and LO

predictions would give a correction factor which brings the LO prediction into agreement

and the NLO prediction, which is somewhat smaller at low pT than the LO prediction, much

closer to the data than the NLO curve plotted in Fig. 3. In other words, for NLO, the data

of CDF need a much larger non-perturbative correction factor than the factor 1.2 which we

applied in our plot of the NLO cross section in Fig. 3. The correction factor 1.2 originates

from the same PYTHIA calculation, but with the diﬀerence that the contributions from

multiple parton interactions and string fragmentation are subtracted from the PYTHIA re-

sult, because they are usually considered already to be part of the NLO corrections. This

means that a correction factor that contains besides the non-perturbative hadronization

corrections and contributions from the underlying event also the parton showers must be

applied to come closer to the experimental cross section. As is well known, this implies some

double counting since the parton showers contain some NLO corrections which are already

contained in the perturbative NLO contributions.

9

We shall see in the next subsection that the same pattern also follows from the comparison

with the b-jet production cross section as measured by CMS [2]. Since we do not have

the PYTHIA predictions at our disposal, we cannot be more quantitative concerning the

comparison of the CDF data with our NLO calculations. It seems, however, that a much

larger part of the b-jet cross section originates from the non-perturbative contribution and

not just from the perturbative NLO contribution as it is the case for the single-jet cross

section of all ﬂavors.

At this point, we want to mention that the non-perturbative corrections are applied to

the NLO b-jet cross section in form of a factor 1.2, taken from [1] and obtained from the

PYTHIA Monte Carlo routine which is based on LO b-jet cross section with massive b

and c quarks and only u-, d-, s- and g-PDFs of the proton and antiproton. From earlier

studies we know that the b-jet and c-jet production cross section in LO diﬀers only at rather
small pT ≃ mb, mc from the massless LO cross sections. How ﬁnite values of mb and mc
inﬂuence the parton shower contributions is not known. In addition, it is also not known

how much the non-perturbative corrections are changed, if one adds b- and c-quark PDFs

of the in-going hadrons in the LO cross section.

B. Comparison with CMS data

The CMS Collaboration has also measured the p + p → single jet + X cross section
for all ﬂavors in the range 18 < pT < 1684 GeV [28]. This has been compared to our

calculations using the same routine as in this work in Fig. 1 of Ref. [10], with the result

that good agreement between predictions and data has been found. In the following, we

show the comparison of our prediction to the cross section measurements for single bottom
production p + p → bottom jet + X published in Ref. [2]. We do this for two rapidity regions
|y| ≤ 0.5 and 0.5 ≤ |y| ≤ 1.0, and for the jet transverse momenta in the range between
18 < pT < 200 GeV.

In Ref. [2], the CMS data have been compared to PYTHIA predictions [6] with the result

that for pT > 50 GeV good agreement had been found, whereas for pT < 50 GeV the

PYTHIA prediction was much larger than the data. This also occurred for the other three

rapidity ranges not considered in this work. In addition, the CMS data have been compared
to the MC@NLO predictions. For the two lowest |y|-regions, the MC@NLO values are below

the data by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 almost over the whole range of pT values.

Next, we want to see how well our NLO predictions describe the CMS b-jet cross section

data. For this purpose, we need to know the non-perturbative corrections. As an estimate

for these corrections, we take the PYTHIA predictions made available to us in numerical

form as they were plotted in Ref. [2] by R. Kogler and M.A. Voutilainen from the CMS

Collaboration [29]. From the PYTHIA cross section, we subtracted the LO predictions

as we proposed already for the comparison with the CDF data. The PYTHIA minus LO
predictions are plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for both rapidity regions |y| ≤ 0.5 (dotted line in
the left frame of Fig. 4) and for 0.5 ≤ |y| ≤ 1.0 (dotted line in the left frame of Fig. 5). As can
be seen form these two ﬁgures, for pT ≤ 35 GeV the CMS experimental data almost agree
with these non-perturbative contributions. For pT > 35 GeV the data points deviate from

11

the dotted histogram and at the largest pT bin, the dotted histogram yields approximately
50% of the experimental cross section for both |y| regions.

In Fig. 4 (left frame) and Fig. 5 (left frame), we have also plotted our prediction for

the NLO cross section (full line histogram) together with the scale variation (dashed line

histograms). These NLO cross sections are obtained with the scale factors ξR = 4.0, ξF = 1.0

(default prediction), ξR = 8.0, ξF = 2.0 (upper broken line) and ξR = 2.0, ξF = 1.0 (lower

broken line). The value ξR = 4.0 for the default prediction has been chosen in order to

reduce the coupling constant to obtain a reasonably large NLO cross section for the smaller

pT , where the NLO cross section is still smaller than the LO prediction, giving rise to a K

factor smaller than one, as we observed already for the prediction of the CDF data. At very

small pT , our prediction in NLO is approximately a factor 10 smaller than the data points so

that the non-perturbative part alone produces the b-jet cross section. For the larger pT this

factor reduces to 3. This means that for all pT our NLO prediction is below the measured

cross section data. The scale dependencies of the NLO prediction decrease towards larger

pT and have, except for the ﬁrst ﬁve pT bins, no large eﬀect.

In Fig. 4 (right frame) and Fig. 5 (right frame), the NLO cross sections and the non-

perturbative contributions PYTHIA minus LO cross section have been added and compared

to the CMS data. We ﬁnd reasonable agreement between this prediction and the data inside
the experimental errors up to approximately pT ≃ 100 GeV. For larger pT , the diﬀerence
between prediction and data increases. But even at the largest pT bin, the diﬀerence between

the predicted and the measured cross section is not more than 20%, while the measured cross

section is throughout larger than the theoretical cross section.

As already mentioned in connection with the comparison to the CDF cross section data,

the PYTHIA predictions contain not only the hadronization corrections, but also additional

parton shower corrections, which on the other hand are also part of NLO corrections. Of

course, not all parton shower corrections would be equivalent to our NLO corrections, since

they contain additional higher order contributions not contained in our NLO corrections.

The numerical data given to us contain both contributions, hadronization corrections and

parton shower corrections, together.

Usually the parton shower corrections contribute at small pT and diminish for increasing

pT . Suppose they would be negligible at the highest pT bin, then the hadronic corrections

would still be larger than our NLO prediction in this bin (see Fig. 4 and 5, left frames). Since

we have no information on the details of the ”non-perturbative” PYTHIA corrections, we

cannot subtract the contribution originating from the parton shower corrections to obtain

the purely hadronic corrections, etc, which are usually added to the perturbative NLO cross

sections. We expect that after subtraction of the parton shower corrections, the agreement

between our results and the CMS data would deteriorate and we would obtain similar results

as for the MC@NLO result in Ref. [2], although these results have an appreciable error [2, 29]

due to varying the renormalization scale, from variation of the parameters of the CTEQ PDF

and from changing the b-quark mass.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the inclusive bottom-jet cross section at NLO of QCD in the ZM-VFN
scheme, i.e., with active bottom quarks in the proton and antiproton at √s = 1.96 TeV for p¯p
and √s = 7 TeV for pp collisions. Both heavy quarks are considered massless. Our results are
compared to experimental jet cross section measurements by the CDF collaboration at the

Tevatron and the CMS collaboration at the LHC. To our surprise, the NLO cross section for
both √s energies are much smaller than the measured cross sections. The NLO cross sections
are for most of the considered pT range even smaller than the LO cross sections, i.e. the K

13

factors are smaller than one. This means that the total NLO contribution, i.e., without the

LO contribution, is negative. There exist several possibilities to increase this contribution.

Examples are: contributions originating from intrinsic b-quark contribution to the hadron

PDF, as has been considered recently by Lyonnet et al. in Ref. [30], or contributions from

NNLO, which might become known in the future. Another possibility are non-perturbative

hadronic corrections which then must be much larger than have been estimated with the

PYTHIA Monte Carlo routine in Ref. [1]. This approach has been followed in this work. It

turns out that if the PYTHIA predictions minus the LO perturbative cross section is added

to our NLO predictions, reasonable agreement with the measured b-jet cross sections can

be achieved for the CDF data as well as for the CMS data. This approach has the problem

of double counting due to the parton shower contributions in the PYTHIA Monte Carlo

approach, a topic which we leave for investigations in the future.
