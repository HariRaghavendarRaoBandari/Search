Abstract: We demonstrate ﬁber Fabry-Perot (FFP) cavities with concave
mirrors that can be operated at cavity lengths as large as 1.5 mm without
signiﬁcant deterioration of the ﬁnesse. This is achieved by using a laser dot
machining technique to shape spherical mirrors with ultralow roughness
and employing single-mode ﬁbers with large mode area for good mode
matching to the cavity. Additionally, in contrast to previous FFPs, these
cavities can be used over an octave-spanning frequency range with adequate
coatings. We also show directly that shape deviations caused by the ﬁber’s
index proﬁle lead to a ﬁnesse decrease as observed in earlier attempts to
build long FFP cavities, and show a way to overcome this problem.

Introduction

1.
Fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP) microcavities with CO2 laser-machined concave mirrors [11, 22] are be-
ing used in a fast-growing number of applications, ranging from cavity quantum electrodynam-
ics with atomic, molecular and solid-state emitters [11, 33–77] and optomechanical systems [88] to
Raman spectrometers for atmospheric gases [99] and new scanning microscopy techniques [1010].
This range of applications could be further increased, and a gap in micro-optical technology
could be ﬁlled, by increasing the optical length L of these cavities to the millimeter range
while maintaining their crucial advantages such as built-in ﬁber coupling, small mode waist,
high ﬁnesse and high passive stability. Development towards this goal has been initiated by the
ion trap community [1111, 1212], where FFP cavities are now arguably the most promising candi-
date for realizing a high-ﬁdelity light-matter quantum interface. In this application, increased
cavity length will mitigate or even remove the perturbation of the trapping potential induced
by the dielectric mirrors. With neutral atoms, increased mirror distance will allow elongated
atomic ensembles to be placed in the cavity, as required for improving compact, trapped-atom
atomic clocks [1313] by cavity squeezing [1414, 1515]. Finally, because of the reduced free spectral
range, larger L will also make it possible to use laser-machined concave mirrors in telecom
applications of FFP cavities, where planar mirrors [1616] are currently being used in commercial
solutions [1717].

Two factors have limited L in earlier FFP implementations. First, the nonspherical proﬁle
generated by a single CO2 laser pulse causes additional losses which are negligible for short
cavities, but become important long before L reaches the stability limit [22,1111,1212,1818]. The Gaus-
sian rather than spherical shape [22] limits the effective mirror diameter, even when a very large

CO2 beam diameter is used [1919]. Shape deviations due to the doping of the ﬁber core [1212]
and to the restricted heat ﬂow in the ﬁber [2020] also contribute to this limitation. Second, be-
cause FFPs have no mode-matching optics, the mode ﬁeld diameter of the ﬁber determines the
coupling efﬁciency between the ﬁber and cavity mode. With typical mirror curvatures, the stan-
dard single-mode (SM) ﬁbers used in earlier FFP implementations provide near-perfect mode
matching to short cavities, and are used with great success in cavity quantum electrodynam-
ics experiments. Resonant cavity transmission Tc rapidly drops, however, when L is increased
beyond a few hundred µm [22, 1111].

Concerning the mirror proﬁle, a natural approach is to use multiple CO2 laser pulses on the
same ﬁber, instead of a single pulse. A ﬁrst application of this approach was demonstrated
recently in [1212], where the ﬁber was rotated about its axis between pulses. The main purpose
of this rotation was to reduce mirror ellipticity, but the technique also resulted in larger mirror
proﬁles, enabling values of L up to 400 µm before the ﬁnesse dropped by 50%, for cavities with
one SM ﬁber. However, the mirror proﬁle still remained Gaussian and the problem of reduced
transmission remained unsolved.

Here, we overcome both limitations. To address the mirror shape limitation, we apply a newly
developed CO2 dot milling technique, where a large number of weak individual pulses sequen-
tially address an optimized pattern of target points on the substrate surface. This method gives
access to a wide range of shapes with extremely precise control over the surface proﬁle, while
maintaining the excellent surface roughness that is characteristic of CO2 machining. Here we
show that it enables fabrication of large, spherical structures, as required for long cavities, with
a shape deviation of less than λ /20. To address the mode-matching issue, we use large-mode-
area photonic-crystal (PC) ﬁbers, also known as “endlessly single-mode” ﬁbers [2121]. We ﬁnd
that CO2 machining produces excellent results on these ﬁbers when the holes are collapsed
adequately. To measure the performance of the improved mirrors, we have built cavities and
performed ﬁnesse and transmission measurements. L > 1.6mm is reached before the ﬁnesse
drops by 50%. We present measurements of ﬁnesse as a function of L for different cavities
and compare them to simulations that use the measured mirror proﬁles, ﬁnding good agree-
ment. These simulations also clarify the impact of doping-related shape variations. We also
measure cavity transmisson over the full length range and directly compare the results of a
PC-multimode (MM) ﬁber cavity to a SM-MM cavity with similar mirror parameters. We ﬁnd
that the PC ﬁber improves the transmission by an order of magnitude for cavity lengths beyond
1 mm.

2. The role of the cavity mode radius on the ﬁber mirrors
The mode radius of the cavity mode on the mirrors plays an important role for both the losses
and the mode matching. Limiting ourselves to symmetric cavities for simplicity, the mode ra-
dius on the cavity mirrors is wm = wc
is the waist radius of the cavity mode and zR = πw2
c/λ its Rayleigh range, R is the radius of
curvature (ROC) of the mirrors, L the cavity length, and λ the wavelength. A small wm has
the advantage of minimizing the clipping losses due to the ﬁnite mirror diameter (see Sec. 55
below). Additionally, for the long cavities that we are targeting here, wm tends to be larger than
the mode ﬁeld radius of the input ﬁber, w f . This reduces the power coupling efﬁciency ε from
the ﬁber to the cavity, and consequently, the overall (ﬁber-to-ﬁber) resonant cavity transmission
Tc. Here as well, reducing wm is beneﬁcial. The smallest wm that can be reached for a given L
is realized for R = L, i.e., a confocal cavity. In that case,

Taking λ = 780nm and L = 1.2mm for example, we ﬁnd wm,min = 17.3 µm and wc = 12.2 µm.
This is still much larger than the mode ﬁeld radius of a typical SM ﬁber, so that a better solution
must be found, as discussed further below.

The ﬁber-to-cavity power coupling efﬁciency can be approximated by the mode overlap of

two Gaussian modes [2222],

w f being the waist radius of the mode entering the cavity from the ﬁber, wc that of the cavity
mode as before, and s the distance between the two waist positions. The lensing effect of the
concave mirror structure, as well as the additional phase mismatch due to the wavefront cur-
vature of the cavity mode can be neglected for the long FFPs considered here. (A treatment
including these effects can be found in the appendix of [22].) For a symmetric cavity, s = L/2.

Fig. 11 a) shows this coupling efﬁciency for different α. The optimum coupling εmax for a

to 1 ≤ w f /wc (cid:46) 1.2: for cavity lengths up to the confocal length, the optimum ﬁber mode ra-
dius is always close to the waist of the cavity mode. A coupling efﬁciency rigorously equal to
1 can only be reached for α = 0, but high coupling efﬁciencies ε > 0.8 are possible for a wide
range of α values, as shown in Fig. 11 b). Whether these efﬁciencies can actually be realized
experimentally depends on the availability of a suitable ﬁber. For long cavities, we have already
seen that wm tends to be larger than typical ﬁber modes, and can also cause losses due to ﬁ-
nite mirror diameter. Therefore, a good working point for these cavities is close to the confocal
conﬁguration α = 1, where wm is smallest. Note that further optimization is possible in situ-
ations where asymmetric cavities can be employed, notably for plano-concave conﬁgurations
with asymmetric reﬂectivity.

3. Photonic-Crystal Fibers for FFP Cavities
The discussion above shows that mode matching for long ﬁber cavities can be substantially
improved by using a ﬁber with larger mode ﬁeld diameter. It is known that large-core multimode
ﬁbers improve the transmission (see [1212] for a direct comparison). However, the need for a well-
deﬁned, stable coupling usually makes them a bad choice on the input side of the cavity11. A
promising alternative, which we explore here, is to use single-mode ﬁbers with large mode
area. Such ﬁbers are available based on different technologies. Here we use photonic-crystal
(PC) ﬁbers.

1In principle, this problem can be overcome by the use of time-reversal techniques to achieve the desired mode at

the output of the multimode ﬁber [2323]. However, a suitable scheme to obtain an error signal remains to be found.

Fig. 1. a) Power coupling between the incoupling ﬁber mode and the mode of a symmetric
cavity for different values of α (the cavity length normalized to the Rayleigh range of the
cavity mode). The red dashed lines indicate the increased power coupling expected from
the use of a PC ﬁber (w f = 8.2 µm) with respect to a standard SM ﬁber (w f = 3 µm)
for an example cavity with w0 = 14.1 µm and L = 1.2mm. The blue shaded area shows
the stability region of the symmetric cavity. b) Maximum achievable power coupling for a
given α.

Let us evaluate the power coupling that can be expected for L = 1.2mm, which is the targeted
cavity length in our application. In practice, at the confocal point itself, stability is compromised
by the fact that the mirror ROCs have some tolerance from sample to sample (see sec. 4.44.4
below), so we choose to work at α ∼ 0.75. The required ROC to realize a given combination

(α,L) is R = L/2(cid:0)1/α2 + 1(cid:1). For L = 1.2mm and α = 0.75, the required ROC is R = 1.67mm.

The calculated cavity mode waist for these parameters is wc = 14.1 µm at 780 nm. The red
dashed lines in Fig. 11 show the expected power coupling efﬁciency of this mode to a standard
SM ﬁber with w f = 3µm, ε ≈ 11%, and to the NKT LMA20 photonic crystal ﬁber which
we have used in our experiments, which has a speciﬁed near-ﬁeld mode ﬁeld radius of w f =
(8.2 ± 0.8)µm at 780 nm (see Tab. 11 below for more information). This w f value leads to
ε ≈ 58%, nearly a factor 6 higher than with the SM ﬁber. Note however that this idealized
calculation neglects effects such as the non-Gaussian shape of the PC ﬁber mode, so its result
should be considered as an upper limit.

In addition to the improved mode coupling, these PC ﬁbers are “endlessly single mode”,
allowing stable single-mode guiding over a large wavelength range which can span more than
an octave. Here, we will use them with a dual-wavelength coating optimized for 780 nm and
1560 nm.

4. Machining large spherical structures by CO2 dot milling
4.1. Limiting factors in single-pulse machining
The proﬁle of the depression generated by a single CO2 laser pulse is Gaussian rather than
spherical [22], so that the effective mirror diameter is signiﬁcantly smaller than the diameter of
the depression. Additionally, due to boundary effects in heat transport during the laser machin-
ing, it is difﬁcult to machine depressions that extend over the full ﬁber surface [2020], even with a
very large CO2 beam diameter [1919]. The small effective mirror size causes clipping loss when
the transverse mode size on the mirror becomes comparable to the effective mirror diameter.
This typically happens long before L reaches to the stability limit [22, 1111, 1212, 1818]. Finally, it is
known that the milling proﬁle of a given laser pulse is affected by the doping proﬁle of the
ﬁber [1212]. The effect is most pronounced for SM ﬁbers, where it leads to a circular ridge at the

core-cladding interface. All three problems can be addressed by replacing the single CO2 pulse
by a series of pulses with different target positions.

4.2. Dot milling setup
Our machining setup, which will be described in more detail elsewhere [2424], is designed to en-
able surface machining with multiple, precisely positioned CO2 pulses (“shots”) and analysis
of the results on the ﬂy. It has three main components: the CO2 laser with external pulsing and
focusing optics, a high-precision, three-axis translation stage, and an in-situ optical proﬁlome-
ter (Fig. 22). The complete setup is enclosed in a temperature-stabilized laminar ﬂow box. A
motorized tilt stage (pitch and yaw) was mounted on the translation stages to align the ﬁber
cleave surface perpendicular to the CO2 beam axis before machining. The CO2 part is similar
to our earlier setups [22,2020]. However, the CO2 and proﬁlometry beam paths are kept separated,
with the translation stages ensuring reproducible travel between the two locations. The stages
have optical encoders for repeatble absolute positioning. The step size of the transverse stages
is 50nm. The optical proﬁlometer is based on a Mirau objective with a nominal transverse
resolution of 0.8 µm. To achieve best height (z) resolution, we use phase-shifting proﬁlome-
try [2525]. The measured noise for a reference surface is 1.4nm rms for a single proﬁle, which
can be further reduced to the sub-nm level by averaging several proﬁles. To localize the ﬁber
core of SM ﬁbers, weak light is coupled into the ﬁber, so that the core appears as a bright spot
on the microscope image. The whole system is software-controlled and allows for automated
centering.

With this improved setup, the measured average centering error of a CO2 shot with respect
to the ﬁber core is 0.9 µm, which is a signiﬁcant improvement over the earlier setup, and just
sufﬁcient to achieve reproducible mode-matching between the ﬁber and cavity modes. The
relative positions of the multiple shots making up the dot milling pattern have much better
accuracy, as they do not require large displacements.

4.3. Fiber preparation
We have machined three different ﬁber types, presented in Table 11. For good reproducibility of
the machining results, it is important to control the cleave angle to tight tolerances. We have
used a pneumatic cleaver with a speciﬁed typical cleave angle of less than 0.3 degrees [2626].

λ/420 W CO2LASERPowermeterShutterPolarizer80:20Mirau objective515 nmLED50:50MirrorCamera3-axes precisiontranslation stages Fiberpitch/yawmount780 nm LEDFLOur measured mean cleave angle deviation was less than 0.4 degrees throughout, and below
0.2 degrees for the SM ﬁbers. To achieve these results, the cleaver has to be calibrated carefully
and the copper-coated ﬁbers have to be straightend by hand before cleaving. For the PC ﬁber,
simple cleaving exposes the holes of the photonic crystal. We found that direct machining on
that structure was possible for proﬁles with R (cid:46) 300 µm. For the much shallower proﬁles of our
targeted R > 1000 µm mirrors, this simple approach turned out to be problematic. Therefore,
we have collapsed the holes before cleaving using the arc of a fusion splicer as described in
Ref. [2727]. The cleave was positioned at a distance dc ∼ 50 − 100 µm from the onset of the
collapsed region as shown in Fig. 33. Excellent results were achieved with the ﬁbers prepared
in that way. For shorter dc, residues of the six-fold symmetry of the PC hole pattern remained
visible in the machined structure.

4.4. Optimizing the dot milling process
Our fabrication goal was to obtain spherical mirror proﬁles with ROCs in the 1mm range,
and with a useful diameter of 100 µm. We have achieved good results using identical CO2
beam parameters for all dots in the pattern. For the results shown below, the beam had a 1/e2
radius w = 140 µm, and its power was P = 2.3W. The pulse length τ was adjusted such that an
individual milling pulse near the center of a ﬂat (cleaved) MM ﬁber yielded a depression with
depth t ∼ 100nm and diameter (2σ of a Gaussian ﬁt) of ∼ 30 µm. This led to 17ms ≤ τ ≤ 25ms
depending on the ﬁber type. This dot size is small enough to produce features with the required
resolution and using about one hundred pulses, while a smaller beam diameter would require
more pulses with no obvious advantage.

a)b)c)The milling process is highly nonlinear, so that the time order of the pulses also affects the
result. Furthermore, due to the ﬁnite size of the ﬁber, the effect of a given pulse also depends
on its distance from the center of the ﬁber surface. Therefore, ﬁnding a suitable milling pulse
pattern requires some empirical testing to reduce the parameter space before a systematic opti-
mization can be done. A typical pulse pattern is shown in ﬁg. 44 a); our optimization strategy will
be discussed in more detail in [2424]. Once the pattern is optimized, processing and characterizing
a single ﬁber with a typical 75-dot pattern takes less than 2 minutes.

1500 µm, where the mean deviation from a 2D spherical ﬁt is smaller than 12 nm, and the
maximum deviation smaller than 40 nm, over a circular region of interest with a diameter of
100 µm. Between samples processed with identical parameters, the measured R varies by about
±10% on SM and MM ﬁbers, and by about ±20% on PC ﬁbers. Within some limits, larger
and smaller proﬁles can be machined by simply changing the pulse length and scaling the
shot positions, without optimizing anew. When machining smaller R with the proﬁle of Fig. 44,
the mean deviation increases up to 59 nm for R = 330 µm. When producing R > 1500 µm the
mean deviation does not increase signiﬁcantly, but cleave imperfections start to compromise
the symmetry of the structure.

With SM ﬁbers, we also observe a shape deviation of 20-40nm height located near the inter-
face between the cladding and doped core, similar to that reported in [1212] for several pulses on
the ﬁber center. It can be compensated to some extent by slight adjustments in the milling pat-
tern, with the results shown in Fig. 66. Collapsed PC ﬁbers do not experience this effect, which
makes them particularly suitable for CO2 processing. Likewise, large-core MM ﬁbers are also
easy to process because of their large, homogeneous central region.

Fig. 6. Inﬂuence of the doped core region. Shown are the residuals of a 2D spherical ﬁt for
machined SM and PC ﬁber surfaces. The milling patterns are very similar for both ﬁbers
and are close to the one shown in Fig. 44(a). 73 pulses were used for the SM ﬁber and 70
for the PC ﬁber; the pulse length is τ = 17.6ms for the SM ﬁber and τ = 20ms for the
PC ﬁber. The data is the average of 120 proﬁle measurements for each ﬁber (see Sec. 5.35.3).
The radius of the ﬁt region was chosen to be 18 µm because this is the mode radius on the
ﬁber for a cavity of length L = 1200 µm and a ROC R = 1650 µm. The ﬁt for the PC ﬁber
gives R = 1492µm and the residual shows only a slow modulation, which could probably
be further reduced by ﬁne-tuning the pulse length of the last, central pulse. By contrast, the
residual of the standard SM ﬁber (ﬁtted R = 1508µm) shows a strong variation at the ﬁber
center at the interface between core an cladding material.

5. Long Fiber-Fabry Perot Cavities
We have machined a large number of SM, MM and PC ﬁbers and had them coated with an ion-
beam sputtered (IBS), dual-wavelength high-reﬂectivity coating [2828] for 780 nm and 1560 nm.
(This particular coating was chosen as required for our application, where Rb atoms are trapped
in a far off-resonant dipole trap inside the cavity.) Its nominal transmission is T = 30ppm at

15105051015x [µm]54321012Residual [nm]PCFSMF780 nm and 1560 nm; the sum T + L is 66± 2ppm at 780 nm and 34± 2ppm at 1560 nm, as
determined from ﬁnesse measurements on short FFP cavities.

5.1. Finesse and transmission measurement
We have built high-ﬁnesse cavities from ﬁber pairs of different ﬁber types using a three-axis
translation stage equipped with piezo actuators (Thorlabs MAX311D/M) and a two-axis rota-
tion stage (Thorlabs PR01/M, GNL10/M). Several PC-MM cavities were tested at both wave-
lengths. Compared to cavities with the standard Gaussian-shaped ﬁber mirrors, the difference
was striking. With mirror ROCs on the order of 1 mm, we could readily achieve stable cavities
with sizeable transmission for lengths L > 1mm – a length never achieved with the Gaussian-
shaped mirrors (Fig. 77(a)).

The cavities performed well at both wavelengths, and the measured ﬁnesse values were con-
sistent with the coating speciﬁcations. With traditional SM ﬁbers, it would be impossible to
use the same FFP cavity with wavelengths so far apart. The optical measurements presented
below were performed using an external-cavity diode laser at 780nm. The cavity length L was
measured with a simple video microscope. The free spectral range (FSR) was calculated from L
as νFSR = c/2L . The cavity length was then scanned around this position using the piezo. The
linewidth δν of the TEM00 mode was measured using an electro-optic modulator to generate
sidebands for frequency calibration.

These measurements were repeated for different cavity lengths over the full stability range.
Cavity transmission on resonance was also measured for every length. In order to eliminate
the uncertainty associated with coupling a free-space beam into the cavity ﬁber, we have ﬁrst
injected the free-space beam into an open-ended ﬁber and measured the power emerging from
the open end before splicing it to the mirror ﬁber. In this way, the uncertainty is only given by
the splice. Based on previous splices, we estimate splice transmission to be Tsplice (cid:38) 0.97 for
SM ﬁbers, and Tsplice (cid:38) 0.9 for PC ﬁbers. (The typical value for the PC case is closer to 0.95,
but is very sensitive to all splice preparations, such as the cleave angle.)

Fig. 77(b) and (c) show the ﬁnesse F = νFSR/δν and resonant transmission Tc measured at
780 nm as a function of cavity length for two different cavities: one with an SM ﬁber (ROC
measured by optical proﬁlometry: R1 = 1508± 65 µm) on the incoupling side and a MM ﬁber
(R2 = 1629± 73 µm) for outcoupling; the other with the same MM ﬁber, but a PC ﬁber (R1 =
1492± 110 µm) on the incoupling side. Because the ROCs are not exactly equal, an unstable
region exists for both cavities where R1 < L < R2. This is clearly visible in the ﬁnesse and
transmission data. Comparing the performance of the two cavities, the PC-MM conﬁguration
is superior in every respect. It shows higher transmission, especially for large L. This was
expected and validates the choice of the PC ﬁber, although the experimental values do not reach
the theoretical optimum yet (see Sec. 5.45.4 below). Furthermore, with this cavity, F is almost
constant up to L ∼ 1.5mm, whereas with the SM-MM cavity, it decreases signiﬁcantly with L,
even for short lengths. Such a decrease has been observed for all FFP cavities involving SM
ﬁbers [1111,1212,1818]; the authors of [1212] have conjectured that it is likely to be caused by the ridge
in the mirror proﬁle (cf. Fig. 66). We conﬁrm this quantitatively using a numerical simulation
that takes into account the measured mirror proﬁle, as described below in Sec. 5.35.3. This adverse
effect is virtually absent with PC ﬁbers, giving them an additional advantage in FFP cavities.

5.2. Analytical model: Clipping loss
Clipping loss for Gaussian cavity modes can be described with a simple analytical model [22].
The ﬁnesse of a high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot cavity as a function of the mirror properties is

cavity length measurement. The collapsed region of the PC ﬁber is visible. (b) Experimental
results (ﬁlled symbols) and simulations (empty symbols with dotted lines, see 5.35.3) for the
ﬁnesse as a function of length. Results are shown for an SM-MM cavity (red triangles)

with R1 = 1492± 110 µm and R2 as before. (The MM ﬁber is the same in both cavities.)
The blue solid line shows the result of the analytical clipping loss formula (66) ﬁtted to the
PC-MM data. The ﬁt parameters are given in Table 22. (c) Transmission of the cavities. The
PC ﬁber improves transmission by more than an order of magnitude for L > 1mm. The
lines show the calculated transmission using eq. 77 and the mode ﬁeld radius w f given in
the legend. w f = 6.1 µm is the mode ﬁeld radius measured independently for the PC ﬁber
(see Sec. 5.45.4). The blue dashed line for w f = 4.5 µm ﬁts the PC data well, but the large
deviation from the nominal value of the PC mode ﬁeld radius remains unexplained. The
sharp drop in ﬁnesse and transmission around L = 1650 µm corresponds to the unstable
region R1 < L < R2 of the slightly asymmetric cavity.

sions, LC the clipping losses, and each term is the sum of the contributions of the two mirrors.
Since all our ﬁber mirrors were coated in the same run, and all substrates are CO2-machined
fused silica, we assume that all loss terms are the same for the two mirrors except for clipping
loss. The latter depends on the effective mirror diameter Di (i = 1,2) and the mode ﬁeld radius
wi on the mirror: LC = Lcl (w1,D1) + Lcl (w2,D2), where [22]

Lcl (wi,Di) = exp(cid:0)−2(Di/2)2/w2

wi is determined by the cavity geometry, i.e., by the two ROCs Ri and L. In Fig. 77(b), the
ﬁnesse including the loss model of equation 66 was ﬁtted to the data of the PC-MM cavity (solid
blue line), leaving R1,2 and D1,2 as free parameters. The total losses LA + LS + T = 66ppm
were measured independently by short-cavity ﬁnesse measurements (see eq. 55) and are used as
ﬁxed parameters. In a perfectly symmetric cavity, it would be difﬁcult to attribute clipping loss
values to the individual mirrors, since an overestimation of one value could be compensated
by the other. Here, due to the slight difference of the ROCs, the beam radius is diverging on
the PC ﬁber mirror for L < 1650 µm and on the MM mirror for L > 1650 µm, and individual
Lcl values are obtained with good conﬁdence. (To test the reliability of the ﬁt, we have tried
to ﬁx D2 to a value 5% larger than the best ﬁt, and reﬁt the data with this restriction. This
lead to an increase of χ2 by 46%.) The result (solid blue curve in Fig. 77(b)) ﬁts the data well,
explaining the sharp drop of F for L ∼ 1.5mm and the decrease for L (cid:38) 1.8mm: in these
regions, the mode radii on the mirrors w1,2 diverge, explaining the decreasing ﬁnesse by a rise
of the clipping losses. The ROC values R1,2 and the effective mirror diameters Di resulting from
the ﬁt are shown in Table 22 together with the ROCs obtained from the 3D optical proﬁlometry
of the mirrors. All values agree within the error margins, which shows the reliability of our

3D reconstruction, and conﬁrms that the mirrors are well described by spheres. The initial goal
of creating mirror structures with Dm ≈ 100 µm is reached for both ﬁber types. Note that this
diameter was chosen to meet our requirements. It was not investigated which maximal diameter
the multi-shot method can create.

For the SM-MM cavity, F drops linearly with increasing L (red dots in Fig. 77(b)). The simple
clipping loss model of eq. 66 does not ﬁt this data with any reasonable parameters. This indicates
that the loss is not related to clipping on the mirror edges, but has its origin in irregularities of
the machined structures shown in Fig. 66. This is conﬁrmed by the numerical simulations which
we will now describe.

5.3. Full simulation of the cavity mode using reconstructed mirror surfaces
To gain further insight into the role of structure imperfections, and to be able to predict the
performance of the machined structures without building a cavity or even applying a coating,
we have performed numerical simulations of the cavity eigenmodes using the measured surface
proﬁles. We have used the FFT toolbox OSCAR [2929]. This toolbox simulates cavity eigenmodes
for arbitrary mirror proﬁles, which are represented as 2D arrays of height information. Each of

the proﬁles used in our simulation is the average of 120 proﬁles of the same ﬁber taken in
succession to reduce noise. Apart from this averaging, no ﬁt or ﬁlter was used to process the
proﬁle data. The proﬁles here were taken after coating, but no signiﬁcant deformation with
respect to the proﬁles of the uncoated structures could be seen.

The alignment procedure for the simulation is analogous to that of a real cavity: the two
proﬁles are spaced by a ﬁxed distance L, and the resonance closest to the target cavity length is
found. By tilting and translating one of the proﬁles, the transmission signal is optimized. In our
simulations, we have not attempted to rotate the proﬁles around the cavity axis. Their relative
angle is left at an arbitrary value and is not changed in the optimization. This is justiﬁed when
the deviation from rotational symmetry is small, as is the case here. The simulations are carried
out with higher mirror transmission (Tsim = 0.01) compared to the experiment to reduce the
computation time. This has no effect on the simulated clipping and scattering losses of the mir-
rors. The losses and transmission of the coating, which are not contained in the simulation, are
experimentally determined by short-cavity ﬁnesse measurements and added to the simulated
diffraction losses to determine the ﬁnesse using Eq. 55. The results of the simulated ﬁnesse are
shown in Fig. 77(b) as empty symbols connected by dotted lines for both cavities. Simulation
and experiment are in excellent agreement, which conﬁrms that the linear decay of the ﬁnesse
for the standard single-mode ﬁber is explained by the structure itself. Additional loss effects
from coating variations (as discussed in [1111, 3030]) are not signiﬁcant here. Furthermore, this re-
markable agreement means that such simulations could be used to optimize structures produced
by laser dot milling without laborious iterations of coating and cavity construction.

5.4. Cavity transmission
To compare the measured cavity transmissions to theoretical expectations,we have used the
simple model described in [22]. The power coupling efﬁciency ε between the input ﬁber and the
cavity mode (eq. 22) limits the resonant transmission Tc of a symmetric FFP cavity as

Tc = ε

T 2

(T + L )2 ,

(7)

where L = LS + LA + LC is the sum of all mirror losses. (We are assuming that the coupling
to the MM output ﬁber is perfect, which is reasonable because of the large mode area and high
acceptance angle of the MM ﬁber.) The lines in Fig. 77(c) are calculated using this equation.
The T values are the same for all three curves and are those of the multilayer coating (see
Sec. 5.25.2). The length-dependent L values are deduced from the ﬁnesse measurements and
take the additional loss with increasing L into account. The coating properties determine the
maximum Tc = 0.207, achieved for short cavity length. The red dashed line uses the nominal
mode ﬁeld radius w f = 3 µm of the SM ﬁber and ﬁts the SM-MM data well for lengths up to
L ≈ 770 µm. The sharp drop at this length is not expected from Gaussian mode overlap and
could be due to imperfections of the mirror proﬁle discussed above. In that case, optimization
of this proﬁle would bring Tc into agreement with the prediction also for larger L. However,
this would still be more than ﬁve times smaller than the measured Tc of the PC-MM cavity.
This conﬁrms the advantage of the PC ﬁber. Nevertheless, headroom for further improvement
remains: indeed, the PC-MM result falls below the expected value if we assume the catalog
value for the mode ﬁeld radius of the PC ﬁber (w f = 8.2 µm). A good ﬁt is obtained for a
much smaller w f = 4.5µm (blue dashed line in Fig. 77). To investigate the disagreement more
closely, we have measured the mode ﬁeld radius of the PC ﬁber independently. The beam proﬁle
was imaged with a camera at several distances (1.5 mm - 2.5 mm) from the ﬁber output, to
determine the divergence θ of the beam. By using w f = λ /(πθ ), we found w f = (6.1±0.2)µm,
signiﬁcantly smaller than the catalog value. The calculated transmission for this w f is shown in

Fig. 77 (green dash-dotted line), it remains above the measured values. The fact that the PC ﬁber
mode is not strictly Gaussian may explain some of the deviation. To investigate other possible
sources, we have tentatively added tilt and displacement in the calculation of ε following [2222],
but no parameter set could be found which ﬁts the experimental data as well as the model
without displacement or angle and w f = 4.5µm. Simple propagation of the outcoupled beam in
the collapsed part (assumed homogenous) changes the coupling to the cavity mode only slightly
and does not explain the difference between theory and experiment. Further possible effects of
wavefront distortions, diffraction or lensing at the position of the melted holes of the PC ﬁber
remain to be investigated. Understanding these effects may lead to further improvements of
coupling and transmission.

6. Conclusion
These results show that CO2 laser dot milling and large mode area photonic-crystal ﬁbers form a
powerful combination. The maximum length is extended into the millimeter range while main-
taining the advantages of a miniature, robust, ﬁber-based approach and an acceptable overall
transmission. Our results also indicate that an improved hole-collapsing process is likely to fur-
ther improve the transmission. The ﬁnesse F ∼ 50000 reached in our data is limited by the
dual-wavelength coating. The surface roughness of the CO2 process admits still higher values,
and it will be interesting to see whether these can also be reached at the length scale introduced
here. For a state-of-the-art single-wavelength coating, total absorption and scattering losses
LA + LS = 2×13.5ppm have been measured for a pair of ﬁber mirrors [1919]. Choosing a trans-
mission of the same value, and adding the clipping losses of 5.5 ppm per mirror estimated by
the simulations shown above for a cavity of L = 1mm, it should be possible to produce FFP
cavities of L = 1mm and a ﬁnesse of up to 97,000 with the method presented here. Beyond the
cavity QED applications for which we have originally developed it, we note that the free spec-
tral range for a 1.5 mm ﬁber cavity is is 100 GHz, approaching an interesting range for ﬁltering
applications.
