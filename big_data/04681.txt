THE DERIVED CATEGORY OF COMPLEX PERIODIC K-THEORY

LOCALIZED AT AN ODD PRIME

IRAKLI PATCHKORIA

Abstract. We prove that for an odd prime p, the derived category D(KU(p)) of the p-local
complex periodic K-theory spectrum KU(p) is triangulated equivalent to the derived category
of its homotopy ring π∗KU(p). This implies that if p is an odd prime, the triangulated category
D(KU(p)) is algebraic.

1. Introduction

The category of modules Mod-KU over the complex periodic K-theory spectrum KU has been
studied for at least thirty years. Using the fact that the homotopy ring π∗KU is isomorphic to
the Laurent polynomial ring Z[u, u−1], |u| = 2, and the universal coeﬃcient theorem, one can give
a complete algebraic description of the homotopy category Ho(Mod-KU ) = D(KU ), also known
as the derived category of KU . This description essentially goes back to Bousﬁeld [3, 4]. Wolbert
in [40] elaborated Bousﬁeld’s ideas in terms of modern notions of ring and module spectra. The
basic idea is that the isomorphism type of any object X ∈ D(KU ) is completely determined by
the isomorphism type of the homotopy π∗X, considered as a graded π∗KU -module. Furthermore,
using the universal coeﬃcient theorem, morphisms in D(KU ) admit an algebraic characterization
in terms of matrices consisting of elements of Hom and Ext groups over π∗KU . Parallel to this,
one can also consider the category of diﬀerential graded modules over π∗KU ∼= Z[u, u−1]. The
homotopy category of the latter, called the derived category of π∗KU and denoted by D(π∗KU ),
has very similar formal properties to those of D(KU ). The isomorphism class of an arbitrary
object M ∈ D(π∗KU ) is determined by the isomorphism type of the homology H∗M , considered
as a graded π∗KU -module. Moreover, the morphisms in D(π∗KU ) can also be described in terms
of matrices consisting of elements of certain Hom and Ext groups over π∗KU .

This analogy between D(KU ) and D(π∗KU ) turns out to be a shadow of a much stronger

statement. It follows from [16, 4.3.2] and [40] that there is an equivalence of categories

D(KU ) ∼ D(π∗KU ).

In fact, the results of [40] and [16] yield many other equivalences of similar type. Let R be an A∞-
ring spectrum. Suppose that the graded global homological dimension of the homotopy ring π∗R
is at most one and assume that π∗R is concentrated in even degrees. Then there is an equivalence
of categories

D(R) ∼ D(π∗R),

where D(R) is the derived category of R (the homotopy category of module spectra over R) and
D(π∗R) is the derived category of π∗R (the homotopy category of diﬀerential graded modules
over π∗R). Examples of such A∞-ring spectra include periodic complex topological K-theory
KU , periodic Adams summands E(1) (also known as the Johnson-Wilson spectra of height one),
connective Morava K-theories k(n) and p-local real periodic topological K-theory KO(p) for an
odd prime p. We note that if the inﬁnite loop space Ω∞R is not a product of Eilenberg-Mac
Lane spaces, then the model category Mod-R is not Quillen equivalent to the model category of
diﬀerential graded modules over π∗R. Hence the equivalence D(R) ∼ D(π∗R) does not come from
a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences if R = KU, E(1), k(n), or KO(p).

The derived category of complex periodic K-theory localized at an odd prime

The category D(R) has the important extra structure of a triangulated category. The triangu-

lated structure comes from the mapping cone sequences (distinguished triangles)

X

f

/ Y

/ Cone(f )

/ ΣX

and in particular encodes how the objects of D(R) are built out of R using suspensions, desuspen-
sions and cell attachments. Similarly, the derived category D(π∗R) together with the algebraic
mapping cone sequences is a triangulated category (see Subsection 2.2 for the details).

The question arises whether the equivalence D(R) ∼ D(π∗R) preserves the triangulated struc-
tures. More speciﬁcally, we are interested whether the equivalence D(KU ) ∼ D(π∗KU ) is com-
patible with the distinguished triangles. In order to be able to formulate these questions more
precisely, we recall some terminology:

Deﬁnition. Let T1 and T2 be triangulated categories. A triangulated equivalence between T1 and
T2 is an equivalence of categories

F : T1

∼

/ T2

together with a natural isomorphism (called the suspension isomorphism)

α : F ◦ Σ ∼= Σ ◦ F

such that for any distinguished triangle

X

f

/ Y

g

/ Z h

/ ΣX

in T1, the triangle

F (X)

F (f )

/ F (Y )

F (g)

/ F (Z)

αX ◦F (h)

/ ΣF (X)

is distinguished in T2. Here αX ◦ F (h) is the composite

F (Z)

F (h)

/ F (ΣX)

αX

/ ΣF (X).

If there exists a triangulated equivalence between T1 and T2, then we say that T1 and T2 are

triangulated equivalent.

Now we can pose the above advertised question precisely:

Question. Is the equivalence D(KU ) ∼ D(π∗KU ) triangulated?

One could also ask a weaker question: Does there exist a triangulated equivalence between
D(KU ) and D(π∗KU )? The answer to any of these questions is not known. Similar questions can
also be formulated when R = E(1), k(n) or KO(p).

The purpose of this work is to provide partial solutions to these problems. The following is

Theorem 5.2.4 in the paper and is proved at the very end:

Theorem 1. Let p be an odd prime. Then the derived categories D(KU(p)) and D(π∗KU(p)) are
triangulated equivalent.

Moreover, as a consequence of the general Theorem 4.2.3 in Section 4, we also obtain:

Theorem 2. Let R be any of the following A∞-ring spectra:

• Periodic Adams summand E(1) at an odd prime p;
• The connective Morava K-theory spectrum k(n), such that p is odd or n 6= 1;
• The p-local real periodic K-theory spectrum KO(p) for an odd prime p.

Then the derived categories D(R) and D(π∗R) are triangulated equivalent.

The equivalences constructed here are isomorphic to the ones constructed in [16, 4.3.2]. The
only slight diﬀerence is that the suspension isomorphisms might deviate from each other up to a
unit in π0R.

These theorems in particular show that the derived categories D(KU(p)), D(E(1)), D(k(n)) and
D(KO(p)) are algebraic in the sense of [34]. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 also provide new examples

of exotic triangulated equivalences, i.e., triangulated equivalences which do not come from Quillen
equivalences. A well-known example of such an equivalence is the triangulated equivalence between
D(K(n)) and D(π∗K(n)), where K(n) is periodic Morava K-theory. The proof of the latter uses
that π∗K(n) ∼= Fp[vn, v−1
n ] is a graded ﬁeld and hence the graded global homological dimension
of π∗K(n) is zero. Another important example is the triangulated equivalence of stable module
categories of Z/p2 and Fp[ε]/(ε2). These triangulated categories are both equivalent to Fp-vector
spaces.
It follows from the result of Schlichting [32] (see also [26]) that the associated model
categories are not Quillen equivalent. Further examples can be potentially constructed using the
preprint [13] of Franke (see also [31]). Franke deals with the case of the E(n)-local stable homotopy
category for higher chromatic primes. However, one of the key steps in the proof contains a gap
(partially ﬁlled in [27]) and this still needs to be ﬁxed. If we take this into account, to the author’s
knowledge Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 provide the ﬁrst examples of exotic triangulated equivalences
where the underlying homological algebra is not zero-dimensional (i.e., semi-simple).

We would also like to remind the reader that in contrast to Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, there
are examples of model categories which have the rigidity property that their homotopy categories
admit a unique model up to Quillen equivalence. Examples include the model categories of spec-
tra [33], K(2)-local spectra [30], and modules over Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectra (see [36]).
Moreover, the paper [34] shows that the homotopy category of spectra, also known as the stable
homotopy category, is not algebraic.

Finally, before describing the methods of the proofs, we brieﬂy mention connections of Theorem
1 with C∗-algebras. It follows from [5] and [9] that the thick subcategory B generated by the
C∗-algebra C inside the KK-category (also known as the bootstrap class) embeds into D(KU )
fully-faithfully. The papers [2] and [23] pose the question of whether the triangulated category B
is algebraic. Theorem 1 implies that if we p-localize the category B at an odd prime p, then the
resulting triangulated category B(p) is algebraic.

Methods of the proofs. The proof of Theorem 2 is based on the ideas of Franke [13] and
the results of the paper [27]. We make essential use of the theory of Grothendieck derivators,
which seems to be the most convenient homotopy-theoretic language for this paper. This is not
surprising since none of the equivalences above come from Quillen equivalences of model categories
or equivalences of (∞, 1)-categories.

The general Theorem 4.2.3 in Section 4 which implies Theorem 2 needs the assumption that the
homotopy ring π∗R is concentrated in degrees divisible by some number N ≥ 4. Hence Theorem
4.2.3 does not apply to KU or KU(p), since πmKU is nontrivial for every even m. The strategy
for proving Theorem 1 is to reduce to the case of KO(p). More precisely, we use that

ι : KO(p) → KU(p)

is a C2-Galois extension in the sense of [29]. This implies that the counit of the adjunction

− ∧KO(p) KU(p) : D(KO(p))

/ D(KU(p)) : ι∗

has a natural splitting. By combining the latter with the triangulated equivalence D(KO(p)) ∼
D(π∗KO(p)) for an odd prime p, we get Theorem 1.

Since the homotopy groups of KO(2) and KO are much more involved than those of KO(p) for
an odd p, our methods do not apply in the 2-local or integral case. More precisely, KO(2) and KO
have homotopy groups in odd degrees and the global homological dimension of the homotopy rings
is inﬁnite. We do not know whether the 2-local or integral version of Theorem 1 holds. This still
remains an open problem. We also do not know whether proving the 2-local version of Theorem 1
implies the integral statement since the fracture squares are non-canonical in general triangulated
categories. However, we believe that the method which will solve the problem for KU(2) will most
likely be applicable already integrally.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Graded homological algebra. Let B be a graded ring. We will denote by Grmod-B
the category of graded (right) B-modules. This category is an abelian category and has enough
projective objects. For any graded B-module M , let proj.dim M denote the (graded) projec-
tive dimension of M in Grmod -B. The graded global homological dimension of B, denoted by
gl.dim B, is the supremum of projective dimensions of objects in Grmod -B.

Next, let N ≥ 2 be an integer. We say that a graded ring B is N -sparse if B is concentrated

in degrees divisible by N , i.e., Bk = 0 if k is not congruent to 0 modulo N .

If A is a diﬀerential graded ring, then Mod-A will denote the category of diﬀerential graded

modules over A.

2.2. Stable model categories and triangulated categories. We will freely use in this paper
the language of triangulated categories (see e.g., [14]) and model categories (see e.g., [28, 10, 19]).
For a model category M, we denote by Ho(M) the homotopy category of M. Further, given
objects X and Y of M, the notation [X, Y ] will stand for the set of morphisms in Ho(M) between
X and Y .

Recall that a pointed model category M is called stable if the suspension functor

Σ : Ho(M) → Ho(M)

is an equivalence of categories. For any stable model category M, the homotopy category Ho(M) is
triangulated with Σ the suspension functor [19, 7.1.6]. The distinguished triangles are deﬁned using
mapping cone sequences which we recall now. For simplicity assume that M is a simplicial model
category. Then the suspension can be modeled by the left derived functor of S1 ∧ − : M → M,
where S1 = I/{0, 1} and I denotes the standard simplicial 1-simplex. Next, let f : X → Y be a
map between coﬁbrant objects in M. Consider the pushout diagram

f

X

1∧−

Y

j

CX

/ Cone(f ),

where CX denotes the smash product (I, 0) ∧ X. The natural map (I, 0) ∧ X → S1 ∧ X and the
trivial map ∗ : Y → S1 ∧ X induce by the universal property of pushout a map

∂ : Cone(f ) → S1 ∧ X.

A triangle of the form

is called an elementary distinguished triangle. An abstract triangle

X

/ Y

j

/ Cone(f )

∂

/ S1 ∧ X

A

/ B

/ C

/ ΣA

in Ho(M) is called distinguished (or exact ) if it isomorphic to an elementary distinguished triangle
in Ho(M).

Example 2.2.1. For any ring k, the category Ch(k) of unbounded chain complexes of k-modules
with the projective model structure is a stable model category [19, 2.3.11]. The weak equivalences
and ﬁbrations in this model structure are quasi-isomorphisms (i.e., homology isomorphisms) and
degreewise epimorphisms, respectively.

Example 2.2.2. Let R be a symmetric ring spectrum. The category Mod-R of right R-
modules admits a stable simplicial model structure [20, Corollary 5.5.2]. The homotopy category
Ho(Mod-R) is called the derived category of R, denoted by D(R). Note that R is a compact
generator of D(R) and the representable homological functor associated to R is the homotopy
group functor π∗ : D(R) −→ Grmod-π∗R.

Example 2.2.3. Let A be a diﬀerential graded ring. Then, by Example 2.2.1 and [35, 4.1] (see
also [18]), the category Mod-A of diﬀerential graded right modules over A has a projective model
structure in which the weak equivalences and ﬁbrations are as in 2.2.1. This model structure is
stable as well. The category Ho(Mod-A) is called the derived category of A, denoted by D(A). The
diﬀerential graded module A is a compact generator of D(A) and the representable homological
functor associated to A is the homology H∗ : D(A) −→ Grmod -H∗A.

By [38, 2.15], there is a symmetric ring spectrum HA such that Mod-HA is Quillen equivalent
to Mod-A. In particular, the derived category D(A) is triangulated equivalent to D(HA). Thus,
from the point of view of model category theory Example 2.2.3 is a special case of Example 2.2.2.

Remark 2.2.4. Note that the triangulated structure on the derived category D(A) of a diﬀerential
graded ring A comes from the usual shift functor and algebraic mapping cone construction. More
precisely, for any M ∈ D(A), the suspension of M , denoted by M [1], is given by

M [1]n = Mn−1, dM[1]

n = −dM

n−1.

The object M [1] inherits the structure of a graded right A-module from that of M (the action of
A on M [1] is not twisted by a sign). Furthermore, the diﬀerential dM[1] satisﬁes the Leibniz rule.
Next, let f : M −→ M ′ be a morphism of diﬀerential graded modules over A. The (algebraic)

mapping cone Cone(f ) of f is a diﬀerential graded A-module deﬁned by

(Cone(f ))n = Mn−1 ⊕ M ′

n, n ∈ Z,

d(m, m′) = (−dm, f (m) + dm′).

The object Cone(f ) comes with canonical morphisms of diﬀerential graded modules

ι : M ′ −→ Cone(f ),

ι(m′) = (0, m′)

and

These morphisms together with f : M −→ M ′ form a triangle

∂ : Cone(f ) −→ M [1], ∂(m, m′) = m.

M

f

/ M ′

/ Cone(f )

called the elementary distinguished triangle associated to f .

A triangle in D(A) is distinguished if and only if it is isomorphic to an elementary distinguished

triangle in D(A).

2.3. Adams spectral sequence. We start by recalling the Adams spectral sequence for general
triangulated categories. It can be constructed using the methods of [6]. See also [13, Section 2.1].
We do not provide here details as they are standard.

Proposition 2.3.1 (The Adams spectral sequence). Let T be a triangulated category and A an
abelian category with a given autoequivalence [1] : A → A, enough projectives and ﬁnite global ho-
mological dimension. Suppose that F : T → A is a homological functor with a natural isomorphism
F (ΣX) ∼= F (X)[1]. Further assume that the following two conditions hold:

(i) If C is an object of T and F (C) is projective in A, then the map

F : HomT (C, X) −→ HomA(F (C), F (X))

is an isomorphism for any object X of T .

(ii) For any projective object P in A, there exists G ∈ T such that

holds in A.

F (G) ∼= P

Then there is a bounded convergent spectral sequence

A(F (X), F (Y )[q]) ⇒ HomT (X, Σp+qY ).

Here [q] : A → A denotes the iteration of [1] : A → A (or of its chosen inverse).

Let T be a triangulated category with inﬁnite coproducts and S a compact generator of T .

Consider the functor

and the shift functor

HomT (S, −)∗ : T → Mod-EndT (S)∗

[1] : Grmod-EndT (S)∗ → Grmod-EndT (S)∗,

where HomT (S, −)∗ denotes the graded Hom group HomT (Σ∗S, −) and EndT (S)∗ stands for the
graded endomorphism ring of S. These satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2.3.1 (see e.g., [1,
Lemma 5.17 and Proposition A.4]). Hence Proposition 2.3.1 yields the following:

Corollary 2.3.2. Let T be a triangulated category with inﬁnite coproducts and S a compact
generator of T , and assume that the graded global homological dimension of EndT (S)∗ is ﬁnite.
Then there is a bounded convergent spectral sequence

Epq

2 = Extp

EndT (S)∗

(HomT (S, X)∗, HomT (S, Y )∗[q]) ⇒ HomT (X, Σp+qY ).

In fact, this spectral sequence is a special case of a more general spectral sequence constructed

in [6].

2.4. Franke’s functor. In this subsection we review the construction of Franke’s functor. We
mainly follow [27, 3.3] where the reader can also look up necessary details.

Let M be a simplicial stable model category and S a compact generator of Ho(M). Having
our main examples in mind, for convenience, we will denote by π∗X, the graded morphisms
[S, X]∗ = [Σ∗S, X] in Ho(M). Note that the suspension functor induces a natural isomorphism
π∗(ΣX) ∼= π∗(X)[1].

Now suppose that the graded ring π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse for N ≥ 2 and the graded global

homological dimension of π∗S is less than N . The category Grmod -π∗S splits as follows

Grmod-π∗S ∼ B ⊕ B[1] ⊕ . . . ⊕ B[N − 1],

where B is the full subcategory of Grmod-π∗S consisting of all those modules which are concen-
trated in degrees divisible by N . Next, let CN stand for the poset

For a general diagram X ∈ MCN we denote by

li : Xβi → Xζi,

ki : Xβi−1 → Xζi

i ∈ Z/N Z

the structure morphisms of X.

Deﬁne L to be the full subcategory of Ho(MCN ) consisting of those diagrams X ∈ Ho(MCN )

which satisfy the following conditions:

(i) The objects Xβi and Xζi are coﬁbrant in M for any i ∈ Z/N Z;
(ii) The graded π∗S-modules π∗Xβi and π∗Xζi are objects of B[i] for any i ∈ Z/N Z;
(iii) The map π∗li : π∗Xβi → π∗Xζi is injective for any i ∈ Z/N Z.

In [27, 3.3] the category L is deﬁned using only projectively coﬁbrant diagrams. The condition
(i) above is weaker than being a coﬁbrant diagram.
It allows us more ﬂexibility with certain
constructions in this paper. Since every diagram can be replaced up to weak equivalence by a
projectively coﬁbrant diagram, this minor diﬀerence between the two deﬁnitions does not matter
for the ﬁnal outcome.

Next we recall the deﬁnition of the functor Q : L → Mod-π∗S. For any i ∈ Z/N Z consider the

mapping cone sequence

Xβi−1

ki

/ Xζi

/ Cone(ki)

/ ΣXβi−1.

This sequence induces a long exact sequence

. . . → π∗(Xβi−1) → π∗(Xζi ) → π∗(Cone(ki)) → π∗(Xβi−1)[1] → π∗(Xζi )[1] → . . . .

Since X is an object of L, it follows from the deﬁnition that π∗(Xβi−1) ∈ B[i−1] and π∗(Xζi) ∈ B[i].
Hence the maps π∗(Xβi−1) → π∗(Xζi) and π∗(Xβi−1)[1] → π∗(Xζi )[1] vanish and we get a short
exact sequence

of graded π∗S-modules for any i ∈ Z/N Z. After summing up we get a short exact sequence

0 → π∗(Xζi ) → π∗(Cone(ki)) → π∗(Xβi−1)[1] → 0

0 → M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Xζi ) → M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Cone(ki)) → M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Xβi)[1] → 0.

Using the map

M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗li : M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Xβi) → M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Xζi ),

we can splice the latter short exact sequence with its shifted copy and get a diﬀerential

d : M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Cone(ki)) → M
i∈Z/N Z

π∗(Cone(ki))[1].

Deﬁne the functor Q : L → Mod-π∗S by setting Q(X) = (Li∈Z/N Z π∗(Cone(ki)), d).
Let K denote the full subcategory of L consisting of those objects X which satisfy

proj.dim π∗Xβi < N − 1,

proj.dim π∗Xζi < N − 1

for all i ∈ Z/N Z. The following is proved in [27, 3.3] using the Adams spectral sequence (Corollary
2.3.2):

Proposition 2.4.1. Let M be a simplicial stable model category with a compact generator S of
Ho(M). Suppose that the graded ring π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse for N ≥ 2 and the graded global
homological dimension of π∗S is less than N . Then the restricted functor

Q|K : K → Mod-π∗S

is fully faithful and a diﬀerential graded module (C, d) is in the essential image of Q|K if and only
if

proj.dim Ker d < N − 1

and

proj.dim Im d < N − 1.

In particular, if gl.dim π∗S is less than N − 1, then Q : L → Mod-π∗S is an equivalence of
categories.

Using this proposition we can once and for all choose an inverse Q−1 : Q(K) → K. Denote by

R′ the composite

(Q|K)−1

Q(K)

/ K ⊆ Ho(MCN )

Hocolim

/ Ho(M).

By [27, 3.4] one has a natural isomorphism π∗ ◦ R′ ∼= H∗. Further note that by [18, 2.2.5] every
coﬁbrant diﬀerential graded π∗S-module is underlying projective graded module and hence Q(K)
contains all coﬁbrant objects. Altogether we conclude that R′ gives rise to a functor

R : D(π∗S) → Ho(M)

with a natural isomorphism π∗ ◦ R ∼= H∗. The main results of [27] show that the following hold:
• If gl.dim π∗S = 1 and N ≥ 2, then the functor R : D(π∗S) → Ho(M) is an equivalence

of categories;

• If gl.dim π∗S = 2 and N ≥ 4, then the functor R : D(π∗S) → Ho(M) is an equivalence

of categories.

3. Equivalences of diagram categories and partial morphisms of derivators

In this section we extend the results of [27], recalled above, to diagram categories. We deﬁne
the functor R for certain diagram categories and prove that in some cases it is an equivalence.
We also show that these functors are compatible with change of diagrams.

3.1. The functor R for diagram categories. Let M be a stable model category and S a
compact generator of Ho(M). Let P be a ﬁnite poset. Since the category P is both direct and
inverse in the sense of [19, Section 5.1], the functor category MP admits the projective and
injective model structures [19, Theorem 5.1.3]. The weak equivalences in both model structures
are the levelwise weak equivalences. The ﬁbrations in the projective model structure are levelwise
ﬁbrations and the dual is the case for the injective model structure. For an explicit description of
the projective coﬁbrations and injective ﬁbrations see e.g., [19, Section 5.1]. It follows from the
deﬁnitions that the identity functor

id : MP → MP

is a left Quillen functor from the projective to the injective model structure. Moreover, the identity
adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.

The functor π∗ = [S, −]∗ : M → Grmod-π∗S induces a functor

π∗ : MP → (Grmod-π∗S)P .

This functor sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. Hence it gives rise to a homological functor
on the homotopy category

π∗ : Ho(MP ) → (Grmod -π∗S)P

which reﬂects isomorphisms. The category (Grmod -π∗S)P is an abelian category with enough
projectives (see e.g., [39, Section 2.3]).

The dimension dim P of P is deﬁned to be the dimension of its geometric realization which
coincides with the maximal length of a chain in P. It follows from [25] that the global homological
dimension of the abelian category (Grmod-π∗S)P is at most dim P + gl.dim π∗S. In particular
if gl.dim π∗S is ﬁnite, then the global homological dimension of (Grmod-π∗S)P is also ﬁnite.
Further we have the levelwise shift functor [1] : (Grmod-π∗S)P → (Grmod -π∗S)P which is an
equivalence. Now using the general description of projective objects for diagram abelian categories
(see e.g., [39, Section 2.3]) and the standard idempotent splitting argument (see e.g., [1, Proposition
A.4]), we see that the homological functor π∗ : Ho(MP ) → (Grmod-π∗S)P and the latter shift
satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2.3.1. This gives an Adams spectral sequence for computing
abelian groups of morphisms in Ho(MP ).

Next, assume that π∗S is concentrated in dimensions divisible by a natural number N ≥ 2 and
dim P + gl.dim π∗S < N holds. Exactly as in Subsection 2.4, the category (Grmod-π∗S)P splits
as follows

(Grmod-π∗S)P ∼ BP ⊕ BP[1] ⊕ . . . ⊕ BP[N − 1],

where BP is the full subcategory of (Grmod -π∗S)P consisting of all those P-diagrams which are
levelwise concentrated in degrees divisible by N . Note that by deﬁnition the category BP[i] is
equal to the diagram category (B[i])P . Now the arguments recalled in 2.4 (see Subsections 3.3 and
3.4 of [27] for more details) can be applied mutatis mutandis to MP and hence we can construct
the functor R : Ho((Mod -π∗S)P ) → Ho(MP ). More precisely, let LP denote the full subcategory
of Ho(MP×CN ) consisting of levelwise coﬁbrant objects which after evaluating at any element of P
satisfy the conditions (ii) and (iii) from the deﬁnition of L in Subsection 2.4. One deﬁnes a functor
QP : LP → (Mod-π∗S)P by levelwise repeating the construction of Q. We can also consider the
full subcategory KP of LP which is analogous to K. However, for simplicity from now on we will
assume that dim P + gl.dim π∗S < N − 1. Then KP = LP and the same argument as in [27,
3.3], using the Adams spectral sequence for π∗ : Ho(MP ) → (Grmod -π∗S)P (Proposition 2.3.1),
shows that the functor

QP : LP → (Mod-π∗S)P

is an equivalence of categories. We choose an inverse (QP )−1 once and for all so that

((QP )−1, QP )

8

Irakli Patchkoria

is an adjoint equivalence of categories with (QP )−1 being the left adjoint. Further, the composite

(Mod-π∗S)P

(QP )−1

/ LP ⊆ Ho(MP×CN )

Hocolim

/ Ho(MP )

induces the functor R : Ho((Mod-π∗S)P ) → Ho(MP ) and there is a natural isomorphism π∗◦R ∼=
H∗. For any P, we keep the same symbol R for denoting the latter functor in order to simplify
notation.

Finally, another verbatim translation of the arguments from [27, Section 6] shows that the

following holds:

Theorem 3.1.1. Suppose we are given the following data: A (simplicial) stable model category M,
a compact generator S of Ho(M) and a ﬁnite poset P. Assume that the graded ring π∗S = [S, S]∗
is N -sparse for N ≥ 4 and dim P + gl.dim π∗S ≤ 2. Then the functor

is an equivalence of categories.

R : Ho((Mod-π∗S)P ) → Ho(MP )

3.2. Compatibility with change of diagrams and the derivator structure. In this subsec-
tion we show that the functors R are compatible with change of diagrams. Suppose we are given
an order preserving map u : P1 → P2 of posets. Then the pullback functor

u∗ : M P2 → M P1

preserves weak equivalences. Further it has a left adjoint u! : M P1 → M P2 and a right adjoint
u∗ : M P1 → M P2, called the left and right Kan extensions. Since the functor u∗ preserves lewelvise
notions, it follows that (u!, u∗) is a Quillen adjunction with respect to the projetive model struc-
tures and (u∗, u∗) is a Quillen adjunction with respect to the injective model structures. These
adjunctions pass to homotopy categories and we denote the derived functors with the same symbols
as the point set level functors.

Before we discuss the compatibility of R with latter change of diagram functors, we need to

brieﬂy review calculus of mates [21] (see also [17, Section 1.2]).

Consider a diagram

of categories. The arrow in the middle of the square indicates that we are given a natural trans-
formation α : vu2 → u1w. Suppose ui! is left adjoint to ui, i = 1, 2. Then α induces a natural
transformation

α! : u1!v → u1!vu2u2! → u1!u1wu2! → wu2!,

where the middle map is u1!αu2! and the ﬁrst and last map are induced by the unit of (u2!, u2)
and the counit of (u1!, u1), respectively. The map α! is referred to as one of the possible two mates
of α (the other one is deﬁned using right adjoints of v and w in case they exist). This construction
is compatible with pasting of natural transformations. More precisely, suppose we are given a
diagram of categories

The derived category of complex periodic K-theory localized at an odd prime

Now suppose for i = 1, 2, 3, the functor ui has a left adjoint ui!. Then (α ⊙ α′)! = α′
! ⊙ α! (see
e.g., [17, Lemma 1.14]). Moreover, the pasting operation is associative and the vertical pasting
and horizontal pasting commute with each other (see e.g., [11, 12, 15]).

In what follows we will use certain structure on the collection of diagram categories

If M is a combinatorial model category, then the assignment

C 7→ Ho(MC),

P 7→ Ho(MP ).

where C is any small category, deﬁnes a derivator (see [7] and [17, Proposition 1.30]). The struc-
ture of a derivator axiomatizes the derived change of diagram functors and the existence of the
homotopy (derived) left and right Kan extensions. We will assume familiarity with the theory of
derivators. Sources on derivators include [13, 17, 24].

In this paper we only need the portion of the derivator structure which is indexed on ﬁnite
posets. The advantage when working with posets is that one does not have to assume anything
additional on the model category M to have homotopy Kan extensions

u! : Ho(M P1 ) → Ho(M P2),

u∗ : Ho(M P1 ) → Ho(M P2)

for a map u : P1 → P2 of ﬁnite posets. Since the category of ﬁnite posets satisﬁes the axioms of a
category of diagrams in the sense of [8], the theory from [17] applies to the derivator P 7→ Ho(MP )
deﬁned on ﬁnite posets (see [17, End of Section 1.1]).

Now we start establishing some compatibility results of the funtors R with change of diagrams.
Let M be a (simplicial) stable model category, S a compact generator of Ho(M) and assume
that the graded ring π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse. Further, let P1 and P2 be ﬁnite posets such that
dim Pi + gl.dim π∗S < N − 1, i = 1, 2, and u : P1 → P2 an order preserving map of posets.
Then by construction we have the identity natural transformation idu : u∗QP2 = QP1(u × 1)∗.
Schematically we have the diagram

(Mod-π∗S)P1

LP1

✌✌✌✌

(u×1)∗

(Mod-π∗S)P2

QP2

where the middle arrow is the identity natural transformation (i.e., the diagram commutes). Since
by our choice (QPi )−1 is left adjoint to QPi, i = 1, 2, we get a mate natural transformation
(idu)! : (QP1 )−1u∗ → (u × 1)∗(QP2 )−1. This natural transformation is a natural isomorphism
since ((QPi)−1, QPi) is an adjoint equivalence of categories, i = 1, 2, and idu is an isomorphism.
(Note that even if idu is the identity, the natural transformation (idu)! in general is not the
identity.) By pasting

map of posets. Then the natural transformation γu : Ru∗ → u∗R is a natural isomorphism.

Then the diagram

Since pasting is compatible with taking mates, the pasted natural transformation (idv)! ⊙ (idu)! is
equal to (idvu)!. Next, the right vertical pasting of the canonical natural transformations in the
above diagram gives the canonical natural transformation

Hocolim((vu × 1)∗) → (vu)∗ Hocolim .

This follows by a similar argument as the latter one or using the fact that

Hocolim : Ho(M(−)×CN ) → Ho(M(−))

is a morphism of derivators [17, Example 2.10].

The arguments above show that by ﬁrst vertically pasting and then horizontally we get the
natural transformation γvu (after passing to the derived categories). On the other hand, by
deﬁnition, if we ﬁrst horizontally paste and then vertically we get the natural transformation
u∗γv ◦ γuv∗ (after passing to the derived categories). But since it does not matter in which order
we paste for the ﬁnal outcome, one gets the desired result.

This can be seen by an explicit check or again using the fact that

Hocolim : Ho(M(−)×CN ) → Ho(M(−))

is a morphism of derivators. Now by combining the latter two commutative diagrams and passing
to the derived categories, we get the desired result.
(cid:3)

This proposition implies that the functors

R : Ho((Mod-π∗S)P ) → Ho(MP )

almost assemble into a morphism of derivators (see e.g., [17, Section 2.1]) except that they are only
deﬁned if dim P + gl.dim π∗S < N − 1. In other words, these functors form a partial morphism
of derivators.

4. Triangulated structures

In this section we will show that in certain cases the functor R preserves distinguished triangles.
Our strategy is to use the fact that distinguished triangles in Ho(M) can be completely described
by the derivator structure on Ho(M(−)) and then apply the previous section to get the desired
result.

4.1. Constructing distinguished triangles. The construction of triangles in terms of deriva-
tors classically uses a poset of dimension three (see e.g., [13, 24] and [17, Section 4.2]). Since
we have restrictions on homological dimensions, it is not convenient for us to consider diagram
categories indexed on posets of dimensions more than one.
In this section we reformulate the
construction of distinguished triangles completely in terms of one dimensional posets. Note that
this reformulation is already mentioned in [13, Remark 2 of Section 1.4]. However, no details are
given there.

First we recall the deﬁnition of the mapping cone functor. Let M be a stable model category
and [1] denote the poset with elements 0 and 1 and the relation 0 ≤ 1. Further consider the poset

(0, 0)

(1, 0)

(0, 1)

denoted by p. Let ι : [1] → p be the functor (i.e., order preserving map) which sends 0 to (0, 0)
and 1 to (1, 0). In other words, ι includes the interval [1] into p as the top horizontal line. Further,
let (cid:3) denote the poset

(0, 0)

(1, 0)

(0, 1)

/ (1, 1)

and ip : p→ (cid:3) the obvious inclusion. Finally, we will also use the functor j : [1] → (cid:3) which includes
the interval [1] as the right vertical arrow inside (cid:3). The mapping cone functor Cone: Ho(M[1]) →
Ho(M[1]) is then deﬁned as the composite (see e.g., [17, Deﬁnition 3.18]):

Ho(M[1])

ι∗

/ Ho(Mp)

(ip)!

/ Ho(M(cid:3))

j∗

/ Ho(M[1]).

This deﬁnition of the mapping cone functor uses the poset (cid:3) which has dimension two. We would
like to reformulate the latter deﬁnition in terms of one dimensional diagrams. This is possible
since the functor j : [1] → (cid:3) has a left adjoint p : (cid:3) → [1] which sends the top vertices of (cid:3) to
0 and the lower vertices of (cid:3) to 1. Indeed, the functor j∗ : Ho(M(cid:3)) → Ho(M[1]) is left adjoint
to p∗ : Ho(M [1]) → Ho(M(cid:3)). Let ω : p→ [1] denote the composite p ◦ ip. Then the homotopy
left Kan extension ω! : Ho(Mp) → Ho(M[1]) is naturally isomorphic to the composite of the left
adjoints of (ip)∗ and p∗. But the latter is isomorphic to the composite j∗(ip)! and hence we can
redeﬁne the cone functor Cone: Ho(M[1]) → Ho(M[1]) to be the composite:

Ho(M[1])

ι∗

/ Ho(Mp)

ω!

/ Ho(M[1]).

From this point on by the cone functor we will always mean the latter composite.

Next, we recall the deﬁnition of the suspension functor Σ : Ho(M) → Ho(M). Consider the
functors in0, in1 : ∗ → [1] which include the point as 0 and 1 respectively into [1]. Then the
suspension functor is deﬁned as the composite:

Ho(M)

(in0)∗

/ Ho(M[1])

Cone

/ Ho(M[1])

in∗
1

/ Ho(M).

It follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that this functor is naturally isomorphic to the sus-
pension functor deﬁned in [19, 7.1.6].

Next, we recall the deﬁnition of the underlying arrow functor (see e.g., [17]): The unique
natural transformation in0 → in1 induces a natural transformation in∗
0 and in∗
1
are functors from Ho(M[1]) to Ho(M). These functors and the natural transformation assemble
into a single functor dia[1] : Ho(M[1]) → Ho(M)[1]. It follows for example from [17, Lemma 1.9]
In particular, given an object f ∈ Ho(M[1]), one
that dia[1] is full and essentially surjective.
obtains a morphism

1, where in∗

0 → in∗

in∗

0(f )

dia[1](f )

/ in∗

1(f )

and every other morphism in Ho(M) is isomorphic to such a morphism. Hence we can deﬁne
distinguished triangles in Ho(M) by only using the morphisms of type dia[1](f ) for some object f
in Ho(M[1]).

We are now almost ready to recall the deﬁnition of distinguished triangles in terms of the
derivator structure of Ho(M(−)). For this we need to observe that the target of dia[1](f ) is
naturally isomorphic to the source of Cone(f ). This follows by deﬁnitions. However, since this
isomorphism is built in in the deﬁnition of the distinguished triangles, we would like to make
it more explicit. The isomorphism is given in terms of restriction and homotopy Kan extension
functors. As advertised, the diagrams involved in the construction will be only one dimensional.

It follows from [17, Proposition 1.18] that the mate (id)! associated to the second square is an

in the latter diagram is also an isomorphism because the square

(cid:3)

Finally, we are ready to redeﬁne the distinguished triangles. In order to be consistent we have
to once and for all ﬁx models for the homotopy left and right Kan extensions for the derivator
Ho(M(−)). The homotopy Kan extensions are only uniquely deﬁned up to canonical isomor-
phisms, since adjoints for a given functor are. Any such choice of Kan extensions leads to a
triangulated structure on Ho(M). The triangulated category structures on Ho(M) associated to
diﬀerent choices of adjoints are equivalent as triangulated categories via the identity functor and
the canonical isomorphism between diﬀerent suspension functors.

0(Cone(f )), the deﬁnition of the suspension

If M is a simplicial stable model category or the model category of diﬀerential graded modules
over a diﬀerential graded ring (see Subsection 2.2), then the choices of the left and right homotopy
Kan extensions can be done in such a way that a triangle in Ho(M) is distinguished in the sense
of Subsection 2.2 if and only if it is isomorphic in Ho(M) to an elementary homotopy triangle.
The following is a consequence of [17, Theorem 4.16] and [19, Section 7.1] and summarizes the

Proposition 4.1.3. Suppose M is any of the stable model categories from Subsection 2.2.

(i) For any ﬁxed choice of homotopy Kan extensions (for relevant one dimensional diagrams),
the suspension functor and the elementary homotopy triangles deﬁne a triangulated category struc-
ture on Ho(M). A triangle in Ho(M) is distinguished with respect to this structure if and only
if it is isomorphic in Ho(M) to an elementary homotopy triangle. Up to triangulated equivalence
this triangulated structure does not depend on the choice of homotopy Kan extensions.

(ii) One can choose necessary homotopy Kan extensions in such a way that the associated
triangulated structure on Ho(M) coming from the elementary homotopy triangles coincides with
the one deﬁned in [19, Section 7.1].

From now on we will once and for all ﬁx the choices and the triangulated structure from
Proposition 4.1.3 (ii) on Ho(M). In particular, when checking that a functor F : Ho(M) → Ho(N )
is triangulated, it suﬃces to show that F preserves up to isomorphism of triangles the elementary
homotopy triangles. This observation will be used in the next subsection.

4.2. Preserving distinguished triangles. In this subsection we assume that M is a simplicial
stable model category with a compact generator S of Ho(M) such that π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse.
We will also assume that N ≥ 4 and gl.dim π∗S = 1. Our main example which satisﬁes these
conditions is the model category Mod-KO(p) of modules over periodic real K-theory localized at
an odd prime p.

By Theorem 3.1.1, for any poset P whose dimension is at most one, the functor

R : Ho((Mod-π∗S)P ) → Ho(MP )

is an equivalence of categories. Further, Proposition 3.2.1 and Proposition 3.2.2 tell us that
these equivalences are compatible with functors between posets of dimension at most one and
their natural transformations. This together with the description of distinguished triangles in the
previous subsection will imply that the functor

R : D(π∗S) = Ho(Mod -π∗S) → Ho(M)

is a triangulated equivalence of triangulated categories.

The ﬁrst thing to show is that the R functors are compatible with the underlying arrow functors
dia[1]. Let α : in0 → in1 denote the unique natural transformation of the functors in0, in1 : ∗ → [1].
It follows from Proposition 3.2.2 (ii) that the diagram

commutes. Here in the upper arrow the symbol R stands for the functor R : Ho(Mod-π∗S) →
Ho(M) and in the lower arrow for the functor R : Ho((Mod -π∗S)[1]) → Ho(M[1]). By deﬁnition
of the functor dia[1], the latter commutative diagram implies that for any f ∈ Ho((Mod -π∗S)[1]),
the diagram

commutes. Recall also that by Proposition 3.2.1 the vertical arrows are isomorphisms in this
diagram. We will prove bellow that in fact the elementary homotopy triangle associated to an
object f of Ho((Mod -π∗S)[1]) is mapped under R to a triangle isomorphic to the elementary
homotopy triangle associated to R(f ) ∈ Ho(M[1]). Since elementary homotopy triangles were
deﬁned using homotopy Kan extensions, we have to check that the R functors commute with
relevant homotopy Kan extensions.

The following proposition follows for example from [17, Proposition 2.9]. We still provide details
here because compared to the standard derivator literature, we have restrictions on dimensions of
diagrams.

Proposition 4.2.1. Let M be a simplicial stable model category and S a compact generator of
Ho(M). Suppose that π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse for some N ≥ 4 and gl.dim π∗S = 1. Further,
let u : P1 → P2 be an order preserving map of at most one dimensional posets. Then the following
hold:

(i) The mate βu = (γu)! : u!R → Ru! is a natural isomorphism. (The same applies to γ−1

u and
the right homotopy Kan extensions and hence we also have a natural isomorphism δu : Ru∗ →
u∗R.)

(ii) The functors R are compatible with units and counits of homotopy Kan extensions. E.g.,

the diagram

u!Ru∗

u!γu

u!u∗R

βuu∗

εuR

/ Ru!u∗

Rεu

/ R

commutes and similar diagrams for other counit and units also commute.

Proof. (i) Recall that βu = (γu)! is deﬁned as the composite

u!R

u!Rηu

/ u!Ru∗u!

u!γuu!

/ u!u∗Ru!

εuRu!

/ Ru!,

where ηu is the unit. The functors R are equivalences of categories by Theorem 3.1.1. One
can choose the inverse R−1 and consider R as a left adjoint functor to R−1. Then forming the
second mate associated to the natural isomorphism γu : Ru∗ → u∗R gives a natural isomorphism
u∗R−1 → R−1u∗. This implies the desired result since βu is conjugate to the latter natural
transformation (see e.g., [17, Lemma 1.14]).

(ii) This part follows from the commutative diagram:

u!Ru∗u!u∗

u!Ru∗εu

u!Rηuu∗

8qqqqqqqqqq

u!Ru∗

u!Ru∗

u!γuu!u∗

/ u!u∗Ru!u∗

εuRu!u∗

/ Ru!u∗

u!γu

/ u!u∗R

εuR

Rεu

/ R.

The right hand square commutes since the lower horizontal composition is a natural transforma-
tion. The left hand triangle commutes because of one of the triangular identities of the adjunction
(u!, u∗).
(cid:3)

Now recall that in the previous subsection the mapping cone functor was deﬁned as the com-
posite ω!ι∗. Since [1] and p are one dimensional posets, Proposition 4.2.1 (i) applies to ι and ω.
Hence we conclude that there is a canonical isomorphism

c : R Cone

∼=

/ Cone R.

This isomorphism is obtained by combining the canonical isomorphisms δι : Rι∗ ∼= ι∗R and
βω : ω!R ∼= Rω! coming from Proposition 4.2.1 (i). The following is a corollary of Proposition
3.2.2 (i) and Proposition 4.2.1 (ii):

Corollary 4.2.2. The diagram (consisting of natural isomorphisms)

The derived category of complex periodic K-theory localized at an odd prime

Proof. The natural isomorphism ζ is deﬁned in terms of the homotopy Kan extensions. This
implies the desired result.
(cid:3)

Another corollary of Proposition 4.2.1 is that the functor

R : D(π∗S) = Ho(Mod -π∗S) → Ho(M)

commutes with suspensions. Indeed, deﬁne a : RΣ → ΣR to be the following composite:

R in∗

1 Cone(in0)∗

γin1 (Cone(in0)∗)

/ in∗

R Cone(in0)∗

in∗

1 (c(in0)∗)

/ in∗

1 Cone R(in0)∗

in∗
1

Cone(δin0 )

/ in∗

1 Cone(in0)∗R.

All the arrows in this composite are isomorphisms and hence so is a : RΣ → ΣR.

Finally, we are ready to show that the functor R : D(π∗S) = Ho(Mod-π∗S) → Ho(M) is

triangulated. This is the main result of the section:

Theorem 4.2.3. Let M be a simplicial stable model category and S a compact generator of
Ho(M). Suppose that π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse for some N ≥ 4 and gl.dim π∗S = 1. Then the
functor

together with the natural isomorphism a : RΣ ∼= ΣR is a triangulated equivalence.

R : D(π∗S) = Ho(Mod -π∗S) → Ho(M)

Proof. That the functor R is an equivalence of categories is for example proved in [27, Theorem
3.1.4] (see Subsection 2.4). We will now show that it is compatible with distinguished triangles.
By Proposition 4.1.3 it suﬃces to check that R preserves elementary homotopy triangles. More
precisely, the desired result will follow if we prove that for any f ∈ Ho((Mod-π∗S)[1]), the following
diagram commutes:

R(in∗

0(f ))

γin0

in∗

0(R(f ))

/ Σ(in∗

Recall that the vertical morphisms are isomorphisms and the lower sequence is the elementary
homotopy triangle associated to R(f ) ∈ Ho(M[1]).

We start by reminding the reader that we have already checked that the left square commutes.
Indeed, this is just the compatibility of the R functors with dia[1]. Next, we observe that the
diagram

R(in∗

0(Cone(f )))

R(dia[1](Cone(f )))

/ R(in∗

1(Cone(f )))

γin0 (Cone(f ))

γin1 (Cone(f ))

in∗

commutes. The upper square commutes because of the compatibility between R and dia[1]. The
lower square commutes since the morphism in∗
1 is natural. The latter commutative diagram
together with Corollary 4.2.2 implies that the middle square in the main comparison diagram is
commutative.

4.3. Examples. In this subsection we list some examples to which Theorem 4.2.3 applies.

Example 4.3.1. Let p be an odd prime. Consider the p-local real periodic K-theory spectrum
KO(p). The spectrum KO(p) admits an A∞-structure (even an E∞-structure). The homotopy
ring π∗KO(p) is isomorphic to the graded Laurent polynomial ring Z(p)[v, v−1], where the element
v has degree 4. Hence the graded global homological dimension of π∗KO(p) is equal to 1 and
it is concentrated in degrees divisible by 4. This implies that the model category Mod-KO(p)
together with the compact generator KO(p) ∈ D(KO(p)) satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 4.2.3
(see Example 2.2.2). We conclude that the functor

R : D(Z(p)[v, v−1]) → D(KO(p))

realizes a triangulated equivalence. Finally, we note that the model categories Mod-KO(p) and
Mod-Z(p)[v, v−1] are not Quillen equivalent, since the inﬁnite loop space BO(p) of KO(p) is not
a product of Eilenberg-MacLance spaces (see e.g., [27, Corollary A.1.3]).

Example 4.3.2. Let p be a prime and n a positive integer. Assume that either p is odd or
n 6= 1. Consider the connective Morava K-theory spectrum k(n) at the prime p. According to
[22], the spectrum k(n) admits an A∞-structure. The homotopy ring π∗k(n) is isomorphic to the
graded polynomial algebra Fp[vn], where the degree of vn is equal to 2(pn − 1). This implies that
Mod-k(n) and the compact generator k(n) ∈ D(k(n)) satisfy the conditions of Theorem 4.2.3.
Hence we conclude that if either p is odd or n 6= 1, then the functor

R : D(Fp[vn]) → D(k(n))

is a triangulated equivalence. If p = 2 and n = 1, then the functor R is an equivalence of categories
([27, Example 5.3.2]), but it still remains open whether R is triangulated.

We again note that this triangulated equivalence does not come from a Quillen equivalence (see

e.g., Example 5.3.2 of [27]).

Example 4.3.3. Let p be an odd prime again. Then the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(1) at the
prime p (also known as the periodic Adams summand) gives another example to which Theorem
4.2.3 applies. Indeed, we know that E(1) admits an A∞-structure (see e.g., [22]) and we have an
isomorphism of graded rings

π∗E(1) ∼= Z(p)[v1, v−1
1 ],

where v1 has degree 2(p − 1). Hence, by Theorem 4.2.3, the functor

R : D(Z(p)[v1, v−1

1 ]) → D(E(1))

is a triangulated equivalence. Once again we observe that the corresponding model categories
Mod-Z(p)[v1, v−1

1 ] and Mod-E(1) are not Quillen equivalent (see [27, Example 4.3.2]).

5. The derived category of KU(p) for an odd prime p

In this section we prove the main result. We show that for any odd prime p, the equivalence

R : D(π∗KU(p)) → D(KU(p))

is triangulated. Note that Theorem 4.2.3 cannot be applied directly to Mod-KU(p), since
∼= Z(p)[u, u−1], |u| = 2, is only 2-sparse. The idea is to descend to KO(p) whose ho-
π∗KU(p)
motopy groups are 4-sparse, apply Theorem 4.2.3 to Mod-KO(p) and then ascend back to KU(p).
The fact that p is odd is essentially used in our argument here, since π∗KO(2) has inﬁnite homo-
logical dimension and Theorem 4.2.3 does not apply to Mod-KO(2). Whether the equivalence
R : D(π∗KU(2)) → D(KU(2)) is triangulated remains still open.

5.1. The Galois extension KO(p) → KU(p). We will work in this section in the convenient
model category of commutative algebra spectra in the sense of [37]. The main point of this model
structure is that a coﬁbration of commutative R-algebras over a commutative symmetric ring
spectrum R, is also a coﬁbration of underlying R-modules. This model structure is also known
with diﬀerent names like the R-model structure or the positive ﬂat model structure.
In what
follows the words coﬁbrant and coﬁbration will refer to the notions in this model structure.

Fix a coﬁbrant commutative symmetric ring spectrum model for KO(p). The complexiﬁca-
tion map gives a map of commutative symmetric ring spectra ι : KO(p) → KU(p). Without loss
of generality we may assume that this map is a coﬁbration of commutative KO(p)-algebras, or
equivalently KU(p) is a coﬁbrant commutative KO(p)-algebra.

The commutative ring map ι : KO(p) → KU(p) is in fact a C2-Galois extension in the sense of
[29] (see [29, Proposition 5.3.1]). We do not really fully need this fact but rather just a consequence
of it. By Lemma 9.1.2 of [29], every Galois extension of commutative ring spectra with a discrete
Galois group is a separable extension and thus ι : KO(p) → KU(p) is a separable extension. The
latter means that the multiplication map

which is a map of KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p)-modules has a section σ : KU(p) → KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p) in
the derived category D(KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p)). This implies the following:

µ : KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p) → KU(p)

Proposition 5.1.1. The counit of the adjunction

− ∧KO(p) KU(p) : D(KO(p))

/ D(KU(p)) : ι∗

has a natural splitting in D(KU(p)). In other words, for any coﬁbrant KU(p)-module X, the counit

εX : X ∧KO(p) KU(p) → X

has a section sX : X → X ∧KO(p) KU(p) in D(KU(p)) (i.e., εXsX = 1 in D(KU(p))) and sX is
natural with respect to morphisms in D(KU(p)).

Proof. As already indicated above, this is a formal consequence of the fact that the extension
ι : KO(p) → KU(p) is separable. Indeed, for any coﬁbrant KU(p)-module X, we have a functor

X ∧KU(p) − : D(KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p)) → D(KU(p)).

Observe that there are canonical isomorphisms

X ∧KU(p) (KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p)) ∼= X ∧KO(p) KU(p)

and

X ∧KU(p) KU(p)

∼= X

in D(KU(p)). From here one can see that the functor X ∧KU(p) − sends the multiplication map
µ : KU(p) ∧KO(p) KU(p) → KU(p) up to a natural isomorphism to the counit

Deﬁne sX as the composite

εX : X ∧KO(p) KU(p) → X.

Proof. Since the functor ι∗ is exact, one part of the claim is straightforward. The other part
follows from Proposition 5.1.1 together with the facts that − ∧KO(p) KU(p) is exact and a retract
of a distinguished triangle is distinguished.

(cid:3)

Remark 5.1.3. We note that the proof of the above proposition can be applied to any separable
extension. This implies that for any separable extension, the derived counit of the change of scalars
adjunction has a natural splitting.

5.2. Proof of the main result. Let p be an odd prime throughout. In this subsection we show
that the diagram

D(π∗KU(p))

ι∗

D(π∗KO(p))

R

R

/ D(KU(p))

ι∗

/ D(KO(p))

commutes up to a natural isomorphism which is compatible with suspensions. This will imply the
desired result by Corollary 5.1.2 since the vertical functors are well-known to be triangulated and
the lower horizontal functor is triangulated by Theorem 4.2.3 (see Example 4.3.1).

Before showing that the diagram commutes, we will make the suspension isomorphisms more

explicit. The natural isomorphism

a : RΣ ∼= ΣR

for R : D(π∗KO(p)) → D(KO(p)) was constructed using the derivator structure. It was essential
that we could extend R to a partial morphism of derivators deﬁned on one dimensional diagrams.
However, one cannot use the same strategy to construct a suspension isomorphism for the functor
R : D(π∗KU(p)) → D(KU(p)) since π∗KU(p) is only 2-sparse and the results of Section 4 do not
apply to this case. Instead we have to employ the suspension isomorphism described in [27, Propo-
sition 3.5.1] which works in more general settings. This isomorphism is constructed as follows: Let
M be a simplicial stable model category with a compact generator S ∈ Ho(M). Suppose that the
graded ring π∗S = [S, S]∗ is N -sparse for N ≥ 2 and the graded global homological dimension of
π∗S is less than N . Under these conditions, we have Franke’s functor

R : D(π∗S) → Ho(M)

and the natural isomorphism π∗ ◦ R ∼= H∗ (see Subsection 2.4). The full subcategory K of
Ho(MCN ) has an autoequivalence # : K → K. The functor # suspends and rotates once an
object of K. More precisely,

X #
βi

= S1 ∧ Xβi−1,

X #
ζi

= S1 ∧ Xζi−1,

k#
i = S1 ∧ ki−1,

l#
i = S1 ∧ li−1,

i ∈ Z/N Z.

By the construction of the functor Q : K → Mod-π∗S, the suspension isomorphism for π∗(−)
gives a natural isomorphism

ξ′ : [1] ◦ Q

∼=

coming from the deﬁnition of the homotopy colimit. Now recall that we made a choice of the

we get a natural transformation ξ′′ ⊙ (ξ′)! which induces a natural isomorphism

after passing to the derived categories.

If we apply this construction to Mod-KU(p) and Mod-KO(p), we get natural isomorphisms
ξKU : R ◦ [1] ∼= Σ ◦ R and ξKO : R ◦ [1] ∼= Σ ◦ R. On the other hand, we also have the natural
isomorphism

a : RΣ ∼= ΣR

for KO(p), constructed in Subsection 4.2. By Theorem 4.2.3, the functor

R : D(π∗KO(p)) → D(KO(p))

together with the natural isomorphism a : RΣ ∼= ΣR is a triangulated equivalence. In order to be
able to show that the equivalence

R : D(π∗KU(p)) → D(KU(p))

is triangulated, we have to relate the natural transformation ξKU with the natural transformation
a. We will see below how ξKU corresponds to ξKO under the restriction functor

ι∗ : D(KU(p)) → D(KO(p)).

This leaves us with the task to see a connection between ξKO and a. By Proposition 4.1.3 (ii) the
suspensions deﬁned in Subsection 2.2 and the derivator-theoretic suspensions from Subsection 4.1
coincide. In other words, we have

and

Σ = [1] : D(π∗KO(p)) → D(π∗KO(p))

Σ = S1 ∧ − : D(KO(p)) → D(KO(p)).

We remind the reader that this can be achieved by appropriately choosing the left and right homo-
topy Kan extensions in the derivator structure of given model categories. Now once again one can
choose appropriately Q−1 in the construction of R and show explicitly that ξKO and a coincide.
However, this is another lengthy calculation which will overload the paper with unnecessary tech-
nicalities. Instead we show using much more conceptual methods that the natural transformations
ξKO and a only diﬀer up to a ﬁxed unit in Z(p). This is a weaker statement but it is enough for our
purposes. The desired result about the connection between ξKO and a now immediately follows
from the proposition below which we believe is of independent interest.

Theorem 5.2.1. Let p be an odd prime. The automorphism group (of not necessarily triangulated
natural automorphisms) of the identity functor 1 : D(KO(p)) → D(KO(p)) is isomorphic to the
group of units Z×

(p).

Proof. The proof is based on the fact that the graded global homological dimension of π∗KO(p)
is equal to 1. By Corollary 2.3.2 we have the universal coeﬃcient exact sequence for any KO(p)-
modules X and Y :

0

/ Ext1

π∗KO(p)

(π∗X[1], π∗Y )

/ [X, Y ]

π∗

/ Homπ∗KO(p) (π∗X, π∗Y )

/ 0.

The universal coeﬃcient exact sequence implies that for any object X ∈ D(KO(p)), there is a
splitting in D(KO(p))

X ∼= X0 ∨ X1 ∨ X2 ∨ X3,

where for any i, the graded module π∗Xi is concentrated in degrees congruent to i modulo 4.
Given now a natural automorphism λ : 1 → 1 of the identity functor, the strategy is to show that
it is constant for objects whose homotopy groups are concentrated in degrees congruent to a ﬁxed
i modulo 4. Then we have to show that these constants coincide for diﬀerent congruence classes
modulo 4.

By adjunction the endomorphism ring [KO(p), KO(p)]0 is isomorphic to the ring π0KO(p). The
latter is isomorphic to Z(p). Hence any automorphism of KO(p) in D(KO(p)) is given by a unit
in Z(p). In particular, the automorphism λKO(p) : KO(p) → KO(p) is equal to c0 = c0 · 1KO(p) for
some c0 ∈ Z×
(p). We will now show that for any KO(p)-module X, the morphism λX is equal to
c0 = c0 · 1X .

First suppose that π∗X is concentrated in degrees divisible by 4. The universal coeﬃcient

formula implies that

π∗ : [X, X] → Homπ∗KO(p) (π∗X, π∗X)

is an isomorphism. Since π∗KO(p)
Homπ∗KO(p) (π∗X, π∗X) is isomorphic to HomZ(π0X, π0X). Hence, one concludes that

∼= Z(p)[v, v−1], where v has degree 4, it follows that the group

π0 : [X, X] → HomZ(π0X, π0X)

is an isomorphism and in order to show that λX = c0, it suﬃces to prove that π0(λX ) = c0. This
follows from the naturality of λ. Indeed, take any x ∈ π0X. We can represent x by a morphism
x : KO(p) → X (denoted by the same symbol x) in D(KO(p)). Since λ is a natural transformation,
the diagram

π0KO(p)

(λKO(p)

)∗

π0KO(p)

x∗

x∗

π0X

(λX )∗

/ π0X

commutes. We compute

(λX )∗(x) = (λX )∗(x∗(1)) = x∗((λKO(p) )∗(1)) = x∗(c0) = c0 · x.

This shows that λX = c0 if X is such that π∗X is concentrated in degrees divisible by 4. Similarly,
using the fact that for any i ∈ {1, 2, 3} the endomorphism ring of ΣiKO(p) is isomorphic to
π0KO(p) = Z(p) and the fact that πi is represented by ΣiKO(p), we can conclude that λX = ci,
for a constant ci ∈ Z×

(p), if π∗X is concentrated in degrees congruent to i modulo 4.

Next, one needs to show that all the constants are the same, i.e.,

We will only show that c0 = c1 since the other identities are proved similarly. Suppose we are
given X0 and X1, such that π∗Xi is concentrated in degrees congruent to i modulo 4 and i = 0, 1.

c0 = c1 = c2 = c3.

The universal coeﬃcient exact sequence and periodicity tells us that [X0, X1] is isomorphic to
Ext1
n =
c0 − c1, for m, n ∈ Z. The numerator m also annihilates Ext1
Z(π0X0, π1X1). We will now show
that m is inﬁnitely divisible by p which will imply that m = 0 and hence c0 − c1 = 0.

Z(π0X0, π1X1), implying that c0 − c1 annihilates the Ext group Ext1

Z(π0X0, π1X1). Let m

Consider the KO(p)-module M (pl) ∧ KO(p), for any l ≥ 1, where M (pl) is the mod pl Moore
spectrum. Then the homotopy groups of M (pl) ∧ KO(p) are concentrated in degrees divisible by
4. One has,

Ext1

Z(π0(M (pl) ∧ KO(p)), π1(ΣKO(p))) ∼= Ext1

Z(Z/plZ, Z(p)) ∼= Z/plZ.

Thus the numerator m of c0 − c1 annihilates Z/plZ for any l. Hence m is inﬁnitely divisible by p,
implying that it is zero.

Let c denote the common value c0 = c1 = c2 = c3. Take any KO(p)-module X and consider

the splitting

X ∼= X0 ∨ X1 ∨ X2 ∨ X3,

described at the beginning of the proof. By naturality, the diagram

us that λXi = c for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Hence λX = c.

Remark 5.2.2. The reader will notice from the proof that the latter theorem is much more
general than it is presented here. First of all, there is no need to restrict to automorphisms.
Any endomorphism of the identity functor is also given by multiplication on a (not necessarily
invertible) number. Further, a similar theorem holds for more general ring spectra than KO(p).
For example, it also holds for KU(p) or KU . We will not use any of these observations in this
paper and therefore do not go into details.

Proposition 5.2.3. Let p be an odd prime. The diagram of categories

D(π∗KU(p))

commutes up to a natural isomorphism.

Proof. We remind the reader that we have chosen the map ι : KO(p) → KU(p) so that it is a
coﬁbration of commutative KO(p)-algebras in the sense of [37]. In particular, KU(p) is coﬁbrant
when considered as a KO(p)-module via the map ι. For convenience, we denote from now on the
functor

by RKU and the functor

denoted by R′
consisting of diagrams X ∈ Ho((Mod-KU(p))C2 ) satisfying the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) from
Subsection 2.4 and for which additionally π∗KU(p)-modules π∗(Xζ0 ), π∗(Xζ1 ), π∗(Xβ0) and π∗(Xβ1)
are projective. Similarly the full subcategory KKO of Ho((Mod-KO(p))C4 ) consists of those dia-
grams Y which satisfy the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) from Subsection 2.4 and for which π∗(Yζi )
and π∗(Yβi), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, are projective π∗KO(p)-modules.

KU and R′

The functors R′

KO induce RKU and RKO after passing to the derived categories.
(Strictly speaking this construction of RKO formally diﬀers from the one we were using before,
since in the original construction we do not restrict to those diagrams Y for which π∗(Yζi ) and
π∗(Yβi ), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, are projective π∗KO(p)-modules. However, this does not make any diﬀerence
and the resulting functors between derived categories are the same. The reason is that the essential
image of Q in both cases contains all coﬁbrant diﬀerential graded π∗KO(p)-modules. Hence the
localization of the essential image of Q gives the full derived category D(π∗KO(p)) in both cases.)
In order to be able to compare RKU and RKO, we have to slightly modify the construction of
RKO and replace it by an isomorphic functor whose construction will use the diagram C2 rather
than C4.

The homotopy ring π∗KO(p) is concentrated in degrees divisible by 4.

In particular, it is
concentrated in degrees divisible by 2. We can apply the construction of Subsection 2.4 to KO(p)
by taking only into account that the ring π∗KO(p) is 2-sparse. This gives us a composite

π∗(Zβ0 ) and π∗(Zβ1) are projective. After passing to the derived category the functor R′′

By deﬁnition, we have Q ∼= Q ◦ F and Hocolim ◦F ∼= Hocolim. Now by ﬁrst forming a mate of

We remind the reader that the inverses Q−1 are chosen so that (Q−1, Q) are adjoint equivalences
with Q−1 being the left adjoint. Since both natural transformations involved in the latter pasting
are natural isomorphisms, one obtains the desired natural isomorphism R(2)
∼= RKO. Hence in

ι∗

D(π∗KO(p))

KO

/ D(KO(p))

commutes up to a natural isomorphism.

The ring homomorphism ι : π∗KO(p) → π∗KU(p) makes π∗KU(p) into a free graded π∗KO(p)-
module. This implies that the functor ι∗ : Mod-π∗KU(p) → Mod-π∗KO(p) sends the underlying
projective diﬀerential graded modules to the underlying projective ones. Since the essential images
Q(K(2)
KO) ⊂ Mod-π∗KO(p) and Q(KKU ) ⊂ Mod-π∗KU(p) consist exactly from these kind of
diﬀerential graded modules (see [27, 3.3]), we see that the functor ι∗ restricts to a functor

ι∗ : Q(KKU ) → Q(K(2)

KO).

Now let θ : ι∗Q ∼= Qι∗ denote the obvious natural isomorphism which can be constructed directly
using the deﬁnitions. Further, κ : Hocolim ι∗ ∼= ι∗ Hocolim stands for the canonical natural iso-
morphism coming from the fact that the functor ι∗ : D(KU(p)) → D(KO(p)) preserves homotopy
colimits. The pasting

Next, we would like to see that the natural isomorphism described in Proposition 5.2.3 is
compatible in an appropriate sense with the suspension isomorphisms. Recall again that by
Theorem 4.2.3, the equivalence

RKO : D(π∗KO(p)) → D(KO(p))

together with the natural isomorphism a : RKO ◦ [1] ∼= Σ ◦ RKO is a triangulated equivalence. By
conjugating with the natural isomorphism R(2)

described at the beginning of Subsection 5.2. Theorem 5.2.1 implies that there exists an invertible
(p) such that uξKO = a(2). Deﬁne s : RKU ◦ [1] ∼= Σ ◦ RKU to be the natural
number u ∈ Z×
isomorphism uξKU . Finally, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this paper.

Theorem 5.2.4. Let p be an odd prime. The functor

R = RKU : D(π∗KU(p)) → D(KU(p))

together with the natural isomorphism s : RKU ◦ [1] ∼= Σ ◦ RKU is a triangulated equivalence.

Proof. We already know from Subsection 2.4 that the functor RKU is an equivalence of categories
[27, Corollary 5.2.1]. Using that the functor R(2)
KO together with a(2) is a triangulated equivalence
and Corollary 5.1.2, one sees that it suﬃces to check that the diagram of natural isomorphisms

Proposition 5.2.3. Since the identities s = uξKU and a(2) = uξKO hold, checking commutativity
of the latter diagram amounts to checking that the diagram

and the isomorphism R(2)

KOι∗ ∼= ι∗RKU . More precisely, having the identities

and

in mind, we can check that θ ⊙ ξ′
