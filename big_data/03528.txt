Abstract

Integrable perturbations of the Heisenberg system or nonholonomic integrator are dis-
cussed in the framework of the standard St¨ackel theory. We study relations between the
Bertrand-Darboux equation, well studied in the Hamiltonian case, with its non Hamilto-
nian counterpart and apply the results to construction of the compatible Poisson brackets,
Lax matrices and classical r-matrices in the nonholonomic case.

1 Introduction

It is hard to overemphasize the relevance of conservation laws to the development of physics
and mathematics. Indeed, the existence conserved quantities are of fundamental impor-
tance in the integration of equations of motion and diﬀerential equations in general, es-
pecially when these equations are non-linear. For the Hamiltonian systems we have an
enormous wealth of various constructions of conservation laws. Particularly, we can apply
polynomial Killing tensor ﬁelds to construction of the conserved quantities [2, 12, 26].

The presence of constraints may drastically modify or even destroy any of these con-
structions [1, 7, 9, 10, 13]. Integrable (holonomic) constraints give rise to monogenic reac-
tion forces and non integrable (nonholonomic) constraints give rise to polygenic reaction
forces. We can consider constraints of the ﬁrst order in velocities as integrals of motion
and restrict the vector ﬁeld to their common level surface. Thus, ﬁrst order constraints
induce a reduction of degrees of freedom and it is straightforward to include their eﬀect
and write the problem as an unconstrained lower dimensional system.

If we start with a Hamiltonian system on the Riemannian manifold, then after the re-
duction procedure we obtain some dynamical system on the low dimensional submanifold.
This embedded submanifold inherits metric and Killing tensors from the initial Rieman-
nian manifold. The main aim of this paper is to compare constructions of the conserved
quantities via Killing tensors associated with integrable and nonintegrable constraints with
an example of the generalized Heisenberg system.

The Heisenberg system or nonholonomic integrator has played an important role in
both nonlinear control and nonholonomic dynamics. The original Brockett nonholonomic
integrator has been pointed out as a benchmark example of nonholonomic system with
a ﬁrst-order non integrable constraint, which mimics the kinematic model of a wheeled
mobile robot of the unicycle type [16] and displays all the basic properties of ﬁrst or-
der nonholonomic systems [10]. The nonholonomic integrator and its multidimensional
generalizations may be associated with the Heisenberg algebra, and this fact justiﬁes the
Heisenberg system name with no other explicit relation to quantum mechanics [7].

This paper is organized as follows. The ﬁrst Section recalls a brief description of the
constrained motion in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Section 2 contains the main
result of reduced motion of the generalized nonholonomic integrator on the plane. We
will show that integrable potentials for this non Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld satisfy to the
Bertarnd-Darboux type equation. Solutions of this equation and the corresponding char-
acteristic coordinates will be explicitly determined. Section 3 deals with an application of

1

the standard St¨ackel theory to the non Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. We will discuss a con-
struction of the St¨ackel matrices, compatible Poisson structures, Lax matrices and classical
r-matrices. The paper ends with a list of remarks regarding further applications of the
standard Hamiltonian machinery to nonholonomic systems.

1.1 Main deﬁnitions

In his pioneering paper [5], Brockett introduced the system

˙q1 = v1 ,

˙q2 = v2 ,

˙q3 = q2v1 − q1v2 ,

(1.1)

with q = (q1, q2, q3) the state of the system and v1,2 the inputs. This system, quoted in
the literature as a nonholonomic integrator system or Heisenberg system belongs to the
general class of driftless systems where the dimension of the control vector is smaller than
that of the state vector. The problem of stabilizing this class of system is a nontrivial task
since the linearized part is not controllable [6]. The relations of the underlying geometry
with the sub-Riemannian geometry are discussed in [15].

It is easy to see that, under transformation of coordinates, system (1.1) can be trans-

formed into the ﬁrst-order chained form or the Goursat normal form

˙q1 = v1 ,
˙q2 = v2 ,
˙q3 = q2v1 ,

or

˙q1 = v1 ,
˙q2 = v2 ,
˙q3 = q1v2 .

Such canonical forms are more suitable to deal with the generalizations, for instance with
the second-order nonholonomic constraints with the drift-terms [18].

Other possible generalisation appears when we consider a dynamical model instead of
a pure kinematic model [7, 19]. In order to describe this generalization, let us take the
standard Hamiltonian equations of motion in Euclidean space R3

˙qi =

∂H
∂pi

,

˙pi = −

∂H
∂qi

,

i = 1, 2, 3,

where

H =

1
2

(p2

1 + p2

2 + p2

3) + V (q1, q2, q3).

(1.2)

(1.3)

On the phase space M = T ∗R3 we can introduce coordinates x = (q, p) in which equations
(1.2) have form ˙xi = Xi and to determine Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld

X =

Xi

∂
∂xi

.

2n

Xi=1

which is a linear operator on a space of the smooth functions on M that encodes the
evolution of any quantity

˙F = X(F ) =

Xi

∂F
∂xi

.

2n

Xi=1

Let us impose the constraint of ﬁrst order in momenta (velocities)

f = (b, p) = 0

(1.4)

where b = (b1, b2, b3) is a vector depending on coordinates q and (x, y) means an inner
product in R3.

In this case equations of motion are written in the following form

˙qi =

∂H
∂pi

,

˙pi = −

∂H
∂qi

+ λbi ,

i = 1, 2, 3,

(1.5)

together with the constraint equation (1.4) [7]. The corresponding vector ﬁeld looks like
an additive perturbation of the initial Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld

ˆX = X|f =0 + λ(cid:18)b1

∂
∂p1

+ b2

∂
∂p2

+ b3

∂

∂p3(cid:19) ,

where unknown Lagrange multiplier λ has to be computed from e condition

It is easy to see, that

˙f = ˆX(f ) = X(f )|f =0 + λ(b, b) = 0 .

λ =

X(f )|f =0

(b, b)

.

(1.6)

The Lagrangian λ-term in (1.5) has a remarkable property of giving us the force of reaction
connected with a given constraint. A holonomic constraint is maintained by monogenic
forces, whereas a nonholonomic constrain by polygenic forces.

In holonomic case in the absence of forces there are no reaction forces as well.

In
generic case at V = 0 the Lagrange multiplier (1.6) is also equal to zero for two special
linear constraints only.

Proposition 1 At V = 0 the Lagrange multiplier (1.6) is equal to zero if

f =

3

Xi=1

αipi +

3

Xk=1

βkMk ,

M = x × p ,

αi, βi ∈ R ,

(1.7)

where M is an angular momentum vector. Another solution of the equation λ = 0 has the
following form

α, β ∈ R
up to permutation of indices. Here z is a solution of equation

f = zp1 + αp2 + βp3 ,

(1.8)

F (z) + zq1 + αq2 + βq3 = 0

and F (z) is an arbitrary function.

In order to prove this proposition we can put b3 = 1 in (1.4) without loss of generality. In
this case equation λ = 0 yields a system of partial diﬀerential equations

b1∂3b1 = ∂1b1 ,

b2∂3b2 = ∂2b2 ,

b2∂3b1 + b1∂3b2 = ∂1b2 + ∂2b1 ,

where ∂j = ∂/∂qj . Solving these equations with respect to b1,2 one gets two solutions (1.7)
and (1.8). For instance, if F (z) = z2 in (1.8) we have the following constraint

f =  q1

2

+ pq2

1 + 4αq2 + 4βq3

2

! p1 + αp2 + pβp3

which physical meaning is nothing but the necessary condition to regain zero Lagrange
multiplier λ = 0 at V = 0.

Below we will consider integrable constraint

f = p3 = 0 ,

b = (0, 0, 1),

(1.9)

when a third component of momenta is equal to zero, and non integrable constraint

f = p3 − (q2p1 − q1p2) = 0 ,

b = (−q2, q1, 1) ,

(1.10)

when third components of momenta and angular momenta coincide with each other. Both
these constraints are partial cases of (1.7).

At V = 0 the corresponding vector ﬁelds ˆX read as

˙q1 = p1 ,
˙q2 = p2 ,
˙q3 = 0 ,

and

˙q1 = p1 ,
˙q2 = p2 ,
˙q3 = q2p1 − q1p2 .

Thus, imposing the holonomic constraint (1.9) one gets free motion on the plane, whereas
imposing the nonholonomic constraint (1.10) we reproduce Brockett’s equations (1.1) for
the nonholonomic integrator. In both cases the equation for q3 decouples from the rest
of the system. Once the reduced two-dimensional system has been integrated, the third
component can be computed from the constraint.

3

If q3 is a cyclic coordinate, then Lagrange multipliers (1.6) are equal to

λ = 0

and

λ =

q1∂2V − q2∂1V
1 + q2
2

1 + q2

,

∂j =

∂
∂qj

,

respectively. Thus, the Hamiltonian system (1.3) with integrable constraint (1.9) represent
a Hamiltonian system on the plane R2 embedded in a three dimensional Euclidean space
R3 in which there is no force acting on the third component. If we impose non integrable
constraint (1.10), the equations for q3 also decouples from the rest of the system (1.5) and
we obtain a two-degrees of freedom non-Hamiltonian system on the plane [7, 19].

Integrability of the Hamiltonian systems on the plane is the well-known problem of
classical mechanics considered by Bertrand [3] and Darboux [11]. Later on results of this
investigation due to Darboux were included in the textbook of Whittaker on analytical me-
chanics [29] almost verbatim. In the next Section we compare classical Bertrand-Darboux
theorem with its non-Hamiltonian counterpart, which appears in the nonholonomic case.

2 Reduced systems on the plane

At V = V (q1, q2) substituting integrable constraint p3 = 0 (1.9) into (1.3) one gets

H1 =

1 + p2

1

2(cid:0)p2

2(cid:1) + V (q1, q2) =

1
2

gij pipj + V (q1, q2) ,

g =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1 (cid:19) .

(2.11)

with the summation convention in force; we regard the gij as components of the covariant
form of the metric tensor g on the plane, and use this metric freely to raise and lower
indices.

After standard Hamiltonian reduction by cyclic third coordinate, the original Hamilto-

nian vector ﬁeld (1.2) in T ∗R3 becomes the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld in T ∗R2

˙x = X ,

X = P dH1 ,

P =(cid:18) 0
−I

I

0 (cid:19) ,

(2.12)

where x = (q1, q2, p1, p2). The Poisson bivector P in (2.12) deﬁnes canonical Poisson
bracket

{qi, pi} = 1 ,

{qi, pk} = {p1, p2} = 0 ,

i 6= k .

(2.13)

Of course, this vector ﬁeld X preserves Poisson structure P , energy H1 and the standard
volume 2-form Ω = dq ∧ dp.

Substituting non integrable constraint p3 = q2p1 − q1p2 (1.10) into (1.3) one gets

ˆH1 =

2(cid:0)p2

2 −q1q2
1 + q2

(2.14)

The second order contravariant symmetric tensor ﬁeld ˆg is a Killing tensor with respect to
the standard metric tensor g, i.e. it satisﬁes to the Killing equation

where [[., .]] is a Schouten bracket. It allows us to construct conformal Killing tensor of
second order with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion

[[g, ˆg]] = 0,

G = ˆg − tr (ˆg) g = −(cid:18) 1 + q2

and to deﬁne the standard Turiel deformation of the standard symplectic form

see [23] and references within. The corresponding Poisson bracket

ˆω = d(cid:16)Gij pidqj(cid:17) ,

{qi, pi}∧ = 1 + q2
i ,

{qi, pj}∧ = q1q2 ,

{p1, p2}∧ = q1p2 − q2p1 ,

i 6= j

(2.15)

is compatible with canonical bracket (2.13). Because the Turiel deformation is trivial, there
is a change of variables

p1 → π1 =

q1q2p2 − (1 + q2

,

p2 → π2 =

q1q2p1 − (1 + q2

1 )p2

,

(2.16)

which transforms this bracket to the canonical one (2.13), similar to other nonholonomic
systems with constraints of ﬁrst order in momenta [4, 8, 24].

After the nonholonomic reduction, original Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld (1.2) in T ∗R3 be-

comes a conformally Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld in T ∗R2

˙x = ˆX,

ˆX = µ ˆP d ˆH1 ,

ˆP = ˆω−1 ,

(2.17)

where conformal factor

µ = (1 + q2

1 + q2

2)−1

is a nowhere vanishing smooth function on an open dense subset of the plane q1,2 6= ∞.
This vector ﬁeld possesses energy ˆH1 and the volume 2-form ˆΩ = µdq ∧ dp, but it does not
preserve the Poisson bivector ˆP .

2.1 Bertrand-Darboux type equation

In holonomic case existence of the integrals of second order in velocities is described by a
classical Bertrand-Darboux theorem [3, 11, 29].

Proposition 2 The function (2.11)

H1 =

1
2

gij pipj + V (q1, q2) ,

g =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1 (cid:19)

(2.18)

deﬁnes integrable Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld X (2.12), which has an independent quadratic
ﬁrst integral

H2 = K ij pipj + U (q1, q2) ,

(2.19)

if the second order contravariant symmetric tensor ﬁeld K obeys the Killing tensor equation

and potential V satisﬁes the compatibility condition

d(KdV ) = 0 ,

K = K g−1 ,

[[g, K]] = 0,

(2.20)

(2.21)

where K is a tensor ﬁeld of (1,1) type.

A characteristic coordinate system for (2.21) provides separation for the potential V
and can be taken as one of the following four orthogonal coordinate systems on the plane:
elliptic, parabolic, polar or Cartesian.

The modern proof of this classic statement may be found in [20].

In nonholonomic case we can also substitute the same ansatz (2.19) into the equation

˙H2 = 0 and get the following generalisation of the Bertrand-Darboux result.
Proposition 3 The function (2.14)

ˆH1 =

1
2

ˆgij pipj + V (q1, q2) ,

ˆg =(cid:18) 1 + q2
−q1q2

1 (cid:19)
2 −q1q2
1 + q2

(2.22)

deﬁnes integrable conformally Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld ˆX (2.17), which has an independent
quadratic ﬁrst integral

ˆH2 = K ij pipj + U (q1, q2) ,

if the second order contravariant symmetric tensor ﬁeld K is a Killing tensor

[[g, K]] = 0 ,

g =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1 (cid:19)

and potential V satisﬁes the compatibility condition

d( ˆKdV ) = 0 ,

ˆK = K ˆg−1 .

A characteristic coordinate system for (2.25) provides separation for potential V (q1, q2).

5

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

In this case existence of the second integral of motion guarantees integrability of the given
non Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld ˆX according to the Euler-Jacoby theorem [17]. Equation
(2.25) was brieﬂy discussed in [28] using coordinates q1,2 and momenta π1,2 (2.16).

In contrast with the standard Bertrand-Darboux theorem the Killing equation (2.24)
and compatibility condition (2.25) include two diﬀerent metrics g and ˆg. It happens because
the reaction force is entered in the second part of the vector ﬁeld (1.5) only. Sequentially,
K is a Killing tensor with respect to the Euclidean metric g to the plane, which is an
induced metric associated with standard embedding R2 ⊂ R3 in Cartesian coordinates.
However, K is not a Killing tensor with respect to metric ˆg, which appears in the reduced
Hamiltonian (2.14) after nonholonomic reduction and then deﬁnes raising and lowering
indices in the compatibility condition (2.25).

2.2 Solutions of the Bertrand-Darboux type equation

In [11] Darboux proceeds to ﬁnd the unknown potential V (q1, q2) by solving the compat-
ibility condition (2.21) using method of characteristics. Solving the second compatibility
condition (2.25) we can apply the same method.

In both cases characteristic coordinates for (2.21) and (2.25) consist of eigenvalues of
the corresponding (1,1) tensor ﬁeld K or ˆK. In order to describe these coordinates we can
start with a well-known generic solution of the common Killing tensor equation (2.20) and
(2.24)

K =(cid:18)

c1q2

2 + 2c2q2 + c3

−c1q1q2 − c2q1 − c4q2 + c6

−c1q1q2 − c2q1 − c4q2 + c6

1 + 2c4q1 + c5

c1q2

(cid:19)

(2.26)

which depends on six constants of integration c1, . . . , c6.

Substituting this generic solution into the standard compatibility condition (2.21) one

gets

(cid:16)A∂11 + B∂22 + C∂12 + a∂1 + b∂2(cid:17)V (q1, q2) = 0 ,

where ∂i = ∂/∂qi, ∂ik = ∂2/∂qi∂qk and polynomials of second order read as
A = c1q1q2 + c2q1 + c4q2 − c6 , B = −A , C = c1q2
whereas polynomials of the ﬁrst order are

2 − c1q2

1 + 2c2q2 − 2c4q1 + c3 − c5

(2.27)

a = 3(c1q2 + c2) ,

b = −3(c1q1 + c4) .

The linear PDE (2.27) of second order was obtained by Bertrand [3] and studied by Dar-
boux [11]. Thus, it was later called the Bertrand-Darboux equation [20, 29] .

Solving (2.27) for V (q1, q2) amounts to ﬁnding admissible potentials of the Hamiltonian
systems deﬁned by H (2.11), which integrability is aﬀorded by the existence of ﬁrst integrals
(2.19) which are quadratic in the momenta. Second potential U (q1, q2) in (2.19) is a solution
of the equation

d(KdU ) = V .

In nonholonomic case, substituting the same generic solution (2.26) into the compati-

bility condition (2.25) one gets similar linear PDE

Solutions V (q1q2) of this Bertrand-Darboux type equation (2.28) determine all the admis-
sible Jacobi integrals (2.14), which deﬁne integrable confomally Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds
(2.17) with ﬁrst integrals (2.23) of second order in momenta. In this case potential U (q1, q2)
in (2.23) is a solution of the equation

d( ˆKdU ) = V .

Before solving the PDE (2.27), Darboux ingeniously observes that it can be simpliﬁed
without loss of generality [11].
Indeed, by rotating and translating the axes, one can
simplify the general solution of the Killing tensor equation, thus bringing it to a certain
canonical form. In modern language solving the equivalence and canonical forms problem
for the Killing tensor equation (2.20,2.24) is equivalent to analysing the orbits of the
six-dimensional vector space of solutions under the action of the Lie group of orientation-
preserving isometries. It is well known that there are four types of orbits generated by the
following canonical Killing tensors

respectively. Let us consider these characteristic coordinate systems associated with the

the characteristic tensor ˆK = K (4)ˆg−1, one gets the following eigenvalues

Solutions of the compatibility equations (2.21) and (2.25) are labelled by two arbitrary
functions F1 and F2 on these coordinates :

or u1,2 = ˆξ1,2 .

V (q1, q2) =

Parabolic coordinates:
In holonomic case eigenvalues of the characteristic tensor K = K (3)g−1 are standard
parabolic coordinates

ζ1,2 = q1 ±qq2

(2.30)

whereas in nonholonomic case eigenvalues of the characteristic tensor ˆK = K (3)ˆg−1 read
as

Polar coordinates:
Using one nontrivial eigenvalue of characteristic tensors K = K (2)g−1 and ˆK = K (2)ˆg−1
we can introduce only one coordinate

(2.32)

The second coordinate is a function on q1/q2, for instance, it could be an angle ϕ =
arctan q1/q2, because solutions of the compatibility equations (2.21) and (2.25) have the
following form

V (q1, q2) = F1(ρ) +

F2(ϕ)

ρ = r

or ρ = ˆr .

Cartesian coordinates:
Separable in the Cartesian coordinates solution of the compatibility condition (2.21) reads
as

V (q1, q2) = F1(q1) + F2(q2) .

In nonholonomic case characteristic tensor ˆK = K (1)ˆg−1 yields only one coordinate

and the separable solution of the compatibility condition (2.25) looks like

V (q1, q2) = F1(ˆ̺) +

F2( ˆφ)

ˆ̺2

,

ˆφ = arctan q1 .

Thus, after nonholonomic reduction one gets separable potential, which is diﬀerent, even
in the form of standard potential (2.33) separable in Cartesian coordinates.

Summing up, we have found four characteristic coordinate systems for the Bertrand-
Darboux type equation (2.28) associated with the integrable non-Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
ˆX (2.17). Additional ﬁrst integral of this ﬁeld ˆX is a polynomial of the second order
in momenta deﬁned by the standard Killing tensor on the plane. Consequently, we can
directly apply the standard St¨ackel theory to the generalized nonholonomic integrator.

3 St¨ackel systems

In holonomic case there is a one-to-one correspondence between the so-called St¨ackel sys-
tems, integrable Killing tensors which mutually commute in the algebraic sense and sepa-
ration of variables [2, 21, 22].

(3.34)

which are in involution with respect to canonical Poisson brackets

{ui, puj} = δij ,

{ui, uj} = {pui , puj} = 0 .

The common level surface of the ﬁrst integrals H1 = α1 , . . . H2 = αn is diﬀeomorphic to
the n-dimensional real torus and one immediately gets

k = 1, . . . , n ,

(3.35)

where β1 = t and β2, . . . , βn are constants of integration. Solution of the problem is thus
reduced to solving a sequence of one-dimensional problems, which is the essence of the
method of separation of variables [2, 21, 22].

3.1 St¨ackel matrices for reduced systems

In the deﬁnition of the St¨ackel integrals of motion (3.34) momenta pu have to be canoni-
cally conjugated to eigenvalues u of the characteristic (1,1) tensor K. For instance, if we
take tensor K (3) (2.29) the eigenvalues of K are parabolic coordinates ζ1,2 (2.30) and the
corresponding momenta read as

pζ1,2 =

p1

2 ± pq2

1 + q2
2q2

2 ∓ q1

p2 .

In nonholonomic case the eigenvalues of ˆK are given by ˆζ1,2 (2.31) and the conjugated
momenta have the following form

p ˆζ1,2 =

In similar manner we can calculate all the canonical variables associated with tensors K (j)
(2.29) and to obtain standard St¨ackel matrices in holonomic case

S(1) =(cid:18) 1

matrices are equal to

ˆS(1) =



It is easy to see, that imposing linear, non integrable constraint (1.10) in polar, parabolic
and elliptic cases we have to multiply j column of the standard St¨ackel matrices on the
function (1 − uj ), where uj is the eigenvalue of ˆK. Similar transformations of the St¨ackel
matrices for nonholomic systems on a two-dimensional sphere are discussed in [25].

Using a new time variable τ deﬁned by

dt = µ−1dτ ≡ (1 + q2

1 + q2

2 )dτ

we can rewrite the conformally Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld ˆX (2.17) in the Hamiltonian form
and obtain quadratures (3.35).

Thus, in nonholonomic case solution of the problem is reduced to solving a sequence of

one-dimensional problems after suitable change of time.

3.2 Compatible Poisson brackets

Riemannian geometry is not, a priory, concerned with symplectic or Poisson structures.
Nevertheless, it is known that any tensor ﬁeld L with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion on the
Riemannian manifold Q yields trivial deformation of the canonical Poisson bracket {., .}
on its cotangent bundle T ∗Q.

{qi, qj}L = 0 ,

{qi, pj}L = −Lij ,

{pi, pj}L =(cid:18) ∂Lkj
∂qi −

∂Lki

∂qj (cid:19) pk ,

(3.36)

where (pi, qi) are ﬁbered coordinates. This Poisson bracket is compatible with the canonical
one, so that there is a recursion operator N = PLP −1, which allows us to construct a
whole family of compatible brackets associated with Poisson bivectors P (m)
L = N mP on
T ∗Q [23, 25].

According to [2] generic solution of the Killing equation K (2.26) determines a conformal

Killing tensor with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion

L = K − tr(K) g

(3.37)

and Turiel’s deformation (3.36) of the canonical Poisson bracket [25, 26]. The eigenvalues of
the corresponding recursion operator N = PLP −1 are characteristic coordinates. Integrals
of motion H1 (2.18) and H2 (2.19) are in involution with respect to the compatible Poisson
brackets

{H1, H2} = {H1, H2}L = 0

and to other polynomial Poisson brackets associated with the Poisson bivectors P (m)
L .
Indeed, we can ﬁnd such L-tensors directly from the Hamilton function H1 using modern
software [14].

For the generalized nonholonomic integrator, we have to solve the same Killing equation
(2.24) and second equation on potential with (1,1) tensor ˆK = Kˆg. This tensor does not
appear in the Turiel construction of the Poisson bracket and we can directly prove the
following Proposition.
Proposition 4 Integrals of motion ˆH1 (2.22) and ˆH2 (2.23) are in involution

{ ˆH1, ˆH2}∧ = { ˆH1, ˆH2}L = 0

with respect to the compatible Poisson brackets {., .}∧ (2.15 ) and {., .}L (3.36). The
eigenvalues of the recursion operator

ˆN = PL ˆP −1

where ˆP is given by (2.17), are characteristic coordinates discussed in the previous Section.
The proof consists of the straightforward calculations.

Thus, starting with a common Poisson bivector PL we can construct two recursion

operators N and ˆN and two families of the Poisson brackets on T ∗R2.

3.3 Lax matrices

Following to [21, 22] we can construct Lax representations for the St¨ackel systems with
uniform rational and polynomial potentials Uj = U in (3.34). For the sake of brevity we
consider only systems associated with tensor K (3) (2.29).

If V (q1, q2) = 0, we can introduce a well-known 2 × 2 Lax matrix for the geodesic

motion on the plane

L(u) =(cid:18) h

f −h (cid:19) (u) ≡

e

which satisﬁes to the Lax equation

(3.38)

(3.39)

This equation guarantees that the eigenvalues of L are conserved quantities.
In our case function e(u) depends on the so-called spectral parameter u

e(u) =

(u − ζ1)(u − ζ2)

u

= u − 2q1 −

q2
2
u

,

which is completely deﬁned by the eigenvalues of the characteristic tensor K = K (3)g−1
[21] or parabolic coordinates ζ1,2 on the plane.

The involution property of eigenvalues of the Lax matrix L is equivalent to existence

of a classical r-matrix r12, that as

{L1(u), L2(v)} = [r12(u, v),L1(u)] − [r21(u, v),L2(v)] .

(3.40)

Here we use the familiar notation for tensor product of L and unit matrix I

L1(u) = L(u) ⊗ I ,

L2(v) = I ⊗ L(v),

r21(u, v) = Πr12(v, u)Π ,

whereas Π is the permutation operator: Πx ⊗ y = y ⊗ x, ∀x, y. Evaluating canonical
Poisson brackets (2.13) between entries of the Lax matrix L(u) (3.38) we obtain a constant
r-matrix

r12(u, v) =

(3.41)

If we want to consider separable in parabolic coordinates potentials V (q1, q2), we have
to add some items to the initial Lax matrix L(u) (3.38). For instance, we can take the
following additive perturbation

LV (u) = L(u) +(cid:18) 0

∆f

0

0 (cid:19) ,

∆f =(cid:2)φ(u)e−1(u)(cid:3) ,

where φ(u) is an arbitrary constant function and [g(u)] is a truncated Laurent series ex-
pansion of g(u) with respect to the variable u [21, 22]. For instance, at φ(u) = −au3 the
Taylor part of expansion about u = ∞ looks like

[−au3 e−1(u)] = −a(u2 + 2uq1 + q2

2 + 4q2

1 ) .

Substituting this expression into LV (u) one gets a Lax matrix for the H´enon- Heiles system
on the plane with the Hamiltonian

H1 =

1
2

(p2

1 + p2

2) + 8aq1(2q2

1 + q2

2 ) .

The corresponding Lax matrix also contains information about auto and hetero B¨acklund
transformations of the H´enon-Heiles system, about its discrete counterparts and about
another case of H´enon-Heiles systems with ﬁrst integrals of fourth order in momenta [27].
In nonholonomic case we can also ﬁnd similar Lax matrices, classical r-matrix and

integrable potentials.

Proposition 5 For the nonholonomic integrator equations of motion (2.17) at V (q1, q2) =
0 can be rewritten in the Lax form (3.39) if

ˆL(u) =(cid:18) ˆh

The Lax matrix (3.42) was constructed by using the generic construction of the Lax ma-
trices for the St¨ackel systems [21, 22]. The modiﬁcation consists only of application of the
nontrivial conformal factor µ.

Evaluating Poisson brackets {., .}∧ (2.15) between entries of the Lax matrix ˆL(u) (3.42)

we ﬁnd the corresponding classical r-matrix

ˆr12(u, v) = r12(u, v) + 2

(3.43)

which explicitly depends on dynamical variables via entries of ˆL(u) (3.42).

As above, we can consider additive perturbation of this Lax matrix

ˆLV (u) = ˆL(u) +(cid:18) 0

∆ ˆf = (u2 − 1)(cid:2)φ(u)ˆe−1(u)(cid:3)
in order to get Lax matrices for the generalized nonholonomic integrator with V 6= 0. For
instance, at φ(u) = −au3 the Teylor part of expansion about u = ∞ looks like
2)2(cid:19) .

Substituting this expression into ˆLV (u) one gets a Lax matrix for the nonholonomic coun-
terpart of the H´enon-Hieles system on the plane with the Jacoby integral

Following to [6] we can study stabilization of the corresponding nonholonomic system using
isospectral ﬂow of the Lax matrix.

This Lax matrix also contains information about B¨acklund transformations, i.e. canon-
ical transformations preserving the form of integrals of motion ˆH1,2 (2.22-2.23). We can
use such transformations either to determine discrete analog of the nonholonomic integra-
tor, or to construct a conformally Hamiltonian system with ﬁrst integral of fourth order in
momenta, similar to usual H´enon-Hieles system [27].

4 Conclusion

The original Brockett nonholonomic integrator is a kinematic model of a wheeled mobile
robot of the unicycle type. In this paper we discuss generalized nonholonomic integrator
by adding external potential forces to the Brockett system. After nonholonomic reduction
the resulting dynamical system is given by conformally Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld.

We ﬁnd Killing tensors and compatible Poisson brackets associated with this non-Ha-
miltonian system, describe integrable potentials and characteristic coordinates, evaluate
St¨ackel matrices and St¨ackel quadratures, to show Lax matrices and classical r-matrices
etc. Indeed, we prove that a lot of the standard geometric methods of mechanics could be
applied both to Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian systems. Other similar examples can
be found in [4, 9, 24, 25].
