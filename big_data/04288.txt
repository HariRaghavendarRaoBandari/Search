We prove the equivalence between two approaches to the characterisation of quantum Markovianity, divisi-
bility and lack of information backﬂow. We show that a dynamical map is completely-positive-divisible if and
only if a monotonic non-increase of distinguishability is observed for two equiprobable states of the evolving
system and an ancilla. Moreover our proof is constructive for invertible dynamical maps: given any such a map
that is not completely-positive-divisible, we give an explicit construction of two states that exhibit information
backﬂow. Finally, while an ancilla is necessary for the equivalence to hold in general, we show that it is always
possible to witness the non-Markovianity of maps without using any entanglement between system and ancilla.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of open quantum systems [1–3] has attracted
a lot of attention in recent years. In particular the phenomenon
of reservoir memory eﬀects and the problem of classify-
ing memoryless dynamics, the so-called Markovian regime,
and dynamics exhibiting memory eﬀects, the non-Markovian
regime, have been investigated extensively (for extended re-
views see [4, 5]). However, to date a unique concept of quan-
tum Markovianity does not exist. One can distinguish two
main ideas, completely-positive-divisibility, CP-divisability in
what follows, and information ﬂow.

The ﬁrst idea is based on an analogy with the deﬁnition
of classical Markovian processes. It provides a mathematical
characterisation of a map describing a memoryless evolution
as a composition of physical maps. This property is known as
CP-divisibility and generalises the semigroup property [6, 7].
Based on this idea a measure of non-Markovianity has been
proposed [8], which assesses the deviation of an evolution
from being CP-divisible.

The second idea is more operational and based on the phys-
ical features of the system-reservoir interaction, namely, that
the phenomenon of reservoir memory eﬀects may be associ-
ated with an information backﬂow. This observation led to
the development of a measure of non-Markovianity that quan-
tiﬁes the amount of information that ﬂows back from the en-
vironment to the system in terms of the distinguishability of
states [9]. Following this idea, diﬀerent measures of infor-
mation backﬂow were considered, based for instance on the
quantum Fisher information ﬂow [10], the ﬁdelity [11], the
mutual information [12], channel capacities [13], the geom-
etry of the set of accessible states [14], and the channel dis-
tinguishability [15]. One can now associate diﬀerent deﬁni-
tions of Markovianity with each of these measures respec-
tively. CP-divisibility implies Markovianity by all the above
listed deﬁnitions, but the converse is not true for all dynamics
[16–18]. Moreover, it is known that in general the diﬀerent
deﬁnitions do not coincide in the detection of the Markovian
regime of the dynamics, which makes the concept of quantum
Markovianity even more elusive.

One way of addressing this issue is to assume that reservoir
memory eﬀects are a complex phenomenon and a number of

measures describing diﬀerent properties of the open quantum
systems are necessary for its full characterisation [19]. On
the other hand it raises the essential question of existence of
a generalised deﬁnition of information ﬂow that would pro-
vide a deﬁnition of Markovian dynamics equivalent with the
mathematical characterisation through CP-divisibility. Some
attempts in this direction have been done in Ref. [17]. Re-
cently a measure of information ﬂow in direct correspondence
with the CP-divisibility property was given in Ref. [20]. How-
ever a drawback of this measure is the diﬃculty in its applica-
tion, as it is not constructive.

In this work we prove that CP-divisibility and informa-
tion ﬂow are equivalent: for any dynamical map that is not
CP-divisible, it is possible to identify two quantum states,
taken with equal prior probability, whose distinguishability
increases during the evolution. This direct link is enabled by
considering distinguishability of states on an extended Hilbert
space consisting of the system of interest of dimension d and
an additional ancilla of dimension d +1. For bijective dynami-
cal maps, which is the case for most physically relevant maps,
the result is constructive, i.e., for a given dynamical map that
is not CP-divisible we show how to derive states displaying
an increase of distinguishability during the evolution. Finally,
despite the fact that the presence of an ancilla is necessary
for the equivalence to hold, we show that entanglement is not
needed: information backﬂow can always be observed using
two separable states.

II. MARKOVIAN DYNAMICS - DEFINITIONS

We consider a quantum system S living on a ﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space HS isomorphic to Cd. The set of
bounded linear operators acting on HS is denoted by B(HS ),
of which the set of states on this Hilbert space, S (HS ), is a
subset.

The evolution of the quantum system S from initial time t =
0 to some ﬁxed time t can be described by a dynamical map,
i.e., a linear operator Λt : S (HS ) → S (HS ) that is completely
positive and trace preserving (CPTP). The full dynamics of
an open quantum system is then given by a time-parametrised
family of dynamical maps, Λ = {Λt}, with the initial condition

Λ0 = Id, where Id is an identity map.

Let us now discuss in more detail the main two approaches

to characterise the memoryless dynamics of open systems.

Divisibility. - The ﬁrst approach to Markovianity is based
on an analogy with the classical Chapman-Kolmogorov equal-
ity, which in the classical case is equivalent to the deﬁnition
of Markovianity for one-point probabilities. In quantum dy-
namics it is connected to the notion of divisibility.

Deﬁnition 1. A dynamical map Λt is called divisible if it can
be expressed as a sequence of linear maps

Λt = Vt,sΛs,

(1)

for all times 0 ≤ s ≤ t.

Note that if the dynamical map Λs is invertible, then the
intermediate map Vt,s is well deﬁned and can be written as
ΛtΛ−1
s . This, however, does not imply (complete) positivity
of the map Vt,s, as the inverse of a CP map in general is not
positive. While assuming invertibility is a restriction of the
dynamics, it is satisﬁed for many of the dynamical maps de-
scribing physical evolution in which the equilibrium state is
reached asymptotically rather than in a ﬁnite time. In any case,
our proof of equivalence does not require Λs to be invertible.
In this approach a quantum dynamics is deﬁned as Marko-
vian if and only if it is divisible into a sequence of dynami-
cal maps, namely when the linear map Vt,s in equation (1) is
CPTP. We call such dynamical maps CP-divisible,

Deﬁnition 2. A dynamical map Λt is CP-divisible if and only
if it satisﬁes the decomposition law Λt = Vt,sΛs, where Vt,s is
a completely positive and trace preserving map for all times
0 ≤ s ≤ t.

It is also useful to consider the situation in which the in-
termediate linear map Vt,s in Eq. (1) is trace preserving and
just positive (but not completely positive). Such dynamics is
called P-divisible,

Deﬁnition 3. A dynamical map Λt is P-divisible if and only if
Λt = Vt,sΛs, with Vt,s is positive and trace preserving map for
all times 0 ≤ s ≤ t.

Information ﬂow. - The second approach to deﬁne Marko-
vianity, introduced in Ref. [9], is based on a physical inter-
pretation of memory eﬀects in the open-system dynamics as
an information exchange between the system and its environ-
ment. During a Markovian evolution, information can only
ﬂow from the system to the environment, however in the non-
Markovian case a temporal backﬂow, of information previ-
ously lost, can occur from the environment to the system.

Deﬁnition 4. Information ﬂow between the system, living in
HS , and its environment, during the evolution described by
the dynamical map Λt, is deﬁned as

σ({ρi}, t) :=

d
dt

I({Λt(ρi)}),

(2)

where ρi are states on HS and I(.) is some relevant informa-
tion quantiﬁer.

2

In this approach, an open quantum system dynamics is
called Markovian if and only if the distinguishability of states
is monotonically non-increasing in time. This deﬁnition was
originally proposed in Ref. [9] using as information quantiﬁer
I(.) the trace distance, D(ρ1, ρ2) = 1
2 ||ρ1 − ρ2||1, where ||.||1
stands for the trace norm. This quantiﬁer has a clear oper-
ational meaning, as it gives the minimal error probability of
distinguishing states ρ1 and ρ2 with the same a priori proba-
bility [21]. As mentioned, other variants of this measure have
been considered for other information quantiﬁers.

Previous results.

- Before proving the announced equiv-
alence between CP-divisibility and information ﬂow, we re-
view some previous results that are relevant for what follows.
A detailed discussion of the connection between our work and
these results is given below.

First, note that by probing the distinguishability of quantum
states without an ancilla, as proposed in [9], it is impossible to
distinguish between P- and CP-divisibility. This follows from
the following result

Theorem. [22, 23] Any trace preserving linear map E :
B(H) → B(H) is positive if and only if for any Hermitian
operator ∆ acting on H, ||E(∆)||1 ≤ ||∆||1holds.

Note that, up to normalization, any Hermitian operator can
be interpreted as the so-called Helstrom matrix [21], ∆p =
pρ1 − (1 − p)ρ2, characterising the error probability of dis-
criminating between two states ρ1 or ρ2 with unequal proba-
bilities, p and 1 − p respectively [17]. This extended notion
of distinguishability is more than just a formal reﬁnement, as
it increases the sensitivity of the information ﬂow deﬁnition,
in particular it enables detection of the non-Markovian be-
haviour of the non-unital parts of the dynamical map. Yet, the
previous theorem implies that it does not allow distinguishing
between P- and CP-divisiblity. Thus, any attempt to connect
CP-divisibility and information ﬂow should consider the dis-
tinguishability of states on an extended Hilbert space of sys-
tem and ancilla of at least the same dimension d, Cd ⊗ Cd.

The previous theorem is also relevant in the case in which
the dynamical map is invertible and the intermediate map Vt,s
can be deﬁned [17]. Let’s assume that this map is not CP for
some interval of time [s, t]. Then, the theorem guarantees the
existence of a Helstrom matrix in Cd ⊗ Cd, ∆∗, that witnesses
it, i.e., ||(Id ⊗ Vt,s)(∆∗)||1 > ||∆∗||1. However, this result is not
enough to guarantee an operational information backﬂow in
the dynamics. For that, one would need to show that ∆∗ is of
the form pρ1 −(1− p)ρ2, where ρ1 and ρ2 are states lying in the
image of the previous map, I(Id ⊗ Λs). Whether this is always
possible remains to be proven. In other words, it is conceiv-
able a situation in which the intermediate map Vt,s is not CP,
but no Helstrom operator ∆∗ detecting it can be constructed
from states that are reachable during the evolution. Hence,
no information backﬂow, in terms of state distinguishability,
would be observed.

A second result relevant in the present context was derived
in Ref.[20]. There, a further generalisation of information
backﬂow was deﬁned in terms of the guessing probability of
discriminating an ensemble of states {ρi} acting on Cd ⊗ Cd
with prior probabilities pi. It was shown that an evolution is

CP-divisible if and only if the guessing probability decreases
for any ensemble of states. The applicability of this result
however is unclear, as the result is not constructive and, in
particular, no upper bound on the size of the ensemble wit-
nessing the non-Markovianity was provided.

III. EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN CP-DIVISIBILITY AND

NON-INCREASING DISTINGUISHABILITY

After reviewing all the relevant deﬁnitions and concepts,
we are now in position to present our main results. We
now show that CP-divisibility and monotonic non-increase of
distinguishability for all pairs of states of the system and a
(d + 1)−dimensional ancilla, as measured by the trace dis-
tance, are equivalent. To begin, we prove the equivalence for
the special case when the evolution is divisible.

Lemma 1. A dynamical and divisible map Λt acting on Cd is
CP-divisible if and only if the evolution does not increase the
distinguishability, as measured by the trace distance, between
any two initial states ρ1 and ρ2 on Cd+1 ⊗ Cd with the same
priori probability for any two times s < t; that is ||Id+1 ⊗
Λs(ρ1 − ρ2)||1 ≥ ||Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρ1 − ρ2)||1.

For the proof of Lemma 1 see Appendix VI B. Note that it
implies that for each map Vt,s which is not CP there exist two
states for which distinguishability increases between s and t.
While Lemma 1 is applicable for divisible evolution it does
not prove the equivalence with full generality, as the possibil-
ity remains open that the distinguishability, as measured by
the trace distance, can be monotonically non-increasing for
some non-divisible evolutions. However, it can be shown that
this is not possible.

Lemma 2. If the evolution of the system does not increase the
distinguishability between any two initial states ρ1 and ρ2 for
any two times s < t, as measured by the trace distance; that is
if ||Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρ1 − ρ2)||1 ≥ ||Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρ1 − ρ2)||1, the evolution
is divisible into a sequence of linear maps.

For the proof of Lemma 2 see Appendix VI C. Lemma 2
allows us to remove the assumption that the evolution is divis-
ible in Lemma 1 and then state the announced general result.

Theorem 1. The evolution of the system is CP-divisible if and
only if the distinguishability between any two initial states on
the Hilbert space Cd+1 ⊗ Cd of the d-dimensional system and a
(d+1)-dimensional ancilla, as measured by the trace distance,
is monotonically non-increasing.

Theorem 1 shows that CP-divisibility of the evolution is
equivalent to monotonic non-increase in distinguishability
measured by the trace distance, or error probability, already
for two equiprobable states.

In relation to Theorem 1 we can make an additional obser-
vation: the increase in distinguishability can always be de-
tected without using any entanglement.

Corollary 1. If the evolution is not CP-divisible there exist
two separable initial states ρ1 and ρ2, and two times s < t,

3

such that the distinguishability as measured by the trace dis-
tance increases; that is ||Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρ1 − ρ2)||1 < ||Id+1 ⊗
Λt(ρ1 − ρ2)||1.

This observation follows directly from Theorem 1 and the
methods used in the proof of Lemma 1, as explained in Ap-
pendix VI D.

IV. EXPLICIT CONSTRUCTION FOR BIJECTIVE

DYNAMICAL MAPS

Theorem 1 establishes the existence of initial states for
which the distinguishability increases under a non CP-
divisible evolution, but it does not give an explicit construc-
tion of such states. We now show that if the evolution is de-
scribed by bijective dynamical maps we can, for each time s
and each possible dynamical map Λs, explicitly construct two
initial states such that their distinguishability increases for any
subsequent evolution Vt,s that is not CP. Part of the construc-
tion is inspired by the techniques of Ref. [24]. For this, we
consider two orthogonal subspaces HA and HA′ of the ancilla
Hilbert space Cd+1, isomorphic to Cd and C, respectively. We
then make use of the three following observations.

Secondly, consider the state |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS

First, consider the maximally entangled state φ+ =
Pi, j |biihb j| ⊗ |aiiha j| where |aii is an orthonormal basis of HS
and likewise |bii is an orthonormal basis of HA. The operator
Id ⊗ Vt,s(φ+) is non-negative if and only if Vt,s is CP [25, 26].
∈
S (HA′ ⊗ HS ) where ρS is any state in S (HS ). The states φ+
and |d+1ihd+1|⊗ρS are orthogonal since |d+1ihd+1| ∈ S (HA′)
is orthogonal to any state in S (HA). Moreover, the map
Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s preserves the orthogonality, i.e., Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ+)
is orthogonal to Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(|d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS ).

Lastly, we consider a state σ in the interior of the im-
age I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) of the map Id+1 ⊗ Λs. By σ being in the
interior we mean that there exist an open subset of states
X ⊂ I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) such that σ ∈ X. Since Λs is bijective
the image I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) is a subset of the set of states that has
the same dimensionality as the full set of states. This means
that for any state ρ there is a suﬃciently small p such that
(1 − p)σ + pρ ∈ I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs).

These three observations allows us to construct two states
ρ′ and ρ′′, both evolved from initial states, for which distin-
guishability increases if Vt,s is not CP, in the following way.
Since the state σ is in the interior of I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) there is some
suﬃciently small p such that the two states ρ′ = (1− p)σ+ pφ+
and ρ′′ = (1− p)σ+ p|d +1ihd +1|⊗ρS are both in I(Id+1 ⊗Λs).
From the orthogonality of φ+ and |d+1ihd+1|⊗ρS it follows
that ||ρ′ − ρ′′||1 = p||φ+ − |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS ||1 = 2p. Moreover,
Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ+) fails to be positive semideﬁnite if and only if
Vt,s is not CP, and if it has a negative eigenvalue it follows that
||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ+)||1 > 1. Since Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ+) is orthogonal to
Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(|d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS ) it follows that ||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(ρ′ −
ρ′′)||1 = p||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ+ − |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS )||1 = p||Id+1 ⊗
Vt,s(φ+)||1 + p||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(|d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS )||1.

Now it is clear that if Vt,s is CP, the distinguishability does
not change between time s and time t, i.e., ||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(ρ′ −
ρ′′)||1 = ||ρ′ − ρ′′||1 = 2p. But if Vt,s is not CP, it follows

4

the operator ∆∗ that witnesses the non-Markovianity of the
evolution over this time interval, i.e., ||Id ⊗ Vt,s(∆∗)||1 > ||∆∗||1,
cannot be constructed from states inside the image of the ﬁrst
map, I(Id ⊗ Λs).

Our results ensure that such states exist. Moreover, with
the aid of Lemma 2, we were able to show that information
backﬂow can be observed for all non-CP-divisible evolutions,
including dynamical maps that are not bijective. For the sake
of completeness, in Appendix VI E we show that the existence
of an operator ∆∗ witnessing that Vt,s is not CP, implies the
existence of another operator ∆′ that is constructed from states
in the image I(Id ⊗Λs) and also serves as a witness of the non-
CP-divisibillity of the same map.

The two above issues of observability of information back-
ﬂows and non-bijectivity of the dynamical maps, were suc-
cessfully addressed in Ref. [20]. There, information back-
ﬂow was measured as an increase of the guessing probability
for ensemble of states, of arbitrary size and prior probabil-
ities.
It is then shown that for any non-CP-divisible evolu-
tion, there exists an ensemble whose guessing probability in-
creases. They also prove that this ensemble can consists only
of separable states. Unfortunately, no recipe is provided to
construct the required ensemble and, in particular, no upper
bound on its size is given. This severely limits the operational
consequences of the result as it makes it practically impossi-
ble to employ. Our results do not suﬀer from these issues and
prove that the simplest ensemble consisting of two states with
the same prior probability suﬃces to determine if a dynamical
map is CP-divisible, even without entanglement.

The cost of obtaining all the above advantages is an in-
crease of the dimensionality of the ancillary system from d
to d + 1. However, the payoﬀ, apart from all the above re-
sults, is that for any bijective dynamical map that is not CP,
our results provide a construction of pairs of initial states that
detect the information backﬂow. Finally, we showed that any
non-CP-divisible dynamical map can be witnessed by a pair of
separable states. This result goes against intuition, since the
CP property of dynamical maps is necessary due to possible
entanglement between the evolving system and an ancilla.

FIG. 1. The construction of two states ρ′ and ρ′′ inside the image
of I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) (grey area), and detecting that the evolution is not
CP-divisible, is obtained by mixing states φ+ and |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS
with a state σ in the interior of I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs).

that ||Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(ρ′ − ρ′′)||1 > ||ρ′ − ρ′′||1 = 2p, i.e., the dis-
tinguishability increases. Thus the two states ρ′ and ρ′′ serve
as a witness of any evolution in the timestep between s and
t that cannot be described by a CP map. Since Λs is bijec-
tive the initial states that evolve into ρ′ and ρ′′ can be con-
structed as Λ−1
s (ρ′′). Note that, from Corollary
1, it follows that the two states can always be constructed as
separable states, by choosing the state σ from the interior of
the subset of separable states contained in I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) and p
small enough.

V. DISCUSSION

In this work, we have demonstrated the equivalence of two
a priori complementary concepts of quantum Markovianity,
CP-divisibility, which provides a mathematical description of
dynamical map, and information ﬂow, which gives a physical
interpretation to the memoryless feature of Markovian dynam-
ics. In what follows we emphasise and discuss the advances
in comparison with the results known from the literature.

As explained above, the results of Ref. [17], valid only for
bijective dynamical maps, show that the non-CP-divisibility
of an evolution can be detected by a Helstrom matrix ∆∗ de-
ﬁned by two states ρ1 and ρ2 with prior probabilities p and
1 − p. Unfortunately, they do not explicitly ensure that when-
ever the CP-divisibility of a dynamical map Λt is violated at
time interval [s, t], there exist initial states that witness it dur-
ing the actual evolution. In fact, it is a priori conceivable that

A. Terminology

Let H = Cd ⊗ Cd+1 be the Hilbert space of the system and
ancilla where Cd is the Hilbert space HS of the system and
Cd+1 is the Hilbert space of the ancilla. Furthermore, let HA
and HA′ be two orthogonal subspaces isomorphic to Cd and
C, respectively, of the ancilla Hilbert space Cd+1. Let HA′ be
spanned by the vector |d + 1i.

Let L(HS ) be the space of linear operators on HS . Similarly
let L(HS ⊗ HA) and L(H) be the spaces of linear operators on
HA ⊗ HS and H, respectively. The subset of positive semi-
deﬁnite trace one linear operators is the set of physical states.
Let Λs : L(HS ) → L(HS ) and Λt : L(HS ) → L(HS ) be
CP maps. Furthermore, let I(Λs) be the image of Λs acting on
L(HS ). We also consider the extension Id ⊗ Λs of the map Λs
to the space L(HA ⊗ HS ). We denote the image of Id ⊗ Λs
acting on L(HA ⊗ HS ) by I(Id ⊗ Λs). Finally, let Id+1 ⊗ Λs be

the extension of Λs to L(H) and let I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) be its image.

B. Proof of Lemma 1

Assume that there exist a linear map Vt,s : L(HS ) → L(HS )

such that Λt = Vt,sΛs.

Any linear map can be described by its action on a set of ba-
sis vectors. We choose an orthogonal basis {ei} of L(H) such
that Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) is the smallest subspace that contains
I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs).

This means that each vector ei for i ≤ k can be chosen as the
diﬀerence ρi − σ between a ﬁxed state σ ∈ I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) and
some ρi which is also in I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs). The other basis vectors,
i > k, can be chosen as ρi − σ for states ρi < I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs)

Since the map Id+1 ⊗ Λs acts like the identity on any oper-
ator on the ancilla Hilbert space the image I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) nec-
essarily contains more than one state. Because of this, and
because the image I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) is a convex set, we can always
choose the state σ to be an interior point in I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs), i.e.,
there is a set X ⊂ I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) which is open when considered
as a subset of Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) and contains σ.

Any state in L(H) can thus be expressed as σ + Pi≤k ciei +
Pi>k ciei for some ci ∈ R. The action of the map Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s
on any basis vector ei for i > k is irrelevant for the evolu-
tion of the system. We therefore have a certain freedom of
choice of the map Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s, and we can always choose it
such that it maps every state of the form Pi>k ciei + ρ, where
ρ ∈ Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) and ci ∈ R to an operator with non-
negative eigenvalues if Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(ρ) is non-negative. A trivial
example is the choice of action Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(ei) = 0 for all i > k.

Therefore we have two options:

1. Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s maps every state in Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) into
a state with non-negative eigenvalues. Then we can
choose the action of Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s on the basis vectors ei,
i > k such that Id+1⊗Vt,s maps all states to non-negative
operators. Thus we can choose Vt,s to be CP.

2. Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s maps some state φ ∈ Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) into
an operator with a negative eigenvalue. Then we can
not choose Vt,s to be CP.

We can thus conclude that if Vt,s cannot be chosen as a
CP map there exists a state φ in Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) such that
Id+1⊗Vt,s(φ) has a negative eigenvalue. In particular by Choi’s
Theorem [25] we can chose the state φ ∈ L(HA ⊗ HS ).

Next we make the following observation. The image
I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) must contain a state in L(HA′ ⊗ HS ) of the form
|d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS since any separable state |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ˜ρS
must be mapped into a state of this form by Id+1 ⊗ Λs.

Using this observation and assuming that a state φ exist we
can make the following construction. There exist some suf-
ﬁciently small p such that ρ′ = (1 − p)σ + pφ and ρ′′ =
(1 − p)σ + p|d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS are both in I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs).

Since φ and |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS are orthogonal it follows that
||ρ′ − ρ′′||1 = p||φ − |d + 1ihd + 1| ⊗ ρS ||1 = 2p. Furthermore,
the map Id+1 ⊗Vt,s preserves orthogonality of these two states,
i.e., Id+1 ⊗Vt,s(φ) is orthogonal to Id+1⊗Vt,s(|d+1ihd+1|⊗ρS ).

Since Id+1 ⊗ Vt,s(φ) by assumption has negative eigenvalues it
follows that ||Id+1⊗Vt,s(φ)||1 > 1. This implies ||Id+1⊗Vt,s(ρ′−
ρ′′)||1 = p||Id+1⊗Vt,s(φ−|d+1ihd+1|⊗ρS)||1 > ||ρ′−ρ′′||1 = 2p.
Thus the distinguishability increases if the map Vt,s is not
CP. Moreover, if the map does increase the distinguishability
it is not CP [22]. Hence the distinguishability increases if and
only if the map Vt,s is not CP.

C. Proof of Lemma 2

Let Λs and Λt be the dynamical maps describing the evolu-
tion from the initial time to time s and t respectively. Assume
that s < t.

If Λs is invertible there exist a linear map Vt,s such that Λt =
Vt,sΛs, given by Vt,s = ΛtΛ−1
s . If on the other hand Λs is not
invertible there exist two states ρ1 and ρ2 such that Id+1 ⊗
Λs(ρ1) = Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρ2). The diﬀerence ρ1 − ρ2 between the
two states deﬁnes a vector in L(H). The linear span of this
vector deﬁnes a subspace W such that all operators in W are
mapped to the same state by Id+1 ⊗ Λs.

Let (ρi

1, ρi
2) be a collection of pairs of states satisfying
1) = Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρi
Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρi
2), such that taken together they
describe all subspaces Wi that are mapped to single states by
Id+1 ⊗ Λs.

Next, consider the following. Assume that the map Id+1 ⊗
Λt does not satisfy Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρi
2) for one of
these pairs. It follows that ||Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρi
2)||1 > 0. But
since ||Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρi
2)||1 = 0, this implies that there is an
increase in distinguishability between s and t. Note that in this
case there is no map Vt,s since the evolution is one-to-many.

1) = Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρi

1 − ρi

1 − ρi

1) = Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρi

Now let us assume that the evolution does not increase
the distinguishability. If we assume non-increase of distin-
guishability it cannot be that Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρi
1) , Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρi
2)
while Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρi
2) by the above argu-
ment. This means that every subspace Wi that Id+1 ⊗ Λs maps
into a single state, must also be mapped to a single state by
Id+1 ⊗ Λt. This property allows us to construct a map from
the state Id+1 ⊗ Λs(Wi) to the subspace Wi, and from Wi to the
state Id+1 ⊗ Λt(Wi). That is, we have a map from the states
Id+1 ⊗ Λs(Wi) to the states Id+1 ⊗ Λt(Wi) for all i.

Therefore, we can now replace the domain of Id+1 ⊗ Λs and
Id+1 ⊗ Λt by a domain where each subspace Wi is replaced by
a single state, i.e., for each Wi we make a projection onto the
orthogonal complement of Wi. Let Id+1 ⊗ ˜Λs and Id+1 ⊗ ˜Λt
denote the linear maps on the new domain. Now we note that
Id+1 ⊗ ˜Λs, and therefore ˜Λs, is an invertible map, and thus the
map Vt,s is given by Vt,s = ˜Λt ˜Λ−1
s .

We can therefore conclude that when the evolution is such
that the distinguishability is non-increasing there exist a linear
map Vt,s. If the evolution is such that the distinguishability
increases, the map Vt,s may or may not exist.

D. Proof of Corollary 1

The set of separable states is convex and of the same di-
mensionality as the full set of states. Consider an orthogonal

6

basis {ei}, which has the smallest possible number of basis
vectors compatible with the full set of states being contained
in Span({ei}). Then the set of separable states cannot be con-
tained in any subspace spanned by less than the full set of the
basis vectors.

Any linear map can be described by its action on the set of
basis vectors. Therefore, for a linear map that maps separa-
ble states to separable states, the dimensionality of the set of
separable states changes in the same ways as the dimension-
ality of the full set of states. If Λs is a dynamical map such
that Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) is the smallest subspace that contains
I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs), then Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek) is also the smallest sub-
space that contains the image of the set of the separable states
under Id+1 ⊗ Λs. Moreover, the image of a convex set under
a linear map is convex and I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) is always of pos-
itive dimension. Therefore, there exists a state σ such that
it is contained in a set X ⊂ I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs) that contains only
separable states and is open when considered as a subset of
Span(e1, e2, . . . , ek).

We can now make the following observation. Theorem 1
implies that if the evolution is not CP-divisible there exists
two times s and t, s < t, and two states ρ1 and ρ2 such that
||Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρ1 − ρ2)||1 < ||Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρ1 − ρ2)||1. If we construct
two states ρ′ = (1 − p)σ + pρ1 and ρ′′ = (1 − p)σ + pρ2 it is
then clear that ||Id+1 ⊗ Λs(ρ′ − ρ′′)||1 < ||Id+1 ⊗ Λt(ρ′ − ρ′′)||1.
Moreover, for some suﬃciently small p both ρ′ and ρ′′ are in
the image of separable states under Id+1 ⊗ Λs which in turn is
a subset of the separable states contained in I(Id+1 ⊗ Λs).

We can thus conclude that for any evolution that is not
CP-divisible there exist separable states for which the dis-
tinguishability as measured by the trace distance increases in
some timestep.

E. Addendum to the Theorem of Reference [17]

Assume that ||Id ⊗ Vt,s(∆p)||1 > ||∆p||1 for the Helstrom ma-
trix ∆p = pρ1 − (1 − p)ρ2. If ρ1 and ρ2 are not in I(Id ⊗ Λs)
we can consider the following construction. We rewrite ∆ as
pρ1 − (1 − p)ρ2 = (1/r − 1)pσ + pρ1 − (1/r − 1)pσ − (1 − p)ρ2
where σ is a state in the interior of I(Id ⊗ Λs). Then, we mul-
tiply by a constant r/(2p + r − 2rp) = 1/T r[(1/r − 1)pσ +
pρ1 + (1/r − 1)pσ + (1 − p)ρ2] and re-express it as

r

2p + r − 2rp

1

2p + r − 2rp

[(1 − r)pσ + rpρ1]

∆p =

1

−

2p + r − 2rp

[(1 − r)pσ + r(1 − p)ρ2] =

y[(1 − r)σ + rρ1] − (1 − y)[(1 − x)σ + xρ2],

(3)

where x = r(1 − p)/(p + r −2rp) and y = p/(2p + r −2rp). The
constant r/(2p + r − 2rp) was chosen such that for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1
both (1 − r)σ + rρ1 and (1 − x)σ + xρ2 are positive hermitian
trace one operators.

Now, we observe that x goes to zero continuously when r
goes to zero continuously. Therefore both (1 − r)σ + rρ1 and
(1 − x)σ + xρ2 goes towards σ when r goes towards zero.

There is therefore some suﬃciently small r for which (1 −
r)σ + rρ1 and (1 − x)σ + xρ2 are both inside I(Id ⊗ Λs). For
such an r we can thus interpret r/(2p+r −2rp)∆ as a Helstrom
matrix for two operators in I(Id ⊗ Λs).

Thus, the existence of a Helstrom matrix ∆p = pρ1 − (1 −
p)ρ2 such that ||Id ⊗ Vt,s(∆p)||1 > ||∆p||1 implies the existence
of another Helstrom matrix ∆′
1 and
y = yρ′
2 are in I(Id ⊗ Λs) and ||Id ⊗ Vt,s(∆′
ρ′

1 − (1 − y)ρ′
y)||1 > ||∆′
