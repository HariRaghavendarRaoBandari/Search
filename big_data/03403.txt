BORN-JORDAN PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

WITH SYMBOLS IN THE SHUBIN CLASSES

ELENA CORDERO, MAURICE DE GOSSON, AND FABIO NICOLA

Abstract. We apply Shubin’s theory of global symbol classes Γm
ρ to
the Born-Jordan pseudodiﬀerential calculus we have previously devel-
oped. This approach has many conceptual advantages, and makes the
relationship between the conﬂicting Born-Jordan and Weyl quantization
methods much more limpid. We give, in particular, precise asymptotic
expansions of symbols allowing to pass from Born-Jordan quantization
to Weyl quantization, and vice-versa. In addition we state and prove
some regularity and global hypoellipticity results.

1. Introduction

The Born-Jordan quantization rules [5, 6, 8] have recently been rediscov-
ered in mathematics and have quickly become a very active area of research
under the impetus of scientists working in signal theory and time-frequency
analysis [1, 2, 9, 12].
It has been realized, not only that the associated
phase space picture has many advantages compared with the usual Weyl–
Wigner picture (it allows a strong damping of unwanted interference pat-
terns [1, 11]), but also, as one of us has shown [19, 20, 21], that there is
strong evidence that Born-Jordan quantization might very well be the cor-
rect quantization method in quantum physics. Independently of these po-
tential applications, the Born-Jordan pseudo-diﬀerential calculus has many
interesting and diﬃcult features (some of them, as non-injectivity [10], being
even quite surprising) and deserve close attention. The involved mathemat-
ics is less straightforward than that of the usual Weyl formalism; for instance
Born-Jordan pseudo-diﬀerential calculus is not fully covariant under linear
symplectic transformations [17], which makes the study of the symmetries
of the operators much less straightforward than in the Weyl case.

In the present paper we set out to study the pseudo-diﬀerential calculus
associated with Born-Jordan quantization in the framework of Shubin’s [29]
global symbol classes. These results complement and extend those obtained
by us in [10].

To be precise, in the Weyl quantization scheme to any observable (symbol)
a(z), z ∈ R2n, deﬁned as a function or (temperate) distribution in phase

space, it is associated the Weyl operator

bAW =(cid:0) 1

2π(cid:1)nZ aσ(z)bT (z)d2nz

where aσ = Fσa is the symplectic Fourier transform of a and bT (z0) is the

Heisenberg operator given by

i
ℏ (p0x−

1
2 p0x0)ψ(x − x0).

bT (z0)ψ(x) = e

This is simply a phase space shift and, as a consequence of the Schwartz
kernel theorem, every continuous linear operator S(Rn) → S ′(Rn) can be
written in a unique way as a Weyl operator for a suitable symbol a ∈ S ′(R2n);
namely, it is a superposition of phase space shifts. In this functional frame-
work the Weyl correspondence between observables and operators is there-
fore one to one.

The Born-Jordan quantization of a symbol a(z) is instead deﬁned as

bABJ =(cid:0) 1

2π(cid:1)nZ aσ(z) sinc(cid:0) px

2(cid:1) bT (z)d2nz

2(cid:1) and in

with z = (x, p) and px = p · x. The presence of the function sinc(cid:0) px

particular its zeros make the corresponding quantization problem much more
subtle. It was proved in [10] that every linear continuous operator S(Rn) →
S ′(Rn) can still be written in Born-Jordan form, but the representation is no
longer unique. The Born-Jordan correspondence is anyway still surjective.
In this paper we continue this investigation by focusing on a particulary
relevant subclass of smooth symbols satisfying good growth conditions at
inﬁnity, namely Shubin’s classes [29]. Roughly speaking the main result
reads as follows. Within such symbol classes the Weyl symbol aW and the
corresponding Born-Jordan symbol aBJ are related by the following explicit
asymptotic expansions:

aW(x, p) ∼ Xα∈Nn

|α| even

α!(|α| + 1)(cid:18) i

2(cid:19)|α|

∂α

and

aBJ(x, p) ∼ Xα∈Nn

α!(cid:18) i

2(cid:19)|α|

∂α
x ∂α

p aW(x, p)

for suitable coeﬃcients cα (see (4.10) below).

These expansions seem remarkable, because at present there is no an exact
and explicit formula for the Born-Jordan symbol corresponding to a given
Weyl operator, although the existence of such a symbol was proved in [10].
Indeed, the situation seems deﬁnitely similar to what happens in the division
problem of temperate distributions by a (not identically zero) polynomial
P : the map f 7→ P f from S ′(Rn) into itself is onto but in general does not
exist a linear continuous right inverse [4, 26].

We refer to [30] for an alternative formulation of quantum observables by

formal series of noncommutative generators bx,bp.

We will systematically use properties of the global pseudo-diﬀerential cal-
culus whose study was initiated by Shubin, after related work by Beals,
Berezin, Kumano-go, Rabinoviˇc, and others (see the Bibliography in [29]).
This calculus plays an important role in quantum mechanics since the posi-
tion and momentum variables are placed on an equal footing in the estimates
deﬁning the symbol classes. We have found this approach particularly well
adapted to investigate asymptotic expansions such as those for aW and aBJ .
Natural related topics that we have not included in this work are the
spectral theory of Born-Jordan operators, in which the notion of global hy-
poellipticity plays a crucial role and the anti-Wick version of these operators
(the latter might lead to some new insights). Finally, we have not discussed
at all the Wigner–Moyal formalism associated with Born-Jordan question;
for the latter we refer to [1, 11, 19].

In short, the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the def-
inition of the Born-Jordan pseudodiﬀerential operators. Section 3 is devoted
to Shubin’s symbol classes. In Section 4 we prove the above relationships
between Weyl and Born-Jordan symbol. Finally Section 5 is devoted to
applications to the global regularity problem.

2. Born-Jordan pseudo-differential Operators

In this section we review the recent advances in the theory of Born-Jordan
quantization; for proofs and details we refer to Cordero et al. [10], de Gosson
[17, 19, 20].

2.1. The Born-Jordan quantization rules. Following Heisenberg’s in-
sightful work on “matrix mechanics” Born and Jordan [5, 6] proposed the
quantization rule

for monomials. Their rule conﬂicts with Weyl’s [32] quantization rule, lead-
ing to

(McCoy rule [28]) as soon as r ≥ 2 and s ≥ 2. The following observation is
crucial: both quantizations are obtained from Shubin’s τ -rule

but by very diﬀerent means. In fact, the Weyl rule (2.2) is directly obtained
by choosing τ = 1
2 while Born and Jordan’s rule (2.1) is obtained by aver-
aging the right-hand side of (2.3) with respect to τ over the interval [0, 1]
(de Gosson and Luef [22], de Gosson [17, 19]).

On the operator level, the Weyl operator bAW = OpW(a) is given by the

familiar formula due to Weyl himself [32]

where aσ = Fσa is the symplectic Fourier transform

bAW =(cid:0) 1
aσ(z) =(cid:0) 1

ℏ σ(ˆz,z0) is the Heisenberg operator; recall [15, 27] that the

and bT (z0) = e− i
action of bT (z0) on a function or distribution ψ is explicitly given by

i
ℏ (p0x−

1
2 p0x0)ψ(x − x0).

(2.6)

Let us underline that the parameter ℏ ∈ (0, 1] is ﬁxed in our context. Here
we are not interested in the semi-classical analysis, i.e. the asymptotic as
ℏ → 0.

Using Plancherel’s identity formula (2.4) can be rewritten

bT (z0)ψ(x) = e

veriﬁes that under suitable convergence conditions (for instance a ∈ S(R2n)
and ψ ∈ L1(Rn)) one recovers the more familiar “mid-point formula”

be given a rigorous meaning by (2.7)). The easiest way to deﬁne Shubin’s

lowing result gives an explicit expression of the Weyl symbol of a Born-
Jordan operator with arbitrary symbol (see [1, 10]):

Weyl operator OpW(b) where

Recall that the function sinc is deﬁned by sinc u = sin u/u for u 6= 0 and

sinc 0 = 1.

It follows from (2.4) and the convolution formula Fσ(a∗θ) = (2π)naσθσthat

bABJ is alternatively given by

3.1. The Shubin symbol class Γm
deﬁnition (Shubin [29], Deﬁnition 23.1):

ρ . We begin by giving the following

ρ (R2n)
Deﬁnition 1. Let m ∈ R and 0 < ρ ≤ 1. The symbol class Γm
consists of all complex functions a ∈ C ∞(R2n) such that for every α ∈ N2n
there exists a constant Cα ≥ 0 with

for z ∈ R2n.

It immediately follows from this deﬁnition that if a ∈ Γm

N2n then ∂α

under linear automorphisms of phase space (this property does not hold for
the usual H¨ormander classes Sm

by growth properties in only the variable p). Let us denote by GL(2n, R)

3.2. Asymptotic expansions of symbols. Let us recall the notion of
asymptotic expansion of a symbol a ∈ Γm

ρ (R2n) (cf. [29], Deﬁnition 23.2):

Deﬁnition 2. Let (aj)j be a sequence of symbols aj ∈ Γmj
ρ (R2n) such that
limj→+∞ mj → −∞. Let a ∈ C ∞(R2n). If for every integer r ≥ 2 we have

where mr = maxj≥r mj we will write a ∼P∞

The interest of the asymptotic expansion comes from the fact that every
ρ (R2n), the degrees mj being strictly

sequence of symbols (aj)j with aj ∈ Γmj
decreasing and such that mj → −∞, determines a symbol in some Γm
that symbol being unique up to an element of S(R2n):

follows from (3.3).

3.3. The amplitude classes Πm

ρ (R2n) deﬁned above. Since Born-Jordan

ρ (Rn) consists of all operators S(Rn) −→ S(Rn) with distributional
kernel K ∈ S(Rn × Rn). It is useful to make the following remark: in the
standard theory of pseudo-diﬀerential operators (notably in its applications
to partial diﬀerential operators) it is customary to use operators

ρ (Rn) (cf.

which correspond, replacing p with ξ to the choice  = 1 in the expression
(3.5). It is in fact easy to toggle between the expression above and its -
dependent version: one just replaces a(x, y, ξ) with a(x, y, p) and ξ with p/

so that dξ = −ndp. However, when doing this, one must be careful to check
that the amplitude a(x, y, ξ) and a(x, y, ξ) belong to the same symbol class.
That this is indeed always the case when one deals with Shubin classes is
clear from Lemma 1. The following situation is important in our context;
consider the  = 1 Weyl operator

bAψ(x) =(cid:0) 1

2π(cid:1)nZZ ei(x−y)ξa( 1

2 (x + y), ξ)ψ(y)dnydnξ.

Using the symbol estimates (3.1) it is straightforward to show that every
ρ (Rn) is a continuous operator S(Rn) −→ S(Rn) and can
hence be extended into a continuous operator S ′(Rn) −→ S ′(Rn). It follows

4.1. General results. Comparing the expressions (2.4) and (2.14) giving
the harmonic representations of respectively Weyl and Born-Jordan oper-

ators one sees that if bA = OpW(a) = OpBJ(b) then the symbols a and b

are related by the convolution relation b ∗ θBJ = a; equivalently, taking the
(symplectic) Fourier transform of each side

(4.1)

aσ(z) = bσ(z) sinc(cid:16) px
2(cid:17) .

The diﬃculty in recovering bσ from aσ comes from the fact that the sinc
function has inﬁnitely many zeroes; in fact sinc(px/2) = 0 for all points
z = (x, p) such that px = 2N π for a non-zero integer N . We are thus
confronted with a division problem. Notice in addition that if the solution
b exists then it is not unique: assume that c(z) = e−iσ(z,z0)/ where p0x0 =
2N π (N ∈ Z, N 6= 0). We have cσ(z) = (2π)nδ(z − z0) and hence by
(2.14)

OpBJ(c) =Z δ(z − z0) sinc(cid:0) px

2(cid:1) bT (z)d2nz = 0.

It follows that if OpBJ(b) = OpW(a) then we also have OpBJ(b + c) =
OpW(a). Now, in [10, Theorem 7] we have proven that the equation (4.1)
always has a (non-unique) solution in b ∈ S(R2n) for every given a ∈ S(R2n);

10

ELENA CORDERO, MAURICE DE GOSSON, AND FABIO NICOLA

our proof used the theory of division of distributions. Thus every Weyl
operator has a Born-Jordan symbol; equivalently

Proposition 4. For every continuous linear operator bA : S(Rn) −→ S ′(Rn)
there exists b ∈ S ′(R2n) such that bA = OpBJ(b).

Notice that the existence of the solution b of (4.1), as established in [10],
is a purely qualitative result; it does not tell us anything on the properties
of that solution.

4.2. Weyl symbol of a Born-Jordan operator. We are going to show
that every Born-Jordan operator with symbol in one of the Shubin classes
ρ (R2n) is a Weyl operator with symbol in the same symbol class and pro-
Γm
duce an asymptotic expansion for the latter. For this we will need the
following elementary inequalities:

Lemma 2. Let ξ and η be positive numbers and m ∈ R. We have

(4.2)
where C = max{1, 2−m} and

min{ξm, ηm} ≤ C(ξ + η)m

(4.3)

(1 + |ξ − η|2)m ≤ 2|m|(1 + |ξ|2)m(1 + |η|2)|m|

Proof. Proof of (4.2). The case m ≥ 0 is straightforward: we have

min{ξm, ηm} ≤ ξm + ηm ≤ (ξ + η)m.

Suppose m < 0; if ξ ≤ η we have

min{ξm, ηm} = ηm ≤ 2−m(ξ + η)m;

the case ξ > η follows in the same way. Proof of (4.3): see for instance
Chazarain and Piriou [7] or H¨ormander [25].

The estimate (4.3) is usually referred to as Peetre’s inequality in the

literature on pseudo-diﬀerential operators.

Proof. Property (ii) follows from (i) choosing τ = 1

pseudo-diﬀerential operator bAτ = Opτ (a):

and set

We thus have, using (2.11),

 p(x−y)aBJ(x, y, p)ψ(y)dnydnp

which is of the type (3.5). Let us show that aBJ ∈ Πm

for some m′ ∈ R independent of α, β, γ. The result will follow using Propo-
sition 3. Let us set

bτ (x, y, p) = a((1 − τ )x + τ y, p);

we have

y ∂γ

p bτ (x, y, p) = (1 − τ )|α|τ |β|(∂α+β

y ∂γ

p bτ (x, y, p)| ≤ Cα+β,γ(1 − τ )|α|τ |β|h((1 − τ )x + τ y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|.

Now, by Peetre’s inequality (4.3) there exists a constant C = C(m, ρ, α, β, γ) >
0 such that the estimates

h((1 − τ )x + τ y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ| ≤ Ch(x, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|hτ (x − y)i|m|+ρ|α+β+γ|

and

h((1−τ )x+τ y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ| ≤ Ch(y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|h(1−τ )(x−y)i|m|+ρ|α+β+γ|

hold, hence

h((1 − τ )x + τ y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ| ≤

C min{h(x, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|, h(y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|}hx − yi|m|+ρ|α+β+γ|.

This implies, using the inequality (4.2), that

h((1 − τ )x + τ y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ| ≤ C ′h(x, y, p)im−ρ|α+β+γ|hx − yi|m|+ρ|α+β+γ|.

Together with (4.8) this inequality implies (4.7) with m′ = |m| after an inte-
gration on τ . The asymptotic expansion (4.4) follows by using the expansion

of the τ -symbol aτ in (3.8), in terms of the amplitude b(x, y, p) = aBJ(x, y, p)

we immediately obtain the asymptotic expansion for aτ (x, p) in (4.4). This
concludes the proof.

Notice that the asymptotic formula (4.5) yields exact results when the
Born-Jordan symbol a is a polynomial in the variables xj, pk. For instance,
when n = 1 and a(z) = ars(z) = xrps it leads to

We refer to Domingo and Galapon [23] for a general discussion of quantiza-
tion of monomials.

Using [29], Deﬁnition 23.4, the result above has the following interesting

consequence:

Corollary 1. A Born-Jordan operator bABJ = OpBJ(a) with symbol a ∈

ρ (R2n) belongs to Gm
Γm

ρ (Rn).

BORN-JORDAN PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS

13

This result reduces in many cases the study of Born-Jordan operators to

that of Shubin operators.

4.3. The Born-Jordan symbol of a Weyl operator. We now address
the more diﬃcult problem of ﬁnding the Born-Jordan symbol of a given
ρ (R2n). As already observed the analysis in [10] did
Weyl operator in Gm
not provide an explicit formula for it because of division problems.
It is
remarkable that, nevertheless, an explicit and general asymptotic expansion
can be written down when the symbol belongs to one of the classes Γm
ρ (R2n).
To this end we need a preliminary lemma about the formal power series
arising in (4.5).

Lemma 3. Consider the power series

Xα∈Nn

Its formal reciprocal is given by the series Pα∈Nn

.

Proof. The proof is straightforward: we expand

(cid:16)1 + X|α|6=0 even

1

α!(|α| + 1)

xα(cid:17)−1

as a geometric series and collect the similar terms. Alternatively, we could
also apply the Fa`a di Bruno formula generalizing the chain rule to the deriva-
tives at x = 0 of the function x 7−→ g(f (x)) where g(t) = 1/(1 + t) and

f (x) = P|α|6=0 even

α!(|α|+1) xα.

Let us now prove our second main result:

Theorem 2. Consider a Weyl operator bAW = OpW(a) with Weyl symbol

a ∈ Γm

Let bABJ = OpBJ(b) be the corresponding Born-Jordan operator. Then

(4.12)

bABJ = bAW + R

14

ELENA CORDERO, MAURICE DE GOSSON, AND FABIO NICOLA

where R is a pseudodiﬀerential operator with symbol in the Schwartz space
S(R2n).

Proof. The operator bABJ = OpBJ(b) by Theorem 1 can be written as a Weyl

operator with Weyl symbol

As in the case of formula (4.9), the asymptotic expansion (4.11) becomes

instance, assuming n = 1 choose a(z) = ars(z) = xrps. Then the formula
above yields

where the Bk are the Bernoulli numbers deﬁned in (4.15).

We also make the following remark: formulas (4.13) and (4.14) show that
(modulo a term in S(R2n)) a Weyl operator with symbol in Γm
ρ (R2n) has a
ρ (R2n). This is however
Born-Jordan symbol belonging to the same class Γm
by no means a uniqueness result since, as we have already observed, we
have OpBJ(b + c) = 0 for all symbols c(z) = e−iσ(z,z0)/ where p0x0 = 2N π
(N ∈ Z, N 6= 0). Observe that such a symbol c belongs to none of the
symbol classes Γm

ρ (R2n).

5. Regularity and Global Hypoellipticity Results

In order to deﬁne the Sobolev–Shubin spaces (cf. [29], Deﬁnition 25.3),
we recall the deﬁnition of anti-Wick operators. The anti-Wick operator
OpAW(a) with symbol a is deﬁned by

OpAW(a)f =Z a(z)Pzf d2nz,

where Pzf (t) = hf, ΦziΦz(t) are orthogonal projections on L2(Rn) on the
functions

Φz(t) = π−n/4eitpe− |t−x|2

2

,

z = (x, p) ∈ R2n

(i.e., phase-space shifts of the Gaussian π−n/4e− |t|2
Deﬁnition 4. For s ∈ R consider the anti-Wick symbol hzis, z ∈ R2n, and
let As = OpAW(a) be the corresponding anti-Wick operator. The Sobolev–
Shubin space Qs is deﬁned by

2 ).

Qs = {f ∈ S′(Rn) : Asf ∈ L2(Rn)} = A−1

s L2(Rn).

We then have the following continuity result for Born-Jordan operators:

Proposition 5. Let bABJ = OpBJ(a) with symbol a ∈ Γm

bABJ : Qs(Rn) → Qs−m(Rn).

ρ (R2n). We have

ELENA CORDERO, MAURICE DE GOSSON, AND FABIO NICOLA

Proof. By Corollary (1) the operator bABJ is in the class Gm

follows by applying Theorem 25.2 in [29].

ρ (Rn). The result

It turns out that the Sobolev–Shubin spaces are particular cases of Fe-
ichtinger’s modulation spaces [13, 14, 24]; we do not discuss these here and
refer to Cordero et al [12] for a study of continuity properties of Born-Jordan
operators in these spaces. In fact, our reduction result Theorem 1 allows
to transpose to Born-Jordan operators all known regularity results for Weyl
operators with symbol in the symbol classes Γm

ρ (R2n). For instance:

Proposition 6. Let a ∈ Γ0
operator on L2(Rn).

ρ(R2n). Then bABJ = OpBJ(a) is a bounded

Proof. In view of Theorem 24.3 in [29] every Weyl operator with symbol in
Γ0
ρ(R2n) is bounded on L2(Rn); the result follows in view of Theorem 1 (ii).

We next recall the notion of global hypoellipticity [29, 31], which plays
an important role in the study of spectral theory for pseudo-diﬀerential

operators (see the monograph [3] by Boggiatto et al.). An operator bA :

S ′(Rn) −→ S ′(Rn) which also maps S(Rn) into itself is globally hypoelliptic
if

ψ ∈ S ′(Rn) and bAψ ∈ S(Rn) =⇒ ψ ∈ S(Rn).

(global hypoellipticity is thus not directly related to usual notion of hypoel-
lipticity [25], which is a local notion).

In [29] Shubin introduces the following subclass of Γm

ρ (R2n):

Deﬁnition 5. Let m, m0 ∈ R and 0 < ρ ≤ 1. The symbol class HΓm,m0
consists of all complex functions a ∈ C ∞(R2n) such that

ρ

(R2n)

C0 hzim0 ≤ |a(z)| ≤ C1 hzim for |z| > R,

for some C0, C1, R > 0 and whose derivatives satisfy the following property:
for every α ∈ N2n there exists Cα > 0 such that

|∂α

z a(z)| ≤ Cα|a(z)| hzi−ρ|α|

for |z| > R.

The symbol class HΓm,m0

ρ

(R2n) is insensitive to perturbations by lower

order terms ([29], Lemma 25.1, (c)):

Lemma 4. Let a ∈ HΓm,m0
a + b ∈ HΓm,m0

(R2n).

ρ

ρ

(R2n) and b ∈ Γm′

ρ (R2n).

If m′ < m0 then

The interest of these symbol classes comes from the following property

if a ∈ HΓm,m0

[29]:
ally hypoelliptic. For instance, the Hermite operator −∆ + |x|2 is globally
hypoelliptic since its Weyl symbol is a(z) = |z|2, which is in HΓ2,2
1 (R2n).

(R2n) then the Weyl operator bA = OpW(a) is glob-

Moreover, if bA = OpW(a) with a ∈ HΓm,m0

result holds:

ρ

symbol aW of bABJ belongs to the class HΓm,m0

Proof. In view of the discussion above it suﬃces to show that the Weyl

(R2n) hence the result follows using of Lemma

(ii) we have aW − a ∈ Γm−2ρ
