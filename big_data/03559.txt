ABSTRACT

Context.3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent ﬂows with initially magnetic and kinetic energies at equipartition spontaneously
develop a magnetic excess (or residual energy), as well in numerical simulations and in the solar wind. Closure equations obtained
in 1983 describe the residual spectrum as being produced by a dynamo source proportional to the total energy spectrum, balanced
by a linear Alfvén damping term. A good agreement was found in 2005 with incompressible simulations; however, recent solar wind
measurements disagree with these results.
Aims.The previous dynamo-Alfvén theory is generalized to a family of models, leading to simple relations between residual and total
energy spectra. We want to assess these models in detail against MHD simulations and solar wind data.
Methods. The family of models is tested against compressible decaying MHD simulations with low Mach number, low cross-helicity,
zero mean magnetic ﬁeld, without or with expansion terms (EBM or expanding box model).
Results.A single dynamo-Alfvén model is found to describe correctly both solar wind scalings and compressible simulations without
or with expansion. It is equivalent to the 1983-2005 closure equation but with critical balance of nonlinear turnover and linear Alfvén
times, while the dynamo source term remains unchanged. The discrepancy with previous incompressible simulations is elucidated.
The model predicts a linear relation between the spectral slopes of total and residual energies mR = −1/2+3/2mT . Examining the solar
wind data as in Chen et al. (2013), our relation is found to be valid whatever the cross-helicity, even better so at high cross-helicity,
with the total energy slope varying from 1.7 to 1.55.

1. Introduction

k ) and kinetic (EV

3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent ﬂows with initial
equipartition of magnetic (E M
k ) spectral en-
ergy density spontaneously develop a magnetic excess. In the
Solar Wind, the magnetic excess in the k−5/3 scaling range is
largest in the cold, slow wind with no or small mean ﬁeld
(e.g., Grappin et al. (1991); Bruno et al. (2007)). Recent mea-
surements have revealed that when the relative cross-helicity
σc = 2 hv · bi /(Dv2 + b2E) is smaller than 0.6, the residual en-
k adopts the scaling k−2 (Chen et al. 2013),
ergy ER
while the total energy ET

k = E M

k − EV

k = E M

k + EV

k scales as k−5/3.

formation and persistence of current

The origin of the magnetic excess in the solar wind has
been attributed to diﬀerent physical mechanisms: (i) rem-
nants of quasi-stationary solar magnetic structures (Bruno et al.
2007);
sheets
(Matthaeus & Lamkin 1986); (iii) selective decay of ideal in-
variants (Stribling & Matthaeus 1991); (iv) fully developed tur-
bulence. In the latter case, which interests us here, the residual
energy spectrum results from the competition between the linear
damping of Alfvén waves by the local mean ﬁeld, the Alfvén ef-
fect (Kraichnan 1965), and the magnetic stretching which is the
source proportional to the total energy spectrum (Grappin et al.
(1983) and Müller & Grappin (2005), later on MG05). We call it
the Alfvén-dynamo scenario. The model allows (in its stationary
version) to predict the residual energy spectrum, given the total
energy spectrum. In particular, it predicts that the slopes of total

energy (mT ) and residual energy (mR) satisfy:

mR = −1 + 2mT

(1)

which gives mR = 2 only if mT = 3/2, at variance with the solar
wind case, which shows in average mR ≃ 2 and mT ≃ 5/3. It is
important to remark that the model discussed here is not a cas-
cade theory: the magnetic excess is not a inviscid invariant, it is
assumed to be the passive by-product of the two eﬀects mention
above. So, the validity of our model is potentially more general
than the validity of, say, the Kolmogorov regime (e.g., Lee et al.
(2010)).

Criticism has been addressed to the use of the edqnm ap-
proximation to derive the dynamo-Alfvén equation. Indeed,
the small-scale dynamics in MHD turbulence should be domi-
nated by motions perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld,
which in turn should strongly reduce the inﬂuence of the Alfvén
eﬀect which is a basic part of the theory (Biskamp (2003), end
of Chapter 6). Several attempts have been made since then to
include anisotropy into the edqnm closure (Gogoberidze et al.
2012; Boldyrev et al. 2012); however in the case of a strong
cascade with no global mean ﬁeld, they lead to the prediction
ER
k = ET
k , at variance with our numerical ﬁndings and also the
solar wind as we will see.

Our aim here is (i) to investigate whether one can recover the
solar wind regime via numerical simulations of either standard
compressible 3D MHD equations or 3D EBM equations, that
is, compressible MHD including expansion terms (Grappin et al.

Article number, page 1 of 7

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. ms

1993; Grappin & Velli 1996); (ii) ﬁnd an appropriate framework
for a Alfvén-dynamo scenario describing simulations and the so-
lar wind that takes into account anisotropy.

We consider in this work the case with zero mean ﬁeld and
low cross-helicity, and small Mach number. Note that although
the solar wind is rarely strictly in a zero mean ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration (brms/B0 ≃ 0.5 for a period range from 10 to 2 hours,
B0 being the mean magnetic ﬁeld at the 10 hours scale, e.g.,
Roberts (1989)), the magnetic excess is dominant close to the
heliospheric current sheet where the mean ﬁeld is small, which
is the conﬁguration studied by Chen et al. (2013).

To provide a diagnostic tool for our simulations, we ﬁrst
generalize formally the Alfvén dynamo balance derived from
edqnm, by considering diﬀerent simple expressions for the char-
acteristic times of the dynamo source and the Alfvén sink. These
return diﬀerent scaling predictions for the residual energy spec-
trum, given the spectral slope for total energy, quantitative pre-
dictions for the relative levels of both spectra, and also relaxation
curves. We test these diﬀerent models against our simulations.

We ﬁnd that compressible MHD simulations, both standard
and with expansion (EBM), show a quasi-stationary regime cor-
responding to that found in the solar wind. This quasi-stationary
state is well described, qualitatively (scaling) and quantitatively
(amplitude) if we keep the dynamo source term as in the 1983
edqnm scenario, but change the Alfvén sink, taking into account
the critical balance between nonlinear coupling and linear prop-
agation. The relation between the residual and total energy spec-
tral slopes predicted by our theory applies not only to the zero
cross-helicity wind, but also to high-speed streams with relative
cross-helicity close to unity, and shallower spectral slopes.

We show that incompressible MG05 simulations diﬀer from
the compressible ones studied here insofar as the scaling law for
the residual energy actually depends on the kind of spectrum
used, whether reduced or isotropized. Such a dependence is not
observed in the compressible simulations considered here.

The plan is as follows. First we derive the family of Alfvén-
dynamo models relating the residual and total energy spectra.
Then we examine direct simulations of compressible MHD with
low Mach number, both with and without expansion terms in the
light of the diﬀerent Alfvén-dynamo models. The last section is
a discussion.

2. Generalizing the Alfvén-dynamo model

The Alfvén dynamo model is obtained starting from the incom-
pressible MHD equations and using the edqnm spectral closure.
It leads to a closed system of equations relating the diﬀerent
second-order moments of the system. The general form (with
Ek denoting either the kinetic, magnetic or residual energy spec-
trum) is ∂Ek = R dpdqkθEpEq. In the case of the residual en-
ergy, the integral may be separated in two, nonlocal and local,
contributions, leading respectively to a linear damping term and
a nonlinear source:
2ER
∂tER
where the characteristic times t0
is expressed in units of Alfvén velocity):
t0
A = 1/(kb0)

A and tNL are (the magnetic ﬁeld

tNL = 1/(k(u2 + b2)1/2) ≃ (k3/2(ET

and θ is the relaxation time of triple correlations (in principle
θ = t0
A, see below). Note that the form of the source term is

k )1/2)−1.

local, while some authors (e.g., Alexakis et al. (2005)) claim
that kinetic-magnetic exchange (other than the simple Alfvén
eﬀect) should show important non-local contributions. However,
(i) Aluie & Eyink (2010) have criticized the methodology of this
work; (ii) a workable non-local model would be very diﬃcult to
build, and as we will see, it works well in an (albeit modiﬁed)
local form.

We generalize now the edqnm model by writing instead of

eq. 2:

∂tER

k = −ER

k /tD + ET

k /tdyn

(5)

where the two times scales, tD (damping time) and tdyn (dynamo
time) can be chosen independently one from another. This leads
to the equilibrium solution:

ER
k /ET

k = tD/tdyn.

(6)

The edqnm model is described by eq. 2 with θ = t0
equivalent to eq. 5 with tD = t0
ER
k /ET

A and tdyn = t2

A/tNL)2.

k = (t0

NL/t0

A, and is thus
A, which leads to

Other expressions of the damping and dynamo times lead to

the general family of residual-total energy relations:

k /ET
ER

k = (t0

A/tNL)α

(7)

This leads to explicit relations between residual and total energy
spectra after replacing the nonlinear time as a function of the
total energy spectrum as in eq. 4:

ER
k = b−α

0 kα/2(ET

k )1+α/2

(8)

Also, the following relation holds between spectral slopes (ET
k−mT , ER

k ∝ k−mR):

k ∝

mR = −α/2 + mT (1 + α/2)

(9)

Diﬀerent values of α can be obtained by using the following ex-
pressions of the damping and dynamo timescales in terms of the
basic timescales t0

A and tNL:

tD = tNL
tD = t0
A
tD = tNL
tD = t0
A

tdyn = tNL
tdyn = tNL
tdyn = t2
tdyn = t2

NL/t0

α = 0
α = 1
α = 1
α = 2

(10)
(11)
(12)
(13)

NL/t0

As a rule (except perhaps at the largest scales), one has t0
A <
tNL < t2
A, with the inequality becoming stronger at small
scales. The ﬁrst scenario (α = 0, damping and dynamo
both based on the nonlinear time tNL) is the simplest of all
(Gogoberidze et al. 2012): it leads to an extreme regime with
ER
k = ET
k at all scales, far both from solar wind and numerical
results as we will see.

The last scenario with fast damping and slow dynamo based
on the long diﬀusive time tdyn = t2
A, is the edqnm prediction
studied in MG05; it leads to α = 2, hence to a fast decreasing
residual spectrum with slope mR = 7/3 when mT = 5/3.

NL/t0

The intermediate scenarios (respectively fast damping and
dynamo, and slow damping and dynamo) both lead to α = 1,
and hence to mR = 2 when mT = 5/3: they are thus candidates
for the description of the solar wind dynamics.

netic (dotted) rms amplitudes. (b) Kinetic (solid line) and magnetic (dot-

3. Numerical results

In this section we consider two decaying compressible simu-
lations with zero mean ﬁeld, low cross-helicity and resolution
5123: (i) 3D MHD (run A); (ii) 3D EBM (run B). In both cases,
the initial Mach number is small (and remains so), thus mini-
mizing compressible eﬀects. Our main issue in this section is to
assess eq. 7: are the numerical results for equilibrium residual
energy well described by one of the two algebraic models α = 1
or α = 2, and, accordingly, do the spectral scalings satisfy the
corresponding eq. 9 ?

3.1. Compressibleturbulence

The ﬁrst run (A) has random isotropic initial conditions with
urms = brms = 1, ∇.u = 0, equal magnetic and kinetic ener-
gies with spectra conﬁned to k ≤ 2. Initial relative cross-helicity
is 0.17, density is unity, pressure is uniform with sound speed
cs = (5/3 P/ρ)1/2 ≃ 8, initial Mach number M0 = urms/cs ≃
0.12. The domain is a cube of size L0 = 2π.

The evolution of rms velocity (solid line) and magnetic
(dotted line) ﬂuctuations vs time is shown in the left panel of
ﬁg. 1, during twelve nonlinear times 1/(k0urms(t=0)). The Tay-
lor wavenumbers computed on the kinetic (solid) and magnetic
(dotted) energy spectrum are shown in the right panel. One sees
that the kinetic energy is transfered to magnetic energy in about
two nonlinear times, while small-scales wait up to about six non-
linear times to be fully excited, as indicated by the peaks of the
Taylor wavenumbers. The relative cross-helicity (not shown in
the ﬁgure) increases during the run from 0.17 to about 0.3.

We consider now reduced 1D energy spectra E(kx), de-
ﬁned from the 3D spectral energy density E3 as E(kx) =
R R dkydkzE3(kx, ky, kz) and the same for reduced spectra vs ky
or kz. Note that for run A with no expansion and no mean ﬁeld,
all directions should be equivalent; we thus use for all quantities
the average of the three reduced spectra:

E(k) = (1/3)(E(kx) + E(ky) + E(kz))

(14)

To reveal the spectral slopes of the diﬀerent reduced spectra,
we show in ﬁg. 2a the total, residual, magnetic and kinetic ener-
gies averaged during the time interval 10 ≤ t ≤ 12, respectively
compensated by the slopes k−5/3, k−2, k−5/3, k−3/2. The averages
are made on 209 outputs, after expressing (by interpolating on a
ﬁxed grid) the spectra vs the ratio k/kd, where kd is the wavenum-
ber associated with a peak of the instantaneous spectrum of the
current, namely of k2E M(k). Plateaux are seen to develop in the

Fig. 2. Run A. Energy spectra averaged during time interval 10 ≤ t ≤
12. Wavenumbers are normalized by the dissipative wavenumber kd for
which k2EM(k) is maximum, see text. (a) From top to bottom: Total,
residual, magnetic and kinetic energies, compensated resp. by k−5/3,

range 0.1 ≤ k/kd ≤ 1, thus showing good agreement with spec-
tral slopes measured in the solar wind. The same set of slopes has
been found recently in the 2D hybrid simulations by Franci et al.
(2015).

(15)

Fig. 2b allows to assess the Alfvén-dynamo scenario by
showing the residual spectra normalized by the α−model pre-
diction with successively α = 1 and α = 2. More precisely, one
shows
α(k) = ER
eR
where (ER

k is the equilibrium solution eq. 7.

k /(ER
k )α
k )α = (t0

A/tNL)αET

The solid curve shows the normalization by the α = 1 pre-
diction, the dotted curve the normalization by the α = 2 predic-
tion. All spectra vs k/kd are again averaged over the 209 spectra
stored during the time interval 10 ≤ t ≤ 12. One sees that in
the inertial range 0.1 ≤ k/kd ≤ 1, only the α = 1 normalization
shows a plateau, indicating that the α = 1 scenario catches the
basic physics, in agreement with the slopes (mT , mR) = (5/3, 2)
obtained for the total and residual spectra in ﬁg 2a.

A still better quantitative agreement can be obtained if we
use for the stretching time the advection time: tNL = 1/(ku) in-
stead of eq. 4 (that allowed to close the problem). This gives a
measured/predicted ratio closer to unity in the inertial range, as
shown by the dashed curve in ﬁg. 2b.

To give an idea of how the spectra evolve with time, we show
in ﬁg. 3 the evolution of spectral energy density at ﬁve wavenum-
bers: k = 4, 8, 16, 32, for the four quantities: (a) total, (b) resid-
ual, (c) residual energy normalized by α = 1 model, (d) residual
energy normalized by α = 2 model. Total energy is multiplied
by k5/3, residual energy by k2. Total energies at k = 8, 16, 32
are seen to collapse at about t ≥ 7, revealing the formation of
the k−5/3 inertial range. At about the same time, the collapse of
residual energy curves reveal the formation of the k−2 range. The
modes 4 to 32, normalized by the α = 1 model, also show in
panel (c) a nice collapse towards a value close to unity. In con-
strast, modes normalized by the α = 2 model remain signiﬁ-
cantly scattered.

We now consider with run B the 3D MHD equations modiﬁed
by the expansion (EBM, Grappin et al. (1993)). The EBM equa-

tions allow us to follow the evolution of a plasma volume embed-
ded in a uniform, given radial ﬂow with speed U0 as in the solar
wind. The radial ﬂow cannot be eliminated by a plain Galilean
transformation and forces the plasma volume to expand in di-
rections perpendicular to the radial. This leads to many genuine
eﬀects speciﬁc of solar wind turbulence: (i) quadratic invariants
are lost, and replaced by ﬁrst order invariants (as mass, momen-
tum, angular momentum, magnetic ﬂux), (ii) cascade isotropy is
lost, the turbulent cascade being stronger in the radial direction
(Dong et al. 2014). Note that the expansion itself already pro-
vides a large-scale source of magnetic excess, as it selectively
decreases only one component (the radial one) of the magnetic
ﬁeld in Alfvén speed units, and two components of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld (e.g., Zhou & Matthaeus (1990); Oughton & Matthaeus
(1995); Grappin et al. (1993); Dong et al. (2014)).

We consider initially an isotropic 1/k large-scale spectrum in
order to mimic the large-scale fossil 1/ f spectrum observed in
the wind (Bruno & Carbone 2013). The Mach number is ≃ 0.1
as for run A; kinetic velocity and magnetic ﬂuctuations are at
equipartition, and ∇.u=0. The wind expansion rate normalized
to the large scale nonlinear time is initially ǫ = U0L0
= 2,
rmsR0
where L0 is the initial size of the domain (with aspect ratio
unity), and R0 the initial distance. This means that initially most
of the spectral range (that with k ≥ 2) has a nonlinear time
shorter than the local transit time te = R0/U0. This leaves place
for an inertial range to develop, together with speciﬁc spec-
tral anisotropy characteristic of turbulence with expansion (see
Dong et al. (2014); Verdini & Grappin (2015)). Evolution is fol-
lowed from time t = 0 up to t = 3.2 nonlinear times, correspond-
ing to an heliocentric distance increase of R/R0 = 1 + ǫt = 7.4
(also equal to the increase of the aspect ratio of the domain). Dur-
ing this time, relative cross-helicity remains smaller than 0.01.

As observational records by spacecrafts are made along the
radial direction, leading via the Taylor hypothesis to 1D reduced
spectra vs radial wavenumber, we present only such spectra in
Fig. 4, at times t=0.8, 1.2... 3.2. Total energy spectra are shown
compensated by k−5/3 in panel (a), residual spectra are shown
compensated by k−2 in panel (b). On can thus see in panel (a)
the progressive steepening of the total energy spectrum (starting
from the initial 1/k spectrum) towards a k−5/3 range and in panel
(b) the formation of the k−2 range for the residual spectrum. Pan-
els (c) and (d) show residual spectra normalized by respectively
the α = 1 and α = 2 equilibrium spectra (eq. 7). The residual
spectra are seen to converge towards the α = 1 model in the
inertial range, much less so towards the α = 2 model.

Magnetic and kinetic spectra also exhibit (not shown) scal-
ings close to respectively 5/3 and 3/2 but within a wavenumber
range shorter than for previous run A.

4. Discussion
4.1. The α = 1 modelvssimulations/Solarwind

Using both compressible MHD and EBM (i.e., compressible
MHD modiﬁed by expansion) simulations with moderate Mach
number, zero mean ﬁeld, low cross-helicity, we have found that
the α = 1 equilibrium between residual and total energy relation
(eq. 7) holds, with the spectra showing speciﬁcally the slopes
(mT , mR) = (5/3, 2).

We found that in run A the quasi-stationary magnetic spec-
trum scale as k−5/3 and the kinetic spectrum as k−3/2: these
scalings are observed in the solar wind (Podesta et al. 2007;
Salem et al. 2009). This is the ﬁrst report of this set of slopes in
simulations with low cross-correlation in 3D MHD simulations.

vations. (a) Observations (symbols) as taken from ﬁg5b from Chen et al.
(2013) vs cross-helicity σc; solid line: residual slope as predicted from

(−mT , −mR) from observations (squares); straight lines: relation mR(mT )
given in eq. 9 with α = 0 (dashed line), α = 1 (solid), α = 2 (dotted).

Previously, the four spectral slopes had been found in 2D hybrid
simulations by Franci et al. (2015) with the same conditions (no
mean ﬁeld, weak compressibility, low cross-helicity). Also, in-
compressible 3D reduced MHD simulations have been reported
with this set of slopes, but only when forcing with a large cross-
helicity (Boldyrev et al. 2011). It is important to remark that the
incompressible simulations are at variance with our compress-
ible results: with no cross-helicity, these authors report mR = 2
together with mT = 3/2, which is the prediction of the α = 2
model, the one satisﬁed as well by the incompressible MG05
simulations. This will discussed again below.

The scaling relation associated with the α = 1 model (eq. 9):

mR = −1/2 + (3/2)mT

(16)

applies well to the average slopes found in the solar wind: mT ≃
1.7, mR ≃ 2 in the low cross-helicity wind. However, by exam-
ining the data published in Chen et al. (2013) (see their ﬁg. 5b),
we ﬁnd that the agreement is actually more universal than that.
Eq. 16 works actually also for cross-helicities σc larger than 0.6,
for which the total energy spectrum becomes ﬂatter. This is seen
in ﬁg. 5a, in which we reproduce the measured slopes for total
and residual energies vs. σc as in ﬁg.5b of Chen et al. (2013).
The solid line gives the predicted residual slope, replacing in
eq. 16 the total energy slope by its measured value. The agree-
ment is seen to increase in the right part of the ﬁgure for large
cross-helicity, which happens to be the region where error bars
are the smallest (see original ﬁgure).

Fig. 5b summarizes our ﬁndings by showing a scatter plot of
measured slopes (residual slope vs total energy slope) and com-
paring with the predictions of the three models: α = 0 (dashed
line), 1 (solid) and 2 (dotted). This allows to see how far from the
true situation in the wind are, respectively, the isotropic edqnm
model (α = 2) on the one hand, and the simple α = 0 model.

This indicates that the Alfvén-dynamo theory is able to de-
scribe a large interval of turbulent parameters: it works as well
in the balanced and imbalanced regime, with no mean ﬁeld and
with average mean ﬁeld.

Fig. 6. Run A1: return of residual energy to equilibrium after increasing
the magnetic energy by a factor four in run A at time t = 10. 1D reduced
spectra, time evolution of modes k = 8, 16, 32 (resp. solid, dotted and

normalized by the α = 1 solution evaluated at time t = 12; (c) residual
energy, as well as the analytical solution with short damping time (thin
lines, cf. eq. 18 with tD = t0
A); (d) same as (c) but with tD = tNL for the
analytical solution

might rule the Alfvén-dynamo equation (eq. 5), we now consider
the response of the system without expansion (run A) to per-
turbations of the equilibrium residual energy in two successive
experiments.

In both experiments, we restart run A at time t = 10 after
perturbing the residual energy spectrum, and follow the evolu-
tion up to t = 12. In the ﬁrst experiment (run A1), we increase
the residual energy by increasing the magnetic energy by a fac-
tor four at all scales. In the second case (run A2) we decrease
the residual energy to zero by raising the kinetic energy to the
level of magnetic energy in the whole spectral range. Due to this
procedure, the relative cross-helicity is raised to about 0.4, but
stil remains below 0.45 up to the end of the run. The progressive
relaxation of the system towards equilibrium is shown in the two
ﬁgures 6-7. Panels (a) and (b) show respectively the behavior of
modes k = 8, 16, 32 for the total energy compensated by k−5/3
and for the residual energy normalized by the α = 1 equilibrium.
One sees in panels (a) that the three modes of the total energy
remain close together, indicating that the spectral scaling is basi-
cally not modiﬁed by the perturbation. Panels (b) show that the
three modes of the normalized residual spectrum quickly recover
the α = 1 solution in the time lapse 10 − 12. This occurs within
a factor very close to unity in run A1 (ﬁg. 6), and within a factor
≃ 0.8 in run A2 (ﬁg. 7).

Last, we compare the measured numerical relaxation of the
residual energy to the analytical solution of the Alfvén-dynamo
(eq. 5) with α = 1. To this aim, we rewrite eq. 5, replacing the
source term by the equilibrium solution of the α = 1 model:

∂tER(k, t) = (−ER(k, t) + ER

eq(k))/tD

the residual energy to zero by increasing the kinetic energy to the level

with ER
A/tNL)ET (k), and assume the total energy spec-
trum (as well as the caracteristic times t0
A and tNL) to be time-
independent, which is reasonably correct for runs A1 and A2.
In practice, we replace these parameters by their value at time
t = 12: ER
A/tNL)ET (k)]t=12. The model solutions thus
read

eq(k) = [(t0

ER(k, t) = ER(k, 0)e−t/tD + ER

eq(k)(1 − e−t/tD)

(18)

with either tD = t0

A (eq. 11) or tD = tNL (eq. 12).

In panels (c) and (d) we show the model curves (thin lines)
with respectively tD = t0
A and tD = tNL, together with the numer-
ical solutions. The agreement for the three modes k = 8, 16, 32
with the model tD = tNL is clearly much better than with tD = t0
A.
It is perfect for run A1 (ﬁg. 6c), not as good for run A2 (ﬁg. 7),
but still acceptable: the discrepancy is due to the fact that the
new numerical equilibrium solution is a factor 0.8 smaller than
the theoretical equilibrium solution (eq. 7 with α = 1).

After having validated in Section 3 the (α = 1) equilibrium
model, we have now shown that the relaxation time is tD = tNL.
As a consequence, we deduce that the source term in eq. 5 reads
k /tdyn with tdyn = t2
ET
A i.e., has the same form as in the
edqnm solution. In summary, we have proved that the magnetic
excess results from the competition between two terms: (i) a slow
Alfvén damping with time scale equal to a nonlinear time as pre-
dicted by critical balance; (ii) a source term identical to that of
the isotropic dynamo found in Grappin et al. (1983) and MG05.

4.3. Incompressiblevscompressiblesimulations

We ﬁnally come back on the MG05 incompressible simulations,
which we have said to be well described by the α = 2 model,
contrary to our compressible simulations that satisfy the α = 1
model. We reexamined the MG05 simulations and found that
the origin of the discrepancy lies in the method used to build

1D residual energy spectra. In MG05, the spectra ER(k) were
built by averaging the spectral density within spherical shells
(later on “isotropized spectra”). In contrast, in this paper, we
used reduced spectra, either ER(kx) (run B) or averages of the
three reduced spectra (run A). While we expect that choosing re-
duced or isotropized spectra matters for run B because expansion
introduces a true physical anisotropy in the system (the radial
direction becomes a symmetry axis), we expect nothing of the
kind without expansion. Indeed, we found that the choice of the
spectrum (isotropized or reduced) makes no visible diﬀerence in
scalings when dealing with runs A, A1, A2 presented here.

However, by reexamining the incompressible MG05 sim-
ulations, we found a diﬀerent situation: residual spectra (but
not total energy spectra) present diﬀerent slopes, depending on
whether they are reduced or isotropized. Fig. 8 shows spectra for
the incompressible run with no mean ﬁeld considered in MG05
(denoted as run C). Top panels show reduced spectra, bottom
panels show isotropized spectra, both at time t=6.5.

While the total energy spectra show k−5/3 scalings whatever
the spectrum used, the residual reduced and isotropized spec-
tra show diﬀerent scalings (compare panels (a) and (c)). The re-
duced residual spectrum scales as k−2 (as do the compressible
runs analyzed in the present work) while the isotropized residual
spectrum scales as k−7/3, as reported in MG05. This is conﬁrmed
in panels (b) and (d) where we show the residual spectra nor-
malized by the α = 1 (solid lines) and α = 2 (dotted lines) pre-
dictions (eq. 15). The α = 1 model indeed matches the reduced
spectra while the α = 2 model matches the isotropized spec-
trum, at least qualitatively. This clariﬁes the problem, but does
not solve it: it remains that the incompressible simulations are
singular with respect to the measurement of the residual energy
spectrum.

4.4. Physicalinterpretation

Let us come back on the list of diﬀerent time scales in eqs. (10-
13) and forget for a moment that we know which model matches
both our numerical (compressible) simulations and observa-
tional data. Regarding the damping time tD, the Alfvén eﬀect
is clearly at the origin of the damping of the magnetic excess.
However, adopting the isotropized Alfvén time tD = t0
A would
contradict common wisdom that most of the energy lies in di-
rections perpendicular to the local mean ﬁeld (Biskamp 2003).
Indeed, for the majority of modes at a given scale 1/k, the ef-
fective damping time is not equal to t0
A = 1/(kb0) but instead
to 1/(kkb0), which, by virtue of the so-called critical balance
(Goldreich & Sridhar 1995), is about equal to the nonlinear time
tNL: this yields tD = tNL. Now let us consider the dynamo time:
the simplest choice is clearly tdyn = tNL (Gogoberidze et al.
k = Etot
2012); but since tD = tNL, this would imply that ER
k ,
in contradiction with solar wind observations and our numerical
evidence.

In contrast, the remaining alternative, tdyn = t2

A, (together
with tD = tNL) matches our numerical data, and observations.
Thus, the dynamo process responsible for the emergence and
sustainment of the observed magnetic excess ( ∼ ET /(t2
A))
is not straightforwardly connected with the energy cascade (∼
ET /tNL), as it proceeds on a time scale much longer than the
nonlinear time. This is not contradictory to what is known about
the dynamo process, which also relies on a (long time) inverse
cascade of magnetic helicity. However, this gives a prominent
role to the isotropized Alfvén time, in contradiction with the crit-
ical balance between the eﬀective Alfvén time and the nonlinear
time. We have presently no solution for this paradox, as well
as for the sensitivity, in incompressible solutions, of the resid-
ual spectrum to the deﬁnition of the spectrum (isotropized or
reduced).

Other attempts to introduce anisotropy into the edqnm equa-
tion have made the a priori assumption that the source of the
residual spectrum has the same structure as that of the total
energy spectrum (Boldyrev et al. 2012). But, again, when ap-
plied to our case with no mean ﬁeld, this assumption immedi-
ately leads to the invalid α = 0 prediction for which mR = mT ,
ER
k = ET
k .

Several questions remain to be solved and are postponed to
future work: (i) why incompressible simulations adopt a singular
behavior, (ii) what is the origin of the long time scale tdyn of the
local dynamo (eq. 12).
