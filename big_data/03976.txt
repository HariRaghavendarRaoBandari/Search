Abstract

We prove the existence of a weak solution to a non-isothermal compressible model for nematic
liquid crystals. An initial-boundary value problem is studied in a bounded domain with large
data. The existence of a global weak solution is established through a three-level approximation,
energy estimates, and weak convergence for the adiabatic exponent γ > 3
2 .

Keywords: weak solutions; compressible non-isothermal model; nematic liquid crystals.

1 Introduction

The evolution of liquid crystals in Ω ⊂ R3 is described by the following system

∂t(ρ) + div(ρu) = 0,

∂t(ρu) + div(ρu ⊗ u) + ∇P (ρ, θ) = divS − νdiv(∇d ⊙ ∇d − (
∂t(ρθ) + div(ρθu) + divq = S : ∇u − Rρθdivu + |∆d − f (d)|2,
∂td + u · ∇d = κ(∆d − f (d)), |d| = 1,

2|∇d|2 + F (d))I),

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

(1.1c)

(1.1d)

where the functions ρ, u, θ and d represent the mass density,the velocity ﬁeld, the absolute temper-
ature and the unit vector ﬁeld that represents the macroscopic molecular orientation of the liquid
crystal material. P stands for the pressure, S denotes the viscous stress tensor. The positive con-
stants ν, κ denote the competition between kinetic energy and potential energy, and microscopic
elastic relation time for the molecular orientation ﬁeld, respectively. ∇d ⊙ ∇d denotes the 3 × 3
matrix whose ijth entry is < ∂xid, ∂xj d >. The vector-valued smooth function f(d) denotes the
penalty function and has the following form:

f (d) = ∇dF (d),

(1.2)

B.L.Guo,B.Q.Xie, X.Y.Xi

where the scalar function F (d) is the bulk part of the elastic energy. A typical example is choose
F(d) as the Ginzburg-Landau penalization thus yielding the penalty function f(d) as:

F (d) =

1
4σ2
0

(|d|2 − 1)2, f (d) =

1
2σ2
0

(|d|2 − 1)d,

where σ0 > 0 is a constant.

Our analysis is based on the following physically grounded assumptions:
[A1]The viacous stress tensor S is determined by the Newton’s rheological law

where µ and λ are respectively the shear and bulk constant viscosity coeﬃcients satisfying

S = µ(∇xu + ∇⊥

x u) + λdivxuI,

µ > 0, λ +

2
3

µ ≥ 0.

[A2]The internal pressure obeys the following equation of state:

P (ρ, θ) = ργ + Rρθ,

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

where R is the perfect gas constant. The ﬁrst term describes the elastic pressure while the latter
term represents the thermodynamic pressure for ideal gas given by Boyle’s law.

[A3]The internal energy ﬂux q is expressed through Fourier’s law:

A key element of the system (1.1) is the heat conducting coeﬃcient κ which is a continuous function
of temperature and satisﬁes the following growth condition:

q = −κ(θ)∇θ, κ ≥ 0,

(1.6)

κ0(1 + θα) ≤ κ(ρ, θ) ≤ κ0(1 + θα),

where κ0, κ0, α are positive constants and α ≥ 2.

To complete the system (1.1), the boundary conditions are given by

Of course, we also need to assume the initial conditions

u|∂Ω = ∇θ · n|∂Ω = ∇d · n|∂Ω = 0.

ρ(0,·) = ρ0, (ρu)(0,·) = m0, θ(0,·) = θ0, d(0,·) = d0.

together with the compatibility condition:

m0 = 0 on the set {x ∈ Ω|ρ0(x) = 0}.

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

(1.10)

The purpose of this paper is to establish the global existence of weak solutions to this ini-
tial boundary value problem with large initial data. To our best knowledge, the only available
existence results for non-isothermal model concern the incompressible case(for instance Feireisl-
Rocca-Schimperna [2],[3] and the references therein), they proved global existence of weak solutions
to the non-isothermal system with penalty term f(d). Compared with the system with the penalty
term f (d), system with term |∇d|2d was studied by J.K.Li and Z.P.Xin [5]. The isothermal case

2

Global existence weak solutions to compressible non-isothermal models for nematic liquid crystals

with the incompressible condition was proposed by Lin in [8] and later analyzed by Lin-Liu in
[9]. The model proposed in [9],[8] is a considerably simpliﬁed version of the famous Leslie-Ericksen
model introduced by Ericksen [6] and Leslie [7] in the 1960’s. But the regularity and uniqueness
of weak solutions is still open, at least for three dimensional case, see Li-Liu [10] for the regular-
ity results. When the density of the liquid crystals is taken account, the global existence of weak
solutions can be obtained in the framework of [12],[11],[4], see Jiang-Tan [13] and Liu-Zhang [14]
for the incompressible model, see Wang-Yu [1] for the compressible model. Therefore, we want to
prove the global existence of weak solution to a simpliﬁed non-isothermal compressible model for
nematic liquid crystals.

Now, we give the deﬁnition of a varational solution to (1.1)-(1.10).

Deﬁnition 1.1. We call (ρ, u, θ, d) is as a varational weak solution to the problem (1.1)-(1.10), if

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we deduce a priori estimates from (1.1). In
section 3, we establish the global existence of solutions to the Faedo-Galerkin approximation to
(1.1). In section 4 and 5, we use the uniform estimates to recover the original system by vanishing
the artiﬁcial viscosity and artiﬁcial pressure respectively, therefore the main theorem is proved by
using the weak convergence method in the framework of Firesel [4].

2 A priori bounds

In this section, we collect the available a priori estimates. For the sake of simplicity, we set
ν = κ = 1. Firstly we formally derive the energy equality and some a priori estimates, which will
paly a very important role in our paper. Multiplying the equation (1.1b) by u, integrating over Ω,
and using the boundary condition, we obtain

thus we obtain the total energy conservation. Assume the initial total energy is ﬁnite, we immedi-
ately obtain the following bounds:

k√ρukL∞(0,T ;L2(Ω)) ≤ C,kρkL∞(0,T ;Lγ(Ω)) ≤ C,

kρθkL∞(0,T ;L1(Ω)) ≤ C,

(2.8)

(2.9)

Next, we will deduce the entropy estimates. We replaced the thermal energy equation (1.1c)

with the entropy equation:

θ(∂t(ρs) + div(ρsu)) = div(κ(θ)∇θ) + S : ∇u + |∆d − f (d)|2,

where

It is not hard to see that the density dependent part of the entropy is dominated by the elastic part
of the internal energy:

|ρ log ρ| ≤ C(1 + ργ) ≤ C, f or a certain C > 0.

Moreover, we have

Consequently, relation (2.9) entails

For the proof of this lemma, we refer to book [4].
Combining the conclusion of Lemma 2.1 and the estimates (2.13) we get

and

Now, we can integrate the forth equation in (1.1) to obtain

(2.19)

(2.21)

(2.22)

One can use the estimates (2.16) together with the Sobolev imbedding theorem to conclude that

Z T
0 ZΩ |Rρθ|2dxdt ≤ C,

Here we require α > 2γ

3(γ−2) .

In accordance with hypothesis (1.3) , the relation (2.18), (2.20) give rise to the estimate

and

k∇ukL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C,

k∆d − f (d)kL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C,

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

To control the strongly nonlinear terms containing ∇d, we need more regularity for the direction

ﬁeld d. To deal with this obstacle, we have the following lemma:

Lemma 2.2. If there exists a constant C0 > 0 such that d · f (d) ≥ 0 for all |d| ≥ C0 > 0, then
d ∈ L∞((0, T ) × Ω) and ∇d ∈ L4((0, T ) × Ω).

For the proof of this lemma, we refer to paper [1].
As for regular solutions the temperature is always positive, we are allowed to multiply the

thermal energy equation by θ−ω, 0 < ω ≤ 1. By parts integration yields

3 The approximation system

In this section we introduce a three level approximating scheme which involves a system of regular-
ized equations. The approximation scheme reads:

∂t(ρ) + div(ρu) = ε∆ρ,

∂t(ρu) + div(ρu ⊗ u) + ∇P (ρ, θ) + δ∇ρβ + ε∇u · ∇ρ
= divS − νdiv(∇d ⊙ ∇d − (

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

∂t((δ + ρ)θ) + div(ρθu) − ∆K(θ) + δθα+1 = (1 − δ)S : ∇u − Rρθdivu + |∆d − f (d)|2,

(3.1c)

with boundary conditions

∂td + u · ∇d = ∆d − f (d), |d| = 1,

together with initial data

∇ρ · n|∂Ω = 0,
u|∂Ω = 0,
∇θ · n|∂Ω = 0,
d|∂Ω = d0,

ρ|t=0 = ρ0,δ(x),
ρu|t=0 = m0,δ(x),
(δ + ρ)θ|t=0 = (δ + ρ0,δ(x))θ0,δ(x),
d|t=0 = d0,δ(x),

Here the initial data ρ0,δ ∈ C 2+ν(Ω), ν > 0, satisﬁes the following conditions:

0 < δ ≤ ρ0,δ(x) ≤ δ− 1

2β ,

and

ρ0,δ → ρ0 in Lγ(Ω), |{ρ0,δ < ρ0}| → 0 as δ → 0,

Moreover, the initial momenta m0,δ are deﬁned as

m0,δ(x) =( m0,
Further, the function θ0,δ ∈ C 2+ν(Ω) satisfy

0,

if ρ0,δ(x) ≥ ρ0(x),
if ρ0,δ(x) < ρ0(x).

0 < θ ≤ θ0,δ ≤ θ, f or all x ∈ Ω, δ > 0, ∇θ0,δ · n|∂Ω = 0.

3.1. Faedo-Galerkin method

The initial boundary value (3.1)-(3.7) will be solved via a modiﬁed Faedo-Galerkin method. Firstly,
we introduce the ﬁnite-dimensional space endowed with the L2 Hibert space structure:

Xn = span{ηi}n

i=1, n ∈ 1, 2, ...,

(3.8)

0 (Ω, R3).
where the linearly independent functions ηi ∈ D(Ω)3, i=1,2,..., form a dense subset in C 2
The approximation solution un ∈ C([0, T ]; Xn) satisfy a set of integral equation of the following
form :

m0,δ · ηdx

ρun(τ ) · ηdx −ZΩ
ZΩ

0 ZΩ

(divSn − div(ρun ⊗ un) − ∇(P (ρ) + δ∇ρβ) − ε∇un · ∇ρ) · ηdxdt
νdiv(∇d ⊙ ∇d − (

1
2|∇d|2 + F (d))I) · ηdxdt,

(3.9)

Then the density ρn = ρ[un] is determined uniquely as the solution of the following Neumann initial-
boundary value problem (3.1a), (3.2a), (3.3a). The detail of this proof can be seen in their book [4]
Lemma7.1 and 7.2 . The director ﬁeld dn = d[un] is the unique solution of (3.1d), (3.2d), (3.3d),
the proof of this result can refer to Lemma 3.1 and 3.2 in [1]. At the same time, θn = θ[ρn, un, dn]
is the unique solution of (3.1c), (3.2c), (3.3c), the proof of this result can refer to Lemma 7.3 and
7.4 in [4]. Furthermore, the problem (3.9) can be solved at least on a short time interval (0, Tn)
with Tn ≤ T by a standard ﬁxed point theorem on the Banach space C([0, T ]; Xn). We refer to [4]
for more details. Thus we obtain a local solution (ρn, un, dn, θn) in time.

To obtain uniform bounds on un, we derive an energy inequality similar to (2.5) as follows.
Taking η = un(t, x) with ﬁxed t in (3.1b) and repeating the procedure for a priori estimates in
Section 2, we deduce a total energy inequality :

From (3.10) we deduce that

un is bounded in L2(0, T ; W 1,2

0

(Ω)),

(3.11)

by a constant that is independent of n and T (n) ≤ T . Since all norms are equivalent on Xn,
this implies that the approximate velocity ﬁelds un are bounded in L1(0, T ; W 1,∞(Ω)), then we
know that the density ρn is bounded both from below and from above by a constant independent
of T (n) ≤ T . Consequently, the functions un remain bounded in Xn for any t independently of
T (n) ≤ T . These uniform estimates can extend the local solution un to the whole time interval
[0,T]. Thus, we obtain the function (ρn, dn, θn) on the whole time interval [0,T].

3.2. First level of approximate solutions

The next step is to pass to the limit as n → ∞ in the sequence of approximate solutions {ρn, un, dn, θn}.
In order to achieve this, additional estimates are needed.

To begin with, by following a similar argument to Ferreisl [4], we get

By the energy estimate (3.10), we have

ρn → ρ in Lβ((0, T ) × Ω).

un → u weakly L2(0, T ; W 1,2

where ρ, u satisfy equation (3.1a) together with boundary conditions (3.2a) and the initial condition
holds in the sense of distribution.

At this stage of approximation, the absolute temperature θn is strictly positive, and, conse-

quently, equation (3.1d) can be rewritten as follows

∂t((δ + ρn)H(θn)) + div(ρnH(θn)un) − ∆Kh(θ) + δθα+1
= (1 − δ)h(θn)Sn : ∇un − κ(θn)h′(θn)|∇θn|2 − Rθnh(θn)ρndivun

where we have used hypothesis (1.7). It follows from the energy estimates (3.10) that the right-hand
side of the last inequality is bounded in L1(0, T ) by a constant that depends only on δ.

Global existence weak solutions to compressible non-isothermal models for nematic liquid crystals

Consequently, (3.14) integrated with respect to t together with the energy estimates yields a

bound

By virtue of (3.18), we have

k∇θα/2

n kL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C,

θn → θ in L2(0, T ; W 1,2(Ω)).

Moreover, relation (3.10),(3.19) yield

(3.20)

Next, we will use the following variant Lions-Aubin Lemma:

Lemma 3.1. Let vn be a sequence of functions such that Lq1(0, T ; Lq2(Ω)), where 1 ≤ p1, p2 ≤ ∞
and

{vn}∞

n=1 is bounded in L2(0, T ; Lq(Ω)) ∩ L∞(0, T ; L1(Ω)) with q > 2n/(n + 2),

(3.21)

Let us assume in addition that

∂tvn ≥ χn in D′((0, T ) × Ω),

(3.22)

where

χn are bounded in L1(0, T ; W −m,r(Ω))

for a certain m ≥ 1, r > 1. Then {vn}∞

n=1 contains a subsequence such that

vn → v in L2(0, T ; W −1,2(Ω)).

Since θn satisfy the renormalized thermal energy (3.12), we can apply Lemma 3.1 together (3.20)

to obtain

Relation (3.19) and (3.23) imply

(ρn + δ)θn → (ρ + δ)θ in L2(0, T ; W −1,2(Ω)).

(ρn + δ)θnθn → (ρ + δ)θθ weakly in L1((0, T ) × Ω).

On the other hand, utilizing (3.10), (3.19) again, we get

(ρε + δ)θnθn → (ρ + δ)θθ weakly in L1((0, T ) × Ω).

which compared with (3.24), yields

θ2 = θ2.

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

Therefore it is easy to see that (3.26) implies strong convergence θn in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)).

Now we integrating the equation (3.1c) over space-time, get

B.L.Guo,B.Q.Xie, X.Y.Xi

Due to the estimate (3.18), we know the right hand of above inequality are bounded. Thus we have

and

k∇unkL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C,

k∆dn − f (dn)kL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C,

Following the procedure in section 2, we conclude that

This yields that

and

dn ∈ L∞([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).

∆dn − f (dn) → ∆d − f (d) weakly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)).

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

(3.32)
We now apply the Aubin-Lions lemma to obtain the convergence of dn and ∇dn. From Lemma2.1

dn → d weakly in L∞([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).

in [4], we have

and

Using the equation (3.1d), we have

dn ∈ L∞((0, T ) × Ω).

∇dn ∈ L4((0, T ) × Ω).

where we used embedding inequality; the values of C are variant. Thus, (3.28), (3.29) and (3.34)
yield

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

Summing up to the previous results, by taking a subsequence if necessary, we can assume that:

k∂tdnkL2((0,T )×Ω) ≤ C.

Now, we consider the convergence of the terms relate to dn and ∇dn. Let φ be a test function, then

weak(Ω)),

dn → d in C([0, T ]; L2
dn → d weakly in L∞([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)),
dn → d strongly in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω))
∇dn → ∇d weakly in L4((0, T ) × Ω),
∆dn − f (dn) → ∆d − f (d) weakly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)),
F (dn) → F (d) strongly in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)).

12

Global existence weak solutions to compressible non-isothermal models for nematic liquid crystals

By the strong convergence of ∇dn in L2(Ω) , we conclude that

Similarly,

∇dn ⊙ ∇dn → ∇d ⊙ ∇d in D′(Ω × (0, T )).

0 (Ω)).

Therefore, (3.1d) and (3.9) hold at least in the sense of distribution. Moreover, by the uniform
estimates on u, d and (3.1d), we know that the map

t →ZΩ

dn(x, t)φ(x)dx f or any φ ∈ D(Ω),

is equi-continuous on [0,T]. By the Ascoli-Arzela Theorem, we know that

t →ZΩ

dn(x, t)φ(x)dx,

is continuous for any φ ∈ D(Ω). Thus, d satisﬁes the initial condition in (3.1d).

Now, multiplying (3.12) by a test function φ, φ ∈ C 2([0, T ] × Ω), φ ≥ 0, φ(T,·) = 0,∇φ · n = 0

we obtain,

(3.39)

Now we have the existence of a global solution to (3.1)-(3.3) as follows:

Proposition 3.2. Assume that Ω ⊂ R3 is a bounded domain of the class C 2+ν, ν > 0; and there
exists a constant C0 > 0, such that d · f (d) ≥ 0 for all |d| ≥ C0 > 0. Let ε > 0, δ > 0, and
β > max{4, γ} be ﬁxed. Then for any given T > 0, there is a solution (ρ, u, d) to the initial-
boundary value problem of (3.1)-(3.3) in the following sense:

(1) The density ρ is a nonnegative function such that

ρ ∈ Lγ([0, T ]; W 2,r(Ω)), ∂tρ, ∆ρ ∈ Lγ((0, T ) × Ω),

for some r > 1, the velocity u ∈ L2([0, T ]; H 1
0 (Ω)), and (3.1a) holds almost everywhere on (0, T )×Ω,
and the initial and boundary data on ρ are satisﬁed in the sense of traces. Moreover, the total mass
is conserved, that is

ρ(x, t)dx =ZΩ
for all t ∈ [0, T ]; and the following inequalities hold

ZΩ

ρδ,0dx,

ρβ+1dxdt ≤ C(ε, δ),

Z T
0 ZΩ
εZ T
0 ZΩ |∇ρ|2dxdt ≤ C with C independent of ε.

(3.40)

(2) The modiﬁed momentum equation (3.1b) is satisﬁed in D′((0, T ) × Ω). Moreover,

ρu ∈ C([0, T ]; L2γ/(γ+1)

weak

(Ω)),

satisﬁed the initial conditions (3.3b).

(3) The energy inequality (3.39) holds for any function, φ ∈ C ∞[0, T ], φ(0) = 1, φ(T ) = 0, ∂tφ ≤

0.

(4) All terms in (3.1c) are locally integrable on (0, T )× Ω. The direction d satisﬁes the equation

(3.1c) and the initial data (3.3c) in the sense of distribution.

(5) The temperature θ is a non-negative function,

θ ∈ Lα+1((0, T ) × Ω), θα/2 ∈ L2(0, T ; W 1,2(Ω)),

satisﬁed the renormalized thermal energy inequality (3.38).

4 Vanishing artiﬁcial viscosity

Our next goal is to let the artiﬁcial viscosity ε → 0 in the approximating system (3.1)-(3.3). Here
we denote by ρε, uε, θε the corresponding solution of the approximate problems (3.1)-(3.3) whose
existence of which was stated in proposition 3.2, we point out that at this stage the boundedness of
∇ρε is no longer hold and , consequently, strong convergence of the sequence {ρε}ε>0 in L1((0, T )×Ω)
becomes a central issue.

4.1. Pressure and temperature estimates

In order to avoid concentrations in the pressure term, we have to ﬁnd a bound in a reﬂexive space
Lp((0, T ) × Ω), with p > 1, independent of ε. Note that the estimate of this type can be deduced
via the multiplier of the form

ψB[ρε −

1
Ω

ρεdx], ψ ∈ D(0, T ),

in the regularized momentum equation (3.1b). Here, the symbol B ≈ div−1 stands for the so-called
Bogovskii operator-a suitable branch of solutions to the problem

divB[h] = h,B[h]|∂Ω = 0,ZΩ

hdx = 0.

Similarly to Section 5 of [1], such a procedure yields an estimate

Lemma 4.1. There is a constant C such that

(ργ

As far as the temperature is concerned, it is suﬃcient to set

α+1−ω

dε → d stongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)),

(4.5)

(4.6)

Consequently, letting ε → 0 and making use of (4.1)-(4.6), we conclude that the limit (ρε, uε, θε, dε)

satisﬁes the following system:

∂t(ρ) + div(ρu) = 0,

∂t(ρu) + div(ρu ⊗ u) + ∇P = divS − νdiv(∇d ⊙ ∇d − (
∂t(ρθ) + div(ρθu) + divq = S : ∇u − Rρθdivu + |∆d − f (d)|2,

(4.7)

where P = ργ + Rρθ + δρβ, here K(x) stands for a weak limit of {Kε}.

4.3. the strong convergence of density

We observe that ρε, uε is a strong solution of parabolic equation (3.1a), then the renormalized form
can be written as

∂tb(ρε) + div(b(ρε)uε) + (b′ρε − b(ρε))divuε
= εdiv(χΩ∇b(ρε)) − εχΩb′′(ρε)|∇ρε|2,

(4.8)

in D′((0, T ) × R3), with b ∈ C 2[0,∞), b(0) = 0, and b′, b′′ bounded functions and b convex, where
χΩ is the characteristics function of Ω. By virtue of (4.8) and the convexity of b, we have

b(ρ0,δ)dx +Z T
0 ZΩ

∂tψb(ρε)dxdt,

for any ψ ∈ C ∞[0, T ], 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1, ψ(0) = 1, ψ(T ) = 0. Taking b(z) = z log z gives us the following

Meanwhile, (ρ, u) satisﬁes

for all most everywhere τ ∈ [0, T ].

To obtain the strong convergence of density ρε, the crucial point is to get the weak continuity

of the viscous pressure, namely:

then

ZΩ

µZ T
0 ZΩ

(P ρ − ργ + δρβ+1),

and

Due to the convexity of ργ + δρβ. So

P ρ − ργ + δρβ+1 ≤ 0,

On the other hand,

ZΩ

ρ log ρ − ρ log ρdx ≤ 0,

ρ log ρ − ρ log ρ ≥ 0,

Consequently ρ log ρ = ρ log ρ that means

Thus, we can pass to the limit as ε → 0 to obtain the following result:

ρε → ρ,

in L1((0, T ) × Ω).

Proposition 4.3. Assume that Ω ⊂ R3 is a bounded domain of the class C 2+ν, ν > 0; and there
exists a constant C0 > 0, such that d · f (d) ≥ 0 for all |d| ≥ C0 > 0. Let ε > 0, δ > 0, and
β > max{4, γ} be ﬁxed. Then for any given T > 0, there is a solution (ρ, u, d) to the initial-

The objective of this section is to recover the original system by vanishing the parameter δ. Denote

5.2. Reﬁned temperature and pressure estimates
Following the arguments of Chapter 7 in [4], we can derive the estimate of θδ in the space Lα+1((0, T )×
Ω) . The main idea is the same as in [4], that means, we use the quantity

ψ(t, x) = φ(t)(η − η), 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1, φ ∈ D(0, T ),

where η is the following of the Neumann problem

1
∆η = b(ρδ) −
|Ω|
∇η · n|∂Ω = 0, ZΩ

b(ρδ)dx in Ω,

ηdx = 0.

with a suitable chosen function b, as a test function in the thermal energy inequality (4.15). Fol-
lowing step by step the proof in Section 7.5.2 of [4], we infer that

θδ

in bounded in Lα+1((0, T ) × Ω).

Next, pursuing the approach of previous section, we deduce the estimate

Z T
0 ZΩ

5.3. The Limit Passage

By the energy estimate, we get

δρβ

δ → 0 in L1((0, T ) × Ω) as δ → 0,

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

Consequently, Letting δ → 0 in (4.7) and making use of (5.1)-(5.13), the limit of (ρδ, uδ, θδ, dδ)

satisﬁes the following system:



where P = ργ + Rρθ.

∂t(ρ) + div(ρu) = 0,

∂t(ρu) + div(ρu ⊗ u) + ∇P = divS − νdiv(∇d ⊙ ∇d − (
∂td + u · ∇d = ∆d − f (d), |d| = 1,

5.4. the strong convergence of density

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.2, we will need to show the strong convergence of ρδ
in L1(Ω), or, equivalently ργ + Rρθ = ργ + Rρθ.

Since ρδ, uδ is a renormalized solution of the continuity equation (5.14) in D′((0, T ) × R3), we

have

Tk(ρδ)t + div(Tk(ρδ)uδ) + (T ′

k(ρδ)ρδ − Tk(ρδ))div(uδ) = 0 in D′((0, T ) × R3),

20

Global existence weak solutions to compressible non-isothermal models for nematic liquid crystals

where Tk(z) = kT ( z

k ) for z ∈ R, k=1,2,3... and T ∈ C ∞(R) is chosen so that
T (z) = z f or z ≤ 1, T (z) = 2 f or z ≥ 3, T convex.

Passing to the limit for δ → 0 we deduce that

Tk(ρ)t + div(Tk(ρ)u) + (T ′

k(ρ)ρ − Tk(ρ))divu = 0 in D′((0, T ) × R3),

where

and

(T ′

k(ρδ)ρδ − Tk(ρδ))div(uδ) → (T ′

k(ρ)ρ − Tk(ρ))divu weakly in L2((0, T ) × Ω),

Tk(ρδ) → Tk(ρ) in C([0, T ]; Lp

weak(Ω)), f or all 1 ≤ p < ∞.

using the function

ϕ(t, x) = ψη(x)Ai[Tk(ρδ)], ψ ∈ D[0, T ], η ∈ (Ω),

as a test function for momentum equation in (4.7), by a similar calculation to the previous sections,
we can deduce the following result:

Lemma 5.1. Let (ρδ, uδ) be the sequence of approximate solutions constructed in Proposition 4.3,
then

ψη(ργ

δ − divuδ)ρδdxdt

lim

δ→0Z T
0 ZΩ
=Z T
0 ZΩ

ψη(P − divu)ρdxdt f or any ψ ∈ D(0, T ), η ∈ D(Ω),

where P = ργ + Rρθ.

In order to get the strong convergence of ρδ, we need to deﬁne the oscillation defect measure as

follows:

Lemma 5.2. There exists a constant C independent of k such that

for any k ≥ 1.

OSCγ+1[ρδ → ρ]((0, T ) × Ω) ≤ C

We are now ready to show the strong convergence of the density. To this end, we introduce a

sequence of functions Lk ∈ C 1(R):

Lk(z) =


Noting that Lk can be written as

z ln z, 0 ≤ z < k
z ln(k) + zZ z

k

Tk(z)
s2 ds, z ≥ k.

We deduce that

Lk(z) = βkz + bkz,

∂tLk(ρδ) + div(Lk(ρδ)uδ) + Tk(ρδ)divuδ = 0,

(5.15)

21

B.L.Guo,B.Q.Xie, X.Y.Xi

and

∂tLk(ρ) + div(Lk(ρ)u) + Tk(ρ)divu = 0,

(5.16)

in D′((0, T ) × Ω). Letting δ → 0, we can assume that

Lk(ρδ) → Lk(ρ) in C([0, T ]; Lγ

weak(Ω)).

Taking the diﬀerence of (5.15) and (5.16), and integrating with respect to time t, we obtain

ZΩ
(Lk(ρδ) − Lk(ρ))φdx
=Z T
0 ZΩ

(Lk(ρδ)uδ − Lk(ρ)u) · ∇φ + (Tk(ρ)divu − Tk(ρδ)divuδφ)dxdt,

for any φ ∈ D(Ω). Following the line of argument in [1], we get

ZΩ
(Lk(ρ) − Lk(ρ))φdx
=Z T
0 ZΩ

Tk(ρ)divudxdt − lim

δ→0+Z T
0 ZΩ

Tk(ρδ)divuδφ)dxdt,

(5.17)

(5.18)

We observe that the term Lk(ρ) − Lk(ρ) is bounded by its deﬁnition. Using Lemmas 5.2 and the
monotonicity of the pressure, we can estimate the right-hand side of (5.18)

Z T
0 ZΩ
Tk(ρ)divudxdt − lim
≤Z T
0 ZΩ

δ→0+Z T
0 ZΩ
(Lk(ρ) − Lk(ρ))divudxdt,

Tk(ρδ)divuδφ)dxdt

(5.19)

By virtue of Lemma 5.2, the right-hand side of (5.19) tends to zero as k → ∞. So we conclude that

ρ log ρ(t) = ρ log ρ(t),

as k → ∞. Thus we obtain the strong convergence of ρδ in L1((0, T ) × Ω).

Therefore we complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.
