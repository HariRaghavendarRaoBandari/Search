ABSTRACT

As the closest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades is an important benchmark for many stellar
properties, but its members are also scattered widely over the sky. Previous studies of stellar rotation
in the Hyades relied on targeted observations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability
surveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the ﬁrst opportunity to measure rotation periods
(Prot) for many Hyads simultaneously while also being sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members.
We analyze K2 data for 65 Hyads and present Prot values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new
measurements, including the ﬁrst Prot measurements for fully convective Hyads. For nine of the 11
stars with Prot in the literature and this work, the measurements are consistent; we attribute the

indicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection. When conﬁrmed and
candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane, only three rapid rotators with masses
∼0.3 M⊙ remain. This is in contrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period

sequence for ≈600 Myr-old stars ends at ≈0.65 M⊙ when binaries are included. We also ﬁnd that
models of rotational evolution predict faster rotation than is actually observed at ≈600 Myrs for stars

braking is more eﬃcient than previously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for
multiplicity.

1. INTRODUCTION

As the nearest open cluster to the Sun (≈47 pc; van
Leeuwen 2009), the Hyades is a benchmark for under-
standing stellar properties. Many brighter Hyads were
targeted by Hipparcos (Perryman et al. 1997, 1998), al-
lowing for precise astrometric and absolute photometric
calibration. The cluster has also been surveyed for bi-
nary stars (e.g., Griﬃn et al. 1988; Patience et al. 1998;
Reid & Mahoney 2000; Duchêne et al. 2013) and for plan-
ets (e.g., Cochran et al. 2002; Paulson et al. 2004; Quinn
et al. 2014). Hyads have been used to test stellar models
(e.g., Castellani et al. 2001) and to calibrate gyrochronol-
ogy and metallicity scales (e.g., Skumanich 1972; Barnes
2003; Paulson et al. 2003; Delorme et al. 2011).

The Hyades’s age also contributes to its benchmark
status: at 625±50 Myr (Perryman et al. 1998), it is
the oldest nearby open cluster.8 The cluster’s canonical
age, however, has been called into question by Brandt
& Huang (2015a,b), who ﬁt rotating stellar models to

thought, then the stellar evolution scales that it anchors,
including gyrochronology, will need to be re-calibrated.

Ground-based observations designed to measure rota-
tion periods (Prot) typically have small ﬁelds-of-view
∼1 deg2), which would prevent them from obtaining
( <
light curves for more than one or two Hyads at a time.
Previous campaigns to measure Prot in the Hyades have
therefore been limited to observations of individual tar-
gets (Radick et al. 1987, 1995; Prosser et al. 1995) or to
shallower large-area surveys designed to discover tran-
siting exoplanets or other transients (e.g., SuperWASP
and HATNet; Delorme et al. 2011; Hartman et al. 2011).
These surveys have generally focused on solar-type stars
(0.7 − 1.2 M⊙), with almost no sensitivity to fully con-
vective stars ( <

∼0.3 M⊙).

After the second of its four reaction wheels failed,
the Kepler spacecraft could no longer maintain point-
ing toward its original ﬁeld. However, by observing in
the ecliptic, stable pointing can be maintained using the
two functioning reaction wheels to balance the torque on
the spacecraft due to sunlight. The K2 mission (How-
ell et al. 2014) stares at ﬁelds of view along the ecliptic,
observing each for approximately 80 days. The Hyades
was targeted in K2’s Campaign 4, and the spacecraft’s

≈100 deg2 ﬁeld-of-view provided an unprecedented op-
portunity to measure Prot for a large number of Hyads.
Light curves were obtained simultaneously for 65 Hyads,
and Kepler’s sensitivity enabled the ﬁrst assembly of light
curves for fully convective Hyads.

We present the results of our analysis of these K2 data,
including the ﬁrst measurements of Prot for fully con-
vective Hyads.10 We describe the existing data used in
our study, including membership catalogs, photometry,
archival Prot, and studies of multiplicity, in Section 2.
We present our mass measurements in Section 3 and our
K2 data analysis in Section 4. Our results are in Sec-
tion 5, and we discuss their potential implications for
gyrochronology in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7.

2. ARCHIVAL DATA

2.1. Membership

We draw Hyades members primarily from the Gold-
man et al. (2013) catalog, which is an updated version
of the Röser et al. (2011) catalog used in Douglas et al.
(2014, hereafter D14). Goldman et al. (2013) and Röser
et al. (2011) identiﬁed candidate Hyads via the conver-
gent point method and conﬁrmed their membership using
photometry: Röser et al. (2011) combined J HK data
from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrut-
skie et al. 2006) with r′ photometry from the Carlsberg
Meridian Catalogue 14 (CMC14; Copenhagen University
et al. 2006).

Goldman et al. (2013) added ugriz photometry from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8
(Aihara et al. 2011), gP 1rP 1iP 1zP 1yP 1 photometry from
Pan-STARRS 1 (Kaiser et al. 2002; Tonry et al. 2012),
and data from all four bands from the Wide-ﬁeld In-
frared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010). The
Pan-STARRS 1 and WISE data allow these authors to
extend the cluster’s membership to the stellar/sub-stellar
boundary. Goldman et al. (2013) also reject 13 stars that
were identiﬁed as Hyads by Röser et al. (2011) and add
62 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The ﬁnal Goldman
et al. (2013) catalog contains 773 members.

Röser et al. (2011) estimate contamination to their cat-
alog based on distance from the cluster center (dc): it is
1% for stars with dc ≤ 9 pc, 7.5% for 9 < dc ≤ 18 pc, and
30% for 18 < dc ≤ 30 pc. In D14, we converted these
percentages to membership probabilities, Pmem, by sub-
tracting the contamination percentage from 100%.

Goldman et al. (2013) simulate ﬁeld star contamina-
tion as a function of dc and absolute K magnitudes (MK)
but do not give their full results, stating only that the
contamination is <10% for dc ≤ 18 pc, ≤17% for stars
with 18 < dc ≤ 30 pc and 7.5 < MK < 9.5 mag, and
≤30% for dc ≤ 30 pc and MK = 9. These contam-
ination rates appear consistent with those from Röser
et al. (2011). Therefore, we also calculate distance-based
Pmem for the new Goldman et al. (2013) members using
the method described in D14.

We supplement the Goldman et al. (2013) catalog
with new Hyades members found by our analysis of All
Sky Automated Survey (ASAS; Pojmański 2002) data
(Cargile et al., in prep.). We follow the method out-

lined by van Leeuwen (2009) and consider stars within
26◦ and 20 pc of the cluster center. We identify 170 clus-
ter members with reduced proper motions (µ) satisfying
−170 < µk < −60 and −20 < µ⊥ < 20 mas yr−1 and dis-
tances distances obtained by Hipparcos (Perryman et al.
1997). We add stars from the Radick et al. (1987) and
Delorme et al. (2011) catalogs that were too bright or
too faint to be included in the Hipparcos survey, so that
this catalog includes 209 stars, all of which are listed in
Table 6 of D14. All but 13 of the Hyads identiﬁed in
this manner were also identiﬁed by Röser et al. (2011)
and Goldman et al. (2013). We add these 13 stars to our
ﬁnal Hyades catalog, resulting in a membership catalog
of 786 stars with Pmem ≥ 70%.

2.2. Photometry

∼ (J − K) <

As in D14, we use (r′ − K) as our primary proxy
for stellar temperature. Optical-near infrared (NIR)
colors allow a broader dynamic range than is possible
with a narrower color index, particularly for lower-mass
stars. For example, when using NIR photometry alone,
∼ 1.2 mag,
M dwarfs only show colors 0.9 <
but stars in this same mass range are spread across
3.3 < (r′ −K) < 8.0. While nearly all the stars in our cat-
alog have 2MASS K-band magnitudes, the large range
in r′ magnitudes (≈15 mag) for these objects meant that
we had to obtain this photometry from multiple sources.
CMC14 includes r′ measurements for ≈108 stars with
declinations between −30◦ and 50◦ and 9 < r′ <
∼ 17
mag. We use this photometry for 522 Hyads falling
within this magnitude range; for the members identi-
ﬁed by Röser et al. (2011), we use the CMC14 magni-
tudes and errors listed in that catalog. For 17 Hyads

we use r′ magnitudes from the 4th U.S. Naval Observa-
tory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC4; Zacharias et al.
2012), which includes g′r′i′ magnitudes from APASS
(Henden et al. 2012). In total, 539 Hyads have r′ data
from CMC14 or UCAC4.

The remaining Hyads are too bright or too faint to
appear in CMC14 or UCAC4. We convert photometry
from other systems into r′ magnitudes for these stars.

• Thirty-three new Goldman et al. (2013) members
have SDSS ri photometry. We convert those magnitudes
to r′ using transformation equations from Jester et al.
(2005) and documented online.11

• For 44 new Goldman et al. (2013) members with pho-
tometry in all three Pan-STARRS 1 gP 1rP 1iP 1 bands, we
use appropriate equations from Tonry et al. (2012) and
Jester et al. (2005) to convert these magnitudes to SDSS
r and i magnitudes, and from there to r′.

• Eighteen new members identiﬁed by Goldman et al.
(2013) were detected in only one or two Pan-STARRS 1
bands, and lack the photometry needed for a conversion
to r′. The seven stars with detections only in gP 1 or iP 1
do not have previous Prot measurements, nor are they
K2 targets, so the lack of r′ photometry does not impact
our analysis. Eleven stars were only detected in rP 1; this
includes one K2 target, EPIC 210489654. We retain the
unconverted rP 1 magnitude for these stars.

• For 152 bright stars with r < 9 mag, we use the
Jester et al. (2005) relations to convert the USNO-A2.0

and Tycho 2 Johnson B and V magnitudes included in
the 2MASS catalog to SDSS r magnitudes. Fortuitously,
these stars fall into the appropriate color range for which
the Bilir et al. (2008) transformation from 2MASS colors
to (r − i) can be used. Finally, we use these r and (r − i)
values to obtain r′ by applying the Jester et al. (2005)
relation, as above.

The typical uncertainty for these r′ magnitudes de-
pends on the source catalog. After applying the conver-
sions discussed above to 2MASS and SDSS photometry,
the uncertainties are generally .0.1 and ≈0.3 mag, re-
spectively. For CMC14 photometry, the uncertainty is
≈0.1 mag; for UCAC4, ≈0.05 mag. The sources for all
of our photometry are shown in the color-magnitude di-
agram (CMD) for the cluster presented in Figure 1.

2.3. Archival Rotation Periods

In D14 we assembled Prot measurements for Hyads
from Radick et al. (1987, 1995); Delorme et al. (2011);
and from an analysis of ASAS data (Cargile et al., in
prep) into a catalog of 87 rotators. We now restore eight
additional stars with measured Prot that are conﬁrmed
binaries, bringing the total number of known rotators
from these studies to 95.

We then add Prot measured by Hartman et al. (2011)
for stars in our catalog of likely members. These au-
thors used light curves from the HATNet survey to search
for photometric variability among nearby ﬁeld K and M
dwarfs. Hartman et al. (2011) present Prot measured at
two diﬀerent stages in their analysis: after applying ex-
ternal parameter decorrelation and then after applying a

ﬁed candidate binaries and conﬁrmed binaries, respectively. We
also include the mass uncertainties; in general, σM ∗ ≈ 2 − 3%,
which is smaller than or comparable to the symbol size. Distance
uncertainties dominate the M∗ uncertainties; the stars with large
σM∗ have σD ≈ 10 − 20 pc. The error bars only represent system-
atic uncertainties from our mass calculation, and do not reﬂect,
e.g., systematics in the model or excess K-band ﬂux due to an
unresolved companion.

trend ﬁltering algorithm. We required that the quality
ﬂags on both periods be 0 and that the periods Hartman
et al. (2011) measured at both stages agree to within one
day. Although nine Hartman et al. (2011) targets match
objects in our Hyades catalog, two had bad quality ﬂags,
and another showed diﬀerent periods after the two dif-
ferent ﬁltering algorithms were applied; we add the six
remaining Prot to our catalog

Finally, we add two rotation periods from Prosser et al.
(1995). These authors observed stars from several open
clusters and searched for periodic variability. They tar-
geted three Hyads, and found two to be variable.

In total, we have 102 Hyads with Prot measurements
from the literature. However, 48 are conﬁrmed binaries,
and eight more are candidate binaries (see discussion be-
low). This leaves 44 single12 Hyads with measured Prot
before the addition of the K2 data. The mass-period
relationship for these 102 Hyads is shown in Figure 2.

2.4. Companions

Close companions impact the rotational evolution of
stars, potentially biasing our analysis. Additional ﬂux
from a companion star could also contaminate our mass
calculations. Therefore, we try to identify all conﬁrmed
or candidate binaries and remove these from our gy-
rochronology analysis.

In D14, we used SIMBAD and Delorme et al. (2011)
to identify nine binaries in the Hyades. We now carry

among known Hyades rotators and K2 targets.

We begin with the catalog compiled by Kopytova et al.
(2016). These authors combined the results of several
multiplicity surveys (Patience et al. 1998; Mason et al.
2001; Mermilliod et al. 2009; Morzinski 2011; Duchêne
et al. 2013), to which they added their own AstraLux
lucky imaging observations and visual companions iden-
tiﬁed in archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images.
Of 724 Röser et al. (2011) Hyads, Kopytova et al. (2016)
identify 213 as binary or multiple systems.

We add conﬁrmed binaries from Barrado y Navascues
& Stauﬀer (1996), Tokovinin (1997), Reid & Gizis (1997),
Paulson et al. (2004), Pourbaix et al. (2004), Guenther
et al. (2005), Delorme et al. (2011), Griﬃn (2012), and
Janson et al. (2014). Other known rotators and/or K2
targets were included in previous surveys, but these did
not resolve any companions (Gizis & Reid 1995; Pa-
tience et al. 1998; Reid & Mahoney 2000; Mason et al.
2001; Richichi & Percheron 2002; Paulson et al. 2004;
Duchêne et al. 2013). There are also two conﬁrmed plan-
ets in the Hyades; both have short orbital periods (Quinn
et al. 2014; Mann et al. 2015).
In total, we ﬁnd two
planet hosts and 70 conﬁrmed multiple systems among
the known rotators and K2 targets.

As in D14, we also identify candidate unresolved bina-
ries that are overluminous for their color (see Figure 3).
We use model stellar SEDs assembled by Kraus & Hillen-
brand (2007) to identify the single-star main sequence,
then identify a binary main sequence oﬀset by 0.75 mag
for a given color from that of single stars (as in Steele &
Jameson 1995). We then label stars with (r′ − K) < 4 as
candidate binaries if they lie above the midpoint between
the single-star and binary main sequences (Hodgkin et al.
1999). This method is biased toward binaries with equal
masses, so that we are certainly missing candidate bina-
ries with lower mass ratios. Indeed, the bottom panel of
Figure 3 shows conﬁrmed binaries at all distances from
the main sequence. While further observations are re-
quired to conﬁrm the binary status of all cluster mem-
bers, this photometric approach does allow the identiﬁ-
cation of a signiﬁcant number of binaries.

We only apply this method to stars with (r′ − K) < 4

because the single-star main sequence is less apparent
for stars redder than this value. The observed spread in
magnitudes could be due to binary systems at a variety of
mass ratios, or to uncertainties in distance or magnitude
for these faint red stars. Identifying even candidate bi-
naries in this regime therefore requires more information
than just photometry.

In total, after our analysis of the K2 data (Section
4), we ﬁnd that 63 Hyads with measured periods are
conﬁrmed binaries, two are conﬁrmed planet hosts, and
eight are candidate binaries. Another six K2 targets for
which we could not measure Prot are conﬁrmed binaries,
and one is a candidate. We list all conﬁrmed and can-
didate binaries in Table 2, and exclude them from our
gyrochronology analysis in Section 6.

3. STELLAR MASSES

As in D14, we estimate stellar masses (M∗) by linearly
interpolating between the MK and M∗ points given by
Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007), who list M∗ and spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) for B8-L0 stars.

We calculate MK using Hipparcos parallaxes (Perry-
man et al. 1997) where possible to determine distances
(D) to individual stars. When Hipparcos parallaxes are
not available, we use the secular parallaxes published by
Röser et al. (2011) or Goldman et al. (2013). The 13
ASAS stars that are not in the Röser et al. (2011) or
Goldman et al. (2013) catalogs do not have Hipparcos
parallaxes, and for these stars we assume D = 47 pc
(van Leeuwen 2009) with an uncertainty σD = ±10 pc.
We calculate the MK uncertainties by propagating the
mK and D uncertainties for each star, and then deter-
mine the M∗ uncertainties by passing the ±1σMK val-
ues through the same M∗ calculation as above. Most
of the uncertainties are small (σM∗ ≈ 2 − 3%), but in
a few cases, signiﬁcant distance uncertainties lead to
σM∗ ≈ 20 − 30%. Figure 2 includes these σM values.
These are simply the systematic uncertainties from our
calculation, and do not reﬂect other sources of uncer-
tainty, such as our choice of model or K-band excesses
due to a binary companion.

Figure 4. The K2 Campaign 4 ﬁeld of view, with our 65 Hyades
targets shown as orange diamonds. Because the cluster is so large
on the sky, many targets are near the edges of the ﬁeld of view,
and therefore have distorted PSFs. Two of the spacecraft’s detector
modules are no longer functioning.

4. K2 DATA

The pointing in K2 is held in an unstable equilibrium
against solar pressure by the two functioning reaction
wheels. The spacecraft rolls about the boresight by up to
1 pixel at the edge of the focal plane. To correct for this,
thrusters can be ﬁred every 6 hours (if needed) to return
the spacecraft to its original position. This drift causes
stars to move on the focal plane in a diagonal pattern,
inducing sawtooth-like signal in the 75-day light curve
for each star (Van Cleve et al. in prep.).

For stars with intrinsic long-timescale, high-amplitude
variability, the drift has minimal impact on measure-

caution to avoid removing or distorting the rotational
signature while applying instrumental corrections to the
light curves.

We analyze K2 Campaign 4 data for 65 Hyads identi-
ﬁed in Section 2.1 and with Kepler magnitudes Kp >
9 mag (see Figure 4). Sixty-two of these stars have
Pmem > 90% as calculated in Section 2.1. We exclude
an additional 14 Hyads with Kp < 9, as they are satu-
rated and therefore not amenable to our light-curve ex-
traction method. The Kp values in the EPIC catalog
are only approximate—they are computed from survey
photometry—so among the 65 Hyads are a few stars with
∼ 10 that also are too bright for our method (see

Hyades K2 Targets

4.1. Light Curve Extraction

All 65 of our targets were observed in long-cadence,
meaning exposures lasted 29.4 min. Eight of our targets
were also observed in short-cadence (58.89 s exposures),
but we restrict our analysis to the long-cadence data.

The K2 data are provided as target pixel ﬁles, which
include basic information about the target, individual
exposure frames for each time point, pipeline-calculated
background counts, and quality ﬂags for each exposure.
Quality ﬂags indicate problems with the exposure, noting
for example when data were obtained during the thruster
ﬁres. Before further analysis, we remove any exposures
with quality ﬂags not equal to 0.

The Campaign 4 data processed by the K2 pipeline is
background-subtracted, but the pipeline background cal-
culation is not reliable. The background is determined by
ﬁtting a low-order polynomial to the global background,
which misses smaller local variations, especially those
caused by dust near the Pleiades.14

We therefore perform our own background subtrac-
tion after adding the pipeline-calculated background ﬂux
back to the data. We compute the median ﬂux of all
pixels in each exposure, rejecting pixels identiﬁed as 3σ
outliers over three iterations. After three iterations, the
sigma-clipped median generally matches the levels in a
visibly source-free region, and we take this value as the
background level.

We calculate a ﬂux-weighted centroid to determine the
star’s position in each exposure. We follow Howell (2006)
in using a nine-by-nine pixel box around the nominal
target position given by the exposure’s header. We then
place soft-edged circular apertures on the star’s position
that we calculated for each exposure, so that the aperture
moves to follow the star. Tracking the motion of the star
in this manner does not entirely remove variations in
pixel sensitivity, but it does prevent nearby stars from
entering the aperture. The soft-edged apertures include
a fraction of the counts in pixels that are not entirely
within the aperture. This fraction is equal to the fraction
of the pixel covered by the aperture.

We carry out all aperture photometry and some source
detection using the photutils package.15 We extract light
curves for each target using aperture radii r ranging from
2 ≤ r ≤ 6.5 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments. The optimal
light curve for analysis is chosen at a later stage.

4.2. Accounting for Nearby Stars

We co-add the individual images for each star and
search for any nearby sources automatically and by eye.
These co-added images are included in our diagnostic
plots for each target (Figure 5).

First, we use the daoﬁnd function from photutils16
with a low threshold for detecting nearby stars. We set
sharphi=5, sharplo=0.1, and FWHM=2.5. Because the
ﬂux-weighted method will simply ﬁnd the brightest spot
in the frame, we also extract light curves for all detected
objects using daoﬁnd to track the centroids.

data in greyscale with the aperture selected in Section 4.3 shown in black. The DSS2 red image of the target is overlaid as red contours.
The WCS in the K2 target pixel ﬁles does not perfectly match the WCS in the DSS images, particularly near the edges of the ﬁeld of view
where distortion is signiﬁcant. Top right — DSS2 red image of the target, rotated to match the orientation of the K2 data. In this case,
nearby companions are clearly visible within the K2 pixel stamp, but they are excluded from the aperture used to extract the light curve.
Bottom left — K2 data in greyscale (colors reversed from above), with the centroid drift overlaid. Bottom right — The K2 footprint for
Campaign 4; the purple star indicates the position of the target.

When the sources are well separated on the chip (i.e.,
∼2 − 3 pixels), we did not ﬁnd
the neighbor’s centroid is >
any signiﬁcant variability in the neighbors’ light curves.
Therefore, we simply restrict the maximum aperture ra-
dius for the primary target so that light from the neigh-
bor does not aﬀect further analysis of the target star.

We also search by eye for any sources in the coadded
image that were missed by daoﬁnd. All the neighboring
stars are real objects that also appear on archival im-
ages, but are either too faint or too close to the edge of
the pixel stamp to be detected by daoﬁnd. Our moving
aperture method for constructing light curves requires
that sources be automatically detected either by daoﬁnd
or a ﬂux-weighted centroid, so that the source’s centroid

position can be used to deﬁne the source’s aperture in
each exposure. We are therefore unable to produce light
curves for faint neighbors that daoﬁnd cannot detect. As
above, in cases where we visually identify a faint neigh-
bor, we restrict the maximum aperture radius for the
primary target to exclude these neighbors wherever pos-
sible.

We deviate from our standard extraction procedure
in two cases where a bright neighbor on the chip bi-
ases the ﬂux-weighted centroid of the target. For EPIC
210736105, we simply use a smaller ﬁve-by-ﬁve pixel box
to calculate the ﬂux-weighted centroid, which yields the
correct position for the star. We also reduce the maxi-
mum aperture size to 2.0 pixels. The neighbor shows no

evidence of periodic variability (Figure 6).

Restricting the centroid calculation box for EPIC
210963067 does not remove the bias towards the brighter
neighbor, and the neighbor is also variable (Figure 7).
We therefore track the centroid of both the target and
its neighbor using daoﬁnd. This is the only star for which
we signiﬁcantly change our light curve extraction tech-
nique based on a neighboring star.

We also must account for the K2 imager’s large pixel
scale (4′′), which can produce blended point spread func-
tions (PSFs) even when nearby objects are well-resolved
in other surveys. We therefore compare the K2 images by
eye to Digital Sky Survey (DSS), SDSS (when available),
and 2MASS images of our targets.17 A DSS or SDSS im-
age of each target is shown in Figure 5, rotated into the
frame of the K2 image. In many cases these neighboring
stars are too close to our target to be separated, and we
ﬂag these targets as having blended neighbors.

Flags indicating whether a companion was identiﬁed by
eye and whether it is blended in the target aperture are
given in Table 4. A neighbor ﬂag of “Y” indicates that a
neighbor was identiﬁed. For these targets, a blended ﬂag
of “Y” indicates that the neighbor is deﬁnitely inside the
K2 aperture, “M” indicates that there is possible contam-
ination or overlapping PSFs that can still be separated,
and “N” indicates that the neighbor is well-separated.

4.3. Detrending Light Curves and Measuring Prot

As noted earlier, K2 light curves contain instrumental
signals that can hinder measurements of intrinsic stellar
variability. Given the 6-hour timescale for the dominant

instrumental signature in K2 light curves, however, dis-
entangling intrinsic variability from instrumental eﬀects
can be diﬃcult for stars with short-period, low-amplitude
astrophysical signals. To decouple these signatures as
best we can, we adopt an iterative approach that ﬁrst
removes intrinsic stellar signals from the light curve, so
that instrumental eﬀects can be isolated and corrected
before further analyzing the stellar variability.

We describe this iterative approach in detail below, but

the steps are to:

1. remove the long-timescale variability;
2. measure the initial periodic signal;
3. select the light curve with the optimal photometric

aperture;

4. remove periodic stellar signals from the optimal-

aperture light curve;

5. infer and correct for instrumental signatures;
6. reﬁne the initial period measurement and consider

secondary periodic signatures.

This procedure, which is similar to that used by Kraus
et al. (2015) to remove instrumental and out-of-eclipse
variability from the K2 light curve for UScoCTIO 5, a
spectroscopic binary in the Upper Scorpius star-forming
region, is illustrated in Figure 8.

We also test a modiﬁed version of the Vanderburg &
Johnson (2014) algorithm. Unlike the original Vander-
burg & Johnson (2014) algorithm, the modiﬁed version
removes as much periodic signal as possible before ﬁt-
ting for the instrumental drift. While this method pro-
duced light curves consistent with our own, there were
some diﬀerences. First, our method rejects outliers, and
is therefore less sensitive to transits or ﬂares. Second,

Figure 7. Same as Figure 6, but for EPIC 210963067 and its nearby neighbor (at center and lower left, respectively, in postage stamp at
left). In this case both the target and neighbor show periodic variability on diﬀerent timescales. Furthermore, restricting the centroid box
does not prevent the brighter neighbor from biasing the centroid. Therefore, we use the light curves shown above, which were extracted
using daoﬁnd centroid, for our analysis in Section 4.3.

the modiﬁed Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) algorithm
introduces jumps in the light curves for stars with longer
Prot. Our method also more aggressively removes long-
term trends from the light curves, but these trends are
not periodic and likely not from rotation.

4.3.1. Removing long-timescale variability

We begin by computing a low-power smoothed version
of the raw light curve using supersmoother, a Python
implementation of the SuperSmoother non-parametric
adaptive smoothing algorithm (Friedman 1984).18 Su-
perSmoother selects the best local smoothing window for
each point in a data series. The degree of smoothing can
be set using the bass-enhancement value α: low values of
α retain more local variability, while high values of α only
retain long term trends. We set the bass-enhancement
value to the maximum possible value of α = 10. In most
cases, the smoothed curve is eﬀectively linear, but in
some cases the data include slow trends, and this method
accounts for these trends. This smoothed curve is over-
laid on the raw light curve in the top panel of Figure 8.
We divide the data by this smoothed curve to produce
the detrended light curve, shown in green in the second
panel of Figure 8.

4.3.2. Measuring the initial periodic signal

We measure rotation periods using the fast Lomb-
Scargle function from the gatspy package.19 This is an
implementation of the FFT-based algorithm from Press
& Rybicki (1989). We compute the periodogram power
for 3×104 periods ranging from 0.1 d to 70.8 d (the length
of the Campaign), though in practice we only consider
periods <40 d in our analysis.

18 https://github.com/jakevdp/supersmoother
19 https://github.com/astroML/gatspy

At every step, we calculate minimum signiﬁcance levels
for periodogram peaks using non-parametric bootstrap
resampling. We generate 1000 simulated light curves
for each source by holding the observation times ﬁxed
and randomly re-drawing the ﬂux values with replace-
ment. We compute a periodogram for each simulated
light curve, and record the maximum power in each pe-
riodogram. The 99.9-percentile value of the maximum
peak serves as the 0.1% signiﬁcance level for peak detec-
tion.

In general, the minimum signiﬁcance levels for our pe-
riodogram are extremely low. The grey line representing
the 0.1% signiﬁcance level is rarely visible in the peri-
odograms in Figure 8. This is likely due to K2’s high
observation cadence. If a periodic signal is present, ran-
domly reshuﬄing the data will almost certainly destroy
it, leaving no signiﬁcant peaks in the periodogram (the
30-min observing cadence is outside our search range).
Even the 6-hour thruster ﬁring timescale will be wiped
out in this resampling. Therefore, most periodic signals
we ﬁnd in our analysis are likely real, though we must
still distinguish between stellar and instrumental sources.
We compute periodograms for both the raw and the de-
trended light curves, and select for further analysis the
light curve with the highest peak in its periodogram. For
this comparison, we only consider peaks at less than 40 d
that do not correspond to a low multiple of the 6-hour
thruster ﬁring period; the periodogram peaks that fail
these cuts likely correspond to the instrumental signa-
tures or long trends in the raw light curve that we are
trying to remove.

4.3.3. Selecting the optimal photometric aperture

Initially, we detrend all raw light curves for each tar-
get using the process described above, and then select
from among all possible apertures the light curve with
the highest periodogram peak after the raw/detrended

The top four rows show the light curve at diﬀerent stages of processing. The center row shows periodograms for each light curve; the
corresponding 99.9% signiﬁcance levels (dot-dashed grey line) are generally too close to 0 to be visible. The second-to-last row shows the
phased light curves with a smoothed version overlaid, and bottom row shows the residuals between those two. We divide the raw light curve
(top, black) by a smoothed, low-power version (green line) to produce the detrended light curve (second panel, green). Either the raw or
detrended light curve is chosen for further analysis based on which has the highest periodogram peak between 0.1 − 40 d; the corresponding
periodogram is shown in the left column. We then account for the eﬀect of the spacecraft drift, producing the corrected light curve (blue,
third row and center column). We also look for additional periods by smoothing the phased, corrected light curve and dividing the periodic
signal away, producing the secondary light curve (pink, fourth row and right column). In general, the period derived from the corrected
light curve is the ﬁnal period, but in a few cases, the period from the secondary light curve is more likely the true period.

selection. An aperture that is too small will not contain
a star’s full PSF, decreasing the signal to noise, while a
larger aperture may include nearby stars that contami-
nate the light curve. By selecting the light curve with the
strongest initial peak, we begin with the cleanest possi-
ble light curve. We refer to the light curve selected for
further analysis as the initial light curve.

In some cases, we restrict the maximum possible aper-
ture to exclude nearby stars; see Section 4.2 for details.

4.3.4. Removing periodic stellar signals

We iteratively smooth the initial light curve selected in
the previous step before correcting for the centroid drift
across the detector. We phase-fold the light curve on
the best period, and use supersmoother again to produce
a smoothed version of the periodic signal. We then di-
vide the light curve by the smoothed periodic light curve.
We repeat this process up to six times, or until one of
two conditions is met: either the maximum periodogram
power falls below 10% of the initial power, or the high-
est remaining peak is a harmonic of the 6-hour thruster
ﬁring period. This produces a ﬂattened light curve that
should only contain instrumental signals.

4.3.5. Inferring and correcting for instrumental signatures
Once all signiﬁcant periodic signals have been removed
from the light curve, leaving it relatively ﬂat, we use it
to correct the initial light curve for instrumental signals.
At each epoch in the light curve, we ﬁnd the 21 other
epochs with the closest centroid positions (in detector
coordinates) to the epoch being corrected. We then di-
vide each point in the initial light curve by the median of
the ﬂattened light curve at those 21 neighboring points.
This produces the corrected light curve shown in dark
blue in the third panel of Figure 8; for most of our tar-
gets, the Prot measured from the corrected light curve is
selected as the ﬁnal Prot.

The Prot measured from the initial and corrected light
curves are in general consistent with each other (Figure
9). There are four exceptions, where the Prot measured
from both the initial and corrected light curves are spu-
rious, representing non-periodic trends.

4.3.6. Reﬁning the initial period measurement

After correcting for instrumental eﬀects, we also re-
move the dominant periodic signal to search for any ad-
ditional signals. We phase-fold the corrected light curve
and then use supersmoother to produce a smoothed ver-
sion of the periodic signal, shown in pink in the third
panel of Figure 8. We then divide the corrected light
curve by this smoothed periodic curve to produce the
secondary light curve, shown in the fourth panel of Fig-
ure 8.

We examine by eye the light curves produced for each
object at each stage in the analysis. We note quality
ﬂags, any evidence of spot evolution and/or multiple pe-
riods, and select the ﬁnal Prot from either the corrected
or secondary light curve.

Our visual inspection of the periodograms and phased
light curves prevents instrumental signals from contam-
inating our sample. We tested our algorithm on 3600
other Campaign 4 targets with 9 ≤ Kp ≤ 16.5, and we
detect periods between 20-25 d in ≈ 20% of the cor-

Figure 9. Comparison of Prot measured at diﬀerent stages of
our analysis. The solid line corresponds to a one-to-one match;
the dotted lines represent double- and half-period harmonics. In
general, the Prot measured from the initial and corrected light
curves are consistent (black dots).
In four cases, the corrected

periodic noise in the corrected light curve. Lines connect each of
these Prot values to the crosses that represent the secondary Prot,
which is more likely the true period (see also Figure 10).

rected light curves. These periodogram peaks are typ-
ically wide, and appear with other wide peaks around
40 d and 70 d. We believe these to be low frequency
noise and/or a harmonic with the 70 d campaign length,
and they appear particularly (though not exclusively) in
light curves where the spacecraft drift is the only signal.
Our visual inspection allows us to separate these spurious
detections from genuine sinusoidal rotational variability,
and we are conﬁdent in the ≈ 20 d rotation periods that
we identify for four Hyads.20

We ﬂag the light-curve quality on a scale of 0–2: 0 is a
conﬁdent detection, 1 indicates signiﬁcant residual noise
in the light curve that may aﬀect the ﬁnal period mea-
surement, or confusion about which periodogram peak
corresponds to the dominant period, and 2 indicates that
the spacecraft drift pattern dominates the light curve or
that there is some other fatal problem with the period
measurement.

We also add ﬂags for the presence of spot evolution and
multiple periodic signals in the light curve. For spot evo-
lution and multiperiodic signals, we use “Y,” “M,” and
“N” ﬂags, for “Yes,” “Maybe,” and “No.” When there is
signiﬁcant power at half or twice the chosen period, we
phase-fold the light curve at those harmonics and note
in Table 4 whether they could be the true period. We
also note in Table 4 when there are two clear peaks in
the periodogram and there is confusion over which is the
dominant period, or when any visible periodic signals are
not picked up in our analysis.

Figure 10. Four light curves for which the Prot measured from the secondary light curve is more likely the true value. The corrected light
curves (left) show non-periodic structures that dominate the periodogram. This is removed by dividing out the smoothed curve (grey),
which produces the secondary light curves (right).

In most cases, the secondary period is a harmonic of
either the thruster-ﬁring period or the fundamental pe-
riod, or a clear, unrelated signal. In four cases, however,
the period from the corrected light curve is spurious, and
the period from the secondary light curve is selected as
the real period. These four corrected light curves, shown
in Fig. 10 show structure that was not removed by the
initial low-power detrending, but which was removed by
the smoothing used to produce the secondary light curve.
The periods measured from the initial and corrected light
curves appear to be an instrumental signal, and the sec-
ondary period looks more like a rotational signal (see
Figures 9 and 10).

4.4. Light Curves With Multiple Periodic Signals

A subset of Hyades light curves in our sample show
multiple signiﬁcant periodogram peaks. The secondary
peaks can generally be classiﬁed into two categories: har-
monics of the fundamental period that appear due to
symmetric spot coverage or spot evolution (21 cases) or
a real secondary period (eight cases).

Spot evolution and double-dip light curves due to sym-
metric spot distributions have been observed in many Ke-
pler stars (e.g., Walkowicz et al. 2013; McQuillan et al.
2013). All 11 Hyads with Prot from the literature and
this work show at least some evidence for spot evolution
in their K2 light curves. In two of these cases we ﬁnd a
diﬀerent rotation period than in the literature (see Sec-
tion 5.1 below), and spot evolution is the likely culprit
for this discrepancy.

The cause of two distinct signals in the light curve
is more diﬃcult to untangle, but likely comes from an
unresolved second star on the chip. Of the 11 stars with
light curves that deﬁnitely or possibly contain multiple
periodic signals, seven are conﬁrmed binaries and one has
a neighbor that is unresolved on the K2 chip.

5. RESULTS

We present Prot measurements for 48 Hyades mem-
bers, including 37 members with no prior Prot measure-
ment. Our Prot values, ﬂags, and analysis outputs are
found in Table 4, where we also note whether we initially
choose the raw or detrended light curve for analysis, and
whether the ﬁnal period is selected from the corrected or
secondary light curve. Our new rotation periods, along
with literature values, are shown as a function of stellar
mass in Figure 11.

Nearly all of these new periods are for Hyads with

We could not measure Prot for the 17 K2 targets listed
in Table 3. In two cases, nearby bright stars contaminate
the PSF. The PSF of another target extends beyond the
pixel stamp; the estimated Kp magnitude was likely too
faint. Six other stars with nearby neighbors show peri-
odic signals in light curves extracted with apertures of
r = 4 − 6 pixels, but exhibit mostly noise when the aper-
ture is restricted to exclude these faint neighbors. Thus,
it is possible that a neighbor is the source of the periodic
variability rather than the target star. Finally, in two
cases, the signal looks sinusoidal, but the measured Prot
is too close to the 6-hour thruster ﬁring period to be sure
that it is a stellar signal.

For the remaining six stars, however, the light curves
are dominated by instrumental noise caused by the point-
ing drift. Although some of our faintest targets are
among these 16, the noise-dominated light curves come
from stars across the full brightness range of our sample.
Thus, these noisy stars are likely to have very small am-
plitude variability, and our inability to extract periods
for these stars does not necessarily imply a failure of our
method for faint stars.

5.1. Consistency With Prior Prot Measurements

Eleven K2 targets have Prot measured by previous au-
thors; the measurements are generally consistent (see Ta-
ble 1), with two exceptions.

Delorme et al. (2011) measure Prot = 13.51 d for EPIC
210771915, while our analysis of ASAS data gave us
Prot = 7.19 d. In D14, we used the shorter ASAS-derived
period, but our analysis of the K2 data shows that the
longer Delorme et al. (2011) period is correct. The K2
light curve for this star shows a prominent double-dip
feature and evidence for spot evolution. The shorter pe-
riod we initially derived is a half-period harmonic of the
true period.

In our analysis of ASAS stars, we measure Prot =
8.37 d for EPIC 211058178, while we measure Prot =
12.32 d with K2 data. The K2 light curve for this star
shows rapid evolution on timescales close to and shorter
than the rotation period, and the amplitude of variabil-
ity drops from nearly 1% to ≈0.1% over the course of
Campaign 4. The star is also a conﬁrmed spectroscopic
binary (Paulson et al. 2004), and is therefore excluded
from our gyrochronology analysis.

Overall, however, the Prot measurements are consistent
from study to study. For example, one Prosser et al.
(1995) target was also observed by Delorme et al. (2011)
and by K2, and the three derived Prot agree at the 1%
level. The variation among Prot measured by diﬀerent
surveys for the same star are frequently of order a few
percent, and usually <10% (see Table 1). This overall
consistency is a good sign for future rotation studies,
especially since K2’s baseline and cadence do allow us
to identify two instances where sampling likely aﬀected
earlier results.

5.2. Stellar Rotation and Multiplicity at 625 Myr

Based on previous studies, we expect Hyades members
∼ 0.6 − 0.7 M⊙ to be conﬁned to a single-valued
with M∗
>
M∗(Prot) relation that also deﬁnes the upper envelope of
rotation for lower-mass stars, while less massive stars to

show a wide spread in Prot (Barnes 2003; Irwin & Bouvier
2009; Agüeros et al. 2011). We refer to the upper enve-
lope of Prot values as the slow-rotator sequence, and the
lower envelope as the rapid rotator sequence (labelled the
“I sequence” and “C sequence,” respectively, by Barnes
2003). We also expect all fully convective stars to be
rapidly rotating at this age, with a break in the slow-
rotator sequence around the transition between partially
and fully convective stars (Irwin & Bouvier 2009; Newton
et al. 2015).

The upper envelope of rotation in the Hyades is consis-
tent with previous observations of rotation in open clus-
ters. One notable exception, EPIC 210489654 (M∗ =
0.35 M⊙, Prot = 45 d), lies well above the rest of the
Hyads.
It is a conﬁrmed binary (Janson et al. 2014),
which may be the cause of its unusually slow Prot for
this age, or it may be an older ﬁeld star whose proper
motion happens to match the Hyades’s. Besides this out-
lier, the Hyades slow-rotator sequence is well-deﬁned for
∼ 0.3 M⊙ stars, with Prot increasing slightly toward
M∗
lower masses.

>

Once binary systems are excluded, we do not see
strong evidence for a transition in rotation properties
at M∗ ≈ 0.6 M⊙. Only three rapid rotators with
0.6 & M∗ & 0.3 M⊙ remain, and none has been sur-
veyed for binary companions. Therefore, we cannot rule
out multiplicity (Morgan et al. 2012) or closely orbiting
giant planets (Poppenhaeger & Wolk 2014) as the cause
for their more rapid rotation. These outliers should be
priority targets for future multiplicity surveys; they are
most likely binaries, meaning that the period-mass rela-
tion for single stars is single-valued for M∗ & 0.3 M⊙

It is also possible that the reported Prot for these three
remaining rapid rotators with 0.6 & M∗ & 0.3 M⊙ are
aliases of longer periods. All three have Prot derived from
the same survey (Delorme et al. 2011), and these authors
note that they are sensitive to Prot between 1 − 20 d.
Although only a few K2 targets fall within the 0.6 &
M∗ & 0.3 M⊙ range, we are sensitive to the full range

14

Douglas et al.

of possible Prot values. However, we only detect long
∼10 d) rotation periods for stars in this mass range.
( >
The break in the slow-rotator sequence around the
transition to full convection (≈0.3 M⊙) is hard to quan-
tify due to a pair of slowly rotating mid-M dwarfs. EPIC
211137806 (M∗ = 0.13 M⊙, Prot = 14.38 d) is newly
identiﬁed as a candidate Hyad by Röser et al. (2011).
EPIC 210736105 (M∗ = 0.23 M⊙, Prot = 20.31 d) was
cataloged as a cluster member by Reid (1992), but it
has not been surveyed for multiplicity.21 Based on their
slow rotation periods, these stars are likely either un-
resolved multiple systems or older ﬁeld interlopers, but
we cannot conﬁrm this without radial velocity or high-
resolution imaging data.

<

Despite these two outliers, nearly all Hyads with
∼ 0.3 M⊙ have Prot < 5 d. This is consistent with ex-
M∗
isting evidence that fully convective M dwarfs stay spin-
ning rapidly for several Gyr (Newton et al. 2015). The
fastest fully convective rotators are conﬁrmed binary sys-
tems, similar to the eﬀect observed in more massive stars.

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Implications for Gyrochronology

As described above, empirical studies of rotation in
open clusters identify two regimes in the Prot(M∗) plane
for partially convective stars: above a particular mass,
most stars are conﬁned to a single-valued Prot(M∗) se-
quence, and below this mass, stars exhibit a wide range
of Prot values (Barnes 2003). Gyrochronology studies
typically focus on the evolution of the slow-rotator se-
quence, which is unaﬀected by our results. The same
studies make predictions for the age-dependent location
of the transition between the single-valued sequence and
the wider spread in Prot values. Previous work on the
Hyades and the co-eval Praesepe cluster suggests that
this transition occurs around 0.6−0.7 M⊙ for ≈600 Myr-
old stars (Agüeros et al. 2011, D14).

Our results indicate that, after conﬁrmed binaries are
removed, the sequence of slowly rotating likely single-star
Hyades members breaks down at ≈0.3 M⊙. This is has
important consequences for models of stellar spin-down.
∼0.3 M⊙ stars converge onto the slow-rotator
If single >
sequence by the age of the Hyades, then this will skew
empirical gyrochronological relations (i.e., Barnes 2003),
which are currently calibrated such that this transition
occurs at ≈0.6 M⊙ in the Hyades.

Since rotation and activity are generally correlated,
we would expect that any behavior observed in the
mass-period plane would be reﬂected when analyzing the
strength of the Hα line (a chromospheric proxy for the
magnetic-ﬁeld strength) for these same stars. Speciﬁ-
∼0.3 M⊙ are all binaries, then
cally, if rapid rotators >
Hα emitters above that threshold mass should predomi-
nantly be binaries as well. In D14 we found that, for stars
in the Hyades and the co-eval Praesepe cluster, both Prot
and Hα activity transitioned from a mostly single-valued

21 EPIC 210736105 also has an angular light curve with a fast
rise and slow decline reminiscent of a Cepheid variable (Figure 6).
However, period-luminosity relationships for Classical or Type II
Cepheids imply a distance of ≈24 kpc or ≈7 kpc, respectively
(Gieren et al. 1998; Matsunaga et al. 2009), which is too far away
to account for the observed proper motion. There is also a brighter
star nearby, but that star does not show evidence of periodic vari-
ability (Figure 6).

sequence to a wider spread in Prot or equivalent width at
about 0.6 − 0.7 M⊙, or spectral types K7-M0. However,
we did not consider the binary status of Praesepe and
Hyades members in that analysis.

Because binary companions will add excess K-band
ﬂux and impact our mass calculations, we now re-
examine this transition as a function of (r′ − K) rather
than mass. Using color keeps equal-mass binaries closer
to the correct location for their spectral type, although
low-mass companions could still redden a star’s colors.

We ﬁnd that the transition in activity and Prot occurs
around (r′ − K) ≈ 4, corresponding to spectral types
of M2-M3 or M∗ ≈ 0.3 − 0.4 M⊙ (Figure 12). Bluer
stars with higher-than-average Hα equivalent widths or
rotating more rapidly than average are nearly all bina-
ries. This provides further evidence that binaries have
contaminated previous studies of Prot evolution in open
clusters.

The Hyades’s proximity means it has been extensively
studied for multiplicity, and may be the best current
example of how binaries aﬀect the period-mass plane.
Other, more distant clusters may not have received the
same attention. Roughly 45% of Hyads with measured
∼30% of all
Prot are conﬁrmed binaries, and in total >
Hyads are conﬁrmed binaries. The co-eval Praesepe clus-
ter, in contrast, has ≈1200 members (Kraus & Hillen-
brand 2007) compared to the Hyades’s ≈800, but <20%
Praesepe stars have conﬁrmed companions. While ex-
periments like K2 are providing many new Prot measure-
ments for open cluster stars, complementary binary sur-
veys are needed to investigate the impact of multiplicity
on current age-rotation relations.

gular momentum lost by a rotating solid sphere due to
magnetic braking. These authors initialize their model
using Prot and masses measured for 5-Myr-old stars in
the Orion Nebula Cluster and NGC 2264, then evolve
these stars forward in time. They show that their model
broadly reproduces the shape of the mass-period plane
at 625 Myr as deﬁned by then-available Prot for Prae-
sepe and the Hyades, but a detailed comparison to these
data shows several discrepancies. The upper envelope of
slow rotators in the Reiners & Mohanty (2012) model has

<

a diﬀerent slope than the data; these authors attribute
this to the eﬀects of core-envelope coupling, which their
model does not include. The Reiners & Mohanty (2012)
model also predicts shorter Prot values than is observed
for M∗

∼ 0.6 M⊙ (Figure 13).

Matt et al. (2015) also derive a model for the spin-down
of a solid sphere due to magnetic braking. These au-
thors’ initial conditions approximate the distribution of
Prot observed for 2 − 5 Myr-old stars, but are not drawn
directly from observations. They also allow the stellar
radius and moment of inertia to evolve with time follow-
ing evolutionary tracks. The Matt et al. (2015) model
better predicts the mass dependence of the slow-rotator
sequence for Hyads with M∗

∼ 0.6 M⊙ (Figure 14).

∼ M∗

Matt et al. (2015) ﬁnd that their model at 573 Myr
fails to predict a set of rapid rotators in Praesepe with
0.7 <
∼ 1.0 M⊙, and these authors attribute the dis-
crepancy to a change in the magnetic torque exerted on
these stars. However, we ﬁnd that any rapidly rotating
Hyads in that mass regime are known multiple systems,
and most of the rapidly rotating Praesepe members at
those masses are identiﬁed as candidate binaries in D14.
Both models predict more rapid rotators than ob-
∼0.9 M⊙ Hyads, which indicates that magne-
served for <
tized winds more eﬀectively brake stellar rotation than
the models predict. These discrepancies are most pro-
∼ 0.6 M⊙, and suggest two transition
nounced for M∗
<
points in braking behavior: one around the beginning
of the M-dwarf regime, and one at the boundary to full
convection.

<

<

∼ M∗

Hyads with 0.3 <

∼ 0.6 M⊙ rotate more slowly
than either model predicts, extending the slow-rotator
sequence to the fully convective boundary. Matt et al.
(2015) suggest that this is due to internal angular mo-
mentum transport that is not included in their models.
Alternately, a change in magnetic ﬁeld geometry could
increase the braking eﬃciency for M dwarfs relative to
the prescriptions of Matt et al. (2015), which match G
and K stars well. Zeeman Doppler imaging studies ﬁnd a
transition in magnetic ﬁeld properties at around 0.5 M⊙,
not at the transition to fully convective stars (Donati
& Landstreet 2009; Donati 2011). Most M dwarfs have
much stronger and more poloidal ﬁelds than their more
massive counterparts with the same Prot, though some
still have weaker and/or more toroidal ﬁelds. Poloidal
ﬁelds should lead to more eﬀective magnetic braking be-
cause they allow for larger magnetic wind torques due to
a larger Alfvén radius and more eﬃcient mass loss in the
equatorial plane, compared to more complex ﬁelds (Gar-
raﬀo et al. 2015a,b). This could explain why the models
fail to reproduce the population of slow rotators with
∼ 0.6 M⊙ in the Hyades and Praesepe; future
0.3 <
models will need to account for the enhanced braking
eﬃciency in this mass range.

∼ M∗

<

A second transition point occurs around the fully con-
vective boundary, where core-envelope coupling becomes
irrelevant. Since these stars have no core to decouple
from their convective zone, the solid-body model used
by Reiners & Mohanty (2012) and Matt et al. (2015)
∼0.3 M⊙ stars best, and the stellar
should match these <
wind model is a likely culprit for the observed discrep-
ancy. The discrepancy with observations is more pro-
nounced in the Reiners & Mohanty (2012) model, where

the model Prot distribution appears to be shifted down
by a factor of 3 − 4 relative to observations. The Matt
et al. (2015) model extends to slightly faster Prot than
we observe in this mass range, but overall does a better
job of replicating the fully convective Hyads. This indi-
cates that, despite the discrepancy with early M dwarfs,
the Matt et al. (2015) model better captures the overall
internal angular momentum and wind loss rates for fully
convective stars.

7. CONCLUSIONS

1. We have extracted and analyzed K2 light curves
for 65 Hyades members. We measure rotation pe-
riods for 48 of these, including 37 Hyads without
previous Prot. This is the ﬁrst time rotation pe-
riods have been measured for single Hyades mem-
bers that deﬁnitively fall below the fully convective
∼ 0.3 M⊙). A total of 139 Hyades
boundary (M∗
members now have measured Prot.

<

2. We have assembled binary information from the lit-
erature for all Hyads with measured Prot and for
those targeted by K2. We ﬁnd that 63 of 139 stars
with measured Prot are conﬁrmed binary or mul-
tiple systems. This ensures that, to the best of
present knowledge, our gyrochronological analysis
is based on a sample of single stars.

3. We ﬁnd that most,

if not all, rapid rotators
∼ 0.3 M⊙ are multiple systems. Most
with M∗

single stars have spun down to a single-valued
mass-period relationship, indicating that multiplic-
ity must be considered when analyzing the mass-
period plane.

4. We ﬁnd that magnetic braking models predict more

range of masses. The discrepancy in the fully con-
vective regime in particular indicates that magnetic
braking is more eﬃcient than predicted.

The Hyades’s large apparent size on the sky has limited
surveys for rotation in the cluster, and the mass range
where rotators appear to be missing is at the faint end
of previous surveys. This is compounded by a dip in
membership numbers around 0.4 . M∗ . 0.6 M⊙. Even
if our data suggest more fundamental theoretical chal-
lenges, at this time we cannot rule out these selection
eﬀects as being responsible for points 3–4 above.

Additional Prot measurements, both for the Hyades
and the co-eval Praesepe cluster, are needed to rule out
these selection eﬀects. K2 observed ≈700 Praesepe mem-
bers in Campaign 5; those data are now public, and will
be the focus of our next paper. Furthermore, K2 is slated
to return to the Hyades in Campaign 13, and the planned
ﬁeld position could yield ≈100 additional Prot for cluster
members.

More binary surveys are also needed in both clusters
to match these Prot samples and conﬁrm the eﬀect of
multiplicity on the period-mass plane at ≈600 Myr. The
∼0.3 M⊙ Hyads have not
remaining rapidly rotating M∗
been surveyed for companions, and many planned Cam-
paign 13 targets are also missing from existing multiplic-
ity studies. Comparable Prot and multiplicity samples
are also needed in other clusters to further investigate
how binarity impacts age-rotation relations.

Note. — This table is available in its entirety in a machine-readable form in the online journal. A portion is shown here for guidance regarding its form and content.

a Röser et al. (2011)
b Gives source of previous Prot measurement, if any. P is Prosser et al. (1995), D is Delorme et al. (2011), and A is from our analysis of ASAS data (Cargile et al. in prep). There is no overlap between
the Radick et al. (1987, 1995), Hartman et al. (2011) and K2 samples.
c Quality ﬂag. 0 is a conﬁdent detection, 1 indicates residual noise or confusion in the periodogram.
d Indicated binary status (Section 2.4, Table 2). 0 indicates a single star (to the best of our knowledge), 1 is a photometrically identiﬁed candidate binary, and 2 is a conﬁrmed binary from the literature.
e Indicates visible spot evolution over several cycles. “Y,” “M,” and “N” ﬂags indicate “Yes,” “Maybe,” and “No.”
f Indicates multiple periods in the periodogram. “Y,” “M,” and “N” ﬂags indicate “Yes,” “Maybe,” and “No.”
