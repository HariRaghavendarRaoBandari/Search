New complex analytic methods in the study of

non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

Abstract The aim of this work is to adapt the complex analytic methods
originating in modern Oka theory to the study of non-orientable conformal
minimal surfaces in Rn for any n ≥ 3. These methods, which we develop
essentially from the ﬁrst principles, enable us to prove that the space of conformal
minimal immersions of a given bordered non-orientable surface to Rn is a real
analytic Banach manifold (see Theorem 1.1), obtain approximation results of
Runge-Mergelyan type for conformal minimal immersions from non-orientable
surfaces (see Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3), and show general position theorems
for non-orientable conformal minimal surfaces in Rn (see Theorem 1.4). We
also give the ﬁrst known example of a properly embedded non-orientable minimal
surface in R4; a M¨obius strip (see Example 6.1).

All our new tools mentioned above apply to non-orientable minimal surfaces
endowed with a ﬁxed choice of a conformal structure. This enables us to
obtain signiﬁcant new applications to the global theory of non-orientable minimal
surfaces.
In particular, we construct proper non-orientable conformal minimal
surfaces in Rn with any given conformal structure (see Theorem 1.6 (i)), complete
non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn with arbitrary conformal type whose
generalized Gauss map is nondegenerate and omits n hyperplanes of CPn−1 in
general position (see Theorem 1.6 (iii)), complete non-orientable minimal surfaces
bounded by Jordan curves (see Theorem 1.5), and complete proper non-orientable
minimal surfaces normalized by bordered surfaces in p-convex domains of Rn (see
Theorem 1.7).

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. A summary of the main results. A minimal surface in Rn for n ≥ 3 is
a 2-dimensional smoothly embedded or immersed submanifold which is locally area
minimizing. The study of such surfaces was initiated by Euler and Lagrange in the 18th
In 1776, Meusnier showed that a surface in Rn is minimal if and only if its
century.
mean curvature vector vanishes at every point. This observation ties the theory of minimal
surfaces with differential geometry. For background and history, we refer e.g. to the
monographs by Osserman [79], Meeks and P´erez [75], and Colding and Minicozzi [28].

Given an immersion X : N → Rn from a smooth surface N, there is a unique conformal
structure on N which makes X conformal (angle preserving); namely, the one determined
by the pullback X∗ds2 of the standard Euclidean metric ds2 on Rn. The immersion is said
to be complete if X∗ds2 is a complete metric on N. A surface N endowed with a conformal
structure will be denoted by the corresponding caligraphic letter N . It is classical that a
conformal immersion is minimal, in the sense that it parametrizes a minimal surface in Rn,
if and only if it is harmonic. If in addition N is orientable, then it carries the structure of a
Riemann surface; this makes it possible to study harmonic maps N → Rn as real parts of
holomorphic maps N → Cn. It is therefore not surprising that the orientable case has been
studied extensively by exploiting complex analytic methods.

Non-orientable minimal surfaces have also attracted considerable interest. Although the
study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in R3 was initiated by Lie back in 1878 (see [66]),
the global theory, and in particular the use of complex analytic tools in its development, only
began in the eighties of the last century with the seminal paper of Meeks [73]; see also L´opez
[68, 69] and the references therein. Every surface is locally orientable, and hence we can
study harmonic maps at least locally as real parts of holomorphic maps. Recently, Alarc´on
and L´opez [20] renewed the interest in this subject by proving the Mergelyan approximation
theorem for non-orientable minimal surfaces in R3.

The aim of this work is to adapt the complex analytic methods originating in modern Oka
theory (see [39, 40] for the latter) to the study of non-orientable conformal minimal surfaces
in Rn for any n ≥ 3. In the orientable case, these methods have been introduced in the recent
works [6, 10, 11, 12, 13]. As in [20], the main idea is to pass to the oriented double cover
which is a Riemann surface endowed with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic involution;
see Subsec. 1.2. For reasons that will become apparent shortly, the non-orientable case is
considerably more delicate both from the geometric and topological point of view, as well
as from the purely technical side.

The core of the work is Section 3 where we develop the relevant complex analytic
methods essentially from the ﬁrst principles. These methods represent the main new
technical contribution of the paper.
The subsequent sections are devoted to their
implementation in the construction of non-orientable conformal minimal surfaces in Rn
enjoying a variety of additional properties. Here is a brief summary of our main results;

bordered surfaces in p-convex domains (see Theorem 6.8).

One of the major novelties of our approach, when compared with the existing works on
the subject, is that our results hold for any given conformal structure on the source surface.
It is well known that problems typically become substantially easier if one allows changes of
the complex (=conformal) structure. In the context of Oka theory, results of the latter type
are referred to as soft Oka theory. To give a simple example, most continuous maps N → Y
from an open non-simply connected Riemann surface N to another complex manifold Y are
not homotopic to a holomorphic map; this already fails for maps between annuli, or for maps
to C\{0, 1}. On the other hand, every continuous map admits a holomorphic representative
in the same homotopy class if one allows a homotopic deformation of the complex structure
on the source surface N . (See [39, Theorem 9.10.1, p. 446] for a substantially more general
result in this direction.)

A glance at the above list shows that most of our results pertain to the global theory of
non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn. This part of the theory, which has been a very active
focus of research during the last ﬁve decades (see e.g. the recent surveys [61, 75]), concerns
the questions how global assumptions such as Riemannian completeness, embeddedness,
or properness (in Rn, or in a given domain or class of domains in Rn), inﬂuence the
topological, geometrical and conformal properties of minimal surfaces. Ours seems to be
the ﬁrst systematic investigation of this part of the theory in the case of non-orientable
minimal surfaces in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension n ≥ 3.

1.2. Basic notions of minimal surface theory. In order to describe the content of this
work in more detail, we need to recall some of the basics of the theory of minimal surfaces;
we refer to Section 2 for further details and to Osserman [79] for a more complete treatment.
A non-orientable minimal surface in Rn is the image of a conformal minimal immersion
X : N → Rn from a non-orientable surface, N , endowed with a conformal structure.
Just as in the orientable case, a conformal immersion to Rn is minimal if and only if it
is harmonic. There is a 2-sheeted oriented covering ι : N → N of N by a Riemann
surface, N , with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic involution I : N → N (the deck
transformation) such that N = N /I. Any conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn
arises from a conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn which is I-invariant, in the
sense that
(1.1)

X ◦ I = X.

The bridge between minimal surface theory in Rn and complex analysis in Cn is spanned
by the classical Weierstrass representation which we now recall; see Osserman [79] for the
orientable framework and Meeks [73] and Alarc´on-L´opez [20] for the non-orientable one
in dimension n = 3. More details can be found in Subsec. 2.4.

Let d = ∂ + ∂ be the decomposition of the exterior differential on a Riemann surface N
as the sum of the C-linear part ∂ and the C-antilinear part ∂. Thus, holomorphic maps
Z : N → Cn are those satisfying ∂Z = 0, while harmonic maps X : N → Rn are
characterized by the equation ∂∂X = −∂∂X = 0. Given a conformal minimal immersion
X = (X1, . . . , Xn) : N → Rn, the Cn-valued 1-form

Φ := ∂X = (φ1, . . . , φn), with φj = ∂Xj for j = 1, . . . , n,

(φ1)2 + (φ2)2 + ··· + (φn)2 = 0

is holomorphic (since X is harmonic), it does not vanish anywhere on N since X is an
immersion, and it satisﬁes the nullity condition
(1.2)
characterizing the conformality of X. If the immersion X is also I-invariant (see (1.1)),
then the 1-form Φ = ∂X is I-invariant in the sense that
(1.3)
Note that dX = 2ℜ(∂X) = 2ℜΦ and hence Φ has vanishing real periods:

Conversely,

N and satisﬁes I∗(ℜΦ) = ℜΦ; hence, for any ﬁxed p0 ∈ N the integral

is a well-deﬁned I-invariant conformal minimal immersion satisfying ∂X = Φ.

Let us ﬁx a nowhere vanishing I-invariant holomorphic 1-form θ on N (for the existence

of such 1-form, see [20, Corollary 6.5]). Given Φ as above, the holomorphic map

f := Φ/θ = (f1, . . . , fn) : N −→ Cn

is I-invariant in the sense that
f ◦ I = ¯f ,
(1.6)
and it assumes values in the punctured null quadric
A∗ =(cid:8)z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ Cn : z2
(1.7)
as seen from the nullity condition (1.2).

1 + z2

2 + ··· + z2

n = 0(cid:9) \ {0}

Conversely an I-invariant holomorphic map f : N → A∗ into the null quadric determines
a holomorphic 1-form Φ = f θ satisfying conditions (1.2) and (1.3), but not necessarily the
period condition (1.4).

The above discussion shows that the Weierstrass representation reduces the study of
conformal minimal immersions N → Rn from an open non-orientable conformal surface to
the study of I-invariant holomorphic maps f : N → A∗ from the 2-sheeted oriented cover
(N , I) of N = N /I into the punctured null quadric (1.7) such that the 1-form Φ = f θ
satisﬁes the period vanishing condition (1.4). (Here, θ can be any nowhere vanishing I-
invariant holomorphic 1-form on the Riemann surface N .) Indeed, the map X : N → Rn
given by (1.5) is then an I-invariant conformal minimal immersion, and hence it determines
a conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn. This is the main vantage point for our
analysis.

We are now ready for a more precise description of our main results.

1.3. Approximation and general position theorems. We begin with a Banach manifold
structure theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Banach manifolds of conformal minimal immersions). If N is a compact,
smoothly bounded, non-orientable surface with a conformal structure, then for any pair of
integers n ≥ 3 and r ≥ 1 the set of all conformal minimal immersions N → Rn of class
C r(N ) is a real analytic Banach manifold.

For a more precise result, see Theorem 3.14 and Corollary 3.15. The analogous
result in the orientable case is [13, Theorem 3.1 (b)]; see also [10, Theorem 3.2 (b)] for
the corresponding result concerning null curves and more general directed holomorphic
immersion N → Cn. In [13] we had to exclude ﬂat conformal minimal immersions, i.e.,
those whose image lies in an afﬁne 2-plane in Rn. This is unnecessary here since a non-
orientable surface does not immerse to R2, and hence every immersion to Rn for n > 2 is
nonﬂat.

It was shown in [38] that many natural spaces of holomorphic maps from a compact
strongly pseudoconvex Stein domain D to an arbitrary complex manifold Y carry the
structure of a complex Banach manifold. This holds in particular for the space A r(D, Y )

of holomorphic maps ˚D → Y which are smooth of class C r(D) up to the boundary for
some r ∈ Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. The proof relies on the construction of a tubular Stein
neighborhood of the graph of a given map in the product manifold D × Y , ﬁbered over the
base domain D. These results apply in particular to maps from bordered Riemann surfaces.
In the proof of Theorem 1.1 (see Subsec. 3.4) we proceed more directly. Consider the
oriented double cover (N , I) of N . We begin by showing that the space AI(N , A∗) of all
continuous I-invariant maps N → A∗ that are holomorphic in the interior ˚N = N \ bN
is a real analytic Banach submanifold of the real Banach space AI(N , Cn) of all maps
N → Cn of the same class. To see this, we apply the classical ideal theory for the algebra
A (N ) of continuous functions that are holomorphic in ˚N , adapted to I-invariant functions
(see Lemma 3.17), to show that the deﬁning equation f 2
n = 0 for AI(N , A∗) has
maximal rank whenever the component functions f1, . . . , fn have no common zeros; the
conclusion then follows by the implicit function theorem. Next, we use period dominating
I-invariant sprays (see Proposition 3.12) to show that the period vanishing equation (1.4)
is of maximal rank on AI(N , A∗), and hence it deﬁnes a Banach submanifold of ﬁnite
codimension. The same analysis applies to maps of class C r for any r ∈ Z+.

Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Runge and Mergelyan type approximation theorems
for conformal minimal immersions of non-orientable surfaces to Rn. A crucial point which
makes the approximation theory possible is that the punctured null quadric A∗ ⊂ Cn (1.7)
is an Oka manifold; see [11, Example 4.4]. In fact, A∗ is also a homogeneous space of the
complex Lie group C∗ ⊕ On(C), where On(C) is the orthogonal group over the complex
number ﬁeld C. For the theory of Oka manifolds, see the monograph [39] and the surveys
[42, 40].

Here we shall content ourselves by stating the following simpliﬁed version of Theorems
4.4 and 4.8. The latter results give approximation of generalized conformal minimal
immersions on admissible I-invariant Runge sets in N , including approximation on curves.
Theorem 1.2 (Runge approximation theorem for I-invariant conformal minimal immer-
sions). Let N be an open Riemann surface with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic in-
volution I : N → N , and let D ⋐ N be a relatively compact, smoothly bounded, I-
invariant domain (i.e., I(D) = D) which is Runge in N . Then, any I-invariant con-
formal minimal immersion X = (X1, . . . , Xn) : ¯D → Rn (n ≥ 3) of class C 1( ¯D) can
be approximated in the C 1( ¯D) topology by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions
eX = (eX1, . . . , eXn) : N → Rn.
functions on N , then we can choose eX as above such that eXj = Xj for j = 3, . . . , n.
Recall that a compact set K in an open Riemann surface N is said to be Runge (or
holomorphically convex) if any holomorphic function on a neighborhood of K can be
approximated, uniformly on K, by functions that are holomorphic on N . By classical
theorems of Runge [83] and Bishop [23], this holds if and only if the complement N \ K
has no connected component with compact closure.

By passing to the quotient N = N /I, Theorem 1.2 immediately gives the following

corollary. For the statement concerning embeddings, see Theorem 1.4.

Corollary 1.3 (Runge approximation theorem for non-orientable conformal minimal
surfaces). Assume that N is a non-orientable surface with a conformal structure and
D ⋐ N is a relatively compact domain with smooth boundary such that N \ ¯D has
no relatively compact connected components. Then every conformal minimal immersion
¯D → Rn (n ≥ 3) of class C 1( ¯D) can be approximated in the C 1( ¯D) topology by conformal
minimal immersions N → Rn (embeddings if n ≥ 5).

These approximation theorems are of crucial importance to the theory;

indeed, all

subsequent results presented in Sections 5 and 6 depend on them.

The case n = 3 of Theorem 1.2 is due to Alarc´on-L´opez [20]. For orientable surfaces, see
Alarc´on-L´opez [14] for n = 3 and Alarc´on-Fern´andez-L´opez [8] and Alarc´on-Forstneriˇc-
L´opez [13] for arbitrary dimension.

The second part of Theorem 1.2, where we ﬁx n − 2 components of the approximating
immersions, is very useful for the construction of non-orientable minimal surfaces with
global properties such as completeness of properness; we shall return to this subject later in
this introduction.

Theorem 1.2 is proved in a similar way as the corresponding result in the orientable case
(see [13, Theorem 5.3], and also [10, Theorem 7.2] for more general directed holomorphic
immersions); however, the details are considerably more involved in the non-orientable
case. The basic step in the proof is provided by Proposition 3.19 which gives approximation
of the I-invariant holomorphic map f = 2∂X/θ : ¯D → A∗ by a map with the same
properties deﬁned on the union of ¯D with an I-symmetric pair of bumps attached to ¯D.
This combines the method of approximation and gluing pairs of I-invariant sprays on a
very special I-invariant Cartan pair in N ; see Subsec. 3.2. Finitely many applications
of Proposition 3.19 complete the proof in the noncritical case; see Corollary 3.20. The
critical case amounts to passing an I-invariant pair of Morse critical points of a strongly
subharmonic I-invariant exhaustion function ρ : N → R; see the proof of Theorem 4.5 in
Subsec. 4.1. The geometrically different situations regarding the change of topology of the
sublevel set of ρ demand a considerably ﬁner analysis than in the orientable case. The last
part of Theorem 1.2, concerning approximation with ﬁxed n − 2 coordinates, is proved in
Subsec. 4.2; see the proof of Theorem 4.8.

In Section 5 we prove the following general position result for conformal minimal

immersions from non-orientable surfaces.

Theorem 1.4 (General position theorem). Let N be an open non-orientable surface
endowed with a conformal structure, and let X : N → Rn be a conformal minimal
immersion for some n ≥ 3.

If n ≥ 5 then X can be approximated uniformly on compacts by conformal minimal
embeddings eX : N ֒→ Rn. If n = 4 then X can be approximated uniformly on compacts
by conformal minimal immersions eX with simple double points.
The same results hold if N is a compact non-orientable conformal surface with smooth
boundary bN 6= ∅ and X is of class C r(N ) for some r ∈ N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}; in such case,
the approximation takes place in the C r(N ) topology. Furthermore, for every n ≥ 3 we can
approximate X by conformal minimal immersions eX : N → Rn such that eX : bN ֒→ Rn
is an embedding of the boundary.

Theorem 1.4 is a corollary to Theorem 5.1 which gives a general position result for
I-invariant conformal minimal immersions from Riemann surfaces to Rn. The proof
also shows that a generic conformal minimal immersion N → R4 has isolated normal
crossings. However, such double points are stable under small deformations, and it is
not clear whether one could remove them even by big deformations.
It is a major open
problem whether every (orientable or non-orientable) conformal surface admits a conformal
minimal embedding in R4. The corresponding problem is well known and widely open also
for holomorphic embeddings of Riemann surfaces [22]: does every open Riemann surface
embed holomorphically into C2? For a discussion of this subject and references to recent
results, see [13].

The analogue of Theorem 1.4 for orientable surfaces is [13, Theorem 1.1]; here we adapt
the proof to the non-orientable case. The main point is to prove a general position theorem
for conformal minimal immersions from compact bordered surfaces (see [13, Theorem 4.1]
for the orientable case; for embeddings on the boundary see also [6, Theorem 4.5 (a)]).
This is accomplished by transversality methods. The general case for an open surface is
obtained by a recursive procedure, using a suitable exhaustion by compact subdomains and
the Runge approximation theorem furnished by Theorem 1.2.

We now turn our attention to applications of the results presented thus far.

1.4. Complete non-orientable minimal surfaces with Jordan boundaries. In this
subsection, we focus on the existence of complete non-orientable minimal surfaces with
Jordan boundaries and their construction methods.

Douglas [31] and Rad´o [80] independently proved in 1931 that any Jordan curve in Rn
for n ≥ 3 bounds a minimal surface, thereby solving the so-called Plateau problem. By the
isoperimetric inequality, minimal surfaces in Rn spanning rectiﬁable Jordan curves are not
complete; it has been an open problem whether there exist (nonrectiﬁable) Jordan curves
whose solution to the Plateau problem is a complete minimal surface, or equivalently,
whether there are complete minimal surfaces in Rn bounded by Jordan curves. The ﬁrst
approach to the problem of existence of complete minimal surfaces with Jordan boundaries
was made in [72] for the case of disks in R3 (see also [4, 15, 19]). Finally, B. Drinovec
Drnovˇsek and the authors proved that every bordered Riemann surface is the underlying
conformal structure of a complete minimal surface bounded by Jordan curves (see [6,

10

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

Theorem 1.1]). We now give the analogous existence result for non-orientable minimal
surfaces.

Theorem 1.5 (Non-orientable complete minimal surfaces bounded by Jordan curves). Let
N be a compact non-orientable bordered surface with nonempty boundary bN 6= ∅,
endowed with a conformal structure, and let n ≥ 3 be an integer. Every conformal
minimal immersion X : N → Rn can be approximated uniformly on N by continuous maps
Y : N → Rn such that Y | ˚N : ˚N → Rn is a complete conformal minimal immersion and
Y |bN : bN → Rn is a topological embedding. In particular, the boundary Y (bN ) ⊂ Rn
consists of ﬁnitely many Jordan curves. If n ≥ 5 then there exist topological embeddings
Y : N ֒→ Rn with these properties.

Theorem 1.5 is a corollary to Theorem 6.6 in Subsec. 6.3 which furnishes a I-invariant
map Y : N → Rn with the analogous properties on a 2-sheeted oriented covering (N , I)
of N .

Theorem 1.5 gives the ﬁrst known examples of complete bounded non-orientable
minimal surfaces with Jordan boundaries.
It is related to the Calabi-Yau problem for
minimal surfaces, dating back to Calabi’s conjectures from 1966 [24] (see also Yau
[87, 88]), asking about the topological, geometric, and conformal properties of complete
bounded minimal surfaces. Earlier constructions of bounded complete (orientable or non-
orientable) minimal surfaces in Rn were based on classical Runge’s approximation theorem
applied on labyrinths of compact sets in the given surface N , at the cost of having to cut
away pieces of N in order to keep the image X(N ) ⊂ Rn suitably bounded. The original
construction of this type, with N the disk, is due to Nadirashvili [78]; the ﬁrst non-orientable
examples were given by L´opez, Mart´ın, and Morales in [70]. A fairly complete set of
references to subsequent works can be found in [6, 11, 12, 16].

The proof of Theorem 1.5, and of the related Theorem 6.6, uses approximate solutions
to a Riemann-Hilbert problem for I-invariant conformal minimal immersions; see Theorem
3.22. This method allows one to stretch a piece of the image X(N ) ⊂ Rn so as to increase
the immersion-induced boundary distance in N near a given arc in bN , while at the same
time controlling the placement of the whole surface in Rn. In this way, one avoids having
to cut away pieces of N during the construction, thereby obtaining results for any given
conformal structure on N .

The term Riemann-Hilbert problem classically refers to a family of free boundary value
problems for holomorphic maps and, by analogy, for certain other classes of maps. For
a brief historical background, especially in connection with the recent applications to the
theory of null curves and conformal minimal immersions, we refer to the survey by Alarc´on
and Forstneriˇc [12]. Let us explain this problem in the original complex analytic setting.

Assume that N is a compact bordered Riemann surface and Z : N → Cn is a
holomorphic map. (It sufﬁces that Z be of class A (N , Cn); also, the target Cn may be
replaced by an arbitrary complex manifold.) Let I ⊂ bN be a boundary arc. Consider a
continuous family of holomorphic disks Gp : D → Cn (p ∈ I) such that Gp(0) = Z(p) for

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

every p ∈ I. Let I ′ be a smaller arc contained in the relative interior of I, and let U ⊂ N
be a small open neighborhood of I ′ with U ∩ bN ⊂ I. Given this conﬁguration, one can
ﬁnd a holomorphic map eZ : N → Cn which is uniformly close to Z on N \ U, eZ(U ) is
close to Z(U ) ∪Sp∈I Gp(D), and the curve eZ(I ′) is close to the cylinderSp∈I ′ Gp(bD).
All approximations can be made as close as desired. A simple proof in the basic case when
N is the disk can be found in [41, Proposition 2.1] and in [35, Lemma 3.1]. The general
case is obtained by gluing sprays as explained in the proof of Theorem 3.22.

This method is quite versatile and can be used for several purposes. One of them is

case, one chooses the disks Gp such that for a given exhaustion function ρ on the target
manifold, the composition ρ ◦ Gp has a minimum at the center point 0 ∈ D and it satisﬁes
an estimate of the form ρ(Gp(ζ)) ≥ ρ(Gp(0)) + c|ζ|2 for some positive constant c > 0
independent of the point p ∈ I ′. This requires that ρ has a suitable convexity property
(more precisely, its Levi form should have at least two positive eigenvalues at every point).
The effect of the Riemann-Hilbert modiﬁcation is that we push the boundary points p ∈ I ′
in a controlled way to higher level sets of ρ without decreasing ρ much anywhere else along
the image of the surface. This is how Drinovec Drnovˇsek and Forstneriˇc [33] constructed
proper holomorphic maps from the interior of any given bordered Riemann surface to any
complex manifold satisfying a suitable q-convexity property. For a generalization to higher
dimensional source domains, see [34] and the references therein.

The Riemann-Hilbert method can also be used to construct bounded complete complex
curves in Cn for any n > 1. This is how Alarc´on and Forstneriˇc [9] found a proper
complete holomorphic immersion from the interior of any bordered Riemann surface to
the unit ball of C2. In this case, the holomorphic disks Gp are chosen to be linear, complex
orthogonal to the vector Z(p) ∈ Cn for each p ∈ I, and of uniform size ǫ > 0. In view of
Pythagoras’ theorem, the Riemann-Hilbert modiﬁcation increases the immersion-induced
boundary distance from an interior point of N to the arc I ′ by approximately ǫ, while at the
same time the outer radius of the immersion increases by at most Cǫ2 for some constant
C > 0. A recursive use of this technique on short boundary arcs, along with certain other
complex analytic tools, leads to the mentioned theorem.

Both these applications of the Riemann-Hilbert method have recently been extended to
the constructions of proper and/or complete null holomorphic curves in Cn and conformal
minimal surfaces in Rn for any n ≥ 3. The Riemann-Hilbert method was ﬁrst introduced
to the study of null curves in dimension n = 3 by Alarc´on and Forstneriˇc [11]. It was
improved and extended to constructions of complete bounded null curves and conformal
minimal immersions in any dimension n ≥ 3 in [6]. In the same paper, and before that in
[32], this method was also used to study minimal hulls and null hulls of compact sets in
Rn and Cn, respectively. The latter results are in the spirit of Poletsky’s theory of analytic
disk functionals; see [35] and the references therein. Finally, in [6, 5] the Riemann-Hilbert
method was used to construct complete proper conformal minimal immersions from an
arbitrary bordered Riemann surface to a certain class of domains in Rn.

In Subsec. 3.6 we extend the Riemann-Hilbert method to I-invariant conformal minimal
immersions N → Rn; see Theorem 3.22. The proof follows the orientable case (see
[6, Theorem 3.6]), using tools from Section 3 on approximation and gluing I-invariant
sprays. The key to the proof of Theorem 6.6 (which includes Theorem 1.5 as a corollary)
is to use the Riemann-Hilbert method on I-invariant pairs of short boundary arcs I =
I ′ ∪ I(I ′) ⊂ bN in order to increase the boundary distance from a ﬁxed interior point
p0 ∈ N to I by a prescribed amount by a deformation which is arbitrarily C 0 small on N . A
recursive application of this procedure yields a sequence of I-invariant conformal minimal
immersions Yj : N → Rn (j = 1, 2, . . .) converging uniformly on N to a continuous map
Y : N → Rn which is a complete conformal minimal immersion in the interior ˚N and
is a topological embedding (modulo I-invariance) of the boundary. By passing down to
N = N /I we obtain a map Y : N → Rn satisfying Theorem 1.5.
1.5. Proper non-orientable minimal surfaces in domains in Rn. We begin this
subsection with the following theorem summarizing several results from Subsec. 6.1 and
6.2 on the existence of complete conformal minimal immersions of arbitrary non-orientable
surfaces to Rn. The proofs rely upon the Runge-Mergelyan theorems in this setting; see
Theorems 1.2, 4.4 and 4.8.
Theorem 1.6 (Complete non-orientable conformal minimal surfaces in Rn). Let N be an
open non-orientable surface endowed with a conformal structure. The following assertions
hold for any n ≥ 3:
(i) Every conformal minimal immersion N → Rn can be approximated uniformly on
compacts by conformal minimal immersions N → Rn = R2 × Rn−2 properly
projecting into R2 (hence proper in Rn). If n ≥ 5, there exist approximating conformal
minimal embeddings with this property.

(X 1, . . . , X n) : K → Rn such that X j extends harmonically to N for j = 3, . . . , n
can be approximated uniformly on K by complete conformal minimal immersions

(ii) Let K be a compact set

Every conformal minimal

The case n = 3 of Theorem 1.6 is proved in [20]. More general versions are given by
Theorem 6.2 in Subsec. 6.1 (for part (i)) and Corollaries 6.4 and 6.5 in Subsec. 6.2 (for
parts (ii) and (iii), respectively). Analogous results are already known in the orientable
framework (see [14, 7, 8, 13]).

We wish to point out that part (i) in the theorem is in connection with an old conjecture by
Sullivan about the conformal type of properly immersed minimal surfaces in R3 with ﬁnite
topology, and also with a question of Schoen and Yau from 1985 about the conformal type
of minimal surfaces in R3 properly projecting into a plane (see [84, p. 18]). The number of

exceptional hyperplanes in part (iii) is sharp according to a result of Ahlfors [3]. We refer
to Section 6 for further references and motivation.

We also ﬁnd the ﬁrst known example of a properly embedded non-orientable minimal
surface (a minimal M¨obius strip) in R4; see Example 6.1. No such surfaces exist in R3 due
to topological reasons; a properly immersed minimal M¨obius strip in R3 with ﬁnite total
curvature was found by Meeks [73] back in 1981.

The last topic that we shall touch upon concerns the existence of proper (and complete
proper) conformal minimal immersions of non-orientable bordered surfaces to certain
classes of domains in Rn.

We recall the notion of a (strongly) p-plurisubharmonic function on a domain in Rn
and of a p-convex domain in Rn. This class of functions and domains have been studied
by Harvey and Lawson in [59]; see also [32, 56, 57, 58]. For more details and further
references, see Subsec. 6.4.

Let n ≥ 3 and p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. A smooth real function ρ on a domain D ⊂ Rn is
said to be (strongly) p-plurisubharmonic if for every point x ∈ D, the sum of the smallest
p eigenvalues of its Hessian Hessρ(x) at x is nonnegative (resp. positive). This holds if
and only if the restriction of ρ to any p-dimensional minimal submanifold is a subharmonic
function on that submanifold. Note that 1-plurisubharmonic functions are convex functions,
while n-plurisubharmonic functions are the usual subharmonic functions.

A domain D ⊂ Rn is said to be p-convex if it admits a smooth strongly p-
plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. A 1-convex domain is simply a convex domain,
while every domain in Rn is n-convex, i.e., it admits a strongly subharmonic exhaustion
function (see Greene and Wu [52] and Demailly [30]). A domain D with C 2 boundary is
p-convex if and only if

κ1(x) + ··· + κp(x) ≥ 0 for each point x ∈ bD,

where κ1(x) ≤ κ2(x) ≤ ··· ≤ κn−1(x) denote the normal curvatures of the boundary bD
at the point x with respect to the inner normal. The domain is said to be strongly p-convex
for some p ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} if it is smoothly bounded (of class C 2) and we have the strict
inequality κ1(x)+··· + κp(x) > 0 for each point x ∈ bD. Smooth (n− 1)-convex domains
in Rn are also called mean-convex, while 2-convex domains are called minimally convex (cf.
[32, 5]).

In Subsec. 6.4 we prove the following result which holds both for orientable and non-

orientable surfaces; see Theorem 6.8 for a more precise statement.

Theorem 1.7 (Proper non-orientable minimal surfaces in p-convex domains). Let N be a
compact bordered non-orientable surface. If D ⊂ Rn is a p-convex domain, where p = 2
if n = 3 and p = n − 2 if n > 3, then every conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn
satisfying X(N ) ⊂ D can be approximated uniformly on compacts in ˚N by complete
proper conformal minimal immersions ˚N → D. If the domain D is relatively compact,

14

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

smoothly bounded and strongly p-convex, then the approximating immersions can be chosen
to extend continuously to N .

The orientable case of Theorem 1.7 in dimension n = 3, with p = 2, is given by [5,
Theorem 1.1] (see also [5, Theorem 1.9] for boundary continuity of maps into strongly 2-
convex domains), while for n ≥ 4 and p = n − 2 it is stated as [5, Remark 3.8]. The result
is new for non-orientable surfaces.

It may be of interest to recall that any domain in R3 whose boundary is a properly
embedded minimal surface is a minimally convex domain (see [5, Corollary 1.3]); hence,
Theorem 1.7 applies to such domains. It is also worthwhile pointing out that, already in the
orientable case, the class of 2-convex domains in R3 is the biggest general class of domains
in R3 for which this result holds; see [5, Remark 1.11 and Examples 1.13, 1.14].

Theorem 1.7, and its counterpart in the orientable case, contributes to the problem
of determining which domains in Euclidean spaces admit complete properly immersed
minimal surfaces, and how the geometry of the domain inﬂuences the conformal properties
of such surfaces. We again refer to Section 6 for further references and motivation.

In conclusion, we brieﬂy describe the method of proof of Theorem 1.7; for details, see
the proof of Theorem 6.8. The major ingredient is the Riemann-Hilbert method described
in the previous subsection.

Let ρ : D → R be a smooth strongly p-plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Also,
let (N , I) be an oriented double-sheeted covering of N and X : N → D be the lifting
of X. We inductively construct a sequence of I-invariant conformal minimal immersions
Xj : N → D (j = 1, 2, . . .) which approximate X on a given compact subset of N and
converge uniformly on compacts in ˚N to a proper complete I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion eX = limj→∞ Xj : ˚N → D. If D is smoothly bounded and strongly p-convex
then the process is designed so that the convergence takes place in C 0(N , Rn). The induced
map eX : ˚N → D then satisﬁes the conclusion of Theorem 1.7.

The Riemann-Hilbert method is used in this recursive process in two different and

mutually independent ways:

(a) to push the boundary X(bN ) of the image surface closer to bD, and
(b) to increase the boundary distance in N induced by the immersion.
Both these applications of the Riemann-Hilbert method have been mentioned in the
previous subsection. The procedure (b) can be carried out by deformations that are C 0-
small on N , and hence it does not infringe upon the procedure (a); in the recursion, we
simply alternate them. This has already been exploited in the orientable case in the papers
[6, 5].

Part (b) has been explained in connection with the proof of Theorem 1.5.

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

15

The inductive step in procedure (a) uses the Riemann-Hilbert method to deform the
surface along a short boundary arc in the direction of a carefully selected family of
conformal minimal disks in D along which the function ρ increases quadratically. The
construction of such disks depends on the hypothesis that ρ is strongly p-plurisubharmonic;
see [5, Lemma 3.1] for the case p = 2, n = 3. We actually ﬁnd a corresponding family
of null holomorphic disks in the tube domain D × iRn ⊂ Cn over D by following the
(Here, i = √−1.)
standard complex analytic method of choosing so called Levi disks.
These are complex disks which are tangential to the level set of ρ at the center point and
such that the Levi form of ρ, considered as a function on D × iRn which is independent
of the imaginary component, is positive along these disk. These conditions ensure that ρ
increases quadratically along the disk. A minor complication arises at any critical point of
ρ, but it is well understood how to handle it by reducing to the noncritical case.

For more details, see Subsec. 6.4 and the paper [5].

2. PRELIMINARIES

We shall denote the complex coordinates on Cn by z = x + iy = (z1, . . . , zn), with

zj = xj + iyj. We denote by D = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} the unit disk in C and by

Bn = {z ∈ Cn : ||z||2 =

|zj|2 < 1} ⊂ Cn

nXj=1

the unit ball. Here, i = √−1.
Given a smooth surface N, we shall be considering smooth maps X : N → Rn and
Z = X + iY : N → Cn whose images are minimal surfaces in Rn or complex null
curves in Cn. Points of N will be denote by p, p0 and the like. By a compact domain
A ⊂ N , we mean a connected compact subset which is a topological surface with boundary.
Often N will be endowed with a conformal structure or, in the orientable case, with a
Riemann surface structure, and this will be emphasized by using instead the corresponding
caligraphic letter N .
2.1. Conformal structures on surfaces. Let N be a smooth connected non-orientable
surface. There is a smooth connected orientable surface N and a two-sheeted covering
map ι : N → N whose group of deck transformations is generated by a ﬁxed-point-
free orientation reversing involution I : N → N. The triple (N, I, ι) is unique up to an
isomorphism of covering spaces. Conversely, given a pair (N, I) as above, the quotient
N = N/I is a non-orientable surface whose orientable 2-sheeted covering space is N, and
the deck group is generated by the involution I.

A conformal structure on a surface N is determined by a choice of a Riemannian metric;
two metrics g, g′ on N determine the same conformal structure if and only if g′ = λg for
some function λ : N → (0,∞). We denote by N = (N, [g]) the surface with a choice
If N is a non-orientable surface and ι : N → N is as above,
of a conformal structure.

16

the pullback ι∗g of a Riemannian metric g on N is a Riemannian metric on N which,
together with a choice of orientation, determines the structure of a Riemann surface N .
In this complex structure, the involution I : N → N is antiholomorphic and the quotient
projection ι : N → N is conformal.

Equivalently, a conformal structure on a surface M is determined by a choice of an
atlas U = {(Ui, φi)}, where {Ui} is an open cover of M and φi : Ui → U ′
i ⊂ C
are homeomorphisms whose transition functions φi,j = φi ◦ φ−1
are holomorphic or
antiholomorphic on each connected component of their domain. If M is orientable then,
replacing φi by ¯φi if necessary, we obtain a complex atlas.
If M is non-orientable and
ι : N → M is a 2-sheeted oriented covering, then a conformal atlas U on M pulls back
to a conformal atlas V on N. Choosing an orientation on N and orienting each chart in
V accordingly gives a complex atlas, and N = (N, V ) is then a Riemann surface. The
quotient projection ι : N → M is either holomorphic or antiholomorphic in every pair of
charts from the respective atlases V , U .

In the sequel, objects related to a non-orientable surface N will be underlined, while the
corresponding objects related to the oriented 2-sheeted covering N will be denote by the
same letter but without underlining.

2.2. I-invariant functions and 1-forms. Spaces of functions and maps. Let N be an
open Riemann surface. A differential (1, 0)-form φ on N is given in any local holomorphic
coordinate z = x + iy by φ(z) = a(z)dz for some function a; φ is holomorphic if and
only if every coefﬁcient function a(z) obtained in this way is holomorphic. A (0, 1)-form
is locally of the form φ(z) = b(z)d¯z. The exterior differential splits as d = ∂ + ∂ where

We denote by O(N ) and Ω(N ) the spaces of all holomorphic functions and 1-forms on
N , respectively, endowed with the compact-open topology. If K is a compact set in N ,
then O(K) stands for the algebra of functions f : Uf → C that are holomorphic on open
neighborhoods Uf ⊃ K of K (depending on the function), in the sense of germs along K.
If K has boundary of class C 1 and k ≥ 0 is an integer then A k(K) denotes the space of
C k functions K → C that are holomorphic in the interior ˚K = K \ bK. We shall write
A 0(K) = A (K). We denote by

(2.1)

||f||0,K = sup{|f (p)| : p ∈ K}

the supremum norm of a function f in any of the spaces O(K) or A k(K).

Given a complex manifold Z, we denote the corresponding space of maps to Z by

O(N , Z), O(K, Z), and A k(K, Z). For f = (f1, . . . , fn) ∈ A (K, Cn) we set

If f : K × V → Z is a map on the product K × V of a compact set K ⊂ N and an open set
V ⊂ Cm for some m, we shall say that f is of class A (K) (or A (K × V, Z) when we wish
to emphasize the sets V and Z) if f is continuous on K × V and holomorphic on ˚K × V .
Deﬁnition 2.1 (I-invariant maps and 1-forms). Let (N , I) be a Riemann surface with a
ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic involution I : N → N .

(a) A map X : N → Rn is I-invariant if

(b) A holomorphic map f : N → Cn is I-invariant if

and is I-skew-invariant if f ◦ I = − ¯f .

(c) A holomorphic (or meromorphic) 1-form φ on N is I-invariant if

X ◦ I = X.

f ◦ I = ¯f ,

I∗φ = ¯φ.

Note that a function f = u + iv ∈ O(N ) is I-invariant if and only if u, v : N → R are

conjugate harmonic functions satisfying

Thus, the real part u = ℜf is I-invariant while the imaginary part v = ℑf is I-skew-
invariant. We introduce the following notation:

u ◦ I = u,

v ◦ I = −v.

OI(N ) = {f ∈ O(N ) : f ◦ I = ¯f}.

OI(N ) ∩ iOI(N ) = {0}

Note that iOI(N ) = {if : f ∈ OI(N )} = {f ∈ O(N ) : f ◦ I = − ¯f} and that OI(N ) and
iOI(N ) are real Fr´echet algebras such that
(2.2)
and O(N ) = OI(N ) ⊕ iOI(N ),
with projections ΠI : O(N ) → OI(N ), Π¯I : O(N ) → iOI(N ) given by

These projections satisfy ker ΠI = iOI(N ) and ker Π¯I = OI(N ).

By ΩI(N ) we denote the space of all I-invariant holomorphic 1-forms on N with the
compact-open topology. Note that ΩI(N ) is an OI(N )-module. The following lemma
summarizes connections between I-invariant functions and 1-forms.
Lemma 2.2. Let (N , I) be a connected open Riemann surface with a ﬁxed-point-free
antiholomorphic involution.
If u : N → R is a I-invariant harmonic function (i.e.,
u ◦ I = u), then ∂u ∈ ΩI(N ) is a I-invariant holomorphic 1-form: I∗(∂u) = ∂u.
Conversely, assume that φ ∈ ΩI(N ). Pick a point p0 ∈ N and a number a ∈ R. Then the
following hold:

is holomorphic and I-invariant (f ∈ OI(N )) and df = ∂f = φ.

Proof. Assume that u is a I-invariant real harmonic function. Then

I∗∂u + I∗∂u = I∗du = d(u ◦ I) = du = ∂u + ∂u = ∂u + ∂u.

Since I is antiholomorphic, the 1-form I∗∂u is of type (0, 1) while I∗∂u is of type (1, 0).
It follows that I∗∂u = ∂u as claimed.

Assume that φ ∈ ΩI(N ). Fix a point p ∈ N and choose a path γ : [0, 1] → N connecting
p = γ(0) to I(p) = γ(1). The path I∗γ then connects I(p) back to p, and λ = γ ∪ I∗γ is a
loop based at p. We have that

φ =Zγ

¯φ = 2Zγ ℜφ.

If the real periods of φ vanish then 2Rγ ℜφ = Rλ φ = 0 and hence u = R ℜφ satisﬁes
u(I(p)) = u(p) +Rγ ℜφ = u(p), so it is I-invariant. The integral f =R φ = u + iv is well
deﬁned and holomorphic on any simply connected domain in N , and the Cauchy-Riemann
equations yield φ = df = ∂f = 2∂u. This proves (a).

Assume now that φ has vanishing complex periods and let f be as in part (b). Then,
ℜf = u is the I-invariant harmonic function in part (a). Furthermore, the function
g = f ◦ I is holomorphic and satisﬁes ℜg = ℜf ◦ I = ℜf . A calculation shows that
ℑf (p0) = ℑg(p0); hence, f = g = f ◦ I by the identity principle.

(cid:3)

Let u be a smooth real function on N . Its conjugate differential is deﬁned by

(2.4)
In any local holomorphic coordinate z = x + iy on N we have dcu = − ∂u
Note that

dcu = i(∂u − ∂u) = 2ℑ(∂u).

∂y dx + ∂u

∂x dy.

2∂u = du + idcu and ddcu = 2i ∂∂u = ∆u· dx ∧ dy.

Hence, u is harmonic if and only if dcu is a closed 1-form, and in this case we have dcu = dv
for any local harmonic conjugate v of u.

The ﬂux of a harmonic function u is the homomorphism Fluxu : H1(N ; Z) → R on the

ﬁrst homology group of N given by
Fluxu(γ) =Zγ
(2.5)

dcu = 2Zγ ℑ(∂u),

[γ] ∈ H1(N ; Z).

A harmonic function u admits a harmonic conjugate on N if and only if Fluxu = 0. If φ is
a holomorphic I-invariant 1-form on N and γ is a smooth arc or a closed curve, then

Applying this formula to φ = ∂u, where u is a I-invariant harmonic function on N , we get
for any closed curve γ in N that
(2.7)

Fluxu(I∗γ) = 2ZI∗γ ℑ(∂u) = −2Zγ ℑ(∂u) = −Fluxu(γ).

We shall need the following result of Alarc´on and L´opez; the standard version without

I-invariance is due to Gunning and Narasimhan [54].
Proposition 2.3 (Corollary 6.5 in [20]). Every open Riemann surface N carrying an anti-
holomorphic involution I : N → N without ﬁxed points admits a I-invariant holomorphic
function f ∈ OI(N ) with no critical points. In particular, the differential df = ∂f of such
function is a nowhere vanishing I-invariant holomorphic 1-form on N .
2.3. Homology basis and period map. Given a non-orientable open surface N with ﬁnite
topology, we shall give an explicit geometric description of its two-sheeted orientable
covering (N, I), and we will ﬁnd a homology basis B for H1(N ; Z) whose support |B|
satisﬁes I(|B|) = |B| and such that N\|B| has no relatively compact connected components
in N. For background on topology of surfaces, see e.g. [60, Chapter 9].

Every closed non-orientable surface M is the connected sum M = P2 ♯··· ♯ P2 of g ≥ 1
copies of the real projective plane P2; the number g is the genus of M. (This is the maximal
number of pairwise disjoint closed curves in M which reverse the orientation.) Furthermore,
K = P2 ♯ P2 is the Klein bottle, and for any compact non-orientable surface M we have
that M ♯ K = M ♯ T where T is the torus. This gives the following dichotomy according to
whether the genus g is even or odd:

(I) g = 1 + 2k ≥ 1 is odd. In this case, M = P2 ♯

the projective plane P2.

(II) g = 2 + 2k ≥ 2 is even. In this case, M = K ♯

the Klein bottle K = P2 ♯ P2.

the geometric description of the oriented double covering ι : N → N is analogous to the
previous case. Let {qj, I(qj)} = ι−1(pj) (j = 1, . . . , r). Set

N = M \ {q1, . . . , qr, I(q1), . . . , I(qr)}

and restrict the involution I to N. Without loss of generality we can suppose that
q1, . . . , qr ∈ M − and I(q1), . . . , I(qr) ∈ M +. Set

N − := N ∩ M − = M − \ {q1, . . . , qr},
N + := N ∩ M + = M − \ {I(q1), . . . , I(qr)}.

A similar description holds if we remove from M pairwise disjoint disks (instead of points)
to get a compact non-orientable surface with smooth boundary.

Note that the curve β−
0 is homologically independent from the other curves in B due to the
presence of the holes {qr, I(qr)}, but small curves around these two holes are homologically
dependent on the curves in B.

A basis B as in (2.8) and (2.9) will be called a I-basis of H1(N ; Z).

Remark 2.4. If S is an I-invariant compact subset of N which is a strong deformation
retract of N, we may ﬁnd an I-basis B of H1(N ; Z) with support |B| ⊂ S. Obviously, B is
a basis of H1(S; Z). We will say that B is an I-basis of S.

A period map. Assume now that the surface N carries a conformal structure, so we
denote it by N . Its 2-sheeted orientable covering N is then a Riemann surface and the deck
map I : N → N is an antiholomorphic involution. Since N has ﬁnite topological type,
a theorem of Stout [85, Theorem 8.1] shows that it is obtained by removing ﬁnitely many
pairwise disjoint points and closed disks from a compact Riemann surface. However, from
the topological point of view we need not distinguish between removing disks and points,
and the condition that the homology basis B (2.8), (2.9) for H1(N ; Z) be Runge in N is
independent of the choice of the conformal structure.

Write B = B+ ∪ B− where B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} and B− = {I(δ2), . . . , I(δl)} denote the

following collections of curves (the curves β±

I-invariant 1-forms the symmetry conditions (2.6) imply that P completely determines the

Lemma 2.5. Let φ be a I-invariant holomorphic 1-form on N . Then:

(a) φ is exact if and only if P(φ) = 0.
(b) The real part ℜφ is exact if and only if ℜP(φ) = 0.

Proof. By (2.6) we have that

j = 1, . . . , l.

Therefore, P(φ) = 0 implies that φ has vanishing periods over all curves in the homology
basis B = B+ ∪ B− given by (2.8) or (2.9), and hence is exact. The converse is obvious.
Likewise, ℜP(φ) = 0 implies that ℜφ has vanishing periods over all curves in B and hence
is exact. However, the imaginary periods ℑP(φ) (the ﬂux of φ) can be arbitrary subject
to the conditions (2.7): RI∗δj ℑφ = −Rδj ℑφ for j = 1, . . . , l.
In particular, we have
Rδ1 ℑφ = 0 since I∗δ1 = δ1.

2.4. Conformal minimal immersions of non-orientable surfaces. We recall the notion
of Weierstrass representation of a conformal minimal immersion. For the orientable case
we refer to Osserman [79]; the non-orientable case has been treated, for instance, in [73, 20].
Let n ≥ 3 be an integer and N be an open Riemann surface or a compact bordered
Riemann surface. An immersion X : N → Rn is said to be conformal if it preserves
angles. In a local holomorphic coordinate z = x + iy on N this is equivalent to asking that
the partial derivatives Xx = ∂X/∂x and Xy = ∂X/∂y of X are orthogonal to each other
and have the same length:

(cid:3)

(2.13)
(We always use the standard Euclidean metric on Rn.) Let us write

|Xx| = |Xy| > 0.

Xx· Xy = 0,

∂X = Φ = (φ1, . . . , φn) with φj = ∂Xj for j = 1, . . . , n.

(2.14)
From 2∂X = (Xx − iXy)dz we obtain
(φ1)2 + (φ2)2 + ··· + (φn)2 =

1

4(cid:0)|Xx|2 − |Xy|2 − 2iXx· Xy(cid:1) (dz)2.

A comparison with (2.13) shows that X is conformal if and only if
(2.15)

(φ1)2 + (φ2)2 + ··· + (φn)2 = 0.

An immersion X : N → Rn is minimal if its mean curvature vector vanishes identically.
It is
By Meusnier, this holds if and only if the image of X is locally area minimizing.
classical (see e.g. [79, Lemma 4.2, p. 29]) that a smooth conformal immersion X : N → Rn

we see that a smooth conformal immersion X is minimal if and only if the (1, 0)-differential
∂X = Φ (2.14) is a holomorphic 1-form satisfying the nullity condition (2.15). Note that
dX = 2ℜ(∂X) = 2ℜΦ and hence the real periods of Φ vanish:
(2.16)

Φ = 0 for every closed path γ in N .

The periods of the imaginary part 2ℑΦ = dcX (the conjugate differential of X, see (2.4))
deﬁne the ﬂux homomorphism (cf. (2.5) for the scalar case):

FluxX : H1(N ; Z) → Rn,

FluxX (γ) = 2Zγ ℑΦ.

If FluxX = 0 then the map Z = X + iY : N → Cn, deﬁned by Z(p) =R p Φ (p ∈ N ),
is a holomorphic null immersion with Φ = dZ = ∂Z = 2 ∂X = 2i ∂Y. In this case, X
is said to be ﬂux-vanishing and the associated family of conformal minimal immersions
X t := ℜ(eitZ) : N → Rn, t ∈ [0, 2π), is well deﬁned.

Denote by π : Cn \ {0} → CPn−1 the canonical projection onto the projective space, so
π(z1, . . . , zn) = [z1 : ··· : zn] are homogeneous coordinates on CPn−1. Since the 1-form
∂X = Φ = (φ1, . . . , φn) (2.14) does not vanish anywhere on N (see the last equation in
(2.13)), it determines a holomorphic map

(2.17)

N −→ CPn−1,

p 7−→ [φ1(p) : φ2(p) : ··· : φn(p)]

of Kodaira type, called the generalized Gauss map of X. By (2.15), this map assumes values
in the projection of A∗ = A \ {0} in CPn−1 (a smooth quadratic complex hypersurface in
CPn−1), where A is the null quadric

(2.18)

A = {z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈ Cn : z2

n = 0}.

Conversely, given a nowhere vanishing holomorphic 1-form Φ = (φ1, . . . , φn) on N
satisfying the nullity condition (2.15) and with vanishing real periods (2.16), the map
X : N → Rn deﬁned by
(2.19)

ℜ(Φ) ∈ Rn,

p ∈ N

X(p) = 2Z p

is a conformal minimal immersion with ∂X = Φ.

Let θ be a nowhere vanishing holomorphic 1-form on N (see [54]). Clearly, a
holomorphic 1-form Φ = (φ1, . . . , φn) satisﬁes the nullity condition (2.15) if and only
if the map f = Φ/θ : N → Cn assumes values in the null quadric A (2.18). This
reduces the construction of conformal minimal immersions N → Rn to the construction
of holomorphic maps f : N → A∗ such that the holomorphic 1-form f θ has vanishing real
periods over all closed curves in N .
Φ =(cid:18) 1

If n = 3 and φ1 6≡ iφ2, the triple Φ = (φ1, φ2, φ3) can be written in the form

Here, g is a meromorphic function on N whose zeroes and poles coincide with the zeroes of
φ3, with the same order. Moreover, g agrees with the stereographic projection of the Gauss
map N → S2 of X (see [79]); this is why g is called the (complex) Gauss map of X. The
pair (g, φ3) is known in the literature as the Weierstrass data of X. Writing φ3 = f3θ where

(2.21)

This classical formula has been the main tool in the construction of minimal surfaces in
R3 over the past half-century.
It has allowed to give explicit examples by pointing out
Riemann surfaces, pairs (g, f3), and nowhere vanishing holomorphic 1-forms θ such that
the resulting vectorial 1-form f θ, where f is given by (2.21), has vanishing real periods
(see e.g. [79, 25, 29, 62] for examples of complete conformal minimal surfaces of ﬁnite
total curvature). This representation formula has also been fundamental in the global
theory of minimal surfaces and was exploited in the proof of general existence results of
complete minimal surfaces in R3. L´opez and Ros observed in [71] that if (g, f3θ) are
the Weierstrass data of a conformal minimal immersion on a Riemann surface N and
h : N → C \ {0} is a holomorphic function, then the pair (hg, f3θ) also furnishes a
conformal minimal immersion provided that the period vanishing condition is satisﬁed.
Combining this simple transformation with Runge’s approximation theorem [83] has been
the key in the construction of complete bounded minimal surfaces (see [64, 78] and the
discussion of the Calabi-Yau problem in Subsec. 1.4 and 6.3), and of properly immersed
minimal surfaces in R3 with hyperbolic conformal type (see [77, 14] and the discussion
of the Sullivan conjecture and the Schoen-Yau problem in Subsec. 6.2 and 6.1). An
analogue of the formula (2.21) is not available in higher dimensions, and hence constructing
holomorphic maps N → A∗ ⊂ Cn for n > 3 requires a different approach presented in this
paper.

To treat the problem on a non-orientable surface N , let ι : N → N be a 2-sheeted
oriented covering by a Riemann surface N with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic
involution I : N → N (see Subsec. 2.1). For every conformal minimal immersion
X : N → Rn, the composition X = X ◦ ι : N → Rn is a I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion; conversely, a I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn passes
down to a conformal minimal immersion X = (X 1, . . . , X n) : N → Rn.

By Lemma 2.2, every I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn is of the
form (2.19) where Φ = (φ1, . . . , φn) is a holomorphic 1-form on N that is I-invariant
(I∗Φ = Φ), it satisﬁes the nullity condition (2.15), and has vanishing real periods (2.16).
Furthermore, any such Φ is of the form Φ = f θ where θ is a nowhere vanishing I-invariant
1-form furnished by Proposition 2.3 and f = (f1, . . . , fn) : N → A∗ is an I-invariant
holomorphic map (satisfying f ◦ I = ¯f) such thatRγ ℜ(f θ) = 0 for every closed loop γ in
N .
If n = 3 then φ1 6≡ iφ2 holds (otherwise Φ ≡ 0 by the I-invariancy of Φ), and the

meromorphic Gauss map g given by (2.20) satisﬁes the symmetry

(2.22)

g ◦ I = −

Similarly to the orientable case, any pair (g, f3) where g is a meromorphic function on
N satisfying (2.22) and f3 : N → C is an I-invariant holomorphic function such that the
zeroes of f3 coincide with the zeroes and poles of g, with the same order, furnishes an
I-invariant holomorphic function f : N → A∗ ⊂ C3 by the Weierstrass formula (2.21).
Most examples of non-orientable minimal surfaces in R3 given in the last ﬁve decades
rely on these formulas; see for instance [73, 65, 68] for some explicit complete examples
of ﬁnite total curvature, and [67, 70, 37, 20] for constructions exploiting the L´opez-Ros
transformation and Runge’s theorem.

Constructing I-invariant holomorphic functions N → A∗ ⊂ Cn for n > 3 is a much

more involved task.

Let us illustrate these notions on the following well known example of Meeks [73,
Theorem 2]. See also Example 6.1 in Subsec. 6.1 which gives a properly embedded minimal
M¨obius strip in R4.
Example 2.6 (Meeks’s minimal M¨obius strip in R3). Let N = C∗ := C \ {0}, and let
I : C∗ → C∗ be the ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic involution given by

Observe that f3 is holomorphic and I-invariant whereas g is meromorphic and satisﬁes
the symmetry condition (2.22). Since the zeroes of f3 coincide with the zeroes and poles
of g with the same order, the pair (g, f3) determines an I-invariant holomorphic map
f : C∗ → A∗ ⊂ C3 by the Weierstrass formula (2.21). Moreover, it is easily seen that
the holomorphic 1-form Φ = f θ is exact on C∗ and hence determines a ﬂux-vanishing I-
invariant conformal minimal immersion X : C∗ → R3 by the expression (2.19). Therefore,
X induces a conformal minimal immersion X : C∗/I → R3. This is Meeks’s complete
immersed minimal M¨obius strip in R3 with ﬁnite total curvature −6π. See Figure 2.3. (cid:3)
Assume now that the Riemann surface N has ﬁnite topology. Let B be a homology basis
given by (2.8), (2.9), and let B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} ⊂ B be given by (2.10). Fix a nowhere
vanishing 1-form θ ∈ ΩI(N ) without zeros. Given these choices, let

3. GLUING I-INVARIANT SPRAYS AND APPLICATIONS

In this subsection, we develop the complex analytic methods that will be used in the
paper. They originate in modern Oka theory (cf. [39, Chapter 5]) and have already been
exploited in the construction of conformal minimal immersions from Riemann surfaces; see
[6, 10, 11, 13]. Here we adapt them to Riemann surfaces endowed with a ﬁxed-point-free
antiholomorphic involution I.

The main new technical results include Proposition 3.7 on gluing pairs of I-invariant
sprays, and Proposition 3.12 on the existence of I-invariant period dominating sprays.
In Subsec. 3.4 we use Proposition 3.12 to show that the set of all conformal minimal
immersions from a compact bordered non-orientable surface is a real analytic Banach
manifold. These techniques are applied in Subsec. 3.5 to obtain basic approximation
results for I-invariant conformal minimal immersions which are in turn used in the
proof of Mergelyan approximation theorems for conformal minimal immersions from non-
orientable surfaces to Rn (cf. Theorems 4.4 and 4.8). The gluing techniques are also used in
Subsec. 3.6 to ﬁnd approximate solutions of certain Riemann-Hilbert type boundary value
problems for I-invariant conformal minimal immersions, generalizing what has been done
in the orientable case in [6, 11]. The Riemann-Hilbert method is an essential tool in the
construction of complete non-orientable minimal surfaces in Section 6.

For any n ∈ N we denote by I0 the antiholomorphic involution on Cn given by complex
conjugation: I0(z) = ¯z. Note that OI0(Cn) = {f ∈ O(Cn) : f ◦ I0 = ¯f} is the algebra of
all entire functions f (z) =P cαzα with real coefﬁcients cα ∈ R.

3.1. I-invariant sprays.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26), and let Z be a locally closed I0-
invariant complex submanifold of a complex Euclidean space Cn. A spray of maps N → Z
of class OI,I0(N ) is a holomorphic map F : N × U → Z, where U ⊂ Cm is an open I0-
invariant neighborhood of the origin in Cm for some m ∈ N, which is (I, I0)-invariant in
the following sense:

F (I(p), ¯ζ) = F (p, ζ),

(3.1)
We shall also write F ∈ OI,I0(N × U, Z).
Lemma 3.2. If F : N × U → Z is a (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic spray and α : N → U
is a I-invariant holomorphic map, then N ∋ p 7→ F (p, α(p)) ∈ Z is a I-invariant
holomorphic map. In particular, F (· , ζ) : N → Z is I-invariant when ζ ∈ Rm ∩ U is
real.

p ∈ N , ζ ∈ U.

Proof. This follows from F (I(p), α(I(p))) = F (I(p), α(p)) = F (p, α(p)).
Example 3.3. 1. If f : N → Cn is a I-invariant holomorphic map (i.e., f ◦ I = ¯f) and
g : Cm → Cn is a holomorphic map sending Rm (the real subspace of Cm) into Rn, then the
holomorphic map F : N × Cm → Cn given by F (p, ζ) = f (p) + g(ζ) is (I, I0)-invariant.
2. Assume that V = Pn
is a holomorphic vector ﬁeld on Cn whose
coefﬁcients aj(z) have real values on Rn ⊂ Cn. The ﬂow φt(z) of V then preserves
the real subspace Rn for all t ∈ R, and hence it satisﬁes the condition
(3.2)

j=1 aj(z) ∂
∂zj

(cid:3)

φ¯t(¯z) = φt(z)

for all points (z, t) in the fundamental domain of V . In particular, if V is complete then
{φt}t∈R ⊂ OI0(Cn, Cn) is a 1-parameter group of I0-invariant automorphisms of Cn.
Given a I-invariant holomorphic map f : N → Cn, the map (p, t) 7→ φt(f (p)) is (I, I0)-
invariant on a neighborhood of N × {0} in N × C by Lemma 3.2.
Recall that a subset A ⊂ N is said to be I-invariant if I(A) = A.

Deﬁnition 3.4. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26), let A be a compact I-invariant domain
in N , and let Z ⊂ Cn be a locally closed I0-invariant complex submanifold of Cn. A
spray of maps of class AI,I0(A) with values in Z is a continuous (I, I0)-invariant map
F : A × U → Z (see (3.1)) that is holomorphic on ˚A × U, where U ⊂ Cm is an open I0-
invariant neighborhood of the origin in some Cm. We shall also write F ∈ AI,I0(A×U, Z).
The map f = F (· , 0) : A → Z is called the core of F . The spray F is dominating over a
subset C ⊂ A if its vertical differential
(3.3)
is surjective for every point p ∈ C; F is dominating if this holds on C = A.

Holomorphic sprays were introduced into Oka theory by Gromov [53], although special
cases have already been used by Grauert in his proof of the Oka-Grauert principle [49, 50].
See [39] for a more comprehensive account of the use of sprays in complex analysis.

The following type of sprays will be of main importance to us.

Example 3.5 (Sprays deﬁned by vector ﬁelds). Assume that Z is a locally closed I0-
invariant complex submanifold of Cn. Let V1, . . . , Vm be entire vector ﬁelds on Cn which
are tangent to Z and whose coefﬁcients are real on Rn. The ﬂow φj
t (z) of Vj then satisﬁes
condition (3.2). Given a compact I-invariant domain A ⊂ N and a I-invariant map
f : A → Z of class A (A), there is an r > 0 such that the map F : A × rBm → Cn
given by

F (p, t1, . . . , tm) = φ1

(3.4)
is well deﬁned for all t = (t1, . . . , tm) ∈ rBm; we can take r = +∞ if the vector ﬁelds Vj
are complete. Cleary, F is a (I, I0)-invariant spray of class AI,I0(A) with values in Z and
with the core f . (Compare with Example 3.3.) From

p ∈ A,

t1 ◦ φ2

t2 ◦ ··· ◦ φm

tm(f (p)),

F (p, t) = Vj(f (p))

for j = 1, . . . , m

∂

∂tj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

∂

∂tj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

we see that the spray F is dominating on A if and only if the vectors V1(z), . . . , Vm(z) span
the tangent space TzZ at every point z = f (p), p ∈ A.

More generally, if h1, . . . , hm ∈ OI(A) then the map F : A × Cm → Cn,
tmhm(p)(f (p)),

F (p, t1, . . . , tm) = φ1

t1h1(p) ◦ φ2

t2h2(p) ◦ ··· ◦ φm

(3.5)

is a (I, I0)-invariant spray with values in Z satisfying

F (p, t) = hj(p) Vj(f (p))

for j = 1, . . . , m.

Hence, F is dominating at every point p ∈ A where hj(p) 6= 0 for all j = 1, . . . , m and the
vectors V1(f (p)), . . . , Vm(f (p)) span Tf (p)Z.

The most relevant case for us is Z = A∗ = A \ {0}, where A ⊂ Cn is the null quadric

(2.18). The linear holomorphic vector ﬁelds

are C-complete, their coefﬁcients are real on Rn, they are tangent to A∗, and they span the
tangent space TzA∗ at each point z ∈ A∗.

3.2. Gluing I-invariant sprays on I-invariant Cartan pairs.
Deﬁnition 3.6 (I-invariant Cartan pairs). Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26). A pair
(A, B) of compact sets in N is said to be a I-invariant Cartan pair if the following
conditions hold:

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

31

(a) the sets A, B, A ∩ B and A ∪ B are I-invariant with C 1 boundaries;
(b) A \ B ∩ B \ A = ∅ (the separation property).

A I-invariant Cartan pair (A, B) is special if B = B′ ∪ I(B′), where B′ is a compact set
with C 1 boundary in N and B′ ∩ I(B′) = ∅.

A special Cartan pair (A, B) is very special if the sets B′ and A ∩ B′ are disks (hence,

I(B′) and A ∩ I(B′) are also disks). See Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. A very special Cartan pair.

The following is one of our main technical tools in the construction of I-invariant
conformal minimal immersions. The corresponding gluing lemma in several variables
(without I-invariance) is given by [39, Proposition 5.9.2, p. 216].
Proposition 3.7 (Gluing pairs of I-invariant sprays). Assume that (N , I) is a standard pair
(2.26), (A, B) is a special I-invariant Cartan pair in N , Z is a locally closed I0-invariant
complex submanifold of Cn (where I0(z) = ¯z is the conjugation on Cn), r > 0 is a real
number, and F : A×rBm → Z is a spray of class AI,I0(A) which is dominating over the set
C = A∩B. Then, there is a number r′ ∈ (0, r) depending on F with the following property.
For every ǫ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that, given a spray G : B × rBm → Z of class
AI,I0(B) satisfying ||F − G||0,C×rBm < δ, there exists a spray H : (A ∪ B) × r′Bm → Z
of class AI,I0(A ∪ B) satisfying ||H − F||0,A×r′ Bm < ǫ.

The main step in the proof of Proposition 3.7 is the following splitting lemma. See [39,
Proposition 5.8.1, p. 211] for a more general geometric setting. The new aspect here is
I-invariance.
Lemma 3.8 (A splitting lemma for I-invariant maps). Assume that (N , I) and (A, B) are
as in Proposition 3.7, and let C = A ∩ B. Given numbers ǫ > 0 and 0 < r2 < r1, there
exists a number δ > 0 with the following property. Let γ : C × r1Bm → C × Cm be a map
of the form

(3.7)

γ(p, ζ) =(cid:0)p, ζ + c(p, ζ)(cid:1),

p ∈ C, ζ ∈ r1Bm,

32

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

where c ∈ AI,I0(C × r1Bm, Cm) satisﬁes ||c||0,C×r1 Bm < δ. Then there exist maps

α : A × r2Bm −→ A × Cm,

β : B × r2Bm −→ B × Cm

of the form

α(p, ζ) = (p, ζ + a(p, ζ)) ,

(3.8)
where the maps a ∈ AI,I0(A × r2Bm, Cm) and b ∈ AI,I0(B × r2Bm, Cm) are uniformly
ǫ-close to 0 on their respective domains, such that

β(p, ζ) = (p, ζ + b(p, ζ)) ,

(3.9)

γ ◦ α = β holds on C × r2Bm.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of [39, Proposition 5.8.1]. We begin by considering the
following Cousin-I problem: given a (I, I0)-invariant map c : C × r1Bm → Cm of class
A (C × r1Bm), we claim that it splits as a difference
(3.10)
c = b − a,
where a : A × r1Bm → Cm and b : B × r1Bm → Cm are (I, I0)-invariant maps of class
A (A × r1Bm) and A (B × r1Bm), respectively, satisfying the estimates
(3.11)

||a||0,A×r1 Bm ≤ M||c||0,C×r1 Bm,

||b||0,B×r1 Bm ≤ M||c||0,C×r1 Bm

for some constant M > 0 depending only on the pair (A, B). In particular, a and b are
uniformly ǫ-close to 0 on their respective domains provided that ||c||0,C×r1 Bm is sufﬁciently
small. To ﬁnd such splitting, we ﬁrst solve the standard Cousin-I problem to ﬁnd maps a′
and b′ as above (not necessarily (I, I0)-invariant) satisfying c = b′−a′ on C×r1Bm and the
estimates (3.11). This is classical and uses a bounded solution operator for the ∂-equation
on A ∪ B; the variable ζ ∈ r1Bm plays the role of a parameter. Since c is (I, I0)-invariant
and hence satisﬁes

c(p, ζ) =

1

2(cid:16)c(p, ζ) + c(I(p), ¯ζ )(cid:17) ,

it follows that the (I, I0)-invariant Cm-valued maps

p ∈ C, ζ ∈ r1Bm,
2(cid:16)b′(p, ζ) + b′(I(p), ¯ζ)(cid:17) ,
deﬁned for p ∈ A and p ∈ B, respectively, satisfy (3.10) and the estimates (3.11).

2(cid:16)a′(p, ζ) + a′(I(p), ¯ζ)(cid:17) ,

a(p, ζ) =

b(p, ζ) =

By using this Cousin-I problem, the proof is then completed by an iterative process
exactly as in [33, proof of Theorem 3.2]. (One can also apply the implicit function theorem
approach, cf. [39, proof of Proposition 5.8.1].) It is easily seen (cf. Lemma 3.2) that the
composition α1 ◦ α2 of two maps of type (3.8) is still of the same type; in particular, its
second component is (I, I0)-invariant if this holds for α1 and α2. Hence, the maps α and
β obtained in the limit have (I, I0)-invariant second components.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 3.7. We claim that there is a number r1 ∈ (0, r), depending only on
F , such that the following holds. Assuming that ||F − G||0,C×rBm is small enough, there

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

33

is a map γ : C × r1Bm → C × rBm of class A (C × r1Bm) and of the form (3.7), with
(I, I0)-invariant second component, satisfying an estimate

(3.12)

||γ − Id||0,C×r1Bm ≤ const·||F − G||0,C×rBm

(with a constant independent of G) and the identity

(3.13)

F = G ◦ γ

on C × r1Bm.

Without the (I, I0)-invariance condition, such transition map γ is furnished by [39, Lemma
5.9.3, p. 216]. (The proof relies on the implicit function theorem, using the domination
property of the spray F ; this is why the number r1 may be chosen to depend only on F .) In
the case at hand, the cited lemma furnishes a map

γ(p, ζ) = (p, ζ + c(p, ζ)),

p ∈ C ′ = A ∩ B′, ζ ∈ r1Bm

satisfying (3.13) on C ′× r1Bm. We extend c (and hence γ) to I(C ′) = A∩ I(B′) by setting

c(p, ζ) = c(I(p), ¯ζ),

p ∈ I(C ′), ζ ∈ r1Bm.

This implies that the resulting map c : C × r1Bm → Cm is (I, I0)-invariant. Since F and
G are (I, I0)-invariant, γ satisﬁes condition (3.13) also on I(C ′) × r1Bm.

Pick a number r2 with 0 < r2 < r1; for example, we may take r2 = r1/2. Assuming that
||F − G||0,C×rBm is small enough, the map γ is so close to the identity map on C × r1Bm
(see (3.12)) that Lemma 3.8 applies. Let α and β be maps of the form (3.8) satisfying
condition (3.9). It follows that

F ◦ α = G ◦ γ ◦ α = G ◦ β on C × r2Bn.

(3.14)
Hence, the sprays F ◦ α and G ◦ β amalgamate into a spray H : (A ∪ B) × r2Bm → Z
of class AI,I0(A ∪ B). Since α is close to the identity on A × r2Bm and the composition
operator α 7→ F ◦ α is continuous for α near the identity, the map H|A×r2Bm = F ◦ α is
close to F on A × r2Bm. Hence, Proposition 3.7 holds with r′ = r2. Note that, by the
construction, r′ depends only F .

(cid:3)

Remark 3.9 (On the estimates). Note that the sup-norms of the maps α and β in (3.14)
depend only on the norm of γ, and hence on ||F − G||0,C×rBm. This gives (not necessarily
linear) estimates of ||H − F||0,A×r2Bm and ||H − G||0,B×r2Bm in terms of ||F − G||0,C×rBm
and the sup norms of F and G on their respective domains. In applications, the ﬁrst spray F
is ﬁxed and hence we can estimate ||H − F||0,A×r2Bm solely in terms of ||F − G||0,C×rBm.
However, the second spray G is typically obtained by Runge approximation of F over
A ∩ B, and hence one cannot estimate ||H − G||0,B×r2 Bm solely by ||F − G||0,C×rBm.
An exception with better estimates will occur in the proof of Lemma 4.6, due to a special
situation which allows approximation of F by G on a bigger set.

We wish to point out that the splitting and gluing results presented above also work for
(cid:3)

sprays of class A k for any k ∈ Z+, with the same proofs.

3.3. I-invariant period dominating sprays. In this subsection, we construct (I, I0)-
invariant period dominating sprays with values in the punctured null quadric A∗ (see
Proposition 3.12).

The following notion will play an important role; cf. [13, Deﬁnition 2.2].

Deﬁnition 3.10. Let A be a compact connected smoothly bounded domain in an open
Riemann surface N . A holomorphic map f : A → A∗ is ﬂat if the image f (A) is contained
in a complex ray Cν (ν ∈ A∗) of the null cone A (2.18); otherwise f is nonﬂat.

By [13, Lemma 2.3], a holomorphic map f : A → A∗ is nonﬂat if and only if the tangent
spaces Tf (p)A∗ over all points p ∈ A span Cn. This condition and the following simple
lemma are used in the proof of Proposition 3.12.
Lemma 3.11. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26) and let A be a compact I-invariant
domain in N . Every I-invariant holomorphic map f : A → A∗ is nonﬂat.
Proof. Since f is I-invariant, we have f (I(p)) = f (p) for all p ∈ A. If f (A) ⊂ Cν for
some ν ∈ A∗, then the above condition implies ¯ν ∈ Cν, and hence ν = e2it ¯ν for some
t ∈ R. This means that the vector e−itν ∈ A∗ is real, a contradiction since the punctured
null quadric does not contain any real vectors.

(cid:3)

Clearly, a conformal minimal immersion X : A → Rn is ﬂat, in the sense that the image
X(A) is contained in an afﬁne 2-plane in Rn, if and only if the map f = 2∂X/θ : A → A∗
is ﬂat; here θ is any nowhere vanishing holomorphic 1-form on N . (See Subsec. 2.4.) Note
that an immersion from a non-orientable surface is never ﬂat. Hence, if X : A → Rn is an
I-invariant conformal minimal immersion then X and its derivative f = 2∂X/θ : A → A∗
are nonﬂat.

Proposition 3.12 (Existence of I-invariant period dominating sprays). Assume that
(N , I, θ) is a standard triple (2.25), A ⊂ N is a compact I-invariant domain with C 1
boundary in N , B ⊂ H1(A; Z) is a homology basis of the form (2.8) or (2.9), and
B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} ⊂ B is given by (2.10). Let P : A (A, Cn) → (Cn)l denote the period
map (2.23) associated to θ and B+. Given a I-invariant map f : A → A∗ of class A (A),
there exists a ball U ⊂ Cm around 0 ∈ Cm for some m ∈ N and a dominating (I, I0)-
invariant spray F : A× U → A∗ of class A (A) with core F (· , 0) = f which is also period
dominating, in the sense that the differential

∂ζ(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=0P(F (· , ζ)) : Cm −→ (Cn)l

(3.15)
maps Rm (the real part of Cm) surjectively onto Rn × (Cn)l−1.
Remark 3.13. This notion of period domination is stronger than the one in [10] which
merely asks that the differential (3.15) be surjective. The reason for introducing this stronger
condition is that we shall use maps F (· , ζ) : N → A∗ for real values of the parameter ζ
since these are I-invariant (see Lemma 3.2). The ﬁrst factor on the right hand side is Rn

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

35

(and not Cn) since the ﬁrst curve δ1 = α0 in the homology basis B+ satisﬁes I∗δ1 = δ1,
and henceRδ1 ℑφ = 0 for any I-invariant holomorphic 1-form φ (see (2.6)).

Proof of Proposition 3.12. We follow the proof of [10, Lemma 5.1] with certain modiﬁca-
tions. We shall ﬁnd a desired spray F of the form (3.5):

(cid:3)

(3.16)

F (p, ζ1, . . . , ζm) = φ1

ζ1h1(p) ◦ φ2

ζ2h2(p) ◦ ··· ◦ φm

ζmhm(p)(f (p)),

p ∈ A,

where φi is the ﬂow of some holomorphic vector ﬁeld Vi of type (3.6) on Cn and
ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζm) ∈ Cm. Any such spray is (I, I0)-invariant and has range in A∗.

We begin by constructing continuous complex-valued functions h1, . . . , hm (for a
suitably big m ∈ N) on the union of the curves δ1, . . . , δl so that the domination condition
in Proposition 3.12 holds. (This condition clearly makes sense for sprays F deﬁned over the
union of these curves.) Each of the functions hi is supported on only one of the curves δj,
their supports are pairwise disjoint, and they do not contain any of the intersection points
of these curves. Such functions can be found by following the proof of [10, Lemma 5.1],
except for the ﬁrst curve δ1 where we need to modify the construction as explained below.
In the construction of the hi’s it is crucial that f is nonﬂat (cf. Lemma 3.11) which ensures
that the tangent spaces Tf (p)A∗ over all point p ∈ A span Cn; see [13, Lemma 2.3].

In order to get a (I, I0)-invariant spray, the functions hi in (3.16) must be I-invariant.
Recall that I(δ1) = δ1 while I(δj ) ∩ δj = ∅ for j = 2, . . . , l. Each of the functions hi
is extended to the curves I(δj ) for j = 2, . . . , l by setting hi(I(p)) = hi(p) for p ∈ δj.
The ﬁrst curve δ1 = α0 is of the form δ1 = σ ∪ I(σ), where σ is an embedded Jordan
arc intersecting I(σ) only in both endpoints q, I(q). We construct the functions hi ﬁrst on
σ, satisfying hi(I(q)) = hi(q), and extend them to I(σ) by setting hi(I(p)) = hi(p) for
p ∈ σ, so they are I-invariant. (This only concerns the functions hi supported on δ1.)

Recall that the support |B| of the union of the curves in B is Runge in A; hence we can
approximate each hi by a holomorphic function gi ∈ O(A). The holomorphic function
2(cid:0)gi + gi ◦ I(cid:1) on A is then I-invariant and it approximates hi uniformly on |B|.
˜hi = 1
Replacing hi by ˜hi in (3.16) furnishes a (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic spray on A with
values in A∗. If the approximations of hi by ˜hi were sufﬁciently close, then this spray still
satisﬁes the period domination property in Proposition 3.12.

Finally, to get the domination property of F we insert additional ﬂow terms into the
(cid:3)

deﬁnition of F (3.16). For further details, see [10, Lemma 5.1].

3.4. Banach manifold structure of the space CMIn
I (N ). A compact bordered Riemann
surface is a compact Riemann surface, N , with nonempty boundary bN 6= ∅ consisting
of ﬁnitely many Jordan curves. The interior ˚N = N \ bN of such an N is said to be
a bordered Riemann surface. By standard results (see e.g. Stout [85]), N embeds as a
compact domain with smooth real analytic boundary in an open (or closed) Riemann surface
eN . In particular, we can compactify N by gluing a complex disk along each boundary

I (N )

curve of N so that their complex structures match on the boundary. Furthermore, a ﬁxed-
point-free antiholomorphic involution I : N → N extends by the reﬂection principle to an
involution of the same kind on a neighborhoood of N in eN .
Given (N , I) as above and an integer n ≥ 3, we shall denote by
the set of I-invariant conformal immersions N → Rn of class C 1(N ) which are harmonic
on the interior ˚N .
(Compare with (2.24).) With a minor abuse of language, maps
X ∈ CMIn
I (N ) will be called I-invariant conformal minimal immersions on N . Given
an integer r ∈ N, we set

I (N ) = CMIn
I (N ) ∩ C r(N , Rn).
By [13, Theorem 3.1 (a)], every X ∈ CMIn,r
I (N ) can be approximated in the C r(N )
topology by conformal minimal immersions in a neighborhood of N in any open Riemann
surface eN containing N as a smoothly bounded domain. By Corollary 3.20,
the
approximating immersions may be chosen I-invariant.
Theorem 3.14. Let (N , I) be a compact bordered Riemann surface with a ﬁxed-point-free
antiholomorphic involution. Then, CMIn,r
I (N ) is a real analytic Banach manifold for any
n ≥ 3 and r ∈ N.

In this subsection, we prove the following result.

CMIn,r

An equivalent formulation of Theorem 3.14 is the following.

Corollary 3.15. Let N be a compact non-orientable bordered surface endowed with a
conformal structure. The set of all conformal minimal immersions N → Rn of class
C r(N , Rn) is a real analytic Banach manifold for any n ≥ 3 and r ∈ N.

The corresponding result in the orientable case is [13, Theorem 3.2 (b)]; however, ﬂat
immersions were excluded for technical reasons. This is not necessary here since every
immersion of a non-orientable surface to Rn is nonﬂat.

Let θ ∈ ΩI(N ) be a nowhere vanishing I-invariant 1-form on N , and let P denote the
period map (2.23) associated to θ and a homology basis B+ (see (2.10)). By the discussion
in Subsec. 2.4, we have the following equivalence:

(N , A∗) and ℜP(f ) = 0.

X ∈ CMIn,r

We obtain X from f by integration, X(p) =R p ℜ(f θ) (p ∈ N ). Assuming as we may that
N is connected, this gives for every r ∈ N an isomorphism
where the ﬁrst summand accounts for the choice of the initial value at some point p0 ∈ N
and the second summand equals

This shows that Theorem 3.14 is an immediate consequence of the following result.
Proposition 3.16. Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25), where N is a compact bordered
Riemann surface with smooth boundary. Let n ≥ 3 and r ∈ Z+ be integers, and let A
denote the quadric (2.15) in Cn. Then, the following hold:

(1) The space A r(N , A∗) is a locally closed split complex Banach submanifold of the

complex Banach space A r(N , Cn).
the real Banach space A r
I (N , Cn).

(3) The space A r−1

of ﬁnite codimension in the Banach manifold A r

I (N , A∗).

The notion of a split Banach submanifold will be explained in the proof. Although part
(1) is known (see [38]), it is included because we give here a different proof which also
applies to obtain parts (2) and (3).

Proof. Consider the map Ψ : A r(N , Cn) → A r(N , C) = A r(N ) given by

Ψ(f ) = Ψ(f1, f2, . . . , fn) =

(fj)2.

nXj=1

I (N , Cn) of A r(N , Cn) into the real subspace A r

Clearly, Ψ is a holomorphic map of complex Banach spaces which takes the closed
real subspace A r
I (N , C) of the space
A r(N , C). Note that
I (N , A∗) = {f ∈ A r
A r
I,0(N , A∗) = {f ∈ A r
A r

I (N , Cn \ {0}) : Ψ(f ) = 0},
I,0(N , Cn \ {0}) : Ψ(f ) = 0}.

Fix f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) ∈ A r(N , Cn). The differential

Θ := DΨf : A r(N , Cn) → A r(N )
is given on any tangent vector g = (g1, . . . , gn) ∈ A r(N , Cn) by

Ψ(f + tg) = 2

Θ(g) =

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

Note that Θ(hg) = hΘ(g) for any h ∈ A r(N ).

Assume now that f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) ∈ A r(N , A∗). Then, the component functions
fj ∈ A r(N ) have no common zeros on N . We shall need the following result. (We thank
E. L. Stout for pointing out the relevant references in a private communication.)
Lemma 3.17. Let N be a compact bordered Riemann surface with smooth boundary, and
let r ∈ Z+. Given functions f1, . . . , fn ∈ A r(N ) without common zeros, there exist

38

functions g1, . . . , gn ∈ A r(N ) such that

If N admits a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomorphic involution I and f1, . . . , fn ∈ A r
no common zeros, then there exist g1, . . . , gn ∈ A r

I (N ) satisfying (3.19).

I (N ) have

Proof. When N = D is the closed unit disk in the plane and r = 0, this is an immediate
consequence of the classical result that the maximal ideal space of the disk algebra A (D)
equals D (see e.g. Hoffman [63, Corollary, p. 88]). Precisely, every maximal ideal in A (D)
equals Ip = {f ∈ A (D) : f (p) = 0} for some point p ∈ D. (For the theory of closed ideals
in A (D), see Rudin [82].) The collection of all elements on the left hand side of (3.19) over
all possible choices of g1, . . . , gn ∈ A (D) is an ideal of A (D). Since the functions fj have
no common zeros, this ideal is not contained in any of the maximal ideals Ip for p ∈ D, and
hence it equals A(D).

The case of a general bordered Riemann surface N follows from the disk case as shown
by Arens [21]; here is a brief outline (still for the case r = 0). Choose an Ahlfors map
h : N → D (see Ahlfors [2]). The map h is a proper branched covering, unbranched
over the boundary bD. With only ﬁnitely many exceptions, each ﬁber h−1(z) for z ∈ D
has precisely d points for some ﬁxed integer d ∈ N. The algebra A (N ) is integral over
h∗A(D), meaning that each g ∈ A(N ) satisﬁes monic polynomial equation of degree d with
coefﬁcients from h∗A(D). The homomorphism λ : A(D) → A(N ) given by λ(g) = g ◦ h
induces a dual map λ∗ from the maximal ideal space of A (N ) onto the maximal ideal space
of A(D) which equals D. The integrality condition implies that ﬁbers of λ contain at most
d points. The map λ is an extension of the Ahlfors map h, so for z ∈ D, the ﬁbers λ−1(z)
and h−1(z) have the same number of points. They therefore coincide, which shows that the
maximal ideal space of A(N ) is N . The existence of a solution to the equation (3.19) then
follows as in the case of the disk.

Assume now that r > 0. By Mergelyan’s theorem [76], A r(N ) ⊂ A (N ) is
dense in A (N ). Given functions f1, . . . , fn ∈ A r(N ) without common zeros, choose
g1, . . . , gn ∈ A (N ) such that (3.19) holds. Approximating each gj sufﬁciently closely by
a function ˜gj ∈ A r(N ), the function φ =Pn
j=1 fj ˜gj ∈ A r(N ) has no zeros on N , and
hence the functions Gj = ˜gj/φ ∈ A r(N ) satisfyPn
Assume now that f1, . . . , fn ∈ A r
(3.19) holds. Since fj = ¯fj ◦ I, the functions Gj = 1
Pn
j=1 fjGj = 1 and we are done.
We continue with the proof of Proposition 3.16. Lemma 3.17 shows that for every
f = (f1, . . . , fn) ∈ A r(N , A∗) there exists ψ = (ψ1, . . . , ψn) ∈ A r(N , Cn) such that

I (N ). Let g1, . . . , gn ∈ A r(N ) be chosen such that
I (N ) also satisfy

2 (gj + ¯gj ◦ I) ∈ A r

j=1 fjGj = 1.

Θ(ψ) = 1 on N . It follows that
(3.20)

The set

Θ(hψ) = h for every h ∈ A r(N ).

E := {ψg : g ∈ A r(N )} ⊂ A r(N , Cn)

is a closed subspace of A r(N , Cn) and we have a direct sum decomposition
(3.21)
g = (g − Θ(g)ψ) + Θ(g)ψ.

A r(N , Cn) = (ker Θ) ⊕ E,

Equation (3.20) shows that the differential Θ = DΨf maps E isomorphically onto
A r(N ). Hence, the implicit function theorem for maps of Banach spaces provides an open
neighborhood U of f in A r(N , Cn \ {0}) such that U ∩ A r(N , A∗) is a closed complex
Banach submanifold of U whose tangent space at f equals ker Θ. (We can locally represent
this submanifold as a graph over ker Θ.) This proves part (1) of Proposition 3.16.

The notion of a split submanifold refers to the fact that at every point of the submanifold,
its tangent space admits a closed direct sum complement in the ambient Banach space. This
always holds for submanifolds of ﬁnite codimension, but in our case the normal direction
corresponds to the inﬁnite dimensional space E ∼= A r(N ).

The rest of the argument is exactly as in part (1).

It remains to prove part (3). Recall from (3.17) that

I (N , A∗) : ℜP(f ) = 0}.
I (N , Cn), and hence
Note that the equation ℜP(f ) = 0 is linear on the Banach space A r
real analytic on A r
I,0(N , A∗). By Proposition 3.12, f is the core
f = F (· , 0) of a period dominating (I, I0)-invariant spray F : N × B → A∗ for some ball
0 ∈ B ⊂ CN . Hence, the equation ℜP(f ) = 0, deﬁning A r
I,0(N , A∗) as a subset of the
real analytic Banach manifold A r
I (N , A∗), has maximal rank at f . Since this amounts to
ﬁnitely many scalar equations and every closed subspace of ﬁnite codimension in a Banach
space is complemented, the implicit function theorem completes the proof. See [13, proof
of Theorem 3.2] for more details.

3.5. Basic approximation results. The main result of this subsection is a basic Runge
approximation theorem for I-invariant conformal minimal immersions; see Proposition
3.19. This is the non-critical case in the proof of the Mergelyan theorems 4.4 and 4.5.
Its proof is based on the following lemma concerning the approximation of I-invariant
holomorphic maps into the punctured null quadric A∗ (2.18) with control of the periods.

Lemma 3.18 (Approximate extension to a bump). Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25),
and let (A, B) be a very special I-invariant Cartan pair in N (see Deﬁnition 3.6). Let
P denote the period map (2.23) for the domain A. Then, every map f ∈ AI(A, A∗)
can be approximated uniformly on A by maps ˜f ∈ AI(A ∪ B, A∗) satisfying P( ˜f ) =
P(f ). Furthermore, ˜f can be chosen such that there exists a homotopy ft ∈ AI(A, A∗)
(t ∈ [0, 1]), with f0 = f and f1 = ˜f|A, such that ft is uniformly close to f on A and
P(ft) = P(f ) for each t ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. Let B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} be the period basis (2.10) for the domain A. Since A contains
all nontrivial topology of A∪ B, B+ is then also a period basis for A∪ B. Let P denote the
associated period map (2.23).

f θ ∈ Rn since f θ is I-invariant.

By Proposition 3.12, there exist a ball rBm ⊂ Cm for some m ∈ N and r > 0 and a
dominating and period dominating spray F : A × rBm → A∗ of class AI,I0(A) with the
core F (· , 0) = f . Note that P1(f ) =Rδ1
By the deﬁnition of a very special Cartan pair (see Deﬁnition 3.6), we have B =
B′ ∪ I(B′) where the sets B′ and C ′ = A ∩ B′ are disks and B′ ∩ I(B′) = ∅. Pick a
number r′ ∈ (0, r). Since A∗ is an Oka manifold, we can approximate F as closely as
desired uniformly on C ′ × r′Bm by a holomorphic spray G : B′ × r′Bm → A∗ (cf. [39,
Theorem 5.4.4, p. 193]). We extend G to I(B′) × r′Bm by setting
(3.22)
Hence, G is a (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic spray on B × r′Bm with values in A∗.

G(p, ζ) = G(cid:0)I(p), ¯ζ(cid:1)

for p ∈ I(B′) and ζ ∈ r′Bm.

By Proposition 3.7 (see also Remark 3.9) there is a number r′′ ∈ (0, r′) with the
following property: For any spray G as above such that ||F − G||0,C×rBm is small enough
there is a spray H : (A ∪ B) × r′′Bm → A∗ of class AI,I0(A ∪ B) (obtained by gluing
If
F and G), and we can estimate ||H − F||0,A×r′′ Bm in terms of ||F − G||0,C×r′ Bm.
||H − F||0,A×r′′Bm is small enough, the period domination property of F gives a point
ζ0 ∈ r′′Bm ∩ Rm close to 0 such that the I-invariant map
˜f = H(· , ζ0) : A ∪ B → A∗
(3.23)
of class A (A ∪ B) approximates f uniformly on A and satisﬁes P(f ) = P( ˜f ).

It remains to explain the existence of a homotopy ft in the lemma. Consider the space
AI(A, rBm) of all I-invariant maps α : A → rBm; this is an open neighborhood of the
origin in the real Banach space AI(A, Cm). Let F : A × rBm → A∗ be a (I, I0)-invariant
spray as above. For every α ∈ AI(A, rBm) the map

is I-invariant according to Lemma 2.2, and hence

Fα : A → A∗, Fα(p) = F (p, α(p)) (p ∈ A)

P(Fα) ∈ Rn × (Cn)l−1

for all α ∈ AI(A, rBm).

(The ﬁrst factor on the right hand side is Rn and not Cn; cf. Remark 3.13.) Since
AI(A, rBm) contains all constant real maps A → ζ ∈ Rm ∩ rBm, the period domination

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

41

property of F (see (3.15)) implies that the map

AI(A, rBm) ∋ α 7−→ P(Fα) ∈ Rn × (Cn)l−1

is submersive at α = 0. It follows from the implicit function theorem for Banach spaces
that, locally near α = 0, the set
(3.24)
is a real analytic Banach submanifold of the Banach space AI(A, Cm). More precisely, we
can represent it locally as a graph over the kernel of the differential of the period map at
α = 0; the latter is a closed linear subspace of AI(A, Cm) of ﬁnite codimension, and hence
it admits a closed complementary subspace.

AI,f (A, rBm) = {α ∈ AI(A, rBm) : P(Fα) = P(F0) = P(f )}

By the proof of Proposition 3.7 (see in particular (3.14)), the spray H obtained by gluing

F and G is of the following form over the domain A:

H(p, ζ) = F (p, ζ + a(p, ζ)),

p ∈ A, ζ ∈ r′′Bm,

where a ∈ AI,I0(A × r′′Bm, Cm) is close to the zero map. Let ζ0 ∈ r′′Bm ∩ Rm be the
point determining the map ˜f (see (3.23)), and set

α(p) = ζ0 + a(p, ζ0),

p ∈ A.

Since P( ˜f ) = P(f ) by the choice of ζ0, the map α belongs to the space AI,f (A, rBm)
(3.24). Assuming as we may that α0 is sufﬁciently close to the origin where this space is
a local Banach manifold, we may connect it to the origin by a path αt ∈ AI,f (A, rBm)
(t ∈ [0, 1]) such that α0 = 0 and α1 = α. Set
ft(p) = F (p, αt(p)),

p ∈ A, t ∈ [0, 1].

By the construction, the homotopy ft : A → A∗ consists of maps of class AI(A) which are
close to f = f0 and satisfy P(ft) = P(f ) for all t ∈ [0, 1].

(cid:3)

Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26), and let ι : N → N = N /I denote the quotient
projection. By pulling back a strongly subharmonic exhaustion function ρ : N → R, we get
a strongly subharmonic exhaustion function ρ = ρ ◦ ι : N → R which is I-invariant in the
sense that ρ ◦ I = ρ.
Proposition 3.19. Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25). Assume that ρ : N → R is
a smooth I-invariant exhaustion function which has no critical values in [a, b] for some
a < b. Set A = {ρ ≤ a} and eA = {ρ ≤ b}. Let n ≥ 3 and let A∗ ⊂ Cn be the null
quadric (1.7). Then, every map f ∈ AI(A, A∗) can be approximated uniformly on A by
maps ˜f ∈ AI(eA, A∗) such that ( ˜f − f )θ is exact on A. Furthermore, ˜f can be chosen such
that there is a homotopy ft ∈ AI(A, A∗) (t ∈ [0, 1]) satisfying f0 = f , f1 = ˜f|A, and for
every t ∈ [0, 1] the difference (ft − f )θ is uniformly small and exact on A.
Proof. By elementary arguments we can ﬁnd an increasing sequence of I-invariant compact
sets A = A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Ak = eA such that for every i = 0, . . . , k − 1 we have
Ai+1 = Ai ∪ Bi, where (Ai, Bi) is a very special Cartan pair (see Deﬁnition 3.6). We can

42

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

get such a sequence for example by using [39, Lemma 5.10.3, p. 218] with the function ρ in
the quotient surface N = N /I. It remains to apply Lemma 3.18 to each pair (Ai, Bi). (cid:3)
Corollary 3.20 (Mergelyan approximation theorem in the noncritical case). Let (N , I) and
A ⊂ eA ⊂ N be as in Proposition 3.19. Every I-invariant conformal minimal immersion
X : A → Rn of class C 1(A) can be approximated in the C 1(A) topology by I-invariant
conformal minimal immersions eX : eA → Rn satisfying Flux eX = FluxX . Furthermore,
eX can be chosen such that there exists a homotopy of I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion Xt : A → Rn (t ∈ [0, 1]), with X0 = X and X1 = eX, such that for every
t ∈ [0, 1] the map Xt is close to X in C 1(A, Rn) and satisﬁes FluxXt = FluxX.
Proof. Let θ ∈ ΩI(N ) be a nowhere vanishing I-invariant 1-form, B+ ⊂ B be a period
basis for H1(A; Z) (cf. (2.10)), and P : A (N , Cn) → (Cn)l be the period map (2.23)
associated to B+ and θ. The map f = 2∂X/θ : A → A∗ is of class AI(A). Proposition
3.19 furnishes a map ˜f : eA → A∗ of class AI(eA) which approximates f as closely as
desired uniformly on A and satisﬁes P( ˜f ) = P(f ); in particular, ℜP( ˜f ) = 0. Note
that A is a strong deformation retract of eA and hence these two domains have the same
topology. By Lemma 2.5, the 1-form ℜ( ˜f θ) integrates to a I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion eX : eA → Rn with the same ﬂux as X. Similarly, for each map in the homotopy
ft : A → A∗ (t ∈ [0, 1]) furnished by Proposition 3.19 the 1-form ℜ( ˜ftθ) integrates to a
I-invariant conformal minimal immersion Xt : A → Rn with the same ﬂux as X. Since
f0 = f and f1 = ˜f, a suitable choice of constants of integration ensures that X0 = X and
X1 = eX|A.
(cid:3)
Corollary 3.21 (A local Mergelyan theorem for conformal minimal immersions). Let
(N , I) be a standard pair (2.26) and K be a compact I-invariant domain with C 1 boundary
in N . Every I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X ∈ CMIn
I (K) (n ≥ 3) can be
approximated in the C 1(K)-topology by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions in an
open neighborhood of K in N .
3.6. The Riemann-Hilbert method for non-orientable minimal surfaces. In this
subsection, we prove the following version of the Riemann-Hilbert method for I-invariant
conformal minimal immersions of bordered Riemann surfaces. Its main application will be
to conformal minimal immersions of non-orientable bordered surfaces. For background and
motivation, see Subsec. 1.3.
Theorem 3.22. Let (N , I) be a compact bordered Riemann surface with an antiholomor-
phic involution without ﬁxed points. Let I1, I(I1), . . . , Ik, I(Ik) be a ﬁnite collection of
pairwise disjoint compact subarcs of bN which are not connected components of bN . Set
I ′ :=Sk
i=1 Ii and I := I ′ ∪ I(I ′). Choose a thin annular neighborhood R ⊂ N of bN (a
collar) and a smooth retraction ρ : R → bN . Let n ≥ 3 be an integer. Assume that
(a) X : N → Rn is a conformal minimal immersion of class C 1(N );

(b) r : bN → R+ is a continuous nonnegative I-invariant function supported on I;
(c) α : I × D → Rn is a map of class C 1 such that for every p ∈ I the map
D ∋ ζ 7→ α(p, ζ) ∈ Rn is a conformal minimal immersion satisfying α(p, 0) = 0
and α(I(p), ζ) = α(p, ζ);

(d) if n > 3, we assume in addition that α is planar of the form

p ∈ Ii ∪ I(Ii), i ∈ {1, . . . , k},

α(p, ζ) = ℜσ(p, ζ)ui + ℑσ(p, ζ)vi,
where for each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, ui, vi ∈ Rn is a pair of orthogonal vectors
satisfying kuik = kvik > 0, and σ : I × D → C is a function of class C 1
such that for every p ∈ I the function D ∋ ζ 7→ σ(p, ζ) is holomorphic on D,
σ(p, 0) = 0, the partial derivative ∂σ(p, ζ)/∂ζ is nowhere vanishing on D, and
σ(I(p), ζ) = σ(p, ζ) for all (p, ζ) ∈ I × D.

κ(p, ζ) = X(p) + α(p, r(p)ζ),

Consider the map κ : bN × D → Rn given by
(3.25)
where we take κ(p, ζ) = X(p) for p ∈ bN \ I. Given a number ǫ > 0, there exist
an arbitrarily small neighborhood Ω ⊂ R of I and an I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion Y ∈ CMIn
i) dist(Y (p), κ(p, T)) < ǫ for all p ∈ bN ;
ii) dist(Y (p), κ(ρ(p), D)) < ǫ for all p ∈ Ω;
iii) Y is ǫ-close to X in the C 1 norm on N \ Ω;
iv) FluxY = FluxX.

I (N ) (see (2.24)) satisfying the following conditions:

Observe that the conditions on the vectors ui, vi ∈ Rn in part (d) imply that
wi = ui − ivi ∈ A∗ ⊂ Cn is a null vector for every i = 1, . . . , k. Hence, the map
α(p,· ) : D → Rn in (d) is a planar conformal minimal immersion for every p ∈ I.
Proof. This is an adaptation of [5, Theorem 3.2] (for n = 3) and of [6, Theorem
3.6] (for any n ≥ 3) to the case of I-invariant maps. The latter result is essentially
a consequence of [6, Theorem 3.5] which gives the Riemann-Hilbert method for null
holomorphic immersions N → Cn. This method was ﬁrst developed for null curves in
dimension n = 3 by Alarc´on and Forstneriˇc in [11, Theorem 4].

It sufﬁces to explain the proof for k = 1, i.e., when I = I ′ ∪ I(I ′) is the union of a pair
of disjoint I-symmetric arcs; the general case follows by applying this special case to each
pair (Ii, I(Ii)) for i = 1, . . . , k.

Pick an I-invariant holomorphic 1-form θ without zeros on N (cf. Proposition 2.3). Let
B ⊂ H1(N ; Z) be a homology basis of the form (2.8) or (2.9) (depending on the parity of
the genus of N ), with support |B| ⊂ ˚N , and let B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} ⊂ B be given by (2.10).
Let P : A (N , Cn) → (Cn)l denote the period map (2.23) associated to B+ and θ. Then,
2∂X = f θ where f : N → A∗ is a nonﬂat map of class AI(N , A∗) satisfying ℜP(f ) = 0.

We can write N = A ∪ B where (A, B) is a very special Cartan pair (see Deﬁnition
3.6) such that |B+| ⊂ A and the set B = B′ ∪ I(B′) ⊂ R is the disjoint union of a pair
of small closed disks B′ (a neighborhood of I ′) and I(B′) (a neighborhood of I(I ′)). Set
C ′ = A ∩ B′ and C = A ∩ B = C ′ ∪ I(C ′).

By Proposition 3.12, there exist a ball U ⊂ Cm around 0 ∈ Cm for some m ∈ N and
a dominating and period dominating (I, I0)-invariant spray F : N × U → A∗ of class
A (N ) (cf. (3.15)). Pick a point p0 ∈ C ′ = A ∩ B′. After shrinking U slightly around 0 if
necessary, we can apply [6, Lemma 3.1] (when n = 3) or [6, Lemma 3.3] (when n ≥ 3 and
α satisﬁes Condition (d) in the theorem) to approximate the spray F as closely as desired
uniformly on C ′ × U by a spray G : B′ × U → A∗ such that for every ﬁxed value of ζ ∈ U,
the integral

X′(p, ζ) = X(p0) + ℜZ p

p0

G(· , ζ)θ,

p ∈ B′,

is a conformal minimal immersion B′ → Rn, and X′(· , 0) satisﬁes Conditions (i)–(iii) in
Theorem 3.22 with N replaced by B′. (The integral is independent of the choice of path in
the simply connected domain B′.) A spray G with these properties is obtained by deforming
F near each point p ∈ I in the direction of the null holomorphic disk in Cn whose real part
equals r(p)α(p,· ) : D → Cn.

We extend G to I(B′) × U by simmetrization (cf. (3.22)) so that the resulting spray
G : B × U → A∗ is (I, I0)-invariant. Since the spray F is (I, I0)-invariant, it follows
that G approximates F also on I(C ′) × U. Assuming that the approximation of F by G
is close enough on C × U, we can apply Proposition 3.7 to glue the sprays F|A×U and G
into a (I, I0)-invariant spray H : N × U ′ → A∗ of class A(N × U ′), where U ′ ⊂ Cm is a
smaller neighborhood of the origin, such that H|A×U ′ is uniformly close to F|A×U ′. If the
approximation of F by H is close enough, the period domination property of F implies that
there exists a parameter value ζ0 ∈ U ′ close to 0 such that the map h = H(· , ζ0) : N → A∗
satisﬁes P(h) = P(f ); in particular, ℜP(h) = 0. Fix a point p0 ∈ N . The map
Y : N → Cn given by

Y (p) = X(p0) + ℜZ p

p0

hθ,

p ∈ N ,

is then a well deﬁned I-invariant conformal minimal immersion satisfying the conclusion of
Theorem 3.22 provided that all approximations were sufﬁciently close. In particular, from
ℑP(h) = ℑP(f ) it follows that FluxY = FluxX, so Condition (iv) holds. For further
details, we refer to [6, proof of Theorems 3.5 and 3.6] or [11, proof of Theorem 4].

4. APPROXIMATION THEOREMS FOR NON-ORIENTABLE MINIMAL SURFACES

The aim of this section is to provide general Runge-Mergelyan type theorems for non-
orientable conformal minimal immersions into Rn for any n ≥ 3. The main results are
Theorems 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, and 4.12; these include Theorem 1.2 stated in the Introduction as a

special case. For the corresponding approximation results in the orientable case, see [13]
and the references therein.

We begin by introducing suitable subsets and maps for Mergelyan approximation;

compare with [13, Deﬁnition 5.1] in the orientable case.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A nonempty compact subset S of N is I-admissible if it is Runge in N ,
I-invariant (I(S) = S), and of the form S = K ∪ Γ, where K = ˚S is the union of ﬁnitely
many pairwise disjoint smoothly bounded compact domains in N and Γ = S \ K is a ﬁnite
union of pairwise disjoint smooth Jordan arcs meeting K only in their endpoints (or not at
all) and such that their intersections with the boundary bK of K are transverse.

If S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N is a I-admissible set, then the sets K and Γ are clearly I-invariant.
Since Γ does not contain any closed curves, we have either Γ = ∅ or Γ = Γ′ ∪ I(Γ′),
where Γ′ is union of connected components of Γ and Γ′ ∩ I(Γ′) = ∅. In particular, if S is
connected then K 6= ∅.

Given a complex submanifold Z of Cn which is invariant under conjugation I0(z) = ¯z

(note that the null quadric A∗ (2.15) is such), we denote by
(4.1)
the set of all smooth I-invariant functions f : S → Z, i.e. f ◦ I = f , that are holomorphic
on an open neighborhood of K depending on the map. We write

FI(S, Z)

FI(S) = FI(S, C).

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26), let S = K∪Γ ⊂ N be an I-admissible
set, and let n ≥ 3. A generalized I-invariant conformal minimal immersion S → Rn is a
pair (X, f θ), where θ ∈ ΩI(N ) has no zeros (hence (N , I, θ) is a standard triple (2.25)),
f ∈ FI(S, A∗) (cf. (4.1)) and X : S → Rn is a smooth I-invariant map (i.e., X ◦ I = X)
such that the following condition holds:
(4.2) X(p) = X(q) +Z p

for all p, q in the same connected component of S.

q ℜ(f θ)

The group homomorphism

(4.3)

Flux(X,f θ) : H1(S; Z) → Rn, Flux(X,f θ)(γ) =Zγ ℑ(f θ)

is called the ﬂux map of (X, f θ).

Except for I-invariance, Deﬁnition 4.2 coincides with [13, Deﬁnition 5.2]. We denote by

(4.4)
the set of all generalized I-invariant conformal minimal immersions S → Rn.

I (S)

GCMIn

We shall use the following notion of C 1 approximation of generalized conformal minimal

immersions.

46

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

Deﬁnition 4.3. Let S ⊂ N be a I-admissible set, and let (X, f θ) ∈ GCMIn
I (S) for some
n ≥ 3 (see (4.4)). We say that (X, f θ) may be approximated in the C 1(S)-topology by
I-invariant conformal minimal immersions on N if X may be approximated in the C 1(S)-
topology by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Y : N → Rn such that 2∂Y /θ
approximates f uniformly on S.

4.1. A Mergelyan approximation theorem. The following is the ﬁrst main result of this
subsection; this is a more precise version of Theorem 1.2 stated in the Introduction.

Theorem 4.4 (Mergelyan theorem for conformal non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn).
Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple, and let S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N be a I-admissible set
(cf. Deﬁnition 4.2). Assume that (X, f θ) ∈ GCMIn
I (S) for some n ≥ 3 (see (4.4)),
and let p : H1(N ; Z) → Rn be a group homomorphism such that p ◦ I∗ = −p and
p|H1(S;Z) = Flux(X,f θ) (cf. (4.3)). Then, (X, f θ) may be approximated in the C 1(S)-
topology by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Y : N → Rn with FluxY = p.

By passing to the quotient N = N /I, Theorem 4.4 gives the corresponding Mergelyan
approximation theorem for conformal minimal immersions from non-orientable surfaces;
see Corollary 1.3. The case n = 3 is proved in [20] by using the L´opez-Ros transformation
for minimal surfaces in R3, a tool which is not available in higher dimensions.

Theorem 4.4 follows easily from the following result which pertains to derivatives of

generalized I-invariant conformal minimal immersions.
Theorem 4.5. Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25), let S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N be a I-
admissible set (cf. Deﬁnition 4.2), let f : S → A∗ ⊂ Cn (n ≥ 3) be a map in FI(S, A∗)
(see (4.1)), and let q : H1(N ; Z) → Cn be a group homomorphism such that
f θ for every γ ∈ H1(S; Z).

q ◦ I∗ = q and

q(γ) =Zγ

Then, f may be approximated uniformly on S by maps h ∈ OI(N , A∗) such thatRγ hθ =
q(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(N ; Z) (hence, the 1-form (f − h)θ is exact on S), and there exists
a homotopy ft ∈ FI(S, A∗) (t ∈ [0, 1]) from f0 = f to f1 = h|S such that for every
t ∈ [0, 1], ft is holomorphic near K, uniformly close to f0 = f on S (also uniformly in
t ∈ [0, 1]), and it satisﬁes the condition
q(γ) =Zγ
(4.5)
ftθ

for every γ ∈ H1(S; Z).

Proof of Theorem 4.4 assuming Theorem 4.5. We may assume that N is connected. Let us
begin by considering the case when S is also connected. Let q : H1(N ; Z) → i Rn ⊂ Cn be
the group homomorphism given by q(γ) = i p(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(N ; Z). Clearly, q◦ I∗ = q
and q(γ) =Rγ f θ for every closed curve γ ⊂ S. By Theorem 4.5 we may approximate f
uniformly on S by maps h ∈ OI(S, A∗) satisfyingRγ hθ = i p(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(N ; Z);
in particular ℜ(hθ) is exact. Fix a point p0 ∈ S. The I-invariant conformal minimal

The case when S is not connected can be reduced to the former case as follows. Choose

adding ﬁnitely many smooth Jordan arcs to S (see [20, Claim 5.7]). Consider any extension

[20, Theorem 5.6] where the details are given for n = 3, or by symmetrizing the argument

immersions Y : N → Rn given by Y (p) = X(p0) +R p
p0 ℜ(hθ) satisﬁes the conclusion
of the theorem. Indeed, the integral is independent of the choice of a path, and for points
p ∈ S we may choose the path to lie entirely within the connected set S.
a connected I-admissible subset eS = K ∪eΓ such that Γ ⊂ eΓ; i.e., eS is obtained by
ef ∈ FI(eS, A∗) of f ∈ FI(S, A∗) such that X(p) = X(q) +R p
q ℜ(ef θ) for all p, q ∈ S
andRγ ef θ = ip(γ) for every closed curve γ ⊂ eS. To ﬁnd a smooth map ef satisfying these
properties, it sufﬁces to deﬁne it in a suitable way on the arcseΓ \ Γ; this can be done as in
in [13, Lemma 5.5]. Fix a point p0 ∈ S and set eX(p) = X(p0) +R p
p0 ℜ(ef θ) for all p ∈ eS.
I (eS), (eX,ef θ)|S = (X, f θ), and Flux( eX, ef θ) = p|H1(eS;Z).
It follows that (eX,ef θ) ∈ GCMIn
It remains to apply the previous case to (eX,ef θ) on the connected I-admissible set eS. (cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 4.5. Since the set S is Runge in N , there exists a smooth I-invariant
strongly subharmonic Morse exhaustion function ρ : N → R such that 0 is a regular value
of ρ, S ⊂ {ρ < 0}, and S is a strong deformation retract of the set M1 := {ρ ≤ 0}.
(For the existence of such a function ρ see the short discussion preceding Proposition 3.19.)
Thus, the inclusion map S ֒→ M1 induces an isomorphism H1(S; Z) ∼= H1(M1; Z). Let
p1, I(p1), p2, I(p2), . . . be the critical points of ρ in N \ M1; recall that ρ ◦ I = ρ. We
may assume that 0 < ρ(p1) < ρ(p2) < ··· . Choose an increasing divergent sequence
c1 < c2 < c3 < ··· such that ρ(pi) < ci < ρ(pi+1) holds for i = 1, 2, . . .. If there are
only ﬁnitely many pi’s, then we choose the remainder of the sequence ci arbitrarily subject
to the condition limi→∞ ci = +∞. Set Mi := {ρ ≤ ci}. It follows that

S ⋐ M1 ⋐ M2 ⋐ ··· ⋐

Mi = N

∞[i=1

and each Mi is a (not necessarily connected) compact I-invariant Runge domain in N
whose connected components are compact bordered Riemann surfaces.

We shall inductively construct a sequence of maps fj ∈ OI(Mj, A∗) which converges
uniformly on compacts to a map h ∈ OI(N , A∗) approximating f on S and satisfying
Rγ hθ = q(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(N ; Z).

The basis of the induction is given by the following lemma which will be applied to
the domain M = M1, and the resulting map ˜f will be taken as the ﬁrst element f1 in the
sequence. The inductive step is provided by Lemma 4.7.
Lemma 4.6. Assume that S is an I-admissible set in N (see Deﬁnition 4.1) and M ⊂ N
is a compact smoothly bounded I-invariant domain with S ⊂ ˚M such that S is strong
deformation retract of M. Then, any map f ∈ FI(S, A∗) can be approximated uniformly
on S by maps ˜f ∈ OI(M, A∗) such that the 1-form (f − ˜f )θ is exact on S, and there is a

48

homotopy ft ∈ FI(S, A∗) with f0 = f and f1 = ˜f|S such that for for every t ∈ [0, 1], the
map ft is holomorphic near K, arbitrarily uniformly close to f , and it satisﬁes (4.5).

Proof. We begin by considering two special cases.
Case 1. Assume that S = C ∪ I(C) where C is a connected component of S and
C ∩ I(C) = ∅. Let E be the connected component of M containing C; then E ∩ I(E) = ∅
and M = E ∪ I(E). The proof of [13, Theorem 5.3] shows that f|C can be approximated
uniformly on C by holomorphic maps g : E → A∗ such that (f − g)θ is exact on C. Setting
˜f = g on E and ˜f = g ◦ I on I(E) we are done.
Case 2. Assume that the I-admissible set S = K ∪ Γ is connected, and hence K 6= ∅ (see
Deﬁnition 4.1).

If Γ = ∅, it sufﬁces to apply Proposition 3.19 to the pair of domains K ⊂ M.
Assume now that Γ 6= ∅. We can write Γ = Γ′ ∪ I(Γ′) where Γ′ is union of connected
components of Γ and Γ′ ∩ I(Γ′) = ∅; such a decomposition exists since every connected
component γ of Γ is a Jordan arc with γ ∩ I(γ) = ∅. Take a small compact neighborhood
B′ of Γ′ such that Γ′ is a strong deformation retract of B′, B′ ∩ I(B′) = ∅ and, setting
B = B′ ∪ I(B′), (K, B) is a special I-invariant Cartan pair (see Deﬁnition 3.6).
In
particular, K ∪ B is a strong deformation retract of M and each connected component
of B is a closed disk enclosing a unique component of Γ. See Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1. The Cartan pair (K, B).

Fix a number ǫ > 0. We wish to ﬁnd ˜f ∈ OI(M, A∗) such that ||f − ˜f||0,S < ǫ and
(f − ˜f )θ is exact on S. It sufﬁces to explain how to ﬁnd a map ˜f ∈ OI(K ∪ B, A∗) with
the stated properties since we can extend the solution (by approximation) from K ∪ B to
M by Proposition 3.19.

Reasoning as in the proof of Proposition 3.12, we construct a dominating and period
dominating (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic spray F : S × rBm → A∗ of the form (3.16)
with the core F (· , 0) = f for some r > 0 and m ∈ N. The period map P, to which the
period domination of the spray F refers to, is associated to the 1-form θ and a I-basis B+
of H1(S; Z); cf. (2.23). Decreasing r > 0 if necessary, we may assume that
(4.6)

||F (·, ζ) − f||0,S < ǫ/2

for all ζ ∈ rBm.

||F − G||0,(S∩B)×rBm < δ.

We claim that for every δ > 0 there exists a spray G : B × rBm → A∗ of class AI,I0(B)

satisfying
(4.7)
To see this, note that the pair S ∩ B′ ⊂ B′ satisﬁes the classical Mergelyan approximation
theorem, i.e., every continuous function on S∩B′ that is holomorphic on ˚S∩B′ = ˚K∩B′ is
a uniform limit of functions holomorphic on B′. Furthermore, since B′ deformation retracts
onto S ∩ B′, the same holds for maps to any Oka manifold, in particular, to the null quadric
A∗.
(This follows by combining the local Mergelyan theorem for maps to an arbitrary
complex manifold, cf. [39, Theorem 3.7.2], and the Runge approximation theorem for maps
to Oka manifolds, cf. [39, Theorem 5.4.4].) In the case at hand, we can get approximating
sprays G simply by approximating the core map f and the coefﬁcient functions hi in (2.23)
by holomorphic maps on B′. We extend G to I(B′) × rBm by simmetrization (cf. (3.22))
so as to make it (I, I0)-invariant.

Let r′ ∈ (0, r) be as in Proposition 3.7; recall that r′ can be chosen to depend only on F .
Pick a number η ∈ (0, ǫ/2). If δ > 0 in (4.7) is chosen sufﬁciently small, then Proposition
3.7 furnishes a (I, I0)-invariant spray H : (K ∪ B) × r′Bm → A∗ of class A (K ∪ B)
satisfying
(4.8)
Furthermore, the proof of Proposition 3.7 shows that H|B×r′ Bm is of the form

||H − F||0,K×r′Bm < η.

H(p, ζ) = G(p, ζ + b(p, ζ)),

(p, ζ) ∈ B × r′Bm

||H − F||0,(S∩B)×r′ Bm < η.

for some holomorphic map b : B × r′Bm → Cm with small sup-norm depending only on
the constant δ in (4.7). Since G is δ-close to F over S × rBm (cf. (4.7)), it follows that for
δ > 0 small enough we also have
(4.9)
Since the spray F is period dominating on S, the estimates (4.8) and (4.9) show that for
η > 0 small enough there is a point ζ0 ∈ Rm ∩ r′Bm such that the map ˜f = H(·, ζ0) ∈
AI(K ∪ B, A∗) satisﬁes P( ˜f ) = P(f ), which means that the 1-form ( ˜f − f )θ is exact
on S. By combining the estimates (4.6), (4.8), (4.9) and η < ǫ/2, we conclude that
||f − ˜f||0,S < ǫ, thereby completing the proof in Case 2. The existence of a homotopy
ft ∈ FI(S, A∗) connecting f0 = f to f1 = ˜f|S can be seen as in the proof of Lemma 3.18.
Indeed, the
argument in Case 1 applies to every pair of connected components C, I(C) of S such

The case of a general S follows by combining the above two cases.

that C ∩ I(C) = ∅, whereas the one in Case 2 applies to every I-invariant component of
S.

(cid:3)

The inductive step in the proof of Theorem 4.5 is given by the following lemma.

Lemma 4.7. Let j ∈ N. Each map fj ∈ OI(Mj, A∗) satisfying Rγ fjθ = q(γ) for all
γ ∈ H1(Mj ; Z) can be approximated uniformly on Mj by maps fj+1 ∈ OI(Mj+1, A∗)
satisfyingRγ fj+1θ = q(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(Mj+1; Z).
Proof. We distinguish cases.
The noncritical case: ρ has no critical points in Mj+1 \ ˚Mj. In this case, Mj is a strong
deformation retract of Mj+1 and the result is given by Proposition 3.19.
The critical case, index 0: ρ has critical points pj and I(pj) in Mj+1 \ ˚Mj with Morse
index equal to 0. In this case, two new simply connected components C and I(C) of the
sublevel set {ρ ≤ t} appear at pj and I(pj) when ρ passes the value ρ(pj) = ρ(I(pj )), with
C ∩ I(C) = ∅. Deﬁne efj on Mj by efj = fj, on C as any holomorphic map into A∗, and
on I(C) so as to make it I-invariant, i.e. efj(p) = efj(I(p)) for all p ∈ I(C). This reduces
the proof to the noncritical case.
The critical case, index 1: ρ has two critical points pj and I(pj) in ˚Mj+1 \ Mj with Morse
index equal to 1. In this case, the change of topology of the sublevel set {ρ ≤ t} at pj and
I(pj) is described by attaching to Mj smooth disjoint arcs α and I(α) in ˚Mj+1 \ ˚Mj, with
endpoints in bMj and otherwise disjoint from Mj. Set

(4.10)
Let pα, qα ∈ bMj denote the endpoints of α; hence, I(pα), I(qα) are the endpoints of I(α).
There are four possibilities for the change of topology from Mj to Sj, depending on the

Sj := Mj ∪ α ∪ I(α) ⋐ Mj+1.

number and character of the connected components of Mj that the arc α is attached to:
(i) Assume that {pα, qα} is contained in a connected component C of Mj.

(i.1) If C is I-invariant, then {I(pα), I(qα)} ⊂ C and H1(Sj; Z) contains two new
closed curves which do not lie in H1(Mj ; Z). A detailed discussion of the
topology of Sj in this case can be found in [20, Remark 5.8 and Figures 2, 3,
and 4].

(i.2) If C is not I-invariant, then {I(pα), I(qα)} ⊂ I(C) and H1(Sj; Z) contains two
new closed curves which do not lie in H1(Mj; Z), one contained in H1(C∪α; Z)
and the other one in H1(I(C) ∪ I(α); Z). See Figure 4.2.

(ii) Assume that the endpoints pα and qα of α lie in different connected components C1

and C2 of Mj.

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

51

(ii.1) If either C2 = I(C1) or C1 and C2 are I-invariant, then C1 ∪ C2 is I-invariant
and it follows that H1(Sj; Z) contains a single new closed curve which does not
lie in H1(Mj; Z). See Figure 4.3.

(ii.2) If C2 6= I(C1) and either C1 or C2 (or both) is not I-invariant, then C1 ∪ C2 is
not I-invariant. In this case, no new closed curves appear and the homology of
Sj coincides with the one of Mj. See Figure 4.4.

Figure 4.2. Case (i.2).

Figure 4.3. Case (ii.1).

In any of the cases described above, the set Sj deﬁned by (4.10) is a strong deformation
retract of Mj+1, and we may further assume that it is I-admissible in the sense of Deﬁnition
4.1.

Now, we extend fj to a function efj ∈ FI(Sj, A∗) such that Rγ efjθ = q(γ) for
every closed curve γ ⊂ Sj.
efj ∈ FI(Sj, A∗) of fj.) For that, we ﬁx an orientation on α, extend fj to α so thatRα efjθ
has the required value (see [13, proof of Theorem 5.3]), and deﬁne efj(p) = efj(I(p)) for all
p ∈ I(α). Reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 4.6 we conclude the proof.

(In case (ii.2) the latter condition holds for any extension

Left: C1 = I(C1) and C2 6= I(C2). Right: C1 6= I(C1) and C2 6= I(C2).

Using Lemmas 4.6 and 4.7, it is straightforward to ﬁnd a sequence fj ∈ OI(Mj, A∗)
converging to a map h ∈ OI(N , A∗) which approximates f on S as close as desired and
satisfyiesRγ hθ = q(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(N ; Z). Likewise, the homotopies from fj to fj+1
obtained in each step can be used to get a homotopy ft ∈ FI(S, A∗) (t ∈ [0, 1]) satisfying
the conclusion of Theorem 4.5.

4.2. A Mergelyan theorem with ﬁxed components. In this subsection, we prove the
following version of Mergelyan theorem for conformal non-orientable minimal surfaces
in Rn, n ≥ 3, in which n − 2 components of the immersion are preserved provided that
they extend harmonically to the source Riemann surface. This will be useful in subsequent
applications.
Theorem 4.8. Assume that (N , I, θ) is a standard triple (2.25). Let S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N
be an I-admissible subset, and let (X, f θ) ∈ GCMIn
I (S) be a generalized I-invariant
conformal minimal immersion for some n ≥ 3 (cf. Deﬁnition 4.2). Write X = (Xj)n
j=1 and
f = (fj)n
j=1. Assume that for each j = 3, . . . , n the function Xj extends harmonically to
N , fj = 2∂Xj /θ ∈ OI(N ), and the functionPn
j does not vanish identically on N
and has no zeros on Γ. Let p : H1(N ; Z) → Rn be a group homomorphism such that
p(γ) = Flux(X,f θ)(γ) for every closed curve γ ⊂ S.

p ◦ I∗ = −p and

Then, (X, f θ) can be approximated in the C 1(S)-topology (see Deﬁnition 4.3) by I-

invariant conformal minimal immersions eX = (eXj)n
on N for j = 3, . . . , n and Flux eX = p.

Note that the set Γ could be empty; hence, the assumption thatPn
j does not vanish
anywhere on Γ need not imply thatPn
j is not identically zero on N . We point out
that the latter condition is necessary in the theorem. Indeed, ifPn
j = 0 identically
on N then the arising functions eX1 and eX2 would be constant on N (since the only map
(∂eX1/θ, ∂eX2/θ) ∈ OI(N , C2) satisfying (∂eX1/θ)2 + (∂eX2/θ)2 = −4Pn
j = 0
identically on N is the constant (0, 0) ∈ C2 in view of (2.2)). Hence, their ﬂuxes equal to
zero, thereby imposing extra a priori conditions on X and p.

Theorem 4.8 was proved for n = 3 in [20] by using the L´opez-Ros transformation for
conformal minimal surfaces in R3, a tool which is not available in higher dimensions. On
the other hand, a result analogous to Theorem 4.8 in the orientable framework was proved
in [8] for any n ≥ 3. The deformation procedure used in the latter paper does not work in
the non-orientable case and hence we need here a different approach.

We begin with some preparations.

Lemma 4.9. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26). Every h ∈ OI(N ) \ {0} can be written
in the form h = f 2

2 with (f1, f2) ∈ OI(N , C2 \ {0}).

1 + f 2

Note that the lemma fails for the zero function h = 0 since by (2.2) the only map
2 = 0 identically on N is the constant (0, 0) ∈ C2.
(f1, f2) ∈ OI(N , C2) satisfying f 2
Proof. For simplicity of notation we shall identify a path γ in N with its support |γ| when
considering maps deﬁned on the set |γ|.

1 + f 2

α0 ∩ δj = ∅, α0 ∩ I(δj) = ∅, and δj ∩ I(δj) = ∅ for j = 2, . . . , l.

Fix a Runge I-basis B = {α0, δ2, I(δ2), . . . δl, I(δl)} of H1(N ; Z) as in (2.8), (2.9),
(2.10); in particular, |B| is a strong deformation retract of N . Recall that α0 is the only
curve in B such that I(α0) = α0, and we have
(4.11)
Since h is holomorphic and does not vanish identically on N , we may assume by general
position (choosing the curves in B in a suitable way) that h has no zeros on |B|. Since
h ◦ I = ¯h, the function τ : α0 → S1 = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} given by τ = h/|h| satisﬁes
τ· (τ ◦ I) = 1 everywhere on α0, and hence τ has topological degree equal to zero. This
implies that h|α0 : α0 → C \ {0} has a well deﬁned square root h0 : α0 → C \ {0}. Since
h is I-invariant and h2
0 = h|α0, we have that either h0 ◦ I = h0 (i.e., h0 is I-invariant) or
h0 ◦ I = −h0 (i.e., ih0 is I-invariant).
Claim 4.10. It sufﬁces to prove the lemma under the assumption that h0 is I-invariant.

Proof. Assume for a moment that the lemma holds whenever h0 ◦ I = h0, and suppose
that h0 ◦ I = −h0. By [20, Lemma 4.6] there exists a function g ∈ O(N ) satisfying
g· (g ◦ I) = −1 on N . Since ih0 is a I-invariant square root of −h|α0, by our assumption
there exists a map (u1, u2) ∈ OI(N , C2\{0}) satisfying u2
2 = −h on N . A calculation

then shows that the map (f1, f2) given by

i

belongs to OI(N , C2 \ {0}) and satisﬁes f 2

1 + f 2

2 = h. This proves the claim.

(cid:3)

Assume now that h0 is an I-invariant square root of h|α0. Consider the smooth function

v : |B| → C deﬁned as follows:
v|α0 = h0,

v|Sl

j=2 δj

= h,

v|Sl

j=2 I(δj ) = 1.

v· (v ◦ I) = h||B|.

Note that v is well deﬁned in view of (4.11) and it satisﬁes the following equation:
(4.12)
Since h is I-invariant and does not vanish anywhere on |B|, the divisor of h can be written
in the form (h) = D + I(D) where
supp(D) ∩ supp(I(D)) = ∅ and (cid:0)supp(D) ∪ supp(I(D))(cid:1) ∩ |B| = ∅.
(4.13)
By (4.12), v has no zeros on |B|. Since |B| is Runge in N , we may approximate v uniformly
on |B| by holomorphic functions w ∈ O(N ) with (w) = D. It follows that the function

ϕ :=

w· (w ◦ I)

h

∈ OI(N , C \ {0})

does not vanish anywhere on N and is close to 1 on |B| in view of (4.12).
If the
approximation of v by w is close enough on |B|, then ϕ||B| is so close to 1 that it has a
I-invariant square root. As |B| is a strong deformation retract of N and ϕ has no zeroes
on N , ϕ has a holomorphic I-invariant square root ϕ0 : N → C \ {0} as well. Hence, the
function w0 := w/ϕ0 ∈ O(N ) satisﬁes w0· (w0 ◦ I) = h. Equivalently, the I-invariant
holomorphic functions on N given by

f1 =

1

2(cid:0)w0 + w0 ◦ I(cid:1),

f2 =

i

2(cid:0)w0 − w0 ◦ I(cid:1),

1 + f 2

2 = h. Finally, since (w0) = (w) = D and (w0 ◦ I) = (w ◦ I) = I(D),

satisfy f 2
(4.13) ensures that f1 and f2 have no common zeroes.
Lemma 4.11. Assume that (N , I, θ) is a standard triple (2.25) and the Riemann surface N
has ﬁnite topology. Let S = K∪Γ ⊂ N be a I-admissible set, and let (f1, f2) ∈ FI(S, C2)
(cf. (4.1)) be such that the function h := f 2
2 does not vanish anywhere on bS = Γ∪ bK
and it extends to a function h ∈ OI(N ). Then (f1, f2) can be approximated uniformly on
S by I-invariant holomorphic maps (ef1,ef2) : N → C2 satisfying the following conditions:
(i) the 1-form (efj − fj) θ is exact on S for j = 1, 2;
(ii) ef 2

eΓ consists of a collection of Jordan arcs such that eS is a strong deformation retract of N and
h does not vanish anywhere oneΓ (this is possible by general position). Then, we extend f1
and f2 to eS as arbitrary functions of class FI(eS) satisfying f 2
Since the function h ∈ OI(N ) has no zeros on bS = bK ∪ Γ, there exists a Runge
I-basis B of H1(N ; Z) such that |B| ⊂ S and h has no zeros on |B| (see (2.8) and (2.9)).
Recall that h|S = f 2

that f 2

anywhere on this set. Let φ denote the ﬂow of V . Reasoning as in the proof of Proposition
3.12, we ﬁnd I-invariant holomorphic functions h1, . . . , hm : S → C for some m ∈ N such
that the spray F = (F1, F2, F3, F4) : S × U → A∗ with the core f , given by

where U ⊂ Cm is a ball around 0 ∈ Cm, satisﬁes the following properties:
(i) F is smooth, (I, I0)-invariant, and of class A (S).

map (2.23) with respect to the 1-form θ and the I-basis B.

Recall that the function h|S = f 2

2 = (f1 − if2)(f1 + if2) is I-invariant and does
not vanish anywhere on bS. Let D1 = (f1 − if2) denote the divisor of f1 − if2 on S; note

1 + f 2

56

A. Alarc´on, F. Forstneriˇc, and F. J. L´opez

that D1 is supported on ˚K. Since (f1 − if2) ◦ I = f1 + if2, we have (f1 + if2) = I(D1)
and

D0 := supp(D1) ∩ supp(I(D1)) = {p ∈ S : f1(p) = f2(p) = 0} ⊂ ˚K.

(4.15)
In particular, (h|S ) = D1 + I(D1). Since h is I-invariant and I(S) = S, we also have
(h|N \S ) = D2 + I(D2) with supp(D2) ∩ supp(I(D2)) = ∅. Setting D = D1 + D2, we
have (h) = D + I(D) and supp(D) ∩ supp(I(D)) = D0 (cf. 4.15).
It follows from (4.14) that for every ζ ∈ U we have a factorization
h|S = (F1(·, ζ) − iF2(·, ζ)) · (F1(·, ζ) + iF2(·, ζ)) .

Since the divisors D1,ζ := (F1(·, ζ) − iF2(·, ζ)) and D2,ζ := (F2(·, ζ) + iF2(·, ζ)) on S
depend continuously on ζ ∈ U and we have D1,ζ + D2,ζ = (h|S ) = D1 + I(D1) and
D1,0 = D1, D2,0 = I(D1), we conclude that

(F1(·, ζ) − iF2(·, ζ)) = D1 and (F1(·, ζ) + iF2(·, ζ)) = I(D1) for all ζ ∈ U .

By the Oka Property with Approximation and Interpolation (cf. [39, Theorem 5.4.4]), we
may approximate the function F1− iF2 : S× U → C uniformly on S× U by a holomorphic
function G : N × U → C with the divisor (G(·, ζ)) = D for every ζ ∈ U. (The parameter
ball U ⊂ Cm is allowed to shrink slightly. For maps to C, this result reduces to the
combination of the classical Cartan extension theorem and the Oka-Weil approximation
theorem for holomorphic functions on Stein manifolds.) By I-invariance, it follows that
the function (p, ζ) 7→ G(I(p), ζ) approximates F1 + iF2 uniformly on S × U and satisﬁes
(G(I(· ), ¯ζ )) = I(D) for every ζ ∈ U. Consider the (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic function
H : N × U → C deﬁned by

H(p, ζ) = G(p, ζ)· G(I(p), ζ)).

By the construction, the divisor of H(· , ζ) equals D + I(D) = (h) for every ζ ∈ U.
Hence, the function N × U ∋ (p, ζ) 7→ h(p)/H(p, ζ) is holomorphic, it does not vanish
anywhere on N × U, and it is uniformly close to 1 on S × U provided that G is close to
F1 − iF2 there. Assuming that the approximation is close enough, the function h/H has
a well deﬁned (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic square root H0 on S × U, and hence also on
N × U since S is a strong deformation retract of N . For p ∈ N and ζ ∈ U we set

H0(p, ζ)(cid:0)G(p, ζ) + G(I(p), ζ)(cid:1),
H0(p, ζ)(cid:0)G(p, ζ) − G(I(p), ζ)(cid:1).
Clearly, (eF1,eF2) is a (I, I0)-invariant holomorphic map satisfying
Furthermore, for every ζ ∈ U the zero set of the pair(cid:0)eF1(·, ζ), eF2(·, ζ)(cid:1) coincides with the
one of(cid:0)G(·, ζ), (G ◦ I)(·, ζ)(cid:1), namely D0 (cf. (4.15)). In other words, the common zeroes

two components. Hence, if all approximations made in the process are close enough,
there is a point ζ0 ∈ U ∩ Rm close to 0 such that the I-invariant holomorphic map
(ef1,ef2) = (eF1(·, ζ0), eF2(·, ζ0)) : N → C2 satisﬁes the conclusion of Lemma 4.11.
amounts to a recursive application of Lemma 4.11.
Theorem 4.12. Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25) and S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N be a I-
admissible subset. Assume that f = (f1, f2) ∈ FI(S, C2) is such that f 2

holomorphic function h ∈ OI(N ) which does vanish identically on N and has no zeros on
bK ∪ Γ, and let q : H1(N ; Z) → C2 be a group homomorphism satisfying

Proof. Let S ⋐ M1 ⋐ M2 ⋐ ··· ⋐S∞
i=1 Mi = N be an exhaustion of N as in the proof
of Theorem 4.5. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 4.5 but using Lemma 4.11 instead of
Proposition 3.19, we may construct a sequence of maps gk := (gk,1, gk,2) ∈ OI(Mk, C2)
such that for all k ∈ N we have
k,2 = h on Mk,

• g2
• Rγ gkθ = q(γ) for all γ ∈ H1(Mk; Z), and
• the zero divisor of gk on Mk equals the divisor of f on S (in particular, gk does not
vanish anywhere on Mk \ ˚K).

Indeed, we can choose all I-admissible sets Sj = Mj ∪ α ∪ I(α) involved in the recursive
construction (see (4.10)) such that h does not vanish anywhere on bMj ∪ α ∪ I(α); this is
possible by general position since h is holomorphic and does not vanish identically on N .
Moreover, for each k ∈ N we may choose gk+1 close enough to gk uniformly on Mk so that
the sequence {gk}k∈N converges to a map ef ∈ OI(N , C2) which approximates f on S and
the zero locus of ef on N equals the zero locus of f on S.
Proof of Theorem 4.8. Let (N , I, θ), S, (X, f θ), and p = (pj)n

of the theorem. By the argument in the proof of Theorem 4.5, we may assume that S is

extends to an I-invariant holomorphic function on N that does vanish identically and has
no zeros on Γ. Up to slightly enlarging the compact set K (and hence S), we may also
assume that h does not vanish anywhere on bS = (bK) ∪ Γ. Theorem 4.12, applied to
the map (f1, f2) : S → C2 and the group homomorphism q : H1(N ; Z) → C2 given by
q(γ) = i(p1, p2)(γ), provides maps (ef1,ef2) ∈ OI(N , C2) which approximate (f1, f2)
uniformly on S and satisfy the following conditions:

A∗ is the punctured null quadric in Cn.

In particular, the map ef := (ef1,ef2, f3, . . . , fn) : N → A∗ belongs to OI(N , A∗), where
It follows that ℜ(ef θ) is exact on N . Fix a
point p0 ∈ S. The I-invariant conformal minimal immersions eX : N → R3 given by

The following result generalizes Lemma 4.9 to surfaces with arbitrary topology.

5. A GENERAL POSITION THEOREM FOR NON-ORIENTABLE MINIMAL SURFACES

In this subsection, we prove Theorem 1.4 stated in the Introduction.
Let N be an open or bordered non-orientable surface endowed with a conformal
structure, and let π : N → N be an oriented 2-sheeted covering of N with the deck
transformation I. Then, N is an open (or bordered) Riemann surface and I : N → N is an
antiholomorphic ﬁxed-point-free involution, and a conformal minimal immersion X : N →
Rn is uniquely determined by a I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn by
X = X ◦ π (see Subsec. 2.1). Hence, Theorem 1.4 follows immediately from the following
more precise result concerning I-invariant conformal minimal immersions N → Rn.
Theorem 5.1. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26).
If n ≥ 5 then every I-invariant
conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn can be approximated uniformly on compacts
by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions eX : N → Rn such that FluxX = Flux eX
and for all p, q ∈ N we have
(5.1)

eX(p) = eX(q) ⇐⇒ p = q or I(p) = q.

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

59

If n = 4 then the approximating maps eX can be chosen such that the equation eX(p) =
eX(q) may in addition hold for a discrete sequence of pairs (pj, qj) ∈ N × N such that
qj /∈ {pj, I(pj )} for all j.
The same result holds if N is a compact bordered Riemann surface and X is of class
C r(N ) for some r ∈ N; in such case, the approximation takes place in the C r(N ) topology,
and for every n ≥ 3 we can approximate X by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions
eX : N → Rn satisfying Condition (5.1) for points p, q ∈ bN in the boundary of N .
Proof. Consider the subset of N × N given by
(5.2)
Since I has no ﬁxed points, D is a disjoint union D = DM ∪ DI of the diagonal
DM := {(p, p) ∈ N × N : p ∈ N} and of DI := {(p, I(p)) ∈ N × N : p ∈ N}.

D = {(p, q) ∈ N × N : p = q or I(p) = q}.

To any I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn we associate the

difference map δX : N × N → Rn given by

Then, X satisﬁes Condition (5.1) if and only if

δX(p, q) = X(p) − X(q),

p, q ∈ M.

(δX)−1(0) = D.

Likewise, X satisﬁes Condition (5.1) on the boundary bN if and only if

(δX|bN ×bN )−1(0) = D ∩ (bN × bN ).

We ﬁrst consider the case when N is a compact Riemann surface with nonempty
boundary and X is of class C r(N ) for some r ∈ N.
In view of Corollary 3.21 and
standard results (see e.g. Stout [85]), we may assume that N is a smoothly bounded I-
invariant domain in an open Riemann surface R, the involution I extends to a ﬁxed-point-
free antiholomorphic involution on R, and X is a I-invariant conformal minimal immersion
on an open neighborhood of N in R. This allows us to replace the integer r by a possibly
bigger number such that the transversality arguments used in remainder of the proof apply.
Since X is an immersion, it is locally injective, and hence there is an open neighborhood
U ⊂ N ×N of the set D given by (5.2) such that δX does not assume the value 0 ∈ Rn on
U \D. To prove the theorem, it sufﬁces to approximate X sufﬁciently closely in C 1(N , Rn)
by a I-invariant conformal minimal immersion eX : N → Rn with Flux eX = FluxX
such that the difference map δeX : N × N → Rn is transverse to the origin 0 ∈ Rn on
N × N \ U, and its restriction to bN × bN is transverse to 0 on bN × bN \ U. Indeed, if
n > 4 = dimR N × N , this will imply by dimension reasons that δeX 6= 0 on N × N \ U,
and hence eX(p) 6= eX(q) if (p, q) ∈ N × N \ U. The same argument shows that δeX 6= 0
on bN × bN \ U for every n ≥ 3. Finally, if n = 4 then δeX may assume the value 0 ∈ R4
in at most ﬁnitely many points (pj, qj) ∈ N × N \ U, and we may further arrange that the
tangent planes to the immersed surface eX(N ) ⊂ R4 at pj and qj intersect transversely. If

theorem.

on the other hand (p, q) ∈ U \ D, then eX(p) 6= eX(q) provided that eX is sufﬁciently close
to X in C 1(N ). Hence, a map eX with these properties will satisfy the conclusion of the
To ﬁnd such maps eX, we construct a neighborhood Ω ⊂ RN of the origin in a high
dimensional Euclidean space and a real analytic map H : Ω × N → Rn satisfying the
following properties:
(a) H(0,· ) = X,
(b) for every ξ ∈ Ω, the map H(ξ,· ) : N → Rn is a I-invariant conformal minimal
(c) the difference map δH : Ω × N × N → Rn, deﬁned by

immersion of class C r(N ) whose ﬂux homomorphism equals that of X, and

δH(ξ, p, q) = H(ξ, q) − H(ξ, p),

ξ ∈ Ω, p, q ∈ N ,

is such that the partial differential ∂ξ|ξ=0 δH(ξ, p, q) : RN → Rn is surjective for
every (p, q) ∈ N × N \ U.

Assume for a moment that a map H with these properties exists. It follows from (c) and
compactness of N × N \ U that the differential ∂ξ(δH) is surjective at all points ξ in a
neighborhood Ω′ ⊂ Ω of the origin in RN . Hence, the map δH : Ω × (N × N \ U ) → Rn
is transverse to any submanifold of Rn, in particular, to the origin 0 ∈ Rn. The standard
transversality argument (cf. Abraham [1] or [39, Section 7.8]) shows that for a generic
choice of ξ ∈ Ω′, the map δH(ξ,· ,· ) is transverse to 0 ∈ Rn on N × N \ U and on
bN × bN \ U. By choosing ξ sufﬁciently close to 0 ∈ RN , we obtain an I-invariant
conformal minimal immersion eX = H(ξ,· ) : N ֒→ Rn close to X which satisﬁes the
conclusion of the theorem.

We can ﬁnd a map H satisfying properties (a)–(c) by following the construction in [13,
Theorem 4.1], but with a minor difference that we shall now explain. The main step is given
by the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2. Let D ⊂ N ×N be given by (5.2). For every (p, q) ∈ N ×N \ D there exists
a spray H = H (p,q)(ξ,· ) : N → Rn of I-invariant conformal minimal immersions of class
C r(N ), depending analytically on the parameter ξ in a neighborhood of the origin in Rn,
satisfying properties (a) and (b) above, but with (c) replaced by the following condition:

(c’) the partial differential ∂ξ|ξ=0 δH(ξ, p, q) : Rn → Rn is an isomorphism.

Proof. This can be seen by following [13, proof of Lemma 4.3], but performing all steps by
I-invariant functions. We include a brief outline.

Since q /∈ {p, I(p)}, there exists a smooth embedded arc Λ ⊂ N with the endpoints
p and q such that Λ ∩ I(Λ) = ∅. Let λ : [0, 1] → Λ be a smooth parameterization. Fix
a nowhere vanishing I-invariant holomorphic 1-form θ on N . Choose a homology basis
B = B+ ∪ B− as in (2.10), (2.11) such that

Let 2∂X = f θ, so f : N → A∗ ⊂ Cn is an I-invariant map of class A r−1(N ) into the
punctured null quadric. By Proposition 3.12, there are a ball U ⊂ Cm around 0 ∈ Cm
for some big m ∈ N and a (I, I0)-invariant period dominating spray F : N × U → A∗ of
class A r−1(A) with the core F (· , 0) = f . More precisely, if P : A r−1(N , Cn) → (Cn)l
denotes the period map (2.23) associated to the 1-form θ and the homology basis B+, then
the partial differential

∂ζ(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=0P(F (· , ζ)) : Cm −→ (Cn)l

maps Rm (the real part of Cm) surjectively onto Rn × (Cn)l−1.

Consider (I, I0)-invariant sprays Ψ : N × Cn → A∗ of the form (3.5):

Ψ(x, ξ1, . . . , ξn) = φ1

ξ1h1(x) ◦ φ2

ξ2h2(x) ◦ ··· ◦ φn

ξnhn(x)(f (x)),

x ∈ N ,

where each φi is the ﬂow of some linear holomorphic vector ﬁeld Vi of type (3.6) on Cn,
ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ Cn, and h1, . . . , hn are I-invariant holomorphic functions on N to be
determined. We have that
∂Ψ(x, ξ)

= hi(x) Vi(f (x)),

x ∈ N , i = 1, . . . , n.

We choose the coefﬁcient functions hi ∈ A r−1
while on the arc Λ they are determined so that the real vectors

i = 1, . . . , n

span Rn as a real vector space. The construction of such functions hi is explained in [13,
proof of Lemma 4.3]. We begin by ﬁnding smooth I-invariant functions hi with these
properties on the system of curves |B|∪ Λ∪ I(Λ), taking into account (5.3) and applying I-
simmetrization. Since the set |B|∪ Λ∪ I(Λ) is Runge in N , we obtain desired holomorphic
functions on N by Mergelyan approximation theorem.

Since the functions hi are small on |B|, the complex periods of the maps Ψ(· , ξ) : N →

A∗ are close to those of f = Ψ(· , 0) = F (· , 0). Consider the map

Φ(x, ξ, ζ) = φ1

ξ1h1(x) ◦ ··· ◦ φn

ξnhn(x)(F (x, ζ))

deﬁned for x ∈ N , ζ ∈ U ⊂ Cm and ξ ∈ Cn. By the period domination property of F and
the implicit function theorem, there is a real valued map ζ = ζ(ξ) ∈ Rm for ξ ∈ Rn near
the origin, with ζ(0) = 0, such that, setting

G(x, ξ) = Φ(x, ξ, ζ(ξ)) ∈ A∗,

x ∈ N , ξ ∈ Rn near 0,

the periods of the I-invariant holomorphic maps G(· , ξ) : N → A∗ over the curves in the
homology basis B+ = {δ1, . . . , δl} are independent of ξ, and hence they equal those of
G(· , 0) = f . In particular, their real periods vanish since f = 2∂X/θ. Hence, the integrals

give a well deﬁned family of I-invariant conformal minimal immersions N → Rn
satisfying H(0,· ) = X and FluxH(ξ,·) = FluxX for all ξ ∈ Rn near 0. Furthermore,

δH(ξ, p, q) = H(ξ, q) − H(ξ, p) = ℜZΛ

G(· , ξ) θ.

By the chain rule, taking into account that the functions hi are close to 0 on |B|, we see that
∂ξiδH(ξ, p, q)|ξ=0 is close to the expression in (5.4) so that these vectors for i = 1, . . . , n
span Rn. This shows that H satisﬁes the conclusion of the lemma. For the details we refer
to [13, proof of Lemma 4.3].
(cid:3)

The construction of a map H satisfying properties (a)–(c) is then completed as in [13,
proof of Theorem 4.1] by taking a composition of ﬁnitely many sprays of the kind furnished
by Lemma 5.2. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.1 if N is a bordered Riemann
surface.

Assume now that (N , I) is an open Riemann surface with involution, K is a compact set
in N , and X : N → Rn is a I-invariant conformal minimal immersion for some n ≥ 5.
Choose an exhaustion M1 ⋐ M2 ⋐ ··· ⋐ ∪∞
j=1Mj = N by compact, smoothly bounded,
I-invariant Runge domains such that K ⋐ M1. By the already proved case, we can ﬁnd
X1 ∈ CMIn
I (M1) (see (2.24)) which satisﬁes Condition (5.1) on M1, it approximates
X as closely as desired on M1 ⊃ K, and such that FluxX1 = FluxX|M1
. Note that
any X′ ∈ CMIn
I (M1) which is sufﬁciently close to X1 in the C 1(M1) topology also
satisﬁes Condition (5.1). By Runge-Mergelyan theorem for I-invariant conformal minimal
immersions (cf. Theorem 4.4), there exists X2 ∈ CMIn
I (N ) which approximates X1 as
closely as desired on M1 and satisﬁes FluxX2|M2
. (Note that we applied the
cited theorem with respect to the group homomorphism p = FluxX : H1(N ; Z) → Rn.)
By general position, we may also assume that X2 satisﬁes Condition (5.1) on M2.

= FluxX|M2

Clearly this process can be continued recursively, yielding a sequence Xj ∈ CMIn
I (N )
such that for every j = 1, 2, . . ., Xj satisﬁes Condition (5.1) on Mj, FluxXj|Mj
=
: H1(Mj; Z) → Rn, and Xj approximates Xj−1 on Mj−1 (the last condition

being vacuous for j = 1). If the approximation is sufﬁciently close at every step, then the
(cid:3)

limit eX = limj→∞ Xj : N → Rn satisﬁes the conclusion of Theorem 5.1.

6. APPLICATIONS

In this section, we give a number of applications of the construction methods obtained
in the previous sections, thereby showing their power and versatility. The analogous results
for orientable minimal surfaces are already known and, with the corresponding construction
techniques in hand, the proofs in the non-orientable case are similar to those for orientable
surfaces.

On the one hand, we prove general existence and approximation results for non-
orientable minimal surfaces in Rn, n ≥ 3, with arbitrary conformal structure and global

properties such as completeness or properness, among others; see Subsec. 6.1 and 6.2. On
the other hand, we furnish several existence and approximation results for complete non-
orientable minimal surfaces in Rn which are bounded or proper in certain subdomains of
Rn; see Subsec. 6.3 and 6.4. These boundedness conditions impose restrictions on the
source Riemann surface, and hence we consider in this case only surfaces normalized by
bordered Riemann surfaces.

6.1. Proper non-orientable minimal surfaces. Due to classical results, it was generally
believed that properness in R3 strongly inﬂuences the conformal properties of minimal
surfaces. For instance, Sullivan conjectured that there are no properly immersed minimal
surfaces in R3 with ﬁnite topology and hyperbolic conformal type.
(An open Riemann
surface is said to be hyperbolic if it carries non-constant negative subharmonic functions,
and parabolic otherwise; cf. [36].) The ﬁrst counterexample to this conjecture – a conformal
disk – was given by Morales [77]; the problem was completely solved by Alarc´on and L´opez
in [14] who constructed oriented properly immersed minimal surfaces in R3 with arbitrary
topological and conformal structure. In the same line, Schoen and Yau [84, p. 18] asked
in 1985 whether there exist hyperbolic minimal surfaces in R3 properly projecting into a
plane; a general afﬁrmative answer to this question was given in [14]. Analogous results in
the non-orientable framework were obtained in [20], using the L´opez-Ros transformation
[71] and other ad hoc techniques for the three dimensional case.

On the other hand, it is well known that R3 contains no properly embedded non-
orientable surfaces due to topological obstructions. Although the obstruction disappears
in higher dimensions, no examples of properly embedded non-orientable minimal surfaces
in R4 seem to be available in the literature.
In R4 = C2 there are properly embedded
complex curves, hence orientable minimal surfaces, with arbitrary topology [18], whereas
it is not known whether every open Riemann surface properly embeds in C2 as a complex
curve or a minimal surface [22]; see [43, 44] for a discussion and recent results on this
long-standing open problem.

We begin by providing an example of a properly embedded M¨obius strip in R4; see
Example 6.1 and Figure 6.1. As mentioned above, this seems to be the ﬁrst known example
of a properly embedded non-orientable minimal surface in R4.

Indeed, a direct computation shows that X ◦ I = I; i.e. X is I-invariant. Moreover, we

which does not vanish anywhere on C∗. A calculation shows that f assumes values in the

deﬁnes a diffeomorphism h : (0, +∞) → R, we infer that X is a proper map. (In fact, the
ﬁrst two components of X provide a proper map C∗ → R2.) Finally, a computation shows
that, if X(ρ1eit1) = X(ρ2eit2) for (ρ1, t1), (ρ2, t2) ∈ (0, +∞)× R then either ρ1 = ρ2 and
t1 = t2 mod 2π (and hence ρ1eit1 = ρ2eit2), or ρ1 = 1

We now give a general embedding result for non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn,
n ≥ 5, with arbitrary conformal structure. To be more precise, given a standard pair (N , I)
and an integer n ≥ 5, we provide I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Y : N → Rn
such that the image surfaces Y (N ) ⊂ Rn are properly embedded non-orientable minimal
surfaces. This is a consequence of the following general approximation result, which is a
more precise version of Theorem 1.6 (i), also contributing to the Sullivan and Schoen-Yau
problems mentioned above.
Theorem 6.2. Let (N , I) be a standard pair (2.26), and let S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N be an
I-admissible set (see Deﬁnition 4.2). Let (X, f θ) ∈ GCMIn
I (S) for some n ≥ 3 (see
(4.4)), and let p : H1(N ; Z) → Rn be a group homomorphism such that p ◦ I∗ = −p and
p|H1(S;Z) = Flux(X,f θ) (see (4.3)). Write X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xn) and choose numbers

0 < β < π/4,

0 < δ < min{(X2 + tan(β)|X1|)(p) : p ∈ S};

recall that S is compact. Then, (X, f θ) may be approximated in the C 1(S)-topology by
I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Y = (Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn) : N → Rn such that
FluxY = p and Y2 + tan(β)|Y1| : N → R is a proper map and is bounded below by δ. In
particular, (Y1, Y2) : N → R2 is also proper.

Furthermore, Y can be chosen such that Y : N → Rn is an embedding if n ≥ 5 and an

immersion with simple double points if n = 4.

The case n = 3 of Theorem 6.2 is proved in [20, Theorem 6.6]. The analogue of
Theorem 6.2 in the orientable case is given in [14] for n = 3 and in [13] for arbitrary
dimension.
In [13] only the properness of the pair (Y1, Y2) is ensured; we point out
that, given β ∈ (0, π/4) and an open Riemann surface M, the arguments in [14] can
easily be adapted to construct conformal minimal immersions (Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn) : M → Rn,
embeddings if n ≥ 5, such that the map Y2 + tan(β)|Y1| : N → R is proper.

The proof of Theorem 6.2 follows the arguments in [20, proof of Theorem 6.6], but using
Theorems 4.4 and 4.8 instead of [20, Theorem 5.6]. We include a brief sketch of the proof
and refer to [20] for details.

Sketch of proof of Theorem 6.2. By Theorem 4.5 we may assume that X extends as an I-
invariant conformal minimal immersion on a tubular neighborhood of S; hence we may
assume without loss of generality that Γ = ∅ and S is a smoothly bounded domain.
Let M0 := S ⋐ M1 ⋐ M2 ⋐ ··· ⋐ S∞
j=1 Mj = N be an exhaustion of N as in
the proof of Theorem 4.5. Set Y 0 := X. The key of the proof consists of constructing a
sequence of I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Y j = (Y j

Rn, j ∈ N, satisfying the following conditions:
(i) Y j is as close as desired to Y j−1 in the C 1(Mj−1) topology.
(ii) FluxY j = p|H1(Mj ;Z).

Such a sequence is constructed recursively. For the inductive step we proceed as in [20,
proof of Theorem 6.6] but using Theorems 4.4 and 4.8 instead of [20, Theorem 5.6],
which provides an immersion satisfying conditions (i)-(iv). The role of the ﬁrst and third
components in [20, Theorem 6.6] is played here by the ﬁrst two ones. In particular, crucial
steps in the proof of the non-critical case in [20] require to apply Mergelyan approximation
to a generalized conformal I-invariant minimal immersion into R3 preserving its component
in a certain direction (to be precise, in the direction of (1, 0, tan(β)) or of (1, 0,− tan(β));
cf. [20, Equation (39)]). In our case, we use Theorem 4.8 at these crucial points to obtain
approximation preserving the component in the direction of (1, tan(β), 0, . . . , 0) (resp.
(1,− tan(β), 0, . . . , 0)) and also any other n − 3 components among the last n − 2 ones.
Finally, Property (v) is guaranteed by Theorem 1.4.

If the approximation of Y j−1 by Y j in (i) is sufﬁciently close for all j ∈ N, the sequence
{Y j}j∈N converges uniformly on compacts on N to an I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion Y = (Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn) : N → Rn satisfying the conclusion of the theorem.
Indeed, (i) ensures that Y approximates (X, f θ) as close as desired in the C 1(S)-topology;
(ii) implies that FluxY = p; (iii) and (iv) guarantee that Y2 + tan(β)|Y1| : N → R is a
proper map which is bounded below by δ; and (v) ensures that Y can be chosen such that

6.2. Complete non-orientable minimal surfaces with ﬁxed components. In this subsec-
tion, we prove existence and approximation results for complete non-orientable minimal
surfaces in Rn with arbitrary conformal structure and n − 2 given coordinate functions; see
Corollary 6.4. By using this result, we then derive the existence of complete non-orientable
minimal surfaces in Rn with arbitrary conformal structure and generalized Gauss map omit-
ting n hyperplanes of CPn−1 in general position; see Corollary 6.5.

We begin with the following more precise technical result.

1 + f 2

Theorem 6.3. Let (N , I, θ) be a standard triple (2.25) and let S = K ∪ Γ ⊂ N be an
I-admissible subset (see Deﬁnition 4.1). Let κ : N → R+ = [0, +∞) be an I-invariant
smooth function with isolated zeroes. Let f = (f1, f2) ∈ FI(S, C2) (see (4.1)) be such
that f 2
2 extends to a function h ∈ OI(N ) which does not vanish everywhere on N nor
anywhere on Γ, and let q : H1(N ; Z) → C2 be a group homomorphism such that q◦ I∗ = q
and q(γ) =Rγ f θ for every closed curve γ ⊂ S.
Then, f can be approximated uniformly on S by I-invariant holomorphic maps ef =
2 = h on N ,Rγ ef θ = q(γ) for every closed curve
(ef1,ef2) : N → C2 such that ef 2
γ ⊂ N , the zero locus of ef on N is exactly the one of f on S (in particular, ef has no
zeros on N \ ˚K), and (|ef1|2 +|ef2|2 + κ)|θ|2 is a complete Riemannian metric with isolated
singularities exactly at the zeroes of |f1|2 + |f2|2 + κ.

The analogue of Theorem 6.3 in the orientable case is [8, Theorem 4.4]. The proof
of Theorem 6.3 follows the same arguments as those in [8, proof of Theorem 4.4], but
symmetrizing the construction with respect to the involution I and using Theorem 4.12
instead of [8, Lemma 3.3]. We shall sketch the proof, pointing out the relevant differences
and referring to [8] for complete details.
It is also worth mentioning that the bigger
generality of Theorem 4.12 when compared to [8, Lemma 3.3] (its analogue in the orientable
case) enables us to avoid the assumption that f1 and f2 are linearly independent (cf. [8,
Theorem 4.4 (A)]). Indeed, our proof of Theorem 4.12 can be adapted to the orientable
case in order to improve [8, Lemma 3.3], and all the subsequent results in that paper, by
removing the assumption (A) from its statement.

Sketch of proof of Theorem 6.3. By Theorem 4.12 we may assume that f extends as an I-
invariant holomorphic function on a tubular neighborhood of S; hence we may assume
without loss of generality that Γ = ∅ and S is a smoothly bounded domain.
Let M0 := S ⋐ M1 ⋐ M2 ⋐ ··· ⋐ S∞
j=1 Mj = N be an exhaustion of N
as in the proof of Theorem 4.5. Set g0 = (g0,1, g0,2) := f and ﬁx a point p0 ∈ ˚S.
The key of the proof is to construct a sequence of I-invariant holomorphic functions
gj = (gj,1, gj,2) : Mj → C2 satisfying the following conditions for every j ∈ N:

68

(i) gj is as close as desired to gj−1 in the C 0(Mj−1) topology.
(ii) g2

j,1 + g2

j,2 = h|Mj .

(iii) Rγ gjθ = q(γ) for every closed curve γ ⊂ Mj.
(iv) The zero locus of gj on Mj is exactly the one of f on S. In particular, σ(gj ) :=
(|gj,1|2 + |gj,2|2 + κ)|θ|2 is a Riemannian metric on Mj with isolated singularities
exactly at the zeroes of |f1|2 + |f2|2 + κ on S.

(v) dist(Mj ,σ(gj ))(p0, bMj ) > j.
To construct such a sequence, we reason as in [8, proof of Theorem 4.4] but symmetrizing
the argument with respect to the involution I (as in [20, proof of Theorem 6.8]) and
using Theorem 4.12 instead of [8, Lemma 3.3] and [20, Theorem 5.6]. In particular, for
the non-critical case in the recursive construction, when ˚Mj \ Mj−1 consists of ﬁnitely
many pairwise disjoint annuli, we use I-invariant Jorge-Xavier’s type labyrinths (see [64])
adapted to the nonnegative I-invariant function κ. The latter means that the labyrinth in
each component of ˚Mj \ Mj−1 is contained in an annulus where κ has no zeroes.

is complete.

1 + ef 2

If the approximation of each function gj−1 by gj on Mj−1 in (i) is close enough for all
j ∈ N, then the sequence {gj}j∈N converges uniformly on compacts in N to an I-invariant
holomorphic map ef = (ef1,ef2) : N → C2 satisfying the conclusion of the theorem. Indeed,
2 = h; (iii) gives that Rγ ef θ = q(γ) for every closed curve
(ii) ensures that ef 2
γ ⊂ N ; (iv) guarantees that the zero locus of ef on N is exactly the one of f on S, hence
(|ef1|2 + |ef2|2 + κ)|θ|2 is a Riemannian metric on N with isolated singularities exactly at
the zeroes of |f1|2 + |f2|2 + κ in S; and (v) implies that the metric (|ef1|2 + |ef2|2 + κ)|θ|2
As a corollary of Theorem 6.3, we obtain complete non-orientable minimal surfaces in
Rn with arbitrary conformal structure and n − 2 prescribed coordinate functions. We prove
the following more precise version of Theorem 1.6 (ii).

j ∈ OI(N ) and observe that,
since f assumes values in the null quadric A∗ ⊂ Cn, f 2

We ﬁnish this subsection by proving a more precise version of Theorem 1.6 (iii); see
Corollary 6.5 below. We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition and some basics about the generalized
Gauss map of conformal minimal surfaces in Rn.

Let n ≥ 3 and denote by π : Cn → CPn−1 the canonical projection. A set of hyperplanes
in CPn−1 is said to be in general position if each subset of k hyperplanes, with k ≤ n − 1,
has an (n − 1 − k)-dimensional intersection. Let N be an open Riemann surface. A map
N → CPn−1 is said to be degenerate if its image lies in a proper projective subspace of
CPn−1, and nondegenerate otherwise. Given a holomorphic 1-form θ without zeros on N
and a conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn, n ≥ 3, the map
(6.1)

2∂X

G := π ◦

: N → CPn−1

70

is called the generalized Gauss map of X. Recall (cf. (2.17)) that this is a Kodaira type map
given in homogeneous coordinates on CPn−1 by the expression

G(p) = [∂X1(p) : ∂X2(p) : ··· : ∂Xn(p)],

p ∈ N .

Obviously, G assumes values in the projection in CPn−1 of the null quadric A∗ ⊂ Cn.
Chern and Osserman showed that if X is complete then either X(N ) is a plane or G(N )
intersects a dense set of complex hyperplanes (see [26, 27]). Later, Ru proved that if X
is complete and nonﬂat then G cannot omit more than n(n + 1)/2 hyperplanes in general
position in CPn−1 (see [81] and also Fujimoto [46, 48] for more information). Moreover,
if G is nondegenerate then this upper bound is sharp for some values of n; for instance for
arbitrary odd n and also for any even n ≤ 16 (see [47]). However, the number of exceptional
hyperplanes strongly depends on the underlying conformal structure of the surface. For
example, Ahlfors [3] proved that every holomorphic map C → CPn−1 avoiding n + 1
hyperplanes of CPn−1 in general position is degenerate; see also [86, Chapter 5, §5] and
[45] for further generalizations. The bound n + 1 is sharp since every open Riemann surface
N admits a complete conformal minimal immersion N → Rn whose generalized Gauss
map (6.1) is nondegenerate and omits n hyperplanes in general position (see [8, Theorem
C]). This is natural in light of the following recent result of Hanysz [55, Theorem 3.1]: Let
H1, . . . , HN be distinct hyperplanes in CPn−1; then CPn−1 \SN
j=1 Hj is an Oka manifold
(see [39]) if and only if Hj are in general position and N ≤ n. On the other hand, the
complement of 2n − 1 hyperplanes in general position in CPn−1 is Kobayashi hyperbolic
by the classical result of Green [51] from 1977. This implies that any conformal minimal
surface in Rn parametrized by C or C∗ whose Gauss map omits 2n − 1 hyperplanes in
general position is ﬂat, i.e., its Gauss map is constant.

This natural question remained open in the non-orientable case: do there exist complete
non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn with arbitrary conformal structure whose generalized
Gauss map is nondegenerate and omits n hyperplanes in general position? The following
result gives an afﬁrmative answer to this problem.
Corollary 6.5. Let (N , I) be an open Riemann surface with an antiholomorphic involution
without ﬁxed points, let n ≥ 3, and let p : H1(N ; Z) → Rn be a group homomorphism
such that p ◦ I∗ = −p. Then there exists a full, non-decomposable, I-invariant complete
conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn with FluxX = p whose generalized Gauss
map is nondegenerate and avoids n hyperplanes of CPn−1 in general position.

to suitable rectangular coordinates X = (Xj)n

Recall that a conformal minimal immersion X : N → Rn is said to be decomposable
j=1 in Rn, one has
Pm
k=1(∂Xk)2 = 0 for some m < n, and non-decomposable otherwise. Also, X is said
to be full if X(N ) is not contained in any hyperplane of Rn. When n = 3, the conditions
of being non-decomposable, full, and having nondegenerate generalized Gauss map are
equivalent. On the other hand, if n > 3 then no two of these conditions are equivalent (see
[79]).

One may for instance deﬁne fi on D to be of the form(cid:0) 1

is any holomorphic function D → C \ {0}; this guarantees (b). Further, a suitable choice
of the numbers λi satisfying (a) and of the functions gi trivially ensures condition (c) by

j=1. Let κ : N → R+ be the
I-invariant constant function κ = |λ1| > 0. By (b), Theorem 6.3 ensures that the map

for every closed curve γ ⊂ N , and (|efi,1|2 + |efi,2|2 + κ)|θ|2 is a complete Riemannian

ef := (efi)n/2
i=1 : N → Cn assumes values in A∗ \ {0} and ℜ(ef θ) integrates to an I-invariant
conformal minimal immersion X = (Xj)n
j=1 : N → Rn with FluxX = p. Furthermore, if
the approximation of each fi by efi on S is close enough then (c) implies that X is full and

6.3. Complete non-orientable minimal surfaces with Jordan boundaries. In this
subsection, we provide the ﬁrst known examples of complete non-orientable minimal
surfaces in Rn with Jordan boundaries.

Recall that, given a compact bordered Riemann surface N with a ﬁxed-point-free
antiholomorphic involution I, CMIn
I (N ) denotes the set of I-invariant conformal minimal
immersions N → Rn of class C 1(N ) (see (2.24)). Given X ∈ CMIn
I (N ) we denote
by distX the distance induced on N by the Euclidean metric of Rn via the immersion X.
Recall also that N = N /I and X : N → Rn the induced immersion satisfying X ◦ π = X,
where π : N → N is the canonical projection.

We prove the following more precise version of Theorem 1.5.

Theorem 6.6. Let (N , I) be a compact bordered Riemann surface with boundary bN 6= ∅
and an antiholomorphic involution without ﬁxed points, and let n ≥ 3. Every X ∈
CMIn
I (N ) can be approximated arbitrarily closely in the C 0(N )-topology by I-invariant
continuous maps Y : N → Rn such that Y | ˚N : ˚N → Rn is a complete conformal minimal
immersion, FluxY = FluxX, and Y |bN : bN → Rn is a topological embedding.
In
particular, the boundary Y (bN ) consists of ﬁnitely many Jordan curves in Rn. If n ≥ 5
then the map Y : N → Rn can be chosen a topological embedding.

The key tool in the proof of Theorem 6.6 is the Riemann-Hilbert method, given
by Theorem 3.22, which allows one to perturb a given I-invariant conformal minimal
immersion N → Rn near the boundary, having enough control on its placement in Rn
to keep it suitably bounded. This enables us to avoid the typical shrinking of N in every

previous construction of complete bounded minimal surfaces in Rn (see the seminal paper
by Nadirashvili [78], as well as [16, 11] and the references therein for a history of the Calabi-
Yau problem), and hence work with a ﬁxed conformal structure. See also the discussion in
Subsec. 1.4.

The following technical lemma is crucial in the proof of Theorem 6.6.

Lemma 6.7. Let (N , I), n, and X be as in Theorem 6.6, and let p0 ∈ ˚N . Given a number
λ > 0, we may approximate X arbitrarily closely in the C 0(N )-topology by conformal
minimal immersions Y ∈ CMIn
I (N ) such that FluxY = FluxX and distY (p0, bN ) > λ.
Sketch of proof of Lemma 6.7. We choose ǫ > 0, take numbers d0 and δ0 such that 0 <
d0 < distX (p0, bN ) and 0 < δ0 < ǫ, and set c = 1
0) > 0. Thus, the sequences

I (N ) satisfying the following conditions:

The proof consists of constructing a sequence of I-invariant conformal minimal immersions
Xj ∈ CMIn
(aj) kXj − Xk0,bN < δj.
(bj) distXj (p0, bN ) > dj.
(cj) FluxXj = FluxX.

By the Maximum Principle for harmonic maps, the immersion Y := Xj for sufﬁciently
large j ∈ N satisﬁes the conclusion of the lemma.

A sequence with these properties is constructed recursively. The basis of the induction
is X0 := X, whereas the inductive step can be guaranteed by adapting the proof of [6,
Lemma 4.2] to the non-orientable framework, using Theorems 4.4 and 3.22 (the Mergelyan
theorem and the Riemann-Hilbert method for I-invariant conformal minimal immersions in
Rn) instead of [13, Theorem 5.3] and [6, Theorem 3.6] (their analogues in the orientable
framework). In this case, we split the boundary components α1, I(α1), . . . , αk, I(αk) into
compact connected subarcs such that the splittings of αi and I(αi) are compatible with
respect to the involution I (cf. [6, Equation (4.5)]).
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 6.6. Set X0 := X and ﬁx a point p0 ∈ ˚N . By using Lemma 6.7 we may
construct a sequence of conformal minimal immersions Xj ∈ CMIn
I (N ), j ∈ N, satisfying
the following properties:
(a) Xj approximates Xj−1 as close as desired in the C 0(N )-topology.
(b) distXj (p0, bN ) > j.

(c) FluxXj = FluxX.

Further, by Theorem 1.4 we may also ensure that
(d) X j|bN : bN → Rn is a topological embedding, and X j : N → Rn is a topological

embedding if n ≥ 5.

If all approximations in (a) are close enough then the sequence {Xj}j∈N converges to an
I-invariant continuous map Y : N → Rn satisfying the conclusion of the theorem. See [6,
proof of Theorem 4.5] for details.

6.4. Proper non-orientable minimal surfaces in p-convex domains. In this subsection,
we give several existence and approximation results for complete proper non-orientable
minimal surfaces in (n− 2)-convex domains in Rn, n > 3, or in minimally convex domains
in R3. (See Subsec. 1.5 for the deﬁnition of a p-convex domain in Rn, p ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.)
These results contribute to the major problem of minimal surface theory of determining
which domains in R3 admit complete properly immersed minimal surfaces, and how the
geometry of the domain inﬂuences their conformal properties. For background on this
topic, see e.g. Meeks and P´erez [74, Section 3] and the introduction to [5].

The paper [5] contains general existence and approximation results for proper complete
minimal surfaces in minimally convex (i.e. 2-convex domains) of R3 and (n − 2)-convex
domains of Rn for n ≥ 4; for the case of convex domains see also [6] and references therein.
We now provide analogous results for non-orientable minimal surfaces.
In particular,
we may prove the following summarizing theorem which includes Theorem 1.7 in the
introduction as a corollary.
Theorem 6.8. Let n ≥ 3, set

p = p(n) :=(cid:26) 2

if n = 3,
n − 2 if n ≥ 4,

and let (N , I) be a compact bordered Riemann surface with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomor-
phic involution. The following assertions hold.
(i) If D is a p-convex domain in Rn then every immersion X ∈ CMIn

I (N ) can be
approximated, uniformly on compacts in ˚N = N\bN , by proper complete I-invariant
conformal minimal immersions Y : ˚N → D with FluxY = FluxX. Furthermore, if D
is relatively compact, smoothly bounded and strongly p-convex, then Y can be chosen
to admit a continuous extension to N satisfying Y (bN ) ⊂ bD and the estimate

sup

z∈N kY (z) − X(z)k ≤ Cqmax

z∈bN

distRn(X(z), bD)

for some constant C > 0 depending only on the domain D.

(ii) If Ω ⊂ D are open sets in Rn and ρ : Ω → (0, +∞) is a smooth strongly p-
plurisubharmonic function such that for any pair of numbers 0 < c1 < c2 the set
Ωc1,c2 := {x ∈ Ω : c1 ≤ ρ(x) ≤ c2} is compact, then every X ∈ CMIn
I (N ) satisfying

New complex analytic methods in the study of non-orientable minimal surfaces in Rn

75

X(bN ) ⊂ Ω can be approximated, uniformly on compacts in ˚N , by complete I-
invariant conformal minimal immersions Y : ˚N → D such that FluxY = FluxX ,
Y (z) ∈ Ω for every z ∈ ˚N sufﬁciently close to bN , and

lim
z∈bN

ρ(Y (z)) = +∞.

(iii) If D ⊂ Rn is a domain having a C 2 strongly p-convex boundary point, then there
exist proper complete, I-invariant conformal minimal immersions ˚N → D extending
continuously up to bN .
(iv) If D ⊂ Rn is a domain having a p-convex end in the sense of (ii), or a strongly p-
convex boundary point, then every open non-orientable smooth surface S carries a
complete proper minimal immersion Y : S → D with arbitrary ﬂux.

Moreover, if n ≥ 5 then the immersions Y in (i)–(iv) can be chosen such that the induced
map Y : N → Rn is an embedding.

The most general known results in this line up to now are due to Ferrer-Mart´ın-Meeks
[37] and Alarc´on-L´opez [19, Theorem 1.2], where the conclusion of assertion (iv) is proved
for convex (i.e., 1-convex) domains in R3. In particular, Theorem 6.8 furnishes the ﬁrst
known examples of complete proper non-orientable minimal surfaces in a general p-convex
domain of Rn for n = 3 and p = 2, and for any n > 3 and 1 < p ≤ n − 2. Recall for
instance that the complement of a properly embedded minimal surface in R3 is a minimally
convex domain (see [5, Corollary 1.3]), and hence our results in Theorem 6.8 apply to
this class of domains. These are also the ﬁrst examples of complete proper non-orientable
minimal surfaces in convex domains in Rn, for any n ≥ 3, with control on the underlying
conformal structure.

As usual, we construct the immersions in Theorem 6.8 by a recursive procedure. A main

ingredient for the inductive steps is given by the following lemma.
Lemma 6.9. Let n and p be as in Theorem 6.8, let D be a domain in Rn, and let ρ : D → R
be a C 2 strongly p-plurisubharmonic function with the critical locus P . Given a compact
set L ⊂ D \ P , there exist constants ǫ0 > 0 and C0 > 0 such that the following holds.

Let (N , I) be a compact bordered Riemann surface with a ﬁxed-point-free antiholomor-
phic involution and let X : N → D be an I-invariant conformal minimal immersion of
class C 1(N ). Given an I-invariant continuous function ǫ : bN → [0, ǫ0] supported on the
set J = {ζ ∈ bN : X(ζ) ∈ L}, an open set U ⊂ N containing supp(ǫ) in its relative
interior, and a constant δ > 0, there exists an I-invariant conformal minimal immersion
Y : N → D satisfying the following conditions:
(i) |ρ(Y (ζ)) − ρ(X(ζ)) − ǫ(ζ)| < δ for every ζ ∈ bN .
(ii) ρ(Y (ζ)) ≥ ρ(X(ζ)) − δ for every ζ ∈ N .
(iii) kY − Xk1,N \U < δ.
(iv) kY − Xk0,M ≤ C0√ǫ0.

(v) FluxY = FluxX .

The proof of Lemma 6.9 follows the lines of [5, proof of Proposition 3.3], but
symmetrizing the construction with respect to the involution I and using Theorem 3.22
instead of [5, Theorem 3.2] (the Riemann-Hilbert problem for conformal minimal surfaces
in R3). In particular, all the sets and maps involved in the proof must be taken to be I-
invariant. The key of the proof is that for every z ∈ bN there exists a conformal minimal
disk αX(z) = αX(I(z)) : D → Rn, depending smoothly on z, such that αX(z)(0) = X(z),
ρ(αX(z)(ξ)) ≥ ρ(X(z)) for all ξ ∈ D, and ρ(αX(z)(ξ)) is suitably larger than ρ(X(z))
for |ξ| = 1 (see [5, proof of Proposition 3.3] for more details). The existence of such disks
when n = 3 is guaranteed by [5, Lemma 3.1], whereas for n > 3 one can simply take planar
disks in parallel planes (recall that for n > 3 we have p = n − 2 and see [5, Remark 3.8]).
Using such disks as boundary disks of suitable Riemann-Hilbert problems in a recursive
procedure and applying Theorem 3.22 yields the result. We refer to [5, proof of Proposition
3.3] for further details.

Combining Lemma 6.7, Lemma 6.9, and [5, Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6] (the latter ones enable
one to avoid the critical points of a Morse exhaustion function ρ : D → R when applying
Lemma 6.9), we may prove the following result which provides a recursive step in the proof
of Theorem 6.8.
Lemma 6.10. Let (N , I) be as in Theorem 6.8, let D ⊂ Rn (n ≥ 3) be a domain, let ρ
be a strongly p-plurisubharmonic function on D, and let a < b be real numbers such that
the set Da,b = {x ∈ D : a < ρ(x) < b} is relatively compact in D. Given numbers
0 < η < b − a and δ > 0, an I-invariant conformal minimal immersion X : N → D such
that X(bN ) ⊂ Da,b, a point p0 ∈ ˚N , a number d > 0, and a compact set K ⊂ ˚N , X
may be approximated in the C 1(K)-topology by I-invariant conformal minimal immersions
Y : N → D satisfying the following conditions:

• Y (bN ) ⊂ Db−η,b.
• ρ(Y (ζ)) ≥ ρ(X(ζ)) − δ for every ζ ∈ N .
• distY (p0, bN ) > d.
• FluxY = FluxX .
The proof of Lemma 6.10 follows word by word the one of [5, Lemma 3.7], so we omit

it.

With Lemmas 6.9 and 6.10 in hand, one may prove Theorem 6.8 by following the
arguments in [5, proof of Theorems 1.1, 1.7, and 1.9], but using Theorem 3.22 instead of [5,
Theorem 3.2], Lemma 6.7 instead of [6, Lemma 4.1], Lemma 6.9 instead of [5, Proposition
3.3], and also Theorem 5.1 in order to guarantee the embeddednes of Y if n ≥ 5.

For instance, the proof of Theorem 6.8 (i) roughly goes as follows. We set X0 := X,
choose a strongly p-plurisubharmonic Morse exhaustion function ρ : D → R, pick suitable
increasing sequences a1 < a2 < a3 ··· and d1 < d2 < d3 ··· such that supN ρ ◦ X0 < a1,

limj→∞ aj = +∞, and limj→∞ dj = +∞, and take a decreasing sequence δj > 0 with
δ = P∞
j=1 δj < ∞. We then ﬁx a point p0 ∈ ˚N , and use the cited results to construct
a sequence of smooth I-invariant conformal minimal immersions Xj : N → D and an
increasing sequence of I-invariant compacts K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ S∞
j=1 Kj = ˚N with
p0 ∈ ˚K0, such that the following conditions hold for every j = 1, 2, . . .:
(i) aj < ρ ◦ Xj < aj+1 on N \ Kj.
(ii) ρ ◦ Xj > ρ ◦ Xj−1 − δj on N .
(iii) Xj is close to Xj−1 in the C 1(Kj−1)-topology.
(iv) distXj (p0,N \ Kj) > dj.
(v) FluxXj = FluxXj−1.
If D is is relatively compact, smoothly bounded, and strongly p-convex then we may also
ensure that

(vi) kXj − Xj−1k0,N ≤ C0√2

−jp|a0| for some constant C0 > 0 which does not depend
If the all the approximations in (iii) are close enough then the sequence Xj converges to
an I-invariant conformal minimal immersion Y : ˚N → D satisfying the conclusion of the
theorem.

The proofs of Theorem 6.8 (ii), (iii), and (iv) follow similar basic patterns. We again refer

to [5, Proof of Theorems 1.1, 1.7, and 1.9] and leave the details to the interested reader.
