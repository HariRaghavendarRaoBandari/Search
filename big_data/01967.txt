A Bose-Einstein condensate is used as an atomic source for a high precision sensor. A 5×106 atom
F=1 spinor condensate of 87Rb is released into free fall for up to 750 ms and probed with a Mach-
Zehnder atom interferometer based on Bragg transitions. The Bragg interferometer simultaneously
addresses the three magnetic states, |mf = 1, 0,−1(cid:105), facilitating a simultaneous measurement of the
acceleration due to gravity with an asymptotic precision of 2.1 × 10−9 ∆g/g and the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient to a precision 8 pT/m.

Acquiring accurate and precise data on magnetic and
gravity ﬁelds is critical to progress in mineral discovery
[1, 2], navigation [3] and climate science [4]. A diverse
array of tools and techniques have been developed to im-
prove the quality of measurements, ranging from macro-
scopic classical springs [5] and falling corner cubes [6],
through to solid-state [7] and superconducting [8] sys-
tems. Over the past decade devices using cold atom
sources have become competitive with traditional sen-
sors [9]. Technical developments improving size, weight
and power have allowed for applications in space science
[10] and ﬁeld ready state-of-the-art gravimeters and gra-
diometers [11–13].

Like their classical counterparts, sensors based on cold
atoms measure the trajectory of the test particles [14].
Unlike classical particles, atoms oﬀer internal degrees of
freedom, allowing for the possibility of additional simul-
taneous measurements including time, magnetic ﬁelds
and magnetic ﬁeld gradients. Although these advan-
tages are intrinsic to all atomic sources, ultra-cold Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC) sources oﬀer additional ben-
eﬁts over thermal atoms. An intrinsic feature of a BEC
is a spatial coherence equivalent to the size of the cloud
which is generally 100’s of µm while thermal sources have
spatial coherence length on the order of the de Broglie
wavelength, λdB =
tial coherence has been previously shown to provide ro-
bustness to technical noise sources, much like the laser
provides for optical measurements [16].

This letter introduces a new type of sensor which si-
multaneously measures gravity and magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ents to high precision. In this lab based sensor, an opti-
cally trapped cloud of 87Rb atoms is cooled to conden-
sation and projected into an F = 1 spin superposition,
then passed through a vertical light pulse Mach-Zehnder
interferometer based on Bragg transitions [17, 18]. The
spin superposition in combination with the large spatial
coherence of the BEC allows for a simultaneous preci-
sion measurement of gravity and absolute magnetic ﬁeld
gradient[19]. The full condensate of 2 × 106 atoms is

used in the interferometer [20] and the interferometric
contrast is found to be constant over the full range of
sensor operation.

The experimental schematic can be seen in Figure 1.
A hot sample of 87Rb atoms is created and precooled in a
2D magneto-optical trap (MOT). These precooled atoms
are then transferred to an aluminum ultra-high vacuum
cell via a high impedance line and blue detuned push
beam. In 6 s 5 × 109 atoms are collected in a 3D MOT
where a standard compression and polarization gradient
cooling sequence is applied giving a ﬁnal temperature of
20 µK. The atoms are then loaded into a hybrid mag-
netic quadropole and crossed optical dipole trap. Here
an initial stage of evaporation is completed using a mi-
crowave knife over 4.5 s leaving 4×107 atoms at 4 µK and
a phase space density of 1 × 10−4. The magnetic ﬁeld
gradient is decreased from an initial value of 150 G/cm
to 25 G/cm over 200 ms where the atoms are no longer
supported against gravity. This eﬃciently loads all the
atoms into a crossed dipole trap. The magnetic ﬁeld is
subsequently reduced to zero and extinguished over the
remainder of the experiment. A pair of 1070 nm broad
linewidth ﬁber lasers intersecting at 22.5◦ each with beam
waists of 300 µm provide the optical trap volume. Forced
evaporation is then completed by simultaneously reduc-
ing the intensity of both optical beams. After 2 s of evap-
oration a pure |F = 1, mf = −1(cid:105) 2×106 atom condensate
is formed with an in trap width of approximately 50 µm.
The eﬀective thermal temperature of the condensate is
estimated to be signiﬁcantly below 50 nK for the expan-
sion times tested (up to 750 ms). Controlling the ﬁnal
trap depth allows for the creation of a pure BEC or ultra-
cold thermal source. Following production of the conden-
sate, the optical trap is extinguished suddenly (∼10 µs)
and the atoms fall under gravity. The apparatus allows
for a 750 ms time-of-ﬂight (TOF) with four regions avail-
able for horizontal imaging at 0 − 25 ms, 220 ms, 530 ms,
and 750 ms. Standard absorption imaging techniques are
used for the 0 − 25 ms and 220 ms imaging regions. Fre-
quency modulation imaging (FMI) [21] is implemented

2

beams are aligned through mutual ﬁber coupling ensur-
ing negligible relative angle. A vertically oriented Mach-
Zehnder atom interferometer consisting of three 30 GHz
detuned Bragg pulses (which ensure orthogonal internal
mf states) is then utilized to measure the phase accu-
mulated on all three internal states as they fall. The
Bragg lattice is generated by two frequency shifted beams
with orthogonal linear polarizations. These beams are
coupled to the apparatus head in a single polarization-
maintaining single-mode ﬁber and then passed through a
quarter waveplate (λ/4) before and after the atoms. This
is followed by the inertial reference retro reﬂector. The
orientation of Bragg optics is such that the Bragg transi-
tions are driven by circularly polarized light. One beam is
frequency chirped to match the increasing doppler shift
of the atoms as they fall, while the other is adjusted
to address the resonance frequency for transfer of 2 ¯hk
of momentum, where k is the wavenumber of the light.
The Bragg laser is aligned to vertical using a liquid mer-
cury mirror and back coupled into the output ﬁber over
a 6 m total path length. A home built external cavity
diode laser seeds a frequency doubled 1560 nm ﬁber laser
system capable of producing 11 W of 780 nm light with
a linewidth of 5 kHz to generate the Bragg and Raman
light [22]. Independent frequency control and pulse shap-
ing for all Bragg and Raman beams is accomplished us-
ing four acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) driven with
a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) and referenced to a
Cesium primary frequency standard. No active optical
phase locking system has been implemented in the cur-
rent setup.

A 5 cm gold mirror mounted on a home built geometric
anti-spring (GAS) [23] gives the inertial reference for the
systems. The GAS provides passive ﬁltering of ground
vibrations by virtue of a low frequency mechanical oscil-
lator. This passive oscillator can be tuned to an ultra-
low natural frequency of 70 mHz but is typically run
at 180 mHz thus giving signiﬁcant isolation from 1 Hz
(< −11 dB) and greater (< −38 dB at 70 Hz).
The various experimental cycles and data acquisition
are as follows. A BEC of 2 × 106 atoms is created and
released into free fall. 5 ms after release the atoms are
either left in the initial mf state or transferred into a su-
perposition of 25 % |mf = −1(cid:105), 50 % |mf = 0(cid:105), and 25
% |mf = 1(cid:105), Figure 2(C). The time between cloud release
and the start of the interferometer, T0, is varied from 7 to
100 ms to investigate the eﬀect of undissipated mean ﬁeld
energy on the phase noise of the interferometer, Figure
3. It is seen that the phase noise in the interferometer
correlated to cloud density variations due to imperfect
beam splitter pulses asymptotes at T0 ≈ 20 ms. This
behavior has good agreement with a simple mean ﬁeld
model of energy [17] and corresponds to ∼ 1 mrad ad-
ditional phase noise at T0 ≈ 20 ms. Due to this eﬀect
30 ms of free expansion is allowed for all high sensitivity
interferometers.

sitivity interferometers.

5 ms after the atoms are released from the optical trap,
a pair of far detuned, co-propagating, mutually linear po-
larized beams are pulsed on to induce Raman transitions.
These transfer the condensate into a magnetic superposi-
tion state of |mf = 1, 0,−1(cid:105), Figure 2(A-E). The Raman

FIG. 4: The contrast of a |mf = −1(cid:105) BEC interferometer for
varying T . Contrast is deﬁned here as the diﬀerence between
the maximum and minimum of an interference fringe.

Following free expansion a sequence of Gaussian
shaped Bragg pulses of 50 µs width are applied to form
a Mach-Zehder interferometer. By scanning the phase of
the ﬁnal beam splitter an interference fringe like that in
Figure 2(G) can be produced. The time in between in-
terferometer pulses, T , may be varied from 1 to 250 ms.
By scanning T in a magnetically sensitive interferometer
the fringe contrast is explored in regions of varying cloud
separation at the ﬁnal beam splitter, Figure 4. The cur-
vature of the magnetic ﬁeld along the 2.5 m drop leads
to unequal accelerations felt by each interferometer arm.
This asymmetric acceleration will result in a ﬁnal posi-
tional separation of the two arms at the ﬁnal beam split-
ter pulse. The total separation is then proportional to T 2.
A BEC source is shown to maintain contrast (≈ 80 %)
over the full interferometer range which suggests that
the coherence length of a BEC ensures robustness to sys-
tematics leading to mismatch at the ﬁnal beam split-
ter. In comparison a thermal cloud (velocity selected to
90 nK) undergoing the same experimental sequence ex-
hibits only 7 % contrast at T = 40 ms. Following the
ﬁnal beam splitter pulse a variable amplitude magnetic
ﬁeld gradient from a vertical co-axial solenoid can be ap-
plied to impart Stern-Gerlach separation of the diﬀerent
magnetic states as seen in Figure 2. Due to the limited
2 ¯hk momentum separation of the interferometer arms,
200 ms of free propagation is needed for suﬃcient sepa-
ration of the ﬁnal momentum states. Implementation of
large momentum transfer beamsplitters would alleviate
the need for this long separation time [24]. Finally, the
number of atoms in each momentum and internal state is
measured using FMI. The total phase shift accumulated
in each interferometer is given by φtotal = φg + φB where
φg and φB are given by:

times, T0, before a T = 60 ms Mach-Zehnder interferometer
is performed. The eﬃciency of the ﬁrst beam splitter pulse is
varied by up to 15 % ensuring diﬀerent atom numbers in each
arm. This number imbalance will lead to a relative phase shift
on the arms due to mean ﬁeld interactions. By performing
many runs the phase noise from this number imbalance and
initial cloud density can be found. The phase noise from
mean ﬁeld eﬀects in this system asymptote at 20 ms to the
background phase noise from the Bragg laser system. A basic
mean ﬁeld model of the system is plotted against this data
with good agreement.

the art relative devices such as solid state (0.52 nT/m,
1 second integration) [25] and SQUID based systems
( 10 pT/m, 1 second integration) [26]. A more sophisti-
cated analysis of the sensor noise is likely to achieve sig-
niﬁcantly higher precision through common mode noise
reduction. At current precision this sensor is capable of
recognizing weak magnetic features such as paramagnetic
rock anomalies at depths of 1 km [7]. This step change
in sensor technology enabled by fundamental properties
in source selection will allow for the simultaneous preci-
sion exploration of gravitational and magnetic anomalies
leading to higher spatial resolution mapping as well as
the ability to diﬀerentiate the feature’s material proper-
ties.

In conclusion, a high precision simultaneous gravime-
ter, magnetic gradiometer, and magnetometer based on
a free falling Bose-condensed source has been demon-
strated. The atomic source provides internal degrees of
freedom allowing the preparation of magnetically sen-
sitive states. Due to the large and spatially varying
background magnetic ﬁeld of the surrounding environ-
ment the simultaneous measurement of all states (mag-
netic and non-magnetic) would not be possible without
the macroscopic spatial coherence provided by the con-
densed source. The ﬂexibility of this device allowed for
direct mean-ﬁeld noise characterization of a BEC in a
high precision apparatus. Furthermore a direct compar-
ison of diﬀerent sources (thermal or BEC) was achieved
showing that under near identical systematic conditions
a condensate has contrast a factor of 5 higher than the
thermal cloud. A full noise characterization of the system
will be investigated in the future. This is the ﬁrst itera-
tion towards an all-in-one quantum sensor which will be
capable of simultaneous measurement of g, ∆g, B, ∆B,
rotations, and time). Currently work is ongoing to im-
plement symmetric horizontal Bragg transitions to also
measure rotations.

for condensed sources to become viable in ﬁeld deploy-

is applied using Bragg transitions and three simultaneous
(|mf = −1, 0, 1(cid:105)) interferometer fringes are plotted by scan-
ning the phase of the ﬁnal Bragg pulse. The three states
have a combined statistical phase noise corresponding to
5.69 × 10−8 ∆g/g in a single run and an asymptotic precision
of 2.1 × 10−9 ∆g/g. Changes in local gravity are monitored
through correlated phase shifts of all mf states. The absolute
background ﬁeld, B, and ﬁeld gradients, dB/dz, are found
from the relative phase shifts between all states (∆Φ−1, ∆Φ1,
and ∆Φ−1 + ∆Φ1)using equation 1. Changes in db/dz are
monitored through anti-correlated phase shifts of |mf = −1(cid:105)
and |mf = 1(cid:105) relative to |mf = 0(cid:105).

achieved with T = 130 ms (seen in Figure 5) with a
combined acceleration sensitivity of the three states of
5.69 × 10−8 ∆g/g in a single run and an asymptotic pre-
cision of 2.1 × 10−9 ∆g/g. This sensitivity is limited by
laser phase noise on the passive Bragg laser system. As
seen in equation 1 and Figure 5 the interferometers in
the |mf = −1(cid:105) and |mf = 1(cid:105) states are phase shifted with
opposite signs away from the ﬁrst order magnetically in-
sensitive mf = 0 state. By comparing the relative phase
shifts it is then possible to combine the three fringes to
extract absolute magnetic ﬁeld gradient, absolute mag-
netic ﬁeld, and local gravity. In addition, it is straightfor-
ward to extend the system to measure gravity gradients
[18].

Figure 6 shows the measure of magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent along a portion of the drop. The maximum achieved
phase sensitivity in the current apparatus enables an ab-
solute magnetic ﬁeld gradient sensitivity of 8 pT/m. To
date this is the highest achieved absolute magnetic gra-
dient sensitivity. This is competitive with the state of

(10 s). Signiﬁcant progress towards solving this prob-
lem has been reported and summarized recently [27].
Nonetheless, fast condensate production generally sac-
riﬁces total atom number for duty cycle. This is evident
from the best integrated ﬂux [27] achieved in fast devices,
5 × 104 atoms/s, when compared to the 4 × 105 atoms/s
ﬂux in this device. The application of techniques such as
sideband cooling oﬀer a path to improving ﬂux on both
atom chip and free-space based sensors [28] without sac-
riﬁcing atom number. The possibility for the integration
of sideband cooling techniques with the current sensor
are being explored.
