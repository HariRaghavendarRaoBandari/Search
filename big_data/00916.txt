We analyze diﬀerent families of discrete maps in the N-qubit systems in the context of the permu-
tation invariance. We prove that the tomographic condition imposed on the self-dual (Wigner) map
is incompatible with the requirement of the invariance under particle permutations, which makes it
impossible to project the Wootters-like Wigner function into the space of symmetric measurements.
We also provide several explicit forms of the self-dual mappings: a) tomographic and b) permutation
invariant and analyze the symmetric projection in the latter case.

INTRODUCTION

Phase-space methods [1–3] have been widely applied
in quantum mechanics both for state visualization and
analysis of quantum-classical transitions from kinemat-
ical and dynamic perspectives. According to this ap-
proach quantum states are mapped into distributions on
some manifold, which is associated with a ”classical”
phase-space. The structure of the mapping as well as
their principal characteristics depend on the symmetry of
a given quantum system. The basic requirement for any
meaningful phase-space representation is the covariance
under an appropriate group of transformations (which
is one of the fundamental Stratonovich-Weyl conditions
[4], [5], [6]). In the case of continuous symmetries and
when the operators from the group representation act ir-
reducibly in the Hilbert space of the quantum system,
the phase-space manifold can be constructed as a certain
quotient space and has an intimate relation to the set of
coherent states [7] - [14]. Then, a systematic procedure
for the so-called s-parametrized phase-space mapping can
be suggested at least for some type of dynamic symmetry
groups [6, 13, 15].

The situation is essentially more involved in case of
discrete systems. Although several approaches for rep-
resentation of states of a generic d-dimensional system
in a discrete lattice were considered [16], an explicit self-
consistent map possessing all the required properties can
be constructed only when d = pN , where p is a prime
number [17]. Then, a discrete pN × pN grid, playing
the role of the phase-space MpN , possesses the same ba-
sic geometric properties as an ordinary plane and allows
a direct association of states with speciﬁc geometrical
structures [17], [18] related to the notion of mutually un-
biased bases [19]. A set of dual maps from the Hilbert
space HpN to MpN can be introduced in a similar way as
in the continuous case [20], [21], [22]. It is worth noting,
that in this approach only the ”boundary” maps, corre-
sponding to the familiar P and Q functions [5] - [9], are
uniquely deﬁned. All the other maps still can be ”re-
ﬁned” by imposing additional conditions to the standard

Stratonovich-Weyl requirements. One possible condition
could be the marginal reduction, i.e. that summing the
image of the density matrix in MpN (a quasidistribu-
tion function) along a set of points associated with a
given state one obtains the probability distribution in
this state. This requirement gives a clear geometric in-
terpretation of the discrete map and is also known as a
tomographic condition.

p

Regrettably, none of the discrete phase-space repre-
sentations is eﬃcient for the visualization of states of
large compound (many-particle) quantum systems [23].
It is mainly related to the ordering problem on MpN ,
but is also connected to the classical indistinguishability
between irreducible degenerated subspaces (subspaces of
the same dimensions that appear in the decomposition
of H⊗N
). The use of the so-called projected Q-function
for the analysis of N-qubit systems, d = 2N was re-
cently proposed in [24]. Such a function is deﬁned in a
three-dimensional discrete N ×N ×N space and contains
full and non-redundant information about results of mea-
surements of any invariant under particle permutations
observable in an arbitrary (not necessarily symmetric)
state. Unfortunately, being a positive image of the den-
sity matrix, the projected Q-function is not convenient
for graphical representation of the interference pattern
and it would be desirable to ﬁnd a symmetric map al-
lowing to distinguish between coherent and incoherent
superpositions.

In this paper we analyze the s-parametrized family of
discrete maps for N-qubits systems from the perspective
of projection into the space of symmetric measurements
and discuss several possibilities of constructing discrete
maps according to established invariance properties.

In Sec.II we brieﬂy recall the concept of s-parametrized
discrete mappings. In Sec.III we provide explicit forms
for discrete mappings under diﬀerent symmetry condi-
tions and prove the inconsistency between the tomo-
graphic and permutation-invariance requirements. We
also discuss the projected form of self-dual mappings in-
variant under particle permutations.

with a particular element of the basis: qubiti ⇔ θi. This
DPS (isomorphic to a product of two-dimensional dis-
crete torus T 2⊗T 2⊗...) is endowed with a ﬁnite geometry
[17] and admits a set of discrete symplectic transforma-
tions [20], [21]. Thus, in complete similarity with the
continuous case, the axes of the discrete phase-space are
associated with the complementary observables Zα and
Xβ in the sense that any eigenstate of either one of them
is a state of maximum uncertainty with respect to the
other.

III. SYMMETRIES OF DPS MAPPING

The representation of an N-qubit state ρ in DPS by
any of W (s)
ρ (α, β) has an important drawback: while for
a small number of particles the plot of quasidistributions
is representative, it becomes extremely involved and is
practically useless for analysis of quantum states when
N ≫ 1 [23]. In part it is a consequence of the absence
of a natural ordering of elements of F
In addition,
the central limit theorem is not directly applicable to
the distributions labeled by N-tuples (representations of
2N ) {(a1, ..., aN ) , ai ∈ Z2}. This explains an essentially
F
smaller number (with respect to the continuous case) of
applications of the discrete phase-space representations
in many-body quantum mechanics.

A. Permutation-invariant s = ±1 mapping

Nevertheless, this problem can be ﬁxed if the available
set of measurements is restricted only to symmetric ob-
servables { ˆS}, i.e. invariant under particle permutations,
ˆS = ˆΠij ˆS ˆΠij , , i, j = 1, ...N , where ˆΠij is the permuta-
tion operator [24]. It results that if the ﬁducial state |ξi

in (6) is permutation-invariant (i.e.

it is a spin coher-
ent state), and hξ| D(γ, δ)|ξi 6= 0, the image W (±1)
(α, β)
of any symmetric operator ˆS, is a function only of the
(permutation) invariants constructed on the phase-space
coordinates (α,β)

where {ai + bi} means sum mod 2, and 0 ≤ h (κ) ≤ N .
In other words, W (±1)
(α, β) are permutation-invariant
functions of the phase-space coordinates, where α and β
are considered as N-tuples, α = (a1, ..., aN ), according to
(3).

S

Thus, the full information about the results of mea-
surements of any symmetric observable in an (arbi-
trary) N-qubit state ρ is contained in the projection of
W (±1)
(α, β) into the 3 dimensional space spanned by
h (α), h (β), h(α+β) (space of symmetric measurements),

While the distribution W (1)
(α,β) (corresponding to the
P -function) becomes quite singular for large number of
qubits, W (−1)
(α,β) (the Q-function) tends to a smooth
distribution when N ≫ 1 and is very convenient for anal-
ysis of quantum states in the macroscopic limit [24]. It
is worth noting here that

ρ

∆(−1)(α, β) = |α,βihα,β|,

(13)

where |α, βi = D(α, β)|ξi are the so-called discrete co-
herent states, that form an informational complete set of
POVMs when hξ| D(γ, δ)|ξi 6= 0.

B. Covariant (Wigner) mapping

ρ

Unfortunately, the projection ˜W (−1)

does not distin-
guish very well between coherent and incoherent super-
positions due to the typical (for the Q-function form) of
the mapping kernel (13). For instance, for the GHZ state
|GHZi = ∼ |0...0i + |1...1i = |0i + |1i, where in the last
equation 0, 1 ∈ F

2N one has

˜W (−1)

GHZ (m, n, k) =

(15)
and the interference described by the last term in (14) is
negligible compared with the principal maxima located

at (N, N, N ± N/√3)/2.

In the continuous case it is known that the appropri-
ate representation, that ”sees” the interference pattern
is provided by the Wigner function, deﬁned as a self-
dual image of the density matrix (when the same type
of mapping is used both for the density operator and
for the observables in order to compute average values
by convoluting corresponding symbols). In addition, the
continuous analog of the kernel (6) for s = 0 possesses
another important property:
integration of the Wigner
function along a strip in phase-space gives the marginal
probability associated to the corresponding area.

In the standard construction [17], the straight lines,

β = ξα + ν.

(16)

in DPS can be associated with (appropriately or-
dered [21]) eigenstates of sets of commuting monomials
{XξαZα}.
The discrete self-dual map (4), s = 0, only guarantees
that summing the Wigner function along axes α = 0 and
β = 0 leads to the correct projections on the logical ba-
sis |κi and the dual basis |˜κi respectively, where |˜κi are
eigenstates of Xβ operators. The requirement that sum-
ming along any line (16) gives the marginal probability
distribution for the observable associated with that line,
is an additional condition. This so-called tomographic
condition restricts the possible choices of the phase (8)
of the displacement operator (7). It is worth noting here,
that the kernels ∆(±1)(α, β) do not depend on this phase.
A convenient way for constructing the eigenstates
νi} of a commuting set {XξαZα} associated to the

{|ψξ
line (16) is to use the rotation operator Vξ,

VξZαV †ξ ∼ ZαXξα, [Vξ, Xν] = 0, V0 = I,

so that

|ψξ
νi = VξXν|0i,

(17)

(18)

where |0i is the eigenstate of Zα with positive eignevalues
for all α ∈ F
2N . The rotation operator expanded in the
dual basis |˜κi has the form [21]
cκ,ξ|eκiheκ|,

Vξ = X

c0,ξ = 1.

(19)

κ

where the coeﬃcients cκ,ξ satisfy the following non-linear
recurrence equation

cκ+α,ξc∗κ,ξ = χ(ξακ)cα,ξ,

(20)

so that the unbiasedness condition |hψξ
ν ′i|2 = 2−N ,
ξ 6= ξ′ between the states associated to the lines (16)

ν|ψξ′

with diﬀerent slopes is satisﬁed automatically, and the
rotation of Zα gives VξZαV †ξ = cα,ξZαXαξ. Geometri-
cally, the action of Vξ can be interpreted as rotations of

and the kernel ∆(0)(α, β) acquires the form of the sum of
projectors on the lines crossing at the phase-space point

It is worth not-
ing that Vξ do not form an abelian group and satisfy the
relation V 2

ξ = Xξ2N −1 .

Vξ⇒ β = ξα.

One of the possible family of solutions of (20) is

cα,ξ = (−i)h(αpξp/2) , p = 1, 2, 4, 8..., 2N−1,

(21)

which can be veriﬁed by direct substitution.

The solution with p = 1,

cα,ξ = (−i)h(α√ξ) ,

(22)

where √ξ is the square root of ξ uniquely deﬁned on F
2N ,
possesses an extra symmetry. In this case the rotation of
the horizontal axis to the ray with the slope ξ = 1 (π/4
rotation) is factorized,

V1 = ⊗j X

kj =0,1

(−i)kj |ekjihekj|,

and in addition the transformation

V1ZαV †1 = (−i)h(α) ZαXα,

z

into (−i)h(α) ZαXα = σα1

produces no phase during the conversion of Zα = σα1
z ⊗

It is worth noting that another solution of Eq. (20) is
closely connected to the so-called graph-state formalism
[27] and has the form

In particular, the solution (21) leads to the following

1. Symmetric Wigner mapping

In order to construct a self-contained projection of
W (0)
ρ (α, β) on the space of symmetric measurements sim-
ilar to (12), the map ∆(0)(α, β) should satisfy the basic
condition that the symbol W (0)
S (α, β) of any symmet-
ric operator ˆS is a permutation-invariant function of the

phase-space coordinates. This condition requires invari-
ance of ∆(0)(α, β) under particle permutations,

ˆΠij ∆(0)(α, β) ˆΠij = ∆(0)(α, β),

(31)

and is fulﬁlled only when the phase (8) is an invariant
function under the same permutations of α and β.

Theorem: There does not exist a complete set of
permutation-invariant phases φ (α, β) satisfying the con-
dition (25).

Proof: The relation (25) leads to the following recur-

rence equation for the phase φ (α, β)

φ (α + β, αξ + βξ) = χ(αβξ)φ (α, αξ) φ (β, βξ) .

Let us suppose that φ (x, y) is invariant under a per-
mutation of x and y, then χ(αβξ) = χ((α)(β)(αξ)(βξ))
(here we have used the property tr(α) = tr(α2)) must be
also invariant under the same permutation of α, β, βξ and
αξ. Nevertheless, a permutation of r-th and s-th qubits
does not leave invariant χ(αβξ) when α = θ2
p, β = θp+θq,

p(cid:1) for any
ξ = (θr + θs)−1 such that tr(cid:0)θrθ2
q satisfying q 6= p 6= r 6= s (here θj are elements of a
In fact, taking into account that un-
self-dual basis).
der permutation of r-th and s-th qubits the N-tuple α is
transformed into α′ = α+εtr (αε), ε = θr +θs we observe
that

p(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)θsθ2

χ(cid:16)[α′] [β′](cid:2)αε−1(cid:3)′(cid:2)βε−1(cid:3)′(cid:17) = −χ(cid:0)[α] [β](cid:2)βε−1(cid:3)(cid:2)αε−1(cid:3)(cid:1)

which means that for these values α, β and ξ the phase
χ ([α] [β] [βξ] [αξ]) is not invariant under the permutation
ε.

Thus, one can not project the Wigner map (27) into
the space of symmetric measurements in a manner similar
to (12).

2. Permutation-invariant phase

As we have proved, the tomographic condition is in-
compatible with the permutation invariance of the phase
(8). Nevertheless, withdrawing this requirement and de-
manding only the Hermiticity of the map (9) one can ﬁnd
multiple permutation-invariant solutions of Eq.(10). The
simplest one is an arbitrary distributed (on ± signs) set
of square roots,

(observe that h (α) + h (β) − h (α + β) = 2Pi αi, βi)

where f (α, β) is an arbitrary permutation invariant func-
tion. If the function f (α, β) is in addition factorizable,

where Rmnk is deﬁned in (15) and Cm
N are the Bi-
nomial coeﬃcients. One can observe a large interfer-
ence term centered at (N/2, N/2, N/2) while the max-
ima corresponding to |0i and |1i are located now at
(N/2, 0, N/2) and (N/2, N, N/2) respectively (compare
with (14)). This picture is very similar to the represen-
tation of the interference of Schrodinger cat-like states in
the ﬂat phase-space.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

6

The discrete Wigner map corresponding to (4)-(6) at
s = 0 can be either permutation symmetric or satisfy
the tomographic condition (24). In both cases there ex-
ist multiple constructions of such mappings. Symmetric
maps allow the projection of the Wigner function into the
space of symmetric measurements and detect the inter-
ference patterns, separated from the contribution of the
incoherent terms. Nevertheless, there is no symmetric
projection of the Wootters-like Wigner function deﬁned
by the map (27), which essentially limits the application
of this map for analysis of large N-qubit systems.

During the preparation of this paper we found an ar-
ticle by Huangjun Zhu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 040501
(2016) where the relation of the discrete Wigner function
with permutation symmetry was analyzed in a diﬀerent
context.
