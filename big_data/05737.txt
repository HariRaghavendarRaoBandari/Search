Abstract

Advances in our understanding of perturbation theory suggest the existence of a cor-
respondence between classical general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. A concrete
example of this correspondence, which is known as the double copy, was recently intro-
duced for the case of stationary Kerr-Schild spacetimes. Building on this foundation,
we examine the simple time-dependent case of an accelerating, radiating point source.
The gravitational solution, which generalises the Schwarzschild solution, includes a
non-trivial stress-energy tensor. This stress-energy tensor corresponds to a gauge the-
oretic current in the double copy. We interpret both of these sources as representing
the radiative part of the ﬁeld. Furthermore, in the simple example of Bremsstrahlung,
we determine a scattering amplitude describing the radiation, maintaining the double
copy throughout. Our results provide the strongest evidence yet that the classical
double copy is directly related to the BCJ double copy for scattering amplitudes.

Introduction

Our most reﬁned understanding of nature is founded on two major theoretical frameworks:
general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. There is much in common between these two: local
symmetries play an important role in their structure; there are simple action principles for
both theories; the geometry of ﬁbre bundles is common to the physical interpretation of
the theories. But at the perturbative level, general relativity seems to be a vastly diﬀerent
creature to Yang-Mills theory. Indeed, the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, when expanded in
deviations of the spacetime metric from some ﬁducial metric (such as the Minkowski metric)
contains terms with arbitrarily many powers of the deviations. This is in stark contrast to
the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, which contains at most fourth order terms in perturbation theory.

From this perturbative point of view, it is therefore remarkable that Kawai, Lewellen and Tye
(KLT) found [1] that every tree scattering amplitude in general relativity can be expressed
as a sum over products of two colour-stripped Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes. Therefore
the KLT relations and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian together can be used to reconstruct the
Lagrangian of general relativity [2]. This suggests that there may be a KLT-like map be-
tween solutions of general relativity and solutions of Yang-Mills theory.

More recently, the perturbative relationship between gauge and gravity theories has been for-
mulated in a particularly suggestive manner by Bern, Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ) [3–5].
BCJ found that gravity n-point amplitudes can be obtained from n-point gauge theory coun-
terparts at the level of diagrams. Speciﬁcally, the BCJ prescription is simply to replace the
colour factor of each diagram by an additional copy of the diagram’s kinematic numerator.
This replacement must be performed in a particular representation of the amplitude, where
the kinematic numerators satisfy the algebraic properties of the corresponding colour factor.
In particular, the kinematic factors must satisfy the same Jacobi identities and antisymmetry
properties as the colour factors. For this reason, the BCJ representation of the kinematic
numerators is known as a colour-dual representation. The procedure of replacing colour
factors in gauge theory scattering amplitudes with another copy of the kinematic numerator
is known as the double copy, since it represents gravity scattering amplitudes as two copies
of Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes.

The validity of the BCJ double copy and the existence of colour-dual numerators has been
proven at tree-level [5–13] (where it is equivalent to the KLT relations [1]). One very ex-
citing feature of the BCJ procedure is that it admits a simple extension to loop diagrams
in the quantum theory [4]. This extension remains conjectural, but it has been veriﬁed in
highly nontrivial examples at multiloop level [4, 14–35]. All-order evidence can be obtained
in special kinematic regimes [17, 36–39], but a full proof of the correspondence has to date
been missing (see, however, refs. [40–54] for related studies).

Motivated by this progress, a double copy for classical ﬁeld solutions (which we will refer to
as the classical double copy) has been proposed [55]. This classical double copy is similar

2

in structure to the BCJ double copy for scattering amplitudes:
in both cases, the tensor
structure of gravity is constructed from two copies of the vector structure of gauge theory.
In addition, scalar propagators are present in both cases; these scalars are exactly the same
in gauge and gravitational processes. However, the classical double copy [55] is only un-
derstood at present for the special class of Kerr-Schild solutions in general relativity. This
reﬂects the particularly simple structure of Kerr-Schild metrics: the Kerr-Schild ansatz has
the remarkable property that the Einstein equations exactly linearise. Therefore we can an-
ticipate that any Yang-Mills solution related to a Kerr-Schild spacetime must be particularly
simple. Indeed, the authors of [55] showed that any stationary Kerr-Schild solution has a
well-deﬁned single copy that satisﬁes the Yang-Mills equations, which also take the linearised
form. While the structure of the classical double copy is very reminiscent of the BCJ double
copy, so far no precise link has been made between the two. One aim of the present article
is to provide such a link.

Although the classical double copy is only understood for a restricted class of solutions, many
of these are familiar. For example, the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are members of
this class; in higher dimensions, the Myers-Perry black holes are included [55]. The rela-
tionship between classical solutions holds for all stationary Kerr-Schild solutions, but other
Kerr-Schild solutions are known to have appropriate single copies. A particularly striking ex-
ample is the shockwave in gravity and gauge theory; the double copy of this pair of solutions
was pointed out by Saotome and Akhoury [36]. In further work, the classical double copy
has been extended [56] to the Taub-NUT solution [57, 58], which has a double Kerr-Schild
form and whose single copy is a dyon in gauge theory.

Despite this success, Kerr-Schild solutions are very special and do not easily describe physi-
cal systems which seem very natural from the point of view of the double copy for scattering
amplitudes. For example, there is no two-form ﬁeld or dilaton on the gravity side; there
are no non-abelian features on the gauge theory side; the status of the sources must be
better understood. In cases where the sources are point particle-like, the classical double
copy relates the gauge theory current density to the gravity energy-momentum tensor in
a natural way [55, 56]. For extended sources, extra pressure terms on the gravity side are
needed to stabilise the matter distribution. Furthermore, reference [59] pointed out that
in certain gravity solutions the energy-momentum tensor does not satisfy the weak and/or
strong energy conditions of general relativity.

The aim of this paper is to extend the classical double copy of refs. [55,56] by considering one
of the simplest situations involving explicit time dependence, namely that of an arbitrarily
accelerating, radiating point source. We will see that this situation can indeed be interpreted
in the Kerr-Schild language, subject to the introduction of additional source terms for which
we provide a clear interpretation. One important fact which will emerge is that these sources
themselves have a double copy structure. We will demonstrate that the sources can be related
directly to scattering amplitudes, maintaining the double copy throughout. This provides a

3

direct link between the classical double copy and the BCJ procedure for amplitudes, strongly
bolstering the argument that these double copies are the same. The gravitational solution
of interest to us is a time-dependent generalisation of the Schwarzschild solution; we will
see that this gravitational system is a precise double copy of an accelerating point particle.
Since there is a double copy of the sources, and these describe the radiation ﬁelds, we learn
that the gravitational radiation emitted by a black hole which undergoes a short period of
acceleration is a precise double copy of electromagnetic Bremsstrahlung.

The structure of our paper is as follows. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the Kerr-Schild double
copy. In section 3, we present a known Kerr-Schild solution for an accelerating particle, before
examining its single copy. We will ﬁnd that additional source terms appear in the gauge and
gravity ﬁeld equations, and in section 4 we relate these to scattering amplitudes describing
radiation, by considering the example of Bremsstrahlung. In section 5, we examine the well-
known energy conditions of GR for the solutions under study. Finally, we discuss our results
and conclude in section 6. Technical details are contained in an appendix.

2 Review of the Kerr-Schild double copy

Let us begin with a brief review of the Kerr-Schild double copy, originally proposed in [55,56].
We deﬁne the graviton ﬁeld via

gµν = ¯gµν + κhµν,

κ =

16πGN

(1)

(cid:112)

where GN is Newton’s constant, and ¯gµν is a background metric, which, for the purposes
of the present paper, we will take to be the Minkowski metric.6 There is a special class of
Kerr-Schild solutions of the Einstein equations, in which the graviton has the form

hµν = −κ
2

φkµkν,

(2)

consisting of a scalar function φ multiplying the outer product of a vector kµ with itself. We
have inserted a negative sign in this deﬁnition for later convenience. The vector kµ must be
null and geodesic with respect to the background:

¯gµν kµ kν = 0,

(k · D)k = 0,

(3)

where Dµ is the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric.
It follows
that kµ is also null and geodesic with respect to the metric gµν. These solutions have the
remarkable property that the Ricci tensor with mixed upstairs / downstairs indices is linear
in the graviton. More speciﬁcally, one has

where ¯Rµν is the Ricci tensor associated with ¯gµν, and we have used the fact that hµ
µ = 0.
It follows that the Einstein equations themselves linearise. Furthermore, ref. [55] showed
that for every stationary Kerr-Schild solution (i.e. where neither φ nor kµ has explicit time
dependence), the gauge ﬁeld

Aa

µ = caφ kµ,

(5)

for a constant colour vector ca, solves the Yang-Mills equations. Analogously to the grav-
itational case, these equations take a linearised form due to the trivial colour dependence
of the solution. We then refer to such a gauge ﬁeld as the single copy of the graviton hµν,
since it involves only one factor of the Kerr-Schild vector kµ rather than two. Note that the
scalar ﬁeld φ is left untouched by this procedure. This was motivated in ref. [55] by taking
the zeroth copy of eq. (5) (i.e. stripping oﬀ the remaining kµ factor), which leaves the scalar
ﬁeld itself. The zeroth copy of a Yang-Mills theory is a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory, and the
ﬁeld equation linearises for the scalar ﬁeld obtained from eq. (5). The scalar function φ then
corresponds to a propagator, and is analogous to the untouched denominators (themselves
scalar propagators) in the BCJ double copy for scattering amplitudes.

Source terms for the biadjoint, gauge and gravity theories also match up in a natural way
in the Kerr-Schild double copy. Pointlike sources in a gauge theory map to point particles
in gravity, where electric and (monopole) magnetic charge are replaced by mass and NUT
charge respectively [56]. Extended source distributions (such as that for the Kerr black hole
considered in ref. [55]) lead to additional pressure terms in the gravity theory, which are
needed to stabilise the source distribution so as to be consistent with a stationary solution.
Conceptual questions relating to extended source distributions have been further considered
in ref. [59], regarding the well-known energy conditions of general relativity. In this work, we
will consider point-like objects throughout, and therefore issues relating to extended source
distributions will not trouble us. Nevertheless we will discuss the energy conditions in sec-
tion 5 below.

Let us emphasise that the Kerr-Schild double copy cannot be the most general relationship
between solutions in gauge and gravity theories. Indeed, the ﬁeld one obtains upon taking
the outer product of kµ with itself is manifestly symmetric. Moreover, the null condition on
kµ means that the trace of the ﬁeld vanishes. Hence, the Kerr-Schild double copy is unable
to describe situations in which a two-form and / or dilaton are active in the gravity theory.
This contrasts sharply with the double copy procedure for scattering amplitudes, which easily
incorporates these ﬁelds. Furthermore, Yang-Mills amplitudes only obey the double copy
when written in BCJ dual form, meaning that certain Jacobi relations are satisﬁed by the
kinematic numerator functions [3–5]. It is not known what the analogue of this property is in
the classical double copy procedure. All of these considerations suggest that the Kerr-Schild
story forms part of a larger picture, and in order to explore this it is instructive to seek
well-deﬁned generalisations of the results of refs. [55, 56].

ticle

In this article, we will go beyond previous work on the Kerr-Schild double copy [55, 56] by
considering an accelerating point particle. This is a particularly attractive case, because an
accelerating point particle must radiate, so we may hope to make direct contact between
the double copy for scattering amplitudes and for Kerr-Schild backgrounds. We ﬁrst de-
scribe a well-known Kerr-Schild spacetime containing an accelerating point particle, before
constructing the associated single-copy gauge theoretic solution. We ﬁnd that the physics
of the single copy is particularly clear, allowing a reﬁned understanding of the gravitational
system. We will build on this understanding in section 4 to construct a double copy pair of
scattering amplitudes from our pair of Kerr-Schild solutions in gauge theory and gravity in
a manner that preserves the double copy throughout.

3.1 Gravity solution

Consider a particle of mass M following an arbitrary timelike worldline y(τ ), parameterised
by its proper time τ so that the proper velocity of the particle is the tangent to the curve

λµ =

dyµ
dτ

.

(6)

An exact Kerr-Schild spacetime containing this massive accelerating particle is known,
though the spacetime contains an additional stress-energy tensor; we will understand the
physical role of this stress-energy tensor below. A useful geometric interpretation of the null
vector kµ appearing in the solution has been given in refs. [60–62] (see ref. [63] for a review),
as follows. Given an arbitrary point yµ(τ ) on the particle worldline, one may draw a light

6

xykcone as shown in ﬁgure 1. At all points xµ along the light-cone, one may then deﬁne the null
vector

r = λ · (x − y)|ret ,

(7)

kµ(x) =

(x − y(τ ))µ

r

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ret

,

where the instruction ret indicates that y and λ should be evaluated at the retarded time τret,
i.e. the value of τ at which a past light cone from xµ intersects the worldline. Calculations
are facilitated by noting that:

∂µkν = ∂νkµ =
∂µr = λµ + kµ(−1 + rk · ˙λ),

where dots denote diﬀerentiation with respect to the proper time τ .

The Kerr-Schild metric associated with this particle is

gµν = ηµν − κ2

φkµkν

where kµ is precisely the vector of eq. (7) and diﬀerent functional forms for φ lead to diﬀerent
solutions. The scalar function corresponding to an accelerating particle is given by

Thus, the use of Kerr-Schild coordinates for the accelerating particle leads to the presence of
a non-trivial energy-momentum tensor on the right-hand side of the Einstein equations. We
can already see that this extra term vanishes in the stationary case ( ˙λµ = 0), consistent with
the results of ref. [55]. More generally, this stress-energy tensor T µν
KS describes a pure radiation
ﬁeld present in the spacetime. The physical interpretation of this source is particularly clear
in the electromagnetic “single copy” of this system, to which we now turn.

7We note what appears to be a typographical error in ref. [63], where the energy-momentum tensor
contains an overall factor of 4 rather than 3. We have explicitly carried out the calculation leading to
eq. (12), and found agreement with refs. [60–62].

3.2 Single copy

Having examined a point particle in arbitrary motion in a Kerr-Schild spacetime, we may
apply the classical single copy of eq. (5) to construct a corresponding gauge theoretic solu-
tion. This procedure is not guaranteed to work, given that the single copy of refs. [55,56] was
only shown to apply in the case of stationary ﬁelds. However, we will see that we can indeed
make sense of the single copy in the present context. Indeed, the physical interpretation of
the stress-energy tensor T µν
KS we encountered in the gravitational situation is illuminated by
the single copy.

The essence of the Kerr-Schild double-copy is a relationship between gauge theoretic solutions
Aµ = kµφ and Kerr-Schild metrics which is simply expressed as kµ → kµkν. Thus, the single-
copy of

hµν = −M κ

kµ,

(14)

(15)

where g is the coupling constant.9 Inserting this gauge ﬁeld into the Yang-Mills equations,
one ﬁnds that nonlinear terms vanish, leaving the Maxwell equations

where

∂µFµν = jKS ν,

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

(16)

(17)

is the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor.

A key result is that we ﬁnd that the current density appearing in the Maxwell equations is
given by

(18)

jKS ν = 2

k · ˙λ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ret

It is important to note that the current density jKS is related to the energy-momentum ten-
sor, eq. (13), we encountered in the gravitational case. Indeed the relationship between these
sources is in accordance with the Kerr-Schild double copy: it involves a single factor of the
Kerr-Schild vector kµ, with similar prefactors, up to numerical constants. We will return to
this interesting fact in the following section.

8In principle, one should include an arbitrary colour index on the ﬁeld strength and current density. Given
that the ﬁeld equations are abelian, however, we ignore this. The resulting solution can be easily embedded
in a non-abelian theory, as in refs. [55, 56]. Note that the abelian character of this theory also implies that
we make the replacement M κ
9The relative sign between hµν and Aµ is necessary in our conventions to ensure that positive masses yield
attractive gravitational ﬁelds while positive scalar potentials A0 are sources for electric ﬁeld lines E = −∇A0.

2 → g (cf. eq. (38) from ref. [55]).

8

The role of the Kerr-Schild current density jKS can be understood by examining our single-
copy gauge ﬁeld, eq. (15), in more detail. Let us compute the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength
tensor of this system. Using the results (8) and (9), it is easy to check that

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ =

g

4πr2 (kµλν − λµkν) .

(19)

A ﬁrst observation about this ﬁeld strength tensor is that it falls oﬀ as 1/r2 and does not
depend on the acceleration of the particle. Therefore, it does not describe the radiation ﬁeld
of the accelerated point particle in empty space, since the radiation ﬁelds must fall oﬀ as
1/r and are linear in the acceleration. Secondly, this tensor is manifestly constructed from
Lorentz covariant quantities. In the instantaneous rest frame of the particle, λµ = (1, 0, 0, 0)
and kµ = (1, ˆr), and in this frame it is easy to see that the ﬁeld strength is simply the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the point charge. Therefore, in a general inertial frame, our ﬁeld strength
tensor describes precisely the boosted Coulomb ﬁeld of a point charge, omitting the radiation
ﬁeld completely.

The absence of radiation in the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength makes the interpretation of
the current density jKS in the Maxwell equation obvious. This source must describe the
radiation ﬁeld of the point particle. To see this more concretely, let us compare our Kerr-
Schild gauge ﬁeld to the standard Li´enard-Wiechert solution Aµ
4πr λµ, which describes a
point particle moving in an arbitrary manner in empty space (see e.g. [64]). This comparison
is facilitated by deﬁning a “radiative gauge ﬁeld”

LW = g

where βµ = ˙λµ − λµk · ˙λ. Thus, F µν

rad = −jν
KS.

∂µF µν

We interpret jKS as a divergence of the radiative ﬁeld strength: we have put the radiation
part of the gauge ﬁeld on the right-hand side on the Maxwell equations, rather than the left.

Let us now summarise what has happened. By choosing Kerr-Schild coordinates for the
accelerating particle in gravity, an extra energy-momentum tensor T µν
KS appeared on the
right-hand side of the Einstein equations. The single copy turns an energy density into a
charge density (as in refs. [55, 56, 59]). Thus, the energy-momentum tensor in the gravity

9

theory becomes a charge current jµ
KS in the gauge theory. We have now seen that this current
represents the radiation coming from the accelerating charged particle, and this also allows
us to interpret the corresponding energy-momentum tensor on the gravity side: it represents
gravitational radiation from an accelerating point mass.

Indeed, our use of Kerr-Schild coordinates forced the radiation to appear in this form. The
vector kµ which is so crucial for our approach is twist-free: ∂µkν = ∂νkµ. It is known that
twist-free, vacuum, Kerr-Schild metrics are of Petrov type D, and therefore there is no grav-
itational radiation in the metric; see ref. [63] for a review. Correspondingly, the radiation is
described by the Kerr-Schild sources.

The radiation ﬁelds of the accelerating charge in gauge theory, and the accelerating point
mass in gravity, are described in Kerr-Schild coordinates by sources jµ
KS . The struc-
ture of these sources reﬂects the Kerr-Schild double copy procedure: up to numerical factors,
one replaces the vector kµ by the symmetric trace-free tensor kµkν to pass from gauge the-
ory to gravity. This relationship between the sources, which describe radiation, is highly
suggestive. Indeed, it is a standard fact that scattering amplitudes can be obtained from
(amputated) currents. We may therefore anticipate that the structural relationship between
the Kerr-Schild currents is related to the standard double copy for scattering amplitudes.

KS and T µν

Nevertheless, there are still some puzzles regarding the analysis above. What, for exam-
ple, are we to make of the diﬀerent numerical factors appearing in the deﬁnitions eqs. (13)
and (18) of the Kerr-Schild stress tensor and current density? If these sources are related
to amplitudes, we expect a double copy which is local in momentum space. How can our
currents be local in position space? More generally, how can we be sure that the Kerr-Schild
double copy is indeed related to the standard BCJ procedure? The answer to these questions
is addressed in the following section, in which we interpret the radiative sources directly in
terms of scattering amplitudes.

Before proceeding, however, let us comment on the physical interpretation of the particle in
the solutions under study. We considered how the particle aﬀects the gauge or gravity ﬁelds,
but we did not consider the cause of the acceleration of the particle, i.e. its own equation of
motion. In the standard Li´enard-Wiechert solution, the acceleration is due to a background
ﬁeld. It is therefore required that this background ﬁeld does not interact with the radiation,
otherwise the solution is not valid. This is true in electromagnetism or in its embedding
in Yang-Mills theory. However, in the gravity case, one cannot envisage such a situation.
Therefore, one should think of this particle merely as a boundary condition, and not as a
physical particle subject to forces which would inevitably aﬀect the Einstein equations. What
we are describing here is a mathematical map between solutions in gauge theory and gravity,
a map which exists irrespective of physical requirements on the solutions. In a similar vein,
ref. [59] showed that energy-momentum tensors obtained through the classical double copy
do not necessarily obey the positivity of energy conditions in general relativity.

4 From Kerr-Schild sources to amplitudes

In the previous section, we saw that the Kerr-Schild double copy can indeed describe radi-
ating particles. The radiation appears as a source term on the right-hand side of the ﬁeld
equations. In this section, we consider a special case of this radiation, namely Bremsstrahlung
associated with a sudden rapid change in direction. By Fourier transforming the source terms
in the gauge and gravity theory to momentum space, we will see that they directly yield
known scattering amplitudes which manifestly double copy. Moreover, the manipulations
required to extract the scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and in gravity are precisely
parallel. We will preserve the double copy structure at each step, so that the double copy
property of the scattering amplitudes emerges from the kµ → kµkν structure of the Kerr-
Schild double copy. In this way, we ﬁrmly establish a link between the classical double copy
and the BCJ double copy of scattering amplitudes.

In order to study Bremsstrahlung, we consider a particle which moves with velocity

λµ(τ ) = uµ + f (τ )(u(cid:48)µ − uµ),

(23)

where

f (τ ) =

(24)
and, in the interval (−, ), f (τ ) is smooth but otherwise arbitrary. This describes a particle
which moves with constant velocity λµ = uµ for τ < −, while for τ >  the particle moves
with a diﬀerent constant velocity λµ = u(cid:48)µ. Thus, the particle undergoes a rapid change of
direction around τ = 0, assuming  to be small. The form of f (τ ) acts as a regulator needed
to avoid pathologies in the calculation that follows. However, dependence on this regulator
cancels out, so that an explicit form for f (τ ) will not be needed. Owing to the constant
nature of u and u(cid:48), the acceleration is given by

(25)
The acceleration vanishes for τ < − and τ > , but is potentially large in the interval
(−, ). Without loss of generality, we may choose the spatial origin to be the place at which
the particle changes direction, so that yµ(0) = 0.

One may now Fourier transform this expression, obtaining a current depending on a mo-
mentum k conjugate to the position x. As our aim is to extract a scattering amplitude from
the Fourier space current, ˜jµ
KS(k), we consider only the on-shell limit of the current where
k2 = 0; we also drop terms in ˜jµ
KS(k) which are proportional to kµ as these terms are pure
gauge. The technical details are presented in appendix A, and the result is

(32)

We may now interpret this as follows. First, we note that the current results upon acting
on the radiative gauge ﬁeld with an inverse propagator, consistent with the LSZ procedure
for truncating Green’s functions. It follows that the contraction of ˜jν
KS with a polarisation
vector gives the scattering amplitude for emission of a gluon. Upon doing this, one obtains
the standard eikonal scattering amplitude for Bremsstrahlung (see e.g. [65])

We thus see directly that the additional current density in the Kerr-Schild approach corre-
sponds to the radiative part of the gauge ﬁeld.

4.2 Gravity

We now turn to the gravitational case. Our goal is to extract the eikonal scattering amplitude
for gravitational Bremsstrahlung from the Kerr-Schild stress-energy tensor T µν
KS for a particle
of mass M moving along precisely the same trajectory as our point charge. Thus, the
acceleration of the particle is, again,

˙λµ = ˙f (τ )(cid:0)u(cid:48)µ − uµ(cid:1) .

(34)

The calculation is a precise parallel to the calculation of the Bremsstrahlung amplitude
for the point charge. However, as we will see, the presence of an additional factor of the
Kerr-Schild vector kν in the gravitational case leads to a slightly diﬀerent integral which we
encounter during the calculation. This integral cancels the factor of 3 which appears in T µν
KS ,
restoring the expected numerical factors in the momentum space current. Let us now turn
to the explicit calculation.

We begin by writing the stress tensor as an integral over a delta function which enforces the
retardation and causality constraints
˙λ(τ ) · (x − y(τ ))

[λ(τ ) · (x − y(τ ))]4 (x− y(τ ))µ(x− y(τ ))νθ(x0− y0(τ ))δ(cid:0)(x − y(τ ))2(cid:1) , (35)

corresponding to eq. (28) in the gauge theoretic case. The fourth power in the denominator
in the gravitational case arises as a consequence of the additional factor of kµ = (x −
y(τ ))µ/[λ(τ ) · (x − y(τ ))]. As before, the integral is strongly peaked around yµ = 0, and we
may perform the integral in this region to ﬁnd that

Notice that the factor 3 in the numerator of the stress-energy tensor has cancelled due to the
additional factor of λ(τ )· (x− y(τ )) in the denominator of the integrand in the gravitational
case. The double copy structure is evidently now captured by a replacement of one derivative

Our next step is to Fourier transform to momentum space. The calculation is extremely
similar to the gauge theoretic case (again, see appendix A). As our goal is to compute a
scattering amplitude, we work in the on-shell limit k2 = 0 and omit pure gauge terms. After
a short calculation, we ﬁnd

KS (k) = −iM

To construct the scattering amplitude, we must contract this Fourier-transformed stress-
energy tensor with a polarisation tensor, which may be written as an outer product of two
gauge theory polarisation vectors:

µν(k) = µ(k)ν(k).

The scattering amplitude is then given by

(39)

corresponding to the known eikonal amplitude for gravitational Bremsstrahlung [66]. Again
we see that the additional source term in the Kerr-Schild approach corresponds to the ra-
diative part of the ﬁeld. Furthermore, in this form the standard double copy for scattering
amplitudes is manifest: numerical factors agree between eqs. (32) and (37), such that the
mass in the gravity theory is replaced with the colour charge in the gauge theory, as expected
from the usual operation of the classical single copy [55, 56].

Let us summarise the results of this section. We have examined the particular case of a
particle which undergoes a rapid change in direction, and conﬁrmed that the additional
source terms appearing in the Kerr-Schild description (in both gauge and gravity theory)
are exactly given by known radiative scattering amplitudes. This directly links the classical
double copy to the BCJ procedure for amplitudes.

It is interesting to compare the BCJ double copy for scattering amplitudes with the Kerr-
Schild double copy, which has been formulated in position space. It is clear that momen-
tum space is the natural home of the double copy. For scattering amplitudes, the am-
plitudes themselves and the double copy procedure are local in momentum space. In our
Bremsstrahlung calculation, the numerical coeﬃcients in the sources are also more natural
after the Fourier transform. On the other hand, the currents T µν
KS are also local
in position space. This unusual situation arises because the scattering amplitudes do not
conserve momentum: in any Bremsstrahlung process, some momentum must be injected in
order to bend the point particle trajectory. Of course, in the case of a static point particle
locality in both position space and momentum space is more natural. This is reﬂected by
the structure of the Fourier transform in the present case: as explained in Appendix A,
the factor 1/x · u describing a particle worldline Fourier transforms to an integrated delta

5 Gravitational energy conditions

In this section, we consider the null, weak and strong energy conditions of general relativity.
These were recently examined in the context of the Kerr-Schild double copy in ref. [59],
where it was shown that extended charge distributions double copy to matter distributions

14

that cannot simultaneously obey the weak and strong energy conditions, if there are no
spacetime singularities or horizons. Although the point particle solution of interest to us has
both singularities and horizons, it is still interesting to examine the energy conditions.

The null energy condition on a given energy-momentum tensor can be expressed by

Tµν(cid:96)µ(cid:96)ν ≥ 0,

(40)

where (cid:96)µ is any future-pointing null vector. The weak energy condition is similarly given by

Tµνtµtν ≥ 0,

(41)

for any future-pointing timelike vector tµ. The interpretation of this condition is that ob-
servers see a non-negative matter density. The null energy condition is implied by the weak
energy condition (despite the names, the former is the weakest condition). One may also
stipulate that the trace of the tidal tensor measured by such an observer is non-negative,
which leads to the strong energy condition
Tµνtµtν ≥ T
2

gµνtµtν, T ≡ T α
α .

(42)

Let us now examine whether these conditions are satisﬁed by the Kerr-Schild energy-momentum
tensor of eq. (13). First, the null property of the vector kµ implies that the trace vanishes,
so that the weak and strong energy conditions are equivalent. We may further unify these
with the null energy condition, by noting that eq. (13) implies

(cid:20)3M (k · V )2

(cid:21)

KS VµVν = (k · ˙λ)
T µν

4πr2

.

(43)

for any vector V µ. The quantity in the square brackets is positive deﬁnite, so that whether
or not the energy conditions are satisﬁed is purely determined by the sign of k · ˙λ. This
scalar quantity is easily determined in the instantaneous rest-frame of the point particle; it
is the negative of the component of acceleration in the direction nµ of the observer (at the
retarded time), see ﬁgure 2. Thus the energy conditions are not satisﬁed throughout the
spacetime. In particular, any observer which sees the particle accelerating towards (away
from) her will measure a negative (positive) energy density.

We remind the reader that the energy-momentum tensor is, in the case under study, an
eﬀective way of representing the full vacuum solution. The latter will have no issues with
energy conditions. Analogously, the Li´enard-Wiechert vacuum solution in gauge theory can
be represented, as we have shown in Section 3, by a boosted Coulomb ﬁeld, together with a
charged current encoding the radiation.

6 Discussion

In this paper, we have extended the classical double copy of refs. [55, 56] to consider ac-
celerating, radiating point sources. This signiﬁcantly develops previous results, which were

15

Figure 2: Physical interpretation of (k· ˙λ), where this denotes the component of acceleration
in the direction nµ.

based on stationary Kerr-Schild solutions, to a situation involving explicit time dependence.
The structure of the double copy we have observed in the radiating case is precisely as one
would expect. Passing from the gauge to the gravity theory, the overall scalar function φ
is left intact; indeed it is the well-known scalar propagator in four dimensions. This is the
same as the treatment of scalar propagators in the original BCJ double copy procedure for
amplitudes. Similarly, the tensor structure of the gravitational ﬁeld is obtained from the
gauge ﬁeld by replacing the vector kµ by the symmetric, trace-free tensor kµkν. Finally, our
use of Kerr-Schild coordinates in gravity linearised the Einstein tensor (with mixed indices).
Reﬂecting this linearity, the associated single copy satisﬁes the linearised Yang-Mills equa-
tions.

It is worth dwelling a little on the physical implication of our work. The classical double
copy is known to relate point sources in gauge theory to point sources in general relativity,
in accordance with intuition arising from scattering amplitudes.
In this article, we have
simply considered the case where the point sources move on a speciﬁed, arbitrarily accel-
erated, timelike worldline. On general grounds we expect radiation to be emitted due to
the acceleration. Our use of Kerr-Schild coordinates organised the radiation into sources
appearing on the right-hand side of the ﬁeld equations: a current density in gauge theory,
and a stress-energy tensor in gravity. Intriguingly, we found that the expressions for these
sources also have a double copy structure: one passes from the gauge current to the gravita-
tional stress-energy tensor by replacing kµ by kµkν while leaving a scalar factor intact, up to
numerical factors which are canonical in momentum space. Since these sources encode the
complete radiation ﬁelds for the accelerating charge and black hole, there is a double copy
between the radiation generated by these two systems. This double copy is a property of
the exact solution of gauge theory and general relativity.

16

nWe further extracted one simple perturbative scattering amplitude from this radiation ﬁeld,
namely the Bremsstrahlung scattering amplitude. The double copy property was maintained
as we extracted the scattering amplitude, which ﬁrmly establishes a link between the double
copy for amplitudes and the double copy for classical solutions.

However, we should emphasise one unphysical aspect of our setup. We mandated a wordline
for our point particle in both gauge theory and general relativity. In gauge theory, this is
ﬁne: one can imagine that an external force acts on the particle causing its worldline to bend.
However, in general relativity such an external force would contribute to the stress-energy
tensor in the spacetime. Since we ignored this component of the stress-energy tensor, our
calculation is not completely physical. Instead, one should regard the point particle in both
cases as a speciﬁed boundary condition, rather than as a physical particle. We have therefore
seen that the radiation generated by this boundary condition enjoys a precise double copy.

There are a number of possible extensions of our results. One may look at time-dependent
extended sources in the Kerr-Schild description, for example, or particles accelerating in
non-Minkowski backgrounds (for preliminary work in the stationary case, see ref. [56]). It
would also be interesting to examine whether a double copy procedure can be set up in
other coordinate systems, such as the more conventional de Donder gauge. One particularly
important issue is to understand the generalisation of the colour-dual requirement on kine-
matic numerators to classical ﬁeld backgrounds. The Jacobi relations satisﬁed by colour-dual
numerators hint at the existence of a kinematic algebra [12, 67] underlying the connection
between gauge theory and gravity; revealing the full detail of this structure would clearly
be an important breakthrough. The study of the classical double copy is in its infancy, and
many interesting avenues have yet to be explored.

A Fourier transform of source terms

In this appendix, we describe how to carry out the Fourier transform of eqs. (31, 36), to get
the momentum-space expressions of eqs. (32, 37).

where the integral is over non-negative values of m only, given that q0 > 0. Given that
θ(x0)δ(x2) is a retarded propagator10, one may also note the transform

F(cid:8)θ(x0)δ(x2)(cid:9) = −2π

q2 .

We then use the convolution theorem to obtain the Fourier transform of the current from eq.
(31). The theorem states that the Fourier transform of a product is equal to the convolution
of the transforms of each term. That is,

where the convolution operation in four dimensions takes the form

F{f · g} = F{f} ∗ F{g},

(cid:90)

(F ∗ G)(k) =

of eq. (32).

vanish when contracted with the graviton polarisation tensor. Substituting eq. (54) into
eq. (53), the m integral is straightforward, and one obtains the result of eq. (37).
