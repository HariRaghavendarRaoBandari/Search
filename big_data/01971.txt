Abstract

We report the results of Suzaku observations of the young supernova remnant, Vela Jr. (RX

J0852.0−4622), which is known to emit synchrotron X-rays, as well as TeV gamma-rays.

Utilizing 39 Suzaku mapping observation data from Vela Jr., a signiﬁcant hard X-ray emis-

sion is detected with the hard X-ray detector (HXD) from the north-west TeV-emitting region.

The X-ray spectrum is well reproduced by a single power-law model with the photon index

of 3.15+1.18

−1.14 in the 12–22 keV band. Compiling this with the soft X-ray spectrum simultane-
ously observed with the X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS) onboard Suzaku, we ﬁnd that the

wide-band X-ray spectrum in the 2–22 keV band is reproduced with a single power-law or con-

cave broken power-law model, which are statistically consistent with each other. Whichever

the model of a single or broken power-law is appropriate, clearly the spectrum has no rolloff

structure. Applying this result to the method introduced in Yamazaki et al. (2014), we ﬁnd

1

that one-zone synchrotron model with electron spectrum having a power-law plus exponential

cutoff may not be applicable to Vela Jr.

Key words: ISM: supernova remnants — ISM: individual objects (Vela Jr.) — acceleration of particles

1 Introduction

Several supernova remnants (SNRs) are known as sites of acceleration of cosmic-ray particles with
the energy of up to TeV. The ﬁrst observational evidence is discovered by Koyama et al. (1995) in
the X-ray band. They found X-rays from shell regions of SN 1006 with ASCA, and revealed that the
X-rays are produced via synchrotron radiation by TeV electrons.

We have not yet succeeded observationally in determining the maximum energy and acceler-
ation efﬁciency of protons and even electrons, which are the key to understand the acceleration site
of Galactic cosmic rays. In the context of diffusive shock acceleration, particles with a higher energy
require a longer acceleration time, while they have a shorter cooling and escape time (e.g. Drury
2011, Lagage & Cesarsky 1983). These timescales are functions of a diffusion coefﬁcient of accel-
erated particles around the shock (Bell 1987 and Ohira et al. 2010). Curvature in X-ray synchrotron
spectrum depends on the energy spectrum of highest-energy electrons there. Measuring the spectral
shape (i.e., slope or photon index, rolloff frequency and spectral curvature) expected to be observed
in the X-ray synchrotron emission is crucial to understand the environment and mechanism of cosmic
ray acceleration (Yamazaki et al. 2014, Yamazaki et al. 2015).

So far wide-band X-ray spectra have been extensively studied in several SNRs; e.g., RX
J1713.7−3946 (Takahashi et al. 2008, Tanaka et al. 2008), SN 1006 (Bamba et al. 2008), Cassiopeia
A (Maeda et al. 2009), and G1.9+0.3 (Zoglauer et al. 2015). Rolloff frequencies are reported from a
number of SNRs. Bamba et al. (2005a) reported the rolloff energies distributing 0.07 −11.6 keV, from
Cas A, Kepler SNR, Tycho SNR and RCW 86. Utilizing hard X-ray spectra obtained with NuSTAR,
the rolloff energies of > 2 keV and 1.27 ± 0.07 keV were observed from Tycho SNR (Lopez et al.
2015) and G 1.9+0.3 (Zoglauer et al. 2015), respectively. TeV gamma-rays have been also observed
from a number of SNRs, which are thought to be produced via inverse Compton scattering of TeV
electrons or via π0 decay process of high-energy protons (e.g., Aharonian et al. 2004).

The young SNR Vela Jr. (RX J0852−4622) was discovered by ROSAT in 1998 (Aschenbach
1998). It is one of TeV-emitting SNRs, and has a diameter of 2◦. It overlaps with the south-east
portion of much larger and known Vela SNR, and is situated near the pulsar and pulsar wind nebulae

2

(PWN) of Vela SNR. Vela Jr. has a synchrotron X-ray shell (Slane et al. 2001, Bamba et al. 2005b),
which is observed also in radio (Combi et al. 1999) and gamma-rays (Aharonian et al. 2005). Fukui
(2013) reported a spatial correlation between the radio emission from molecular clouds around Vela
Jr. and TeV gamma-rays. Magnetic ﬁeld strength at the shock surface of Vela Jr. has been estimated
by some authors. While Bamba et al. (2005b) estimated the ﬁeld strength, B ∼ 5 × 102µG from
the thickness of X-ray thin shell taken by Chandra, Kishishita et al. (2013) derived B ∼ 5–20 µG,
by comparing brightness distribution proﬁle at the shell in 2–10 keV with expected radial proﬁle by
Petruk et al. (2011). Lee et al. (2013) constructed 1D spherically symmetric model of non-linear
diffusive shock acceleration, and obtained B ∼ 4.8 µG from observation results, assuming synchron
X-rays and cosmic microwave background photon upscattered to TeV gamma-rays. The observed
spectral slope is so steep that we naturally expect that the synchrotron rolloff energy is below 1
keV, and the spectrum becomes much softer for higher energy bands. However, the synchrotron
emission above 10 keV has not been observed for Vela Jr., and thus the spectral shape has not yet
been determined. In order to determine the photon index and to examine the expected rolloff structure,
wideband X-ray observation covering above 10 keV is important. X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku
(Mitsuda et al. 2007) covers the energy range of 0.2–600 keV with four units of the X-ray Imaging
Spectrometers (XISs: Koyama et al. 2007) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD: Takahashi et al.
2007). Since both instruments have very low-background capabilities (Tawa et al. 2008; Fukazawa
et al. 2009), which enable us to perform high sensitivity surveys of X-rays, the Suzaku is most suitable
for diffuse objects. We report the ﬁrst result of spectral analysis of wideband observation of Vela Jr.
with Suzaku. We describe Suzaku observations and data reduction of Vela Jr. in section 2, summarize
results of analysis in section 3, and present a discussion in section 4.

2 Observation and Data Reduction

We preformed 40 mapping observations of Vela Jr. and its close vicinity in 2005 December, 2007
July, and 2008 July. Table 1 shows the observation details. Hereafter, we refer to each observation
position in an abbreviated style by clipping each object name. For example, we call Vela Jr P1 as P1,
and RXJ 0852−4622 NW as NW.

One of the two types of instruments of Suzaku is a set of the XISs, each of which is installed
on the focal plane of an individual set of the X-ray telescopes (XRTs: Serlemitsos et al. 20061).
The XIS covers a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 17′.8 × 17′.8 with the angular resolution of 2′ in half power
diameter in the energy range of 0.2–12 keV. The XIS 0, 2, and 3 are front side illuminated (FI) CCDs,

1 http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/doc/suzakumemo/suzakumemo-2006-34.pdf

3

whereas XIS 1 is a back-side illuminated (BI) CCD. FI CCDs are more sensitive in the energy band
above 5 keV because the depletion layers are thicker than that of a BI CCD. We use only XIS 0, 1,
and 3 data because XIS 2 has not been operated since 2007. Spaced-row charge injections (Nakajima
et al. 2008, Uchiyama et al. 2009) were carried out in all the observations except NW and NW offset.
We use the software package Heasoft 6.12 with CALDB 2009-08-04 for the analysis and XSPEC
v12.7.1 for the spectral analysis2. Each observation data is reprocessed by aepipeline 1.0.1. We
extract events based on the following criteria: elevation angle from night earth > 5◦, elevation angle
from day earth > 20◦. We remove calibration source regions at the corner of the FOV.

The HXD is a well-type phoswitch counter, whose main detection-part consists of silicon
detectors and GSO crystal scintillators. The silicon PIN type semiconductor detector covers hard
X-ray band of 10–70 keV, and has FOV of 34′ × 34′. The GSO crystal scintillators cover the band
of 40–600 keV. We do not present the result of GSO because no signiﬁcant detection is made. Since
the well-type active shield provides low-background environment for the PIN detector, it is one of the
ideal detectors to observe low surface-brightness objects like SNRs. We extract events which have an
elevation angle of > 5◦ and geomagnetic cut-off rigidity of > 6 GV.

3 Spectral analysis

3.1 XIS

We begin with the analysis of the XIS data. Figure 1 shows the mosaiced XIS image of Vela Jr.
in 2–5 keV, which is created with ximage, combining the exposure and vignetting-effect corrected
image of each observation. Shell structures of Vela Jr. are clearly visible. We focus on the NW shell
which is detected in TeV gamma-rays (Katagiri et al. 2005) and reportedly shows bright synchrotron
X-ray ﬁlaments (Bamba et al. 2005b). In order to match the data with those of the HXD-PIN, we
selected the region inside the FOV of the PIN NW observation which is a square sky region with
apexes of (133.37, −45.69), (132.17, −46.45), (131.09, −45.61) and (132.29, −44.86) in equatorial
coordinates. Consequently, the entire regions of NW, P1, P2, P3, P4, P11 and P12, and parts of P5,
P6, P9, P10, P13, P14, P15, P16 and P17 are included. The spectra are summed with mathpha in units
of counts without exposure weighting. The errors are propagated as Poisson errors. Response ﬁles
are created with marfrmf from redistribution matrix ﬁles (rmfs) made by xisrmfgen and ancillary
response ﬁles (arfs) made by xissimarfgen (Ishisaki et al. 2007), based on the XIS 2–5 keV image
ﬁle within the FOV of the PIN NW observation. We add all the XIS responses of each observation
with the weight of each exposure.

Fig. 1. The mosaiced XIS image of Vela Jr. in 2–5 keV band. The exposure is corrected, but the CXB is not subtracted. The regions of the calibration sources

are removed. The green and magenta boxes show the FOVs of the XIS of all the observations and of the PIN during NW observation, respectively. The

coordinates are in the J2000 equatorial system.

Since the object extends toward the outside of XIS FOV, we should evaluate background spec-
tra carefully. We here employed the XIS spectra from the observation RXJ 0852−4622 NW offset
(table 1: NW offset) as the background spectra. However, we must consider the difference in NXB by
the difference of the observation days. The NW offset spectra were obtained in winter of 2005, while
the source spectra are the sum of observations in winter of 2005 and summer of 2007. In order to
evaluate the possible temporal variation of NXB, we made background spectra (A) by replacing NXB
component. The NXB component of each occation is reproduced by xisnxbgen which makes use
of the NXB database of the night-earth observations by Tawa et al. (2008) extracting the data from 4
months before to 16 months after an observation. In addition, to examine possible contaminate source
in NXB offset FOV, we compare the background spectra with the NXB plus the CXB estimated by
Kushino et al. 2002 (B). Above backgrounds are summarized in ﬁgure 2 and we conﬁrmed the back-
ground spectra are consistently reproduced within the errors. Then, we safely adopt the NW offset
background ignoring the energy range of 5.9 ± 0.2 keV also to eliminate scattered 55Fe line from the
decaying calibration source during the observations.

We evaluate background-subtracted XIS spectra by ﬁtting with a power-law function with
the Galactic absorption: phabs*powerlaw. The absorption column density is ﬁxed to be 6.7 × 1021
cm−2, which is the best-ﬁt value derived by Hiraga et al. (2009), with the metal abundance adopted
from Anders & Grevesse (1989). We ignore the energy range of below 2 keV to avoid thermal
contamination from Vela SNR (Hiraga et al. 2009). Figure 3 shows the XIS spectra, and Table 2
shows the best-ﬁt parameters.

3.2 HXD-PIN

To identify pointings which show signiﬁcant hard X-ray signals with HXD-PIN, we compare the
background-subtracted count-rates of each observation with the systematic error of the corresponding
simulated background spectrum. We employ a modeled CXB by Boldt & Leiter (1987) and sim-
ulated NXB spectrum with hxdpinxbpi, the latter of which is calculated on the basis of observed
NXB spectrum during earth occultation. The expected uncertainty of the NXB model is reported
as 3% in 10–60 keV by Fukazawa et al. (2009). The PIN detection signiﬁcance is determined with
the NXB reproducibility. Since hard X-ray sources RCW 38 and IGR J09026–4812 contaminate the
NW offset observation, those offset observations are not to used to estimate the NXB and CXB back-
grounds for this HXD-PIN analysis. We ignore the energy band below 12 keV to avoid thermal noise.
Consequently, we obtain 6 observations that exceed 1 σ signiﬁcance level of NXB uncertainty in the

6

10–60 keV band: P1, P2, P3, P5, P13, and NW, all of which are located in the north-west of Vela Jr.

To conﬁrm the detections, we re-evaluate uncertainty of the NXB model for each observa-
tion by comparing the count rate of CXB-subtracted signal with that of each simulated NXB in the
10–60 keV band. For the NXB, we derive the count rate during earth occultations during each ob-
servation. All but the NW contained some periods of earth occultations. For the NW observation,
we used the earth occultation data obtained in the observations conducted immediately before and 26
hours after the NW observation: E0102−72 (ObsID 100044010) and NGC 4388 (ObsID 800017010).
Comparing those with the count rate of the model, we estimate the systematic uncertainties of the
NXB model to be ∼ 7%, 6%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 9%, and 1% for positions P1, P2, P3, P5, P13, and NW,
respectively, in 10–60 keV. P1, P2, and P13 have larger uncertainty than the nominal value reported in
Fukazawa et al. (2009) because the exposures of earth occultation were short. A signiﬁcant emission
to 21.9 keV from the position NW is detected at 3 σ conﬁdence level, whereas those from the other
observations are detected at only 0.5–1.5 σ level.

In order to examine the PIN spectrum of diffuse objects, we need to calculate the effective
areas for which the angular response is convolved (‘arf’ in the XSPEC), based on the source bright-
ness distribution within the FOV. We assume that the spatial distribution in the hard X-ray band with
PIN is the same as the CXB-subtracted XIS 2–5 keV images (section 3.1). The proper response of
the PIN detectors has a pyramidal shape. However, for simplicity, we divide the spatial distribution
within the PIN FOV by 9 × 9 grids and make 81 arfs in total with hxdarfgen, assuming that a point
source centered in each section is responsible for the entire ﬂux from the section in making an arf in
each section. Then we sum up these arfs with addarf with weights calculated from the XIS image.
Practically, this procedure is to approximate the original pyramidal angular response by 9 × 9 prisms.
We calculate the ratio of the geometric integrations of the 81 prisms to the pyramid to be 0.8. Thus,
the ﬂux based on this arf should come out at the value 1/0.8 = 1.25 times larger than the real one.

We validate this ratio of the normalizations with another pair of data sets: (A) the effective
area derived with this method for the 9 × 9 section with a uniform weight, (B) that calculated from
the numerically-simulated ﬂat-sky response ﬁle, which is delivered by the HXD team. We conﬁrm
that the ratio of the former (A) to the latter (B) is ∼0.8 and so is consistent with the value calculated
above.

Now that the method is validated, we make the arf for our HXD-PIN spectrum with this
method, assuming the HXD-PIN spatial distribution of Vela Jr. to be the same as the CXB-subtracted
brightness distribution observed with the XIS. We ﬁnd that 39 out of the 81 sections inside Vela Jr.
show no signiﬁcant XIS signal and hence give them the weight of zero in calculating the arf for the
HXD-PIN spectrum. Figure 4 displays the employed sections, and Table 3 lists the weights. All the

7

ﬂux and ﬂux values presented hereafter are corrected for the above-mentioned factor.

Using the arf for Vela Jr. NW with the ofﬁcially delivered responses for the ﬂat sky and a point
source, we examine the observed hard X-ray spectrum in detail. First, we evaluate possible contami-
nation of the galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE: Krivonos et al. 2007), given the fact that Vela Jr.
is on the Galactic plane. We use the NXB-subtracted XIS spectrum of the offset observation as the
background template for the HXD data of Vela Jr. We ﬁt it with, in addition to the ﬁxed CXB model
(Kushino et al. 2002), the GRXE model, for which we employ a photo-absorbed two temperature
thermal plasma emission model. Assumed absorption column density NH = 4.0 × 1022cm−2 and the
two temperature thermal plasma model (apec in XSPEC) with kT = 1.66 keV and 15.1 keV (Table
4 of Yuasa et al. 2012). Considering the effective solid angle of PIN and XIS, we then estimate the
GRXE component ﬂux for the PIN spectrum (12 – 22 keV) and XIS spectrum (2 – 10 keV) to be
2.00 × 10−13 and 7.01 × 10−13 erg cm−2s−1, respectively. This estimated GRXE model is included
in all the following model-ﬁttings of the HXD-PIN spectrum. Note that the ﬂux of GRXE in the XIS
range is 2% of that from NW. Therefore, the effect of the GRXE to the XIS spectrum is negligible.

Second, we check the possible contamination from nearby hard X-ray sources. According
to the INTEGRAL catalog3, there was no contaminating point-source in the 18.3–59.9 keV range in
the FOV of the HXD-PIN. The brightest diffuse source in the PIN FOV is Vela PWN below 10 keV
(Katsuda et al. 2011). Mori et al. (2014) studied the spectrum of Vela PWN with the XIS observation
of VELA PWN E7 (ObsID 506050010), and reported that the surface brightness is ∼ 0.3 times CXB
level and that the photon index is ∼ 3.3. This ﬂux corresponds to 5% of that of the NW in the 2–10
keV band, and hence our XIS spectrum is not signiﬁcantly affected with the Vela PWN component
within statistics. Extrapolating this spectrum to the energy band of the HXD-PIN, we ﬁnd that the
ﬂux of Vela PWN is ≤ 2% of that of the NW in the 12–22 keV energy range, and therefore the
contribution from the Vela PWN component is negligible for the PIN data. Therefore, we conclude
that the detected signals are fully originated from Vela Jr. NW.

Finally we ﬁt the background-subtracted HXD-PIN spectrum up to 22 keV with a single
power-law model. Figure 5 shows the spectrum with the best-ﬁt model. The systematic error of
the NXB model of 1%, which is derived based on the earth occultation data, is included in errors of
the source spectrum. The spectrum is well reproduced by a single power-law model with χ2/d.o.f.
∼ 0.22. The best-ﬁt photon index is 3.15+1.18
−1.14and the ﬂux is (8.26 ± 1.44) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 in
12–22 keV, as listed in table 2. Here the errors due to the model-ﬁtting error of the GRXE are 0.006%
for the photon index and 0.02% for normalization.

3.3 Wide-band spectrum

In sections 3.1 and 3.2, we have derived the spectral parameters independently with the XIS and PIN.
We then ﬁt the XIS and PIN spectra simultaneously to give further constraints, making use of the best
available statistics.

First, we apply a single power-law model, referred to as model (i) in Table 4, linking the
photon index for the XIS and PIN spectra. Ishida et al. (2007)4 reported that the normalization factors
differed between the XIS and PIN spectra for the point-like source Crab, which has a power-law
spectrum, and that their ratio of the PIN to the XIS (henceforth referred to as the cross-normalization)
was 1.13. Thus, we link the power-law normalizations of the XIS and PIN spectra with the ratio of
1/1.13 in the model-ﬁtting. Figure 6 shows the spectra and the best-ﬁt model, and Table 4 lists the
best-ﬁt parameters.

The X-ray spectra of several SNRs have rolloff structures (e.g. Takahashi et al. 2008, Tanaka
et al. 2008, Bamba et al. 2008, Zoglauer et al. 2015). Although the above result on a single power-
law model does not require any spectral bending in the 2–22 keV band, we further try to examine
a possible spectral curvature with various models listed in Table 4, setting the cross-normalization
to 1.13 (see the previous sub-section). Table 4 shows the best-ﬁt parameters of each model. Four
panels in ﬁgure 6 show the spectrum overlaid with the best-ﬁt model spectra for 4 different models.
The parameters with the cutoff power-law (cutoffpl in XSPEC) which is a power-law model with
high energy exponential rolloff (ii) are consistent with the results with the single power-law model
(i), because the lower limit of rolloff energy of 131 keV is out of the range. Fitting with the broken
power-law model (iii; bknpower in XSPEC) implies the breaking energy of 7.90 ± 0.18 keV with a
change of spectral index of −0.3, although it is still consistent with the results of individual ﬁttings
with the XIS and PIN, and with the wide-band ﬁttings with the models (i) and (ii), within errors.

4 Discussion and Summary

In section 3, we have shown the results of spectral analysis of Vela Jr. with Suzaku. X-rays with the
energy up to 22 keV are detected from the north-west region of Vela Jr. The spectra in the soft and
hard X-ray band are reproduced with a power-law model with the photon indices of 2.93 ± 0.02 and
−1.14, respectively. When the spectra in both the bands are ﬁtted simultaneously, a single power-
3.15+1.18
law model with the photon index of 2.92 ± 0.01, or a slightly concave-shaped broken power-law
model, is accepted.

The obtained wide band steep power-law like spectrum with photon index ∼ 3 implies the
energy index p ∼ 5 of synchrotron electron with the energy distribution of dN/dE ∝ E −p. This steep
spectrum strongly suggests that the rolloff energy is well below the XIS band. Combi et al. (1999)
reported the radio spectral index of α = 0.3 ± 0.3 at NW region, and Duncan et al. (2000) reported the
ﬂux density at 1 GHz of ∼ 50 Jy from entire region of the SNR. In order to verify consistency between
the X-ray and radio results, the X-ray spectra with XIS and PIN are tested with srcut model in

11

XSPEC (Reynolds 1998). The srcut model describes the synchrotron spectrum from electrons with
an exponentially-rolloff power-law distribution in energy. The synchrotron spectrum has a power-law
form from radio band to X-ray band with a rolloff energy. The srcut model has three parameters;
X-ray rolloff energy, spectral index at 1 GHz, and ﬂux at 1 GHz. We ﬁt the X-ray spectra using
spectral index α in radio band reported by Combi et al. (1999) and typical value of young SNRs, i.e.,
α = 0.3 and α = 0.6, respectively. Then, when α = 0.3, the best ﬁt parameters of 1 GHz ﬂux density
and rolloff energy of 0.15 ± 0.01 Jy and 0.15 ± 0.01 keV with χ2/d.o.f. of 1.18. When α = 0.6, these
are 31.6+1.8
−1.9 Jy and 0.27 ± 0.01 keV with χ2/d.o.f. of 1.17. The area of NW region in this paper is ∼
27 % of entire Vela Jr., hence the 1 GHz ﬂux is expected to become smaller than values reported by
Duncan et al. (2000) which is derived from emission of entire Vela Jr. Actually the derived radio ﬂux
is smaller than the value of entire Vela Jr. reported by Duncan et al. (2000). In addition, rolloff energy
is below the XIS band, which is consistent with our X-ray analysis. Therefore results of our X-ray
analysis and in radio band are consistent each other. Since the radio ﬂux at NW region alone has not
been reported, additional radio observation is needed to verify this result on wideband spectrum of
the NW region.

Thus the steep X-ray spectrum naturally requires concave rolloff structure as far as we assume
simple acceleration/synchrotron cooling mechanism. For example, Yamazaki et al. (2014) proposed
a simple diagnostic to ﬁnd possible acceleration mechanisms from the observed spectral shape near
the maximum energy, assuming (a) one-zone, (b) electron energy spectrum of an exponential cutoff
power-law (N(E) ∝ E −p exp[−(E/Emax,e)a]) expressed as equation 1 in Yamazaki et al. (2014), and
(c) synchrotron radiation. Figure 5 in Yamazaki et al. (2014) shows the relation between the electron
spectral parameters p and a on the relation of soft and hard X-ray spectral indices.

In order to discuss theoretical models, we tried a ﬁtting with a broken power-law model (iv)
with the ﬁxed breaking energy to 10 keV. Table 4 shows the best-ﬁt parameters of this model, and
lower right panel of Figure 6 is the spectrum overlaid with the best-ﬁt model spectra. Both the derived
photon indices are consistent with that obtained with the model (iii), though that in the hard band is
marginally smaller by 0.1 than the latter. The best-ﬁt ﬂux is close to that obtained in the models (i)
and (ii). Figure 7 overlays our results of the photon indices of below and above 10 keV in the model
(iv) in red on Figure 5 in Yamazaki et al. (2014). We ﬁnd that our data do not ﬁt any of the theoretical-
model lines by Yamazaki et al. (2014). Thus we ﬁnd Vela Jr. is the second outlier of the theoretical
lines following Cassiopeia A, despite the spectrum in higher energy than rolloff. They are unlike the
other SNR RX J1713.7−3946 whose spectral shape is well described with power-law + exponential
cutoff model, exhibits the soft and hard photon indices on one of the theoretical lines.

A possible cause for the mismatch is that at least one of the assumptions (a), (b) and (c) is

12

incorrect for this object. A normal one-zone synchrotron X-ray spectrum usually has a photon index
of ∼ 2 in a softer energy band and rolls off toward the harder energy band due to cooling or escape.
However the wide-band X-ray spectrum of Vela Jr. is well reproduced with a single power-law or
even a concave-shape broken power-law. It may suggest that combination of more than one emission
component and/or complex emission mechanisms creates the observed X-ray spectra (Longair 1994,
Drury et al. 1999, Zirakashvili & Aharonian 2007, Malkov & Drury 2001, Toptygin & Fleishman
1987, Medvedev 2000, Reville & Kirk 2010, Teraki & Takahara 2011, Yamazaki et al. 2006, Laming
2001, Vink & Laming 2003, Vink 2008, Ohira et al. 2012).

In addition, in order to validate the cross-normalization between the XIS and the PIN, we
ﬁt the spectra, allowing both the XIS and PIN normalizations to vary independently, and ﬁnd that
the best-ﬁt photon index and the XIS ﬂux are consistent with the above-discussed case within the
error range, whereas the derived cross-normalization factor is 1.4 ± 0.3, which is marginally larger
than that reported for the point source. This result may imply that brightness distribution in hard
X-rays is more compact than that of the XIS image and that we have actually underestimated the PIN
effective area, as we have assumed a larger diffuse-emission region than the real one. Considering the
case of more compact hard X-ray brightness distribution than that of soft X-rays, we also showed a
conservative ﬁtting result with freed cross-normalization factor in ﬁgure 7 with blue mark and error
bars. The best-ﬁt photon indices are 2.93 ± 0.04 and 3.16+2.44
−2.20 in the soft and hard energy range,
respectively. Although this estimation accepts most of the model lines presented in Yamazaki et al.
(2014), it requires more than one emission region or complex emission mechanisms.

Lastly, we show ﬂux comparison with TeV emission.

In section 3.1, we derived the ﬂux
of (4.43 ± 0.03) × 10−11erg cm−2 s−1 in 2–10 keV band while Aharonian et al. (2007) showed the
TeV ﬂux of entire Vela Jr. of (15.2 ± 0.7 ± 3.20) ± 10−12cm−2s−1 with H.E.S.S. Both band spectra
exhibit similar slope and the X-ray to TeV gamma-ray ﬂux ratio is ∼ 2.91. If we assume the cosmic
microwave background inverse Compton scattering as TeV emission mechanism, we estimate the
magnetic ﬁeld B ∼ 5.5 µG, which is consistent value derived by Kishishita et al. (2013) and Lee et al.
(2013). If the TeV emission is hadronic, the ﬁeld strength is not constrained and it may be much
higher (Bamba et al. 2005b).
